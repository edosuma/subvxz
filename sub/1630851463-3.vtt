WEBVTT

00:08.299 --> 00:10.510
Previously, on
Top Chef Family Style.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.596
Your job is to create
the most luxurious dish.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.057
So, you went full
on with the truffle.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.393
Yeah, it's the only
mushroom I like.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.478
I'm really excited
to work with truffles.

00:20.520 --> 00:23.273
Is it crazy that I can't.
taste the truffle?

00:23.314 --> 00:26.609
I'm going to fry them Danny.
Okay, okay.

00:27.902 --> 00:31.489
The winning chefs are
Delilah and Danny.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.784
Taylor and Elizabeth,

00:34.826 --> 00:37.871
-please pack your knives and go.
-I'm really proud of you.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.875
-11 duos remain.
-I can't reach!

00:41.916 --> 00:44.044
-Voila.
-We killed that.

00:44.085 --> 00:47.922
At stake, $50,000 and the chance

00:47.964 --> 00:51.718
to be crowned the champions
of Top Chef Family Style.

01:00.977 --> 01:04.230
-Whoa!
-Whoo!

01:04.272 --> 01:06.649
-Oh, my God.
-Hi, Marcus. Nice shades.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.151
What's up, guys?

01:08.193 --> 01:11.613
-Good morning, Chefs!
-Good morning.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.491
-Anybody like sports?
-I love sports.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.118
Then, you're gonna love this.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.996
Chefs, we're calling
an audible.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.792
Today there will be
no quickfire challenge.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.171
Instead, you'll be competing

01:28.213 --> 01:30.632
in an epic elimination
challenge.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.966
What?

01:36.388 --> 01:38.473
Are you guys ready
for some football?

01:38.515 --> 01:42.477
-Yes!
-Please join us in welcoming

01:42.519 --> 01:45.480
LA Rams linebacker Kenny Young.

01:45.522 --> 01:49.901
And the 2021 LA Rams
draft class.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.661
Sup, guys?
Welcome.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.663
Thank you, guys.
Happy to be here.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.416
All right, chefs, it's time
to get your game face on.

02:06.668 --> 02:09.170
-That's it.

02:09.212 --> 02:12.674
For this elimination challenge,
you're going to be competing

02:12.716 --> 02:15.969
in the Top Chef Family Style
tailgate tournament.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.138
Ooh.

02:18.179 --> 02:22.350
Today your task will be feeding
all of these guys.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.352
Oh, Lord.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.188
-And us.
-And that's not all, guys.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.692
We also invited 50 NFL fans.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.236
-50?
-Oh, my God.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.280
This is tailgate style.
Come on now.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.032
Yeah!

02:37.073 --> 02:40.285
Let's go. I love tailgates,
I love football.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.287
We're a big football family.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.581
I am so excited
for this challenge.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.250
I'm more excited that I get
to cook outside on grills.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.546
We have a very special guest
judge for this challenge.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.550
Please welcome America's mom,
Tabitha Brown.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.720
-Oh, my God!

02:58.762 --> 03:01.139
Oh, my God!

03:01.181 --> 03:04.309
Tabitha Brown is just amazing.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.728
-I love you!
-I love you as well.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.563
-So excited.
-We love her videos.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.523
We just love her
as an overall person.

03:10.565 --> 03:12.567
I pre-ordered
her cookbook, actually.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.653
I am a foodie.
I love a good tailgate honey.

03:15.695 --> 03:18.073
My daddy is a diehard
football fan.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.492
So, I was like,
"Oh, let me go on in here."

03:21.159 --> 03:23.036
And one more thing.

03:23.078 --> 03:27.874
Tabitha is also a plant
based food influencer.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.462
That's right, Chefs.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.965
Today's tailgate will be
100% plant based.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.844
Climate change is a big issue.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.097
And right now is the time
to really fix that.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.766
So I'm happy that this
is a challenge that we get

03:44.808 --> 03:46.768
to show people, you can make
good plant based food

03:46.810 --> 03:48.728
and still help the environment.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.939
I love plant base. It's a big
part of my offseason diet.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.441
I feel healthy.
I don't feel groggy at night.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.777
It's great for me
in my profession.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.738
The tailgate tournament
consists of three rounds.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.991
First up, everyone will cook
in the wild card round,

04:02.033 --> 04:04.828
making an All-Star
appetizer platter.

04:04.869 --> 04:07.664
The top six dishes
from the wild card round

04:07.706 --> 04:10.500
will move on to compete
in the championship round,

04:10.542 --> 04:12.669
making everyone's
tailgate favorite

04:12.711 --> 04:16.089
-a mouth-watering burger.
-Plant based burger?

04:16.131 --> 04:19.592
The best burger will be crowned
tailgate champions

04:19.634 --> 04:21.594
and will win
the elimination challenge.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.141
The five chef teams
who do not move on

04:26.182 --> 04:29.102
to the championship round
will literally fight to stay

04:29.144 --> 04:33.773
in the competition. Where they
must make their best grill plate

04:33.815 --> 04:35.734
and our least favorite dish
from that round

04:35.775 --> 04:37.527
will be eliminated.

04:38.111 --> 04:42.032
Plant based food on an open
grill is kind of scary.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.659
Chefs, you'll only have 20
minutes in the kitchen...

04:44.701 --> 04:46.161
-Huh?
-What?

04:46.202 --> 04:48.413
...to shop for whatever
your team needs.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.789
Oh!

04:49.831 --> 04:51.499
That's it! That's it.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.251
For all three rounds.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.836
Oh, three rounds.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.505
Shop smart, because once
you leave the kitchen,

04:57.547 --> 04:58.965
there's no going back.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.262
All right, chefs, your
20 minutes starts right now.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.014
Good luck, good luck!

05:06.056 --> 05:08.141
Kill it!

05:12.228 --> 05:14.647
Brookie, did you get garlic?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.232
This competition
is definitely harder

05:16.274 --> 05:17.734
than I thought
it would be.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.028
I don't know anything
about plant based

05:20.070 --> 05:22.572
or the plant based life.
Got the pine nuts.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.783
Now, let's go over
this gazpacho.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.744
So far, we've been making things
we're very familiar with,

05:27.786 --> 05:30.747
gazpacho's definitely
in our comfort zone.

05:30.789 --> 05:34.167
Tomatoes, garlic, cucumber,
red onion, green pepper.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.378
A steady pace wins the race.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.171
10 minutes, 30 seconds, guys.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.673
I got vegan eggs.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.716
I got the bread,
I got the chickpea flour.

05:41.758 --> 05:45.387
Does anyone have cumin
that I could take some of?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.347
-Is that cilantro?
-Yes.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.391
We're making samosas.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.518
I think I just need two.

05:51.559 --> 05:55.397
We got this challenge, because
my mom is plant based at home.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.065
It's very light for your body

05:57.107 --> 05:58.733
and then you'll feel
more energetic.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.193
I have whole-wheat flour.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.112
I don't really watch
a lot of football,

06:02.153 --> 06:06.074
but I play a lot of sports.
I like to win.

06:06.116 --> 06:09.911
-Oh, how do you feel?
-I don't know.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.871
-Cornmeal?
-Yes.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.791
-You got the buns?
-I got-- go get buns!

06:14.833 --> 06:20.505
Five, four, three, two, one!

06:20.547 --> 06:21.923
Hands up.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.550
Oh, my God.
This is like stressful.

06:26.469 --> 06:30.932
Welcome to the first ever
Top Chef Family Styletailgate.

06:30.974 --> 06:31.975
Yeah.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.727
We're gonna have a great time.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.353
Here come our chefs.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.697
Yes.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.949
Chefs, this is
the wild card round

06:47.991 --> 06:50.035
for our tailgate tournament.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.997
You have 45 minutes to make
your best appetizer platter,

06:54.039 --> 06:56.666
and your time
starts now.

06:59.002 --> 07:02.297
Let's go chefs!
Let's go chefs!

07:02.339 --> 07:03.548
Whoo!

07:03.590 --> 07:05.300
Let's go chefs!

07:05.342 --> 07:07.969
-What are you starting on?
-I'm getting the roti going...

07:08.011 --> 07:10.263
Alright, Dad. We done been
in the middle twice.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.724
So today we got to bring it.
Like, we gotta at least

07:12.766 --> 07:14.559
-be on the top.
-I'm not worried, Jack.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.145
We'll get to the top
of this thing.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.439
Okay, Danny, get the stuff
for the cheese.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.149
What are you guys doing?

07:21.191 --> 07:24.361
We're gonna be making elotes
and our own cheese.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.904
Elote, it's something
we traditionally have

07:25.945 --> 07:27.989
after a soccer game.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.408
So, as a tribute to all the
street vendors out there--

07:30.450 --> 07:33.495
The hardest part is trying
to mimic the Cojitacheese.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.913
Should I put all of them?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.540
Our idea is to soak the cashews,

07:37.582 --> 07:39.417
put it in the food processor.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.003
I think we should leave it out
here to dry.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.005
With plant based,
seasoning is so important.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.049
-Yeah.
-To get that palate right.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.010
-You a football fan?
-Little bit.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.762
-What's your favorite team,
-Broncos.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.389
Oh, nice, nice. Same here.

07:52.430 --> 07:56.351
The thing about Hawaii is that
there's no big NFL team,

07:56.393 --> 07:59.229
so everybody just adopts
a team from somewhere else

07:59.270 --> 08:01.523
and everybody just kind of
competes with each other.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.775
Essentially,
it's like beet nachos.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.485
That's cool.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.362
I've made
a lot of poke nachos,

08:07.404 --> 08:09.280
but never quite like this.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.075
What we're going to do
is incorporate seaweed

08:12.117 --> 08:14.202
and all of the seasonings that
we would normally use

08:14.244 --> 08:18.123
with a fish poke to really
replicate the same flavors.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.750
I'm going to go get these
sweet potatoes ready and fried.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.091
-What are we missing Brooke?
-Bell pepper.

08:29.050 --> 08:31.261
We have made
gazpacho before.

08:31.302 --> 08:34.723
Just a little bit, because
we're going to use Tabasco.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.516
It's her father's favorite dish.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.309
It's refreshing.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.979
So I think the judges are going
to like it on this hot day.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.981
I figured out how to use
this though.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.275
We're very short
on time, okay?

08:45.316 --> 08:49.070
I need a cup of flour...

08:49.112 --> 08:51.656
We've made this pizza
a lot with plant based items.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.991
Thinner.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.951
Thinner? Never on a grill.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.371
But we do it all the time.
That's fine.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.379
Look at those beautiful
grill marks.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.014
I'm so upset we've been
in the bottom twice.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.600
Makes it seem like we don't
know how to cook and we do.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.603
We clearly do. Nobody else
is in the bottom twice.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.355
I feel like
the worst chef here.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.940
To cover Kobe beef
is not respecting

09:25.982 --> 09:28.943
one of the best ingredients
in the world.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.403
I think making
our homemade roti,

09:30.445 --> 09:32.405
making it a red pepper
baba ghanoush

09:32.447 --> 09:34.616
is going to really
make it go that extra mile.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.993
I am a good chef and I'm going
to show these judges

09:37.035 --> 09:39.079
that I can learn from what
they have to say.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.414
There's a lot of foods that are
plant based in Pakistan.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.291
So, you know, I just really
had to think about

09:43.333 --> 09:44.918
what my grandma
would make right now.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.544
Which is funny
because we're making

09:46.586 --> 09:47.962
what my grandma would make.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.631
-Yeah.
-We call it to-fish.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.174
So almost like fried fish.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.510
-But with tofu.
-It's battle of the grandmas.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.637
Khalil, of course,
bringing that flavor.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.222
A little tofu game.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.807
They got a little
Cajun seasoning.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
So I'm excited
to see what that's about.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.061
-Being a Louisiana kid.
-Yeah!

10:03.103 --> 10:05.230
-36 minutes.
-Beautiful.

10:05.271 --> 10:06.481
Awesome.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.193
We have to impress
the judges big time

10:10.235 --> 10:12.987
with this avocado tartar
and a sweet potato crisp.

10:13.029 --> 10:17.075
Tabitha Brown, she has a huge
platform on TikTok,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.578
and I kind of have a large
following as well.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.039
Let's make a Beef Wellington.

10:23.081 --> 10:27.669
I really aspire to be like her
inspiring young people

10:27.711 --> 10:30.380
-to just...
-Cook.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.007
-You know, just--
-Get in the kitchen.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.675
-Just inspire--
-Do what feels good.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.218
-Oh, my God!
-Sorry.

10:36.094 --> 10:38.763
-I need to be on the fryer.
-Go.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.059
I can cook three courses
that's easy.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.687
-Cooking in this heat, though?
-It's so hot.

10:45.729 --> 10:46.980
I'm making a pizza flatbread.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.440
What about you guys?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.191
We're making fresh
spring rolls.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.110
That seems hard to make
in 45 minutes.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.112
Kennedy is talking
about their dish

10:54.154 --> 10:55.864
and they also made
a summer roll.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.657
She called it a spring roll.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.368
Right. The things that make
our summer roll creative

11:00.410 --> 11:02.954
are the smoked tofu
and the sauce.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.415
It should be something
a little bit unique.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.044
-Liz.
-Yup?

11:09.085 --> 11:11.546
-Did you put fish sauce in this?
-Yeah.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.340
It's not plant based.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.508
Oh, shoot.
Make a new batch!

11:15.550 --> 11:19.095
With four grills going,
it's so hot.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.890
-Your brain turns off.
-How much time do we have?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.392
-Fifteen minutes.
-We can't get them as thin

11:24.434 --> 11:27.395
as we normally would,
but I think it's working.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.106
The tough part about samosas
is that you have to do

11:30.148 --> 11:32.233
one by one,
that takes some time.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.693
We got to start frying.

11:33.735 --> 11:35.111
-Ugh!
-It's okay.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.280
Just work with more flour.
You got it.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.240
I'm literally dumping
the whole bag on here.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.369
It's so hot. The dough starts
sticking to the countertop.

11:42.410 --> 11:45.080
-Thirteen minutes.
-Don't melt on me now, bud.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.174
Wait, it's hot.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.926
Why don't you do it
on the wood board?

11:57.967 --> 11:59.678
Because the whole thing
has been baking,

11:59.719 --> 12:02.472
so that's why you're having
problems. Roll it out, kid.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.516
It's really challenging working
with dough in this heat,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.559
but it's finally turning out
the way that we want.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.646
-How long do those take to cook?
-Like five.

12:09.688 --> 12:11.523
Five minutes?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.316
We're gonna be
cutting it close.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.405
All right.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.198
Looking nice.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.866
Yeah. I think we're still going

12:21.908 --> 12:23.785
to have to deep
fry them, though.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.286
Should I put these on--

12:25.328 --> 12:26.996
No, I can do them,
I can do them.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.415
Go, go, plate.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.583
Jack, watch the pizzas,
are they burning?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.627
Shoot.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.338
Pour it in, pour it in.
Go. We need to plate.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.632
-Start plating.
-Right now.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.092
Kennedy, how are you feeling
on time?

12:39.134 --> 12:41.886
A little stressed out.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.596
One minute, 45 seconds.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.266
You want to start to cut
because we need two platters.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.560
Because we had to make
a new soy vinaigrette.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.312
It took away a lot
of time to assemble them.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.565
We're going to be taking
this down to the wire.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.859
-Run!
-We're not going to have time

12:55.900 --> 12:57.444
to get the crema on.

12:57.485 --> 13:01.072
Where's the tongs?
My dough is perfect.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.366
But my pizza sauce
is a little bit watery.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.453
It's never loose. It's never.

13:07.078 --> 13:09.539
54 seconds.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.251
-Oh no. I broke one.
-Be careful.

13:13.293 --> 13:19.424
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

13:19.466 --> 13:25.096
five, four, three, two, one.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.473
Hands up.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.146
Here we go.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.648
Here we go. Here we go.
Yes! I'm excited.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.235
Khaleel, will you tell us what
you made for us?

13:39.277 --> 13:41.446
Today, we made
what we called tofish

13:41.488 --> 13:43.907
which is kind of like
a spin on fried fish

13:43.948 --> 13:46.284
and a spicy Cajun tartar sauce.

13:46.326 --> 13:49.454
-That's all right. Right there.
-Yeah, great flavor.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.790
How do you guys know how to do
the Cajun spin on it?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.626
A lot of people who live in
Houston are from Louisiana.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.336
So when you
go to a restaurant,

13:56.378 --> 13:58.672
there's a lot of Cajun
things on the menu.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.341
-Love the texture.
-This is pretty good, man.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.593
-Thanks, Khaleel and Willie.
-Thank you, guys.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.720
It's good stuff.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.555
-Oh. Wow.
-Hi, guys.

14:07.597 --> 14:10.558
What we have for you
is a baba ghanoush bite

14:10.600 --> 14:14.312
with roti
and a cucumber onion relish.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.523
-You made the roti here?
-Yes.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.024
Beautiful.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.651
This is a great piece
of grilled bread

14:19.693 --> 14:21.861
-with a nice depth.
-You can feel that love in it.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.988
So I loved it.
Really good.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.824
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.826
Presentation!

14:27.867 --> 14:29.536
-Hi!
-Hi.

14:29.577 --> 14:33.456
We made fresh spring rolls
with a roasted peanut sauce.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.875
Not warm, vegetables tastes
so good in the sun.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.128
-You know, great tailgate snack.
-Thank you.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.838
What I love about
the spring roll

14:39.879 --> 14:42.257
is the way you wrapped it,
because a spring roll,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.342
if you get it all in your hand,
it doesn't work.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.262
-So welcome back, Kennedy.
-Thank you.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.265
-Is that peanut sauce?
-Yeah.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.852
What appetizers did you
make for us, Milan?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.187
Tomato sauce eggplant capers.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.523
All on a delicious
homemade flatbread.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.067
You made the flatbread
on the grill?

15:01.109 --> 15:02.485
Yeah.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.195
Go with your bad self
then, okay.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.865
You guys are so good
with bringing in flavor.

15:06.906 --> 15:11.286
But a tad thinner, would make it
a little bit more crispier.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.413
-Uh-huh.
-Thank you.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.666
Brooke and Carol,
what did you make for us?

15:16.708 --> 15:20.337
Gazpacho shooters
with avocado and croutons.

15:20.378 --> 15:21.921
It's a really hot day

15:21.963 --> 15:24.924
and we figured this would be
a little refreshing.

15:24.966 --> 15:29.095
-Yeah, it's refreshing.
-Thank you so much.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.473
So would that be like salsa?

15:31.514 --> 15:33.224
That's a chilled soup
from Spain.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.227
-Okay.
-Hi, Anika and Anu.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.147
We made samosas with
our own spice blend

15:39.189 --> 15:42.609
and a tamarind
and a coriander chutney.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.944
For me,
the filling ratio to dough

15:44.986 --> 15:46.738
is not really correct.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.324
-Is it feeling too little?
-Yes.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.911
-I loved it.
-Thank you.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.162
Good.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.293
What's up, Delilah? Oh.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.128
Yeah, there you go,
that's better.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.589
We made you a roasted elote

16:04.631 --> 16:07.092
with a roasted
poblanomayonnaise

16:07.133 --> 16:09.761
and plant based Cojitacheese.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.971
That seasoning that
you have around it.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.640
It tastes so good.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.600
And honestly,
I will eat 20 of these.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.102
Thank you.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.728
I make this all the time

16:18.770 --> 16:21.898
and I don't make my cheese
from scratch. I buy it.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.609
It's so light.
It's like a corn dog.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.613
-Aloha!
-Aloha!

16:28.655 --> 16:31.616
Today we made you guys,
a beetroot poke nacho.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.994
It's a beetroot salad on top of
a fried sweet potato chip

16:35.036 --> 16:37.163
and a little bit
of sriracha mayo on the top.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.915
Oh, wow.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.126
Honestly, this would make
an Instagram post.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.961
This is amazing.
Kudos to you guys.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.629
Woop woop!

16:44.671 --> 16:47.632
-You guys crushed it.
-Thank you, all. Thank you.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.427
Dang. I wish I could cook
like this when I was young.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.470
Hi, Jack and Bobbie.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.390
We made a margarita pizza
triple thin crust.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.351
We added basil,
pickled Fresno chilis.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.811
Triple thin,
what does that mean?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.855
Thin crust pizza
but like super, super thin.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.606
-Super, super, super thin.
-Yeah.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.983
Got it.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.193
The dishes overall,
it checks the box.

17:07.235 --> 17:11.322
But it's not hitting home
because of the tomato sauce.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.158
Gives like that watery
kind of taste.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.660
And it just leaves it with
a tomato like flat taste.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.288
-Thank you.
-Cool.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.665
-Yes.
-Hello.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.794
We made a smoked tofu summer
roll with a soy vinaigrette.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.964
You have the noodles in there.
You have the cashews.

17:28.006 --> 17:30.008
You have the ambition
of smoking tofu.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.470
But you have to give yourself
enough time to wrap it right

17:33.511 --> 17:35.263
because it just opened up.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.390
It wasn't wrapped
the correct way.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.602
It's about planning
to get it right,

17:40.643 --> 17:42.395
because this dish
deserves that,

17:42.437 --> 17:46.232
-that vinaigrette is beautiful.
-Okay. Yeah.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.490
-What's up, Eva and Jenn?
-What's up?

17:53.531 --> 17:57.494
So, today for you, we have
an avocado tartare

17:57.535 --> 17:59.704
on a sweet potato crisp.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.832
-This sweet potato chip?
-It's so good.

18:02.874 --> 18:04.501
Yeah.

18:04.542 --> 18:06.503
It's loaded with flavor.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.713
I have like a little bit
of the pickle,

18:08.755 --> 18:10.382
-a little bit of the sweet.
-Thank you.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.300
A whole lot of avocado.
I love it.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.845
You made an amazing chip with
some beautiful flavors on it.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.889
-Great job.
-Thank you.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.393
Okay, judges, it's time to vote
for our favorite dishes.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.395
Cast your vote
and then pass it to me.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.733
Just start off
with the top or bottom.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.153
Okay, Chefs, the votes are in.

18:32.195 --> 18:36.825
Our six favorite dishes
from the wild card round are...

18:49.796 --> 18:52.132
Okay, chefs, the votes are in.

18:52.173 --> 18:55.301
Our six favorite dishes
from the wildcard round

18:55.343 --> 18:58.054
are Khaleel and Willie.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.018
Ocean and Jaydene.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.646
Kennedy and Rosie.

19:06.688 --> 19:09.357
Delilah and Danny.

19:09.399 --> 19:12.068
Kiran and Moid.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.987
And Eva and Jenn.

19:16.698 --> 19:19.200
-Congratulations to all of you.
-Yeah!

19:19.242 --> 19:22.704
You six teams will move on
to the championship round

19:22.746 --> 19:25.999
for the chance to win
the tailgate tournament.

19:26.041 --> 19:29.377
Unfortunately, Anika and Anu,
Carol and Brooke,

19:29.419 --> 19:33.965
Jack and Bobbie, Milan and
Chandrani, and Kaj and Liz,

19:34.007 --> 19:36.634
this means you had
our least favorite dishes.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.511
You'll get a chance
at redemption

19:38.553 --> 19:41.097
in the Hail Mary round where
you'll fight to remain

19:41.139 --> 19:43.683
in the competition,
because our least favorite dish

19:43.725 --> 19:45.852
from this round
will be going home.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.272
It's getting hot in the sun.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.441
Championship round, chefs.

19:51.483 --> 19:55.528
You'll have 45 minutes to make
a mouth-watering burger.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.364
-Are you ready?
-Yeah.

19:57.405 --> 20:00.075
Your time starts now.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.998
Okay.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.250
Isn't Beyoncé plant based?

20:09.292 --> 20:10.710
If Beyoncé does it!

20:10.752 --> 20:12.754
If Beyoncé does it, Imma do it.

20:13.672 --> 20:17.300
Feels good to be on top man.
Now it's just a fight to win,

20:17.342 --> 20:19.135
and we have not won
a challenge yet.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.262
No more of that.
We're going to win.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.431
The difficult part
about a plant based burger

20:23.473 --> 20:26.101
is you still want the meaty,
juicy textures

20:26.142 --> 20:27.686
and the flavors
and everything.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.354
But we've got to do it
vegetables.

20:29.396 --> 20:32.482
Trying to put together a spicy
south west black bean,

20:32.524 --> 20:36.236
and Portobello mushroom burger.
Whoo! This thing is hot.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.821
If it turns out amazing,

20:37.862 --> 20:39.698
we might be making
plant based burgers at home.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.949
I could see that.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.118
With a little bit of meat in it.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.245
Welcome to the top, Kiran.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.747
-How does it feel?
-It feels so much better, man.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.791
What all are you putting
in the burger?

20:49.833 --> 20:51.543
I want a black bean
burger for sure.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.837
It can't be too wet because
then it won't stay together.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.922
I'm adding a bunch of grains
to really get

20:55.964 --> 20:57.507
that chewy texture that feels
like it's a burger,

20:57.549 --> 21:00.093
chickpea flour,
and a shoot ton of season mix.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.095
I love a burger on the grill.

21:02.137 --> 21:05.181
Use a black bean,
you can use rice flour.

21:05.223 --> 21:06.766
Secrets!

21:06.808 --> 21:09.602
Every herb you can think of is
going to go into this burger.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.312
We have not made
this burger before.

21:11.354 --> 21:14.691
It is a spin on falafel
or fried herb turkey burger.

21:14.733 --> 21:17.193
Frying our burger is different

21:17.235 --> 21:19.612
than everything
everybody else is doing,

21:19.654 --> 21:21.114
and that's where we want to be.

21:21.156 --> 21:24.117
Originality is key
to our success.

21:24.159 --> 21:26.036
-How's that?
-Good.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.620
I need to start dredging
these burgers.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.205
Let me make them
and you dredge them,

21:29.247 --> 21:31.624
-how many did I make you?
-Stop talking.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.044
-Excuse me?
-Hold on.

21:34.085 --> 21:36.629
Have you lost your mind?

21:39.507 --> 21:41.134
Got to get the seeds out.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.928
We're using jackfruit
for our pulled pork.

21:43.970 --> 21:47.307
In Mexico, when we have
a fresh jackfruit,

21:47.349 --> 21:49.476
it shreds apart almost as if
it's a meat.

21:49.517 --> 21:51.770
Jackfruit does not smell good.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.814
I've never eaten
jackfruit before.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.692
But I'm putting
all my trust in Danny.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.361
What are you
working on, Danny?

21:59.402 --> 22:02.489
The sauce. The barbecue sauce
will do all the work.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.824
I cooked with jackfruit once
and did pulled pork.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.868
Oh, really? How'd it turn out?

22:06.910 --> 22:09.204
-It didn't taste good.
-Oh, okay.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.622
30 minutes!

22:12.832 --> 22:15.168
-What are you guys making?
-Eggplant burger.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.545
-Oh!
-And avocado with a slaw.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.172
Nice.

22:19.214 --> 22:21.049
I want you to start focusing
on your eggplant, Mom.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.926
Kennedy. I got to get
this going. I'm almost done.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.844
I've never made
this dish before.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.180
I always make my burgers
with meat at home.

22:27.222 --> 22:28.932
Hey! Being from Alaska,

22:28.973 --> 22:31.351
we all eat lots and lots
of moose burger,

22:31.393 --> 22:34.229
-which never gets old.
-I just think they're so good.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.606
We want this, Kennedy.
We need this.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.526
We want something
that's kind of back home.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.528
When you think
of tailgating and grilling,

22:41.569 --> 22:44.322
like some kind of edamame
teriyaki kimchi burger.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.532
Cool.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.283
Oh, if you have
any extra avocado...

22:47.325 --> 22:49.035
-Definitely do.
-Thank you.

22:49.077 --> 22:51.287
Can't go home. So why not
help my friends? Right?

22:51.329 --> 22:53.331
So, if it was an elimination,
maybe not?

22:53.373 --> 22:56.084
Let's not talk
about that part.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.211
Our barbecue sauce,
it needs to cook.

22:58.253 --> 23:00.338
It needs to warm up faster.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.966
I need the onions to be done.
I need to make hummus, too.

23:03.008 --> 23:04.634
Yeah, Dad, get on this.

23:04.676 --> 23:08.388
Kiran has a really, really
big personality and--

23:08.430 --> 23:10.557
-Is that a compliment?
-Yeah.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.058
Doesn't feel like one.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.185
This is way too hot.
I'm gonna add more flour.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.895
Don't do it like this.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.856
-Kiran, Kiran.
-No, Dad. Dad. Dad.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.818
No, no, you can't say that.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.236
We have code words
that are just names

23:23.278 --> 23:25.071
and different fruits
when we feel

23:25.113 --> 23:26.906
like the other person's
not listening to us.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.241
I'm telling you,
they're going be fine.

23:28.283 --> 23:29.993
And it's going to help bind it.

23:30.035 --> 23:31.703
The code word hasn't worked.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.496
Every time we don't listen.

23:33.538 --> 23:35.665
Yeah. This is much more
what I want.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.792
Fifteen minutes!

23:39.419 --> 23:41.421
-Looking good.
-How's that sauce going?

23:41.463 --> 23:47.093
Perfect. We are becoming known
for our depth of flavors,

23:47.135 --> 23:48.928
and this lemon dill sauce

23:48.970 --> 23:51.556
is really what's going
to keep that going.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.016
Taste it.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.020
-What?
-So good.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.938
Flipping the burgers.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.732
Did you make the chutney?

24:00.774 --> 24:02.692
Dad, what is happening?
What are you doing?

24:02.734 --> 24:05.195
Stop doing what I'm doing
and do what you need to do.

24:05.236 --> 24:07.155
Oh, my God. They actually
look all right.

24:07.197 --> 24:08.782
-Did you use flour?
-Yeah.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.033
I'm proud of you, Ocean.

24:10.075 --> 24:12.285
13 minutes.

24:12.327 --> 24:14.287
Khaleel, my patties
won't firm up.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.915
This is killing me right now.
Oh, my God.

24:16.956 --> 24:20.168
I'm freaking out about how this
thing is coming off this pan.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.295
Half of me doesn't want
to give it to the judges.

24:22.337 --> 24:23.713
-Ugh!
-Watch out.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.090
What?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.466
Are you out here with a torch?

24:26.508 --> 24:28.593
-I want it to be crispy.
-There's no time.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.429
And it's literally
falling apart, bro.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.098
Five minutes.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.600
-I really like the color.
-Definitely.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.477
Feeling pretty
confident about this dish.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.021
Trim the bottom.
It shouldn't hang off so far.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.898
These look good.

24:41.940 --> 24:43.692
Just they're so delicate.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.360
Oh, yeah. This is good.

24:45.402 --> 24:47.362
-Got some more sauce on top.
-Oh, yeah.

24:49.030 --> 24:52.492
That's the egg!
Oh, my God, Mom.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.077
It's okay. It's okay.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.995
I'm thinking
this is the lemon dill sauce,

24:56.037 --> 24:58.498
But it's the vegan egg dredge,

24:58.540 --> 25:02.627
she used to dredge
the burgers prior to frying.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.921
We'll do it, it's fine.
Stop screaming.

25:04.963 --> 25:06.256
Watching Eva and Jenn
losing it.

25:06.297 --> 25:08.008
Right? She poured something
on there

25:08.049 --> 25:09.634
that wasn't supposed
to go on there.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.594
-That needs a lot of sauce.
-I'm really hoping

25:11.636 --> 25:13.513
that the judges don't taste
the egg dredge.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.181
We need more on this.

25:15.223 --> 25:16.975
It's just not a good flavor
that you want to eat.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.102
Where's the pickled onion?
Where's the pickled onions?

25:19.144 --> 25:20.687
-They're on them!
-I'm loving them.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.731
You gotta put pickles
on the top of them too.

25:22.772 --> 25:24.441
-Here's the tops.
-Get the sticks.

25:24.482 --> 25:26.609
-Two minutes.
-Make sure it's nice.

25:26.651 --> 25:28.361
Put it on here.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.780
You know what I'm thinking, Dad?
We can call it a loose burger.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.533
We eat loose burgers at home.
And this is a loose burger.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.411
-Are you trying to be funny?
-We gotta hurry.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.996
We've got to clean the plate.

25:38.038 --> 25:39.789
Clean the plates,
clean the plates, towel.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.458
Clean the plates.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.835
Just tell them it's meant
to be eaten with a fork.

25:48.506 --> 25:49.883
Time's up, guys.

25:57.015 --> 25:59.267
Yes. Yes. Mmm.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.728
Oh, this is looking so good.

26:03.188 --> 26:06.066
Kennedy and Rosie,
tell us about your burger.

26:06.107 --> 26:10.820
We made a charred eggplant
patty with soy chorizo spread

26:10.862 --> 26:12.697
and then a red cabbage slaw.

26:14.866 --> 26:17.702
-I think we nailed it.
-I love my job.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.663
Kennedy, you always
bring layers of flavors.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.832
But one of the challenges
with this burger

26:22.874 --> 26:24.668
is it gets a little mushy.

26:24.709 --> 26:27.504
In a wrap it would be
like the perfect texture.

26:27.545 --> 26:31.466
For a burger, I'm looking
for more of a texture thing,

26:31.508 --> 26:33.677
but it's still the flavors.
Very good.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.845
Thank you.

26:35.887 --> 26:37.555
Delilah and Danny.

26:37.597 --> 26:41.434
We made a red and black bean
burger with tofu inside.

26:41.476 --> 26:45.522
And then we also made a shredded
pork with barbecue sauce,

26:45.563 --> 26:48.983
-red cabbage and apple coleslaw.
-So yummy.

26:49.025 --> 26:52.487
You keep coming here with
dishes packed with flavor.

26:52.529 --> 26:54.406
What did you make
your shredded pork out of?

26:54.447 --> 26:55.990
-Jack fruit.
-Come on!

26:56.032 --> 26:57.784
-All right. Okay.
-Beautiful.

26:57.826 --> 27:00.203
Just a clean barbecue sauce.
That's what it tastes like.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.163
-Good job, Delilah.
-Thank you.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.000
Ocean and Jaydene.

27:05.041 --> 27:08.378
We made an edamame burger
with a teriyaki glaze,

27:08.420 --> 27:10.630
and a cabbage kimchi on top.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.340
This all just feels
so good, man.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.134
I wish I had been vegan.

27:15.176 --> 27:17.679
The sauce with the edamame
is so good.

27:17.721 --> 27:20.390
I would not think
burger for that.

27:20.432 --> 27:23.059
But it's burger,
just with a different flavor.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.603
It's kind of like messing
with my head a little bit.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.732
Kiran and Moid. Come on up.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.900
I have a mushroom
black bean burger

27:30.942 --> 27:34.738
with an avocado mint chutney.
And a garlic confit hummus.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.407
I love the texture.
It's together.

27:37.449 --> 27:39.409
It has
a little crunchiness to it.

27:39.451 --> 27:40.952
-Amazing.
-Thank you.

27:40.994 --> 27:44.164
I love to watch you
take in the information

27:44.205 --> 27:46.624
and then just watch you cook.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.002
Because this black bean burger
is really good.

27:49.044 --> 27:54.591
That slowly cooked garlic
in the hummus is delicious.

27:54.632 --> 27:56.301
Thank you.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.971
All right, Eva and Jenn.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.849
We have a chickpea herb burger.

28:02.891 --> 28:06.436
With a dill aioli,
pickled red onions,

28:06.478 --> 28:09.064
tomato, on a toasted brioche.

28:09.105 --> 28:10.440
It's perfect.

28:10.482 --> 28:12.567
This is probably
the smartest concept.

28:12.609 --> 28:15.153
It's fried, it stands out.
It's original.

28:15.195 --> 28:16.738
That's one of
the most important things

28:16.780 --> 28:18.698
about becoming a chef,
originality.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.534
I love the idea of chickpeas,
one of my favorites.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.912
But the dill. I love
a dill pickle on a sandwich

28:23.953 --> 28:26.706
and you put the dill in the--
it's perfect.

28:26.748 --> 28:28.458
It's a good combination
of flavor.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.959
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Thank you.

28:30.001 --> 28:32.128
Thank you all so much.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.797
Khaleel and Willie!

28:33.838 --> 28:36.966
We made a southwest loose
black bean and mushroom burger

28:37.008 --> 28:39.803
with an avocado mash
and a Pico de Gallo,

28:39.844 --> 28:42.097
because at home we eat
a lot of loose burgers

28:42.138 --> 28:43.723
and I feel like a good burger.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.433
Like your hands
should be really dirty

28:45.475 --> 28:46.893
when you finish eating it.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.603
So a loose burger
is like a messy burger?

28:48.645 --> 28:50.230
-Like a messy burger.
-Okay.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.606
I think that is one
of the challenges,

28:51.648 --> 28:53.108
it was just too loose.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.651
You know,
everything else is good.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.444
But personally,
I didn't like the mushiness.

28:56.486 --> 28:58.530
Flavor, amazing. Texture...

28:58.571 --> 29:00.323
-It's just a little bit off.
-Yeah.

29:00.365 --> 29:04.035
Man, that loose burger didn't
really work out on this one.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.997
Okay, judges, it's time
to pick our winning dish.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.582
On the scorecard
in front of you,

29:09.624 --> 29:11.960
please cast your vote
and then pass it to me.

29:18.216 --> 29:20.093
Whew, it's hot.

29:20.677 --> 29:22.429
All right, the results are in.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.724
You guys, this was really,
really close.

29:26.725 --> 29:29.185
And the winners
of the Top Chef Family Style

29:29.227 --> 29:32.814
tailgate tournament are...

29:36.985 --> 29:38.403
Eva and Jenn.

29:41.156 --> 29:43.408
I'm the sweaty king!

29:45.326 --> 29:47.370
I did not expect this coming.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.080
Yeah!

29:49.122 --> 29:50.498
We've won an immunity challenge,

29:50.540 --> 29:52.917
and we've now won
an elimination challenge.

29:52.959 --> 29:58.256
It gives us the confidence to
know that we can put it down

29:58.298 --> 30:00.884
at every challenge
that we're handed.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.887
Not only are you the winners
of our tailgate tournament,

30:03.928 --> 30:05.388
Oh, my God...

30:05.430 --> 30:07.849
You've also won a trip
and two tickets

30:07.891 --> 30:10.769
to a Sunday night
football game of your choice.

30:10.810 --> 30:13.563
Oh, my God!

30:13.605 --> 30:16.316
Tickets are brought to you
by our friends at Peacock!

30:16.358 --> 30:18.651
And NBC Sunday Night Football.

30:18.693 --> 30:21.529
My brother loves football
and we've never been

30:21.571 --> 30:24.449
to an NFL game before.
Oh, my God!

30:24.491 --> 30:27.160
It's such an amazing
opportunity for my kids.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.788
I'll sit outside of the
parking lot and wait for them,

30:29.829 --> 30:32.540
but I want them to experience...

30:33.833 --> 30:36.461
-this game together.
-As we said before,

30:36.503 --> 30:39.631
it was very, very close.
So we want to give

30:39.673 --> 30:42.092
an honorable mention
to our two teams

30:42.133 --> 30:45.887
that tied for second place,
Kiran and Moid.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.934
And Delilah and Danny!

30:52.352 --> 30:53.812
Second place, man.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.855
We're not in the bottom anymore,
it's amazing.

30:55.897 --> 30:58.108
Chefs, you may head back
to your stations.

30:58.149 --> 31:00.235
Great job, guys!

31:00.276 --> 31:02.070
Good job, everybody!

31:02.112 --> 31:04.197
Hardest challenge ever!

31:04.239 --> 31:07.826
Okay, chefs. Next up
is the Hail Mary round.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.621
You'll have one hour to make
your best grilled plate.

31:11.663 --> 31:14.666
And our least favorite dish
will be going home.

31:15.041 --> 31:17.293
Your time starts now.

31:23.008 --> 31:25.010
I wanna stick my head
in the cooler.

31:26.177 --> 31:29.806
We just started
the Hail Mary round,

31:29.848 --> 31:32.851
and Brooke is white as a ghost.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.645
Guys, it looks like Brooke's
not doing well.

31:36.688 --> 31:41.026
So I took her back
to where there was a canopy.

31:42.360 --> 31:44.487
I'm really worried about her.

31:53.747 --> 31:55.832
We notice that Brooke and Carol
aren't there,

31:55.874 --> 31:57.792
which I'm a little
worried about.

31:58.209 --> 32:01.504
Thinking, "What happened and are
they going to be okay?"

32:09.095 --> 32:11.306
Chefs, we just want to let you
know that Brooke

32:11.348 --> 32:13.683
is not feeling well and she's
getting some medical attention

32:13.725 --> 32:15.060
and we'll see how she's doing.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.811
-Oh no.
-We'll let you know.

32:16.853 --> 32:19.147
I hope that nothing serious
is happening.

32:19.189 --> 32:22.150
As bad as we feel,
we can't dwell on that.

32:22.192 --> 32:25.195
We have to keep on going because
this is the Hail Mary round

32:25.236 --> 32:26.863
and someone's going home.

32:26.905 --> 32:29.240
This has to be like
the best taco we've made.

32:32.535 --> 32:35.830
Let's go chefs!
Let's go chefs!

32:35.872 --> 32:38.667
So, Mom, I think we're going
to do cauliflower steaks.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.710
Yeah, I'll make the curry.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.962
We eat a lot of plant based
diet at home.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.131
And I feel like this is
something that we make

32:45.173 --> 32:47.967
pretty often.
It feels very bad being one of

32:48.009 --> 32:50.929
the least favorite dishes
on a plant based challenge

32:50.970 --> 32:55.141
because my mom is plant based.
Yeah, it's a shame.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.612
We really have to cook up
a storm today.

33:07.654 --> 33:09.948
You make the home-made tortillas

33:09.989 --> 33:13.159
and I will do
some really cool salsa.

33:13.201 --> 33:16.830
That will be a way to really up
the ante on this.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.665
I'm once again making a dough,

33:18.707 --> 33:20.208
it's one of my favorite
things to make.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.544
We've compensated
for the extra hot weather

33:22.585 --> 33:24.295
by keeping it wrapped
in a towel,

33:24.337 --> 33:26.965
so that it'll continue to
hydrate and not get dried out.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.967
What're y'all
doing over there?

33:29.009 --> 33:30.927
We're making some homemade
tacos. What about you guys?

33:30.969 --> 33:33.638
We are also making tacos.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.726
We're doing plant based crema
and we're going to do a salsa

33:37.767 --> 33:39.686
and a side salad as well.

33:39.728 --> 33:41.688
You guys home-making
your tacos?

33:41.730 --> 33:43.356
I mean, we're not making
the tortillas,

33:43.398 --> 33:45.025
if that's what you mean.
No.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.068
Milan and Chandrani are
making their own tortillas.

33:47.110 --> 33:50.488
The judges might applaud them
for their ambition,

33:50.530 --> 33:52.198
but they look kind of thick.

33:52.240 --> 33:54.993
I'm happy to stick to
our non homemade tortillas.

33:55.035 --> 33:58.246
I make the salsa Verde at home
and I like cauliflower a lot.

33:58.288 --> 34:00.832
All stuff that I've made before
just never--

34:00.874 --> 34:02.584
-Together.
-Together.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.711
I grow pretty regularly.

34:04.753 --> 34:07.255
It's like proteins,
but it's not plant based.

34:07.297 --> 34:09.424
The hardest part is really
honoring the challenge,

34:09.466 --> 34:12.010
I think we are doing
by grilling the cauliflower,

34:12.052 --> 34:15.472
-the jalapeños, tomatillos.
-You can chop that up

34:15.513 --> 34:18.558
and it'll almost be
like the size of ground beef.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.643
-Yeah.
-45 minutes left!

34:23.313 --> 34:25.523
Make sure they're nice
and roasted.

34:26.608 --> 34:29.736
-How'd the corn turn out, Liz?
-Beautiful. Really grilly.

34:29.778 --> 34:32.280
It is really
hard to roast the cauliflower

34:32.322 --> 34:34.324
because the texture
might be right.

34:34.366 --> 34:36.201
But then you want
to also be cooked.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.828
So there are multiple things
that needs to go right.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.915
This round is more stressful
than the wild card round

34:41.956 --> 34:43.917
because one of us
is definitely going home.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.835
I'm going to start
making the flatbread.

34:45.877 --> 34:47.796
We want to do
a grilled flatbread

34:47.837 --> 34:49.464
and just try
to make it instant.

34:49.506 --> 34:51.132
So, I'm gonna use baking soda.

34:51.174 --> 34:53.259
I think it's going to be
kind of similar to a tortilla,

34:53.301 --> 34:55.261
except it's going
to puff up a little bit.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.931
I'm not going by a recipe.
So hopefully it turns out okay.

34:57.972 --> 34:59.891
I don't think
we will make it so bad

34:59.933 --> 35:02.268
-that we might have to go home.
-Yeah, sure.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.270
It's so sad
that we are in the bottom.

35:04.312 --> 35:06.773
Anika is so disappointed.
What about you, Jack?

35:06.815 --> 35:09.067
I had a little bad hiccup.

35:09.109 --> 35:11.111
My sauce was a little too runny,

35:11.152 --> 35:13.738
but it doesn't mean I can't fix
it and win the next challenge.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.281
Today I'm going to Jack-ify
my dish.

35:15.323 --> 35:17.742
And that means to take
something bland and boring

35:17.784 --> 35:19.744
and turn it
into something amazing.

35:21.996 --> 35:23.957
Yes. And then we're going
to do mushrooms

35:23.998 --> 35:26.626
and we're going to do polenta.

35:26.668 --> 35:28.003
We call it Walk In the Forest

35:28.044 --> 35:29.879
because it reminds
us of autumn.

35:29.921 --> 35:32.007
Polenta at the bottom
is the soil.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.675
Mushrooms are like trees,

35:33.717 --> 35:37.804
and then roasted kale like moss
growing on the mushroom.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.472
Oh, God. that's good.

35:39.514 --> 35:42.434
It's like a harmony,
beautiful plant based dish.

35:42.475 --> 35:45.979
Jack, man, he has big ideas.

35:46.021 --> 35:47.564
See if we can pull this off.

35:47.605 --> 35:49.816
30 minutes!

35:56.239 --> 35:58.199
What are you doing
right there, Mama?

35:58.241 --> 36:00.660
I'm grilling the peaches and
I'm doing balsamic vinegar,

36:00.702 --> 36:04.831
a little bit of fig spread and
putting them on the grill.

36:04.873 --> 36:06.583
All right. You're doing good.

36:06.624 --> 36:09.669
I'm just brushing our oil
herb coulis onto our mushrooms.

36:09.711 --> 36:11.880
It'll give it some flavor.

36:11.921 --> 36:14.549
Okay, let's see
what this flatbread is.

36:14.591 --> 36:16.843
I think it's a little bit crispy

36:16.885 --> 36:19.512
because I put it
on the grill, too long.

36:19.554 --> 36:21.264
Let's taste it.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.478
Everything is tasting good.

36:26.519 --> 36:28.938
I'm really impressed she could
come up with a flatbread

36:28.980 --> 36:31.024
without a recipe.

36:31.066 --> 36:32.901
I came into this competition
that I'm going to be

36:32.942 --> 36:35.862
-the main person doing the work.
-Really?

36:35.904 --> 36:37.822
And she's going
to be helping me.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.282
I didn't know that.

36:39.324 --> 36:42.285
But, here she is
doing the main part,

36:42.327 --> 36:44.287
and I'm just here to support.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.462
This one's done.

36:54.297 --> 36:55.924
What are you guys making today?

36:55.965 --> 36:58.259
We are making a mushroom dish.

36:58.301 --> 37:00.553
It's called
A Walk Through the Forest.

37:00.595 --> 37:03.640
There's green. There's mushroom.

37:03.682 --> 37:05.517
Let's see if we can pull it off.

37:05.558 --> 37:07.102
Sure, sounds good.

37:07.143 --> 37:09.229
All right. I got
the cauliflower chopped up

37:09.270 --> 37:11.398
and we're going to toss this
with like the sauce, too,

37:11.439 --> 37:13.650
which is going to also help
it out a little bit.

37:13.692 --> 37:15.235
Here. Tell me what you think.

37:17.612 --> 37:20.240
-That's good.
-Five minutes left, guys.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.202
-All right, can I do corn salad?
-Mm-hmm.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.830
Jack, watch those little
ones, flip them.

37:26.871 --> 37:29.082
Milan, how are the tacos?
Like seriously.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.960
How long was that sitting there?
Take those out, please.

37:32.002 --> 37:34.546
The tortillas
are a little too thick.

37:34.587 --> 37:37.215
They aren't folding as nicely
as I would have liked.

37:37.257 --> 37:39.175
I mean, that's a really
stressful experience.

37:39.217 --> 37:41.886
One of the four of us left here
is going to go home today.

37:41.928 --> 37:43.388
Go cook the ones
that are ready.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.432
The ones that I got ready?
Okay.

37:45.473 --> 37:46.808
One minute!

37:46.850 --> 37:50.520
-Here we go.
-How's it coming, Jack?

37:51.354 --> 37:53.565
Milan, I have
some more hot ones.

37:54.399 --> 37:56.109
30 seconds.

37:57.610 --> 37:59.112
I just hope that

37:59.154 --> 38:01.406
we can get everything
on the plate.

38:04.743 --> 38:06.786
Just is not plating well.

38:12.667 --> 38:14.419
That did not plate pretty.

38:25.180 --> 38:27.223
-Oh, wow.
-No, they came to play.

38:27.265 --> 38:29.476
Jack and Bobbie.
Please tell us about your dish.

38:29.517 --> 38:31.394
We have A Walk In the Forest.

38:31.436 --> 38:34.689
It is a polenta
with roasted herb mushrooms

38:34.731 --> 38:37.901
with a grilled tomato
vinaigrette with some kale.

38:37.942 --> 38:40.528
The taste is amazing.
The texture is awesome.

38:40.570 --> 38:42.197
It tastes great.

38:42.238 --> 38:43.948
You made me a believer
in big mushrooms.

38:43.990 --> 38:45.533
You played restaurant food.

38:45.575 --> 38:48.411
This could go
into any vegetarian restaurant.

38:48.453 --> 38:50.663
-Good job.
-Thank you.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.751
Anika, tell us about your dish.

38:54.793 --> 38:59.714
So, we made cauliflower steak
with a garbanzo bean curry

38:59.756 --> 39:01.257
and garlic flatbread.

39:01.299 --> 39:03.009
You made that garlic flatbread
by yourself?

39:03.051 --> 39:05.720
Yeah. And we also put some
garlic sauce on the flatbread.

39:05.762 --> 39:08.973
I love cauliflower steak and
I've never had it this way.

39:09.015 --> 39:11.101
You really grilled
the cauliflower

39:11.142 --> 39:12.852
and then you forced us
to learn something

39:12.894 --> 39:15.271
on the rest of the plate
that's about your identity.

39:15.313 --> 39:17.941
I love that. You bring you
and you keep bringing you

39:17.982 --> 39:19.651
-to the party.
-Thank you.

39:21.903 --> 39:24.155
Kaj, can you tell us about
your dish, please?

39:24.197 --> 39:26.616
So we made
grilled cauliflower tacos

39:26.658 --> 39:29.494
with a salsa Verde avocado crema
on the side.

39:29.536 --> 39:32.539
-We have a grilled corn salad.
-It has a lot of flavor,

39:32.580 --> 39:34.749
but I taste the same
thing in the corn

39:34.791 --> 39:37.585
that I taste on my taco.
Did you season it the same?

39:37.627 --> 39:40.213
Yeah, we put the grilled
poblanos and the corn,

39:40.255 --> 39:42.465
and we also had that with
the salsa Verde, too.

39:42.507 --> 39:44.676
So I think that's where
it's overlapping.

39:44.718 --> 39:46.344
Great street tacos.

39:46.386 --> 39:48.138
But is this a little
bit too mushy?

39:48.179 --> 39:49.806
Yeah.

39:49.848 --> 39:52.142
So you needed to grill the
tortillas a little bit more

39:52.183 --> 39:54.144
and allow this to cook through.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.230
Okay, Milan, please tell us what
you made for us.

39:57.272 --> 39:59.941
Today, we have got an elevated
street taco

39:59.983 --> 40:04.696
with a peach salsa alongside
a fried chip hybrid.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.032
This is so good.
It's almost like a dessert.

40:07.073 --> 40:08.491
-Yeah.
-With the peach.

40:08.533 --> 40:10.076
I know.
I love the combination.

40:10.118 --> 40:11.578
Guys, I'm so obsessed with these

40:11.619 --> 40:13.580
that this should be
like a business.

40:13.621 --> 40:15.999
The taco with it was nice
and refreshing.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.501
I didn't love this tortilla.

40:18.543 --> 40:20.420
It felt like it wasn't cooked
all the way.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.672
This is when you know that
she's learning from you guys.

40:22.714 --> 40:25.300
She's becoming a really good
judge, by the way.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.218
It is a little flimsy,
like a little mushy.

40:28.887 --> 40:30.680
Okay, judges, it's time to vote.

40:30.722 --> 40:32.599
Please fill out
the scorecard in front of you.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.226
Who served your least favorite
grilled plate?

40:36.019 --> 40:37.562
I'm a little nervous.

40:37.604 --> 40:39.272
We've always been
in the middle of the pack.

40:39.314 --> 40:41.066
We won immunity
last time.

40:41.107 --> 40:42.609
So, today is the first time

40:42.650 --> 40:44.944
we've really been under pressure
of going home.

40:45.862 --> 40:48.281
I think in the toughest
of circumstances,

40:48.323 --> 40:50.408
you cooked outside
for the first time

40:50.450 --> 40:53.912
and cooking plant based,
no matter what happens,

40:53.953 --> 40:56.414
you can walk out of here
with your head high

40:56.456 --> 40:58.041
and be really proud
of yourself.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.585
The chefs with the
lowest score are.

41:08.593 --> 41:10.220
Kaj and Liz.

41:10.261 --> 41:12.555
Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:14.140 --> 41:16.226
I'm just kind of in disbelief.

41:16.267 --> 41:18.019
I really, really
don't want to go home,

41:18.061 --> 41:19.771
and I know we can
do so much more.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.191
However...

41:24.067 --> 41:26.319
Brooke and Carol,

41:26.361 --> 41:27.946
they'll be leaving
the competition,

41:28.488 --> 41:30.490
and we're going to give you
another chance

41:30.532 --> 41:33.243
to prove yourself
so you won't be going home.

41:36.454 --> 41:39.374
-Wow.
-How do you feel?

41:40.333 --> 41:42.585
It's like a-- it's like
a roller coaster.

41:42.627 --> 41:45.964
We've been the bottom. The top.
We got to get on track now.

41:46.006 --> 41:47.757
You're here now.

41:47.799 --> 41:50.427
You have just as big chance to
win this as everybody else.

41:50.468 --> 41:52.429
And we're all rooting for you.

41:52.470 --> 41:54.556
From here on out I think
it's really important

41:54.597 --> 41:57.434
that we prove to the judges

41:57.475 --> 41:59.519
and everyone else
that we deserve to be here

41:59.561 --> 42:01.312
and we can thrive
in this competition.

42:01.354 --> 42:04.065
Thank you.
Great job, guys.

42:04.441 --> 42:06.317
Oh, my God.
I thought you were gone.

42:13.158 --> 42:15.618
Oh, man, there goes
that tree again.

42:15.660 --> 42:18.455
-No!
-That's a sweet picture.

42:18.496 --> 42:20.248
I didn't even know
you could be 70

42:20.290 --> 42:21.833
and still move like that.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.501
She was running through
the kitchen

42:23.543 --> 42:25.337
picking up
like seven cans at a time.

42:25.378 --> 42:26.963
Don't let my Mama
hear you say that.

42:31.384 --> 42:34.304
When somebody cries, I cry.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.807
Brooke, how are you feeling
health wise?

42:37.849 --> 42:39.809
I'm feeling much better
than I was.

42:39.851 --> 42:42.645
-They said I was overheated.
-Oh, wow.

42:42.687 --> 42:44.731
But I'm going to miss
you all, so much.

42:44.773 --> 42:46.566
We're going to miss you, too.

42:46.608 --> 42:48.610
It really hurt saying
goodbye to everyone.

42:48.651 --> 42:53.198
But honestly, I'm so happy
I even got to be here.

42:53.239 --> 42:56.868
I really see myself going far
in my cooking career.

42:56.910 --> 42:59.954
And I think I could be
on Top Chefwhen I'm older.

42:59.996 --> 43:01.623
Who knows?

43:01.664 --> 43:03.500
You guys are going
to go so far.

43:03.541 --> 43:05.418
I'm so excited to see
what happens to you guys.

43:05.460 --> 43:07.462
We're going to miss everybody.
We really are.

43:07.504 --> 43:10.632
Pushing myself through
this competition,

43:10.674 --> 43:12.676
for Brooke has been a joy.

43:12.717 --> 43:15.679
We'll have this in our memories
for a lifetime.

43:17.013 --> 43:18.723
It's okay.

43:19.891 --> 43:23.561
-Good bye, everybody.
-Bye, everyone!

43:23.603 --> 43:26.940
-We love you!
-Don't stop cooking.

43:28.817 --> 43:31.152
Next, on Top Chef Family Style.

43:31.194 --> 43:32.529
Secret ingredient.

43:32.570 --> 43:34.114
For today's quickfire challenge,

43:34.155 --> 43:37.033
there is one ingredient
that you must all use.

43:37.075 --> 43:40.328
-What?
-What?

43:40.370 --> 43:42.706
Behind. You guys are going down.

43:42.747 --> 43:44.791
Ooh. It's like
a science experiment.

43:44.833 --> 43:48.712
-You gotta take risks.
-Dang. This is dirty.

43:48.753 --> 43:51.256
Chefs, this elimination
challenge,

43:51.297 --> 43:55.051
you must create
an elevated frozen meal.

43:55.093 --> 43:57.762
I started cooking because
I hated frozen meals.

43:57.804 --> 43:59.681
-Well, you hated my cooking.
-Yeah.

43:59.723 --> 44:03.476
-Let's fire up the microwave.
-Move, move!

44:03.518 --> 44:05.103
You know how to do fried rice,
right?

44:05.145 --> 44:06.896
-Duh!
-Got to be kidding.

44:06.938 --> 44:08.732
You're taking too long
on the kebabs.

44:08.773 --> 44:10.734
Today was a really tough day.
