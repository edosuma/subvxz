WEBVTT

00:09.199 --> 00:10.599
Don't do that again.

00:10.679 --> 00:12.720
Tzutz, look.
-What?

00:12.759 --> 00:15.199
Our own apartment, what do you think?
-It's a good apartment.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.039
But you're in love with him!

00:17.120 --> 00:20.719
It's the beginning of your relationship,
before all the shit starts,

00:20.760 --> 00:23.440
why is it so hard to act like
you're in love? -What's going on?

00:23.519 --> 00:26.519
I can make a comment.
-Not in the middle of a technical rehearsal.

00:26.559 --> 00:29.760
Don't yell at me. -Not in the middle
of a technical rehearsal. -Fine.

00:30.039 --> 00:31.120
I can't stand her voice

00:31.160 --> 00:32.320
I can't stand her voice.
-What?

00:32.359 --> 00:34.520
I hate her...
-Then why did you kiss me?

00:34.640 --> 00:37.320
Big mistake! -It was a mistake
I ever met you! -Oh yeah?

00:37.399 --> 00:39.200
I can't work like this!
-Tomer,

00:39.280 --> 00:42.200
don't say things at night
that you'll regret in the morning.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.719
What is this scene?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.320
They killed me?

00:45.359 --> 00:48.479
This is so fucked up.
-I think you're addicted to sex.

00:48.520 --> 00:51.520
What's "addicted to sex"?
-When you can't stop even when you want to.

00:51.560 --> 00:54.119
I'm burning this phone
with all the girls inside.

00:54.159 --> 00:55.200
I don't need them.
Turn the gas on.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.479
No! Ofer!

00:56.520 --> 00:59.759
Dovaleh agreed to come
and save us, so he'll be our director.

01:00.039 --> 01:02.119
Be good and
no hassling him, okay.

01:02.159 --> 01:04.640
Let's see what
you've done so far.

01:19.319 --> 01:20.359
Yes?

01:20.439 --> 01:22.159
Is my daughter here?

01:22.560 --> 01:24.599
Who's your daughter?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.200
My daughter, is she here?

01:29.280 --> 01:30.280
Get dressed and let's go.

01:30.319 --> 01:33.599
I wrote that I was sleeping at Noa's.
-Fine, get dressed.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.719
Come on.
-Is she here?

01:38.120 --> 01:40.519
Yes. Wait in the car,
we'll be right down.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.000
Wait, Dad, I can't find something...

01:43.079 --> 01:45.480
Have you no shame?
-Just find it.

01:45.519 --> 01:47.640
A man your age?
-Avi, wait downstairs.

01:47.719 --> 01:51.280
You think you can have any girl because
you're famous? -Avi, I'm begging you.

01:51.359 --> 01:54.599
I hope someday you find your daughter
with a man like you.

01:54.680 --> 01:59.200
Avi, please wait for us downstairs.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.439
Come on, Gali!

02:02.000 --> 02:03.640
Listen, ma'am...

02:03.719 --> 02:06.319
your daughter is 18.

02:06.359 --> 02:09.039
She's a big girl, what...
-Oh yeah?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.319
She's 18?

03:14.520 --> 03:16.680
Sorry I'm late.
Shall we begin?

03:16.719 --> 03:18.520
Were you offered something to drink?
-Yes.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.439
And you don't want anything?
Water?

03:20.520 --> 03:21.719
No thank you.
-I'm good.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.319
Let me introduce myself,
I'm Avraham Ben-Zaken,

03:24.360 --> 03:27.439
a copyright and
intellectual property lawyer.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.360
Did you read about me?
On Google? -Yes.

03:30.439 --> 03:33.039
Vera Korkin asked me
to help out here,

03:33.120 --> 03:37.199
but I must point out I am not
affiliated with Hamishkan Theatre.

03:37.319 --> 03:41.319
Are both of you comfortable with me
proceeding as your mediator?

03:41.400 --> 03:46.280
Yes. -Yes. -Good. So the matter
at hand is the play 'One and One'.

03:46.319 --> 03:51.319
'One Plus One'.
-Oh, 'One Plus One'. -Yes.

03:51.639 --> 03:53.520
Very nice.

03:53.639 --> 03:56.719
And the aforementioned play,
which is opening on February 29th,

03:56.759 --> 03:59.319
that you supposedly wrote
and you directed

03:59.400 --> 04:04.120
is now under dispute
and you are no longer the director.

04:04.159 --> 04:05.520
Correct?
-Yes.

04:05.639 --> 04:08.680
I didn't 'supposedly' write it,
I wrote it.

04:08.719 --> 04:13.719
Well, since Tomer has threatened
to file an injunction against the play

04:13.759 --> 04:16.040
unless his demands are met...
-Excuse me,

04:16.120 --> 04:19.600
can he do that?
-Please allow me to finish.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.319
In light of the fact
that time is pressing,

04:22.399 --> 04:26.040
I suggest, Tomer, that you list

04:26.120 --> 04:28.199
your demands.

04:28.639 --> 04:31.519
Assuming I'm not directing the play,

04:31.560 --> 04:33.720
and I'm not directing the play,

04:34.079 --> 04:37.360
I think I deserve
half of the writing credit.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.160
Excuse me,
but what does that mean?

04:40.240 --> 04:45.480
It means 50 percent
of anything related to the play,

04:45.519 --> 04:48.319
including royalties and publicity.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.720
Sorry, I need you
to speak in plain language,

04:51.759 --> 04:53.360
you mean that
on the poster

04:53.399 --> 04:57.480
it'd say, 'A play by Iris Schtiebel
and Tomer Lev'?

04:57.519 --> 04:59.199
Yes.
-Correct.

05:00.319 --> 05:03.759
Why should his name be there?
Did you write the play?

05:04.319 --> 05:07.519
I think I had a part in writing it.

05:09.399 --> 05:10.519
Okay, then I have nothing...

05:10.600 --> 05:12.439
One moment.
-I have nothing...

05:12.519 --> 05:13.519
One moment.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.720
It'll only take us back
to the same point tomorrow morning.

05:16.759 --> 05:20.519
Trust me,
I'm talking out of years of experience.

05:24.720 --> 05:25.639
Good. Tomer...

05:25.720 --> 05:27.480
What are you talking about?
You wrote the play?

05:27.519 --> 05:30.720
You don't even know how to type,
you're a one-finger typist.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.279
When did you write the play?

05:33.319 --> 05:35.759
You wrote a play...
-Well,

05:36.399 --> 05:38.680
all the highlighted lines
are mine.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.319
What do you mean, your lines?
-Mine, I said them.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.519
What does that mean?
-Listen and I'll explain. -Well?

05:43.560 --> 05:47.199
Mine, I said them.
or came up with them.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.199
What did you highlight here?

05:54.480 --> 05:56.040
"Why did you say Bar Refaeli?"

05:56.120 --> 05:57.519
"Who did you want me to say,
David Frost?"

05:57.639 --> 06:00.519
I didn't write that?
-But I said it.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.040
In real life.

06:03.199 --> 06:05.439
It's my answer.
-To my question.

06:05.519 --> 06:08.199
One moment,
what do you mean, you said it?

06:08.279 --> 06:10.319
Let's say he did
say that sentence,

06:10.360 --> 06:12.360
is that admissible in court?

06:12.439 --> 06:16.480
If indeed he said it
and you used it professionally,

06:16.519 --> 06:17.720
then yes.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.759
Then anyone could just...
What if

06:20.040 --> 06:22.480
'Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds'
sued the Beatles for...

06:22.519 --> 06:24.720
But Lucy isn't a woman.
-Fine, so not Lucy.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.360
What do you mean,
Lucy isn't a woman?

06:26.399 --> 06:28.040
It's an acronym for LSD.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.519
Fine, then 'Wake Up Little Susie'
by the Everly Brothers, okay?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.519
What if Susie came along
and sued the Everly Brothers?

06:33.560 --> 06:37.319
If there really is someone like that,
then yes, perhaps.

06:37.360 --> 06:40.360
What pretext could Susie possibly cite
for suing the Everly Brothers?

06:40.399 --> 06:43.680
Perhaps she sees herself
as a very alert person

06:44.040 --> 06:47.439
and feels that the lyrics are offensive.
Look,

06:47.519 --> 06:50.680
I'm not claiming that it's rational,
but it is possible.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.319
It is rational.

06:52.399 --> 06:54.040
If she thinks the song
makes her look bad

06:54.120 --> 06:57.120
and no one wants to be in
a relationship with her because of it,

06:57.360 --> 06:59.120
then of course it's rational.

06:59.439 --> 07:01.120
What makes you look bad
in the play?

07:01.160 --> 07:03.040
If someone falls asleep
in the middle of sex,

07:03.120 --> 07:04.360
it doesn't make me
look too great.

07:04.399 --> 07:06.519
Learn how to fuck,
no one'll write anything about you.

07:06.639 --> 07:10.120
Wait, wait,
let's try to have a serious discussion here.

07:10.199 --> 07:12.600
Now look, there are
such legal precedents,

07:12.680 --> 07:15.480
the most famous is
'Simona from Dimona',

07:15.519 --> 07:17.040
I'm sure you know it.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.639
The song 'Simona from Dimona'?
-Yes, we know it. -Good.

07:19.720 --> 07:22.759
"Every day in the hills of Dimona,
she stands there downhearted

07:23.040 --> 07:26.199
"Tan-skinned Simona,
waiting for her man

07:26.319 --> 07:29.360
"Tan-skinned Simona,
waiting for her man."

07:29.439 --> 07:32.360
That Simona from Dimona
had a rough life,

07:32.480 --> 07:34.680
and as fate would have it,
she was divorced, too.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.759
So when the whole country started singing
that she was tan-skinned and waiting,

07:38.040 --> 07:41.680
let's just say that she kept waiting
and waiting and never remarried.

07:41.720 --> 07:45.480
Because of the song? -How many
Simonas do you think there were in Dimona?

07:45.519 --> 07:47.639
So everyone knew it was her.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.480
I don't understand
what we're talking about.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.519
I'm sorry, I don't...

07:51.600 --> 07:54.319
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

07:54.519 --> 07:55.519
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.639
Let's say I don't want to share
the credit with him,

07:57.720 --> 07:59.720
is he going to stop the play?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.439
Really?
You will stop the play?

08:01.519 --> 08:03.439
You can do the play,
just without all the highlighted lines.

08:03.519 --> 08:06.160
I'm the one who got you
into a repertory theater!

08:06.240 --> 08:09.720
You were doing weird fringe plays
with pigeons where I was handing out

08:09.759 --> 08:12.519
fliers outside to the four people who came.
-You wouldn't have taken the play

08:12.600 --> 08:15.160
out of the drawer
if I hadn't submitted it to the theater,

08:15.240 --> 08:16.160
don't you understand that?

08:16.240 --> 08:19.120
You would have read your
plays to me in the living room.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.120
Excuse me,
were you a couple?

08:22.319 --> 08:23.439
Yes.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.199
For how long?

08:25.319 --> 08:27.639
A few years.
-You don't know how many years?

08:28.079 --> 08:29.199
One second,

08:29.319 --> 08:32.679
and you broke up after
the play was written? -Yes.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.759
By whose initiative?
-His, completely.

08:35.039 --> 08:38.120
Is it possible that
you resent him for that?

08:38.159 --> 08:41.360
Perhaps that is where
the fight originated?

08:41.519 --> 08:43.480
I don't understand,
is this couple's therapy?

08:43.519 --> 08:45.320
Is there a reason
why you're in his favor?

08:45.399 --> 08:48.759
I'm not in anyone's favor.
-Fine, so...

08:49.039 --> 08:50.720
If I resent him for leaving me?

08:50.759 --> 08:53.360
Of course I do, so what?

08:53.519 --> 08:55.759
What's this? "Tzutz, I love you,"
"I love you too..."

08:56.039 --> 08:58.320
Fuck that!
You said that?

08:58.399 --> 08:59.480
You said it?

08:59.519 --> 09:02.519
Excuse me, Mr. Attorney,
he marked a sentence here,

09:02.600 --> 09:05.320
"Tzutz, I love you,"
"I love you too."

09:05.360 --> 09:07.039
He never said "I love you."

09:07.120 --> 09:09.320
He doesn't say the full sentence,
he either says "Me too"

09:09.399 --> 09:10.519
or "thank you"

09:10.559 --> 09:11.360
on a good day.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.360
Look, intellectual property
is not a black and white issue.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.519
Do you really believe this?

09:17.679 --> 09:21.200
Do you really believe
that this play is half yours?

09:23.120 --> 09:24.000
No, it's not half mine,

09:24.080 --> 09:26.000
but I'm half of the play.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.120
Can you imagine this play
without me?

09:32.200 --> 09:34.000
Can you imagine
this production happening

09:34.080 --> 09:37.200
and me not having
anything to do with it?

09:38.720 --> 09:41.200
Is that what you really want?

09:44.679 --> 09:46.480
Nothing that has happened
these past few months

09:46.519 --> 09:49.039
is what I really want.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.000
One moment.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.200
One moment, it's such a shame.
-I'm sorry.

09:53.320 --> 09:57.159
Sorry for your trouble.
-That's it?

10:06.519 --> 10:08.200
Dovaleh.

10:08.279 --> 10:11.440
Before we continue...
-Yes?

10:11.519 --> 10:15.039
I want you to know that I got
my college degree in theater directing,

10:15.120 --> 10:19.159
so I have lots of direct--
direction--

10:19.240 --> 10:23.200
Directorial. -Directorial aspirations.
-Wonderful!

10:23.320 --> 10:26.159
Good. -So if you'd like
to share your ideas with me,

10:26.240 --> 10:28.039
I'd love to learn from you.

10:28.120 --> 10:31.279
Wonderful, that's just wonderful.
-Thank you.

10:31.320 --> 10:35.679
Okay, go ahead.
-From "It's late"? -Yes.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.720
Go ahead.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.200
It's late.
-What?

10:43.720 --> 10:45.480
My period.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.279
I see.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.159
Problem.
-Major.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.000
Does that ever happen?

11:00.240 --> 11:02.480
How's it going?
-Is it regular?

11:02.519 --> 11:04.679
He'll have this play on its feet in one day.
-Clockwork.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.039
Three days and he could finish
an opera by Puccini.

11:08.120 --> 11:12.000
But is it working?
-Listen, he's a contract worker.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.519
He works without heart,
but sometimes that's what you need.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.159
Swiss?

11:16.720 --> 11:18.320
Brand new.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.320
How were the peace talks?

11:23.759 --> 11:27.200
Not good, we made no progress.
-Why, what does he want?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.320
Half the credit for the play.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.159
You don't have a contract with him?
-No.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.679
Why didn't you sign a contract?

11:35.759 --> 11:38.519
We were a couple, Vera.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.120
You listen to me,
there's no such thing as 'couple'!

11:42.200 --> 11:45.360
From now on, sign a contract for
every fart you make.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.720
When I was young,
I also thought 'couple'.

11:47.759 --> 11:50.600
I've just finished paying for the shit I got
stuck with because of 'couple'.

11:50.679 --> 11:52.120
Vera.

11:52.159 --> 11:56.720
Sweetie, you're disturbing me, please.
-Sorry.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.120
Excuse me a second.
Iris?

11:59.200 --> 12:02.320
What happened?
Is he serious about the injunction?

12:02.399 --> 12:04.639
Yes, it turns out that he is.

12:04.720 --> 12:07.440
So we could be
rehearsing for nothing?

12:07.600 --> 12:11.120
Mayachka, I pay you to act, right?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.519
So you act
and I'll manage things, okay?

12:13.639 --> 12:15.039
Thanks, get back to work.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.440
Since we've already stopped,

12:17.720 --> 12:22.039
I want you to listen, friends,
this text has a tempo.

12:22.120 --> 12:26.120
It has a rhythm to it.
Line-line, line-line.

12:28.279 --> 12:31.120
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm,
rhythm, rhythm.

12:31.159 --> 12:33.200
It flows, but you keep pausing.
What for?

12:33.320 --> 12:35.480
This isn't Chekhov,
it's not psychologically complex.

12:35.519 --> 12:39.200
Go with the flow, enjoy yourselves.
Okay.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.200
Seriously.

12:42.279 --> 12:43.720
It's late.
-What?

12:43.759 --> 12:45.360
My period.
-I see.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.639
Problem.
-Major.

12:46.720 --> 12:48.200
Does that ever happen?
-No.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.519
It's regular?
-Clockwork.

12:49.639 --> 12:51.200
That character

12:51.279 --> 12:52.519
is not Tomer.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.440
It's who I'd want him to be.

12:55.519 --> 12:58.039
If I wrote the scenes like they
really happened in our life,

12:58.120 --> 12:59.679
you know what I would've written?
-What?

12:59.720 --> 13:01.440
Silences.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.759
Me talking and him not replying.

13:04.039 --> 13:05.519
Not a single word.

13:05.559 --> 13:07.759
I wouldn't raise an eggplant
with you either, how's that?

13:08.039 --> 13:09.039
Good!

13:09.120 --> 13:11.320
Good, good!

13:11.360 --> 13:13.759
Okay, from the top.
I'm late, I'm late.

13:14.039 --> 13:16.039
What is it you say?
-"It's late."

13:16.159 --> 13:17.519
It's late.
-What?

13:17.559 --> 13:19.519
My period.
-I see.

13:19.639 --> 13:21.600
Give in to him.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.480
What? Why?

13:23.519 --> 13:28.279
Because you have a future in theater,
his story is over.

13:28.399 --> 13:30.519
Think of him as
a springboard for you,

13:30.559 --> 13:35.120
give him what he wants,
then jump right over his head, understand?

13:35.159 --> 13:38.000
I feel guilty, if that helps.

13:43.159 --> 13:45.200
I have nothing more to say...

13:45.320 --> 13:48.360
I'm sorry that you guys
are stuck in the middle of all this.

13:48.399 --> 13:50.039
Tomer, come on,

13:50.120 --> 13:52.159
after all the work we put in?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.200
We're rehearsing
for a production

13:54.279 --> 13:55.759
that may not even happen?
It's stupid.

13:56.039 --> 13:57.600
I hope it won't
come to that, okay?

13:57.679 --> 13:59.039
I...

13:59.120 --> 14:00.320
I understand your situation,

14:00.360 --> 14:05.120
that's why I agreed to meet you.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.639
Don't you have anything to say?
Didn't you invite anyone to the premiere?

14:10.720 --> 14:12.320
You don't care?

14:12.360 --> 14:14.360
I say you should come back.
-He can't.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.759
Why not?
I'll talk to Vera.

14:16.039 --> 14:18.120
Ofer, Ofer, thanks, but...

14:18.200 --> 14:19.720
it's too complicated.
-Want me to leave?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.360
What? -They can replace me,
why you?

14:21.399 --> 14:23.200
Ofer, what are you talking about?
-She's already got Dovaleh,

14:23.320 --> 14:26.120
she'll never take him back. -Yeah,
it's always me who fucks everything up.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.279
I don't want to come back,
guys, so just stop it.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.720
It has nothing to do with you

14:30.759 --> 14:34.720
or to what happened
with Iris, okay?

14:36.120 --> 14:38.440
So how's it going with...

14:39.519 --> 14:42.320
the new director?

14:42.759 --> 14:44.440
It's okay.

14:44.639 --> 14:48.200
What did you work on today?
-We went over everything.

14:48.279 --> 14:49.200
Really?
-Almost.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.519
Until the end of "late period."
-Wow.

14:52.559 --> 14:56.679
And it feels okay?
The scene works? -Yeah.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.639
All right.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.039
Can we get the check please?
-It's okay, it's on me.

15:01.120 --> 15:02.440
It's on me.
-Come on.

15:02.519 --> 15:04.279
No way.
-No, it's on me.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.519
No way, forget it.
Where is she?

15:11.039 --> 15:13.039
Do you feel like showing me
what you did?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.320
The dialogue?
-Here?

15:14.360 --> 15:15.200
If you feel like it,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.200
just the banter.

15:17.279 --> 15:18.720
Okay.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.639
Let's show him.

15:20.759 --> 15:22.639
From "It's late."

15:27.600 --> 15:30.159
It's late.
-What? -My period.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.279
I see.

15:31.519 --> 15:33.360
Problem.
-Major.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.519
Does that ever happen?
-No.

15:35.559 --> 15:37.519
It's regular?
-Clockwork.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.039
Swiss?
-Brand new.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.440
Wait, why are you doing it
like that?

15:41.519 --> 15:44.320
What? -Why so fast?
You're not...

15:44.360 --> 15:46.720
listening to each other,
why so fast?

15:47.000 --> 15:49.279
He said the scene
has a certain temperature.

15:49.320 --> 15:51.480
Temperature. -Fine, Temperature.

15:51.519 --> 15:53.440
Like ping-pong.
-Okay,

15:53.519 --> 15:56.120
but why ping-pong?

15:56.200 --> 15:57.720
Do you know
she's about to say

15:58.000 --> 16:00.720
that her period is late?
Why so fast?

16:00.759 --> 16:02.120
Exactly.

16:02.159 --> 16:04.039
Do it again.

16:04.120 --> 16:09.200
Anyone else want to direct this scene?
-Let him. Direct.

16:09.759 --> 16:11.720
Look.

16:13.519 --> 16:15.320
It's late.

16:15.759 --> 16:16.720
What?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.279
One sec.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.159
You're afraid to tell him, right?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.279
Okay, wait a minute.

16:23.559 --> 16:25.360
Now answer.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.039
My period.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.200
Problem.

16:30.519 --> 16:32.360
You're scared to death.
What have I done?

16:32.399 --> 16:34.279
Did or didn't I wear a condom?

16:34.320 --> 16:37.039
Is she on the pill?
Am I gonna be a father?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.480
Text.

16:39.519 --> 16:43.519
I see. Problem.
-Right.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.519
Major.
-Right.

16:45.559 --> 16:48.320
What do we do?
Could there be an escape route?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.759
Does that ever happen?

16:51.279 --> 16:52.279
No.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.720
No escape, no nothing.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.039
It's regular?

16:57.159 --> 16:58.200
Clockwork.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.320
Swiss?

16:59.360 --> 17:00.720
Brand new.

17:01.519 --> 17:03.440
That's it, your life is over.

17:03.519 --> 17:05.359
Conclusion?

17:08.279 --> 17:10.200
I see.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.519
Isn't that better?

17:15.559 --> 17:17.720
Isn't that nicer?

17:18.319 --> 17:19.200
Better?

17:19.319 --> 17:20.720
He said the pauses
make it too heavy.

17:20.759 --> 17:23.160
Who cares what he says?

17:24.559 --> 17:29.000
Could be. Could be.

17:29.599 --> 17:32.319
Do as he says,
he's the director.

18:02.319 --> 18:05.720
You're awesome in 'Love Under Fire'.
Awesome.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.319
Can we start?
-From the top, please.

18:18.160 --> 18:21.480
If we could only turn back

18:21.519 --> 18:25.440
The hands of time

18:25.559 --> 18:28.519
What a wonderful world

18:28.640 --> 18:32.160
He would have built

18:32.240 --> 18:36.759
If we could only turn back

18:37.119 --> 18:39.119
The clock...

18:39.240 --> 18:40.359
I asked her
how old she was.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.319
I always ask.

18:43.640 --> 18:46.319
Am I supposed to ask
for ID from now on?

18:46.359 --> 18:49.279
Huh, Shlomo?
Do you ask to see ID?

18:49.319 --> 18:51.640
Ofer...
-Can she press charges?

18:52.079 --> 18:54.640
She said she was 18.
Can she press charges?

18:54.720 --> 18:57.039
Listen...
-Could she actually

18:57.119 --> 18:59.119
press charges against me?
Because...

18:59.160 --> 19:00.519
I'm scared to death.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.119
Ofer...
-If she told me

19:02.200 --> 19:05.119
that she was 18,
can she press charges

19:05.160 --> 19:06.480
against me?
-Ofer...

19:06.519 --> 19:09.119
But she told me she was 18, so...

19:09.160 --> 19:11.519
Ofer, Ofer.
-I don't know what to do.

19:11.559 --> 19:13.680
You should've seen
how her father looked at me,

19:13.759 --> 19:18.319
you should've seen the look
on his face, I wanted...

19:19.279 --> 19:21.440
to bury myself.
-Listen to me,

19:21.519 --> 19:23.599
if I ask you to come with me
somewhere today, will you come?

19:23.680 --> 19:27.599
I'll do whatever you say.
-Yeah? -I don't know what to do.

19:27.759 --> 19:30.519
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.319
It's okay.

19:42.359 --> 19:45.640
Now grab my hands over my head.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.319
Like this?

19:51.240 --> 19:54.200
Yes, but with one of your hands.

19:56.039 --> 19:59.000
This hard?
-Harder.

19:59.119 --> 20:02.039
Harder?
-Yes, so that

20:02.119 --> 20:04.119
I won't be able to move
and I'll be scared.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.000
Like this?
-Yes, and...

20:07.079 --> 20:10.640
strangle me a little
with your other hand.

20:12.160 --> 20:15.119
Like this?
-Harder.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.519
Harder. Harder.

20:19.160 --> 20:20.640
Yes.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.359
Does it bug you that I'm talking?
-Very much.

20:23.519 --> 20:25.720
Can you shut up?
I think I got the picture.

20:25.759 --> 20:27.000
What did you get?

20:27.079 --> 20:29.039
I got it.

20:34.279 --> 20:35.519
What?
-No, I said it was good,

20:35.559 --> 20:37.359
don't let me talk,
I don't want to dominate the...

20:41.079 --> 20:42.759
No talking.

20:45.240 --> 20:47.160
Understood?

20:49.400 --> 20:53.519
If I take my hand away
will you be able to shut up?

21:02.599 --> 21:06.640
You are so fucking beautiful.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.279
Ignore it.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.480
It's Reut, answer.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.319
What, Buddha?

21:28.759 --> 21:31.480
At rehearsal,
I'm almost done.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.440
Really? How close?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.119
No, don't come in,
there's no point.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.359
I'll be right out,
I'll meet you outside.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.119
Okay, Buddha.

21:45.319 --> 21:46.759
Bye.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.359
See? If you hadn't
told me to answer,

21:50.400 --> 21:52.359
this never would've happened.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.319
Now I'm going to punish you
for shortening our time.

21:55.359 --> 21:56.359
Wait, I don't...

21:56.480 --> 21:59.039
Shut up, no talking.

21:59.599 --> 22:03.319
Let's see what I can do to you
in 15 minutes.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.519
You like being strangled?

22:10.480 --> 22:13.119
Are you crying?

22:13.359 --> 22:14.599
How will we tell him?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.359
No, he didn't hear us, Yuvi.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.359
God help me,
how will we tell him?

22:18.480 --> 22:19.640
We won't tell him,

22:19.720 --> 22:21.359
why would we tell him?

22:21.480 --> 22:24.359
It'll break his heart,
he'll never speak to us again.

22:26.519 --> 22:30.119
Yuvi, I'll never leave Reut.

22:30.440 --> 22:32.119
I just married him.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.680
Then I'll get a big part
in the theater,

22:33.720 --> 22:36.759
then I'll have a baby with him,
you see?

22:37.319 --> 22:39.359
Then what do you want from me?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.720
You're my lover.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.200
You are so fucked-up,
you're totally fucked-up.

22:55.319 --> 22:58.440
Wait, Yuvi,
I didn't mean it like that.

22:58.519 --> 22:59.720
I don't care.

23:00.039 --> 23:03.119
I meant that with you
it's something else.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.319
Why do we have to tell him?

23:06.400 --> 23:09.119
So that he'll leave me
and you and I will be together

23:09.200 --> 23:12.000
and we'll buy a couch and a TV
and all that shit? Is that what you want?

23:12.079 --> 23:13.319
I don't want anything
from you anymore.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.519
Who do you think you are?

23:14.640 --> 23:16.279
Why did you come on to me,

23:16.319 --> 23:18.160
When i'm about to marry your
best friend?

23:18.240 --> 23:19.720
I'm done here, Your Highness,

23:19.759 --> 23:21.319
you can go to hell.

23:21.359 --> 23:23.599
Wait, Yuvi, wait.

23:24.200 --> 23:25.519
Wait.

23:25.559 --> 23:27.480
Wait, Yuvi.

23:30.079 --> 23:33.200
It's not only that.
You...

23:34.359 --> 23:37.039
You bring out...

23:39.519 --> 23:41.759
I feel...
-What?

23:44.440 --> 23:46.640
What do you feel?

23:51.400 --> 23:54.599
That I'll be a better actress
thanks to you.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.359
You're an idiot.

24:06.160 --> 24:10.039
I love you, I don't care
what kind of actress you'll be.

24:10.400 --> 24:15.599
I'm such an idiot...

24:36.519 --> 24:37.640
My name is Aryeh

24:37.720 --> 24:41.000
and I'm addicted to
hard relationships.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.319
Cheating and objectifying women,

24:43.359 --> 24:46.000
as well as prostitutes,

24:46.160 --> 24:47.359
chats,

24:47.400 --> 24:52.640
sending and receiving sexual pictures,
porn, compulsive masturbation,

24:52.759 --> 24:54.720
and I'm not clean.

24:55.039 --> 24:57.319
We love you, Aryeh.

24:57.519 --> 25:01.039
Amit. Addicted.
Clean, two weeks.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.519
We love you, Amit.

25:04.480 --> 25:09.200
I'm very grateful for this program
and Almighty God,

25:09.319 --> 25:12.039
I've been clean for
six months and one week.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.119
We love you.

25:15.039 --> 25:18.160
I'm Asaf and I'm a sex addict.
That's it.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.359
We love you, Asaf.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.359
Me?

25:27.519 --> 25:29.319
I'm Ofer,

25:29.559 --> 25:31.359
I...

25:35.559 --> 25:37.319
Well, I...

25:37.400 --> 25:40.000
What can I say?

25:40.440 --> 25:44.359
I'm not too sure
I belong here.

25:44.440 --> 25:47.359
Not in a bad way, I...

25:47.400 --> 25:51.000
I don't want to offend anyone.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.359
I...

25:54.480 --> 25:59.279
fool around with lots of girls,
a player.

25:59.319 --> 26:02.319
But I don't think
it's something that's...

26:02.440 --> 26:05.039
out of the ordinary.

26:06.119 --> 26:11.359
I'm also an actor, for those of you
who recognize me. Never mind.

26:13.319 --> 26:16.480
I got into a little trouble recently

26:16.519 --> 26:20.359
for sending some messages
here and there, but...

26:20.519 --> 26:23.680
not anything unusual.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.200
Facebook, Instagram and stuff.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.440
Maybe I went a little too far.

26:35.319 --> 26:37.119
I nearly got married, too,

26:37.200 --> 26:40.480
I was engaged
two years ago, so...

26:40.720 --> 26:44.279
I don't think
I have a problem with...

26:46.440 --> 26:49.319
What was I gonna say?
I...

26:49.359 --> 26:52.200
I've lost my train of thought.

26:52.640 --> 26:56.519
Oh, and porn, I...

26:56.759 --> 27:01.680
I watch it like everyone else,
you know.

27:03.519 --> 27:06.359
I also went to a prostitute,
out of nowhere,

27:06.480 --> 27:08.720
a month ago.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.200
Maybe I am a little lost, but...

27:14.720 --> 27:17.000
I don't know.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.640
What?

27:21.319 --> 27:22.759
That's it.

27:23.519 --> 27:26.519
We love you, Ofer.

27:30.680 --> 27:34.480
My name is Ronen,
I'm a sex addict.

27:43.559 --> 27:46.640
Excuse me.
-So sorry.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.359
I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

27:50.240 --> 27:54.039
You scared me. -I'm sorry.
-No, no, it's okay.

27:54.119 --> 27:56.640
Were you waiting for me?
-Yes, I'm...

27:56.720 --> 27:59.440
I'm Tomer. I...
-Oh... -Did the play, before...

27:59.519 --> 28:02.119
That's right. Hello, Tomer.
-Yes.

28:02.160 --> 28:04.000
Come on in.
-No, it's okay.

28:04.079 --> 28:06.640
Thank you, but...

28:06.759 --> 28:08.720
Okay.
-But there's no need.

28:08.759 --> 28:11.440
This is the copy of the play
that I worked with,

28:11.519 --> 28:14.359
it has all my comments
and edits on it.

28:14.400 --> 28:20.720
I wrote on the back all the things
that I think are crucial.

28:21.039 --> 28:24.000
I think you'll be able
to read my handwriting.

28:24.079 --> 28:27.519
For example,
in scene 2 with the beard,

28:27.559 --> 28:30.359
when she says she has a mustache,
you know that part? -Yes.

28:30.480 --> 28:33.160
it used she has a beard
and we changed it.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.200
Iris insisted on the beard

28:36.319 --> 28:37.480
and I think she was right.

28:37.519 --> 28:39.359
Oh, she was right?
-So maybe...

28:39.480 --> 28:43.200
That's just an example,
go over it and...

28:43.680 --> 28:47.200
All right. -I don't want to interfere
in your work. -No, no...

28:47.319 --> 28:48.200
It's yours

28:48.319 --> 28:51.160
and I'm sure you don't need my help.
-Yes.

28:51.240 --> 28:55.759
I just wanted to give you
my input and... -Yes.

28:56.119 --> 28:57.759
Thank you.
-No problem.

28:58.039 --> 28:59.759
Oh, scene 7,

29:00.519 --> 29:02.519
when her period is late,
there's a dialogue...

29:02.640 --> 29:05.200
Oh, where it's one word
back and forth. -Exactly.

29:05.319 --> 29:07.440
I know it seems like it should
be a quick banter,

29:07.519 --> 29:09.519
fast, because it's comedy.
-Yes.

29:09.599 --> 29:12.519
I actually think you should...

29:13.599 --> 29:16.359
Yes?
-Approach it

29:16.400 --> 29:19.200
as a drama.
Not too heavy,

29:19.279 --> 29:22.119
but they should listen
to each other before talking.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.119
You mean, pauses?
I don't...

29:24.200 --> 29:25.119
I don't know.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.599
I think the pauses
will make the scene

29:28.680 --> 29:30.680
too heavy.
-That's just my opinion.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.000
Okay.
-That's it.

29:33.519 --> 29:36.200
You understand.
-Listen,

29:37.559 --> 29:40.200
why don't you come back
to direct it?

29:40.359 --> 29:42.119
Okay, I'm sorry, it's yours.
-Seriously.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.519
I'm sorry.
-Tomer,

29:43.599 --> 29:46.119
we're just talking, no problem

29:46.200 --> 29:49.519
I think it's a very sweet play,

29:49.599 --> 29:53.519
it has potential,
and it could do very well.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.359
I'm just doing Vera a favor,

29:57.480 --> 30:01.359
for the play I directed before this one,
that didn't even cover its expenses.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.680
I think you should direct it.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
I think it's your rhythm,

30:07.079 --> 30:10.319
I really and truly think so.
Really.

30:10.359 --> 30:13.119
I can feel it, it's you.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.480
What do you say?

30:14.559 --> 30:16.519
I'll talk to Vera.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.519
No, don't talk to her.

30:18.599 --> 30:20.519
Why not?

30:20.559 --> 30:22.720
No, it's...

30:23.000 --> 30:24.519
What?

30:25.079 --> 30:28.119
It's just too complicated.

30:28.359 --> 30:31.359
What a shame.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.720
But thanks.

30:34.720 --> 30:36.519
Okay, so...

30:36.640 --> 30:38.279
Here you go.
-Thank you.

30:38.319 --> 30:40.119
Thank you.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.359
Tomer,

30:47.279 --> 30:50.160
I'm keeping the pajamas.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.160
Bye.
