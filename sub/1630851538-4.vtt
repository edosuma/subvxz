00:17.267 --> 00:20.353
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.772
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.942
You think fairy tales are cute,
and pink, and full of fairies.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.448
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.491 --> 00:37.037
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.538
-A scary tale.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.373
-A strange tale.

00:41.374 --> 00:42.667
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:47.297
-You really think you can handle it?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.596
Once upon a time,

00:54.679 --> 00:58.141
a young girl found herself
alone in the woods.

00:58.641 --> 01:01.311
-The brother she loved was dead.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.813
Now, for the first time in her life,

01:03.897 --> 01:07.150
-she didn't have a plan… or hope.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.172
I've been searching for you
for so long, Gretel.

01:30.131 --> 01:32.884
How… how do you know my name?

01:33.468 --> 01:35.303
-I know much about--

01:35.386 --> 01:36.888
Get a move on, little guppy.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.015
-I got ya covered.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.811
Gretel! Wait! I just want to-- Ooph!

01:46.773 --> 01:47.899
Let's go!

01:56.825 --> 01:58.159
-Geez.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.706
Oh, hey there. I'm Widow Fischer.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.376
It's kinda on the nose,
but what can ya do?

02:06.459 --> 02:08.253
Fish is me business.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.632
Fish, but nothing fishy,
that's what I always say.

02:12.715 --> 02:16.136
Well, sometimes I say it's good for trout,
it's good for a salmon.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.597
Or I say, you know, whatever
the next thing I'm gonna say is.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.641
It could be anything. Oh, hang on.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.768
Oh, I feel it coming. Here it comes!

02:23.852 --> 02:26.187
Oh, any second. It's coming! I can't wait…

02:26.271 --> 02:27.230
Pickle!

02:29.399 --> 02:31.985
Psst! It was pickle.

02:34.612 --> 02:38.408
So how come you ain't talking anyway?
Somebody sew up your mouth?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.618
I'm… sad.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.036
-Oh.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.790
You can call me Edith.

02:46.624 --> 02:47.458
Gretel.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.169
Gretel.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.921
-That was me father's name.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.259
Oh, man, those fish look good.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.888
Let 'em get stinky for a couple weeks
and we're having ourselves a party--

02:59.971 --> 03:01.181
Shh. Shush!

03:01.264 --> 03:03.975
Ahem. Yes, Gretel was devastated.

03:04.058 --> 03:07.854
But if she had known what was
about to happen just a few miles away…

03:10.398 --> 03:12.275
…she would have wept with joy.

03:12.942 --> 03:17.155
Oh, no, no.
Thank you. Thank you.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.115
It was a perilous hunt.

03:19.199 --> 03:23.369
-But I, Lord Meister, slayed the beast.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.871
No need to cheer.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.502
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:41.554 --> 03:45.016
Yes. Yeah.
Thank you. Thank-- Yes, yes, it is I.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.776
Your tea, Lord Meister.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.530
It is58.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.659
-Tea time is at00.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.494
That is a rule.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.831
Without rules my perfect fiefdom
would descend into anarchy!

04:08.915 --> 04:11.125
Into madness!

04:11.209 --> 04:14.587
I've a good mind
to dash that cup to bits against the wall!

04:14.671 --> 04:20.260
But since the rules state that a lord
must always maintain his composure,

04:20.343 --> 04:22.637
throw the cup for me, Shillingworth.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.555
Throw it roughly.

04:27.558 --> 04:31.521
I'm sorry you all had to see me
lose my temper like that.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.023
-Now, clean up the mess, Shillingworth.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.818
Slowly, and while grumbling incoherently.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.075
Excellent!

04:44.158 --> 04:46.619
Time to prepare the beast-skin rug.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.003
No, no, no, no! Don't show the guts!

04:55.086 --> 04:58.423
Show me the guts, baby! Show me the guts!

05:08.182 --> 05:09.392
Gretel.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.770
Wait a minute. That guy was dead!

05:12.854 --> 05:14.480
That's not how dying works.

05:14.564 --> 05:19.152
Half the stuff I eat is dead.
Is it gonna come back to life in my belly?

05:19.235 --> 05:21.487
Will it claw its way out?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.281
-Okay.

05:23.865 --> 05:28.161
At the same time, Gretel was arriving
at a strange building just down the road.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.209
This is me shop.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.715
I been running this place all alone

05:40.798 --> 05:45.219
since the late Mr. Fischer took up
the ill-advised sport of spear catching.

05:45.928 --> 05:48.973
I could really use me a hand.
I got a spare room.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.725
Wanna help me out? Hmm?

05:50.808 --> 05:54.437
I could give you all the fish
you could choke down. Come on.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.980
Whaddya say?

05:56.064 --> 05:57.065
Well, I…

05:58.441 --> 06:01.527
I haven't had the best of luck
with parents.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.739
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I ain't gon' be your parent.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.116
I'm just gon' be a grown-up
who takes care of ya.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.452
-Tells ya what to do.
-That's what a parent--

06:09.535 --> 06:12.663
No, come on. You're way overthinking this.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.665
Ya gotta stop listening
to your head-brain.

06:14.749 --> 06:17.126
Ya gotta start listening
to your chest-brain, right?

06:17.210 --> 06:20.213
Oh, wait, what's that thing called?
It's called, uh…

06:20.296 --> 06:22.840
Is it your heart? Heart?
Am I saying that right?

06:22.924 --> 06:24.675
Is it your hoooort?

06:27.804 --> 06:28.638
All right.

06:29.222 --> 06:33.393
Well, then, welcome to your new home.

06:47.365 --> 06:52.954
Shillingworth, this beast-boy
has altogether too much blood on him.

06:53.037 --> 06:54.705
Tidy him up at once.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.709
-You can't tidy a beast-boy with a whisk.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.629
He requires a lordly cleaning.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.923
Yes, my lord.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.883
The grand deluxe.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.978
-Oh?

07:19.063 --> 07:20.189
Hmm.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.359
What manner of beast are you?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.111
A…

07:25.820 --> 07:27.071
A bad one.

07:28.072 --> 07:31.451
You don't seem bad to me.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.203
You seem like rather a nice chap.

07:35.913 --> 07:39.834
When a lord speaks, you answer.
That's a rule.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.504
-My name is Hansel.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.590
I'm a boy who turned into a beast.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.426
I did something bad.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.974
-Well, since I caught you,

07:55.057 --> 07:56.726
beast or boy, you're mine.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.811
And nothing of mine is ever bad.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.938
Everything of mine is good.

08:01.022 --> 08:04.025
Because in my castle, we follow the rules.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.403
-Do you want to be good?

08:08.321 --> 08:09.614
Yes, please.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.591
As he settled into his new home,

08:28.674 --> 08:31.511
-Hansel could think only of Gretel.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.889
He knew in his little heart
that Gretel could never,

08:34.972 --> 08:37.725
-ever forgive him for almost killing her.

08:38.309 --> 08:44.190
And that it would be better for her
if she never, ever saw him again.

08:45.399 --> 08:48.736
Not far away,
Gretel could think only of Hansel.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.324
She knew that he had
sacrificed himself to save her.

08:53.407 --> 08:58.162
And for all of her thinking and planning,
Gretel knew in her little heart

08:58.246 --> 09:02.500
that she would never,
ever see Hansel again.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.253
This is sad, so sad.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.173
I just ate the last fish.

09:10.174 --> 09:13.302
-But you should know that with time,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.179
sadness starts to fade.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.476
We've got 20 jars of preserved fish,
ten fish pies, 14 bags of powdered fish--

09:20.560 --> 09:22.103
"Fourteen bags of powdered fish…"

09:22.186 --> 09:25.815
I told ya, ya don't got to take stock
every five minutes.

09:25.898 --> 09:29.277
Uh… Sorry, I like to be organized.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.029
Bees is organized, but they ain't happy.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.657
Oh, wait. I don't know,
are they happy or not?

09:34.740 --> 09:36.242
I don't knows.

09:36.325 --> 09:39.370
The point is,
you gotta loosen up.

09:53.050 --> 09:55.636
Good morning, ladies.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

09:56.721 --> 09:59.015
I'm a widow! I-- I mean, um, yes.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.350
Day is, uh, beau-- beautiful. Yes.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.437
I'm having a fish fry
for poor children of the village. I need--

10:04.520 --> 10:05.563
Fish!

10:05.646 --> 10:09.609
Yes. And lots of them. I'm having
such trouble finding pickled herring.

10:13.696 --> 10:14.572
Uh…

10:14.655 --> 10:17.283
Well, you've come to the right place.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.536
We've got pickled herring.
I'll get it for you.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.704
I'm Gretel.

10:21.787 --> 10:22.997
Hello, Gretel.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.169
Uh… do you need any help?

10:28.252 --> 10:30.212
No, no. I've got it.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.887
It's a good thing I was here
'cause, uh, you could have been hurt.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.098
Eh, I've fallen
from castles, cliffs, trees.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.516
A ladder is nothing.

10:42.600 --> 10:45.603
Yeah, it does look like
you've seen some hard times.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.482
You don't have to hide who you are.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.777
If you've lived through a lot,
it just means you've really lived.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.528
You should be proud of that.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.285
-I'm a widow!
-Yes, you mentioned.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.621
Also, we've met many times, Widow Fischer.

11:03.704 --> 11:07.249
Anyhoo, here's some free fish
for the poor children.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.709
Uh, thank you, miss.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.503
"Miss."

11:10.586 --> 11:14.507
Those poor children will be so grateful.
I'm glad to be able to do something nice.

11:14.590 --> 11:18.302
It's nice… uh, uh, to be nice.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.181
It is indeed.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.433
-Good day, ladies.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.484
-And today, we continue our lessons.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.240
-Is something wrong?

11:39.323 --> 11:42.284
If something isn't right,
you must tell me. It's a rule.

11:42.368 --> 11:45.871
I feel silly in this hat.
I can't even see where I'm-- Oh!

11:49.083 --> 11:52.962
If you're going to be a lord,
you must stop feeling so much

11:53.045 --> 11:54.839
and start thinking.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.799
For instance, think about the hat.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.761
If you move it just a skosh to the right,
it will balance perfectly.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.054
Hey, you were right.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.932
A lord is always right. It's a rule.

12:10.730 --> 12:11.564
The book.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.484
The stool.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.740
I caution you, Hansel, the library
is my private sanctum sanctorum.

12:21.615 --> 12:26.579
Absolutely no one is allowed here
without my permission. It's a rule.

12:26.662 --> 12:30.666
Now, the book is titled
"Lordly Lessons for Laggardly Lads."

12:30.750 --> 12:34.962
And it will teach you all
there is to know about being a Lord.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.380
Read.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.050
Chapter one, lesson one:

12:40.134 --> 12:44.472
"A lord must always arrive
for dinner 15 minutes late."

12:44.555 --> 12:48.184
Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes, the common people
must be kept waiting

12:48.267 --> 12:51.145
because lords,
such as we two, are special.

12:52.730 --> 12:53.981
Nice.

12:54.064 --> 12:55.733
Lesson

12:55.816 --> 12:58.778
"A Lord must always remain on his horse."

12:59.403 --> 13:01.614
Uh, someone wrote that one in crayon.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.658
It's in the book, so it's a rule.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.454
Oh… 'Kay. So, do I get a horse?

13:08.537 --> 13:10.873
You mean… like this one?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.461
This is Jehorsephat.

13:18.589 --> 13:19.757
-Not yet.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.886
You must earn Jehorsephat
by completing your lessons.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.305
I will! I will! Lesson

13:26.388 --> 13:29.850
"A Lord must never lower his head,
only his eyebrows."

13:31.101 --> 13:32.019
Good. Good.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.356
You know, you remind me of… my son.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.734
He didn't
turn into a swallow, did he?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.195
You didn't eat him, did you?

13:41.278 --> 13:43.948
Heavens no. It was worse than that.

13:44.031 --> 13:46.909
-He left me to become…

13:47.910 --> 13:49.411
a pirate.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.582
-Pirates are cool.
-They most certainly are not.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.630
They're wild and dirty
and they don't follow the rules.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.382
Yes, right.

14:01.465 --> 14:05.302
Who'd wanna sail the Seven Seas,
having adventures and finding gold?

14:05.386 --> 14:06.887
Not me. Yuck.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.556
Yuck, indeed.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.183
-Oh, you are a good boy. Mmm.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.353
You may have a glimpse
of Jehorsephat.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.647
-Enough.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.986
Hansel, you won't leave me.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.113
-Will you?
-I promise.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.448
-I'll never leave you.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.827
And I promise on my word as a lord,

14:29.910 --> 14:35.082
that as long as you remain,
I will be like a father to you.

14:36.041 --> 14:40.254
Both Hansel and Gretel
were determined to fit in their new homes.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.841
For Hansel, this meant
less feeling and more thinking.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.760
And for Gretel, the opposite.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.848
Widow Fischer insisted
that her heart be her guide.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.062
-Are you thinking about that young man?
-What? No.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.273
I'm not thinking. I'm… Whoa!

15:01.400 --> 15:02.651
I'm feeling.

15:02.735 --> 15:07.239
Well, maybe you could
catch his eye with a new look.

15:11.076 --> 15:13.037
-Ew.
-Ooh!

15:16.081 --> 15:18.083
Ooh! Oh!

15:19.126 --> 15:20.127
I look awful.

15:20.210 --> 15:23.047
Yeah, I think
I might be terrible at make-overs.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.385
After so much sadness,

15:28.469 --> 15:32.765
Hansel and Gretel started to experience
the first step toward happiness.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.392
-Hope.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.811
Someday.

15:37.895 --> 15:39.647
You and me.

15:48.948 --> 15:49.823
Someday.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
You and me.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.957
This fish fry is nothing.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.043
In two days it's the Maypole Festival.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.587
Everyone will be there. Even Lord Meister.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.882
I hear he's adopted
a young boy around your age.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.467
Maybe you'll get to meet him.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.386
Ugh. I'm not interested.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.973
Oh, only got eyes for a certain
handsome, young man, huh?

16:14.056 --> 16:16.308
Well, I can't say that I blame ya.
Ooh la la.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.103
He is one salty anchovy, isn't he?

16:19.186 --> 16:22.064
And now, time for your archery lesson.

16:22.147 --> 16:25.734
-Ready. Aim. Fire.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.321
Well done, my boy.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.168
I heard you can fix anything.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.671
Can you fix my ring, please?

16:47.798 --> 16:48.799
Of course.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.307
-Good as new.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.309
Thank you!

16:59.393 --> 17:00.310
Twirl?

17:00.853 --> 17:01.895
Whee!

17:01.979 --> 17:04.106
I'm a bird.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.858
Me!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.234
Twirl me!

17:07.860 --> 17:09.111
He's looking!

17:09.695 --> 17:11.405
Do, do, do. Do, do.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.742
Gretel!
I wa-- I was hoping you would come.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.452
I'm here, too. I'm a widow.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.788
-Lonely widow, table for one.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.541
-What is that?
-It's magic twine.

17:22.624 --> 17:23.959
It fixes broken things.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.170
-Can it fix…

17:28.964 --> 17:32.051
Um… I'm sorry, broken hearts…

17:33.135 --> 17:34.803
They need something more.

17:34.887 --> 17:35.763
Mm.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.933
You're not like the other kids, are you?
You've endured a lot of pain.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.520
Can…

17:43.604 --> 17:45.689
-you fix this?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.242
It seems special to you.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.410
It is.

17:59.286 --> 18:00.454
You're special, too.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.082
Thank you.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.167
-Twirl?

18:13.342 --> 18:16.095
-Who's next?
-Me! Twirl me!

18:16.178 --> 18:19.181
-I won't throw up this time.

18:19.264 --> 18:21.100
After this, I'm having a party.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.060
-Games, dancing.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.937
You know, would you like to come?

18:25.020 --> 18:27.898
-Yes! Ahem. Yes.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.024
That would be nice.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.944
Oh, great. My house is the big red one,

18:32.027 --> 18:34.655
-just a little way into the woods.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.533
Not the deep dark woods?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.576
It's just a little way.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.912
You're not afraid, are you?

18:41.995 --> 18:44.164
No, no, no. It-- It's fine.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.458
I'll be there.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.835
Great. See you then.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.345
On to the next lesson.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.545
Why, thank you, Shillingworth.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.674
Hmm.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.808
Were you aware that the ants
in France wear scanty underpants?

19:44.892 --> 19:47.144
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Again.

19:47.227 --> 19:51.398
The ants in France wear scanty underpants.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.443
Perfect. I'm so proud of you, Hansel.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.903
And, as promised…

20:07.789 --> 20:10.083
-Good day, Jehorsephat.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.921
-I should very much like to ride you now.

20:16.423 --> 20:19.968
Of course, one may never ride
a new horse on a Sunday.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.470
It's a rule.

20:21.553 --> 20:25.140
But tomorrow, Jehorsephat is yours.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.517
I will be patient…

20:28.894 --> 20:29.728
Father.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.945
Knock, knock.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.906
-I made your favorite, fishghetti.
-Ugh.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.075
Hello?

20:43.158 --> 20:45.452
Thanks, but I'm saving my appetite
for the party.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.330
Oh, yeah, right, that young man's party.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.415
Well, I am glad that I wasn't invited.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.876
Probably such a cold night
to go walking out.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.087
No, it's just right there in the woods.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.255
The woods, right.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.510
-The woods? The deep dark woods?

21:01.593 --> 21:02.761
Have you lost your mind?

21:03.345 --> 21:07.307
Please. I've walked through more deep
dark woods than I can count on both hands.

21:07.391 --> 21:08.767
So at least nine.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.852
Not these deep dark woods.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.356
Are you crazy?
You can't go in there. I forbid it!

21:14.439 --> 21:18.819
You were the one who told me to follow
my heart and see what life brings.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.570
Well, I'm doing that.

21:20.654 --> 21:24.574
Yeah, well, follow your heart, but you got
to use your brain while you're doing it.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.077
And you're not doing it.
You're not thinking straight.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.372
You are only a child,
and I know what is best for you.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.251
First of all, you talk less crazy
when you're upset.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.462
Second, you're just jealous
because you weren't invited.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.382
I want real friends,
not just fish and old women!

21:42.050 --> 21:43.427
-Right.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.470
I'm…

21:45.554 --> 21:48.015
-I'm sorry.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.810
Follow your heart.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.319
Oh, no.
Don't do it. Just stay home.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.363
If you stay out of trouble,
you'll go to the Maypole Festival,

22:03.447 --> 22:06.199
and you'll see Hansel there,
and you'll be back together!

22:06.283 --> 22:07.451
She doesn't know that.

22:07.534 --> 22:11.496
Yeah, but she's going
into the deep dark woods!

22:11.580 --> 22:14.166
I mean, why would she
do something that dangerous?

22:14.249 --> 22:18.211
Well, haven't you ever had
that one special, enchanting friend?

22:18.295 --> 22:21.757
The coolest, the smartest,
maybe a little older,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.592
and they seem to like you.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.509
Totally.

22:24.593 --> 22:28.805
There was this blue jay,
we had so much fun together.

22:28.889 --> 22:32.392
Then I ate his eyeballs.
Turns out he was dead the whole time.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.103
And what would you do
for that special friend?

22:35.187 --> 22:38.106
More like what wouldn't you do.
Am I right?

22:38.607 --> 22:40.692
-Hm.

22:40.776 --> 22:44.363
-These woods aren't that scary.

22:50.077 --> 22:51.286
It's just the wind.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.294
A little rain never hurt anyone.

23:00.295 --> 23:03.048
Go home,
little girl, go home.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.175
To a warlock's house you go.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.221
-Go home, little girl, go home.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.515
To a monster's house you go.

23:13.433 --> 23:14.976
Hey, are you ignoring me?

23:15.977 --> 23:17.354
I'm the rain.

23:17.437 --> 23:21.066
Everyone knows I don't talk
unless it's really important.

23:23.026 --> 23:25.570
The rain can't talk.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.322
Oh yeah, of course not.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.826
I mean, the moon can eat children,
and heads can be sewn back on,

23:30.909 --> 23:33.495
and boys can turn into beasts, but rain?

23:33.578 --> 23:37.541
Talk? No.
That's where ya gotta draw the line, kid.

23:39.126 --> 23:42.754
-Good thinking, Gretel.
-Mmm. These bugs need hot butter.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.339
-Mmm.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.508
Things look frightening for Gretel.

23:46.591 --> 23:50.470
But at least Hansel is home,
safe and sound in bed.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.483
Leaving at night.
Isn't that against the rules?

24:14.828 --> 24:16.621
Psst! Jehorsephat.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.462
I know I'm not supposed
to ride you till tomorrow,

24:23.545 --> 24:27.424
but if Lord Meister
can break one little rule, why can't I?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.933
-Whoo-hoo!

24:37.017 --> 24:38.602
-Yeehaw!

24:49.905 --> 24:52.616
-Let's go. Let's go. Oh, here we go.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.370
-Yes!

25:13.345 --> 25:15.472
-I'll bet it all.
-Mm.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.648
-I can do this. Luck is on my side.

25:31.238 --> 25:33.365
Well, what a surprise. I win again.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.282
I assurify you,

25:34.366 --> 25:36.451
-I'm not using any devilocity.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.912
-I'm just cursed with good luck.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.373
-No! Wait! Wait!

25:41.456 --> 25:45.001
Give me one more chance.
I beg of you! Please!

25:45.085 --> 25:48.338
-But I have taken all of your coins.

25:48.421 --> 25:51.466
Eh, what could you possibly bet.
Your horse?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.719
Now that wouldn't be fair, would it?

25:54.803 --> 25:58.265
He's such a sweet, innocent, young horse.

25:58.348 --> 25:59.307
No. No.

26:02.936 --> 26:08.233
…something small, uh,
maybe something in your home.

26:08.316 --> 26:13.029
Yes, I will bet you whatever is in front
of the fireplace in your library.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.825
Uh…

26:16.908 --> 26:17.742
Done.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.628
Yes!

26:35.468 --> 26:36.553
-Oh!

26:36.636 --> 26:39.306
I'm so fiendishly sorry. Uh…

26:39.389 --> 26:45.270
Let me escortify you to your castle
to collect my debt.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.190
Well, I'm afraid
you're going to be disappointed.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.569
There's nothing of value
in front of that fireplace.

26:52.652 --> 26:55.196
-Nothing but a stool.

27:14.841 --> 27:19.179
Once upon a time, a young boy
was gambled away to the Devil,

27:19.262 --> 27:23.600
and a young girl
approached the home of a murderer.
