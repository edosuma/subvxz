WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:14.280 --> 00:16.080
That makes no sense, Dad.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.560
Tell me the truth already.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.360
All right.

00:38.240 --> 00:40.400
I met your mother, Lyn,

00:41.840 --> 00:43.120
here at Cielo Grande.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.560
We both competed in Summer Crush
and fell in love.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.000
So what's with all the mystery?

00:49.080 --> 00:50.480
Let me finish.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.360
Your grandparents said
Lyn didn't come from a good family,

00:55.440 --> 00:57.080
so they never accepted her.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.600
And to make things worse,

01:01.120 --> 01:02.760
your mother got pregnant.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.280
We didn't tell them anything
until she was far along,

01:07.360 --> 01:09.640
and for them, that was a huge insult.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.680
We went to live alone
without help from anyone,

01:15.920 --> 01:17.280
and things got complicated.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.680
And Mom's family?

01:22.080 --> 01:24.600
Lyn didn't want
to get her family involved either.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.600
And is that how I was born?

01:39.680 --> 01:40.520
Yes.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.480
We weren't ready.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.800
In fact, we didn't even go to a hospital,

01:50.040 --> 01:51.800
which was a big mistake.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.960
Your mother got sick,

01:56.920 --> 01:59.360
and a few months later, she died.

02:01.960 --> 02:04.160
Your grandparents took care of everything,

02:04.240 --> 02:07.480
taking care of you
and making up a nice story about Lyn.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.320
They decided I should quit college

02:11.400 --> 02:14.840
to keep up appearances of what
a family like ours should look like.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.680
But when they told me this story,

02:21.560 --> 02:22.840
it was never convincing.

02:26.760 --> 02:28.880
When your grandparents passed away,

02:28.960 --> 02:31.120
I was too afraid to tell you the truth.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.920
That's why I stuck with the story
they'd invented.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.640
I was scared you'd hate me.

02:41.640 --> 02:42.480
Look at me.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.400
How could I hate you?

02:47.560 --> 02:51.160
In fact,
I've never felt better with you than now.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.880
I'm really sorry
you weren't able to tell me sooner.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.800
Wouldn't it have been better?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.400
And Cynthia?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.560
How does Cynthia figure into all this?

03:12.640 --> 03:13.480
Cynthia?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.680
Yeah, Cynthia, Luz's mom.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.720
Honestly, on that trip,

03:21.240 --> 03:22.640
I met a lot of people.

03:23.640 --> 03:25.200
I don't remember her.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.640
I'm glad we were able to talk.

03:31.480 --> 03:32.440
Me too, Dad.

03:44.440 --> 03:48.120
What's up, guys? Juan Monzo here
exclusively from Sky Vibes.

03:48.200 --> 03:52.240
Today we have a report on the friend zone,
led by Charlie Santos.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.680
<i>-Go on with that report, Charlie.</i>
<i>-Now?</i>

03:55.280 --> 03:58.600
<i>-Well, Nati? Should we start?</i>
<i>-We agreed you wouldn't record me.</i>

03:59.120 --> 04:00.000
<i>Now, Charlie.</i>

04:00.560 --> 04:02.560
<i>All right, friends,</i>

04:02.640 --> 04:05.360
<i>the friend zone is</i>
<i>that classic area you enter</i>

04:05.440 --> 04:07.600
<i>when your love isn't reciprocated.</i>

04:07.680 --> 04:11.000
<i>In love, you think</i>
<i>that special person is your other half,</i>

04:11.080 --> 04:16.200
<i>but in reality, that person</i>
<i>only likes you as a friend.</i>

04:16.280 --> 04:18.880
Because they're
the other half of someone else.

04:20.120 --> 04:23.920
Guys, I want to confess
that those of us here

04:24.000 --> 04:26.640
have entered the friend zone.

04:28.520 --> 04:30.200
<i>Let's see. Charlie, enlighten us.</i>

04:30.280 --> 04:32.280
What are the stages of the friend zone?

04:32.360 --> 04:34.680
Well, first you experience denial.

04:34.760 --> 04:38.320
<i>You deny the possibility</i>
<i>that he or she isn't in love with you.</i>

04:38.400 --> 04:43.360
<i>Then comes anger or rage</i>
<i>when you realize this isn't the case.</i>

04:43.440 --> 04:45.520
<i>Then comes bargaining,</i>

04:45.600 --> 04:46.560
<i>depression,</i>

04:46.640 --> 04:48.920
<i>in order to finally come to acceptance,</i>

04:49.000 --> 04:50.920
<i>which is the stage I like most.</i>

04:51.000 --> 04:52.840
<i>The only option</i>

04:52.920 --> 04:54.480
<i>There's no love here</i>

04:54.560 --> 04:57.640
<i>I can't avoid it, have to accept it</i>

04:57.720 --> 04:59.200
<i>Friend zone!</i>

05:47.320 --> 05:48.440
Lose something?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.200
No, I didn't lose anything.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.400
What are you doing here at this hour?

05:56.040 --> 05:57.440
Luz, it's really late.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.840
Plus, it's a long story.
I'll tell you another day.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.240
But I have all the time in the world.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.920
-It's just that you won't believe me.
-Why not? You should trust me.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.560
I'm better at keeping secrets
than wake boarding.

06:13.320 --> 06:17.200
It seems my dad was hiding a secret
here at Cielo Grande.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.240
Your dad?

06:20.200 --> 06:22.600
I needed to check the hotel info.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.520
Okay. And now
what are you investigating here?

06:26.600 --> 06:29.160
I borrowed this guestbook.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.520
I had to investigate,
and look what I found.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.800
"The best trophy isn't always
the one you carry in your suitcase,

06:41.400 --> 06:43.920
as in addition to the river,
this enchanted place,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.520
and the magical stars, I found love."

06:47.120 --> 06:52.160
"I hope to come back really soon.
Ron Navarro Lavalle."

06:52.840 --> 06:54.280
"Guadalajara, Mexico."

06:56.840 --> 06:58.320
This is really love.

06:58.840 --> 06:59.680
Yeah.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.040
And a secret.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.720
But it's solved.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.120
My dad hid that he met my mom
competing at Cielo.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.920
But why did he hide it from you?

07:08.000 --> 07:10.160
It's great they met here.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.960
In reality, the ones who lied
were my grandparents.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.800
They didn't want
the whole truth to be known,

07:16.880 --> 07:21.320
because when my mom got pregnant with me,
they were scared to tell their families.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.960
You know. Different times.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.040
But I just talked with my dad.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.960
It was really hard,
but it's already all cleared up.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.360
Well, I'm happy it's all cleared up.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.880
Yeah, I'm really happy.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.600
I put a lot of energy into this.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.320
Yeah, with the competition,
you must be overwhelmed.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.680
-Focus on what's coming now.
-Thanks, Luz.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.440
I also made a friend on this adventure.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.560
That's true.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.840
I also made a friend.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.400
The best trophy isn't always
the one you carry in your suitcase.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.400
In the end, your dad was right.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.840
You can count on me for whatever you need.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.360
And you can count on me.

08:06.920 --> 08:07.800
Ready.

08:07.880 --> 08:11.040
What do you think of the design
for the Sky Vibes channel?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.440
-It's good.
-Good afternoon.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.120
-Good day.
-Good day.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.960
-That's the banner for the channel?
-Yeah. It's awesome.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.640
-Really professional.
-Thanks.

08:20.720 --> 08:23.040
We gotta hire them to do ours.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.280
We have to make a design
and start posting content.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.440
We could record rehearsals and post them.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.320
-I mean, like backstage.
-Great idea.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.840
We have to do something fun,
something flashy. Like a video clip.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.000
If you do a video,
it has to be romantic. That never fails.

08:38.080 --> 08:41.680
We already have the leads, Luz and Tony.
I saw them being very romantic.

08:43.560 --> 08:46.360
No!

08:46.440 --> 08:48.200
It's better to find other actors.

08:48.280 --> 08:50.880
Yeah, what if we made
a video about the friend zone?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.120
-Good idea.
-Good.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.040
Maybe don't count on me to act

08:54.120 --> 08:56.640
because this
would definitely affect my image.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.880
What image? Come on.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.400
-Good morning, princess.
-No.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.040
Not princess. Natasha.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.320
And I'd appreciate you not bothering me.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.360
I have two days
of very important training ahead.

09:28.440 --> 09:31.520
<i>And Cynthia?</i>
<i>How does Cynthia figure into all this?</i>

09:32.120 --> 09:35.120
-Cynthia?
-Yeah, Cynthia, Luz's mom.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.480
I don't remember her.

09:37.960 --> 09:41.280
But why is he hiding it from you?
It's great they met here.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.480
<i>I asked about his trip to Cielo Grande</i>
<i>when he was young,</i>

09:44.560 --> 09:46.320
and it was confusing.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.240
I met your mother, Lyn,
here at Cielo Grande.

09:50.280 --> 09:53.880
We were both competing in Summer Crush,
and we fell in love.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.840
That can't be. Not a single Lyn Ordóñez.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.800
<i>Hey, Steffi, I'm waiting for you.</i>
<i>Are you ready?</i>

10:37.520 --> 10:39.800
Yeah, I'm ready. See you in a minute.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.760
Take it easy on your run.
The drone will be following you.

11:01.680 --> 11:04.440
Hello and good day to you all.
About to train here

11:04.520 --> 11:08.320
<i>in the Canal del Norte and really close</i>
<i>to beating Steffi Navarro again.</i>

11:08.400 --> 11:11.000
And it seems like she's hiding from us.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.040
<i>Is she still sleeping?</i>

11:14.760 --> 11:16.360
<i>Or is she scared?</i>

11:17.320 --> 11:20.520
What a pity that we're training
with such an advantage.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.200
Sorry I'm late.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.080
How about going to the Correntoso River?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.000
Perfect.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.080
I imagine you've recharged
with yesterday's dinner with Julián.

11:39.680 --> 11:42.840
I'd say the same about you and Lucecita.
Where is she?

11:43.440 --> 11:45.080
Waiting for us in the boat.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.240
Look.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.240
<i>Hello and good day to you all.</i>
<i>About to train here</i>

11:52.320 --> 11:56.000
<i>in the Canal del Norte and really close</i>
<i>to beating Steffi Navarro again.</i>

11:56.520 --> 11:58.840
<i>And it seems like she's hiding from us.</i>

11:59.920 --> 12:01.720
<i>Is she still sleeping?</i>

12:02.360 --> 12:03.960
<i>Or is she scared?</i>

12:04.880 --> 12:06.200
<i>What a pity that we're--</i>

12:06.280 --> 12:08.360
How does she manage to be so awful?

12:09.240 --> 12:11.680
Clearly she wasn't raised as well as you.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.840
Are you okay? It was just a joke.

12:16.920 --> 12:18.560
No, it's not that.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.640
Yesterday my dad confessed

12:20.720 --> 12:23.800
that my grandparents hid
the fact that he met my mom here.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.360
And I can't stop thinking about it.

12:27.560 --> 12:28.400
Weird.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.480
He told me
your mother's never been to Cielo.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.200
All right. Shall we?

12:39.840 --> 12:40.680
Yeah.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.400
Thanks.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.160
Guys, look at this.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.000
-Turned out great, huh?
-Yeah.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.680
-What if we made the clip with pics?
-Yeah, totally.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.960
But they gotta be real friend-zone pics.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.640
Luckily, they're not nothing-zone pics.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.160
Poor guy.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.280
What if we asked everyone for pics?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.640
Good idea. I'll handle it.
Let's see. Here.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.400
Hi.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.560
Urgent!

13:08.640 --> 13:10.080
Friend-zone clip.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.040
Please send pics and videos of Cielo.
Thanks so much.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.720
-It's gonna be great.
-Yeah.

13:14.800 --> 13:17.080
We have to include something really cool.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.760
I know! Sharks!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.040
-Sharks?
-Yeah.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.760
Sharks are cool?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.600
-Of course they are.
-Well…

13:24.680 --> 13:26.600
I'll do it anyway. It'll be great.

13:27.520 --> 13:28.360
-Nati.
-Yeah?

13:28.440 --> 13:30.720
-Can we order some fries?
-Please.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.720
-But you just had breakfast.
-But we're really hungry.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.360
All right. Sit here.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.760
-Thanks.
-I'll get them.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.000
Steffi,

13:48.520 --> 13:50.880
the conditions here are not at all easy.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.520
This is how we'll practice the run.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.440
Okay, let's start
with the championship run like always.

13:57.520 --> 14:02.480
First, 180. Then the outward spins.
On the way back, we'll do the back spins.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.720
The easiest ones first
and then the more complicated ones.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.400
Towards the end of the last run…

14:08.960 --> 14:12.440
I met your mother, Lyn,
here at Cielo Grande.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.200
<i>I know who the girl in the picture is.</i>

14:19.280 --> 14:20.240
It's Luz's mom.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.480
<i>Her name is Cynthia. Luz told me herself.</i>

14:22.560 --> 14:25.000
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>about your girlfriend?</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:26.880
<i>And also that she's Luz's mom?</i>

14:26.960 --> 14:30.080
-What do you mean?
-What secret are you hiding at Cielo?

14:30.160 --> 14:33.160
We both competed in Summer Crush,
and we fell in love.

14:33.240 --> 14:36.480
The river is low,
and there are some logs in the way.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.160
Ready?

14:44.600 --> 14:47.200
-Are you ready?
-Yeah, I am.

14:48.800 --> 14:51.600
Is everything all right?
You look distracted.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.200
No. Everything's good.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.720
Let's not even give Natasha a chance.

15:19.120 --> 15:20.600
First trick, perfect.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.760
Now that you're gaining good speed,
your spins should come and…

15:26.600 --> 15:28.720
All right! Nice style! That's good!

15:33.480 --> 15:34.320
Yes!

15:35.120 --> 15:36.280
That's it, Steffi.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.760
Now let's go with flips.
First the back flip.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.480
Good. Next trick.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.800
Good. Another.

15:50.280 --> 15:53.000
Perfect.
The coach who taught you that is amazing.

15:54.760 --> 15:58.160
Now get ready for the move.
Be careful on the landing.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.160
-Watch out for the log!
-Watch out!

16:09.240 --> 16:10.240
Watch out, Steffi!

16:14.080 --> 16:15.080
Steffi!

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
Come on! Let's go! Steffi!

16:21.360 --> 16:22.200
Steffi.

16:23.840 --> 16:24.680
Steffi.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.800
Grab her from the other side.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.240
-Do you hear me, Steffi?
-Hurry.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.640
Pedro, come on!

16:34.320 --> 16:37.960
-We're coming, Steffi.
-Careful! Careful with her head.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.120
Careful with her head, Pedro.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.760
Steffi, can you hear us?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.760
Steffi, do you hear me? Steffi?

16:45.840 --> 16:48.600
Pedro, call Augusto
and tell him we're coming.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.760
<i>The only option</i>

16:53.840 --> 16:55.800
<i>There's no love here</i>

16:55.880 --> 16:57.800
<i>I can't avoid it</i>

16:57.880 --> 16:59.520
<i>Have to accept it</i>

16:59.600 --> 17:02.360
-I love how it came out.
-Look what I'm testing.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.120
Play.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.720
I have to admit when you mentioned sharks,
I didn't understand at all,

17:07.800 --> 17:08.800
but it's great.

17:08.880 --> 17:10.200
Look at this now, Nati.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.760
You're a genius.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.920
Yeah, I know. I get told that a lot.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.000
Hold on, Charlie. Something happened.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.080
-Charlie!
<i>-We're there in five minutes.</i>

17:51.440 --> 17:53.880
Relax, Steffi.
We're already back. Breathe.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.800
Here come the boys,
and everything's gonna be all right.

17:56.880 --> 17:59.400
Here. Give me the neck brace.

18:01.720 --> 18:02.960
Careful.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.640
-Here it is.
-One, two, three. Up.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.840
All right. Here it is. Strap her in.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.360
Let's go on three. One, two, three.

18:12.440 --> 18:13.600
-All right.
-Excuse us.

18:15.520 --> 18:16.640
Careful on the stairs.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.880
Relax. It's gonna be all right.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.440
A little more to the right.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.040
-Relax. We're almost there, Steffi.
-Careful.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.520
-We're here.
-Excuse us.

18:25.600 --> 18:26.640
Careful!

18:30.240 --> 18:32.800
It seems like
this isn't Steffi's best day.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.760
<i>I just finished training.</i>

18:37.840 --> 18:40.400
<i>The run at Canal del Norte was amazing.</i>

18:40.480 --> 18:43.960
<i>Tomorrow we're training</i>
<i>in the Correntoso River and that's it!</i>

18:44.040 --> 18:45.560
<i>Ready for the competition.</i>

18:46.080 --> 18:47.520
<i>Well, I am at least,</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:51.600
<i>because it seems like Steffi Navarro</i>
<i>isn't gonna be up to it</i>

18:51.680 --> 18:53.120
<i>since she had an accident.</i>

18:53.200 --> 18:56.560
<i>I just found out</i>,
<i>and we'll see what happens.</i>

18:57.080 --> 18:58.120
<i>A pity.</i>

19:00.760 --> 19:04.120
Steffi makes
the competition easier every time.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.000
Clearly she's not at my level.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.960
Even so, I want to beat her in the water.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.080
If she doesn't show up,
it will have made no sense to come here.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.720
Thanks.

19:34.040 --> 19:34.920
Rest.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.000
You're gonna get better. You'll see.

19:40.080 --> 19:41.040
Come in, please.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.280
This is Dr. Berizzo.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.440
Hello. Could you leave the room, please,
so I can examine her?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.440
-Yes?
-Yes.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.800
It's already been 15 minutes.
Will she be okay?

19:59.880 --> 20:02.600
-Steffi's conscious.
-But she's confused, isn't she?

20:03.440 --> 20:06.560
Yeah, but that can happen
if you get hit hard.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.200
Doctor, how is she?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.760
She'll have to recover slowly.
She got hit on the head hard.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.080
Can we see her?

20:17.160 --> 20:20.960
Right now it's better if you don't.
The blow gave her a large contusion.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.400
-Can we do anything to help her?
-She's in observation, guys.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.400
Above all, she needs rest.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.600
At least today.
Tomorrow we'll see if she can compete.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.000
It all depends on how she recovers.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.280
-Are you friends or family?
-Friends.

20:34.360 --> 20:36.600
Although, Julián would like to be more.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.760
Then I suggest, if you're her friends,

20:38.840 --> 20:41.280
help her so she can rest
as much as needed.

20:41.360 --> 20:44.480
She needs some quiet.
That's important, okay?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.280
-I'll go with you.
-Excuse me.

20:46.840 --> 20:47.840
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.920
Thank you.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.480
We should let her rest.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.960
We should take the opportunity
to rest too, right?

21:03.000 --> 21:04.680
It's better if you go.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.040
I'm staying with her.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.040
Tony.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.320
Thanks for helping me today.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.360
We make a great team.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.160
Good evening.

21:38.280 --> 21:41.120
-Dad?
-Honey, are you all right?

21:41.640 --> 21:43.200
What does she mean, "Dad"?

21:44.560 --> 21:45.640
Good night, Ron.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.200
Good night, guys. Rest up.
Thanks for everything.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.960
<i>So Ron is Steffi's dad.</i>

22:03.680 --> 22:07.040
-They hid it, but it doesn't make sense.
-Let's not get into this.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.760
-What matters is that Steffi gets better.
-Yeah.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.720
And what are we doing with Sky Vibes?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.400
I don't know. Do we close down?

22:13.480 --> 22:16.200
-Close? No. Why?
-Because of what happened to Steffi.

22:16.280 --> 22:18.560
She was lucky.
It could've been much worse.

22:18.640 --> 22:22.440
-Yeah, it could've been terrible.
-Steffi's gonna be all right. Relax.

22:22.520 --> 22:25.800
Of course she will.
She's one of the strongest people I know.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.960
Yeah, you're right.
We have to keep going to save Cielo.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.080
What do we need?

22:30.160 --> 22:32.880
To build the sponsorship page,
plan the show…

22:32.960 --> 22:36.440
I'm progressing on the page.
But I thought you'd have the show ready.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.800
Of course there's one but what songs?
We haven't thought about it.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.800
We have "Friend Zone."
The video is turning out great.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.560
-I'm finishing it tomorrow.
-And what else do we have?

22:45.640 --> 22:48.480
-The classics. "Emergency Love," "Now."
-"Now."

22:48.560 --> 22:50.440
"A Thousand Steps" and "Warm Beauty."

22:50.520 --> 22:53.000
-"Warm Beauty" needs to be finished.
-I'm on it.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.280
-I'll help.
-All right.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.320
Let's add the "Lofty Sigh" cover.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.800
-We'll handle that as well.
-Perfect.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.400
We could tell the twins to add something.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.720
-Okay.
-Yeah, I'll handle that too.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.600
-Great.
-Excellent.

23:05.680 --> 23:07.680
I love how this is shaping up.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.680
<i>Boa.</i>

23:10.520 --> 23:11.360
<i>Gostei.</i>

23:30.840 --> 23:32.640
I saw Ian looking kind of sad.

23:33.200 --> 23:37.320
If you want to check on him,
I can stay with Steffi.

23:48.280 --> 23:49.120
Luz.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.160
Thanks so much for everything.

24:04.880 --> 24:07.240
No, watch out!
Watch out for the log, Steffi!

24:12.160 --> 24:13.440
Steffi!

25:10.760 --> 25:11.600
Luz.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.200
Hi.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.960
How are you feeling?

25:20.280 --> 25:21.720
Good. Better.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.680
What were you looking at?

25:27.080 --> 25:28.560
My birthmark.

25:28.640 --> 25:29.920
I have one too.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.800
Yeah, I know.

25:34.840 --> 25:37.920
The weird thing is my birthmark
is the same as yours.

25:38.960 --> 25:40.120
Look.

25:50.600 --> 25:51.440
Luz.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.320
I haven't told you everything.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.360
It's likely that you and I

26:02.240 --> 26:03.360
are sisters.

26:04.920 --> 26:05.760
What?
