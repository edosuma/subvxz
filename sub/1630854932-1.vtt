01:19.557 --> 01:21.342
Mom?

01:23.996 --> 01:26.303
Are you gonna get up?

01:29.567 --> 01:30.699
You have work.

01:32.744 --> 01:33.832
I'm gonna go in late.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.842
This is one of
my absolute favorite looks

02:26.842 --> 02:31.194
because everything's very
fresh, dewey, not too much.

02:31.194 --> 02:34.066
We're just gonna be able to
do a little more with this.

02:34.066 --> 02:39.202
And then I like to go from
the corner up like this.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.813
So we're going from
the natural eye shape.

02:43.163 --> 02:46.905
So we just have this dramatic
thing here that enhances

02:46.905 --> 02:49.734
what we've already got,
which I really love.

02:49.734 --> 02:50.953
Great, love that.

02:50.953 --> 02:54.086
Look how your eyes
just like totally pop.

02:54.086 --> 02:55.740
It looks great.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.569
Next week we're gonna be
doing lip liner tutorials,

02:58.569 --> 03:01.224
so I hope you guys will
tune in, like, subscribe.

03:13.671 --> 03:16.500
She could have
done literally anything.

03:17.936 --> 03:20.504
You always talk about
her, what about me?

03:20.504 --> 03:22.376
You're never on my corner.

03:22.376 --> 03:23.420
Oh, yes, she can text me.

03:23.420 --> 03:25.770
She can send me apology.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.858
We've been friends.

03:26.858 --> 03:30.210
I didn't wanna hear
her on the phone.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.342
She can send me apology.

03:55.147 --> 03:56.061
Stop.

04:06.898 --> 04:08.552
See, he's hot.

04:14.776 --> 04:17.735
Oh my God Leah, he just
looked at your boobies.

04:17.735 --> 04:21.478
Stop
it, no, he didn't.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.610
He so did.

04:22.610 --> 04:24.742
You're so obvious.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.309
No, I'm not.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.919
Yes you are.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.611
Could I please get
the strawberry frosted?

05:07.611 --> 05:09.309
Sprinkles
or no sprinkles?

05:09.309 --> 05:10.310
Sprinkles.

05:27.979 --> 05:28.893
It's like someone busted a nut

05:28.893 --> 05:30.330
right in the middle of that.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.205
Ew, Amber.

05:44.256 --> 05:46.041
You're disgusting.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.666
Oh my God, you're
driving me crazy.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.106
I'm sorry, can you just
turn the sound off?

06:12.502 --> 06:15.244
You're on your
phone all the time.

06:16.245 --> 06:18.900
'Cause I'm fucking bored.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.945
Well, in a few weeks
you'll be complaining

06:20.945 --> 06:22.338
that you're back in school.

06:25.907 --> 06:28.257
Well, you know, you
could get a summer job.

06:29.084 --> 06:30.520
If you want, you could
come and do a few hours

06:30.520 --> 06:32.130
a week with me.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.088
No thank you.

06:35.046 --> 06:38.398
Have you even started
your summer reading?

06:39.834 --> 06:40.791
Going to.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.794
You haven't even
started it yet?

06:43.794 --> 06:47.232
Mom, stop, I told
you I'm gonna do it.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.075
I'm gonna go out.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.250
What?

07:06.121 --> 07:08.079
I just made this whole dinner.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.299
You're gonna just
leave me all alone.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.344
You're fine, mom.

07:12.344 --> 07:14.129
No, I'm not.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.132
You didn't even like him.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.221
Yes, I did.

07:23.007 --> 07:24.487
You're so mean to me.

07:24.487 --> 07:27.142
No, I'm not, you just
don't like what I'm saying.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.639
Does it feel good?

07:47.031 --> 07:48.424
I'm gonna cum.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.263
Can you move over?

08:03.134 --> 08:04.309
Yeah, sorry.

08:05.659 --> 08:06.616
Thanks.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.208
Thanks.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.540
Bitch.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.368
Stop, these are
fucking new, stop.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.674
Stop, stop, stop.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.375
Can't call a girl she's heavy.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.203
You are though.

09:12.203 --> 09:13.291
I'm gonna get an
eating disorder now.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.249
No, no.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.042
She was a 10 when she was in
middle school, but, you know,

09:25.042 --> 09:28.132
got bad, so she's
like a seven now.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.918
Too hot, she's
like six possibly.

09:30.918 --> 09:32.397
Six, 6.5, whatever.

09:32.397 --> 09:33.790
But Sarah.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.749
She's so hot.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.315
Oh, she's, oh God.

09:37.315 --> 09:39.840
So she's like a nine.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.972
I agree she's like
a nine for sure.

09:41.972 --> 09:43.321
She's like an 11.

09:43.321 --> 09:44.801
Maybe higher.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.237
What a beautiful,
what's the word?

09:46.237 --> 09:47.151
Voluptuous?

09:47.151 --> 09:48.370
Curvy, whatever, she's fire.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.372
What, no.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.548
Yeah, see, thank you.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.160
Brings back memories.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.640
Jared stop.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.337
That's so rude, you're gonna
have to clean it all up.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.602
Stop, that's so rude.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.432
I don't care.

10:09.304 --> 10:10.261
Excuse you Leah.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.927
I'm ready for, you guys ready?

10:23.927 --> 10:25.799
Yeah, let's roll.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.629
Oh, we haven't
gotten the check yet.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.111
That's 'cause we're piecing.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.027
Guys.

10:37.027 --> 10:38.333
Ladies first, come on.

10:38.333 --> 10:41.292
We can just meet you at
Seven-11 if you want.

10:41.292 --> 10:43.599
No, I don't wanna do that.

10:44.687 --> 10:45.862
Okay, suit yourself.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.298
We're gonna go, come on.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.212
Come on.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.918
All right fuck,
let's go, come on.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.275
Hey, where you going?

11:09.494 --> 11:10.931
Hey, stop it.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.760
Stop, said you stop
and stay right here.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.413
Ow, get off of me.

11:15.413 --> 11:16.980
And you too.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.286
Both of you, get
inside right now.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.504
Leah.

11:20.157 --> 11:21.158
Let go of me.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.159
I said stay here.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.683
Get the fuck off of me.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.901
- Get off you her.
- You get inside right now.

11:24.901 --> 11:25.946
You come.

11:28.731 --> 11:32.343
Hey, what are you doing, man?

11:32.343 --> 11:34.519
Those fucking kids
didn't pay their bill, man.

11:34.519 --> 11:37.392
You don't hit a
fucking girl like that.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.872
Get back inside right now.

11:55.279 --> 11:56.411
Hey.

11:59.196 --> 12:00.110
Hi.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.374
Are you okay?

12:05.463 --> 12:06.421
I'm fine.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.556
Must have hurt.

12:17.954 --> 12:18.955
You need any help?

12:20.087 --> 12:21.653
No thanks.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.655
Even just a ride, no.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.311
No rides from strangers.

12:28.530 --> 12:32.447
That's a very fair
and responsible point.

12:33.665 --> 12:34.579
Understood.

12:36.712 --> 12:40.281
But I'm probably just gonna
have to keep you company

12:40.281 --> 12:43.806
while you walk then, right?

12:44.981 --> 12:47.157
Just to make sure
you get home safely.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.776
What do you wanna listen to?

12:57.820 --> 13:02.477
Thinking, Top 40, huh?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.003
No.

13:11.094 --> 13:13.531
Maybe they're a country
gal, is that what you are?

13:14.619 --> 13:15.838
No, I got it.

13:20.364 --> 13:21.583
Oldies.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.238
You can't go wrong with
the oldies, come on.

13:26.196 --> 13:27.502
All right.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.460
All right, she
likes the oldies.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.294
♪ Nobody cry

13:37.294 --> 13:38.818
Come on, get in.

13:39.601 --> 13:43.561
♪ She's a girl of the world

13:48.175 --> 13:50.786
Don't murder me, okay?

13:52.266 --> 13:53.484
I promise I will not.

14:07.759 --> 14:08.978
Where are we going?

14:10.066 --> 14:11.546
Just keep heading straight.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.899
What's your name?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.770
Leah.

14:19.684 --> 14:20.424
What's yours?

14:20.424 --> 14:21.643
Tom.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.957
Make a right.

14:30.957 --> 14:31.914
You got it.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.794
Is it cool if I smoke in here?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.537
Sure, just roll
the window down.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.869
All right, let me have a drag.

15:24.097 --> 15:27.187
Yeah, these are disgusting.

15:31.582 --> 15:33.062
I quit a long time ago.

15:38.589 --> 15:41.114
So why didn't you go
with your friends?

15:43.768 --> 15:44.726
I don't know.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.556
They're arseholes
for leaving you.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.429
They're just dumb sometimes.

15:53.648 --> 15:56.738
Well, I think you're a
lot more mature than them.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.091
Serious.

16:02.091 --> 16:05.747
Yeah, you seem cool.

16:06.748 --> 16:07.967
You should be hanging
out with people

16:07.967 --> 16:09.620
who are a lot more
on your level.

16:18.281 --> 16:19.804
Right up here is good.

16:32.469 --> 16:37.170
Well, it was really
nice meeting you.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.397
I should give you
my phone number,

16:48.833 --> 16:52.663
in case you need a ride again.

16:57.407 --> 16:58.539
How old are you?

17:01.672 --> 17:03.718
I'm 34, how old are you?

17:08.592 --> 17:09.506
I'm 17.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.730
Thank you.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.558
Yeah, no problem.

18:02.733 --> 18:05.084
Bye.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.978
What is he doing here?

18:29.978 --> 18:30.935
Leah.

19:13.978 --> 19:16.720
Think you and Jared
are gonna start dating.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.895
I don't know.

19:19.723 --> 19:23.031
Well, would you want
to like, if he asked?

19:24.815 --> 19:26.077
Probably not.

19:26.077 --> 19:28.036
I thought you were
like obsessed with him.

19:29.342 --> 19:34.521
Not really, I
like somebody else.

19:36.566 --> 19:38.002
What?

19:38.002 --> 19:40.831
Oh my God, you like Darren?

19:40.831 --> 19:43.878
Ew, Darren, no.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.534
Well then who?

19:52.495 --> 19:54.193
Oh my God, who, who, who?

19:55.585 --> 19:57.718
He goes to another school.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.807
What school?

19:59.807 --> 20:02.157
I don't even know anyone
that goes to another school.

20:02.157 --> 20:03.202
I do.

20:03.898 --> 20:06.466
Oh, really, what school then?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.425
I'm not saying.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.297
What school?

20:12.428 --> 20:14.256
I don't wanna jinx it.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.866
Oh my god Leah, come on.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.607
Just tell me the school.

20:20.436 --> 20:21.742
He goes to Vista.

20:22.917 --> 20:23.874
Vista.

20:28.052 --> 20:28.966
Okay.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.149
Emma's coming over in
a few minutes by the way.

20:43.981 --> 20:44.895
What?

20:47.115 --> 20:48.116
Nothing.

20:50.292 --> 20:51.250
What?

20:52.381 --> 20:54.731
I just don't get why
you're friends with her.

20:56.820 --> 20:57.821
God.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.301
But it's fine.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.349
We don't have to like
all the same people.

21:31.855 --> 21:32.987
No one cares.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.946
No one cares, exactly.

21:37.121 --> 21:38.079
Hey, Leah.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.603
Hey.

21:48.959 --> 21:51.179
Oh my God, that's bad.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.355
Enough of that one.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.966
Oh my God, I didn't
realize that was her.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.403
Yeah, oh my God.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.929
Oh, that's a no for me.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.800
That's a no for me.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.239
Hey, wait, where you going?

22:08.239 --> 22:10.372
I gotta go help my
mom with something.

22:11.895 --> 22:12.853
Okay.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.731
Would it help you?

22:26.997 --> 22:29.652
Paparazzi?

22:35.571 --> 22:36.833
How was your day?

22:38.661 --> 22:39.575
Fine.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.061
What are you up to tonight?

22:48.192 --> 22:49.106
Nothing.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.022
I'm gonna have a friend over.

22:53.067 --> 22:55.156
You can hang out
with us if you want.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.201
Which friend?

22:57.201 --> 22:58.072
Glen.

22:59.116 --> 23:00.074
Who's Glen?

23:01.554 --> 23:06.036
From Carlsbad, the dentist.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.298
You know who Glen is.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.868
Why can't you go to his place?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.653
Oh, he's already on his way.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.050
I don't wanna
be here for this.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.140
Then you don't have to be.

23:23.140 --> 23:26.405
Fine, I'm gonna go out.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.190
Fine.

23:31.018 --> 23:33.150
I don't mind a
little privacy anyway.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.414
Ew.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.198
I asked you not to
tell me those things.

24:16.106 --> 24:20.241
Are you one of those
people who watches sunsets?

24:21.590 --> 24:23.462
What does that mean?

24:23.462 --> 24:28.118
Like hashtag BRB,
chasing sunsets.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.990
What, what does that mean?

24:29.990 --> 24:31.470
Like on Instagram.

24:33.123 --> 24:38.302
Okay like the same people who
hashtag living my best life.

24:40.217 --> 24:41.784
Yeah.

24:41.784 --> 24:44.657
Are the same people who
post photos of sunsets.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.753
What's wrong with chasing
something that's beautiful?

24:55.058 --> 24:56.233
What?

24:58.627 --> 24:59.715
That is so corny.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.893
All right, so you
don't like sunsets.

25:03.893 --> 25:07.070
We know that, heart of stone.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.551
What do you like?

25:12.075 --> 25:13.294
I don't know.

25:14.730 --> 25:18.342
Well, what do you wanna
to do after high school?

25:20.519 --> 25:22.216
I haven't really
thought about it.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.653
It's okay.

25:24.653 --> 25:26.176
I definitely didn't
know what I wanted to do

25:26.176 --> 25:29.528
when I was your age,
you don't have to.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.838
My mom thinks I should
know what I'm interested in.

25:35.838 --> 25:38.537
You know, have hobbies.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.758
She thinks it'll help
me get into college.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.370
Do you want to go to college?

25:46.370 --> 25:47.589
I mean, no offense to your mom.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.112
I'm sure she's a
really nice person,

25:49.112 --> 25:52.202
but she might not know
what she's talking about.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.856
You know, there's a
lot of different ways

25:53.856 --> 25:55.379
to live a good life,

25:56.250 --> 25:59.209
and you don't have to go
to college to do that.

25:59.209 --> 26:03.213
I live my life any
way that I want,

26:03.213 --> 26:06.216
and I don't have to listen
to anybody else to do that.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.872
And that is real freedom.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.353
Real freedom.

26:16.444 --> 26:17.445
What do you do?

26:18.315 --> 26:19.578
Absolutely nothing.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.406
No, I have a small business.

26:22.406 --> 26:23.756
I do repairs and remodeling.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.106
That's cool.

26:26.106 --> 26:27.324
Yeah, I was pretty good
at building stuff to start.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.805
I work for myself, so
I set my own terms.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.946
I guess I like
to sing sometimes.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.251
Oh yeah.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.340
Well, maybe you
should quit smoking

26:43.340 --> 26:45.386
so you can save your voice.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.344
I only smoke sometimes.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.391
Sure, you do, smoker.

26:50.391 --> 26:53.481
Hey, besides tons of
singers of raspy voices.

26:53.481 --> 26:55.004
Yeah, that's true.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.746
Still, hold on a sec.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.798
Hey, why don't you
sing me something?

27:05.798 --> 27:06.842
No.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.844
Come on, please.

27:08.844 --> 27:09.671
Absolutely.

27:09.671 --> 27:10.846
Why not?

27:10.846 --> 27:14.284
Just a little something,
I wanna hear you.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.985
No, all right.

27:20.203 --> 27:24.033
I will get you to
sing at some point.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.427
Just wait.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.740
Oh shit, I got some work stuff.

27:36.872 --> 27:38.004
I'll drive you home.

27:45.881 --> 27:46.795
What?

27:49.798 --> 27:51.321
Can I see you tomorrow?

27:54.063 --> 27:55.369
Okay, yeah.

27:58.981 --> 28:04.030
Ew, why do you even
watch that shit?

28:05.248 --> 28:06.380
I didn't put it on.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.339
Somebody did.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.440
You look pretty.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.399
Thanks.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.496
Is it Vista boy?

28:40.762 --> 28:41.763
Maybe.

28:41.763 --> 28:42.721
Shut up.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.596
Gonna get a beer.

29:02.044 --> 29:03.132
Hey.

29:03.132 --> 29:04.481
You scared me.

29:09.399 --> 29:10.487
What?

29:10.487 --> 29:11.401
Nothing.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.972
What are you doing?

29:16.972 --> 29:20.671
Nothing, I'm just
not really in the mood.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.762
And why'd you come
over here then?

30:43.493 --> 30:46.279
Your bathing
suit's mismatched.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.471
Hey.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.171
Thank you.

31:09.171 --> 31:13.828
Why don't you tell me about
your family by yourself.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.491
Where's your dad?

31:26.406 --> 31:27.711
He lives in Arizona.

31:29.583 --> 31:30.540
Yeah.

31:34.936 --> 31:37.373
My dad didn't want
a family either.

31:37.373 --> 31:40.463
Oh, he has a family,
it's just not me.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.423
His wife wanted it that way.

31:43.423 --> 31:44.990
I'm sorry to hear that.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.079
It's okay.

31:49.820 --> 31:53.215
And what about your mom?

31:54.390 --> 31:56.349
Is she wondering where you are?

31:58.917 --> 31:59.743
No.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.528
No, oh man.

32:03.443 --> 32:05.662
Well, that's
not actually true.

32:06.794 --> 32:09.579
She gets really clingy
with me when she's single

32:09.579 --> 32:12.539
and then sometimes she
asks me where I am.

32:16.325 --> 32:17.674
Is she single now?

32:19.589 --> 32:21.026
I can't keep track anymore.

32:25.856 --> 32:29.121
Some people just have
no business having kids

32:30.470 --> 32:31.601
and they do anyway.

32:36.519 --> 32:39.174
What about you,
where are your parents?

32:40.697 --> 32:41.524
Oh, my mom's not too far away.

32:41.524 --> 32:43.091
She's about 30 miles north.

32:44.484 --> 32:47.530
And my dad, last time I heard
he was working in Nevada.

32:49.271 --> 32:52.840
So I know how you
feel about your dad.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.585
You wanna go in the water?

32:59.542 --> 33:01.109
Sure.

33:01.109 --> 33:01.980
Yeah.

33:31.922 --> 33:32.880
You suck.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.141
Did you have fun with Amber?

35:02.100 --> 35:05.712
Yeah, we went to the beach.

35:06.756 --> 35:07.844
That sounds like fun.

35:40.834 --> 35:42.401
That's crazy.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.358
I know.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.394
Can I kiss you?

36:22.310 --> 36:23.268
Yes.

37:03.699 --> 37:04.787
Oh, I look chopped.

37:04.787 --> 37:06.049
Oh my God.

37:06.049 --> 37:09.227
Oh my God, it's
going on my story.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.402
Don't post that.

37:11.925 --> 37:13.274
Or what?

37:13.274 --> 37:15.972
You know what your
Vista boy to see?

37:17.974 --> 37:19.367
I mean, the thing is though,

37:19.367 --> 37:21.064
is that I looked
through your Instagram

37:21.064 --> 37:22.544
and you don't even
follow anyone from Vista.

37:22.544 --> 37:25.591
You looked at
who I'm following?

37:26.766 --> 37:28.463
You left me no choice.

37:28.463 --> 37:29.812
That's psycho.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.206
No, it's not psycho,
it's resourceful.

37:34.643 --> 37:35.905
What?

37:35.905 --> 37:38.560
You can't hide him
from me forever.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.083
I just don't wanna jinx it.

37:40.780 --> 37:43.391
We just kissed the other day.

37:43.391 --> 37:44.349
Yawn.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.265
It was actually really sweet.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.397
Please call me when
you fucked him.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.529
Stop.

37:51.660 --> 37:54.837
I don't know when or
if that's gonna be.

37:54.837 --> 37:57.362
When, if, so you want to.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.276
I guess.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.929
Oh my God, just do it.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.845
Just the next time you see
him, just walk up to him,

38:02.845 --> 38:05.195
grab him by the dick
and just be like,

38:06.501 --> 38:08.503
that's not play games.

38:35.051 --> 38:37.924
Can we go back to your place?

38:41.623 --> 38:43.712
I mean, if you want to.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.764
Yeah, of course.

39:23.404 --> 39:25.580
I thought we were
going back to your place.

39:29.279 --> 39:32.021
This is my place.

39:35.764 --> 39:39.377
Oh, okay.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.860
It's just temporary,
my lease was up

39:44.860 --> 39:48.342
and I'm just kept out here
until I can find a new spot.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.915
I know it's not fancy.

39:58.874 --> 40:01.311
No, it's totally chill.

40:04.924 --> 40:06.795
I can just take
you home if you want.

40:06.795 --> 40:07.753
No.

40:11.800 --> 40:12.975
All right.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.153
Do you wanna come inside?

40:17.153 --> 40:18.111
I do.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.786
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable

41:24.786 --> 41:29.443
and I'll make us
some drinks, yeah?

41:40.062 --> 41:40.933
What'll it be?

41:42.325 --> 41:43.326
Anything's fine.

41:45.328 --> 41:48.767
Well, what do you drink
when you're with your friends?

41:51.334 --> 41:53.336
Whatever they're
drinking guess.

41:54.599 --> 41:55.643
Right.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.079
All right.

42:21.190 --> 42:22.409
Cheers.

42:32.593 --> 42:33.986
I'm really glad we met.

42:38.773 --> 42:40.122
Me too.

42:40.122 --> 42:43.561
Yeah, you know, you're just,

42:44.605 --> 42:47.260
you're not like any
girl like I know.

42:49.392 --> 42:50.219
Really?

42:50.219 --> 42:51.351
Really.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.921
I feel like that
can be open with you.

42:57.705 --> 42:58.750
Like, you see me.

43:00.316 --> 43:03.363
I feel like I can
really see you.

43:10.152 --> 43:12.372
I feel that way too.

43:15.201 --> 43:19.988
Did we get like
brought together by fate?

43:23.426 --> 43:25.820
Is that a crazy thing to say?

43:25.820 --> 43:28.649
I feel like it's a crazy thing.

43:28.649 --> 43:29.868
You're not crazy.

44:07.340 --> 44:08.863
Could you turn off the lights?

44:08.863 --> 44:09.777
Yeah.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.375
Hey, let's get your swimsuit.

45:28.464 --> 45:29.378
Sit still.

45:31.206 --> 45:32.991
We're gonna see if
you like butter.

45:35.645 --> 45:36.821
Put your chin up.

45:39.301 --> 45:41.129
Well, what's the verdict?

45:41.129 --> 45:42.217
What do you know?

45:42.217 --> 45:44.306
You've got a bad case of it.

45:44.306 --> 45:45.743
I do.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.789
Hold on a second, chin up.

45:50.312 --> 45:51.487
Oh no.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.621
You got a bad case of it too.

46:03.325 --> 46:04.805
What's that?

46:04.805 --> 46:06.328
It's just a song I like.

46:06.328 --> 46:08.766
Yeah, can I hear a bit?

46:11.246 --> 46:12.552
Just a little bit.

46:14.336 --> 46:15.511
Okay, fine.

46:15.511 --> 46:19.037
Just a part of it.

46:20.603 --> 46:23.302
Got a performance

Hey, Leah.

48:04.882 --> 48:05.839
Hey.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.538
Who's this?

48:09.538 --> 48:11.366
This is my friend.

48:11.366 --> 48:12.890
Tom.

48:12.890 --> 48:13.803
Emma.

48:15.457 --> 48:17.764
We were just about
to head out actually.

48:18.765 --> 48:20.462
You sure you
can't stick around?

48:20.462 --> 48:22.464
We're doing a bonfire later.

48:22.464 --> 48:25.250
Bonfire, sounds fun.

48:26.207 --> 48:29.819
It will be, you should stay.

48:29.819 --> 48:30.820
Even if she can't.

48:30.820 --> 48:33.562
We really have to get going.

48:35.477 --> 48:39.960
Too bad, another time then.

48:39.960 --> 48:41.570
Yeah, another time.

48:44.225 --> 48:45.966
Stop it Emma.

48:45.966 --> 48:47.663
So you're allowed to
hook up with Tyler

48:47.663 --> 48:49.796
and I'm not even
allowed to talk to Tom.

49:14.734 --> 49:15.691
Are you okay?

49:16.692 --> 49:18.042
Yeah, I'm fine.

49:30.010 --> 49:31.446
Why are you laughing?

49:33.709 --> 49:38.888
Because you are so cute
when you get jealous.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.721
I'm not jealous.

49:45.721 --> 49:48.289
No.

49:48.289 --> 49:53.207
Well that's a shame
because I'm jealous.

49:56.819 --> 49:57.733
Who's Tyler?

50:00.127 --> 50:02.042
Who's Tyler?

50:02.042 --> 50:03.000
He's nobody.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.568
He's nobody, who's Tyler?

50:07.395 --> 50:08.396
I swear.

50:12.226 --> 50:16.926
I don't want to see
other guys, you understand?

50:18.058 --> 50:19.016
I'm not.

50:22.628 --> 50:27.807
Because you are,
you're mine, right?

50:39.514 --> 50:41.603
Good, get in the car.

50:50.264 --> 50:54.181
Yeah, these look well
moisturized and hydrated.

50:56.618 --> 51:01.623
These look like certified
genuine princess hands.

51:05.888 --> 51:07.412
I don't know if that's
a compliment or not.

51:07.412 --> 51:08.674
It's a compliment.

51:08.674 --> 51:10.719
Thank you, you're like.

51:18.901 --> 51:20.338
Who is that?

51:20.338 --> 51:23.689
It's just a friend.

51:24.994 --> 51:27.606
Hold on a sec, gimme a minute.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.872
I'll be right back.

51:35.570 --> 51:37.616
Shut your fucking mouth.

52:36.065 --> 52:37.676
Outta here.

52:37.676 --> 52:40.418
Just get the fuck out right now.

52:41.767 --> 52:43.551
You don't want me.

53:11.100 --> 53:12.319
I'm sorry about that.

53:13.407 --> 53:14.626
Is everything okay?

53:15.670 --> 53:19.326
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

53:20.414 --> 53:21.546
What's going on?

53:22.677 --> 53:24.201
My friend needed something.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.030
Your friend lives here?

53:28.030 --> 53:32.861
Yeah, she just need a little
bit of help with something.

53:33.601 --> 53:35.255
What kind of help?

53:35.255 --> 53:39.781
With a guy, with a
guy that she's seeing.

53:41.870 --> 53:43.220
Like her boyfriend?

53:43.959 --> 53:44.786
Yeah, yeah.

53:44.786 --> 53:45.874
Like her boyfriend.

53:53.447 --> 53:55.884
Why won't you tell
me what's going on?

53:55.884 --> 53:56.798
I am telling you
what's going on.

53:56.798 --> 53:58.583
There's nothing to worry about.

53:59.975 --> 54:02.717
It's her boyfriend and
he's drunk sometimes.

54:23.303 --> 54:24.261
Okay.

54:33.879 --> 54:36.751
I just wanna
reiterate, I like to use.

54:39.014 --> 54:42.104
Natural aid when
we do this part.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.853
Hey.

54:51.853 --> 54:54.116
So you haven't been
answering any of my texts.

54:54.116 --> 54:56.989
Sorry I'm not
glued to my phone.

54:57.685 --> 54:58.947
Where's your mom?

54:58.947 --> 55:00.122
At work.

55:03.517 --> 55:08.348
So Emma said she saw you
at the beach with some guy,

55:09.828 --> 55:11.786
an old guy named Tom.

55:16.791 --> 55:18.140
He's not that old.

55:18.140 --> 55:19.925
No way, so, it's true.

55:21.013 --> 55:23.189
Okay, is Emma
telling everybody?

55:24.016 --> 55:25.887
She said, she was
just telling me.

55:26.975 --> 55:29.543
You just have to promise
not to tell anybody.

55:29.543 --> 55:30.805
Yeah, obviously.

55:30.805 --> 55:33.068
But like, why
didn't you tell me?

55:35.636 --> 55:38.944
I was going to, I'm sorry.

55:40.032 --> 55:42.034
You just have to swear
not to tell anybody.

55:43.209 --> 55:45.472
I mean, yeah, as long
as you tell me everything.

55:46.995 --> 55:48.606
Okay, pinky swear.

55:51.565 --> 55:52.479
Kiss it.

55:56.831 --> 55:58.006
It's really good.

55:59.530 --> 56:01.053
It's not really good.

56:01.836 --> 56:03.490
It's what we got.

56:04.926 --> 56:06.406
Really?

56:06.406 --> 56:08.190
Yeah, I mean, you don't
know a good piece of pizza

56:08.190 --> 56:13.326
until you've gotten a
slice in New York City.

56:14.632 --> 56:15.676
Maybe you'll have to
take me to New York then.

56:15.676 --> 56:17.025
Show me the good stuff.

56:18.853 --> 56:20.420
You want me to take you away?

56:21.378 --> 56:22.988
You wanna run away with me?

56:25.817 --> 56:26.774
Maybe.

56:30.517 --> 56:33.738
Oh, give me a minute.

56:37.785 --> 56:38.743
Hello.

56:50.058 --> 56:51.799
Everything okay over here?

56:51.799 --> 56:52.757
It's great.

56:54.454 --> 56:55.412
Are you okay?

56:56.630 --> 56:58.153
Yeah.

56:58.893 --> 56:59.677
What do you mean?

56:59.677 --> 57:00.634
Do you need help?

57:02.636 --> 57:04.986
There's a phone in the back,
I can make a call for you.

57:04.986 --> 57:06.640
He does not have to know.

57:09.730 --> 57:11.166
Doesn't have to know what?

57:12.603 --> 57:13.908
You can tell me.

57:14.518 --> 57:15.867
Tell you what?

57:19.087 --> 57:24.092
Look, it's just he
comes in here with girls.

57:24.092 --> 57:26.094
I don't know what
you're talking about.

57:26.094 --> 57:27.095
He's my boyfriend.

57:33.754 --> 57:38.019
Hey, can we get
a box for that?

57:40.065 --> 57:43.851
Something came up, I
gotta take you home, okay?

57:43.851 --> 57:44.809
Okay.

57:46.071 --> 57:48.508
Good, I'm sorry.

57:49.248 --> 57:51.380
Got this draining issue

57:51.380 --> 57:53.165
and I should have
dealt with it myself

57:53.165 --> 57:55.776
instead of asking somebody
else to look after it.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.126
You all right?

58:00.346 --> 58:03.871
Are you like
dating other girls?

58:05.133 --> 58:09.442
No, why would you ask me that?

58:10.965 --> 58:11.705
I don't know.

58:11.705 --> 58:12.663
What?

58:14.708 --> 58:16.275
It's just that the waitress.

58:17.972 --> 58:19.539
This waitress?

58:19.539 --> 58:23.238
Yeah, she said that she sees
you there with other girls.

58:23.238 --> 58:24.762
So.

58:24.762 --> 58:27.199
I've never seen this waitress
before in my entire life.

58:27.199 --> 58:31.508
So she's definitely confusing
me with somebody else, okay.

58:33.205 --> 58:34.511
Okay, just forget it.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.816
Leah.

58:35.816 --> 58:37.731
Hold on a sec, will you
take this for a second?

58:37.731 --> 58:39.080
Let me just clear this up.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.168
I've never seen this, hold on.

58:40.168 --> 58:42.431
Tom, don't.

58:43.955 --> 58:44.912
One sec.

59:13.724 --> 59:15.203
She apologized.

59:18.772 --> 59:19.730
Okay.

59:21.819 --> 59:22.863
Just take me home.

59:28.565 --> 59:32.612
You know I really don't
appreciate this, Leah.

59:32.612 --> 59:35.876
I mean what have I ever done

59:35.876 --> 59:37.878
to give you a reason
not to trust me?

59:39.793 --> 59:40.751
Nothing.

59:43.797 --> 59:44.755
You trust me?

59:46.321 --> 59:47.235
Yeah.

59:48.106 --> 59:49.063
Yeah.

59:50.151 --> 59:52.676
I want to hear you say it.

59:55.069 --> 59:56.157
What?

59:56.157 --> 59:58.812
I want you to
say, I trust you.

1:00:02.729 --> 1:00:03.817
I trust you.

1:00:09.606 --> 1:00:10.607
I trust you too.

1:00:25.186 --> 1:00:27.362
There you are, I
haven't seen you in days.

1:00:28.189 --> 1:00:30.670
Yep, I'm here.

1:00:30.670 --> 1:00:33.499
What have you been up to?

1:00:36.197 --> 1:00:38.460
You wanna watch
something on TV tonight?

1:00:39.244 --> 1:00:41.072
I'm hanging out with Amber.

1:00:41.072 --> 1:00:42.900
Aw, I think
you've been spending

1:00:42.900 --> 1:00:44.510
so much time with her lately.

1:00:45.598 --> 1:00:46.599
Not really.

1:00:47.948 --> 1:00:51.430
Well, we haven't been
spending any time together.

1:00:52.561 --> 1:00:54.433
I'm surprised
you even noticed.

1:00:56.043 --> 1:00:58.263
It's not like you've
been around much anyways.

1:00:58.263 --> 1:01:00.657
Of course I noticed, stop it.

1:01:04.878 --> 1:01:05.836
Geez.

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:15.323
So which one of your
boyfriends dumped you this time?

1:01:16.150 --> 1:01:17.325
Or was it all of them?

1:01:23.244 --> 1:01:25.246
What's the matter with you?

1:01:25.246 --> 1:01:26.421
It's fine.

1:01:28.249 --> 1:01:30.338
I know I'll always come second.

1:01:30.338 --> 1:01:31.122
It's whatever.

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:32.297
You're my daughter.

1:01:32.297 --> 1:01:33.211
Of course you come first.

1:01:33.211 --> 1:01:35.300
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:01:40.435 --> 1:01:43.438
Some people have no
business having kids.

1:01:46.267 --> 1:01:47.442
Excuse me?

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:52.926
I said that some people
have no business having kids.

1:01:58.192 --> 1:02:01.108
He gets them
ball, puts on back

1:02:01.108 --> 1:02:03.110
and hits it while he's
fucking from behind.

1:02:03.110 --> 1:02:05.417
I'm dead ass, I'm
fucking dead ass.

1:02:05.417 --> 1:02:08.376
Bro, come on that's
fucking bullshit.

1:02:08.376 --> 1:02:10.639
Dude, that is not even
anatomically possible.

1:02:10.639 --> 1:02:12.293
All right, look,

1:02:12.293 --> 1:02:14.208
I'm just telling
you what he told me

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:15.949
and he told me he's
done it a bunch.

1:02:15.949 --> 1:02:17.777
Yeah well, he's
a fucking liar.

1:02:17.777 --> 1:02:20.040
Jared, you're just jealous.

1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:21.433
I'm not jealous.

1:02:23.304 --> 1:02:26.743
So Leah, who
you've been up to?

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:28.309
Shut up Pat.

1:02:28.309 --> 1:02:30.007
You don't need to
answer that Leah.

1:02:30.007 --> 1:02:31.835
We all know what
you've been up to.

1:02:34.054 --> 1:02:35.229
Oh, come on.

1:02:35.229 --> 1:02:36.796
Don't gimme that confused look,

1:02:36.796 --> 1:02:39.756
we all know that you've been
hanging out with the geriatric.

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:41.105
Jared you asshole.

1:02:42.149 --> 1:02:45.979
Leah, I didn't mean
to say anything.

1:02:45.979 --> 1:02:48.460
And they said that they
would never repeat it.

1:02:48.460 --> 1:02:50.592
I promise, I'm sorry.

1:02:50.592 --> 1:02:52.507
Leah, the man is a pervert.

1:02:54.074 --> 1:02:55.119
No he's not.

1:02:55.119 --> 1:02:56.337
He's a pedophile.

1:02:57.077 --> 1:02:59.210
I don't blame him, I mean,

1:02:59.210 --> 1:03:01.168
we all know younger
girls feel different.

1:03:01.168 --> 1:03:03.083
Ew Patrick.

1:03:04.432 --> 1:03:04.998
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1:03:04.998 --> 1:03:06.347
Yes, I do.

1:03:06.347 --> 1:03:07.871
I literally fucked
that older lady.

1:03:07.871 --> 1:03:09.524
She was like in her forties,

1:03:09.524 --> 1:03:10.438
but she actually was kind
of hot, to be honest.

1:03:10.438 --> 1:03:11.788
Disgusting Patrick.

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:12.527
No, you didn't.

1:03:12.527 --> 1:03:14.181
Yes I did.

1:03:14.181 --> 1:03:15.748
No, you didn't.

1:03:15.748 --> 1:03:16.444
On that trip with my family
to Mexico, I told you about.

1:03:16.444 --> 1:03:17.924
I swear to God, bro.

1:03:17.924 --> 1:03:20.100
I'm not a kidding, older
women, they feel different.

1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:21.101
It's like not as good.

1:03:21.101 --> 1:03:22.537
I think it like,

1:03:22.537 --> 1:03:24.191
it like stretches out
over time or something.

1:03:24.191 --> 1:03:26.628
I'm
too high for this.

1:03:26.628 --> 1:03:28.630
I'm just saying
like, this guy's lucky.

1:03:28.630 --> 1:03:30.807
Did you shut the
fuck up, Patrick.

1:03:31.546 --> 1:03:32.721
You're disgusting.

1:03:33.853 --> 1:03:36.029
It's just a joke,
those old saggy balls.

1:03:37.422 --> 1:03:38.727
Leah.

1:03:38.727 --> 1:03:40.120
Leave me alone.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.166
Oh my God, Leah.

1:03:43.036 --> 1:03:44.472
Get off of me.

1:03:44.472 --> 1:03:45.734
I'm sorry, okay.

1:03:45.734 --> 1:03:47.127
Geez, they just kept
asking where you were.

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:48.476
You didn't need
to say anything.

1:03:50.478 --> 1:03:51.740
Can't you see how much

1:03:51.740 --> 1:03:53.699
they don't even wanna
hang out with you?

1:03:54.526 --> 1:03:56.528
They know you'll
fuck any of them.

1:03:57.964 --> 1:03:59.531
They just keep you around
for when one of them decides

1:03:59.531 --> 1:04:00.837
that they feel like it.

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:26.863
I'm sorry about earlier.

1:04:52.714 --> 1:04:54.151
What's wrong?

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:00.809
Okay.

1:05:02.463 --> 1:05:03.595
I hate them.

1:05:05.466 --> 1:05:09.122
Oh, well, they never matter.

1:05:11.472 --> 1:05:12.996
They never matter, right?

1:05:16.477 --> 1:05:18.740
You're the only
person I even like.

1:05:20.481 --> 1:05:21.526
Oh, good.

1:05:22.657 --> 1:05:25.791
'Cause that's all
we need, right?

1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:28.185
You and me.

1:05:34.408 --> 1:05:37.194
And this perfect fucking face.

1:05:56.604 --> 1:05:58.824
You know I love you, right?

1:06:00.695 --> 1:06:02.175
And you love me,

1:06:07.615 --> 1:06:10.575
and you're never gonna leave me.

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.666
I won't leave you.

1:06:16.146 --> 1:06:17.103
Good.

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.022
Because nobody loves you
the way that I love you.

1:06:27.809 --> 1:06:29.463
Hold on a second.

1:06:38.864 --> 1:06:40.431
I made you this.

1:06:56.664 --> 1:07:00.320
Oh my God.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:03.758
Dear me chasing the sunset.

1:07:03.758 --> 1:07:05.064
I thought you'd like it.

1:07:05.064 --> 1:07:06.674
You had this made?

1:07:06.674 --> 1:07:09.503
Yeah, of course I did for you.

1:07:09.503 --> 1:07:10.287
Oh my God.

1:07:10.287 --> 1:07:11.070
Put it on.

1:07:11.070 --> 1:07:12.376
I love it.

1:07:12.376 --> 1:07:14.073
Put it on, I wanna
see it on your wrist.

1:07:14.073 --> 1:07:15.509
I'm gonna wear
it all the time.

1:07:15.509 --> 1:07:18.686
Good, come here.

1:07:28.087 --> 1:07:29.697
I wanted to get you something

1:07:29.697 --> 1:07:32.048
so you could think of me
when we can't be together.

1:07:33.701 --> 1:07:35.790
I wish we could be
together all the time,

1:07:37.531 --> 1:07:39.838
and I never have to
deal with anybody else.

1:07:45.409 --> 1:07:48.760
Then let's go be alone
together someplace,

1:07:50.109 --> 1:07:51.589
just for a few days.

1:07:54.113 --> 1:07:55.114
Really?

1:07:55.114 --> 1:07:56.463
Yeah, I think we
need a vacation.

1:07:56.463 --> 1:08:00.859
I think we just need
to be the two of us.

1:08:04.297 --> 1:08:05.646
Can we leave tonight?

1:08:07.648 --> 1:08:09.563
We can leave tomorrow.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:13.654
How's that sound?

1:08:17.005 --> 1:08:18.006
Okay.

1:08:51.649 --> 1:08:52.867
Oh boy.

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.369
If somebody had told you
that night at the diner

1:09:16.369 --> 1:09:19.851
where we'd be now, what
would you have thought?

1:09:22.810 --> 1:09:25.465
I would've thought
that there's just no way

1:09:25.465 --> 1:09:28.860
that I could be this lucky.

1:09:31.732 --> 1:09:32.994
Really?

1:09:32.994 --> 1:09:35.867
Really,
what about you?

1:09:39.175 --> 1:09:40.654
I just never thought
somebody like you

1:09:40.654 --> 1:09:42.178
would even be into me.

1:09:48.923 --> 1:09:50.925
I wanted you the
first moment I saw you.

1:10:04.852 --> 1:10:09.988
And I've been thinking
about some things

1:10:13.252 --> 1:10:16.342
about you and everything,
and about your mom,

1:10:18.431 --> 1:10:21.304
and I wanna be the one to
take care of you from now on.

1:10:24.045 --> 1:10:25.133
What do you mean?

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:28.006
I mean, I want it
to be you and me.

1:10:30.051 --> 1:10:32.053
I wanna be the
one to protect you

1:10:33.098 --> 1:10:35.361
and to give you
everything that you need.

1:10:35.361 --> 1:10:38.756
I wanna be that guy
so that you don't have

1:10:38.756 --> 1:10:40.627
to get help from anybody else.

1:10:46.894 --> 1:10:48.069
Yeah.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.302
And that can start, right now.

1:11:17.925 --> 1:11:19.449
Stand up, come over here.

1:11:20.928 --> 1:11:21.842
Right here.

1:11:31.765 --> 1:11:32.723
Take this off.

1:11:38.119 --> 1:11:40.208
I can't go close to the blind.

1:11:40.208 --> 1:11:42.080
No, no, no, no, no.

1:11:44.125 --> 1:11:45.605
I wanna see you.

1:12:06.713 --> 1:12:07.627
No.

1:12:50.017 --> 1:12:51.454
Take these off.

1:13:31.232 --> 1:13:32.582
Take that off.

1:13:42.069 --> 1:13:43.244
Turn around.

1:13:48.554 --> 1:13:50.469
You get on your knees.

1:14:04.091 --> 1:14:06.093
No, with your mouth.

1:15:21.429 --> 1:15:23.040
Thank you.

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.521
Hold on a sec, here you go.

1:15:36.923 --> 1:15:38.011
What are you doing?

1:15:38.011 --> 1:15:41.188
I'm just straightening up.

1:16:08.781 --> 1:16:09.739
Come over here.

1:16:12.959 --> 1:16:15.658
I need your help with something.

1:16:18.617 --> 1:16:20.140
Okay.

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:22.012
I need you to do
something for us.

1:16:23.230 --> 1:16:24.144
Okay.

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:31.499
There's a guy that
wants to meet you.

1:16:35.721 --> 1:16:39.377
So I have arranged for
him to meet you tonight.

1:16:44.164 --> 1:16:47.472
Do you remember

1:16:49.169 --> 1:16:52.608
what a good time we
had when we got here?

1:17:02.487 --> 1:17:04.315
I want you to show
him a good time.

1:17:08.667 --> 1:17:09.581
Do you remember?

1:17:13.106 --> 1:17:14.368
It's just like that.

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:28.469
I don't wanna do that.

1:17:35.128 --> 1:17:37.391
You told me that you want
me to take care of you.

1:17:37.391 --> 1:17:39.916
This is how I would
take care of you.

1:17:48.228 --> 1:17:50.404
I don't wanna do that.

1:18:07.247 --> 1:18:12.426
You said that you wanted
it to just be the two of us.

1:18:16.430 --> 1:18:18.606
So I need you to do this

1:18:18.606 --> 1:18:21.522
because we're gonna need money.

1:18:36.929 --> 1:18:39.453
I don't think I can do that.

1:18:42.021 --> 1:18:44.371
You have no idea how easy

1:18:44.371 --> 1:18:48.854
this is going to be because
you're so fucking good at it.

1:19:02.999 --> 1:19:04.087
Okay, okay.

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:10.484
I'm gonna go.

1:19:13.226 --> 1:19:16.403
He's gonna be here
in just a little bit.

1:19:16.403 --> 1:19:18.841
He and I have talked
about everything.

1:19:20.277 --> 1:19:23.149
There is nothing to
worry about, okay?

1:19:37.424 --> 1:19:38.643
Hey, hey.

1:19:43.996 --> 1:19:45.693
I love you, okay?

1:19:55.616 --> 1:19:56.574
Okay.

1:20:04.625 --> 1:20:06.453
Okay, okay, okay.

1:20:25.472 --> 1:20:29.128
There is nothing to
worry about, all right.

1:20:30.956 --> 1:20:32.044
Look at me.

1:20:36.570 --> 1:20:38.659
Jesus, you look so pretty.

1:20:53.239 --> 1:20:54.153
Okay.

1:22:10.664 --> 1:22:12.710
Hello, you all right?

1:22:20.065 --> 1:22:20.979
Yeah.

1:22:31.598 --> 1:22:32.817
It's okay.

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.560
You don't need to be scared.

1:22:38.954 --> 1:22:40.651
It's your first night, right?

1:22:46.526 --> 1:22:47.658
Don't be nervous.

1:23:05.981 --> 1:23:09.549
Really, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1:23:11.899 --> 1:23:13.292
I'm a nice guy.

1:23:33.138 --> 1:23:35.010
Come here, come here.

1:23:52.679 --> 1:23:53.898
You from around here?

1:23:58.033 --> 1:24:01.819
Yeah, me too, born and raised.

1:24:06.780 --> 1:24:07.738
How old are you?

1:24:14.353 --> 1:24:15.311
It's okay.

1:24:17.965 --> 1:24:19.750
It's probably
better I don't know.

1:24:29.977 --> 1:24:34.765
Relax, told you
I won't hurt you.

1:24:41.728 --> 1:24:43.730
You're really quite beautiful.

1:24:49.562 --> 1:24:51.782
What do you say when
someone compliments you?

1:24:53.479 --> 1:24:54.437
Thank you.

1:25:17.329 --> 1:25:19.549
See how hard you make me.

1:25:50.710 --> 1:25:52.016
Take your shirt off.

1:26:30.881 --> 1:26:32.317
just like that.

1:26:34.754 --> 1:26:36.495
You're good at that.

1:27:18.885 --> 1:27:20.060
That's good.

1:31:09.202 --> 1:31:10.116
Hey.

1:32:05.432 --> 1:32:07.260
You wanna try a bite?

1:33:01.619 --> 1:33:05.101
Go to the bathroom
for just a second.

1:35:43.302 --> 1:35:44.695
Can you come pick me up?

1:35:51.223 --> 1:35:52.529
Yeah, I'll drop a pin.

1:36:16.379 --> 1:36:17.423
Thank you.

1:36:17.423 --> 1:36:18.381
Yeah.

1:36:19.556 --> 1:36:22.298
Yeah, if my mom asks, we only
took the car to Darren's.

1:36:24.387 --> 1:36:27.694
So what are you doing here?

1:36:29.479 --> 1:36:30.697
I was with Tom.

1:36:34.353 --> 1:36:35.267
What happened?

1:36:38.009 --> 1:36:39.358
We got in a fight.

1:36:45.538 --> 1:36:46.801
Fuck that guy, right?

1:36:57.028 --> 1:36:59.639
Can we talk about yesterday.

1:37:03.339 --> 1:37:05.645
I don't really feel like
talking about anything.

1:37:05.645 --> 1:37:09.127
Don't be a bitch, okay,
I'm trying to apologize.

1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:12.522
Look, I'm really sorry.

1:37:13.697 --> 1:37:16.961
I should have kept your secret,
I always keep your secrets.

1:37:16.961 --> 1:37:18.267
Then why didn't you?

1:37:20.617 --> 1:37:22.575
I was worried
about you, I'm sorry.

1:37:31.323 --> 1:37:33.282
Okay, I'm sorry too.

1:37:35.937 --> 1:37:41.116
It's okay.

1:37:42.857 --> 1:37:44.162
Can we start driving?

1:38:11.494 --> 1:38:13.452
Where are you going?

1:38:13.452 --> 1:38:15.106
I have to get a listing ready.

1:38:15.977 --> 1:38:17.195
There's an open house tomorrow

1:38:17.195 --> 1:38:19.110
and I don't have
time to do it then.

1:38:21.504 --> 1:38:22.461
Could I come?

1:38:28.250 --> 1:38:29.251
If you want to.

1:38:50.054 --> 1:38:51.621
Do you need any help?

1:38:53.579 --> 1:38:58.497
Yeah, do you wanna
clean that back window?

1:38:58.497 --> 1:38:59.455
Yeah.

1:40:17.837 --> 1:40:20.884
Taking a shot of
the mystery, Ben.

1:40:23.495 --> 1:40:25.280
Yeah, baby shot.

1:40:29.153 --> 1:40:30.502
Thought you loved us.

1:40:30.502 --> 1:40:31.329
Oh yeah.

1:40:31.329 --> 1:40:33.157
Oh yeah, bro.

1:40:33.157 --> 1:40:34.506
I would but.

1:40:34.506 --> 1:40:38.075
All right guys, I'm
already too fucking.

1:41:01.794 --> 1:41:03.970
How many do you need?

1:41:07.191 --> 1:41:09.802
I don't like any of these.

1:41:11.369 --> 1:41:14.198
I think this is
what they have.

1:41:23.729 --> 1:41:27.777
I don't like these,
you should put them back.

1:41:41.095 --> 1:41:43.358
What are you gonna
wear on the first day?

1:41:45.751 --> 1:41:47.623
I haven't really
thought about it.

1:41:52.236 --> 1:41:53.281
Can I have some?

1:41:54.847 --> 1:41:55.979
Yeah.

1:42:04.596 --> 1:42:05.771
That's pretty.

1:42:08.687 --> 1:42:13.823
Thanks.

1:42:22.527 --> 1:42:23.528
The
number you dialed

1:42:23.528 --> 1:42:25.487
has been changed, disconnected,

1:42:25.487 --> 1:42:29.230
or is no longer in
service, if you feel you.

1:42:32.798 --> 1:42:35.975
The number you dialed has been
changed, disconnected, or.

1:42:39.849 --> 1:42:43.374
The number you dialed has
been changed, disconnected,

1:42:44.810 --> 1:42:47.900
the number, dial
changed, disconnected,

1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.815
or is no longer in service.

1:44:45.931 --> 1:44:47.019
Yeah.

1:44:47.019 --> 1:44:48.369
Is Tom here?

1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:50.458
No.

1:44:51.589 --> 1:44:53.287
Do you know where he is?

1:44:53.287 --> 1:44:55.941
No, fuck that guy, I
don't care where he went.

1:44:57.334 --> 1:45:02.165
Oh, I just really
need to talk to him.

1:45:03.427 --> 1:45:07.301
Okay, I mean, if he didn't
tell you where he went,

1:45:07.301 --> 1:45:08.954
then maybe it's not a good.

1:45:08.954 --> 1:45:09.868
Please.

1:45:11.305 --> 1:45:12.436
You should go home.

1:45:12.436 --> 1:45:13.785
I can't find him anywhere.

1:45:13.785 --> 1:45:15.047
If you could please just help me

1:45:15.047 --> 1:45:16.875
like even with a phone
number or something.

1:45:16.875 --> 1:45:18.137
It's an emergency.

1:45:27.451 --> 1:45:31.194
Okay, yeah, hold on.

1:45:40.812 --> 1:45:42.379
Hi.

1:45:42.379 --> 1:45:46.122
No, there's a girl at my door
who wants to talk to you.

1:45:48.820 --> 1:45:49.908
No, she knows you.

1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:53.477
What's your name again?

1:45:53.477 --> 1:45:55.000
Leah.

1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.567
She says her name's Leah?

1:46:00.919 --> 1:46:02.138
No, she's alone.

1:46:04.358 --> 1:46:06.272
I don't think so, yeah, okay.

1:46:16.413 --> 1:46:18.937
Tom, don't hang up.

1:46:26.031 --> 1:46:27.163
Where are you?

1:46:37.695 --> 1:46:39.305
Why didn't you try to find me?

1:47:00.239 --> 1:47:01.806
I miss you too.
