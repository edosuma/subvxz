WEBVTT

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
All right, then.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
Where were we?

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Now I remember.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
"A note about witches."

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
See, here's the thing
about them.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
They're real!

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Witches are as real as a rock
in your shoe.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
That's the first thing
you need to know.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
The second thing
you need to know,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
they're here!

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
And they live amongst us...

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
...side by side, with humans.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
In every big city,
in every small town.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
For all you know,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
a witch might be living right
next door to you right now.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
They everywhere!

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
A witch might be a nurse,

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
or your teacher,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
and you can bet
your sweet patootie

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
that friendly, little old lady
on the bus

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
offering you a delicious piece
of salt water taffy

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
is a witch.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
And here's
the most important thing.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
The most important thing.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Witches hate children!

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
A witch spends all her time

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
thinking up ways
to destroy children.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
That's all she thinks about.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
"How will I squish
this horrible child?"

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
A witch gets the same pleasure
from squishing a child

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
as you get from eating
a bowl of ice cream

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
covered in butterscotch syrup,

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
with whipped cream,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
chopped nuts,

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
and a cherry on top.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
My story begins
during the last month of 1968.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
Believe it or not,
I was once a young boy.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
A boy with a mother
and a father.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
We lived in Chicago.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
And it snows a lot
at Christmastime.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Tricky thing with snow is,
it's slippery.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Take the front! This way!

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
Mom?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
I was wearing my seat belt.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
-Dad?
-

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Mom!

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
Mama and Daddy weren't.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Mama! Dad!

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Mommy! Dad!

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Let's get you
out of here.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
It was during
my eighth Christmas

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
that I lost
my mother and father.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
My dear child...

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Grandma.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
Grandma's here.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Aw,
you gonna be all right.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Here, let me look at you.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Mmm.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
I'mma get you out of here.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
I packed your things,
I'm gonna take you home.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Home? To my house?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
No, darling.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Home to my house.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Need any help

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
bringing these bags
inside, sister?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Oh, no,
thank you, Reginald.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
You've done enough already.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Running into you
at the bus station

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
was a godsend.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
-I'm much obliged.
-

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
I'll see you in church
come Sunday?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh,
you know you will.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance, young man.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.000
Welcome to Demopolis.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
-Thank you, Reggie.
-Sister.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
Wait.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
Take them shoes off before
you walk on my good rug.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Grandma was my mama's mama.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
A tough lady with a big heart.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
The kind that
wouldn't hesitate

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
to give a spanking
if you deserve it

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
or a big ol' hug
if you needed it.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I reckon...

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
you'll be comfy here.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
In your mama's old room.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We'll get you
situated tomorrow.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
I'm gonna make
some hot chocolate.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Want some?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I'm gonna make some anyway,

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
in case you change your mind.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
High tomorrow, 73.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
Young man,
what is wrong with you?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Sitting in here
all by your lonesome.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
It's nice out.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
You want something to eat?

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
I just fried some wings.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Nobody turns down my wings.
I'm gonna make you a plate.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
Now if you
Feel that you can't go on

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
Is gone

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
With much confusion

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
Is just an illusion

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
Is tumblin' down

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
-

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
-Come on, baby. Come on.
-

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
That will shelter you

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
Mmm!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
What you waiting for?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Don't feel like eating.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
And I don't feel like wasting
all this good food.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
What, you think I'm supposed
to feel sorry for you?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Well, I don't.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
Do I feel bad?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
But not sorry.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Sometimes, whatever the good
Lord needs to teach us

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
comes in ways we don't see.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
But it doesn't mean

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
we're not supposed
to learn something.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
Look here.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
This was my baby.

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
I'd do anything
for her to be here right now.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
But the Man Above
had another plan for her.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
And whether it seems fair
to me or not,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
it doesn't matter.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Sometimes life isn't fair.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
It's a hard lesson
for folks to learn

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
and most people don't have to
learn it this young.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
But you do.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
You hear me?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Come on now, baby,
you got to eat something.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
You like cake?

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
Well, corn bread
is basically cake.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
Mmm-hmm.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Go on. Try it.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
What's his name?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
It's a she.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Her name is something
you can ponder.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Have you come up with a name
for your mouse yet?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
Uh-huh.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Well, tell me.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Don't be keeping me
in suspense.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Aisy.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Lazy?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Well, that mouse
is full of nothing but energy.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
She runs all the time
in that wheel.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Not "lazy."

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Daisy.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
"Daisy." Oh.

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
I like it.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
That's a perfect name for her.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Close your eyes, honey.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
It's your thing
Do what you wanna do

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
Who to sock it to

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Who to sock it to

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
And somehow, she did it.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
Little by little,

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
with a tug here
and a pull there,

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
she brought me
out of my sadness.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
But even though
my own darkness

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
was being lifted,

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
there was another dark shadow
looming nearby.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
Very nearby.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
I didn't know it,

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
but I was about to meet
my first witch.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
Raymond.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Raymond.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
You call these fresh?

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
But we just got them in.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
When? Last year?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Look at how yellow they are.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
And those brown spots
around the edges.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
I'm not gonna waste
good bacon drippings

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
on these shriveled-up weeds.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
Can you get me
some fresh greens

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
if you don't mind?

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Yes, ma'am.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
I'll see what we have
in the back.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
You do that.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
Grandma, can I get these nails
to make Daisy a house?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Hmm.
-

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Well, these aren't galvanized.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
You have to use
galvanized nails

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
so they won't rust.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
But galvanized costs
.35 cents more.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
Safety first.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Yes, ma'am.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
You cut yourself
on a rusty nail,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
you can get lockjaw.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
Yes, ma'am.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
And then I'd have to
flush out your system

12:48.000 --> 12:49.000
with liver oil, garlic juice,
Tabasco sauce.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
You wouldn't want to go
through that now, would you?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
No, ma'am.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
Good.
Remember, safety first.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Grandma knew how
to fix all kinds of ailments.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
She learned from her grandma
how to use herbs and potions

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
and strange incantations

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
to make sick people
good as new.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
Here in Alabama,
where she grew up,

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Grandma was known as a healer.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
Galvanized.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
Boy.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
Boy.

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
Do you like sweets?

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
She is tame.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
Very sweet.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
Give her a kiss.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Young man.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
You want those nails,
you better come on...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Yes, Raymond,
that's more like it.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Grandma,
I need to tell you something!

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
Not now, son.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
But, Grandma...

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
I thought
you wanted those nails.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Forget it. Let's just go.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Let's just go.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Hey.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Son,

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
what were you
trying to tell me

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
in the grocery store
this morning?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
You were shaking like a leaf.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Don't worry
about that, Grandma.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
I just want
you to feel better.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
I feel fine.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
You just tell me
what you were trying to say.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Looked like you were about
to have a conniption fit.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I don't know what I saw.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
It was a scary lady.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
She called to me.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
But when she did,
when she talked,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
her mouth...

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Was she wearing gloves?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Long ones, up to her elbows?

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Was she wearing a hat?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
It looked like she had a towel
on her head or something.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
And when she talked,

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
did her voice
sound ugly and scratchy

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
like an outhouse door
swinging on a rusty hinge?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I feared this was happening.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
That lady you saw in
the grocery store was no lady.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
What you saw

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
was a witch.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
A witch?

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
That's right.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
A no-good, rotten, low-down,
sneaky, sneaky witch.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Okay. Okay.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Is this you
and your church friends

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
trying to play a joke on me?

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
'Cause if it is,
it's not very funny.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
Listen, child.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
Witches ain't nothing
to joke about.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
I've known children

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
who no longer exist
as children on this earth.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
They were turned,

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
transformed,

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
taken by witches.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
-

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
I can tell you
about Alice Blue.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
Well, Alice Blue and I
were best friends.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.000
We lived across the street
from each other.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
We were like sisters.
Inseparable.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
We did everything together,
even our chores.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
But Alice was a lollygagger.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
It's almost suppertime.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Alice did something
no child should ever do.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
She took candy
from a stranger.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
I got so scared,

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
I tore out of there
like greased lightning,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
and hightailed it
straight home.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
I never should have
left Alice alone.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
I knew I shouldn't have.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
But I was so scared.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
Later that night,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
when I saw Alice alive,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
I was as happy as a mouse
in a bucket of cheese.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
But the very next morning,

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
all that happiness went away

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
because it happened.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
She started turning.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
Alice was chicken-afied.
Chicken-alified.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
Lordy!

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
Look at the size
of that chicken.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Y'all seen
where Alice run off to?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
She's right...

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
there.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
What you
talking about, child?

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
Where'd she go?

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
I tried to explain
what I saw,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
but everybody was looking
at me like I was crazy.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
Finally,
I just shut up about it.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
Although, I made it a point

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
to visit Alice
in her coop every day.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Hi, Alice.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
Alice even laid eggs.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Big green ones.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
Biggest green eggs
I ever seen.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
People said
they were delicious.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
What about the witch?

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
What about her?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Did she go away?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Oh, my, no.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Once a witch come
into your life, it never...

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
Never...

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
Oh, my, Lord in Heaven.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
What am I thinking?

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
I just told you
we saw a witch today.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
A witch in the grocery store.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And what am I doing?
Sitting here

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
like I'm blind in one eye
and can't see out the other,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
wasting precious time
lollygagging.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Always wondered

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
what Grandma kept
in that locked closet.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Turns out it was full of
medicinal herbs and elixirs,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
and old books
about ancient healing.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Now, my mom always said

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
Grandma was sort of
a country-type healer.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
But now
I was starting to think

20:04.000 --> 20:08.000
she might be
a voodoo priestess.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
Child, we need to leave.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
-Leave?
-That's right, leave.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
It's not safe for us here.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
But where we gonna go?

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
I'll call my cousin, Eston.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Have him make
a reservation for us

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
He was the executive chef
there for over 30 years.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
He's got pull there.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
He's a star.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
His cooking
put that hotel on the map.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
It's the swankiest resort
in all of Alabama.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
You'll be telling
your grandkids

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
about your stay in this hotel.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
How do you know
we'll be safe there?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
Because, child,

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
ain't nothing
but rich white folks

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
And witches
only prey on the poor,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
the overlooked,

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
the kids they think

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
nobody's gonna make a fuss
about if they go missing.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Go pack!

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
Grandma, are there
witches in every city?

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Every city,
every state, every country.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
And there's
a secret society of witches

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
in every country
called a coven.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
That's just like a Rotary Club
but for witches.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
They all get together
in one place

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
and gossip about
who they put spells on,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
or trade potion secrets,
and whatnot.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
But most important,

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
they receive orders
from the Grand High Witch.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
The Grand High Witch?

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
The Grand High Witch, yeah.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
She's the ruler of them all.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
All-powerful, pure evil,

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
and without a stitch of mercy.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.000
Yeah. Legend has it,
she was hatched

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
on the frozen tundra
of Norway.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Now, take a look at that.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.000
What, you just
gonna stand there

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
and stare at me all day?

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
Can I help you?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
You can unload this car while
I check in to this here hotel.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Yes, ma'am.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Here's the key.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
Oh, and...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
No.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
You keep your money, ma'am.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
And enjoy yourself.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
I think I will.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
Grandma was right
about this hotel.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
It sure was fancy.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.000
She brought us
to the Gulf of Mexico

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
to get away from that witch.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
But she had no idea what
we were about to step into.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Be careful with the mouse.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
No.
- For God's sake,

22:50.000 --> 22:51.000
I think you're being
extremely unreasonable.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
No, Deidre.
For the last time,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I will not have that woman
in my house.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Oh,
she's very good company.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Absolutely not, Deidre.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Oh, for God's sake,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
Bruno, your face.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
Obviously can't
take you anywhere.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
Here you are, ma'am.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
Come on, we got our key.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.000
We are in room 766.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Sounds like
a good room.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
-You okay, Grandma?
-

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
That's the first time
you coughed

23:27.000 --> 23:28.000
since we left the house.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
-Can I help you, madam?
-

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Oh! You must be
Eston's cousins.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Yes, he insisted
that you stay in room 766.

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
That's the Magnolia.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
This is one of
our most lovely junior suites.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
And aren't you
a lucky fella? Hmm?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
It's not every day

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
that a young gentleman
such as yourself is fortunate

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
to come and stay in such
a fine hotel as this now,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
is it?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Come on, Gatsby.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
Let's go.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Let's go find our room.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
Would you like me to show you?

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
-It's on the fourth floor.
- Mmm.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Grandma,
if we're on the fourth floor,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
why is it number 7-6-6?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Because the man who built
this hotel was a numerologist.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
He believed
numbers have meaning.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I know a little something
about numbers.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
Seven and six together
means a test is coming.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
Two sixes mean abundance.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
So, it look like
a big test might be coming.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
Well, hello there.

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
The Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
welcomes you and your lovely
group of benefactresses.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
Uh, I would just like to say
that we applaud

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
your innumerable,
uh, philanthropic...

24:58.000 --> 25:01.000
-acts and, um...
-

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
And, um...

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm sorry, madam,

25:09.000 --> 25:13.000
but the hotel has
a very strict no-pet policy.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You seem like the sort of man

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
who loves a precious.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.000
Don't you, Mister...

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Stringer. R. J. Stringer III.
Hotel Manager.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Thank you
for making an exception,

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
-Mr. R. J. The Hotel Manager.
-Stringer.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
Yes, but I haven't yet...
But I didn't agree...

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
So, tell me something,
Mister...

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
-Stringy?
-Stringer.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
Hotel man.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
-Manager.
-The third.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
-Yeah.
-I know you love kitties.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
-

25:40.000 --> 25:44.000
But what do you think of...

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
mice?

25:46.000 --> 25:47.000
Mice?

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Yeah. Mice.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
What would you do
if there were mice

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
running all around
in this hotel?

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Well, I can assure you, madam,

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
there would
never be any mice...

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
But if there were?
Hypothetically?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Mmm. Oh, hypothetically.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Yes, I suppose,
well, I would, uh...

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I would call the exterminator.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
Exactly!

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
You see, girls?

26:16.000 --> 26:20.000
He would call
the exterminator!

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
Just like any normal human

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
with his head
screwed on right,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
he would exterminate
those brats.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
Uh... Rats.

26:32.000 --> 26:35.000
We would exterminate the rats.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.000
Evil.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
There's no other way
to describe them.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Pure, unvarnished evil.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
That's what witches are.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
-

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Now, you see
this here cough of mine?

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
It was likely brought on
by a witch.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Probably that one you saw
in the grocery store.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Really? A witch
can make you cough?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh, you bet
your sweet patootie they can.

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
Grandma, how can you tell
a real witch from

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Well, first of all, witches
aren't really women at all.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
They're demons in human shape.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
That's why if you look closely
at a witch,

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
you'll notice the corners
of her mouth is elongated,

27:21.000 --> 27:23.000
stretching almost
up to her ears,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.000
and that's usually hidden
with pancake makeup.

27:26.000 --> 27:30.000
And a real witch always
wears gloves. Always.

27:30.000 --> 27:33.000
Because a real witch
doesn't have hands.

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
She's got claws.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Claws?

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And they don't have toes. Ooh.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
Their ugly feet look like

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
their toes got chopped off
with an axe.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
And all witches are bald.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
As bald as a boiled egg.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
So, they wear wigs.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
And it gives them nasty sores.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
"Wig rash,"
the witches call it.

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Mmm! And it makes them crazy.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
So, gloves,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
wigs.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Is that everything?

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Nose-holes.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
-Nose-holes?
-Yeah. Nostrils.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Nose-holes.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
Witches have larger nose-holes
than normal people.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
When they need
to sniff out a child,

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
those nose-holes can grow out

28:15.000 --> 28:18.000
as big as eight inches
in diameter.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.000
But, mind you, children
smell horrible to witches.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.000
Even if the kid
just had a bath?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
That makes it worse.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
A freshly clean kid smells
like dog poop to a witch.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
-Dog poop?
-That's right.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
And the cleaner the kid,

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
the poopier he smells
to a witch.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.000
Maybe I should
stop taking baths.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Child, don't test me.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Can a witch come in here
and get us while we sleep?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
No.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
Not at all.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
Witches never do
silly things like

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
climbing drainpipes or
breaking into people's houses.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
Besides, they have no idea
where we are.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Okay, but I'm still
a little scared.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Over here, come on,
little man.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
There we go.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.000
Get some sleep.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
Hmm?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Really?

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
Mmm.

30:26.000 --> 30:29.000
-

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
The next morning,

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
the sun was shining
and the air was crisp

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
I kept quiet as a mouse
so Grandma could sleep in,

30:42.000 --> 30:43.000
and I took it upon myself

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
to order her
some room service breakfast.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.000
Here's your breakfast,
Grandma.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Scrambled eggs,
chicken fried steak,

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
hominy grits,
pecan sticky buns,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
rhubarb strawberry jam,

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
and a pitcher
of sweet iced tea with mint.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.000
Oh, that sure smells special.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.000
Oh, mercy, I slept in late.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Phew.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
Well, thank you for ordering
me breakfast, darling.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I gave the room service guy
a half a dollar tip.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Was that okay?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
That's mighty
gentlemanly of you.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Grandma, are you okay?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
I'm fine.
Just a little tickle.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.000
Grab Grandma
that glass of tea.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And listen, Grandma's gonna
take it easy today.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
But I want you to get outside
and run around.

31:33.000 --> 31:37.000
Go down to the water.
Have fun.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
I was thinking I would do
some training with Daisy.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Oh! Well, take her with.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Just don't let her get
too close to the water.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.000
I wouldn't want
some big old sea snake

31:45.000 --> 31:46.000
to grab ahold of her.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Sea snake?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
I'm just joshing.
There ain't no sea snakes.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
You go on now. Have fun.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
And don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.000
Even though I knew

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
Grandma was kidding
about the sea snakes,

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
I didn't wanna
take any chances,

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
so we stayed inside.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
And wouldn't you know,

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
we came upon the big ballroom
where it turns out

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
the International Society

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children folks

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
were gonna have
their conference.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Hey!

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
You there!

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
And what are you doing?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
Breaking and entering?

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
Looking for a quiet spot.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
For what?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Training.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
Training what?

32:34.000 --> 32:37.000
Cool. Super.
What's his name?

32:37.000 --> 32:40.000
It's a she.
And her name is Daisy.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
-Can I hold her?
-

32:42.000 --> 32:46.000
She's not too comfortable
around strangers.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Can she do any tricks
or anything?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
We were just about
to do some training.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Wanna watch?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.000
What time is it?

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
A nice lady told me
to meet her here at 12:25.

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
She said she would give me
six bars of Swiss chocolate.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What's your name?
I'm...

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Bruno Jenkins!

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
I've been looking for you
everywhere, young man.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
Your father is furious.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.000
Hello, Mother.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
This is my new friend.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Nice to meet you.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
Look at your hands,
they're filthy!

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Look at your shirt!
It's a complete mess!

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
-Come with me.
-Ow!

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
What have you been doing?

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
Running around
in a sausage factory?

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
The room
was completely empty.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.000
A perfect place for me
and Daisy to do our training.

33:49.000 --> 33:50.000
And I figured,

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
if all the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children people

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
showed up,

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
they would
probably look kindly

33:56.000 --> 33:57.000
on a young mouse trainer

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
who was just
going about his business.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.000
Jeez, that scared
the crap out of me.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
So, here we are.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Here is the Le Grand
Imperial Ballroom

34:47.000 --> 34:51.000
or Le Salon Grande,
as we call it.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.000
Well, actually
we call it the Mural Room

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
because of all these
beautiful murals...

34:54.000 --> 34:57.000
I was told there is only
one door in and out, yeah?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Yeah. Yes.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
There's, uh, only that door
there, in and out,

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
and which, of course,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
does not make
the fire marshal very happy.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
So, don't you go
starting any fires.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
This room will do.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Right, so...

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Yeah, so, if there's any...
Is there anything else

35:28.000 --> 35:29.000
-that you ladies--
-No.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.000
-No?
-Bye-bye.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Oh, all right.

35:50.000 --> 35:55.000
Saoirse,
secure the room!

36:01.000 --> 36:06.000
Okay, you so-called ladies.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.000
Prepare for removal.

36:26.000 --> 36:29.000
Wake up.
-

37:06.000 --> 37:10.000
Okay, you trussed-up
succubines,

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
you may remove your gloves.

37:20.000 --> 37:25.000
You may remove your shoes.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
And...

37:42.000 --> 37:48.000
you may remove your wigs!

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
They're all witches.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
My blood ran cold

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
as I started
to get real scared.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.000
Here I was,

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
trapped in a room with a bunch
of bald-headed witches!

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
And the mean one,
the bald-head honcho

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
who was standing
right above me,

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
the one who was
giving all the orders,

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
as soon as I got
a good look at her,

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
I knew instantly
who she had to be.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
She's the Grand High Witch.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
Witches.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.000
Witches.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
You are a heap

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
of good-for-nothing worms!

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
This morning,

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I'm having my breakfast

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
and I'm looking out
the window, at the beach,

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
and what am I seeing? Hmm?

39:25.000 --> 39:28.000
What am I seeing?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
I'm seeing dozens...

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
I'm seeing hundreds...

39:32.000 --> 39:36.000
I'm seeing hundreds
of repulsive little brats

39:37.000 --> 39:38.000
playing in the sand,

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
and it's putting me
right off my food!

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
So...

39:53.000 --> 39:56.000
Here are my orders.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
I want every child
in the world...

40:05.000 --> 40:08.000
rubbed out!

40:08.000 --> 40:14.000
Squashed, squirted,
and frittered!

40:14.000 --> 40:18.000
Your Excellency,
do you have a plan?

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
How can we possibly
wipe out every child?

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
That was actually
a good question.

40:36.000 --> 40:40.000
Insubordinate
but a good question.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
Of course I have a plan.

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
I want each of you to return
to your pathetic little town.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
And open...

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
a candy store.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.000
And in this store
you will sell

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
only the highest quality,
tastiest candy.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
Now, you're
probably wondering,

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
"Where do I get the money
to buy a candy shop?"

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Well, I have
thought of that too.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
In my room, room number 666,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
I have a steamer trunk

41:24.000 --> 41:27.000
filled with brand-new,
crisp $100 bills!

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Room 666.

41:29.000 --> 41:34.000
Remember that room number 666

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
and your shops will sell

41:36.000 --> 41:40.000
only the highest quality,
tastiest candy.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
And...

41:48.000 --> 41:51.000
We use Formula Number 86

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Ooh!

41:56.000 --> 42:00.000
One drop of Mouse Maker
in a piece of candy

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
will transform
a dirty little child

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
into a mouse in one hour!

42:07.000 --> 42:08.000
Ah!

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
Two drops

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
will transform the disgusting
little brat in 30 minutes.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
And three drops
is instantaneous.

42:18.000 --> 42:21.000
An instant mouse!

42:24.000 --> 42:25.000
Oh.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
Oh, no, no, no.

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
-

42:36.000 --> 42:37.000
Shut up.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
So,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
less than an hour ago,

42:44.000 --> 42:48.000
I found a repulsive smelly
little boy in the lobby

42:48.000 --> 42:51.000
and I gave him
an outrageously expensive

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
bar of Swiss chocolate.

42:53.000 --> 42:57.000
A chocolate bar
that was laced with one drop

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
-of my Number 86...
-Oh, no.

42:59.000 --> 43:00.000
...Delayed
Action Mouse Maker potion!

43:01.000 --> 43:02.000
Bruno.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
And I told
the greedy little brat

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
to meet me here at 12:25.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
So, in less than 10 minutes,

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
all you pathetic witches will
see what a true genius I am!

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
Genius! Genius! Genius!

43:19.000 --> 43:22.000
-

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Quiet!

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
- Where's my chocolate?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
It's the greedy little cretin.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
-Quick! Put on your wigs!
- Hey, are you in there?

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Welcome, you...

44:28.000 --> 44:31.000
We've been waiting.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Darling boy.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I have your chocolate for you.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
You promised me
six bars of chocolate.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
I only see one in your hand.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Hmm... You see, ladies,

45:01.000 --> 45:06.000
not only is he fat and stupid
but greedy too.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
-Mmm.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.000
That's right, little man.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.000
Here is your
delicious chocolate.

45:24.000 --> 45:28.000
Come and get it.
Come and get it.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.000
Get ready, girls.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Ten seconds.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Give me my chocolate.
Give it to me.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
It's right here, my darling.

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Daisy, what do we do?

45:41.000 --> 45:42.000
Give me.
Give me.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Five seconds.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
Give me my chocolate.
Give it to me.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
Three...

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
-Give me it. Give me. Give me!
- Two...

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
One...

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
-

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Ignition!

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
That smelly brat,

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
that horrid louse

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
has been transformed...

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
She's done it.
She's a genius.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
...into a lovely little mouse!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
What's the big idea?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Where's my chocolate?

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Squish him!

46:52.000 --> 46:53.000
Whoa!

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
-Squish him! Kill him!

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
He's right there.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.000
They turned Bruno
into a mouse

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
and now they're trying
to squish him.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I'll fetch him.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Did you just talk?

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
It's a swarm!

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
They're everywhere!

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Get him.
Where is he? Where is he?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
Gosh! You're a giant.
Why are you so big?

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
I'm not big.
You're little. I'm normal.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
How can I be little?

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
Because you're a mouse.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
A witch put a spell on you.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Witch? What witch?

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Ah-ha! I knew it!

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Dog dropping!

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
Help!
- Grab him.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Help! Help me!
-Hold him down.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
-Flip him. Gag position.
-Help! Help!

48:00.000 --> 48:01.000
Open his trap.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Open it.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Okay.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
That's how you wanna play,

48:07.000 --> 48:12.000
we'll play
the Shakespeare way.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
One drop...

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Two...

48:25.000 --> 48:28.000
Blast off.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
Yes! Yes!

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yes!

49:09.000 --> 49:14.000
Aren't you
a cute little mouse?

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
-Who has the mallet?

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
-Here! Here!
-Get the mallet.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
Where's the mallet?

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I'm not afraid of nothing.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
I have him.
Where's the mallet?

49:28.000 --> 49:32.000
Come on. Give it to me.
Give it to me.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
-

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Run, Bruno, run!

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
So, you're a mouse too?

49:40.000 --> 49:43.000
-Now I've got you.
-

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Four legs, Bruno.

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
Four legs.

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Rats! A dead end!

50:02.000 --> 50:05.000
Run, Bruno, run!

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
No!

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
Ow, my back.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
What happened to us?

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
Why are we mouses?

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
"Mice."
-Whatever.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
There's a convention of
witches here in the hotel,

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
and they have an evil potion.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
They put it in your chocolate.

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
My chocolate? Crikey!

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
They always spike
the chocolate.

50:42.000 --> 50:45.000
It's standard
evil witch procedure.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Wait. You were a kid too?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.000
A girl.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Do I look like
a baby goat to you?

50:53.000 --> 50:54.000
Nope, a mouse.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
What are we going to do?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
I don't want to be a mouse.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
I like being
a portly little kid.

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
"Child."

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Whatever.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
All right,
we have to find my grandma.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
She knows
everything about witches.

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
She'll know what to do.
Come on.

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Two crab salads.
What are you doing?

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Wow, look at
all that lovely food.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
Okay, here's what we do.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.000
You see that vent?

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
I bet that'll get us
to the lobby. Let's go.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Pick that up.
That's white truffle.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
You have any idea
how much white truffle costs?

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
Wipe it off
and put it in the sauce.

51:31.000 --> 51:34.000
What is this?
You call that puffed?

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
Let's get some more hands
in here.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
So, now what?

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Look, all we need to do is
make our way to the elevator,

51:49.000 --> 51:50.000
then up to the fourth floor.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
Come on.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.000
Hey, a little help.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Crikey.

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
-Hurry up.
-This way.

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
I just realized
something, y'all.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
How exactly do we
reach the button

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
-Floor?
-Four, please.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Come on.

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
There's my room, 766.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
This way.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
She's never
going to hear us.

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
A doorbell.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Come on.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.000
Crikey!

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
All right.
We make a human ladder.

53:40.000 --> 53:41.000
You mean a mouse ladder?

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Right, a mouse ladder.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Ow! Ow.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
I got... I got...

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
-I got it!
-

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
-

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
Help me!

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Ahhh, great balls of fire,
don't let me fall!

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Phew.
-Follow me, boys.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Mice!

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
They everywhere!

54:53.000 --> 54:54.000
Grandma, it's me.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Grandma, it's me,
your grandson.

54:57.000 --> 54:58.000
My grandson...

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
Is that you, boy?

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
Yes, Grandma, it's me.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Oh... Oh.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.000
Is it really you?

55:07.000 --> 55:08.000
It's really me.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
-What happened?
-It was the Grand High Witch.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.000
The Grand High Witch?

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Oh, Lord,
not the Grand High Witch.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.000
Yes. She mouse-afied me.

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
And the whole hotel
is full of witches.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
They're having a witch
convention or something.

55:19.000 --> 55:22.000
You been through so much,
you don't need this.

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
Grandma's so, so sorry.

55:24.000 --> 55:25.000
Grandma,
please get off the floor

55:25.000 --> 55:28.000
and put me
on the coffee table.

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
-How do I do that?
-Pick me up.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.000
Pick you up?

55:31.000 --> 55:32.000
Yeah, just like
I pick up Daisy.

55:34.000 --> 55:35.000
Right.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
I can't believe
this happened to you.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
Believe me,
things could be a lot worse.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
They could?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
Oh, Grandma,
by the way,

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
this is my friend,
Bruno Jenkins.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
He's now a mouse too,

55:53.000 --> 55:54.000
but he used to be
a chubby, little English kid.

55:54.000 --> 55:58.000
You could've just stopped at,
"This is my friend, Bruno."

55:58.000 --> 55:59.000
I'm so sorry, Bruno.

55:59.000 --> 56:02.000
Those nasty, evil witches
got you too, huh?

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Yes. They got me good
and proper.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
It's been an awful day.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
-Anybody else hungry?
-Ahem!

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Oh, and Daisy used to be
a kid... A girl too.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Why didn't you
say something before, darling?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Because it can be
very dangerous

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
for a mouse to talk.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.000
Most people don't understand
and they get scared.

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
I almost said something
the other night

56:22.000 --> 56:23.000
when you told the story

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
about Alice Blue
getting turned into a chicken,

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
but I thought better of it.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
So, some wicked, evil witch
mouse-afied you.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Yes, ma'am, four months ago.

56:32.000 --> 56:36.000
On the very same afternoon
I ran away from the orphanage.

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
Well, what happened was,
a kind lady...

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
Well, I thought she was kind.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
Anyway, she offered me
a chocolate bar,

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
and before I knew it, poof!

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I was transformed.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Then, faster than a hot knife
cuts through butter,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
a panhandler scoops me up
and sells me to a pet store

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
so he could buy food.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Yum!

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I'm so sorry, Daisy.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Mary. Uh, my real name
is Mary.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.000
Mary. That's a pretty name.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.000
Excuse me.

57:03.000 --> 57:06.000
All this talk about food
is making me really hungry.

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Can I have
one of those grapes?

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
So, it was
the Grand High Witch,

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
and she's in this very hotel?

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
We got to do something to turn
you back. Make this right.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
The Grand High Witch
has a room full of potion.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.000
And she's gonna use it

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
to turn every kid in the world
into a mouse.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
We have to help them.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
-

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
-Who is it?
- Hotel maintenance.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
Quick, hide.

57:33.000 --> 57:36.000
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Keep your heads down.

57:46.000 --> 57:47.000
Yes.

57:47.000 --> 57:48.000
I'm sorry to
bother you, ma'am,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
but we got a report of
a possible rodent infestation.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
Rodent infestation?
In a hotel this expensive?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
That's crazier than
a hog on slaughter day.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
Yes, ma'am.
It's probably nothing.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
The maid who said
she saw the rodents

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
-Mmm.
-But, to be on the safe side,

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
I thought
I'd lay these here traps,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
-if you don't mind.
-Okay.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
-We put them in all the rooms.
-Mmm-hmm.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Just to be safe.

58:10.000 --> 58:14.000
So, uh, what are they? Mice?

58:14.000 --> 58:15.000
Oh. No, ma'am.

58:15.000 --> 58:18.000
Maid said she saw
a swarm of huge, ugly rats.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
At least a dozen of them.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.000
Goodness, a dozen?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Well, it's like I said,

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
she has a tendency to be
a bit high-strung.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Fresh Wisconsin cheddar.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Drives them rodents
plumb crazy.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
They can't resist it.

58:43.000 --> 58:46.000
Anyway, you hear any
of these traps start snapping,

58:46.000 --> 58:47.000
give me a call.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
I sure will.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.000
That's right.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.000
Don't you know anything?
Grapes can hurt a mouse.

58:53.000 --> 58:54.000
All right, you three.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
You stay away from
those traps, you hear?

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
If we could just get our hands
on some of that potion,

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
I might be able
to reverse-engineer it.

59:01.000 --> 59:04.000
Make it a potion
that turns mice into children.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
I always travel with
my anti-hex herbs and salts.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
But whoever knows where
that wicked, evil witch is.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
We do. She's in room 666.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
We heard her tell
all those witches

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
to meet her in room 666
right after dinner.

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
And we're in room 766.

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
Room 666 is right below us.

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Good Lord!

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
That evil sorceress is living
right beneath us?

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
Yes. And here's what we do.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
We wait for the Grand High
Witch to leave her room,

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
then we use
Grandma's knitting wool

59:30.000 --> 59:31.000
as a rope to lower me down

59:32.000 --> 59:33.000
to the Grand High Witch's
balcony.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.000
I grab a bottle of potion,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Grandma hoists me back up,
she reverses the spell,

59:37.000 --> 59:40.000
and ta-da!
We're kids again.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
Young man, you think
all that up just now?

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Popped right into my head.

59:46.000 --> 59:49.000
-

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
Vile, filthy brats.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You make me puke!

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Hades,

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
it's getting so bad,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
I can't even enjoy
a glass of wormwood.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
She's the Grand High Witch,
all right.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
-

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Grandma, that's the potion.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
She's keeping it on ice.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Yeah, it's exactly
what we need.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Hades, come.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000
-We are late for tea.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Teatime. Perfect.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Now look, all we need
is one bottle of potion.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
So, grab one as fast
as you can and hurry on back.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000
No telling when that monster
is fixing to return.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
I know you're
likely scared, baby.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
I'm not scared, Grandma.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I don't know why,

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
but ever since I was turned
into a small mouse,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
little things
don't scare me anymore.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Okay. Hold on tight.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I can't believe

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
they won't let my precious
into the dining room.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
This fleabag, roach-trap hotel

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.000
discriminates
against everything.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Money.
Money, money, money.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Oh, Hades,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000
why, in this disgusting
human world,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
do you need money
for everything?

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Disgusting, filthy lucre.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
He's ready.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Well, well, well, well.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Why is this wool here,
I wonder?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Hello.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I just dropped my knitting
over the balcony.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.000
But it's all right.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Thank goodness I still have
a hold of it on this end.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Well, I'm just gonna
go ahead on and...

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
And pull it on up.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
I'll be out of your way.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
-Let go.
-

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I know you.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Me?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
I don't think so.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I have seen you before.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000
I remember your face.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
You mighta seen me
in the lobby, maybe.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Not in the lobby.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
I remember you from...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
- What? Who is it?

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
It's Mr. Stringer III,

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Hotel Manager.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Curses!

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
You want me to remove

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
the children from the beach?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I want them removed.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Well, I'll...
I'll see what I can do.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Madam, I procured this,
uh, for you today.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I thought you might like it.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It's a kitty carrier.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
And I thought

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
you could put your feline
friend in there and you can

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
transport him
all over the hotel,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
including the dining room.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Thought you might like that.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Well,

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.000
let me tell you something,
Mister Cat-Cage-Procurer.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I will never, ever

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
allow my precious puss
to be...

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Well, look at that.
He likes it in there.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Oh, madam, I almost forgot.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Regarding your ladies' dinner
this evening,

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000
we have neglected
to select a soup.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Now, there are two choices.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.000
One is our
Cajun spice crab Creole,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
and the other one is our
plantation kitchen split pea.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Which one is cheaper?

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Well, madam,
I'm sure you will appreciate

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
that the crab is fresh
and it is...

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Which one?
-

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Plantation kitchen split pea.
That's the one.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Then we will have
the split pea soup.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Yes, madam.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.000
no garlic in the soup.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
No what?

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Garlic.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
No garlic?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Did I stutter?

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
No garlic.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
My women,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
all suffer from a selective
food avoidance disorder.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Picky eaters.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Yes, madam.
As you wish.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
I will inform the chef.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
You do that.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I'll let myself out.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
You do that.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Well, my precious,

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
since you enjoy being
in that cage so much,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
-you can stay in it!
-

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Traitor!

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Mouse Maker potion.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
A drop of hyssop...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
A smidgen of mugwort...

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
And now,

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
a dash of healing water,
straight from Lourdes.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000
This is the most powerful
healing water there is.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Okay.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Now let's all join hands
and bow our heads.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Well, I'll be...

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Not much more to say
than that.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
We had to try something, kids.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
This witch's power

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
is far greater
than my little home remedies.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Evil power.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
And strong.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Much stronger than me.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Please don't cry, Grandma.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
It'll be okay.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000
I'm sorry, children.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
It's not your fault, Grandma.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Sometimes things just happen.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Yeah, they do.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I actually don't mind
being a mouse.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.000
I get to hang out
with my new friends all day,

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
don't have to go
to school anymore,

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
and I don't have to learn
how to drive,

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
which means I'll never
get into an accident.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Oh, child.
Come here.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Grandma, will you still
take care of me?

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Even if I stay a mouse?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Of course
I will, darling.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Doesn't matter who you are

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
or what you look like,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
so long as somebody loves you.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And I always will.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
What about my friends?

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Can they stay too?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Well, of course.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
If they want to,

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
but don't forget,
they all have loved ones

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
I'm not so sure about that.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Don't be a fool.
I'm sure they love you.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
My mother thinks I'm clumsy,

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
and my father complains
that I'm always hungry.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Well, maybe this will
help them love you

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
for who you are,
not for who you ain't.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:17.000
You're fortunate
to have parents, Bruno.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Some of us don't.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
But we're gonna be okay.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
We have Grandma.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And she'll
always be our family.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
And for that
we are very blessed.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But what I wanna know

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
is why are we standing
around here lollygagging?

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000
How are we gonna stop
those horrible witches

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
from turning
more children into mice?

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
She's right.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
We got to do something.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I know what we'll do.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
I sneak into the kitchen with
the Number 86 Mouse Maker,

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
then I slip the potion
into the witches' pea soup

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
and turn them all into mice.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Are you sure about this,
little man?

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
This sounds like
it could be a very dangerous

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
and scary mission.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
Trust me, Grandma,
I can handle it.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I'll meet you
in the lobby bar.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Bruno and Daisy
know which vent.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Be careful, darling.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I will, Grandma.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Hurry up there!

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
The pea soup is ready.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000
No garlic.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I got the soup,
no garlic, Chef,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.000
coming right up.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Where are my prawns?

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
This is not a prawn,
this is a shrimp.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
You don't know the difference
between a shrimp and a prawn?

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Count the pincers.
Un, deux.  One, two.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Let's start ladling out
that soup.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Come on, you people.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
- Yes, Chef.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
What are you doing, huh?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
I'm getting
the prawns ready.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Don't tell me
that's a prawn.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
-I'm a crustacean expert.
- This is a prawn.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I've been
sauteing prawns for 30 years

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
and I only use butter.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Only butter?
- Never oil.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
I don't give a damn
about what nutritionists say.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
They are
the ruination of cuisine.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Always butter,
butter only.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Where are my prawns?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Who do I have to get
some prawns around here?

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Let's start
ladling out that soup.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yes, Chef.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Are you crying?

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000
There's no crying
in my kitchen.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Chef, this soup
needs some garlic.

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Absolutely no garlic.
Stringer's orders.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Grease fire.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
We got fire
blankets under those sinks.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Are those my prawns
that just exploded?

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Forget the prawn, just throw
some shrimp in there.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
-You idiots don't know how...
-

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Someone get me a sharp knife
so that I can kill myself.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Somebody call an exterminator.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Look, there's my mother
and father.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
That's your mother and father?

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
As I live and breathe.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Bruno, I think it's time
to say hello to your parents.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Are you mad?
Right here in the bar?

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
There's no time
like the present.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Excuse me,
are you Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Can we help you?

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000
I'm afraid I have some,

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
well, strange news
about your son, Bruno.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
What about Bruno?
Where is he?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Maybe we can go somewhere
a bit more private.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Private?
Why do we have to be private?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
It's not an easy thing
for him to explain.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
He'd be much more comfortable
we all went up to your room.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
No, no, look here, madam,

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
I'm perfectly comfortable
exactly where I am.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
So, either you tell me
where I can find Bruno

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:36.000
or you just
leave us alone now.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000
Well...

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
-got him right here.
-

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000
That's a mouse! A mouse!

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
What in God's name
is wrong with you?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Get that filthy rodent
out of here!

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
No, no, no, no. This is Bruno.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
-Bruno, say something to them.
-

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
"Say something"?
Are you insane?

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Get away from us
before I call the manager.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Quit all this hollering.
This is your son, Bruno.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Manager! Someone get me
the manager.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
This woman has just scared
my wife half to death.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
She's walking around
with rats in her handbag.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Bruno, why didn't
you say something?

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000
My father hates it when I talk
with my mouth full.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Psst! Grandma.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Down here.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.000
There you are.
Thank the Lord.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
So, how'd it go?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Soup is on.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Look! The pea soup.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Here we are,
garlic free.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
Excuse me, madam,
may I have a word with you?

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Please, this way.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Just over here.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Um...

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
You wouldn't happen
to be carrying around a mouse

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
on your person now, would you?

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
-A mouse?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Why on earth would I
be carrying around a mouse?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Does this have anything to do
with all the rat traps

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000
being set up
all over this hotel?

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Rat traps?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Is this your pathetic idea
of a smoke screen?

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Accusing your guests
of carrying around mice

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000
to hide the fact that this
hotel has a mouse infestation.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Shh. No... Shh. What?

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I'll tell you this.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000
For what this hotel
is costing me,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
I better not see
a single mouse.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Not even a tiny, cute one.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Yes, madam. I'm so...

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
My mistake. I'm sorry.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Luther.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Would you please show
this lady to our finest table?

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Certainly.
This way.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Apologies, madam,

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
-I, it's just...
- Mmm.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Our finest table, madam.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Oh, uh, thank you, Luther.
I'm sure

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
your finest table
in this lovely establishment

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
is this one right here
next to the kitchen.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I always prefer
a table near the exit

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
so I can get out fast.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
-Of course.
- Mmm.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Check it out.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
They love the soup.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Have you decided?

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
Uh, yes, I think
I'll have the jambalaya.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Excellent. And would you like
something to start?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000
Mmm...

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Well, that pea soup

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
those fancy ladies are eating
looks good.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
I'll have that.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
I'm sorry.
That soup is reserved

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
strictly for that group
of lady guests only.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
If I may,

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000
that large party suffers
from a severe garlic allergy.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000
So, they have requested their
soup be prepared garlic free.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It is very bland.
Practically inedible.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I see.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000
That sounds disgusting.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000
May I suggest
the Cajun spice crab Creole?

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
It's one
of our signature dishes.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
Uh, sounds...

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
Yes?

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Uh, the... The shrimp Creole
will be fine.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
You mean
the crab Creole?

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Very good.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Keep your heads down,
we got company.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000
Pigtails.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000
I'm sorry?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Pigtails.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:05.000
You wore pigtails.

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Do I know you?

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Many years ago,
in a shabby little town.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000
A shabby little town

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
right here in Alabama.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000
You wore pigtails.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
And you got away from me.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Remember?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
But I got

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:34.000
that horrid little friend
of yours.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000
Remember...

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
-Quick, mouse ladder.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It was you.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
You were the filthy witch
who turned Alice.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Aw...

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
-That's a nasty...
-

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
-

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
-

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
What are you doing?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
-

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Grandma, look.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Attaboy.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
-High five, baby!

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Mmm-hmm! That's some
serious ratification.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Oh, my God!
It's on my leg!

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.000
Ooh. Lordy,
hell's a-poppin'.

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Come here,
you nasty critter...

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Get it off!
Get it off!

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000
-Get it off!
-

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Come on, kids.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.000
It's time to skedaddle.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Somebody call
the exterminator!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Good job.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Ooh, ooh...

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Look at all this potion.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Kids, we got
to grab every bottle.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Hey, Grandma, what about him?

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
I'll call the manager to let
him out once we out of here.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Oh, I dropped some.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
I'll get it, Grandma.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Whoa, that cheese
smells awfully good.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
-

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
Look what you made me do.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
You think you're so clever,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
breaking into my room
with a stolen key?

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:33.000
But everyone knows they keep
a spare key at the front desk.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:36.000
We'll never let you get away
with your filthy, evil plot.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Oh, no?
Who's gonna stop me?

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000
A feeble, stupid,

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
-sick woman like you?
-

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Oh, you think that's funny?

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Not that.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
See, I was just thinking.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000
Pretty soon, you not gonna
be able to do much of nothing.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And why is that, brave,
little, soon-to-be-dead woman?

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
The pea soup.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000
The pea soup...

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
No... No...

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
You stupid fool.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
I did not drink the pea soup.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000
If you recall,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I was interrupted.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
Okay,
here's what we're gonna do.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Well, well, well.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Let me see.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000
I think

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I will reach into your chest

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
and rip out your withered,

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
shriveled heart,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:00.000
and squeeze it
until it bursts.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
All your butt-ugly witch-talk
don't scare me one bit.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
It should,

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000
considering the last thing
you will ever see

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000
is my snickering face.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000
I believe

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
with every fiber
of my being...

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000
that in the end,

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000
love will always triumph
over hatred and evil.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Is that so?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000
You may have turned
Alice and my grandson,

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000
but I will make sure
you never turn another child.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
So help me, God.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:39.000
Now!

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
-

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
-

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
-

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You stupid rat.
-

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Look what you've done.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
-Run!

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Look what you've done.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
You stupid rodents.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Get back here!

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
You filthy pests.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
-Yum.
-Parasites.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Kid, I'm gonna get you,

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000
you putrid varmints.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
-

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Now I've got you!

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
What?

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I'm done listening
to your trash talk.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.000
What is this?

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
You fool.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
Let me out.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
-Let me out!

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Let me out! Let me out!

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I will rip out your tongues.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Stupid mice.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
The witch in a bottle...

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Let me out.
-Witch in a bottle...

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Let me out
of this stupid fish bowl.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Hey, Grandma, this is the key
to that big trunk.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
That's my key.
That's my key.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
That's my key,
you pea-brain brat.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
-You pea-brain parasites.
-Come on, guys.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Put your tongue
back in your mouth,

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.000
you filthy sewer guttersnipes.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
What are you doing?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000
What are you doing?
That is mine.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Ooh!
-That's mine.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000
You idiots. You scoundrels.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
That is a lot of bacon.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
-Lettuce.
-Dough.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Hey, you're making me
terribly hungry.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000
No, get your hands off
of that, that's mine!

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000
Get your filthy paws
off my filthy lucre.

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:45.000
I'll poke out your beady eyes.
What are you looking at?

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.000
What's that, Grandma?

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000
It's a list of names
and addresses

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:52.000
of every witch in the world.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000
Wow!

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000
With that list and that money
and all this potion,

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
we could turn every witch
in the world into rats.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Excellent!

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I'll cut off your tails

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
with rusty scissors.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:08.000
I'll clip your ears
with toenail clippers.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
I'll poke out your beady eyes.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
I'll get you for this!

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
All right,
kiddies, one hop.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:19.000
-We got work to do.
-

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I almost forgot.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.000
No, no, no, don't do that.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
What are you doing?

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
Hades.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Good pussy.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000
-You are a good pussy cat.
-

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Nice kitty.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
-You two have fun now.
-Nice kitty.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Ah, you stupid,
mangy fleabag. Precious.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Put the books back.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Stay back,
you stupid, precious...

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
No! Hades.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Hades, precious,
remember who feeds you.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:01.000
No, don't think about food.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.000
-

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
-

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
Grandma, you hear that?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
-I didn't hear a thing.
-

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Oh! Well, thank you kindly.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:24.000
And one for you.

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:26.000
The next morning,

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
we were feeling joyful
and triumphant.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
As a matter of fact,
Grandma was so happy,

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
she was spreading her joy
to the entire hotel staff.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Thank you kindly
for everything.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
One for you.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
And one for you.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Thank you, ma'am.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Bruno tried to explain

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
the situation to his mom.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Hello, Mother.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I'm now a mouse.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000
It's a mouse!
-  But it turned out

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins
weren't really mouse people.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
So, we decided
it would be best

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000
if Bruno came to stay with me,
Grandma, and Daisy.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
Faster, faster!

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
Here we go!

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Whee!

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.000
-Cool!
-Whoo-hoo!

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:50.000
How's my hair look?
How's my hair?

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.000
-Let's go again, y'all.
-

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
This time
I sit in the front.

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Grandma, I love being a mouse.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Oh, I believe you do.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000
But you wanna know
something weird?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
I still feel just like a boy.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000
But you are, darling.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Life changes all of us.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000
I mean, look at me.

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
I'm getting on up
in the years,

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:17.000
but I still feel like a girl.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
And I still feel like a boy.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:21.000
See?

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000
You get it.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
Never give up
what you are inside.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:30.000
When I look at you, I don't
see whiskers and a pink nose.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000
I just see your eyes.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Bright and beautiful.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000
Grandma,

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
how long does a mouse live?

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Oh, an ordinary mouse
only lives about three years,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
but you're no ordinary mouse.
You're a mouse-person,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.000
and a mouse-person
will almost certainly live

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
Maybe even longer.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000
That's great news.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I couldn't stand being
looked after by anybody else.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000
I'll be a very old mouse

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000
and you'll be
a very old grandmother,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.000
and we'll both die together.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000
With a little luck, darling.

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But no one knows how long
their time is on this earth.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
Only God knows that answer.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
And that is
the natural order of things.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
Daisy, Bruno, and I

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
loved living with Grandma.

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.000
We were one big, happy family.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Where were we?
Oh, yeah. That's right.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.000
So, here we are,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.000
ready to carry on the fight.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.000
Carry on the fight!

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
Over the years, we have turned
and mouse-afied

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.000
every damnable witch
in these United States.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So, we are gathered here
to take our battle

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
to the entire world.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
-You have your names, correct?
- Yes, sir.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Your addresses?

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Yes, sir.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And your Number 86
Mouse Maker potion?

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:13.000
Yes, sir. Number 86
Mouse Maker potion, sir.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Let's get out there

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
and give those witches
a taste of their own medicine.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
So, you ready for this
mission, old-timer?

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000
Grandma,
I've never been more ready.
