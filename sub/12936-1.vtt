- <i>[ Captain Laughs ]</i>

01:34:14.514 --> 01:34:18.585
Ah, me princess!
You really are the bestest pop
in the whole world.

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:23.423
Bye! See you
in 50 years!

<i> No apologies to anyone</i>

01:34:28.662 --> 01:34:32.799
- <i> We live on the seas </i>
- At least she'll be
  taken care of by her father.

01:34:32.866 --> 01:34:36.570
We forget that
she's just a little girl.
Helpless, really.

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:40.107
Helpless?
Pippi?

01:34:45.145 --> 01:34:47.748
May I borrow that,
please, Papa?

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:50.917
Thanks.

01:35:03.397 --> 01:35:08.268
You know, Papa,
there was a lot of nice people
I forgot to say good-bye to.

Well, then,
open up your lungs
and shout.

as that.

01:35:13.573 --> 01:35:16.109
Here.

01:35:16.176 --> 01:35:19.146
I wanted to try
a couple new things.

01:35:21.848 --> 01:35:24.484
Maybe even go to school.

01:35:24.551 --> 01:35:26.887
School, eh?

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:33.527
Well, now.
It's your decision.

01:35:33.593 --> 01:35:37.030
I wanna be with you more
than just about anything.

to be a princess.

I'll miss you lots.

01:35:52.346 --> 01:35:56.616
But in my heart,
I know it's best for a child
to have an orderly life.

01:35:56.683 --> 01:35:59.553
Especially if that child
can order it herself.

01:35:59.619 --> 01:36:02.456
Yes.

01:36:02.522 --> 01:36:05.325
