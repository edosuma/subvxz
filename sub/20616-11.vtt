WEBVTT

00:10.277 --> 00:13.412
The house just feels bad.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.215
I hear a dangerous telepath.

00:16.216 --> 00:17.950
And they think it's
physically attacked.

00:17.952 --> 00:19.551
He can't breathe.
He's hyperventilating.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.920
He's freaking out.

00:21.922 --> 00:25.524
I heard him yell out,
"Leave me alone."

00:25.526 --> 00:26.725
We have reports
of him threatening

00:26.727 --> 00:28.160
to kill anyone
who approached him.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.828
And I feel bad for the kid.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.964
No wonder he's all...up.

00:31.966 --> 00:36.935
So I don't know if this
person is insane or a sensitive.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.138
This is not a good situation.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.206
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.208 --> 00:42.574
There's death here.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.443
Don't want to go down there.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.844
I see dead people.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.880
They hide in the walls,
and they watch.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.649
I speak to dead people...

00:50.651 --> 00:53.185
She's definitely
a serial killer.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.853
And they speak to me.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.489
She's going to torture them.

00:57.491 --> 01:00.993
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:00.995 --> 01:03.061
They were all murdered.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.663
I rely on my partner.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.165
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.100
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective...

01:08.102 --> 01:10.569
So is this the only time
you've been physically attacked?

01:10.571 --> 01:14.606
And I know every person,
every house, has secrets.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.310
There's no question in my mind
that he was talking about Satan.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.245
It's my job to reveal them.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.780
Who do you think possessed you?

01:21.782 --> 01:23.615
But Steve and I never speak...

01:23.617 --> 01:25.717
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.952
Until the very end.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.520
Well, you're not going
to want to see this.

01:28.522 --> 01:30.989
What we uncover is if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:30.991 --> 01:32.391
Hell no.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.759
Or time to get out.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.428
Everyone is in jeopardy.

01:51.846 --> 01:53.479
I'm in Waterford, Connecticut,

01:53.481 --> 01:55.447
about 50 miles
south of Hartford.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.015
I got a call from a woman
named Linda.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.151
Now, she sounded really bad.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.054
Told me whatever is in the house
broke up her marriage,

02:02.056 --> 02:04.122
and now it's torturing
one of her kids.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.824
She told me she's
barely hanging on,

02:05.826 --> 02:07.626
and we are her very last hope.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.564
Before Amy arrives,

02:12.566 --> 02:15.767
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:15.769 --> 02:22.074
Photographs, personal items
and even religious symbols

02:22.076 --> 02:25.577
have to be covered or removed.

02:25.579 --> 02:27.913
When I'm finished,
tonight's walk can begin.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.895
I don't feel good.

02:42.897 --> 02:45.564
Somebody here

02:45.566 --> 02:51.069
is making me
excruciatingly sick.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.106
I seriously want to vomit.

02:54.108 --> 03:00.913
It feels like it's a male
who's very angry.

03:00.915 --> 03:03.615
We might have to go to the
hospital, like, right now.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.493
So, Linda, when we spoke
on the phone

03:14.495 --> 03:15.661
you sounded terrified.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.930
There's something
really bad here, evil,

03:17.932 --> 03:21.567
terrorizing my family,
ripping us apart.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.168
How long have you been
living here?

03:23.170 --> 03:27.172
I inherited from my father,
and we moved in 2009.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.041
What did he pass from,
if you don't mind me asking?

03:29.043 --> 03:31.343
He never told us
what he passed away from,

03:31.345 --> 03:34.880
but the death
certificate said cancer.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.982
That's the kind
of person he was,

03:36.984 --> 03:38.817
just kept things to himself.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.385
Did he die in the house?
No, he didn't.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.887
He died in a hospital.
Okay.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.323
Was he sick while
he was living here?

03:44.325 --> 03:45.691
Yes, he was.

03:45.693 --> 03:46.925
You know, he doesn't sound
like much of a talker,

03:46.927 --> 03:49.595
but do you know if he had
an experiences here?

03:49.597 --> 03:52.297
He did mention he would
hear footsteps,

03:52.299 --> 03:55.567
people walking around,
jiggling door handles.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.371
I wrote it off as him, maybe,
going a little senile.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.406
Now, Linda, do you have
any knowledge

04:01.408 --> 04:02.874
of the history of
this house or anything?

04:02.876 --> 04:06.311
The only thing that I was that
somebody had committed suicide

04:06.313 --> 04:08.647
in the basement
and hung themselves.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.182
Well, I'll look into that.
Okay.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.818
So, Linda, who exactly
lives in the house?

04:12.820 --> 04:15.821
Well, here's a picture.

04:15.823 --> 04:19.925
It's my husband,
me and younger son,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.260
Eric, and I have
an older son, Nathan,

04:22.262 --> 04:25.030
who lives here that doesn't want
to be part of this at all.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.532
What do you mean doesn't want
to be of, of this investigation?

04:27.534 --> 04:28.734
Yeah.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.902
He's bothered too much
by what's here.

04:30.904 --> 04:33.505
He just doesn't want
to be involved in it.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.540
I don't know how good
this investigation can go

04:35.542 --> 04:37.542
without me knowing
everything I can

04:37.544 --> 04:38.910
with him not talking to me.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.512
Yeah.
I feel helpless.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.280
I don't know what to do.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.017
So, Linda, give me an idea what
you guys are experiencing here.

04:45.019 --> 04:50.789
Well, we've been experiencing
growling, mood swings,

04:50.791 --> 04:55.093
our health is getting bad
and physical attacks.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.695
Tell me more about the sickness.

04:56.697 --> 04:57.796
What's going on with that?

04:57.798 --> 05:02.534
Chest pains, nausea,
trouble breathing.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.870
Now, you said the house
causes mood swings.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.672
We argue a lot.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.408
Things have gotten so bad
between Robie and I

05:09.410 --> 05:12.310
that he had moved out
6 months ago.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.912
His moods changed.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.647
I've changed.

05:15.649 --> 05:18.050
You know, nobody
got along anymore.

05:18.052 --> 05:20.719
Relationships, they go bad,
so I don't know

05:20.721 --> 05:22.020
if that's a problem
with the house

05:22.022 --> 05:23.288
or if it's personal.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.224
How was Robie before
you guys moved in here?

05:26.226 --> 05:28.627
He was fun to be around.

05:28.629 --> 05:32.130
We come here and he's, like,
doesn't want to talk

05:32.132 --> 05:34.633
and just, kind of, moody and...

05:34.635 --> 05:35.734
What about you?

05:35.736 --> 05:37.202
How were you before
you moved in here?

05:37.204 --> 05:40.439
I was a happy-go-lucky
person, and I come in here,

05:40.441 --> 05:42.407
and now I'm, like, miserable.

05:42.409 --> 05:43.709
I've got to be blunt.
I got to ask you.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.177
Why don't you just get
the hell out of here?

05:45.179 --> 05:48.080
I'm a little stubborn.
It's my house.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.115
I'm hoping that we can
correct the problem

05:50.117 --> 05:53.051
and get rid of what's here
and live a normal life,

05:53.053 --> 05:56.755
and live a peaceful life
with no arguing, fighting,

05:56.757 --> 06:00.292
or anything else that goes along
with what's in this house.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.034
The guy who is making me sick,

06:09.036 --> 06:15.941
it's like his energy
fills the walls.

06:15.943 --> 06:19.678
He's so, almost,
a part of the house.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.114
To me, I don't know how anybody
could be in here without,

06:22.116 --> 06:23.782
like, just vomiting.

06:23.784 --> 06:27.953
And it's not only his horrible,
horrible anger issue,

06:27.955 --> 06:30.822
but also his sickness.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.161
It's, like, embedded in
the walls,

06:36.163 --> 06:39.464
and really thick.

06:39.466 --> 06:41.833
The house just feels bad.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.475
Okay.
So Nathan sleeps here?

06:50.477 --> 06:52.878
Yes.
Which bed does he sleep in?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.112
Top.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.747
The bottom is supposed
to be for the dog,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.048
but he won't come in.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.216
Interesting.
Okay.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.519
So now, since Nathan
won't talk to me,

07:00.521 --> 07:02.988
can you describe to me
what he's experiencing?

07:02.990 --> 07:06.324
Well, he's experienced
growling and howling.

07:06.326 --> 07:09.127
Where?
The basement.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.328
Now, have you heard this, too?

07:10.330 --> 07:11.663
I've heard the howling.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.998
How's the howling sound
to you?

07:13.000 --> 07:14.099
Does it sound like an animal?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.801
The animal
I've never heard before.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.169
You've got woods back here.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.104
Are you sure it wasn't an animal
that got into the house?

07:19.106 --> 07:22.574
No. No.
Okay. What else?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.576
Nathan gets physically
attacked a lot.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.478
Okay.
Describe some of them for me.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.914
He feels stabbing pains
in his legs

07:28.916 --> 07:30.448
and his neck and in his back,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.685
and then he's been in the shower
and he's been pushed.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.886
Okay.
Anything else?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.389
Just that he sees
this little creature

07:37.391 --> 07:38.657
hopping down the hallway

07:38.659 --> 07:41.893
and then squatting in
his room tormenting him.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.669
My God!

07:50.671 --> 07:52.370
I'm seeing all kinds
of crazy...

07:52.372 --> 07:55.273
going down on the bed.

07:55.275 --> 07:59.277
What I'm seeing,
it's predator looking.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.613
So it comes up and it
slithers along,

08:01.615 --> 08:04.115
and then it's got arms
when it goes down.

08:06.587 --> 08:10.522
It kind of reminds me
of those weird jellyfish things.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.757
This thing has a face.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.926
More human looking, I think.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.330
It's always changing its face.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.065
I don't even know what thing is.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.133
I don't know if anybody
could sleep in here

08:22.135 --> 08:23.969
because if somebody is up here,

08:23.971 --> 08:26.004
they're getting
the full-on experience.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.772
The bed would be shaking.

08:27.774 --> 08:30.175
They're feeling irritated
not being able to sleep

08:30.177 --> 08:34.412
because of the constant energy.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.082
This would make
anybody go crazy.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.224
Okay. So now we talked about
your son's issues.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.893
Let's talk about you.
What's going on?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.761
I wake up sometimes
with bruising,

08:49.763 --> 08:52.030
and I didn't go to bed
with the bruising.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.199
Did they ever check
your white blood cell count?

08:54.201 --> 08:56.935
Anything wrong with that?
I get physicals every year.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.904
And nothing is going on?
Nothing.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.272
Okay. Anything else?

09:00.274 --> 09:03.775
Well, I woke up to my bed
violently shaking.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.076
How violently are we talking?

09:05.078 --> 09:06.411
Can you show me?

09:06.413 --> 09:09.581
Like enough to wake me up.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.117
And then I feel like
I'm in a ring of fire.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.219
So when you say a ring of fire,
do you, like, wake up

09:14.221 --> 09:16.454
and you see flames around you,
or you just feel that way?

09:16.456 --> 09:20.025
No. I feel it.
Like I'm burning in hell.

09:20.027 --> 09:22.160
It happens quite a bit.
All right.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.930
So how are you and Nathan
dealing with all this?

09:24.932 --> 09:28.533
Well, I talk to him.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.635
He pulls out his bible a lot...

09:30.637 --> 09:31.937
Okay.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.705
And he calls to God
and Jesus

09:33.707 --> 09:38.176
to help him, and...

09:38.178 --> 09:40.378
That's okay.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.614
Trying to get through
this whole thing.

09:42.616 --> 09:44.516
Yeah.
I try to help.

09:44.518 --> 09:47.886
He gets mad because I don't read
the bible as much as I should.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.554
You're trying, though.
Yeah.

09:49.556 --> 09:52.290
Okay.
I've tried all the options.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.427
You people were my last resort.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.399
Boy.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.969
I'm hearing dangerous telepath.

10:03.971 --> 10:07.372
I guess the person in here
has telepathy

10:07.374 --> 10:14.045
and might be influencing
other people in the house

10:14.047 --> 10:19.084
who might not really
be having experiences,

10:19.086 --> 10:22.587
but rather they're
induced by this person.

10:29.062 --> 10:33.598
So this telepath thought, I want
to protect who's ever in here,

10:33.600 --> 10:38.703
but their true intention is
they want something to happen,

10:38.705 --> 10:43.475
so inadvertently
they create something

10:43.477 --> 10:46.911
that is actually
going to scare.

10:49.249 --> 10:52.217
So is that jellyfish thing
you saw on the bed real?

10:52.219 --> 10:54.886
No. This thing is a
manifestation of

10:54.888 --> 10:57.555
that person's true intentions,

10:57.557 --> 11:00.625
so it would be terrifying,
I think.

11:19.955 --> 11:21.622
So, Eric, I was talking
to your mom earlier

11:21.624 --> 11:24.625
and she's having a lot
of experiences here.

11:24.627 --> 11:25.826
What about you?

11:25.828 --> 11:27.261
Have you seen anything
you can't explain?

11:27.263 --> 11:28.595
One time I was in the kitchen

11:28.597 --> 11:31.398
and I seen the cat
get swept off its feet.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.499
All four feet.

11:32.501 --> 11:34.435
It got swept on its side.

11:34.437 --> 11:36.570
Well, you know, Eric,
cats do funny things.

11:36.572 --> 11:39.807
You know, they say animals
see things that people don't.

11:39.809 --> 11:42.376
It's seeing something.
Definitely.

11:42.378 --> 11:43.610
So anything else?

11:43.612 --> 11:45.546
No.
No experience.

11:45.548 --> 11:47.047
So I'm curious.

11:47.049 --> 11:49.817
Why do you think everybody else
is effected, but you're not?

11:49.819 --> 11:51.552
Personally, I just,
I believe in it,

11:51.554 --> 11:52.786
I just don't let it get to me.

11:52.788 --> 11:54.288
I just won't let it.

11:54.290 --> 11:55.956
Okay.
That's fair enough.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.459
Your mom, she thinks that
whatever is in this house

11:58.461 --> 12:00.794
is causing everybody
to fight with each other.

12:00.796 --> 12:01.929
Do you agree with that?

12:01.931 --> 12:03.330
Yeah.
I agree.

12:03.332 --> 12:06.533
My mom, my brother
and my stepfather,

12:06.535 --> 12:08.702
it's like a triangle.
They all fight.

12:08.704 --> 12:10.337
Is there a drastic change
in their personalities.

12:10.339 --> 12:12.239
Yeah. Yeah.
Big time.

12:12.241 --> 12:14.775
Now, it's funny
you mention brother.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.109
He doesn't even want
to talk to me

12:16.111 --> 12:18.345
about this whole situation
that's going on here.

12:18.347 --> 12:20.347
No.
He keeps it bottled up inside.

12:20.349 --> 12:21.882
He doesn't really
talk much about it.

12:21.884 --> 12:23.250
Yeah.
Have you seen it affect him?

12:23.252 --> 12:25.853
Yeah. I've heard him yell out,
"Leave me alone,"

12:25.855 --> 12:29.590
and "stop bothering them,"
and he's even cried before.

12:29.592 --> 12:31.859
So whatever it is it's not good.

12:34.997 --> 12:39.099
I'm getting panic, panic, panic.

12:39.101 --> 12:42.336
I see a younger person in here,
and I see panic

12:42.338 --> 12:49.009
and, like, sweating
and freaking the...out.

12:49.011 --> 12:50.644
He can't breathe.
He's hyperventilating.

12:50.646 --> 12:53.213
He's freaking out.
He's crying.

12:53.215 --> 12:54.815
Okay. So this person

12:54.817 --> 13:00.888
is hearing
and seeing things.

13:00.890 --> 13:03.056
This is causing, like,

13:03.058 --> 13:06.093
super-duper,
crazy panic attacks.

13:06.095 --> 13:10.197
So he was a awake and he saw
and heard something,

13:10.199 --> 13:13.300
literally doing one of these,

13:13.302 --> 13:14.668
covering his ears

13:14.670 --> 13:16.770
trying to make it stop.

13:16.772 --> 13:20.140
It almost feels like the walls
are closing in on him.

13:24.179 --> 13:28.482
So I don't know if this person
is insane or a sensitive.

13:35.057 --> 13:36.990
Robie, I understand
you are Linda's husband.

13:36.992 --> 13:38.158
Yes.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.226
This paranormal stuff,
do you believe in it

13:39.228 --> 13:40.827
or did you believe in it?

13:40.829 --> 13:43.363
I didn't.
I do now.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.832
So what was it that changed you
from being a skeptic

13:45.834 --> 13:47.601
to a believer?

13:47.603 --> 13:49.970
I believe it was the howling
that I heard.

13:49.972 --> 13:51.572
Linda actually heard it also.

13:51.574 --> 13:53.707
All the hairs
on my arms stand up.

13:53.709 --> 13:54.975
Okay.

13:54.977 --> 13:57.477
It was like something
you would hear in a movie.

13:57.479 --> 13:58.812
All right.
Anything else?

13:58.814 --> 14:01.481
Some health issues.
Okay. Like what?

14:01.483 --> 14:02.916
Ulcerative colitis.

14:02.918 --> 14:04.952
That put me in the hospital
for a couple weeks.

14:04.954 --> 14:05.986
I get dizzy a lot.

14:05.988 --> 14:07.621
I don't know what it is,
you know?

14:07.623 --> 14:09.122
The doctors ever figure out
what the hell was wrong?

14:09.124 --> 14:11.525
No. They don't know
what was wrong with that.

14:11.527 --> 14:12.726
How do you feel now
that you're not here?

14:12.728 --> 14:13.994
I mean, I feel good.

14:13.996 --> 14:15.495
Any problems with
your colitis and all?

14:15.497 --> 14:17.364
No.
Interesting.

14:17.366 --> 14:19.299
Okay, so, anything else?

14:19.301 --> 14:21.602
I've seen shadow figures.

14:21.604 --> 14:22.736
Okay.
Where?

14:22.738 --> 14:25.405
In the dining room area, there.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.875
They were just fast
moving shadows.

14:28.877 --> 14:32.179
They moved so fast I really
couldn't get a shape on them.

14:32.181 --> 14:35.482
Now, have you ever seen other
shadow figures any place else?

14:35.484 --> 14:38.218
In the kitchen in front
of the kitchen sink.

14:38.220 --> 14:41.321
Now, Linda mentioned to me
that she thought your mood

14:41.323 --> 14:43.657
and your personality changed
when you moved here.

14:43.659 --> 14:45.258
Yes.
You agree with that?

14:45.260 --> 14:46.526
Yes, I do.

14:46.528 --> 14:48.295
I think my attitude,
it got worse.

14:48.297 --> 14:49.696
I don't know.

14:49.698 --> 14:51.999
It just seems like little things
were bothering me, you know?

14:52.001 --> 14:53.800
Now, what about Linda?

14:53.802 --> 14:55.268
Basically, the same thing.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.470
But let me ask you a question.

14:56.472 --> 14:57.371
If my partner turns around
and says, "Listen,

14:57.373 --> 14:59.039
a paranormal in this house

14:59.041 --> 15:00.874
is what caused you guys
to fight all the time,"

15:00.876 --> 15:03.010
would you consider getting
back with your wife?

15:03.012 --> 15:04.711
Personally, yes I would.

15:04.713 --> 15:07.280
My feeling is I would
like to get back.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.654
I'm seeing a deceased female.

15:13.656 --> 15:15.522
She is 16.

15:15.524 --> 15:19.593
She seems extremely confused.

15:19.595 --> 15:21.762
She looks like a dissection.

15:21.764 --> 15:26.800
She's got, like,
various stages of tissue,

15:26.802 --> 15:28.935
and then there's muscle,
and then there's bone,

15:28.937 --> 15:31.872
but it's also rotting
and there's, like, maggots.

15:33.942 --> 15:35.442
So she's a mess.

15:35.444 --> 15:40.380
She was dancing with, I guess,
a male that she had a crush on,

15:40.382 --> 15:44.718
and then that same
male attacked her,

15:44.720 --> 15:50.490
and then he threw her down
a hill, and then she's dead.

15:50.492 --> 15:57.164
She says, "I want to make
a nest so I can sleep."

15:57.166 --> 16:02.969
She says the living keep
waking her up so she gets upset.

16:02.971 --> 16:05.806
She's showing me her walking,
and it's weird, so

16:05.808 --> 16:13.213
I'm not sure if they're seeing
her, like a shadow person.

16:13.215 --> 16:16.416
She wants to nest,
I think, in the closet.

16:19.722 --> 16:22.089
Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

16:22.091 --> 16:23.190
What happened?

16:23.192 --> 16:26.593
She... freaked the...
out and went...

16:26.595 --> 16:30.630
She, like, went into my head

16:30.632 --> 16:32.165
and went out my neck,

16:32.167 --> 16:34.701
and it hurt.
That hurt.

16:49.859 --> 16:51.759
Linda says she's been
scratched and bruised,

16:51.761 --> 16:53.861
and I don't doubt
her for a second,

16:53.863 --> 16:55.129
but she also said she hears

16:55.131 --> 16:57.698
howling and growling
sounds indoors.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.667
To me, not everything
is paranormal

16:59.669 --> 17:00.901
so I'm heading back
to the house to meet

17:00.903 --> 17:02.236
with a pest control expert

17:02.238 --> 17:04.805
to see if some kind of
wildlife could be responsible.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.345
So here's the deal.

17:11.347 --> 17:13.414
My clients in the house
are complaining about waking up

17:13.415 --> 17:14.815
with scratches

17:14.817 --> 17:18.352
and hearing howling noises
and growling inside the house.

17:18.354 --> 17:19.887
They're convinced
it's the paranormal.

17:19.888 --> 17:22.623
Call me crazy, call me kooky,
but couldn't it be wildlife?

17:22.625 --> 17:24.258
There's a number of things
it could be,

17:24.260 --> 17:26.794
anything from a raccoon
to a squirrel.

17:26.796 --> 17:27.895
Could be bats.

17:27.896 --> 17:29.063
So if you could do me a favor

17:29.065 --> 17:30.498
and give the house
a thorough once-over...

17:30.500 --> 17:31.999
Yep.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.267
And inspect it for me
and let me know what you find.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.768
Absolutely.
Excellent. Thank you, buddy.

17:34.770 --> 17:36.403
Thank you.

17:38.941 --> 17:40.941
With all the strange sounds
Linda and her family

17:40.943 --> 17:44.678
are hearing I know I have
to rule out the obviously first.

17:46.716 --> 17:50.017
And if there isn't
a physical explanation,

17:50.019 --> 17:52.720
our only hope for answers
will have to come from Amy.

17:52.722 --> 17:54.655
Okay.
So what'd you find?

17:54.657 --> 17:56.290
Less than nothing.

17:56.292 --> 17:57.892
Not even mouse droppings.

17:57.894 --> 17:59.894
You found no evidence that
an animal

17:59.896 --> 18:02.663
or any kind of wildlife
could have caused scratching,

18:02.665 --> 18:04.665
growling, howling,
any of that stuff?

18:04.667 --> 18:05.766
Correct.

18:05.768 --> 18:06.934
Well, I appreciate
your time and your help.

18:06.936 --> 18:08.702
Thank you so, so much.
Thank you.

18:11.908 --> 18:15.776
I'm seeing that dead
teenage girl again.

18:15.778 --> 18:18.846
How might the living
experience her?

18:18.848 --> 18:23.083
I know that when she gets upset
she might scratch people.

18:23.085 --> 18:25.953
She also, you know, can make
people feel really,

18:25.955 --> 18:28.255
really cold or hot.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.827
Dead girl is out here,

18:33.829 --> 18:37.865
and I hear crying
from back there, weeping.

18:41.571 --> 18:43.470
So I'm thinking maybe
the living are hearing

18:43.472 --> 18:45.606
a female crying and weeping.

18:48.244 --> 18:50.611
So far I've got a client
who believes the paranormal

18:50.613 --> 18:53.747
is ripping her family apart.

18:53.749 --> 18:56.817
She also believes someone
killed themselves in her house,

18:56.819 --> 18:59.153
so I'm at the library
to see if that's true.

19:01.290 --> 19:04.224
Sure enough, I find a man
named Anthony Ventamiglia

19:04.226 --> 19:06.927
who hung himself
right in Linda's basement.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.866
So I got a local P.I.
looking into this suicide for me

19:12.868 --> 19:16.270
and he tells me the poor guy who
hung himself in Linda's house

19:16.272 --> 19:19.039
had a long, sad history
of mental illness.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.580
Okay. So what did you find out
about this guy's background?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.282
Well, we know that
Anthony Ventamiglia

19:28.284 --> 19:30.651
came to the United States
son of Italian immigrants.

19:30.653 --> 19:33.654
His father, Vincenzo,
was a laborer for

19:33.656 --> 19:36.090
the Boston and Maine railroad.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.791
At some point in the 1920s

19:37.793 --> 19:40.294
Vincenzo started to develop
mental health issues.

19:40.296 --> 19:42.296
He was hospitalized
at the New York State hospital

19:42.298 --> 19:44.698
until his death in 1938.
Okay.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.969
So it's 1938, Vincenzo is dead,
so what happens to Anthony?

19:48.971 --> 19:51.438
Anthony ends up enlisting
in the United States Army

19:51.440 --> 19:53.674
and actually serves
in World War II

19:53.676 --> 19:55.109
as a warrant officer.
Okay.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.543
That tells me a lot
about the guy already.

19:56.545 --> 19:58.178
I mean, he had to be
enlisted at some point,

19:58.180 --> 19:59.346
becomes a warrant officer,

19:59.348 --> 20:00.614
which, when I was
in the Marine Corps,

20:00.616 --> 20:03.183
was a lot more respected
than your regular officers.

20:03.185 --> 20:04.251
Correct.
All right.

20:04.253 --> 20:06.086
So, Jimmy, when does
he wind up here?

20:06.088 --> 20:09.223
In 1959, Anthony
and his mother, Domenica,

20:09.225 --> 20:10.591
buy this house, right here,

20:10.593 --> 20:13.260
and actually are the first
residents of this house.

20:13.262 --> 20:15.062
Wait, so him and his mother?
Correct.

20:15.064 --> 20:16.764
Okay. Married? Kids?

20:16.766 --> 20:19.066
He never got married,
and he didn't have any kids.

20:19.068 --> 20:20.234
All right. So, Jimmy,
when does this guy

20:20.236 --> 20:21.969
start going a little crazy?

20:21.971 --> 20:24.138
Well, it's hard to pinpoint
an exact time.

20:24.140 --> 20:28.208
By the mid 1980s, he was
having psychotic episodes.

20:28.210 --> 20:30.711
We have reports of him running
around the neighborhood

20:30.713 --> 20:32.780
in his underwear wielding
a knife threatening

20:32.782 --> 20:34.181
to kill anyone
who approached him.

20:34.183 --> 20:35.582
Okay. Does he ever get
arrested for that?

20:35.584 --> 20:37.851
No. He never gets arrested.
All right.

20:37.853 --> 20:40.254
Do we know if he ever
had counseling, medication?

20:40.256 --> 20:41.588
It doesn't appear that he did.

20:41.590 --> 20:44.191
It appears that he became more
and more of a recluse

20:44.193 --> 20:46.560
and confined himself
to the house.

20:46.562 --> 20:47.761
When does he kill himself?

20:47.763 --> 20:49.763
November 14th, 1987.

20:49.765 --> 20:51.532
Anthony is 70 years old.

20:51.534 --> 20:53.634
I actually have
the death certificate.

20:56.138 --> 20:58.505
All right. So where does he wind
up hanging himself?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.140
According to the police report,
he hung himself right here

21:00.142 --> 21:03.110
in the basement
on the center beam.

21:03.112 --> 21:04.478
Okay.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.879
So it's possible he hung himself
right here, literally.

21:05.881 --> 21:07.748
Correct.
Okay. So now Anthony is dead.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.183
What happens to the house?

21:09.185 --> 21:11.752
Believe it or not,
Domenica is still alive

21:11.754 --> 21:13.787
and she's forced
to sell the house

21:13.789 --> 21:16.056
and move into a nursing home,

21:16.058 --> 21:19.526
and she dies in 1989
at the age of 102.

21:19.528 --> 21:20.594
That's a pretty sad story

21:20.596 --> 21:22.296
because this guy
had a lot of potential.

21:22.298 --> 21:23.764
He did.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.332
Unfortunately, he had some of
the same mental health issues

21:25.334 --> 21:27.067
that his father had.

21:29.805 --> 21:35.676
Wow. It doesn't feel good
in this area.

21:35.678 --> 21:37.578
I hear a man crying over there,

21:37.580 --> 21:40.414
and he's sitting on a chair
and he's crying.

21:40.416 --> 21:42.916
Maybe he's, like, 50.

21:46.589 --> 21:50.157
Maybe a little older, like,
more probably 60s.

21:50.159 --> 21:52.926
Something very traumatic
happened to him

21:52.928 --> 21:55.162
and he's not dealing
with it well.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.235
But I think people would feel
that depression down here, I do.

22:01.237 --> 22:02.836
Yeah.
I just feel anxiety.

22:02.838 --> 22:03.804
I feel cold over there.

22:03.806 --> 22:05.739
I feel stressed.
I feel chaos.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.309
It's, kind of, making me
a little crazy in my mind.

22:09.311 --> 22:10.978
My head spins.

22:10.980 --> 22:12.913
You know, somebody
dropped dead here.

22:12.915 --> 22:14.748
Male, dead, boom.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.224

22:44.522 --> 22:46.922
You know, another thing got
my attention in research.

22:46.924 --> 22:48.524
Back in the '90s a dead body

22:48.526 --> 22:51.093
was found a couple of thousand
feet from Linda's house.

22:51.095 --> 22:52.594
I'm heading over to meet
a former cop

22:52.596 --> 22:54.096
who's familiar with the case,

22:54.098 --> 22:55.831
and he says the victim
was a rich kid

22:55.833 --> 22:57.633
who got in way
over his head.

23:03.207 --> 23:05.307
Well, Mike, I appreciate you
helping me out with this case.

23:05.309 --> 23:08.677
Now, the body they found right
by my client's property,

23:08.679 --> 23:09.845
what can you tell me about that?

23:09.847 --> 23:12.347
It was the body of James Connor.

23:12.349 --> 23:16.018
He's an individual who went
to a prestigious private school

23:16.020 --> 23:17.920
and he went to college at

23:17.922 --> 23:19.821
South Connecticut
State University.

23:19.823 --> 23:21.323
His nickname was Captain Jim

23:21.325 --> 23:24.660
because he had a business
piloting yachts in the area.

23:24.662 --> 23:26.728
Okay. So this guy sounds like
he came from

23:26.730 --> 23:28.463
the upper crust of society,
right?

23:28.465 --> 23:31.133
Yeah.
Okay. So what happened?

23:31.135 --> 23:33.101
I think he fell into
the wrong crowd,

23:33.103 --> 23:35.337
got addicted to crack cocaine.

23:35.339 --> 23:37.339
Well, on August 23rd, 1998,

23:37.341 --> 23:39.675
that's when Connor
leaves a bar in Essex

23:39.677 --> 23:41.476
and he drives down
to New London

23:41.478 --> 23:45.080
to a drug haven to score some
crack cocaine from three thugs.

23:45.082 --> 23:48.784
One of them was named
Gregory Pierre, aka Coyote.

23:48.786 --> 23:50.586
I can see where this is
going already, but all right.

23:50.588 --> 23:51.954
So what happens next?

23:51.956 --> 23:55.591
Coyote and two of his thugs,
they decide to rob Connor

23:55.593 --> 23:57.225
instead of selling
the crack cocaine,

23:57.227 --> 23:58.794
and I think, basically,

23:58.796 --> 24:00.662
they beat him to death
with metal pipes,

24:00.664 --> 24:03.065
but they also shot him
twice in the head.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.834
Okay. So, Mike, what was
the official cause of death?

24:05.836 --> 24:07.803
Initially they believed
the cause of death

24:07.805 --> 24:10.372
was the gunshot wound and
probably the loss of blood...

24:10.374 --> 24:11.440
Okay.

24:11.442 --> 24:12.975
But as they further
looked into it,

24:12.977 --> 24:15.243
there was multiple blows to
the head with these metal pipes,

24:15.245 --> 24:16.511
and actually,
one of the reports, Steve, says

24:16.513 --> 24:18.113
they actually put a pipe
down his throat

24:18.115 --> 24:19.314
and snapped his neck.

24:19.316 --> 24:20.916
Okay.

24:20.918 --> 24:22.017
So they kill this rich guy.

24:22.019 --> 24:23.785
What do these thugs do next?

24:23.787 --> 24:25.287
They try to hide the evidence.

24:25.289 --> 24:26.655
They dump his body, probably,

24:26.657 --> 24:28.490
within 1,000 feet
of your client's house.

24:28.492 --> 24:31.426
Well, then they drive Connor's
down here and they, actually,

24:31.428 --> 24:34.696
try to sink it in this pond,
right here, which is crazy

24:34.698 --> 24:37.499
because the police department
is right next to the pond.

24:37.501 --> 24:39.935
Okay. Thank god they're stupid.
Yeah.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.637
The police found the car
early the next morning

24:41.639 --> 24:42.738
because it didn't sink.

24:42.740 --> 24:44.139
It was only partially submerged.
All right.

24:44.141 --> 24:46.208
So how'd they wind up
catching these three mutts?

24:46.210 --> 24:48.210
Well, they were
sloppy criminals, Steve.

24:48.212 --> 24:50.512
They actually end up
leaving a lot of blood

24:50.514 --> 24:51.813
stains in Connor's car...

24:51.815 --> 24:53.048
Okay.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.783
And they went around
talking about it publicly,

24:54.785 --> 24:57.252
you know, bragging
about their crime.

24:57.254 --> 25:00.656
Here's a article on the arrests.

25:00.658 --> 25:02.257
All right, Mike, so what did
these guys

25:02.259 --> 25:03.392
wind up getting charged with?

25:03.394 --> 25:04.726
They were charged
with felony murder.

25:04.728 --> 25:07.095
They go to trial and they up
getting convicted.

25:07.097 --> 25:08.730
All three of them
got 85 years in jail.

25:08.732 --> 25:11.333
All right. So, Mike, you and I
both worked the crack epidemic

25:11.335 --> 25:13.235
back in the day.
Yeah.

25:13.237 --> 25:14.469
Very rare, though,
did you see somebody

25:14.471 --> 25:16.972
from an affluent community
get mixed up with crack.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.807
Obviously he had
no street smarts.

25:18.809 --> 25:21.276
Yeah. It doesn't sound like
he was smart enough

25:21.278 --> 25:22.711
to know what was actually
going to happen to him.

25:22.713 --> 25:24.713
Okay.

25:30.187 --> 25:34.256
I saw a flash of a male.

25:37.061 --> 25:39.194
Very tall, he's like 6 foot.

25:39.196 --> 25:41.997
I think he's between 40 and 42.

25:41.999 --> 25:43.398
He was very wealthy.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.034
Do you have any idea
how he died?

25:46.036 --> 25:49.504
He tells me he was
strangled or choked.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.373
He wasn't exactly sure.

25:51.375 --> 25:54.876
He knows that he felt
pressure around his throat.

25:54.878 --> 26:00.215
He just wants to
find his way out.

26:00.217 --> 26:03.885
There was a male involved,
and he said about his male,

26:03.887 --> 26:07.355
"I guess it was blind jealousy.
Always wanted what I had."

26:07.357 --> 26:10.058
Something very traumatic
happened to him,

26:10.060 --> 26:12.561
and it was really bad.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.737
I encountered several
disturbing things on my walk,

26:21.739 --> 26:24.106
but two stood out.

26:24.108 --> 26:26.508
First, the strange-looking
creature in the bedroom

26:26.510 --> 26:28.243
with the bunk beds.

26:28.245 --> 26:32.948
It had, like, these feather
things around its head.

26:35.986 --> 26:39.888
It would change its face.

26:39.890 --> 26:43.291
The body was kind of
like a jellyfish.

26:46.096 --> 26:48.163
Next, I described
the dead teenage girl

26:48.165 --> 26:49.798
attacking the living.

26:49.800 --> 26:56.471
There's this deceased female,
and when people disturb her

26:56.473 --> 26:59.374
she tends to lash out
and scratch them.

27:07.217 --> 27:10.018
Amy, is this what
you saw?

27:10.020 --> 27:11.887
Yes. That's what I saw.

27:30.658 --> 27:33.525
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:33.527 --> 27:35.627
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:35.629 --> 27:38.664
and our clients,
for the first time.

27:38.666 --> 27:42.901
Well, Amy, this is Linda and her
soon to be ex-husband, Robie.

27:42.903 --> 27:44.236
And I got to tell you,
this investigation

27:44.238 --> 27:45.637
was very frustrating for me

27:45.639 --> 27:47.973
because the person who's
getting the worst of it here

27:47.975 --> 27:49.308
refused to talk to me.

27:49.310 --> 27:50.442
Linda's son, Nathan,

27:50.444 --> 27:52.511
wanted absolutely
nothing to do with us.

27:52.513 --> 27:54.780
Bottom line is I'm still glad
we took the case

27:54.782 --> 27:56.248
because things here
are getting violent,

27:56.250 --> 27:59.117
and Linda's afraid somebody
is going to get hurt.

27:59.119 --> 28:01.253
So now that I introduced
Amy to you guys,

28:01.255 --> 28:03.121
I'll have her describe
her walk for us.

28:05.993 --> 28:07.559
So when I first got here

28:07.561 --> 28:10.762
I suddenly felt
overcome with nausea.

28:10.764 --> 28:14.433
I almost felt like I was just
going to start vomiting,

28:14.435 --> 28:17.469
and I thought, okay,
if I feel this way,

28:17.471 --> 28:19.638
then I would assume that
the living people here

28:19.640 --> 28:22.874
would feel this way,
and feel it very often

28:22.876 --> 28:26.211
because this was
absolutely debilitating.

28:26.213 --> 28:31.049
I was nervous that I wouldn't be
able to even perform the walk.

28:31.051 --> 28:33.585
Amy, you're hitting on one
of the reasons called us in.

28:33.587 --> 28:35.153
Tell Amy about
the health issues, here.

28:35.155 --> 28:36.722
Yeah.

28:36.724 --> 28:41.059
Nausea, chest pains,
never feel good.

28:41.061 --> 28:42.594
My son, Nathan, remember?

28:42.596 --> 28:43.996
He'd always come in gray

28:43.998 --> 28:47.766
and run to the bathroom
and start vomiting.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.103
I mean, everybody never felt
good around here at all.

28:54.608 --> 28:58.043
So when I walked
into the house

28:58.045 --> 29:02.114
I felt an incredibly
terrible energy

29:02.116 --> 29:04.549
that was emanating
from a dead guy

29:04.551 --> 29:07.986
who, I think, was here
in the '80s or the '90s.

29:07.988 --> 29:11.156
His energy just, kind of,
was absorbed by the home

29:11.158 --> 29:13.959
and is, like,
pouring out of the walls.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.194
The living people
would definitely be

29:16.196 --> 29:18.230
affected by this energy,

29:18.232 --> 29:21.466
and it's a lot of anger,
irritation.

29:21.468 --> 29:24.936
I felt like you would hear
yelling and screaming.

29:24.938 --> 29:28.140
And then, I felt like there was
a definite living male

29:28.142 --> 29:29.608
who's here,

29:29.610 --> 29:31.376
who resides here,

29:31.378 --> 29:34.913
who is experiencing
this severe anger.

29:34.915 --> 29:37.449
Nathan.
Okay.

29:37.451 --> 29:40.152
So before we get into Nathan,
now is probably a good time

29:40.154 --> 29:42.854
to tell you about one of
the main reasons we're here.

29:42.856 --> 29:44.856
Now, Linda and Robie
are about to divorce

29:44.858 --> 29:46.391
after 9 years of marriage,

29:46.393 --> 29:48.093
and both of them
think it's because

29:48.095 --> 29:50.228
the house changed
their personalities.

29:50.230 --> 29:52.364
Everything was okay for a while

29:52.366 --> 29:56.034
and then we just slowly,
we didn't realize it,

29:56.036 --> 29:57.936
we would argue and bicker

29:57.938 --> 30:00.505
and argue and bicker
over nothing.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.708
Do you think it's the house
that did this to them?

30:02.710 --> 30:06.144
It could be a result
of the negative energy.

30:06.146 --> 30:08.447
And then you guys are
projecting this yelling

30:08.449 --> 30:10.649
and screaming
into the walls as well,

30:10.651 --> 30:12.984
and then it's all
playing back in.

30:12.986 --> 30:14.152
As far as Nathan goes,

30:14.154 --> 30:15.987
did you notice a personality
change in him?

30:15.989 --> 30:17.155
Yes.

30:17.157 --> 30:20.492
He always had a negative
answer to everything.

30:20.494 --> 30:23.161
Nathan is very angry.

30:23.163 --> 30:25.097
He's just so nasty.

30:27.735 --> 30:32.204
Next, I came into your basement,
and I saw a depressed dead man.

30:32.206 --> 30:34.539
He was in his late 50s,
early 60s.

30:34.541 --> 30:35.941
It was kind of hard to tell.

30:35.943 --> 30:37.609
It felt like he died here.

30:37.611 --> 30:39.444
He died down here.

30:39.446 --> 30:42.781
When I saw him
he had experienced

30:42.783 --> 30:45.584
some kind of massive,
major loss,

30:45.586 --> 30:47.819
and he was not
taking it well at all.

30:47.821 --> 30:52.057
He was extremely distraught,
crying, depressed.

30:52.059 --> 30:55.727
When I was around him I felt
anxiety, stress and chaos,

30:55.729 --> 31:00.132
and it was kind of making me
feel a little crazy.

31:00.134 --> 31:02.300
I'm pretty sure I know
who she's talking about.

31:02.302 --> 31:04.436
I want to tell you about this
guy named Anthony Ventamiglia.

31:04.438 --> 31:06.104
He was the first owner
of this house.

31:06.106 --> 31:08.774
He and his mother lived here
for almost 30 years.

31:08.776 --> 31:11.610
Now, Anthony's family had
a history of mental illness.

31:11.612 --> 31:13.211
When he was little,
his dad was sent away

31:13.213 --> 31:15.347
to an institution
and never came home.

31:15.349 --> 31:16.982
He would wind up dying
in a mental hospital.

31:16.984 --> 31:17.983
Wow.

31:17.985 --> 31:19.584
Shortly after moving here,

31:19.586 --> 31:21.920
Anthony started
to go crazy himself.

31:21.922 --> 31:24.623
I talked to a local P.I.,
and he told me in the '80s

31:24.625 --> 31:26.291
Anthony used to go out
in the streets

31:26.293 --> 31:27.592
here in his underwear
with a knife

31:27.594 --> 31:30.262
and threaten anybody
that came near him.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.497
Now, on November 14th, 1987,

31:32.499 --> 31:35.567
Anthony hung himself
right here in the basement.

31:35.569 --> 31:37.435
He was 70.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.271
This is a copy of his death
certificate.

31:41.475 --> 31:43.041
After hearing this, you pretty
sure it's this guy

31:43.043 --> 31:45.510
Anthony?

31:45.512 --> 31:46.812
Yes.

31:46.814 --> 31:50.482
More than likely
we have his energy

31:50.484 --> 31:54.286
as the initial baseline
that was absorbed by the house.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.889
So you guys move into a house,
and so you're walking into that,

31:57.891 --> 32:00.258
and you're going to be
feeling that way.

32:04.965 --> 32:06.698
Okay.
Anything else?

32:06.700 --> 32:11.937
So the next person I encountered
was a deceased female

32:11.939 --> 32:14.372
approximately 16 years of age.

32:14.374 --> 32:17.342
When I encountered her,
side of her was, like, rotting

32:17.344 --> 32:22.013
and, you know, kind of bony,
you know, like, decomposing.

32:22.015 --> 32:25.350
And she was murdered,

32:25.352 --> 32:27.385
and she told me that
the reason why she's here

32:27.387 --> 32:30.121
is because she's trying
to build a nest,

32:30.123 --> 32:34.192
and her nest happens
to be in the closets.

32:34.194 --> 32:38.697
She will lash out
when you guys disturb her.

32:38.699 --> 32:42.100
She scratches people
when she gets irritated.

32:42.102 --> 32:44.703
I went into the other closet
up here.

32:44.705 --> 32:47.939
I opened that,
and she freaked the...out,

32:47.941 --> 32:50.308
and she whooshed
into my eye

32:50.310 --> 32:54.112
and out my head,
and it was ice-cold.

32:54.114 --> 32:56.848
She's always watching, always
watching, always listening,

32:56.850 --> 32:58.116
so I felt like the living here

32:58.118 --> 33:01.119
may feel like they're
always being watched.

33:01.121 --> 33:04.055
And I also heard her crying.

33:04.057 --> 33:06.458
It was outside.
I heard her crying.

33:06.460 --> 33:10.362
You may see her
as a small shadow figure.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.763
Now, I didn't come
across a homicide

33:11.765 --> 33:13.632
that fits that description
in my research,

33:13.634 --> 33:16.234
but a lot of the experiences
you're talking about,

33:16.236 --> 33:17.335
these guys are having.

33:17.337 --> 33:19.271
I seen that shadow person
in the kitchen.

33:19.273 --> 33:21.606
You've also heard
strange noises, right?

33:21.608 --> 33:23.541
I've heard them out back
in the woods.

33:23.543 --> 33:25.343
I've heard screaming
and yelling.

33:25.345 --> 33:26.811
Yeah.

33:26.813 --> 33:29.314
Now, Linda, you told me
about scratches you had.

33:29.316 --> 33:33.418
I've woken up with scratches,
like, on my arm

33:33.420 --> 33:37.422
or maybe on my neck,
Nathan, on his leg.

33:37.424 --> 33:40.525
He would be scratched
in the shower.

33:40.527 --> 33:42.761
So when you guys said that
you had been scratched

33:42.763 --> 33:45.597
and also heard growling
and howling down in the house,

33:45.599 --> 33:47.866
here, I had a pest
control expert come in to see

33:47.868 --> 33:50.101
if some kind of wildlife
could have been doing that.

33:50.103 --> 33:51.269
You know what?

33:51.271 --> 33:52.504
He checked this place
from top to bottom,

33:52.506 --> 33:54.205
and he gave this place
a clean bill of health.

33:54.207 --> 33:57.375
He said he couldn't even find
evidence of mouse droppings.

33:57.377 --> 33:59.744
Wow.

33:59.746 --> 34:02.414
Amy, did you get
a good look at this girl?

34:02.416 --> 34:04.883
I had a sketch done.

34:13.460 --> 34:15.092
This is a little creepy?

34:19.132 --> 34:22.667
My God.
It kinda looks like me.

34:25.806 --> 34:27.539
This is creepy, knowing that
somebody can sit there

34:27.541 --> 34:30.976
and reach out and grab you
as you're walking by the closet.

34:30.978 --> 34:35.045
Yeah.
I don't like it.

34:35.047 --> 34:38.616
So I walked into all three of
the bedrooms in the house,

34:38.618 --> 34:40.952
and I saw some pretty
disturbing things.

34:40.954 --> 34:42.786
When I went through
the front door

34:42.789 --> 34:44.322
I went first
to the right.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.157
That's Eric's room.
Eric's room.

34:46.159 --> 34:48.493
Yeah. I got a photo of Eric,
right here.

34:48.495 --> 34:50.495
Wow.
Wait a minute.

34:50.496 --> 34:51.996
How old is he?

34:51.998 --> 34:53.864
He'll be 31 in August.

34:53.867 --> 34:56.701
I saw this person sweating
and freaking out.

34:56.703 --> 35:02.173
He was crying and he was,
basically, losing it,

35:02.175 --> 35:04.976
and it just felt like everything
was closing in on him.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.544
That sounds like Nathan.

35:06.546 --> 35:07.879
Eric actually talked to me.

35:07.881 --> 35:09.948
He told me he doesn't
experience anything, here.

35:09.950 --> 35:11.182
You're his mom.

35:11.184 --> 35:14.552
Is the crying and freaking
out sound like Eric?

35:14.554 --> 35:16.054
No, no, no, no.
It doesn't.

35:16.056 --> 35:18.256
That doesn't sound
like Eric at all.

35:18.258 --> 35:19.391
It's a small house.

35:19.393 --> 35:20.859
Is it possible you could
have been picking up

35:20.861 --> 35:22.994
on Nathan's energy
in Eric's room?

35:22.996 --> 35:24.295
Yeah.
It's a possibility.

35:24.297 --> 35:26.064
Energy is energy,
and it's not always

35:26.066 --> 35:28.566
just contained to one room.

35:30.804 --> 35:33.405
So then I went into the bunk
bed room and, damn,

35:33.407 --> 35:34.939
that room is active.

35:34.941 --> 35:38.443
I saw a very strange
thing in there.

35:38.445 --> 35:42.547
There was this long, like,
thing that slithers along,

35:42.549 --> 35:45.350
goes onto the bunk
bed up on top.

35:45.352 --> 35:48.286
It had, like, a clear,
jelly body.

35:48.288 --> 35:51.156
So I think if somebody slept
on that top bunk, specifically,

35:51.158 --> 35:52.624
I don't think
they'd get much sleep.

35:52.626 --> 35:54.692
This is a lot of
uncomfortable energy.

35:54.694 --> 35:56.628
I think they'd be
very irritated.

35:56.630 --> 36:00.698
Okay. So, obviously,
Nathan's room, right?

36:00.700 --> 36:02.133
Yeah.

36:02.135 --> 36:04.002
Describe what Nathan told you
he sees in the room, there.

36:04.004 --> 36:05.437
Yeah.

36:05.439 --> 36:08.073
He said he sees something on
the floor that stares at him.

36:08.075 --> 36:12.110
You know, kind of, just squats
and stares at him.

36:12.112 --> 36:14.079
Eric has told me
he's heard him yell,

36:14.081 --> 36:15.613
"Get away from me.
Leave me alone.

36:15.615 --> 36:18.016
Just leave me alone,"
and then Eric will go by

36:18.018 --> 36:19.451
and see him crying,

36:19.453 --> 36:22.020
and just crying,
crying, crying.

36:22.022 --> 36:23.254
Now, this is what's frustrating

36:23.256 --> 36:24.889
about not being able
to talk to Nathan...

36:24.891 --> 36:26.424
Yes.
Because he could have explained

36:26.426 --> 36:27.659
to me what the hell this thing

36:27.661 --> 36:29.094
really looked like to him.
Right.

36:29.096 --> 36:30.128
I mean, what do you think
it looked like?

36:30.130 --> 36:32.330
I did have a sketch done
of what I saw.

36:39.106 --> 36:40.238
That's pretty messed up.

36:42.476 --> 36:45.076
Holy...

36:45.078 --> 36:47.312
That's awful.

36:47.314 --> 36:49.681
My God.
No wonder he's freaked out.

36:49.683 --> 36:52.183
Wow.

36:57.257 --> 36:59.924
That's freaky, man.
I feel bad for the kid.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.826
No wonder he's all...up.

37:29.005 --> 37:31.606
That's freaky, man.
I feel bad for the kid.

37:31.608 --> 37:33.474
No wonder he's all...up.

37:41.318 --> 37:42.750
That must have been
what he saw, maybe,

37:42.752 --> 37:46.087
squatting on the bottom
and staring at him?

37:46.089 --> 37:50.291
Now, what I'm about to tell you
is extremely difficult.

37:50.293 --> 37:54.095
Just listen, okay?

37:54.097 --> 37:58.600
When I walked into
the master bedroom

37:58.602 --> 38:01.869
I heard "dangerous telepath."

38:04.708 --> 38:07.075
That's my room.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.877
So am I in danger?

38:09.879 --> 38:12.180
No.
What they're...

38:12.182 --> 38:13.581
It means I'm
a dangerous telepath?

38:13.583 --> 38:17.085
Yes.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.553
What am I doing?

38:18.555 --> 38:22.290
A lot of the haunting in this
house is coming from you.

38:22.292 --> 38:24.792
You, inadvertently,
created this monster.

38:24.794 --> 38:26.160
It's not real.

38:26.162 --> 38:28.229
So this thing is made by Linda?

38:28.231 --> 38:30.198
Yes.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.967
And so I would say
maybe 50 percent

38:32.969 --> 38:35.370
of what you're experiencing
is paranormal as far as,

38:35.372 --> 38:38.906
yeah, the girl is pissed off
and scratching people,

38:38.908 --> 38:42.110
yeah, there's a dead guy
wandering around,

38:42.112 --> 38:46.748
but 50 percent
is living-created.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.817
I don't want to cause
any harm to anybody.

38:49.819 --> 38:54.656
Now, here's the thing is that
telepaths typically develop

38:54.658 --> 38:58.493
that ability when they're
young, when they're children.

38:58.495 --> 39:02.630
So you developed that ability,
but you moved into this house,

39:02.632 --> 39:05.967
and I think that's where
the problem really starts.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.235
Okay.

39:07.237 --> 39:11.039
The residual energy is not
conducive to a person

39:11.041 --> 39:13.975
with that type
of ability to be here.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.910
And it starts with the crazy
guy that hung himself?

39:15.912 --> 39:18.413
I believe so.

39:22.352 --> 39:25.853
Now, Linda, I know you've always
had the best of intentions,

39:25.855 --> 39:27.121
but from what Amy is saying,

39:27.123 --> 39:30.458
it sounds like you're
haunting your family,

39:30.460 --> 39:32.927
and, honestly, I've never
heard anything like this

39:32.929 --> 39:35.630
in all the years
I'm working with her.

39:35.632 --> 39:37.865
Now we got to figure out
to fix this mess,

39:37.867 --> 39:39.867
so for that I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

39:42.706 --> 39:45.673
Okay. So you are dealing with
a lot of things, here.

39:45.675 --> 39:49.944
You have a lot of negative
residual energy

39:49.946 --> 39:53.081
that was placed here, I believe,
by the previous owner,

39:53.083 --> 39:55.516
the individual
who killed himself.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.252
So the first thing
that needs to be done

39:58.254 --> 40:01.789
is the residual energy
needs to be removed.

40:01.791 --> 40:03.658
The first thing that you
would need to do

40:03.660 --> 40:08.830
is have a Reiki master come in
and cleanse the house,

40:08.832 --> 40:10.198
and what they're
basically going to do

40:10.200 --> 40:12.467
is remove the old
negative energy

40:12.469 --> 40:15.770
and bring in positive energy.

40:15.772 --> 40:17.305
As far as the dead girl
is concerned,

40:17.307 --> 40:19.140
I'm going to take
her home with me.

40:19.142 --> 40:21.008
I'm going to move her
on at home.

40:21.010 --> 40:23.678
You got a freebie on that one.

40:23.680 --> 40:27.381
Now, what about Linda
and her dangerous telepathy?

40:27.383 --> 40:31.953
What I would like you to do is
Makko Ho exercises, stretches.

40:31.955 --> 40:34.255
So its going to help you harness
and balance your energy

40:34.257 --> 40:35.656
in a positive way.

40:35.658 --> 40:37.458
So that will get rid of this
thing in his bedroom,

40:37.460 --> 40:38.626
Nathan's bedroom?

40:38.628 --> 40:40.628
Yes.

40:40.630 --> 40:41.963
So once this is all done,

40:41.965 --> 40:44.031
and if I do everything
and everything gets done,

40:44.033 --> 40:45.366
will this house be okay?

40:45.368 --> 40:46.667
Yeah.

40:46.669 --> 40:48.336
It's like indescribable
how different it would be.

40:48.338 --> 40:51.639
Your home will be
a completely different space.

40:51.641 --> 40:53.741
You'll be a completely
different person.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.042
You want to hold off
on that divorce,

40:55.044 --> 40:56.878
or you want to do it anyway
and see what happens?

40:56.880 --> 40:58.946
I can't answer that right now.

40:58.948 --> 41:01.215
If I were you
I'd hold off on it.

41:01.217 --> 41:05.820
You may be very different
in 6 months, is what I'm saying.

41:05.822 --> 41:07.088
Yeah.
Give it some time.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.589
Allow this healing to happen.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.058
Allow your home to be
cleansed and renewed.

41:11.060 --> 41:12.960
Now, Robie, you said you would
give her moral support.

41:12.962 --> 41:14.796
What about cleaning up?
Would you help her with that?

41:14.798 --> 41:17.465
Sure, I would.
All she's got to do is call.

41:17.467 --> 41:19.567
She knows that.

41:19.569 --> 41:21.869
I'll help her with anything
she needs help with, so.

41:24.541 --> 41:27.108
I really hope Linda
contacts a Reiki master

41:27.110 --> 41:30.645
to remove the negative
residual energy from her home

41:30.647 --> 41:32.246
so she can focus on herself

41:32.248 --> 41:35.283
and learn how to get
her abilities under control.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.885
If she does that, the family
might finally be able

41:37.887 --> 41:40.388
to find the peace
they've been hoping for.
