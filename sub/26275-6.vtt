09:07.561 --> 09:09.064
Hey, don't say that.

09:09.064 --> 09:11.335
Yeah, math was hard for me, too,

09:11.335 --> 09:15.142
and nobody thinks
that I'm stupid.

09:15.142 --> 09:18.015
I‐I try,
but I‐I just can't do it.

09:18.015 --> 09:20.687
You're a Baxter.
You guys can do anything.

09:20.687 --> 09:22.958
Even Vin Diesel impressions.

09:22.958 --> 09:25.530
Yeah, and‐and maybe
we can help you.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.801
But how am I supposed
to remember that,

09:27.801 --> 09:31.441
uh, "tangent equals opposite
over adjacent"?

09:31.441 --> 09:33.112
Well, what I used to do
is just, you know,

09:33.112 --> 09:34.715
come up with fun ways
to remember things.

09:34.715 --> 09:38.322
So, if tangent equals opposite
over adjacent,

09:38.322 --> 09:41.328
then "T" equals "O" over "A."

09:41.328 --> 09:42.998
So, T‐O‐A.

09:42.998 --> 09:44.669
So just remember...

09:44.669 --> 09:47.173
tickle... ostriches...

09:47.173 --> 09:48.810
always.

09:50.312 --> 09:54.154
This is known
as a moronic device.

09:55.389 --> 09:56.759
(chuckles)
Wow.

09:56.759 --> 09:58.362
You guys are brilliant.

09:58.362 --> 10:01.001
We get that a lot.
(chuckles)

10:01.001 --> 10:04.340
And Ryan said
we didn't know how to parent.

10:06.445 --> 10:07.881
Hey, is there any way
you guys can help me

10:07.881 --> 10:08.883
with the rest of this?

10:08.883 --> 10:10.252
Yeah, of course.

10:10.252 --> 10:11.789
(bad Italian accent):
"We're family."

10:11.789 --> 10:13.292
No. Hang on. Hold on.

10:13.292 --> 10:14.628
(bad New York accent):
"We're family."

10:14.628 --> 10:16.566
I can't... Family. Fam...

10:16.566 --> 10:19.070
Eh, I can't do it.

10:21.709 --> 10:25.382
Well... (chuckles) I am so glad
you were able to squeeze me in

10:25.382 --> 10:27.588
for lunch between your dates
with Ed.

10:27.588 --> 10:31.796
Oh, I cannot remember
a better visit to Denver.

10:31.796 --> 10:33.132
(chuckles)

10:34.167 --> 10:36.338
Huh.

10:36.338 --> 10:39.779
Uh, you know, I‐I think
this might be the perfect time

10:39.779 --> 10:42.083
to, uh... to talk to you
about something.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.187
Oh, dear.
This sounds important.

10:44.187 --> 10:45.757
Will it take long?

10:45.757 --> 10:48.797
Ed's taking me to an exhibit
at the art museum.

10:48.797 --> 10:50.299
‐What?
‐Yeah.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.604
They're all nudes.

10:52.604 --> 10:55.309
Even the boys.

10:55.309 --> 10:57.714
Uh, excuse me.

10:57.714 --> 10:59.518
I‐I suddenly need to go
to the ladies' room.

10:59.518 --> 11:01.956
Oh, okay.

11:01.956 --> 11:05.764
‐Hey Vanessa, good to...
‐No time, no time.

11:05.764 --> 11:07.801
Good to see you, too, Chuck.
How's your day going?

11:07.801 --> 11:09.304
Oh, pretty good, actually.

11:09.304 --> 11:12.009
I won 20 bucks on a scratcher.

11:12.009 --> 11:13.278
Oh, Ed. Hi.

11:13.278 --> 11:15.282
Oh, Vanessa.

11:15.282 --> 11:17.086
I was just heading down
to get your mother.

11:17.086 --> 11:18.857
‐We're gonna look at
some dirty pictures.
‐Uh, yeah.

11:18.857 --> 11:20.760
Uh, I‐I want to talk to you
about that.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.296
I‐I jest, of course.

11:22.296 --> 11:24.267
We're also gonna look at
some dirty statues.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.304
Ed, I think it's great
that you and my mom

11:26.304 --> 11:27.774
have started this relationship.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.344
I‐I mean, she raves about you.

11:29.344 --> 11:30.947
You're‐you're all
she talks about.

11:30.947 --> 11:32.985
But I don't get to spend time
with her anymore,

11:32.985 --> 11:35.690
because she's all wrapped up
in you.

11:35.690 --> 11:39.364
Well, uh, Vanessa, I had no idea
it's created such a situation.

11:39.364 --> 11:42.203
Yeah, well‐well, it has, so, um,
if you don't mind,

11:42.203 --> 11:44.374
I‐I would like to spend time
with my mom.

11:44.374 --> 11:46.378
And, uh, I would really
appreciate it

11:46.378 --> 11:48.850
if‐if maybe you didn't take her
to the museum.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.754
Of course. Of course, of course.

11:50.754 --> 11:53.225
Just give me a second, I'll go
right down and tell her myself.

11:53.225 --> 11:55.897
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Uh, oh, and, yeah, when you get

11:55.897 --> 11:58.235
to the table, um, I'll say
something to cover, like, uh,

11:58.235 --> 12:01.676
like, "Hi, Ed. So nice to see
you for the first time today."

12:05.316 --> 12:07.119
‐Oh, hey, Vanessa.
‐Sorry, in a hurry.

12:07.119 --> 12:09.223
Oh, this shirt?

12:09.223 --> 12:11.161
Yeah, it's new.

12:11.161 --> 12:14.367
I know purple's bold, but I
figured I'd roll the dice.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.204
‐Ooh.
‐(panting): Hi.

12:16.204 --> 12:18.810
Darling, you're all out of
breath. Is everything okay?

12:18.810 --> 12:21.314
‐Uh, had to use
the upstairs bathroom.
‐Oh.

12:21.314 --> 12:23.553
There was a woman cleaning
the downstairs bathroom.

12:23.553 --> 12:25.089
Her name's Theresa.

12:25.089 --> 12:27.527
We're...
we're gonna play tennis.

12:27.527 --> 12:29.865
Ooh, Ed. Hi.

12:29.865 --> 12:31.368
There's Ed.

12:31.368 --> 12:33.405
Yeah, so nice to see you again.

12:33.405 --> 12:35.175
Oh, uh, for the first time.

12:36.378 --> 12:38.181
Is it time to leave already?

12:38.181 --> 12:40.352
No. Actually, my dear, I won't
be able to accompany you

12:40.352 --> 12:41.689
to the museum today.

12:41.689 --> 12:43.125
Oh, it's no problem, Eddie.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.062
Um, maybe we can do it tomorrow.

12:45.062 --> 12:46.632
I'm afraid not.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.103
See, we seem to be drifting
into deeper waters,

12:49.103 --> 12:51.274
and I don't know
if this old schooner

12:51.274 --> 12:53.078
is quite seaworthy anymore.

12:53.078 --> 12:54.648
Do you get what I'm saying?

12:54.648 --> 12:58.321
You're leaving on a boat?

12:58.321 --> 13:02.229
(stammers) You're just canceling
plans for today, right?

13:02.229 --> 13:05.870
A relationship just isn't
in the cards for me right now.

13:07.073 --> 13:09.010
Please forgive me.

13:09.010 --> 13:10.245
Vanessa.

13:13.118 --> 13:15.957
Oh...

13:15.957 --> 13:19.097
Vanessa, I‐I think I'd like
to go home now.

13:19.097 --> 13:21.267
No. I understand. We'll‐we'll
just have lunch at the house.

13:21.267 --> 13:24.775
No. No. I mean <i>home</i> home
to‐to Connecticut.

13:24.775 --> 13:27.547
Well, uh...
would you excuse me again?

13:27.547 --> 13:30.319
I‐I just, uh, need to cancel
my tennis game with Theresa.

13:31.321 --> 13:33.325
Hey, Chuck.

13:33.325 --> 13:35.897
You go ahead.
We already talked.

13:41.441 --> 13:42.844
MIKE:
<i>No, no, Ed.</i>

13:42.844 --> 13:46.117
I don't want
to go see nude men with you.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.625
(pants)

13:49.625 --> 13:51.361
Ed, you have got some nerve

13:51.361 --> 13:53.699
breaking up with my mother
like that.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.837
Well, you said you wanted to
spend some more time with her.

13:55.837 --> 13:58.709
Bananas.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.947
I didn't mean to dump her.

14:00.947 --> 14:02.918
When you said Bonnie thinks
that we're in a relationship,

14:02.918 --> 14:05.657
I thought maybe it's time
that I just step back

14:05.657 --> 14:07.594
‐a little bit, you know?
‐And why is that?

14:07.594 --> 14:09.063
Guys, could you please take this
someplace else?

14:09.063 --> 14:10.567
I don't want to get involved
in this.

14:10.567 --> 14:13.405
Well, actually, you see,
she's too much like you.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.643
Okay. Now I'm involved. What the
hell is that supposed to mean?

14:15.643 --> 14:19.350
She's not the kind of woman
that you can have fun with.

14:19.350 --> 14:21.354
MIKE and VANESSA:
And what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

14:21.354 --> 14:22.757
Calm down.

14:22.757 --> 14:25.162
Bonnie, like you,
is a woman of substance.

14:25.162 --> 14:27.767
The kind of women I date
are not as... as deep.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.673
You mean younger?

14:30.673 --> 14:33.211
‐Exactly.
‐Ah.

14:33.211 --> 14:35.115
See, the kind of women I go out
with, th‐th‐they're interested

14:35.115 --> 14:37.152
in me for my money,
and I'm interested in them

14:37.152 --> 14:40.058
because they're young women.

14:40.058 --> 14:43.031
Oh. That's right,
the greatest generation.

14:43.031 --> 14:45.068
Uh‐huh, you know
what I think, Ed?

14:45.068 --> 14:46.805
I th... I think you're scared.

14:46.805 --> 14:49.176
I think you're scared
to let someone in.

14:49.176 --> 14:52.684
And that... that makes me
feel sorry for you.

14:55.188 --> 14:57.927
You're right,
she's totally bananas.

14:57.927 --> 14:59.430
‐Or she's got a point.
‐Mm.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.434
Bonnie's a lot like Vanessa.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.804
You'd be lucky to have her.

15:04.975 --> 15:06.344
Bonnie.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.724
Good work.

15:12.724 --> 15:15.630
Just one thing. I noticed that
when you wrote "cosine,"

15:15.630 --> 15:18.468
you dotted your "I"
with a daisy.

15:18.468 --> 15:21.307
I, uh, have a sister
who used to do that.

15:21.307 --> 15:24.347
Well, Kyle and I helped.

15:24.347 --> 15:27.520
And I like to give each letter
a little personality.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.092
Yeah, but Boyd was with us
the whole time.

15:30.092 --> 15:31.762
And when we finished the work,

15:31.762 --> 15:33.933
he felt really good
about himself.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.170
‐I do feel good.
‐Mm.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.272
And isn't that what's important?

15:37.272 --> 15:39.043
Boyd, go to your room.

15:39.043 --> 15:42.082
Guess it isn't.

15:42.082 --> 15:44.453
Let me guess, he had you do
all his homework for him

15:44.453 --> 15:46.625
because he said
he was too stupid to do it?

15:46.625 --> 15:49.564
Yeah. And gave you
his sad puppy dog eyes?

15:49.564 --> 15:53.438
How did you know? (gasps)
Did you even go to Aspen?

15:53.438 --> 15:55.943
No. It's how he gets out
of doing things.

15:55.943 --> 15:57.479
Yeah, he's a bright kid,
but, lately,

15:57.479 --> 15:59.584
he uses it to avoid doing work.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.822
Wow. You know,
now I'm starting to wonder

16:01.822 --> 16:03.491
if he really couldn't wash
the dishes

16:03.491 --> 16:06.431
because he's
"too sensitive to water."

16:06.431 --> 16:10.005
(laughs) Yeah.
Ryan told me about your, uh,

16:10.005 --> 16:11.942
‐"let's be friends"
parenting theory.
‐Yeah.

16:11.942 --> 16:13.512
RYAN:
Rookie mistake, guys.

16:13.512 --> 16:15.282
Look, he has plenty of friends,
all right?

16:15.282 --> 16:16.919
We need to be his parents.

16:16.919 --> 16:18.956
It's not always fun,
but it's what he needs.

16:18.956 --> 16:21.962
Parenting is actually harder
than it looks.

16:21.962 --> 16:23.465
Like math.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.208
You might want to finish
checking those answers.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.945
No, Boyd will.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.882
And we will make sure
he gets it right.

16:31.882 --> 16:33.986
Really? I'm so sorry.

16:33.986 --> 16:37.125
It's okay. You were trying to
help. And at the end of the day,

16:37.125 --> 16:40.733
(mimics Vin Diesel):
we're family.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.906
Can everybody do Vin Diesel?

16:43.906 --> 16:46.745
(bad New York accent):
"We're family."

16:46.745 --> 16:48.816
Family. We're family.

16:51.153 --> 16:53.091
Oh, Mom, do you have to leave?

16:53.091 --> 16:54.995
Oh, there's really nothing
to keep me here, dear.

16:54.995 --> 16:57.466
Wh‐Wh‐What does that mean?
I mean, Ed's gone,

16:57.466 --> 16:59.704
but we could spend
more time together.

16:59.704 --> 17:02.810
I'm really surprised
to hear you say that.

17:02.810 --> 17:06.785
It‐it seems like you always need
someone to be with us,

17:06.785 --> 17:10.660
like a... oh, I don't know,
like a buffer.

17:10.660 --> 17:13.464
(scoffs) That's ridiculous.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.068
All right, all right. You...

17:15.068 --> 17:18.976
I‐I‐I just feel like every time
we're alone,

17:18.976 --> 17:21.314
all you do is judge me.

17:21.314 --> 17:24.688
You think I judge you?

17:24.688 --> 17:26.792
Y‐Yeah, see? There. There. That.
That head tilt.

17:26.792 --> 17:29.029
Yeah. Every time you do it,

17:29.029 --> 17:31.868
I feel like that little girl
who lost the spelling bee.

17:31.868 --> 17:34.106
Huh? Vacuum has two "U"s?

17:34.106 --> 17:35.843
I mean, that's just weird.

17:37.346 --> 17:40.185
Sweetie,
I have a vision imbalance.

17:40.185 --> 17:43.324
Tilting my head helps me
see straight. (stammers)

17:43.324 --> 17:46.063
(sighs) Wh‐Why didn't you
tell me that before?

17:46.063 --> 17:48.134
I never know what to say to you.

17:48.134 --> 17:51.140
Whatever‐whatever it is,
it‐it's not interesting enough,

17:51.140 --> 17:52.510
or it's not smart enough.

17:52.510 --> 17:54.814
‐Oh, that's just stupid.
‐I just... I...

17:57.553 --> 17:59.858
Bad... bad choice of words.

17:59.858 --> 18:01.828
And‐and you're always taking
these little shots.

18:01.828 --> 18:03.498
You know, putting me down.

18:03.498 --> 18:05.836
Mom, I don't do that
to be superior to you.

18:05.836 --> 18:07.339
I do that to hurt you.

18:07.339 --> 18:09.678
Oh.

18:11.782 --> 18:14.988
I'm just not great
with the talking today.

18:14.988 --> 18:18.996
Do you have any idea
how intimidating you can be?

18:18.996 --> 18:20.666
To you?

18:20.666 --> 18:22.169
Yeah. Yeah, you know,

18:22.169 --> 18:24.239
one day, one day
I'm changing your diaper,

18:24.239 --> 18:27.079
and the next day you're this
accomplished woman with a PhD.

18:27.079 --> 18:29.884
And I only managed to go
to what? Two years of college.

18:29.884 --> 18:32.924
Mom, you‐you are the first woman

18:32.924 --> 18:35.428
in our family ever
to go to college.

18:35.428 --> 18:37.232
‐Well...
‐You...

18:37.232 --> 18:38.736
You've always been
my role model.

18:38.736 --> 18:41.273
(laughing):
I have? Really?

18:41.273 --> 18:42.844
Yeah, really.

18:42.844 --> 18:46.585
Is that what you wanted to talk
about at the... at lunch?

18:46.585 --> 18:48.956
‐Uh, yeah. Yeah.
‐Oh.

18:48.956 --> 18:52.195
Might... might take a few
lunches to sort everything out.

18:52.195 --> 18:54.466
‐Yeah.
‐You know, 'cause we...
we have been doing this

18:54.466 --> 18:56.437
‐for 30 years.
‐Ten years.

18:58.976 --> 19:01.347
Well, it might take
a few dinners, too.

19:01.347 --> 19:02.984
‐I think so.
‐Yeah.
‐(knocking on door)

19:02.984 --> 19:05.155
‐Oh.
‐Oh.

19:05.155 --> 19:08.161
Permission to enter a house full
of strong, beautiful women?

19:08.161 --> 19:10.165
‐Granted.
‐Oh.

19:10.165 --> 19:12.102
Bonnie, my dear.

19:12.102 --> 19:14.072
I apologize for before.

19:14.072 --> 19:16.076
That's not the man I want to be.

19:16.076 --> 19:18.181
I would be so lucky
to spend time

19:18.181 --> 19:20.553
with a woman of substance
like yourself.

19:20.553 --> 19:23.457
Oh. W‐Well, thank you.

19:23.457 --> 19:25.461
Th‐Th‐These are...
they're beautiful.

19:25.461 --> 19:28.100
‐Just beautiful.
‐Yes, Ed. Thank you.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.373
Perhaps we could go to
a museum tomorrow. Or dancing.

19:31.373 --> 19:33.745
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.
Sure. You kids, you go. Go.

19:33.745 --> 19:36.383
Very tempting, but I‐I think

19:36.383 --> 19:38.789
I'm going to spend the‐the day
with my daughter.

19:38.789 --> 19:40.759
We have a lot to talk about.

19:40.759 --> 19:42.329
Yes, we do.

19:42.329 --> 19:44.132
But another time?

19:44.132 --> 19:45.803
Of course.

19:45.803 --> 19:48.742
You know, for years
I've admired this apple.

19:50.311 --> 19:53.251
Imagine my delight
in getting to know the tree.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.811
‐He's lovely. He's just lovely.
‐Yes.

20:06.811 --> 20:08.515
Well, well, well. (grunts)

20:08.515 --> 20:10.552
Oh, now.

20:10.552 --> 20:12.990
What are we gonna do
about these?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.560
Hmm.

20:16.531 --> 20:19.369
Ah. There.
We made it better.

20:19.369 --> 20:22.576
‐Aw. My baby.
‐Oh, Mommy.

20:30.893 --> 20:33.598
Hey, Mike Baxter here for
Outdoor Man, with a word about

20:33.598 --> 20:37.072
the most powerful force ever
unleashed in the known universe:

20:37.072 --> 20:38.742
family.

20:38.742 --> 20:41.447
Yeah, there's a reason
they call it "nuclear family,"

20:41.447 --> 20:45.121
because only the people we love
can drop 50 megatons of guilt,

20:45.121 --> 20:48.795
resentment and judgment on us.

20:48.795 --> 20:51.868
And that's just at Christmas.

20:53.538 --> 20:56.778
Even so‐called happy families
have one or two people

20:56.778 --> 20:59.149
at the table who are basically
just enriched uranium

20:59.149 --> 21:03.057
in search of exploding‐
bridgewater detonators.

21:03.057 --> 21:06.330
I'm surprised
I could even say that.

21:06.330 --> 21:08.702
They say, "Did you enjoy
the mushroom soup?

21:08.702 --> 21:12.610
Now enjoy a mushroom cloud
of emotional destruction."

21:12.610 --> 21:15.883
Of course, the mother lode
in any family is,

21:15.883 --> 21:18.588
well, of course, the mother.

21:18.588 --> 21:22.095
Who else can turn your soul
into an irradiated blast zone

21:22.095 --> 21:26.036
with a well‐timed...
(sighing): "I don't know. I..."

21:26.036 --> 21:29.309
I mean, that is pure mom mojo.

21:29.309 --> 21:32.148
There's a simple reason
no one can push your buttons

21:32.148 --> 21:35.455
quite like your mother:
she sewed them on!

21:38.895 --> 21:40.331
(chicken clucking)

21:40.331 --> 21:42.335
