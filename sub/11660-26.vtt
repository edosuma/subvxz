01:00.533 --> 01:03.200
-You couldn't sleep either, Dorothy?
-No, Rose.

01:03.266 --> 01:06.700
Are you upset because Blanche
is selling the house?

01:06.767 --> 01:11.233
No, I'm upset because Joe Piscopo
didn't get the lead role in <i>Rain Man.</i>

01:12.433 --> 01:15.033
Of course, I'm upset about the house.

01:17.033 --> 01:19.900
Ma, it's 2 am, where have you been?

01:19.967 --> 01:23.734
I stuffed pillows under the sheets
to fool you during bed check.

01:23.800 --> 01:25.633
What is this, <i>Stalag 17</i>?

01:26.300 --> 01:32.333
-I couldn't sleep. I had a nightmare.
-Tell me about it. I can interpret dreams.

01:32.400 --> 01:36.066
Blanche sold the house,
and I wound up back at shady pines.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.734
This is a tough one.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.934
Dorothy, don't send me back!

01:41.033 --> 01:44.467
Ma, I'm not sending you
back to shady pines.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.800
Oh, my God.
She found a cheaper home!

01:47.867 --> 01:51.333
Blanche, please,
please, don't sell the house.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.600
What the hell is that
holding up your stockings?

01:55.934 --> 01:57.467
Get out of there.

01:57.967 --> 02:01.433
I know I told Mr. Yakamora
I'd sell the house,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.400
but it's not fair
to make that decision by myself.

02:04.467 --> 02:07.166
Tell me what to do.

02:07.233 --> 02:10.900
It's your house, Blanche.
You have to decide.

02:10.967 --> 02:15.533
Since when have you all been so shy?
We always tell each other what to do.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.367
-Honey, are you all right?
-I'll be fine.

02:19.934 --> 02:20.967
Is this about Arnie?

02:21.033 --> 02:25.133
No, Blanche, she's upset because
they keep changing the taste of coke.

02:32.033 --> 02:35.800
Arnie wants me to go away with him.
On a cruise to The Bahamas.

02:36.333 --> 02:37.333
Oh.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.166
Oh, and you're upset because he
wants you to pay your own way?

02:43.934 --> 02:47.700
I'm upset because we'll be all alone
in the middle of the ocean,

02:47.767 --> 02:51.934
on a ship, in a state room...
with a bed.

02:53.633 --> 02:54.834
Oh.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.867
I don't know what to do.

02:57.567 --> 02:58.700
I haven't...

02:59.567 --> 03:01.166
been with a man...

03:01.700 --> 03:06.333
-in that special way since Charlie died.
-Get out of here.

03:09.633 --> 03:10.900
Well, it's true.

03:11.533 --> 03:13.333
Charlie was the only lover I ever had

03:13.400 --> 03:15.734
and my first time was
on our wedding night.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.233
Get out of here.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.700
Oh, back off, Blanche.

03:20.767 --> 03:24.166
Not all of us are classified
by the navy as a friendly port.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.567
Maybe it sounds strange but...

03:31.233 --> 03:34.100
without Charlie, I thought that part
of my life was over.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.900
-I never gave it a second thought.
-Until now.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.200
Then I think you should
go on the cruise.

03:40.266 --> 03:42.767
Honey, if the situation is right,
you'll know it.

03:43.500 --> 03:44.633
But I'm not sure I'm ready.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.333
Oh, honey, I know what you're going
through.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.333
The bottom line is:
If you take a chance in life

03:50.400 --> 03:53.467
sometimes good things happen,
sometimes bad things happen.

03:53.533 --> 03:56.233
But, honey, if you don't take a chance,
nothing happens.

03:59.166 --> 04:00.467
I'm gonna take a chance.

04:00.533 --> 04:02.633
-Wonderful.
-Great.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.533
Oh, I have to look in my closet,

04:04.600 --> 04:07.600
I don't even know what to wear
the first night on the ship.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.734
A lifejacket and a great big smile.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.000
I wonder what Rose is doing right now?

04:16.066 --> 04:18.533
You mean you wonder
if she's doing it right now.

04:19.934 --> 04:23.600
I hope we didn't push her
into something too fast.

04:23.667 --> 04:28.200
How in the world did she manage
to wait 15 years?

04:29.033 --> 04:33.500
-How long did you wait after George died?
-Till the paramedics came.

04:33.567 --> 04:34.633
Ma.

04:42.834 --> 04:46.333
What about you, Dorothy?
Who was the first after Stan?

04:46.400 --> 04:49.233
-Blanche...
-Her divorce lawyer.

04:49.900 --> 04:53.200
-How did you know?
-It's always the divorce lawyer.

04:54.500 --> 04:59.066
It was terrible.
I'd gone on an eating binge

04:59.133 --> 05:02.734
and put on quite a bit of weight,
plus I was not a 20-year-old.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.500
When you're 20, no matter what you do,
everything stays where it's supposed to.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.734
Now, when you lean over

05:10.800 --> 05:14.033
it looks like somebody's let the air
out of your face.

05:16.867 --> 05:21.467
-What?
-Lean over a mirror and look at yourself.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.100
-Where's a mirror.
-In the tool drawer.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.066
You'd better take
a sedative before you look.

05:27.700 --> 05:32.533
I look at my face all the time.
How different could it be leaning over?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.967
Oh, my God!

05:35.600 --> 05:39.734
Oh, my God, Dorothy!
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

05:40.700 --> 05:43.266
Only on your back, Blanche.

05:43.333 --> 05:47.567
That way everything slides back and you
look like you've just had a facelift.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.433
Oh, you're right. I'm gorgeous.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.233
I'm going to have to meet men lying down.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.100
I thought you did.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.033
Of course, that way,
not only does your face fall back,

06:05.100 --> 06:06.767
but your chest does, too.

06:08.433 --> 06:12.500
Unfortunately, it falls back
and off to the side.

06:17.567 --> 06:21.967
-We might as well get some sleep.
-I can't sleep.

06:22.033 --> 06:25.467
I'm wound up tighter than the girdle
on a Baptist minister's wife

06:25.533 --> 06:27.767
at a pancake breakfast.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.633
Wow, that tight.

06:32.166 --> 06:38.767
Back in St. Olaf, when I couldn't sleep,
I'd have a glass of warm milk,

06:38.834 --> 06:42.867
slip under the covers,
and count cows jumping over my bed.

06:43.734 --> 06:45.533
It usually worked like a charm...

06:46.000 --> 06:49.800
except when a cow with a low udder

06:49.867 --> 06:52.667
would brush across my forehead
and wake me up.

06:54.300 --> 06:58.700
I don't know what I'm going to do.
I'm torn and confused.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.333
I'll have to think about it tomorrow.

07:01.667 --> 07:05.400
-After all, tomorrow's another day.
-Calm down, Scarlet.

07:05.467 --> 07:10.934
-There's no need to be so dramatic.
-Everyone around here acts like a ham.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.533
There's been more
bad acting, bad dancing,

07:13.600 --> 07:17.000
and bad singing under this roof
than a Suzanne Somer's special.

07:19.033 --> 07:24.300
(peppy music playing)

07:26.934 --> 07:28.000
Rose.

07:32.734 --> 07:33.967
Blanche.

07:38.533 --> 07:41.367
-Dorothy.
-Go, Dorothy, go!

07:52.033 --> 07:54.900
Gosh, I didn't realize
how long Dorothy's solo is.

07:57.266 --> 08:00.200
I sure hope the doctor says
she's going to be all right.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.266
I won't dance. Don't ask me.

08:13.233 --> 08:14.266
Pay attention.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.767
-You're in for a treat.
-Ma, not another act.

08:17.834 --> 08:20.233
Not just another act. The act.

08:20.300 --> 08:23.600
I've taken a classic
and reworked it Sophia-style.

Stinky.

in my house.

-It belongs in a barnyard.
-This isn't a farm chicken.

09:24.967 --> 09:29.033
Count Bessie's a show biz chicken.
Watch this.

09:29.100 --> 09:32.233
A show biz chicken.
Does she play the piano?

09:33.300 --> 09:35.033
She plays the piano.

09:39.834 --> 09:44.400
-You just wait and see this.
-Ok, honey. Come on, it's Showtime.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.433
Yeah. Come on, sweetheart.
Oh, I know.

09:47.500 --> 09:51.567

09:51.633 --> 09:55.667
(plays "Old MacDonald")

09:58.266 --> 10:02.100
Isn't she incredible?
What do you say? Can she stay?

10:02.166 --> 10:05.133
I guess so. All right.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.500
Just be sure and keep her in her cage.

10:07.567 --> 10:10.200
Maybe I can convince the count

10:10.266 --> 10:12.967
to give us some
live entertainment with dessert.

10:13.500 --> 10:16.633
-Have you any requests?
-How about "Bye Bye, Birdie"?

10:19.300 --> 10:21.800
Girls, girls, count Bessie is missing.

10:24.467 --> 10:27.867
I went out to the garage to feed her,
and her cage was empty.

10:27.934 --> 10:29.266
Where could she be?

10:47.100 --> 10:48.967
Aunt Angelo.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.900
-Where did you get this chicken?
-The garage.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.266
I guess this means no live entertainment
with dessert.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.633
-How did you do?
-We came in second.

11:10.700 --> 11:14.600
-That's terrific. What did you get?
-Treated badly.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.200
They told us to get out of the way

11:17.266 --> 11:19.667
when they took the winner's picture
with Anita Bryant.

11:20.300 --> 11:24.934
-I'd love to hear your song.
-Oh, forget it, Blanche.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.166
The whole experience was too painful.

11:27.233 --> 11:29.300
-Please.
-We want to forget it.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.800
-Please.

(calm music playing)

13:09.734 --> 13:14.600
You're upset about this house business.
There's only one thing you can do.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.800
What's that?

13:15.867 --> 13:18.734
Take the advice of a wise old Sicilian.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.033
-You, Sophia?
-No. Charlie callas.

13:21.967 --> 13:25.867
My father had a similar problem
when selling real estate.

13:25.934 --> 13:28.934
I didn't know grandpa
ever owned real estate.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.867
He didn't. That was the problem.

13:30.934 --> 13:33.266
It turned out he didn't really
own the Vatican.

13:35.066 --> 13:40.100
Although he did have a very close friend
who swore he was there

13:40.166 --> 13:43.900
when pop won the deed in a card game
from Pope Ronnie, the magnificent.

13:44.633 --> 13:50.467
-Sophia, you're not making any sense.
-Excuse me, Mrs. Kierkegaard. It's 4am.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.500
Is there a point?

13:53.767 --> 13:57.500
And if there wasn't, will you put
decorative bars on my window?

13:57.567 --> 13:58.834
Yes, there's a point.

13:58.900 --> 14:02.300
If you sell real estate,
make sure you own it.

14:02.367 --> 14:05.033
-I do own this house.
-Oh.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.333
Is anybody else hungry?

14:07.800 --> 14:12.033
-I could really go for a pizza.
-I've been thinking about Chinese.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.333
-How about a burger and fries?
-Let's order it all.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.834
Oh, Sophia, that's crazy.

14:17.900 --> 14:22.233
This would be the first time
we did something out of the ordinary?

14:25.900 --> 14:29.834
-Ma, thank God you're here!
-Arrested for prostitution.

14:29.900 --> 14:32.066
-I can't believe it.
-Oh, Sophia.

14:33.066 --> 14:34.667
Sophia, we're innocent.

14:34.734 --> 14:36.700
I can't believe these dumb cops

14:36.767 --> 14:38.800
would think anyone would pay money
to sleep with you.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.433
Did you come to bail us out?

14:46.500 --> 14:50.166
No. She's dropping off a manicotti
with a file in it.

14:51.133 --> 14:55.300
We'll see Burt Reynolds after all.
These tickets won't go to waste.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.400
Which of you isn't going?

15:01.767 --> 15:06.967
-Well, I'm the one who won the tickets.
-My mom's the one who's bailing us out.

15:07.033 --> 15:10.166
I lost butter queen.
Haven't I suffered enough?

15:10.767 --> 15:13.367
-We'll... we'll draw straws.
-No.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.200
-We'll flip a coin.
-No.

15:15.266 --> 15:18.100
Sophia, try and be understanding.

15:18.166 --> 15:21.967
I came down here to bail you out,
and you're not letting me go?

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
-Get us out of here!
-Where are your roommates?

15:27.533 --> 15:29.500
-They're not here.
-Ma!

15:30.000 --> 15:32.400
Don't ma me, you cheap floozy.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.166
You'd do this to
your own flesh and blood?

15:37.233 --> 15:40.600
You'll get over it.
If you don't, who cares?

15:40.667 --> 15:42.533
I'm going to see Burt Reynolds!

15:46.700 --> 15:48.467
You're going to love this.

15:48.533 --> 15:54.166
-Dom Deluise insist I tell Burt the story.
-I don't want to hear about it.

15:54.233 --> 15:56.533
Not even the part when Burt and Dom
insisted

15:56.600 --> 15:58.533
I repeat the story to Loni Anderson?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.934
I don't want to hear not another word.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.233
Cinderella's back from the ball, and her
three wicked roommates are jealous.

16:09.834 --> 16:14.433
We are not jealous. We are angry.
You left us in jail.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.500
I sent over the bail money.
You were out an hour later.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.400
I think that was just about the time

16:19.467 --> 16:22.433
I was nibbling a giant shrimp
out of Jerry Reed's hand.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.166
You're making this whole
thing up just to rub it in.

16:26.233 --> 16:28.433
You have never met these people.

16:29.934 --> 16:35.166
Jealousy is a very ugly thing, Dorothy.
And so are you in anything backless.

16:38.567 --> 16:41.467
(doorbell rings)

16:44.300 --> 16:45.700
Hello.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.266
-Sophia around?
-Oh, hi, Burt.

17:08.834 --> 17:12.367
-How about a little lunch?
-How about a big lunch?

17:13.200 --> 17:16.767
My God, you're Mr. Burt Reynolds.

17:16.834 --> 17:19.133
I hope so, otherwise
I'm wearing the wrong underwear.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.834
-These the roommates you mentioned?
-Yeah.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.633
-Which one's the slut?
-(all) I am.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.834
-Rose, it is not here.
-It has to be.

17:35.900 --> 17:39.834
I've read every want ad. Mine isn't here.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.400
Are you sure you dropped it off
at the newspaper office?

17:42.467 --> 17:46.233
You told me what you wanted
a dozen times.

17:46.300 --> 17:47.500
Any idiot could've done it.

17:47.567 --> 17:50.433
I know, but you were
the only one going downtown.

17:51.934 --> 17:55.166
You're sure you dropped it off
at the newspaper office?

17:55.233 --> 17:58.300
Six people already called
while you were out.

17:58.367 --> 18:00.500
I'll find it for you.

18:00.567 --> 18:02.433
(doorbell rings)

18:07.000 --> 18:08.867
-Dorothy?
-Have we met?

18:09.166 --> 18:11.934
Not yet. I'm here because of your ad.

18:12.000 --> 18:17.400
-"Willing to do anything. $8.00 an hour."
-Yes. Please come in.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.900
I didn't expect people
to actually come here.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.867
I figured I would be going to them.

18:22.934 --> 18:27.700
That's how it'll work in the future
when my video camera is fixed.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.867
What type of work
do you need done, Mr., um...

18:31.934 --> 18:33.100
-Toto.
-Mr. Toto.

18:33.166 --> 18:37.967
Oh, no mister. Just Toto.
You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.500
At least for the next $8.

18:47.734 --> 18:50.734
Dorothy, you owe me an apology.
Your ad's right here.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.800
-This is the personals column.
-So what?

18:54.867 --> 18:57.367
You put an ad in the personals column

18:57.433 --> 19:00.333
that said I will do anything
for $8 an hour?

19:01.166 --> 19:03.767
It's right under an ad that reads...

19:04.400 --> 19:07.834
"History professor seeking
nonsmoking oriental woman

19:07.900 --> 19:12.633
who is into Wesson oil and bears
a resemblance to Florence Henderson."

19:14.333 --> 19:16.166
-Is that signed "Doug"?
-Yes.

19:16.233 --> 19:18.567
I know him. He's a sick man.

19:19.934 --> 19:23.133
I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
Goodbye.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.400
Oh, my God. I don't believe this.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.734
I'm going to call the cops
if you don't get out of here, you pervert.

19:33.800 --> 19:37.867
Hi, father Rossi.
Here's the canned goods for the needy.

19:39.233 --> 19:40.300
Oh, no.

19:41.700 --> 19:43.867
Oh, I'm... I'm terribly sorry.

19:43.934 --> 19:47.500
I'll say Hail Marys until Madonna
has a hit movie.

19:51.300 --> 19:54.367
Hi. Here's my $8.
Let's get started, Dorothy.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.066
I'm not Dorothy. She is.

19:57.266 --> 19:58.967
I'll give you $4. Let's get started.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.867
How would you like your rear end
kicked across the street?

20:04.934 --> 20:06.700
Oh, great. Here's the other $4.

20:09.066 --> 20:11.400
Girls.
Girls!

20:11.467 --> 20:14.533
There's a busload
of Greek sailors out front.

20:16.266 --> 20:19.400
They want to know how many
drachma there are in $8.

20:21.900 --> 20:26.066
Girls, guess what I found. Fernando.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.700
-That's not Fernando.
-What do you mean?

20:30.767 --> 20:34.233
-How could you tell?
-You just have to look in his eyes.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.033
Or at the price tag stuck to his back.

20:39.633 --> 20:42.600
-Oops.
-Thanks, Blanche.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.433
It's nice to know I have a friend like
you...

20:45.767 --> 20:46.867
who cares.

20:49.667 --> 20:54.100
-Dorothy, I have a confession to make.
-Rose didn't lose Fernando.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.867
I gave him to Daisy when she was helping
with the rummage sale.

20:57.934 --> 21:00.000
Well, then there's no problem.

21:00.066 --> 21:04.600
Just call Daisy and get Fernando back.
She's sweet. She'll understand.

21:04.667 --> 21:08.967
-I tried that. She said no.
-What do you mean?

21:09.033 --> 21:12.767
She's not sweet anymore.
She's holding Fernando for ransom.

21:13.867 --> 21:17.800
-Come on.
-Dorothy, she sent me one of his ears.

21:25.433 --> 21:27.033
-You.
-Good morning.

21:27.100 --> 21:31.900
-What do you want?
-I was wrong to ask for all those gifts.

21:31.967 --> 21:35.900
-She came to her senses.
-I decided cash is better.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.900
That way, I can buy exactly what I want.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.834
-I'll get my purse.
-No.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.867
I won't let you do that.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.567
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

21:48.033 --> 21:51.333
If after all the years of companionship,

21:51.400 --> 21:54.767
Fernando and I are meant to part company,
I'll have to accept that.

21:55.367 --> 21:59.000
From time to time,
life deals you an unfriendly hand.

21:59.066 --> 22:00.633
There's nothing you can do.

22:01.667 --> 22:03.266
There's a lesson to be learned.

22:04.567 --> 22:07.133
Sometimes life just isn't fair, kiddo.

22:18.400 --> 22:20.533
I cannot talk about this anymore.

22:20.800 --> 22:23.633
I'll call Yakamora
and give him my decision.

22:23.700 --> 22:27.467
-Make your call.
-We'll go in the other room.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.066
Come on, Ma. Let's go.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.767
-What will she do?
-I think she'll sell.

22:34.834 --> 22:37.867
-It's too much money.
-Blanche is too sentimental.

22:37.934 --> 22:40.767
-I think she'll stay.
-What do you think, Ma?

22:40.834 --> 22:42.667
-Ma!
-Quiet.

22:42.734 --> 22:47.333
Oh, this is just the operator.
Your phone is working fine.

22:48.734 --> 22:52.467
-What did you hear?
-You'll never believe what happened.

22:52.533 --> 22:54.467
You'll never believe what happened.

22:54.533 --> 22:58.467
-Yakamora decided not to buy the house.
-What happened?

22:58.533 --> 23:02.200
He went on a shopping spree
and spent all this money.

23:02.266 --> 23:05.533
He bought a department store
in Fort Lauderdale,

23:05.600 --> 23:09.200
and a condominium in Orlando,
a baseball team in Tampa,

23:09.266 --> 23:11.467
and I think one of the Landers sisters.

23:12.100 --> 23:17.033
-What if he hadn't backed out?
-What difference does that make?

23:17.100 --> 23:19.900
The important thing
is we're staying together.

23:19.967 --> 23:23.033
-You were going to sell, right?
-Damn straight.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.700
But I wouldn't let it break us up.

23:26.100 --> 23:30.900
We are staying together. We are family.
We are a team.

23:32.367 --> 23:34.767
Come on, everybody. Group hug.

23:43.300 --> 23:48.166
(theme music playing)
