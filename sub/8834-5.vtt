Shere Khan hires only the best pilots.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.375
We fly for Khan,
therefore we are the best.

01:30.500 --> 01:32.917
Hey, man, easy on the haberdashery.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.792
Pardon me, but which are the best:
The freelancers or Khan's pilots?

01:37.875 --> 01:38.750
[airplane approaching]

01:39.917 --> 01:43.875
[laughing]
There's your answer right there, man.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.083
The world's primo pilot, Baloo.

01:47.166 --> 01:51.583
Snow or warm, pirates or storm,
that guy can handle anything.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.625
You wanna meet him?

01:53.083 --> 01:57.208
Hey, Louie, trimmed your hedges
for you on the way in.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.875
[chuckles]
Thanks, cousin.

01:59.959 --> 02:02.792

But first, I want to introduce

02:12.625 --> 02:15.125
a new fan to my main man.

02:15.208 --> 02:17.750
Allow me to present...

02:17.834 --> 02:21.125
Ah, well, he was here a second ago.

02:22.458 --> 02:23.750
Ha!

02:24.417 --> 02:27.542

02:40.458 --> 02:42.125
[Baloo] Plane-nappers!

02:42.208 --> 02:45.875
-Becky! Call the cops!
-Uh-oh.

02:58.458 --> 03:01.000
Your joyride's over, you dirty...
Huh?

03:02.041 --> 03:03.875
[buzzing]

03:03.959 --> 03:06.959
-What do you want?
-What do I want?

03:07.041 --> 03:09.417
Who do you think you...
[yells]

03:09.500 --> 03:11.250
Uh, can we talk?

03:12.208 --> 03:15.041
That is Professor Martin Tork.

03:15.125 --> 03:18.375
He's rented the <i>Sea Duck</i>
for a large amount of money,

03:18.458 --> 03:21.542
to test his new invention,
the Auto Aviator.

03:21.625 --> 03:25.667
That overgrown blender's
gonna fly my airplane?

03:25.750 --> 03:29.291
No. That overgrown blender's
gonna fly my airplane.

03:29.375 --> 03:32.834
Now get back in there and apologize,
and try to be nice.

03:34.834 --> 03:37.250
Nice is my middle name.

03:37.333 --> 03:42.542
Hey, sorry about busting in
on you like that. Baloo's the name.

03:44.208 --> 03:47.041
Uh, so, quite a gadget you got there.

03:47.125 --> 03:51.583
This gadget, as you call it,
represents the future of aviation.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.917
Yeah, and I'm the propeller fairy.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.917
Unlike ordinary pilots, the Auto Aviator
never deviates from its flight plan.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.750
It is the ultimate pilot.

04:00.834 --> 04:01.917
Ultimate pilot.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.291
-It's efficient.
-Efficient.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.917
-Obedient.
-Obedient.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.583
-Stupid.
-Stupid.

04:06.667 --> 04:10.000
Hey, I'm starting to like this boy.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.291
[yells]

04:14.000 --> 04:17.000
The Auto Aviator is designed
to repulse interference.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.375
It must've sensed hostile intent.

04:19.458 --> 04:23.291
[groans]
I'll show him hostile intent.

04:23.375 --> 04:27.500
[chuckles]
Now, no hard feelings.

04:27.583 --> 04:31.500
Say, did Becky tell you
about the alterations

04:31.583 --> 04:33.458
I've made in this plane?

04:33.542 --> 04:35.125
Such as?

04:35.208 --> 04:38.500
Oh, for instance,
like that blue button there.

04:38.583 --> 04:43.792
That button's OK,
but never ever touch that red button.

04:43.875 --> 04:46.375
<i>Blue button, OK.</i>
<i>Red button, bad.</i>

04:46.458 --> 04:47.959
[yells]

04:48.041 --> 04:52.875
Oh, or is it the red button's good
and the blue button's bad?

04:52.959 --> 04:55.041
[grunting]

04:56.041 --> 05:00.125
After this test is over,
we'll see who's clever.

05:01.125 --> 05:03.333
[Baloo]
They've been gone for hours.

05:03.417 --> 05:07.458
My poor baby's probably just
a mile-long pile of parts by now.

05:07.542 --> 05:10.208
-[airplane approaching]
-Not necessarily. Here she comes.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.792
With or without wings?

05:12.875 --> 05:16.000
Wow! That robot can fly.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.750
I mean, it flies OK for a machine.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.166
Baloo! Wait up!

05:26.041 --> 05:27.625
-Gangway!
-Out of the way!

05:27.709 --> 05:29.709
Reporters? Who called them?

05:29.792 --> 05:31.834
One guess.

05:31.917 --> 05:33.667
-[man 1] A mechanical pilot?
-[man 2] Hey, over here.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.750
What's it called?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.583
All right, all right.
I will answer all your questions.

05:37.667 --> 05:41.125
But first, I'd like to introduce
that ace of the skies:

05:41.208 --> 05:43.208
Baloo, come on up here.

05:43.291 --> 05:47.041
-What?
-Take a good look, boys.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.917
Before you is the best pilot
there ever was.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.166
Well, now, since you put it that way...

05:53.250 --> 05:55.375
-[man 1] This way, ace!
-[man 2] Come on, give us... over here.

05:55.458 --> 05:58.542
Yes. Here they are.
Together for the last time,

05:58.625 --> 06:01.792
the pilot of the past
with the pilot of the future:

06:01.875 --> 06:03.792
the Auto Aviator.

06:03.875 --> 06:09.125
Now wait a minute!
That overgrown waffle iron is no pilot.

06:09.208 --> 06:14.458
A real pilot can handle storms
and air pirates and stuff like that.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.750
My pilot can fly day and night.

06:16.834 --> 06:22.166
It never eats, never sleeps,
never deviates from its flight path.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.625
You and your kind are like the dinosaurs:

06:24.709 --> 06:28.625
decaying, defective, and defunct.

06:28.709 --> 06:32.041
Oh, yeah? Well, defunct this!

06:35.834 --> 06:39.500
Ooh, such a crude individual.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.792
A mindless menial, Mr. Khan.

06:41.875 --> 06:44.250
The tests are complete.
My machine is perfect.

06:44.333 --> 06:48.959
Shall I put you down
for say a dozen Auto Aviators?

06:49.041 --> 06:51.375
I haven't said I'd buy anything.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.583
Baloo may be correct,

06:53.667 --> 06:57.375
perhaps your robot
can't handle all situations.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.208
Are you going to believe
that barnstormer?

07:00.291 --> 07:02.333
[Khan]
Calm yourself, professor.

07:02.417 --> 07:07.959
If there were a test against a real pilot
and the Auto Aviator won,

07:08.041 --> 07:13.083
I might consider buying, say,
1,000 of your mechanical men.

07:13.166 --> 07:16.041
-A thousand?
-Think about it.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.500
-[Tork] But... but...
-[Khan] Good evening.

07:20.750 --> 07:24.542
All right, Mr. Khan,
I'll prove I built the perfect pilot.

07:24.625 --> 07:27.834
And in the process, I'll destroy Baloo.

07:27.917 --> 07:30.375
Destroy Baloo.

07:41.041 --> 07:45.125
Great, Baloo. Your little outburst
played right into Tork's plan.

07:45.208 --> 07:47.709
You mean he wanted a black eye?

07:47.792 --> 07:52.333
He wanted to get on the front page
and you got him there.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.542
You can't let
every little insult upset you.

07:54.625 --> 07:57.500
You've got to stay
calm, cool, composed like me.

07:57.583 --> 08:02.041
So why are you running around like a
chicken with your feathers in a knot?

08:02.125 --> 08:06.542
Because I'm expecting a visit
from a very important client.

08:06.625 --> 08:10.041
-Short guy, glasses, bad toupee?
-Yes.

08:10.125 --> 08:13.125
-Somebody beat you to it.
-What?

08:14.041 --> 08:17.792
-Stop touching my client!
-He's my client now.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.125
That's ridiculous.
Isn't it?

08:21.208 --> 08:26.583
Well, actually, Professor Tork
convinced me that I need an Auto Aviator.

08:26.667 --> 08:30.583
It's cheaper than your
old-fashioned cargo service.

08:30.667 --> 08:34.041
But we've had phone calls,
meetings, lunches.

08:34.125 --> 08:38.291
I've listened to your
frozen okra stories for a solid week!

08:38.375 --> 08:41.667
Easy, miss calm and composed.

08:41.750 --> 08:46.000
Look, Doc, I'm tired of hearing
about that tin-plated doohickey.

08:46.083 --> 08:49.667
Are you challenging my Auto Aviator?

08:49.750 --> 08:51.834
Well... yeah.

08:51.917 --> 08:56.750
Aah, a contest for the future of aviation.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.166
Baloo versus the Auto Aviator.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.291
The winner will be
the world's best pilot.

09:03.375 --> 09:06.375
And may the best pilot win.

09:13.208 --> 09:16.583
All right, here are the rules:
You fly to Tundra City,

09:16.667 --> 09:19.000
pick up the cargo
and return to Cape Suzette.

09:19.083 --> 09:22.417
Round trip about 40 hours.
Any questions?

09:22.500 --> 09:26.625
Yeah. Why don't you start sewing
my name on the winner's sash?

09:26.709 --> 09:30.375
That's Baloo with two "oo's."

<i>On your marks...</i>

09:36.709 --> 09:39.875
Don't blow this race, Baloo,
or Khan's pilots will be out of jobs.

09:39.959 --> 09:43.792
Don't blow it, Baloo,
or us freelance pilots'll be out of jobs.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.125
[man on PA]
<i>Get set...</i>

09:45.208 --> 09:48.208
You lose this one
and Higher for Hire's out of business.

<i>Go!</i>

-Don't worry, little britches,

09:58.250 --> 10:02.959
with Papa Bear at the controls
this contest is no contest.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.667
I sure hope so.

10:30.542 --> 10:36.125
[yawns] I should have gotten me
some more shut-eye last night.

10:47.333 --> 10:51.417
Oh, man.
This race is gettin' to be a drag.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.875
Where's the cargo?

11:00.750 --> 11:04.959

a couple of winks couldn't hurt.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.917
<i>Khan Industries are working</i>
<i>around the clock.</i>

13:57.000 --> 14:01.542
<i>Cheap and efficient, these amazing robots</i>
<i>have taken over the skies.</i>

14:01.625 --> 14:03.917
<i>The city's other shipping companies</i>
<i>are grounded</i>

14:04.000 --> 14:06.875
<i>and their pilots are out of work,</i>

14:07.000 --> 14:10.583
<i>left without a wing or a prayer.</i>

14:26.375 --> 14:29.458
Amazing. I love this doodad.

14:29.542 --> 14:32.250
A mechanical pilot.
It flies here, it flies there.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.542
And always in a straight line.
[chuckles]

14:35.625 --> 14:38.250
They call it the modern day miracle.

14:38.333 --> 14:44.208
Well, my plundering protegees,
I call it the sitting duck.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.291
Well, I guess that does it.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.542
Yes, I know what I owe you,
I just can't pay.

14:54.625 --> 14:56.625
Business is slow for everyone.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.917
What? Same to you, buddy!

15:00.000 --> 15:01.959
Uh, wrong number.

15:02.041 --> 15:05.709
Mommy, Wildcat's telling fibs.

15:05.792 --> 15:10.083
He said we're gonna close.
He said Baloo's going away.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.917
Wildcat's not fibbing, doll.

15:13.000 --> 15:17.792
No! You can't go!
I won't let you! [sniffling]

15:17.875 --> 15:19.333
I won't let you.

15:19.417 --> 15:24.291
Molly, try to understand.
I can't compete with Khan's robots.

15:24.375 --> 15:28.041
Are... are we gonna be poor?

15:28.125 --> 15:32.250
No, we're not.
A broker's coming over to help us.

15:32.333 --> 15:36.166
He's going to buy the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

15:36.834 --> 15:37.959
What?

15:38.041 --> 15:41.166
Let it go,
little britches, let it go.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.709
You could've warned him.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.709
Given him a chance to say goodbye.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.417
I wanted to. It's just...

15:50.542 --> 15:55.208
I wish I'd never rented
the <i>Sea Duck </i> to that lousy inventor.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.458
[airplane approaching]

15:57.542 --> 16:00.458
Oh, great! The broker.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.709
Catch!

16:02.417 --> 16:05.959
The keys to the <i>Sea Duck?</i>
What are these for?

16:06.041 --> 16:08.333
For Baloo. Tell him to take
the plane for a spin

16:08.417 --> 16:10.709
and tell him to go fishing.
Just tell him to hurry.

16:10.834 --> 16:15.875
Why, hello. I meant to call.
We had to get the <i>Sea Duck...</i>

16:22.166 --> 16:26.834
A toast to the Auto Aviator,
the greatest invention in history.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.667
Indeed.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.667
[Don Karnage] <i>Hello, robot person.</i>

16:30.750 --> 16:34.500
<i>It is I, the spectaculus Don Karnage.</i>

16:34.583 --> 16:38.417
My bloodthirsty hoard and I
are on an intercept course with you.

16:38.500 --> 16:44.000
We will be shooting you and looting you
in precisely ten minutes.

16:44.083 --> 16:45.250
Felicitations.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.542
[chuckles]
Boy, I am one scary guy.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.709
Professor, you may instruct your robot

16:53.792 --> 16:57.166
to change course and evade the pirates.

16:58.291 --> 17:02.291
Turn right. Come to course 1-4-0.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.458
Deviation from flight plan
is unacceptable.

17:05.541 --> 17:08.541
This is your inventor speaking.
Turn right!

17:08.625 --> 17:11.458
Deviation from flight plan
is unacceptable.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.125
[yells]

17:14.208 --> 17:15.875
Problems, professor?

17:15.959 --> 17:21.458
Yeah, well, actually,
I wasn't expecting to deal with pirates.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.208
A perfect pilot must handle any situation.

17:25.333 --> 17:30.000
You told me your tin men were perfect.

17:30.083 --> 17:35.083
-But what do you want me to do?
-I suggest you call for help.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.458
[thunder rumbles]

17:37.542 --> 17:41.792
Why do you guys even hang out
with a loser like me?

17:41.875 --> 17:44.250
Come on.
We like being with you.

17:44.333 --> 17:47.583
Well, you're our buddy.
You're the best.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.417
Besides, we got nothing else to do.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.875
Oh, sorry.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.583
[Tork] <i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>
<i>This is Shere Khan's plane calling.</i>

17:55.667 --> 17:59.208
-Help!
-Oh, sit down.

17:59.291 --> 18:03.417
Whoever's listening, your assistance
will be handsomely rewarded.

18:03.500 --> 18:07.333
In a few moments, we'll be attacked
by pirates near Mount Rezika.

18:07.417 --> 18:11.500
Well, that's just north of here.
Baloo, shouldn't we do something?

18:11.834 --> 18:13.375
No, thank you.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.417
Let Tork's wonder widgets
save their hides.

18:16.500 --> 18:20.625
Oh, pity.
Those pirates'll cut 'em to ribbons.

18:20.709 --> 18:23.125
Slice 'em to smithereens.

18:25.166 --> 18:30.792
Yeah. Blast 'em into itty-bitty,
teenie-weenie, little, tiny whiney...

18:30.875 --> 18:33.125
[Kit] Well, of course,
a real pilot could save 'em.

18:33.208 --> 18:36.125
Now, where could we find
a pilot who could--

18:36.208 --> 18:38.750
All right. I get the message.

18:38.834 --> 18:40.709
Come on. We're flying.

18:42.959 --> 18:46.125
[Tork] This is your inventor speaking,
take evasive--

18:46.208 --> 18:47.333
-[buzzing]
-[yells]

18:48.083 --> 18:51.000
[robot] Deviation from flight plan
is unacceptable.

18:51.083 --> 18:54.667
I am losing patience, professor.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.834
[groans]

18:59.792 --> 19:02.250
As soon as I'm aboard,
get her out of here.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.041
-You got it?
-Got it.

19:10.834 --> 19:12.417
[buzzing]

19:12.500 --> 19:13.625
[banging on door]

19:13.709 --> 19:16.000
Pirates! We're doomed!

19:16.083 --> 19:18.875
How are you, boys?
How's it going?

19:23.250 --> 19:26.583
Ah, Baloo, we've hit a bit of a snag

19:26.667 --> 19:29.834
with the professor's contraption.

19:29.917 --> 19:31.542
Any suggestions?

19:31.625 --> 19:33.291
[gunfire]

19:33.375 --> 19:35.458
Got a bottle of soda pop?

19:37.041 --> 19:41.041
This is like taking candy
from a sitting rubber duck off a log.

19:42.250 --> 19:46.875
Oh, Auto. I think you've been
working too hard.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.792
-Time to cool off.
-No!

19:56.792 --> 19:58.959
I'll bury you!

19:59.959 --> 20:03.834
Quiet, professor.
Let a real pilot handle this.

20:08.291 --> 20:12.208
Oh, that ugly pilot machine
looks like Baloo.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.625
Funny, it also flies like Baloo.

20:20.709 --> 20:22.333
Attack!

20:25.625 --> 20:30.583
[grunting] Shoot the bear,
not your own disgusting selves.

20:30.834 --> 20:36.208
My wonderfully brilliant mind tells me
it may be time for a strategic withdrawal.

20:36.291 --> 20:39.709
-Say what?
-Runaway!

20:43.458 --> 20:45.458
That was more than adequate.

20:45.542 --> 20:49.792
Thanks, Khanny. You ought to see me
when I'm really adequate.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.041
Yes, I can imagine.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.166
[electricity buzzing]

20:53.250 --> 20:55.208
If you'll excuse me a moment.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.792
You've disappointed me, professor.

20:57.875 --> 21:02.041
Worse, you have deceived me.
But I have a solution.

21:02.125 --> 21:06.041
-You... you do?
-You give me back all my money,

21:06.125 --> 21:09.542
and I'll give you back
all your cretinous contraptions.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.083
Tell me the truth now.

21:12.166 --> 21:16.291
-How does that sound to you?
-Sounds fair! Sounds fair!

21:16.375 --> 21:18.250
[man on radio]
<i>Dateline Cape Suzette.</i>

21:18.333 --> 21:22.166
<i>Khan Industries today announced</i>
<i>that it has junked all its robots.</i>

21:22.250 --> 21:24.375
<i>Pilots are to report back to work.</i>

21:24.458 --> 21:27.458
[all]
Yeah!

21:28.166 --> 21:31.333
But first, Baloo, would you do the honors?

21:31.709 --> 21:33.750
Don't mind if I do.

21:34.917 --> 21:36.667
[all cheering]

21:40.709 --> 21:45.125
I just remembered... Well, you never said
where Professor Tork ended up.

21:45.208 --> 21:47.583
Going back to the drawing board, I guess.

21:47.834 --> 21:50.792
[bell tolling]

21:52.458 --> 21:54.917
[wheels screeching]

21:55.000 --> 21:58.917
[Tork] Yes, ladies,
it's the amazing new Mechani-mate.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.583
The answer to your every household need.

22:01.667 --> 22:05.917
They'll sweep, they'll clean,
thaw your oven.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.542
