WEBVTT

00:50.092 --> 00:51.135
Shh!

01:20.998 --> 01:23.334
Groovy! Fred and Daphne.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.800
And now for the next original dance on
the <i>Johnny Sands Dance</i> Game <i>Show...</i>

01:30.967 --> 01:34.011
here's Shaggy and Scooby-Doo
and their "Toffee Twist."

01:43.354 --> 01:47.650
Well, it is original, and they
might just win the dance contest.

01:47.817 --> 01:50.695
- Except for one thing, Mr. Stevens.
- What's that?

01:50.861 --> 01:53.197
They might eat their way
out of the contest.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.869
- Like, I thought it was an eating contest.
- Me too.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.498
Hey! What was that?

02:02.665 --> 02:05.209
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

02:05.376 --> 02:06.627
Right here.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.550
Let me out of here! Oh!

02:14.343 --> 02:16.554
- What happened?
- Johnny's famous for his...

02:16.721 --> 02:19.890
publicity stunts,
but this tops everything.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.893
Sure, but what was that big,
shapeless thing?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.104
I don't know, but it was awful.

02:25.271 --> 02:27.398
Help! In here!

02:27.565 --> 02:28.899
Help!

02:29.108 --> 02:32.069
It's coming from that way.
Come on.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.239
Hey, how about us?

02:35.948 --> 02:39.702
Come on, Scoob. Keep hopping
and eating. It's the only way out of this.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.412
Yeah.

02:41.704 --> 02:44.290
Wow! What a mess.

02:46.584 --> 02:49.920
Come on, Johnny.
The publicity stunt's over.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.922
But it wasn't a publicity stunt.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.424
Like, what's happening?

02:53.591 --> 02:56.927
The lights went out, and all
I can remember is the Wax Phantom.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.013
- Wax Phantom?
- Yes.

02:59.180 --> 03:03.517
The station's been receiving threatening
notes signed "the Wax Phantom."

03:03.684 --> 03:06.520
Several years ago, the TV station
had a wax-figure maker...

03:06.687 --> 03:08.189
named Grisby on a Show...

03:08.356 --> 03:10.775
- and then canceled him.
- I remember.

03:10.941 --> 03:15.029
Anyway, this eccentric old character
swore revenge.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.948
- Like what?
- He promised to bring to life...

03:18.115 --> 03:20.701
one of his wax creations
from the wax museum.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.662
Like... Like that big wax creep?

03:23.829 --> 03:27.124
Yes. The Wax Phantom.
To destroy us all.

03:27.291 --> 03:28.834
Well, you're okay.

03:29.001 --> 03:32.129
Yeah. But what happened
to Mr. Stevens, the station manager?

03:32.338 --> 03:35.299
That's right. He just vanished.

03:35.674 --> 03:39.053
The safe was robbed. Mr. Stevens
could've been taken hostage.

03:39.220 --> 03:44.600
Yes, except for one thing. How could
that 9-foot wax guy just vanish?

03:44.767 --> 03:46.185
And with a hostage?

03:46.352 --> 03:49.146
Unless the curse
of the Wax Phantom is true.

03:49.313 --> 03:50.815
The Wax Phantom?

03:52.983 --> 03:55.736
Look! Wax footprints.

03:55.903 --> 03:59.281
- And look where they go.
- That's a good trick.

03:59.448 --> 04:03.327
The tracks stop at the window,
and we're 10 stories up.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.913
- Maybe we should call the police.
- No.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.750
The station's in financial trouble.
This kind of publicity could close it.

04:09.959 --> 04:13.838
Well, it looks like we have
another mystery on our hands.

04:14.130 --> 04:18.384
And, like, judging from the size of those
footprints, a really big mystery.

04:18.551 --> 04:20.010
Let's get started.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.932
Now, here's my plan. Daph and I
will check out the wax museum.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.352
And, Velma, you and Shaggy
and Scooby go question Grisby.

04:28.519 --> 04:31.647
- Sands gave you his address.
- How about, like, some other time?

04:32.022 --> 04:35.651
- How about, like, when?
- How about, like, Christmas?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.029
Okay, then. Merry Christmas!

04:48.456 --> 04:50.374
Nobody's home. Let's go.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.669
Come on, you guys.
Don't be so chicken.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.589
Ghosts!

05:02.094 --> 05:03.971
Look up there.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.933
Well, like, who's chicken?

05:10.644 --> 05:15.524
Who? Like, we still are. That's who.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.028
- Zoinks!
- Enter.

05:19.195 --> 05:25.242
- Yes, sir.
- Shh. There's a cemetery nearby.

05:28.621 --> 05:29.914
What a place to live.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.126
Nice place you have here,
Mr. Grisby.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.505
- Like, nice and scary.
- Yeah. Scary.

05:37.713 --> 05:42.051
- We want to ask you what happened at...
- The TV station tonight?

05:42.343 --> 05:44.553
Yes, but how did you know?

05:44.720 --> 05:48.432
I have my ways, like my crystal ball.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.394
I wonder what's cooking.

05:52.561 --> 05:53.938
Mmm.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.078
Looks like Mom's stew.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.579
Huh?

06:12.623 --> 06:16.168
I've heard of bubble gum,
but bubble-ghost stew? Ridiculous.

06:16.335 --> 06:19.255
Yeah. Ridiculous.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.551
You saw the Wax Phantom, eh?

06:23.717 --> 06:25.386
Unfortunately, yes.

06:27.596 --> 06:33.018
Then my black magic is working
to exact the revenge I promised.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.941
- Zoinks! Yikes!
- Ah!

06:39.191 --> 06:43.320
Quick! We've got to hurry
to the museum and warn the others.

06:50.995 --> 06:56.417
So they didn't believe in the foolish
old wax-maker's black magic, eh...

06:56.584 --> 06:58.752
Wax Phantom?

07:09.805 --> 07:12.975
It looks closed for the night,
but come on.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.519
Uh-oh.

07:15.686 --> 07:19.523
- Somebody forgot to lock the door.
- Hey, they did!

07:19.690 --> 07:22.526
Well, let's go in.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.076
What clicked?

07:31.702 --> 07:32.828
Yow!

07:36.915 --> 07:38.584
It almost had me!

07:38.751 --> 07:43.088
Relax! It's just a wax figure.
There's nothing for real.

07:46.759 --> 07:50.721
- That's for real.
- You know it!

07:57.019 --> 07:59.313
I don't get it.
The door is locked.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.900
Yeah, and the Mystery Machine is here.
Let's split up.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.985
No. Our friends need us.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.988
We'll have to boost Scooby
through a window to let us in.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.157
Uh-uh. Not me.

08:10.324 --> 08:13.118
Nothing could get him into that place.

08:13.285 --> 08:15.079
Not even a Scooby Snack?

08:15.245 --> 08:18.123
Well, almost nothing.
Let's find a window, Scoob.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.000
Scooby-Doo!

08:20.167 --> 08:22.294
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.675
- Let's go find the window, Scoob.
- Right.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.470
Hold on, Velma.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.183
Like, Shh!

08:36.350 --> 08:37.643
Where are we?

08:37.810 --> 08:41.563
We'll soon find out.
I'll turn on the lights.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.399
Zoinks!

08:46.777 --> 08:50.656
Cool it, you two.
This is just a wax-monster display.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.410
Like, phooey.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.412
Now for that vampire.

08:59.248 --> 09:01.750
Okay, Scoob, let's get with it.

09:01.917 --> 09:03.460
- Zoinks!
- Yikes!

09:06.797 --> 09:10.926
It's okay, guys.
That's just part of the act too.

09:13.679 --> 09:15.431
Oh, no!

09:16.098 --> 09:19.601
Like, it's just part of the act, Velma.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.606
Maybe, but that isn't.

09:31.029 --> 09:34.908
- Sure glad to run into you, Velma.
- Where's Shag and Scoob?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.286
They were right over-

09:44.168 --> 09:46.086
Look! It's opening!

09:46.378 --> 09:47.504
Like:

09:50.340 --> 09:53.051
Shaggy! What are you doing in there?

09:53.218 --> 09:56.013
Like, who knows?
We just dropped in to see my mummy.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.681
Yeah. Mummy.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.643
- Hey, what's that on the floor?
- Huh?

10:02.811 --> 10:07.357
It's some kind of an airline ticket.
It is an airline ticket.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.902
To South America!

10:10.068 --> 10:12.529
Somebody must have
accidentally dropped it.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.532
Like, somebody or something.

10:15.699 --> 10:18.368
Anyway, it's real, and it's a clue.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.372
And there might be more clues around.
Let's go.

10:25.918 --> 10:30.088
- Look! The Wax Phantom display.
- But no Wax Phantom!

10:30.255 --> 10:34.176
- That's because he's looking for us.
- Well, then let's us look for him.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.721
Like, there's something
I'd rather look for. You all go on.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.308
Food.

10:42.059 --> 10:45.229
Now, if the Wax Phantom
doesn't drop in on us-

10:48.315 --> 10:50.901
It looks like we did the dropping in.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.862
And from the looks of this place,
there's no way out.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.783
Then it's got us.
We're prisoners of the Wax Phantom.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.704
- Hey, Scoob, pass the yummy fruit.
- Okay.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.666
Thanks.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.960
Thanks.

11:12.214 --> 11:15.050
Wax! Like, everything here is wax!

11:15.217 --> 11:17.886
Yes, foolish intruders.

11:18.053 --> 11:21.765
- What?
- You, too, shall soon become members...

11:21.932 --> 11:25.519
- of my wax family.
- Like, we're sorry, Mr. Phantom.

11:25.686 --> 11:29.314
- But here, have some fruit.
- Yeah, here.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.204
Don't ask me how we got on the ceiling,
but hang on, Scoob.

11:44.371 --> 11:47.332
- Oh, boy!
- When I say let go, let loose...

11:47.499 --> 11:51.253
and we'll drop down on the sofa.
Go!

11:51.587 --> 11:55.090
Like, this place is haunted.
We let go, but we didn't fall.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.844
It'II get us. Come on!

12:06.602 --> 12:09.605
Like, that worked up an appetite.
Hold out your paw.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.940
Yeah. Hey!

12:12.316 --> 12:15.444
Let's get out of here, fast!

12:18.238 --> 12:20.449
Like, we're safe now.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.827
- I think.
- Oh, no!

12:25.787 --> 12:27.873
Oh, yes!

12:28.081 --> 12:29.708
Oh!

12:36.965 --> 12:40.218
No windows or doors.
We're trapped for sure.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.304
Hey! A secret panel!

12:43.055 --> 12:44.431
What did you find?

12:44.598 --> 12:48.936
- Money, and a lot of it.
- That came from that TV station's safe.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.938
I'd say it's a valuable clue.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.149
Sure, but we can't get out of here.

12:54.316 --> 12:58.654
That old phantom, he makes me so mad!

12:59.655 --> 13:01.615
Velma, you did it again!

13:01.782 --> 13:05.702
- What, lose my temper?
- Yes, and found a way out.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.163
You stepped on a secret-door lever.

13:08.330 --> 13:12.167
- I did?
- Yeah. How about that? Let's go.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.754
We better search
for Shaggy and Scooby.

13:15.921 --> 13:18.298
- But where?
- Zoinks!

13:18.465 --> 13:21.510
Offhand, I'd say over there
at that ventilator.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.178
Come on. Let's take a peek.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.517
It's Shaggy and Scooby
and the Wax Phantom!

13:28.976 --> 13:32.437
I know this sounds silly,
but what are we doing in the waxworks?

13:32.604 --> 13:35.482
You will soon become wax dummies.

13:35.649 --> 13:38.235
But we're already dummies,
right, Scoob?

13:38.694 --> 13:40.529
Right.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.864
See? We're dummies.

13:44.825 --> 13:48.662
Not the old ride-on-the-conveyor-belt-
into-the-wax routine.

13:48.829 --> 13:49.955
Oh, no.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.206
Uh-huh.

13:51.581 --> 13:56.044
Like, that went out with
the silent movies, phantom, old pal.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.803
- Do something.
- Do something? Okay.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.474
Oh, those poor boys.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.476
Daphne, look out!

14:13.061 --> 14:16.523
Hey! That lever stopped
the conveyor belt.

14:16.690 --> 14:21.361
No, it didn't. She reversed it.
Come on. We've got to help them!

14:21.862 --> 14:23.321
What happened?

14:26.742 --> 14:30.287
- It was nice of phanty to break our fall.
- Yeah.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.043
Like, I was afraid he'd say that.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.880
Now where did they go?

14:40.047 --> 14:42.674
That way. The phantom is after them.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.385
Then we better go after the phantom.
Come on!

16:37.873 --> 16:41.168
Boy, we're safe now.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.464
Boy, are we glad to see you guys!

16:46.631 --> 16:48.175
How did you ever escape?

16:48.383 --> 16:52.929
Like, you might say we just let
the Wax Phantom use his head.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.813
What do we do about the phantom?

17:01.980 --> 17:04.733
We trap him by fighting wax with wax.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.568
Like, you've got to be kidding.

17:06.735 --> 17:10.530
No, and it should be easy.
We'll trap him in his own waxworks.

17:10.697 --> 17:13.742
Now, here's my plan.
Look down there.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.913
Velma, you'll hide on the top
of those crates to serve as a lookout.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.081
Daphne will stay behind the door.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.584
When the phantom comes in,
she'll slam it...

17:22.751 --> 17:25.420
and lock old waxy inside
so he can't escape.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.423
I'll be over there to operate
the wax-shower sprayer.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.593
When the phantom steps in the shower,
he's wax!

17:31.760 --> 17:34.429
Like, why should the phantom
go to the shower?

17:34.596 --> 17:37.098
Simple. You and Scoob
will lure him there.

17:38.225 --> 17:43.355
- Us?
- Us? Freddy, the plan is fantastic, but-

17:43.521 --> 17:45.899
- But what?
- We won't do it, right, Scoob?

17:46.066 --> 17:47.442
Right.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.945
- Have you got another plan?
- Like, yeah!

17:50.111 --> 17:52.197
Look out there and tell me
what you see.

17:52.364 --> 17:53.949
The waxworks.

17:57.077 --> 18:00.038
- They're gone!
- Of all the nerve!

18:00.205 --> 18:05.085
I have to laugh at myself.
Those two chickens tricked us.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.178
- What was that?
- The phantom, that's what.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.140
You're right.
It is the Wax Phantom. Run!

18:19.307 --> 18:21.142
I am!

18:27.482 --> 18:29.317
I hope this will hold him.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.447
Bombs away!

18:37.158 --> 18:39.828
- Bull's-eye!
- Get him over here, Shaggy!

18:39.995 --> 18:42.998
As soon as he uncrates himself, Freddy.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.004
He's coming.

18:51.423 --> 18:53.717
I hope we're too fast for old waxy.

18:57.345 --> 19:01.182
- We must be way ahead of the phantom.
- Oh, yeah?

19:06.396 --> 19:07.939
Me and my big mouth.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.651
Lead him through the showers
for his wax job, Shaggy!

19:12.777 --> 19:14.696
Hey!

19:17.407 --> 19:20.910
Shag! Scoob!
You weren't supposed to be in on this!

19:25.957 --> 19:29.919
Well, it looks like you captured
the Wax Phantom, but who's who?

19:30.086 --> 19:32.964
The two small ones
are Shaggy and Scooby.

19:33.131 --> 19:37.302
And the big one's the phantom,
whom they so artistically captured.

19:37.469 --> 19:41.389
- In his own wax.
- And now for the unwaxing.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.393
Oh! Oh!

19:49.731 --> 19:52.400
- Okay, Scoob?
- You got to be kidding.

19:52.859 --> 19:57.197
Now, Mr. Wax Phantom,
time to find out who you really are.

19:59.199 --> 20:02.327
Hey! You're chipping him down
to regular size.

20:04.579 --> 20:08.375
Mr. Roger Stevens,
the TV station manager!

20:08.541 --> 20:11.836
And I wish you'd have minded
your own business.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.172
Well, in this case,
it's police business.

20:14.339 --> 20:17.258
We thought old waxy
was really a ghost.

20:17.425 --> 20:19.761
Or at least old Grisby was behind it.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.348
No, Shaggy. That's just what Stevens
wants us to think...

20:23.515 --> 20:27.685
while he escapes to South America
with all the money he embezzled.

20:27.936 --> 20:32.857
Sure. Stevens knew of old Grisby's
threat to bring the Wax Phantom to life.

20:33.316 --> 20:37.445
So he used the phantom disguise. Then
Grisby would be blamed for everything.

20:37.612 --> 20:42.283
Including Stevens' disappearance.
I'll take him now, kids. Thanks.

20:45.036 --> 20:48.081
- Aren't our wax statues the greatest?
- Yeah.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.501
What are you fellas going to do
with those wax dummies?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.045
Like, simple.
Next time we have a mystery...

20:54.212 --> 20:56.089
those dummies can go
instead of us.

20:56.256 --> 21:00.885
There's only one problem: How to tell
one pair of dummies from the other.

21:03.304 --> 21:06.141
Very funny. Very funny.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.977
Yeah. Very funny.

21:56.524 --> 21:57.567
Shh!
