00:09.217 --> 00:10.593
Okay, we fixed
most of the camp,

00:10.969 --> 00:13.346
but we still have
leaky toilets,
cracked canoes,

00:13.346 --> 00:15.473
and the flagpole
that's barely held together
with duct tape.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.685
There's not just tape
holding the pole together.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.894
There's chewing gum
on there, too.

00:22.021 --> 00:25.024
Excuse me,
can you direct me
to the camp owners?

00:25.024 --> 00:28.570
That's us! Are you the one
we hired to scrape the dead
seagulls off the dock?

00:29.988 --> 00:33.825
Oh, yeah, it's that way.
They can really stick,
so put your elbow into it.

00:34.993 --> 00:39.289
I am Inspector Dinsmore,
with the Department of
Camp Services.

00:39.664 --> 00:44.127
Nowhere on this badge
does it say anything
about scraping bird goo.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.422
Wait, we didn't hear anything
about an inspection!

00:47.672 --> 00:51.342
It's a surprise inspection.
(CHUCKLES) Surprise!

00:53.470 --> 00:58.016
But we are not ready!
Could you come back
in maybe, one month?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.020
Don't worry,
I got this.

01:02.604 --> 01:05.940
Ma'am, I'm sure
there's something
we can work out.

01:06.357 --> 01:09.402
Would this help us
pass the inspection?

01:10.737 --> 01:11.738
Is that a bribe?

01:11.988 --> 01:14.074
Don't ask me.
Ask Benjamin Franklin.

Maybe instead
of summer camp, you should
be in summer school.

01:24.375 --> 01:27.337

And, voila!

02:59.762 --> 03:00.763
Meh.

03:04.559 --> 03:07.520
This is way too steep.
Someone could slide
right down it!

We know we have
a few kinks to iron out,

03:49.187 --> 03:51.481

Never fake sickness

05:36.419 --> 05:38.755
Also, you spelled
nurse with a "Z."

05:42.175 --> 05:43.926
This place is a mess.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.229
Inspector Dinsmore,
we are so sorry you fell,

06:36.229 --> 06:39.941
but it's not like we can check
all the wood in all the camp
to see if it's rotted out.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.819
No, that would be
a lot of trouble.
(SHOUTING) Of course, you can!

06:44.445 --> 06:47.448
Ugh, this is the same
awful place it's been
since I was a kid!

06:47.949 --> 06:49.242
You were
an inspector
as a kid?

06:50.993 --> 06:54.247
No, I was
a camper here!
I hated it.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.501
If I find one more thing
wrong, I'm going to shut
this dump down!

06:58.501 --> 06:59.502
Please don't do that!

07:00.461 --> 07:02.171
Look, we know this camp
isn't perfect.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.591
But so what
if the baseball field
is on a landfill,

07:05.591 --> 07:08.219
and a pack of porcupines
just moved into
the boat house, and...

07:08.803 --> 07:09.804
Stop helping!

07:11.931 --> 07:15.268
What we lack in fire
extinguishers, we make up
for in happy campers.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.019
Exactly.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.729
In fact, tonight
is our traditional

"Camp Kikiwaka

07:21.190 --> 07:24.068

and see how much fun
our campers have.

Okay, fine. But only because
I want to miss the traffic
back to Moose Rump.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.201
It's gonna be
antler-to-antler.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.666
Okay, Finn, we've got
some tips on how to stay

07:38.666 --> 07:41.419
calm and confident
in front of a crowd.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.421
What are these for?

07:44.297 --> 07:45.840
They're your "audience."

07:47.383 --> 07:48.593
They won't stop
staring at me!

07:50.553 --> 07:53.556
That's because
they're cardboard cutouts.
They can't blink.

07:55.516 --> 07:58.644
Don't worry about that one.
He's a real sourpuss.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.856
And... Go!

08:07.487 --> 08:08.988
I think he's stuck.

08:10.948 --> 08:12.074
Or dead.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.703
Let's try
something else.

08:16.454 --> 08:21.250
Picture the whole audience
as something that makes you
laugh... Like clowns!

08:21.792 --> 08:22.793

08:48.194 --> 08:49.195
Well, I offered.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.657
Look, this party
is really important.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.575
We need to impress
Inspector Dinsmore.

08:54.575 --> 08:57.995
So, please make yourself
useful and get some frosting
from the pantry.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.456
But that's like
four feet away!

09:02.542 --> 09:03.543

09:08.506 --> 09:10.675
ZURI: Why are all these
chocolate chips
on the floor?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.845
Those are not chocolate chips!
Do not mention them
to Inspector Dinsmore.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.932
I found this
way in the back.

09:19.308 --> 09:21.143
Whoa. This is
really expired.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.145
No kidding.

09:23.145 --> 09:26.524
It says "number one
frosting brand
in all 48 states."

09:28.609 --> 09:32.113
Great, how am I going to find
time to go into town
and get more frosting?

09:32.572 --> 09:35.533
I guess I could hike
to the market, grab the icing,
and come back.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.243
That's perfect!
You would do that?

09:37.618 --> 09:39.829
I said I could.
Not that I would.

09:42.456 --> 09:45.001
Wow! That Dinsmore
really hates this place.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.295
That's why
she's gotta have
fun at the party,

09:47.295 --> 09:48.879
so she can see
how great Camp Kikiwaka is.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.216
Got it. Limbo stick.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.344
Or not.

09:56.804 --> 09:58.514
Okay, I'm going
to finish the party prep.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.058
Make sure Dinsmore
doesn't see anything else
that will get us in trouble.

10:01.892 --> 10:05.062
Right. I'll keep her away
from those exposed wires
by the water fountain.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.235
Wow, that was close.
I know.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.863
A few inches lower
and our problem
would've been solved.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.658
You have a dark side.
I like that.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
Oh, seriously?
The cake's
not ready yet?

10:25.541 --> 10:30.588
Well, I guess it's up to me
to take this dessert from
drab to fab. Cake-over!

10:36.844 --> 10:38.888
Zuri, did you
get the frosting?

10:40.056 --> 10:43.351
Aw, she not only got it,
she also applied it!

10:43.851 --> 10:45.227
And it is truly fab!

10:47.229 --> 10:48.272
Wow.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.524
Gladys replenished
the decorations

10:50.524 --> 10:52.693
even less frequently
than the toilet paper.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.617
"Congratulations,
President Lincoln"

11:03.829 --> 11:05.414
Same old mess hall.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.751
I see the floorboards
are still stained
with the tears

11:08.751 --> 11:11.420
of all the miserable campers
who have passed through here.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.465
Who hurt you?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.596
Inspector Dinsmore, I'm sorry
you hated camp back then,
but it's a great place now,

11:20.596 --> 11:22.640
and tonight you'll see
a room packed
with happy campers.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.643
Although not so many
that it would violate
the fire code!

11:27.269 --> 11:28.270
We'll see.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.316
One more slip-up,
and I'll shut this camp down
faster than you can say,

But I can't even
say that slow.

11:43.702 --> 11:44.829
Sorry for being late.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.581
The store clerk
had the gall to say

11:47.581 --> 11:49.875
Reba isn't the best
female country star
in the world.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.544
I set him straight.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.965
You know, actually, some say
Shania Twain gives her a run
for her money.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.384
What did you say?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.678
Nothing.
I said nothing.

12:02.346 --> 12:03.347
Wait, what is that?

12:03.722 --> 12:05.224
I got you
your frosting.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.644
See, I can be
responsible and mature.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.229
So... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

12:12.940 --> 12:15.234
But you already
frosted the cake.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.320
Emma and Lou are handing
it out now for people to eat
after the speeches.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.531
Uh, I didn't
frost the cake.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.909
Well, if you did not,
then who did?
It was me.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.454
That cake
got frosted, son!

12:28.330 --> 12:30.666
Emma, this frosting
is expired!

12:30.666 --> 12:33.002
Like, middle-of-
last-century expired.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.880
Oh, so that's
why it says,

12:35.880 --> 12:38.632
"Beat those
Great Depression blues
with our delicious frosting!"

12:39.550 --> 12:42.761
You handed out
expired toxic cake
to everyone!

12:42.761 --> 12:45.639
We have to get it back
before anyone eats it
and gets sick!

12:45.931 --> 12:47.683
Oh, no!

12:47.683 --> 12:49.685
If Dinsmore finds out,
she'll shut us down
faster than I can say,

how are you doing?

Awful!

13:04.950 --> 13:07.661
I'm having
trouble breathing,
I'm dizzy,

13:07.912 --> 13:11.248
and I feel like
I'm going to barf up
all my vital organs.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.669
Now you know
how I feel sharing
a bathroom with you.

13:17.254 --> 13:20.049
Sorry, we're dealing
with your issues right now.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.848
I'm going to look like
an idiot up there.
It's going to be a disaster!

13:31.352 --> 13:35.022
Finn, you need to relax.
You're thinking about it
too much.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.192
Wow, I bet no one has ever
accused you of that before.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.039
Thanks for trying, guys.
But it's no use.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.504
Okay, we have to do
something drastic
to help Finn.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.007
Gotcha. I'll put
itching powder
in the campers' clothes,

14:02.007 --> 14:03.425
so they can't do
their speeches.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.636
What? No, that's insane.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.722
Have you actually
done that before?

14:09.723 --> 14:11.892
Hey, all's fair
in love and pageants.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.857
And here you go.
ZURI: This should
be the last of it.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.028
Oh, no! There's still
one piece missing!

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
Okay, nobody panic!

14:28.200 --> 14:30.619
Lou, you start the speeches,
and see if you can spot

14:30.619 --> 14:31.996
the missing piece
of cake from the stage.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.205
We'll keep looking
from the audience.

14:34.874 --> 14:38.919
Man, I never thought
I'd hate cake so much,
but here we are.

14:39.879 --> 14:45.718
Good evening, and welcome
to the "Camp Kikiwaka Kick Off
the Summer Fun Party!"

14:46.385 --> 14:47.511
(CAMPERS CHEERING)

14:49.722 --> 14:51.765
Are you guys ready
to have some fun?

14:51.765 --> 14:52.892
No!

14:53.726 --> 14:56.186
Okay, we'll try
to power through anyway.

14:58.856 --> 15:02.484
Uh, back on the farm,
there's a saying that goes,

15:02.818 --> 15:05.237
"a happy animal
makes for good eatin'."

15:05.237 --> 15:07.239
Just ask my good friend
Peggy the Pig.

15:08.198 --> 15:11.744
Well, you can't,
because I ate her.
But boy, was she delicious.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.831
Wow, even though the camp
might get shut down,

15:15.831 --> 15:18.125
Lou is really
keeping it together
under all the pressure.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.962
Yeah, talking about eating
her close friends must have
a calming effect on her.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.551
In the same way,
a happy camp makes
for happy campers.

15:27.801 --> 15:30.846
So when you hear these kids
give their speeches,
you'll see how

15:31.430 --> 15:33.432
happy they really are.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.268
Ooh, well played.

15:44.109 --> 15:47.863
Um, anyway,
these kids really
take the cake.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.950
The cake
in the front row.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.410
Look!
(RAVI GASPS)

15:53.953 --> 15:56.038
That kid must have
hidden it when he saw us
taking the cake back!

15:56.288 --> 15:58.707
Those kids
from Fox Cabin
are so sly.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.337
I can't wait to hear
what all these campers
love about camp.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.756
Coming up first
is my fabulous
cousin Finn!

16:06.674 --> 16:08.884
The only thing
coming up
is my lunch!

16:10.135 --> 16:11.512
Hey, Lou!
I want to go first!

16:13.389 --> 16:16.225
Ah, okay, well then I guess
we'll start with my fabulous
non-cousin, Matteo.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.190
What I love most
about Camp Kikiwaka

16:23.190 --> 16:25.985
is studying the dinosaurs
that once roamed here.

16:26.527 --> 16:31.240
And now, I'll name my top
57 of them
in alphabetical order.

16:33.283 --> 16:37.788
Allosaurus, Brontosaurus,
Dilophosaurus...

16:40.332 --> 16:41.875
We have
to do something!

16:41.875 --> 16:44.545
One of us has to
grab that cake
without Dinsmore noticing.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.297
I've never gone anywhere
without being noticed.
But I'll try.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.136
No, I shall do it.
No woman has
ever noticed me.

16:52.886 --> 16:53.929
You said it, brother.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.061
Ooh, thank you.

17:07.359 --> 17:08.944
I think our problem
just got worse.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.696
Guess we'll go to plan B.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.490
Hope the cake takes her
out before she can
close down the camp.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.119
Podokesaurus,
Pterosaurus.

17:17.745 --> 17:20.247
Don't worry, I haven't
skipped to the "T's."

17:20.706 --> 17:21.874
That was a silent "P."

17:24.043 --> 17:26.837
Quaesitosaurus,
Quilmesaurus...

17:27.504 --> 17:28.964
Hey, Jurassic jerk!

17:30.883 --> 17:34.219
If you'd been around
back then, the dinosaurs
would've died from boredom!

17:35.679 --> 17:38.390
Excuse me,
I'm trying to give
a speech here!

17:38.891 --> 17:41.560
I know. And I wish
you were extinct!

17:42.478 --> 17:44.938
Destiny, why are you
being so mean to him?

17:45.522 --> 17:49.943
We're staging a fake fight,
so Lou will get mad at us,
and cancel the speeches.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.945
That way, you won't
have to give yours.

17:52.905 --> 17:55.199
I can't believe you two
would do that just for me.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.993
Of course.
Anything for
a friend.

17:59.119 --> 18:01.622
Get off the stage,
nerd-osaurus!

18:02.790 --> 18:05.167
Make me,
Little Miss
Bleach Brain!

18:09.922 --> 18:12.341
Get ready for a ride
on the pain train!

18:13.008 --> 18:14.843
More like the lame train!

18:18.055 --> 18:19.431
Break it up!

18:20.682 --> 18:22.184
You guys are
ruining everything!

18:22.518 --> 18:24.770
I didn't ruin it!
Destiny ruined it!

18:25.312 --> 18:28.023
Either way,
it's clearly ruined!

18:28.023 --> 18:32.069
So you should probably just
cancel this whole thing before
anyone else has to speak!

18:33.654 --> 18:35.948
Well, I might as well
enjoy something tonight.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.996
No!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.633
Whoopsies!

18:55.634 --> 18:57.302
That is enough!

18:57.636 --> 18:59.555
I'm shutting this camp down!

18:59.888 --> 19:00.973
Huh?
What?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.766
Why?
Inspector Dinsmore,
please don't!

19:02.766 --> 19:03.892
Just give us
one more chance!

19:04.143 --> 19:06.812
No. Nothing good
has ever come
from this camp.

19:07.104 --> 19:09.982
And nothing
ever will.
Good day!

19:13.110 --> 19:15.320
Please, you can't
close down the camp!

19:15.696 --> 19:19.074
Um, I just did.
That's why I said,
"good day."

19:21.034 --> 19:26.915
But I love Camp Kikiwaka.
It's an amazing place,
with amazing people.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.458
What?

19:28.834 --> 19:30.586
Those two just
got into a huge fight!

19:31.003 --> 19:33.297
And that kid was just
droning on about dinosaurs!

19:35.424 --> 19:36.675
Great party, guys!

19:38.468 --> 19:40.929
Destiny and Matteo
were just pretending
to fight,

19:41.680 --> 19:43.432
so they could get
the speeches canceled,

19:43.807 --> 19:47.728
because I have stage fright.
Only true friends
would do that.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.356
You two faked that
whole fight just
to help him out?

19:51.899 --> 19:56.069
It wasn't all fake.
I think I pulled a tricep
raising my fists.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.741
See, I was too afraid
to get up there and speak.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.285
But if I had,
I would've
talked about

20:03.285 --> 20:05.913
how much I love this place
and hanging out
with my new friends.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.999
So, please, please
don't close down the camp.

20:11.043 --> 20:16.048
You know, I had
an awful time when
I was a camper here.

20:17.966 --> 20:20.886
But, I never made friends
like the ones you've made.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.848
I've been told
I can be a bit of
a fart nugget.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.851
ALL: No.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.981
It's true. I was voted
"Most Annoying Camper."

20:34.191 --> 20:36.568
The plaque was just
my picture on
a dart board.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.948
Well, it's never too late
to make friends at camp.

20:41.198 --> 20:44.284
Yeah, you should stick around
and hang out around
the campfire with us.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.204
Actually, that sounds
kind of nice.

20:47.829 --> 20:51.208
So, what do you say,
Inspector Dinsmore? Shall
we save you a marshmallow?

20:53.085 --> 20:56.672
Okay... And I'll give you
one month to get this
place up to code.

20:57.172 --> 21:01.593
But that means
no dead fowl on the dock,
no recycling food,

21:01.969 --> 21:06.723
and your smoke detectors
can't just be old cans of tuna
glued to the ceiling.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.060
You noticed that?

21:11.520 --> 21:14.314
I saw a stray cat
hanging from one!

21:16.066 --> 21:19.653
So, if we fix
all those things,
does this mean...

21:22.114 --> 21:23.573
Yes, the camp
stays open!

21:23.573 --> 21:26.159
(CAMPERS CHEERING)

21:28.495 --> 21:29.621
No, stop!

21:30.330 --> 21:31.790
What? It is
my cheat day.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.962
Way to go, Finn!
Nice speech!

21:37.296 --> 21:39.965
What? I didn't
make a speech.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.174
Of course you did!

21:41.174 --> 21:43.468
You spoke confidently
in front of a crowd,

21:43.885 --> 21:46.888
and not only did you
explain what you
love about camp,

21:47.222 --> 21:48.265
you saved the camp!

21:49.391 --> 21:52.019
Huh, guess my
stage fright is gone.

21:53.603 --> 21:56.648
That means now
I can tell everyone
about my scabs!

22:00.027 --> 22:02.446
I suffered a vicious
noogie for that?

22:06.616 --> 22:07.951
This is great!

22:08.285 --> 22:11.121
I'm finally getting the camp
experience I always wanted.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.914
Thank you so much
for including me.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.375
You're welcome.
Ooh, yours is
perfectly done.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.376
Hey!

22:17.336 --> 22:18.628
She really is
a fart nugget.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.133
Inspector Dinsmore,
thank you again for
not closing down the camp.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.553
Yeah. And we promise,
from now on, nothing else
will go wrong.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.062
Starting now.
