<i>I Citizen-General
Zakarian,</i>

00:30.415 --> 00:33.249
<i>address you as a leader
of the United Kingdom</i>

00:33.251 --> 00:35.220
<i>Liberation Army.</i>

00:37.154 --> 00:39.121
<i>This morning, martial law</i>

00:39.123 --> 00:41.524
<i>was imposed upon our nation</i>

00:41.526 --> 00:45.663
<i>after His Majesty's government
was declared unfit to rule.</i>

00:46.264 --> 00:49.564
<i>This after decades
of corruption, greed,</i>

00:49.566 --> 00:51.736
<i>xenophobia and racism.</i>

00:52.502 --> 00:54.536
<i>Yet your freedoms
diminish further.</i>

00:54.538 --> 00:57.405
<i>Oppressed by an unelected
military council</i>

00:57.407 --> 01:00.709
<i>interested only in power
and your subjugation.</i>

01:00.711 --> 01:04.712
<i>It is we, the UKLA,
who started this revolution.</i>

01:04.715 --> 01:06.848
<i>We, the UKLA militia,</i>

01:06.850 --> 01:09.452
<i>who fight for the freedom
of the British people.</i>

01:09.454 --> 01:13.556
<i>We, the UKLA's blood,
that stains Britain's green</i>

01:13.558 --> 01:15.223
<i>and pleasant land.</i>

01:15.225 --> 01:17.693
<i>My fellow countrymen,
you have my word.</i>

01:17.695 --> 01:20.863
<i>This regime will burn
and from its ashes,</i>

01:20.865 --> 01:25.669
<i>our nation which once led
the world will rise again.</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:31.242
<i>This is a declaration of war.</i>

02:22.859 --> 02:24.595
Hey!

02:34.338 --> 02:35.639
Hey.

02:37.308 --> 02:39.210
Is anyone out there?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.554
Okay... Okay...

02:52.790 --> 02:54.559
<i>Hungry?</i>

02:56.928 --> 02:58.493
Sorry?

02:58.495 --> 03:00.665
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

03:07.772 --> 03:09.474
<i>Take it.</i>

03:11.675 --> 03:12.941
No.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.076
<i>The wrapper is sealed.</i>

03:14.078 --> 03:16.611
<i>Theres nothing in there
that shouldn't be.</i>

03:16.613 --> 03:18.379
Nuts?

03:18.381 --> 03:20.484
<i>Not a trace.</i>

03:49.579 --> 03:51.482
<i>Hows your head?</i>

03:53.517 --> 03:55.416
Who are you?

03:55.418 --> 03:57.385
<i>Has the bleeding stopped?</i>

03:57.387 --> 03:59.523
What have you done to me?

03:59.889 --> 04:04.262
<i>How about you stop answering
questions with questions?</i>

04:08.332 --> 04:10.401
<i>What do you remember?</i>

04:15.339 --> 04:17.341
I remember...

04:19.676 --> 04:23.012
I was...
hand-delivering a document.

04:23.014 --> 04:25.380
<i>What document?</i>

04:25.382 --> 04:28.320
I don't know,
I was just delivering it.

04:30.320 --> 04:32.356
<i>What's your name?</i>

04:33.623 --> 04:35.524
My name is Ruth.

04:35.526 --> 04:38.060
I'm an admin girl.
I handle deliveries.

04:38.062 --> 04:41.664
I transfer calls.
I make coffee runs.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.935
<i>So you know where you are?</i>

04:45.603 --> 04:48.273
Are we still in
the facility?

04:51.741 --> 04:53.842
I've only been here
two months!

04:53.844 --> 04:56.680
They keep us on
bi-monthly cycles.

05:01.485 --> 05:03.722
Are you still there?

05:07.957 --> 05:09.825
I don't know why you
put me in this thing

05:09.827 --> 05:12.897
or who told you
to put me in here...

05:22.606 --> 05:25.610
It's getting quite
hot in here.

05:34.985 --> 05:38.556
<i>Do you know what wet-bulb
temperature is?</i>

05:41.858 --> 05:45.663
<i>It's a combined measure of
dry temperature and humidity.</i>

05:47.832 --> 05:50.431
<i>The highest wet-bulb
temperature ever recorded</i>

05:50.433 --> 05:53.702
<i>was 33 degrees Celsius.</i>

05:53.704 --> 05:55.871
<i>That's what you're
feeling now.</i>

06:07.752 --> 06:09.988
What do you want?

06:11.688 --> 06:13.856
<i>Answers, Ruth.</i>

06:13.858 --> 06:17.493
<i>Answers about
what was going on here.</i>

06:26.437 --> 06:28.904
You okay?

06:28.906 --> 06:30.839
Do you need some help?

06:32.108 --> 06:35.544
<i>You're pretty calm and
collected for a mail girl.</i>

06:35.546 --> 06:38.479
I'm under no illusions.
You're the one in control here.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.914
<i>Hm.</i>

06:39.916 --> 06:42.387
<i>I need more convincing.</i>

06:44.154 --> 06:45.887
What do you mean?

07:01.839 --> 07:03.705
<i>You need to keep
moving, Ruth!</i>

07:03.707 --> 07:05.440
<i>It's so cold...</i>

07:05.442 --> 07:07.378
<i>Hypothermia!</i>

07:11.748 --> 07:14.582
<i>Take off those wet clothes!</i>

07:38.808 --> 07:41.745
<i>Your resolve is admirable...</i>

07:43.813 --> 07:46.614
<i>but the purpose
of this chamber</i>

07:46.616 --> 07:50.154
<i>is to break that resolve,
isn't it?</i>

08:03.700 --> 08:05.769
Can you dry these?

08:12.175 --> 08:14.008
Surely you could just
turn the temperature up

08:14.010 --> 08:17.212
in that bit of the room
or something?

08:17.214 --> 08:19.651
<i>I prefer you like this.</i>

08:20.116 --> 08:22.019
Pervert.

08:22.652 --> 08:24.652
<i>What have you got to hide?</i>

08:24.654 --> 08:26.190
Nothing!

08:27.190 --> 08:29.258
<i>I see that now.</i>

08:31.795 --> 08:33.760
<i>Drop them in there.</i>

08:33.763 --> 08:35.933
<i>I'll get them dried for you.</i>

08:45.175 --> 08:46.741
<i>That was quite a fight
you put up</i>

08:46.743 --> 08:49.214
<i>at minus 15 degrees Celsius.</i>

08:50.948 --> 08:53.952
I'd be dead now
if I hadn't started moving.

08:55.286 --> 08:57.488
What would you
have done then?

08:58.022 --> 08:59.891
<i>Moved on.</i>

09:00.791 --> 09:03.560
<i>You don't seem very useful.</i>

09:05.762 --> 09:09.166
<i>So what are those
2 tattoos on your wrist?</i>

09:11.935 --> 09:14.839
Just thought
they were pretty.

09:22.179 --> 09:24.649
How can you
see me so well?

09:44.801 --> 09:46.870
Are my clothes ready?

09:49.339 --> 09:51.776
I'm not hungry.

09:58.382 --> 10:00.685
<i>Take it, Ruth.</i>

10:01.685 --> 10:03.154
No.

10:04.387 --> 10:06.224
You animal.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.423
<i>Ruth.</i>

10:08.425 --> 10:12.964
<i>Take it or Ill make you wish
I'd let you freeze to death.</i>

10:24.273 --> 10:27.344
What have you done?!

10:29.146 --> 10:32.213
Why are you doing this?!

10:32.215 --> 10:34.683
<i>You see,</i>

10:34.685 --> 10:37.321
<i>I'm not afraid
to get primitive.</i>

10:39.323 --> 10:41.826
<i>Put it back now.</i>

10:46.664 --> 10:50.131
<i>What the fuck
was going on here?!</i>

10:50.133 --> 10:53.268
I told you,
I don't know.

10:53.270 --> 10:56.138
I'm just an admin girl!

10:56.140 --> 11:00.378
I don't know what goes on here,
it's miles above my pay grade!

11:03.213 --> 11:05.947
<i>If you know nothing,</i>

11:05.949 --> 11:08.085
<i>you're of no use to me.</i>

11:14.391 --> 11:15.760
Stop!

11:19.063 --> 11:20.361
Stop!
I'll talk!

11:20.363 --> 11:23.700
I'll talk!
I'll talk!

11:31.075 --> 11:32.977
<i>Talk then!</i>

11:36.180 --> 11:38.212
Let me see your face first.

11:38.214 --> 11:41.015
I want to see
who I'm talking to.

11:41.017 --> 11:43.018
<i>I didn't realize you were
calling the shots</i>

11:43.020 --> 11:45.319
<i>all of a sudden!</i>

11:45.321 --> 11:47.424
I'm not saying that...

11:50.160 --> 11:52.262
I'm not saying that.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.099
What's your objection anyway?

12:07.444 --> 12:09.845
Citizen-General Zakarian...

12:09.847 --> 12:12.116
Our reputation precedes us.

12:15.419 --> 12:17.722
What's it like out there?

12:18.488 --> 12:20.358
Carnage.

12:23.227 --> 12:25.863
Now give me the answers
you promised.

12:30.434 --> 12:32.199
Rumors were,
they were working on

12:32.201 --> 12:34.269
something big
for the war effort.

12:35.405 --> 12:37.872
What could they possibly...

12:37.874 --> 12:40.744
But nothing more ever
trickled down from the top.

12:41.911 --> 12:43.848
Well, no matter.

12:44.515 --> 12:47.182
They're going to need it.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.516
We have control of the North

12:48.518 --> 12:50.954
and most of the
southern counties.

12:55.993 --> 12:59.193
I've seen your speeches.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.263
Your calls to arms
claiming to fight

13:01.265 --> 13:03.832
for the good of the people.

13:03.834 --> 13:06.867
You've made this country
a war zone.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.472
You've killed innocent people
in bomb attacks!

13:10.474 --> 13:13.308
You're a butcher
who uses kamikaze tactics

13:13.310 --> 13:15.943
with no regard for the lives
of his own men!

13:15.945 --> 13:19.414
Such rhetoric they spin you.

13:19.416 --> 13:22.082
Why would so many join
such a man?

13:22.084 --> 13:25.486
We need to stand together,
not kill each other.

13:25.488 --> 13:28.122
Stand together?

13:28.124 --> 13:29.491
This country's rotting!

13:29.493 --> 13:32.427
Families are starving
because there are no jobs.

13:32.429 --> 13:34.596
Thousands have died
without healthcare!

13:34.598 --> 13:39.134
And having a foreign name
marks you for persecution.

13:39.136 --> 13:41.336
Intervention was imperative

13:41.338 --> 13:43.974
and we've done
what we needed to do.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.278
Because only the aggressive
are heard these days.

13:53.016 --> 13:56.120
Zakarian! Come back!
Zakarian!

14:24.647 --> 14:26.615
<i>We found your food
storage room.</i>

14:26.617 --> 14:28.352
<i>The size of it!</i>

14:29.485 --> 14:32.654
<i>Makes sense that you were
here for months at a time.</i>

14:35.124 --> 14:37.327
I have a question.

14:39.595 --> 14:42.432
All the people
that you've killed,

14:44.935 --> 14:48.205
how do you reconcile
taking their lives?

14:49.039 --> 14:51.275
In your own mind?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.147
<i>It hurts every time.</i>

14:58.047 --> 15:00.584
<i>To take the life
of a fellow countryman.</i>

15:02.419 --> 15:05.419
<i>A fellow human being.</i>

15:05.421 --> 15:08.023
<i>But they've made
themselves my enemy</i>

15:08.025 --> 15:10.962
<i>and that means,
it's me or them.</i>

15:12.461 --> 15:14.095
<i>I have enough belief
in my cause</i>

15:14.097 --> 15:16.567
<i>to justify my life
over theirs.</i>

15:19.536 --> 15:21.468
<i>You agree with me!</i>

15:21.470 --> 15:23.106
No. No.

15:24.206 --> 15:26.443
Just light on sleep.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.322
Where are you from?

15:40.324 --> 15:42.957
I'm British.
Same as you.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.358
You know what I mean.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.330
Zakarian.
What is that?

15:48.065 --> 15:49.367
Armenian?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.232
Iranian?

15:52.234 --> 15:54.302
Kurdish.

15:54.304 --> 15:56.007
I see.

15:57.040 --> 16:01.576
Look, just because were on
different sides doesn't mean...

16:01.578 --> 16:04.712
What were you doing here for
the National Security Council?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.448
Administration.
That's all.

16:06.450 --> 16:09.250
We have run out of time
for you to lie to me.

16:09.252 --> 16:11.589
I told you the one
thing I'd heard.

16:12.589 --> 16:14.392
<i>Sir!</i>

16:26.502 --> 16:29.139
<i>Doctor Chrysler.</i>

16:31.273 --> 16:34.274
The facilities Head
Weaponry Engineer.

16:34.276 --> 16:36.477
What about him?

16:36.479 --> 16:38.545
In fact, the document
I was delivering was for him,

16:38.547 --> 16:40.414
before I got knocked out.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.351
<i>Oh, it was for Chrysler,
was it?</i>

16:43.353 --> 16:47.222
<i>So he was leading this
big project you speak of?</i>

16:47.224 --> 16:50.290
<i>Can't have been
this chamber alone.</i>

16:50.292 --> 16:52.662
<i>I think you know more.</i>

16:57.367 --> 16:59.299
<i>Electricity.</i>

16:59.301 --> 17:02.303
<i>The great emancipator
of men.</i>

17:10.479 --> 17:13.313
<i>Chilean dictator,
General Pinochet,</i>

17:13.315 --> 17:16.383
<i>would strap his enemies
to a parrilla.</i>

17:16.385 --> 17:19.521
<i>A metal frame pumped
with high voltage,</i>

17:19.522 --> 17:22.392
<i>shocking them over
and over.</i>

17:36.373 --> 17:37.505
<i>I guess you could say,</i>

17:37.507 --> 17:41.109
<i>you are now walking on
one big parrilla.</i>

17:52.322 --> 17:54.091
<i>Had enough?</i>

17:55.225 --> 17:57.092
<i>Go to the glass.</i>

17:57.094 --> 17:59.764
I cant...
Zakarian...

18:00.564 --> 18:03.163
I can't, Zakarian...

18:03.165 --> 18:05.301
I can't!

18:11.708 --> 18:15.646
<i>I said,
go to the glass.</i>

18:31.594 --> 18:33.660
What's happened to her?!

18:33.662 --> 18:36.130
<i>This is human cruelty
incarnate.</i>

18:38.401 --> 18:41.471
<i>The reality of this
country's regime.</i>

19:37.259 --> 19:39.563
What now, Zakarian?
Huh?

19:40.663 --> 19:42.432
What more?

19:44.301 --> 19:46.504
I have nothing.

19:48.337 --> 19:51.541
I literally have nothing.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.509
I'm no good to you!

20:52.434 --> 20:54.238
Ah!

20:54.970 --> 20:56.906
Our new assistant.

20:59.575 --> 21:00.908
Welcome.

21:00.910 --> 21:02.744
Thank you. Uh...

21:02.746 --> 21:05.446
Uh, no ID cards
in this wing.

21:05.448 --> 21:08.852
The guards make sure were the
only ones allowed in or out.

21:10.319 --> 21:11.518
I'm Ed.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.956
Hi, Ed.

21:13.422 --> 21:16.591
Sandra's just setting up
the chemical work station.

21:16.593 --> 21:18.325
Oh. Hi, Sandra.

21:20.462 --> 21:22.432
And...

21:24.301 --> 21:26.633
- Your name?
- Oh! Sorry.

21:26.635 --> 21:28.303
I wasn't sure if
you wanted to know.

21:28.305 --> 21:30.004
Were not machines,
my dear.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.973
I'm Ruth.

21:31.975 --> 21:33.844
<i>Good morning, Ruth.</i>

21:34.611 --> 21:36.546
I'll be right down.

21:40.850 --> 21:42.582
Doctor Elle Chrysler.

21:42.584 --> 21:44.020
An honor!

21:49.592 --> 21:51.024
Have you been handling nuts?

21:51.026 --> 21:53.564
Uh, yes.
In my hand cream.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.464
You should have been told.

21:56.466 --> 21:59.003
All of you just meet me
on the lower level.

22:02.505 --> 22:04.339
We'll go via the bathroom.

22:04.341 --> 22:05.909
Wash your hands thoroughly.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.710
Come on.

22:42.679 --> 22:45.947
<i>This is the final task
of your bi-monthly rotation.</i>

22:45.949 --> 22:48.815
As ever, your country
thanks you for your service

22:48.817 --> 22:50.650
in this time
of desperate need.

22:50.652 --> 22:53.388
Today we welcome Ruth
to our team.

22:53.390 --> 22:54.788
In the space
of a few months,

22:54.790 --> 22:56.724
Ruth has gone
from admin girl

22:56.726 --> 22:58.126
to the brightest brain
in our chemical

22:58.128 --> 23:00.594
engineering development team.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.996
She will be assisting us
over the coming days.

23:02.998 --> 23:04.865
Welcome to the Principal Wing.

23:04.867 --> 23:06.669
Thank you, Doctor Chrysler.

23:07.670 --> 23:09.704
You know the protocol.

23:09.706 --> 23:11.639
No communication
with the outside world

23:11.641 --> 23:13.573
during the testing period.

23:13.575 --> 23:15.976
Once it has concluded,
it never happened.

23:15.978 --> 23:20.547
There will be no record of our
work or even presence here.

23:20.549 --> 23:24.552
Your loyalty and commitment
must be absolute.

23:24.554 --> 23:27.889
Any information leak can
and will be traced back to you.

23:27.891 --> 23:30.190
On pain of death, you must say
and do whatever you have to,

23:30.192 --> 23:31.825
to protect our work.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.565
Become someone else
if need be.

23:36.932 --> 23:37.799
Very good.

23:37.801 --> 23:40.404
You may return
to your work stations.

23:43.972 --> 23:45.739
Doctor Chrysler.

23:45.741 --> 23:47.809
I'm so sorry,
I didn't know.

23:47.811 --> 23:49.811
Are you prepared?

23:49.813 --> 23:51.579
- Sorry?
- For what ever lies ahead.

23:51.581 --> 23:52.913
Are you prepared for it?

23:52.915 --> 23:55.115
Yes, Doctor.
Of course.

23:55.117 --> 23:57.620
I'm here to prove myself.

24:06.629 --> 24:07.928
You have received
little information

24:07.930 --> 24:10.433
about our task
for good reason.

24:20.776 --> 24:22.946
Vocal alteration, please.

24:28.949 --> 24:31.585
<i>You're awake, Zakarian.
Good morning.</i>

24:31.587 --> 24:32.954
Is it morning?

24:32.956 --> 24:34.589
<i>It is.</i>

24:34.591 --> 24:36.823
<i>Early morning in fact.</i>

24:38.894 --> 24:40.227
The guys before you

24:40.229 --> 24:42.766
didn't let me see
the sun either.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.499
So what is this?

24:45.501 --> 24:48.569
<i>Welcome to the
White Chamber.</i>

24:48.571 --> 24:50.474
White Chamber.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.508
Well, for the millionth time,

24:54.510 --> 24:56.710
if you want some information,
I have none.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.912
<i>We aren't interrogators.</i>

24:58.914 --> 25:02.084
<i>You've been given to us
for a very different purpose.</i>

25:03.519 --> 25:06.286
You going to speak
in riddles all day, mate?

25:06.288 --> 25:08.155
Mate? Miss?

25:08.157 --> 25:10.791
Cant really tell
with the sci-fi voice.

25:10.793 --> 25:13.159
<i>You're here to help us
develop a new weapon</i>

25:13.161 --> 25:15.164
<i>in the war effort.</i>

25:16.164 --> 25:19.235
Against my own forces?

25:20.603 --> 25:22.605
Are you stupid?

25:27.809 --> 25:28.842
When you're down there,

25:28.844 --> 25:30.881
never let him
see your face.

25:34.017 --> 25:36.784
Could I get a deodorant
or something?

25:36.786 --> 25:40.023
I forgot to pack
a change of clothes.

25:43.927 --> 25:46.697
Got me wearing
this stupid shit.

25:47.162 --> 25:48.998
Hey!

25:49.832 --> 25:52.033
Anybody in there?
Huh?

25:52.035 --> 25:53.900
Hello?

25:53.902 --> 25:55.769
<i>What about a toilet?</i>

25:55.771 --> 25:59.909
<i>I'd hate to soil this
gleaming White Chamber.</i>

26:00.642 --> 26:03.110
Beautiful by the way.
Well done.

26:03.112 --> 26:04.911
Would you like me
to mute him?

26:04.913 --> 26:06.112
Not for now.

26:06.114 --> 26:08.916
<i>And what's the deal
with this metal floor?</i>

26:08.918 --> 26:11.752
<i>I like the little holes.</i>

26:11.754 --> 26:13.853
<i>Could I get a chair?</i>

26:13.855 --> 26:16.058
<i>Armchair would be preferable.</i>

26:16.793 --> 26:19.563
<i>A mattress?
A nice throw rug?</i>

26:20.330 --> 26:22.263
<i>Maybe some socks...</i>

27:12.949 --> 27:15.619
Cheers.
That was lovely.

27:37.707 --> 27:40.807
Could you turn the lights
down in here?

27:40.809 --> 27:42.845
Or are you guys old school?

27:45.381 --> 27:47.117
It's alright.

27:47.816 --> 27:51.853
I had the sleep deprivation
training in the SAS.

27:55.924 --> 27:57.960
What about a little, um...

28:08.938 --> 28:11.074
Mind readers.

28:17.145 --> 28:20.282
<i>You're worth
far more to us alive, Zakarian.</i>

28:23.452 --> 28:26.120
<i>Do you have much
to live for?</i>

28:26.122 --> 28:28.091
More than you can imagine.

28:29.191 --> 28:31.327
<i>You have my word.</i>

28:53.482 --> 28:56.082
<i>Compliments to the chef.</i>

28:56.084 --> 28:58.854
<i>I'm sure she slaved
over this for hours!</i>

29:01.157 --> 29:03.694
<i>Dessert's next, yes?</i>

29:11.467 --> 29:13.767
Oh, yeah!

29:13.769 --> 29:16.035
Woo, yeah!

29:21.911 --> 29:24.277
Come on!
Let me out of here!

29:29.218 --> 29:30.784
Instantaneous absorption.

29:30.786 --> 29:32.953
Secretion of dopamine
and norepinephrine

29:32.955 --> 29:34.925
have spiked already.

29:48.237 --> 29:50.537
You're showering him again,
Doctor Chrysler?

29:50.539 --> 29:53.940
The water hitting his body
is 2 degrees Celsius.

30:00.917 --> 30:03.149
Body temperature
remains unchanged.

30:03.151 --> 30:04.488
All is normal.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.333
Anything?

30:20.335 --> 30:23.903
His nociceptors have been
totally desensitized.

30:23.905 --> 30:27.174
His brain isn't registering
the temperature change

30:27.176 --> 30:28.909
even though his skin
is on the verge

30:28.911 --> 30:31.046
of first degree burns.

30:40.021 --> 30:41.388
Come on!

30:41.390 --> 30:43.090
Why'd you stop?!

30:43.092 --> 30:45.159
<i>Turn the fucking water
back on.</i>

30:45.161 --> 30:46.060
<i>Now!</i>

30:46.062 --> 30:47.294
- Mute him, please.
- Turn it back on!

30:47.296 --> 30:49.630
For Gods sake, you fuc...

30:49.632 --> 30:51.497
Watch him closely.

30:51.499 --> 30:53.300
How much did they
disclose to you

30:53.302 --> 30:54.968
about what we do here,
Ruth?

30:54.970 --> 30:58.938
They just said, military
related chemical testing.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.477
Exactly.

31:03.912 --> 31:05.848
Follow me, please.

31:17.392 --> 31:19.360
This is Pervitin.

31:19.362 --> 31:21.428
A once legal form
of methamphetamine

31:21.430 --> 31:23.964
used by Nazi soldiers
in World War 2.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.999
It galvanized
their front line,

31:26.001 --> 31:29.469
giving them the focus and
impetus to charge into battle.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.572
Benzoylmethylecgonine.

31:31.574 --> 31:33.040
Cocaine.

31:33.042 --> 31:35.911
Hitler himself was
a known exponent of this.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.214
Hallucinogenic mushrooms
made Zulu warriors

31:40.216 --> 31:42.448
feel immortal when
fighting the British

31:42.450 --> 31:45.387
in the Anglo-Zulu Wars
of 1879.

31:46.455 --> 31:49.055
The Americans in the
jungles of Vietnam

31:49.057 --> 31:52.092
used cannabis and heroin

31:52.094 --> 31:54.264
to cope with the hellish
conditions.

31:55.197 --> 31:57.063
Brown-Brown.

31:57.065 --> 31:59.603
Used by child soldiers
in Sierra Leone.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.069
You see, Ruth,

32:02.071 --> 32:06.476
drugs have been a tactic
in warfare for centuries.

32:17.353 --> 32:19.386
We are to produce
a new stimulant

32:19.388 --> 32:22.555
to help our troops defeat
Zakarian's militia.

32:22.557 --> 32:26.560
A super-amphetamine,
with minimal side effects.

32:26.562 --> 32:28.495
But something this sensitive
and dangerous

32:28.497 --> 32:32.332
can only be achieved through
rigorous trial and error.

32:32.334 --> 32:35.034
Which is what this is?

32:35.036 --> 32:36.736
That's what we built
this chamber for.

32:36.738 --> 32:38.738
For scientific testing.

32:38.740 --> 32:40.676
For progress.

32:47.682 --> 32:49.649
This is where
we are right now.

32:49.651 --> 32:53.219
Alphamethylidinoargentiophenone.

32:53.221 --> 32:56.457
We call it Argo on account
of its silver color.

32:56.459 --> 32:58.257
Which is achieved how?

32:58.259 --> 33:00.393
Not actual silver surely?

33:00.395 --> 33:02.699
No, a harmless
coloring agent.

33:03.732 --> 33:08.267
And his food was laced
with this... Argo?

33:08.269 --> 33:11.405
Three point five grams.
An eighth in street terms.

33:11.407 --> 33:14.774
On the insistence of the
National security Council,

33:14.776 --> 33:17.113
he is our test subject.

33:21.182 --> 33:23.353
Is that alright, Ruth?

33:24.586 --> 33:26.352
Yes.

33:26.354 --> 33:28.455
This war needs to end.

33:28.457 --> 33:30.060
Whatever it takes.

33:31.494 --> 33:33.163
Excellent.

33:34.130 --> 33:36.232
Put these away please,
Sandra.

33:40.503 --> 33:43.203
If you don't mind my asking,
Doctor Chrysler.

33:43.205 --> 33:45.976
How did they capture
Citizen-General Zakarian?

33:49.277 --> 33:51.477
I'm not privy to what
goes in the field.

33:51.479 --> 33:53.046
We must carry out our task

33:53.048 --> 33:55.352
indiscriminate of who
or what they are.

33:57.585 --> 33:59.820
Sandra will get you up to
speed on the precise chemistry

33:59.822 --> 34:01.155
involved here.

34:01.157 --> 34:03.090
Thank you, Sandra.

34:03.092 --> 34:05.027
I'll get your
protective clothing.

34:31.187 --> 34:33.322
Thirty years as
a chemical engineer.

34:34.290 --> 34:36.359
You've got some stories
to tell, I bet.

34:38.527 --> 34:40.496
Nothing worth recounting.

34:42.397 --> 34:45.266
Especially when one considers
what we face now.

34:48.870 --> 34:52.406
I, uh... noticed
Doctor Chryslers perfume.

34:52.408 --> 34:55.109
Her attention to detail
is all encompassing.

34:55.110 --> 34:58.714
A well-scented woman
exudes control.

35:00.181 --> 35:02.718
Unless they're masking
the smell of fear.

35:04.786 --> 35:08.257
Sorry.
I'll finish clearing up.

35:29.444 --> 35:31.745
Something wrong?

35:31.747 --> 35:34.480
This is Malusmercury.

35:34.482 --> 35:36.486
I didn't think it was real.

35:37.352 --> 35:40.322
How do you think our Prime
Minister was assassinated?

35:43.424 --> 35:45.658
But no one was ever caught?

35:45.660 --> 35:48.097
It's a slow killer.

35:48.397 --> 35:50.563
Symptoms of poisoning
didn't show for over a week.

35:50.565 --> 35:52.866
By then it was too late
to save him

35:52.868 --> 35:54.871
or catch the perpetrator.

35:56.172 --> 35:59.573
So I suggest you hold
that bottle with two hands

35:59.575 --> 36:01.810
or don't hold it at all.

36:12.555 --> 36:13.953
Well done today, Ruth.

36:13.955 --> 36:18.527
Your proficiency with chemicals
is quite outstanding.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.460
Thank you... Sandra.

36:21.462 --> 36:23.797
I'm going to get
a few hours rest.

36:23.799 --> 36:25.866
Wait here until someone
comes to relieve you.

36:25.868 --> 36:28.569
- Of course.
- They wont be long.

36:28.571 --> 36:30.737
There's a panic button
in case of emergency.

36:30.739 --> 36:31.737
Got it.

36:31.739 --> 36:35.879
And I will inform the guards
on my way out.

37:37.306 --> 37:38.938
I told you,
he does not see your face!

37:38.940 --> 37:40.339
I... I'm sorry.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.308
I don't care
how talented you are.

37:42.310 --> 37:45.347
One more gross neglect
of protocol and you'll wish...

37:45.980 --> 37:49.482
Please just do as I say.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.884
It's very sensitive work
were doing here.

37:51.886 --> 37:54.390
I'm sorry, Doctor Chrysler.

37:54.957 --> 37:59.525
It's just that the monitors
upstairs aren't on so...

37:59.527 --> 38:01.363
So I...

38:11.040 --> 38:12.638
Hello, Zakarian.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.973
Wakey! Wakey!

38:13.975 --> 38:15.641
I'm still here!

38:15.643 --> 38:17.844
<i>Oh Doctor,
you need to join me.</i>

38:17.846 --> 38:20.513
<i>I've been sitting here
making love to the wall.</i>

38:20.515 --> 38:21.915
<i>Have you noticed
how white it is?</i>

38:21.917 --> 38:23.652
<i>It's so bright...</i>

38:27.455 --> 38:29.589
He's still high?

38:29.591 --> 38:31.493
He should just
be coming down.

38:32.493 --> 38:34.396
Longevity is good.

38:39.667 --> 38:41.903
Get back to work shortly.

38:43.672 --> 38:45.475
For what?

38:46.408 --> 38:47.844
I'm sorry?

38:48.777 --> 38:50.877
I just meant...

38:50.879 --> 38:53.746
alertness, energy,
numbing of pain receptors.

38:53.748 --> 38:57.016
The current recipe seems to be
exactly what were after?

38:57.018 --> 38:59.886
The tests will end
when the Council are happy

38:59.888 --> 39:02.688
that the safest product
has been produced.

39:02.690 --> 39:04.824
We can only ascertain
what that is

39:04.826 --> 39:06.759
by trailing different batches.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.664
Correct?

39:11.500 --> 39:13.969
You may go to your
sleeping quarters.

39:15.571 --> 39:17.040
Yes, Doctor Chrysler.

39:19.440 --> 39:21.808
Aren't you going
to get some sleep?

39:21.810 --> 39:24.080
That's none
of your concern.

39:40.027 --> 39:41.862
Somebody.

39:41.864 --> 39:43.663
Somebody talk to me.

39:43.665 --> 39:45.835
Talk to me, please!

39:46.634 --> 39:48.470
Anyone?!

40:10.192 --> 40:12.929
What kind of
interrogation is this?

40:13.928 --> 40:15.094
Huh?

40:15.096 --> 40:19.565
You drugged me
so I'd give you answers?

40:19.567 --> 40:21.870
You're wasting your time!

40:24.439 --> 40:26.875
God knows
I've been wasting my own.

40:28.977 --> 40:30.980
Who else is in here?

40:39.555 --> 40:41.487
Are these your tactics?

40:41.489 --> 40:43.959
Is this your warfare?
Huh?

40:45.093 --> 40:47.529
Well I'm a Zakarian

40:48.196 --> 40:51.163
and I fight for what I want!

40:51.165 --> 40:53.702
If you're not going
to let me sleep...

40:54.535 --> 40:56.171
I'll do it myself!

41:21.562 --> 41:23.096
What the fuck?

41:23.098 --> 41:25.567
<i>Breakfast
time, Citizen-General Zakarian.</i>

41:32.607 --> 41:34.574
You must think I'm a clown.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.213
<i>Would you prefer it
in pill form?</i>

41:38.680 --> 41:40.917
Go fuck yourself!

41:41.917 --> 41:45.185
<i>Those were the
consensual options.</i>

41:45.187 --> 41:46.053
Oh yeah?

41:46.055 --> 41:47.888
So what are you going
to do now? Huh?

41:59.167 --> 42:00.766
Good morning.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.138
On the control pad today
please, Ruth.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.779
But I haven't been trained?

42:11.812 --> 42:13.612
You haven't what?

42:13.614 --> 42:15.214
I should be right
in assuming you deduced

42:15.216 --> 42:20.085
basic functionality by watching
me over the past 24 hours.

42:20.087 --> 42:23.022
That's the impression
I got last night.

42:23.024 --> 42:25.125
Basics, yes.

42:25.127 --> 42:28.828
Well it all follows
logically from the basics.

42:28.830 --> 42:31.100
I'll talk you through
today's tests.

42:35.337 --> 42:37.837
The smoke contains
a batch of si50.

42:37.839 --> 42:41.274
Slightly modified
and hopefully improved.

42:41.276 --> 42:43.712
Open the vents.

43:00.127 --> 43:01.661
Can you hear me, Zakarian?

43:01.663 --> 43:04.663
Oh yes, Doctor!
Loud and clear!

43:04.665 --> 43:06.632
Good to see you
so compliant.

43:06.634 --> 43:08.268
<i>Well of course!</i>

43:08.270 --> 43:10.069
Lie down on the floor.

43:10.071 --> 43:11.670
Oh Doctor,

43:11.672 --> 43:13.306
you haven't even
bought me dinner yet.

43:13.308 --> 43:15.074
<i>On the floor, please.</i>

43:15.076 --> 43:17.613
See where a few
manners get you?

43:19.948 --> 43:22.752
One milliampere
of electrical current, please.

43:28.156 --> 43:30.924
So how long do you
want me like this?

43:30.926 --> 43:33.094
Fifteen milliamperes.

43:36.765 --> 43:38.698
Oh, that tickled!

43:38.700 --> 43:41.701
Inhibition of nociceptors
is still excellent.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.268
Fifty milliamperes.

43:46.408 --> 43:48.708
Amplified strength,
thats what we were hoping for.

43:50.879 --> 43:53.015
Come on!
Lets go!

43:53.881 --> 43:54.948
<i>Impressive, Zakarian.</i>

43:54.950 --> 43:58.018
<i>Let's see how you handle
80 milliamperes.</i>

44:02.256 --> 44:04.857
Be mindful,
anything over 100 milliamperes

44:04.859 --> 44:07.228
will most likely
cause organ damage.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.199
Shut it off.

44:18.439 --> 44:21.209
<i>You can get up
now, Citizen-General.</i>

44:22.678 --> 44:23.676
<i>Very good.</i>

44:23.678 --> 44:26.812
Your pain threshold has
increased exponentially.

44:26.814 --> 44:28.281
<i>Next, your heart rate
will speed up</i>

44:28.283 --> 44:30.083
<i>as a result of catalyzed
secretion of...</i>

44:30.085 --> 44:32.622
You're Doctor Chrysler,
aren't you?

44:34.355 --> 44:36.723
<i>Yeah!</i>

44:36.725 --> 44:39.027
Yeah, we got intel on you.

44:39.828 --> 44:43.763
That you were brought in
as Head Weaponry Engineer.

44:43.765 --> 44:46.232
So this is what
you came up with?

44:46.234 --> 44:47.433
A torture chamber?!

44:47.435 --> 44:50.370
<i>And were the ones
portrayed as reprobates?!</i>

44:50.372 --> 44:51.571
Should I mute him?

44:51.573 --> 44:53.440
- <i>Look at yourselves in the mirror.</i>
- No.

44:53.442 --> 44:56.109
One hundred and one
milliamperes.

44:56.111 --> 44:57.210
<i>Answer me!</i>

44:57.212 --> 44:58.414
Do it.

44:59.381 --> 45:01.114
<i>Answer me!</i>

45:07.254 --> 45:08.987
That's not fair!

45:08.989 --> 45:11.192
You should warn me first!

45:12.794 --> 45:14.127
Doctor Chrysler.

45:14.129 --> 45:16.161
Yeah, Doctor Chrysler,
I just remembered something!

45:16.163 --> 45:18.832
That's enough from you,
Zakarian!

45:18.834 --> 45:21.400
Rumors were that you
only joined the battle

45:21.402 --> 45:24.770
after you lost one
of your own to the war!

45:24.772 --> 45:27.841
That we killed him!
Huh?

45:27.843 --> 45:31.176
<i>I'm sure he was a stinking
coward, just like you.</i>

45:31.178 --> 45:32.444
Hit him again.

45:32.446 --> 45:34.013
<i>Hiding behind this...</i>

45:44.826 --> 45:46.893
I wish I knew if it was me.

45:46.895 --> 45:49.395
I wish I knew if it was me
who killed him.

45:49.397 --> 45:52.431
Blew his brains out
over the battlefield!

45:52.433 --> 45:54.500
He was just a number,
you know!

45:54.502 --> 45:56.971
<i>A means to a better end!</i>

46:03.444 --> 46:05.178
We can end this test!

46:05.180 --> 46:06.781
No!

46:10.317 --> 46:13.089
Monsters!

46:18.026 --> 46:20.326
Did you disobey me again?

46:20.328 --> 46:22.362
How dare you?!

46:22.364 --> 46:24.864
I didn't!
I promise!

46:24.866 --> 46:25.899
You're finished here.

46:25.901 --> 46:27.466
Do you understand
what that means?

46:27.468 --> 46:29.536
Do you realize what
will happen to you?!

46:29.538 --> 46:31.774
Eleanor!

46:37.511 --> 46:40.115
We got all we needed.

46:41.482 --> 46:44.853
But... Jamie...

47:20.922 --> 47:22.558
Thanks, Ed.

47:26.627 --> 47:28.330
I'm trying to give them up.

47:28.997 --> 47:31.933
Thanks, but I don't smoke.

47:33.368 --> 47:35.871
I bet you're a vegan as well.

47:40.040 --> 47:42.475
Why are you here, Ruth?

47:42.477 --> 47:44.076
Sorry?

47:44.078 --> 47:46.481
Why are you on our side
and not theirs?

47:47.415 --> 47:50.018
It never crossed my mind,
I guess.

47:52.152 --> 47:56.225
To join a rebel cause
always takes a leap of faith.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.327
I was lucky.

47:58.993 --> 48:01.326
I had a great education.

48:01.328 --> 48:03.462
Was able to pursue
my passion.

48:03.464 --> 48:05.964
My family are all safe.

48:05.966 --> 48:09.134
Everything that
led up to this

48:09.136 --> 48:12.571
sort of passed me by...

48:12.573 --> 48:14.576
until it was too late.

48:15.676 --> 48:17.879
Do you want to know
a secret?

48:18.680 --> 48:21.116
I've never even voted.

48:23.051 --> 48:25.183
All I know is...

48:25.185 --> 48:27.856
war isn't a solution
for anything.

48:32.259 --> 48:34.462
I'm sorry about Eleanor.

48:35.062 --> 48:37.596
<i>We try to leave our demons
outside the facility</i>

48:37.598 --> 48:40.935
but were helpless
when they chase us in.

48:41.569 --> 48:45.074
Jamie wasn't just a number...

48:46.573 --> 48:48.409
he was my son.

48:50.245 --> 48:53.078
You're Doctor Edgar Chrysler!

48:53.080 --> 48:54.948
You created the Chamber.

48:54.950 --> 48:56.982
Eleanor and I.

48:56.984 --> 49:00.154
She was my assistant
every step of the way.

49:01.323 --> 49:05.158
I protected her identity
all these years.

49:05.160 --> 49:10.498
Now, I assist her.

49:12.734 --> 49:16.569
<i>Then there was Jamie.
He was...</i>

49:16.571 --> 49:19.138
<i>He was a wonderful boy.</i>

49:19.140 --> 49:22.040
<i>The free spirit
of the family.</i>

49:22.042 --> 49:26.015
Even so, he had no hesitation
about conscripting for service.

49:30.685 --> 49:33.922
He got me this from Africa...

49:40.995 --> 49:43.097
our Jamie.

49:46.167 --> 49:50.203
<i>Elle lost even more.</i>

49:50.205 --> 49:55.641
<i>Her husband David
was also killed in battle.</i>

49:55.643 --> 50:00.379
This war pulled away
the two pillars in her life,

50:00.381 --> 50:03.149
but in opposite directions.

50:03.151 --> 50:06.154
Her husband fought
for the UKLA?

50:07.022 --> 50:10.323
Civil wars divide
allegiances, Ruth,

50:10.325 --> 50:12.694
even amongst family.

50:14.094 --> 50:16.064
Doctor Chrysler.

50:17.064 --> 50:18.130
Who's watching Zakarian?

50:18.132 --> 50:20.636
Everything is under control.

50:22.669 --> 50:28.443
Are there, um, any more tests
planned for today?

50:33.247 --> 50:35.683
Am I a monster, Sandra?

50:37.051 --> 50:39.685
Most certainly not.

50:39.687 --> 50:42.623
You disagree with some of
what you've seen, don't you?

50:45.460 --> 50:48.226
These... tests.

50:48.228 --> 50:50.663
I've never experienced
anything like it before.

50:50.665 --> 50:52.565
What if I let him go?

50:52.567 --> 50:55.204
Would there be another way
to achieve what were doing?

50:56.270 --> 51:00.540
Some way that doesn't
reduce us to their level.

51:00.542 --> 51:02.241
Why Zakarian anyway?

51:02.243 --> 51:06.411
Isn't he more use to the
Council as a bargaining chip?

51:06.413 --> 51:09.714
Would you rather we did
these tests on a civilian?

51:09.716 --> 51:12.317
No... no, of course not.

51:12.319 --> 51:15.754
I would have once asked
myself the same question.

51:15.756 --> 51:18.558
Until the Coronation Day
bombings

51:18.560 --> 51:23.830
when the UKLA took my
entire family away from me.

51:23.832 --> 51:26.165
Just like they've
taken from you.

51:26.167 --> 51:28.234
Without remorse.

51:28.236 --> 51:31.636
There is no right
and wrong in war, Ruth.

51:31.638 --> 51:34.574
No good and evil.

51:34.576 --> 51:36.676
Just a difference
in perception.

51:36.678 --> 51:38.710
It's a great shame
what happened to David,

51:38.712 --> 51:43.748
but because of David,
you know Zakarian.

51:43.750 --> 51:50.556
They revel in our loss
in their crusade.

51:50.558 --> 51:53.893
Zakarian promised
to rejuvenate democracy.

51:53.895 --> 51:55.828
Empower the neglected.

52:00.868 --> 52:03.536
So neglected were they,

52:03.538 --> 52:05.741
they turned to a war-monger.

52:07.575 --> 52:10.846
The White Chamber is where
that animal belongs.

52:12.247 --> 52:15.580
We cannot let our country
fall into the hands of him

52:15.582 --> 52:17.785
and his kind.

52:20.254 --> 52:23.688
Violence is the only language
people speak now.

52:23.690 --> 52:26.661
We have no choice
but to learn it ourselves.

52:29.430 --> 52:32.401
Continue to monitor
the subject.

52:34.402 --> 52:37.539
As you wish, Doctor.

52:43.178 --> 52:45.279
They're getting closer.

53:06.634 --> 53:08.768
Where did you go?

53:08.770 --> 53:10.806
Just a walk.

53:22.649 --> 53:25.319
Help, he's begging for help!

53:28.522 --> 53:30.225
Please!

53:34.529 --> 53:36.495
What's happening in there?

53:36.497 --> 53:39.835
His body temperature
is rising... a lot.

53:41.935 --> 53:44.305
Help me!
Get it out of me!

53:50.578 --> 53:52.346
It'll pass.

53:52.879 --> 53:53.812
Please! Help!

53:53.814 --> 53:56.281
We'll sort that out
in the next batch.

54:38.026 --> 54:39.861
Where's Doctor Chrysler?

54:41.296 --> 54:44.600
The National Security Council
asked to see her.

54:45.433 --> 54:47.268
It's time to feed him.

54:50.837 --> 54:51.973
No.

54:54.509 --> 54:56.445
He can wait.

54:57.344 --> 54:59.779
We need to clear his system
for the next batch.

54:59.781 --> 55:01.580
Go ahead, Ruth.

55:01.582 --> 55:03.752
Voice alteration is on.

55:14.395 --> 55:16.027
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

55:16.029 --> 55:18.633
Like boiled crap.

55:19.433 --> 55:21.433
Why?
Am I looking good?

55:21.435 --> 55:23.835
You're having
withdrawal symptoms.

55:23.837 --> 55:26.071
<i>I'm going to
give you a meal.</i>

55:26.073 --> 55:28.442
<i>You haven't eaten
in 24 hours.</i>

55:29.410 --> 55:31.743
Well could you...

55:31.745 --> 55:33.612
could you season the grub

55:33.614 --> 55:36.351
with a ton of that
junkie stuff, please?

55:36.917 --> 55:38.819
<i>Please!</i>

55:47.761 --> 55:49.730
Is it in there?

55:50.598 --> 55:52.665
Don't worry.

55:52.667 --> 55:54.569
The pain will pass.

56:11.785 --> 56:15.089
You sound like Chrysler
but you're not him are you?

56:17.491 --> 56:19.660
What's your name?

56:20.660 --> 56:22.930
<i>My name doesn't matter.</i>

56:23.631 --> 56:25.801
I just wanted to feed you.

56:41.748 --> 56:44.549
The National Security
Council have informed me

56:44.551 --> 56:47.555
that they've sent over
a new test subject.

56:48.790 --> 56:52.494
We were after a female
weren't we, Sandra?

57:05.705 --> 57:08.109
You may return upstairs,
Ruth.

57:28.663 --> 57:30.399
Anya.

57:30.964 --> 57:32.800
Daran.

57:35.169 --> 57:36.935
God, how did they get you?

57:36.937 --> 57:39.071
I asked you to run.

57:39.073 --> 57:41.806
I guess I'm not good
at listening to your orders.

57:41.808 --> 57:44.044
I can't... Stop.

57:45.645 --> 57:48.147
Anya,
they will come for us,

57:48.149 --> 57:49.415
I am a Zakarian!

57:49.417 --> 57:53.118
- A Zakarian who was about to abandon his comrades.
- No.

57:53.120 --> 57:57.156
No, we built this rebellion
on honor.

57:57.158 --> 57:59.091
They will not forget me.

57:59.093 --> 58:01.759
Their brother.
Their blood.

58:01.761 --> 58:03.998
I love you so much.

58:05.565 --> 58:08.600
Anya,
we will get out of here.

58:08.602 --> 58:09.569
I promise you.

58:09.571 --> 58:11.737
We will get out of here
and we will run far,

58:11.739 --> 58:13.705
far away.

58:13.707 --> 58:15.607
<i>That's very sweet,</i>

58:15.609 --> 58:18.143
<i>but we have use
for both of you yet.</i>

58:18.145 --> 58:20.612
If you do anything to her,

58:20.614 --> 58:22.580
I will kill you, I swear!

58:22.582 --> 58:23.848
What are they talking about,
Daran?

58:23.850 --> 58:25.518
What is this place?

58:26.988 --> 58:28.620
Anya, come to me.

58:28.622 --> 58:30.758
Anya!
Come to me.

58:32.192 --> 58:35.729
We will be fine.
We will survive.

58:37.297 --> 58:39.031
Look at me.

58:39.033 --> 58:40.165
Anya...

58:40.167 --> 58:41.469
Anya.

58:44.305 --> 58:46.774
Anya, baby.

58:49.243 --> 58:51.046
<i>Oh.</i>

58:51.645 --> 58:53.279
<i>No.</i>

58:53.281 --> 58:55.484
<i>Oh no.</i>

58:59.620 --> 59:02.554
What's wrong, baby?

59:02.556 --> 59:04.823
I feel great.

59:07.328 --> 59:09.127
This is...

59:09.129 --> 59:11.700
I've never felt anything
like this before.

59:16.203 --> 59:19.304
Imagine what fucking
on this would be like.

59:22.042 --> 59:23.875
Dopamine,
norepinephrine

59:23.877 --> 59:26.946
and adrenaline levels
have all spiked,

59:26.948 --> 59:28.948
just as Zakarian's did.

59:28.950 --> 59:32.286
Let's test her
pain threshold.

59:39.627 --> 59:42.029
Anya! Anya!

59:42.696 --> 59:44.228
Leave her alone!

59:44.230 --> 59:47.868
Do whatever you want to me
but leave her alone!

59:49.069 --> 59:50.671
What's up?

59:51.872 --> 59:53.241
Anya.

59:56.042 --> 59:57.308
Anya!

59:57.310 --> 59:58.911
Acid?!

59:58.913 --> 01:00:01.312
Why not just use hot water
like with Zakarian?

01:00:01.314 --> 01:00:03.015
Ruth, please.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:04.817
But if anything, it's...

01:00:04.819 --> 01:00:08.089
it's poor experiment practice.

01:00:09.357 --> 01:00:12.223
There are now two independent
variables instead of one.

01:00:12.225 --> 01:00:14.692
But these are
not experiments.

01:00:14.694 --> 01:00:16.362
These are chemical tests

01:00:16.364 --> 01:00:19.864
and testing is the assessment
of the presence,

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:23.571
genuineness or quality
of a product.

01:00:27.174 --> 01:00:30.875
What are you doing?!

01:00:30.877 --> 01:00:34.013
You're just destroying us
for sport now?!

01:00:34.015 --> 01:00:37.082
I'm going to rip
your hearts out!

01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:41.953
What will happen to them
after this?

01:00:41.955 --> 01:00:44.757
Their fate is none
of our concern.

01:00:44.759 --> 01:00:47.158
- Doctor Chrysler!
- Yes, Ruth.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:50.130
Is there a problem?
Any problem at all?

01:00:59.707 --> 01:01:02.643
Would you like me to assist
you with the next cook?

01:01:48.756 --> 01:01:50.825
They don't want the food.

01:01:51.859 --> 01:01:53.995
Just the Argo.

01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:57.799
Then come up here.

01:01:58.998 --> 01:02:01.703
Doctor Chrysler
will be returning soon.

01:02:42.877 --> 01:02:44.978
<i>Everyone gather round.</i>

01:02:48.448 --> 01:02:52.116
The National Security Council
are satisfied with our product.

01:02:52.118 --> 01:02:53.819
The testing process
is complete.

01:02:53.821 --> 01:02:55.453
Congratulations.

01:02:55.455 --> 01:02:57.089
All hands to the pump now,

01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:58.357
we need to produce
an Argo cook

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:00.158
for prototypal tests
in the field.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.393
Batch si47.

01:03:02.395 --> 01:03:04.362
The recipe was fairly
straight forward.

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.330
Si47?

01:03:06.332 --> 01:03:07.332
Yes.

01:03:07.334 --> 01:03:09.835
But that was one of our
earliest batches?

01:03:09.837 --> 01:03:12.304
This often happens
in trial and error, Ruth.

01:03:12.306 --> 01:03:14.373
Ruth, I find it quite
strange that even now

01:03:14.375 --> 01:03:16.945
I have to question
your professionalism.

01:03:20.446 --> 01:03:22.483
Are you going
to cook with us?

01:03:25.852 --> 01:03:28.085
Were nearly done,
my dear.

01:03:28.087 --> 01:03:31.422
Then you can go back
to the real world.

01:03:31.424 --> 01:03:33.091
You can go back to your
family knowing that you've

01:03:33.093 --> 01:03:36.498
played your part in securing
a safe future for them.

01:03:37.598 --> 01:03:38.797
Until the next time, right?

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:41.936
- There wont be a next time if you don't...
- Eleanor.

01:03:43.603 --> 01:03:46.406
I'm sorry I sounded
unprofessional.

01:03:49.310 --> 01:03:51.409
Is this batch si47?

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:52.544
No.

01:03:52.546 --> 01:03:55.948
That is what remains
of batch si58.

01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:58.317
- Shall I dispose of it?
- No. Give it to the female subject.

01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:00.919
But we just gave them
both a dose each!

01:04:00.921 --> 01:04:02.420
That's an order, Ruth.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.926
You're really
slowing us down now.

01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:31.819
I'm sorry.

01:05:28.942 --> 01:05:31.609
Look at my face.

01:05:31.611 --> 01:05:34.047
Remember it.

01:05:34.948 --> 01:05:37.251
My name is Eleanor Chrysler.

01:05:39.687 --> 01:05:42.257
And You killed my brother

01:05:43.189 --> 01:05:46.293
and you sent my husband
to his death.

01:05:47.361 --> 01:05:49.596
Your husband fought for us?

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:54.234
What was his name?

01:05:56.602 --> 01:06:01.241
I know the name of every soldier
who died for our cause.

01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:06.614
His name...

01:06:07.247 --> 01:06:10.350
was David Marcus Yearwood

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:15.022
and he was the love
of my life.

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.093
I knew him.

01:06:19.426 --> 01:06:22.294
Don't you lie about him.

01:06:22.296 --> 01:06:24.131
Don't you dare!

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:28.503
Son of Pamela
and Isaac Yearwood.

01:06:30.103 --> 01:06:32.404
You see, I know

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:35.243
because I called them myself.

01:06:36.343 --> 01:06:40.080
Told them how brave
their son was.

01:06:41.714 --> 01:06:45.553
How he was one of our finest
Company Commanders.

01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:51.258
You see, we care for
the people of this country.

01:06:56.296 --> 01:06:59.663
What are you
to the Council

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:05.069
but a tool to fortify
their autonomy?

01:07:05.071 --> 01:07:07.075
By doing this,

01:07:08.642 --> 01:07:14.681
you're destroying everything
that David lived for.

01:07:15.248 --> 01:07:17.084
Fought for.

01:07:17.718 --> 01:07:20.087
Loved for...

01:07:21.687 --> 01:07:24.291
and died for.

01:07:32.165 --> 01:07:34.634
Witness hell, Zakarian.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.384
Anya.

01:08:24.218 --> 01:08:25.819
No.

01:08:27.153 --> 01:08:28.587
What are you doing?
No!

01:08:28.589 --> 01:08:30.358
No!

01:08:32.326 --> 01:08:35.430
Anya!
No!

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:43.167
Oh God!

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.104
Oh God.

01:08:46.406 --> 01:08:48.439
Anya. No.

01:08:48.442 --> 01:08:49.740
No.

01:08:49.742 --> 01:08:50.908
No, baby. No.

01:08:50.911 --> 01:08:53.911
No!
God, what are you doing?! No!

01:08:53.912 --> 01:08:55.782
No!

01:08:57.283 --> 01:08:59.283
Oh, God, Anya!

01:08:59.286 --> 01:09:02.219
No! No!

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:07.761
I'm going to rip you apart,
Chrysler!

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:31.950
There we are.

01:09:31.952 --> 01:09:35.288
The last of the silver dye
and the last cook.

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:42.194
Thank you.
All.

01:09:42.196 --> 01:09:45.196
Thank you for the opportunity,
Doctor Chrysler.

01:09:45.198 --> 01:09:47.865
Well done, Doctor Chrysler.

01:09:47.867 --> 01:09:49.366
Yes.

01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:51.470
Thank you, Doctor.

01:09:53.706 --> 01:09:54.972
Okay.
Once you've cleared up,

01:09:54.974 --> 01:09:56.674
you may return
to your quarters

01:09:56.676 --> 01:09:58.410
to gather your belongings.

01:09:58.412 --> 01:10:00.378
You'll then be escorted
from the facility

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:03.384
and transported back
to your civilian homes.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.993
If you're wondering
about the test subjects.

01:10:14.995 --> 01:10:18.666
I imagine an armed unit will
be picking them up shortly.

01:10:19.265 --> 01:10:20.768
To take them where?

01:10:21.602 --> 01:10:24.636
You're intelligent enough
to work it out, Ruth.

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:27.405
We're living under
martial law.

01:10:27.407 --> 01:10:29.341
They're enemies of the State.

01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:31.778
They will be dealt with
accordingly.

01:11:04.377 --> 01:11:06.746
What are you doing
down here, Ruth?

01:11:08.447 --> 01:11:10.684
You're just going
to put them down?

01:11:14.054 --> 01:11:16.687
What I've seen
over the last 5 days

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:21.861
has dismantled every principle
I've lived my life by.

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:27.234
These tests.

01:11:29.303 --> 01:11:30.901
No one...

01:11:30.903 --> 01:11:34.575
no thing deserves this.

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:37.310
He's right.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:41.679
We are monsters.

01:11:41.681 --> 01:11:43.948
Just...
just stop right there.

01:11:43.950 --> 01:11:46.551
Revenge.

01:11:46.553 --> 01:11:49.454
That's all this was about
for you, Doctor Chrysler.

01:11:49.456 --> 01:11:53.527
You were driven by revenge.

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:57.661
What drove you, Ruth?

01:11:57.663 --> 01:12:00.867
Ambition?
To prove yourself?

01:12:02.602 --> 01:12:06.670
"Whatever it takes."
Those were your words.

01:12:06.672 --> 01:12:10.741
You're just as responsible
for all of this as we are.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.811
Now just step away
from the control panel.

01:12:12.813 --> 01:12:14.448
No!

01:12:15.549 --> 01:12:17.816
No.

01:12:17.818 --> 01:12:20.718
The world needs to know
what's gone on here.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.357
The truth about this regime.

01:12:25.492 --> 01:12:30.064
I hate that I was too afraid
to say anything...

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:34.367
and that I played a part.

01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:38.869
Do you know what
the Council would do to you

01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.137
if you tried to talk?

01:12:40.139 --> 01:12:42.042
I don't care!

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:44.909
This is wrong.

01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:48.448
This is evil.

01:12:50.649 --> 01:12:54.522
This isn't what Jamie or David
would have wanted.

01:13:08.868 --> 01:13:11.572
You're a disgrace
to their memory.

01:13:21.447 --> 01:13:23.116
Doctor Chrysler?

01:13:33.727 --> 01:13:35.028
What have you done?

01:13:35.862 --> 01:13:38.599
She... she...

01:13:39.498 --> 01:13:41.031
She was...
She was...

01:13:41.033 --> 01:13:44.468
- She was going to...
- I just want to get you sat up.

01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:45.936
Now Ruth, listen.

01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:48.039
Listen to me.
We need to put pressure on it.

01:13:48.041 --> 01:13:49.007
Yes?

01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:50.141
We need to put pressure on it

01:13:50.143 --> 01:13:51.810
and were going to get
help for you.

01:13:51.812 --> 01:13:53.011
Yes?

01:13:53.013 --> 01:13:55.646
I've got to get her
medical assistance.

01:13:55.648 --> 01:13:58.118
No. No. No!
You can't tell anyone.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.090
Edgar.
This is murder.

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:06.790
Oh. What now?

01:14:06.792 --> 01:14:10.494
Now, outside of the chamber,
death shocks you?

01:14:10.496 --> 01:14:13.698
When it becomes real and
not just pixels on a screen!

01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.868
What compassion
did they show Jamie, Dad?!

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.003
We're trying to restore
peace to our country.

01:14:20.005 --> 01:14:21.705
I couldn't let her
leak any...

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:24.575
Eleanor!
You're out of control.

01:14:24.577 --> 01:14:29.813
Why don't you give me
your lab coat

01:14:29.815 --> 01:14:34.552
and I will...
dispose of it.

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.119
Ruth.

01:14:36.121 --> 01:14:38.490
Ruth, listen to me.

01:14:38.492 --> 01:14:39.624
Everything's
going to be alright.

01:14:39.626 --> 01:14:41.758
You're going to be fine.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:42.893
Now listen.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:44.294
- Sandra's going to get help. Alright?
- Yes. Yes.

01:14:44.296 --> 01:14:47.664
- She's going to get the medics.
- What have I done? What have I done?

01:14:47.666 --> 01:14:50.737
- They're only a few minutes away. Alright?
- Oh my God.

01:14:53.506 --> 01:14:54.938
But we have
to keep pressing.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.740
We have to stop
the bleeding.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:57.844
Alright?

01:15:15.562 --> 01:15:17.797
- Oh my God.
- Eleanor.

01:15:18.532 --> 01:15:21.298
We have to get help
for this young woman.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.868
Yes. Yes!

01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:44.190
Run.

01:15:48.894 --> 01:15:52.163
You never should have
built that thing, old man.

01:15:52.165 --> 01:15:52.896
It was me.

01:15:52.898 --> 01:15:54.934
I'm responsible
for all of this.

01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:57.770
Eleanor Chrysler.

01:15:59.605 --> 01:16:01.908
The most beautiful devil.

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:10.815
You're a hypocrite.

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:14.151
Oh...
stronger than you look.

01:17:24.657 --> 01:17:25.957
Run, Eleanor!

01:17:29.929 --> 01:17:31.899
Dad...

01:17:55.255 --> 01:17:56.219
Oh!

01:17:56.221 --> 01:17:57.288
Oh, thank God!

01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:59.923
Please help us!
Please help us!

01:18:02.327 --> 01:18:03.761
Clear!

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:59.318
Who is responsible for this?

01:19:04.056 --> 01:19:05.858
This one is still alive.

01:19:07.493 --> 01:19:09.429
Who is she?

01:19:13.366 --> 01:19:15.836
What now, Zakarian?
Huh?

01:19:17.036 --> 01:19:18.906
What more?

01:19:20.406 --> 01:19:22.743
I have nothing.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:28.114
I literally have nothing.

01:19:28.447 --> 01:19:30.817
I'm no good to you.

01:20:12.959 --> 01:20:15.362
Why did you
let me kill her?

01:20:17.197 --> 01:20:20.030
Anya was a...

01:20:20.032 --> 01:20:23.269
she was a cancer
to the UKLA.

01:20:24.370 --> 01:20:27.974
Worse than the one
growing in my lungs.

01:20:29.341 --> 01:20:32.779
She...
She turned my brother's head.

01:20:34.581 --> 01:20:37.551
Convinced him
to abandon our cause...

01:20:39.452 --> 01:20:42.152
after all these years.

01:20:42.154 --> 01:20:43.954
But I'm... just...

01:20:43.956 --> 01:20:48.795
Yes, you're just
an admin girl aren't you.

01:20:49.127 --> 01:20:51.465
Eleanor Chrysler.

01:20:55.934 --> 01:20:58.335
Just kill me then.

01:20:58.337 --> 01:21:00.273
I did all of this.

01:21:01.875 --> 01:21:04.178
I tortured your brother.

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:08.849
And I...
I killed a girl.

01:21:10.015 --> 01:21:12.152
An innocent girl.

01:21:17.657 --> 01:21:20.360
I have nothing left.

01:21:21.461 --> 01:21:24.231
I deserve to die.

01:21:25.098 --> 01:21:27.466
I deserve to die.

01:21:34.907 --> 01:21:36.606
Get dressed.

01:21:36.608 --> 01:21:39.011
There's work to be done.

01:21:40.612 --> 01:21:42.982
This stuff.

01:21:45.117 --> 01:21:48.254
It took my brother
beyond humanity.

01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.024
I've found it, haven't I?

01:21:53.026 --> 01:21:55.229
Chrysler's weapon.

01:21:55.961 --> 01:21:58.965
The weapon thats going to put
an end to this conflict.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.035
No.

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:41.241
I've seen how much you value
your life, Eleanor.

01:22:42.407 --> 01:22:44.475
Help...

01:22:44.477 --> 01:22:47.680
Everything I put you
through in that chamber

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:52.184
and yet it's one of these

01:22:54.252 --> 01:22:56.223
that breaks you.

01:23:14.540 --> 01:23:16.676
No more lies.

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:21.181
No more wasting time
I don't have.

01:23:22.782 --> 01:23:26.083
You win this war for us

01:23:26.085 --> 01:23:28.422
and you can name your price.

01:23:36.795 --> 01:23:39.065
You know what
you need to do.

01:23:40.399 --> 01:23:43.069
What this country
needs you to do.

01:23:45.203 --> 01:23:50.277
What David would have
wanted you to do.

01:24:11.163 --> 01:24:13.630
Somewhere along the way,

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:17.435
this country turned
its back on grace.

01:24:17.437 --> 01:24:20.303
The same grace
that made it great.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:25.810
That which welcomed two
little orphan boys from Halabja.

01:24:25.812 --> 01:24:28.482
Helped them build
a better life.

01:24:32.684 --> 01:24:37.721
The paradox of waging war
to regain that grace

01:24:37.723 --> 01:24:40.658
is worth dying for...

01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.494
or at least thats what all
who fight for me believe.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:48.298
But you and I both know
that when this ends,

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:51.302
there will be no winners.

01:24:51.304 --> 01:24:53.573
Only survivors.

01:25:04.282 --> 01:25:07.086
I need more coloring agent.

01:25:17.496 --> 01:25:18.896
Got it.

01:25:30.143 --> 01:25:32.743
Right.
Lets get geared up.

01:25:32.745 --> 01:25:34.578
Safety first.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.716
Got a long night ahead.

01:25:58.306 --> 01:26:03.306
