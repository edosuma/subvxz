12:17.218 --> 12:19.202
WELL, IT HAD
A LITTLE SIDE EFFECT.

12:19.302 --> 12:21.118
WHAT KIND OF
SIDE EFFECT?

12:21.218 --> 12:22.494
THE KIND THAT GETS ME
PROMOTED.

12:22.594 --> 12:24.386
I KNOW--PERSONAL GAIN.
I'VE ALREADY BEATEN
MYSELF UP OVER IT.

12:25.053 --> 12:28.161
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

12:28.261 --> 12:29.537
DEMON!

12:29.637 --> 12:30.846
ENERGY BALL!

12:41.219 --> 12:44.804
ENOUGH OF THIS.
BYE-BYE.

12:48.429 --> 12:51.537
UH-OH.

12:51.637 --> 12:52.871
TWO WITCHES.

12:52.971 --> 12:54.971
DAMN HER!

12:55.303 --> 12:57.012
OK...

12:58.512 --> 13:00.054
PAIGE...
YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:01.219 --> 13:03.370
I'M FINE. I'M FINE.

13:03.470 --> 13:05.119
JUST MY EGO'S
A LITTLE BRUISED,
THAT'S ALL.

13:05.219 --> 13:08.079
THAT WAS ODD.

13:08.179 --> 13:10.079
YEAH.

13:10.179 --> 13:11.303
LEO!

13:12.387 --> 13:13.096
WHAT HAPPENED?

13:15.762 --> 13:16.662
SAME OLD.

13:16.762 --> 13:17.662
DEMON TRIED
TO KILL US.

13:17.762 --> 13:19.245
YEAH, A VERY
POWERFUL DEMON,

13:19.345 --> 13:21.537
STRANGELY SOURCE-LIKE.

13:21.637 --> 13:23.246
CAN'T WE GET A FREAKIN'
DAY OFF AROUND HERE?

13:23.346 --> 13:25.455
THAT'S WHY THE ELDER
SUMMONED ME.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.371
THE SOURCE'S DEATH
HAS CREATED A POWER STRUGGLE
IN THE UNDERWORLD,

13:27.471 --> 13:30.204
AND KILLING YOU
MEANS DIRECT ASCENSION
TO THE THRONE.

13:30.304 --> 13:32.830
SO VANQUISHING
THE SOURCE
MEANT NOTHING.

13:32.930 --> 13:35.538
WELL, IT MEANT
A LOT, ACTUALLY.

13:35.638 --> 13:37.538
IT SET BACK EVIL
DECADES.

13:37.638 --> 13:39.120
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S MADE YOU ANY LESS
OF A TARGET.

13:39.220 --> 13:41.120
YEAH, BUT THIS DEMON
DIDN'T EVEN SEEM
TO KNOW WHO WE WERE,

13:41.220 --> 13:43.204
WHICH, BY THE WAY,
I FIND INSULTING.

13:43.304 --> 13:46.121
WELL, HE KNOWS NOW,
WHICH MEANS YOU'D BETTER
FIGURE OUT WHO HE IS

13:46.221 --> 13:49.663
BEFORE HE TRIES AGAIN.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.371
ATTIC.

13:51.471 --> 13:52.555
HMMPH!

14:04.180 --> 14:07.788
"MY LOVE IS STRONG,
MY SPIRIT WEAK,

14:07.888 --> 14:10.413
"IT IS AN ANSWER
THAT I SEEK;

14:10.513 --> 14:12.913
"A QUESTION BURNS
WITHIN THIS FIRE,

14:13.013 --> 14:15.664
SO I MAY HEAR
MY HEART'S DESIRE."

14:15.764 --> 14:18.121
Piper: PHOEBE!
WE HAVE A--

14:18.221 --> 14:20.347
PHOEBE?

14:25.221 --> 14:28.456
WHAT'S GOING ON?

14:28.556 --> 14:30.121
HOW DID I GET HERE?

14:30.221 --> 14:32.221
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT
QUESTION.

14:33.221 --> 14:35.664
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

14:35.764 --> 14:38.623
ME? WHAT--

14:38.723 --> 14:40.121
WHO--WHO ARE YOU?

14:40.221 --> 14:42.205
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

14:42.305 --> 14:44.081
DON'T YOU
RECOGNIZE ME?

14:44.181 --> 14:46.221
I'M YOU--PHOEBE.

14:46.931 --> 14:49.014
PHOEBE?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.181
THAT'S MY NAME,
TOO.

14:54.221 --> 14:57.221
OH, BOY.

14:59.639 --> 15:03.121
WHO--WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

15:03.221 --> 15:06.581
AND HOW DID I
GET UP HERE?

15:06.681 --> 15:08.706
Phoebe: YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE SCARED OF US, HONEY.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.874
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OK.

15:10.974 --> 15:12.598
ANY IDEAS?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.122
Piper: IT'S YOUR SPELL.
DON'T LOOK AT ME.

15:15.222 --> 15:17.415
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
YOUR IDEA.

15:17.515 --> 15:19.373
EXCUSE ME?

15:19.473 --> 15:20.373
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO STOP HER

15:20.473 --> 15:22.248
BEFORE SHE CLIMBS
OUT THE WINDOW.

15:22.348 --> 15:24.290
WHOA! SWEETIE!
HEY! COME HERE!

15:24.390 --> 15:27.222
LOOK! HI.

15:27.432 --> 15:30.807
I CAN EXPLAIN.

15:31.222 --> 15:34.498
YOU...
ARE DREAMING.

15:34.598 --> 15:37.498
DREAMING?!

15:37.598 --> 15:39.123
YES, DREAMING,

15:39.223 --> 15:41.222
AND YOU'RE GONNA
WAKE UP IN YOUR ROOM,

15:41.598 --> 15:45.122
AND EVERYTHING
IS GONNA BE FINE.

15:45.222 --> 15:47.099
I'M 10.
I'M NOT STUPID.

15:47.932 --> 15:51.041
GRAM!

15:51.141 --> 15:53.415
WOW! I DO <i>NOT
</i> MISS THAT.

15:53.515 --> 15:56.248
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:56.348 --> 15:57.682
COLE?

15:58.807 --> 16:00.099
WHO ARE YOU?

16:01.141 --> 16:02.223
MAYBE THIS WILL
REFRESH YOUR MEMORY!

16:04.224 --> 16:07.000
OH!

16:07.100 --> 16:08.100
Old Phoebe:
YOU BASTARD!

16:10.100 --> 16:13.223
WHA--WHAT WAS THAT
ALL ABOUT?

16:14.223 --> 16:17.333
ASK HIM.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.000
Leo: UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO LOOK FOR LITTLE PHOEBE

16:19.100 --> 16:21.166
BEFORE SHE ESCAPES
INTO 2002?

16:21.266 --> 16:23.541
YES. WE WILL DO
THAT, AND YOU

16:23.641 --> 16:26.123
TALK TO
YOUR FUTURE SELF

16:26.223 --> 16:28.123
AND FIX THIS, FAST.

16:28.223 --> 16:29.123
FUTURE SELF?

16:29.223 --> 16:30.123
WHAT ABOUT
THE DEMON?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.124
WHAT DEMON?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.833
WE WERE ATTACKED
DOWNSTAIRS. PAIGE?

16:32.933 --> 16:34.223
I'M THERE.

16:34.516 --> 16:36.183
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW SHE GOT HERE?

16:38.223 --> 16:39.683
I CAST A SPELL TO HEAR
MY HEART'S DESIRE,

16:39.933 --> 16:43.683
AND I GUESS MY PAST SELF
AND MY FUTURE SELF

16:45.223 --> 16:48.666
SHOWED UP
TO HELP ME LISTEN.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.123
AND WHAT DESIRE DID
YOU WANT TO HEAR?

16:50.223 --> 16:52.266
WELL, THAT'S BETWEEN
ME AND...ME.

16:53.558 --> 16:56.709
COME ON.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.267
WORRIED?

17:00.225 --> 17:01.809
[SIGHS] DUDE,
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP.

17:04.059 --> 17:05.791
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A DEMON
WHO CAN RECONSTITUTE HIMSELF

17:05.892 --> 17:08.124
LIKE THE SOURCE.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.001
ANYONE COME TO MIND?

17:10.101 --> 17:12.392
COLE?

17:13.101 --> 17:14.223
CAN'T ANYBODY HELP ME?

17:20.599 --> 17:23.876
WELCOME BACK.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.223
I DIDN'T WANT TO
COME BACK.

17:27.474 --> 17:29.124
AND YET YOU HAVE.

17:29.224 --> 17:30.917
THE SOURCE IS GETTING
STRONGER IN YOU.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.292
I'VE GOT HIM
UNDER CONTROL.

17:33.392 --> 17:35.709
OR IS IT
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

17:35.809 --> 17:37.792
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
HE WANTS YOU TO TELL ME.

17:37.892 --> 17:40.834
MAYBE IT'S THAT
YOUR PLAN IS GONNA FAIL

17:40.934 --> 17:44.167
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
PHOEBE'S CONJURED UP

17:44.267 --> 17:46.292
HER OWN WAY OF
SEEING INTO THE FUTURE.

17:46.392 --> 17:48.225
HER FUTURE SELF--

17:49.518 --> 17:50.835
SOMEBODY WHO'LL BE
ALL TOO WILLING

17:50.935 --> 17:52.251
TO TELL HER
WHAT I CAN'T.

17:52.351 --> 17:53.768
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?

17:55.393 --> 17:57.251
I DON'T NEED TO SEE
THE FUTURE TO KNOW
ABOUT GOOD WITCHES.

17:57.351 --> 18:01.044
THEY'RE OVERLY
CAUTIOUS BY NATURE.

18:01.144 --> 18:04.125
HER FUTURE SELF
WILL BE TOO AFRAID
TO SAY ANYTHING

18:04.225 --> 18:07.125
THAT MIGHT MAKE
THINGS WORSE FOR HER
AND HER SISTERS.

18:07.225 --> 18:10.125
SHE'LL PRESERVE
THE FUTURE.

18:10.225 --> 18:12.960
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

18:13.060 --> 18:15.543
I'VE BEEN A SEER
LONGER THAN YOU'VE
BEEN THE SOURCE.

18:15.643 --> 18:19.044
YOU'LL LEARN TO
TRUST MY INSTINCTS.

18:19.144 --> 18:21.125
I'M NOT THE SOURCE.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.168
BUT YOU <i>WILL
</i> BE VERY SOON!

18:22.268 --> 18:25.125
IT'S YOUR DESTINY!

18:25.225 --> 18:26.209
MY DESTINY
IS TO BE WITH PHOEBE!

18:26.309 --> 18:28.752
I WON'T CHANGE THAT
AND NEITHER WILL THIS
THING INSIDE OF ME!

18:28.852 --> 18:31.643
YOUR LOVE WON'T BE
ENOUGH TO SAVE YOU
IN THE END!

18:31.852 --> 18:35.085
YOU'LL SEE.

18:35.185 --> 18:37.418
KURZON WILL BE
ATTACKING THEM
AGAIN VERY SOON--

18:37.518 --> 18:40.085
THIS TIME,
MORE PREPARED.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.960
YOU'D BETTER
HURRY BACK

18:42.060 --> 18:43.853
IF YOU WANT THEM
TO SURVIVE.

18:50.644 --> 18:53.753
HA HA!

18:53.853 --> 18:55.686
AH! THE GOOD OLD DAYS!

18:56.769 --> 19:00.544
OF COURSE, NOBODY'S
GOING TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY

19:00.644 --> 19:02.586
UNTIL YOU STOP
DRESSING LIKE A TRAMP.

19:02.686 --> 19:05.226
A TRAMP? THAT IS
SO "IN" RIGHT NOW.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.961
OH, YOU'LL LEARN.

19:09.061 --> 19:11.352
LEARN WHAT?

19:15.728 --> 19:18.794
OH!

19:18.894 --> 19:20.753
LOOK AT US! HA HA!

19:20.853 --> 19:22.836
WE HAD SUCH PROMISE.

19:22.936 --> 19:25.126
OK, WHAT
DO YOU MEAN?

19:25.226 --> 19:28.126
DOES SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN TO ME?

19:28.226 --> 19:29.836
I MEAN, US?

19:29.936 --> 19:33.003
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:33.103 --> 19:34.628
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR GAMES, OK?

19:34.728 --> 19:36.629
THERE IS A DEMON--

19:36.729 --> 19:38.004
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT DEMONS!

19:38.104 --> 19:40.128
I KNOW
PLENTY ABOUT DEMONS.

19:40.228 --> 19:43.687
OK. THEN, PLEASE,
TELL ME WHAT YOU
KNOW ABOUT COLE.

19:45.395 --> 19:48.187
LOOK, I'M ABOUT TO
MARRY HIM,

19:49.104 --> 19:50.228
AND I HAVE THIS
REALLY BAD FEELING.

19:50.729 --> 19:54.211
DO YOU REMEMBER
FEELING LIKE THAT?

19:54.311 --> 19:56.020
I REMEMBER...

19:58.353 --> 20:00.227
BUT I WON'T
CHANGE THE PAST.

20:02.062 --> 20:05.127
BUT THIS ISN'T
THE PAST.

20:05.227 --> 20:06.128
THIS IS THE PRESENT.

20:06.228 --> 20:07.128
BUT IT'S <i>MY</i> PAST,

20:07.228 --> 20:08.837
AND I INTEND TO
KEEP IT THAT WAY.

20:08.937 --> 20:10.837
YOU KNOW, I ALREADY
SAW YOU SLAP HIM
ACROSS THE FACE,

20:10.937 --> 20:13.545
SO THAT'S A PRETTY BIG
COMING ATTRACTION FOR MY
LIFE, DON'T YOU THINK?

20:13.645 --> 20:16.795
THAT WAS BETWEEN
HIM AND ME.

20:16.895 --> 20:19.227
I KNOW, BUT YOU ARE ME.

20:20.270 --> 20:22.227
OH, OK. UM...

20:23.645 --> 20:26.253
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A LITTLE HINT, YOU KNOW?

20:26.353 --> 20:28.712
LIKE, DO YOU GUYS
GET DIVORCED?

20:28.813 --> 20:31.088
DOES HE, UM...
DOES HE CHEAT ON YOU?

20:31.188 --> 20:34.128
DID YOU EVER
GET MARRIED?

20:34.228 --> 20:36.963
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE AREN'T MARRIED
IN THE FUTURE?

20:37.063 --> 20:40.228
BECAUSE THERE'S
NO WEDDING RING
ON YOUR FINGER.

20:43.228 --> 20:46.504
PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED.

20:46.604 --> 20:48.171
LOOK, THE SPELL
WOULDN'T HAVE WORKED

20:48.271 --> 20:49.838
IF YOU WEREN'T
ALLOWED TO TELL ME.

20:49.938 --> 20:51.228
I DIDN'T NEED A SPELL
TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

20:54.228 --> 20:56.105
YOU MUST MAKE THIS DECISION
WITHOUT USING MAGIC...

20:59.228 --> 21:02.338
JUST LIKE I DID.

21:02.438 --> 21:04.396
YEAH, AND THAT
WORKED REAL WELL
FOR US, I SEE.

21:07.228 --> 21:10.771
JUST ASK LEO TO
SEND ME BACK AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.546
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK HIM YOURSELF?

21:16.646 --> 21:19.228
BECAUSE I'M STAYING HERE
OUT OF THE PATH OF HISTORY,

21:20.228 --> 21:23.505
AND DON'T ARGUE WITH ME!

21:23.605 --> 21:25.756
WE BOTH KNOW THAT WHEN
OUR MIND'S MADE UP,

21:25.856 --> 21:28.229
THERE'S NO CHANGING IT.

21:29.229 --> 21:30.229
YEAH.

21:32.355 --> 21:33.672
Young Phoebe:
âª ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT âª

21:33.772 --> 21:35.631
âª GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM âª

21:35.731 --> 21:37.547
âª MERRILY, MERRILY,
MERRILY, MERRILY âª

21:37.647 --> 21:39.422
âª LIFE IS BUT A DREAM âª

21:39.522 --> 21:41.422
âª ROW, ROW, ROW YOUR BOAT âª

21:41.522 --> 21:42.756
Piper: HONEY,
YOU'VE GOT TO
LISTEN TO ME.

21:42.856 --> 21:46.089
WE'RE JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

21:46.189 --> 21:47.797
âª LIFE IS
BUT A DREAM âª

21:47.897 --> 21:49.129
OHH!

21:49.229 --> 21:51.129
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

21:51.229 --> 21:52.464
YEAH. DON'T REMIND ME.

21:52.564 --> 21:54.464
Young Phoebe:
âª MERRILY, MERRILY,
MERRILY, MERRILY âª

21:54.564 --> 21:55.797
HAVING A LITTLE
TROUBLE WITH
YOUNG PHOEBE?

21:55.897 --> 21:57.797
YEAH.

21:57.897 --> 21:59.224
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME
WANT TO RECONSIDER
HAVING CHILDREN.

21:59.234 --> 22:01.048
Young Phoebe:
âª MERRILY, MERRILY,
MERRILY, MERRILY âª

22:01.148 --> 22:02.224
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
LIE TO HER AGAIN.

22:02.234 --> 22:03.464
NO. I THINK
I HAVE AN IDEA.

22:03.564 --> 22:06.339
Young Phoebe:
âª GENTLY DOWN THE STREAM âª

22:06.439 --> 22:08.397
STAY AWAY FROM ME,
OR I'LL SIC PRUE ON YOU.

22:09.229 --> 22:12.814
OH, YEAH.
DON'T GO THERE.

22:13.689 --> 22:15.648
UM...

22:19.230 --> 22:22.130
PHOEBE, LISTEN TO ME.

22:22.230 --> 22:24.548
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS SCARY,

22:24.648 --> 22:26.590
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

22:26.690 --> 22:28.130
YOU ARE SAFE
HERE IN THIS HOUSE...

22:28.230 --> 22:30.007
IN <i>YOUR</i> HOUSE...

22:30.107 --> 22:32.231
<i>OUR</i> HOUSE.

22:33.940 --> 22:34.940
YOU KNOW HOW GRAMS
TALKS ABOUT MAGIC
ALL THE TIME,

22:38.230 --> 22:42.130
AND SHE LIKES TO
SAY THAT ANYTHING
IS POSSIBLE,

22:42.230 --> 22:45.673
JUST AS LONG AS
YOU BELIEVE IN IT?

22:45.773 --> 22:47.256
YES.

22:47.356 --> 22:49.173
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT HAPPENED.

22:49.273 --> 22:51.690
MAGIC BROUGHT YOU
HERE TO YOUR FUTURE.

22:54.230 --> 22:56.230
SEE THAT GIRL
RIGHT THERE?

22:57.690 --> 22:59.690
THAT IS PIPER
ALL GROWN UP.

23:00.690 --> 23:03.173
YEAH! HA!

23:03.273 --> 23:05.632
AND THAT IS
HER HUSBAND LEO.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.965
MM-HMM.

23:08.065 --> 23:09.257
AND I AM...

23:09.357 --> 23:12.131
ME?

23:12.231 --> 23:13.633
YEAH.

23:13.733 --> 23:16.132
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

23:16.232 --> 23:18.966
DO YOU
REMEMBER THIS?

23:19.066 --> 23:20.674
DADDY SENT IT
TO YOU AND ME
FOR CHRISTMAS.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.591
MY ALBUM!
YEAH.

23:23.691 --> 23:25.591
EXCEPT IT STARTS
WITH PICTURES
OF YOU,

23:25.691 --> 23:29.424
AND IT GOES
ALL THE WAY--
LOOK BACK HERE--

23:29.524 --> 23:32.966
TO PICTURES OF ME.

23:33.066 --> 23:36.691
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TAKE THAT OVER THERE
AND LOOK AT IT?

23:39.231 --> 23:39.774
NICELY DONE.

23:42.315 --> 23:43.758
WHOO, YEAH.

23:43.858 --> 23:45.131
AT LEAST I CAN
GET THROUGH TO
ONE OF MY SELVES.

23:45.231 --> 23:47.507
HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH GERIATRIC YOU?

23:47.607 --> 23:49.758
I KNOW THAT WOMAN
UP THERE IS ME
WHEN I'M OLD,

23:49.858 --> 23:52.758
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
FAMILIAR ABOUT HER.

23:52.858 --> 23:55.231
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I GOT SO...MEAN.

23:56.524 --> 24:00.382
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW TO REVERSE THE SPELL?

24:00.482 --> 24:02.383
NO. SHE DOESN'T
EVEN REMEMBER
CASTING IT.

24:02.483 --> 24:04.383
HOW DOES <i>THAT
</i> HAPPEN?

24:04.483 --> 24:05.925
WELL, THE FUTURE CHANGES
WITH EVERY CHOICE WE MAKE.

24:06.025 --> 24:08.467
SOME CHOICES CHANGE IT
MORE THAN OTHERS.

24:08.567 --> 24:10.634
ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT
SHE IS HERE FOR A REASON.

24:10.734 --> 24:13.508
THEY BOTH ARE.

24:13.608 --> 24:14.550
YEAH, BUT WHY?
WHAT'S THE REASON?

24:14.650 --> 24:17.884
TO HELP YOU LISTEN
TO YOUR HEART.

24:17.984 --> 24:20.051
AND UNTIL YOU DO, THEY
WON'T RETURN TO THEIR TIMES.

24:20.151 --> 24:23.133
WELL, THEN, I DON'T
THINK THEY'RE EVER
GOING TO,

24:23.233 --> 24:24.900
BECAUSE OLD PHOEBE IS
NOT LETTING GO OF THIS
GRUDGE ABOUT COLE.

24:25.232 --> 24:28.467
TALKING ABOUT ME?

24:28.567 --> 24:29.884
UH!

24:29.984 --> 24:31.300
OH, MY GOSH!

24:31.400 --> 24:34.425
WHO ARE YOU?

24:34.525 --> 24:37.550
SORRY?

24:37.650 --> 24:40.258
THAT GUY IS COLE.

24:40.358 --> 24:43.051
HE'S OUR FIANCE.

24:43.151 --> 24:44.984
WAIT! YOU MEAN
<i>HE'S</i> OUR PRINCE?

24:45.525 --> 24:49.216
THE ONE WHO SWEEPS US
OFF OUR FEET?

24:49.316 --> 24:52.467
PRINCE?

24:52.567 --> 24:53.925
SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT CINDERELLA.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.217
THAT WAS
MY FAVORITE STORY

24:56.317 --> 24:58.259
WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP.

24:58.359 --> 24:59.468
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

24:59.568 --> 25:01.568
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE'S
HERE--TO HELP YOU REMEMBER.

25:05.233 --> 25:09.110
HEH! DON'T YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD HELP PAIGE

25:09.233 --> 25:12.593
FIND OUT WHO THE, UM,

25:12.693 --> 25:13.843
AHEM! VISITOR
WHO DROPPED IN WAS

25:13.943 --> 25:16.133
BEFORE HE
DROPS IN AGAIN?

25:16.233 --> 25:18.968
GOOD IDEA.
OK.

25:19.068 --> 25:21.343
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
KEEP HER COMPANY,
WILL YOU?

25:21.443 --> 25:24.443
YEAH. SURE.

25:29.943 --> 25:33.110
HI.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.317
LOOKING FOR ME?

25:36.609 --> 25:38.968
YOU SENT ME UP AGAINST
THE CHARMED ONES.

25:39.068 --> 25:42.010
WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?

25:42.110 --> 25:43.176
I FORESAW
ONLY ONE WITCH.

25:43.276 --> 25:45.176
HOW WAS I TO KNOW
WHO SHE WAS?

25:45.276 --> 25:47.468
THAT MISTAKE WILL
COST YOU YOUR LIFE!

25:47.568 --> 25:49.427
DON'T BE FOOLISH!
EVERY SOURCE HAS NEEDED ME!

25:49.527 --> 25:52.134
MY VISIONS HAVE BROUGHT
THEM ALL GREAT POWER.

25:52.234 --> 25:54.802
I CAN DO THE SAME
FOR YOU.

25:54.902 --> 25:56.719
SPEAK QUICKLY.

25:56.819 --> 25:57.969
I CAN HELP YOU DESTROY
THE POWER OF THREE.

25:58.069 --> 26:00.344
WITH ONE SIMPLE MOVE.

26:00.444 --> 26:01.802
I CAN MAKE YOU
THE NEXT SOURCE.

26:01.902 --> 26:04.302
IT'S ANOTHER TRICK!

26:04.402 --> 26:06.277
IF IT WERE, WHY
WOULD I HAVE RISKED
MY LIFE TO COME HERE?

26:10.652 --> 26:14.177
ONE OF THE WITCHES
HAS CAST A SPELL,

26:14.277 --> 26:17.218
BROUGHT HER PAST SELF
INTO THE PRESENT.

26:17.318 --> 26:19.944
SHE'S A POWERLESS CHILD
VULNERABLE TO ATTACK.

26:20.194 --> 26:23.134
SO?

26:23.234 --> 26:24.134
SO, KILL THE CHILD,

26:24.234 --> 26:25.719
AND THE PRESENT WITCH
IS NO MORE.

26:25.819 --> 26:27.260
THE ENTIRE LINE
IS EXTINGUISHED,

26:27.360 --> 26:29.610
AND WITH IT,
THE CHARMED ONES.

26:34.944 --> 26:38.134
THAT'S HIM!

26:38.234 --> 26:39.135
"KURZON IS AN ENEMY
OF THE SOURCE

26:39.235 --> 26:41.134
"WHO WAS BANISHED
FROM THE UNDERWORLD

26:41.234 --> 26:42.470
FOR INCITING
A FAILED COUP."

26:42.570 --> 26:43.720
WELL,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:43.820 --> 26:44.762
WHY DIDN'T THEY
JUST KILL HIM?

26:44.862 --> 26:45.720
PROBABLY BECAUSE

26:45.820 --> 26:47.012
IT'S NOT THAT
EASY TO DO.

26:47.112 --> 26:48.273
YOU GUYS ARE
GONNA NEED THE
POWER OF THREE.

26:48.283 --> 26:50.135
BUT IF HE'S
AN ENEMY OF THE SOURCE,

26:50.235 --> 26:51.511
DOESN'T THAT MAKE HIM
OUR ALLY?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.235
NO, HE'S STILL EVIL.
HE'S JUST A DIFFERENT
KIND OF EVIL.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.720
Young Phoebe: AAH!

26:56.820 --> 26:58.095
PHOEBE.
AAH!

26:58.195 --> 27:00.135
AAH!

27:00.235 --> 27:03.261
NO!
HAH!

27:03.361 --> 27:04.720
UHH!

27:04.820 --> 27:06.570
LEAVE THE GIRL ALONE.

27:07.778 --> 27:09.095
BELTHAZOR?

27:09.195 --> 27:10.528
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.

27:11.486 --> 27:13.987
HE IS.

27:19.235 --> 27:22.970
IT'LL TAKE MORE
THAN THAT TO STOP ME.

27:23.070 --> 27:26.135
VERY WELL.

27:26.235 --> 27:27.903
UHH!

27:32.861 --> 27:36.196
THE SOURCE!

27:37.988 --> 27:41.238
COLE?

27:42.486 --> 27:43.279
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.
SHE JUST FAINTED.

27:48.779 --> 27:49.529
YOU OK?

27:52.029 --> 27:53.321
YEAH. I THINK SO.

27:55.862 --> 27:56.486
YOU SAVED ME.

28:08.529 --> 28:11.846
IT WAS SO SCARY.

28:11.946 --> 28:13.386
HE JUST CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE,

28:13.486 --> 28:16.096
AND THEN EVERYTHING
WENT BLACK.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.054
HERE YOU GO,
SWEETHEART.

28:19.154 --> 28:20.486
THANKS.

28:21.279 --> 28:22.154
WHO ARE YOU?

28:24.486 --> 28:26.305
ME? I'M PAIGE.
I'M YOUR--

28:26.405 --> 28:29.763
COUSIN. SHE'S OUR COUSIN
FROM MOM'S SIDE.

28:29.863 --> 28:33.180
BUT WE THINK OF
HER AS A SISTER.

28:33.280 --> 28:34.805
Phoebe: WE'LL
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE OLDER.

28:34.905 --> 28:36.387
WHAT ABOUT THAT SCARY MAN?
WHERE'D HE GO?

28:36.487 --> 28:40.387
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT HIM
ANYMORE, SWEETIE.

28:40.487 --> 28:42.972
DOESN'T SHE?
LEO.

28:43.072 --> 28:44.847
I'M SORRY,
BUT WE CAN'T RISK HER

28:44.947 --> 28:46.055
RUNNING INTO
KURZON AGAIN.

28:46.155 --> 28:47.222
SHE'S PHOEBE'S PAST.

28:47.322 --> 28:48.530
AND COLE SAVING HER
MEANS THAT HE SAVED
ME, TOO.

28:48.947 --> 28:52.487
HELLO! HE LOVES US,
REMEMBER?

28:52.863 --> 28:56.014
[LAUGHS]

28:56.114 --> 28:58.555
I THINK I SHOULD TAKE
LITTLE PHOEBE SOMEPLACE--

28:58.655 --> 29:01.264
SOMEPLACE SAFE.

29:01.364 --> 29:02.482
DO YOU REALLY THINK
KURZON WILL COME BACK?

29:02.492 --> 29:04.264
I DO. I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHY WOULDN'T HE?

29:04.364 --> 29:07.306
HE DIDN'T FULFILL
HIS OBJECTIVES.

29:07.406 --> 29:08.513
Phoebe: HE'S RIGHT.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.387
OK. YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO WITH LEO
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

29:10.487 --> 29:13.555
BUT DON'T WORRY,
HE'LL KEEP YOU SAFE.

29:13.655 --> 29:15.387
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

29:15.487 --> 29:16.763
I KNOW, BUT IT'S JUST
FOR A LITTLE WHILE, OK?

29:16.863 --> 29:19.097
IT'S FOR OUR OWN GOOD.
COME ON.

29:19.197 --> 29:21.306
COME ON.
TAKE MY HAND.

29:21.406 --> 29:23.388
HOLD ON TIGHT.

29:23.488 --> 29:25.388
ARE WE GOING
ON A PLANE?

29:25.488 --> 29:27.407
NO, BUT YOU MIGHT
SEE SOME CLOUDS.

29:35.698 --> 29:39.181
WHERE'D THIS COME FROM?

29:39.281 --> 29:40.723
THAT--THAT'S KURZON'S.

29:40.823 --> 29:42.388
HE TRIED TO
STAB ME WITH IT,

29:42.488 --> 29:43.848
BUT I GOT IT
AWAY FROM HIM.
REALLY?

29:43.948 --> 29:45.681
YOU GOT IT AWAY
FROM A DEMON?

29:45.781 --> 29:46.890
THAT'S
IMPRESSIVE.

29:46.990 --> 29:48.015
WHY DIDN'T HE USE
HIS POWERS ON YOU?

29:48.115 --> 29:49.890
WHO KNOWS?
THE POINT IS THAT, UH,

29:49.990 --> 29:53.388
I STABBED HIM,
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
ENOUGH OF HIS BLOOD

29:53.488 --> 29:55.488
TO SCRY FOR HIM.

29:56.614 --> 29:59.723
YEAH. I'LL GO GET
A MAP AND A CRYSTAL.

29:59.823 --> 30:03.488
YOU THINK KURZON
IS TARGETING
LITTLE PHOEBE?

30:04.488 --> 30:07.556
WHY WOULD HE?

30:07.656 --> 30:09.388
WELL, THE SAME REASON
LEO SAID--

30:09.488 --> 30:10.388
BECAUSE SHE'S YOU,

30:10.488 --> 30:12.388
AND IF HE KILLS HER,

30:12.488 --> 30:13.472
THEN THERE'S
NO CHARMED ONES.

30:13.572 --> 30:14.806
BUT HOW COULD HE KNOW
THAT I CONJURED HER?

30:14.906 --> 30:16.849
HE'S PSYCHIC?

30:16.949 --> 30:19.182
OR MAYBE THE SEER
TIPPED HIM OFF.

30:19.282 --> 30:21.432
THE SEER? YOU THINK
SHE'S INVOLVED?

30:21.532 --> 30:24.974
WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME.

30:25.074 --> 30:27.891
WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT.

30:27.991 --> 30:30.389
OK. WELL, WE'RE GONNA
NEED A VANQUISHING SPELL.

30:30.489 --> 30:33.389
COLE, GO WITH PIPER.

30:33.489 --> 30:34.777
HELP HER. TELL HER
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT KURZON.

30:34.787 --> 30:36.515
Piper: WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

30:36.615 --> 30:38.241
WELL, I'M GONNA TRY
AND GO KNOCK SOME
SENSE INTO MYSELF.

30:48.116 --> 30:51.389
[PHOEBE'S FOOTFALL]

30:51.489 --> 30:53.489
I NEED TO
SEND YOU BACK, FAST.

30:54.489 --> 30:56.389
FINE WITH ME.

30:56.489 --> 30:57.389
NOT FOR YOUR SAKE,
FOR ALL OF OURS--

30:57.489 --> 30:59.390
ESPECIALLY
LITTLE PHOEBE'S.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.849
AND THE ONLY WAY
FOR ME TO DO THAT

31:00.949 --> 31:03.266
IS FOR YOU TO ANSWER
THE QUESTION THAT I ASKED

31:03.366 --> 31:05.389
WHEN I CAST THE SPELL.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.489
SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT
MARRY COLE?

31:08.324 --> 31:10.117
LISTEN TO ME.

31:11.490 --> 31:12.850
A DEMON JUST ATTACKED
DOWNSTAIRS

31:12.950 --> 31:14.390
AND NEARLY KILLED
LITTLE PHOEBE,

31:14.490 --> 31:16.017
WHICH MEANS HE NEARLY
KILLED US, TOO.

31:16.117 --> 31:17.766
I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

31:17.866 --> 31:19.600
THEN WHY WON'T YOU
ANSWER THE QUESTION?

31:19.700 --> 31:21.390
BECAUSE IF I WERE TO SAY
SOMETHING THAT COULD
CHANGE THE FUTURE,

31:21.490 --> 31:24.516
OTHER LIVES COULD BE
AT STAKE, TOO--

31:24.616 --> 31:27.225
NOT JUST OURS.

31:27.325 --> 31:28.975
YEAH? WELL, MAYBE
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
CHANGE THE FUTURE.

31:29.075 --> 31:31.975
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU WERE SENT HERE.

31:32.075 --> 31:34.075
IF THERE IS ONE BELIEF
THAT YOU AND I STILL
HAVE IN COMMON,

31:36.117 --> 31:39.683
IT'S THAT MAGIC
HAPPENS FOR A REASON.

31:39.783 --> 31:42.117
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOU'RE BEING GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE?

31:43.490 --> 31:46.390
TO DO WHAT?

31:46.490 --> 31:48.616
TO KEEP ME FROM
TURNING INTO A BITTER
OLD LADY LIKE YOU!

31:48.992 --> 31:52.142
[SIGHS]

31:52.242 --> 31:54.390
PLEASE...

31:54.490 --> 31:57.490
I HAVE LOST
SO MUCH ALREADY.

31:58.283 --> 32:00.409
DON'T MAKE ME
LOSE MYSELF, TOO.

32:05.701 --> 32:09.201
SORRY. I CAN'T.

32:10.076 --> 32:12.659
THEN I GUESS
YOU'VE DOOMED US BOTH.

32:17.534 --> 32:21.284
[PHOEBE'S
RETREATING FOOTFALL]

32:26.410 --> 32:29.767
YOU DONE
WITH THAT SPELL YET?

32:29.867 --> 32:31.434
ALMOST. COULD YOU
PLEASE STOP PACING?

32:31.534 --> 32:34.559
IT'S VERY DISTRACTING.

32:34.659 --> 32:36.867
NO.

32:38.326 --> 32:41.391
HOW'D IT GO?

32:41.491 --> 32:43.101
I STILL CAN'T GET
THROUGH TO HER.

32:43.201 --> 32:44.391
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THE FUTURE?

32:44.491 --> 32:46.034
NOPE. SHE'S WORRIED
ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES
OF CHANGING IT.

32:47.159 --> 32:49.491
BUT SHE IS YOUR FUTURE.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT?

32:50.993 --> 32:53.018
YES, WE CAN.
OUR LAST TRIP TO
THE FUTURE PROVED THAT.

32:53.118 --> 32:55.894
PHOEBE'S NOT BURNING
AT THE STAKE ANYTIME SOON.

32:55.994 --> 32:58.311
WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL LET ME
CAST PHOEBE'S SPELL AND GET
MY OWN SNEAK PREVIEW.

32:58.411 --> 33:01.144
FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IF I
TAKE THAT PROMOTION OR NOT.

33:01.244 --> 33:04.019
YOU GOT PROMOTED?

33:04.119 --> 33:05.019
YEAH, BY WAY OF A SPELL.

33:05.119 --> 33:07.392
AND HER FRIEND SCOTT GOT STUCK
WITH THE CONSEQUENCE.

33:07.492 --> 33:10.392
Phoebe: UH-OH.
PERSONAL GAIN.

33:10.492 --> 33:11.560
IF YOU DON'T VANQUISH
KURZON SOON,

33:11.660 --> 33:13.227
HE'LL BECOME
THE NEXT SOURCE,

33:13.327 --> 33:14.697
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
PERSONAL GAIN WON'T SEEM
SO IMPORTANT

33:14.707 --> 33:16.560
BECAUSE YOU'LL ALL BE DEAD!

33:16.660 --> 33:18.602
GOT HIM!
HE'S ACROSS TOWN.

33:18.702 --> 33:21.392
OK, BRING THE CRYSTAL.
WE'LL TRACK HIM ON THE WAY.

33:21.492 --> 33:23.492
I WOULD STAY OUT
OF MY BEDROOM
IF I WERE YOU,

33:24.994 --> 33:26.977
UNLESS YOU
WANNA GET SLAPPED AGAIN.

33:27.077 --> 33:29.285
BE CAREFUL.

33:30.492 --> 33:31.285
AREN'T YOU COMING?

33:33.702 --> 33:34.602
WHAT COULD I DO?

33:34.702 --> 33:36.493
I'M NOT A DEMON ANYMORE.

33:50.078 --> 33:53.312
LOOK AT ME.

33:53.412 --> 33:54.493
LOOK AT ME!

33:55.412 --> 33:56.493
YOU SENT KURZON
TO KILL PHOEBE.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.312
YOU BETRAYED ME!

34:00.412 --> 34:02.895
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

34:02.995 --> 34:04.393
YOUR LOVE FOR HER
WAS THE ONLY THING
HOLDING YOU BACK,

34:04.493 --> 34:06.978
THE ONLY THING
KEEPING YOU

34:07.078 --> 34:08.869
FROM ACCEPTING
THE FULL POWER
OF THE SOURCE.

34:11.245 --> 34:14.393
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

34:14.493 --> 34:15.978
WITH HER GONE,

34:16.078 --> 34:17.393
WE WOULDN'T NEED
THE CHARMED ONES
TO KILL KURZON.

34:17.493 --> 34:20.061
YOU'D BE ABLE TO
KILL HIM YOURSELF.

34:20.161 --> 34:21.978
PHOEBE CAN'T DIE.

34:22.078 --> 34:24.103
OTHERWISE THIS SOUL
DIES, TOO.

34:24.203 --> 34:26.393
HIS LOVE FOR HER
IS TOO STRONG,

34:26.493 --> 34:28.768
AND I'LL NEED THAT STRENGTH
IF I'M TO RECAPTURE
WHAT I LOST.

34:28.869 --> 34:31.393
<i>HIS LOVE?</i>

34:31.493 --> 34:32.768
THE SOURCE IS FINALLY
SHOWING THROUGH, I SEE.

34:32.869 --> 34:35.686
YOU'LL HAVE TO KILL HER
EVENTUALLY.

34:35.786 --> 34:37.476
OUR PLAN DEPENDS ON IT.

34:37.577 --> 34:39.895
THAT WAS YOUR PLAN, NOT MINE.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.393
I WANT PHOEBE ALIVE.

34:42.494 --> 34:44.578
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU BETRAY ME...

34:47.494 --> 34:50.661
I WON'T MISS.

34:55.494 --> 34:58.478
HELLO, COLE.

34:58.578 --> 35:00.079
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

35:06.371 --> 35:09.687
WHAT'S THE MATTER, COLE?

35:09.787 --> 35:11.996
AFRAID I'LL TELL THE GIRLS
YOUR SECRET?

35:13.413 --> 35:15.329
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME?

35:16.787 --> 35:17.979
MY LIFE BACK FOR STARTERS.

35:18.079 --> 35:19.854
YOU LOOK ALIVE TO ME.

35:19.954 --> 35:21.494
ON THE OUTSIDE, MAYBE.

35:21.996 --> 35:22.829
I CAN FIX THAT.

35:25.495 --> 35:27.162
YOU CAN'T KILL ME, COLE.

35:29.079 --> 35:31.394
YOU NEVER COULD.

35:31.494 --> 35:33.187
EVEN AFTER THE SOURCE
TOOK YOU OVER,

35:33.287 --> 35:35.855
A PIECE OF YOU ALWAYS
LOVED ME.

35:35.955 --> 35:39.395
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH.

35:39.495 --> 35:41.496
YES, IT CAN BE.

35:42.955 --> 35:44.247
I NEVER MARRIED YOU, COLE.
I CALLED IT OFF.

35:46.705 --> 35:50.188
AND ONCE I FOUND OUT
THAT YOU WERE THE SOURCE,

35:50.288 --> 35:53.495
MY SISTERS AND I
HAD TO VANQUISH YOU.

35:53.621 --> 35:57.230
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

35:57.330 --> 35:58.746
BECAUSE I'VE SPENT
MOST OF MY LIFE

36:00.496 --> 36:03.395
WONDERING WHAT WOULD'VE
HAPPENED IF WE HAD MARRIED.

36:03.495 --> 36:07.395
COULD'VE BEEN DIFFERENT
FOR BOTH OF US.

36:07.495 --> 36:09.688
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR THAT NOW.

36:09.788 --> 36:11.188
MAYBE NOT.

36:11.288 --> 36:13.022
THAT'S WHY I'VE COME
TO YOU FIRST...

36:13.122 --> 36:15.496
BEFORE I RISK EVERYTHING.

36:15.705 --> 36:17.871
I HAVE TO KNOW IF THERE
IS A CHANCE TO SAVE YOU.

36:23.663 --> 36:27.063
I'M NOT SURE THERE IS.

36:27.163 --> 36:28.688
SO YOU WON'T EVEN TRY?

36:28.788 --> 36:31.396
I WANT TO.

36:31.496 --> 36:32.497
BUT HE WON'T LET ME.
HE'S TOO STRONG.

36:33.497 --> 36:35.981
THEN I'LL TELL PHOEBE
THE TRUTH.

36:36.081 --> 36:38.231
I'LL CONVINCE HER
TO SAVE YOU.

36:38.331 --> 36:41.231
TO SAVE US.

36:41.331 --> 36:42.356
BUT IF YOU
CHANGE THE FUTURE,

36:42.456 --> 36:44.064
PHOEBE MIGHT DIE
SOONER AND SO MIGHT
HER SISTERS.

36:44.164 --> 36:46.647
MAGIC HAPPENS
FOR A REASON, COLE.

36:46.747 --> 36:49.939
I DON'T HAVE FAITH
IN MUCH ANYMORE,

36:50.039 --> 36:51.898
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT.

36:51.998 --> 36:53.998
I HAVE TO TRUST THAT I'M
MEANT TO CHANGE THIS.

36:54.415 --> 36:57.898
YOU THINK YOU'RE
MEANT TO SAVE ME?

36:57.998 --> 36:59.789
PHOEBE REMINDED ME
THAT I ONCE HAD HOPE...

37:01.373 --> 37:04.480
THAT WE HAD LOVE.

37:04.580 --> 37:06.289
THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS.

37:07.496 --> 37:09.998
TO KEEP HER FROM LIVING A LIFE
OF REGRET LIKE I LIVED.

37:17.456 --> 37:20.914
AH, I'M NOT INTRUDING,
AM I?

37:21.622 --> 37:23.748
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE LOST HIM!

37:25.332 --> 37:28.397
GUYS, GIVE ME A SECOND.

37:28.497 --> 37:30.040
HURRY, HE MIGHT
STILL BE IN THE AREA.

37:30.915 --> 37:31.497
HE'S AT THE HOUSE.

37:34.374 --> 37:36.497
WE'LL NEVER MAKE IT
BACK IN TIME.

37:37.249 --> 37:38.124
DON'T LOOK AT ME!

37:40.497 --> 37:41.523
WHY? YOU DID IT
THIS MORNING.

37:41.623 --> 37:43.190
BARELY. I WENT
DOWNSTAIRS...ALONE,

37:43.290 --> 37:45.607
NOT ACROSS TOWN
WITH 2 PASSENGERS.

37:45.707 --> 37:48.457
OK, WELL, PAIGE,
HE'LL KILL COLE.
WE HAVE TO TRY.

37:58.374 --> 38:01.497
HEY!

38:03.623 --> 38:06.915
HOHH!

38:10.416 --> 38:13.581
I'M OK. I'M OK.

38:15.791 --> 38:19.000
YAAHH!

38:34.749 --> 38:38.398
SPELL, SPELL, SPELL.
QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

38:38.498 --> 38:40.708
All: HELL THREW YOU
FROM ITS INNER CORE,

38:42.458 --> 38:44.150
BUT EARTH WON'T HOLD
YOU ANYMORE,

38:44.250 --> 38:45.441
SINCE HEAVEN
CANNOT BE YOUR PLACE,

38:45.541 --> 38:47.582
YOUR FLESH AND BLOOD
WE NOW ERASE.

38:49.499 --> 38:52.833
[SCREAMING]

39:01.541 --> 39:04.608
LEO!

39:04.708 --> 39:06.233
JUST HOLD ON.

39:06.333 --> 39:07.900
HOLD ON.

39:08.000 --> 39:08.984
SHE SAVED ME.

39:09.084 --> 39:11.167
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER.

39:20.167 --> 39:23.792
LEO, PLEASE.
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

39:34.499 --> 39:37.667
SHE'S GONE.

39:45.376 --> 39:48.400
WHAT HAPPENED?

39:48.500 --> 39:50.499
THE SPELL PLAYED OUT.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.499
YOU HEARD WHAT
YOU NEEDED TO HEAR.

39:58.792 --> 40:02.693
SPEAKING OF ORBING UP THERE,
WHEN DO I GET TO DO THAT?

40:02.793 --> 40:05.400
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE
IN SUCH A RUSH.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.484
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF
WHAT YOU ACCOMPLISHED.

40:07.584 --> 40:09.400
YOU SAVED THE DAY.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.526
I DIDN'T SAVE EVERYONE.

40:10.626 --> 40:12.152
NO, BUT THAT'S
THE GREAT THING
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

40:12.252 --> 40:14.484
THERE'S ALWAYS TIME
TO CHANGE IT.

40:14.584 --> 40:16.360
SO PHOEBE WON'T DIE
THAT WAY?

40:16.460 --> 40:17.902
NO. IF I KNOW PHOEBE,
AND I DO,

40:18.002 --> 40:20.776
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET
HER FUTURE TURN OUT
THAT WAY.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.360
GOOD. AND WHAT ABOUT
LITTLE PHOEBE?

40:23.460 --> 40:25.038
SHE WENT BACK TO HER TIME
WITH ALL THIS KNOWLEDGE
OF THE FUTURE.

40:25.048 --> 40:27.484
WON'T THAT CAUSE
COMPLICATIONS?

40:27.584 --> 40:29.400
I DOUBT IT.

40:29.500 --> 40:30.538
THE MINUTE SHE STARTS
TALKING ABOUT MAGIC,

40:30.548 --> 40:32.500
GRAMS WILL DO
SOME HOCUS-POCUS TO ERASE
ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE.

40:32.793 --> 40:36.027
THAT'S NICE.

40:36.127 --> 40:37.027
THAT'S GRAMS.

40:37.127 --> 40:38.235
WELL, EVERYTHING DONE,
I'M OFF TO BED.

40:38.335 --> 40:41.443
I HAVE A FUTURE OF MY OWN
TO CHANGE TOMORROW.

40:41.543 --> 40:43.500
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT TO DO
ABOUT YOUR PROMOTION?

40:45.002 --> 40:47.484
YEAH. I'M GONNA
TURN IT DOWN.

40:47.584 --> 40:49.401
HMM, WHAT CHANGED
YOUR MIND?

40:49.501 --> 40:51.235
THE 3 PHOEBES.
SHE USED MAGIC
TO CHANGE HER FUTURE,

40:51.335 --> 40:53.818
BUT I USED MAGIC
TO CHANGE SCOTT'S.

40:53.918 --> 40:55.861
AND THAT'S NOT SO FAIR.

40:55.961 --> 40:57.903
I DID THE RHYME,
I WILL DO THE TIME.

40:58.003 --> 41:01.128
GOOD NIGHT.

41:02.336 --> 41:06.236
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK
PHOEBE'S GONNA DO
ABOUT COLE?

41:06.336 --> 41:09.501
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I
DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WAIT 40 YEARS TO FIND OUT.

41:19.877 --> 41:23.211
[FOOTSTEPS]

41:25.128 --> 41:28.336
HI.

41:29.501 --> 41:32.502
I JUST, UM...

41:34.253 --> 41:37.401
HAD TO GET OUT
OF THE HOUSE?

41:37.501 --> 41:39.401
YEAH.

41:39.501 --> 41:40.736
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

41:40.836 --> 41:41.919
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU CAME BACK.

41:43.752 --> 41:45.044
YOU DIDN'T THINK I WOULD?

41:46.501 --> 41:47.919
I DON'T KNOW.
UM...

41:50.502 --> 41:53.628
I'VE BEEN...

41:54.586 --> 41:57.528
HAVING A LOT
OF CRAZY THOUGHTS
LATELY ABOUT US AND...

41:57.628 --> 42:01.503
I GUESS, I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE YOU WERE FEELING
THE SAME WAY, TOO.

42:04.502 --> 42:06.502
I NEVER TOLD YOU
WHY I CAST THAT SPELL,
DID I?

42:08.502 --> 42:11.070
I THOUGHT IT WAS TO HEAR
YOUR HEART'S DESIRE.

42:11.170 --> 42:13.628
IT WAS TO FIND OUT IF I
SHOULD MARRY YOU OR NOT.

42:13.795 --> 42:16.045
OH...

42:17.670 --> 42:18.421
AND?

42:20.837 --> 42:21.987
DO YOU STILL WANT TO?

42:22.087 --> 42:23.402
WELL, IT'S STILL A PART OF
MY PLANS, THAT'S FOR SURE.

42:23.502 --> 42:25.945
MINE, TOO.

42:26.045 --> 42:27.795
I-IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
STILL HAVE COLD FEET.

42:28.962 --> 42:33.045
IT'S JUST HEARING
MY PAST SELF REMIND ME
OF CINDERELLA...

42:35.337 --> 42:37.337
AND SEEING MY FUTURE SELF
WILLING TO...

42:40.462 --> 42:41.502
WILLING TO DIE FOR YOU...

42:43.838 --> 42:45.529
AND ME WILLING
TO DIE FOR YOU.

42:45.629 --> 42:48.155
I'M GONNA
ASK YOU A QUESTION,

42:48.255 --> 42:49.529
AND ALL I WANT IS
A STRAIGHT ANSWER, OK?

42:49.629 --> 42:52.946
CAN YOU DO THAT?

42:53.046 --> 42:54.821
OK. AHEM.

42:54.921 --> 42:56.671
IS THERE SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME?

42:58.255 --> 42:59.213
ABOUT YOU?

43:01.503 --> 43:02.796
SOMETHING THAT
I DON'T KNOW?

43:16.088 --> 43:19.255
NO.
