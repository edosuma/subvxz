[Children Chattering]

00:12.078 --> 00:14.774
- Hey. You sure I can't help?
- Absolutely not.

00:14.848 --> 00:17.908
- All set.
- Oh, Martha, you make this look so easy.

00:17.984 --> 00:21.681
- It's not too much, you think?
- Are you kidding?
This is just perfect.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.622
It's exactly the way
I always dreamt that Easter should be.

00:24.691 --> 00:28.559
- Mommy, look!
- Oh, good for you, Michelle.

00:28.628 --> 00:32.119
What you've done is really fabulous. The
kids are gonna remember this forever.

00:35.068 --> 00:38.333
[Martha] I hope there are
some things they won't remember.

00:38.405 --> 00:42.967
- What is she doing here?
- Her son is in Michelle's class,
Martha. Be nice.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.504
Jenny, hi.
It's good to see you.

00:48.581 --> 00:50.515

- [Gasps]

02:06.092 --> 02:08.026
She's shaken up, Howard.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.654
It took me two hours
to put her to bed.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.857
All I'm saying is...

02:12.932 --> 02:14.866
No, I didn't see any bird.

02:14.934 --> 02:18.665
But whatever it was, it scared her
and she wants to be with her daddy.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.468
That's all I'm saying.

02:21.541 --> 02:24.442
Well, can't you come home
one day early?

02:26.713 --> 02:29.204
All right, fine.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.216
I love you too.

04:22.661 --> 04:26.097
- Anything?
- No. She'll come.

04:26.164 --> 04:29.361
It's a matter of time.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.959
Well, I hope you realize
there's no evidence whatsoever...

04:32.037 --> 04:35.905
that this mystery woman
of yours has even committed a crime.

04:37.909 --> 04:40.469
Though her wardrobe
comes close.

04:40.545 --> 04:44.982
Ah. Six prostitutes
were seen with her at Dirty Dames,

04:45.050 --> 04:47.177
never to be seen again.

04:47.252 --> 04:50.619
Not only might she be a female
serial killer, rare in and of itself,

04:50.689 --> 04:53.852
but twice police raided
that club to arrest her.

04:53.925 --> 04:55.916
And twice they came up
empty-handed.

04:55.994 --> 05:00.761
She's on tape goin' in, the exits
are covered. She's nowhere to be found.

05:00.832 --> 05:03.494
What happens to her?
She disappeared? Turn invisible?

05:05.337 --> 05:09.034
Well, I hope we catch her
so she can tell us...

05:09.107 --> 05:11.371
before I have to spend
another night here.

05:11.443 --> 05:14.901
You know, Mulder, I don't know
about you, but I fnd this
all very depressing.

05:14.980 --> 05:19.747
This round-the-clock exposure
to the seamy underbelly.

05:19.818 --> 05:23.515
It's a job, Scully.
Vigilance in the face of privation.

05:23.588 --> 05:26.352
The sheer will that it takes
to sit in this crappy room...

05:26.424 --> 05:29.621
spying on the dregs of society
until our suspect surfaces.

05:31.463 --> 05:33.693
There is something
ennobling in that.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.757
[Cell Phone Ringing]

05:38.036 --> 05:39.970
Mulder.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.370
Now?

05:44.442 --> 05:46.376
All right. I gotta go.

05:47.979 --> 05:50.311

05:50.382 --> 05:53.317
- [Door Opens]
- [Scoffs]

06:03.695 --> 06:06.220
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yeah, sit down.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.434
Two weeks ago, a woman named
Martha Crittendon...

06:11.503 --> 06:13.835
disappeared from her home
in Bethany, Vermont.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.169
Local police haven't
turned up any sign of her.

06:16.241 --> 06:18.266
I'm hoping you may
be able to.

06:18.343 --> 06:20.607
- I'm already on a case.
- You're on a stakeout.

06:20.679 --> 06:22.840
I'm confident Agent Scully
can continue in your absence.

06:24.683 --> 06:27.277
Why? What did I do?

06:27.352 --> 06:30.549
There may be aspects
to this that...

06:30.622 --> 06:32.613
speak to your strengths
as an investigator.

06:34.426 --> 06:36.360
Specifically?

06:36.428 --> 06:39.022
Ravens.

06:40.398 --> 06:42.332
What do you know
about 'em...

06:42.400 --> 06:47.531
their mythological
or paranormal significance?

06:47.605 --> 06:50.267
Well, the, uh...

06:50.341 --> 06:55.244
the raven is considered
a very powerful symbol...

06:55.313 --> 06:58.441
in certain Norse, Celtic
and Native-American cultures.

06:58.516 --> 07:00.450
Mostly a negative one.

07:00.518 --> 07:04.318
Indians view it as a deceiving spirit.
Christianity mostly
associates it with evil.

07:04.389 --> 07:07.051
And then, of course,
there's Poe's Raven...

07:07.125 --> 07:09.889
and Nevermore
and all that stuff.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.656
Martha Crittendon's
seven-year-old daughter...

07:13.732 --> 07:17.566
claimed she was attacked by a raven
earlier the day her mother disappeared.

07:17.635 --> 07:21.366
Later, she heard one inside
the house before she discovered
her mother was missing.

07:21.439 --> 07:24.340
No, really,
what did I do?

07:24.409 --> 07:26.900
It's the only lead
that hasn't been explored.

07:26.978 --> 07:29.208
I wanna know if it has
any bearing on the case.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.340
I'm also assuming that the fact
that Martha Crittendon's father...

07:32.417 --> 07:35.386
is a federal judge also has
a little bearing on this case?

07:35.453 --> 07:39.822
It's been made clear to me that
locating her is my top priority.

07:39.891 --> 07:41.825
I'm making it yours as well.

07:53.471 --> 07:55.405
[Car Approaching]

08:03.748 --> 08:06.046
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

08:06.117 --> 08:09.052
Phil Adderly. Welcome to Bethany.
I appreciate the help.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.089
Sure. I don't know
how much help I'm gonna be.

08:12.157 --> 08:14.887
I know you had a lot of good
investigators on the case.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.689
- So, uh, you wanna just take
a quick look around?
- Great. Thanks.

08:17.762 --> 08:20.697
So tell me about
Martha Crittendon.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.427
Well, she and my wife Ellen,
they're best friends.

08:23.501 --> 08:25.992
Martha's much admired here.

08:26.070 --> 08:29.801
She's devoted to her family,
active in the community.

08:29.874 --> 08:33.332
I mean, needless to say,
the whole town is very concerned.

08:33.410 --> 08:37.211
- So, what's your theory
on what happened?
- I'm hopin' you'll tell me.

08:37.282 --> 08:40.945
There's no ransom note,
no prints or blood evidence.

08:41.019 --> 08:44.580
- Her husband was out of town
when she disappeared?
- In Miami at a conference.

08:44.656 --> 08:46.590
It checks out.

08:46.658 --> 08:49.923
Howard didn't have
anything to do with this.

08:58.536 --> 09:00.800
What do you know
about a raven?

09:01.906 --> 09:03.840
Yeah, yeah.
Michelle, their...

09:03.908 --> 09:06.138
their little girl
was saying something about that.

09:06.211 --> 09:08.202
Got me.

09:08.279 --> 09:10.213
Poor kid.

09:10.281 --> 09:13.512
- You wanna talk to her?
- Not necessary.

09:13.585 --> 09:17.077
You sure, uh, Martha's
last name isn't Stewart?

09:17.155 --> 09:20.818
Tell me about it. Last year this place
made the cover of New England Home.

09:27.632 --> 09:30.032
How many talons
would you say a raven had?

09:32.203 --> 09:34.137
Never mind.

09:42.313 --> 09:45.111
You know what this is?
Do you know what was hanging here?

09:45.183 --> 09:48.482
It was a mirror.
It was found broken.

09:48.553 --> 09:52.114
- You had no other signs of struggle?
- Not a one.

09:52.190 --> 09:55.853
- Does that mean somethin' to you?
- [Door Closes]

09:57.128 --> 09:59.995
Howard, this is Agent Mulder
with the F.B.I.

10:00.064 --> 10:02.032
Sir.
I hope we can help.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.967
I appreciate your coming.

10:05.036 --> 10:08.699
I'm wondering now... if this isn't
just a waste of your time.

10:08.773 --> 10:11.970
How so?

10:12.043 --> 10:14.136
With all the police
coming and going,

10:14.212 --> 10:16.442
this place is a wreck.

10:16.514 --> 10:20.041
I was straightening up
and I... found something.

10:23.054 --> 10:25.022
Uh, birth control pills.

10:25.089 --> 10:27.557
I think Martha was having
an affair.

10:30.662 --> 10:34.029
After Michelle, we decided
not to have more children.

10:34.098 --> 10:36.032
I had a vasectomy.

10:37.535 --> 10:42.165
They're in Martha's name.
She ordered them off the Internet.

10:42.240 --> 10:46.199
Because I guess
small towns talk.

10:48.279 --> 10:51.715
Of course, then I started
looking all around and I...

10:53.818 --> 10:56.252
found this in the pocket
of her favorite coat.

10:56.321 --> 10:58.755
I don't know what
this goes to...

10:58.823 --> 11:01.087
or what it means,
if anything.

11:01.159 --> 11:04.526
But the pills...

11:04.595 --> 11:07.120
Do you have any idea
who your wife may have been seeing?

11:07.198 --> 11:09.132
Whoever he is,

11:10.401 --> 11:12.961
Martha may be with him.

11:13.037 --> 11:15.369
It explains why
we haven't found her.

11:17.008 --> 11:20.307
She doesn't wanna be found.

11:44.235 --> 11:46.169
[Cawing]

11:51.876 --> 11:54.310
Cute kid.

11:54.379 --> 11:56.745
Oh, Jenny, you scared me.

11:58.082 --> 12:01.883
- You do those up yourself?
- Uh, yeah.

12:02.016 --> 12:05.144
I know Martha and you were good friends.
You must be pretty upset.

12:05.219 --> 12:07.813
Of course.
I'm sure we all are.

12:09.156 --> 12:12.284
Maybe you'd like some to put up
on your side of town.

12:12.360 --> 12:16.160
My side of town?

12:16.230 --> 12:20.860
- Yeah, sure.
- Look, I didn't mean that
the way it kind of sounded.

12:20.935 --> 12:25.599
No, it just naturally comes
out that way when you think
you're better than everyone.

12:25.673 --> 12:28.005
You and Martha
are two peas in a pod.

12:28.075 --> 12:30.839
Jenny, I don't think
I'm better than anyone.

12:30.912 --> 12:33.107
You and me got more
in common than you know.

12:41.756 --> 12:43.656
[Gasps]

12:51.866 --> 12:54.994
Yeah, right.

12:55.069 --> 12:57.867
Right. Thanks.

12:57.939 --> 13:00.874
Whoever Martha was seeing, the two of
them covered their tracks pretty good.

13:00.942 --> 13:05.538
Phone records don't show anything. You
think this person took her, harmed her?

13:05.613 --> 13:08.548
I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it.
According to your Audubon book,

13:08.616 --> 13:10.550
a raven has four talons.

13:10.618 --> 13:13.382
That matches the scratches
we found on Martha Crittendon's mantle.

13:13.454 --> 13:17.015
You're not saying a raven's the reason
Martha's gone missing?

13:17.091 --> 13:19.321
No, no, not a raven itself.

13:19.393 --> 13:22.453
But in folklore, ravens
are companions to evil...

13:22.530 --> 13:25.556
evil spirits, witches,
warlocks, that kind of thing.

13:25.633 --> 13:29.797
Agent Mulder,
I appreciate the different tact
you're taking on this investigation,

13:29.870 --> 13:31.895
but this whole bird thing?

13:31.973 --> 13:36.569
And keep in mind, you're basing this
on the word of a seven-year-old girl.

13:36.644 --> 13:40.603
Well, there was also a broken mirror
in Martha's house.

13:40.681 --> 13:43.514
Mirrors are considered
items of enchantment.

13:43.584 --> 13:45.814
A broken one...
means something.

13:45.886 --> 13:49.117
I'm not exactly sure what it is,
but... it means something.

13:49.190 --> 13:50.851
[Door Opens]

13:53.828 --> 13:55.989
Oh.

13:56.063 --> 13:58.327
- Hey, sweet girl.
- There's Papa.

13:58.399 --> 14:01.334
Agent Mulder, this is my
daughter Katie and my wife Ellen.

14:01.402 --> 14:04.132
- Nice to meet you.
- We're so glad you're here.
Look, our house is your house.

14:04.205 --> 14:07.197
- We have a spare room set up.
I'm sure you'll be comfortable.
- No, that's...

14:07.274 --> 14:11.040
There's no arguments. We're so grateful
that you're here to find Martha.

14:11.112 --> 14:13.273
It's the least we can do.

14:13.347 --> 14:15.281
Okay.

14:21.222 --> 14:24.089
I should really get the bureau
to reimburse you for room and board.

14:24.158 --> 14:28.185
- Don't be silly. This is just
a typical meal around here.
- Really?

14:28.262 --> 14:31.595
Bill works so much that supper is
usually the only time we see each other.

14:31.665 --> 14:35.499
- And I like to make it special.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

14:35.569 --> 14:37.662
[Groans]

14:37.738 --> 14:40.138
Excuse me.
Sorry.

14:40.207 --> 14:42.141
Thanks.

14:46.347 --> 14:49.612
- Mulder.
- Mulder, please tell me I can go home.

14:49.683 --> 14:51.742
Hey, Scully.
How's the stakeout?

14:51.819 --> 14:55.311
[Sighs] Well, the furnace broke
and I can just about see my breath.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.653
Ouch.
Sorry to hear that.

15:00.528 --> 15:04.589
That, and I've witnessed
a couple hundred things
I'd like to erase from my brain.

15:04.665 --> 15:06.633
Eeew.

15:06.700 --> 15:11.160
[Groans]
But as of yet, no mystery woman.

15:11.238 --> 15:14.207
Well, she'll come.
You know, it's just a matter of time.

15:14.275 --> 15:16.209
She'll show up.
I'm sure of that.

15:16.277 --> 15:18.507
Not before I die
of malnutrition.

15:18.579 --> 15:22.447
Scully, tough it out. Whatever doesn't
kill you, makes you stronger, right?

15:22.516 --> 15:25.815
- No, no. No capers. Thank you.
- I'm sorry. What?

15:25.886 --> 15:30.255
I said, "What a crazy caper." I'll talk
to you later. And keep warm. Bye.

15:34.995 --> 15:38.021
Did I hear you say something
about stakeout? What's the case?

15:38.099 --> 15:40.158
Sweetie,
this is family time.

15:40.234 --> 15:42.794
- Don't make our guest talk shop
at the dinner table.
- Fair enough.

15:45.106 --> 15:48.872
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.275
What's the matter,
sweetheart?

15:59.353 --> 16:01.287
I thought that
was your favorite.

16:01.355 --> 16:03.755
It tastes different
when Mommy makes it.

16:05.559 --> 16:08.323
Yeah.

16:08.395 --> 16:10.329
I know.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.134
How 'bout we go get hamburgers?

16:15.202 --> 16:18.035
Would you like that instead?

16:18.105 --> 16:20.665
[Wings Flapping]

16:20.741 --> 16:22.675
It's back.

16:31.152 --> 16:34.087
[Cawing]

16:37.491 --> 16:41.257
- Everything's all right, sweetheart.
I'll be right back.
- Okay.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.098
[Cawing]

17:16.096 --> 17:18.290
What do you make
of these claw marks?

17:18.365 --> 17:22.893
Well, one time I saw the victim of
a bear attack look something like that.

17:22.970 --> 17:26.428
Only bears don't plant
their kill in the rose garden.

17:26.507 --> 17:28.702
I was gonna say.

17:28.776 --> 17:31.939
The body's been around here for a while.
Probably since she went missing.

17:32.012 --> 17:34.606
[Phil]
What about your ravens?

17:34.682 --> 17:37.344
Howard said something
about ravens.

17:37.418 --> 17:40.615
Yeah.
Feedin' on her. See?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.900
You okay?

17:55.970 --> 17:58.700
I'm not arrestin' Howard.
I don't care how it looks.

17:58.772 --> 18:03.175
- Body buried in his own yard.
He didn't do this.
- I agree.

18:03.244 --> 18:06.543
[Phil]
The poor guy's suffered enough already.

18:10.751 --> 18:14.812
- What are you doing?
You shouldn't be here.
- What...

18:14.888 --> 18:16.719
Oh, my God.

18:16.790 --> 18:19.725
- Martha, no.
- Ellen, honey, I am so sorry.

18:19.793 --> 18:21.852
It can't be.

18:21.929 --> 18:23.760
[Phil]
It's okay. It's okay.

18:26.734 --> 18:29.760
The thing that did
that to her,

18:29.837 --> 18:32.738
I think I saw it today.

18:36.377 --> 18:39.869
I saw its reflection.

18:39.947 --> 18:43.906
It had a face out of a nightmare.
These long claws, the kind that could...

18:47.855 --> 18:52.019
The window shattered. I don't know how.
And when I turned around, it was gone.

18:52.092 --> 18:55.584
I don't know what I thought it was.
I didn't think it was real.
How could it be?

18:55.663 --> 18:57.631
But then when I saw
Martha's face...

18:57.698 --> 18:59.928
Honey, you've been
through a lot.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.560
You don't believe me.

19:04.038 --> 19:06.802
I do.

19:06.874 --> 19:10.605
You said the car window shattered
after you saw the reflection.

19:10.678 --> 19:13.306
And there's a broken mirror
in Martha's house.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.439
I don't think
that's a coincidence.

19:15.516 --> 19:19.077
- But what could it mean?
- Mirrors are considered doorways.

19:19.153 --> 19:23.647
In the Victorian era, they built
mirrored rooms called "psychomantiums,"

19:23.724 --> 19:28.093
where they thought they could summon
forth spirits from the spirit world.

19:28.162 --> 19:31.131
Denizens from the spirit world
were brought into this world.

19:31.198 --> 19:33.166
"Denizens of the spirit world?"

19:33.233 --> 19:36.225
You asked about the raven.
The raven is a carrion bird...

19:36.303 --> 19:38.237
attracted to death
and decay.

19:38.305 --> 19:41.365
What if... this entity
that you saw...

19:41.442 --> 19:43.842
is somehow a personification
of that?

19:43.911 --> 19:47.745
What if this creature was brought forth
in order to attack Martha?

19:47.815 --> 19:50.306
Then the question becomes
who summoned it forth.

19:52.319 --> 19:55.686
Ellen, do you know if Martha
had any enemies?

19:55.756 --> 19:58.816
Can you think of anyone at all
who would have wished her harm?

20:03.762 --> 20:06.322
I sure as hell didn't
have anything to do with it.

20:06.398 --> 20:09.526
They're just routine questions,
Miss Uphouse. Answer 'em
and we'll be out of here.

20:11.337 --> 20:13.931
We understand there was no love lost
between you and Martha Crittendon.

20:14.006 --> 20:17.032
And where do you
understand that from?

20:18.577 --> 20:22.638
- Mrs. Sheriff, right?
- It's not exactly a town secret.

20:22.715 --> 20:25.775
Right. Like there aren't
enough of those already.

20:27.152 --> 20:31.179
Queen Martha and her perfect
little Easter egg hunts.

20:31.256 --> 20:34.248
[Scoffs]
She's so above the rest of us.

20:34.326 --> 20:36.886
Except I heard she was
steppin' out on her husband,

20:36.962 --> 20:40.193
knockin'boots
with who knows who.

20:40.265 --> 20:44.224
I'm not happy she's dead and all.
But you need to look into that.

20:44.303 --> 20:48.831
Well, let's stay on the subject of you...
on your police record, for instance.

20:48.907 --> 20:51.341
You don't suffer people
that don't give you respect.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.640
I'm thinking of that hair
salon owner you assaulted.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.806
That was forever ago.
And I paid for that.

20:56.882 --> 20:59.077
And I had nothing
to do with Martha.

20:59.151 --> 21:02.143
Where were you the night
she disappeared?

21:03.288 --> 21:06.086
At home, all night.

21:07.993 --> 21:10.257
I gotta get back to work.

21:10.329 --> 21:13.787
I don't know about you,
but I believe her.

21:13.866 --> 21:16.027
She didn't do it.
I just don't get that vibe.

21:16.101 --> 21:19.229
Fair enough. But why did
she lie about her alibi?

21:20.639 --> 21:22.903
I got that vibe pretty clear.

21:26.178 --> 21:28.578
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- Excuse me.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.581
I'll be in the car.

21:32.751 --> 21:34.685
Mulder.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.380
Mulder, when you
find me dead,

21:36.455 --> 21:38.787
my desicated corpse
propped up...

21:38.857 --> 21:40.984
staring lifelessly
through the telescope...

21:41.060 --> 21:44.518
at drunken frat boys peeing
and vomiting into the gutter,

21:44.596 --> 21:47.531
just know that my last thoughts
were of you...

21:47.599 --> 21:49.624
and how I'd like to kill you.

21:49.702 --> 21:52.034
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

21:52.104 --> 21:54.834
It's a freak show, Mulder.

21:54.907 --> 21:58.900
It's a nonstop parade
of every single lowlife imaginable.

21:58.977 --> 22:02.242
The view may not be too different here.
It's dressed up nicer,

22:02.314 --> 22:05.511
but underneath the surface
it's the same seamy underbelly.

22:05.584 --> 22:07.518
It's not the same.
Trust me.

22:07.586 --> 22:11.022
You know, Scully, this case
has turned out to be a little
more interesting than I thought.

22:11.090 --> 22:14.582
- And I could use your help.
- You talking about a reprieve for me?

22:14.660 --> 22:18.721
Well, there's a murder victim I'd like
you to autopsy. What do you think?

22:20.466 --> 22:24.493
Scully, you still there?
Hello?

22:24.570 --> 22:27.471
- That van is back.
- What'd you say?

22:27.539 --> 22:31.635
- Nothing, Mulder.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
- [Phone Beeps Off]

23:28.433 --> 23:31.300

[Gasps]

23:32.371 --> 23:34.566
Get away from her!

23:34.640 --> 23:37.871
- It's okay, hon. Come on.
- [Caws]

23:39.044 --> 23:41.979
[Screams, Panting]

23:48.854 --> 23:51.516
Be quiet now.
Shh.

23:51.590 --> 23:54.184
Hush. Be quiet.

[Whimpering]

24:09.908 --> 24:13.036
Oh, God. Ellen?

24:14.112 --> 24:16.103
Ellen, what happened?

24:39.371 --> 24:41.635
[Cooing]

24:44.910 --> 24:47.140
Are you feeling
a little better, Ellen?

24:49.381 --> 24:53.579
Can you... just talk to me
a little bit about what happened?

24:55.387 --> 24:57.321
It came back.

24:57.389 --> 24:59.914
It came back?
The... The creature you saw?

25:02.828 --> 25:05.592
It was here, Phil.
It chased me.

25:05.664 --> 25:07.825
It's all right, honey.

25:18.844 --> 25:22.177
Please don't encourage this.
This is not what she needs.

25:22.247 --> 25:25.341
- I believe she saw something.
- And I believe she didn't.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.510
Her best friend just died,
for God's sake.

25:27.586 --> 25:31.613
These imaginings of hers
are brought on by stress.

25:31.690 --> 25:35.990
I have been through the entire house
and I didn't see any indication
anyone else was here.

25:36.061 --> 25:39.497
- What about the two broken mirrors?
- What about them?

25:39.564 --> 25:43.933
You think broken mirrors have
some deeper meaning, but you
still can't tell me what it is.

25:44.002 --> 25:48.132
And in this case,
I'm thinking Ellen broke 'em herself.

25:49.608 --> 25:52.202
What?

26:00.585 --> 26:04.885
It's number six. It's a match
to the one Howard Crittendon
found in his wife's coat pocket.

26:06.224 --> 26:09.489
- What would this be doing here?
- I don't know.

26:21.373 --> 26:24.638
Ellen, do you recognize
this key?

26:26.178 --> 26:28.908
Oh, I was...
sweeping the floor...

26:28.981 --> 26:31.711
and it got caught up
in the sweeper.

26:32.784 --> 26:35.844
I never saw it before today.

26:35.921 --> 26:38.549
You found it before
you were attacked?

26:40.792 --> 26:43.386
Right before.

26:43.462 --> 26:46.590
Right before I saw the raven.

26:46.665 --> 26:50.431
Let me see if my department can run this
down and find out what lock it goes to.

28:07.644 --> 28:10.112
Hey, I can't do this anymore.

28:12.616 --> 28:14.675
- Can't, huh?
- No.

28:14.751 --> 28:18.050
- We gotta stop.
- Well, that's too bad.

29:04.134 --> 29:06.102
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning, Ellen.

29:06.169 --> 29:08.569
Wow.
[Chuckles]

29:08.638 --> 29:11.072
- Have you seen my shirt?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

29:11.141 --> 29:13.075
- I left it...
- It's over here.

29:16.780 --> 29:19.408
Oh, Ellen, you didn't
have to go to the trouble.

29:19.482 --> 29:22.713
No, it's no trouble.
Actually, it helps me.

29:22.786 --> 29:25.880
Whenever my life's a mess,
I just do some housework.

29:25.956 --> 29:28.356
Gives me the illusion
I'm in control.

29:28.425 --> 29:32.293
- Well, maybe I should try that sometime.
- Have a seat.

29:32.362 --> 29:34.296
Thanks.

29:35.966 --> 29:38.696
Yikes. Wow.

29:38.768 --> 29:40.793
It's just Phil's
breakfast times two.

29:40.870 --> 29:43.862
Well, Phil is living large.
Where is he this morning?

29:43.940 --> 29:46.704
Uh, probably out on a call.

29:46.776 --> 29:48.903
He'll be back.
You... You just dig in.

29:59.456 --> 30:01.617
- Whoa. Ow.
- Sorry.

30:01.691 --> 30:05.127
- Do you need milk?
- Mm-mm. I'm fine.

30:05.195 --> 30:07.993
I get the feeling you're not
used to anyone taking care of you.

30:08.064 --> 30:11.966
Well, that has a...
a vaguely pathetic ring to it.

30:12.035 --> 30:14.936
No, I just meant
I didn't notice a wedding band.

30:15.005 --> 30:17.496
- Oh.
- Do you have a significant other?

30:17.574 --> 30:22.602
Um, not in the widely
understood definition of that term.

30:22.679 --> 30:26.615
Oh. Well, the right woman
will come along and change all that.

you must see in your work...

- Sorry I'm late. Paperwork.

- Good morning, Agent Mulder.
- Good morning.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.975
I'm gonna go
check on Katie.

31:00.216 --> 31:02.207
You sleep well?

31:02.285 --> 31:05.652
I only woke up once,
when you went out.

31:05.722 --> 31:09.590
Well, I'll try to be
quieter next time.

31:09.659 --> 31:12.253
We've got a deputy out.
We're shorthanded.

31:12.328 --> 31:14.319
I had to take some calls.

31:14.397 --> 31:18.390
- All night?
- Yeah. We were busy.

31:20.904 --> 31:22.929
I spoke to the coroner
this morning.

31:23.006 --> 31:26.567
The autopsy shows Martha Crittendon
was four weeks pregnant when she died,

31:26.643 --> 31:29.305
despite her birth control pills.

31:29.379 --> 31:33.008
Probably didn't even know it.
Any idea who the father might be?

31:35.118 --> 31:40.351
I mean, Howard's vasectomy
pretty much puts him out of the running.

31:43.893 --> 31:45.884
Any inkling who it might be?

31:48.698 --> 31:51.030
Just say what's
on your mind, Agent.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.631
You have a piece of evidence
in your possession that I'd like back.

31:56.706 --> 32:00.073
The skeleton key.
Number six.

32:13.256 --> 32:16.054
You wanna tell me
what this unlocks?

32:17.761 --> 32:20.355
Once I find out,
we'll talk again.

32:24.701 --> 32:26.965

real soon.

a double shift.

No, no, no, don't eat
a lot of cookies. No.

have oatmeal in them.

Sheriff, you know that talk
I said we should have?

34:41.471 --> 34:43.405
I left her sleeping.

34:45.742 --> 34:48.734
So, you were having an affair
with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon?

34:50.679 --> 34:54.241
I gotta hand it to you, Sheriff.
You put the service back
in the "protect and serve."

34:54.317 --> 34:57.252
I cared about both of them.

34:57.320 --> 34:59.254
They knew about
each other?

35:01.457 --> 35:03.516
But I'm assuming
Ellen doesn't?

35:03.593 --> 35:05.527
No.

35:05.595 --> 35:08.393
But even if she did,
she'd find a way to rationalize it.

35:10.033 --> 35:11.967
I'm not defending myself,

35:12.035 --> 35:15.562
but... two years ago
I wanted a divorce.

35:15.638 --> 35:17.902

35:17.974 --> 35:21.410

facing you right now.

the broken mirrors and the raven?

did this. Don't you still believe that?

I said it was an entity
summoned by somebody else.

is that possible?

I think this sleepy
little girl needs a nap.

36:26.776 --> 36:29.711
I do.
[Muttering]

36:39.655 --> 36:41.782
I love you.

36:41.858 --> 36:44.793
Go to sleep now.
Okay, baby?

37:30.937 --> 37:32.871
Ellen?

37:37.511 --> 37:39.445
Ellen?

37:42.783 --> 37:45.149
[Cell Phone Ringing]

37:46.253 --> 37:48.187
Mulder.

37:48.255 --> 37:52.191
- Mulder, I am free.
- You're free?

37:52.259 --> 37:55.490
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna go home,
take a shower for,

37:55.562 --> 37:57.496
I don't know,
eight or nine hours,

37:57.564 --> 38:02.092
burn the clothes that I'm wearing
and then sleep until late spring.

38:02.169 --> 38:04.364
- You solved the X-File.
- Yes.

38:04.438 --> 38:06.429
Except it's not
an X-File, Mulder.

38:06.506 --> 38:09.441
What are you saying? You didn't catch
our blond mystery serial killer?

38:09.509 --> 38:11.443
Oh, no, we caught her.

38:11.511 --> 38:15.140
But, uh, she isn't
a serial killer.

38:16.383 --> 38:18.874
Nor is she a blond.

38:18.952 --> 38:22.786
And she isn't even a she.

38:22.856 --> 38:24.653
What are you talking about?

38:26.460 --> 38:30.419
What I'm talking about is these six
missing prostitutes aren't dead, Mulder.

38:30.497 --> 38:32.931
They are alive and well
in a halfway house...

38:32.999 --> 38:34.990
that was set up
by this mystery blond...

38:35.068 --> 38:38.799
who happens to go by the name
of Mark Scott Eggbert.

38:38.872 --> 38:42.535
And Mr. Eggbert wishes
to acquaint lost souls...

38:42.609 --> 38:45.669
with the teachings of Christ.

38:45.745 --> 38:47.713
And that's his hook, I guess.

38:47.781 --> 38:50.477
He dresses up like
a fellow prostitute...

38:50.550 --> 38:53.348
to make the girls
feel at ease.

38:53.420 --> 38:57.220
But this vanishing act
is no more paranormal...

38:57.290 --> 38:59.690
than a change of wardrobe, Mulder.

38:59.759 --> 39:03.991
He goes into a place like a woman
and comes out as a man.

39:04.064 --> 39:06.032
- Right under...
- Our noses.

39:06.099 --> 39:09.694
Exactly.
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

39:09.769 --> 39:12.829
Or I guess in this case,
a sheep in wolf's clothing.

39:12.906 --> 39:15.704
Well, good work, Scully.
I'll call you back later.

39:28.321 --> 39:30.255
Ellen?

39:32.592 --> 39:35.857
- Ellen, it's Agent Mulder.
- Please go away.

39:37.197 --> 39:40.132
Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead.

39:40.200 --> 39:43.863
Your husband is in custody
suspected of murdering her,
only I don't think he did it.

39:43.937 --> 39:45.871
Do you?

39:47.174 --> 39:50.701
Ellen, you went out...
this morning after breakfast.

39:50.777 --> 39:52.870
Where'd you go?

39:52.946 --> 39:56.006
It's not me.
It can't be.

39:56.082 --> 39:58.141
I think it is.

39:58.218 --> 40:02.951
Ellen, I think you have a whole
other side that you're afraid to face.

40:03.023 --> 40:05.548
That would explain
all the broken mirrors.

40:05.625 --> 40:09.288
You don't want to see yourself
for what you really are.

40:09.362 --> 40:11.922
Ellen, you have to
come out of there.

40:11.998 --> 40:15.866
Then what?
[Crying]

40:15.936 --> 40:18.200
My marriage, my life?

40:18.271 --> 40:21.434
Everything I thought I had...

40:21.508 --> 40:24.136
is nothing.

40:24.211 --> 40:26.475
It's all lies.

40:29.482 --> 40:32.007
I wish you'd never come here.

40:32.085 --> 40:34.246
Ellen, you need
to open this door.

40:42.395 --> 40:44.158
[Roaring]

41:13.526 --> 41:15.289
[Gasps]

41:22.002 --> 41:24.436
[Spitting]

41:30.644 --> 41:33.579
[Whimpering]

41:58.171 --> 42:00.105
[Door Buzzer Sounding]

42:08.248 --> 42:10.182
You wanna see her?

42:11.284 --> 42:13.218
Does she wanna see me?

42:16.923 --> 42:20.757
The doctors say she's got
some kind of dissociative disorder.

42:20.827 --> 42:22.761
A split personality.

42:23.997 --> 42:26.227
That doesn't explain
what happened, does it?

42:26.299 --> 42:30.395
I think it's about as close
as science can come.
I think the basic idea's right.

42:30.470 --> 42:33.564
There's some multiple
personality disorders...

42:33.640 --> 42:37.201
where an alternate personality displays
traits that the host doesn't have,

42:37.277 --> 42:41.737
like nearsightedness
or high blood pressure or even diabetes.

42:41.815 --> 42:46.377
I think in Ellen's case, the... changes
were just a lot more extreme.

42:46.453 --> 42:48.944
Like... Jekyl and Hyde?

42:49.022 --> 42:51.786
She wanted so much
from her life with you.

42:51.858 --> 42:54.224
A perfect life.

42:54.294 --> 42:58.025
And I think that at some point
she found out you were cheating
with Jenny and Martha.

42:58.098 --> 43:00.828
I don't know when,
but at some point she did.

43:00.900 --> 43:03.391
Like you said, I think
she had to rationalize that.

43:03.470 --> 43:06.462
And she just bottled up
her anger.

43:06.539 --> 43:09.167
Swallowed it, and it
had to come out some way.

43:09.242 --> 43:11.642
I think she did what she did
to protect her family.

43:27.394 --> 43:29.328
[Cawing]

43:39.372 --> 43:41.306
[Cawing Continues]

44:20.778 --> 44:22.780
[Child]
I made this!
