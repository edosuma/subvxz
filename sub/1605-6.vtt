A colleague of mine e-mailed
that to me this morning.

01:21.071 --> 01:24.575
Apparently it was posted
on PrisonPoon.com,

01:24.658 --> 01:26.744
labeled as
"Litchfield Poonanny."

01:26.951 --> 01:31.206
Does your colleague often
browse PrisonPoon.com?

01:31.289 --> 01:33.584
I would like to solve
this problem

01:33.709 --> 01:35.753
before the warden
finds out about it, Joe.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.638
Neither of us wants to
see what happens if he,

01:37.671 --> 01:40.006
or, God forbid, the press,
get a hold of this.

01:40.131 --> 01:46.012
Forgive me for questioning the no doubt
pristine reputation of Prison Poon,

01:46.096 --> 01:49.266
but how do we know for sure
it came out of here?

01:49.433 --> 01:51.017
Notice the tile?

01:51.560 --> 01:54.479
Either one of your inmates has a cell phone...
There's no way.

01:54.605 --> 01:57.232
My guys tore the bunks apart
looking for the screwdriver.

01:57.315 --> 02:00.611
Then it's a CO. And he's taking
beaver shots of inmates.

02:00.736 --> 02:02.070
So much better.

02:02.153 --> 02:05.115
The warden'll love that almost as
much as he loves a dick in the ass.

02:06.283 --> 02:08.744
Well, what the warden does
with his free time...

02:12.664 --> 02:15.626
I will get to the bottom
of this, ma'am.

02:15.709 --> 02:16.710
I hope so.

02:16.794 --> 02:20.422
It is so depressing dealing with
a man who makes less than 40 K.

02:20.505 --> 02:23.801
I was really hoping to get
you above that this year.

02:38.482 --> 02:39.817
Are you back on carbs?

02:39.942 --> 02:44.195
My gut's all fucked up from my cheat
day, so I'm sticking to soft foods.

02:44.738 --> 02:46.865
Got some Go-Gurt
in the fridge for lunch.

which my Buddhist
faith requires.

03:08.303 --> 03:09.346
(PANTING) Mr. Healy,

03:09.471 --> 03:12.223

time praising the Lord

03:12.349 --> 03:14.518
in front of all these
heathens and sinners.

03:14.643 --> 03:16.854
We need our chapel.
It's our God-given right.

03:17.061 --> 03:20.482
Hey, Mr. Healy, would you
take a look at this?

03:20.649 --> 03:22.442
I think it might be the flu.

03:36.206 --> 03:40.711
Mr. Healy, them cracker meth-head bitches
won't let us change the channel.

03:40.794 --> 03:45.089
And it's our turn! I can't watch
no more Toddlers and Tiaras.

03:45.716 --> 03:48.886
Don't you triviatize.
This shit is serious.

03:49.011 --> 03:51.221
I won't support the
sexuation of baby girls.

03:51.304 --> 03:53.056
That's some nasty shit,

03:53.139 --> 03:55.851
even if some of they sequin
dresses do be on point.

03:58.311 --> 04:00.564
You into some dirty
shit, Mr. Healy?

04:02.065 --> 04:05.235
Fine! You have control of the

your hair these days?

04:31.762 --> 04:33.764
Oh, really, Mom?
Every time?

04:33.847 --> 04:35.057
Don't be mopey.

04:35.139 --> 04:37.601
Polly had the most darling
French braid yesterday.

04:37.684 --> 04:38.727
You saw Polly?

04:38.810 --> 04:41.312
Yes. I dropped by
with a baby present.

04:41.438 --> 04:43.607
She told me about your
little chicken incident.

04:43.732 --> 04:44.772
Is that what she called it?

04:44.816 --> 04:48.070
It's none of my business, but I
think you owe her an apology.

04:48.152 --> 04:50.280
I have been trying
to apologize!

04:50.405 --> 04:51.615
Keep it down, Chapman!

04:53.450 --> 04:54.451
(WHISPERS) Oh, my.

04:56.327 --> 04:59.873
I have been calling her. A lot.
But she won't answer the phone.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.296
I need you to be
very honest with me.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.173
Are you losing it in here?

05:09.299 --> 05:13.720
Because we're very worried about you.
There are medications.

05:13.929 --> 05:15.513
I am not going crazy.

05:15.639 --> 05:17.474
I am surrounded by crazy,

05:17.557 --> 05:21.394
and I am trying to climb
Everest in flip-flops,

05:21.478 --> 05:23.814
but I am not going crazy, okay?

05:24.355 --> 05:27.233
Honey, nobody would blame you.
Look at this place.

05:27.692 --> 05:29.151
You're incarcerated.

05:30.862 --> 05:34.992
God only knows the emotional toll it
must take to be in here with that woman.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.702
She is the least
of my problems.

05:37.828 --> 05:40.204
She's your entire
problem, Piper.

05:40.664 --> 05:43.583
You'd be home trying on wedding
dresses, growing your business,

05:43.667 --> 05:47.462
giving me grandchildren,
if it weren't for her.

05:48.005 --> 05:50.090
She stole all that from you.

05:50.172 --> 05:51.257
Mom.

05:51.341 --> 05:52.509
Yes.

05:52.634 --> 05:54.344
I need you to hear
what I'm gonna say.

05:54.469 --> 05:56.178
I need you to really hear it.

05:59.181 --> 06:00.934
I am in here

06:01.852 --> 06:05.814
because I am no different
from anybody else in here.

06:05.897 --> 06:07.273
(SCOFFS)

06:08.399 --> 06:10.152
I made bad choices.

06:11.069 --> 06:13.195
I committed a crime.

06:13.321 --> 06:16.366
And being in here
is no one's fault

06:17.909 --> 06:19.077

had done...

06:26.208 --> 06:28.545

is Howard.

06:30.172 --> 06:33.925
You never would have ended up
in here if you'd gone to trial.

Sweetheart, you're nothing
like any of these women.

06:41.223 --> 06:44.561

would have seen that.

07:38.406 --> 07:39.616
You don't think so?

I prefer to be in denial
about the shared genetics.

a lot of things, blondie.

waiting for somebody?

07:53.713 --> 07:57.050
Nah. Wouldn't want to ruin
my four-month dry spell.

07:57.134 --> 07:59.886

to sound appealing.

crap like that around here.

from a dirty needle.

08:58.361 --> 09:00.697
They also found traces
of cocaine in your blood,

09:00.822 --> 09:03.158
which is a fun
new choice for you.

09:03.533 --> 09:05.118
I had pneumonia.

09:05.202 --> 09:06.828
It must've spread or something.

09:09.706 --> 09:11.208
Seriously, I'm clean.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.918
Ironically enough, you are now.

09:14.044 --> 09:16.379
You had several blood
transfusions during the surgery.

09:24.054 --> 09:26.931
Must have been a pretty
bad case of pneumonia.

this angry, I-hate-Mom phase?

Oh, you're my mom!

brown woman who made me pancakes

09:47.118 --> 09:48.558
and read me
Charlotte's Web at night.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.747
I did what was good for you.

09:50.830 --> 09:53.457
Living with a nanny while you lived in
a separate apartment with that prick

09:53.583 --> 09:56.460
who thought children carried germs?
That's for my own good?

09:56.586 --> 09:59.881
I think if you take a second and
look at our current situation,

09:59.964 --> 10:01.132
you might reconsider.

10:01.258 --> 10:04.052
Do you know what? Keep blaming
everyone but yourself, Nicole.

10:04.135 --> 10:06.596
Seems to be working out
really well for you so far.

10:06.721 --> 10:09.266
I always miss you
until you're here.

10:10.767 --> 10:15.021
Then I realize the mom I miss must've
been someone I invented when I was a kid.

I don't know what more
you want from me.

26:19.400 --> 26:20.527
Oh, come on in, Chapman.

26:22.487 --> 26:23.613
Please close the door.

26:41.590 --> 26:43.717
What? Do you...

26:43.926 --> 26:45.052
Hold up the red one.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.311
Okay, now the blue.

26:54.937 --> 26:56.272
WOMAN: Mail call
in 15 minutes.

26:57.314 --> 26:59.942
WOMAN: Cart will be making
the rounds in 15 minutes.

27:01.442 --> 27:02.443
Mr. Healy...

27:02.527 --> 27:05.697
It's for my wife.
It's our anniversary tomorrow.

27:05.781 --> 27:09.076
I think the blue
is better. Thanks.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.537
Have a seat, Chapman.

27:17.793 --> 27:20.712
Chapman, we understand
each other, don't we?

27:22.298 --> 27:23.673
I think so.

27:24.007 --> 27:25.092
I mean, I agree.

27:25.175 --> 27:27.052
I think the two of us
working together,

27:27.803 --> 27:29.679
we could really turn
some things around.

27:29.805 --> 27:32.224
Or at the very least, make
things a little quieter.

27:38.521 --> 27:39.940
You want me to run for WAC.

27:40.816 --> 27:43.819
We don't get ladies as bright
as yourself in here often.

27:43.902 --> 27:47.488
Thank you, Mr. Healy. I appreciate that.
I really do.

27:47.572 --> 27:51.327
But I'm trying this new thing where
I stay out of the spotlight.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.787
I feel... I think that
it's a better bet for me.

27:53.870 --> 27:58.125
I'm giving you a chance to
make your time count, Chapman.

27:58.541 --> 28:03.380
Thank you. But I need
to politely decline.

28:03.504 --> 28:07.259
Well, I'm disappointed.

28:07.343 --> 28:10.220
It's certainly not like I can
force you to run anyway, right?

28:13.140 --> 28:15.516
We're not Cosmo, Larry.

28:15.642 --> 28:17.936
We don't do pieces on
having better orgasms.

28:18.020 --> 28:22.316
And, truthfully, "edging" sounds like
a recipe for blue balls. It's just...

28:22.732 --> 28:24.026
It is gross.

28:24.109 --> 28:26.611
Look, what if I change
the angle? Maybe...

28:26.695 --> 28:29.656
What's the deal with your wife?
Is she really in prison?

28:31.367 --> 28:33.869
My fiancee. She is.
It sucks.

28:33.994 --> 28:37.706
Look, um, I really think
if I made some changes...

28:37.831 --> 28:39.871
Christ, Bloom. No one wants
to learn how not to come.

28:39.916 --> 28:41.293
Coming is the whole
goddamn point.

28:41.377 --> 28:42.544
Listen, I've got to
get to this meeting.

28:42.627 --> 28:45.839
But this is a good story, okay?
Come on, Tim.

28:47.049 --> 28:50.760
I need this. Just give me something, huh?
An assignment.

28:51.594 --> 28:52.762
You want an
assignment? Fine.

28:52.888 --> 28:54.764
Here's your assignment,
"My wife is in prison."

28:54.890 --> 28:56.016
Fiancee.

28:56.099 --> 28:58.894
She takes naked showers
with bad, busty women,

28:58.977 --> 29:01.480
and I'm home alone thinking
about it, trying not to come.

29:01.563 --> 29:03.565
That's a story for us.
Knock yourself out.

29:07.528 --> 29:10.613
It's too far!
A little to the right.

29:11.073 --> 29:13.409
Ain't we learned our lesson
about hanging crosses, Tucky?

29:13.534 --> 29:16.537
Ain't we learned our lesson
about mouthing off? Get...

29:16.619 --> 29:17.913
Sorry.

29:19.748 --> 29:20.916
You keep this up,

29:21.041 --> 29:23.210
and God's gonna start
questioning your devotion.

29:23.293 --> 29:24.503
He told me.

29:28.673 --> 29:31.843
"Died for your sins."
Who's gonna win?

29:31.927 --> 29:33.429
Tiffany.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.013
(CHUCKLES)

29:35.097 --> 29:37.015
Man, those little white
midgets are sad,

29:37.099 --> 29:38.434
but them bitches
know how to win!

29:38.517 --> 29:41.437
(CHUCKLES) Look at you,
all power hungry and shit.

29:41.520 --> 29:43.980
Where are your morals,
Candidate Jefferson?

29:44.106 --> 29:45.357
Well, Mackenzie...

29:45.441 --> 29:46.775
(BOTH LAUGHING)

29:53.615 --> 29:55.200
This fucking election.

29:55.284 --> 29:57.244
Like this place needs to be
any more like high school!

29:57.327 --> 29:59.913
My God, I'm drowning
in vowels over here.

30:06.295 --> 30:07.504
This the campaign strategy?

30:07.629 --> 30:10.466
No, it's more like
a life strategy.

30:10.591 --> 30:12.134
Everyone likes to get fed.

30:12.217 --> 30:15.220
Come on. Come on! Come on.
(CHUCKLES) That's gross.

30:17.013 --> 30:19.475
Come on!
It's delicious!

30:20.934 --> 30:22.311
Speaking of high school...

30:22.394 --> 30:24.062
I feel like such an asshole.

30:24.146 --> 30:25.730
Why won't she even look at me?

30:25.814 --> 30:28.900
'Cause you were an asshole.
Everyone has their limits.

30:29.151 --> 30:32.070
Okay, 32, 33...

30:32.154 --> 30:33.530
Whoa.
Thirty-four points!

30:33.655 --> 30:35.324
Bam! (CHUCKLES)

30:36.241 --> 30:39.411
Look, you know her better than
I do, but in my experience,

30:39.495 --> 30:41.163
she can smell bullshit
like a shark smells blood.

30:41.288 --> 30:43.332
Just cut out the needy puppy
act and be straight with her.

30:43.457 --> 30:45.125
Say you're sorry
for being a dick.

30:45.708 --> 30:49.796
What about, like, a snappy kind of slogan?
Something with rhymes in it?

30:50.631 --> 30:53.967
What about, "Vote for Morello because
she's not yellow, she's white"?

30:54.050 --> 30:55.051

31:00.516 --> 31:02.100

31:03.852 --> 31:05.687
Mmm! Oh, that's good.

31:07.022 --> 31:08.023
It's a party!

31:08.148 --> 31:10.984
I feel like I'm playing house.

31:11.193 --> 31:13.862
(CHUCKLES) You wanna
play doctor instead?

31:13.987 --> 31:15.405
POLLY: This place
is insane.

31:16.365 --> 31:18.074
Cheers.
Cheers.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.202
Great to meet you, Holly.

31:22.037 --> 31:24.039
It's Polly, actually.

31:24.914 --> 31:27.709
Right. Polly Hobbie.

31:35.551 --> 31:39.095
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I have to go play hostess.

31:42.516 --> 31:43.892
She's better in smaller groups.

31:43.975 --> 31:45.352
Think she'll remember
my name then?

31:45.435 --> 31:47.770
Are you being pissy
because I'm seeing a woman?

31:47.896 --> 31:50.190
I'm pissy because
you're seeing an asshole.

31:50.273 --> 31:52.901
I think you're overreacting
a little bit, Molly.

31:54.027 --> 31:55.404
There's a weird energy in here.

31:55.529 --> 31:58.073
Not to mention she's loaded
and she's, what, like, 30?

31:58.198 --> 31:59.324
Trust fund?

31:59.408 --> 32:01.368
No, she imports things.

32:01.451 --> 32:05.414
I can't believe you're giving me shit for this.
You dated your teacher.

32:05.497 --> 32:07.082
Adjunct professor.

32:07.583 --> 32:12.045
I really like her.

32:12.921 --> 32:14.631
Do you like her or her things?

32:14.715 --> 32:16.925
Oh, I get it. You're
feeling threatened.

32:17.050 --> 32:19.636
Oh, Jesus. Fuck off. I'm
just looking out for you.

32:19.761 --> 32:22.472
Well, don't. I'm happy.

32:22.598 --> 32:25.684
Well, then don't expect me to be
there when you're not happy anymore.

32:25.767 --> 32:30.105
Okay, I won't expect that. But you will be.
Because you love me.

32:30.188 --> 32:32.399
Of course I do,
you stupid lesbian.

32:32.482 --> 32:33.900
You spoiled bitch.

32:35.818 --> 32:38.405
I came seven times
last night. (LAUGHS)

32:38.488 --> 32:40.616
Well, that's just excessive.

32:45.621 --> 32:46.788
Beautiful.

32:47.205 --> 32:48.373
Thank you.

32:49.458 --> 32:50.792
You're doing well.

32:51.627 --> 32:53.002
I am.

33:00.802 --> 33:02.638
We'd like to increase
your output.

33:02.721 --> 33:05.140
I'm always curious about who "we" is.
(CHUCKLES)

33:06.141 --> 33:09.311
Is that like when "they" say that
faux fur vests are in this season?

33:09.394 --> 33:10.604
You know what I mean?

33:10.687 --> 33:12.481
No, I don't know what you mean.

33:16.359 --> 33:17.402

33:17.486 --> 33:19.862

Oh, (CHUCKLES) Jesus.

33:22.282 --> 33:25.201
What can I say?
We're back in vogue.

33:26.495 --> 33:28.371
Give the people what they want.

33:28.913 --> 33:32.584
Well, I'm gonna need a few more kids
and more cash upfront for treats.

33:32.709 --> 33:35.671
Whatever you need, as always.

33:36.296 --> 33:38.507
Kubra will be happy to hear.

33:39.591 --> 33:42.302
We value your role
in this organization.

33:42.678 --> 33:45.472
Great. Glad
I'm not expendable.

33:51.186 --> 33:53.313
We'll give you a call in a few
days to arrange the next drop.

34:23.217 --> 34:26.262
What? Drug pusher/
heart surgeon?

34:26.388 --> 34:28.724

Just the former.

34:28.806 --> 34:31.560
It was pretty common
among our top customers.

34:33.853 --> 34:35.063
You miss it?

34:35.146 --> 34:37.815
Holy shit. So much.

34:37.899 --> 34:41.695
More than good coffee, more
than sleeping in the dark,

34:41.777 --> 34:43.071
more than wearing skirts.

34:43.196 --> 34:44.239
You wore skirts?

34:44.906 --> 34:46.616
Yeah. I loved
a good skirt.

34:49.952 --> 34:51.079
You?

34:51.788 --> 34:53.206
I don't miss smack.

34:54.165 --> 34:56.376
I was such a lousy
junkie. (CHUCKLES)

34:56.458 --> 34:58.336
Never fully committed.

34:59.337 --> 35:00.797
But the business...

35:01.423 --> 35:03.258
Man, that I miss.

35:03.341 --> 35:06.094
The adrenaline, the power.

35:09.389 --> 35:12.183
Yeah, I miss cooking it. Which
makes me an idiot, right?

35:13.226 --> 35:15.771
I'd let it bubble, even though
you waste it when you do that.

35:15.854 --> 35:19.065
I just loved the chemistry,
you know? The routine.

35:19.608 --> 35:21.651

the chicken, like, ever again?

It's so weird in here, Polly. I
wish I could explain it to you.

growing inside me

gonna tell me what's going on?

you and super-cunt?
