00:05.680 --> 00:07.470
Hello! Hello!

00:07.520 --> 00:10.710
Hello, Earth.
We have a terrible decision to make.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.070
It is an uncertain decision

00:12.120 --> 00:13.600
and we don't have a lot of time.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.710
The man who...

00:17.760 --> 00:19.240
normally helps, he's gone.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.960
Maybe he's not coming back.
In fact, I...

00:24.720 --> 00:26.200
I really don't think he is.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.390
We're on our own.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.040
So...

00:35.000 --> 00:38.040
An innocent life versus
the future of all mankind.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.160
We have 45 minutes to decide.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.350
Courtney Woods.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.950
Doctor, she's gone crazy,
she's uncontrollable.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.470
She took your psychic paper,
she's been using it as fake ID.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.830
~ To get into museums? ~ No,
to buy White Lightning

01:29.880 --> 01:32.870
~ or alcopops or whatever. ~ I've
no idea what you're talking about.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.070
What is Courtney Woods?

01:34.120 --> 01:36.070
She's one of my year tens.
She was in the TARDIS.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.390
~ Doing what? ~ Throwing up.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.910
Oh, her. Oh, that was ages ago.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.750
Look, she says you told her
she wasn't special.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.910
Rubbish.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.270
She says that's what
sent her off the rails.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.030
~ Pfph! ~ Doctor! I know, I know!

01:48.080 --> 01:50.350
But you say something like that to
somebody, it hurts,

01:50.400 --> 01:53.790
especially somebody of her age,
especially if you're you.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.030
Doctor, it can affect her whole life.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.270
Gah!

01:57.320 --> 01:58.910
Oi! Give over!

01:58.960 --> 02:00.150
I got stuff to clean up with!

02:00.200 --> 02:03.190
~ What?! ~ And I got these from
the chemist. ~ Vortex manipulators?

02:03.240 --> 02:04.630
Travel sickness.

02:04.680 --> 02:07.670
Good. Because I don't like
people being sick in my TARDIS.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.750
No being sick. And no hanky-panky.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.270
~ Doctor! ~ Sorry, that's the rules.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.510
Look, Courtney, you're not going to
be needing those

02:14.560 --> 02:18.720
~ because you're not going to be doing
any travelling. Doctor, will you
just tell her?! ~ Tell her what?

02:20.040 --> 02:21.270
Tell her that she's special.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.280
Have you gone bananas?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.080
Do you really think I'm not special?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.550
You can't just take me away
like that.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.950
It's like you kicked a big hole
in...in the side of my life.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.910
You really think it?

02:36.960 --> 02:38.190
I'm nothing?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.680
Not special?

02:47.840 --> 02:49.910
How'd you like to be
the first woman on the moon?

02:49.960 --> 02:52.350
Is that special enough for you?

02:52.400 --> 02:56.150
~ Yeah, all right. ~ OK. Now we can
do something interesting.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.630
Hey!

02:57.680 --> 02:59.120
Doctor!

03:10.480 --> 03:11.960
This isn't the moon.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.190
Where are we?

03:14.240 --> 03:15.950
On a recycled space shuttle.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.350
2049,

03:17.400 --> 03:20.960
judging by that prototype version
of the Bennett oscillator.

03:23.040 --> 03:24.640
Where's the gravity coming from?

03:31.240 --> 03:32.400
What are they?

03:34.840 --> 03:36.550
About 100 nuclear bombs.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.720
Ah. We're on our way to the moon.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.870
Check that -
we're about to crash into it!

03:50.920 --> 03:53.040
Hold on! Hold on!

03:54.480 --> 03:57.240
Why didn't you just tell her
you didn't mean it?!

04:07.160 --> 04:09.270
Who the hell do you think you are?

04:09.320 --> 04:11.950
Why have you got
all these nuclear bombs?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.190
I'm not going to give you
another chance.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.589
Oh, well, you're just going to
have to shoot us, then.

04:16.640 --> 04:18.149
Shoot the little girl first.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.510
~ What?! ~ Yes,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.950
she doesn't want to watch us
getting shot, does she?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.350
She'd be terrified.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.230
Girl first,
then her teacher, and then me.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.870
You'll have to spend a lot of time
shooting me

04:28.920 --> 04:32.070
because I will keep on regenerating.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.950
In fact, I'm not entirely sure

04:34.000 --> 04:36.750
that I won't keep on
regenerating for ever.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.550
Doctor, what are you doing?

04:38.600 --> 04:41.750
Gravity test!
So, it'll be very time-consuming

04:41.800 --> 04:43.070
and messy,

04:43.120 --> 04:44.990
and rather wasteful

04:45.040 --> 04:48.190
because I think I might just
possibly be able to help you.

04:48.240 --> 04:51.590
You see, I am a super-intelligent
alien being

04:51.640 --> 04:53.870
who flies in time and space.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.240
Are you going to shoot me?

04:56.760 --> 04:57.750
No.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.590
Good. Why have you got
all these nuclear bombs?

05:00.640 --> 05:03.230
No, no, no. Easier question -

05:03.280 --> 05:05.400
what's wrong with my yo-yo?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.790
Doctor, it goes up and down.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.160
Bingo!

05:11.800 --> 05:14.030
~ Ah. ~ Ah-ha.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.710
We should be bouncing about this
cabin like little fluffy clouds.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.240
But we're not.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.280
What is the matter with the moon?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.070
Nobody knows.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.240
Do you know what's wrong
with the moon?

05:31.400 --> 05:34.350
~ It's put on weight.
~ How can the moon put on weight?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.630
Lots of ways.

05:35.680 --> 05:38.270
Gravity bombs,
axis alignment systems,

05:38.320 --> 05:40.150
planet shellers.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.230
So it's alien?

05:41.280 --> 05:43.670
Must be causing chaos on Earth.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.870
The tides will be so high
that they will drown whole cities!

05:47.920 --> 05:50.520
~ Yeah.
~ So what are you doing about it?

05:56.160 --> 05:57.510
This?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.520
That's what you do with aliens,
isn't it? Blow them up?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.230
Wow...

06:09.280 --> 06:11.200
Wow!

06:16.480 --> 06:18.870
One small thing for a thing,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.670
one enormous thing
for a thingy-thing!

06:21.720 --> 06:23.400
So much for history.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.790
There was a mining survey,

06:49.840 --> 06:51.150
Mexicans.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.710
Something happened up here,
nobody knows what.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.350
That's when the trouble began
back on Earth.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.430
High tide everywhere at once.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.320
The greatest natural disaster
in history.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.190
Cobwebs?

07:06.240 --> 07:08.640
Henry, go back and prime the bombs.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.950
Um, is there any instructions?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.990
There's a switch on each of them.
The light goes red.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.790
They won't go off?

07:17.840 --> 07:20.190
No, not till I've fiddled
with this thing.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.920
OK.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.350
Shall we?

07:26.400 --> 07:28.590
Is that the best you could get?

07:28.640 --> 07:31.840
Second-hand Space Shuttle,
third-hand astronauts.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.070
How many people here?

08:03.120 --> 08:04.710
Four.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.950
Minera Luna San Pedro.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.670
It was privately financed.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.550
They where doing
a mineral survey up here.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.080
Messages? Mayday? SOS?

08:14.360 --> 08:17.870
Pretty much all the satellites
had been whacked out of orbit.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.910
They managed to send back
some...

08:19.960 --> 08:21.510
screams.

08:21.560 --> 08:24.070
So, then you came up here to
rescue them with your bombs?

08:24.120 --> 08:26.030
Not quite.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.510
They disappeared ten years ago.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.750
Nobody came?

08:28.800 --> 08:30.830
~ There was no shuttle.
~ You had one.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.429
It was in a museum.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.309
They'd cut the back off it
so kids could ride in it.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.960
We'd stopped going into space.
Nobody cared.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.909
Not until...

08:40.960 --> 08:42.480
Courtney!

08:44.560 --> 08:46.390
Oh, my God.

08:46.440 --> 08:48.550
Doctor, tell me there wasn't
anyone inside that thing.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.190
I could,
but it wouldn't make it true.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.200
I'll get some power back on.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.080
Come on.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.150
Courtney, come here.

09:05.200 --> 09:06.960
Don't look.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.630
~ You all right? ~ I'm OK.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.230
Hey, look. Look at me. Look!

09:17.280 --> 09:19.230
It's all right if you're not.

09:19.280 --> 09:20.840
I'm fine.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.160
What did it?

09:28.200 --> 09:29.750
Maybe something...

09:29.800 --> 09:31.390
trying to find out...

09:31.440 --> 09:32.880
how you're put together.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.640
Or maybe...how you tasted.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.350
We have guns?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.720
Not unless you brought some.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.760
Chicken, apparently.

09:50.200 --> 09:51.720
Save the air.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.990
They didn't find anything.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.910
Eh?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.550
The Mexicans.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.750
They didn't find any minerals
on the moon at all.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.080
Nada.

10:33.160 --> 10:35.070
Oh...

10:35.120 --> 10:38.070
~ Oh? ~ Lines of tectonic stress.
~ That's the Mare Fecunditatis.

10:38.120 --> 10:41.190
It's been there since the Apollo
days - it's always been there.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.400
No, no. These are much, much bigger.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.630
Sea of Tranquillity.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.310
Sea of Nectar.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.200
Sea of Ingenuity.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.720
Sea of Crises.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.600
Meaning?

10:57.040 --> 11:01.150
Meaning, Clara, that the moon,
this little planetoid

11:01.200 --> 11:04.030
that's been tagging along beside you
for 100 million years,

11:04.080 --> 11:07.590
which gives you light at night
and seas to sail on,

11:07.640 --> 11:09.590
is in the process
of falling to bits.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.750
Hello, Captain? Captain?

11:27.800 --> 11:29.270
Captain?

11:46.520 --> 11:47.920
Argh!

11:59.000 --> 12:01.870
~ What the hell was that?
~ Duke, is that you?

12:01.920 --> 12:04.240
'I don't sound
anything like that.'

12:05.680 --> 12:07.630
Can you try and get
the lights back on?

12:07.680 --> 12:09.080
'That's what I am doing.'

12:10.480 --> 12:13.840
Torch - give me your torch.
Whatever it is, it's in here.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.350
I think we've found your alien.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.040
~ Back, back, back! We need a door.
A door, a door! ~ Here! Here!

12:50.440 --> 12:51.870
The door's locked.

12:51.920 --> 12:54.430
Come on, come on!
There's no power to work it.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.550
Come on!

12:57.600 --> 12:59.790
Doctor...

12:59.840 --> 13:01.070
Stay still.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.350
It's sensing movement,
it can't see you. Fast movement.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.920
There must be another exit
through there.

13:08.840 --> 13:09.920
Slowly.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.880
Slowly.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.680
(Head to that exit.)

13:20.120 --> 13:21.920
Slowly, slowly.

13:23.280 --> 13:24.830
Slowly. Slowly.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
Gently, gently.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.670
When I say run - run.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.800
Who made you the boss?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.390
Well, you say run, then!

13:37.440 --> 13:39.230
Duke!

13:39.280 --> 13:41.670
Argh!

13:41.720 --> 13:43.240
Duke!

13:44.560 --> 13:47.280
Run! We have power. Run!

13:49.560 --> 13:51.070
~ Quick! It's shutting! ~ Miss!

13:51.120 --> 13:53.110
Courtney! Courtney!

13:53.160 --> 13:55.470
~ Miss! ~ Courtney!

13:55.520 --> 13:56.910
The power's gone again.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.990
It's killed him.
It's coming in here!

13:59.040 --> 14:01.350
Doctor, it's coming in here!

14:01.400 --> 14:04.230
~ You'll be OK! ~ Henry? Henry?

14:04.280 --> 14:07.510
Courtney, look at me. Look at me!
Courtney! Try and get to the wall!

14:07.560 --> 14:09.590
Try and get yourself down here.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.240
Courtney, grab my yo-yo!

14:24.240 --> 14:26.080
Courtney!

14:30.560 --> 14:31.990
Courtney.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.390
Kills 99% of all known germs.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.990
Good stuff, Courtney.
Just don't try that at home, OK?

14:38.040 --> 14:39.270
You all right?

14:39.320 --> 14:42.950
Why did I just fly? This is nuts.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.270
Did you say germs?

14:45.320 --> 14:46.950
Oh, God, this is incredible.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.430
Look at the size of it,
it's the size of a badger!

14:50.480 --> 14:51.710
Doctor...

14:51.760 --> 14:54.390
It's a prokaryotic,
unicellular life form

14:54.440 --> 14:56.150
with non-chromosomal DNA.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.670
Which, as you and me know...

14:57.720 --> 14:59.750
Well, not you and me -
well, you, certainly not.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.030
You and me - yes, scientists know -
this is a germ.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.720
You flew because that 1.3 billion
tonnes shifted. It moved!

15:07.800 --> 15:09.710
It's an unstable mass.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.270
I'm scared, Miss.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.750
OK.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.230
He'd just had a grand-daughter.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.760
Elina. She was his first.

15:19.320 --> 15:21.510
He was my teacher.
He taught me how to fly.

15:21.560 --> 15:24.030
We were both given the sack
on the same day.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.430
Which way to the Mare Fecunditatis?

15:26.480 --> 15:28.600
Please can I go home now?

15:30.400 --> 15:31.880
I'm really...

15:33.520 --> 15:35.270
I'm really sorry...

15:35.320 --> 15:37.640
but I'd like to go home.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.750
Henry, come in.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.830
If you don't mind, Henry, come in.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.830
Doctor, this is dangerous now.

15:48.880 --> 15:49.990
It was dangerous before.

15:50.040 --> 15:52.070
Everything's dangerous
if you want it to be.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.350
Eating chips is dangerous.
Crossing the road.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.670
It's no way to live your life.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.830
Tell her - you're supposed
to be teaching her!

15:57.880 --> 16:00.550
Look, I have a duty of care, OK?
You know what that is?

16:00.600 --> 16:03.630
Course I know what a duty of care
is! What are you suggesting?

16:03.680 --> 16:06.310
She's fine. What are you, 35?

16:06.360 --> 16:07.720
15!

16:12.120 --> 16:14.670
~ Don't touch anything.
~ You got any games?

16:14.720 --> 16:16.670
Don't be so stupid!

16:16.720 --> 16:19.920
~ Can I get reception up here? ~ Get in.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.150
Why are you shutting her in?
We don't need to stay, do we?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.750
~ Eh? ~ It's obvious, isn't it?
The moon doesn't break up.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.120
How do you know?

16:30.120 --> 16:33.080
Because I've been in the future.
The moon is still there...

16:34.240 --> 16:35.360
I think.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.350
You know the moon
is still there, right?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.630
Maybe it isn't the moon.

16:40.680 --> 16:44.270
Maybe it's a hologram or a big
painting. Or a special effect.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.470
Maybe it's a completely
different moon.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.670
But you would know.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.110
~ I ~ would?

16:49.160 --> 16:52.110
If the moon fell to bits in 2049,
somebody would've mentioned it,

16:52.160 --> 16:53.910
it would have come up
in conversation.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.350
So it doesn't break up -
so the world doesn't end.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.310
So let's just get
in the TARDIS and go!

16:58.360 --> 17:01.960
Clara, there are some moments
in time that I simply can't see.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.790
Little eye-blinks.

17:07.839 --> 17:10.430
They don't look the same
as other things.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.030
They're not clear -

17:12.079 --> 17:13.349
they're fuzzy,

17:13.400 --> 17:15.270
they're grey.

17:15.319 --> 17:18.589
Little moments in which
big things are decided.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.560
And this is one of them.

17:22.599 --> 17:25.030
Just now, I can't tell
what happens to the moon,

17:25.079 --> 17:28.640
because whatever happens to the moon
hasn't been decided yet.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.160
And it's going to be decided
here and now.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.790
Which very much sounds as though...

17:37.840 --> 17:40.030
it's up to us.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.590
Neither of you are going anywhere.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.270
I've lost my crew.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.030
We were the last astronauts,

17:46.080 --> 17:48.720
this is the last shuttle,
these are the last nuclear bombs.

17:50.280 --> 17:53.240
We're the last chance for Earth,
and you're staying to help me.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.240
Decision made.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.040
Yeah.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.440
What is killing the moon?

18:32.280 --> 18:34.470
How can the moon die, though?

18:34.520 --> 18:35.830
Everything does.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.040
Sooner or later.

18:37.960 --> 18:39.750
Can we save it?

18:39.800 --> 18:41.520
Depends what's killing it.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.840
There are the other three.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.030
Is it those germ things, then?

19:01.080 --> 19:02.990
Are they like cockroaches? Is it...

19:03.040 --> 19:04.510
Is it an infestation?

19:04.560 --> 19:05.950
Is it?

19:06.000 --> 19:08.030
Well, I've only seen one of them.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.590
It would take an awful lot more

19:09.640 --> 19:14.160
to cause the moon to put on
1.3 billion tonnes.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.910
It's a vacuum - it won't work.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.640
Argh!

19:25.000 --> 19:26.520
Well. That makes two.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.190
Sunlight.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.510
~ Sunlight? ~ If they're germs,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.710
my nan says it's the best
disinfectant there is.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.120
Shine your light down there.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.550
Where have they come from?

19:42.600 --> 19:45.870
Maybe they've been there
all the time.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.110
It's warmish.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.950
They're multiplying.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.230
Feeding.

19:50.280 --> 19:51.480
Evolving.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.430
Doctor, if the moon breaks up,

19:54.480 --> 19:56.870
it'll kill us all
in about 45 minutes.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.000
I agree. Unless something else
is going on.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.910
There's no water on the moon.

20:05.960 --> 20:09.630
It's not water.
It's amniotic fluid.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.990
The stuff that life comes from.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.390
I've got to go down there.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.830
Doctor!

20:13.880 --> 20:15.670
Back to your shuttle.
Get your bombs ready.

20:15.720 --> 20:18.670
You - get to the TARDIS. Get safe.
Get Courtney safe.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.910
I will be back.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.480
What? No... Doctor. Doctor!

20:24.160 --> 20:25.680
Doctor!

20:27.640 --> 20:28.870
Will he?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.560
Will he be back?

20:35.640 --> 20:37.880
If he says so, I suppose he will.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.190
Miss?

20:44.240 --> 20:46.030
Come in.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.110
'Courtney?'

20:47.160 --> 20:48.710
I'm bored. When are you coming back?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.870
'We're on our way. What you doing?'

20:50.920 --> 20:52.790
Putting some pictures on Tumblr.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.910
No! Courtney, don't put
any photos on Tumblr.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.750
My granny used to put
things on Tumblr!

21:08.560 --> 21:10.240
There he is.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.230
Was that where we landed?!

21:25.280 --> 21:26.600
It looks so different.

21:29.240 --> 21:30.990
It's going down.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.440
Courtney!

21:34.640 --> 21:37.830
We going to have to take cover.
We're running out of oxygen.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.110
Doctor!

21:41.400 --> 21:44.400
Today's the day, humankind!

21:45.960 --> 21:48.990
~ Where's the TARDIS? ~ She's in the
shuttle, isn't she? She'll turn up.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.070
Last time you said that, she turned
up on the wrong side of the planet!

21:52.120 --> 21:55.510
~ You two have never gotten on,
have you? ~ Look, we need
to know where Courtney is!

21:55.560 --> 21:56.840
Courtney's safe.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.550
~ Och... Do you have her phone number?
~ No, no, no. Of course I don't
have her phone number!

22:01.600 --> 22:05.590
~ What about the school -
does the secretary have her number?
~ I can't. The secretary hates me -

22:05.640 --> 22:07.630
she thinks I gave her TENA Lady
for Secret Santa.

22:07.680 --> 22:11.990
~ Courtney's posting on Tumblr -
doesn't that know where you are?
~ I don't know. I'm not a historian.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.720
Phone. I know what the problem is.

22:15.720 --> 22:19.080
Oh, she can't post that!
She can't put pictures of me online!

22:20.320 --> 22:22.910
~ 'Yeah?' ~ You can't put
pictures of me online!

22:22.960 --> 22:24.590
~ Are you OK? ~ 'I'm fine. What's up?'

22:24.640 --> 22:27.750
~ You said you know what
the problem is. ~ Yes. Yes!

22:27.800 --> 22:31.070
~ It's a rather big problem. ~ OK. Do
you want to share it with the class?

22:31.120 --> 22:33.230
Well, I had a little hypothesis.

22:33.280 --> 22:36.430
The seismic activity,
the surface breaking up,

22:36.480 --> 22:39.310
the variable mass,
the increase in gravity,

22:39.360 --> 22:40.870
the fluid -

22:40.920 --> 22:42.560
I scanned what's down there.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.790
The moon isn't breaking apart.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.350
Well, actually, it is breaking
apart - and rather quickly.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.990
We've got about an hour and a half -
but that isn't the problem.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.470
It's not infested.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.040
'What are they, then -
those things?'

22:58.240 --> 22:59.350
Bacteria.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.190
Tiny, tiny bacteria.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.110
Living on something very, very big.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.070
Something that weighs
about 1.3 billion tonnes.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.390
Something that's living.
Something growing.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.200
Growing?

23:17.720 --> 23:19.200
That.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.630
~ 'THAT lives under the moon?' ~ No.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.150
What?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.830
THAT doesn't live under the moon.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.670
That IS the moon.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.110
What the hell are you talking about?

23:35.160 --> 23:36.630
The moon isn't breaking apart.

23:36.680 --> 23:38.150
The moon is hatching!

23:38.200 --> 23:40.270
Huh?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.040
The moon's an egg.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.520
Has it, erm...

23:52.120 --> 23:53.990
Has it always...

23:54.040 --> 23:55.430
been an egg?

23:55.480 --> 23:57.550
Yes, for a hundred million
years or so.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.030
Just growing,
just getting ready to be born.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.110
OK, so the moon has
never been the moon?

24:04.160 --> 24:05.950
No, no, no, no.
It's never been dead.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.150
It's just taking a long time
to come alive.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.550
'Is it a chicken?'

24:10.600 --> 24:13.150
~ No! ~ 'Cos, for a chicken to have
laid an egg that big...'

24:13.200 --> 24:15.550
Courtney, don't spoil the moment.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.270
Doctor, what is it?

24:18.320 --> 24:20.680
I think that it's unique.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.750
I think that's the only one
of its kind in the universe.

24:25.800 --> 24:27.880
I think that that is...

24:29.880 --> 24:31.360
..utterly beautiful.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.520
How do we kill it?

24:44.240 --> 24:45.710
Why do you want to kill it?

24:45.760 --> 24:47.320
'It's a little baby.'

24:48.800 --> 24:50.270
Doctor, how do we kill it?

24:50.320 --> 24:51.720
Kill the moon?

24:57.400 --> 24:58.720
Kill the moon.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.830
Well, you have about 100 of
the best man-made nuclear weapons,

25:03.880 --> 25:06.030
if they still work -
if that's what you want to do.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.990
~ Doctor, wait... ~ Will that do it?

25:08.040 --> 25:11.310
100 nuclear bombs set off
right where we are,

25:11.360 --> 25:13.910
right on top of a living,
vulnerable creature -

25:13.960 --> 25:16.350
it'll never feel
the sun on its back.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.510
And then what?
Will the moon still break up?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.790
You said... You said
we had an hour and a half?

25:20.840 --> 25:22.830
Well, there'll be nothing
to make it break up.

25:22.880 --> 25:24.950
There'll be nothing
trying to force its way out.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.510
The gravity of the little dead baby

25:26.560 --> 25:28.510
will pull all the pieces
back together again.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.110
Of course, it won't be very pretty.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.190
You'd have an enormous corpse
floating in the sky.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.750
You might have some
very difficult conversations
to have with your kids.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.230
~ I don't have any kids. ~ Stop.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.550
Right, listen, this is a life.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.910
I mean, this must be
the biggest life in the universe.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.590
'It's not even been born!'

25:44.640 --> 25:48.590
It is killing people.
It is destroying the Earth!

25:48.640 --> 25:50.630
You cannot blame a baby for kicking.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.280
Let me tell you something.

25:53.320 --> 25:56.270
You want to know what
I took back from being in space?

25:56.320 --> 25:58.790
Look at the edge of the Earth.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.270
The atmosphere, that is paper-thin.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.710
That is the only thing
that saves us all from death.

26:03.760 --> 26:07.030
Everything else,
the stars, the blackness -

26:07.080 --> 26:09.870
that's all dead.

26:09.920 --> 26:15.150
Sadly, that is the only life
any of us will ever know.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.680
'There's life HERE.'

26:17.720 --> 26:19.230
'There's life just next door.'

26:19.280 --> 26:20.590
Look, when you've grown up a bit,

26:20.640 --> 26:22.950
you'll realise that everything
doesn't have to be nice.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.630
Some things are just bad.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.230
Anyway. You ran away.
It's none of your business.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.750
'Doctor, I want to come back.'

26:28.800 --> 26:31.110
Courtney, you'll be safer
where you are.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.470
'Doctor, I'm sorry.

26:32.520 --> 26:33.830
'I want to come back, OK?

26:33.880 --> 26:34.870
'I want to help.'

26:34.920 --> 26:36.950
There's some DVDs
on the blue book shelf.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.070
Just stick one into
the TARDIS console -

26:39.120 --> 26:40.310
that'll bring you to me.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.310
~ 'Right.' ~ Make sure you hang on
to the console,

26:42.360 --> 26:44.310
otherwise the TARDIS
will leave you behind.

26:44.360 --> 26:45.440
So...

26:46.800 --> 26:48.200
..what do we do?

26:49.320 --> 26:51.120
Doctor? Huh?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.680
Doctor, what do we do?

26:54.840 --> 26:56.150
Nothing.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.030
What?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.520
WE don't do anything.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.910
I'm sorry, Clara. I can't help you.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.630
Of course you can help.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.750
The Earth isn't my home.
The moon's not my moon. Sorry.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.470
Come on! Hey.

27:10.520 --> 27:15.230
Listen, there are moments
in every civilisation's history

27:15.280 --> 27:18.950
in which the whole path of
that civilisation is decided.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.310
The whole future path.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.230
Whatever future humanity might have

27:24.280 --> 27:28.280
depends upon the choice that is made
right here and right now.

27:30.280 --> 27:34.430
Now, you've got the tools
to kill it. You made them.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.190
You brought them up here all on
your own, with your own ingenuity -

27:38.240 --> 27:39.760
you don't need a Time Lord.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.790
Kill it. Or let it live.
I can't make this decision for you!

27:43.840 --> 27:47.350
~ Yeah, well, I can't make it.
~ There's two of you here.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.590
Yeah, a school teacher
and an astronaut.

27:49.640 --> 27:51.310
Who's better qualified?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.150
I don't know!
The President of America!

27:53.200 --> 27:56.470
Oh, take something off his plate - he
makes far too many decisions anyway.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.990
~ She. ~ She. Sorry.

27:59.040 --> 28:01.830
She hasn't even been into space,
she hasn't been to another planet.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.670
~ How would she even know what to do?
~ I am asking you for help.

28:04.720 --> 28:10.070
Listen, we went to dinner
in Berlin in 1937, right?

28:10.120 --> 28:13.270
We didn't nip out after pudding
and kill Hitler.

28:13.320 --> 28:14.990
I've never killed Hitler.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.390
And you wouldn't expect me
to kill Hitler.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.470
The future is no more malleable
than the past.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.950
OK, don't you do this
to make some kind of point.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.030
Sorry. Well, actually,
no, I'm not sorry.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.560
It's time to take
the stabilisers off your bike!

28:30.480 --> 28:34.150
It's your moon, womankind.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.880
It's your choice.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.750
And you're just going to stand there?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.440
Absolutely not.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.430
Doctor...

28:48.480 --> 28:50.750
A teenager, an astronaut
and a schoolteacher.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.350
Hang on a minute -

28:52.400 --> 28:54.190
we can get in there, can't we?

28:54.240 --> 28:56.750
~ You can sort it out
with that thing. ~ No.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.670
Some decisions are too important
not to make on your own.

28:59.720 --> 29:02.030
Doctor...

29:02.080 --> 29:04.390
Doctor.

29:04.440 --> 29:06.560
Doctor!

29:09.480 --> 29:10.800
Oh, what a prat.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.510
I'm going to detonate
the bombs, agreed?

29:24.560 --> 29:25.880
Agreed?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.720
Hang on tight,
there's been a breach!

29:41.320 --> 29:44.030
If we let it live, what would happen
if the moon wasn't there?

29:44.080 --> 29:48.070
~ We haven't got time for this!
~ We're discussing it! What would
happen if the moon wasn't there?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.990
I have a physics book in my bag.
There's this thing on gravity.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.750
Super(!) Is there a wordsearch?

29:52.800 --> 29:56.310
OK. There would be no tides.
But we'd survive that, right?

29:56.360 --> 29:58.110
They've knocked out the satellites.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.790
There's no internet, no mobiles.
I'd be fine with that.

30:00.840 --> 30:03.350
It's not going to just
stop being there!

30:03.400 --> 30:05.110
Because inside the moon, Miss,

30:05.160 --> 30:07.190
is a gigantic creature
forcing its way out.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.830
And when it does, which is
going to be pretty damn soon,

30:09.880 --> 30:12.270
there'll be huge chunks of the moon
heading right for us,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.190
like whatever killed the dinosaurs,

30:14.240 --> 30:16.230
only about 10,000
times bigger.

30:16.280 --> 30:19.350
But the moon isn't make of rock and
stone, is it? It's made of eggshell!

30:19.400 --> 30:24.710
Oh, God! OK, fine. If, by some
miracle, the shell isn't too thick,

30:24.760 --> 30:27.230
or if it disperses, or it
goes into orbit, or whatever,

30:27.280 --> 30:30.150
there's still going to be
a massive thing there, isn't there,

30:30.200 --> 30:31.830
that just popped out!

30:31.880 --> 30:34.910
And what the hell
do you imagine that is?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.320
Loads of things lay eggs.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.470
It's not a chicken.

30:39.520 --> 30:43.040
I'm not saying it's a chicken.
I'm not completely stupid.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.120
It's an exoparasite.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.350
~ A what? ~ Like a flea.
Or a head louse.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.830
I'm going to have to be
a lot more certain than that
if I'm going to kill a baby.

30:53.880 --> 30:58.470
Oh, you want to talk about babies?
You've probably got babies down
there now. You want to have babies?

30:58.520 --> 31:00.910
Well... Yeah.

31:00.960 --> 31:02.190
Mr Pink...

31:02.240 --> 31:03.230
Shh!

31:03.280 --> 31:06.110
OK, you imagine you've got children
down there on Earth now, right?

31:06.160 --> 31:07.910
Grandchildren maybe.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.390
You want that thing to get out?
Kill them all?

31:10.440 --> 31:14.350
You want today to be the day
life on Earth stopped

31:14.400 --> 31:17.280
because you couldn't make
an unfair decision?

31:20.120 --> 31:22.470
Listen, I don't want to do this.

31:22.520 --> 31:25.520
All my life I've dreamed
about coming here.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.960
But this is how it has to end.

31:31.480 --> 31:32.510
Oi!

31:32.560 --> 31:35.230
I've given us an hour.
There's a cut-out here.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.270
If anyone has any bright ideas,
or if he comes back, that stops it.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.470
But once it's pressed,
it stays pressed.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.360
And if he doesn't come back?

31:45.720 --> 31:47.480
I didn't expecting
to survive anyway.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.870
He's going to come back,
though, right? Isn't he, Miss?

31:51.920 --> 31:55.110
Why don't you call me Clara?

31:55.160 --> 31:58.000
I prefer "Miss", Miss.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.880
We just need to make up
our minds, that's all.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.800
Well, you know him.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.670
I think he really might just be
leaving it to us.

32:12.400 --> 32:14.990
'Can anybody hear me?
Come in, please...'

32:15.040 --> 32:17.030
Lundvik.

32:17.080 --> 32:20.470
~ 'This is ground control.'
~ Yeah, I can tell by your haircut.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.710
How are things down there?

32:22.760 --> 32:24.400
'Pretty bad.'

32:26.600 --> 32:28.190
'Yeah. Pretty bad.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.910
'Listen, we're patched in
to one of the TV satellites.

32:30.960 --> 32:33.110
'We haven't got long.
How are things up there?'

32:33.160 --> 32:35.510
~ Can we broadcast on this?
~ 'Who are you?'

32:35.560 --> 32:36.990
School trip.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.990
Can we broadcast on this?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.830
'Well, yes.'

32:40.880 --> 32:42.240
Hello, Earth.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.750
We have a terrible decision to make.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.670
It's an uncertain decision
and we don't have a lot of time.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.270
We can kill this creature
or we can let it live.

32:52.320 --> 32:55.990
We don't know what it's going to do,
we don't know what's going to happen
when it hatches -

32:56.040 --> 32:58.840
if it will hurt us, help us,
or just leave us alone.

33:00.640 --> 33:02.120
We have to decide together.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.550
This is the last time
we'll be able to speak to you,

33:05.600 --> 33:07.800
but you can send us a message.

33:09.960 --> 33:12.510
If you think we should
kill the creature,

33:12.560 --> 33:14.000
turn your lights off.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.880
If you think we should
take the chance...

33:21.480 --> 33:22.840
..let it live...

33:24.800 --> 33:26.470
..leave your lights on.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.800
We'll be able to see.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.800
Good night, Earth.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.760
Was that OK?

33:43.360 --> 33:44.430
Yeah.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.280
Come on. Let's see.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.600
Night, night.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.280
Oh, Doctor, where have you gone?

35:04.960 --> 35:07.040
We can't risk it all
just to be nice.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.950
OK.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.390
Miss!

35:15.440 --> 35:17.830
~ Nine seconds. ~ You can't!

35:17.880 --> 35:20.840
Sorry, girls.
See you on the other side.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.550
Two...

35:23.600 --> 35:25.480
Hey!

35:28.480 --> 35:32.280
~ One, two, three - into the TARDIS.
~ What's happening?
~ Let's go and have a look, shall we?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.760
Bloody idiots!
Bloody irresponsible idiots!

35:39.880 --> 35:44.030
~ Mind your language, please, there
are children present. ~ You should
have left me there, let me die.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.750
I wanted to die with
the universe in front of me,
not being crushed to death on Earth!

35:47.800 --> 35:51.720
~ Nobody's going to die! ~ Could you
please let us see what's happening?

36:08.320 --> 36:09.840
What's it doing?

36:10.800 --> 36:12.190
It's feeling the sun on itself.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.030
It's getting warm.

36:14.080 --> 36:18.390
The chick flies away
and the eggshell disintegrates.

36:18.440 --> 36:20.080
Harmless.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.200
Did you know?

36:24.960 --> 36:27.350
You made your decision.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.990
Humanity made its choice.

36:29.040 --> 36:31.190
No, we ignored humanity.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.510
Well, there you go.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.470
So what happens now, then?

36:35.520 --> 36:37.880
Tell me what happens now.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.320
In the mid-21st century...

37:03.040 --> 37:06.190
..humankind starts creeping off

37:06.240 --> 37:07.760
into the stars.

37:09.440 --> 37:14.670
Spreads its way
through the galaxy...

37:14.720 --> 37:18.990
to the very edges of the universe.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.550
And it...

37:21.600 --> 37:26.280
endures till the end of time.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.350
And it does all that because,
one day, in the year 2049,

37:36.400 --> 37:39.470
when it had stopped thinking
about going to the stars,

37:39.520 --> 37:42.750
something occurred that
make it look up, not down.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.230
It looked out there
into the blackness

37:45.280 --> 37:49.040
and it saw something beautiful,
something wonderful...

37:50.400 --> 37:52.630
..that for once
it didn't want to destroy.

37:52.680 --> 37:55.190
And in that one moment,

37:55.240 --> 37:57.910
the whole course of history
was changed.

37:57.960 --> 38:01.390
Not bad for a girl
from Coal Hill School.

38:01.440 --> 38:03.560
And her teacher.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.240
Oh, my gosh.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.470
It laid a new egg.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.950
It's beautiful.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.720
Doctor, it's beautiful.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.720
That's what we call a new moon.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.920
You can be the first woman on that!

38:24.240 --> 38:27.830
I think that somebody
deserves a thank you.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.360
Yeah. Probably.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.040
Thank you.

38:37.280 --> 38:39.390
Thank you for stopping me.

38:39.440 --> 38:42.040
Thank you for
giving me the moon back.

38:43.600 --> 38:47.190
OK, Captain. Well, you've got
a whole new space programme

38:47.240 --> 38:49.630
to get together. NASA is...

38:49.680 --> 38:51.190
It's that way.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.550
About 2,500 miles.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.510
You still got
your vortex manipulators?

38:54.560 --> 38:55.960
I'll give you a run home.

39:08.800 --> 39:11.630
Not that it's any of my business,
but I think you did the right thing.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.750
Yeah, you're right.
It's none of your business.

39:13.800 --> 39:17.590
~ Come on, Courtney, off you go -
double Geography. ~ Can we do it again?
~ Go! Go, go. Chop chop.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.440
Tell me what you knew.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.110
~ Nothing. I told you -
I've got grey areas. ~ Yeah.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.030
I noticed.
Tell me what you knew, Doctor,

39:38.080 --> 39:40.320
or I'll smack you so hard
you'll regenerate.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.230
I knew that eggs are not bombs.

39:46.280 --> 39:48.830
I know they don't usually
destroy their nests.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.470
Essentially, what I knew was

39:50.520 --> 39:53.510
that you would always
make the best choice.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.230
I had faith that you would
always make the right choice.

39:56.280 --> 39:58.790
Honestly, do you have
music playing in your head

39:58.840 --> 40:00.470
when you say rubbish like that?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.670
It wasn't my decision to make.
I told you.

40:02.720 --> 40:05.350
Well, why did you do it?
Was it for Courtney, was that it?

40:05.400 --> 40:07.870
Well, she really is
something special now, isn't she?

40:07.920 --> 40:10.390
First woman on the moon,
saved the Earth from itself,

40:10.440 --> 40:13.350
and, rather bizarrely, she becomes
President of the United States!

40:13.400 --> 40:15.270
She met this bloke
called Blinovitch...

40:15.320 --> 40:18.680
Do you know what? Shut up!
I am so sick of listening to you!

40:24.200 --> 40:26.550
Well, I didn't do it for Courtney.

40:26.600 --> 40:29.110
I didn't know what
was going to happen.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.630
~ Do you think I'm lying?
~ I don't know. I don't know!

40:31.680 --> 40:33.870
If you didn't do it for her,
I mean...

40:33.920 --> 40:38.270
Do you know what, it was...
It was cheap, it was pathetic.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.630
No, no, no. It was patronising.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.510
That was you patting us
on the back, saying,

40:41.560 --> 40:44.710
"You're big enough to go
to the shops by yourself now -
go on, toddle along."

40:44.760 --> 40:47.670
No, that was me allowing you to
make a choice about your own future.

40:47.720 --> 40:49.550
That was me...

40:49.600 --> 40:51.150
respecting you.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.870
Oh, my God, really? Was it?

40:52.920 --> 40:55.200
Yeah, well, respected
is NOT how I feel.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.550
Right. OK.

41:01.600 --> 41:03.870
I nearly didn't press that button.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.230
I nearly got it wrong. That was you -
my friend, making me scared,

41:07.280 --> 41:10.990
~ making me feel like
a bloody idiot... ~ Language!

41:11.040 --> 41:13.110
Oh, don't you ever tell me
to mind my language,

41:13.160 --> 41:15.990
don't you ever tell me to
take the stabilisers off my bike,

41:16.040 --> 41:18.750
and don't you dare lump me in with
the rest of all the little humans

41:18.800 --> 41:22.440
that you think are so tiny
and silly and predictable!

41:24.000 --> 41:27.270
You walk our Earth, Doctor,
you breathe our air,

41:27.320 --> 41:29.590
you make us your friends,
and that is your moon too -

41:29.640 --> 41:31.790
and you can damn well
help us when we need it!

41:31.840 --> 41:34.070
~ I was helping.
~ What, by clearing off? ~ Yes!

41:34.120 --> 41:37.190
Yeah, well, clear off! Go on.

41:37.240 --> 41:40.670
You can clear off. Get back in your
lonely... Your lonely bloody TARDIS

41:40.720 --> 41:42.320
and you don't come back!

41:44.720 --> 41:46.400
Clara... Clara!

41:49.280 --> 41:51.310
You go away.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.760
OK?

41:54.280 --> 41:55.880
You go a long way away.

42:27.400 --> 42:28.910
Hello.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.230
Hey! Now, then....

42:30.280 --> 42:32.760
~ What've you been up to? ~ The usual.

42:38.480 --> 42:39.920
It happened, didn't it?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.950
Well, he was wrong, wasn't he?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.350
Wasn't he?

42:46.400 --> 42:47.870
Danny, what do you think?

42:47.920 --> 42:50.190
I think I've seen this look before.

42:50.240 --> 42:51.990
No, you haven't. This is new for me.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.870
No, not on your face - on mine.

42:53.920 --> 42:56.150
~ What did you do? ~ I left the army.

42:56.200 --> 42:57.510
You loved the army.

42:57.560 --> 42:59.670
Yep. And then one day I didn't.

42:59.720 --> 43:03.830
I'm done, I'm done. I am finished
with it. I am... I'm done.

43:03.880 --> 43:06.600
It's over. I'm finished with him,
and I told him that.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.430
What is that face for,
why don't you believe me?

43:10.480 --> 43:12.230
Because you're still angry.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.910
You can never finish with anyone
while they can still make you angry.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.160
Tell him when you're calm.
And then tell me.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.870
When did you get to become so wise?

43:29.920 --> 43:31.520
Same way as anyone else...

43:32.960 --> 43:34.840
I had a really bad day.

44:04.800 --> 44:08.110
There were many trains
to take the name Orient Express,

44:08.160 --> 44:10.600
but only one in space.

44:11.680 --> 44:13.030
Good morning, everyone.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.950
Your goal is to ascertain
the Foretold's true nature.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.990
I know exactly what
this sounds like.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.150
Isn't this exciting!

44:19.200 --> 44:21.310
It's immortal, unstoppable.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.030
~ Unkillable. ~ Can we get a new expert?

44:24.080 --> 44:26.510
Those that bear
the Foretold's stare

44:26.560 --> 44:28.430
have 66 seconds to live.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.120
Start the clock.
