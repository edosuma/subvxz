08:41.888 --> 08:43.256
- You had no business
touching it.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.125

I knew it!

09:02.008 --> 09:04.111
- And you 'bout to be
a "frugitive" from the law.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.847
Only a criminal would dress

09:06.880 --> 09:08.849
- Oh...my...goodness.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.951
You know, I can feel you

this house.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.756

09:15.789 --> 09:17.090
I feel them
little beady eyes

09:17.124 --> 09:19.860

09:19.893 --> 09:21.261
- JEREMY: Grandpa!

09:21.294 --> 09:23.730
He was watching me.

You saw my naked body.

- I need to be committed?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.342
You need to be committed.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.245
You're committed to what is
wrong with this country.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.247
Trump was right.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.248
- I'm about to give you
these hands.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.150
- Okay, alright--

You're gonna give me

- Why?

10:28.236 --> 10:30.605
- Did you stop her? Did you
try to stop her, Grandpa?

10:30.638 --> 10:32.607
- Why would I try to stop
her when you didn't try

10:32.640 --> 10:36.844

down my medicine?

10:36.878 --> 10:38.479

This boy is slow.

If there wasn't a Christian
standing between us,

12:08.002 --> 12:09.971
we could fight.
- Well, let's do it then.

12:10.004 --> 12:11.673

Come on, honey, wake up.

12:36.564 --> 12:38.032
Well...

to the bathroom.

12:41.102 --> 12:42.804

12:42.837 --> 12:44.472
- I don't know,
I fell asleep.

12:44.505 --> 12:46.040
- Okay.

12:47.575 --> 12:49.711

12:49.744 --> 12:52.113
I need you to think, son.
How long ago was it?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.648
- I don't know.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.717
What's happening?

12:55.750 --> 12:58.553
- Well--
- She's not in there.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.422
- Damn.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.859
- What is wrong with
this little girl?

13:04.892 --> 13:06.494
- She didn't get a phone call,
nothing?

13:06.527 --> 13:07.562
- No.
- JEREMY: You sure?

13:07.595 --> 13:08.429
- Yes.

13:08.463 --> 13:10.732
- Well, she did get
a text message.

13:10.765 --> 13:12.000
- How do you know that?

13:12.033 --> 13:13.868
- 'Cause I have her phone
linked to mine.

13:13.901 --> 13:15.103
- Wait, wait, wait.

13:15.136 --> 13:17.872
Is mine linked too?

13:17.905 --> 13:20.775
- No, uh, yours is linked
to mine.

13:20.808 --> 13:22.076
And I've been meaning
to talk to you

13:22.110 --> 13:26.047
about your
fascination with feet.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.081
- What?

13:27.115 --> 13:30.084
I mean...damn, son.

13:30.118 --> 13:33.054
- No, that's an invasion
of privacy.

13:33.087 --> 13:34.922
- You're right.
And I regret it.

13:34.956 --> 13:37.792
- No, I was trying to
click on a video,

13:37.825 --> 13:40.828
it's the cookies.
It's the cookies, Dad.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.131
- Is that what
he thinks cookies is?

13:43.231 --> 13:45.099
- It's a virus.
- Okay, so now you got

13:45.133 --> 13:47.802
a STD.
- What?

13:47.835 --> 13:49.470
No, it's a virus on my phone.

13:49.504 --> 13:52.140
- Can we get back
to this little girl, please?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.809
- Look, I had no idea.

13:54.842 --> 13:59.147
- Well, she sent a text message.

13:59.247 --> 14:00.848
- JEREMY: And?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.785
- And he asked her if she
wanted to go for a ride.

14:03.818 --> 14:05.453
- [sighs] Come on.

14:05.486 --> 14:06.621
- Where we going?

14:06.654 --> 14:08.523
- We gonna ride around
until we find her.

14:08.556 --> 14:11.859
- Ugh, I cannot believe this.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.828
- And when you come back,
we gotta talk about

14:13.861 --> 14:16.464
this phone situation.

14:16.497 --> 14:19.100
- Go to bed, feety.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.568
- Dad!

14:20.601 --> 14:21.669
That is--it was Grandpa!

14:21.703 --> 14:24.439
He said he could help me get
stuff online for free!

14:51.065 --> 14:53.534
- Was she in the room?
- Nope.

14:53.568 --> 14:54.802
- Where could she go?

14:54.836 --> 14:56.738
- Mm, well, her text said
that she riding around

14:56.771 --> 14:57.905

- Uh, well, technically,

14:59.640 --> 15:01.709
he's a man.

15:01.743 --> 15:02.944
- You know, he's right
about that.

15:02.977 --> 15:05.747
- Eh, eh, eh, no, no, no, no.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.248
- Okay, well, I'll go help
you look for her.

15:07.248 --> 15:09.584
- Uh, I don't know if
that's a good idea.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.485
- Why not?

15:10.518 --> 15:13.254
- Somebody has to stay
with the child.

15:15.656 --> 15:18.092
- Oh, right. Right.
- Thank you.

15:18.192 --> 15:20.061
- Come on, baby.
We'll be back.

15:20.094 --> 15:21.896
- Well, I'll walk you
to the door.

15:21.929 --> 15:23.498
- LEAH: [sighs]

15:29.837 --> 15:31.773
- [doorbell rings]
- You know I'm gonna kill you,

15:31.806 --> 15:33.975
right?
- You kill me,

15:34.008 --> 15:38.046
I'm gonna kill you back.

15:38.079 --> 15:42.650
- You won't be able to kill me
back, you'll be dead.

15:42.684 --> 15:46.054
- I'll wake up from the dead.

15:46.087 --> 15:47.955
- When you wake up
and I'm seeing that you alive,

15:47.989 --> 15:51.059
I'm gonna kill you again.

15:51.092 --> 15:55.296
- You can't kill me
three times, though.

15:55.330 --> 15:59.267
- Three strikes, you out.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.435
- You'll stay in prison.

16:00.468 --> 16:02.236
Whenever you feel like
you wanna do what you wanna do,

16:02.236 --> 16:04.772
come over here and do what
you gonna do.

16:04.806 --> 16:06.574
- I'm gonna make it
look like an accident.

16:10.278 --> 16:13.081
- Well, you come on and do it if
you feel like you wanna do it.

16:13.114 --> 16:15.783
- Yes, I got it all
figured out.

16:15.817 --> 16:18.653
- Well, whenever you feel
froggy, jump.

16:18.686 --> 16:21.055
- I'm gonna sneak in your
room and I'm gonna make it

16:21.089 --> 16:25.059
look like you died
choking on a ham sandwich.

16:25.093 --> 16:27.095
I know you like ham.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.863
- Don't you be threatening
me with no ham.

16:28.896 --> 16:30.264
- I'm sorry, but you know what?

16:30.298 --> 16:33.968
I'm gonna come in your room
when you sleep.

16:34.002 --> 16:38.006
And I'm gonna shank you
with a carrot!

16:38.039 --> 16:42.877
- I'll have you to know, I have
a shank-proof blanket.

16:42.910 --> 16:44.946
- And I have you to know
while you sleep,

16:44.979 --> 16:49.250
I'm gon' lift it up,
and shank you with the carrot.

16:49.283 --> 16:50.852
- Well, bring it.

- Uh, I'll bring it.

16:52.086 --> 16:53.054
I'll bring it.
- Bring it.

- Yeah, and you know what?
I've been to jail.

16:56.257 --> 16:58.059
- What? [scoffs] That is all?

16:58.092 --> 16:59.727
I've been to hell and back.

16:59.761 --> 17:04.032
I dated Mabel "Madea" Simmons.

17:04.065 --> 17:07.001
- [scoffs] So did I.

17:07.035 --> 17:08.603
- Well, I had her
in a choke hold,

17:08.636 --> 17:11.005
and I made her tap out.
That's what I did.

17:11.039 --> 17:12.273
I choke her out.

17:12.306 --> 17:14.642
- Uh, that's good, but when
I was with her,

17:14.676 --> 17:17.178
she choked herself.

17:17.178 --> 17:19.013
- Oh, she choke--she choked
herself?

17:19.047 --> 17:20.348
- Yeah, she--she said I was
choking her wrong,

17:20.381 --> 17:23.217
so she said, "Let me do it.
Move your hand.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.687
"Let me choke myself.
Ooh, Vinny!

17:25.720 --> 17:27.021
That's enough!
Stop it!"

17:27.055 --> 17:28.756
I'm like, she was
choking herself.

17:28.790 --> 17:30.191
"Help! Choking myself!"

17:30.191 --> 17:32.226
- Well, you win then.
I ain't into that kind

17:32.260 --> 17:34.295
of stuff.
- I know, I know. I know.

17:34.329 --> 17:36.097
You know what? I'm really
mad because you went

17:36.197 --> 17:38.800
into my weed bag, man.
- I didn't go in no weed bag.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.768
I thought that was just
a bunch of weeds out there,

17:40.802 --> 17:41.869
so I mowed 'em down.

17:41.903 --> 17:42.870
- Mowed 'em down?

17:42.904 --> 17:45.039
You didn't see the big sign
in the backyard

17:45.073 --> 17:49.043
that says, "Please don't
cut down Vinny's weed"?

17:49.077 --> 17:50.845
Big-ass sign.
- I thought that was

17:50.878 --> 17:52.714
for old people.

17:52.747 --> 17:54.916
- Well, you old people.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.218
- You lie. You a old people.

17:57.218 --> 17:58.953
- That might be right, but
we trying to get

17:58.986 --> 18:01.322
some old people in here.
- I know that.

18:01.356 --> 18:03.424
- And we would've had some
if you hadn't cut down

18:03.458 --> 18:05.426
our weed!

18:05.460 --> 18:07.028
- Weed is illegal anyway.

18:07.061 --> 18:09.297
- Not in Colorado.

18:09.330 --> 18:11.232
- We in Georgia!

18:11.232 --> 18:12.867
- Keep thinking that.

18:12.900 --> 18:13.935
- What?

18:13.968 --> 18:17.271
- Don't you know?!
You may not know

18:17.305 --> 18:20.174
that old people like
a lot of sex,

18:20.174 --> 18:23.244
and they like a lot of weed.

18:23.277 --> 18:25.213
- What are you talking about?

18:25.246 --> 18:28.416
- I'm telling you, most of
the cases of STD

18:28.449 --> 18:30.952
is in old folks' homes.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.820
- Man, that ain't true.
- That is true!

18:32.854 --> 18:34.188
Look it up!

18:35.990 --> 18:37.892
Stop it! Stop it!

18:37.925 --> 18:39.694
- I ain't never had no GED.

18:39.727 --> 18:42.196
- It's STD.

18:42.196 --> 18:46.434
- ST--what that stand for?
Stuck To the Booty?

18:46.467 --> 18:48.202
- Stuck to the Booty.

18:48.202 --> 18:49.904
- Does it make you clap?

18:49.937 --> 18:53.007
- Mm-hmm, it make you
burn, too.

18:53.041 --> 18:54.208
- Bugs be pinching

18:54.208 --> 18:55.710

- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.246

Y'all, you just nasty.

you have a lot of problems,

19:04.752 --> 19:06.354
and you have to deal
with a lot of stuff.

19:06.387 --> 19:09.123
But when you get older,
you just don't care.

19:09.223 --> 19:11.359
So you do it.
You do it. You do it.

19:11.392 --> 19:15.063
Smack. Smack. Smack.
Hit it. Hit it.

19:15.096 --> 19:16.764
Hit the honey, oh mm.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.800
Put your fist in it
and you punch it, punch it,

19:18.833 --> 19:20.234
punch it.
Use two fists.

19:20.268 --> 19:22.804

19:22.837 --> 19:26.307

that, you just come in here

19:41.881 --> 19:43.216
and mess up everything.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.853
You go into the backyard and
cut down people's weed?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.254

you what I'm gonna do.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.155

19:54.894 --> 19:56.896

20:01.868 --> 20:03.169
black and white, all races,

20:03.203 --> 20:04.137

"saclute" black people.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.172

20:07.807 --> 20:09.509
- Okay, now listen

20:09.542 --> 20:12.946
If you don't "seclute"
people to be in here--

20:12.979 --> 20:14.347
- Mm-hmm.
- --then we get to take it

20:14.380 --> 20:16.049
out of your profit.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.017

people in here,

20:18.051 --> 20:20.787

20:24.023 --> 20:25.491
- If they can't find
their girl,

20:25.525 --> 20:27.927
we could probably use that
insurance money

20:27.961 --> 20:30.096
to pay it--
- I like that a lot, man.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.998

a whole bunch of people.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.500

in a lot of trouble.

20:34.534 --> 20:36.002
