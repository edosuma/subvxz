13:50.750 --> 13:52.458
Hodge! Stop this!

13:52.583 --> 13:56.166
Stop? We've only just begun!

13:56.166 --> 13:58.000
Did you lose your humanity

13:58.000 --> 14:00.375
when you were assimilated
by the Phalanx?

14:00.375 --> 14:02.625
Or did you have any
to begin with?

14:11.625 --> 14:15.833
I believe the Phalanx nucleus
is here,
in this central chamber.

14:15.958 --> 14:17.625
There is a lower chamber here,

14:17.625 --> 14:20.083
where we've detected
multiple life signs,

14:20.083 --> 14:22.458
probably unassimilated
mutants.

14:22.583 --> 14:24.833
That's where we'll begin
our assault.

14:25.458 --> 14:28.500
Amelia, can you get us
to the lower chamber?

14:28.750 --> 14:29.833
I'll give it a shot.

[METAL CLANKING]

will only last a few minutes.

[BEEPING]

14:51.875 --> 14:55.500
We've got to find Jean
and Lorna before
the force field gives out.

15:06.250 --> 15:09.375
Amelia? Where am I?

15:09.458 --> 15:13.375
In big trouble, Ms. Grey.
We need your powers
to back up the force field.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.125
Keep it up, Jean!
I'll get the others!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.333
Now we need offensive power!

[EXPLODING]

15:33.000 --> 15:34.625
Summers, you fool!

15:34.833 --> 15:37.458
Sinister! I should have known
you were responsible!

15:37.583 --> 15:39.833
Cut it out, Scott!
He's on our side!

15:40.000 --> 15:44.458
Amelia! Start teleporting
them to safety. We'll try
to free the others.

[FIRING]

15:50.333 --> 15:54.000
Oh, the beauty
of digital reproduction.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.625
Is it alive, or is it Phalanx?

16:01.875 --> 16:04.875
MAGNETO:
The Phalanx appears
to be preoccupied.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.958
Are you sure you want
to do this?

16:06.958 --> 16:11.083
It is Self's responsibility.
Thank you, Self-friend Hank.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.166
We are at your disposal.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.000
Perimeter alert!
Core integrity compromised!

16:29.166 --> 16:34.625
Mutants designate, Magneto,
McCoy, Phalanx entity, Warlock!

16:35.208 --> 16:36.875
You will be assimilated!

16:37.000 --> 16:40.875
Magneto, the beard's
a new look for you!

16:40.875 --> 16:43.250
Somehow you pull it off.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.958
Some people
just can't take a compliment.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.708
Let's see just how much power

16:50.708 --> 16:53.250
your little force bubble
can absorb,

16:53.250 --> 16:55.125
before it pops!

16:55.708 --> 17:00.708
This is it! Make it look good.
I must reinforce the field!

17:02.708 --> 17:04.125
BEAST:
Warlock!

17:04.250 --> 17:07.083
Warlock!
You will fulfill your destiny

17:07.083 --> 17:09.875
by merging forever
with the core of the Phalanx!

17:16.083 --> 17:18.875
Self's destiny
is far from fulfilled!

17:18.875 --> 17:21.875
Danger! Virulent agent!
Purge core!

Flesh! No!

18:02.250 --> 18:03.833
Warlock, you're all right.

18:03.958 --> 18:07.000
That is debatable,
Self-friend Hank.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.375
Lifemate! Was she restored?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.583
I'm afraid there
is no sign of her.

18:14.375 --> 18:17.166
It was necessary, was it not,
Self-friend Hank?

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Lifemate? Lifemate!

18:22.708 --> 18:23.875
[CRASHING]

18:26.708 --> 18:29.500
Lifemate! Query.
Can you monitor Self?

18:35.583 --> 18:38.625
Warlock? Query: where is Self?

18:39.416 --> 18:43.125
Self cannot recall anything
of the last 39 cycles!

18:43.125 --> 18:47.625
Another controlled you.
But now you are safe
and we are together!

18:47.875 --> 18:48.875
This is all that matters!

18:59.333 --> 19:04.583
It appears that everything
and everyone has been
fully restored.

19:04.583 --> 19:07.625
It is ironic that a virus
would prove so curative.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.083
Thank you, all.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.875
I never thought I'd see the day
when we would all be
working together.

no new mutant solidarity,

the planet hanging
in the balance,

19:20.875 --> 19:24.208

to save their own skin.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.375
Including Sinister!
Where is he?

19:27.500 --> 19:30.291
Slunk back into the shadows
where he belongs.

19:30.416 --> 19:33.458
Let it go, Scott.
I just want to go home.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.125
Self also wishes
to return home.

19:36.125 --> 19:38.416
Self-friends Hank, Forge,

19:38.750 --> 19:41.875
you have done much
for Self and Lifemate already.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.958
But will you help Self
to return
to the home world?

19:44.958 --> 19:47.250
I'm sure we can construct
a new ship.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.208
But why do you wish to return?

19:50.208 --> 19:54.416
To fulfill Self's destiny!
And free the home world
from the nexus forever.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.458
Self has run from Self's
problems long enough.

19:58.875 --> 20:02.083
Even if you have given up hope
for yourself, Magnus,

20:02.083 --> 20:05.083
there are reasons to work
for a better future.
