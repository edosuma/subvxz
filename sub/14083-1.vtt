02:11.731 --> 02:13.791
We're almost there, Princess.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.062
Thank you, Phillip.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.671
Quite the adventure awaits,
wouldn't you say, your highness?

02:18.738 --> 02:22.175
Just think of it.
A whole two weeks at Camp Royalty,

02:22.242 --> 02:25.940
the great outdoors,
mingling with other royals your own age.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.379
No stuffy ceremonies to attend.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.815
The chance to kick off
my glass slippers?

02:30.884 --> 02:33.718
Try some new things.
Maybe even have a little fun?

02:33.786 --> 02:36.346
A novel concept, indeed.

02:44.297 --> 02:48.359
<i>When lining up on the dock,
Pop Campers, please stay on the right,</i>

02:48.434 --> 02:50.403
<i>royals, to the left.</i>

02:53.940 --> 02:55.431
I'm walking over here!

02:55.842 --> 02:58.334
Hey, Sloane!
Hey!

03:01.714 --> 03:03.842
That's great.
Just a few more things.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.654
Thank you so much!

03:07.720 --> 03:09.086
Aubray!

03:09.155 --> 03:11.750
Genevieve,
it's so good to see you!

03:11.824 --> 03:13.053
Hello, Edmund!

03:13.193 --> 03:14.422
Genevieve!

03:16.229 --> 03:17.458
Selfie!

03:17.564 --> 03:18.564
Right?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.459
...like high quality.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.472
Hey, Marcus, don't drop those!
What?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.442
Ugh. Uncultured show-offs.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.884
Hey, check it out.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.943
Spoiled brats.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.078
Where do you want this luggage?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.488
Has anyone seen a pink hat box?

03:44.591 --> 03:46.219
Whoa!

03:48.494 --> 03:50.622
Princess Courtney,
I must take my leave.

03:50.697 --> 03:53.132
But I shall see you
back here in two weeks.

03:53.199 --> 03:56.363
If I need anything, though,
I can call you, right?

03:56.436 --> 03:58.496
I'm sure
that won't be necessary.

03:59.639 --> 04:03.041
Because I'll be having
too good of a time.

04:03.843 --> 04:05.277
That's the spirit!

04:20.125 --> 04:22.493
Eddie, can you pick up the pace?

04:23.196 --> 04:26.132
I was supposed to be there,
like, five minutes ago.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.363
I'm not gonna get a speeding
ticket just because one of us

04:29.435 --> 04:31.836
hasn't met an alarm
she couldn't sleep through.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.705
You're hilarious.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.868
And the slowest driver ever.

04:36.943 --> 04:40.573
Relax, Erika.
I'll get you to the dock in time, okay?

04:40.647 --> 04:44.448
But why'd you cancel your tour
to go to this Camp Pop anyway?

04:44.517 --> 04:47.419
Having the spotlight to
yourself can get kinda lonely.

04:47.487 --> 04:48.921
You're surrounded
by tons of people,

04:48.988 --> 04:52.152
but no one really feels
like your friend.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.793
Sorry, kid. I didn't realize
things were that tough.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.090
Don't get me wrong,

04:58.164 --> 05:00.861
I'm not complaining,
I love performing.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.669
I don't know,
maybe things will be different at camp.

05:11.210 --> 05:15.204
Princes, princesses,
let's keep things orderly, shall we?

05:17.183 --> 05:18.617
Ugh.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.019
Ugh.

05:21.921 --> 05:24.390
Oh, dear. We're almost
behind schedule.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.016
Who do we have here?

05:26.092 --> 05:28.527
Oh! Princess Aubray
of Allanbrook!

05:31.364 --> 05:33.765
Princess Olivia of Bellmere!

05:36.502 --> 05:38.095
Erika of...

05:38.171 --> 05:41.141
Oh, that's odd,
there's no kingdom listed.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.238
Uh, I'm sorry, but could you...

05:44.310 --> 05:46.336
Are you Erika?

05:46.446 --> 05:48.438
No, but...

05:48.514 --> 05:51.382
If you would be so kind
as to wait your turn.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.147
- Erika!
- Here!

05:53.820 --> 05:54.820
I'm here!

05:55.388 --> 05:56.388
Sorry I'm...

05:56.456 --> 05:57.754
Whoa!
Oh, gracious me!

05:58.725 --> 05:59.988
Oh, careful!

06:00.493 --> 06:03.622
Oh, sorry!
Let me get that...

06:03.696 --> 06:05.028
Oh, thank you.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.929
You're a princess?

06:10.002 --> 06:12.528
That's what my mom
keeps telling me.

06:13.573 --> 06:15.508
Lady Anne's going to love you.

06:17.343 --> 06:21.007
All right, let's move it along, shall we?
It's time to depart!

06:21.080 --> 06:22.412
Well, see ya!

06:22.482 --> 06:23.643
Thank you!

06:26.886 --> 06:28.411
Oh, good.

06:30.189 --> 06:31.189
No!

06:33.092 --> 06:35.357
Wait, you forgot a name!

06:40.066 --> 06:43.127
I'm... Courtney.

06:43.202 --> 06:44.693
Did you say Courtney?

06:44.837 --> 06:46.362
Whoa!

06:50.176 --> 06:51.542
Mmm-hmm.

06:52.545 --> 06:55.310
Hmm. Isn't it hard to
perform in that ball-gown?

06:55.381 --> 06:56.872
Perform?

06:56.949 --> 06:58.417
Anyway, come with me!

07:03.322 --> 07:04.551
Watch your step!

07:04.624 --> 07:05.853
Whoa!

07:27.647 --> 07:29.309
How's it going?

07:41.961 --> 07:43.293
Hello.

07:46.866 --> 07:47.959
How do you do?

07:57.677 --> 07:59.373
Look at that.
Wow!

07:59.479 --> 08:00.845
It's so beautiful!

08:02.381 --> 08:03.974
Cool!
Awesome!

08:31.811 --> 08:33.575
Can't wait!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.738
Can't wait!

08:34.813 --> 08:36.009
Can't wait!

08:36.082 --> 08:37.482
Can't wait!

08:37.549 --> 08:40.486
<i>Can't wait to see everyone</i>

08:40.553 --> 08:43.717
<i>Can't wait to sing in the sun</i>

08:43.789 --> 08:47.123
<i>You know I'm ready for fun</i>

08:47.193 --> 08:49.492
<i>All right</i>

08:49.562 --> 08:52.964
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

08:53.032 --> 08:55.934
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

08:56.002 --> 08:59.336
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

08:59.438 --> 09:01.930
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

09:03.976 --> 09:07.003
<i>Horseback riding,
fine arts every day</i>

09:07.079 --> 09:10.481
<i>Hot beats, cool riffs
New tunes I'll get to play</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:14.385
<i>Feels so magical
everywhere you go</i>

09:14.453 --> 09:16.786
<i>Gonna rock and roll now</i>

09:16.856 --> 09:20.054
<i>Got my ball gowns
High heels, tiara case</i>

09:20.126 --> 09:23.255
<i>High tops, star shades
Speakers, electric bass</i>

09:23.329 --> 09:28.700
<i>Every year it's just like coming home Oh,
yeah!</i>

09:28.768 --> 09:32.034
<i>Can't wait to see everyone</i>

09:32.104 --> 09:34.972

<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

09:44.250 --> 09:46.651
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

09:47.086 --> 09:49.646
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:53.092
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

09:55.161 --> 09:58.325
<i>Now we'll get to be
Singin' our own song</i>

09:58.397 --> 10:01.663
<i>Poised and confident
Nothing can go wrong</i>

10:01.734 --> 10:07.332
<i>Finally get to be
Somewhere we belong</i>

10:07.406 --> 10:08.806
<i>It's my favorite day</i>

10:08.874 --> 10:10.365
<i>It's my favorite place</i>

10:10.443 --> 10:12.275
<i>Guaranteed to be great</i>

10:12.345 --> 10:14.314
<i>Yeah!</i>

10:14.380 --> 10:17.748
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

10:17.817 --> 10:20.150
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

<i>All right</i>

10:40.840 --> 10:43.537
<i>Can't wait to jam by the lake</i>

10:44.276 --> 10:46.939
<i>So many memories to make</i>

10:47.013 --> 10:50.506
<i>Bet we'll be staying awake</i>

10:50.583 --> 10:52.848

11:05.498 --> 11:08.366
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp!</i>

11:10.770 --> 11:12.068
Yeah!

11:12.538 --> 11:13.538
Yeah!

11:14.173 --> 11:15.471
Yeah!

11:17.877 --> 11:21.814
Hey, gang! I'm Finn Oxford,
your fearless leader here

11:21.881 --> 11:23.315
at Camp Pop.

11:23.382 --> 11:24.577
Yeah!

11:24.717 --> 11:25.912
Yeah!

11:27.453 --> 11:29.012
Greetings to all.

11:29.088 --> 11:32.422
I am Lady Anne,
headmistress and owner

11:32.491 --> 11:34.187
of Camp Royalty.

11:34.260 --> 11:35.455
Yeah!

11:35.594 --> 11:36.755
Yeah!

11:36.862 --> 11:39.388
I hope you superstars
are stoked,

11:39.465 --> 11:41.832
'cause the next two weeks
are all about finding

11:41.901 --> 11:45.167
your own individual sound.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.136
Here, you will hone
the skills necessary

11:48.207 --> 11:51.075
to serve your kingdoms
with style and elegance.

11:51.343 --> 11:56.338
For being a proper royal is about
more than merely possessing a title.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.783
Whether you're into pop,
punk, metal or country,

11:59.852 --> 12:02.378
you'll learn how to shred
a guitar solo,

12:02.455 --> 12:06.415
swagger like Jagger and dress like a diva,
darlings.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.996
From equestrian training and fine
art to a cappella and dance.

12:12.064 --> 12:15.125
A magical experience awaits!

12:15.201 --> 12:18.501
And most of all,
you're gonna have fun!

12:18.571 --> 12:22.736
Now, who's ready to rock the house?

12:22.875 --> 12:24.104
Yeah!

12:24.243 --> 12:25.472
Yeah!

12:32.518 --> 12:34.180
Excuse me, could you...

12:34.320 --> 12:35.320
Um... Oh!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.116
Pardon me, but I think I'm...

12:37.556 --> 12:38.683
Okay.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.426
Ugh.

12:41.627 --> 12:42.856
Watch where you're going.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.363
Sorry.
I'm just a little lost.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.425
No kidding.

12:49.502 --> 12:53.303
Looks like Cinderella took a wrong
turn on her way to the ball.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.844
Don't worry about Sloane.

12:59.912 --> 13:03.280
She's super talented
and super grumpy!

13:03.482 --> 13:05.417
I'll try to remember that.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.214
Wait, are you a...

13:07.353 --> 13:09.083
Princess?

13:09.155 --> 13:10.680
Yes, I am.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.260
Whoa, I've never
met one in person.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.954
Me neither.

13:16.028 --> 13:18.156
What're you doing here?

13:18.230 --> 13:21.928
Sticking out like a sore
thumb for the most part.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.630
Would you mind pointing me
towards the office?

13:27.973 --> 13:28.973
Oh.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.107
Thank you, so very much!

13:31.177 --> 13:32.509
You're welcome!

13:40.719 --> 13:42.085
Her hair!

13:42.154 --> 13:44.419
It's so blue!

13:45.891 --> 13:47.860
Who does she look just like?

13:47.927 --> 13:49.452
Erika Juno?

13:49.528 --> 13:52.157
What would she be
doing at Camp Royalty?

13:52.431 --> 13:54.366
Shh! I think she heard us.

13:56.902 --> 13:59.030
This really is going to be
the best year ever.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.766
Yoo-hoo! Prince Chadwick!

14:02.208 --> 14:03.403
Whoa!

14:03.475 --> 14:04.602
Whoa!

14:04.844 --> 14:08.212
Could you please
remove whatever that is?

14:08.280 --> 14:09.873
It's completely in my way!

14:10.549 --> 14:11.949
Sorry about that.

14:12.585 --> 14:17.614
Ugh. What kind of kingdom allows its
royalty to dress like that? Ugh.

14:21.694 --> 14:25.631
Sweetheart, how many times
do I have to say this?

14:25.698 --> 14:29.294
I don't care if you offer me
triple what it's worth,

14:29.368 --> 14:33.362
I am not selling my camp!

14:35.341 --> 14:36.400
In fact,

14:38.110 --> 14:39.544
I'm branching out.

14:48.354 --> 14:50.585
That's absurd.

14:50.656 --> 14:55.560
Darling, this lake isn't big
enough for both of us to expand.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.359
And let's be honest,
music is a fickle business.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.332
One day you're on top,
the next, you're a has-been.

15:03.502 --> 15:07.200
Perhaps you should cut your
losses now and get out!

15:08.574 --> 15:11.806
Oh, at least I'm developing
real talent over here,

15:11.877 --> 15:14.039
while you're doing...
What exactly, eh?

15:14.113 --> 15:16.582
Running an outdated
charm school.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.909
How dare you?

15:19.985 --> 15:21.283
We have a situation.
We have a situation.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.147
This conversation is over!

15:26.759 --> 15:29.729
Nope. Not a princess.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.058
Duchess?

15:31.397 --> 15:32.956
Nah. Uh-uh.

15:33.365 --> 15:37.268
Not even a countess by marriage?

15:37.336 --> 15:40.500
I'm only a teenager, so, no.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.566
You don't know who I am, do you?

15:45.277 --> 15:46.745
Not a clue.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.103
Hmm.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.546
Cool!

15:52.351 --> 15:55.321
Exactly how did this happen?

15:55.521 --> 15:56.521
Oh! Uh...

15:56.655 --> 15:59.124
Her name was on the list.

16:08.267 --> 16:12.796
And when I was called,
I just went where I was told.

16:15.207 --> 16:19.406
Yeah, well, it looks like there's
been some sort of system glitch.

16:23.182 --> 16:26.118
I knew we shouldn't have switched
to the same data-sharing network.

16:26.318 --> 16:31.052
Ugh! Typical of the royals.
Always trying to make my life difficult.

16:37.896 --> 16:40.491
Sorry for the mix-up,
Princess.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.900
But clearly,
you're at the wrong camp.

16:45.804 --> 16:48.035
So, what do I do now?

16:50.175 --> 16:53.202
First, we'll need to verify
your enrollment status,

16:53.278 --> 16:55.645
then correct
the administrative error

16:55.781 --> 16:58.148
in order to process
your transfer.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.777
Trouble is,
it's getting kind of late.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.345
So, there's nothing
we can do right now.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.989
You mean, I have to stay here?

17:07.626 --> 17:11.619
Clive here will find you some
accommodations for the evening.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.290
Off you go now!

17:17.469 --> 17:20.405
We'll take care of this
as soon as we possibly can.

17:20.472 --> 17:21.472
High five?

17:29.481 --> 17:31.074
Here...

17:31.283 --> 17:33.752
Stevie will take care
of your lodging, okay?

17:34.653 --> 17:35.951
Okay.

17:36.021 --> 17:37.045
And don't look so worried.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.318
It's probably
just for one night.

17:42.361 --> 17:43.761
Two at the most!

17:53.405 --> 17:54.771
Whoa! Adorable!

18:05.584 --> 18:08.520
This is going to be interesting.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.291
Huh?

18:18.797 --> 18:19.992
Hello?

18:20.999 --> 18:21.999
Well...

18:22.434 --> 18:23.993
Whoa!
What're you waiting for?

18:26.004 --> 18:27.597
Come on in already.

18:27.673 --> 18:31.303
Make yourself at home.
Nothing's ever locked at Camp Pop.

18:31.376 --> 18:34.346
Yeah! Everybody knows that!

18:35.481 --> 18:38.349
I didn't know. Sorry.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.619
Whoa!

18:44.523 --> 18:47.049
Listen, I hope you don't
mind me saying this, but...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.694
Uh, I'm sorry, what's your name?

18:50.362 --> 18:51.421
Courtney.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.057
I'm Rayna and this is Zia.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.068
Hello!
Pleased to meet you.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.660
Anyway.
No offense, Courtney,

18:57.736 --> 19:00.865
but aren't you a little
over-dressed for camp?

19:00.939 --> 19:02.100
Well, I...

19:02.174 --> 19:03.301
And trust me,

19:03.375 --> 19:06.106
that's coming from somebody who
wears ruffles and fringe...

19:06.178 --> 19:07.612
She's like a parade float.

19:09.381 --> 19:12.874
So, what kind of music do you do?
You know, what's your style?

19:13.719 --> 19:15.711
I don't really have one.

19:16.421 --> 19:17.889
I'm a princess.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.217
Who isn't around here,
am I right?

19:27.766 --> 19:29.894
Wait, you're not kidding.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.493
She's not kidding!

19:32.271 --> 19:33.830
No. I'm not.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.903
So, are we supposed to bow in
your presence or something?

19:39.378 --> 19:41.244
Oh, that won't be necessary.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.644
Do you have any
evil stepsisters?

19:44.716 --> 19:46.810
Well, one is a little bossy.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.883
Have you ever yelled,
"Off with their head"?

19:49.955 --> 19:53.414
No. Royal life isn't nearly
as exciting as that,

19:53.492 --> 19:54.687
trust me.

19:56.929 --> 20:00.093
Do you live in a castle?
Are you cursed by a witch?

20:00.165 --> 20:02.964
Have you ever turned a frog
into a handsome prince?

20:03.035 --> 20:07.097
Zia, come on now,
that's just in fairy tales.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.134
Wait, have you?

20:14.947 --> 20:17.041
A royal tree house?

20:21.587 --> 20:23.988
Whoa, check it out!

20:26.792 --> 20:28.124
Hello?

20:29.194 --> 20:30.958
Anyone here?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.366
Wow. Fancy-schmancy.

20:43.642 --> 20:44.905
May I help you?

20:45.277 --> 20:48.179
Oh! Hi... Well, I'm...

20:48.280 --> 20:50.806
Ooh! You must be here
to give us our manis!

20:50.882 --> 20:52.282
What do you think, Genevieve?

20:52.351 --> 20:54.217
I was thinking
about French tips,

20:54.286 --> 20:57.256
but maybe I should go
with something more daring.

20:57.322 --> 21:00.986
Aubray, unless our guest has
a giant emery board in there,

21:01.059 --> 21:03.961
I don't think
that's why she's here.

21:04.896 --> 21:06.023
Do you?

21:07.032 --> 21:08.830
Well, that's disappointing

21:08.900 --> 21:11.495
because these cuticles
are a mess.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.234
My name's Erika.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.138
Lady Anne said
I could stay here.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.302
But don't worry,
it won't be for long.

21:18.377 --> 21:20.710
I'm moving to the other side
of the lake.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.578
Wait, you're a pop star?

21:24.916 --> 21:26.441
Wait a second...

21:27.286 --> 21:29.585
You're Erika Juno!

21:30.756 --> 21:32.816
Oh.
Yeah, I am.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.656
I wanted you to play
at my sweet 16.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.355
Daddy said, "No."

21:37.429 --> 21:39.455
You're not going to trash
our room, are you?

21:39.531 --> 21:41.557
What? No!

21:41.633 --> 21:43.499
Sign my magazine?

21:43.835 --> 21:45.736
Um, sure.

21:45.804 --> 21:48.035
Blare loud music all night long?

21:48.173 --> 21:49.903
Uh... I brought headphones.

21:51.176 --> 21:54.476
Is it true you get to fly in a private
jet and go all over the world?

21:54.546 --> 21:55.570
Sometimes.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.445
And what about an entourage?

21:57.516 --> 22:00.611
I'd love my own entourage!

22:00.686 --> 22:04.350
You're a princess, Aubray,
you already have an entourage.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.688
Oh. Right.

22:08.560 --> 22:10.358
Have you ever smashed
a guitar on stage?

22:10.429 --> 22:13.558
I saw that in a movie once.
It looked so much like fun.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.276
I can't find it, Zia!

22:24.776 --> 22:26.836
You sure you packed it?

22:26.912 --> 22:29.643
Of course, I'm sure!
I never go anywhere without it!

22:29.815 --> 22:31.306
We're gonna be late!

22:31.750 --> 22:33.309
Uh...

22:36.388 --> 22:38.186
Got it!

22:38.490 --> 22:40.550
So, what do you think?

22:43.395 --> 22:45.830
Very, uh, colorful.

22:46.398 --> 22:50.096
It's just that you already
have such amazing hair.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.203
Hmm.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.896
I guess you're right.

22:54.773 --> 22:57.265
Besides, we have to stop by
wardrobe later anyway.

22:57.342 --> 22:59.243
Maybe I'll find
something better.

23:01.179 --> 23:04.479
You mean, you can wear
whatever you want?

23:04.549 --> 23:07.018
Nobody picks
your clothes for you?

23:07.085 --> 23:09.884
Not since I was three. No.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.423
Anyway, sorry to bolt,

23:11.490 --> 23:13.959
but band practice starts in,
like, five minutes.

23:14.025 --> 23:17.860
And then we've got a "strut your stuff"
dance class after that.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.956
And this year, we get
to learn special effects.

23:21.032 --> 23:23.661
Lasers, lighting,
sparkles, you name it!

23:23.735 --> 23:24.998
Come on, Zia.

23:25.070 --> 23:28.472
I'm guessing that's probably
not her kind of thing.

23:29.641 --> 23:32.236
Unless you wanna check it out?

23:32.310 --> 23:34.404
I mean, as long as you're here.

23:35.514 --> 23:37.745
Uh... I don't know.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.547
No worries.
I just thought it'd be fun.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.310
Hmm.

23:42.387 --> 23:43.387
Fun.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.795
Yes! I mean,
that sounds lovely!

23:54.833 --> 23:56.495
I don't know, Genevieve.

23:56.568 --> 23:59.504
Are you certain we don't have
"tea party etiquette" first?

23:59.571 --> 24:01.005
Positive.

24:06.578 --> 24:09.343
Hold on, how did you do that?

24:09.414 --> 24:10.973
With my scepter, of course.

24:11.049 --> 24:12.813
All royals have one.

24:14.052 --> 24:15.350
Whoa!

24:16.121 --> 24:17.487
Scepter training
starts at 10:00,

24:17.556 --> 24:19.787
after that, it's tea time.

24:20.358 --> 24:23.192
Oh! And then we get
to groom the unicorns!

24:28.333 --> 24:29.631
Yeah, right.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.693
And when do we get
to ride the centaurs?

24:31.770 --> 24:34.535
Wait, does Camp Pop
have centaurs?

24:34.606 --> 24:36.404
That is so unfair!

24:37.075 --> 24:38.839
Right. Unicorns.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.641
I suppose we could bring
you along to meet them.

24:42.814 --> 24:45.147
Wait, what?

24:45.884 --> 24:47.910
They're really beautiful.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.978
Unless you have to get going.

24:50.055 --> 24:53.753
Yeah, I probably should.

24:54.559 --> 24:55.754
Okay.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.267
Hey, wait up!

27:36.821 --> 27:40.588
The size of his ego is
nothing short of astounding!

27:40.659 --> 27:42.423
I mean, honestly,

27:42.494 --> 27:45.089
who in their right mind thinks
teaching a bunch of misfits

27:45.163 --> 27:47.962
how to bang on a cowbell
is more important

27:48.033 --> 27:51.470
than cultivating the finest
royal traditions, hmm?

27:51.536 --> 27:54.062
The man is delusional,
Lady Anne.

27:54.139 --> 27:58.702
What you provide to these budding
monarchs is truly a gift.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.746
It is, isn't it?

28:02.447 --> 28:04.211
Think, Clive. Think!

28:05.417 --> 28:06.417
Hmm.

28:07.786 --> 28:10.381
There must be a way
to acquire his property,

28:10.455 --> 28:13.391
and teach him a lesson
at the same time.

28:14.092 --> 28:16.994
Does it have to be legal?

28:26.404 --> 28:28.373
How lovely.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.638
One of our new campers, perhaps?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.042
Shall we?

28:36.581 --> 28:38.982
See?
I told you it was her!

28:39.751 --> 28:42.653
I can't believe it!
Wow.

28:56.935 --> 29:00.303
Why, I have never heard
such a powerful voice!

29:01.372 --> 29:06.436
Pity it will go to waste under
Finn's mediocre guidance.

29:06.511 --> 29:08.503
Lady Anne,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.208
don't you know who that is?

29:10.281 --> 29:13.718
That's Erika Juno!
She's the coolest thing ever!

29:13.785 --> 29:14.912
Look!

29:20.058 --> 29:23.324
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

29:23.394 --> 29:25.727
A romantic dinner followed
by a walk by the lake?

29:25.797 --> 29:29.165
Oh, Clive, you are a cutup!

29:36.975 --> 29:38.568
Whoa!

29:42.714 --> 29:44.410
Boss, phone call.
Hmm?

29:44.482 --> 29:46.075
It's the "Royal Pain."

29:46.351 --> 29:48.479
About time.

29:48.987 --> 29:50.853
Calling me back so soon?

29:51.489 --> 29:54.721
I mean, I've only left you five
messages about this camper mix-up.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.819
<i>But, who's counting, eh?</i>

29:56.895 --> 29:59.057
Oh, charming as always, Finn.

29:59.130 --> 30:03.898
But, unfortunately, rectifying our
little situation will have to wait,

30:03.968 --> 30:07.905
as I've been informed
that our computer system

30:07.972 --> 30:10.806
has mysteriously gone dead.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.106
<i>Much like your career,
I suspect.</i>

30:13.178 --> 30:15.204
How nice.
You just think that up?

30:15.280 --> 30:18.307
At least we have a skill
the world actually needs!

30:18.950 --> 30:23.752
So, in other words,
your protégés are more deserving than mine,

30:23.822 --> 30:24.881
is that it?

30:24.956 --> 30:27.187
Then why not prove it?

30:27.258 --> 30:30.820
And how do you suggest
we do that?

30:30.895 --> 30:32.625
<i>Well, let me think...</i>

30:33.298 --> 30:35.529
<i>Perhaps a sing-off?</i>

30:35.600 --> 30:38.035
<i>Camp Royalty versus Camp Pop.</i>

30:38.937 --> 30:41.065
My kids against yours?

30:41.472 --> 30:43.634
<i>You can't be serious?</i>

30:43.708 --> 30:45.301
Perfectly.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.436
The winning camp
shall be awarded

30:47.512 --> 30:50.482
all of the property
surrounding the lake.

30:50.548 --> 30:54.918
The losing camp shall
close its doors for good.

30:54.986 --> 30:58.923
Why do I get the feeling that
you're up to something? Eh?

30:59.357 --> 31:03.419
After all,
you've got one of my pop kids over there.

31:03.494 --> 31:07.795
Please. And you have
an entire camp full of them!

31:07.866 --> 31:09.300
So, why worry?

31:10.702 --> 31:13.695
Unless you're not up
for the challenge.

31:15.473 --> 31:17.942
Lady A, you're on!

31:18.009 --> 31:19.009
Excellent.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.875
Clive will be in touch
to work out the details.

31:24.682 --> 31:26.207
How it is possible
that you and that man

31:26.284 --> 31:27.513
were ever romantically involved,

31:27.585 --> 31:29.053
I will never know.

31:29.787 --> 31:30.811
Oh.

31:30.889 --> 31:32.915
It was a long time ago, Clive.

31:33.625 --> 31:37.619
Before I realized that rock
and royalty do not mix.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.134
You're not serious, Courtney!

31:43.201 --> 31:44.829
No, really.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.895
And then, when she unveiled
her portrait,

31:46.971 --> 31:49.463
it was a donkey in a dress.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.610
You pranked the Duchess?
Did she ever find out?

31:54.712 --> 31:56.044
Nope!

31:56.714 --> 31:58.740
I've never told
anyone that before.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.183
Well, we're truly honored.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.245
To Courtney, Princess of Pranks.

32:07.225 --> 32:09.660
And so, long story short,

32:09.727 --> 32:12.595
that's when I got to sing
my very first solo!

32:13.631 --> 32:15.691
At the Paris Palladium?

32:15.767 --> 32:17.258
When you were five?

32:17.335 --> 32:20.271
I could barely dress
myself at that age.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.874
You're not that great
at it now, Edmund.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.277
<i>Greetings, everyone,</i>

32:27.345 --> 32:29.644
<i>I have a thrilling announcement.</i>

32:29.714 --> 32:31.842
<i>At the conclusion
of this year's session,</i>

32:31.916 --> 32:36.183
<i>we shall participate in what promises
to be another glorious moment</i>

32:36.254 --> 32:38.485
<i>in our storied history.</i>

32:38.556 --> 32:42.687
<i>We're talking about the biggest
challenge ever to hit this lake!</i>

32:42.760 --> 32:46.026
<i>A competition to end
all competitions!</i>

32:46.097 --> 32:50.034
<i>A sing-off between
Camp Pop and Camp Royalty!</i>

32:50.935 --> 32:52.426
- Yeah!
- Yeah...

32:55.306 --> 32:58.674
<i>And check out who's
agreed to be our judges.</i>

32:58.743 --> 33:01.338
<i>Rock legend Allegra James.</i>

33:01.446 --> 33:03.312
Yeah!

33:05.149 --> 33:07.584
<i>Prince Reginald of Thistlebrook!</i>

33:10.288 --> 33:14.783
<i>And Svetlana Petranova,
head of Camp Arabesque.</i>

33:14.993 --> 33:16.120
I don't know who that is.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.389
I feel like
I should know who that is.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.194
<i>Rehearsals shall commence
first thing in the morning.</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:25.167
<i>So, get ready to rock!</i>

33:25.236 --> 33:27.762
<i>And may the best camp win!</i>

33:33.011 --> 33:35.139
Is there a word for something
that's more awesome

33:35.213 --> 33:36.681
than just regular awesome?

33:36.748 --> 33:39.240
'Cause that's what
this sing-off's gonna be!

33:39.317 --> 33:42.287
Those snooty little royals
aren't gonna know what hit 'em!

33:43.688 --> 33:45.088
Sorry, Courtney.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.352
I forgot those are your people.

33:48.126 --> 33:49.526
Please. I'm not offended.

33:49.594 --> 33:53.224
I've never been to Camp
Royalty or know anyone there.

33:53.297 --> 33:56.028
And Camp Pop is so different
than I expected.

33:56.401 --> 33:59.530
Whatever happens,
you're going to be amazing.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.402
Don't you mean "we"?

34:01.472 --> 34:04.340
Long as you're here,
Princess, you're one of us.

34:04.409 --> 34:05.741
You're part of the band!

34:05.810 --> 34:07.039
Thank you.

34:07.111 --> 34:10.138
But, I'm not sure what
I would have to offer.

34:10.214 --> 34:13.810
Girl, you need to loosen up
and have some fun!

34:13.885 --> 34:16.753
Everyone's got a talent,
you just need to let it out!

34:16.853 --> 34:19.688
I know.
You're right.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.884
I'm working on it.

34:20.958 --> 34:21.982
And while you're at it,

34:22.060 --> 34:24.393
maybe you should work
on your wardrobe, too.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.592
Wait, what's wrong
with my dress?

34:29.467 --> 34:30.833
Well, it's...

34:30.902 --> 34:32.928
Nothing a little
restyling won't fix.

34:35.339 --> 34:37.433
No, wait!

34:50.254 --> 34:53.713
That was so cool!
Wasn't that cool?

34:54.192 --> 34:56.922
How's this for a start?

34:56.994 --> 35:00.158
Now that's a dress!
What else can you do with that?

35:00.231 --> 35:01.426
Can I try?

35:06.871 --> 35:11.206
Wow.
It feels so, so tingly.

35:11.809 --> 35:13.368
That's how you know it's working.

35:16.647 --> 35:19.139
Genevieve, where have you been?

35:20.284 --> 35:21.946
You're late for beauty night.

35:22.019 --> 35:26.081
Olivia cornered me after dinner
to talk about the competition.

35:26.157 --> 35:28.649
Her tiara's in a twist
over song selection.

35:28.726 --> 35:31.992
You guys must be psyched about
going head-to-head with Camp Pop.

35:33.331 --> 35:34.924
Of course!
Absolutely!

35:36.033 --> 35:38.093
Actually, no.
Not really.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.269
We're good, but not that good.

35:42.173 --> 35:44.039
We're really not.

35:44.108 --> 35:46.668
Guys, don't underestimate
yourselves.

35:46.744 --> 35:49.714
Listen, whenever I get nervous
in front of a large crowd...

35:49.780 --> 35:52.079
You picture everyone
in their underwear?

35:52.150 --> 35:53.641
No. Gross.

35:54.452 --> 35:58.753
I just close my eyes and imagine
I'm singing all by myself.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.621
Then I'm fine.

36:00.691 --> 36:01.852
You can do this.

36:01.926 --> 36:05.328
And while I'm here,
I'll help how I can.

36:05.396 --> 36:06.455
Really?

36:06.531 --> 36:07.829
You would do that for us?

36:07.899 --> 36:09.492
Totally!

36:09.667 --> 36:10.667
Oh.

36:10.902 --> 36:12.564
That's what friends do.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.450
Okay, gang, take five!

36:29.921 --> 36:31.514
Hey, Courtney.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.218
Uh, yeah. Listen,
I'm sorry for the holdup,

36:36.294 --> 36:39.731
but I haven't been able to make
any headway with Camp Royalty

36:39.797 --> 36:41.356
about your transfer.

36:41.432 --> 36:42.764
It's fine, really.

36:43.234 --> 36:46.864
Uh, really?
I'm actually having a good time.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.873
Everyone is really nice.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.670
It's just so different here.

36:50.741 --> 36:54.405
Being around so many creative
people is inspiring!

36:54.478 --> 36:56.003
Oh, that's great.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.446
I'd love to stay.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.982
You got it, Princess.

36:59.984 --> 37:01.282
High five?

37:02.019 --> 37:05.046
Let's go,
superstars. From the top!

37:15.099 --> 37:16.328
That looks perfect

37:16.400 --> 37:17.527
I don't know...

37:17.602 --> 37:19.969
Trust me, it looks brilliant!
Huh?

37:20.037 --> 37:22.006
Okay, if you say so.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.073
Erika.

37:23.674 --> 37:26.906
I almost didn't recognize you.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.415
Yeah, it's not exactly my style,

37:30.481 --> 37:33.110
but my roomies here
thought I needed a new look.

37:33.184 --> 37:34.846
It was long overdue.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.013
And it totally suits you!

37:37.088 --> 37:38.147
It does.

37:38.222 --> 37:40.782
You look amazing!

37:41.692 --> 37:43.354
Thanks.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.157
Erika.

37:45.229 --> 37:46.891
May I have a word?

37:46.964 --> 37:48.830
See you later, guys.
Bye.

37:48.899 --> 37:50.333
See you later.
Bye.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.029
As you must have
surmised by now,

37:54.105 --> 37:58.099
your transfer to Camp Pop
has hit a slight snag.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.304
A complete lack of
organization on their part.

38:01.379 --> 38:04.543
But I trust you've been
made to feel welcome here.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.517
Absolutely.
It's been cool.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.178
I've made some great friends.

38:09.253 --> 38:10.744
Lovely.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.585
And speaking of that,

38:12.657 --> 38:17.686
I had the absolute pleasure of
hearing you sing yesterday.

38:17.762 --> 38:20.891
We are all huge,
huge fans of your work.

38:20.965 --> 38:21.965
Thanks.

38:22.033 --> 38:24.229
No, thank you.

38:24.302 --> 38:28.330
A talent like yours
is a rare find indeed.

38:28.406 --> 38:33.640
In fact, I only wish you could remain
here and compete in the sing-off

38:33.711 --> 38:36.613
as a member of Camp
Royalty's a cappella group.

38:36.681 --> 38:39.276
As our featured vocalist?

38:39.350 --> 38:42.252
What an honor that would be!

38:43.020 --> 38:45.080
Wow, I don't know what to say.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.284
I mean, I guess I could.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.418
Splendid!

38:49.493 --> 38:51.724
Run along now, our star!

38:51.796 --> 38:53.822
Ta-ta.
Bye.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.170
Hello?

39:04.809 --> 39:06.334
Is anyone here?

39:08.813 --> 39:10.907
Hmm. I must be early.

39:53.624 --> 39:57.459
<i>I spend too much
time thinking about</i>

39:57.528 --> 40:00.327
<i>Who I'm supposed to be</i>

40:00.398 --> 40:04.335
<i>I play by everybody's rules</i>

40:04.402 --> 40:08.100
<i>That don't seem right to me</i>

40:08.172 --> 40:11.802
<i>I'm cool and polite
on the outside</i>

40:11.876 --> 40:15.972
<i>But when I get a chance
I run and I hide</i>

40:16.046 --> 40:21.610
<i>If your eyes are closed
It's hard to see</i>

40:22.319 --> 40:26.347
<i>What if I back down now</i>

40:26.424 --> 40:29.861
<i>'Cause I'm afraid
of what might happen</i>

40:29.927 --> 40:33.022
<i>What if they turn away</i>

40:33.097 --> 40:37.159
<i>When I show them who I truly am?</i>

40:37.234 --> 40:41.035
<i>What if I lose my breath</i>

40:41.105 --> 40:44.507
<i>When I throw
those big doors open?</i>

40:44.575 --> 40:48.103
<i>Or tonight</i>

40:48.179 --> 40:50.546
<i>Just tonight</i>

40:51.882 --> 40:54.977
<i>What if I shine?</i>

40:59.623 --> 41:01.819
<i>Should I even care</i>

41:01.892 --> 41:03.417
<i>They're all sitting there</i>

41:03.494 --> 41:06.692
<i>And everyone's staring at me</i>

41:06.764 --> 41:09.290
<i>If I step out in the spotlight</i>

41:09.366 --> 41:13.133
<i>Maybe I'll be set free</i>

41:14.004 --> 41:17.805
<i>What if I back down now</i>

41:17.875 --> 41:21.368
<i>'Cause I'm afraid
of what might happen</i>

41:21.445 --> 41:24.711
<i>What if they turn away</i>

41:24.782 --> 41:29.083
<i>When I show them who I truly am?</i>

41:29.153 --> 41:32.612
<i>What if I lose my breath</i>

41:32.690 --> 41:36.422
<i>When I throw
those big doors open?</i>

41:36.494 --> 41:38.520
<i>Or tonight</i>

41:39.964 --> 41:42.456
<i>Just tonight</i>

41:43.634 --> 41:48.265
<i>What if I shine?</i>

41:48.339 --> 41:51.400
<i>I...</i>

41:51.475 --> 41:57.073
<i>Shine...</i>

41:59.116 --> 42:03.076
<i>I've spent too much time
thinking about</i>

42:03.153 --> 42:05.713
<i>Who I'm supposed to be</i>

42:07.491 --> 42:11.428
<i>But what if I sing out loud</i>

42:11.495 --> 42:14.897
<i>Because anything can happen</i>

42:14.965 --> 42:18.402
<i>What if I stand up proud</i>

42:18.469 --> 42:21.871
<i>And show them who I truly am</i>

42:21.939 --> 42:26.070
<i>They're gonna call my name</i>

42:26.143 --> 42:29.807
<i>And I'll throw
these big doors open</i>

42:29.880 --> 42:33.317
<i>'Cause tonight</i>

42:33.384 --> 42:37.185
<i>Just tonight</i>

42:37.254 --> 42:41.715
<i>I'm gonna shine</i>

42:41.792 --> 42:45.285
<i>I...</i>

42:45.362 --> 42:51.131
<i>Shine...</i>

42:53.604 --> 42:54.628
Whoa!

42:54.705 --> 42:56.367
What was that?

42:56.473 --> 42:58.066
Where did you learn that?

42:58.142 --> 43:00.873
I, kind of, wrote it.

43:00.945 --> 43:02.413
You wrote that?

43:02.479 --> 43:04.141
That was off the hook.

43:04.214 --> 43:06.809
I'm not really allowed
to play it at the castle.

43:06.884 --> 43:09.444
It's kind of
a "classical music only" zone.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.886
Do you have any more?

43:11.021 --> 43:12.387
More?

43:12.456 --> 43:16.450
But you guys are so good.
Why would you want to play my music?

43:16.527 --> 43:18.393
My thoughts exactly.

43:18.762 --> 43:22.358
As our friend Marcus here said,
"What was that?"

43:22.733 --> 43:25.703
I think it's called
making music, Sloane.

43:25.769 --> 43:28.034
It's a little something
we do around here.

43:28.105 --> 43:30.472
And it was slamming!

43:30.541 --> 43:32.737
Who knew Courtney
could sing like that?

43:32.810 --> 43:36.303
Hello? We have
a competition coming up.

43:36.380 --> 43:39.009
So maybe you should skip
the sappy sing-alongs,

43:39.083 --> 43:42.212
and practice the actual number
we're going to perform.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.923
Okay with you, Princess?

43:45.990 --> 43:49.392
Or would you rather go across
the lake where you belong?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.088
Courtney, don't listen
to Sloane.

43:51.161 --> 43:52.356
You were awesome.

43:52.429 --> 43:53.429
So good!

43:54.765 --> 43:56.757
Thanks. I appreciate it.

43:59.003 --> 44:01.495
Sorry, I just need
some fresh air.

44:08.045 --> 44:10.742
We are at camp.
Isn't all the air fresh?

44:10.814 --> 44:11.907
Zia!

44:17.354 --> 44:22.520
<i>It is the role of a
princess To hold her head up high</i>

44:22.593 --> 44:27.964
<i>An honor, a privilege
Today and days gone by</i>

44:28.032 --> 44:32.970
<i>A princess is loyal
A smile upon her face</i>

44:33.037 --> 44:37.475
<i>Wherever she may travel
The world's a better place</i>

44:37.541 --> 44:42.479
<i>When you're a princess
It's all up to you</i>

44:42.546 --> 44:48.178
<i>When you're a princess
The good that you do</i>

44:48.252 --> 44:52.917
<i>And now we're together
For summer in the sun</i>

44:52.990 --> 44:58.258
<i>We're dancing and singing
The day is never done</i>

44:58.328 --> 45:03.357
<i>Tea parties, tiaras
The finest lines of lace</i>

45:03.434 --> 45:08.270
<i>Whenever we're together
The world's a better place</i>

45:08.338 --> 45:10.432
<i>When you're a princess</i>

45:10.507 --> 45:12.806
<i>Ooh It's all up to you</i>

45:12.876 --> 45:17.871
<i>When you're a princess
The good that you do</i>

45:17.948 --> 45:22.943
<i>When you're a princess
The way that you live</i>

45:23.020 --> 45:28.118
<i>When you're a princess
You get what you give</i>

45:29.293 --> 45:31.626
<i>Attend the royal ball</i>

45:31.695 --> 45:34.028
<i>Be kind to one and all</i>

45:34.098 --> 45:36.363
<i>Make sure to set your sights</i>

45:36.433 --> 45:38.402
<i>Higher</i>

45:38.469 --> 45:43.169
<i>Strive to be true, to be true</i>

45:43.240 --> 45:48.008
<i>This is our responsibility</i>

45:48.078 --> 45:50.570
<i>When you're a princess</i>

45:50.647 --> 45:53.207
<i>It's all up to you
You're a leader</i>

45:53.283 --> 45:58.051
<i>When you're a princess
The good that you do</i>

45:58.122 --> 46:00.785
<i>When you're a princess</i>

46:00.858 --> 46:03.293
<i>The way that you live
You're in charge</i>

46:03.360 --> 46:05.886
<i>When you're a princess You're in charge,
yes, you are</i>

46:05.963 --> 46:08.330
<i>You're in charge
You get what you give</i>

46:08.398 --> 46:14.338
<i>When you're a princess</i>

46:19.910 --> 46:20.910
Cut!

46:20.978 --> 46:23.846
What, may I ask, was that?

46:23.914 --> 46:25.746
Just a little improv.

46:25.816 --> 46:28.615
I thought the song
could use more edge.

46:28.685 --> 46:32.588
Oh, I see. And you just decided
that all on your own, did you?

46:32.656 --> 46:34.750
Yeah. I did.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.124
You can solo all you want
at Camp Pop,

46:37.194 --> 46:41.029
but at Camp Royalty,
we do things as an ensemble.

46:41.098 --> 46:44.535
The whole point is to blend in,
not stand out.

46:44.601 --> 46:47.230
Olivia, maybe Erika has a point.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.001
Updating our material
might not be a bad thing.

46:50.073 --> 46:52.508
After all, we're competing
with Camp Pop.

46:52.576 --> 46:54.875
And we're going to lose!

46:54.945 --> 46:57.608
Sorry, did I say that out loud?

47:01.785 --> 47:03.447
The song is perfect
the way it is!

47:03.520 --> 47:05.079
We don't need to change a thing.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.418
Are we clear?

47:07.257 --> 47:08.725
Crystal.

47:09.459 --> 47:12.452
Maybe you might be more
comfortable across the lake.

47:12.529 --> 47:13.792
Erika!

47:14.531 --> 47:17.057
Ugh. I can't work
with these people!

47:17.134 --> 47:18.295
Erika?

47:18.368 --> 47:19.836
Not now, Clive!

47:22.239 --> 47:26.267
No! Lady Anne cannot lose because
of some unpredictable pop star.

47:27.911 --> 47:30.312
Okay, Clive, it's hero time!

47:36.587 --> 47:39.921
<i>What if I sing out loud</i>

47:40.557 --> 47:44.517
<i>Because anything can happen</i>

47:44.595 --> 47:48.225
<i>What if I stand up proud</i>

47:48.298 --> 47:52.702
<i>And show them who I truly am</i>

47:52.769 --> 47:54.897
<i>They're gonna call my...</i>

47:54.972 --> 47:56.668
That's really beautiful.

47:57.207 --> 48:00.143
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

48:00.210 --> 48:03.544
Happens to me all the time,
getting lost in a song.

48:05.349 --> 48:07.215
Hey, I know you.

48:08.685 --> 48:10.313
We met on the dock.

48:10.387 --> 48:13.551
Right, when I was trying
to make the boat.

48:13.624 --> 48:15.752
The wrong boat, by the way...

48:15.826 --> 48:19.422
Wait, you're the one who's
supposed to be at Camp Pop.

48:19.496 --> 48:23.456
'Cause you're the one who's
supposed to be at Camp Royalty.

48:25.602 --> 48:26.729
I'm Erika.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.335
Pleasure to meet you.

48:28.405 --> 48:29.668
I'm Courtney.

48:30.607 --> 48:31.870
Princess Courtney?

48:32.009 --> 48:33.272
Just Courtney.

48:33.343 --> 48:36.745
Should I call you Princess Erika?
Nice ball gown.

48:36.813 --> 48:39.806
Oh, right. No, I...

48:39.883 --> 48:42.114
I was just trying
to royal it up, I guess.

48:42.185 --> 48:43.949
That's a cool outfit, too.

48:44.021 --> 48:46.047
Thanks.
It was a nice change.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.325
I mean,
I was just trying to liven up the song.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.866
But Olivia wasn't having
any of it.

48:55.933 --> 49:00.564
I'm sorry to hear that. Tradition
can be really important to royals.

49:00.637 --> 49:02.037
Change is scary.

49:02.105 --> 49:04.199
So are angry princesses!

49:05.509 --> 49:06.772
I know what you mean, though.

49:06.843 --> 49:10.837
Some of the Pop kids didn't take
kindly to me singing one of my songs.

49:10.914 --> 49:12.815
Music can be really competitive.

49:12.883 --> 49:16.217
She probably feels threatened by you.
You're good!

49:16.286 --> 49:17.686
Thanks.

49:20.624 --> 49:25.187
I guess we were just fooling
ourselves thinking we could fit in.

49:25.262 --> 49:28.255
So, it's a plan?
We just do it.

49:28.732 --> 49:30.257
Switch camps right now?

49:30.334 --> 49:32.394
I don't see why we can't.

49:32.469 --> 49:34.461
Okay, let's do this.

49:34.538 --> 49:37.064
Just follow the lakeshore till
you reach a bunch of castles.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.164
You, too.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.472
But stop at the big piano.

49:40.544 --> 49:41.842
That sounds cool!

49:41.912 --> 49:44.347
It is, you're going
to love Camp Pop.

49:44.414 --> 49:46.144
It's so much fun!

49:46.216 --> 49:48.947
And I think you'll really
like Camp Royalty.

49:49.019 --> 49:52.046
I mean, I thought
it was gonna be awful.

49:52.122 --> 49:55.422
But some of the people
I've met are really awesome.

49:55.492 --> 49:59.224
The friends I made at Camp
Pop are really nice, too.

49:59.296 --> 50:01.891
That's what I'll miss,
the friends.

50:02.966 --> 50:06.334
Well now I feel
worse than before.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.637
You know,
we could always not switch camps.

50:11.074 --> 50:12.838
Keep things the way they are.

50:12.909 --> 50:14.605
And make the best of it.

50:14.678 --> 50:16.909
After all,
there's only a week left.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.149
See you
at the sing-off?

50:20.217 --> 50:21.776
Wouldn't miss it.

50:28.492 --> 50:31.257
So as I was saying,
Miss Petranova,

50:31.328 --> 50:34.628
Allegra James will most
likely side with Camp Pop,

50:34.698 --> 50:39.363
while Prince Reginald will undoubtedly
remain loyal to Camp Royalty.

50:39.436 --> 50:42.873
Which leaves
one vote still in play.

50:50.013 --> 50:52.812
So, we have a deal?

50:55.952 --> 50:59.480
Ugh! Because it's a waste
of our time, that's why!

50:59.556 --> 51:02.082
But how do you know if you
won't even listen to it?

51:02.159 --> 51:03.388
Listen to what?

51:04.027 --> 51:05.222
Nothing, Lady Anne.

51:05.295 --> 51:07.821
Just an artistic
difference of opinion.

51:07.898 --> 51:10.367
It's just a new song I've
been playing around with.

51:10.434 --> 51:11.925
May I see?

51:12.002 --> 51:14.335
I thought it might give
us a fresher sound.

51:15.205 --> 51:19.165
But as I was just
explaining to our "guest,"

51:20.343 --> 51:23.507
Camp Royalty's performance piece
has already been selected.

51:23.580 --> 51:26.311
And given what little
rehearsal time we have left...

51:26.383 --> 51:27.749
I say you do it.

51:28.585 --> 51:30.645
I'm sorry, do what now?

51:30.720 --> 51:32.348
Perform Erika's song.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.584
She's absolutely right,
it's fresh.

51:34.658 --> 51:37.253
It's original!
It's got pizzazz!

51:37.327 --> 51:41.230
And it will provide the perfect
spotlight for her superstar talent,

51:41.298 --> 51:44.826
which is our key to
victory over Camp Pop!

51:44.901 --> 51:46.130
Thanks, Lady Anne.

51:46.269 --> 51:47.464
My pleasure.

51:47.537 --> 51:51.167
Now get to work and make
Camp Royalty proud.

52:01.418 --> 52:03.580
No, no, no!

52:05.388 --> 52:07.050
Are you serious?

52:07.124 --> 52:09.389
That's the best you can do?

52:09.459 --> 52:12.452
Rayna,
you missed the key change on the bridge.

52:12.529 --> 52:16.125
Zia, you missed
the bridge entirely!

52:16.199 --> 52:18.498
And you guys were flatter
than a pancake!

52:20.437 --> 52:22.030
Unbelievable.

52:23.006 --> 52:25.737
You don't have to be
so mean about it.

52:25.809 --> 52:28.802
I'm sorry,
did you say something?

52:31.882 --> 52:34.477
I said you don't have
to be so mean.

52:34.551 --> 52:37.316
Everybody's just trying
to do their best. Yeah?

52:37.387 --> 52:39.481
And what would you know
about it, Princess?

52:39.556 --> 52:42.151
Sloane, nobody's feeling
this number.

52:42.225 --> 52:44.490
Maybe we should try one of
Courtney's songs instead.

52:44.561 --> 52:46.427
Are you kidding me?

52:46.496 --> 52:48.522
A princess can't write songs!

52:48.598 --> 52:49.827
Says who?

52:50.500 --> 52:52.696
A good song can come
from anywhere.

52:53.236 --> 52:54.966
And from anyone.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.301
You write songs?

52:56.373 --> 52:57.864
She sure does.

52:57.941 --> 52:59.705
They're really good!

53:00.310 --> 53:01.744
Well, let's hear one, Princess.

53:01.811 --> 53:03.370
Oh, I don't know.

53:03.446 --> 53:04.505
Come on, Courtney.

53:04.648 --> 53:05.707
But which one?

53:05.782 --> 53:07.808
- The one we played this morning.
- Yeah.

53:07.884 --> 53:10.251
You have got to be kidding me.

53:10.320 --> 53:13.449
Creativity should always
be encouraged, Sloane.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.253
Judgment can wait.

53:23.266 --> 53:26.998
<i>I want to turn it
up so don't you turn me down</i>

53:27.070 --> 53:28.766
<i>'Cause when we get together</i>

53:28.838 --> 53:30.568
<i>We got a rockin' sound</i>

53:30.640 --> 53:34.475
<i>Don't need to follow
In somebody else's steps</i>

53:34.544 --> 53:36.376
<i>We make our own moves</i>

53:36.446 --> 53:38.005
<i>I think you know the rest</i>

53:40.150 --> 53:42.415
<i>Just look around now</i>

53:43.820 --> 53:45.755
<i>Look what you got now</i>

53:47.424 --> 53:49.620
<i>Find yourself in the song</i>

53:51.328 --> 53:54.856
<i>Bring out the beat
and the melody, melody</i>

53:54.931 --> 53:57.526
<i>Find yourself in the song</i>

53:58.868 --> 54:02.168
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

54:02.239 --> 54:08.475
<i>All it takes is one big dream</i>

54:08.878 --> 54:12.246
<i>You better find
yourself in the song</i>

54:13.817 --> 54:16.878
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

54:16.953 --> 54:18.216
<i>Yeah</i>

54:19.923 --> 54:21.255
This is insane!

54:21.758 --> 54:23.818
If you think we're going to
play a song by a princess...

54:23.893 --> 54:25.885
I'd say you'd win
the competition.

54:26.463 --> 54:29.331
You want to win,
don't you, Sloane?

54:29.399 --> 54:31.027
Yes.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.502
Great! Rock on,
everybody!

54:36.706 --> 54:38.641
Yes.
Yeah.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.143
<i>Everybody's got a voice</i>

54:49.219 --> 54:51.779
<i>So use it loud and clear</i>

54:51.855 --> 54:53.721
<i>Loud and clear</i>

54:53.790 --> 54:54.814
<i>Loud and clear</i>

54:54.891 --> 54:58.919
<i>Raise it up to the sky And tell
'em that we're here</i>

54:58.995 --> 55:01.123
<i>That we're here</i>

55:02.098 --> 55:04.658
<i>Gettin' ready for the ride</i>

55:04.734 --> 55:06.225
<i>Gettin' ready</i>

55:06.303 --> 55:09.831
<i>Show them what we've
got inside Yeah</i>

55:10.907 --> 55:12.967
<i>Oh, tonight</i>

55:13.043 --> 55:15.945
<i>Nothing is what it seems</i>

55:16.012 --> 55:17.241
<i>No</i>

55:18.448 --> 55:20.178
<i>Tonight</i>

55:20.250 --> 55:24.381
<i>Finding out what it means Yeah</i>

55:26.456 --> 55:28.425
<i>Life is a song</i>

55:28.491 --> 55:30.255
<i>We got the key</i>

55:30.327 --> 55:31.852
<i>Be who you are</i>

55:31.928 --> 55:33.453
<i>Unlock your dreams</i>

55:33.530 --> 55:35.294
<i>Tonight</i>

55:35.365 --> 55:39.666
<i>We're showing you what it means</i>

55:39.736 --> 55:42.535
<i>To unlock your dreams</i>

55:42.639 --> 55:44.471
<i>Unlock them</i>

55:44.541 --> 55:46.874
<i>You've got the key</i>

55:46.943 --> 55:49.276
<i>Unlock them</i>

55:50.180 --> 55:52.012
<i>Unlock them</i>

55:52.082 --> 55:54.313
<i>You've got the key</i>

55:54.384 --> 55:55.909
<i>Unlock them</i>

55:55.985 --> 55:57.248
<i>Tonight</i>

55:58.021 --> 56:01.822
<i>Nothing is what it seems No</i>

56:02.692 --> 56:05.252
Okay, that was better.

56:05.662 --> 56:08.154
But your harmonies have
got to be way tighter.

56:12.669 --> 56:15.104
Perhaps we're not the problem.

56:15.905 --> 56:17.601
Meaning what?

56:17.674 --> 56:19.404
There's something wrong
with the song?

56:19.709 --> 56:24.511
That and the fact that you've
given yourself every single solo,

56:24.581 --> 56:27.176
reducing the rest of us
into back-up singers.

56:29.452 --> 56:33.082
I'm sorry, Olivia,
but did you not hear what Lady Anne said?

56:33.156 --> 56:36.320
Camp Royalty needs my voice
to win the competition.

56:36.393 --> 56:38.919
It's a sing-off,
not a tea party.

56:38.995 --> 56:41.624
So maybe you should stick
to what you know

56:41.765 --> 56:44.428
and leave the music
to a professional?

56:44.768 --> 56:47.966
Perhaps it's slipped your mind,
but this camp is for royalty,

56:48.037 --> 56:49.733
and we don't need
some one-hit wonder

56:49.806 --> 56:52.298
telling us what to do
or how to do it!

56:53.443 --> 56:56.572
Fine. You wanna go down
in flames, be my guest!

56:57.947 --> 56:59.006
Oh, no!

56:59.149 --> 57:00.208
Come, quickly.

57:01.384 --> 57:03.012
Erika!

57:03.086 --> 57:04.816
Please don't walk away!

57:04.888 --> 57:06.550
Don't go!

57:07.757 --> 57:10.090
Erika, come back!

57:10.160 --> 57:11.651
Let's figure something out.

57:11.728 --> 57:14.061
Guys, Olivia's never
gonna listen.

57:14.130 --> 57:15.359
We'll talk to her.

57:15.432 --> 57:18.925
Although to be honest,
she does have a point.

57:19.903 --> 57:21.235
What!

57:21.304 --> 57:23.364
This sing-off
isn't just about you.

57:24.641 --> 57:27.873
I... I have to get out
of here.

57:37.921 --> 57:40.254
Hello? Anyone here?

57:51.234 --> 57:53.965
Come on, Eddie,
pick up, pick up!

57:54.604 --> 57:58.666
<i>Hey, rock 'n' roll is here to stay,
but I am out!</i>

57:58.808 --> 58:00.936
Oh, no, no.
Thank you, Lady Anne.

58:01.277 --> 58:04.372
I'm sure I'm not the
smartest man in the world.

58:04.447 --> 58:05.813
Top five maybe.

58:05.882 --> 58:07.475
You're too kind.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.154
Oh, poor Finn Oxford.

58:14.224 --> 58:16.489
What will you do
when you lose the sing-off

58:16.559 --> 58:18.551
and have to close
Camp Pop for good?

58:20.697 --> 58:23.758
Don't care! After all,
a bet's a bet!

58:23.833 --> 58:26.735
And Camp Royalty
has this in the bag!

58:28.171 --> 58:32.233
Of course, Lady Anne,
I'd love to have dinner with you tonight.

58:32.308 --> 58:34.368
Or may I call you Anne?

58:34.878 --> 58:37.541
<i>Love is in the air</i>

58:55.899 --> 58:57.492
Erika!

58:57.934 --> 58:58.958
Ooh!

58:59.035 --> 59:01.561
I knew you'd come
to your senses.

59:02.305 --> 59:03.796
Can't breathe.

59:04.874 --> 59:06.001
Sorry.

59:06.476 --> 59:09.742
Okay.
First, you were right.

59:09.812 --> 59:11.678
I let that stuff
Lady Anne said go to my head

59:11.748 --> 59:13.410
and made everything
all about me.

59:13.683 --> 59:16.118
So I'm really sorry about that.

59:16.185 --> 59:19.815
But second, you guys are not gonna
believe what I just found out!

59:19.889 --> 59:22.154
Camp Pop really
does have centaurs?

59:22.992 --> 59:24.483
Uh, no.

59:24.928 --> 59:25.952
Oh.

59:26.029 --> 59:28.658
Lady Anne made some kind
of bet with Camp Pop,

59:28.731 --> 59:31.860
and the loser has to shut down,
for good!

59:31.935 --> 59:34.097
Oh, no.
What if we lose?

59:34.170 --> 59:35.729
We can't let that happen.

59:35.805 --> 59:37.467
For either camp!

59:37.540 --> 59:41.033
So what do we do?
We can't both win.

59:41.110 --> 59:44.706
I have an idea.
But if it's gonna work, we'll need help.

59:47.150 --> 59:49.244
Look, there's the big piano.

59:51.321 --> 59:52.345
Cute.

59:52.488 --> 59:53.512
Come on.

59:55.858 --> 59:56.917
This way.

59:56.993 --> 59:59.360
- This is so exciting!
- Shh!

59:59.429 --> 01:00:01.330
It's like we're secret agents.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.278
Whoa!

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:18.807
Hello.

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:21.483
Hi.

01:00:22.018 --> 01:00:24.852
Erika, what are you doing here?

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:29.517
Long story, but the future of Camp
Royalty and Camp Pop is on the line.

01:00:34.597 --> 01:00:35.621
Ugh.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:37.792
Well, where is she?

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:40.200
Hey, everybody,
I have some news.

01:00:40.269 --> 01:00:43.262
This is Princess Aubray,
Princess Genevieve and...

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.531
Erika Juno!

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.538
How do they know...

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:49.738
I'll tell you later.

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:51.440
Hey, everybody.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.850
Everyone,
your attention, please!

01:00:58.921 --> 01:01:01.288
Since Erika is notably absent,

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:04.225
I have decided to continue
with our original number.

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.522
Hold on, Olivia.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:07.429
We have something to tell you.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:11.025
If we lose this sing-off,
Camp Royalty will close forever.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.534
What?
What can we do?

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.804
And the only one
who can save it...

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:17.164
Is all of us.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.732
Together, as a group.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:22.301
I see how important that is now.

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:25.075
But we'll need
your royal touch, Olivia.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.680
Truce?

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:34.488
Okay.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.288
So, what's going on?

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.125
Well, I went to
Lady Anne's office

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:42.165
to call my manager
and Clive came in...

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:45.093
So what do you think?
Can we do this?

01:01:45.168 --> 01:01:47.262
Yeah! For sure!
I'm in! Yeah, we can.

01:01:50.807 --> 01:01:52.469
Can I play lead guitar?

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.740
Was there ever a doubt?

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:57.745
Yeah, all right.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.017
So, let's get to work.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:52.462
Is that the best you've got?

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:54.861
Come on, let's hear it!

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.064
Welcome, one and all,

01:04:01.137 --> 01:04:05.404
to the first ever sing-off between
Camp Royalty and Camp Pop.

01:04:05.474 --> 01:04:08.467
Lady Anne, lovely as always,

01:04:08.544 --> 01:04:12.242
although that glare off those
veneers is blinding.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:15.944
Wish I'd worn my extra
dark sunglasses.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:18.885
So sweet.

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:21.049
Can you believe he's single?

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:23.251
You know,
I hear opposites attract.

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.955
Maybe you should find
someone funny.

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:33.025
Well then, let's introduce
the judges, shall we?

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:39.572
The reigning queen of pop music,
Allegra James!

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.408
Prince Reginald of Thistlebrook.

01:04:45.047 --> 01:04:47.812
And Svetlana Petranova,

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:51.048
headmistress of Camp Arabesque.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.189
Whoo!
Love you, Svetlana!

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:02.991
Now what do you say
we get this party started!

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:11.436
May I present to you the
Camp Royalty a cappella singers!

01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:37.225
<i>Everybody wants to
find out who they are for real</i>

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.401
<i>Looking for a way to show it</i>

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:44.997
<i>Tell you how I feel</i>

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.039
<i>A melody needs harmony</i>

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:53.913
<i>You've shown me
what a friend can be</i>

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.420
<i>Tonight</i>

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:02.219
<i>Nothing is what it seems</i>

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.855
Clive.
Where is my pizzazz?

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:09.831
I'm sure it's coming, Lady Anne.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.993
Good thing there's Plan B.

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:13.764
<i>Life is a song</i>

01:06:13.836 --> 01:06:15.464
<i>We got the key</i>

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.370
<i>Be who you are</i>

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:19.068
<i>Unlock your dreams</i>

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:20.905
<i>Tonight</i>

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.971
<i>We're showing you what it means</i>

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:27.846
<i>To unlock your dreams</i>

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:36.419
<i>I want to turn it up</i>

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.290
<i>So don't you turn me down</i>

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:40.330
<i>'Cause when we get together</i>

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:42.058
<i>We've got a rockin' sound</i>

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:45.898
<i>Don't need to follow in
Somebody else's steps</i>

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:49.769
<i>We make our own rules
I think you know the rest</i>

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.633
<i>Just look around now</i>

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.709
<i>Look what you got now</i>

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:01.440
<i>Find yourself in the song</i>

01:07:03.085 --> 01:07:06.214
<i>Bring out the beat
and the melody, melody</i>

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:08.780
<i>Find yourself in the song</i>

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.625
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:20.030
<i>All it takes is one big dream</i>

01:07:20.536 --> 01:07:23.870
<i>You better find
yourself in the song</i>

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:29.106
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be Yeah</i>

01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:32.637
<i>Bring out the beat
and the melody, melody</i>

01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:35.507
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.882
<i>Unlock your dreams</i>

01:07:36.952 --> 01:07:37.952
How dare they!

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:40.080
<i>Melody, melody</i>

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:43.459
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:44.960
<i>Yeah</i>

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:47.825
<i>Just look around now</i>

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.529
<i>Look what you got now</i>

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.193
<i>Tonight
Find yourself in the song</i>

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.137
<i>Nothing is what it seems</i>

01:07:57.206 --> 01:08:00.335
<i>Bring out the beat
and the melody, melody</i>

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.678
<i>Tonight
Find yourself in the song</i>

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.737
<i>We're finding out what it means</i>

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:07.750
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:13.088
<i>Life is a song, we got the key
All it takes is one big dream</i>

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.181
<i>Be who you are
Unlock your dreams</i>

01:08:15.257 --> 01:08:17.692
<i>You better find yourself
in the song Tonight</i>

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.319
<i>We're finding out what it means</i>

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:21.626
Sweet rock 'n' roll!

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.228
<i>Tonight
Find yourself in the song</i>

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:27.462
<i>Nothing is what it seems</i>

01:08:27.536 --> 01:08:30.335
<i>Bring out the beat
and the melody, melody</i>

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:33.133
Find a way to stop this at once!

01:08:33.209 --> 01:08:35.201
How?
I don't care!

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.643
Just do it!

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.203
<i>Meant to be</i>

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.910
<i>Life is a song, we got the key
All it takes is one big dream</i>

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.714
<i>Be who you are</i>

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.515
<i>Unlock your dreams</i>

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.682
<i>Tonight
Find yourself in the song</i>

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:49.691
<i>Finding out what it means</i>

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:52.125
<i>When we're together
it's meant to be</i>

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.787
<i>Unlock your dreams You and me</i>

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.456
<i>Yeah, you and me</i>

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:59.059
<i>Unlock our dreams</i>

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:12.578
No! No, no, no, no.

01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:14.046
Oh, sorry.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.549
You were amazing!

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.420
We were amazing.

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:31.796
That was spectacular,
but what're we supposed to do now?

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:35.929
How can we pick a winner if
both camps competed together?

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:38.804
My dear, I am equally flummoxed.

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:41.343
Surely there must be
some sort of protocol

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.912
to follow in the event
of such a predicament.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:45.743
The entire point
of any competition

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:48.214
is to declare
a winner and a loser!

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:51.685
Am I right, Miss Petranova?

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:54.781
By the way, love the necklace.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:57.053
It's absolutely stunning.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.995
No, we must vote!

01:10:00.796 --> 01:10:04.631
Never in my life have I
witnessed such a travesty!

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.001
Judges, I must insist you
disqualify Camp Pop immediately

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:11.768
and declare Camp Royalty
the victor.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.206
Disqualify?

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:14.869
On what grounds?

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:17.275
Vocal sabotage.

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:21.249
No doubt orchestrated
by Finn Oxford himself.

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:22.979
You are out of your mind!

01:10:23.052 --> 01:10:25.715
I had nothing to do with this!

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:27.017
Awkward.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.217
Please,
we both know you'd do anything

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.556
to get back at me
for ending our courtship!

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:34.119
Trust me, I call that a favor.

01:10:34.196 --> 01:10:37.530
My only regret was not
sending a thank you note!

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.833
Clive? Clive!

01:10:44.607 --> 01:10:47.372
Wow. That was a bold move,
Princess.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.672
Thanks!

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:49.871
Now what?

01:10:50.012 --> 01:10:51.105
Lady Anne?

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.308
Lady Anne!

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.010
Lady Anne?

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:58.382
Never fear!
I'll get you out of there!

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.690
Must you make that racket?

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:10.861
Oh, I'm sorry, is my trying to
break us out of here bothering you?

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:12.697
Oh, I hate to tell you, darling,

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.999
but you're not strong enough
to open a jar of jam,

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:17.232
let alone break out of anything!

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:23.008
What is taking them so long?

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.910
Not a clue.

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:27.347
Y'all don't think
they're actually gonna vote?

01:11:27.916 --> 01:11:29.316
Out of the question.

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:30.910
They can't!

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:31.986
Can they?

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:33.145
No way.

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.418
They couldn't possibly.

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:45.197
Why am I not surprised, eh?

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:48.028
You never did believe in me!

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:51.562
That's not true!
I always had faith in your talent.

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.769
If you thought I was so great,
then why'd you dump me?

01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.471
Because I knew
when you hit it big,

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:59.013
you would have run off
and left me behind!

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:03.117
Wait. You knew
I'd hit it big?

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:08.320
Yes. And that I'd never
fit into that life.

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:11.994
Rock and royalty
don't mix, Finn.

01:12:13.929 --> 01:12:16.524
There was always room for you
in my life, Annie.

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:19.430
There always has been.

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.802
Oh.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.311
May we have
everyone's attention!

01:12:32.381 --> 01:12:35.476
The judges have made
their decision.

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:42.324
After your somewhat unorthodox
but amazing performance,

01:12:42.391 --> 01:12:46.795
I've decided that I can't
possibly pick a winner.

01:12:46.862 --> 01:12:48.296
Nor can I.

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:53.093
I, however, can.

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.432
Camp Royalty is the victor!

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.711
We won!

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.447
We won, we won!

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:14.487
Well, we tried our best.

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:17.822
It totally stinks that we
couldn't save both camps.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.561
I suppose we should
let them out of there.

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:32.440
Oh.

01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:33.870
That's not right...

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:35.376
Ew.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:36.577
Aw.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:39.442
You're just saying that.

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:41.846
Am not.

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.317
Are too!

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:47.983
What happened?

01:13:48.056 --> 01:13:50.355
This magic is more
powerful than I thought.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.157
Lady Anne, did you hear?

01:13:53.362 --> 01:13:55.126
Victory is ours!

01:13:55.197 --> 01:13:57.132
Camp Royalty has won!

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.600
And Camp Pop is through!

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.432
Done! In your face!

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.431
Actually, Clive,
that's where you're wrong.

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.401
I'm sorry, what now?

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.946
The situation has changed.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.604
Uh...

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:15.412
Lady Anne,
perhaps you're disoriented,

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:18.113
maybe even a bit "woozy"
from your ordeal?

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:22.682
Because the judges
have made their decision.

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:25.821
I understand that, Clive.

01:14:25.894 --> 01:14:29.160
But Finn and I are
overruling that decision.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.894
What? No, you can't!

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:33.333
We can.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:36.634
As a result, we have a tie!

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.241
"Tie"?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:42.642
It means there's no winner.

01:14:42.711 --> 01:14:44.805
And no loser.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:47.247
So both camps are saved!

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.251
How could you do this to me?

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.082
To us?

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.386
And why are you
holding his hand?

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:58.086
It turns out rock
and royalty can mix.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.152
We let assumptions
about each other

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:02.988
keep us from having
something special,

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:05.398
and we pushed you
guys to take sides.

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.663
But those days are over.

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:10.137
Therefore, starting next summer,

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:12.902
our two camps
will merge into one,

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:17.606
creating a place that will
celebrate rock and royalty alike.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:21.473
No!

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:24.651
We were supposed to win!

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.382
Now, Clive.

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:28.447
I bribed a judge for you!

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.816
You! You!

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:33.224
What?

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:35.860
Nothing.
Which judge?

01:15:43.071 --> 01:15:44.596
Oh, Clive.

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:48.407
You might want to make
yourself scarce about now.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:50.140
No, no, no. I... No, no.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.578
The thing is, I mean...

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:53.309
No, you don't understand...

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.544
Lady Anne, I did it all for...

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:08.726
So, any plans for next summer?

01:16:08.797 --> 01:16:10.356
Going on tour?

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:14.597
Actually I think I'm done with the
whole pop star solo act thing.

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:16.130
Really?

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:18.537
Maybe you should start a band.

01:16:18.607 --> 01:16:20.007
Maybe I should.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.600
Know anyone?

01:16:21.677 --> 01:16:23.009
I sure do.

01:16:23.111 --> 01:16:24.704
Yes!
Yes, I am in!

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.625
Oh.

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:39.226
That was fun.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.331
Yes, well, anyway.

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:44.957
I knew it.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.229
Now all we need
is a killer name.

01:16:47.302 --> 01:16:51.034
How about "Rock 'n Royals"?

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:52.130
That's a great name.

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:53.505
Brilliant!
Love it!

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:55.002
Can't wait.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:56.236
Can't wait.

01:16:56.311 --> 01:16:57.677
Can't wait!

01:16:57.746 --> 01:16:59.544
One, two, three, four!

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:02.483
<i>Can't wait to jam by the lake</i>

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:05.779
<i>So many memories to make</i>

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.447
<i>Bet we'll be staying awake</i>

01:17:07.589 --> 01:17:09.182
<i>You will be staying awake</i>

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:11.158
<i>All night</i>

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:14.053
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:16.759
<i>Oh</i>

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:20.768
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:27.308
<i>Gotta, gotta, gotta get to camp</i>

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.320
<i>Okay</i>

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:42.857
<i>Now</i>

01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:45.851
<i>Sometimes you gotta shine</i>

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.727
<i>I spend too much time
thinking about</i>

01:17:50.799 --> 01:17:52.267
<i>Who I'm supposed to be</i>

01:17:53.602 --> 01:17:55.764
<i>I play by everybody else's rules</i>

01:17:55.837 --> 01:17:57.931
<i>That don't seem right to me</i>

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:01.973
<i>'Cause I'm cool
and polite on the outside</i>

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:05.407
<i>But when I get the chance
I just run and hide</i>

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.315
<i>But if your eyes are closed
Then it gets too hard to see</i>

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:13.110
<i>What if I get afraid</i>

01:18:14.122 --> 01:18:15.249
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

01:18:15.323 --> 01:18:17.883
<i>What if I just turn away</i>

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:20.719
<i>Don't just turn away</i>

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:24.164
<i>What if I hide my face</i>

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.696
<i>Don't you hide your face</i>

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.268
<i>What if I lose my breath,
my breath</i>

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:31.431
<i>But then I think, "Wait"</i>

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:35.907
<i>What if I shine, shine,
shine, shine, shine</i>

01:18:35.977 --> 01:18:37.969
<i>Shine, shine, shine</i>

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:41.483
<i>What if I shine, shine,
shine, shine, shine</i>

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.519
<i>Shine, shine, shine</i>

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:45.884
<i>What if I Should I even care</i>

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.081
<i>They're all sitting there</i>

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.885
<i>And everybody's staring at me</i>

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:52.553
<i>At me Maybe if I step
into the spotlight</i>

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.760
<i>I can be set free</i>

01:18:55.297 --> 01:18:58.461
<i>'Cause I'm cool
and polite on the outside</i>

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:01.697
<i>Outside But when I get the
chance I just run and hide</i>

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:06.074
<i>But if you never try Then
I guess you'll never see</i>

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:09.373
<i>What if I get afraid</i>

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:11.638
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.911
<i>What if I just turn away</i>

01:19:16.184 --> 01:19:17.243
<i>Don't just turn away</i>

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:20.949
<i>What if I hide my face</i>

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.152
<i>Don't you hide your face</i>

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.626
<i>What if I lose my breath,
my breath</i>

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:28.295
<i>But then I think, "Wait"</i>

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:32.159
<i>What if I shine, shine,
shine, shine, shine</i>

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.533
<i>Shine, shine, shine</i>

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.869
<i>What if I shine, shine,
shine, shine, shine</i>

01:19:37.939 --> 01:19:40.135
