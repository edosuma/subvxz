00:12.701 --> 00:16.267
I'm issuing an executive order,
imposing a curfew

00:16.334 --> 00:18.234
on all civilians

00:18.301 --> 00:20.634
in the Los Angeles
metropolitan area.

00:20.701 --> 00:22.434
This curfew will be effective

00:22.501 --> 00:25.534
immediately and will be enforced
by the military.

00:25.601 --> 00:26.867
They're talking about this

00:26.933 --> 00:28.200
like it's
an illegal action.

00:28.267 --> 00:30.367
Don't worry, Mr. President.

00:30.434 --> 00:32.534
I'm in control of the situation.

00:32.601 --> 00:34.067
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

00:34.134 --> 00:35.833
that he proposed this whole
thing to set you up for a fall?

00:35.900 --> 00:38.267
Hal's only motivation
is what's best for the country.

00:38.334 --> 00:39.668
There's going to be a fallout.

00:39.734 --> 00:41.034
And you know it.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.167
You're here to shut
this place down, aren't you?

00:43.234 --> 00:44.334
I told you before,
the White House...

00:44.401 --> 00:45.534
I know what you
told me before.

00:45.601 --> 00:48.000
Now tell me the truth.

00:48.067 --> 00:49.668
CTU is being absorbed
by Homeland,

00:49.734 --> 00:51.067
which means
from now on,

00:51.134 --> 00:53.234
every operational decision
needs to go through me.

00:53.301 --> 00:54.734
There's something
from my brother

00:54.800 --> 00:56.067
I need to give you personally.

00:56.134 --> 00:57.668
I should be there
within the hour.

00:57.734 --> 00:59.668
You coming here?
I know
it sounds impulsive, Aaron,

00:59.734 --> 01:01.534
but I'd rather see you
sooner than later.

01:01.601 --> 01:03.734
I'm hoping there's somewhere
we can meet discreetly.

01:07.933 --> 01:09.434
( tires squealing )

01:11.800 --> 01:13.933
( tires squealing )

01:20.534 --> 01:22.467
Does she have the schematics
and the access codes?

01:22.534 --> 01:25.100
Yes. Everything
we need.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.800
Release the Sentox here...

01:26.867 --> 01:29.701
and 200,000 people die.

01:29.768 --> 01:31.534
The decryption key
is Charlie-Alpha

01:31.601 --> 01:33.100
3-9-Alpha.

01:33.167 --> 01:35.401
It worked.

01:35.467 --> 01:36.734
This is what
you wanted.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.234
JACK:
Drop the gun!

01:38.301 --> 01:40.234
I'm with the German Federal
Intelligence Service.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.734
I've been undercover
for the last six months,

01:42.800 --> 01:44.534
gathering intel
on Collette's clientele.

01:44.601 --> 01:45.867
If we don't find Bierko,

01:45.933 --> 01:47.501
hundreds of thousands
of innocent people

01:47.567 --> 01:48.701
will die here today.

01:48.768 --> 01:50.100
JACK:
Let him go!

01:50.167 --> 01:51.000
He's given us what we want!

01:51.067 --> 01:52.434
Put your hands up!

01:53.634 --> 01:55.200
As for the data
I sold to Bierko,

01:55.267 --> 01:57.467
it's something that I received
from a contact

01:57.534 --> 01:58.634
from the Department
of Defense.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.800
What's his name?
Her name?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.434
Audrey Raines.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.900
You were lying to me.

02:04.967 --> 02:07.200
She sold me the
information, Mr. Bauer.

02:07.267 --> 02:09.601
Apparently, she
had a price.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.367
Chloe, I need you to do
something for me right away.

02:27.434 --> 02:28.534
Check out Audrey Raines's

02:28.601 --> 02:30.367
activities in the
last 18 months.

02:30.434 --> 02:31.601
Audrey? Why?

02:31.668 --> 02:32.967
I'll explain later.

02:33.034 --> 02:35.768
I'm particularly interested
in any unusual connection

02:35.833 --> 02:37.800
between her and Christopher
Henderson or Walt Cummings.

02:37.867 --> 02:40.334
You think she has something
to do with their conspiracy?

02:40.401 --> 02:42.501
I don't know what to think.
Please do it quickly.

02:45.334 --> 02:46.434
Audrey.

02:46.501 --> 02:47.734
Yes, sir?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.434
I'm afraid I have to
take you into custody.

02:49.501 --> 02:51.167
What? I don't understand.

02:51.234 --> 02:52.367
Am I being arrested?
Detained.

02:52.434 --> 02:53.701
On what grounds?

02:53.768 --> 02:56.100
Collette Stenger's been passing
information to Bierko,

02:56.167 --> 02:58.501
information he apparently
intends to use

02:58.567 --> 02:59.768
in his next attack.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.401
She claims
she got the information

03:01.467 --> 03:02.401
from someone at DoD,

03:02.467 --> 03:03.833
and she named you
as the source.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.267
She's lying.
That's impossible.

03:05.334 --> 03:06.434
We already uncovered one mole

03:06.501 --> 03:07.601
in the White House today,
Audrey.

03:07.668 --> 03:09.067
I have no choice.

03:09.134 --> 03:11.267
What kind of information
did Stenger say I gave her?

03:11.334 --> 03:13.434
I've told you as much
as I can at this point.

03:13.501 --> 03:16.401
Prep Ms. Raines
for interrogation.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.734
Does Jack know that
I'm being detained?
Yes.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.034
He sanctioned it.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.367
COLLETTE:
It's the truth.

03:25.434 --> 03:28.301
Audrey Raines was my contact
at the Department of Defense.

03:28.367 --> 03:30.701
You met with her
face-to-face?
Yes.

03:30.768 --> 03:32.534
Good, then you'll be able to
recognize her when you see her.

03:32.601 --> 03:34.434
Of course.
CTU AGENT:
She identified Ms. Raines

03:34.501 --> 03:36.334
from photographs
on the way here.

03:37.401 --> 03:39.234
If you were lying to me,

03:39.301 --> 03:41.768
I'm gonna make this
the worst day of your life.

03:41.833 --> 03:44.501
You understand?

03:44.567 --> 03:46.200
Put her in Holding.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.534
Burke's interrogation methods

04:12.601 --> 04:14.167
should only be used
as a last resort.

04:14.234 --> 04:16.367
The situation warrants
a more aggressive approach.

04:16.434 --> 04:18.200
Then do the same thing
to Collette Stenger.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.067
Stenger is protected
by an immunity agreement.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.534
We can't touch her
unless the information

04:21.601 --> 04:23.833
she's provided turns
out to be false;

04:23.900 --> 04:25.167
then we can nullify
the agreement.

04:25.234 --> 04:27.000
So we can torture
our own people,

04:27.067 --> 04:28.334
but we can't
touch a criminal?

04:28.401 --> 04:31.467
I've known Audrey Raines
for years.

04:31.534 --> 04:32.833
I trust her implicitly.

04:32.900 --> 04:34.100
So does everyone else.

04:34.167 --> 04:35.401
Maybe that's the problem.

04:35.467 --> 04:37.867
Bill, we don't have
the luxury of time.

04:37.933 --> 04:40.200
Intel indicates that
an attack is imminent--

04:40.267 --> 04:41.567
within an hour.

04:41.634 --> 04:43.401
Tens, maybe hundreds
of thousands of Americans

04:43.467 --> 04:45.701
are at risk,
and we just got information

04:45.768 --> 04:48.967
that Audrey Raines
knows about it.

04:49.034 --> 04:51.668
Karen, the decision
is yours.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.701
But any adverse consequences

04:53.768 --> 04:56.967
that result from insufficiently
aggressive action taken now

04:57.034 --> 04:59.000
will come down hard on you.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.301
What is Agent Burke doing here?

05:04.367 --> 05:06.034
KAREN:
We're talking about authorizing
the medical interrogation.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.267
On Audrey?
Yes.

05:07.334 --> 05:08.267
That's ridiculous.

05:08.334 --> 05:09.900
I'll handle
the interrogation.

05:09.967 --> 05:11.134
I can't allow that.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.534
Karen, I brought this to you.
I called it in.

05:12.601 --> 05:13.900
You can't pull me off
of this now.

05:13.967 --> 05:15.467
Your emotional involvement
with Ms. Raines

05:15.534 --> 05:16.668
is not exactly a secret, Jack.

05:16.734 --> 05:18.434
That has nothing
to do with this.

05:18.501 --> 05:20.501
That's right.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.833
You always put the work first.

05:22.900 --> 05:25.167
You never let your feelings
get involved.

05:25.234 --> 05:27.701
Is that what happened
with Nina Myers?

05:31.367 --> 05:34.301
Nina Myers was a mistake--
I've never denied that--

05:34.367 --> 05:35.634
but she was deep cover

05:35.701 --> 05:37.900
for years before
I even met her.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.668
She fooled a lot of people
for a long time, not just me.

05:40.734 --> 05:43.167
Well, maybe Audrey
is fooling people, too.

05:45.768 --> 05:47.833
You might be right, Karen,
but if I were you,

05:47.900 --> 05:49.200
I would think twice about

05:49.267 --> 05:51.534
who you're willing to
invasively interrogate.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.301
Audrey Raines is
the senior advisor

05:53.367 --> 05:55.467
to the Secretary of
Defense, James Heller,

05:55.534 --> 05:57.467
who happens to be her father!

05:57.534 --> 05:58.701
And if you were wrong,

05:58.768 --> 06:01.867
he's gonna eat you alive.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.668
At least let Jack talk to her
for ten minutes first.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.701
She deserves that much.

06:12.768 --> 06:15.167
If she's guilty...

06:15.234 --> 06:17.000
she doesn't deserve anything.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.000
That's the point.

06:18.067 --> 06:19.634
She hasn't
been proven guilty.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.167
After she's been prepped, you
can see her for ten minutes.

06:25.234 --> 06:27.467
But at the first sign
you're less than objective,

06:27.534 --> 06:29.100
you're out.

06:31.134 --> 06:33.034
Understood.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.067
Thanks, Bill.

06:47.134 --> 06:48.401
I don't believe
Audrey is guilty

06:48.467 --> 06:49.401
of anything, Jack.

06:49.467 --> 06:50.634
Neither do I.

06:50.701 --> 06:51.933
The one thing we do know is,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.768
Bierko is going
to release the Sentox

06:53.833 --> 06:55.567
in the city sometime
in the next hour.

06:55.634 --> 06:57.967
If Audrey knows anything
that can help us find him,

06:58.034 --> 06:59.734
she needs to tell us now.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.867
Keep an eye on the
traffic patrol.

07:01.933 --> 07:03.900
Bierko's gonna need to
move those canisters.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.100
He's gonna need
transportation.

07:05.167 --> 07:06.734
With the curfew in place,
I might get lucky

07:06.800 --> 07:07.734
and pick up a trail.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.100
Yeah.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.134
( man groans )
( siren whoops )

07:14.200 --> 07:16.734
( grunts and groans )

07:16.800 --> 07:19.267
( scuffling )

07:19.334 --> 07:21.601
Hey, break it up!

07:21.668 --> 07:22.601
( man groans )

07:22.668 --> 07:23.567
OFFICER:
Break it up now!

07:23.634 --> 07:26.701
Gentlemen, I said, break it up!

07:34.967 --> 07:36.301
( gunshot )

07:37.434 --> 07:40.100
Take their uniforms and weapons.

07:42.401 --> 07:44.668
Now we have a police
escort to the target,

07:44.734 --> 07:46.768
the curfew won't
be a problem.

08:13.367 --> 08:15.534
( whispering ):
Chloe, walk with me.

08:15.601 --> 08:17.800
You were doing background
on Audrey?

08:17.867 --> 08:18.967
Yeah.

08:19.034 --> 08:20.634
What have you got?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.501
You're not going to like it.

08:22.567 --> 08:25.467
I found the connection between
Walt Cummings and Audrey.

08:25.534 --> 08:27.634
What kind of a connection?

08:27.701 --> 08:29.034
They dealt with each other
a few times--

08:29.100 --> 08:30.900
the usual stuff between DoD
and the White House.

08:30.967 --> 08:33.467
But there is something else.

08:33.534 --> 08:34.933
What?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.799
Chloe, what?

08:37.866 --> 08:40.799
They both stayed at a place
called the River Hotel

08:40.866 --> 08:42.433
in Pikesville,
Maryland,
last April.

08:42.501 --> 08:43.799
So?

08:43.866 --> 08:45.234
So, Pikesville isn't
exactly a hot spot

08:45.301 --> 08:47.267
with top-ranking
federal officials.

08:47.334 --> 08:49.301
It wasn't a coincidence
that they were there
the same night.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.634
Chloe, what are you
trying to say?

08:51.701 --> 08:53.768
They didn't just stay
in the same hotel,

08:53.833 --> 08:55.467
but they stayed
in the same room.

08:55.534 --> 08:59.334
How could you
possibly know that?

08:59.401 --> 09:03.768
Because I e-mailed photos
of them to the manager.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.167
He recognized them both.

09:05.234 --> 09:07.768
He showed me phone bills,
room service receipts.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.833
I can show you a few
if you want.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.933
No. I'm sorry.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.301
I believe you.

09:23.701 --> 09:25.634
It doesn't mean she was part
of their conspiracy,

09:25.701 --> 09:28.334
but it doesn't exactly
look that good either.

09:31.434 --> 09:33.367
Make copies of everything
you've got

09:33.434 --> 09:34.701
and put them in a folder for me.

09:34.768 --> 09:36.267
Thanks.

10:16.234 --> 10:19.334
Excuse me.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.468
My name is Shari Rothenberg.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.867
I work in Section Five
downstairs.

10:22.934 --> 10:24.800
I know where Section Five is.

10:24.867 --> 10:28.434
Right. Uh, Mr. Buchanan told me
to report to Chloe O'Brian.

10:28.500 --> 10:29.767
Is that you?

10:29.834 --> 10:32.001
You're gonna have
to wait a second.

10:32.067 --> 10:34.134
Um, I'm here to replace Edgar.

10:34.201 --> 10:37.001
I understand he died
in the attack.

10:37.067 --> 10:38.834
Yes, he did.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.201
Well, if he was
a friend of yours,

10:41.267 --> 10:42.967
I'm sorry.

10:43.034 --> 10:45.301
( sighs )

10:47.167 --> 10:48.900
Thanks.

10:48.967 --> 10:50.600
He worked at Station Six.

10:50.667 --> 10:52.167
It's right there.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.667
Are you familiar

10:53.734 --> 10:54.934
with the Gavilan
matrix analyzer?

10:55.001 --> 10:56.500
Yes, I am.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.800
Use it to make sure
our databases are current.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.134
Some of them may have
fallen behind in the
past couple of hours.

11:01.201 --> 11:03.134
No problem.

11:03.201 --> 11:04.600
( sighs )

11:08.034 --> 11:09.533
( phone ringing musical tones )

11:18.533 --> 11:19.700
Jack.

11:19.767 --> 11:20.967
Sit down.

11:22.700 --> 11:24.600
Sit down.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.834
That's the dossier you gave me
on Collette Stenger.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.700
She says that you provided her
with information

11:36.767 --> 11:37.967
from the DoD.

11:38.034 --> 11:39.500
I know. Bill told me.
That's ridiculous.

11:39.567 --> 11:41.368
You know it.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.500
Jack, you're wasting time
that we don't have.

11:43.567 --> 11:45.001
I had to ask CTU

11:45.067 --> 11:47.067
so that I could
interrogate you.

11:47.134 --> 11:49.067
I have a job to do.
If I don't do it,

11:49.134 --> 11:50.434
Burke will, and I promise you,

11:50.500 --> 11:53.700
you do not want to see him
walk through that door.

11:53.767 --> 11:54.967
Fine.

11:55.034 --> 11:56.468
What kind of information
did she say I gave her?

11:56.533 --> 11:59.001
She said you provided her
with a structural schematic

11:59.067 --> 12:00.034
of Bierko's next target.

12:00.101 --> 12:01.301
What kind of structure?

12:01.368 --> 12:02.834
She didn't know.
She just delivered the package.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.401
She claims
that I gave her information,

12:05.468 --> 12:06.900
yet she can't tell you

12:06.967 --> 12:09.001
what that information is,
and that's enough

12:09.067 --> 12:10.468
to make me a suspect?!

12:10.533 --> 12:12.834
Damn it, Audrey! You know
what this nerve gas does?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.301
They are planning
another attack.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.134
We will not ignore any leads.

12:17.201 --> 12:20.234
I have nothing to do
with these terrorists.

12:20.301 --> 12:21.368
How did Collette Stenger

12:21.434 --> 12:22.334
get your name?

12:22.401 --> 12:23.600
I don't know.

12:23.667 --> 12:25.001
My father is
the Secretary of Defense.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.567
I'm an easy target.
Maybe she's trying

12:26.633 --> 12:28.934
to use him or embarrass him.

12:29.001 --> 12:31.134
Is he involved?

12:35.734 --> 12:38.900
Oh, Jack, you know him
better than that.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.600
You worked with him.

12:41.667 --> 12:43.867
He would never do anything
outside the law,

12:43.934 --> 12:45.034
and neither would I.

12:49.334 --> 12:51.600
The two men that we know
are part of the conspiracy

12:51.667 --> 12:53.134
are Walt Cummings and
Christopher Henderson.

12:53.201 --> 12:54.867
Have you had any
contact with these men?

12:57.167 --> 12:59.234
Christopher Henderson.

12:59.301 --> 13:01.967
I have never heard...
I'd never heard of him

13:02.034 --> 13:03.067
before today

13:03.134 --> 13:05.167
and, um...

13:05.234 --> 13:08.567
Walt Cummings I-I have met
a couple of times, yes.

13:08.633 --> 13:11.633
Where?

13:11.700 --> 13:12.967
Um, DoD briefings.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.167
That's it?

13:14.234 --> 13:15.667
Yes.

13:18.700 --> 13:19.967
Are you sure?

13:20.034 --> 13:21.368
Yes, I'm sure.

13:27.034 --> 13:28.267
Open it.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.301
The River Hotel,
Pikesville, last April.

13:40.368 --> 13:41.267
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:41.334 --> 13:42.700
Um... We happened

13:42.767 --> 13:44.134
to be there at the same time.

13:44.201 --> 13:45.967
We may have had
a drink or two together.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.401
You weren't having
drinks with him.

13:47.468 --> 13:50.101
You shared a room with him.
You slept with him.

13:53.667 --> 13:54.867
Yes.

13:58.001 --> 14:01.167
I was still recovering
from losing you, Jack.

14:01.234 --> 14:04.800
He, uh...

14:04.867 --> 14:07.834
He had just separated
from his wife,

14:07.900 --> 14:10.767
and I slept with him once
and then I broke it off.

14:10.834 --> 14:12.167
Why'd you break it off?

14:12.234 --> 14:13.633
Jack, please, it's complicated.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.234
Why did you break it off?!

14:21.034 --> 14:23.600
Because he wasn't you.

14:31.034 --> 14:32.334
Why did you lie to me

14:32.401 --> 14:35.001
when I asked you
the first time?

14:35.067 --> 14:37.900
'Cause I, I was...

14:40.034 --> 14:42.201
I was afraid
that you'd think less of me,

14:42.267 --> 14:44.468
that you wouldn't
be able to forgive me.

14:44.533 --> 14:46.734
Because you slept with someone
after you thought I was dead?

14:46.800 --> 14:47.967
Because I slept with someone

14:48.034 --> 14:49.700
who turned out
to be a traitor, Jack.

14:59.034 --> 15:01.468
Is that the only time
you spent with Cummings?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.334
Yes.
Did he ever
talk to you

15:03.401 --> 15:05.368
about a terrorist attack,
nerve gas?
No.

15:05.434 --> 15:07.533
He ever mention
Christopher Henderson?
No.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.934
Damn it, Audrey!

15:09.001 --> 15:10.034
Jack, I... Jack!

15:10.101 --> 15:11.067
Tell me the truth!

15:11.134 --> 15:13.067
I am telling
you the t...

15:13.134 --> 15:14.967
You've already
lied to me once.

15:15.034 --> 15:17.034
You tell me what you
know, or I promise you

15:17.101 --> 15:18.533
this will become
very unpleasant.

15:20.201 --> 15:21.001
I'm telling you
everything.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.368
All right.

15:25.434 --> 15:26.633
Do what you have to do.

15:26.700 --> 15:29.900
Damn it, Audrey.
Tell me the truth!

15:29.967 --> 15:34.034
Jack. I am telling you
the truth, I swear.

15:39.034 --> 15:40.567
This is over!

15:40.633 --> 15:42.533
You understand? This is over!

15:44.167 --> 15:45.533
If you ask me,
she broke him

15:45.600 --> 15:46.767
and not the
other way around.

15:46.834 --> 15:47.767
Karen.

15:47.834 --> 15:49.468
He didn't push her hard enough,

15:49.533 --> 15:50.633
and you know it.
He's protecting her.

15:50.700 --> 15:51.734
She's innocent.

15:51.800 --> 15:53.734
We have to be certain.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.800
I am certain.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.301
Jack is certain.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.234
Well, I'm not.

16:00.301 --> 16:01.267
Karen.

16:01.334 --> 16:02.567
Send Burke in.

16:02.633 --> 16:04.600
I have to do this, Bill.
I can't waste

16:04.667 --> 16:06.201
any more time, and
make sure that Jack

16:06.267 --> 16:07.434
doesn't interfere.

16:13.334 --> 16:14.500
Okay, I'll pass that on.

16:14.567 --> 16:16.734
Shari. That was

16:16.800 --> 16:18.134
the agent
at Bierko's safe house.

16:18.201 --> 16:19.700
The place is empty.

16:19.767 --> 16:23.134
Forensics is still looking, but
they don't expect to find much.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.434
Upload that information
onto the subnets.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.234
Oh. Right.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.834
I checked your file.

16:34.900 --> 16:38.234
You're not qualified
for Level Three work,

16:38.301 --> 16:41.167
and that is not a Three.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.434
I'm provisionally qualified.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.167
It's all in my
supplemental file. Go ahead

16:44.234 --> 16:46.633
and check it
if you want.

16:46.700 --> 16:48.267
All right, Shari.

16:52.667 --> 16:56.101
First mistake, I yank
the provisional

16:56.167 --> 16:57.267
and you're out of here.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.733
What's with him?

17:05.800 --> 17:07.434
Two years ago
we both worked

17:07.500 --> 17:09.067
in the San Francisco office.

17:09.134 --> 17:11.599
There was a sexual
harassment thing.

17:11.666 --> 17:12.834
Miles?

17:12.900 --> 17:14.233
It was subtle at first,

17:14.300 --> 17:15.900
and then it
got really bad.

17:15.967 --> 17:17.468
Finally filed
a grievance.

17:17.532 --> 17:19.434
What happened?

17:19.500 --> 17:22.166
He got off
with a warning.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.599
These things are
really hard to prove.

17:23.666 --> 17:24.834
They said we
didn't have

17:24.900 --> 17:26.967
enough evidence
to go to trial.

17:27.034 --> 17:28.500
I can't get
into any details.

17:28.567 --> 17:29.633
The file is sealed.

17:29.700 --> 17:32.700
Don't worry.
I don't need details.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.167
But I guess I'd better
not make any mistakes.

17:35.234 --> 17:37.034
Yeah.

17:40.034 --> 17:41.533
What's going on?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.533
I'm sorry. This is
out of my control.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.900
Karen wants
to push Audrey

17:44.967 --> 17:46.101
a little harder.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.834
No, her interrogation
is over.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.167
Jack, I'll try to stall her
as long as I can.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.734
Jack, I have orders

17:51.800 --> 17:54.267
to take Miss Raines to Holding
for further interrogation.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.767
I don't care about your orders.
That's not gonna happen.

17:58.301 --> 17:59.633
Get out of my way.

18:01.301 --> 18:02.734
Get out of my way.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.034
Jack, stop it!
Jack, don't make this
any harder than it is.

18:06.101 --> 18:07.201
( taser buzzing )

18:07.267 --> 18:09.867
AUDREY:
Stop it, Jack! Stop it! Jack!

18:09.934 --> 18:11.101
Bill, do something!

18:11.167 --> 18:13.134
Bill!

18:14.600 --> 18:16.001
Bill!

18:33.534 --> 18:35.000
Hello.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.100
Mr. Henderson, it's Brennan.

18:37.167 --> 18:38.601
Is Wayne Palmer dead yet?

18:38.667 --> 18:40.501
No.
Explain.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.467
We rolled his car, but
he survived and got away.

18:43.534 --> 18:44.467
It was sloppy work.

18:44.534 --> 18:45.434
We'll make it right.

18:45.501 --> 18:46.701
Well, you damn well better.

18:46.767 --> 18:47.734
You know what's at stake.

18:47.801 --> 18:50.133
Yes, sir.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.367
PALMER:
This is Wayne Palmer.

18:52.434 --> 18:54.434
At the tone, leave a message.

19:03.634 --> 19:05.434
Steve, has Wayne Palmer
come through a checkpoint

19:05.501 --> 19:06.901
within the last half hour?

19:06.968 --> 19:09.067
Yeah, he was cleared through
Checkpoint 6 30 minutes ago.

19:09.133 --> 19:10.400
What, he's not here yet?

19:10.467 --> 19:13.067
No, he's not, and I can't
reach him on his cell.

19:13.133 --> 19:14.934
If you're worried, I
can send out an alert.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.434
No.

19:16.501 --> 19:19.534
Actually, he kind of wanted to
keep his visit under the radar.

19:19.601 --> 19:22.234
I think I'm going to go out
there and take a look myself,

19:22.300 --> 19:24.133
in case he had car trouble
or something.

19:24.200 --> 19:25.100
Do me a favor.

19:25.167 --> 19:26.901
Keep this between us,
would you?

19:26.968 --> 19:27.901
Yes, sir.

19:27.968 --> 19:28.968
Thanks.

19:34.334 --> 19:36.868
Thanks.

19:36.934 --> 19:38.601
KAREN:
You need to
calm down, Jack,

19:38.667 --> 19:39.968
and remember
who's in charge.

19:40.033 --> 19:41.434
Audrey Raines is innocent.

19:41.501 --> 19:43.267
She slept with a known
conspirator and lied about it.

19:43.334 --> 19:44.300
That doesn't concern you?

19:44.367 --> 19:45.667
She slept with him once

19:45.734 --> 19:47.133
and lied about it
because she was embarrassed.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.167
That hardly makes her

19:48.234 --> 19:49.534
part of this conspiracy.

19:49.601 --> 19:51.467
Why did Collette Stenger
name her as the source?

19:51.534 --> 19:53.067
She must have gotten
Audrey's name from Henderson.

19:53.133 --> 19:56.133
Why would Henderson want
to implicate Audrey?

19:56.200 --> 19:58.667
Henderson doesn't want
to implicate Audrey.

19:58.734 --> 19:59.968
He's coming after me.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.367
He's trying to make me
lose focus.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.133
And he's trying
to pull you off target.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
And he's done it.
These plans must
have been made

20:05.267 --> 20:06.968
some time ago, when Henderson
had every reason to believe

20:07.033 --> 20:07.968
you were gonna be killed.

20:08.033 --> 20:09.467
Karen, listen to me.

20:09.534 --> 20:11.133
This is what I do for a living.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.901
And the first rule
of engagement

20:12.968 --> 20:14.501
is that you have
a contingency plan.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.200
And this is his,
and it's working.

20:17.267 --> 20:18.634
You're getting ready
to interrogate Audrey Raines

20:18.701 --> 20:20.567
when you should be
interrogating Collette Stenger,

20:20.634 --> 20:22.834
because she still has
information that we don't have!

20:22.901 --> 20:24.100
Stenger has immunity.

20:24.167 --> 20:25.367
She's being protected

20:25.434 --> 20:27.100
by a federal marshal.
That's your doing, Jack.

20:27.167 --> 20:28.467
You made that deal!

20:28.534 --> 20:30.000
I know.

20:30.067 --> 20:31.634
But if I can prove
that Collette Stenger

20:31.701 --> 20:33.100
is withholding information
from us,

20:33.167 --> 20:34.400
that act alone

20:34.467 --> 20:36.067
negates her deal.

20:36.133 --> 20:37.801
I'll be able to start
questioning her again.

20:37.868 --> 20:38.968
She will give me Henderson.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.601
And once I have Henderson,
he will lead us

20:40.667 --> 20:42.033
to the nerve gas,
and that's what

20:42.100 --> 20:44.234
we're supposed to be
focused on!

20:44.300 --> 20:45.734
What are you suggesting
we do, Jack?

20:45.801 --> 20:50.334
Let me and Chloe find proof that
Collette Stenger is lying to us.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.267
If we don't,
you lose nothing.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.701
But if we do, we can
stop this thing from happening,

20:55.767 --> 20:56.767
I promise you.

20:57.834 --> 21:00.634
Karen, please.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.734
Excuse me.

21:13.801 --> 21:15.367
These matrix sweeps

21:15.434 --> 21:17.133
are partials only.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.200
Where's the rest of the data?

21:19.267 --> 21:21.133
I thought matrix data
could be sent unfiltered.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.234
That's not protocol.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.767
I thought it was
all right in house.

21:24.834 --> 21:27.501
Only if it's authorized.

21:27.567 --> 21:28.501
Who authorized it?

21:28.567 --> 21:30.200
I did.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.667
She did it under
my authority.

21:31.734 --> 21:34.801
I take full responsibility.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.534
I don't believe you.

21:37.601 --> 21:39.033
Believe what you want.

21:39.100 --> 21:41.334
That would be sloppy, O'Brian.

21:41.400 --> 21:43.667
You don't work
like that.

21:45.701 --> 21:48.434
She told you about my alleged
sexual harassment, right?

21:50.567 --> 21:52.234
Well, she's lying.
Listen...
No, you listen.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.767
There are 17 canisters of
nerve gas about to be deployed

21:54.834 --> 21:56.634
somewhere in Los Angeles, and
we're trying to find them.

21:56.701 --> 21:58.067
If you interrupt our work

21:58.133 --> 22:01.200
one more time, I'll file
a complaint with Division.

22:01.267 --> 22:03.367
Then you'll see what
protocol's all about.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.300
Thank you.

22:27.267 --> 22:29.968
Chloe, we need to help Audrey.
We don't have much time.

22:30.033 --> 22:32.000
How?
We need to find
the connection

22:32.067 --> 22:33.501
between Collette Stenger
and Henderson.

22:33.567 --> 22:36.100
We found Collette's name
on Henderson's computer.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.601
It's not enough.
We need proof that they had

22:38.667 --> 22:40.133
direct contact,
preferably more than once.

22:40.200 --> 22:42.300
You think Henderson gave
Collette Audrey's name?

22:42.367 --> 22:44.534
I'm sure of it. I want you
to use outside agencies,

22:44.601 --> 22:46.534
including foreign.
Put it on a priority channel.

22:46.601 --> 22:48.634
I'm on it.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.133
We have an
important delivery.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.000
There's no delivery scheduled.

23:02.067 --> 23:04.634
I'm gonna need to call this in.

23:04.701 --> 23:05.701
( gunshots )

23:13.267 --> 23:16.234
Stay out here
and watch the perimeter.

24:01.901 --> 24:04.734
( indistinct conversation )

24:05.934 --> 24:07.534
Who's in charge?

24:07.601 --> 24:08.767
I am.

24:08.834 --> 24:10.200
We need access

24:10.267 --> 24:12.267
to the control room.
Can you take us there?

24:12.334 --> 24:14.067
What are you guys doing here?

24:17.834 --> 24:19.200
Can you take us
to the control room?

24:19.267 --> 24:21.767
Yeah. It's that way.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.267
Good.

24:23.334 --> 24:25.701
Keep cooperating and no more
of your friends will die.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.300
Do you understand?
Yes.

24:27.367 --> 24:30.033
Mikhail, take the canisters
to the main distribution tank.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.734
Quickly!

24:35.801 --> 24:38.234
( steam hissing )

24:42.000 --> 24:43.767
This is it.

24:53.067 --> 24:56.000
Don't move.
Hands away from the console.

24:57.534 --> 24:59.400
Sam, what's going on?

24:59.467 --> 25:02.167
Ah, Sam... I'm not an engineer,
but I know enough,

25:02.234 --> 25:05.801
so you'd be wise not to try
to deceive me.

25:05.868 --> 25:08.234
What we're doing here
is very simple.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.601
We're going to release
a certain substance

25:10.667 --> 25:12.901
so that it flows
into your pipelines.

25:12.968 --> 25:14.300
What kind of substance?

25:14.367 --> 25:18.033
That's not your concern.
But at the pressure

25:18.100 --> 25:20.834
which currently prevails
in these pipes, the substance

25:20.901 --> 25:22.634
will react chemically
with the gas

25:22.701 --> 25:24.033
and become inert.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.267
So I need the pressure reduced

25:26.334 --> 25:28.868
by about 50%.
Sam, don't do it.

25:34.067 --> 25:35.968
Do you understand what I want?

25:36.033 --> 25:38.934
You want PSI cut by half.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.834
Exactly.

25:41.901 --> 25:43.801
And how long will it take?

25:43.868 --> 25:45.701
Could take an hour.

25:45.767 --> 25:49.467
You don't seem to care very much
for your friends, do you, Sam?

25:49.534 --> 25:50.634
No, no, don't!

25:50.701 --> 25:54.334
I might be able to do it
in 30 minutes.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.334
You have 15.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.667
Better get started.

26:27.267 --> 26:28.868
PALMER:
Don't move!

26:30.734 --> 26:33.033
Drop the gun.
Now!

26:37.033 --> 26:39.501
Move away from it.

26:48.367 --> 26:51.067
Now get on your knees.

26:52.267 --> 26:55.534
Mr. Palmer.

26:55.601 --> 26:57.967
It's Aaron.

26:58.033 --> 26:59.900
Oh, God.

27:01.100 --> 27:03.033
Aaron, what are you
doing out here?

27:03.100 --> 27:04.434
I was looking for you, sir.

27:04.501 --> 27:07.534
So are some other people.
Let's go.

27:10.501 --> 27:12.100
( gasps )

27:12.167 --> 27:14.067
BURKE:
Ms. Raines, we know you
conspired with Mr. Cummings.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.367
I didn't.

27:15.434 --> 27:18.667
Who else in the White House
was involved?

27:18.734 --> 27:19.868
I don't know.

27:19.933 --> 27:21.367
You know, Ms. Raines.

27:21.434 --> 27:22.900
I don't have... have any names.

27:22.967 --> 27:25.501
You're gonna
give me a name...
I swear I don't know, I...

27:25.567 --> 27:27.501
We don't have the time,
Ms. Raines.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.267
Give me a name!

27:29.334 --> 27:31.967
I don't... I swear.
I don't know.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.834
Chloe, what have you got?

27:35.900 --> 27:38.567
I found some masked entries in
Collette Stenger's cell phone.

27:38.634 --> 27:40.667
The decryption program...
Come on, Chloe.

27:40.734 --> 27:42.868
Bottom line: Henderson placed
eight cell phone calls

27:42.933 --> 27:45.634
to Collette Stenger
within the past three months.
Where's Collette Stenger now?

27:45.701 --> 27:47.100
Holding Room 3.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.768
Bill, we have a connection

27:48.834 --> 27:51.000
between Henderson
and Collette Stinger.
She received eight calls

27:51.067 --> 27:53.534
from him that she
didn't tell us about.
That voids her agreement.

27:53.601 --> 27:55.801
It's off.
That's for
the president to decide.

27:55.868 --> 27:58.567
Call the president!
You need a rescinding order
to question her, Jack.

27:58.634 --> 28:00.667
Get him to back off of Audrey!

28:02.000 --> 28:04.067
Get me the president.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.567
What's your connection
with Christopher Henderson?

28:17.634 --> 28:20.267
I have an immunity agreement
signed by your president.

28:20.334 --> 28:22.434
She's right.
She can't be
questioned.
We have proof

28:22.501 --> 28:24.868
that she withheld information.
Her deal's been rescinded.
The order's on its way.

28:24.967 --> 28:27.534
When it gets here,
she's all yours.
An innocent woman is being

28:27.601 --> 28:30.601
interrogated because of her.
Look, I'm sorry, sir,
but  you have to go.

28:32.933 --> 28:34.967
We know you lied to us.

28:35.033 --> 28:37.933
We know that you did not get the
schematics from Audrey Raines.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.734
Henderson told you to
use her name in case you
got in trouble, right?

28:45.768 --> 28:47.900
You do not want to try me.

28:50.801 --> 28:52.634
Yes.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.033
He tell you why?

28:59.434 --> 29:00.801
No.

29:00.868 --> 29:02.634
He's using you.

29:02.701 --> 29:05.634
He wanted you to get
inside my head.

29:05.701 --> 29:07.167
It worked.

29:07.234 --> 29:10.967
Now I'm... upset.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.167
You have three seconds to
tell me where the target is,

29:14.234 --> 29:16.801
or I will kill you.

29:16.868 --> 29:19.868
Where's the target?!

29:19.933 --> 29:22.100
A natural gas
distribution center.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.900
There are dozens of those
in the city. Which one?

29:24.967 --> 29:27.267
I don't know.
I swear.

29:27.334 --> 29:28.534
( hammer cocking )

29:32.167 --> 29:34.734
I don't know.
I don't.

29:48.367 --> 29:49.967
Jack, what's going on?
Bierko's targeting

29:50.033 --> 29:52.801
a natural gas
distribution center,
but we don't know which one.

29:52.868 --> 29:55.401
Natural gas?
He can use it as a delivery
system for the Sentox.

29:55.467 --> 29:57.768
He can get it
into people's homes.

29:57.834 --> 29:59.734
I need you to get Chloe on it.
We need to find out which one.

29:59.801 --> 30:02.100
Right. The rescinding
order will be here
in 15 minutes.

30:02.167 --> 30:05.768
Good. Give it to the marshal.
He'll be looking for this, too.

30:06.801 --> 30:08.367
Please, no more.
I'm begging you.

30:08.434 --> 30:11.334
Please. Don't do
that. Please...

30:11.401 --> 30:13.067
( sobbing )

30:13.134 --> 30:15.834
Please. I'm telling
you the truth.

30:15.900 --> 30:18.701
You're bringing this
on yourself.
( screams )No!

30:18.768 --> 30:21.134
Stop it! Make him...
This can end whenever
you want it to...

30:21.200 --> 30:22.367
Let her go!

30:22.434 --> 30:24.534
Shut it down now!
Jack!

30:24.601 --> 30:27.634
You are finished in here.
She is innocent.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.933
You can confirm it
with Buchanan.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
I said you're finished.

30:31.067 --> 30:32.667
Get out!

30:35.467 --> 30:37.434
Audrey, are you all right?
I don't know.

30:37.501 --> 30:40.067
It's over.

30:40.134 --> 30:41.933
I promise you,
it's over for good.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.200
My God, what's happening to me?
What's happening?

30:45.267 --> 30:48.033
( moans )
Henderson set you up...

30:48.100 --> 30:49.868
to get at me, to throw me
off his trail.

30:49.933 --> 30:52.100
Come here.

30:52.167 --> 30:54.868
I'm so sorry.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.734
Jack, the only thing
that got me through this...

31:04.801 --> 31:07.334
was knowing that you would come.

31:07.401 --> 31:09.534
I knew you would come.

31:23.100 --> 31:24.601
I'm so sorry.

31:24.667 --> 31:26.667
( sniffles )

31:26.734 --> 31:30.200
( cell phone rings )

31:32.967 --> 31:34.334
Bauer.

31:34.401 --> 31:36.067
Jack, it's Bill. We need you.

31:36.134 --> 31:38.434
Go.

31:38.501 --> 31:40.267
Jack?

31:40.334 --> 31:41.434
I'll be right there.

31:41.501 --> 31:43.200
Yep.
Bill, I want you to send someone

31:43.267 --> 31:46.267
over from medical
to Interrogation 1 to
tend to Audrey Raines.

31:46.334 --> 31:47.300
Okay.

31:47.367 --> 31:49.434
Thanks.

31:58.300 --> 32:01.000
Gonna be all right?

32:03.134 --> 32:04.834
Go. It's okay.

32:11.033 --> 32:12.933
Our satellite covers only 60%
of the distribution centers.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.601
If our target's not in that
grouping, we're out of luck.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.200
Can we redirect
any other satellite?
I'm trying.

32:19.267 --> 32:21.701
BUCHANAN:
Jack, the medic's
on the way.

32:21.768 --> 32:23.634
JACK:
Did you identify
the distribution center

32:23.701 --> 32:24.933
that they're gonna hit?

32:25.000 --> 32:25.967
We're pulling in
more satellites.

32:26.033 --> 32:27.734
Our analysts tell us

32:27.801 --> 32:30.467
once the Sentox hits
the main tank, it goes
right into the pipes,

32:30.534 --> 32:31.868
where it becomes impossible
to stop.

32:31.933 --> 32:33.367
From there, it goes straight
into people's homes.

32:33.434 --> 32:34.734
How many casualties
are we talking about?

32:34.801 --> 32:36.701
The largest centers serve
90,000 people.

32:36.768 --> 32:38.300
We could have twice
that many casualties.

32:38.367 --> 32:40.167
If our intel is correct,
we have 15 minutes.

32:40.234 --> 32:42.200
Okay, I'll prep a team
with Curtis. We'll go airborne.

32:42.267 --> 32:46.234
We'll be ready as soon
as you ID a target.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.334
Mr. Buchanan?

32:48.401 --> 32:49.734
There may be a faster way.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.567
I was a chem major
at Cal Tech.

32:51.634 --> 32:52.701
Most toxins become inert

32:52.768 --> 32:54.534
under high pressure.

32:54.601 --> 32:55.868
The PSI would have
to be lowered

32:55.933 --> 32:57.167
before the nerve gas
was introduced.

32:57.234 --> 32:58.601
Chloe, can you monitor
the pressure levels

32:58.667 --> 32:59.768
at the distribution centers?

32:59.834 --> 33:00.768
Yeah. I have citywide

33:00.834 --> 33:01.834
readings of them all.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.300
Hold on.

33:12.933 --> 33:14.834
Wilshire Gas Company.

33:14.900 --> 33:17.534
The PSI has dropped to 75%
in the past ten minutes.

33:17.601 --> 33:19.434
We have to assume that's it.
I'll tell Jack.

33:19.501 --> 33:20.567
Great work, Sherry.

33:20.634 --> 33:22.534
Congratulations.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.067
Thanks.

33:24.134 --> 33:27.367
Did you see the way his hand
brushed across my shoulder

33:27.434 --> 33:28.900
as he walked by?

33:30.000 --> 33:31.367
What?

33:31.434 --> 33:33.967
That was wrong.

33:34.033 --> 33:36.100
He shouldn't have done that.

33:57.868 --> 34:00.100
( rustling )

34:00.167 --> 34:01.067
What is it?

34:01.134 --> 34:02.033
Get down!

34:12.199 --> 34:13.434
Get in the car!

35:05.068 --> 35:06.634
JACK:
Chloe, what's the PSI level?

35:06.701 --> 35:08.734
PSI level is down to 57%.

35:08.801 --> 35:11.300
Another seven is all they need
to deploy the Sentox.

35:11.367 --> 35:12.901
How long will that take?

35:12.967 --> 35:14.333
Four, maybe five minutes.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.767
Jack, the PSI level
can only be adjusted

35:16.834 --> 35:18.500
from the main control room.

35:18.567 --> 35:20.801
It's the large building
in the center of the complex

35:20.867 --> 35:21.934
two floors down from the roof.

35:22.001 --> 35:23.001
Copy that.

35:23.068 --> 35:25.300
Okay, we'll insert here.

35:25.367 --> 35:26.500
We'll advance
to the control room,

35:26.567 --> 35:28.101
locate and secure the canisters.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.867
We're almost there.

35:29.934 --> 35:33.068
The noise from the plant
should cover our descent.

35:53.701 --> 35:55.034
We're ready.

35:55.101 --> 35:56.134
Good.

35:56.200 --> 35:57.567
Get back here.

36:03.168 --> 36:05.233
How much longer?

36:05.300 --> 36:09.967
A few more minutes.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.534
I can't lower the pressure
any faster

36:11.600 --> 36:12.967
without risking a shutdown.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.001
Chloe, it's Jack.

36:20.068 --> 36:21.400
Do you have any
heat signatures?

36:21.467 --> 36:25.168
Yes, but I can only scan
from the exterior of the site.

36:25.233 --> 36:26.934
There are two guards
patrolling the perimeter.

36:27.001 --> 36:29.001
I've given the pilot
an approach vector

36:29.068 --> 36:31.934
to keep you from
their line of sight.

36:54.967 --> 36:57.500
Maintain this position!

37:00.367 --> 37:01.934
Go!

37:13.634 --> 37:14.867
CTU,

37:14.934 --> 37:16.467
the team's away.

37:16.534 --> 37:17.734
They're on the roof.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.300
The PSI level is down

37:20.367 --> 37:22.867
to 54%.

37:40.734 --> 37:43.267
CTU, we're inside.

37:43.333 --> 37:45.267
Jack, Bierko will be ready
to deploy any minute.

37:45.333 --> 37:47.333
Copy that.

38:17.267 --> 38:18.367
( silenced gunshots )

38:40.534 --> 38:41.667
Silencers off.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.267
Door.

39:08.434 --> 39:09.434
Bierko!

39:22.834 --> 39:24.134
( gunshots continue )

39:37.001 --> 39:37.600
( beep )

39:46.667 --> 39:49.101
Keep moving! Cover me!

40:02.134 --> 40:03.701
Curtis, the Sentox is already
in the system.

40:03.767 --> 40:06.267
Who's in charge here?!

40:06.333 --> 40:07.801
Listen to me.

40:07.867 --> 40:09.200
You have Sentox nerve gas
running through your pipeline.

40:09.267 --> 40:10.467
Can you shut down
the pumps?

40:10.534 --> 40:12.034
By the time we power down,
gas will be

40:12.101 --> 40:13.634
in the main tanks,
then it's out into the city.

40:13.701 --> 40:14.734
Where's the closest pipeline

40:14.801 --> 40:16.600
that feeds those tanks?

40:16.667 --> 40:17.934
Just out the door
to your left.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.701
It'll have a red arrow
on it.

40:19.767 --> 40:21.034
Give me the C4 and a timer,
then get these people
out of here.

40:21.101 --> 40:22.600
BUCHANAN:
Jack, what are you doing?

40:22.667 --> 40:26.300
In order to deliver the Sentox,
it had to mix with natural gas.

40:26.367 --> 40:30.101
If we could ignite that gas
before it leaves the plant,

40:30.168 --> 40:31.767
the Sentox will
be incinerated.

40:31.834 --> 40:35.400
Bill, this is the last chance
we've got to stop this threat.

41:01.867 --> 41:03.867
The Sentox has been in
the system for one minute.

41:03.934 --> 41:04.867
You have 50 seconds

41:04.934 --> 41:06.233
before it gets out.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.134
Charge has been set.

41:26.068 --> 41:27.867
Curtis, are you clear?

41:27.934 --> 41:29.967
Just about.

41:30.034 --> 41:32.001
Keep going.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.200
BUCHANAN:
Jack, are you clear?

41:36.267 --> 41:37.734
Jack?

41:38.767 --> 41:40.500
Jack, respond.

41:47.701 --> 41:49.434
Come on, Jack.

41:50.534 --> 41:53.634
( loud explosions )

42:09.068 --> 42:10.701
Jack, you okay?

42:14.567 --> 42:16.200
Curtis, I got a visual
on Bierko.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.267
Jack, you won't have time

42:17.333 --> 42:18.567
before the main
tank explodes.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.333
Right now he's our only
connection to Henderson.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.068
Jack!

42:22.667 --> 42:24.567
Bill, he's going in.

42:30.134 --> 42:32.701
JACK:
Bierko!

42:32.767 --> 42:34.901
( rumbling explosion )

42:34.967 --> 42:36.434
( loud thud )

42:46.168 --> 42:47.367
Jack, that's it.
The main tanks are going.

42:47.434 --> 42:48.934
Get out!

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
