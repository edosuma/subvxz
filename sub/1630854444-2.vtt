WEBVTT

01:10.375 --> 01:11.208
Nina.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.458
No.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.166
Nina!

01:27.250 --> 01:28.208
Nina.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
No!

01:32.041 --> 01:33.208
No!

02:25.750 --> 02:28.458
We received this
from the company a couple minutes ago.

02:38.041 --> 02:41.166
We tried to establish contact. No reply.

02:44.541 --> 02:45.500
Captain.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.000
There's more.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.208
I've never seen anything like it.

03:06.333 --> 03:10.041
I have no idea why, but every compass
on board is doing the same thing.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.500
What happened on the Prometheus?

03:18.708 --> 03:20.791
Why is that boy the only one you found?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.416
You, Olek!

07:02.958 --> 07:03.958
Captain.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.333
Find out how much coal
we have in the bunkers.

07:09.916 --> 07:12.166
Don't tell anyone
what I just asked you to do.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.458
Don't be afraid of
what happened on that ship.

08:50.041 --> 08:52.125
Our Lord will protect us.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.000
Let us all pray.

08:55.875 --> 09:00.250
Be with us, Lord, in a world
where the powers of darkness are strong.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.791
Don't let the waves of darkness
close around us.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.791
Have mercy on us

09:05.875 --> 09:08.666
when we lack endurance and fortitude.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.500
Strengthen us

09:10.583 --> 09:13.958
when we are trapped by worry and fear.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.250
O Holy Spirit,

09:16.916 --> 09:18.833
may we be protected from evil

09:19.375 --> 09:21.333
and all the falseness of the world.

09:21.833 --> 09:23.708
Let your spirit light up before us

09:24.208 --> 09:26.875
and testify with our spirit
that we are yours.

09:27.375 --> 09:29.875
Then even darkness
will become light for us.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.166
When you are together with us,

09:32.875 --> 09:34.875
nothing shall harm us,

09:35.791 --> 09:36.875
our Lord.

11:54.375 --> 11:57.208
It's odd they only found
one single boy on the ship.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.500
He must be really lonely.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.458
I feel sad for him.

12:06.541 --> 12:07.708
Don't you?

12:11.458 --> 12:14.083
What is he going to do
once we get to America?

12:14.708 --> 12:16.416
Is he going to live on his own?

12:17.541 --> 12:18.666
Go to school there?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.708
I've given this a lot of thought.

12:22.791 --> 12:26.791
When we get to America, I will convince
Mother and Father to let me finish school.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.791
They'll never let you.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.000
We'll have to help build the church.

12:37.291 --> 12:40.666
Way I see it, God gives us a calling.
Like He did with Mother and Father.

12:52.750 --> 12:57.000
I think God wants me to become a doctor,
and I need to finish school for that.

12:59.583 --> 13:01.375
Do you know what your calling is?

13:05.208 --> 13:06.750
Go get on Tove's nerves.

13:07.583 --> 13:10.250
Or play with your doll
or do whatever else you usually do.

13:10.333 --> 13:12.291
When did you stop being any fun?

13:42.833 --> 13:45.125
You're a difficult man to find.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.833
I want you to keep it.

14:26.666 --> 14:27.791
For you.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.583
Krester?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.583
Krester?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.958
So that's your name.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.416
I'll see you around, Krester.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.666
Who was that? Huh? Who was that?

14:58.750 --> 15:00.625
-What did he want?
-I don't know.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.291
I don't know.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.750
Remember, you promised me something.

15:29.916 --> 15:32.375
When the ships were sold
a couple of months ago,

15:32.458 --> 15:34.708
did anything about that
strike you as strange?

15:35.458 --> 15:36.458
I…

15:38.416 --> 15:41.166
I was just relieved
that they kept half of the crew.

15:42.833 --> 15:43.833
That's not a given.

15:43.916 --> 15:47.041
Selling the ships to an English company
and keeping half the German--

15:47.125 --> 15:50.500
We're carrying barely any freight.
Just like the Prometheus.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.625
Our cabins aren't fully occupied either.

15:54.708 --> 15:57.708
The company travels this route
without making any profit.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.333
45,000 tons of steel, fully seaworthy.

16:01.416 --> 16:03.000
And only two words.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.125
Captain.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.583
Everyone is waiting for your orders.

16:25.666 --> 16:29.833
The crew, the passengers,
they're all asking questions.

16:29.916 --> 16:33.541
They want to know what's wrong
with the boy and why we're not moving.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.708
What am I supposed to tell them?

16:47.625 --> 16:49.250
Spooky, isn't it?

16:55.916 --> 16:57.916
What do you think happened over there?

17:09.625 --> 17:11.125
I've seen photographs of Japan.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.833
It looks fascinating.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.541
Astonishing flowers and trees.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.625
The shape of houses.

17:20.666 --> 17:22.791
Living behind rice paper walls.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.458
I wish I would have the chance
to see Japan one day.

17:44.416 --> 17:45.625
Ling Yi.

17:45.708 --> 17:47.083
What are you doing?

17:48.125 --> 17:49.291
Come.

17:59.791 --> 18:01.958
She's an exotic little bird.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.541
You speak French?

18:04.625 --> 18:05.666
A little.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.333
Do you mind?

18:26.833 --> 18:30.583
I couldn't help but notice
that your honeymoon doesn't seem

18:31.333 --> 18:32.500
ideal.

18:32.583 --> 18:34.291
I don't see how that's your business.

18:40.041 --> 18:41.500
Why do you look at me like that?

18:41.583 --> 18:44.083
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man you are.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.041
Oh, really?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.958
What does that mean?

18:47.041 --> 18:49.458
I was just wondering
if you're the kind of man

18:49.541 --> 18:51.750
who might be interested
in a certain sort of…

18:53.083 --> 18:54.083
distraction.

19:04.666 --> 19:07.583
Even if I was desperate,
I'd never be that desperate.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.291
Don't be ridiculous.

19:10.458 --> 19:12.166
I'm not talking about myself.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.750
I'm talking about that exotic little bird.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.916
Why would they want us to sink the ship?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.458
And how would we even do that?

21:41.791 --> 21:42.833
We do nothing.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.041
We wait.

21:49.583 --> 21:51.083
And the captain?

21:54.000 --> 21:55.875
They should have replaced him back then.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.000
You don't recover
from something like that.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.875
Your own wife setting herself

22:03.958 --> 22:05.916
and the three children on fire.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.833
It haunts you forever.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.375
Nina?

23:25.375 --> 23:26.333
Nina?

23:46.958 --> 23:47.791
Nina?

24:13.375 --> 24:15.625
And should I be locked

24:15.708 --> 24:19.208
Into the darkest dungeon

24:19.291 --> 24:24.916
'Tis all futile work

24:25.000 --> 24:30.583
For my thoughts tear all gates

24:30.666 --> 24:33.500
And walls asunder

24:33.583 --> 24:36.083
Thoughts are free

24:37.416 --> 24:38.458
You're late.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.291
The girls have been waiting for you.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.791
Off you go. Get ready for bed.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.083
I'll warm up your dinner.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.000
Nina.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.625
The dreams are back.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.375
But don't worry.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.583
I'm sure she will be better soon.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.416
You're not real.

25:30.583 --> 25:32.625
Why would you say something like that?

25:39.125 --> 25:40.833
You should speak to Mama.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.208
She doesn't like it when you're gone.

25:45.916 --> 25:47.750
That's when the shadows come out.

25:49.416 --> 25:53.250
I told her you can't shackle
someone who loves the sea to land.

25:53.958 --> 25:55.708
You have to let them go.

25:55.791 --> 25:59.875
And if you're lucky, he'll wash back
into your arms with the next tide.

26:14.416 --> 26:16.375
I miss you all so much.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.583
No! No!

26:54.375 --> 26:55.375
Nina.

31:43.875 --> 31:45.541
Spooky, isn't it?

31:55.916 --> 31:57.666
I didn't mean to startle you.

31:59.458 --> 32:00.708
Are you part of the crew?

32:02.500 --> 32:03.833
You don't look like crew.

32:08.833 --> 32:11.125
People say we shouldn't
judge anyone by their looks.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.958
It's impossible though, isn't it?

32:20.250 --> 32:23.541
I'm sure you made your mind up
about me as soon as you saw me.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.666
It must be hard working on a ship.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.000
It's a bit like a prison, isn't it?

32:43.583 --> 32:47.875
Even the birds up there
have their own prison.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.291
They can't escape who they are.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.291
And neither can we.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.458
Do I know you from somewhere?

33:11.875 --> 33:13.500
My name is Clémence.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.583
Jérôme.

33:23.541 --> 33:24.708
I have to go.

33:26.166 --> 33:27.291
You're right.

33:29.416 --> 33:31.416
I did make up my mind about you

33:32.000 --> 33:33.833
the moment I saw you.

33:53.958 --> 33:55.250
There he is.

33:56.458 --> 33:58.375
Hey, you!

34:00.208 --> 34:01.166
Stop!

34:01.916 --> 34:02.916
Stop him!

34:19.000 --> 34:22.916
I knew you were a liar from the get-go.
Someone stole a crew uniform yesterday.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.791
You wouldn't happen to know
who that someone is?

34:41.083 --> 34:43.333
Do you know what we do with stowaways?

35:22.333 --> 35:25.708
Krester, Mother is still looking for Ada.
No one has seen her for hours.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.041
She wants us to help find her.

35:34.333 --> 35:35.583
Where did you get that?

35:36.208 --> 35:37.083
Give it to me.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.916
Was it that man who gave it to you?

35:44.708 --> 35:45.875
You fool.

35:47.708 --> 35:49.041
Why did you accept it?

35:53.833 --> 35:55.041
Because.

35:56.458 --> 35:59.291
Because it was nice of him
to give it to me.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.291
And what did he want?

36:04.083 --> 36:06.083
Rich people don't give you
anything for free.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.708
They always want something in return.

36:11.708 --> 36:13.583
You of all people should know that.

36:48.791 --> 36:50.583
You look like you got some rest.

36:51.833 --> 36:53.708
I guess it wasn't a dream after all.

36:57.291 --> 36:58.500
Why are we still here?

36:58.583 --> 37:01.625
-Do you think they'll send someone?
-Send who?

37:04.083 --> 37:04.958
The police.

37:07.875 --> 37:10.791
There are hundreds of people
missing from that boat.

37:11.375 --> 37:13.500
The last thing
they're interested in is us.

37:17.791 --> 37:18.791
That boy.

37:18.875 --> 37:20.750
The look in his eyes.

37:21.541 --> 37:22.916
It was terrifying.

37:24.625 --> 37:25.875
Let go of me.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.708
Hey!

37:30.833 --> 37:33.250
You rich fuckers think
everything belongs to you.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.750
That you can take whatever you want.
Keep your dirty hands off my brother.

37:36.833 --> 37:39.375
If you touch him again,
I'll fucking cut your dick off.

37:53.750 --> 37:54.583
What?

37:56.916 --> 37:58.375
Don't look at me like that.

37:59.708 --> 38:00.875
Don't judge me.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.833
Don't you dare judge me.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.333
I've never pretended
to be someone I'm not.

39:15.583 --> 39:16.750
I…

39:17.625 --> 39:19.708
I found out what you wanted to know.

39:27.708 --> 39:28.541
And?

39:29.250 --> 39:30.666
The bunkers are half-loaded.

39:30.750 --> 39:32.333
Two of them are almost empty.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.416
So roughly 3,000 tons remaining.

39:38.083 --> 39:42.125
Captain, when will we get back on course?

39:46.458 --> 39:47.416
Captain.

39:54.041 --> 39:54.916
Fuck.

42:05.750 --> 42:07.833
Why do you always have to spoil the mood?

42:07.916 --> 42:09.458
That's what concerns you?

42:10.083 --> 42:11.500
That I'm spoiling the mood?

42:14.375 --> 42:17.291
-What are you so afraid of?
-I'm afraid they will find out.

42:17.375 --> 42:18.708
Find out what?

42:20.541 --> 42:23.375
That you're not really a priest
or not really my brother?

42:25.833 --> 42:28.208
Everyone probably
already knows the latter.

42:30.166 --> 42:33.291
Do you really think anyone out there
believes we're brothers?

42:35.375 --> 42:36.375
Look at yourself.

42:37.166 --> 42:38.125
You are pathetic.

42:39.458 --> 42:41.458
For Christ's sake,
you're not even Spanish.

42:43.291 --> 42:44.333
You're not my brother.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.333
You're not a priest.

42:47.583 --> 42:48.750
You're Ramiro.

42:49.708 --> 42:51.708
A goddamn Portuguese servant.

42:51.791 --> 42:52.916
But it doesn't matter.

42:53.875 --> 42:56.666
People are so occupied
with their own bullshit

42:56.750 --> 42:58.666
that they don't give a damn.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.541
Everything's a game to you.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.208
For God's sake, Ramiro.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.750
It is, isn't it?

43:10.250 --> 43:11.166
All of it.

43:13.041 --> 43:14.583
Your mother was right.

43:15.208 --> 43:16.708
You use people.

43:16.791 --> 43:19.916
You don't care.
Not about me, not about anyone!

43:37.416 --> 43:38.708
You're just jealous.

43:41.291 --> 43:42.500
That's all.

47:26.750 --> 47:29.833
This is ridiculous!
We can't turn around. Out of the question!

47:30.541 --> 47:32.833
What's the point in saving an empty ship?

47:32.916 --> 47:34.208
It doesn't make any sense.

51:12.916 --> 51:15.541
He's acting against
a clear order from the company.

51:15.625 --> 51:18.041
And we will all bear the consequences.

51:19.666 --> 51:21.750
Why does he want
to tow the Prometheus back?

51:22.958 --> 51:24.541
Perhaps we should just do it.

51:25.041 --> 51:26.041
Do what?

51:29.166 --> 51:30.541
Sink the ship.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.000
Perhaps.

52:15.458 --> 52:16.291
Captain.

52:17.541 --> 52:19.333
I think you'd better come with me.
