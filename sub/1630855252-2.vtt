18:27.200 --> 18:29.050
Aww.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.380
Oh, my gosh, Melanie!

18:31.580 --> 18:33.720
What are you doing here?

18:33.920 --> 18:35.510
Annie! I literally
told you yesterday

18:35.710 --> 18:37.550
- how I work out here
every Saturday morning.
- That's right.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.100
I must've forgotten.
Oh, Melanie,

18:40.300 --> 18:41.520
this is my friend Santiago.

18:41.720 --> 18:42.830
Santiago, this is Melanie.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.230
She also hates marriage.

18:46.430 --> 18:48.360
Hi.
[laughs]

18:48.560 --> 18:49.960
Hi.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.070
When I asked Henry's parents
to share their traditions,

18:56.270 --> 18:58.160
I thought they were talking
about Filipino traditions,

18:58.360 --> 18:59.580
'cause ours kind of intersect,
you know,

18:59.780 --> 19:01.580
- no thank you,
Spanish colonizers.
- Yeah.

19:01.780 --> 19:03.710
But no, they're
proud Texans, okay?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.580
Texas wedding traditions
are almost as bad

19:05.780 --> 19:07.830
as their track record
on reproductive rights, okay?

19:08.030 --> 19:09.840
Exhibit A, Henry texts me today,
he goes,

19:10.040 --> 19:13.550
"Which one of these cowboy hats
looks best with my suit?"

19:13.750 --> 19:16.680
No hats, Henry!
No hats is best, okay?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.010
Okay, you have to chill out
because it's very hard

19:19.210 --> 19:21.010
to do a lymphatic drainage
to your face

19:21.210 --> 19:22.220
when your eye is twitching.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.430
Okay, there.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.900
This really helps
with puffiness.

19:27.090 --> 19:28.400
And I have a new serum

19:28.600 --> 19:30.190
that I mix with tinted
moisturizer

19:30.390 --> 19:32.400
to make you look
dewy and fresh.

19:32.600 --> 19:33.900
- Mm.
- Like, "Oh,

19:34.100 --> 19:35.450
I just woke up like this."

19:35.650 --> 19:37.780
[laughter]

19:37.980 --> 19:40.700
Wow, I forgot how good
you are at this.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.580
Like... really good.

19:42.780 --> 19:46.210
Thanks. This is why I
wanted to be a makeup artist.

19:46.410 --> 19:47.960
All this creative stuff that
you've been letting me

19:48.160 --> 19:50.170
practice on you since I could
hold a blush brush.

19:50.370 --> 19:53.050
Well, I am the perfect canvas.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.260
It just sucks, because at Lash,

19:55.460 --> 19:56.970
it's mostly about
selling products.

19:57.170 --> 19:59.590
And this is what I love.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.930
I think I want to focus more on
building my own client list,

20:03.130 --> 20:04.310
and do more private events.

20:04.510 --> 20:06.390
I can do that, right?

20:06.590 --> 20:08.310
Of course you can do that, Lil.

20:08.510 --> 20:10.730
I mean, you were just so
dick-drunk on Santiago

20:10.930 --> 20:13.780
that you, like, neglected the
things you actually care about.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.740
Which, I'm sorry to say, like,
you have a tendency to do.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.660
Like, you lose yourself
in a relationship.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.620
One cute boy comes along
and it's like "bye!"

20:20.820 --> 20:22.990
to all the, like, cool stuff
you're working on.

20:23.190 --> 20:25.080
Well, I'm not getting
that raise,

20:25.280 --> 20:27.500
- so all the more reason to
do my own thing.
- Yes.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.210
Otherwise, I'm just going to
live in this house

20:29.410 --> 20:30.500
until I inherit it.

20:30.700 --> 20:31.750
Oh, that's cute
that you think that

20:31.950 --> 20:33.040
you're inheriting the house.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.670
I'm the favorite child.

20:34.870 --> 20:37.760
- Lil! Lily!
- [laughs]

20:37.960 --> 20:39.300
It's a setting spray,
don't worry. Look at...

20:39.500 --> 20:41.680
God, at my engagement party?

20:41.880 --> 20:43.050
Well, look at how
beautiful you look.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.260
Yeah, you're right,
it looks amazing.

20:44.460 --> 20:45.640
Yeah, do a little bit more
on the brow.

20:45.840 --> 20:48.100
I'm sorry we blindsided you
on your hike.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.440
No, I appreciate the company.

20:50.640 --> 20:54.190
But, uh, you and I have
actually met before.

20:54.390 --> 20:55.530
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.730 --> 20:56.690
Uh, you remember that.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.360
I was kind of hoping you didn't.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.450
A couple of years ago
we went on a date.

21:00.650 --> 21:01.820
Oh, a very short date.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.620
Apparently he had to go home
because he was excited

21:04.820 --> 21:06.620
to finish the book
he was reading.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.910
Which was actually a gift,
because I was

21:09.110 --> 21:10.580
looking for an excuse
to start therapy.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.960
Well, that-that wasn't a lie.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.420
Yeah, I've known this guy
for a long time.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.170
He's really that much of a nerd.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.420
I remember the name of the book.
<i>The Overstory.</i>

21:19.620 --> 21:22.720
By Richard Powers?
I love that book.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.900
All right, I would've
left my ass, too.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.890
Well, I'm sorry for how I acted.

21:28.090 --> 21:30.690
- I was pretty
closed off back then.
- And now?

21:30.890 --> 21:34.400
Now? Now, I'm smart enough
to put down a good book

21:34.600 --> 21:37.380
if it means getting to know
a beautiful woman better.

21:38.710 --> 21:40.900
Good answer.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.920
- That's my boy.
- Great answer! Great answer.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.830
- [Sol] It's kind of a nice day.
- [Marta] It is a lovely day.

21:49.030 --> 21:51.410
[gasps]
Is this it?

21:51.610 --> 21:53.960
Oh, yes.

21:54.160 --> 21:57.690
Your <i>abuelo</i> brought me here
on our first date in Portland.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.090
<i>Que</i> cute.

22:02.290 --> 22:05.140
Well, we didn't have a
lot of money when we got here

22:05.340 --> 22:08.140
but that didn't stop
your <i>abuelo.</i>

22:08.340 --> 22:09.770
- Thank you.
- [gasps]

22:09.970 --> 22:13.440
<i>Abuelo</i> was so smooth.
Look, another clue.

22:13.640 --> 22:14.580
Ooh.

22:19.330 --> 22:21.150
"One breathes fire,

22:21.350 --> 22:25.740
and we kissed under
one of these many times

22:25.940 --> 22:27.240
when we were courting."

22:27.440 --> 22:31.080
I guess <i>abuelo</i> got tired
of rhyming. [laughs]

22:31.280 --> 22:32.500
"Breathes fire"?

22:32.700 --> 22:34.040
Dragon.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.790
Yes! Dragon bridge?

22:36.990 --> 22:40.300
Dragon canopy?
Dragon church pew?

22:40.500 --> 22:42.130
How many things did y'all
kiss under?

22:42.330 --> 22:45.720
A lot. We were hiding
from my parents.

22:45.920 --> 22:48.050
- [snaps fingers]
- Dragontree.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.970
Dragontree Spa.

22:50.170 --> 22:51.980
I love that place.

22:52.170 --> 22:53.140
Me, too.

22:53.340 --> 22:54.850
- Okay, first we eat...
- Mm-hmm.

22:55.050 --> 22:55.900
...and then we get pampered.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.320
Let's drink. Wow.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.610
Thank you for showing me
your ways, <i>Rey</i> of Romance.

23:02.810 --> 23:03.610
[laughs]

23:03.810 --> 23:05.660
Eh, cause <i>"rey"</i> means king?

23:05.860 --> 23:07.070
Yeah, I got it.

23:07.270 --> 23:10.200
Marta wanted time with Sol,
but I also know

23:10.400 --> 23:11.750
she needed a little spoiling.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.460
It's brilliant.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.620
You don't stop playing
when you get old.

23:15.820 --> 23:18.000

Book signing.
That's hot.

You think a book signing is hot?

I was just being supportive.

There was totally a vibe.

24:20.510 --> 24:22.020
Yeah, no, Melanie was cool.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.730
But, Annie,
you got to chill out.

24:23.930 --> 24:26.150
Okay, listen, I know
you're an introvert

24:26.350 --> 24:28.280
who doesn't like
all that sappy love stuff,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.320

you and Lily ended things,

24:37.320 --> 24:38.710
I'm a little insistent,

24:38.910 --> 24:40.670
I can push you out
of your comfort zone.

24:40.870 --> 24:43.000
So, yes, because I love you,
I'm going to do what I do.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.150

Don't get your hopes up.

25:35.380 --> 25:37.020
Yeah, we are so happy for Henry.

25:37.210 --> 25:38.680
He was, like, such a dork
in high school,

25:38.880 --> 25:40.270
that we actually thought
he'd never find someone.

25:40.470 --> 25:41.600
- [laughter]
- Oh, I don't believe that!

25:41.800 --> 25:43.520
No, you are right.
Everybody loved him.

25:43.720 --> 25:44.810
And he's always been handsome.

25:45.010 --> 25:47.280
But, no, there was a rough patch
where he had a mullet.

25:47.470 --> 25:49.110
- And I bet he pulled it off.
- [Javier] You know what?

25:49.310 --> 25:50.900
- He kind of did.
- [laughter]

25:51.100 --> 25:52.320
Well, Henry's picking up
his parents.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.740
- He'll be here really soon.
- Oh, great.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.330
- We're going to hit up the bar.
- All right. Have fun.

Look at this place.
Looks like your Pinterest page

26:00.200 --> 26:01.500
- come to life.
- Yeah.

26:01.700 --> 26:03.880

Nope, she won't.

Oh, is she sick?

She's very lovely. I...
- Yeah.

to feel weird about this.

26:33.060 --> 26:34.780

- Lea, give Jorge his hat.
- Oh, oh, yes!

27:02.220 --> 27:03.020
- No.
- For sure.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.980
- Here you go.
- Okay.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.730
- [Lea] Oh. Perfect. Perfect.
- Oh... wow.
- Perfect!

27:07.930 --> 27:09.150
Everybody say "Yee-haw."

27:09.350 --> 27:12.400
[all] Yee-haw!

27:12.600 --> 27:15.200
Mm. I am so happy for them.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.620
Ever since Henry met Jorge,

27:17.820 --> 27:19.700
he basically floats
into work every day.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.700
He's like a butterfly
you want to punch in the face.

27:22.900 --> 27:26.210
- They're disgustingly cute.
- Mm. And Jorge looks amazing,

27:26.410 --> 27:30.170
as usual. I would kill
for his skin and eyebrows.

27:30.370 --> 27:33.210
Oh. Oh, that-that's not him,
that's me. I'm a makeup artist.

27:33.410 --> 27:35.130
- I did his makeup.
- He's wearing makeup?

27:35.330 --> 27:38.550
- Yup. A lot of it.
- Oh, dang, girl. You are good.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.260
Thank you! I appreciate it.

27:40.460 --> 27:42.140
You know, if you
or any of your friends ever want

27:42.340 --> 27:44.060
to get your makeup done,
hit me up.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.020
- I can do natural or full glam.
- Hmm.

27:46.220 --> 27:47.560
And I am now taking
private clients.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.650
Okay, well, I actually
have a wedding next weekend.

27:50.850 --> 27:52.480
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's going to be
crawling with ex-boyfriends.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.030
I want my presence
to make them weep with regret.

27:55.230 --> 27:58.030
- That is my specialty. Mm-hmm.
- Yes, girl!

27:58.230 --> 28:00.090
I'll get your info
from Henry. Ciao!

28:01.970 --> 28:04.200
- I am in hell.
- What? Why?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.160
This party is incredible.

28:06.360 --> 28:08.120
Yeah, of course
the party's incredible,

28:08.320 --> 28:10.380
but Henry's parents are now
choreographing a line dance?

28:10.580 --> 28:12.340
One and two
and three, clap-clap.

28:12.540 --> 28:16.220
It's like what's next?
Like, a barn-raisin' weddin'?

28:16.420 --> 28:18.340
I was so worried
about them not liking me,

28:18.540 --> 28:20.720
that it never occurred to me
that I might not like them.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.350
And, Lil, this is forever.
This is for life!

28:23.550 --> 28:25.430
Yes, that's what marriage is.

28:25.630 --> 28:27.560
[panting] Do something.
I'm feeling very overwhelmed

28:27.760 --> 28:29.150
about the largeness
of all of this, and I...

28:29.340 --> 28:31.110
Okay, Jorgito, everything
is going to be okay.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.980
This is a very
natural reaction, okay?

28:34.180 --> 28:36.440
Yeah. You're right.
Everything's going to be fine.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.990
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

28:38.190 --> 28:42.620
Oh, oh, speaking of fine,
oh, Dinesh is here. Yummy.

28:42.820 --> 28:45.240
- Ah. Yum-yum.
- Right. There she is.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.000
Lil gonna Lil.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.500
What does that mean?

28:48.700 --> 28:50.040
It means that a few hours ago,

28:50.240 --> 28:51.580
we had a very
meaningful conversation

28:51.780 --> 28:53.290
about your next steps,
and I don't want

28:53.490 --> 28:55.420
to see some cute boy
derail that.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.760
- True.
- Good.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.340
But he's so hot!

29:00.540 --> 29:02.100
All right. Throw it all away.

29:02.290 --> 29:03.510
Someone should have fun tonight.

29:03.710 --> 29:05.100
Jorgito, stop being so dramatic.

29:05.300 --> 29:07.230
You're about to marry
the love of your life, okay?

29:07.420 --> 29:09.640
I'm the one who's alone
and living with our parents.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.560
- And you're much older.
- Mm-hmm.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.650
- Mm.
- [laughs] That made me feel

29:13.850 --> 29:14.980
a lot better, thank you.

29:15.180 --> 29:16.980
Of course.

29:17.180 --> 29:19.610
Oh, God. Oh, no. Henry's mom's
talking to the DJ.

29:19.810 --> 29:21.670
- I have to go.
- Oh.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.430
[phone vibrating]

29:36.270 --> 29:38.050
- Hey.
<i>- [Melanie] Hi.</i>

29:38.250 --> 29:40.050
<i>I was going to wait</i>
<i>for you to text me,</i>

29:40.250 --> 29:42.470
<i>but I don't</i>
<i>have time for that.</i>

29:42.670 --> 29:44.430
[laughs]

29:44.630 --> 29:47.890
- Hi.
- Hey. [laughs]

29:48.090 --> 29:50.600
It's so funny to see you here,
'cause just yesterday,

29:50.800 --> 29:52.600
- I sat on your face.
- Oh! [laughs]

29:52.800 --> 29:54.020
Right, my bus advertisements.

29:54.220 --> 29:56.070
[both laugh]

29:56.270 --> 29:57.360
The life of a realtor.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.360
Mm-hmm. You should
shave that beard, though.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.780
It's a little prickly.

30:00.980 --> 30:03.530
- Some people like it.
- Huh.

30:03.730 --> 30:07.030
♪ <i>I love you...</i>

30:07.230 --> 30:09.250
Hey, congrats on the gym, man.
That's great.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.040
Thank you, thank you. [laughs]

30:11.240 --> 30:13.210
Where is Ana?
I really like her.

30:13.410 --> 30:15.840
- [sighs]
- [Miles] Oh. Uh-oh.

30:16.030 --> 30:17.750
- Did we miss some <i>chisme?</i>
- [Sol chuckles]

30:17.950 --> 30:19.760
Hmm? Yeah,
I'm not going to stop.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.550
<i>Lo siento, no lo siento.</i>

30:21.750 --> 30:24.260
I didn't invite her, okay?
And now I'm getting

30:24.460 --> 30:26.720
Diaz'd about it, and as much
as I'd like to think

30:26.920 --> 30:28.640
that everyone else is wrong,
I know

30:28.840 --> 30:30.680
that if the Diaz family thinks
you screwed up, you screwed up.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.390
Yeah, Nick, you screwed up.

30:32.590 --> 30:34.480
I mean, why didn't you
just invite her?

30:34.680 --> 30:37.940
I don't know!
I just... God! It...

30:38.140 --> 30:39.280
[sighs]

30:39.470 --> 30:42.200
You know what? No. It is fine.

30:42.390 --> 30:43.700
She is very, very laid back.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.170
In fact, I am going
to text her right now.

30:47.630 --> 30:51.430
"Hey, babe."
Heart emoji, heart emoji.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.770
Hmm?

30:57.350 --> 30:59.840
"Hi." Period.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.170
No emoji. There's no emoji.

31:02.370 --> 31:03.550
I...

31:03.750 --> 31:06.300
Shit.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.050
I'm going to get a drink.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.200
- Oh, you got a...
- Uh, you got a drink
right there. Okay.

31:11.240 --> 31:14.100
Another drink. Another drink.
[clears throat]

31:14.300 --> 31:17.610
[laughs]
Oh. I remember those days.

31:17.800 --> 31:19.400
Feeling clueless.

31:19.600 --> 31:21.110
Well, that will never
be you again

31:21.310 --> 31:22.940
after your day with my <i>abuelo.</i>

31:23.140 --> 31:25.610
Listen, uh,

31:25.810 --> 31:27.700
I need to talk to you
about something.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.740
I was going to wait,
but I've learned

31:29.940 --> 31:32.250
that keeping things
from you isn't wise.

31:32.440 --> 31:33.700
Okay.

31:33.900 --> 31:36.180
It's about Luis.

31:38.930 --> 31:41.090
Okay, this is great. Come back
and get the empanadas next

31:41.290 --> 31:43.590
once that's gone, okay? Thanks!

31:43.790 --> 31:45.880
Honey, my parents have some news

31:46.080 --> 31:47.970
- they're excited
to share with you.
- Oh.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.890
As you know, we are
University of Texas alums.

31:51.090 --> 31:52.310
- Hook 'em horns!
- Yeah.

31:52.510 --> 31:54.810
- I remember.
- The school mascot is Bevo,

31:55.010 --> 31:56.270
a beautiful
Texas longhorn steer.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.850
It's a sacred tradition
to have Bevo at your wedding.

31:59.050 --> 32:01.020
- It brings good luck!
- Oh.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.610
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

32:04.810 --> 32:06.780
Yes! It's almost impossible
to book him,

32:06.980 --> 32:09.240
- but I pulled some strings.
- Yes!

32:09.440 --> 32:12.290
May Bevo bring you as many
blessings as he brought us.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.370
- Mm.
- Speaking of blessings,
part of your budget will have

32:14.570 --> 32:16.080
to be allocated
to cleaning up after him,

32:16.280 --> 32:19.210
because, believe me, it's more
than you could possibly imagine.

32:19.410 --> 32:21.790
But worth it!
Hook 'em horns!

32:21.990 --> 32:24.210
- Hook 'em horns!
- Say it with us, Jorge.

32:24.410 --> 32:25.880
[all] Hook 'em horns!

32:26.080 --> 32:28.400
[whispers] Hook 'em horns.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.390
- [laughter]
- It's too much.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.430
- I can't!
- Yeah.

32:33.630 --> 32:36.560
- It's physically hurting him.
- Oh, it definitely is.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.190
Uh, that's the face
he makes when I wear salmon.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.770
Uh... what is going on?

32:41.970 --> 32:43.270
We're just messing with you.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.570
We're proud Texans,
but we're not that tacky.

32:45.770 --> 32:46.900
[Ben] We're just jokesters.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.070
Who would have a bull
at their wedding?

32:48.270 --> 32:50.990
Welcome to the family, Jorgito.

32:51.190 --> 32:52.700
- Oh, thanks!
- [laughter]

32:52.900 --> 32:54.970
- Yes. Bye.
- We'll see you guys.

32:56.890 --> 32:58.750
What just happened?

32:58.950 --> 33:01.920
That is how
my parents express affection.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.250
- Oh.
- Yeah, they only mess
with people they love.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.420
If anyone in my family
is ever too sweet to you,

33:07.620 --> 33:09.090
that's when you should worry.

33:09.290 --> 33:11.300
Really? They love me?

33:11.500 --> 33:13.390
Oh. So no more Texas stuff?

33:13.590 --> 33:15.390
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God!

33:15.590 --> 33:18.810
This is such a relief.
This is the perfect night!

33:19.010 --> 33:21.350
Oh, wait, wait, wait! It's time
for me to ask my groomsmen.

33:21.550 --> 33:23.480
I'm so excited
to show you this magic trick

33:23.680 --> 33:25.320
- I've been working on.
- Okay, ha, ha, Henry.

33:25.520 --> 33:27.280
The joke's over. No more pranks.
[chuckles]

33:27.480 --> 33:30.200
No, I'm serious.
It's going to be awesome!

33:30.400 --> 33:32.990
No, a... a magic trick?

33:33.190 --> 33:34.780
In front of all of these people?

33:34.980 --> 33:35.950
At my engagement party?

33:36.150 --> 33:39.500
Uh, our engagement party.

33:39.700 --> 33:41.870
Henry, you cannot do it.

33:42.070 --> 33:43.380
It's cornier than the hats.

33:43.580 --> 33:47.840
You know I love magic,
and I'm sorry you don't like it,

33:48.040 --> 33:50.630
but I have a right to bring
some of my ideas to the table.

33:50.830 --> 33:51.680
Not if they're embarrassing.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.140
Oh, so... I'm embarrassing?

33:54.340 --> 33:55.850
That's not what I meant.

33:56.050 --> 33:58.160
- I...
- You know
that's not what I meant.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.140
Fuck.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.230
- [laughing] I mean...
- I get it.

34:04.430 --> 34:06.480
Gladys Delgado.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.650
<i>Enchantée.</i> Kiss it.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.110
Oh.

34:11.310 --> 34:14.370
That's right.
I'm Lily's very young aunt,

34:14.560 --> 34:15.830
so if things
don't work out with her,

34:16.020 --> 34:17.120
I could arrange to be single.

34:17.320 --> 34:19.540
Dinesh Mondal.
And I know who you are.

34:19.740 --> 34:22.250
Jorge talked about you often.

34:22.450 --> 34:23.870
Oh, did he?

34:24.070 --> 34:25.460
Did he mention
I'm double-jointed?

34:25.660 --> 34:26.630
<i>- Tía.</i>
- I am.

34:26.830 --> 34:28.000
It didn't come up.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.460
It didn't? That's so weird.

34:29.660 --> 34:30.880
- Well, the legs--
they, flippy-floppy.
- Ah.

34:31.080 --> 34:32.840
All over the place,
whatever you want.

34:33.040 --> 34:35.510
Anyway, be a lamb and get Lily
and I some fresh cocktails

34:35.710 --> 34:37.260
so that we can talk about you.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.600
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.060
[Lily laughs softly]

34:41.260 --> 34:43.600
Ooh! That man,

34:43.800 --> 34:45.150
that suit-- this floor
just became a Slip 'N Slide.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.150
<i>Ay, tía, que suerte.</i>
<i>Esperate, no te caigas!</i>

34:47.350 --> 34:48.570
<i>Oye, oye, pere...</i>
<i>'perate, esperate.</i>

34:48.770 --> 34:50.030
[both laughing]

34:50.230 --> 34:51.360
Please tell me
you're going to get in on that.

34:51.560 --> 34:53.490
[sighs] Oh, we'll see.
I mean, he's super cute,

34:53.690 --> 34:55.110
and the cherry on top
of my good-night sundae.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.200
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm also trying
to hustle right now.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.950
I am doubling down
on private clients,

34:59.150 --> 35:01.160
so tell all your friends
I'm available.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.120
I need the money
to get my life back on track.

35:03.320 --> 35:04.830
Who says you're not on track?

35:05.030 --> 35:06.880
<i>Tía,</i> I'm almost 30
and living with my parents.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.840
What part of my life
is on track?

35:09.040 --> 35:11.260
Oh, baby, no, no, no. I'm going
to tell you a little secret.

35:11.450 --> 35:14.260
The track does not exist.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.180
Oh, it does exist!

35:16.380 --> 35:18.470
No, I need to grow my business,
move out of my parents' house,

35:18.670 --> 35:20.470
fall in love, get married,
buy a house, have kids,

35:20.670 --> 35:22.060
become Beyoncé's
personal makeup artist

35:22.260 --> 35:23.480
and live happily ever after.

35:23.680 --> 35:25.480
That is a fake schedule

35:25.680 --> 35:27.190
that society has been
hammering into your head

35:27.390 --> 35:28.690
since the minute you were born.

35:28.890 --> 35:29.940
Who says you have
to do it in that order?

35:30.140 --> 35:31.530
You don't need a husband
to buy a house.

35:31.730 --> 35:34.110
Hello?! You don't need to wait

35:34.310 --> 35:38.030
