WEBVTT

02:21.040 --> 02:26.000
You want this place
to wash away your sins,

02:27.200 --> 02:28.840
but it ain't gonna happen.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.280
Nobody is erasing the
blood that is on your hands.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.240
You can't run from it, Father.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.640
I have protected you always, Seymour.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.320
And just yesterday I saved
your ass and you never

02:42.320 --> 02:44.160
gave me a second of grace.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.960
We're on the verge of victory, son.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.720
We're gonna honour your brother's
sacrifice and your mother's heart.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.960
- Your brother's sacrifice.
- No.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.040
You took my brother to die
and came back with a girl

03:03.040 --> 03:05.080
who is sleeping in my mother's bed.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.760
Now listen!

03:06.760 --> 03:09.680
If you don't believe, then
what are we doing here?

03:10.640 --> 03:14.520
You know we're gonna find
the gates to this town.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.480
Now get outta here.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.760
You still love me.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.800
I've always loved you
more than anything.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.680
I had no choice, we needed the money.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.840
Maybe that's what you told yourself.

05:14.920 --> 05:16.320
But that's a lie.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.960
What do you mean?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.120
Come on, talk to me.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.040
I saw it in Mama's eyes...

05:29.360 --> 05:30.960
..and Uncle Elijah's.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.080
It doesn't matter if
you forgive me or not.

05:41.080 --> 05:43.360
I'll keep on loving
you, like I always do.

05:45.240 --> 05:47.520
Then why didn't you
come back after the war?

05:50.120 --> 05:53.120
Why didn't you at least
answer my letters, huh?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.600
- That okay?
- That is good.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.800
Now, eat.

07:50.920 --> 07:53.240
- Stuffed
turkey. - Mm-hmm.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.800
What are we celebrating?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.920
That I'm still alive, thanks to you.

07:56.920 --> 08:00.000
That you shot a man,
who was about to kill me,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.120
even though you said you couldn't shoot.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.160
You see? You can do anything
you set your mind to.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.480
- Mama?
- Mm-hmm.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.280
There's something I've
been working on, a secret.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.520
Hmm.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.240
'Swing low, Sweet chariot coming for

09:22.240 --> 09:24.600
'To carry me home...

09:27.240 --> 09:31.920
'I looked over Jordan,
And what did I see,

09:31.920 --> 09:36.240
'Coming for to carry me home?

09:36.240 --> 09:39.960
'A band of angels

09:39.960 --> 09:45.840
'Coming after me, Coming
for to carry me home.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.320
'Swing low, sweet chariot

09:53.480 --> 09:56.880
'Coming for to carry me home...'

10:45.080 --> 10:49.320
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

10:51.520 --> 10:52.960
What do you mean?

10:52.960 --> 10:56.360
I loved you and I protected you and
I taught you everything you know.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.360
And this is how you repay me?

10:58.360 --> 11:03.920
- Mama, I'm sorry, I didn't
kn- - No. You never know.

11:05.640 --> 11:09.080
You never know where
the devil is hiding.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.200
It is my responsibility to protect you.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.200
- Mama.
- Even from yourself.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.480
Please, no, mother, no. I'm begging you.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.160
No, mother, no.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.720
Please! Stop it. I'll
do whatever you want!

11:31.720 --> 11:32.840
Please, stop it.

11:32.840 --> 11:34.800
I'll play whatever you
want. Please, don't!

11:34.800 --> 11:36.920
Help me, do something!

11:36.920 --> 11:38.920
Stop it, do something.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.280
I'll do whatever you want.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.960
I'll play whatever you want.
Please, don't! Help me, do something!

13:03.880 --> 13:05.400
Want one?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.120
Sure.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.480
Let's say you manage
to sell all the oil.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.120
What will you do with all that money?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.760
Clothes,

13:24.480 --> 13:28.400
medicine, farm tools,

13:28.400 --> 13:30.680
people will be able
to light their homes,

13:30.680 --> 13:32.680
we can grow our own food to eat.

13:32.680 --> 13:37.600
This city means more to me and Sarah
than anything in the whole world.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.440
It bonds Sarah and me.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.680
You've already lost a
load down the river and...

13:44.680 --> 13:47.600
..something tells me
it wasn't an accident.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.120
And you think my son, Seymour,
had something to do with it?

13:55.120 --> 13:56.440
Getting there.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.120
The trap was perfectly organised
and only he knew the meeting point.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.520
Maybe the rescue was a show,

14:07.520 --> 14:09.520
protecting her traitor's cover.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.400
Elizabeth could have shot him in
the head the second we said no.

14:21.400 --> 14:24.680
She could've hunted us down
and ground us into a pulp,

14:24.680 --> 14:26.000
but she didn't.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.760
You know why?

14:29.760 --> 14:30.920
Sure.

14:39.320 --> 14:43.840
If Seymour cheated, you only
have one way to find out.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.720
So, what do you have in mind?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.200
Where you been?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.400
Just rode into the highlands.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.800
Got a job for you.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.920
We movin' on again.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.720
First thing in the morning.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.480
You want me to try moving the oil again?

15:43.880 --> 15:45.920
After what happened with the boat?

15:57.960 --> 16:00.080
You in this family, or ain't you?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.920
Here's my plan.

16:14.920 --> 16:20.040
Tomorrow morning, we'll send barrels
of water down south as a diversion.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.720
The real ones go north.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.760
Seymour will lead the southern
expedition, while you and I

16:52.760 --> 16:56.160
take care of the real oil
and sell it to the north.

17:07.760 --> 17:11.160
We'll be very careful not to
be seen loading our barrels.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.000
As you imagine, a lot of
people will know about it.

17:21.760 --> 17:23.360
Seymour's not one of 'em.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.160
That's about far enough.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.320
If you're gonna stop us, you're
gonna have to go through me.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.880
What makes you think I care
about your miserable life, huh?

17:56.600 --> 17:57.800
Move.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.840
Out! Hey!

18:10.320 --> 18:11.760
Fuck.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.200
Once you sell the oil to the
north, you can satisfy your people.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.360
And if something happens
to Seymour's cargo,

18:37.360 --> 18:39.800
at least you will know
who the traitor is.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.600
Whoo! Yeah!

19:05.640 --> 19:09.720
Go see. Go on, go and see what it is.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.840
I'm sorry, ma'am.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.520
Why?

19:58.520 --> 20:00.480
I'm not afraid of war.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.520
And suddenly, the world was perfect.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.960
For tonight, at least.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.120
Seymour.

20:47.440 --> 20:51.720
When I was a boy, I'd look for
any reason to get away from you.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.800
Go and fetch some water, run an errand,

20:58.960 --> 21:01.360
anything to put some
distance between us.

21:04.080 --> 21:06.040
I've always been the odd one out.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.840
Everybody else is the perfect family.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.200
And naively,

21:15.720 --> 21:18.200
you believed it so
much you made it true.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.160
You threw my life away.

21:28.280 --> 21:33.520
Kevin... Phillip... even the stranger...

21:34.800 --> 21:40.640
You sent them with the secret
cargo and left me for dead.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.360
A pawn.

21:45.360 --> 21:46.680
A sacrifice.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.760
Risking my life for a
few gallons of water!

21:51.760 --> 21:53.240
You ain't risked nothing.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.800
- You're here, ain't you?
- I was trying to help.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.440
I don't even believe in this damn
plan and I was trying to help you.

21:59.440 --> 22:00.560
Help?!

22:01.440 --> 22:04.120
You ain't never helped
nobody but yourself.

22:05.360 --> 22:06.680
And I put up with it.

22:07.840 --> 22:12.800
I put up with your mistrust,
I put up with your betrayals.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.240
- The way you treat your sister.
- She ain't my sister.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.120
And she ain't your daughter...

22:18.120 --> 22:19.240
..and she ain't your wife.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.080
She chose me.

22:21.080 --> 22:25.160
You gotta be free... you
gotta be free to choose.

22:25.160 --> 22:28.200
She ain't never been free. Ever!

22:30.320 --> 22:31.560
Huh?

22:38.720 --> 22:43.200
You can stay, or you
can go, I don't care.

22:45.160 --> 22:48.320
But if you stay, no
more special treatment.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.360
No more grace. You understand?

22:56.120 --> 22:57.800
Your projects dead already.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.680
You killed and buried it.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.560
Now all I want is to see you fall.

23:31.640 --> 23:34.880
- Pardon?
- The girl. The girl...

23:34.880 --> 23:36.200
Cheers.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.640
Seymour.

23:55.440 --> 23:56.720
What's wrong?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.000
Hey, where are you going?

24:14.560 --> 24:16.080
Give me a minute.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.160
Seymour. Seymour!

24:22.160 --> 24:23.280
Sarah.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.920
Let him go.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.240
There's nothing you could
do to change his mind.

24:29.240 --> 24:30.920
It's probably better like that, though.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.280
You really think he betrayed us?

24:32.280 --> 24:35.560
All I know is we only sold the
cargo he didn't know anything about.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.440
- That was your idea?
- Yeah.

24:37.440 --> 24:38.960
You're here to destroy my family.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.440
I am your family.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.640
- And you destroyed that one too.
- Sarah...

24:42.640 --> 24:45.120
Destroying families is all
you know how to do, huh?

24:47.360 --> 24:50.120
Seymour ain't perfect
but he is no traitor.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.360
You just turned him into one.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.840
He's only a boy, you
could've had him killed.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.680
Search that house.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.760
You used to hide here when
you needed time to yourself.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.480
You still do.

26:59.520 --> 27:02.560
You should really find a
new place to run away to.

27:02.560 --> 27:04.080
Or you could just come home.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.480
So your husband can hang
me from the palisades?

27:08.480 --> 27:11.480
No one will hang you, if you
find out who the traitor is.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.320
Prove it's not you, make
the rest of us safer.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.240
I don't care about my father anymore.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.640
Why'd you choose him?

27:38.520 --> 27:39.640
Why?

27:43.720 --> 27:48.040
He needed me... and I needed him.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.360
You think I didn't need you?

27:52.320 --> 27:53.720
You're hurting me.

27:53.720 --> 27:56.520
You're the only reason I stayed
as long as I did, you understand?

27:56.520 --> 27:59.160
The only reason. Ah!

28:01.040 --> 28:04.240
You are my brother, but you
will never touch me again.

28:05.280 --> 28:06.680
I'm here to help you.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.280
We need to find the traitor,
so you can come home.

28:12.280 --> 28:13.520
All right?

28:49.080 --> 28:53.040
My name's Sheriff
Boone, of Bexar County,

28:53.040 --> 28:56.040
and I suggest that you let us in.

28:56.040 --> 28:57.240
So, come on now.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.040
You John Ellis?

29:20.040 --> 29:21.400
I'm him.

29:22.960 --> 29:26.160
Now, this here's a
warrant for your arrest.

29:27.920 --> 29:29.120
What's the charge?

29:29.120 --> 29:32.920
Fraud, trespassing, and grand larceny.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.720
See, this land belongs to
Madam Elizabeth Thurmann.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.160
We're not here illegally.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.800
This land was given to him by
his former owner, Henry Allen,

29:40.800 --> 29:42.000
through legitimate deed.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.720
Well, your trial's in
Elmdale in a week's time.

29:45.720 --> 29:49.240
You can present your "legitimate
deed" to the judge then.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.400
But for now, you're coming with me.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.560
No, sir.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.960
It's a summons.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.920
All it says is when
I have to be in court.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.800
Next week in Elmdale, then.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.600
You're facing serious
charges, Mr. Ellis.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.520
Folks have swung for less.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.800
Okay, we're done.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.600
John, the deed's gone...

30:38.480 --> 30:40.360
You still gonna defend Seymour?

30:47.840 --> 30:49.280
I was a step ahead.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.400
Had it on me day and night
since the attack on the barge.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.000
And I had an exact
copy made, just in case.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.680
- The trial's still in Elmdale.
- Sarah.

30:59.680 --> 31:00.840
That's her town.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.200
- Sarah, come on...
- She'll have her thumb on the scale

31:03.200 --> 31:05.920
and you're still a Black
man in Bexar County.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.120
Yeah.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.840
But my lawyer ain't.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.320
You do what I asked?

31:40.040 --> 31:41.200
Good boy.

31:43.120 --> 31:47.360
I suggest you stay...
right where you are.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.480
Give me back what that boy stole.

31:50.480 --> 31:54.800
Seymour. Have you finally
come to your senses?

31:54.800 --> 31:57.840
Sleeping in the woods helps me reflect.

31:57.840 --> 32:00.280
I know what your father did to you.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.920
I hope you decided which side to be on.

32:05.680 --> 32:08.440
You know, it's not too
late for you to join us.

32:19.800 --> 32:22.680
I don't think you're
dumb enough to shoot me.

32:24.240 --> 32:28.120
Just in case, I took precautions.

32:32.240 --> 32:33.480
Mm.

32:39.880 --> 32:44.520
This is the second time I
could have had you killed.

32:46.280 --> 32:47.960
That's not what I want.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.840
Go to your daddy.

32:53.320 --> 32:58.480
Tell him the boy he welcomed
inside of his gates is a traitor.

32:58.480 --> 33:03.480
Because of his weakness, I now have
the deed he extorted from my father.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.320
Now...

33:09.000 --> 33:10.160
..go.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.040
I'm Martin Gress.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.080
Seems my old comrade, John
Ellis, needs my help removing

33:37.080 --> 33:38.960
his chestnuts from a fire.

33:48.320 --> 33:49.560
Colonel.

33:50.360 --> 33:53.800
Captain John Ellis, you have
quite a welcoming committee.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.080
It's been a long time.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.440
- Is it counsellor now?
- Counsellor's just fine.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.000
All right, then.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.920
You remember Kevin and Phillip? C'mon.

34:04.920 --> 34:06.600
Don't remember 'em that big.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.280
- C'mon now.
- Hey.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.560
This is my wife, Sarah.

34:10.560 --> 34:11.680
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.640
And this here's Django.

34:13.640 --> 34:14.840
Sir.

34:16.480 --> 34:17.680
What unit were you in?

34:20.520 --> 34:22.040
I spent the war in France.

34:23.240 --> 34:25.760
- He's one of
us now. - Uh-huh.

34:26.720 --> 34:29.040
- C'mon, let's head inside.
- All right.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.080
- She was a fine woman.
- Yes, she was.

34:37.080 --> 34:39.440
Her spirit is very much
a part of this town.

34:40.960 --> 34:43.200
And that's why I'll
defend it to the end.

34:46.360 --> 34:47.680
You remember that?

34:47.680 --> 34:49.680
It was right before Chambersburg.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.720
How could I forget?

34:52.480 --> 34:54.400
He was a good soldier, your son.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.320
Andrew's a part of us too.

35:07.200 --> 35:11.800
I'm supposed to go to Elmdale,
to face a county judge.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.960
They're saying I stole this land.

35:13.960 --> 35:15.720
Who'd they say you stole it from?

35:15.720 --> 35:17.480
Elizabeth Allen Thurmann.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.760
So you're saying she's lying?

35:18.760 --> 35:22.320
Yes, sir. It's my inheritance.
I got the deed to prove it.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.080
Elizabeth's father gave
me this on his deathbed.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.680
Here's the way you win this.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.800
You take your beautiful family

35:39.800 --> 35:42.680
and you run as far away
from here as you can.

35:45.800 --> 35:47.480
You don't think it's real?

35:47.480 --> 35:48.560
Oh, I do. But...

35:48.560 --> 35:51.480
I don't think a piece of
paper is gonna stop that woman.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.600
Not in Bexar County. Look, I
know Judge Fourier a little.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.880
If we can get him to accept
this deed as legitimate evidence,

35:58.880 --> 36:00.400
then maybe we have a shot.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.200
Hold on, one second. You say Fourier?

36:03.200 --> 36:06.280
You telling me the
judge is a rebel colonel?

36:06.280 --> 36:08.280
You won't find a judge
around here who wasn't.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.400
These are Texas courts.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.960
They didn't legally consider
you a person until they had to.

36:14.960 --> 36:18.400
I bet Fourier still
doesn't. The deed is...

36:19.720 --> 36:22.400
- ..it's better than nothing, but...
- This can't be happening.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.160
I'll talk to him,

36:29.240 --> 36:33.520
before he gets to Elmdale,
see where things stand.

36:33.520 --> 36:37.640
If there is any way you can
win this, I will fight like hell

36:37.640 --> 36:39.720
so you can keep what's yours.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.520
But, if there's not, then at
least you'll have fair warning.

36:43.400 --> 36:47.560
- Either way, I'm not running.
- I'm not asking you to, yet.

36:47.560 --> 36:52.040
But the choice might come
down to running or dying.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.920
My son, Seymour, betrayed me,
and uh, he might do it again.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.720
I have to be very careful.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.920
You remember that, uh,

37:04.920 --> 37:07.120
that emporium that
Barney's widow used to run?

37:07.120 --> 37:08.600
Mm-hmm.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.120
- Near Ratchet
Creek? - Mm-hmm.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.480
Well, meet me there the
day before the trial.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.560
And bring me good news, my friend.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.200
I'll see which way the wind blows.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.960
Well, all right.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.120
We need the colonel.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.520
Colonel Fourier.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.920
The Bluecoats up on Taylor Hill
are signalling for reinforcements.

37:41.920 --> 37:45.600
I think if we can press on 'em
now, we can catch them unawares

37:45.600 --> 37:47.960
and make sure they don't get in.

37:47.960 --> 37:50.440
If they get those cannons on
that hill, they'll drive us back

37:50.440 --> 37:51.680
to where we started, sir.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.720
Well, we are not gonna let that happen.

38:00.560 --> 38:03.080
Come in. It's open.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.840
I was just about to eat.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.880
Sit down.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.320
I'm not hungry.

38:23.320 --> 38:25.800
It's nothing fancy, it's, uh...

38:25.800 --> 38:28.080
It's the soup I used to make. Remember?

38:32.840 --> 38:35.960
I heard you weren't
claiming your rations.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.160
We've got plenty now that
we're selling the oil.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.880
I love this recipe.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.080
If you're not gonna
eat, why are you here?

39:03.120 --> 39:04.760
John's going to go to Elmdale.

39:07.800 --> 39:11.120
I need you to go with him,
make sure he's alright.

39:12.400 --> 39:16.200
Whether I go or not, it's a
suicide mission either way.

39:16.200 --> 39:19.600
So was the war. You still
managed to come back.

39:31.800 --> 39:36.880
All right. I'll do it, on one condition.

39:43.680 --> 39:45.240
You serious?

39:45.240 --> 39:46.640
Don't waste it.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.400
You really don't remember?

40:28.360 --> 40:29.880
You used to love it.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.920
So... So, you're going with him?

40:35.920 --> 40:37.680
Now you have my word.

40:46.000 --> 40:50.000
I used to write to your
brigade, every week,

40:50.000 --> 40:51.840
and never heard back.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.800
So, one night I rode to White Creek
and I gave a soldier two dollars

40:54.800 --> 40:56.920
to tell me where the
letters got delivered.

40:56.920 --> 40:59.240
And I came back every week...

40:59.240 --> 41:02.800
..to give him another two
dollars to tell me where you were.

41:02.800 --> 41:06.880
I spent every night embroidering
handkerchiefs to pay for that.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
For two years.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.400
Tracking where you were,
hoping you might answer.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.600
Until Chambersburg.
That's where I lost you.

41:20.040 --> 41:24.040
I don't give up, and, for
once, you can't either.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.800
John means more to me than my life.

41:30.600 --> 41:32.280
Just bring him home.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.040
All right?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.160
Yeah.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.560
From your family?

42:15.560 --> 42:19.040
Yes, sir. From my daughter.

42:19.040 --> 42:23.320
She also sent me a picture to
show me how much she has grown.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.160
I miss my Ruth and my
boys something fierce.

42:26.160 --> 42:27.920
Their letters keep me going.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.640
This was in the last one.

42:33.640 --> 42:35.480
A gift from my wife.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.360
Let's hope it keeps you lucky.

42:39.360 --> 42:40.760
God willing.

42:42.320 --> 42:45.160
Fourier ordered a predawn attack.

42:45.160 --> 42:47.680
You should answer your daughter.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.680
I've been trying to
write her back for...

42:50.680 --> 42:54.640
..more than 100 times. Can't seem to...

42:56.600 --> 42:58.320
I run.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.360
That's what I do, I run away.

43:00.360 --> 43:03.240
I've never seen a man run toward a war.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.920
I seen plenty go the other way.

43:24.680 --> 43:28.360
Have you ever considered walking out
of those gates and never look back?

43:36.520 --> 43:38.040
Not for a second.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.320
I guess I'll need a horse then.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.280
I don't think it's wise you
showing your face in Elmdale again.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.000
Some folks are saying you robbed a bank.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.400
Folks say a lot of things, don't they?

43:57.200 --> 43:59.720
I don't want your
death on my conscience.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.080
I was about to say the same thing.

44:03.120 --> 44:05.200
You know this is suicide, right?

44:06.560 --> 44:11.200
It's not the first time that
death is the best option for me.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.880
Ah!

45:38.720 --> 45:41.920
Captain! Captain.

45:43.040 --> 45:45.320
Stay with me, okay? Stay with me!

45:45.320 --> 45:47.600
- Captain, get up!
- I have to get home.

45:47.600 --> 45:49.760
I have to get home.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.560
Get up! Stay with me! Captain!

46:11.040 --> 46:15.600
A PERSON LEGITIMIZES HIMSELF BY
HIS ACTS, NOT BY HIS FAITH ALONE.
