"Childhood is not
from birth to a certain age.

00:27.695 --> 00:31.906
"And at a certain age, the child is grown
and puts away childish things.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.625
"Childhood is the kingdom
where nobody dies."

00:50.843 --> 00:52.510
Jake! Jacob!

01:23.125 --> 01:24.167
Phil!

01:29.214 --> 01:30.715
It's happening.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.229
You just have to break them in.

01:45.731 --> 01:49.108
I've been breaking them in. For three days.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.193
Can l just go barefoot?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.612
No, absolutely not.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.906
Just thinking it's a little much, you know?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.200
The dress and the shoes,

01:57.493 --> 01:58.493
and all of this.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.413
No, it's exactly enough.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.707
Tomorrow will be perfect.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.834
Where do you want them, boss?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.294
On either side of the aisle.

02:09.463 --> 02:12.048
-What aisle?
-Does no one have vision?

02:29.983 --> 02:32.527
You, go home and get lots of beauty sleep.

02:32.820 --> 02:33.861
That's an order.

02:35.239 --> 02:36.364
Okay.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.122
l was just checking for cold feet.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.460
Well, mine are toasty warm.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.212
It's not too late to change your mind.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.922
What? Now you're having second thoughts?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.135
You are.

03:41.638 --> 03:44.098
No, I've been waiting a century
to marry you, Miss Swan.

03:45.309 --> 03:49.061
But?

03:51.064 --> 03:53.232
l haven't told you everything about myself.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.567
What? You're not a virgin?

04:04.328 --> 04:06.787
Look, you can't scare me away now.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.501
Look, a few years after Carlisle created me,

04:13.712 --> 04:15.630
l rebelled against him.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.257
l resented him for curbing my appetite.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.719
And so for a while, l went off on my own.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.430
l wanted to know how it felt to hunt.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.396
To taste human blood.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.232
All the men I killed

05:18.527 --> 05:20.069
were monsters.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.033
And so was I.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.581
Edward, they were all murderers.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.670
You probably saved more lives
than you took.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.172
Bella, that's what l told myself.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.967
But they were all human beings.

05:43.927 --> 05:48.014
l looked into their eyes as they died
and l saw who l was,

05:48.098 --> 05:49.849
and what l was capable of.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.937
And what I'll be capable of.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.440
Why are you telling me this tonight?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.443
Did you really think
this was gonna change my mind about you?

06:00.569 --> 06:04.030
l just wondered
if it would change your mind about yourself,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.657
and who you wanna see when
you look in the mirror a year from now.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.371
l know l can do this.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.707
Let me tell you why.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.375
Because you did.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.795
You should give yourself
some credit for that.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.757
Now, hopefully, a year from now,

06:22.841 --> 06:26.302
I'm gonna look in the mirror
and see someone like you.

06:27.304 --> 06:33.142
l mean, someone capable of courage
and sacrifice and love.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.107
--What is that?

06:40.192 --> 06:42.151
- Come on! Let's go!
- I'm late for my bachelor party.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.155
Send him out, Bella,
or we're coming in after him.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.450
So, this party.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.369
Will there be strippers?

06:54.206 --> 06:57.708
No, just a couple of mountain lions.
Maybe a few bears.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.629
Don't worry, Bella,
we'll give him back in plenty of time.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.132
Okay, go, before they break my house.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.967
Let's go! Let's go!

07:15.018 --> 07:16.852
I'll meet you at the altar.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.689
I'll be the one in white.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.275
That was very convincing.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.970
What did l say about beauty sleep?

09:15.305 --> 09:17.348
Sorry, bad dream.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.101
lt was wedding jitters.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.647
Do you need some help?

09:25.315 --> 09:27.066
l could do her hair.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.235
Really?

09:33.073 --> 09:36.242
Please.
I'm not offended by your choice of groom.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.995
Just my blatant lack of respect for mortality.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.623
Essentially.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.710
Weddings. They bring everyone together.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.589
Hey, so, did you find our daughter?

09:50.674 --> 09:52.758
Are those graduation caps?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.011
How creative!

09:57.514 --> 09:58.681
Or weird.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.015
Alice? Bella?

10:00.100 --> 10:01.558
In here, Mom.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.898
Oh, my gosh!

10:07.983 --> 10:09.817
You're so beautiful.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.568
Oh, honey.

10:12.028 --> 10:12.987
Crap! My mascara.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.154
Mom!

10:14.781 --> 10:16.031
Thanks.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.409
Charlie, get in here.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.204
You sure? l don't wanna...

10:28.253 --> 10:29.962
l know. l look hot.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.632
We thought you needed something blue.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.093
And something old.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.387
- Besides your mother.
- Nice.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.267
-lt was Grandma Swan's.
-But we added the sapphires.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.811
It's beautiful, you guys.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.813
Wow. Thank you so much.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.232
It's your first family heirloom.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.988
Pass on to your daughter, and her daughter.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.537
Mom, l love it.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.123
Nope. No smudging my masterpiece.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.207
She's right.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.712
Thank you.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.091
Okay.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.053
Time for the dress!

11:20.764 --> 11:23.515
Do you wanna see it?
l want to see it!

11:37.447 --> 11:38.781
They have got to be related.

11:39.783 --> 11:40.824
What a gene pool.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.701
Seriously.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.371
You've got some... The drool.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.793
So, you think Bella's gonna be showing?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.420
Jess, she is not pregnant.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.173
Okay. Who else gets married at 1 8?

12:19.656 --> 12:20.989
You ready?

12:22.450 --> 12:23.450
Yeah.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.457
Just don't let me fall, Dad.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.334
Never.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here on this glorious day

14:41.464 --> 14:45.509
to witness the union of Edward Cullen
and Bella Swan.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.470
Please repeat after me.

14:48.846 --> 14:52.349
l, Edward Cullen.

14:52.809 --> 14:54.393
Take you, Bella Swan.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.770
-Take you, Bella Swan.
-To have and to hold.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.651
To have and to hold.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.112
For better or for worse.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.656
For richer, for poorer.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.410
In sickness and in health.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.871
To love.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.082
To cherish.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.252
As long as we both shall live.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.674
l do.

15:28.219 --> 15:31.138
l love you.

15:35.018 --> 15:40.105
Have I found you

15:40.189 --> 15:44.735
Flightless bird

15:44.819 --> 15:49.323
Jealous

15:49.407 --> 15:56.288
Weeping or lost you

15:58.625 --> 16:03.211
American mouth

16:03.296 --> 16:10.177
Big pill looming

16:11.888 --> 16:16.475
Now I'm a fat house cat

16:16.559 --> 16:21.313
Nursing my sore blunt tongue

16:21.397 --> 16:25.317
Watching the warm poison rats

16:25.401 --> 16:30.155
Curl through the wide fence cracks

16:36.537 --> 16:38.038
Just thought it'd be bigger.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.122
Yeah.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.332
-Hi!
-Hi, guys.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.335
We were just saying how pretty
everything is, you know, just saying.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.629
Well, thanks so much.
You don't think it's too much?

16:45.713 --> 16:47.130
-No.
-Not at all.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.590
-No.
-No.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.967
Hey, man. Nice to see you.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.804
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.389
l hope you'll be happy, Bella.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.474
Thank you, Billy.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.142
Have you heard from him?

16:59.394 --> 17:01.228
I'm sure Jake wishes you the best.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.398
Well, l plan on getting drunk.

17:06.733 --> 17:08.652
They're serving up
some pretty fancy champagne.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.029
Sue, can l get you a glass?

17:11.114 --> 17:12.823
Sparkling fire water.

17:13.657 --> 17:14.657
Sounds great.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.537
Bella.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.957
-Congratulations, Edward.
-Thank you.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.040
Bella.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.209
Eleazar and Carmen, right?

17:24.292 --> 17:25.419
-Mmm-hmm.
-Hola.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.212
Yes, and these are our cousins from Alaska.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.297
-Tanya, Kate.
-We've heard so much about you.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.841
-Welcome to the family.
-Bienvenida.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.592
Thank you.

17:37.432 --> 17:38.473
Irina.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.726
Come meet Bella.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.899
-l can't do this.
-You promised.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.778
They invited one.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.453
Irina, he's our friend.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.246
They killed Laurent.

18:01.622 --> 18:02.706
He tried to kill Bella.

18:03.666 --> 18:04.833
l don't believe that.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.960
He wanted to be like us.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.546
To live in peace with humans.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.047
With me.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.175
I'm sorry.

18:15.136 --> 18:16.803
- Irina!
- Well.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.224
Let's not monopolize the bride.
Congratulations.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.392
Thank you.

18:22.477 --> 18:23.810
Sorry.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.190
Well, what's a wedding
without some family drama?

18:28.274 --> 18:29.691
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.359
Is this on?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.570
Hello?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.451
Umm, I'd like to propose a toast.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.661
To my new sister.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.291
Bella, I hope you've gotten enough sleep
these last 18 years.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.544
'Cause you won't be getting any more
for a while.

18:54.383 --> 19:00.096
Well, Bella was just like everybody else,
totally mesmerized by Edward.

19:01.015 --> 19:02.974
Or "The Hair," as l call him.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.020
And then, suddenly,

19:07.104 --> 19:09.356
Edward is all about Bella.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.069
Even though she's not the captain
of the volleyball team.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.905
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.323
Or the president of the student council.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.076
Edward will be a good husband.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.622
I know this because I'm a cop.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.416
I know things.

19:29.418 --> 19:33.421
Like how to hunt somebody
to the ends of the Earth.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.217
Now that you're my sister,

19:37.301 --> 19:39.261
you'll have to get over
your aversion to fashion.

19:40.263 --> 19:42.389
And I know how to use a gun.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.475
Skirts, heels, handbags.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.979
Go to sleep, my love

19:49.939 --> 19:52.107
Go to sleep

19:53.943 --> 19:55.902
When you wake

19:56.988 --> 19:59.155
You'll see me

19:59.323 --> 20:01.575
I'd like to thank Renée and Charlie

20:01.784 --> 20:05.954
for bringing such a wonderful person
into the world and into our lives.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.082
We will cherish and protect her forever.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.210
It's an extraordinary thing

20:12.420 --> 20:16.298
to meet someone
who you can bare your soul to.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.884
And who will accept you for what you are.

20:22.263 --> 20:25.974
I've been waiting,
what seems like a very long time,

20:27.685 --> 20:29.644
to get beyond what I am.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.273
And with Bella,

20:35.610 --> 20:37.193
I feel like I can finally begin.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.911
So I'd like to propose a toast
to my beautiful bride.

20:49.081 --> 20:53.168
No measure of time with you
will be long enough.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.005
But let's start with forever.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.853
Whoa!

21:15.399 --> 21:16.691
Whoa!

21:25.868 --> 21:27.702
Another one of your gifts just arrived.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.120
What?

21:30.748 --> 21:31.873
Yeah, come on.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.169
What's a wedding present doing out here?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.964
Just a little more private.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.925
The best man didn't have time to get a tux.

21:42.593 --> 21:43.593
Jacob!

21:45.846 --> 21:47.013
Jacob.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.600
--Hey.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.145
-Hey, Bella.
-Hey.

21:54.897 --> 21:56.022
This is kind of you.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.233
Kind is my middle name.

22:02.989 --> 22:05.240
I'll see if Rosalie wants to dance.

22:06.701 --> 22:08.034
I'm sorry I'm late.

22:08.369 --> 22:09.911
Doesn't matter.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.789
Everything's perfect now.

22:15.251 --> 22:16.584
Will you dance with me?

22:29.223 --> 22:30.515
Where have you been?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.436
We were gonna put your face
on a milk carton.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.605
Mostly northern Canada.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.275
l think.

22:41.569 --> 22:45.363
It's weird to be back on two legs again,
in clothes.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.409
Gotten out of practice
with the whole human thing.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.663
Are you okay?

22:56.250 --> 22:57.625
Being here?

23:00.004 --> 23:02.881
Why? Afraid I'll trash your party?

23:12.308 --> 23:13.850
You're not the only one.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.981
You'd think I'd be used to telling you
goodbye by now.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.864
Come on, you're not supposed to be
the one crying, Bella.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.953
Everyone cries at weddings.

23:36.499 --> 23:39.042
This is how I'm gonna remember you.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.044
Pink cheeks.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.380
Two left feet.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.971
Heartbeat.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.268
'Cause what,
soon I'm gonna be dead to you?

23:57.353 --> 23:58.436
No.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.448
I'm sorry.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.368
I'm just trying to appreciate
your last night as a human.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.372
Well, it's not my last night.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.418
l thought you...

24:24.213 --> 24:27.340
l didn't really wanna spend my honeymoon
writhing in pain.

24:27.716 --> 24:29.384
What's the point?

24:32.096 --> 24:34.222
It's not like you're gonna have
a real honeymoon with him, anyway.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.891
It's gonna be as real as anyone else's.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.643
That's a sick joke.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.521
You are joking?

24:43.607 --> 24:45.066
What? While you're still human?

24:45.359 --> 24:48.403
You can't be serious, Bella.
Tell me you're not that stupid.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.573
l mean, it's really none of your business.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.159
-No! You can't do this!
-Jake.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.119
-Listen to me, Bella.
-Jake, let me go!

24:56.579 --> 24:58.454
Jacob, calm down, all right?

24:58.539 --> 25:00.623
Are you out of your mind? Huh?
You'll kill her!

25:01.458 --> 25:02.458
Walk away, Jake.

25:07.965 --> 25:08.965
Enough, Jacob!

25:10.301 --> 25:11.426
Stay out of this, Sam.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.595
You're not gonna start something
that we'll have to finish.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.013
She'll die.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.598
She's not our concern anymore.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.076
Let's go, Seth!

25:42.458 --> 25:44.125
I'm really, really, really stupid.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.793
No, it's all right.

25:47.463 --> 25:50.965
Come on, people are probably missing us.
Let's go back.

26:10.778 --> 26:13.029
So, he really won't tell you
where he's taking you?

26:13.447 --> 26:14.989
No, it's a surprise.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.495
Well, wear a hat.

26:21.038 --> 26:22.038
Sunscreen.

26:22.665 --> 26:23.706
Take care of yourself.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
l will.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.502
Okay.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.506
l love you, Bella.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.258
l love you.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.009
So much.

26:43.644 --> 26:44.644
Thank you.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.071
Everything's packed and ready to go.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.240
Cool.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.080
Oh.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.291
-I'm gonna go see him.
-Yeah.

27:15.926 --> 27:16.968
Dad.

27:21.515 --> 27:22.598
Well...

27:25.394 --> 27:27.270
It's gonna be strange,

27:28.188 --> 27:30.398
you not living under my roof.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.318
Yeah.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.987
It's gonna be strange for me, too.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.491
You know
it will always be your home, right?

27:49.585 --> 27:51.919
l love you, Dad. Forever.

27:59.428 --> 28:00.762
l love you, too, Bells.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.098
l always have and l always will.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.356
All right.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.526
Go on.

28:15.778 --> 28:18.112
You don't wanna miss your plane.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.448
Wherever it's going.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.786
Okay.

28:27.331 --> 28:28.498
Bye.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.296
You ready?

28:56.193 --> 28:57.193
Yeah, I'm ready.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.553
Please pull over.

30:44.885 --> 30:47.345
So, we're not staying in Rio?

30:47.429 --> 30:49.764
No, we're just passing through.

30:50.724 --> 30:52.225
Are we close?

31:08.784 --> 31:10.409
That's lsle Esme.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.828
lt was a gift from Carlisle.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.846
ls this totally necessary?

31:31.807 --> 31:34.141
l am nothing if not traditional.

31:48.824 --> 31:51.033
You wanna take a look around?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.001
You tired?

32:48.383 --> 32:50.217
Do you wanna go for a swim?

32:50.427 --> 32:52.386
Yeah, that sounds nice.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.730
l could use a few human minutes.

33:09.279 --> 33:10.946
Don't take too long, Mrs. Cullen.

33:13.742 --> 33:14.867
Okay.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.515
Okay.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.934
She's a caged animal

33:40.018 --> 33:42.436
London by night

33:42.521 --> 33:44.689
Crashing lights and cymbals

33:44.773 --> 33:46.857
Queens of twilight

33:46.942 --> 33:49.276
And if I was you I'd use the loo

33:49.361 --> 33:51.654
Before the long drive

33:51.738 --> 33:53.781
We complement each other

33:53.865 --> 33:55.533
Just like Satan and Christ

33:56.868 --> 34:00.871
Baby, when I am laid to rest

34:00.956 --> 34:03.040
May my laughter remain

34:03.125 --> 34:05.918
Like your kiss blew me away

34:06.628 --> 34:08.795
Answer your spirit

34:08.880 --> 34:11.132
I gotta know right now

34:11.216 --> 34:13.217
I see you before me

34:13.301 --> 34:14.844
Won't you show me how?

34:14.928 --> 34:15.928
Alice!

34:16.012 --> 34:17.888
I wear my hair fizzy

34:17.973 --> 34:20.099
I don't copy no style

34:20.183 --> 34:22.893
But kissing and a-scrubbing

34:22.978 --> 34:24.978
It has consequences

34:25.063 --> 34:26.563
You're on the bus again

34:26.648 --> 34:27.940
Past Big Ben

34:28.024 --> 34:30.234
With your rip off Oyster card

34:38.452 --> 34:40.828
Don't be a coward.

35:05.228 --> 35:08.814
Gotas mínimas

35:25.499 --> 35:31.337
Caudales de agua

35:33.548 --> 35:35.299
You're so beautiful.

35:41.556 --> 35:46.060
Agua lisa

35:55.737 --> 35:57.238
l promised that we'd try.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.200
If this doesn't work...

36:02.369 --> 36:03.661
l trust you.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.290
Tu vida...

36:27.352 --> 36:30.980
I've waited a hundred years

36:31.940 --> 36:35.401
But I'd wait a million more

36:35.485 --> 36:37.778
For you

36:45.161 --> 36:50.374
Nothing prepared me
for the privilege of being yours

36:50.458 --> 36:51.834
It's okay.

37:01.803 --> 37:07.558
If I had only felt the warmth
within your touch

37:10.103 --> 37:15.566
If I had only seen
how you smile when you blush

37:18.069 --> 37:23.782
Or how you curl your lip
when you concentrate enough

37:23.867 --> 37:29.830
I would have known what I was living for

37:35.170 --> 37:38.005
What I've been living for

37:45.555 --> 37:49.266
Your love is my turning page

37:49.351 --> 37:54.021
Only the sweetest words remain

38:00.737 --> 38:04.365
Every kiss is a cursive line

38:04.449 --> 38:09.203
Every touch is a redefining phrase

38:16.544 --> 38:22.424
I surrender who I've been for who you are

38:24.052 --> 38:30.140
Nothing makes me stronger
than your fragile heart

38:32.102 --> 38:37.439
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours

38:37.524 --> 38:39.900
I would have known

38:39.985 --> 38:41.110
How badly are you hurt?

38:44.239 --> 38:45.239
What?

38:55.333 --> 38:57.001
No, Bella, look.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.930
Bella, l can't tell you how sorry l am.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.279
I'm not.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.032
Really, I'm not. I'm fine.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.992
Don't say you're fine.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.745
Just don't.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.705
No, you don't.

39:35.582 --> 39:36.707
Don't ruin this.

39:36.833 --> 39:37.916
I've already ruined it.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.214
Why can't you see
how perfectly happy l am?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.801
Or was five seconds ago.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.680
l mean, now I'm sort of pissed off, actually.

39:52.182 --> 39:54.058
You should be angry with me.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.895
l mean,
we knew this was gonna be tricky, right?

39:59.022 --> 40:00.939
l think we did amazing.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.487
l mean, it was amazing for me.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.907
That's what you're worried about?

40:09.991 --> 40:12.117
That l didn't enjoy myself?

40:15.121 --> 40:17.706
l know it's not the same for you,

40:19.793 --> 40:23.587
but for a human, l can't imagine
that it gets any better than that.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.259
Last night

40:30.220 --> 40:32.096
was the best night of my existence.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.644
You're the best.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.580
You're not gonna touch me again, are you?

41:04.045 --> 41:05.546
You know that's not what l mean.

41:06.422 --> 41:08.048
Let me make you breakfast.

41:22.188 --> 41:26.024
Dreamed last night about a time and place

41:28.069 --> 41:31.989
Where from our troubles we had escape

41:34.492 --> 41:38.579
I held your hand and I felt complete

41:41.457 --> 41:45.210
As you turned and said to me

41:47.714 --> 41:49.423
From now on

41:50.717 --> 41:54.261
From now on we'll be

41:54.345 --> 41:55.971
You and me

41:57.599 --> 41:59.600
We will be

42:00.685 --> 42:02.728
From now on

42:04.105 --> 42:07.524
From now on we'll be

42:07.609 --> 42:10.861
You and me
You and me

42:10.945 --> 42:12.946
We will be

42:35.637 --> 42:38.889
Only a dream

42:38.973 --> 42:41.975
From now on

42:42.060 --> 42:45.562
Only a dream

42:45.647 --> 42:47.606
From now on

42:48.983 --> 42:51.985
Only a dream

42:52.070 --> 42:55.239
From now on

42:55.323 --> 42:58.450
Only a dream

42:58.534 --> 43:00.577
From now on

43:00.662 --> 43:03.872
You and me, we will be

43:22.016 --> 43:23.016
l win.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.074
Bella?

43:43.037 --> 43:44.788
You having a nightmare?

43:45.373 --> 43:46.456
No.

43:55.383 --> 43:57.175
lt was just a dream.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.513
lt was a really good dream.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.640
Then why are you crying?

44:05.310 --> 44:07.644
Because l wanted it to be real.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.314
Tell me.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.196
Bella, l can't.

44:21.868 --> 44:26.788
Please.

45:00.573 --> 45:03.116
Maybe they'll say
she was in a car crash.

45:03.951 --> 45:05.702
Or tripped and fell off a cliff.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.455
Keep it in play! Keep it in play!

45:08.790 --> 45:10.082
Come on!

45:11.959 --> 45:13.460
Come on! Come on!

45:14.462 --> 45:16.129
At least I'll get one thing out of it.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.800
No, you won't.

45:21.344 --> 45:24.221
Cullens are not a danger
to the town or the tribe.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.516
Well, he's either gonna kill her
or change her.

45:27.600 --> 45:30.018
-And the treaty says...
-l say, Jacob.

45:31.270 --> 45:32.437
l say.

45:39.237 --> 45:41.822
You know, if you wanted things different,
you should've become alpha.

45:44.826 --> 45:48.245
Turning it down seemed like a good idea
at the time.

45:48.329 --> 45:51.832
Jake, you really think you could kill Bella
if she comes back a vampire?

45:51.916 --> 45:54.543
No, make one of us do it,
then hold a grudge against us.

45:54.669 --> 45:56.086
Shut up, Leah.

45:56.337 --> 45:59.548
Would you just get over it?
It's not like you've imprinted on her.

46:02.427 --> 46:03.802
At least they seem happy.

46:06.347 --> 46:08.098
Yeah, some people are just lucky, l guess.

46:08.224 --> 46:09.224
Lucky?

46:11.394 --> 46:13.812
None of them
belong to themselves anymore.

46:14.147 --> 46:18.275
And the sickest part is
their genes tell them they're happy about it.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.321
Least if you imprinted on someone,
you'd finally forget about Bella.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.245
l mean, being any kind of happy is better
than being miserable

46:30.329 --> 46:31.997
about someone you can't have.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.976
Bella, these are our housekeepers,
Gustavo and Kaure.

46:54.145 --> 46:55.770
This is my wife Bella.

46:56.189 --> 46:57.272
Excuse me.

47:01.068 --> 47:03.778
Well, l guess we just leave them to it.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.035
What was that all about?

47:10.119 --> 47:11.912
She's afraid for you.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.413
Why?

47:15.208 --> 47:17.626
Because l have you here all alone.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.713
You mean she knows about you?

47:21.797 --> 47:23.256
She suspects.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.969
She's native Ticuna. They have legends
about blood-drinking demons

47:28.054 --> 47:31.097
who prey on beautiful women.

47:37.438 --> 47:38.438
Hey.

48:13.266 --> 48:14.641
You're late.

49:12.491 --> 49:13.491
Bella?

49:15.494 --> 49:17.454
Hey, don't come in here.

49:18.998 --> 49:21.124
You don't need to see this.

49:21.959 --> 49:24.461
"In sickness and health," remember?

49:25.504 --> 49:27.088
lt must have been the chicken.

49:27.506 --> 49:28.715
Could you grab my bag?

49:45.232 --> 49:46.232
What is it?

49:50.071 --> 49:53.073
How many days has it been
since the wedding?

49:53.157 --> 49:54.407
Fourteen. Why?

49:57.119 --> 49:58.745
Will you tell me what's going on?

50:00.289 --> 50:01.289
I'm late.

50:02.917 --> 50:04.584
My period, it's late.

50:21.686 --> 50:23.395
That's impossible.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
Can this happen?

50:34.532 --> 50:36.825
- Whoa!

50:46.001 --> 50:47.544
- Alice.
- Bella?

50:48.212 --> 50:49.879
Are you all right?

50:50.297 --> 50:51.589
I'm not 100%¤ sure.

50:51.924 --> 50:54.300
Why? What's wrong? I just...

50:54.427 --> 50:55.927
You just what?

50:56.721 --> 50:57.846
Alice, what did you see?

50:57.930 --> 51:00.682
- Here's Carlisle.
- Bella, what's going on?

51:00.766 --> 51:03.143
l don't know. I'm a little worried.
Can vampires go into shock?

51:03.602 --> 51:04.811
Has Edward been harmed?

51:05.104 --> 51:06.146
No.

51:08.441 --> 51:12.861
l know that it's impossible,
but l think that I'm pregnant.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.072
Whoa!

51:20.119 --> 51:22.996
Carlisle, l swear,
something just moved inside me.

51:26.292 --> 51:28.752
-ls this even possible?
-I don't know.

51:29.336 --> 51:30.295
What's he saying?

51:30.379 --> 51:32.839
The sooner Bella's here,
the sooner we can find out what it is.

51:32.923 --> 51:34.424
I need you to get to the mainland at once.

51:34.508 --> 51:36.259
Yeah, yeah, l will.

51:40.848 --> 51:41.973
Well?

51:53.027 --> 51:54.277
Damn it.

51:55.571 --> 51:57.322
Kaure's making sure you're still alive.

52:06.248 --> 52:11.961
Slow we paddle through the lake

52:12.046 --> 52:16.508
Straight to the very center

52:17.218 --> 52:21.471
Of the darkest water

52:21.555 --> 52:25.225
Where we can embrace

52:25.309 --> 52:29.979
The shadows on the surface

52:30.064 --> 52:34.651
The eyes that look up lifeless

52:34.735 --> 52:38.154
From our twins below

52:40.407 --> 52:45.286
And though your arms and legs are under

52:45.371 --> 52:50.291
Love will be the echo in your ears

52:50.376 --> 52:54.128
When all is lost and plundered

52:54.213 --> 52:58.299
My love will be there still

52:58.384 --> 53:03.763
True, it's chilling to behold

53:04.431 --> 53:08.101
Up close we stumble back...

53:13.357 --> 53:15.275
What did you do with her?

53:16.485 --> 53:18.027
What do you know about this?

53:19.738 --> 53:21.614
l know that you are a demon!

53:22.449 --> 53:23.950
You killed this little girl!

53:25.911 --> 53:26.911
What?

53:27.788 --> 53:29.372
Her people have legends.
She might have seen this before.

53:30.583 --> 53:31.583
Please.

53:32.126 --> 53:33.459
Tell me how to help her.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.420
You only do bad.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.130
l am begging you.

53:37.673 --> 53:39.340
l will do anything.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.217
l love her.

53:43.762 --> 53:44.762
Please.

53:45.598 --> 53:47.849
Tell me how she can survive this.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.006
Death.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.691
I'm not gonna let it hurt you.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.989
Carlisle will get that thing out.

54:55.417 --> 54:56.584
Thing?

55:20.693 --> 55:23.236
Wait here while we load.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.430
- Hello?
- Rosalie.

55:50.514 --> 55:51.681
Bella?

55:55.602 --> 55:57.770
-What's going on?
-l need your help.

56:23.297 --> 56:24.839
Hey, Son.

56:24.923 --> 56:25.965
What's going on?

56:27.051 --> 56:28.217
Bella called him.

56:31.472 --> 56:34.057
Hey, haven't seen you in a while.

56:35.059 --> 56:37.351
-You okay?
-So, you finally heard from Bella?

56:40.397 --> 56:41.939
They're extending their trip.

56:42.024 --> 56:43.566
Seems she caught a bug.

56:43.650 --> 56:46.486
They wanna wait until she feels better
before they travel.

56:47.488 --> 56:48.696
She's sick.

56:48.781 --> 56:52.116
Yeah, she told me not to worry,
but she sounded,

56:54.369 --> 56:57.163
l don't know, off.

56:57.790 --> 56:59.082
She'll be okay, Charlie.

57:00.542 --> 57:01.834
Come on. Let's eat.

57:13.180 --> 57:15.848
Jacob, let it go.

57:36.537 --> 57:37.620
ls it true?

57:37.704 --> 57:39.539
Hello, Jacob, how are you?

57:40.332 --> 57:42.542
Listen, just give it to me straight.

57:42.668 --> 57:44.335
Jake, is that you?

57:46.213 --> 57:49.048
-She's here?
-They came home two weeks ago.

57:49.758 --> 57:50.925
Jake.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.947
I'm glad you came.

58:15.242 --> 58:17.535
-Close enough.
-What's your problem?

58:18.662 --> 58:20.413
Rose, it's okay.

58:31.258 --> 58:32.758
You look terrible.

58:35.596 --> 58:38.764
Yeah, it's nice to see you, too.

58:42.644 --> 58:44.395
So, are you gonna tell me
what's wrong with you?

58:47.733 --> 58:49.275
Rose, you wanna help me up?

59:08.587 --> 59:09.754
You did this!

59:10.088 --> 59:12.632
We didn't know it was even possible.

59:13.175 --> 59:14.717
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.845
Ultrasounds and needles
won't penetrate the embryonic sac.

59:17.930 --> 59:19.847
l can't see it, either.

59:21.725 --> 59:23.601
And l can't see Bella's future anymore.

59:24.895 --> 59:27.438
We've been researching legends,
but there isn't much to go on.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.357
What we do know is that it's strong.

59:29.650 --> 59:30.942
And fast-growing.

59:31.026 --> 59:33.653
Why haven't you done anything?
Take it out of her!

59:34.279 --> 59:36.072
This is none of your business, dog.

59:36.156 --> 59:37.448
Rose!

59:37.699 --> 59:39.450
All this fighting isn't good for Bella.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.661
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

59:41.745 --> 59:46.290
Say the word, Alice. "Baby."
It's just a little baby.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.668
Possibly.

59:50.545 --> 59:52.672
Carlisle, you've gotta do something.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.257
No.

59:55.008 --> 59:57.343
It's not his decision. It's not any of yours.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.220
Jacob, l need to talk to you.

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:13.067
l always knew you'd destroy her.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:19.240
She thinks Carlisle can turn her
at the last minute,

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.866
like he did for me and Esme.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:26.122
-Can he?
-Probability is slight.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.793
And if her heart fails...

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:39.635
Look, Jacob,
l need you to do something for me.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:42.888
For her.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.313
You have a connection with her
that I'll never understand.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:53.649
Maybe you could talk to her,
change her mind.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.779
You can keep her alive.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:02.366
And if l can't?

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:05.369
If she dies,

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.168
you get what you always wanted.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:14.712
To kill me.

01:01:25.766 --> 01:01:27.892
Rose, I'm fine, really.

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:50.706
-So, Edward sent you in here to talk to me?
-Sort of.

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:53.918
Though l can't figure out
why he thinks you'd listen to me.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.544
l mean, you never have before.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:05.763
Since when are you and blondie BFFs?

01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:08.307
Rose understands what l want.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.648
What are you thinking, Bella?

01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:17.316
Seriously.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.403
l know this seems like a scary thing,

01:02:21.822 --> 01:02:23.364
but it's not.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.742
It's like this miracle or something.

01:02:28.537 --> 01:02:29.703
l can feel him.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.749
So, it's a bouncing baby boy.

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.419
I'm sorry l didn't know.
Should've brought some blue balloons.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:38.337
It's just a guess.

01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:41.632
When l picture him, l see a boy.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:44.677
We'll see.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.638
You won't.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.515
Jake, l can do this.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:53.519
-I'm strong enough.
-Come on.

01:02:54.855 --> 01:02:58.858
You can spout that crap to your
bloodsucker, but you don't fool me.

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:02.778
l can see what that thing's doing to you.
It's a killer, Bella.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:05.823
-You're wrong.
-And when you die,

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:10.953
what was the point?
Of me loving you, you loving him.

01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.913
How is that right for anyone?

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.832
Because l sure don't see it.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.217
Listen to me, Bella.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.552
Please.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.597
Just don't do this.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.975
Live, okay?

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.269
Please.

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:38.731
Jake, everything's gonna be okay.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.828
Jacob, don't go.

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:55.706
l know how this ends.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.711
And I'm not sticking around to watch.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:40.376
Jacob.
Jake, I can do this. I can do this.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.294
Don't do this.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:43.837
I'm strong enough.
I'm strong enough.

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:46.382
This is none
of your business, dog.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.133
Jacob, don't go.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:49.843
You did this!

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:51.887
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:04:51.972 --> 01:04:54.056
The fetus isn't good for Bella.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.975
I know how this ends.

01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:59.144
Don't you even care that it's killing you?

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:40.060
Jake! Jake! Jake!

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.396
Jake! Jake! Jake!

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.817
- Is it true, Jacob?
- What will it be?

01:05:46.901 --> 01:05:47.943
It's growing fast.

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:49.612
- It's unnatural.
- Dangerous.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:51.614
- Monstrosity.
- An abomination.

01:05:51.698 --> 01:05:53.365
On our land.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.659
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:58.662
- We can't allow it.
- We can't allow it.

01:05:58.747 --> 01:06:00.581
We have to protect the tribe.

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:04.501
What they've bred
won't be able to control its thirst.

01:06:04.586 --> 01:06:06.503
Every human will be in danger.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.881
- We're ready.
- No time to waste.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.007
Now?

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.010
We must destroy it before it's born.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.720
You mean, kill Bella?

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:17.473
Her choice affects us all.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:20.809
Bella's human.
Our protection applies to her.

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.811
She's dying anyway!

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.526
We have real enemies to fight tonight.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.028
Tonight?

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:36.116
You will fight with us, Jake.

01:06:55.804 --> 01:07:00.015
l will not.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:04.895
I am the grandson of Ephraim Black.

01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:07.940
I am the grandson of a chief!

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:13.028
I wasn't born to follow you, or anyone else.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:46.937
Whoa.

01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:52.526
Don't worry. They're not following us.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.652
What do you think you're doing here?

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.488
-l left Sam's pack.
-Go home, Seth.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.949
-l won't stand behind him.
-Oh, yes, you will.

01:07:59.617 --> 01:08:02.035
I'm not kidding. Get out of here.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:07.082
ls that an order?
Gonna make me bow down, too?

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.251
I'm not ordering anyone.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:12.713
Look, I'm just going off
on my own here, okay?

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:15.048
Great, and I've got your back.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:16.258
No, you don't.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:21.596
If Sam comes after Bella,

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.725
are you really ready
to fight your own brothers?

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:26.059
Your sister?

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:29.520
If it's the right thing to do.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:34.693
Whatever.

01:08:35.694 --> 01:08:38.572
I'm gonna go give the Cullens a heads-up.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.365
Do what you want.

01:08:44.287 --> 01:08:49.082
How cool is this? Two-man pack.
Two against the world.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.959
You're getting on my nerves, Seth.

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:53.796
I'll shut up. Can do.

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.010
Get ready.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.304
They're coming for Bella.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:06.225
They're not gonna touch her.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.518
Agreed.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.609
Man, l can smell them
from all the way out here.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:18.237
What the hell are you doing here?

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.697
I'm not gonna let my little brother
get himself killed.

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:23.116
Go away, Leah! l can take care of myself.

01:09:23.201 --> 01:09:25.493
That you think so
proves you need a babysitter.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:26.787
Okay, would the both of you shut up?

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:30.916
Did Sam send you?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.835
Sam doesn't even know l left.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.175
l think he just figured it out.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:42.719
Jake.

01:09:44.055 --> 01:09:45.764
l know what his plan is.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.017
Sam's lost the element of surprise,

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:50.853
and he doesn't want
to take you on outnumbered,

01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.688
so he's not gonna come at you head on.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:55.858
He's got the place surrounded
and he'll wait for his opportunity.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:57.234
We won't get through without a fight.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.236
No fights.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.654
We won't be the ones to break the treaty.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:03.824
The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.117
Not in ours.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.245
Carlisle, no one's hunted for weeks.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:12.416
We'll make do.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.211
You've done us a great service, Jacob.

01:10:16.296 --> 01:10:17.796
Thank you.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:53.332
l know they're out there somewhere,
but l can't hear them anymore.

01:10:54.876 --> 01:10:56.627
It's so quiet.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:01.548
l stopped hearing them, too,
the second l decided to leave.

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:05.385
It's nice.

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:08.597
You know you can't stay here.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:11.475
-But l don't have any place...
-l can't trust you with the Cullens.

01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:13.518
You hate them too much.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:15.604
You don't even like me.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:17.397
l don't have to.

01:11:18.983 --> 01:11:20.859
l just have to follow you.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:26.239
Look, Seth doesn't want you here.
Neither do l.

01:11:29.911 --> 01:11:33.080
Being unwanted isn't exactly
a new thing for me.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.765
Look, I'll stay out of your way.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.266
I'll do whatever you want,

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:57.688
except go back to Sam's pack and be the
pathetic ex-girlfriend he can't get away from.

01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:03.318
You don't know how many times
l wished l could imprint on someone.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.153
Anyone.

01:12:07.949 --> 01:12:09.783
Just to break the connection.

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:26.008
All right.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.346
I'm gonna do a perimeter run.
You got my flank?

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.442
God and his priests and his kings

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:52.868
All will wait

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:55.662
As they go on

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.459
Mmm-mmm

01:13:01.335 --> 01:13:04.129
Held between heaven and hell

01:13:06.049 --> 01:13:10.719
As they're dancing

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:14.097
As they don't

01:13:30.907 --> 01:13:34.826
Cold

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:48.924
Your rib is cracked.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:54.262
But there are no splinters.
You haven't punctured anything.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.515
-Yet.
-Edward.

01:13:58.643 --> 01:14:00.977
It's breaking her bones now.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.022
It's crushing you from the inside out.

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:09.820
Carlisle, tell her what you told me. Tell her.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.325
Carlisle, tell me. It's all right.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:28.213
The fetus isn't compatible with your body.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.843
It's too strong.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:35.387
lt won't allow you to get
the nutrition you need.

01:14:35.972 --> 01:14:37.305
It's starving you by the hour.

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.558
l can't stop it, and l can't slow it down.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.522
At this rate, your heart will give out
before you can deliver.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:52.112
Then I'll hold on as long as l can, and then...

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:54.156
Bella.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.783
There are some conditions
that even venom can't overcome.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.077
You understand?

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.038
I'm sorry.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.345
Edward, I'm sorry.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:19.764
l can't live without you.

01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:21.933
You won't. You're gonna have a part of me.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:23.518
He'll need you.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:30.859
Do you honestly think that l could love it
or even tolerate it if it killed you?

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.277
It's not his fault.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:35.197
You have to accept what is.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.282
Because you've given me no choice!

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.827
Bella, we're supposed to be partners,
remember?

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:43.955
But you decided this on your own.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.498
You've decided to leave me.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.292
Don't see it that way.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.127
Well, l have no other way to see it.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:50.545
'Cause it's me who'll lose you.

01:15:51.339 --> 01:15:52.464
And l don't choose that.

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.134
l don't choose that.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:25.121
Cold

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:32.337
Sing for the lion and lamb

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.884
Yours completely

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:41.304
Yours

01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:44.724
As we go over

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.980
Sing for the lion and lamb

01:16:50.523 --> 01:16:52.023
Washington driving in the red zone.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:54.693
Almost stripped of the ball.
He stood up and Calvin finally...

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:58.613
Are you cold?

01:16:59.699 --> 01:17:01.032
l got it.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:09.541
Don't do that.

01:17:11.043 --> 01:17:12.252
What?

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:15.588
Smile like I'm your favorite person
in the world.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.008
You're one of them.

01:17:20.428 --> 01:17:23.013
Feels complete when you're here, Jake.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:40.613
We need to find a way
to get some food into her system.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.909
-If l could only see the fetus...
-The baby.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:47.287
...maybe l could figure out what it wants.

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:57.213
Think you might be right.

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.631
Jacob just had an idea.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:04.471
lt wasn't an idea. lt was a snide comment.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.181
What were you thinking?

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.559
That it's probably just looking for someone
to sink its teeth into.

01:18:20.112 --> 01:18:21.446
He's thirsty.

01:18:24.075 --> 01:18:25.533
l know the feeling.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.579
If it's craving,
it's not gonna want animal blood.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.664
l have some O negative laid aside for Bella.

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:35.752
Walk with me.

01:18:56.816 --> 01:18:57.857
Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:57.942 --> 01:18:59.359
You're gonna make her drink that?

01:18:59.944 --> 01:19:02.862
It's the fastest way to test the theory.

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:04.489
Only if you're comfortable with it.

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.699
I'll try anything.

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.619
Just hold on.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.164
l think I'm gonna be sick.

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:23.341
This might make it a little easier to take.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:55.415
Tastes

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.003
good.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.725
Mmm.

01:20:23.277 --> 01:20:25.487
Your pulse is already getting stronger.

01:20:27.114 --> 01:20:28.698
It's working.

01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:53.014
- Well, you sound better.
l am.

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:54.682
l feel much better.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:57.727
This whole thing must've put a kink
in the honeymoon, huh?

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:00.563
You could say that.

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:03.608
Otherwise, married life treating you okay?

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:06.611
Edward still walks on water and all that?

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.656
Yeah, but, l mean, it is different now.

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.824
The important thing is that you're better.

01:21:11.909 --> 01:21:14.327
And that you're coming home soon, right?

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:17.247
Okay, Dad, l don't want you to freak out,

01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:22.627
but I'm going to a medical center
in Switzerland.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.338
What? No, no, you're not.
You're not going to Switzerland.

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:26.839
What are you... You said you were better.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:28.132
I am.

01:21:28.592 --> 01:21:30.885
No, Bella. I'm getting on a plane. No.

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.011
No.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:36.724
It's really more of a spa.

01:21:37.476 --> 01:21:40.937
And I'm sure that I'd be better
by the time you got there anyway.

01:21:41.021 --> 01:21:43.147
Bells... l don't know.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:44.607
Dad, don't come.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:46.734
And picture me healthy,

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:49.737
like I'm sitting on the couch with you,
eating pizza or something.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:51.823
You want me to visualize?

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.032
They say that it helps.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:55.994
Just picture me like that.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.414
Like l was.

01:21:59.498 --> 01:22:01.541
It'll make me feel better.

01:22:03.127 --> 01:22:04.586
Dad, l got to go, okay?

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:05.837
Bella.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:07.422
l love you.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:08.881
Bella...

01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:31.279
I'm sorry I've been so angry.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:34.198
l would be, too.

01:22:34.867 --> 01:22:37.076
I've left you alone in this.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:44.292
Marriage.

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.924
Well, they say the first year is the hardest.

01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.890
Who was that?

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:00.475
What?

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.060
l thought l just heard...

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:04.979
Just say something else.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.565
Like what?

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:12.236
Edward, what's going on?

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.366
He likes the sound of your voice.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.201
You can hear him?

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:19.952
In mind.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:25.917
He likes my voice as well.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.085
What?

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:29.420
What do you hear?

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:31.839
It's so strange.

01:23:31.924 --> 01:23:34.967
l thought he was like me, but he's not.
He's like you.

01:23:35.386 --> 01:23:38.179
Good and pure.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:40.556
He's happy.

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:45.311
Of course you are.

01:23:45.396 --> 01:23:48.106
Of course you're happy.
How could you not be?

01:23:49.066 --> 01:23:51.317
l love you so much.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.946
What do you hear now?

01:23:55.406 --> 01:23:56.989
He loves you, Bella.

01:23:59.159 --> 01:24:00.743
Oh, my gosh.

01:24:34.445 --> 01:24:35.862
Jacob.

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:47.248
So, that's the last of it?

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:49.292
Bella could deliver as early as tomorrow.

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:51.544
If she's going to have any chance at all,
she'll need more blood.

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:53.087
And you need to feed.

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:55.798
You have to be at your strongest for her.
We need to go tonight.

01:24:56.175 --> 01:24:58.634
Carlisle, you're the enemy now.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:01.262
Sam won't hesitate. You will be slaughtered.

01:25:01.346 --> 01:25:03.139
Emmett will come with us.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.641
- That won't be enough.
- We have no choice, Jacob.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:08.269
If there's anything we can do to save her,
we have to try.

01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:11.939
-You'd risk your lives for her?
-Of course we would.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:13.691
Bella's a part of our family now.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:16.652
Yeah.

01:25:17.863 --> 01:25:19.405
l can see that.

01:25:20.908 --> 01:25:22.700
This really is a family.

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:28.956
As strong as the one l was born into.

01:25:31.710 --> 01:25:33.127
l know what l have to do.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.609
Jake! They're coming.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:57.777
l know.

01:25:57.861 --> 01:26:00.571
We should phase, Jacob.
We can't protect ourselves like this.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:02.657
They'll see it as a threat.

01:26:03.075 --> 01:26:04.742
l wanna talk!

01:26:05.369 --> 01:26:07.245
Be easier if l could hear you, too.

01:26:16.839 --> 01:26:18.256
This isn't your territory anymore.

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:22.093
-How's the new family working out?
-You done?

01:26:23.971 --> 01:26:25.263
You coming home, Jake?

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:27.849
Not until l finish this.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.267
What do you mean?

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.644
l want Sam to take back Leah and Seth.

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.396
- What?
- No way!

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.522
Quiet!

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.109
l want them safe.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:40.611
And l want this over.

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:54.792
l need Sam to wait until Bella's
been separated from the problem.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.127
You mean till she's dead.

01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.295
Ease up, Paul.

01:26:58.714 --> 01:26:59.755
Then what?

01:27:00.465 --> 01:27:04.719
Tell Sam that when the moment comes,
I'll be the one to destroy it.

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:06.012
Jake!

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.307
I'm the only one who can.

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:11.642
They trust me.

01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:10.618
You played us?

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:28.344
Can't we come up with something
just a little more classic?

01:28:32.557 --> 01:28:33.724
Thank you.

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.811
-They make it out all right?
-Yeah.

01:28:36.895 --> 01:28:38.187
Good.

01:28:47.739 --> 01:28:48.781
Hey.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.034
Are you okay?

01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:54.245
Yeah, it's not like I'm the one
carrying a demon.

01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:57.707
This is pretty important, Bella.

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.834
Why don't you tell Jacob
what you've decided?

01:29:00.293 --> 01:29:01.419
What now?

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:05.756
Rose is trying to talk Bella
out of her baby names.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:07.758
She hates them.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:10.428
Well, then I'm on your side
no matter what you picked.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.888
They're not that bad.

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:14.640
If it's a boy, EJ.

01:29:16.435 --> 01:29:17.476
Edward Jacob.

01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:22.606
Okay, fine, that one's not awful.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:26.444
Why don't you tell him the girl's name?

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:30.406
l was playing around with our moms' names.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:32.366
Renée and Esme.

01:29:32.451 --> 01:29:33.784
And l was thinking...

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:42.334
Renesmee.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:47.423
Too weird?

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.801
No, that's not too weird.

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:53.512
It's beautiful.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:58.601
And it's unique,
which certainly fits the situation.

01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:02.605
l like Renesmee.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:08.944
He likes it.

01:30:30.884 --> 01:30:33.469
Rosalie, pass the morphine.

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.348
Carlisle said the placenta
must have detached.

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.478
-He's coming as fast as he can, but...
-We'll have to do it.

01:30:45.482 --> 01:30:48.275
Rose! Let the morphine spread.

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.027
There's no time. He's dying.

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:52.071
Get him out now!

01:30:53.698 --> 01:30:54.698
Look at me, Bella.

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:04.834
Rosalie, don't!

01:31:06.169 --> 01:31:07.294
Alice, get her out of here!

01:31:07.379 --> 01:31:09.421
Rosalie!

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:12.716
Ow!

01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:14.135
Save her! You've got to change her!

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.386
l can't, not whilst he's still in there.

01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:16.929
l got to get him out first.

01:31:18.098 --> 01:31:21.016
Stay, Bella. Stay focused.
Keep your heart beating.

01:31:21.101 --> 01:31:22.935
No! He's suffocating!

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:38.450
Okay.

01:31:59.181 --> 01:32:00.764
Hey.

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:02.266
Hey, hey.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:05.102
It's Renesmee.

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:16.697
You're beautiful.

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.180
Hey.

01:32:54.903 --> 01:32:56.570
Bella?

01:32:56.947 --> 01:32:58.155
Bella?

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:01.408
Bella!

01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:08.958
Jacob, take the baby.

01:33:09.584 --> 01:33:11.252
Keep that away from me!

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:12.920
Edward.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:14.838
I'll take her.

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:18.092
l promise I'm okay. Let me.

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:27.017
What is that?

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:32.648
It's my venom.

01:33:45.704 --> 01:33:48.038
You're okay.

01:33:50.792 --> 01:33:52.042
Come on.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.635
It's supposed to be working.

01:34:03.596 --> 01:34:04.888
Oh, my God.

01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.390
Come on.

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:09.977
Bella, come on.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:17.359
l won't kill you.

01:34:17.444 --> 01:34:19.653
That'd be too easy.

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:22.448
You deserve to live with this.

01:34:57.734 --> 01:34:58.942
She didn't make it.

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.918
You're not dead. You're not dead.

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:21.799
Come on!

01:35:29.307 --> 01:35:32.184
No, it will work. lt will work.

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:34.978
Please, please, please, please.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:22.276
Come back to me, please, baby.

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:25.195
Bella, Bella, please, please.

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.165
Hi, hi.

01:36:56.269 --> 01:36:58.395
l don't care what he's done.

01:36:59.022 --> 01:37:01.857
-He's still my son.
-I'm sorry, Billy.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:03.901
l just thought you should know.

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:11.241
Bella's dead.

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:14.161
lt killed her.

01:37:17.248 --> 01:37:19.249
Let's go!

01:38:07.465 --> 01:38:10.634
It's like gravity.

01:38:11.511 --> 01:38:13.929
Your whole center shifts.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:19.184
Suddenly, it's not the Earth
holding you here.

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:25.065
You would do anything,
be anything she needs.

01:38:27.277 --> 01:38:30.654
A friend, a brother.

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.490
A protector.

01:38:54.596 --> 01:38:57.222
Alice! Jasper!

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:05.022
You're gonna be all right.

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:19.786
-We're outnumbered.
-By a lot.

01:39:19.871 --> 01:39:21.705
l won't let them hurt my family.

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:41.451
Stop! It's over!

01:40:42.954 --> 01:40:44.705
If you kill her, you kill me.

01:40:59.679 --> 01:41:00.887
Jacob imprinted.

01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:07.352
They can't hurt her.

01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:12.107
Whoever a wolf imprints on can't be harmed.

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:19.156
It's their most absolute law.

01:41:55.067 --> 01:41:58.111
She shouldn't be this still.

01:41:58.196 --> 01:41:59.446
It's the morphine.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.784
- Maybe l was too late.
- No, Edward.

01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.453
Listen to her heart.

01:45:10.054 --> 01:45:12.806
Sitting pretty uptightly

01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:16.601
The knots keep you at my side

01:45:16.686 --> 01:45:19.813
Upstairs, in corners

01:45:19.897 --> 01:45:22.691
Eyes blink for the crawl

01:45:22.775 --> 01:45:28.196
Up and out
My beacon will choke

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:32.826
If yours is taken
I dare four more lines

01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:36.037
Four more lines

01:45:36.831 --> 01:45:46.840
Sellotape an end to

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:50.051
Sellotape an end

01:45:50.136 --> 01:45:53.888
Hover thought
Mosquito

01:45:53.973 --> 01:45:55.682
Bite down

01:45:55.766 --> 01:46:00.437
My fickle hands machine
Surprises

01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:07.485
Sellotape an end to a story that is hanging

01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:12.824
Over silence always wasted

01:46:12.908 --> 01:46:16.202
Swells with every teardrop

01:46:16.287 --> 01:46:19.622
Pulls my threads to kid gloves

01:46:19.707 --> 01:46:23.668
Sellotape an end to this

01:47:03.459 --> 01:47:06.461
Now I'm the guilty one

01:47:07.963 --> 01:47:09.214
Hey!

01:47:09.298 --> 01:47:11.883
Give me my sentence

01:47:11.967 --> 01:47:14.344
I'll pay my penance

01:47:14.428 --> 01:47:16.596
Let me kill them all

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.350
And the pain I have for hurting you

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:25.188
I didn't mean it

01:47:28.192 --> 01:47:29.651
Ah. It's from Carlisle.

01:47:31.195 --> 01:47:36.658
Which is spelt with an "S," Sweet Bianca.

01:47:42.123 --> 01:47:45.458
He's added a new member to his coven.

01:47:45.543 --> 01:47:46.626
Ah.

01:47:46.710 --> 01:47:49.129
Increasing his power.

01:47:58.055 --> 01:48:00.056
First it's the spelling,

01:48:00.808 --> 01:48:02.433
then the grammar.

01:48:05.062 --> 01:48:09.816
At least our dispute with the Cullens is over.

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.694
-Over?
-Mmm.

01:48:12.778 --> 01:48:13.987
Goodness, no.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:20.368
Our dispute goes far beyond
the fate of a mere human.

01:48:21.704 --> 01:48:23.079
And what might it be?

01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:26.374
Why, brother, l thought you understood.

01:48:28.252 --> 01:48:30.503
They have something l want.

01:48:36.427 --> 01:48:39.804
If you ever leave me, baby

01:48:42.808 --> 01:48:45.935
Leave some morphine at my door

01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:54.110
'Cause it would take
a whole lot of medication

01:48:55.029 --> 01:49:01.784
To realize what we used to have,
we don't have it anymore

01:49:01.869 --> 01:49:05.622
There's no religion that could save me

01:49:07.791 --> 01:49:11.794
No matter how long
my knees are on the floor

01:49:14.215 --> 01:49:18.760
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making

01:49:20.429 --> 01:49:26.226
Will keep you by my side
Will keep you from walking out the door

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:29.896
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:33.066
If I lose you, baby

01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:36.027
There'll be no clear skies

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:39.364
If I lose you, baby

01:49:39.448 --> 01:49:44.994
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

01:49:45.079 --> 01:49:47.747
If you walk away

01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:53.169
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

01:50:08.894 --> 01:50:12.855
I'll never be your mother's favorite

01:50:14.858 --> 01:50:18.528
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye

01:50:21.532 --> 01:50:27.412
If I was in their shoes,
I'd be doing the same thing

01:50:27.496 --> 01:50:29.872
Saying there goes my little girl

01:50:29.957 --> 01:50:33.376
Walking with that troublesome guy

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:38.715
But they're just afraid
of something they can't understand

01:50:40.592 --> 01:50:44.512
But little darling,
watch me change their minds

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:50.310
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:56.149
I'll pick up these broken pieces
till I'm bleeding

01:50:56.233 --> 01:50:59.152
If that'll make you mine

01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:02.613
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

01:51:02.698 --> 01:51:05.992
If I lose you, baby

01:51:06.076 --> 01:51:08.995
There'll be no clear skies

01:51:09.079 --> 01:51:12.165
If I lose you, baby

01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:17.712
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

01:51:17.796 --> 01:51:20.631
If you walk away

01:51:20.716 --> 01:51:25.928
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

01:51:40.027 --> 01:51:51.454
Don't just say goodbye

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.959
I'll pick up these broken pieces
till I'm bleeding

01:51:57.044 --> 01:51:59.545
If that'll make it right

01:52:00.255 --> 01:52:03.549
'Cause there'll be no sunlight

01:52:03.634 --> 01:52:06.636
If I lose you, baby

01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:10.014
There'll be no clear skies

01:52:10.099 --> 01:52:13.017
If I lose you, baby

01:52:13.102 --> 01:52:18.523
Just like the clouds,
my eyes will do the same

01:52:18.607 --> 01:52:21.401
If you walk away

01:52:21.485 --> 01:52:26.364
Every day it will rain, rain, rain

01:53:02.526 --> 01:53:06.446
Heart beats fast

01:53:06.530 --> 01:53:11.534
Colors and promises

01:53:11.618 --> 01:53:14.162
How to be brave

01:53:14.246 --> 01:53:19.292
How can I love when I'm afraid

01:53:19.376 --> 01:53:21.752
To fall

01:53:21.837 --> 01:53:26.966
But watching you stand alone

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.093
All of my doubt

01:53:29.178 --> 01:53:34.557
Suddenly goes away somehow

01:53:35.934 --> 01:53:40.229
One step closer

01:53:43.775 --> 01:53:48.988
I have died every day waiting for you

01:53:49.072 --> 01:53:53.701
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

01:53:53.785 --> 01:53:57.872
For a thousand years

01:53:57.956 --> 01:54:03.211
I'll love you for a thousand more

01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:13.429
Time stands still

01:54:13.514 --> 01:54:18.684
Beauty in all she is

01:54:18.769 --> 01:54:21.229
I will be brave

01:54:21.313 --> 01:54:27.485
I will not let anything take away

01:54:29.071 --> 01:54:33.908
What's standing in front of me

01:54:33.992 --> 01:54:36.702
Every breath

01:54:36.787 --> 01:54:41.123
Every hour has come to this

01:54:43.126 --> 01:54:48.297
One step closer

01:54:50.968 --> 01:54:56.013
I have died every day waiting for you

01:54:56.098 --> 01:55:00.726
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

01:55:00.811 --> 01:55:04.981
For a thousand years

01:55:05.065 --> 01:55:10.820
I'll love you for a thousand more

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:16.909
And all along I believed I would find you

01:55:16.994 --> 01:55:21.706
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:25.835
For a thousand years

01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:31.007
I'll love you for a thousand more

01:55:55.824 --> 01:56:10.379
One step closer

01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:18.929
I have died every day waiting for you

01:56:19.014 --> 01:56:23.851
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you

01:56:23.935 --> 01:56:27.855
For a thousand years

01:56:27.939 --> 01:56:32.568
I'll love you for a thousand more

01:56:34.696 --> 01:56:39.825
And all along I believed I would find you

01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:44.538
Time has brought your heart to me
I have loved you

01:56:44.623 --> 01:56:48.751
For a thousand years

01:56:48.835 --> 01:56:54.048
I'll love you for a thousand more
