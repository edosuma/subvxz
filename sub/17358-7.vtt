13:22.379 --> 13:23.981
Anyway, he barely spent
time with his family

13:40.464 --> 13:41.965
by becoming a sushi chef

13:41.965 --> 13:43.100
that you would be rebelling

13:43.100 --> 13:44.067

13:44.067 --> 13:45.502
Rebelling? Oh, no.

17:33.145 --> 17:34.447
who can talk to ghosts.

17:34.447 --> 17:36.248
But I was thinking with
a little quick pitch,

17:36.248 --> 17:38.551
I could make it kind of a father-son

17:38.551 --> 17:39.819
dynamic duo kind of thing?

17:39.819 --> 17:41.153
- No, no. I...
- No, no, no. I want to!

17:41.153 --> 17:42.421
I want to.

17:42.421 --> 17:43.422
Hang on. I'm gonna call the President

17:43.422 --> 17:44.457
of Alt TV right now.

17:44.457 --> 17:45.558
I'm gonna pitch it to him.

17:45.558 --> 17:46.559
Just let me do it.

17:46.559 --> 17:47.593
No.

17:47.593 --> 17:49.695
Yes, shut up.

17:49.695 --> 17:51.597
(telephone rings)

17:51.597 --> 17:52.565
Yeah?

17:52.565 --> 17:54.200
Uh, Mr. Cheeseburgerstein?

17:54.200 --> 17:56.535
It's Kevin Pacalioglu, from Fat Psychic.

17:56.535 --> 17:57.737
- Fat Psychic?
- Yeah, I know.

17:57.737 --> 17:59.238
We should probably consider

17:59.238 --> 18:00.439
changing the title because technically

18:00.439 --> 18:02.475
I'm not really, uh, psychic.

18:02.475 --> 18:05.277
Yeah, uh, look, Mr. Pacalioglu...

18:05.277 --> 18:06.679
I'm sorry, I'm wasting your time.

18:06.679 --> 18:08.781
Uh, so I'm standing here with my dad...

18:08.781 --> 18:11.450
- Hi!
- He says hi. That was him.

18:11.450 --> 18:13.085
And, uh, I was just thinking maybe

18:13.085 --> 18:14.387
we could get him on the show,

18:14.387 --> 18:16.355
you know, sort of like
a father-son duo thing?

18:16.355 --> 18:18.557
- Like a team?
- I can't.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.493
Look, it's not gonna happen.

18:20.493 --> 18:21.494
Oh.

18:21.494 --> 18:23.262
Oh, really?

18:23.262 --> 18:25.131
I beg you to reconsider.

18:25.131 --> 18:26.499
He's a very striking gentleman,

18:26.499 --> 18:28.401
he's very camera-friendly,

18:28.401 --> 18:30.169
smart, he's got a great head of hair...

18:30.169 --> 18:31.671
a natural brunette, as far as I know.

18:31.671 --> 18:33.105
I don't dye it!

18:33.105 --> 18:34.273
He doesn't dye his hair, who does?

18:34.273 --> 18:35.374
He's a good-looking guy!

18:35.374 --> 18:36.609
No, I mean the show.

18:36.609 --> 18:38.377
The show's not gonna happen.

18:38.377 --> 18:40.246
You've been cancelled.

18:40.246 --> 18:42.148
Uh... what?

18:42.148 --> 18:43.516
What'd I do wrong?

18:43.516 --> 18:45.117
You didn't do anything wrong, my boy.

18:45.117 --> 18:48.754
It's just the nature of showbiz!

18:48.754 --> 18:51.590
Bloody tell me when you're about to finish!

18:51.590 --> 18:54.593
You completely ghosted me!

18:54.593 --> 18:57.329
Uh, I gotta go.

19:02.268 --> 19:04.704
Well, uh.

19:04.704 --> 19:06.439
I guess, uh, Fat Psychic's

19:06.439 --> 19:08.574
been cancelled.

19:08.574 --> 19:10.643
- Cancelled?
- Yeah.

19:10.643 --> 19:14.213
I actually had a dream
about this happening.

19:14.213 --> 19:15.781
But, hey, on the bright side, you know,

19:15.781 --> 19:17.483
you and me can hang
out a lot more together.

19:17.483 --> 19:18.584
We can do some real ghost cases.

19:18.584 --> 19:22.584
Fuck!

19:24.824 --> 19:26.125
What? No. Don't...

19:26.125 --> 19:27.693
Don't do that! No, no!

19:27.693 --> 19:29.128
You know, then we can maybe join

19:29.128 --> 19:30.296
one of those father-son sack races

19:30.296 --> 19:31.564
you were talking about?

19:31.564 --> 19:34.567
What the fuck is a father-son sack race?

19:34.567 --> 19:36.669
That doesn't even physically make sense!

19:36.669 --> 19:38.204
It's not a three-legged race;

19:38.204 --> 19:39.438
it's not a sack race.

19:39.438 --> 19:41.040
So what is it?

19:41.040 --> 19:43.642
I guess it's a race for your nutsacks?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.311
Or you put your nuts in a bag?

19:45.311 --> 19:46.579
I don't know!

19:46.579 --> 19:49.281
(groans)

19:49.281 --> 19:51.484
All right.

19:51.484 --> 19:53.519
I'm going back to LA.

19:53.519 --> 19:54.854
Oh, what do you mean? You just got here!

19:54.914 --> 19:55.915
I only came here

19:55.915 --> 19:59.251
for the goddamn TV show!

19:59.251 --> 20:00.886
You knew about that the whole time?

20:00.886 --> 20:02.354
I read the trades.

20:02.354 --> 20:03.722
What are the trades?

20:03.722 --> 20:05.558
They're the showbiz industry journals!

20:05.558 --> 20:07.760
I don't know that! I just got into showbiz.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.562
It's early for me.

20:09.562 --> 20:11.397
What about the haunted apartment?

20:11.397 --> 20:12.765
I only rented that haunted apartment

20:12.765 --> 20:14.200
so I would have an excuse

20:14.200 --> 20:18.404
to bond with you, ya dumb fuck.

20:18.404 --> 20:20.139
What about... what about the blowfish?

20:20.139 --> 20:22.541
What about the blowfish?

20:24.643 --> 20:26.612
Ta-da!

20:26.612 --> 20:29.215
Oldest trick in the book.

♪

20:33.686 --> 20:36.155

♪

20:49.491 --> 20:51.126
Hey.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.464
Why are you staring at nothing?

20:55.464 --> 20:57.833
Because I lost everything.

20:57.833 --> 21:00.002
What do you mean?

21:00.002 --> 21:02.371
Well, I guess first off,

21:02.371 --> 21:04.907
my TV show got cancelled.

21:04.907 --> 21:05.974
So that was fun.

21:05.974 --> 21:07.543
And then my dad told me

21:07.543 --> 21:09.378
that he was only here to be

21:09.378 --> 21:11.480
on that TV show,

21:11.480 --> 21:13.382
threw a piece of fish in my face,

21:13.382 --> 21:16.084
and called me gullible, and left,

21:16.084 --> 21:18.787
so I lost him too.

21:18.787 --> 21:20.222
And I guess at the moment I'm just feeling

21:20.222 --> 21:22.524
like a big, fat, idiot loser.

21:22.524 --> 21:23.992
Stop that!

21:23.992 --> 21:25.894
You're not an idiot or a loser.

21:25.894 --> 21:27.829
You're a great guy with a big heart

21:27.829 --> 21:29.565
who helps people.

21:29.565 --> 21:31.967
People who can't help themselves.

21:31.967 --> 21:34.136
Ghosts.

21:34.136 --> 21:35.437

21:35.437 --> 21:37.039
to prove that.
