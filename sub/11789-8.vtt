WEBVTT

00:55.280 --> 00:59.284
>> OH, MY GOD. IS THAT ME?

00:59.290 --> 01:00.382
>> YOUR REFLECTION MAY BE

01:00.390 --> 01:01.459
SHOCKING FOR A WHILE, BUT YOU'LL

01:01.460 --> 01:03.257
GET USED TO IT. I ACTUALLY THINK

01:03.260 --> 01:05.228
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.697
>> THANKS. IT FEELS LIKE A

01:06.700 --> 01:09.760
STRANGER IS STARING BACK AT ME.

01:09.770 --> 01:10.759
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I'M

01:10.770 --> 01:12.431
SUPPOSED TO TAKE A SHOWER. I

01:12.440 --> 01:13.464
CAN'T LET THIS GIRL SEE ME

01:13.470 --> 01:15.563
NAKED. I BARELY KNOW HER.

01:15.570 --> 01:16.764
>> HOW DO YOU LIKE IT, AUSTIN? I

01:16.770 --> 01:18.431
THINK DR. MCNAMARA DID A BANG-UP

01:18.440 --> 01:19.702
JOB.

01:19.710 --> 01:20.574
>> WHEN IS IT GONNA STOP

01:20.580 --> 01:21.308
HURTING?

01:21.310 --> 01:22.402
>> IN A WEEK YOU'LL BE TAKING

01:22.410 --> 01:23.843
NOTHING BUT ASPIRIN, IF THAT.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.738
>> WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE I'VE

01:25.750 --> 01:27.513
JUST BEEN TOLD THAT YOUR SAFE

01:27.520 --> 01:28.646
HOUSE WILL BE READY BY THEN.

01:28.650 --> 01:29.548
>> OH, REALLY? WHERE ARE THEY

01:29.550 --> 01:30.847
SENDING US? I HOPE IT'S

01:30.850 --> 01:31.589
SOMEPLACE WARM. I

01:31.590 --> 01:32.716
REQUESTED SOMEPLACE WITH NO

01:32.720 --> 01:34.483
SNOW. I AM NOT GONNA SHOVEL

01:34.490 --> 01:35.787
ANY MORE DRIVEWAYS.

01:35.790 --> 01:36.882
>> DR. MCNAMARA, WOULD YOU MIND

01:36.890 --> 01:38.619
EXCUSING US? YOU'RE NOT CLEARED

01:38.630 --> 01:39.858
TO HEAR ABOUT THE MORRETI'IS'

01:39.860 --> 01:42.260
FUTURE LOCATION. IT'S FOR YOUR

01:42.270 --> 01:44.158
SAFETY AS WELL AS THEIRS.

01:44.170 --> 01:47.867
>> OF COURSE.

01:47.870 --> 01:51.203
>> W-WAIT. IF HE DOESN'T KNOW

01:51.210 --> 01:52.177
WHERE WE'RE GOING, HOW IS HE

01:52.180 --> 01:53.272
GONNA GET IN TOUCH WITH US?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.475
>> OH, HE CAN'T, SWEETHEART.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.447
>> CAN HE AT LEAST GIVE US

01:56.450 --> 01:58.247
HIS ADDRESS? SO I CAN SEND HIM

01:58.250 --> 01:59.342
A POSTCARD OR SOMETHING?

01:59.350 --> 02:00.214
>> I'M AFRAID NOT, SON.

02:00.220 --> 02:00.948
>> WHAT'S THE HARM IN HIM

02:00.950 --> 02:01.917
KNOWING WHERE I LIVE? I'M

02:01.920 --> 02:02.887
CERTAINLY NOT GONNA TALK TO

02:02.890 --> 02:03.413
ANYONE.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.387
>> ANY ATTEMPT HE MAKES TO

02:04.390 --> 02:05.914
LOCATE YOU OR ANYONE FROM HIS

02:05.920 --> 02:07.558
OLD LIFE COULD COMPROMISE HIS

02:07.560 --> 02:09.187
LOCATION. YOU'LL ALL HAVE TO SAY

02:09.190 --> 02:10.851
YOUR GOOD-BYES HERE.

02:10.860 --> 02:13.249
>> FIRST YOU MESS UP MY FACE AND

02:13.260 --> 02:14.295
NOW YOU TELL ME WHO I CAN BE

02:14.300 --> 02:18.760
FRIENDS WITH? I HATE THIS!

02:18.770 --> 02:20.237
>> YOUR BEDSIDE MANNER LEAVES

02:20.240 --> 02:21.389
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.936
>> YOU'VE NEVER BEEN IN COMBAT,

02:22.940 --> 02:25.238
DR. MCNAMARA. FOLLOWING PROTOCOL

02:25.240 --> 02:27.231
SAVES MANY MORE LIVES THAN BEING

02:27.240 --> 02:28.229
SENSITIVE.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.275
>> THAT BOY IS GONNA NEED MORE

02:29.280 --> 02:30.702
THAN PROTOCOL TO SURVIVE WHAT

02:30.710 --> 02:32.575
HE'S GOING THROUGH.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.757
>> AUSTIN IS MISSING. ALL OF

02:44.760 --> 02:47.695
HIS THINGS ARE GONE, TOO.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.826
>> RELAX, NIKKI. THIS IS A

02:48.830 --> 02:49.922
GOVERNMENT COMPOUND. HE CAN'T

02:49.930 --> 02:50.669
JUST WALK OUT.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.762
>> AUSTIN AND I HAVE FOUND 5

02:51.770 --> 02:52.896
UNGUARDED EXITS TO THIS PLACE

02:52.900 --> 02:53.935
SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE. THESE ARE

02:53.940 --> 02:54.838
THE THINGS YOU DO WHEN PEOPLE

02:54.840 --> 02:56.603
ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU. I KNEW

02:56.610 --> 02:57.463
ALL OF THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR

02:57.470 --> 02:58.334
HIM. WHAT IF HE GOES HOME

02:58.340 --> 02:59.329
AND THEY SEE HIM? THEY'RE GONNA

02:59.340 --> 03:00.477
KILL HIM ON THE SPOT, OR THEY'RE

03:00.480 --> 03:02.448
GONNA USE HIM TO GET TO ME.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.406
I HAVE GOT TO FIND HIM.

03:04.410 --> 03:05.308
>> WAIT. I THINK I KNOW WHERE

03:05.310 --> 03:07.016
HE'S GOING. THIS IS MY FAULT. I

03:07.020 --> 03:08.544
GAVE HIM MY ADDRESS ON THE SLY.

03:08.550 --> 03:09.812
I FIGURED EVEN IF HE NEVER USED

03:09.820 --> 03:11.378
IT, IT MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL

03:11.390 --> 03:13.517
BETI'ER. I'M 2 HOURS FROM HERE.

03:13.520 --> 03:14.851
I'LL GO, BRING HIM BACK.

03:14.860 --> 03:16.282
>> YOU'LL TAKE ME WITH YOU.

03:16.290 --> 03:16.949
>> YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS

03:16.960 --> 03:17.949
COMPOUND. YOU'LL ONLY BE

03:17.960 --> 03:19.291
ENDANGERING YOURSELF. YOU KNOW

03:19.300 --> 03:20.824
THE RULES. YOU AGREED TO THEM.

03:20.830 --> 03:21.751
>> YOU KNEW THE RULES, TOO.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.763
THAT DIDN'T STOP YOU.

04:12.850 --> 04:14.715
>> TELL ME...WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT

04:14.720 --> 04:16.073
YOURSELF.

04:16.080 --> 04:21.655
>> I'M A MEDALIST. I WON THIS,

04:21.660 --> 04:25.380
GOOD FRIENDS GAMES. I RUN 440.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.721
ROUND THE TRACK.

04:26.730 --> 04:27.822
>> TOM'S NOT THE FASTEST, BUT

04:27.830 --> 04:29.559
HE'S GOT MORE ENDURANCE THAN

04:29.570 --> 04:32.027
ALL OF THEM.

04:32.030 --> 04:34.032
>> UH, TELL US WHAT WE CAN DO

04:34.040 --> 04:35.735
FOR YOU, TOMMY.

04:35.740 --> 04:38.800
>> I WANT LOOK LIKE MY FAMILY.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.437
>> I'M SORRY. I DON'T

04:40.440 --> 04:41.429
UNDERSTAND.

04:41.440 --> 04:43.044
>> TOMMY IS THE OLDEST OF 3,

04:43.050 --> 04:44.108
2 BOYS AND A GIRL.

04:44.110 --> 04:45.577
>> THE OTHER KIDS ARE...

04:45.580 --> 04:46.979
>> NORMAL.

04:46.980 --> 04:47.912
>> WE DON'T LIKE TO USE THAT

04:47.920 --> 04:49.012
WORD. ALL OF OUR CHILDREN

04:49.020 --> 04:50.089
ARE SPECIAL.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.842
>> I GOT DOWN SYNDROME.

04:51.850 --> 04:54.080
THIS NOT MY FAULT. I'M BORN

04:54.090 --> 04:56.820
THIS WAY. I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.652
ALL I WANT IS TO LOOK LIKE

05:00.660 --> 05:07.691
THE PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.908
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

05:10.910 --> 05:14.437
>> NOTHING. I CAN SEE WHY

05:14.440 --> 05:15.976
YOU WANT TO. YOU HAVE A VERY

05:15.980 --> 05:17.868
NICE-LOOKING FAMILY. YOU'RE

05:17.880 --> 05:18.801
LUCKY.

05:18.810 --> 05:22.610
>> WHY? YOUR FAMILY IS UGLY,

05:22.620 --> 05:24.747
DR. TROY?

05:24.750 --> 05:28.151
>> [CHUCKLES] NO, NOT EXACTLY.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.720
I--I DON'T REALLY

05:30.730 --> 05:31.981
HAVE A FAMILY.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.821
>> THAT'S SAD.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.855
>> AHEM. WHAT YOU'RE TALKING

05:35.860 --> 05:38.522
ABOUT WOULD REQUIRE 8-10

05:38.530 --> 05:39.861
SURGERIES.

05:39.870 --> 05:44.432
>> OK. MR. SHERROD AT

05:44.440 --> 05:48.137
THE BEAD STORE GIVE ME

05:48.140 --> 05:49.641
MORE TIME OFF.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.606
>> UH, TIME ISN'T AS MUCH OF A

05:51.610 --> 05:54.818
PROBLEM AS MONEY. THE COST OF

05:54.820 --> 05:56.913
THE SURGERIES IS $60,000.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.080
>> UH, WE'VE SAVED A DOLLAR HERE

05:58.090 --> 05:59.011
OR THERE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE

05:59.020 --> 06:00.419
CLOSE TO THAT AMOUNT.

06:00.420 --> 06:01.648
>> COULD WE WORK OUT SOME SORT

06:01.660 --> 06:05.619
OF A PAYMENT PLAN, A DISCOUNT?

06:05.630 --> 06:06.949
WE'VE HEARD YOU DO PRO BONO

06:06.960 --> 06:07.756
WORK SOMETIMES.

06:07.760 --> 06:08.829
>> WE'RE UNDER A NEW MANAGEMENT

06:08.830 --> 06:10.593
GROUP THAT FROWNS UPON US

06:10.600 --> 06:11.760
PERFORMING UNNECESSARY

06:11.770 --> 06:12.896
PROCEDURES FOR FREE.

06:12.900 --> 06:14.629
>> UNNECESSARY? WHAT MAKES

06:14.640 --> 06:15.629
TOMMY'S SURGERY ANY LESS

06:15.640 --> 06:17.198
NECESSARY THAN SOME BOOB JOB?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.802
>> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, BUT WE

06:18.810 --> 06:19.799
DON'T PERFORM BOOB JOBS

06:19.810 --> 06:27.819
FOR FREE EITHER. I'M SORRY. OH.

06:27.820 --> 06:28.912
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR MEDAL,

06:28.920 --> 06:29.648
TOMMY.

06:29.650 --> 06:31.709
>> THANK YOU.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.997
IT'S BROKEN.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.001
>> YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SUCH AN

06:50.010 --> 06:51.534
ASSHOLE TO THE BOLTONS.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.677
>> WELL, I LIKE TO I SAVE MY

06:52.680 --> 06:53.669
SENSITIVITY FOR PAYING

06:53.680 --> 06:55.636
CUSTOMERS. THIS BUSINESS

06:55.640 --> 06:57.039
NEEDS TO BE A BULLET TRAIN, NOT

06:57.050 --> 06:58.779
THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD.

06:58.780 --> 06:59.815
>> WELL, I'M GONNA GIVE

06:59.820 --> 07:00.946
THEM A DISCOUNT.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.144
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT, BECAUSE THIS

07:02.150 --> 07:03.082
IS NOT THE MAKE A WISH

07:03.090 --> 07:05.012
FOUNDATION. CHRISTIAN, DON'T LET

07:05.020 --> 07:06.009
YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE PATIENT

07:06.020 --> 07:08.079
CLOUD YOUR JUDGMENT. BESIDES,

07:08.090 --> 07:08.988
YOU'RE JUST SETTING HIM UP

07:08.990 --> 07:10.150
FOR A BIGGER DISAPPOINTMENT.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.697
>> HIS LIFE IS A DISAPPOINTMENT.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.553
ALL HE WANTS IS TO FEEL LIKE

07:13.560 --> 07:14.254
A PART OF HIS FAMILY.

07:14.260 --> 07:15.249
>> HE IS A PART OF HIS FAMILY.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.227
>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

07:16.230 --> 07:17.561
IT'S LIKE TO SHARE BLOOD WITH

07:17.570 --> 07:18.923
SOMEBODY AND YET FEEL LIKE

07:18.930 --> 07:19.931
YOU DON'T CONNECT?

07:19.940 --> 07:20.793
>> YOU WANNA RECONNECT WITH

07:20.800 --> 07:23.030
SOMEBODY? HOW ABOUT JULIA

07:23.040 --> 07:26.009
MCNAMARA? DE LA MER IS BLOWING

07:26.010 --> 07:27.238
UP. WE'VE GO'I'I'A MAKE THAT

07:27.240 --> 07:28.673
EXCLUSIVE DEAL WITH THEM. OUR

07:28.680 --> 07:29.942
CLIENTS SHOULD BE FILLING EVERY

ONE OF THOSE BEDS, AND JULIA

07:31.250 --> 07:32.103
SHOULD BE PAYING US FOR THE

07:32.110 --> 07:32.849
PRIVILEGE.

07:32.850 --> 07:34.977
>> DE LA MERDE IS A GLORIFIED

07:34.980 --> 07:36.789
MASSAGE PARLOR. AND ONCE

07:36.790 --> 07:37.848
EVERYBODY FINDS OUT THAT ITS

07:37.850 --> 07:40.011
PROPRIETORS ARE A DYKE, A WHORE,

07:40.020 --> 07:42.682
AND A HOUSEWIFE, THOSE 3

07:42.690 --> 07:43.987
BUSINESSWOMEN WILL BE

07:43.990 --> 07:45.651
STUCK GIVING RUB AND TUGS JUST

07:45.660 --> 07:46.797
TO KEEP THEIR CLIENT LIST UP.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.199
>> OH, THAT'S FINE. YOU HAVE

07:48.200 --> 07:50.794
YOUR PRIDE, BUT IF WE DON'T DO

07:50.800 --> 07:51.721
SOMETHING TO REGAIN OUR

07:51.730 --> 07:53.960
MARKETABILITY, QUICKLY, WELL,

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA BE

07:55.000 --> 07:55.932
GIVING OUT FREE HAND JOBS TO

07:55.940 --> 07:58.602
KEEP THE BUSINESS AFLOAT.

08:16.930 --> 08:17.828
>> DON'T EVER DO ANYTHING

08:17.830 --> 08:18.819
LIKE THAT TO ME AGAIN,

08:18.830 --> 08:20.957
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.328
>> DR. MCNAMARA?

08:29.340 --> 08:30.762
>> WHAT IS IT, AUSTIN?

08:30.770 --> 08:31.998
>> CAN I USE YOUR BATHROOM?

08:32.010 --> 08:33.978
>> [CHUCKLES] YEAH, IT'S DOWN

08:33.980 --> 08:38.770
THE HALL ON THE LEFT.

08:38.780 --> 08:39.747
>> AYE, IF SOMEBODY HAD TOLD ME

08:39.750 --> 08:40.648
IT WOULD BE THIS HARD, I WOULD

08:40.650 --> 08:41.309
HAVE STAYED AT HOME AND LET

08:41.320 --> 08:46.087
THEM KILL ME. [EXHALES]

08:46.090 --> 08:46.886
>> YOU WANT SOMETHING TO

08:46.890 --> 08:49.859
DRINK? I'D IMAGINE THE O.J. AND

08:49.860 --> 08:51.225
MILK HAVE GONE BAD SINCE I LEFI',

08:51.230 --> 08:52.925
BUT I MIGHT HAVE SOME SODA.

08:52.930 --> 08:56.661
>> I WOULD KILL FOR A COLD BEER.

09:05.210 --> 09:06.359
>> WANT A GLASS?

09:06.370 --> 09:08.235
>> NO, JUST SHOOT IT DIRECTLY

09:08.240 --> 09:10.003
INTO MY VEINS.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.683
THANK YOU...FOR THIS, FOR

09:19.690 --> 09:22.181
EVERYTHING. YOU'VE BEEN, LIKE, A

09:22.190 --> 09:23.885
GODSEND TO AUSTIN AND ME. YOU'RE

09:23.890 --> 09:27.223
LIKE OUR GUARDIAN ANGEL.

09:27.230 --> 09:33.260
>> I LIKE THE WAY YOU SEE ME.

09:33.270 --> 09:36.159
>> THIS IS A NICE HOUSE.

09:36.170 --> 09:40.379
ELEGANT, BUT STILL LIVED IN,

09:40.380 --> 09:41.335
LIKE SOMEONE SHOULD BE BAKING

09:41.340 --> 09:42.329
COOKIES IN THE KITCHEN OR

09:42.340 --> 09:44.274
SOMETHING.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.838
>> MY WIFE AND I REDID THE WHOLE

09:45.850 --> 09:47.738
THING WHEN WE MOVED IN, TOOK

09:47.750 --> 09:50.412
US A YEAR. WE RAISED 2 KIDS IN

09:50.420 --> 09:53.753
THIS HOUSE, BUT IT HASN'T FELT

09:53.760 --> 09:57.719
LIKE HOME, FEW MONTHS. IT'S JUST

09:57.730 --> 09:58.822
HAUNTED BY THE GHOSTS OF THE

09:58.830 --> 10:01.799
FAMILY THAT USED TO LIVE HERE.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.121
>> CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY. IT'S

10:04.130 --> 10:05.358
BE'I'I'ER TO BE HAUNTED BY THE

10:05.370 --> 10:06.860
GHOSTS OF GOOD MEMORIES THAN THE

10:06.870 --> 10:10.135
GHOSTS OF BAD ONES. AUSTIN, ARE

10:10.140 --> 10:17.000
YOU OK? AUSTIN.

10:25.450 --> 10:26.758
I SHOULD WAKE HIM UP.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.685
>> NO, LET HIM SLEEP.

10:30.690 --> 10:31.281
>> WE HAVE TO GET BACK.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.622
SAGAMORE'S GONNA HAVE OUR HEADS.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.899
>> SAGAMORE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW

10:41.900 --> 10:44.004
WE'RE MISSING YET. YOUR SAFE

10:44.010 --> 10:44.999
HOUSE ISN'T GONNA BE READY

10:45.010 --> 10:48.309
FOR A WEEK. YOU CAN FINISH

10:48.310 --> 10:50.847
HEALING HERE.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.772
>> WE'RE DAMAGED GOODS, SEAN.

10:52.780 --> 10:53.815
HAVING US HERE MAKES YOU A

10:53.820 --> 10:54.809
TARGET, TOO.

10:54.820 --> 10:55.912
>> TARGET TO WHO? NO ONE KNOWS

10:55.920 --> 10:58.309
WE'RE HERE. THIS PLACE NEEDS A

10:58.320 --> 11:00.982
FAMILY, EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR A

11:00.990 --> 11:05.927
WEEK. YOU'RE GONNA DISAPPEAR

11:05.930 --> 11:07.329
IN A WEEK. WE'LL NEVER SEE EACH

11:07.330 --> 11:09.821
OTHER AGAIN, JUST ANOTHER COUPLE

11:09.830 --> 11:12.196
OF GHOSTS. ALL WE'RE GONNA HAVE

11:12.200 --> 11:14.236
LEFI' IS OUR MEMORIES. LET'S

11:14.240 --> 11:16.128

Gail: $36 FOR CHICKEN?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.682
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MOM.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.125
>> I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID

11:38.130 --> 11:39.859
TO YOU AT THE POLICE STATION.

11:39.860 --> 11:43.227
I LOOKED AT YOU AND I SAW HIM,

11:43.230 --> 11:46.063
AND I--I JUST ASSUMED THAT YOU

11:46.070 --> 11:48.288
WERE ONE AND THE SAME.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.530
>> THAT'S ALL RIGHT. THE

11:50.540 --> 11:52.098
CIRCUMSTANCE WASN'T REALLY SET

11:52.110 --> 11:56.535
UP FOR A DREAM REUNION.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.077
>> SO, WHY TRACK ME DOWN NOW?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.445
THAT POLICE BUSINESS WAS WEEKS

12:00.450 --> 12:02.077
AGO. WHAT CHANGED?

12:02.080 --> 12:03.513
>> A YOUNG MAN WITH DOWN

12:03.520 --> 12:04.817
SYNDROME CAME INTO THE OFFICE

12:04.820 --> 12:05.809
THE OTHER DAY FOR A

12:05.820 --> 12:08.459
CONSULTATION, AND HE WANTED US

12:08.460 --> 12:10.257
TO MAKE HIM LOOK MORE LIKE HIS

12:10.260 --> 12:12.251
FAMILY. SOMETHING HE SAID JUST

12:12.260 --> 12:15.320
KIND OF STUCK WITH ME.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.798
HE SAID THAT IT WASN'T

12:17.800 --> 12:18.960
HIS FAULT THAT HE LOOKED THE WAY

12:18.970 --> 12:19.390
THAT HE DID,

12:19.400 --> 12:22.961
THAT IT WAS JUST HIS LOT.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.301
>> I'M--I'M SORRY, CHRISTIAN,

12:24.310 --> 12:28.474
BUT HOW DOES THAT RELATE TO ME?

12:28.480 --> 12:31.938
>> HE INSPIRED ME TO CALL YOU.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.474
HE HASN'T LET HIS CONDITION STOP

12:33.480 --> 12:34.469
HIM FROM BEING A PART OF HIS

12:34.480 --> 12:38.917
FAMILY, AND I DON'T WANNA LET

12:38.920 --> 12:40.353
HOW I CAME TO BE STOP ME FROM

12:40.360 --> 12:42.988
BEING A PART OF MY FAMILY,

12:42.990 --> 12:48.098
FROM HAVING A MOTHER.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.328
>> I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR WHAT

12:49.330 --> 12:51.821
YOUR FATHER DID TO ME.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.095
>> THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE I WANNA

12:55.100 --> 12:56.237
BE A PART OF YOUR LIFE, NOT

12:56.240 --> 13:00.131
JUST THE PERSONIFICATION OF A...

13:00.140 --> 13:02.005
BAD MEMORY.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.445
>> WHAT'S THIS?

13:08.450 --> 13:10.281
>> IT'S A MOTHER'S DAY GIFI'.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.440
IT'S ACTUALLY 40 MOTHER'S DAY

13:12.450 --> 13:14.452
GIFI'S.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.989
>> OH, YOU WANNA GIVE ME PLASTIC

13:24.000 --> 13:27.436
SURGERY? SHOULD I BE INSULTED?

13:27.440 --> 13:29.169
>> NO, NOT AT ALL. YOU'RE

13:29.170 --> 13:31.035
BEAUTIFUL, BUT EVERYBODY HAS

13:31.040 --> 13:32.029
SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED

13:32.040 --> 13:33.200
SPRUCED UP. [CHUCKLES]

13:33.210 --> 13:35.075
>> WELL, THIS IS VERY GENEROUS

13:36.880 --> 13:39.348
I HARDLY EVEN WEAR MUCH MAKEUP.

13:39.350 --> 13:43.218
THIS IS AN $11 HAIRCUT. AND--

13:43.220 --> 13:44.983
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.649
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN A

13:45.650 --> 13:46.582
PERSON GOES THROUGH A

13:46.590 --> 13:48.148
LIFE-ALTERING TRAUMA THE WAY

13:48.160 --> 13:49.957
THAT YOU DID, HORMONES

13:49.960 --> 13:51.427
ARE RELEASED THAT ACTUALLY SPEED

13:51.430 --> 13:53.421
UP THE AGING PROCESS? KIND OF

13:53.430 --> 13:54.499
LIKE WHEN SOMEBODY GOES GRAY

13:54.500 --> 13:55.649
BECAUSE THEY'RE STRESSED OR

13:55.660 --> 13:58.322
BECAUSE OF FEAR. THOSE

TINY LINES AROUND YOUR EYES OR

14:00.100 --> 14:03.103
YOUR MOUTH, THE SLIGHT DROOP IN

YOUR JAW LINE, IT'S--I'M

14:06.940 --> 14:10.979
SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.948
JUST COME IN FOR A CONSULTATION.

14:12.950 --> 14:13.974
YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION FROM

14:13.980 --> 14:16.119
THERE.

14:16.120 --> 14:16.984
>> CAN YOU REALLY GET RID OF

14:16.990 --> 14:18.582
THESE LITTLE LINES?

14:18.590 --> 14:21.081
>> IN AN HOUR.

15:38.200 --> 15:39.121
WAS ALWAYS INTRIGUED BY YOUR
