WEBVTT

00:36.917 --> 00:39.834
Captain, we have arrived

00:36.917 --> 00:39.834
at Tanuga IV.

00:39.875 --> 00:43.083
The away team has completed

00:39.875 --> 00:43.083
its survey of Dr. Apgar's work

00:43.125 --> 00:45.583
and is ready to return

00:43.125 --> 00:45.583
to the ship.

00:45.625 --> 00:46.875
Good.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.625
Oh, please... and feel free

00:52.667 --> 00:56.959
to examine the work

00:52.667 --> 00:56.959
of the other students, too.

01:01.458 --> 01:02.500
Hmm...

01:02.542 --> 01:05.208
Ensign Williams'

01:02.542 --> 01:05.208
striking style

01:05.250 --> 01:06.875
is heavily influenced

01:06.917 --> 01:09.041
by geometric

01:06.917 --> 01:09.041
constructivism.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.792
Lieutenant Wright has

01:16.500 --> 01:18.792
effectively fused

01:18.834 --> 01:21.250
the incongruities

01:18.834 --> 01:21.250
of the surrealists

01:21.291 --> 01:23.709
with the irrationality

01:21.291 --> 01:23.709
of Dadaism.

01:35.625 --> 01:36.875
Interesting.

01:36.917 --> 01:37.834
Oh.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.750
Thank you.

01:39.792 --> 01:41.917
In what way?

01:41.959 --> 01:45.750
While suggesting

01:41.959 --> 01:45.750
the free treatment of form

01:45.792 --> 01:47.250
usually attributed to fauvism

01:47.291 --> 01:52.125
this quite inappropriately

01:47.291 --> 01:52.125
attempts to juxtapose

01:52.166 --> 01:55.375
the disparate

01:52.166 --> 01:55.375
cubistic styles of

01:52.166 --> 01:55.375
Picasso and Leger.

01:55.417 --> 01:59.500
In addition, the use of color

01:55.417 --> 01:59.500
suggests a haphazard melange

01:59.542 --> 02:01.041
of clashing styles.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.792
Furthermore,

02:01.083 --> 02:02.792
the unsettling

02:01.083 --> 02:02.792
overtones

02:02.834 --> 02:04.166
of proto-Vulcan

02:02.834 --> 02:04.166
influences...

02:04.208 --> 02:06.208
Thank you... Mr. Data.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.333
You are welcome, sir.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.750
If I can be of

02:07.375 --> 02:09.750
further assistance...

02:09.792 --> 02:11.583
<i>No...</i> thank you.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.542
Welcome back,

02:35.667 --> 02:37.542
Mr. La Forge.

02:37.583 --> 02:38.917
Thank you, sir.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.792
Where's Commander Riker?

02:40.834 --> 02:42.667
He's still down

02:40.834 --> 02:42.667
on the station, sir.

02:42.709 --> 02:44.875
Dr. Apgar wanted

02:42.709 --> 02:44.875
to have a word with him.

02:44.917 --> 02:47.000
Any problems?

02:47.041 --> 02:51.250
Not with the scientific part

02:47.041 --> 02:51.250
of the mission, no, sir.

02:51.291 --> 02:53.000
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

02:53.041 --> 02:54.875
I'm ready to leave now.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.000
I'm sure Commander Riker

02:54.917 --> 02:56.000
will be able

02:56.041 --> 02:57.083
to explain

02:56.041 --> 02:57.083
everything, Captain.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.875
O'BRIEN:

02:57.125 --> 02:58.875
Stand by, Commander.

02:58.917 --> 03:01.208

03:04.709 --> 03:06.583

03:06.625 --> 03:08.208
I have a power drain.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.625
Transporter Room.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.542
Is Commander Riker aboard?

03:21.583 --> 03:25.375
O'BRIEN:

03:21.583 --> 03:25.375
Not yet, Captain. I'm having

03:21.583 --> 03:25.375
trouble clearing the signal.

03:33.333 --> 03:36.000
Transporter Room to Bridge.

03:36.041 --> 03:39.208
He's aboard.

03:40.792 --> 03:42.917
Why do you sound

03:40.792 --> 03:42.917
so surprised, Mr. O'Brien?

03:42.959 --> 03:44.834
Well, for a moment,

03:42.959 --> 03:44.834
we weren't sure

03:44.875 --> 03:46.667
you left the space

03:44.875 --> 03:46.667
station in time.

03:46.709 --> 03:48.250
In time for what?

03:48.291 --> 03:51.583
It just exploded, sir.

04:23.959 --> 04:28.125
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

04:28.166 --> 04:32.375
<i>These are the voyages</i>

04:28.166 --> 04:32.375
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.125
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

04:34.166 --> 04:38.166
<i>to explore</i>

04:34.166 --> 04:38.166

04:38.208 --> 04:42.750

04:38.208 --> 04:42.750
<i>and new civilizations...</i>

04:42.792 --> 04:47.375
<i>to boldly go</i>

04:42.792 --> 04:47.375

05:46.750 --> 05:48.667
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

05:48.709 --> 05:50.417
<i>Commander Riker has informed me</i>

05:50.458 --> 05:53.333
<i>that Dr. Apgar was the only one</i>

05:50.458 --> 05:53.333
<i>aboard the space station</i>

05:53.375 --> 05:55.166
<i>when it exploded.</i>

05:55.208 --> 05:59.542
<i>We remain in orbit</i>

05:55.208 --> 05:59.542
<i>investigating the accident.</i>

05:59.583 --> 06:01.792
I've gone through

05:59.583 --> 06:01.792
the whole system, Captain.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.166
I can't find any malfunction

06:01.834 --> 06:05.166
in the transporter

06:05.208 --> 06:07.667
or nothing that would cause

06:05.208 --> 06:07.667
an explosion like that.

06:07.709 --> 06:09.875
Why was there

06:07.709 --> 06:09.875
a power drain

06:07.709 --> 06:09.875
before transport?

06:09.917 --> 06:11.041
I don't know, sir.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.834
I shall want an

06:11.083 --> 06:12.834
answer to that.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.542
I'm sure the

06:12.875 --> 06:14.542
Tanugans will, too.

06:14.583 --> 06:15.834
Yes, sir.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.583
Captain, the radiation

06:15.875 --> 06:17.583
and debris

06:17.625 --> 06:20.709
are consistent with an overload

06:17.625 --> 06:20.709
of the station's reactor core.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.834
Were there

06:20.750 --> 06:22.834
any indications

06:22.875 --> 06:24.250
of reactor

06:22.875 --> 06:24.250
core problems

06:24.291 --> 06:25.500
while you were

06:24.291 --> 06:25.500
on the station?

06:25.542 --> 06:26.458
No, sir.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.375
Number One?

06:30.417 --> 06:32.917
Mr. La Forge indicated

06:32.959 --> 06:35.583
that this was not

06:32.959 --> 06:35.583
an entirely routine mission.

06:35.625 --> 06:36.959
It's a long story, sir

06:37.041 --> 06:39.750
but I'm sure it doesn't have

06:37.041 --> 06:39.750
anything to do

06:39.792 --> 06:40.709
with this accident.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.500
(<i> communications beep</i> )

06:42.542 --> 06:45.583
Captain, Chief Investigator Krag

06:42.542 --> 06:45.583
of the Tanugan security force

06:45.625 --> 06:47.458
requests permission

06:45.625 --> 06:47.458
to beam aboard.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.125
Granted. Will you

06:47.500 --> 06:50.125
escort him to the

06:47.500 --> 06:50.125
Bridge, Mr. Worf?

06:50.166 --> 06:53.375
WORF:

06:50.166 --> 06:53.375
Aye, sir.

06:53.417 --> 06:57.125
Perhaps you had better tell me

06:53.417 --> 06:57.125
as much as possible

06:57.166 --> 07:00.166
prior to his arrival,

06:57.166 --> 07:00.166
Number One.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.375
(<i> sighing</i> )

07:12.750 --> 07:15.583
I'm Lieutenant Worf,

07:12.750 --> 07:15.583
head of ship's security.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.417
I will take you to the Captain.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.500
Chief Investigator,

07:26.542 --> 07:28.834
welcome to

07:26.542 --> 07:28.834
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

07:28.875 --> 07:30.458
I'm Captain Picard.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.458
This is my

07:30.500 --> 07:32.458
First Officer

07:32.500 --> 07:34.375
Commander

07:32.500 --> 07:34.375
William Riker.

07:34.417 --> 07:38.917
Commander Riker, I am here

07:34.417 --> 07:38.917
to take you into custody.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.041
Custody? On what charge?

07:41.083 --> 07:42.875
Suspicion of murder.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.000
Murder? Now, wait a minute.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.000
You can't come on...

07:45.041 --> 07:46.458
Chief Investigator...

07:46.500 --> 07:48.667
we are perfectly willing

07:46.500 --> 07:48.667
to cooperate with you...

07:48.709 --> 07:49.917
Then release the prisoner

07:49.959 --> 07:52.000
for transportation

07:49.959 --> 07:52.000
to the planet.

07:55.333 --> 07:58.125
Let's continue this

07:55.333 --> 07:58.125
discussion in private.

08:00.125 --> 08:04.125
Number One, you

08:00.125 --> 08:04.125
have the Bridge.

08:25.083 --> 08:28.333
Just what is the evidence

08:25.083 --> 08:28.333
against my officer?

08:28.375 --> 08:29.917
Two witnesses have come forward

08:29.959 --> 08:33.375
to describe Commander Riker's

08:29.959 --> 08:33.375
threats against Dr. Apgar.

08:33.417 --> 08:34.500
Threats?

08:34.542 --> 08:35.667
I'm aware there was

08:35.709 --> 08:37.500
a private conversation

08:35.709 --> 08:37.500
between them.

08:37.542 --> 08:40.250
Apparently, it was much more

08:37.542 --> 08:40.250
than just a private conversation

08:40.291 --> 08:43.792
but he will be given a chance

08:40.291 --> 08:43.792
to prove his innocence.

08:43.834 --> 08:47.291
Investigator, in our system

08:43.834 --> 08:47.291
of jurisprudence,

08:47.333 --> 08:50.375
a man is innocent

08:47.333 --> 08:50.375
until proved guilty.

08:50.417 --> 08:53.709
In ours, he is guilty

08:50.417 --> 08:53.709
until he is proved innocent,

08:53.750 --> 08:56.166
and you are under

08:53.750 --> 08:56.166
our jurisdiction.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.583
If I understand Federation

08:56.208 --> 08:59.583
regulations on this matter,

08:59.625 --> 09:02.125
and I just happened

08:59.625 --> 09:02.125
to look them up...

09:02.166 --> 09:04.750
I am aware of Federation

09:02.166 --> 09:04.750
regulations, sir,

09:04.792 --> 09:07.083
and if you investigate

09:04.792 --> 09:07.083
them further

09:07.125 --> 09:09.208
you will find

09:07.125 --> 09:09.208
the Captain decides

09:09.250 --> 09:11.083
if extradition

09:09.250 --> 09:11.083
is warranted.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.709
Are you saying it is not?

09:12.750 --> 09:16.000
I am saying

09:12.750 --> 09:16.000
if there is sufficient cause

09:16.041 --> 09:17.417
to warrant a trial,

09:17.458 --> 09:21.000
I will release my officer

09:17.458 --> 09:21.000
into your custody.

09:21.041 --> 09:24.834
Would you say that you are close

09:21.041 --> 09:24.834
to your First Officer, Captain?

09:24.875 --> 09:27.542
That question

09:24.875 --> 09:27.542
is irrelevant here.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.834
Really, Captain,

09:27.583 --> 09:29.834
you cannot believe that.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.875
How can I expect

09:29.875 --> 09:32.875
a fair and impartial decision?

09:32.917 --> 09:35.834
I must protect the

09:32.917 --> 09:35.834
rights of my officer.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.208
I can appreciate that,

09:37.250 --> 09:41.834
but you will do it

09:37.250 --> 09:41.834
on the planet, not here.

09:41.875 --> 09:45.500
After all, what if you

09:41.875 --> 09:45.500
were suddenly to decide

09:45.542 --> 09:47.500
to leave this star system?

09:47.542 --> 09:50.875
You have my word

09:47.542 --> 09:50.875
as a Starfleet officer

09:50.917 --> 09:52.291
that I will not.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.834
Unacceptable.

09:55.875 --> 10:00.000
Captain, you will turn him over

09:55.875 --> 10:00.000
to me for interrogation now.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.166
Interrogate him here.

10:04.208 --> 10:08.834
We must re-create step by step,

10:04.208 --> 10:08.834
moment by moment,

10:08.875 --> 10:10.417
all the events

10:10.458 --> 10:12.125
leading to the explosion.

10:12.166 --> 10:14.583
We will require access

10:12.166 --> 10:14.583
to all the witnesses

10:14.625 --> 10:18.375
as well as the data

10:14.625 --> 10:18.375
from the lab's ground computers.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.750
It would be impossible

10:18.417 --> 10:21.750
to accomplish here.

10:21.792 --> 10:23.375
Perhaps not.

10:23.417 --> 10:24.709
Mr. Data, will you report

10:24.750 --> 10:25.875
to my ready room?

10:25.917 --> 10:26.959
DATA: Aye, sir.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
We may be able to assist you

10:29.041 --> 10:31.291
in re-creating these events.

10:33.291 --> 10:37.166
Commander Data, this is

10:33.291 --> 10:37.166
Chief Inspector Krag.

10:37.208 --> 10:39.458
Commander, by

10:37.208 --> 10:39.458
taking testimony

10:39.500 --> 10:40.959
from the away team

10:41.000 --> 10:43.875
and from witnesses provided

10:41.000 --> 10:43.875
by the Investigator,

10:43.917 --> 10:46.417
would it be possible

10:43.917 --> 10:46.417
to program the holodeck

10:46.458 --> 10:49.792
to re-create what happened

10:46.458 --> 10:49.792
on the science station?

10:49.834 --> 10:52.875
It would require construction

10:49.834 --> 10:52.875
and design specifications

10:52.917 --> 10:55.041
full orthographic

10:52.917 --> 10:55.041
representations

10:55.083 --> 10:56.792
of the Krieger equipment

10:56.834 --> 10:58.625
as well as visual

10:56.834 --> 10:58.625
representations

10:58.667 --> 11:01.083
and voice analyses

10:58.667 --> 11:01.083
of the persons involved,

11:01.125 --> 11:04.250
but it is possible.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.458
Very well.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.291
Arrangements will be

11:07.500 --> 11:10.291
made to provide you

11:10.333 --> 11:12.458
with all available

11:10.333 --> 11:12.458
information.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.458
I shall return shortly

11:12.500 --> 11:15.458
with our witnesses.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.917
Commander, will you escort

11:15.500 --> 11:18.917
Investigator Krag

11:18.959 --> 11:20.834
to Transporter Room Three?

11:35.166 --> 11:37.208
Ensign Crusher,

11:35.166 --> 11:37.208
Mr. La Forge...

11:37.250 --> 11:40.125
we are going

11:37.250 --> 11:40.125
to re-create the

11:37.250 --> 11:40.125
research station

11:40.166 --> 11:41.750
here on the holodeck.

11:41.792 --> 11:44.250
I want you to work

11:41.792 --> 11:44.250
with Commander Data

11:41.792 --> 11:44.250
on the preparations.

11:44.291 --> 11:48.125
In addition,

11:44.291 --> 11:48.125
Commander La Forge

11:44.291 --> 11:48.125
and Commander Riker,

11:48.166 --> 11:49.542
I want you to

11:48.166 --> 11:49.542
give the computer

11:49.583 --> 11:52.208
detailed depositions

11:49.583 --> 11:52.208
of everything you saw,

11:52.250 --> 11:54.625
everything you heard

11:52.250 --> 11:54.625
while you were on board.

11:54.667 --> 12:00.125
Counselor, I want

11:54.667 --> 12:00.125
you to assist me

11:54.667 --> 12:00.125
during this inquiry.

12:03.792 --> 12:07.250
My decision about

12:03.792 --> 12:07.250
the extradition will be based

12:07.291 --> 12:12.041
on the evidence presented

12:07.291 --> 12:12.041
during these re-creations.

12:14.291 --> 12:15.709
Captain...

12:17.792 --> 12:19.792
May I have a word with you?

12:19.834 --> 12:22.166
Under the circumstances,

12:19.834 --> 12:22.166
Number One,

12:22.208 --> 12:24.208
I think that would be

12:22.208 --> 12:24.208
inappropriate.

12:36.500 --> 12:41.583
DATA:

12:36.500 --> 12:41.583
<i>Second Officer's Log,</i>

12:36.500 --> 12:41.583

12:58.542 --> 13:02.041
<i>margin of error.</i>

13:09.625 --> 13:11.625
(<i> door begins closing</i> )

13:27.875 --> 13:29.792
Is there anything

13:27.875 --> 13:29.792
you'd like to say

13:29.834 --> 13:31.500
before we begin,

13:29.834 --> 13:31.500
Number One?

13:31.542 --> 13:33.083
Just this.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.166
I'm not a murderer.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.625
I went to the

13:35.208 --> 13:36.625
Tanugan lab

13:36.667 --> 13:39.083
as an official

13:36.667 --> 13:39.083
representative

13:36.667 --> 13:39.083
of Starfleet.

13:39.125 --> 13:40.792
I acted accordingly.

13:40.834 --> 13:44.000
I was there to evaluate

13:40.834 --> 13:44.000
Dr. Apgar's progress

13:44.041 --> 13:45.333
in the development

13:45.375 --> 13:47.291
of a Krieger-wave

13:45.375 --> 13:47.291
converter.

13:47.333 --> 13:50.208
That's all I was

13:47.333 --> 13:50.208
interested in.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.417
Computer...

13:51.458 --> 13:52.834
(<i> beeping</i> )

13:52.875 --> 13:54.458
...load deposition program

13:54.500 --> 13:56.083
Riker One.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.500
Run the simulation.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.250
Dr. Apgar?

14:07.291 --> 14:08.792
I'm Commander

14:07.291 --> 14:08.792
William Riker.

14:08.834 --> 14:10.917
Lieutenant Commander

14:08.834 --> 14:10.917
Geordi La Forge.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.625
My assistant, Tayna.

14:12.667 --> 14:15.667
Well, let's get on

14:12.667 --> 14:15.667
with it, shall we?

14:15.709 --> 14:17.917
Let's not be in

14:15.709 --> 14:17.917
such a hurry, dear.

14:17.959 --> 14:19.000
Perhaps our guest

14:19.041 --> 14:21.500
would care for

14:19.041 --> 14:21.500
some refreshments?

14:21.542 --> 14:23.375
My wife, Manua.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.166
RIKER:

14:23.417 --> 14:25.166
A pleasure to meet you,

14:23.417 --> 14:25.166
Mrs. Apgar.

14:25.208 --> 14:27.917
If you're prepared to start,

14:25.208 --> 14:27.917
so are we.

14:27.959 --> 14:30.083
Of course,

14:27.959 --> 14:30.083
I'm prepared.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.750
All right. Why

14:30.125 --> 14:31.750
don't you give me

14:31.792 --> 14:33.500
an overview of

14:31.792 --> 14:33.500
your research

14:33.542 --> 14:35.208
while Mr. La Forge

14:33.542 --> 14:35.208
and your assistant

14:35.250 --> 14:36.333
take a look at the

14:35.250 --> 14:36.333
experimental data.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.625
Fine, whatever.

14:38.667 --> 14:40.959
I must say, Commander, I

14:38.667 --> 14:40.959
resent this early arrival.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.500
Starfleet will get

14:41.000 --> 14:42.500
its converter.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.583
I've had a few

14:42.542 --> 14:44.583
setbacks, that's all.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.041
We're not here to

14:44.625 --> 14:47.041
pressure you, Doctor.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.875
We just want an update

14:47.083 --> 14:48.875
on your progress.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.166
Tayna, show the

14:48.917 --> 14:51.166
Commander's assistant

14:51.208 --> 14:53.750
whatever he wants to

14:51.208 --> 14:53.750
see. Give him full

14:51.208 --> 14:53.750
access to our records.

14:53.792 --> 14:55.000
TAYNA:

14:53.792 --> 14:55.000
Yes, Doctor.

14:55.041 --> 14:56.458
If you'll

14:55.041 --> 14:56.458
come with me.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.333
Our lambda

14:56.500 --> 14:58.333
field generator

14:58.375 --> 15:00.000
is on the planet

14:58.375 --> 15:00.000
since it requires

15:00.041 --> 15:01.709
a minimum

15:00.041 --> 15:01.709
of 5,000 kilometers

15:01.750 --> 15:03.250
for the field

15:01.750 --> 15:03.250
to collimate.

15:03.291 --> 15:04.959
Really, darling,

15:03.291 --> 15:04.959
you're being rude.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.625
After all,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.625
Commander Riker is willing

15:06.667 --> 15:08.625
to sit through all your prattle

15:06.667 --> 15:08.625
about Krieger waves.

15:08.667 --> 15:10.500
Let's have a drink, Commander,

15:10.542 --> 15:13.083
and we'll hear

15:10.542 --> 15:13.083
all about Krieger waves.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.417
To your success, Doctor.

15:25.458 --> 15:26.875
Mm-hmm.

15:26.917 --> 15:29.542
And the rewards

15:26.917 --> 15:29.542
that come with it.

15:31.125 --> 15:33.041
Riker, what is Starfleet

15:31.125 --> 15:33.041
doing here anyway?

15:33.083 --> 15:35.750
My delivery wasn't scheduled

15:33.083 --> 15:35.750
for another three months.

15:35.792 --> 15:38.125
Well, we were in this sector

15:35.792 --> 15:38.125
on another mission,

15:38.166 --> 15:40.500
and since you had already

15:38.166 --> 15:40.500
contacted Starfleet

15:40.542 --> 15:41.959
about additional dicosilium,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.834
it seemed like

15:42.000 --> 15:43.834
a good opportunity.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.208
How interesting.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.583
Tell us about

15:45.250 --> 15:47.583
this other mission.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.375
It was just a study

15:47.625 --> 15:49.375
of a proto-star cloud.

15:49.417 --> 15:51.583
The<i> Enterprise</i>

15:49.417 --> 15:51.583
will be back tomorrow.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.000
The<i> Enterprise</i>

15:51.625 --> 15:54.000
just left you here?

15:54.041 --> 15:55.667
We didn't want

15:54.041 --> 15:55.667
to inconvenience you.

15:55.709 --> 15:57.625
We've made arrangements

15:55.709 --> 15:57.625
for quarters on the planet.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.875
Oh, I won't hear

15:57.667 --> 15:59.875
of such a thing.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.792
Commander, I insist you

15:59.917 --> 16:02.792
and Mr. La Forge stay with us.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.208
I hardly think...

16:04.250 --> 16:06.250
I know that you would prefer

16:04.250 --> 16:06.250
to be left alone

16:06.291 --> 16:08.709
with your very

16:06.291 --> 16:08.709
important work

16:08.750 --> 16:11.458
but I, for one,

16:08.750 --> 16:11.458
am glad for the company.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.959
Good.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.458
I must apologize

16:18.500 --> 16:20.542
for my husband's lack

16:18.500 --> 16:20.542
of social graces.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.250
He may be one

16:22.291 --> 16:24.750
of the great scientific minds

16:22.291 --> 16:24.750
in the galaxy, but...

16:24.792 --> 16:27.542
he does come up a bit short

16:24.792 --> 16:27.542
in other areas.

16:31.542 --> 16:32.625
KRAG:

16:31.542 --> 16:32.625
Wait a moment.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.875
Stop.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.667
Computer,

16:34.917 --> 16:36.667
freeze program.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.917
KRAG:

16:36.709 --> 16:38.917
Then it's your testimony

16:38.959 --> 16:40.500
that it was

16:38.959 --> 16:40.500
Mrs. Apgar's idea

16:40.542 --> 16:43.083
for you to spend the night

16:40.542 --> 16:43.083
aboard the space station?

16:43.125 --> 16:45.959
It's my testimony

16:43.125 --> 16:45.959
and it's the truth.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.959
Resume program.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.000
Our guest quarters

16:54.792 --> 16:57.000
aren't luxurious,

16:57.041 --> 16:59.709
but I've tried

16:57.041 --> 16:59.709
to make this room

16:57.041 --> 16:59.709
warm and inviting.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.500
I'll be very

16:59.750 --> 17:01.500
comfortable, thank you.

17:01.542 --> 17:03.792
Good night.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.375
The environmental

17:03.834 --> 17:06.375
controls are over here.

17:06.417 --> 17:08.083
I'm sure I'll find

17:06.417 --> 17:08.083
everything I need.

17:08.125 --> 17:11.959
And the door shuts

17:08.125 --> 17:11.959
by touching this panel.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.625
Mrs. Apgar...

17:16.667 --> 17:17.667
This is my sanctuary.

17:17.709 --> 17:19.417
Privacy is very important

17:19.458 --> 17:22.166
on a small station.

17:22.208 --> 17:27.291
I'm left alone here,

17:22.208 --> 17:27.291
often for hours.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.834
It's late.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.458
I am tired.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.291
Are you still tired,

17:32.000 --> 17:34.291
Commander?

17:34.333 --> 17:36.542
RIKER:

17:34.333 --> 17:36.542
Ma'am, excuse me.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.917
I really think

17:36.583 --> 17:37.917
that you ought to leave.

17:40.083 --> 17:41.792
I knew I'd find you

17:40.083 --> 17:41.792
with him.

17:41.834 --> 17:45.166
Did you think I didn't notice

17:41.834 --> 17:45.166
how you looked at him?

17:45.208 --> 17:47.375
I'm not the fool

17:45.208 --> 17:47.375
you take me for.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.625
RIKER:

17:47.417 --> 17:48.625
Doctor!

17:48.667 --> 17:50.959
(<i> groaning</i> )

17:51.000 --> 17:52.291
Doctor, believe me.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.291
This has been

17:52.333 --> 17:54.291
a terrible mistake.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.333
You won't get away with this.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.333
I'll see to it.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.208
I swear I

17:57.375 --> 17:59.208
will, Riker.

18:04.750 --> 18:05.917
Freeze program.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.542
I didn't

18:05.959 --> 18:07.542
see Dr. Apgar

18:07.583 --> 18:09.375
until the

18:07.583 --> 18:09.375
following morning

18:09.417 --> 18:11.333
when he asked

18:09.417 --> 18:11.333
to see me alone.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.542
Commander La Forge

18:11.375 --> 18:14.542
returned to the

18:11.375 --> 18:14.542
<i>Enterprise.</i>

18:14.583 --> 18:16.125
Resume program.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.625
I suppose if I make

18:17.667 --> 18:20.625
a formal complaint,

18:20.667 --> 18:22.750
your report on my work

18:20.667 --> 18:22.750
won't be very good.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.667
Doctor, this is going to have

18:22.792 --> 18:24.667
no impact on my report.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.959
It was a misunderstanding

18:24.709 --> 18:26.959
of the worst kind.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.333
We could straighten

18:27.000 --> 18:29.333
the entire thing out

18:29.375 --> 18:31.709
if you would ask

18:29.375 --> 18:31.709
Mrs. Apgar to join us.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.041
My wife and

18:31.750 --> 18:33.041
my assistant

18:33.083 --> 18:36.291
have transported

18:33.083 --> 18:36.291
down to the planet.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.750
What are you going

18:36.333 --> 18:37.750
to put in your

18:36.333 --> 18:37.750
report, Riker?

18:37.792 --> 18:40.166
That there is

18:37.792 --> 18:40.166
no justification

18:40.208 --> 18:41.667
for all the

18:40.208 --> 18:41.667
extra dicosilium

18:40.208 --> 18:41.667
I've requested?

18:41.709 --> 18:44.792
That is why they sent

18:41.709 --> 18:44.792
you early, isn't it?

18:44.834 --> 18:46.583
Doctor, I...

18:46.625 --> 18:47.917
NEL:

18:46.625 --> 18:47.917
I can explain

18:46.625 --> 18:47.917
why I needed it.

18:47.959 --> 18:49.625
They have no idea

18:47.959 --> 18:49.625
what my problems are.

18:49.667 --> 18:51.083
There are

18:49.667 --> 18:51.083
explanations for...

18:51.125 --> 18:53.208
I don't need

18:51.125 --> 18:53.208
explanations.

18:53.250 --> 18:57.625
Then we have nothing further

18:53.250 --> 18:57.625
to say to each other.

18:59.542 --> 19:02.250
I'll tell my Captain

18:59.542 --> 19:02.250
to expect your grievance.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.208
Do that.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.041
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:09.083 --> 19:11.250
I'm ready to leave now.

19:11.291 --> 19:14.583
O'BRIEN:

19:11.291 --> 19:14.583
Stand by, Commander.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.041
Engaging transport.

19:17.083 --> 19:19.041
Freeze program.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.417
Then I returned

19:19.083 --> 19:21.417
to the<i> Enterprise.</i>

19:21.458 --> 19:24.208
And you have nothing further

19:21.458 --> 19:24.208
to add, Commander?

19:24.250 --> 19:26.417
Nothing about firing a phaser?

19:26.458 --> 19:30.000
I never fired a phaser

19:26.458 --> 19:30.000
on the science station.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.000
Well, that's odd... very odd.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.208
Captain Picard, is it not true

19:36.250 --> 19:37.834
that your sensors

19:36.250 --> 19:37.834
detected an energy drain

19:37.875 --> 19:41.291
just as Commander Riker

19:37.875 --> 19:41.291
began transport?

19:41.333 --> 19:42.625
That's correct.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.583
KRAG:

19:42.667 --> 19:44.583
Have you been able

19:42.667 --> 19:44.583
to explain it?

19:44.625 --> 19:46.083
PICARD:

19:44.625 --> 19:46.083
Not to my knowledge.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.750
We have.

19:51.625 --> 19:54.542
Our readings are

19:51.625 --> 19:54.542
quite clear about it.

19:54.583 --> 19:57.166
Information retrieved

19:54.583 --> 19:57.166
from the lab's ground computers

19:57.208 --> 20:00.625
indicate that a focused

19:57.208 --> 20:00.625
energy pulse was fired

20:00.667 --> 20:03.750
just as Commander Riker

20:00.667 --> 20:03.750
began transport.

20:03.792 --> 20:06.834
Furthermore, by analyzing

20:03.792 --> 20:06.834
the angle and trajectory,

20:06.875 --> 20:09.792
we have determined that

20:06.875 --> 20:09.792
it came from the very spot

20:09.834 --> 20:12.166
Commander Riker was standing.

20:17.208 --> 20:22.125
So then, will you allow me

20:17.208 --> 20:22.125
to show you my re-creation

20:22.166 --> 20:25.125
of the end of this story?

20:25.166 --> 20:27.834
A speculation,

20:25.166 --> 20:27.834
if you will.

20:27.875 --> 20:30.125
Computer...

20:30.166 --> 20:32.959
run hypothetical Krag one.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.875
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

20:38.917 --> 20:40.625
I'm ready to leave now.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.333
O'BRIEN:

20:40.667 --> 20:42.333
Stand by, Commander.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.750
Engaging transport.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.875
KRAG:

20:45.750 --> 20:47.875
Freeze program.

20:47.917 --> 20:53.000
Three seconds later,

20:47.917 --> 20:53.000
the space station exploded.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.291
LA FORGE:

21:07.834 --> 21:09.291
The Tanugans are right.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.125
Something<i> was</i> fired

21:09.333 --> 21:11.125
at the reactor core

21:11.166 --> 21:12.250
just before transport.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.667
The energy signature

21:13.709 --> 21:15.834
would seem to indicate

21:13.709 --> 21:15.834
a phaser-like blast.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.667
Well, it<i> wasn't</i>

21:15.875 --> 21:17.667
the Commander's phaser.

21:17.709 --> 21:18.709
It couldn't have been.

21:18.750 --> 21:20.125
There's another answer.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.166
We're just not seeing it.

21:22.208 --> 21:23.667
Was there anything

21:22.208 --> 21:23.667
else in the lab

21:23.709 --> 21:26.291
capable of creating this

21:23.709 --> 21:26.291
kind of energy discharge?

21:26.333 --> 21:27.583
Not that I saw.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.208
Besides, how do you

21:27.625 --> 21:29.208
account for the fact

21:29.250 --> 21:31.625
that it came from

21:29.250 --> 21:31.625
Commander Riker's

21:29.250 --> 21:31.625
exact position?

21:31.667 --> 21:33.000
Damn it, I should've

21:31.667 --> 21:33.000
stayed with him.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.083
(<i> beeping</i> )

21:34.125 --> 21:35.625
Commander.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.500
Sensors indicate

21:35.667 --> 21:37.500
a radiation burst

21:37.542 --> 21:39.709
on deck 39

21:37.542 --> 21:39.709
outside cargo bay 12.

21:39.750 --> 21:41.083
Source?

21:41.125 --> 21:42.333
Unknown, sir.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.834
Computer, identify

21:42.375 --> 21:44.834
type of radiation.

21:44.875 --> 21:49.166
Emission is not consistent

21:44.875 --> 21:49.166
with any known radiation.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.291
It is subsiding, sir.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.000
WESLEY:

21:53.125 --> 21:56.000
What kind of radiation

21:53.125 --> 21:56.000
could do this?

21:58.000 --> 21:59.750
Make any sense to you?

21:59.792 --> 22:01.625
I don't recognize it.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.750
Not even the main deflector

22:01.667 --> 22:04.750
puts out that kind of spillage.

22:04.792 --> 22:06.250
Where would it

22:04.792 --> 22:06.250
be coming from?

22:06.291 --> 22:08.458
I don't know, Wes,

22:06.291 --> 22:08.458
but whatever it is

22:08.500 --> 22:11.583
it's capable of putting

22:08.500 --> 22:11.583
a hole in solid duranium.

22:28.917 --> 22:30.750
In a sense,

22:30.792 --> 22:32.917
we have already

22:30.792 --> 22:32.917
met Mrs. Apgar,

22:32.959 --> 22:35.500
so we shall dispense

22:32.959 --> 22:35.500
with introductions.

22:35.542 --> 22:37.375
PICARD:

22:35.542 --> 22:37.375
Mrs. Apgar,

22:37.417 --> 22:39.500
you understand the

22:37.417 --> 22:39.500
purpose of this hearing?

22:39.542 --> 22:42.041
TROI:

22:39.542 --> 22:42.041
We understand

22:42.083 --> 22:43.834
how difficult

22:42.083 --> 22:43.834
this will be for you.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.333
If you need a recess,

22:46.375 --> 22:47.750
please don't

22:46.375 --> 22:47.750
hesitate to ask.

22:47.792 --> 22:49.083
PICARD:

22:47.792 --> 22:49.083
Would you like

22:49.125 --> 22:51.208
to make a statement

22:49.125 --> 22:51.208
before we begin?

22:51.250 --> 22:52.917
No.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.417
I just know he did it.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.417
He killed my husband.

22:59.625 --> 23:01.125
Computer,

23:01.166 --> 23:04.083
load Manua

23:01.166 --> 23:04.083
Simulation One.

23:06.166 --> 23:07.792
Run program.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.875
If you greet them

23:07.834 --> 23:09.875
with such a long face

23:09.917 --> 23:11.208
they're going to assume

23:11.250 --> 23:13.583
something<i> is</i> wrong

23:11.250 --> 23:13.583
with the experiment.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.667
I just need time,

23:13.625 --> 23:15.667
a little more time.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.750
I'm certain they'll give you

23:15.709 --> 23:17.750
all the time you need

23:17.792 --> 23:20.792
if you just show

23:17.792 --> 23:20.792
a little charm.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.667
You do that so much better

23:22.709 --> 23:25.000
than I do.

23:27.041 --> 23:31.542
Manua, someday I'll be able

23:27.041 --> 23:31.542
to reward you

23:31.583 --> 23:33.208
for all

23:31.583 --> 23:33.208
your patience.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.333
I'll get you everything

23:33.250 --> 23:35.333
you ever dreamed of.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.709
I have all the reward I need.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.291
Now go on.

23:39.333 --> 23:41.875
I'll be right in.

23:43.834 --> 23:45.667
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

23:45.709 --> 23:47.000
RIKER:

23:45.709 --> 23:47.000
Dr. Apgar?

23:47.041 --> 23:49.917
I'm Commander

23:47.041 --> 23:49.917
William Riker.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.542
Lieutenant Commander

23:49.959 --> 23:51.542
Geordi La Forge.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.458
My assistant, Tayna.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.291
Well, let's get on

23:53.500 --> 23:56.291
with it, shall we?

23:56.333 --> 23:57.917
Don't be in such a hurry, dear.

23:57.959 --> 24:00.333
Perhaps our guests would

23:57.959 --> 24:00.333
like some refreshment?

24:00.375 --> 24:02.583
My wife, Manua.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.709
A pleasure

24:02.625 --> 24:04.709
to meet you, Manua.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.000
NEL:

24:04.750 --> 24:06.000
I'm anxious

24:04.750 --> 24:06.000
to get started.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.542
If you wish.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.417
I must say, I resent your

24:07.583 --> 24:09.417
early arrival, Commander.

24:09.458 --> 24:10.709
I have much work to do.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.542
Doctor, I'll

24:10.750 --> 24:12.542
do everything

24:10.750 --> 24:12.542
in my power

24:12.583 --> 24:15.291
to make this as painless

24:12.583 --> 24:15.291
as possible for both of us.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.458
Do you assist

24:15.333 --> 24:17.458
your husband

24:15.333 --> 24:17.458
in his work?

24:17.500 --> 24:19.583
Oh, dear, no,

24:17.500 --> 24:19.583
I'm no scientist.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.583
No, neither am I.

24:21.625 --> 24:24.667
But I find this all fascinating,

24:21.625 --> 24:24.667
don't you?

24:24.709 --> 24:27.333
Mr. La Forge, why

24:24.709 --> 24:27.333
don't you take a look

24:27.375 --> 24:29.709
at the Doctor's

24:27.375 --> 24:29.709
experimental data.

24:29.750 --> 24:32.083
Later you can

24:29.750 --> 24:32.083
give me an overview.

24:32.125 --> 24:33.458
Fine, whatever.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.375
Starfleet will get its

24:33.500 --> 24:35.375
Krieger-wave converter.

24:35.417 --> 24:36.583
These things take time.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.333
I've had a few setbacks,

24:36.625 --> 24:38.333
that's all.

24:38.375 --> 24:40.834
RIKER:

24:38.375 --> 24:40.834
Doctor, I'm not trying to put

24:38.375 --> 24:40.834
any pressure on you.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.750
I'm sure my report will

24:40.875 --> 24:43.750
only underscore the need

24:43.792 --> 24:46.250
for continued support

24:43.792 --> 24:46.250
of your research.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.834
Mm-hmm.

24:47.875 --> 24:49.375
Tayna,

24:49.417 --> 24:51.000
I'll call up

24:49.417 --> 24:51.000
the records.

24:51.041 --> 24:53.083
Show the Commander's

24:51.041 --> 24:53.083
assistant whatever

24:51.041 --> 24:53.083
he wants to see.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.291
Yes, Doctor. If

24:53.125 --> 24:55.291
you'll come with me.

24:55.333 --> 24:57.750
Our field generator

24:55.333 --> 24:57.750
is on the planet

24:57.792 --> 25:00.917
since it requires a minimum

24:57.792 --> 25:00.917
of 5,000 kilometers

25:00.959 --> 25:02.208
for the field

25:00.959 --> 25:02.208
to collimate.

25:03.917 --> 25:05.750
Darling, let Tayna

25:03.917 --> 25:05.750
take care of that.

25:05.792 --> 25:07.250
I'm sure

25:05.792 --> 25:07.250
Commander Riker

25:07.291 --> 25:09.625
wants to hear how

25:07.291 --> 25:09.625
close you are to

25:07.291 --> 25:09.625
a breakthrough.

25:09.667 --> 25:10.959
I'll pour the two

25:09.667 --> 25:10.959
of you a drink

25:11.000 --> 25:13.041
and you can talk all

25:11.000 --> 25:13.041
about Krieger waves.

25:21.875 --> 25:24.834
Commander.

25:24.875 --> 25:26.458
To success.

25:26.500 --> 25:27.959
Success.

25:29.792 --> 25:34.625
Well, in a way, I suppose

25:29.792 --> 25:34.625
it's good that you're early.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.125
Manua's right.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.458
It gives me a

25:36.166 --> 25:37.458
chance to show you

25:37.500 --> 25:39.375
the progress

25:37.500 --> 25:39.375
we've been making.

25:39.417 --> 25:40.792
I would appreciate it

25:40.834 --> 25:42.583
if Commander La Forge and I

25:40.834 --> 25:42.583
could stay here

25:42.625 --> 25:44.375
until the<i> Enterprise</i> returns.

25:46.208 --> 25:47.917
It's a little inconvenient.

25:47.959 --> 25:51.542
It would help

25:47.959 --> 25:51.542
to accelerate the process.

25:54.625 --> 25:58.583
Well, if you wish, Commander.

25:58.625 --> 26:01.166
Now, uh...

26:01.208 --> 26:04.375
where shall I start?

26:04.417 --> 26:07.333
Well, first of all,

26:07.375 --> 26:10.166
you should know

26:07.375 --> 26:10.166
that I am very close

26:10.208 --> 26:14.000
to being able to collimate

26:10.208 --> 26:14.000
a Krieger field.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.375
Our guest quarters

26:18.417 --> 26:19.709
are quite modest.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.375
RIKER:

26:19.750 --> 26:21.375
Very charming.

26:21.417 --> 26:22.917
It has your touch.

26:22.959 --> 26:25.542
The station is small

26:22.959 --> 26:25.542
and we don't often have guests,

26:25.583 --> 26:27.750
so I use this

26:25.583 --> 26:27.750
as my sanctuary.

26:27.792 --> 26:30.667
Who do you need

26:27.792 --> 26:30.667
sanctuary from?

26:30.709 --> 26:34.250
The environmental

26:30.709 --> 26:34.250
controls are here.

26:34.291 --> 26:36.417
(<i> sighing</i> )

26:36.458 --> 26:38.000
Commander, please...

26:38.041 --> 26:39.959
it's late and I'm tired.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.792
A man more interested

26:40.000 --> 26:41.792
in Krieger waves

26:41.834 --> 26:43.083
than a lovely woman like you...

26:43.125 --> 26:44.375
How is that possible?

26:44.417 --> 26:46.875
My husband is one

26:44.417 --> 26:46.875
of the greatest minds

26:46.917 --> 26:48.083
in the galaxy,

26:48.125 --> 26:50.625
and we love each other

26:48.125 --> 26:50.625
very much.

26:50.667 --> 26:51.792
Please, don't.

26:51.834 --> 26:53.458
RIKER:

26:51.834 --> 26:53.458
You must be very lonely...

26:53.500 --> 26:56.083
a princess

26:53.500 --> 26:56.083
in a very high tower.

26:56.125 --> 26:58.166
Please, my husband

26:56.125 --> 26:58.166
will be looking for me.

26:58.208 --> 27:00.000
Your sanctuary, remember?

27:00.041 --> 27:01.458
Commander, don't, please!

27:01.500 --> 27:02.458
She's lying.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.000
That never happened.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.542
Freeze program.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.083
Please...

27:07.125 --> 27:10.041
Captain, you know I would

27:07.125 --> 27:10.041
never act like that.

27:10.083 --> 27:12.000
Commander Riker...

27:12.041 --> 27:13.542
This isn't me.

27:13.583 --> 27:15.458
I wasn't the one

27:13.583 --> 27:15.458
who closed the door.

27:15.500 --> 27:16.875
I didn't proposition her

27:16.917 --> 27:19.125
and I certainly didn't

27:16.917 --> 27:19.125
try to rape her.

27:20.709 --> 27:22.375
Why are you

27:20.709 --> 27:22.375
doing this?

27:22.417 --> 27:26.208
It's exactly what happened.

27:26.250 --> 27:29.792
Will, come on, sit down.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.166
Resume program.

27:46.917 --> 27:48.291
Please...

27:48.333 --> 27:50.083
I knew you'd try this, Riker.

27:50.125 --> 27:53.500
Do you think I didn't notice

27:50.125 --> 27:53.500
how you looked at her?

27:53.542 --> 27:55.959
I'm not the fool

27:53.542 --> 27:55.959
you take me for.

27:59.583 --> 28:02.917
You won't get

27:59.583 --> 28:02.917
away with this.

28:02.959 --> 28:04.250
Your career is over.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.667
I'll see to it,

28:04.291 --> 28:06.667
I swear I will, Riker.

28:06.709 --> 28:08.041
If you report this,

28:08.083 --> 28:09.959
you'll be making

28:08.083 --> 28:09.959
a terrible mistake, Doctor.

28:10.041 --> 28:12.959
A terrible mistake.

28:18.417 --> 28:21.583
Freeze program.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.792
Your career was safe.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.333
He was a scientist.

28:27.375 --> 28:29.000
In another day,

28:27.375 --> 28:29.000
some fascinating bit

28:29.041 --> 28:31.375
of technical trivia

28:29.041 --> 28:31.375
would have distracted him.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.083
He would have forgotten

28:31.417 --> 28:33.083
about you

28:33.125 --> 28:34.959
and his complaint

28:33.125 --> 28:34.959
to Starfleet.

28:36.709 --> 28:38.792
(<i> softly</i> ):

28:36.709 --> 28:38.792
Excuse me.

28:42.458 --> 28:45.375
We'll, um...

28:45.417 --> 28:48.083
we'll take a short recess.

28:57.750 --> 29:00.417
Why would she lie like that?

29:00.458 --> 29:01.875
She was lying.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.333
You could tell.

29:03.375 --> 29:08.375
Will, I didn't sense

29:03.375 --> 29:08.375
any deception from her.

29:08.417 --> 29:10.417
Then you think

29:08.417 --> 29:10.417
that I would...?

29:10.458 --> 29:12.166
No! No, of course not.

29:12.208 --> 29:13.834
I<i> know</i> you.

29:13.875 --> 29:15.333
You don't have

29:13.875 --> 29:15.333
to convince me

29:13.875 --> 29:15.333
of anything.

29:15.375 --> 29:17.667
We can't both be

29:15.375 --> 29:17.667
telling the truth.

29:17.709 --> 29:22.583
It is the truth as

29:17.709 --> 29:22.583
each of you remembers it.

29:24.375 --> 29:27.208
But her version

29:24.375 --> 29:27.208
puts a noose around my neck.

29:31.041 --> 29:32.709
This is healing

29:31.041 --> 29:32.709
beautifully.

29:32.750 --> 29:35.333
I think you can

29:32.750 --> 29:35.333
work on strengthening

29:32.750 --> 29:35.333
those muscles again.

29:35.375 --> 29:37.125
WORF:

29:35.375 --> 29:37.125
Security to Dr. Crusher.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.792
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

29:38.834 --> 29:40.250
Evacuate. Repeat, evacuate.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.709
Radiation emissions

29:40.291 --> 29:42.709
are indicated in Sick Bay.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.959
(<i> alarm continues</i> )

29:56.166 --> 29:58.583
This is definitely

29:56.166 --> 29:58.583
the same radiation

29:58.625 --> 30:00.166
that penetrated deck 39.

30:00.208 --> 30:02.583
Highly focused, very powerful,

30:00.208 --> 30:02.583
but of unknown origin.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.750
If this should happen

30:02.625 --> 30:04.750
near the engine core

30:04.792 --> 30:06.667
or the antimatter

30:04.792 --> 30:06.667
containment tanks,

30:06.709 --> 30:08.333
we'll be in

30:06.709 --> 30:08.333
big trouble, Captain.

30:08.375 --> 30:10.667
Do you have any theories?

30:10.709 --> 30:12.333
Captain, Data's

30:10.709 --> 30:12.333
noticed something

30:12.375 --> 30:14.458
that's too strange

30:12.375 --> 30:14.458
to be a coincidence.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.750
The two radiation events

30:14.500 --> 30:16.750
aboard the<i> Enterprise</i>

30:16.792 --> 30:19.458
occurred five hours, 20 minutes

30:16.792 --> 30:19.458
and three seconds apart.

30:19.500 --> 30:21.250
The science station exploded

30:19.500 --> 30:21.250
yesterday

30:21.291 --> 30:23.583
at almost four times

30:21.291 --> 30:23.583
that interval.

30:23.625 --> 30:26.834
WESLEY:

30:23.625 --> 30:26.834
There's a .0014-second variance

30:26.875 --> 30:29.291
we haven't been able

30:26.875 --> 30:29.291
to explain yet.

30:29.333 --> 30:30.834
So you're saying

30:29.333 --> 30:30.834
there's a connection

30:30.875 --> 30:33.000
between the radiation bursts

30:30.875 --> 30:33.000
and the explosion.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.959
We do not have the evidence

30:33.041 --> 30:34.959
to support that conclusion

30:35.000 --> 30:36.250
at this time, Commander.

30:36.291 --> 30:38.458
BEVERLY:

30:36.291 --> 30:38.458
If they're right,

30:38.500 --> 30:40.959
we should be able to

30:38.500 --> 30:40.959
predict the next event.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.750
We're expecting it

30:41.000 --> 30:42.750
in just over five hours.

30:42.792 --> 30:44.250
Well, take every precaution

30:44.291 --> 30:46.458
to protect the ship's

30:44.291 --> 30:46.458
vital areas.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.875
If we haven't identified

30:46.500 --> 30:48.875
the source

30:48.917 --> 30:51.959
before the next time interval,

30:48.917 --> 30:51.959
we'll leave orbit.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.792
If you perceive

30:52.000 --> 30:53.792
any further danger,

30:53.834 --> 30:55.834
advise me immediately.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.083
We'll figure it out

30:58.166 --> 31:00.083
for you, Commander.

31:12.208 --> 31:16.417
After the... the fight,

31:12.208 --> 31:16.417
Dr. Apgar came to find me.

31:16.458 --> 31:20.083
He was very upset.

31:20.125 --> 31:21.959
And he told you what happened?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Yes, he told me everything

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
that happened.

31:25.041 --> 31:26.792
Based on Tayna's deposition,

31:26.834 --> 31:30.917
we have re-created the incident

31:26.834 --> 31:30.917
in Commander Riker's quarters

31:30.959 --> 31:33.041
as Dr. Apgar described it

31:30.959 --> 31:33.041
to her.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.250
Computer...

31:34.291 --> 31:36.417
Inspector, Inspector,

31:34.291 --> 31:36.417
this is hearsay.

31:36.458 --> 31:39.083
She wasn't a witness

31:36.458 --> 31:39.083
to this incident.

31:39.125 --> 31:41.792
But Dr. Apgar is dead.

31:41.834 --> 31:45.417
Her statement is admissible

31:41.834 --> 31:45.417
according to Tanugan law

31:45.458 --> 31:48.375
and I<i> insist</i> you

31:45.458 --> 31:48.375
consider it.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.458
Well... we'll watch

31:50.000 --> 31:55.458
this "evidence"

31:55.500 --> 31:58.959
and we'll weigh it

31:55.500 --> 31:58.959
accordingly.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.959
Computer, run Tayna

31:59.000 --> 32:01.959
Simulation Three.

32:08.667 --> 32:11.041
I knew I'd find

32:08.667 --> 32:11.041
the two of you together.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.834
Do you think

32:11.083 --> 32:12.834
I didn't notice

32:12.875 --> 32:14.959
how you were looking

32:12.875 --> 32:14.959
at each other?

32:15.000 --> 32:16.792
I'm not the fool

32:16.834 --> 32:18.166
you take me for.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.625
I'm going to report this,

32:22.834 --> 32:24.625
Riker.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.875
You can count on that.

32:26.917 --> 32:28.667
You're a dead man, Apgar.

32:28.709 --> 32:30.583
A dead man.

32:30.625 --> 32:32.625
Freeze program.

32:32.667 --> 32:35.792
And then Dr. Apgar

32:32.667 --> 32:35.792
came to find you?

32:35.834 --> 32:37.583
Yes.

32:37.625 --> 32:40.291
Run Tayna Simulation Four.

32:43.917 --> 32:45.625
I want you to take Manua

32:45.667 --> 32:47.417
and beam down to

32:45.667 --> 32:47.417
Tanuga immediately.

32:47.458 --> 32:48.792
But, Doctor,

32:47.458 --> 32:48.792
if he threatened you

32:48.834 --> 32:50.000
you shouldn't stay.

32:50.041 --> 32:51.542
I'm not leaving him

32:50.041 --> 32:51.542
here alone.

32:51.583 --> 32:53.041
He's capable

32:51.583 --> 32:53.041
of anything.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.583
I've got to

32:53.083 --> 32:54.583
protect our work.

32:54.625 --> 32:56.166
I'll contact

32:54.625 --> 32:56.166
the authorities.

32:56.208 --> 32:59.333
No... I'll take

32:56.208 --> 32:59.333
care of that.

33:02.875 --> 33:05.709
Doctor, be careful.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.166
It'll be all right.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.625
Go on.

33:09.667 --> 33:12.000
KRAG:

33:09.667 --> 33:12.000
Freeze program.

33:12.041 --> 33:13.792
Then what happened?

33:13.834 --> 33:15.834
I left the station

33:13.834 --> 33:15.834
with Manua.

33:15.875 --> 33:19.667
The next day, when I heard

33:15.875 --> 33:19.667
the station had exploded,

33:19.709 --> 33:21.792
I knew what had happened.

33:21.834 --> 33:23.917
He'd killed Dr. Apgar.

33:23.959 --> 33:26.208
KRAG:

33:23.959 --> 33:26.208
Thank you.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.875
You are excused.

33:28.917 --> 33:31.333
(<i> door opens and closes</i> )

33:31.375 --> 33:35.959
Captain, I have

33:31.375 --> 33:35.959
established motive,

33:31.375 --> 33:35.959
method and opportunity.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.417
In any court

33:36.000 --> 33:38.417
in the Federation

33:38.458 --> 33:39.875
that is sufficient

33:39.917 --> 33:43.125
to warrant the extradition

33:39.917 --> 33:43.125
of the accused.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.417
I await your

33:43.166 --> 33:46.417
decision forthwith.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.500
I don't see

33:57.125 --> 33:59.500
any alternative.

33:59.542 --> 34:00.500
Do you?

34:00.542 --> 34:02.333
We both know Will's innocent.

34:02.375 --> 34:04.000
Of course he's innocent!

34:04.041 --> 34:07.041
But as a Starfleet Captain,

34:04.041 --> 34:07.041
I can't allow myself the luxury

34:07.083 --> 34:12.041
of yielding

34:07.083 --> 34:12.041
to personal feelings.

34:12.083 --> 34:14.625
The evidence warrants a trial.

34:14.667 --> 34:17.125
I'll have to allow extradition.

34:17.166 --> 34:20.709
Do you think

34:17.166 --> 34:20.709
there's enough evidence

34:20.750 --> 34:22.667
to prove his innocence?

34:24.542 --> 34:25.917
No.

34:25.959 --> 34:28.166
DATA:

34:25.959 --> 34:28.166
Captain, I believe we have found

34:28.208 --> 34:29.875
the source of the radiation.

34:29.917 --> 34:31.458
Can you join us on the Bridge?

34:31.500 --> 34:32.792
Acknowledged.

34:37.041 --> 34:41.000
As you know, Captain,

34:37.041 --> 34:41.000
we are looking for

34:37.041 --> 34:41.000
a phenomenon

34:41.041 --> 34:42.291
that reoccurs

34:41.041 --> 34:42.291
every five hours

34:42.333 --> 34:43.834
20 minutes and

34:42.333 --> 34:43.834
three seconds.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.583
The interval between

34:43.875 --> 34:45.583
the radiation bursts.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.291
We have found one

34:45.625 --> 34:47.291
such phenomenon

34:47.333 --> 34:48.583
on the

34:47.333 --> 34:48.583
planet surface.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.000
It's the field generator

34:48.625 --> 34:50.000
that Apgar used

34:50.041 --> 34:51.333
during his research.

34:51.375 --> 34:52.625
When it's fully charged

34:52.667 --> 34:54.375
it automatically emits

34:52.667 --> 34:54.375
an energy pulse

34:54.417 --> 34:55.875
and then takes five hours

34:55.917 --> 34:58.667
20 minutes and three seconds

34:55.917 --> 34:58.667
to recharge itself.

34:58.709 --> 35:01.208
It must have been left on

34:58.709 --> 35:01.208
after the explosion at the lab.

35:01.250 --> 35:02.875
But why would

35:01.250 --> 35:02.875
a generator

35:02.917 --> 35:05.417
be affecting the

35:02.917 --> 35:05.417
<i>Enterprise</i> in this way?

35:05.458 --> 35:06.750
It should not be.

35:06.792 --> 35:09.291
It is a harmless

35:06.792 --> 35:09.291
lambda field generator.

35:09.333 --> 35:11.250
LA FORGE:

35:09.333 --> 35:11.250
But we knew that somehow

35:09.333 --> 35:11.250
it was related

35:11.291 --> 35:12.792
to our radiation bursts,

35:12.834 --> 35:14.500
and then the pieces

35:12.834 --> 35:14.500
just started falling together.

35:14.542 --> 35:16.583
We now know

35:14.542 --> 35:16.583
what is causing the bursts

35:16.625 --> 35:18.583
and why the science station

35:16.625 --> 35:18.583
exploded, sir.

35:18.625 --> 35:21.709
And we also know

35:18.625 --> 35:21.709
who killed Dr. Apgar.

35:38.750 --> 35:42.875
Chief Inspector,

35:38.750 --> 35:42.875
we've watched these events

35:42.917 --> 35:45.333
replayed over and over again

35:45.375 --> 35:47.667
and... I am impressed

35:47.709 --> 35:51.959
and admittedly dismayed

35:52.000 --> 35:55.500
by the body of evidence

35:52.000 --> 35:55.500
against Commander Riker.

35:55.542 --> 35:59.667
But isn't it remarkable

35:55.542 --> 35:59.667
that with all the witnesses,

35:59.709 --> 36:01.542
all the different points

35:59.709 --> 36:01.542
of view

36:01.583 --> 36:05.000
of the events

36:01.583 --> 36:05.000
aboard the space station,

36:05.041 --> 36:08.333
we haven't seen

36:05.041 --> 36:08.333
what really happened?

36:08.375 --> 36:10.625
I do not understand.

36:10.667 --> 36:14.333
Allow me, with the help

36:10.667 --> 36:14.333
of Mr. La Forge, to explain.

36:14.375 --> 36:17.875
Computer, load

36:14.375 --> 36:17.875
Manua Program One,

36:17.917 --> 36:22.875
time index 14-4-1.

36:22.917 --> 36:24.875
Play program.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.291
Fine, whatever.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.667
Starfleet will get

36:26.333 --> 36:28.667
its Krieger-wave converter.

36:28.709 --> 36:29.917
These things take time.

36:29.959 --> 36:31.667
I've had a few setbacks,

36:29.959 --> 36:31.667
that's all.

36:31.709 --> 36:33.208
PICARD:

36:31.709 --> 36:33.208
Freeze.

36:33.250 --> 36:35.709
Mrs. Apgar, this

36:33.250 --> 36:35.709
is taken from

36:33.250 --> 36:35.709
your deposition.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.834
It would seem to suggest

36:35.750 --> 36:37.834
that your husband

36:37.875 --> 36:39.542
had failed to create

36:37.875 --> 36:39.542
Krieger waves.

36:39.583 --> 36:41.667
Yes, but he was very close

36:39.583 --> 36:41.667
to a breakthrough.

36:41.709 --> 36:43.083
He said he

36:41.709 --> 36:43.083
needed more time.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.375
He was upset

36:43.125 --> 36:45.375
by our early arrival.

36:45.417 --> 36:47.375
Where in fact, I maintain

36:47.417 --> 36:50.834
that he had already made

36:47.417 --> 36:50.834
that breakthrough

36:50.875 --> 36:53.000
and that he was lying to us.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.250
On what basis?

36:54.291 --> 36:55.667
LA FORGE:

36:54.291 --> 36:55.667
For the last several hours

36:55.709 --> 36:57.917
the<i> Enterprise</i>

36:55.709 --> 36:57.917
has been experiencing

36:57.959 --> 36:59.792
unusual radiation bursts.

36:59.834 --> 37:02.291
We've identified them

36:59.834 --> 37:02.291
as Krieger waves.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.500
Krieger waves?

37:03.542 --> 37:04.583
But that's impossible.

37:04.625 --> 37:05.792
From where?

37:05.834 --> 37:08.291
From right here

37:05.834 --> 37:08.291
inside the holodeck.

37:08.333 --> 37:10.625
PICARD:

37:08.333 --> 37:10.625
We have re-created

37:08.333 --> 37:10.625
your science lab

37:10.667 --> 37:12.291
in every conceivable detail.

37:12.333 --> 37:15.709
Essentially, what was

37:12.333 --> 37:15.709
in the original lab is here.

37:15.750 --> 37:17.583
Including

37:15.750 --> 37:17.583
the Krieger-wave converter

37:17.625 --> 37:20.750
that Dr. Apgar claimed didn't

37:17.625 --> 37:20.750
work, except it does work.

37:20.792 --> 37:23.000
Your field generator

37:20.792 --> 37:23.000
down on the planet surface

37:23.041 --> 37:25.250
has been sending out

37:23.041 --> 37:25.250
harmless energy charges,

37:25.291 --> 37:31.667
which this facsimile has been

37:25.291 --> 37:31.667
converting into Krieger waves.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.625
But the holodeck can't

37:31.709 --> 37:33.625
create anything dangerous.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.875
Well, it didn't.

37:35.917 --> 37:39.333
When you get down to basics,

37:35.917 --> 37:39.333
the converter is nothing more

37:39.375 --> 37:42.709
than a complex series of mirrors

37:39.375 --> 37:42.709
and reflective coils.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.750
The energy from

37:42.750 --> 37:44.750
the field generator

37:44.792 --> 37:46.709
down on the planet

37:46.750 --> 37:48.542
simply reflects off of elements

37:46.750 --> 37:48.542
in the converter,

37:48.583 --> 37:52.417
which turns it into

37:48.583 --> 37:52.417
highly focused Krieger waves.

37:52.458 --> 37:54.250
And those same

37:52.458 --> 37:54.250
waves have been

37:54.291 --> 37:56.208
randomly striking

37:54.291 --> 37:56.208
different areas

37:54.291 --> 37:56.208
of our ship

37:56.250 --> 37:57.875
as we orbit

37:56.250 --> 37:57.875
the planet

37:57.917 --> 38:00.917
and our angle to the

37:57.917 --> 38:00.917
generator changes.

38:00.959 --> 38:04.166
Why would Dr. Apgar lie

38:00.959 --> 38:04.166
about his success?

38:04.208 --> 38:09.166
Computer, run

38:04.208 --> 38:09.166
Manua Program One,

38:04.208 --> 38:09.166
time index 14-3-8.

38:11.125 --> 38:14.917
Manua, someday

38:11.125 --> 38:14.917
I'll be able

38:11.125 --> 38:14.917
to reward you

38:14.959 --> 38:16.792
for all your patience.

38:16.834 --> 38:20.417
I'll get you everything

38:16.834 --> 38:20.417
you ever dreamed of.

38:20.458 --> 38:23.000
I have all the reward I need.

38:23.041 --> 38:24.959
PICARD:

38:23.041 --> 38:24.959
Freeze program.

38:25.000 --> 38:32.083
Computer, run Riker Program Two,

38:25.000 --> 38:32.083
time index 16-1-0.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.417
To your success, Doctor.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.250
And the rewards

38:37.458 --> 38:40.250
that come with it.

38:40.291 --> 38:42.375
PICARD:

38:40.291 --> 38:42.375
Freeze.

38:42.417 --> 38:44.375
I never said that.

38:44.417 --> 38:46.500
Nevertheless,

38:44.417 --> 38:46.500
it seems clear

38:44.417 --> 38:46.500
that your husband

38:46.542 --> 38:49.542
was motivated to

38:46.542 --> 38:49.542
earn the rewards

38:46.542 --> 38:49.542
that pleased you,

38:49.583 --> 38:51.166
Mrs. Apgar.

38:51.208 --> 38:52.291
What's wrong with that?

38:52.333 --> 38:53.959
TROI:

38:52.333 --> 38:53.959
Well, he

38:52.333 --> 38:53.959
wouldn't have

38:54.000 --> 38:56.959
earned great profits from

38:54.000 --> 38:56.959
his dealings with Starfleet.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.709
We were only interested

38:57.000 --> 38:59.709
in a new power source.

38:59.750 --> 39:01.959
But if he could turn this

38:59.750 --> 39:01.959
into a weapon,

39:02.000 --> 39:03.458
it would be worth a lot

39:03.500 --> 39:05.625
to the Romulans, the Ferengi,

39:03.500 --> 39:05.625
and a few others.

39:05.667 --> 39:08.667
Now, Dr. Apgar had been ordering

39:05.667 --> 39:08.667
extra dicosilium for months.

39:08.709 --> 39:10.291
That's a pretty good indication

39:10.333 --> 39:11.750
that he was trying to create

39:10.333 --> 39:11.750
larger reflective coils.

39:11.792 --> 39:14.667
And when the away team

39:11.792 --> 39:14.667
arrived early,

39:14.709 --> 39:16.000
he must have been worried

39:16.041 --> 39:18.208
that Starfleet

39:16.041 --> 39:18.208
was becoming suspicious.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.417
He needed more time

39:20.000 --> 39:22.417
to finish his work.

39:22.458 --> 39:25.125
Apgar said that

39:22.458 --> 39:25.125
in each of the three versions.

39:25.166 --> 39:28.417
No doubt he was afraid

39:28.458 --> 39:31.542
that Commander Riker

39:28.458 --> 39:31.542
might learn the truth

39:31.583 --> 39:34.875
and cut off his support

39:31.583 --> 39:34.875
prematurely.

39:38.625 --> 39:40.750
Discovering

39:38.625 --> 39:40.750
Commander Riker

39:38.625 --> 39:40.750
with his wife

39:40.792 --> 39:43.083
didn't help matters.

39:43.125 --> 39:46.709
I submit he

39:43.125 --> 39:46.709
decided to murder

39:43.125 --> 39:46.709
Commander Riker.

39:46.750 --> 39:49.542
Ridiculous.

39:49.583 --> 39:51.208
Is it?

39:51.250 --> 39:54.417
Computer, run Tayna

39:51.250 --> 39:54.417
Program Four,

39:54.458 --> 39:58.750
time index 18-1-4.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.291
I'll contact the authorities.

40:04.333 --> 40:07.917
No... I'll take

40:04.333 --> 40:07.917
care of that.

40:09.959 --> 40:12.083
PICARD:

40:09.959 --> 40:12.083
Freeze.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.917
Tayna, what exactly

40:12.125 --> 40:14.917
is Apgar doing here?

40:14.959 --> 40:18.041
Activating the generator

40:14.959 --> 40:18.041
on the planet.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.041
Now, why would he do that?

40:20.083 --> 40:23.542
Maybe he was going to work

40:20.083 --> 40:23.542
on the converter.

40:23.583 --> 40:24.834
I don't know.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.959
Maybe he was already

40:24.875 --> 40:26.959
thinking ahead

40:27.000 --> 40:30.083
to his next confrontation

40:27.000 --> 40:30.083
with Commander Riker.

40:30.125 --> 40:32.875
Computer, play

40:30.125 --> 40:32.875
Riker Program Four,

40:32.917 --> 40:36.792
time index 24-1.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.750
What are you going

40:39.500 --> 40:40.750
to put in your

40:39.500 --> 40:40.750
report, Riker?

40:40.792 --> 40:42.542
That there's

40:40.792 --> 40:42.542
no justification

40:42.583 --> 40:44.083
for all the

40:42.583 --> 40:44.083
extra dicosilium

40:42.583 --> 40:44.083
I've requested?

40:44.125 --> 40:46.417
That is why they sent

40:44.125 --> 40:46.417
you early, isn't it?

40:46.458 --> 40:47.709
Doctor...

40:47.750 --> 40:49.250
I can explain

40:47.750 --> 40:49.250
why I needed it.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.458
They have no idea

40:49.291 --> 40:51.458
what my problems are.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.000
There are

40:51.500 --> 40:53.000
explanations for...

40:53.041 --> 40:54.500
I don't need explanations.

40:54.542 --> 40:56.333
PICARD:

40:54.542 --> 40:56.333
Freeze.

40:56.375 --> 40:58.959
To Apgar, this must have

40:56.375 --> 40:58.959
seemed as though

40:59.000 --> 41:01.333
Commander Riker

40:59.000 --> 41:01.333
were confirming

40:59.000 --> 41:01.333
his worst fears,

41:01.375 --> 41:03.959
and I believe it was now

41:04.000 --> 41:06.208
that he finally decided

41:04.000 --> 41:06.208
to kill him.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.208
KRAG:

41:06.250 --> 41:08.208
You forget, Picard.

41:08.250 --> 41:12.208
We know that the energy pulse

41:08.250 --> 41:12.208
which blew up the reactor

41:12.250 --> 41:15.000
originated from

41:12.250 --> 41:15.000
Commander Riker's position

41:15.041 --> 41:16.542
not Dr. Apgar's.

41:16.583 --> 41:19.083
Hmm... We are hypothesizing

41:19.125 --> 41:21.417
that Dr. Apgar energized

41:19.125 --> 41:21.417
the converter

41:21.458 --> 41:24.000
at the moment

41:21.458 --> 41:24.000
of Commander

41:21.458 --> 41:24.000
Riker's beam-out,

41:24.041 --> 41:26.542
hoping to make his

41:24.041 --> 41:26.542
death look like a

41:24.041 --> 41:26.542
transporter accident,

41:26.583 --> 41:28.250
but something

41:26.583 --> 41:28.250
went wrong.

41:28.291 --> 41:31.000
The energy pulse hit

41:28.291 --> 41:31.000
the transporter beam

41:31.041 --> 41:32.417
and reflected back

41:32.458 --> 41:35.250
to the reactor,

41:32.458 --> 41:35.250
which caused

41:32.458 --> 41:35.250
the explosion.

41:35.291 --> 41:39.333
An interesting hypothesis,

41:35.291 --> 41:39.333
but impossible to prove.

41:39.375 --> 41:41.542
LA FORGE:

41:39.375 --> 41:41.542
Not really.

41:41.583 --> 41:43.291
We know that field generator

41:41.583 --> 41:43.291
on the planet

41:43.333 --> 41:45.625
has been repeating a discharge

41:43.333 --> 41:45.625
ever since the explosion.

41:45.667 --> 41:46.917
The intervals are like clockwork

41:46.959 --> 41:49.375
<i>except</i> the explosion occurred

41:49.417 --> 41:53.417
.0014 seconds

41:49.417 --> 41:53.417
after the initial discharge.

41:53.458 --> 41:55.208
Now, the only explanation

41:53.458 --> 41:55.208
for that variance

41:55.250 --> 41:57.834
is the time it would take

41:55.250 --> 41:57.834
the energy pulse to bounce back

41:57.875 --> 42:00.250
from the transporter

41:57.875 --> 42:00.250
beam to the reactor.

42:00.291 --> 42:02.458
We've arranged a demonstration

42:00.291 --> 42:02.458
to illustrate.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.000
Mr. La Forge, I think

42:02.500 --> 42:05.000
it's about time, isn't it?

42:05.041 --> 42:08.166
Computer, load program

42:05.041 --> 42:08.166
La Forge One.

42:08.208 --> 42:11.792
Coordinate auto-engage

42:08.208 --> 42:11.792
time sequence.

42:11.834 --> 42:13.625
The next discharge

42:11.834 --> 42:13.625
from the field generator

42:13.667 --> 42:16.041
is scheduled to

42:13.667 --> 42:16.041
occur in just

42:13.667 --> 42:16.041
a few moments.

42:16.083 --> 42:17.792
Now, we've aligned

42:16.083 --> 42:17.792
the holodeck program

42:17.834 --> 42:19.375
to re-create the final events

42:19.417 --> 42:21.542
as Commander Riker

42:19.417 --> 42:21.542
described them,

42:21.583 --> 42:24.709
only this time, our facsimile

42:21.583 --> 42:24.709
will automatically process

42:24.750 --> 42:26.709
the energy charge

42:24.750 --> 42:26.709
from the planet

42:26.750 --> 42:29.709
and reflect it just

42:26.750 --> 42:29.709
as the original converter did

42:29.750 --> 42:31.291
before the explosion.

42:31.333 --> 42:35.709
If we're correct,

42:31.333 --> 42:35.709
we'll know it instantly.

42:35.750 --> 42:39.709
COMPUTER:

42:35.750 --> 42:39.709
Auto-engage time sequence

42:35.750 --> 42:39.709
synchronized.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.542
Then we have

42:39.750 --> 42:41.542
nothing further

42:41.583 --> 42:43.458
to say to each other.

42:43.500 --> 42:46.083
I'll tell my Captain

42:43.500 --> 42:46.083
to expect your grievance.

42:46.125 --> 42:48.375
Do that.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.375
Riker to<i> Enterprise.</i>

42:50.417 --> 42:52.208
I'm ready to leave now.

42:52.250 --> 42:53.709
O'BRIEN:

42:52.250 --> 42:53.709
Stand by, Commander.

42:53.750 --> 42:56.583
Engaging transport.

43:19.250 --> 43:21.709
Dr. Apgar killed himself

43:21.750 --> 43:25.125
during his attempt

43:21.750 --> 43:25.125
to kill Commander Riker.

43:31.250 --> 43:35.834
Based on this new evidence,

43:31.250 --> 43:35.834
I withdraw my request

43:35.875 --> 43:38.125
for Commander Riker's

43:35.875 --> 43:38.125
extradition.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.500
Commander...

43:40.542 --> 43:42.792
my apologies.

43:51.125 --> 43:54.333
Number One, have we

43:51.125 --> 43:54.333
any further business

43:54.375 --> 43:55.917
in the Tanuga system?

43:55.959 --> 43:57.375
None that I know of.

43:57.417 --> 43:58.750
I'd be more than willing

43:57.417 --> 43:58.750
to put it behind me.

43:58.792 --> 44:00.250
Then perhaps

43:58.792 --> 44:00.250
you would do me the pleasure

44:00.291 --> 44:01.834
of getting this ship underway.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.000
With pleasure, sir.

44:03.041 --> 44:04.291
Ensign Crusher,

44:04.333 --> 44:07.959
set course

44:04.333 --> 44:07.959
for Emila II,

44:04.333 --> 44:07.959
warp three.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.417
Course laid in, sir.

44:09.458 --> 44:11.208
Engage.
