Will you marry me?

00:04.004 --> 00:05.573
Yes.
I'm pregnant.

00:05.606 --> 00:07.475
So?
It's Hakeem's.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.043
You know, a lot of women,

00:11.179 --> 00:13.147

00:37.271 --> 00:40.508

HAKEEM:
They did it.

They voted me out.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.179

Any one, doesn't matter.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.552
You look beautiful.
Nice group of people.

JAMAL:
It's not enough to be nominated.
I do want to win.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.088
It's been a crazy year
for my family

03:08.121 --> 03:09.490
and there's been
some doubters.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.725
I feel like to win would
be a big up to my fans.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.594
Talking about the people
who doubted you,

03:13.627 --> 03:15.829
you seemed like you were
poised for a ASA sweep

03:15.863 --> 03:17.498
till your
father's video hit.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.733
That dude's comin'
to take you out.

03:19.767 --> 03:22.336
Nah, man, maybe so, but, uh,
it's-it's not a boxing match.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.171
Well, maybe someone
should tell him that.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.673
Well, maybe someone should tell
the press to leave us alone

03:25.706 --> 03:27.107
with the negative...
Uh, you know what,
you know what?

03:27.140 --> 03:28.842
I promise you this,
whatever those rumors

03:28.876 --> 03:30.344
you're hearing
about my family,

03:30.378 --> 03:32.846
they're just that,
baby, media lies.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.181
See, 'cause the Lyons, baby,

03:34.214 --> 03:35.516
we are closer,
we are tighter than...

03:35.549 --> 03:37.117
The Manson Family.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.519
Right?
Don't listen to this bitch,

03:38.552 --> 03:40.187
She don't know what
she's talking about.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.790
Besides, we're more like
the black Partridge Family,

03:42.823 --> 03:44.224
you know?
(laughs)

03:44.258 --> 03:46.360
I do know what
I'm talking about.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.028
Stop moping, boy.

03:48.061 --> 03:51.031
Lucious is doing exactly
what a big superstar does.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.033
And if you want to be bigger
than him, like you say you do...

03:53.066 --> 03:54.935
I will be bigger than him,
and I'm gonna win.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.704
But it's like
this is just stupid,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.372

Ma, just coming with...

03:58.406 --> 04:00.874
Stop it.

Now, Empire has a lot
riding on these ASAs, Jamal.

04:04.512 --> 04:07.815
We need to get that board to
officially reinstate Lucious,

04:07.848 --> 04:10.050
or I don't know who the hell
is going to run my company.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.552
So is this a
best-man-win situation

04:11.585 --> 04:13.654
or a me-help-him situation?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.222
It's neither one, dummy.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.125
All right, Ma.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.561
Make sure that you don't
get caught up in him again.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.962
(sighs)

04:21.995 --> 04:24.231
It's pretty rare for a man
with your rep,

04:24.264 --> 04:25.899
from your culture,

04:25.933 --> 04:27.901
to admit to having suffered
from childhood abuse.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.471
Well,
one of the wonderful things

04:30.504 --> 04:32.239
that I learned
in making this video,

04:32.272 --> 04:33.574
is the fact that...

04:33.607 --> 04:36.477
the people with real
courage are those

04:36.510 --> 04:38.912
who have suffered
with mental illness.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.848
Oh, really? Well, I
don't think you realize

04:40.881 --> 04:42.350
there are more
people in this room.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.584
Like ASA voters.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.752
Come on.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.919
I will see you soon.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.488
Ten minutes-- I'm sorry.
Yes.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.022
Keep rolling.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.924
Hey, you're gonna have to
get your emotions in check.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.192
Harper happens
to have the hottest blog

04:52.225 --> 04:53.661
in the music business,

04:53.694 --> 04:54.862
and if she could
put me on the cover,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.096
man, that-that raises my odds.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.197
Watch it.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.099
It is disrespectful of you

04:59.132 --> 05:00.334
and quite childish for you

05:00.368 --> 05:02.703
to try to put this
on my emotions.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.204
What you're about to do is ruin

05:04.237 --> 05:05.939
the truce you
got going with Jamal.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.941
What? If he can't
handle the heat...
Uh...

05:07.975 --> 05:08.942
the boy should
get out the kitchen.

05:08.976 --> 05:09.943
Shut up.
You get out the kitchen,

05:09.977 --> 05:10.944
son, I got the better song.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.446
Which one?
My song, "Heavy."

05:12.480 --> 05:15.215
Okay, hey, hey, y'all, hey.
Which one?
Thank you.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.117
Now that you're all liquored up,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.386
I know y'all have some questions

05:18.419 --> 05:19.687
for the first family of music,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.121
so shoot.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.223
Now, I know he said it's
not a boxing match,

05:23.256 --> 05:25.125
but Jamal was the favorite

05:25.158 --> 05:28.362
on every list, so, I mean,
isn't this kind of like

05:28.396 --> 05:29.963
Balboa-Creed?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.199
Wait, wait.
First and foremost,

05:32.232 --> 05:37.805
um, me and my son are not the
only people up for this award,

05:37.838 --> 05:39.072
but if this was a boxing match,

05:39.106 --> 05:40.474
it would be more like

05:40.508 --> 05:43.143
Foreman in his prime
versus De La Hoya.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.812
I'm just saying,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.346
I'm ready to play,
you ready to play?

05:49.249 --> 05:51.018
I was born to play.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.088
Let's play.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.190

06:01.361 --> 06:04.832
Oh, here come your goon

06:04.865 --> 06:06.500
Hey, Cookie.
Hey.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.701
Always a pleasure.
Mm-hmm.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.439
Hey, Luc, can we, uh,
chop it up in private?

06:11.472 --> 06:15.008
Anything you need to say to me,
you can say around Skeletor.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.678
All them bones I done buried.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.179
Okeydokey.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.948
Well, Lucious, as you
officially don't know,

06:20.981 --> 06:22.916
I have not been spying
on our board members.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.952
But if I was,
I would tell you that

06:24.985 --> 06:26.920
a few members are
pushing real hard

06:26.954 --> 06:28.355
to bring in a new CEO.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.457
Uh-uh.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.191
An outsider to run my company?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.560
Mmm, our company.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.262
Well, that ain't
gonna happen.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.297
I don't know how many of these
white folks I'm gonna have to...

06:37.330 --> 06:40.033
Ah, Lucious, uh-uh.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.704
Not after two dead lesbos
and a strangled cat.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
I mean, listen to her,
she's right.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.474
I mean, as much as
it would bring me joy,

06:46.507 --> 06:48.041
it's not the right time
for that.
No.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.710
No.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.211
We got the shareholders
right where we want them,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.980
we just got to push.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.883
The way I see it, we got all
these cameras on us right now.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.551
THIRSTY: Mm-hmm.
Because of these ASAs.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.220
If they see my family's
united behind me,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.289
then it's the next
logical step for the board

07:02.322 --> 07:04.057
to reinstate me, right?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.659
Well, yeah, I'm having
a little flashback--

07:05.693 --> 07:07.561
I think we tried that
a couple times, all right?

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
I mean, I don't want
to be that guy,

07:09.262 --> 07:10.831
but do you really believe
you can get your three sons

07:10.864 --> 07:12.566
to rally behind
Don Dada here?

07:12.600 --> 07:14.067
I mean, what's the odds?

07:14.101 --> 07:16.436
Well, they all need
a whole lot of hand-holding.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.841
Hey.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.577
Are you trying
to save your company,

07:23.611 --> 07:26.279
or are you trying
to catch a STD?

07:32.119 --> 07:34.021
Morning, Ma.
Sorry I kept you waiting.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.489
Hmm, it's okay, baby.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.858
I've been working
the phones all morning.

07:37.891 --> 07:42.329
The board wants to offer
Brigham Lang the CEO job.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.698
He knows how to
run family brands.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.099
No. Uh-uh, Andre.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.267
We cannot go through that again.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.436
So let me guess.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.940
The family needs
to present a united front,

07:52.973 --> 07:55.442
and you want me to
talk to my brothers

07:55.475 --> 07:57.778
and pretend it's not
coming from you, right?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.346
Exactly.
Especially to Jamal.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.549
He thinks I'm
sprung on Lucious.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.417
Are you?

08:07.721 --> 08:10.290
Never mind, doesn't matter.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.025
If you ask Jamal,

08:12.059 --> 08:14.127
he'll think you're letting
Lucious manipulate you.

08:14.161 --> 08:16.363
Exactly.
I'll make it happen.

08:16.396 --> 08:18.298
And I'll put something together.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.968
Really big. I mean, a blowout.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.970
They're seeing
all of us up there.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.805
We'll remind that board
what they get

08:24.838 --> 08:27.307
when the Lyons run the Empire.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.879
I have an idea that could
make the event even bigger.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.481
Hmm?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.084
Tie in a fund-raiser

08:37.117 --> 08:40.020
with the National Alliance
for Bipolar Disorder.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.691
And make me the spokesperson.

08:50.463 --> 08:55.268
You mean, like, you, uh,
going public about your...

08:57.270 --> 08:58.939
I think it's time.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.108
It's a good cause,

09:01.141 --> 09:04.878
and it would really show
the board family values.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.517
That's brilliant, Dre.

09:10.550 --> 09:15.522
Yeah, going public
about his bipolar son.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.693
That makes your father even more
of a hero for doing that video.

09:19.727 --> 09:20.961
Lucious will love it.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.362
And the board will love him.

09:22.395 --> 09:26.066
I'll tell him
it's all your idea.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.938
HAKEEM:
I was good at being the boss,

09:30.971 --> 09:34.875
but my family didn't
believe in me.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.111
CHICKEN:
Yeah, but with all
this ass here, though,

09:38.145 --> 09:41.214
why are you worried?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.450
Marcel,
pass me another bottle, man.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.785
Come on.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.054
Another thousand-dollar bottle,
man, give me that.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.322
* I keep my money
in the rubber bands *

09:49.356 --> 09:52.392
* I got some customers--
they waitin' on me *

09:52.425 --> 09:55.395
* I got some chicks--
they be waitin' on me... *

09:55.428 --> 09:56.964
MARCEL:
Yo.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.498
Guess who showed up.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.734
Who?
It's Laura, bro.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
* I got that cook up
from the kitchen, man *

10:02.302 --> 10:03.904
* I got that cook up from
the kitchen, man *

10:03.937 --> 10:05.973
* I got that...

10:06.006 --> 10:07.841
Laura, what you doing here?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.643
Remember that stupid app you
and your high-ass friends

10:09.677 --> 10:11.411
have been working on?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.814
The one that lets your fans
know about the pop-up shows?

10:13.847 --> 10:15.015
Well, you left it on.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.416
You're all over Instagram,

10:16.449 --> 10:17.985
and now a million trolls
are blowing me up.

10:18.018 --> 10:21.689
Babe, listen,

10:21.722 --> 10:23.757
I thought I lost everything.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.592
If you take an "L," you're
supposed to come to me,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.360
not this thirst trap.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.896
Excuse you?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.331
Look, I thought that you
had bailed on me

10:31.364 --> 10:32.532
like everybody else.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.601
Hakeem, we're engaged.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.103
As long as you
keep it real with me,

10:36.136 --> 10:38.538
I'm here for you,
regardless what you lose.

10:38.571 --> 10:40.273
You don't care I'm not CEO?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.442
No, that's not why I'm with you.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.610
You don't care I'm not up

10:43.643 --> 10:45.445
for Rapper of the Year?
No.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.447
You don't care
I got Anika pregnant?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.217
* I got that paper
from the paper bands... *

10:50.250 --> 10:51.618
What?

10:51.651 --> 10:54.287
Anika got pregnant
before we got together.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.389
* I got some customers--
they waitin' on me *

10:56.423 --> 10:58.558
* I got some customers-- they
waitin' on me *

10:58.591 --> 11:00.828
* I got some chicks--
they be waitin' on me *

11:00.861 --> 11:03.563
* I got some haters--
they be waitin' on me *

11:03.596 --> 11:04.832
* I'm never on time
so they're waitin' on me. *

11:11.438 --> 11:13.240
Bro, let me get some coffee.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.575
You smell like
stripper ass.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.845
Stripper ass smells good.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.346
Take them.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.882
Champagne hangovers
are the worst, man.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.083
You need to get
your head straight

11:23.116 --> 11:24.818
so we can help Mom
pull off her event.

11:24.852 --> 11:27.654
Why do you keep trying to talk
to me about Mom's ASA thing?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.189
When my girl just
broke up our engagement.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.858
Did she actually
break it off, though?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.259
Did she actually say it's over?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.861
She slapped me
at the strip club.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.896
I don't get it, every
time I do everything right,

11:35.929 --> 11:37.164
everything go wrong.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.032
You think you did
everything right?

11:39.066 --> 11:41.368
Bro, if you're trying
to lecture me right now, don't.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.702
You don't know what it's like.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.471
I got this kid coming.
Hey.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.841
ANDRE:
Yeah, you got it
pretty rough, Hakeem.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.943
I guess I just had it easy, man.
Dre, you know...

11:49.977 --> 11:51.711
No, no, no, let's just
baby the baby boy, okay?

11:51.745 --> 11:53.580
You know, I mean,
I lost my kid, right?

11:53.613 --> 11:56.283
But let's just
pamper Hakeem again.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.885
Bro, that's not what
I'm trying to say.

11:57.918 --> 12:00.287
It's just right now I just suck
at every point of life.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.222
He really does.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.723
Seriously.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.926
(laughter)
I'm sorry.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.561
I guess in your own
ass-backwards way,

12:08.595 --> 12:10.730
you had a sort of
impressive run.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.465
Mm-hmm.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.235
That's true, man, you was a wild
CEO, but you were making moves.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.038
Yeah, a mash-up
between DMX and Bill Gates.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.606
(laughter)

12:21.674 --> 12:24.711
Mom needs us, guys.

12:24.744 --> 12:25.979
All right,
ASAs are important to her,

12:26.013 --> 12:28.748
and that's enough to
make me want to help.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.717
Dre, this is weird to me,
though.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.287
You, of all people, doing
a bipolar event for Lucious.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.089
Look, it's not for him,
it's for Mom.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.425
I'm starting to feel like that's
the same thing these days.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.760
Wait, are you saying Mom
is falling for Lucious?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.462
Hell no.

12:42.495 --> 12:45.232
I ain't getting King Kong
and Godzilla back together.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.900
Look at it like this, Hakeem,

12:46.934 --> 12:48.902
if you think that you deserve
a shot at getting Laura back,

12:48.936 --> 12:50.737
shouldn't, shouldn't
Lucious get a shot

12:50.770 --> 12:52.739
at getting Cookie back?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.075
And, Jamal, you know,
you-you wanted an ASA

12:55.108 --> 12:56.776
since you were in diapers.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.079
You gonna let Lucious
knock you off your game?

12:59.112 --> 13:00.180
Whatever, Dre.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.915
(laughter)

13:01.949 --> 13:03.917
You know there
was a time when Dad

13:03.951 --> 13:05.752
would have
called you a sissy,

13:05.785 --> 13:07.287
and you would
have gone running

13:07.320 --> 13:10.157
and crying
to Aunt Carol.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.626
I don't think that's
who you are anymore.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.333
*

13:20.367 --> 13:22.169
JAMAL: Look at this,

13:22.202 --> 13:23.803
Mom and Andre got me ho'ing
for Lucious and this charity.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.005
(scoffs) As usual.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.208
Some things never change.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.011
Hey, Becky.
Oh...

13:31.044 --> 13:33.113
Hey, Michael.
Jamal.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.483
I, uh, I work
for the event caterer.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.952
But, I mean,
if that's not cool with you...

13:38.986 --> 13:41.288
Nah, nah, nah, it's cool.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.655
It's-it's a good gig.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.191
Wouldn't want you to lose out.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.293
So, are we going to discuss

13:46.326 --> 13:47.794
this whole
Chase One thing?
Becky.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.896
'Cause I never got...

13:50.197 --> 13:53.666
Okay.
I'll see you later, Michael.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.502
See you, Becky.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.840
I saw a clip of that press event
you did a couple nights ago.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.209
Yeah.

14:02.242 --> 14:03.810
Lucious looked like
he was getting ready

14:03.843 --> 14:05.178
to punch your lights out.

14:05.212 --> 14:08.315
It's so twisted,
and all the politics

14:08.348 --> 14:10.350
got me wanting to snap.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.853
Um, I have a break
in a couple minutes,

14:13.887 --> 14:15.355
if you want to talk.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.559
But if you don't, it's fine.
I want to.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.794
Michael.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.698
("Better Man" by Leon Bridges
playing)

14:28.068 --> 14:30.503
* I don't want much...

14:30.537 --> 14:33.373
Look at this place.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.076
It hasn't changed one bit,

14:36.109 --> 14:38.411
since that night we met.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.847
I remember that night.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.250
It's one of my first,
like, real performances.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.053
Mm-hmm. And you didn't tell
anyone in your family.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.021
Hell no. (laughs)

14:48.055 --> 14:51.891
(band playing slow ballad)

14:51.925 --> 14:55.262
I mean, look at them.
I miss that, man.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.530
You see how
they're not concerned

14:57.564 --> 15:00.367
with show business politics?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.102
It's just about real music.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.771
And they don't care whether this
was a stadium or a coffeehouse.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.874
They'd probably sing on
the street if they had to.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.876
Jamal Lyon is in the house.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.544
Why don't you come
up here and join us?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.579
Come sit in.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.780
Nah, man, I love y'all.

15:13.813 --> 15:14.914
I'm gonna...
I'm-a just watch.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.384
It's all good.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.221
* Hmm hmm hmm hmm

15:21.254 --> 15:24.992
* Hmm hmm
hmm hmm *

15:26.593 --> 15:29.629
* Lost in a crowd

15:29.662 --> 15:33.800
* You feel your
thoughts out loud *

15:33.833 --> 15:38.071
* Lost in the wilderness
of the sound *

15:38.105 --> 15:42.409
* Get through the day,
don't drown *

15:42.442 --> 15:44.244
* Life, it goes fast

15:44.277 --> 15:46.613
* Youth is gone

15:46.646 --> 15:48.781
* Feelings of loss, come on

15:48.815 --> 15:50.917
* Grieve, move on

15:50.950 --> 15:52.785
* Stuck in the shadows

15:52.819 --> 15:55.255
* Of a lie

15:55.288 --> 15:57.324
* That you tried

15:57.357 --> 16:00.927
* To leave behind...

16:00.960 --> 16:03.096
Come on, Jamal!

16:03.130 --> 16:05.298
Come on, man,
get up onstage here.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.967
Jamal Lyon.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.976
* Sounds so good,
don't you agree? *

16:20.647 --> 16:22.782
* Yeah

16:22.815 --> 16:24.851
* No, no

16:24.884 --> 16:27.454
* Well, we travel

16:27.487 --> 16:29.456
* And we travel

16:29.489 --> 16:33.326
* Trying to find it

16:33.360 --> 16:35.862
* I know that
neither one of us *

16:35.895 --> 16:37.964
* Oh, neither one of us

16:37.997 --> 16:41.468
* Can survive it

16:41.501 --> 16:44.137
* We're just people

16:44.171 --> 16:46.473
* Lonely people

16:46.506 --> 16:51.144
* You and I

16:51.178 --> 16:52.379
* Come on

16:52.412 --> 16:53.513
* Get yo self

16:53.546 --> 16:54.647
* Get yo self

16:54.681 --> 16:55.715
* Get yo self

16:55.748 --> 16:56.816
* Get yo self

16:56.849 --> 16:58.017
* Get yo self

16:58.051 --> 17:01.321
* Get yo self together

17:01.354 --> 17:05.192
* No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no! *

17:17.270 --> 17:19.372
Hi. Come on in.

17:19.406 --> 17:22.875
Welcome to
baby wonderland.

17:22.909 --> 17:25.044
Yeah.

17:25.078 --> 17:27.347
Look, I hired
the bossest baby-proofers.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.416
No edges,
no corners, no sockets.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.451
It's like a baby wonderland now.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.888
I even got something
for the nursery.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.891
(growls)

17:40.560 --> 17:42.862
(sighs)
What are you doing, Hakeem?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.597
I'm the father.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.566
I know it's more
than buying stuff,

17:46.599 --> 17:48.268
but it's to show you
that I'm in.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.205
What about your fiancée?

17:52.239 --> 17:54.741
What about her?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.042
I love her.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.577
She loves me.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.380
And I know
she'll love the baby, too.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.714
But before I step to her,

18:01.748 --> 18:05.452
I got to make sure
we straight first.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.055
(sighs) Well, what makes you
think that I want you involved

18:09.088 --> 18:10.957
in raising our child?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.892
Anika,

18:12.925 --> 18:14.727
the one good thing
about being a Lyon--

18:14.761 --> 18:18.064
other than being
kicked up to the fullest--

18:18.097 --> 18:21.100
is that I've seen every
wrong move in raising a family,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.236
and I know what I shouldn't do.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.473
But there's a problem.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.642
Your father threatened my life
the day the baby is born.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.777
What?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.246
So forgive me if I'm not feeling

18:33.280 --> 18:34.981
the whole concept
of being a Lyon.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.752
WAITRESS: Next we have
the chocolate ganache gâteau

18:39.786 --> 18:40.920
with fresh raspberries.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.922
Enjoy.
Thank you.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.424
Well, seriously,

18:44.457 --> 18:46.092
your-your staff was telling me

18:46.125 --> 18:48.261
that this series I'm doing
on you keeps getting bigger.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
Well, if you move me
to your front page,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.665
maybe I'll give you
an exclusive.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.602
You'd make it exclusive for me,
Lucious?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.103
Exclusively yours.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.771
Hmm.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.441
Okay, well, I guess
we'll have to go front page.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.310
Mmm, my God.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.444
This woman has
a tracking device

19:04.477 --> 19:05.678
in your sack
or something.

19:05.712 --> 19:09.015
This woman got
a lot of things, honey.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.683
Ooh, it smell
fishy in here.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.819
We were eating lobster
for lunch.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.321
Mmm, I'm sure.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.623
I'm free tonight.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.124
How about I have
my dessert later?

19:18.157 --> 19:20.460
(chuckles) I'll send the car.
All right.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.863
You might want to send
some vinegar and water.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.031
I'll see you
tonight, Lucious.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.334
Why you got
to be so nasty?

19:27.367 --> 19:28.535
COOKIE:
You the one nasty.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.136
You need to
disinfect this seat.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.138
(laughs)
What?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.506
Your boy got something
really important

19:33.540 --> 19:34.874
to say to you, Lucious.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.843
So you threatened
to kill her.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.345
The mother of my child?

19:41.013 --> 19:43.015
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.152
The last I heard, you didn't
care what happened to her.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.554
Her mom's telling her
to leave New York

19:47.587 --> 19:49.322
and to get as far away
from me as possible.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.824
Oh, well,
she can't do that, Hakeem.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.827
You have rights as a father,
and we have lawyers.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.196
Hell, Thirsty's shady ass
can get that baby.

19:57.230 --> 19:58.498
Mom, stop.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.666
I'm the father.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.067
The baby's mine, okay?

20:01.100 --> 20:03.670
I want Anika to feel
safe and happy.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.538
So here's the deal:

20:05.572 --> 20:08.007
if Anika leaves,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.743
you won't see
the baby or me again.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.512
Uh, Hakeem.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.415
Hakeem.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.084
Ooh, he's upset.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.920
(chuckles)
You think it's funny, don't you?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.856
You know we need the boy
to show up to our event.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.859
Or you can get used
to answering to whitey.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.896
You know I'm sick and tired
of the way they do business.

20:29.929 --> 20:34.033
I know, so maybe
you should back off

20:34.066 --> 20:37.103
and let me handle boo boo kitty.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.372
You worry about
that-that scallop

20:39.406 --> 20:41.274
you got coming
to see you later.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.711
(sighs)

20:44.744 --> 20:47.414
I should have never went public.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.251
ANDRE:
Being here today

20:52.285 --> 20:55.288
wasn't an easy thing for me.

20:55.322 --> 20:58.891
In fact, it was terrifying.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.661
And that's exactly
why I'm doing it.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.497
Mental health is such
a shameful subject,

21:04.531 --> 21:07.099
especially for
African-American families.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.569
For years, my father
hid from that shame,

21:09.602 --> 21:11.237
because the thought
of his own mother being bipolar

21:11.270 --> 21:12.639
was more than he could bear.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.273
I feel like maybe Lucious

21:14.307 --> 21:15.908
should actually
say that second part,

21:15.942 --> 21:17.276
you know?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.745
"I hid from the shame,"

21:18.778 --> 21:20.413
therefore, it's more
of a back and forth

21:20.447 --> 21:21.748
between father and son,
you know?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.783
Got you.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.418
That's why you're here, baby.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.120
(laughter)

21:29.155 --> 21:32.425
If this gets him
reinstated as CEO,

21:32.459 --> 21:34.461
you know what that means, right?
Yes.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.162
With Jamal and Hakeem
out of the running,

21:36.195 --> 21:38.465
that leaves you solidly
in place for his number two.

21:38.498 --> 21:41.100
Mmm, just a heartbeat
away from the throne, baby.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.435
Where you always belonged.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.303
Yeah, that's right.

21:44.337 --> 21:48.174
And what about those other two
board members, the holdouts?

21:48.207 --> 21:50.777
Oh, they'll be there.
I made sure of that.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.680
Okay, good.
Cookie's arranged
for a ton of press.

21:53.713 --> 21:56.616
Everything's in position.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.050
Okay?

22:00.353 --> 22:02.355
(distant shouting, horn honking)

22:08.995 --> 22:11.364
Anika?

22:11.398 --> 22:13.332
Uh, Anika, we need to talk
about what you're doing

22:13.366 --> 22:14.367
with your baby. (gasps)

22:14.401 --> 22:16.002
Oh, no. What happened?

22:16.035 --> 22:17.169
Step aside, ma'am.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.805
Wait, is she okay?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.139
Ma'am, you need to step aside.

22:20.172 --> 22:21.474
You need to stop
telling me what to do.

22:21.508 --> 22:22.642
Is she gonna be all right?

22:22.675 --> 22:24.644
Hold up. Is she okay?
(gasps)

22:24.677 --> 22:26.646
Look, ma'am, you can
follow us to the hospital.
I'm not following.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.148
I'm riding.
That's my son's baby.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.183
(gasping)

22:37.757 --> 22:40.059
(siren wailing)

22:40.092 --> 22:41.327
Bleeding is dark red,

22:41.360 --> 22:43.830
approximately 100 to 150 cc's.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.699
No visible wounds.
BP is 104/66.

22:46.733 --> 22:48.367
Pulse, 140 beats per minute.

22:48.401 --> 22:50.002
Is she gonna be okay?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.505
Oh, my God, it hurts so bad.

22:52.539 --> 22:54.340
Ma'am, I need you to stay calm.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.708
Can you tell me
how bad the pain is?

22:57.209 --> 22:59.011
She's having
a damn panic attack.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.212
Can't you give
her something?

23:00.246 --> 23:01.380
I can give her oxygen,
that's it.

23:01.414 --> 23:03.082
Pain meds might effect the baby.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.084
No, I'm not...
Anika, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.352
Anika, listen.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.587
Listen, listen.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.189
Anika, I need you
to relax, okay?

23:10.222 --> 23:11.558
You're stressing the baby.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.059
I can't.

23:13.092 --> 23:16.429
Look, uh, I know you're scared.

23:16.463 --> 23:18.698
I need you to trust me
right now, okay?

23:18.731 --> 23:20.700
Forget everything.
Forget everything.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.535
And just listen to
the sound of my voice.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.236
Breathe.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.538
Breathe with me.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.941
Like this:
(breathing steadily)

23:28.975 --> 23:30.076
Come on.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.244
There you go.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.880
Come on, keep going.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.882
Okay, let him put that on.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.049
Keep breathing.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.752
That a girl.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.056
Yes, you're gonna
be all right.

23:44.090 --> 23:48.394
And that baby's gonna be
just fine, believe that.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.730
Thank you.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.634
Besides, Hakeem would kill me if
something happens to his baby.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.769
You mean your grandchild.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.805
(siren wailing)

24:00.172 --> 24:02.174
(R&B song playing softly)

24:12.284 --> 24:15.488
* La, la, la, la

24:15.522 --> 24:18.424
* La, la,
la, la *

24:18.457 --> 24:19.859
Mmm.

24:19.892 --> 24:23.262
(chuckles)

24:23.295 --> 24:25.998
You like that?
Uh...

24:26.032 --> 24:28.501
The Whitney's been
trying to get me

24:28.535 --> 24:31.437
to part with that
for a decade.

24:31.470 --> 24:32.805
You should donate it.

24:32.839 --> 24:36.342
Art is supposed
to be shared.

24:36.375 --> 24:40.146
Well, I share my music
and my words.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.458
Oh, I like this.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.460
(laughs)

24:54.493 --> 24:58.330
You really shut the
whole club down for me?

24:58.364 --> 25:01.467
You sure Cookie's not
gonna bust in on us?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.035
Nah.

25:03.069 --> 25:06.005
This is a place
for demons tonight.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.911
Mm-hmm.
Oh, you like it.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.647
Just show me.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.882
Gettin' rough with me?

25:15.915 --> 25:16.849
But I'm on top.

25:16.883 --> 25:17.984
You like that?

25:18.017 --> 25:18.918
Yeah, what do you think?

25:25.892 --> 25:29.361
There you are.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.529
Do you like that?

25:30.563 --> 25:31.764
Only if you mean it.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.533
Come here.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.508
Do you feel that?

25:42.541 --> 25:43.843
I see you like
to be in charge, huh?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.044
Mm-hmm.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.880
I got a job for you.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.182
(chuckles)

25:50.216 --> 25:53.119
You are blowing my mind.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.286
(laughs)

25:54.320 --> 25:56.689
(both moan)

25:56.723 --> 25:58.024
(phone ringing)

25:58.057 --> 25:59.458
Hold on.
Uh-uh.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.095
Come on, not now, Cookie.
Come on, not now.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.864
No, Cookie, damn it.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.866
I'm so sorry.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.535
(scoffs)
It's okay, Lucious, I get it.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.537
(sighs)

26:11.570 --> 26:13.239
You two have a thing.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.208
Cookie says jump,
you ask how high.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.544
Oh, it's not like that.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.046
(sighs)
It's a family emergency.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.914
I will make it up to you.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.783
We'll rain check, you know.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.553
You know,

26:27.586 --> 26:30.422
why don't I do my profile
on Cookie, instead?

26:30.456 --> 26:32.558
"Meet the Manipulative Bitch

26:32.591 --> 26:34.093
"That Has
the Mighty Lucious Lyon

26:34.126 --> 26:35.394
Wrapped around
Her Little Finger."

26:35.427 --> 26:36.562
What do you think?

26:36.595 --> 26:38.998
I think...

26:39.031 --> 26:41.067
you'd do really good

26:41.100 --> 26:43.936
not to say nothing bad
about her ever again.

26:45.772 --> 26:49.241
I'll have Thirsty send a car.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.911
HAKEEM: I get it
if you want to give it back,

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
but I wish you wouldn't.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.148
I don't know what
my options are.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.918
I mean, at this point.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.920
My options are bad, too,

27:00.953 --> 27:02.955
but you want me to
turn my back on my baby?

27:02.989 --> 27:05.291
It's not fair
to ask me that, Hakeem.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.993
I didn't create the situation.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.095
(phone ringing)
I know you didn't,

27:09.128 --> 27:12.832
but, babe, I got to step up
or I'm gonna look less of a man.

27:12.865 --> 27:14.801
And I wouldn't be worthy
of marrying you.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.937
(ringing continues)

27:17.970 --> 27:19.605
Do you think you
should get that?

27:19.638 --> 27:22.441
Nothing else matters
when I'm with you.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.111
If you're gonna raise
a child with Anika,

27:25.144 --> 27:26.645
where does that leave us?

27:26.679 --> 27:28.848
It'd be my kid.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.283
She'd be the mother,

27:31.317 --> 27:32.618
and you'll be my wife.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.321
We'll be a family.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.660
I think you and me

27:41.694 --> 27:46.665
have very different ideas
of what family means.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.038
Don't do that.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.505
It's done.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.515
(phone ringing)

28:16.295 --> 28:18.697
(elevator bell dings)
COOKIE: Hakeem.

28:18.731 --> 28:19.866
Where is she at?
Is she okay, Mom?

28:19.899 --> 28:20.900
Her mother's right there.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.005
Hi, Mrs. Calhoun,
I'm Hakeem.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.239
It's about time you showed up.

28:27.273 --> 28:28.741
Look, I came as soon as I heard.

28:28.775 --> 28:31.710
My daughter has been pregnant
for almost five months.

28:31.744 --> 28:34.680
Look, I did... I'm sorry.
Can I just go please see her?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.682
(sighs)

28:36.715 --> 28:38.184
Uh, look, he's trying
to do the right thing.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.852
Give him a chance.

28:39.886 --> 28:42.889
Your family isn't exactly known
for doing the right thing.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.424
HAKEEM: Look, Mrs. Calhoun,
I can promise you,

28:45.457 --> 28:47.526
whatever happened in the past,

28:47.559 --> 28:49.461
I'm gonna take care
of Anika and our baby.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.032
Room 348.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.266
She wants to see you.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.608
NURSE: And if you need anything,
hit that button.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.210
Thank you, Linda.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.912
Look at the
grandmas over there.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.614
Boy, shut your damn mouth.

29:08.647 --> 29:10.249
Didn't you hear the nurse?
You got to be quiet.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.084
The baby can't have
all that noise.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.586
It is kind of ironic, though.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.124
(phone chirps)

29:18.157 --> 29:21.127
Uh, Lucious is on his way.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.228
I didn't know

29:22.261 --> 29:23.462
if he'd show up.

29:23.495 --> 29:26.132
Lucious Lyon
is not welcome here.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.733
Not after what he did.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.236
Mom.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.138
What'd he do? Ma?

29:32.171 --> 29:33.272
What, boy?

29:33.305 --> 29:34.406
It's your father.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.075
What hasn't he done?

29:36.108 --> 29:37.810
Look, I'm hungry.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.612
What'd he do?

29:42.648 --> 29:44.483
(elevator bell dings)

29:48.454 --> 29:50.322
Hey, I'm looking
for Anika Calhoun's room.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.958
(clears throat)

29:56.462 --> 29:57.930
How is she?

29:57.964 --> 29:59.966
We need to talk.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.770
Look, son, I'm sorry.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.038
I'm calling off the dogs, okay?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.575
That's my little grandchild
in there.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.811
What you did to Anika's father.

30:12.845 --> 30:16.115
Having him sign those papers
so I can take my company public?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.616
Having him commit fraud?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.785
Oh, so now
you the moral compass.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.454
Just a couple months ago,

30:22.488 --> 30:24.623
you tried to take
my company from me.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.992
People do a whole
lot of stuff

30:26.025 --> 30:27.326
to gain their wealth.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.128
But you know what?

30:29.161 --> 30:31.130
I forgive you for that.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.831
I actually respect you for that.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.968
I thought you was gonna kill me.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.470
A couple times
I thought about it.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.572
If you had been
somebody else's kid, I would.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.640
(chuckles)

30:41.673 --> 30:44.543
But seein' the way

30:44.576 --> 30:47.546
you came into my office
and you stood up for your baby

30:47.579 --> 30:49.581
and your baby's mama...

30:51.683 --> 30:53.819
(sighs)

30:53.852 --> 30:56.022
...I realized I raised
you right.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.990
You understand it's about

30:58.024 --> 31:00.993
family first,
then it's kingdom.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.394
That's the thing,
the family stuff

31:02.428 --> 31:04.230
is a little messed up right now.
Let me guess,

31:04.263 --> 31:07.733
she's really
not feeling this whole

31:07.766 --> 31:10.236
addition to
the nuclear family, huh?

31:10.269 --> 31:13.539
I bet you if you and
I talked to her together,

31:13.572 --> 31:15.942
she would see things
a whole different way.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.281
All right, I'm gonna
go check on Anika.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.050
Make sure she cool.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.584
But you still can't come in.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.219
Respect that.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.755
I'll just sit back here
and make a couple phone calls.

31:29.788 --> 31:33.592
See about making sure
my grandchild and the baby mama

31:33.625 --> 31:35.394
got the best care possible.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.564
There's benefits
to being Lucious Lyon's son.

31:46.238 --> 31:50.709
Mm-mm, you sure are
a snake charmer.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.578
Speaking of which,
your little snake

31:52.611 --> 31:54.380
must have been doing
some slithering.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.415
I smell cheap perfume.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.217
That's said by a woman
that apparently

31:58.250 --> 32:00.286
has no
emotional attachment to me.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.388
Just for your information,

32:02.421 --> 32:05.624
nothing happened
between me and Harper.

32:05.657 --> 32:08.094
You know,
they got blue pills for that.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.462
Nothing to be ashamed of.

32:10.496 --> 32:11.964
The day I need one
of them blue pills

32:11.998 --> 32:14.600
is the day I'm gonna
buy the damn company.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.905
I really don't care
what did or did not happen

32:19.938 --> 32:21.807
between you and mop head.

32:21.840 --> 32:26.612
You know, truth is,

32:26.645 --> 32:28.914
she just didn't do it for me.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.750
I like a smart woman,

32:31.783 --> 32:35.121
but I like a woman
that got some hood in her.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.756
Yeah, well,
she's too skinny to be hood.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.592
You know I like a woman
that's got some curves to her.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.793
Oh, yeah?

32:41.827 --> 32:43.329
You had her.

32:43.362 --> 32:45.097
Should've kept her.

32:45.131 --> 32:47.766
Uh, if you roll your way
over here...

32:47.799 --> 32:50.102
Uh...

32:50.136 --> 32:52.104
What if I could get you

32:52.138 --> 32:54.940
an exclusive profile
in the trades?

32:54.973 --> 32:57.776
Something that could go online
as early as tomorrow morning?

32:57.809 --> 33:01.947
That would be
a really good look.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.450
Are you really talking
about scooping Harper?

33:04.483 --> 33:07.153
I mean, you got
a problem with that?

33:07.186 --> 33:08.987
I don't owe her anything,

33:09.021 --> 33:11.323
and she ain't got nothing on me.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.629
LUCIOUS:
I mean, the truth is,

33:17.663 --> 33:20.132
I wanted to put a human face
to mental illness.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.667
That's what
"Boom Boom Boom Boom"

33:21.700 --> 33:23.669
was all about for me, you know?

33:23.702 --> 33:25.804
You're gonna win
that ASA, Lucious.

33:25.837 --> 33:28.207
And that'll be great
for Empire's share price.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.043
I'm sorry for being
so bottom line about it.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.045
Uh-uh, no, you can't
apologize for that.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.480
I mean, that's the difference

33:34.513 --> 33:36.715
between me
and my other son, Jamal.

33:36.748 --> 33:38.384
I'm an artist,
but I actually care

33:38.417 --> 33:39.985
about our shareholders.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.853
Now, I'm not saying

33:41.887 --> 33:43.655
that he is any less
deserving of an ASA

33:43.689 --> 33:44.990
just because me and his mama

33:45.023 --> 33:47.059
picked all his songs
for his album.

33:47.093 --> 33:50.496
No, he's just, uh, an artist
that's still developing,

33:50.529 --> 33:51.830
which is a good thing.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.199
A really good thing.
Nice.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.169
Jamal, we was just
talking about you.
Yeah.

33:57.203 --> 33:59.004
So this is what
we're gonna do, Dad?

33:59.037 --> 34:00.506
For an award?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.908
I came here to support
you and Dre.

34:02.941 --> 34:05.344
Relax, man, I'm just doing
a little business here.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.113
I don't like the way
that you do business.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.716
It's not right.

34:10.749 --> 34:12.017
Jamal.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.185
No, it's cool.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.353
I wouldn't perform here
if you paid me.

34:14.386 --> 34:17.022
I'm out.
Jamal.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.357
You bastard.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.592
Letting another publication
scoop me?

34:20.626 --> 34:22.394
And you knew that
that would make

34:22.428 --> 34:25.030
my big Lucious Lyon
exclusive useless.

34:25.063 --> 34:29.201
I didn't know anything,
sweetheart, but...

34:29.235 --> 34:31.870
(chuckles)
I like to share my stories.

34:31.903 --> 34:33.939
Mm-hmm.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.976
I'll see you later.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.079
No love?

34:47.819 --> 34:50.222
Andre, just the man
I was looking for.

34:50.256 --> 34:51.923
I have something I think

34:51.957 --> 34:53.225
that might interest you.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.626
Um, it's not really a good time.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.094
I'm about to go onstage
with my father.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.070
What is this?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.072
It's a group home
outside of Philadelphia.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.807
This couple

35:08.840 --> 35:10.075
collects money from the state

35:10.108 --> 35:13.011
to take care
of ten mentally ill adults.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.249
Keep going.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.318
That woman's name
is Leah Walker.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.323
I believe
she's your grandmother.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.528
You can keep the pictures.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.663
Hey.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.932
What's going on?
You okay?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.134
Um...

35:36.168 --> 35:37.436
I have to go.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.804
Go?

35:38.837 --> 35:40.138
Go where, babe?

35:48.814 --> 35:51.016
LAURA: Hi.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.353
Laura, what are
you doing here?

35:54.386 --> 35:56.955
Your dad called me.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.291
He said he had Anika moved
to a nicer room

35:59.325 --> 36:02.461
and that you're really
taking care of her.

36:02.494 --> 36:05.163
He said you're becoming
a man he respects.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.832
My dad said that?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.971
Is she gonna be okay?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.873
Yeah, she's doing better.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.376
They say she should be
able to leave tomorrow.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.819
I've been carrying this ring
ever since you took it off.

36:27.853 --> 36:31.390
I was hoping

36:31.423 --> 36:34.926
maybe you could see things
the way I see them.

36:56.582 --> 36:59.585
(indistinct conversation)

37:02.554 --> 37:05.056
(crowd cheering)

37:05.090 --> 37:07.526
Freda, what you doing here?

37:07.559 --> 37:09.861
What up?
What you do...
What you doing here?

37:09.895 --> 37:11.863
I seen your post on Hakeem's
app, thought I'd come through.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.533
That's so dope, come on.
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.867
What's up, y'all?
How y'all doin'?

37:15.901 --> 37:17.736
That is so dope,
you came through?

37:17.769 --> 37:20.906
Yeah, man, had to, man.

37:20.939 --> 37:22.107
(chuckles)

37:22.140 --> 37:24.042
Amen. That's-that's right.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.043
You see, Empire

37:25.076 --> 37:26.945
is a family brand.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.213
And together,

37:28.246 --> 37:30.616
we're taking that brand
into the future.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.718
Together, we've faced
many obstacles

37:32.751 --> 37:34.553
and overcome many challenges;

37:34.586 --> 37:36.822
that's made us
stronger than ever.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.089
Yes.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.394
Where are your sons tonight?

37:42.428 --> 37:45.431
This doesn't really seem
like much of a family.

37:46.765 --> 37:48.233
COOKIE: Uh, you want
to hear about family?

37:48.266 --> 37:51.069
Well, I will tell you
about family.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.571
Ladies and gentleman,

37:52.604 --> 37:54.306
I have an amazing announcement

37:54.340 --> 37:55.407
for you tonight.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.609
For the first time ever,

37:57.643 --> 38:00.412
the Lyon family
will be performing

38:00.446 --> 38:03.248
at this year's ASA awards.

38:03.281 --> 38:06.251
The Empire presents

38:06.284 --> 38:08.420
the first
family of music.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.989
Hakeem, Jamal, and Lucious Lyon,

38:11.022 --> 38:12.424
all on the same stage

38:12.458 --> 38:13.925
at the same damn time.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.761
How about that?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.329
Ain't that something?
Yes.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.631
Is that really gonna happen?
Yes, even if I have

38:19.665 --> 38:21.166
to get a strap

38:21.199 --> 38:23.802
and strangle
you all to behave.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.606
MAN:
The ASAs wanted him,

38:27.639 --> 38:28.874
but we got him.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.308
Ladies and gentleman,

38:30.342 --> 38:32.944
let's give a warm
round of applause

38:32.978 --> 38:35.614
for Jamal Lyon.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.416
(applause and cheering)

38:39.985 --> 38:41.620
BECKY:
Get 'em, Mal!

38:41.653 --> 38:43.288
Okay, Mal!

38:43.321 --> 38:46.091
That's right, Jamal!

38:52.398 --> 38:54.666
Hey!

38:55.667 --> 38:57.202
(funk song begins)

38:57.235 --> 39:00.806
* I just wanna be good enough

39:00.839 --> 39:04.676
* I just wanna
be good enough for ya *

39:08.680 --> 39:10.849
* I give you all of me

39:10.882 --> 39:14.152
* But it still ain't enough
to make you happy *

39:14.185 --> 39:16.522
* I give you everything

39:16.555 --> 39:18.189
* And still don't measure up

39:18.223 --> 39:19.725
* No

39:19.758 --> 39:21.660
* Feels like
I walked 5,000 miles *

39:21.693 --> 39:23.862
* Didn't even come close

39:23.895 --> 39:25.330
* No, no *

39:25.363 --> 39:26.998
* Feels like I try
to make you smile *

39:27.032 --> 39:30.335
* You don't even care, no, no

39:30.368 --> 39:33.071
* I'll never be big enough

39:33.104 --> 39:34.740
* To pay your dues

39:34.773 --> 39:36.875
* But I keep trying

39:36.908 --> 39:40.345
* You just keep making me
jump through hoops *

39:40.378 --> 39:43.081
* What do I got to do, oh

39:43.114 --> 39:45.250
* I just want you
to look at me *

39:45.283 --> 39:48.754
* To see that I can be
worth your love *

39:48.787 --> 39:51.189
* I just want you
to look at me *

39:51.222 --> 39:53.224
* And see that I can be

39:53.258 --> 39:56.361
* Good enough, good enough

39:56.394 --> 39:58.263
* I just want to be
good enough for you, baby *

39:58.296 --> 40:00.365
* Good enough

40:00.398 --> 40:03.569
* Good enough, yeah

40:03.602 --> 40:06.538
* I try to be good enough

40:06.572 --> 40:08.707
* I try to be
good enough *

40:08.740 --> 40:10.375
* For you, baby

40:10.408 --> 40:14.212
* Try, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

40:14.245 --> 40:16.414
* I try to show you
that I'm strong *

40:16.448 --> 40:19.585
* Why do I even bother?

40:19.618 --> 40:22.220
* 'Cause it's
the same ol' damn song *

40:22.253 --> 40:25.123
* You call yourself
a father, whoa *

40:25.156 --> 40:26.758
* Feels like I'm reaching
for the stars *

40:26.792 --> 40:29.294
* But heaven isn't letting me

40:29.327 --> 40:32.764
* I wish that
I had longer arms *

40:32.798 --> 40:34.600
* But I know
that I will never be *

40:34.633 --> 40:36.401
* Never be...

40:36.434 --> 40:37.803
REPORTER:
With a spectacular,

40:37.836 --> 40:40.572
unscheduled pre-ASA
performance underway,

40:40.606 --> 40:42.741
Jamal Lyon is proving
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

40:42.774 --> 40:45.076
that he's a contender.

40:45.110 --> 40:46.578
And if you can see
behind me here,

40:46.612 --> 40:48.914
these people have been
waiting to get inside.

40:48.947 --> 40:53.118
* Said it doesn't matter what
you think, I'm still a man *

40:53.151 --> 40:55.921
* Open up your eyes

40:55.954 --> 40:59.090
* Can't you see
that I'm good enough... *

40:59.124 --> 41:01.760
* I just want you
to look at me *

41:01.793 --> 41:04.663
* To see that I could
be worth your love *

41:04.696 --> 41:07.165
* I just want you
to look at me *

41:07.198 --> 41:10.435
* To see that I can be,
yeah, so good *

41:10.468 --> 41:14.506
* Good enou-no-no-nough

41:14.540 --> 41:19.444
* Oh, good enough

41:19.477 --> 41:21.847
* Oh, no.

41:21.880 --> 41:25.483
(applause)

41:25.517 --> 41:27.485
Fantastic Negrito.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.358
*

41:34.860 --> 41:36.294
Congratulations, you two.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.196
We just heard
you've raised a record

41:38.229 --> 41:40.298
amount of money
tonight for NABD.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.800
And, Cookie,

41:41.833 --> 41:43.034
that vision you laid out

41:43.068 --> 41:44.670
of the Lyon family presenting

41:44.703 --> 41:47.739
and performing at the ASAs...
Oh, genius.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.140
Thank you.
It's just what we need

41:49.174 --> 41:50.475
to reposition Empire

41:50.508 --> 41:53.478
and get Wall Street re-excited
about the company.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.647
Yeah.
Well, that's
exactly why we did it.

41:55.681 --> 41:57.348
You know, Lucious,

41:57.382 --> 41:58.817
the board had been looking

41:58.850 --> 42:00.719
at an outside candidate for CEO,

42:00.752 --> 42:02.520
but we're now unanimous

42:02.554 --> 42:04.155
in our thinking
that it should be...

42:04.189 --> 42:07.225
Well, before you go any further,
I just want to say,

42:07.258 --> 42:10.361
without the help of Cookie Lyon,
my number one,

42:10.395 --> 42:12.330
this would not
have been possible.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.565
That's just what
we were getting to.

42:13.599 --> 42:15.867
Considering
the fact the two of you

42:15.901 --> 42:17.402
co-founded Empire

42:17.435 --> 42:19.504
and now continue
to work together so well,

42:19.537 --> 42:21.506
the board would
like you to come on

42:21.539 --> 42:23.775
as co-CEOs.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.678
Co-CEO? (laughs)

42:26.712 --> 42:27.713
Control of Empire

42:27.746 --> 42:29.080
would be split
down the middle,

42:29.114 --> 42:31.216
between the two of you.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.254
Uh, that-that-that-that's
a great proposition,

42:36.287 --> 42:37.388
but I think, um,

42:37.422 --> 42:38.590
Lucious and I,

42:38.624 --> 42:40.525
we would have
to discuss the details.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.360
Nah, no, no,
there's nothing to discuss.

42:42.393 --> 42:43.729
Um...

42:43.762 --> 42:45.831
Um...

42:47.899 --> 42:50.201
I think it's a fantastic idea.

42:50.235 --> 42:51.703
I'm so glad to hear
you say that.
Congratulations.

42:51.737 --> 42:52.738
Thank you.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.239
That's wonderful.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.540
Take care.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.242
Congratulations.
Take care.

42:58.276 --> 42:59.444
You do?

42:59.477 --> 43:01.379
I mean, you and me finally

43:01.412 --> 43:04.082
working together, side by side.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.984
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

43:07.085 --> 43:08.419
Congratulations, baby.

43:08.453 --> 43:09.721
Thank you.

43:09.755 --> 43:10.889
(laughs)

43:10.922 --> 43:12.123
(laughs)

43:14.492 --> 43:16.494
I got your back.

43:53.832 --> 43:54.933
Yeah.
