08:35.078 --> 08:36.683
I have some great news!

08:36.725 --> 08:37.871
Tony lost his hand

08:37.873 --> 08:39.019
in the bowling ball return?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.085
No, Emma

08:42.086 --> 08:43.482
uploaded the video

08:43.523 --> 08:44.691
of your angry song

08:44.692 --> 08:45.859
about Tony

08:43.523 --> 08:45.859
on Kitty Couture!

08:45.901 --> 08:48.175
What? You posted

08:48.176 --> 08:50.448
my pain on the Internet

08:45.901 --> 08:50.448
for everyone to see?

08:50.489 --> 08:52.074
That is unforgivable!

08:52.116 --> 08:53.826
But everyone loves it!

08:53.827 --> 08:55.535
Your song is a huge hit!

08:55.577 --> 08:56.578
And you're forgiven!

08:58.330 --> 08:59.686
Remember, never ever

08:59.687 --> 09:01.041
let your guard down,

09:01.083 --> 09:03.283

09:10.177 --> 09:11.469
a full 11 years.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.431
- Perhaps I shall be
- reincarnated as a doormat.

09:13.471 --> 09:15.307
That way I can cut out

09:15.308 --> 09:17.141
the middle man.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.789
Okay, who wants

09:18.790 --> 09:20.394
to make a Ravi kebab?

09:20.436 --> 09:21.583
Oh! I'll do it,

09:21.584 --> 09:22.729
Coach Penny!

09:22.771 --> 09:24.002
I am to be felled

09:24.003 --> 09:25.232

09:40.061 --> 09:41.415
pounding their hands

09:38.703 --> 09:41.415
together like that?

09:41.457 --> 09:43.417
- Are they warming up
- their fist to punch me?

09:45.002 --> 09:46.254
No. Ravi, they're

09:46.255 --> 09:47.505
clapping for you!

09:47.546 --> 09:48.673
Huh! I did not

09:48.674 --> 09:49.798
see this coming.

09:49.840 --> 09:50.925
Ravi Ross

09:50.926 --> 09:52.009
is the winner!

09:54.970 --> 09:56.930
I won?

09:56.972 --> 09:58.307
- I won!
- I am so macho!

- Didn't you answer?

- Oh! Oh, what,
- just 'cause you're a man,

- I have to be at your

No!

Yes?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.125
- To be honest, - I don't know what
- "beck and call" means.

What do you mean?

10:48.629 --> 10:49.649
It's today.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.794
- It was exactly one year ago
- we kissed in that teacup.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.658
- Here's the citation
- we got for trespassing.

10:54.863 --> 10:55.906

11:01.955 --> 11:03.288

Why would I be

11:04.645 --> 11:05.957
mad for a little

11:03.330 --> 11:05.957
thing like that?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.101
- (CHUCKLES)
- That would be crazy.

Oh, Tony,

11:20.974 --> 11:22.682
that's so thoughtful.

11:22.724 --> 11:23.997
And not at all

11:23.998 --> 11:25.269
"Callous and mean,

11:22.724 --> 11:25.269
like a love-killing machine."

11:30.690 --> 11:31.880
Jessie! The director

11:31.881 --> 11:33.068
of Estro-Palooza emailed me!

11:33.110 --> 11:34.986
She loves your song!

11:35.028 --> 11:36.738
(GASPS) That's amazing!

11:36.780 --> 11:38.258
- Even better, - she wants you
- To perform it tonight!

11:38.282 --> 11:41.619
(GASPS) That's horrible.

11:57.677 --> 11:59.678
just melting away.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.765
Emma, I can't do it.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.517
- I'm the one who forgot
- our anniversary.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.915
I can't sing that

12:06.916 --> 12:08.270
mean song ever again.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.417
But this festival

12:09.418 --> 12:10.522
is a huge deal!

12:10.564 --> 12:12.542
- A bunch of big-time - artists have been
- Discovered there.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.858
You could be next!

12:13.900 --> 12:15.194
(SIGHS) So, let me

12:15.195 --> 12:16.487
get this straight,

12:16.528 --> 12:18.155
- in order to get
- my big break,

12:18.196 --> 12:19.197
I have to publicly

12:19.198 --> 12:20.198
trash my boyfriend

12:20.240 --> 12:21.968
- at a concert - he's taking me to
- For our anniversary?

12:21.992 --> 12:24.536
What am I gonna do?

12:24.578 --> 12:25.870
Stress doll?

12:32.336 --> 12:33.963
Okay, I'll distract Tony

12:33.964 --> 12:35.589
while you and Zuri sneak

12:32.336 --> 12:35.589
down to the park.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.442
- After you perform, - I'll tell him
- There was a mix-up

12:37.466 --> 12:38.530
And he was supposed

12:38.531 --> 12:39.593
to meet you down there.

12:39.635 --> 12:40.908
(SIGHS) I can't believe

12:40.909 --> 12:42.179
I'm really doing this.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.096
- My stomach hasn't been - this upset
since I won - The T-Bone Challenge

12:43.138 --> 12:45.307
At Sir Loins-A-Lot.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.230
Tony! My favorite pair

12:51.231 --> 12:52.939
of high heels is missing!

12:52.981 --> 12:54.250
- We have to look - through the security
- Camera footage

12:54.274 --> 12:55.900
- Until we find
- that couture klepto.

12:55.942 --> 12:56.943
Aw, man. Jessie and I

12:56.944 --> 12:57.944
are about to go out

12:57.986 --> 12:59.343
on our date. Can't it wait

12:59.344 --> 13:00.698
until tomorrow?

13:00.739 --> 13:01.824
Imagine if someone

13:01.825 --> 13:02.907
stole your hair gel!

13:02.949 --> 13:04.789
- Whoa! I didn't realize
- it was that serious.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.000
What are you doing?

13:12.042 --> 13:14.190
I just organized all

13:14.191 --> 13:16.338
my utensils by first name!

13:16.380 --> 13:18.507
I mean, the normal

13:18.508 --> 13:20.634
not-weird way.

13:20.676 --> 13:21.928
(SIGHS) Ravi and I

13:21.929 --> 13:23.178
are supposed to practice

13:20.676 --> 13:23.178
our fencing for school,

13:23.220 --> 13:25.055
- and I need a place
- to stash this.

13:25.096 --> 13:27.056
- He's been unbearable
- ever since I let him win.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.019
Oh, there you are, Luke.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.187
I thought you might

13:32.188 --> 13:33.313
have absconded

13:31.061 --> 13:33.313
with our equipment.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.899
I do not blame you.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.505
If I had to fence me,

13:37.506 --> 13:39.069
I would be scared

13:35.940 --> 13:39.069
like a little girl, too.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.741
I'm not scared of you.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.242
- And neither
- are little girls.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.371
And, FYI, you didn't beat me.

13:49.413 --> 13:51.039
I let you win!

13:51.081 --> 13:54.209
(LAUGHS) Oh, Luke.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.232
Poor, simple,

13:56.233 --> 13:58.213
bad-at-fencing Luke.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.091

14:00.092 --> 14:01.925
can beat me at anything

14:01.966 --> 14:03.051
Or fencing!

14:05.721 --> 14:07.244
Well, it appears

14:07.245 --> 14:08.766
there is only one way

14:05.721 --> 14:08.766
to settle this!

14:10.684 --> 14:12.060

- dropped them.
