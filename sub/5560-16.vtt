00:01.577 --> 00:03.860
Previously on "Blindspot"...

00:06.524 --> 00:08.249
I think Jane Doe is Taylor Shaw.

00:08.251 --> 00:10.763
Taylor Shaw has been missing for 25 years.

00:10.765 --> 00:12.558
Yeah, and she's not missing anymore.

00:12.560 --> 00:16.260
I had your DNA tested to
see if it matched Taylor's.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.407
You have the results?

00:17.438 --> 00:18.932
You are Taylor Shaw.

00:18.972 --> 00:23.431
You spent 25 years convinced Dad committed
a murder that never even happened.

00:23.531 --> 00:24.865
She's alive, Kurt.

00:24.943 --> 00:26.320
Then why did you lie?

00:26.367 --> 00:27.432
About where you were. Why did you...

00:27.479 --> 00:30.337
Because I was trying to kill myself!

00:30.398 --> 00:33.360
Stop looking into Tom
Carter's disappearance,

00:33.413 --> 00:36.813
or people you love will start to die.

00:36.901 --> 00:38.198
I can't do this anymore.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.094
- What?
- I don't feel the same way.

00:40.148 --> 00:42.953
- I know that you love me.
- No... I don't.

00:43.018 --> 00:44.292
What if I didn't notice?

00:44.373 --> 00:45.502
I knew you would.

00:45.574 --> 00:48.356
Our timing is... is just off.

00:48.396 --> 00:52.663
I wasted so much energy
on why it wouldn't work.

00:52.665 --> 00:53.767
I loved him.

00:53.775 --> 00:55.549
And now he's gone.

00:55.551 --> 00:58.969
You always act like everything's
going completely according to plan.

00:59.065 --> 01:00.504
Things are back on track.

01:00.552 --> 01:01.934
So what now?

02:19.042 --> 02:21.918
Sarah, it's me.

02:21.977 --> 02:23.046
What's going on?

02:23.100 --> 02:24.971
Give me a call when you get this.

02:32.144 --> 02:33.275
Hello?

02:33.331 --> 02:34.581
<i>This is Bacchus confirming</i>

02:34.669 --> 02:38.151
<i>your reservation tonight at
8:00 p.m. for two people.</i>

02:38.153 --> 02:39.994
Oh. Sorry, I...

02:39.996 --> 02:42.105
I don't have a reservation for tonight.

02:42.180 --> 02:44.193
<i>Booked under David Wagner?</i>

02:44.195 --> 02:47.911
<i>He gave very specific
instructions to call this number.</i>

02:52.534 --> 02:54.284
Uh...

02:54.409 --> 02:55.570
Wh-When did he...

02:55.642 --> 02:58.024
He made the reservation last month.

03:01.676 --> 03:03.262
Uh, s...

03:03.470 --> 03:05.220
Sorry, I... I have to go.

03:15.941 --> 03:17.858
All right.

03:17.860 --> 03:19.142
Step in.

03:23.616 --> 03:25.365
Thanks, man.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.787
You talk to Sarah today?

03:31.907 --> 03:33.123
Nope.

03:34.993 --> 03:36.326
She's moving out.

03:38.095 --> 03:39.595
Any idea why?

03:41.383 --> 03:42.966
Something going on with you guys?

03:45.170 --> 03:47.170
It's...

03:47.336 --> 03:49.086
We broke up.

03:50.809 --> 03:51.842
When?

03:54.513 --> 03:56.802
Last night.

03:56.849 --> 03:57.981
What happened?

04:05.073 --> 04:06.327
Doesn't matter what happened.

04:06.397 --> 04:07.686
We're not dating anymore.

04:07.764 --> 04:09.667
You should be happy.

04:09.790 --> 04:10.971
Agh!

04:13.866 --> 04:16.700
I'm not happy 'cause she's not happy.

04:16.702 --> 04:18.550
Come on.

04:18.664 --> 04:20.120
I really can't win with you, man.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.839
I really can't.

04:31.049 --> 04:32.466
Mornin', Jane.

04:32.642 --> 04:34.217
Oh, hey, mornin'.

04:34.406 --> 04:36.092
Happy birthday.

04:36.318 --> 04:36.999
What?

04:37.062 --> 04:39.855
It's yours... Taylor's, birthday, today.

04:39.957 --> 04:42.809
Oh, I... I didn't even...

04:42.888 --> 04:44.271
Here.

04:45.364 --> 04:47.481
I got you something.

04:47.483 --> 04:49.247
Just the person I was looking for.

04:49.310 --> 04:50.283
Morning.

04:50.285 --> 04:51.992
- Hey, Jane.
- Allie.

04:52.053 --> 04:52.855
What are you doing here?

04:52.917 --> 04:55.960
Uh, O.P.M. briefing upstairs, so
I thought I'd stop in on my way.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.041
I can come back later if you guys
are in the middle of something.

04:58.043 --> 05:00.327
No. No, no, no. I-I have to go.

05:03.202 --> 05:04.851
This is a nice surprise.

05:04.898 --> 05:06.216
I brought you breakfast.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.765
Poppy seed muffin and cortado,
just the way you like it.

05:08.872 --> 05:09.813
It better be.

05:12.132 --> 05:14.380
- Are you coming over again tonight?
- Yes.

05:14.451 --> 05:17.302
I was, uh, thinking about
being ambitious and cooking.

05:17.356 --> 05:18.478
Wh-Whoa.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.846
Really?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.765
After last time?

05:21.958 --> 05:24.484
That fire was not entirely my fault.

05:24.486 --> 05:26.403
Someone got me a little distracted.

05:26.405 --> 05:28.755
Yeah! You were trying to heat up a pizza

05:28.826 --> 05:31.066
inside the box inside an oven.

05:31.144 --> 05:33.521
Okay, maybe you should
be in charge of the food.

05:33.552 --> 05:34.540
Good.

05:34.603 --> 05:35.695
I'll do that.

05:35.697 --> 05:38.291
All right, so, um, see you at eight?

05:38.354 --> 05:39.916
Okay.

05:40.983 --> 05:42.232
Bye.

05:43.048 --> 05:44.871
- Bye.
- Yeah.

05:47.759 --> 05:49.793
Morning, you're just in time.

05:49.795 --> 05:51.678
What do we got?

05:51.680 --> 05:55.131
Uh, an armored truck was robbed.

05:55.133 --> 05:56.216
And?

05:58.687 --> 06:01.471
Yes, um, the truck.

06:01.473 --> 06:05.493
It happened this morning in Rockland, or...

06:05.563 --> 06:07.394
- No, that's not it.
- Westchester County.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.169
It was Westchester County.

06:09.224 --> 06:10.426
Tattoo connections?

06:10.473 --> 06:12.496
Yes, yes, definitely connected.

06:12.550 --> 06:15.035
That is an affirmative, um...

06:15.037 --> 06:18.078
These are cell phone photos
from the state troopers.

06:18.196 --> 06:22.406
They said that the truck was
ambushed by heavily armed gunmen.

06:22.461 --> 06:24.494
The driver and a guard were killed.

06:24.496 --> 06:26.358
Which tattoo is this connected to?

06:26.412 --> 06:29.953
So this... square and diamond design

06:30.015 --> 06:33.236
is an exact match with the truck logo.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.721
And I couldn't figure it out,

06:34.723 --> 06:36.080
but the symmetry of it made me think

06:36.135 --> 06:38.109
of mirror images, which
led to geometric shapes...

06:38.171 --> 06:39.633
Can we get back to the robbery?

06:39.695 --> 06:41.113
Hold on a second, I want
to hear how she cracked it.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.897
It might inform the case.

06:43.899 --> 06:45.886
Well, it didn't really lead anywhere,

06:45.966 --> 06:47.737
but that's for a reason.

06:47.791 --> 06:51.521
So this logo was created for
a company that doesn't exist.

06:51.523 --> 06:52.664
What do you mean it doesn't exist?

06:52.711 --> 06:56.276
R.O.R. Security isn't registered with
the DOT or anywhere, for that matter.

06:56.278 --> 06:57.634
But if the truck wasn't registered,

06:57.704 --> 07:00.030
we have no way of knowing
what they were transporting.

07:00.032 --> 07:02.176
Clearly something valuable
enough you need an armored truck.

07:02.287 --> 07:03.750
And worth killing for.

07:03.822 --> 07:06.786
Question is, is what was inside that truck?

07:23.646 --> 07:25.168
Second set of tire marks.

07:25.215 --> 07:27.057
SUVs, judging from their size.

07:27.059 --> 07:29.476
They converged on the
truck, ran it off the road.

07:29.478 --> 07:31.728
These doors were melted open.

07:31.730 --> 07:34.346
A torch or a thermal lance.

07:34.408 --> 07:36.366
No signs of what they were moving.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.064
Guard got shot here trying to escape.

07:38.127 --> 07:39.415
He didn't stand much of a chance.

07:39.486 --> 07:41.384
These guys used armor-piercing bullets.

07:41.446 --> 07:42.794
The driver didn't even
make it out of the truck

07:42.884 --> 07:44.504
before he was shot through the window.

07:44.567 --> 07:47.293
Excuse me. Got something you need to see.

07:55.087 --> 07:56.803
So there were three guys in the truck.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.222
Check that out.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.209
"Atropine and pralidoxime...

08:07.271 --> 08:09.265
for use in nerve agent poisoning."

08:09.267 --> 08:10.900
It's the antidote for sarin gas.

08:10.902 --> 08:13.353
So they were transporting chemical weapons.

08:21.216 --> 08:26.216
Sync and corrections by explosiveskull
www.addic7ed.com

08:31.676 --> 08:34.712
Patterson... any idea
where the sarin came from?

08:34.714 --> 08:38.024
The USA CMA is located just 15 miles away.

08:38.110 --> 08:39.464
<i>Doubt that's a coincidence.</i>

08:39.525 --> 08:40.751
What-What is that?

08:40.753 --> 08:43.419
The United States Army
Chemical Materials Agency.

08:43.422 --> 08:46.223
They store and destroy all
of our chemical weapons.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.424
Who's in charge there?

08:47.426 --> 08:49.260
General Mark Sheridan.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.262
Mayfair's reaching out
to his office right now.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.147
You got anything on the victims?

08:53.149 --> 08:56.600
Yoo Jin Lee, Young Park, and Min Ha Cho.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.853
All South Korean Nationals,
clean criminal records.

08:59.962 --> 09:02.000
- Did they work at the CMA?
- <i>No.</i>

09:02.063 --> 09:03.774
So where did they get sarin from?

09:03.776 --> 09:04.909
I don't know yet.

09:04.911 --> 09:08.913
I'm building out the Koreans'
known associates here and abroad.

09:08.915 --> 09:11.081
How'd they get in the country?

09:11.083 --> 09:12.616
It was all above board.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.851
They had work visas
sponsored by the president

09:14.906 --> 09:18.122
of an import/export
company based in Brooklyn.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.924
Vanessa Chang.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.781
Bring her in. We're on our way back now.

09:33.356 --> 09:37.191
Taylor would have been 30 today.

09:37.193 --> 09:40.376
Not a day goes by that
I don't think of her.

09:40.470 --> 09:43.941
Imagine the beautiful
woman she would have become.

09:44.034 --> 09:45.566
Jane. Jane!

09:45.568 --> 09:47.401
You coming?

09:51.324 --> 09:53.857
How could this happen?

09:53.904 --> 09:56.578
If they're in possession of sarin gas,

09:56.618 --> 09:58.746
it didn't come from our facility.

09:58.748 --> 10:00.551
The only time those canisters are moved

10:00.605 --> 10:02.583
is when they're taken to be incinerated.

10:02.585 --> 10:05.386
Even then, we've got a strict
multi-level security protocol

10:05.388 --> 10:07.588
in place to prevent tampering and theft.

10:09.558 --> 10:12.032
Oh, my God. What happened?

10:12.086 --> 10:15.679
It's still an open investigation, so
we're not at liberty to discuss details.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.772
Did you... know them well?

10:17.843 --> 10:19.850
I thought I did.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.015
I sponsored their work
visas three years ago.

10:22.077 --> 10:24.271
I gave them jobs as
drivers with my company.

10:24.273 --> 10:26.357
So it could have been
one of your employees.

10:26.450 --> 10:27.858
I seriously doubt it.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.071
We're gonna have to question
everyone who had access

10:30.141 --> 10:32.196
to the sarin in the last two years.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.364
Of course.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.833
A month ago, I found out that Young

10:35.835 --> 10:39.536
was stealing antiques from my
warehouse and reselling them.

10:39.538 --> 10:42.089
I tried to get to the
bottom of it and discovered

10:42.091 --> 10:45.083
that Jin and Min Ha were also involved.

10:45.169 --> 10:46.307
You must have done background checks

10:46.361 --> 10:49.179
before you sponsored them...
any red flags come up?

10:49.181 --> 10:51.632
Nothing at the time, but
I started asking around

10:51.634 --> 10:54.435
and I heard a rumor that Yoo Jin had ties

10:54.437 --> 10:55.619
to a Korean gang.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.473
How bad is sarin?

10:57.559 --> 11:01.544
To be blunt, it melts your
organs while you asphyxiate.

11:01.622 --> 11:04.561
Looks like you've been having
some trouble with the IRS.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.530
If you're insinuating that I'm involved

11:06.532 --> 11:08.282
in some illegal activity...

11:08.284 --> 11:10.451
We're not insinuating anything.

11:10.453 --> 11:12.403
Just trying to get the full story.

11:12.405 --> 11:16.040
My father came to this country
with $200 in his pocket.

11:16.042 --> 11:19.235
He worked day and night to build
a life for me and my brothers.

11:19.298 --> 11:20.828
Money makes people do crazy things,

11:20.830 --> 11:23.163
especially when their
back's against the wall.

11:23.165 --> 11:26.550
I would never do anything
to jeopardize my reputation

11:26.552 --> 11:28.752
or my family.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.305
If those guys have a truckload of it,

11:31.307 --> 11:33.424
could wipe out the whole state.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.062
What's the update?

11:38.064 --> 11:39.730
I think I got something.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.899
All three of the Koreans
turned off their phones

11:41.901 --> 11:44.935
at the same time, about 20
minutes before the robbery.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.688
Probably so they couldn't be
detected transporting the sarin.

11:47.690 --> 11:50.157
My vector search found a known associate

11:50.159 --> 11:53.494
who turned off his cell
phone at the exact same time.

11:53.496 --> 11:55.946
Sam Lee, born and raised in Queens.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.248
Now it's starting to
look like a four-man crew.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.117
Except there's no fourth body.

12:00.119 --> 12:02.716
Welll, he could have been
working for the other team.

12:02.732 --> 12:05.205
Do you really think he was
actually on side with the robbers?

12:05.207 --> 12:06.623
He might be their inside man.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.292
Makes sense... the heist team would know

12:08.294 --> 12:10.094
when and where to strike.

12:10.096 --> 12:12.129
The driver was shot at
close range, wasn't he?

12:12.131 --> 12:13.847
Yeah, through the passenger window.

12:13.849 --> 12:15.716
Or, from inside the cab.

12:20.139 --> 12:22.564
We need to find this Sam Lee now.

12:22.642 --> 12:26.000
Okay, his cell phone's turned off,
but I have an address in K-town.

12:26.063 --> 12:27.811
- Okay.
- Hang on!

12:28.981 --> 12:31.049
Sarin gas antidotes.

12:31.104 --> 12:33.713
God forbid you need them,
but if you get exposed,

12:33.767 --> 12:35.605
you inject yourself immediately.

12:35.667 --> 12:38.205
Internal organ failure
happens within a minute.

12:38.207 --> 12:39.823
It's not pretty.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.670
Okay. Let's move. Thank you.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.656
1-5-7,
unit 5.

12:52.726 --> 12:54.063
Fifth floor.

12:54.139 --> 12:57.080
Always got to be a walk-up.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.144
Hey... there he is. That's Sam.

13:12.408 --> 13:13.690
It's no good for me, I got no shot!

13:13.692 --> 13:14.942
Me, either!

13:19.198 --> 13:21.415
Go! Down, down, down! Go!

13:21.417 --> 13:22.916
Hostage clear!

13:22.918 --> 13:24.835
NYPD is on the way.

13:24.837 --> 13:25.869
Nice shot.

13:31.043 --> 13:32.342
Sam Lee.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.801
Looks like some kind
of security access card.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.495
I don't think his building has a garage.

13:37.542 --> 13:39.466
It might be where they're
keeping the canisters.

13:39.468 --> 13:41.602
12 missed calls from the same number.

13:41.604 --> 13:43.517
Let's see who's so desperate to talk.

13:46.395 --> 13:47.391
<i>Sam?</i>

13:47.766 --> 13:50.016
Why haven't you picked up your phone?

13:51.780 --> 13:52.946
Sam?

13:52.948 --> 13:54.064
<i>Sam?</i>

13:59.205 --> 14:00.737
The General.

14:11.898 --> 14:16.152
Today would have been my
one-year anniversary with David.

14:16.154 --> 14:18.573
And I've been trying to block it out,

14:18.700 --> 14:21.329
until I got a call from
our favorite restaurant

14:21.360 --> 14:22.942
this morning...

14:22.944 --> 14:26.195
confirming a table for tonight.

14:26.197 --> 14:27.715
So David must have booked it.

14:27.762 --> 14:29.054
I see.

14:29.132 --> 14:31.884
And on top of that, the "Times" published

14:31.886 --> 14:33.581
his last crossword puzzle today,

14:33.636 --> 14:35.529
so I feel like I keep getting

14:35.568 --> 14:37.451
these messages from him,
and I know it sounds...

14:37.505 --> 14:38.791
I think you should go.

14:40.211 --> 14:41.167
What?

14:41.206 --> 14:42.216
To the dinner.

14:42.263 --> 14:44.130
I think you should go.

14:44.132 --> 14:45.768
Instead of trying to
bury yourself in your work

14:45.792 --> 14:47.459
and forget about David,
why don't you take the night

14:47.498 --> 14:49.084
to celebrate him?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.473
Go to that restaurant,
have a glass of wine,

14:51.475 --> 14:52.972
toast David and all the wonderful memories

14:52.974 --> 14:54.106
you had with him.

14:56.110 --> 14:58.611
I... I don't know. That just seems...

15:00.731 --> 15:03.816
I mean, he's gone.

15:03.818 --> 15:06.224
I'm supposed to move on, right?

15:06.247 --> 15:09.238
I mean, that's... the healthy thing to do?

15:09.240 --> 15:12.241
Well, like I've said, there's
no right or wrong way to grieve.

15:12.243 --> 15:15.588
Sometimes allowing yourself to
indulge in memories of a loved one

15:15.628 --> 15:17.630
is the best way to get closure.

15:24.768 --> 15:27.890
Should I be paying you for this or...

15:27.892 --> 15:31.010
Well, let's just call this
two friends talking, hmm?

15:40.154 --> 15:42.447
Any leads on the general's whereabouts?

15:42.478 --> 15:43.601
We've located the phone.

15:43.664 --> 15:45.908
We're looking for any friends
or family within the area.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.847
And alerts are out at all transportation
hubs in case he skips town.

15:48.910 --> 15:52.569
I just got off the phone with
the head of security at the CMA.

15:52.631 --> 15:56.121
She's handing over inventory
logs and camera footage.

15:56.191 --> 15:59.900
He has to have accomplices to have
pulled something like this off.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.868
Found some discrepancies at the CMA.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.629
So when the CMA incinerates
its sarin canisters,

16:06.631 --> 16:09.632
it emits gases that have
to be reported to the EPA.

16:09.634 --> 16:13.018
So, by looking at the
amount of waste byproduct,

16:13.020 --> 16:14.520
you can work backwards to figure out

16:14.522 --> 16:16.689
how much sarin gas is being destroyed.

16:16.691 --> 16:18.474
And that's where the discrepancy comes in.

16:18.476 --> 16:20.276
The math doesn't add up.

16:20.278 --> 16:23.509
The CMA isn't producing the
amount of waste it should

16:23.564 --> 16:25.114
for the amount of chemical weapons

16:25.116 --> 16:26.899
it claims to be destroying.

16:26.901 --> 16:28.200
What does that mean?

16:28.202 --> 16:30.270
The general was reporting false numbers?

16:30.302 --> 16:32.020
It's one way to hide the fact

16:32.106 --> 16:34.740
that you're actually stockpiling weapons.

16:34.742 --> 16:36.375
So it might not just
be a truckload of sarin

16:36.377 --> 16:37.409
that's missing.

16:37.411 --> 16:39.662
Could be a lot more.

16:39.664 --> 16:42.164
We're talking metric tons of material

16:42.166 --> 16:43.832
that haven't been incinerated.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.268
We got something... two people
in a general security team

16:46.346 --> 16:48.921
have had their incomes padded
by some mysterious trust account.

16:48.923 --> 16:52.352
For the past three years,
these guys have been paid out

16:52.454 --> 16:54.273
over 200 grand each.

16:54.418 --> 16:55.761
The general could have been paying them

16:55.763 --> 16:57.458
to transport the weapons
out of the facility.

16:57.497 --> 16:59.322
And the same trust purchased a large farm

16:59.369 --> 17:02.268
about 30 miles outside of
the CMA three years ago.

17:02.270 --> 17:04.319
Sounds like a good place
to get off the grid.

17:04.321 --> 17:06.021
Let's move.

17:08.567 --> 17:11.076
So, Reade, is this the
end of the great bromance?

17:11.078 --> 17:12.828
What are you talking about?

17:12.829 --> 17:15.614
You and Weller.

17:15.616 --> 17:16.921
Well, clearly, this Sarah thing

17:17.034 --> 17:19.451
is getting in the way, so
you guys got to sort it out.

17:19.453 --> 17:21.787
You're making it weird for the whole team.

17:21.789 --> 17:23.756
Sarah and I broke up last night.

17:25.175 --> 17:26.497
What'd you do?

17:28.846 --> 17:30.296
Nothing. I broke up with her.

17:30.298 --> 17:32.548
Thought you said you were crazy about her.

17:33.968 --> 17:36.435
I really don't want to talk about it.

17:36.437 --> 17:39.021
Okay.

17:39.023 --> 17:41.106
I think we're looking at
the tattoos too myopically.

17:41.108 --> 17:42.108
How so?

17:42.147 --> 17:44.193
Whoever put that truck logo tattoo on Jane

17:44.195 --> 17:46.250
had very specific insider knowledge,

17:46.273 --> 17:49.922
same with every other
tattoo case we've worked.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.234
We need to take a step
back and look at who might

17:52.236 --> 17:55.704
have access to this kind of information.

17:55.706 --> 17:57.740
What are you proposing?

17:57.742 --> 17:59.491
We look at the connections
between the players

17:59.493 --> 18:01.048
and the cases we've solved.

18:01.118 --> 18:02.878
The government institutions,

18:02.880 --> 18:04.797
even the locations of the crimes.

18:04.799 --> 18:06.999
There must be some clue that points us

18:07.001 --> 18:09.418
to who did this to Jane and why.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.602
But right now, my entire
team is stretched thin

18:12.657 --> 18:16.091
just investigating the
tattoos as they come up.

18:16.093 --> 18:17.393
You need more people.

18:17.395 --> 18:19.678
I need a lot more people.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.397
The director's looking for cuts,

18:21.399 --> 18:23.291
not added expenditures.

18:23.346 --> 18:26.151
I understand, but this
is the most important case

18:26.153 --> 18:27.074
that the Bureau has.

18:27.137 --> 18:29.488
I agree... but everybody

18:29.490 --> 18:32.078
feels that way about their cases.

18:32.359 --> 18:36.328
Look, I'll see what I can do.

18:36.330 --> 18:37.363
Okay.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.510
There's nothing here.

18:51.512 --> 18:54.513
Patterson, you positive
this is the location?

18:54.515 --> 18:57.127
Um, you guys are walking on water.

18:57.174 --> 18:58.112
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

18:58.114 --> 19:00.040
I'm looking at a satellite
image from three years ago,

19:00.121 --> 19:01.437
and you're standing smack in the middle

19:01.439 --> 19:03.722
<i>of what used to be a pond.</i>

19:03.724 --> 19:06.308
Well, someone drained the pond.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.824
Ooh... not only that,

19:07.878 --> 19:10.729
but the electricity built for
that property is off the charts.

19:10.731 --> 19:13.031
Well, there is definitely
something here we're missing.

19:13.033 --> 19:14.283
Fan out.

19:14.285 --> 19:15.317
Let's have a look.

19:23.327 --> 19:24.863
Did you think for a minute

19:24.918 --> 19:26.376
how Emma would feel about you being here?

19:26.491 --> 19:28.664
I didn't do anything wrong, Kurt.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.946
You may not believe me, but I didn't have

19:30.001 --> 19:31.340
anything to do with Taylor's disappearance.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.801
Stop, Dad.

19:32.941 --> 19:34.249
I have every right to be here,

19:34.296 --> 19:35.714
just as much as anyone else

19:35.808 --> 19:37.410
who wants to pay their respects.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.892
You don't get it, do you?

19:39.894 --> 19:41.510
No one wants you here.

19:41.512 --> 19:42.761
No one.

19:43.764 --> 19:44.763
Got something.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.406
What the hell is that?

19:55.464 --> 19:56.942
Don't know.

20:00.305 --> 20:01.780
Hey, try this.

20:04.118 --> 20:05.200
Thanks.

20:07.505 --> 20:08.670
Come on.

20:08.672 --> 20:10.789
There we go.

20:15.045 --> 20:16.094
Set.

20:29.643 --> 20:30.943
General!

20:49.079 --> 20:50.128
Don't shoot.

20:53.217 --> 20:55.384
Get on your feet and put
down that weapon, General.

21:04.512 --> 21:06.395
The entire room is rigged to blow.

21:06.397 --> 21:08.480
Disarm that detonator now, General.

21:08.565 --> 21:09.506
Don't come any closer.

21:09.592 --> 21:11.850
- Disarm it!
- Don't come any closer!

21:12.900 --> 21:14.300
Or we all die.

21:23.727 --> 21:24.990
These crates.

21:25.037 --> 21:26.502
Sarin.

21:26.557 --> 21:27.849
Mustard gas.

21:27.989 --> 21:29.484
Hydrogen cyanide.

21:29.603 --> 21:31.937
Nobody gets out alive...

21:31.939 --> 21:34.272
if I take my finger off this button.

21:34.274 --> 21:36.408
Your job was to destroy
these chemical weapons.

21:36.410 --> 21:40.195
Our enemies have chemical
<i>and</i> biological weapons.

21:40.197 --> 21:41.696
You think that we're setting an example

21:41.698 --> 21:44.282
by burning our stockpile,
singing "Kumbaya"?

21:44.382 --> 21:46.001
It's delusional!

21:46.003 --> 21:48.336
We need to maintain the stockpile.

21:48.338 --> 21:50.038
Did you sell it to a foreign country?

21:50.040 --> 21:51.756
I needed a way to pay for this facility,

21:51.758 --> 21:56.344
so I sold a nominal amount
to South Korea, our allies.

21:56.346 --> 21:58.880
Then someone found out about
your sale and ambushed them.

21:58.882 --> 22:01.099
Thousands of lives are at risk now...

22:01.101 --> 22:03.435
because of you.

22:03.437 --> 22:06.304
Do you realize how
selfish your actions are?

22:06.306 --> 22:08.356
I lived through Iraq.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.058
I saw innocent lives

22:10.060 --> 22:11.726
destroyed by chemical weapons,

22:11.728 --> 22:13.812
kids with horrible deformities,

22:13.814 --> 22:16.698
entire villages wiped
out because Saddam knew

22:16.700 --> 22:19.401
he could get away with it,
that we wouldn't retaliate.

22:19.403 --> 22:21.570
That can't happen again.

22:21.572 --> 22:22.571
What are you doing?

22:25.826 --> 22:29.700
You're not going to detonate the C4.

22:29.747 --> 22:31.463
You don't want to die.

22:31.465 --> 22:35.555
You did all of this to
save lives, not take them.

22:35.649 --> 22:37.969
Jane... You stay back.

22:42.976 --> 22:44.759
- Got him?
- On him.

22:46.763 --> 22:48.313
Don't move.

22:48.315 --> 22:50.231
Who stole the chemical weapons?

22:50.233 --> 22:52.434
- Uhh!
- Who?

22:52.436 --> 22:55.153
South Koreans had a liaison.

22:55.155 --> 22:56.939
Vanessa Chang.

22:58.325 --> 22:59.324
Stand up.

22:59.326 --> 23:01.443
Stand up!

23:01.445 --> 23:02.994
She double-crossed you?

23:02.996 --> 23:05.413
We've been doing
deliveries of sarin to Seoul

23:05.415 --> 23:06.977
every quarter for the last three years.

23:07.047 --> 23:09.951
She's the only one who knows the
ins and the outs of the operation.

23:09.953 --> 23:11.589
Who is she selling it to?

23:11.667 --> 23:14.372
I don't know, but when
I realized it was her,

23:14.472 --> 23:16.007
I was afraid she'd come here.

23:16.078 --> 23:19.127
I knew I needed to destroy
all this before it's too late.

23:19.129 --> 23:20.929
How much sarin is missing?

23:21.881 --> 23:23.214
40 canisters.

23:23.216 --> 23:26.384
Did Vanessa help you move the
weapons out of the country to Korea?

23:26.386 --> 23:27.802
Through her company.

23:29.890 --> 23:32.319
<i>Patterson, search
Chang's shipping logs.</i>

23:32.358 --> 23:34.559
See if she has anything leaving today.

23:35.612 --> 23:38.349
Okay, so...

23:38.412 --> 23:40.159
Looks like her company has three containers

23:40.230 --> 23:41.932
set to sail for tonight.

23:42.010 --> 23:44.619
Two are headed for Japan and...

23:44.621 --> 23:46.988
<i>Hang on.</i>

23:46.990 --> 23:49.837
Looks like she had one
set to sail for Thailand,

23:49.978 --> 23:52.410
but she changed the
destination last week to China.

23:52.412 --> 23:54.108
Contact Port Authority.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.081
Tell 'em we're on our way.

24:08.562 --> 24:09.948
Container should be in here.

24:10.026 --> 24:12.180
Hey, it's the same logo as Sam's keycard.

24:18.033 --> 24:19.437
Nice work, Tasha.

24:25.473 --> 24:27.195
FBI! Freeze!

24:33.370 --> 24:34.502
Aah!

24:42.288 --> 24:43.902
Jane, with me.

24:47.582 --> 24:50.229
Guns away. Too risky with the sarin gas.

25:28.725 --> 25:31.426
The antidote vial is broken!

25:31.428 --> 25:32.977
Here, I've got mine.

25:32.979 --> 25:34.679
No! What about you?

25:40.461 --> 25:41.820
Uhh!

25:41.822 --> 25:42.762
Oh!

25:42.801 --> 25:44.439
Hang on, Kurt!

25:48.361 --> 25:49.661
She needs your antidote!

25:49.663 --> 25:51.412
I'm on her.

25:51.414 --> 25:53.281
I got it, here!

25:53.283 --> 25:54.866
Uhh!

25:59.456 --> 26:02.090
What's your target, Vanessa?

26:03.260 --> 26:04.425
Ohh!

26:07.430 --> 26:08.680
What is your target?!

26:08.682 --> 26:11.299
You're too late.

26:26.241 --> 26:28.032
Hey, you okay?

26:30.253 --> 26:31.369
I'm fine.

26:33.123 --> 26:34.922
I'm sore where you stabbed me.

26:34.924 --> 26:38.048
Sorry, next time I'll just
let your internal organs melt.

26:38.204 --> 26:39.356
We just checked all the containers.

26:39.434 --> 26:41.462
36 canisters of sarin accounted for.

26:41.464 --> 26:43.214
The general said that 40 were stolen.

26:43.216 --> 26:46.184
Whoever Vanessa sold the
sarin to took four canisters.

26:46.186 --> 26:48.219
Presumably to use on home soil.

26:48.221 --> 26:51.472
Do you think she was helping
them with an American target?

26:57.397 --> 26:58.946
Who do you work for?

27:02.152 --> 27:04.144
Thousands of people,

27:04.207 --> 27:06.183
including us and your own family,

27:06.261 --> 27:09.157
could be exposed to the
sarin if you don't help us.

27:12.228 --> 27:14.629
Who do you work for?!

27:16.299 --> 27:17.465
North Korea.

27:17.586 --> 27:19.584
Your container was headed for China.

27:19.586 --> 27:21.586
The plan was to move the crates

27:21.588 --> 27:24.567
through China into North Korea.

27:24.645 --> 27:26.454
- What's the target here?
- I don't know.

27:26.484 --> 27:28.783
I don't believe you!
What is the target here?

27:28.822 --> 27:30.600
I sold them the weapons, that's it.

27:30.671 --> 27:33.071
I had no idea they were
planning to use them here.

27:33.165 --> 27:36.176
The South Koreans pay
me to help the general.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.570
But the North Koreans
made me a better offer.

27:39.572 --> 27:42.740
The North Korean government is behind this?

27:42.742 --> 27:45.443
They're a radical faction
within the government.

27:45.445 --> 27:48.362
And you have no idea what
they're going to target?

27:48.364 --> 27:51.616
I swear to you, I don't know.

27:55.538 --> 27:57.648
We found these in one
of the shooter's cars.

27:57.741 --> 27:59.223
Vacuum cleaners?

27:59.285 --> 28:00.925
Not exactly.

28:01.076 --> 28:03.845
They hollowed out the inside so they
could fit the sarin gas canisters.

28:03.847 --> 28:06.221
We recovered two canisters
in another vehicle.

28:06.237 --> 28:08.368
But four are missing.

28:08.485 --> 28:09.967
Two more are out there.

28:10.117 --> 28:11.367
They also had these.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.523
"Ripley Custodial Service."

28:15.644 --> 28:17.774
They're gonna disguise
themselves as janitors.

28:17.844 --> 28:19.981
Well, we know the target's local.

28:20.020 --> 28:21.896
The question is, where?

28:21.898 --> 28:23.194
What'd you find?

28:23.265 --> 28:25.059
I'm looking into Ripley Custodial Services.

28:25.122 --> 28:27.300
This company cleans five
buildings in Manhattan.

28:27.378 --> 28:28.855
Any obvious targets?

28:28.917 --> 28:29.931
The stock exchange.

28:29.994 --> 28:30.983
Big IPO today,

28:31.053 --> 28:32.834
Ockman Industries went public.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.375
There's gonna be a lot
of press there all day.

28:34.377 --> 28:35.773
45 minutes until the closing bell.

28:35.851 --> 28:37.649
They'll want to hit it before
everybody leaves for the day.

28:37.735 --> 28:39.413
Let's move, now.

28:52.061 --> 28:54.165
It's been 25 years,

28:54.228 --> 28:56.264
but it's like it just happened.

28:56.266 --> 28:58.624
He never moved on.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.768
You sure you're still okay with this?

29:06.442 --> 29:08.442
We can't risk tipping these guys off.

29:08.444 --> 29:10.611
It needs to be a simultaneous takedown.

29:10.613 --> 29:11.704
If we only get one,

29:11.798 --> 29:14.949
we risk the other one
setting off the sarin.

29:14.951 --> 29:16.918
We have no idea where
they are in the building.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.287
Patterson just sent me the floor plan.

29:42.612 --> 29:44.896
<i>No visual on the suspect yet.</i>

30:05.501 --> 30:07.051
Reade.

30:07.053 --> 30:08.415
<i>We're trailing one, but we can't</i>

30:08.469 --> 30:10.471
<i>take him down till we've
got eyes on the other.</i>

30:13.712 --> 30:15.676
Jane, down there.

30:17.847 --> 30:19.429
Okay, we got eyes on the second suspect.

30:19.484 --> 30:20.681
He's on the trading floor.

30:22.402 --> 30:23.568
<i>Ours just entered.</i>

30:23.570 --> 30:25.987
Flank him.

30:30.050 --> 30:31.000
<i>We're on the wrong floor.</i>

30:31.055 --> 30:32.827
<i>We'll never get to him in time.</i>

30:32.829 --> 30:34.662
I got him!

30:34.664 --> 30:35.913
Jane, what are you...

31:00.899 --> 31:01.959
Should have seen the look on your face

31:01.961 --> 31:03.994
when Jane jumped through that window.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.083
You all right?

31:09.085 --> 31:10.551
Yeah, I'm just trying
to finish some paperwork

31:10.553 --> 31:12.169
before I get outta here.

31:12.171 --> 31:13.921
I can wait.

31:13.923 --> 31:15.793
No, I'm cool. I'll see you tomorrow.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.510
Look...

31:19.512 --> 31:22.263
I know this is none of my business.

31:22.265 --> 31:24.431
I think you're making a mistake with Sarah.

31:26.736 --> 31:29.770
You were really happy with her.

31:29.772 --> 31:32.523
Like, happier than I've ever seen you.

31:32.525 --> 31:35.276
If I were you, I would hold on to that.

31:38.414 --> 31:39.863
You really think it's that easy?

31:41.250 --> 31:43.771
You ever wonder why all of us are single?

31:43.911 --> 31:46.830
We chose this job for a
reason, that's who we are.

31:46.901 --> 31:50.040
We're not meant to go home to
happy wives and husbands with kids.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.792
It doesn't work that way for us.

32:02.772 --> 32:04.605
Hey...

32:04.607 --> 32:06.056
Thank you.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.904
It's so beautiful.

32:09.312 --> 32:10.896
It's my pleasure.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.564
It belonged to your mom.

32:13.566 --> 32:15.232
She bought it when you were born...

32:15.398 --> 32:16.981
to match your eyes.

32:18.988 --> 32:20.348
How did you...

32:20.418 --> 32:22.406
After she passed away,

32:22.606 --> 32:26.043
some of her things were sold.

32:26.045 --> 32:29.997
I knew how much that necklace
meant to her, so I bought it.

32:31.751 --> 32:33.634
Now it's yours.

32:36.973 --> 32:39.700
Do you want to buy me a birthday drink?

32:39.778 --> 32:43.510
Yeah, I'd love to, but
I've got plans tonight.

32:45.181 --> 32:46.353
Allie.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.065
- Yeah.
- Right.

32:49.852 --> 32:51.151
Another night.

32:51.153 --> 32:53.437
Yeah, okay. Of course.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.439
- Okay.
- Thank you.

32:55.441 --> 32:56.690
Night.

32:56.692 --> 32:57.825
Night.

33:05.493 --> 33:07.876
Reade... a moment.

33:11.216 --> 33:12.849
Take a seat.

33:19.715 --> 33:21.298
Am I in trouble?

33:21.300 --> 33:23.653
Something's been bugging me

33:23.738 --> 33:26.804
ever since our chat the other day.

33:26.806 --> 33:28.355
I appreciate you being honest

33:28.357 --> 33:31.975
about your bias against Jane, but...

33:31.977 --> 33:36.480
Everything about that talk just feels off.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.032
You think I'm lying?

33:38.034 --> 33:40.651
I think we're wired the same.

33:40.653 --> 33:44.615
Even as a young agent, everybody
knew me as a straight shooter.

33:44.701 --> 33:46.373
I'll take that a compliment.

33:48.411 --> 33:52.213
The only time I ever
strayed from my instincts

33:52.314 --> 33:54.214
was when I was scared.

33:55.918 --> 33:59.053
Now, I don't know what you're dealing with,

33:59.055 --> 34:01.796
but I think you need to tell me.

34:04.593 --> 34:07.227
I told you the truth.

34:07.229 --> 34:08.512
I'm sorry if you don't believe me,

34:08.514 --> 34:10.063
but I don't know what else to say.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.600
Anything else?

34:13.601 --> 34:14.935
No.

34:38.629 --> 34:39.995
Five grand.

35:10.242 --> 35:12.243
Thank you.

35:12.298 --> 35:14.912
Could I start you off
with something to drink?

35:14.914 --> 35:16.463
Yes.

35:16.465 --> 35:18.549
Um...

35:18.612 --> 35:20.167
Bourbon, please.

35:20.169 --> 35:21.887
Blanton's, neat.

35:35.017 --> 35:37.518
This was a mistake.

35:41.774 --> 35:44.358
I know, you're more of a Bulleit girl.

35:44.360 --> 35:47.361
Just... coming here.

35:47.363 --> 35:49.196
We love it here.

35:49.198 --> 35:51.782
David, you're dead.

35:51.784 --> 35:54.201
Details, details.

35:55.926 --> 35:57.867
Did you bring my crossword puzzle?

36:02.878 --> 36:05.718
Think you can finish by
the time dessert comes?

36:05.765 --> 36:07.022
Is that a challenge?

36:07.069 --> 36:09.015
We'll start easy.

36:09.093 --> 36:13.720
52 down, Midway alternative, five letters.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.225
O'Hare.

36:18.227 --> 36:19.810
Nice.

36:20.405 --> 36:22.062
You still got it.

36:23.899 --> 36:26.156
Reade? Really?

36:26.211 --> 36:28.418
I wouldn't want my sister dating one of us.

36:28.488 --> 36:30.737
We come with too many complications.

36:35.244 --> 36:36.743
Cheers.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.834
Hmm.

36:43.836 --> 36:47.671
The thing that does have to stop, though...

36:47.673 --> 36:50.224
is you always worrying about everyone

36:50.226 --> 36:51.510
and everything.

36:51.596 --> 36:53.060
What are you talking about?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.728
I saw that look on your face

36:54.730 --> 36:57.064
when I brought you that
muffin this morning.

36:57.095 --> 36:59.433
That was not a normal human reaction

36:59.435 --> 37:01.543
when the girl you like
surprises you with breakfast.

37:01.621 --> 37:04.104
I was genuinely happy to see you.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.906
And the muffin.

37:06.001 --> 37:07.774
- Kurt...
- What?

37:07.776 --> 37:09.610
We've been down this road before.

37:09.612 --> 37:11.612
This is usually the time
where you get cold feet.

37:13.782 --> 37:15.415
We're having fun.

37:15.417 --> 37:16.744
We haven't had a fight.

37:16.807 --> 37:17.869
The sex is good.

37:17.932 --> 37:19.419
Whoa, back it up.

37:19.537 --> 37:21.455
What do you mean... "good"?

37:21.457 --> 37:22.456
Okay, great.

37:22.458 --> 37:23.924
- The sex is great.
- Okay.

37:23.926 --> 37:25.296
Keep... keep going.

37:26.712 --> 37:28.262
What's your point?

37:28.264 --> 37:30.180
My point is...

37:33.607 --> 37:35.218
I don't want you sabotaging something

37:35.220 --> 37:37.024
because it's going great.

37:43.838 --> 37:45.479
- Mmm.
- Okay?

37:45.481 --> 37:46.980
Now throw me around like a rag doll

37:46.982 --> 37:48.650
before the Thai food gets here.

37:48.705 --> 37:49.783
Yes, ma'am.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.905
Mmm.

38:06.248 --> 38:08.665
We need you to get closer to Weller.

38:10.673 --> 38:12.566
What do you mean closer?

38:12.652 --> 38:13.563
We didn't anticipate him

38:13.625 --> 38:16.259
getting back together with Allie.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.811
You want me to break them up?

38:19.494 --> 38:20.847
We need you to be the one person

38:20.849 --> 38:22.728
he trusts the most.

38:23.519 --> 38:25.352
I can't do that.

38:26.772 --> 38:30.190
No, he's... he's been
through enough, and...

38:30.192 --> 38:32.993
I see the way he is around her and I think

38:32.995 --> 38:34.828
- that she's good for him.
- It's not about what he's been through,

38:34.906 --> 38:36.363
it's about the mission.

38:36.365 --> 38:38.031
No, I can't.

38:38.033 --> 38:40.867
Yes, you can.

38:40.869 --> 38:43.337
We're all making sacrifices.

38:44.456 --> 38:47.885
What "sacrifices" are you making?

38:49.128 --> 38:52.045
You think this is what I want?

38:52.047 --> 38:53.880
We were...

38:57.241 --> 39:01.855
Do you have any idea how hard it is

39:01.857 --> 39:04.524
to meet with you and not touch you

39:04.526 --> 39:06.393
and not tell you that I love you?

39:06.395 --> 39:09.029
You think I want you getting closer to him?

39:09.031 --> 39:11.325
I don't know what you want.

39:54.943 --> 39:57.944
"Got one... Patterson."

40:00.449 --> 40:02.449
Wait, you put this in for me.

40:03.952 --> 40:05.752
Got one what?

40:07.156 --> 40:09.586
Did you solve another tattoo?
