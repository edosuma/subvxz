and then we pick up the glass
and make new bottles again?

09:30.736 --> 09:31.930
Yep.

09:32.004 --> 09:33.596
What, like, forever?

09:33.673 --> 09:34.799
Yes.

09:34.874 --> 09:37.206
Bubb, your plan... bunks.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.800
[Laughs]
Yeah.

09:38.878 --> 09:40.243
I like it.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.712
I got a rhythm going!

09:41.781 --> 09:44.409
Dink-dink, da-dink-dink,
tink-tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink,

09:44.483 --> 09:47.509
ta-da-da-dink, dink-tink,
tink-ta-tink, ta-ta-tink-tink,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.214
dink-da-da-dink, da-da-da-da-da,

09:49.288 --> 09:50.778
da-dink!

09:50.856 --> 09:51.845
[Wenks]

09:51.924 --> 09:52.754
What?

09:52.825 --> 09:54.258
What do you want? I don't...

09:54.327 --> 09:56.488
He wants to smash the
Gumball guardian's head!

09:56.562 --> 09:58.029
We're going to
make more bottles.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.428
Just wait, okay?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.363
[Warbling]

10:01.434 --> 10:03.732
ALL:
No!!

10:03.803 --> 10:05.134
Goodbye, Princess.

10:05.204 --> 10:06.728
No.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.330
[Crack!]

10:08.407 --> 10:09.533
ICE KING:
Hey!

10:09.609 --> 10:10.633
What's going on here?

10:10.710 --> 10:12.075
Why's this place all crazy?

10:12.144 --> 10:13.372
I was just flying by and...

10:13.446 --> 10:15.073
[gasps]
Gunther!

10:15.147 --> 10:17.172
<i>You</i> took my stuff!

10:17.249 --> 10:18.307
[Wenks]

10:18.384 --> 10:19.612
That's bad!

10:19.685 --> 10:20.811
You know what you get now?

10:20.886 --> 10:21.978
[Wenks]

10:22.054 --> 10:23.316
That's right!

10:23.389 --> 10:24.720
You get the squirty-squirts.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.519
Bad! Bad!

10:26.592 --> 10:30.187
Now take off my
demonic wishing eye!

10:30.262 --> 10:32.628
[Warble!]

10:32.698 --> 10:33.687
[Pop!]

10:33.766 --> 10:36.257
All right, Gunther,
now go home!

10:36.335 --> 10:37.165
[Wenks]

10:37.236 --> 10:38.863
That's right! Walk!

10:38.938 --> 10:41.202
While you're walking home you
think about what you did!

10:41.273 --> 10:42.706
[Sighs]

10:42.775 --> 10:45.141
It's getting worse
and worse with him.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.112
He just... he hates it
when I leave the castle.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.511
I'm sorry, guys.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.948
Uh, dude,
where have you been?!

10:52.018 --> 10:54.111
Yeah, and why are you
all jacked-up?

10:54.186 --> 10:59.317
[Laughs] Well, I got into some crazy
wiz-biz over at Wizard City.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.190
Honestly, I don't even
know how I survived.

11:02.261 --> 11:05.560
Basically, it was the
craziest showdown ever.

11:05.631 --> 11:06.563
I...

11:06.632 --> 11:09.396
I wish I could tell you all
about it, but, you know,

11:09.468 --> 11:12.528
"Wizards only, fools...
keep it tight."
