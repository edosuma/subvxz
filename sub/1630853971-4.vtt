WEBVTT

00:18.416 --> 00:21.541
What do you say just us
real folks play, and leave Ollie behind?

00:21.625 --> 00:25.125
I need you to be tough for me.
You can't keep acting like some baby.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.833
<i>Back in the woods you seen that sign.</i>

01:10.333 --> 01:13.250
<i>You said we were close,</i>
<i>but it wasn't on your map.</i>

01:46.500 --> 01:47.500
Billy?

01:56.583 --> 01:57.958
<i>What a baby.</i>

01:58.041 --> 02:00.333
<i>Once you scare the bees away</i>
<i>with the smoke,</i>

02:00.416 --> 02:04.166
you pull out the frame and abracadabra.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.250
Honey.

02:06.041 --> 02:07.250
Ain't it beautiful?

02:07.833 --> 02:09.041
Stupid.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.666
Like I ain't never seen
a jar of honey before.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.458
In conclusion...

02:13.541 --> 02:14.833
She's trying to talk.

02:14.916 --> 02:17.541
I will kick your ass,
you look at me like that again.

02:17.625 --> 02:18.708
I hope one day...

02:18.791 --> 02:20.541
Don't worry about him, Billy.

02:21.416 --> 02:22.916
Momma was right.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.375
He ain't nothing but a pissant
in a pit bull's body.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.750
Thank you, Jolene.

02:28.833 --> 02:31.416
Now, who's next?

02:31.916 --> 02:34.000
Billy Wiles.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.250
You okay to share something with us today?

02:39.333 --> 02:41.291
Or do you wanna sit this one out?

02:42.791 --> 02:44.333
I'm right here, Billy.

02:45.291 --> 02:46.500
And so is Momma.

02:50.833 --> 02:51.666
I'm okay.

02:51.750 --> 02:53.125
I can do it, ma'am.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.083
Good luck.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.375
Why is he wearing a suit?

03:03.791 --> 03:05.375
His Momma just died.

03:08.166 --> 03:09.708
What you got there, Billy?

03:17.916 --> 03:18.916
This is Ollie.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.708
Speak up, now.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.375
This is Ollie.

03:23.875 --> 03:25.791
He's a very good friend of mine.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.416
My best friend.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.833
We do lots of things together.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.375
-Hi, Ollie!
-Michael Wayne Apple.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.000
Don't you test me.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.833
You and Ollie do things together?

03:45.916 --> 03:47.000
Go on.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.625
Tell them about our adventures.

03:49.708 --> 03:52.791
About all the nasty creatures
lurking in the hills!

03:54.125 --> 03:56.708
We go camping near Castleman's Nob.

03:57.875 --> 04:00.083
And solve supernatural mysteries.

04:00.166 --> 04:03.291
My daddy says all kind of things
roam around up there.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.791
There is! Bigfoots.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.250
I mean Bigfeet.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.333
-Me and Ollie seen their tracks.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.541
We tried hunting them down once
but they're awful hard to sneak up on.

04:11.625 --> 04:14.541
And you know when they're close
'cause they smell like doodoo.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.458
I mean, they don't smell good at all.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.125
And that ain't all.

04:22.208 --> 04:26.791
We built us a pirate ship out of an old
refrigerator box that Daddy gave me.

04:26.875 --> 04:31.916
Let's show these guppies
what real pirating looks like!

04:33.750 --> 04:36.291
Arr, I'll make you walk the plank

04:36.375 --> 04:38.333
if you don't show me
where you hid your booty.

04:38.416 --> 04:40.500
I told you, I don't have the booty.

04:40.583 --> 04:41.916
I never had the booty!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.458
I don't know where the booty
could possibly be!

04:44.541 --> 04:45.625
Blimey!

04:45.708 --> 04:48.791
Don't try to hornswoggle me.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.458
We'll ask me fine crew.

04:50.541 --> 04:53.458
Do you believe this filthy bilge rat?

04:53.541 --> 04:55.625
No!

04:55.708 --> 05:00.000
Then it's decided!
To Davy Jones' locker, you go!

05:11.291 --> 05:13.250
Ha, ha, ha!

05:13.833 --> 05:16.250
Now, what did I say?

05:16.333 --> 05:18.083
I told you not to test me.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.416
Just enjoying the show, Mrs. Cunningham.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.291
Shut up, you stupid redneck.

05:22.375 --> 05:25.416
Hey, now, Jolene.
We don't use that word.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.166
Which one? "Stupid" or "redneck"?

05:28.250 --> 05:31.000
Would you two like to take a walk
to Mr. Carnes' office?

05:32.458 --> 05:33.291
No, ma'am.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.666
Go on, Billy.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.125
Finish telling us about your pal, Ollie.

05:40.916 --> 05:41.750
That's all.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.875
Well, thank you for sharing, Billy.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.375
That was very brave.

06:00.416 --> 06:01.250
No.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.250
Excuse you!

06:24.416 --> 06:25.250
Hey.

06:26.333 --> 06:27.375
Are you okay?

06:28.291 --> 06:29.125
You know...

06:30.000 --> 06:31.416
if we were real pirates,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.416
we'd pull out our swords
and make them walk the plank,

06:34.500 --> 06:39.083
and then we'd feed
his stupid dumb guts to the sharks!

06:39.166 --> 06:41.750
We are real pirates.

06:43.791 --> 06:44.625
Billy?

06:45.125 --> 06:45.958
Momma--

06:46.791 --> 06:49.375
Momma wanted me
to tell you something. Hey!

06:49.458 --> 06:52.083
-Hey, give him back!
-I got him! I got his doll!

06:52.166 --> 06:53.708
You want him back?

06:53.791 --> 06:55.125
Maybe I'll just keep him.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.083
Dissect him.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.125
-Stop it, Michael. Stop it.
-You want him?

07:01.208 --> 07:02.083
Come and get him.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.708
Leave him alone.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.750
Get away! Get away from him!

07:10.833 --> 07:12.416
You need a girl to fight for you?

07:12.500 --> 07:15.208
I thought you was a pirate,
Captain Dumbass.

07:20.083 --> 07:23.041
Little baby needs his dolly!

07:30.041 --> 07:32.458
There's your stupid toy, baby!

07:37.666 --> 07:39.833
Captain Billy.

07:41.791 --> 07:42.958
What a baby.

07:48.791 --> 07:50.291
<i>I need you to be tough for me.</i>

07:50.375 --> 07:52.041
<i>Ollie, what's this black spot?</i>

07:52.125 --> 07:54.041
-<i>You need to grow up.</i>
-<i> What a baby!</i>

07:54.125 --> 07:56.375
You can't keep acting like some baby.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.291
No.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.916
-No.
-<i>Baby.</i>

08:04.125 --> 08:04.958
Billy?

08:18.708 --> 08:20.333
I ain't no baby.

08:24.958 --> 08:25.791
Billy.

08:35.625 --> 08:36.750
He left me.

09:06.791 --> 09:07.791
Oh...

09:14.875 --> 09:18.000
Hey! Your daddy teach you to run too?

09:18.083 --> 09:20.583
I've been chasing you for a couple blocks.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.625
Mr. Rhoades?

09:23.708 --> 09:25.416
You shouldn't be out here!

09:25.500 --> 09:27.708
Come on, now!
Let's get you out of this rain!

09:36.625 --> 09:38.833
Come on. Let's get you somewhere dry.

10:42.750 --> 10:43.708
Come on.

10:43.791 --> 10:45.875
You can wait inside for your daddy.

10:45.958 --> 10:46.833
Yes, sir.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.833
I'll grab you a towel.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.291
Wait over here.

11:08.666 --> 11:10.250
Mm, mm, mm.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.250
Good God.

11:13.333 --> 11:17.291
Your daddy would kill me if he thought
I'd let you run out into the cold.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.500
Let's get you warmed up.

11:23.791 --> 11:25.166
I'll give him a call.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.625
Thank you, misters.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.750
Did you find your dolly?

11:46.958 --> 11:50.541
Anyone ever tell you
you look like Cecil Burden's mutt?

11:51.625 --> 11:54.125
The dumb one who can't keep
his tongue in his mouth

11:54.208 --> 11:56.208
because he lost all his teeth.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.291
Hey, little man.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.166
Don't be breaking my stick now.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.541
What are you gonna do,
poke me with that thing?

12:02.625 --> 12:04.833
I'm gonna make you walk the plank.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.666
Oh. I get it.

12:06.750 --> 12:08.708
Baby's gonna put on another show.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.333
It's gonna be fun whupping your ass.

12:12.416 --> 12:15.166
Not if I turn you into shark bait first.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.208
Kids, come on, now. Stop messing around.

12:17.291 --> 12:18.583
I ain't no kid!

12:41.375 --> 12:42.500
It's just us.

12:42.583 --> 12:45.833
Your little girlfriend and your bunny
ain't here to save you now.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.708
So show me how tough you are, pirate.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.041
Stupid.

12:54.666 --> 12:56.500
You going to a wedding

12:56.583 --> 12:57.875
or a funeral?

13:08.500 --> 13:11.333
You are the true pirate king.

13:13.625 --> 13:14.916
All right, now.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.125
Leave him be.

13:17.458 --> 13:20.166
Is there something wrong with your feet?

13:20.250 --> 13:22.541
I ain't falling for no, baby--

13:26.166 --> 13:27.416
Damn.

13:30.833 --> 13:34.500
-I'm the pirate king, you son of a bit--
-Billy! Hey!

13:34.583 --> 13:35.416
Billy!

14:35.875 --> 14:37.708
<i>You kept my stars?</i>

14:41.083 --> 14:45.583
<i>The Mountain Queen</i>
<i>stole the stars from the night sky,</i>

14:45.666 --> 14:49.541
turned them to gold and christened them--

14:49.625 --> 14:52.291
The Twin Stars of Enchantment.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.125
<i>As long as these stars</i>
<i>are near each other,</i>

14:59.208 --> 15:01.291
<i>we shall never be apart.</i>

16:01.416 --> 16:02.416
Ollie.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.166
I know you're there.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.583
-Hiya.
-Uh...

16:18.750 --> 16:19.625
Hello.

16:22.375 --> 16:25.458
This gown really brings out my eyes,
don't you think?

16:27.375 --> 16:30.541
Gives me that natural smoky eye thing.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.291
Very hospital chic.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.291
Oh, can you get me some water, baby?

16:44.083 --> 16:45.291
Just a sip of water?

16:46.666 --> 16:47.500
Mm.

17:00.625 --> 17:01.875
Thanks, darling.

17:01.958 --> 17:04.208
God, I wish it was something stronger.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.000
You should rest.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.750
Do you know how much you mean to my boy?

17:19.541 --> 17:20.666
To this family?

17:24.541 --> 17:25.666
I'm worried, Ollie.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.583
I don't know how it's gonna be for them
when I'm gone.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.375
I don't want them to fall apart.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.625
I think they're having a tough time.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.916
And neither of them really know
how to handle all this.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.916
Especially Billy's daddy.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.083
Jimmy's a good man.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.250
I just worry that there's--

18:01.750 --> 18:03.083
There's a gap there.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.750
It's all callused up.

18:07.458 --> 18:10.750
Young'uns need to be told
that they're loved, and sometimes...

18:11.250 --> 18:14.250
daddies ain't so good at that.
Know what I'm talking about, Ollie?

18:17.416 --> 18:18.875
So now, listen.

18:18.958 --> 18:21.458
There's something I need you to do for me.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.875
Something I need you to pass on.

18:25.791 --> 18:27.500
To help them when I'm gone.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.833
It's what you were made for.

18:35.708 --> 18:37.250
Can you do that for me?

19:06.125 --> 19:07.875
All the things we done.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.708
And all the things we hope to do.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.666
<i>There's something I need you to do for me.</i>

20:01.166 --> 20:03.041
It's what you were made for.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.833
Don't worry, Billy.

20:11.625 --> 20:13.000
I'm coming home.

21:34.833 --> 21:36.750
I was looking for you all night.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.916
You sneak off without telling me, Billy.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.041
Running all over town.

21:51.166 --> 21:53.833
Wrecking your suit,
putting posters up, like--

21:56.208 --> 21:57.625
Like a lunatic.

22:00.958 --> 22:03.208
Looking for that damn rabbit of yours.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.416
And then, Billy, I find you in a bar.

22:10.833 --> 22:13.583
Getting ready to beat the crap
out of some other kid.

22:22.791 --> 22:24.500
That's one hell of a day.

22:48.208 --> 22:51.500
So, what are we gonna do now?

22:55.541 --> 22:59.000
We gotta go into that
big empty house, Billy, but, uh...

23:04.416 --> 23:06.333
I don't think I can do it alone.

23:08.541 --> 23:11.291
-I'm sorry I ain't more grown up, Daddy.
-Oh, come on.

23:11.375 --> 23:14.125
I wish I was tougher just like you.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.708
Shh. Billy.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.125
Oh, man.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.708
You're way tougher than I ever was, Billy.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.958
Tough don't mean you can't cry.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.333
Why don't we leave
a light on for old Ollie?

23:55.750 --> 23:56.708
Okay?

24:01.875 --> 24:02.916
All right.

24:09.291 --> 24:10.291
Let's go in.

24:58.583 --> 24:59.500
Billy!

25:00.541 --> 25:02.166
Billy, I'm home!

25:10.083 --> 25:11.250
No.

25:12.458 --> 25:13.291
No.

25:17.416 --> 25:18.500
They're gone.

25:23.583 --> 25:24.833
I'm too late.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.208
I'm too late.

25:59.500 --> 26:01.375
<i>Bow to your king, good knight.</i>

26:01.458 --> 26:04.333
-<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>
-<i>Come on. Bow, I say. Come on.</i>

26:04.416 --> 26:05.500
Dance with me.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.458
Oh, God. How long?

26:13.125 --> 26:16.041
<i>Rabid Rabbit launches into the mud pit.</i>

26:16.125 --> 26:17.416
<i>There's the hoop spiral!</i>

26:17.500 --> 26:20.000
And he sets his record!

26:20.083 --> 26:22.750
Oh, and the crowd goes wild!

26:30.000 --> 26:33.666
<i>Are you prepared</i>
<i>for a dangerous quest, matey?</i>

26:34.375 --> 26:35.375
<i>Arr!</i>

26:57.708 --> 26:59.291
<i>What do we do when we're scared?</i>

26:59.375 --> 27:01.083
-<i>Mark Twain?</i>
-<i>That's right.</i>

27:01.166 --> 27:04.333
We think of the stars
and we sing our song.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.958
And we take a ride on Mark Twain.

27:18.125 --> 27:20.875
<i>Don't ever forget me, okay?</i>

27:21.458 --> 27:22.416
<i>Never.</i>

27:46.208 --> 27:47.500
He did look for me.

27:58.750 --> 27:59.666
I'm sorry.

28:01.666 --> 28:02.625
I missed it.

28:07.458 --> 28:08.625
I missed all of it.

28:21.791 --> 28:23.333
You have a question?

28:23.416 --> 28:26.083
Well, we don't look
like each other, do we?

28:26.625 --> 28:27.833
Hmm.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.791
Do you look like Ollie?

28:32.500 --> 28:33.625
He's a bunny, Momma.

28:33.708 --> 28:35.750
But you still love him, don't you?

28:35.833 --> 28:37.916
-With all my heart.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.375
Mm-hm.

28:40.541 --> 28:42.125
Do you know where Ollie came from?

28:42.583 --> 28:43.500
No?

28:44.625 --> 28:46.000
Well, when you were little...

28:47.666 --> 28:48.916
you were alone.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.833
And you needed us, Mommy and Daddy,

28:51.916 --> 28:55.791
but I thought that maybe
you needed somebody else,

28:55.875 --> 28:57.416
somebody special.

28:58.833 --> 29:02.708
So, I took one of Daddy's shirts--
You know that real stinky one?

29:03.208 --> 29:04.541
<i>--and I made his right ear,</i>

29:04.625 --> 29:07.916
<i>and then I took one of Mommy's dresses</i>
<i>and I made his other ear,</i>

29:08.458 --> 29:11.708
<i>and then more and more,</i>

29:12.666 --> 29:15.333
<i>magically, arms and legs appeared,</i>

29:16.708 --> 29:17.833
-then a face.

29:17.916 --> 29:18.958
But he needed a heart.

29:21.375 --> 29:23.958
And that jingle comes from
my very best friend

29:24.041 --> 29:25.208
in the whole wide world.

29:26.083 --> 29:29.208
-You had your own buddy?
-Yes! I sure did.

29:29.750 --> 29:33.958
She was a dancing princess
from the far-off land of Bali Hai.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.875
And we sure as heck
didn't look anything alike.

29:37.541 --> 29:40.000
Her name was Nina,
and I loved her with all my heart.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.791
She fell apart a long time ago

29:45.583 --> 29:48.250
but a piece of her lives inside Ollie.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.125
Forever. A memory that'll never fade.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.083
Like Ollie.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.291
Ollie is us.

29:55.375 --> 29:57.416
Our memories all stitched together.

29:58.291 --> 29:59.208
Really?

29:59.291 --> 30:00.750
Yeah, really.

30:01.708 --> 30:04.458
Nina was mine, Ollie is yours,

30:04.541 --> 30:07.791
and you are mine.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.583
Look at me.

30:10.458 --> 30:13.833
You are my heart,
always and forever. Got it?

30:13.916 --> 30:14.791
Got it.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.375
<i>-Te amo.</i>
<i>-Te amo.</i>

30:16.458 --> 30:17.458
Big hug.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.500
Nina.

30:43.208 --> 30:44.791
What did you do to her?

30:46.416 --> 30:48.458
What did you do to my Nina?

30:48.541 --> 30:50.458
I didn't do anything to her!

30:50.541 --> 30:51.666
Get back here!

31:04.166 --> 31:06.583
The whole time! Lying to my face!

31:06.666 --> 31:08.041
Were you jealous?

31:08.750 --> 31:12.208
-You and Billy pull her apart for fun?
-No!

31:12.291 --> 31:14.083
You took her bell, didn't you!

31:18.166 --> 31:19.125
No!

31:21.125 --> 31:26.250
-What did you do to Nina?
-I didn't!

31:26.791 --> 31:28.541
She fell apart!

31:29.000 --> 31:33.375
She was loved so much, and she fell apart!

31:48.708 --> 31:51.083
Billy's momma couldn't let her go.

31:51.166 --> 31:57.041
So she put a piece of her inside of me.

31:58.458 --> 32:00.625
Nina! Nina!

32:06.333 --> 32:07.750
I know how you feel.

32:09.166 --> 32:11.958
It hurts so, so bad.

32:13.750 --> 32:14.875
But that's okay.

32:16.625 --> 32:18.125
It's okay to hurt.

32:26.333 --> 32:27.833
-Here.

32:27.916 --> 32:31.000
If you need it,
if it'll make you feel better,

32:33.125 --> 32:34.458
you can have it.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.750
I thank the Lord I met you.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.625
You made it.

33:29.333 --> 33:30.250
You're home.

34:58.500 --> 34:59.708
Oh, my God.

36:45.625 --> 36:47.125
I got something for you, baby.

36:48.375 --> 36:49.333
Daddy!

36:52.458 --> 36:53.541
Ollie?

36:57.250 --> 36:58.750
You know this little guy?

37:00.250 --> 37:01.750
I sure do.

37:02.541 --> 37:05.750
You were meant to come home
with me all along, weren't you?

37:08.666 --> 37:11.166
You know, Ollie was my best friend.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.916
My momma made him for me.

37:14.125 --> 37:16.916
He was lost for a long time, but...

37:18.125 --> 37:20.416
Somehow, he found his way home.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.500
And now he's yours.

37:29.666 --> 37:31.000
This is my wall.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.500
My daddy helped me make it.

37:32.583 --> 37:35.708
He made one with his momma
when he was a little boy.

37:35.791 --> 37:38.208
It's got all my favorite places:

37:38.291 --> 37:40.125
Granddaddy Jimmy's house,

37:40.208 --> 37:42.875
the Pancake Palace
where I go every Sunday,

37:43.666 --> 37:44.750
and the radish patch.

37:44.833 --> 37:49.250
Oh, I love the radish patch.
Now we can play just like I told you.

38:16.750 --> 38:19.375
Daddy! Ollie wants me
to tell you something.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.041
He says it's from your momma.

38:24.041 --> 38:24.958
Uh-huh.

38:25.666 --> 38:26.833
Uh-huh.

38:26.916 --> 38:27.875
<i>Now listen...</i>

38:28.291 --> 38:30.541
There's something I need you to do for me.

38:31.416 --> 38:33.333
Something I need you to pass on.

38:34.000 --> 38:34.833
Yeah.

38:35.583 --> 38:36.625
I'll tell him.

38:37.375 --> 38:42.375
Daddy, your momma wanted
you to know that you can be sad...

38:42.458 --> 38:44.041
But don't grow bitter.

38:45.666 --> 38:48.708
You can be mad, but not with each other.

38:50.958 --> 38:52.958
And just because you lose someone,

38:53.958 --> 38:55.208
doesn't mean they're gone.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.500
<i>As long as these stars</i>
<i>are near each other,</i>

39:36.583 --> 39:38.541
<i>we shall never be apart.</i>

39:52.375 --> 39:53.458
Wanna play?

40:08.541 --> 40:11.375
-<i>Billy?</i>
-<i>Yeah?</i>

40:15.500 --> 40:17.375
<i>Don't ever forget me.</i>

40:20.083 --> 40:21.000
<i>Okay?</i>

40:24.416 --> 40:25.666
<i>No matter what.</i>

40:30.916 --> 40:31.875
<i>Never.</i>
