Look it, is it white?

03:07.922 --> 03:09.521

- Free toilet paper.

has children and stop working,

about to deliver a baby?

18:39.018 --> 18:41.619
- Brown, go get the towels!

18:41.721 --> 18:43.688
Baby, give me the stethoscope
out of there, please.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.289
[heavy breathing]

18:45.391 --> 18:47.158
Oh my gosh, he may have
just fainted.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.660
Okay, sometimes in old people--

18:50.830 --> 18:53.564
when they strain, it
lowers their blood pressure

18:53.666 --> 18:55.299
and diminishes blood flow
to the brain.

18:55.401 --> 18:56.434
- I was sitting on the toilet

18:56.536 --> 18:57.502
the other day--
- Mr. Brown, please,

18:57.604 --> 18:59.036
please hush, I need to be
able to hear.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.772
- Okay. What is it saying?
- Oh my gosh.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.374
Mr. Reginald?

19:05.879 --> 19:07.678

19:08.748 --> 19:12.016
- Mr. Reginald, I think
you're gonna be okay.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.351
I think you just laughed
too hard.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.419
You may have lost consciousness.

19:15.522 --> 19:19.123
- I think you got light man
syndrome.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.160
And I'm supposed--
- Nice and steady. Sshhh.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.195
His airways were clear.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.863
And his heart rate is steady.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.231
Mr. Reginald?

[coughs]
- And I'm sorry

19:32.572 --> 19:35.907
my exercise regiment was
too "rig-er-fus" for you.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.475
- Please.
- Can't handle 'em.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.278
- You're family now, okay?
Thank you, Grandpa.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.180
Drink some of this water.
- Come on, let's help him up.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.581
- Drown him with--
- Oh, baby, we should just

19:43.683 --> 19:45.917
let him sit here for a minute,
okay?

19:46.019 --> 19:48.085
Yeah?

19:48.188 --> 19:51.889
- See, baby?
We need you.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.024
- [sighs]

19:53.126 --> 19:55.193
- You got a nursing degree?
- Yes.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.228
- You got experience?
- Uh, ten years

19:57.330 --> 19:58.429

19:58.531 --> 20:01.666

20:15.415 --> 20:17.949
We're forgetting one thing.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.351
Let me see that.
Mm-hmm.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.254
- Okay.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.456
