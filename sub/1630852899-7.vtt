on From...

00:10.488 --> 00:12.534
If these voices are real,

00:12.534 --> 00:14.492
if something here is
communicating with you,

00:14.492 --> 00:16.277
then that means you're
connected to this place

00:16.277 --> 00:17.713
in a way that
no one else here is.

00:17.713 --> 00:18.670
But we need proof.

00:18.670 --> 00:20.237
What is this?

00:20.237 --> 00:22.544
They said they
watched you bury the bag

00:22.544 --> 00:25.112
and that this is proof
that they're real.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.591
Do you know what that means?

00:26.591 --> 00:27.853
Can I have my pillow back?

00:27.853 --> 00:29.855
I just want to take a nap

00:29.855 --> 00:31.814
and it's sort of like a
security blanket for me, you
know?

00:31.814 --> 00:34.860
Yeah, I totally get it.
I'm sorry again.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.863
You know, it's kinda funny.
I have a shirt just like that.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.865
Oh, I know.
I got this out of your suitcase.

00:39.865 --> 00:42.129
What's wrong?

00:42.129 --> 00:44.305
I think maybe
I-I made a mistake.

00:44.305 --> 00:46.829
I knew all about the divorce
and how this whole trip

00:46.829 --> 00:48.352
was just one last hurrah

00:48.352 --> 00:50.006
before you sat us down
to break the news.

00:50.006 --> 00:53.444
Thomas is dead!
You have two other kids!

00:53.444 --> 00:54.576
Why aren't we enough for you?

00:56.926 --> 00:58.101
What is that?

00:58.101 --> 00:59.711
A Farway Tree.

00:59.711 --> 01:00.799
Watch.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.455
How does it do that?

01:04.455 --> 01:05.761
I don't know.
But guess what.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.242
-What?
-It works for people too.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.200
Really?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.942
Problem is, you never know
where you'll end up.

01:12.942 --> 01:14.552
There's no wire in here.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.814
What?

01:15.814 --> 01:18.817
In the cord. And the plug?

01:18.817 --> 01:21.559
Look.
None of it makes any sense.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.129
Mom!

01:26.129 --> 01:27.870
Everything about
this is impossible,

01:27.870 --> 01:30.090
but we can find out
where those wires go.

01:37.227 --> 01:40.056
There was this weird fucking
symbol right on the ceiling!

01:40.056 --> 01:42.102
What are you looking for? Hmm?

01:48.847 --> 01:50.893
I have this crazy idea
that might actually work, and

01:50.893 --> 01:53.069
and if it does,

01:53.069 --> 01:55.593
I might be able to find a
way to get these people home.

01:58.030 --> 02:00.598
They're so beautiful.

02:02.600 --> 02:05.037
I'm so glad you like them.

02:05.037 --> 02:07.605
When can I come inside?

02:20.314 --> 02:22.490
It's actually kind of rude.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.144
I know.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.972
What? Not acceptable.
No way.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.025
Oh, let's not make a big deal.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.073
It's a party,
you guys, like...

02:44.294 --> 02:46.514
-Okay, pick one.
-Um, this one.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.258
I don't know,
it just seems kinda weird

02:51.258 --> 02:53.390
to be celebrating the day
that you got stuck here.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.957
You're looking
at this the wrong way.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.828
It's about celebrating survival.

02:58.961 --> 03:01.137
It reminds everybody
that it's possible.

03:01.137 --> 03:04.967
Besides, it's nice having
a little party once in a while.

03:06.490 --> 03:09.101
Okay, what are you looking for?

03:09.101 --> 03:11.669
I am not looking.
I am digging.

03:11.669 --> 03:14.803
Aha! Here it is.

03:14.803 --> 03:16.196
It's my secret stash.

03:19.068 --> 03:23.333
Trudy loves this sweater.

03:23.333 --> 03:26.728
It's the one thing I own that I
don't let her get her hands on.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.600
Besides, it is Ellis' favorite.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.824
What?

03:35.824 --> 03:38.870
Nothing.
Uh...

03:38.870 --> 03:42.265
You just you make this
place seem almost normal.

03:42.265 --> 03:44.615
You're really special.

03:44.615 --> 03:47.009
Don't be silly.
We're all really special.

03:47.009 --> 03:49.446
Even Trudy.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.622
That's something a really
special person would say.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.195
There's my girls.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.023
Uh, anybody up
for a little pre game?

04:01.023 --> 04:02.938
Baby, the party hasn't
even started yet.

04:02.938 --> 04:06.507
I know! I know!
That's why they call it pregame.

04:07.943 --> 04:08.726
What?

04:10.772 --> 04:12.121
Nothing.

04:12.121 --> 04:14.863
Just... go easy, okay?

04:14.863 --> 04:15.951
Yeah, I know.
I know. I know.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.041
Uh, Julie?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.956
How 'bout you?

04:20.956 --> 04:23.959
Uh... I'm good, thanks.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.874
Okay.

04:25.874 --> 04:28.833
Okay, whatever.
You guys suck.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.662
Victor?
Victor, where you at, man?

04:31.662 --> 04:33.273
Let's get this party started!

04:33.273 --> 04:36.101
Is he okay?

04:36.101 --> 04:39.409
Nights like this are just
a little tough for him.

04:39.409 --> 04:41.542
As much as you celebrate
the people who make it,

04:41.542 --> 04:43.674
you also remember
the ones who didn't.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.680
Here, you should wear this.
It'll look really cute.

04:57.993 --> 04:59.386
Okay, come on, man.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.953
I mean, you of all people
should be hammered today.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.172
I mean, how many years
have you been here for?

05:03.172 --> 05:05.000
Please leave me alone.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.045
-Oh...
-Ellis!

05:07.045 --> 05:07.959
Ellis!

05:10.048 --> 05:11.485
You want a shot?

05:13.051 --> 05:14.488
Okay.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.058
Donna, there's no more peaches.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.974
I know. We're, uh...

05:22.974 --> 05:25.107
We're all out.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.283
They're gone?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.024
I thought I had a few more cans
stashed away in the basement,

05:29.024 --> 05:31.156
but, uh...

05:31.156 --> 05:34.072
I've been putting some
other things aside for you.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.074
Some fruit cocktail.
Some cranberries

05:36.074 --> 05:38.338
The peaches are gone.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.470
All these years, that's

05:40.470 --> 05:42.254
that's the one thing
that's never changed,

05:42.254 --> 05:45.083
and now they're gone.

05:45.083 --> 05:47.216
I'm sorry, Victor.

05:47.216 --> 05:48.913
Yeah.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.933
Kevin, come on!
It'll be dark soon.

06:08.933 --> 06:10.195

He's completely
passed out.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.626
Well, pretty sure

11:10.626 --> 11:12.628
you violated
about a dozen child labor laws

11:12.628 --> 11:15.413
by having him dig
in the basement all day.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.938
No, he was having fun.
He just wanted to help.

11:21.942 --> 11:24.684

windows are nailed shut.

of those things in if he tried.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.306
Yeah, yeah.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.964
Fuck! And then I think about
Julie up in that house.

11:43.964 --> 11:47.184
Donna, the lady who runs
the place, she might be a...

11:49.926 --> 11:52.189

definitely not stupid.

11:52.189 --> 11:52.886
Yeah.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.585
How's it going?

11:56.585 --> 11:58.587
Well...

11:58.587 --> 12:00.415
provided I can
convince the sheriff

12:00.415 --> 12:02.939
to let me use all of
their building materials,

12:02.939 --> 12:05.812
not to mention drain every
single battery they've got,

12:05.812 --> 12:07.552
and get Donna
to allow us to build

12:07.552 --> 12:09.250
on the high ground
at Colony House,

12:09.250 --> 12:10.599
should be just promising enough

12:10.599 --> 12:12.819
for everyone to hate me
when it fails.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.472
Oh, come on,
don't say that.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.213
You got a signal.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.389
No, come on.
I got static.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.565
That's a far cry from a signal.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.132
Well, but it's something.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.135
Yeah.

Hey. Hey.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.842
It matters.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.800
And look,
look on the bright side,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.541
at least we've got our hole in
the basement to fall back on.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.716
Or in.

12:40.716 --> 12:43.153
Or in.
I'm gonna head back down.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.070
Best get to it.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.429
Oh, shit.

Hey, watch where
you're going, man. Fuck.

Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Hold on.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.522
-Hey.
-Maybe slow down a little bit.

13:04.522 --> 13:05.828
Hey, I'm I'm fine.
I'm fine.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.656
It's a party, right?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.440
Don't worry.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.750
Is everything okay?

13:14.750 --> 13:16.926
Yeah, I think so.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.798
He said not to worry,
so I'm going to worry.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.845
All right,
everybody settle down now!

13:22.845 --> 13:24.455
-Everybody!
-We should go.

13:24.455 --> 13:25.761
Yeah, yeah, yes.

13:25.761 --> 13:29.504
Hey, shut your fucking mouths!

13:31.506 --> 13:33.551
All right.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.945
We are here tonight

13:35.945 --> 13:39.340
to celebrate a very
special anniversary.

13:39.340 --> 13:40.732
Yeah.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.299
One year ago today...

13:45.650 --> 13:48.305
...our dear sweet Fatima
came into our lives.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.308
Some of you
were here then,

13:51.308 --> 13:55.051
many of you arrived since.

13:55.051 --> 13:58.663
But all of you have
come to know her

13:58.663 --> 14:00.665
and to love her,

14:00.665 --> 14:04.713
for her kindness,
for her strength,

14:04.713 --> 14:05.757
for her wisdom

14:05.757 --> 14:07.368
And for her weed!

14:10.980 --> 14:13.504
The green thumb is
definitely a big plus.

14:15.115 --> 14:17.465
Our greenhouse
never smelled so good.

14:19.728 --> 14:22.513
But, uh, seriously,

14:22.513 --> 14:26.082
the truth is...

14:26.082 --> 14:28.693
you've made this big
old drafty box

14:28.693 --> 14:29.651
feel a little bit
more like home.

14:31.827 --> 14:34.656
Happy anniversary, sweet pea.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.484
Donna...

14:39.835 --> 14:41.141
Thank you.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.455
This is so beautiful.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.546
May it catch
all the bad dreams...

14:57.722 --> 15:00.334
...and let only
the sweet ones reach you.

15:02.553 --> 15:03.903
-Come here.
-Thank you.

15:05.774 --> 15:10.605
Oh. We are so lucky to have you.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.303
So lucky to have...

15:13.303 --> 15:15.566
-All right with the mushy.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.526
All right, everybody,
you all know the protocol.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.746
Drink, smoke, have fun,

15:21.746 --> 15:24.836
keep an eye on each other.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.621
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

15:26.621 --> 15:27.927
Cheers, baby.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.497
Happy anniversary, gorgeous.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.542
Thank you.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.643
Look at what
she got me.

15:48.643 --> 15:49.949
She made this herself.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.690
Aw!

15:52.690 --> 15:55.171
So, that's the plan. Yup.

15:55.171 --> 15:57.217
Find a way outta here
once and for all

15:57.217 --> 16:00.220
before it all comes
crashing down around us.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.398
Your turn.

16:09.925 --> 16:12.623
I buried this bag
the day I arrived.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.151
Open it.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.289
Holding out on me?

16:30.815 --> 16:32.382
This yours?

16:35.168 --> 16:38.910
I'm not talking about the shirt.
I'm talking about the blood.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.216
There's another item in the bag.

16:45.178 --> 16:48.007
I mean, what what is it?
What the fuck is going on?

16:51.923 --> 16:55.057
We've never really
discussed who we used to be...

16:55.057 --> 16:58.495
before we came here.

17:08.114 --> 17:12.683
There was this young boy
in my congregation.

17:12.683 --> 17:16.818
He was quiet, sensitive.

17:18.776 --> 17:20.909
He used to get so excited

17:20.909 --> 17:22.693
when his mother let him put a
dollar in the collection plate.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.178
One day, after mass,

17:29.178 --> 17:32.573
I found him lingering
outside the rectory

17:32.573 --> 17:35.532
and it was unusual.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.536
You know, he wasn't
really the type of kid

17:39.536 --> 17:40.885
to stray too far
from his parents.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.845
They were very, um...

17:43.845 --> 17:45.629
strict...

17:47.805 --> 17:51.157
...rigid.

17:51.157 --> 17:55.117
And I get it. Parents,
they worry about their kids,

17:55.117 --> 17:57.728
and sometimes you have...

18:01.950 --> 18:03.952
I'm sorry.
Do you mind?

18:13.092 --> 18:17.835
Anyway, the point is...

18:17.835 --> 18:19.489
the boy was upset.

18:21.926 --> 18:24.015
He asked if he
could stay a while.

18:24.015 --> 18:27.236
But I had to prepare
for evening mass

18:27.236 --> 18:31.588
and I didn't want
the parents to worry.

18:33.895 --> 18:37.768
So I, uh...

18:37.768 --> 18:40.945
I went to my drawer and
I pulled out a candy bar.

18:40.945 --> 18:45.472
I, uh I always keep a
stash for the neighborhood kids.

18:48.605 --> 18:51.130
I could see he
didn't want to go.

18:53.088 --> 18:58.137
But I handed it to him
and I sent him on his way.

19:02.271 --> 19:06.710
Later that evening, I,
uh I went by the house.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.238
It was a bit unorthodox.

19:12.238 --> 19:16.067
You know, I'm not really in
the habit of making house calls,

19:16.067 --> 19:18.853
but something was
nagging me and I just...

19:21.725 --> 19:23.249
As I walked up the driveway,

19:23.249 --> 19:25.816
the mother,
she came running out,

19:25.816 --> 19:30.038
hysterical...

19:30.038 --> 19:32.649
inconsolable.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.347
She was...

19:37.959 --> 19:39.743
And I could smell the alcohol

19:39.743 --> 19:41.441
the moment I stepped
through the door.

19:42.746 --> 19:46.141
The father was just...

19:46.141 --> 19:48.012
standing there
with this panicked,

19:48.012 --> 19:50.058
dumbfounded look on his face.

19:50.058 --> 19:53.496
"Get up! Get up!" he said.

19:57.413 --> 20:01.809
I walked over and I stepped in
the room, and there he was.

20:04.942 --> 20:09.773
This sweet, innocent boy,

20:09.773 --> 20:14.996
just laying there, broken.

20:14.996 --> 20:18.217
His neck was bulging in a way
it was...

20:22.830 --> 20:26.747
And I could see,
in his pocket...

20:26.747 --> 20:28.618
the candy bar.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.497
"He'll be fine."

20:37.497 --> 20:39.716
That's what the father said.
"He'll be fine."

20:41.065 --> 20:43.938
It was the way he said it.

20:43.938 --> 20:45.548
Sounded indignant.

20:49.030 --> 20:53.339
The next thing I knew,
I was on top of him,

20:53.339 --> 20:56.080
smashing his face
as hard as I could.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.996
I couldn't stop.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.998
I just kept hitting
him over and over again.

21:00.998 --> 21:03.000
I couldn't stop.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.916
Even when I felt the bones
in my hand start to break,

21:05.916 --> 21:06.830
I couldn't stop.

21:10.399 --> 21:14.316
I was the one
who was supposed to listen.

21:14.316 --> 21:18.189
I was the one who was
supposed to defend the
defenseless.

21:18.189 --> 21:22.237
That sweet little boy came
to me begging for help,

21:22.237 --> 21:24.544
and all I could do was
give him a candy bar.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.548
A fucking candy bar!

21:37.034 --> 21:40.168
The next thing I remember,

21:40.168 --> 21:43.171
I was standing on a bridge,
holding that bottle in my hand.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.912
And it was the first time
in my life

21:44.912 --> 21:46.566
that I heard the voice of God.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.396
He told me to get
back in the car,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.572
that there was another
path for me to follow.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.402
So I did.

21:56.402 --> 21:57.925
I got back in the car
and I drove,

21:57.925 --> 21:59.709
and two hours later, I was here.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.021
Why are you
telling me all this now?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.809
Because I have Sara tied up in
the basement of the church.

22:15.290 --> 22:17.597
Look, I've always known that
there's a reason we're here,

22:17.597 --> 22:19.207
that there's a path
we're meant to follow,

22:19.207 --> 22:20.208
and I know it may seem

22:21.905 --> 22:23.864
Tell me you're joking.

22:23.864 --> 22:25.344
Boyd

22:25.344 --> 22:27.041
Tell me you are
motherfucking joking!

22:27.041 --> 22:28.695
Are you gonna shoot me?

22:28.695 --> 22:30.261
I might fucking shoot you, yeah!

22:30.261 --> 22:32.394
You told me that
Frank broke the rules.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.265
Frank had to
go in the box!

22:34.265 --> 22:36.485
And now you just
that girl

22:36.485 --> 22:38.618
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.403
That girl...

22:41.403 --> 22:43.753
may be the way we all go home.

22:45.233 --> 22:48.018
Keep talking.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.411
Okay.

23:04.992 --> 23:06.036
Jasmine.

23:08.822 --> 23:10.084
Jasmine!

23:10.084 --> 23:11.564
What's wrong?

23:12.913 --> 23:15.176
I only came to
say goodbye.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.047
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

23:17.047 --> 23:20.660
I don't understand.
Just please talk to me.

23:23.184 --> 23:24.881
Why won't you let me in?

23:31.975 --> 23:35.588
You know why. I can't.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.981
Please,
just stay and talk with me.

23:37.981 --> 23:40.070
You said you liked me.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.246
I do!

23:42.246 --> 23:44.553
I can't keep coming here,

23:44.553 --> 23:47.991
knowing I'll see you
but never get to feel you,

23:47.991 --> 23:51.255
knowing you're afraid of me,

23:51.255 --> 23:53.083
that you're disgusted by me.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.998
No. It

23:54.998 --> 23:57.261
You always tell me
how lonely you are in there.

23:57.261 --> 24:00.221
You have no idea
how lonely it is out here.

24:02.397 --> 24:04.791
It wasn't my choice
to be this way.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.229
Goodbye, Kevin.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.057
Wait, wait.

24:13.364 --> 24:17.456
You know, there's a party
going on downstairs.

24:17.456 --> 24:21.155
Everyone's having
a really good time.

24:21.155 --> 24:23.418
But you are the only one
that I want to be with.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.986
You are the only one
that I can really talk to.

24:31.731 --> 24:35.909
You promise it'll just be you?
No one else can get in?

24:35.909 --> 24:39.826
Not once we shut the window,
I promise.

24:43.046 --> 24:43.917
Okay.

24:55.145 --> 24:58.018
And now,
the question is...

25:01.238 --> 25:03.763
...how many
dimensions are there?

25:03.763 --> 25:07.723
Bosonic string theorists believe
there are 26 dimensions,

25:07.723 --> 25:10.857
but superstring theorists
say there's only 10.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.424
And is that what this
place is? Another dimension?

25:13.424 --> 25:14.774
Oh, no, no.

25:14.774 --> 25:17.080
This is a pocket universe.

25:17.080 --> 25:18.038
Oh, my God.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.258
For Christ's sake, man, enough.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.175
It's not a
pocket universe;

25:25.175 --> 25:26.525
it's not whatever
the fuck you think it is,

25:26.525 --> 25:28.222
and nobody gives a fuck.

25:28.222 --> 25:30.529
So why don't you
shut the fuck up, man?

25:30.529 --> 25:34.228
Yeah, okay, have another drink.

25:34.228 --> 25:36.796
All right, calm down.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.363
-Jesus!

25:39.363 --> 25:41.148
Hey!

25:41.148 --> 25:42.279
What are you
gonna do about it? Huh?

25:42.279 --> 25:43.193
-Hey!
-What are you gonna do?

25:43.193 --> 25:45.500
All right, okay.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.763
Take him upstairs before he
starts shooting up the place.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.595
-No, no, no, no!
-Hey, hey, hey! That's enough.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.336
That's enough!
Now, ease up!

25:57.599 --> 25:59.427
You okay?

25:59.427 --> 26:01.037
Hey, you okay?

26:05.128 --> 26:09.524
Yeah, I'm sorry. I, um

26:09.524 --> 26:11.265
I'm just gonna go
upstairs and lay down.

26:11.265 --> 26:12.658
Okay.
I'll come with you.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.661
Nah, it's fine. It's fine.
Hey, I'm just, uh...

26:19.186 --> 26:21.884
It's your night.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.190
Just stay.

26:31.198 --> 26:33.504
Goddamn animal.

26:33.504 --> 26:35.115
Like mother, like son.

26:39.772 --> 26:43.079
You stay the fuck
outta my sight.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.786
Now, close the window, quick.

27:01.663 --> 27:05.493
See?
Just the two of us.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.147
Just the two of us.

27:10.454 --> 27:12.456
My handsome boy.

27:12.456 --> 27:15.459
Your hands are so warm.

27:15.459 --> 27:17.113
Did you think
they would be cold?

27:20.508 --> 27:21.901
Kiss me.

27:39.353 --> 27:47.274
♪

28:00.374 --> 28:01.331
What?

28:03.420 --> 28:05.292
Dinner's ready.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.773
I'm not hungry.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.339
You've been staring
at that book

28:09.339 --> 28:10.819
for a day and a half,
maybe you should

28:10.819 --> 28:12.516
Just fuck off.
Just fuck off.

28:12.516 --> 28:13.474
You know what, Jade?

28:17.217 --> 28:18.435
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

28:18.435 --> 28:21.612
I'm coming! Jesus!

28:21.612 --> 28:25.268
Uh, I wouldn't take too long
if I were you.

28:38.934 --> 28:40.719
You know, you should really
work on your party face.

28:43.025 --> 28:45.027
What are you doing,
sitting here all by yourself?

28:47.247 --> 28:50.293
You don't have to.

28:50.293 --> 28:53.253
I know you don't like me.

28:53.253 --> 28:54.210
That's not true.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.563
I just...

28:59.563 --> 29:01.783
It's such a nice party.

29:01.783 --> 29:04.307
You'll get one too.

29:05.569 --> 29:08.311
No.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.443
I don't think I will.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.368
Take off your shirt.

29:21.368 --> 29:23.718
What?

29:23.718 --> 29:26.155
I'm not gonna lie.
You drive me crazy sometimes.

29:28.462 --> 29:30.029
But we're in
this together.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.209
You're not alone.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.124
Really?

29:43.694 --> 29:46.785
Think of it as an early gift
for your anniversary.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.746
You know what?

29:51.746 --> 29:54.662
Much as I hate to admit,
it looks better on you.

29:54.662 --> 29:57.447
That's wildly untrue.

29:59.319 --> 30:00.973
But thank you.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.197
I'm gonna find something
to give you, too.

30:11.766 --> 30:14.595
Excuse me.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.118
That was nice of you.

30:18.294 --> 30:22.081
Everybody needs a little
pick-me-up sometimes.

30:23.386 --> 30:26.302
Can I ask you something?

30:26.302 --> 30:28.304
Sure.

30:28.304 --> 30:31.742
Uh, that girl that you
that you kissed before?

30:31.742 --> 30:34.833
Who? Stacey?
Yeah, she's great.

30:34.833 --> 30:38.967
Yeah, I'm just I thought you
and Ellis were... together.

30:38.967 --> 30:40.839
Oh.
Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, no.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.971
Ellis, he's he's my person.

30:42.971 --> 30:46.366
That thing with Stacey, that's
just, you know, fooling around.

30:48.455 --> 30:50.152
Oh, okay.

30:52.067 --> 30:54.374
Do you think...

30:55.810 --> 30:57.507
Could I kiss you?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.771
Oh, um, Julie...

31:00.771 --> 31:03.513
No. I was I was just kidding.
I didn't mean

31:03.513 --> 31:04.863
No, sweetie

31:04.863 --> 31:06.255
No, you know what?
Just forget it.

31:11.217 --> 31:14.394
So, this girl tells you she's
hearing voices and you just

31:14.394 --> 31:17.179
Look, I was skeptical.
Just like you, okay?

31:18.702 --> 31:21.923
But then...

31:21.923 --> 31:24.404
she showed me this.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.145
Look at that.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.625
That's the logo

31:28.625 --> 31:29.844
I know what it is.

31:29.844 --> 31:31.759
That was almost
three years ago.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.675
Sara and Nathan have been here,
what? Four, five months?

31:34.675 --> 31:37.591
All right, so you told someone,
someone told Sara

31:37.591 --> 31:39.158
I never told a soul.

31:39.158 --> 31:43.989
Boyd, there was no possible way
she could have known.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.686
Something was
watching me that day,

31:45.686 --> 31:47.775
the same thing that told Sara

31:47.775 --> 31:49.995
And you think this thing
is trying to help us?

31:49.995 --> 31:52.911
By killing an old man
and a child?

31:52.911 --> 31:57.132
Whatever it is, it's a part
of the fabric of this place.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.047
Okay?
Whatever connection Sara has

31:59.047 --> 32:01.876
makes her valuable in ways
we may not even understand yet.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.922
Okay, now if you want to put
her in the box, that's fine.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.924
I'm not gonna stop you.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.753
But if you're serious
about finding answers -
