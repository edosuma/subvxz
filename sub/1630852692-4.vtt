WEBVTT

00:06.674 --> 00:08.592
You've ruined
our banquet,

00:08.592 --> 00:10.511
assaulted political allies,

00:10.511 --> 00:12.888
and risked the security
of the realm.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.640
Throw them in irons!

00:14.640 --> 00:17.935
You heard him. Come with me.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.645
Come.
We did nothing wrong.

00:19.645 --> 00:22.398
Sovereign, it's been
a very long evening.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.942
I will see that they are
properly punished.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.613
See that you do.

00:29.613 --> 00:33.117
Allura, something is
very wrong with Uriel.

00:33.117 --> 00:35.286
He's under the Briarwoods'
influence, I can feel it.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.830
That is a considerable
accusation.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.582
Do you have proof?

00:39.582 --> 00:41.542
No. But I can get it.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.502
I just need time
and access to...

00:43.502 --> 00:45.171
Emon owes you a debt,

00:45.171 --> 00:47.840
but that does not mean
you are above the law.

00:47.840 --> 00:52.470
Though perhaps
Uriel is being too brash.

00:52.470 --> 00:54.930
Until this is resolved,
you are hereby confined

00:54.930 --> 00:57.558
to your keep under house arrest.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.145
How can you arrest a house?

01:01.145 --> 01:03.522
Okay. Thank you, Lady Allura.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.192
I'll convene
a formal inquiry at once.

01:06.192 --> 01:07.860
Your fate will be determined

01:07.860 --> 01:10.821
once we hear the Briarwoods'
side of the story.

01:10.821 --> 01:13.491
If they'll even speak
to us anymore.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.210
Sylas, stop!

01:30.216 --> 01:31.801
My book. They have my book!

01:33.677 --> 01:36.388
A minor inconvenience, my love.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.432
But that tome contains
details of our...

01:38.432 --> 01:40.476
It will avail them of nothing.

01:40.476 --> 01:44.939
Besides, we have the means
of retrieving it, don't we?

02:59.889 --> 03:01.599
Get your filthy hands
off my instrument!

03:01.599 --> 03:04.685
The more you resist,
the longer this will take.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.228
Come on, man.
It's not a weapon!

03:06.228 --> 03:07.688
I just want
to serenade the group!

03:07.688 --> 03:09.857
Then you're doing us a favor.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.735
Your belongings will be returned
if you are exonerated.

03:12.735 --> 03:15.946
All points of egress to this
compound are being surveilled.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.742
If you attempt to escape,
you will be executed.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.744
Are you fucking joking?

03:21.744 --> 03:24.330
I do not joke.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.165
I advise that you sit tight

03:26.165 --> 03:28.375
and wait
for the sovereign's inquiry.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.169
And what, we're just supposed
to sit here?

03:30.169 --> 03:31.962
You have the run of your keep.

03:31.962 --> 03:35.507
I'm sure you will find something
to entertain yourselves.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.563
Come on. Yup.

03:53.651 --> 03:55.277
Getting there.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.404
Slow.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.782
- Feeling good.
- Grog!

03:59.782 --> 04:01.325
- What?
- I know we have a lot to talk about,

04:01.325 --> 04:04.161
but I'm not turning
into a vampire, am I?

04:06.956 --> 04:08.415
I withdraw the question.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.209
So what are we waiting for?

04:10.209 --> 04:13.295
Let's fuck up these guards
and bust out of here.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.631
Oh? So you'd like
to be fugitives of the crown,

04:15.631 --> 04:17.549
wanted in every corner
of Tal'Dorei?

04:17.549 --> 04:19.218
If Uriel is under a charm,

04:19.218 --> 04:21.512
maybe Pike has a spell
that can cure him.

04:23.514 --> 04:26.100
Um, Pike?

04:26.100 --> 04:28.018
Where'd you go?

04:28.018 --> 04:29.561
Huh?

04:29.561 --> 04:32.398
Oh, um, I-I don't know.

04:32.398 --> 04:34.775
W-What she said.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.193
Screw all that.

04:36.193 --> 04:37.987
We should focus on this book.

04:37.987 --> 04:40.155
dead bodies, wolves.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.908
It's some kind
of fucked-up evil diary.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.412
Ooh, maybe it has evidence
that can clear our name.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.163
Oh, really?

04:48.163 --> 04:50.207
You think you can
actually read this thing?

04:50.207 --> 04:53.293
Well, yeah, I mean, I-I only
just started translating it.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.046
And Delilah's handwriting is,
like, the worst but...

04:56.046 --> 04:57.548
Uh-huh. So what does it say?

04:57.548 --> 05:01.135
Oh. Uh, it says "Pyramid,"
"spirits of the dead,"

05:01.135 --> 05:04.471
and right here in tiny letters
it says, "Uh, fuck you, Vax."

05:04.471 --> 05:06.306
Oh, lovely.
Care to translate this?

05:06.306 --> 05:08.767
Oh. Oh, yeah? Oh. Oh, yeah?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.894
- Yeah?
- Can you two stop?

05:14.148 --> 05:16.025
I was using that.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.235
We need to talk.
All of us.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.613
- Percival?
- Certainly.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.283
What would you like
to discuss, Vex'ahlia?

05:24.283 --> 05:27.661
For a start, what the hell
happened back there?

05:27.661 --> 05:29.121
You never thought to mention
that the Briarwoods

05:29.121 --> 05:30.873
- killed your family?
- Oh!

05:30.873 --> 05:33.167
My bad.

05:33.167 --> 05:36.170
I wasn't aware that you were
owed information about my past.

05:36.170 --> 05:39.173
When your past comes to kill us,
I'd say we deserve a heads-up.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.758
And how exactly was I to know

05:40.758 --> 05:42.301
the Briarwoods
would be attending?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.552
I want to know
about the smoke!

05:43.552 --> 05:47.347
Sorry. I... d-d... Loud. Sorry.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.017
Smoke? My weapon
burns black powder.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.977
Perhaps that's what you saw.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.646
What we saw was
you shooting an innocent kid.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.775
No one in the employ
of the Briarwoods is innocent.

05:57.775 --> 05:59.359
The boy knew nothing.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.986
He was terrified!

06:00.986 --> 06:03.530
Slightly more so
after you exploded his hand.

06:05.449 --> 06:07.993
Maybe I got carried away.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.079
But you don't know
the Briarwoods.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.997
What they did to my family.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.917
Then why don't you tell us?

06:16.919 --> 06:19.379
When they arrived in Whitestone,

06:19.379 --> 06:22.049
<i>the Briarwoods came as allies.</i>

06:22.049 --> 06:24.176
<i>But they brought dark ambitions.</i>

06:25.803 --> 06:27.763
<i>And allowed no one
to stand in their way.</i>

06:27.763 --> 06:30.182
<i>Not even children.</i>

06:31.350 --> 06:33.894
<i>They slaughtered us
in cold blood...</i>

06:35.938 --> 06:37.397
<i>- ...seizing my ancestral home.</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:39.233
<i>Even our tutor, the man</i>

06:39.233 --> 06:41.819
<i>my parents entrusted
with our safekeeping</i>

06:41.819 --> 06:44.404
<i>betrayed us.</i>

06:44.404 --> 06:47.825
<i>After enduring weeks of torture,</i>

06:47.825 --> 06:50.160
<i>my sister Cassandra and I tried
to escape together.</i>

06:50.160 --> 06:51.745
<i>- But...</i>

06:57.835 --> 06:59.920
The Briarwoods know
I'm alive now,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.923
and they are not in the habit
of leaving loose ends.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.883
So what's your plan?

07:22.901 --> 07:25.070
I hope this is to your liking.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.698
You take me
to the nicest places.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.670
<i>Vassa Foth. Nel Kaza.</i>

07:47.217 --> 07:49.094
<i>Thrudah klessen foth.</i>

07:49.094 --> 07:52.806
<i>Vassa kaldoa za-kana va.</i>

07:52.806 --> 07:56.518
<i>Veekor-Brama Uth Sa-Ka!</i>

08:00.856 --> 08:02.941
The thing about
an old keep like this...

08:02.941 --> 08:04.985
it's quite easy
to miss small details.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.911
Could do
with some light, Pickle.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.372
You okay, Pikey?

08:17.372 --> 08:19.750
Yeah, I-I'm fine.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.628
Keyleth, uh, can't you
give us a little sunlight?

08:22.628 --> 08:25.756
Me? I-I don't know.
I've never tried.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.050
I get... Oh, just...

08:28.050 --> 08:29.801
Oh, come on.

08:29.801 --> 08:32.137
Ugh. I can't do it.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.223
Sorry, guys.

08:34.223 --> 08:36.975
Forget it. We're here.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.187
And so are we.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.230
- Whoops.
- Oh, seriously.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.397
Ah, fuck a duck.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.109
Your group clearly

08:46.109 --> 08:49.154
can't be trusted,
so we're separating you,

08:49.154 --> 08:51.031
like children.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.366
No.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.993
- No, don't...
- Grog, it's fine.

08:58.789 --> 09:02.417
Aw, you can't take the cutlery!
What if we get hungry?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.670
Eat a fuckin' sandwich.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.922
Hey, I don't take orders
from you, asshole.

09:06.922 --> 09:09.716
Fine, I'll make a sandwich.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.802
But not because
he told me to.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.430
I shouldn't have
listened to Percy.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.807
He's out of his mind.

09:16.807 --> 09:19.142
Ah, he's certainly
complicated things.

09:19.142 --> 09:21.603
There's a way to make
our situation simpler.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.897
You and I have escaped from worse.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.566
Syngorn. Huh.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.735
- Hmm.
- Ah.

09:30.737 --> 09:34.283
Guards might catch the group,
but not you and me.

09:34.283 --> 09:35.575
True.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.035
We could.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.079
Then why aren't we?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.223
What?

09:58.223 --> 10:01.226
Huh.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.273
Uh.

10:07.441 --> 10:08.775
Is someone there?

10:15.657 --> 10:18.577
Oh.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.204
Come on.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.919
Everlight?

10:36.219 --> 10:38.138
Everlight.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.392
Are you there?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.144
Please?

10:48.607 --> 10:50.609
Ah, come on.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.406
Oop. Sorry, Pikey.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.241
You always talk in your sleep?

10:58.241 --> 11:01.912
Uh, I... I was meditating.

11:01.912 --> 11:04.373
Trying to, anyway.

11:04.373 --> 11:08.126
Mm. God, I wish
we had some grub.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.212
Got to be something here.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.173
No.

11:14.633 --> 11:17.052
Ooh, what's this powder?

11:17.052 --> 11:19.096
Herbs and spices?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.847
The ashes of my ancestors.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.434
Right.

11:26.269 --> 11:30.607
Oh, hey, do you use this
to talk to your goddess?

11:30.607 --> 11:33.110
Hello? This thing on?

11:33.110 --> 11:35.070
Am I talking in the wrong end?

11:36.321 --> 11:37.989
Um...

11:37.989 --> 11:39.366
Pike?

11:39.366 --> 11:42.494
After that spell hit me, the...

11:42.494 --> 11:45.705
the Everlight, i-it's like
she can't hear me anymore.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.873
Oh.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.209
Well, I mean,
when people can't hear me,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.545
I just shout louder.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.673
Um...

11:54.673 --> 11:56.383
you try that?

11:56.383 --> 11:58.427
I don't know, Grog.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.095
I don't know anymore.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.348
Oh. Well,
do you think she's mad at you?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.308
I mean, maybe...

12:05.308 --> 12:07.644
maybe you should just say sorry.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.533
Huh?

12:23.118 --> 12:25.745
Hmm?

12:25.745 --> 12:28.790
Hey. Did you see something?

12:28.790 --> 12:29.958
Huh?

12:32.961 --> 12:34.754
Hmm? Hey.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.965
W-What the...?

12:49.019 --> 12:50.562
Captain Jarett!

12:56.359 --> 12:58.737
So...

12:58.737 --> 13:01.198
Just you and me in here.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.785
Uriel was mad, huh?

13:05.785 --> 13:08.288
We didn't ruin
his entire dinner. Just dessert.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.085
Didn't know about your past.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.963
But I guess none of us ever
share that kind of stuff, huh?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.929
I may never see my family again.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.307
What?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.893
Yeah. My Aramenté.

13:29.893 --> 13:32.771
I don't get to go home
until I complete it

13:32.771 --> 13:36.650
and prove myself worthy.

13:36.650 --> 13:40.070
Which might not happen, so...

13:40.070 --> 13:42.239
- I didn't know that.
- I'm just saying,

13:42.239 --> 13:44.241
I know you think you're alone.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.327
That we don't know
what you're going through.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.704
But you don't have to be.

13:51.206 --> 13:55.669
I appreciate that,
Keyleth, truly.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.756
And for the record,
I think you're damn worthy.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.217
But there's a world of difference

14:02.217 --> 14:03.927
between your struggle and mine.

14:03.927 --> 14:06.263
Whether you succeed or fail,

14:06.263 --> 14:09.391
your family is still alive.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.977
Captain,
something in the courtyard.

14:11.977 --> 14:13.687
Outside, now.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.356
Lieutenant, with me. Quickly.

14:21.111 --> 14:23.029
Where have the guards gone?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.031
Fan out.

14:27.701 --> 14:31.496
Hey, what's the fuss, boy?
Nothing's out here.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.133
Damn.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.635
That doesn't sound good.
We better warn the others.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.763
It's locked.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.266
I don't want
to wreck your shrine.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.603
- Grog, do your Grog thing.
- You got it.

14:56.479 --> 14:59.482
Aww. Ugh.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.527
Everybody up!

15:02.527 --> 15:04.487
Creepy shit incoming.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.160
- What's happening?
- Where have the guards gone?

15:12.037 --> 15:13.538
What did you do?

15:13.538 --> 15:16.916
D-Don't look at me.
All I did was make a hoagie.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.835
Five of my men are dead.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.963
If you didn't kill them,
who did?

15:26.718 --> 15:28.637
Uh...

15:31.806 --> 15:33.308
Chancing a guess it was them.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.071
Scanlan!

15:46.071 --> 15:47.447
They want the book.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.330
Keyleth, heads up!

16:08.259 --> 16:09.260
Scanlan!

16:12.305 --> 16:14.182
- Damn it.
- I got him.

16:16.101 --> 16:17.185
Fall back!

16:23.316 --> 16:26.403
Aw, that sucked.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.369
We need a way to fight them.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.246
No use in you being
unarmed anymore.

16:38.373 --> 16:40.041
A trigger? Ew.

16:40.041 --> 16:43.044
I could really
use my lute about now.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.337
I thought you said
it wasn't a weapon.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.089
Obvious lie.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.383
Not that any of these
will do fuck all.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.477
Keyleth!

17:07.318 --> 17:10.572
Why can't I hit you?

17:14.909 --> 17:17.162
Hang on, buddy!

17:21.082 --> 17:23.168
You creepy fuck!

17:30.508 --> 17:32.177
Can't see shit.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.687
Oh! The light!

17:42.687 --> 17:44.189
Yeah, be a great time
to make some more.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.611
I can't.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.784
Pike?

17:55.784 --> 17:57.535
I said I can't!

18:06.336 --> 18:08.213
Keyleth, it's time.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.756
Prove yourself.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.084
Now!

19:35.800 --> 19:37.969
Where did those
foul things come from?

19:37.969 --> 19:40.471
We told you. The Briarwoods.

19:40.471 --> 19:43.683
And they'll no doubt send more.
We can't stay.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.816
Don't make us fight you, too.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.236
You intend to stop those
that did this to my men?

19:56.279 --> 19:58.031
You have my word.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.869
Then go.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.372
Give them hell.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.792
And wish me luck trying
to explain all this.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.721
No goodbye?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.349
I'm going to Whitestone.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.184
And so are we.

20:26.184 --> 20:29.395
If we beat Sylas,
his charm on Uriel will fade.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.481
And we can clear our names.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.151
Honestly, I wouldn't last a day
in prison with this face.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.403
Look at me, I'm a snack.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.490
We're all with you, but...

20:40.490 --> 20:42.867
no more secrets, all right?

20:42.867 --> 20:45.119
Understood.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.038
Thank you.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.748
All of you.

20:52.710 --> 20:56.214
Trinket. Hi, buddy.

20:58.341 --> 20:59.884
Oh, I know, darling.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.762
But you'll be safer here
at the keep.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.973
We'll be back soon.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.017
Told you guys
this book was a big deal,

21:08.017 --> 21:10.436
not that anyone
ever listens to me.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.230
Eh, what do you want now?

21:12.230 --> 21:14.148
Careful where
you aim that thing.

21:14.148 --> 21:16.067
Huh. See what I mean?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.069
A snack.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.744
Very well. To Whitestone.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.915
We should probably
get some supplies, huh?

21:30.915 --> 21:32.250
I can make
a run to Gilmore's.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.751
Not without me
to negotiate.

21:33.751 --> 21:34.961
I'm not going.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.296
Wh... what do you mean?

21:38.923 --> 21:41.134
I can't hear the Everlight.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.803
It's like you said, Grog.

21:43.803 --> 21:47.181
I think I need
to tell her sorry.

21:47.181 --> 21:48.933
Properly, at a temple.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.977
Well, I'll come with you.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.814
Like old times, just you and me.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.900
I have to do this alone, buddy.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.902
And they need you.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.031
Oh, but...

22:03.031 --> 22:05.283
what if I need you?

22:09.037 --> 22:11.205
You can always talk to me.

22:11.205 --> 22:16.335
Even if I'm not around,
you'll feel me there with you.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.474
You're their light now.
