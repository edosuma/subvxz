01:00.638 --> 01:03.608
Hello?! Is anyone in there?

01:04.408 --> 01:08.311
Oh, thank God! Let me in!
Please let me in!

01:10.781 --> 01:13.117
Sorry, lady, we just closed.

01:13.217 --> 01:15.119
No, No! Please!

01:35.406 --> 01:38.776
- 911, state your emergency.
- You've got to help me!

01:38.876 --> 01:40.945
- They took them!
- Took who?

01:41.045 --> 01:46.083
My boys! Oh, God.
We were just here, and they took them!

01:46.183 --> 01:49.654
Ma'am? Ma'am? I need you to calm down
and give me your location.

01:49.754 --> 01:51.255
Can you look around
and tell me what you see?

01:51.355 --> 01:54.458
There's a gas station, on the highway...

02:45.376 --> 02:47.776
What the fuck?

02:57.021 --> 02:58.420
Whoa!

03:23.881 --> 03:27.518
- What the hell's going on?
- Well, we're not sure, boss.

03:27.618 --> 03:30.621
This here is a... weird one.

03:30.721 --> 03:33.424
Store clerk here said a woman,
brunette, like 30,

03:33.524 --> 03:36.060
shows up around midnight,
she's acting irate,

03:36.160 --> 03:39.597
banging on the door here
and wants to use the phone.

03:39.697 --> 03:42.400
- And then...
- Then what?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.501
I think I'll let the boy
tell you himself.

03:47.171 --> 03:50.074
Now, sheriff, I'm not gonna lie to you,

03:50.174 --> 03:53.971
I've done a lot of hallucinogens
in my day,

03:55.173 --> 03:58.028
but what I saw last night,

03:58.128 --> 04:02.186
that shit was out of this world.

04:03.387 --> 04:05.421
Straight up.

04:20.938 --> 04:23.507
Nancy McPherson.

04:24.208 --> 04:26.642
Where did you go?

06:08.445 --> 06:10.948
I know, yeah, I won't forget.

06:11.048 --> 06:14.918
In the garage. Don't worry,
I'm using a wide angle lens.

06:15.819 --> 06:20.157
Never mind. Mom? Ok.

06:20.257 --> 06:23.360
Mom, I gotta go. I'm packing.

06:23.460 --> 06:27.262
Mom, I'm getting off the phone now.
Ok. I love you, too. Bye.

06:28.465 --> 06:33.068
- Mom busting your balls again?
- Yeah, she's driving me fucking nuts.

06:34.538 --> 06:35.706
Are you sure you want to come with me?

06:35.806 --> 06:37.741
I could just take the photos
and come home tonight.

06:37.841 --> 06:40.444
No, I'm coming with you
and it's gonna be great.

06:40.544 --> 06:43.681
It's been a brutal semester, God knows
we both deserve some R and R.

06:43.781 --> 06:45.981
If you say so.

06:47.151 --> 06:51.232
It's gonna be fun. We can go on a hike,

06:51.332 --> 06:56.827
little small campfire,
look up at the stars. And then...

06:57.428 --> 06:59.563
I will make you my bitch.

06:59.963 --> 07:02.566
Or I can be your bitch,
I can be your bitch, too, if you want.

07:02.666 --> 07:04.737
You're already my bitch.

07:08.746 --> 07:10.972
Dad, what do you want?

07:11.742 --> 07:13.844
Hey, April!

07:13.944 --> 07:17.348
- You actually see me over there?
- Hey, dad. Yeah, I can see you.

07:17.448 --> 07:20.117
I can't talk for long, ok?
We're just getting ready to leave.

07:20.217 --> 07:23.854
I still can't believe your mother's
making you go all the way out there.

07:23.954 --> 07:28.158
Couldn't she just have gotten the real estate
agent to take the damn photos?

07:28.258 --> 07:30.728
I don't know, she said it was gonna
cost too much. You know mom.

07:30.828 --> 07:36.333
Cheapest woman I ever met. She's just
selling it to spite me, you know that right?

07:36.433 --> 07:39.536
As if getting the goddamn house
wasn't enough.

07:39.636 --> 07:42.573
Dad, are you drinking?
It's like eleven in the morning.

07:42.673 --> 07:48.045
You know what they say, the only cure
for a hangover is to keep it coming.

07:48.145 --> 07:52.449
Dad, seriously. Slow down.
I worry about you.

07:52.549 --> 07:55.119
Did you catch the game last night?

07:55.219 --> 07:58.555
Dad, I really can't talk for long,
we're, like, almost out the door.

07:58.655 --> 08:00.558
Well, wait, wait. I...

08:00.658 --> 08:03.660
I need you to grab some things
for me while you're out there.

08:04.403 --> 08:08.032
Two fishing rods in the garage,
and a tackle box.

08:08.132 --> 08:10.134
You'll find it behind the work bench.

08:10.234 --> 08:13.455
Ok, fishing rods, tackle box. Got it.

08:13.555 --> 08:18.876
Oh... and my shotgun. The double barrel.
It's in the basement.

08:18.976 --> 08:23.447
If your mother wants that, she's gonna have
to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.

08:23.547 --> 08:28.052
Got it. One shotgun, dead hands.
Ok, dad, I'm gonna go now, ok?

08:28.152 --> 08:30.421
I love you, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

08:30.521 --> 08:33.390
Ok, how do I turn off...

08:34.491 --> 08:36.760
I feel like I'm seventeen
all over again.

08:36.860 --> 08:39.563
Did your dad find a new job yet?

08:39.863 --> 08:43.667
He's been looking,
but he's not in very good shape.

08:45.536 --> 08:47.605
Jesus, what now?

08:48.505 --> 08:49.974
- Hello?
- Yo, bitch!

08:50.074 --> 08:52.375
Are we doing this shit, or what?

08:52.976 --> 08:56.580
- We'll be down in a sec, chill.
- Well, it's hot as fuck down here, Kyle,

08:56.680 --> 08:59.516
my balls are sweating
like a motherfucker. Let's go!

08:59.616 --> 09:01.051
Who is that, is that Seth?

09:01.151 --> 09:03.187
Ok, I probably should have
told you this earlier,

09:03.287 --> 09:08.758
but I might have invited a few people
to come with us to the cabin.

09:09.359 --> 09:13.161
- Kyle, seriously?
- April!

09:15.199 --> 09:18.001
- Hey, Mel.
- Come on, April, let's do this shit!

09:18.101 --> 09:22.270
Time is money.
I got places to go, people to see.

09:25.509 --> 09:27.678
It's gonna be fun, I promise.

09:27.778 --> 09:32.815
Oh, yeah, hey April, can I come upstairs
real quick? I gotta take a fat shit.

09:33.116 --> 09:35.352
I so hate you right now.

09:52.102 --> 09:54.571
- Come on, come on!
- Seth, watch it!

09:55.706 --> 09:57.572
Watch this shit!

09:58.839 --> 10:01.019
Motherfucker!

10:01.612 --> 10:03.447
Don't fucking do that again.

10:03.547 --> 10:06.817
Don't be such a fuckin' pussy, man.
There's nobody on the road!

10:08.685 --> 10:11.552
- Oh, fuck.
- If he searches us, we're fucked.

10:24.201 --> 10:25.553
I gotta tell you,

10:25.653 --> 10:29.573
that is pretty high on the list of
stupidest things I've ever seen in my life.

10:29.673 --> 10:32.676
Yeah, I'm really sorry,
officer. I'm an idiot.

10:32.776 --> 10:36.079
I'm glad you're aware of it.
License and registration.

10:36.179 --> 10:37.997
Yeah...

10:39.349 --> 10:40.884
Where you kids headed?

10:40.984 --> 10:44.021
My mom owns a cabin out here.
We're just staying at it for the weekend.

10:44.121 --> 10:48.025
Well, we've had some
disturbances around here...

10:48.125 --> 10:51.228
some break-ins, vandalism,
animals being killed.

10:51.328 --> 10:54.097
Obviously, you kids wouldn't know
anything about that, would you?

10:54.197 --> 10:56.066
No, nothing. We just got here.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.802
- You're just visiting.
- Yes.

10:58.902 --> 11:03.307
See, we get a lot of that. Kids coming down
for the weekend, getting drunk,

11:03.407 --> 11:07.311
thinking they can do whatever they want.
I'm here to tell you that's not the case.

11:07.411 --> 11:09.646
While you're in my town you best behave,

11:09.746 --> 11:12.082
or you're gonna have to deal
with me and you don't want to do that.

11:12.182 --> 11:15.351
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

11:15.852 --> 11:18.655
- I'm gonna give you a warning.
- Thank you.

11:19.656 --> 11:22.293
No more fuckin' around. Got it?

11:22.393 --> 11:25.527
Yes, thank you.
We're not gonna be a problem.

11:27.764 --> 11:29.764
Yep.

11:30.701 --> 11:33.068
Remind me to punch you
in the dick, Seth.

11:43.013 --> 11:46.283
Wow, this is amazing!

11:46.383 --> 11:48.552
It's beautiful out here.

11:48.852 --> 11:50.830
Yeah, April,
when you said cabin in the woods

11:50.930 --> 11:53.922
I thought this
was gonna be a total shithole.

12:05.035 --> 12:08.705
Oh, yeah! Fuckin' A!

12:08.805 --> 12:11.472
This is what I'm talkin' about!

12:12.076 --> 12:14.642
This is such a trip.

12:15.712 --> 12:19.015
Last time I was here,
we were in middle school.

12:19.316 --> 12:21.257
Yeah.

12:22.159 --> 12:25.223
We used to come out here every summer.

12:26.023 --> 12:28.169
I'm gonna go grab my camera,
hopefully I can get all the rooms

12:28.269 --> 12:30.060
- before it gets dark out.
- Do you need any help?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.062
- No, it's ok baby, I got it.
- Alright.

12:32.162 --> 12:34.102
Hey, think fast, fuckhead!

12:36.633 --> 12:38.766
Bottoms up, motherfuckers!

13:11.468 --> 13:14.137
I figured it was coyotes,
so I replaced the whole damn fence.

13:14.237 --> 13:16.773
Now I don't know what to think.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.122
Well...

13:20.444 --> 13:25.315
it doesn't look like coyotes, Rick.
It's too perfect, too clean.

13:25.415 --> 13:27.784
If this keeps up,
I'm not gonna survive the season.

13:27.884 --> 13:33.556
I'm gonna get animal control down here,
get things cleared up, ok? You take care.

13:41.698 --> 13:46.182
I'm over here at the Riseman farm,
got another animal mutilation

13:46.282 --> 13:49.938
- same as the others.
- Copy that, sheriff.

14:00.717 --> 14:03.685
What the hell is going on in this town?

14:04.354 --> 14:05.505
- No.
- Yeah.

14:05.605 --> 14:07.157
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you slept with that guy.

14:07.257 --> 14:08.225
- Yeah.
- No!

14:08.325 --> 14:11.094
- Yeah!
- He was, like, forty and so guido!

14:11.194 --> 14:15.599
Oh, whatever. He was hot.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.402
So...

14:18.502 --> 14:22.005
NYU probably has a pretty
good writing program.

14:22.305 --> 14:25.575
You know, it would probably
be easy to transfer there.

14:25.675 --> 14:27.266
- What?
- For Kyle.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.211
If he wanted to go with you.

14:29.311 --> 14:32.816
Melanie, I put a lot of thought into this, ok?
I just don't see it happening.

14:32.916 --> 14:37.558
I don't know, it's just that there are
a lot of douchebag guys out there,

14:37.658 --> 14:39.756
and Kyle isn't one of them.

14:39.856 --> 14:43.159
- You guys are great together.
- I know we are, I just...

14:43.381 --> 14:45.747
I don't want to be one of those girls
that marries her high school sweetheart

14:45.847 --> 14:48.532
and then pops out three kids
and wonders what could have been.

14:48.632 --> 14:51.034
Look, all I'm saying is that, you know,

14:51.134 --> 14:53.971
maybe you should just think
about it a little bit more.

14:56.807 --> 15:01.511
What? What is it? What the fuck?
What the fuck's your problem?

15:02.741 --> 15:04.281
Rusty, stop being so aggro.

15:05.481 --> 15:07.451
Fucking... Rusty, come back here!

15:07.551 --> 15:10.353
- Rusty!
- Fucking dumb dog.

15:10.453 --> 15:12.320
Rusty!

15:21.965 --> 15:25.535
Fuck. I think he's back there.

15:25.835 --> 15:28.005
Rusty!

15:28.405 --> 15:30.438
Rusty!

15:37.047 --> 15:38.880
Really, Mel?

15:41.584 --> 15:45.153
Don't be a square. Come on.

15:54.497 --> 15:58.702
Wow. What a shithole.

16:00.003 --> 16:02.639
Fuck, I think he's back there.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.446
Holy shit, Melanie, look.

16:13.650 --> 16:16.586
Oh, my God.

16:16.686 --> 16:18.653
Score!

16:25.262 --> 16:27.697
Thank you, God, thank you, God.

16:27.997 --> 16:30.467
Ok, remember,
we're here to find the dog.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.767
What dog?

16:36.714 --> 16:38.152
Oh.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.850
Sweet Jesus, it's a miracle!

16:46.950 --> 16:48.752
Melanie, put it down.
Come on. This is sketch.

16:48.852 --> 16:50.854
It's probably some drug dealer's stash.

16:50.954 --> 16:54.989
- Can I just take one bag?
- No! I don't wanna get killed!

16:57.127 --> 16:59.263
Ok, fine. Fine.

17:01.364 --> 17:03.733
There you are! Don't do that again.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.603
Come on, let's go ok? Oh, my God!

17:07.203 --> 17:09.356
What are you doing on my property?

17:09.455 --> 17:11.040
We weren't trying
to steal anything, I promise!

17:11.141 --> 17:12.342
You're trespassing!

17:12.442 --> 17:15.278
No, no, no, my dog just ran back here
and we came back to get him!

17:15.578 --> 17:18.381
Who sent you? Who sent you?

17:18.481 --> 17:21.182
My parents own a cabin
right down the road!

17:25.221 --> 17:26.573
April?

17:28.491 --> 17:30.627
I know you?

17:30.827 --> 17:34.929
Hell, I haven't seen you since you
were knee high to a bait pail.

17:37.066 --> 17:40.270
Remember? Your dad and I
used to take you fishing out on the lake!

17:40.370 --> 17:42.505
- Travis?
- Yeah!

17:51.047 --> 17:55.952
Sorry for spookin' you guys back there,
I don't get many visitors.

17:56.252 --> 18:01.622
I see somebody on my property,
they're usually here lookin' for trouble.

18:04.094 --> 18:05.762
Is this you?

18:06.863 --> 18:11.300
Oh, yeah, a little green
behind the ears in that one.

18:11.901 --> 18:15.972
So... were you in, like,
Vietnam or whatever?

18:18.908 --> 18:21.811
'67 through '71.

18:22.012 --> 18:23.680
Brave as shit.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.208
I've seen things...

18:27.517 --> 18:30.988
things your generation
just wouldn't understand.

18:31.688 --> 18:33.924
Hey, what's that thing?

18:38.027 --> 18:42.032
My motion activated thermal cameras
picked this one up last week.

18:42.132 --> 18:43.934
What is it?

18:44.034 --> 18:46.436
What do you think it is?
Secret military air craft!

18:46.536 --> 18:50.774
They've been using this whole area for test
flying ever since the end of the Cold War.

18:50.874 --> 18:52.876
Maybe things have been heating up.

18:53.176 --> 18:57.703
Just last night I tracked one of these babies
going about 2400 clicks an hour,

18:57.803 --> 19:02.852
it stopped right on a goddamn dime, did a 180
quicker than any aircraft known to man.

19:03.353 --> 19:04.487
You had to see it.

19:04.587 --> 19:07.422
- No way!
- Way.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.875
Oh, you guys are so young,

19:11.975 --> 19:15.565
you have no idea
what's going on out there.

19:15.965 --> 19:18.034
Why should you?

19:18.835 --> 19:20.904
When I was your age,

19:21.004 --> 19:26.142
I thought the world was...
a good and fair place.

19:26.843 --> 19:29.410
I've seen some shit since then.

19:30.547 --> 19:34.865
People nowadays live in their naive,
comfortable bubble worlds,

19:34.965 --> 19:38.154
and the men behind the curtain
want to keep them that way.

19:38.254 --> 19:42.957
The last thing they want is an informed,
public cable free-thought.

19:44.394 --> 19:46.596
Free. Yeah.

19:46.696 --> 19:50.266
People out there, they think they're free,
but they couldn't be further from the truth.

19:50.366 --> 19:54.936
That's why you gotta stay off the radar.
Keep off the grid.

19:59.175 --> 20:04.683
'Cause they're out there,
and they're watching.

20:06.816 --> 20:10.518
So... can I buy some weed?

20:13.923 --> 20:16.092
Of course you can.

20:16.292 --> 20:18.997
So then, I was like "oh, my god."

20:19.097 --> 20:22.233
And I was, like, freaking out and I felt
super dizzy and out of it, and I mean,

20:22.333 --> 20:25.435
I was having a full on panic attack
in the middle of the club!

20:25.535 --> 20:28.605
All of my friends were totally TTYL,
I didn't know what to do.

20:28.705 --> 20:34.010
So anyway, out of nowhere, he comes over
and he's all like "hey, are you alright"?

20:34.110 --> 20:38.715
He takes me to his dorm and he takes care
of me all night and he gives me water

20:38.815 --> 20:41.184
and I just knew he was
the right guy for me.

20:41.284 --> 20:44.385
So yeah, that's how we met.

20:46.256 --> 20:51.292
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- I know, right?

20:52.162 --> 20:55.131
Hey... can I talk to you for a second?

20:55.231 --> 20:59.934
- Just, like, upstairs?
- Yeah, ok, sure.

21:10.446 --> 21:12.713
Actually, could you close the door?

21:13.082 --> 21:16.720
- Are you ok? You're acting really weird.
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

21:17.796 --> 21:19.754
So, I...

21:23.259 --> 21:25.628
I don't know how to say this, really.

21:25.728 --> 21:27.728
Say what?

21:31.134 --> 21:33.703
You know that I care about you
a lot, right?

21:34.003 --> 21:37.473
Yeah, of course I do. What is it?

21:38.074 --> 21:40.326
Ok, here goes.

21:41.944 --> 21:44.052
April...

21:44.454 --> 21:47.484
we know each other inside and out,

21:47.784 --> 21:51.221
and the last three years have been
the best three years of my life.

21:51.321 --> 21:55.356
I love waking up next to you, and...

21:55.456 --> 21:59.362
and I want to keep waking up
next to you for the rest of my life.

21:59.662 --> 22:01.097
So...

22:02.698 --> 22:05.234
What are you doing, Kyle?

22:05.635 --> 22:08.638
April, what do you say?

22:08.738 --> 22:11.275
You want to keep waking up
next to me, too?

22:13.276 --> 22:15.945
Kyle, are you serious?

22:16.045 --> 22:17.914
Is that a yes?

22:19.168 --> 22:21.785
I don't know.

22:22.685 --> 22:24.854
You don't know?

22:25.855 --> 22:27.888
Oh, fuck.

22:32.862 --> 22:35.455
You can't leave me hanging here.

22:43.039 --> 22:45.175
Kyle, I...

22:45.275 --> 22:48.899
- I can't.
- But why?

22:49.712 --> 22:53.214
Fuck, I haven't told you this yet. I...

22:53.714 --> 22:55.852
I didn't want it to be like this.

22:56.152 --> 23:00.056
- I got a job offer in New York.
- New York?

23:00.156 --> 23:02.960
- Yeah.
- When does it start?

23:05.061 --> 23:07.363
The middle of May.

23:08.164 --> 23:11.067
That's like a month away!
When the hell were you gonna tell me this?

23:11.167 --> 23:15.238
This weekend, but then you ended up
inviting a bunch of people over here.

23:15.338 --> 23:19.641
That's right in the middle of the semester,
I can't transfer that quickly.

23:22.812 --> 23:24.214
What, did you not want me
to go with you?

23:24.314 --> 23:26.938
No, Kyle, I didn't say that.
I just... I...

23:27.138 --> 23:29.915
Oh, my God. You're breaking up with me.

23:30.015 --> 23:32.889
No, no Kyle, I just...

23:32.989 --> 23:36.857
I don't know if I'm ever gonna get another
opportunity like this again.

23:38.661 --> 23:41.130
- Oh, I'm such an idiot.
- No, Kyle.

23:41.230 --> 23:44.532
- I'm such a fucking idiot.
- Kyle...

23:46.602 --> 23:48.836
Kyle, don't walk away.

23:49.639 --> 23:52.208
Surprise!

23:52.508 --> 23:54.210
Let's get this motherfucking
party start...

23:54.310 --> 23:56.644
Fuck off, Seth.

23:59.482 --> 24:02.116
- You said no?
- Seth!

24:04.554 --> 24:07.821
That is some cold ass shit.

24:53.369 --> 24:57.173
Welcome to the gayest
surprise party ever!

24:57.673 --> 25:00.023
Not only did the surprise
completely backfire,

25:00.123 --> 25:03.512
but there's no TV,
there's no cell phone service,

25:03.612 --> 25:08.284
and I just got the worst news
that my chick is on the rag.

25:08.384 --> 25:10.253
In this corner we have Kyle,

25:10.353 --> 25:14.157
who has just taken a merciless beating
from April and could be out for the count.

25:14.257 --> 25:17.890
Hey! Say something
for the camera there, champ!

25:20.162 --> 25:21.931
Come here, you fuckin' dumb dog.

25:22.031 --> 25:24.400
Oh, yeah, gimme this shit.

25:25.001 --> 25:27.471
What are these dirty sluts up to?

25:28.671 --> 25:31.674
Fuck, I just wish it didn't have to go down
like that. I fucking care about him.

25:31.774 --> 25:32.675
Are you filming this?

25:32.775 --> 25:36.869
That is some fucked up shit. I mean really,
who says no to a guy on one knee?

25:36.969 --> 25:38.353
Seth, fuck off.

25:38.453 --> 25:40.450
I just, I'm trying to understand
the situation.

25:40.550 --> 25:42.485
- So am I.
- Seth.

25:42.585 --> 25:44.755
I thought we were happy together.

25:44.855 --> 25:49.525
It's "April and Kyle", remember? We're in it
for the long haul. Where you go, I go.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.894
- He fuckin' loves you, April.
- Enough.

25:51.994 --> 25:54.130
Seth, get the fuck out of here.

25:54.230 --> 25:57.133
- I care about you, but...
- But what? But what?

25:57.233 --> 25:59.068
I fucking love you and you love me.

25:59.168 --> 26:02.338
I don't even think I believe
in the concept of marriage, Kyle.

26:02.438 --> 26:05.975
Look how well it turned out for my parents,
they can't stand each other!

26:06.075 --> 26:07.343
But you are the one for me.

26:07.443 --> 26:09.512
Kyle, that is just something
we are raised to believe

26:09.612 --> 26:13.049
that we're supposed to want, ok?
The one, you know?

26:13.149 --> 26:16.352
Like it's some magical fucking thing
that is going to complete us and it's crap!

26:16.452 --> 26:19.155
- Are you listening to me?
- What are you talking about?

26:19.255 --> 26:23.226
I'm saying that at the end of the day,
we're all just alone in the universe.

26:23.826 --> 26:26.662
April, that is the worst
fucking logic...

26:26.762 --> 26:28.477
What the fuck is that?

26:37.507 --> 26:38.807
What the fuck?

26:41.210 --> 26:42.211
Holy fuck!

26:42.660 --> 26:44.745
Oh, my God!

26:47.617 --> 26:50.319
- We gotta go!
- Leave this shit! Let's go!

26:50.419 --> 26:51.421
No way, man!

26:51.521 --> 26:54.590
- What the fuck, April?
- Melanie!

26:54.690 --> 26:55.989
Shit!

26:57.827 --> 26:59.929
What the hell is that?

27:00.029 --> 27:03.332
Are we really fucking doing this shit?

27:04.333 --> 27:10.539
Fuck sakes man, I'm too fucking drunk
for this shit, man.

27:11.140 --> 27:12.975
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

27:13.075 --> 27:14.775
Fuck.

27:17.780 --> 27:18.981
Oh, my God.

27:19.081 --> 27:23.285
- What the hell is that?
- It's an airplane, right?

27:23.385 --> 27:26.622
I don't know, maybe man,
but what's with the red light?

27:26.722 --> 27:29.590
- I don't fuckin' know, man.
- Seth!

27:39.702 --> 27:42.470
Is that what I think it is?

27:50.713 --> 27:54.182
Oh, my God, this is fucked up!

27:55.418 --> 27:57.554
What is this?

27:58.855 --> 28:03.958
I know one thing for sure it's not,
this is definitely not an airplane!

28:10.833 --> 28:12.915
No way.

28:22.478 --> 28:24.781
This is so light, it's like tinfoil.

28:25.781 --> 28:29.252
Do you think it's a military thing
like Travis was saying?

28:29.952 --> 28:33.823
- It has to be.
- Ok, seriously, fuck this!

28:33.923 --> 28:36.859
This is not fucking happening!
I'm going back to the car.

28:36.959 --> 28:39.914
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby,
I'm with you. Yo, yo guys, let's go.

28:41.697 --> 28:43.074
Come on, let's go!

28:43.174 --> 28:46.467
Seth? Look at this!

28:53.743 --> 28:57.011
Yo, yo, yo! Come check this out!

29:00.182 --> 29:02.115
Get over here!

29:04.420 --> 29:05.853
Come on.

29:08.758 --> 29:10.291
Holy shit.

29:20.736 --> 29:22.632
Are those footprints?

29:48.064 --> 29:49.897
Seriously?

29:52.735 --> 29:54.434
Fuck.

29:55.738 --> 29:58.339
Hey, you got the video?
I want to see the video.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.679
I know one thing for sure it's not,

30:03.779 --> 30:06.816
- this is definitely not an airplane!
- This is so fucked!

30:06.916 --> 30:12.288
I knew this shit was real, man.
That fuckin' Roswell Area 51 shit is true.

30:12.388 --> 30:14.624
- No, it's gotta be something else.
- Look at it, for Christ's sake!

30:14.724 --> 30:17.226
It's a UFO! It's a fucking crashed UFO!

30:17.326 --> 30:20.296
I think we should pack our shit
and get the hell out of here, you guys.

30:20.396 --> 30:22.765
Let's just drive until we get reception
and then call someone.

30:22.865 --> 30:25.501
Who the fuck are we gonna call? 911?
They'll think it's a fucking joke.

30:25.601 --> 30:30.638
- I don't know, but we can't just stay here!
- You guys! She's right.

30:32.310 --> 30:34.230
Those footprints...

30:37.680 --> 30:39.915
they were headed in this direction.

30:40.015 --> 30:43.383
Alright, calm down.
Everything is gonna be fine.

30:44.954 --> 30:47.023
You've got to be kidding me!

30:53.329 --> 30:56.365
Ok, guys, it's ok. The power's gone out here
before when the weather was this bad.

30:56.465 --> 31:00.000
- It's probably just the breaker.
- Well, where's the breaker?

31:17.386 --> 31:19.954
Come on, hurry the fuck up.

31:26.161 --> 31:27.825
- Alright, where is it?
- It's over there.

31:27.925 --> 31:29.997
- Where?
- Here.

31:32.067 --> 31:34.434
I think it's the ground line.

31:36.403 --> 31:37.540
Are you ok?!

31:37.640 --> 31:39.008
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, my God.

31:45.781 --> 31:47.714
Oh, shit.

31:55.457 --> 31:58.358
What the fuck is he barking at?

32:08.571 --> 32:11.774
There's someone in the house!

32:12.074 --> 32:15.044
Yeah, or something.

32:15.144 --> 32:19.013
There's a gun. There's a gun down here.

32:25.721 --> 32:27.854
It's unloaded.

32:29.058 --> 32:31.257
Oh, my God, let me do it.

32:34.163 --> 32:36.665
Where did you learn how to do that?

32:36.765 --> 32:38.935
My dad and I used to hunt.

32:46.375 --> 32:49.540
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Rusty!

33:03.692 --> 33:05.459
Come on.

33:16.906 --> 33:18.727
Oh, my God.

33:19.842 --> 33:21.737
Quick, shut it!

33:30.552 --> 33:32.521
Do you see anything?

33:32.621 --> 33:34.121
No.

33:36.391 --> 33:39.092
Is it still in the house?

33:55.010 --> 33:56.877
Oh, shit.

34:02.551 --> 34:04.784
Watch out, watch out, watch out.

34:08.223 --> 34:10.190
Anything up there?

34:16.498 --> 34:18.465
Come on.

34:46.395 --> 34:48.864
You see anything out there?

34:48.964 --> 34:53.619
No. Whatever was in here,
it's definitely gone now.

35:09.918 --> 35:11.919
Oh, my God.

35:14.189 --> 35:15.758
Hello?

35:17.159 --> 35:19.561
Did I just hear a gunshot?

35:37.112 --> 35:38.632
Is that blood?

35:42.351 --> 35:45.385
What the fuck is that?

35:57.266 --> 35:59.134
Jesus.

35:59.234 --> 36:03.460
Dude, that's a dead fuckin' alien.

36:10.312 --> 36:12.588
Kyle, it's cold! Drive faster!

36:12.688 --> 36:15.083
Do you guys realize what we just saw?

36:16.184 --> 36:18.120
I mean, do you realize what this means?

36:18.220 --> 36:19.955
I don't care, I don't care.
I just wanna get home.

36:20.055 --> 36:22.424
No, no, no, we gotta come back
in the morning and take pictures!

36:22.524 --> 36:25.994
- Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?
- Think about it! We're gonna be rich!

36:26.094 --> 36:30.457
We're gonna be on TV and shit! We have
proof that life on another planet exists.

36:30.557 --> 36:33.500
Give it a rest, babe. Fuck!

36:40.642 --> 36:42.475
Kyle, slow down.

36:55.157 --> 36:57.126
Great. Perfect.

36:57.226 --> 37:00.596
- Just drive over it, man.
- It's too big to drive over.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.664
Can't you just, like,
move it or something?

37:02.764 --> 37:07.367
Move it? Look at it.
This thing probably weighs two tons.

37:15.944 --> 37:18.748
Kyle, look at this!

37:26.455 --> 37:28.981
What did this?

37:29.358 --> 37:31.442
Was it lightning?

37:33.929 --> 37:39.466
This is the only road back into town.
What're we gonna do?

37:41.803 --> 37:43.637
Well, at least it stopped raining.

38:15.938 --> 38:17.769
What the hell?

38:22.545 --> 38:24.276
Oh, my God!

38:27.216 --> 38:29.074
Jesus Christ, what the fuck is that?

38:30.252 --> 38:32.421
Get in the car!

38:42.362 --> 38:44.741
I'm getting the fuck out of here!

38:50.372 --> 38:53.874
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get back in the car!

38:56.278 --> 38:58.305
What is she doing? Let's go!

39:17.399 --> 39:18.965
Oh, my God!

39:25.874 --> 39:28.077
Get in the fucking car!

39:39.354 --> 39:41.988
Oh, my God, no!

40:07.216 --> 40:09.482
Oh, my God, no!

40:43.652 --> 40:46.586
Sheriff's department. Open up!

40:49.591 --> 40:51.458
Hello?

41:24.259 --> 41:28.830
We're finally here, at Echo Lake,
it is unbelievably gorgeous,

41:28.930 --> 41:30.632
and it's Matty's first time fishing.

41:30.832 --> 41:34.069
One, two, three, go!

41:34.169 --> 41:36.841
I'm gonna catch a fish
that's even bigger than this!

41:36.941 --> 41:40.139
- Say hi to grandma!
- Hi, grandma!

41:44.947 --> 41:48.541
Live it up, I want to live that dream...

41:49.651 --> 41:52.788
- Oh, my God, what is that?
- Are you filming this?

41:52.888 --> 41:54.654
Honey, is that a plane?

41:55.924 --> 41:58.061
Matty, what are you doing?
Get back in the camper!

41:58.161 --> 42:00.829
Mom, I can see something up there.

42:01.129 --> 42:03.734
- Oh, my God, Matty!
- Jesus! Matty!

42:11.106 --> 42:12.943
Oh, God.

42:23.585 --> 42:25.451
Anybody there?

42:53.548 --> 42:55.115
Don't hurt me!

42:56.218 --> 42:59.722
Ma'am, I am not going to hurt you.

43:00.422 --> 43:02.925
I'm here to protect you.

43:03.325 --> 43:09.264
8732, I'm over here at Dudney Trunk,
I am requesting immediate medical assistance.

43:09.364 --> 43:11.533
10-4 sheriff, we're on our way.

43:11.633 --> 43:15.771
Ma'am, what happened?
Who did this to you?

43:15.971 --> 43:20.642
They took Jeffrey! They took my Matty!

43:21.810 --> 43:24.781
Took them where? Who took them?

43:27.182 --> 43:29.151
Who do you think?

43:35.123 --> 43:38.460
They do tests, experiments.

43:38.560 --> 43:41.263
They want to know everything about us.

43:42.564 --> 43:44.433
They'll show you things.

43:44.533 --> 43:47.937
Put things in your mind.
Terrible things.

43:48.337 --> 43:51.840
Ma'am. You're safe now.

43:53.241 --> 43:54.937
They held me down!

43:58.513 --> 44:00.727
I couldn't stop them.

44:01.917 --> 44:04.419
They held me down.

44:04.519 --> 44:06.553
Oh, God.

44:26.808 --> 44:29.844
Oh, shit. What the fuck?

44:29.944 --> 44:32.581
What the fuck is happening?
What the fuck was that?

44:32.681 --> 44:35.016
They just fucking took her, man!

44:35.116 --> 44:37.719
They just fucking took her!
We are fucking here!

44:37.819 --> 44:39.588
- We're in the middle of fucking nowhere...
- Seth, calm down.

44:39.688 --> 44:41.456
Don't! Just don't touch me, ok?

44:41.556 --> 44:44.226
- I said get the fuck off me!
- What the hell is your problem?

44:45.141 --> 44:48.763
Guys, guys, guys! Stop! Look!

44:48.863 --> 44:51.333
It's Travis's place.

44:51.433 --> 44:54.402
Come on. Let's go.

44:54.503 --> 44:57.639
- Yo, you sure this guy's cool?
- Yeah, he's totally on the level.

44:58.540 --> 45:02.544
Nobody move! Or this one will be dead
before he hits the floor!

45:02.644 --> 45:05.450
Travis, please don't hurt him!
It's just me!

45:06.147 --> 45:07.916
April?

45:08.516 --> 45:11.753
What the hell are you doing,
sneaking up on me?!

45:12.153 --> 45:14.689
We thought you were dead!

45:15.589 --> 45:18.767
No, no. I've been sleeping
with one eye open for years.

45:18.867 --> 45:21.096
Yeah? You want to let go
of me then, please!

45:21.196 --> 45:23.532
Oh, I'm sorry, son.

45:23.832 --> 45:25.630
Old habits die hard.

45:27.869 --> 45:32.947
I was watching the dolphins
and niner's Super Bowl game and...

45:33.708 --> 45:35.811
must have dozed off.

45:36.211 --> 45:39.681
We didn't mean to scare you, we just...

45:39.981 --> 45:42.350
didn't know where else to go.

45:42.450 --> 45:44.951
We're in trouble and need help.

45:46.988 --> 45:48.762
Trouble?

45:50.725 --> 45:53.160
Seth, show him the video.

45:54.996 --> 45:56.699
Video?

45:59.300 --> 46:00.689
What video?

46:00.789 --> 46:03.571
You're gonna want to add this one
to your collection.

46:03.671 --> 46:06.972
This is definitely not an airplane!

46:13.214 --> 46:15.116
Aliens.

46:15.817 --> 46:17.920
I should have known.

46:19.754 --> 46:24.110
See, everyone within the inner circle
knows that the US government

46:24.210 --> 46:28.249
has had a treaty with the extraterrestrials
after since Roswell.

46:28.349 --> 46:32.534
We don't have time
for this conspiracy theory bullshit!

46:32.634 --> 46:34.436
We need to get help! Now!

46:34.536 --> 46:38.038
Seth! Let him talk.

46:43.712 --> 46:46.312
What kind of treaty?

46:47.481 --> 46:48.883
Well...

46:49.183 --> 46:51.643
The powers that be
turn a blind eye to them

46:51.743 --> 46:55.256
abducting civilians and doing
whatever the hell it is they do with them.

46:55.356 --> 47:00.128
And, in turn, we get to run around
down here as if we own the place.

47:00.528 --> 47:03.932
It's a basic simple agreement
with one cardinal rule:

47:04.032 --> 47:07.002
Do not engage. And you...

47:08.172 --> 47:10.138
you engaged.

47:10.238 --> 47:12.474
What do you mean?

47:13.775 --> 47:15.877
Sweetheart, you shot one of them.

47:15.977 --> 47:19.115
Broke the treaty.
Now they're out for blood.

47:20.215 --> 47:21.816
You guys, what does this mean?

47:39.968 --> 47:41.734
It's them.

47:51.012 --> 47:54.477
It's gone, right? Did it fly over us?

47:54.577 --> 47:56.518
- No, they landed.
- What?

47:56.718 --> 47:59.585
Landed, what do you mean landed, man?

48:07.627 --> 48:09.561
Oh, my God.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.200
It's time to move.

48:19.140 --> 48:20.208
Where are we going?

48:20.308 --> 48:22.844
If you guys go that way,
you'll find a path back to your place.

48:22.944 --> 48:25.414
Wait, aren't you coming with us?

48:26.114 --> 48:28.950
Look, nobody invades my property
without expecting a fight.

48:29.050 --> 48:32.074
I'm American. It's my right to defend
what's mine, and nobody,

48:32.174 --> 48:35.357
not even little green men,
are gonna take that right away from me.

48:36.057 --> 48:39.159
Now you go, go on. Go on.

48:46.868 --> 48:48.918
Come and kiss my ass.

49:02.417 --> 49:04.384
What the hell?

49:08.022 --> 49:10.676
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

49:33.514 --> 49:35.081
Shit.

50:02.877 --> 50:06.293
So we want to play hide and seek, do we?

50:11.052 --> 50:14.534
Yeah. Yeah.

51:05.039 --> 51:06.945
Got you.

51:12.513 --> 51:14.814
Time to get your friends.

51:20.621 --> 51:24.493
- You have to help the others.
- What do you mean?

51:26.194 --> 51:30.965
They bring most people back.
Like they did with me.

51:31.265 --> 51:33.401
But not everyone.

51:33.701 --> 51:37.873
There's hundreds of people
still alive up there.

51:38.573 --> 51:41.643
Some of them
have been up there for years.

51:41.743 --> 51:44.646
Maybe even their whole lives.

51:46.147 --> 51:48.826
You've gotta do something.

52:19.781 --> 52:22.014
It can't be.

53:09.697 --> 53:11.966
I hope the boards hold.

53:12.066 --> 53:14.400
I think we're gonna be alright.

53:29.550 --> 53:31.380
What was that?

53:31.853 --> 53:34.320
Ok, whoa, whoa, whoa.

53:37.825 --> 53:39.512
- What do you see?
- I can't see anything.

53:39.612 --> 53:41.996
- What?
- I'm telling you, I can't see shit.

53:42.296 --> 53:44.329
Move, let me see.

53:53.595 --> 53:55.109
What? What? What is it?

53:55.209 --> 53:57.342
Oh, my God, it's right outside the door!

53:59.647 --> 54:01.387
It's going to get inside!

54:07.255 --> 54:09.455
Oh, my God, they're coming!

54:22.336 --> 54:26.340
Down! Get down!
Get on your knees! Get down!

54:26.440 --> 54:28.109
- Don't shoot!
- Put it down!

54:28.209 --> 54:29.877
Do it now! Back up!

54:29.977 --> 54:31.679
- Officer, we need your help!
- Back up!

54:31.779 --> 54:35.183
- Shut up, both of you!
- Hands against the wall! Now!

54:35.283 --> 54:39.597
You need to help us! We didn't do anything,
alright? This is fucking bullshit!

54:39.697 --> 54:44.525
This one's breath smells like whiskey,
sheriff, and he's belligerent!

54:45.226 --> 54:49.689
You, face me. We found your car
abandoned on the side of the road,

54:49.789 --> 54:51.801
do you mind telling me what the hell
is going on and why your friend

54:51.901 --> 54:53.901
- just tried to kill us?
- We were attacked.

54:54.001 --> 54:57.205
- We are not safe here!
- Quiet! He isn't talkin' to you!

54:57.305 --> 54:59.674
Cool it, Mitchell.

55:01.275 --> 55:04.445
You said you were attacked.
What happened?

55:04.945 --> 55:08.115
Look, I know that this is
gonna sound crazy, ok,

55:08.215 --> 55:12.989
but we saw something crash in the woods.
We thought it was a plane,

55:13.089 --> 55:16.224
but it was, like,
this disc shaped craft...

55:16.324 --> 55:18.226
It took our fucking friend.

55:18.326 --> 55:20.261
It was a UFO!

55:20.561 --> 55:23.145
I mean... it abducted our friend!

55:23.245 --> 55:26.283
- And it was a fucking UFO!
- She's telling you the truth, I swear!

55:26.383 --> 55:30.838
Listen to me for a second, listen to me.
There are fucking aliens everywhere, man!

55:30.938 --> 55:33.508
It was right outside the cabin,
we thought you were one of them!

55:33.608 --> 55:35.725
Why do you think I shot at you,
you dumb pig?

55:35.825 --> 55:37.311
Why do you think
we boarded up all the windows...

55:37.411 --> 55:39.413
Put your hands against the wall!

55:40.611 --> 55:43.284
Come on! Aliens? UFOs?

55:43.384 --> 55:47.722
Are you fucking listening to this shit,
sheriff? I mean, take a look around.

55:47.822 --> 55:51.058
There's booze and narcotics everywhere!

55:51.358 --> 55:54.469
You cannot possibly believe
this load of shit.

55:54.569 --> 55:58.570
Sheriff, I bet we search the basement,
we'll find us a full-on meth lab,

55:58.670 --> 56:02.203
- won't we, you little shit?
- We can prove it!

56:02.303 --> 56:03.771
One of them was in the house.

56:03.871 --> 56:07.306
I shot it. It's in the pool.

56:09.510 --> 56:12.628
Show me. Both of you.

56:12.728 --> 56:15.881
- You stay put. Go on.
- Ok.

56:17.018 --> 56:18.217
Get up, kid.

56:25.893 --> 56:30.363
Oh, my God. It was right here, I swear.

56:32.796 --> 56:34.728
It wasn't dead.

56:40.608 --> 56:43.311
You guys have another friend
hiding back there?

56:43.711 --> 56:47.548
No. It's just us. I swear.

56:47.648 --> 56:50.283
Get back in the house. Now.

57:02.630 --> 57:04.973
Sheriff's department.

57:06.734 --> 57:11.211
If someone's in there,
come out where I can see you.

59:20.468 --> 59:22.393
Oh, my God.

59:24.205 --> 59:31.476
So, when they took you
on board their... space ship,

59:32.546 --> 59:36.417
did they give you one of them...

59:37.199 --> 59:40.221
you know, anal probes?

59:40.521 --> 59:42.851
Oh, yeah, very original
you fucking idiot,

59:42.951 --> 59:46.193
I already told you it was my girlfriend
who got taken, not me!

59:46.293 --> 59:47.862
Hey!

59:48.162 --> 59:53.134
You know, you ain't got to go
into outer space to get probed.

59:53.234 --> 59:57.738
You'll be getting plenty of that
in the shower every day

59:57.838 --> 01:00:01.474
from a big guy named Mootombo.

01:00:07.047 --> 01:00:10.484
Sheriff, you have got to get a load
of this kid's story.

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:13.954
The boys back at the station,
they're gonna love this!

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:19.525
Sheriff? Hey, you with me?

01:00:22.896 --> 01:00:24.732
They're tellin' the truth.

01:00:26.967 --> 01:00:29.770
You see? I fucking told you!

01:00:30.971 --> 01:00:33.107
You can't be serious.

01:00:33.507 --> 01:00:36.989
I mean, come on man,
these kids are obviously high as kites,

01:00:37.089 --> 01:00:39.613
makin' this shit up! UFOs?

01:00:39.713 --> 01:00:43.648
Alien abductions?
I mean, this is horseshit!

01:00:50.591 --> 01:00:52.793
It's because of this, isn't it?

01:00:53.093 --> 01:00:56.308
It's been ten years, Alan.

01:00:56.597 --> 01:01:00.168
Now look. I mean no disrespect,

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:03.944
but it is time to face reality, man.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:05.684
She left you.

01:01:07.307 --> 01:01:11.358
People have been trying to
convince me that she just split town,

01:01:11.458 --> 01:01:15.377
just took off with another guy.
People have been saying it so long

01:01:15.477 --> 01:01:19.519
I almost believed it myself
but now I know what happened.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.267
What the hell are you talkin' about?

01:01:22.367 --> 01:01:27.561
She would have never done that to me.
We were in love with each other.

01:01:27.661 --> 01:01:33.298
That night I went to bed sleeping
next to her and I woke up...

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.736
and she was...

01:01:36.937 --> 01:01:39.140
she was gone.

01:01:40.941 --> 01:01:45.179
She didn't take any of her clothes,
didn't leave a note.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.716
How could she lock the front door
without taking her keys?

01:01:51.017 --> 01:01:53.077
I don't know,

01:01:53.179 --> 01:01:57.491
but I think you need to accept the fact
that she ain't never coming back.

01:01:57.691 --> 01:02:00.892
If it had been her choice,
Mitchell, then I would.

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:03.630
But I don't think she had one,
she was taken from me!

01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:07.135
Kidnapped, abducted, whatever you
want to call it, but goddammit,

01:02:07.235 --> 01:02:10.637
what happened to her is what's happening
to these kids right now!

01:02:10.737 --> 01:02:13.171
And we gotta get 'em outta here.

01:02:17.444 --> 01:02:21.449
Whoa, what the hell is that?
What the hell is that!?

01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:32.337
Oh, shit! Start the damn car!

01:03:15.936 --> 01:03:16.934
Don't do it!

01:03:21.175 --> 01:03:23.538
Fuck!

01:03:26.179 --> 01:03:30.281
Fuck! Shit! Shit!

01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:44.765
Are you ok?

01:03:44.865 --> 01:03:47.167
Get me out of this fucking car!

01:03:47.467 --> 01:03:50.871
Get these things off me, man!
Get 'em off, get 'em off!

01:03:51.171 --> 01:03:53.607
- What the fuck happened?
- Shit!

01:03:54.808 --> 01:03:58.515
They made him do it!
They got inside his fucking head,

01:03:58.615 --> 01:04:03.550
and they made him blow
his own fucking brains out! Oh, shit.

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:05.753
Shit, they're gonna take control
of all of us!

01:04:05.853 --> 01:04:08.322
- Just stay away from me!
- Seth. Calm down, ok?

01:04:08.422 --> 01:04:12.693
We can't stay here, ok? We can't stay here
'cause this shit, this shit

01:04:12.793 --> 01:04:16.995
is not gonna do anything, alright?
We are gonna die in here.

01:04:18.999 --> 01:04:20.801
- Give me that cop's gun.
- What?

01:04:20.901 --> 01:04:23.804
I said give me the fucking gun!

01:04:23.904 --> 01:04:27.123
- Shut the fuck up, Melanie.
- Put the fucking gun down.

01:04:27.223 --> 01:04:28.761
Oh, my God!

01:04:29.376 --> 01:04:32.106
I'm the one with the gun,
so you listen to me, ok?

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:34.365
Do you understand that, tough guy?

01:04:34.465 --> 01:04:37.582
- Seth!
- Back the fuck off!

01:04:39.586 --> 01:04:43.291
Ok, everyone, just calm down, alright?

01:04:43.791 --> 01:04:47.327
Ok, ok, just let me think.

01:04:47.427 --> 01:04:49.930
Just let me think, ok.

01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:53.834
Those fuckers are not gonna
get inside my head.

01:04:54.034 --> 01:04:58.940
Just give me a second, alright?
Just... everyone just fucking calm down.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.609
Let me think. These fuckers are not
gonna get inside my head, alright?

01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:05.522
So this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna make a break for town,

01:05:05.622 --> 01:05:09.216
you're coming with me, you get up,
you're coming with me.

01:05:09.316 --> 01:05:13.887
You stay put, because this is your fault.
They want you!

01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:16.323
So if they want you,
they can fucking have you!

01:05:16.423 --> 01:05:19.359
You're out of your fucking mind, Seth!
We're not leaving without her.

01:05:19.459 --> 01:05:21.995
Is that right? Is that right?

01:05:22.295 --> 01:05:24.631
Well, to hell with you.

01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:27.332
You can all stay here and rot.

01:05:31.104 --> 01:05:33.341
Have fun on your fucking honeymoon!

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:36.209
Oh, my God, are you ok?

01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:37.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:05:37.645 --> 01:05:40.278
I can see why you
didn't want him to come.

01:05:55.729 --> 01:05:57.695
You guys?

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:15.346
What the fuck was that?

01:06:29.030 --> 01:06:32.096
- Get away from the window!
- Oh, God.

01:06:47.281 --> 01:06:48.916
Oh, my God.

01:07:45.405 --> 01:07:47.668
We gotta get to the basement!

01:07:49.376 --> 01:07:52.675
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go!

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:57.716
Kyle, let's go!

01:08:02.455 --> 01:08:05.559
- Kyle, what're you doing?
- I'm not letting them get you, babe.

01:08:05.659 --> 01:08:07.895
No, Kyle! Open the fucking door!

01:08:07.995 --> 01:08:12.632
- No, I'm gonna be ok!
- No, Kyle, please don't do this!

01:08:12.732 --> 01:08:15.669
Babe, there's no other choice.
I have to, I'm sorry.

01:08:15.869 --> 01:08:18.238
You are gonna get out of here,
and you're gonna survive.

01:08:18.337 --> 01:08:21.875
No! What about you?

01:08:22.175 --> 01:08:23.941
I'm full of surprises!

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.890
Kyle?

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:34.020
Kyle, No! Kyle! Kyle!

01:08:40.694 --> 01:08:42.062
Ok.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.716
Hey! I'm up here, you motherfucker!

01:09:03.817 --> 01:09:05.920
Up here! Come on!

01:09:31.711 --> 01:09:34.147
Shit! Shit!

01:09:35.247 --> 01:09:37.517
Fuck. Shit.

01:09:37.617 --> 01:09:42.520
No, no, no. Fuck. Fuck! Shit!

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.143
Ok, alright. Fuck.

01:10:00.107 --> 01:10:02.106
Who's there?

01:10:06.413 --> 01:10:08.580
Who's out there!?

01:10:12.886 --> 01:10:15.756
Fuck, who's out there?! Huh?

01:10:18.592 --> 01:10:20.907
Fuck you!

01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:24.598
You motherfucker!

01:10:26.099 --> 01:10:27.678
You're not taking me!

01:10:29.703 --> 01:10:33.071
You fuck! Shit! Shit!

01:11:15.815 --> 01:11:18.683
Fuck! Fuck!

01:11:23.857 --> 01:11:26.569
No! No!

01:11:31.097 --> 01:11:34.233
No, no, please, you can't take me!
You can't...

01:12:04.397 --> 01:12:08.935
You remember when we came out here
that summer before high school started?

01:12:09.035 --> 01:12:12.672
Yeah, it was right before
my parents broke up.

01:12:12.772 --> 01:12:17.476
We raided your parents' liquor cabinet
and got so drunk.

01:12:20.981 --> 01:12:24.415
And your dad took us
fishing the next day...

01:12:25.616 --> 01:12:27.836
And you threw up all over the boat.

01:12:30.156 --> 01:12:36.396
And you covered for me,
you said that I was just sea sick.

01:12:36.496 --> 01:12:39.197
We were only on the lake.

01:12:43.303 --> 01:12:47.332
That was the best summer ever.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:00.352
I think I took too many.

01:13:01.053 --> 01:13:04.892
No, Mel. No, Mel, why did you do that?

01:13:05.192 --> 01:13:09.850
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:15.959
I don't want to go up there.
I don't want them to take me.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:20.060
No. No, it's ok.

01:13:24.377 --> 01:13:26.947
I'm really tired.

01:13:27.447 --> 01:13:31.018
I think I'm gonna close my eyes
for a little while.

01:13:31.318 --> 01:13:33.486
No. No.

01:13:33.586 --> 01:13:37.023
No, Mel, no, no! Please, no!

01:13:37.123 --> 01:13:39.426
Mel! Wake up!

01:13:39.526 --> 01:13:43.663
Mel, wake up! Don't do this to me!

01:17:42.101 --> 01:17:43.829
Kyle?

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.776
No. No!

01:17:49.876 --> 01:17:51.644
No!

01:17:51.944 --> 01:17:54.083
No, wait!

01:17:54.183 --> 01:17:56.833
No! Don't go!

01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:16.905
Come back, please!

01:18:17.371 --> 01:18:19.304
Come back!

01:18:20.707 --> 01:18:24.344
Come back! Come back!

01:18:25.044 --> 01:18:27.514
No, please! Come back!

01:18:27.814 --> 01:18:29.609
Come get me!

01:18:30.516 --> 01:18:32.621
Come get me!

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.577
I'm right here, please!

01:18:39.359 --> 01:18:41.726
No, please.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:09.690
I'm sorry, Kyle.

01:19:13.593 --> 01:19:16.435
I'm sorry, Kyle.

01:23:33.186 --> 01:23:35.517
Oh, oh, shit!

01:23:41.027 --> 01:23:44.342
Help! Somebody, help!

01:24:12.158 --> 01:24:14.042
Fuck!

01:26:32.532 --> 01:26:34.543
Oh, my God.

01:26:49.548 --> 01:26:50.850
Kyle!

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:54.309
Oh, my God, Kyle!

01:26:55.487 --> 01:26:58.055
I'm gonna get you out of here!

01:26:59.258 --> 01:27:00.725
It's ok.

01:27:02.726 --> 01:27:04.461
It's ok.

01:27:05.064 --> 01:27:08.067
No. No!

01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:10.774
No. Kyle!

01:27:25.184 --> 01:27:28.021
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:27:31.223 --> 01:27:33.317
Oh, God.

01:27:34.326 --> 01:27:39.617
When you proposed, I should have
said yes, I was just scared.

01:27:40.466 --> 01:27:43.702
Well, I'm not scared anymore.

01:27:43.802 --> 01:27:48.739
Because what I said about us being alone,
I know that's not true.

01:27:54.246 --> 01:27:57.549
So wake up. Wake up!

01:27:57.950 --> 01:28:02.587
You're not dying!
No, you're not dying! Wake up, Kyle!

01:28:05.324 --> 01:28:09.494
No, wake up, Kyle! Kyle, wake up!

01:28:09.795 --> 01:28:11.863
Wake up!

01:28:12.764 --> 01:28:16.836
Kyle! Kyle, wake up! Wake up!

01:28:23.275 --> 01:28:28.347
Oh, my God, it's ok!
Just breathe! Just breathe!

01:28:28.647 --> 01:28:32.135
April! What're you doing here?

01:28:32.851 --> 01:28:35.922
It's "April and Kyle", remember?

01:28:36.222 --> 01:28:38.406
Where you go, I go.

01:28:40.092 --> 01:28:42.761
I didn't mean outer space.

01:30:08.314 --> 01:30:10.273
What happened?

01:30:13.619 --> 01:30:15.955
I don't know.

01:30:17.456 --> 01:30:19.010
You came back for me.

01:30:22.027 --> 01:30:24.665
You're fucking crazy, April.

01:30:32.137 --> 01:30:34.764
You just realized that now?

01:30:55.727 --> 01:31:00.593
<i>The book of love is long and boring</i>

01:31:00.693 --> 01:31:05.204
<i>No one can lift the damn thing</i>

01:31:05.504 --> 01:31:10.375
<i>It's full of charts
and facts and figures</i>

01:31:10.475 --> 01:31:14.413
<i>And instructions for dancing</i>

01:31:14.513 --> 01:31:17.205
<i>But I,</i>

01:31:20.318 --> 01:31:24.690
<i>I love it when you read to me</i>

01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:27.247
<i>You</i>

01:31:30.362 --> 01:31:34.831
<i>You can read me anything</i>

01:31:39.838 --> 01:31:44.543
<i>The book of love has music in it</i>

01:31:44.643 --> 01:31:47.413
<i>In fact that's where...</i>

01:31:47.713 --> 01:31:49.715
Wait, wait, wait.

01:31:50.516 --> 01:31:52.653
Do you hear that?

01:31:55.354 --> 01:31:57.223
What is that?

01:31:58.624 --> 01:31:59.923
It's over there!

01:32:03.929 --> 01:32:06.665
<i>I love it when you sing to me</i>

01:32:06.765 --> 01:32:09.199
Hey! Over here!

01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:14.505
Help us!

01:32:39.131 --> 01:32:42.151
No! No, wait! Wait, wait, wait!

01:34:36.782 --> 01:34:38.984
That's the last of them.

01:34:39.084 --> 01:34:42.621
Good. Do we know anything yet?

01:34:42.721 --> 01:34:46.992
Intel is still coming in, but it looks like
the storm caused the crash.

01:34:47.092 --> 01:34:49.327
Like the one last year in Portugal.

01:34:49.427 --> 01:34:53.264
- Fatalities?
- Fairly minimal.

01:34:53.765 --> 01:34:56.468
Stories are already being prepared.

01:34:56.568 --> 01:34:59.205
What should we do with the bodies?

01:35:12.618 --> 01:35:15.165
Same thing we always do.

01:35:38.143 --> 01:35:41.780
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:45.683
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:49.487
<i>When I lay me down to die</i>

01:35:49.587 --> 01:35:53.325
<i>Goin' up to the spirit in the sky</i>

01:35:53.425 --> 01:35:56.995
<i>Goin' up to the spirit in the sky</i>

01:35:57.095 --> 01:36:01.066
<i>That's where I'm gonna go when I die</i>

01:36:01.166 --> 01:36:04.002
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

01:36:04.102 --> 01:36:08.504
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

01:36:24.255 --> 01:36:27.592
<i>Prepare yourself, you know it's a must</i>

01:36:27.692 --> 01:36:31.763
<i>Gotta have a friend in Jesus</i>

01:36:31.863 --> 01:36:35.166
<i>So you know that when you die</i>

01:36:35.266 --> 01:36:39.104
<i>He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky</i>

01:36:39.204 --> 01:36:43.441
<i>Gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky</i>

01:36:43.541 --> 01:36:47.245
<i>That's where you're gonna go
when you die</i>

01:36:47.345 --> 01:36:50.215
<i>When you die and they lay you to rest</i>

01:36:50.315 --> 01:36:54.650
<i>You're gonna go to the place
that's the best</i>

01:37:40.890 --> 01:37:44.692
<i>Never been a sinner, I've never sinned</i>

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:48.963
<i>I got a friend in Jesus</i>

01:37:49.063 --> 01:37:52.266
<i>So you know that when I die</i>

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:56.204
<i>He's gonna me send me up
with the spirit in the sky</i>

01:37:56.304 --> 01:38:00.441
<i>Oh, send me up
with the spirit in the sky</i>

01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:04.245
<i>That's where I'm gonna go when I die</i>

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:07.215
<i>When I die and they lay me to rest</i>

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:11.350
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

01:38:11.451 --> 01:38:15.551
<i>Gonna go to the place that's the best</i>

01:38:16.305 --> 01:38:22.638
