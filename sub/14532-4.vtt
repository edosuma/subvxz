00:04.254 --> 00:05.846
Previously on "Power"...

00:06.006 --> 00:08.100
I'll be all right
when I get back on my feet.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.259
Pass me them pills.

00:09.343 --> 00:13.018
So you told Jukebox to move to D.C.
and accept who she really is.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.308
It's probably why
she looks up to you so much.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.485
You killed two people
right in front of me.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.648
- I think I should walk away.
- We're talking about one job here.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.781
Well, whatever you got going,
I want in on it.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.488
The drugs
we gave you been stepped on.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.198
I need you to right this wrong.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.866
I had a meeting
with Karen Bassett.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.912
She's interested in putting one of
my clubs in a new space she's opening.

00:34.952 --> 00:38.081
I know you can run a club,
but who is James St. Patrick?

00:38.247 --> 00:40.545
The only other person
who can confirm that St. Patrick

00:40.707 --> 00:42.505
is the distributor is Vibora Ruiz.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.645
I was hoping maybe you could
use some of your DEA contacts,

00:44.670 --> 00:45.910
- help me find him.
- All right.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.048
They're saying Tariq
brought a gun to school.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.094
The gun is registered
to an Angela Valdes.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.340
My kids won't be staying
at that bitch's house again.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.510
I'm glad you two are
getting along so well together.

00:55.535 --> 00:57.391
We're getting shit set up.

00:57.558 --> 01:00.152
I want to know
what you are doing about Ghost.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.439
Lobos killed our dog, Tommy.
Next time it's gonna be you or me.

I'm gonna be volunteering
at the school a couple days a week,

03:07.354 --> 03:09.402
and Tariq starts therapy tomorrow.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.924
Yeah, I wonder what kind of
questions they're gonna ask him.

03:11.949 --> 03:13.819
I don't know, but I'll make sure

03:13.985 --> 03:16.704
that he knows
which ones not to answer.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.833
The therapist's office
is across town.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.111
I can take him, but I'm gonna
need you to pick him up.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.412
Can't tomorrow.

03:23.578 --> 03:26.001
Got a big meeting about the club
that I can't reschedule.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.168
Tariq needs to know
that he's a priority in your life.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.553
Providing for you
and the kids is a priority,

03:31.712 --> 03:33.192
which is why I can't
miss the meeting.

03:33.354 --> 03:35.114
The kids appreciate
all that you do for them,

03:35.273 --> 03:38.219
but you need to show your face
around here every once in a while.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.729
And if they can't come here,
how am I supposed to see them?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.764
You can see them
any time you want

03:42.931 --> 03:44.729
as long as it ain't at Angela's.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.191

04:02.659 --> 04:04.536
This is all my fault.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.089
The last thing I'd ever want to do

04:08.248 --> 04:10.967
- is keep you away from your kids.
- What's done is done, Ang.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.046
Just got to figure out a way
to make it all work.

04:13.071 --> 04:15.923
Are you comfortable with the kids
coming back here?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.968
Yeah, of course I am.
You made a mistake, Ang.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.557
I mean, it won't happen again.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.064
No, it won't.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.904
Paz is coming over
for dinner tonight.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.610
You want me to cancel?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.214
It just seems like bad timing
with everything that's going on.

04:36.239 --> 04:38.115
No, no, no, don't cancel.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.497

06:23.300 --> 06:25.394
Hey, how did things go with Tariq
the other night?

06:25.552 --> 06:28.101
He didn't show.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.315
Ghost did.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.726
- Another Ghost trick.
- You didn't do it?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.613
I thought I was gonna be
hooping with Tariq.

06:34.638 --> 06:37.016
I didn't have
my fucking piece on me.

06:40.609 --> 06:43.783

- What would that be?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.907
Maybe you could...

06:47.866 --> 06:49.914
hire somebody.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.828
I don't know.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.087
Just might make things
a little easier, you know?

06:56.249 --> 06:59.219
Last time we outsourced
to the Jamaicans,

06:59.377 --> 07:01.630
shit didn't go over well.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.889
Besides, Lobos told me to do it.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.057
Then I guess you better do it.

07:12.223 --> 07:15.067

it's to thwart a specific threat.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.601
Is there a person
we should anticipate?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.058
If it's predictable,
it's preventable.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.315
Club business...

12:45.473 --> 12:47.396
is simply competitive.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.318
When you have something
that everybody wants,

12:49.477 --> 12:51.400
it's easy to create enemies.

12:51.562 --> 12:54.406
The cost of having it all, right?

12:54.565 --> 12:55.612
No doubt.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.075
Well, how do you want to proceed with
your personal detail, Mr. St. Patrick?

12:59.237 --> 13:01.660
I'd like you guys to stay on me
a while longer.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.169
- Just to be safe.
- Right.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.829
Just to be safe.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.109
- Is he in jail?
- No.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.318
- Is he dead?
- No, Tasha, Jamie is fine.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.034
I got Tariq's record expunged.

13:43.698 --> 13:46.451
The school reported
the incident to the NYPD.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.291
I know Tariq is a good kid,
so I called in a favor.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.172
It'll be like it never happened.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.292
Tasha, I'm sorry.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.302
This is my fault.

13:56.461 --> 14:00.056
- It was the least I could do.
- Yeah... the least.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.555
But you know
you didn't do it for Tariq.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.971
Sure as hell didn't do it for me.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.981
You did this for Ghost.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.815
And as long as you stay
in this thing with him,

14:12.977 --> 14:15.776
you're gonna be doing for Ghost
the rest of your life.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.862
Good-bye.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.038
That's a nice shave.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.673
It's as smooth as my ball sack.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.084
We run out too fast.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.173
Yeah, next shipment's arrived.
It's full weight.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.010
What about the extra keys
you promised me?

14:41.172 --> 14:42.344
I'm a man of my word.

14:42.507 --> 14:45.727
You'll get them as long as we don't run
into no more problems like last time.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.808
The problem
has been taken care of.

14:51.516 --> 14:53.234
I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.145
It won't happen again.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.942
Good.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.125
You did me a solid, man.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.092
Those aliases you gave me
on Vibora Ruiz paid off.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.219
He's in San Diego.
I'm flying out tonight.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.927
Nice.
You need DEA backup on this thing?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.569
Should I call my guys, have them
meet you on-site, lend a hand?

15:25.594 --> 15:26.642
No, thanks.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.769
Already coordinated
with San Diego PD, so...

15:28.928 --> 15:30.350
Cool.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.558
Well, shit, Knox,
I smell a promotion.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.772
And unlike Angela,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.695
you've done it without
sucking anyone's dick.

15:41.566 --> 15:44.661
She didn't suck Mike's dick
to get on the task force.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.248
DOJ drafted a deal.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.671
If Ruiz takes it,

15:55.830 --> 15:57.924
finally have a witness
to testify against Lobos.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.918
- But Lobos is dead.
- Right.

16:01.085 --> 16:04.009
I meant testify against Tommy Egan
and James St. Patrick.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.512
Ruiz, he can name
the whole network.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.267
It's really too bad Lobos got got,

16:08.426 --> 16:10.586
'cause Ruiz would've been
a direct witness against him.

16:10.720 --> 16:11.721
When I was working UC,

16:11.846 --> 16:14.474
I saw him talking to Lobos
with my own fucking eyes.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.859
- He would've cracked the case wide open.
- Yeah.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.859
Oh, shit, I got to go.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.866
You let me know
how it all plays out.

16:24.025 --> 16:26.027
You call me if you need anything,

16:26.194 --> 16:28.037
and you get it all by the book.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.716
I don't want to see any of these
motherfuckers walking on techs.

16:30.741 --> 16:32.789
Come on. You know it.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.232
- Thanks a lot.
- Good luck, bro.

16:36.257 --> 16:37.634
All right.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.635
Sorry I'm late.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.801
Smells delicious.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.810
What are you making?

16:52.970 --> 16:55.439
You went to see Tasha?

16:57.475 --> 16:58.943
What the hell were you thinking?

17:00.269 --> 17:02.192
After hearing your conversation
this morning

17:02.355 --> 17:03.875
and knowing how much
you miss the kids,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.575
it seemed like
the right thing to do.

17:07.984 --> 17:09.828
I had good intentions.

17:09.987 --> 17:12.240
I appreciate you
taking care of Tariq's record,

17:12.406 --> 17:14.909
but you should ask me
before you go over there.

17:16.827 --> 17:19.751
I don't need to ask
for your permission, Jamie.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.588
Oh, yes, you do.
Especially when it comes to my wife.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.219
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't think I do.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.264
You gonna get the door?

17:44.855 --> 17:47.529
Paz! Entrar.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.696
- Angelita, it's <i>so</i> good to see you.
- You too.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.034
- How are you?
- Good.

17:53.948 --> 17:55.040
You look pretty.

17:56.534 --> 17:58.957
You remember Jamie.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.419
- Qué pasa, Paz?
- Good.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.131
Can I get you some wine?

18:05.293 --> 18:07.216
Okay.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.882
So it's been a long time.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.392
Quite a long time.

18:13.551 --> 18:17.021
- Para ti.
- Gracias.

18:19.056 --> 18:23.061
Jamie, how nice of you
to pay the rent.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.979
Angela's always paid
for her own things.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.240
Never depended on a man before.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.241
Jamie, why would you do that?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.368
I had good intentions.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.706
So what's the problem?

18:36.907 --> 18:39.581
Isn't dinner ready? Let's eat.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.917
So what does that mean?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.582
It means you won't have a record.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.592
It means Angela
made the whole thing go away.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.925
- Dad made her do that for me?
- Something like that.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.341
Look, 'Riq, our family's
not like other families.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.760
Not like other families at school.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.645
Ma, I know.
You tell me this all the time.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.398
We have to do better and be better
than the kids at school.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.029
- I'm sorry.
- I know you are.

19:11.025 --> 19:13.619
There are certain things about us

19:13.778 --> 19:15.951
that your father and I don't want
anyone to know.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.911
Okay?

19:18.532 --> 19:21.126
When you go in there tomorrow
to talk to the therapist,

19:21.285 --> 19:23.959
I just want you to answer
his questions.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.624
Don't say more than you have to.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.545
So you want me to lie?

19:32.546 --> 19:34.219
No, baby.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.885
You're a smart kid.
You'll know what to do.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.154
I am glad we were finally
able to do this.

19:52.316 --> 19:54.068
I didn't think it was gonna happen.

19:54.235 --> 19:57.159
Well, that was my fault,
and I'm sorry.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.495
Angela, I remember
back in the day

20:00.658 --> 20:03.411
when you got grounded
for sneaking out to meet Jamie.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.830
- Papi was pissed!
- You remember that?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.373
He was chasing me down the street.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.168
Told me to never come back,
but I couldn't stay away.

20:10.334 --> 20:13.213
Are you in contact with anyone
from the old neighborhood?

20:13.379 --> 20:16.929
What ever happened to
that mamao, Tommy Egan?

20:17.091 --> 20:19.514
He and I lost touch.
But enough about the past.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.184
How's your son? How's he doing?

20:22.346 --> 20:25.691
Junior's great.
Finishing school, looking for a job.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.694
- Congratulations. That's super cool.
- What about your kids?

20:28.853 --> 20:31.356
How'd they take the news
about your divorce?

20:39.029 --> 20:41.908
- You're not divorced yet.
- He's working on it.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.496
Sure.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.299
I'll be right back.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.462
- You okay, Ang?
- I'm fine.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.307
So, Paz, of course, you know,
job market is tough right now,

20:58.466 --> 21:00.935
but I have,

21:01.093 --> 21:03.642
an opening at a club
if Junior was interested.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.226
Thanks, I appreciate it,

21:05.389 --> 21:09.895
but I wouldn't want to put my son
in an awkward situation.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.108
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, just in case

21:12.271 --> 21:14.031
things don't work out
between you and Angela.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.450
Showtime, motherfuckers.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.038
- Which one would you like to see?
- That one, please.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.807
Everybody shut the fuck up
and get on the floor now!

21:47.973 --> 21:50.101
You! Move it!

21:51.435 --> 21:54.279
Get the fuck down!
Bitch, don't make me shoot you!

21:55.022 --> 21:57.320
Come on, move!

21:57.483 --> 21:58.735
Let's

22:02.279 --> 22:04.122
I told you to stay down!

22:05.616 --> 22:07.118
Shut the fuck up!

22:07.284 --> 22:10.163
Everybody shut the fuck up!

22:10.329 --> 22:12.957
- Open the shit.
- Would you calm the fuck down, man?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.592
Everybody shut up!

22:24.593 --> 22:26.061
If you move,
I'll fucking kill you!

22:26.220 --> 22:28.723
Shut the fuck up!

22:28.889 --> 22:31.233
- The fuck?
- Peace, nigga.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.821
Hurry UP!

22:35.980 --> 22:37.948
Yo, hurry "P!

22:39.233 --> 22:40.735
Let's go.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.323
Let's

22:48.659 --> 22:51.538
- The fuck happened?
- Go, motherfucker.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.422
Drive!

22:55.165 --> 22:57.714
All available units
respond to Tivoli Jewelry

22:57.877 --> 22:59.925
at 372 Jefferson Avenue.

23:00.087 --> 23:03.341
Take-over robbery just occurred.
Suspects are armed and dangerous.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.885
Suspect vehicle is
a black Suburban, no plates.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.553
Car 41805.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.940
I've got a black Explorer
leaving at a high rate of speed.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.520
No plates.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.529
Occupied by four white males
headed northeast on Jefferson Ave.

23:21.442 --> 23:23.695
- Angela.
- The California case files

23:23.861 --> 23:27.240
finally came through,
and I think I have a break in the case.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.958
What do you got?

23:30.117 --> 23:33.371
I found the wife of one of the victims
from your safe-house murders.

23:33.537 --> 23:37.212
Her husband was making
50 grand on a U.S. Marshal salary,

23:37.374 --> 23:40.469
but now his widow is living
the high life in a mansion in La Jolla.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.505
That doesn't track.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.222
It's possible the marshal
had a good life insurance policy

23:48.385 --> 23:50.058
given his high-risk profession.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.340
Or maybe someone's
taking care of her with hush money.

23:52.365 --> 23:53.815
She might know something.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.817
I've left her a message
to set a call.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.536
Let me know when
you hear back from her.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.425
Since your DJ Taj fuck-up,

24:20.584 --> 24:22.803
I notice you been hustling
extra hard in the clubs.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.589
Attending this meeting is
your reward.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.132
Just sit back, listen, learn.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.767
That street shit is
second nature to you, Andre.

24:28.926 --> 24:30.606
We got to get it
where this hustle is, too.

24:30.631 --> 24:32.680
Especially if you still
considering doing both.

24:32.846 --> 24:35.941
Look, man, I know I wasn't getting it
all at first, but, on the real,

24:36.100 --> 24:38.285
shit's been hard having one foot
in the hood and one foot out.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.030
Nothing tougher than
shedding that old skin,

24:40.145 --> 24:43.149
having to leave behind those
that ain't willing to grow with you.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.943
- There she is.
- James.

24:46.110 --> 24:48.112
Andre, meet the lovely
Karen Bassett.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.451
- Karen, this is Andre.
- Nice to meet you.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.788
Damn, you look banging
in that dress.

24:53.951 --> 24:56.545
- Thank you.
- There we are.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.796
Right on time.

24:57.955 --> 25:01.004
One Superiority Burger for
the boss lady flown in from East Village.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.964
- I got it right, right?
- Nice work.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.603
Important to know the taste
of the tastemakers.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.909
Speaking of which, you know
how excited I am to talk about

25:07.067 --> 25:09.320
the potential expansion of
my brand into your new hotel.

25:09.486 --> 25:11.802
I am, too,
but there's one problem.

25:11.969 --> 25:15.143
I did more research on you,
and nobody knows who you are.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.057
Isn't that interesting,
seeing as though

25:17.224 --> 25:19.727
my name and my clubs are
mentioned in several publications.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.146
That's not enough.
You need to develop and manage

25:22.312 --> 25:24.690
your brand on social media
just like everyone else.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.905
I'll show you.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.738
See all these owners?

25:30.904 --> 25:32.497
Partying with their clientele.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.079
Free bottle service
isn't enough anymore.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.869
Regular people
want to feel like celebs,

25:37.036 --> 25:38.834
like they have access.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.589
Give them access.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.548
Let them feel like they know you
and they'll keep coming back for more.

25:43.573 --> 25:45.586
No doubt. Demand and supply.

25:45.753 --> 25:47.050
Don't you mean
supply and demand?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.052
No, they've been teaching
that wrong for years.

25:49.173 --> 25:52.598
You see, demand comes first,
and whoever supplies it profits.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.433
Right.

25:54.595 --> 25:58.350
Karen, my brand is the mystery
of James St. Patrick.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.915
People are intrigued
by the unknown.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.217
Look, I want to take our relationship
to the next level,

26:02.242 --> 26:04.776
but I can't set a meeting
with my board of directors

26:04.938 --> 26:07.111
until you get on social media.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.448
Your brand needs a face.
I can't sell a ghost.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.847
Vibora Ruiz.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.568
Agent Greg Knox, FBI.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.939
Well, this is not
what I expected from a guy

26:47.106 --> 26:50.076
that spent three decades
building the Soldado Nation.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.363
Guess you just had no place else to go
when Lobos forced you out?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.119
God, I bet you were pissed.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.124
Fuck, I know I would be

26:58.283 --> 27:01.002
if someone took away
everything I had worked for.

27:06.500 --> 27:08.468
You're not safe here.
Lobos knows where you are.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.755
We've been monitoring
his communications

27:10.921 --> 27:14.095
and we just got credible intel
that says he's got hitters

27:14.258 --> 27:16.852
crossing the border right now
to kill you and your family.

27:17.010 --> 27:20.105
You got two options...
You stay here and you die,

27:20.264 --> 27:24.064
or you take a deal
and you testify against Lobos.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.416
And with him out of the way,
you could take your business back.

27:30.274 --> 27:31.446
That's right.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.612
Go back to work
with the FBI's blessing.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.621
Back to your life.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.126
I heard your father was sick.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.044
You didn't know.

27:49.376 --> 27:51.754
You can't always believe
what a cop says.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.800
But Lobos' men are coming.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.809
You want to call my bluff, fine,

27:57.968 --> 28:00.312
but you're gonna be
betting with your life,

28:00.470 --> 28:02.689
with your family's lives.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.535
- What's up, T?
- What's up?

28:14.693 --> 28:18.118
- Hey, you got any leftovers?
- Go and check for your damn self.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.580
Holly, when you gonna learn
how to cook?

28:22.743 --> 28:24.666
Tasha, maybe you could teach her.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.708
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

28:26.733 --> 28:29.667
- I got other skills.
- I know that's right.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.256
Looks like you gonna be
coming over here to eat, Tommy.

28:32.419 --> 28:34.421
- Uncle T.
- Yo, what's up, 'Riq?

28:34.588 --> 28:36.010
- What's up?
- How you feeling, man?

28:36.173 --> 28:38.392
- Good.
- Shouldn't you be at school?

28:38.550 --> 28:41.850
Boy got suspended.
You need to talk some sense into him.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.856
What's wrong with you?
Come on, son. Talk to me.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.017
Me and you gonna
have a little talk, all right?

28:48.518 --> 28:51.613
Last time I got suspended...

29:09.206 --> 29:12.050
Since when does wine
get wasted with you?

29:12.209 --> 29:14.587
L...

29:17.547 --> 29:19.641
You're not drinking.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.637
You're about to cry for no reason.
Shit, Holly.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.848
Please don't tell me you're...

29:29.226 --> 29:30.978
Tommy!

29:31.144 --> 29:34.739
I'm gonna go take Holly to check out
a new lipstick I got, okay?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.696
Yeah, we good.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.287
Where did you get a gun anyway?

29:40.445 --> 29:42.493
Well, I took it out of Angela's purse.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.083
Got to talk to some idiot therapist.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.962
My mom doesn't want me
to tell him anything.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.122
Your moms is right.
She's just looking out for you.

29:49.289 --> 29:50.914
You know that, right? Right?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.300
Yeah, I just... l just wish
they could be real with me.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.086
They're always fake.
Like, Dad, he moved with Angela,

29:56.253 --> 29:58.293
and I still don't know
what happened to Uncle Shawn.

29:58.422 --> 30:02.302
It's like he could do whatever
he wants and get away with it.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.764
Yeah, no doubt.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.929
Listen, you got every right
to be upset.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.349
Families are supposed
to stay together, not break up.

30:08.515 --> 30:11.815
But if I do know one thing
about your old man, Tariq,

30:11.977 --> 30:14.400
he loves the crap out of you.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.783
And no matter what happens...

30:20.444 --> 30:23.823
your Uncle Tommy
always got your back.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.334
Forever.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.458
- The fuck you gonna do with a baby?
- I don't know.

30:30.620 --> 30:34.170
You ain't been in the game but a minute.
You gonna be a dealer's baby mama?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.802
You got no clue
what you're getting yourself into.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.134
Every time Tommy
walks out that door,

30:40.297 --> 30:42.174
he may never come back.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.059
You think you can raise a kid
on your own?

30:46.303 --> 30:47.555
You're doing it.

30:47.721 --> 30:50.315
Ghost ain't dead,
and my mama helps me.

30:50.474 --> 30:54.149
Now, Kate Egan,
she ain't exactly grandma material.

30:54.311 --> 30:56.405
Have you met her crazy ass?

30:56.563 --> 30:57.655
No.

31:04.154 --> 31:06.498
Does Tommy want to keep the baby?

31:15.374 --> 31:17.297
Tommy doesn't know?

31:20.796 --> 31:23.094
I really want to tell him.
I just...

31:23.256 --> 31:25.679
I haven't decided if I'm keeping it yet.

31:25.842 --> 31:28.721
I really love Tommy
and I want to be a family.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.480
L just...

31:31.765 --> 31:34.860
- I don't know.
- You can't not fucking tell him.

31:35.644 --> 31:37.362
The baby is half his too.

31:37.521 --> 31:40.445
If he found out you did something
without talking to him first,

31:40.607 --> 31:43.201
well, I wouldn't want to be you
when he finds out.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.543
I'm James St. Patrick,
the owner of Verbatim.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.781
I want to thank y'all
for spending the night with me!

31:53.870 --> 31:57.215
Next 30 minutes, open bar!

32:06.425 --> 32:09.178
Shit's so fucking good.
Why ain't you eating, babe?

32:10.470 --> 32:13.064
- I'm not hungry.
- Have a bite.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.317
I said I'm not hungry. Jesus.

32:15.475 --> 32:17.398
About to be on the rag
or something?

32:17.561 --> 32:20.815
Did you ever reach out to
the Jamaicans on the Ghost thing?

32:20.981 --> 32:22.904
No, I've been busy doing drops.

32:23.066 --> 32:26.115
I'm not gonna go all the way up
to Queens to that fucking restaurant

32:26.278 --> 32:28.278
to ask them to do something
that I could do myself.

32:28.303 --> 32:29.956
You got to be fucking kidding me.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.958
Are you ever gonna do it?!

32:32.117 --> 32:33.585
Yo, I don't get you.

32:33.743 --> 32:36.263
A minute ago you was busting
my balls about me not trusting you,

32:36.422 --> 32:39.142
but now I'm getting the sense
that you're the one who don't trust me.

32:39.167 --> 32:41.414
You don't believe in me, Holly?

32:44.463 --> 32:46.682
Fuck.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.311
Of course I believe in you.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.814
- It's just...
- Just what?

32:53.972 --> 32:55.772
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

32:55.797 --> 32:58.050
Nah, fuck that.
I'm done talking.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.043
- Welcome back.
- Good to be back, sir.

34:43.998 --> 34:47.549
Agent Greg Knox
has caught us a very big fish,

34:47.710 --> 34:50.931
and it is with great pleasure
that I welcome him back on the team.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.137
Go ahead
and give everyone the update.

34:53.300 --> 34:55.553
Okay, thank you.

34:55.719 --> 34:59.144
Well, I know we've all been
working tirelessly for months

34:59.306 --> 35:01.058
to prosecute Felipe Lobos,

35:01.224 --> 35:04.398
and now we finally have the star witness
we need to lock him away for good.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.905
I found Vibora Ruiz in San Diego.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.423
Took some convincing
and we're gonna have to cut him a deal,

35:09.482 --> 35:12.577
but he's agreed to testify
against Lobos.

35:14.404 --> 35:17.578
And I think we can convince him
to give us the whole network.

35:18.241 --> 35:21.745
This is a huge win for us, folks.
Congratulations, Greg.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.584
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Good job.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.253
You know what?

35:29.419 --> 35:33.014
You got some ratchet-ass
customers up in the shop.

35:33.173 --> 35:35.426
Who was the girl
getting a blonde weave?

35:35.592 --> 35:38.272
Girl, you don't even know, right?
So her man's been cheating on her.

35:38.438 --> 35:41.078
Said the other night he came home late
and she straight up told him

35:41.149 --> 35:43.771
to pull his pants down
<i>so</i> she could smell his dick.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.025
- Oh, no, she didn't.
- Yes.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.984
And she took one whiff
and kicked his ass to the curb.

35:48.146 --> 35:49.648
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.693
I told you that girl was crazy.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.702
So what you doing?
You redecorating, T?

35:54.861 --> 35:57.785
I thought it would be fun trying to
make this place the way I wanted,

35:57.947 --> 36:00.228
but honestly, I don't even know
how to pick something out.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.706
What do you mean?
What do you like, T?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.963
That's the problem.
I don't know what I like.

36:06.122 --> 36:10.127
Everything in this place,
Ghost picked out.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.723
I mean, he always made
those decisions for us.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.844
For me.
I dress the way he liked.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.104
I wear my hair the way
he wanted me to.

36:22.972 --> 36:25.225
I don't really remember
who I was before him.

36:26.309 --> 36:29.313
When you first started dating Ghost,
he did change you,

36:29.479 --> 36:31.152
and now I'm starting
to get you back.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.658
You know what I see
when I look at you?

36:33.817 --> 36:36.661
I see a bad bitch who is about
to be balling on her own,

36:36.820 --> 36:38.663
and whenever you're ready,

36:38.822 --> 36:41.325
any man would be lucky
to have you and spoil you rotten.

36:41.491 --> 36:43.414
Some nigga to get you
shoes you like.

36:43.576 --> 36:45.203
Some nigga
to get you bags you like.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.122
All of that stuff.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.428
Yo, what the fuck is this?

36:54.921 --> 36:56.923
You carrying a piece in my shop?

36:57.090 --> 36:59.309
'Keisha, it's our shop.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.725
And it ain't exactly
on the Upper East Side.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.015
- I was protecting us.
- You know how to use that?

37:05.181 --> 37:07.479
Yeah, I do.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.354
Look, I should've told you first.

37:11.521 --> 37:13.401
I won't bring it around
if you don't want me to.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.363
Nah, you know what?
It probably is a good idea.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.241
Let's just keep it out of sight
when our kids are in the shop, okay?

37:18.403 --> 37:19.575
Fair.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.366
You being straight with me?

37:22.532 --> 37:24.660
You just carrying a piece to be safe?

37:25.702 --> 37:28.125
There's nothing else going on, right?

37:28.288 --> 37:30.461
You're my girl.

37:30.623 --> 37:32.876
If there was something going on,
I would tell you.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.044
You know that.

37:41.384 --> 37:43.603
I see you with them kicks,
though, boy.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.311
Leece's punk ass got lit up.

37:46.473 --> 37:48.225
Kicks came flying off.

37:48.391 --> 37:50.231
Motherfuckers was too clean
to go in the trash.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.316
So you hitting up a dead nigga
for some sneakers?

37:52.479 --> 37:54.607
Grimy nigga, dog.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.242
You a grimy nigga. Pass me that.

37:58.067 --> 38:00.507
I notice that tight-ass suit
you got on ain't no hand-me-down.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.081
Ghost got you holding
umbrellas for him?

38:03.239 --> 38:06.118
- Like that Farnsworth Bentley nigga?
- Fuck nah, nigga.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.752
I'm moving up in the ranks.

38:07.911 --> 38:11.165
You know, he's taking me, you know,
to meetings and shit, so it's cool.

38:11.331 --> 38:13.584
Okay, big time.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.673
You finally down for that lick
we talked about?

38:16.920 --> 38:18.638
Nah, I'm good, man.

38:20.673 --> 38:24.098
Since you so loyal to Ghost,
I got something you should know.

38:25.595 --> 38:27.597
My gun guy told me the Koreans
bought some MAC-10s

38:27.764 --> 38:30.204
to smoke some white nigga.
Said they gonna need a new connect.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.813
- What, Tommy?
- No doubt, B.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.445
Ain't no other white niggas
I know in the game.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.153
So what's the problem?

38:38.316 --> 38:40.318
Korean kingpin
found out from Tommy

38:40.485 --> 38:42.885
his kid was stepping on the product
and holding back his cut.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.490
Old man got mad as fuck
and cut off his kid finger.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.830
- Kid want to take out Tommy.
- When's it going down?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.710
Tonight...

38:49.869 --> 38:52.998
at some church or something.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.134
All right, have a good time.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.045
Good to see you. Good luck
with the rest of the season, man.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.632
- Mr. St. Patrick.
- Yeah.

39:02.795 --> 39:04.275
I need to talk to you in your office.

39:04.300 --> 39:05.820
Is it about what we discussed earlier?

39:05.969 --> 39:07.129
No, it's something different.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.818
I need to talk to you
about Karen Bassett.

39:08.843 --> 39:11.062
Look, Dean, I need to take this.
Hold that thought.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.361
Andre, where the fuck are you, man?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.720
We need to talk about
what you pulled in front of Karen.

39:17.745 --> 39:20.317
I'm back on the block.
Yo, we need to talk.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.157
Fuck you doing back on the block?
I told you not to go back there.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.538
- Ghost, listen.
- I'm listening.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.697
Word on the street,
your boy Tommy caught some beef

39:27.859 --> 39:29.219
with the Koreans
over some product.

39:29.244 --> 39:31.044
They gonna light his ass up tonight.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.042
Where?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.333
Some church
where the priest is crooked.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.922
- I never heard of it before.
- I have.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.565
You want me to go
fuck the Koreans up?

39:40.590 --> 39:43.139
Stop this shit before it go down?

39:44.507 --> 39:46.760
No. You get your ass back here.

39:54.434 --> 39:56.857
Pick up, Tommy.

39:58.146 --> 40:01.025
Motherfucker.

40:31.888 --> 40:33.982
How long has it been
since your last confession?

40:34.140 --> 40:35.700
You fucking kidding me?
Come on, Father.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.401
Give me my money.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.448
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, please.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.234
Nobody can see in here.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.869
Believe me, I could wank it.
Mrs. Flaherty would never know.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.911
Youth group's been
working hard pushing product.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.917
That, plus this little side hustle

40:53.076 --> 40:56.250
I got moving guns for
this Albanian dick, Behar,

40:56.412 --> 40:59.131
we almost got enough
saved up for a new roof.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.056
Do you need something else?

41:10.593 --> 41:12.937
I've been asked to do this...

41:13.096 --> 41:15.064
thing.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.818
I don't think I can do it.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.651
- Can you tell me what it is?
- It's a big-time sin.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.783
We're talking
Ten-Commandment-level shit.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.445
There's only...

41:32.073 --> 41:35.418
only one commandment
which really counts.

41:36.285 --> 41:39.664
God doesn't care if you honor
your father and your mother,

41:39.831 --> 41:42.880
but I know you a while,
and something tells me

41:43.042 --> 41:45.122
this wouldn't be your first time
breaking number one.

41:45.169 --> 41:49.219
Guessing it's not what it is
but who it is?

41:51.843 --> 41:54.767
All my life, people had
low expectations of me.

41:55.388 --> 41:58.983
You know, “Think, Tommy."
"What's the plan, Tommy?"

41:59.142 --> 42:01.691
"I got more to offer, Tommy."

42:02.895 --> 42:06.525
And if I don't do this thing here,
then they right about me.

42:06.691 --> 42:09.661
- I can't stand on my own.
- You tried praying about it?

42:10.737 --> 42:12.831
I don't think the big guy'd
recognize my voice.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.162
It's been a minute
since I hit him up.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.543
God is always listening, Tommy.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.831
Sometimes he just doesn't
answer our prayers

42:20.997 --> 42:23.170
the way we expect him to.

42:23.332 --> 42:26.302
You got to ask yourself,
"ls it the right thing to do?

42:27.462 --> 42:30.181

44:16.279 --> 44:18.953

all you had to do was ask.

45:47.203 --> 45:49.626
Tommy, what the fuck
happened to you?

45:50.456 --> 45:52.129
I was leaving a meet.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.293
Some car rolled up on me.

45:55.211 --> 45:57.088
Lit my ass up.

46:00.216 --> 46:01.968
Who did this to you?

46:03.135 --> 46:05.479
It was too dark.
I couldn't see their faces.

46:07.515 --> 46:09.392
It was professional.

46:16.565 --> 46:18.488
It was Lobos.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.916
Don't worry, baby.

46:31.163 --> 46:33.416
Everything's gonna be all right.

46:36.585 --> 46:38.132
Where you going?

46:38.296 --> 46:40.139
To get some bandages and peroxide.

46:40.298 --> 46:42.596
It'll get infected
if we don't take care of it.

47:00.943 --> 47:02.786
Dean, we'll finish
that conversation later.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.164
Thank you.

47:05.781 --> 47:08.000
- Miss Karen.
- Excuse me.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.378
Hey. Welcome.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.540
I have been seeing your face
all over social media.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.458
Well, that is my face.

47:15.624 --> 47:18.298
Now everyone will know
James St. Patrick.

Oh, come on.
The heavy lifting's done.

47:48.491 --> 47:50.091
Thought you'd be doing
a touchdown dance.

47:50.159 --> 47:52.287
No one wants Lobos
more than you.

47:53.496 --> 47:56.625
I just didn't expect
to hear it from Greg.

47:58.084 --> 48:00.507
His involvement in the case
could blow things up.

48:01.462 --> 48:04.181
He hasn't exactly...

48:04.340 --> 48:06.593
colored inside the lines.

48:06.759 --> 48:08.978

48:14.100 --> 48:15.943
or m-maybe it was you,

48:16.102 --> 48:18.776
but at the end of the day,
we all want the same thing...

48:18.938 --> 48:20.440

Hey.

49:08.571 --> 49:10.164
Hi.

49:12.741 --> 49:15.585
Care to join me

49:15.744 --> 49:17.838

49:21.417 --> 49:23.090
You?

49:23.252 --> 49:25.004
Yeah.

49:27.256 --> 49:29.224

49:33.929 --> 49:35.181
You?

49:37.600 --> 49:39.352
No.

49:55.159 --> 49:57.628
Jamie, I don't think
we're gonna make it.

49:57.786 --> 49:59.288
I'm here.

49:59.455 --> 50:01.173
You're here.
We're here together.

50:01.332 --> 50:03.801
- That's what you want.
- I want this to work.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.712
I do, but you're never home.

50:06.879 --> 50:08.222
I'm never home.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.849
What are we doing?
Playing make-believe?

50:11.008 --> 50:13.386
- You're not even divorced.
- I know it's scary,

50:13.552 --> 50:15.654
and I know there's a lot of people
that don't want to see us together,

50:15.679 --> 50:17.397

get in your head.

50:17.556 --> 50:21.982

It's... everything.

50:22.144 --> 50:25.694
Did you ever wonder maybe
everyone else was right

50:25.856 --> 50:28.826
- and we're the ones who are wrong?
- No, I never think that,

50:28.984 --> 50:31.988
and I think that
you should never think that.

50:34.323 --> 50:36.451
I'm not letting you go.
