01:49.055 --> 01:51.523
How many stars
sparkle in the sky?

01:51.925 --> 01:54.359
Ever tried counting them?

01:54.828 --> 02:02.291
lt would take 6,000 years to
count those in our galaxy alone

02:02.803 --> 02:04.930
How many such galaxies exist?

02:05.338 --> 02:08.967
Scientists reckon
two billion more

02:09.476 --> 02:14.709
lsn't it possible that amongst
these billions of celestial bodies

02:14.981 --> 02:18.473
a planet with people
like us exists?

02:18.819 --> 02:22.585
As we explore space
looking for them,

02:22.856 --> 02:27.293
couldn't they be coming here,
looking for us?

04:27.781 --> 04:58.375
Hindi pop song

06:16.790 --> 06:21.318
What the thief stole was the
gadget to recall his spaceship

06:21.494 --> 06:24.986
Without this remote
he could not return home

06:25.432 --> 06:29.766
He neither knew our language,
nor had a friend here

06:30.003 --> 06:33.962
Alone, anguished,
his only thought was...

06:34.441 --> 06:36.341
.. how will l return home?

06:59.032 --> 07:04.231
On the pathway of Time
Life is but a brief flame

07:05.238 --> 07:10.301
ln its luminous mist
We wish, we dream, we exist

07:10.777 --> 07:13.541
But on a beautiful bend

07:13.847 --> 07:16.577
A stranger may we meet

07:16.783 --> 07:19.809
Life after life

07:19.986 --> 07:23.251
Whose memory may persist

07:42.275 --> 07:44.004
Extra ticket.
Anyone extra ticket?

07:44.277 --> 07:46.472
- Yes sir...

07:47.280 --> 07:48.941
Sorry, I raised my hand first

07:49.015 --> 07:51.779
But I caIIed out first

07:51.918 --> 07:54.887
I'm a big fan of
Mr Bachchan, the poet

07:54.954 --> 07:57.718
I'm a bigger fan of his son,
the actor

07:57.991 --> 08:00.789
From age ten, I know aII his poems.
FuIIy memorized

08:01.227 --> 08:04.219
From age five, I know his son's
diaIogues - without memorizing

08:04.264 --> 08:05.959
HeIIo, who wants it?

08:06.366 --> 08:08.698
Give me.
Poetry's not his cup of tea

08:08.968 --> 08:10.265
€100

08:10.703 --> 08:14.230
€100 for a €40 ticket?

08:14.374 --> 08:16.433
Queued up

08:16.676 --> 08:17.904
Time is money

08:24.884 --> 08:29.719

08:30.790 --> 08:33.520

10:42.021 --> 10:45.354
OIdies these days!
It's a spoiIt generation!

10:45.591 --> 10:48.424
Forget it

10:48.661 --> 10:49.628
How can I?

10:50.063 --> 10:52.531
That bandit basks in poetry
and here I am

10:52.598 --> 10:53.587
Drop it

10:55.335 --> 10:58.327
Why pine for the party
that shuns us?

10:58.604 --> 11:01.767
Follow the moment
that beckons us

11:02.275 --> 11:04.436
I too dabbIe in poetry

11:04.711 --> 11:06.508
It's nice. Go on

11:07.747 --> 11:13.549
No. If I go on,
you'II propose to me

11:14.821 --> 11:16.812
- You crazy?
- I mean it!

11:17.523 --> 11:19.354
Your favorite poet,
senior Mr Bachchan

11:19.525 --> 11:22.289
met a Iady one morning,
wooed her with verse

11:22.595 --> 11:24.859
By dusk they were married.
So I've read

11:25.031 --> 11:26.396
ReaIIy?

11:26.766 --> 11:29.462
And boy!
Look what they produced -

11:29.736 --> 11:31.829
Amitabh Bachchan -
the great actor

11:33.740 --> 11:34.638
Jaggu

11:35.308 --> 11:36.036
Jaggu?

11:36.776 --> 11:37.765
My name

11:38.011 --> 11:41.378
Papa named me Jagat Janani:
world's mother

11:41.681 --> 11:45.674
I got mocked at schooI
so I shortened it - Jaggu

11:46.019 --> 11:47.748
- From Mumbai?
- No. DeIhi

11:47.954 --> 11:49.683
I'm studying TV production

11:49.822 --> 11:50.880
And you?

11:51.324 --> 11:53.986
Sarfaraz. I study architecture

11:54.694 --> 11:57.356
and work part time
at the Pakistan Embassy

11:57.730 --> 11:59.664
Pakistan Embassy? Why?

12:00.033 --> 12:02.263
WeII, I'm from Pakistan

12:02.468 --> 12:05.904
UnIikeIy the Indian Embassy
wiII empIoy me!

12:08.408 --> 12:09.739
What's wrong?

12:10.443 --> 12:11.705
Nothing

12:15.515 --> 12:20.543
My being from Pakistan
perturbs you?

12:22.889 --> 12:24.550
AIright then

12:24.991 --> 12:26.925
Goodbye

12:42.542 --> 12:48.606
Ask not my name,
nor my country

12:49.449 --> 12:54.978
From bondage of
borders break free

12:56.022 --> 13:01.551
A few steps
on this brief journey

13:02.295 --> 13:07.494
Come,

13:17.577 --> 13:21.308

borders break free

13:25.551 --> 13:29.419
A few steps
on this brief journey

13:29.755 --> 13:32.883
Come,
just walk with me

13:33.726 --> 13:37.321
Past the realms of
word and speech

13:37.763 --> 13:40.755
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

13:41.767 --> 13:45.294
A few steps
on this brief journey

13:45.771 --> 13:48.501
Come,
just walk with me

13:49.308 --> 13:53.039
Past the realms of
word and speech

13:53.813 --> 13:56.873
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

13:57.950 --> 14:01.511
A few steps
on this brief journey

14:01.854 --> 14:05.756
Come,
just walk with me

14:25.845 --> 14:29.576
lf the sun scorches
the pathway

14:29.882 --> 14:33.318
A carpet of shade
will l lay

14:33.786 --> 14:37.586
lf darkness
fills you with dismay

14:37.890 --> 14:41.485
l'll conjure up
a moon in the sky

14:41.894 --> 14:45.591
lf dejection fills up
your day

14:45.932 --> 14:49.459
With laughter
l'll shoo it away

14:49.936 --> 14:53.633
Laughing, frolicking,
humming a song

14:53.906 --> 14:57.398
Together we shall
walk along

15:15.728 --> 15:19.357
With you,
my fellow traveler

15:19.699 --> 15:22.566
Nothing in this world l fear

15:27.740 --> 15:30.903
With you l'll walk along

15:31.510 --> 15:35.378
Past the realms of
word and speech

15:35.681 --> 15:38.946
Hand in hand,
nowhere to reach

15:39.685 --> 15:43.416
A few steps
on this brief journey

15:43.723 --> 15:47.523
Come,

16:29.268 --> 16:31.259
- Thank you

16:36.475 --> 16:38.636
FaIIen in Iove?

16:39.278 --> 16:40.404
He's so cute!

16:40.813 --> 16:41.973
More photos pIease!

16:42.448 --> 16:44.939
What's his job?
What's his famiIy Iike?

16:45.584 --> 16:47.484
CaIm down Mom.
I'II teII you

16:47.720 --> 16:49.711
First, the name

16:50.022 --> 16:51.580
Sarfaraz

16:51.957 --> 16:53.788
MusIim?

16:54.527 --> 16:58.293
Yes. Studies architecture.
FamiIy is in Pakistan

16:58.464 --> 17:00.694
Pakistan!
Which Pakistan?

17:00.933 --> 17:02.491
There's just
one Pakistan, Mom

17:02.702 --> 17:03.566
You'II wear burkhas?

17:03.836 --> 17:05.861
Read the Quran?
Have you gone mad?

17:06.005 --> 17:08.872
Don't you disconnect.
Stay put

17:09.241 --> 17:10.502
Start the car

17:10.776 --> 17:12.743
AII's doomed, Your HoIiness.
HeIp!

17:13.311 --> 17:15.803
l knew exactly
where Papa was headed

17:16.248 --> 17:20.617
Since childhood one face had
surrounded us.: His Holiness

17:20.786 --> 17:22.446
Bye Mom

17:23.255 --> 17:25.916
From bags to bathroom walls,

17:26.325 --> 17:29.317
he was omnipresent

17:30.396 --> 17:35.265
Even for a root canal
he would set the auspicious time

17:36.769 --> 17:41.729
He had gifted Papa a God box
with a deity for every task

17:42.808 --> 17:46.710
Goddess of Wealth
for the stock market

17:47.780 --> 17:51.773
God of Health for workouts

17:52.418 --> 17:55.615
Web-based worship and
sacred sweets by courier

17:55.821 --> 17:59.882
were his innovations

18:03.796 --> 18:06.822
HaiI, Your HoIiness

18:08.868 --> 18:10.358
HaiI, Your HoIiness

18:12.438 --> 18:14.804
Touch his feet Jaggu

18:24.417 --> 18:28.251
Why this fataI infatuation?

18:28.587 --> 18:31.818
Pick up a pen and write

18:32.324 --> 18:33.621
God

18:34.593 --> 18:36.390
EnIighten me

18:41.000 --> 18:42.558
Yes...

18:43.969 --> 18:45.300
Yes...

18:46.338 --> 18:48.670
Your wish is our command

18:49.375 --> 18:51.343
Write down the prophecy

18:51.644 --> 18:53.703
This Pakistani boy,

18:53.979 --> 18:55.571
Sarfaraz,

18:56.849 --> 18:58.282
wiII betray you

18:58.484 --> 19:00.611
I know he won't

19:02.288 --> 19:08.693
History stands witness:
these peopIe scheme and betray

19:08.894 --> 19:12.557
He wiII pursue
carnaI pIeasures

19:12.665 --> 19:15.896
But wiII never marry you.
He'II vanish

19:16.302 --> 19:20.898
Come home now! One more
night there, and you're dead to us

19:20.973 --> 19:23.908
Mr Sahni,
I'II taIk to her

19:24.477 --> 19:27.935
ChiId, hit the deIete button

19:28.514 --> 19:31.506
Banish him
from your system

19:35.721 --> 19:37.279
HeIIo!

19:39.558 --> 19:40.923
What happened?

19:42.528 --> 19:44.291
Do you Iove me?

19:44.797 --> 19:46.458
Of course I do. Why?

19:47.333 --> 19:50.268
- WiII you marry me?
- What's the matter?

19:50.402 --> 19:51.391
Yes or no, Sarfaraz?

19:51.670 --> 19:53.570
- Yes, but...
- Tomorrow

19:53.839 --> 19:54.806
Tomorrow?

19:55.508 --> 19:57.635
Tomorrow we get married

19:58.811 --> 20:02.338
His prophecy is wrong.
I'II prove it

20:15.528 --> 20:18.520
Mr James Herrick and
Miss Oprah Brown, you're next

20:18.797 --> 20:21.732
- James isn't here, yet.
- Oh, taIk to the registrar

20:22.701 --> 20:24.498
CouId you just

20:24.770 --> 20:25.964
- Yes of course.
- Thank you

20:27.439 --> 20:28.701
HeIIo...

20:30.509 --> 20:31.771
This is for you

20:32.511 --> 20:33.944
- For me?
- Yeah

20:34.446 --> 20:35.811
Thank you

20:40.686 --> 20:41.880
lt was from Sarfaraz

20:42.488 --> 20:45.548
He said.: marriage isn't just
between individuals, but families

20:45.925 --> 20:48.894
Our faiths, countries,
cultures are different

20:49.428 --> 20:51.862
We can never be happy
if our families are unhappy

20:52.031 --> 20:54.465
Don't try to contact me

20:54.700 --> 20:56.065
l'm sorry

21:16.822 --> 21:18.483
Where to go young Iady?

21:19.291 --> 21:19.916
New DeIhi

21:24.296 --> 21:28.323
l came back to my city, but
my parents refused to see me

21:28.534 --> 21:30.468
l joined a news channel
as a reporter

21:30.736 --> 21:32.897
Today's story:
a depressed dog

21:33.305 --> 21:34.567
That's our breaking news!

21:34.907 --> 21:38.468
Some days we had news,
some days we fabricated it

21:58.864 --> 22:01.992
Missing: God

22:02.935 --> 22:05.699
If found, contact Tipsy

22:09.475 --> 22:11.875
There's a story in this man.
I'II see you at office

22:12.277 --> 22:13.869
Don't be Iate!

22:27.459 --> 22:28.551
Excuse me?

22:28.927 --> 22:30.554
Why are you
handing these out?

22:31.330 --> 22:33.298
I have a case
pending with Him

22:33.532 --> 22:35.500
He neither soIves it,
nor meets me

22:35.801 --> 22:37.996
My Iife is kaput

22:39.304 --> 22:41.829
He's gone into hiding

22:43.308 --> 22:45.538
Have you seen Him around?

22:46.545 --> 22:48.342
No

22:50.916 --> 22:59.483
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

22:59.658 --> 23:03.924
Hail Goddess,
Hail Holy Mother

23:04.329 --> 23:06.524
By the way,
what's with the heImet?

23:06.865 --> 23:08.799
Got the idea from taxi-tops

23:09.301 --> 23:11.895
YeIIow yeIIs out from miIes

23:12.337 --> 23:15.329
Taxis are spotted
easiIy in traffic

23:15.741 --> 23:19.268
- So?
- So God can spot me easy!

23:19.545 --> 23:23.641
How eIse wiII he spot me
in this crowd?

23:31.857 --> 23:34.382
A bit to your Ieft - perfect!

23:34.593 --> 23:35.855
Ok, background?

23:36.462 --> 23:37.793
Cue Jaggu

23:38.664 --> 23:41.497
They say
animaIs are not suicidaI

23:41.834 --> 23:45.930
Here's Nikku.
Mr Sweetie Singh's dog

23:46.605 --> 23:50.041
Nikku has attempted
suicide thrice

23:50.309 --> 23:55.838
Jumping off a roof, Iicking sIeeping
piIIs, hopping onto a gas burner

23:56.315 --> 23:58.340
What's wrong with Nikku?

23:58.450 --> 24:01.578
Is Nikku prey to a
mentaI probIem?

24:02.287 --> 24:03.584
Is Nikku...

24:05.758 --> 24:07.487
What's wrong Jaggu?

24:07.893 --> 24:09.622
What is this shit, Mitu?

24:13.866 --> 24:17.358
Our chat with famed industriaIist
Mr Ratan continues

24:17.436 --> 24:19.267
right after this break

24:20.572 --> 24:22.802
Going weII, Ratan?
Some coffee?

24:23.275 --> 24:24.537
Get him some coffee

24:24.710 --> 24:26.769
- Cherry...
- Oh no!

24:26.912 --> 24:30.370
What's your guess? This dog has
depression, anxiety disorder,

24:30.582 --> 24:33.813
schizophrenia, or ADHD?

24:34.353 --> 24:35.945
Whatever,
why wouId I care?

24:36.288 --> 24:37.277
ExactIy

24:37.489 --> 24:42.290
Why wouId anyone care?
Then why do we air such buII?

24:42.995 --> 24:44.826
What wouId you rather air?

24:44.963 --> 24:47.295
HoId him pIease

24:49.001 --> 24:50.025
See this?

24:50.435 --> 24:53.495
I met a guy distributing
these pamphIets

24:53.872 --> 24:56.636
- He is searching for God.
- Found Him?

24:57.309 --> 24:58.799
No... but

24:58.911 --> 25:03.245
Searching for God - that's reIigion.
Finding God - that's news

25:03.282 --> 25:05.750
If he finds God, get him.
I'II put him on air

25:05.984 --> 25:07.815
You know the Company poIicy

25:08.253 --> 25:10.551
No news on reIigion,
no news on God. Finished

25:11.256 --> 25:12.450
Man, you've changed!

25:12.825 --> 25:14.884
Where's the fighter,
Cherry Bajwa?

25:15.394 --> 25:17.760
You wanna see the fighter?

25:18.397 --> 25:19.864
Take a good Iook

25:20.432 --> 25:22.798
There are three marks here

25:23.368 --> 25:24.801
These aren't birthmarks

25:24.937 --> 25:29.340
I ran a show against His HoIiness,
your Dad's Guru

25:29.608 --> 25:32.839
His devotees shoved a trident
right here in my bum

25:33.345 --> 25:35.745
Anchor coming to you
in 10 seconds

25:35.881 --> 25:38.475
That day I swore -
if you want to Iive in this country

25:38.750 --> 25:40.445
don't mess with reIigion.
That's it

25:40.586 --> 25:42.554
- l've got a show to run now.
- 5... 4...

25:42.654 --> 25:43.279

WeIcome back from the break

25:46.792 --> 25:49.818
We were chatting with
famed industriaIist Mr Ratan...

25:50.028 --> 25:52.895
The boss killed my story

25:53.298 --> 25:57.291
But it came back to life
two weeks later

26:37.476 --> 26:39.603
[ DONATION BOX ]

26:45.550 --> 26:47.450

26:47.786 --> 26:51.779

27:09.574 --> 27:10.939
Don't Iet him go!

27:18.450 --> 27:20.941

27:21.253 --> 27:21.742

27:52.851 --> 27:54.614

were you up to?

28:03.962 --> 28:05.395
CIaiming my refund

28:05.564 --> 28:07.464
God took His fee
but didn't deIiver

28:07.532 --> 28:09.227
Hang on...

28:09.701 --> 28:13.660
I saw you fish out some money,
then put some back in

28:13.739 --> 28:18.574
I took back what I'd paid
at this branch. Returned the rest

28:19.578 --> 28:21.705
You used to wear
beads and amuIets?

28:21.780 --> 28:23.839
Rejected. Gone for good

28:24.349 --> 28:26.840
Why the stickers then?

28:27.419 --> 28:29.580

28:30.322 --> 28:33.314
God pics on waIIs - prevent peeing

28:33.558 --> 28:36.686
on face - prevent punches

28:42.667 --> 28:44.259

28:44.503 --> 28:46.869
Pick me up.
I've no money to get home

28:56.415 --> 28:57.780
Here you go

28:58.283 --> 29:01.309

- For the ride home

29:01.653 --> 29:06.249
When someone can't
get home, I feeI sad

29:07.893 --> 29:11.260
- Wait.

29:13.932 --> 29:17.834
- Why?
- Won't you need it to get home?

29:22.441 --> 29:26.241
Money can't get me home

29:26.378 --> 29:29.313
Why? Where do you Iive?

I want your story.
WiII you share it?

32:21.886 --> 32:22.750
Why?

32:23.021 --> 32:26.320
I'm a TV reporter.
It's my job

32:38.870 --> 32:43.705
- Go on, ask.
- Awesome!

32:48.513 --> 32:50.743
Your name?

32:51.616 --> 32:53.516
Don't have a name

32:53.618 --> 32:56.314
They caII me Tipsy here.
Beats me why

32:56.388 --> 32:58.754
And what do you do?

33:00.992 --> 33:03.392
I'm an astronaut

33:04.963 --> 33:06.555
Astronaut!

33:06.831 --> 33:09.265
Those who shoot off
to the moon?

33:09.567 --> 33:12.764
Been there once.
lt's kaput

33:14.439 --> 33:15.963
Sure!

33:16.641 --> 33:18.438
So what's your
favorite pIanet?

33:18.510 --> 33:21.479
- My own.
- I meant besides Earth?

33:21.713 --> 33:23.738
Earth is mega-kaput

33:23.982 --> 33:26.542
I meant my own pIanet

33:30.288 --> 33:34.281
It'II show up there at night

33:34.759 --> 33:36.989
We went bananas,

33:37.462 --> 33:42.399
when we found another pIanet
with peopIe Iike us

33:42.967 --> 33:45.527
I was sent here
on a research mission

33:45.670 --> 33:47.570
Boy, what a weIcome I got!

33:47.839 --> 33:50.000
My remote got robbed

33:50.842 --> 33:54.369
Without it,
I can't signaI my peopIe

33:54.446 --> 33:57.574
and without a signaI
they won't come for me

33:57.882 --> 34:00.544
They'II think
it's a periIous pIanet

34:00.719 --> 34:03.347
That I'm dead as a dodo

34:07.792 --> 34:08.588
HeIIo!

34:08.827 --> 34:10.260
- Listen...
- What?

34:10.527 --> 34:11.995
Let me out.
I want to go home

34:12.429 --> 34:16.389
Your Highness, convicts
don't decide that. Cops do

34:16.568 --> 34:17.933
I'm not a thief

34:18.268 --> 34:19.668
So say aII the thieves

34:19.971 --> 34:22.273
Where's officer Pandey?

34:22.273 --> 34:23.797
Out on his rounds

34:24.542 --> 34:26.271
Officer Pandey!

34:27.379 --> 34:27.844
Officer Pandey!

34:27.911 --> 34:30.972
Shut up, or you get
a knuckIe sandwich

34:50.735 --> 34:53.568
You think
I'm taIking baIoney?

34:54.304 --> 34:55.772
ObviousIy!

34:56.306 --> 34:58.468
Is Hindi the officiaI Ianguage
of your pIanet?

34:58.576 --> 35:00.373
On our pIanet...

35:00.945 --> 35:03.641
.. there's no Ianguage!

35:03.948 --> 35:06.644
We read minds.
There's no confusion

35:06.885 --> 35:09.854
Here, you utter something
and mean something eIse

35:09.921 --> 35:12.287
A two-Ietter word can have
four different meanings

35:12.724 --> 35:17.525
When you nod and say ''oh'',
it means ''Oh, that's cooI''

35:18.797 --> 35:21.994
When your eyes pop out,
''oh!'' means bad news

35:22.434 --> 35:25.267
''Your mother-in-Iaw
is moving in.'' ''Oh!''

35:26.337 --> 35:28.737
When angry, you thunder

35:29.007 --> 35:32.465
''Oh! You'II pay
for that bIunder!''

35:32.811 --> 35:35.712
And when your thought is deep,
your ''oh'' is Iong!

35:36.548 --> 35:38.880
''Ohhhhhhh! I see!''

35:39.818 --> 35:43.015
As you hear the words,
you gotta watch the expression

35:43.288 --> 35:45.279
to get the reaI meaning

35:45.356 --> 35:49.486
It's torture!
Took fuII 6 hours to Iearn Hindi

35:49.627 --> 35:52.721
A whoIe Ianguage in 6 hours?

35:52.797 --> 35:55.391
No one Iet me hoId hands

35:55.834 --> 35:57.961
FinaIIy, a nice Iady
Ient her hand

35:58.036 --> 36:01.904
I heId it and transferred
her Ianguage into my system

36:01.973 --> 36:06.842
Man, there's no Iimit
to your whoppers!

36:06.945 --> 36:09.470
Is your hand a USB cabIe,

36:09.747 --> 36:13.478
that transfers fiIes
between computers?

36:13.785 --> 36:17.516
And your cIothes? Are faded jeans
the rage on your pIanet too?

36:17.689 --> 36:19.247
Noooo!

36:19.524 --> 36:20.650
On our pIanet...

36:20.892 --> 36:24.919
.. no one wears cIothes.
There we go bare

36:25.396 --> 36:28.263
Here, at first I thought

36:28.766 --> 36:32.258
your skins were
different from ours

36:32.770 --> 36:34.931
Some had sparkly hides,

36:35.273 --> 36:37.867
some jet black

36:38.943 --> 36:41.912
Some hides were colorful,
some white

36:42.847 --> 36:46.840
Some hides sticky-tight,
some baggy

36:48.887 --> 36:51.788
Then one day
l found a car

36:52.023 --> 36:53.388
A dancing car

36:59.597 --> 37:04.967
That day l realized
our skins were the same

37:05.370 --> 37:10.239
but yours are covered
with a thing called fashion

37:15.513 --> 37:18.277
Radio CommerciaI

37:18.449 --> 37:21.714
Now l could mingle

37:21.986 --> 37:25.717
Yet l was mocked

37:26.524 --> 37:29.823
Look here -
haIf man, haIf woman!

37:30.995 --> 37:32.587
Slowly l got it

37:32.730 --> 37:35.756
There's man - fashion
and woman - fashion

37:36.568 --> 37:37.830
There was day fashion...

37:38.269 --> 37:39.759
.. and night fashion

37:40.271 --> 37:41.499
Sporting fashion...

37:41.539 --> 37:43.302
.. and serving fashion

37:46.311 --> 37:50.270
With the clothes,
l found some photos

38:02.594 --> 38:07.964
lt hit me - these photos
meant survival

38:08.766 --> 38:11.564
You could
swap them for food

38:11.736 --> 38:15.228
So l built a portfolio
of this old man's photos

38:30.822 --> 38:32.585
What's this?

38:36.728 --> 38:38.992
What are these for?

38:41.499 --> 38:44.593
Why are you giving me
this junk?

38:47.271 --> 38:49.603
Right! Now we're taIking!

38:49.874 --> 38:51.637
Here you go

38:52.644 --> 38:56.774
l got it.: this photo had value
on just one kind of paper

38:57.315 --> 39:01.513
On any other paper,
it was worthless

39:03.721 --> 39:07.282
For cash and clothes,
dancing cars were widely available

39:07.425 --> 39:10.485
They were my bank,
they were my tailor!

39:12.330 --> 39:14.628
Once, l got
such magnetic attire

39:14.866 --> 39:17.835
that no photos
were needed

39:17.902 --> 39:20.234
Food was pulled to me

39:20.405 --> 39:22.236
For you, Sir

39:24.475 --> 39:28.434
Now, to find my remote, l had to
learn this planet's language

39:28.613 --> 39:31.707
Without it,
every task was a trial

39:32.250 --> 39:33.774
Like telling this gentleman

39:33.918 --> 39:37.547
there was a defect
in his fashion

39:44.429 --> 39:47.694
l felt l had spoilt his fashion

39:49.367 --> 39:52.393
So l put it back
where it was

40:13.424 --> 40:19.385
[Radio Announcement]

40:23.301 --> 40:24.768
Found him on the road

40:25.436 --> 40:27.495
Some scumbag
hit him and boIted

40:28.306 --> 40:30.331
Seems pretty okay,

40:31.509 --> 40:33.602
but isn't responding

40:34.445 --> 40:36.743
Has his eardrum
caIIed it a day?

40:37.048 --> 40:38.982
Are you deaf?

40:39.517 --> 40:42.918
Can hear aIright,
but isn't taIking

40:43.621 --> 40:45.816
Seems in a state of shock

40:46.057 --> 40:49.322
Memory Ioss, I'm afraid

40:59.837 --> 41:02.806
Remember the scumbag

41:05.009 --> 41:07.409
Remember the Iicense pIate?

41:08.546 --> 41:11.743

41:53.357 --> 41:58.659
One knock took your memory away,
another might bring it back

41:58.863 --> 42:00.455
Seen it in the movies

42:00.531 --> 42:02.863
To figure what he was
yapping about,

42:02.934 --> 42:07.303
l had to hold his hand
and transfer his language

42:09.574 --> 42:11.269
Hey!

42:12.844 --> 42:16.280
With memory Ioss your gender
sense went for a toss?

42:16.514 --> 42:17.412
Wait a moment...

42:18.482 --> 42:19.881

42:27.625 --> 42:32.619
To return home

44:20.905 --> 44:24.272
From Mumbai, Madrid

44:24.342 --> 44:31.339
What was your name at school
Was it nerdy or was it cool?

44:31.515 --> 44:38.284
What was your name at school
Was it nerdy or was it cool?

44:38.556 --> 44:42.014
What's the zip code
Of your abode

44:42.393 --> 44:45.760
Did you alight from a cloud
Or sprout from underground

44:45.830 --> 44:49.459
Your frantic antics if not stilled,

45:21.499 --> 45:24.866
Feuds forgotten

I feeI your pain, bro

46:43.981 --> 46:45.812
But don't go grabbing hands

46:46.851 --> 46:51.720

47:22.920 --> 47:26.356
All reaching for my hand,
inviting me home

47:26.690 --> 47:30.956
Here l met a serene and
gentle woman, Pepper

47:31.262 --> 47:34.789
Pepper, take him
to the honeymoon suite

48:23.948 --> 48:25.973
Pepper sat patiently all night

48:26.350 --> 48:31.413
For full 6 hours,
l transferred her language files

48:31.855 --> 48:37.350
ABC - XYZ,
l drew in everything

48:47.805 --> 48:52.833
First time?... Kaput before you kicked off?

48:57.982 --> 48:59.973
Y...y... yes!

49:01.385 --> 49:03.819
Where are you from?

49:06.790 --> 49:09.350
Far, far away

49:10.261 --> 49:13.287
From an unheard of viIIage

49:13.497 --> 49:15.931
But you speak my Iingo!

49:16.467 --> 49:21.302
Because I Iearnt it from you,
Sister

49:21.405 --> 49:25.307
Sister! You think
this is a convent? Out!

49:27.444 --> 49:28.274
Bro!

49:29.513 --> 49:31.481
Bro, wake up!

49:32.283 --> 49:33.648
Bro, wake up!

49:34.451 --> 49:35.315
Bro!

49:36.654 --> 49:38.246
You're taIking!

49:38.289 --> 49:40.883
Bro, I need your heIp

49:41.258 --> 49:43.283
Pepper cIeared up your throat!

49:43.460 --> 49:45.257
Bro, come with me quick

49:45.296 --> 49:47.992
Memory and making out
have a direct connection!

49:48.832 --> 49:53.292
Update the docs:
get Iaid, get weII!

49:53.404 --> 49:55.736
It's urgent, bro!

49:55.939 --> 49:56.963
Okay, Iet's go

50:04.281 --> 50:05.612
Stop... stop!

50:05.783 --> 50:07.683
Stop, bro!

50:11.288 --> 50:14.951
The jerk robbed me
right here

50:15.526 --> 50:18.324
I need my chain, bro.
I must get it back

50:18.495 --> 50:20.395
- Precious?
- It's priceIess!

50:20.931 --> 50:23.627
The thief must be a IocaI

50:24.001 --> 50:26.799
But he'II seII
the Ioot in DeIhi

50:26.937 --> 50:30.566
If he soId pricey stuff here,
he'd get caught

50:31.608 --> 50:33.473
Then I must go

50:33.744 --> 50:35.439
Where?

50:36.046 --> 50:37.343
DeIhi

51:01.305 --> 51:02.772
- Officer!
- Yeah?

51:03.374 --> 51:06.434
- My remote controI is stoIen.
- Are you tipsy?

51:06.710 --> 51:09.645
Expect the poIice force
to track your TV remote?

51:10.314 --> 51:12.976
- It's not a TV remote!
- Then?

51:13.951 --> 51:17.387
Can't teII you.
But it's Iike a chain

51:17.454 --> 51:18.853
ReaIIy precious

51:19.289 --> 51:21.780
- Where was it stoIen?
- In Mandawa

51:22.793 --> 51:26.729
And you're searching
in DeIhi, you idiot?

51:27.331 --> 51:28.992
The thief came to DeIhi

51:29.299 --> 51:31.290
- So?
- So where's the thief?

51:31.335 --> 51:34.304
BIockhead!
It's a city of 15 miIIion

51:34.438 --> 51:39.398
PoIice are human,
not God

51:40.811 --> 51:44.440
OnIy God can heIp you

51:45.516 --> 51:50.954
Surrender to God,
you'II succeed

51:51.388 --> 51:55.688
OnIy God knows

51:55.893 --> 51:59.624
Ask God, not me!

52:00.531 --> 52:03.898
Trust in God, my chiId

52:04.368 --> 52:09.738
Who was this God chap?
All said only He could help

52:10.407 --> 52:13.399
What l saw blew my mind

52:13.677 --> 52:17.511
Earthlings had figured out
who had manufactured them!

52:17.881 --> 52:22.284
Their creator lived with them.
He had millions of houses

52:22.519 --> 52:28.856
Earthlings took their problems to Him,
which He solved for a small fee

52:29.393 --> 52:32.954
My planet had no such facility

52:33.397 --> 52:38.334
l could not believe it!
So decided to test it

52:40.337 --> 52:42.328
One take-away God

52:42.372 --> 52:45.739
Which one?
Rs 20, 100, 500?

52:46.310 --> 52:49.609
Any difference?
In the Rs 20 and Rs 500 ones?

52:49.813 --> 52:51.872
Just the size.
Otherwise ditto

52:51.949 --> 52:55.544
Rs 20 God is
equaIIy efficient?

52:56.587 --> 53:00.318
OK, gimme Rs15!
Nothing Iess

53:13.003 --> 53:17.406
God, I am famished.
Get me some food pIease

53:29.386 --> 53:30.876
l went bananas

53:31.455 --> 53:35.414
God actually worked!
Now l could go home

53:35.492 --> 53:38.484
God, my remote is stoIen

53:38.729 --> 53:41.857
PIease find it.
I want to go home

53:55.312 --> 53:59.408
God's battery died.
Worked once, then kaput

53:59.483 --> 54:00.916
What do you mean?

54:00.984 --> 54:03.452
Stick a new battery in.
Where does it go?

54:03.520 --> 54:06.614
- It needs no battery.
- Then why is it off?

54:06.924 --> 54:10.621
- Manufacturing defect?
- I make no defective stuff

54:11.695 --> 54:16.462
- You made this God?
- Of course! With my own hands

54:16.967 --> 54:19.936
You made God,
or God made you?

54:20.270 --> 54:25.298
He made us aII -
I onIy make His statues

54:25.442 --> 54:27.603
Why the statues?

54:27.711 --> 54:31.545
To worship Him.
To voice our probIems

54:31.848 --> 54:36.308
Is there a transmitter inside?
How can He hear us?

54:37.287 --> 54:41.883
God needs no transmitter.
He hears directIy

54:41.959 --> 54:44.928
DirectIy?
Then why the statue?

54:45.329 --> 54:47.797
What's with him?

54:48.732 --> 54:52.532
Want to bust my business?
What's your probIem?

54:53.337 --> 54:55.305
My remote is stoIen, Sir

54:55.472 --> 54:58.737
I'm requesting God.
But He doesn't repIy

54:59.309 --> 55:01.277
- Are you tipsy?
- Meaning?

55:01.311 --> 55:04.439
You're overIoading
this pint-sized God

55:04.481 --> 55:07.245
His itty-bitty feet
can't chase the thief

55:07.351 --> 55:10.377
Bother the big God
inside the tempIe

55:10.787 --> 55:13.278
He'II run fast

55:13.323 --> 55:16.884
Offer Him coconut and money -
He'II deIiver

55:16.960 --> 55:18.894
That'II be Rs 200

55:24.434 --> 55:28.632
Earthlings waited with fees
to get their work done

55:28.972 --> 55:31.770
Full 2 hours later
l got the appointment

55:31.942 --> 55:33.432
God,

55:34.978 --> 55:38.470
pIease get my remote back

55:40.484 --> 55:42.543
- Where is it?
- Move!

55:42.753 --> 55:44.618
Wait,
He didn't deIiver my stuff

55:44.921 --> 55:49.358
He didn't deIiver!
See, I paid His fee

55:49.426 --> 55:51.417
- Your work wiII be done.
- But when?

55:51.495 --> 55:53.895
Can't say when,
but it wiII be done

55:54.031 --> 55:56.829
- Move on.
- But when wiII I get it?

55:56.900 --> 55:58.595
Don't bIock the Iine, scram!

55:58.702 --> 56:01.398
If I scram,
someone eIse may get it

56:01.471 --> 56:02.301
Are you tipsy?

56:02.372 --> 56:06.274
Lady, pIease!
Where wiII I get my stuff?

56:06.343 --> 56:08.243
At the mentaI hospitaI!

56:08.345 --> 56:12.247
What? Cash here,
deIivery at mentaI hospitaI!

56:12.282 --> 56:14.512
- Throw him out!
- OK, give me a receipt

56:14.618 --> 56:15.380
Out!

56:15.485 --> 56:18.784
Without a receipt
how do I cIaim my deIivery?

56:18.855 --> 56:21.346
Get out!

56:21.425 --> 56:22.585
But my remote?

56:22.726 --> 56:23.886
Leave!

56:31.802 --> 56:34.566
I can't find my shoes

56:35.005 --> 56:38.304
Someone's taken them.
Now you take your pick

56:38.608 --> 56:41.543
Rotation is routine
at tempIes

56:54.891 --> 56:59.453
He took the payment,
didn't deIiver

57:03.366 --> 57:04.628
What's his name?

57:04.701 --> 57:06.828
- They caII Him God
- ReaI name?

57:07.304 --> 57:08.737
No idea

57:10.407 --> 57:11.567
Where does he Iive?

57:12.342 --> 57:14.333
In that tempIe

57:14.544 --> 57:18.344
- You handed him the cash?
- No. Put it in His box

57:18.415 --> 57:20.975
- Said he'd do the job?
- He says nothing

57:21.251 --> 57:22.741
Is he mute?

57:22.919 --> 57:24.614
Perhaps... maybe

57:25.255 --> 57:26.779
Oh...

57:28.425 --> 57:30.484
Describe him

57:33.296 --> 57:35.264
Ditto

57:36.967 --> 57:39.527
But a bigger chap

57:40.504 --> 57:41.766
Come near...

57:43.673 --> 57:45.004
Are you tipsy?

57:45.809 --> 57:48.607
Yes.
How do you aII know?

57:48.712 --> 57:52.375
Think I'm a jackass?
20 years a cop!

57:52.482 --> 57:55.474
Who's tipsy who's not
I can teII in a snap

57:56.520 --> 57:59.489
Frisk him

58:00.957 --> 58:03.482
Let me have a Iook

58:04.895 --> 58:06.658
Dr D'MeIIo...

58:07.397 --> 58:12.300
Doc, why get so buzzed
you forget your faith?

58:12.502 --> 58:16.370
Mistook tempIe for a church!
Wanna rouse a riot?

58:16.907 --> 58:21.401
Go to church.
To your own God

58:23.446 --> 58:25.243
Church?

59:13.630 --> 59:14.961
Get out of here

59:15.265 --> 59:18.257
My stuff!
My remote!

59:18.535 --> 59:21.663
God was crucified for your sins.
UngratefuI man!

59:22.239 --> 59:26.232
Crucified! When?

59:26.509 --> 59:29.876
2,000 years ago.
For your sins!

59:30.480 --> 59:33.574
What did I do?
I just got here

59:35.318 --> 59:37.377
- Are you tipsy?
- Yes!

59:37.454 --> 59:40.252
God is watching you.
Behave

59:40.824 --> 59:42.451
Where?

59:42.726 --> 59:43.988
Where is God?

59:44.527 --> 59:45.994
What's in the mug?

59:46.263 --> 59:47.560
Wine

59:47.797 --> 59:51.699
Wine!
Now l got it!

59:52.569 --> 59:55.299
God was bored of
coconut water

59:55.505 --> 59:59.373
Now He preferred wine.
But wine was expensive

59:59.576 --> 01:00:01.601
So l had to muster money

01:00:03.346 --> 01:00:07.840
l got some from the dancing car,
some from a gentleman

01:00:08.285 --> 01:00:10.845
who held out a bowl
of dole everyday

01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:14.482
You could withdraw
as per need

01:00:25.902 --> 01:00:31.397
[Radio Announcement]

01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:36.770
Sir, any God house
around here?

01:00:36.913 --> 01:00:38.881
Right there

01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:48.048
Preacher, Iet me drink
in God's abode

01:00:51.695 --> 01:00:58.464
Or show me a pIace
where there is no God

01:00:59.402 --> 01:01:01.870
Stop!
What's that?

01:01:02.305 --> 01:01:04.273
Wine, for God

01:01:04.574 --> 01:01:06.474
Where is He?

01:01:46.649 --> 01:01:48.844
This lady looked very sad

01:01:49.319 --> 01:01:51.981
To know why,
l grabbed her hand

01:01:52.422 --> 01:01:54.788
Hitting on a widow,
you Iech!

01:01:55.025 --> 01:01:57.357
Widow?
How do you know?

01:01:57.494 --> 01:01:59.485
Don't you see
she's cIad in white?

01:02:11.341 --> 01:02:12.330
Is everything fine?

01:02:12.409 --> 01:02:14.400
Everything is fine.

01:02:15.545 --> 01:02:17.479
Just reIax. SmiIe.

01:02:18.848 --> 01:02:21.510
So sorry
your husband's dead

01:02:21.584 --> 01:02:22.915
- What?
- When?

01:02:23.286 --> 01:02:26.278
How do I know?
You are cIad in white

01:02:26.356 --> 01:02:28.290
Brides wear white!

01:02:28.358 --> 01:02:30.952
No, widows wear white

01:02:31.327 --> 01:02:32.726
Widows wear bIack,
stupid!

01:02:32.796 --> 01:02:35.924
Now don't
stress her out. Go!

01:02:45.942 --> 01:02:48.433
AII three Iost your husbands?

01:02:48.778 --> 01:02:50.973
I'm aIive you moron!
Want a whack?

01:02:52.649 --> 01:02:54.776
After many whacks,
l learnt

01:02:54.851 --> 01:02:58.446
there wasn't one God.
There were many Gods

01:02:58.555 --> 01:03:00.853
Each with His own
set of rules

01:03:01.324 --> 01:03:03.588
Each God had floated
His own Company

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.251
They called it religion

01:03:06.596 --> 01:03:09.690
Each Company had
its own agents

01:03:09.899 --> 01:03:14.927
All Earthlings belonged to
some religion

01:03:15.405 --> 01:03:19.899
and followed the God
of that religion alone

01:03:20.577 --> 01:03:24.274
What was my religion,
who was my God?

01:03:24.781 --> 01:03:27.614
To find the remote
l had to know my God

01:03:43.466 --> 01:03:45.400
What are you doing?

01:03:45.635 --> 01:03:47.296
Where is the IabeI?

01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:49.335
What IabeI?

01:03:49.806 --> 01:03:51.467
The ReIigion IabeI

01:03:52.408 --> 01:03:54.933
How do you know which
Company he beIongs to?

01:03:55.578 --> 01:03:58.046
Where does God
IabeI them?

01:03:58.748 --> 01:03:59.715
Security!

01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:09.748
Finding my religion
was tough

01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:15.262
So l decided to
worship all Gods

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:19.265
One of them would be
my God, who'd help me

01:04:19.469 --> 01:04:25.772
lt's You who governs
The world l hear

01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:31.942
Do listen to my plea
My home beckons me

01:04:32.448 --> 01:04:37.613
God where are You

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:44.989
Tell me where are You

01:04:46.296 --> 01:04:52.792
You guide back to sanity
Those who've lost their way

01:04:52.869 --> 01:04:58.933
l too am completely lost
Guide me too, l pray

01:04:59.442 --> 01:05:04.470
God where are You

01:05:05.949 --> 01:05:11.819
Tell me where are You

01:05:39.582 --> 01:05:42.574
Shall l worship You
in temples

01:05:42.986 --> 01:05:45.955
ln mosques
do my faith l show

01:05:46.389 --> 01:05:52.385
Or to a gurudwara
would You like me to go

01:05:52.996 --> 01:05:59.629
Temples and churches,
l looked everywhere

01:05:59.836 --> 01:06:05.797
My hope now,
has turned to despair

01:06:06.576 --> 01:06:11.741
My hope now,
has turned to despair

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:19.412
My hope now,
has turned to despair

01:06:23.559 --> 01:06:29.464
Not a single ritual
Did l ever flout

01:06:30.566 --> 01:06:36.436
Like millions around
l submit without a doubt

01:06:36.806 --> 01:06:41.766
God where are You

01:06:43.513 --> 01:06:48.576
Tell me where are You

01:07:16.946 --> 01:07:23.476
You have many names
And many faces too

01:07:23.786 --> 01:07:29.850
l've walked each of the myriad
paths which lead to You

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:36.692
ln no shrine did l find You

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.397
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

01:07:43.906 --> 01:07:49.367
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

01:07:50.847 --> 01:07:56.308
What else should l do
To find you give a clue

01:08:01.324 --> 01:08:06.921
l blindly follow and
With reverence treasure

01:08:07.897 --> 01:08:13.733
Your every whim and fancy
ln more than ample measure

01:08:14.404 --> 01:08:18.807
God where are you

01:08:20.877 --> 01:08:25.404
Tell me where are you

01:08:27.716 --> 01:08:32.848
God where are you

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:40.689
Tell me where are you

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:52.865
God - I'm aII confused

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:59.477
What's my fauIt?
Why can't my voice reach you?

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:03.545
Understand my pIight

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:06.251
Give me some guidance

01:09:06.656 --> 01:09:08.647
PIease

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.484
ShaII I taIk to you
with hands cIasped,

01:09:13.796 --> 01:09:18.790
or on bent knees,
head to the ground?

01:09:21.270 --> 01:09:23.397
Do I wake you
with tempIe beIIs?

01:09:23.738 --> 01:09:25.707
Or caII out on a Ioudspeaker?

01:09:26.742 --> 01:09:32.237
The Geeta, the Quran,
the BibIe - what do I read?

01:09:32.682 --> 01:09:36.675
Your different managers
say different things

01:09:37.353 --> 01:09:41.813
Some insist fast on Monday,
others urge on Tuesday

01:09:42.358 --> 01:09:47.261
Some forbid food after sunset,
some after sunrise

01:09:47.897 --> 01:09:51.832
Some say, worship the cow.
Others say sIaughter her

01:09:52.568 --> 01:09:57.972
Some send me barefoot to the tempIe,
some wearing shoes to the church

01:09:58.474 --> 01:10:01.272
What is right,
what is wrong

01:10:01.577 --> 01:10:03.875
I am cIueIess

01:10:05.581 --> 01:10:08.311
I'm at breaking point

01:10:10.586 --> 01:10:12.713
I want to go home

01:10:13.289 --> 01:10:17.487
I'II do whatever you ask.

01:11:09.445 --> 01:11:10.412
Missing.: God

01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:47.442
Why the Iock man?

01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:49.541

01:11:50.319 --> 01:11:51.445
Open!
It's my entry!

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:53.579
Lord Shiva, sIayer of sins

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:55.423
who fears none

01:11:55.791 --> 01:11:58.316
Security!
Who are you?

01:11:58.394 --> 01:12:00.487
Don't you recognize me?

01:12:00.963 --> 01:12:03.261
I'm Tipsy!

01:12:04.567 --> 01:12:06.865
Where the heII is security?

01:12:07.269 --> 01:12:10.705
Do I perform
for boozards in the toiIet?

01:12:12.408 --> 01:12:14.535
UnIock that door now!

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:16.405
My remote first!

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:19.676
- What remote?
- Of my spaceship

01:12:19.982 --> 01:12:21.279
Space... ship?

01:12:21.484 --> 01:12:24.749
Memory Ioss?
For the ziIIionth time,

01:12:25.321 --> 01:12:27.983
I'm not from here.
I'm from a far off pIanet

01:12:28.324 --> 01:12:29.382
Scooch!

01:12:29.592 --> 01:12:33.494
Gimme my remote,
and I go home. Got it?

01:12:33.929 --> 01:12:37.296
Brother Iet me go.
I've IittIe kids at home

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:39.733
I know!
You fathered two Gods

01:12:39.802 --> 01:12:42.566
Both are centuries oId.
They can be home aIone

01:12:42.638 --> 01:12:45.368
First my remote,
then your famiIy reunion

01:12:46.308 --> 01:12:47.775
Oh God, save me pIease...

01:12:47.877 --> 01:12:49.538
There's a God
above you too?

01:12:49.612 --> 01:12:50.874
Lord Shiva, heIp

01:12:50.980 --> 01:12:52.777
Where?

01:12:54.817 --> 01:12:58.412
Now presenting the dance of Shiva,
the fearIess

01:12:58.487 --> 01:12:59.579
HeIp!

01:13:00.056 --> 01:13:00.988
HeIp!

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:04.453
HeIp!

01:13:11.267 --> 01:13:13.701
HeIp!

01:13:14.804 --> 01:13:15.793
HeIp!

01:13:32.822 --> 01:13:36.314
Hail Lord Shiva

01:13:54.944 --> 01:13:58.778
Hail Lord Shiva

01:13:59.448 --> 01:14:04.943
I was meditating on the
snowy peaks of the HimaIayas

01:14:05.421 --> 01:14:08.584
when, suddenIy - Iight!

01:14:08.891 --> 01:14:11.257
DazzIing Iight!

01:14:11.861 --> 01:14:17.299
It came from a bead
Iying in the snow

01:14:17.967 --> 01:14:22.529
I shut my eyes
and invoked God

01:14:22.605 --> 01:14:25.665
Next moment,
I was connected

01:14:25.741 --> 01:14:28.574
I said,
''God, enIighten me,''

01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:31.280
What is this
miracuIous object,

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.443
that is warm
even in this biting coId?

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:36.282
God said,

01:14:36.318 --> 01:14:41.017
it's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's neckIace

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:47.024
Take it and enshrine it
in a grand tempIe

01:14:47.363 --> 01:14:53.734
Sighting this bead
wiII heaI aII suffering

01:14:53.803 --> 01:14:56.636
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:14:57.439 --> 01:14:59.805
Are you ready
for the sighting?

01:15:00.309 --> 01:15:02.971
The divine bead from
Lord Shiva's neckIace!

01:15:06.782 --> 01:15:11.378
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:15:11.887 --> 01:15:15.983

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:27.528
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:15:27.837 --> 01:15:29.702
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:15:29.905 --> 01:15:30.803
Stop.

01:15:30.873 --> 01:15:35.276
Let him through.
He's awed by the sight

01:15:35.311 --> 01:15:37.302
Come.
- HaiI Lord Shiva

01:15:37.379 --> 01:15:40.507
Not there chiId.
Come here

01:15:40.783 --> 01:15:42.614
Express your ecstasy

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:44.981
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:15:45.387 --> 01:15:48.788

01:15:51.627 --> 01:15:53.857
I want to thank you

01:15:55.297 --> 01:15:56.696
He's right here

01:15:57.032 --> 01:15:58.795
I met Him in the toiIet

01:15:58.868 --> 01:16:01.496
I asked for my property
and He boIted

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:03.635
I thought He vamoosed

01:16:03.906 --> 01:16:07.569
But no!
He Ied me to my property

01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.335
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.339
This isn't Lord Shiva's bead

01:16:13.515 --> 01:16:16.450
It's my property,
misdeIivered to you

01:16:16.518 --> 01:16:18.509
Your bead must be
misdeIivered too

01:16:18.754 --> 01:16:23.555
Ask God, He is right here.
God, do step forward, cIarify

01:16:25.594 --> 01:16:28.529
Anyway,
I'II take my property

01:16:30.532 --> 01:16:33.501
That's mine!
Why're you stopping me?

01:16:35.504 --> 01:16:39.406
HaiI Lord Shiva

01:17:39.301 --> 01:17:44.796
Since when have you feIt

01:17:47.009 --> 01:17:53.312
Listen. You need to see

01:17:54.316 --> 01:17:58.412

That's the story for you

01:18:42.865 --> 01:18:46.562

01:18:47.369 --> 01:18:50.532

01:19:00.015 --> 01:19:01.642
You didn't

01:19:01.917 --> 01:19:03.817
So how do you know?

01:19:04.286 --> 01:19:08.950

01:19:45.294 --> 01:19:48.422
Courier can't reach my home.
PIease keep it

01:19:48.597 --> 01:19:50.326
Thank you

01:19:51.266 --> 01:19:52.358
Sir...

01:19:52.868 --> 01:19:55.894
Here's another Rs 100.
For the tip

01:19:58.273 --> 01:20:00.298
BIess you

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:05.312
Confirmed.
You are no mind reader

01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:10.610
You got conned.
There is no hospitaI around here

01:20:10.819 --> 01:20:12.286
I know!

01:20:12.387 --> 01:20:15.288
He's gifting his wife
a five star dinner

01:20:15.324 --> 01:20:17.451
It's her 75th birthday

01:20:17.526 --> 01:20:20.359
She'd never been
to a fancy pIace

01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:23.396
He's been saving from
his pension for months

01:20:23.499 --> 01:20:26.832
She ordered ice-cream
and his budget went kaput

01:20:26.935 --> 01:20:29.870
With a restroom excuse,
he ran out for some bucks

01:20:29.905 --> 01:20:31.463
Another yarn!

01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:35.738
On our pIanet, we don't Iie

01:20:36.678 --> 01:20:38.475
Anyway, it's up to you

01:21:38.907 --> 01:21:40.499
- Here.
- Thank you Sir

01:21:40.576 --> 01:21:43.306
One moment. Tip him

01:21:43.478 --> 01:21:47.881
Why hoId back -
it's your birthday!

01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:49.312
Thank you

01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.305
Address.: Step-well ruins

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.905
I toId you.
On my pIanet, we don't Iie

01:22:49.945 --> 01:22:52.345
Hope you haven't toId anyone...

01:22:59.354 --> 01:23:01.322
.. that you're an aIien?

01:23:01.523 --> 01:23:02.683
No way!

01:23:02.858 --> 01:23:07.625
They'd Iock me in a Iab,
and rip me up for research!

01:23:09.564 --> 01:23:12.397
How come you toId me?

01:23:13.869 --> 01:23:15.564
Ever since
I set foot on this pIanet

01:23:15.771 --> 01:23:18.763
everyone has taken
money from me

01:23:18.974 --> 01:23:22.466
You were the first to give it up
for me - dumping Rs 5,000 in a box

01:23:22.978 --> 01:23:26.641
I thought you are a good egg.
I couId trust you

01:23:30.018 --> 01:23:32.543
I'II get your remote back, Tipsy

01:23:33.755 --> 01:23:35.313
How?

01:23:35.624 --> 01:23:39.720
I haven't figured it out yet,
but you'II go back home

01:23:40.028 --> 01:23:42.462
That's my promise

01:24:29.789 --> 01:24:31.848
What are you goggIing at?

01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:33.315
You

01:24:34.327 --> 01:24:36.727
AIiens don't drop by everyday

01:24:37.964 --> 01:24:42.094
Everyone on your pIanet
has stick-out ears?

01:24:44.303 --> 01:24:45.827
Yup, ditto

01:24:45.905 --> 01:24:50.933
And they roam around naked?
Isn't it weird?

01:24:51.477 --> 01:24:55.174
That crow is naked -
does he Iook weird?

01:24:55.414 --> 01:24:58.781
If he dons a tie,
he'd Iook weird

01:25:00.820 --> 01:25:03.789
Tipsy, I was awake aII night...

01:25:04.690 --> 01:25:07.784
.. thinking how to get
your remote back

01:25:08.694 --> 01:25:09.319
HeIIo

01:25:09.695 --> 01:25:12.289
Connect to BaIbir Singh.
Room No. 4

01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:14.025
Wrong number

01:25:14.433 --> 01:25:16.128
Isn't this Fortis HospitaI?

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:19.303
Since yesterday you've been
diaIing this wrong number

01:25:19.338 --> 01:25:23.399
ImpossibIe!
I can't be wrong every time!

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.144
So how do we get
the remote?

01:25:30.349 --> 01:25:33.182
Connect to BaIbir Singh.
Room No. 4

01:25:33.252 --> 01:25:36.244
Sorry, Sir.
You've caIIed too Iate

01:25:36.722 --> 01:25:38.383
BaIbir died this morning

01:25:38.925 --> 01:25:43.021
Huh! How can a
piIes surgery be fataI?

01:25:43.296 --> 01:25:45.821
Embarrassing,
but don't worry

01:25:46.065 --> 01:25:48.192
Death Certificate
wiII say heart attack

01:25:48.401 --> 01:25:50.369
so the famiIy saves face

01:25:50.803 --> 01:25:52.896
- Come for the body.
- On my way

01:25:53.206 --> 01:25:55.037
Ok, bye

01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:59.343
Why did you say that?

01:25:59.745 --> 01:26:01.076
DoIing out joy

01:26:01.247 --> 01:26:05.206
When he finds his friend aIive,
imagine his joy!

01:26:05.284 --> 01:26:06.216
What!

01:26:06.352 --> 01:26:10.686
I was sick of his caIIs.
So I pIayed a prank

01:26:11.157 --> 01:26:14.354
- A prank?
- Tipsy, I was just kidding!

01:26:21.300 --> 01:26:22.858
I got it!

01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:27.101
Someone is pIaying pranks

01:26:27.406 --> 01:26:29.966
When His HoIiness diaIs God,

01:26:30.243 --> 01:26:33.406
cocking his head,
'God, enIighten me',

01:26:33.813 --> 01:26:35.940
his caIIs are going
to a Wrong Number

01:26:36.315 --> 01:26:39.216
Someone out there
pIays pranks

01:26:39.418 --> 01:26:43.445
The reaI God won't caII
my remote a bead

01:26:44.891 --> 01:26:51.729
Looks Iike the phone Iines
to God have gone kaput

01:26:51.964 --> 01:26:54.296
AII caIIs to God are going
to a Wrong Number!

01:26:54.734 --> 01:26:56.031
As in?

01:26:56.102 --> 01:27:00.436
Think - wouId the reaI God
give such weird soIutions?

01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:04.875
Like - come roIIing to me,
then I'II heIp you!

01:27:05.177 --> 01:27:07.668
Aren't we God's chiIdren?

01:27:07.847 --> 01:27:13.012
WouId a father make his kids
roII for heIp?

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:18.680
Your Dad ever said - kiddo,
want a new dress? Start roIIing!

01:27:19.358 --> 01:27:23.886
Another prank - bathe me
with cow's miIk! What buII!

01:27:24.363 --> 01:27:30.393
And if these caIIs went to
the reaI God, what wouId He say?

01:27:30.803 --> 01:27:35.399
He'd say - miIIions of my chiIdren
are starving on streets

01:27:35.808 --> 01:27:38.834
Give them miIk.
Don't give me a Iactose shower

01:27:39.278 --> 01:27:42.941
I'm sure someone's pIaying
pranks, Iike you just did

01:27:43.382 --> 01:27:46.215
Tipsy thought His Holiness
was a victim of pranks

01:27:46.452 --> 01:27:48.420
l didn't clear his confusion

01:27:48.921 --> 01:27:51.719
for a crazy idea was
forming in my head

01:27:51.924 --> 01:27:55.792
An idea that would
get back Tipsy's remote

01:27:56.829 --> 01:27:57.921
Who's this Tipsy?

01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:00.331
That's a mystery

01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:03.429
But the way he sees
this worId is unique

01:28:03.836 --> 01:28:06.999
- As in?
- If he saw you smoking,

01:28:07.273 --> 01:28:09.833
he'd caII the cops to say
you're attempting suicide

01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:10.803
Why?

01:28:10.876 --> 01:28:13.936
The pack says 'Smoking KiIIs'
yet you puff away

01:28:15.314 --> 01:28:17.282
So what's the big idea?

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:20.347
Face-off

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:23.687
Between
Tipsy and His HoIiness.

01:28:24.023 --> 01:28:26.787
We'II take
the face-off to TV

01:28:27.259 --> 01:28:29.727
Ratings wiII go
through the roof!

01:28:30.363 --> 01:28:33.196
I have three trident marks
on my right bum

01:28:33.733 --> 01:28:36.258
You want three more on my
Ieft for baIance?

01:28:36.736 --> 01:28:37.703
Don't worry

01:28:37.803 --> 01:28:42.831
Tipsy won't fight His HoIiness
but gentIy expIain, that...

01:28:43.175 --> 01:28:46.201
.. his caIIs to God are going to
a Wrong Number

01:28:46.779 --> 01:28:49.748
His HoIiness wiII be stumped

01:28:50.249 --> 01:28:51.045
Cherry!

01:28:51.384 --> 01:28:54.911
Tipsy's here.
Just meet him once

01:28:55.254 --> 01:28:57.779
I bet his queries
wiII baffIe you

01:28:58.057 --> 01:28:59.752
Trust me. PIease!

01:29:10.236 --> 01:29:12.136
Excuse me,
you dropped this

01:29:12.204 --> 01:29:13.694
Oh, thank you

01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:19.270
That's not mine

01:29:20.846 --> 01:29:23.679
Kamasutra condoms,
strawberry fIavor

01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:27.942
I hate strawberries, man.
Ask these guys

01:29:28.287 --> 01:29:30.778
It's not mine.
Buzzed bozo!

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:35.153
- Ma'am, yours?
- How dare you!

01:29:35.361 --> 01:29:39.730
- Check your purse if it's missing.
- ShameIess cad!

01:29:40.699 --> 01:29:43.395
- Has to be yours.
- No, not mine

01:29:43.836 --> 01:29:45.394
Tipsy, it's his

01:29:45.805 --> 01:29:50.208
Ask him aII you want
to know about it. Come on in

01:29:54.713 --> 01:29:55.805
What's this?

01:29:56.882 --> 01:29:58.372
It's a condom

01:29:58.784 --> 01:30:03.448
- What does it do?
- ControIs the worId's popuIation

01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:05.079
How?

01:30:05.658 --> 01:30:09.924
It has to be worn
whiIe having sex

01:30:12.231 --> 01:30:15.359
How does your wearing it
controI the worId's popuIation?

01:30:15.668 --> 01:30:18.831
Not just me...
miIIions wear it

01:30:19.038 --> 01:30:21.006
They aII borrow it from you?

01:30:21.207 --> 01:30:23.072
No. Everyone has it

01:30:23.375 --> 01:30:27.243
- I've a question
- Go on Tipsy, shoot

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.844
If money is dropped,
aII run for it

01:30:31.951 --> 01:30:37.218
If a condom is dropped,
aII run away from it. Why?

01:30:37.790 --> 01:30:40.122
Sex is a very private matter

01:30:40.259 --> 01:30:41.726
Why?

01:30:41.861 --> 01:30:45.228
You don't teII the whoIe town -
I'm having sex today

01:30:45.731 --> 01:30:50.725
But, then at weddings,
with fireworks and music bands

01:30:50.769 --> 01:30:55.729
why do they teII the whoIe town -
I'm having sex today?

01:30:57.843 --> 01:30:59.174
What's the matter?

01:30:59.945 --> 01:31:04.905
I have no answer for you
but I have a job for you

01:31:05.851 --> 01:31:07.318
Thank you!

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:11.915
Let's beat it before
he changes his mind

01:31:13.859 --> 01:31:16.293
ShieId your hoIy bum,
Your HoIiness

01:31:16.662 --> 01:31:18.653
My trident is on its way

01:31:22.401 --> 01:31:25.962
At this pIace His HoIiness
connects his devotees to God

01:31:26.105 --> 01:31:27.936
for soIutions to their woes

01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:31.141
Listen carefuIIy to his caIIs

01:31:31.243 --> 01:31:37.705
If you think the caIIs are going
to a Wrong Number, aIert him

01:31:38.050 --> 01:31:41.679
- WiII that get me my remote?
- Once he reaIises...

01:31:41.754 --> 01:31:46.282
.. the bead story is a prank
he'II return your remote

01:31:46.358 --> 01:31:49.418
Good pIan. Let's go

01:31:50.896 --> 01:31:53.956
To buiId a home for someone
is a hoIy deed

01:31:54.033 --> 01:31:58.697
To buiId a home for God
is the hoIiest deed

01:31:59.104 --> 01:32:01.800
So donate for the tempIe

01:32:02.007 --> 01:32:04.805
And see
your woes fIee

01:32:05.644 --> 01:32:09.102
Son, voice your woe

01:32:10.082 --> 01:32:11.379
Your HoIiness,

01:32:12.117 --> 01:32:14.711
my wife's been paraIyzed
for six months

01:32:14.987 --> 01:32:18.718
The doctors have given up.
What shaII I...

01:32:20.192 --> 01:32:21.819
God

01:32:22.661 --> 01:32:23.923
EnIighten me

01:32:31.003 --> 01:32:32.334
Yes...

01:32:35.774 --> 01:32:37.935
What pIace?

01:32:42.781 --> 01:32:44.749
What transport?

01:32:47.286 --> 01:32:49.720
Your wish is our command

01:32:52.358 --> 01:32:54.986
Have you heard of
the Rathong gIacier?

01:32:55.060 --> 01:32:56.254
No

01:32:56.762 --> 01:33:01.165
It's in the HimaIayas.
Take a train to SiIIiguri

01:33:02.001 --> 01:33:04.765
then a bus to Gangtok

01:33:05.638 --> 01:33:10.075
then an eight day trek

01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:15.203
You'II reach a grand tempIe

01:33:16.148 --> 01:33:19.311
Pray there,
your probIem wiII be soIved

01:33:19.652 --> 01:33:21.950
Wrong Number!
This is a Wrong Number!

01:33:22.254 --> 01:33:24.119
- What?
- Wrong Number

01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:29.828
Your HoIiness, your phone Iine
to God has gone kaput

01:33:30.663 --> 01:33:32.722
Your caIIs are going to
a Wrong Number

01:33:32.931 --> 01:33:36.765
and a fake God is
pIaying pranks

01:33:36.902 --> 01:33:40.099
What are you trying to say?

01:33:40.372 --> 01:33:43.273
I'II expIain.
Aren't we God's chiIdren?

01:33:43.976 --> 01:33:44.943
Yes, so?

01:33:45.144 --> 01:33:48.875
Say your kid's in a jam
and comes to you

01:33:49.214 --> 01:33:51.944
WiII you heIp promptIy,
or wiII you say

01:33:52.084 --> 01:33:55.349
kiddo, I've another house
2,000 miIes away

01:33:55.688 --> 01:33:58.714
Come there, teII me
the same probIem again

01:33:58.924 --> 01:34:01.290
Then I'II soIve it.
What buII!

01:34:01.727 --> 01:34:06.926
If the caII went to reaI God, He'd
say: Son, tend to your aiIing wife,

01:34:07.266 --> 01:34:09.734
don't run after me

01:34:09.935 --> 01:34:12.927
after death
you'II come to me anyway

01:34:13.072 --> 01:34:16.769
give her your time now. Right?

01:34:20.979 --> 01:34:23.413
I can prove it's a prank

01:34:23.749 --> 01:34:26.980
CaII this fake God
again and ask

01:34:27.252 --> 01:34:29.846
What's the guarantee
she wiII get weII

01:34:30.055 --> 01:34:34.116
Sir, tiII you get it in writing,
don't Ieave her side

01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:37.262
Just caII,
and cIear aII doubt

01:34:38.230 --> 01:34:41.461
It's time for His HoIiness'
hoIy siIence

01:34:43.235 --> 01:34:52.337
Praise be to God
Glory be to God

01:34:55.047 --> 01:35:00.007
This fake God is passing off
my property as a hoIy bead

01:35:00.319 --> 01:35:03.254
He's pIaying a prank

01:35:04.757 --> 01:35:07.282
He is no God.
He is a fraud

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:09.951
He is a FRAUD

01:35:10.162 --> 01:35:13.825
God doesn't taIk
to us mortaIs

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:18.097
He communicates
through His managers

01:35:18.704 --> 01:35:22.037
- Tipsy has raised a big question.
- What?

01:35:23.442 --> 01:35:26.809
Is God reaIIy taIking
to the managers?

01:35:26.879 --> 01:35:27.777
No

01:35:27.846 --> 01:35:32.044
So where do the commands
for us come from?

01:35:32.351 --> 01:35:36.014
- From a Wrong Number!
- So what shouId the pubIic do?

01:35:36.221 --> 01:35:40.021
TiII phone Iines are fixed,
don't depend on God's managers

01:35:40.092 --> 01:35:42.788
HeIp each other
in difficuIt times

01:35:43.095 --> 01:35:50.160
A great tip from Tipsy:
Don't reIy on God's managers

01:35:50.369 --> 01:35:53.361
ReIy on each other

01:35:55.474 --> 01:35:59.308
Hail Lord Shiva

01:36:00.746 --> 01:36:05.115
Tipsy says don't make the tempIe,
the bead beIongs to him

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:07.309
What's in your pocket?

01:36:09.855 --> 01:36:12.688
- Do you smoke?
- Yes

01:36:12.858 --> 01:36:16.988
- You consume aIcohoI?
- OccasionaIIy

01:36:17.196 --> 01:36:20.393
You smoke cigarettes,
consume aIcohoI

01:36:20.432 --> 01:36:24.129
despite knowing
their fataI effects

01:36:25.003 --> 01:36:27.198
Governments
permit these poisons,

01:36:27.739 --> 01:36:32.904
factories manufacture them,
stores seII them

01:36:33.011 --> 01:36:35.172
Nobody questions this

01:36:35.414 --> 01:36:43.014
But in this sacred Iand of
Lord Ram and Krishna

01:36:43.121 --> 01:36:45.851
if I wish to buiId a tempIe

01:36:46.725 --> 01:36:48.420
why these questions?

01:36:49.261 --> 01:36:56.758
Why not question the man
who is trying to staII this tempIe?

01:36:57.002 --> 01:36:58.731
Who's this Tipsy?

01:36:59.104 --> 01:37:01.163
What's his reaI name?

01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:06.673
Why's he hiding it?
Is he a MusIim?

01:37:07.279 --> 01:37:11.682
If question you must,
go ask Tipsy

01:37:11.717 --> 01:37:13.309
what is his reIigion?

01:37:13.752 --> 01:37:17.984
Find out his reIigion,
Find out his faith

01:37:20.893 --> 01:37:23.862
Centuries ago,
Mohammad of Ghazni

01:37:24.730 --> 01:37:26.755
came and destroyed
our tempIes

01:37:27.232 --> 01:37:31.828
Today another invader
wants to repeat history

01:37:32.004 --> 01:37:33.164
But we won't aIIow...

01:38:00.098 --> 01:38:04.660
Your God asks my reIigion.
Let's ask Him...

01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:07.102
.. the reIigions of these peopIe

01:38:07.205 --> 01:38:11.665
- What nonsense?
- CaII up your God!

01:38:11.710 --> 01:38:16.147
Why bother God?
I'II teII you

01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:18.281
This one is a Hindu.
He's a Christian...

01:38:18.717 --> 01:38:20.309
.. Sikh, Jain and...

01:38:20.719 --> 01:38:23.347
.. that one is of your reIigion

01:38:25.123 --> 01:38:27.819
EnIighten him

01:38:28.226 --> 01:38:31.718
HeIIo. I'm Sikh

01:38:31.964 --> 01:38:35.229
Greetings.
I'm MusIim

01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:37.726
I'm Jain

01:38:37.803 --> 01:38:40.169
Hi,
I'm Christian

01:38:40.806 --> 01:38:44.037
HeIIo! I'm Hindu

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:46.007
BamboozIed!

01:38:46.311 --> 01:38:50.008
I swapped their robes.
Get it?

01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:52.206
Faith is connected
to fashion

01:38:52.284 --> 01:38:55.378
Want a demo?
Check the math

01:38:56.054 --> 01:38:58.784
Beard + moustache + turban = Sikh

01:38:59.191 --> 01:39:01.887
Minus turban = Hindu

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:05.223
Minus moustache = MusIim!

01:39:05.964 --> 01:39:08.956
This difference is
made by the fake God

01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:11.702
If reaI God wanted it,
He'd put a IabeI on us

01:39:11.770 --> 01:39:14.762
- Is there a IabeI on your body?
- Mine?

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:17.934
Don't gape, strip and check!

01:39:18.243 --> 01:39:20.177
Why be coy?

01:39:20.779 --> 01:39:25.682
Strip everyone, show His HoIiness.
Is there any IabeI?

01:39:25.984 --> 01:39:29.886
Cut the coyness.
OK, I'II go first

01:39:32.257 --> 01:39:34.885
See the bare facts

01:39:36.028 --> 01:39:40.931
Is there a IabeI?

01:39:41.767 --> 01:39:43.234
Nothing! You see!

01:39:43.435 --> 01:39:45.130
Check some more...

01:39:45.737 --> 01:39:47.830
Remove this ruffian

01:39:48.206 --> 01:39:51.300
Hey!
I'm proving a point

01:39:51.410 --> 01:39:53.401
Start the chants!

01:39:53.779 --> 01:39:56.270
Praise be to God
Glory be to God

01:39:56.415 --> 01:40:00.317
That's no divine bead

01:40:08.226 --> 01:40:09.284
Jaggu!

01:40:10.395 --> 01:40:11.885
Stop this farce!

01:40:12.264 --> 01:40:13.253
Papa!

01:40:15.701 --> 01:40:19.797
You were aII of 40 days, when
His HoIiness christened you

01:40:19.938 --> 01:40:23.738
Remember, he who gives you
a name, can ruin it too

01:40:24.309 --> 01:40:26.675
He named me
Jagat Janani

01:40:26.912 --> 01:40:28.345
How can he ruin it further?

01:40:28.747 --> 01:40:31.739
You!
Name your price

01:40:31.983 --> 01:40:32.677
Papa!

01:40:32.851 --> 01:40:35.718
Trying to scare His HoIiness
to extort money

01:40:35.887 --> 01:40:36.353
No, no

01:40:36.788 --> 01:40:41.691
You'II burn in HeII!
Fear the wrath of God!

01:40:46.765 --> 01:40:49.290
Thank you Papa!
Thank you

01:40:50.135 --> 01:40:53.764
I'd soIved onIy haIf the puzzIe.
You pieced it together

01:40:53.972 --> 01:40:55.701
Fear is the key

01:40:55.907 --> 01:41:01.209
The prankster is
cashing in on fear. Get it?

01:41:01.813 --> 01:41:04.179
Not exactIy,
but can you expIain to Papa?

01:41:04.282 --> 01:41:08.241
You bet! I can prove it.
FoIIow me

01:41:09.654 --> 01:41:11.679
I don't have time
for this nonsense

01:41:11.957 --> 01:41:15.950
If it turns out to be nonsense,
I'II caII off the show

01:41:28.807 --> 01:41:33.107
Exams are on at this coIIege.
The students are scared stiff

01:41:33.345 --> 01:41:38.282
Now, we'II estabIish our business -
The Fear Factory

01:41:49.427 --> 01:41:51.918
Machine instaIIed

01:41:56.968 --> 01:41:59.835
A IittIe seed capitaI

01:42:03.708 --> 01:42:07.166
Now the inauguration

01:42:16.288 --> 01:42:21.191
Just watch!
CapitaI doubIes in 15 minutes

01:42:27.132 --> 01:42:28.690
Look there

01:42:30.769 --> 01:42:32.293
The first customer!

01:42:33.004 --> 01:42:36.269
Tea... piping hot tea

01:42:36.775 --> 01:42:39.039
Check the investment
of the tea vendor

01:42:39.344 --> 01:42:42.780
KettIe, tea, sugar, bike,
thermos

01:42:43.114 --> 01:42:46.777
And here -
a rock and a red mark

01:42:46.985 --> 01:42:48.782
Hot and piping tea...

01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:51.115
There, you gotta
woo the cIients

01:42:51.356 --> 01:42:54.223
Here you shoo them away

01:42:54.359 --> 01:42:58.728
Hey, scram.
Give others a chance

01:43:01.233 --> 01:43:03.701
There you bow
before the customer

01:43:03.802 --> 01:43:06.066
Here the customer
bows before you

01:43:08.673 --> 01:43:12.734
If he's in deep troubIe,
he goes horizontaI

01:43:13.812 --> 01:43:18.181
The Wrong Number guy
trades in fear

01:43:18.650 --> 01:43:21.676
He knows - those in dread
to the tempIe head

01:43:22.287 --> 01:43:25.222
You too seem afraid!
Off with these...

01:43:26.658 --> 01:43:29.092
Do not question reIigion

01:43:29.761 --> 01:43:31.888
It's a matter of faith!

01:43:32.097 --> 01:43:34.793
If God didn't want us
to raise questions

01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.927
He wouIdn't give us
the power to reason

01:43:39.304 --> 01:43:43.138
Guardians of reIigion use vioIence
when they can't answer us

01:43:43.308 --> 01:43:47.267
They scare us into siIence.
But now we won't be siIent

01:43:47.712 --> 01:43:52.274
So far one Tipsy raised questions.
Now there'II be a thousand

01:43:52.751 --> 01:43:55.219
Friends, pick up your phones

01:43:55.687 --> 01:44:00.420
When you spot a Wrong Number,
shoot it and send it to us

01:44:00.959 --> 01:44:03.154
We'II put it on TV

01:44:03.695 --> 01:44:06.220
Dump your fear,
ask questions

01:44:15.307 --> 01:44:17.241
HoIy Sir!

01:44:17.742 --> 01:44:18.970
One question

01:44:19.044 --> 01:44:21.342
If you can conjure goId
from thin air

01:44:21.746 --> 01:44:24.374
why don't you end
the nation's poverty?

01:44:24.783 --> 01:44:26.717
Answer pIease

01:44:27.319 --> 01:44:28.308
HoIy Sir!

01:44:28.386 --> 01:44:33.255
Since you're a waIking goId mine,
why ask us for donations?

01:44:35.794 --> 01:44:38.092
God is great!

01:44:38.330 --> 01:44:40.730
This is a Wrong Number

01:44:40.865 --> 01:44:44.301
- Jaggu... come with me
- Cherry give me a moment

01:44:44.736 --> 01:44:48.433
Come with me

01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:50.469
The Wrong Number idea
is a nationaI rage

01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:54.375
- What!
- It's spread Iike wiId fire

01:44:59.918 --> 01:45:02.751
Guru says - to Iand a job,
feed a cow

01:45:02.954 --> 01:45:06.321
Is this cow
an empIoyment agent?

01:45:06.691 --> 01:45:10.286
Or posts CVs on Monster.com?
Wrong Number

01:45:10.395 --> 01:45:11.692
Watch this one!

01:45:11.997 --> 01:45:14.795
He says, convert to
Christianity, or be damned

01:45:15.133 --> 01:45:18.830
If God wanted,
I'd be Christian by birth

01:45:19.204 --> 01:45:22.401
Why convert now?
Wrong Number

01:45:22.941 --> 01:45:24.806
These girIs want to
go to schooI

01:45:25.076 --> 01:45:28.170
A new dictat says:
kiII them if they do

01:45:28.346 --> 01:45:33.010
Is God so smaII,
He'II deny chiIdren knowIedge?

01:45:33.718 --> 01:45:35.208
Wrong Number

01:45:35.854 --> 01:45:39.187
What God has destined for you
wiII happen

01:45:39.724 --> 01:45:43.785
He has a master pIan
for the Universe

01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:45.958
Accept it

01:45:46.164 --> 01:45:50.760
Your discipIes say:
to get a maIe chiId,

01:45:50.902 --> 01:45:55.305
buy this book,
and chant the mantras

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:59.176
So buy a Rs 10 book

01:45:59.244 --> 01:46:03.078
and bust
God's master pIan!

01:46:11.289 --> 01:46:15.419
Tipsy! Your show's a hit!
Messages are pouring in

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:17.352
Here's one more

01:46:22.333 --> 01:46:23.698
What happened?

01:46:24.402 --> 01:46:28.361
It's Papa. He's ashamed
I'm his daughter

01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:34.906
I was in tenth grade

01:46:36.114 --> 01:46:38.810
when I wrote my first poem

01:46:39.384 --> 01:46:41.443
For Papa

01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:47.915
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible,

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:51.888
but l'm my Daddy's girl

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:54.722
I recited it
on the AnnuaI Day

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.225
AII parents cIapped

01:46:57.735 --> 01:47:01.728
but one whistIed with joy

01:47:02.874 --> 01:47:06.867
The appIause ended,
the whistIing continued

01:47:07.846 --> 01:47:09.313
It was Papa

01:47:09.881 --> 01:47:11.906
He was so proud of me

01:47:13.284 --> 01:47:17.846
And now this message.
Ashamed of you

01:47:18.389 --> 01:47:23.725
There's a Wrong Number
in your Papa's head

01:47:24.329 --> 01:47:29.961
The day he gets rid of it,
he'II whistIe for you again

01:47:30.335 --> 01:47:32.064
It won't happen

01:47:32.737 --> 01:47:35.706
Don't be sad. Come with me

01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:39.938
On my pIanet when peopIe are sad,
know what they do?

01:47:40.311 --> 01:47:41.801
What?

01:47:42.046 --> 01:47:44.810
Recharge the battery!

01:47:45.049 --> 01:47:47.847
- What!
- Just copy me

01:47:52.991 --> 01:47:54.720
What are we doing?

01:48:00.732 --> 01:48:02.324
Shut your eyes!

01:48:02.433 --> 01:48:04.162
How do I copy then?

01:48:04.235 --> 01:48:06.135
Right.
Keep them open

01:49:40.365 --> 01:49:43.357
To steal glances at you all day

01:49:43.768 --> 01:49:46.396
To strain for every word you say

01:49:46.871 --> 01:49:49.806
To put every chore aside

01:49:50.074 --> 01:49:53.043
And follow your every stride

01:49:53.211 --> 01:49:55.873
That's nothing but a
waste of time

01:49:56.314 --> 01:49:59.147
Love is a waste of time

01:49:59.717 --> 01:50:02.151
Amore is nothing more

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:05.655
Love is a waste of time

01:50:06.057 --> 01:50:09.049
But my mind and heart insist

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:12.093
Once in this life at least

01:50:12.664 --> 01:50:14.928
l must waste my time

01:50:15.266 --> 01:50:17.996
Without reason or rhyme

01:50:18.403 --> 01:50:21.270
l want to waste my time

01:50:21.706 --> 01:50:24.197
l love this waste of time

01:50:41.326 --> 01:50:45.786
A zillion peeps into the mirror

01:50:47.765 --> 01:50:52.395
A million times
l've styled my hair

01:50:54.205 --> 01:50:59.336
Countless sets of
clothes l've tried

01:51:00.712 --> 01:51:05.115
Emptied perfume
bottles with flair

01:51:06.784 --> 01:51:12.654
Dressing up is all l did
Did nothing else worthwhile

01:51:13.324 --> 01:51:16.157
Now l understand

01:51:16.394 --> 01:51:19.124
That love is waste of time

01:51:19.664 --> 01:51:22.656
But my mind and heart insist

01:51:22.867 --> 01:51:25.859
Once in this life at least

01:51:26.137 --> 01:51:28.697
l must waste my time

01:51:28.873 --> 01:51:31.740
Without reason or rhyme

01:51:32.110 --> 01:51:34.977
l want to waste my time

01:51:35.279 --> 01:51:38.680
l love this waste of time

01:52:14.118 --> 01:52:18.782
My world has
topsy-turvy turned

01:52:20.825 --> 01:52:25.762
l know not how to tell you

01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:32.125
l smile without rhyme
or reason

01:52:33.337 --> 01:52:38.001
What's happening
l have no clue

01:52:39.844 --> 01:52:45.680
The mind just wants to soar
And from rooftops yell

01:52:46.184 --> 01:52:52.282
Now l understand
Love is a waste of time

01:52:52.690 --> 01:52:55.784
But my mind and heart insist

01:52:55.927 --> 01:52:58.828
Once in this life at least

01:52:59.063 --> 01:53:01.224
l must waste my time

01:53:02.133 --> 01:53:04.727
Without reason or rhyme

01:53:04.902 --> 01:53:07.962
l want to waste my time

01:53:08.206 --> 01:53:11.698
l love this waste of time

01:53:51.249 --> 01:53:54.412
The donation box is getting
more questions than cash

01:53:54.852 --> 01:53:59.755
Your reIics don't seII anymore

01:54:00.157 --> 01:54:04.253
MiIIions of abuses on
Facebook and Twitter

01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:09.095
- Just five?
- Those are in support

01:54:09.433 --> 01:54:11.401
The abuses are in here

01:54:12.103 --> 01:54:18.269
It's time for action, Sir.
Avoiding the issue can be disastrous

01:54:22.947 --> 01:54:24.437
Missing.: God

01:54:24.849 --> 01:54:26.248
CaII Cherry Bajwa

01:54:26.951 --> 01:54:30.819
Tipsy has asked many questions.
I'II ask him just one

01:54:30.988 --> 01:54:33.923
- Hey Jaggu
- What happened?

01:54:34.892 --> 01:54:38.293
His HoIiness wants to come
on the show. To debate with Tipsy

01:54:38.429 --> 01:54:41.193
- Tipsy'II rip him!
- It'II be a mother of a show!

01:54:41.432 --> 01:54:44.890
Get Tipsy ready.
Put the promos out

01:54:45.169 --> 01:54:48.969
'The Final Question'
Sunday 6:00 pm

01:54:50.875 --> 01:54:55.335
Don't miss, 'The Final Question'
Sunday 6:00 pm

01:54:55.446 --> 01:55:00.281
My paI's become a star!
Hey Iook, he's a rock star

01:55:00.418 --> 01:55:04.184
Rock star was
roaming butt naked

01:55:04.388 --> 01:55:09.690
I made him a star.
The bIoke's on TV

01:55:10.127 --> 01:55:16.225
and me - in this shanty town,
this crappy shack

01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:21.035
guzzIing booze with
a jackass Iike you

01:55:21.138 --> 01:55:23.299
Star my foot!

01:55:39.357 --> 01:55:41.917
Tipsy, some
Bhairon Singh for you

01:55:42.193 --> 01:55:43.285
Bhairon!

01:55:43.427 --> 01:55:45.258
Take that Iine

01:55:46.731 --> 01:55:49.029
- Bro!
- You Iusty Iad

01:55:49.233 --> 01:55:51.201
You're a rock star!

01:55:51.335 --> 01:55:53.735
Bro, where are you?

01:55:53.838 --> 01:55:56.932
In Mandawa.
Coming to DeIhi tomorrow

01:55:57.174 --> 01:55:59.938
With a gift for you

01:56:00.277 --> 01:56:04.680
I've nabbed the thief
who stoIe your stuff

01:56:04.949 --> 01:56:07.918
He soId it for 40 grand

01:56:08.419 --> 01:56:10.751
- Guess to whom.
- Whom?

01:56:11.222 --> 01:56:14.680
His HoIiness!

01:56:16.861 --> 01:56:23.824
God said.: it's a divine bead
from Lord Shiva's necklace. Take it...

01:56:24.268 --> 01:56:30.070
.. and enshrine it in a grand temple.
Sighting this bead...

01:56:30.241 --> 01:56:31.708
Hey,

01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:35.071
what happened?

01:56:35.446 --> 01:56:39.246
The thief who stoIe
my remote is caught

01:56:39.417 --> 01:56:40.907
What! ReaIIy?

01:56:41.085 --> 01:56:46.421
Bro said, the thief soId it to
His HoIiness

01:56:46.724 --> 01:56:48.419
Then His HoIiness is finished!

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:52.994
We'II teII him -
return the remote,

01:56:53.264 --> 01:56:55.732
or the thief teIIs aII on TV

01:56:56.333 --> 01:57:01.896
So he didn't find my remote
in the HimaIayas! He's Iying

01:57:02.907 --> 01:57:07.003
Wrong Numbers are not
fIoated by some fake God...

01:57:07.411 --> 01:57:09.777
.. but by His HoIiness

01:57:12.116 --> 01:57:14.380
You knew this Jaggu?

01:57:14.685 --> 01:57:16.983
Remember the day
you mentioned Wrong Number

01:57:17.254 --> 01:57:22.214
All his calls are going
to a Wrong Number

01:57:22.426 --> 01:57:27.159
I knew then you were on the
wrong track. But I kept mum

01:57:27.398 --> 01:57:31.164
If you'd caIIed him a fraud,
peopIe wouId have kiIIed you

01:57:31.335 --> 01:57:33.428
PeopIe crave for the unique

01:57:33.771 --> 01:57:35.295
Wrong Number!

01:57:35.706 --> 01:57:38.402
Your Wrong Number
concept was unique

01:57:38.809 --> 01:57:41.277
Today the worId supports you

01:57:41.412 --> 01:57:46.042
Tipsy, my pIan worked!
You're going home!

01:57:50.788 --> 01:57:54.155
You'II fIy away tomorrow,
my friend

01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:57.224
Whoosh... gone

01:57:58.929 --> 01:58:01.796
We'II never meet again

01:58:03.267 --> 01:58:06.327
There wiII be such a void

01:58:07.671 --> 01:58:10.299
I'II reaIIy miss you

01:58:12.076 --> 01:58:14.135
ShaII I stay back?

01:58:17.014 --> 01:58:19.676
How can you?

01:58:20.351 --> 01:58:23.787
SimpIe,
I have a job

01:58:24.255 --> 01:58:27.315
I'II get some ID made
and settIe here

01:58:27.825 --> 01:58:32.023
I'II find someone to
'waste time' with me

01:58:32.696 --> 01:58:35.062
I'II marry her

01:58:35.332 --> 01:58:38.062
- Who'II marry you!
- Why not?

01:58:38.369 --> 01:58:42.897
Your wife wiII go nuts
introducing you -

01:58:43.707 --> 01:58:47.234
Meet my husband.
He's Tipsy!

01:58:48.212 --> 01:58:51.409
That's not my name!

01:58:51.715 --> 01:58:54.309
- Tipsyyy!
- I'II get a reaI name

01:58:55.719 --> 01:59:01.351
Why don't you suggest one?
A name you Iove

01:59:02.126 --> 01:59:07.792
A man's name must
match his personaIity

01:59:07.998 --> 01:59:09.659
Right!

01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:12.291
So how is my personaIity?

01:59:12.736 --> 01:59:14.670
I'II expIain

01:59:15.239 --> 01:59:17.901
A poet once wrote...

01:59:19.677 --> 01:59:22.669
lrony of mismatched names...

01:59:22.847 --> 01:59:26.112
No poetry, pIease!
I've something to say

01:59:26.784 --> 01:59:31.221
Who says
'What's in a name?'

01:59:32.790 --> 01:59:36.419
lf you don't get the right one,
what a pain

01:59:37.428 --> 01:59:41.364
Mr Burns is in fact so cool

01:59:41.832 --> 01:59:44.699
With violence alone
Mr Peace does rule

01:59:46.036 --> 01:59:51.702
His name is Mr Fox
But has no bushy tail

01:59:52.710 --> 01:59:57.272
''l love you Jaggu''

01:59:57.715 --> 02:00:01.708
One whole ton is the
weight of Mr Flower

02:00:02.186 --> 02:00:05.986
At his mere sight,
the poor chair does cower

02:00:06.156 --> 02:00:07.851
Very nice... very nice

02:00:08.092 --> 02:00:11.687
Here's a bunch of cards
with different names

02:00:11.996 --> 02:00:15.363
Pick the one you Iike

02:00:15.699 --> 02:00:18.224
Danduram Thatte?

02:00:18.769 --> 02:00:21.169
- Disaster!
- Next!

02:00:21.939 --> 02:00:23.702
Tutari Singh?

02:00:24.008 --> 02:00:25.771
Phooey!

02:00:26.844 --> 02:00:28.334
Sarfaraz

02:00:32.850 --> 02:00:35.375
- Sarfaraz...
- What happened?

02:00:35.786 --> 02:00:38.448
Keep going,
find a good name

02:00:41.926 --> 02:00:43.416
What's the matter?

02:00:44.128 --> 02:00:45.789
Nothing

02:01:38.215 --> 02:01:40.115
''l love you Jaggu''

02:01:54.231 --> 02:01:55.994
Brother!

02:02:28.665 --> 02:02:32.226
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

02:02:32.703 --> 02:02:35.968
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

02:02:36.673 --> 02:02:40.666
Nowadays He doesn't have
Time to look around

02:02:40.811 --> 02:02:44.804
God is in His Heaven
We mortals on ground

02:02:52.890 --> 02:02:56.326
Whatever may happen here
He does not reprimand

02:02:56.827 --> 02:03:00.820
Thousand evils, million wrongs
He does not take a stand

02:03:01.031 --> 02:03:05.297
Plundering is all around
Bombs come to hound

02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:56.283
A terrorist outfit has claimed
responsibility for the blast

02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:59.848
They say this was
a mock drill

02:04:00.324 --> 02:04:03.020
Persecute our people,
and real war will follow

02:04:03.327 --> 02:04:06.296
We shall protect our God

02:04:27.751 --> 02:04:29.912
Where are you
going, Tipsy?

02:04:30.754 --> 02:04:31.948
On the show

02:04:32.222 --> 02:04:34.247
You don't have to

02:04:36.727 --> 02:04:39.161
I must.
More than ever

02:04:53.777 --> 02:04:59.010
'The Final Question'
WeIcome to our speciaI show

02:04:59.216 --> 02:05:00.774
in which we meet Tipsy...

02:05:00.851 --> 02:05:02.876
Wait a minute

02:05:08.759 --> 02:05:10.693
Bring it

02:05:16.166 --> 02:05:17.963
What is this?

02:05:18.235 --> 02:05:22.899
God says: it's a divine bead
from His neckIace

02:05:23.173 --> 02:05:26.802
This man cIaims,
it's his property

02:05:27.711 --> 02:05:31.044
God says: buiId a tempIe

02:05:31.715 --> 02:05:35.082
And this man opposes it

02:05:35.319 --> 02:05:40.780
Who do I Iisten to?
God, or this gentIeman

02:05:41.158 --> 02:05:46.926
who used to hand out these
bIasphemous pamphIets?

02:05:48.298 --> 02:05:51.324
First he cIaimed,
God is missing

02:05:52.035 --> 02:05:54.003
Then said, God is a fraud

02:05:54.238 --> 02:05:58.004
Next he'II say,
God is dead

02:05:59.409 --> 02:06:04.938
What do you want, son?
A worId without God?

02:06:07.117 --> 02:06:11.713
Do you have any cIue
how peopIe suffer?

02:06:12.055 --> 02:06:14.319
No food to eat

02:06:15.025 --> 02:06:17.016
No pIace to Iive

02:06:17.928 --> 02:06:20.726
No friend to taIk to

02:06:21.198 --> 02:06:27.831
PeopIe kiII themseIves.
SIit their wrists, jump off buiIdings

02:06:28.138 --> 02:06:32.131
Why?
Because they have no hope

02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:37.146
If bowing before God,
smearing hoIy ash,

02:06:37.914 --> 02:06:42.715
wearing amuIets,
gives them hope to Iive,

02:06:42.919 --> 02:06:47.720
then who are you
to snatch away that hope?

02:06:48.191 --> 02:06:56.291
And if you snatch away their God,
how wiII you fiII that void?

02:06:57.234 --> 02:07:01.261
This man rants about
Wrong Numbers

02:07:01.738 --> 02:07:07.404
Today he must teII us:
what is the Right Number?

02:07:15.252 --> 02:07:18.312
You are right, Your HoIiness

02:07:19.089 --> 02:07:24.686
There was a time
I too had no food to eat

02:07:25.329 --> 02:07:27.126
No pIace to Iive

02:07:27.764 --> 02:07:32.827
I cried a Iot
because I had no friend

02:07:34.204 --> 02:07:37.401
I had onIy one hope then -

02:07:39.976 --> 02:07:41.807
God

02:07:42.813 --> 02:07:45.941
Each day I hoped:
tomorrow wiII be better

02:07:46.249 --> 02:07:49.047
God wiII find a soIution

02:07:50.854 --> 02:07:57.453
I agree
beIief in God gives hope,

02:07:58.895 --> 02:08:03.025
the strength to face ordeaIs

02:08:04.167 --> 02:08:06.727
But I have one question

02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:12.675
Which God shaII I beIieve in?

02:08:13.677 --> 02:08:16.908
You say there is ONE God

02:08:17.848 --> 02:08:19.816
I say no

02:08:20.817 --> 02:08:22.284
There are TWO Gods

02:08:23.854 --> 02:08:25.981
One who created us

02:08:27.758 --> 02:08:31.387
And the other
whom you created

02:08:32.329 --> 02:08:35.730
We know nothing about
the God who made us

02:08:36.099 --> 02:08:40.866
But the God YOU made up,
is just Iike you

02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:45.767
Petty.
Takes bribes, makes faIse promises

02:08:45.876 --> 02:08:49.903
ReadiIy meets the rich,
keeps the poor waiting

02:08:50.247 --> 02:08:53.705
Thrives on fIattery.
Makes you Iive in fear

02:08:55.752 --> 02:08:57.982
My Right Number is simpIe

02:08:59.423 --> 02:09:04.122
The God who created us aII,
beIieve in Him

02:09:05.695 --> 02:09:08.994
The God YOU created -

02:09:09.933 --> 02:09:12.128
aboIish him

02:09:12.402 --> 02:09:13.869
Yes!

02:09:14.271 --> 02:09:18.264
You'II aboIish my God
and I'II keep quiet?

02:09:18.742 --> 02:09:22.769
I know how to
protect my God

02:09:22.946 --> 02:09:24.846
You wiII protect God?

02:09:25.415 --> 02:09:27.315
You!

02:09:27.717 --> 02:09:29.275
This is a puny pIanet

02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:32.921
BiIIions of bigger pIanets
fIoat in space

02:09:33.123 --> 02:09:37.958
And you, sitting in a tiny corner of this
puny pIanet, have the nerve to say

02:09:38.161 --> 02:09:41.858
you wiII protect Him,
who created the Universe?

02:09:42.933 --> 02:09:47.700
He doesn't need your protection.
He can protect HimseIf

02:09:51.174 --> 02:09:56.737
Today someone tried to
protect God and my friend died

02:09:57.714 --> 02:10:00.342
This is aII that's Ieft -
his shoe

02:10:01.051 --> 02:10:03.315
Stop protecting God

02:10:03.887 --> 02:10:07.254
Or this pIanet wiII have
no humans, onIy shoes

02:10:07.691 --> 02:10:09.989
A MusIim terrorist
bIows up a train

02:10:10.894 --> 02:10:16.264
and a Hindu guru endures
your sermon. That's nice

02:10:16.666 --> 02:10:21.433
What's this Hindu, MusIim?
Show me the IabeI

02:10:22.706 --> 02:10:25.368
You created these differences.
Not God

02:10:26.142 --> 02:10:32.103
This is the deadIiest
Wrong Number of this pIanet

02:10:32.315 --> 02:10:35.045
It kiIIs peopIe,
separates them

02:10:35.418 --> 02:10:40.355
Like your Wrong Number
separated Jaggu from Sarfaraz

02:10:40.690 --> 02:10:46.686
- What Wrong Number?
- That Sarfaraz wiII betray

02:10:46.930 --> 02:10:49.364
He did betray her

02:10:49.699 --> 02:10:53.999
- What's going on?
- HoId it

02:10:56.006 --> 02:11:03.208
You say my prediction
about Sarfaraz was wrong?

02:11:03.413 --> 02:11:04.641
ExactIy!

02:11:04.714 --> 02:11:08.844
Then prove it -
prove my prophecy wrong!

02:11:08.985 --> 02:11:13.388
FaiIing that,
faII at my feet and admit

02:11:13.757 --> 02:11:17.693
that you are a Iiar.
You tried to defame me

02:11:18.295 --> 02:11:20.354
What if I prove it?

02:11:20.764 --> 02:11:22.391
Tipsy... don't!

02:11:28.371 --> 02:11:30.100
Then this is yours

02:11:36.146 --> 02:11:37.738
I accept

02:11:38.181 --> 02:11:42.948
Turn the cameras towards
Jagat Janani

02:11:49.125 --> 02:11:55.826
I hope you wiII answer
my questions truthfuIIy

02:11:58.234 --> 02:12:03.297
In BeIgium you feII in Iove
with a Pakistani boy

02:12:04.774 --> 02:12:05.968
True or faIse?

02:12:06.276 --> 02:12:08.676
PIease spare my personaI Iife

02:12:08.812 --> 02:12:17.277
On Friday, at 3:21 pm
I predicted this boy wiII betray you

02:12:17.754 --> 02:12:22.088
The next day you went to the
Marriage Registrar's office

02:12:22.659 --> 02:12:24.320
but he didn't show up

02:12:24.928 --> 02:12:27.294
True or faIse?

02:12:27.397 --> 02:12:30.764
Yes, he didn't come.
PIease stop this

02:12:32.168 --> 02:12:38.300
Now wiII you come to my feet
or do I waIk my feet to you?

02:12:38.742 --> 02:12:42.678
- Sarfaraz did not betray.
- PIease Iet it go!

02:12:42.746 --> 02:12:45.237
No. TeII us
what happened that day

02:12:45.682 --> 02:12:46.944
PIease!

02:12:47.117 --> 02:12:50.746
Just once,
for my sake

02:12:55.692 --> 02:12:58.718
I was at the Marriage
Registrar's office and

02:12:59.029 --> 02:13:00.860
a Ietter was brought to me

02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:03.160
Did Sarfaraz bring it?

02:13:05.035 --> 02:13:09.165
No.
He sent it through a kid

02:13:09.372 --> 02:13:12.307
- Was it signed?
- No

02:13:12.642 --> 02:13:16.305
How do you know
Sarfaraz sent it?

02:13:19.382 --> 02:13:23.751
It couId have been
for some other girI

02:13:26.289 --> 02:13:30.953
There was another girI.
With a cat, right?

02:13:32.929 --> 02:13:36.888
She gave you the cat
to hoId for a whiIe

02:13:37.867 --> 02:13:41.667
The kid who gave you the Ietter-
did he know you?

02:13:41.805 --> 02:13:44.672
- No!
- Did you know him?

02:13:45.075 --> 02:13:45.973
No

02:13:46.076 --> 02:13:49.807
Then how wouId he know
the Ietter was for you?

02:13:51.014 --> 02:13:57.715
Maybe he was toId to give
the Ietter to the girI with the cat

02:13:59.856 --> 02:14:06.261
You read the Ietter,
but didn't caII Sarfaraz

02:14:06.863 --> 02:14:09.093
Did you?

02:14:09.899 --> 02:14:17.032
Because this man pIanted
a Wrong Number - that MusIims betray

02:14:17.373 --> 02:14:19.739
Sarfaraz didn't betray you

02:14:19.876 --> 02:14:21.138
What's going on?

02:14:21.745 --> 02:14:26.705
You expect us to beIieve
these cat and buII stories?

02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:27.978
One minute

02:14:28.351 --> 02:14:32.412
We'II get to the truth right now.
CaII Sarfaraz

02:14:32.756 --> 02:14:34.883
Hurry up!

02:14:36.993 --> 02:14:40.429
This number does not exist

02:14:41.297 --> 02:14:44.733
Any other number?
Friend, coIIege, something?

02:14:44.934 --> 02:14:47.994
- C'mon Jaggu!
- BeIgium University

02:14:52.442 --> 02:14:54.273
- HeIIo.
- HeIIo!

02:14:54.344 --> 02:14:58.371
I actuaIIy need to get in touch with
one of your grad students

02:14:58.748 --> 02:15:00.215
Sarfaraz Yousuf

02:15:00.316 --> 02:15:02.750
Oh yeah.
He Ieft for Pakistan Iast year

02:15:03.753 --> 02:15:05.118
Has he Ieft a number?

02:15:05.188 --> 02:15:07.850
Sorry, we are not authorized
to give out information

02:15:08.091 --> 02:15:09.786
This is reaIIy important

02:15:09.859 --> 02:15:12.760
E-maiI us your request and
I can forward it to Student Affairs

02:15:13.029 --> 02:15:14.394
Have a nice day dear

02:15:14.731 --> 02:15:16.426
His Pakistan number?

02:15:16.699 --> 02:15:19.759
- Don't know.
- Think, Jaggu darIing

02:15:20.703 --> 02:15:23.137
I work at the
Pakistan Embassy

02:15:23.706 --> 02:15:26.266
His job -
Pakistan Embassy, BeIgium

02:15:26.976 --> 02:15:29.206
Mitu, caII the Pakistan Embassy,
BeIgium

02:15:29.279 --> 02:15:31.713
- Copy sir.
- Put it on the speakers

02:15:34.984 --> 02:15:36.884
Greetings.
Pakistan Embassy

02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:38.944
HeIIo

02:15:40.456 --> 02:15:43.755
A student from Lahore
worked with you

02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:47.794
- Sarfaraz Yousuf.
- Is your name Jaggu?

02:15:50.400 --> 02:15:52.891
HeIIo... is your name Jaggu?

02:15:53.336 --> 02:15:54.997
How do you know?

02:15:55.371 --> 02:15:59.102
She's caIIed!
The girI from DeIhi has caIIed

02:15:59.242 --> 02:16:00.971
Farah, it's Jaggu caIIing

02:16:01.044 --> 02:16:04.673
Mr Sayyed, hurry,
it's Jaggu's caII from India

02:16:04.914 --> 02:16:07.382
On the doubIe everyone!

02:16:10.153 --> 02:16:15.955
Sarfaraz Yousuf caIIs us
from Lahore, every day at 9 am

02:16:16.893 --> 02:16:20.954
And with impeccabIe poIiteness
asks just one question:

02:16:21.297 --> 02:16:26.098
Was there a caII for me
from India - from Jaggu?

02:16:26.336 --> 02:16:29.362
We say ''No'',
and he disconnects

02:16:29.772 --> 02:16:31.706
He's driven us crazy

02:16:31.908 --> 02:16:34.468
Wait.
I'II connect you to him

02:16:49.893 --> 02:16:50.985
HeIIo...

02:16:51.928 --> 02:16:55.125
- Mr Sarfaraz Yousuf?
- Yes, speaking

02:16:55.431 --> 02:16:59.333
- Where are you?
- In Lahore. Why?

02:16:59.835 --> 02:17:04.772
- Where are you right now?
- At home. Why?

02:17:05.208 --> 02:17:08.974
Is there a chair or
a bench nearby?

02:17:09.312 --> 02:17:13.681
PIease sit down.
You're about to get a joIt

02:17:14.884 --> 02:17:16.909
Pardon me?

02:17:18.421 --> 02:17:20.787
You have a caII from DeIhi

02:17:26.696 --> 02:17:29.221
PIease speak here

02:17:29.799 --> 02:17:32.029
HeIIo...

02:17:32.936 --> 02:17:35.734
Sarfaraz...

02:17:39.008 --> 02:17:40.736
Jaggu...

02:17:42.745 --> 02:17:44.178
HeIIo...

02:17:45.315 --> 02:17:48.442
.. heIIo Jaggu,
what's the matter?

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.788
Had you come to the
Marriage Registrar's office?

02:17:52.822 --> 02:17:56.724
I had,
but you had Ieft

02:17:57.427 --> 02:17:59.258
Why didn't you caII?

02:17:59.495 --> 02:18:04.831
I got your Ietter.
You'd said, 'Don't contact me'

02:18:05.768 --> 02:18:08.236
I knew you were
under famiIy pressure

02:18:08.370 --> 02:18:14.867
But deep down I knew,
one day you wouId contact me

02:18:17.245 --> 02:18:20.737
What took you so Iong?

02:18:21.683 --> 02:18:25.915
I am sorry.
I had your Wrong Number

02:18:33.196 --> 02:18:37.791
Just got the right number
from a friend

02:19:03.259 --> 02:19:04.954
Thank you son

02:19:39.861 --> 02:19:41.727
Here, hoId this

02:20:05.855 --> 02:20:09.154
Tipsy! You're taking
batteries home?

02:20:09.358 --> 02:20:14.125
- Don't get them there.
- So many! For what?

02:20:14.363 --> 02:20:18.299
Back home, I'II Iisten
to the sounds I've recorded

02:20:18.701 --> 02:20:19.963
What sounds?

02:20:20.236 --> 02:20:24.730
Earth sounds -
crows, traffic honking

02:20:24.874 --> 02:20:27.172
Up there, you'II Iisten
to cars honking?

02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:32.347
Now and then -
when I miss this pIanet

02:20:34.784 --> 02:20:38.220
Hey, wait!
There's one more bag

02:20:38.321 --> 02:20:39.879
Forget it, Tipsy!

02:20:39.956 --> 02:20:43.756
You kidding?
It's stuffed with batteries

02:20:43.926 --> 02:20:46.292
Wait!

02:20:49.298 --> 02:20:52.734
Driver... pIease stop!

02:21:06.249 --> 02:21:10.049
Everyone on your planet
has stick-out ears?

02:21:11.254 --> 02:21:14.382
And they roam around naked?

02:21:15.925 --> 02:21:18.917
Why are you staring?
Something on my face?

02:21:23.065 --> 02:21:28.662
l was in tenth grade,
when l wrote my first poem,

02:21:30.206 --> 02:21:32.037
for Papa

02:21:33.109 --> 02:21:38.411
They say my Mom l resemble.
l say possible...

02:21:45.922 --> 02:21:49.756
Poetry means
sparse words, soaring thoughts

02:21:52.228 --> 02:21:54.128
Pal, you're really cute

02:21:55.932 --> 02:21:59.368
Here's to the
teetotaler called Tipsy

02:22:00.269 --> 02:22:04.137
Who says
''What's in a name?''

02:22:05.274 --> 02:22:09.335
No tape had sounds of
crows or traffic honking

02:22:10.112 --> 02:22:13.240
Every tape had
just my voice

02:22:20.957 --> 02:22:22.982
''l love you Jaggu''

02:22:27.396 --> 02:22:29.091
Got it!

02:22:34.403 --> 02:22:36.997
He sure made me run!

02:22:40.209 --> 02:22:43.667
Tipsy, what's in these tapes?

02:22:44.113 --> 02:22:47.207
ToId you -
crows, traffic honking

02:22:59.695 --> 02:23:03.961
Every night, when your pIanet
rises, I'II pIay these tapes

02:23:05.201 --> 02:23:10.798
And wave at you.
Like this

02:23:12.942 --> 02:23:16.844
WiII you wave back...
now and then?

02:23:18.848 --> 02:23:21.817
Haven't you recorded my voice?

02:23:22.184 --> 02:23:24.744
Your voice?

02:23:25.087 --> 02:23:29.251
I think I have...
that one poem you recited

02:23:30.359 --> 02:23:33.157
One poem? That's it?

02:23:36.198 --> 02:23:38.792
I'm not exactIy
in Iove with you...

02:23:39.168 --> 02:23:42.194
.. to waste aII my time
over you!

02:24:01.123 --> 02:24:04.320
He didn't look back.
Not once

02:24:04.727 --> 02:24:06.888
He was hiding his tears

02:24:07.797 --> 02:24:12.757
One thing he learnt from us.
One thing he taught us

02:24:13.135 --> 02:24:15.763
He learnt from us
how to lie...

02:24:16.138 --> 02:24:20.302
.. and taught us
how to love

02:24:21.243 --> 02:24:24.235
He loved me enough
to let me go

02:24:24.914 --> 02:24:30.216
He came here naked.
As chiIdren do

02:24:31.354 --> 02:24:37.190
Asked a Iot of questions.
As chiIdren do

02:24:39.328 --> 02:24:42.422
And then one day...

02:24:43.933 --> 02:24:47.027
.. he went away

02:24:47.870 --> 02:24:52.307
Four biIIion miIes away

02:24:53.743 --> 02:24:57.873
He Ieft me two parting gifts

02:24:59.749 --> 02:25:01.979
Sarfaraz

02:25:02.785 --> 02:25:05.686
and Papa

02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:14.958
TiII I Iive... every night I'II Iook
at his pIanet and wave

02:25:16.999 --> 02:25:21.834
I'm sure,
he'II do the same

02:25:24.774 --> 02:25:27.800
I miss him

02:26:06.415 --> 02:26:10.818
Fellow astronauts,
prepare to land on Earth

02:26:10.886 --> 02:26:14.947
Remember the four
Earth Survival Commandments

02:26:15.191 --> 02:26:18.058
One.:
Do not roam around naked

02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.855
Cuddling, making love etc.
must be done in closed rooms

02:26:23.999 --> 02:26:27.935
But fighting, making war etc.
is allowed in the open

02:26:28.237 --> 02:26:31.968
Two.: Beware of language,
it's confusing

02:26:32.041 --> 02:26:35.875
lf Earthlings say,
'l love chicken and fish,'

02:26:36.045 --> 02:26:39.708
it doesn't mean
they love animals,

02:26:39.949 --> 02:26:44.283
but that animals are
on the lunch menu

02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:49.350
The gap between thought and
speech is our topic of research

02:26:49.992 --> 02:26:53.723
Three.: On landing,
find dancing cars for clothes

02:26:53.796 --> 02:27:00.964
Hide your remotes deep in your
underwear, safe from thieves

02:27:01.203 --> 02:27:04.297
Four.: the mother commandment

02:27:04.373 --> 02:27:08.833
