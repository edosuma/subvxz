WEBVTT

00:06.798 --> 00:09.540
Hey, you got me up
for this.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.299
Yeah, sorry.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.807
Eh, worrying ain't gonna
get 'em back any faster.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.558
We should go
after them, man.

00:20.604 --> 00:22.686
They'll be back
when they get back.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.689
Now, just clear
your mind.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.190
All right.
( cocks gun )

00:30.531 --> 00:32.647
( music playing )

00:34.576 --> 00:36.157
They should be back.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.658
They will be.

00:46.588 --> 00:49.671
Hey, Troy promised
to keep Madison safe.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.296
He promised me.
That means something to him.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.549
Does it?

00:56.598 --> 00:57.804
Yeah.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.598
l protected him
when we were little.

01:03.647 --> 01:05.103
You can trust him.

01:05.148 --> 01:07.139
On this, at least.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.683
I'm more worried about
the people who shot us down.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.913
( music playing )

01:26.169 --> 01:28.626
(wincing )

01:34.094 --> 01:37.006
( gate squeaking open )

01:39.349 --> 01:41.385
- Nick: Jesus, Mom.
- Gretchen: Mike!

01:41.435 --> 01:43.391
( groans )

01:45.105 --> 01:47.061
- Man: On the road.
- Man #2: Come on.

01:47.107 --> 01:50.019
(overlapping chatter)

01:56.158 --> 01:57.898
( music playing )

02:00.912 --> 02:02.618
Man:
You all right?

02:02.664 --> 02:05.326
( overlapping chatter)

02:05.375 --> 02:06.626
What the hell happened?

02:06.668 --> 02:08.784
We should talk private.

02:08.837 --> 02:11.544
Talk private?
Did I hear you right?

02:11.590 --> 02:14.957
Coop, Mike, inside.
Let's debrief.

02:15.010 --> 02:16.591
Like hell, Jeremiah.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.923
We all got a right
to hear what went down.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.349
- You're out of line, Vern.
- We got a right to know what happened.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.507
We need to know
how to defend ourselves.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.141
- We gotta know...
- They were Indians.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.269
(crowd murmuring )

02:29.608 --> 02:31.439
- They slaughtered them.
- All right, all right.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.725
They slaughtered
all of them.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.019
We made it home, huh?

02:35.072 --> 02:37.154
It's nothing
we can't handle.

02:37.199 --> 02:38.905
They're dead.
They're all dead.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.690
Mike, lock your shit down.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.154
Lock it down.

02:42.204 --> 02:44.991
- They're dead.
- ( crowd whispering )

02:46.708 --> 02:48.323
- (whispers ) Shut up.
- Man: Is that true?

02:48.377 --> 02:50.743
- Mike: If we stay, we...
- Troy: Mike, shut the hell up.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.377
If we stay, we die!

03:14.653 --> 03:17.190
Troy: No, no, no,
we go after them.

03:17.239 --> 03:18.820
Now.
We hit them back.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.403
So you can stroll into
another ambush, Colonel Custer?

03:22.452 --> 03:23.407
There was no way
to know.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.409
- ( scoffs ) No?
- No.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.491
- Did you scout the campsite first?
- Dad.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.452
Huh?
Hike the perimeter?

03:29.501 --> 03:31.867
Or did you suffer
some distraction?

03:31.920 --> 03:34.206
Were your already
tasting the blood?

03:34.256 --> 03:35.871
It wasn't Troy's fault.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.666
Oh, you an expert?

03:38.719 --> 03:41.051
No, we...
we were cautious.

03:41.096 --> 03:44.213
Ah. Well, let's extend
the caution now.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.552
We're not attacking.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.058
We're right to hold off,

03:49.104 --> 03:51.345
but Walker’s
not going away.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.934
He's weak.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.770
That chickenshit atrocity
he pulled with Phil...

03:55.819 --> 03:57.229
If he's weak,
he'll negotiate.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.021
Negotiate?
There's nothing to negotiate.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.779
It's our land
or their land.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.440
I mean, we either
stole it or we didn’t.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.448
Stole?

04:05.829 --> 04:07.660
Is this their land?

04:07.706 --> 04:11.290
Every acre you tread is owned
and was owned before...

04:11.334 --> 04:14.121
boughLIeased,
or stolen in between.

04:14.171 --> 04:15.911
And what about the ranch?

04:15.964 --> 04:18.455
It was sold
to my forebears.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.123
And what the hell
does it matter now?

04:20.177 --> 04:21.963
It matters
if he doesn't stop.

04:22.012 --> 04:25.345
It matters if your people think
they're on the wrong side.

04:25.390 --> 04:28.507
Hey, this is my business
to manage.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.767
Don't mistake yourself
or your place.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.393
Jake: Dad, she's trying
to understand.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.646
Walker's a tribal lawyer.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.192
Sued us since forever.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.611
l handled it
last couple years.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.189
And we beat him
every time.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.103
And what if he comes back
to the door now?

04:42.157 --> 04:43.693
He won't.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.653
You've never seen
the Black Hat Reservation.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.115
- Mm-mm.
- It's a truck stop, motel, and market.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.951
Rocks and asphalt,
liquor and oxy,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.334
drunken, diabetic
welfare cheats.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.290
| feel your
liberal judgment.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.001
lt's palpable.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.507
- But that's not racism.
- Isn't it?

05:02.552 --> 05:05.214
No. It's truth.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.380
And I'm talking about
before the apocalypse.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.344
Doubt it's
improved much since.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.974
You say
what you want,

05:12.020 --> 05:15.683
but the man
I saw yesterday was a threat.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.268
He had command.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.526
Yeah?
You got a little crush?

05:21.571 --> 05:23.311
We gotta tell people
something.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.026
You talk to them.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.033
It's good they start hearing
more from you anyway, Jake.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.577
What do you
want me to say?

05:31.623 --> 05:36.458
Just say we got weapons
and walls and wherewithal.

05:36.503 --> 05:40.337
Say all civilizations
are born of violence.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.498
People give me
a headache.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.712
- Jake: Troy should come with me.
(door opens)

05:44.761 --> 05:46.968
- He was there, Da...
(door slams)

05:51.977 --> 05:54.309
- Alicia: Got it?
- ( Madison exhales ) Okay. I got it, I got it.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.686
I've got it.
Okay.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.906
- Here, take this off.
- Oh, God.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.407
Thank you.

06:22.090 --> 06:24.456
- Here.
- Careful.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.344
(gasps )

06:29.389 --> 06:30.674
Alicia:
Oh, ll/Iom...

06:30.724 --> 06:34.433
Oh, God.
(sighs )

06:34.477 --> 06:35.557
Damn.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.190
She went south.
She knew people in Mexicali.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.029
I'm sorry.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.196
She's strong.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.539
So are you.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.765
Alicia: Hey!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.605
Hey.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.072
Sorry...

07:28.114 --> 07:29.570
about the people
youlost

07:29.616 --> 07:32.608
I didn't know
most of them.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.949
Phil McCarthy was here
since the beginning, but...

07:35.997 --> 07:37.453
he wasn't a good man.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.205
Your mom okay?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.286
Will be.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.826
Your dad?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.837
No.
Not really, no.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.248
He's one of the last ones
standing.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.132
And he's feeling that.

07:50.178 --> 07:53.796
Russell lost in the fire,
McCarthy dead now.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.807
Vernon's the only other
Founding Father left.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.638
Just getting picked off
one by one.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.100
Are you afraid?

08:03.149 --> 08:05.526
No.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.900
Border's a violent place,
always has been.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.397
Show me?

08:23.503 --> 08:25.414
- ( clicking )
- Safety.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.294
Semi-auto,
like a pistol.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.002
- Full auto. Stick with semi.
- ( gun clicks )

08:35.932 --> 08:37.593
Don't I need
a new target?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.803
Mine'll be the ones
in the bulls-eye.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.026
What happens
when your dad goes?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.524
Who takes over
the ranch?

08:48.570 --> 08:50.026
Most people here
are libertarians.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.686
They don't take orders
very well.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.947
Tuck the stock
into your shoulder.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.448
Don't tense.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.074
Yeah, but people
look up to your dad.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.610
Yeah, it was his land.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.040
lt'll pass to me and Troy
when he dies,

09:01.082 --> 09:05.621
but people look to whoever
they feel is worth looking to.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.786
Could be anybody.
Could be you.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.172
Your father
wants it to be you.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.590
Why wouldn't it be?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.503
You're right, people
are gonna look to somebody.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.557
And if it's not you...

09:34.532 --> 09:36.864
Breathe out
when you squeeze the trigger.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.496
( knock on door)

09:46.544 --> 09:48.751
Come in.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.539
( distant gunfire )
- Sorry, Madison, sorry.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.502
l was just looking
for Alicia.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.462
She's out and about,
Gretchen.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.629
Probably with Jake.
l'll... I'll just...

09:58.681 --> 10:00.012
Is Mike okay?

10:01.184 --> 10:03.300
Freaked.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.560
He said you
saved him, though.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.142
He said everybody
would have died without you.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.227
Come in.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.607
( door closes )

10:14.948 --> 10:17.030
lt isn'tjust my brother.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.940
It's my whole family,
my father.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.245
Vernon?
Sit down.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.914
My dad doesn't think
we're safe.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.999
He helped make this place,
doesn't think it's safe.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.789
I've never seen him scared,
not even when the dead rose.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.753
- But he is.
- What'd he say?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.963
He said he should have known,
that it would never end,

10:38.012 --> 10:40.298
- that violence begets violence.
- Wait, wait, slow down, slow down.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.805
He said it's just starting.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.842
He wants to go.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.759
He wants to leave the ranch.
I'm scared.

10:46.813 --> 10:49.225
Shh, listen to me.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.310
There's no place safer
than here.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.816
Well, he doesn't
believe that.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.194
He knows a colony
in Colorado.

10:56.239 --> 11:01.029
Dad says the Rockies
will be safe, at elevation.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.988
Who did he say that to?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.198
Anyone who will listen.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.912
He's a founder.

11:35.862 --> 11:39.650
( distant howling )

11:45.455 --> 11:48.993
( distant barking,
howling )

11:51.836 --> 11:54.168
( music playing )

12:01.179 --> 12:02.794
(cocks gun )

12:06.309 --> 12:08.095
Distant man:
Fire!

12:09.729 --> 12:12.562
Fire!
We got fire!

12:12.607 --> 12:15.474
( overlapping shouting )

12:15.526 --> 12:17.141
Woman:
What's happening?

12:18.863 --> 12:21.104
Man:
Everybody out!

12:21.157 --> 12:22.613
Woman #2:
No, they’re everywhere!

12:22.659 --> 12:24.900
Man #2:
They're all over the place!

12:24.953 --> 12:27.990
( shouting continues )

12:29.874 --> 12:31.830
Son of a bitch.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.209
( shouting continues )

12:46.182 --> 12:48.673
( music playing )

12:50.478 --> 12:52.218
50 yards
from the front gate.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.808
What the hell
was that sentry doing?

12:53.856 --> 12:54.982
How many total?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.015
Militia counts about 20.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.933
All built to die
like this one.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.693
It's not meant
to burn us out.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.069
They want the land
in one piece.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.946
They want us off of it,
like they said.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.734
They don't have the arms
or the balls,

13:06.786 --> 13:08.902
so they do this bullshit.

13:08.955 --> 13:12.413
If Walker was gonna come,
he would have.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.868
But he can 't.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.291
Your people are scared,
Jeremiah.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.547
( music playing )

13:25.596 --> 13:27.848
(chatter)
- ( grunts )

13:31.853 --> 13:33.309
(grunts)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.277
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.781
What brings you
down here?

13:46.826 --> 13:49.112
Uh, lumber?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.323
Drywall screws.

13:51.372 --> 13:53.454
You flying solo?

13:53.499 --> 13:57.742
- What?
- Luciana, she, uh... she take off?

13:57.795 --> 14:00.127
Do me a favor.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.129
Say her name again.

14:02.175 --> 14:06.009
Whoa, whoa,
easy, easy, partner.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.794
It's just good
you didn't take off after her.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.758
That's all I'm saying.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.343
- Okay?
( footsteps approach )

14:11.392 --> 14:13.678
Whoa, Dax, Dax,
what are you doing?

14:13.728 --> 14:15.810
Huh?
- Don't start, Troy.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.221
No, this is not a good time
to cut bait, Mrs. Daley.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.060
Feels like the best time.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.976
l have sacrificed too much.

14:23.029 --> 14:26.192
Not gonna wait for them
to finish off my entire family.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.617
They will pay.
They will pay for what they did.

14:28.659 --> 14:32.823
Now, Dax...
put the flour back.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.909
I'm sorry Troy.
We've just been thinking...

14:35.958 --> 14:37.664
Thinking? Thinking?

14:37.710 --> 14:40.417
Thinking about stealing
our shit and hauling ass?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.669
Huh?

14:44.092 --> 14:47.129
This is what we put in.
Following the rules here.

14:47.178 --> 14:51.091
Oh, the rules.
Right, the rules.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.677
Well, the rules are here
for the members of our community.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.182
You leave,
you're not a member.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.059
Take it up
with your father.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.221
We spoke this morning.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.898
All right.

15:05.947 --> 15:07.153
Okay.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.905
( clears throat )

15:15.206 --> 15:16.992
( groans )

15:17.041 --> 15:18.872
We should talk.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.705
Um, should we?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.290
I may disappoint.

15:23.339 --> 15:26.206
- Listen, Vernon is...
- Wha...

15:26.259 --> 15:28.170
Headaches still?

15:28.219 --> 15:31.052
Migraines.
You get 'em?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.428
Unh-unh.
Father did.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.088
The light would start
to hurt him.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.382
- Oh.
- Jeremiah...

15:35.435 --> 15:37.300
What did you wanna say
about Vernon?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.093
- He's...
- Right here.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.644
- Jeremiah, can I get a word?
- Hmm?

15:43.693 --> 15:45.024
Yeah.
You're having one.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.060
Uh, in private.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.526
There's nothing you can't
say in front of Madison or anybody else.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.699
Look, we're friends
going on 30 years.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.203
You know I love
this place.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.365
I love what we started.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.910
But a man's family
comes first.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.544
Just gotta protect them
best he knows how,

16:05.590 --> 16:08.582
and the best I know how
istoleave.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.920
Now.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.086
A little precipitous,
don't you think?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.471
Run off at the first sign
of trouble?

16:15.516 --> 16:18.303
Sign of trouble?
They killed eight of ours.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.889
They sawed Phil's...

16:20.938 --> 16:22.678
Hell, Otto,
that could've been...

16:22.732 --> 16:24.768
All right,
all right.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.148
All right?

16:26.194 --> 16:27.934
Well, what do you
want me to say?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.648
You don't need
my permission.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.653
You wanna go, go.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.494
You don't wanna go
out there, Mr. Trimbol.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.743
My mind's made up.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.448
I'm sorry, Jeremiah.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.787
Mike going with you?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.628
My family's leaving,
Troy.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.465
30 years, huh?

16:55.515 --> 16:58.302
He wasn't always
like that.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.639
Some men, they have kids,
turns them into women.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.354
He's a founder.

17:05.399 --> 17:06.525
If you can't
keep him here,

17:06.567 --> 17:08.068
how you gonna keep
the rest of them?

17:08.110 --> 17:10.567
Well, what would
you have me do, hmm?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.399
Give them a reason
to stay, fight.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.313
Give them a reason?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.029
Aside from the fences
and the militia

17:17.078 --> 17:19.569
and the stores
and this community, huh?

17:19.622 --> 17:22.113
| welcome them onto my land
with open arms,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.157
and now I gotta get down
on my hands and knees

17:24.210 --> 17:25.700
and beg 'em to stay?

17:25.753 --> 17:27.038
There's a fight coming.

17:27.088 --> 17:29.329
Everyone who leaves
leaves us weaker.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.838
( groans )

17:30.883 --> 17:32.714
To hell with this.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.341
Troy!

17:42.353 --> 17:44.014
Keep that gate closed,
Jimmy!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.099
- Your father gave the okay.
- I don't give a damn.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.809
You open that gate
and I shoot you in the head.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.063
Open the door.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.650
- I'm not doing this, Troy.
- Open the door, Vernon.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.235
Mike? Mike, get your ass
out here now.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.279
Come on,
get your ass out here.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.912
People died for us, Mike!

18:03.958 --> 18:07.075
Our people,
and you're gonna run, huh?!

18:07.128 --> 18:09.835
- It's not what a man does, Mike!
- Troy. Troy!

18:09.880 --> 18:12.257
Troy, stand down.
Dad said they could leave.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.461
Yeah, he said they could leave,
not with ranch property.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.250
What property?
This is theirs.

18:16.304 --> 18:19.467
They gassed up, didn't they?
Gas is ranch property.

18:19.515 --> 18:22.678
And I guarantee you
that they took plenty of shit

18:22.727 --> 18:23.967
from the pantry!

18:24.020 --> 18:25.760
And I want to see
an inventory, Vernon!

18:25.813 --> 18:28.270
- I want it inspected!
- This is not what Dad wants.

18:28.316 --> 18:29.772
Why should I give a damn
what Dad wants?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.148
He never gives a shit
about me...

18:32.361 --> 18:34.647
You're not protecting
the ranch.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.029
The hell do you know
about it?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.655
You haven't a clue
what this ranch is about.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.612
I mean, she's been here
a week, and she gets it.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.239
You gonna fight for what's yours
or you gonna surrender it, huh?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.453
- That's not your call, is it?
- You gonna fight or you gonna surrender?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.242
You're not in charge,
are you?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.661
(grunts)

18:51.714 --> 18:54.080
What the hell
is wrong with you, huh?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.294
- No! Hey, Dad, Dad. Dad, Dad.
- Madison: No, no! Come on.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.800
Come on.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.175
God damn it.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.356
( gate opens )

19:15.905 --> 19:19.443
( music playing )

19:42.473 --> 19:44.134
( Troy sighs )

19:47.311 --> 19:50.098
Madison: Looking for something
to take out the old man?

19:50.147 --> 19:51.728
I've been there.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.898
It's the first thing
folks will grab

19:54.944 --> 19:56.684
if there's a run
on the place.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.193
Good.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.571
l was worried you might
do something rash.

20:00.616 --> 20:03.232
To my family?

20:03.285 --> 20:06.277
No, no.
Never.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.321
Can't blame my worry.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.410
No.

20:10.459 --> 20:13.246
All I've ever had
in my... my whole life

20:13.295 --> 20:16.378
is this...
this place and...

20:16.424 --> 20:17.880
these people, and...

20:20.761 --> 20:22.592
I don't know, it just...

20:24.098 --> 20:25.554
I don't understand,
you know.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.807
Like,
the world out there,

20:28.853 --> 20:31.344
it's, uh...

20:31.397 --> 20:32.853
it's burned.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.314
They wanted to see
for themselves.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.774
Anyone who leaves
is dead to me.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.946
Now, Mike, he was...

20:48.164 --> 20:50.120
he was soft,
but he was...

20:50.166 --> 20:52.202
he's been my friend
since I was a kid.

20:54.837 --> 20:58.079
He stayed in school
when I got... I got pulled.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.293
But he never quit on me.
Never.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.629
Even when others did.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.091
He didn't quit
on you, Troy.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.510
He just stood
by his family.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.144
He wouldn't look at me.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.023
He just...

21:22.865 --> 21:26.824
( sniffles ) Hard to know how to react
to something like that.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.201
You make sure
no one else leaves.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.907
( door opens )
(people chattering )

21:30.956 --> 21:33.368
Madison: Save them from
the same mistake.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.999
I'll help you.

21:36.045 --> 21:38.627
( chatter continues )

21:43.093 --> 21:44.674
( Troy clears throat )

21:45.846 --> 21:47.802
( chatter stops )

21:49.183 --> 21:51.094
I want you all
at attention.

21:58.859 --> 22:02.101
All right.
That's a start.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.530
Tracking Mike down and beating
his ass into the ground,

22:03.572 --> 22:05.108
that'd be a start.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.820
No, Mike's gone.
He's not coming back.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.825
That's the end of it.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.829
I don't want to hear
his name again.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.833
From now on,
we set an example.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.290
We become a model
of what this place needs...

22:20.339 --> 22:24.048
order, discipline,

22:24.093 --> 22:26.675
chain of command.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.929
We have to make
those people up there feel safe.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.011
(militiamen murmuring)

22:33.060 --> 22:35.802
Or they'll leave,
all of them.

22:35.855 --> 22:40.019
We have to defend
this ranch with our lives

22:40.067 --> 22:41.682
or they will
be slaughtered,

22:41.735 --> 22:43.771
all of them.

22:43.821 --> 22:47.029
This place, this place
is all we have.

22:48.826 --> 22:54.037
And right now,
it is... teetering.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.743
And the only thing
that can save it is us.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.000
Now, I'm not gonna draw
a line on the floor.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.208
I'm not asking
whether you're with me.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.589
You are with me,
all of you.

23:08.596 --> 23:10.302
Do you understand?

23:10.347 --> 23:12.178
All:
Yes, sir!

23:14.393 --> 23:17.135
( music playing )

23:18.439 --> 23:20.771
( crickets chirping )

23:22.776 --> 23:25.062
( rustling )

23:30.951 --> 23:32.031
(grunts)

23:34.872 --> 23:36.863
Jeremiah,
what are you doing?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.032
This is where it goes,
right here.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.546
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

23:45.591 --> 23:48.708
I've been drinking here
all night, alone.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.006
Here.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.763
No, thanks.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.353
Come on. You?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.681
Especially me.
I'm high on life.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.562
(laughing )

24:04.860 --> 24:06.851
I like that.
( laughs )

24:06.904 --> 24:08.860
- Hey, slow down.
- ( laughs )

24:08.906 --> 24:10.942
- Slow down.
- Mm.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.276
Ah.

24:12.326 --> 24:14.066
What happened
to your hand?

24:14.119 --> 24:17.532
Oh...
you know that song,

24:17.581 --> 24:19.412
"Can't be
with the one you love,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.164
love the one
you're with"?

24:21.210 --> 24:25.795
Well, that goes the same...

24:25.839 --> 24:27.830
with hitting people.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.295
( scoffs )
I don't mind.

24:32.429 --> 24:36.138
( stammers )
The hand...

24:36.183 --> 24:38.925
distracts
from the headaches.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.436
Well, listen, man,
tomorrow's another day,

24:42.481 --> 24:43.891
a better day,
'cause you're gonna be

24:43.941 --> 24:45.932
too hung over
to get in any fights.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.896
So why don't
you just crash here?

24:54.076 --> 24:56.613
This is a scared spot,
you know.

24:56.662 --> 25:00.200
Me and Vern and Russell
and McCarthy,

25:00.249 --> 25:02.490
we sat here
one night and...

25:04.837 --> 25:07.704
conceived the movement.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.372
( distant howling )

25:10.426 --> 25:12.041
My life's work.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.088
(grunts)

25:17.141 --> 25:20.178
Now two are dead and...

25:21.353 --> 25:23.059
one is dead to me.

25:26.025 --> 25:27.765
( glass shatters )

25:27.818 --> 25:29.433
God damn it, man.

25:34.992 --> 25:37.404
- (gun cocks)
- Jeremiah, no, no, no, hey!

25:41.415 --> 25:42.871
(gunshot)

25:51.341 --> 25:52.956
(grunts)

25:59.892 --> 26:02.053
I'm 5... I'm sorry.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.769
Your home.
Your gun.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.195
There's blood in it.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.785
It's in the earth.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.286
It's in the earth.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.574
- (Jeremiah exhales )
( distant howling continues )

26:39.389 --> 26:41.175
( door closes )

26:45.938 --> 26:47.553
Bible study?
- (gasps )

26:54.154 --> 26:55.735
Jake's.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.112
Jake?

27:01.161 --> 27:02.617
It's nothing serious.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.577
The rhythm method is bullshit.
I told you that, right?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.166
Yes, when I was 13.

27:13.215 --> 27:15.251
I thought you were
talking about a band.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.386
There's birth control
in the pantry.

27:24.434 --> 27:28.302
I'm sorry, it's just
the stakes are so much higher now.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.938
You like him?

27:38.991 --> 27:41.607
Like, yeah.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.946
I'm not in love.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.987
Been in love.
This isn't it.

27:47.291 --> 27:49.452
It can creep up on you.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.787
Jake's important to us.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.629
And I like him.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.132
In that order?

28:01.180 --> 28:03.011
Does there have
to be an order?

28:08.437 --> 28:10.974
( crow cawing )
- (Jeremiah sighs )

28:15.110 --> 28:16.771
It's bright.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.776
Good morning.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.314
So, I raided the pantry.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.653
Turns out "It's for Otto"
goes a long way.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.870
No, thanks.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.664
About last night...

28:34.713 --> 28:36.078
Last night I was
at the bunkhouse

28:36.131 --> 28:38.213
with my mom and Alicia.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.340
Why, did I miss anything?

28:46.683 --> 28:49.595
( horse whinnies )

28:49.645 --> 28:52.352
( snorting )

28:54.441 --> 28:57.023
How long
has that been there?

28:57.069 --> 28:59.560
( whinnies )

29:07.579 --> 29:08.955
Is it one of ours?

29:11.792 --> 29:13.202
It's Vern's.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.538
Go get your mother.
- Why?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.578
Just go get your mother.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.001
( nickers )

29:30.477 --> 29:33.310
( music playing )

29:42.447 --> 29:44.938
They could have let it out.
It's a long way to go.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.074
Two horses, a lot of feed,
lot of water.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.404
They'd have slaughtered it.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.991
They'd have killed it
if it were like that.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.241
Treat the hide.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.704
Cure the meat.

29:56.753 --> 29:58.493
They wouldn't
just free it.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.003
So it escaped.

30:01.341 --> 30:02.842
They're dead.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.627
I know it.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.217
It's just a question
of how they got that way.

30:11.476 --> 30:12.682
Be ready for that.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.194
"Black Hat Reservation"?

30:28.243 --> 30:31.360
I'm going to Walker.
I'm gonna work this out.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.278
I've known him for years.
I know Black Hat.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.947
- You need a map to get there?
- No.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.876
I'm going off-grid.
Back way.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.048
It'll take longer,
but it's safer.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.341
- Safer from Walker.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.049
Safer from my father in case
he sends Troy to stop me.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.470
He should stop you.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.254
He killed your people.
He killed Travis.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.592
He wasn't trying
to kill Travis.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.768
No, he was trying
to kill you.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.677
Yeah, good people die
easy as bad.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.346
- What does that even mean?
- It's what I'm trying to stop.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.139
More people will die.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.933
You're right,
I... I have to be

31:02.986 --> 31:05.068
more than just a voice
in my father's ear.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.276
I meant for you to step up
inside the camp, Jake,

31:08.325 --> 31:09.940
not to go out
on some suicide mission.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.574
I'm the only one
that can do this.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.156
I've dealt with him.
I've settled with him.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.947
- I've beaten him.
- When there were courts!

31:15.999 --> 31:18.240
When there
was rule of law!

31:18.293 --> 31:20.534
Walker's not crazy.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.543
He's just fighting
for his people who need him,

31:22.589 --> 31:24.796
people who always
got a raw deal.

31:24.841 --> 31:28.379
Jake, I'm asking you
not to go.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.590
Stay ready.

32:14.808 --> 32:16.298
(baton clinks)

32:25.986 --> 32:28.648
( thudding, rustling )

32:35.078 --> 32:37.034
( infected snarling )

32:40.041 --> 32:42.168
( thudding, clattering )

32:42.210 --> 32:44.622
( snarling continues )

32:44.671 --> 32:48.334
( gunshots )
( bodies thudding )

32:48.383 --> 32:49.998
( snarling stops )

32:54.055 --> 32:56.182
( door opens )

32:56.224 --> 32:57.384
Vernon?

32:57.434 --> 33:00.221
Kathy, too.

33:00.270 --> 33:03.012
( infected snarling )
( horse groaning )

33:04.608 --> 33:05.848
Mike.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.361
( clanging )
( horse grunting )

33:15.410 --> 33:17.992
( infected snarling )
( thumping )

33:20.123 --> 33:23.081
( horse screaming )

33:23.126 --> 33:25.617
( munching )

33:27.923 --> 33:31.006
- ( breathing heavily)
( infecting munching )

33:43.396 --> 33:44.431
(gunshot)

33:44.481 --> 33:45.561
( snarling )

33:54.241 --> 33:56.448
( snarling )

34:04.543 --> 34:05.908
Jeremiah:
You gonna shoot?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.810
You all right?

34:33.863 --> 34:35.728
She's Alicia's age.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.281
Yeah.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.287
He thinks it was Troy.

34:44.332 --> 34:45.993
No, I don't think so.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.159
Don't think so
or you don't want to?

34:49.212 --> 34:51.544
Even for Troy, this is...

34:51.590 --> 34:54.798
We know Walker was close.
I've seen what he's done.

34:54.843 --> 34:57.380
Indians, right?

34:57.429 --> 35:00.546
Took everything?
Took the helicopter?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.510
- Even took your shoes?
- Yeah.

35:02.559 --> 35:05.801
Would they leave this?

35:05.854 --> 35:08.846
Horses? The RV?

35:08.898 --> 35:11.150
There's a week's worth
of food and supplies in there.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.148
(flies buzzing )

35:21.411 --> 35:24.824
All the things
he's done...

35:24.873 --> 35:27.580
never anything like this.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.958
Not to his own people.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.584
Can't be
absolutely sure.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.292
I don't think of him
as a man.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.334
My boys, they go away
a couple days,

35:38.386 --> 35:39.922
they come to mind.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.678
It's like they're seven,
eight years old again.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.472
I don't know what to do.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.729
We have to go back.

35:55.779 --> 35:56.734
Now.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.280
Man: Troy!

36:01.326 --> 36:04.159
( music playing )

36:08.083 --> 36:10.290
( chatter )

36:43.368 --> 36:46.326
(people sobbing,
murmuring )

36:50.542 --> 36:53.500
Woman:
What happened to them?

36:53.545 --> 36:56.207
I'm sorry.

36:56.256 --> 36:59.589
They were good people.
They didn't deserve this end.

36:59.634 --> 37:03.593
Our family, we...
we weren't prepared like you.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.345
We were strangers,
but you took us in.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.131
We ’ve come
to love it here.

37:09.769 --> 37:13.136
I wish... my husband
had lived to see it.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.730
But he was killed.

37:17.485 --> 37:19.601
Travis was killed.

37:22.073 --> 37:24.359
He was killed by the same
people who killed Phil

37:24.409 --> 37:26.149
and our people
at the outpost.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.871
The same people...

37:37.130 --> 37:38.916
Walker's people...

37:40.675 --> 37:43.792
have now killed
our friends...

37:43.845 --> 37:47.258
Vernon, Kathy, Mike...

37:47.307 --> 37:49.719
Gretchen.
- This is crazy, dude.

37:49.768 --> 37:53.306
I've seen firsthand
how Walker treats his victims.

37:53.354 --> 37:57.142
I saw it at the outpost,
and I just now saw it again.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.899
You built this place
together.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.230
Because of that,
you've been safe and sheltered.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.316
You haven’t been
out in the world. We have.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.949
I'm telling you,
there's nothing out there.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.406
If you leave, you'll die.

38:10.455 --> 38:13.572
Walker’s people aren’t strong
enough to force us off this land.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.081
The y're trying
to scare us.

38:15.126 --> 38:16.457
That's how
they want us to go...

38:16.503 --> 38:19.245
a family or two
at a time,

38:19.297 --> 38:22.460
out there alone
where nobody can see,

38:22.509 --> 38:25.125
where our militia
can't protect us.

38:25.178 --> 38:27.920
We cannot let ourselves
be fractured.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.508
There are more of us.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.809
- We're better armed.
- ( people murmuring)

38:31.851 --> 38:35.184
If we stay here together,
we live.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.892
(murmuring grows louder)

38:37.941 --> 38:40.023
Woman:
Yes. Yeah.

38:40.068 --> 38:42.935
( music playing )

38:49.202 --> 38:51.409
( music playing )

39:05.927 --> 39:07.838
( chatter)

39:10.181 --> 39:12.137
( chatter continues )

39:16.771 --> 39:18.978
That was impressive
as all hell.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.275
It was necessary.

39:22.861 --> 39:26.900
How do you tell a lie
that big and sleep at night?

39:26.948 --> 39:29.530
How do you do that?

39:29.576 --> 39:31.237
What I said was true.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.868
None of these folks
will die, not tonight,

39:33.913 --> 39:35.824
not tomorrow,
maybe not for a long time.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.616
You and Alicia are safe.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.579
I'll sleep like a baby.

39:43.089 --> 39:45.171
Say Troy.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.877
It was.

39:46.926 --> 39:49.008
No one would believe us.

39:49.053 --> 39:52.090
They're more afraid of what's out
there than anything he could do.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.756
You should've told me first
before you did this.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.549
You would've said no.

39:56.603 --> 39:58.468
No. I get it.

39:58.521 --> 40:02.139
I hate it, I get it.

40:02.191 --> 40:05.149
I would have backed you
like I'm backing you now.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.522
Just don't forget
what he is.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.902
( cows mooing )
- ( men chattering )

40:25.423 --> 40:27.334
I didn't go out there
to do that, I swear.

40:31.346 --> 40:32.802
He owed me.

40:35.391 --> 40:38.975
He had to look me
directly in the eye.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.433
He had to say it to my face,
say it like Vernon said it to my father.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.229
He owed me that.

40:47.278 --> 40:49.439
He didn't want
to do that, did he?

40:54.243 --> 40:56.154
He said some things,
and...

40:56.204 --> 40:58.069
I did some things.

41:02.752 --> 41:04.242
Then it went bad.

41:11.427 --> 41:13.383
Not what you want
to hear, is it?

41:13.429 --> 41:15.590
You could run
this place, Troy,

41:15.640 --> 41:18.723
but not if you let things
break like that.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.635
Last night you had command.
I saw that.

41:21.688 --> 41:25.977
Your militia saw that,
and they responded.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.732
Your brother doesn't have
what you have.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.110
He's not of this place.

41:31.155 --> 41:35.068
You're the survivor.
You're the heir.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.574
So, no, the last thing
I want to hear

41:36.619 --> 41:38.075
is how you lost control.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.907
That can't happen.

41:39.956 --> 41:43.244
( music playing )

41:43.292 --> 41:45.032
I don't care
how you did it.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.500
I don't care
why you did it.

41:49.549 --> 41:52.882
All I care about
is that you can control it.

41:56.806 --> 42:00.469
There's a fight coming,
and you have to save us.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.803
Can you?

42:07.442 --> 42:09.854
Yes, ma'am.

42:09.902 --> 42:12.860
( music playing )

42:27.170 --> 42:30.162
( music playing )
