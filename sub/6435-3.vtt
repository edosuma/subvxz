WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:02.801
See, that's why I buy
quality garbage bags.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.503
See, they got the drawstring
on 'em, they don't rip.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.438
Yeah.
They cost a little extra money,
but it's worth it.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.322
A-rabs.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.857
Yeah.

00:29.329 --> 00:31.830
Yeah, where he learn how
to speak their language
like that, man?

00:31.832 --> 00:34.066
Look at that scarf that
nigga's wearing, man.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.200
Lloyd:
Yes.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.036
That's one of them
desert scarves.

00:37.038 --> 00:38.704
Wa alaikum as-salaam,
my brother.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.005
You thinking
what I'm thinking?
Yes,

00:40.007 --> 00:41.707
I'm thinking
what you're thinking!

00:41.709 --> 00:44.209
I think this nigga's
a terrorist, man.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.244
Yep.

01:15.442 --> 01:18.077
Lloyd:
<i>Oh, I can't believe it!</i>
<i>Al-qaeda in compton?</i>

01:18.079 --> 01:20.245
And where'd the nigga learn
how to speak their language?

01:20.247 --> 01:22.281
Think about it.
When's the last time you met

01:22.283 --> 01:24.416
A nigga from compton
knew how to speak terrorist?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.351
He... Speaking that terrorist.

01:26.353 --> 01:27.453
Blah blah-blah
blah blah-blah-blah.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.687
I heard it!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.422
You consort with terrorists,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.724
That makes you a terrorist.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.594
Jesus h. Christ,

01:35.596 --> 01:37.629
Radical muslim terrorist.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.432
So what we gonna do?
What we gonna do?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.701
You know, lloyd,

01:42.703 --> 01:45.104
There's three type of people
on the planet.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.738
The first type

01:46.740 --> 01:48.107
Is the sheep.

01:48.109 --> 01:49.475
Sheep is weak.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.110
Sheep need
to be led.

01:51.112 --> 01:54.313
Sheep believe that the
police can save them

01:54.315 --> 01:55.747
All the way up
until the moment

01:55.749 --> 01:57.716
They find out
that it's too late.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.651
Oh...
Yeah.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.286
And then there's
the second type.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.888
The wolf.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.124
The wolf preys
on the sheep.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.592
The wolf is evil.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.293
Evil wolf.

02:08.295 --> 02:09.561
This is deep.

02:09.563 --> 02:12.297
And then there's
the third type.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.599
The sheepdog.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.400
The sheepdog, lloyd.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.602
He ain't afraid of the wolf.

02:16.604 --> 02:17.803
The sheepdog

02:17.805 --> 02:19.972
Protects the sheep
from the wolf.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.274
The sheepdog don't
run from evil.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.642
He runs right up
on that shit

02:23.644 --> 02:25.277
And confronts it.

02:25.279 --> 02:26.645
Wow.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.614
Okay, okay.
Now who are we?

02:28.616 --> 02:29.848
(laughs)

02:29.850 --> 02:31.483
We're the sheepdog!

02:31.485 --> 02:32.651
Sheepdog?

02:32.653 --> 02:33.986
I thought we gonna
be the sheep.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.821
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm confused.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.022
We're the sheepdog.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.991
Okay? Okay,
listen, nigga,

02:38.993 --> 02:41.827
I'm gonna do it for you
one more time, all right?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.362
It's the sheepdog...
Sheepdog.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.596
...The wolf...
Wolf.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.831
...And the sheep.
And sheep.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.833
Jason:
Man, jesus, please tell me

02:47.835 --> 02:49.801
This ain't all
god got in store for me, man.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.837
Selling pallets
for six bucks a pop?

02:51.839 --> 02:54.173
I can say that's some
real loser shit, man.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.008
I should just get
back with dianne.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.143
I been telling
you that, jay.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.678
But that's something
both you and her

02:59.680 --> 03:01.180
Gonna have to get

03:01.182 --> 03:02.981
Yeah, but it's just
the whole cop thing, man.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.683
She's so hard-core with
that shit, I be feeling

03:04.685 --> 03:05.884
Like she gonna take me
to jail one day.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.152
Jesus:
Well, do you
love her, though?

03:07.154 --> 03:09.188
Jason:
Yeah, I love her
more than this.

03:09.190 --> 03:10.689
I mean, no offense--

03:10.691 --> 03:12.191
I'm just sayin'.
Hey.

03:12.193 --> 03:13.192
Jesus,

03:13.194 --> 03:14.560
You know,

03:14.562 --> 03:15.794
I'm getting woozy.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.196
This thing is...

03:17.198 --> 03:18.363
Jesus:
Trayvon.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.299
I had to carry my own cross.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.801
Do you know how heavy
those things is, man?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.169
Across one shoulder.

03:24.171 --> 03:25.837
Come on, man,
you'll be a'ight.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.573
(scoffs)
this dude.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.708
But for real, though, man,
just go and get back with her.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.043
That's the right
thing to do, jay.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.678
Pops been telling me, man.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.414
It been right here, the sign's
been right in your face.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.717
(jesus laughs)

03:38.719 --> 03:41.353
Amali, you gigantic playboy!

03:41.355 --> 03:42.688
<i>Allahu akbar.</i>

03:42.690 --> 03:43.889
(chuckling)

03:43.891 --> 03:45.824
(speaking arabic)

03:56.269 --> 03:57.736
<i>Hamdullah.</i>

03:57.738 --> 03:59.571
(speaking arabic)

03:59.573 --> 04:02.140
(lloyd singing to himself)

04:04.510 --> 04:07.079
Hey, lloyd, lloyd!
Come here, check, check...

04:07.081 --> 04:08.847
Come on, come on, check this
shit out, man. Check this out.

04:08.849 --> 04:13.619
"seven ways to spot
a terrorist."

04:13.621 --> 04:16.088
Number one:
Suspicious activity.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.723
Check.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.726
Number two: Illicit
fund-raising.

04:20.728 --> 04:21.960
Check.

04:21.962 --> 04:25.097
Number three:
Acquiring supplies

04:25.099 --> 04:28.533
And any other activity
deemed un-american.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.135
Check.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.436
You think all those pallets
they're collecting

04:31.438 --> 04:33.071
Is part of the plot?

04:33.073 --> 04:35.474
Look, lloyd, we don't know
what we don't know.

04:35.476 --> 04:36.742
I'm just saying,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.310
With all that wood
they collected,

04:38.312 --> 04:41.113
They probably chopped it all up,
pushed it together and made

04:41.115 --> 04:43.215
Some kind of
gigantic wood bomb.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.751
And when that bomb blow up,
boom!

04:45.753 --> 04:47.619
Shrapnel's everywhere.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.920
Death by splinters.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.455
We gotta call the authorities.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.657
Come on, I got it
right here.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.991
Hey, nigga,
hey, c...

04:52.993 --> 04:55.327
We ain't calling
nobody, man.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.063
Vic, you might be
a man of principle,

04:58.065 --> 05:00.799
But sometime, you gotta pick up
the phone and call white people.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.401
This is bigger than us.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.635
Lloyd,

05:03.637 --> 05:06.305
Nothing is bigger than us.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.639
Okay?

05:07.641 --> 05:10.942
We have to continue to watch.

05:10.944 --> 05:14.079
We gotta remain
vigilant.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.782
Keep collecting
evidence.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.450
We...

05:18.452 --> 05:19.818
Are the sheepdog.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.820
(phone ringing)

05:21.822 --> 05:23.655
Hello. It's dianne.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.157
Dianne, this is lloyd.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.158
Lloyd?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
Lloyd, vic's friend!

05:28.162 --> 05:29.328
The bum?

05:29.330 --> 05:30.495
Yes.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.331
Dianne, listen.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.433
You gotta do something.
We running out of time!

05:34.435 --> 05:36.935
Wait, okay, just calm down.
What are you talking about?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.438
Jesus is a terrorist.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.806
Wait, who's a terrorist?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.708
Jesus is a terrorist.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.276
Vic:
Lloyd!

05:44.278 --> 05:46.178
Hold on, vic, in the bathroom!

05:46.180 --> 05:48.013
What-- are you calling
from the bathroom?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.614
I'm hiding from vic

05:49.616 --> 05:51.783
Because he doesn't want me
to call the police.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.518
And I'm also taking a shit.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.820
(passes gas, grunts)

05:54.822 --> 05:56.021
That's just disgusting, lloyd!

05:56.023 --> 05:58.523
Look, this isn't funny,
all right?

05:58.525 --> 05:59.891
No, wait. Wait a minute!

05:59.893 --> 06:01.159
Bye. Just...

06:01.161 --> 06:02.728
They gonna kill people
with splinters!

06:02.730 --> 06:04.463
Splinters!
Lloyd!

06:04.465 --> 06:07.199
â™ª

06:08.534 --> 06:09.935
Perfect.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.477
Now, what the hell
does this mean?

06:18.479 --> 06:19.845
You illiterate, convict?

06:19.847 --> 06:21.880
The sign says,
"emergency..."

06:21.882 --> 06:24.082
Nigga, I can read,
but what does it mean?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.517
"emergency powers
in effect"?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.352
It means that
I got credible intel

06:27.354 --> 06:28.887
That there's a potential threat.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.088
And I'm gonna take

06:30.090 --> 06:31.423
All steps necessary

06:31.425 --> 06:33.392
To make sure
that it don't happen.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.227
Just better not be
using that as an excuse

06:35.229 --> 06:36.561
To run up in my crib
without notice.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.065
You just remember--
beware of sheepdogs.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.900
(bleep) does that even mean?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.402
Just what it mean, convict.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.470
Beware of sheepdog.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.540
(bleep) weirdo.
Oh, yeah.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.243
I'm changing all the fire
alarms in every unit today.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.578
I'm-a be up in yours

Mmm.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.786
Vic: See what
I mean, lloyd?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.121
Informed the nigga
of his rights,

07:03.123 --> 07:07.426
Plus got permission from
him to enter the unit.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.530
â™ª

07:25.478 --> 07:28.380
Jesus:
Come on, man, a few splinters
ain't never killed nobody.

07:28.382 --> 07:30.615
It ain't but five pallets,
man, and we on.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.950
For five hours?

07:31.952 --> 07:33.151
Split five ways?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.419
This is
stupid, man.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.787
We're not making
no money,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.489

07:40.294 --> 07:42.160

07:42.162 --> 07:43.628
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop, stop.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.030
Back up, back up, back up.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.367
(snickers)

07:54.240 --> 07:56.608
Oh, my god.
(laughing)

07:56.610 --> 07:58.176
Man, we got to pray to god

07:58.178 --> 08:00.178
And thank him for his wonderful
generosity, man. Yes!

08:00.180 --> 08:01.780
Hey, man, we can pray later,
but right now,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.849
Let's get these pallets
and get the (bleep) out of here.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.750
H-h-h-hey! Stop,

08:05.752 --> 08:08.320
Put that down.
Look, frank, man,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.756
You know y'all finna

08:11.758 --> 08:13.959
Let us have 'em; we'll get
rid of 'em, no charge.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.360
No, you think you're
the only ones

08:15.362 --> 08:17.195
Who have been trying to
do this pallet hustle?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.763
No, and (bleep) off.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.332
We're not throwing them away.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.334
Hey, man, you can let us
have these pallets,

08:22.336 --> 08:24.035
You nigerian
michelin man.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.971
And you the same color
as your uniform!

08:25.973 --> 08:27.672
I don't want to see
you here again!

08:27.674 --> 08:30.509
Put it down!

08:30.511 --> 08:32.944
Really gonna act

08:32.946 --> 08:34.613
Go somewhere!

08:34.615 --> 08:37.649
So now y'all see

08:37.651 --> 08:39.851
We just go snatch them pallets,
throw 'em in a car

08:39.853 --> 08:41.152
And smash the (bleep) out.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.521
That's stealing, fish.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.189
Come on, man,

08:44.191 --> 08:45.490
What pops say, man?

08:45.492 --> 08:47.459
"thou shall not steal."
"shall not steal."

08:47.461 --> 08:49.361
I know, man, but this
is not stealing.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.796
It's just pieces of wood.
Nah, man.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.665
We can't do it, man.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.600
It ain't poppin'.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.403
No more janky shit, brah.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.411
You know I love you,
though, right?

09:12.919 --> 09:14.219
Jesus say he love us, right?

09:14.221 --> 09:15.554
And I know
we love him, too, man,

09:15.556 --> 09:17.222
But I'm trying to get
this money.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.323
Let's go snatch them pallets.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.391
That's what I'm saying, man.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.559
We split that three ways.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.594
That's, what,
$80 apiece.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.563
And that's good money
for some trash-ass pallets.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.731
Yeah, the only thing is
they got cameras in the front,

09:26.733 --> 09:28.266
Cameras in the back,--
there's cameras everywhere.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.401
We can wear a mask.

09:29.403 --> 09:30.769
Yeah, but if we
wear a mask,

09:30.771 --> 09:31.870
The police gonna
see us coming.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.338
(snaps)
burkas.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.606
How about
we wear burkas?

09:34.608 --> 09:35.740
Wh-what's a burka?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.509
It's them joints
the muslim women wear

09:37.511 --> 09:39.177
That cover them
from head to toe.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.779
We just three innocent
muslim women.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.248
Hey, man, I ain't wearing
no (bleep) dress.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.183
Nigga, your lord and savior
wears a dress.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.852
And he ain't got
no bitches, do he?

09:47.854 --> 09:49.087
Niggas, y'all with it or what?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.355
I'm with it.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.457
Look, man, I'm with it, man,

09:52.459 --> 09:54.659
But I'm not wearing
no (bleep) dress.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.923
"ways to spot a terrorist.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.826
"number four: Test security.

10:27.828 --> 10:31.396
Number five: Rehearsal."

10:31.398 --> 10:33.131
I seen that myself.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.300
They was casing
that grocery store.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.568
That's probably the plan.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.236
Blow up the grocery store

10:38.238 --> 10:40.605
So people would be afraid
to buy groceries.

10:40.607 --> 10:41.640
But that's crazy.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.641
That's absolutely insane.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.142
And I know crazy.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.110
Bam.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.445
This could cripple
the economy, man.

10:47.447 --> 10:50.849
And they say that "once they've
already surveilled a target,

10:50.851 --> 10:53.652
Terrorist activity is imminent."

10:53.654 --> 10:55.186
There you go again.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.655
Down that rabbit hole.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.089
We in too deep, vic.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.025
Hey, listen, man,
we ain't in too deep.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.827
We are the sheepdog, lloyd.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.162
We got to handle
this shit.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.631
But, vic,
we're not cops.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.466
We have no authority
to stop them.

11:08.468 --> 11:12.003
(scoffs) lloyd, you forgetting
that I used to be in the navy.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.139
But, vic, we
not on a boat!

11:14.141 --> 11:16.808
I swore an oath
to protect this nation

11:16.810 --> 11:19.811
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

11:19.813 --> 11:21.813
(knocking on door)

11:21.815 --> 11:24.015
And on land, too.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.918
Who the (bleep) is that?!

11:29.021 --> 11:31.189
Spike, the
demolition man!

11:31.191 --> 11:32.023
Yeah, baby!

11:32.025 --> 11:33.191
Ah!
Good to see you.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.893
(spike laughs)

11:35.695 --> 11:37.028
(grunts)
yeah.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.330
Got something for you,
gonna hook you up.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.832
That's what's up.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.667
Came to the
right man, baby.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.203
Vic, I got to go.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.538
Ugh.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.306
Lord, have mercy.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.711
Spike:
Who was that?

11:52.713 --> 11:54.212
Uh, just a
local bum, man.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.014
You know, he comes around
and picks up cans.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.982
Excuse the funk.
Damn, he stinks.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.819
Vic: What you got for me, brah?
Spike: Let me show you
what I got for you.

12:04.757 --> 12:06.391
This right here--

12:06.393 --> 12:08.259
Military-issue mace.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.395
Accurate
within 15 feet.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.396
(imitates spray)

12:11.398 --> 12:12.731
One spray of that (bleep). Aah!

12:12.733 --> 12:15.667
Burn the (bleep)
out of al-qaeda's eyes.

12:15.669 --> 12:18.169
Brought you
four cans, baby.

12:20.506 --> 12:22.507
C-90 stun gun.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.442
Baddest gun in the game, baby.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.910
Easy to use,

12:25.912 --> 12:27.779
Easy to charge
with a cigarette lighter.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.881
You can fend off
multiple attackers

12:29.883 --> 12:31.216
With this thing right here.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.751
When them isis fools
run up on you...

12:32.753 --> 12:34.085
(imitates stun gun)

12:34.087 --> 12:36.588
Night-night, isis,
night-night.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.790
(laughs)

12:40.259 --> 12:41.760
These right here

12:41.762 --> 12:43.595
Are tear gas grenades.

12:43.597 --> 12:48.433
This is the same shit they used
on them niggas in ferguson.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.469
You saw how them niggas' eyes
was popping out their head,

12:51.471 --> 12:52.804
Burning like this...

12:52.806 --> 12:54.372
And just sliming at the mouth.

12:54.374 --> 12:55.774
Real deal.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.776
Mm-hmm, and what I did,

12:57.778 --> 13:01.045
I'm throwing in
an emergency flare gun.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.282
(imitates flare
being fired)

13:04.284 --> 13:06.117
Point it right at 'em...
(shouts indistinctly)

13:06.119 --> 13:07.385
Gone.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.620
That's gonna do nicely.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.456
And on top of that,
check this out.

13:11.458 --> 13:16.161
I'm throwing in two seal-grade
tactical bulletproof vests.

13:16.163 --> 13:17.395
Check it out.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.363
Put it on, homie.

13:19.565 --> 13:21.566
(laughs excitedly)

13:21.568 --> 13:22.901
You look good
in that thing, boy.

13:22.903 --> 13:24.402
Look like you
back in the day.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.737
Check it out, boy.

13:25.739 --> 13:26.805
(chuckles)

13:26.807 --> 13:27.972
I got something for you.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.974
Put this hat on
with it, playboy.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.976
Boy, you look like
an ebony model, boy.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.912
You gonna be a'ight.
Oh, man.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.446
Come on, baby.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.681
(laughs)

13:36.683 --> 13:39.017
I didn't know
who else to call.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.351
Are you sure you
weren't followed?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.921
(scoffs)
I'm off duty tonight, lloyd.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.189
Look, I don't like
jesus, either,

13:44.191 --> 13:45.690
But I doubt he's a terrorist.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.258
I don't know what to do.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.259
I need a drink.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.828
(sighs)

13:49.830 --> 13:51.496
Lloyd, what are you do...?
Put that away.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.031
What are...? Oh, my...

13:53.033 --> 13:55.967
I've told vic ten times
to call homeland security.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.603
Well, do not do that.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.637
He's crazy!

13:59.639 --> 14:02.507
Talking about sheepdogs

14:02.509 --> 14:04.976
And wolf dogs and coyotes.

14:04.978 --> 14:07.846
Just relax
and-and tell vic to relax.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.848
If you want, you know, I...

14:09.850 --> 14:11.716
I could talk to jason about it.

14:11.718 --> 14:13.818
Yeah? Promise?

14:13.820 --> 14:15.019
(chuckles)
I promise.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.354
Don't tell vic.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.689
I won't tell vic.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.524
So, um, have you

14:19.526 --> 14:21.559
Seen him around lately-- jason?

14:21.561 --> 14:22.827
I see him every day!

14:22.829 --> 14:24.395
He live in that
truck with jesus.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.564
Bald-headed freak--
I don't understand it.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.699
Yeah, me neither.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.133
Poor thing.

14:29.135 --> 14:32.203
That damn jesus christ
ruined a lot of lives.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.339
You know, I've tried
to move on, lloyd.

14:34.341 --> 14:36.541
But all I keep meeting
are assholes.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.543
Let me give you some advice
about relationships.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.544
(sighs)

14:39.546 --> 14:40.545
Drink.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.980
Oh, it's my day off,

14:41.982 --> 14:44.215
And I'm sitting here
drinking with a bum.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.984
It's officially
loser status, huh?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.252
To losers.
To losers.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.920
(laughs)
come on, baby, kill it!

14:48.922 --> 14:50.088
(laughs, grunts)

14:50.090 --> 14:52.156
Kill it.
Kill it, babe.

14:52.158 --> 14:53.691
Mm-hmm.
Kill that!

14:53.693 --> 14:54.726
There you go.
(grunts)

14:54.728 --> 14:56.594
(grunting)

14:56.596 --> 14:59.097
(whoops, laughs)

14:59.099 --> 15:00.598
Ooh!

15:00.600 --> 15:02.901
Yeah...
I'm not feeling good.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.669
Why not?
Like I have to...

15:04.671 --> 15:05.837
You all right?

15:05.839 --> 15:07.005
(coughing)
babe! Babe!

15:07.007 --> 15:08.573
Sugar dumpling!

15:10.342 --> 15:12.176
(retching)

15:12.178 --> 15:13.745
Let it all out.
Let it all out.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.213
Yeah, there you go.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.582
I got you.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.118
(distant coughing)
lloyd:
Yeah, there you go.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.620
(dianne continues coughing)

15:22.622 --> 15:24.756
Dianne:
Oh, my god!

15:24.758 --> 15:26.925
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever had!

15:26.927 --> 15:28.593
Mmm! Mmm! There you go.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.295
Oh, lloyd.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.429
(coughing)

15:31.431 --> 15:33.431
Lloyd:
You good. Yeah,
it gonna make you gag.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.967
Dianne:
Ooh, lloyd. Ooh.
Lloyd: Mm-hmm.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.736
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
(coughing)

15:38.738 --> 15:42.774
(dianne retching)

15:42.776 --> 15:44.475
Oh, boy. Mmm. Mmm.
Oh, god.

15:44.477 --> 15:45.810
Yeah.
(mumbling)

15:45.812 --> 15:48.146
Lloyd:
Mmm! Mmm!

15:48.148 --> 15:51.316
(dianne groans,
lloyd grunts)

15:51.318 --> 15:53.384
We come from around
the pallet side.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.720
Then, got the alley...
Wait, wait, wait.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.122
Who the... Who the x?
You the x?
I'm the x.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.724
Fish: I'm the x.
Jason: All right.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.592
Fish: Don't know why your
pallet's square, man.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.894
Pallet's not square.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.295
(overlapping chatter)

16:04.297 --> 16:06.564
Hey, hey, jay, look, I got
some bad news for you, man.

16:06.566 --> 16:07.799
Yeah, what's up?

16:07.801 --> 16:10.568
I just saw dianne
blowing lloyd on the sidewalk

16:10.570 --> 16:12.103
By the liquor store.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.238
Man, stop playing.
We're trying to get

16:14.240 --> 16:15.473
This plan together.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.507
What?
Hey, man,

16:16.509 --> 16:17.809
It's no joke. I'm for real.

16:17.811 --> 16:18.910
She was excited.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.979
Doing the whole two-hand thing.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.647
You know... Oh, oh.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.649
Oh, oh.
Oh.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.750
Man, she was amazing.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.819
She was giving lloyd fellatio

16:27.821 --> 16:29.854
In public with no shame.

16:29.856 --> 16:32.657
Hold on, hold on.
Dianne and lloyd?

16:32.659 --> 16:33.992
You sure it was dianne?

16:33.994 --> 16:35.660
I hate to show this to you,

16:35.662 --> 16:37.128
But bam, right there.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.998
That's dianne,
that's lloyd,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.001
And that's the alley
by the liquor store.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.869
She ain't even need
no knee pad.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.671
Hey, um, jay...

16:46.673 --> 16:48.840
Boonie:
I-I was thinking
about it the whole time, man.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.208
It's got to be blackmail.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.776
Lloyd got some dirt on her,

16:51.778 --> 16:53.611
Now she got to be his sex slave.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.981
No, man,
god cannot hate me this much.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.516
Hey, man, I know
that's your girl, man.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.951
I'm sorry that happened, man.

16:59.953 --> 17:01.285
That's why I date shalinka, man.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.687
I ain't got to worry

17:02.689 --> 17:06.190
About nobody letting her
suck their (bleep) but me.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.560
But anyway, I got the burkas
out here, man.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.763
Y'all want to come
check 'em out?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.067
Boonie:
Hey, man, what do I look like?

17:16.069 --> 17:18.870
Like the fat black ghost
from pac-man.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.204
Boonie:
Hey, man.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.706
Fish:
Come on, y'all, let's go.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.709
Oh, shit!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.412
Pick up the phone, lloyd.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.048
Come on, pick up the phone,
you bum-ass nigga.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.416
Lloyd:
Hey, vic.
Lloyd. Lloyd, look,

17:31.418 --> 17:33.217
Look, it's going down right now.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.585
They on the move, man.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.487
Look, man, they out there
right now,

17:36.489 --> 17:39.223
And they're dressed up
like bitches, man.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.526
They got dresses on, lloyd.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.495
This is number six--
impersonation!

17:44.497 --> 17:47.098
And they're about to go
to number seven, I can tell!

17:47.100 --> 17:48.433
Number seven?!

17:48.435 --> 17:50.568
Yes, lloyd, number seven--
deployment!

18:05.050 --> 18:07.652
(crickets chirping)

18:16.195 --> 18:17.628
Hey, let's go.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.197
All right, we got
90 seconds to do this.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.565
Let's go.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.034
All right, a little more,
little more.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.902
Little more,
little more.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.537
Okay, okay,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.139
No bullshit, boonie.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.042
Get your ass up, man. Come on.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.745
Come on, come on,
hurry up!

18:34.747 --> 18:36.614
In the name

18:36.616 --> 18:39.117
Of the united
states government,

18:39.119 --> 18:40.885
Freeze, (bleep)!

18:40.887 --> 18:42.053
Is that vic?

18:42.055 --> 18:43.788
Man, that nigga's
shooting at us.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.957
United states navy!

18:45.959 --> 18:47.592
Aah!

18:47.594 --> 18:50.561
Get back in there!
Let's move, y'all! Let's go!

18:52.231 --> 18:54.932
Hey, be cool, be cool.

18:54.934 --> 18:58.569
Act like there's money
on your debit card.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.241
Vic: Where you niggas at?
Whoa! Hey!
Get up out of here!

19:03.243 --> 19:05.810
Vic:
Stop! And then freeze!

19:05.812 --> 19:07.078
I'm coming, man.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.679
I'm coming.
(screaming)

19:08.681 --> 19:10.781
I'm gonna kill my mama, man.
Watch out, jay. Watch out, man.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.316
Eat that, bitch! Eat it!
Get down! Get down! Get down!

19:12.318 --> 19:13.317
What's wrong with you, bitch?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.986
Crazy (bleep).
Come on!

19:14.988 --> 19:17.088
Boonie, watch your back!
How dare you betray
your country!

19:17.090 --> 19:19.824
Woman (over p.A.):
Security to produce.
Vic, have you lost your mind?!

19:19.826 --> 19:21.926
White people in this store.
White lives matter!

19:21.928 --> 19:24.829
What are you...?
(yelling)

19:24.831 --> 19:26.597
(groaning)

19:26.599 --> 19:28.799
Damn cheap-ass bitch.
Yeah, that's right.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.168
Cheap ass.
Oh, man.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.669
What you want,
patent leather face?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.137
(grunting)
let's get it on! Yeah!

19:33.139 --> 19:34.839
It's the one thing.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.508
You can't hit my face!
(overlapping chatter)

19:37.510 --> 19:38.976
Jesus!

19:38.978 --> 19:41.279
What the (bleep), man?!
Time out!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.614
That's jesus, man.
I was on that
high-ass cross for this?!

19:43.616 --> 19:45.116
Let's get out of here, jay.
Come on.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.517
Stop this foolishness!

19:46.519 --> 19:48.319
Pardon me for my cussing,
but, look, man,

19:48.321 --> 19:49.720
You're (bleep) up right now!

19:49.722 --> 19:51.055
(siren blaring)

19:51.057 --> 19:52.990
They got to be here.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.458
Stay here, lloyd.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.296
(grunting)

19:58.298 --> 20:00.865
Stop resisting!

20:00.867 --> 20:02.300
Stop resisting arrest!

20:02.302 --> 20:04.769
Dianne?
Jason?!

20:07.239 --> 20:09.407
(sighs)
hey, baby.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.209
Oh.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.544
(siren blaring,
dianne laughing)

20:13.546 --> 20:15.379
You guys are so
lucky the manager's

20:15.381 --> 20:17.215
Not pressing any charges.

20:17.217 --> 20:19.083
Vic, if you thought
something was going down,

20:19.085 --> 20:20.418
Why didn't you call
the police?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.720
I think somebody did try
to call the police.

20:22.722 --> 20:27.058
And what's gonna happen to
the con man and his crew?
Dianne: What's gonna happen?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.560
Nothing.
They're terrorists.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.062
They're losers, vic.
But...

20:31.064 --> 20:32.263
They were just
stealing pallets.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.497
It's over.
But...

20:33.499 --> 20:34.732
Vic, look,
you're the dumb one here.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.901
Okay? You could have gone
to jail tonight.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.403
Just go home, relax.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.239
(chuckles)

20:41.241 --> 20:44.508
So, I heard, uh,
you're a terrorist.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.911
I heard you gave lloyd head
in the parking lot.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.679
What?! No, I didn't!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.181
Come on, baby
girl, don't lie.

20:50.183 --> 20:53.684
I got it all
on video.
Oh, okay.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.254
I know what that
looks like.
Why you call the cops, lloyd?

20:56.256 --> 20:59.090
I was frightened.
I was scared for my country.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.558
I was scared for you, vic.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.027
Guess everybody
can't be sheepdogs.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.363
(chuckles) I heard that.

21:05.365 --> 21:08.366
(dianne coughing
and retching on video)

21:08.368 --> 21:10.134
As-salaam alaikum, vic.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.303
Get your hands out
of my face, man.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.572
Beware of the
sheepdog, (bleep).

21:14.574 --> 21:16.774
Fish, your rent
is due on Tuesday.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.876
What happened today
don't change nothing.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.046
Hey, vic, you look like
a crackhead baked potato

21:22.048 --> 21:24.081
That got burnt.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.283
(laughter)

21:25.285 --> 21:27.084
You done.
You bad.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.686
