WEBVTT

00:40.100 --> 00:42.900
ERIC, DON'T THINK
I DON'T APPRECIATE
A GOOD T-BONE,

00:42.900 --> 00:44.667
BUT I WOULD'VE BEEN
PLENTY HAPPY

00:44.667 --> 00:46.467
WITH A DOUBLE
CHUBBIE BURGER.

00:46.467 --> 00:49.100
HE GETS STEAK. I GET
COLD GRILLED CHEESE.

00:49.100 --> 00:50.200
WHAT GIVES?

00:50.200 --> 00:52.233
MORGAN, I JUST FEEL
THAT OUR BROTHER,

00:52.233 --> 00:53.600
WITH HIS INTERESTING
LIFE,

00:53.600 --> 00:54.800
HE DESERVES
A HEARTY MEAL.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.600
YOU DON'T THINK
MY LIFE'S INTERESTING?

00:56.600 --> 00:59.033
MORGAN, DID I JUST
DO SOMETHING NICE
FOR CORY?

00:59.033 --> 01:00.066
YEAH.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.934
DO I NORMALLY
DO NICE STUFF
FOR CORY?

01:01.934 --> 01:02.934
NO.

01:02.934 --> 01:04.400
WHY WOULD I DO
NICE STUFF FOR CORY?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.734
BECAUSE SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENED
TO HIM.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.033
EAT YOUR
GRILLED CHEESE.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.467
SO I WOULD BE CORRECT
IN ASSUMING THAT...

01:13.467 --> 01:15.834
THIS WONDERFUL MEAL
IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THOSE

01:15.834 --> 01:18.567
CONDEMNED-MAN, DEATH-ROW,
LAST-MEAL KIND OF THINGS.

01:18.567 --> 01:20.467
BUT THAT CAN'T BE,

01:20.467 --> 01:22.767
BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAKE.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.400
DEAD MAN WALKING.

01:28.934 --> 01:30.834
SHOULD WE DO THIS
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

01:31.700 --> 01:32.700
WE COULD DO IT THERE.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.767
I'M ONLY TELLING YOU THIS
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BROTHER,

01:36.767 --> 01:38.100
AND IT'S
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.467
BIG BUILDUP.
BAD, BAD, BAD.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.600
DON'T TELL ME.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.500
NO, CORY,
I THINK YOU GOTTA
HEAR THIS ONE.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.000
ALL RIGHT, THEN TELL ME.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.133
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH SHAWN
OR TOPANGA,

01:47.133 --> 01:48.300
I SHOULD BE OK.

01:50.033 --> 01:51.467
OK, UM...

01:51.467 --> 01:53.100
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
THE EXPRESSION...

01:53.100 --> 01:55.500
[IMITATING JAPANESE]

01:56.834 --> 01:58.100
[GRUNTING]

02:01.133 --> 02:03.600
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
HAVE MY ATTENTION.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.834
COR, I SAW SHAWN
AT CHUBBIE'S.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.734
HE WAS THERE
WITH TOPANGA.

02:08.734 --> 02:10.000
SHE SEEMED UPSET.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.300
UH...

02:11.300 --> 02:13.400
THEY WERE HUGGING,
AND HE KISSED HER.
WHAT?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.467
HE KISSED HER.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
WHAT?

02:18.400 --> 02:19.467
NOTHING HAPPENED AT ALL.

02:19.467 --> 02:21.600
OHH.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.767
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY
I LOVE TELLING YOU
BAD STUFF,

02:23.767 --> 02:25.000
BUT THIS ONE'S
KILLING ME.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.567
PICK UP THE PHONE,
SHAWN.

02:26.567 --> 02:27.734
ARE YOU THERE?

02:27.734 --> 02:29.600
PICK UP THE PHONE.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.934
COR, I KNOW HOW UPSET
YOU MUST BE.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.500
ERIC, LISTEN,
NOTHING HAPPENED
AT ALL, RIGHT?

02:34.500 --> 02:36.300
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.867
TOPANGA, IT'S ME.
ARE YOU THERE?

02:37.867 --> 02:39.800
IT'S 7:00.
PICK UP THE PHONE.

02:39.800 --> 02:43.000
WHERE ARE YOU?

02:48.100 --> 02:49.500
I HAD TO TELL YOU,
RIGHT?

02:49.500 --> 02:51.367
YOU UNDERSTAND
I HAD TO TELL YOU
WHAT I SAW?

02:52.300 --> 02:54.233
LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE MY OLDER
BROTHER, OK?

02:54.233 --> 02:57.200
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO LET ANYTHING BAD
HAPPEN TO ME.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.200
HOW COULD YOU LET THIS
HAPPEN TO ME?

02:59.767 --> 03:01.734
OK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

03:01.734 --> 03:04.800
AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT
GONNA KICK YOUR BUTT.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.300
YOU SAW HIM KISS HER?

03:07.133 --> 03:08.467
I DID.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.967
THEN MY BUTT'S KICKED
ANYWAY.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.000
SHAWN.

03:23.567 --> 03:24.900
HI.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.200
TOPANGA.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.000
HI.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
THE BOTH OF YOU.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.500
HI.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.300
TOPANGA, I NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.

03:36.300 --> 03:38.600
I CAN'T. I HAVE FEENY'S
HISTORY CLASS.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.300
NO, YOU DON'T.
YOU HAVE LUNCH NOW.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.900
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
CALL ME BACK LAST NIGHT?

03:43.900 --> 03:45.300
IT WAS REALLY LATE.

03:45.300 --> 03:46.500
IT WAS 7:00.

03:48.300 --> 03:49.467
CORY, I HAVE
HISTORY NOW.

03:49.467 --> 03:51.900
WHAT? I--WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:51.900 --> 03:52.900
I HAVE HISTORY NOW.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.233
YOU HAVE LUNCH NOW,
WITH ME.

03:55.233 --> 03:57.500
YOU LET<i>HER </i>GO.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.100
OK. OK, BUT I ONLY GOT
LIKE A MINUTE OR TWO.

04:00.100 --> 04:03.300
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I AM GONNA BE ABSOLUTELY
MATURE ABOUT THIS.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.800
KNOCK, KNOCK.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.100
WHO'S THERE?

04:09.100 --> 04:11.400
YOU AND TOPANGA,
TOGETHER AT CHUBBIE'S
LAST NIGHT.

04:11.400 --> 04:12.767
ERIC SAW YOU.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.600
YOU-AND-TOPANGA,
TOGETHER-AT-CHUBBIE'S
LAST-NIGHT,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.767
ERIC-SAW-YOU...

04:17.767 --> 04:19.467
WHO?

04:21.200 --> 04:23.400
WERE YOU AT CHUBBIE'S
LAST NIGHT?

04:23.400 --> 04:25.500
ERIC HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE SAW.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.133
WERE YOU AT CHUBBIE'S
LAST NIGHT?
YES.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.734
YES.
WERE YOU THERE
WITH TOPANGA?

04:28.734 --> 04:30.800
I'LL BE LOOKING FOR A NO
ON THIS NEXT QUESTION. GOT IT?

04:30.800 --> 04:31.800
YES.
NO.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.600
DID YOU KISS HER?
YES.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
NO!

04:34.600 --> 04:36.233
Y-YOU KISSED HER?

04:36.233 --> 04:37.567
CORY, IT WAS
NO BIG DEAL, OK?

04:37.567 --> 04:39.934
TOPANGA GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH HER PARENTS.

04:39.934 --> 04:40.934
SHE WAS REAL EMOTIONAL,

04:40.934 --> 04:42.400
AND I HAPPENED
TO BE THERE,

04:42.400 --> 04:43.500
SO I GAVE HER A HUG,

04:43.500 --> 04:46.834
AND YES, I GAVE HER
AN INNOCENT KISS.

04:46.834 --> 04:47.934
INNOCENT.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.734
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

04:49.734 --> 04:52.233
AND YOU KNOW
THAT I TELL YOU
EVERYTHING.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.600
YEAH, BUT HOW COME
SHE DIDN'T COME TO ME?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.100
SHE WILL.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.867
WE JUST HAPPENED TO RUN
INTO EACH OTHER FIRST,
THAT'S ALL.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.734
OK, WELL, I GUESS
I FEEL BETTER THEN.

05:02.734 --> 05:04.100
TOPANGA LOVES YOU.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.100
YOU BROTHER'S GOT YOU
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.

05:06.100 --> 05:09.200
TELL HIM TO BACK OFF.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.000
EXCUSE ME.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.567
AND SHAWN'S
MY BEST FRIEND,

05:12.567 --> 05:13.967
AND TOPANGA
LOVES ME, OK?

05:13.967 --> 05:15.700
AND IT TAKES
A PRETTY TWISTED SIBLING

05:15.700 --> 05:17.100
TO THINK
THAT THEY WOULD EVER
ENTERTAIN THE THOUGHT

05:17.100 --> 05:19.000
OF SNEAKING AROUND
BEHIND MY BACK.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
SHAWN WAS RIGHT
ABOUT YOU--SEEING WHAT
YOU DON'T SEE,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.100
JUMPING
TO CONCLUSIONS.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.467
YOU ARE MY BROTHER,
ERIC.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.667
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO PROTECT ME.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.000
EXCUSE ME.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.200
HI. HEY, ERIC.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.000
E-ERIC?
LEAVE ME ALONE.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.900
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.934
YEAH? YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO SOMETHING
THAT CAUSES CORY PAIN,

05:35.934 --> 05:37.100
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET PAIN BACK?

05:37.100 --> 05:38.300
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOIN' ON.

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
ERIC! ERIC, LISTEN,
LET HIM GO, OK?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.367
I'VE THOUGHT THIS OUT.

05:41.367 --> 05:42.967
I'VE REACHED
MY OWN CONCLUSION...

05:42.967 --> 05:46.100
AND MY OWN CONCLUSION
IS THAT SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENED.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.233
SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED,
DIDN'T IT?

05:48.233 --> 05:49.467
YEAH, IT DID.

05:49.467 --> 05:50.900
THEN TELL ME.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.133
I CAN'T, OK?

05:52.133 --> 05:54.767
YOU JUST GOTTA TALK
TO TOPANGA.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:24.767 --> 06:26.500
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

06:26.500 --> 06:29.567
I WANTED TO BE
THE LAST ONE TO KISS YOU
BEFORE I KILL YOU.

06:31.667 --> 06:33.400
CORY...

06:33.400 --> 06:35.967
TOPANGA,
MY FAVORITE PART
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP

06:35.967 --> 06:37.300
IS THAT...

06:37.300 --> 06:40.367
WE--WE'VE ALWAYS
BEEN ABLE TO TALK
TO EACH OTHER...

06:40.367 --> 06:41.700
ABOUT ANYTHING.

06:43.233 --> 06:46.300
SO I WANT YOU
TO TALK TO ME.

06:52.767 --> 06:55.200
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

06:55.200 --> 06:58.834
I WANTED TO BE
THE LAST ONE TO KISS YOU
BEFORE I KILL YOU.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.500
THIS IS REALLY BAD, HUH?

07:09.567 --> 07:11.000
CORY, LOOK...

07:12.300 --> 07:14.400
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,

07:14.400 --> 07:17.400
AND YOU ALWAYS
HAVE BEEN.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.800
AND MORE.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.200
AND I KNOW HOW YOUNG
AND STUPID THIS IS,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.300
BUT I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED
THAT WE'D BE TOGETHER
FOR THE REST OF LIVES.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.400
STOP TIME.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.900
WHAT?

07:27.900 --> 07:29.800
I WANT TO CALL
"STOP TIME" NOW.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.100
I WANT TO STOP TIME

07:32.100 --> 07:33.200
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
IF YOU KEEP ON GOING,

07:33.200 --> 07:34.500
THEN YOU'RE GONNA GET
TO THE BAD PART.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.133
BUT I KNOW
THAT IF WE STOP TIME,

07:37.133 --> 07:41.000
THEN WE'RE GONNA BE
TOGETHER FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.500
HEY, I--I CALLED
A STOP TIME.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.000
YOU--YOU CAN'T CRY.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.967
NOTHING HAPPENS
DURING STOP TIME.

07:56.667 --> 07:58.300
WE'RE JUST TOGETHER.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.400
[SNIFFLES]

08:01.900 --> 08:04.100
PLEASE, DON'T CRY.

08:09.100 --> 08:13.300
HOW COME THERE'S SO MANY
BOXES IN YOUR ROOM?

08:15.734 --> 08:17.734
CORY...

08:22.900 --> 08:25.667
MY FAMILY AND I...

08:27.000 --> 08:28.834
ARE MOVING.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.133
TO A DIFFERENT HOUSE

08:33.133 --> 08:35.567
ON THE SAME BLOCK
YOU LIVE ON NOW?

08:38.467 --> 08:40.600
WE'RE LEAVING
PHILADELPHIA.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.233
WE'RE MOVING
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.467
THERE'S NO WAY
OUT OF THIS.

08:57.467 --> 08:58.700
MY MOM WAS TRANSFERRED
TO PITTSBURGH,

08:58.700 --> 09:00.100
AND THEY NEED HER
RIGHT AWAY.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.667
CORY, YOU HAVE TO SAY
SOMETHING.

09:09.367 --> 09:10.600
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN PITTSBURGH.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.567
I BELIEVE IN US.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.967
I MEAN, I DON'T CARE
IF I HAVE TO WALK
TO PITTSBURGH.

09:18.967 --> 09:20.600
NOTHING'S GONNA
COME BETWEEN US,
ALL RIGHT?

09:20.600 --> 09:21.600
WE'RE GONNA BE
TOGETHER

09:21.600 --> 09:22.967
FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.200
OK...

09:28.200 --> 09:30.000
SO THERE...

09:30.000 --> 09:32.567
I'M AS YOUNG
AND STUPID AS YOU.

09:32.567 --> 09:36.600
I'M SORRY I WAS AFRAID
TO TALK TO YOU.

09:36.600 --> 09:38.233
AND HERE YOU ARE,
TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL BETTER.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.934
CORY, WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN?

09:47.467 --> 09:48.500
NOTHING.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.734
LOOK,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
IS THAT THIS IS A...

09:53.734 --> 09:55.800
SIMPLE TEST
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.500
A SIMPLE...

09:57.500 --> 09:59.200
PIECE-OF-CAKE TEST

09:59.200 --> 10:01.300
FOR A RELATIONSHIP
AS SOLID AS OURS.

10:03.100 --> 10:04.934
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:04.934 --> 10:08.033
IF TWO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT
EACH OTHER AS MUCH AS WE DO
CAN'T HOLD IT TOGETHER,

10:08.033 --> 10:09.767
THEN THERE'S NO HOPE
FOR ANYONE.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.367
NO. IT'S GONNA TAKE
SOMETHING A LOT BIGGER
THAN PITTSBURGH

10:14.367 --> 10:15.667
TO BREAK US APART.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.200
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?

10:24.200 --> 10:27.467
I WANTED TO BE
THE LAST ONE TO KISS YOU
BEFORE I KISS YOU AGAIN.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.000
CORY, HONEY, I KNOW HOW HARD
THIS MUST SEEM RIGHT NOW,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.500
BUT SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO
BELIEVE THAT THINGS
HAPPEN FOR A REASON

10:40.500 --> 10:42.867
AND THAT LIFE WORKS OUT
FOR THE BEST.

10:42.867 --> 10:45.500
MOM, LISTEN, EVERYTHING'S
GONNA WORK OUT.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.233
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW
HOW CLOSE

10:47.233 --> 10:50.500
PHILADELPHIA
AND PITTSBURGH
ACTUALLY ARE?

10:50.500 --> 10:52.000
IT'S VERY EASY.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.867
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF REARRANGING
SOME SCHEDULES.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.900
NO, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE
HARDER THAN YOU REALIZE.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.300
AMY, CORY'S TRYING
VERY HARD.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.734
WHY DO WE HAVE TO...

11:01.734 --> 11:05.233
BECAUSE, ALAN,
IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER
THAN HE REALIZES,

11:05.233 --> 11:06.900
AND I THINK HE NEEDS
TO KNOW THAT.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.233
MOM, LISTEN,
TOPANGA AND I HAVE
TALKED ABOUT THIS, OK?

11:10.233 --> 11:13.967
IF WE BELIEVE
WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK,
WHY WOULD YOU DOUBT US?

11:13.967 --> 11:16.300
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR
FEELINGS FOR TOPANGA.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.767
IT'S JUST THAT
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
ARE VERY DIFFICULT.

11:19.767 --> 11:22.133
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU WANT US TO JUST GIVE UP?

11:22.133 --> 11:24.200
NO, CORY, I'M SAYING

11:24.200 --> 11:26.867
THAT YOU HAVE LIVED AROUND
THE CORNER FROM EACH OTHER
ALL YOUR LIVES,

11:26.867 --> 11:28.100
AND NOW YOU WON'T,

11:28.100 --> 11:30.000
AND THAT'S GOING
TO MAKE THINGS PAINFUL.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
WHY IS MOM TALKING
ABOUT PAIN?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.500
BECAUSE
IT MAY BE TOUGHER
THAN YOU THINK.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.800
LISTEN, GUYS,
TOPANGA AND I KNOW WHAT'S
IN EACH OTHER'S HEARTS, OK?

11:38.800 --> 11:41.967
AND IF OUR HEARTS SAY THAT
WE'RE WORTH ANY SACRIFICE
FOR EACH OTHER

11:41.967 --> 11:43.800
AND WE'RE WILLING TO MAKE
THOSE SACRIFICES

11:43.800 --> 11:46.200
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA
BE TOGETHER FOR THE REST
OF OUR LIVES,

11:46.200 --> 11:47.400
THEN WHY SHOULDN'T WE?

11:47.400 --> 11:49.467
THE REST
OF YOUR LIVES.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.567
CORY,
YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.233
YEAH, MOM,
SO ARE A COUPLE
OF FRIENDS OF MINE

11:53.233 --> 11:55.200
NAMED ROMEO AND JULIET,

11:55.200 --> 11:57.767
AND THEY TURNED OUT OK,
DIDN'T THEY?

12:01.934 --> 12:03.100
WON'T WORK?

12:03.100 --> 12:05.967
LOOK AT MY MAN ROMEO--
IN LOVE WITH HIS JULIET.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.367
NOTHING'S KEEPING THEM
APART.

12:07.367 --> 12:09.367
MR. MATTHEWS.

12:09.367 --> 12:11.300
BRUSHING UP
ON YOUR SHAKESPEARE?

12:11.300 --> 12:13.700
YEAH. YOU KNOW
HOW YOU ALWAYS TOLD US

12:13.700 --> 12:15.400
THAT WE SHOULD
TAKE WHAT WE LEARN
IN THE CLASSROOM

12:15.400 --> 12:17.200
AND APPLY IT
TO EVERYDAY LIFE?

12:17.200 --> 12:19.300
YOU AND TOPANGA?

12:19.300 --> 12:20.600
SHE'S MOVING TO PADUA.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
PITTSBURGH. SHE TOLD ME.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.300
I'M SORRY, MR. MATTHEWS.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.600
WELL, LISTEN,

12:25.600 --> 12:27.700
THERE ARE THOSE
WHO DON'T THINK
WE CAN MAKE IT

12:27.700 --> 12:30.200
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST
A COUPLE OF KIDS,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.500
BUT, YOU KNOW,
HERE'S THE PROOF,
MR. FEENY,

12:32.500 --> 12:35.100
THAT TWO KIDS
WITH EVERYTHING
GOING AGAINST THEM

12:35.100 --> 12:38.834
CAN TAKE
THE POWER OF LOVE
AND MAKE IT WORK.

12:38.834 --> 12:40.300
WHOA, BOY.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.900
WHAT?

12:41.900 --> 12:44.300
YOU HAVEN'T
ACTUALLY FINISHED
THE PLAY, HAVE YOU?

12:44.300 --> 12:46.300
WELL, THEY'RE IN LOVE.
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.133
FLIP AHEAD A LITTLE.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.500
"YEA NOISE?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.000
"THEN I'LL BE BRIEF.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.467
"O HAPPY DAGGER.

12:56.467 --> 12:58.400
"THIS IS THY SHEATH.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.400
"THERE RUST...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.300
AND LET ME DIE."

13:02.300 --> 13:04.500
"HAPPY DAGGER," SEE?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.233
HAPPY.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.400
"SHE PICKS UP
ROMEO'S DAGGER,

13:11.400 --> 13:12.767
STABS HERSELF AND DIES."

13:14.800 --> 13:16.300
SHAKESPEARE...

13:16.300 --> 13:17.500
WHAT A HACK.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.600
YOU KNOW, CORY...

13:21.600 --> 13:23.967
OVER THE COURSE
OF A PERSON'S LIFE,

13:23.967 --> 13:27.200
HE COMES ACROSS
A FEW DEFINING MOMENTS.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.100
NOW, THIS
IS ONE OF YOURS.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.200
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY,
REALLY?

13:33.200 --> 13:35.000
MR. FEENY, I DON'T KNOW.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.133
I MEAN...

13:36.133 --> 13:38.700
LOOK, PITTSBURGH'S
305 MILES AWAY.

13:40.934 --> 13:42.667
MAYBE I'M JUST
KIDDING MYSELF.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.400
OH, WELL, NOW...

13:44.400 --> 13:47.000
FOR AS LONG
AS I'VE KNOWN YOU,

13:47.000 --> 13:49.500
WHENEVER YOU'VE BEEN
FACED WITH ADVERSITY,

13:49.500 --> 13:51.734
YOU HAVE ALWAYS RISEN
TO THE OCCASION.

13:51.734 --> 13:54.400
NOW, I HAVE
NO REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT YOU WON'T AGAIN.

13:57.133 --> 14:00.834
DO YOU BELIEVE
THAT TWO 16-YEAR-OLDS
CAN BE IN LOVE...

14:00.834 --> 14:02.133
FRIAR FEENY?

14:05.200 --> 14:09.000
I BELIEVE THAT YOU
AND MISS LAWRENCE
HAVE SOMETHING

14:09.000 --> 14:11.734
THAT YOU WON'T
ALLOW YOURSELVES
TO LOSE.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.667
AND IF YOU SEARCH
YOUR HEART

14:15.667 --> 14:17.967
AND LISTEN
TO ITS INSTRUCTION,

14:17.967 --> 14:19.133
YOU WON'T GO WRONG.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.033
THANKS.

14:25.033 --> 14:26.033
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.400
MY TRUE JOURNEY
TO TOPANGA BEGINS, HUH?

14:33.567 --> 14:34.600
YES, WELL...

14:36.300 --> 14:37.834
THERE WE ARE.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.033
MARRY ME.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.400
WE'LL BUY A HOUSE,
START A FAMILY,

14:41.400 --> 14:43.200
AND LIVE
IN THE SAME CITY.

14:43.200 --> 14:44.567
CORY,
WE CAN'T GET MARRIED.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.000
LOOK, I KNOW
WE'LL STRUGGLE AT FIRST,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.400
BUT ALL COUPLES STRUGGLE
AT FIRST.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.600
I FIGURE WE GET A COUPLE
OF PART-TIME JOBS,

14:49.600 --> 14:51.000
CUT BACK ON EXPENSES,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.734
AND FIND
AN ABANDONED HOME

14:52.734 --> 14:54.033
IN AN UPSCALE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:54.033 --> 14:57.734
NO BUGS.
THAT'S ALL I ASK.
NO BUGS.

14:57.734 --> 14:59.100
CORY.

14:59.100 --> 15:01.200
ALL RIGHT, ONE BUG,
BUT NOTHING WITH TEETH.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.000
NOW LET'S GO SEE
WHAT YOUR PARENTS
WILL KICK IN, OK?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.300
COME ON, LET'S GO.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.300
CORY, WE CAN'T
GET MARRIED.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.667
CAN WE SEE EACH OTHER
EVERY WEEKEND?

15:12.667 --> 15:14.133
YEAH.

15:14.133 --> 15:16.200
CAN WE WRITE LETTERS
TO EACH OTHER EVERY DAY?

15:18.133 --> 15:20.567
YEAH.

15:20.567 --> 15:22.033
EVERY DAY.

15:24.734 --> 15:27.200
[SIGHS]

15:29.600 --> 15:32.667
LOOK, TOPANGA,
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

15:33.767 --> 15:36.000
I MEAN,
IT IS A NEW TOWN.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.600
IT'S A NEW SCHOOL.
IT'S NEW PEOPLE.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.667
I MEAN, PRETTY SOON

15:40.667 --> 15:44.367
GUYS ARE GONNA BE
LINING UP TO ASK YOU OUT.

15:44.367 --> 15:46.500
I MEAN,
WITH ME NOT THERE,

15:46.500 --> 15:47.867
WHY SHOULDN'T YOU ACCEPT?

15:47.867 --> 15:49.400
WHAT ABOUT YOU, CORY?

15:49.400 --> 15:52.000
I KNOW A MILLION GIRLS
WHO WOULD LOVE
TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.767
REALLY?

15:53.767 --> 15:55.467
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT 10.

15:55.467 --> 15:56.967
CORY.

15:56.967 --> 16:00.200
IT'S A LITTLE
TENSION BREAKER.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.400
SO WHERE DOES THAT
LEAVE US?

16:03.400 --> 16:05.934
I'M LEAVING
FOR PITTSBURGH
TOMORROW NIGHT.

16:07.834 --> 16:08.500
YEAH.

16:11.567 --> 16:13.967
WELL, IT'S A LONG WALK
TO PITTSBURGH.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.400
SO DOES THAT MEAN
I HAVE TO GIVE YOU BACK
YOUR JEAN JACKET?

16:20.800 --> 16:22.233
NO.

16:22.233 --> 16:23.300
KEEP IT.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.133
IT'S YOURS.

16:28.967 --> 16:31.500
LIKE I AM.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.934
GOOD...

16:32.934 --> 16:35.200
'CAUSE I WOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN IT BACK
TO YOU ANYWAY.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.600
SO...

16:43.600 --> 16:46.400
WHAT ARE YOU AND TOPANGA
DOING THIS WEEKEND?

16:48.500 --> 16:50.300
YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
IT OCCURS TO ME

16:50.300 --> 16:52.300
THAT WE HAVE
BEEN HERE AN HOUR,

16:52.300 --> 16:54.300
AND YOU HAVE YET
TO FEEL BAD FOR ME.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.467
NOW WHY HAVEN'T YOU
FELT BAD FOR ME?

16:57.467 --> 17:00.233
CORY, WOULD YOU SAY
THAT I HAPPEN TO WATCH
A LOT OF TV?

17:00.233 --> 17:01.900
MORE THAN ANYONE I KNOW.
WHY?

17:01.900 --> 17:04.900
I HAVE SEEN THIS PLOT
A THOUSAND TIMES,

17:04.900 --> 17:07.100
AND IT ALWAYS ENDS
EXACTLY THE SAME.

17:07.100 --> 17:10.200
THE GIRLFRIEND
NEVER MOVES AWAY.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.367
SHAWN,
THIS GIRLFRIEND'S MOM
GOT A JOB IN PITTSBURGH.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.500
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.667
I KNOW, ALL PACKED UP,
ENROLLED IN A NEW SCHOOL,

17:16.667 --> 17:19.934
BOO-HOO, TEARS, TEARS.
GIVE ME A CHALLENGE, OK?

17:19.934 --> 17:22.000
TOPANGA IS NOT GOING
ANYWHERE.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.567
SHAWN, IT'S NOT TV.

17:23.567 --> 17:24.934
TRUST ME.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.900
S-SO...

17:27.900 --> 17:30.200
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SHE CAN'T MOVE

17:30.200 --> 17:32.400
IF WE'RE REALLY SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER?

17:32.400 --> 17:35.400
NOT IF TV
IS THE TRUE MIRROR
OF OUR LIVES.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.000
OK, OK. BUT WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.734
NOW, TOMORROW NIGHT
SHE'S COMING OVER
TO MY HOUSE

17:39.734 --> 17:41.567
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

17:41.567 --> 17:42.967
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

17:42.967 --> 17:45.400
WHAT ABOUT<i>ER?</i>

17:45.400 --> 17:47.600
NOW, THE DOCTOR ON<i>ER,</i>
SHE REALLY LEFT.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.200
WHAT ABOUT HER?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.300
<i>ER's </i>REAL.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.200
AHH.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.200
[CHUCKLES]

17:56.200 --> 17:57.967
SO...

17:57.967 --> 18:00.100
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
SHE'S GONNA LEAVE, DO YOU?

18:00.100 --> 18:01.100
NO, I DON'T.

18:01.100 --> 18:02.300
AND WHY NOT?

18:02.300 --> 18:04.500
BECAUSE
YOU DON'T DESERVE
THAT KIND OF PAIN.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.734
HI, CORY.

18:11.734 --> 18:13.700
HI, SHAWN.
THANKS FOR COMING.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.467
SURE, TOPANGA.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.467
<i>REALLY </i>SORRY
YOU'RE MOVING.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.600
TOPANGA,
I WAS THINKING
SATURDAY NIGHT

18:22.600 --> 18:24.000
MAYBE YOU AND I,
WE COULD GO OUT
TO DINNER,

18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
WE COULD SEE A MOVIE,
WE COULD HOLD EACH OTHER
FOR 5 HOURS.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.767
CORY,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

18:27.767 --> 18:29.133
I CAME OVER
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.
THAT'S HARD ENOUGH.

18:29.133 --> 18:30.567
TOPANGA, LISTEN,
WE DON'T NEED
TO SAY GOOD-BYE

18:30.567 --> 18:34.200
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.
YOU'RE NOT MOVING.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.033
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
SAYING?

18:36.033 --> 18:37.967
MY PARENTS
ARE IN THE CAR
WAITING FOR ME.

18:37.967 --> 18:39.667
WE'RE LEAVING
FOR PITTSBURGH.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.033
NO, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE NOT MOVING

18:41.033 --> 18:42.900
BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE TOGETHER

18:42.900 --> 18:44.734
LIKE WE'VE ALWAYS
TALKED ABOUT,

18:44.734 --> 18:45.934
SO YOU CAN'T MOVE,

18:45.934 --> 18:49.300
BECAUSE WE DON'T DESERVE
THAT KIND OF PAIN.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.967
CORY, WILL YOU JUST
GIVE ME A HUG AND A KISS
AND SAY GOOD-BYE TO ME?

18:51.967 --> 18:53.867
NO.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.200
GOOD-BYE, CORY.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.767
I LOVE YOU.

19:17.233 --> 19:18.667
SHAWN,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:18.667 --> 19:19.900
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

19:19.900 --> 19:20.967
[VOICE BREAKING]
THAT CAR'S GONNA
TURN AROUND.

19:20.967 --> 19:24.900
JUST WAIT. JUST WATCH.
ANY SECOND NOW.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.700
UH-HUH.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.734
JUST WAIT.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.500
OK.

19:34.033 --> 19:37.100
WHAT THE HELL
KIND OF TV SHOW
IS THIS?

19:42.934 --> 19:45.667
SHAWN, YOU KNOW
THAT PAIN EVERYONE
KEEPS TALKING ABOUT?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.133
YEAH?

19:50.467 --> 19:52.800
I THINK I'M STARTING
TO FEEL IT.

20:07.934 --> 20:09.000
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:11.467 --> 20:13.467
NOT MUCH.

20:13.467 --> 20:14.667
[SNIFFS]

20:14.667 --> 20:16.467
SMELLS GOOD OUT HERE.
WHAT IS THAT, TREES?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.567
I DIDN'T EVEN
SAY GOOD-BYE, ERIC.

20:25.667 --> 20:26.200
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.834
YOU'LL SAY GOOD-BYE
THE NEXT TIME YOU SAY
HELLO.

20:28.834 --> 20:29.834
PITTSBURGH'S
NOT THAT FAR.

20:29.834 --> 20:31.233
I MADE THE DRIVE
LAST NIGHT.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.300
YOU REALLY WENT?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.500
OH, YEAH.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.200

MET A COUPLE GIRLS,

20:37.200 --> 20:38.700
TOLD THEM I DROVE
ALL THE WAY FROM PHILLY,

AND HERE I AM.

LOOK, I WAS
GONNA GO OUT,
I DON'T KNOW,

RENT SOME MOVIES.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.367
YOU WANT TO GO?

20:49.367 --> 20:50.734
NO, THANKS.

20:50.734 --> 20:51.734

IT'LL BE MY TREAT.

20:51.734 --> 20:53.133
WE'LL GO
TO LITTLE TONY'S.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.734

I WANT TO STAY HERE.

HOW TO PROTECT YOU
FROM THIS ONE.

STAY HERE WITH ME?
