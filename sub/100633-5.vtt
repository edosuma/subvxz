00:22.856 --> 00:24.792
[exhales]

00:24.891 --> 00:28.161
For the last time, dude,
get the fuck out of here

00:28.260 --> 00:30.564
with the "Gandalf could just
fly over Middle-earth

00:30.564 --> 00:35.201
and drop the ring
into the fires of Mount Doom
from atop an eagle" bullshit!

00:35.301 --> 00:38.505
I've clearly laid it out
on a LOTR subreddit.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.207
What do you want to watch?

00:41.307 --> 00:42.776
We could watch Harley Quinn.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.076
[spluttering]

00:44.176 --> 00:45.612
-No!
-Have you seen the show?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.381
Oh, God, no!

00:47.381 --> 00:50.616
It's just another heavy-handed
female empowerment story,

00:50.618 --> 00:54.353
where the true villain
is the quote-unquote
"patriarchy."

00:54.454 --> 00:55.454
So basic.

00:55.555 --> 00:56.613
Yeah, I guess.

00:56.613 --> 01:00.093
I heard Harley takes down Joker
at the end of season one!

01:00.093 --> 01:04.463
I'm sorry, but "cucked" isn't
a great color on the greatest
villain of all time.

01:04.564 --> 01:06.533
That's what this review says.

01:06.632 --> 01:08.569
-[slurping]
-Hey, you wrote this one.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.337
I can't believe you want
to watch this show.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.408
You know, they just did
a three-episode arc,
where Harley beats Penguin,

01:14.507 --> 01:17.444
Riddler and Mr. Freeze,
using nothing
but her Mary Sue powers!

01:17.543 --> 01:19.546
Are you sure you haven't
seen the show?

01:19.646 --> 01:22.481
Yeah! 'Cause I'm not
a 12-year old girl.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.150
Also, dude,

01:24.251 --> 01:27.219
why would I watch a show
that's set in Gotham City,

01:27.319 --> 01:28.621
but Batman's barely in it?

01:28.721 --> 01:30.456
You watched
all five seasons of Gotham.

01:30.557 --> 01:34.361
Because it wasn't
a fucking tsunami
of virtue signaling.

01:34.460 --> 01:35.768
Here, smart guy.

01:35.768 --> 01:39.198
Let's see what
this week's episode
of Harley Quinn is about.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.135
"Harley Quinn
and her best friend,
Poison Ivy..."

01:42.135 --> 01:43.135
See?

01:43.135 --> 01:47.340
"...aren't in this episode,
which focuses on Batman
waking from his coma

01:47.340 --> 01:49.742
and vowing to take back
Gotham City."

01:49.843 --> 01:53.914
Fuck! Fine! But if it sucks,
we're watching Family Guy.

01:54.013 --> 01:57.164
[theme music playing]

02:07.527 --> 02:08.929

-[Bruce groans]
-It's not as bad
as it looks.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.590
Why don't you
come back to bed?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.625
I've made you
a cup of honey tea

02:38.724 --> 02:40.165
and pigs in blankets.

02:40.165 --> 02:43.330
I don't want pigs in a blanket.
I want to fight crime.

02:44.330 --> 02:45.610
I will take that honey tea.

02:45.610 --> 02:48.769
Let's get you
back to bed, Master Bruce.
You need your rest.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.236
I've rested enough.
Gotham needs Batman.

02:51.237 --> 02:54.441
And it will get him,
once he's made
a full physical recovery.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.842
In the time
you were in a coma,

02:55.842 --> 02:58.711
312 new television shows
came out.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.747
What say we be binge buddies?

03:01.748 --> 03:04.250
-Get me Jim Gordon.
-We needn't bother Mr. Gordon.

03:04.251 --> 03:07.454
He's making sure law and order
are returned to the city.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.222
We are so fucked!

03:09.222 --> 03:10.991
It's a shit show out there!

03:11.091 --> 03:12.925
I saw a dog kill a man
on the street,

03:12.925 --> 03:16.329
and then I saw the dog do
other things to that man.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.564
What, have you
been in a coma
these last few months?

03:18.564 --> 03:20.500
No. I've been doing stuff.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.871
Ah! [chuckles] You playboys,
always doing stuff.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.034
Must be nice.

03:25.034 --> 03:27.574
Now, I brought
a list of things
I need you to pay for,

03:27.674 --> 03:29.376
so I can take back the city.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.979
One, police officers.
Two, a codpiece that I can wear

03:33.080 --> 03:35.247
that opens up and shoots
a tiny missile.

03:35.348 --> 03:36.515
That doesn't exist.

03:36.616 --> 03:38.651
Not yet.

03:38.651 --> 03:40.486
That's where you
and your fat wallet come in.

03:40.486 --> 03:43.556
Mr. Wayne is not going
to bankroll your imaginary--

03:43.556 --> 03:45.324
Tone it down there, limey.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.995
Now, look, I'm the only one
who can save the city.

03:48.094 --> 03:50.597
At least, since the Bat
abandoned us.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.498
Are there no heroes left
in Gotham?

03:52.498 --> 03:56.741
[groans]
Just a couple of amateurs
popping off. Take a look.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.711
[Gordon] This Yankee doodle
dandy in a powdered wig
calls himself "The Macaroni."

04:04.812 --> 04:06.301
-[man grunts]
-As in...

04:06.301 --> 04:07.914
â™ª Stuck a feather
in his hat... â™ª

04:07.914 --> 04:09.449
And you know the rest.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.350
[Bruce] That wig's a walking
"kick me" sign.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.954
If you think that's bad,
check out the broad
in the bat suit.

04:14.054 --> 04:16.857
[Gordon] They're calling
her Batgirl.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.492
That's futile.
These lightweights
aren't prepared

04:19.492 --> 04:22.728
to go mano y mano
with Two-Face or Bane.

04:22.829 --> 04:26.365
Without Batman, people don't
have the balls to fight back.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.504
I got word
Quinn took down Freeze.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.607
That clown is a pain
in my ass.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.408
-Hey, that's not your chair.
-[grunts]

04:35.509 --> 04:37.744
We're keeping it open
for honorary purposes.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.346
-That's your chair.
-[groans]

04:39.346 --> 04:40.512
Have some respect.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.048
[Bane] Oh, okay.

04:42.149 --> 04:44.918
Does this rule apply
to parking spots?

04:45.019 --> 04:47.788
If so, I'll need to
move my Volvo.

04:47.887 --> 04:49.889
Look, I've been doing
some thinking.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.492
[chuckles]

04:52.591 --> 04:54.661
Oh, sorry, I thought
that was a punchline.

04:54.761 --> 04:57.596
Quinn's on a dare.
And we're next.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.399
Maybe we should
consolidate power

05:00.500 --> 05:04.071
and join forces
to protect ourselves
from external threats.

05:04.170 --> 05:06.072
What, you and me? Collab?

05:06.173 --> 05:09.509
Ha! You got your hands full
with Banetown.

05:09.509 --> 05:12.678
Hey, it's the locals.
We say "Bane-ton."

05:12.778 --> 05:16.382
The way you remember it,
it rhymes with Plankton.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.384
That's a soft rhyme at best.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.300
Look, I'm not worried
about Quinn.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.156
Besides, why would I
want to team up
with the likes of you?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.992
You don't even have
a big boy chair.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.427
I... [grunting]

05:27.526 --> 05:29.795
-[grunts]
-Ah, don't get your little
singlet in a bunch,

05:29.797 --> 05:30.930
I'm just having a goof.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.033
So, are we teaming up?

05:33.966 --> 05:35.966
-No.

05:49.216 --> 05:53.386
[panting] Hey, guys,
today's safety tip.

05:53.485 --> 05:55.689
Instead of going to a party
this Friday night,

05:55.788 --> 05:59.093
sign up for
a self-defense class.
Right, buddy?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.761
This is Batgirl, signing off.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.762
[grunts]

06:02.728 --> 06:04.598
Research, Master Wayne?

06:04.697 --> 06:07.867
This sorority girl
can't run around
wearing the bat symbol!

06:07.867 --> 06:09.767
It's gonna make people
think I'm back!

06:09.767 --> 06:12.939
So your quibble is with
the unsanctioned use
of your logo, sir?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.908
A, it's not a logo.
It's a symbol,

06:15.007 --> 06:17.009
meant to strike fear into
the hearts of criminals.

06:17.011 --> 06:19.846
And B, if that little girl's
killed while wearing it,

06:19.947 --> 06:21.747
the city of Gotham
will lose all hope.

06:21.747 --> 06:24.184
Well, there's nothing you can
do about it now, Master Wayne.

06:24.185 --> 06:26.086
You can barely make
a solid bowel movement.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.021
Well, maybe Bruce Wayne can't.

06:28.122 --> 06:30.922
But I know someone who can.

06:36.762 --> 06:37.764
[Batgirl grunts]

-Who's there?
-Always check your six.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.673
[squealing excitedly]
Oh, my God! Batman?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.076
I am such a stan!

06:49.175 --> 06:51.478
-Hmm.
-I'm wearing your logo.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.047
It's a symbol.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.714
And one you shouldn't
be wearing.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.817
Oh, frick! Is it copyrighted?

06:56.817 --> 06:59.653
I swear to God I'm not making
any money off of it.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.521
It took me years of training
to establish trust with
the people of Gotham.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.658
You're out of your depth.
It's not safe.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.627
I appreciate your notes,
but I can handle myself.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.197
-You were saying?
-[gasps]

07:11.197 --> 07:12.333
Oh, my God, you guys,

07:12.333 --> 07:14.901
I have awesome breaking news.

07:15.002 --> 07:19.206
Batman...
Yes, The Batman
is back in Gotham.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.940
Do you still have
a million followers?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.242
Actually 1.3 million.

07:22.242 --> 07:24.177
Yeah, but most of them
are bots, right?

07:24.177 --> 07:26.677
-Batman is back!
-Hmm.

07:31.817 --> 07:35.088
Ladies and gents,
going to need you
to stay calm

07:35.189 --> 07:38.557
while my associates and I
relieve this establishment

07:38.557 --> 07:40.927
of a little coin.
You know I like coins.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.062
[chuckles] Fill her up,
sweetheart.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.632
No! We're not afraid
of you anymore.

07:45.732 --> 07:49.702
What? Of course you are.
Look at the guns
and half my face.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.870
[grunts]

07:52.738 --> 07:54.740
Ow! Ow, fuck!

07:54.841 --> 07:58.677
We're not afraid,
'cause Batman's back.

07:58.778 --> 08:00.646
Just leave us alone.

08:00.747 --> 08:01.949
Yeah.

08:02.048 --> 08:04.050
Wait, Batman's really back?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.653
-[people cheering]
-That's right.
Rebellion is in the air!

08:07.754 --> 08:09.622
Batman's back, baby!

08:09.723 --> 08:12.559
And with him,
hope for the people
of Gotham!

08:12.658 --> 08:15.928
I'm gonna live forever!
Batman's back!

08:15.928 --> 08:16.930
[woman grunts]

08:19.065 --> 08:21.168
You can wipe that smug look
off your face.

08:21.267 --> 08:22.802
That's not smug.

08:22.903 --> 08:24.937
-This is smug.
-Devastating.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.173
I never said I was back.
Batgirl did.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.209
Yet, you didn't deny it.

08:29.310 --> 08:32.245
And now all of Gotham is
as full of false hope as
an undercooked meat pie!

08:32.346 --> 08:35.782
Enlighten me.
Why can't Batman be back?

08:35.881 --> 08:37.583
Still unable
to reach your feet?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.254
I've been rocking slip-ons.
My feet run hot.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.990
But if you think I'm too weak
to get back out there
and I'll fail, just say it.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.192
You're too weak
and will fail.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.927
I am strong and will succeed!

08:47.027 --> 08:48.662
Fine. Prove it.
Put these on.

08:52.166 --> 08:54.600
[groaning] Come on.

08:55.067 --> 08:56.702
Come on!

08:56.802 --> 08:57.937
[grunting]

08:58.038 --> 09:01.041
Oh, that's right, you can't.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.643
Seems to me,
the city's protector
should be able to

09:03.743 --> 09:06.212
put his sockie-poos
on his feetsies.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.850
But what do I know?
I just took you in after
your parents were murdered,

09:09.850 --> 09:12.052
loved you like I would
my own son.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.754
Cared for you unconditionally.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.857
Changed your diapers
when you were in a coma.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.808
You don't know
what it's like
to be a warrior.

09:19.808 --> 09:21.760
I'll have you know,
I was in Her Majesty's
Royal Navy.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.197
What did you guys fight over?

09:23.197 --> 09:24.998
[in British accent]
Who get the last scone?

09:25.097 --> 09:26.265
On occasion, we did.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.201
Your ego is writing checks

09:28.201 --> 09:31.804
your broken body
cannot cash, sir.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.808
"Your ego's writing checks..."
[blabbering]

09:35.908 --> 09:37.010
Connect me to Lucius Fox.

09:41.048 --> 09:46.048
Oh! There you are, buddy.
Hey, I got a surprise for you.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.094
-[chair squeaking]
-Huh?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.129
How does she ride?
Ain't she a beaut?

09:56.230 --> 09:58.899
Look, it's adjustable.
It can be any height
you want it to be.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.033
It's like magic.

10:00.134 --> 10:02.068
Yeah. I love it.

10:02.068 --> 10:04.370
The lower lumbar support
is helpful.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.567
[grunts]

10:05.567 --> 10:09.708
Not a lot of chairs
designed for guys
with overdeveloped traps.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.812
You look parched.
Let me get you a drink.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.414
If I remember correctly,
you're a sparkling guy, right?

10:14.514 --> 10:15.782
Aw!

10:15.881 --> 10:17.250
[slurping]

10:17.350 --> 10:19.885
Is that coconut?
[slurping]

10:22.456 --> 10:23.765
Delicious!

10:23.765 --> 10:26.225
Hey, I admit I was
being tough on you yesterday.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.195
But that was just some
good-natured ribbing.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.962
Brotherly love, et cetera.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.298
It felt very personal.

10:31.398 --> 10:32.832
And frankly, mean-spirited.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.500
Well, I've thought about
what you said

10:34.501 --> 10:36.802
in regards to us
joining forces,

10:36.802 --> 10:40.706
and how we're more likely
to survive if we stick
together, and I'm in.

10:40.807 --> 10:44.244
Let's do it, you and me,
an equal partnership.
Fifty-fifty.

10:44.244 --> 10:49.149
Hmm. Does this have anything
to do with Batman coming back?

10:49.249 --> 10:51.217
-Can I be honest with you?
-Of course.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.385
It does not.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.388
So what do you say,
partner?

10:54.488 --> 10:57.024
As long as it's 50-50.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.859
All right,
now let's talk branding.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.360
We need to communicate
that we're working together,

11:01.361 --> 11:02.895
and not to be fucked with.

11:02.895 --> 11:04.730
I got something I wanna
show you. Hey, boys!

11:07.167 --> 11:11.270
But... That's not a...
That's just a picture of you.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.207
I'm not even on the poster...
[stammers]

11:14.307 --> 11:15.975
Where's the 50 and 50?

11:15.975 --> 11:17.510
What are you talking about?
That's you, right there.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.145
No, that is a shadow.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.748
I was born there,
but that's not me.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.884
And look,
it's only got your name on it!

11:23.984 --> 11:25.784
What are you talking about!

11:25.785 --> 11:28.922
That's you, that's me.
We each got a face.
Two-Faces.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.325
I think it's too much
of a thinker.

11:31.325 --> 11:33.360
Nah, everyone knows
that it's the both of us.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.495
Equal partners, right?

11:35.495 --> 11:40.299
[stammers] I would be
open to a bus poster,
like the twins poster,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.168
where it's you,
but it says Bane.

11:42.269 --> 11:44.303
And then it's me,
but it says Two-Face.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.273
But I've gotta be
on there.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.142
Otherwise, you know,
this is...

11:49.243 --> 11:50.777
I'm a name.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.812
Loaded with firepower
and razor-sharp weaponry,

11:53.913 --> 11:58.418
the titanium-dipped
body armor comes fitted with
a strength-compensation dial.

11:58.519 --> 12:03.519
I've also added a customized
AI to provide tech support
and system analysis.

12:03.624 --> 12:05.426
Her name is Monica.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.826
[sighs]

12:07.927 --> 12:09.495
You deserve better, Monica.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.167
[laughing]

12:14.268 --> 12:15.535
Oh, hello, Alfred.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.504
Going behind my back
to have Lucius build you

12:17.605 --> 12:20.139
a bat suit to compensate
for your feeble state?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.009
No, I'm just hanging
with my buddy,

12:23.009 --> 12:25.446
like friends do. Jealous?

12:25.546 --> 12:27.947
Oh, look! A suit of lies.

12:27.947 --> 12:32.918
You cannot fight crime
in your current
physical condition.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.956
Yeah. That's what
the suit is for.
Tell him, Lucius.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.259
I need to get going.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.193
I have Pilates tonight.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.129
-Alfred.
-Lucius.

12:45.633 --> 12:48.835
You're not getting that suit
and you're not to fight crime.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.437
I forbid it.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.474
Fine. If that's
the way you feel.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.241
Forgive me
if I don't trust you.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.110
This is coming with me.

12:57.210 --> 12:58.979
-[whimpering and grunting]
-[creaking]

13:01.148 --> 13:02.416
The dolly's got a bum wheel.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.734
[Alfred grunting]

13:09.623 --> 13:10.990
Elevator's broken.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.359
[Alfred continues grunting]

13:12.458 --> 13:13.927
[Alfred] No trouble at all.

-[clanking and thudding]

13:17.464 --> 13:18.464

13:21.967 --> 13:22.967
[softly] Monica.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.239
[swooshing]

13:27.106 --> 13:29.009
[shushing] Quiet.

13:31.412 --> 13:33.062
[swooshing]

13:49.296 --> 13:50.645
[snoring]

13:59.004 --> 14:01.274
[Monica] You're looking great
this evening, Batman.

14:01.375 --> 14:02.908
-[beeping]
-Let's do this!

14:03.409 --> 14:04.477
[grunts]

14:05.946 --> 14:07.147
[grunts]

14:07.246 --> 14:08.749
[Monica] Stun mode activated.

14:10.484 --> 14:12.184
-[pipe clangs]
-[Batman] "Not ready," my ass.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.184
[Monica] Indeed, sir.

14:13.453 --> 14:14.803
[beeping]

14:23.196 --> 14:24.196
[man grunts]

14:25.732 --> 14:27.033
[yelling]

14:27.033 --> 14:28.567
-Who are you working for?
-[whimpers]

14:29.201 --> 14:30.671
[Batman] Two-Face.

14:30.671 --> 14:33.307
[Monica] Threat identified.
Proceed with caution.

14:33.407 --> 14:34.441
-[beeping]
-Bane.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.211
We thought you
were dead, Batman.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.047
Bad news. I'm not.

14:41.148 --> 14:43.256
[Bane grunts]

14:46.086 --> 14:48.589
My beef isn't with you, Bane.
I'm here for Two-Face.

14:48.688 --> 14:50.222
He's clearly running
this operation.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.326
What? No!

14:52.426 --> 14:53.927
[grunting]

14:54.027 --> 14:57.777
-[crack]
-[Batman grunts]

15:00.299 --> 15:03.035
[Bane] I am also
equally in charge.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.605
Not by the look of things.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.173
[Bane grunts]

15:06.273 --> 15:08.708
No! It's Two Faces!

15:08.808 --> 15:11.644
Plural. My face and his face.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.615
I am one of the two faces.
We are partners!

15:14.715 --> 15:16.416
He already has two faces.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.552
If he were your partner,
that would be three faces.

15:18.552 --> 15:19.952
[Bane grunting angrily]

15:20.052 --> 15:22.389
I knew it was too much
of a thinker!

15:25.558 --> 15:26.960
[Bane grunting]

15:26.960 --> 15:30.230
[Monica] Code red.
Threat level, 100%.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.431
[both grunt]

15:32.466 --> 15:34.201
[Batman grunts]

15:34.301 --> 15:35.469
[Monica] Caution. Caution.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.568
[distorting] Cau...

15:39.472 --> 15:41.006
[groans]

15:41.106 --> 15:44.043
I am the shadow
that haunts your darkness!

15:44.144 --> 15:45.245
[Batman sighs]

15:45.345 --> 15:46.346
[Batman] Last chance.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.280
Where's Two-Face?

15:48.381 --> 15:49.381
[grunts]

15:50.717 --> 15:51.717
[Bane] Ahhh!

15:54.587 --> 15:56.687

[Bane yells]

16:39.466 --> 16:43.437

break the Bat!

16:49.610 --> 16:53.078
Bane, you gullible fool!

16:53.179 --> 16:56.216
[panting and groaning]
Monica, call Lucius Fox.

16:56.316 --> 16:57.350
[system shutting down]

16:57.451 --> 16:59.119
Well, what do we have here?

16:59.219 --> 17:01.053
Boss is gonna love this.

17:01.153 --> 17:05.826
[laughs] Looks like ya got
your bell rung
real good, Batty.

17:08.494 --> 17:11.464
-We cooked up
something special for ya!
-[crackling]

17:11.565 --> 17:14.468
Why didn't you wake up
and stop me, Alfred?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.069
To repay you
for years of torment,

17:17.069 --> 17:20.406
we're gonna make
a little video for
all of Gotham to see.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.309
[chuckles] Yeah!
Then we're gonna post it!

17:23.410 --> 17:25.578
-[chuckles]
-That's implied, Rick.

17:25.679 --> 17:29.415
Everyone's gonna know
it was Two-face's crew
that killed Batman!

17:29.516 --> 17:31.218
[scraping]

17:31.317 --> 17:32.486
You two, go check it out.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.555
[grunts]

17:35.722 --> 17:36.789
[grunts] What the...

17:37.758 --> 17:39.458
It's "The Macaroni."

17:43.564 --> 17:44.564
[grunts]

17:45.464 --> 17:46.964
[grunting]

17:53.941 --> 17:55.342
[access platform whirring]

17:56.476 --> 17:59.346

17:59.445 --> 18:01.181
-[Batman] Who are you?
-My liege.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.482
-Alfred.
-Just doing my part, sir.

18:03.584 --> 18:05.685
That wig is pretty impractical.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.321
[grunts]

18:09.423 --> 18:10.590
Let's get you on your feet.

18:10.691 --> 18:12.558
Just say it.
Say, "I told you so."

18:12.659 --> 18:15.194
A gentleman
does not trade in such
pedestrian platitudes.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.329
[grunts]

18:17.431 --> 18:19.866
But he does know
when to ask for help.

18:19.967 --> 18:21.468
A little assistance, my lady.

18:21.567 --> 18:22.567
[Batgirl] Be right there!

18:22.635 --> 18:23.636
[both grunt]

18:26.440 --> 18:27.507
Oh, yikes.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.809
Your legs
are hella jacked up.

18:29.910 --> 18:33.512
One of them's, like, going
that way and the other one's
all floppy and stuff.

18:33.512 --> 18:34.681
It's gross.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.682
[Batman] Can you just
help me up?

18:36.784 --> 18:40.534
[old-timey music playing]

18:42.355 --> 18:43.656
-[Bane yelling]
-[explosion]

18:43.757 --> 18:44.892
Jesus, what now!

18:44.991 --> 18:46.425
[yelling]

18:47.994 --> 18:52.633
I was born in hell,
and I demand respect!

18:52.732 --> 18:55.201
I crushed Batman.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.837
Perhaps I should do
the same to you?

18:57.938 --> 19:00.539
Tranquilo, baby, tranquilo!

19:00.641 --> 19:03.743
I want to hear you out,
but I cannot talk to you
when you're like this.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.913
I beg you, please, calm down.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.414
Do one of those
breathing exercises you're
always telling me about.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.664
Oh, sorry. [groaning]

19:15.923 --> 19:18.391
Better. Now, talk to me.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.894
You said this was
an equal partnership,

19:20.894 --> 19:22.829
but even Batman thinks
you're running Gotham.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.932
Ah, don't listen to bat face.
He's just messing
with your head.

19:26.032 --> 19:27.500
[breathing heavily]

19:27.601 --> 19:29.803
[grunting]

19:29.903 --> 19:32.940
-Focus.
-Now, when you say,
"Crushed him,"

19:33.039 --> 19:34.540
does that mean he's dead?

19:34.540 --> 19:36.442
His legs were parting
in different directions!

19:36.442 --> 19:38.217
-It was gross.
-In the future,

19:38.217 --> 19:41.848
I think we should just kill
Batman when we get the chance,
but you did a good job, buddy.

19:41.949 --> 19:44.817
See, I contribute
to this business.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.354
We need a new name
that represents both of us.

19:47.453 --> 19:48.989
The Bane of Your Existence?

19:49.088 --> 19:50.691
Bane Capital?

19:50.790 --> 19:52.592
Not that,
but something like that.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.094
We... we can pitch on it.

19:54.094 --> 19:55.996
It's not the name.
The name's workin'.

19:55.996 --> 19:59.767
What I think is you need
to have room to do
your best work.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.703
Space to spread out
and explore all the nooks
and crannies

20:03.703 --> 20:05.372
in that big ol'
noggin of yours.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.740
To find what sparks my joy?

20:07.840 --> 20:09.342
Exactly.

20:09.343 --> 20:11.778
And I know just the place
for you to do that.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.381
[Bane groans]

20:15.015 --> 20:16.784
Eh.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.486
[voice breaking]
That's beautiful.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.622
See? Isn't that nice?

20:21.721 --> 20:26.721
Who takes care of you?
Right, buddy?

20:30.463 --> 20:33.634
[gasps] Sweet mother
of Canadian Club!

20:33.733 --> 20:35.402
-Are you sitting?
-Sometimes I sit.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.804
-Never seen it.
-You don't know
everything I do.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.507
[sighing] You don't write,
you don't call.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.308
I thought you'd abandoned us.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.810
I would never
give upon Gotham.

20:43.911 --> 20:47.047
Well, uh, I can get you
up to speed real quick.

20:47.048 --> 20:50.651
The city's in the shitter.
We have a lot of work
to do, partner.

20:50.651 --> 20:53.286
Should probably start
by taking back the GCPD.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.688
There was a coup, of sorts.

20:54.788 --> 20:57.289
-No.
-Okay, we'll start smaller.

20:57.289 --> 20:58.925
Gotta walk before we can run.

20:59.026 --> 21:00.326
Uh, how about the docks?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.762
No, I mean, I can't work.

21:02.863 --> 21:05.031
[chuckles] I'm trying
to do the math here.

21:05.132 --> 21:07.800
Uh, you're back,
crime's at an all-time high.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.002
What's the problem?

21:09.002 --> 21:10.871
I'm not physically able.
Currently.

21:10.971 --> 21:12.873
-Is that why you're sitting?
-Maybe.

21:12.873 --> 21:15.009
I need a little time
to get back to
my fighting weight.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.742
Your fighting weight? Okay.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.746
And how long are we talking?
A week, a month, uh...

21:19.747 --> 21:20.814
Gotham needs a bat!

21:20.913 --> 21:22.449
I agree.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.984
-[crying] And I need a partner.
-Also agree.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.520
And I know
the perfect person for the job.

21:27.520 --> 21:29.422
Jim, meet Batgirl.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.625
It's a real honor to meet you,
Da... Commissioner.

21:32.726 --> 21:33.961
What's she doing here?

21:33.961 --> 21:35.761
Like you said,
the city needs the bat.

21:35.863 --> 21:37.698
The bat inspires fear
in criminals,

21:37.698 --> 21:39.598
and hope
in the people of Gotham.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.102
And with your help,
Batgirl can keep
that hope alive.

21:42.202 --> 21:44.503
[chuckling] You want us
to work together?

21:44.604 --> 21:45.712
It's temporary.

21:45.712 --> 21:48.913
The people of Gotham
need to believe that Batman
is still out there.

21:49.977 --> 21:50.977
Uh...

21:52.412 --> 21:54.780
[resigned sigh]

21:54.882 --> 21:57.384
We will literally have
the best time.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.096
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:59.096 --> 22:04.096
-Hey, guys, Batgirl here,
and I've got some big news!
-[sighs]

22:07.626 --> 22:08.996
-I liked it.
-[slurping]

22:10.998 --> 22:12.665
Batgirl should have
smiled more.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.433
You wanna watch
another one?

22:14.534 --> 22:15.935
Fine. Whatever.

22:16.036 --> 22:17.470
It doesn't come out
for a week?

22:17.570 --> 22:20.707
This distribution model
is ridiculous!

22:20.807 --> 22:22.875
[sighs] Let's just
torrent some hentai.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.845
[theme music playing]
