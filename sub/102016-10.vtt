01:14.700 --> 01:16.368
And after serving
our sentences,

01:16.368 --> 01:18.537
we're going to devote our lives
to community service.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.900
What is that sound?

01:48.900 --> 01:50.277
I'm humming.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.695
A song.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.405
Are you unwell?

01:53.405 --> 01:56.116
Quite the opposite. Everything
is right in the world.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.493
Lizzie and I are friends again,
Landon's back, and I haven't

01:58.493 --> 02:00.287
seen any new monsters,
which means the defensive

02:00.287 --> 02:02.456
perimeter I spelled
around the school is working.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.750
Today is going to be a good day.

02:04.750 --> 02:05.876
I hope.
Morning, Cleo.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.794
Morning.
I got tea.

02:07.794 --> 02:10.672
See? Scones. Hi.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.882
Uh, um...

02:13.133 --> 02:15.260
Are you feeling okay?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.595
Why does everybody
keep asking me that?

02:16.595 --> 02:18.013
Yeah, um, uh,
you didn't happen

02:18.013 --> 02:19.931
to see any slugs
crawling around, did you?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.600
No.
No?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.810
What is it with you guys?
Can't a girl just be happy?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.604
Of course you can. It's just,
um... it's just, um...

02:25.604 --> 02:28.607
Unexpected.
It's unexpected.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.652
No. Nope. Nothing is putting me
in a bad mood today because

02:32.652 --> 02:34.279
today is the day
that I figure out

02:34.279 --> 02:36.073
the one thing
we have left to worry about--

02:36.073 --> 02:37.741
why the monsters
are still coming.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.409
How are we gonna
figure that out?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.411
Well, you are gonna help
Dr. Saltzman with research

02:41.411 --> 02:46.541
while Cleo and I are going
to get some quality roomie time.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.133
Lizzie.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.885
What are you doing here?
You scared me.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.637
You forgot your sweater.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.889
I thought you might need it
after the ice-cold way

03:00.889 --> 03:02.766
that you violated twin code.

03:02.766 --> 03:06.019
Oh, here we go.
You have a crush, and you told

03:06.019 --> 03:07.479
our father before
telling me.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.980
'Cause it's already over.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.275
I made things weird
and I can't un-weird them.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.236
That's because, sweetie--
and I love you--

03:14.236 --> 03:15.654
but you have zero game.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.115
What you do have,
however, is a sister

03:18.115 --> 03:20.492
with magical powers
and an encyclopedic knowledge

03:20.492 --> 03:23.745
of every rom-com ever.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.163
I'm here to help.

03:25.163 --> 03:28.500
No, Lizzie.
I beg of you, please,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.377
let me fix this on my own.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.671
Finch is a completely
normal human.

03:32.671 --> 03:36.758
I want to fix this
the regular way, without magic.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.802
Just promise me.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.720
Lizzie.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.265
So great to see you.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.060
What's up?
We have a monster problem?

03:47.060 --> 03:49.813
Oh, it is way worse,
Mr. Williams. We have

03:49.813 --> 03:53.275
an angsty, teenage, high school,
impossible crush problem.

03:53.275 --> 03:57.028
Right, right, that, uh...
that-that is worse, and, um...

03:57.028 --> 03:59.489
thankfully, not my department.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.533
So best of luck
to you both.

04:01.533 --> 04:05.370
That's actually totally okay,
'cause Lizzie was just leaving.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.205
Everything alone.
Mm.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.541
Right, Lizzie?
Perfect. Awesome.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.209
Love you.
Uh...

04:21.511 --> 04:23.346
Invisique.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.609
Well, well, well.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.861
Heard you might've
had a late night

04:37.861 --> 04:41.239
doing totally normal,
completely unheroic things.

04:41.239 --> 04:45.327
Um... keep it down, E.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.871
What are we doing
next? Any leads?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.873
Um...

04:49.873 --> 04:53.585
I was thinking
we could just lay low.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.545
But yesterday
was awesome.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.422
I want to do it again.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.799
And this way

04:59.799 --> 05:02.385
you won't have to compel people
all the time.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.679
You can keep your
identity a secret.

05:04.679 --> 05:08.391
You'll look... Blur-some.
Mm-hmm.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.437
First of all,

05:12.437 --> 05:14.898
do not ever say that terrible

05:14.898 --> 05:18.193
superhero name
to me ever again.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.071
Second, we just
got lucky last night.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.990
Mystic Falls barely has
one robbery a decade.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.367
Yeah, that we know about.

05:26.743 --> 05:30.121
My mom's old police scanner.

05:30.121 --> 05:31.289
I figure,
if I'm your human sidekick,

05:31.289 --> 05:32.582
the least I can do is

05:32.582 --> 05:34.000
help you find our next case.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.504
Do you want to skip P.E.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.423
and bring down Mystic
Falls' vast underworld

05:40.423 --> 05:41.716
of petty criminals?

05:43.969 --> 05:46.763
Or am I the only one
that had fun yesterday?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.559
Yeah, you're right.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.870
Thanks.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.085
So... you're back.

06:17.085 --> 06:21.047
Yeah. All that drama at my
old school is completely done.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.967
I'm just focusing
on the now.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.095
Making myself open

06:27.095 --> 06:31.516
and available to anything
or, you know, whatever.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.977
Does that
whatever include

06:33.977 --> 06:35.729
staying on campus for lunch?

06:35.729 --> 06:36.730
I'd love that.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.858
I'll be there. Here.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.110
For lunch. Yeah.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.486
Then maybe I'll see you.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.697
Yeah, cool.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.702
I totally get it.
She's hot.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.329
Lizzie?

06:52.329 --> 06:54.372
I told you
that you needed my help.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.794
Stop it.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.298
You knocked away my books?

07:03.298 --> 07:06.968
It's called a "meet-cute,"
my young Padawan, rom-com 101.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.179
And step one is now
officially complete.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.930
Well, what's step number two?

07:10.930 --> 07:13.975
Don't look so worried,
and I'll be happy to tell you.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.479
Stand up straight.
Chin up.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.022
There. Much better.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.569
You're gonna get
the girl for sure.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.822
This is so cool.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.076
You said Rasputin, Napoleon
and Einstein

07:31.076 --> 07:32.202
all held this thing?

07:32.202 --> 07:35.455
And Queen Elizabeth I.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.749
What? How far back
does this go?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.459
That's what we have
to find out.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.378
Monsters started appearing
after Hope opened it,

07:41.378 --> 07:43.338
so my theory is,
they're connected.

07:43.338 --> 07:44.631
But first we just
have to figure out

07:44.631 --> 07:46.091
where it originated.

07:46.091 --> 07:49.552
Um, Dr. Saltzman,
not that I'm not thrilled

07:49.552 --> 07:53.056
to be on Team Library.
I am-- it's nice to be useful,

07:53.056 --> 07:55.016
especially since I can't even be
monster bait anymore--

07:55.016 --> 07:57.435
but it kind of feels like
a vampire would be able

07:57.435 --> 07:59.938
to look through these books
a lot faster than me.

07:59.938 --> 08:03.692
Maybe I just like your company.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.235
Mm-hmm.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.614
So why the crossbow?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.248
Okay.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.083
Hope asked me to
keep an eye on you

08:20.083 --> 08:21.668
and make sure you're safe
while she's testing out

08:21.668 --> 08:23.211
her new theory.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.547
What theory?

08:25.547 --> 08:29.008
This was your great idea?

08:29.008 --> 08:32.262
Consider it a brainstorming
session... with brie.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.305
I must say, you seem
rather relaxed

08:34.305 --> 08:36.266
about our lives being in danger.

08:36.266 --> 08:40.186
Perhaps if you had been the one
at the bottom of that well...

08:40.186 --> 08:42.272
Actually, that was sort of what
I wanted to talk to you about.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.649
We've been assuming
that the gremlin

08:44.649 --> 08:45.900
just happened to grab you,

08:45.900 --> 08:47.402
but what if it wasn't random?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.696
What if you're
what Malivore wants?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.282
Why would he want me?
No clue.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
Next step would be
testing my theory.

08:54.284 --> 08:56.244
Hmm, and how would we
test that?

08:56.244 --> 08:59.205
Well, first we'd have
to use you as bait

08:59.205 --> 09:01.833
to see if it would happen again,
if you're willing, that is.

09:01.833 --> 09:05.462
But don't worry, I'd be there
to keep you safe the whole time.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.840
We'd just have to lower
the perimeter spells

09:08.840 --> 09:11.843
and pretend like we're
having a good time.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.803
You know, sort of like...

09:13.803 --> 09:15.597
What we are doing right now.

09:15.597 --> 09:18.349
Don't be mad,
we can totally stop.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.894
I just figured you might need
a little bit of a push.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.353
And if we can get
a talking monster,

09:22.353 --> 09:23.605
we might actually get
some answers.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.356
What do you say?

09:25.356 --> 09:30.028
You lead me into very strange
situations, Hope Mikaelson.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.450
Fine. But why a picnic?

09:35.450 --> 09:37.702
I mean, I figured if one of us
is gonna be used as bait,

09:37.702 --> 09:39.579
we might as well enjoy it.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.080
Besides, not all the monsters
are that bad.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.584
One of them was even
sort of... whimsical.

09:56.971 --> 09:58.556
That didn't take long.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.266
Here.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.520
This one doesn't feel
very whimsical.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.694
It might not be as bad
as it seems.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.450
Probably as bad as it seems.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.457
Corrupan vinea.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.090
Foolish girls.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.601
Oo ni le soro.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.277
Good thing you were here
to keep me safe.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.154
At least we know the monsters
are definitely after you.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.532
Now we just have
to find out why.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.040
What's with the lights?

11:11.040 --> 11:14.090
She's a walking horror movie.
That's awesome.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.590
What is she?

11:16.590 --> 11:18.090
Besides some creepy chick

11:18.090 --> 11:20.170
putting a damper
on my positivity, no clue.

11:20.170 --> 11:22.300
Either way, I owe Gaby
some money.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.760
I had a wendigo
in the monster pool.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.010
Rookie mistake.

11:26.010 --> 11:27.520
It's never a wendigo.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.100
But we still should be
able to get answers.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.310
She talks, right?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.480
Not exactly.

11:33.480 --> 11:37.610
I recommend covering
your ears.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.460
Dr. S, I think,
I think she's...

11:52.460 --> 11:54.210
A banshee.

11:54.210 --> 11:55.750
Okay, well, how
do we get answers

11:55.750 --> 11:57.500
out of a banshee
without our brains melting?

11:57.500 --> 11:59.670
Don't know.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.590
Until we figure that out,
she's not going anywhere.

12:06.260 --> 12:09.390
Well, we have all the time
in the world, right?

12:15.690 --> 12:17.900
I'm sure you're wondering
what happens next.

12:17.900 --> 12:22.030
you need to sneak out
of a bad party together.

12:22.030 --> 12:25.990
I call this the "You want to
get out of here?" moment.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.490
That's really specific.

12:27.490 --> 12:28.870
Step three.
We can skip this one.

12:28.870 --> 12:31.200
It involves a missing pet

12:31.200 --> 12:33.960
or some sort of
non-life-threatening emergency.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.130
But step four, this is where
the real fireworks happen.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.920
The spontaneous life highlight.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.010
I'm talking night swimming.
I'm talking impromptu road trip.

12:42.010 --> 12:43.380
I'm talking...

12:43.380 --> 12:44.970
Moonlit dance in the parking lot

12:44.970 --> 12:47.220
during an actual
school dance.

12:47.220 --> 12:49.640
I thought you said
this wasn't your department.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.390
They're painting my office.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.180
At least someone gets it.

12:53.180 --> 12:56.520
If we can just get to
step four, it's automatic.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.110
She will have no choice
but to fall for you.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.650
Well, I don't want
to manipulate Finch.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.990
I want her to actually like me.

13:03.990 --> 13:06.070
Never gonna happen.

13:07.030 --> 13:08.950
Why not?

13:08.950 --> 13:12.620
'Cause that would require you
to actually shoot your shot.

13:12.620 --> 13:15.500
Well, then, I'll ask her out
on a real date.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.790
Tonight.

13:28.050 --> 13:30.050
extroverted sister
provokes

13:30.050 --> 13:33.020
introverted sister
out of her comfort zone.

13:34.310 --> 13:35.480
Our little secret.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.480
It's good.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.940
Do werewolves just
work out anywhere?

13:46.070 --> 13:47.660
No.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.910
I just came up here
'cause the gym was occupied by

13:49.910 --> 13:51.950
whatever that thing is.

13:51.950 --> 13:55.700
She is a banshee,
or so I am told.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.040
Well, I just lost 20 bucks.

13:58.040 --> 13:59.630
Totally had wendigo.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.670
Apparently, it's
never a wendigo.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.960
I wouldn't know.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.880
I've been relegated
to the Junior Squad

14:05.880 --> 14:07.930
ever since I...
Hurt MG?

14:09.010 --> 14:11.720
I heard.
Yeah. Everyone has.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.680
I keep thinking I'll find a way
to make it up to all them.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.640
And you will.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.110
Why are you up here?

14:22.110 --> 14:23.940
I am supposed to be
researching

14:23.940 --> 14:25.900
how to allow
the banshee to speak

14:25.900 --> 14:28.860
without using her mouth, but...

14:28.860 --> 14:31.450
I just found out that

14:31.450 --> 14:33.910
the monsters are coming here
because of me.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.290
I needed a moment
to process that.

14:38.290 --> 14:40.420
Because if you can't get
the monster to talk,

14:40.420 --> 14:43.590
you can't figure out
why they... want you.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.210
Are you all right?

14:47.210 --> 14:48.720
Something just came over me.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.220
I think I know how we can

14:50.220 --> 14:52.430
solve both our problems
at the same time.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.070
All the good stuff
must happen at night, right?

15:10.780 --> 15:14.410
You know what this
mission needs? Snacks.

15:14.410 --> 15:17.040
Every stakeout involves
cheap snacks and coffee.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.330
Ethan...

15:20.330 --> 15:21.920
I dig the enthusiasm.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.210
I really do.

15:24.210 --> 15:26.710
But, you know,
we can just hang out

15:26.710 --> 15:28.800
without it having to be
a mission.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.180
Except now I know that
superhuman vampires exist.

15:33.930 --> 15:36.350
It's pretty hard to go back
to normal life after that.

15:37.510 --> 15:39.980
I mean, think about it.
If you exist,

15:39.980 --> 15:41.270
then what else is out there?

15:41.270 --> 15:43.850
Maybe there's an
evil version of you.

15:43.850 --> 15:45.060
A superpowered bad guy

15:45.060 --> 15:46.650
just waiting to attack

15:46.650 --> 15:48.360
and your destinies are
bound to intersect,

15:48.360 --> 15:49.990
so whenever

15:49.990 --> 15:53.360
he or she shows up,
we have to be ready.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.660
Well, until they do...

15:56.660 --> 15:58.370
I'm gonna head to class.

15:58.370 --> 16:01.370
Cool. I'll just, uh, let
you know if I hear anything.

16:02.500 --> 16:06.250
Are you sure you don't
want to come with?
Yeah.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.920
After everything else that's
happened this year, it's...

16:09.920 --> 16:12.590
it's just nice to have
something to care about.

16:12.590 --> 16:14.050
You know?

16:22.100 --> 16:25.650
Okay, so what kind of,
uh, stakeout snacks

16:25.650 --> 16:27.310
are we talking about here?

16:27.310 --> 16:29.400
I know that look.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.150
Why don't you just
tell me what's wrong?

16:31.150 --> 16:33.280
Because you're
in a good mood.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.660
Let me guess.
A banshee can only be stopped

16:35.660 --> 16:37.280
with a certain enchanted
blah, blah, blah

16:37.280 --> 16:39.200
from the mountains
of blah, blah, blah.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.290
Look, we always find a way
to stop the monster.

16:41.290 --> 16:43.210
I'm sure I can handle it.

16:43.210 --> 16:46.170
According to Irish mythology,
the banshee is a harbinger.

16:46.170 --> 16:50.000
Whenever they appear,
death is not far behind.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.710
Okay, that just means
that death could be coming

16:51.710 --> 16:53.420
for anybody in Mystic Falls.

16:53.420 --> 16:55.430
And when has that
ever been our luck?

16:55.430 --> 16:57.510
Hope, we have to
prepare ourselves

16:57.510 --> 16:59.680
for the very real possibility
that she may say something to us

16:59.680 --> 17:01.140
we don't want to hear.

17:01.140 --> 17:02.980
Dr. Saltzman?

17:05.310 --> 17:07.770
Cleo and I know how
to get this monster to talk.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.450
Here's the spell.
Alias Vocem.

17:14.450 --> 17:18.200
It allows one to speak
through another as a conduit,

17:18.200 --> 17:20.870
without being able
to burst our eardrums.

17:22.660 --> 17:24.000
It's brilliant.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.660
You thought of this?

17:25.660 --> 17:27.500
Yeah, I know, right?

17:28.540 --> 17:30.750
Oh, but I know what's missing!
Wait, wait.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.880
You all right?

17:33.880 --> 17:37.130
Ask me in a few moments.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.930
Hope, we're ready.

17:44.270 --> 17:46.520
I found it.
Blue Calamus.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.400
Josie told me it's
basically a truth weed.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.360
If we give it to Jed,
the banshee can't lie to us.

17:52.610 --> 17:54.190
Well done, Team Library.

17:54.190 --> 17:55.900
There's not much time
till the full moon.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.530
When Jed turns, we don't
want a monster in his head.

17:58.530 --> 17:59.910
Yeah.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.910
Well, now we just need
something of hers.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.420
Vauntidictus calimus vox.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.230
Ah.

18:31.230 --> 18:33.150
Clever girl.

18:33.150 --> 18:35.150
Trapping my voice
in a body

18:35.150 --> 18:36.280
that cannot scream.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.780
Or lie.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.200
Now we can have
a civilized conversation.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.080
Are you sure you want to hear
what I have to say?

18:45.540 --> 18:47.250
Why are you here?

18:47.250 --> 18:51.250
Malivore promised me
freedom from the darkness

18:51.250 --> 18:54.920
in exchange for
bringing him that girl.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.380
And why does he want her?

19:00.550 --> 19:03.350
You are forcing me
to tell the truth...

19:05.140 --> 19:07.220
...but that does not mean
I have to answer.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.650
This is not the question
that troubles you.

19:14.940 --> 19:16.650
Go on, little girl.

19:17.610 --> 19:19.900
Ask what you really wish
to know.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.120
Who's gonna die?

19:33.380 --> 19:35.710
There are many possible roads.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.920
But one is clearer than
the others.

19:41.340 --> 19:43.140
If she stays here...

19:44.140 --> 19:45.550
...he dies.

20:25.970 --> 20:28.300
Wow, tea twice in one day.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.390
Hope, can we talk about...

20:30.390 --> 20:33.140
There's no need to.
It's not happening.

20:33.140 --> 20:34.850
No one's dying today.

20:34.850 --> 20:36.650
The banshee does not agree.

20:36.650 --> 20:39.690
I know you're new here, but
there's always a loophole, okay?

20:39.690 --> 20:42.360
It's basically our school motto.
We'll find it.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.360
Mm. If you are so confidant,
then why did you

20:45.360 --> 20:47.160
spell Landon into his room?

20:50.200 --> 20:52.290
I think it is time
that we talked.

21:08.180 --> 21:09.350
You made it.

21:09.350 --> 21:10.970
You guys, this is Josie...

21:10.970 --> 21:12.350
I know that there's been
weird energy between us

21:12.350 --> 21:13.930
since the first moment
I saw you.

21:13.930 --> 21:15.890
And then things got weirder
when I bailed on you.

21:15.890 --> 21:17.730
But it's not because
I'm not into you, because I am

21:17.730 --> 21:19.900
into you, I'm just cautious,

21:19.900 --> 21:22.190
because I usually
mess things like this up

21:22.190 --> 21:23.820
and I really don't
want to mess this up.

21:23.820 --> 21:26.610
And you're hot, okay?

21:26.610 --> 21:28.700
And worse, you're also
really cool, and that's scary,

21:28.700 --> 21:31.330
because I think that if we
became a thing, it would be...

21:31.330 --> 21:32.910
a thing.

21:32.910 --> 21:35.160
But I like you. I like you
in a way that I haven't

21:35.160 --> 21:36.750
liked somebody
in a really long time.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.250
So I think that we should
give this a shot.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.500
So, do you, maybe,
want to hang out...

21:43.840 --> 21:45.460
...tonight?

21:48.680 --> 21:50.760
I...

21:50.760 --> 21:53.310
can't tonight.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.770
Got plans.

21:54.770 --> 21:56.850
Uh, yeah.
That's totally understandable.

21:56.850 --> 21:58.440
Um, short notice.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.150
Uh, tomorrow night, then, maybe?

22:00.150 --> 22:02.190
Tomorrow might be bad, too.

22:04.360 --> 22:05.990
Sorry.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.080
For a long time,
I searched for

22:16.080 --> 22:17.540
a place like this.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.540
A place to call home.

22:19.540 --> 22:22.750
But I cannot be the reason that
trouble comes into your lives.

22:22.750 --> 22:25.500
Which is why I need to go.
You don't have to.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.090
The monsters are always
coming after someone.

22:27.090 --> 22:28.720
We've never made anyone
leave because of it.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.300
But is that what you want?

22:30.300 --> 22:31.840
Be honest.

22:31.840 --> 22:33.970
Would you be happier if I left?
Yes.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.390
I didn't mean that.
You did.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.770
Because truth weed
can also be used to make tea.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.700
No.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.620
She said she had plans,

23:00.620 --> 23:04.170
which didn't even involve
coming up with a good excuse.

23:04.170 --> 23:06.050
Obviously just means that...

23:06.050 --> 23:07.460
She's seeing someone else.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.010
You were right.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.840
I waited too long.

23:12.840 --> 23:17.060
Or we're just in a slightly
different rom-com now,

23:17.060 --> 23:20.020
the "steal her back from
less worthy competition" story.

23:20.020 --> 23:22.270
Don't worry, it's
a total classic,

23:22.270 --> 23:24.190
and there's usually a really
great music moment, so...

23:24.190 --> 23:25.480
Lizzie.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.030
I know.

23:28.030 --> 23:30.110
You wanted to do this
the "natural way."

23:30.110 --> 23:35.030
Actually, I kind of just want
to know who she's seeing

23:35.030 --> 23:36.780
and if it's serious.

23:36.780 --> 23:41.620
So you mean, like,
if someone could do some magic?

23:43.040 --> 23:45.460
Invisible spying?

23:46.670 --> 23:49.760
Go home.
I'll find out how serious it is.

23:58.850 --> 24:00.980
I think I know
how I can help you.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.730
Legend says

24:02.730 --> 24:05.860
that a banshee is a demon
drawn to inconsolable grief.

24:05.860 --> 24:08.480
That they seek out women
who've died of a broken heart

24:08.480 --> 24:09.860
and possess them.

24:11.820 --> 24:14.530
The person that you once were
is still in there.

24:14.530 --> 24:17.030
You are not this thing.

24:18.870 --> 24:20.950
Tell us why he wants Cleo,
and we will find a way

24:20.950 --> 24:22.250
to set you free.

24:22.250 --> 24:24.080
It's no use trying to talk

24:24.080 --> 24:25.750
to the human woman.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.170
She won't believe you.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.630
After her child was taken,

24:29.630 --> 24:32.050
no one could tell her
what happened to it.

24:32.050 --> 24:36.390
No one could heal
the hole in her heart.

24:36.390 --> 24:38.390
She was abandoned
by everyone--

24:38.390 --> 24:41.180
her village, her husband.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.640
They couldn't stand
to hear her cries.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.520
They fled from her grief.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.520
That's when I found her.

24:51.900 --> 24:56.110
She knows you will be
no different than anyone else.

24:56.110 --> 24:58.160
Humans run from grief
like a sickness...

25:00.080 --> 25:01.830
...afraid that
it will spread,

25:01.830 --> 25:04.000
that they will catch it.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.960
Oh, it is their nature.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.330
I'm not like everyone else.

25:09.630 --> 25:11.710
But you are out of time.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.460
The full moon rises...

25:14.470 --> 25:16.550
...and this body
is about to turn.

25:18.760 --> 25:21.390
I've never felt such strength.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.060
Cleo left.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.230
I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.350
What's going on?

25:28.350 --> 25:29.860
We need to unlink Jed

25:29.860 --> 25:31.610
from the banshee
before he turns.

25:31.610 --> 25:33.150
Pondas.

25:39.410 --> 25:41.120
Hope, what's wrong?

25:41.120 --> 25:42.240
I just need to know.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.750
Now that Cleo's gone,
is Landon safe?

25:47.750 --> 25:49.040
No.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.830
Don't listen to her.
I am bound

25:50.830 --> 25:52.130
to tell the truth,
remember?

25:53.250 --> 25:55.920
I was not sent to capture Cleo.

25:57.090 --> 25:59.340
I was sent to drive her away
from your protection.

26:02.850 --> 26:06.060
One road darkens,
the other grows clearer.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.110
Cleo dies, too.

26:24.580 --> 26:26.290
Where you going?

26:27.290 --> 26:29.080
Cleo cloaked herself
from my locator spell,

26:29.080 --> 26:30.750
so I'm gonna have to find
her the old-fashioned way.

26:30.750 --> 26:32.380
And before you
try to stop me,

26:32.380 --> 26:34.750
I just wanted to say
that I'm... I'm sorry.

26:34.750 --> 26:36.630
I'm sorry that
it apparently

26:36.630 --> 26:38.090
always has to be
this way for us.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.420
We can never just be happy.

26:39.420 --> 26:40.800
But I can't
let her die

26:40.800 --> 26:42.430
when I'm the one
that sent her away.

26:42.430 --> 26:44.350
I know.

26:44.350 --> 26:46.970
I think you'll want these
when you find her.

26:47.850 --> 26:50.100
A bag of clothes?

26:50.100 --> 26:52.060
You don't need
a locator spell.

26:52.060 --> 26:53.810
You're a wolf.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.110
Hold on, we're almost there!

27:03.160 --> 27:04.820
Dr. Saltzman...

27:04.820 --> 27:06.780
when she was
inside my head,

27:06.780 --> 27:08.910
making me do things...

27:08.910 --> 27:10.660
All right, let's just worry
about you right now, okay, Jed?

27:11.660 --> 27:13.370
I think I saw something.

27:13.370 --> 27:15.710
A memory.
I-I think I know her name.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.510
DISPATCHER
Nearby units, 10-33.

27:25.510 --> 27:28.100
Possible alarm trip
at Mystic Falls High.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.310
Uh, copy that.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.770
Probably a false alarm.

27:30.770 --> 27:32.640
Happens about once a month.

27:34.850 --> 27:36.310
It's go time.
Hey, hold on, hold on.

27:36.310 --> 27:37.820
You heard them.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.570
They said it's probably
a false alarm.

27:39.570 --> 27:41.490
Or it's what I've
been talking about.

27:41.490 --> 27:43.150
Another powerful creature.

27:43.150 --> 27:45.530
I've seen my mom's files.
Our high school has

27:45.530 --> 27:48.080
a weird history
of unexplained events.

27:49.450 --> 27:51.500
Then I'll go.

27:51.500 --> 27:54.460
I'm sorry,
but you said it yourself.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.630
You're just a human sidekick.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.780
Who's there?

28:27.410 --> 28:29.580
I can smell you.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.620
Invisique saeclum.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.330
I-I'm sorry.

28:34.330 --> 28:36.080
I didn't know that you were
a werewolf. I thought...

28:36.080 --> 28:38.000
Who are you?
Uh, it's complicated.

28:41.460 --> 28:42.960
You came here to turn.
I'll help you.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.970
No. Run!

29:05.740 --> 29:07.450
Please tell me Dorian
has at least one

29:07.450 --> 29:08.610
magical object in this...

29:08.610 --> 29:10.240
Very funny.

29:28.510 --> 29:29.760
Lizzie?

29:29.760 --> 29:30.890
What the hell
are you doing here?

29:30.890 --> 29:32.640
I was able to lure it away.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.270
Werewolves are always gonna
chase vampires first.

29:34.270 --> 29:35.680
You have to get out of here.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.850
We're getting out of here.

29:37.850 --> 29:39.810
You take the back exit.
I'll lure it out the front.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.770
MG, I...

29:42.770 --> 29:44.190
Go.

30:21.270 --> 30:24.610
I know your instincts

30:24.610 --> 30:27.070
are telling you
to bite me right now,

30:27.070 --> 30:28.740
but you can fight it.

30:45.630 --> 30:48.510
We don't have to hurt
each other.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.660
Not bad for a sidekick, huh?

31:42.480 --> 31:45.480
I know who you were
before you died.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.940
Kaelan.

31:48.610 --> 31:50.650
My Old Irish is a little rusty,

31:50.650 --> 31:53.030
but this is
from the Clan Kinelarty.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.400
From the year 1014.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.740
Very good,
but you're too late.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.130
I know what happened
to your son!

32:13.170 --> 32:14.920
What did you say?

32:14.920 --> 32:16.590
Your son.

32:17.970 --> 32:19.510
Drystan.

32:19.510 --> 32:21.970
The one they took from you.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.350
Don't listen to him. He's lying!

32:24.350 --> 32:26.190
How old was he when
the English took him

32:26.190 --> 32:27.350
from you to fight
in their wars?

32:27.350 --> 32:29.190
11? 12?

32:29.190 --> 32:31.320
And you never knew
what happened to him.

32:31.320 --> 32:33.400
No, don't listen!
He survived.

32:34.570 --> 32:36.780
He survived the battle.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.950
Tell me!

32:39.950 --> 32:42.790
There was a survey done
in England 50 years later

32:42.790 --> 32:44.450
called the Domesday Book.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.330
He's here.

32:47.330 --> 32:49.330
Living in a small village.

32:49.330 --> 32:51.540
Drystan... Kinelarty.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.420
He lived a long time, too.
Look.

32:54.420 --> 32:55.880
Just below his name,
he had...

32:55.880 --> 32:57.680
Children.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.720
Grandchildren.

33:00.970 --> 33:02.720
One of them was named after you.

33:06.020 --> 33:07.480
I'm so sorry.

33:07.480 --> 33:11.730
I can only imagine
if somebody took my child

33:11.730 --> 33:13.530
and I never knew
what happened to them.

33:14.690 --> 33:17.570
They shouldn't have left you
to grieve like that.

33:17.570 --> 33:20.780
No one should have to grieve
alone like that.

33:32.460 --> 33:34.500
Thank you.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.880
You can sleep now.

33:38.930 --> 33:41.970
I know why Malivore wants Cleo.

34:20.430 --> 34:22.970
You just gave me
a weapon, buddy.

34:40.030 --> 34:42.110
Hope, thank you.

34:42.110 --> 34:45.870
Like I said,
nobody's dying today.

34:47.370 --> 34:49.250
Let's get you home.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.250
I suppose it was
a good thing

34:55.250 --> 34:57.090
you were there
to keep me safe.

34:57.090 --> 34:59.050
After I put you
in danger.

34:59.050 --> 35:03.010
Look, what I said before.

35:03.010 --> 35:07.050
It was true that was how I felt,
but it's not the whole truth.

35:07.550 --> 35:09.350
I know I've
been distracted

35:09.350 --> 35:12.730
and-and not in the best of
moods since you got here,

35:12.730 --> 35:14.190
but that has nothing
to do with you.

35:14.190 --> 35:16.060
Because the truth
is that you are

35:16.060 --> 35:17.980
a kind and brilliant badass,

35:17.980 --> 35:20.360
and I'm lucky to have you
as my friend.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.860
As far as I'm concerned,
this is your home.

35:22.860 --> 35:24.740
No matter what.

35:26.740 --> 35:28.870
Even if it brings danger?

35:28.870 --> 35:30.330
We're kind of used to that
around here.

35:31.950 --> 35:34.290
And what of that creature?

35:34.290 --> 35:36.170
It must be working for Malivore.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.090
Our monster problem
is multiplying.

35:39.090 --> 35:41.510
Why do you think it ran away?

35:41.510 --> 35:44.130
I don't know, but...

35:44.130 --> 35:46.390
something about it
felt familiar.

35:46.390 --> 35:48.970
Almost like
I've fought it before.

35:55.980 --> 35:58.190
Werewolves.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.820
Who knew, right?

35:59.820 --> 36:01.820
I did kind of call it.

36:01.820 --> 36:04.320
I mean, it was no
supervillain, but...

36:04.320 --> 36:06.570
that thing was pretty
scary either way.

36:06.570 --> 36:08.990
I get why you wanted
me to stay behind.

36:08.990 --> 36:10.830
I'd be dead if you had.

36:10.830 --> 36:13.080
And then I never would've saw
this sweet hero base

36:13.080 --> 36:14.870
you've been working on.

36:14.870 --> 36:17.250
That's what sidekicks

36:17.250 --> 36:20.630
♪ Oh, the sidewalks shimmer

36:20.630 --> 36:22.920

36:26.010 --> 36:28.180
But I'm gonna need you
to go ahead

36:28.180 --> 36:29.970
and make another one
of those janky masks.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.810
I have a feeling
you're gonna need it.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.680
Partner.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.360
I'm gonna need a superhero name.

36:44.360 --> 36:47.030
Now I will handle
the hero names, all right?

36:47.030 --> 36:49.490
Okay.

36:49.490 --> 36:51.530
Uh, first things first, partner.

36:53.240 --> 36:55.250

37:19.650 --> 37:21.610

And it's really serious.

get your heart broken.

37:33.620 --> 37:35.290
That's okay.

37:50.590 --> 37:53.390
maybe you...

37:53.390 --> 37:55.390
didn't need me anymore.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.640

He's dead.

38:43.900 --> 38:46.400
The rest of us actually
have to work to be positive.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.440
Now I feel so much pressure,
you know?

38:48.440 --> 38:50.360
Like I have to be happy
no matter what.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.030
Like, I'm afraid that if...

38:52.030 --> 38:55.070
The happiness went away,
it might never come back?

39:11.170 --> 39:13.470
And screw fate, you know?

39:13.470 --> 39:15.640
Screw fate.

39:28.110 --> 39:30.530
Dr. Saltzman told
me what happened.

39:30.530 --> 39:32.530
Your plan worked.

39:32.530 --> 39:33.950
Seriously?

39:33.950 --> 39:35.780
You underestimate yourself.

39:35.780 --> 39:38.280
Because of you, the
banshee found peace.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.700
And you have reclaimed

39:39.700 --> 39:41.700
your rightful place
in the Squad.

39:41.700 --> 39:43.580
Thanks for believing in me.

39:46.290 --> 39:48.500
When you were inside her mind,

39:48.500 --> 39:51.000
did you discover
why Malivore wants me?

39:51.000 --> 39:52.670
Not right away.

39:52.670 --> 39:54.010
It was kind
of hazy.

39:54.010 --> 39:55.880
I didn't understand
what it meant,

39:55.880 --> 39:57.720
but now I think I get it.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.810
Because I have literally

39:59.810 --> 40:02.310
never had
a genius monster-hunting idea

40:02.310 --> 40:04.520
until I was standing
next to you.

40:09.520 --> 40:12.860
This part of the job
I did not miss.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.400
To Kaelan.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.540
And now...

40:23.540 --> 40:25.660
it's your turn with this thing.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.500
Oh, you still don't know
where it came from, huh?

40:27.500 --> 40:30.420
No, but today's
still a win.

40:30.420 --> 40:32.840
We know why Malivore's
after Cleo.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.800
She's a Muse.

40:34.800 --> 40:37.380
A Muse?

40:37.380 --> 40:39.720
Like inspiration muse?

40:39.720 --> 40:41.810
A witch
who's the seventh daughter

40:41.810 --> 40:43.770
of a seventh daughter

40:43.770 --> 40:46.640
has a special magical power,
the power...

40:46.640 --> 40:48.100
of inspiration.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.940
Why does Malivore
need inspiration?

40:50.940 --> 40:52.980
He has a problem
he needs to solve.

40:52.980 --> 40:55.190
If I had to guess,

40:55.190 --> 40:58.070
he's looking for a way
out of the prison world.
