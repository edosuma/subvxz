WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:03.786
[Mike] Previously on "Mike & Molly.."

00:03.873 --> 00:05.614
What about just having
a traditional church wedding?

00:05.701 --> 00:07.572
Oh, Mike's mom would love it
if we got married in a church

00:07.659 --> 00:10.706
so we won't be doing that.

00:10.793 --> 00:12.534
[male #1]
'I just need to confirm
a couple of things.'

00:12.621 --> 00:14.492
Your commitment to the church
and that you're planning on

00:14.579 --> 00:16.016
raising your children Catholic.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.669
Can't guarantee what path
they're gonna take

00:17.756 --> 00:19.758
or that they'll go
to church every Sunday.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.326
How the hell
did you lose the church?

00:22.413 --> 00:24.676
Did you take a whore bath
in the holy water?

00:24.763 --> 00:27.027
I know it's kind of cliche,
but I was thinking

00:27.114 --> 00:29.855
honeymooning in Paris
could be really romantic.

00:29.942 --> 00:32.249
Paris, France?

00:32.336 --> 00:34.599
So what's the problem?
You afraid of flying?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.688
No, but when I'm traveling,
I like knowing

00:36.775 --> 00:38.299
that if there's trouble,
I can jump out of a window

00:38.386 --> 00:40.040
without plummeting to my death.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.867
Looks like we might need
to let this out just a smidge.

00:41.954 --> 00:44.609
No, you won't. I am just a few
pounds from my target weight.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.264
And when I set a goal
for myself, I-I reach it.

00:47.351 --> 00:49.440
Two and a half miles.
Pretty good.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.702
Tomorrow we'll go for three.

00:50.789 --> 00:52.574
Move up and down
and lift with your core.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.271
Stop. Stop.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.578
Son of a bitch!

00:56.665 --> 00:58.580
You don't have to squeeze
into some wedding dress

00:58.667 --> 01:00.408
to look perfect to me.

01:00.495 --> 01:03.498
You're already the most
beautiful woman in the world.

01:03.585 --> 01:06.936
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:07.023 --> 01:09.330
I promise to cherish
every moment with you.

01:09.417 --> 01:13.073
Molly Flynn, I love you,
and every moment of my life

01:13.160 --> 01:15.945
has meaning because I do.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.903
And by the power vested in me

01:17.990 --> 01:20.689
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:21.907 --> 01:24.214
You may kiss the bride.

01:24.301 --> 01:26.434
[cheering and applauding]

01:26.521 --> 01:28.131
[instrumental music]

01:38.707 --> 01:41.101
[grunts]
For the love of God.

01:44.408 --> 01:46.845
Mike! A little help in here!

01:46.932 --> 01:48.369
Come on.

01:50.153 --> 01:51.459
Damn it.

01:53.939 --> 01:57.769
What's in here?

01:57.856 --> 02:00.468
Ah! Son of a bitch
is smuggling cheese

02:00.555 --> 02:03.123
and settin' me up
to take the fall.

02:03.210 --> 02:06.038
[Mike singing gibberish]

02:10.086 --> 02:11.870
Smuggling perishables
is a crime

02:11.957 --> 02:13.959
and you're a police officer,
and you should know that.

02:14.046 --> 02:16.223
The real crime is you can't get
this kind of fromage

02:16.310 --> 02:17.311
back in the States.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.703
This is the best
I've ever tasted

02:18.790 --> 02:22.316
and I have been to Cheddar Fest
in Wisconsin.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.448
Yeah, I know, you brought me
back a T-shirt that said

02:24.535 --> 02:25.971
What a friend
we have in cheeses.

02:26.058 --> 02:27.408
I'm puttin' them in your bag.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.236
Fine, just be careful
of the ham.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.586
I knew I smelled ham.

02:31.673 --> 02:34.371
Come on, get up
and help me finish packing.

02:34.458 --> 02:38.201
Oh, you Americans,
always hustling and bustling.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.508
You need to learn to carpe
a little more diem.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.032
Yeah, you need to get your
derriere out of that chair

02:43.119 --> 02:44.599
and get your traveling duds on.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.514
And shave off
that hideous mustache.

02:46.601 --> 02:49.691
What? You want me to get rid
of my French tickler?

02:49.778 --> 02:51.083
Oui.

02:52.476 --> 02:54.391
But this is who I am now.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.524
[French accent]
A bon vivant world traveler.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.439
Paris Mike.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.268
Fine, but if I have to keep
kissing that cookie duster

03:01.355 --> 03:04.662
I'm going full on French,
legs and armpits.

03:04.749 --> 03:05.837
Sacre bleu.

03:05.924 --> 03:08.144
[laughs]

03:08.231 --> 03:09.580
Alright, fine, it's gone

03:09.667 --> 03:11.626
but, uh, perhaps one last tickle

03:11.713 --> 03:15.020
before we say au revoir
to our little fuzzy friend?

03:15.107 --> 03:17.153
What are you talking about,
like a quick kiss goodbye

03:17.240 --> 03:19.111
or skirt over
the head kind of thing?

03:19.199 --> 03:22.985
[French accent]
Let us start with a kiss
and see where the winds

03:23.072 --> 03:25.466
of love blow us.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.642
Okay, you got six minutes,
Paris Mike.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.470
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.341
Let's do it
on top of the suitcase.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.821
That'll get that bastard shut.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.519
But, of course, mon cheri.

03:35.606 --> 03:40.872
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

03:40.959 --> 03:44.093
♪ I see love ♪♪

03:53.755 --> 03:55.757
[instrumental music]

03:55.844 --> 03:57.193
Thank you.

04:07.290 --> 04:10.598
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.600
Sorry.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.123
Sorry.

04:14.210 --> 04:15.429
Sorry!

04:18.736 --> 04:21.565
Mike, will you give me
a hand with the bags?

04:21.652 --> 04:22.958
It's first class.

04:23.045 --> 04:24.742
I dropped mine off
with the concierge.

04:24.829 --> 04:27.484
Yeah, and he gave them to me,
so he could fly the plane.

04:27.571 --> 04:31.227
Oh. My bad.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.620
He didn't have his hat on.

04:32.707 --> 04:35.275
- Just help me.
- Absolutely.

04:35.362 --> 04:38.278
You enjoy the complimentary
cham-pan-ya

04:38.365 --> 04:41.281
and I will handle le loo-gaj.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.413
Un.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.416
Deux.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.376
Trois.

04:52.509 --> 04:54.381
Four.

04:54.468 --> 04:56.774
[chuckles]

04:56.861 --> 04:58.298
Voila.

04:58.385 --> 05:01.997
Now we can sit back
and enjoy the luxuries

05:02.084 --> 05:03.433
of traveling first class.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.522
Damn right.
I used up all of my frequent

05:05.609 --> 05:07.002
flyer miles on this upgrade.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.917
I ain't going to miss
a fresh baked cookie

05:09.004 --> 05:13.008
hot towel or warm nut.

05:13.095 --> 05:16.751
Yeah, we'll sleep in shifts,
so nothin' gets past us.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.623
That kind of can-do thinkin'
is why I married you.

05:21.059 --> 05:23.323
- By the way, wife.
- Mmm.

05:23.410 --> 05:26.413
I really want to thank you
for a beautiful honeymoon.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.371
Right back at ya, husband.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.331
But we got to make promise
that once the wheels

05:31.418 --> 05:33.594
touch down in Chicago,
we are back on our diet.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.900
No question. Maybe
in a couple of months

05:35.987 --> 05:39.948
we'll fit in
our wedding rings again.

05:40.035 --> 05:41.558
I can't believe
in eight short hours

05:41.645 --> 05:45.388
we'll be home
and back to our lives.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.956
Oh, crap, that reminds me,
I forgot to buy Carl a gift.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.653
Does he like cheese?

05:52.656 --> 05:55.311
This blanket says "France."
Stuff that in your purse.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.056
Just out of curiosity,
is this the longest you two guys

06:01.143 --> 06:02.449
have ever been apart?

06:02.536 --> 06:04.799
Yeah, he gets a little
lost without me.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.367
It's understandable.
I am kind of his hero.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.544
Sure.

06:11.545 --> 06:13.373
[instrumental music]

06:18.726 --> 06:20.902
Man, that was some impressive
police work back there.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.599
The way you
apprehended that perp

06:22.686 --> 06:24.427
it could've gotten real ugly.

06:24.514 --> 06:27.474
Well, the boy was sorry,
and he did give the Silly Putty

06:27.561 --> 06:29.650
back to the cashier.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.129
You showed a lot of restraint.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.653
11-year-old punk calls
me a butthole

06:32.740 --> 06:35.438
you're gonna see it
on the 6 o'clock news.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.788
- Just doing my job.
- You're too modest.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.182
You are, without a doubt,
thefinest police officer

06:40.269 --> 06:41.618
I've ever had the pleasure
of working with.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.490
Well, I'm sure
your partner's no slouch.

06:43.577 --> 06:46.710
He ain't nothing
buta slouch.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.017
Gone for two weeks,
and not one word.

06:49.104 --> 06:51.280
I even put a prepaid phone card
inside a Hershey bar

06:51.367 --> 06:53.804
so I know he found it.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.720
You got to cut him a little
slack. It is his honeymoon.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.722
Which he wouldn't be on
if it wasn't for me.

06:58.809 --> 07:01.116
I was the Cupid that made
that relationship happen.

07:01.203 --> 07:02.987
And it took
about a dozen arrows.

07:03.074 --> 07:06.600
Like taking down Moby-Dick
with thumbtacks.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.211
The guy in that Saturn's
driving a little erratically.

07:09.298 --> 07:12.519
I'm gonna run his plates.

07:12.606 --> 07:14.825
Listen to you!
You're gonna run his plates.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.349
[laughs]
You are the real deal, officer.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.569
Damn fine cop.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.441
You'd call me from your
honeymoon, wouldn't you?

07:34.062 --> 07:35.977
[whispers]
Excuse me. Excuse me.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.587
Could I have some more
warm nuts?

07:37.674 --> 07:38.806
Absolutely.

07:38.893 --> 07:41.112
And, uh, I-I noticed
that the guy

07:41.199 --> 07:43.027
across the aisle
slept through his cookie.

07:43.114 --> 07:46.204
Is that, is that up for grabs?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.207
I'll see what I can do.

07:49.294 --> 07:51.601
Believe it or not, I've never
flown first class before

07:51.688 --> 07:55.213
but between you and me,
I am hooked.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.476
I'll be back with zee warm nuts.

07:56.563 --> 07:58.042
And-and the cookie.

07:58.129 --> 07:59.783
[whispers]
Don't forget that cookie.

08:09.445 --> 08:11.882
[laughs]

08:13.057 --> 08:14.885
God, I love first class!

08:14.972 --> 08:18.106
It's like a fancy restaurant
where you can sleep.

08:18.193 --> 08:21.675
Well, somebody looks mighty cute
in his complimentary jammies.

08:21.762 --> 08:25.287
Can you believe it?
One size really does fit all.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.204
[groans]
Boy, I hate leaving France.

08:29.291 --> 08:31.293
Oh, me too.

08:31.380 --> 08:34.992
Quaint little shops,
the architecture, the museums..

08:35.079 --> 08:37.908
- And how about the bidet?
- Right?

08:37.995 --> 08:40.868
I mean, the best invention ever.
It's so much more civilized.

08:40.955 --> 08:45.307
I don't know how I'm ever gonna
go back to using toilet paper.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.483
Well, just for the record,
you are.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.180
Oh, yeah, yeah.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.617
I'm just saying,
it's the difference

08:50.704 --> 08:53.794
between a babbling
brook and a pinecone.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.578
True.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.145
I mean, there's a reason
you soak the plates

08:57.232 --> 08:58.189
before you wipe 'em.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.540
Alright.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.976
Good talk.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.325
[sighs]

09:06.850 --> 09:10.941
Wow, the honeymoon is really
over. It was like a dream.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.900
Now it's back to the old grind.

09:12.987 --> 09:15.772
Well, I'm not looking forward
to going back either.

09:15.859 --> 09:20.081
Mom and Victoria without
adult supervision for two weeks?

09:20.168 --> 09:22.518
I'm guessing the whole house
is empty wine bottles

09:22.605 --> 09:26.000
floating in bong water.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.784
And cats.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.612
I don't know why,
but I just keep picturing

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
a ton of stray cats.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.008
[instrumental music]

09:38.839 --> 09:42.190
Victoria, sweetie,
breakfast is ready.

09:42.277 --> 09:43.626
[Victoria]
Coming, mommy!

09:43.713 --> 09:45.454
'Oh! Don't you look pretty!'

09:45.541 --> 09:48.588
Not too slutty for work, is it?

09:48.675 --> 09:51.112
Molly says it makes my breasts
look like two pumpkins

09:51.199 --> 09:53.897
rolling off a porch.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.856
She says the same thing
about my thong underwear

09:55.943 --> 09:59.990
every time I go out
to pick up the newspaper.

10:00.077 --> 10:03.211
- Where are the coffee cups?
- One shelf up.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.083
I moved the wine glasses
down to eye level.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.216
Molly tries to put them
out of my reach.

10:08.303 --> 10:12.307
[scoffs]
She forgot I took
that rock climbing class.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.265
- Morning, ladies.
- Morning!

10:14.352 --> 10:16.006
Boy, I just had the best shower.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.660
Without Mike in the house,
you don't have to worry

10:17.747 --> 10:21.925
about getting scalded
from his 7:00 a.m. double flush.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.840
I just like being able
to walk in the bathroom

10:23.927 --> 10:25.668
without a gas mask
and a canary.

10:28.018 --> 10:30.368
And would you look at this!
Leftover cheesecake.

10:30.455 --> 10:35.069
Has anyone living in this house
ever uttered those words?

10:35.156 --> 10:37.201
God, how many times
have I come down here

10:37.288 --> 10:40.117
to find Mike in the dark
standing at the fridge

10:40.204 --> 10:43.294
like a raccoon
caught digging in the trash can?

10:43.381 --> 10:46.036
Up on his hind legs,
chicken bone in his mouth

10:46.123 --> 10:49.736
with those two little red eyes
glaring at you.

10:49.823 --> 10:52.477
I mean, I love them both,
but it's kind of been

10:52.564 --> 10:54.218
a honeymoon for all of us.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.656
Hey, why don't we celebrate
our last day of freedom

10:56.743 --> 10:59.006
with a nice pitcher of mimosas?

10:59.093 --> 11:01.399
Why not! I'm guessing
it's Sunday somewhere.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.969
- Now, that's convenient.
- Right?

11:06.056 --> 11:08.015
Thank you!

11:08.102 --> 11:10.408
[instrumental music]

11:10.495 --> 11:11.932
Mmm.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.196
Oh.

11:17.677 --> 11:21.071
Sweetie,
are you still awake?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.204
You need to get some sleep.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.380
Look at that map.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.208
That's our plane.

11:27.295 --> 11:31.647
In four inches,
we'll be back in Chicago.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.780
You know, we're gonna
take other trips.

11:33.867 --> 11:37.740
Once, you know, we pay off this
one, and...and buy a house

11:37.827 --> 11:39.699
and pay off my student loans..

11:39.786 --> 11:42.963
- Your what?
- Nothing.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.139
I don't know
why we have to go back.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.315
I mean, what's stopping us
from hopping on another plane

11:47.402 --> 11:48.925
and going anywhere we want.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.666
Well,
I'm out of frequent flyer miles

11:50.753 --> 11:52.494
and you can't buy
plane ticketswith cheese.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.890
We don't need money.
You're a teacher, I'm a cop.

11:56.977 --> 11:58.282
We can do that anywhere.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.502
We can barely do it in Chicago.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.591
Just go to sleep.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.462
I've been sleeping
my whole life.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.769
Paris was like
a splash of cold water.

12:06.856 --> 12:10.033
Oh, God, is this
about that bidet again?

12:10.120 --> 12:11.992
Fine.
We can get one, but good luck

12:12.079 --> 12:14.385
getting my mom off that thing.

12:14.472 --> 12:17.171
This isn't about stuff,
it's about living our lives

12:17.258 --> 12:19.173
for the moment,
and following our hearts.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.522
What has gotten into you?

12:20.609 --> 12:22.176
I had to practically
drag you to Paris

12:22.263 --> 12:25.266
and now you want to roam
the Earth like Kung Fu.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.268
I'm just saying,
there's got to be more to life

12:27.355 --> 12:30.924
than going to work
and coming home and watching TV.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.797
So, it sounds like
you're finally open

12:34.884 --> 12:36.277
for some new experiences.

12:36.364 --> 12:38.540
I am.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.412
You know, we could take
that watercolor class or..

12:41.499 --> 12:43.980
Ooh! Or we could learn
to salsa dance

12:44.067 --> 12:46.026
or we could get season tickets
at the opera.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.642
You really ought
to get some sleep.

12:57.907 --> 13:00.040
Mission accomplished.

13:05.349 --> 13:07.264
[instrumental music]

13:07.351 --> 13:10.050
Well, Mike will be home
tomorrow, so I'm guessing

13:10.137 --> 13:13.270
you'll stop moping around
like Eeyore without his Pooh.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.926
I'm not moping, I'm hurt.

13:17.013 --> 13:20.321
I called him every day
when I was at space camp.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.671
I'm sure there's a very good
reason he hasn't called you.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.542
You know what?
I'm moving on.

13:24.629 --> 13:26.327
At least now I'm riding
with genuine police

13:26.414 --> 13:28.503
and not having to pull over into
a park, so Mike can take a nap

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
on the picnic table.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.290
Let's roll.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.249
See that?
Fly zipped up and not a drop

13:35.336 --> 13:37.381
of mustard on his badge.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.384
And clean hands, and no toilet
paper stuck to his shoe.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.345
I'm telling you,
he's a class act.

13:44.432 --> 13:48.479
Actually waited to get out
of the car before he cut a fart.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.786
Yeah, quite a change from Mike
rolling up all the windows

13:50.873 --> 13:53.441
and shouting, "Live in it, man,
live in it."

13:56.183 --> 13:58.141
[all laughing]

13:58.228 --> 14:02.537
So, so then the guy says,
"Oh, it must be your feet then."

14:02.624 --> 14:05.235
[all laughing]

14:05.322 --> 14:08.978
- Oh, you're terrible.
- I'm filthy, I'm an animal.

14:09.065 --> 14:10.545
[all laughing]

14:11.720 --> 14:13.548
Another round of hooch, ladies?

14:13.635 --> 14:17.508
I don't know. That, that last
mimosa tasted a little weird.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.815
We ran out of OJ and champagne

14:19.902 --> 14:23.297
so I substituted
Tang and tequila.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.299
[laughing]

14:25.386 --> 14:28.084
I call it a Mexican on the moon.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.956
[both laughing]

14:32.001 --> 14:35.309
Hey, we're not out of champagne.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.528
I bought Mike and Molly
a real nice bottle

14:37.615 --> 14:39.095
for a wedding present.

14:39.182 --> 14:42.490
We can't. Molly made us promise
not to unwrap anything

14:42.577 --> 14:44.100
while she was gone.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.190
Well, until she opens that gift,
it still belongs to you.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.888
You sure about this?

14:48.975 --> 14:52.761
As sure as a guy drunk on
Tang and tequila can be.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.764
[laughs]
That's all I need to hear.

14:55.851 --> 14:59.594
Wait, so, so you're saying
the Kama Sutra love kit

14:59.681 --> 15:01.683
is technically still ours?

15:01.770 --> 15:03.380
Can you believe
they left that here?

15:03.467 --> 15:05.861
I told 'em they'd want
that on their honeymoon

15:05.948 --> 15:08.124
but in one ear
and out the other.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.518
I think
that's one of the positions.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.520
[all laughing]

15:16.263 --> 15:17.960
[instrumental music]

15:19.483 --> 15:21.137
"Bucket list number 83."

15:21.224 --> 15:23.618
"Invent ice cream filled M&M's."

15:25.533 --> 15:26.795
Number 84..

15:26.882 --> 15:29.972
Invent pocket refrigerator.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.977
Honey, have you
been awake all night?

15:35.064 --> 15:38.154
Yes, I have.
I'm writing my bucket list.

15:38.241 --> 15:40.461
- May I?
- You may.

15:43.246 --> 15:46.336
"Eat gelato in a Roman piazza.

15:46.423 --> 15:50.558
"Eat Peking duck
near the Great Wall.

15:50.645 --> 15:54.214
Go to Germany
and eat wienerschnitzel."

15:56.694 --> 15:58.435
You know, you can knock
most of these out

15:58.522 --> 16:01.351
at the mall food court.

16:01.438 --> 16:04.050
Oh, hey, hey,
you should climb Mount Everest

16:04.137 --> 16:06.922
because I hear they've
got snow cones up there.

16:16.497 --> 16:21.241
Having someone mock my bucket
list is not on my bucket list.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.634
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've had 11 cups of coffee

16:23.721 --> 16:25.419
and the only thing holding
it in is my seat belt.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.942
[chuckles]

16:30.250 --> 16:33.340
He just came from France and
he can't spell menaga a trois.

16:35.820 --> 16:40.173
Woof. First class or coach,
they all smell like crap.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.179
[rumbling]

16:46.266 --> 16:48.485
Whoa, whoa.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.618
[male announcer]
'Ladies and gentlemen, we seem
to have hit a bit of rough air'

16:50.705 --> 16:54.100
'so please remain seated
with your seat belt fastened.'

16:54.187 --> 16:56.406
I can't die alone in the can.

16:56.493 --> 16:59.670
No belt, there's no belt.
I want to go home.

16:59.757 --> 17:02.195
No more travel,
no more bucket list.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.023
Molly!

17:05.633 --> 17:07.809
'Molly!'

17:14.294 --> 17:15.643
[instrumental music]

17:19.821 --> 17:20.996
You sure you don't
want to go grab a beer

17:21.083 --> 17:21.997
and hang out a little bit?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.999
I'm ready to call it a day.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.435
It's been a real pleasure
riding with you, Carl.

17:25.522 --> 17:27.220
The pleasure was all mine, sir.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.918
You are truly one of the finest
police officers I've ever known.

17:30.005 --> 17:31.615
Appreciate you saying that.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.314
- Your partner's a lucky man.
- Yeah, tell him that.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.272
Oh, by the way,
I got you a little something.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.276
- You bought me a gift?
- Nothing extravagant.

17:40.363 --> 17:41.712
I just noticed,
when we were walking the beat

17:41.799 --> 17:43.366
that you over-pronate
on your right foot.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.457
So you got me an insert?

17:47.544 --> 17:49.416
Yeah, that'll even
out your gait

17:49.503 --> 17:50.808
maybe relieve some of
that lower back pain

17:50.895 --> 17:52.723
that's always troubling you.

17:52.810 --> 17:54.421
Carl, I don't know what to say.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.031
I hope that Mike appreciates
working alongside you

17:56.118 --> 17:57.424
as much as I did.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.208
Nah, he doesn't appreciate me
at all.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.080
Not a word in two weeks,
and tomorrow he's just going

18:01.167 --> 18:03.082
to waltz back into my life
like nothing's wrong.

18:03.169 --> 18:06.215
Well, I'm just glad you and I
had this time together.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.912
Thank you.

18:14.615 --> 18:17.835
Alright.
You be careful out there.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.275
If you'd like to stay in touch,
I'm on Facebook.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.538
My profile pic is Jude Law.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.197
[instrumental music]

18:40.554 --> 18:43.905
Home sweet home, huh?

18:43.992 --> 18:46.603
It's actually not as bad
as I thought it would be.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.779
[mewing]

18:52.522 --> 18:54.481
You called it.

18:54.568 --> 18:56.744
You know, it's funny,
I almost said squirrels.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.532
[instrumental music]

19:06.797 --> 19:09.191
You know, Paris was okay,
but they don't have anything

19:09.278 --> 19:11.889
we can't get right here
in Chicago, Illinois.

19:11.976 --> 19:15.066
- Hmm, I've heard that.
- Except for the cheese.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.287
That's a war
with France we lose.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.377
Thanks for that cool blanket
again, man. Very thoughtful.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.511
I'm gonna keep it in the
plastic, so it stays nice.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.513
Just a little token to show
how much I missed you

19:26.600 --> 19:27.862
and that
I was thinking about you.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.429
Well, it was a lovely surprise

19:29.516 --> 19:32.127
but you know
I did not expect anything.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.651
That's why I did it.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.176
So how were your two weeks
with your temporary partner?

19:37.263 --> 19:40.266
- You guys get along?
- Why? What did you hear?

19:41.876 --> 19:45.009
- Nothing.
- Oh, yeah, he was alright.

19:45.096 --> 19:48.274
Little clingy..

19:48.361 --> 19:50.841
...but I think he benefited
from being around real police.

19:50.928 --> 19:53.714
Ah, lucky for him, he had a guy
like you to show him the ropes.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.759
Well, what good is wisdom unless
you can share it with others?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.457
I'm glad it worked out.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.067
And I'm glad
you had a nice honeymoon.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.636
- Don't you ever leave me again.
- I won't.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.551
I swear to God I won't.

20:10.992 --> 20:12.036
[theme music]
