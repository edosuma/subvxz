[Bubbles] Well, my back's
up against the wall, but...

00:17.058 --> 00:19.102
I'm not giving up
on my beer business.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.855
No fucking way.
I already proved that it can sell,

00:21.938 --> 00:23.398
and that people love it.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.400
I've just gotta figure
out a way to do it

00:25.483 --> 00:26.776
outside of the park.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.487
I mean, I don't understand
everything about...

00:29.738 --> 00:31.573
zoning laws and all the legalities.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.408
So I'm gonna go get some advice
from somebody

00:33.491 --> 00:35.243
that knows what
they're talking about,

00:35.326 --> 00:36.911
so I can do this properly.

00:37.287 --> 00:38.663
I mean, this is about my future

00:38.747 --> 00:41.750
and I've gotta really start
thinking about that now,

00:42.208 --> 00:44.419
especially with Ricky and Julian,
where they're gonna be...

00:44.669 --> 00:46.087
kept men.

00:47.630 --> 00:50.925
[Bubbles softly] Okay, Bubbles,
time to pour on the charm, baby.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.887
Hi there, pretty lady.
How are you doing?

00:53.970 --> 00:56.222
-Good. How are you?
-I'm fantastic.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.390
How can I help you?

00:57.474 --> 00:58.892
Uh, I was wondering

00:58.975 --> 01:00.226
if I could speak to somebody -

01:00.310 --> 01:02.270
I don't even know what
their job title would be -

01:02.353 --> 01:05.315
but somebody that could
explain to me

01:05.397 --> 01:07.692
about zoning laws related to making beer.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.986
-Is there anybody...
-Are you looking to file a complaint...?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.780
No, no. I run a brewery myself

01:11.863 --> 01:14.532
down at the Sunnyvale Trailer Park
with my two best friends.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.701
We make a beer called
Freedom 35.

01:16.785 --> 01:17.952
It's un-fucking-believable.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.163
And we have this drunk
trailer park supervisor,

01:20.246 --> 01:22.082
he called the fucking city
and shut me down,

01:22.165 --> 01:24.751
-'cause he's jealous, and he's a...
-Excuse me.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.795
Did you just say Freedom 35?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.673
-Uh, yeah, Freedom 35.
-So that's your beer?

01:31.049 --> 01:33.176
Yeah, that's the beer I make,
my recipe.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.594
This is amazing.

01:34.677 --> 01:37.096
I had one of my employees
trying to track you down.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.098
Track me down?
What do you mean track me down?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.892
Look, do you have time
for a quick meeting?

01:41.684 --> 01:43.144
-Yeah...
-Kevin Watson.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.146
I'm the President of Halifax Beer.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.774
Hey, Kevin. Bubbles,
Freedom 35 beer.

01:47.857 --> 01:51.486
Uh, I could probably take a meeting.
I've never been in a meeting before.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.779
Please, step into my office.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.155
All right, all right.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.615
Wait, this isn't a trick where

01:55.698 --> 01:58.368
-I go in here and get murdered, is it?
-[laughter]

01:58.618 --> 02:00.245
Pretty lady, I got a meeting!

02:00.328 --> 02:01.538
I'm in a meeting!

02:01.996 --> 02:03.289
[Bubbles on speaker]
Ricky and Julian,

02:03.373 --> 02:04.874
holster your penises!

02:04.958 --> 02:06.876
I repeat, Ricky and Julian,

02:06.960 --> 02:09.920
put your little birds away
and get the fuck to my shed!

02:10.003 --> 02:12.632
We just won the fucking lottery, baby!

02:12.715 --> 02:14.717
[excited grunts, laughs]

02:14.801 --> 02:17.220
[theme music]

02:57.218 --> 03:00.054
[Julian] Bubs, it's way too early for
that fucking loudspeaker, man.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.014
[Bubbles grunting excitedly]

03:01.097 --> 03:03.099
-Hook up for lunch?
-That'd be nice, baby.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.101
She is fucking killing me.

03:05.184 --> 03:06.019
Ricky!

03:06.811 --> 03:08.354
-Julian!
-[Julian] Bubs, calm down.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.773
I just met with the
President of Halifax Beer!

03:10.857 --> 03:13.735
-Oh, my fuck!
-Take a deep breath, man.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.445
-Get your fucking self together!
-He made us an offer...

03:15.528 --> 03:17.947
-Okay, hold up, calm down.
-[exhaling]

03:18.031 --> 03:19.991
He made us an offer, boys.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.785
The President of Halifax Beer...
[exhaling]

03:22.869 --> 03:24.662
he wants to put Freedom 35

03:24.746 --> 03:26.414
right across the fucking country.

03:26.956 --> 03:28.917
What the fuck are you...
Why would he wanna do that?

03:29.000 --> 03:31.502
-It sounds like a fucking scam.
-No Ricky, it's not a scam.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.545
It's the real deal.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.131
He knows about the beer from
his uncle that goes to the Legion

03:35.215 --> 03:37.508
and he thinks this could be huge
'cause we're on the TV.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.010
It's real, Julian.
Check it.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.595
Did you even read
this fucking thing?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.347
-Yes.
-It's a 50/50 deal.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.724
We gotta come up with 50 grand
to make the first batch.

03:44.807 --> 03:48.061
-Have fun with that one, man.
-No Julian, this is a good deal.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.188
This is a good, fair fucking deal.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.149
Look, I don't believe in

03:53.233 --> 03:57.403
cosmic fucking bullshit
or fate or spirituality,

03:57.487 --> 03:58.947
Doug Henning-type stuff.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.032
[panting]
But think about it.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.786
We made a beer called Freedom 35
and now this is happening.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.829
I think something's...

04:07.038 --> 04:08.456
-something's at play here!
-Bubs...

04:08.539 --> 04:10.917
-We did it.
-It's $50,000! How...

04:11.000 --> 04:13.878
How are we just gonna come up
with $50,000, huh?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.339
Well, that's really a technicality

04:16.422 --> 04:18.132
-at this point, isn't it?
-Ha.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.219
Julian, if we work hard and
use our brains, we can do this.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.304
What if we put up one of those
crowdfunding things

04:23.388 --> 04:24.389
you see on the internet?

04:24.472 --> 04:26.975
People make money doing that,
crowdfunding.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.977
The fuck you talking about?
Why would we fund a crowd?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.061
That makes no sense.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.480
No Ricky,
I don't mean that.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.025
Come on, Julian.
Come on, use your brains.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.527
-We can do this.
-Listen to me

04:37.610 --> 04:38.903
and don't fucking freak out.

04:39.487 --> 04:43.366
What if I said there was a way to do this,
very easily, probably today?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.201
[sigh]
Is it illegal?

04:45.285 --> 04:46.869
Very, bud.
Obviously, right?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.788
Yeah, well, obviously

04:48.871 --> 04:50.415
I don't want any part of it.

04:50.623 --> 04:54.043
Ricky, I'm not getting tangled up
in that fucking bullshit

04:54.127 --> 04:56.462
-and ruining our one chance at salvation.
-I hear you.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.215
I got a perfect thing going with Candy.
I'm not ruining that for anything.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.718
All right, fucking relax!
It was just an idea.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.095
Look boys, this might sound fucked,

05:04.595 --> 05:05.888
a little bit fucked,

05:06.180 --> 05:09.100
but maybe the three of us,
we just go down to the bank and say,

05:09.183 --> 05:10.310
"Look, we need a loan."

05:10.393 --> 05:12.020
-[chuckling]
-They might give us a loan.

05:12.103 --> 05:15.440
Bubs, Bubs... We can't even
get a fucking debit card, man.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.066
Jesus.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.111
Well... we're not just gonna give up,
Julian!

05:20.194 --> 05:21.946
This is your fucking field!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.490
You should be able to
come up with this.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.410
Come on, please!
[whimpering]

05:29.203 --> 05:31.080
Okay, I got it.
I got it.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.083
You can do it?

05:34.167 --> 05:37.170
-I might be able to get us some money.
-Okay, but nothing illegal.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.047
No.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.882
Nothing illegal?

05:42.216 --> 05:43.092
No.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.555
[Ricky] Good morning, guys.
Beautiful day out there.

05:47.638 --> 05:48.598
Well, you could fucking knock.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.266
What a nice-looking
breakfast you've got here.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.601
-[clattering]
-Ricky!

05:51.684 --> 05:52.727
-All right, Lahey!
-What?

05:52.810 --> 05:54.896
I need some quick cash,
you owe me a ton of it!

05:54.979 --> 05:57.982
Hand over the fucking papers to that car
and this trailer. I'm selling them!

05:58.066 --> 06:00.109
Julian, I can't give you
the fucking papers!

06:00.193 --> 06:01.152
Wrong answer!

06:01.652 --> 06:03.154
-Julian!
-Hand over the papers!

06:03.237 --> 06:05.239
Julian, I don't have any fucking papers!

06:05.323 --> 06:07.158
[overlapping yelling]

06:07.241 --> 06:08.743
...hand over the fucking papers!

06:08.826 --> 06:10.495
Or else I'm gonna give him my blessing

06:10.578 --> 06:13.081
to come in here every goddamn morning
to ruin your life!

06:13.164 --> 06:14.540
-Yeah!
-J-Julian...

06:14.624 --> 06:17.502
-Julian, we've got no papers!
-Wrong fucking answer!

06:17.585 --> 06:20.797
We don't fucking own the car
or the fucking trailer!

06:20.880 --> 06:22.465
-Wrong answer!
-Ricky!

06:22.548 --> 06:24.884
Ricky! Ricky!
Hang on, hang on!

06:25.176 --> 06:27.303
-What?
-What did you say?

06:27.386 --> 06:31.516
Barb owns the car and the trailer
and every fucking thing that's in it!

06:31.599 --> 06:33.893
-That sounds like another fucking lie!
-Ricky! Ricky! That's enough!

06:33.976 --> 06:35.686
That's eno...
That's enough!

06:36.771 --> 06:37.980
Barb owns everything?

06:38.272 --> 06:40.108
Yeah, that's what I was
trying to tell you.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.192
Oh my fuck.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.194
Right, how much money
do you guys have on you?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.153
I...

06:44.237 --> 06:45.238
Nothing.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.698
Well, I've got $18,

06:47.782 --> 06:49.909
-but that's for pizza night tonight.
-Not anymore.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.370
-Ricky!
-Does Barb own this fucking toaster oven?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.746
[smashing, clattering]

06:54.205 --> 06:55.790
That was my toaster oven!

06:55.873 --> 06:57.041
-[Ricky] Fuck...
-[clattering]

06:57.792 --> 06:59.585
Oh my frig, Mr. Lahey!

07:00.169 --> 07:01.838
Thanks for letting me do that
with you, Julian.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.632
Really means a lot to me.
You're a fucking good friend.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.009
This is so fucked.
We've got this crazy deal on the table,

07:07.093 --> 07:08.845
one that could probably retire us,

07:08.928 --> 07:10.763
and no way of making it fucking happen.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.348
How big do you think it could be?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.975
Could be huge, man.
Are you kidding me?

07:14.058 --> 07:15.309
Right across the country?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.270
Bubbles is on to something here, man.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.063
Well, I told you.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.731
There is a way to make this happen.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.484
Okay, what is it, for fuck's sakes?

07:24.068 --> 07:24.944
[sigh]

07:25.027 --> 07:27.488
-Just hear me out.
-All right.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.907
It took a bit of fucking around...
[engine ignition]

07:29.991 --> 07:33.661
but I just got the Indiegogo campaign
all live and launched,

07:33.870 --> 07:37.415
so now we just let the fucking money
start rolling in on that front.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.126
-[keyboard clicking]
-[cats meowing]

07:40.209 --> 07:41.127
In the meantime,

07:41.669 --> 07:43.504
I'm gonna fucking go deal with
some deadbeats

07:43.588 --> 07:44.964
who have been dodging me.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.260
[on speaker]
Attention, residents of Sunnyvale,

07:49.594 --> 07:52.346
anyone with an outstanding beer tab,

07:52.430 --> 07:54.724
your fucking luck just ran out.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.059
Marguerite, come on down!

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
You're the first contestant on
You Owe Me Fucking Money.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.856
$118.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.901
Cecil Cameron, $148.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.862
[Donnie] Fuck off with
the fucking announcements!

08:07.945 --> 08:11.115
[Bubbles] Oh Donnie, okay,
I'm coming after you too, bud.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.576
$267.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.038
[Donnie] I hope you're willing to suck it
out of the eye of my cock,

08:17.121 --> 08:18.664
'cause I don't fucking have it!

08:18.748 --> 08:22.001
[Bubbles] Jesus Murphy, Donnie,
the fucking language!

08:25.505 --> 08:26.964
[clattering]

08:27.048 --> 08:28.508
Easy on the fucking deck, man.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.301
It just slipped right
out of my fucking hand.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.761
How you making out, Bubs?

08:31.844 --> 08:34.679
Hey, I'm making out
great actually, Julian.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.142
I've got $416 collected
from customers.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.019
I've got the internet
campaign up and running.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.395
-It's doing great.
-Right on. How much you pulling in?

08:42.855 --> 08:46.651
Well, I didn't pull in anything
but I got 26 views, boys.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.778
No offence, Bubs,
but that's fucking detarded.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.531
Ricky, first of all, that word's never
gonna catch on

08:51.781 --> 08:53.741
and second of all, it's not detarded.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.160
I mean, once word of mouth starts flying,
it can snowball.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.454
People make a hundred grand
a day sometimes on this.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.456
Who? Who the fuck makes
a hundred grand a day?

09:00.748 --> 09:03.167
Well... geniuses who invent things

09:03.251 --> 09:05.127
that are gonna change
humanity, but still...

09:05.211 --> 09:07.213
Well, we've got a
better id... Well...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.549
-Talk to Julian about it.
-Ricky!

09:09.632 --> 09:11.050
This thing we were thinking.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.176
Look at me.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.513
You guys are talking
about doing illegal stuff.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.722
Bubs, just hear us out, man.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.558
No, I'm not fucking
hearing you out

09:18.808 --> 09:20.268
because I'm not interested.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.687
-That's the thing.
-Bubs, look.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.731
You said this is the big one,
and I agree, okay?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.525
We'll just do it one
last time, okay?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.026
Then we retire.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.280
I feel it in my gut.
This plan's perfect, flawless.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.865
How many times have
I heard you say

09:34.949 --> 09:36.909
those exact fucking words, Julian?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.119
How many times?

09:38.369 --> 09:40.454
Do you guys know
what the definition of insanity is?

09:40.538 --> 09:41.622
Do you know what it is?

09:41.872 --> 09:44.834
It's doing the same thing
over and over again,

09:44.917 --> 09:46.252
expecting a different result.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.045
I know, but it's gonna be different
this time.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.255
-It could be anyway.
-This time,

09:49.338 --> 09:51.132
-we're gonna get results, man.
-That's right.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.717
Listen to yourselves.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.261
Lis... Okay, how is it fucking different
this time?

09:55.344 --> 09:58.514
Because we've never had
the fucking big guy on our side before.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.474
The big g... ? Ricky,

10:00.558 --> 10:02.643
tell me you're not talking about
fucking God right now.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.353
I'm not talking about
fucking him or her.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.230
Remember the cow shit I shoved
under the trailers

10:06.314 --> 10:09.108
-to fucking get rid of the rats?
-Yeah, I remember very vividly

10:09.191 --> 10:11.360
you filling my truck with shit
and destroying it.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.279
Well, guess what?
That wasn't normal cow shit.

10:13.362 --> 10:16.282
That was fucking angel shit
sent down from Jesus God.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.242
-Ugh...
-Angel...?

10:19.118 --> 10:22.455
What in a flying fiddler's fuckstrap
are you talking about?

10:22.538 --> 10:25.541
Jesus God growed mushrooms under
all the fucking trailers in the park.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
Fucking beautiful little
perfect magic mushrooms,

10:27.710 --> 10:29.128
thousands of the fucking things!

10:29.211 --> 10:31.047
Thousands of the fucking things...

10:31.130 --> 10:33.090
So, you have a shit ton
of mushrooms.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.218
You said you had a fucking few, Ricky!
You fucking lied again!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.638
Well, technically I didn't lie to you.
When I said a few,

10:38.721 --> 10:41.307
I may have forgot to add
the word "garbage bags" to that.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.684
And sometimes a few means
four or five, right?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.895
-I've used it to say four or five before.
-Oh, yeah...

10:45.978 --> 10:47.772
Look, Bubs, Bubs.
Whyever it's fucking happened,

10:47.855 --> 10:48.981
there's thousands of the fucking things,

10:49.065 --> 10:51.359
enough to get this beer launched, man.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.111
One-shot deal.
We do this, we retire, man.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.197
Like... no more
breaking the fucking law,

10:56.280 --> 10:57.448
no more bullshit.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.700
We're retired. For sure.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.120
-A one-shot deal?
-A one-shot deal, man.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.456
Ah, come on, buddy.
Just like the fucking Blue Man brothers.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.084
[whispering] Oh, my God.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.836
I'm insane!
I'm insane, everybody!

11:11.462 --> 11:12.755
Oh, my fuck!

11:12.838 --> 11:14.673
Okay, listen, if I agree to this,

11:15.216 --> 11:17.134
just so we're clear,
this has nothing to do

11:17.385 --> 11:20.179
with magic angel shit
being sent down from God

11:20.429 --> 11:24.683
to send us on an everlasting quest
for fucking divine fucking peace.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.853
All right, so are we gonna do it?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.774
God fucking damn it!

11:32.358 --> 11:33.401
Yes!

11:34.693 --> 11:36.153
Yeah-h-h!

11:36.237 --> 11:38.030
-Don't be jerking me off.
-Yes!

11:39.031 --> 11:40.491
You won't regret this, buddy.

11:42.660 --> 11:43.536
[meowing]

11:44.870 --> 11:45.913
[Julian] Boop!

11:51.460 --> 11:53.671
[clicking, clattering]

11:56.257 --> 11:58.551
[George] Christ, were you two fighting?
What the hell happened in here?

11:58.634 --> 12:01.345
[Lahey] Hello, George.
Two of our best friends dropped over,

12:01.429 --> 12:02.721
Ricky and Julian.

12:03.055 --> 12:07.017
They asked if they could have the papers
for the fucking trailer and for the car.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.436
It seems that Julian

12:08.519 --> 12:11.188
is in fucking need of some quick cash

12:11.272 --> 12:13.482
and, uh, he told me
he's gonna send Ricky over

12:13.566 --> 12:16.902
every fucking morning
and destroy our fucking place!

12:17.528 --> 12:20.030
Those guys had better
back the fuck off.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.283
You're not coming up with
or giving them anything.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.326
What? We're supposed
to just let them come in here

12:24.410 --> 12:27.788
-and smash our shit up every day?
-Jesus, you're stupid, Randy!

12:27.872 --> 12:30.207
Why don't you fuck off,
go eat yourself to death?

12:30.499 --> 12:31.917
Jim and I will handle this.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.420
Go on!

12:35.337 --> 12:37.548
-[Randy] Frig's sakes...
-Listen, Jim.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.467
If they're that desperate for money,

12:39.800 --> 12:41.969
they're either in a really bad situation

12:42.178 --> 12:44.305
or they're up to something really big.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.098
We're gonna take 'em down,

12:46.849 --> 12:47.850
you and me.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.686
[thud, clinking]

12:51.353 --> 12:53.898
Ow! For fuck's sakes!
Piece of shit!

12:53.981 --> 12:55.816
Fuck. Jesus, Jim.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.443
Oh, that carrot-eating
slut-cumber!

12:57.526 --> 12:59.904
Three bucks a fucking gram?
Reggie, come on!

12:59.987 --> 13:02.281
You can tell him to take
his chocolate-covered ostrich balls

13:02.364 --> 13:04.825
and ram them right up
a moose's fucking ass!

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
There has to be another
option here, Reg.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.455
No, I'm not fronting the fucking things!
Fuck that!

13:09.538 --> 13:10.915
It's cash, up front.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.375
Oh, for fuck's sakes...

13:13.959 --> 13:15.211
Yeah, I know it's a lot,

13:15.294 --> 13:18.130
but it's a serious fucking opportunity
for the right fucking person here.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.800
It's three bucks a gram, Reggie!
That is fucked!

13:23.802 --> 13:26.180
Jesus fucking Christ, all right,
set it up: 50 Gs.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.849
But I'm going to need another
couple of hours now at least. Fuck!

13:28.933 --> 13:29.767
[clattering]

13:32.478 --> 13:34.605
[Bubbles] Ricky, come on,
for fuck's sakes, would you?

13:34.688 --> 13:37.233
Let's get this show on the road,
I wanna get it over with.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.859
-We got a serious fucking problem.
-What?

13:38.943 --> 13:41.570
-Oh, yeah...
-I can only get three bucks a gram now.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.906
We're gonna need 37 pounds,
gonna have to pick another garbage bag,

13:43.989 --> 13:47.368
-that's only 29 or 30 fucking pounds.
-Here we fucking go!

13:47.451 --> 13:50.079
Here we go! "Oh, this is gonna be easy,"
you guys said.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.372
One fucking sale!

13:51.455 --> 13:53.749
Now we're right back into
the fucking bullshit

13:53.832 --> 13:55.459
-and we're gonna get fucked!
-[car squeaking]

13:55.543 --> 13:58.212
-Bubs, calm down. Calm down!
-Don't fuck my car.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.839
Cory, Jacob, round up the Roc-Pile,
see if they'll help us out.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.050
Offer 'em a quarter pound of these
fucking things, okay?

14:03.133 --> 14:04.760
-Okay.
-Okay. Go!

14:05.844 --> 14:07.346
It's all right.
A little bump here, boys.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.389
We've got this though.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.975
-I mashed my ball.
-Good.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.269
No, like I mashed it good.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.813
Pretty much picked all of 'em,
we're gonna have to look for stragglers.

14:15.896 --> 14:16.772
So spread out, boys.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.066
I can't believe there were mushrooms under
all these trailers

14:19.149 --> 14:20.067
and we didn't even know.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.902
You one sly-ass motherfucker.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.654
It wasn't me, it was fucking Jesus God.

14:23.737 --> 14:25.030
Yo, stop, everybody.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.324
Yo, I got a hole in my bag.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.909
You got a hole in your fucking head.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.995
See if you can figure it out.
Solve it, Cory.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.583
[humming Final Jeopardy music]

14:35.666 --> 14:37.334
-Jacob?
-Yo.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.296
-Can I put my bag in your bag?
-Sure, man.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.380
Yeah, man.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.049
Double bag,
double mushrooms.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.301
Double fucked!

14:46.135 --> 14:47.136
[imitating explosion]

14:49.263 --> 14:50.681
[George]
They're going under the trailers

14:51.015 --> 14:52.516
and they have bags.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.435
Those sneaky fuckers.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.270
They're growing weed
under there, guaranteed.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.938
[Lahey]
Move in a little closer, Georgio.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.940
Yeah, that's what they're doing,

15:00.024 --> 15:02.151
growing weed under the trailers.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.652
You moron!

15:04.069 --> 15:06.071
Maybe they're not
doing anything illegal.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.158
I think we should do nothing,
and just leave them alone.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.911
-You paranoid, psychotic lunatic!
-That's enough!

15:11.994 --> 15:12.953
[loud slap, Randy grunting]

15:13.287 --> 15:15.831
Go make yourself useful!
Go make some popcorn!

15:20.628 --> 15:21.921
They're all there.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.881
There's Cory,
there's Jacob.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.634
[chuckle] The Roc-Pile's there.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.052
Look at this, Jim.
This is great.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.346
[laughing]
All the boys.

15:30.554 --> 15:34.516
Julian, Ricky, Bubbles.
We've got these bastards. Ha! Ha!

15:34.767 --> 15:37.353
Hey, we found a whole batch
over here, dude!

15:37.436 --> 15:39.229
Yeah, there's a few
under here, too, Cory.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.065
Make sure you get those.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.400
-Ricky, how are you doing?
-We must be getting close, boys.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.486
Let's pick these and take
'em back and weigh them.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.363
-[cell phone ringing]
-[Julian] Hey, baby. Yep.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.906
No, I can't make it today.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.992
-Yeah, beer meetings all afternoon.
-[high-pitched droning]

15:52.076 --> 15:54.912
-I know. I miss you, too.
-[Ricky] What the fuck is that thing?

15:55.245 --> 15:57.498
Ah, decent! It's a drone!

15:58.374 --> 16:00.793
Who the fuck's flying it?
Is there somebody inside that thing?

16:00.876 --> 16:02.711
No, Ricky.
Somebody around here...

16:02.795 --> 16:04.546
Oh, just wait! Just wait!

16:05.089 --> 16:06.966
Oh my fuck! That could be
a police drone.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.343
-There's a camera on that thing, Ricky.
-What are you talking about?

16:09.426 --> 16:11.011
-Okay, just act natural, everybody.
-[gun clicking]

16:11.095 --> 16:12.304
-Fuck you!
-[gunshots]

16:13.597 --> 16:15.391
-[Bubbles] Jesus Murphy!
-...Ricky lighting off fireworks.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.476
You sure no one's in there, Bubs,
like Gazoo or something?

16:17.559 --> 16:18.519
Ricky!

16:18.602 --> 16:21.188
-Fuck you, Gazoo!
-[gunshots]

16:21.271 --> 16:24.191
[Bubbles] Ricky, Gazoo was
a fictional character on The Flintstones.

16:24.274 --> 16:27.361
-Holy fuck, boys.
-[Ricky] That shit was real.

16:27.444 --> 16:29.697
Put that fucking gun away!
You use your head.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.990
Put it away!

16:31.073 --> 16:34.368
-What if that was a police drone?
-Well, it's fucking dead now, isn't it?

16:34.660 --> 16:36.495
-Oh, for fuck's sakes!
-[Bubbles] Fuck!

16:38.539 --> 16:39.415
Holy fuck!

16:39.498 --> 16:41.709
-That son of a fucking bitch!
-Holy Jesus, Randy!

16:41.792 --> 16:42.751
Now he's done it.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
-Ricky shot the drone down!
-I'll get the bastards charged

16:44.670 --> 16:46.422
with destruction of property,
if nothing else.

16:46.505 --> 16:48.048
Let's go, Jim.
Let's take them down.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.384
[Randy] Don't go down there, Mr. Lahey.
George is crazy.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.885
Please don't go down that path.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.638
You shut your fucking mouth.
You're nothing here but a waste of food.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.223
You wanna get slapped
across the face again,

16:56.306 --> 16:58.934
you grease-covered minion?
Huh? Do you? Keep talking!

16:59.018 --> 17:01.562
Mr. Lahey, you've got to choose right now
between George or me.

17:01.645 --> 17:04.231
Oh, go cry in
the fucking bedroom, Randy,

17:04.314 --> 17:05.566
-you fat fucking cow!
-Ooh!

17:06.483 --> 17:07.483
Come on, Jim.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.278
Let's go show them who's boss.

17:09.528 --> 17:11.446
-George.
-What?

17:13.615 --> 17:14.532
You're fired.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.492
Fuck...

17:16.577 --> 17:18.746
-Un-fucking-believable!
-You heard me, George.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.122
You're fucking fired!

17:20.204 --> 17:22.165
Unbelievable, you fucking pussies!

17:22.249 --> 17:24.084
We were that close to winning
this whole thing.

17:24.167 --> 17:26.170
You really want to
think this through, Jim.

17:26.252 --> 17:27.253
You can't fire me.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.089
You need me!
I'm your muscle!

17:29.173 --> 17:30.549
-Is that right, George?
-Yes!

17:30.632 --> 17:31.550
Well, guess what?

17:31.633 --> 17:34.344
I'm the fucking supervisor
and you are the fucking fired.

17:34.428 --> 17:35.804
Now, get the fuck out of here.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.139
Now!

17:37.222 --> 17:38.515
-Okay, fine.
-Yeah.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.685
I'll send them to jail myself.
Have a nice life, fuckheads!

17:41.769 --> 17:43.520
-Yeah.
-[Randy] Frig off, George!

17:46.482 --> 17:47.357
[chuckling]

17:47.441 --> 17:50.277
-Never cry shit wolf, George!
-Good one, Mr. Lahey.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.403
Thanks, Randy.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.032
I love you, bud.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.784
I'm sorry I didn't s...

17:57.326 --> 17:59.203
stick up for you
a little bit sooner.

17:59.870 --> 18:02.581
Well, you did, Mr. Lahey,
and that's what matters.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.333
-I love you too, buddy.
-Thanks.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.420
Let's make Sunnyvale
great again, Randy.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.047
-Okay, Mr. Lahey.
-All right.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.299
It's so cool these
things came out of cows.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.676
[Cory] And they look like skinny
dudes with big hats on 'em.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.138
Cory, can I get your fucking brain
analyzed by a profession...

18:18.472 --> 18:20.766
Boys... Ricky,
George Green's right behind us!

18:20.849 --> 18:23.185
-Hide the mushrooms.
-Fuck's sakes, meet back at the shed,

18:23.268 --> 18:25.020
I'll deal with this.
Get those fucking things weighed.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.021
All right, let's go.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.231
Can I fucking help you?

18:27.314 --> 18:28.357
-Hope so.
-Oh, yeah?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.067
-Question for you, just curious.
-Yeah?

18:30.150 --> 18:31.902
What exactly are you doing
under all the trailers?

18:31.985 --> 18:34.154
None of your fucking business.
I've got a contract with Barb.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.406
I'm allowed to be under
any one of these fucking trailers.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.616
-I know what you're doing.
-Yeah?

18:37.699 --> 18:39.535
It took me about 10 seconds.
Growing weed.

18:39.618 --> 18:40.452
[laughing]

18:40.536 --> 18:43.122
Guess you should've thought of it
a little longer than 10 seconds, George.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.957
How the fuck would you grow weed
under trailers?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.333
It's dark and they're not high enough.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.461
That is hands down the dumbest thing
I have ever been accused of!

18:49.545 --> 18:52.339
-Then you don't mind if I take a look.
-Knock yourself out.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.134
I'm dealing with the fucking cow shit
to get rid of the rodents, dummy!

18:56.385 --> 18:58.679
Go ahead, get right under there,
take a good fucking look, George.

18:58.762 --> 18:59.930
Back off, Rick!

19:00.013 --> 19:02.015
You're being detained
anyway for destruction of property.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.103
That drone you shot down,
that was worth over $5,000.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.105
No idea what you're talking about.
I fired one shot

19:08.188 --> 19:10.357
at this weird-looking birdy thing,
I don't think I hit it.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.275
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:11.358 --> 19:14.194
Better get the police down here to get
this sorted out. What do you think?

19:14.278 --> 19:15.821
-[phone ringing]
-Or we could do this.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.074
-[glass shattering]
-[Donnie] Jesus Christ!

19:19.158 --> 19:21.618
I just replaced that fucking thing!

19:21.702 --> 19:24.538
You can't smash every phone
in this park, Rick.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.874
-Is that right?
-Don't stray too far.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.376
Lick my tan balls,
how about that, George?

19:32.421 --> 19:33.797
How we making out, boys?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.424
[Bubbles] Just getting the last ones
on here.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.592
-Nice.
-Holy fuck,

19:36.675 --> 19:38.677
-there's more than I thought though.
-Right on.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.262
I think we should be all right.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.890
-Okay, just wait.
-What's it saying?

19:42.973 --> 19:45.601
It's looking like... uh, 96, but...

19:45.684 --> 19:47.978
Cory, stop leaning
on the fucking thing!

19:49.897 --> 19:51.607
Okay boys, with these,

19:51.690 --> 19:54.276
the grand total with the other ones,
37.5 pounds.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.694
-Yes!
-Yes!

19:55.777 --> 19:56.737
Make it an even 37,

19:56.820 --> 19:59.364
I'm not giving that piss goblet any extra,
not for that fucking price.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.908
Gotta move it out.
Cops are on the way.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.367
Fucking George Green.
"Ooh, I shot down...

20:02.451 --> 20:04.369
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...
-Fucking asshole!

20:04.453 --> 20:05.829
I can't go if there's cops involved.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.122
What are you talking about?

20:07.456 --> 20:09.750
It was fucking dumb shooting that
goddamned thing down.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.501
No way I'm putting
my relationship on the line

20:11.585 --> 20:13.712
-over your fucking stupidity.
-Just wait now.

20:13.795 --> 20:14.671
If you're not going,

20:14.755 --> 20:16.256
-I'm not fucking going.
-I'm not going, man.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.050
I wasn't even supposed
to be involved.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.635
Okay, boys. What the fuck
is happening here?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.428
'Cause I'm not doing this by myself.
Fuck that!

20:21.511 --> 20:22.429
So are we doing this,

20:22.512 --> 20:24.598
or am I flushing these
down the fucking toilet?

20:25.849 --> 20:27.309
Ah, for fuck's sakes.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.102
As soon as we do this
fucking deal, boys,

20:29.186 --> 20:31.480
we need to get some fucking food.
I'm dying here.

20:32.022 --> 20:34.149
[Bubbles] How about we just stay focused
on the fucking job

20:34.233 --> 20:35.817
and worry about food later?

20:35.901 --> 20:38.445
I'd like a big hot dog,
a jumbo dog or something maybe.

20:38.528 --> 20:39.696
-[police siren wailing]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa...

20:39.780 --> 20:40.822
Okay, boys, boys, boys...

20:40.906 --> 20:42.616
[Bubbles] Oh, for fuck's sakes!
Are you kidding me?

20:42.699 --> 20:44.743
It's okay. The fuck is he doing
putting his lights on?

20:44.826 --> 20:46.328
-I'm not even speeding.
-[Julian] You kidding me?

20:46.411 --> 20:48.872
What is he--
Oh, my fuck, he's wheeling around.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.749
You know what? It must
have been fucking George.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.043
What an idiot!
He probably called the fucking cops.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.045
-But it's all right.
-[Bubbles] What are we gonna do?

20:55.128 --> 20:57.798
Boys, everybody calm the fuck down.
We're good here, all right?

20:57.881 --> 20:59.424
George didn't know
about the mushrooms.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.219
Just let Ricky do
what Ricky does best.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.595
-[siren approaching]
-[engine shutting off]

21:03.679 --> 21:05.806
-We're fine.
-[whispering] Boys, I'm freaking out!

21:05.889 --> 21:06.848
I'm freaking out!

21:06.932 --> 21:09.434
[Ricky] Stay calm. We're good.
We're okay here.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.479
I wish I was fucking high, though,
I know that.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.649
-Ricky, be quiet, be quiet.
-[Ricky] ...fucking idiot.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.198
-How are you doing today, sir?
-I am doing fucking awesome.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.116
How you doing?

21:24.199 --> 21:26.326
J.P. Cormier,
just coming from the studio.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.286
-What... the singer?
-Yeah.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.288
Oh, I got all your albums.
I love your music.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.706
Oh, right on.
That's great.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.165
Mr. Cormier, can you tell me why

21:32.249 --> 21:33.875
you don't have a licence plate
on your vehicle?

21:33.959 --> 21:36.128
Yes, I can.
Good reason for that actually.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.171
I just bought the car
to put in a music video.

21:38.255 --> 21:40.048
That's why it's missing
the door and, uh,

21:40.132 --> 21:41.216
we're gonna register it right now.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.592
-Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.178
Hey, can you tell me
which one of these two is Ricky?

21:45.929 --> 21:47.931
We just dropped Ricky
down at the mall.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.058
He said he needed to buy some
underpants or something

21:50.142 --> 21:52.853
-and was gonna get a hold of us later.
-Ah, shit, that's too bad.

21:52.936 --> 21:53.979
I pulled you guys over

21:54.062 --> 21:55.939
because of the incident
at Sunnyvale Trailer Park.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.441
Okay. What incident was that?

21:57.524 --> 21:59.484
I wanted to shake Ricky's hand.
I heard what he did

21:59.568 --> 22:01.028
to our ex-Chief of Police.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.571
[chuckling] Shot down his drone!

22:02.654 --> 22:03.905
-Fucking hilarious.
-I was there for that.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.116
That was fucking funny.
He fucked him over good.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.160
Fucking George.
George is so fucked!

22:08.243 --> 22:10.829
Anyhow, George called it in,
so we have to talk to Ricky.

22:10.912 --> 22:12.039
-Just doing our job.
-Yeah, yeah...

22:12.122 --> 22:13.332
Can you do me a favour?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.417
Can you tell Ricky
to just chill out for a bit,

22:15.500 --> 22:18.462
so we don't have to drain any more of
the Department's time and resources?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.629
-Yes.
-We can do that.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.214
Don't know him that well,
I got his number.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.425
I'll give him a call and say,
"Bud, fucking chill out.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.719
You're wasting police money here.
It's not a cool thing, right?"

22:25.802 --> 22:27.971
Great, thanks. Well, listen,
enjoy the rest of your day, guys.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.931
-Have a good one.
-You, too, sir, thank you very much!

22:30.015 --> 22:31.808
-Oh, my fuck.
-[Ricky] See, we're good.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.602
-Oh, oh! Uh, I almost forgot.
-Yeah?

22:33.685 --> 22:35.312
-Your brake light's flickering.
-Okay, thank you.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.065
Probably a loose bulb. Why don't you
pop the trunk? I'll take a look for you.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.649
Ah, you know what?
I really appreciate that

22:39.733 --> 22:41.610
but we're kind of in a rush,
and I couldn't anyway.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.403
The guy that fucking owned
the car before me

22:43.487 --> 22:45.697
welded the fucking trunk shut.
It doesn't open.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.784
Are you sure? I don't see any of the...
any welds on the seams.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.369
Well, he... he said he went in
through the back seat.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.913
Something about it made
the weld stronger...

22:52.996 --> 22:53.872
-He did.
-...from underneath...

22:53.955 --> 22:56.416
[laughing] Hand me the keys.
I think he was just fucking with you.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.251
-I'll pop it open for you.
-Know what? That'd be great.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.962
Anything you can do to help out, officer,
I would really appreciate it.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.381
-Thank you.
-Sir, is there another reason

23:03.465 --> 23:05.133
why you don't want me
to see inside your trunk?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.760
God, no.
You can go in the trunk.

23:06.843 --> 23:10.013
Have a little nap there if you want.
My trunk is fair game to everybody.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.014
-[whimpering]
-Mr. Cormier,

23:11.098 --> 23:12.808
can you step out of
the vehicle for me?

23:12.891 --> 23:15.435
Sure, yeah. I can do that. Just...
right in this area here or...

23:15.519 --> 23:17.437
-[engine revving]
-Okay, everybody out of the vehicle now!

23:17.521 --> 23:19.815
-Jesus, Ricky! What are you doing?
-[Ricky] We got no fucking choice!

23:19.898 --> 23:21.942
There's four bags of fucking
mushrooms in the trunk!

23:22.025 --> 23:22.943
[Bubbles] Oh, my fuck!

23:23.026 --> 23:24.820
-[Julian] Go! Go! Go! Go!
-[Bubbles] He's coming, boys!

23:24.903 --> 23:27.614
He's coming after us,
and he's coming hot!

23:29.157 --> 23:31.243
[Ricky] We're okay, Bubs.
Look at the fucking lead I'm opening.

23:31.326 --> 23:33.120
-We're losing him!
-[Julian] Right turn here! Right turn!

23:33.453 --> 23:34.871
[Bubbles] Oh! Ricky!

23:35.747 --> 23:37.374
Oh, my Jesus Christ!

23:37.666 --> 23:39.334
[Julian] You're doing good, man!
You're doing good!

23:40.377 --> 23:42.671
-[Bubbles whimpering]
-[Julian] Right turn into the junkyard.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.131
-[loud pop]
-[Ricky] My God! What the fuck?

23:44.214 --> 23:45.173
-Oh my fuck...
-Take a right.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.217
-[Ricky] ...we just blew the radiator.
-[Bubbles] What?!

23:47.551 --> 23:49.427
Why are we turning
into a fucking junkyard?

23:49.511 --> 23:51.638
We're gonna have to bail!
We're gonna blow the fucking engine!

23:51.721 --> 23:52.639
[Julian] Stay to the right!

23:53.265 --> 23:55.433
Oh, yeah, let's go into
a junkyard, Julian,

23:55.517 --> 23:57.269
where we have
no fucking escape route!

23:57.352 --> 23:59.146
Just shut the fuck up!
We're gonna bail!

23:59.229 --> 24:00.522
The temperature's going
right up here, okay?

24:00.605 --> 24:02.607
We're gonna have to
fucking go into the woods...

24:02.691 --> 24:05.360
[Bubbles] Oh, yeah, let's have
a fucking foot pursuit!

24:05.443 --> 24:06.444
That's even better!

24:06.528 --> 24:09.239
When I stop, grab a bag of mushrooms,
get the fuck into the woods, Bubs!

24:09.322 --> 24:10.949
We're fine here!
We're okay.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.033
Let's go!
Everybody out!

24:14.619 --> 24:16.496
[Bubbles] "Yeah,
this will be easy," you said.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.456
Now we're in a fucking foot pursuit!

24:18.540 --> 24:20.542
Grab a fucking bag of mushrooms!
Go! Go! Go!

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
[Bubbles whimpering]

24:24.921 --> 24:27.007
[Bubbles] Fuck, I think
we lost them, boys.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.259
Fucking sucks about my car
but I guess I'll get another one.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.552
How the fuck do you expect

24:30.635 --> 24:32.929
they're not gonna just trace that one
back to us anyway?

24:33.013 --> 24:34.764
Because when I bought it,
I signed Randy Lahey.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.932
-[chuckle]
-Nice.

24:36.183 --> 24:38.602
I think we did it, boys.
We're in the fucking clear.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.145
I fucking hope so...

24:40.228 --> 24:42.189
-Just wait! Listen!
-[dog barking]

24:42.272 --> 24:44.024
Oh, the fucking K9 unit!

24:44.107 --> 24:46.026
-All right, let's run!
-K9 unit!

24:46.109 --> 24:47.068
God damn it!

24:47.444 --> 24:48.612
[Bubbles whimpering]

24:48.904 --> 24:51.072
[Ricky] I forgot how fun it is
running from the cops!

24:51.156 --> 24:54.367
[Bubbles] Oh yeah,
this is a fucking treat, Ricky!

24:54.451 --> 24:56.161
Just a fucking treat!

24:59.456 --> 25:00.790
I fucking love you guys.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.250
Get the fuck in the truck!

25:02.334 --> 25:03.919
-Thank God for country people...
-[Julian] Get in!

25:04.002 --> 25:05.503
...leaving their fucking keys
in their vehicles.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.880
[Bubbles] Are we just taking a truck?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.632
-[Ricky] We're just fucking taking it.
-[dogs barking]

25:08.715 --> 25:10.717
-[engine ignition]
-[Bubbles] Let's just go, Ricky.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.095
-Hey, fuckers!
-[overlapping yelling, gunshot]

25:14.346 --> 25:16.014
[Bubbles] Jesus Christ, fuck!

25:16.598 --> 25:17.807
[Julian] Everybody okay?

25:18.225 --> 25:19.976
I hope to fuck they're still here.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.479
There he is.
Fuck.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.273
[Bubbles] Let's just get this
fucking over with, boys.

25:25.857 --> 25:27.317
Oh, my God.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.903
[Ricky] It's almost done, Bubs.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.490
[Tommy] Oh, look who decides
to show up.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.660
Who the fuck do you guys think you are,
making us wait out here

25:36.743 --> 25:39.412
for over a goddamn hour?
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!

25:39.496 --> 25:42.499
-That's it, the deal is off!
-[mixed yelling, guns clicking]

25:42.874 --> 25:45.835
You can't even imagine what the fuck
we just went through to get here!

25:45.919 --> 25:48.505
We've got the 'shrooms.
Give us our fucking cash!

25:49.089 --> 25:52.008
Guys, guys... relax.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.512
-I'm just fucking around with you.
-[Bubbles] Jesus Christ, cold play!

25:55.595 --> 25:58.848
-Yeah, you almost got fucking shot.
-All right, come on, guys.

25:58.932 --> 26:01.601
Let's do this motherfucking deal, huh?

26:01.685 --> 26:03.812
I'm gonna need you to
shut that fucking shit down

26:03.895 --> 26:05.397
right the fuck now.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.608
You heard him, snail muff.
Shut the fucking cameras down!

26:09.609 --> 26:10.986
[meowing]

26:11.069 --> 26:12.779
[Ricky] Holy fuck I was hungry.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.198
Here, boys. These are
as cold as a whore's heart.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.324
-Yeah!
-Thanks, buddy.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.534
This had to be

26:17.617 --> 26:20.036
the most fucked up,
scariest day of my life.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.289
I hear you.
But was it fucking worth it, though?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.750
-Yes.
-[laughter]

26:25.834 --> 26:27.210
-There you go!
-Boys, you realize

26:27.294 --> 26:29.004
this is the first time in history

26:29.087 --> 26:31.047
that we've pulled off
a job this successfully?

26:31.131 --> 26:32.674
-No, it's not.
-Ever. It is, Ricky.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.301
Now, knock on wood, everybody.

26:34.384 --> 26:36.094
[Julian] Finally.
I mean, it was a bit risky.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.721
It was pretty dumb but, boys,

26:37.804 --> 26:39.931
our future's looking
pretty fucking bright right now.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.016
Really fucking bright.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.143
Corey Hart couldn't look
at our future, baby.

26:43.226 --> 26:44.060
Here we fucking go!

26:44.144 --> 26:46.771
I don't think so! What do you
want? Get the fuck out of here!

26:46.855 --> 26:49.149
Tell that dick-twisted George Green
to leave me the fuck alone.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.859
He called the cops on me
for nothing!

26:50.942 --> 26:53.236
-Calm the frig down, Ricky.
-No! I'm not calming the frig down.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.905
-Fuck you!
-Mr. Lahey fired George.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.490
-What?
-We come in peace.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.617
Julian...

27:01.328 --> 27:03.038
I'd like to take this opportunity

27:03.121 --> 27:04.622
to wipe the slate clean, Julian.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.499
Oh, yeah?
How you gonna do that now?

27:06.583 --> 27:07.542
Julian,

27:08.293 --> 27:09.544
I'm gonna tell you something.

27:09.627 --> 27:11.046
And after I finish telling you,

27:11.129 --> 27:13.131
you're probably gonna wanna
beat the shit out of me.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.051
But it's a shit weight
I need to have lifted off my shoulders.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.011
-Mr. Lahey, are you sure...
-Randy.

27:19.387 --> 27:20.263
Randy...

27:20.889 --> 27:23.641
Randy and I...

27:23.725 --> 27:27.354
we had $25,000
we were gonna give to you, Julian,

27:27.437 --> 27:30.398
and honest...
But I lost it at the racetrack.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.193
You lost 25 grand at
the fucking racetrack?

27:33.276 --> 27:35.820
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-[overlapping conversation]

27:35.904 --> 27:38.198
-I was drunk, Julian. I was drunk!
-Julian, just...

27:38.281 --> 27:40.575
-take a deep breath.
-Now we have nothing, Julian.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.702
[slurring] We're totally broke.
If I ever... money,

27:42.786 --> 27:44.704
I would give it to you.
All of you, Julian.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.539
I'm sorry, so...
You can...

27:46.623 --> 27:48.541
pound the shit out of me
if you want to,

27:48.625 --> 27:52.003
but please don't fucking let Ricky
come every fucking day

27:52.087 --> 27:54.964
for the rest of our lives and
wreck our fucking trailer!

27:55.048 --> 27:57.133
-Okay, Julian...
-We'll fucking see, won't we?

27:57.217 --> 28:00.053
Take a deep breath, Julian.
Think hard about this.

28:00.136 --> 28:03.098
You think about the future that
we were just talking about.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.266
And if you hold him down
and pound on him,

28:05.350 --> 28:07.018
what's that going to accomplish?

28:07.102 --> 28:09.104
Nothing. Think.
Use your brains.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.856
What are you talking about,
pounding?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.025
It took a lot of balls
to tell me the truth.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.902
-Thank you, I appreciate it.
-There you go.

28:15.985 --> 28:17.570
-Let it out.
-You know what?

28:17.904 --> 28:19.864
We're all getting too old
for this bullshit,

28:19.948 --> 28:20.990
-okay?
-Yeah.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.076
And our lives are
finally coming together,

28:23.410 --> 28:25.328
and I'm getting married
for fuck's sakes.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.038
-There we go.
-Congratulations, Julian.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.498
-So, it's like...
-Look, just... Julian...

28:28.581 --> 28:30.041
I think what he's trying to say...

28:30.125 --> 28:32.919
and I speak for all three of us.
Boys...

28:33.586 --> 28:34.587
I do.

28:34.838 --> 28:38.466
We are willing to let
the past be the past.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.385
-Yeah?
-Right?

28:40.719 --> 28:41.636
That's great.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.304
-Right.
-Yeah, okay.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.056
For the future.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.642
-That's very gracious of you, guys.
-[clinking]

28:47.726 --> 28:50.520
-And, uh, I think I can speak for the...
-Ran...

28:51.146 --> 28:53.940
-Ran.
-Thanks, Mr. Lahey.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.485
As I was saying, I think I can speak
for the two of us too,

28:57.819 --> 29:00.447
and we agree,
the past is the past.

29:00.780 --> 29:03.992
Yeah, that's what I just said, Randy,
but good try, bud.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.661
-This is very exciting!
-Yeah!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.621
-A new era.
-[chuckling]

29:09.205 --> 29:10.206
Okay.

29:10.790 --> 29:11.666
[sobbing]

29:11.750 --> 29:14.669
-All right, you're sweaty, you smell.
-Might be too early for that type...

29:14.753 --> 29:16.546
-That's it, Randy!
-Okay, that's enough.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.881
Might be too early for that.

29:18.089 --> 29:20.216
I love you, Randy.
All right.

29:21.092 --> 29:23.636
-Thanks, Julian.
-Thanks, Julian.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.472
-Have a good night, fel...
-Whew.

29:25.555 --> 29:26.639
Ricky, Rick!

29:26.723 --> 29:28.558
[whispering] He shit himself.
He shit himself.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.728
So does that cancel
everything we just talked about?

29:32.979 --> 29:34.647
-No.
-[sighing]

29:36.816 --> 29:40.195
[theme music]

30:20.610 --> 30:24.239
[seagulls squawking]

30:35.208 --> 30:38.962
[fish]
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

30:39.045 --> 30:41.756
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

30:45.343 --> 30:46.886
[whisper]
Fuck.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.013
-[light clicks off]
-Fuck off.
