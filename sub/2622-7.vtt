WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:06.338
I just saw Kathy naked.

00:06.589 --> 00:08.382
It was like torture.

00:09.009 --> 00:13.012
If we go to war and you're captured,
you're in for a surprise.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.514
It keeps getting worse.

00:15.765 --> 00:19.018
I'm in love with
my roommate's girlfriend.

00:19.269 --> 00:24.189
Every time we're in the same room,
there's weird energy between us.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.151
Call me crazy, but
I think she likes me too.

00:27.402 --> 00:30.612
And now I have seen her naked.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.490
At least with her clothes on...

00:33.700 --> 00:37.036
...I could imagine her body
was covered in boils.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.749
But there are no boils.
She's smooth.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.251
Smooth!

00:47.380 --> 00:48.380
Wow...

00:48.548 --> 00:50.340
Could you see up his robe?

00:50.550 --> 00:52.885
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.728
- Here you go.
- I'll call you.

01:44.938 --> 01:45.979
Great.

01:47.732 --> 01:49.608
Hey, hey. Who was that?

01:49.818 --> 01:52.111
Casey. We're going out tonight.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.905
Going out? Wow.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.410
It didn't work out with Kathy? Bummer.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.954
No, things are fine.

02:02.205 --> 02:06.625
I'm having a late meal with her
after an early one with Casey.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.168
- What?
- Yeah.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.297
The craziest thing is,
I just ate a whole pizza myself.

02:12.841 --> 02:13.966
Wait...

02:14.217 --> 02:16.468
- You're going out with Kathy.
- Yeah.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.137
Why are you upset?

02:18.346 --> 02:19.763
Well, I'm upset...

02:20.056 --> 02:21.056
...for you.

02:22.642 --> 02:26.687
Sex with an endless line of women
must be unfulfilling.

02:28.898 --> 02:32.484
What's the big deal?
It's not like we're exclusive.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.153
Look, Joey.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.698
Kathy's not fulfilling
your emotional needs.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.158
But Casey...

02:39.409 --> 02:42.286
Granted, I just saw
the back of her head.

02:42.787 --> 02:46.081
But I got this sense
that she's smart and funny...

02:46.332 --> 02:48.542
...and gets you.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.379
You got all that
from the back of her head?

02:52.589 --> 02:54.631
It's time to settle down.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.633
Make a choice. Pick a lane.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.260
Who's Elaine?

03:03.141 --> 03:04.683
Little Tony Tarzan

03:04.934 --> 03:10.105
Swinging on a nose hair
Swinging with the greatest of ease

03:12.400 --> 03:14.151
I don't know the next verse.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.154
You could just go:

03:17.405 --> 03:18.614
Greatest of ease

03:18.865 --> 03:20.073
Ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma...

03:20.325 --> 03:21.825
Then go right into it.

03:22.785 --> 03:25.245
I like that.

03:25.413 --> 03:28.165
How do you know about
"ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?

03:28.666 --> 03:31.084
You know, I used to play.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.338
That's right. The keyboards?

03:34.547 --> 03:38.217
A little in high school.
I got into it in college.

03:38.468 --> 03:41.720
That's when I really found my sound.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.935
Juice just came out of my nose,
but it was worth it.

03:50.146 --> 03:51.563
Oh, my God.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.441
- I completely forgot about your sound.
- Yeah.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.611
He'd lock himself in the basement.

03:57.946 --> 04:01.698
No one was ever allowed to hear
"the sound."

04:02.158 --> 04:04.243
I want to hear "the sound."

04:05.245 --> 04:09.289
No, I mean, I haven't played in so long.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.834
Well, it's really personal stuff.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.295
Play that funky music, white boy.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.257
- Yeah, come on.
- No, you guys.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.386
My keyboards are all the way...
Yeah, okay.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.519
Okay, guys.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.438
All right. Bring it on, you.

04:37.068 --> 04:38.360
Here we go.

04:44.492 --> 04:49.288
You know, I've never played
my stuff for anyone before.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.999
It's important that you understand...

04:52.208 --> 04:54.584
...it's about communicating...

04:55.169 --> 04:58.171
...very private emotions.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.013
You know...

05:06.264 --> 05:10.183
You should think of my work...

05:10.435 --> 05:13.895
...as wordless sound poems.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.236
- That's what...
- My God, play.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.690
Well, you know, that was...

06:00.401 --> 06:01.485
...terrific.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.571
Really...

06:05.198 --> 06:06.615
...bitchin'.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.037
Wow. It was so wow.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.497
Really?

06:14.165 --> 06:18.585
Yeah. I mean, you should
play in public.

06:19.629 --> 06:22.089
Wow, thanks, you guys. That's...

06:22.298 --> 06:24.508
I want to play you another piece.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.885
Oh.

06:27.053 --> 06:31.431
I left my helicopter sounds
on another disk. I'll be back.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.104
This is so nice. I mean, I am so...

06:41.359 --> 06:44.611
God bless my dad
for soundproofing the basement.

06:46.280 --> 06:50.075
I can't believe I ever let him
touch me with those fingers.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.538
What are you guys talking about?
I loved it.

06:55.206 --> 06:57.124
It was so moving.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.836
It's so different
from the stuff you usually hear.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.754
You mean, music?

07:08.094 --> 07:09.469
I know what you think.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.390
Yes, yes, your breasts
are just as firm and juicy.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.018
Come in.

07:18.354 --> 07:19.354
Hey.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.731
Oh, God. Is that Baywatch?

07:21.983 --> 07:25.277
Yes, but I just watch it
for the articles.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.612
So is Joey around?

07:27.822 --> 07:29.906
No, he's not back yet.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.451
Come in, have a seat. Bow or stern?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.786
I don't have a preference. You?

07:35.121 --> 07:36.955
I like it in the stern.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.251
Of the boat.

07:43.379 --> 07:44.379
Hello.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.341
It's me. Casey and I
had a little car trouble.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.343
- What happened?
- We broke down.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.637
I have to get transmission fluid.

07:52.889 --> 07:56.600
Tell Kathy that I'm sorry
and I'll be there soon.

07:56.809 --> 08:01.354
- Why can't you tell her?
- I think my time is about to...

08:01.647 --> 08:03.148
Joey? Joey?

08:03.357 --> 08:04.357
Yeah?

08:07.445 --> 08:08.612
I thought your time ran out.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.323
Me too, but I guess I do have...

08:13.868 --> 08:17.996
Joey's running a little late,
and he says he's sorry.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.499
I guess it's just you and me, then.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.666
Oh.

08:22.251 --> 08:24.503
- Okay.
- Yeah, I think it is.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.175
So what'd you do today?

08:30.384 --> 08:32.010
I had an appointment
to cut my hair.

08:32.220 --> 08:35.096
- Looks great.
- And then it got canceled.

08:36.890 --> 08:37.974
I could cut it.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.558
Really?

08:39.769 --> 08:44.564
Yeah, I learned at my aunt's
dog-grooming shop. What do you say?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.566
Dog grooming?

08:47.026 --> 08:49.110
Don't make my tail too poofy.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.661
You have really great hair.

08:57.912 --> 09:00.372
Oh, thanks. I grow it myself.

09:06.504 --> 09:08.213
Joey also has great hair.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.423
Yes, Joey has great hair.

09:10.675 --> 09:15.095
I'm basically done here.
Let me get this hair off your neck.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.235
What are you doing?

09:31.195 --> 09:32.946
Checking if it's even.

09:33.531 --> 09:35.031
Okay.

09:37.702 --> 09:38.952
Looks good.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.791
The phone! The phone's making sounds.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.003
- Hello.
- Hey, dude, it's me.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.212
Hey, it's Joey.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.133
It looks like we'll be stuck here.

09:53.384 --> 09:56.970
I got the fluid.
The transmission wasn't there.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.389
- What?
- It fell out.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.017
I just figured we hit a dog.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.185
Okay.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.689
Could you put Kathy on?
I want to apologize to her.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.816
It's Joey.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.526
Hey...

10:11.736 --> 10:14.613
No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.741
Yeah, no, stop apologizing. It's okay.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.243
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.081
- I should probably go.
- Yeah.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.167
Yes. Yeah...

10:39.889 --> 10:41.890
I forgot my purse.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.475
Oh...

10:49.899 --> 10:52.567
I really did. I forgot my purse.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.660
- This is bad. It's bad.
- Horrible.

11:02.161 --> 11:04.871
Wait, the kiss or the situation?

11:05.915 --> 11:06.956
The kiss was good.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.876
- But that's bad.
- Here's what we do.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.045
- We forget it.
- What?

11:12.254 --> 11:17.300
We swallow our feelings, even if
we're unhappy forever. Sound good?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.969
Can you really do that?

11:20.388 --> 11:23.556
I have to. He's my best friend.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.350
And you're seeing him.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.561
Chandler, I like Joey a lot.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.271
But with you...

11:30.481 --> 11:32.565
No, don't. Don't, see?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.652
You're getting me confused.
I'm starting to yearn.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.448
I'm sorry.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.911
If you want to pretend that
nothing happened, I can try.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.331
I think we have to.

11:49.625 --> 11:50.709
Okay.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.754
- Bye.
- Bye.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.350
Are you still out there?

12:08.144 --> 12:09.728
No.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.989
Electrifying

12:23.576 --> 12:27.620
Infinite time

12:27.997 --> 12:31.124
There's a Starbucks
about three blocks down.

12:31.709 --> 12:35.378
He's so inspired.
Just look at him. Look at him go.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.355
Thank you very much.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.775
Hey, aren't you up next?

12:57.943 --> 13:01.404
- I'm not playing tonight.
- Why not?

13:02.448 --> 13:04.574
I can't follow Ross.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.952
It'd be like those
poor bicycle-riding chimps...

13:08.120 --> 13:11.206
...who had to follow the Beatles. No.

13:12.124 --> 13:15.293
Phoebe. Ross sucks.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.964
The place has emptied because of him.

13:20.299 --> 13:24.093
My God, he's not even
appreciated in his own time.

13:24.678 --> 13:28.473
I'd give anything to not be
appreciated in my own time.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.353
Okay. Phoebe...

13:35.231 --> 13:36.981
You suck too.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.652
Yeah, Phoebe.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.404
You're awful.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.076
You guys.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.995
You suck too.

13:56.418 --> 14:01.005
Man. I can't believe
I locked myself out again.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.299
Hang on, buddy.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.556
My God. What happened?

14:09.807 --> 14:12.642
- Did you do all this? Why?
- I sure did.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.521
It made me feel good to do
something nice for my friend.

14:16.730 --> 14:18.106
You're amazing.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.651
No, this is amazing.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.030
A TV appears from nowhere.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.908
The dream.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.953
How did you afford all this?

14:32.162 --> 14:35.206
I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

14:35.624 --> 14:38.167
You're the best friend
anyone has ever had.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.045
I don't know.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.463
No, you are.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.091
You do this, you give me advice...

14:45.301 --> 14:49.178
What you said about
focusing on one woman?

14:49.430 --> 14:50.513
I'll do that.

14:50.931 --> 14:51.931
With Casey?

14:52.141 --> 14:55.518
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.146
- Or Casey.
- No, Kathy.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.314
Could be Casey.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.607
No, Kathy.

15:00.774 --> 15:01.774
Consider Casey.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.030
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.033
I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

15:10.326 --> 15:14.621
That all the pieces of my life
are falling right into place.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.463
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:23.631 --> 15:27.926
You were really great.
You were really, really great.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.385
Thanks.

15:30.471 --> 15:35.183
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...

15:35.392 --> 15:37.560
...and, you know, my talent.

15:38.854 --> 15:39.854
Is that true?

15:41.565 --> 15:43.733
- Well, kind of, yeah.
- Pheebs...

15:43.984 --> 15:47.779
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...

15:47.988 --> 15:51.532
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.702
See, but...

15:54.954 --> 15:59.707
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.127
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.296
If it bothers you this much...

16:05.547 --> 16:09.133
...then I won't play anymore.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.054
No, don't do that.

16:13.305 --> 16:18.434
How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

16:21.355 --> 16:22.897
Yeah, okay.

16:28.529 --> 16:32.448
Hey, Chandler.
Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.826
Joey has the best boyfriend ever.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.788
I kissed Kathy.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.373
What? Are you serious?

16:40.582 --> 16:42.458
- Does Joey know?
- No.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.421
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?

16:47.214 --> 16:50.717
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.844
Which we all appreciate.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.682
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...

16:57.933 --> 17:00.435
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.646
Don't say that. That's not true, is it?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.441
- Yeah.
- He loves you.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.277
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?

17:09.778 --> 17:11.904
I said something to Phoebe.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.781
And I thought it was a really good idea.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.993
- Yeah, I remember.
- Oh, my God.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.371
What am I going to do?

17:20.622 --> 17:22.290
You'll have to tell him.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.041
Why do I have to?

17:24.376 --> 17:27.002
- Because you do.
- Yeah, I know.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.385
Would it be okay
if I wrote a song about this?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.893
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.936
Sambuca Margarita?

17:44.646 --> 17:46.147
It that a real thing?

17:46.398 --> 17:49.567
Well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.820
Listen, Joe. I need to...

17:53.072 --> 17:54.572
I need to talk to you.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.866
What's up?

17:58.285 --> 17:59.744
It's about Kathy.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.165
I like her.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.793
I like her a lot, actually.

18:07.753 --> 18:08.753
You do?

18:08.962 --> 18:09.962
Yeah.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.757
Your timing couldn't be better.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.801
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.135
What?

18:16.678 --> 18:20.848
- Yeah, she broke up with me.
- When?

18:21.141 --> 18:23.267
Just now, after acting class.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.271
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.735
Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?

18:32.986 --> 18:37.240
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?

18:37.491 --> 18:40.034
Yes, but I don't have to.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.954
No, it's okay.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.832
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:46.291 --> 18:49.418
You know why?
Because you came to me first.

18:51.880 --> 18:55.049
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.

18:56.051 --> 18:58.845
You might have your work
cut out for you.

18:59.054 --> 19:03.933
When I talked to her, I got the feeling
she's into some other guy.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.980
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.984
I think I know who the other guy is.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.443
Who?

19:16.196 --> 19:17.613
It's me.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.574
I'm the other guy.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.534
What?

19:22.744 --> 19:27.373
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

19:27.583 --> 19:30.334
...and one thing led to another, and...

19:30.544 --> 19:32.962
And what? Did you sleep with her?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.797
No, I just kissed her.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.091
What? That's even worse.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.761
- How is that worse?
- It's the same.

19:41.930 --> 19:45.349
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.559
Who cares?

19:46.810 --> 19:49.854
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you.

19:50.105 --> 19:53.399
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

19:53.609 --> 19:58.446
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.198
It's a dot to you.

20:00.782 --> 20:01.908
Yes.

20:02.075 --> 20:06.162
Yes, right. And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.831
Is that why you bought all this?

20:10.626 --> 20:11.834
You know what?

20:12.085 --> 20:14.503
I will not watch your TV.

20:14.755 --> 20:16.589
I won't listen to your stereo.

20:16.798 --> 20:21.093
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker
I won't eat. Know why?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.261
Because...

20:22.471 --> 20:25.014
It's all tainted with your betrayal.

20:26.600 --> 20:31.479
This apartment is empty to me.
I'm not happy about you, either.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.820
And just so you know...

20:40.405 --> 20:42.657
...I made that bread for you.

20:57.256 --> 21:00.049
Oh, my God. He's totally lost it.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.261
What?

21:03.553 --> 21:06.806
Phoebe. This cannot get any worse.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.101
Rats in the basement
are hanging themselves.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.779
Thank you. Thanks.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.826
I lost it.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.454
I won't play anymore.

21:30.664 --> 21:33.708
Would you... Can you finish my set?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.043
After that? Yeah.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.548
No, I mean, if I can help.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.556
Like I could lose it.

21:50.559 --> 21:54.186
- What?
- I played bad on purpose, guys.

21:54.396 --> 21:55.813
- Oh.
- Oh.

21:56.606 --> 21:58.858
You were playing bad this whole time.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.526
Just that last song.
