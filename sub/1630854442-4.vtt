WEBVTT

00:02.460 --> 00:03.712
Happy first day, Santa.

00:04.504 --> 00:06.047
Mom would be so proud of you.

00:06.047 --> 00:08.883
I brought you something called
"brewed jelly bean juice."

00:08.883 --> 00:11.219
Thank you, sweetie. Ooh. [sniffs] Mmm.

00:11.970 --> 00:12.971
Mm-hmm.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.848
That's very good.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.933
You know I'm gonna need it.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.728
After the whole EverythingNow!
delivery debacle,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.354
I just can't afford to mess this up.

00:21.354 --> 00:23.231
- You won't, Dad.
- Well, this is it.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.901
This is the day that I put on the coat
and gain all that weight

00:26.901 --> 00:29.070
and become Santa to all those elves.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.657
I need to let them know
that everything's under control.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.909
That nothing will escape me.

00:35.785 --> 00:37.245
Where's the Santa coat?

00:37.912 --> 00:38.913
Where's the coat?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.917
Maybe it's in the drawer.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.806
Okay! That's good.
We'll, uh, we'll ransack the place

00:56.806 --> 01:00.602
and then, uh, throw everything around
and make it look like a robbery.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.273
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Oh.

01:05.273 --> 01:06.649
Whoa. Oh.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.194
Lucas, I knew you were gonna like that.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.321
He's got those pj's
with the Buzz Lightyear on 'em

01:11.321 --> 01:13.698
that I thought was so-- They're c-cute.

01:13.698 --> 01:14.783
What did she--

01:14.783 --> 01:16.242
- Yeah, 'cause, you know...
- Oh.

01:16.242 --> 01:17.994
- Oh, hey there. Hi.
- No problem.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.412
- Good morning.
- Look at that.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.331
-"Funnuchinos." That's clever.
- Ooh. Yeah.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.792
You know, I'll have a "funnuchino."
A double one.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.835
And put some chocolate in there.
Mostly chocolate.

01:25.835 --> 01:28.129
No coffee. Just hot chocolate. Uh...

01:28.129 --> 01:31.424
Put cocoa in it instead of coffee.
Heavy cream if you got that.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.760
Ooh, put a little peppermint in there
if you have that.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.930
Any kind of hard candy, throw it in there.
And then whipped cream. Uh...

01:36.930 --> 01:40.725
Chop up some cookies if you have them.
Any one of these and, um, sprinkles.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.813
Coffee. Uh, black, please.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.065
- A name for the order?
- Santa.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.900
Sir, my job is hard enough.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.861
This is gonna be a bigger adjustment
than I thought.

01:51.861 --> 01:52.946
Yeah.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.489
- Ho ho ho.
- Oh.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.131
Hey, hey!

02:11.131 --> 02:14.342
Look at this room
full of little rock stars.

02:14.342 --> 02:17.011
Hmm. Little? [scoffs] Wow.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.263
Oh.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.932
You know what, my apologies,
that was-- that was very rude.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.433
Let's rock and roll!

02:22.433 --> 02:23.768
Yay!

02:23.768 --> 02:30.066
Now look, I might be the new Santa, okay,
but I am entering your world,

02:30.066 --> 02:33.611
and my hope is that
we can fly this plane together,

02:33.611 --> 02:36.072
or... [chuckles] ...should I say "sleigh?"

02:36.072 --> 02:38.950
Sleigh!

02:38.950 --> 02:42.328
The corporate synergy here,
by the way, is fire!

02:42.328 --> 02:43.830
I can feel the heat!

02:43.830 --> 02:48.042
My only goal here is to amplify
the brilliant, brilliant work

02:48.042 --> 02:49.419
that you're already doing.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.796
- We're all quarterbacks on this field.
- Touchdown!

02:51.796 --> 02:54.799
Together, we're gonna work hard,
and we're gonna play hard.

02:54.799 --> 02:57.760
Yay! They're both the same!

02:57.760 --> 03:02.140
I know it's still nine months away,
but he is not invited to my birthday.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.767
New Santa, can I have a hug?

03:04.767 --> 03:07.562
Uh, that sounds like a trap,
so I'm gonna say no.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.647
Weird. Okay.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.691
What time will you be tucking us in
at night?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.985
Are there any
less uncomfortable questions?

03:13.985 --> 03:15.320
Why aren't you wearing the coat?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.405
Yeah, where's the coat?

03:17.405 --> 03:20.533
We eliminated casual Friday,
like, 300 years ago.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.660
Thank you for the great questions.
Back to work, everybody!

03:22.660 --> 03:24.787
Yay!

03:26.581 --> 03:29.292
Sir, you really do have to wear the coat.
It's protocol.

03:29.292 --> 03:32.003
Sure. So, uh, Betty,
this is really not a big deal at all,

03:32.003 --> 03:35.298
but, um, I may have sort of,
uh, misplaced the coat.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.549
You what?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.969
Stay calm, Betty.
You've been through so much worse.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.180
Never had a mother. Never had a father.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.598
Can't we just replace it?

03:44.265 --> 03:47.518
It was made from
the robe of Saint Nicholas

03:47.518 --> 03:51.940
and passed down
from Santa to Santa ever since.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.816
So, no.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.443
Do you wanna go build a snow fort?

03:55.443 --> 03:56.569
He doesn't have time.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.447
We're already behind schedule,
and it's only 300 days till Christmas.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.786
- Oh. You're serious?
- Why does everyone always ask me that?

04:04.786 --> 04:06.120
 My turn. My turn.

04:06.120 --> 04:09.624
So, if I collected
six and a half orange tokens,

04:09.624 --> 04:13.836
I get to advance down your mine shaft
and steal all your sheep?

04:13.836 --> 04:15.630
- No clue.
- Look at this.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.967
Being Santa, I never got to spend
this kind of time with you guys.

04:18.967 --> 04:21.386
- I love it. Really, this is great.
- Me too.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.012
- I like it too.
- Yeah.

04:23.012 --> 04:27.600
So, I hate to be the bummer,
but the kids need to start school.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.935
Yes!

04:28.935 --> 04:31.771
- No. Don't vomit, don't vomit--
- Sandra, you're not gonna vomit.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.148
But we are gonna have to come up
with that backstory,

04:34.148 --> 04:35.775
'cause it's gonna be too many questions.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.320
- So, we're down to a shrimp boat family.
- I had a-- Mm-hmm.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.406
We were shrimping someplace
way off the coast.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.324
- Newfoundland, or something like that.
- Right.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.993
The other one was the Buddhist thing.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.078
It was a little complex,
but gives us a reason to be away.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.955
- Sure.
- I don't know about lost on an island.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.665
Just begs more questions. Trust me.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.417
- I think--
- We'll go with the shrimp--

04:52.417 --> 04:55.420
No, I think we have to go with
the Alaskan bush pilot.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.463
- That's what I told everyone at work--
- I like it.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.716
I'm an Alaskan bush pilot.
We already talked about it.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.302
- It's a great idea.
- Yeah. I'm-- I'm the bush pilot.

05:02.885 --> 05:04.220
And you know, here's the thing.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.598
I didn't want everyone at work to think
that I left this great job

05:07.598 --> 05:11.102
to be the nameless, faceless woman
behind a larger-than-life man.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.604
Hmm. 'Cause it's not true.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.648
- Okay. Listen, what are we gonna do?
- Okay.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.025
We got the eight-sided die.

05:17.025 --> 05:20.278
You roll it once, then there's
the six-sided one, flip the thing,

05:20.278 --> 05:22.572
- and now I gotta flip the sheep.
- No.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.324
How do I do that?
When do I flip the sheep?

05:24.324 --> 05:25.408
Oh, well...

05:26.117 --> 05:27.493
We looked at this. Not that page.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.329
- Where is it?
- It's that one in the middle.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.164
- In the middle. There we go.
- It's the red--

05:31.164 --> 05:32.415
Who reads German?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.837
Ooh, boy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.047
See you in my office!

05:39.756 --> 05:41.591
Whoa. Sorry, muscle memory.

05:41.591 --> 05:44.385
Yeah, detention. I used to like that.
That was a good memory for me.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.805
Oh, man! I'm actually inside
an American high school!

05:47.805 --> 05:49.974
It's everything I've ever dreamed of.

05:49.974 --> 05:53.686
You got your influencers,
your cybergoths, and your jocks.

05:53.686 --> 05:56.064
I mean, this is amazing.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.690
- Oh, my God!
- I'm so sorry!

05:57.690 --> 05:59.984
Oh, gosh!

05:59.984 --> 06:01.277
Are-- Are you all right?

06:01.277 --> 06:04.197
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just got cut from the softball team.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.408
Oh, uh, they're just jealous, okay?

06:07.408 --> 06:10.995
It's like when the elves told me I was
too tall to play jollyball with them.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.872
It'll be all right.

06:13.539 --> 06:14.665
You are strange.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.127
I, um, I guess I'll see you around, yeah?

06:18.711 --> 06:19.712
Yeah.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.005
Okay.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.803
High school is awesome!

06:26.803 --> 06:29.055
That wasn't my experience.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.474
Listen, you've been awfully quiet.
What's the matter?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.560
What did you bring?

06:35.853 --> 06:38.314
- Anything else?
- Yes.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.608
Hey.

06:40.608 --> 06:42.276
- Oh, great.
- Come on.

06:42.276 --> 06:48.533
Uh, listen-- Okay, let's-- let's just try
to act normal with a coat full of animals.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.494
Actually,
he prefers to be called a-a reptile.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.163
Whoa. Looks exactly the same.

06:54.163 --> 06:58.042
I can't believe my eyes.
I'm looking at a legend here.

06:58.042 --> 07:00.670
Okay, well,
let's not start a stampede with the kids.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.964
The Carol Newman.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.007
Oh, that-- that-- that legend.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.384
Vivian!

07:06.384 --> 07:07.468
Oh.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.429
You remember my husband, Scott.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.805
- Vivian.
- Not ringing a bell.

07:10.805 --> 07:13.474
So ironic 'cause
bells are such a big part of my life.

07:13.474 --> 07:14.892
- Yeah.
- I got coats with bells--

07:14.892 --> 07:17.186
- I wanna hear about being a bush pilot.
- Oh, yeah.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.355
Oh, especially the time you flew
through the avalanche

07:19.355 --> 07:20.940
to rescue your poor frightened husband.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.485
Yeah, that was an amazing story.
I'd like to hear that myself.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.570
- That's great.
- Yeah.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.613
I can't remember the plane.
It was kind of weird.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.575
- Like--
- Yeah, that was my Cessna.

07:30.575 --> 07:31.659
Nicely done.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.954
I was thinking, just looking around,
that I'd love to stay.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.622
- If-- If that's okay?
- Yeah.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.458
Sure. Sure. I got plenty of stuff to do.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.001
I'm gonna stop by some old haunts.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.003
- Stop by Circuit City, get us a VCR...
- Yeah.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.297
...and then to Blockbuster.
I'll rent some tapes for tonight.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.632
Anyway, ho ho ho ho ho.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.552
Ho, ho. Whoa.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.762
Whoa, do I have allergies to that.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.849
That's-- Ho ho. [coughs] Ho ho.

07:54.849 --> 07:55.933
- No.
- No.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.186
So, this is where the magic happens.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.355
Magic alone isn't enough to deliver
a billion toys in one night.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.191
Now you just stepped in it.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.943
Hugo's one of those elves
that believes in "science."

08:06.527 --> 08:09.447
Rumor has it he's originally
from the South Pole.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.658
Magic has its place,
but if you combine that

08:12.658 --> 08:18.206
with quantum physics, multiple dimensions,
parallel universes, vortexes,

08:18.206 --> 08:21.459
holes in the sky that Santa
can travel through, and boom!

08:21.459 --> 08:22.877
Joy to the whole world.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.004
- A billion deliveries in one night.
- Wow.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.215
If I had this kind of tech,
I would've killed it.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.927
Of course, only being able to deliver
on Christmas would've been a problem.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.429
Oh, with a couple adjustments,
this puppy can deliver anytime.

08:34.388 --> 08:35.973
We could do this year-round?

08:36.474 --> 08:39.894
Dad, you have that crazy look you get
whenever a new smartphone's released.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.605
- So, when people send us their orders--
- You mean lists?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.982
Sure. We can get them
what they want right away?

08:44.982 --> 08:46.734
Well, with our delivery system,

08:46.734 --> 08:49.529
we can get people what they want
before they even know they want it.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.242
Dad. Crazy eyes.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.296
Memorial Day is awesome.

09:07.296 --> 09:10.550
Parties, barbecues, games and fun.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.302
- What are we "memorial-ing?"
- Fallen soldiers.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.387
What?

09:15.471 --> 09:17.056
Why are we having a picnic?

09:17.682 --> 09:18.683
All right!

09:18.683 --> 09:22.144
We can officially get this party started
because Carol's here.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.064
- I am so happy to see you.
- How about me-- Yeah.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.651
Oh, my goodness, you guys!
Oh, it's been forever. Hi.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.695
Mom is like the Dad of this place.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.530
Yes! Oh, my goodness.
Such a pleasure.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.073
- And this is--
- Huh.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.366
Oh. Oh, hey!

09:36.701 --> 09:38.828
Hey. I-I haven't seen you around school.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.414
Oh. So you were looking for me.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.666
- Uh--
- I transferred to another school.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.710
Made the softball team, so, uh, yay.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.545
Nice.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.297
My name's Riley, by the way.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.341
Cal. It's short for Calvin. Calvin Calvin.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.094
Your name's Calvin Calvin?

09:55.886 --> 09:57.555
Yeah. It-- It-- It's a problem.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.557
Well, my full name is Buddy Calvin Claus,

09:59.557 --> 10:01.309
but you know how many elves
are named Buddy?

10:01.309 --> 10:02.768
It gets confusing, you know?

10:02.768 --> 10:03.853
Elves?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.480
Kids! Kids. Kids. What'd I-- What'd I say?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.941
Uh, anyway, it wasn't a problem
going by my middle name

10:08.941 --> 10:10.860
until we changed our last name to Calvin.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.112
- Oh. Changed your last name?
- Yeah.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.032
All right, so you in the, uh, the Witness
Relocation Program or something?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.783
- Something like that. Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.536
Anyways, tell me about you.
What kind of human stuff do you do?

10:21.370 --> 10:24.123
Have you been to a bank,
like, with money and stuff?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.375
Yeah.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.294
Sandra, you're killing me here.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.130
- You're not even trying to make friends.
- What do you call that squirrel?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.174
That's a rat with a big bushy tail
that likes nuts.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.385
Okay, and what about you? I don't see you
trying to make any friends.

10:36.385 --> 10:39.013
I'm a 60-year-old man.
We don't make friends at this age.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.848
That's nature's way of keeping us cranky.

10:40.848 --> 10:43.100
I thought you said
we were gonna do this together.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.311
All right. You're right.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.564
And that sounds like an elf scream, and
that's exactly why I left the North Pole!

10:48.564 --> 10:50.858
Look out! Runaway horse!

10:51.859 --> 10:53.611
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.281
Hey, hey! Sandra, what are you doing?
Sandra! What are you doing?

10:57.281 --> 10:59.116
Hey! Come here! Sandra!

11:05.164 --> 11:06.999
Whoa! Whoa!

11:06.999 --> 11:08.501
It's okay, boy. It's okay.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.423
Oh, wow, girl.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.258
That was crazy impressive riding.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.343
Weren't you scared?

11:17.343 --> 11:20.096
No. The horse was scared,
so I had to show him I wasn't.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.265
It's true.
I was scared. I saw a bee.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.601
- What did you say?
- What did who say?

11:25.601 --> 11:27.561
Oh, crud. It's happening here too?

11:27.561 --> 11:30.564
Hey, I'm Jada.
That's Hannah and MacKenzie.

11:30.564 --> 11:31.649
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:31.649 --> 11:35.736
We sort of have this riding club.
You wouldn't wanna join us, would you?

11:35.736 --> 11:37.738
Do walruses love belly rubs?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.700
I would love to join your club. Yeah.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.327
- Did you see that?
- Yes!

11:43.327 --> 11:45.788
Sandra saves the day,
and she's making friends.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.123
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
- I'm kind of riding high as well.
- Yeah, what about?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.795
Yeah, so the district is opening
a new charter school, and...

11:54.004 --> 11:55.548
they want me to be in charge of it.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.802
Well, listen, I haven't said yes yet.
Um, and-- and I don't have to.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.179
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Of course I'm gonna be okay.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.681
I've had my time in the spotlight.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.017
It's your turn to shine now,
and I'll just-- I'll sit in the dark.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.145
- Didn't sound good, did it?
- No.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.690
Elves. My beautiful elves.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.986
My beautiful, forever-young elves.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.073
Who wants to give me some of your blood?

12:21.073 --> 12:24.076
I'm just kidding!
Come on, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.704
Question for you:
What's your favorite day of the year?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.414
Christmas!

12:28.414 --> 12:32.126
And what is your least favorite day
of the year?

12:32.126 --> 12:34.253
Every other day!

12:34.253 --> 12:40.134
And now, what if I told you
that we could make Christmas every day?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.303
- Wow.
- How?

12:44.764 --> 12:48.267
Using the North Pole's delivery system
and EverythingNow!'s algorithm,

12:48.267 --> 12:49.852
we can make that dream a reality.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.812
Christmas, 365.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.648
Giving everyone whatever they want,
whenever they want it!

12:54.648 --> 12:56.025
Think about it, okay?

12:56.025 --> 12:59.278
Christmas every day would diminish
the true specialness of Christmas.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.363
I know, Noel.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.866
It's like how being tickled is
the most fun thing in the world,

13:03.866 --> 13:06.410
but after a week of being tickled,
you start throwing up.

13:06.911 --> 13:10.080
I once tickled you for two weeks straight,
and you never threw up.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.916
Yeah, that was a bad example.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.169
I'm just saying Christmas every day
isn't really Christmas.

13:15.836 --> 13:19.673
I know. But letting new Santas
find their footing is part of our job.

13:19.673 --> 13:22.760
Santas need to figure out on their own
what they're doing wrong.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.513
- And if Fake Santa Simon doesn't?
- ...want when they want it.

13:25.513 --> 13:30.601
And that is how Christmas every day
will make the North Pole relevant

13:30.601 --> 13:32.019
for the next millennia!

13:35.940 --> 13:37.316
Can I have a hug, Santa?

13:37.316 --> 13:40.736
You know what? This time it's fine.
Bring it in. Everybody, come on!

13:40.736 --> 13:42.446
Oh.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.490
There we go.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.160
So strong. Very strong. Wow.

13:48.953 --> 13:49.954
That's good.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.418
There we go. Very strong.

13:58.128 --> 13:59.463
That's good.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.341
So then, I'm like,
"Whoa, I can't game with you guys,

14:02.341 --> 14:07.054
then study for my geometry finals
and volunteer at the community center!"

14:07.054 --> 14:08.180
- What?
- Yeah.

14:08.681 --> 14:11.433
That sounds like my day. It's, like,
been pedal to the metal all day.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.477
But plenty of time for my family.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.896
Who's up to play
that terrible sheep game again?

14:16.522 --> 14:18.941
I'm sorry.
I'm hanging out with the horse girls.

14:20.484 --> 14:22.903
Human girls!
Not female horses, just to be clear.

14:22.903 --> 14:24.613
And I have plans with Riley too, so...

14:24.613 --> 14:25.573
Oh.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.826
Oh! You know what? I forgot.
I've got that science committee meeting.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.661
Right. Right. You know what?

14:30.661 --> 14:35.833
Perfect, 'cause what I'll do is, uh,
I guess I will clear the table.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.793
'Cause many hands make light work.

14:37.793 --> 14:42.298
And three trips would be six hands,
so in a way, if you do it yourself,

14:42.298 --> 14:44.508
- it is making light work.
- See you after horse girls.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.885
- Bye. Have fun.
- Later!

14:45.885 --> 14:48.804
We got mail already. Got mail.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.061
Yeah.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.902
We launched our Christmas Every Day
promotion in a few test markets,

15:02.902 --> 15:06.363
and the results so far are off the charts!

15:06.363 --> 15:07.448
That's right!

15:07.448 --> 15:10.701
Everything is on schedule
to go global by November.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.912
- But that's in a couple weeks.
- It sure is.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.040
Hmm. Are we sure this feels right?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.666
Oh, well, what do you all think?

15:17.666 --> 15:22.004
Santa! Santa!
Santa! Santa! Santa!

15:22.004 --> 15:23.547
Santa, we need to talk.

15:23.547 --> 15:24.632
Give us the room.

15:29.511 --> 15:33.098
Bets, I should've hired elves years ago.
They're so enthusiastic.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.893
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's not like I'm anti-union.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.228
- What's a union?
- Oh, man. I love this place.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.608
Sir, two elves didn't show up
for work today.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.610
Okay, I mean,
people miss work all the time.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.945
Not in the North Pole.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.322
No elf has ever not shown up for work.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.406
Ever.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.825
One time we thought Hugo
was trying to pull a "Blue Flu,"

15:51.825 --> 15:54.036
but turned out he had just eaten
too many M&M's.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.496
Blue ones, if that wasn't clear.

15:57.206 --> 15:58.415
I sort of stopped listening.

15:59.041 --> 16:02.002
Sir, Christmas Every Day, it's a bad idea!

16:02.002 --> 16:04.463
It gives people nothing
to look forward to.

16:04.463 --> 16:09.677
It ruins the spirit of giving,
togetherness and specialness.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.930
And no one's going to know
when to watch <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.598
It's going to ruin Christmas.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.849
Hard disagree, Bets.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.060
Let me show you this. I did the analysis.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.313
Christmas has been on the downswing
for years now.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.857
In fact, idea percolating,

16:23.857 --> 16:30.072
what if, instead of Christmas Every Day,
we called it C.E.D.?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.783
Sir, I think you're being a bit reckless.

16:32.783 --> 16:36.245
Also, your eyes are moving in ways
I've only seen in cartoons.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.623
Okay, genuine question:
Am I in charge, or are you?

16:40.207 --> 16:43.752
- You are, sir. I can only advise.
- Cool, cool. Okay.

16:43.752 --> 16:46.922
Um, so look, I started this business
because I wanted everyone

16:46.922 --> 16:49.049
to have everything they wanted
when they wanted it.

16:49.800 --> 16:53.721
Bets, it was aspirational,
but now it can be a reality.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.016
Why don't we just try it this way?

16:57.016 --> 17:00.227
And look, if it doesn't work,
we'll go back to the old way. Okay?

17:01.145 --> 17:02.521
Oh, Betty, Betty.

17:03.814 --> 17:04.982
You're a rock star.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.778
No, sir. You're a rock star.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.660
Betty. Honeybuns. Come in!

17:17.661 --> 17:19.079
What the heck?

17:19.997 --> 17:22.666
I thought you were gonna stop
Fake Santa Simon,

17:22.666 --> 17:24.626
not call him a rock star.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.379
Crumpet and Barnabas spoke out against
the changes around here,

17:27.379 --> 17:28.839
and now they're gone.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.341
Did they run away, or were they sent away?

17:31.341 --> 17:33.802
- I don't know.
- You need to go get Santa Scott back.

17:33.802 --> 17:35.971
That's not how it works. I can't.

17:35.971 --> 17:39.183
I figured as much,
so I'm taking matters into my own hands.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.226
Oh, for the love of Mike and Ikes.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.980
Santa Simon, I challenge you to a duel!

17:44.980 --> 17:46.065
Aw!

17:46.065 --> 17:48.567
That's adorbs,
but Daddy's working right now.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.277
Maybe-- Maybe Grace can play.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.781
This isn't a game. This is a legit duel.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.867
- Loser leaves the North Pole.
- What?

18:02.164 --> 18:03.165
Thank you?

18:04.249 --> 18:05.250
This is ridiculous.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.836
Ridiculous? Maybe.

18:07.836 --> 18:10.506
But what you're doing is wrong.
And you know it.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.217
That's why you don't bring Grace
with you to work anymore.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.511
You leave Grace out of this, okay?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.889
She's just been, uh,
been busy doing stuff.

18:18.889 --> 18:21.183
You know, she's just--
just doing kid stuff.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.976
You lie like a gnome.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.313
Noel, that is enough nonsense.

18:26.313 --> 18:30.818
Go home, take a nice long bubble-gum bath
and we'll talk about this later.

18:40.452 --> 18:41.453
Men.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.499
<i>My darling, I hate fighting with you.</i>

18:45.499 --> 18:49.461
<i>I know your teensy-weensy hands are tied
by ancient North Pole bylaws,</i>

18:49.461 --> 18:51.463
<i>so I guess it's up to me to do something</i>

18:51.463 --> 18:55.717
<i>before fake, stupid-head Santa Simon
destroys our way of life.</i>

18:55.717 --> 18:59.471
<i>Pardon my French, but I am</i> "très angré."

19:00.055 --> 19:03.725
<i>If you need me,
the walrus knows where I am. Noel.</i>

19:17.364 --> 19:18.365
Betty?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.576
Are you in here?

19:20.576 --> 19:23.453
You're so tiny,
it's hard to tell sometimes.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.874
I think I may have been
too harsh with you.

19:48.061 --> 19:49.062
Carol?

19:52.858 --> 19:53.859
Oh, my God.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.154
Hey! How are you? Look at you!

19:57.154 --> 19:59.448
- What are you doing here?
- I'm taking you back.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.241
- What?
- Simon's destroying Christmas.

20:01.241 --> 20:04.286
Come on. Destroying Christmas? You know
how many times you said that to me?

20:04.286 --> 20:07.080
Remember the time I put the phone
in the sleigh? You didn't like that.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.041
How about the time
we buzzed Rockefeller Center,

20:09.041 --> 20:12.044
and the tree had a little bend at the top,
"That's the end of Christmas!"

20:12.044 --> 20:13.545
- He has all these crazy plans!
- Yeah.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.005
Like making it Christmas every day!

20:15.005 --> 20:18.133
Listen, Simon deserves the right
to be the Santa of his choosing, right?

20:18.133 --> 20:20.719
Just like I deserve the right
to be the dad I was meant to be.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.930
I think you wasted a trip.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.182
Okay, look. Come on. Stop, stop.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.476
Listen, I got to be honest with you.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.521
Okay, I missed you.
You wanna hang out for a little bit?

20:31.521 --> 20:32.814
- I'd love to stay!
- Good.

20:32.814 --> 20:35.817
No way I'm going back to the North Pole
while Fake Santa Simon is there.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.444
I want nothing to do with that guy.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.863
- Hey, I got a job.
- As what?

20:41.281 --> 20:43.575
- Sir, we have a problem.
- Oh, hi, Betty!

20:44.201 --> 20:45.953
Oh, Grace, I didn't see you there.

20:46.453 --> 20:49.206
You know, the gingerbread men
are redesigning their house

20:49.206 --> 20:50.874
to make it more open-concept,

20:50.874 --> 20:53.126
and there's this whole wall
just waiting to be eaten.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.379
- You should go check it out.
- Oh, Daddy, let's go!

20:55.379 --> 20:57.756
Uh, honey, Daddy's working very hard
for you right now.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.550
Why don't you go ahead
and, uh, bring me back a window?

21:03.220 --> 21:06.723
Sir, the stable elf disappeared,
and there's an issue with the reindeer.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.768
They don't seem to want to fly,
or maybe they can't.

21:10.352 --> 21:14.022
I haven't seen them this out of it since
the day after the '64 TV special aired.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.401
This in addition to elves deserting.

21:17.401 --> 21:21.738
Sir, the only kind of "deserting" elves
know how to do is eat a cinnamon roll.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.073
Well, then where are they?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.826
I wish I knew, but more are gone.

21:26.910 --> 21:32.916
AWOL elves and nonflying reindeer
are a reflection of leadership.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.669
- I agree.
- Yeah, this falls on you, Betty.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.506
And so close to December too.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.966
I guess it's good for everyone

21:40.966 --> 21:43.885
that Christmas itself doesn't
really matter much anymore, huh?

21:53.145 --> 21:54.396
Have you seen Noel?

21:55.272 --> 21:57.107
He didn't come home last night.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.775
Usually, Zippy calls me

21:58.775 --> 22:01.570
and tells me if he's had one too many
at the hot cocoa bar,

22:01.570 --> 22:02.863
but Zippy's gone too.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.614
Men, am I right?

22:05.907 --> 22:08.076
I just don't believe he would leave
without telling me.

22:08.076 --> 22:12.039
Yeah, well, like I said. I-- You know,
I don't know anything about that, so...

22:15.042 --> 22:18.420
<i>If we make it through December... ♪</i>

22:18.420 --> 22:20.505
 Making the rounds with you again
has been fun...

22:20.505 --> 22:23.216
- Mm-hmm.
- ...but working for EverythingNow?

22:23.216 --> 22:24.426
What are we doing?

22:24.426 --> 22:27.554
What we always do.
Spreading joy at the holidays, right?

22:27.554 --> 22:30.766
But the closer we get to Christmas,
the less deliveries.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.769
Yeah, I got to admit,
it's not as festive as I remember.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.604
Because of Fake Santa Simon.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.857
He's not "Fake Santa Simon."
He's the real Santa now.

22:38.857 --> 22:41.651
And he's not gonna become a great Santa
without his number one.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.403
You're still the number one.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.365
So, you got to go back to the North Pole
and help this guy, all right?

22:46.365 --> 22:47.824
And you got to deal with Betty.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.618
- I can't go back.
- Yes, you can.

22:49.618 --> 22:53.038
I told you, I left her the note,
and she still hasn't come looking for me,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.415
- which means she doesn't care anymore.
- She cares about you.

22:55.415 --> 22:59.211
You kids will work it out.
Hell, you've only been married 900 years.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.129
Thousand-year itch
is right around the corner.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.672
That's true.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.133
You know what? This is home now.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.385
We're all real happy here.

23:06.385 --> 23:10.222
Unholy night!
Murray's been decapitated!

23:12.849 --> 23:15.435
I never knew this kind of evil existed.

23:15.435 --> 23:18.105
Well, listen, Chicago's not for everybody,
and we can fix him.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.981
We'll just put his head back on the body.

23:20.982 --> 23:24.277
There's footprints.
So we know it wasn't a suicide.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.863
Someone bit his nose off
like a little snack!

23:26.863 --> 23:29.324
- Hmm.
- What kind of monster eats a carrot?

23:29.324 --> 23:32.702
Hippies and vegans. Hippie vegans.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.497
Hey! You! You're ruining my work of art.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.500
We're just spreading a little Christmas
spirit here on my property, boys.

23:38.500 --> 23:41.461
Uh, wait a minute. Jimmy Mercer.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.755
Tinkertoys, that's your thing, right?

23:43.755 --> 23:45.424
Who cares about Christmas anymore?

23:45.424 --> 23:48.343
Hey, hey, hey.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.928
Oh, now you've done it.

23:50.762 --> 23:54.099
You just messed with the greatest
snowball thrower of all time.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.517
Mr. San-- Oh!

23:56.268 --> 23:59.438
No more Mr. Nice List now.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.441
Oh! Oh!

24:02.441 --> 24:04.317
- I just pulled my arm out.
- Santa!

24:04.317 --> 24:06.445
I'm not the man I used to be.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.530
You're not a man. You're my hero!

24:09.239 --> 24:11.575
Cover! Cover!

24:11.575 --> 24:14.453
It's been an honor!
Nice knowing ya.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.080
Ow! Ow!

24:23.545 --> 24:28.258
Wow. It's not even 7:00 p.m.
That was more like a 9:00 p.m. sigh.

24:28.258 --> 24:31.094
I just got fired for getting into
a snowball fight.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.971
- Did you win?
- I used to be somebody.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.557
- At least, I thought I was somebody.
- What are you talking about?

24:35.557 --> 24:38.351
- Get your shoes off the bed.
- I was thinking a lot today about flukes.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.521
It was just a fluke
that I'm even Santa Claus.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.315
That guy could've slid off anybody's roof.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.151
And then I get married to you.
I love being married to you.

24:46.151 --> 24:50.280
That's because of the Mrs. Clause.
I just go one clause to another, you know?

24:50.280 --> 24:52.073
- Hmm.
- I'm out of clauses now.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.910
Well, you have
the "Get Your Shoes Off the Bed" clause.

24:54.910 --> 24:57.287
Oh, yes, there is that.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.373
I thought coming back to Chicago,
I would just start where I left off here.

25:00.373 --> 25:02.292
You know, we'd hit the ground rolling.

25:02.292 --> 25:03.877
Spend time with my kids.

25:03.877 --> 25:06.588
But they have their friends,
and you have your job.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.672
Principal.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.592
You're the best principal in Chicago,
because that's what you're good at.

25:10.592 --> 25:15.013
Well, you just need to figure out
what you're good at.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.354
Hey, this is beyond anything
I've ever dreamed of.

25:23.063 --> 25:26.149
C.E.D. is a great success,
and it's all thanks to you.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.402
My elves who haven't complained
and-- and run away!

25:30.237 --> 25:32.822
We have something called
an accounting department now?

25:32.822 --> 25:36.159
Are we charging people?
That's not what we do!

25:36.159 --> 25:39.454
Why don't you give it a chance, okay?
If you don't like it, we'll stop.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.289
But I have a feeling
you'll feel differently

25:41.289 --> 25:43.458
when you're living in
that big mansion on the hill.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.669
No. We're running out of time.

25:46.419 --> 25:50.257
This measures Christmas spirit.
Look how dark it's getting.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.468
When the last of the light goes out,
Christmas is extinguished.

25:54.719 --> 25:58.848
That's it. Something's been off,
and now I know what it is.

25:58.848 --> 26:02.143
New Santa is destroying Christmas spirit!

26:02.143 --> 26:05.146
What are you talking about?
No, I'm not. I'm making more of it.

26:05.146 --> 26:07.482
Christmas isn't supposed to be every day!

26:07.482 --> 26:09.234
It's about anticipation.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.779
Counting down the days with paper chains
or cheap waxy chocolate.

26:12.779 --> 26:15.615
It's about going to bed
with butterflies in your stomach,

26:15.615 --> 26:19.035
knowing you'll finally wake up
to presents under the tree.

26:19.035 --> 26:22.122
Christmas is about goodness! Love!

26:23.707 --> 26:28.628
Having faith in something...
...you can't see.

26:30.463 --> 26:32.507
I don't feel too good.

26:35.844 --> 26:40.473
Speaking of something you can't see,
I can't see Edie!

26:40.473 --> 26:41.683
It's okay.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.854
There is a logical explanation
for everything, except this.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.857
Commence panicking!

26:48.857 --> 26:51.359
Well, hang on, everybody, all right?
This is perfectly normal.

26:51.359 --> 26:54.487
In the entire history of the North Pole,

26:54.487 --> 26:58.408
an elf has never
just vanished into thin air.

26:58.408 --> 27:02.454
I've known there was something rotten from
the second you stepped foot in the North--

27:02.454 --> 27:04.080
Oh, no.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.795
First, you lose the coat. Now this.

27:10.795 --> 27:13.006
I gave you enough leeway.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.176
As Head Elf,
I will no longer allow you to continue.

27:16.176 --> 27:18.136
Well then, Bets,

27:19.429 --> 27:23.683
it looks like your days
as Head Elf are over.

27:25.018 --> 27:26.686
You're fired.

27:28.438 --> 27:29.522
No.

27:54.381 --> 27:59.094
<i>Bella?</i> Come. Come, come, come.

27:59.094 --> 28:03.014
I never thought that I would see you here.

28:04.015 --> 28:06.935
I suppose you are looking
for the Santa coat?

28:06.935 --> 28:08.019
You took it?

28:08.019 --> 28:11.648
No! It came here on its own.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.274
It did?

28:14.275 --> 28:15.652
By itself.

28:17.570 --> 28:18.947
I think it's safer here.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.409
Then why did you come?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.077
I need to get in touch with him.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.580
Oh. Scott Calvin? You let him retire.

28:28.164 --> 28:30.625
That was a little bit of
a whoopsie-doodle for you, eh?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.043
Not him.

28:34.087 --> 28:35.338
Him.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.512
Oh. Where did all this come from?

28:42.512 --> 28:45.598
Well, it might have been me.
I was thinking about what you said.

28:45.598 --> 28:50.437
That I should do what I do best.
And what I do best is Santa Claus.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.857
So it's now time for me to demonstrate
that, now and forever,

28:53.857 --> 28:56.860
I will be Santa Claus for my family.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.819
- Mmm.
- Oh.

28:57.819 --> 28:58.903
Thanks, Dad.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.488
Well, I got to say,

29:00.488 --> 29:03.366
all these Christmas decorations
are making me a little homesick.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.243
That's what I'm getting at here.

29:05.243 --> 29:09.789
What I'd like to do is maybe have
an old-fashioned North Pole Christmas,

29:09.789 --> 29:11.249
if-- if you guys have the time.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.334
No, that seems wonderful.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.795
And we could get out
that Flip the Sheep game,

29:15.795 --> 29:18.006
and we could finally make it
through the instructions.

29:18.006 --> 29:21.092
Cal, you know, you can bring
some buds over if you want,

29:21.092 --> 29:22.177
or even ask Riley.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.762
Oh, that's a big step.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.639
You know, game night with your family.
Next stop, marriage.

29:26.639 --> 29:29.267
Oh, please.
You two haven't even kissed yet.

29:29.267 --> 29:31.436
All these months,
and you haven't kissed her, huh?

29:31.436 --> 29:35.899
Well, not everyone dates for six minutes
and then, you know, gets married like us.

29:35.899 --> 29:39.068
Thank you. It's not like I know what
I'm doing when it comes to girls. Like--

29:39.068 --> 29:40.487
I can help you there.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.238
Uh, you're gonna teach me how to kiss?

29:42.238 --> 29:43.782
This should be interesting.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.158
I am not gonna do that.

29:45.158 --> 29:47.327
I was thinking you might
help me do the tree.

29:47.327 --> 29:49.621
Oh, awesome! Yeah, I've missed that.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.872
- Okay.
- Yeah, me too.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.373
Well, know what they say?

29:52.373 --> 29:53.750
"Elves gotta elf!"

29:53.750 --> 29:56.169
All right, well, our elf is out
getting some ice cream,

29:56.169 --> 29:58.880
but I think we could start
working on the tree.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.257
So, the first time in 29 years...

30:02.342 --> 30:05.261
...I'm going to spend Christmas
with my family.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.138
- Oh, Scott.
- Thank you, Dad.

30:07.138 --> 30:10.183
Okay. Everybody, take an ornament.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.353
Take the big ones, and you start
on the bottom. We're gonna do that...

30:16.815 --> 30:18.817
Oh, God. This can't be good.
