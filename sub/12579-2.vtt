00:36.161 --> 00:39.324
Dad, I didn't get to bed
until 3:00 this morning.

00:39.865 --> 00:43.266
I was watching the Taxi marathon
on Nick at Nite.

00:43.402 --> 00:44.960
[Imitating Latka Gravas]
Thank you very much.

00:45.070 --> 00:48.369
Bobby, in this house you don't get to
sleep through your summer vacation...

00:48.473 --> 00:52.534
and watch what were probably repeats
all night like some shut-in.

00:53.245 --> 00:55.805
Here. I've put together a chore list.

00:56.081 --> 00:59.778
And I made sure to alternate
between light and heavy chores.

00:59.885 --> 01:02.183
Weed-pulling is not a light chore.

01:02.287 --> 01:05.313
Yes, it is.
I just purchased a new weed-puller.

01:06.091 --> 01:09.652
Well, actually,
I wouldn't mind trying that out first.

01:10.162 --> 01:13.188
And don't worry about the garage door.

01:13.298 --> 01:15.357
I'll paint that this weekend.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.735
I'm not giving you my chores,
you're getting a job.

01:19.838 --> 01:22.636
Okay. Though I'm not very employable.

01:22.774 --> 01:26.505
No skills, bad attitude,
seventh-grade education.

01:26.678 --> 01:28.168
But we can try.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.512
Hello, Peggy Hill.

01:36.622 --> 01:39.614
Well, Minh, I'm surprised to see you here.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.784
I've been donating blood for a long time.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.657
I'm what they call a universal donor.

01:44.863 --> 01:49.095
Type O. I can give blood to anyone.
My blood that important.

01:49.201 --> 01:53.137
Well, I am AB negative,
the rarest blood of all.

01:53.305 --> 01:54.704
Liquid gold!

01:54.806 --> 01:59.607
Mrs. Hill, our records show that you have
donated a total of six pints of blood.

01:59.711 --> 02:02.009
I want you to know
that when you've reached eight pints...

02:02.114 --> 02:03.672
Or one gallon.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.976
Yes, or one gallon, we will give you
a complimentary coffee mug.

02:08.086 --> 02:12.489
A mug? And it would say
that I gave blood, right?

02:12.724 --> 02:17.218
Yes. And Mrs. Souphanousinphone,
you're only one pint away from the mug.

02:17.629 --> 02:19.392
Hear that, Peggy Hill?

02:19.498 --> 02:22.365
Next time I'll be drinking orange juice
from a coffee mug...

02:22.467 --> 02:27.029
while you still drinking it from
the little itty-bitty Peggy Hill paper cup.

02:32.144 --> 02:34.203
Stealing company gas, Hank?

02:35.614 --> 02:36.842
Good one.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.812
Mr. Strickland, I was wondering...

02:40.919 --> 02:44.377
if it'd be okay to put Bobby to work
for the summer as a tank wipe?

02:44.489 --> 02:47.686
No, it's too late.
I promised the last tank-wipe job...

02:47.793 --> 02:50.626
to Miz Liz's brother's stepson's kid.

02:50.729 --> 02:51.889
But I'll tell you what.

02:51.997 --> 02:56.434
If Bobby works half as hard as you,
I'll pull a few strings, grease a few palms...

02:56.535 --> 02:59.026
and get him a job as a caddy
at the golf club.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.129
Well, that would be great, sir.
You know, I love golf.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.800
Maybe if, you know, sometime...

03:04.910 --> 03:07.879
I mean, I know you love golf, too,
and I thought...

03:07.979 --> 03:11.506
No, Hank. You're too old to be a caddy.
Get back to work.

03:14.386 --> 03:17.446
Well, hey, Minh.
I just thought you'd like to know...

03:17.556 --> 03:22.323
that I've donated another pint of blood.
Seven pints apiece, Minh.

03:22.427 --> 03:26.454
But not for long.
I am on a donating streak.

03:26.998 --> 03:27.965
[Grunting]

03:42.047 --> 03:45.414
The trick to being picked by a golfer
is to make sure you make eye contact.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.109
Look alert. They like that.

03:47.219 --> 03:50.416
If you don't get picked,
you end up sitting on your butt all day.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.217
Thanks for the tip.

03:53.658 --> 03:55.285
Yeah. Let me see.

03:57.896 --> 03:58.920
Kid.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.769
[Car horn playing
Deep in the Heart of Texas]

04:06.004 --> 04:08.837
Hey, Mr. Strickland. Nice to see you, sir.

04:08.940 --> 04:10.498
Here you go, Bradley.

04:10.609 --> 04:14.602
Hey, you. Bring me a martini
on the first tee. Two olives.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.341
- Hey, Bobby. How're they treating you?
- Good, sir.

04:17.449 --> 04:21.112
Well, now you can tell them
Buck Strickland treats you better.

04:26.525 --> 04:29.619
After work we're gonna hang out
and wash some golf carts.

04:29.728 --> 04:32.196
And we're gonna ride some blocks of ice
down a hill.

04:32.297 --> 04:35.596
Well, I'm not really interested
in washing carts.

04:35.801 --> 04:40.067
But you give me a shout when
you're ready to do that ice-riding thing.

04:44.509 --> 04:45.840
Okay. You want to go first?

04:45.944 --> 04:47.912
Me? Sure. What the hey?

04:50.315 --> 04:51.907
Now, how do I...

04:53.985 --> 04:56.579
You are ice-blocking, my friend. Yeah!

05:03.895 --> 05:06.125
Do you know who you knocked down?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.255
The chairman
of the Membership Committee.

05:08.366 --> 05:11.563
Yeah, that's right. Corky Raywood.

05:11.670 --> 05:14.104
I'd be wetting myself, too, right now
if I were you.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.667
[Doorbell rings]

05:17.042 --> 05:20.375
Sir, your son was involved
in an incident near green number six.

05:20.478 --> 05:23.470
A club member was incapacitated
due to ice-blocking.

05:23.582 --> 05:26.710
Your son's services as a caddy
have been terminated.

05:26.818 --> 05:30.310
Oh, God, Bobby. Mr. Strickland is my boss.

05:30.422 --> 05:33.357
He put his reputation on the line
to get you this job.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.586
Also, sir, your truck is parked
more than one foot from the curb.

05:36.695 --> 05:38.822
- I'm giving you a warning.
- You're not a cop.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.194
That's why it's just a warning.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.367
Corky Raywood may have
a deep thigh bruise...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.998
but the real victim here is Mr. Strickland.

05:51.109 --> 05:54.670
You owe that man an apology.
I'll wait out here.

05:56.781 --> 05:58.612
I'm really sorry, sir.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.411
I don't know if you've ever ridden
a block of ice before.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.011
Well, I married Miz Liz, didn't I?

06:05.924 --> 06:08.188
Now, don't you worry, Bobby.
I'll take care of this.

06:08.293 --> 06:10.659
But that security guy said I was fired.

06:10.762 --> 06:12.662
Then that security guard's fired.

06:12.764 --> 06:15.198
- No, please don't...
- Too late. He's fired.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.167
Sorry, Bobby. I was making a hot toddy
before you showed up.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.000
You want a hot toddy?
A hot toddy will calm your nerves.

06:21.106 --> 06:24.303
- No, thank you, sir.
- Miz Liz! Two hot toddies!

06:24.609 --> 06:27.874
We're gonna toast your new job
as my personal caddy.

06:28.747 --> 06:32.683
Now, tell me, Bobby, did you really knock
that son of a bitch on his ass?

06:32.784 --> 06:34.877
You know, he tried to get me kicked out
of the club...

06:34.986 --> 06:36.385
for throwing my putter at his wife?

06:36.488 --> 06:39.355
No one sneezes
when Buck Strickland's about to putt.

06:39.457 --> 06:40.924
Except for Buck Strickland.

06:44.296 --> 06:46.526
I'm gonna make him my personal caddy.

06:46.631 --> 06:49.498
Well, gee, thank you
for doing this for me, sir.

06:49.601 --> 06:51.569
Not doing it for you,
I'm doing it for Bobby.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.467
He reminds me of my boy.

06:53.571 --> 06:54.833
I didn't know you had a son.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.101
Yeah. Lives in a different town,
different woman.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.403
Name's Roy, Ray, something like that.

06:59.511 --> 07:02.309
After 16 years,
I'm too embarrassed to ask.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.985
Eighteen holes.
I've never walked that far in my life.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.645
Well, you're not gonna start now.

07:10.755 --> 07:13.747
Toss those clubs in the cart
and take the driver's seat.

07:13.858 --> 07:15.849
- You hungry, Bobby?
- Yes, sir, I am.

07:15.961 --> 07:18.657
Well, how's a couple of hot dogs
with everything on them sound?

07:18.763 --> 07:20.060
Fantastic!

07:25.870 --> 07:27.098
Damn it!

07:28.940 --> 07:32.341
- You playing army golf today, Vargas?
- Army golf?

07:32.444 --> 07:34.776
Yeah. Left, right, left, right.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.881
Good one, sir.

07:39.985 --> 07:41.452
Yahoo!

07:41.920 --> 07:44.184
Sent that whore home in a taxi!

07:46.091 --> 07:49.219
I had a dream last night
where we were all naked.

07:49.561 --> 07:51.119
Except for you, Hank.

07:51.229 --> 07:54.665
You had these tiny, clear,
plastic underpants on.

07:55.367 --> 07:59.861
Actually, they weren't doing you any good,
really, because you could see everything.

07:59.971 --> 08:01.495
But the weird part is...

08:01.606 --> 08:03.335
Look. There's Bobby.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.010
See you tomorrow at the club, Bobby.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.911
You didn't ask Mr. Strickland
to give you a ride home, did you?

08:11.016 --> 08:14.213
He insisted.
And he tipped me a dead president:

08:14.419 --> 08:15.647
Hamilton.

08:15.754 --> 08:17.221
Way to go, Bobby.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.654
Mr. Strickland's not one
to throw his money around.

08:19.758 --> 08:22.454
He rewards hard work with a fair salary.

08:25.397 --> 08:27.922
Look at you, Hank. You are so jealous.

08:28.033 --> 08:31.867
When was the last time you were
dropped off at home by your boss?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.130
Never.

08:34.672 --> 08:38.972
So then, when Buck finally sunk his putt,
he tried to do a little dance...

08:39.077 --> 08:41.705
but he's kind of too big,
so he had me do it for him.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.304
Everybody loved it.

08:44.416 --> 08:47.351
Well, while Buck's out enjoying himself
on the links...

08:47.452 --> 08:50.080
I'm just glad he's got someone like me
at the shop...

08:50.188 --> 08:52.247
to keep the trains running on time.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.790
Take today, for instance.

08:53.892 --> 08:57.225
We got a surprise call
from the Propane Association.

08:57.328 --> 09:00.297
They needed to talk to Buck.
Well, I handled it.

09:00.398 --> 09:02.593
Told them that would be fine.

09:03.068 --> 09:07.266
Yep, that's just the kind of fires I have
to put out when Buck's not around.

09:07.906 --> 09:09.669
Anyway, it was some game.

09:09.774 --> 09:13.574
Mr. Strickland got up under more balls
than a midget hooker.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.667
Bobby!

09:14.779 --> 09:17.873
Where did you learn language like that?
The television?

09:17.982 --> 09:19.643
No, Mr. Strickland.

09:19.751 --> 09:23.209
Just because you're his caddy
does not give you the right to repeat it.

09:23.321 --> 09:25.152
Take it easy, Old Top.

09:26.324 --> 09:29.691
God dang it, it's 7:15.
I'm missing The Wheel.

09:33.598 --> 09:37.329
Sir, last night at dinner
Bobby used some language...

09:38.169 --> 09:39.796
Sorry. I didn't...

09:40.939 --> 09:45.069
Yeah, no. Look, yeah, I got to go.
Your daddy just walked in the room.

09:45.176 --> 09:47.667
Hank, you want to say hi to your son?

09:48.513 --> 09:50.811
No, but I'm glad I can talk to you both.

09:50.915 --> 09:55.750
Mr. Strickland, Bobby used some language
last night that he said he got from you.

09:55.854 --> 09:57.253
Is that true, Bobby?

09:57.355 --> 09:58.322
Uh-huh.

09:58.590 --> 09:59.557
Uh-huh.

10:06.631 --> 10:08.929
All right then, Bobby.
I'll see you at the club.

10:09.033 --> 10:10.500
That it, Hank?

10:14.706 --> 10:17.834
I'm sorry, ma'am. But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to send you home.

10:17.942 --> 10:20.308
Your blood pressure is way too low.

10:20.545 --> 10:21.512
Oh!

10:21.613 --> 10:23.274
Darn. No mug for Minh.

10:23.381 --> 10:25.474
Did you give blood recently?

10:25.683 --> 10:28.880
Yes. But so did she. Twice!

10:29.220 --> 10:30.278
See!

10:30.922 --> 10:33.015
You do not have to take it
from a vein in my arm.

10:33.124 --> 10:35.615
You can take it
from one in the back of my leg.

10:35.727 --> 10:39.185
Both of you go home.
And I'm not giving you a mug.

10:39.297 --> 10:40.662
You can have a cookie.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.223
I do not want a cookie. I want that mug.

11:00.852 --> 11:04.379
Come on. What are you waiting for?
Let's save some lives!

11:05.123 --> 11:07.182
You ready to lose, Pratley?

11:10.528 --> 11:11.756
Look out.

11:13.331 --> 11:16.459
Shoot. Now, where did that
little son of a gun get to?

11:16.568 --> 11:18.832
It's over here, Mr. Strickland.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.175
I almost broke my neck
tripping over that ball.

11:35.186 --> 11:37.518
Well, isn't that cheating, Mr. Strickland?

11:37.622 --> 11:39.886
I'm not gonna lie to you, Bobby.

11:40.225 --> 11:44.321
No. It's just being clumsy.
There's no law against being clumsy.

11:44.629 --> 11:47.097
That is, unless you're caught.

11:47.532 --> 11:48.556
[Buck laughing]

11:52.904 --> 11:53.871
[Splashing]

11:53.972 --> 11:54.939
[Geese squawking]

11:55.039 --> 11:56.631
Go find the ball, Bobby.

11:56.741 --> 11:58.003
Find it some place good.

11:59.444 --> 12:02.538
BUCK: Well, see you later, Bobby.
Remember to soak those feet.

12:02.747 --> 12:05.841
So, Bobby, I thought
that maybe we'd go golfing tomorrow.

12:05.950 --> 12:06.974
Just the two of us.

12:07.085 --> 12:08.052
Uh-huh.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.719
Give your mother a chance to recuperate.

12:10.822 --> 12:11.789
[Weak moan]

12:12.090 --> 12:15.617
I can't, Dad. Buck asked me
to caddy for him this weekend.

12:15.727 --> 12:18.389
And we are teeing off at 9:00 tomorrow.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.655
Isn't that Mr. Strickland's watch?

12:20.765 --> 12:23.495
It's my watch now.
He gave it to me as a gift.

12:23.601 --> 12:25.899
Buck Strickland does not give gifts.

12:26.004 --> 12:29.963
I've worked for the man over 15 years
and he's never given me anything.

12:30.074 --> 12:32.542
[Weakly] That's true, Bobby. Never has.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.344
Mr. Strickland probably just lent it to you.

12:35.446 --> 12:39.576
No. He gave it to me for helping him
get the best score of his life.

12:40.018 --> 12:42.509
- What did he shoot?
- A 65.

12:42.754 --> 12:44.984
What? Well, that's a course record.

12:45.089 --> 12:46.317
He was having some trouble...

12:46.424 --> 12:50.360
but I bailed him out
with my trusty "hand wedge."

12:50.461 --> 12:51.792
Bobby, you cheated.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.992
There was money on the game.
Besides, Lane Pratley's a horse's ass.

12:56.968 --> 12:58.868
You're giving that watch back.

12:58.970 --> 13:01.564
No, I'm not.
Mr. Strickland gave me that watch...

13:01.673 --> 13:04.164
and it's Mr. Strickland
who gives me my money.

13:04.275 --> 13:06.869
He asks me to jump and I say,
"How high?"

13:06.978 --> 13:09.503
He asks me to cheat
and we're on the green in two.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.481
Well, there is no getting around the rules
in this house.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.711
If you like cheating and lying so much,
why don't you go to Buck's house?

13:15.820 --> 13:18.846
- All right, maybe I will.
- Fine. I'll drive you.

13:18.956 --> 13:21.823
- Hank, what are you doing?
- I know what I'm doing.

13:21.926 --> 13:24.622
Well, it sounds like you know
what you're doing.

13:24.729 --> 13:28.893
But I am still too lightheaded
to really fully comprehend your plan.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.194
Buck's no baby-sitter.

13:30.301 --> 13:33.464
He'll turn Bobby away
the minute he sets foot on his doorstep.

13:33.571 --> 13:35.664
All right,
I can't handle a thousand details, Hank.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.400
Just give me the broad strokes.

13:51.255 --> 13:52.586
Hey, Bobby!

14:04.268 --> 14:06.236
Did Bobby phone home yet?

14:06.471 --> 14:09.599
- Where is Bobby?
- Well, he's still at Buck's.

14:09.707 --> 14:13.803
But believe me, after a couple of hours
without his nightlight and humidifier...

14:13.911 --> 14:16.106
he'll be begging to come home.

14:29.861 --> 14:34.093
Hello, Lupino. Sorry to disturb you.
I need to talk to Mr. Strickland.

14:34.198 --> 14:36.860
Mr. Strickland went
to Hot Springs, Arkansas.

14:36.968 --> 14:40.836
I press his gambling suit
and I pack his naked-lady playing cards.

14:40.938 --> 14:42.838
He goes last night with Mr. Hill.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.841
- I'm Mr. Hill.
- Little Mr. Hill.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.974
Dang it!

14:48.079 --> 14:52.345
All right.
If Mr. Strickland calls, you tell him...

14:52.817 --> 14:54.876
I'm taking a personal day.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.421
You ever been to the dog races, Bobby?

14:58.523 --> 15:01.151
Not one as organized as this.

15:01.826 --> 15:05.227
Do they still let the monkeys
ride the dogs around the track?

15:05.329 --> 15:07.354
No, not since the '40s.

15:07.465 --> 15:11.265
Nothing like seeing a monkey
whip a dog down the backstretch.

15:11.836 --> 15:14.134
Bobby, you're gonna be my wallet caddy.

15:14.238 --> 15:16.433
Now, don't lose it.
I got all my betting money in there.

15:16.541 --> 15:17.565
Okay!

15:17.675 --> 15:20.735
Okay, now, I just put our money
on Wonderdog.

15:20.845 --> 15:22.142
I like that name.

15:22.246 --> 15:25.147
Yeah. I saw Wonderdog dump a load
before the race.

15:25.249 --> 15:26.682
Means he'll run light.

15:26.784 --> 15:29.582
Look out, folks. Here comes the bunny.

15:30.154 --> 15:32.520
- Go, Wonderdog!
- Go, Wonderdog!

15:35.993 --> 15:39.087
Wallet caddy, hand me my wallet.
We're going again!

15:40.531 --> 15:42.999
PEGGY: [Weakly] Hey, Minh.

15:45.269 --> 15:47.499
Down here, Minh.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.704
That's not real! You made that yourself!

15:54.812 --> 15:56.643
They wouldn't take any more blood
from you.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.511
Well, maybe not in Arlen.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.709
Maybe not in McMaynerbury.

16:02.353 --> 16:05.948
But, Minh, there's a little town
called Houston.

16:06.357 --> 16:09.087
And when that construction crane
fell over...

16:09.193 --> 16:11.320
they didn't have time to ask questions.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.487
You're lying!

16:12.597 --> 16:15.464
I would not be down here gloating
if I were.

16:16.033 --> 16:19.833
I think I'll go inside and brew some coffee.

16:19.971 --> 16:20.995
[Minh muttering angrily]

16:22.640 --> 16:25.666
Yep. That's gonna taste sweet.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.417
Now, you see, your daddy wouldn't know
how to have a good time like this.

16:36.521 --> 16:38.785
No, sir. He would not.

16:39.023 --> 16:40.285
Hey, old-timer.

16:40.391 --> 16:43.554
Do you know where Rooster's crap game
is tonight?

16:44.028 --> 16:46.428
Rooster's crap game
is between Fourth and Fifth Street.

16:46.531 --> 16:49.830
Go around the back.
Knock twice and slip $20 under the door.

16:49.934 --> 16:52.266
You ever see someone fish for $40, Bobby?

16:52.370 --> 16:53.928
- No.
- Watch this.

16:57.708 --> 17:01.235
Look at him go!
He makes in a year what I make in a week.

17:02.513 --> 17:03.980
[Solemn instrumental music]

17:05.148 --> 17:07.344
Thanks for letting me know
that my taillight was out.

17:07.451 --> 17:10.249
Well, I'd want you to do the same for me,
Officer.

17:10.354 --> 17:13.152
Say, can you tell me
how much further it is to Hot Springs?

17:13.257 --> 17:14.723
Another hour-and-a-half.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.726
- All right. Drive carefully now.
- I will.

17:25.036 --> 17:26.002
[Alarm sounding in distance]

17:27.070 --> 17:29.198
[Cat shrieking]

17:30.408 --> 17:31.875
[Jazz music playing]

17:41.052 --> 17:44.317
- Kid can't come in.
- It's okay. He's my son.

17:44.422 --> 17:47.414
I don't care whose son it is.
Kid can't come in.

17:47.525 --> 17:50.653
All right.
Bobby, you're gonna have to stay out here.

17:50.761 --> 17:54.197
I'm gonna take half my betting money,
you hold onto the rest.

17:54.298 --> 17:56.061
Here. Hold onto my heart pills.

17:56.167 --> 17:59.159
If I'm losing my shirt in there,
I'm gonna fake a heart attack.

17:59.270 --> 18:02.205
Now, that's your cue to come in
waving the pills, screaming:

18:02.306 --> 18:06.174
"My daddy's having a heart attack!"

18:07.678 --> 18:09.111
You got that?

18:11.082 --> 18:14.017
- Now, who's my wallet caddy?
- I am.

18:14.118 --> 18:15.483
There we go!

18:34.171 --> 18:36.071
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

18:36.173 --> 18:37.800
Come on, baby. Forget about him.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.809
You're lucky my woman doesn't want me
to fight, you little freak...

18:40.911 --> 18:42.845
or I'd mess you up good.

18:45.016 --> 18:49.146
I am hot, Bobby!
I just hit the five three times in a row!

18:49.353 --> 18:52.288
- Do you think I should press the five?
- I don't know.

18:52.823 --> 18:53.790
[Vomiting]

18:53.891 --> 18:57.952
- Mr. Strickland, how much longer do you...
- Screw it! I'm gonna press the five.

18:58.062 --> 19:02.897
Luck is with me tonight, Bobby.
I'm on the gravy train with biscuit wheels.

19:04.235 --> 19:06.669
- You all emptied out, Carla?
- Yeah.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.872
Oh, God!

19:16.180 --> 19:18.444
Okay, kid, hand over the money.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.608
My daddy's having a heart attack!

19:21.719 --> 19:23.710
Your daddy already tried that.
We're not buying it.

19:23.821 --> 19:26.221
- Now, give us the money.
- And the watch.

19:26.323 --> 19:27.950
But the watch is mine.

19:28.059 --> 19:31.460
Your daddy said you'd give us the money
and the watch.

19:36.167 --> 19:37.930
Now, come on, kid. The watch.

19:38.035 --> 19:39.627
The watch is mine!

19:43.974 --> 19:45.874
You get what you needed, Rooster?

19:45.976 --> 19:47.739
That boy give you the money
and the watch?

19:47.845 --> 19:50.541
The boy gave us the money,
took off with the watch.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.980
What? God dang it, Bobby.

19:55.786 --> 19:57.777
I think I'm having an infarction!

19:57.888 --> 20:00.823
Look through his pockets.
And take his shoes.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.666
It's my watch.

20:20.277 --> 20:23.246
Back off. I'm this boy's father.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.905
I thought the old guy was his father.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.573
No. This one's my dad.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.380
This one right here.
The one with the golf club.

20:37.428 --> 20:40.226
Here. Take the watch.

20:40.598 --> 20:42.532
I don't want it anymore.

20:46.036 --> 20:49.096
The quicker we're out of Hot Springs
the better.

20:53.611 --> 20:56.910
Keep your distance. I just need some air.

20:58.983 --> 21:01.918
You heard me.
I'm having a goddang heart attack!

21:02.019 --> 21:03.850
Mr. Strickland, get in.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.248
Get him.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.923
What are you waiting for, Hank? Go!

21:10.227 --> 21:11.694
Yeah!

21:12.029 --> 21:14.657
Come and get me, you sons of bitches!

21:17.334 --> 21:19.063
Come on, step on it!

21:22.640 --> 21:26.132
Yeah! That's right, you backwater hicks!

21:26.243 --> 21:29.007
You missed Buck again!

21:29.113 --> 21:31.104
[Buck whooping]

21:33.217 --> 21:36.414
So, I guess I'm gonna be punished.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.782
You're darn right.

21:37.888 --> 21:41.824
First of all, you will not be caddying
for Mr. Strickland anymore.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.521
Second of all, you're grounded
for the rest of the summer.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.461
Thanks, Dad.

22:26.871 --> 22:29.203
Miz Liz! Two hot toddies!
