Dr. Steere found that 25%

about Lyme disease,

18:26.690 --> 18:28.734
I was really interested
in an article

18:28.775 --> 18:30.152
that came out in 1989

18:30.194 --> 18:32.321
written by a neurologist,
Andrew Pachner.

18:32.362 --> 18:35.324
His article was called
"Lyme disease, the New 'Great Imitator.'"

18:35.365 --> 18:37.951
And in that article,
he presented six cases

18:37.993 --> 18:39.369

There was one case

18:49.087 --> 18:51.006
So why was Lyme disease

18:51.048 --> 18:52.424
called
"the new great imitator?"

18:52.466 --> 18:55.135
Because the first
great imitator was syphilis.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.804
Syphilis was caused
by a spiral-shaped organism

18:57.846 --> 18:59.223
called a treponeme,

18:59.264 --> 19:02.935
and Lyme disease is caused
by a spiral-shaped organism.

19:02.976 --> 19:06.438
Syphilis caused a huge variety
of manifestations.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.024
So it mimicked other diseases.

This organism knows
how to change forms.

19:43.642 --> 19:46.186
It knows how to hide.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.313
And the way it evades
the immune system--

19:48.355 --> 19:51.817
Lyme is more difficult
to find on the blood tests.

19:51.859 --> 19:54.736
- And many of us clinicians
were observing that.

19:54.778 --> 19:58.073
Patients that we strongly
believed had Lyme disease,

19:58.115 --> 20:01.076
their standard tests
for Lyme disease were negative.

20:01.118 --> 20:04.246
And as a result, it is easy
for people to honestly,

20:04.288 --> 20:07.165
you know, confuse Lyme
for other conditions.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.793

So it's a very,
very complex organism,

When I was looking for answers
for Lyme patients,

41:31.909 --> 41:33.785
I discovered
that there were multiple reasons

41:33.827 --> 41:35.037
why people stayed ill.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.914
It was like going
to a doctor's office

41:36.955 --> 41:40.000
with 16 nails in your foot,
saying you have foot pain.

41:40.042 --> 41:41.502
And the doctor
pulls out one nail

41:41.543 --> 41:42.920
and says,
"Come back in a month."

41:42.961 --> 41:44.630
You still have 15 nails
in your foot.

41:44.671 --> 41:45.881
You're gonna have pain.

41:45.923 --> 41:48.383
Some of it is that the Lyme
organism is persisting,

41:48.425 --> 41:50.761
but part of it
is also other infections.

41:50.802 --> 41:52.721
Right now, there are
at least 18 different

41:52.763 --> 41:54.848

You know, the most common
coinfections that we see

42:02.564 --> 42:05.776
that make people ill is Lyme,
babesia, and bartonella. Right?

42:05.817 --> 42:07.528
And when you
put them all together,

42:07.569 --> 42:09.947

"We need to put out

48:41.213 --> 48:43.131
And there was some urgency
to do something.

I mean, there's
Lyme disease out there.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.719

"Well, we're not ready,

provide the language."

if you will.

49:25.757 --> 49:27.593
How are you gonna
undo something?

49:27.634 --> 49:29.052
Who's gonna back off?

49:31.513 --> 49:33.098

I've seen people

49:33.140 --> 49:34.766

or inadequate treatment.

and their brains,

49:45.569 --> 49:49.156
at their organs,
until they succumbed.

49:49.198 --> 49:52.743
So it's a very complex situation,

49:52.784 --> 49:55.037
and the insurance companies
have made use

49:55.078 --> 49:58.582
of that complexity
to their economic advantage.

49:59.333 --> 50:02.628
- In my opinion, no way
was her care experimental.

50:02.669 --> 50:05.339
Her care was absolutely
medically necessary.

50:05.380 --> 50:07.633
And the necessity of it
was demonstrated--

50:07.674 --> 50:09.343
whenever she stopped
being treated,

50:09.384 --> 50:12.095
she would deteriorate
in objectively measurable ways,

50:12.137 --> 50:14.139
and when she got treated,
she would improve

without the treatment
that she needed,

50:21.104 --> 50:24.983
and during that time,
her condition deteriorated.

50:25.025 --> 50:27.069
One of her last stays
at Northern Westchester,

50:27.110 --> 50:29.613
I undertook a long interview
with her.

50:29.655 --> 50:32.616
Vicki, you want to take

50:32.658 --> 50:35.202

of grand mal seizures.

51:14.241 --> 51:16.118
mouthed to her, "I love you."

51:16.159 --> 51:19.621
And within a few days,
you know,

51:19.663 --> 51:21.123
she was dead.

51:23.584 --> 51:26.545
Vicki's case
was reported in the--

51:26.587 --> 51:28.547
in the "New York Times'"
Science Times,

51:28.589 --> 51:30.924
I think in August of 1993.

51:30.966 --> 51:34.052
I fully expected that,
you know,

51:34.094 --> 51:35.554
that would be a turning point.

51:35.596 --> 51:38.891
And it's just incredible to me
that here we are,

01:13:51.889 --> 01:13:53.517
- Now, why is that important?

01:13:53.559 --> 01:13:56.562
When you take away
the 31 and 34 bands,

01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:58.897
which are highly specific
for Lyme,

01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:00.816
you're then taking away
the possibility

01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:03.402
for those people
who've not had the vaccine

01:14:03.443 --> 01:14:05.737
to help diagnose this disease.

01:14:05.779 --> 01:14:07.656
So if you come
to a doctor's office,

01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:10.534
"Doc, I got a swollen knee.
I can't walk. I'm tired.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:13.161
My memory's not working.
I've seen 20 doctors,"

01:14:13.202 --> 01:14:15.371

in their Western blot

01:14:15.414 --> 01:14:17.583
and they've got four
out of five bands,

01:14:17.624 --> 01:14:21.128
but your fifth band happens
to be the 31 or 34,

01:14:21.170 --> 01:14:23.755
they would call that
a CDC negative Western blot,

01:14:23.797 --> 01:14:25.966
yet you have Lyme disease.

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:30.846
- There is a vaccine,

01:14:30.888 --> 01:14:35.434
but now there are reports
of serious side effects.

01:14:37.477 --> 01:14:40.564
- By the late 1990s,
there were two companies

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:44.318
making two competing vaccines
that were almost identical.

01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:47.404
One of them got mired
in lawsuits

01:14:47.446 --> 01:14:49.573
because people claimed
there were side effects,

01:14:49.615 --> 01:14:54.870
and it was pulled from the market,
leaving only LYMErix.

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:57.080
There were a lot of unanswered
questions about LYMErix.

01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:59.666
The FDA panel that passed it,

01:14:59.708 --> 01:15:02.252
they said that there are
a lot of unknowns here,

01:15:02.294 --> 01:15:05.088
but they were passing it
through anyway.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:08.675
- The safety issue here seems
to me to be very complicated

01:15:08.717 --> 01:15:11.553
compared to any vaccine I know
that has been licensed.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:13.388
Those who did the trial
have unearthed

01:15:13.430 --> 01:15:16.225
some very interesting,
sinister possibilities

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:18.143
that may or may not be real.

01:15:18.184 --> 01:15:22.147
And as I said earlier,
rare events will become common

01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:25.025
when a million people
are vaccinated.

01:15:25.067 --> 01:15:27.528
- I might comment that this
is fairly rare for a vaccine

01:15:27.568 --> 01:15:30.112
to be voted on
with so much ambivalence.

01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.907
So that is all
for the formal vote.

01:15:34.117 --> 01:15:35.869
- In the years
since it's been on the market,

01:15:35.911 --> 01:15:37.621
600,000 people have taken it.

01:15:37.663 --> 01:15:42.501
Nearly 300 adverse reactions
have been reported to the FDA.

01:15:42.543 --> 01:15:45.170
- Panel of experts
that advises the FDA

01:15:45.212 --> 01:15:47.673
found the story so compelling
that it asked the agency

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:50.008
to carry out
a large-scale investigation

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:52.344
of possible harmful effects
of the vaccine.

01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:55.681

01:15:55.722 --> 01:15:59.101
I was actually invited
to go to that meeting.

The star witness
at this FDA meeting

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:06.066
was the chief scientist
for the Connaught vaccine.

01:16:06.108 --> 01:16:09.027
So you got it? Like--like, there was
Glaxo and Connaught.

01:16:09.068 --> 01:16:11.029
Connaught pulled out.

01:16:11.071 --> 01:16:14.782
He said, "Since LYMErix
has been given out

01:16:14.825 --> 01:16:17.160
"to so many people,

this vaccine is very effective,

and it's very well-tolerated.

01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:44.271

01:16:57.451 --> 01:17:00.579
- In April, the manufacturer
of a Lyme disease vaccine

01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:03.248
took it off the market,
citing poor sales

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:06.627
following unproven allegations
of side effects.

01:17:07.835 --> 01:17:11.423

We have not had a Lyme disease

If you were bitten

Many people have

01:17:37.074 --> 01:17:40.994

it's easy to diagnose,
it's straightforward to cure.

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:49.419

that prevails today.

In order to qualify a vaccine,

01:20:49.892 --> 01:20:53.478
it's much more helpful to have

where you can easily tell
who has the disease

and who doesn't
have the disease.
