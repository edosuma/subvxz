WEBVTT

00:11.042 --> 00:12.662
All right, Level 10!

00:12.842 --> 00:14.462
We better not lose this time.

00:14.662 --> 00:16.692
Dude, quit messing around and we'll beat it.

00:16.692 --> 00:18.042
Last time wasn't my fault!

00:18.042 --> 00:19.602
Whatever, just take it seriously!

00:19.602 --> 00:21.962
Triple thugs! Triple thugs! Beat them up!

00:22.092 --> 00:24.142
Triple thugs! Triple thugs!

00:24.712 --> 00:26.342
Eat on that! Triple thugs!

00:28.222 --> 00:30.842
Oh no, not this guy! We never beat this guy!

00:30.842 --> 00:32.962
Dude, we're gonna do it this time. Come on,

00:32.962 --> 00:34.222
hit him! Hit him!

00:34.222 --> 00:36.062
I am hitting him! Nothing's happining!

00:36.062 --> 00:38.062
Aw, dude! Try kicking him in the junk!

00:38.062 --> 00:40.022
Kick him in the junk! Kick him in the junk!

00:40.022 --> 00:41.192
I'm kicking him in the junk!

00:41.192 --> 00:42.322
Well, keep doing it!

00:48.862 --> 00:51.032
I told you we were gonna do it! I told you!

00:51.032 --> 00:52.602
I knew we were gonna make it.

00:52.602 --> 00:55.022
Yeah right. That's not what you said 20 hours ago

00:55.022 --> 00:57.422
when you were whining about how hard the game was.

00:57.962 --> 01:00.562
Look! We made it to the final level!

01:00.562 --> 01:02.412
Dude, do you know what this means?

01:02.412 --> 01:03.162
We're dead?

01:03.162 --> 01:05.232
No, we have to beat The Hammer.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.762
What was the slogan of this game again,

01:06.762 --> 01:07.902
"Nobody Beats The Hammer"?

01:07.902 --> 01:10.722
Yeah right. More like nobody has even seen The Hammer.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.142
Well, get ready to live.

01:12.142 --> 01:14.032
He's probably gonna come out of those doors!

01:14.372 --> 01:16.322
Nobody beats The Hammer!

01:16.322 --> 01:17.662
It's The Hammer!

01:18.352 --> 01:19.672
Hit him! Hit him!

01:23.502 --> 01:25.652
Man, our hits aren't doing anything!

01:25.652 --> 01:27.222
I know, my thumbs are killing me!

01:31.672 --> 01:33.662
Just one of his hits takes a whole life!

01:36.102 --> 01:38.112
Run away dude, run away!

01:38.112 --> 01:39.432
Don't let him touch you man!

01:39.582 --> 01:40.872
I'm not, I'm not!

01:42.252 --> 01:43.962
Rigby, help me!

01:48.162 --> 01:50.452
Dude, his weakness is furniture.....furni-

01:51.832 --> 01:52.662
What just happened?

01:52.662 --> 01:53.672
I don't know!

01:57.682 --> 02:00.492
Dude, the game's still on! Pause it, dude, pause it!

02:00.532 --> 02:01.512
It's paused!

02:01.512 --> 02:04.382
Aww Man! Come on! Come on!

02:04.672 --> 02:06.772
- Rigby, you finish him off! - What?

02:06.802 --> 02:08.332
Dude, we figured out his weakness,

02:08.352 --> 02:10.301
I'll keep the TV going while you beat The Hammer.

02:10.301 --> 02:12.252
Alright, let's do it!

02:12.252 --> 02:13.442
Ready... Go!

02:16.372 --> 02:18.072
I can't do it....

02:18.422 --> 02:20.112
Awww man!

02:20.132 --> 02:21.712
We were totally gonna beat it!

02:22.482 --> 02:23.162
I know...

02:23.202 --> 02:24.882
he's just too hard to beat alone....

02:25.872 --> 02:28.122
Dude, we gotta find another TV.

02:29.452 --> 02:32.372
The Hammer? Nobody gets to The Hammer,

02:32.462 --> 02:34.602
but even if you did, I don't have a TV.

02:35.512 --> 02:37.722
What's wrong with the TV in the house?

02:37.722 --> 02:39.382
I don't know it's broken!

02:39.382 --> 02:40.952
Yeah the screen doesn't work!

02:40.952 --> 02:42.882
Yeah, come on Skips,

02:42.902 --> 02:45.432
Come on Skips, you gotta have some mystical solution or some weird thing

02:45.432 --> 02:47.572
we could use for how we could get another TV.

02:48.622 --> 02:50.082
Did you ask Pops?

02:50.082 --> 02:52.322
The Hammer,

02:52.352 --> 02:56.202
how exciting, is he a mallet or a gavel?

02:57.172 --> 02:59.582
Pops seriously, can we borrow your TV?

02:59.582 --> 03:01.792
- Of course! - Yes!

03:01.792 --> 03:03.652
Here she is!

03:06.162 --> 03:08.222
Pops... that's a radio...

03:08.312 --> 03:11.062
It's a TV if you close your eyes.

03:12.352 --> 03:16.242
Now hook up your game so you can defeat The Hammer.

03:17.552 --> 03:18.912
We don't have time for this...

03:18.912 --> 03:22.252
Rock, Paper, Scissors for who has to ask Muscle Man for his TV?

03:24.402 --> 03:26.992
Come on Rigby, let's go get a real TV!

03:27.212 --> 03:30.352
Wait! I want to see The Hammer too!

03:32.692 --> 03:35.122
- Who is it? - It's us!

03:35.122 --> 03:36.292
What do you want?

03:36.292 --> 03:38.232
We wanna borrow your TV!

03:38.362 --> 03:39.162
Why?

03:39.262 --> 03:40.322
Because...

03:40.442 --> 03:42.222
we're about to beat The Hammer.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.292
WHAT? NOBODY can't beat The Hammer!

03:45.342 --> 03:47.132
It's impossible!

03:47.132 --> 03:48.772
Not for us!

03:48.802 --> 03:50.342
Not for us!

03:50.342 --> 03:52.292
Yeah, you can borrow it...

03:52.292 --> 03:55.872
if you can tell me what The Hammer looks like?

03:55.982 --> 03:58.682
He's blue! With a black mullet!

03:58.682 --> 03:59.542
Fives!

04:04.062 --> 04:05.372
Oh man!

04:05.452 --> 04:06.592
So can we borrow it?

04:06.592 --> 04:08.122
Yeah you can borrow it,

04:08.222 --> 04:10.692
so we can watch you lose!

04:14.182 --> 04:16.291
This is gonna be hi-uhh...

04:20.492 --> 04:22.022
Does Benson have a TV?

04:25.272 --> 04:26.492
Tell him we need it!

04:26.952 --> 04:30.192
Yeah, tell him we need it to see you lose!

04:30.192 --> 04:30.842
Shut up!

04:34.212 --> 04:35.172
Hey Benson...

04:35.172 --> 04:36.322
Tell him we need it!

04:36.712 --> 04:37.542
What is it?

04:38.162 --> 04:39.952
Well... we were just in the neighbourhood-

04:39.952 --> 04:41.522
Cut to the chase, I am busy!

04:41.582 --> 04:42.882
Can we borrow your TV?

04:42.882 --> 04:44.122
No!

04:44.222 --> 04:46.052
No wait!

04:46.052 --> 04:47.272
Benson please!

04:47.302 --> 04:48.682
We're about to beat The Hammer,

04:48.692 --> 04:50.192
we need it!

04:50.352 --> 04:51.962
Yeah....The Hammer?

04:52.042 --> 04:54.062
When you say that I think 'Hammer and Nails'

04:54.072 --> 04:56.602
but you couldn't possibly be talking about work?

04:56.632 --> 04:57.802
It's a video game!

04:57.802 --> 05:01.182
Oh right, right, it's a video game!

05:01.182 --> 05:02.502
Yeah, it's a video game.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.502
Yeah... so can we borrow your TV?

05:04.502 --> 05:05.152
No!

05:05.152 --> 05:06.682
Aw, come on, please....

05:09.972 --> 05:13.602
Look! There's TVs on Benson's TV!

05:15.262 --> 05:17.292
TV Store Warehouse!

05:17.292 --> 05:20.332
We've got TVs! Too many TVs!

05:20.332 --> 05:22.942
Take your pick! We're practically giving them away!

05:22.942 --> 05:25.752
No, wait! We're literally giving them away!

05:25.782 --> 05:28.342
We're literally giving them away!

05:28.342 --> 05:29.532
LITERALLY!

05:29.532 --> 05:31.852
And the other TVs are really cheap!

05:31.852 --> 05:35.442
Yes! So those ones we're practically literally giving away for free too!

05:35.442 --> 05:36.612
Literally!

05:36.622 --> 05:38.762
缺缺缺

05:38.782 --> 05:41.172
'Cause we're just throwing them away!

05:41.192 --> 05:44.972
Yeah! TVs are trash to us, and so are you...

05:45.032 --> 05:48.062
At the TV Store Warehouse!

05:48.322 --> 05:50.482
Does anybody know how far that place is from here?

05:50.532 --> 05:53.332
Not far... I got a buddy who works there.

05:53.372 --> 05:54.272
Let's do it!

05:58.212 --> 06:01.072
We want one of those flat screens from the commercial!

06:01.072 --> 06:02.732
The flatscreens are full-price.

06:02.732 --> 06:06.132
What? But your commercial just said you were giving away free TVs!

06:06.132 --> 06:08.812
Come on, Jimmy, you gotta have something!

06:08.812 --> 06:11.552
Sorry dude... there's nothing I can do Muscle Man...

06:11.552 --> 06:14.402
Jimmy... come on, Jimmy...

06:14.402 --> 06:17.532
you know you owe me and besides, this is worth it!

06:17.532 --> 06:20.102
These guys made it all the way to The Hammer,

06:20.102 --> 06:21.962
AND I WANNA SEE THEM LOSE!

06:21.962 --> 06:23.912
Whoa, are you serious?

06:24.842 --> 06:28.202
Ok, look, I might have something, but don't tell anyone!

06:29.092 --> 06:31.182
What is that?

06:31.182 --> 06:32.332
It's a TV.

06:32.332 --> 06:34.702
- Does it even turn on? - Yeah...

06:36.312 --> 06:39.522
Argh what? It's not even in colour... Lame!

06:41.982 --> 06:46.042
Look, you guys wanted a free TV! This is your free TV!

06:46.832 --> 06:48.962
How much for your cheapest flatscreen?

06:48.962 --> 06:50.222
$1,200.

06:53.432 --> 06:55.212
Make sure the game's still paused!

06:57.342 --> 06:59.492
You really did get to The Hammer!

06:59.492 --> 07:01.802
Yeah... that's what we've been saying the whole time!

07:01.802 --> 07:03.292
I thought you were lying!

07:03.292 --> 07:04.872
Why would we do that?

07:04.872 --> 07:08.032
Cause you're not good enough at anything to get to The Hammer!

07:08.032 --> 07:09.992
This is just a fluke!

07:09.992 --> 07:11.162
You're the fluke!

07:12.482 --> 07:15.132
Guys stop, stop! We've got a problem!

07:15.132 --> 07:16.952
This thing doesn't have the right hook-ups!

07:16.952 --> 07:17.732
What?

07:17.732 --> 07:19.292
Well what does it have?

07:19.302 --> 07:21.372
I don't know it's like a weird... thing...

07:21.372 --> 07:22.902
but it doesn't match this other thing...

07:22.902 --> 07:25.932
plus it doesn't even plug in I mean look at this!

07:25.932 --> 07:27.572
What kind of plug is that?

07:27.572 --> 07:29.002
Forget this man,

07:29.002 --> 07:31.672
you guys aren't even gonna beat The Hammer anyway,

07:31.702 --> 07:33.022
just turn it off!

07:33.512 --> 07:34.292
No!

07:34.372 --> 07:37.212
We can't just give up! I wanna beat this thing.

07:37.212 --> 07:39.442
We may never get this far in the game again.

07:39.652 --> 07:42.182
Now come on, will you please just help us...

07:42.332 --> 07:44.112
please help us...

07:44.842 --> 07:46.702
Let us try... bro!

08:03.672 --> 08:05.422
Keep your fingers crossed.

08:10.092 --> 08:11.642
- Ready? - Ready.

08:34.082 --> 08:36.462
It's The Hammer! He's real!

08:37.642 --> 08:39.032
Dudes, take my picture with-

08:40.881 --> 08:42.792
Oh no, bro.

08:49.172 --> 08:50.312
Skips!

09:08.332 --> 09:09.532
That doesn't look good

09:09.532 --> 09:11.532
What's he doing?

09:11.532 --> 09:12.782
Everybody get down!

09:13.842 --> 09:14.982
Yo, Muscle Man,

09:14.982 --> 09:18.612
my boss found out that I gave you guys that TV and he fired me!

09:18.612 --> 09:21.072
Is it cool if I crash here for a couple day-- what the?

09:25.922 --> 09:28.072
How are we supposed to hurt him?

09:28.072 --> 09:28.912
I don't know!

09:28.912 --> 09:31.672
He was invincible in the game too until we hit him with...

09:31.942 --> 09:32.792
furniture!

09:32.802 --> 09:33.902
Everybody quick!

09:33.912 --> 09:35.862
Grab whatever you can and smash it on him!

09:52.122 --> 09:53.502
Dude, he's almost dead!

09:53.502 --> 09:55.302
Quick, find something else!

09:58.382 --> 09:59.992
There's no more furniture!

10:03.252 --> 10:05.692
Skips, his legs! Watch out for his legs!

10:08.732 --> 10:10.042
Skips, catch!

10:14.682 --> 10:17.752
The control pads! Grab the control pads!

10:27.262 --> 10:29.262
- The game! - Play it!

10:42.022 --> 10:44.542
Yeah we did it!

10:45.802 --> 10:49.102
Hey guys, there was a blackout at my place, so I figured that-
