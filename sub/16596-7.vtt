00:08.009 --> 00:10.509
Hey, everyone!
I'm your host, Vince Vitale,

00:10.511 --> 00:14.013
and welcome
to Chips and Chuckles!

00:15.783 --> 00:18.017
It's an honor to perform
here at Quesadilla Joe's,

00:18.019 --> 00:21.153
where Chris Rock got his start.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.223
(imitates Chris Rock)
Actually, I got my start
in New York City.

00:25.393 --> 00:29.561
But I love comedy night
at Quesadilla Joe's,

00:29.563 --> 00:33.465
where you come for the chips,
but you stay for the chuckles.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.733
(laughter)

00:34.735 --> 00:37.302
Maddie, that's
our old pal Vince.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.905
Vince was the helpful
airline ticket agent we met

00:39.907 --> 00:42.574
when Maddie tried
to chase Diggie to Australia.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.976
He was no help at all.

00:43.978 --> 00:46.078
No, no, he told me
where the bathroom was.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.414
That was super helpful.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.249
(in normal voice)
Tonight's vegan enchilada night

00:50.251 --> 00:51.683
here at Quesadilla Joe's,

00:51.685 --> 00:55.187
which to Vince,
oh, that sounds so good.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.489
But to Morgan Freeman...

00:57.491 --> 00:59.725
(imitates Morgan Freeman)
That sounds like an invitation

00:59.727 --> 01:02.594
to a long night of thunder
Down Under.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.930
-(laughter)
-Good night...

01:04.932 --> 01:06.498
and good luck.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.434
(cheers and applause)

01:09.537 --> 01:10.769
Hey! Vince!

01:10.771 --> 01:12.371
Vince, do you remember us?

01:12.373 --> 01:15.174
Joey! Maddie!
Flight...

01:15.176 --> 01:16.341
241 to Milwaukee.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
-(gasps)
-Vince never forgets a face...

01:18.446 --> 01:19.278
(makes whooshing sound)

01:19.280 --> 01:21.313
or a flight.
(makes whooshing sound)

01:23.084 --> 01:24.750
You were amazing up there.

01:24.752 --> 01:25.884
Thanks.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.053
You were amazing
sitting in that chair.

01:28.055 --> 01:30.422
Thanks.
(chuckles)

01:30.424 --> 01:32.458
It must feel so good
to be in such command
of the audience.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.259
How do you comedians do it?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.462
Well, we take everything
weird about ourselves

01:36.464 --> 01:38.564
and (whooshes)
toss it out there.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.766
For Vince, it's funny voices.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.936
But everybody's got
their own kind of weird.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.904
Oh, hey, Joey,
you have so much weird.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.139
You could totally do that.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.542
Using my weirdness
to work for me

01:50.544 --> 01:53.078
instead of against me? Huh.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.413
I've never really
thought of that.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.348
Hm.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.282
Could my greatest weakness
be my greatest strength?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.153
Am I some kind
of comedy superhero?

02:01.155 --> 02:04.656
(gasps) Oh, is this
my origin story?

02:05.559 --> 02:08.060
Me? (chuckles)
Do stand-up? No.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.496
G-- guys, no.
What would I even say?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.831
Just talk about your life.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.467
-You probably have more
to say than you realize.
-(sighs)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.402
I mean...

02:17.404 --> 02:19.571
the ladies in
Cat Appreciation Club

02:19.573 --> 02:22.674
do find me fascinatin'.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.845
See? You're a complete mess.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.516
You're gonna be great at this.

"Boom or Doom
Chemistry Challenge."

03:32.046 --> 03:34.479
Did you say "challenge," flyer?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.849
Challenge accepted!

03:37.851 --> 03:41.587
Boom or Doom is a two-person
biochem challenge.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.654
The winning team gets

03:42.656 --> 03:45.023
embroidered patches
for its lab coats.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.491
We're scientists.

03:46.493 --> 03:50.796
We take flair on our lab coats
very seriously.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.398
Oh, hey, Val.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.733
What's in the beakers?

03:54.735 --> 03:57.936
One's concentrated fox urine
for enzyme analysis.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.571
The other one's apple juice.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.508
Shoot. I forgot which is which.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.579
Lunch is gonna be exciting!

04:08.749 --> 04:10.849
If Val's my partner
for the Boom or Doom,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.818
there's no way we'll lose.

04:14.121 --> 04:18.890
So this is how it feels
to have intellectual peers!

04:18.892 --> 04:20.525
What do you say?

04:20.527 --> 04:22.294
Me and you?
Friday night?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.097
Seriously?

04:25.099 --> 04:26.565
You and me?

04:26.567 --> 04:29.268
I can't think
of a better pair.

04:29.270 --> 04:30.702
Um, yes.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.371
I'd like that.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.505
See you later.

04:35.075 --> 04:38.443
Well, well, well.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.448
I had no idea

04:43.450 --> 04:47.486
that my brother
was such a playa!

04:49.089 --> 04:50.822
What are you
talking about, Munch?

04:50.824 --> 04:52.658
You just asked Val
to the dance.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.327
Hence the "playa"!

04:55.329 --> 04:56.762
What?

04:56.764 --> 04:59.398
No, I asked her to do
Boom or Doom with me.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.067
No, you said,

05:02.069 --> 05:04.670
"Me and you?
Friday night?"

05:05.839 --> 05:07.472
And then you went like this.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.509
Kapow!

05:12.446 --> 05:13.645
You asked her

05:13.647 --> 05:15.414
to the Boom-Shaboom Dance.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.683
You said you couldn't think
of a better pair.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.685
Parky, that is so romantic.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.320
No!

05:21.322 --> 05:22.654
I meant Boom or Doom,

05:22.656 --> 05:24.122
not Boom-Shaboom!

05:24.124 --> 05:26.024
She knows which Boom
I meant, right?

05:26.026 --> 05:28.260
Why are there
so many Booms?

05:28.262 --> 05:29.961
Well, they're both Friday night,

05:29.963 --> 05:32.130
so you better
tell her that you meant
the chemistry challenge.

05:32.132 --> 05:33.965
Joey, I can't do that.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.701
If she thinks
I asked her to the dance

05:35.703 --> 05:38.303
and I tell her I didn't,
she's gonna be crushed.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.539
Yeah, well...

05:40.541 --> 05:42.674
then ya better
clarify, playa!

05:42.676 --> 05:43.675
Stop!

05:48.515 --> 05:51.616
Hey, Val...

05:51.618 --> 05:52.984
Hey, Parker.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.053
I figured out
which one's apple juice.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.757
I'm not gonna tell you how.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.494
So...

06:02.496 --> 06:04.496
about Friday night...

06:04.498 --> 06:07.532
what-- where do--
what are you gonna wear to...

06:07.534 --> 06:09.301
that thing...

06:10.237 --> 06:12.404
that we're doing...

06:12.406 --> 06:14.706
together...

06:14.708 --> 06:16.908
with us?

06:16.910 --> 06:19.378
The suggested dress code
is on the flyer.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.913
One says "lab coat"
and the other says

06:21.915 --> 06:24.683
"smart, festive,
dressy, casual."

06:24.685 --> 06:26.118
What does that even mean?

06:28.489 --> 06:32.057
You guys will never believe
what just happened.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.125
Tell them, Ruby.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.660
I got all A's on my report card!

06:35.662 --> 06:37.896
-Oh, that's wonderful!
-Fantastic.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.933
I mean, I just personally think
that that deserves

06:41.935 --> 06:44.169
some kind of reward,
right, Aunt Dena?

06:44.171 --> 06:46.271
It sure does.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.672
What would you like, Ruby?

06:47.674 --> 06:51.576
Gosh, I hadn't really
thought about it.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.844
I want to get
my ears pierced.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.746
-Oh.
-Ooh.

06:54.748 --> 06:59.618
Well, it is a perfect time
for physical transformation.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.236
Mars is in retrograde

07:01.237 --> 07:02.853
and the mall is having
a sale on dolphin earrings.

07:04.358 --> 07:07.225
Dena, this is a major
bonding experience.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.428
There's nothing like
watching your little girl

07:09.430 --> 07:12.097
march towards adulthood
by watching a complete stranger

07:12.099 --> 07:13.765
jam a pin
through her ear. Mm-mm.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.635
Yeah, and you know what,
you really are

07:16.637 --> 07:17.803
in such great hands, Ruby.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.638
I mean, when I was here before
and I was shooting

07:19.640 --> 07:22.441
♪<i> Sing it Loud!</i> ♪

07:22.443 --> 07:24.776
your mom actually took me
to get my ears pierced.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.645
No, no, no, no, Liv.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.613
Actually, I took you
to get your ears pierced

07:28.615 --> 07:30.782
when you were home
in Wisconsin on hiatus.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.153
-Liv?
-Maddie?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.421
-Dena?
-Dinner?

07:36.423 --> 07:37.656
Spill.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.424
Um...

07:39.426 --> 07:41.326
Okay, so...

07:41.328 --> 07:44.663
Mom, you didn't really take me
to get my ears pierced.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.833
You took me.

07:47.835 --> 07:50.402
But that was weeks
before I took Liv.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.103
Yeah, it was.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.673
But I wore a headband
over my ears

07:54.675 --> 07:59.411
until the holes closed and then
you took me again as Liv.

07:59.413 --> 08:01.346
Karen:
Now wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.515
You two pulled
a switch-a-Rooney on me

08:03.517 --> 08:06.251
for one of the pinnacle moments
of a mother's life?

08:06.253 --> 08:07.819
And her daughter's.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.923
Whatever.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.990
I just, I--
I couldn't wait, Mom,

08:11.992 --> 08:13.658
so I convinced
Aunt Dena to take me.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.860
(gasps)

08:14.862 --> 08:16.495
I'm weak, Karen.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.700
Don't let this tip your scale
into anger and darkness.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.802
Oh, I will show you
anger and darkness.

08:23.804 --> 08:26.705
In high school, Mom took me
to see Duran Duran without you.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.973
(gasps)

08:27.975 --> 08:29.674
Duran Duran was my band!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.543
Not that night they weren't.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.078
Oh!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.883
What's Duran Duran?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.852
Oh, um, it's sort of
like One Direction
but for old ladies.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.543
Hey, Joe.

08:47.544 --> 08:49.561
-Ready for your big
stand-up debut?
-Oh, you know it.

08:49.563 --> 08:50.896
I've been writin' material.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.465
Maddie, I'm startin' to think
that this is my thang.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.200
(chuckles)
Yeah, that's right.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.402
Joey Rooney got a thang.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.739
Here to introduce
our next act,

09:00.741 --> 09:02.541
Matthew McConaughey,
George W. Bush,

09:02.543 --> 09:06.077
Charles Barkley,
and Adam Sandler.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.080
(imitates Matthew McConaughey)
I believe it's gonna be

09:09.082 --> 09:11.917
all right, all right, all right.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.719
(imitates George W. Bush)
Looking forward to some
sweet jokification.

09:16.990 --> 09:20.325
(imitates Charles Barkley)
I just hope this knucklehead
isn't terrible.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.894
(imitates Adam Sandler)
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome

09:22.896 --> 09:25.730
Mr. Joey Rooney!
(mumbles)

09:25.732 --> 09:26.965
(cheers and applause)

09:29.269 --> 09:30.435
Joey!

09:35.075 --> 09:38.076
Um... so...

09:39.279 --> 09:41.947
Um... hi.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.686
My heart was beating so loud,

09:47.688 --> 09:50.855
I could barely hear the vomit
coming up in my throat.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.425
Uh...

09:54.294 --> 09:55.927
I... I can't do this.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.935
I'm finding my peace...

10:03.937 --> 10:06.705
finding my center.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.076
It's not working!

10:11.078 --> 10:14.379
My conflict with Karen has
ravaged my inner tranquility.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.850
Do you know
what would cheer you up?

10:19.820 --> 10:23.722
Taking me to the mall
to get my ears pierced.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.626
Ruby, I don't feel
comfortable doing that

10:27.628 --> 10:30.895
until I have healed things
with my sister.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.498
Putting a hole in your ear
won't fix the hole in her heart.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.001
(gasps)
Wait.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.636
I think I know a way
to make things better.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.938
A little something
I like to call

10:39.940 --> 10:41.272
"the empty gesture."

10:41.274 --> 10:44.075
That sounds underhanded.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.343
Go on.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.079
Okay, so Aunt Dena,

10:48.081 --> 10:50.949
you tell my mom
that she can take Ruby
to get her ears pierced.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.018
My mom will appreciate
the gesture,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.253
but she knows what a big
bonding experience this is

10:55.255 --> 10:57.455
for a mother and a daughter,
she'll insist that you take her.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.325
Boom! Hearts healed,
ears pierced.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.962
Hi, girls.
Oh, you're here.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.698
Thought you'd be out with Liv
picking out her wedding dress.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.337
-Karen?
-Hm?

11:12.339 --> 11:15.974
I'm going to make an appointment
to take Ruby to get her ears
pierced tomorrow,

11:15.976 --> 11:18.243
but I think
you should take her.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.847
It's only fair.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.317
Well, that is
a very generous gesture.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.988
Oh, please. I know
an empty gesture
when I see it.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.824
I would love to take Ruby.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.926
Oh, thanks, Dena.
You're a peach.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.374
Joey?

11:49.376 --> 11:50.542
What are you doin'?

11:50.544 --> 11:52.977
I'm jumping my sadness away.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.315
Why don't you come out here
and talk to me?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.655
Hey.

12:03.657 --> 12:04.989
So what happened?

12:04.991 --> 12:06.324
(sighs)

12:09.429 --> 12:11.096
Maddie, I choked.

12:11.098 --> 12:14.232
I had no idea
it would be that hard.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.067
I mean, all those people
looking at me.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.270
I mean, I just kept thinking,
"What if they don't think
I'm funny?"

12:19.272 --> 12:21.773
But, Joey, you're
a really funny guy.

12:21.775 --> 12:24.175
Yeah, maybe when
I'm clowning around,

12:24.177 --> 12:26.411
but stand-up is so different.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.981
I mean, I gotta really put
myself out there.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.852
-(sighs)
-It sounds to me
like you're kind of scared.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.321
Yeah, well,
I didn't vomit in my mouth
because I was confident.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.193
All right, well, um...

12:42.195 --> 12:43.228
maybe I can help.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.096
What's the thing
that scares you the most

12:45.098 --> 12:47.065
about being up
on that stage?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.033
Um...

12:49.035 --> 12:51.903
I guess that people
will boo and throw stuff at me

12:51.905 --> 12:53.471
while I'm feeling
naked and vulnerable.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.278
Well done.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.947
I am definitely feeling
naked and vulnerable.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.317
Well, good, 'cause it is, uh,
time that you face your fears.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.452
So...

13:07.454 --> 13:09.320
tell me a joke, funny boy.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.123
Okay. Um...

13:13.827 --> 13:14.893
Knock-knock--

13:14.895 --> 13:16.795
-Boo!
-What are you--

13:16.797 --> 13:18.163
No!

13:18.165 --> 13:20.131
You're supposed to say,
"Who's there?"

13:20.133 --> 13:21.432
You stink!

13:21.434 --> 13:23.067
Ow!

13:23.069 --> 13:24.969
No! Why can't you throw
like a girl?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.071
Like a what?

13:27.073 --> 13:28.273
Sorry! I'm sorry--

13:28.275 --> 13:29.641
I'm sorry!

13:29.643 --> 13:31.409
Maddie, I'm sorry!

13:33.113 --> 13:36.581
Liv, I've got a story idea
for an episode of...

13:36.583 --> 13:37.749
you know.

13:37.751 --> 13:42.353
♪<i> Sing it Louder!</i> ♪

13:42.355 --> 13:44.989
-Uh... yeah.
-Yeah.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.858
-Sure, that's the one. Okay.
-Yeah.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.494
So this really cool guy
asks Sasha to do

13:49.496 --> 13:52.096
a chemistry challenge with him
by gesturing to a flyer,

13:52.098 --> 13:54.933
but the flyer is right next to
a banner for the school dance,

13:54.935 --> 13:57.101
and he's not sure
if she said yes

13:57.103 --> 13:59.637
to the challenge
or to the dance.

13:59.639 --> 14:03.842
So, what do you think
the cool guy should do?

14:03.844 --> 14:06.077
I need to know ASAP.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.980
Hmm...

14:08.982 --> 14:10.281
Wait a second.

14:11.484 --> 14:14.052
You just said "I"
as in you!

14:14.054 --> 14:16.354
This isn't a story idea,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.623
you're coming to me
for girl advice!

14:18.625 --> 14:20.959
I'm gonna go make
a pot of tea

14:20.961 --> 14:22.360
and I'm gonna get
my pan flute CD.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.196
Come on.
Liv, don't be Mom.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.066
I guess I do kind of sound
like Mom. (chuckles)

14:28.068 --> 14:30.735
I totally get her now!

14:30.737 --> 14:33.137
She just wants to be
in our lives!

14:33.139 --> 14:34.372
Liv talked about me?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.074
What did she say?
Tell me anything!

14:36.076 --> 14:38.142
I just want to be
in her life! (chuckles)

14:38.144 --> 14:40.044
What if she wants
to go to the dance?

14:40.046 --> 14:41.246
I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.015
Okay, okay, uh, okay,
so you do not want to go

14:44.017 --> 14:45.216
to the dance
with this girl, right?

14:47.187 --> 14:48.219
Right.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.821
Why did you just pause
before you said that?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.558
I-- I didn't pause.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.792
You totally paused.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.329
Wait a second.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.665
Did you ask this girl

15:00.667 --> 15:02.100
to the science thing,

15:02.102 --> 15:03.969
and now you've thought about it,

15:03.970 --> 15:05.837
and now you want
to take her to the dance?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.740
-No?
-That was another pause!

15:08.742 --> 15:10.708
It was a confusing question.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.243
Admit it.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.347
Okay, fine.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.715
I didn't realize it at first,

15:17.717 --> 15:19.517
but yes, I want to take
her to the dance.

15:19.519 --> 15:22.287
(squeals) Okay, then
you have to let her know,
you gotta put on a suit,

15:22.289 --> 15:27.392
you gotta show up, and you gotta
hope that that's the way
that she feels too.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.694
You know what?
You're right.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.129
-Go big or go home.
-Yes!

15:31.131 --> 15:34.766
(squeals)

15:36.870 --> 15:38.603
This is very exciting.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.306
Please don't do the whoo.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.941
I'm sorry,
it's mandatory.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.109
Whoo!

15:45.111 --> 15:47.178
♪ Parker's got a girlfriend ♪

15:50.750 --> 15:52.984
Are you sure that
you want to go through
with this, Mom?

15:52.986 --> 15:55.453
I mean, wouldn't it be better
to invite Aunt Dena

15:55.455 --> 15:57.322
to go with you to get
Ruby's ears pierced?

15:57.324 --> 15:58.589
No, it wouldn't, Maddie.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.891
I'm Liv.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.326
Are you?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.894
Are you?

16:04.965 --> 16:06.798
Come on, Ruby.
Let's go.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.967
You know what,
Aunt Karen?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.236
I don't want to get
my ears pierced anymore.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.440
It's gonna hurt
you and my mom,

16:15.442 --> 16:17.575
and that'll make me feel bad.

16:18.778 --> 16:23.581
Sweetie, I was trying to make
your mom feel bad, not you.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.784
Oh... Dena!

16:26.786 --> 16:28.319
Yes?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.356
Did you get my silent messages
through the spirit transom?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.360
Take Ruby to get
her ears pierced.

16:35.362 --> 16:39.297
This is something
that a mother and daughter
should experience together.

16:39.299 --> 16:40.331
I'm sorry.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.333
No, I'm sorry.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.303
Oh, would you join us?

16:45.305 --> 16:47.505
Well, I would be honored.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.639
Oh!

16:48.641 --> 16:50.141
Both:
Sis!

16:50.143 --> 16:52.410
Sisters healed,
hearts mended. Let's go.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.315
(sighs)

16:57.317 --> 16:59.250
Hold it, Straight A's.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.487
Did you just bluff my mother?

17:02.489 --> 17:05.690
Hey, if I'm old enough
to get my ears pierced,

17:05.692 --> 17:07.792
I'm old enough
to manipulate grown-ups.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.734
Hey.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.004
If Val shows up
in a lab coat,

17:20.006 --> 17:21.739
I'm gonna look
like a doofus.

17:21.741 --> 17:27.278
But at least I'll be
one fine-looking doofus.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.488
Hey, Val.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.193
Look at you...

17:42.195 --> 17:45.229
dressed for
the biochem challenge.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.266
Ouch.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.500
Oh no.

17:49.502 --> 17:52.937
(laughs)

17:54.407 --> 17:55.740
So...

17:55.742 --> 17:57.742
um...

17:59.345 --> 18:01.479
that's a really nice lab coat.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.382
Thanks.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.250
Nice suit.

18:09.022 --> 18:12.256
Did you think you asked me
to the dance?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.463
Yeah.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.898
I was... kind of hoping.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.234
Actually...

18:23.236 --> 18:26.337
I was kind of hoping too.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.141
What do you think?

18:30.143 --> 18:32.643
I don't usually do
smart, festive, dressy, casual.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.015
You couldn't look more perfect.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.718
(squeals)

18:40.720 --> 18:42.320
Whoo!

18:42.322 --> 18:44.455
Playa!

18:44.457 --> 18:46.624
Everybody just cork it!

18:48.761 --> 18:50.428
Shall we Shaboom?

18:50.430 --> 18:52.497
We shall.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.737
Glad you came back, buddy.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.806
Look, everyone bombs
their first time.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.008
Just remember, if a joke
doesn't go well,

19:04.010 --> 19:05.476
hit 'em with
your Morgan Freeman voice.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.112
No, Vince, I don't have
a Morgan Freeman voice.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.481
(imitates Morgan Freeman)
Well, you best get one, sonny.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.283
(laughs)

19:12.285 --> 19:14.519
Because Morgan Freeman
will save you...

19:14.521 --> 19:15.920
every time.

19:15.922 --> 19:18.322
(laughs)

19:19.325 --> 19:21.492
(imitates Morgan Freeman)
Maddie, I'm nervous--

19:21.494 --> 19:23.261
(in normal voice)
Maddie, I'm nervous.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.930
You know what?
You got this, bro.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.967
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joey Rooney!

19:29.969 --> 19:32.170
(cheers and applause)

19:32.172 --> 19:33.371
Joey!

19:37.443 --> 19:38.543
(exhales)

19:38.545 --> 19:40.778
So, um...

19:40.780 --> 19:44.215
so I-- I peaked physically...

19:44.217 --> 19:45.983
very early,

19:45.985 --> 19:47.618
like ridiculously early,

19:47.620 --> 19:49.654
like when I was two.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.155
(laughter)

19:51.157 --> 19:53.157
-I, uh...
-(laughter continues)

19:53.159 --> 19:55.126
Like seriously.
Like, when I was two,

19:55.128 --> 19:57.495
I got these glasses, right?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.896
And I've had these lips
since I was born.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.032
I looked like
a cartoon character, guys.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.234
-(laughter)
-I was adorable,

20:03.236 --> 20:04.835
the epitome of cute.

20:04.837 --> 20:09.207
And then from about
three years old to now,

20:09.209 --> 20:13.077
I've kind of coasted
at middle-aged female librarian.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.580
-(laughter)
-Which is fine. It's fine.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.148
I just have, like,
this kind of face.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.517
You know, like,
I have the glasses.
Like, I'm stereotyped a lot.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.252
I was in my counselor's office

20:21.254 --> 20:22.520
and we were
setting up my schedule

20:22.522 --> 20:24.822
and, um...
and I was like,

20:24.824 --> 20:26.557
"I'd like to be
in Advanced Robotics,"

20:26.559 --> 20:29.594
and she goes,
"Mm, actually, I wouldn't
recommend Advanced Robotics

20:29.596 --> 20:33.197
'cause the schedule conflicts
with the marching band."

20:33.199 --> 20:35.032
And I was like...

20:35.034 --> 20:37.602
"I'm in the marching band?"

20:38.671 --> 20:40.404
And my counselor was like,

20:40.406 --> 20:44.575
"(scoffs) You're not
in the marching band?"

20:44.577 --> 20:46.544
(laughter)

20:46.546 --> 20:49.614
I moved to LA,
uh, about four months ago.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.515
I've lived here
for like four months.
It's different.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.451
Like, I'm from Wisconsin.
Back in Wisconsin,

20:53.453 --> 20:54.552
I'm a senior in high school.

20:54.554 --> 20:55.920
I'm a senior
in high school here.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.022
I was really looking
forward to being like--
It's how it works.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.523
You know, I get downgraded.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.691
Now I'm in seventh grade now.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.629
But in California,
like, I-- I wanted--

21:04.631 --> 21:07.265
I was looking forward
to being, like, the senior
and getting the, like,

21:07.267 --> 21:08.899
Most Likely to Succeed

21:08.901 --> 21:11.535
or whatever, like,
in the back of the yearbook,

21:11.537 --> 21:14.805
and then I moved to California
and they are much different
than they were in Wisconsin.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.942
I get to California
and it's like Best Vibes.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.610
(laughter)

21:19.612 --> 21:23.014
And like Most Likely
to Stick to a Juice Cleanse.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.484
When I first got here,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.252
I saw a lot of girls
walking around school

21:28.254 --> 21:30.254
with like
"I Heart Nerds" shirts.

21:30.256 --> 21:32.323
or like
"I'm Gonna Marry a Nerd."

21:32.325 --> 21:35.426
And I was like,
"I have come to my paradise.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.495
"This is it.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.330
LA is where I belong!"

21:39.332 --> 21:43.634
And then I found out these girls
don't actually like nerds.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.137
These girls like hot,
muscular guys

21:46.139 --> 21:48.306
that sometimes wear glasses.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.841
(laughter)

21:50.843 --> 21:52.476
And that is not the same.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.011
Guys, not the same.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.180
I, uh...

21:56.182 --> 21:58.482
I'm turning 18 soon.
It's exciting.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.918
A lot of new things
become available to me
when I turn 18.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.820
Like, I can buy
a lottery ticket,

22:02.822 --> 22:05.656
like, I can go
to real person prison,

22:05.658 --> 22:07.091
(laughter)

22:07.093 --> 22:09.460
That's exciting.
The stakes are high.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.594
(laughter)

22:10.596 --> 22:12.296
I can get a tattoo.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.631
Yeah, I can get a tattoo.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.499
A friend of mine
just got a tattoo

22:15.501 --> 22:17.535
and got, um,
"To the moon and back"

22:17.537 --> 22:19.470
in his mom's handwriting
'cause that's something

22:19.472 --> 22:20.771
his mom said
to him a lot.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.840
And then in
his dad's handwriting,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.642
he got "Carpe diem."

22:24.644 --> 22:26.210
And I was like,
"I love that idea.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.445
I can do the same thing."

22:27.447 --> 22:29.146
In my mom's handwriting,
I could get

22:29.148 --> 22:31.882
"I love you like fire"
'cause that's something
my mom says to me a lot,

22:31.884 --> 22:34.018
and then in my dad's handwriting
I could get

22:34.020 --> 22:36.153
"Why can't you be
more like your sisters?"

22:36.155 --> 22:37.221
(laughter)

22:37.223 --> 22:38.689
Thank you guys so much.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.224
I'm Joey Rooney.
You were awesome.

22:40.226 --> 22:42.526
-Whoo!
-(cheers and applause)

22:42.528 --> 22:44.061
Joey:
Thank you.

22:51.170 --> 22:55.306
Thanks for kind of asking me
to the dance tonight, Parker.

22:55.308 --> 22:58.042
Thanks for kind of saying yes.

22:58.044 --> 23:01.312
By the way, you're not
a bad dancer for a scientist.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.347
Thanks. You know,
I was gonna invent

23:03.349 --> 23:07.151
a robot that dances for me,
but that just seemed rude.

23:11.591 --> 23:15.593
So is there anything else
that you want to do tonight?

23:16.729 --> 23:19.263
There is something.

23:20.233 --> 23:23.267
We go in that
Boom or Doom
Chemistry Challenge?

23:23.269 --> 23:25.603
Challenge accepted!

23:27.240 --> 23:29.807
Oh, now I get
why you say that!

23:31.744 --> 23:34.111
Vince:
<i>(imitates Morgan Freeman)</i>
<i>You best get one, sonny.</i>
