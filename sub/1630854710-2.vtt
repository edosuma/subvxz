00:01.040 --> 00:04.920
In the world today, protecting
a country's borders is vital.

00:04.960 --> 00:06.720
(Siren sounds)

00:06.760 --> 00:08.920
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.560
These are the men
and women in uniform

00:11.600 --> 00:14.440
responsible for safeguarding
Ireland's borders.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.640
Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.920
Look at me. Behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.960 --> 00:19.576
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.496
Will you just listen to me?
Will you just listen to me?

00:21.520 --> 00:25.200
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.240 --> 00:28.440
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:28.480 --> 00:29.720
Saving lives...

00:29.760 --> 00:32.800
I'd say about 200km per
hour. ..And protecting Ireland's

00:32.840 --> 00:36.040
inhabitants and millions
of visiting tourists.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.256
You could have been here
100 times, it doesn't mean that

00:38.280 --> 00:40.600
you're guaranteed to
get in the 101st time.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.360
They police the ports...

00:43.400 --> 00:44.816
Well, you have to
make sure there's

00:44.840 --> 00:46.800
definitely nobody
underneath the vehicle.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.160
..The airports... Why
did you tell me you

00:49.200 --> 00:51.160
weren't working?
..And the roads.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.200
These are very
badly damaged straps.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.480
If you can't drive the truck,
shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.000
These are the:

01:04.800 --> 01:08.080
(Siren sounds)

01:09.280 --> 01:12.040
The garda traffic corps
stop a car with UK plates,

01:12.080 --> 01:14.480
and they're not happy
with what they find.

01:14.520 --> 01:15.800
Well, the bad news is,

01:15.840 --> 01:18.840
it hasn't been tested so it's
going to be seized, I'm afraid.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.800
A truck driver at
a rsa checkpoint

01:21.840 --> 01:24.880
faces the prospect
of a prison sentence.

01:24.920 --> 01:28.960
Worst-case scenario, 5,000
Euros and/or six months in jail.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.160
And, at Dublin airport, the
border guards are doubtful about

01:33.200 --> 01:35.360
a passenger's
intentions in Ireland.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.776
I asked you, did your sister
give you a letter of invitation?

01:37.800 --> 01:39.040
Oh... Do you know what I mean?

01:39.080 --> 01:40.800
I didn't know.

01:42.440 --> 01:47.320
Since 1961, cork airport has
grown into a major international hub

01:47.360 --> 01:50.920
flying to over 40
destinations globally.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.000
More than 5,000 passengers
a day pass through,

01:55.040 --> 01:58.240
making it Ireland's second
busiest airport behind Dublin.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.840
Every one of those
5,000 is checked by

02:02.880 --> 02:06.480
Ireland's garda national
immigration bureau.

02:06.520 --> 02:09.080
Hiya. Today, officer James ahern

02:09.120 --> 02:10.840
is Manning the desk.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.600
It's estimated that over
600,000 illegal immigrants

02:14.640 --> 02:16.200
are living in the eu.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.360
Many arrived on student
visas and then just disappeared.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.320
What's the reason
for your visit to Ireland?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.920
This father and son are travelling
over from a non-eu country.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.560
How many weeks?

02:28.600 --> 02:31.120
The son is studying in
Ireland for the summer.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.120
Officer ahern wants
to check out their story.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.840
Do you have a letter from
the school, or some kind of...

02:36.880 --> 02:38.720
It is in my bag.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.240
He claims the
letter is in his bag,

02:42.840 --> 02:45.360
and his bag is beyond
the passport gate.

02:48.280 --> 02:51.200
What we'll do is, I'll
keep the passport.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.960
I'm gonna ask you to go and
get that letter from the school

02:54.000 --> 02:56.160
so I can look at it, ok?
Can I pass through?

02:56.200 --> 02:58.920
Yeah. You can pass through.
I'll keep your passport. Alright?

02:58.960 --> 03:02.400
While the father and son
go in search of their luggage,

03:02.440 --> 03:05.640
officer ahern has another
tricky situation to deal with.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.400
How ya doing?

03:09.160 --> 03:12.600
My passport is in my hand
luggage, and they put it on the hold.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.960
Arriving for a golfing holiday,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.400
this British traveller admits to
not having his passport on him.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.800
The lady said, somebody
would take me down to my bag.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.200
Do you have any more ID on you?

03:24.240 --> 03:26.480
I've only got - no, I haven't.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.520
I've got part - I've got a
photo that has my face on it

03:29.560 --> 03:31.720
'cause I sent it
for the details.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.640
I've got nothing else on me,
only my boarding pass, that's it.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.160
Right.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.440
As member states of the eu,

03:39.480 --> 03:43.760
free travel is allowed
between the UK and Ireland.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.720
Passports are not required, but
UK citizens do need to present

03:47.760 --> 03:49.880
some form of valid photo ID.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.240
Well, because this is
an international airport

03:54.280 --> 03:56.880
and you've come to immigration
without a travel document...

03:56.920 --> 03:58.400
Right. ..I'm gonna have to get

03:58.440 --> 04:00.200
you to sit down
over there, and I'll get

04:00.240 --> 04:02.560
someone to get your bag
and bring it down to you.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.680
Ok. Ok? Alright.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.320
Just take a seat over there.
One of the brown seats over there.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.000
How ya doing? The
father and son were allowed

04:09.040 --> 04:14.120
landside only because they had
passports, but this guy has nothing.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.560
For now, he's staying
airside on international soil.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.400
The father's found his bags,
and he returns letter in hand

04:23.440 --> 04:27.040
to officer ahern to prove
why they're in the country.

04:28.320 --> 04:31.520
Is he leaving on 19 August?
Yes. We have his ticket.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.840
Not the 20th, the 19th?
Yeah. I have his ticket.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.856
Would you like to see it?
Ok. No. If you're telling me

04:36.880 --> 04:39.160
it's the 19th, I'm
happy enough with that.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.960
It all checks out, and their
passports are returned.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.200
Thank you.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.440
They're now officially
allowed into the country.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.560
But the golfer is in trouble.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.760
He needs to find some ID
and, with a queue of passengers

04:53.800 --> 04:57.360
at officer ahern's desk,
he's going nowhere fast.

05:01.400 --> 05:05.120
Every month, nearly 2 million
cars cross the 500km border

05:05.160 --> 05:07.440
between northern
Ireland and the republic.

05:08.720 --> 05:14.400
Many of them stay without being
re-registered, and this is illegal.

05:14.440 --> 05:18.240
Officers paddy mcelroy and
Philip Earl of the garda traffic corps

05:18.280 --> 05:20.440
have found a suspect car.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.360
Its UK plates have rung alarm
bells so they've moved to investigate.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.080
If that isn't taxed, insured,
and so on in the UK,

05:30.120 --> 05:32.640
this vehicle can be seized.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.480
Morning, sir. How are
we? Sorry to disturb you.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.640
Just checking that you've on a
foreign registered vehicle here.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.600
The driver doesn't own the car.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.240
It belongs to his son-in-law,

05:44.280 --> 05:47.840
who has recently moved
from Scotland to Ireland.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.600
Basically, what he's saying
is it's his son-in-law's car.

05:50.640 --> 05:53.560
He's moved over recently
from the UK and he made

05:53.600 --> 05:57.000
arrangements to put it on to Irish
registration plates back in march.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.480
Four months on,
it is a bit much.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.160
Ok. I take it, it's totally
road-legal in the UK, then?

06:02.200 --> 06:05.280
It'd be mot'd and taxed
and insured, and so on?

06:05.320 --> 06:08.400
Ok. I'll just be a moment,
sir. We'll run a quick check.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.240
The driver thinks he can
pull the wool over their eyes in

06:11.280 --> 06:16.200
his UK car, but he clearly doesn't
know about cross-border cooperation,

06:16.240 --> 06:20.120
and it's not long before the
garda get what they need.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.776
Now, sir, that's not
adding up, I'm afraid.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.640
A quick check online is telling
us it hasn't been taxed in over

06:24.680 --> 06:27.760
two years, and it hasn't been
tested in over two years, either.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.000
So it's not
road-legal in the UK.

06:30.040 --> 06:33.240
Alright, sir, I'll just be a
moment to make a few checks.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.160
And, when they decide to
investigate the driver, the plot thickens.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.280
Control? Would you give us a
person check on the road, please?

06:41.320 --> 06:43.040
Go ahead.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.856
So, he's going to come back
with any incidents that he's

06:44.880 --> 06:46.600
been associated with, if any.

06:48.160 --> 06:51.600
Section 41 back in 2010.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.400
Section 41, he's had a car
previously taken off him...

06:55.440 --> 06:59.040
I think we have bad news
for him. Yeah, I think so.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.120
He's got previous, and
their minds are made up.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.920
They're taking him off the road.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.560
Hello, sir. Sorry for the delay.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.560
Now, checked, you've previously
had a car taken off you in 2010, I see.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.880
Well, the bad news
is, I'm not happy that it's

07:12.920 --> 07:16.040
road-legal in Ireland. As I
say, it hasn't been tested in over

07:16.080 --> 07:19.240
two years in the UK, and definitely
hasn't been tested in Ireland.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.920
So, it's going to be seized,
I'm afraid, under operations of

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
section 41 of the
road traffic act.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.056
What I have to do is make a
lawful demand for you to produce

07:26.080 --> 07:27.840
all your documents
within ten days.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.680
So that's your
certificate of exemption

07:29.720 --> 07:33.880
or insurance, and a certificate of
road worthiness, the mot, or nct.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.520
If he fails to do that, he'll end
up in court and being prosecuted.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.480
It is a penalty point
matter, obviously,

07:39.520 --> 07:41.400
driving a car that's untested.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.280
And, if he doesn't have
insurance, he's facing a ban.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.640
The next place this driver is
heading for is the courtroom.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.960
Back at cork airport, and
border guard James ahern

07:57.000 --> 07:59.080
has been approached
by a passenger.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.960
My passport is in my hand
luggage, and they put it on the hold.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.080
The lady said someone
would take me down to my bag,

08:06.120 --> 08:07.960
and I could show it
to you down there.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.320
Do you have any
more ID on you? No.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.520
Alright. Just take a seat
over there. On one of the

08:12.560 --> 08:14.376
brown seats over there. The
passenger is being forced to

08:14.400 --> 08:16.720
play the waiting game
while he tries to work out

08:16.760 --> 08:18.560
how to get his documents.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.840
If he can't provide some form of
photo ID, he could be on the next

08:23.880 --> 08:25.800
flight back to the UK.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.200
He's not travelling alone.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.920
His friend has already
crossed the border. He hopes to

08:32.960 --> 08:37.080
track them down by a text, and
retrieve his passport that way.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.640
This is an
international airport.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.920
You can't come through
immigration without

08:40.960 --> 08:42.520
your passport or
travel document.

08:42.560 --> 08:45.080
The airline and
its handling agents

08:45.120 --> 08:48.240
are under obligation to remind
all passengers, if they take

08:48.280 --> 08:51.520
their bags off, to remove their
travel documents from their bags.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.480
This creates a big problem
for us, and for the passengers.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.160
The text got through.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.520
Yeah. You can pass through.

09:01.560 --> 09:04.760
And his friend finally
appears with his bag.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.400
With his documents to hand,

09:06.440 --> 09:10.120
he is able to return to
the immigration desk.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.160
You understand that because it's
an international airport that we need

09:14.200 --> 09:16.616
to see your travel document before
you can pass through immigration.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.096
Yeah. Yeah. I wasn't expecting
to go through without it.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.080
But I just thought
(inaudible) Yeah. Yeah.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.280
Ok. Very good. Thanks for
that. Ok. Thank you. Bye-bye.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.840
They put my bag on the hold,
and I literally remembered as

09:26.880 --> 09:29.456
the wheels went down. I was
like, "oh, no, I ain't got me passport."

09:29.480 --> 09:32.080
But he was alright, to be fair.
So, that's all sorted, isn't it?

09:32.120 --> 09:34.720
Hopefully, I'll have my
passport when I come back.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.640
It's crazy coming
in to an airport,

09:36.680 --> 09:40.120
international or not,
without a travel document.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.640
It's crazy.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.800
Road safety inspector Jim
Fleming is Manning a checkpoint

09:50.840 --> 09:52.520
outside of Dublin.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.000
They have selected a busy stretch
of road as trucks are required to

09:56.040 --> 09:57.920
deliver goods
across the borders.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.696
I'll just have a quick look at this
download, and I'll be back to you.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.600
The road safety authority
use these checks to ensure

10:03.640 --> 10:07.480
that all vehicle safety
regulations are being followed.

10:07.520 --> 10:11.440
If a driver is found to be operating
outside the limits of the law,

10:11.480 --> 10:15.720
the rsa have the power to
seize the vehicle and impound it.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.000
Inspector Fleming's
next truck is an import.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.920
Companies often
import trucks from the UK,

10:24.960 --> 10:29.160
and re-register them in Ireland,
saving them thousands of pounds.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.416
My name is Jim Fleming. I'm
a transport officer for the rsa.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.760
I've just got to look at
your tacho, and go through

10:33.800 --> 10:35.960
the licencing details with you.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.520
All trucks operating in the eu
are required by law to record on a

10:39.560 --> 10:44.200
tachograph detailed information
about every journey they make.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.240
If they don't comply, they can
face fines in excess of 3,000 Euros,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.800
as well as four
months or more in jail,

10:52.840 --> 10:55.120
and a six-month driving ban.

10:56.880 --> 11:01.160
In 2014, the rsa took nearly
300 prosecutions to court.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.656
I'll just have a quick look at this
download, and I'll be back to you.

11:04.680 --> 11:08.000
The tacho download will allow
him to see if the driver is keeping

11:08.040 --> 11:10.800
to the strict regulations
on driving hours.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.400
So, we'll just have a look at
the download now, and see.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.280
Drivers have a personal
driver's card to use in

11:17.320 --> 11:19.520
the tacho whilst on shift.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.240
I can see there last Tuesday,
the vehicle was driven for a day

11:26.280 --> 11:28.200
with no driver card in it.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.520
There's a problem
with the driver's card.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.840
Jim is now more than suspicious
about the truck's activity.

11:35.880 --> 11:39.440
No card should mean no journey.

11:39.480 --> 11:43.000
The tachograph is not in
compliance with the regulations.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.960
The tachograph has also revealed
to him that the vehicle has the wrong

11:47.000 --> 11:50.640
registration details
and no operator licence.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.320
Things don't look
good for the driver,

11:54.360 --> 11:57.400
and jail time is not
out of the question.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.320
Yeah, well, driving in
the last 28 days is on it.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.240
You should've hung onto it.

12:11.280 --> 12:15.000
With the gravity of the offences
hanging over him, the driver calls

12:15.040 --> 12:19.480
his company manager, and
it's not long before he arrives.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.456
I just need to read this back to
you because you're in it, as well.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.040
Just need to go through
this. What's the fine for that?

12:25.080 --> 12:28.800
Worst-case scenario, 5,000
Euros, and/or six months in jail.

12:30.360 --> 12:33.760
Finally, the full impact
of the situation hits home.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.880
Thank you. Thanks for your time.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.240
With a large fine and
potential jail time on the table,

12:39.280 --> 12:43.640
the company manager will need to
act fast to rectify the infringements.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.160
For now, the men are on
their way with a warning,

12:48.200 --> 12:51.640
but if they don't provide proof that
the problems have been sorted out,

12:51.680 --> 12:54.120
their next stop could be a cell.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.200
In 2017, Dublin was the fastest
growing major European airport

13:01.240 --> 13:05.240
with close to 30 million passengers
passing through from far-flung

13:05.280 --> 13:09.480
destinations like Abu Dhabi,
New York and Hong Kong.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.560
There's a constant
threat of illegal immigrants

13:14.600 --> 13:17.320
trying to get into Ireland.
Sometimes to stay.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.960
Sometimes to
travel on to the UK.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.240
It's vitally important to check
each and every passenger,

13:24.280 --> 13:29.200
a task that falls to the officers
working the immigration desks.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.040
Officers like Mick lhalley.

13:31.080 --> 13:33.000
You sign that, and you go home.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.000
Right. Ok. If he suspects
a passenger doesn't

13:35.040 --> 13:38.760
have enough funds for their
stay, or can't prove they're here

13:38.800 --> 13:41.720
legitimately, then
they're not getting in.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.920
How long are you here
for? Only a break. For three...

13:44.960 --> 13:48.560
Right. She has a -
she invited me here.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.880
A woman has recently
landed from Toronto.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.720
She says she's
here to visit her sister.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.400
If he's going to Grant
her leave to land,

13:57.440 --> 13:59.800
he's going to need
more information.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.400
Right, if you're coming
to stay with your sister -

14:02.440 --> 14:04.960
did your sister give
you a letter of invitation?

14:05.000 --> 14:06.760
Yeah. She invited me here.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.880
Did she give you a letter?

14:08.920 --> 14:11.200
Her English is good, but
she doesn't understand

14:11.240 --> 14:12.720
what officer lhalley wants.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.920
No letter. So how do I
know she's invited you?

14:15.960 --> 14:17.920
I didn't know. She didn't...

14:17.960 --> 14:20.560
"I do not know."
That is the answer.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.320
I asked you, did your sister
give you a letter of invitation?

14:25.360 --> 14:27.576
Do you know what I mean?
I don't know about that letter.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.600
I didn't know.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.040
Without the letter, she has to
convince him that she's genuine

14:33.080 --> 14:35.440
or he could refuse her entry.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.800
It's the night shift for
the garda traffic corps.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.120
Officers Mark Faye
and paddy mcelroy

14:43.160 --> 14:46.520
are patrolling the roads between
Dublin port and Dublin airport.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.840
They have spotted a
car driving erratically.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.680
They head off in pursuit.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.240
And, it's not long before
they've cornered him.

15:08.520 --> 15:09.960
How are we doing?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.416
Ok, the reason why we're stopping
you is your manner of driving, ok?

15:12.440 --> 15:13.440
Yes.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.480
You forgot the indicator.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.896
But it's also the manner of speed
in which you're driving, as well.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.480
Ok, I'm going to
conduct a test with you.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.656
Ok? So, do you want to turn
off the engine of the car, and I'll

15:22.680 --> 15:25.520
show you the test I'm going
to do with you, ok? So, hop out.

15:26.040 --> 15:31.600
In 2017, the garda traffic corps
ran over 50,000 mandatory roadside

15:31.640 --> 15:34.200
checks for drug intoxication.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.520
Driving under the influence of
drugs carries a maximum fine of 5,000

15:39.560 --> 15:44.640
Euros, up to six months in
prison and a 12 month driving ban.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.680
I need you to take this. Roll
it on the inside of your mouth.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.200
When this goes blue,
I'll tell you when to stop.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.400
Ok? It takes a few
minutes so you go ahead.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.480
As much phlegm
as you possibly can.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.840
Let me see it?

16:03.880 --> 16:06.000
Nope. Keep going.

16:06.040 --> 16:09.080
Just driving erratically,
especially at this time of night,

16:09.120 --> 16:11.320
anybody could still be
out walking their dogs.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.040
And it's the summertime.
Kids would be out,

16:14.080 --> 16:17.280
they could still be out at this
time. You just never know.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.960
It isn't acceptable.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.480
The test is taking too long.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.680
They should have
a result by now. No.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.160
Still not? Still
not. Keep going.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.280
Strange. Mmm.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.920
The officer inspects
the test device.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.840
You broke the glass. How?

16:37.880 --> 16:40.400
You chewed on it.

16:40.440 --> 16:43.640
With a broken
mouthpiece, the test is void.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.680
He has no choice
but to start again.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.320
Ok, now, don't chew on it.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.360
Suck on it.

16:51.840 --> 16:54.720
And, again, there's a
problem with the machine.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.560
You've broken it again.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.736
Yeah, I told you to suck
but you're breaking the glass.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.000
You're actually
breaking the piece.

17:05.360 --> 17:08.360
Could it be that this
driver is wise to the test

17:08.400 --> 17:11.240
and is deliberately
breaking the equipment?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.520
If he is, the garda are having
none of it, and it's third time lucky.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.520
The officer slots the sample into
the test machine to get the results.

17:21.560 --> 17:24.360
Now we wait. Alright? Ok.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.880
The garda now have
to play the waiting game

17:27.920 --> 17:30.200
whilst the machine
does its work.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.320
Back at Dublin airport,
officer Mick lhalley is

17:37.360 --> 17:40.720
dealing with a passenger who
has recently landed from Toronto.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.480
Right. If you're coming
to stay with your sister -

17:43.520 --> 17:46.360
did your sister give
you a letter of invitation?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.600
Yeah. She invited me here.

17:48.640 --> 17:53.080
She says she's here to stay with
her sister, but Mick's not convinced.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.360
No letter. So how do I
know she's invited you?

17:57.320 --> 18:00.960
She has no proof of her
reasons for coming to Ireland.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.320
You need a letter
of invitation from her

18:04.360 --> 18:06.960
because if she's
accommodating you,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.200
then you don't have to
show hotel bookings on it.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.400
I've been here in 2012, as
well. I know, but what I'm trying to

18:13.440 --> 18:15.640
explain to you is you could
have been here 100 times,

18:15.680 --> 18:17.256
it doesn't mean that
you're guaranteed to get in

18:17.280 --> 18:18.560
the 101st time.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.480
You can check in my file here.

18:21.520 --> 18:22.560
Don't you guys have files?

18:22.600 --> 18:24.080
How do you know you have a file?

18:24.120 --> 18:25.600
You mightn't have a file.

18:27.880 --> 18:31.440
Well, it's (inaudible) Do
you have a return ticket?

18:31.480 --> 18:34.280
Yeah. Are you going
to show it to me?

18:36.080 --> 18:39.200
Oh, um, they didn't print it
here, but I have a return flight,

18:39.240 --> 18:41.360
August 29,

18:41.400 --> 18:44.760
to Canada, at night time.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.360
Mick has decided how to proceed.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.200
Having verified the woman's return
flight, Mick is convinced enough

19:04.240 --> 19:06.560
to Grant her entry
to the country.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.960
Ok? She's allowed
to be on her way,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.960
and Mick moves
on to the next in line.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.040
On the night
shift... There it is.

19:15.080 --> 19:18.040
Garda traffic officers have
stopped the Hungarian driver who

19:18.080 --> 19:20.480
was driving erratically.

19:20.520 --> 19:23.360
Ok, the reason why I'm stopping
you is your manner of driving, ok?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.920
With activity around the
port busy both day and night...

19:25.960 --> 19:27.976
When this goes blue, I'll
tell you when to stop. Ok?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.160
..It's important that
dangerous drivers are stopped

19:30.200 --> 19:33.360
and, if necessary,
taken off the roads.

19:33.400 --> 19:35.680
You broke the glass.
They suspect he is under

19:35.720 --> 19:37.480
the influence of drugs

19:37.520 --> 19:40.240
and, after a couple
of failed attempts,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.680
have managed to get a
saliva sample from him.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.440
It shows these four things.

19:49.480 --> 19:55.320
So it shows cocaine, opiates,
being heroin, benzos and cannabis.

19:58.320 --> 20:01.160
Well, it all depends. You'll
be brought back to our station.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.896
We'll get a blood - that's
going back all through in

20:02.920 --> 20:06.160
the garda station, and then
it'll be sent off for analysis.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.576
And if it's detected in the blood,
well, then you'll be summoned

20:08.600 --> 20:12.680
to court. And then, it's a
one year disqualification,

20:12.720 --> 20:15.320
after all the convicted
in court. Alright.

20:15.360 --> 20:20.560
They've been waiting patiently,
and now the results are in.

20:20.600 --> 20:22.680
It's bad news for the driver.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.400
You have tested
positive for cocaine.

20:24.440 --> 20:28.120
So far. That's bad. Ok.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.280
Ok. So, I have to inform you
that I'm arresting you on suspicion

20:31.320 --> 20:33.416
of being under the influence
of drugs whilst driving.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.320
You are not obliged
to say anything

20:35.360 --> 20:37.336
unless you wish to do
so, but anything you do say

20:37.360 --> 20:40.200
will be taken down in writing,
and may be given in evidence.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.880
Do you understand
what all this means? Ok.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.400
It's down to the station for a
blood test to confirm the result.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.800
If it comes back positive, this
man is facing losing his licence,

20:53.840 --> 20:56.160
a maximum 5,000 euro fine

20:56.200 --> 20:58.600
and possible jail time.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.160
Do you take much cocaine?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.680
Yeah. See how long it
stays in the system for?

21:07.520 --> 21:11.760
He claims it's been 48
hours since he took the drug,

21:11.800 --> 21:14.200
but that doesn't help.
Cocaine can still be detected

21:14.240 --> 21:16.160
in the system in that time.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.680
What do you work as?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.080
Right. Are you a driver?

21:37.640 --> 21:40.000
So you need your licence?

21:43.560 --> 21:46.040
Now listen. Hopefully,
this is a lesson for you.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.960
The seriousness of
the situation hits home.

21:52.000 --> 21:56.760
He's not only facing losing his
licence but his livelihood, too.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.800
