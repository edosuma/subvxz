00:01.760 --> 00:06.178
<i>Someone! Someone help me!
I'm trapped in a well!</i>

00:06.282 --> 00:08.008
<i>And the waters
are rising!</i>

00:08.111 --> 00:10.596
<i>And I'm still in love
with Zane!</i>

00:12.357 --> 00:14.186
Wait, what?
No, no! It's over?

00:14.290 --> 00:17.189
<i>...so are</i>
The Tides of Our Days.

00:17.293 --> 00:19.226
Ugh, I need to know
how you get out of the well.

00:19.329 --> 00:20.606
Ooh, and when are you
gonna find out

00:20.710 --> 00:21.987
that Zane killed your sister?

00:22.091 --> 00:23.954
I always knew, darling.

00:24.058 --> 00:24.990
I helped him.

00:25.094 --> 00:27.130
You're so bad.

00:27.234 --> 00:30.133
Oh, I love this research
for this obituary.

00:30.237 --> 00:31.721
Usually, I'm just
Googling to make sure

00:31.824 --> 00:33.309
they don't have
a secret second family.

00:33.412 --> 00:34.241
Can I come in?

00:34.344 --> 00:35.966
Hello.
Uh, not really

00:36.070 --> 00:37.589
a fair question
when you're already in.

00:37.692 --> 00:39.487
I want to make sure you remember
to take out the trash

00:39.591 --> 00:40.799
and put your dishes away,

00:40.902 --> 00:42.973
and compost
your pistachio shells,

00:43.077 --> 00:44.768
and please, if you're
gonna steal my toothpaste,

00:44.872 --> 00:47.116
squeeze from the bottom instead
of the middle, like a carny.

00:47.219 --> 00:49.808
The gall. I love him.

00:49.911 --> 00:52.776
Also, I-I need you to
hold onto a few things for me.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.951
Uh, you know, usually, when you
ask someone for a favor,

00:55.055 --> 00:56.987
you don't berate them first.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.024
Fair, but my girlfriend
Charlotte is coming to visit

00:59.128 --> 01:02.096
from San Diego,
and I need to make room for her.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.270
I'm finally gonna
meet Charlotte?

01:03.373 --> 01:05.306
Ooh,
the girlfriend's coming.

01:05.410 --> 01:07.826
Oh, classic complication.

01:07.929 --> 01:10.000
I wonder if she's gonna be
a complete nightmare

01:10.104 --> 01:11.450
or a jealous vixen.

01:11.554 --> 01:13.832
Or a sleepwalking serial killer
that just got out of a coma.

01:13.935 --> 01:15.489
- Season 23!
- Season 23!

01:17.007 --> 01:18.940
- Whoa, another one?
- Yeah.

01:19.044 --> 01:21.322
Listen, this is the first time
she's ever been in my space,

01:21.426 --> 01:23.600
and I just need
everything to be perfect.

01:23.704 --> 01:25.706
Wait, she seriously
has never been here before?

01:25.809 --> 01:28.053
No, I go there every weekend
from Friday at 6:00

01:28.157 --> 01:29.675
till Sunday at 4:00, which is
the perfect amount of time

01:29.779 --> 01:32.161
for hiking, tacos, and sex.

01:32.264 --> 01:33.300
Multiple times.

01:33.403 --> 01:35.129
- Can you please stop?
- Oh, go on.

01:35.233 --> 01:36.303
We're kind of at
a make it or break it point

01:36.406 --> 01:40.030
in our relationship,
and I think if things go well,

01:40.134 --> 01:41.170
she might move in with us.

01:42.378 --> 01:44.207
Okay, have a nice day.

01:44.311 --> 01:45.139
Wait-- uh...

01:46.175 --> 01:47.314
Did he just say
move in with us?

01:47.417 --> 01:50.903
Yes. He just let it
hang in the air,

01:51.007 --> 01:53.734
like he was begging you to come
back after the opening credits.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.193
I just can't imagine
what this girlfriend's like.

02:04.296 --> 02:06.505
I mean, if Edward has
30 rules for you,

02:06.609 --> 02:08.369
imagine how many
he has for her,

02:08.473 --> 02:10.095
Oh, yeah, but what
if she's just like him?

02:10.199 --> 02:11.545
- Mm.
- You know, I-I just--

02:11.648 --> 02:12.442
I can't imagine living
with two Edwards.

02:12.442 --> 02:13.374
That's like living with...

02:13.478 --> 02:14.824
- two Edwards.
- Mm.

02:14.927 --> 02:15.928
I have so many questions.

02:16.032 --> 02:17.827
Like, who uproots
their entire life for a guy

02:17.930 --> 02:19.104
that's she's only known for,
like, a few months.

02:19.208 --> 02:22.383
Mm!
Who would do that?

02:22.487 --> 02:24.903
Phillip? Come on.

02:25.006 --> 02:27.008
No.
That was for love.

02:27.112 --> 02:28.596
This is for Edward.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.184
Mm-hmm.

02:30.288 --> 02:32.738
Hey, Cricket is throwing
a trivia night

02:32.842 --> 02:34.084
at her wine bar...
- Mm.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.191
so you should come, because the
winner gets a free wine tasting.

02:37.295 --> 02:38.123
No, no, you have to take
that down right now,

02:38.227 --> 02:39.538
because if Lexi sees this,

02:39.642 --> 02:40.953
she's gonna want to play...
- Oh.

02:41.057 --> 02:42.714
...and then her competitive
streak will come out.

02:42.817 --> 02:45.751
When we podded together, game
nights were the absolute worst

02:45.855 --> 02:47.374
because she hates
to lose.

02:47.477 --> 02:49.099
I'm right behind you, aren't I?

02:49.203 --> 02:52.965
Hi. Hi. Mm.

02:53.069 --> 02:54.035
We're just sitting here
talking about

02:54.139 --> 02:55.934
break room stuff
with, uh, this one.

02:56.037 --> 02:57.798
- Mm-hmm.
- Like cream cheese.

02:57.901 --> 02:59.938
- Mm.
- It is, like, so thick.

03:00.041 --> 03:01.802
- She's a fiend.
- Do I see a little

03:01.905 --> 03:02.975
trivia night flyer?

03:03.079 --> 03:04.598
Because count me in.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.082
That sounds fun.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.980
Sam,
you want to be teammates?

03:08.084 --> 03:09.361
I call Sam!
Okay, great. You do that.

03:09.465 --> 03:10.983
I'm gonna go somewhere else.

03:11.087 --> 03:12.571
- Oh, Sam.
- No.

03:12.675 --> 03:14.194
- Saaam.
- No.

03:14.297 --> 03:16.886
We said no more
game nights, okay?

03:16.989 --> 03:20.234
Keith and I are still finding
Scrabble tiles in my bushes,

03:20.338 --> 03:23.410
and I'm pretty sure there's
a "V" still clogging our toilet.

03:23.513 --> 03:25.066
That was the pandemic.
We were all on edge.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.103
- This'll be fun.
- What'll be fun?

03:27.207 --> 03:28.380
Trivia night at Cricket's.

03:28.484 --> 03:30.555
Ooh, yeah,
that does sound fun.

03:30.658 --> 03:32.488
Should I be leader?
No, you're right. That's Lexi.

03:32.591 --> 03:34.938
Look, you're always telling me
I need to do more

03:35.042 --> 03:36.388
"regular people" things,

03:36.492 --> 03:38.804
like "not wearing
driving gloves"

03:38.908 --> 03:41.013
or "drinking from a can."

03:41.117 --> 03:42.912
I love you, but I'm sorry.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.845
My therapist said I have
to establish healthy boundaries,

03:44.948 --> 03:47.503
and so the answer is no.

03:47.606 --> 03:49.090
I'm gonna take that
as a maybe, Sam-Sam.

03:50.471 --> 03:52.991
Your obituary is gonna be
as fabulous as you are.

03:53.094 --> 03:54.579
- Oh.
- Three ex-husbands,

03:54.682 --> 03:56.408
ah, one wife,

03:56.512 --> 03:59.239
and you still had time
to tour with the Osmonds?

03:59.342 --> 04:03.208
I'm just so excited to have
my entire story told.

04:03.312 --> 04:04.830
Are you gasping

04:04.934 --> 04:07.281
- at what I'm gasping at?
- The girlfriend is here,

04:07.385 --> 04:09.456
ready for
her dramatic entrance.

04:09.559 --> 04:11.251
Hi.

04:11.354 --> 04:13.183
You must be Nell.
I'm Charlotte.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.495
I'm so excited
to finally meet you.

04:14.599 --> 04:16.877
Yeah, yeah. I'm excited
to finally meet you, too.

04:16.980 --> 04:19.880
She looks sweet,
but who knows

04:19.983 --> 04:21.295
what's going on
under the surface.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.848
Ask her if
that's her real nose.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.954
So, like, just, like, tell me
everything about yourself.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.335
I mean, is there, like,
a specific way

04:26.438 --> 04:27.543
you like to
organize your spices

04:27.646 --> 04:29.303
or how you like
your toothpaste squeezed.

04:29.407 --> 04:31.616
No, I am very average. Yeah.

04:31.719 --> 04:34.722
I-I love the beach
and hiking with Edward and--

04:34.826 --> 04:35.792
oh, I love baking.

04:35.896 --> 04:36.828
I just made these.

04:36.931 --> 04:38.278
Oh.

04:38.381 --> 04:41.246
They're Edward's favorite,
chocolate chip skillet cookies

04:41.350 --> 04:43.697
with a hint of cinnamon
and a sprinkle of doobie.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.906
I got the recipe
from his Aunt Helen.

04:46.009 --> 04:48.840
- Not the doobie part.
- Oh, right. Oh, whoa.

04:50.566 --> 04:52.292
Is... uh...

04:52.395 --> 04:53.672
I-- whew.

04:53.776 --> 04:55.743
I see that you really put
the work in.

04:55.847 --> 04:57.089
I think that maybe we should
clean some of this up

04:57.193 --> 04:59.057
before Edward gets--
Ahh!

04:59.160 --> 05:01.059
Hey, handsome.
- Hey, gorgeous.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.234
Oh, my God.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.546
I know.

05:05.650 --> 05:06.996
Here come the fireworks!

05:07.099 --> 05:08.929
You made my favorite cookies.

05:09.032 --> 05:10.240
What?

05:12.726 --> 05:13.899
Mm.
These are incredible.

05:15.073 --> 05:18.387
Nell,
you gotta try these.

05:18.490 --> 05:21.424
Yeah. That-- That is,
um, pretty incredible.

05:22.667 --> 05:24.565
I'm sorry,
what are those toes?

05:24.669 --> 05:26.395
Charlotte got these
awesome mandals for me.

05:26.498 --> 05:28.293
- But you hate toes.
- I hate your toes.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.744
Eddie, be nice.

05:30.847 --> 05:32.228
You're right, baby.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.126
Nell, I think your toes
are fantastic.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.543
Thank you, Eddie.

05:36.646 --> 05:38.199
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

05:41.513 --> 05:43.860
He's like,
a totally different person.

05:43.964 --> 05:46.967
It's like your roommate's
been taken over by an evil twin.

05:47.070 --> 05:48.555
Let's put that theory
to the test.

05:48.658 --> 05:50.591
Hey, Eddie, I'm gonna grab
one of these cookies,

05:50.695 --> 05:53.145
but, eh, I don't have a napkin,
so crumbs might go everywhere.

05:53.249 --> 05:55.147
Do your thing, girl.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.218
Whoever he is,
I hope he stays.

05:57.322 --> 05:58.910
Cool. Cool, cool.

05:59.013 --> 06:00.394
Nope. I'm dead.

06:03.432 --> 06:04.985
Ah. Oh!

06:05.088 --> 06:07.263
This is awesome.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.782
You know, you never want to
watch <i>Extreme Packrat</i> with me.

06:08.885 --> 06:10.093
Are you kidding?

06:10.197 --> 06:11.819
I love when people
keep their urine in jars.

06:11.923 --> 06:13.890
- Oh.
- Mm, speaking of,

06:13.994 --> 06:16.306
I have to use
the little girl's jar.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.585
Can you pause it for me?

06:18.688 --> 06:21.553
Yeah, I can turn it off.
I can guess how this ends.

06:21.657 --> 06:24.625
She gets her life together and
goes to her daughter's wedding.

06:28.077 --> 06:30.976
Oh.

06:31.080 --> 06:32.081
There he is.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.603
No. Don't you-- No!
Get-- No!

06:36.706 --> 06:38.777
Stop it!
I wanted to eat those crumbs!

06:40.917 --> 06:42.194
I like Charlotte.

06:42.298 --> 06:44.473
She's kind and she's smart
and she's thoughtful.

06:44.576 --> 06:45.991
She's always making
my favorite cookies.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.924
I totally agree.
Charlotte is great.

06:48.028 --> 06:49.409
There are some other
pressing issues.

06:49.512 --> 06:51.272
She's soaking the cast-iron
skillets in the water.

06:51.376 --> 06:52.860
I can hear them
oxidizing from here.

06:52.964 --> 06:55.035
So, why don't you just tell her?
It's not that big a deal.

06:55.138 --> 06:56.623
- You're right.
- Mm.

06:56.726 --> 06:58.107
Will you do it?
Huh?

06:58.210 --> 06:59.626
Just tell her
how to clean the pans,

06:59.729 --> 07:00.834
and to always use coasters,

07:02.076 --> 07:02.767
and to turn off the water
when she's brushing her teeth.

07:02.870 --> 07:03.802
You want me to be the you?

07:04.769 --> 07:06.184
Yes.

07:06.287 --> 07:07.496
Be the me.

07:07.599 --> 07:09.636
I don't want to scare her off
with all my--

07:09.739 --> 07:10.982
I mean, they're totally
reasonable requests...

07:11.085 --> 07:13.018
- Mm.
- ...but I want this to work.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.469
Nell.

07:18.127 --> 07:19.715
Fine. Yeah.

07:19.818 --> 07:20.785
I'll be the you.

07:20.888 --> 07:22.683
But if Charlotte moves in,

07:22.787 --> 07:25.065
I want rent split three ways,
not two.

07:25.168 --> 07:26.411
Fine.

07:26.515 --> 07:29.000
And I get to have as many
ice cubes as I want,

07:29.103 --> 07:31.071
hum in the morning, and paint
my toenails in the living room.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.313
You can paint,
but no pumicing.

07:32.417 --> 07:33.453
I can't pumice
you anything.

07:38.665 --> 07:39.976
Got a minute?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.322
Yeah, sure.
What's up?

07:41.426 --> 07:45.430
I just wanted to circle back
on the whole trivia night thing,

07:45.534 --> 07:48.882
because...
this could be us, The Fun Bunch!

07:48.985 --> 07:50.366
Lexi, I said no.
I have--

07:51.678 --> 07:53.403
Oh, it's actually
very soft.

07:53.507 --> 07:56.510
It's Prada. Look--
But no, no.

07:56.614 --> 07:58.512
I said no and I mean no.

07:58.616 --> 08:00.549
Listen, I thought about it,
and you're right.

08:00.652 --> 08:02.378
Games bring out
the worst in me.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.450
- Yeah, I know that.
- But you don't know why.

08:05.554 --> 08:09.178
When I was a child, my parents
made everything a contest.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.352
Literally. One time,
they used a game of Monopoly

08:11.456 --> 08:12.595
to determine
which of their children

08:12.699 --> 08:14.390
would be sent
to a boarding school.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.081
It was a hotel
on Baltic Avenue

08:16.185 --> 08:19.050
that bankrupt me
and ultimately lost me the game,

08:19.153 --> 08:20.672
and consequently
sent me to

08:20.776 --> 08:23.468
the Chastity Bainbridge
Disciplinary School

08:23.572 --> 08:25.505
for Overprivileged Girls.

08:25.608 --> 08:27.576
Now I understand why you
struggle so much with losing.

08:27.679 --> 08:30.613
Yes, but, uh,
I want to change.

08:30.717 --> 08:32.719
I want to be able to go out
and have a casual night

08:32.822 --> 08:35.584
with my friends, and, Sam,
I just feel like with your help,

08:35.687 --> 08:37.068
I can achieve that.

08:39.415 --> 08:41.210
Okay, fine.
We can play trivia tonight.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.040
But the moment it stops
being fun, we are leaving.

08:44.144 --> 08:47.112
I gotchu
if you gotch me, girl.

08:53.015 --> 08:54.637
Hey.
Whatcha doing?

08:54.741 --> 08:56.812
I'm taking Charlotte on
a romantic picnic

08:56.915 --> 08:59.055
at the Observatory
before trivia night.

08:59.159 --> 09:00.263
She came up with
a good team name--

09:00.367 --> 09:02.265
- Roomies.
- Cool.

09:02.369 --> 09:03.819
Your neck looks
really angry.

09:03.922 --> 09:04.889
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

09:04.992 --> 09:06.649
I'm just trying to
get used to

09:06.753 --> 09:09.341
this poncho
Charlotte got me.

09:09.445 --> 09:11.274
She said I look like
Keanu Reeves in <i>Point Break.</i>

09:11.378 --> 09:13.518
I looked it up
and [chuckles] he's very hot.

09:13.622 --> 09:15.831
- I thought you only wore cotton.
- You only wear cotton!

09:15.934 --> 09:17.073
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

09:17.177 --> 09:19.593
I'm--
I'm just very tired.

09:19.697 --> 09:21.008
Hey, Nell.

09:21.112 --> 09:22.769
You ready, Johnny Utah?

09:22.872 --> 09:24.494
Yeah.
I love the way that feels.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.014
100% pure adrenaline.
Come on. Let's go.

09:27.118 --> 09:29.189
- Bye.
- Yeah.

09:29.292 --> 09:30.673
- Have fun!
- Surf's up.

09:32.641 --> 09:36.368
Hey, Marlena,
does Edward seem off to you?

09:36.472 --> 09:38.094
I-I mean, like,
he says he's happy,

09:38.198 --> 09:39.993
but he just seems
so exhausted, and--

09:40.096 --> 09:40.994
Maybe it's all the sex?

09:42.340 --> 09:45.446
I know when I first
met my wife,

09:45.550 --> 09:47.828
we couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

09:47.932 --> 09:49.105
It was a romp fest.

09:49.209 --> 09:50.555
Oh, right.
That reminds me.

09:50.659 --> 09:52.937
I wrote the opening paragraph
for your obituary,

09:53.040 --> 09:54.145
and I think
you're gonna love it.

09:54.248 --> 09:55.698
Let's hear it.

09:55.802 --> 09:58.356
"While millions loved watching
sexy, conniving villainess

09:58.459 --> 10:01.877
Marlena Quintrell manipulate
the men of Middleton Falls,

10:01.980 --> 10:04.673
she saved the juiciest twist
of all for her private life,

10:04.776 --> 10:07.468
when her cast mate husband
caught her in bed

10:07.572 --> 10:10.540
with her female makeup artist
and soon-to-be wife."

10:10.644 --> 10:11.507
Pretty spicy, huh?

10:12.888 --> 10:14.993
Honestly, I think you have
some more work to do.

10:15.994 --> 10:17.547
What are you talking about?

10:17.651 --> 10:19.722
Look, it's got
everything you love--

10:19.826 --> 10:21.310
suspense, intrigue,

10:21.413 --> 10:23.070
romance, beeping.

10:23.174 --> 10:24.831
Wait, sorry, do--
do you hear that?

10:26.591 --> 10:28.179
Is that coming from the box?

10:29.525 --> 10:30.906
<i>ZAMATRON-X39:
Cower before me, traitor!</i>

10:31.009 --> 10:32.252
- Let's see.
<i>- ZAMATRON-X39: For I have taken</i>

10:32.355 --> 10:33.840
<i>the life force
of countless Bezalids!</i>

10:33.943 --> 10:36.566
Oh, it's one of
his <i>Star Rim</i> figurines.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.568
It's from
his favorite video game.

10:38.672 --> 10:39.984
Yeah, it's like everything
that brings him joy.

10:40.087 --> 10:42.089
His magic tricks
and his Rubik's Cube

10:42.193 --> 10:45.058
and his
video game paraphernalia.

10:45.161 --> 10:46.991
Huh.

10:47.094 --> 10:48.061
I thought he was just hiding

10:48.164 --> 10:49.510
his anal apartment rules
from Charlotte.

10:49.614 --> 10:52.272
I didn't realize
that he was hiding...

10:52.375 --> 10:54.205
himself.

10:54.308 --> 10:55.724
Why do you think
he would do that?

10:57.311 --> 11:00.038
You have to go ask him.

11:01.246 --> 11:03.593
- Hey, you're back.
- I forgot our collapsible cups.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.423
Right. Um...

11:05.526 --> 11:08.357
You know, your robot monster
in the box was beeping.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.739
My Zamatron-X39 with the
dual engine laser blasters?

11:10.842 --> 11:12.223
- Yep.
- Is he okay?

11:12.326 --> 11:13.534
Yeah, I turned it off.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.882
Okay.
The galaxy thanks you.

11:15.985 --> 11:18.229
Um, hey, hey, wait.

11:18.332 --> 11:21.439
Uh, I couldn't help but notice
everything else in the box.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.785
I-I mean, I know
it's none of my business,

11:22.889 --> 11:25.201
but, um, it just--

11:25.305 --> 11:28.688
it just feels like you're hiding
all your favorite things away.

11:28.791 --> 11:31.414
Okay. Thank you for
your wholly unsolicited advice.

11:31.518 --> 11:33.589
You haven't really enjoyed
yourself since she's been here.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.901
I'm perfectly happy.

11:35.004 --> 11:36.074
You're definitely not.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.491
You're just my roommate, Nell.

11:39.595 --> 11:40.976
Okay?

11:41.079 --> 11:42.771
Stay out of it.

11:48.121 --> 11:49.501
- Are you kidding me?
- Nope.

11:49.605 --> 11:51.572
Then he said,
"You're just my roommate.

11:51.676 --> 11:52.919
Stay out of it."

11:53.022 --> 11:55.335
And I'm like, I'm supposed
to say something, though, right?

11:55.438 --> 11:57.233
I just think it's best
to tread lightly

11:57.337 --> 11:59.166
when criticizing
someone else's relationship.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.996
Mm, is it, though?

12:01.099 --> 12:03.619
Look, when I told you to go
a little slower with Phillip,

12:03.723 --> 12:04.827
you didn't exactly
love that.

12:04.931 --> 12:07.485
Okay, but I was only mad at you
for, like, a minute.

12:07.588 --> 12:09.314
- Excuse you.
- Or two years.

12:09.418 --> 12:11.178
That's right. So maybe Edward
just needs to figure it out

12:11.282 --> 12:13.077
for himself, like you did.

12:13.180 --> 12:14.630
Hey, Roomie. Oh.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.665
Get over here.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.495
Hmm.
Here we go.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.326
- Roomie.
- Roomie.

12:24.191 --> 12:28.023
Oh, everyone looks so
nice and friendly.

12:28.126 --> 12:30.715
Hello, fellow
trivia aficionados.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.855
Excited for
some playful sparring

12:32.959 --> 12:34.857
with all of you tonight.

12:34.961 --> 12:36.445
We're The Fun Bunch.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.205
- That's a pretty clever name.
- It is.

12:38.309 --> 12:39.862
What state school did you go to
to come up with that?

12:41.484 --> 12:42.969
Hey!

12:44.211 --> 12:46.869
Have you ever tried gouda?

12:46.973 --> 12:49.285
It's the most fun
of the cheeses.

12:49.389 --> 12:51.701
It's a real gift
to the palate.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.187
- That is the spirit, Lexi, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

12:54.290 --> 12:57.190
We will have fun,
and that is the point, okay?

12:57.293 --> 12:58.674
How's everybody doing?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.021
Whoo! Trivia!

13:01.125 --> 13:04.128
First category is Magic,

13:04.231 --> 13:06.786
kind of like me on this mic.

13:06.889 --> 13:11.411
This turn-of-the-20th century
magician became so famous

13:11.514 --> 13:16.312
that his traveling magic show
required eight train cars.

13:16.416 --> 13:17.727
God, I don't know
anything about magic.

13:17.831 --> 13:19.246
- Nell?
- Mm.

13:19.350 --> 13:20.696
If I was to guess,
I would say, mm,

13:20.800 --> 13:22.042
greatest magician
of all time...

13:22.146 --> 13:23.699
Let's go with...

13:23.803 --> 13:24.976
Criss Angel?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.807
No! Criss Angel is a hack
and an embarrassment,

13:27.910 --> 13:30.361
and Criss Angel wasn't
the turn of the 20th century.

13:30.464 --> 13:31.707
It's Howard Thurston.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.984
Oh.

13:33.088 --> 13:34.503
Babe, how do you know
so much about magic?

13:36.022 --> 13:39.059
My nephew is in a bit
of a magic phase right now.

13:39.163 --> 13:41.165
He doesn't shut up about it.

13:41.268 --> 13:43.581
He's kind of a doofus.

13:43.684 --> 13:45.548
Just sounds like your nephew
knows who he is

13:45.652 --> 13:46.826
and is fine with it

13:46.929 --> 13:49.690
and, you know, doesn't mind
letting his nerd flag fly.

13:49.794 --> 13:51.554
Yeah. He's a doofus.

13:51.658 --> 13:52.935
Okay, you write whatever
you want to write down.

13:53.039 --> 13:55.386
I'm just--
I-I need a break.

13:55.489 --> 13:56.456
Um...

13:59.045 --> 14:00.874
Ah! Oh.
Hello.

14:00.978 --> 14:03.187
You're being too subtle
with Edward.

14:03.290 --> 14:05.396
You need to be more direct.

14:05.499 --> 14:07.432
Tell him he can't hide
his true self.

14:07.536 --> 14:08.709
Oh, Marlena, come on.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.815
Just stop pushing the drama, okay?

14:10.919 --> 14:13.611
This is my life,
not some silly soap opera.

14:13.714 --> 14:17.442
Well, my life isn't
any silly soap opera either,

14:17.546 --> 14:19.203
which is why I hated
what you wrote.

14:19.306 --> 14:21.067
- What?
- What you referred to

14:21.170 --> 14:22.758
as "the juiciest twist
of all"

14:22.862 --> 14:24.967
was one of the most painful
things I've ever been through.

14:25.071 --> 14:26.555
Oh.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.247
I spent so many years
in the closet,

14:29.351 --> 14:31.456
trying to live up
to expectations,

14:31.560 --> 14:36.254
and I wasted so much time
denying who I was.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.740
I could've been with my wife
so much sooner

14:39.844 --> 14:42.847
if a friend would have just
told me what I needed to hear,

14:42.951 --> 14:47.852
just someone to encourage
my genuine, authentic self.

14:49.509 --> 14:53.444
Pretending to be someone you're
not on the screen is one thing,

14:53.547 --> 14:56.654
but pretending
in your personal life

14:56.757 --> 14:59.105
is just downright debilitating.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.314
Help him.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.937
I--

15:04.041 --> 15:06.077
I wouldn't say
he thinks we're friends.

15:06.181 --> 15:08.769
Well, that's a shame,

15:08.873 --> 15:10.530
'cause it sure looks
like you are to me.

15:12.118 --> 15:14.327
- Yeah?
- Yes.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.125
Thanks, Marlena.

15:20.989 --> 15:23.094
I'm gonna write you
that obituary you deserve.

15:23.198 --> 15:24.958
Oh, I know you are...

15:25.062 --> 15:26.477
...or I'll posses
someone you love.

15:26.580 --> 15:28.203
Oh.

15:28.306 --> 15:29.376
My life is weird.

15:31.137 --> 15:33.794
Uh, um, excuse me, Edward,
could we talk privately?

15:33.898 --> 15:35.727
Um, I-I need to talk to you
about the electric bill.

15:35.831 --> 15:38.178
I don't want to talk about
the electric bill.

15:38.282 --> 15:39.214
Yeah, well,
unless we talk about it,

15:39.317 --> 15:40.284
then the power's
gonna get shut off

15:40.387 --> 15:41.906
and we're going to waste
a lot of oat milk.

15:42.010 --> 15:43.839
- Oat milk doesn't go bad.
- Just come with me.

15:46.566 --> 15:47.394
Thank you. Mm.

15:51.398 --> 15:53.124
What?

15:53.228 --> 15:54.712
Look, I, um--

15:54.815 --> 15:56.679
I know you only think of me
as your roommate,

15:56.783 --> 16:01.167
but I think of you as my friend,
and as your friend,

16:01.270 --> 16:02.513
I'm gonna tell you
what you need to hear.

16:02.616 --> 16:03.514
Mm-hmm.

16:05.378 --> 16:07.725
What you're doing
is not healthy.

16:07.828 --> 16:09.589
Hiding who you are, you're not
just lying to Charlotte.

16:09.692 --> 16:10.693
You're lying to yourself.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.145
Nell, I'm 35 years old,

16:14.249 --> 16:15.526
and I'm tired
of being alone.

16:17.079 --> 16:18.874
And I can tell that you like

16:18.978 --> 16:20.048
this version of me better, anyway.

16:21.566 --> 16:23.016
I genuinely like
the real you.

16:24.776 --> 16:28.608
You're smart and you're funny
and you're wildly honest,

16:28.711 --> 16:31.093
which can be,
uh, really frustrating,

16:31.197 --> 16:33.440
but it's also
so very refreshing.

16:35.442 --> 16:37.375
If you really want to give
this relationship a chance,

16:37.479 --> 16:40.171
you got to show Charlotte
who you really are, okay?

16:40.275 --> 16:42.587
You both deserve that.

16:45.280 --> 16:46.798
Okay, I trust you.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.594
Okay.

16:49.698 --> 16:52.735
Also, by the way, I-I did forget
to pay the electric bill.

16:52.839 --> 16:54.013
I'll see you inside.

16:55.255 --> 16:58.396
It's like living
with a child.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.743
Don't be sad that you're losing,
State School.

17:00.847 --> 17:04.644
I didn't go to a state school.
I went to the Olympics.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.404
Oh, let me guess-- dressage?

17:06.508 --> 17:07.888
Uh?

17:07.992 --> 17:10.029
Look at me.
I'm riding a fancy horse.

17:10.132 --> 17:11.375
Oh, fancy.
Stop it.

17:11.478 --> 17:12.410
That's not proper form!

17:12.514 --> 17:14.619
I'm sorry, Sam,
but I need to leave.

17:14.723 --> 17:17.070
I am on the verge of becoming
a version of myself

17:17.174 --> 17:18.623
that not a lot of people
like to be around,

17:18.727 --> 17:20.901
and, frankly, I don't
really care for it, either.

17:21.005 --> 17:22.041
No, no, stay.

17:23.352 --> 17:25.216
I am so proud of all the work
that you've done here tonight,

17:25.320 --> 17:27.460
but I don't want to change
completely who you are,

17:27.563 --> 17:29.496
because I think
all of us could use

17:29.600 --> 17:30.980
a little cutthroat Lexi
right now.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.155
Mm.

17:33.259 --> 17:34.225
Are you saying...?

17:34.329 --> 17:35.261
Let's cut a bitch.

17:37.366 --> 17:38.816
There we go.
- Hold these.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.164
Let's [bleep] up, boys.

17:42.268 --> 17:43.683
Name the state capital of--

17:43.786 --> 17:46.030
Boise. Dover. Phoenix.
Little Rock. Juneau. Jackson.

17:46.134 --> 17:47.411
Topeka. Trenton. Bismarck.

17:47.514 --> 17:48.860
Stop me when you've
heard it, Cricket.

17:48.964 --> 17:50.759
- Topeka!
- The Golden City.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.036
Giddy up, turds.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.796
- Houdini.
- Yes.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.350
<i>- Space Invaders.</i>
- Yes.

17:55.453 --> 17:57.110
- Megatron.
- Yes.

17:57.214 --> 17:59.112
<i>- Invader Zim.</i>
- Yes.

17:59.216 --> 18:01.528
- Oh, my God!
- Bull

18:01.632 --> 18:02.805
<i>Invasion of
the Body Snatchers.</i>

18:02.909 --> 18:04.945
- Whoo!
- The 1978 version.

18:07.879 --> 18:11.159
This multi-player video game
takes place in outer space,

18:11.262 --> 18:15.128
and it contains
over 600 hours of gameplay.

18:15.232 --> 18:17.682
<i>Star Rim,</i> and it actually
contains over 600 hours

18:17.786 --> 18:19.995
of potential gameplay.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.962
The main storyline
can be completed in

18:22.066 --> 18:23.688
as little as 200 hours,

18:23.792 --> 18:25.207
as seen in the
speed run performed by

18:25.311 --> 18:29.004
Underscore IceKing32
on Twitch.

18:31.800 --> 18:34.803
<i>And now it is time
to announce the final scores.</i>

18:34.906 --> 18:39.048
P.H. Deez Nuts coming in
at a hot 38 points.

18:40.498 --> 18:43.225
And then making news
back there is The Fun Bunch

18:43.329 --> 18:46.504
- with a whopping 46 points.
- Yes!

18:46.608 --> 18:50.750
And coming in
at a staggering 62 points,

18:50.853 --> 18:52.855
it's The Roomies!
Yay!

18:52.959 --> 18:55.375
Yes! Dude!

18:56.997 --> 18:59.172
I had no idea
that you knew so much

18:59.276 --> 19:02.382
about all that stuff
you knew about.

19:03.556 --> 19:06.248
Charlotte, my nephew
isn't a doofus.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.180
I'm a doofus.

19:08.664 --> 19:10.666
If this relationship
is gonna work,

19:10.770 --> 19:13.600
I think you need to know
that I'm a video-game-playing,

19:13.704 --> 19:16.120
Rubik's-Cube-solving,
action-figure-collecting nerd.

19:17.363 --> 19:18.847
And also, Nell isn't
the one who's particular

19:18.950 --> 19:20.573
about skillet care.

19:20.676 --> 19:22.022
I am.

19:22.126 --> 19:24.197
Yeah.

19:24.301 --> 19:26.889
Also, this, um, poncho,
it feels like sandpaper,

19:26.993 --> 19:29.444
and I'm gonna take it off forever.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.688
Okay, okay.

19:35.726 --> 19:37.935
And I do magic.

19:39.937 --> 19:41.697
Is this your coaster?

19:43.251 --> 19:45.080
- It is now.
- There he is.

19:45.184 --> 19:48.428
Um...

19:48.532 --> 19:51.776
I am so happy
that we're being honest,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.985
because I have been holding
back some things, as well.

19:54.089 --> 19:57.057
Um, Edward, I know you're
an environmental lawyer...

19:59.059 --> 19:59.991
...but I hate
these paper straws.

20:00.095 --> 20:02.580
They're completely useless.

20:02.684 --> 20:05.204
Besides, how much can
one person really do

20:05.307 --> 20:06.550
for the environment, anyway?

20:06.653 --> 20:09.415
And does recycling
really matter?

20:10.899 --> 20:13.453
- Huh.
- Whew.

20:13.557 --> 20:14.661
I'm gonna go get us
some real straws.

20:19.701 --> 20:21.220
I'm gonna have to
tell my parents

20:21.323 --> 20:22.911
I'm sleeping
with a turtle murderer.

20:29.055 --> 20:31.160
Hey.
How'd it go with Charlotte?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.784
Charlotte confessed
that the compost bin I got her

20:33.887 --> 20:35.510
is where she keeps
her keys and her wallet.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.513
I confessed that <i>Hoarders</i>
gives me night terrors.

20:38.616 --> 20:40.446
Mm
- So...

20:40.549 --> 20:42.344
- we decided to take a break.
- Aww.

20:42.448 --> 20:44.691
I think I was so focused
on what she wanted,

20:44.795 --> 20:48.039
I didn't really take the time
to consider what I wanted.

20:48.143 --> 20:49.420
- What is this?
- I thought you should know

20:49.524 --> 20:50.766
that you don't have to hide
who you are around me.

20:50.870 --> 20:53.666
There are no Rat Archers
in <i>Star Rim,</i> but thank you.

20:53.769 --> 20:55.978
You got it.

20:56.082 --> 20:58.222
And just so you know,
I'm not going to hide

20:58.326 --> 21:00.949
who I am around you either.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.157
Hmm?

21:03.158 --> 21:05.885
Okay, I'll let you be
a little disgusting troll...

21:05.988 --> 21:07.852
Oh!

21:07.956 --> 21:09.302
...because
you're my friend.

21:09.406 --> 21:11.960
You said it.
I'm your friend.

21:12.063 --> 21:13.237
- I'm your friend?
- Yeah.

21:13.341 --> 21:15.860
I'm your friend?
You're my friend.

21:15.964 --> 21:16.896
I don't like that.
I don't like that.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.069
Okay. No backsies.

21:19.795 --> 21:20.727
Whoops.

21:20.831 --> 21:22.522
I am saying this
as your friend.

21:22.626 --> 21:24.524
- Yeah?
- You're a terrible roommate.
