[Dulcie] It is very possible that

00:07.640 --> 00:09.960
the murders of
Trent Latham, Gavin Latham,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.120
Rod Dixon and Sam O'Dwyer

00:13.120 --> 00:15.480
are the actions of
a female serial killer

00:15.480 --> 00:18.240
who uses pentobarbital
to sedate her victims

00:18.240 --> 00:21.400
before she cuts out their tongues
and strangles them.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.480
Yesterday, they found Dad's body
at Deadloch Lake.

say anything about it,

"Oh, my God, she doesn't know."

probably don't know, either.

her Dad's affairs?

[indistinct]

10:20.280 --> 10:23.320
You don't know what you're saying.
You're not thinking clearly.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.120
She should cancel the Feastival,
shouldn't she, Dulcie?

10:26.120 --> 10:28.040
Uh, absolutely. Aleyna.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.200
You absolutely have to
cancel the Feastival.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.440
Five men are dead.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
You're right.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.120
I'll do a 24-hour snap suspension

10:36.120 --> 10:39.520
but only once we've done
the Dress Your Dog Like A Hero parade.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.760
People need this, Dulcie.
Don't make me cancel the dog parade.

10:42.760 --> 10:45.320
I'm so proud of you, sweetpea.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.480
- Aren't we, Dulce?
- Yeah, we are. We are super-proud.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.520
Now, can you run me through
what happened?

10:49.520 --> 10:52.000
Aleyna screamed, then we ran
down to the rocks

10:52.000 --> 10:53.640
and then...

10:53.640 --> 10:57.160
I saw Jimmy hanging there
like a bathrobe on a hook.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.520
I, um

11:02.520 --> 11:05.240
I really enjoyed last night,
in Cath's ute.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.680
What?

11:06.680 --> 11:07.680
Oh, that.

11:08.720 --> 11:09.920
Yeah.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.920
Yeah, cool. We can, ah...

11:11.920 --> 11:13.280
We can escalate that at some point.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.640
I've got, ah...

11:14.640 --> 11:17.880
tits, vag, et cetera.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.400
You got a spot you go to,
let me know.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.240
- Spot?
- Yeah.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.000
Doesn't have to be horizontal,
doesn't have to be a big place.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.800
Portaloo, whatever.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.200
You're a meaty, meaty lad.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.880
Reckon we could go portrait mode.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.160
How do you spell
your last name again?

11:32.160 --> 11:33.840
Is it P-I-E-S? Ray Pies?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.800
Oh, Pies isn't my last name.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.160
- Why is it in my phone like that?
- I don't know.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.560
Um... I think I'm gonna throw up.

11:40.560 --> 11:41.760
Oh.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.280
- OK, yep. That's the shock.
- [coughs]

11:44.280 --> 11:47.240
- Let it out.
- [coughs]

11:50.080 --> 11:52.040
Word of advice.

11:52.040 --> 11:55.000
Press the memory of what happened
today, like, down, you know?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.040
Like, really far down.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.840
Because the faster you do that,

11:58.840 --> 12:01.560
the faster you'll get him
out of the corner of your eye, you know?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.200
watching you as you put your tampon in.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.960
OK.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.440
See you later for a fuck.

12:09.240 --> 12:10.360
Right.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.800
[Dulcie] So Mike was the last person
to see Jimmy alive?

12:15.800 --> 12:19.880
Ah, yes, he escorted Jimmy home
to his residential meat locker at 11pm

12:19.880 --> 12:22.680
when Jimmy was going inside to "relax"
with a photo of Susan Sarandon.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.120
Now, I think that's
Mike's way of saying...

12:24.120 --> 12:25.280
Ah, yes, Sven, I get that. Ta.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.800
Abby, look, I know that
you're really busy,

12:26.800 --> 12:28.840
you just lost your celebrant,
but if there's any way we can...

12:28.840 --> 12:30.760
Um, ma'am, is it OK
if we don't talk about that right now?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.880
- Because I might cry.
- Yep. No, absolutely, yep.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.760
If you could get over to Jimmy's
and locate his phone?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.000
Mm-hm. Yes, ma'am.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.160
And wear gloves! Wear gloves.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.280
- Double glove.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.240
Steve, it's safe to say
there is a new kill room in operation.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.040
Contact the Harbour Office,

12:43.040 --> 12:44.960
see if they've spotted
any unfamiliar vessels.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.320
On it.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.600
Are you? Are you, Steve?
You're on it, are you?

12:49.920 --> 12:51.400
OK.

12:51.400 --> 12:56.000
Um, Sven, set up
a public information booth, offsite.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.800
See if we can funnel
the public's hysteria

12:57.800 --> 12:59.680
somewhere that isn't
the front desk of my station.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.160
OK, you thinking like a pop-up tent,
or something a bit more structural?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.320
You know, I empower you to
make that choice yourself, Sven.

13:04.320 --> 13:05.800
- Love it, love you.
- [phone buzzes]

13:05.800 --> 13:07.640
- It's Commissioner Hastings.
- Bump him!

13:07.640 --> 13:10.160
No, I'm not gonna bump
the Tasmania Chief of Police.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.640
Fucking suck job.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.920
Commissioner Hastings.

13:12.920 --> 13:15.360
What in the shit-stain arse of hell
is going on down there?

13:15.360 --> 13:17.920
- Ah, look, sir, I know it's bad...
- Five bloody victims!

13:17.920 --> 13:20.320
A press conference at which
a member of the press announced

13:20.320 --> 13:21.760
there was a serial killer,

13:21.760 --> 13:24.240
the lead detective fainting
on top of a slippery dip,

13:24.240 --> 13:27.680
then this morning another body,
strung up like fucking Mr Squiggle.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.200
It's not bad, Connell.
It's a code-black disaster.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.880
The killer, sir,
we are narrowing the profile...

13:32.880 --> 13:34.800
Then there's the conversation
I had with James.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
The poor bloke is snowed under
with your requests.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.160
Sorry, has James contacted you directly?

13:40.160 --> 13:42.000
- I play golf with his Dad.
- [whispers] Fucking wanker!

13:42.000 --> 13:45.160
You two and your investigation
are embarrassing me.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.200
Pull your bloody mooncups out

13:47.200 --> 13:49.960
and bring me a viable suspect
in the next 12 hours

13:49.960 --> 13:52.720
or I'm ripping you both off the case
and sending some blokes down there.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.960
- Do you hear me?
- Ah, yes sir.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.920
Ah, Commissioner Hastings,
this might be the wrong time...

13:55.920 --> 13:57.240
'Ken oath it's not the time!

13:57.240 --> 13:59.640
Yeah, but, look, the media
are camped up our fucking bum holes

13:59.640 --> 14:00.920
like anal nomads, mate.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.680
I fucking feel 'em right up there!

14:02.680 --> 14:04.200
- Fine.
- What?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.400
I'll put a suppression order
on the press, I'll get you warrants.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.080
I'll get you a gift-wrapped
fucking sampler of court orders.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.040
Just bring me a fucking suspect
or you're done!

14:12.040 --> 14:13.520
[ship horn blares]

14:14.680 --> 14:16.000
I've got to go.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.880
We're getting the ferry to MONA.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.200
I gotta get there before
the cloaca does a shit.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.880
Too-rah.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.000
Oh, fuck.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.600
Yeah, good, good. That's so good,
to feel the heat from all sides.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.040
That way you get cooked alive faster.
Let's get to St Drogo's.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.880
[bells toll]

14:38.880 --> 14:41.640
[man] Well, I never thought
I'd be shocked by this town

14:41.640 --> 14:44.200
given the decades
I've heard of their confessions.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.120
But a serial killer,
doing something like that?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.400
I mean, that's a bit much, isn't it?

14:49.400 --> 14:51.440
I... I'd say so, yes.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.240
As you can see... Father,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.440
I've got her to add the snail trail
for extra realism...

14:56.440 --> 14:59.640
Ah, the snail trail has nothing
to do with the case, Father.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.960
To-may-to, po-tah-to.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.920
You know Ed Gien?
He used to skin his victims.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.880
- Did he?
- Oh, yes, yeah.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.280
He made a belt out of nipples once.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.920
Ah, OK, good to know.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.840
Oh, well, yes.
No, you were right about that pose.

15:15.840 --> 15:19.280
You see, that does not suggest
Jesus on the crucifix.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.680
Whereas... this

15:21.680 --> 15:23.320
There we are.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.600
That's Luke 26:39.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.520
Gestas and Dismas. Of course.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.560
So at the crucifixion,
Jesus was crucified alongside two men.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.560
They were both hung with ropes.

15:32.560 --> 15:34.280
Dismas repented for his sins,

15:34.280 --> 15:37.880
but Gestas, the impenitent thief,
died a sinner

15:37.880 --> 15:39.920
and wasn't welcomed
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.480
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:45.480 --> 15:46.920
Wow.

15:46.920 --> 15:48.480
Wow, that was...

15:48.480 --> 15:50.280
That was a real peep
behind the curtain wasn't it?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.320
No, that's not...

15:51.320 --> 15:53.000
- That explains a lot, actually.
- Sorry, Father.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.920
Father, um...

15:54.920 --> 15:59.120
are any of these women
regulars at St Drogo's?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.680
Oh, that's Vanessa.
Vanessa and Dolph Latham.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.040
Yeah, they were regulars.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.200
And Trent would come occasionally.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.720
But that was usually when he was
selling Pro-Bro to pensioners.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.520
Vanessa was at the crime scene
this morning.

16:09.520 --> 16:10.600
Yeah.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.120
Oh, and the O'Dwyers.
Oh, they were regular parishioners.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.360
- The O'Dwyers? Really?
- Yeah.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.880
I've never heard Vic or Skye
talk about religion.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.880
They normally just argue about

16:19.880 --> 16:22.440
how Skye's pretty face
is ruined by her boy hair.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.480
Oh, no, the O'Dwyers, they were here
every week when Skye was a teenager.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.320
- Right.
- And then she went away, of course.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.200
Yes, and we all know
what happened to Sam.

16:34.760 --> 16:35.840
He died.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.600
- He did. Yeah.
- Yeah, that's it.

16:37.600 --> 16:38.680
[both] Yeah.

16:38.680 --> 16:39.800
OK, thank you Father.

16:39.800 --> 16:41.200
You know, I should...
I should tell you,

16:41.200 --> 16:44.320
I'm actually tinkering with a screenplay

16:44.320 --> 16:47.440
about a priest who gets to
solve some sexy murders.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.840
I'd love to pick your brain.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.800
Ah, yeah, that...
that sounds really good.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.680
Father, could we bother you for
a list of your regular parishioners?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.360
- Oh, of course. I'll fax them over.
- OK.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.360
With my screenplay.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.840
- Mmm.
- Wonderful. That that sounds ideal.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.839
Alright, you have
a good old Jesusy day, sir.

17:04.839 --> 17:08.359
God... Father... date... Jesus.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.680
[stammers]

17:15.000 --> 17:16.440
I don't know what to fucking say.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.319
I think there's a very strict
religious upbringing at play here.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.720
Residual guilt, shame, repression.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.680
It can all be a trigger for rage.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.480
Are we talking about you
or the killer, here?

17:26.480 --> 17:29.560
What? The fucking damage
is baked on, mate. Not like me.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.040
I didn't grow up religious.
Nothing much wrong with me.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.400
[burps loudly]

17:33.400 --> 17:34.480
- [Megan] Detectives!
- Oh, God!

17:34.480 --> 17:35.880
Oh, fucking hell!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.200
That rat cunt Megan's got predator eyes.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.000
She's like a fucking mantis shrimp.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
- Is Father Terrence under suspicion?
- [chiming]

17:42.000 --> 17:43.760
Unlock the fucking... Hey!

17:43.760 --> 17:45.560
[chiming]

17:46.640 --> 17:48.000
What the hell?

17:48.000 --> 17:51.560
Oh-ho! How's that for timing, hey?

17:51.560 --> 17:53.800
Looks like our favourite
resident rat cunt

17:53.800 --> 17:56.080
just got hit with
a media suppression order.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.000
Tough titties, fuckos!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.880
Shame you can't report on
any murder cases

17:59.880 --> 18:03.880
that might be getting into this car
in front of your very fucking eyes.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.080
[Dulcie] Abby, how'd you go?

18:09.080 --> 18:12.280
I found Jimmy's phone
and I managed to unlock it.

18:12.280 --> 18:15.320
His password was "phone"
without the "e", "phon".

18:15.320 --> 18:17.800
He called Vanessa,
like, 30 times last night,

18:17.800 --> 18:20.560
and the last call was at 12:23am.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.400
Jimmy's place is very bare.

18:22.400 --> 18:27.960
There's just a lot of photos of boats
and heaps of pictures of Vanessa Latham.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.920
Let's get over there.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.040
Constable, we'll head to
the Lathams' now.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.320
[Sven] One at a time! One...
Just one at a time, please!

18:35.320 --> 18:38.160
Please, if you have information
about the murders

18:38.160 --> 18:41.480
I can take your statement
in the privacy of the Oyster Cloister.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.960
Or, if you prefer,
you can just write a note,

18:42.960 --> 18:46.160
and put it
in the anonymous tip-off koala.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.560
- OK? Those are the rules.
- Sven, Sven!

18:47.560 --> 18:50.240
My neighbour's pouring
a concrete slab in his backyard,

18:50.240 --> 18:52.160
and my wife says
she doesn't love me anymore.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.080
- OK.
- [crowd] Sven! Sven!

18:55.080 --> 18:57.200
- Um...
[crowd calls out indistinctly]

18:57.200 --> 19:00.760
What's going on around here?
You doing a bit of a Marie Konda?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.800
Phil's kicking us out
because we can't pay rent.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.320
Dolph, that's none of their business.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.920
Mum, can I throw these photo scraps?

19:06.920 --> 19:08.280
There's no space in Sharelle's caravan.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.800
No, keep them.

19:09.800 --> 19:12.720
They're all we have left since
someone stole our photo board.

19:14.960 --> 19:17.680
Ah, Vanessa,
we've located Jimmy Cook's phone,

19:17.680 --> 19:19.680
and it showed that
he called you last night.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.920
- No, he didn't.
- Yes he did, roughly 30 times.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.760
His phone records prove it.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.920
And then a few hours later,
he turns out dead on the beach,

19:26.920 --> 19:29.400
the same beach that
you visited this morning.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.640
Vanessa, we know that Sharelle
was around here last night,

19:33.640 --> 19:35.920
telling Jimmy to stay away from you.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.440
Was he giving you trouble?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.720
I suggest you tell us
what's going on, Mrs Statham.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.080
We've got you linked to
Trent, Gavin and Jimmy

19:42.080 --> 19:43.760
and if we find out
you hooked up with Rod and Sam,

19:43.760 --> 19:46.280
- then it is beef curtains for you...
- Oh, my God!

19:47.400 --> 19:49.480
You lot don't understand
heterosexuals, do you?

19:49.480 --> 19:50.680
Well, she doesn't.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.320
Jimmy was harassing me
because he was in love with me.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.240
Men have always been obsessed with me
because of my looks.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.800
Jimmy was just calling me

19:57.800 --> 20:01.280
because he was trying to help me
with my financial situation.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.000
How? Jimmy was skint.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.920
Was he planning on selling
his fapped-on tracksuits on eBay?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.520
I don't know,
because I didn't want his help.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.720
I didn't even answer his calls, did I?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.720
As if I was going to move in with him.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.400
I'm a grieving wreck!

20:13.400 --> 20:15.240
Where were you last night

20:15.240 --> 20:17.800
between the hours
of 12:23am and 5am, Mrs Statham,

20:17.800 --> 20:19.080
if indeed that is your name.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.320
- I was here...
- That's not her name.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.880
...packing up our home.
Wasn't I, Dolphy?

20:22.880 --> 20:25.480
Yeah, she sorted everything into
colour groups all night.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.000
Put this with the reds.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.040
Ugh!

20:29.520 --> 20:31.440
So you didn't see Jimmy at all?

20:31.440 --> 20:34.040
No, I was here.
Are you not listening to me?

20:34.040 --> 20:36.880
And don't throw that out.
You put that banana back in the bowl.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.440
That was Trent's favourite.
His favourite banana.

20:41.760 --> 20:44.240
Is it possible to be
too fucking crackers

20:44.240 --> 20:45.400
to be a serial killer?

20:45.400 --> 20:46.960
'Cause that's what that is in there.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.880
[Abby] Detectives! It's me.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.200
I'm in my incognito hatchback,
so I don't attract media attention!

20:52.200 --> 20:53.800
- Maybe keep the level down.
- Yeah, sorry.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.920
I've got Father Terrence's list
of parishioners here.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.320
He faxed it through
with four copies of his screenplay,

20:59.320 --> 21:01.080
one for each of us.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.560
It's called "Inspector Father".

21:03.560 --> 21:04.880
Great. Well, let's get a wriggle on.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.560
We've got about five minutes
to get another suspect

21:06.560 --> 21:07.800
before Hastings boots us.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.040
- What?
- [Eddie] Come on.

21:09.040 --> 21:10.520
I'll get in the back, Collins,

21:10.520 --> 21:12.320
so you've got room
for your endless fucking legs.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.560
Ah... Ah, you go.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.920
There's something I want to do first.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
Alright. Yeah, OK, yeah. Fuck.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.320
Sweet. Go for a stroll, mate, yeah.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.800
Go get your bumhole candled.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.480
- Oh, please.
- I'll fucking solve the crime.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.400
Fucking hell. [sighs]

21:26.400 --> 21:28.080
Who's on this priest list, then?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.160
Here you go, ma'am.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.520
What's this, "Marcel"?

21:32.520 --> 21:34.560
"Michelangelo"? What is that?

21:34.560 --> 21:36.440
This priest's handwriting's terrible.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.880
It's like fucking Wingdings.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.800
I think that says Michelle, ma'am.
She's the beautician.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.080
Ma'am, am I going to get fired, too?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.160
Oh, yeah.
You'll be the first one to go.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.280
- Really?
- Yeah, brace yourself for impact.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.280
No, I didn't hear anything
at the Lathams' last night.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.760
We all passed out
after that serial killer presser.

21:53.760 --> 21:56.240
Oh, thanks for the heads-up
about that, by the way.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.320
Sorry I couldn't say anything, Skye,
but it's protocol.

21:58.320 --> 22:00.080
I'm just saying
it would have been good to know

22:00.080 --> 22:03.120
before I forked out 4K
on Iberico ham.

22:03.120 --> 22:04.680
Also 'cause of your Dad, I suppose.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.600
Oh, let's just focus on the ham, Dulce.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.360
One trauma at a time. Fuck!

22:08.360 --> 22:09.560
- Mum.
- Hey, Tom.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.360
Can I have $30 for the sign-up fee?

22:11.360 --> 22:14.560
Mate, you're not joining the footy team.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.800
You'll end up roaming the streets
with those footy micro-thugs.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.400
And there's a killer on the loose,
isn't there, Dulce?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.440
There is, yep.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.880
My tap school in London
was above a mafia restaurant!

22:23.880 --> 22:25.440
But you and whoever
you were boning at the time

22:25.440 --> 22:27.200
still made me go every Saturday.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.200
Fuck, Mum!

22:28.200 --> 22:30.480
Fucking excuse me?
Watch your fucking language!

22:30.480 --> 22:31.720
- [bottles clink]
- Oof!

22:31.720 --> 22:33.760
I just wanted to hang out
with my fucking mates.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.440
They're not your mates!

22:36.440 --> 22:38.320
And their moustaches look like
fucking mouse pubes.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.640
You look like a pube!

22:39.640 --> 22:40.880
- Pfft.
- Wowee.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.560
How the fuck am I
the mother of a teenage boy?

22:43.560 --> 22:45.960
- Me!
- Yeah, my godson has a potty mouth.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.160
Skye, I just checked our account...

22:48.160 --> 22:50.280
Oh, hello. Hi, Dulcie. How are you?

22:50.280 --> 22:54.160
Ah, well, three men have died
in a week, so I could be better.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.800
I was actually just checking
whether you or Skye

22:56.800 --> 23:00.200
heard any disturbance
coming from the Lathams' last night.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.200
- No.
- No?

23:02.200 --> 23:03.840
And you were both home?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.320
Yep.

23:07.320 --> 23:08.800
We went to bed at 10pm.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.360
OK, I'm gonna go check on Mum,

23:13.360 --> 23:16.400
because, ah,
she found a dead body today.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.680
Your mum, not my mum.
My mum doesn't talk to me.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.600
She is a ho-mo-phobe.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.600
OK. Um, nice to... see you.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.920
Sorry, IVF hormones.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.200
Ah, I actually saw Vic
up at St Drogo's.

23:31.200 --> 23:32.680
- You want a hand with that?
- No.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.600
I didn't know that
your family were Catholic.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.680
- Oh, well, Dad was.
- Uh-huh.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.000
And Mum's a bit lapsed.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.080
Father Terrence said that
you stopped going to the parish.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
What happened?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.600
Same as you, Dulce.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.200
I got too fucking gay for it.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.040
- You still hate oysters?
- Mm.

23:47.040 --> 23:49.120
I got 300 that I can't return.

23:49.120 --> 23:53.440
No, very much not...
my thing, thank you.

23:53.440 --> 23:55.040
[exhales] Shame.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.040
Alright.
OK, I'll let you get back to it.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.480
Yeah, your loss.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.280
- Say hi to Vic for me.
- Yeah.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.520
Oh, my God.

24:26.520 --> 24:29.000
[Tammy] That little
music theatre dickshit.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.560
Why's Tom hanging out with them?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.960
What do they have that we don't?

24:32.960 --> 24:35.680
Dads. Diagnosed ADHD.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.360
- In your case, a girlfriend.
- Yeah, fuck off!

24:38.360 --> 24:40.560
Well, we fucking liked him
from the beginning.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.400
Just you wait until
he's quoting "Cats" at them.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.520
He'll come running back
with his tail between his legs.

24:46.480 --> 24:50.520
- How's that mask feeling, hon?
- It feels like lights.

24:50.520 --> 24:53.240
Good. It's meant to feel like that.

24:53.240 --> 24:58.560
So, Michelle, are you one of these
God-bothering Jesus lickers

24:58.560 --> 25:00.680
who hits up St Drogo's
on a regular, or...

25:00.680 --> 25:02.440
Oh, I'm at St Drogo's quite a bit,

25:02.440 --> 25:05.440
but I wouldn't say I'm religious,
or a parishioner.

25:05.440 --> 25:08.080
I'm more just woo, you know?

25:08.080 --> 25:10.680
I take Nola there three times a week.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.480
Obviously, I don't go on Thursdays...

25:18.400 --> 25:21.400
OK, Steve, so no unusual boat activity?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.600
Ah, right, well, start looking
up the coast.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.080
Ah, no, Steve,
it does not have to be a sloop.

25:29.080 --> 25:33.520
Just any boat that is big enough to
carry a massive crucifix and a body.

25:35.240 --> 25:38.080
Do you girls know
who's doing all this serial killing?

25:38.080 --> 25:39.840
Could be anyone, hey?

25:39.840 --> 25:41.080
I was saying this to Mikey last night,

25:41.080 --> 25:44.280
you can never tell what's going on
behind closed doors, can you?

25:44.280 --> 25:45.600
Like, are they watching Love Island,

25:45.600 --> 25:47.560
or have they got a severed head
in the freezer?

25:47.560 --> 25:49.600
- Oh, like Jeffrey Dahmer.
- Exactly!

25:49.600 --> 25:52.200
So who's this Nola you've been
taking up to church, then?

25:52.200 --> 25:54.320
Oh, she's the mum
of my best friend Mikey.

25:54.320 --> 25:57.800
The Nugents were like
a second family to me.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.200
My house was a bit crappy

25:59.200 --> 26:00.560
because Dad was the Senior Sergeant,

26:00.560 --> 26:02.880
and that messes you up
more than meth, doesn't it?

26:02.880 --> 26:04.880
Anyway, Nola's 87 now,

26:04.880 --> 26:07.920
and I take her to church
when Mikey can't.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.280
I don't think she takes much of it in.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.520
But she's always very happy to be there,

26:12.520 --> 26:14.800
even after Jimmy got his thingy out
in front of her.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.000
Jimmy did whatty?

26:17.000 --> 26:20.200
He wanked in front of her, at church.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.120
She was asleep at the time,
so I don't think she noticed.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.560
Mikey was furious when I told him.

26:25.560 --> 26:28.960
- I bet he was!
- Yeah! No, he wanted to kill him.

26:28.960 --> 26:34.360
But, to his credit, he channelled it
into some quiet journaling.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.760
Mikey's done a lot of work
on emotional regulation.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.600
Who the fuck's Mikey?

26:40.600 --> 26:42.680
- Mike Nuggets.
- It's Nugent.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.880
That's right. His mum, Nola,
is St Drogo's number-one parishioner.

26:45.880 --> 26:49.360
And Jimmy Cook fiddled with his diddle
in front of her.

26:49.360 --> 26:50.360
OK.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.440
No, that's more than OK,
it's a fucking lead.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.960
- What do we know about him?
- He's former Deadloch Police.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.440
He... He's fucking what?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.280
He left the force five years ago.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.160
Oh, what's the Venn diagram of
fucking police and serial killers?

27:01.160 --> 27:02.680
Surely it's a full fucking circle!

27:02.680 --> 27:04.600
Ooh, the Golden State Killer
was a cop!

27:04.600 --> 27:06.920
Ha! Queensland's own, Collins.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.360
And, ma'am, remember Mike called you

27:08.360 --> 27:11.200
about Detective Redcliffe
getting intoxicated at the pub?

27:11.200 --> 27:13.280
I think he's trying to insert himself
into the narrative.

27:13.280 --> 27:15.760
- Was he working Rod Dixon's
crime scene?
- Yes, but...

27:15.760 --> 27:17.640
Was it him that said that
Dixon was eaten by a seal?

27:17.640 --> 27:19.760
- I don't know, I...
- Well what else do we know?

27:19.760 --> 27:21.880
We know that he was the last person
to see Jimmy alive.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.080
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.920
He also works at the football club.

27:25.920 --> 27:27.280
Doing what?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.760
- He's the caretaker.
- Oh, Christ on a fucking corn thin!

27:31.760 --> 27:33.480
Next thing you'll be saying
he's a fucking bachelor

27:33.480 --> 27:34.840
who lives at home with his mum!

27:34.840 --> 27:37.160
He is a bachelor that
lives at home with his mum.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.880
When were you lot gonna fucking
tell me about this?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.520
Come on, Collins.
This is a suspect with a motive.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.320
We cannot afford to luxuriate in this

27:47.320 --> 27:49.240
like it's a fucking Sunday morning wank!

27:49.240 --> 27:51.160
I know that Mike
is looking incredibly viable,

27:51.160 --> 27:53.400
but our profile is for a woman.

27:53.400 --> 27:56.760
Well, fuck our profile, OK?
Let's go get Nuggets.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.480
Unless you have another suspect.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.960
Do ya?

27:59.960 --> 28:02.920
Hiya! I got a delivery for you.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.640
Sorry, excuse me. Who are you?
Are you Forensics?

28:05.640 --> 28:08.720
Oh... [laughs]
No, darl, we're Airtaskers.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.840
- [mouths]
- Airbus?

28:09.840 --> 28:11.280
- My son Nick. Say hi, Nick.
- Hi.

28:11.280 --> 28:14.000
This big cross is for
a Detective Sergeant Dulcie Collins.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.080
Is that you?

28:15.080 --> 28:16.600
- Ah, yes. But...
- Why did you order a cross?

28:16.600 --> 28:17.680
I didn't order that cross!

28:17.680 --> 28:19.560
Jimboybikebike booked us
to deliver it to you.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.840
Apparently he couldn't fit it
into his own place.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.200
Jimboybikebike,
that's James's profile name, ma'am.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.960
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, fucking shitwank.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.560
Put it down like that.
That's lovely. That's nice.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.000
No, that's not it. That is not nice,
Nick. No thanks.

28:31.000 --> 28:34.000
OK, come on, Collins.
Hastings wants a suspect.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.120
Let's go. Let's go get Nuggets, now!

28:36.120 --> 28:37.960
Oh, chicken nuggets are so processed.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.520
If you're hungry, I've got pistachios.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.200
There was a whole stall on the side
on the road of the Settler Highway.

28:42.200 --> 28:43.920
Ah, no. No, thank you. No nuts.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.440
- No?
- Detective!

28:45.440 --> 28:46.840
- Detective!

28:46.840 --> 28:48.920
- Jeez it's busy around here, isn't it?

28:48.920 --> 28:51.320
Yes, because there's
a murder investigation going on.

28:51.320 --> 28:54.400
- Oh...
- So I'm just gonna move this.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.960
[sniffs]

28:55.960 --> 28:57.720
Do you guys smell that?

28:57.720 --> 29:00.320
The wood smells like garlic,
but chemical.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.880
[sniffs] No. Maybe you're pregnant.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.640
You know,
when I was pregnant with Nick,

29:05.640 --> 29:07.560
I could smell everything, like a bear.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.520
- No!
- No, I could.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.960
OK, I've marked that job off
as completed. We're done.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.640
OK, well, congrats on the baby, darl.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.240
- And be careful of the rotten ones.
- The rotten ones?

29:20.240 --> 29:22.960
Pistachios.
The rotten ones contain arsenic.

29:42.520 --> 29:44.720
Poisoning is
the purview of female killers.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.680
I think it's really unwise to dump
our profile and pursue a man.

29:48.680 --> 29:52.040
Mate, men didn't use moisturiser
or know their kids' names

29:52.040 --> 29:53.440
when that profile was written.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.880
You need to update your thinking.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.480
It's like Sven always says,

29:56.480 --> 29:59.120
"Everyone deserves to be liberated
from the gender binary."

29:59.120 --> 30:01.720
I don't think Sven was talking
specifically about serial killers

30:01.720 --> 30:03.040
at that point, Detective.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.240
[Hunter] Oi, lezzos!

30:05.720 --> 30:08.000
Just fuck off, Tammy.
This is our ground.

30:08.000 --> 30:11.240
Is it? Is it really your ground,
you First Fleet dog?

30:11.240 --> 30:12.400
No-one fucking wants to see you

30:12.400 --> 30:15.160
getting your box out kicking
a fucking footy, Tammy. Give up!

30:15.160 --> 30:16.200
- [grunts]
- [groans]

30:16.200 --> 30:17.480
[boy] Oh, shit!

30:17.480 --> 30:19.200
You fucking hit me
with the fucking ball!

30:19.200 --> 30:20.720
Yeah, mate,
it's called hitting a target.

30:20.720 --> 30:23.400
Maybe if you could do that,
the recruiter would come see you too.

30:23.400 --> 30:27.240
Mike is connected to all the men,
working in this shit dude factory.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.160
Probably knows more about
the victims' sins than anyone.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.240
[Tammy] ...dropped from that team
because he was fucking shit.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.960
- [Hunter] He fucking tore his ACL,
or some shit, bitch!
- What's going on over there?

30:33.960 --> 30:36.000
[all argue indistinctly]

30:36.000 --> 30:38.400
Oh, yeah, I'm ready. I'm fucking ready.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.880
Hey! Cut it out!

30:39.880 --> 30:41.760
Hey, Mike! Mike!

30:41.760 --> 30:43.400
Cut it out, you two!

30:43.400 --> 30:44.800
You leave those girls alone, alright?

30:44.800 --> 30:46.520
[Dulcie] Hey, Mike,
step away from the teenagers!

30:46.520 --> 30:49.040
- Where are you gonna do?
- [Dulcie] Teenagers,
you step away from each other

30:49.040 --> 30:52.200
and you go somewhere and you...
you do some homework, please.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.000
It's winter holidays, Miss.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.560
Yes, it is, Miranda.

30:55.560 --> 30:58.000
And regardless,
the library's open, so...

30:58.000 --> 31:00.120
- Go have a wank, kids. Go!
- So teenagers, disperse!

31:00.120 --> 31:01.800
- Thank you.
- Fucking homo!

31:01.800 --> 31:03.240
- You watch your mouth.
- [Tammy] Fuck you!

31:03.240 --> 31:04.480
[Dulcie] You mind your manners, son.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.560
- [Hunter] Let's go, C-Dog.
- [Callum] Can you not call me that?

31:06.560 --> 31:08.120
[boy] Don't worry about her.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.200
Well that was a bonus

31:09.200 --> 31:12.600
"unhinged meltdown by a psychopath"
freebie, hey.

31:12.600 --> 31:16.320
John George Haigh dissolved
the bodies of his victims in acid baths.

31:16.320 --> 31:18.760
- Good God.
- Fucking hell, Adele.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.320
Sven.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.320
Sorry, you are stuck where?

31:23.320 --> 31:25.800
I came in to wee an hour ago, at least.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.320
Lucky I had Father Terrence's
screenplay with me.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.800
It's borderline pornographic.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.960
- [Eddie] Nuh, I'm gonna have to ram it.
- [Dulcie] Yep, yep. [sighs]

31:34.960 --> 31:37.000
Oh!

31:37.000 --> 31:38.720
You don't close that toilet door, mate.

31:38.720 --> 31:40.920
If you were a regular
at The Doorbell, you'd know that.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.200
Yeah, I'm not a regular, Ted,

31:42.200 --> 31:45.160
because every time I step in this place
I feel like I'm gonna get hate-crimed.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.360
That's your stuff, mate.
My brother Pete's gay.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.840
- Oh, are you Pete Hopkin's brother?
- [ramming continues]

31:50.840 --> 31:53.800
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God! Send him my love.

31:53.800 --> 31:55.240
Yeah, nah, I will, eh.

31:55.240 --> 31:58.280
OK, alright, thank you Ted.
Off you pop, thanks.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.720
Unless, of course,
you want to help in any way.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.360
Yeah. Nah.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.440
Great. Super-duper.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.000
I'm gonna have to
get my legs involved.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.760
- OK.
- As a battering ram. Hoist me up.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.880
- What? What? What?
- On the count of three,
run towards the door!

32:09.880 --> 32:11.520
- OK, right!
- Ready, stand back, Sven!

32:11.520 --> 32:13.400
Oh, God! You saved me!

32:13.400 --> 32:15.760
- Oh, wow, that kicked back, that did.
- Did it?

32:15.760 --> 32:17.080
What'd I get, your mons pubis?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.520
- Ah...
- Your cooch?

32:18.520 --> 32:20.480
- No, I'm OK. I'm alright.
- You alright? You need a massage?

32:20.480 --> 32:23.080
There's a character in here called
Samantha, right? She runs the local inn.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.760
And like she keeps confessing to
all the naughty stuff she's done.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.920
And then she tries to fellate
the Father Inspector.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.760
Honestly, I just can't put it down.

32:29.760 --> 32:31.840
Jesus Christ, Collins.
Get a load of this.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.960
It's like Gavin and Trent Latham's
teenage diary in here.

32:36.560 --> 32:37.920
"Nugent."

32:39.560 --> 32:41.080
That's Nuggets.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.480
"Sucks cock."

32:42.480 --> 32:45.760
"Mike Nugent is a gay homo!!"

32:45.760 --> 32:47.920
"Mike is a cock muncher."

32:47.920 --> 32:50.000
Did you know he was one of yours?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.920
What were you saying about repression?
Triggers rage, yeah?

32:52.920 --> 32:55.240
- "Mike Nugent is an arse-puncher."
- Well...

32:55.240 --> 32:56.720
- OK well...
- "Mike is a fag."

32:56.720 --> 32:58.200
- Yes, yes, I hear you.
- All slurs.

32:58.200 --> 33:01.640
But toilet graffiti isn't exactly
expert testimony.

33:01.640 --> 33:05.000
And, I mean, even if it's true,
to get very, very dark,

33:05.000 --> 33:07.240
the queer community don't murder,
we get murdered.

33:07.240 --> 33:10.360
Yeah, and who lets that happen?
The cops.

33:10.360 --> 33:13.360
- Sven, you're a cop.
- Yeah, I know.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.800
Never make big life decisions when
you are going through a break up.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.000
Hot tip.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.240
If we are considering Mike
as a suspect,

33:20.240 --> 33:22.400
why didn't his DNA match the blood
from the Loch Nessie?

33:22.400 --> 33:24.840
Didn't we test every man in town?

33:24.840 --> 33:26.800
Yeah, well,
fucking dick-chin at forensics

33:26.800 --> 33:28.080
probably fucked it up, didn't he?

33:28.080 --> 33:30.080
Oh, Mike didn't get DNA tested.

33:32.040 --> 33:33.640
He had to take Nola to the hospital.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.760
I was gonna follow it up with him,

33:34.760 --> 33:38.880
but then you said that the suspect
was a lady, and so I... didn't.

33:38.880 --> 33:41.320
- Good, good, good, good. Great.
- Fuck.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.880
Sorry.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.440
That's a good-looking boat.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.920
- Oi, Collins, what are you looking at?
- Nothing, nothing.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.320
Ah, Hastings, yeah, it's Redcliffe.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.200
Yeah, we've got
a red-hot suspect here, mate.

33:58.200 --> 34:00.600
Yeah, we're gonna need a warrant
to search his property, stat.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.280
[chuckles]

34:25.639 --> 34:28.199
Yes! I got my period!

34:28.199 --> 34:31.159
As I told the detectives,
I am at capacity, yeah?

34:31.159 --> 34:34.320
And I certainly don't have time
to do additional tests for you.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.840
The wood smells like garlic.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.159
It's probably just a souvlaki.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.639
I don't think it's a souvlaki, James,

34:38.639 --> 34:40.080
- I think it's arsine.
- Well, it is.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.560
Please, all I'm asking you to do
are a few quick chem tests

34:42.560 --> 34:43.920
so I can confirm this.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.800
Please, they're really quick and simple.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.800
Oh, yes, I'm aware that
they're simple, Abby.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.639
Look, I know that you decided to
quit forensic science

34:50.639 --> 34:52.159
after what, one semester?

34:52.159 --> 34:55.880
I quit so our relationship didn't
jeopardise your teaching position.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.000
Babe, come on.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.840
That final exam was a hot mess. [laughs]

34:59.840 --> 35:01.920
I know it was because I marked it.

35:01.920 --> 35:05.680
Point is, I know you don’t really get
what it is that I do here

35:05.680 --> 35:07.800
but, trust me, your little chem tests
are high school stuff.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.280
High school stuff?

35:09.280 --> 35:12.640
Oh hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't worry, I'm not insulted.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.640
This just isn't
your world babe, alright?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.040
Let's crack open the Riesling

35:17.040 --> 35:19.120
and get this barefoot
date night started.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.600
Now, your charity spending.

35:20.600 --> 35:23.160
You've got two sponsor kids.
Can we get rid of one?

35:23.160 --> 35:25.840
I have to go back to work.
The detectives need me.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.320
Fine. Wow, fine.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.800
- I'll just fertilise
our financial future alone, then!
- [door shuts]

35:33.800 --> 35:35.760
[Tammy] I can't believe
Tom's ditched us.

35:35.760 --> 35:38.880
I made him an honorary member
of the Pademelons.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.680
[Miranda] You said he could
hold your water bottle.

35:40.680 --> 35:43.440
Yeah, pretty fucking prestigious,
if you ask me.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.000
What do you think?

35:47.000 --> 35:50.560
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

35:50.560 --> 35:52.800
Yeah, shit-brown's a good colour
on you, sis.

35:52.800 --> 35:53.880
Oh, fuck off.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.200
Tammy, I just found
your sports drink graveyard

35:56.200 --> 35:58.640
behind Aunty Joy's
knitting basket, look.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.640
[clears throat]

36:01.640 --> 36:04.160
- Oh, wow.
- What do you think, Aunty?

36:04.160 --> 36:05.960
It's very brown.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.160
Look at how much this cost!

36:08.160 --> 36:11.640
You could buy uniforms
for a whole footy team with that!

36:11.640 --> 36:14.120
I should ask Margaret
to sponsor the Pademelons, eh!

36:14.120 --> 36:16.200
- [laugh]
- What? What are you laughing at?

36:16.200 --> 36:18.440
Remember when we had that sit-down
with Margaret and her brother,

36:18.440 --> 36:20.040
asking to gain access to the island?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.520
- What? What island?
- Island? What island?

36:21.520 --> 36:24.080
- I don't know anything about an island.
- Do you know anything about an island?

36:24.080 --> 36:25.320
Mm, smartarses.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.960
Yeah, so, Aunty Joy and I
wanted to go collect ochre,

36:27.960 --> 36:29.360
and they were all like...

36:29.360 --> 36:31.640
[mimics Margaret] "Yes darling.
Of course you can, darling.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.360
"It's a darling idea, darling."

36:34.360 --> 36:36.160
And then a week later,
they pulled the pin.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.320
Well, if you used that voice,
it's no wonder, Mum.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.080
No, they pulled the pin
because that brother, William,

36:42.080 --> 36:44.040
got cold feet
and then took off overseas.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.640
But couldn't Margaret just grant access?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.160
She said her hands
were tied, apparently,

36:47.160 --> 36:49.440
without her brother's permission.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.960
Point is,

36:50.960 --> 36:53.280
if there's nothing in it for that
family, they won't help,

36:53.280 --> 36:55.360
- because they're a bunch of snakes.
- [both] Snakes.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.800
[Tammy] Yeah, but this is different.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.600
Like, no offence, Mum,
but I'm heaps more charming than you.

36:59.600 --> 37:00.800
[stifles laugh]

37:08.560 --> 37:10.920
[Eddie] Has Hastings
sent the warrant yet?

37:10.920 --> 37:13.320
Can you... Why are you...
Can you not be so close?

37:13.320 --> 37:16.080
- Just give me a bit of space, please!
- Fine, fine.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.920
I feel sick about this.

37:19.920 --> 37:21.400
Mike's a nice person.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.880
I don't care if he's your bloody
best mate, mate, OK?

37:23.880 --> 37:26.360
He strung Jimmy up on that cross
like a fucking salami.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.080
- [phone buzzes]
- Answer it. Is it Hastings?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.800
Cath, love, you OK?

37:30.800 --> 37:32.600
No, I'm freaking out.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.800
There's eight plastic owls
staring at me from the balcony

37:34.800 --> 37:36.640
and I can't stop thinking about Jimmy.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.760
I just saw him two days ago, when he
was masturbating in front of me...

37:40.760 --> 37:44.080
Oh, love, I'm really...
I'm sorry I'm not there with you.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.800
OK, I'm going to go
see Skye and Nadiyah.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.600
I'm gonna eat 300 oysters.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.600
Do you want some? Ask Eddie.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.600
- No...
- Ah, no fucking way, Cath.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.400
They are the cum of the sea, mate.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.320
Hey, Eddie, I bought you an owl.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.360
Now sexy, I spoke to
Elaine and Rachel.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.040
Told them that the wheels are in motion
to make an offer on the hobby farm.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.520
Ah, ah, no. Cath, can we...

38:02.520 --> 38:03.760
- [phone dings]
- Shit! Hastings!

38:03.760 --> 38:05.080
Can we... OK, alright.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.520
- Can we just...
- The warrant's in!

38:06.520 --> 38:09.400
...put everything on pause
until I'm properly back on board?

38:09.400 --> 38:11.760
Dulce, it's next to
Mount Mountain National Park.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.200
There's a glow-worm trail.

38:13.200 --> 38:17.000
OK, well, I... I mean, yes,
there are glow-worms there but I...

38:17.000 --> 38:18.520
I think we should act now.

38:18.520 --> 38:20.160
If there's one silver lining
about these murders,

38:20.160 --> 38:21.960
it's the drop in property prices.

38:21.960 --> 38:26.360
OK, yep. Yep.
Cath, I do have to go. Can, um...

38:26.360 --> 38:27.840
Can I...

38:27.840 --> 38:29.440
Yes, I will pass that along.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.960
- Cath loves you.
- Yeah, got it. Let's go.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.040
Alright, bye. Bye.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.800
- God, I can open my own door,
Detective!
- I didn't expect you to talk so much.

38:34.800 --> 38:36.360
- I can answer a phone.
- Come on, guys, let's go.

38:37.640 --> 38:39.160
- Please.
- [sighs]

38:41.440 --> 38:42.600
[knocking]

38:42.600 --> 38:45.200
[Eddie] Open up! We have
a warrant to search the premises.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.440
Right, we're coming in.

Where were you, the night
your Under-16s footy coach Sam O'Dwyer

40:06.360 --> 40:08.040
was killed?

40:08.040 --> 40:09.800
June 10th, 2017.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.640
Ah... I don't know. I'm sorry.

40:13.640 --> 40:15.640
Why don't you know?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.600
Because it was five years ago.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.440
Do you know what
you were doing five years ago?

40:19.440 --> 40:21.200
Well, given it was a Saturday night,

40:21.200 --> 40:23.760
I'm 90% sure I was getting railed
up against a Land Cruiser

40:23.760 --> 40:25.800
in the Humpty Doo pub carpark.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.200
But this is about you, mate.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.880
Ah, OK.

40:29.880 --> 40:32.600
If it was a Saturday,
I was probably working.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.960
Doing highway patrol.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.440
I always worked Saturdays,

40:35.440 --> 40:37.360
because Sergeant Buckley
was usually inebriated.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.160
Sven, can you verify that?

40:39.160 --> 40:40.440
Oh, yeah, that's true.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.160
I'm still finding empty whisky bottles
hidden around the office.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.320
Th... The alibi, Sven.
Verify the alibi.

40:45.320 --> 40:47.880
Oh, OK, yep. Yep. I'll just...

40:49.360 --> 40:52.680
How well did you know the victims,
Mr Nuggets?

40:52.680 --> 40:54.200
I grew up with them.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.200
You know, I don't think I've
fully processed that they've all gone.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.000
They were such super-ripper blokes.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.160
Mike...

41:04.560 --> 41:05.960
Are you making sandwiches, mate?

41:05.960 --> 41:08.120
Because you are adding a lot of mayo

41:08.120 --> 41:10.520
to your relationships with those blokes.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.760
No, no, I'm not.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.760
The way you reacted to
those teenage boys this morning...

41:14.760 --> 41:17.960
Maybe they reminded you of
how Gavin and Trent used to bully you.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.200
They didn't bully me.

41:19.200 --> 41:21.600
Well there's a wall of graffiti
in the Doorbell bog

41:21.600 --> 41:23.080
that suggests otherwise.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.920
Mike, is there anything
that you need to tell us?

41:24.920 --> 41:26.200
No.

41:26.200 --> 41:29.400
Mate, we've been to your house.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.840
We know what you're hiding
in your cupboard.

41:47.160 --> 41:48.160
OK.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.920
This is who I am

41:53.920 --> 41:56.320
and doing it makes me happy.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.280
[Eddie] Yeah, I'm sure it does.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.840
- I know people don't approve.
- Yeah, no, they don't get it, do they?

42:00.840 --> 42:02.320
But I'm not hurting anyone.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.680
Oh, well, I mean, you are.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.160
I know what society thinks
about men that wear dresses,

42:06.160 --> 42:08.000
but it doesn't make me a murderer.

42:09.200 --> 42:10.800
- What?
- Sorry?

42:10.800 --> 42:13.120
My dresses, at my house?

42:13.120 --> 42:15.920
That's why I'm here, isn't it? Because
you think I'm some sort of pervert?

42:15.920 --> 42:16.960
- [Dulcie] No!
- Oh, my God!

42:16.960 --> 42:19.160
- Is that what this is about,
Detectives?
- [Eddie] Ah, no, that's...

42:19.160 --> 42:20.920
You are "Silence Of The Lambs"-ing Mike!

42:20.920 --> 42:22.520
- Dulcie!
- No! No, we are not!

42:22.520 --> 42:24.880
[Sven] Gender non-conformity
does not equal deviancy.

42:24.880 --> 42:27.960
- That film was a hate crime.
- Harry Styles wears dresses.

42:27.960 --> 42:29.320
- Harry Styles.
- OK.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.880
- Who the fuck is Harry Styles?

42:30.880 --> 42:32.440
- Oh, my God.
- What the heck is going on?

42:32.440 --> 42:34.200
- No, no, no...
- No, Michelle, you cannot be in here.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.280
They told me you were here.

42:35.280 --> 42:37.480
They think I'm the serial killer,
Mish! This is bullshit!

42:37.480 --> 42:39.400
- Is this because of his dresses?
- [both] No!

42:39.400 --> 42:43.320
Because anyone can wear dresses!
It doesn't make him a perve.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.400
- Harry Styles wears dresses.
- That's what I said.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.640
- There has been...
- Harry Styles.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.440
- Who the fuck is Harry Styles?
- I will tell you later.

42:48.440 --> 42:51.440
Those footy blokes caught him once,
in flipping 1998

42:51.440 --> 42:52.680
wearing my formal dress,

42:52.680 --> 42:54.360
and since then,
they made Mike's life hell,

42:54.360 --> 42:56.400
because they thought he was gay,
and a girl.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.640
- How tedious!
- I know, right?

42:58.640 --> 43:00.160
- Who cares if he was?
- Who cares!

43:00.160 --> 43:02.160
And what kind of sad grump
doesn't want to wear sequins?

43:02.160 --> 43:03.680
Actually, what happened to
that dress, Mish?

43:03.680 --> 43:05.560
- My tits got too big for it.
- Oh, my goodness.

43:05.560 --> 43:08.560
My best friend has hid himself for years
because of those bullies.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.600
Alright, he has lost
a lifetime of joy to it,

43:11.600 --> 43:15.280
and now he is not going to shrink
and be less magnificent than he is

43:15.280 --> 43:16.680
because of your closed minds.

43:16.680 --> 43:18.160
[Eddie] Listen, listen! OK.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.320
Look, I don't give a shit
if he wears dresses, alright?

43:20.320 --> 43:22.280
As long as I don't have to
fucking wear them.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.640
- [Michelle] Good.
- I don't want to see that.

43:24.640 --> 43:26.120
- Good.
- Good.

43:26.120 --> 43:28.440
- Good. Great.
- Good.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.800
'Cause the first time I saw
Mikey in a dress, he was so beautiful.

43:31.800 --> 43:35.000
He still is. He's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.920
Same, Mish. You're the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.120
Same!

43:41.120 --> 43:43.800
I love you, Mikey.
I have since we were kids.

43:43.800 --> 43:45.480
I just thought you saw me like a sister.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.560
- Same, except a brother.
- OK, what's happening? This is...

43:47.560 --> 43:51.080
Mish, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

43:51.080 --> 43:55.000
- Yeah, OK. Same!
- Same.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.840
- No, no.
- OK. Alright.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.040
This is... No, that doesn't...

43:58.040 --> 44:00.680
- OK. Hello!
- No, this is not...

44:00.680 --> 44:02.080
- Oi! Hello! Stop!
- Mike! Mike!

44:02.080 --> 44:04.560
- Mike! Hey!
- Mike! Mike! Stop!

44:04.560 --> 44:06.960
This does not change the fact

44:06.960 --> 44:10.800
that you had a controlled substance
sitting next to your toothpaste.

44:10.800 --> 44:13.320
- Yes, pentofarti...
- Pentobarbital.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.480
- ...b... bar... barbital.
- Barbital.

44:15.480 --> 44:17.440
That's Mum assisted dying kit, OK?

44:17.440 --> 44:19.200
She bought that, like, 10 years ago
off the internet

44:19.200 --> 44:21.120
when she was first diagnosed.
It's nothing.

44:21.120 --> 44:23.560
- Come on, mate.
- No! [stammers] It is, it's true.

44:23.560 --> 44:26.440
Check the expiry date.
It's never been used.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.920
Mum's still alive, isn't she?

44:29.040 --> 44:30.240
Wait, isn't she?

44:30.240 --> 44:31.600
Yeah, she's with Claire. She's fine.

44:31.600 --> 44:33.280
[relieved laughter]

44:33.280 --> 44:36.400
- Oh, my God, Mish.
- Oh, Mikey!

44:36.400 --> 44:38.680
[kissing]

44:42.120 --> 44:44.160
You're 24.
You're not gonna get detention.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.440
OK, thank you, Sharelle.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.720
- I really appreciate you helping me.
- Fuck me dead.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.680
I'm helping the nerd, not the cop.

44:53.520 --> 44:57.360
[Sven] Ah, Mike's alibi for the night
that Sam died checks out, FYI.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.120
Here's a list of everyone
he pulled over.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.080
37 DUI's, 12 speeding fines,

45:01.080 --> 45:04.440
and one person driving with
a dead wallaby stuck to the windshield.

45:04.440 --> 45:05.480
Random.

45:05.480 --> 45:08.120
Total of 51 people
who can verify Mike's whereabouts.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.840
- Mike is not our killer.
- Fuck! Fuck!

45:11.840 --> 45:13.440
Fuck.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.040
How long have we got
to get another suspect for Hastings?

45:16.040 --> 45:18.360
- Oh, about two hours.
- Fuck!

45:18.360 --> 45:19.960
Oh, and Steve called.

45:19.960 --> 45:22.280
He said he couldn't find
Sam O'Dwyer's sloop.

45:22.280 --> 45:24.680
- I told him it didn't need to be a...
- Of course he couldn't find the sloop.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.600
It's in fucking bits in
the fucking Forensic lock-up.

45:26.600 --> 45:27.640
- Fuck.
- [phone buzzes]

45:27.640 --> 45:28.880
Just passing on a message.

45:30.680 --> 45:33.280
Ah, Sven, what is all this stuff
on my desk?

45:33.280 --> 45:35.240
Oh, that was just
sitting at the info booth

45:35.240 --> 45:37.120
when I got back from my loo odyssey.

45:40.520 --> 45:41.520
Hi, Cath.

45:41.520 --> 45:44.320
[shakily] Sexy, you have to help me.
Come quick!

45:49.920 --> 45:52.320
- You still getting married?
- Yes.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.960
I've choosed my choices, Sharelle,

45:55.960 --> 45:59.320
and now I'm going through
with the choices I've choosed.

45:59.320 --> 46:00.680
Cool.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.040
Smart move, sis.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.520
OK, you literally had a child
with Gavin Latham,

46:06.520 --> 46:09.400
who once got stuck in a rabbit hutch
during a break-and-enter.

46:09.400 --> 46:11.160
Fuck up, cop.
Go build your bomb.

46:11.160 --> 46:12.840
Go vacuum a rec room.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.920
[groaning]

46:32.920 --> 46:35.320
Just drive a little bit more carefully.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.680
- Put your belt on, Cath.
- No.

46:38.680 --> 46:40.200
Cath, put your belt on.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.640
Stop yelling at me!

46:43.920 --> 46:47.640
This serial killer stuff is
happening to me too, Dulcie.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.040
Skye just fed me so many oysters.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.480
- Yeah, yeah, I can smell that.
- They're banked up in me like cars.

46:54.480 --> 46:56.840
- Ugh...
- No. No, no, no!

46:56.840 --> 46:58.400
Not in here, Cath.

46:58.400 --> 47:00.760
Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

47:01.760 --> 47:04.360
[groans]

47:04.360 --> 47:07.280
[retches]

47:07.280 --> 47:10.200
Ugh... [tearfully] Sorry, sexy!

47:10.200 --> 47:12.280
Two hours until Hastings replaces us

47:12.280 --> 47:13.960
with a couple of dick swingers,

47:13.960 --> 47:16.600
and she's out picking up
some fucking hours

47:16.600 --> 47:18.760
as Deadloch's only Uber driver.

47:18.760 --> 47:20.160
Sveg, why is this still out?

47:20.160 --> 47:22.080
We're giving it back to Vanessa.

47:27.520 --> 47:29.800
Where's Nugget's list?

47:29.800 --> 47:31.320
- What list?
- The, um...

47:31.320 --> 47:33.520
The traffic cop list.
Nugget... Nugget's list.

47:33.520 --> 47:35.120
You threw it on the ground.

47:44.120 --> 47:45.960
Sveg, where did Nuggets go?

47:45.960 --> 47:48.400
Ah, he and Michelle went out
for celebratory surf 'n' turf.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.640
Shit!

47:49.640 --> 47:52.120
Inspector Father plays the saxophone!

47:53.360 --> 47:54.800
That's a shame.

47:55.800 --> 47:56.920
Detective!

47:56.920 --> 47:58.960
Oh, fuck. Not now, Ray Pies.
I'm working.

47:58.960 --> 48:00.320
We can fuck later, OK? Later.

48:00.320 --> 48:02.640
Although, obviously, that shit
you're suggesting there, that's off.

48:02.640 --> 48:04.040
Oh, no, I'm not... Wait!

48:04.040 --> 48:07.560
Eddie, Detective, this is Lou,
my donkey. I'm just walking her.

48:07.560 --> 48:09.160
She's 32. She's really old.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.440
For a donkey, not for a human...

48:10.440 --> 48:12.320
Look, stop talking, OK? I'm busy.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.120
I'll be around later on,
if you're around.

48:14.120 --> 48:17.240
Just leave your fucking
horse-themed pet at home.

48:17.240 --> 48:19.000
OK, cool. Is that like a date?

48:20.040 --> 48:21.040
What?

48:22.400 --> 48:23.400
A date?

48:25.040 --> 48:26.560
I don't have a date box, OK?

48:26.560 --> 48:28.000
I have a fuck box.

48:28.000 --> 48:31.200
And, currently, for a limited time only,
you're in it, so...

48:31.200 --> 48:33.080
I don't want to be in your fuck box.

48:33.080 --> 48:37.680
Well, no, I do, but I also want to be
in your other box

48:37.680 --> 48:41.440
that includes dates, chats, things,
if that suits you.

48:41.440 --> 48:42.720
I'm going.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.480
Dates with chats? Fucking rotten shit!

48:46.480 --> 48:49.720
- OK, Lou, let's go.
- Where's the fucking Doorbell?

48:49.720 --> 48:53.080
You know that thing
that you did the other night?

48:53.080 --> 48:55.280
The finger thing.
We have to do the finger thing...

48:55.280 --> 48:56.960
OK, alright.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.600
Oh, Jesus! What is that? Is that...

48:59.600 --> 49:01.280
Surprise!

49:01.280 --> 49:03.720
Meet our new baby.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.920
Elaine and Rachel gave her to us.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.280
No, Cath, no,
we didn't agree to a new dog.

49:08.280 --> 49:12.160
She has anxiety
and overactive anal glands.

49:12.160 --> 49:14.080
Oh, well, that's...
that's a bonus, isn't it?

49:14.080 --> 49:16.600
Oh, isn't she adorable?

49:16.600 --> 49:19.040
Cath, go to bed.
I have to get back to work.

49:19.040 --> 49:23.560
Stop being so mean to me.
I have had a terrible day.

49:23.560 --> 49:25.800
You were rude to me in the car.

49:25.800 --> 49:28.240
Fern ate her waistcoat.

49:28.240 --> 49:30.600
And there's a killer on the loose.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.760
Hello?

49:32.760 --> 49:36.440
Skye was in a mood tonight.
She and Nadiyah are fighting.

49:36.440 --> 49:38.680
They're sleeping in separate rooms,

49:38.680 --> 49:43.720
and Skye went and spent
all of their IVF money, $12,000,

49:43.720 --> 49:46.240
on something that she won't even say.

49:46.240 --> 49:50.200
She didn't even mention Nadiyah
in that tribune article.

49:51.640 --> 49:53.080
They're gonna break up.

49:57.920 --> 50:02.040
Come and cuddle me, sexy, I'm sad!

50:02.040 --> 50:03.560
I'm scared!

50:13.560 --> 50:15.320
Hey, hey, where's your Mr Nuggets?

50:15.320 --> 50:16.440
- Loo.
- OK.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.520
Nuggets?

50:21.440 --> 50:23.560
Nuggets! Fuck.

50:23.560 --> 50:24.720
Shit!

50:24.720 --> 50:26.440
Who is this,
who you gave a ticket to?

50:26.440 --> 50:28.320
- Uh, what?
- Number 27 on the list.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.160
The initials. What do they stand for?
Who is it?

50:31.160 --> 50:33.240
Uh... [mumbles]

50:35.240 --> 50:37.440
Oh, fuck my arse!

50:37.440 --> 50:39.040
Ah, fuck!

50:39.040 --> 50:40.280
I know who it is.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.520
Dulce. Dulce, you have to read this.
It's a masterpiece.

50:44.520 --> 50:46.360
Sven, who dropped this off?

50:46.360 --> 50:47.680
[Sven] The bag of chains?

50:47.680 --> 50:50.440
I told you, it just appeared
when I was imprisoned in the toilet.

50:50.440 --> 50:53.840
Uh, did they leave a note,
or any details at all?

50:53.840 --> 50:57.040
No, they didn't. Ooh, look out.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.240
Samantha O'Fryer's
having another affair.

51:06.480 --> 51:10.080
Fucking bullshit!
Fucking arse-fucking fuck!

51:12.120 --> 51:14.960
I knew it!
I knew it wasn't a souvlaki.

51:14.960 --> 51:17.680
Oh, no. Sharelle!

51:17.680 --> 51:18.760
[thud]

51:25.400 --> 51:27.880
- You ready?
- Do you have my money?

51:27.880 --> 51:28.880
Of course.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.680
Then you friggin bet I am, Megan.

51:35.680 --> 51:37.560
OK, in this scene she tells the priest

51:37.560 --> 51:40.280
that she was sprung by her husband
and her teenage son, right?

51:40.280 --> 51:41.840
The sixteen-year-old, Sly,

51:41.840 --> 51:43.760
walked in on Samantha
banging some random dude.

51:43.760 --> 51:48.240
Their names are
Samantha, Rick and Sly O'Fryer?

51:48.240 --> 51:49.760
Yep.

51:49.760 --> 51:53.160
[Sven] Samantha O'Fryer...

51:53.160 --> 51:54.400
Sam O'Dwyer.

51:54.400 --> 51:56.240
Oh, my God.

51:56.240 --> 51:58.480
She knew about the infidelities.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.520
The women of the town
hate the men, don't they?

52:01.520 --> 52:03.680
And she hates them the most.

52:03.680 --> 52:05.080
She always has.

52:05.080 --> 52:08.320
She hated Trent, she hated Gavin

52:08.320 --> 52:12.080
she hated Rod,
and she hated Sam the most of all.

52:12.080 --> 52:14.280
She's a man-hater.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.520
Sorry, babe, who hated all these men?

52:19.080 --> 52:21.920
You clocked that graffiti
on the Doorbell bog, didn't you?

52:21.920 --> 52:25.800
Those fuckholes weren't just
bullying Mike, were they?

52:25.800 --> 52:27.600
How long have you been sitting on this?

52:27.600 --> 52:28.840
I... I...

52:28.840 --> 52:31.840
Look, I didn't think that I was right,
and you were onto Mike, so...

52:31.840 --> 52:34.960
Oh, oh, you didn't think you were right
or you didn't want to be right?

52:34.960 --> 52:36.960
You said yourself,
sometimes doing the hard thing

52:36.960 --> 52:38.920
means upsetting
the people you care about.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.720
Yes, but not everything adds up, so...

52:41.720 --> 52:43.880
Number 27 on the list.

52:43.880 --> 52:46.280
The night Sam died.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.480
Mike gave her a speeding ticket.

52:55.120 --> 52:56.600
[sighs]

52:56.600 --> 52:59.840
Skye friggin O'Dwyer.

53:00.840 --> 53:03.280
[Eddie] She was in Deadloch
the night her Dad was murdered.

53:04.800 --> 53:06.120
She lied.

53:10.080 --> 53:11.440
Bum.

53:11.440 --> 53:12.480
Yeah.

53:13.560 --> 53:14.560
Big bum.
