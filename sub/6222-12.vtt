00:01.752 --> 00:05.006
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.089 --> 00:10.178
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.261 --> 00:13.181
His name, Merlin.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.630
It was Cenred who did this,
you're certain of it?

00:45.713 --> 00:47.089
Yes, my lord.

00:47.173 --> 00:50.343
His messenger has only
this minute departed Camelot.

00:50.426 --> 00:53.763
Cenred said that the patrol
trespassed on his land.

00:54.305 --> 00:56.390
And an example had to be made.

00:56.474 --> 00:57.975
How many dead?

01:01.145 --> 01:04.232
All of them, sire. Every last man.

01:05.566 --> 01:06.609
The Knights?

01:07.860 --> 01:09.153
All lost.

01:10.613 --> 01:13.866
Edric, Oldof, Osric.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.328
And Sir Leon.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.013
Here!

01:48.401 --> 01:50.152
Quick. Help me.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.197
We do not have much time. Ready?

02:00.830 --> 02:03.249
His spirit leaves him. We must hurry.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.211
(MEN CHANTING)

02:40.745 --> 02:41.996
Welcome back.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.912
-We thought you were dead for sure.
-I was dead.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.748
Or as good as.
Until the Druids found me.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.084
The Druids?

03:29.919 --> 03:31.379
LEON: Yes, my lord.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.506
| owe them my life.

03:34.632 --> 03:37.802
How did they heal you?
You were as good as dead you said.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.012
- Don't know.
-Did they use magic?

03:41.305 --> 03:42.348
Well, I...

03:42.431 --> 03:44.183
Yes or no?
It's a simple enough question.

03:45.142 --> 03:48.604
| only know that I drank
from some kind of cup, sire.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.814
Cup?

03:50.523 --> 03:52.483
It was extraordinary, my lord.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.029
| have known nothing like it.

03:57.113 --> 04:01.033
From the moment it touched my lips
| could feel my life return to me.

04:09.875 --> 04:11.001
Well,

04:11.836 --> 04:14.672
your trials have left you weary,
I'm sure.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.923
We must let him rest.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.353
-Is that it?
-That's it.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.648
He is exhausted, sire,
and severely dehydrated.

04:32.731 --> 04:35.192
But given time he'll make
a full recovery.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.986
Thank you, Gaius.

04:46.704 --> 04:47.830
Well?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.624
It's remarkable, sire.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.960
He bears no sign of any kind of wound.

04:53.043 --> 04:56.380
-He is in perfect health.
-And the cup he spoke of?

04:56.464 --> 05:00.968
From his description,
| would say it was the Cup of Life.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.434
-You are aware of its power, Gaius?
-I am indeed, sire.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.978
But the Druids are a peaceful people.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.980
They would only ever use
the Cup for good.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.484
-Sir Leon is surely proof of that.
-Be that as it may.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.736
According to Sir Leon's description,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.864
the Druid's cave lies within
Cenred's kingdom.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.658
It is imperative that we get
to the Cup before he does.

05:24.742 --> 05:27.620
My lord, the Druids are secretive
by nature.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.788
They will have the Cup well hidden.

05:29.872 --> 05:31.999
Might it not be wise
to leave it where it is?

05:32.082 --> 05:34.251
| am not prepared to take that risk.

05:43.761 --> 05:45.888
| thought the Cup was
destroyed with Nimueh

05:45.971 --> 05:48.182
when I defeated her
on the Isle of the Blessed.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.100
The Cup cannot be destroyed.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.145
It's magic is eternal,
unbound by time or place.

05:53.229 --> 05:54.688
But why does Uther fear it so much?

05:54.772 --> 05:57.858
Because the Cup can be used
for evil as well as good.

05:57.942 --> 06:00.861
-I don't understand.
-Many centuries ago,

06:00.945 --> 06:04.156
it fell into the possession
of a great warlord.

06:04.532 --> 06:07.451
One night,
he gathered his army before him.

06:07.952 --> 06:11.205
He took a drop of blood
from each and every man

06:11.288 --> 06:13.541
and collected it in the Cup.

06:13.707 --> 06:17.253
Such was the vessel's power
that the soldiers

06:17.336 --> 06:19.505
were made immortal where they stood.

06:20.673 --> 06:21.840
So they could not be killed.

06:21.924 --> 06:26.011
The carnage they wrought
was beyond all imagining.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.223
The King's no fool.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.433
He knows that the forces
of the Old Religion

06:31.517 --> 06:33.561
are rising against him once more.

06:33.644 --> 06:38.315
Heaven forbid that the Cup should
fall into the hands of Morgause.

06:38.691 --> 06:39.858
Or Morgana.

06:39.942 --> 06:44.822
With such a weapon at their disposal,
Camelot would be all but lost.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.248
-You called for me, father.
-Cenred is our sworn enemy.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.084
We cannot risk him getting his hands
on the Cup of Life.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.878
-I know, Father.
-You must retrieve it.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.090
Your mission must remain secret.
You can speak to no one of this.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.010
ARTHUR: I will take only my most
trusted men.

07:06.135 --> 07:09.263
UTHER: We've seen what happened to the
last patrol that entered Cenred's land.

07:10.431 --> 07:11.724
You must go alone.

07:13.142 --> 07:14.893
| am sorry to place
such a burden upon you,

07:14.977 --> 07:17.187
but there is no one else I can trust.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.691
| understand, Father.

07:30.868 --> 07:32.828
You will be ready by sunrise,
won't you, Merlin?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.122
| don't know where we're going,
how do I know what to pack?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.333
Will it be hot? Will it be cold?
Will it be wet? Will it be dry?

07:37.416 --> 07:40.711
Don't be such a girl, Merlin.
We're not going on holiday.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.172
Holiday? What's a holiday?

07:44.923 --> 07:46.133
Not that.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.677
Nothing bearing the crest of Camelot.
We're going under cover.

07:48.761 --> 07:51.680
This is ridiculous. Are you going
to tell me where we're going or not?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.351
-I can tell you it will be dangerous.
-Great.

07:55.434 --> 07:58.187
And I can tell you we will be traveling
through bandit infested lands.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.814
-Terrific. Then where?
-I can't tell you that.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.399
You don't know where we're going.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.819
No, Merlin. I know where we're going.
It's just I can't tell you, that's all.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.906
Right, 'cause if you do,
you'll have to kill me, I suppose.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.742
Immediately and without hesitation.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.079
Great.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.209
It'll be a surprise. I love surprises.
Who doesn't love a good surprise?

08:24.421 --> 08:25.964
(DOG BARKING)

08:46.527 --> 08:48.612
What is it you wanted
to tell me, Sister?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.364
Arthur rides at dawn.

08:50.823 --> 08:53.826
He's been sent to recover
some kind of cup.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.120
The Cup of Life, they called it?

08:56.203 --> 08:58.622
The Cup of Life? Are you sure?

08:58.706 --> 09:00.124
| heard every word.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.169
How long I have searched for it.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.257
Is it as powerful as they believe?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.676
Oh, yes.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.803
Trust me, Sister,

09:12.928 --> 09:16.890
with the Cup in our possession,
Camelot would soon be at our mercy.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.475
Where is the Cup now?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.102
It's in the hands of the Druids.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.105
All I know is that their camp lies
within Cenred's kingdom.

09:24.648 --> 09:27.735
Then perhaps Cenred will be of use
to us again.

09:27.818 --> 09:31.113
He has spies everywhere.
If he can have Arthur followed...

09:31.196 --> 09:33.991
Then Arthur will lead us all the way
to the Cup itself.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.827
(CHUCKLES)

10:07.941 --> 10:09.777
Which way was the Prince heading?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.653
For the Forest of Ascetir, my lady.

10:11.737 --> 10:15.407
Send word to the scouts in the area.
They must be prepared.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.909
Yes, sire.

10:19.036 --> 10:21.038
Can your scouts be relied upon?

10:21.163 --> 10:23.957
Of course. I handpicked them myself.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.126
Why does that not reassure me?

10:26.210 --> 10:28.712
Do not concern yourself, my lady.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.381
The Cup of Life will soon be
in our hands.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.718
And when it is, Camelot will be ours.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.805
You forget yourself, Cenred.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.474
It is Morgana that will take the throne,
not you or.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.018
| make no claim upon the throne,

10:43.602 --> 10:45.562
only the spoils of victory.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.566
You will get what you deserve, Cenred.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.194
| can assure you of that.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.662
We're going to Cenred's Kingdom,
aren't we?

11:01.745 --> 11:02.955
What makes you say that?

11:03.080 --> 11:06.208
Er, we're in the Forest of Ascetir,
we're not stopping.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.168
You can think what you like, Merlin.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.587
Oh, come on, you might as well tell me.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.923
Then I'd have to kill you.
| told you that.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.842
Go ahead. I mean,
I'm probably going to die any way.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.177
Look at what happened to the patrol
that came here!

11:17.261 --> 11:19.179
Dead, the lot of them!

11:19.680 --> 11:21.431
Sir Leon survived.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.978
Right, so that gives me, what?
A one in forty chance of making it?

11:26.061 --> 11:28.438
Rather less, actually.
There are only two of us.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.400
So I'm not probably going to die,
I'm definitely going to die.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.068
Always the pessimist, Merlin.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.696
Who knows, maybe just this once
we'll have no trouble.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.073
Maybe you're right.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.784
If past experience is anything to go by.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.511
What was that you were saying
about me being a pessimist?

11:59.595 --> 12:01.471
Must have slipped my mind.

12:06.435 --> 12:07.853
Touch me again, you die.

12:07.936 --> 12:10.522
-Gwaine?
-No manners you royals.

12:10.606 --> 12:12.900
Merlin, old friend, you look terrible.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.943
-Likewise.
-What are you doing here?

12:15.027 --> 12:17.821
You know, wrong place, wrong time,
wrong drink.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.574
-Nothing's changed there, then.
-That's just unfair.

12:21.158 --> 12:22.451
Where exactly are we?

12:22.534 --> 12:24.077

12:24.161 --> 12:26.330
Belongs to a fellow names Jarl.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.708
-Never heard of him.
-Lovely bloke. Slave trader.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.710
We're going to be sold as slaves?

12:31.793 --> 12:34.838
Right, you filthy vermin.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.925
Which one of you is ready to face
my champion in the arena?

12:39.301 --> 12:40.844
No volunteers?

12:41.637 --> 12:45.390
Well, I shall have to choose
one of you toerags myself, then.

12:45.474 --> 12:47.184
Let me see.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.146
How about you!

12:55.192 --> 12:57.945
-Me?
-Death or glory, boy.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.488
You should be honored.

13:01.031 --> 13:03.200
Who is this so-called champion?

13:03.283 --> 13:05.577
Can he crush nothing
but weaklings like this?

13:07.162 --> 13:09.498
You think you could offer
a better contest?

13:11.375 --> 13:12.459
| guarantee it.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.086
Arthur, no.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.545
JARL: Very well.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.673
But if you lose,

13:18.507 --> 13:22.636
I'll feed your little friend
to the crows, piece by stinking piece.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.724
Are you ready, my champion?

13:28.392 --> 13:29.559
| am.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.151
How could you let this happen?

13:38.235 --> 13:40.237
You let Arthur slip
through your fingers.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.823
He was taken before my men
could get to him.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.950
Taken?

13:45.701 --> 13:47.119
By whom, exactly?

13:47.202 --> 13:48.620

-And you let him?
-We have an understanding.

-And where is this Jarl now?
-Don't worry, Morgause,

16:40.041 --> 16:43.879
You must have done something
to end up in a hole like that.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.258
Actually, we're on a quest.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.094
We're looking for the Cup of Life.

16:52.804 --> 16:54.472
-Ow.
-What?

16:54.598 --> 16:57.058
What part of the word "secret"
did you not understand?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.186
It's Gwaine.

16:59.811 --> 17:02.105
GWAINE: Gentlemen. Gentlemen!

17:02.606 --> 17:05.525
It seems whatever it is
that you're after,

17:06.026 --> 17:08.236
you could use a little help.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.617
No one makes a fool of Jarl.

17:15.452 --> 17:16.703
No one.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.539
| want to know who they are

17:19.623 --> 17:22.334
-and where they're hiding!
-My lord...

17:24.920 --> 17:26.003
What's that?

17:26.087 --> 17:28.632
It was confiscated from the prisoners,
my lord.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.717
It may hold some clues.

17:31.134 --> 17:32.928
| don't want clues.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.471
| want blood!

17:41.519 --> 17:42.896
-(YELLS)
-(CLINKING)

18:05.627 --> 18:07.337
Well, well, well.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.674
It seems we were entertaining royalty.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.968
(LAUGHING)

18:16.012 --> 18:19.599
So according to Merlin, here,
if you tell me where this Cup is,

18:19.683 --> 18:21.017
you have to kill me.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.227
That's correct.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.812
You may as well tell me, then.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.522
| mean, let's be honest,

18:25.605 --> 18:27.357
you couldn't kill me
even if you wanted to.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.776
Yeah? Try me.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.028
| already did. Back in the arena.

18:32.112 --> 18:34.823
| had you bang to rights, did I not?

18:34.906 --> 18:37.826
-That was just a game.
-Oh, a game? Right.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.620
-I won that game, did I not?
-No, you didn't.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.205
-One more minute...
-One more minute

18:42.289 --> 18:43.790
and you both would've been dead.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.751
Neither of you won.
Your plan was a half-baked disaster,

18:46.835 --> 18:50.297
and if it was not for that fire,
we would all be pushing up daisies.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.511
CENRED: You're certain it was Arthur?

18:56.594 --> 18:58.888
JARL: Oh, yes.
It was the Prince, all right.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.432
Matched your description exactly.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.601
Had his servant with him.
Him and another man.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.853
And you have proof of this?

19:14.237 --> 19:17.782
-Where were they headed?
-West. Into the Forest of Gedney.

19:17.866 --> 19:21.703
They've no horses, their tracks told us
as much. You'll soon run 'em down.

19:22.620 --> 19:23.830
Excellent.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.208
Always glad to be of help
to people of qualities

19:27.292 --> 19:29.002
such as yourselves, sir.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.879
Perhaps some small compensation

19:30.962 --> 19:33.048
for my time and trouble?

19:34.424 --> 19:36.426
My dear man, how remiss of me.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.803
You will have your reward this instant.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.305
(GRUNTS)

19:40.555 --> 19:41.639
(SCREAMS)

19:56.946 --> 19:59.783
Well, don't tell me we're actually here.

20:00.784 --> 20:01.951
GWAINE: Easy, Merlin.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.162
Wouldn't want to rile the Prince.

20:32.816 --> 20:35.026
It has to be here somewhere.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.878
Where is it?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.506
Hmm? Where's the Cup?

20:59.342 --> 21:00.760
-Tell me.
-Let him go, Arthur.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.096
-He's just a boy.
-Where is it?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.723
-Arthur.
-Stay out of this, Merlin.

21:05.807 --> 21:07.600
No, Arthur, really.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.314
One step closer.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.651
There is no need for violence,
Arthur Pendragon.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.028
The boy has done you no harm.

21:19.154 --> 21:20.613
Release him.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.783
Not without what I came for.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.036
You seek the Cup of Life, do you not?

21:29.831 --> 21:31.040
| do.

21:32.208 --> 21:33.585
It is yours.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.047
Please, now, the boy.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.776
You meddle with a power you do not
understand, Arthur Pendragon.

21:59.444 --> 22:02.113
By taking the Cup of Life
you risk more than you know.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.953
I'll take my chances, thanks.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.959
Let's go.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.636
ISELDIR: (TELEPATHY) Emrys...

22:27.138 --> 22:30.433
The Cup is in your care now.
Guard it well.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.103
The future of this land depends on it.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.951
Hard work this quest business.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.203
Trust me, it's a great deed
we did here today.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.330
Are you sure the Cup wasn't safer
with the Druids?

22:52.413 --> 22:54.457
They can't be trusted, Merlin.
No one can.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.460
The only safe place for the Cup
is the vaults of Camelot.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.463
Yeah, but we have to get it there first.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.222
Get the Cup.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.765
Then Kill them.

23:13.518 --> 23:16.437
We're approaching the border
of Cenred's lands.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.232
Beyond the forest lies Camelot.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.943
And food and water and a nice hot bath.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.319
Quiet.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.322
Listen.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.203
| don't hear anything.

23:33.204 --> 23:35.498
-Exactly.
-Never satisfied, you city-types.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.584
It's too noisy, it's too quiet...

23:38.293 --> 23:39.377
Run!

23:51.514 --> 23:52.557
Aah.

24:33.723 --> 24:36.392
GWAINE: Right.
That doesn't look too great.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.895
Arrow must've been poisoned.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.774
He's got a fever,
we need to keep him warm.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.525
| don't get it.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.444
Why all this bother over a cup?

24:47.695 --> 24:51.324
Because in the wrong hands
it can become a terrible weapon.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.701
Not so great Cenred's got it then?

24:54.744 --> 24:56.913
It's worse than you can
possibly imagine.

25:15.932 --> 25:17.475
Loyal friends,

25:18.768 --> 25:20.603
our time is at hand.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.480
From today

25:23.106 --> 25:24.816
no sword will fell you,

25:25.400 --> 25:27.735
no spear will stop you short.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.655
Your blood will not be spilled in vain,

25:31.656 --> 25:33.282
but in victory.

25:34.534 --> 25:37.537
You march with the mightiest weapon

26:28.671 --> 26:30.173

26:30.256 --> 26:32.592
I'm sure there's a simple
explanation, sire.

26:32.675 --> 26:35.344
You know as well as I do
he's been gone too long.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.722
Take a patrol,
as many men as you need.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.640
Whatever it takes, find him.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.142
Yes, sire.

26:45.772 --> 26:48.065
You show great strength, my lord.

26:48.149 --> 26:49.859
What do you mean?

26:50.234 --> 26:53.154
Day after day you must send
your only son into danger.

26:54.030 --> 26:56.657
Not a responsibility
any father would wish to bear.

26:58.701 --> 27:00.536
You must try not to worry.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.707
He's the first Knight of Camelot
and your greatest warrior.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.376
He's made it home safe in the past.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.712
Why should this time be any different?

27:13.591 --> 27:15.134

-Not really. Thanks for asking.

37:41.844 --> 37:44.304
How much longer
can he keep going like this?

37:44.388 --> 37:45.931
| don't know.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.833
Where now?

38:13.709 --> 38:14.960
Now...

38:15.377 --> 38:17.171
-Now we...
-Arthur,

38:17.921 --> 38:19.173
you can't go on.

38:19.256 --> 38:22.009
-We must... We must find the others.
-You can't go on without treatment.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.136
Guinevere, my father...

38:24.219 --> 38:25.596
-Elyan.
-Yeah.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.598
-Do you know the way to the dungeons?
-Yeah, I think so.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.933
Go with Gwaine.
See if you can find them.

38:32.019 --> 38:33.437
-I'm going with them.
-No, you're not.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.105
-That's an order.
-No, to hell with your orders.

38:35.189 --> 38:37.107
You're coming with me.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.696
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

38:53.248 --> 38:56.502
You're disobeying orders, Merlin.
I'll have you in the stocks for this.

38:56.585 --> 39:00.130
Fine. Now, stay put
and try not to move that leg.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.300
(CLATTERING)

39:25.739 --> 39:27.324
-Gaius!
-Merlin!

39:32.663 --> 39:35.582
-Are you all right?
-All the better for seeing you.

39:35.666 --> 39:36.959
(ARTHUR GROANING)

39:37.125 --> 39:38.335
Arthur.

39:38.961 --> 39:42.422
| tried to heal him using magic,
but it didn't work.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.555
This may hurt a bit, sire.

39:50.430 --> 39:51.473
(GROANS)

39:51.598 --> 39:52.891
The wound's infected.

39:52.975 --> 39:55.811
I'll have to redress the leg
to reduce the inflammation.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.438
No, no, no, no. We haven't got time.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.774
Just give me something to keep going.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.276
Yes, sire.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.738
It's the army of immortals, isn't it?

40:06.822 --> 40:09.533
We'll be lucky to get away
with our lives. Any of us.

40:12.578 --> 40:15.205
Where are you taking me? I am the King!

40:17.916 --> 40:19.626
| demand to know!

40:34.266 --> 40:35.851
GAIUS: The effect will be instant, sire,

40:35.934 --> 40:38.312
but I cannot guarantee
how long it'll last.

40:38.395 --> 40:39.855
Thank you, Gaius.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.315
(DOOR OPENING)

40:41.607 --> 40:44.901
-The King, sire, he's alive.
-Where is he?

40:44.985 --> 40:47.112
They're taking him to the throne room
as we speak.

40:47.195 --> 40:48.322
This may be my last chance.

40:48.405 --> 40:50.282
Arthur, there's too many of them.
You'll never make it.

40:50.365 --> 40:52.451
| won't leave my father
to die here alone.

40:52.534 --> 40:54.620
Gwaine, Elyan, take Gaius,

40:54.703 --> 40:57.372
and make your way to the woods
beyond the castle.

40:58.040 --> 40:59.916
| hope we meet again.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.797
Merlin, you should go with them.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.843
Nah, I've seen the woods already.

41:16.725 --> 41:18.727
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

41:28.403 --> 41:30.238
-Are you all right?
-Keep moving.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.253
Well, Uther,

41:46.588 --> 41:48.882
how the mighty have fallen.

41:49.466 --> 41:51.343
The guards are immortal,
they'll cut you to ribbons!

41:51.426 --> 41:52.969
What use are you dead?

41:57.599 --> 42:00.102
| don't think you'll be needing this
anymore.

42:00.185 --> 42:01.937
This is unlawful.

42:02.229 --> 42:04.064
You cannot do this.

42:04.147 --> 42:06.608
You have no right to the throne!

42:16.034 --> 42:17.703
No, she does not.

42:21.581 --> 42:22.624
But I do.

42:33.176 --> 42:35.303
| am your daughter, after all.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.817
Don't look so surprised.
I've known for some time.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.465
By the power vested in me,

43:14.426 --> 43:17.387
| crown thee, Morgana Pendragon,

43:19.431 --> 43:21.141
Queen of Camelot.

44:08.188 --> 44:09.397
No!
