on the city ballot failed,

under your command.

He lifted a brick of tar
off the El Salvadorans.

We got a CI next to him.
When he jumps dirty, we'll know.

Vic and his guys are tight.
Lemansky, he's a soldier.

00:38.640 --> 00:41.108
So you're gonna need
something to drive a wedge
between him and Mac.

to bring down Mac.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.593
I mean, I'm trying to get inside it
and I will get inside it.

12:42.800 --> 12:45.268
But I need you to add
that personal element to it.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.950
The department brought you in
to close this and you come
running back to me?

12:49.160 --> 12:54.917
I can just see where
this is going, and I'm not
above asking for help.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.112
Besides, I thought Crowley
was your friend.

12:59.800 --> 13:00.994
He was.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.760
You suspected Mackey all along,
and you just let him go.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.873
I pursued it as far as I could.
Yeah, well, here's another chance.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.594
Mackey's out the door
in four months.
Forced retirement.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.997
Out the door?
Fifteen-year pension.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.873
That ain't a bad reward
for killing a cop, is it?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.037
Sorry. Please, sorry.

13:21.520 --> 13:24.830
We could never prove it.
But you know it.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.431
And now we got someone
that can prove it.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.197
Hold on a second.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.000
Witness give you something?
You gotta see this.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.636
Sure looks a lot like
the Salvadoran we
leaned on today. Doomsday?

13:46.080 --> 13:49.516
Could be it. It's hard to tell.
Besides, he's tied up.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.598
Is that Doomsday?
We put this out yet?

13:52.800 --> 13:55.519
Yeah, went out on
the wire a few minutes
ago. Gets worse.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.836
IDs came back
on the victims
at the house.

13:58.040 --> 14:00.156
Community college geeks.
No history of trouble.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.749
One of the males' last names
was Hughes.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.791
As in Hughes Used Cars?
It was his kid.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.036
Big D said he didn't pay
last week, remember?

14:07.240 --> 14:09.595
So Doomsday sent a message.
We don't know that yet.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.678
It was a couple of busted windshields.
Why'd we push so hard?

14:12.880 --> 14:16.953
Because there's still
some goddamn laws in Farmington,
no matter what the voters reject.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.352
Plus he came at me.
He was in my face.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.835
That the suspect in the triple murder?
Yeah.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.075
Do we know him?

14:24.280 --> 14:27.113
Could be a Salvadoran lowlife
who lives in the neighbourhood.

14:27.320 --> 14:31.074
We're trying to get a 20 on him now.
You think it's another racial incident?

14:31.280 --> 14:32.633
I'll let you know.
BILLINGS: Great.

14:32.840 --> 14:35.035
Grab some extra unis
if you need them.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.390
Yeah, if we can find one.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.348
So we cause a triple murder
before breakfast,

14:41.560 --> 14:43.869
start a race war before dinner.
That's a pretty good day.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.231
Get the word out to the Aztecs
and Zulus that this wasn't retribution.

14:47.440 --> 14:50.034
Some beef about
business, that's all.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.152
You with me?
Yeah.

Holy shit.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.510
You got a minute?
Sure, come in.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.154
I need a line on a Salvadoran,
calls himself Doomsday.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.874
You heard of him?
No. Know where he lives?

15:27.080 --> 15:29.992
Temple Colter area.
You got friends down there?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.873
I'll have to spread
a little love around.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.875
I need to pull this guy
off the street now.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.038
Now, this is one of
those times you can earn
yourself some real money.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.073
That's too much, Vic.
All I need is
a couple dubs for my girls.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.599
Keep what you save.

15:50.800 --> 15:54.076
Ten times that amount
if we can get him in custody.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.712
DUTCH: Yeah.
That's what I like to hear.

All the emperor needs
is a toga and a violin
while Farmington burns.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.394
They offered you that job first.
You turned it down.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.795
It would have been yours
but you screwed it up.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.671
Thanks for coming in.
How's your husband?

16:14.880 --> 16:17.838
At the hospital
they said the machines
are keeping him alive.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.873
But his brain...
Sorry.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.959
We just need
your signature here

16:25.160 --> 16:27.958
and you can take
his personal effects.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.632
Did you see your husband
last night?

16:35.840 --> 16:39.310
I took him to church for his meeting.
CLAUDETTE: Is it a 12-step program?

16:39.520 --> 16:42.114
They didn't work for Guillermo.
He just kept on drinking.

16:42.320 --> 16:43.673
DUTCH:
What sort of meeting was this?

16:43.880 --> 16:48.237
Señor Romero has them
drink until the alcohol
cures the sickness.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.953
Aversion therapy.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.914
You weren't concerned
when he didn't come home?

16:53.120 --> 16:55.350
Señor Romero lets them
sleep at the church

Yes.

DUTCH:
We need to talk to you
about Guillermo Solis.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.794
Is there a problem?

17:19.280 --> 17:23.592
He's in a coma.
He may not live.
Too much drink.

17:24.480 --> 17:27.472
Lord bless his soul.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.636
We understand you
were treating him
for substance abuse

17:29.840 --> 17:31.159
at the church last night.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.794
I don't treat people.
I don't have a license for that.

He attends our prayer group.

17:35.440 --> 17:39.194
Where you feed booze
to alcoholics?
That's fascinating.

they drink of
their own free will.

This aversion therapy,
it really works for some people?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.795
It's how I conquered
my issues with alcohol.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.798
Otherwise, I wouldn't have
my business and my church.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.274
My ex-wife was a drunk.

17:54.480 --> 17:57.677
Do you think if I'd hauled her
off to happy hour every night,
I could've saved the marriage?

I wouldn't wanna speculate.

CLAUDETTE:
Who else was there last night?

18:00.840 --> 18:02.592
Hector Santiago.
He works at the church.

18:02.800 --> 18:05.314
And he's going through the therapy.
Just the three of you?

18:05.520 --> 18:08.637
Well, the group gets smaller
as more of us are healed.

Sure.

about her dogs.

ain't a member of PETA.

LEM:
Look, I didn't do anything wrong.
You're not my captain anymore.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.629
You took some heroin,
you got caught.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.912
Now, we're not just talking
about your career here, Lem.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.271
The city referendum showed all of us
what the public thinks of cops.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.914
The department's fighting
to change that perception

20:15.120 --> 20:17.350
so somebody has to pay a price.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.152
And right now, that's you.

20:19.360 --> 20:22.511
Well, you know what?
I'll take my chances
with the truth in court.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.110
Everything that Lieutenant Kavanaugh
told you about Terry was true.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.194
Terry didn't have a grudge
against Vic going in,

20:32.720 --> 20:36.633
but it only took him
two weeks to find out
that Vic was a dirty cop.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.471
I have his original notes
detailing his suspicions.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.992
He was your teammate,
he was a threat,
so he had to die.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.714
No. Never!

20:52.080 --> 20:54.116
You didn't know, did you?

20:56.520 --> 20:58.875
Vic never told you.

All this time, I thought
the four of you
were in it together,

21:04.600 --> 21:07.034
but you really didn't know.

21:08.840 --> 21:10.956
This changes everything.

21:12.240 --> 21:17.155
You're saying you didn't
know about it until right now.
It was the other guys.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.191
I didn't say that. I didn't say that.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.392
But you didn't know.

21:22.960 --> 21:28.592
I mean, I respect a guy
being loyal, but now
you're protecting a guy

21:28.800 --> 21:31.030

have any stake in.

21:31.240 --> 21:34.915

told me the death penalty
was too good for.

This is a damn witch hunt
right now.

You gotta choose.

Vic did not kill Terry.
So prove it.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.272

an innocent guy,

have to help.

who took out one of your own?

22:09.640 --> 22:12.996

Guillermo was a jealous man.
The drinking only made it worse.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.438
You give him reason

Why are you asking me
those questions?

22:28.960 --> 22:30.473
Those are nice shoes.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.319
You get those from Romero?
Saw a pair like them.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.159
They were a gift from El Señor.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.360
How long have you been
sleeping with Romero?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.669
I have never done that.

22:43.880 --> 22:46.394
But he's made advances,
hasn't he?

22:47.040 --> 22:50.669
I'm a married woman.
He made me feel good.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.553
But I told El Señor
I would not betray my vows.

22:53.760 --> 22:57.639
You mean "till death do us part"?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.272
You know what? Know what?

23:03.480 --> 23:05.198
I need a decision.
I need a decision.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.072
What happened
to having some time?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.918
Can't believe you need any.

23:09.120 --> 23:11.236
Look, Vic is your friend
and you're loyal,

23:11.680 --> 23:14.877
but you also gotta be loyal
to your badge.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.833
Gotta be loyal to yourself.

You tell me. Do I parade you
into Police One

23:29.400 --> 23:35.032
or do I call a technician
and wire you up?

ACEVEDA:
You know, Lem,
if Vic is innocent like you say,

Right.

Where does Mackey like to put these?
On the chest.

Yeah, I'll hurry back.

Well, I'll start. Jump in

No way he had enough

much less hold the bottle.

sometimes how much

can put away.
