[engine revving]

00:20.194 --> 00:21.499
Hey, Tommy.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.327
Good morning, Mr. Jane.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.242
- You're all set.
- Have a good one.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.723
You too,
have a good one.

00:27.810 --> 00:29.159
[instrumental music]

00:51.268 --> 00:52.617
[music continues]

00:58.754 --> 01:00.060

01:09.330 --> 01:10.983
[instrumental music]

01:19.557 --> 01:20.863
Good morning,
everybody.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.169
What's so good
about it?

01:22.256 --> 01:23.344
Here, have a file.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.128
The division's being
audited again.

01:25.215 --> 01:28.871
No problem. Let me just put milk
in this, and I'll dig in.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.047
"No problem."
What's with her?

01:31.134 --> 01:33.658
[Kimball]
'You mean, why isn't she
cynical and jaded like you?'

01:33.745 --> 01:35.312
Notice her relaxed
body language

01:35.399 --> 01:37.619
the general sense
of emotional satisfaction?

01:37.706 --> 01:39.011
Yeah.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.318
Someone's engaged her
romantic interest.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.233
[scoffs]
Who?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.105
Oh, I couldn't say.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.890
Nah, she's focused on her work,
that's all.

01:47.977 --> 01:50.284
Well, then I have to assume that
the man that kissed her outside

01:50.371 --> 01:51.894
was making an embarrassing
mistake.

01:51.981 --> 01:54.114
Hm? What?
Who kissed her?

01:54.201 --> 01:55.593
Uh, I didn't catch
his name.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.247
Ah, it's probably that
knucklehead from payroll.

01:57.334 --> 01:59.075
'He's been stalking
her like a chicken.'

01:59.162 --> 02:01.077
What did this
man look like?

02:01.164 --> 02:02.644
Lisbon!

02:02.731 --> 02:03.819
[glass clatters]

02:03.906 --> 02:05.386
How do you stalk
a chicken?

02:05.473 --> 02:07.083
You know what I'm talking about.

02:11.218 --> 02:13.829
"There's a very
large bomb nearby"?

02:13.916 --> 02:15.961
"Are you smart enough
to find it?"

02:18.312 --> 02:20.618
- Another bomb threat.
- That's the third, this year.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.272
Not on my phone, it isn't.

02:22.359 --> 02:23.926
Well, granted, they don't
usually come through CBI

02:24.013 --> 02:25.580
'but that's what
the drills are for.'

02:25.667 --> 02:28.148
The text read, "are you
smart enough to find it? "

02:28.235 --> 02:30.106
I think this was
directed at me.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.195
Of course, you think
this is about you.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.720
Just relax.
It could be a hoax.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.766
[Jane]
'It could be.'

02:37.853 --> 02:40.203
- Where is the bomb squad?
- They're on their way now.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.031
PD did an initial sweep
of the building.

02:42.118 --> 02:43.511
So far, they haven't
found anything.

02:43.598 --> 02:46.992
"are you smart enough
to find it?"

02:47.079 --> 02:49.560
Okay, listen, if this
really is about Jane

02:49.647 --> 02:50.909
I don't want him just,
I..

02:52.781 --> 02:53.956
- Hey!
- Jane!

02:54.043 --> 02:56.001
[siren wailing]

02:56.088 --> 02:57.394
Jane, stop right there!

02:57.481 --> 02:58.569
[cell phone ringing]

02:58.656 --> 02:59.875
Minelli.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.746
- Yes, sir.
- Jane!

03:01.833 --> 03:05.141
Let me explain what happened.
Jane got a text on his phone.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.317
The text said,
"a very large bomb."

03:07.404 --> 03:11.365
A large bomb can only be
transported in a large car.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.281
They didn't say inside CBI.
They said nearby.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.979
Ergo, the parking lot.
Simple.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.242
Exactly. They challenged
you to an easy puzzle.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
'They want you
to find the bomb.'

03:21.113 --> 03:23.725
If there is a bomb, it could
be just a hoax, like you said.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.335
[cell phone ringing]

03:25.422 --> 03:26.815
Yes, sir.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.947
I'll have him back in a minute.

03:29.034 --> 03:31.820
I'm trying, sir.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.127
[muffled yelling]

03:35.215 --> 03:37.304
Hey! Lisbon!

03:37.391 --> 03:38.392
Found it!

03:38.479 --> 03:39.523
[yelling continues]

03:41.699 --> 03:43.266
Oh, no.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.702
[yelling continues]

03:47.923 --> 03:50.752
[beeping]

03:50.839 --> 03:53.624
[yelling continues]

03:53.711 --> 03:56.497
[beeping continues]

04:00.762 --> 04:02.459
Shoot it out!
Shoot it out with your gun!

04:02.546 --> 04:05.027
'I-I can't.
There's no time! Come on!'

04:05.114 --> 04:06.942
[muffled yelling]

04:07.029 --> 04:08.248
'Jane, come on, let's go!'

04:08.335 --> 04:09.597
Come on, run, Jane!

04:09.684 --> 04:11.860
'Jane, run!
I mean it, come on!'

04:11.947 --> 04:14.732
'Jane! Come on run,
come on!'

04:14.819 --> 04:16.212
[beep]

04:18.606 --> 04:19.607
[beep]

04:22.218 --> 04:25.047
[explosion]

04:31.967 --> 04:34.883
[siren wailing]

04:41.846 --> 04:43.152
- I'm okay.
- You alright?

04:43.239 --> 04:44.371
I'm okay, I'm okay.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.807
- Alright.
- I'm fine.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.722
I'm gonna get you help,
I need an ambulance now.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.854
No, no ambulance.
I just got something in my eyes.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.595
Aah!

04:55.556 --> 04:57.340
I can't see.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.081
I can't see!

04:59.864 --> 05:02.127
[intense music]

05:03.781 --> 05:05.043
[instrumental music]

05:12.834 --> 05:15.706
You're a lucky man, Mr. Jane.
This could have been much worse.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.969
Yes, that's what people
keep telling me.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.363
But why is it
I can't see, doctor?

05:20.450 --> 05:22.452
Well, there's a
moderate concussion

05:22.539 --> 05:24.715
with some short-term memory loss

05:24.802 --> 05:28.284
disorientation, headache and
of course, fleeting blindness.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.678
It's most likely due to
small floating blood clots

05:30.765 --> 05:33.594
in the vessels around the eyes,
demonstrating a CVI.

05:33.681 --> 05:35.465
'or cortical visual impairment.'

05:35.552 --> 05:37.119
How long will his
vision be affected?

05:37.206 --> 05:39.121
Well,
that's hard to say, really.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.558
the body's healing powers
are unpredictable

05:41.645 --> 05:44.300
but 48 to 72 hours
is the norm.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.389
We must wait and see,
to speak.

05:46.476 --> 05:48.913
Huh! Humor. Great.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.959
Everybody loves a witty
doctor in times of trouble.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.352
You know, I've heard enough,
do you think you can

05:52.439 --> 05:54.092
take this conversation
outside, please?

05:54.179 --> 05:56.747
Mr. Jane, this is temporary.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.010
'Your sight will return
and you'll be back to work'

05:59.097 --> 06:00.621
'but it's gonna take
time and patience.'

06:00.708 --> 06:03.537
Well, the time I have, but
patience I lost a while ago.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.626
You're alive. Appreciate it.

06:05.713 --> 06:08.019
Oh, I do. Believe me, I do.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.152
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll check in again later.

06:10.239 --> 06:13.111
Thank you, doctor.

06:13.198 --> 06:14.374
- Ow!
- I'll do worse.

06:14.461 --> 06:15.766
If you don't stop
mouthing off

06:15.853 --> 06:16.854
'to people who are
trying to help you.'

06:16.941 --> 06:18.290
You pinched me.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.335
- How is he?
- Guess what.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.076
He's a bad patient.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.991
- Who would've thought?
- I'm not a bad patient.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.210
- She's a bad visitor.
- 'What'd you find out?'

06:25.297 --> 06:28.953
The victim is James Medina, 44,
stockbroker, out of Highlands.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.999
The van wasn't his. It was
reported stolen yesterday.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.870
We're digging up everything,
we can on Medina.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.524
The question is, is it
possible he was on

06:34.611 --> 06:36.352
'some bizarre suicide mission?'

06:36.439 --> 06:39.094
No.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.965
I looked in his eyes.

06:41.052 --> 06:44.142
He was very much a man who
didn't want to be where he was.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.970
Whoever did this wanted me

06:46.057 --> 06:48.320
to watch James Medina
die in terror.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.931
They nearly killed
you, too.

06:50.018 --> 06:50.932
Well, that wasn't
the intention, though.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.629
Well, what then?

06:52.716 --> 06:54.805
"You're next" was written
on the man's forehead.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.154
Why?

06:56.241 --> 06:59.157
[sighs]
I don't know why.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.989
- You're gonna be fine.
- Yeah, probably.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.556
'We're gonna find
who did this.'

07:06.643 --> 07:07.731
Good.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.518
Oh, please don't look
at each other like that.

07:11.605 --> 07:12.997
Like what? You can't see.

07:13.084 --> 07:16.218
I canfeel.
I can feel your pity.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.741
[Lisbon]
'Oh, please. Would you stop?'

07:17.828 --> 07:19.830
We'll be back.

07:19.917 --> 07:21.092
Later, man.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.148
[sobs]
Thank you, Rose.

07:37.239 --> 07:38.632
[sighs]

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
Alright, you two.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.593
I love you.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.987
You be good with your
Aunty Rose now, okay?

07:46.074 --> 07:48.511
- You promise?
- Mm-hm.

07:48.598 --> 07:49.556
See you.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.645
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.215
Sweet kids.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.783
Thank you.
Jim loved them very much.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.742
I'm sorry, Mrs. Medina,
but, we have to ask you

08:01.829 --> 08:03.004
a couple questions
about your husband.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.312
He didn't seem preoccupied,
trouble by anything unusual?

08:07.399 --> 08:10.794
Preoccupied, yes, but there's
nothing unusual about that.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.710
My husband was a stockbroker
and nowadays

08:13.797 --> 08:15.712
that's like being
a professional gambler.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.280
What about your personal
finances?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.761
I never let Jim put all our
money into the stock market.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.067
Did he ever mention any
particular client being unhappy?

08:23.154 --> 08:24.547
Do you know how many
clients have lost

08:24.634 --> 08:26.375
their money in the
last six months?

08:26.462 --> 08:29.030
'A lot of people are angry,
and they blame their brokers.'

08:29.117 --> 08:32.816
Jim's received hate mail,
phone calls, e-mail.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.688
Any specific threats,
did he ever mention names?

08:34.775 --> 08:37.081
There was an ex-coworker,
Terry Andrews.

08:37.168 --> 08:39.954
He came by the house a few
times. He was very threatening.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.612
Thank you.

08:45.699 --> 08:47.701
[sniffles]

08:50.312 --> 08:52.793
Terence Carter Andrews,
46 years old

08:52.880 --> 08:54.751
worked for two years
at Lynch-Halstead

08:54.838 --> 08:56.448
in the junior trader program.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.494
Tax records indicate
that he also worked as a guard

08:58.581 --> 08:59.930
for several security companies

09:00.017 --> 09:01.497
that cover
the State Capitol System.

09:01.584 --> 09:03.804
He was a State House employee,
who worked here.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.763
That's what it says. He also
has a rap sheet on him.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.199
Domestic violence and two DUI's.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.549
This is him?

09:09.636 --> 09:11.420
[Rigsby]
'Where is he working now?'

09:11.507 --> 09:15.337
Guest relations manager
at something called "Hype".

09:15.424 --> 09:16.773
[upbeat music]

09:26.783 --> 09:29.046
You, little Miss Fierce,
can come in.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.832
Lose the backup dancer.
He's too, too butch.

09:32.789 --> 09:34.835
Get lost, Fluffy.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.924
'Are you Terence Andrews?'

09:37.011 --> 09:38.316
What do you guys want?

09:38.403 --> 09:40.362
Do people call you
Terry or Terence?

09:41.537 --> 09:43.365
They call me, Mr. Andrews.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.976
Someone killed
James Medina today.

09:46.063 --> 09:48.457
- Thoughts?
- Yeah.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.894
I'd like to buy, whoever did it,
a nice bottle of French brandy.

09:50.981 --> 09:55.638
- Flat out hated him, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, I did.

09:55.725 --> 09:56.944
What, do you think I had
something to do with it?

09:57.031 --> 09:58.641
Yeah, it crossed our minds.

09:58.728 --> 10:01.035
Why don't you come downtown
with us, answer a few questions?

10:01.122 --> 10:02.993
No, I don't think so.
You know why?

10:03.080 --> 10:04.429
Because I didn't do it.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.257
- Come on, man. Let's go.
- Get off me!

10:06.344 --> 10:08.346
- Now you want some, too?
- No, thank you.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.391
[taser zaps]

10:09.478 --> 10:11.132
[grunts]

10:11.219 --> 10:13.525
Everybody step back.
Give him some air. Fun's over.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.398
Are you okay,Mr. Andrews?

10:22.012 --> 10:24.667
[instrumental music]

10:31.065 --> 10:33.807
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in the hospital?

10:33.894 --> 10:35.635
- Nope.
- Yes, you are.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.246
No, they've had enough of me.
Can't say I blame 'em.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.465
Officer Powell here was kind
enough to give me a ride back.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.597
[cell phone rings]

10:41.684 --> 10:43.294
Thank you. I guess.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.079
Have a good one,
Mr. Jane.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.777
Yeah. Go ahead. Talk to your
boyfriend. I don't mind.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.389
Shush.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.304
- Why are you embarrassed?
- I'm not.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.045
- What the hell--
- Oh, doctor's orders.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.960
She said it was the best thing
for me to do, get back to work.

10:57.047 --> 10:59.354
She did not, she said you
insulted the entire ward

10:59.441 --> 11:00.660
and were a complete
pain in the ass.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.010
Nah!So?

11:03.097 --> 11:04.881
So you can't do that.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.317
Well, what was I
supposed to do

11:06.404 --> 11:08.842
just sit there
and listen to television?

11:08.929 --> 11:10.278
Besides, the food was terrible.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.845
- You need the rest.
- I need to work.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.629
- You're blind.
- It's no problem, honestly.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.152
My other senses
are heightened.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.764
They're super heightened.
I'm like Daredevil.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.374
Now if you'll excuse me.

11:19.461 --> 11:22.072
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.161
[metal clangs]

11:24.248 --> 11:26.076
Ah. Heightened.

11:28.731 --> 11:31.168
Where were you
yesterday morning?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.388
My shift at the club
ended at 3:30.

11:33.475 --> 11:36.391
I went back to my place,
watched a little bit of TV

11:36.478 --> 11:38.219
then I went to bed.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.525
I slept till about
11 o'clock or so.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.179
Anyone who can vouch
for that time frame?

11:42.266 --> 11:44.791
No. I live alone.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.706
'On account of my lady walked
out on me, when I lost my job.'

11:46.793 --> 11:48.403
Sorry. Don't mind me.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.752
Jane?

11:49.839 --> 11:51.232
What is this?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.668
What is this?

11:54.539 --> 11:55.758
- He's blind?
- Yeah.

11:55.845 --> 11:56.803
[cane clanging]

11:56.890 --> 11:58.674
Uh, Sorry.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.545
[clanging continues]

12:01.590 --> 12:03.592
Cool, huh?

12:03.679 --> 12:08.075
[clears throat]
Yeah, so, uh,
did you kill James Medina?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.554
Did I kill James Medina?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.208
Screw him.

12:11.295 --> 12:15.299
I didn't kill him.
I could have and I wanted to..

12:15.386 --> 12:17.171
...but I didn't.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.650
[sniffing]

12:18.738 --> 12:20.435
What are you doing?

12:20.522 --> 12:22.959
Have we ever met before?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.004
No.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.223
So, what happened?

12:26.310 --> 12:28.051
Why did you and Medina fight
in the first place?

12:28.138 --> 12:30.271
I was a junior trader
in the company's program.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.968
[Andrew]
'And he had been picking
on me for months.'

12:32.055 --> 12:33.709
'I took a job
his nephew wanted.'

12:33.796 --> 12:38.018
Anyway, a freakin' envelope
falls off his desk.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.890
"Pick it up," he said.
Like that, "pick it up."

12:40.977 --> 12:42.457
I don't think so.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.893
"pick it up your own
damn self," I said.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.721
Big deal.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.462
But I guess he figures
I'm just, you know I'm gonna

12:47.549 --> 12:51.466
snap my fingers and totally
just ruin this dude's life.

12:51.553 --> 12:56.688
Can I hold your hand?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.038
[scoffs]

13:02.738 --> 13:04.566
Artistic fingers.

13:07.656 --> 13:08.700
[sighs]

13:08.788 --> 13:09.876
Soft.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.834
Don't do that.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.664
Nice to talk with you, Terry.
Be well. You can let him go.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.753
Uh, that's, uh,
not your call.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.016
Well, I didn't say
youmustlet him go.

13:20.103 --> 13:23.063
I said that you can...
if you want.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.326
Being that he's innocent.

13:25.413 --> 13:26.370
Thank you.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.589
- Jane?
- Oh!

13:27.676 --> 13:29.939
Oh, that was loud.
That scared me.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.811
How many times
do I have to tell you

13:31.898 --> 13:33.813
to stop interrupting
interviews like that?

13:33.900 --> 13:34.857
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:34.944 --> 13:35.902
[cane clangs]

13:35.989 --> 13:37.729
Oh! just a minute.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.949
What are you doing?

13:40.036 --> 13:42.343
How will I know if I can see
or not, if I have bandages on?

13:45.346 --> 13:47.304
Ow.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.219
[sighs]

13:49.306 --> 13:50.655
Here goes.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.529
Well?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.534
Black as night.

13:59.621 --> 14:01.318
I'm sorry.

14:01.405 --> 14:02.754
Never mind.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.321
Andrews didn't do it.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.932
Did you sense that
with your superpowers?

14:06.019 --> 14:07.281
Yes, I did.

14:07.368 --> 14:10.284
Uh, he's filled with
anger, but, uh, not

14:10.371 --> 14:13.156
fearful, guilty,
murderous anger.

14:13.243 --> 14:16.551
That has a tang of
ammonia about it.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.945
His is a more clean,
righteous anger.

14:19.032 --> 14:21.730
- Lemony.
- Lemony?

14:21.817 --> 14:23.210
This blind thing
really works.

14:23.297 --> 14:24.689
Without my vision,
I can tune into

14:24.776 --> 14:26.343
my other senses
much more clearly.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.129
That's great. Let me go make
you a superhero costume.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.782
What do you wanna
be called?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.132
- What are you doing?
- I wanna know.

14:32.219 --> 14:33.655
What your face feels like,
when you're smiling.

14:33.742 --> 14:34.743
[chuckles]

14:34.830 --> 14:36.745
Uh, so what's the deal, boss?

14:39.400 --> 14:42.011
Have forensics check him
for any explosives residue.

14:42.098 --> 14:43.795
'If he comes up clean,
let him go.'

14:43.883 --> 14:45.058
Will do.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.624
I'm still convinced
there's a connection

14:46.711 --> 14:48.539
between Medina and me,
so before you make me

14:48.626 --> 14:50.541
that superhero costume
I'm looking forward to

14:50.628 --> 14:52.804
could you take me to
visit with his widow?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.415
- Maybe.
- Thank you.

14:54.502 --> 14:55.807
And incidentally,
you're smelling

14:55.895 --> 14:58.593
particularly good
today.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.117
Is that cinnamon
in the mix there somewhere?

15:01.204 --> 15:02.423
Lisbon?

15:06.296 --> 15:08.908
Your tea is right
in front of you, Mr. Jane.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.911
- Ah, thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.609
Mrs. Medina, we don't mean
to keep you from your family.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.741
We just have a few more
questions to ask you.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.700
[sighs]

15:18.787 --> 15:22.443
I understand.
I'm... happy to help.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.707
I can feel what a warm,
caring home this is.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.275
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.581
I think whoever did this
was targeting your husband

15:30.668 --> 15:32.801
and me also.

15:32.888 --> 15:36.631
I don't know why
but something links us.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.242
I have to ask,
have we ever met before?

15:39.329 --> 15:41.418
Not that I know of.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.812
Would it be a terrible
inconvenience to show me

15:43.899 --> 15:46.510
some of your husband's
personal things?

15:46.597 --> 15:49.513
Jewelry,
anything he used a lot?

15:49.600 --> 15:52.342
Sure. I guess. Why?

15:52.429 --> 15:54.431
Holding something of
James' would help me

15:54.518 --> 15:57.608
pick up a feel for him,
get a sense of his being.

15:57.695 --> 15:59.741
Okay.

15:59.828 --> 16:00.916
Excuse me.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.048
'Thank you.'

16:04.267 --> 16:07.053
A sense of his being?
What are you playing at?

16:07.140 --> 16:08.880
Just go with it.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.665
I have to practice this
touchy-feely stuff.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.058
It's been a while.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.885
You're not gonna be
blind forever.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.366
No, right, 'cause bad stuff
like this doesn't happen

16:16.453 --> 16:19.369
nearly as often
as people think it does.

16:24.374 --> 16:26.463
- Bifocals?
- Mm-hmm.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.988
Jim couldn't read
without them.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.120
He was considering
surgery but

16:31.207 --> 16:33.644
I liked the way he looked
in his glasses.

16:33.731 --> 16:34.645
He held that
because of me.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.219
[Jane]
'Did he like horses?'

16:43.306 --> 16:45.569
We liked to ride together.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.833
We were planning to take a trip
up the coast this fall.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.924
This feels expensive.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.709
Uh, yes.

16:54.796 --> 16:57.581
He only wore that
to business functions.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.062
There's a jewel
with an engraving on the back.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.456
'What is that engraving?'

17:02.543 --> 17:04.240
It's a bull.

17:04.327 --> 17:07.113
It was a company gift
from Lynch-Halstead.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.638
A little too much bling
for Jim's everyday taste.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.075
[instrumental music]

17:28.699 --> 17:30.266
Jane?

17:32.921 --> 17:36.838
Well, uh, thank you
for your time, Mrs. Medina.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.279
[Jane]
'The watch I recalled
was the exact same.'

17:43.366 --> 17:46.848
It had the same engraving
on the back as James Medina's

17:46.935 --> 17:49.198
and his was from
Lynch-Halstead.

17:49.285 --> 17:51.722
Thank you.
Uh..

17:51.809 --> 17:53.202
So, years ago

17:53.289 --> 17:54.551
I must've done
a psychic reading

17:54.638 --> 17:55.944
for someone else
connected to the firm.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.163
You don't know who?

17:57.250 --> 17:59.382
I can't remember.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.211
I tried to see the woman's face,
recall her name.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.431
- I-I just can't do it.
- But she paid you.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.607
And was hurt so badly,
she's still holding a grudge.

18:06.694 --> 18:07.956
Well, probably.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.001
The man's blind.
Go easy, maybe.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.265
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay. You're fine.

18:12.352 --> 18:13.788
[cell phone ringing]

18:13.875 --> 18:16.051
Did you keep a record
of all your customers

18:16.138 --> 18:17.183
'or clients or whatever
you called them?'

18:17.270 --> 18:18.880
[Jane]
yeah, I had to.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.187
'I had to keep track of all
the lies I'd already told them.'

18:21.274 --> 18:23.189
- 'Oh, where are they?'
- Uh..

18:23.276 --> 18:27.236
Probably on a disk in my boxes
over-over there, I expect.

18:27.323 --> 18:30.021
Van Pelt, why don't you help
Jane find his records?

18:30.109 --> 18:33.112
Oh, first, could someone
please make me a cup of tea?

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
Is that a yes?

18:39.466 --> 18:41.598
[sniffing]

18:41.685 --> 18:42.817
Rigsby.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.472
[instrumental music]

18:54.307 --> 18:56.135
Thank you.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.325
- Did you put the milk in--
- Milk in first? Yep.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.022
Just like you asked.

19:15.806 --> 19:16.764
You sure the water boiled--

19:16.851 --> 19:19.114
Was truly boiling? Yep.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.036
- Tastes weird.
- Tastes weird?

19:31.779 --> 19:34.347
Jane, I need to ask you
a favor.

19:34.434 --> 19:35.870
I need you to, uh..

19:35.957 --> 19:37.959
I need to you find out
from Van Pelt about this guy

19:38.046 --> 19:39.830
she's dating, you know,
what's the score?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.441
- The score?
- Is it serious?

19:41.528 --> 19:43.617
- Are they, uh, you know?
- Ask her yourself.

19:43.704 --> 19:46.315
Yeah, right. No. Come on.
You know the situation.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.665
It's against the rules,
relationships between coworkers.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.014
What are you,
a man or a mouse?

19:50.101 --> 19:51.842
Well, man, obviously.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.453
Could've fooled me.

19:53.540 --> 19:55.368
If it's that guy from
payroll, I will kill him.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.761
Well, that would be
a strong, romantic statement.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.633
Women like a man that
would kill for them.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.287
- Hey, Van Pelt!
- Don't!

20:01.374 --> 20:02.636
- What?
- No. No.

20:02.723 --> 20:06.205
- Trust me. Honesty's better.
- No.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.945
What's up?

20:08.032 --> 20:09.556
Grace, personal question.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.340
Rigsby and I were
wondering, uh..

20:11.427 --> 20:15.649
...who is this man, you were
kissing by the coffee cart?

20:15.736 --> 20:17.390
That's...that's none
of your business.

20:17.477 --> 20:19.566
- Not from payroll?
- Payroll?

20:19.653 --> 20:21.524
No, he doesn't even work here.
It's none of your business.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.570
Well, thank heavens
for that, at least.

20:23.657 --> 20:26.094
- No killing needed.
- Huh. Don't be so sure.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.791
You'll see.
Honesty's best.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.576
Yeah, well, honestly, I'd like
to kick your butt right now.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.059
I'll take you.

20:35.146 --> 20:37.584
but could you take me to my
couch first, please?

20:37.671 --> 20:40.282
- Yes.
- Thank you.

20:40.369 --> 20:41.805
You're in your office.
Here's the table on the--

20:41.892 --> 20:43.677
Yeah, Yep.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.200
- 'Here's the couch.'
- 'Alright.'

20:45.287 --> 20:46.984
- 'You're very good at this.'
- 'Thank you.'

20:47.071 --> 20:49.378
'Thanks for your lovely tea.'

20:54.601 --> 20:56.646
That was cruel.
Why did you do that?

20:56.733 --> 20:59.736
Oh, it's this blindness
nuisance. It makes me mean.

20:59.823 --> 21:01.651
I'm-I'm sorry.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.003
But you two,
do need to talk.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.615
There's nothing
to talk about.

21:08.702 --> 21:09.659
Is that?

21:09.746 --> 21:11.400
- Uh..
- Sorry.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.882
Uh, a white CD with "RPB."
written on it in black?

21:14.969 --> 21:16.884
Could be.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.668
You have a lot to talk about.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.670
Like what?

21:20.757 --> 21:24.152
Is it serious,
you and coffee cart man?

21:24.239 --> 21:25.936
It's too early to tell.

21:26.023 --> 21:29.026
I'd like to meet him.
What floor does he work on?

21:29.113 --> 21:30.463
He doesn't.
He's a lawyer.

21:30.550 --> 21:32.726
- Ah.
- He was just visiting.

21:32.813 --> 21:34.336
And no offense,
but why does my personal life

21:34.423 --> 21:36.295
have any concern to you..

21:36.382 --> 21:37.470
...or Rigsby, for that matter?

21:38.862 --> 21:41.038
Well, me,
I-I'm just nosy.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.779
'But Rigsby, he loves you.'

21:45.042 --> 21:47.175
'He's just scared of
emotional commitment.'

21:47.262 --> 21:49.525
'And you're attracted to him,
but you're deeply repressed.'

21:49.612 --> 21:51.919
- And emotionally shut down.
- Oh, is that right?

21:52.006 --> 21:54.487
Because of a trauma
in your past

21:54.574 --> 21:56.706
'that you've never
spoken of to anyone'

21:56.793 --> 21:58.404
ever, even yourself.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.802
Sorry. I was just
thinking out loud.

22:08.196 --> 22:10.590
What? I wasn't listening.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.113
What's his name?

22:12.200 --> 22:13.984
- Dan.
- Dan?

22:14.071 --> 22:15.246
Can I meet him?

22:15.334 --> 22:16.770
If you like.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.162
And, I would.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.339
Here's your client list.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.863
'I'll run it against
the Lynch-Halstead records.'

22:22.950 --> 22:24.908
[keyboard clicking]

22:27.171 --> 22:28.869
One match.

22:28.956 --> 22:33.482
You both shared a client
a long time ago, Carol Gentry?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.223
Carol Gentry.

22:42.839 --> 22:43.927
She forgives you, Carol.

22:46.843 --> 22:49.498
Your mother...
truly forgives you.

22:52.545 --> 22:55.025
I don't understand,
Mr. Jane.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.592
She forgives me?

22:56.679 --> 22:58.681
Yes.

22:58.768 --> 23:02.555
That's what she says.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.470
And I believe it
to be sincere.

23:06.646 --> 23:11.128
She was a vicious,
evil, abusive woman

23:11.215 --> 23:15.002
but I loved her...and cared
for her like a good daughter.

23:15.089 --> 23:18.527
What did I ever do, that
she should forgive me for?

23:28.798 --> 23:31.584
It's a hard truth, Carol..

23:31.671 --> 23:35.109
...but people don't change
when they pass on.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.807
They simply become
the essence of who they are.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.896
Your mother...
was a very complicated woman--

23:39.983 --> 23:42.377
She forgives me?

23:42.464 --> 23:45.293
That lunaticbitch
forgivesme?

23:45.380 --> 23:47.077
People are very
complicated.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.690
Aren't they?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.916
I'm afraid, that's all we
have time for this week.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.137
Oh.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.271
Okay. Yeah.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.838
I'm sorry. I just--

24:08.925 --> 24:10.449
It's okay.

24:10.536 --> 24:11.841
Just breathe.

24:11.928 --> 24:14.148
[inhales deeply]

24:17.412 --> 24:19.458
We'll talk more about this
next time, shall we?

24:19.545 --> 24:20.850
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.548
Okay.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.642
- Thank you, Mr. Jane.
- Thank you.

24:36.605 --> 24:38.259
[instrumental music]

25:08.463 --> 25:10.509
Jane?
Are you alright?

25:13.686 --> 25:15.818
Jane? Are you alright?

25:15.905 --> 25:18.429
Yeah, yeah. Uh,
I-I'm fine.

25:19.866 --> 25:21.607
I'm fine.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.266
[grunts]

25:29.353 --> 25:31.138
Jane!

25:31.225 --> 25:32.182
Jane?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.101
- Is he alright?
- Yeah.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.626
Oh, I'm 100% okay.
No need to send me back.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.453
Sir, he needs to be
in the hospital.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.412
He has to go,
if you order him to.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.676
I could, but someone did try
to kill him, remember?

25:47.763 --> 25:51.071
We can protect him better
here...at less expense.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.377
- Thanks, Virgil.
- Okay.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.554
But, this is a favor.
If you die in this department

25:55.641 --> 25:59.079
I'm responsible,
I do all the paperwork.

25:59.166 --> 26:00.689
In fact, if he does die
for whatever reason

26:00.776 --> 26:03.213
move him to a public area,
would you?

26:03.300 --> 26:04.780
I'd be very grateful.

26:04.867 --> 26:05.955
I hope he's smiling.

26:06.042 --> 26:07.435
Places tobe!

26:07.522 --> 26:09.698
Don't we all.

26:09.785 --> 26:11.439
Uh.

26:11.526 --> 26:13.876
Uh, a little help here?

26:17.488 --> 26:20.579
Just the stick.
Just the stick.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.320
Thank you.

26:23.407 --> 26:24.844
[sighs]

26:27.368 --> 26:30.066
We started doing research on
your old client, Carol Gentry.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.807
She's not a suspect.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.113
Lynch-Halstead were her
brokerage firm for a while.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.158
Just a coincidence.
She's not a suspect.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.856
How can you be so sure?

26:36.943 --> 26:38.814
Carol Gentry killed herself,
eight years ago.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.382
She left no family.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.256
You all still here?

26:46.343 --> 26:48.563
We're all here.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.956
[Jane]
'Good.'

26:50.043 --> 26:51.653
So back to square one,
I guess?

26:51.740 --> 26:54.961
Not quite. Van Pelt's done
some deeper research.

26:55.048 --> 26:56.527
[Lisbon]
'We cross-checked
the spouse's names'

26:56.615 --> 26:58.138
and came up with
a second hit.

26:58.225 --> 26:59.618
You used to have a client,
named, Jill Lamont.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.271
Her husband was
Paul Krager

27:01.358 --> 27:03.839
and he used to work
for Lynch-Halstead.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.580
Jill Lamont?

27:07.538 --> 27:09.105
Yes.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.023
Tell me more about your
husband, just anything.

27:16.156 --> 27:20.029
[sighs]
he loves me,
loves our son.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.772
Family is everything
to him.

27:23.859 --> 27:26.819
But, I've noticed
...a change..

27:26.906 --> 27:28.690
'...lately.'

27:33.782 --> 27:35.436
What sort of a change?

27:35.523 --> 27:37.133
He seems, uh..

27:37.220 --> 27:39.092
'...preoccupied.'

27:39.179 --> 27:40.746
And that's when you
began to wonder

27:40.833 --> 27:43.009
if he was being unfaithful?

27:43.096 --> 27:45.620
- That's right.
- Alright.

27:50.364 --> 27:51.321
[exhales deeply]

27:52.583 --> 27:54.673
Something's coming through.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.806
[exhales deeply]

27:57.893 --> 27:59.590
Feel it with me.

28:01.070 --> 28:03.899
Here.

28:03.986 --> 28:06.075
[exhales deeply]

28:07.424 --> 28:09.035
Yes, I'm feeling
that Paul hasn't been

28:09.122 --> 28:11.690
100% honest with you.

28:13.822 --> 28:15.868
'He hasn't been happy.'

28:18.218 --> 28:20.133
'You know that, don't you?'

28:23.832 --> 28:25.660
'Yes.'

28:25.747 --> 28:28.837
Do you sense someone else
in his life?

28:28.924 --> 28:32.145
- Your senses never lie.
- Yes.

28:32.232 --> 28:35.670
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.367
There's someone else.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.326
Is he leaving me?

28:39.413 --> 28:41.894
You have to talk to him, Jill.

28:41.981 --> 28:43.634
'You have to tell Paul'

28:43.722 --> 28:46.246
not to ruin
what you have together.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.946
Paul Krager's a name
I haven't heard in a while.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.643
It never even entered my mind.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.124
What do you know about
his personal life?

28:55.211 --> 28:57.344
We've all made our mistakes
over the years.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.825
Fat wallets and good wine
can do that to a man.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.304
You're referring
to his divorce?

29:01.391 --> 29:03.654
No, that was no divorce.
That was amassacre.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.047
His wife remarried, I think.

29:05.134 --> 29:07.397
But Krager's whole world
fell apart.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.965
Work-wise, he never recovered.
Went off the rails, to be frank.

29:10.052 --> 29:10.966
We had to let him go.

29:11.053 --> 29:13.012
Who actually did
the firing?

29:13.099 --> 29:15.449
Now, that you mention
it, Jimmy Medina did.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.277
Jim did a lot of
the axe-work here.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.713
Unfortunate part of the job.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.715
Any idea where we can
find Krager now?

29:20.802 --> 29:23.457
Last I heard, someone saw him
at a church soup kitchen

29:23.544 --> 29:25.415
during the holidays.

29:25.502 --> 29:27.983
There but for the grace of
God, if you know what I mean?

29:33.423 --> 29:34.903
[Rigsby]
'Well, Lynch was right.'

29:34.990 --> 29:37.210
The legal fees alone
nearly bankrupted Krager.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.255
His wife took their son,
moved east and remarried.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.779
So, where's Krager now?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.606
Well, based on we could find,
he was so devastated

29:42.693 --> 29:44.695
losing his family,
his whole world collapsed.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.088
No permanent address.

29:46.175 --> 29:48.047
He hasn't filed
a tax return in years.

29:48.134 --> 29:51.137
His last known employer
was Lynch-Halstead in 2001.

29:51.224 --> 29:53.008
Oh, you really did
a number on him.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.880
Yes, I did.
Thank you.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.666
No, you simply confirmed what
she knew in her heart already.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.973
Has anyone tried
contacting her? Jill Lamont?

30:01.060 --> 30:02.583
Yeah, I left word.
No answer yet.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.237
I put an APB out
on Paul Krager.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.413
Cho and I are gonna
follow up on some leads.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.632
You stay right there.

30:08.719 --> 30:12.549
Nobody take him anywhere.
No excitement whatsoever. Clear?

30:12.636 --> 30:13.855
- Clear, boss.
- Clear, boss.

30:13.942 --> 30:15.857
Crystal.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.598
Did you see how many
clients Jane had?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.339
Well, I guess he helped
a lot of people.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.384
I'm not so sure.

30:25.606 --> 30:26.955
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

30:28.914 --> 30:30.829
- Dan. Hey.
- Hi.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.832
Hi. What are you doing here?

30:33.919 --> 30:35.659
I was...at another
meeting upstairs

30:35.746 --> 30:38.314
thought I'd stop
by and say hello.

30:38.401 --> 30:41.143
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, totally.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.929
You know, it's just
a surprise, that's all.

30:44.016 --> 30:47.193
So, uh...introduce me
to your colleague

30:47.280 --> 30:49.021
who keeps staring at me
so strangely.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.936
[chuckles]
Yeah.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.982
Uh...Agent Rigsby?

30:54.069 --> 30:56.289
This is my friend,
Dan Hollenbeck.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.553
- Good to meet you.
- Hi. How you doing?

30:59.640 --> 31:01.120
Uh, I'm excellent. And you?

31:01.207 --> 31:02.338
Good. Yeah.

31:02.425 --> 31:05.254
- Okay, so..
- Lawyer, are you?

31:05.341 --> 31:06.734
I am.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.607
I'm sorry...do we
have a problem?

31:10.694 --> 31:14.089
No. No problem. It takes
all sorts, even lawyers.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.395
Okay, that's enough.

31:15.482 --> 31:17.397
Pleasure to get to know you,
Agent Rigsby.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.661
Can we..

31:20.748 --> 31:23.098
Can we be somewhere
private for a moment?

31:23.185 --> 31:24.708
Uh...I don't know
if that's such a..

31:24.795 --> 31:27.015
- Please.
- ...good idea.

31:27.102 --> 31:29.365
You know what? I'm sorry.
You and me do have a problem.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.976
Not a big one,
but we do need to talk.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.761
- No trouble, I swear.
- Alright, then.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.894
- No, it is notalright.
- No trouble. I promise.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.113
It's okay, Grace.
It's fine.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.419
Okay.

31:47.644 --> 31:48.950
So here we are.

31:49.037 --> 31:52.171
- Talk away.
- I don't know you, Dan.

31:52.258 --> 31:55.783
Maybe you're a nice guy.
I hope so. I don't know.

31:55.870 --> 31:57.176
Because if you
ever hurt Grace Van Pelt

31:57.263 --> 31:58.786
I will find you
and I will cause you pain

31:58.873 --> 32:01.136
because she means a lot
to...to the unit.

32:02.790 --> 32:05.836
- So you treat her right, okay?
- Yeah, I hear you.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.664
I appreciate your concern.

32:07.751 --> 32:11.538
You care for Grace.
Don't worry. I'm a..

32:11.625 --> 32:14.280
I'm a nice guy.

32:14.367 --> 32:16.021
Okay.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.588
Hey, uh, I'm sorry
to get heavy with you.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.373
I had to say it, you know?

32:20.460 --> 32:21.548
Just so long as
we understand each other.

32:21.635 --> 32:22.941
Yeah, sure thing.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.943
I understand. I do.

32:27.293 --> 32:28.947
[grunting]

32:44.919 --> 32:47.443
[dramatic music]

33:00.848 --> 33:02.589
[music continues]

33:16.559 --> 33:18.909
I am so embarrassed.
What did Rigsby say to you?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.520
No call for embarrassment.

33:20.607 --> 33:23.610
He's a good-hearted person.
I like him.

33:23.697 --> 33:26.482
He just wants you
to be happy...or else..

33:26.569 --> 33:28.180
And what did you say?

33:28.267 --> 33:29.964
Hmm. Well, I'd say
I do my best.

33:30.051 --> 33:32.749
- You did?
- I did.

33:32.836 --> 33:35.317
Hey, where is this psychic
character you told me about?

33:35.404 --> 33:37.667
- I'm dying to meet him.
- He wanted to meet you too.

33:48.852 --> 33:49.810
Jane?

33:49.897 --> 33:51.072
[gasps]

33:52.247 --> 33:53.814
[sighs]

33:55.468 --> 33:57.426
[Jane groans]

34:01.387 --> 34:03.171
- Damn.
- Sorry.

34:03.258 --> 34:04.651
I didn't know whether
to wake you or not.

34:04.738 --> 34:06.435
I'm awake.

34:06.522 --> 34:08.785
You said you wanted to meet
the man I've been dating.

34:08.872 --> 34:11.223
- Yeah. Is he coming?
- He's here.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.790
Here? Here now?

34:13.877 --> 34:15.053
Yes.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.402
Right here.

34:16.489 --> 34:18.621
- Oh.
- Dan Hollenbeck, sir.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.188
It's a real pleasure
to meet you.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.972
Grace has told me
so much about you.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.280
Good to meet you too, Dan.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.803
Excuse my asking,
but are you..

34:26.890 --> 34:28.849
Blind? Yes, as a bat.

34:28.936 --> 34:31.112
Temporarily blind.
Think positive.

34:31.199 --> 34:34.072
Yes, positive.
That's right.

34:34.159 --> 34:37.292
So, Van Pelt, uh,
where is Rigsby exactly?

34:37.379 --> 34:39.860
I don't know. Out getting
pizza, if I know Rigsby.

34:39.947 --> 34:41.035
You need him for something?

34:41.122 --> 34:42.297
Lisbon? Cho?

34:42.384 --> 34:44.952
Still chasing down
Paul Krager.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.650
- 'Nobody here but us.'
- Of course.

34:47.737 --> 34:50.740
So, Dan, quite the hard grip
you have there.

34:50.827 --> 34:53.003
Working man's hands.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.745
That, uh, faint scent
of chemicals

34:55.832 --> 34:58.574
but an expensive
Italian suit. It's interesting.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.185
Dan's a lawyer.

35:00.272 --> 35:02.665
A very junior lawyer.
I lobby the state senate.

35:02.752 --> 35:04.276
But you're good
with your hands.

35:04.363 --> 35:06.756
You're good at building things
as a hobby, maybe.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.497
I guess.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.804
What sort of things
do you build as a hobby?

35:10.891 --> 35:14.024
You know...stuff.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.983
And your parents?
Where are they?

35:18.203 --> 35:19.508
They're dead.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.946
Sorry to be a busybody.

35:23.033 --> 35:25.123
I just wanna be sure Grace
finds the right young man.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.213
- Mm.
- Hush.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.041
Well, I'm hungry, I guess I'll
get myself something to eat.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.434
Don't be silly.
I'll get you something.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.654
No, no, no. I...it's okay.
I can manage.

35:34.741 --> 35:36.569
[whispers]
You think I'm dumb?

35:36.656 --> 35:38.614
Make the wrong move
and I'll shoot her in the head.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.834
I hear you.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.401
What are you guys
whispering about?

35:42.488 --> 35:44.881
Nothing.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.449
- Some chips would be nice.
- What kind?

35:47.536 --> 35:48.711
I'm easy.

35:48.798 --> 35:51.061
[cellphone ringing]

35:52.933 --> 35:54.587
[Grace]
'It's the boss.'

35:56.328 --> 35:57.938
[Lisbon on phone]
'Looks like we've cracked it.'

35:58.025 --> 35:59.809
We found Paul Krager.

35:59.896 --> 36:02.551
He was obsessed
with Jane and Medina.

36:02.638 --> 36:04.553
[Lisbon]
'Remember he has a son?'

36:04.640 --> 36:06.686
'Well, Krager told us
he's living in the city now.'

36:06.773 --> 36:10.733
'He goes by the name,
Dan Hollenbeck.'

36:10.820 --> 36:11.952
'Van Pelt?'

36:15.173 --> 36:17.131
- Sorry about this.
- 'Van Pelt?'

36:20.047 --> 36:21.918
That was weird.

36:24.007 --> 36:25.574
I don't understand.

36:25.661 --> 36:27.315
'He's the bomber.'

36:27.402 --> 36:29.491
He killed James Medina,
now he's come to kill me.

36:31.624 --> 36:33.495
Don't even think about it.

36:40.676 --> 36:44.071
I'm sorry I had
to lie to you, Grace. Truly.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.986
- But I needed you.
- Why?

36:46.073 --> 36:48.771
To access the statehouse lot.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.338
He used your security pass.

36:50.425 --> 36:52.601
You son of a bitch.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.082
Just be cool, Van Pelt.
Please, be cool.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.477
Grace, relax.
I've no desire to hurt you.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.479
Give it up, Dan, please?

37:02.002 --> 37:05.484
I'm in too deep.
I can't stop now.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.137
Don't make me hurt you.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.749
Just do as he says.

37:11.272 --> 37:14.275
Oh, you're a nice guy now,
aren't you?

37:16.973 --> 37:19.976
You destroyed my life...
for what?

37:20.063 --> 37:21.891
Because my dad cheated
on my mom?

37:21.978 --> 37:24.329
Big deal.
He wasn't perfect.

37:24.416 --> 37:25.982
And for that,
he's on the street.

37:26.069 --> 37:27.941
'He loses everything!'

37:28.028 --> 37:29.377
'One day, I'm at the best'

37:29.464 --> 37:31.379
the best private school
in Los Angeles.

37:31.466 --> 37:34.121
I'm playing soccer
with movie stars' kids.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.602
Next minute,
I'm in Dogpatch, New Jersey

37:36.689 --> 37:38.734
'with my weeping mom,
getting my ass whipped'

37:38.821 --> 37:41.389
by thugs that don't even
speak freaking English.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.391
Why?

37:43.478 --> 37:46.829
Because you...you had
to be the man who knows.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.354
'You hadto tell my mom
the truth.'

37:49.441 --> 37:50.703
I'm sorry, Dan.

37:50.790 --> 37:52.879
Yeah, sure you are,
with a gun at your back.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.534
Take out your handcuffs.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.192
Handcuff yourself.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.977
[handcuffs click]

38:04.064 --> 38:06.196
Behind the back.
Drop the cane.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.241
[cane clanks]

38:07.328 --> 38:09.374
Okay. Here we go.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.593
[handcuffs click]

38:11.680 --> 38:13.726
- Let's go.
- Where are we going?

38:13.813 --> 38:16.468
Somewhere quiet and private.
You won't like it.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.904
Oh.

38:17.991 --> 38:19.862
Where's your car, Grace?

38:19.949 --> 38:23.475
In the side parking lot.
A jeep, Iowa plates.

38:23.562 --> 38:24.998
I didn't know
you were from Iowa.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.826
Famous potatoes, huh?

38:26.913 --> 38:29.176
That's Idaho,
you ignorant jerk.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.831
Oh, yeah?
What's Iowa famous for?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.876
Gullible women.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.791
- That's not fair.
- Keep moving.

38:35.878 --> 38:37.053
[lock clanking]

38:44.931 --> 38:46.149
Oh.

38:46.236 --> 38:47.977
[chain rattling]

38:51.285 --> 38:52.547
Ah, Tommy, you still here?

38:52.634 --> 38:55.071
Hey, Mr. Jane.
Uh, just locking up.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.464
You folks need anything?

38:56.551 --> 38:57.770
Uh..

38:57.857 --> 38:59.989
- Argh!
- Run! Run, Grace.

39:01.861 --> 39:02.818
Freeze!

39:02.905 --> 39:04.994
[gunshots]

39:05.081 --> 39:07.562
[grunts]

39:07.649 --> 39:09.651
[dramatic music]

39:13.786 --> 39:17.311
Ah!

39:17.398 --> 39:19.269
Hey, go to the right,
the right.

39:21.141 --> 39:22.838
Okay, you're gonna
take this to your car.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.884
- But I can't drive.
- We'll manage. Keys, keys.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.929
Alright, in-in the,
my left front pants p-pocket.

39:27.016 --> 39:29.105
Sorry. Oh, oh.

39:29.192 --> 39:30.803
- Uh, got it.
- Okay. Okay.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.892
- Let's go.
- Okay.

39:32.979 --> 39:34.676
Okay, the jeep's on the right.
On the right.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.374
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.723
Okay.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.289
Okay, there's the handle.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.769
[keys jingling]

39:44.556 --> 39:46.122
You in, Grace?

39:46.209 --> 39:47.733
- Grace, you in?
- Hang on, hang on.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.082
Okay, on the dash
or on the column?

39:49.169 --> 39:50.823
On the, on the column.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.259
Up. Up.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.347
- Yeah.
- Okay. Up.

39:54.870 --> 39:56.437
[engine revving]

40:02.574 --> 40:04.663
Alright, that's-that's reverse.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.404
- Good? All-all clear?
- Back it up.

40:06.491 --> 40:07.535
'Yeah, slow.'

40:07.622 --> 40:09.232
- Slow.
- Slowly.

40:09.319 --> 40:12.322
- Slowly backing. Slowly.
- Okay, slow, slow, slow.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.498
Oh.

40:13.585 --> 40:14.542
[car alarm blaring]

40:14.629 --> 40:15.935
'Sorry about that.'

40:16.022 --> 40:17.415
[engine revving]

40:20.853 --> 40:22.550
- Straight.
- Okay, I got it. Got it.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.117
[tires screeching]

40:24.204 --> 40:25.205
[gunshot]

40:25.292 --> 40:27.425
- 'Aah!'
- Ah, okay.

40:27.512 --> 40:28.904
Okay, straight, straight,
straight.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.211
Alright, now, you gotta
make a right. Turn right.

40:31.298 --> 40:32.691
No, no, not yet.
Not yet. Not yet.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.649
Aah! Aah!

40:34.736 --> 40:38.218
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.350
Punch it, punch it, punch it!
Turn right now!

40:40.438 --> 40:42.265
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

40:42.352 --> 40:44.920
Okay. Wait. Reverse,
reverse, reverse.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.663
- Ah!

Aah!

40:53.668 --> 40:55.148

- Come on, come on.
- Come on!

40:59.674 --> 41:02.460
'You put in in park,
put it in park.'

41:02.547 --> 41:04.505
- Start. I can't start.
- Oh! Jane, no!

41:11.033 --> 41:14.254
Oh! Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God!

41:14.341 --> 41:17.257
What? What happened?
Did something good happen?

41:17.344 --> 41:20.042
Didn't I say no excitement
of any kind?

41:27.572 --> 41:29.922
Oh. Oh, you're alive.

41:30.009 --> 41:31.619
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

41:31.706 --> 41:34.100
Yeah. It's no bother.
I'm fine.

41:34.187 --> 41:37.016
[sighs]

41:37.103 --> 41:38.670
[whispers]
I'm sorry.

It's alright. It's alright.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.075
[door opens]

41:53.162 --> 41:55.730
Oops. Sorry about that.

41:59.604 --> 42:03.912
I have an H746B form
to fill out. Yeah.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.487

Ow.

42:54.789 --> 42:56.574
[exhales]

43:13.416 --> 43:17.986
Oh, you have no notion how good
it is to see your face, Rigsby.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.684
Rigsby?

43:23.078 --> 43:24.993
Aah!

43:25.080 --> 43:27.692
[laughing]

43:27.779 --> 43:30.085
Huh? You're funny.

43:35.830 --> 43:38.703

Stay tuned for scenes
