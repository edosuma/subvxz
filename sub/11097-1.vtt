WEBVTT

00:28.111 --> 00:30.529
(Mandy) My world was divided
into two kingdoms.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.531
There was Camelot,

00:32.698 --> 00:35.117
and then there was where I lived.

00:35.618 --> 00:37.453
(Man) Stay behind the red line
until you are clear.

00:37.620 --> 00:38.620
(siren blaring)

00:38.788 --> 00:42.583
(Man) Only those with work visas
for Camelot will be allowed to pass.

00:43.293 --> 00:44.960
(Mandy) Which we call Nottingham,

00:45.128 --> 00:49.006
as in not gated, not rich,
not popular, not cool.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.466
They didn't let us into their kingdom

00:50.633 --> 00:53.635
and they'd rarely sully themselves
by venturing into ours.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.472
(  "That Stuff")

00:56.639 --> 00:58.390
On the day before my 18th birthday,

00:58.558 --> 01:00.809
a terrible thought drifted
into my head.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.728
What if I remained a crusty nobody

01:02.896 --> 01:05.313
for what little remained
of my high school life?

01:05.482 --> 01:08.650
My school's one of those
where at least 96% of the girls

01:08.818 --> 01:11.153
were in the hottie
or high hottie bracket,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.405
and most of the guys looked like

01:13.573 --> 01:16.742
they wandered out
of an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog.

01:18.536 --> 01:22.331
And then there is Drew Patterson.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.502
(sighs) I have been secretly in love
with him since seventh grade.

01:26.669 --> 01:30.172
All I wanted was for him
to just simply acknowledge me.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.258
To just say my name.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.053
(alarm ringing)

01:44.896 --> 01:46.355
But for that to happen,

01:46.523 --> 01:49.066
for me to finish this march through hell
they called high school

01:49.234 --> 01:52.361
and go out with style, I needed skills.

01:53.363 --> 01:56.698
I needed my Excalibur.

01:59.327 --> 02:02.329
(Woman) Information is power.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.997
(Mandy) The video phone.

02:04.165 --> 02:08.919
With such a weapon in hand, I mightjust
have a chance at becoming a somebody.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.255
There'sjust one hideous criminal
mastermind standing in my way.

02:11.422 --> 02:15.801
- (knock on door)
- Mandy, 7:22. Gonna be late.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.886
(Mandy) My mom died when I was four.

02:18.054 --> 02:22.224
And even though he loves me,
Dad had issues about letting go.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.102
(Tom) You want to make some kind of
noise so I know you're all right?

02:25.270 --> 02:27.062
- (coughs)
- Thanks.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.067
(  "Sincerely Me" playing on car radio)

02:40.243 --> 02:42.870
It's your birthday tomorrow, isn't it?

02:43.913 --> 02:45.414
Yeah.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.667
May have got a few surprises
up my sleeve.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.294
(cell phone ringing)

02:53.506 --> 02:54.715
- Hello?
- (Alexa) Mandy.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.924
(static)

02:56.092 --> 02:57.176
- Alexa?
- Yeah.

02:57.343 --> 02:58.510
What? Hello?

02:59.179 --> 03:01.180
- I can't hear you.
- What?

03:01.681 --> 03:03.265
OK, I can't talk now.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.060
- Dad.
- Yeah?

03:07.228 --> 03:09.688
I hope you know how much
I seriously need a new phone.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.941
- What?
- I can't even begin to scheme or spy

03:13.109 --> 03:17.321
or conspire like everyone else.
It's such a burn. I'm in high school.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.072
- I need survival skills.
- Kitten, I...

03:19.240 --> 03:21.700
I am socially handicapped
with this relic.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.952
I can't even send
or receive pictures or video.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.746
And can you possibly
stop calling me kitten?

03:25.914 --> 03:29.166
- What?
- I'm gonna be 18 years, not months.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.459
OK?

03:31.127 --> 03:32.461
(school bell ringing)

03:43.306 --> 03:47.434
Don't say it, don't say it, don't
say it, don't say it, don't say it.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.186
Bye, kitten.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.315
(Tom honking horn)

03:56.444 --> 03:57.527
(cell phone ringing)

04:00.323 --> 04:02.699
- Hello?
- Mandy?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.159
Cayenne.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.828
- Have you seen Drew yet?
- No, not yet.

04:06.996 --> 04:11.416
He must have been a great warrior
or a king in a past lifetime.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.418
I could write
a thousand songs about him

04:13.586 --> 04:16.004
and I'd just be scratching the surface.

04:17.130 --> 04:19.675
Mandy, he's right behind you.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.553
(boy) What's up, Drew?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.307
Good morning, Drew.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.309
Hey, there.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.356
Check it out.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.609
It's kind of cute in a pathetic way.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.571
Poor thing. Salivating over my Drew.

04:42.198 --> 04:45.617
So sad, knowing her whole life
she'll never know a hunk.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.453
- You're mine.
- (all exclaiming)

04:48.621 --> 04:52.541
I can't believe you did that.
Why didn't I think of it?

04:55.086 --> 04:57.754
(Lisa) Check it out,
granny panties up ahead.

04:58.339 --> 05:02.134
This is Lisa Cross reporting live
for the fashion challenged.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.595
- (laughing)
- Nice girdle, Granny.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.847
(  "Better")

05:07.015 --> 05:08.598
(cell phones ringing)

05:09.058 --> 05:13.020
So you'll keep remembering me

05:13.479 --> 05:16.231
Better take a look at what you had

05:16.399 --> 05:19.276
Better figure out
something the next time

05:19.444 --> 05:22.112
-   When you keep remembering me
- (bell ringing)

05:22.280 --> 05:26.158
Evil One's cruelty knows no bounds.
Your ass is on every phone in school.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.494
Forget about him, Mandy,
he's not only dating the Antichrist,

05:29.662 --> 05:33.957
but he's upper crust. And we are trying
to claw our way up to the middle-class.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.918
He lives in a gated community.

05:37.086 --> 05:39.338
We live in a dated community.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.091
Mandy, are you even listening to me?

05:43.259 --> 05:47.179
I don't care what you guys say.
I'm gonna get Drew to notice me.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.058
(whistle blowing)

05:52.727 --> 05:57.272
The swim team? That's your plan to get
the Adonis of high school to notice you?

05:57.440 --> 05:59.024
You look like a whole new species.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.443
Maybe someone from
the Discovery Channel will notice you.

06:01.611 --> 06:05.697
OK, the boys practice after sixth
period in pool one, the girls, pool two.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.948
It's at least a shot.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.116
(groans)

06:09.077 --> 06:11.286
I think you actually
enjoy being a klutz,

06:11.454 --> 06:15.207
because you know how much happiness
it brings to others.

07:11.180 --> 07:12.180
(heart beating)

07:24.026 --> 07:25.527
(coughing)

07:26.612 --> 07:28.196
(gasping)

07:30.032 --> 07:31.491
(echoing)
Are you all right, Mandy?

07:34.579 --> 07:38.081
My name. You said my name.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.337
Your hands...

07:44.964 --> 07:48.758
Though tingly, maybe inappropriately
placed while we're on school property.

07:49.218 --> 07:51.720
Right. (chuckles)

07:52.972 --> 07:55.223
I can't believe Drew
actually noticed me.

07:55.391 --> 07:56.600
You were dying. You were going

07:56.767 --> 07:58.768
- into the light at his feet.
- Well, it's a start.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.188
(cell phone ringing)

08:02.106 --> 08:05.233
- Hello?
- Tell Mandy to hide, Lisa's here.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.736
She's toxic. She'll put
a curse on her or something.

08:07.904 --> 08:10.822
In junior high,
I heard she made it rain toads.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.873
Alexa, what a pretty smock
and a name tag.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.083
(speaking French)
Very red state.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.960
Mandy's not here right now
in case you...

08:24.128 --> 08:25.629
I already saw her.

08:25.796 --> 08:29.424
You need to work on your lying.
It's a vital social skill.

08:30.134 --> 08:32.427
- Mandy.
- Hi.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.846
I didn't know frizzy hair was back in.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.347
Must be so humbling.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.850
Schlepping dog food around
for minimum wage.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.186
You are such an inspiration.

08:42.270 --> 08:44.439
Where are the dog collars?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.859
- (whispering) Drew lost his.
- Aisle four.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.406
You know what she's doing, don't you?

08:53.574 --> 08:56.910
She's trying to not so subtly show Drew
you're just a lowly shop girl.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.371
It's OK, I'm not ashamed
of being a shop girl.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.123
And caring for animals is not lowly.

09:05.169 --> 09:08.129
Sorry about Lisa
and her superiority complex.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.966
- How you feeling?
- Great.

09:11.133 --> 09:15.428
- Thanks again for saving my life.
- You're welcome.

09:17.723 --> 09:20.725
So, you've got a thing for animals?

09:21.519 --> 09:25.522
Yeah. Yeah, although Homo sapiens
can be difficult.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.984
I'm going to UCSB for zoology
and then I'm gonna be a vet.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.903
- How about you?
- USC, business school.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.865
The acorn doesn't fall far
from the tree and all that.

09:36.033 --> 09:40.370
- Cool, follow your dream and all that.
- It's not my dream.

09:41.372 --> 09:44.124
Maybe you can help me.
My cat Andy's been feeling really funky.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.168
Well, is his tummy
pouched out, bloated?

09:47.336 --> 09:51.172
Because if it is, he probably has worms.
You might want to try this.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.341
Six drops in every meal.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.804
Thanks, doc.
Maybe I'll see you around?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.514
Yeah, maybe.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.644
Where might you see me around,
around where?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.771
I don't know.

10:07.565 --> 10:10.066
The commons, tomorrow after school?

10:10.693 --> 10:11.943
See you.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.903
(  "All So Different")

10:17.825 --> 10:21.578
Freshman varsity football,
basketball, swim team.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.415
Voted best hair, best eyes, best kisser.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.712
(sighs) Drew Patterson
at the commons tomorrow.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.429
Who am I kidding?
I'm so not ready for this.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.475
(Tom) Mandy,
do you want some breakfast?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.271
(yawning)

10:50.024 --> 10:52.400
(  "Ode To Joy")

10:58.949 --> 11:00.575
(cell phone ringing)

11:13.589 --> 11:16.675
- Hello?
- Do you like it?

11:16.842 --> 11:20.220
- Are you kidding? I love it!
- Yeah, I got one, too.

11:20.388 --> 11:24.265
- Oh, my gosh. Thanks, Daddy.
- Happy birthday, kitten.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.560
Now we can stay in contact 24/7.
It's gonna be great, right?

11:27.728 --> 11:29.729
Yeah, yeah, it'll be cool.
Here, make a mean face.

11:31.023 --> 11:35.777
- You have your own special ring tone.
- All right, gift number two.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.154
Somebody, I think, asked for...

11:38.322 --> 11:40.448
Contacts? Oh, my gosh.
You have got to be kidding.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.450
(Tom laughing)

11:42.618 --> 11:46.162
Yes, I'm not sure why you need them.
You're already too beautiful.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.872
In fact, promise me
you're not gonna go hang out

11:48.040 --> 11:51.501
- with the delinquents at the lake.
- Dad. OK, I won't. I promise.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.878
I cannot wait
to show Alexa and Cayenne this.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.171
Oh, my gosh. Dad, you're the best.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.840
And I'm going to the commons
right after school.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.299
OK, OK. Hey, wait, wait, wait.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.470
There's one more birthday surprise,
perhaps the bestest.

12:03.472 --> 12:06.725
You know how you've been talking
about going away to school, right?

12:06.892 --> 12:10.228
Well, I think I may have found
the perfect compromise.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.857
I've been working on this for a
long time. It's a duplex in Ventura.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.651
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can commute
to UCSB. I can get to work.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.653
It's the same distance,
I'll show you on the computer.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.655
Anyways, I'm down here in this level

12:20.823 --> 12:24.075
and you have this whole top floor
to yourself.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.577
Huh?

12:27.204 --> 12:29.748
Boy. Those two apartments

12:29.915 --> 12:33.334
are so close.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.711
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.881
Just like you and me. It's perfect.

12:43.512 --> 12:45.305
Hey, kitten, don't forget to floss.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.474
(screaming)

12:48.642 --> 12:50.393
I couldn't very well tell him
that the concept was only

12:50.561 --> 12:52.979
slightly less terrifying
than being buried alive.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.857
Especially after he just bought me
this massively cool phone.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.277
You are officially out of the Stone Age.
You've evolved.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.530
So, the plan is we find a suitable place
for me to hang

13:02.698 --> 13:04.157
and be irresistibly alluring.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.284
And when we see him,
we casually blurt out,

13:06.452 --> 13:08.328
"We know where
a certain sex goddess is."

13:08.496 --> 13:10.455
Battle stations.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.082
- (waitress) Here you go.
- Thanks.

13:15.711 --> 13:19.756
(Cayenne) What if he's just playing her?
I mean, forgive me for feeling like

13:19.924 --> 13:23.885
some teenage male as fresh as Drew
might be a tad insincere,

13:24.053 --> 13:26.054
but I don't want Mandy to get hurt.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.140
And I keep schooling you,
listen to the songs.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.060
They tell all. People want to get hurt.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.480
They're just begging
to get their hearts broken.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.857
What's up? Have you guys seen Mandy?

13:38.609 --> 13:40.819
Oh. Um...

13:41.737 --> 13:43.905
Hi, Drew.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.365
(cell phone ringing)

13:47.743 --> 13:48.993
- (Alexa) Mandy?
- Yeah.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.834
Alexa, speak. Use your words.

13:59.171 --> 14:03.550
- At Jalapeno's.
- Jalapeno's, great. Thanks.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.093
Smile.

14:06.387 --> 14:07.470
Yes.

14:10.057 --> 14:12.267
Oh, my God. (panting)

14:12.434 --> 14:16.771
Oh, my God. Mouth's burning. I need
water, I need water. I need water!

14:20.526 --> 14:24.404
Guzzling right from the bev bar.
That is so Hercules.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.365
- (chuckling)
- Yes.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.243
Well, we all have our special talents.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.788
Do you want a drink?
I could get you a beverage receptacle.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.039
(  "You Are Part of Everything")

14:35.207 --> 14:38.710
A cup would be awesome. Thanks.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.672
You know something funny?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.632
Some guys actually try out
for the boys' team,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.676
'cause the girls practice
in the pool next door.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.137
They think they'll notice them
or something.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.681
(laughs) Wow.

14:51.849 --> 14:55.310
That's a really doofus move. Lame.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.439
- I like your laugh.
- Thanks.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.816
God, Lisa hardly ever laughs.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.569
She's got a burning scream, though.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.155
And when does she...

15:07.323 --> 15:09.157
I mean, how do you know?

15:11.493 --> 15:12.744
Oh! Uh...

15:12.912 --> 15:16.456
Delete that, I so don't want
to know unsavory details.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.334
Scary movies.
She screams at scary movies.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.086
Scary movies. Duh.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.840
- The new video phone?
- Yeah.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.720
Wow. Who's this scary dude?

15:30.888 --> 15:33.640
- That's my dad.
- Wow. OK.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.017
- Big Father's watching you.
- Yeah.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.771
Look, do you want to hang out?

15:41.023 --> 15:42.482
Well, what about Lisa?

15:43.484 --> 15:46.569
Lisa doesn't own me.
She just thinks she does.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.281
We're having a kick-back.
Meet me at the lake in 20?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.909
Sure, 20.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.204
At the lake.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.706
- Hello.
- Hey, sis.

15:59.708 --> 16:02.293
Hey, Peyton. How you doing, buddy?

16:02.461 --> 16:05.046
Good to... Why does he run
to the other room every single time?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.674
Because he knows you, you know.
Children sense things.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.803
And he senses that you're so busy being
controlling and overbearing with Mandy,

16:11.971 --> 16:14.555
you don't have time to bond
with your own nephew.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.100
I think that's unfair and judgmental.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.560
You know,
once Mandy goes off to college,

16:19.728 --> 16:21.729
you won't be needing stuff in bulk
like this anymore,

16:21.897 --> 16:25.024
but you mightjust need a certain
nephew to help you fill the void.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.735
There's not gonna be a void. Oh, no.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.572
Perhaps you haven't really embraced
the concept of the plex.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.117
You see,
and let me explain this again...

16:34.284 --> 16:37.161
God, you can't be serious
about this duplex thing.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.163
I'm very serious. And look at this.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.749
I got one for Mandy and myself.
We each have one.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.876
So no matter where she goes,
no matter what she does,

16:44.044 --> 16:47.463
no matter who she's doing it with,
I'm right there with her the whole time.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.673
How genius is that?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.926
- And you think that's a good thing?
- Yeah.

16:52.094 --> 16:56.097
God, she's not a little girl anymore,
she's a woman, Tom.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.932
- Yeah.
- This is the time where you need to

16:58.100 --> 17:01.644
- learn to let go, not hold on tighter.
- I know that.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.563
What, you think I don't know that?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.025
No, you don't.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.653
(  "Day in the Sun")

17:11.905 --> 17:15.491
Just having fun with my day in the sun

17:15.659 --> 17:19.037
Taking offwith the wind in my hair

17:19.954 --> 17:22.290
Make no plans, I have no...

17:22.458 --> 17:24.459
(girl chattering on cell phone)

17:24.626 --> 17:27.295
- Hey, have you seen Drew?
- Do you mind?

17:28.380 --> 17:31.466
Sorry, I can't hear you.
Some idiot's talking to me.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.639
(cell phone ringing)

17:41.977 --> 17:45.813
- Hey, where are you?
- To your left, I'll come to you.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.072
(exclaims)

17:54.239 --> 17:57.075
It's time to take
the training wheels off, kiddo.

18:02.998 --> 18:03.998
Hey.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.169
Oh!

18:11.423 --> 18:13.132
Lisa, sweetie.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.594
We have a serious 91 1 situation
on our hands.

18:17.846 --> 18:18.888
(screaming)

18:19.056 --> 18:20.139
(  "Unstoppable")

18:20.307 --> 18:21.724
(tires squealing)

18:22.643 --> 18:26.229
That's me, I'm unstoppable

18:27.689 --> 18:30.149
I've been wanting to ask you something.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.861
Why did you want to hang out with me?

18:34.029 --> 18:38.157
- I'm not really one of you people.
- You people? Ouch!

18:38.325 --> 18:42.078
No, no, no.
I just meant, objectively speaking.

18:42.746 --> 18:45.248
I'm not really your type,
you know, whatsoever.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.209
I'm not exactly
a prom queen or anything.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.294
Well,

18:50.462 --> 18:53.422
maybe I dig you because
you're not like everybody else.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.551
And I feel like I can
be myself around you.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.138
And I like your eyes.

19:01.682 --> 19:02.765
And...

19:03.892 --> 19:07.645
Does a guy really have to explain
why he thinks a girl's hot?

19:09.439 --> 19:12.900
- You think I'm hot?
- Totally.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.718
I swear I'm gonna hurl.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.094
(ringing)

19:43.557 --> 19:46.142
I think it's Mandy's. She dropped it.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.524
And that looks like a parental unit.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.695
Hello? Who am I speaking to?

19:57.863 --> 20:00.823
This is Mandy's father.
Who am I speaking to?

20:01.491 --> 20:03.993
It's Mandy's father.

20:04.161 --> 20:09.498
Well, you're in luck. I think your
little angel's around here somewhere.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.920
Mandy, it's for you, sweetie.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.089
(gasps) No!

20:21.303 --> 20:25.389
(Tom) Hello, Mandy?
Hello? Mandy, hello?

20:25.557 --> 20:28.726
- Dad?
- Yeah, hi. Where are you?

20:28.894 --> 20:31.312
Uh...

20:31.480 --> 20:35.149
- The commons.
- Really? Show me.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.112
- Excuse me?
- Mandy, I need you to show me

20:40.280 --> 20:43.407
a picture with your phone
of the commons.

20:43.575 --> 20:44.659
Now.

20:57.589 --> 20:58.589
(Alexa) Hi.

21:01.385 --> 21:06.013
I love what they've done with the place.
I'll see you at home in ten minutes.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.727
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

21:11.895 --> 21:15.189
Sorry, I have to go.
It was really nice knowing you.

21:15.691 --> 21:19.151
- I hope you can make it to my funeral.
- Wait. Look.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.112
Saturday night, I'm having this party

21:21.280 --> 21:24.031
and I was wondering
if you wanted to come.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.033
I'll leave your name at the gate.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.664
- Wait, are you...
- Asking you out?

21:31.832 --> 21:35.918
Yes. Mandy, will you go out with me?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.298
To your party?

21:40.465 --> 21:44.510
I mean, the biggest, most glamorous,
important party of the year?

21:45.554 --> 21:46.887
- Me?
- Yeah.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.848
- With you?
- Yeah.

21:49.016 --> 21:52.601
So you'll come?
I mean, what could possibly stop you?

21:55.022 --> 21:55.813
You're grounded.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.900
No! No, no, no. Dad, Dad, Dad. Wait.
OK. You don't understand.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.987
I can't be grounded, OK?
OK, do you not get it?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.739
Dad, he is like
the hottest guy in school

22:04.906 --> 22:07.700
and he asked me to his party
this weekend, Dad.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.244
Dad, it is Drew Patterson.

22:10.996 --> 22:15.166
Drew Patterson, right. He's the rabid
primate that was groping you.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.628
It's amazing how you can watch
these videos over and over and over.

22:19.796 --> 22:22.089
- Dad, we are not bonding here.
- The problem, Mandy,

22:22.257 --> 22:24.884
is that this is just another example
of how you don't listen.

22:25.052 --> 22:28.054
As a matter of fact,
you're double-grounded.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.264
- Double-grounded?
- I'm sorry, did I say double?

22:30.432 --> 22:33.851
- 'Cause I meant triple.
- Triple-grounded?

22:34.019 --> 22:37.563
Yeah, 'cause you can't go out, you can't
use your phone and you can't watch TV.

22:37.731 --> 22:40.900
- Or use your computer.
- That's four things.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.985
Shall we go for five?

22:52.454 --> 22:55.498
(Mandy) Trapped,
a prisoner in my own home.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.878
The only thing that keeps me going
is the dream.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.590
Call me.

23:06.343 --> 23:09.261
- (gasps)
- Mandy, you want some breakfast?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.891
Just slide it under the door
like all the other prisoners.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.852
(cell phone buzzing)

23:22.984 --> 23:25.361
What's that noise?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.988
My electric tooth brush.

23:28.949 --> 23:32.201
- I'm brushing my teeth.
- Mmm-hmm.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.330
- Hi.
- Hey, the drops worked.

23:36.498 --> 23:39.500
My cat Andy is totally cool now, thanks.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.336
Check out my page on the
Living Scrapbook website, OK?

23:42.504 --> 23:44.797
- Sure.
- You are coming tonight, aren't you?

23:45.674 --> 23:48.050
Of course you are.
I'm gonna grab some sick music.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.344
- I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.020
Undeclared?

24:01.940 --> 24:02.982
(screams)

24:05.777 --> 24:08.446
You all right? I'm not deaf, you know.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.991
I hear sounds.
Conversations on the phone.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.786
Grounded, come on.

24:15.954 --> 24:16.912
Kitten.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.457
Dad, is it possible that
you're overreacting

24:19.624 --> 24:23.752
with far too much aggression
to such a minor transgression?

24:24.004 --> 24:25.463
(phone ringing)

24:26.423 --> 24:27.882
Hello?

24:28.049 --> 24:30.342
Why, no, Alexa, she can't speak
with you because she's grounded.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.052
Not sure you got the memo.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.264
- No, I'm not insane.
- Yes, you are.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.808
No, no, I'm sure it's an emergency.
It's just that she's grounded.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.268
That's why she can't talk to you.

24:40.770 --> 24:45.608
Yeah, when you don't listen.
I'll take this, Miss Consequences.

24:45.775 --> 24:49.236
Breakfast, on the other hand,
is out here, in case you want it.

24:49.404 --> 24:50.404
(door closing)

24:52.407 --> 24:56.285
Grounded. I can't believe I'm grounded.

24:56.453 --> 24:57.786
(sighing)

24:59.247 --> 25:01.207
What am I going to do?

25:04.252 --> 25:05.753
I need a sign.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.217
My Magic 8-Ball.

25:15.388 --> 25:18.974
Magic 8-Ball, keeper of all wisdom,

25:19.142 --> 25:21.477
speak to me in my time of need.

25:22.729 --> 25:26.273
I've heard the siren song
of a hot teenage male.

25:27.400 --> 25:32.571
Is it my destiny to boldly venture forth
to this party tonight?

25:39.120 --> 25:41.288
Let me try that again.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.559
But, of course.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.019
(  "Because I'm Awesome")

26:04.729 --> 26:06.522
And I'll beat you

26:06.690 --> 26:08.190
'Cause I'm awesome

26:08.358 --> 26:11.902
-   I'm a leader, I'm a winner
-   I'm a leader, I'm a winner

26:12.070 --> 26:13.612
-   And I'm cleaner
-   And I'm cleaner

26:13.780 --> 26:15.447
-   'Cause I'm awesome
-   'Cause I'm awesome

26:15.615 --> 26:16.991
-   I don't need you
-   I don't need you

26:17.158 --> 26:18.701
-   'Cause I'm neat-o
-   'Cause I'm neat-o

26:18.868 --> 26:20.452
-   And I'll beat you
-   And I'll beat you

26:20.620 --> 26:23.497
'Cause I'm awesome, uh-huh

26:26.418 --> 26:29.878
- Dad, I was just wondering...
- The answer's no.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.464
Fine.

26:32.632 --> 26:36.552
I guess there is a first time
for everything. Even a D minus.

26:36.720 --> 26:40.055
- I'm sorry, what?
- Oh.

26:40.223 --> 26:42.433
- Now he listens.
- Yeah.

26:42.601 --> 26:46.687
OK, Dad. I have a totally for-real
legitimate homework crisis.

26:46.855 --> 26:49.106
I have to go to Alexa's house
to study history and econ.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.734
- We have finals.
- So you expect me to believe

26:51.901 --> 26:55.696
that on the night of this
wildly important party,

26:55.864 --> 26:59.366
you're gonna go out,
but you're gonna study at Alexa's.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.286
When life hands me a lemon,

27:02.454 --> 27:05.205
that's you, I make lemonade,

27:05.373 --> 27:08.167
by studying hard, so I can get
good grades to get into a good school

27:08.335 --> 27:11.003
and become
a productive member of society.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.589
Yeah, the lemon's not
really buying that.

27:17.719 --> 27:20.804
It's fine. I understand.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.057
You don't trust me.

27:23.224 --> 27:27.728
And even though that eviscerates
my very well-being, it's fine.

27:27.896 --> 27:31.857
I'll just stay here
and wallow in despair.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.401
Probably scar myself for life,
but don't worry, OK?

27:34.569 --> 27:36.737
- No.
- I'm sure eventually, I'll forgive you,

27:36.905 --> 27:39.573
by the time
you start collecting Social Security.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.159
But seriously, I have to study.

27:43.495 --> 27:47.206
Let me ask you this,
will Alexa's mom be there?

27:47.374 --> 27:48.582
Yes.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.418
So we'd have genuine authentic
adult supervision.

27:52.962 --> 27:55.255
All right, I'm gonna say OK.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.133
But there are some rules.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.887
First of all, you can have your
phone back. That's exciting.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.181
But you're not allowed
to make any calls.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.102
In fact, you're not allowed to receive
any calls, other than from me.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.438
And I'm gonna be calling
every half hour.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.440
You know, just to make sure

28:13.608 --> 28:16.527
everything's going well
with the studies.

28:16.695 --> 28:20.364
Thanks, Dad. I really appreciate
you trusting me so much

28:20.532 --> 28:22.449
- you're putting me under phone arrest.
- Well.

28:22.617 --> 28:25.160
You've given a whole new meaning
to the term cell phone.

28:25.328 --> 28:28.330
- Enjoy.
- And don't worry,

28:28.498 --> 28:32.042
I don't need the car. I can just walk.
It's not like the hills are crawling

28:32.210 --> 28:34.128
with low-lifes
or escaped mental patients,

28:34.295 --> 28:36.255
convicts and gangsters
with guns and knives.

28:36.423 --> 28:40.300
Please take the car,
I wouldn't have it any other way.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.470
OK, if you insist.

28:44.305 --> 28:47.766
But I need you to know
that I'm not really a monster.

28:47.934 --> 28:50.728
It's just that other than love,
the most important thing

28:50.895 --> 28:53.147
between a daughter and father is trust.

28:53.314 --> 28:56.108
Of course, Dad. And I want to trust you.

28:56.276 --> 29:00.779
Seriously, one more deception,
you're staying here. There's no UCSB.

29:00.947 --> 29:04.950
You're gonna live here
and you're gonna go to junior college.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.411
Study well.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.428
I thought you said she was grounded.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.888
(Blair) Well, that's what
Teddy heard from Buck's sister.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.014
(Lisa) So?

29:27.182 --> 29:28.891
They have a friend
who's in Cayenne's Spanish class.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.059
That's great intel, guys.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.064
(Lisa) What is she doing?

29:42.030 --> 29:44.114
Why does she have a backpack?

29:44.282 --> 29:46.200
- What's in her backpack?
- Books?

29:46.367 --> 29:49.369
No one carries books in a backpack.

29:49.537 --> 29:51.622
That little wench is up to something.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.339
(  "Drive")

30:00.507 --> 30:03.300
Loving it all, I've got it made

30:03.468 --> 30:06.512
Now I'm the one who is ashamed

30:06.679 --> 30:09.723
I had her heart
It was in my hands

30:20.026 --> 30:21.777
She didn't take her backpack.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.321
(knock on door)

30:28.535 --> 30:31.662
- You're here. It's a prison break.
- If only.

30:31.830 --> 30:35.082
You know those electronic cuffs
they put on criminals' ankles?

30:35.250 --> 30:39.753
This is worse. My dad's gonna call every
half hour to check in on me.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.589
Nail scissors.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.967
No, thanks. I'm fine.

30:45.134 --> 30:47.010
Get me nail scissors.

30:55.270 --> 30:58.230
Pay attention.
You might learn something.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.148
(car door opening)

31:02.277 --> 31:05.779
Your father is Big Brother
and he's watching you.

31:06.739 --> 31:09.116
My one shot at
high school nirvana is blown.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.617
(  "Shadows of the Night"
playing on TV)

31:10.785 --> 31:14.955
- What are you watching?
- Just reliving my glory year.

31:15.123 --> 31:19.042
Ninth grade, the talent show.
Cayenne and I rocked the house.

31:19.210 --> 31:22.671
- It's been all downhill since then.
- That is so not true.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.716
If anything, you've gotten better. I've
seen you play like a thousand times.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.759
You could so be
a big glamorous star right now.

31:27.927 --> 31:31.221
Yeah, except for the minor detail
of my vocal cords freezing,

31:31.389 --> 31:35.976
the panic attacks and the projectile
vomiting if I set foot on stage.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.270
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

31:38.438 --> 31:40.647
Alexa, do you have anything I can eat?

31:40.815 --> 31:44.026
What, the Twinkies and the Skittles
aren't gonna hold you?

31:46.571 --> 31:49.323
(Alexa singing
"Shadows of the Night" onTV)

31:54.662 --> 31:58.498
- (Danny) So this Mandy Gilbert girl...
- (boy) She's got some sweet boobsicles.

31:58.666 --> 32:00.250
No wonder Drew's trying...

32:00.418 --> 32:01.835
(Danny) Yeah, but she's
not girlfriend material.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.338
He'sjust gonna do her and drop her.
You know, hit and run.

32:04.505 --> 32:07.799
(boy) Yeah. Strictly a hump and dump.
And then rush her out.

32:08.468 --> 32:10.218
Hit and run?

32:10.386 --> 32:12.137
Hump and dump? Rush her?

32:12.305 --> 32:14.848
- (exclaiming in disgust)
- Where did you find this?

32:15.016 --> 32:17.476
Melissa Gilcrest was
under the bleachers at school.

32:17.644 --> 32:21.521
She just sent it to me, but...
OK, I kept asking myself, you know,

32:21.689 --> 32:25.692
what would a fly guy like Drew
want with our dear sweet Mandy?

32:25.860 --> 32:27.653
And then it hit me.

32:27.820 --> 32:29.404
The ritual sacrifice.

32:29.572 --> 32:33.033
What are you saying?
Drew Patterson is an Aztec?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.494
Definitely a descendant.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.996
Because every year
at the Patterson bash,

32:38.164 --> 32:41.708
a Patterson boy
takes a girl up to the tower

32:41.876 --> 32:45.462
where he deflowers them in the shower.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.216
OK. Drew is no different. He's
gonna be just like his big brothers.

32:49.384 --> 32:53.178
- That whole thing is stupid gossip.
- It's more than gossip. It's a rumor.

32:53.930 --> 32:54.888
I say we tell her.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.724
I say you keep your mouth shut
and let her dream.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.186
Guys, it's 5:28. We've only got
two minutes until my dad calls,

33:01.354 --> 33:03.188
and I promised him your mom
would be here. Where is she?

33:03.356 --> 33:06.566
AA meeting. And then she's
meeting Jennifer for a drink.

33:07.235 --> 33:11.238
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

33:12.573 --> 33:15.701
Home movies. Do you have
any home movies of your mom?

33:15.868 --> 33:18.286
I don't know.
She hates being videotaped.

33:18.454 --> 33:20.914
Come on, you have to have something.
He's gonna call any minute.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.082
(cell phone ringing)

33:22.250 --> 33:24.584
- What the hell is that?
- I got a million videotapes here.

33:24.752 --> 33:27.212
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Mandy, just checking in.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.380
What you doing?

33:30.550 --> 33:34.803
- (Alexa) '91 , no. '92, no.
- Reading 1984.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.473
Yeah, I'm right at the part where
Winston is about to go stark raving mad.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.934
You know, because he can't escape
the relentless, meddling,

33:41.102 --> 33:44.771
- intrusive gaze of Big Brother.
- Oh, my God. Our first talent show.

33:45.648 --> 33:48.275
- Hey, what's that?
- (Alexa) We'll watch it.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.110
There are boys there?

33:50.278 --> 33:52.446
- Guys. Guys.
- OK. Perfect.

33:52.613 --> 33:56.950
Dad, no. There's no boys here. And
Alexa's mom is around here somewhere.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.619
Would it be too much trouble
if I asked to see her?

34:01.080 --> 34:03.832
Uh... All right, Dad.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.544
All right. If you insist.

34:07.962 --> 34:09.755
Kind of. I do. Yeah.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.184
Get out of here! Out! Get out!

34:22.351 --> 34:23.476
- Get out!
- Jeez! Stop!

34:23.643 --> 34:25.645
Mandy, thanks.
I'll call back in a half hour.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.606
But the... Yeah.

34:28.815 --> 34:31.109
OK. Bye.

34:32.235 --> 34:35.112
- (laughs)
- Wow.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.993
That was seriously insanely stressful.
I cannot believe it worked.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.245
You guys, we can do this.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.873
We can totally punk my dad.
He's only going to call twice an hour.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.501
You think we can pull off
such a radical punk?

34:47.668 --> 34:50.420
Mandy, your rampaging hormones are
making you delusional. Be reasonable.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.505
Drew Patterson's waiting for me,

34:52.672 --> 34:55.592
ergo, tonight's not about
being reasonable.

35:09.524 --> 35:12.609
- Lisa.
- She scares me.

35:12.777 --> 35:16.363
That vial she wears around her neck,
it's got Marilyn Manson's blood in it.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.533
- Marilyn Manson doesn't have blood.
- (Cayenne) She's psycho, OK.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.120
Don't go to the dark side, Mandy.
That's just what she wants.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.834
You're right. I'm not gonna get mad.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.379
We're gonna go shopping.

35:32.547 --> 35:36.258
We have to find
a seriously wicked outfit.

35:57.905 --> 36:00.907
Should've known trashing that crappy
little rag wouldn't stop her.

36:01.075 --> 36:03.243
She's probably gonna try
and score some killer outfit.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.203
What if she finds something
outrageously cool?

36:05.371 --> 36:08.623
Highly doubtful.
But I'm not taking any chances.

36:08.791 --> 36:13.336
Remember when Four Eyes ate that
macadamia nut cookie in second grade,

36:13.504 --> 36:16.006
and puffed up like a blowfish?

36:26.058 --> 36:28.435
How am I gonna get her
to chow down on it?

36:28.603 --> 36:32.856
Tell her it's free.
Tell her it's orgasmic, whatever.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.775
Just make sure
she puts it into her pie hole.

36:46.662 --> 36:51.082
Are you kidding me? A $10 Scoopy
Yogurt card just for trying this?

36:51.250 --> 36:54.002
(exclaims) This is my lucky day.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.843
It's like a sauna in there.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.889
You know, I feel really bloated.
I mean, nothing is looking good on me.

37:10.436 --> 37:13.230
Mandy... Your face.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.482
It's alive.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.442
What's happening to you?

37:17.610 --> 37:20.153
Jeez Louise, you guys.
What is the big deal?

37:22.740 --> 37:24.908
Oh, my God. I have butt face.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.536
- (cell phone ringing)
- It's my dad.

37:30.957 --> 37:33.583
Hey, Dad. I know you probably want
to see us hard at work.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.377
So here it goes.

37:42.969 --> 37:46.054
Great, girls. Keep up the good work.
I'll call you back.

37:46.222 --> 37:47.264
Bye.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.226
It worked. I'm safe.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.272
- (Lisa laughing)
- Not for long.

37:57.692 --> 38:00.568
- Butt face!
- (all laughing)

38:00.736 --> 38:02.529
- Butt face!
- Butt face.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.033
Crap, this is a nightmare.

38:09.996 --> 38:13.123
Take some of my Lexadril.
I use it for my allergies. It works.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.332
Here.

38:20.548 --> 38:21.798
(kids screaming)

38:25.928 --> 38:28.221
(Mandy) It's amazing.
It works, like, right away.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.849
- Are you sure you're OK now?
- I'm fine.

38:32.601 --> 38:33.685
Easy.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.857
Not too much. It makes you sleepy.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.987
Don't be ridiculous, you guys.
I'm not even tired.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.615
There is no way
I'm going to fall asleep.

38:51.871 --> 38:52.829
- Mandy!
- Mandy!

38:52.997 --> 38:54.205
Mandy. Here.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.960
- Have you seen Mandy?
- She's not here.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.256
- Your lying skills haven't improved.
- We saw her at the makeup counter.

39:03.424 --> 39:05.008
Her face was huge.

39:05.176 --> 39:08.970
Well, if you happen to see her,
tell her we'll miss her tonight.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.522
- Come on.
- That slut. She can't stop me.

39:20.941 --> 39:23.234
I'm gonna beat her at her own game.

39:25.279 --> 39:27.447
- Mandy.
- Your face is better.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.494
I need to get dry.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.837
The Holy Grail.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.884
Let us take a moment of silence
for the perfect outfit.

40:03.442 --> 40:06.653
I can't believe I just spent two months'
paycheck on 20 ounces of fabric.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.196
I am flat broke.

40:08.989 --> 40:11.116
Why do I feel so fantastic?

40:11.283 --> 40:13.284
(cell phone ringing)

40:13.452 --> 40:14.577
Hey, Pop.

40:14.745 --> 40:15.870
Yeah, I bet you're wondering
what we're doing,

40:16.038 --> 40:19.457
and we're still hitting the books.
Let me show you.

40:23.003 --> 40:26.005
Wow, looks like you guys
haven't even moved.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.592
Hello? What's happening?

40:29.760 --> 40:33.763
- Well, I'm losing the signal.
- Might be on your end or mine.

40:33.931 --> 40:37.100
I'll call you back
on Alexa's landline, all right?

40:39.228 --> 40:42.522
Landline, landline. Plan B.
We've got to get reception.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.359
Now, finding that number.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.321
There we go.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.371
(phone ringing)

41:07.756 --> 41:08.965
Hello?

41:09.842 --> 41:11.217
(Alexa) Hello?

41:11.385 --> 41:12.635
Hi, Alexa?

41:15.222 --> 41:16.389
Yes.

41:16.557 --> 41:19.309
Yeah, it's Mandy's father.
Is Mandy there?

41:21.562 --> 41:22.562
Uh-huh.

41:24.273 --> 41:27.108
OK, could I speak with her, please?

41:28.819 --> 41:29.819
Uh-huh.

41:31.989 --> 41:35.283
Now. May I speak with her now?
It's her father...

41:37.244 --> 41:38.244
...calling.

41:39.079 --> 41:41.456
Please hold. I have another call.

41:47.922 --> 41:51.132
Hi. Sorry for putting you on hold,
but it was my dad.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.927
- Yeah.
- I'll get Mandy for you.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.763
Oh, darn, she's in the bathroom.

41:56.931 --> 42:00.517
- Would you like to wait?
- Would I like to wait?

42:00.684 --> 42:03.353
Sure, I'd love to wait.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.438
Come on, give me some bars.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.233
Gosh. Thank you.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.484
(dialing)

42:12.196 --> 42:13.196
(cell phone ringing)

42:17.576 --> 42:18.910
Hello?

42:19.078 --> 42:21.621
Hey! What's going on here?

42:21.789 --> 42:23.540
- Nothing.
- Mandy.

42:23.707 --> 42:26.125
Would you mind
showing me that nothing?

42:26.293 --> 42:29.045
Dad, I'm still in the bathroom.
Do you want a play by play?

42:29.213 --> 42:32.549
- I'll call you back in two minutes.
- Yeah, that's fine. Hello?

42:34.969 --> 42:36.678
Brown leather couch.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.974
- Excuse me, these leather pieces are...
- OK. Lamp, that one.

42:41.141 --> 42:43.810
- And the room divider.
- I don't have a room divider.

42:43.978 --> 42:44.936
It's not like my dad knows that.

42:45.104 --> 42:47.939
It's either the room divider or the rest
of the furniture store. Move!

42:52.152 --> 42:55.280
Fifty-two seconds
until hell phone doomsday.

42:55.447 --> 42:57.156
Thank you, always so helpful.

42:58.200 --> 43:00.994
Just sit down. Take your shoes off.
And act natural.

43:01.161 --> 43:02.662
Stuff your face!

43:11.005 --> 43:14.674
(Bruce) Are you girls part
of some sort of reality show?

43:20.639 --> 43:21.639
Um...

43:22.433 --> 43:23.600
Bruce.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.894
I promise to make a purchase, OK?

43:27.062 --> 43:31.065
All you have to do is sit here,
smile and wave.

43:31.233 --> 43:33.818
Two minutes tops. Thank you.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.863
Everybody settled?

43:37.489 --> 43:40.199
- Should I be calling my agent?
- No.

43:40.367 --> 43:45.079
No. OK, just please go with the flow.
And act fatherly and read the paper.

43:50.544 --> 43:52.211
(cell phone ringing)

43:52.379 --> 43:55.214
Yeah. Hi, Mandy. What's going on?

43:55.382 --> 43:58.676
- Who's that man?
- We're just hanging and...

43:58.844 --> 44:03.097
Dad, don't be rude.
You remember Alexa's step-dad?

44:03.265 --> 44:04.390
Gerald.

44:08.812 --> 44:10.146
He's a mortician.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.068
Right. OK. I'm...

44:15.235 --> 44:19.072
So I'll call you back in a half hour.
Hello, Gerald.

44:20.407 --> 44:22.575
OK. Bye.

44:27.414 --> 44:29.165
- Oh, my gosh.
- We rock.

44:30.959 --> 44:32.543
Thank you, Bruce!

44:33.253 --> 44:35.421
- Thanks, Bruce.
- Thanks, Brucey.

44:35.589 --> 44:38.591
Hey, whatever you girls are on,
can I have some?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.842
(laughing)

44:40.010 --> 44:42.845
(man on PA) Bruce, please
report to the manager's office.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.230
(Lisa laughing)

44:54.108 --> 44:56.818
Cinderella's carriage
turned back into a pumpkin.

44:56.985 --> 44:59.362
She is so smoked.

44:59.530 --> 45:01.948
That'll teach her to mess
with the Alpha Blonde.

45:02.783 --> 45:05.868
Blair, I want you
to spy on the schizoid.

45:06.036 --> 45:07.578
- Make sure she's down and out.
- Why me?

45:07.746 --> 45:09.372
Because pretty eyes see better.

45:12.209 --> 45:14.377
- Get out.
- OK.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.805
(Mandy) No!

45:25.973 --> 45:28.141
(man) Don't bother begging or crying.

45:28.308 --> 45:29.308
(Mandy) No, that's my car!

45:29.476 --> 45:30.643
You can pick it up
at the impound in an hour.

45:30.811 --> 45:32.228
What goes in the truck
stays in the truck.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.355
It'll be about $300.

45:46.618 --> 45:48.953
Talk about a nail in the coffin.

45:50.372 --> 45:54.584
- No. We've got to get the money.
- How?

46:07.347 --> 46:09.849
(playing rock music)

46:24.615 --> 46:27.116
Mandy, I feel dizzy.

46:27.284 --> 46:31.162
Like I'm gonna pass out and wake up
in a pool of my own making.

46:31.330 --> 46:35.166
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Look at the crowd. They love it.

46:36.043 --> 46:37.794
(singer) Thank you.
Don't forget to vote for us.

46:37.961 --> 46:40.213
Alexa. Alexa, think about it.

46:40.881 --> 46:42.882
Which one of us has the skills here?

46:43.050 --> 46:46.385
- Thank you very much.
- You're right, I...

46:46.553 --> 46:48.846
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna take one for the team.

46:49.014 --> 46:51.390
- Good.
- I got it.

46:51.558 --> 46:52.892
You're Dead Meat?

46:53.519 --> 46:55.728
- How did you guess?
- You're on.

47:01.944 --> 47:05.071
Time to take
the training wheels off, kiddo.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.004
Come on, Alexa!

47:29.638 --> 47:31.013
I can't sing.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.443
(audience booing)

47:45.612 --> 47:47.029
I don't got it.

47:47.197 --> 47:48.614
- You do it.
- Me?

47:48.782 --> 47:52.243
- (Mandy) No, you do it.
- (Alexa) I can't. Brain fading fast.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.795
Let's go!

48:16.268 --> 48:20.229
You said, oh, girl
It's a cold world

48:20.397 --> 48:23.816
When you keep it all to yourself

48:24.234 --> 48:28.237
I said, you can't hide on the inside

48:28.405 --> 48:32.158
All the pain you've ever felt

48:33.493 --> 48:36.746
Ransom my heart, baby
Don't look back

48:36.914 --> 48:41.167
'Cause we got nobody else

48:42.127 --> 48:46.297
We're running with
the shadows of the night

48:46.465 --> 48:50.551
So, baby, take my hand
It'll be all right

48:50.719 --> 48:54.472
Surrender all your dreams
to me tonight

48:54.640 --> 48:58.184
They'll come true in the end

48:58.352 --> 48:59.435
Stop!

49:04.191 --> 49:05.191
My dad.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.445
If everybody could please be quiet?

49:11.073 --> 49:12.740
I'm asking nicely.

49:15.827 --> 49:17.244
Yo, I said quiet!

49:19.539 --> 49:20.748
Thanks.

49:21.583 --> 49:25.461
I'm 18 years old
and I've never been in love.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.089
Never even been kissed,

49:28.256 --> 49:31.258
but right now, I have the chance
to be with this really,

49:31.426 --> 49:33.219
really amazing guy.

49:34.012 --> 49:37.390
But my dad's car got towed,
and I need 300 bucks.

49:37.557 --> 49:39.725
And he's gonna call me on
my video phone any second.

49:39.893 --> 49:44.522
And if I can't convince him that
I'm anywhere but here, I'm screwed.

49:44.690 --> 49:46.649
My life is over.

49:46.817 --> 49:48.234
Do you understand?

49:49.319 --> 49:52.405
So I'm begging you.

49:53.490 --> 49:55.574
I'm asking you to just please...

49:56.451 --> 49:58.035
Please help me.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.789
- (cell phone ringing)
- That's my dad.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.837
Please, just... Please, help me.

50:13.969 --> 50:17.054
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Mandy.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.098
Listen.

50:19.266 --> 50:23.936
About the duplex.
You know, it really is just one option.

50:25.313 --> 50:28.733
- And it's a darn fine one, Dad.
- Yeah.

50:30.193 --> 50:32.820
- So, what are you girls doing?
- Uh...

50:32.988 --> 50:34.989
We're taking a break and...

50:35.949 --> 50:37.950
...we're watching a DVD.

50:38.118 --> 50:41.078
- Oh, yeah, which one?
- Um...

50:41.788 --> 50:44.749
Dance Like You Mean It 2.

50:45.459 --> 50:46.876
- What?
- (audience) What?

50:47.044 --> 50:48.919
Cool.

50:49.087 --> 50:54.008
Hey, do me a favor.
Point your video camera at the DVD.

50:54.176 --> 50:58.137
I want to see how good this looks
on the phone. All right?

51:01.933 --> 51:03.100
(inaudible)

51:05.645 --> 51:07.354
(playing "Shadows of the Night")

51:37.886 --> 51:40.096
(Tom) That's weird, the...

51:40.889 --> 51:46.268
The clock in the DVD says 7:32,
and it's 7:32.

51:47.020 --> 51:50.106
Wow. Go figure.

51:50.774 --> 51:54.360
Yeah. Do me a favor and let the DVD

51:54.528 --> 51:56.862
play a little longer and then pause it.

51:59.491 --> 52:04.328
All right.
I'm taping and now I'm pausing.

52:08.291 --> 52:09.291
Huh.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.760
That's...

52:21.555 --> 52:22.847
That's a fine DVD.

52:25.559 --> 52:28.727
- OK.
- OK.

52:28.895 --> 52:30.354
I'll talk to you in a half hour.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.106
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

52:33.900 --> 52:35.234
(all laughing)

52:35.944 --> 52:37.653
(all applauding)

52:37.821 --> 52:40.239
Thank you so, so much.

52:41.158 --> 52:44.577
You know that sometimes it feels like

52:44.744 --> 52:48.539
It's all moving way too fast

52:48.707 --> 52:53.460
Use every alibi and words you deny

52:53.628 --> 52:56.755
That love ain't meant to last

52:57.591 --> 53:01.427
You can cry tough, baby
It's all right

53:01.595 --> 53:06.807
You can let me down easy
But not tonight

53:06.975 --> 53:11.061
We're running with
the shadows of the night

53:11.229 --> 53:15.274
So, baby, take my hand
It'll be all right

53:15.442 --> 53:19.069
Surrender all your dreams
to me tonight

53:19.237 --> 53:22.823
They'll come true in the end

53:23.366 --> 53:25.201
(all cheering)

53:25.911 --> 53:29.163
Yeah, I know.
I'm watching it and I don't believe it.

53:32.918 --> 53:33.959
(doorbell ringing)

53:35.337 --> 53:38.839
Hey, hey. There he is.
How you doing, buddy?

53:39.007 --> 53:40.633
Give me some of that, or not.

53:42.135 --> 53:45.221
He's fantastic.
Well, he just knows to run away.

53:46.139 --> 53:48.098
What are you gonna do all day?

53:48.266 --> 53:51.268
Shopping, then yoga,
then more shopping.

53:51.436 --> 53:53.312
You know, the more I spend,
the harder Ray has to work

53:53.480 --> 53:54.605
and the less I have to see him.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.149
I figure about two more maxed-out Visas
and... He's gone.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.984
- That's a nice plan.
- Thank you very much.

53:59.152 --> 54:00.861
We're gonna be here bonding.
You don't worry about a thing.

54:01.029 --> 54:02.154
- Go. I got it.
- Good. Thank you

54:02.322 --> 54:03.364
- I need the break.
- You're welcome. All right.

54:03.531 --> 54:05.866
- You're a good uncle.
- No problem.

54:06.034 --> 54:07.076
- See you.
- Bye.

54:07.244 --> 54:11.205
- (door closing)
- Just gonna be us now.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.630
- Where is she?
- She hasn't come out yet.

54:19.798 --> 54:24.009
(man) Congratulations to our
Battle of the Bands winner, Dead Meat.

54:25.345 --> 54:28.681
Oh, my God. She's a zombie.
She keeps rising up from the dead.

54:28.848 --> 54:30.849
(Kimberly) Where did
she get that outfit?

54:31.017 --> 54:33.185
- Are you seeing this?
- (Lisa) Do I look blind?

54:33.353 --> 54:36.689
That poser almost looks hot.
Damn her.

54:40.193 --> 54:42.736
Lenny? This is Lisa Cross.

54:43.280 --> 54:46.115
There's a wacko stalking Drew.
She just escaped from the nut house.

54:46.283 --> 54:49.952
She's driving this
ugly old American car.

54:50.120 --> 54:53.163
- License...
- 1TAH-498.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.042
- I'm really good with numbers.
- I thought you failed math?

54:57.210 --> 55:02.089
- I lied.
- Her license is 1TAH-498.

55:02.257 --> 55:05.968
She's with two other punk-ass girls.
Don't let her in.

55:06.136 --> 55:09.054
- I am so in awe of you.
- Save it.

55:09.222 --> 55:12.683
Let's get our butts to the mall.
That outfit is mine.

55:19.232 --> 55:20.733
Hey.

55:20.900 --> 55:23.527
What do you got there?
You wanna put that back?

55:23.695 --> 55:26.697
- Yeah? No?
- No.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.032
Don't you...

55:29.868 --> 55:31.869
Don't take one more step.

55:34.539 --> 55:39.043
Listen to me.
You are not going to break that.

55:39.210 --> 55:42.129
You're going to put it down
or you're going to give it to me.

55:42.297 --> 55:44.423
- No.
- But you are not...

55:45.383 --> 55:47.051
Peyton.

55:47.218 --> 55:50.429
One of us is gonna blink
and it's not gonna be me.

56:04.069 --> 56:06.070
- Peyton, get back here.
- (glass breaking)

56:06.237 --> 56:08.280
(Tom groaning)

56:08.448 --> 56:10.282
Ow, ow!

56:13.661 --> 56:16.872
Hold it right there, please, ladies.
Hold it right there, please.

56:23.338 --> 56:27.049
Nice try, but I saw your license plate
and I've been tipped off.

56:27.217 --> 56:31.553
- What do you mean, tipped off?
- It was so Lisa and her cult.

56:31.721 --> 56:33.305
You're the wacko stalking
Drew Patterson.

56:33.473 --> 56:35.933
No, no, no, you have me confused
with some other wacko.

56:36.101 --> 56:40.312
- He invited me, I'm on the list.
- You're on the list all right.

56:40.980 --> 56:43.524
Look. I'm gonna call the cops,
all right?

56:43.691 --> 56:46.902
So why don't you
just back away and back off.

56:47.904 --> 56:52.241
Mandy. Maybe itjust wasn't
meant to be. You know?

56:52.409 --> 56:55.160
The only list we're on
is the loser list.

56:55.328 --> 56:57.830
My whole life
I've been on the loser list.

57:08.842 --> 57:10.300
Lisa, it's Lenny.

57:13.513 --> 57:14.888
Thanks, Lenny.

57:16.182 --> 57:19.810
She just won't give up.
She's like a pit bull with boobs.

57:19.978 --> 57:22.521
Time to get a little more proactive.

57:26.234 --> 57:27.943
Peyton.

57:28.111 --> 57:29.945
Game over, buddy.

57:30.113 --> 57:31.905
(cell phone ringing)

57:36.369 --> 57:39.663
- Yeah, hello.
- Hi. May I please talk to Mandy?

57:39.831 --> 57:42.624
Yeah, well, no. She's not here.
She's at Alexa's house.

57:42.792 --> 57:46.545
Really? She was supposed to be here
with the booze an hour ago.

57:46.713 --> 57:50.632
- Booze? What booze?
- Oh, well. Have a nice night.

57:50.800 --> 57:52.301
No, no, no. Don't hang up.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.719
Hello?

58:07.400 --> 58:08.525
(cell phone ringing)

58:09.360 --> 58:11.403
Big Father again.

58:11.571 --> 58:14.740
- It can't be. I still got six minutes.
- Pull over.

58:14.908 --> 58:16.408
(honking)

58:17.744 --> 58:20.787
I can't. Give me my sweatshirt.

58:34.260 --> 58:36.094
Hey, Dad. What's up?

58:36.262 --> 58:38.514
Just having fun. How about you?

58:38.681 --> 58:40.724
Hey, got any booze?

58:41.559 --> 58:43.310
Why? Are you running low?

58:43.478 --> 58:45.938
Come on, Dad,
you know I wouldn't do that.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.025
Hey, what's that?
You're not driving in a car, are you?

58:51.861 --> 58:56.323
No, I'm looking for a CD.

58:56.491 --> 58:57.783
Here, look.

59:03.331 --> 59:05.082
No hands. No eyes.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.378
Let me see the keys.

59:10.129 --> 59:12.464
Uh... Sure, the keys. Right.

59:18.763 --> 59:20.973
See? Dad, now, think about it.

59:21.140 --> 59:22.849
I couldn't very well be
zooming down the street

59:23.017 --> 59:25.310
with no hands on the wheels,
covering my eyes

59:25.478 --> 59:29.022
and dangling the keys, now, could I?
Jeez. A little trust would be nice.

59:30.275 --> 59:33.610
(Tom) Yeah, I don't know
what's the matter with me.

59:33.778 --> 59:36.071
- You know, with you graduating...
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

59:36.239 --> 59:39.032
I really want to nail my econ final,
so I have to go hit the books. Bye.

59:39.200 --> 59:40.450
- Hey, Mandy.
- Yes, Dad.

59:40.618 --> 59:42.119
- Love you.
- Love you, too, bye.

59:43.621 --> 59:45.622
- Put the keys back in.
- I'm... Hey, I'm...

59:46.040 --> 59:48.000
(groaning)

59:48.167 --> 59:50.377
Guys, come on. Guys, seriously.

59:51.963 --> 59:54.381
(Cayenne screaming) Start, come on!

59:55.800 --> 59:57.009
(all screaming)

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.195
Hey. There you are, good one.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:21.617
Look at you,
you're gonna be an architect. Nice.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:26.538
What are you... What are you...
Well, don't do that.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:30.292
All right.

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:33.378
That's not fair.
No, no, no, no, no.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:36.340
OK. Look at me now. Look at me now.

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:37.799
Hey.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:40.344
Hey, no, no. Oh, no, no.

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:42.012
Seriously, I'll go onto the roof.

01:00:49.854 --> 01:00:52.356
This is getting weird.

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:56.943
Getting weird? We crossed the line
from desperation to deranged hours ago.

01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:59.071
OK? We almost died.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:02.574
A rational person
would take that as a sign.

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:08.955
A sign.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:13.460
This. This is a sign.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:16.672
A sign I shouldn't give up.

01:01:20.343 --> 01:01:22.594
Yeah, you know it's not a toy.

01:01:23.429 --> 01:01:27.391
I'm not upset that you broke it.
But I worked on it for a very long time,

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:29.893
and you destroyed it
in a matter of seconds.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:32.521
Yeah, that's not upsetting at all.

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:35.315
Why don't we just sit here,
take a little time-out.

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:39.403
Let's see ifwe can't entertain you
for a couple of minutes.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:40.570
- (Peyton chuckles)
- Keep your hands off...

01:01:40.738 --> 01:01:43.365
Sesame Street
is always good, as is Barney.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:48.245
What do we have here?

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.581
This might be interesting.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:55.627
All I need is for you to sit there...

01:01:56.671 --> 01:02:01.883
...and not break things.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.470
You're still behind me, right?

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:07.639
(woman on TV) Doing great.

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:09.599
Good, good. One more push.

01:02:09.767 --> 01:02:11.476
(grunting)

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:15.647
(doctor) Yes, good, good, good.

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.402
One more, one...

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.280
That's good.

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.407
It's a girl.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:30.912
Cut the cord, Mr. Gilbert.

01:02:31.497 --> 01:02:32.914
Mr. Gilbert?

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.166
Mr. Gilbert.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.667
(Tom) You're rolling. Got it, sis?

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.753
- (Marsha) Yeah, I got it, go.
- OK, eyes closed.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.339
I'll walk you over the step. Your big
birthday... Step. There you go.

01:02:41.507 --> 01:02:44.676
Birthday surprise coming up.
Keep those eyes closed.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:47.095
And open your eyes.

01:02:47.263 --> 01:02:48.889
- Happy birthday, kitten!
- (Marsha) Happy birthday, Mandy!

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:50.557
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.684
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.061
- It's the best bike ever!
- I know.

01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:58.899
- Can I try it? Let's try it.
- Yes, yes, it's yours. Happy birthday!

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:01.359
- Got it?
- (Marsha) Yeah, I got, I got it.

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:04.863
- OK, Daddy, let go.
- I know, you got it.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.114
Daddy, you can let go now.

01:03:06.282 --> 01:03:07.365
- You got...
- Daddy, I got it!

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:09.117
OK, OK, there you go.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:10.327
You got it. You're on your own.
You got it!

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:11.536
(Marsha whooping)

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:14.956
You're doing it.
You don't need me, that's great.

01:03:15.124 --> 01:03:16.541
Look at her.

01:03:41.901 --> 01:03:43.568
(Lenny exclaiming)

01:03:43.736 --> 01:03:45.320
(Spanish song playing on radio)

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:53.411
(speaking French)

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:59.084
(speaking Spanish)

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:02.587
Germans.

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:04.965
Go right ahead, ladies.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:12.597
- I can't believe it. We made it in.
- Of course.

01:04:12.765 --> 01:04:13.890
(whooping)

01:04:33.744 --> 01:04:35.287
(Peyton laughing)

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.625
(music playing on TV)

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.884
(man on TV) Are you ready
for Babes Gone Bonkerz?

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.969
(woman) Bring it on, baby.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.931
You want to meet the twins?

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.392
Do you want to meet the twins?

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.688
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

01:05:01.856 --> 01:05:03.815
- Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
- Let's...

01:05:03.983 --> 01:05:06.192
Let's not tell your mom about this.
OK? What do you say?

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.486
Let's play a new game.
We're gonna play hide and seek.

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.614
Yeah, sound good? What do you say?

01:05:10.781 --> 01:05:13.491
You hide, and I'm gonna count
to a really big number,

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:17.537
and then I'll come find you.
Ready? Go hide.

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:24.753
(  "Tell Me You Love Me")

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:29.007
Tell me all your dreams
that you wanna come true

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:32.344
I listen to you sing while I pretend

01:05:32.511 --> 01:05:35.180
You tell me all your lies
but you can't

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:37.849
Tell me you love me

01:05:38.517 --> 01:05:40.977
Just tell me you love me

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:46.149
I remember one day
when we laughed out loud

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:49.986
When I saw your face
in a faceless crowd

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:53.156
You hit me like lightning

01:05:53.324 --> 01:05:56.159
And your words are frightening

01:05:58.079 --> 01:06:00.622
(Alexa) Queen of Darkness
jacked your outfit.

01:06:01.582 --> 01:06:04.209
That's it. It's over.

01:06:07.004 --> 01:06:10.298
Listen. It's for the best.

01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:14.886
We saw a video and...

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.889
...Danny Sherpil
called you a hump and dump

01:06:18.057 --> 01:06:20.225
and said Drew was gonna hit and run.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.186
- What?
- The Patterson Legend?

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:27.107
The virginal sacrifice?
Every year at this party,

01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:30.527
a Patterson male has a girl
meet him in the tower.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.029
And he gets her into the shower.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:35.615
Maybe he wasn't even
gonna start the shower.

01:06:35.783 --> 01:06:37.909
Well, if he does, you know he's got
a whole lot more planned

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:39.536
than a shampoo and cream rinse.

01:06:39.704 --> 01:06:44.124
Mandy, if you were to walk up
those stairs, everyone would know,

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:48.586
and unless he fell head over heels
in love with you and dumped Lisa,

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:52.757
you'd forever be a tower girl,
and be even more shunned than usual.

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.886
Trust me, Lisa did you a favor
by jacking your baby.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:01.307
Yeah. Yeah, you guys are right.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:04.561
Itjust wasn't meant to be.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:08.690
- You're wrong.
- OK, I'm confused.

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.818
I know. I know what Danny Sherpil said.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:13.945
And I know what I've
been saying all night,

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:17.782
but, Mandy, the Force is with you.

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:21.786
Look at the facts, you've survived
a butt face, a near drowning,

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:25.790
you entirely rearranged the furniture
department at Morrison's.

01:07:25.958 --> 01:07:28.543
OK, you conquered
a bar full of drunks.

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:31.379
You survived a death car on the freeway.

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.299
And against all odds,
you have done the impossible

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.468
and totally phone-punked your dad.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:39.846
- Yeah.
- So on the contrary, Mandy...

01:07:41.557 --> 01:07:43.683
...this whole night was meant to be.

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:47.729
- You really think so?
- Yes. I do.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:54.027
- Holy crap, Cayenne.
- You are full of surprises.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.320
Thank you.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.031
(cloth tearing)

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:03.745
Peyton. Ready or not, here I come.

01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:06.289
I'm gonna find you, buddy.

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.502
Where are you? Here I come.

01:08:11.337 --> 01:08:12.796
I'm gonna find you.

01:08:12.963 --> 01:08:15.507
You're not in here, are you? No.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.468
Wasting time in that room.
Maybe in here.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:20.761
Am I getting warmer, buddy?

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:24.849
- You in here somewhere?
- (cell phone ringing)

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:28.853
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

01:08:29.395 --> 01:08:32.148
- Marsha.
- Guess what I just got?

01:08:32.316 --> 01:08:35.193
A brand new video phone,
like yours and Mandy's.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:38.529
- Really?
- Yep. How're you guys getting along?

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:40.698
Oh, terrific.

01:08:40.866 --> 01:08:42.158
He's...

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:46.078
- ...sleeping.
- You hesitated.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.207
That means you're lying,
I can always tell when you're lying.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.334
What's he wearing?

01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:56.214
The Spidey-Hulk-Bat thingy.

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:58.424
You are so busted,
that's not what he's wearing.

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:00.969
Which means
you're not in the same room with him.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.389
- Show him to me.
- What do you mean?

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.640
You heard me.
Shoot a video like you do with Mandy.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:11.729
Right. OK, well, it's just I'm hopping
to the bathroom, literally, right now.

01:09:11.897 --> 01:09:15.316
So let me call you back in two minutes
with that. OK? All right.

01:09:18.737 --> 01:09:21.029
Peyton, buddy, where are you?
Come on, work with me.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.323
I gotta find you now, buddy.
She's gonna call back.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:25.618
She's gonna call back any second.
Come on, seriously.

01:09:25.786 --> 01:09:27.537
A little help, pal. Peyton.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:31.124
Man, this is not right.
This is not happening to me.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:33.960
What am I doing? Peyton, Peyton.

01:09:34.336 --> 01:09:36.004
(  "Shiver")

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.759
I can tell exactly
how your thing's gonna end

01:09:41.926 --> 01:09:45.138
I see you chilling
but you're still unaware

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:49.058
But, boy, I'm coming for you
So you better stay aware

01:09:49.225 --> 01:09:52.937
There's no escape
if you even try to run

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:56.733
Forget, forget
It's already begun

01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:01.905
I wanna taste your love

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:06.242
Oh, I'm gonna turn you on

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:09.746
Make sure there's no time

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:13.124
Oh, I'm gonna make you shiver

01:10:17.004 --> 01:10:19.464
You made it. Any trouble getting here?

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.633
No, piece of cake.

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:27.805
Here we go, we'll improvise.
Ready, yeah.

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:33.269
Yeah, you wanna play it that way?
That's what we'll do, then. How's that?

01:10:33.437 --> 01:10:35.647
- (cell phone ringing)
- Yes, hello.

01:10:35.814 --> 01:10:37.315
All right, let's see him.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.651
Well, you know,
he's asleep as I said and...

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:43.404
And quite frankly, you know,
it doesn't seem like you trust me.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:47.158
I'm actually offended by that,
that you would not trust me.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.203
And like I said, he's asleep.

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:54.249
I'm on the fast track of getting
really cranky here, big brother.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:58.544
All right, OK, fine.
I'm going in the bedroom there.

01:10:58.712 --> 01:11:01.256
Look at him in bed,
he looks so adorable.

01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:04.384
He's...

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.636
He's so still.

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:09.597
Normally he tosses and turns
like crazy when he sleeps.

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:11.432
Oh, he does?

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:14.644
Well, maybe he's just
sleeping really soundly.

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:19.357
- See, I told you.
- Oh, yeah. Gosh, you're right.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.026
Maybe he's having a bad dream.
Maybe you should wake him up.

01:11:22.194 --> 01:11:25.405
Oh, sis, gosh, I don't know, I mean...

01:11:25.572 --> 01:11:28.866
Honestly, it took so long
to get him to go to sleep,

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:32.870
I would hate to be the cause
of him waking up.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:35.581
OK, let him sleep.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:39.836
Yeah. Let's let him sleep.
I'll talk to you later.

(sighing)

01:11:49.763 --> 01:11:53.391
I lost the kid. Why can't
I just tell her I lost the kid?

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:57.729
I lost control of my daughter.

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:01.357
I've lost control of my life.

Peyton, I don't want to be a crummy
uncle, I want to be a great uncle.

01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.744
I could be a great uncle,
if I could just find you.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:19.417
Gosh, I wonder where Peyton is.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:25.590
- You found me.
- I sure did. (laughing)

There you are.

You like that?

01:12:35.267 --> 01:12:36.726
Pretty tasty.

I know I'm home
when I'm next to you

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:13.179
(Drew) I can't believe I've been
out of your orbit for four years.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:17.850
(Mandy) Yeah, well, I haven't exactly
been what you call a rising star.

01:13:18.769 --> 01:13:22.980
You are tonight.
You're the most beautiful girl here.

01:13:23.148 --> 01:13:25.983
Drew, I don't have to be
the most beautiful.

01:13:26.151 --> 01:13:29.487
I'd just like to be somebody to you.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.740
You are.

OK, I'll meet you up there.

Your dad's gonna call,
like, in a minute.

No.

No, it's time to take a stand.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:20.872
I'm gonna tell him that I'm gonna do
what I want, when I want.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.666

if he can't trust me?

Yes, I'm fine.

Yeah, I'm just whispering because
I finally got Peyton to go to sleep.

Hey, Mandy, listen.

01:15:03.415 --> 01:15:06.667
When I raised you,
I did an OKjob, right?

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:10.588
I mean, on a scale of one to ten,

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:12.840
I was probably an eight.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.718
I mean, I was at least an eight, right?

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:18.095
I mean, it wouldn't be a five.

What is she doing?

to put a curse on Mandy.

at some point tonight,
