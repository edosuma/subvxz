WEBVTT

00:00.868 --> 00:02.601
Okay, see you.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.738
Excuse me? Can I please
use your washroom?

00:05.740 --> 00:07.506
Of course. Just in the back.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.276
Thank you.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.543
Oh, you want me hold baby
while you go?

00:11.545 --> 00:13.145
Oh. No, it's not for me,
it's for ocean.

00:13.681 --> 00:17.282
- You're going to ocean?
- No, well, yes, sometimes.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.585
"Ocean" is my baby's name.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.120
Oh. Very interesting name.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.521
It's a boy or girl?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.289
Oh, I'd rather not say.
We don't want

00:24.291 --> 00:26.392
To put any gender expectations
on her,

00:27.595 --> 00:28.611
Or him.

00:28.612 --> 00:29.628
- So, in the back?
- Yeah.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.264
Oh, wait!
You forget the diaper.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.567
But no problem, we sell.
Good price, too.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.269
No,
we don't use diapers.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.204
Uh-huh?

00:39.206 --> 00:40.339
We're practicing

00:40.341 --> 00:41.781
The elimination communication
method.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.710
I think he/she need a diaper.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.813
It's a totally natural
environmentally aware...

00:49.183 --> 00:50.416
yeah.

00:51.085 --> 00:54.453
No problem.
We also sell paper towel.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.922
Gender neutral.
Good price, too.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.777
Is it supposed to be funny

01:18.779 --> 01:20.546
When he puts the mask on,
or takes it off?

01:20.815 --> 01:23.482
That's the thing.
It plays on so many levels.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.752
- Hey, Raj.
- Hey.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.620
Hey, you guys
wanna order some food?

01:28.622 --> 01:29.455
We have popcorn.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.897
Janet has popcorn,
she's not sharing.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.257
I can.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.360
Did you...

01:35.362 --> 01:36.528
Good thing
- this isn't your job.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.763
How would this be a job?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.233
It's my parents.
Everyone shut up.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.401
Why would we have to shut up?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.435
Shh!

01:44.772 --> 01:46.505
- Hello.
- Janet.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.787
<i>- Hey, appa.</i>
- What you're doing?

01:47.842 --> 01:49.775
Nothing,
just hanging out by myself.

01:49.777 --> 01:50.777
Say hi for me.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.812
<i>- Who's that?</i>
- Gerald. He just came in.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.380
<i>Hey, man,
you like Vietnamese?</i>

01:55.382 --> 01:56.482
Yes.

01:56.484 --> 01:59.885
I'm man. Gerald calls me "man"
sometimes 'cause we're bros.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.887
<i>I don't care.</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:03.388
Need you to work tomorrow.
Okay, see you.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.724
Oh, wait. No, appa I can't...

02:06.760 --> 02:08.393
I feel like
I missed something.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.635
My parents
don't know about Raj.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.431
I meant in the movie,
but I got you.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.713
Her parents are
a little intense.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.568
And we're pretty caj. Casual.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.904
Keeping it on the DL.
Down low.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.839
It's super clear now.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.641
So, are we still
in a sensitive area,

02:22.643 --> 02:23.876
Or can we talk about dinner?

02:23.878 --> 02:26.378
- What do you feel like?
- What about Indian?

02:26.380 --> 02:28.247
Or would you prefer Korean?

02:29.283 --> 02:30.349
What?

02:33.621 --> 02:34.820
As if.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.355
I thought you were studying.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.823
I am, people keep messaging.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.458
Well, guess we have
to shut that down.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.426
Really?

02:41.428 --> 02:43.996
You can have it back
when you're done.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.933
Someone's
having a good time.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.335
You want me to
talk to them for you?

02:50.337 --> 02:51.970
No, it's cool.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.239
Hey, remember that party
at cowboy's,

02:54.241 --> 02:55.241
Where you took a bath?

02:55.609 --> 02:57.442
Yeah, my shirt was on fire.

02:57.444 --> 02:58.710
Yeah, but why take a bath?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.145
Because you were
in the fridge.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.648
I was in the fridge.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.950
- Man, that was a wild night.
- Yeah.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.385
You know, I don't think
we've had a party

03:06.387 --> 03:07.486
Since I moved in here.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.687
Really?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.289
Come to think of it,
when was the last time

03:10.291 --> 03:11.490
We even went to a party?

03:12.459 --> 03:13.525
Dude.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.295
- We're having a party.
- A rager.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.629
The kind where you wake up
the next morning

03:17.631 --> 03:18.697
And it's still happening.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.299
Friends, girls, strangers...

03:20.301 --> 03:22.301
That weird guy who only wants
to be in charge of music.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.735
Yeah,
just like in high school.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.871
Well, technically, you're
still studying high school.

03:25.873 --> 03:26.972
So, it is a high school party.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.006
Well, let's not call it that.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.775
- But party!
- Yeah! A party!

03:30.911 --> 03:32.411
Whoo!

03:32.913 --> 03:34.746
Or we could just crash
the one down the hall.

03:34.748 --> 03:35.981
Not on a school night.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.654
There's too many "eights"
in that row.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.024
Book make mistake. See?

03:46.026 --> 03:47.259
Hmm.

03:48.195 --> 03:51.263
Answer is a mistake, too.
I get different book.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.932
Ah, Mr. Kim.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.034
You remember my son, Raj?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.469
Hi, Mr. Kim,
it's been a while.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.306
Hello, Raj, you daddy
talk about you all the time.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.407
Please, Mr. Kim.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.544
The Mehta men wear flattery
like an ill-fitting cap.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.945
Humility is
our greatest attribute.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.480
I can tell.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.349
- You remember Janet?
- Hey.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.883
Hey.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.285
Janet practically
runs the store, now.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.287
Not really.

04:15.089 --> 04:15.988
Tell Mr. Kim
how you will soon graduate

04:15.990 --> 04:17.389
Top of your medical class.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.757
You just do.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.792
He's on the precipice
of great things.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.628
Janet in university, too.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.895
- Kind of.
- Thanks, appa.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.798
- Art school.
- I think it's great.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.401
Ah, there she is,

04:29.403 --> 04:31.903
The matriarch
of the Kim dynasty.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.905
Hello.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.409
Nice to see you, too.

04:37.411 --> 04:38.610
Sink is clog again.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.880
I tell you stop
dumping coffee ground.

04:41.882 --> 04:45.784
Well, we're off. Raj is taking
me to a full-priced movie.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.919
He won't even let me
sneak in our snacks.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.521
We will be purchasing them.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.124
Again, full price.
The mind boggles!

04:52.126 --> 04:53.492
Okay, see you.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.960
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:56.463 --> 04:59.831
Why he always doing
like kiss-kiss kiss-kiss?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.366
Maybe it's an Indian thing.

05:01.368 --> 05:03.802
It's creepy thing. Mehta men.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.072
- I go fix sink, now.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.041
Maybe we get the
coffee powder machine, hmm?

05:09.043 --> 05:12.778
No, they too smart.
Make me nervous.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.813
Janet.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.129
Surprise!

05:31.131 --> 05:32.764
Why didn't you tell me
you're coming?

05:37.938 --> 05:39.004
Hmm.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.575
Call me.
Bye.

05:45.346 --> 05:46.745
Mehta men.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.152
What do you mean, "maybe"?
You gotta come.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.888
It's gonna be crazy, like,

05:56.890 --> 05:59.157
Punch the wall,
hide your CDs crazy.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.659
You guys still have CDs?

06:01.061 --> 06:03.962
I got a 2pac Cd
signed by Shania twain.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.204
Feel like
there's a story there.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.399
- You just heard it.
- You should come.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.068
Sure, sounds like fun.

06:10.437 --> 06:13.905
Oh, I'm definitely going,
if I can find a babysitter,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.074
'cause I'm supposed
to babysit.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.810
- Are you good with kids?
- Not usually.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.684
Hey, I heard about the party.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.952
I'm really
looking forward to it.

06:26.954 --> 06:28.620
Yeah, I was just about
to fire you off a note.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.021
Kimchee didn't mention
if it was dinner

06:30.023 --> 06:31.790
Or just drinks,
or maybe tapas...

06:31.792 --> 06:33.125
Oh, definitely not dinner,

06:33.127 --> 06:34.993
But there'll be some bowl food
and bags of stuff.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.027
We'll bring an appetizer.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.350
Oh, no, it's really
not that kind of...

06:38.799 --> 06:39.765
Oh, I insist,
I know what hosting's like.

06:39.767 --> 06:40.932
I helped Alejandro

06:40.934 --> 06:42.901
Throw a work wine and cheese
last week.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.069
I put little flags
in the cheese,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.170
So people knew
where it came from.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.772
But then people
took the flags out

06:46.774 --> 06:48.573
To cut the cheese.
Ugh, it was chaos.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.542
Nobody knew what they were
eating. I mean, yes, cheese.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.478
But was it manchego,
or cave-aged Gruyere?

06:53.480 --> 06:55.881
Anyway,
I'll bring cheese and flags.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.948
Well, you don't have to.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.049
Like I said,
it was pretty casual.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.184
Oh, I love it.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.752
I'm so excited
to see your place.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.488
I've always wondered what
your apartment looks like.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.157
I mean, I wonder what
all of my employees' places

07:05.159 --> 07:06.658
Looks like
- and not just yours.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.926
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.461
But we will be there Friday

07:09.630 --> 07:11.563
To see your place.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.605
- So, how is store?
- Fine.

07:20.607 --> 07:21.973
Hmm. No trouble?

07:22.676 --> 07:24.776
Someone paid with
a sock full of change,

07:24.778 --> 07:26.011
But I'll let you count it.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.580
- Interesting.
- Not really.

07:28.849 --> 07:32.884
No special visitor?
No kissing bandit?

07:33.520 --> 07:35.187
- Were you spying on me?
- No.

07:35.189 --> 07:37.589
I see you when I stocking
drink that you forget.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.524
- You were spying.
- Not spying,

07:39.526 --> 07:41.560
Just walking and looking.

07:41.562 --> 07:45.764
Don't tell Umma, she'll freak.
Besides, it's not serious.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.066
Look serious.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.236
Well, I guess it could be
serious one day,

07:51.238 --> 07:52.871
Maybe, I don't know.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.840
- What?
- -I not say anything.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.274
Can't two people just...

07:56.276 --> 07:58.009
I mean, why does everything
have to be

07:58.011 --> 07:59.544
Like a whole, you know...

08:00.547 --> 08:01.713
Yeah.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.883
Don't tell Umma, please.
She's gonna ruin everything.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.920
Don't worry. I'm like a safe.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.822
No secret escaping this.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.025
You know,
your Umma afraid of giraffe?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.594
No.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.062
Because it's a secret
in appa safe.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.964
It was a secret.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.532
Free sample for new customer.

08:20.534 --> 08:23.001
Safe closing, now.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.108
Whoa!

08:30.110 --> 08:32.878
If you need money, just ask.
Don't pawn my stuff.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.279
I'm just taking
this stuff down for the party

08:34.281 --> 08:35.514
To protect it.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.628
Shouldn't we keep the good
stuff out where we can see it?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.185
I guess, it's just,
we're not 18, you know?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.853
Shouldn't we have
like nicer stuff?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.321
We have nice stuff.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.857
Most of which is mine,
and it's in my apartment.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.626
Well, I have been here
almost three years,

08:47.628 --> 08:48.927
So you could argue
it's our apartment.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.095
You'd lose that argument.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.563
Yeah,
but practically speaking...

08:51.565 --> 08:53.698
- Is your name on the lease?
- I'm not sure.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.567
- Your name on the bills?
- It's included in the rent.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.602
It's included in your rent.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.804
All I'm saying is, maybe we
should get some frame prints.

08:59.806 --> 09:02.674
- Some curtains, towels.
- We have towels!

09:02.676 --> 09:04.242
You have a towel,
I have a bath mat.

09:04.611 --> 09:07.646
Huh. Third towel. I like it.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.247
Swap out the Doritos
with some appetizers.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.849
Get some wine and craft beer.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.652
I found a great soul coffee
playlist on Spotify.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.986
I see what you're doing.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.254
You're trying to make
our party all lame

09:16.256 --> 09:17.689
Because Shalejandro is coming.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.724
What? No. Are they even?

09:20.527 --> 09:21.826
It's gonna be a great time.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.562
And I figured if
we're gonna throw a party,

09:23.564 --> 09:24.696
We might as well go all out.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.131
Hmm. Pimp the place up.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.934
Yeah, I wouldn't say "pimp,"
but yeah.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.902
Maybe even get
a door for my bedroom.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.137
Ooh, pimp Jung a door!

09:32.139 --> 09:33.219
Well, like a high end pimp.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.273
Classy escort door. Got it.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.577
Mmm.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.980
- Oh, that's a nice...
- Yeah.

09:41.982 --> 09:45.050
Mrs. Mehta show to me.
She is so crafty.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.285
They is nice family.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.055
How she ended up
with Mr. Mehta?

09:50.057 --> 09:53.024
Ah, he not so bad.
Good businessman.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.793
And smart, too.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.095
He know all
downtown free parking spot.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.131
- What you talking?
- Nothing.

10:00.334 --> 10:02.100
You're not
telling me something?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.969
No.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.907
Well, if it's about Janet,
she already tell me.

10:08.909 --> 10:11.009
About, uh, you know...

10:11.278 --> 10:14.846
No. I don't know. Who?

10:15.282 --> 10:18.216
Boy.
She don't want to tell you.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.018
Worried you can't
keep secrets.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.120
Ha! She already tell me.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.688
That's what
she want you to think.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.358
- But I see her and Raj.
- Raj?

10:27.427 --> 10:29.160
- Raj Mehta?
- No.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.162
Raj, uh, smith.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.732
Okay.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.167
Janet really like him.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.403
And he's a good boy,
going to be doctor.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.906
And you like Mrs. Mehta.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.209
Besides, you sneak attack
so can't say anything.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.278
Janet is happy?

10:48.682 --> 10:50.048
Yeah.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.483
She act kind of weird.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.418
I think that means
she's happy.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.422
- Raj is nice to her?
- I think so.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.727
- How long you keep secret?
- Six hour.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.030
New record.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.438
Yo, I just got us
an amazing deal

11:13.440 --> 11:15.106
On a new couch,
delivery included.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.307
Oh! That's cool.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.076
What did I do?
Oh, yeah, not much.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.278
Just found a set sale
at a prop warehouse.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.982
- Delivery not included.
- Whoa.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.950
Roman pillars, new york city.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.919
A timber wolf.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.156
All of mankind's greatest
achievements in one van.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.458
- That's, uh...
- Awesome.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.060
I know. I was like,

11:35.062 --> 11:36.895
"get in the van before
they change their mind."

11:36.897 --> 11:38.863
- Is that a cauldron?
- You tell me.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.231
- It is.
- Now I know.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.933
Yeah, this is all great,

11:41.935 --> 11:43.368
But, uh, we should see
how it works

11:43.370 --> 11:45.103
In the space
before we commit to anything.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.349
See how it goes
with the new couch.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.107
Wolves go with everything.

11:51.845 --> 11:53.812
Looked a lot smaller
in the store.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.981
How'd they get it in here?

11:56.983 --> 11:58.883
Did I mention it was half-off?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.752
There's another half?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.426
Ah, Mrs. Mehta.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.095
Mr. Mehta.

12:10.097 --> 12:12.430
Mrs. Kim.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.267
You don't mind the kiss-kiss?

12:16.269 --> 12:17.469
Better her than me.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.105
- Hmm.
- Exciting news is at hand.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.373
Raj just told us he's engaged.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.142
Mr. Mehta:
I wanted to tell them.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.210
I know.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.811
Why Janet not tell us?

12:26.813 --> 12:27.979
I can see you are stunned.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.314
I know this is all
very sudden.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.815
Yeah, maybe too sudden.

12:30.817 --> 12:34.052
Yes, they're young,
but only by western standards.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.354
In the east, Raj would be
a grandfather by now.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.422
They're so happy,

12:37.424 --> 12:40.091
And Raj couldn't have chosen
a more charming girl.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.093
Yeah, well...

12:42.095 --> 12:43.095
Divya badhwar.

12:43.864 --> 12:46.064
Is that how you say
"congratulations"?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.899
No, it's her name.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.435
She went to school
with Raj and Janet, remember?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.137
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.205
Of course, you're invited
to the engagement party.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.374
There'll be many
eligible bachelors there.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.177
Maybe you'll finally find
a suitable match for Janet.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.278
Ah.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.420
Everyone be careful
with the upholstery.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.022
And the cauldron!

13:11.024 --> 13:13.324
But the couch is leather,
so be extra careful.

13:13.326 --> 13:18.096
The cauldron is fire,
so be extra, extra careful!

13:18.098 --> 13:19.898
Your place reminds me
of <i>storage wars.</i>

13:19.900 --> 13:21.266
Thanks.

13:21.835 --> 13:23.935
- Hi.
- Oh, hey. Um...

13:23.937 --> 13:25.036
Let me get your jacket.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.073
Oh, I can just put it
in the closet.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.310
- Oh.
- -Is this a walk-in?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.179
I think it's a bedroom.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.381
Like in <i>harry potter.</i>

13:36.383 --> 13:38.917
Hey, is this
a <i>harry potter</i> theme party?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.319
- I'll take that.
- Thanks.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.155
The baked brie just goes
in the oven for 10 minutes.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.990
Or over the cauldron for less.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.960
Oh, yeah, excuse the decor,
it's not really my thing.

13:48.962 --> 13:51.229
I'm just kind of crashing here
until I buy, you know.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.463
It's hilarious.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.500
- Hey, do you have kids?
- What? No.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.135
Jung just got a door.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.503
Where?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.138
He means that thing,
but it's stupid,

14:00.140 --> 14:01.339
I never use it.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.007
Um, would you guys
like some wine?

14:03.243 --> 14:06.411
- Yeah.
- I have a $30 bottle, a $35...

14:06.413 --> 14:07.612
Uh, I might even have an $80.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.847
Red or white?

14:09.749 --> 14:10.148
It's hard to say.
The bottles are pretty dark.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.083
Let's just say $35.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.323
Hey, guys, I might have
to leave early tonight.

14:18.325 --> 14:22.193
You can do whatever you want.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.195
Great.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.966
Appa,
you said you wouldn't tell.

14:27.968 --> 14:28.968
I'm sorry, Janet.

14:29.903 --> 14:30.969
I'm so sorry.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.638
It's okay.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.874
- You aren't mad at me?
- No.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.376
You did nothing wrong,
you hear me?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.577
- Nothing.
- Okay.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.112
I just thought you'd be upset

14:41.114 --> 14:42.580
'cause he's not
a christian or Korean.

14:42.582 --> 14:46.384
No. Here. These are for you.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.053
Clearly, someone's sick,
dying or dead.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.356
Janet,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.292
Raj is engaged.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.043
- What are you talking about?
- He's getting married.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.199
Not to you.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.473
Yeah, I know.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.109
Like I said, things between us
were totally casual.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.911
- No strings, no commitment.
- Yeah.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.480
- No commitment to you.
- Appa.

15:15.482 --> 15:19.550
I'm fine. I'm 100% coolio.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.552
Mehta men.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.622
I'm going to do
some hapkido to Raj.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.558
No, first, yell,
then do hapkido to Raj,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.661
Then yell more
while I do hapkido to Raj!

15:29.996 --> 15:32.297
No! You're not gonna say
or do anything

15:32.299 --> 15:33.731
To Raj or the Mehtas.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.667
This is my business
and I'll handle it.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.535
Okay.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.404
Yeah.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.107
I'm totally fine.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.243
And I'm gonna eat
these pork rinds

15:45.245 --> 15:47.512
Like a totally
fine person would.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.646
With ice cream!

15:55.221 --> 15:57.455
What the hell, man?
You make fun of the door?

15:57.457 --> 15:59.223
I carried that home
on the subway for you.

15:59.225 --> 16:00.291
Dude, relax.

16:02.128 --> 16:02.410
So, my place is good enough

16:02.411 --> 16:02.693
To take you in,
but not for you to live in?

16:02.696 --> 16:04.262
According to you,
I'm just a guest, so...

16:04.264 --> 16:06.698
What kind of guest has a couch
that you can see from space?

16:06.700 --> 16:09.400
I love this couch.
It's a riot.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.269
Babe, did you see this couch?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.171
Yes, obviously.

16:13.373 --> 16:14.539
I mean...

16:14.541 --> 16:16.007
Both of you, uh,
sleep on the couch?

16:16.343 --> 16:17.976
Of course, they don't.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.310
- You don't, do you?
- No.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.312
Good.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.614
Okay, if everybody
could just stop eating,

16:23.616 --> 16:25.216
Or drinking near the couch,

16:25.218 --> 16:26.718
That would be great,
thank you.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.988
And could you stop
putting coats in my room?

16:29.990 --> 16:30.855
It's not a closet.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.757
Then stop hanging clothes
on the wolf,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.025
He's not a closet, either.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.094
The dog is perfect for it.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.496
Not a dog, boreal predator.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.398
And your room is
perfect for coats

16:40.533 --> 16:43.768
Because it has a door now!

16:43.770 --> 16:45.670
Sorry,
- we had a chip situation.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.832
Where should I put the broom?

16:47.574 --> 16:49.218
- Just leave it.
- I'll put it in the closet.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.375
What?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.379
Fine. You want
the coats off the dog?

16:56.049 --> 16:57.749
Kimch, it was an accident.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.221
Dude, what the hell
is your problem?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.456
Do you have any idea
how much this couch costs?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.191
Do you know how much
that wolf cost?

17:07.193 --> 17:08.459
It's your own fault!

17:08.461 --> 17:10.228
Bringing in a couch
that's so expensive

17:10.230 --> 17:11.662
Into a place that's so crappy.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.097
That's what you think, right?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.065
You wanna know what I think?

17:14.067 --> 17:16.167
No problem. You know
what takes out red wine?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.169
White wine.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.771
No, no. That's the $80 bottle.

17:21.007 --> 17:23.541
- Food fight!
- Ow!

17:23.543 --> 17:24.442
Sorry.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.677
Look, maybe
everybody should just leave.

17:26.679 --> 17:28.279
It's clear that some of us
aren't wanted.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.081
Yeah,
maybe some of you aren't.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.016
It's your place, your call.

17:34.788 --> 17:38.222
Yeah, sorry, I kind of invited
some more people.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.657
I hope there's enough room
on the couch.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.527
Oh, yeah!

17:42.529 --> 17:45.830
This is the second best night
of my life.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.600
Also, someone is burning
a cheese flag in the cauldron.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.842
I am pretty sure
that's illegal.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.410
Hi, Mr. Kim, is Janet around?

18:02.248 --> 18:05.316
Maybe you not talk
to Janet anymore.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.386
Maybe you not to talk
to anyone anymore.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.520
Appa, I got this.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.660
I'm so sorry.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.528
I should've told you
about Divya,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.497
But I figured we both knew
this was casual.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.432
Sure, we weren't serious,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.534
But you were seriously
not serious.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.570
- I know, and I...
- Divya badhwar?

18:27.073 --> 18:30.575
We went to school together.
What is wrong with you?

18:30.577 --> 18:33.144
- Janet...
- I am not upset.

18:33.313 --> 18:37.882
I am angry, and sometimes
I cry when I'm angry.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.118
These tears are not for you,
they're for me

18:40.120 --> 18:42.286
For wasting so much time
with you.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.288
You just...

18:44.891 --> 18:47.625
You is horrible boy
who make terrible choice!

18:47.627 --> 18:49.894
You don't deserve Janet.

18:49.896 --> 18:54.599
She is most special,
most beautiful, most talented!

18:56.703 --> 18:58.870
These tears are not for you,
either.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.272
I'm sorry.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.377
I didn't mean to upset you.

19:06.379 --> 19:07.411
Or you.

19:12.619 --> 19:15.820
Yeah, I think he learned
his lesson, huh?

19:16.623 --> 19:17.822
Thanks, appa.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.726
Come. We eat from
our sad-food group.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.695
Starting with
cookie dough ice cream.

19:24.697 --> 19:27.865
- And peanut butter.
- And cheez doodles.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.134
Did he fall off the balcony
or was he thrown?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.509
I think he jumped.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.679
- It's a ceramic dog.
- He was a timber wolf.

19:41.915 --> 19:43.281
Just the two of you live here?

19:43.283 --> 19:44.916
No one hiding in the bedroom
or the closet?

19:44.918 --> 19:46.517
Uh, that's also a bedroom.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.352
My bad.

19:49.355 --> 19:49.887
Look, I got a complaint,
so I have to write a report.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.290
Whose place is it?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.591
It's both of ours.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.660
Well, I've just been kinda
staying here for a bit.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.396
No. This is your home now.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.730
Guys, I just need a name.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.299
- Split the fine?
- Fifty-fifty?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.367
It's not a fine,
it's just a warning.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.735
Oh, then you can put
my name down.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.304
- Or mine.
- You know what?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.705
Put down both of our names.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.707
That way, it's official.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.775
I don't know your names.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.745
- Terence.
- Alejandro.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.017
Don't worry, Janet.

20:20.019 --> 20:21.552
One day,
you'll find a good boy.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.587
I know.

20:22.589 --> 20:23.988
Maybe not today,

20:23.990 --> 20:26.324
Maybe not tomorrow,
but one day.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.993
Maybe in the late fall, huh?
Sweater season.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.729
Everybody looks good
in a sweater, huh?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.764
- Mmm-hmm.
- Who it?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.499
- Um, mark.
- You know him?

20:35.501 --> 20:38.603
Yeah, he's 23. Has a pet bird.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.672
- Mmm, sound strange.
- Mmm, you're right. Not him.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.708
What about him?

20:43.710 --> 20:45.943
Why is he taking a selfie
picture in the bathroom?

20:45.945 --> 20:47.945
Yeah,
I don't like him, either.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.647
Next.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.815
No.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.049
No.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.517
No. Stop.

20:53.886 --> 20:57.054
Jacob, 21, likes windsurfing.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.359
- Appa?
- Shh.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.628
Trying to picture
Jacob windsurfing.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.063
Yeah, he's pretty good.

21:06.065 --> 21:08.032
- Should we keep him?
- Yeah.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.768
Now, what's
this video game called?

21:10.770 --> 21:11.902
- Dating.
- Hmm.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.305
Maybe it's better
as a single-player game, hmm?

21:14.307 --> 21:15.307
I think so.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.911
You better not get high score.
