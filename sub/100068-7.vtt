WEBVTT

00:05.657 --> 00:06.919
I love you.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.536
ANNOUNCER: FXX presents...

00:14.579 --> 00:17.147
It's Always Sunny
in Philadelphia.

00:19.149 --> 00:20.977
RADIO DJ:
101.3 WNFY weather report.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.675
It's a scorcher out there,
already 102 degrees.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.113
Residents are being asked
to keep their thermostats

00:26.156 --> 00:28.289
at 76 degrees
to conserve energy.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.292
Ah, man, global warming.
It's out of control.

00:31.335 --> 00:32.509
Yeah. It's hot, baby.

00:32.554 --> 00:35.165
Guys, we don't really have to
worry about global warming,

00:35.209 --> 00:37.776
because-- yes, is the Earth
getting unbearably hot?

00:37.820 --> 00:40.127
Of course it is. But it's all
a part of God's plan.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.867
Look, if God wants
to roast us like turkeys,

00:41.911 --> 00:43.260
there's got to be
a good reason for it.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.654
That's easy for you to say;
you're young.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.873
You know who's gonna
get hurt the worst?

00:47.917 --> 00:49.875
-Old people.
-Old people?

00:49.919 --> 00:51.312
-Yeah.-No, it's the younger generationthat's gonna suffer

00:51.355 --> 00:52.922
-from global warming the most.
-DENNIS: Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.489
Listen, there's no reason
to fight, okay?

00:54.532 --> 00:56.926
We're actually living ata very exciting time right now.

00:56.969 --> 00:58.362
I mean, we're all finally
in agreement

00:58.406 --> 01:00.321
that climate change is real.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.366
Well, yes, the 25 years
of climate science

01:02.410 --> 01:04.281
finally caught up with
my opinions, and, Dennis,

01:04.325 --> 01:07.328
when opinions meet facts,
that's when you get truth.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.546
-Oh, God.
-DEE: Wow.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.374
Yeah, yeah.
But the good news is, hey,

01:10.418 --> 01:11.723
for the first time
I can remember,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.725
we all have the same truth.

01:13.769 --> 01:15.597
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh...
-DENNIS: Yeah.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.381
-That's nice, right? Yeah.
-How 'bout that?

01:17.425 --> 01:18.469
And, look, while some people
are saying,

01:18.513 --> 01:20.036
"Look, we're staring down
the barrel

01:20.080 --> 01:22.473
of a global catastrophe here,"
that is true, but I think

01:22.517 --> 01:24.997
if we all work together,
we can solve this problem.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.392
-Guys, we can beat the heat.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
Oh! Hey!

01:30.090 --> 01:32.309

Feeling that?
Nice and cool, huh?

02:06.387 --> 02:08.215
Turned the AC waydown.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.216
Yeah, I don't know why

02:09.258 --> 02:11.783
we're wasting our AC
on strangers.

02:11.827 --> 02:13.394
No, Frank, we're not wasting it.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.396
No-no-no-no. We're adapting
to climate change.

02:15.439 --> 02:17.267
People are animals.

02:17.311 --> 02:19.051
When push comes to shove,

02:19.095 --> 02:21.315
-there's no "together."
-No-no-no, see, listen.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.013
By-by-by cranking the AC down
below the recommended,

02:24.056 --> 02:25.884
uh, settings,
and getting the word out

02:25.928 --> 02:27.625
that Paddy's has
the best AC in town,

02:27.669 --> 02:29.410
we're actually
helping our business

02:29.453 --> 02:31.238
and helping the environment.

02:31.281 --> 02:32.456
No, that doesn't work.
Shame's better.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.328
Like I do with my shoes,
you know what I mean?

02:34.371 --> 02:36.460
How would I know what you mean?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.636
My shoes that are made out of
recyclable materials.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.247
I did a whole Instagram Story
about it.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.857
Talking about
how great the shoes are,

02:41.900 --> 02:43.380
making people feel stupid
for not having them.

02:43.424 --> 02:44.816
You know, you remember.

02:44.860 --> 02:48.255
Who the fuck do you think
is watching your-- What?!

02:48.298 --> 02:50.300
-Not-not one person
on Earth is...
-Get out of here.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.433
What are you talking about?
Plus, how is there any plastic

02:52.476 --> 02:53.825
left in the ocean
after they used it

02:53.869 --> 02:55.827
to cover your gargantuan feet?

02:55.871 --> 02:57.873
-Yeah, big feet.
Hey, guys, though,

02:57.916 --> 02:59.309
we got a little bit
of a problem.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.790
Uh, there's, like, a,
I don't know, like, a backup

03:01.833 --> 03:03.444
of the water lines or something.The ice machine's broken.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.662
We don't have any ice.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.490
Oh, shit. Okay, well,
just, uh, call the store

03:06.534 --> 03:08.057
and have them deliver some ice.

03:08.100 --> 03:11.495
And make more waste by having
a big smoke-spewing truck

03:11.539 --> 03:13.932
deliver ice to us when we couldjust simply get off our asses

03:13.976 --> 03:16.370
and go get it ourselves?
Hey, guys,

03:16.413 --> 03:18.850
listen, I just wanted to talk
about the importance

03:18.894 --> 03:22.854
of not only talking the talk,
but also walking the walk.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.466
Oh. As I'm saying that,
it's reminding me

03:25.509 --> 03:28.512
I'm loving
my new eco-friendly shoes.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.036
See there? Not only
am I helping the environment,

03:31.080 --> 03:32.429
I could also get some free swag

03:32.473 --> 03:34.605
-if I keep it up,
play my cards right.
-DENNIS: That's awesome.

03:34.649 --> 03:35.954
You're such
an awesome eco-warrior.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.260
And since you want
to walk the walk,

03:37.304 --> 03:40.045
why don't youwalk to the store
and pick us up some ice?

03:40.089 --> 03:42.309
-I just might.
-Okay, then do it.

03:42.352 --> 03:45.834
-Maybe I will.
-Get out and go!

03:45.877 --> 03:48.967
Could even do an InstagramStory about it on my way there.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.491
Oh, super cool!

03:51.927 --> 03:53.320
-DENNIS and FRANK: Go!
-Fine.
-Go, go and go

03:53.363 --> 03:55.496
-and go and go and go and go
and go, go, go and go.
-Fine!

03:55.539 --> 03:57.715
Charlie, come with me;
I need someone to video me

03:57.759 --> 03:59.151
so I look more professional.

03:59.195 --> 04:00.501
I don't want to do that.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.198
We'll do a Story about Purina,

04:02.242 --> 04:04.331
tag them, and get you
a free case of cat food.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.289
-Done.
-Hmm.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.552
Did you see that, Frank?

04:08.596 --> 04:10.554
If you incentivize somebody
to make the right decision,

04:10.598 --> 04:12.556
you can get them to do
whatever you need them to do.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.689
All right, what about me?
Where's my incentive?

04:14.732 --> 04:17.430
Well, uh, how about
we lower that AC even more

04:17.474 --> 04:19.302
and see if that helps you?

04:19.346 --> 04:21.565
How would that help me?

04:21.608 --> 04:24.568
Frank, what's the temperature
at which a certain body part's

04:24.612 --> 04:27.963
small, smooth muscle cells
contract, thereby decreasing

04:28.006 --> 04:31.358
the surface area of the skin,
causing that certain body part

04:31.401 --> 04:34.578
to protrude
in an unusual fashion?

04:34.622 --> 04:36.580
65.7 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:36.624 --> 04:39.322
-Make it so.
-I'll do it.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.324
What are you guys talking about?

04:41.368 --> 04:43.805
Nipples, Mac. Uh, nipples.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.937
Hi.

04:47.504 --> 04:50.333
Son of a bitch charged me $40
for a bag of ice, Charlie.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.596
They-- he's taking advantage
of this heat wave,

04:52.640 --> 04:54.381
-jacking up the prices.
-Yeah, he's smart.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.252
-So what's going on with the
feet? I see you limping here.
-Ah!

04:56.296 --> 04:57.688
Yeah, you know what?
These shoes, they are,

04:57.732 --> 04:58.950
they're the worst.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.430
Well, my feet are
all blistered and swollen.

05:00.474 --> 05:03.738
-Yeah?
-But they're so cute
and totally on-brand.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.522
-Uh-huh.
-What are you doing?
Don't do the Story now.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.828
Well, you told me
to shoot candid moments

05:06.871 --> 05:08.830
-that seemed honest.
-I said staged moments

05:08.873 --> 05:11.049
that lookedcandid
and seemedhonest.

05:11.093 --> 05:13.400
All right, well, can we justwalk back to the bar? Let's go.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.576
I-I don't know. I honestly
don't think I can walk back.

05:15.619 --> 05:16.838
My feet are killing me.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.535
Let's take the bus, then.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.798
Do you have any ideahow much pollution a bus causes?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.539
I don't know. Uh, three?

05:24.106 --> 05:25.368
Three?

05:26.804 --> 05:29.416
-Three what?
-Pollutions?

05:29.459 --> 05:30.982
-All right, we're not...
-I-I'm not a scient--

05:31.026 --> 05:32.636
-I'm not a scientist.
-We're not--
You're not a scientist.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.421
I get it. We're not
taking the bus, though,

05:34.464 --> 05:36.640
because buses are wastefuland more importantly disgusting.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.773
You're just all crammed on there
with a bunch of mongrels

05:38.816 --> 05:40.992
breathing directly intoyour mouth. There's no room. No.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.429
Plus it's the future, Charlie.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.605
-We can just take a rideshare.
-Rideshare? Why--

05:44.648 --> 05:47.390
-What?
-Yeah. It's when a bunch
of people get the app,

05:47.434 --> 05:49.784
and then y'all take the same
vehicle to different places.

05:49.827 --> 05:51.829
Same vehicle, diff--
so, like a bus.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.092
Fine, but it's not a bus,
it's a car.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.834
-So less room.
-Okay. Uh-huh.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.445
'Cause if we just
take the bus...

05:58.488 --> 06:00.272
-We're not taking
a bus, Charlie!
-Okay.

06:00.316 --> 06:02.449
-Taking the rideshare. Come on.-All right. Well...

-Hold on.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.638
-I thought you turned the AC up?It's getting hot as hell.
-I did.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.204
I did, but there's
too many people here.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.989
I can't offset the body heat.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.470
-Hey, we got a problem.
-Yeah, I-- yeah, I saw that.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.515
What's with all the water, man?What's going on here?

06:25.559 --> 06:27.430
MAC:
Oh, that is probably from

06:27.474 --> 06:29.084
the ice machine breaking down.

06:29.127 --> 06:31.303
The water got backed up
and maybe diverted over here.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.609
But that's not
what I'm talking about.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.611
-What?
-Look.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.657
The fish factory guys
heard about the AC.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.441
Now they'rehanging out.

06:38.485 --> 06:41.009
-Nobody wants to go near them.
-Yeah, well, they're covered
in fish parts.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.141
They probably smell like shit.
Go kick them out, Mac.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.708
Uh, well, they go to my church.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.798
And if I kick them out, then
they'll tattle on me to God.

06:47.842 --> 06:51.019
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.107

You know, Dennis,

06:52.150 --> 06:54.544
I'm not very incentivized here.

07:01.682 --> 07:04.511
Talking about the nipples.
I don't see any.

07:04.554 --> 07:05.947
-Oh. Right, right. Sorry.
Your, um...
-Not... people.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.601
Yeah, no, your track record
in that department

07:07.644 --> 07:09.254
is, uh, it's not great.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.082
Yeah, it's just that
his misogyny is stronger

07:11.126 --> 07:12.693

-In this case.

-In this case.

07:32.626 --> 07:36.107
Hey, guys. Hey, why createan even bigger carbon footprint

07:36.151 --> 07:38.762
by taking stinky buses all over
town when you can just hop

07:38.806 --> 07:41.765
in a, in a, in a rideshare,
in an electric vehicle?

07:41.809 --> 07:43.114

Stop saying "and cut," Charlie.Just take your finger

off the button.
You don't have to say that.

the AC up, please?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.131
-We're dying back here.
-DRIVER: Uh, sorry,
electric car.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.916
AC kills the battery.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.787
Okay, then just turn it on
for a minute

08:03.831 --> 08:05.354
and then turn it right back off.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.747
Want me to open a window?

08:06.790 --> 08:09.445
No. No, I actually don't want
hot air from the outside

08:09.489 --> 08:11.534
blowing all over the place,
but thank you.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.754
You want a breath mint
or some gum?

08:13.797 --> 08:15.103
I want some goddamn
air conditioning.

08:15.146 --> 08:16.626
What's some gum gonna do?

08:16.670 --> 08:19.977
Well, when someone offers
you gum, it's usually a hint.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.762
-That's him! That's not me.
-Uh, well,

08:21.805 --> 08:24.199
-it's both of you.
It's both of you.
-Uh...

08:26.418 --> 08:27.811
I'm gonna give you
one star, jerk!

08:27.855 --> 08:30.684
Maybe consider getting
some gum for those pits!

08:30.727 --> 08:32.337
What an ass-- Hey, everybody.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.818
Just coming back
from a real quick trip.

08:34.861 --> 08:35.993
We walked to the store

08:36.037 --> 08:38.212
and then we took
a fantastic rideshare home.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.693
-And we got a really awesome
bag of ice to show for it.

08:40.736 --> 08:41.825
-And stop!
-What? What are you doing?

08:41.869 --> 08:43.260
Well, you don't want me
to say "cut,"

08:43.304 --> 08:44.611
-so I'll say "stop."
It's better.
-Well, I wanted

08:44.654 --> 08:46.177
to bring the ice up intothe frame so I could show them--

08:46.221 --> 08:48.745
-and don't say, don't say
"cut" or "stop," just stop.
-Oh, okay.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.617
All right? Let's do it again.
Where is the ice?

08:50.660 --> 08:52.619
-Uh, the ice is melted.
Yeah, not much left.
-Uh...

08:52.662 --> 08:55.273
-What?!
-It was super hot
in that car, Dee.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.492
Oh, Christ!

08:56.536 --> 08:58.059
-Cat food, please?
-Not--

08:58.102 --> 08:59.974
We're not gonna get the cat food'cause we--

09:00.017 --> 09:02.454
-I can't go back in there
without d-- Hey!
-And go!

09:02.498 --> 09:03.804
We're just getting ice out here.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.501
-And stop.
-Beating the heat.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.155
Hey...

09:07.198 --> 09:08.722
-fans.
-And stop!

09:08.765 --> 09:11.202
I'm going to murder you.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.639
-Whoa, you're freaking out.
-Yes.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.380
I amfreaking out.
Film when I say "film."

09:15.424 --> 09:16.643
Hey, everybody.

09:16.686 --> 09:17.600
-You said "film."
-All good. It's just hot.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.168
It's just so hot. And cut.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.649
-You saying "cut" now?
-I say "cut," not you!

09:22.692 --> 09:25.303
-All right, I got a plan.
-It's hard to follow
all your rules, Dee.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.741
-Just shut up!
We're gonna call a car.
-Uh-huh.

09:27.784 --> 09:29.699
We're gonna get in the car.
We're gonna go get ice.

09:29.743 --> 09:31.222
We're gonna come back
with a bag of ice,

09:31.266 --> 09:32.659
and we're gonna shove it
in their face...

09:32.702 --> 09:34.269
So we're taking two cars
when we could've taken one car

09:34.312 --> 09:35.531
or called the truck
and this whole thing

09:35.575 --> 09:36.967
could've been done,
like, hours ago.

09:37.011 --> 09:39.666
-Okay. We'll walk.
But stop talking to me!
-Okay, we'll walk.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.624
-And I'm rolling.
-Hi. We're just gonna walk
to get some more ice.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.850
♪ I said it's getting hot
in here, so hot♪

09:49.893 --> 09:51.678
♪ So take off all your clothes♪

09:51.721 --> 09:55.769
♪ I am getting too hot,  I want to take my clothes off

09:55.812 --> 09:58.249
♪ Oh, it's getting hot in here,
so hot♪

09:58.293 --> 10:00.034
♪ So take off all your clothes♪

10:00.077 --> 10:01.688
♪ I am getting...♪

10:01.731 --> 10:02.993
Hey, Frank.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.822
Global warming
is the fucking best.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.781
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

10:07.824 --> 10:09.478
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Over here.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.697
Ah.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.220
-Yeah.
-DENNIS: All right, guys.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.874
Listen, we got another problem,all right?

10:13.917 --> 10:15.789
We're running out of glasses
and I can't run the dishwasher

10:15.832 --> 10:17.268
'cause it's too big
of a power suck.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.530
It's gonna kill the AC.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.097
I got a fix. We got this stuff

10:20.141 --> 10:22.665
back when we were gonna
have the Memorial Day party,

10:22.709 --> 10:25.494
but then we had to cancel it
because of the blizzard.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.496
-Oh! You bought the-- yeah!
-Yeah!

10:27.539 --> 10:29.324
-That's working together, baby.-It's plastic.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.718
-DENNIS: Nice work.
-The Lord provideth again!

10:31.761 --> 10:33.807
No, Mac! No.
The Lord not provideth.

10:33.850 --> 10:35.809
Frank provideth. He's the one
who bought the cups.

10:35.852 --> 10:36.853
Frank provideth.

10:36.897 --> 10:39.682
That-- well, the Lord provideththe snowstorm in May

10:39.726 --> 10:41.553
that allowed us
to get the cups now.

10:41.597 --> 10:44.687
-Uh-huh.
-See? It's all a part
of his divine plan, Dennis.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.733
And that's locked in,
so we're good.

10:46.776 --> 10:48.517
Okay, so all we have
to do is nothing?

10:48.560 --> 10:50.519
No. No, because, uh,
we have free will, Dennis,

10:50.562 --> 10:53.130
which means that, um, we have
to take the necessary steps

10:53.174 --> 10:55.785
to make sure that that plan
comes to fruition.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.047
-Which is predetermined.
-Yes.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.875
But it doesn't matter what we doif it's all predetermined.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.269
You see how your argument
doesn't make any sense?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.706
Uh, that's correct. But it
doesn't have to make sense,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.926
because that's where
the faith comes in.

11:05.969 --> 11:09.059
Right? I have faith that
what I'm saying makes sense.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.931
Okay, so even
if it doesn't make sense,

11:10.974 --> 11:12.280
your faith makes it make sense.

11:12.323 --> 11:14.108
-Correct.-Got it. Okay, so there's no way

11:14.151 --> 11:15.849
to have a rational conversation
with you.

11:15.892 --> 11:17.851
-No.-Climate change affects us all.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.374
Okay? We're all in this
together. All right?

11:19.417 --> 11:21.593
We need to work together, and wecan still make a profit, okay?

11:21.637 --> 11:23.987
Don't worry. Just let me think
about how to make this work.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.163
Well, think fast, because
it's getting hotter in here

11:26.207 --> 11:27.774
and people
are gonna start dying.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.210
I got an idea. I got an idea.

11:29.253 --> 11:30.994
Look, the-the music,
it's very, very up-tempo.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.344
What if we throw a couple
slow jams in here, all right?

11:33.388 --> 11:35.346
Drop the body heat down a notch.

11:35.390 --> 11:36.913
-FRANK: Let's do it.
-That's an excellent idea.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.350
And don't you see
how God came through you

11:39.394 --> 11:40.743
to come up with that idea?

11:40.787 --> 11:42.571
Go turn-- change the music.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.791
-Change the music.
-I'll go change the music.
I'm-a change the music.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.793
-Son of a bitch.

11:46.836 --> 11:48.969
Charged me
20 extra bucks for this one.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.579
-Want me to film this rant?
-No!

11:50.622 --> 11:52.581
Obviously I don't. What is this?What have you done?

11:52.624 --> 11:54.583
Well, I got a nice little
trash bag-- that's keeping me

11:54.626 --> 11:56.585
a little bit cooler-- and then
this totally creates shade.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.760
You want me to make you a hat?

11:57.804 --> 12:00.154
No, thanks. I don't want
to wear trash on my head.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.764
You're wearing it on your feet.

12:01.808 --> 12:03.592
I paid 90 bucks
for these things.

12:03.635 --> 12:05.028
Well, I can charge you
for the hat if it

12:05.072 --> 12:05.942
-makes you feel better.
-No, that's not the point

12:05.986 --> 12:07.770
-I was making, but the...
-Oh, all right.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.424
My shoes do suck.
My feet are dead.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.817
Let's just call another car
and get back

12:10.860 --> 12:13.776
to the bar
before this ice melts again.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.604
Oh, goddamn it.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.432
-What's wrong?
-My account's been suspended.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.826
That driver gave me one star,
citing "verbal abuse"

12:19.869 --> 12:22.219
and saying I urinated all
over the backseat of his car.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.004
That was melted ice.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.049
Actually, I did pee
back there a little bit.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.573
-I did, too.
It was a very long ride.
-You did? I thought you did.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.401
-I did. Yeah.
But that's not the point.
-Ah, all right.

12:30.445 --> 12:32.664
The point is we're stuck now.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.884
Unless we take the bus.

12:40.977 --> 12:42.500
Goddamn it.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.074
How did it get hotter?

12:51.118 --> 12:53.207
I don't know, man.I think the slow jams backfired.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.209
It's like all the friction
from the grinding,

12:55.252 --> 12:56.950
like, created a closed system.

12:56.993 --> 13:00.083
I didn't accountfor all the increased sexiness.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.693
There's a lot of
rumblings coming from

13:01.737 --> 13:03.521
-the water section, too, there.-DENNIS: Well, that's 'cause

13:03.565 --> 13:05.306
they're not reusing the cups.
You know what I mean?

13:05.349 --> 13:07.047
They don't have any cups left.
They're throwing all the trash

13:07.090 --> 13:09.049
-in the water.
-And they want more booze.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.442
-Which, by the way,
we don't have any.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.835
We didn't have enough
to accommodate the people

13:12.879 --> 13:15.098
that were here before,
and now it seems like

13:15.142 --> 13:17.971
we've doubled in size
and we just don't have enough.

13:18.014 --> 13:19.886
-Where is your God now?
-Yeah, Mac.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.279
-He will reveal himself
at some point.
-Oh.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.326
Well, is he gonna do it
before all these people revolt

13:25.369 --> 13:27.110
-and destroy the place?
-All right...

13:27.154 --> 13:28.720
I don't know, Frank.
I don't question God's will.

13:28.764 --> 13:30.113
If he wants to destroy
the Earth, that's on him.

13:30.157 --> 13:31.462
-I support it!
-What are you talking about?

13:31.506 --> 13:32.986
Guys-guys, stop--
Okay, stop bickering.

13:33.029 --> 13:34.291
We can't be bickering.
Okay, look.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.206
We said we were gonna
beat the heat together.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.555
As a team, as a community.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.905
And that's what we're
gonna do, goddamn it.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.863
I got it. I got it.

13:40.907 --> 13:41.995
Hey, uh, everybody, if I could
get your attention, please.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.213
I got a quick announcement.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.041
If everybody could just
listen up real quick.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.782
-Dennis has an announcement.
-Yeah, I have an annou--

13:46.826 --> 13:48.131
You don't need to announce
my announcement.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.350
Okay.

13:49.393 --> 13:51.743
Idiot. Um, okay, uh, so, guys,

13:51.787 --> 13:53.310
uh, are you guys
having a good time?

13:53.354 --> 13:55.356
-What a great party, huh?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.099
That's right, that's right.
But check this out.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.709
Check this out.
Here's my announcement.

14:00.752 --> 14:03.059
We do need to chill out
on the dancing a little bit,

14:03.103 --> 14:05.105
'cause we-we're overworking
that AC, but...

14:05.148 --> 14:07.455
-Now, now, no, no, I get it,

14:07.498 --> 14:08.978
I get it, I get it, I get it.

14:09.022 --> 14:10.153
Listen, you think
I want to be that guy?

14:10.197 --> 14:12.721
I don't want to be that guy,
but I think if we just

14:12.764 --> 14:15.115
stop dancing for just a second,the AC can catch up,

14:15.158 --> 14:16.943
this place can cool down.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.031
I don't want to stop.

14:18.074 --> 14:19.554
You don't want to stop?
Yeah, I know.

14:19.597 --> 14:20.947
Nobody wants to stop.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.905
We're all having a good time.
But maybe we just, like--

14:22.949 --> 14:24.167
Uh, you know what?
Let's not stop.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.039
Let's not stop at all.
Let's just chill out.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.954
We'll chill out for a second,
you know what I mean?

14:27.997 --> 14:29.564
We'll chill out.
We'll slow things down.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.740
-I don't want to slow down.
-Okay, listen,

14:31.783 --> 14:33.176
I know you don't want
to slow down, I get it.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.612
Nobody wants to slow down.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.701
It's all good, but we got
to work together, right?

14:36.745 --> 14:39.095
We got to, we got to worktogether to keep this place cool

14:39.139 --> 14:40.749
and to keep everything kosher,
all right?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.620
One other announcement:
uh, we're running a little low

14:42.664 --> 14:44.361
on tequila and other liquors.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.538
All right, so...

14:47.582 --> 14:49.149
I'm not talking
crazy stuff here.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.064
We got plenty to go around,
all right?

14:51.107 --> 14:53.153
Maybe instead of ten shots,
we do, like, five or six.

14:53.196 --> 14:54.371
That's it. You know?

14:54.415 --> 14:56.330
I... I-I want ten shots.

14:56.373 --> 14:57.984
You want ten shots,
but, you know,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.595
ten shots is too much for you
and five to six is plenty.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.336
-Don't tell her what she needs.-

15:02.379 --> 15:05.078
Stop. Everybody st-- O-Okay.
I get it. Look, l-let's not...

15:05.121 --> 15:06.862
You're losing them,
you're losing them!

15:06.906 --> 15:09.125
All right, look, I'm not tryingto bring the mood down, guys.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.562
This is-- It's all good. Okay?
Just-- let's just recognize

15:11.606 --> 15:13.390
that just-- whoa, pal.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:13.434 --> 15:14.435
Okay, look, stop.

15:14.478 --> 15:15.610
I'm just saying we're in

15:15.653 --> 15:17.220
a little bit
of a tricky situation here.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.134
We can figure this out.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.136
Just, it's getting
real hot in here.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.182
Okay? And we're running
a little low on resources.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.792
It's fine.

15:23.835 --> 15:26.099
W-We... But if we adapt,
we'll keep the party going

15:26.142 --> 15:29.058
for a long, long time.
So who's with me?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.423
-I got the booze!

16:02.265 --> 16:04.137
Oh, my God.
That bus was hot as shit.

16:04.180 --> 16:07.009
-The third bus was the hottest,you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.011
It's those local buses.
We should've just gotten off

16:09.055 --> 16:11.100
-at the express and walked,
but that's...
-It's all the buses.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.232
-They're bad.
-Whoo.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.885
Please tell me
the ice didn't melt.

16:13.929 --> 16:16.062
Uh, no, but somebody
ripped a hole in the bag

16:16.105 --> 16:17.280
-and stole it. Yeah.
-What?!

16:17.324 --> 16:19.108
-How did you not notice that?
-Oh, I don't know.

16:19.152 --> 16:21.415
My back must have gone numb
from the ice on my back.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.286
-You know what I mean?
-Oh, no. No.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.288
-I can't go all the way back
to that store. I can't do it.
-Oh, no.

16:25.332 --> 16:26.202
No, that's too many vehicles.

16:26.246 --> 16:28.204
But how are your feet
feeling, though?

16:28.248 --> 16:29.640
Oh, I got to say, though,

16:29.684 --> 16:31.294
Charlie, the feet
are feeling real good.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.904
-Whatever you made...-I'm pretty proud of that shoe.

16:32.948 --> 16:35.255
-Uh, you should be.
-Yeah. That's the
medical sponge, which is...

16:35.298 --> 16:37.300
-I don't want to hear
any of the details, though.
-Oh, okay.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.432
-I'll spare you.
-Okay? Thank you.

16:38.475 --> 16:40.086
Whoo.
So what's the plan now?

16:40.129 --> 16:42.088
I got one last idea.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.528
Hey, oh! Ice!

16:47.571 --> 16:49.312
We got ice.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.140
What's going on in here?
Who are these guys?

16:51.184 --> 16:52.315
DENNIS:
Uh, these are our friends

16:52.359 --> 16:53.882
from the fish factory.
What's up, guys?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.449
They're actually pretty gooddudes once you get to know them.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.886
Yeah, nice c-- not like the
people we had in here before.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.715
-They were terrible. -Uh, well, what happened
to the party, though?

17:00.758 --> 17:02.195
People were animals,
just like I said.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.240
All right, well,
while you guys were in here

17:04.284 --> 17:06.242
destroying the environment,
I got ice,

17:06.286 --> 17:08.243
with barely a carbon footprint.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.464
And I also made
a pretty sweet Insta Story

17:10.507 --> 17:12.683
to spread the word
and shame my followers.

17:12.727 --> 17:15.208
-Mm-hmm.
-Check it out.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.731
What up, Dee's Nuts?

17:16.773 --> 17:19.125
Just another important
Insta message for you.

17:19.167 --> 17:21.344
Don't forget to reduce,
reuse and...

17:21.387 --> 17:22.650
I'd rather drive six Hummers

17:22.693 --> 17:24.694
than smell
your shit breath, loser!

17:24.739 --> 17:26.348
Well, these shoes suck.
They're terrible.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.134
My feet are all blistered.
What are you doing? Don't...

17:28.176 --> 17:30.310
-You're the stupid idiot! Okay?-No. You put my ice bag down...

17:30.353 --> 17:32.355
I'm not putting the ice down!
I'm taking the ice!

17:32.399 --> 17:34.140
-I'll give your money this time.-Get the hell out of my store.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.359
But you try and gouge me again,you son of a bitch,

17:36.403 --> 17:37.578
I'll gouge your eyes out!

17:37.621 --> 17:38.796
There you go.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.146
Last time you get recycled.

17:40.189 --> 17:42.322
Hope a bird
chokes to death on you.

17:42.365 --> 17:45.151
I hate the bus!
Oh, you're disgusting!

17:45.194 --> 17:47.718
I can't stand being near
you low-life degenerates!

17:49.242 --> 17:53.115
Ah. Yeah. Not tipping you
either, so don't even ask.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.204
-CHARLIE: And cut.
-Okay, stop saying "and cut."

17:57.380 --> 18:00.209
Goddamn it, Charlie.
