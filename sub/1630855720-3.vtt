01:04.815 --> 01:07.401
Emma! Emma!

01:35.804 --> 01:38.974
Just don't hurt the baby.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.729
Just let my son go.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.565
"Just let my son go."

01:47.274 --> 01:49.735
He was surprised
those were the words he meant,

01:49.818 --> 01:52.946
surprised because a person
never knows how they will react

01:53.030 --> 01:54.406
in the worst of moments.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.450
Each of us hopes to be brave

01:56.950 --> 01:59.620
but how often do we get
the chance to find out?

02:00.204 --> 02:03.457
In this moment,
the thing he was willing to beg for

02:03.540 --> 02:05.626
was the life of his son.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.591
Okay. I'll die. I will.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.261
Just please put Brian in the hallway.

02:27.231 --> 02:28.315
Please.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.742
I am the god Apollo!

02:38.825 --> 02:40.661
I bring the power of the sun!

02:42.538 --> 02:44.998
Emma, I know it's been hard for you.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.708
You've been so broken.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.586
And I haven't helped. I know.
I only made it worse.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.464
But you're not alone in this, Emma.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.341
You remember what Kim told you, right?

02:54.925 --> 02:56.468
It happens to mothers all the time.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.886
Emma, you're not the only one.

02:59.096 --> 03:03.141
Emma! Emma, I can hear him screaming.
He sounds healthy.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.727
There's nothing done
that can't be fixed. Please.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.359
Okay.

03:14.278 --> 03:18.282
You-- You're Emma.
You're the mother of Brian.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.368
The sister of Kim.
The best friend of Michelle.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.912
The girl from Boones Mill. My wife.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.207
Emma would never hurt her only child.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.006
Emma!

03:48.145 --> 03:49.479
Don't hurt Brian.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.024
Don't hurt the baby.

03:53.817 --> 03:54.985
It's not a baby.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.087
Recovery.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.342
Defined as the regaining of
something lost or taken away.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.138
Recovery of a zygomatic orbital fracture.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.973
Reconstructed.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.642
Recovered.

06:04.406 --> 06:07.826
Bodies recover.
But what about the person? The soul?

06:08.744 --> 06:11.955
How long to regain
what has been lost or taken away?

06:14.416 --> 06:17.336
A son. A wife. A marriage.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.921
Three lives.

06:20.297 --> 06:24.384
What surgery, what ointment
could aid in their recovery?

06:52.871 --> 06:53.872
Hey.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.960
Over here. Come on.

07:05.968 --> 07:06.969
You shouldn't be here.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.556
What?

07:11.807 --> 07:13.475
Wait. What? Are you mad at me?

07:13.559 --> 07:15.102
No, hey, no one's angry.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.186
-I'm angry.
-What--

07:16.895 --> 07:18.438
I'm angry you came around our kids.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.607
Okay. Hold on. I…

07:21.149 --> 07:23.110
I don't--
I would never hurt your children.

07:23.193 --> 07:26.321
-You went in there with a gun.
-I know. But, look, I--

07:26.405 --> 07:27.865
The reason why I did that was because--

07:27.948 --> 07:29.491
Hey, man, look…

07:30.951 --> 07:33.954
I can't tell you how sorry
we are about Brian.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.125
But we just don't feel
comfortable with you here.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.878
We're just trying to be good dads.

07:43.046 --> 07:44.214
I was too.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.509
-Hey, look--
-I was too.

07:50.012 --> 07:51.013
I was too.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.268
You can't sleep here. You hear me?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.145
Get up.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.522
How did you get into this building?

08:02.733 --> 08:03.775
It's you.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.196
Fabian.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.743
Wow. They did a real good job on your eye.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.328
When I found you, it was all…

08:16.663 --> 08:17.664
not good.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.585
I've seen your mom around here
while you was locked up.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.963
She cleaned up your place
after the cops trashed it.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.550
You got out fast.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.220
-Three months.
-Yeah.

08:31.303 --> 08:35.349
Well, my mother used to work for a lawyer.

08:35.432 --> 08:38.809
He knew the prosecutor and the judge.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.313
Good mothers are a gift.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.820
Sorry. I didn't mean-- Sorry.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.373
What made you come there?
To the apartment that day.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.919
Number 47 said there was a…

09:06.255 --> 09:07.256
an odor.

09:08.966 --> 09:10.300
Never smelled nothing like it.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.678
A smell.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.430
Door was unlocked.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.060
It was real hot inside.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.023
I found you first.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.776
I thought you was dead. For real.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.195
Then I--

09:31.905 --> 09:32.990
Then I--

09:35.158 --> 09:36.451
Then I went to the back.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.251
-Found the baby. I saw the baby.
-What did you s-- What--

09:44.334 --> 09:45.377
Did she…

09:45.460 --> 09:47.421
I said a prayer for him right there.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.258
And every week since at church.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.139
Thank you.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.141
Thank you for that.

10:00.684 --> 10:02.186
I say a prayer for you too.

10:04.688 --> 10:05.814
I gotta go.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.786
Good afternoon, ladies.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.835
The way he looks at you.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.587
He's persistent.

10:29.338 --> 10:31.256
That means "relentless."

10:38.931 --> 10:41.808
Thank you, Mrs. Ortiz.

10:41.892 --> 10:45.854
You're welcome, Mrs. Lillian.
He's such a good boy.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.024
Thank you.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.861
My sweet boy.

10:53.695 --> 10:54.947
My sweet boy.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.915
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh.

11:06.959 --> 11:08.293
The Police?

11:08.377 --> 11:10.754
Every little thing she does is magic.

11:14.675 --> 11:15.676
Come.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.225
How's the boy?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.523
You're saying no.

11:29.606 --> 11:31.608
-I do appreciate everyth--
-Keep 'em.

11:35.988 --> 11:36.989
I'm sorry.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.577
I need you to work Saturdays from now on.

11:41.660 --> 11:42.661
I can't.

11:44.162 --> 11:47.165
That's impossible. You know I have Apollo.

11:47.249 --> 11:49.668
Saturday, 9 a.m. sharp.

12:03.265 --> 12:05.851
Please, I'm begging you, Mrs. Ortiz.

12:05.934 --> 12:10.022
I am so sorry.
I always see my mother on Saturdays.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.248
You are asking me
to leave a little boy alone.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.918
-Of course, you're the victim.
-I have no one.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.588
Punish me another way.
I need this job. I--

12:34.671 --> 12:35.923
You can leave at lunch.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.096
A half day, then.

12:45.849 --> 12:46.850
Yes.

12:50.854 --> 12:51.855
A half day.

13:15.379 --> 13:16.547
Okay, Apollo…

13:18.841 --> 13:21.552
Mommy's going to go out for a short while,

13:21.635 --> 13:23.762
but I'll be right back, okay?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.849
I'll let you watch the TV the entire time.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.725
Good deal?

13:35.232 --> 13:36.233
Hey.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.365
Okay.

14:14.563 --> 14:18.108
It just seems so unfair.
That's the part I can't get--

14:18.192 --> 14:20.194
We've already begun. Come on in.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.487
Welcome to The Survivors.

14:24.406 --> 14:29.244
Yeah, I've got this attendance sheet thing
that I need you to sign.

14:29.328 --> 14:31.079
-I'm supposed to--
-Why don't you have a seat?

14:32.748 --> 14:33.832
Right over there.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.422
I'm sorry, Vivian, you were sharing.

14:43.091 --> 14:47.554
It's a slippery slope.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.185
Anything can set me off.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.107
Yesterday the washing machine
stopped working and…

15:06.198 --> 15:07.407
and it broke me.

15:08.659 --> 15:10.244
Because I realized…

15:12.663 --> 15:14.957
he's the one who mended the broken things.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.420
-Thank you, Vivian. Thank you.
-Thank you.

15:21.797 --> 15:23.048
-Hi, I'm Julian.
-Thank you.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.800
-Hi, Julian.
-Hi, Julian.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.887
Man, y'all know my story,
but I'ma share for the newcomer.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.932
Phone-texting,
car rolls into an intersection,

15:32.015 --> 15:33.475
smashed by a moving truck.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.729
Not a truck that was moving,
it was moving,

15:37.813 --> 15:40.482
but a moving truck that you move homes in.

15:41.191 --> 15:42.943
Fiancé died on impact. Boom.

15:43.652 --> 15:45.070
Big, fat fucking fuck.

15:45.988 --> 15:48.323
Still got this wedding ring on.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.580
Sorry.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.248
That's fine.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.042
It's good. Please.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.299
It's not a baby.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.968
My…

16:09.887 --> 16:11.388
She was a librarian.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.724
Saw that on the news.

16:14.308 --> 16:17.436
Oh, well, I'm glad you said something
before I sat down then.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.813
Yeah, I guess I was dealing with
a few things of my own, aight?

16:25.986 --> 16:26.987
Right.

16:27.863 --> 16:28.989
Why did she do it?

16:29.698 --> 16:31.200
What, you saw it too?

16:31.283 --> 16:32.868
Did everybody see it?

16:33.785 --> 16:36.246
Why did you do it?

16:40.751 --> 16:43.253
I don't know.
I guess I lost my fucking mind.

16:44.546 --> 16:47.925
The father, Apollo Kagwa,
was rushed to intensive care

16:48.008 --> 16:51.136
after he was found
with extensive injuries.

16:51.220 --> 16:56.225
Police are looking for Emma Valentine,
who is still unaccounted for.

16:56.308 --> 16:58.352
Her blood located at the scene.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.980
We're with the building super,
Fabian Vasquez,

17:02.064 --> 17:03.982
who discovered the victims.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.543
-Where is she?
-Oh, God.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.628
-Where is she?
-She's not here.

18:07.129 --> 18:08.714
Tell me where she is. I know she's here.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.674
-Apollo, no, n--
-Where is she?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.176
Don't hurt anyone!

18:12.759 --> 18:14.595
-Tell me where she is.
-Don't hurt anyone.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.597
-Apollo, you don't wanna do it.
-Where are the others?

18:16.680 --> 18:18.974
-You don't wanna hurt anybody.
-Lead me to them now!

18:19.057 --> 18:21.602
-Open the door. Open it.
-Okay. All right.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.979
-Go. Go!
-Take it easy.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.941
-Where's Emma? Where is she?
-I don't know.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.652
-Just tell me where she is.
-I don't know.

18:31.445 --> 18:32.779
Where's Yurina?

18:32.863 --> 18:34.031
Apollo?

18:34.114 --> 18:36.408
-No! Don't shoot!
-Don't scream. Stop.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.036
Stop! I'll shoot.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.207
Fuck!

18:43.290 --> 18:44.374
Oh, my God.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.794
Apollo, we're so sorry.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.798
Everyone's so sorry. Everyone's so sorry!

18:52.341 --> 18:53.842
-Where is she?
-We don't know!

18:53.926 --> 18:56.678
-We don't.
-Please just let us go.

18:56.762 --> 18:58.055
Nothing makes sense.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.392
People don't just disappear.

19:02.476 --> 19:03.519
They do.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.354
She did.

19:07.940 --> 19:09.650
Apollo, we don't know anything.

19:09.733 --> 19:11.568
She was tired. She was acting strange.

19:11.652 --> 19:13.695
-No, don't tell me she was fucking tired.
-She kept saying that the baby--

19:13.779 --> 19:16.740
-She was tired? I'm tired too.
-No, don't hurt yourself, Apollo!

19:17.324 --> 19:19.326
-I'm tired too!
-It's okay.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.079
I just want my mom.

19:26.792 --> 19:27.709
Are you scared?

19:27.793 --> 19:30.462
Yes! Yes.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.884
Oh, no. Help me.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.432
Okay. All right.

19:46.645 --> 19:50.482
I'm so sorry, Apollo. I'm so sorry.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.695
This can't be my life.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.033
They all testified on my behalf.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.619
It's crazy, right?

20:05.831 --> 20:08.333
What if the librarians
had known where she was?

20:10.043 --> 20:11.128
I would've killed her,

20:12.462 --> 20:13.463
and myself.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.924
-And anybody else who got in my way--
-Okay, that's it.

20:16.008 --> 20:18.343
Thank you so much, everybody.
Good session.

20:19.136 --> 20:21.847
Good session, thank you.
Good to see you again, Tom.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.154
What now?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.406
Apollo.

22:54.583 --> 22:55.792
Hope you're hungry.

22:55.876 --> 22:59.004
-Thanks. I brought some wine too.
-Okay.

23:01.298 --> 23:02.883
We're so glad you're here.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.761
Hey, yo, Birdman of Alcatraz,
you see your mama yet?

23:06.803 --> 23:09.765
Well, I'm still surprised
you live in a basement.

23:09.848 --> 23:11.600
You know Patrice is afraid of…

23:14.019 --> 23:15.020
commitment.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.689
And then he met me.

23:26.949 --> 23:27.950
Thank you.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.117
It's just chicken.

23:30.911 --> 23:32.371
For going to the funeral.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.957
I mean, it just means so much when--

23:35.541 --> 23:37.042
Did you see your mama yet?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.755
-No, not yet.
-Apollo--

23:41.839 --> 23:44.341
Hey, but, look-- Listen.
I got something for you.

23:45.759 --> 23:46.802
Take a look at this.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.348
To Kill a Mockingbird?

23:53.350 --> 23:54.768
Shit.

23:55.853 --> 23:59.064
Where'd you-- Found an estate sale
at Rikers Island?

23:59.773 --> 24:03.193
Appraiser, he sent me a text.
It's the real deal.

24:03.777 --> 24:07.781
It's got the certificates and everything.
And check the title page.

24:13.745 --> 24:16.331
This is some life-changing shit
right here.

24:17.291 --> 24:18.500
Where'd you say you found this?

24:20.043 --> 24:21.044
Doesn't matter.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.173
I found it, and I want you to have it.

24:24.965 --> 24:25.799
I can't--

24:25.883 --> 24:30.429
I was gonna get a house for me, Emma,
Brian, but it's not happening.

24:30.512 --> 24:34.474
So, you can take it and keep the money.

24:34.558 --> 24:36.727
I don't need the money.
I don't really need anything.

24:36.810 --> 24:37.936
-I just--
-Hey.

24:38.896 --> 24:39.897
We'll take it.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.043
You know why we're friends?

25:06.340 --> 25:09.051
'Cause I'm a better bookseller than you.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.929
And I taught you everything you know.

25:14.389 --> 25:16.099
Hey, even you don't believe that.

25:18.936 --> 25:24.441
First time we met was at
Rich Chalfin's book buyers' drinks.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.695
I told you I just got back from Iraq.
Know what you said?

25:31.448 --> 25:32.658
-Book sale.
-Yeah.

25:33.992 --> 25:35.869
Philadelphia. Hurry up, get there.

25:36.745 --> 25:41.124
None of that "thank you
for your service" shit, you know?

25:41.208 --> 25:43.669
You didn't ask me
how many people did I kill.

25:43.752 --> 25:45.838
You didn't give a fuck.

25:48.173 --> 25:51.718
That's when I knew you're a dude
I can be normal with, you know?

25:51.802 --> 25:53.554
Not a vet.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.597
Just Patrice.

25:59.476 --> 26:00.477
So…

26:01.436 --> 26:03.981
I'm breaking protocol and talking with you

26:04.064 --> 26:05.482
as straight as I ever have.

26:07.734 --> 26:08.735
Okay.

26:12.781 --> 26:13.907
If you kill yourself tonight,

26:13.991 --> 26:16.952
I'm gonna soak that valuable
fuckin' book in the toilet.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.248
I'm gonna piss on it and worse.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.085
I will ruin that book.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.507
What are you talking about?

26:33.010 --> 26:34.344
I've seen that look before.

26:35.596 --> 26:38.098
-What look?
-The one staring at me right now.

26:38.182 --> 26:40.392
I have seen that look, and I know.

26:40.475 --> 26:41.643
All right, good night.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.062
I know!

26:47.482 --> 26:48.734
You're a book man, right?

26:50.194 --> 26:53.488
Well, tonight,
I'm gonna put that book online.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.824
And if you're not around,

26:57.701 --> 27:00.829
you will never know
how much somebody would pay for it.

27:04.917 --> 27:05.918
You'll never know.

27:14.301 --> 27:15.636
You motherfucker.

27:19.932 --> 27:22.518
My man. I'll call you
as soon as I hear about it.

27:24.353 --> 27:25.812
You be alive to pick up.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.564
I love you, man. Night.

27:42.746 --> 27:44.540
I'm so proud of you.

27:56.343 --> 27:57.511
Okay.

30:08.809 --> 30:09.810
Emma?

30:16.358 --> 30:18.735
-Hello?
-Mom.

30:21.613 --> 30:22.614
I'm making tea.

30:23.198 --> 30:24.449
In the middle of the night?

30:24.533 --> 30:25.534
It's 12:20.

30:28.495 --> 30:30.539
How was dinner with Dana and Patrice?

30:32.457 --> 30:33.500
Dana called you.

30:35.544 --> 30:39.339
I was surprised to hear you'd seen them
before me. Your mother.

30:40.924 --> 30:42.509
Are you guilting me right now?

30:42.593 --> 30:43.927
Do you feel guilty?

30:47.014 --> 30:48.015
You hungry?

30:48.807 --> 30:51.643
No, I ate with Patrice and Dana.

30:51.727 --> 30:53.187
You didn't eat it.

30:54.897 --> 30:57.065
What, did they tell you how many times
I used the restroom?

30:57.149 --> 30:57.983
Two.

31:03.155 --> 31:07.701
Thanks, Mom. For coming here.
It's good to see you.

31:08.285 --> 31:12.414
For cleaning and just everything.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.930
You probably want to get some sleep.

31:28.931 --> 31:30.015
I do too.

31:49.034 --> 31:52.829
Look how many nights
We hug up tight, tight, tight

31:53.497 --> 31:56.583
All we ever know is love and peace

32:00.712 --> 32:04.299
Tomorrow morning,
I want you to come to Port Washington.

32:04.383 --> 32:05.926
See Brian's grave.

32:07.803 --> 32:08.804
I'm not ready.

32:11.223 --> 32:12.558
I want to tell you a story.

32:12.641 --> 32:14.643
I don't wanna hear one of your stories.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.187
It's just always so sad.

32:19.606 --> 32:22.901
Arthur got shot,
and the Ugandan dictatorship.

32:22.985 --> 32:24.111
And you fled here.

32:24.194 --> 32:27.573
And immigrants make the US great.
They make it what it is.

32:27.656 --> 32:29.408
It's just all sad.

32:31.577 --> 32:33.579
I wanted to tell you a different story.

32:53.307 --> 32:54.516
Who are you, man?

32:56.185 --> 32:57.311
Not a husband.

32:59.855 --> 33:01.231
Not a dad.

33:04.568 --> 33:05.861
Who the fuck are you?

33:48.195 --> 33:50.948
We got photos in here,
so we can send that to forensics.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.199
Okay. I understand.

33:53.700 --> 33:55.369
Get everybody clear of this room, please.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.913
-Everyone, clear out.
-Did you get a shot of that?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.627
-It's a boy.
-A boy?

34:04.920 --> 34:08.130
-Should we name him Brian?
-Yeah.

34:09.091 --> 34:10.175
I'm sorry.

34:11.426 --> 34:14.179
I woke up
with the worst feeling you disappeared.

34:15.514 --> 34:17.306
I was just thinking about…

34:18.934 --> 34:20.310
thinking about when he was born.

34:22.396 --> 34:25.023
He was-- You know, when he first--
He's come out.

34:25.690 --> 34:26.817
A slow time.

34:29.027 --> 34:31.362
When you exist in two worlds at once.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.949
Reality and eternity.

34:35.701 --> 34:36.952
Here and there.

34:37.953 --> 34:39.121
How did I lose her?

34:44.376 --> 34:45.502
What happened?

35:08.275 --> 35:11.945
I told myself I was gonna read him
this book every single night.

35:15.199 --> 35:16.700
But I didn't.

35:18.702 --> 35:19.912
I didn't have time.

35:22.331 --> 35:23.457
You're coming with me.

35:24.166 --> 35:25.250
What did you just say?

35:27.044 --> 35:28.879
Those were my last words to Brian.

35:29.963 --> 35:31.340
Why would you say that to him?

35:33.133 --> 35:35.719
Right after he was born,
I started having the dreams again.

35:36.803 --> 35:37.971
Why didn't you tell me?

35:39.681 --> 35:41.642
It's just this nightmare, all right?

35:47.314 --> 35:49.066
I have something I have to tell you.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.234
What?

35:52.486 --> 35:54.112
Mom.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.450
Lubbick, Weiss and Blackwood.

35:59.076 --> 36:00.869
They had a very good dental plan.

36:07.584 --> 36:11.964
What could I do? I asked everyone I knew.

36:14.216 --> 36:16.009
Finally, I left you at home.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.056
I went to work.

36:22.307 --> 36:23.392
You were four.

36:26.895 --> 36:30.941
So, you left me at home on a Saturday.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.442
Many Saturdays.

36:34.236 --> 36:37.614
You were so good. It worked well.

36:39.241 --> 36:42.578
But then things changed.

36:45.706 --> 36:46.707
I'm coming for you!

36:52.629 --> 36:56.091
-It's okay.
-Daddy came to me.

36:56.175 --> 37:00.554
-It's just a dream.
-Why didn't he take me with him?

37:01.972 --> 37:03.599
You can go back to sleep, honey.

37:05.267 --> 37:08.187
Look how many nights
We hug up tight, tight, tight

37:09.897 --> 37:12.482
All we ever know is love and peace

37:13.442 --> 37:16.195
I asked you what day your daddy had come.

37:17.446 --> 37:20.449
"Cartoon day," is what you said.

37:23.493 --> 37:24.453
So, wait.

37:24.536 --> 37:29.458
What you're telling me is my dad
was actually at the apartment?

37:29.541 --> 37:30.542
Yes.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.422
And that wasn't-- Those weren't dream--

37:35.506 --> 37:37.174
Those were memories. They weren't dreams.

37:38.258 --> 37:39.259
Yes.

37:40.886 --> 37:41.803
So, what happened?

37:45.432 --> 37:51.605
I got back in time.
Found him there. Sent him away.

37:54.024 --> 37:54.942
Why?

37:56.735 --> 37:58.153
I had filed for divorce.

38:07.412 --> 38:09.915
Apollo.

38:22.344 --> 38:24.179
-I--
-Why did you want a divorce?

38:26.348 --> 38:27.850
He was a good man.

38:30.102 --> 38:32.229
A real romantic. Fun.

38:32.813 --> 38:36.859
But marriage is a day-to-day,
and a person like your dad,

38:37.442 --> 38:40.362
-not so good with slow and steady.
-What does that even mean?

38:40.904 --> 38:46.451
Is there food in the fridge?
Is the bed made? Are the bills paid?

38:47.494 --> 38:50.372
I had to put you in day care
at two months old,

38:50.455 --> 38:51.790
so I could go back to work.

38:52.541 --> 38:55.878
Do you know what it feels like
to hand over a two-month-old to strangers?

38:55.961 --> 38:58.755
Probably better
than leaving a four-year-old alone.

39:00.090 --> 39:02.092
I had to leave him to keep afloat.

39:04.553 --> 39:05.804
So, he didn't abandon us?

39:08.974 --> 39:09.975
Wow.

39:10.726 --> 39:12.686
So, I become a father,

39:12.769 --> 39:15.189
I'm doing all the things a father does
or what I think a father does.

39:15.272 --> 39:16.690
-I'm making shit up as I go.
-Apollo.

39:16.773 --> 39:18.984
Just making things up badly, by the way.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.570
-Apollo.
-And look how the fuck it turned out, Mom!

39:22.613 --> 39:26.700
All because of, fucking, some decision
you made over 30 years ago.

39:27.784 --> 39:30.787
I tried my best. That's all I could do.

39:31.705 --> 39:35.501
Mom, why couldn't you just let him
be a part of my life?

39:35.584 --> 39:36.543
I don't understand.

39:36.627 --> 39:39.046
He could have been babysitting me
those Saturdays.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.965
You guys didn't even have
to talk to each other.

39:42.049 --> 39:44.009
I mean, I had plenty of friends
who had families like that,

39:44.092 --> 39:46.929
-and I envied them every single day!
-I couldn't do that.

39:47.888 --> 39:49.264
I felt like a monster.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.517
Like something was wrong with me.

39:51.600 --> 39:52.893
How could you ever think that?

39:52.976 --> 39:55.145
Because my dad left me
and didn't say a word.

39:55.229 --> 39:58.190
What else was I supposed to think other
than that I was a disappointment,

39:58.273 --> 39:59.525
or something was wrong.

39:59.608 --> 40:02.736
And it's all based on the choice
that you made that was good for you!

40:05.697 --> 40:07.574
Here's the address to Nassau Knolls.

40:08.617 --> 40:10.285
You should go to Brian's grave.

40:50.325 --> 40:53.120
-Thank you, Father.
-Take care of yourself.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.459
Father Hagen?

41:01.336 --> 41:02.504
You can call me Jim.

41:05.716 --> 41:07.301
Did you have any trouble finding us?

41:07.926 --> 41:09.845
No, it was fine. I live around the corner.

41:10.804 --> 41:12.181
-Listen, I--
-Can we just--

41:18.353 --> 41:20.856
So, this is where I confess,

41:22.065 --> 41:23.150
I know who you are.

41:25.986 --> 41:29.489
Your wife, Emma,
came here to plan a baptism for your son.

41:30.866 --> 41:34.369
She seemed to be having troubles,
but I could never have guessed that--

41:35.120 --> 41:38.290
-I would have tried to have helped if--
-Listen, listen.

41:38.373 --> 41:40.792
It's not your fault. Okay?

41:41.460 --> 41:46.256
I just got this thing I need you to sign
for my parole.

41:51.345 --> 41:55.390
Yeah, I'll be happy to,
but why don't we do it after the meeting?

42:07.486 --> 42:09.780
I'd like to welcome all the newcomers.

42:11.698 --> 42:13.784
I'm happy you were able to find us. Yes.

42:14.409 --> 42:16.078
I found you on the message board.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.162
That's great.

42:17.246 --> 42:19.665
Have you become a member or a fan?

42:19.748 --> 42:20.999
I'm a fan.

42:21.083 --> 42:24.044
That's great, Julian. I'm a fan too.

42:24.670 --> 42:26.046
I'm Alice, by the way.

42:26.129 --> 42:27.589
I forgot to introduce myself.

42:27.673 --> 42:29.675
-And--
-Hi, Alice.

42:29.758 --> 42:34.930
And we're gonna go ah--
Sir? No phones during the meeting.

42:36.557 --> 42:39.643
Sorry, I just figured I'd become a fan
right now.

42:43.272 --> 42:44.356
There. Sorry.

42:45.732 --> 42:47.609
Okay, why don't we go around the room

42:47.693 --> 42:49.653
and introduce ourselves?

42:51.029 --> 42:53.323
You don't have to speak
if you don't want to,

42:53.407 --> 42:54.741
but we'd love to get to know you.

42:55.242 --> 42:57.744
If you're here,
then you're a survivor too.

42:57.828 --> 43:01.707
My father used to read me
stories at night.

43:03.959 --> 43:06.003
Thanks, Apollo.
But first, let's go around and--

43:06.086 --> 43:11.216
-"A baby is a dream made real."
-Okay.

43:11.300 --> 43:14.261
"But a dream is a fairy's favorite meal."

43:15.554 --> 43:17.806
"There at the window they watched
as it sleeped.

43:17.890 --> 43:19.099
A child's"--

43:20.976 --> 43:24.021
Why would he read you that?
That sounds frightening.

43:24.813 --> 43:26.523
I saw my daughter in the computer.

43:28.859 --> 43:29.735
I turned--

43:34.031 --> 43:36.366
I turned on my laptop and there she was.

43:37.910 --> 43:43.540
My baby girl. Just a picture of her,
out at the park with her grandparents.

43:47.419 --> 43:48.879
But who took the picture?

43:50.589 --> 43:53.967
I opened my Gmail account
and there was an ad and it said,

43:54.051 --> 43:58.013
"Jim, we think you deserve a vacation
in Costa Rica."

43:58.639 --> 44:02.726
And I wondered how is it that they know
that I liked to be called Jim.

44:03.435 --> 44:05.812
Because my given name is Francis.

44:16.532 --> 44:18.992
The photo is from an apartment window.

44:25.415 --> 44:27.626
Who would take a picture of my child
from up there?

44:33.298 --> 44:34.591
There were other pictures.

44:35.467 --> 44:37.553
Other places. Other days.

44:37.636 --> 44:39.221
There's texts and emails,

44:39.304 --> 44:44.184
but every time I tried to show one
to Gary, they were gone. Deleted.

44:48.105 --> 44:49.106
Who could do that?

44:51.775 --> 44:54.194
I had the sense to hit print
as soon as I saw this one.

44:55.571 --> 44:57.239
It's the only proof I got.

45:00.909 --> 45:03.620
But when I looked at it long enough,
I noticed something else.

45:07.499 --> 45:12.087
That girl in the photo.
That is not my daughter.

45:13.297 --> 45:14.798
That is not Monique.

45:16.550 --> 45:19.178
I told Gary all this,
and do you know what he said to me?

45:21.138 --> 45:22.931
He told me to go on medication.

45:25.684 --> 45:27.561
I knew I had to find my own help.

45:28.353 --> 45:29.938
I found it with the mothers.

45:30.647 --> 45:31.773
The Wise Ones.

45:33.483 --> 45:35.777
Cal told me how to get my daughter back.

45:36.486 --> 45:37.988
Cal told me what to do.

45:38.572 --> 45:40.657
I just don't know if I can do it.

45:40.741 --> 45:42.409
That woman's gonna kill her baby!

45:42.993 --> 45:44.411
She's going to kill her baby

45:44.494 --> 45:46.496
and if you don't do anything
to stop it right now,

45:46.580 --> 45:50.876
-you can't say you didn't know this time.
-It is not a baby!

45:50.959 --> 45:55.047
-It is not a baby! It's not a baby.
-Okay, calm down.

45:55.130 --> 45:57.174
-Apollo, wait.
-It's not a baby!

46:00.093 --> 46:01.428
No!

46:08.268 --> 46:09.311
Hey, wait!

46:09.394 --> 46:10.812
Shit.

46:17.110 --> 46:19.863
Hey! Don't make me chase you!

46:21.823 --> 46:23.033
It's not a baby.

46:24.826 --> 46:25.744
It's not a baby.

46:26.662 --> 46:29.998
It's not a baby!

46:32.042 --> 46:34.503
Man. You're fast.

46:36.964 --> 46:38.215
I'm out of shape.

46:39.716 --> 46:42.302
Hey, I'm William. William Wheeler.

46:44.805 --> 46:48.267
Patrice sent me. Patrice Green?

46:50.352 --> 46:51.353
Hey, I want to buy the book.

46:51.436 --> 46:52.980
Then buy the fucking book!

46:53.063 --> 46:55.941
Just buy the book. Why do you need me?

46:57.317 --> 47:01.238
Gosh, man. I mean, wow.

47:02.573 --> 47:03.574
Look, I'm sorry.

47:05.534 --> 47:07.327
You know, Patrice told me to come here.

47:09.496 --> 47:10.706
You should probably curse at him.

47:23.135 --> 47:24.136
But…

47:27.472 --> 47:29.266
I really would like that book.

47:36.231 --> 47:37.399
They called the police.

47:39.193 --> 47:40.611
It was a pretty bad scene in there.

47:41.486 --> 47:44.656
Are you okay? You seem pretty shaken up.

47:46.575 --> 47:47.659
Can I buy you dinner?

47:49.995 --> 47:50.996
No.

47:53.790 --> 47:55.292
But you can buy me a coffee.

48:07.554 --> 48:10.057
I spent a while on the phone
with Patrice this morning.

48:10.140 --> 48:11.475
He served in Iraq, you know.

48:12.059 --> 48:13.101
Yes.

48:14.436 --> 48:16.063
Of course I thanked him for his service.

48:16.563 --> 48:17.606
He loves that.

48:22.528 --> 48:23.820
This is a good doughnut.

48:25.948 --> 48:28.200
Look, I'll be totally honest with you.

48:30.202 --> 48:34.623
To Kill A Mockingbird, one of
two books I ever read for pleasure.

48:37.709 --> 48:40.546
Tell me, would you?
Tell me where you found the book.

48:41.672 --> 48:43.340
Tell me how it all came about.

48:46.885 --> 48:50.222
I found it in the seventh moldy box

48:50.305 --> 48:52.641
in the bottom of a basement in Riverdale.

48:55.477 --> 48:57.938
Imagine if you'd given up
after six boxes of crap.

48:58.021 --> 49:00.941
Well, why would I do that?
I mean, I have a child and--

49:01.024 --> 49:05.070
I have two daughters.
Believe me, I understand.

49:05.946 --> 49:07.281
Hey, can I show you a picture?

49:08.991 --> 49:10.450
That girl in the photo.

49:11.118 --> 49:13.620
-Oh, darn it.
-That is not my daughter.

49:13.704 --> 49:15.080
-What is that? Hey!
-It's nothing.

49:15.163 --> 49:16.373
That is not Monique.

49:21.587 --> 49:24.256
I told Gary all this,
and do you know what he said to me?

49:24.339 --> 49:26.216
Look, I don't know why I filmed that.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.843
He told me to go on medication.

49:27.926 --> 49:30.304
-I'm sorry, let me just delete it.
-No. Wait.

49:32.139 --> 49:35.267
I knew I had to find my own help
and I found it with the mothers.

49:35.767 --> 49:37.186
"The Mothers."

49:37.686 --> 49:38.937
The Wise Ones.

49:40.147 --> 49:42.357
Cal told me how to get my daughter back.

49:43.025 --> 49:44.568
Cal told me what to do.

49:45.319 --> 49:47.696
I just don't know if I can do it.

49:51.700 --> 49:55.621
Yeah, it's just a silly habit. I'm sorry.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.415
Really, I am.

50:02.669 --> 50:03.712
But who's Cal?

50:06.757 --> 50:08.342
I don't know.

50:09.927 --> 50:12.221
Then she said something
about the Wise Ones.

50:12.304 --> 50:13.514
Do you know what that name is?

50:14.598 --> 50:15.641
What that means?

50:15.724 --> 50:17.768
I've heard of that before.

50:22.397 --> 50:23.524
What?

50:23.607 --> 50:24.942
It's from some book.

50:25.817 --> 50:26.902
It says,

50:27.778 --> 50:33.033
"In the villages were invariably found one
or two 'Wise Ones.'"

50:33.742 --> 50:35.869
Who are they?
What does it-- Who does it say they are?

50:43.043 --> 50:44.169
"Wise ones."

50:48.799 --> 50:49.925
"Witches."

50:51.218 --> 50:53.929
They told me not to go,
but I didn't listen.

50:54.012 --> 50:55.597
Of course you didn't.

50:59.059 --> 51:02.437
When it falls off my wrist,
those three wishes will come true.

51:03.605 --> 51:05.482
Do not cut it.

51:07.860 --> 51:09.653
Yeah. Looks robust.

51:10.487 --> 51:15.367
But I am the god Apollo.

51:20.873 --> 51:24.376
One must be
so careful what one wishes for.

51:27.796 --> 51:32.009
Emma, with me,
all three of your wishes will come true.

51:37.681 --> 51:38.724
Witches.
