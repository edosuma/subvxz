WEBVTT

00:21.605 --> 00:23.524
Corruption at the state fair?

00:23.607 --> 00:25.275
It's supposed to be a puff piece.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.569
Yeah, look,
I know it's not what you sent me to do,

00:27.653 --> 00:31.281
but, you know,
I found something more, so I chased it.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.826
Isn't that what you pay me to do?
A journalist doing his job.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.370
-All due respect...
-Dad.

00:36.453 --> 00:38.372
...but isn't that what got you in trouble
in New York?

00:38.455 --> 00:40.499
Look,
can't I just take another crack at him?

00:40.582 --> 00:41.583
Who are you talking to?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.544
-I know you wanna be writing...
-It's my editor.

00:43.627 --> 00:44.837
...more serious pieces,

00:44.920 --> 00:47.673
but you're just seeing
what you wanna see on this one.

00:47.756 --> 00:52.594
-I'm sorry. We can't run it.
-All right. Fine. Thanks.

00:52.678 --> 00:56.390
Okay. So, Dad, when we went to the pond
to see if the birds had been there,

00:56.473 --> 00:57.683
it was full of dead fish.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.060
-And you'll never guess what else.
-What?

01:00.143 --> 01:04.397
Remember when I said, like,
I felt like someone was watching me?

01:04.480 --> 01:05.482
Yeah?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.485
Well, there was this guy at the pond--

01:08.569 --> 01:11.154
Wait, what guy?
What are you talking about?

01:11.238 --> 01:13.740
Dad, I think it was him.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.242
I think it was Richie.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.789
No. No, no.
This feels like a reach, Scout.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.960
Walk me through your evidence, all right?

01:25.043 --> 01:27.671
Not what you're feeling,
not what you think, but the facts.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.008
Okay. He was about the right age.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.261
Okay, so, blond hair? Blue eyes?

01:34.887 --> 01:36.889
Well,
I didn't get a good look at his face.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.808
Because he had a beard.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.811
Right. It's okay.

01:42.895 --> 01:45.898
I do the same thing. All the time.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.984
Your spidey senses go off,
and you can't let it go.

01:49.651 --> 01:51.820
You know, this fixation, right?

01:51.904 --> 01:55.866
This thing that you have with Richie?
That's called a bias.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.826
And it's clouding your work.

01:58.660 --> 01:59.661
No, it's not.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.288
No, it's okay. It's okay.

02:01.371 --> 02:05.042
We all have a bias, you know?
We just gotta check it as we go.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.044
That's why it's so important
you gotta stick to the evidence.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.589
'Cause that's what's gonna lead you
to the truth.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.550
-Okay?
-Okay.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.636
Let's go back to the start, all right?

02:15.719 --> 02:17.846
-And go with what we know.
-Okay.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.350
What were you doing at the pond?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.644
-Well, remember the dead birds?
-Yeah?

02:23.727 --> 02:26.104
Well, I talked to Birdman,
and he brought us there,

02:26.188 --> 02:29.149
and when we got there,
the pond was full of dead fish.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.694
Okay. So... connection?

02:33.445 --> 02:34.863
The water.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.033
Birdman said the birds
might have drank out of the pond.

02:38.116 --> 02:43.789
So whatever killed the fish,
oxygen depletion, invasive species...

02:43.872 --> 02:47.292
Might have killed the birds.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.545
And maybe that's why Walter is sick too.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.296
That's your story.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.634
-Poisoned pond.
-A poisoned pond, yes.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.886
You follow the facts.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.851
Yeah, follow the facts.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.908
It's clear that something
is changing in Erie Harbor.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.203
God, what time is it?

03:25.205 --> 03:28.625
This past year has been
the hottest and wettest on record.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.670
Storms have been getting worse
and more frequent.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.464
Just this past week,

03:34.548 --> 03:38.552
a whole flock of birds
mysteriously fell from the sky.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.555
And birds aren't
the only animals suffering.

03:43.015 --> 03:48.061
Yesterday, dozens of fish were found dead
in the pond at Pinewood Park.

03:48.979 --> 03:52.149
Many local birds use this pond
as their water source,

03:53.066 --> 03:57.154
which means it could be responsible
for all the recent animal deaths

03:57.237 --> 03:59.072
and possibly more to come.

03:59.156 --> 04:03.452
So why is The Magic Hour Chronicle
the only paper reporting on this?

04:03.994 --> 04:07.331
And why aren't our town leaders
doing anything about it?

04:07.915 --> 04:11.293
If we keep ignoring
what the environment is trying to tell us,

04:11.877 --> 04:14.630
the next species impacted could be us.

04:15.881 --> 04:19.384
If the adults around here
won't do anything about it, then I will.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.720
Oh, my God, Hilde. Shut up.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.056
This little girl
ain't afraid of anyone, is she?

05:07.391 --> 05:08.642
What did Hilde do now?

05:08.725 --> 05:12.229
She's taken the locals to task
for neglecting their environment.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.569
You know, you might want to
take a page out of her book,

05:18.652 --> 05:20.320
throw your weight around a little.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.701
-You could do some real good in this town.
-You know I want to.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.578
But I gotta be careful.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.791
These guys, Daddy,
they are set in their ways.

05:32.875 --> 05:33.876
Yeah.

05:33.959 --> 05:36.920
But I'll bring 'em around.
It just takes a little time.

05:41.592 --> 05:43.677
You wanna believe
the world is getting better.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.346
-But lately...
-Hey.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.849
Now, that's still our name on that door.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.436
Don't go giving up on the world just yet.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.316
All right.

05:58.734 --> 05:59.735
I love you.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.321
Love you.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.288
Come on, baby.
You gotta eat so you can grow.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.998
Is he getting worse?

06:15.459 --> 06:19.630
Well, hopefully, he didn't go anywhere
near that pond I've been looking into.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.511
-He'll be okay.
-Can I help?

06:25.594 --> 06:28.138
Sure. See this dropper?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.973
We gotta talk to Izzy.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.100
Yeah, we can't put it off any longer.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.185
I know.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.563
Look, I'm just proud of her
that she didn't drive drunk.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.650
-Yeah, 'cause she can't drive.
-No, you know what I mean.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.486
I'm proud of her that
she didn't get in a car with someone else.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.572
Well, she needs to know that
this is kind of a big deal, right?

06:45.656 --> 06:48.033
Okay, maybe that'll just make it worse.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.452
Maybe we should
just try and make it normal.

06:50.536 --> 06:53.163
Like, these things happen,
you just have to be careful.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.791
Then she's gonna think we're saying
it's okay for her to do it.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.211
No, we need to make sure she comes
straight home from school every day.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.879
No more sleepovers.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.005
Okay, maybe...

07:02.089 --> 07:04.341
Curfew. Strict curfew every weekend.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.426
-Matt...
-Yeah, she's 14, come on.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.511
Yes.

07:07.594 --> 07:12.516
But we both did things like this
when we were her age.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.560
We did, so...

07:14.643 --> 07:19.106
Look, I'm not condoning it in any way,
but I just think Izzy is lonely.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.149
She's desperate to connect.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.236
Maybe that's what we should be focused on.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.364
Yeah, you know what?
Breaking rules? Right? Defying authority?

07:27.447 --> 07:30.158
That is the kind of behavior
that gets you fired.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.368
Wait, what?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.954
You think we would still be here
in Erie Harbor right now,

07:34.037 --> 07:35.247
making our daughter miserable,

07:35.330 --> 07:38.750
if I had just learned
to quit making waves and do my damn job?

07:38.834 --> 07:40.419
Matt, what are you talking about?

07:41.128 --> 07:42.754
I don't know.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.966
-I don't know.
-Honey.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.135
Daddy, are you okay?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.930
-Yeah. I'm great, honey.
-Don't worry. He's fine.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.807
I'm great.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.894
Look. Whatever this is,

07:56.977 --> 08:00.022
it feels kind of unrelated.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.982
You know?

08:02.065 --> 08:05.819
So maybe we should just
start with some more structure

08:05.903 --> 08:07.779
and boundaries for her.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.948
-Okay, all right.
-Yeah.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.242
-Okay, she needs a little more...
-Maybe.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.827
-...little more connection.
-Yeah.

08:13.911 --> 08:16.705
Yeah, okay, so maybe
she should spend some more time with us.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.875
-Yeah, a little one-on-one time.
-Yeah.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.252
What are you thinking?

08:23.879 --> 08:26.715
What? I'm gonna be your glorified intern?

08:26.798 --> 08:29.801
Well, I can think of way worse punishments
than helping your mom out at work,

08:29.885 --> 08:30.886
believe me.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.056
-Okay, great, then give me those.
-Wow. Okay.

08:34.765 --> 08:35.765
Okay, look--

08:36.350 --> 08:38.309
I know I did something wrong,
and I'm sorry.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.938
But can you at least, like,
ground me for three weeks?

08:41.020 --> 08:42.648
That would be so much easier.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.108
We're not trying
to make this easier for you.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.528
We are trying to help you learn
to make smart choices.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.154
Yeah, and getting drunk,

08:49.238 --> 08:50.989
and then lying about it?

08:51.073 --> 08:52.115
Not a smart choice.

08:52.741 --> 08:53.742
I know.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.663
Look, there's a million reasons
why someone your age shouldn't drink.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.082
You know, it makes you do dumb stuff.

09:00.707 --> 09:04.336
Look, I said I'm sorry,
and I know it was dumb.

09:05.212 --> 09:06.213
Trust me.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.714
Look, sweetie, we...

09:10.217 --> 09:12.803
we're just worried about you.

09:12.886 --> 09:17.891
We're worried that these older kids
are influencing you more than you realize.

09:19.685 --> 09:22.437
-It could've gone so badly for you.
-Right.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.565
-You know, and we're excited, right?
-Yes.

09:24.648 --> 09:26.608
We're excited that you got new friends.
That's great.

09:26.692 --> 09:28.986
We just don't want you
getting in over your head.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.363
-Okay?
-Yeah.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.158
When do I start?

09:40.956 --> 09:42.916
-Lieutenant Miller?
-Out sick.

09:43.542 --> 09:46.211
Again? Well, where's Sanderson?

09:54.303 --> 09:56.805
Frank, I got a weird question.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.807
Oh, boy.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.812
-What's your dad up to these days?
-My dad? I don't know.

10:04.897 --> 10:06.982
What? It's not like we were best friends.

10:07.065 --> 10:10.319
It's just, I tried to call him
a couple times, but he doesn't answer,

10:10.402 --> 10:12.696
and I can't bring myself
to leave a message.

10:13.906 --> 10:17.075
I feel like I'm fighting his ghost
in here every day.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.828
I mean, he's not here,
but it's like the man never left.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.079
Do you know, it's still,

10:21.163 --> 10:23.957
"Briggs says this,"
and "Briggs wants that."

10:24.041 --> 10:27.628
Is there any way you could set up
a meeting with him so I can tell him off?

10:28.295 --> 10:33.133
Look, I am all for that,
but I haven't spoken to him in months.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.011
And I don't plan on starting.

10:36.094 --> 10:40.224
Frank, not after everything?
He's still your father.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.476
What?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.853
What you gonna do? Avoid the man forever?

10:45.729 --> 10:46.980
In a town this small?

10:47.064 --> 10:48.190
I'm gonna try.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.110
All right.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.167
Mom, Principal Collins is here to see you.

11:07.251 --> 11:09.086
Yeah, I can see that.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.088
Come on in.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.341
Sorry about that.
The new girl's a bit of a mess.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.344
Have a seat.

11:19.346 --> 11:23.267
So, I've been meaning to
bring this to you.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.936
-What?
-Got you a present.

11:26.812 --> 11:29.189
It's nothing big.
I mean, you can see that.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.567
Just a little something to say thank you.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.238
It's a hair dryer? Or...

11:36.822 --> 11:38.323
No, it's a bullhorn.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.618
You know, for everything you did
to get the PTA off my back.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.038
Did it work?
Have they stopped bothering you?

11:45.122 --> 11:46.582
For now. Yeah.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.586
A few dirty looks in the parking lot,
but nothing I can't handle.

11:50.669 --> 11:53.130
I think you officially shut them down.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.549
Thank you.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.051
I love it.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.351
Look, since I'm here...

12:08.437 --> 12:11.857
I'm gonna need you and Matt
to come by after school tomorrow

12:11.940 --> 12:14.735
for a meeting with Jessica's parents.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.695
It's my understanding

12:16.778 --> 12:19.907
that the girls were drinking
at Jessica Fife's house the other night,

12:19.990 --> 12:22.117
and I just want to bring you both in

12:22.201 --> 12:24.912
to discuss the events
that took place afterwards.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.082
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Of course we'll be there

13:01.615 --> 13:05.077
Not so easy, is it? Being the boss.

13:05.160 --> 13:08.121
It'd be easy if my deputies stopped
taking their orders from you.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.958
Nah, I don't recall coming
around the department lately.

13:11.041 --> 13:14.086
Wouldn't want Rutherford
to get his panties in a twist.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.381
Yeah, but you're still in touch
with all of my deputies,

13:17.464 --> 13:20.300
having your little usual meetings
down at the dry dock.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.513
I am trying to clean up your mess

13:24.596 --> 13:26.723
and make this department work
for the town.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.600
And you're still in my way.

13:28.684 --> 13:30.394
I'm not your problem, Trip.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.354
The Liskos are.

13:32.437 --> 13:35.732
You really gonna sit here and blame
a ten-year-old girl for all your problems?

13:35.816 --> 13:36.817
Still?

13:36.900 --> 13:40.195
You gonna sit here and blame
a unemployed old man for yours?

13:42.865 --> 13:47.035
It's not the Liskos exactly,
but they're a perfect example.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.413
You can't let those kids
treat the department

13:49.496 --> 13:51.623
like their own personal fun house.

13:52.332 --> 13:56.420
It kills morale,
and it makes you look soft.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.713
Soft?

13:57.796 --> 14:01.842
This town, there's the way things are done
and everything else.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.052
It's just gonna piss people off.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.473
There are all sorts of rules
you gotta play by.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.562
And one of those rules is
you're always on the side of the town.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.646
I am.

14:14.730 --> 14:18.483
When you let Hilde Lisko
and her gang of... whatever they are

14:18.567 --> 14:21.695
walk all over people,
you think it looks that way?

14:21.778 --> 14:25.699
It looks like you care more about
some hell-raising family from Brooklyn

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
than you do your own deputies.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.333
I'm trying to listen to everyone.

14:35.209 --> 14:39.004
People deserve that, even little kids.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.548
Now, if that makes me soft...

14:43.217 --> 14:46.261
then, okay. I guess I'm soft.

14:49.515 --> 14:50.891
For what it's worth, Trip...

14:52.017 --> 14:53.810
I'm not standing in your way.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.772
I know how hard the job is.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.442
Yeah, I should get going.

15:04.321 --> 15:05.322
Hey.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.243
Are you gonna tell Frank we talked?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.995
I don't think it'd matter much to him.

15:13.497 --> 15:14.498
Well...

15:15.499 --> 15:19.419
if you do,
maybe you could put in a good word.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.091
I know you think
the Liskos are the problem,

15:24.174 --> 15:29.555
but sometimes I've found,
in their own backwards way...

15:31.056 --> 15:33.267
they're usually a part of the solution.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.788
Hey, Spoon. What's with the coat?

15:56.248 --> 15:59.877
I get it. You gotta wear it in
before you commence the restyle.

16:00.460 --> 16:04.173
So, what's the plan?
How you gonna give it that Spoon sparkle?

16:04.756 --> 16:08.135
Zippers where the pockets should be?
Pockets where the zippers should be?

16:08.218 --> 16:10.804
Guys, Walter wasn't eating much
this morning.

16:10.888 --> 16:13.390
But I followed
all of Birdman's instructions.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.185
I'm worried about him.

16:16.268 --> 16:20.022
Well, if Walter drank from the same pond
as the other birds did, then...

16:20.105 --> 16:21.356
I've seen this movie before.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.442
Walter's patient zero,
and we're all gonna die.

16:23.525 --> 16:24.985
-What?
-If we can find out

16:25.068 --> 16:26.361
exactly what's in that water,

16:26.445 --> 16:29.573
then maybe we can get Walter
the right medicine to cure him.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.910
Whatever's in that water has killed
everything it's come in contact with.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.786
And that's why we're testing it.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.164
With the kit you got
at the hardware store?

16:37.247 --> 16:38.332
We need to be careful.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.417
If the water's killing animals,

16:40.501 --> 16:42.711
there's a good chance
that it's dangerous for humans.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.838
I think you need to calm down.

16:45.756 --> 16:47.007
I don't feel so good.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.302
But we're not even there yet.

16:50.761 --> 16:54.306
It might be airborne.
We won't know until it's too late.

17:23.001 --> 17:25.002
Come on, guys.
We have to get outta here.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.298
I don't understand. My numbers are great.
They're up from last month.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.050
I don't need your numbers to be up.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.677
We're under investigation right now

17:31.760 --> 17:34.721
for closing 35 cases
we never should have closed.

17:34.805 --> 17:38.225
-Okay, ma'am. I'll close fewer cases.
-No comment.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.269
I'm not here for you, Bob.

17:40.853 --> 17:43.146
Do you know who put up the fence
at Pinewood Park?

17:43.230 --> 17:46.358
The department's official stance when
dealing with members of the press is--

17:46.441 --> 17:47.985
We're not here as reporters.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.653
We're here as private citizens.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.738
Okay, I don't know about a fence, guys.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.282
Can you find out?

17:55.409 --> 17:59.997
Hilde, this is a sheriff station.
It's not your little clubhouse.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.165
-I know.
-Okay, well,

18:02.249 --> 18:05.210
we can't drop everything to go look
into a mysterious fence for you.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.882
But don't you care
that all the town's animals are dying?

18:11.508 --> 18:14.761
If you have a concern
we should be aware of,

18:14.845 --> 18:18.015
you can fill out this form,
like everyone else.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.893
Take care of this, would you?

18:23.228 --> 18:25.731
Hey, Bob. I got this.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.361
Sorry, things are a little tense
around here

18:31.445 --> 18:34.281
with... Rutherford and everything.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.326
But I'm here.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.914
And I got plenty of time.
So, what's on your mind?

18:41.997 --> 18:44.666
Well, they put a fence
around the pond at Pinewood Park.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.336
We need to test the water
to find out what's killing the fish,

18:47.419 --> 18:48.629
but now we can't get to it.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.382
Well, it's a public park,

18:52.466 --> 18:55.135
so the town probably put up the fence.

18:55.219 --> 18:57.429
Maybe they read your article
from this morning.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.767
Let me make some calls.

19:01.850 --> 19:04.144
If it was the town,
then there would be hearings

19:04.228 --> 19:06.522
and meetings
and environmental impact studies.

19:06.605 --> 19:09.775
That's a lot of red tape.
That'll give us time to test the water.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.026
Thanks, Frank.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.153
-Thank you.
-Anytime. Hey, Woodward.

19:14.655 --> 19:15.656
Keep your head up.

19:17.658 --> 19:20.077
-You.
-Me what?

19:20.160 --> 19:21.870
You could be my new source.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.709
Thanks.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.756
They are teenagers.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.800
They're gonna break the rules
now and again.

19:34.883 --> 19:38.262
But power came back on
just in time to capture this.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.810
-Is that Jessica?
-And Izzy.

19:45.686 --> 19:48.063
They must have snuck out
during the sleepover.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.065
They were egging the school.

19:50.941 --> 19:54.069
There was no real damage,
and it was just a prank,

19:54.152 --> 19:56.697
but it's clear from the video
that they were drunk.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.205
Do you think they know about the eggs?

20:05.998 --> 20:06.999
What eggs?

20:09.001 --> 20:15.507
Look, Izzy is a good kid,
but this really isn't normal for her.

20:15.591 --> 20:18.552
Listen, when I was a kid,
I did something just like this.

20:19.845 --> 20:23.307
And the threat of being punished,

20:23.390 --> 20:25.142
it made me sick for a week.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.895
It's actually why
I probably never did it again.

20:27.978 --> 20:30.898
Now, I want Jessica and Izzy
to have that chance.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.735
So I am only giving them detention,

20:34.818 --> 20:39.948
but if I see them in here again,
there will be more serious consequences.

20:43.785 --> 20:47.539
Jessica.
Did you tell them it was me that did it?

20:47.623 --> 20:49.791
Is that why you haven't been
answering my texts?

20:51.627 --> 20:54.463
Iz, my mom took my phone away.

20:58.175 --> 20:59.885
Okay, let's go.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.519
Look, I really am sorry.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.648
-Come on. We got work to do.
-Yeah, let's go.

21:26.954 --> 21:29.498
Dad.
You'll never guess who my new source...

21:30.332 --> 21:31.333
is.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.502
Hey, Hilde.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.087
It's been a long time.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.547
What are you doing here?

21:37.256 --> 21:40.342
Hey, you know what, Hilde,
we're just talking right now.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.552
Okay, Scout?

21:52.521 --> 21:56.483
I can deal with people ignoring me
and shutting me out, but...

21:57.734 --> 21:58.986
not my own son.

21:59.069 --> 22:01.655
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
how I can help you with that.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.491
Look, like I said, Frank won't talk to me.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.619
And I just need him to hear me out.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.538
So, I--

22:10.038 --> 22:11.665
Well, I wrote something.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.335
I thought I might send it to him

22:15.419 --> 22:19.965
instead of keep trying
to talk face-to-face.

22:21.133 --> 22:25.554
You know him well,
and you're a words person.

22:26.138 --> 22:27.139
So...

22:29.558 --> 22:31.476
Do you think I should change anything?

22:34.146 --> 22:36.940
Well, I think this is between the adults.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.442
Why?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.652
I'm a words person.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.905
Hey, you know what, that's true.

22:42.988 --> 22:45.490
She is a words person.

22:45.574 --> 22:46.742
All right.

22:46.825 --> 22:49.870
I guess I never did get very far
treating you like a kid.

22:53.790 --> 22:57.586
"I'm sorry
if my actions hurt your feelings."

23:01.507 --> 23:02.591
That's your apology?

23:03.383 --> 23:07.346
I mean, Dad, if I said anything like that,
you'd say it wasn't enough. You'd say,

23:07.429 --> 23:09.765
"Show me with your actions."

23:09.848 --> 23:12.226
-Right.
-Look, Frank can be stubborn,

23:12.309 --> 23:17.105
and it's hard for him to see
a different point of view sometimes.

23:17.189 --> 23:20.984
Right. Yeah, Frank... can be stubborn.

23:22.903 --> 23:26.073
Yeah, well, believe it or not,
he's different now.

23:26.740 --> 23:27.741
Really?

23:27.824 --> 23:30.244
Frank defends the little guy
and makes sure they get a chance.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.288
He sticks up for people
when they don't have anyone else.

23:33.372 --> 23:37.000
Yeah, despite everything,
he's been a good friend to this family.

23:37.709 --> 23:42.172
Even when...
didn't exactly make it easy for him.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.676
I didn't know all that.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.594
Frank deserves more than this.

23:48.887 --> 23:50.264
He deserves action.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.771
Well, what do you suggest I do?

23:57.855 --> 23:59.648
Maybe buy some billboards?

24:00.190 --> 24:01.483
'Cause if I start that,

24:01.567 --> 24:05.988
there's a lot of people
I'm gonna have to say I'm sorry to.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.282
So... it's a lot of billboards.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.951
Don't tell him you've changed.

24:11.994 --> 24:12.995
Show him.

24:24.756 --> 24:29.052
These are all from Wott.
Three more letters just this week.

24:30.679 --> 24:34.308
They're threatening legal action if
I don't respond to their offer by Monday.

24:34.892 --> 24:38.520
Matt was able to hunt down an address
for their headquarters,

24:38.604 --> 24:40.939
but when we went there,
it was just a front.

24:41.023 --> 24:42.900
Wait, so Wott doesn't exist?

24:43.859 --> 24:47.279
-Then who have I been dealing with?
-I don't know yet.

24:50.407 --> 24:51.825
-Cowards.
-I know.

24:51.909 --> 24:54.328
At least look a man in the eye
when you try to take what's his.

24:54.411 --> 24:55.871
Yeah.

25:00.542 --> 25:01.835
I'm willing to go to court,

25:01.919 --> 25:04.796
but I wanna know
what I'm really up against.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.842
Okay, until then,
I'm requesting injunctive relief for you.

25:09.510 --> 25:11.261
We're not just gonna roll over.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.639
We'll get a restraining order
against Wott.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.391
No, wait.

25:17.184 --> 25:20.979
You sign that,
it's like the first phase of a lawsuit.

25:22.231 --> 25:24.691
I just wanna make sure
this is what you really want.

25:25.609 --> 25:29.363
That offer, it's still a lot of money,
and this could blow it all to pieces.

25:29.446 --> 25:32.491
I don't care about the money.
They can take my last damn penny.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.661
I'm tired of getting kicked around.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.456
I want these companies to know
that there's consequences.

25:41.291 --> 25:43.210
I think that's really brave.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.129
Look out!

25:47.631 --> 25:48.841
What the...

25:52.344 --> 25:55.180
Hi, you've reached the Liskos.
Leave a message.

25:56.640 --> 25:57.850
Hilde, it's Donny.

25:57.933 --> 26:00.853
My dad says you can do homework
at my house tonight

26:00.936 --> 26:04.398
so we can do that science experiment
we talked about.

26:05.315 --> 26:06.817
So just hurry up and get here.

26:13.574 --> 26:14.867
Is everyone okay?

26:14.950 --> 26:17.119
Yeah, we're fine, considering...

26:17.786 --> 26:20.789
I don't care about the window.
I'm just glad everyone's okay.

26:20.873 --> 26:23.292
We'll file the injunction straightaway.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.711
-Thank you.
-Come on, honey. Let's go.

26:28.797 --> 26:31.049
-Okay, my girls. See you.
-See you later.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.301
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:32.384 --> 26:33.594
-See you, Iz.
-Bye.

26:38.640 --> 26:42.269
All right, what do we think?
We think this is Wott Management again?

26:42.352 --> 26:44.062
Did you even get a look at the guy?

26:44.146 --> 26:46.899
No, they drove away too quick
for me to see.

26:47.482 --> 26:51.236
I'm gonna add this to my daily patrols,
give your dad some extra protection.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.113
I appreciate you wanting to help,

26:53.197 --> 26:56.408
but right now
this is still a standard vandalism case.

26:57.075 --> 26:58.994
I'm sure Rutherford would love to report

26:59.077 --> 27:03.624
that I'm diverting extensive
police resources as a favor for my dad.

27:03.707 --> 27:07.002
I mean, she's right.
And the fact is this may not be Wott.

27:07.753 --> 27:11.298
It's been a while, but it's not the first
time I've had a brick through my window.

27:12.466 --> 27:13.884
Could've been some racist punks.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.763
That car you heard driving away
must've come from somewhere.

27:17.846 --> 27:20.807
Come on. It's just like we'd do
for any other case of vandalism.

27:20.891 --> 27:22.351
I'll check the perimeter.

27:23.519 --> 27:24.853
Thanks, Frank.

27:26.146 --> 27:27.898
Hey, Frank. I'll come with you.

27:31.401 --> 27:33.987
Hey, it'll be okay.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.661
You gonna run a story
about what happened out here?

27:40.744 --> 27:43.330
I had no idea
they'd received threats before.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.582
Well, I'd love to.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.794
Just not sure my editor would be receptive
to that right now.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.590
Look, you know your dad came to see me?

27:54.800 --> 27:56.760
-And Hilde.
-What'd he want?

27:58.971 --> 28:00.973
I know you're not
speaking to him right now.

28:01.056 --> 28:04.893
But, you know,
I think he wanted to apologize.

28:04.977 --> 28:07.062
Yeah, fix things between you two.

28:09.314 --> 28:12.943
Yeah, well,
there's a first time for everything.

28:13.026 --> 28:14.611
You know, it's not my business,

28:14.695 --> 28:17.489
but the thought of any
of my kids not speaking to me...

28:18.365 --> 28:21.243
Well, maybe the way to stop things,

28:21.326 --> 28:24.204
you know,
break the cycle of this damn town...

28:25.998 --> 28:28.458
is to show him some forgiveness.

28:29.001 --> 28:30.127
Yeah.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.713
Maybe he is trying this time.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.175
I'll believe it when I see it.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.804
Hey, that look familiar?

28:48.645 --> 28:51.440
So the guy was probably
casing Junior's joint,

28:51.523 --> 28:55.194
wanted to send a message and found
the first thing that could do some damage.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.946
Yeah, these people are bad news.

28:59.907 --> 29:01.575
I'll go brief Trip.

29:12.836 --> 29:14.046
In through here.

29:18.217 --> 29:20.886
I thought you said it would be easier
to sneak in at night.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.638
Well, I thought it was gonna be.

29:23.889 --> 29:25.349
What are they doing?

29:25.432 --> 29:27.518
I've never seen so many trucks
in one place.

29:29.394 --> 29:30.395
What was that?

29:32.189 --> 29:33.398
Oh, no.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.193
Get down.

29:39.738 --> 29:41.865
Come on, guys. Now's our chance.

29:41.949 --> 29:43.784
-Go, go, go.
-Come on. Let's go.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.743
Hilde, come on. Come on.

30:29.955 --> 30:31.790
Hey. Hey, what's going on?

30:33.876 --> 30:35.127
You okay?

30:35.210 --> 30:36.920
Hey, what is it? What's wrong?

30:38.505 --> 30:41.049
You were right. It's not Richie.

30:41.592 --> 30:42.801
What? Let me see.

30:46.054 --> 30:47.973
It doesn't look anything like him.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.106
I feel so stupid.

30:56.190 --> 30:59.818
Hey, no. Come on. Come on.
Don't say that.

31:00.819 --> 31:01.820
Don't say that.

31:02.321 --> 31:04.781
I just really thought it was him.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.325
Yeah, I know you did.

31:08.202 --> 31:09.286
You were right.

31:09.870 --> 31:12.456
I let my bias affect the story.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.003
I'm such a bad reporter.

31:18.086 --> 31:20.964
No. No, no, no. You are not.

31:21.882 --> 31:24.927
You are not, okay? You are absolutely not.

31:26.053 --> 31:28.263
You know, if anything, this was my fault.

31:29.348 --> 31:32.267
You know, I'm the one who's supposed
to be teaching you this job.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.896
Now instead, I'm just giving you
all of my bad habits.

31:37.147 --> 31:38.190
Come on.

31:38.690 --> 31:40.776
Hey. Hey, look at me.

31:40.859 --> 31:43.445
You know, I wanted to believe it too.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.739
You know,
that Richie was gonna come back.

31:47.199 --> 31:49.701
I wanted to believe it so bad.

31:50.911 --> 31:51.912
But you know...

31:53.288 --> 31:55.123
you're never gonna find the truth...

31:56.124 --> 31:58.460
if you're only looking
for what you wanna see.

31:59.545 --> 32:00.754
So remember that.

32:02.381 --> 32:03.382
Come on.

32:06.593 --> 32:09.513
So, I don't have a story then.

32:09.596 --> 32:11.515
No, that's not true.

32:12.391 --> 32:13.892
It's not. That is not true.

32:13.976 --> 32:19.147
You know, sometimes a story
is exactly what it looks like.

32:20.274 --> 32:23.360
Even if it is boring.
But that's the job.

32:24.027 --> 32:26.280
It's hard being a reporter.

32:27.072 --> 32:29.908
But if it were easy,
everyone would want to do it, right?

32:30.492 --> 32:31.493
Right.

32:38.667 --> 32:42.087
Now I just have to figure out
what they were doing at Pinewood Pond.

32:43.172 --> 32:44.381
Pinewood.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.300
I love that pond.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.805
Used to fish there all the time.

32:56.852 --> 33:00.230
What if Pop-Pop got sick
the same way Walter did?

33:00.314 --> 33:01.982
From fishing at the pond.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.486
I was just following the facts.

33:09.990 --> 33:14.203
All right, well, he does have
a doctor's appointment next week.

33:15.662 --> 33:16.997
You wanna come with?

33:35.098 --> 33:36.225
You got a minute?

33:44.775 --> 33:47.110
So they got you on the same beat, huh?

33:49.154 --> 33:50.239
Yep.

33:52.741 --> 33:56.036
You know, retirement doesn't suit me.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.123
Bored out of my damn mind.

34:00.207 --> 34:03.043
But I did try that home beer brewing kit

34:03.126 --> 34:06.505
that you and your sister bought me,
what, eight years ago.

34:07.422 --> 34:08.715
Tastes like vinegar.

34:11.342 --> 34:13.344
Should come by and try it sometime.

34:17.558 --> 34:19.685
Look, Frankie. I...

34:20.768 --> 34:23.772
I've tried to reach out to you before,
but I just--

34:24.523 --> 34:26.024
I never knew what to say.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.283
But I owe you an apology.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.159
I failed you...

34:37.703 --> 34:40.246
as your boss and as your father.

34:41.790 --> 34:42.791
And I'm sorry.

34:45.252 --> 34:46.253
It's...

34:49.297 --> 34:50.424
I appreciate that.

34:51.300 --> 34:54.178
I'm sure you had a lot
of impossible decisions to make,

34:54.261 --> 34:55.262
and you were just...

34:56.346 --> 34:57.848
doing your best.

34:57.931 --> 35:02.060
You know, I used to always tell myself
that's what made me good at my job,

35:02.144 --> 35:05.439
is that I could make the hard choices.

35:05.522 --> 35:08.108
I thought I was doing
what was best for you,

35:08.859 --> 35:11.236
for everybody around here.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.363
But I was just scared to be wrong,

35:13.864 --> 35:16.742
scared of facing all the pain
that I might have caused.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.202
You were wrong, Dad.

35:18.702 --> 35:21.079
There are still a lot of people hurting
because of you.

35:21.163 --> 35:22.164
I know.

35:23.498 --> 35:24.499
I know.

35:25.209 --> 35:28.128
And I wanna try to make things right.

35:28.212 --> 35:29.421
If that's really true...

35:31.924 --> 35:34.092
then the one you should be talking to...

35:35.469 --> 35:36.678
is Sam.

35:42.017 --> 35:43.018
Yeah.

35:44.645 --> 35:45.854
That's what I thought.

35:46.772 --> 35:47.773
Frank.

36:03.664 --> 36:04.790
Hey, I got your text.

36:08.377 --> 36:10.379
Glad your mom gave you your phone back.

36:12.673 --> 36:13.674
Are you okay?

36:23.141 --> 36:25.102
My parents are pulling me out of school.

36:25.185 --> 36:26.228
What?

36:26.311 --> 36:28.188
Yeah, they're sending me
to boarding school.

36:30.107 --> 36:32.860
God, what, because you,
like, egged a couple windows?

36:33.610 --> 36:35.445
No, it's not because I did it.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.824
It's 'cause I don't remember doing it.

36:40.409 --> 36:43.537
And that's why I didn't say anything
at the principal's office

36:43.620 --> 36:45.038
when you mentioned the eggs.

36:46.456 --> 36:48.709
'Cause I didn't know
what you were talking about.

36:49.334 --> 36:50.919
Wait. Wait, what?

36:52.004 --> 36:53.213
I blacked out.

36:56.842 --> 36:59.178
And I've been in trouble
for drinking before.

37:00.053 --> 37:02.890
My mom is really serious about it
'cause of my granddad.

37:02.973 --> 37:06.185
Because technically he passed away
'cause his liver wouldn't work anymore,

37:06.268 --> 37:07.436
so...

37:08.270 --> 37:09.271
Are you okay?

37:11.148 --> 37:12.149
Yeah.

37:15.694 --> 37:17.696
They warned me
about doing something like this.

37:17.779 --> 37:20.240
I just never thought
they were serious, you know?

37:20.324 --> 37:21.325
Yeah.

37:22.284 --> 37:24.661
Maybe this could be good for me.
You know?

37:24.745 --> 37:26.163
Yeah, I know you can do it.

37:31.585 --> 37:33.462
I wish we were like this sooner.

37:35.297 --> 37:37.966
God, why were you so mean to me before?

37:38.675 --> 37:41.178
I don't know. High school, I guess?

37:46.892 --> 37:49.603
You were just now becoming
my only friend here too.

37:49.686 --> 37:51.396
God, what am I supposed to do now?

37:51.480 --> 37:52.481
Oh, come on.

37:53.398 --> 37:55.859
If I were you, I would've fully ran away,
like, ages ago.

37:58.111 --> 38:00.489
You're too cool
for a place like Erie Harbor, Iz.

38:01.823 --> 38:03.158
And I mean that.

38:07.579 --> 38:09.498
I'm really gonna miss you.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.083
I'm gonna miss you too.

38:21.385 --> 38:22.386
Goodbyes are gross.

39:11.143 --> 39:13.937
I thought you said
you were gonna stay out of my way.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.400
I did. And I will.

39:19.985 --> 39:22.613
But last night
I ran into some of the deputies.

39:23.322 --> 39:25.407
Wow, another meeting at the dry dock?

39:30.037 --> 39:32.539
They were getting drunk and bragging...

39:33.749 --> 39:35.250
about sending a message...

39:38.462 --> 39:39.671
with a brick.

39:44.092 --> 39:48.639
I thought that was Wott Management
trying to intimidate my dad.

39:54.311 --> 39:55.395
Message?

39:57.731 --> 39:58.732
To you.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.405
Look...

40:07.241 --> 40:09.201
those guys might be loyal to me...

40:10.577 --> 40:14.957
but I'm not loyal to them
and their cowardly behavior.

40:19.419 --> 40:20.838
These are their names.

40:23.757 --> 40:24.967
Take 'em down...

40:26.885 --> 40:27.970
Sheriff.

40:52.494 --> 40:55.163
Well, there haven't been
any major setbacks,

40:55.247 --> 40:57.916
but no improvements either.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.546
Right. All right, well, he has been having
some moments of lucidity lately.

41:03.046 --> 41:05.924
Look, I know we've done all of the tests,

41:06.008 --> 41:09.678
but is there any chance
he may have been exposed

41:09.761 --> 41:12.514
to something, anything in his environment?

41:12.598 --> 41:14.474
Maybe while he was fishing?

41:14.558 --> 41:17.978
Well, Alzheimer's is
an incredibly difficult diagnosis.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.564
But what if you're wrong?

41:21.106 --> 41:22.107
Hilde...

41:22.774 --> 41:23.984
Wrong about what?

41:24.693 --> 41:28.155
What if he's sick with something else?
Something treatable.

41:28.238 --> 41:32.117
His cognitive decline
is consistent with Alzheimer's.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.077
But what if that's not the whole story?

41:34.953 --> 41:37.873
If I could figure out
what's in the water that made him sick,

41:37.956 --> 41:39.917
would you be able to make him feel better?

41:41.001 --> 41:44.463
Well, I can't say for sure.
There's a lot of factors.

41:44.546 --> 41:45.923
But there's hope.

41:46.632 --> 41:48.258
We can always try.

41:48.759 --> 41:49.760
Thank you.

41:51.553 --> 41:53.972
-I'll go get Pop-Pop.
-Okay.

41:54.598 --> 41:55.807
Well, hello, you.

41:57.142 --> 41:59.019
-Come here.
-Are we ready?

41:59.102 --> 42:00.562
Should I have said no?

42:00.646 --> 42:03.941
Honestly, I don't think she would have
believed you even if you had.

42:04.733 --> 42:05.734
Yeah.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.447
This is nice.

42:53.448 --> 42:54.658
-You wanna dance?
-Yeah.

42:54.741 --> 42:55.742
Yeah.

42:56.743 --> 42:57.995
-Hey.
-Very good.

42:58.704 --> 43:00.789
-One more.
-Hey, careful, guys. Careful.

43:04.251 --> 43:05.669
-Hey, Hilde.
-Yeah?

43:06.253 --> 43:08.130
I just got a text from Frank.

43:09.548 --> 43:10.549
It's for you.

43:16.346 --> 43:18.765
-Sorry, Dad. Gotta go.
-Wait, what?

43:20.017 --> 43:22.144
"Meet me at the place
you were asking about"?

43:22.227 --> 43:23.604
What does that even mean?

43:24.938 --> 43:25.939
Hey, Hilde!

43:43.665 --> 43:44.750
What's going on?

43:57.221 --> 44:01.058
It gives us great pride
to show you our plans

44:01.141 --> 44:04.895
for Erie Harbor's newest community garden.

44:04.978 --> 44:08.190
Unfortunately, the pond here was overrun

44:08.273 --> 44:11.860
with an invasive strain
of toxic blue-green algae.

44:11.944 --> 44:13.695
So it was toxic algae.

44:13.779 --> 44:17.741
But thanks to the rapid response
of our corporate sponsor,

44:17.824 --> 44:22.371
we got it all cleaned up as quickly
and safely as possible. Yes.

44:25.541 --> 44:27.292
They didn't just clean the pond.

44:28.335 --> 44:31.630
-They made it disappear.
-It's like it was never even there.

44:31.713 --> 44:33.549
We'll never be able to test the water now.

44:33.632 --> 44:36.009
Because of
The Magic Hour Chronicle's reporting,

44:36.093 --> 44:38.971
our team caught the algae bloom early,

44:39.054 --> 44:42.015
before it could spread
and harm any more animals.

44:43.392 --> 44:47.312
All of this beauty will soon be here
because of you.

45:09.835 --> 45:11.170
Hey, you.

45:11.253 --> 45:13.422
Hey, what happened?

45:14.339 --> 45:15.340
It's gone.

45:16.383 --> 45:17.384
What's gone?

45:18.177 --> 45:20.220
The town got rid of the pond.

45:20.304 --> 45:23.348
They said it was toxic algae,
so they made it into a garden.

45:23.974 --> 45:25.225
That's great, right?

45:25.726 --> 45:27.895
That's great.
Now you got an end to your story.

45:27.978 --> 45:30.230
No. You don't understand.

45:30.314 --> 45:34.818
Now I'll never be able
to find out what's wrong with Pop-Pop.

45:35.235 --> 45:36.236
Look, Hilde.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.948
Pop-Pop's been sick
for a really long time.

45:40.032 --> 45:43.285
You know, algae doesn't even cause
the kind of symptoms that he has.

45:43.368 --> 45:46.914
I know I need to be careful
about seeing what I wanna see,

45:46.997 --> 45:49.416
but what if it wasn't just algae?

45:49.499 --> 45:53.295
What if there was something else
in the pond that made him sick,

45:53.378 --> 45:54.963
and that's why they covered it up?

45:55.047 --> 45:57.174
Well, you said it was algae.

45:57.925 --> 46:00.385
-No, they did.
-Who's they?

46:00.469 --> 46:02.513
I don't know. The town.

46:02.596 --> 46:06.558
But why didn't they hold any hearings
or do any of that normal stuff?

46:06.642 --> 46:09.228
Why did they just make it disappear?

46:09.811 --> 46:12.564
You know what,
it feels like you're reaching again.

46:12.648 --> 46:15.984
There has to be something out there
that can make him feel better.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.110
Yeah, there is.

46:18.237 --> 46:21.156
There is. It's you, silly.

46:21.657 --> 46:23.825
-You're like a magic potion to Pop-Pop.
-No. No.

46:23.909 --> 46:26.036
-Yeah, he's crazy about you.
-No, Dad. Dad, no.

46:26.119 --> 46:29.164
Don't do that to me. You know I hate it.

46:32.459 --> 46:33.752
All right, listen, look,

46:33.836 --> 46:37.506
even if we did find out that Pop-Pop
was exposed to something in the water...

46:38.131 --> 46:41.552
you know, we can't change
or reverse what happened to him.

46:42.427 --> 46:45.013
You know, it doesn't work like that.

46:46.682 --> 46:47.808
I don't care.

47:06.785 --> 47:08.620
I have to try.
