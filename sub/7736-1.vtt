<i>[Frank sighs]
[Susan] Daddy's home! Time for dinner.</i>

00:24.967 --> 00:28.555
- I made pigs in blankets.
- Oh, my favorite. Thanks, honey.

00:28.638 --> 00:30.473
Dad, do you know anything about magnets?

00:30.557 --> 00:32.308
A buddy from the war
has one in his head.

00:32.392 --> 00:34.644
We used to throw paper clips
at it. Does that help you?

00:34.728 --> 00:37.355
Daddy, I got an "A" on my spelling test!

00:37.439 --> 00:39.941
Oh, that's wonderful, princess.

00:40.024 --> 00:44.237
Well, I guess His Royal Highness
has finally decided to join us.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.197
Yeah, I'm high, all right.

00:46.281 --> 00:49.200
All right, guys, dig in.
Oh, so I gotta tell ya,

00:49.284 --> 00:51.494
the funniest thing
happened at work today.

00:51.578 --> 00:54.226
Ed calls a mandatory
meeting, we go to the break

00:54.227 --> 00:56.875
room, and he's just
bragging about his new tie.

00:56.958 --> 00:59.210
[chuckles] So then I says to Ed...
[phone ringing]

01:01.797 --> 01:04.006
Jesus Christ. I'm not answering that.

01:05.300 --> 01:08.052
Frank, you should answer it.
What if somebody got hurt?

01:08.136 --> 01:10.221
Nobody ever gets hurt
at supper, Susan, OK?

01:10.305 --> 01:13.308
It's always some goddamn
salesman, and I'm not answering it.

01:13.391 --> 01:15.184
Dad, we all know you're gonna answer it.

01:15.268 --> 01:16.937
You don't know a goddamn thing about me.

01:16.938 --> 01:18.631
[ringing continues]

01:18.772 --> 01:20.022
What if it's important?

01:20.106 --> 01:22.776
I sweated blood at that
airport for 12 hours today,

01:22.859 --> 01:26.070
and what's important to me
is I have just one moment

01:26.071 --> 01:29.282
of peace with my family, enjoying
a delicious home-cooked meal.

01:29.365 --> 01:31.827
Is that too much to ask?
I'm not answering it.

I don't need a goddamn
engraved family Bible!

02:00.355 --> 02:02.148
You see? You see?
What did I say?

02:02.231 --> 02:05.234
Every goddamn time. I am eating
dinner with my family, young man!

02:05.318 --> 02:08.154
<i>I don't need a $25 Bible

02:08.237 --> 02:11.533

I have met God!

02:12.701 --> 02:14.327
What did you just say to me?

02:14.410 --> 02:16.705
Ah, you come down here and
you say that to me like a man!

02:16.788 --> 02:19.207
<i>I swear I'll pull your tongue
out through your goddamn neck!</i>

02:19.290 --> 02:22.460

02:23.085 --> 02:25.129
Why do they have to put the
goddamn things on the wall?

02:25.213 --> 02:27.965
- Frank, calm down.
- Yeah, "Frank, calm down, calm down."

02:27.966 --> 02:29.759
It's always "Frank, calm down!"

02:29.843 --> 02:33.388
Why's it always me, Susan?
How about a little support? Huh?

02:33.471 --> 02:35.673

02:40.395 --> 02:42.689
So, how was school?

02:42.772 --> 02:45.738
Goddamn punk, calling me at supper.
Huh? Huh?

02:45.773 --> 02:47.318
Won't even come to my door like a man?!

02:47.402 --> 02:50.655
<i>Hi, Mr. Murphy.

See? You see that?
That right there, that is a man.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.886

04:36.970 --> 04:39.097
- Nothing.
- That's enough, Kevin.

04:41.537 --> 04:43.893

That's my guy, Irish Mickey.

05:11.337 --> 05:13.662
Ya know, he would've beat
Shavers the last time, but

05:13.663 --> 05:15.987
lost on a technicality
'cause the ref thought he was

05:15.988 --> 05:18.803
bleeding too much, which he wasn't.
He lost because he was drunk.

05:18.887 --> 05:21.430
Hey, Sue, I gotta have
everybody over to watch this.

05:21.514 --> 05:22.612
Some food, some beer.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.809
I'll throw one of my
"Frank's Famous Fight Parties"

05:24.893 --> 05:27.187
- for the whole neighborhood.
- That's a great idea.

05:27.269 --> 05:29.480
I know. You better start
cooking, good looking.

05:29.564 --> 05:32.984
- Can I watch the fight too?
- No. This is gonna be a grown-up party,

05:33.068 --> 05:34.861
so you kids are gonna
have to stay in your rooms.

05:34.944 --> 05:36.696
Close the door and lock 'em.

Oh, this is gonna be fun, Sue.
I mean, this is gonna be big.

05:39.824 --> 05:42.347
You can put my chair right
in the middle of the room,

05:42.348 --> 05:44.871
right in front of the TV.
Get some that good bottled beer.

05:44.954 --> 05:47.207
And make that "Frank's Special
Chip Dip." [plop in toilet]

You know, with cream
cheese and chili in a can?

05:49.167 --> 05:52.087
[dryer whirring]
[yelling] And those fancy potato chips

05:52.170 --> 05:57.592

We can use it as a garbage can after!

05:57.675 --> 05:59.468

05:59.552 --> 06:00.970
<i>[panting] Those... those deviled eggs?</i>

06:00.971 --> 06:02.388

<i>[Susan] Yeah. Are you
gonna stuff the eggs?</i>

Have fun! Come home when
the streetlights come on!

06:16.276 --> 06:18.696
Don't go playing with those dirty
kids down the end of the block.

06:18.780 --> 06:21.074

- [kids] We won't!

06:22.742 --> 06:23.826
What do you want to do?

06:23.910 --> 06:26.370

rusty lawn mower in the woods.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.123

06:28.206 --> 06:29.832
[Maureen] How much will you give me?

06:31.500 --> 06:34.294
Hey, you stay away from that
loose girl down on River Street.

06:34.378 --> 06:36.172
I don't want any half-slut grandkids.

06:36.256 --> 06:38.507
- We're not doing anything.
- Neither was I.

06:38.591 --> 06:42.095
- That's how you got here!
- That's a fine boy you got there, Frank.

06:42.678 --> 06:44.472
Ah, he's a fuckin' animal.

06:45.305 --> 06:49.447
Street sign: yes.
Magnetic attraction

Actually, too many to mention.

[slobbering sounds]

06:53.982 --> 06:55.275
What the hell are you doing?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.194
Tastes like Momma's gun.

06:59.028 --> 07:01.423
Give it back, Kenny!
[Kenny growls]

07:02.157 --> 07:05.534
- Oh, you'll never get it now.
- Bite down hard, Ken!

07:09.122 --> 07:10.623
[magnet clangs]

07:12.041 --> 07:15.753
Oh, man, that's the Nazi's house.
He's gonna kill me!

07:15.837 --> 07:17.797
Who's a Nazi, Ben?

07:17.880 --> 07:21.334
You know, that German
guy in that there house.

07:21.369 --> 07:24.553
Kids all say he's
Hitler's little brother.

07:24.637 --> 07:26.806
Yeah, yeah, and he hunts down kids.

07:26.889 --> 07:28.850
Shut up, he's gonna hear you!

07:29.934 --> 07:30.893
[all gasp]

07:30.977 --> 07:33.395
[door creaking]

07:35.815 --> 07:39.027
[German accent] Well, hello.
Do you need some help?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.862
[voice wavering] No, I'm OK.

07:40.945 --> 07:45.116
- Oh, please, it is my pleasure.
- It's OK, I got it.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.369
- He almost got you!
- You see that number on his arm?

07:48.370 --> 07:51.039
That's how many people he's killed.
It's a scoreboard!

07:51.122 --> 07:53.749
Have a wonderful day, children!

07:56.169 --> 07:58.296
Oh, it is gonna be one
hell of a fight party.

07:58.379 --> 08:01.299
Sue is going all out. She's
making those deviled eggs you like.

08:01.382 --> 08:03.801
She's got the Rice Krispies with
the toothpick things in there.

08:03.885 --> 08:06.470
All right? We got plenty of booze. 
Everyone's coming.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.015
- Everybody's getting loaded.
- I can bring a Jell-O loaf!

08:09.098 --> 08:11.309
Jell-O?
Babe, this is a fight,

08:11.392 --> 08:13.561
not a party for someone
with stomach cancer.

08:13.644 --> 08:16.689
Yeah, the thing is, actually, it's...
 [chuckles]

08:16.772 --> 08:18.607
it's a little delicate, but uh...

08:18.691 --> 08:21.819
we've already been invited to
watch the fight over at, uh...

08:22.570 --> 08:25.732
- at Vic's.
- Vic's?

08:25.767 --> 08:27.616
Wait, we always
watch the fight at my house.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.098
I am the fight host on
this block! And why the hell

08:30.099 --> 08:32.496
would you want to hang out
with that guy anyways? Huh?

08:32.580 --> 08:35.332
What, do you like his hair, and
his car, acting all Hollywood?

08:35.416 --> 08:37.710
You can't see through
that phony positivity?

08:37.793 --> 08:41.214
"Hey, guys! You need some help?
Oh, have a great day!"

08:41.297 --> 08:44.300
Fucking asshole. Last time, I'm
walking with my wife, my woman,

08:44.384 --> 08:48.054
he's got the nerve to go,
"Hey, Frank, you're a lucky man."

08:48.137 --> 08:51.015
"Lucky man"? Luck had
nothing to do with it, punk!

08:51.099 --> 08:53.142
Hey, Frank, take it easy, take it easy.

08:53.226 --> 08:55.603
Nothing against you, we
just kind of like him.

08:55.686 --> 08:58.022
- For one thing, he smells great.
- He's got you there, Frank.

08:58.106 --> 09:00.357
[car approaching]

09:01.067 --> 09:03.361
Ah, Christ. Here he comes.

09:16.465 --> 09:18.342
<i>Hola, amigos!</i>

09:18.426 --> 09:21.262
- Just the men I want to see.
- [woman] Mm...

09:21.345 --> 09:24.682
Would you look at that jerk, carrying
on like he's a goddamn astronaut.

09:24.765 --> 09:28.394
- Probably has the clap.
- Kitty Kat, make me some mac and chee.

09:28.395 --> 09:30.062
Not the spiral kind,
that makes me dizzy.

09:30.145 --> 09:32.147
[slap]
[giggles]

09:32.940 --> 09:34.692
Hey, so how about that fight?

09:34.775 --> 09:37.528
Big Skillet's gonna kill
that pasty booze-bag.

09:37.612 --> 09:40.322
Hey, where's your loyalty?
 You're white.

09:40.406 --> 09:43.367
So what? Black dudes are cool.

09:43.451 --> 09:45.661
You ever seen one naked? 
I do all the time.

09:45.745 --> 09:48.789
- Big stars, too.
- Oh, yeah? Which ones?

09:48.872 --> 09:51.270
One of the Four Tops was
washing his armpits in

09:51.271 --> 09:53.669
the men's room at the radio
station just last week.

09:53.753 --> 09:56.756
He was the main one, I think. 
We made eye contact.

09:56.838 --> 10:00.578
Good guy.
Hey, Frank, it'd be righteous

10:00.613 --> 10:02.386
if you joined us to
watch the fight at my house.

10:02.470 --> 10:05.723
- Thirty-two inches of living color.
- Thirty-two inches?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.933
- That's pretty big.
- Up here, Babe.

10:08.016 --> 10:10.352
Well, thanks, but you're a little late.

10:10.436 --> 10:12.980
Everyone in the neighborhood
is already coming over

10:12.981 --> 10:16.164
to watch the fight on my new
color set. It's 33 inches.

10:16.191 --> 10:17.818
<i>[Vic] They make 'em that size?</i>

10:17.901 --> 10:20.780
- They do for me.
- Out of sight.

10:20.862 --> 10:24.283
You got it all going on. I bet
you're digging the skin you're in.

10:24.366 --> 10:28.746
- You bet your ass I am.
- Hey, Vic! It's hot.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.290
About to get hotter. See ya, fellas!
[Kitty Kat giggles]

10:31.373 --> 10:34.075
Eh, Frank, I look through
your window every night.

10:34.076 --> 10:35.877
And I've never seen a color TV.

10:35.961 --> 10:39.590
- It's great that you got one!
- Yeah. I was gonna surprise you.

10:39.674 --> 10:42.760
Well, it's gonna be one hell of a party.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.970
[shouts] Frank got
himself a new color TV!

10:45.053 --> 10:49.677
- It's 33 inches!
- [German man] Oh, that's wunderbar!

10:49.809 --> 10:50.851
Oh, shit.

10:56.816 --> 10:59.450
That was bitchin'!
[groans]

11:00.027 --> 11:01.278
<i>[all] Ew...</i>

11:01.362 --> 11:04.490
- My turn!
- Hold your balls!

11:05.949 --> 11:09.620

11:27.512 --> 11:30.682
Hiya, Jimmy. 
Sorry about your house.

11:30.766 --> 11:34.227
It's not my house, shit stain.
It's my clubhouse.

11:34.311 --> 11:36.438
And I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

11:36.521 --> 11:37.856
[barrel clangs]
Huh?

11:38.649 --> 11:42.820
Little pussy! Get back here,
Murphy, and let me fuckin' kill you!

11:44.571 --> 11:48.366
Frank, why did you do that?
We can't afford a big color TV.

11:48.450 --> 11:50.869
Well, I can't afford
not to have one now.

11:50.953 --> 11:53.789
Things were said in that
driveway that cannot be unsaid.

11:53.872 --> 11:56.165
This is all the money we
have saved in the world.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.015
- It's Kevin's college fund.
- Come on, Sue.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.462
We both know
Kevin's not going to college.

12:00.545 --> 12:03.964
That's not the point.
I just wish you'd told me.

12:04.303 --> 12:07.848
All I'm saying is you don't get to
make big financial decisions

12:07.931 --> 12:10.684
- like this by yourself.
- Then agree with me.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.144
That way we both decided together.

12:12.227 --> 12:16.606
OK. All I ask is that we
stay within our budget.

12:16.690 --> 12:19.026
Absolutely. We will not
spend one more dime than...

12:46.303 --> 12:49.723
It is the biggest and heaviest
television on the market.

12:51.183 --> 12:54.311
Mm, this varnish. It's so decadent.

12:54.393 --> 12:58.523
- It was hand-rubbed in Korea.
- Huh. [gasps]

12:58.690 --> 13:00.817
- Wow.
- [softly] We don't have that much cash.

13:00.901 --> 13:04.779
- We're $50 short.
- I know, but I need this, Sue.

13:04.863 --> 13:06.948
Oh, I need this.

13:07.032 --> 13:09.910
You know, I'll tell you what.
We could finance that last $50

13:09.993 --> 13:13.398
at a point above prime: 26 percent.

13:13.538 --> 13:14.539

- No.

13:20.254 --> 13:22.130
- I won't tell anybody.
- No.

13:22.214 --> 13:23.965
- Then let me touch you.
- No.

13:24.049 --> 13:26.968
Come on, you're so
pretty and you're so cool,

13:27.052 --> 13:31.430
and I really like you, and you're
the only one I want to touch it.

13:31.514 --> 13:34.851
- All right, but only over your pants.
- Oh, thank you so much.

13:34.935 --> 13:39.064

killed by some big kids!

13:39.147 --> 13:41.913

- [Kevin] Jimmy!

13:58.583 --> 14:00.737

14:03.255 --> 14:04.505
Oh, hey, Kevin.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.050

work hard and go the extra

14:37.435 --> 14:39.666

the nice things in life.

14:39.749 --> 14:42.293
You are not to touch
this unless I say so,

14:42.377 --> 14:45.450
and I am never gonna say so. 
Is that understood?

14:45.485 --> 14:45.672
- OK.
- Yes.

14:45.755 --> 14:47.173
Good. Now go to bed.

14:49.676 --> 14:50.635
Are you ready?

14:51.886 --> 14:54.180

22:01.189 --> 22:03.609
and you are gonna march
right up to that salesman

22:03.692 --> 22:05.444
and apologize for what you did,

22:05.527 --> 22:09.030
and for making your
father humiliate himself.

22:09.114 --> 22:11.784
There were so many people
we knew in that store.

22:11.867 --> 22:14.578
Oh, Sue, for the love of Christ!

22:19.458 --> 22:23.420
So I kicked the guy's ass, jumped
into my car, and I got to the

22:23.421 --> 22:27.382
Civic right as Grand Funk was
taking the stage. It was insane.

22:27.466 --> 22:29.967
Just another page out
of my life journey.

22:30.051 --> 22:33.346
Did a bum shit in your mouth?
[door opens, closes]

22:37.058 --> 22:39.519
- Can I help you?
- Um, my dad told me to...

22:41.354 --> 22:42.755
I know who your old man is.

22:42.756 --> 22:44.858
That's the guy who poured
water in the Sonabishi.

22:44.942 --> 22:46.485
He didn't pour water in it.

22:46.568 --> 22:50.322
He sent you here to give me the sob
story? Too chicken to face me, huh?

22:50.405 --> 22:52.198
He's not chicken. I just...

22:52.282 --> 22:55.243
Nice old man you got there, sending
a kid to bitch and moan for him.

22:55.327 --> 22:57.496
Unbelievable. Now get outta here.

22:57.579 --> 23:00.081
Go tell your dad he's a
bigger punk than I thought.

23:00.165 --> 23:03.794
Or just stand there pissing
yourself, makes no difference to me.

23:04.753 --> 23:06.692
Did I tell you how
the Army didn't take me

23:06.693 --> 23:08.632
because they said my dick was too big?

23:08.715 --> 23:10.592
I mean, I can't help it.
I can't help what I got.

23:10.676 --> 23:14.095
Not complaining about it, but really
wanted to fight for our country.

23:14.179 --> 23:17.683
<i>[man on TV] Hey, Luger!
You're one dead gringo.</i>

23:17.766 --> 23:20.101
<i>Oh, is that so, Escobar?</i>

23:20.185 --> 23:25.231
<i>Sí. Are you going to run, or do you
got the cajones to stand and fight?</i>

23:25.315 --> 23:27.233
<i>Well, sometimes a man's gotta do...</i>

23:27.317 --> 23:28.902
<i>- what a man does.
- What a man does.</i>

23:28.986 --> 23:30.821
[distorted static]

23:32.113 --> 23:35.158
<i>[gunfire]
Ay, Chihuahua!</i>

23:37.786 --> 23:38.954
[audio sizzling]

23:45.627 --> 23:48.380
[static hissing]

23:50.966 --> 23:54.643
- I ain't buying this piece of shit.
- What the fuck is this?

23:55.303 --> 23:59.182
Jesus, Chuck, what in the hell
is wrong with all these TVs?

23:59.265 --> 24:02.477
[stammers] I don't know, Dad. We
never had a problem with these before.

24:02.561 --> 24:06.523
Well, we sure as shit do now!
I mean, Christ, they're all defective!

24:06.606 --> 24:09.442
Pull the receipts of
everyone we sold these to.

24:09.526 --> 24:12.612
Uh, excuse me, sir.
My dad bought one of those.

24:13.947 --> 24:16.073
The Pattonhouse is a better model.

24:16.157 --> 24:19.494
The Sonabishi is good, but we
must've got a bad bunch from overseas.

24:19.578 --> 24:22.414
Those Orientals don't do good
work. Their hands are too small.

24:22.497 --> 24:25.500
Again, my apologies for
the defective product.

24:25.584 --> 24:30.589
- And...
- Sorry I raised my voice to you, sir.

24:30.672 --> 24:33.675
Uh... OK. Thank you.

24:38.013 --> 24:40.473
- What happened in there?
- Well...

24:40.557 --> 24:44.212
I know what happened.
 I know exactly what happened.

24:44.728 --> 24:46.730
I finally won one! I won!

24:46.813 --> 24:50.149
<i>[yelling] You hear that, world?
Frank Murphy's not a loser!</i>

24:50.233 --> 24:51.860
<i>Frank Murphy's a wi...
[horn blaring]</i>

24:51.944 --> 24:54.227
<i>[Frank] Whoa! Watch it!</i>

24:54.446 --> 24:56.949
Ha-ha!
Those Koreans'll never kill me!

24:57.282 --> 24:59.284
<i>[male announcer] And the
fighters are approaching the ring!</i>

24:59.366 --> 25:01.953
<i>You can cut the excitement with
a knife! [indistinct chatter]</i>

25:02.037 --> 25:03.872
Hey, here we go, here we go!

25:03.955 --> 25:05.874
<i>[announcer] Shavers and Ireland
meet in the center of the ring</i>

25:05.957 --> 25:07.042
<i>for the traditional greeting.</i>

25:07.125 --> 25:09.878
<i>[man] There's something kind
of red there on Mickey's face.</i>

25:09.961 --> 25:11.796
Oh, my God, is he bleeding already?

25:11.880 --> 25:15.050
<i>I'll tell you, Ernie, he was
wearing a turtleneck earlier.</i>

25:15.133 --> 25:17.384
<i>Those are tough to get
off at this altitude.</i>

25:17.468 --> 25:20.555
Hey, your hero Vic is over
there watching it alone.

25:22.515 --> 25:24.600
[scoffs] Some party.

25:25.552 --> 25:27.720
<i>[announcer] We don't hold out many
hopes for the challenger tonight,</i>

25:27.803 --> 25:31.307
<i>- but he keeps on coming.
- Yeah, poor guy.</i>

25:32.058 --> 25:34.643
- Hey, where do you think you're going?
- Uh...

25:34.727 --> 25:37.105
- Finish my science project.
- No, you're not.

25:37.188 --> 25:39.357
Come over here and watch the
fight with the rest of the men.

25:39.441 --> 25:42.026
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

25:43.319 --> 25:45.238
<i>[bell clangs]
[Frank] OK, here we go! Here we go!</i>

25:45.321 --> 25:47.574
[excited chatter]

25:48.699 --> 25:51.750
One sip. Don't tell your mother.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.080
[announcer chatters indistinctly]

25:54.163 --> 25:56.291
Oh, no, they gotta stop this.

25:56.374 --> 25:59.043
<i>[Frank] That's it, Mickey, that's it,
let him punch himself out!</i>

25:59.127 --> 26:00.669
<i>[announcer] And there
goes the mouthpiece!</i>

26:00.753 --> 26:03.798
<i>Oh, it's gonna be a long and
painful night for the Irishman!</i>

26:03.881 --> 26:06.468
[crickets chirring]

26:06.593 --> 26:09.804
<i>[phone ringing]
[Frank] Ah, shit.</i>

26:11.638 --> 26:15.101
- Does it ever fail?
- Just answer it.

26:15.184 --> 26:17.895
Goddamn it. This better be good.

26:19.730 --> 26:21.149
He's dead?

26:21.816 --> 26:25.987
[stammers] OK. Yeah, of course.
Of course, yeah.

26:26.070 --> 26:28.739
- Who died?
- My boss, Ed.

26:28.823 --> 26:32.452
- There was an accident at the airport.
- Oh, my God, are you serious?

26:32.535 --> 26:35.330
They want me to come in early
tomorrow to cover his shift.

26:35.413 --> 26:38.833
Sue, I think I just got
promoted to management.

26:38.916 --> 26:40.168
I think you did, too.

26:40.251 --> 26:43.004
You know what? I think our
luck is finally turning around.

26:43.087 --> 26:44.922
Jesus, Frank, a man is dead.

26:45.006 --> 26:47.925
- Yeah, but he was kind of a dick.
- Frank!

26:48.009 --> 26:50.761
You know, if this had happened a
week ago, we could've got a bigger TV.

26:50.845 --> 26:53.348
- Frank!
<i>- [Kevin] Guys, I'm trying to sleep!</i>

26:53.431 --> 26:56.091
<i>[Frank shouts] Then close
your eyes and shut the fuck up!</i>

26:56.126 --> 26:57.435
