<i>In our obsession
with antagonisms of the moment,</i>

01:01.460 --> 01:07.698
<i>we often forget how much unites
all the members of humanity.</i>

01:07.700 --> 01:11.767
<i>Perhaps, we need some
outside universal threat</i>

01:11.769 --> 01:15.873
<i>to make us recognize
this common bond.</i>

01:15.875 --> 01:22.880
<i>I occasionally think how quickly our
differences worldwide would vanish</i>

01:22.882 --> 01:28.421
<i>if we were facing an alien
threat from outside this world.</i>

01:29.721 --> 01:31.722
<i>And yet I ask you,</i>

01:31.724 --> 01:36.826

01:36.828 --> 01:40.597

01:40.599 --> 01:45.368

01:56.314 --> 01:59.883
Oi, Matt, what's going on?

01:59.885 --> 02:01.785
Shit.

02:01.787 --> 02:03.954
Good day, Arnold.
How are we?

02:03.956 --> 02:07.823
Uh, take a wild guess.
How long?

02:07.825 --> 02:10.626
Well, like I tell you every day,
when I know, you'll know.

02:10.627 --> 02:13.930
- Got any smokes?
- No, mate, I don't. This is ridiculous.

02:13.932 --> 02:16.266
- You know, I've lived here for 50...
- Fifty-five years.

02:16.268 --> 02:20.436
Don't be a... take that bloody
tone of voice with me, boy.

02:20.438 --> 02:24.541
Fifty-five years, and I'll be damned if
I see the point of this bypass, really.

02:24.543 --> 02:26.442
It's progress,
Arnold, progress.

02:26.444 --> 02:28.679
Oh, progress my ass.
I've got fruit in the back

02:28.681 --> 02:32.281
that's about to go bad. I've been sitting
here for 42 bloody minutes, mate.

02:32.283 --> 02:34.483
- It's 2:45.
- All right. Look, I'll...

02:34.485 --> 02:35.953
I'll talk
to my supervisor, okay?

02:35.955 --> 02:38.922
- Yeah, you do that.
- Jesus Christ.

02:38.924 --> 02:41.424
Jimmy, can you take over, mate?
Gotta head off.

02:41.426 --> 02:45.362
Well... Well, Arnold's
giving away free fruit.

02:45.364 --> 02:46.929
Yeah, right, aye.

02:46.931 --> 02:49.298
Hey, does Boss know you're
knocking off?

02:49.300 --> 02:51.000
Only if you tell him.

02:51.002 --> 02:54.239
Tonight. Don't be late.

02:58.343 --> 03:01.845
Good day, Arnold.
Uh, mangoes.

03:01.847 --> 03:04.248
- Mangoes?
- Yeah.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.416
They're out of season,
you idiot.

03:06.418 --> 03:09.485
Who put you in charge? No wonder this
bypass is taking so bloody long.

03:09.487 --> 03:12.288
Now, listen,
I've lived here for 55 years.

03:12.290 --> 03:14.458
- Yeah, it, it... what it is...
- Get away from me.

03:14.460 --> 03:15.792
They build a road and it...

03:15.794 --> 03:17.463
Get back to work,
you mongrel bastard!

03:20.832 --> 03:22.733
What are you
doing off work?

03:22.735 --> 03:24.500
Well, unlike last week,
your sister wanted me

03:24.502 --> 03:25.869
to make sure you
get there on time.

03:25.871 --> 03:28.437
- Last week wasn't my fault.
- Mm-hmm.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.806
Besides, you ever tried
saying no to Amelia?

03:30.808 --> 03:32.976
I'm her brother.
Of course I've said no.

03:32.978 --> 03:35.679
You, on the other hand,
are screwed.

03:37.483 --> 03:39.416
I wasn't gonna say anything,
mate, because she's your sister,

03:39.418 --> 03:41.417
but she does this thing with her
legs, they go, like, right...

03:41.419 --> 03:44.353
Oh, that...
bad mental pictures.

03:44.355 --> 03:47.457
That's what you get, kid.

03:47.459 --> 03:49.326
Pass me the aspirin,
will you?

03:49.328 --> 03:53.030
You playing tonight?
Serious?

03:53.032 --> 03:56.066
Apparently. Pass one.

03:56.068 --> 03:57.633
Come on, come on.

03:57.635 --> 04:01.738
Yeah. Finally get
to see the big man work.

04:01.740 --> 04:02.805
Relax, will you?

04:11.582 --> 04:13.883
- Yo.
- What?

04:13.885 --> 04:17.353
- We've stopped.
- Why?

04:17.355 --> 04:21.324
- To stretch our legs.
- No thanks.

04:21.326 --> 04:22.928
I'm good.

04:32.403 --> 04:36.707
- Fine, Peter.
- Thanks, Bella.

04:36.709 --> 04:39.642
Come on, Samuel.

04:39.644 --> 04:42.712
Give me that. A bit
of real world won't kill you.

04:42.714 --> 04:46.585
Let it go.

04:48.786 --> 04:50.620
- Two bucks, mate?
- Do you know where we are?

04:50.622 --> 04:52.856
- Yes.
- Bella.

04:52.858 --> 04:56.760
- What's with this stupid town?
- I don't know, darling.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.663
We'll have a look around
and we'll find out, okay?

04:59.665 --> 05:01.697
Fine.
I'll meet you back here.

05:01.699 --> 05:04.101
Careful, Bella.
Dinner, back here 6:00.

05:04.103 --> 05:06.069
- Yeah.
- And I don't want any dramas.

05:06.071 --> 05:10.673
Mom, it's a country town.
What's gonna happen?

05:10.675 --> 05:12.878
Thanks, mate.

05:16.115 --> 05:18.016
Let it go.

05:31.797 --> 05:34.865
Hey, guys, it's me.
Thought I'd do a vlog,

05:34.867 --> 05:37.700
considering we've landed
in a parallel universe.

05:37.702 --> 05:40.937
I think this town
still thinks it's 1996.

05:40.939 --> 05:46.409
Probably all use landlines
and all have the same cousin.

05:46.411 --> 05:49.512
That's... that's mean.

05:49.514 --> 05:52.084
- Anyway.
- Do you want me to film for you?

05:53.485 --> 05:55.851
- No, thanks.
- I could do your sketch.

05:55.853 --> 05:59.555
- I do sketches.
- This all seems legit and not at all creepy.

05:59.557 --> 06:02.591
Well, you can't blame a guy for
trying to make an honest living.

06:02.593 --> 06:07.764
- You here on holidays?
- Uh, something like that.

06:07.766 --> 06:11.834
Just passing through, seeing what the locals
do on a Friday night in the middle of nowhere.

06:11.836 --> 06:17.072
- Well, this is it.
- Yeah.

06:17.074 --> 06:20.709
Wow, these are really good.

06:20.711 --> 06:23.647
It's okay.

06:23.649 --> 06:26.949
- Dennis.
- Shit. Yeah, I'm going.

06:26.951 --> 06:29.719
I doubt you've got
a permit for a stall. Come on.

06:29.721 --> 06:33.656
- We were just talking, officer.
- Yeah, well, Dennis knows the rules.

06:33.658 --> 06:38.060
I said I'm going.

06:38.062 --> 06:40.529
- It was nice talking to you.
- Yeah.

06:40.531 --> 06:43.966
Come on, move it.
Keep walking, Dennis.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.502
Uh-uh, hands off the car, go on.

06:46.504 --> 06:48.841
Fifth time this week.

06:55.848 --> 06:59.949
Beef burger, pineapple on the side, and chicken
Caesar salad, no mayo, extra croutons.

06:59.951 --> 07:01.485
Would you like another Coke?

07:01.487 --> 07:04.253
Oh, my feet are killing me.

07:04.255 --> 07:06.188
Um, Bill wants
another milkshake, okay?

07:06.190 --> 07:08.925
One chicken schnitzel
off a heart attack, that one.

07:08.927 --> 07:13.829
"The law presumes anyone entering into a
contract has the legal capacity to do so."

07:13.831 --> 07:17.033
- Hey, Amelia.
- Contract legal capacity to do so. Hey, Marcus.

07:17.035 --> 07:19.836
How was school? Contract law in
business and commercial life.

07:19.838 --> 07:22.738
- Hello.
- Mm, looks good.

07:22.740 --> 07:24.974
- Shut up.
- It's a bit chill for a cafe, isn't it?

07:24.976 --> 07:28.945
- How's the world of the law going?
- Ask me in two years.

07:28.947 --> 07:30.981
Here he is. Traitor,
working for the enemy.

07:30.983 --> 07:35.819
- Job's a job, Mom.
- Hey, Helen, I'm playing tonight.

07:35.821 --> 07:37.887
- Did you know that?
- You sure that's a good idea?

07:37.889 --> 07:39.856
- You're not as young as you used to be.
- Yeah, baby, you...

07:39.858 --> 07:40.990
You sure that's a good idea?

07:40.992 --> 07:42.125
Look, it's one of the last games

07:42.127 --> 07:43.226
of this season, maybe ever.

07:43.228 --> 07:44.627
I promise I'll be careful.

07:44.629 --> 07:46.829
Okay.
Then I'll come watch you.

07:46.831 --> 07:50.800
- Hey, your funeral.
- Thanks, Helen.

07:50.802 --> 07:53.039
Thanks for your support.

07:54.939 --> 07:58.207
Hey, last time he played,
he ended up in a coma, fact.

07:58.209 --> 07:59.242
I'm just saying.

08:09.588 --> 08:12.255
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

08:12.257 --> 08:14.658
- Oh! No, put me down.
- You missed me, did you?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.325
Put me down, honey.
You know I did.

08:16.327 --> 08:18.094
- So what's the big emergency?
- Um...

08:18.096 --> 08:20.596
Hey, Jack-o,
good luck tonight, mate.

08:20.598 --> 08:23.166
Oh, thanks, mate. We're
gonna absolutely kill them.

08:23.168 --> 08:26.603
Sorry, I didn't... you know
I can't say no to my fans.

08:26.605 --> 08:29.105
Well, I'm your biggest fan.

08:29.107 --> 08:31.974
- Okay, listen.
- I'm listening.

08:31.976 --> 08:35.981
- I just... I'm pregnant.
- I'm all ears, babe.

08:37.282 --> 08:40.753
- You... you're what?
- I'm pregnant.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.320
You sure?

08:43.322 --> 08:46.091
Yes, Jackson,
I'm pretty sure.

08:48.826 --> 08:50.326
- That's... that's amazing.
- Oh!

08:50.328 --> 08:52.329
Oh, wait, wait,
I didn't hurt the baby?

08:52.331 --> 08:55.600
Hey, I'm sure it's fine.

08:56.835 --> 08:59.736
Hey, how you doing in there?

08:59.738 --> 09:02.204
Okay, babe, it can't hear you.
It's, like, the size of a peanut.

09:02.206 --> 09:04.608
- Hey, yeah, but what a peanut.
- Oh.

09:04.610 --> 09:09.145
- What's all this then?
- Uh, we are, uh, starting our own team.

09:09.147 --> 09:11.381
- Oh, hey! Congratulations!
- Thank you, man.

09:11.383 --> 09:14.820
Thank you, Jimmy. Ah!

09:18.756 --> 09:20.757
What... what
the hell was that?

09:20.759 --> 09:23.627
Don't know, but, we, um,
better get going, yeah?

09:23.629 --> 09:25.929
Yeah, I'll see you guys out there.
I just have to change.

09:25.931 --> 09:29.833
- Yeah.
- Bye, baby. Babies.

09:29.835 --> 09:33.673
- Congratulations again, Ness.
- Thanks, Jimmy, good luck.

09:41.312 --> 09:44.647
- Thank you. See ya.
- See ya.

09:44.649 --> 09:46.382
Hello.

09:46.384 --> 09:48.685
Uh, apples?

09:48.687 --> 09:52.287
I wanna reassure you that
a vote for me and my party

09:52.289 --> 09:54.958
will be the best thing
that can happen to this town.

09:54.960 --> 09:57.893
We've got policies in place
and initiatives worked out

09:57.895 --> 10:03.233
to encourage industry back into the
community, which will create more jobs.

10:17.416 --> 10:20.749
Jesus.

10:20.751 --> 10:22.654
Simmons.

10:31.129 --> 10:32.462
Sorry.

10:36.701 --> 10:38.868
Oh, there you are.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.438
Thanks for coming tonight.
People love you

10:41.440 --> 10:44.040
and they need all the
enjoyment they can get, right?

10:44.042 --> 10:48.277
First the factory closes,
and then this damn bypass.

10:48.279 --> 10:52.181
Uh, we all hope you aren't out there
helping in the construction too much.

10:52.183 --> 10:54.084
- Uh...
- Right? Are you?

10:54.086 --> 10:56.486
Uh, how's the, uh, the head?

10:56.488 --> 10:59.155
You gonna be
all right tonight?

10:59.157 --> 11:01.824
Don't, uh, don't
kill yourself out there.

11:01.826 --> 11:05.361
- I won't.
- You, you know... you know what I meant.

11:05.363 --> 11:08.430
And good evening,

11:08.432 --> 11:11.834
ladies and gentlemen,
girls and boys,

11:11.836 --> 11:15.271
you're with Seth Grimes
from 97.1,

11:15.273 --> 11:18.208
the Country Smile on your dial.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.276
Catch me 7:00 to 11:00 weekdays.

11:20.278 --> 11:23.146
Now it's a perfect evening
for our own Drop Bears

11:23.148 --> 11:26.749
to take on the Kookaburras
in this match for charity.

11:26.751 --> 11:28.951
Oh, wait, hold the phone,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:28.953 --> 11:32.155
We have a, uh, special player
out on the field tonight.

11:32.157 --> 11:35.492
A blast from the past,
the big man himself,

11:35.494 --> 11:38.994
put your hands together for the
ex-captain, Matty Simmons.

11:38.996 --> 11:42.165
Go, Matty! Whoo!

11:42.167 --> 11:46.201
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

11:48.440 --> 11:51.377
Go, Matty!

11:53.979 --> 11:58.281
Hey, big man. I think
you, uh, forgot your helmet.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.949
That's funny.

12:00.951 --> 12:03.953
Look, mate, there's a talent
scout up here from Melbourne,

12:03.955 --> 12:06.292
so just stay out of my way,
all right?

12:14.499 --> 12:19.134
Dickhead.

12:19.136 --> 12:21.805
Okay, bring it in, lads!
Bring it in.

12:21.807 --> 12:26.276
I don't know why, why we
let her run off on her own.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.978
Because it's Bella.

12:28.980 --> 12:32.848
What, do you think we're gonna find her under
the grandstand making out with the town hunk?

12:32.850 --> 12:36.386
- No.
- Mom, look.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.921
Anyway, maybe I'll have
a look around for her.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.388
I'll meet you guys
back at the van.

12:39.390 --> 12:41.793
Okay. Bye.

12:42.994 --> 12:44.359
And there's the bounce.

12:44.361 --> 12:49.267
Simmons takes it in hand.

12:51.135 --> 12:53.502
Big kick there
from Jimmy Stiles.

13:00.278 --> 13:02.281
Get up! Get up, baby!

13:05.049 --> 13:10.386
Flying above the
pack there, Jackson! Amazing.

13:10.388 --> 13:15.992
And makes no mistake putting it
through the sticks.

13:15.994 --> 13:21.064
Simmons a little slow to warm up this
quarter, but there's more to come.

13:21.066 --> 13:22.464
Yes!

13:22.466 --> 13:26.071
- Look, you get the teddy bear.
- Thank you.

13:27.538 --> 13:30.205
Everyone's a winner.

13:30.207 --> 13:32.374
Yeah. Cocktails.

13:32.376 --> 13:35.445
Looks like the Kookaburras
are starting to take control.

13:35.447 --> 13:38.614
Simmons, pick it up!

13:38.616 --> 13:41.584
- Okay, go.
- Ready?

13:41.586 --> 13:43.522
Oh!

13:45.523 --> 13:48.358
- Shit.
- What the hell was that?

13:48.360 --> 13:51.026
- Piss off, blondie.
- What?

13:51.028 --> 13:55.397
Whoa. And there's some heated words
there from the old and new captains.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.334
- There's...
- You two break it up. Come on.

13:58.336 --> 14:00.505
We're down by two.

14:04.509 --> 14:06.408
Oh, Bella, there you are.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.310
Have you any idea how
worried your mom is?

14:08.312 --> 14:10.412
I texted her.
Town has no reception.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.315
Well, look, for the rest of the trip,
let's just stay together, okay?

14:13.317 --> 14:15.984
No wandering off
on your own.

14:15.986 --> 14:19.223
Think you can just come back into our
lives and start telling us what to do?

14:31.101 --> 14:34.103
What? What's happened?

14:34.105 --> 14:38.107
Charity gigs.

14:38.109 --> 14:39.975
No more, Seth. No more.

15:29.693 --> 15:33.595
What? What's this? Do you
know anything about this?

15:33.597 --> 15:35.099
No, not at all.

15:37.168 --> 15:39.471
Marcus, what is that?

16:09.533 --> 16:11.066
Take cover!

16:31.188 --> 16:34.424
Stay! Stay here!
Stay here! Matt!

16:34.426 --> 16:36.695
Vanessa, stay there!

16:38.629 --> 16:41.766
Run, Jimmy!
Go, go, go, go! Go!

16:50.508 --> 16:54.844
Matt! Matt!
Marcus!

16:54.846 --> 16:58.250
- Amelia!
- Marcus, come here!

17:34.184 --> 17:36.387
Come on. Hey, this way.

17:37.855 --> 17:39.822
- Bella!
- Daddy!

17:39.824 --> 17:41.627
Bella!

17:43.193 --> 17:46.164
Bella, Bella, let's run!
Let's go!

17:50.201 --> 17:53.302
- Marcus. What the...?
- Where's your mom? Where's Helen?

17:53.304 --> 17:55.474
- Where's your mom?
- Ah!

17:58.143 --> 18:01.212
- Mom!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:03.714 --> 18:08.151
- Where's your mom? Shit.
- Mom, Mom!

18:10.154 --> 18:12.488
Mom! Matt, Matt, let me go!

18:12.490 --> 18:14.257
Let me... Mom!

18:14.259 --> 18:16.225
- Mom!
- Let's go.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.586
Get out of there!

18:45.656 --> 18:47.558
Move, move!

18:58.836 --> 19:01.807
- Where are we gonna go?
- Anywhere but here, kid.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.409
Shit!

19:06.411 --> 19:08.744
Hey! Hey!

19:08.746 --> 19:10.712
Come here! Hey, guys!

19:10.714 --> 19:12.717
This way!

19:14.352 --> 19:16.719
Jenny! Samuel!

19:16.721 --> 19:18.955
- Matty, Matty!
- I'm shot.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.958
You gotta help me. What if it's an artery?
I'm bloody toast.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.793
- Hey, is this your van?
- Yeah.

19:23.795 --> 19:26.828
- Jenny! Samuel!
- Let's go, let's go.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.663
Peter! Peter! Dad!

19:28.665 --> 19:30.967
Hey, is that your daughter?
We gotta go! Let's go!

19:30.969 --> 19:33.902
Yeah. I told them to meet me back here.
I can't leave without them!

19:33.904 --> 19:36.805
Hey, I promise you I'll help you
get the rest of your family back,

19:36.807 --> 19:38.373
- but right now we need to go.
- Dad!

19:38.375 --> 19:39.609
Or she is dead!

19:39.611 --> 19:41.180
Ah! Dad!

19:42.446 --> 19:43.748
Get in.

19:45.883 --> 19:47.352
Saddle up.

19:51.722 --> 19:54.356
Amelia! Come on!

19:55.727 --> 19:57.927
Close that!
Close that!

19:57.929 --> 20:00.763
- Vanessa! Come on!
- Come on, man! Start the car!

20:00.765 --> 20:03.769
Yeah, man.
I'm doing my best with this.

20:08.905 --> 20:11.373
- Vanessa!
- Amelia!

20:11.375 --> 20:13.845
Over here! Wait!
Come on!

20:17.048 --> 20:19.917
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

20:22.586 --> 20:24.388
We're getting close!

20:25.722 --> 20:27.590
- Jimmy!
- No!

20:27.592 --> 20:29.859
Jimmy! Jimmy, come on!

20:29.861 --> 20:33.595
Jackson! Jackson, please!
Jackson, we have to go!

20:33.597 --> 20:34.963
- Jimmy!
- Please, Jackson, leave him!

20:34.965 --> 20:36.931
No, I can't just leave him!
Jimmy!

20:36.933 --> 20:38.867
Jackson, get up! Please!

20:38.869 --> 20:41.671
Come on. Now!

20:41.673 --> 20:45.009
- Jimmy.
- Get in! Get in!

20:49.913 --> 20:51.817
Shit.

20:54.751 --> 20:58.456
Go! Go!
Get out of here!

21:10.034 --> 21:11.436
Careful!

21:18.509 --> 21:21.344
Whoa! Let's go!

21:21.346 --> 21:23.582
Wait a minute! Get out of the way!
I've got this!

21:33.124 --> 21:35.591
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

21:38.895 --> 21:40.898
Get out of the way.

21:49.006 --> 21:50.475
Left, left, left!

21:55.980 --> 21:59.047
- Hey, what's your name?
- Peter.

21:59.049 --> 22:03.486
- You sure about this, Peter?
- I hope so.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.924
- Hold on.
- Oh, shit.

22:18.736 --> 22:21.003
- Hey, what are you doing?
- No, it's okay, it's okay.

22:21.005 --> 22:22.805
I'm a nurse. Vanessa.

22:22.807 --> 22:25.440
Seth, 97.1, you know,
the country smile on your dial.

22:25.442 --> 22:30.014
- Sorry, I don't...
- Oh, that's all right. No one does.

22:37.622 --> 22:41.724
Can someone tell me
what the hell is going on?

22:41.726 --> 22:43.726
It's a terrorist attack.

22:43.728 --> 22:46.461
Hey, babe, you okay?
You hurt?

22:46.463 --> 22:50.732
- Shit. I don't like the look of this.
- Oh, crap!

22:50.734 --> 22:52.870
- What do we do now?
- Keep going!

22:54.939 --> 22:56.872
- Did anyone see that?
- Shit, it's behind us!

22:56.874 --> 22:59.842
- Can this thing go any faster?
- This is going faster.

22:59.844 --> 23:03.115
Oh, my God! We're doomed!

23:10.654 --> 23:14.190
That was Air Force, one of ours.

23:14.192 --> 23:17.026
Keep the engine running.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.663
Move.

23:20.664 --> 23:22.131
Hey, whoa, whoa.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.865
Hey, do you think
this is a good idea,

23:23.867 --> 23:25.668
just stopping out
here in the middle,

23:25.670 --> 23:28.440
in the, like, in the open,
in the... Jesus.

23:31.608 --> 23:33.912
Jesus.

23:35.880 --> 23:40.649
- What are you looking for?
- Markings.

23:40.651 --> 23:42.183
Pilot.

23:42.185 --> 23:45.156
What if the
pilot's still alive?

23:46.757 --> 23:48.990
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.429
Why not?

23:53.029 --> 23:54.863
It's not a man.

23:54.865 --> 23:56.097
Drone, maybe.

23:56.099 --> 23:58.933
Matt! Amelia!

23:58.935 --> 24:00.638
Get back in the van.

24:05.843 --> 24:09.245
- What are you doing?
- You staying? You coming? What's going on?

24:09.247 --> 24:11.514
- Dude, crap or get off the pot.
- Matt.

24:11.516 --> 24:13.951
Just drive. Drive.
Leave him.

24:20.892 --> 24:23.526
Matt?
Matt, is that you?

24:23.528 --> 24:25.827
Oh.

24:25.829 --> 24:28.162
Bloody good to see you.

24:28.164 --> 24:32.034
We're all up shit creek
now, eh, boys?

24:32.036 --> 24:33.835
Dennis?

24:33.837 --> 24:35.837
What the hell are you doing
in the back of Arnold's Ute?

24:35.839 --> 24:38.274
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to jump in the back of a moving car?

24:38.276 --> 24:41.643
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

24:41.645 --> 24:44.145
- That's not mine.
- Hey, I know you.

24:44.147 --> 24:46.681
You stole my fruit
two weeks ago, didn't you?

24:46.683 --> 24:49.151
Boy, if I ever
bloody catch you...

24:49.153 --> 24:52.587
Are you seriously blowing up over some
fruit after what we've just seen?

24:52.589 --> 24:55.857
Besides, I know
where we can hide.

24:55.859 --> 24:57.992
Come on, then.

24:57.994 --> 24:59.594
Good luck.
We'll follow you.

25:00.897 --> 25:02.730
Hey!

25:02.732 --> 25:06.837
I used the bypass.
It is quicker.

25:16.681 --> 25:20.248
Hey, you okay?

25:20.250 --> 25:23.117
- Ness, talk to me.
- They just started shooting.

25:23.119 --> 25:27.590
- I know, babe.
- Everyone, our friends, Jimmy.

25:27.592 --> 25:29.057
Jackson,
what are we gonna do?

25:29.059 --> 25:31.059
Babe, it's okay.
All right? It's okay.

25:31.061 --> 25:33.328
It's behind us now.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.898
What about Peanut?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.936
We're gonna be okay.

26:03.361 --> 26:05.664
Just let yourselves in.

26:10.999 --> 26:11.900
What is this place?

26:11.902 --> 26:15.336
Oh, it was an old timber mill
before the town went to shit.

26:15.338 --> 26:18.774
Now, welcome
to Casa de Destitute.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.309
- How many more are there?
- Why so interested?

26:21.311 --> 26:23.144
Hey, quiet.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.215
I want to know
what your plan is.

26:26.217 --> 26:28.750
- My plan?
- Yeah.

26:28.752 --> 26:31.687
You promised, man. You promised
you'd help me find my family.

26:31.689 --> 26:33.188
Ease up, man.
I'm working on it.

26:33.190 --> 26:36.091
Okay. Did you find
anything at that crash?

26:36.093 --> 26:39.894
- Aliens.
- Jackson, I think we've all been through enough tonight.

26:39.896 --> 26:42.363
All right. Just, let's
all settle down, okay?

26:42.365 --> 26:45.734
Let's cover the cars, get some sleep, and
we'll figure out the rest in the morning.

26:45.736 --> 26:49.037
- Mm-hm.
- You guys get some. Someone's gotta stay on watch.

26:49.039 --> 26:52.341
- I'll give you a hand.
- Chin up, everyone.

26:52.343 --> 26:54.809
I got out of worse
situations than this.

26:54.811 --> 26:57.680
Been married three times.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.784
Don't touch my shit.

27:16.366 --> 27:21.402
You mean what you said in there?

27:21.404 --> 27:23.074
Which part?

27:24.307 --> 27:26.975
You all right?

27:26.977 --> 27:28.744
I'm great.

27:28.746 --> 27:31.479
About helping him
find his family.

27:33.851 --> 27:37.186
What do you want me
to say, Amelia?

27:37.188 --> 27:40.488
Yeah, yeah, I will help him
find his family.

27:40.490 --> 27:42.224
That an old bottle of pills
or a new one?

27:42.226 --> 27:45.227
Just give me a break,
will you!?

27:45.229 --> 27:46.798
Fuck.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.770
I'm sorry.

28:01.979 --> 28:03.682
I'm sorry.

28:05.281 --> 28:10.154
- I'm scared, baby.
- It's okay.

28:12.823 --> 28:16.061
I'm sure our guys
are fighting back right now.

28:18.762 --> 28:20.328
- Let's hope so.
- Hey.

28:20.330 --> 28:22.998
- What are you doing here?
- Building a fire pit.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.501
- No, I mean, here with us.
- Oh, I don't know.

28:26.503 --> 28:29.103
Just, um, lucky, I guess.

28:29.105 --> 28:33.044
- I used to write.
- Cool.

28:36.846 --> 28:38.817
Hey...

28:41.218 --> 28:43.788
What are you
doing there, kid?

28:45.221 --> 28:49.391
No one calls me kid
except Matt. I'm Marcus.

28:49.393 --> 28:52.928
And there's a lot of us and not much
food or water that has to last.

28:52.930 --> 28:57.032
So before you interrupted me, I was
trying to work out our daily rations.

28:57.034 --> 29:01.973
Okay, Rain Man, fine.
Jesus.

29:03.907 --> 29:05.540
What are you doing?

29:05.542 --> 29:07.209
Stripping back the bark
so that when it burns

29:07.211 --> 29:10.478
it creates as little smoke
as possible.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.247
Okay. Let me help.

29:12.249 --> 29:17.822
Hey, Marcus. Wanna come help
find some branches, help Dennis?

29:19.490 --> 29:21.358
Okay.

29:27.096 --> 29:29.297
Matty! Matt!

29:29.299 --> 29:31.802
Babe, are you okay?
What's wrong?

29:35.005 --> 29:38.510
You gotta see this.

30:10.207 --> 30:12.410
I told you it was aliens.

30:18.582 --> 30:21.019
We are toast.

30:51.315 --> 30:53.515
Hey, what are you doing?
Some of those bags are mine.

30:53.517 --> 30:56.584
- I'm leaving.
- We need to stick together.

30:56.586 --> 30:58.487
What together?

30:58.489 --> 31:00.154
Okay, I don't owe you anything,

31:00.156 --> 31:02.524
especially now that
we've got a kid on the way.

31:02.526 --> 31:04.392
No, I just
found out yesterday and...

31:04.394 --> 31:07.062
- Congratulations.
- Vanessa, why didn't you tell me?

31:07.064 --> 31:11.603
Well, I don't even know
if I should have it...

31:14.003 --> 31:18.105
Come on, baby, we'll get
as far away from here as we can.

31:18.107 --> 31:21.142
No, hands off.
These are mine. Piss off.

31:21.144 --> 31:23.312
What if it's
the same everywhere?

31:23.314 --> 31:25.447
Yeah, well, we're gonna
have to take that chance.

31:25.449 --> 31:28.182
So whoever wants to get
out of Dodge, we're going.

31:28.184 --> 31:31.652
- I'll go.
- Arnold?

31:31.654 --> 31:34.189
Can't do it, Jack-o.

31:34.191 --> 31:36.424
You can have my truck
if you want.

31:36.426 --> 31:39.126
I've got no need for it now.

31:39.128 --> 31:42.663
Thank you. Dennis?

31:42.665 --> 31:45.566
With those ships they have, you
two'll be like sitting ducks.

31:45.568 --> 31:48.202
Well, we'll stay
off the road, man.

31:48.204 --> 31:52.975
- What about when the baby comes?
- Vanessa's a nurse.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.079
She can...

31:56.613 --> 31:59.613
What's your plan, Matt?

31:59.615 --> 32:02.683
Stay? Fight?

32:02.685 --> 32:06.488
I mean, I've been in a few bar brawls, but I
doubt anyone here has ever been in a gun battle.

32:06.490 --> 32:08.356
- Huh?
- Peter has.

32:08.358 --> 32:12.163
- Bella.
- He was one of the Bankstown boys.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.199
Great.

32:21.337 --> 32:22.738
Have you ever
killed another man?

32:22.740 --> 32:26.243
- Yeah. He's been in...
- Bella, please.

32:28.746 --> 32:32.146
Well, to be quite honest, I've been
inside for the last seven years.

32:32.148 --> 32:34.682
I've only been out
for about a month.

32:34.684 --> 32:38.152
- Well, that's just perfect.
- What's that supposed to mean, mate?

32:38.154 --> 32:42.090
I've paid my debt. I was in
the middle of moving my family

32:42.092 --> 32:44.125
as far away from that
city life as I could get.

32:44.127 --> 32:46.460
Okay.

32:46.462 --> 32:49.730
Well, I'm no killer,

32:49.732 --> 32:52.700
but I was a crack shot with
a rifle in the army reserve.

32:52.702 --> 32:56.238
Mind you, that was
a good 30 years ago.

32:56.240 --> 33:01.308
- I can fight.
- Now why would we believe anything you say?

33:01.310 --> 33:04.712
- You wanna find out, mustache?
- Anytime..

33:04.714 --> 33:10.053
- What was that?
- Look, we got a murderer and a bum. It's over.

33:11.221 --> 33:13.223
We're going, Vanessa. Come on.

33:20.064 --> 33:24.099
You wanna go, go.

33:24.101 --> 33:26.535
I'm going back
to the town.

33:26.537 --> 33:29.207
Find out what happened
to our families.

33:32.742 --> 33:34.644
Good luck, Jack-o.

33:45.756 --> 33:48.155
- You guys should stay.
- Mm-hmm.

33:48.157 --> 33:50.324
If there's one thing I know
about Dad, he's a fighter.

33:50.326 --> 33:54.365
Yeah, we'll all take care
of each other, right?

33:56.333 --> 33:59.704
Twenty-four hours,
and then we'll decide.

34:05.741 --> 34:07.545
Shit.

34:09.179 --> 34:12.416
All right.
Spread out, be careful.

34:34.538 --> 34:36.338
- This is stupid.
- Shh!

34:36.340 --> 34:37.905
How are we supposed
to fight them if they see us?

34:37.907 --> 34:39.710
Shut up.

34:41.244 --> 34:42.547
Baby, stay.

34:54.824 --> 34:56.489
Take that.

34:56.492 --> 35:00.195
- Here, here, we gotta move.
- Are you serious?

35:00.197 --> 35:03.634
Christ. If we come across
anything, we'll just build a gun.

35:27.858 --> 35:34.231
- What the hell are they doing?
- Making themselves at home.

36:01.324 --> 36:04.425
- Mrs. Kyle.
- Dennis. Matty.

36:04.427 --> 36:07.329
- Get away, as far as you can.
- Have you seen my mom?

36:07.331 --> 36:08.862
They moved her today
with some of the others.

36:08.864 --> 36:11.900
- Have you seen these two?
- Those poor kids.

36:11.902 --> 36:14.469
It'll be okay, Mrs. Kyle.

36:14.471 --> 36:18.305
They're coming!
Go, run, go!

36:18.307 --> 36:20.941
Just stay alive, okay? We're
coming back, just stay alive.

37:05.655 --> 37:07.824
Okay. Go.

37:17.034 --> 37:20.034
How did we end up with
a nurse of our own, huh?

37:20.036 --> 37:22.503
That's...
that's just crazy luck.

37:22.505 --> 37:24.673
Yeah, well, I'm still in my
three year training period,

37:24.675 --> 37:27.976
- so I wouldn't be so sure.
- Oops, amputated the wrong leg.

37:29.980 --> 37:33.451
Don't be so modest.
It's only another year, babe.

37:35.052 --> 37:38.086
What am I saying?

37:38.088 --> 37:42.724
- Try not to dwell, son.
- Yeah, it's hard not to.

37:42.726 --> 37:45.360
I've wasted the last ten years
of my life on social media.

37:45.362 --> 37:48.662
Yeah, yeah, I know, me too.

37:48.664 --> 37:52.434
Hashtag "bestdayever."
Hashtag "TGIF."

37:52.436 --> 37:59.007
Hashtag "it's-the-end of-the
world-we're-all-gonna-die who-gives-a-shit?"

37:59.009 --> 38:01.943
Something's wrong.
They should be back by now.

38:01.945 --> 38:03.748
Easy.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.548
I'm gonna give it another hour

38:06.550 --> 38:07.882
and then we're leaving.

38:07.884 --> 38:09.516
Yeah.
I'm getting a bad feeling.

38:09.518 --> 38:11.485
- We can't just leave.
- I know, baby,

38:11.487 --> 38:13.588
but we have to think
about the rest of us.

38:13.590 --> 38:15.055
Look, take it easy,
all right?

38:15.057 --> 38:18.425
Look, I said relax, mate.

38:18.427 --> 38:20.764
No one's going anywhere.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.603
Take a load off.

38:32.708 --> 38:35.045
What are you doing, Pete?

38:36.847 --> 38:39.847
- Oh, that's just great.
- Okay. Let him go.

38:39.849 --> 38:41.985
Just be cool.

38:46.088 --> 38:49.492
Hey, you wanna go back inside?
I can stay out here.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.427
Where's Mom?

38:52.429 --> 38:55.063
It's us.

38:55.065 --> 38:56.498
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.800
- Yeah, we're fine.
- Yeah.

38:58.802 --> 39:01.105
What's going on down there?

39:04.641 --> 39:07.842
- Did you see Mom?
- Thanks.

39:07.844 --> 39:11.615
- Jenny, Samuel?
- No.

39:14.184 --> 39:16.050
Everyone's been taken
to the old factory.

39:16.052 --> 39:18.619
It's like a livestock paddock,

39:18.621 --> 39:21.488
except we're the livestock.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.958
The bastards are here
for the long haul.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.528
What, do you speak alien?
How do you know?

39:26.530 --> 39:27.898
Because we saw them...

39:34.670 --> 39:38.108
You led them right to us.

39:44.481 --> 39:46.851
- Behind here.
- Go, go, go.

39:49.652 --> 39:53.123
Okay. Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

40:55.018 --> 40:56.586
You son of a bitch!

40:58.788 --> 41:00.824
Matt, Matt.

41:07.530 --> 41:09.967
You expect
a welcome party, bitch?

41:45.135 --> 41:47.838
Oh! Ah!

41:57.581 --> 42:00.615
Hold him down,
hold him down!

42:00.617 --> 42:02.150
Hold him down, Arnold.
Get his leg!

42:02.152 --> 42:05.054
Grab it! Grab it!

42:24.740 --> 42:27.742
Hold him down. Get his leg!

42:27.744 --> 42:30.748
- Grab it! Grab it!
- Hold him down!

42:31.914 --> 42:33.715
Hold him!

42:33.717 --> 42:36.887
Clear shot, better watch now,
watch out!

42:38.954 --> 42:40.990
Pull his head back,
pull his head back!

42:42.257 --> 42:44.160
Pull his head back!

42:51.800 --> 42:57.974
Die, you son of a bitch!

43:05.748 --> 43:08.383
Well, that was your best
tackle of the season.

43:08.385 --> 43:11.918
Arnold's hurt.

43:11.920 --> 43:15.123
- Oh, God.
- You're crazy, old man, you know that?

43:15.125 --> 43:18.860
Ah! Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

43:18.862 --> 43:20.961
Guys, we gotta go. Now.

43:20.963 --> 43:25.066
And we're taking these bodies with us.
Grab those guns, too.

43:25.068 --> 43:29.103
Thanks, Pete.
Thank you.

43:29.105 --> 43:31.875
Let's get rid
of this thing, huh?

43:44.119 --> 43:48.389
They're
gonna hunt us down now.

43:48.391 --> 43:50.458
We just started a war.

43:50.460 --> 43:52.963
We're already at war.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.800
Son of a bitch.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.001
Oh.

44:06.275 --> 44:11.848
Oh, that's...

44:13.083 --> 44:16.286
- You all right?
- That's just...

44:18.755 --> 44:21.188
- Matty. Matt.
- Matt. No, no, no, don't.

44:21.190 --> 44:22.456
You don't know
what that will do.

44:22.458 --> 44:25.094
What have we got to lose?

44:30.032 --> 44:31.465
Holy shit.

44:31.467 --> 44:37.340
- What do you see?
- Everything.

44:44.880 --> 44:47.882
- And nothing.
- What?

44:50.253 --> 44:52.186
Give me a look?

44:52.188 --> 44:53.854
Careful, baby, it's heavy.

44:53.856 --> 44:55.155
It stinks.

44:55.157 --> 44:58.325
The helmets pick up
anything alive.

44:58.327 --> 45:03.831
Out here there's so much life
that... we're invisible.

45:03.833 --> 45:06.767
Maybe where they're from, there
isn't any other life to see.

45:06.769 --> 45:12.041
These guys are here to stay. We want this
back, we're gonna have to do something.

45:14.277 --> 45:16.443
Hm. Let's do it, then.

45:16.445 --> 45:19.045
I'm with you till the end.

45:19.047 --> 45:21.951
That's more like it.

45:24.019 --> 45:25.853
Invisible, eh?

45:25.855 --> 45:28.492
Bastards won't know
what hit 'em.

45:34.030 --> 45:37.465
These things are a little
different from our rifles.

45:37.467 --> 45:39.800
But the same principle applies.

45:39.802 --> 45:45.305
Anyone's grandma can shoot a target
20 feet away in broad daylight.

45:45.307 --> 45:49.480
We gotta be faster than them,
smarter than them.

45:51.581 --> 45:54.849
And when you're ready,
the shot must be released

45:54.851 --> 45:58.519
<i>without any disturbance
to the firer's position.</i>

45:58.521 --> 46:02.222
Alrighty. Take aim.

46:02.224 --> 46:04.393
<i>Breathe in.</i>

46:05.460 --> 46:07.195
Take 'em down.

46:29.853 --> 46:32.485
Greetings, Earthlings. Come
with me if you want to live.

46:32.487 --> 46:35.423
Always wanted to say that.
You're heavy.

46:35.425 --> 46:39.028
Come on, let's go.
Has anyone seen my mom?

46:40.329 --> 46:42.429
You the last?

46:42.431 --> 46:44.097
Arnold.

46:44.099 --> 46:47.471
Arnold, let's go.
Jackson, come on.

47:04.186 --> 47:06.289
Hello.

47:08.224 --> 47:10.057
Where to start today?

47:10.059 --> 47:11.626
<i>Dad's still clinging
to the hope</i>

47:11.628 --> 47:15.295
<i>that Mom and Sammy
are alive out there.</i>

47:15.297 --> 47:18.199
<i>I'm trying to believe it.</i>

47:18.201 --> 47:20.001
Hey, hey. Here.

47:20.003 --> 47:21.635
<i>I'm not sure
if I'm that naive anymore.</i>

47:21.637 --> 47:24.237
Come on, you must be exhausted,
here, here.

47:24.239 --> 47:26.941
- <i>If you're watching...</i>
- <i>Here. Here you go.</i>

47:26.943 --> 47:29.146
...I miss you.

47:30.213 --> 47:31.646
We're doing good, right?

47:31.648 --> 47:33.383
Yeah.

47:34.550 --> 47:38.286
<i>I'm fighting for you.</i>

47:38.288 --> 47:40.655
<i>The others are kicking ass.</i>

47:40.657 --> 47:44.925
<i>Um, Marcus and I
have been building armor,</i>

47:44.927 --> 47:48.065
<i>repairing clothes
for survivors.</i>

47:52.568 --> 47:54.972
He's a good kid.

48:00.510 --> 48:03.110
I don't... I don't even know
who's gonna watch this.

48:03.112 --> 48:07.548
These are the best
seats in the house, babe.

48:07.550 --> 48:09.349
Yeah, my view
isn't too bad either.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.421
I hope the baby
gets your eyes.

48:14.423 --> 48:17.260
I hope the baby
gets your strength.

48:20.128 --> 48:23.164
I couldn't do this
without you, baby.

48:23.166 --> 48:26.603
We're gonna get
through this... somehow.

48:27.670 --> 48:29.269
Yeah.

48:29.271 --> 48:32.273
So you do that,
cut off their supplies,

48:32.275 --> 48:34.441
it also hits their morale.

48:34.443 --> 48:38.579
Now, we just need to figure out
what's strategic to them.

48:38.581 --> 48:42.583
An occupying force can
be brought to its knees,

48:42.585 --> 48:46.356
if you have the will
and the drive to fight.

48:47.724 --> 48:51.061
I just never thought
we'd be the ones occupied.

48:52.394 --> 48:55.028
Okay. Bella, compression
on the head wound.

48:55.030 --> 48:57.597
Bella, you got this.

48:57.599 --> 48:59.566
Okay. Bandages.

48:59.568 --> 49:01.534
Keep that there,
now check her for vital signs.

49:01.536 --> 49:04.438
- Yeah. She's gonna be okay.
- You're gonna be okay.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.275
Yeah.

49:20.623 --> 49:23.226
Guys, they're
poisoning the water.

49:34.536 --> 49:38.072
- Hey, where's, um...
- We're out.

49:38.074 --> 49:41.211
- The creeks...
- Higher ground, boys.

49:52.221 --> 49:53.757
Come on.

50:01.731 --> 50:03.563
We got people here
looking to us to lead.

50:03.565 --> 50:06.499
- You guys wanna get in the fight?
- Yeah.

50:06.501 --> 50:08.637
Just get your
head right, mate.

50:36.498 --> 50:38.100
Let's go!

50:42.237 --> 50:43.806
Move, move!

51:03.126 --> 51:07.164
I guess it's important to
document the end of the world.

51:11.434 --> 51:16.673
If anyone finds this,
we really tried.

51:36.692 --> 51:40.394
Hey, hey.

51:40.396 --> 51:42.530
Matt.

51:42.532 --> 51:44.664
We're not gonna hurt you.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.802
Hey.

51:48.503 --> 51:50.938
I'm Amelia.

51:50.940 --> 51:54.575
- What's your name?
- Chloe.

51:54.577 --> 51:56.911
Where did you get the gun,
Chloe?

51:56.913 --> 51:59.115
Found... found it.

52:01.416 --> 52:03.717
- You wanna put it down?
- No.

52:03.719 --> 52:06.556
- Okay.
- How did you get away?

52:07.789 --> 52:10.324
I crawled.

52:10.326 --> 52:13.563
Hey, hey.

52:15.231 --> 52:16.867
Did they do this?

52:31.780 --> 52:35.349
They've got the rest out here
just planting for their food.

52:35.351 --> 52:38.385
Okay.
Chloe, Chloe.

52:38.387 --> 52:41.921
It's okay. Look at me.
It's okay.

52:41.923 --> 52:46.630
Give me the gun.
It's okay.

52:49.264 --> 52:51.498
They know
everything about us.

52:51.500 --> 52:54.001
Some are slaves.

52:54.003 --> 52:55.668
Some are...
Some are like me.

52:55.670 --> 52:57.338
Okay. Okay.

52:57.340 --> 53:00.273
- Take it, take it. Take it.
- Okay.

53:00.275 --> 53:03.276
- Okay.
- Baby, baby, we got to move.

53:03.278 --> 53:06.012
No, no!

53:06.014 --> 53:09.550
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- No!

53:27.769 --> 53:29.505
Come on!

53:36.278 --> 53:38.278
- This is the place?
- Yup.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.713
Every night this week they've
dropped off more, right here.

53:40.715 --> 53:42.883
- You checked the detonators?
- Yeah.

53:42.885 --> 53:44.584
- And the wires?
- Yeah.

53:44.586 --> 53:45.853
- What about the...
- Yeah, man, it's cool.

53:45.855 --> 53:49.490
I got it. Jesus.

53:49.492 --> 53:51.557
We've got problems.

53:51.559 --> 53:55.362
Okay. Shh. Quiet.

53:55.364 --> 53:56.800
Here it comes.

54:11.447 --> 54:15.818
- Yeah! Good one!
- Told you, I told you.

55:05.034 --> 55:10.070
Hello. What...

55:10.072 --> 55:12.873
Slow down, slow down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

55:12.875 --> 55:15.778
You should have seen it blow.
Boom.

55:17.512 --> 55:20.079
Hey, I'll be back.

55:20.081 --> 55:22.885
Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.

55:34.864 --> 55:38.034
Remember, always aim
ahead of the bow.

55:50.646 --> 55:53.416
Hey. You guys better see this.

56:10.733 --> 56:12.499
What have you done?

56:12.501 --> 56:14.668
We've been doing it
your way for months.

56:14.670 --> 56:16.804
It's time we start
listening to someone else.

56:16.806 --> 56:19.106
How do you know
they can't track him?

56:19.108 --> 56:21.577
We're not stupid,
we checked it over.

56:22.878 --> 56:26.079
- Whoa.
- How the hell did you do it?

56:26.081 --> 56:29.148
We caught two of them off guard.

56:29.150 --> 56:32.019
The other one got Amy and Jean
Claude before Bella shot it.

56:32.021 --> 56:35.822
That's not the deal, Bella. You're
not supposed to go after them.

56:35.824 --> 56:37.990
- Relax, Pete, she did good.
- I'm not talking to you.

56:37.992 --> 56:41.195
- You disobeyed me.
- You're kidding.

56:41.197 --> 56:44.965
Who do you think was looking
after our family?

56:44.967 --> 56:49.539
- I don't want to hear it.
- This is bullshit.

56:55.143 --> 56:59.213
What about you?
What were you thinking, hm?

56:59.215 --> 57:01.815
Thinking that I was actually
doing something for once.

57:01.817 --> 57:05.688
I can really help.
I'm not a kid anymore.

57:12.760 --> 57:15.864
They're experimenting
on humans.

57:17.833 --> 57:21.838
- How do you know that?
- I know.

57:22.905 --> 57:25.137
We gotta bust them out of there.

57:25.139 --> 57:28.608
Yeah. I'm with you
on that, Arnold.

57:28.610 --> 57:31.144
And what do we do
with this thing, huh?

57:31.146 --> 57:33.947
You're experimenting on us,
are you?

57:33.949 --> 57:38.918
Get off me, get off me!

57:38.920 --> 57:41.153
- Enemy soldier!
- I haven't finished with him.

57:41.155 --> 57:43.557
Let's just sit on this before
doing anything rash, all right?

57:43.559 --> 57:45.829
Come on, mate, let's go.

57:46.896 --> 57:50.097
Sort your shit out.

57:50.099 --> 57:52.199
Jackson, just put it
out of its misery.

57:52.201 --> 57:53.566
- What?
- No.

57:53.568 --> 57:55.101
Look at it.
This isn't right.

57:55.103 --> 57:57.537
- I don't like this.
- What would you like?

57:57.539 --> 58:00.943
- I need to talk to you, now.
- What?

58:06.282 --> 58:08.115
Why did you
let them do that?

58:08.117 --> 58:10.550
- Can you blame them?
- Hmm.

58:10.552 --> 58:14.054
What good is beating the shit
out of it gonna do anyone?

58:14.056 --> 58:16.789
They invaded us.
Maybe they deserve it.

58:16.791 --> 58:19.159
Yeah. Columbus found America,

58:19.161 --> 58:21.862
Cook found Australia, they were never the
same again. These guys aren't leaving.

58:21.864 --> 58:26.133
So, what? You want
to give up, let them kill us?

58:26.135 --> 58:29.302
- Your mom?
- No. Mm-mm.

58:29.304 --> 58:32.338
I want us to be real
about this, okay?

58:32.340 --> 58:34.675
That big ship in the sky,
it's not going anywhere.

58:34.677 --> 58:38.278
We all know it. We need to accept
that the life that we had is gone.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.717
- Bullshit.
- It's gone.

58:42.117 --> 58:44.521
I love you.

58:46.655 --> 58:50.793
I do not accept any other life
than one we choose for each other.

58:58.266 --> 59:00.133
Vanessa.

59:00.135 --> 59:02.202
Why did you have to bring it
back here, huh?

59:02.204 --> 59:05.137
What? I was trying to help.
Suddenly I'm the bad guy?

59:05.139 --> 59:09.642
You're not a bad guy, but
you have to control your ego.

59:09.644 --> 59:11.811
- My ego, wow.
- You know what I mean.

59:11.813 --> 59:14.648
It's just, like, you're
always trying to be the best,

59:14.650 --> 59:18.084
but this isn't a game, Jackson.
All right?

59:18.086 --> 59:20.287
Slow down,
let them run this.

59:20.289 --> 59:23.893
I need you around
when the baby arrives.

01:00:31.427 --> 01:00:33.262
What are you doing?

01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:49.041
Bella? Bella.

01:00:49.043 --> 01:00:50.342
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:50.344 --> 01:00:52.012
- What?
- You okay?

01:00:52.014 --> 01:00:54.014
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you're okay?

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:55.414
Yes.

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:58.855
Your dad, he just
doesn't quit, does he?

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:01.987
What's that?

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:08.961
Oh, it's about $9,634.25.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.867
- Dennis?
- No, it's good.

01:01:13.869 --> 01:01:16.235
It's good. It's good.

01:01:16.237 --> 01:01:18.905
It's a new world, right?
Come on.

01:01:18.907 --> 01:01:22.876
I mean, everything we should
value we have here, right?

01:01:22.878 --> 01:01:28.184
People, family,
relationships. That shit...

01:01:29.751 --> 01:01:31.318
It doesn't matter anymore.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.755
Yeah.

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:37.523
You should try it.
You should try something new.

01:01:37.525 --> 01:01:40.159
- What?
- Try something new.

01:01:40.161 --> 01:01:44.097
It's a new world. So anything
connected to the old world...

01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:45.965
Go on. Try it.
What have you got?

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:47.367
You got a thousand pockets
in this thing.

01:01:47.369 --> 01:01:49.101
You gotta
have something in here.

01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:50.537
- No. I don't...
- What have... what's this?

01:01:50.539 --> 01:01:53.373
Okay, nice. Try it.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:55.175
Trust me.

01:01:55.177 --> 01:01:57.543
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

01:01:57.545 --> 01:02:00.780
Nice.

01:02:00.782 --> 01:02:03.349
Oh, my God.

01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:07.723
Actually, I've got
something for you.

01:02:08.791 --> 01:02:11.059
It might be of value.

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:16.231
- What is it?
- Open it.

01:02:19.534 --> 01:02:22.904
- Is that me?
- Hmm.

01:02:33.148 --> 01:02:38.284
So they've been watching us for centuries,
just planning? Why did they wait so long?

01:02:38.286 --> 01:02:42.521
It doesn't really
matter what they want.

01:02:42.523 --> 01:02:46.425
Their plans don't
include us hanging around.

01:02:46.427 --> 01:02:48.295
You know what
we have to do, huh?

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:50.800
What do we have to do?

01:02:56.838 --> 01:03:00.139
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Peter, what are you doing?

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:02.575
Right, I get you want your family back.
But this is nuts.

01:03:02.577 --> 01:03:05.211
Look, the only way to get our planet
back is to kill enough of them

01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:07.613
- until they lose the will to fight.
- You don't know them.

01:03:07.615 --> 01:03:09.583
This thing has information,
this thing can help us.

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.584
We don't know what's
going on out there, Pete.

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:12.952
I know what will happen
if you don't get out of my way.

01:03:12.954 --> 01:03:14.487
Matt, Pete, Pete.

01:03:14.489 --> 01:03:16.055
Just calm down.
Calm down, all right?

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:20.526
You don't like it?
Piss off!

01:04:20.621 --> 01:04:23.125
Are you proud of yourself?

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:26.494
What about you, boy?

01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:31.900
Why don't you piss off back
to jail where you belong?

01:04:57.525 --> 01:04:58.994
Listen up.

01:05:01.362 --> 01:05:03.095
We're going back to the factory.

01:05:03.097 --> 01:05:05.498
We're getting our people out.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.168
- Any volunteers to go on a supply run?
- Let me go.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:11.271
- Got a list of every person from town.
- Where's your sister?

01:05:11.273 --> 01:05:14.074
- She left on her own.
- I'm ready, Matt.

01:05:14.076 --> 01:05:18.644
That's why you're coming with us.
Get your gear, kid.

01:05:18.646 --> 01:05:20.412
So, what are you gonna
say to Amelia, huh?

01:05:20.414 --> 01:05:22.081
Amelia's not here.

01:05:22.083 --> 01:05:24.383
We've just gotten back
from another all-nighter.

01:05:24.385 --> 01:05:26.219
- We're tired.
- Then don't go.

01:05:26.221 --> 01:05:28.988
Matt, these guys are exhausted.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:31.157
They're gonna
make mistakes out there.

01:05:31.159 --> 01:05:34.427
We fight or we die.

01:05:34.429 --> 01:05:37.998
I'm sick
of digging graves, man.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.235
How about you?

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:45.237
Coming?

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:47.273
Hey, no.
We talked about this.

01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:50.142
Yeah. But the baby,
all right?

01:05:50.144 --> 01:05:52.244
We need supplies.

01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:57.118
- Be careful, okay?
- I'll be careful.

01:05:59.054 --> 01:06:01.157
Be back soon, baby.

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:07.686
- You and I need to have a little talk.
- Yeah?

01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:12.694
- You done killing prisoners?
- Don't be smart, boy.

01:07:14.728 --> 01:07:18.798
- She's my little girl.
- Oh. Oh, right, that.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.599
Okay. What?

01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:23.603
Hey, I'm her stepdad, maybe
I'm a little overprotective.

01:07:23.605 --> 01:07:26.873
But what I don't like
is some shithead like you

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:30.577
taking advantage
of an opportunity.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:33.646
Well, I don't know what
you want me to say, Pete.

01:07:33.648 --> 01:07:35.548
They're just drawings.

01:07:35.550 --> 01:07:38.150
You are this close, mate.
You are this close.

01:07:38.152 --> 01:07:40.653
Hey, Ness, Ness, Ness.

01:07:40.655 --> 01:07:42.621
- Yeah.
- You all right?

01:07:42.623 --> 01:07:44.356
You okay?

01:07:44.358 --> 01:07:45.624
Just stay away from her, okay?

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:47.193
It's all right.
You can go inside.

01:07:49.864 --> 01:07:53.633
All right. Get inside.
Get inside, please. Oh!

01:07:53.635 --> 01:07:54.733
- I got you. I got you.
- Oh.

01:07:54.735 --> 01:07:56.436
- Bella!
- It's okay.

01:07:56.438 --> 01:07:58.137
Look at me. It's okay.

01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:00.373
It's okay. It's okay.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:02.842
- Oh!
- Okay. Breathe. Breathe.

01:08:02.844 --> 01:08:05.211
- Vanessa, over here.
- Okay.

01:08:05.213 --> 01:08:07.646
- Breathe. Come on.
- You okay?

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:09.816
- Where's Jackson?
- He's out on a run. They all are.

01:08:09.818 --> 01:08:11.617
- It's okay. We're gonna help.
- Seth, Seth.

01:08:11.619 --> 01:08:13.853
Go out and find someone who
can help, anybody, a nurse.

01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:16.788
She is a nurse. You've had two kids.
You must know something.

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:18.691
Look, I wasn't there
for either of them.

01:08:18.693 --> 01:08:20.393
All right. I'm gonna
walk you through this, okay?

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.828
Okay.

01:08:22.831 --> 01:08:24.930
- I'll go find Jackson.
- Oh! Okay.

01:08:24.932 --> 01:08:26.732
Okay. Squeeze as hard
as you like.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:28.268
- What's going on?
- Her baby's coming.

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:29.768
Whoa. Hey, Ness.

01:08:29.770 --> 01:08:31.336
- It's okay.
- Bella.

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:32.404
- I'm here.
- Okay.

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.559
Just relax. It's all right. You can do this.

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.627
- Vanessa, tell me what you need.
- I wanna wait for Jackson.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:57.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Dennis is gonna get him.

01:08:57.332 --> 01:08:59.299
- Can I just wait for Jackson?
- This baby isn't...

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:00.799
- Please, I need Jackson here.
- This baby isn't gonna wait.

01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:02.835
Bella, have a look.
What's happening?

01:09:02.837 --> 01:09:03.769
It's happening.

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.911
Come on. Bella.

01:09:12.912 --> 01:09:15.514
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
That's it.

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:17.584
- It's happening too fast.
- Good girl. Come on.

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.852
Something's wrong. It's happening too fast.
Something's wrong.

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.653
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay.

01:09:21.654 --> 01:09:22.988
- No one's listening to me.
- You can do this.

01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:25.825
Everything you can carry, kid.
Move it.

01:09:25.827 --> 01:09:28.760
I want that 4x4 stripped
in 20 minutes, Jackson.

01:09:28.761 --> 01:09:30.729
Matt, the storm's setting in.
We're a long way out.

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:33.234
- Let's just get out of here, all right?
- We're pushing on.

01:09:39.474 --> 01:09:43.578
- What?
- Vanessa.

01:09:44.645 --> 01:09:46.912
Jackson. Jackson, no!

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:49.752
Jackson!
On your left!

01:09:58.726 --> 01:10:01.462
Come on, old man.
Don't you die on me.

01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:05.501
- Go!
- Ah!

01:10:07.034 --> 01:10:08.000
Matt!

01:10:08.002 --> 01:10:09.871
You can do this. Let's go.

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.574
- Shit.
- Run.

01:10:14.576 --> 01:10:16.442
- Let's get out of here.
- Get me out. Get me out!

01:10:16.444 --> 01:10:19.478
- Bella, grab the blaster!
- I've got it!

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:33.293
It's okay.

01:10:35.529 --> 01:10:38.464
Seth. Grab the gun, Seth.

01:10:38.466 --> 01:10:40.299
- Bella, over here.
- Okay.

01:10:40.301 --> 01:10:43.505
You're good. You're good.

01:10:57.819 --> 01:11:00.719
Grab his leg!
Move, move, move!

01:11:00.721 --> 01:11:04.025
- Go!
- Ah!

01:11:13.033 --> 01:11:15.902
Marcus, what's happening?
Marcus!

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:18.407
Marcus, what are you doing?

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:35.821
I can't, I can't!
I can't, I can't!

01:11:35.823 --> 01:11:38.691
It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:38.693 --> 01:11:40.927
They're killing them all.
They're killing them all.

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:43.995
- Here, bite down on this.
- I know!

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:46.465
- You gotta keep quiet!
- Stop it!

01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:48.604
Please keep her quiet!

01:11:50.137 --> 01:11:53.438
- Slow down. Choose your targets.
- Arnold, is he alive?

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.478
- Dennis.
- Come here, keep an eye on our six.

01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:03.652
It's okay. It's okay!

01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:07.387
- Come on!
- No, I can't! I can't!

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:08.888
You can do this.
Keep going. Keep going.

01:12:08.890 --> 01:12:11.491
- Oh, my God!
- We can see the head.

01:12:11.493 --> 01:12:13.058
- Keep breathing!
- You gotta work with me!

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.696
They're gonna hear us!
They're gonna hear us!

01:12:20.435 --> 01:12:22.101
It's coming.
You're getting there.

01:12:31.078 --> 01:12:34.048
Push this kid out now.

01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:49.428
Shit!

01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:52.098
Shut up!

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.871
Get out of here!

01:12:57.204 --> 01:12:59.938
It's okay. It's just you and me.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.174
We're gonna be okay.

01:13:02.877 --> 01:13:04.643
Oh, my God! It's okay.

01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:07.179
She's coming.
She's coming.

01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:09.449
- Daddy!
- No!

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:13.820
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:16.656
Oh, a baby!
You've got a baby girl.

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:21.193
It's a baby girl. Oh, it's so beautiful.

01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:23.196
You have a baby girl.

01:13:25.966 --> 01:13:28.134
Motherfucker!

01:13:28.136 --> 01:13:30.102
Fuck you!

01:13:30.104 --> 01:13:32.941
Jackson's gonna be
so proud of you.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:38.611
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

01:13:42.182 --> 01:13:46.218
I love you so much.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:49.023
- Tell Jackson...
- Yeah?

01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:52.657
Allison.

01:13:52.659 --> 01:13:54.794
Vanessa?

01:13:54.796 --> 01:13:58.531
Vanessa! Vanessa!

01:13:58.533 --> 01:14:00.199
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:02.535
Oh, my God!
There's a lot of blood!

01:14:02.537 --> 01:14:04.803
Dad! There's so much blood!

01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:07.072
Dad! Wake up!

01:14:07.074 --> 01:14:09.141
Hey, wake up!

01:14:09.143 --> 01:14:12.480
Wake up!

01:14:15.082 --> 01:14:18.183
- Come on. Come on.
- It's okay. It's gonna be fine.

01:14:18.185 --> 01:14:20.018
- You're gonna be fine.
- Come on, now.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.656
She's gonna be...

01:14:24.658 --> 01:14:27.058
Daddy!

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:30.228
Wake up, please!

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:33.165
Daddy!

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:35.804
Wake up!

01:15:20.247 --> 01:15:22.682
Australian Army!
We're gonna get you out!

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.253
Come on! Here! Go!

01:15:38.632 --> 01:15:41.866
Come on, guys! Get up!
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

01:15:41.868 --> 01:15:44.336
Go, go, go! Move out!
Go, go!

01:15:44.338 --> 01:15:47.339
Second Commandos,
anyone alive out there?

01:15:53.247 --> 01:15:57.383
I said, anyone alive out there?

01:15:57.385 --> 01:16:01.053
You guys okay?

01:16:01.055 --> 01:16:05.127
Do not move.
We'll come to you.

01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:09.197
Trackers are getting good, Az.

01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:16.102
What you got, mate?

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.836
- 11:00.
- 11:00.

01:16:17.838 --> 01:16:20.809
Two hundred meters, target
moving from left to right.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:32.250
What happened?
Bella, what happened?

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:34.219
Is she dead?
Is Vanessa dead?

01:16:34.221 --> 01:16:37.156
Do you have a medic?
Is there a medic?

01:16:37.158 --> 01:16:41.192
Is there a medic? It's the fucking army!
We need a fucking medic!

01:16:41.194 --> 01:16:44.964
Vanessa! Vanessa, no!

01:16:44.966 --> 01:16:47.369
Bella, what happened?!

01:16:51.271 --> 01:16:53.906
- No, no, no!
- Peter, look at me.

01:16:53.908 --> 01:16:56.211
What happened to her?

01:16:57.779 --> 01:17:00.079
She's not dead.
Please wake up.

01:17:00.081 --> 01:17:04.316
- She's gone.
- What do you mean she's gone?

01:17:13.427 --> 01:17:15.896
I'm so sorry.

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:27.042
Oh!

01:17:59.306 --> 01:18:03.679
You two, take these guys out.
Do that right now.

01:18:24.832 --> 01:18:26.766
Tinned peaches.

01:18:26.768 --> 01:18:28.299
For months now,

01:18:28.301 --> 01:18:31.070
all we've heard about is
a resistance in the forest.

01:18:31.072 --> 01:18:32.905
You kept us going.

01:18:32.907 --> 01:18:35.241
That's why we
came back out here.

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.446
You guys are heroes.

01:19:02.002 --> 01:19:05.773
He took a hit to the head.
Thank you.

01:19:20.587 --> 01:19:22.224
How is he?

01:19:29.963 --> 01:19:35.433
I found this just
before you found me.

01:19:35.435 --> 01:19:37.335
- They cultivated it.
- All right. Jesus, I'll just,

01:19:37.337 --> 01:19:39.541
I'll stick with my peaches.

01:19:43.109 --> 01:19:46.213
Do you know what's actually
going on out there?

01:20:04.131 --> 01:20:06.368
Well...

01:20:08.869 --> 01:20:11.903
All our cities are
either flooded or destroyed,

01:20:11.905 --> 01:20:15.473
something do with their ship being
too close to our atmosphere.

01:20:15.475 --> 01:20:19.413
Government leaders are gone,
everyone's in hiding.

01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:40.098
I don't know about all you guys,
but look, the army's here now.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:43.602
I've got to get out of here.
I've got to keep...

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.537
I've got to keep
searching for them.

01:20:46.539 --> 01:20:48.540
We're out of here, Bella.

01:20:48.542 --> 01:20:52.177
Dad, we can't leave.

01:20:52.179 --> 01:20:54.213
Pete?

01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:56.147
- Bella, we gotta...
- Peter.

01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:58.683
I will go back
to that factory with you,

01:20:58.685 --> 01:21:01.120
and we will finish this.

01:21:01.122 --> 01:21:05.193
But please, please,
can you stay?

01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:10.329
What factory?

01:21:10.331 --> 01:21:13.665
The factory's where they're
holding everyone from our town.

01:21:13.667 --> 01:21:16.335
I think we should see the CO.

01:21:16.337 --> 01:21:21.540
Recon elements indicate that the grays
have some kind of biological weapon.

01:21:21.542 --> 01:21:26.678
It's a toxin or pathogen obviously
designed to wipe us out once and for all.

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:30.382
We finally got confirmation it is
at this particular grid reference.

01:21:30.384 --> 01:21:34.986
- It's your town.
- That factory is one of the most strategic targets in this war.

01:21:34.988 --> 01:21:38.290
Now, our intel suggests that the
weapon's been moved to Sydney,

01:21:38.292 --> 01:21:41.626
so that's gonna be the focus
of our major attack. Davis.

01:21:41.628 --> 01:21:46.165
During the Sydney assault, we wanna
cause a distraction at the facility

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:51.135
and destroy any means to continue
manufacturing this virus.

01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:54.005
Now, your prison break plan
could be that distraction.

01:21:54.007 --> 01:21:56.642
Now, your team know the size,
the layout,

01:21:56.644 --> 01:21:59.178
the disposition of the enemy
there better than anyone else.

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:05.284
It would help the situation if you were
to assist Major Davis and his men.

01:22:05.286 --> 01:22:07.689
Our first priority
is to get our families out.

01:22:08.756 --> 01:22:10.488
Well, my priority

01:22:10.490 --> 01:22:13.459
is to save as many civilian
lives as is possible.

01:22:13.461 --> 01:22:17.729
And there are currently 500,000
innocent people living in Sydney.

01:22:17.731 --> 01:22:19.464
They're living like rats.

01:22:19.466 --> 01:22:23.102
We are moving against
the factory at 1400 hours.

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.137
If you're in,
you have our thanks.

01:22:25.139 --> 01:22:29.074
If not, then we understand.
The decision's yours.

01:22:29.076 --> 01:22:32.510
So this is it, everybody.
Months of planning

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:38.083
with every fighter, trooper, fucking
pilot, goddamn sapper we have left,

01:22:38.085 --> 01:22:40.785
and it all comes down to today.

01:22:40.787 --> 01:22:43.321
This day.

01:22:43.323 --> 01:22:47.459
No mistakes.
Let's make it count.

01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:52.367
Look after your people.
Good luck.

01:22:55.536 --> 01:22:59.705
She's a ball buster, no doubt. But
she got us through dark days.

01:22:59.707 --> 01:23:02.107
But listen, we're in a bit
of a rush here, okay?

01:23:02.109 --> 01:23:03.674
So if you're gonna join us,

01:23:03.676 --> 01:23:07.713
there's an orders group
in one hour at the motor pool.

01:23:07.715 --> 01:23:09.751
One hour.

01:23:11.217 --> 01:23:13.317
I like it. Let's do this.

01:23:13.319 --> 01:23:16.388
Not with your wing clipped,
old man.

01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:20.826
Jackson... where are you going?

01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:24.196
- I'm done.
- What?

01:23:24.198 --> 01:23:26.468
I'm done.

01:23:42.515 --> 01:23:45.219
There's something I have to do.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.153
I think you'd approve.

01:23:49.155 --> 01:23:52.726
God, I love you so much.

01:23:55.328 --> 01:23:58.265
Please find your way back.

01:24:18.685 --> 01:24:20.552
Nothing on TV tonight, huh?

01:24:20.554 --> 01:24:24.826
- Thought you might join us.
- No one else?

01:24:33.199 --> 01:24:36.567
Turns out, we're all
with you till the end.

01:24:36.569 --> 01:24:38.870
What do you
think you're doing?

01:24:38.872 --> 01:24:40.772
- Coming with.
- I don't think so.

01:24:40.774 --> 01:24:43.442
He's a fighter.
He saved my ass.

01:24:43.444 --> 01:24:45.680
We're all in this together.

01:24:46.846 --> 01:24:48.780
All right.

01:24:48.782 --> 01:24:50.848
- What's the plan?
- Cause a distraction,

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:53.818
break your people out,
and save the fucking planet.

01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.155
That's the plan.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:58.891
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

01:25:14.207 --> 01:25:17.209
Hope you guys
are sure about this.

01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:20.245
It's everything we got left.

01:25:20.247 --> 01:25:22.450
That's my family.

01:25:36.564 --> 01:25:39.234
Two minutes!
Everyone sharpen up!

01:25:45.206 --> 01:25:47.708
- Ready to deploy, men?
- Copy that.

01:26:02.288 --> 01:26:04.725
Armor-piercing rounds!

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:18.704
Listen up. There's a lot more
of them. Intel is off.

01:26:18.706 --> 01:26:20.004
Az, patch me
through to the colonel.

01:26:20.006 --> 01:26:22.876
I know a vantage point.
Left up here.

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:42.727
Okay. It's a straight run through
the crops to the facility.

01:26:42.729 --> 01:26:45.030
On foot, 40 minutes.

01:26:45.032 --> 01:26:49.433
They're our people.
Amelia, that's right, isn't it?

01:26:49.435 --> 01:26:51.669
I think so.

01:26:51.671 --> 01:26:53.871
Can I borrow those?

01:26:53.873 --> 01:26:57.509
Be careful.
I got them for Father's Day.

01:26:57.511 --> 01:26:58.977
- You have kids?
- Not anymore.

01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:02.848
- Dave-o? I've lost comms.
- Keep trying.

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.819
Look.

01:27:12.826 --> 01:27:14.761
Ah!

01:27:16.997 --> 01:27:21.066
- That's a commander.
- Commander?

01:27:21.068 --> 01:27:22.534
Yeah, tough sons of bitches.

01:27:22.536 --> 01:27:23.968
Yeah, I barely
got away from one.

01:27:23.970 --> 01:27:25.803
- We need to get them out.
- You heard the colonel.

01:27:25.805 --> 01:27:27.406
There are bigger things
at stake here.

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:29.607
Look, there they are.
That's them. My family.

01:27:29.609 --> 01:27:30.844
Bella!

01:27:40.787 --> 01:27:43.854
- We're staying.
- Okay.

01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:46.058
Something doesn't
feel right here. Az.

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:49.061
- Yeah.
- Get the boys out and on rec-y.

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:51.766
I wanna know what
we're up against.

01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:01.639
Grays moving
into sector 545.

01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:04.976
Cag reports the enemy air strength
is much higher than anticipated.

01:28:04.978 --> 01:28:10.014
And the boys are taking a hell of a
beating over the skies of Sydney.

01:28:10.016 --> 01:28:12.983
- What are your numbers?
- Unknown. At 1345, Major Davis

01:28:12.985 --> 01:28:15.986
reported the grays are fortifying
all along these lines.

01:28:15.988 --> 01:28:19.924
When was the last report by Davis
before we lost radio contact?

01:28:19.926 --> 01:28:23.363
Same as everyone else,
ma'am, about 30 minutes.

01:28:27.801 --> 01:28:30.067
I think it's
a goddamn trap.

01:28:30.069 --> 01:28:32.937
- Colonel!
- This is a restricted area. You cannot be in here.

01:28:32.939 --> 01:28:35.773
Colonel, what's happening?
Colonel, what about my friends?

01:28:35.775 --> 01:28:40.347
The attack has suffered major losses.
There's no sign of the bio weapon.

01:28:42.048 --> 01:28:44.786
The virus was never moved.

01:28:45.886 --> 01:28:47.085
It's still in your town.

01:28:47.087 --> 01:28:49.086
What are you gonna do?

01:28:49.088 --> 01:28:54.025
Well, sending what's left of my
men would be a suicide mission.

01:28:54.027 --> 01:28:57.398
Your friends
are on their own.

01:29:03.002 --> 01:29:05.169
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
I need to wake him up.

01:29:05.171 --> 01:29:07.472
He's off the machines
and breathing normally.

01:29:07.474 --> 01:29:08.706
- It's just a matter of time.
- No, no, no.

01:29:08.708 --> 01:29:10.808
Sorry.

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:13.644
Matt! Come on, Matt. I need
you to wake up, all right?

01:29:13.646 --> 01:29:15.946
Get up. Matt, get up.
Come on!

01:29:15.948 --> 01:29:18.083
Matt, come on!
I need you to wake up, buddy!

01:29:18.085 --> 01:29:20.922
All right. Come on!
Wake up!

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:31.495
Matt! Matt.
Get up, get up, mate, come on.

01:29:31.497 --> 01:29:35.166
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at me. Matt.

01:29:35.168 --> 01:29:37.869
Marcus and Amelia
are all gonna die

01:29:37.871 --> 01:29:39.204
unless we do
something right now.

01:29:45.645 --> 01:29:47.978
- Where are they?
- They're in town.

01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:51.049
- The factory. Come on.
- Where the hell are we?

01:29:51.051 --> 01:29:53.621
We're in a military camp.

01:29:58.759 --> 01:30:01.863
- Get us a car.
- All right.

01:30:09.069 --> 01:30:14.071
<i>♪ From glen to glen
and down the mountainside ♪</i>

01:30:14.073 --> 01:30:16.942
Can I trust you
with her, mate?

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:19.544
Where do you think
you're going?

01:30:19.546 --> 01:30:21.946
I'm going out.

01:30:21.948 --> 01:30:24.549
I'm not letting
you go alone.

01:30:24.551 --> 01:30:26.785
This is the most important
thing I can ask of you, mate.

01:30:26.787 --> 01:30:28.586
- Please?
- Yeah.

01:30:28.588 --> 01:30:30.488
No, it's okay. Come on.

01:30:30.490 --> 01:30:33.493
Daddy's gotta go away
for a little while, okay?

01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:36.864
Here you go, mate.

01:30:42.636 --> 01:30:44.936
There we go.

01:30:44.938 --> 01:30:47.175
He'll be back soon.

01:30:54.581 --> 01:30:58.549
- What the hell is this?
- What? Think you can do better?

01:30:58.551 --> 01:31:01.753
Let's go.

01:31:01.755 --> 01:31:05.723
- Roomy.
- Yeah. Well, how about a little bit of gratitude, huh?

01:31:05.725 --> 01:31:08.159
- Thank you.
- You all good over there?

01:31:08.161 --> 01:31:10.898
- I'm fine. Let's just go.
- Seat belt.

01:31:30.082 --> 01:31:31.883
<i>Davis,
we've got eyes on you now.</i>

01:31:31.885 --> 01:31:34.818
- <i>Targets are clear to engage.</i>
- Roger that.

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:39.126
We're set.
Engage targets when ready.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.870
Well, this is nuts.

01:31:52.872 --> 01:31:55.072
Yeah.
Thanks for waking me up.

01:31:55.074 --> 01:31:59.777
Bioweapon's in the factory,
detonator doesn't have much range.

01:31:59.779 --> 01:32:02.750
No idea
of the welcoming party.

01:32:03.884 --> 01:32:06.585
Hey, you listening?

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:11.956
Bioweapon's in the factory, the detonator has
short range and a possible welcoming party.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:14.694
And it's just
the two of us.

01:32:15.828 --> 01:32:17.731
At least they
won't expect it.

01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:21.601
You got your helmet?

01:32:23.636 --> 01:32:25.105
Dick.

01:32:32.679 --> 01:32:34.345
It's okay.

01:32:49.128 --> 01:32:50.730
Jesus.

01:32:56.302 --> 01:32:58.573
They found us.

01:33:01.975 --> 01:33:03.744
Take cover!

01:33:04.810 --> 01:33:07.113
Move! Move!

01:33:20.926 --> 01:33:23.163
Let's do this.

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:33.007
Okay. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.

01:34:40.039 --> 01:34:42.906
- Amelia.
- Matt, Matt, Matt, come on.

01:34:42.908 --> 01:34:45.910
There's no time, all right?
We gotta go. Look at me.

01:34:45.912 --> 01:34:47.682
Come on.

01:35:02.762 --> 01:35:06.531
Hey, Tin Man.

01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:16.176
Take that one. I got this.

01:35:30.457 --> 01:35:32.055
Nothing's working.

01:35:32.057 --> 01:35:34.261
Screw it!

01:35:37.564 --> 01:35:39.164
Jackson!

01:35:39.166 --> 01:35:41.802
Set the explosives, be careful!

01:35:43.103 --> 01:35:45.068
All right.
You're free, let's go.

01:35:45.070 --> 01:35:47.171
We're blowing the building,
get the hell out!

01:35:47.173 --> 01:35:50.275
Henderson's farm, move.

01:35:50.277 --> 01:35:52.009
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:35:52.011 --> 01:35:53.945
Take it easy, take it easy,
look after each other.

01:35:53.947 --> 01:35:55.513
- Helen, are you all right?
- Matt, you're alive.

01:35:55.515 --> 01:35:57.447
Big fella,
come here, come here.

01:35:57.449 --> 01:35:59.317
Stay with her,
and keep your heads down.

01:35:59.319 --> 01:36:00.821
Henderson's farm, go.

01:36:32.586 --> 01:36:34.221
Shit.

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:33.547
I should have worn a helmet.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.285
I need you to cover me.

01:37:41.287 --> 01:37:44.022
You're going alone.
You don't want help.

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:46.057
Not this time.

01:37:46.059 --> 01:37:49.329
Cover fire!

01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:56.934
Here. You want this, huh?

01:37:56.936 --> 01:37:59.073
Come get it.

01:38:03.409 --> 01:38:04.709
Rookie.

01:38:04.711 --> 01:38:07.081
Enough.

01:38:08.381 --> 01:38:11.382
- Hand it to me.
- English, huh?

01:38:11.384 --> 01:38:14.152
Well done. That was sarcasm.

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.254
You haven't learnt that yet,
haven't you?

01:38:16.256 --> 01:38:17.988
We have learned many things.

01:38:17.990 --> 01:38:21.159
The universe
grows smaller every day.

01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:22.962
Good for you.

01:38:24.497 --> 01:38:26.563
Uh-uh!

01:38:26.565 --> 01:38:31.137
You shoot me, I smash this,
and you start again.

01:38:37.277 --> 01:38:39.544
Learned we want you gone yet?

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.981
You understand nothing.

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:46.284
You have no power
and we have no choice.

01:38:46.286 --> 01:38:48.922
There's always a choice.

01:38:50.356 --> 01:38:54.094
I've seen your world,
what's left of it.

01:38:55.161 --> 01:38:57.294
Humans.

01:38:57.296 --> 01:39:01.665
You cling to a planet
you insist on destroying.

01:39:01.667 --> 01:39:03.768
We learned from our mistakes.

01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:08.339
Our world is gone.
We need this one.

01:39:08.341 --> 01:39:11.709
If we must kill to survive,
we will.

01:39:11.711 --> 01:39:15.682
- Not today.
- Humans!

01:39:33.399 --> 01:39:36.302
<i>Comms back up. Get
those choppers over there now!</i>

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:42.242
Peter!

01:39:46.746 --> 01:39:49.379
Ah!

01:39:49.381 --> 01:39:50.415
Go get your family, Pete.

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:51.715
I'm not leaving you.

01:39:51.717 --> 01:39:54.253
- Come on.
- Ah!

01:40:02.761 --> 01:40:04.428
Peter, get down!

01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:14.772
Colonel's sending air support!
Tigers are inbound now!

01:40:14.774 --> 01:40:20.547
Demon call sign, this is 91-Charlie.
Fire mission, over. Hot smoke!

01:40:22.849 --> 01:40:25.083
We see your call sign,
send, over.

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:28.285
Fire mission, call sign
is in the center

01:40:28.287 --> 01:40:30.854
of the cleared field in craters.
Danger close, over!

01:40:30.856 --> 01:40:34.459
Roger that. Danger close.
Keep your heads down. Over.

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:37.431
Take cover!

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:57.778
Come on!

01:42:19.599 --> 01:42:23.470
Yo!

01:42:44.724 --> 01:42:47.825
Shit.

01:42:47.827 --> 01:42:51.562
<i>91-Charlie, we see you have a
large alien force coming from the west.</i>

01:42:51.564 --> 01:42:54.632
- Come in. Come in, this is Matt Simmons.
- <i>Over.</i>

01:42:54.634 --> 01:42:57.835
I'm in the factory, I have the weapon.
Is anyone out there?

01:42:57.837 --> 01:43:02.673
<i>Repeat, this is Matt Simmons,
I have the weapon.</i>

01:43:02.675 --> 01:43:07.777
<i>We're in the factory, our escape
is blocked. Can anyone hear me?</i>

01:43:07.779 --> 01:43:10.615
- Matty?
- Amelia?

01:43:10.617 --> 01:43:14.652
Oh, baby,
it's so good to hear your voice.

01:43:14.654 --> 01:43:18.488
Okay, listen, I have the weapon,
I'm in the factory.

01:43:18.490 --> 01:43:21.826
- I could stop them.
- No.

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:23.861
No, Matt, you put that down.

01:43:23.863 --> 01:43:26.397
You put it down
and you get out of there.

01:43:26.399 --> 01:43:28.936
Wait, just... listen.

01:43:30.403 --> 01:43:32.602
Your mom is at Henderson's farm.

01:43:32.604 --> 01:43:35.473
Matt!

01:43:35.475 --> 01:43:37.974
I love you!

01:43:37.976 --> 01:43:40.378
<i>I love you!</i>

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.013
- <i>Matt!</i>
- <i>I love you.</i>

01:43:44.884 --> 01:43:45.883
Shit.

01:43:45.885 --> 01:43:48.454
Matt!

01:44:05.537 --> 01:44:08.505
You cannot kill all of us.

01:44:08.507 --> 01:44:10.907
You cannot escape.

01:44:10.909 --> 01:44:13.076
Let us finish this now.

01:44:13.078 --> 01:44:17.080
What? And ruin
this great conversation?

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:29.695
Jackson!

01:44:43.676 --> 01:44:46.477
Shit.

01:44:46.479 --> 01:44:48.879
- Just go.
- Trying to take the glory again?

01:44:50.582 --> 01:44:51.982
Vanessa needs you.

01:44:51.984 --> 01:44:54.954
Vanessa is dead, man. Go.

01:44:58.123 --> 01:45:00.891
See you soon, mate.

01:45:00.893 --> 01:45:03.059
You take care of
my little girl, Matt, okay?

01:45:03.061 --> 01:45:06.863
You take care of Allison,
you hear me?

01:45:06.865 --> 01:45:11.371
Matt, you hear me?
You take care of Allison, okay?

01:45:16.542 --> 01:45:18.679
Move. Move.

01:45:31.591 --> 01:45:33.827
Take care of my little girl!

01:45:34.926 --> 01:45:36.595
You take care of her!

01:46:12.698 --> 01:46:16.936
Something is up!
Let's take them down!

01:46:19.439 --> 01:46:21.775
Put your weapons down.

01:46:23.176 --> 01:46:26.012
Put them down!

01:46:33.819 --> 01:46:35.518
Jenny! Samuel!

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.456
Dad!

01:46:44.997 --> 01:46:48.568
Oh!

01:46:53.872 --> 01:46:56.009
How are you doing?

01:47:38.783 --> 01:47:41.684
- <i>Outstanding work.</i>
- <i>Thank you, colonel.</i>

01:47:41.686 --> 01:47:44.120
<i>The, uh, Sydney operation
also broke through in the end,</i>

01:47:44.122 --> 01:47:48.194
so, yeah,
we're starting to push back.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.982
Matt?

01:48:45.717 --> 01:48:48.251
Hey.

01:48:48.253 --> 01:48:50.524
Where's Jacko?

01:49:07.672 --> 01:49:09.842
What now?

01:49:21.854 --> 01:49:24.791
There's not many
of their species left.

01:49:27.693 --> 01:49:31.797
They came here because it was
their last chance to survive.

01:49:40.338 --> 01:49:44.010
- Amelia.
- Davis.

01:49:46.078 --> 01:49:49.245
Can I have your knife, please?

01:49:49.247 --> 01:49:51.283
Trust me.

01:50:08.434 --> 01:50:11.237
You have nothing left here.

01:50:13.972 --> 01:50:16.141
But you can.

01:50:18.043 --> 01:50:21.711
Will you help us?

01:50:21.713 --> 01:50:25.915
Will you help us
stop this war,

01:50:25.917 --> 01:50:28.220
and share this world?

01:50:35.961 --> 01:50:38.896
Do you understand me?

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:41.400
Am I wasting my time?

01:52:26.137 --> 01:52:28.004
<i>The war is changing now.</i>

01:52:28.006 --> 01:52:29.973
<i>There are still
rogue alien units</i>

01:52:29.975 --> 01:52:32.009
<i>who don't want to join us,</i>

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:36.213
<i>but we've got inside
information and ideas.</i>

01:52:36.215 --> 01:52:38.581
<i>The galaxy just
became a much smaller place,</i>

01:52:38.583 --> 01:52:41.951
<i>but I know the only way
to see this through</i>

01:52:41.953 --> 01:52:44.821
<i>is for everyone
to work together.</i>

01:52:44.823 --> 01:52:48.761
Go! Go! Go!

01:52:55.134 --> 01:52:56.567
<i>We'll push on.</i>

01:52:56.569 --> 01:53:00.970
<i>We'll pull through.
We'll survive.</i>

01:53:00.972 --> 01:53:03.042
<i>We'll keep fighting.</i>

01:53:04.475 --> 01:53:07.179
<i>And I know we'll be victorious.</i>
