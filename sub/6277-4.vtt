Well, you never knew
what you were gonna get.

38:11.667 --> 38:14.208
Who are they?

38:14.208 --> 38:18.500
They're ex-girlfriends.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.709
What was Frances like?

38:21.709 --> 38:25.250
She was nothing like you.

38:25.250 --> 38:28.458
I bet she couldn't
suck dick like I can.

38:34.291 --> 38:38.250
[music plays in background]

38:38.250 --> 38:40.250
Jesus, kid,
what happened in there?

38:40.250 --> 38:42.083
Did she swallow it whole?

38:42.083 --> 38:44.959
- Fucking asshole!
- Hey!

38:44.959 --> 38:46.792
Ladies, that's it.
The party's over.

38:46.792 --> 38:47.917
Get your stuff.
We're out of here.

38:47.917 --> 38:50.041
Somebody get her.

38:50.041 --> 38:51.250
[music stops]

38:53.291 --> 38:56.041
Look, I know why
you've been upset with me.

38:56.041 --> 38:57.792
I did a terrible thing
to you.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.959
Shouldn't have let you
take all that heat.

38:59.959 --> 39:03.125
No, no, but you did,

39:03.125 --> 39:05.959
because that's who you are.

39:05.959 --> 39:09.000
And then you come round here
with a bottle of champagne,

39:09.000 --> 39:13.166
and you want me to tell you
everything is fine.

39:13.166 --> 39:16.458
Well, it ain't.

39:16.458 --> 39:18.458
Things are gonna get better.

39:18.458 --> 39:19.875
You just got to trust it.

39:19.875 --> 39:22.291
No, it's not, Mick.

39:22.291 --> 39:24.333
You know, for me,

39:24.333 --> 39:28.291
it's gonna get
a lot worse.

39:28.291 --> 39:32.041
And you're going
to stick around for that?

39:32.041 --> 39:36.125
You know, I started
that business for you kids.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.667
I want to leave a legacy.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.250
Whores and coke?

39:40.250 --> 39:42.166
Yeah,

39:42.166 --> 39:44.500
and when the shakes
get real bad,

39:44.500 --> 39:47.083
I promise not to go anywhere.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.875
[breathing heavily]

40:13.834 --> 40:17.208
God, I got these fucking braces
'cause I thought

40:17.208 --> 40:19.667
they'd help the headaches,
but they...

40:19.667 --> 40:21.583
only make it worse.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.750
There's a surgery,
but I just haven't had any time.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.375
[labored breathing]

40:35.917 --> 40:40.709
You do know why my dad
hired you, Ray?

40:40.709 --> 40:43.709
No.

40:43.709 --> 40:46.792
Because he doesn't want to
have to face the fucking things

40:46.792 --> 40:48.542
he's done.

40:52.291 --> 40:53.291
[door opens]

40:53.291 --> 40:55.417
It's time.

40:55.417 --> 40:57.542
We should convene
in the conference room.

41:01.250 --> 41:03.291
[groans]

41:11.208 --> 41:14.291
Mr. Finney asked
that you be there as well.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.458
[phone rings in distance]

41:43.458 --> 41:45.417
- Hi, everybody.
- I have a pitch.

41:45.417 --> 41:46.792
- Cambodia.
- Casey--

41:46.792 --> 41:49.125
A swift boat skims
across the Saigon River,

41:49.125 --> 41:51.375
Tony the Tiger at the helm.

41:51.375 --> 41:52.250
- Casey--
- Dad, I have one for him,

41:52.250 --> 41:53.667
Trix the Rabbit,
Captain Crunch--

41:53.667 --> 41:55.709
Casey, Casey,
I'm not selling the studio.

41:55.709 --> 41:57.250
- Yes!
- What?

41:57.250 --> 41:58.792
I have been on the phone

41:58.792 --> 42:00.959
for the past six months
with investment bankers,

42:00.959 --> 42:02.667
and I have been traveling
back and forth from Shanghai.

42:02.667 --> 42:04.375
What are you talking about?

42:04.375 --> 42:06.000
[Finney] Sorry,
I've made up my mind.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.291
You're gonna have to tell
Mr. Liu the studio's

42:07.291 --> 42:09.458
off the table.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.542
Well, I need to
talk to you first.

42:14.417 --> 42:16.667
Now.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.542
Fucking A.

42:25.291 --> 42:26.458
Wait, wait, wait.

42:26.458 --> 42:27.667
Do you think
we can get Tommy Wheeler

42:27.667 --> 42:29.458
to play Captain Crunch?

42:29.458 --> 42:32.291
I mean, it's got to be worth
a GLAAD award, right?

42:32.291 --> 42:35.500
Right, Ray?
Huh?

42:52.417 --> 42:54.000
No, you listen.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.458
[whispers] Tell him to enjoy
his New York whores.

42:56.458 --> 42:58.291
Yeah, and I hope
your New York whores

42:58.291 --> 43:01.333
enjoy your disease-ridden dick.

43:01.333 --> 43:02.667
[sighs]

43:04.709 --> 43:07.542
I really, really liked him.

43:07.542 --> 43:10.000
Why was he such an asshole?

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
He was such an asshole.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.959
Sweetheart,
come here.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.041
Oh. Yeah.

43:17.041 --> 43:18.208
[door opens]

43:18.208 --> 43:20.041
[Margaret]
Hello?

43:20.041 --> 43:21.542
Don't say anything.

43:21.542 --> 43:23.542
- [door closes]
- I won't, I promise.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.041
Thought you had a flight.

43:33.041 --> 43:36.875
I missed it.

43:36.875 --> 43:39.750
[Margaret] So you got
my daughter drunk instead?

43:39.750 --> 43:41.500
She was supposed
to turn in her paper.

43:41.500 --> 43:43.083
[Abby]
So what?

43:43.083 --> 43:46.166
She doesn't have
to be a fucking bookkeeper.

43:46.166 --> 43:49.291
No, she doesn't.

43:49.291 --> 43:50.417
But I don't want her
depending on a man

43:50.417 --> 43:52.500
the rest of her life either.

44:04.917 --> 44:07.583
[crying]

44:10.500 --> 44:12.291
Why don't you stay a few days?

44:16.917 --> 44:19.250
Maybe it'd be good
for the both of us.

44:22.750 --> 44:24.667
Look at how tired you are.

44:32.291 --> 44:34.250
Let me take care of you.

44:34.250 --> 44:35.667
Come on.

44:35.667 --> 44:37.166
You can have
your old room back.

44:37.166 --> 44:38.959
[tearful laugh]

44:38.959 --> 44:40.291
[sniffles]

44:45.458 --> 44:46.500
[sighs]

44:49.125 --> 44:51.959
I need you one more minute.

44:54.333 --> 44:56.125
Bring Mr. Liu
to the conference room.

44:56.125 --> 44:57.792
We're selling.

44:57.792 --> 44:59.166
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I heard Paige out.

44:59.166 --> 45:00.458
I see where this is going.

45:00.458 --> 45:02.458
[Varick]
I'll get him.

45:02.458 --> 45:04.208
You shut the door, Ray?

45:10.000 --> 45:11.667
A good family business

45:11.667 --> 45:15.166
is not the same thing
as a good family, Mr. Donovan.

45:20.250 --> 45:22.875
Paige has a plan

45:22.875 --> 45:25.083
to use the proceeds
from the sale of the studio

45:25.083 --> 45:27.542
to bring an NFL team
to Los Angeles

45:27.542 --> 45:32.125
and build the grandest stadium
ever imagined.

45:32.125 --> 45:33.500
What do you want?

45:33.500 --> 45:36.000
Oh, she no longer
sees me as her father.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.500
She sees me as an opponent,

45:37.500 --> 45:40.291
something in the way
of her ascension.

45:40.291 --> 45:41.417
Can you imagine that?

45:41.417 --> 45:43.625
No.

45:43.625 --> 45:45.250
That's why,
from this point on,

45:45.250 --> 45:48.166
this things
get more complicated,

45:48.166 --> 45:50.542
remember that.

45:50.542 --> 45:55.041
Remember that you work
only for me.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.375
[knock at door]

45:59.375 --> 46:00.375
Hmm?

46:00.375 --> 46:02.750
He's here.

46:06.250 --> 46:07.875
Ahh.

46:35.709 --> 46:37.917
I'm sorry I put my name
on your office.

46:41.291 --> 46:44.959
You want me
to take it down?

46:44.959 --> 46:46.375
What?

46:46.375 --> 46:49.250
I can leave.

46:49.250 --> 46:52.792
Stay at Pop's.

46:52.792 --> 46:56.959
No, you...you take the bed.

46:59.333 --> 47:01.458
I don't sleep anymore
anyway.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.625
Where were you?

47:25.625 --> 47:28.041
Work.

47:28.041 --> 47:30.291
Conor skipped school today.

47:30.291 --> 47:31.709
Not that you care.

47:31.709 --> 47:33.041
[sighs]

47:33.041 --> 47:36.291
Yeah, well, your mother
should have been here.

47:36.291 --> 47:40.750
- Are you getting a divorce?
- I don't know.

47:40.750 --> 47:42.291
Are you in love
with someone else?

47:42.291 --> 47:43.959
No.

47:43.959 --> 47:47.792
Look, you don't have
to babysit us.

47:47.792 --> 47:49.875
If you're happier gone,
you should just get in your car

47:49.875 --> 47:52.875
and go to your apartment.

47:52.875 --> 47:53.959
Hey.

47:56.291 --> 47:59.333
Come here.

47:59.333 --> 48:00.709
No.

48:14.834 --> 48:16.333
Remember when we used
to choreograph

48:16.333 --> 48:19.000
dance sequences
to Like a Virgin  in here?

48:21.834 --> 48:24.166
I remember sneaking
out the window.

48:37.750 --> 48:39.917
He's a dangerous
fucking guy.

48:43.875 --> 48:47.542
But you don't have
to stay with him.

48:47.542 --> 48:51.041
You can change things whenever
the fuck you want, Abby.

49:04.166 --> 49:07.041
Get some sleep.

49:14.875 --> 49:18.208
It'll all look better
in the morning.
