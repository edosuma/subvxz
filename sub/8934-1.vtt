00:01.835 --> 00:02.402
This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:03.903
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.903 --> 00:06.006
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.941 --> 00:10.610
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.245
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.513 --> 00:15.749
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.649 --> 00:17.684
Yikes!

00:18.418 --> 00:20.020
Yaaaah...

00:22.589 --> 00:23.857
Yeaaaah!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.760
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.267 --> 00:36.469
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.171 --> 00:39.472
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.309 --> 00:45.378
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.446 --> 00:47.480
the Raccoons!!

00:47.480 --> 00:49.983
♪ (show theme music) ♪

00:59.692 --> 01:02.295
Just about everyone
has a secret dream

01:02.295 --> 01:03.997
and Schaeffer is no different.

01:03.997 --> 01:06.533
Schaeffer's dream of
running a small Cafe

01:06.533 --> 01:08.435
is almost a reality.

01:08.435 --> 01:10.937
Of course there are a few
details to attend to,

01:10.937 --> 01:13.473
before the Blue Spruce
Cafe opens its doors.

01:16.176 --> 01:19.279
A very
nice audition, thanks,

01:19.279 --> 01:21.748
but I'm afraid we're
looking for something a bit...

01:21.748 --> 01:24.384
different for opening night.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.452
Well, Schaeffer?

01:25.452 --> 01:27.187
Do you like any of the
acts you've auditioned?

01:27.187 --> 01:28.822
Not so far.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.523
But there's
one still to go.

01:30.523 --> 01:33.226
You must have seen
twenty acts today, Schaeffer.

01:33.226 --> 01:35.028
You'll have to decide soon.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.596
You open tomorrow night.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.766
I kinda liked
the Fire Eater myself.

01:41.568 --> 01:43.736
Pig 2: Ahem. Preee-senting.

01:43.736 --> 01:47.941
The Tremendous Trotters.

01:49.242 --> 01:52.879
I see you've been saving the
best act until last, Schaeffer.

01:52.879 --> 01:55.815
Hi-hi! This should be dandy.

01:55.815 --> 02:00.053
Uh! Uuuuh-uh!

02:00.053 --> 02:02.555
The Fire Eater's
looking better all the time.

02:02.555 --> 02:05.291
Aaahh. Yikes.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.093
Oohh. Aaah. Oooh.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.294
Oh-oh!

02:08.294 --> 02:10.563
Aaah-ooh. Eee. Yip.

02:10.563 --> 02:13.766
Aaaaah!

02:13.766 --> 02:16.102
Pig 1: Well?

02:16.102 --> 02:17.270
Are we in?

02:17.270 --> 02:19.405
You guys
will bowl them over.

02:19.405 --> 02:23.409
Sorry boys, it's not
quite what I'm.. looking for.

02:23.409 --> 02:26.279
Pig 3: Humph.
Everyone's a critic.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.647
Hmmm.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.983
I'll help you with those
in a minute, Cedric.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.018
You've got
enough to do, Schaeffer.

02:32.018 --> 02:33.586
I can handle it.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.489
Sorry,
we're not open yet.

02:36.489 --> 02:38.825
I'm here
for the auditions.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.293
The name's Hill Bailey.

02:40.293 --> 02:42.262
Hill Bailey??

02:42.262 --> 02:44.164
Your name's not Hill Bailey.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.232
What's the
matter with you guys?

02:46.232 --> 02:49.969
Don't you recognize the world's
greatest guitar player?

02:49.969 --> 02:52.338
This is Woodchuck Berry!

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
Wow!
Woodchuck Berry, the greatest

02:59.012 --> 03:01.214
guitar player in the world.

03:01.214 --> 03:03.383
Live, at the Blue Spruce Cafe.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.451
You know, I've
heard all your albums.

03:05.451 --> 03:07.820
My Pop's one of
your biggest fans.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.424
And Cedric and I can play
every single one of your songs.

03:11.424 --> 03:13.927
Well, maybe you
could back me up on a tune.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.495
Wha.. you're kidding??

03:15.495 --> 03:19.299
We're going to play
backup for Woodchuck
Berry?!

03:19.299 --> 03:22.802
Wow. Or is it.. Hill Bailey?

03:22.802 --> 03:24.737
Usually,
it's Hill Bailey

03:24.737 --> 03:26.806
but seeing as the secret's out,

03:26.806 --> 03:29.075
aw, you might as
well call me Woody.

03:29.075 --> 03:32.912
Great.
But why Hill Bailey?

03:32.912 --> 03:35.815
Are you traveling
incognito, or something?

03:35.815 --> 03:37.750
Yeah, I guess,
you could say that.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.353
It just got so's I couldn't play
a little place like this,

03:40.353 --> 03:42.088
without old fans crowding me,

03:42.088 --> 03:43.690
reporters wanting interviews.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.258
You know, how it is...

03:45.258 --> 03:48.328
Well, seeing as I am going
to be here a couple days,

03:48.328 --> 03:50.263
I might as well set up camp.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.869
I don't know, Cedric.

03:56.869 --> 04:00.240
There's something a little
funny about a big star

04:00.240 --> 04:03.943
like Woodchuck Berry,
using another name.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.881
Pig 3: Oh, oh, oh, I think
we've got it this time.

04:08.881 --> 04:14.354
Wooo aahh, eee, yipe.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.223
Uh-aaaaaah!

04:17.223 --> 04:20.560
Pig 1: Well, that's the
last of the boss's dishes.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.631
Let's fact it boys,
we've got no talent.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.367
Pig 2: And you said, show biz
would be our ticket

04:27.367 --> 04:29.269
to the big bucks. Humph.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.572
We'll never manage to
break into the big time.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.374
Pig 1: That's it. We'll manage.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.509
We'll find somebody with talent,

04:36.509 --> 04:37.777
and manage them.

04:37.777 --> 04:41.748
They'll do the work and
we'll rake in the profits.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.082
Pig 3: Aoo.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.585
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.954
But, uh, who will we manage?

04:47.954 --> 04:52.792
Pig 2: How about the greatest
guitar player in the world?

04:54.527 --> 04:57.664
That's right.
Send over a complete set.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.332
I don't care what
they look like,

04:59.332 --> 05:01.267
as long as they're cheap.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.502
Busy, Pop?

05:02.502 --> 05:04.437
Just
ordering more dishes.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.306
I can't find a
plate in the house.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.974
What's on your mind, son?

05:07.974 --> 05:11.477
Guess who's opening the
Blue Spruce Cafe tomorrow night?

05:11.477 --> 05:13.513
Whoever's go
they key, I suppose.

05:13.513 --> 05:15.948
That was funny.
Write it down.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.384
Your all-time
favorite musician...

05:18.384 --> 05:19.919
Woodchuck Berry.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.322
Ugh...

05:22.322 --> 05:23.489
And guess what?

05:23.489 --> 05:26.859
He's asked the gang to back
him up on one of his songs.

05:26.859 --> 05:29.028
Well, gotta run, see ya, Pop.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.705
Old Woodchuck Berry, eh?

05:40.340 --> 05:43.476
Boy, playing the Blue
Spruce Cafe must be

05:43.476 --> 05:46.446
a lot different from
those mega-concerts

05:46.446 --> 05:48.247
you played twenty years ago.

05:48.247 --> 05:51.050
Yeah.
Those were good times.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.353
I remember playing Woodlot...

05:53.353 --> 05:55.455
all the big names were there...

05:55.455 --> 05:57.890
Paul Butterfly, Canned Meat,

05:57.890 --> 05:59.359
Arlo Guppy...

05:59.359 --> 06:02.929
Yeah. Giants...
Every one of 'em.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.997
Don't you miss
those days, Woody?

06:04.997 --> 06:06.899
You can't
live in the past, Bert.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.335
Times change. People change.

06:09.335 --> 06:24.851
♪ (guitar music playing) ♪

06:24.851 --> 06:26.519
It's so sad, Schaeffer.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.255
Poor Woody misses the big time.

06:30.323 --> 06:33.092
Pig 1: Shh. Here he comes.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.294
Now remember. We're fans.

06:35.294 --> 06:39.532
Oh Mr. Berry. Mr. Berry.

06:39.532 --> 06:42.502
Pig 2: We're thrilled
to meet you. Ho hoho.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.605
Pig 3: We're your biggest fans.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.775
Pig 1: Would you sign one
of your albums for us?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.743
Be happy to, boys.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.712
Pig 1: Just sign right here.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.617
I hope I see
you fellas at the show.

06:58.484 --> 07:01.387
Oh, we wouldn't miss it.

07:01.387 --> 07:04.690
Pig 1: We got it!
Woodchuck Berry just signed

07:04.690 --> 07:09.195
an exclusive contract with
Three Pigs Management.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.802
There's gotta be a reason.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.372
Why would Woodchuck Berry want
to play in a little Cafe

07:19.372 --> 07:21.374
under the name of Hill Bailey?

07:21.374 --> 07:23.609
He already
told you why.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.513
He's trying to avoid
big crowds and publicity.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.615
Aw, there's
got to be more to it...

07:29.615 --> 07:30.917
Hey, wait a minute.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.754
Listen to this.
It's from 15 years ago.

07:34.754 --> 07:37.857
Woodchuck Berry'S
World Tour canceled.

07:37.857 --> 07:41.594
So? He dropped
out of sight,

07:41.594 --> 07:43.830
right after they
canceled his tour.

07:43.830 --> 07:47.099
Gosh, it must have
just shattered him.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.134
Hey, Cedric.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.802
Schaeffer said,
I'd find you here.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.638
Huh? Oh. Heh heh.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.907
Woody, hi.

07:54.907 --> 07:56.742
Hi, Bert.
Listen Cedric,

07:56.742 --> 07:59.579
Schaeffer tells me,
you're Cyril Sneer's son.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.514
Sure. That's my Pop.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.815
Do you know him?

08:02.815 --> 08:05.251
Are you
kidding? We go way back.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.953
I would love to see him again.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.489
Well, c'mon. I'll take
you up to the house right now.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.723
See you later, Bert.

08:10.723 --> 08:13.192
You know my Pop?
Amazing.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.363
Woodchuck Berry,
deserves to be back on top.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.199
And who better to
put him there than,

08:20.199 --> 08:23.636
Bert Raccoon.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.605
Pig 1: Rico, Rico, Rico...

08:25.605 --> 08:27.473
I'm talking big time here.

08:27.473 --> 08:29.842
I'm talkin' Woodchuck Berry.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.944
And you're offering us peanuts.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.212
Pig 3: I like peanuts.

08:33.212 --> 08:37.917
Pig 1: Let's talk moola,
long green, mucho dinero...

08:37.917 --> 08:40.453
Yeah, that's right..money.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.822
Pig 3: Oh, I love show biz talk.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.291
Listen to that.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.394
I told you, your dad
could play a mean sax.

08:48.394 --> 08:49.962
I see, what you mean.

08:49.962 --> 08:53.533
But.. I don't understand
why he never mentioned it.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.670
Pop?
Yeah!

08:57.670 --> 08:59.405
Um... just a minute!

08:59.405 --> 09:01.374
Uh... come in.

09:01.374 --> 09:05.077
Cyril Sneer!
After all these years.

09:05.077 --> 09:09.448
Woody? It's
great
to see you again.
Great!

09:09.448 --> 09:12.418
Pop, you never told
me you could play the sax.

09:12.418 --> 09:13.653
So..Woody...

09:13.653 --> 09:16.889
I hear, you're playing
at the Blue Spruce Cafe?

09:16.889 --> 09:17.924
Yeah. And I thought

09:17.924 --> 09:20.626
you might want to come
down and join in, Cyril.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.961
Just like old times.

09:21.961 --> 09:24.063
Yeah, Pop.
Wouldn't that be great?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.065
All of us playing together?

09:26.065 --> 09:28.501
Sure..sure,
I'll be there.

09:28.501 --> 09:31.170
Front row center.
Ha. In the audience.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.706
Oh..so you
still haven't gotten over...

09:33.706 --> 09:35.775
um..sorry for
bringing it up, Cyril.

09:35.775 --> 09:38.945
Okay. I'll see myself out.
See you tonight.

09:38.945 --> 09:40.212
See you, Woodchuck.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.280
You bet, Woody.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.648
I wouldn't miss it.

09:42.648 --> 09:45.751
Okay Pop,
what's this all about?

09:45.751 --> 09:48.754
Why are you so embarrassed
about playing the sax,

09:48.754 --> 09:52.425
and what's the big secret
between you and Woodchuck?

09:52.425 --> 09:56.762
Well..it's a
little.. silly really.

09:56.762 --> 10:01.634
It goes back to the days when
Woody and I played together.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.970
Yes. Those were great days.

10:03.970 --> 10:06.072
We were going to be stars.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.841
Well, at least...
at least Woody made it...

10:08.841 --> 10:19.952
♪ (instrumental music) ♪

10:23.189 --> 10:26.859
♪ (class plays badly) ♪

11:36.195 --> 11:39.198
...like I said,
it's a little silly.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.667
Just a childhood embarrassment,

11:41.667 --> 11:43.703
but I .. I never got over it.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.838
The idea of playing in public

11:45.838 --> 11:48.574
still brings me out
in a cold sweat.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.677
You've always told me
to face up to things, Pop.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.913
I think, you should
bring your sax down

11:53.913 --> 11:56.215
to the Cafe tonight and sit in.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.452
It'd be a.. a
second chance for you.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.054
No..no Cedric,
I couldn't...

12:02.621 --> 12:05.191
Pig 1: So we're talking
a major deal here, right?

12:05.191 --> 12:07.126
Terrific. We gotta do lunch!

12:08.060 --> 12:10.529
Pig 1: We've got a one night
gig for Woodchuck Berry

12:10.529 --> 12:12.264
at Rico's Rose Room.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.734
All we have to do is sit back

12:14.734 --> 12:17.336
and collect the cash.

12:17.336 --> 12:20.005
We're managers!

12:20.005 --> 12:23.809
Woodchuck Berry,
live at the Blue Spruce Cafe.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.047
Hmm, I don't know Bert,
I don't think Woodchuck

12:28.047 --> 12:29.648
wants all this hype.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.417
Ha. You think that's hype?

12:31.417 --> 12:34.019
Wait until you see,
what I've got lined up.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.055
Huh. Oh yeah, I'm still here.

12:36.055 --> 12:39.592
You will?... Fantastic!

12:39.592 --> 12:42.528
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

12:42.528 --> 12:44.897
O, Woody's on his way now.

12:44.897 --> 12:49.502
That was Danielle Manois,
the big record producer.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.171
She's coming to see
Woodchuck's show.

12:52.171 --> 12:53.506
And I've lined up agents,

12:53.506 --> 12:56.142
and producers, and TV crews...

12:56.142 --> 12:57.376
The works.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.612
Woodchuck's
not going to like this.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.080
Do you think, he liked it

13:01.080 --> 13:02.882
when they canceled
his world tour?

13:02.882 --> 13:06.786
No. They stole his future
when they did that.

13:06.786 --> 13:11.590
And Bert Raccoon is going to
give it back to him.

13:18.464 --> 13:21.367
Pig 1: There he is.
Let's go to work.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.937
Show canceled?

13:24.937 --> 13:26.071
Hey!

13:26.071 --> 13:27.773
What do you think you're doing?

13:27.773 --> 13:29.575
Pig 1: Correcting your poster.

13:29.575 --> 13:33.412
Woodchuck Berry is appearing
at Rico's Rose Room tonight.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.648
We got him a better deal there.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.584
Pig 3: Yeah. His
career is back on track,

13:38.584 --> 13:41.353
thanks to Three Pigs Management.

13:41.353 --> 13:43.189
Notice Woodchuck Berry's

13:43.189 --> 13:46.926
genuine signature
on the contract?

13:46.926 --> 13:49.361
Pig 2: Crummy old
Blue Spruce Cafe.

13:52.765 --> 13:56.335
What? Woodchuck
Berry had his big chance

13:56.335 --> 13:57.837
to make a comeback.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.839
And he just threw it away.

14:02.441 --> 14:05.311
Oh, Mr. Berry, Sir.

14:05.311 --> 14:08.614
We're so sorry.

14:08.614 --> 14:14.720
Pig 3: We apologize on behalf
of the entire Evergreen forest.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.889
Calm down,
little buddies.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.958
Now what's the matter?

14:18.958 --> 14:21.627
Show canceled. But why?

14:21.627 --> 14:25.397
Pig 2: They..um..couldn't
sell any tickets, um yeah.

14:25.397 --> 14:28.033
So they hired...
Happy Harry Arbuckle

14:28.033 --> 14:29.668
and his singing saw.

14:29.668 --> 14:33.138
Pig 3: They..er..figured,
he'd have broader appeal.

14:33.138 --> 14:35.074
But..but
why didn't Bert tell me...

14:35.074 --> 14:37.209
or Schaeffer..or somebody?

14:37.209 --> 14:40.312
Pig 1: Um..well.. They
just couldn't face you.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.849
So we... volunteered
to tell you.

14:43.849 --> 14:46.252
Ah well.
It's not the first time

14:46.252 --> 14:48.087
I've had a show canceled on me,

14:48.087 --> 14:50.356
and I guess it
won't be the last.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.359
Too bad though.
I was kinda looking forward

14:53.359 --> 14:55.227
to opening the Blue Spruce Cafe.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.229
They seemed like nice folk.

14:57.229 --> 15:01.400
Pig 1: Um.. We know another nice
place you could play tonight.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.369
Rico's Rose Room.

15:03.369 --> 15:04.837
Well, I don't know.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.274
Pig 3: Er.. It's a benefit show.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.410
Yeah? Well, I
never turn down a benefit.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.746
Pig 1: Great. Follow us!

15:13.746 --> 15:15.714
Uh,
who's the benefit for?

15:15.714 --> 15:16.949
Pig 3: Us.

15:16.949 --> 15:24.189
Pig 2: Er..us..U.S..um...
Unemployed stone carvers.

15:24.189 --> 15:25.424
US.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.892
Unemployed stone
carvers, eh?

15:26.892 --> 15:28.560
That's a new one on me.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.031
Woodchuck
could have had it all.

15:32.031 --> 15:34.900
He could have won
back his stardom.

15:34.900 --> 15:37.937
Just look at all these
agents and TV people

15:37.937 --> 15:40.239
and record producers.

15:40.239 --> 15:43.909
I can't believe he signed
up with Three Pigs Management.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.477
What do
I tell the audience?

15:45.477 --> 15:48.547
I wish Woodchuck had
said something to me.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.786
There's somebody
I can say something to.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.090
Come to gloat, Cyril?

15:58.090 --> 16:01.293
Come to laugh about
your little coup?

16:01.293 --> 16:04.830
Signing Woodchuck Berry
to an exclusive contract?

16:04.830 --> 16:08.500
As usual, you're
making no sense, fur ball!

16:08.500 --> 16:11.003
I came to hear
Woodchuck Berry's music...

16:11.003 --> 16:13.005
not your mindless meanderings.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.407
You stole
Woody's chance, Cyril.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.743
This was gonna be
his big comeback show.

16:17.743 --> 16:20.913
But your Three Pigs Management
have booked him

16:20.913 --> 16:23.349
at Rico's Rose Room.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.417
That sleazy dive?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.953
Why those back
stabbing bacon bits,

16:27.953 --> 16:29.822
I've got to get Woody back here.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.825
Look at all these paying
customers waiting for him!

16:34.426 --> 16:36.161
Schaeffer,
stall the audience.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.831
I don't know what's going on,
but I'll find out!

16:41.700 --> 16:43.035
Nice car, Cyril!

16:43.035 --> 16:44.770
What'll it do?

16:45.938 --> 16:46.972
Oww!

16:46.972 --> 16:48.974
Don't push
your luck, Raccoon!

16:51.110 --> 16:52.111
Hurumph!

16:53.445 --> 16:55.347
Psstt...
Ralph, I don't know

16:55.347 --> 16:57.182
how to stall an audience.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.717
What do I say?

16:58.717 --> 17:03.255
I don't know...
introduce yourself..tell a joke.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.991
Ehm.. Good evening.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.860
I'm Schaeffer...

17:07.860 --> 17:11.530
a funny thing happened
to me on the way to the Cafe...

17:11.530 --> 17:13.232
I, um...

17:13.232 --> 17:14.833
Do
I have to wear this?

17:14.833 --> 17:17.036
Pig 2: Think of your image.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.737
I am
thinking of my imagine.

17:18.737 --> 17:23.509
Pig 1: Then think about those
poor unemployed stone carvers.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.177
Three
Pigs Management, eh?

17:25.177 --> 17:26.879
B-b-boss!

17:26.879 --> 17:30.149
Hand over the contract,
you conniving' curly tails.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.551
Pig 2: We were gong to
surprise you boss. Honest.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.354
Surprise me?
Then do something right.

17:35.354 --> 17:36.922
That'd surprise me.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.558
Let's get out of here, Woody.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.193
This is no place for you.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.561
What's going on?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.862
I'll tell you on the way.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.497
Come on, your fans are waiting.

17:45.497 --> 17:49.201
Pig 2: But boss, we've committed
Woodchuck to a show... here!

17:49.201 --> 17:51.703
You pathetic
pork chops made the deal,

17:51.703 --> 17:53.605
so you do the show.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.208
Break a leg.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.013
And,
and then the second guy says,

18:01.013 --> 18:04.883
I don't know. I'm
not from around here.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.752
Ehm...

18:06.752 --> 18:08.987
I'm not from around here.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.593
Uh oh.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.096
I'm
dying up here, Ralph.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.901
And this is one of my favorites.
A bird.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.573
Come on, Cyril.
Where's Woody?

18:31.477 --> 18:33.879
...and now
I'll do a few impressions.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.747
I'm gonna knock your
teeth down your...

18:35.747 --> 18:37.116
Psstt.

18:37.116 --> 18:41.420
And now...
ladies and gentlemen...

18:41.420 --> 18:43.055
Woodchuck Berry!

18:45.124 --> 18:47.960
Bert? What's with all
the cameras and lights and...

18:47.960 --> 18:49.628
They're all here
for you, Woodchuck.

18:49.628 --> 18:52.464
All those agents and record
producers and reporters.

18:52.464 --> 18:55.667
It's your big chance
for a comeback.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.237
It's your night, Woodchuck!

18:58.237 --> 19:00.606
Go for it, big guy.

19:00.606 --> 19:02.141
B-b-but, Bert, I...

19:11.783 --> 19:13.819
Um.. Good evening...

19:13.819 --> 19:15.954
I..I..um. For my first song,

19:15.954 --> 19:18.023
... I..I'd like to play..um.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.825
Woodchuck!
Quit fooling around.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.660
The world is watching!

19:21.660 --> 19:23.128
What's wrong with Woody?

19:23.128 --> 19:26.932
Stage fright.
I think he's got stage fright.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.134
No. Not Woody.

19:29.134 --> 19:32.671
This can't happen to him.
I can't stand it.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.807
It's ..um...
Been a while..I..uh.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.811
You've always told
me to face up to things, Pop.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.676
Yahooo!

20:12.844 --> 20:14.913
The opening
of the Blue Spruce Cafe

20:14.913 --> 20:17.249
was everything Schaeffer
hoped it would be...

20:17.249 --> 20:19.585
An evening of music
and memories.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.253
As for Cyril Sneer,

20:21.253 --> 20:23.689
well, won't forget the
night he put himself

20:23.689 --> 20:25.357
on the line for an old friend,

20:25.357 --> 20:28.360
and gave himself
a second chance.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.330
Terrific.

20:31.330 --> 20:34.499
A record contract
with Danielle Manois.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.835
Eh, I guess, this
makes up for the time

20:36.835 --> 20:40.872
those no goods canceled your
world tour, eh, Woodchuck?

20:40.872 --> 20:42.841
Bert,
my friend, I'm the one

20:42.841 --> 20:44.576
who cancelled the world tour.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.279
I'd had enough of the crowds,
and bright lights.

20:47.279 --> 20:49.414
You can understand that,
can't you, Bert?

20:49.414 --> 20:52.384
Yeah, Woodchuck.
I thought, I mean...

20:52.384 --> 20:54.753
If I'd known..well,

20:54.753 --> 20:56.688
I never would've
put you through this.

20:56.688 --> 20:59.191
Gosh, I'm sorry, Woody.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.726
That's okay, Bert.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.394
You were only trying to help.

21:02.394 --> 21:04.763
And Cyril.. You were great.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.298
I knew, you could do it.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.400
Well, it wouldn't have
happened if you hadn't...

21:08.400 --> 21:10.302
Wait a minute...

21:10.302 --> 21:13.238
You've never had
stage fright before.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.906
Nope. Never.

21:14.906 --> 21:17.409
You didn't
do that just to get me...

21:17.409 --> 21:19.044
up on that stage?

21:19.044 --> 21:20.479
You didn't, did you?

21:20.479 --> 21:23.148
Who me?
By the way, Cyril,

21:23.148 --> 21:26.885
how come you just happened to
have a sax in your trunk?

21:26.885 --> 21:28.720
Oh that? Um...

21:28.720 --> 21:32.958
It's my spare.. I..er.. I always
keep a spare in the trunk.

21:38.063 --> 21:41.266
Pig 1: I can't keep
this up much longer!

21:41.266 --> 21:43.568
