00:10.600 --> 00:11.829
<i>Previously on</i> Dexter:

00:12.040 --> 00:13.793
Who's the guy that dropped you off?

00:14.000 --> 00:15.514
We didn't sleep together.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.757
You are certainly allowed
to be a player.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.192
You remember Cassie, right?
Yeah.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.436
New neighbour. Hi.
Hi.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.120
I kind of need to leave.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.755
I'll take care of Jamie.
Maybe we could reschedule?

00:27.000 --> 00:28.559
Yeah. I'd like that.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.872
Any reason why you
haven't taken the exam?

00:31.080 --> 00:33.959
I got your brother on my ass
about taking the sergeant's test--

00:34.160 --> 00:36.231
What is so wrong about
bettering yourself?

00:36.440 --> 00:37.635
You nailed it, bro.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.231
Is he your choice for sergeant?
I'm ready for more responsibility.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.830
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.360
I think you may be my father.

00:45.600 --> 00:49.150
Family showing up out of nowhere?
A lot of times, they want something.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.551
I you to do a background check
on someone.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.320
You think she's here to rip you off?
I don't know.

00:54.720 --> 00:55.836
Norma Rivera.

00:56.040 --> 00:58.794
She'd been having an affair
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.957
Dad, what's going on?
The Hamilton's son.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.351
Did you go to where
Norma Rivera was killed?

01:03.560 --> 01:06.758
I did.
What did you see in your analysis?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.798
Leave the kid alone.
He killed her.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.191
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.756
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to.

01:13.960 --> 01:15.792
Where's Yates?

01:16.000 --> 01:18.799
So this is finally over.
My tormenter's dead.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.276
Thanks to you, Dexter.
And Deb.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.711
I'm glad you found your way
back to each other.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.798
Well, the family that kills together...

01:26.000 --> 01:28.959
A few days ago, everything seemed
hopeless between Deb and me.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.436
But through Dr. Vogel,
I've got my sister back.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.120
It's beautiful out here, Dexter.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.919
I wanted to be with family.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.795
<i>Accidents happen,</i>

03:39.000 --> 03:41.151
<i>shattering our sense of control,</i>

03:41.400 --> 03:43.278
<i>if not our lives.</i>

03:46.600 --> 03:49.035
<i>It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.</i>

03:49.240 --> 03:52.119
<i>He's drawn to blood, like me.</i>

03:53.640 --> 03:56.519
<i>Did he kill Norma Rivera?</i>

04:07.760 --> 04:11.356
<i>After a week of vetting him, I haven't
been able to find definitive proof.</i>

04:17.519 --> 04:21.673
<i>But I'm sure if I keep following him
the truth will become clear.</i>

04:38.920 --> 04:40.559
<i>Or it could get murkier.</i>

05:14.960 --> 05:16.076
Dexter.

05:16.280 --> 05:18.431
Have you taken on
Zach Hamilton as a patient?

05:18.640 --> 05:19.835
It's nice to see you too.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.158
I have to protect you from another
murderer? How did he get to you?

05:23.640 --> 05:24.960
His father contacted me

05:25.160 --> 05:28.915
because of my reputation
for working with psychopaths.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.234
He's concerned about his son's
behaviour, his propensity for violence.

05:33.440 --> 05:34.874
It's more than a propensity.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.312
I think Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.478
And I take it that
you followed him here today

05:42.680 --> 05:44.672
because you're planning
to kill him?

05:44.880 --> 05:48.078
The thought had crossed my mind,
yes, if I can find solid proof.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.871
Well, then it would seem
that we have a conflict of interest.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.197
I don't believe this.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.716
You're going to work with another killer
after what happened with Yates?

06:01.080 --> 06:03.834
Dexter, I appreciate your concern,

06:04.040 --> 06:07.829
but I'm not going to talk about
Zach Hamilton with you any further.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.120
It wouldn't be ethical.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.437
Suddenly,
you're worried about ethics?

06:12.680 --> 06:15.070
I know. I threw them out
the window when I met you

06:15.280 --> 06:17.351
because my life was on the line.

06:17.640 --> 06:19.518
Now the threat is over.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.916
You're bringing another threat
into your life.

06:22.120 --> 06:25.397
It's my work. What can I say?

06:25.880 --> 06:27.951
I treat dangerous people.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.793
It's a hazard of the job.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.514
Besides, you have no proof

06:31.720 --> 06:33.951
that Zach Hamilton
is guilty of anything.

06:34.680 --> 06:35.796
I will.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.634
If you do,

06:37.840 --> 06:39.797
then come to see me first,

06:40.040 --> 06:41.554
before you do anything,

06:41.760 --> 06:44.195
and we'll have
another conversation.

06:45.320 --> 06:47.232
Would you do me that favour?

06:48.400 --> 06:49.959
We'll see.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.909
Maybe this is why
she tracked me down, for money.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.873
You don't know that.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.640
I mean, maybe she genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.560
What, at the same time
her Hyundai's being repossessed?

07:12.760 --> 07:15.070
Has she asked you for money?
No.

07:15.280 --> 07:18.557
But she always seems to be missing
her purse when the check comes.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.590
I thought we had a real connection.
You like having Niki in your life?

07:27.800 --> 07:29.632
I do.
Then why don't you wait it out

07:29.880 --> 07:31.997
and see how it plays out?

07:32.280 --> 07:35.114
In the meantime,
you can enjoy her company.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.634
Okay.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.599
Hm, heh.
Thanks, Deb.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.399
Welcome.

07:51.640 --> 07:54.360
Deb, got a new case.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.520
Let me guess, someone suspects their
significant other is fucking around.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.511
Yeah, but this one
is a bit different.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.519
How?
Because the person is me

08:06.720 --> 08:08.200
and the significant other

08:08.400 --> 08:11.040
is my sister's ass-chasing,
shithead boyfriend.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.072
Kevin Wyman, notorious player,

08:13.280 --> 08:16.193
frequents a singles bar in a hotel
where he keeps a suite.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.878
Have you tried talking to her?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.150
Susan doesn't listen to me.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.591
It'd just push her
more quickly into his arms.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.029
So that's off the table.

08:24.240 --> 08:27.756
Well, going behind her back
seems kind of fucked up.

08:27.960 --> 08:30.680
It's gotta be this way.
I gotta catch this guy in the act.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.599
Okay, but you're doing it
by yourself.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.200
I need your help on this, Deb.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.510
It'd be a lot less conspicuous

08:35.679 --> 08:37.399
if we work this as a couple.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.751
Well, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.155
Well, are you comfortable
getting a pay cheque?

08:45.520 --> 08:46.795
Okay, boss.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.433
Thank you.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.671
Where does this piece go?

08:57.040 --> 08:58.759
Right here.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.800
Very good.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.593
Dex?

09:02.840 --> 09:05.355
Don't forget, my birthday picnic's
in a few days, okay?

09:05.600 --> 09:08.069
On the beach, outside of Papa's.
Bring Harrison.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.158
Yeah, we'll be there.
Great.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.313
You know who else
will be there? Cassie.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.749
I heard you have a date with her.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.076
No, it's not a date.

09:16.320 --> 09:20.155
I felt like I owed her one after we both
bailed on your dinner the other night.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.511
Why won't you just admit
that you like her

09:22.720 --> 09:24.712
and that I am an
awesome matchmaker?

09:24.960 --> 09:28.271
I admit that you're an awesome nanny.
You'll have to settle for that.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.552
We'll revisit this after the date.

09:31.880 --> 09:33.360
Oh, by the way,

09:33.560 --> 09:35.233
the TV remote has

09:35.440 --> 09:36.510
been missing since yesterday.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.433
I think somebody hid it

09:38.680 --> 09:41.514
but I can't get anything
out of him.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.117
Harrison, did you
take the TV remote?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.595
No.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.554
Do you know where it is?
No.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.156
He says he didn't take it.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.470
Right.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.195
Guess I'll just keep looking for it.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.115
Homicide in Liberty City.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.358
It looks like you're gonna have
to finish that puzzle on your own.

10:03.560 --> 10:05.597
I'm doing all the work anyway.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.956
Yeah, you are.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.072
Bye.
Bye.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.759
Welcome to spatter-land.

10:21.960 --> 10:23.314
Hope you brought extra string.

10:23.560 --> 10:25.597
Never leave home without it.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.350
Good news.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.637
We have the victim's boyfriend
in custody.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.309
A witness saw him
taking off from the scene,

10:33.520 --> 10:35.512
and he forgot to change
his bloody socks.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.473
Heh. God bless stupid killers.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.353
<i>Once again, drawn to blood.</i>

10:54.280 --> 10:57.557
<i>Looks like Zach has just given me
the in I need.</i>

11:17.720 --> 11:20.076
Zach Hamilton, right?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.953
You were at my house.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.316
That's right.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.315
You guys find out
who killed Norma?

11:26.840 --> 11:29.674
No luck. It's a dead end.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.800
You like to shoot crime scenes?

11:34.040 --> 11:36.919
Yeah, I got a police scanner
app on my phone.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.600
Better than playing video games.

11:38.840 --> 11:41.594
You ever been on the other side
of the yellow tape?

11:42.120 --> 11:44.760
Nope.
This is as close as I've gotten.

11:45.640 --> 11:47.950
Well, come on.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.111
Are you serious?
Yeah, just don't touch anything.

12:00.960 --> 12:02.553
Whoa.

12:04.520 --> 12:06.432
This is amazing.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.038
<i>I remember that feeling.
Awe, wonder.</i>

12:10.240 --> 12:11.356
<i>It only fed the urge.</i>

12:11.560 --> 12:14.029
Hey, can I take some pictures?

12:15.880 --> 12:19.556
It's usually against protocol,

12:19.800 --> 12:21.029
but what the hell? Go ahead.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.397
Cool. Thanks.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.990
So, what happened to her?

12:29.200 --> 12:30.714
She was stabbed.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.435
Yeah, obviously.
But, like, you know, how?

12:33.920 --> 12:36.719
<i>If I open up to him,
maybe he'll open up to me.</i>

12:36.920 --> 12:38.434
Come on. I can handle it.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.077
Well, the victim
tried to defend herself.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.232
There were defensive
wounds on her body

12:46.440 --> 12:50.559
but you can also tell by these
big, round drops on the ground.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.998
And this multiple cast-off spatter

12:56.200 --> 12:59.352
suggests that she was
stabbed several times.

12:59.560 --> 13:02.280
And the arterial spurting here

13:02.480 --> 13:05.359
indicates that the killer
severed her carotid artery

13:05.560 --> 13:07.233
with the first stab.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.959
You can tell all that
just by looking at the blood?

13:12.840 --> 13:13.990
Pretty much.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.473
Awesome.

13:18.680 --> 13:20.831
So I heard you caught
the guy who did it.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.872
Yeah, her boyfriend.
How?

13:23.080 --> 13:26.073
He was sloppy.
Left a bloody print and DNA.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.471
He was spotted
driving away from the scene.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.353
Oh, yeah? What kind of car?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.916
<i>Must have heard his Porsche
was seen at Norma's apartment.</i>

13:33.160 --> 13:34.355
No one noticed.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.272
So the killer,

13:42.280 --> 13:44.431
he should've worn gloves
and long sleeves,

13:44.640 --> 13:46.120
made sure
he was covered up.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.119
<i>He's making this a teaching moment.</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:52.275
Well, yeah, if he was smart.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.875
<i>The kid's a quick study,</i>

13:55.080 --> 13:57.515
<i>but that doesn't prove
he killed Norma Rivera.</i>

13:59.080 --> 14:03.711
So, hey, I gotta get going,
but thanks.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.632
Hey, why don't you give me a call
when you print those up?

14:07.840 --> 14:09.832
I'd love to take a look.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.519
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.755
<i>Time to make another connection.</i>

14:26.560 --> 14:29.712
Here you go.
Thank you.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.230
Thank you
for doing this with me.

14:32.440 --> 14:35.558
When you own a food truck, you
have to scope out the competition.

14:35.760 --> 14:37.274
Plus I just really love to eat.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.556
Yeah, no problem.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.036
I wouldn't miss these peanut butter
and Nutella fries for anything.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.754
Mm-hm.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.516
So you're indulging me
in my favourite pastime.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.359
What do you like to do for fun?

14:52.560 --> 14:54.995
You know, normal stuff.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.233
Like what?

14:58.320 --> 15:00.630
Um...
Heh, heh.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.917
I like spending time with my son.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.316
I already know you're
a great dad. What else?

15:08.200 --> 15:09.270
I love my job.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.560
But that's work.
What are you passionate about?

15:15.480 --> 15:16.994
I like to bowl.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.873
You're passionate about bowling?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.678
No. Heh.
Heh, heh.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.678
Of course not.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.475
I just do it for fun, once in a while.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.717
What about your weekends
or your free time?

15:34.160 --> 15:35.640
Oh, I have a boat.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.115
Oh, I love to sail.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.677
No, it's a motorboat.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.997
Oh. You water-ski?

15:42.320 --> 15:43.720
No.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.520
Race?
No.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.033
Do you scuba dive?

15:49.560 --> 15:50.994
No.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.755
Heh, heh.
What do you do on your boat?

15:55.160 --> 15:56.480
I just...

15:56.720 --> 15:59.679
Take it out and...

16:00.560 --> 16:02.552
Turn around and come back.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.076
That's it?

16:05.280 --> 16:07.556
<i>That's all I can tell you.</i>

16:08.120 --> 16:09.793
I think we may need
some alcohol.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.234
Right.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.035
<i>Dating is harder than I remember.</i>

16:23.040 --> 16:24.713
Oh, this guy is fucking pathetic.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.520
I get that you hate the guy,
but looking isn't cheating.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.632
It's a slow night.
Give him a minute.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.239
So you said Susan
doesn't listen.

16:34.440 --> 16:36.909
Does that mean you all
have a strained relationship?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.600
Not from my end, no.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.313
But from hers?

16:42.320 --> 16:43.959
Yeah, you know, probably.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.599
I mean, look, I couldn't wait
to get away from my old man,

16:47.800 --> 16:49.393
and Susan was just a kid.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.560
You know, I should have
at least picked up the phone.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.109
But I never did,
you know, so...

16:59.400 --> 17:01.790
Well, you can't undo the past.

17:03.360 --> 17:06.000
And families fuck you up.
That's just the way it is.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.119
I can stop Susan from fucking up her future.
I can do that.

17:14.079 --> 17:16.515
It looks like he's
packing it in for the night.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.116
If you wanna catch this guy,
why don't I set him up?

17:19.319 --> 17:22.392
We can see if he takes the bait.
No, I don't want you doing that.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.439
I worked Vice. I've done
worse than that before.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.751
I just need pictures
of him hitting on you.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.553
Certainly nothing
more than that.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.114
Are you sure?

17:33.360 --> 17:36.990
I mean, I could marry him,
maybe pop out a couple of babies.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.914
Let's go.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.192
Dexter, thanks for coming.
Sure.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.792
Couldn't wait to show you
these photos.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.912
Yeah, no problem.
It's on my way to work.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.236
Doughnut?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.229
Fucking A.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.236
Mm.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.959
Well?

18:16.040 --> 18:19.351
<i>He treats the blood
like a swimsuit model.</i>

18:20.160 --> 18:21.753
Well,

18:22.480 --> 18:24.119
very colourful.

18:24.320 --> 18:27.870
You know, a lot of photographers
like to mute down their reds.

18:28.120 --> 18:30.794
You know,
find it too distracting,

18:31.040 --> 18:33.350
but I like to ride the saturation.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.795
Hm.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.074
You think I overdid it?

18:38.760 --> 18:40.752
No way. These are you.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.474
That's the important thing.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.360
Well, I can work you up
some prints, if you want.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.954
I wouldn't have them
if it weren't for you.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.312
Actually, I think I have
plenty of my own.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.840
Right.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.475
Of course.
I forget it was a crime scene.

18:56.680 --> 19:00.594
Keep thinking that dead chick
spilled all that blood just for me.

19:07.520 --> 19:08.840
Who's she?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.434
Uh, it's nothing.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.359
Just a lens test.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.075
New 300 millimetre.
Fucking monster.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.270
Wow.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.120
Excuse me.

19:24.280 --> 19:25.680
Yep?

19:33.280 --> 19:37.194
Jesus, you still drunk from last night
or are you starting a new bender?

19:37.440 --> 19:41.070
Yeah, okay. Yeah, I said okay.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.991
Uh, I gotta go.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.436
Anything wrong?
It's fine. I just gotta go.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.119
Sure, some other time then.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.759
<i>I'll have to find another way
to get to him.</i>

20:04.000 --> 20:05.036
Ah, lieutenant.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.993
Tell me something.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.237
Did you decide
you don't need a sergeant?

20:09.440 --> 20:11.875
Sir?
I expected an announcement by now.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.116
What's going on?

20:13.800 --> 20:17.919
To tell you the truth, I'm having trouble
narrowing down my choice.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.311
I know you want me to pick Miller,
and on paper, I can't argue with that.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.319
Scored higher on the test,
got the experience, the record--

20:30.520 --> 20:32.398
She's African-American,
a woman.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.798
Here's the thing,
Quinn has his attributes too.

20:36.920 --> 20:37.956
Name one.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.196
He's street-smart.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.078
Look, I know what's going on here.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.556
What do you mean?
You want me to be the bad guy.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.996
You want me to insist
that you promote Miller.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.431
That way you can tell Quinn,
"I had no choice."

20:49.680 --> 20:51.956
I'm not sure that's--
You're lieutenant now.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.640
Time to grow a set of balls.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.435
I wanna hear something
by the end of the day.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.390
Just like old times, huh?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.874
You, me, steak, beer.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.072
Yeah, it's been a while.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.035
So how are things?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.550
Good, great. You?

21:38.760 --> 21:41.798
Fine. Better.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.432
Good. I'm glad.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.593
Me too.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.759
I think these are done.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.236
Well, how's work?

22:01.440 --> 22:03.432
Uh, crazy.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.520
Elway wants to catch his sister's
boyfriend fucking around on her,

22:07.760 --> 22:10.798
so I offered myself as bait
so he'd get it done.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.390
What--? You did what?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.438
I used to do it
all the time in Vice.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.996
Yeah, and you hated it.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.032
Why put yourself
in that position again?

22:19.240 --> 22:20.754
Because he's my boss.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.351
And because I can only take
one control freak at a time.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.594
Sorry.

22:34.680 --> 22:36.399
This is tough.

22:38.640 --> 22:39.676
A little.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.515
Not exactly worth living for.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.393
What?

22:45.240 --> 22:47.800
You said that once
when you tasted one of my steaks,

22:48.000 --> 22:49.559
that it was worth living for.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.520
For some reason,
I've always remembered that.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.750
It'll get easier, Dex.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.156
We're just getting
back in the saddle, you know?

22:59.360 --> 23:02.398
Yeah, I think we might be
eating a saddle.

23:06.000 --> 23:08.276
Are you still seeing Dr. Vogel?

23:08.480 --> 23:11.678
Yeah, it's too bad for me
there's no magic pill to cure PTSD.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.352
Well, as long as she's helping you.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.840
Like, she knows everything
about our lives because of Dad,

23:18.080 --> 23:19.639
but I know jack shit about her.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.672
Where'd she get
that fucking accent?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.991
And who the fuck is Rich?

23:24.640 --> 23:27.200
Her husband.
She was married?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.039
When I first looked into her,

23:29.240 --> 23:31.471
I found out some stuff
about her background,

23:31.720 --> 23:34.474
and she was married
to a Dr. Richard Vogel.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.200
Huh.

23:36.920 --> 23:41.039
Okay, so Harrison's asleep.
And look what I found under his bed.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.560
Ooh, someone's in trouble.

23:42.760 --> 23:43.955
He lied about it.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.514
At least now we know why.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.313
I hope it's under warranty,

23:47.520 --> 23:51.912
or I'll be stuck with whatever's on
PBS Kids for the foreseeable future.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.952
I'll talk to him.
Okay.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.635
Enjoy your dinner, guys.
Bye.

23:59.760 --> 24:02.116
Should I be worried
that Harrison's lying?

24:02.320 --> 24:04.391
He's 4, doofus.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.114
Right.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.276
This steak tastes like asshole.
Yeah.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.273
Let's order pizza.

24:12.480 --> 24:13.800
With pineapple, please.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.957
Not on my half.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.313
Sorry, cow.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.514
What's up?

24:41.360 --> 24:43.591
I'm promoting Miller to sergeant.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.800
Say that again?

24:46.520 --> 24:48.398
I'm giving Miller the job. I'm sorry.

24:48.600 --> 24:51.752
I just think she's
the most qualified candidate.

24:51.960 --> 24:55.397
Are you fucking kidding me?
I mean, after all the quizzes,

24:55.600 --> 24:57.956
and the speeches
about bettering my life?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.356
You actually made me want this,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.592
and now you're gonna take it away.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.951
Why, because I didn't solve
the Rivera case?

25:05.160 --> 25:06.560
No, of course not.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.753
It's just a lot of other stuff
I can't ignore, man.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.916
The Nadia thing,
shooting Novikov.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.270
You know what? Fuck it.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.915
You did what you thought was right.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.799
Leave it at that.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.234
Hey.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.672
I need everything you got
on the Norma Rivera case,

25:31.920 --> 25:34.640
anything that points
to Zach Hamilton.

25:34.880 --> 25:40.000
Uh, well, forensically, there's not much.
There's nothing, actually.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.949
Fuck it. I'll just tail the little prick 24/7
until I get what I need.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.913
<i>If Quinn's stalking Zach, how can I?</i>

25:48.080 --> 25:50.197
Won't even know I'm there
till I bust him.

25:50.440 --> 25:52.318
You mind if I come along?

25:55.040 --> 25:56.633
You want to come along?

25:57.520 --> 25:59.876
Things are slow here.
I'm going a little stir-crazy.

26:00.120 --> 26:01.952
Maybe you could use
another set of eyes?

26:02.680 --> 26:04.194
Sure.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.751
I mean, you think
Miller's clean? Come on.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.270
You dig deep enough
on anyone in this department

26:30.520 --> 26:32.477
and you know what you find?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.752
What?
The shit.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.952
It's there. I mean, we all got it.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.317
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.749
Yeah, I can't argue with that.
We've all got the shit.

26:43.960 --> 26:45.360
Yeah.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.120
Big difference is some people
get away with theirs

26:48.320 --> 26:50.039
and some people don't.

26:51.080 --> 26:52.912
You're a good detective.
It'll work out.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.794
Yeah, I'm just worried about
how Jamie's going to take it.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.437
I think she was all excited
about me moving up in the world,

26:59.680 --> 27:01.637
making something out of my life.

27:01.840 --> 27:04.833
She'll probably break up
with my ass now.

27:05.640 --> 27:08.678
Jesus Christ, how many pictures
of fucking women in tights

27:08.880 --> 27:10.234
does this pervert need?

27:10.840 --> 27:12.718
Apparently, a lot.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.711
How's Deb doing?
I've been worried about her.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.273
She's good. She's much better.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.440
You guys work out
whatever your issue was?

27:22.640 --> 27:23.710
What do you mean?

27:23.920 --> 27:27.755
I mean, you guys have been connected
at the hip for most of your lives.

27:28.000 --> 27:31.232
All of a sudden, you're not talking,
you don't see each other.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.391
Somebody shit
in somebody's Cheerios.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.114
Yeah.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.156
Just typical brother and sister stuff.
It's no big deal.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.595
Something had her fucked up.

27:42.840 --> 27:45.674
How weird was it that
she confessed to killing LaGuerta?

27:45.880 --> 27:47.599
<i>I should have stayed in my office.</i>

27:47.800 --> 27:49.757
What was that about?

27:53.480 --> 27:56.518
<i>That's the woman in the photo
that Zach didn't want me to see.</i>

27:57.320 --> 28:00.597
<i>And he isn't looking at the class,
he's looking at her.</i>

28:02.240 --> 28:03.435
You know what I'm saying?

28:03.640 --> 28:04.915
<i>Fortunately, Quinn isn't.</i>

28:05.680 --> 28:09.469
Well, people do weird stuff
when they're under a lot of stress.

28:09.680 --> 28:12.354
We may never know
what that was all about.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.153
All right, see you guys later.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.558
Looks like they're done.
- So is our guy.

28:23.840 --> 28:24.876
Buckle up.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.554
Hey.
Hey.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.235
Wow. Okay. Uh...
What?

28:48.440 --> 28:50.591
You look incredible.
Good job.

28:50.800 --> 28:53.440
Well, that's the point.
Don't look so fucking surprised.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.155
Didn't leave me a lot of places
to put the transmitter.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.716
Are you bitching? I'm the one
helping you, remember?

28:58.960 --> 29:02.112
I just don't wanna touch
anything I'm not supposed to.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.680
Here.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.279
Thank you.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.120
Mic?
There you go.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.755
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.436
Okay.
Okay?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.552
Yep.
All right.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.358
Quickly, just say
something for me.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.358
You blush like a little girl.

29:42.520 --> 29:45.558
Heh, heh. Okay, just...

29:46.440 --> 29:48.909
Just get him alone.
That's all I need, okay?

29:49.120 --> 29:51.840
Okay.
Thank you.

29:53.920 --> 29:55.991
I'm really glad we met.

29:56.880 --> 29:58.519
Me too.

30:00.440 --> 30:03.000
You know, I didn't know
if I mentioned it,

30:03.160 --> 30:05.391
but tonight's kind of a celebration.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.398
Yeah?

30:08.000 --> 30:10.196
Closed a huge deal.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.199
Two blocks downtown,
prime views of the bay.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.677
It's gonna rent through the roof
and I get a big piece of it.

30:16.880 --> 30:20.351
Something tells me you like
getting a big piece of everything.

30:22.360 --> 30:24.352
Whenever I can manage.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.835
Congratulations.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.269
Thank you.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.750
I just wish I had a present for you.

30:33.800 --> 30:36.520
What do you say we migrate
to my suite?

30:36.720 --> 30:39.280
Got a nice little private bar.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.080
It's a lot quieter than this place.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.239
All done here.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.638
You're gonna love the views.
It's beautiful.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.951
Nice, light music.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.994
It'll be real nice.
No, save it for the room.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.760
What, you playing hard to get?
I don't kiss in public.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.639
You're bashful.
Mm-hm. Maybe.

31:06.040 --> 31:08.430
Get your fucking hands off of her!

31:08.640 --> 31:11.235
Jesus, Elway.

31:11.960 --> 31:12.996
The hell is going on?

31:13.200 --> 31:15.795
She's wired, douche bag.
You're done.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.229
You fucking son of a bitch.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.194
You're gonna call Susan tonight.
Tell her it's over.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.830
If you don't, she's getting an e-mail.
You got it?

31:23.520 --> 31:25.318
You got it?

31:25.520 --> 31:27.591
Yeah, I got it.
Good.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.359
You're an asshole.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.754
The fuck are you thinking?

31:37.200 --> 31:39.157
I'm sorry, all right? I just--

31:39.360 --> 31:43.798
Seeing him paw all over you like that,
I don't like that shit.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.275
I'm sorry about your top.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.075
That's okay. It's all right. I got it.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.795
<i>Sofia Fuentes,
current place of employment:</i>

32:14.000 --> 32:16.356
<i>the Cypress Harbour Yacht Club,</i>

32:16.560 --> 32:18.711
<i>which is owned by Zach's family.</i>

32:18.920 --> 32:22.152
<i>That's where Zach must have
first laid eyes on her.</i>

32:22.400 --> 32:25.359
<i>If Zach takes pictures of his victims
before he's killed them,</i>

32:25.560 --> 32:28.519
<i>chances are he likes
after photos as well.</i>

32:28.720 --> 32:32.191
<i>If he did kill Norma Rivera,
then he's got the photos to prove it.</i>

33:18.880 --> 33:22.078
<i>Sofia. Probably his next victim.</i>

33:22.960 --> 33:26.636
<i>Now I just need to find
any photos of Norma Rivera.</i>

34:23.400 --> 34:24.993
<i>Norma Rivera.</i>

34:25.199 --> 34:27.157
<i>Taken seconds after she was killed,</i>

34:27.360 --> 34:31.877
<i>the pool of blood around her head
growing from one image to the next.</i>

34:35.960 --> 34:39.158
<i>Zach Hamilton,
murder weapon in hand.</i>

34:39.360 --> 34:41.431
<i>All the proof I need.</i>

34:49.360 --> 34:51.476
You wanted proof. There it is.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.592
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

34:54.920 --> 34:58.516
Yes. I know.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.798
You know?
Mm.

35:02.640 --> 35:06.031
Zach told me
during our first session.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.835
But you didn't tell me
because of your sense of ethics?

35:09.080 --> 35:11.311
Oh, forget ethics.

35:11.520 --> 35:15.036
Why would I help facilitate the death
of someone I see potential in?

35:15.240 --> 35:17.277
Potential? He's a killer.
He deserves to die.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.878
Heh, heh. Isn't that a little
intolerant, coming from you?

35:22.080 --> 35:23.719
I don't kill innocent people.

35:26.640 --> 35:28.393
But you might have,

35:29.400 --> 35:31.312
if it hadn't been for Harry and me.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.355
You could even
be on death row right now.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.233
Right.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.552
But you were spared.
Yeah, spared because of the code.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.109
That's an interesting idea.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.720
What do you mean?

35:48.360 --> 35:50.750
What if we were
to teach Zach the code?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.276
You can't be serious.
Why not?

35:53.480 --> 35:56.678
It never occurred to me to try again,

35:56.920 --> 35:59.116
because I didn't have Harry.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.757
But now I have you.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.197
Maybe it's time to see

36:05.160 --> 36:06.674
if the experiment will work.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.553
This isn't a science project.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.151
No, but it's a matter of life and death.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.000
Zach's life is on the line.

36:15.200 --> 36:19.114
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

36:19.360 --> 36:23.036
I told you, I see something in him.
And it worked with you.

36:23.280 --> 36:26.034
Zach and I are nothing alike.
No, of course not.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.034
You are definitely one of a kind.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.994
He killed an innocent
and he's getting ready to do it again.

36:32.200 --> 36:33.919
He needs to die.

36:42.640 --> 36:45.519
<i>Harrison.
I never intended to have a son,</i>

36:45.760 --> 36:49.834
<i>but now he's the one thing in my life
that seems most right.</i>

36:50.040 --> 36:51.952
There she is!

36:52.240 --> 36:53.276
Hi!

36:55.160 --> 36:57.391
Yay! Aw. Mwah.

36:57.600 --> 37:00.718
Happy birthday.
Aw, thanks, Dex. Thank you.

37:00.920 --> 37:01.956
Can I go play?

37:03.240 --> 37:05.835
Yeah, sure. Have fun.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.316
Stay close, Harrison.

37:14.720 --> 37:15.836
Yeah, I'm--

37:16.080 --> 37:18.993
I'm not sure if he's a date
or just a friend.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.590
I mean, what I do know
is that she's very attractive,

37:21.840 --> 37:22.876
and men like her,

37:23.080 --> 37:25.720
so if you want a chance,
you better move fast.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.039
Right.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.753
I think I'm gonna go grab a beer.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.112
You know, this may sound weird,

37:37.320 --> 37:40.392
and I don't mean
to sound creepy or anything,

37:40.600 --> 37:42.432
but I think I really like you.

37:42.640 --> 37:44.518
Aw, I like you too.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.477
I'm not really ready
to call you "Dad,"

37:47.680 --> 37:50.354
but you're cool.

37:50.560 --> 37:53.553
"Cool"? Usually, I'm the only one
that calls me that.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.274
So that's awesome.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.234
Oh, hey. I got you something.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.114
What?
It's really not a big deal.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.154
It's not a big deal?
You're giving me $5000? Why?

38:06.360 --> 38:08.829
Hey, I know
you could really use it.

38:09.040 --> 38:12.112
But you should know that
that's really all that I can afford.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.198
I don't understand.
How do you know that?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.039
Well, you know,

38:16.240 --> 38:18.072
I just did a little research on you.

38:18.720 --> 38:20.996
You checked into me?
Like a criminal?

38:21.200 --> 38:23.032
No, I just wanted to make sure

38:23.240 --> 38:25.038
you were who you said you were.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.556
And that I wasn't after you
for your money?

38:28.440 --> 38:30.432
I just--
Look, I have debts,

38:30.640 --> 38:32.154
but they're soon to be paid,

38:32.360 --> 38:34.431
and that's not really
any of your business.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.552
I wouldn't ask you for this.

38:36.760 --> 38:37.989
I'm really sorry.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.635
Do you understand that it was
hard for me to do this?

38:40.880 --> 38:41.916
To find my father?

38:42.120 --> 38:44.430
But I felt like it was worth it
to get to know you.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.553
You know, maybe I was wrong.
Here you go. No, thank you.

38:47.800 --> 38:48.916
Hey, Niki--

38:49.120 --> 38:51.476
All right, everyone.
I'd like to make a toast.

38:51.720 --> 38:56.317
To the best kid sister
a guy could ever have, Jamie.

38:56.560 --> 38:57.789
Aw.
Aw. Thank you.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.229
I love you.
Happy birthday.

38:59.480 --> 39:01.073
I love you too.

39:01.280 --> 39:02.509
Aw, thank you, guys.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.313
Thank you so much for coming.

39:04.520 --> 39:08.355
You guys are the best, and it
really is so nice to have you all

39:08.560 --> 39:10.199
here in one place together.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.676
I love you guys. Cheers.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.477
Happy birthday.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.793
And here's to you, Sergeant Quinn.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.875
I know it's premature--

39:22.080 --> 39:23.753
Way premature.
You didn't tell her?

39:23.960 --> 39:26.395
I didn't want to upset her
on her birthday.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.354
No.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.831
You didn't get the job?

39:32.000 --> 39:33.195
You didn't give it to him?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.835
I had to go with the person
best for the job.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.190
And how is that not Joey?

39:37.400 --> 39:39.596
Hey, it's okay.
He gave the promotion to Miller.

39:39.800 --> 39:40.836
It's, you know...

39:41.040 --> 39:43.430
But going for sergeant
was your idea in the first place.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.914
You set him up.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.032
I didn't mean to.
Jesus, Angel.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.233
Hey.
Dexter, hi.

39:57.440 --> 40:00.000
How are you?
I'm great. You?

40:00.200 --> 40:02.317
Great. Nice party, huh?

40:02.520 --> 40:04.079
Yeah.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.633
The beach.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.634
Yeah. Harrison looks like
he's having a really nice time.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.473
Yep.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.310
Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.
Oliver, Dexter.

40:16.520 --> 40:19.080
Nice to meet you.
Yeah, you too.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.159
I didn't know if you wanted
the Belgian brown or the pilsner,

40:22.360 --> 40:24.431
so I got you the one
with the moose on it.

40:24.640 --> 40:26.871
Can't go wrong with a moose.
Heh, heh, heh.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.159
I'm gonna go check on Harrison.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.990
Okay, take care.

40:34.760 --> 40:36.353
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's great.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.791
- That's your neighbour, right?
- Yes.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.840
What happened with Susan?
Wyman break up with her?

40:51.040 --> 40:52.838
Yeah. Yeah, he did.

40:53.480 --> 40:54.516
So it's a win.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.116
Why do you look like someone
just ran over your dog?

40:57.320 --> 41:00.552
I just got off the phone with her
and she couldn't stop crying.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.474
She thinks it's all her fault,

41:02.680 --> 41:05.559
like somehow, she's not
good enough or something.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.719
Well, she would've caught him
cheating eventually.

41:08.920 --> 41:11.389
The result
would have been the same.

41:11.840 --> 41:15.151
Yeah, but it wouldn't be me
that made her cry.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.516
Jesus, I just feel like shit.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.232
People can't help
sticking their noses in

41:21.440 --> 41:23.193
when it's someone
they care about.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.313
I know.

41:25.520 --> 41:28.160
I know. You tried to tell me.

41:30.960 --> 41:32.952
So does that mean
you care about me?

41:34.400 --> 41:37.871
Only to the extent
that you sign my pay cheque.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.873
Touché.

41:42.080 --> 41:45.676
Okay, what are we gonna read tonight?
Let me guess, <i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

41:45.880 --> 41:47.473
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

41:57.280 --> 42:02.196
Before I read to you, I gotta
talk to you about the TV remote.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.800
You said you didn't take it,

42:04.040 --> 42:06.430
but Jamie found it
under your bed.

42:11.000 --> 42:12.354
I didn't mean to break it.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.597
I was pretending
it was a Thunder Blaster

42:14.840 --> 42:17.230
and I dropped it in the kitchen.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.352
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Accidents happen.

42:19.560 --> 42:21.279
But you lied to me.
That's a big deal.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.312
We should never lie.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.112
But, Daddy,

42:29.920 --> 42:31.752
you lie.

42:34.320 --> 42:36.073
What do you mean?

42:48.520 --> 42:51.080
You told me Doggy got lost.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.840
I saw you throw him in the trash.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.350
I had to rescue him.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.037
You're right. I lied.

43:04.640 --> 43:07.872
Doggy got dirty,
and I tried to clean him up,

43:08.080 --> 43:10.800
and when I couldn't,
I threw him away.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.910
I'm sorry I lied to you, Harrison.

43:14.120 --> 43:16.680
That's okay.
But can I keep him?

43:16.880 --> 43:18.519
I really love him.

43:18.720 --> 43:21.155
<i>He's soaked in blood
that links me to a murder.</i>

43:21.360 --> 43:24.114
Yeah, but maybe
he should live under the bed.

43:24.320 --> 43:26.551
Okay.
Okay.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.989
<i>Wee Monkeys.</i>

43:28.200 --> 43:30.157
<i>Wee Monkeys!</i>

43:30.360 --> 43:33.956
<i>It's no accident,
Harrison catching me in a lie.</i>

43:34.960 --> 43:37.350
<i>I can live with my lies,
but how long can Harrison</i>

43:37.560 --> 43:40.120
<i>before he finally sees through?</i>

43:40.360 --> 43:42.158
I should be back
in a few hours.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.114
Sorry to keep you late
on your birthday.

43:45.320 --> 43:48.119
Trust me, it'll probably be
the highlight of my day.

43:48.320 --> 43:51.518
<i>Vogel doesn't want me to kill Zach,
but she's wrong about him.</i>

43:51.720 --> 43:53.871
<i>He deserves nothing but my table.</i>

43:55.000 --> 43:56.798
<i>He's here.</i>

44:01.640 --> 44:02.756
Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.

44:26.400 --> 44:28.073
<i>Where is he?</i>

44:35.640 --> 44:39.395
<i>Why would Zach buy a car
for $1200?</i>

44:39.600 --> 44:42.115
<i>Because the one mistake
he made with Norma Rivera</i>

44:42.360 --> 44:44.750
<i>was showing up to kill her
in a red Porsche.</i>

44:44.960 --> 44:47.350
<i>He's going to kill Sofia tonight.</i>

45:04.680 --> 45:06.160
<i>Cypress Harbour Yacht Club.</i>
Hi.

45:06.360 --> 45:09.239
Could you tell me
if Sofia Fuentes is working tonight?

45:09.440 --> 45:12.194
<i>She gets off here in a few minutes.</i>
Thank you.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.233
<i>Zach, waiting to make his move.</i>

45:45.680 --> 45:49.071
<i>And Quinn,
still trying to prove he's a good cop.</i>

45:59.960 --> 46:01.792
Hey, Dex.
<i>Hey.</i>

46:02.000 --> 46:05.357
Look, this is probably
none of my business,

46:05.560 --> 46:08.280
but I feel like I should
tell you about Quinn.

46:08.960 --> 46:09.996
Okay.

46:10.240 --> 46:12.197
He thinks you're gonna
break up with him.

46:12.400 --> 46:13.800
<i>Break up with him? Why?</i>

46:14.040 --> 46:15.838
Because he didn't make sergeant.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.069
That's crazy.

46:18.280 --> 46:19.430
Why would he think that?

46:19.640 --> 46:23.714
Maybe you should, um, invite him over.
I think he's feeling pretty down.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.758
<i>Yeah. Yeah, of course.</i>

46:26.240 --> 46:29.392
Thanks, Dex, for calling.
That really is so sweet of you.

46:29.640 --> 46:30.790
Sure.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.280
<i>Quinn problem solved.</i>

46:55.040 --> 46:56.110
<i>And there's Sofia.</i>

47:04.040 --> 47:05.633
<i>Zach's father.</i>

47:07.000 --> 47:11.199
<i>Sofia is Hamilton's mistress,
just like Norma before her.</i>

47:38.480 --> 47:40.437
<i>What is he doing?</i>

48:12.640 --> 48:13.790
Hey.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.559
I know what you're doing.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.955
Quinn.

48:17.640 --> 48:20.109
You playing detective?
Watching Zach?

48:22.440 --> 48:23.794
Yeah, you caught me.

48:24.040 --> 48:27.477
I'm going to see Jamie.
Keep an eye on Zach.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.434
Jesus. What the fuck?

48:38.680 --> 48:40.512
What are you doing?

48:43.320 --> 48:45.676
Why were you going
to kill your father?

48:45.880 --> 48:49.396
What? I wasn't trying to kill my--
I know you killed Norma Rivera.

48:49.600 --> 48:53.230
I thought you were going to kill Sofia,
but you were going after your father.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.159
Why?
You're crazy.

48:55.360 --> 48:57.875
I didn't try and kill my father.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.194
You tell me one more lie,
and I'll kill you.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.793
I had to.

49:05.040 --> 49:07.191
Why?
Because he's killing my mother.

49:08.360 --> 49:11.432
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.797
Over the years,
one affair after another,

49:14.000 --> 49:16.560
and he doesn't
even try and hide it.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.152
I thought killing Norma
would put an end to it,

49:19.320 --> 49:21.232
but two days later,

49:21.440 --> 49:23.557
he's banging some hostess
from the club.

49:25.040 --> 49:26.713
I knew if I wanted it to stop,

49:26.920 --> 49:29.116
I had to kill Dad.

49:31.640 --> 49:33.791
So that's what this is all about,

49:34.000 --> 49:36.469
you trying to protect your mother?

49:36.800 --> 49:38.473
You actually care about her?

49:39.120 --> 49:41.351
Of course I do. She's my mother.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.438
But showing up at crime scenes,

49:49.560 --> 49:51.836
accidents,

49:53.080 --> 49:54.753
taking pictures of all the blood.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.792
This is about more than
just your mother.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.559
No, I had to protect her.

49:58.800 --> 50:01.190
Yeah, I believe you.

50:01.640 --> 50:04.030
But you killed because you want to kill.
No.

50:04.360 --> 50:06.272
Yes.

50:08.200 --> 50:10.760
To take a living person

50:11.680 --> 50:13.751
and make them dead,

50:15.720 --> 50:18.713
imagining that you can
actually hear the moment

50:18.920 --> 50:21.310
when their heart stops beating,

50:22.280 --> 50:25.876
smell the blood
as it pools across the floor.

50:30.960 --> 50:32.872
I can't help it.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.960
It just builds up inside me

50:39.280 --> 50:41.272
all these years.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.234
But Norma was the first time
I ever followed through.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.318
And how was it,

50:46.960 --> 50:48.440
once you'd killed her?

50:50.600 --> 50:54.116
It felt like this huge weight

50:54.360 --> 50:56.636
was lifted off my chest,

50:56.840 --> 51:02.154
this release of something
horrible inside me.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.435
Like you were finally in control.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.279
Yes.

51:15.480 --> 51:17.949
You should just
go ahead and kill me.

51:19.960 --> 51:20.996
Why?

51:21.200 --> 51:23.840
Because if you don't,
I know I'll do it again.

51:27.000 --> 51:31.279
I don't want to be like this,
but I can't help it.

51:33.040 --> 51:34.679
I just am.

51:34.880 --> 51:36.872
I'm some kind of freak.

51:37.080 --> 51:38.799
A monster.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.234
Yes.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.872
You haven't told anyone else
about this?

51:46.120 --> 51:48.077
Besides Dr. Vogel.

51:48.280 --> 51:50.920
No, I couldn't.

51:51.480 --> 51:53.949
You never had a Harry.

51:55.040 --> 51:56.713
A what?

51:57.200 --> 51:59.396
Someone to talk to.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.957
Someone to teach you.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.396
<i>Some things happen to us
by accident.</i>

52:10.640 --> 52:13.792
<i>Others are choices.</i>

52:14.280 --> 52:17.352
<i>There are parts of me that I can
never share with my own son.</i>

52:17.560 --> 52:19.438
<i>But with Zach,</i>

52:19.960 --> 52:21.838
<i>could I teach him?</i>

52:22.040 --> 52:24.077
<i>Am I ready for this,</i>

52:24.320 --> 52:27.199
<i>to be a spiritual father?</i>

52:30.520 --> 52:34.400
So how'd your sting go with Elway?

52:36.160 --> 52:37.958
Terribly.

52:38.680 --> 52:40.433
Didn't work out?

52:41.040 --> 52:43.430
No, it worked out fine, but--

52:44.040 --> 52:45.633
What?

52:48.480 --> 52:50.233
He likes me.

52:50.600 --> 52:52.034
Oh.

52:52.640 --> 52:53.790
That's a bad thing?

52:54.000 --> 52:57.516
Well, he likes me because he doesn't
know a fucking thing about me.

52:58.400 --> 53:02.474
"Yeah, I killed two people
and tried to kill myself and my brother.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.195
But, sorry, what kind of wine
would you like to order?"

53:05.400 --> 53:08.120
I mean, what the fuck?

53:08.320 --> 53:11.677
Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

53:11.880 --> 53:14.156
How are things with Cassie?

53:15.080 --> 53:16.514
Um...

53:17.360 --> 53:19.477
I don't think there's
much of a future there.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.514
Maybe the Morgans just
aren't meant for relationships.

53:22.760 --> 53:24.797
Yeah, maybe not.

53:27.880 --> 53:29.109
But, hey, life is good.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.755
I'm feeling optimistic
for the first time in a while.

53:31.960 --> 53:34.839
I'm even thinking about
taking on a kind of...

53:35.360 --> 53:36.840
Intern.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.554
Hm...

53:40.920 --> 53:42.877
Well, that's a big step for you, right?

53:43.080 --> 53:47.040
Letting some novice
into your private lab.

53:47.280 --> 53:48.794
Yeah.

53:51.640 --> 53:53.597
Hey, are you okay?

53:53.800 --> 53:55.951
I don't feel so good.

53:56.640 --> 53:58.438
What's wrong?

53:58.800 --> 54:01.076
I feel kind of dizzy.

54:01.280 --> 54:02.634
Deb?

54:08.040 --> 54:09.952
Hello, Dexter.

54:14.000 --> 54:15.957
Remember me?
