WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.403
I'm late. I'm late.

00:03.403 --> 00:05.772
But not so late that
I don't have time
to freak out

00:05.772 --> 00:07.107
and ask what the heck
is going on.

00:07.107 --> 00:10.043
Just trying to start my day
in a civilized manner.

00:10.043 --> 00:12.446
Are you sure you wouldn't
like a little tea, Mr. Wiggles?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.680
Salem, you can dress it up
and call it whatever

00:13.680 --> 00:15.949
emasculating name you want,
but it has to go.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.918
But I want a pet.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.987
I hate to break it to you,
buddy, but you are the pet.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.188
Huh?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.022
I don't think my roommates

00:22.022 --> 00:23.156
are going to find this
little cat and bunny show

00:23.156 --> 00:24.758
within the scope
of their reality.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.226
Morning, Sabrina.

00:26.226 --> 00:27.828
Hi, Roxie. Hi, Harvey.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.129
Cute jacket.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.798
Thanks for the coffee.

00:31.798 --> 00:34.268
Fortunately, she has
her own reality.

00:37.638 --> 00:43.310
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

00:43.310 --> 00:49.750
♪ I'm reaching out
and living by my rules... ♪

00:49.750 --> 00:53.086
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

00:53.086 --> 00:57.791
♪ I wanna make it last... ♪

01:00.127 --> 01:03.463
♪ 'Cause I'm out on my own now ♪

01:03.463 --> 01:08.101
♪ And I like the way it feels. ♪

01:13.807 --> 01:15.375
Fine or ultra fine?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.677
I think I'm going to go
with the ultra fine.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.645
Fine, Leonard.

01:18.645 --> 01:20.147
Right. The ultra fine
is too thin.

01:20.147 --> 01:22.182
No, I mean I don't care
what kind of pens

01:22.182 --> 01:23.016
you pick out
for the office.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.484
This is a huge decision.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.119
One that we are going
to be writing with

01:26.119 --> 01:28.555
for the next few months
of our lives.

01:28.555 --> 01:31.024
I know it's scary,
but just pick a pen

01:31.024 --> 01:31.992
and make a commitment.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.226
But...
No more pen talk.

01:33.226 --> 01:34.094
I just want.
None.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.529
Look, I have a lot
to do, okay?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.832
I don't have time for
any more... distractions.

01:39.833 --> 01:43.103
Unless they're wearing
a leather jacket and have
a perfectly chiseled jaw.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.272
Yeah, yeah, I think
an article

01:45.272 --> 01:47.541
on the band's first
album would be great.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.009
Especially if I'm
the one writing it.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.711
All right, look, you just
tell me what you need, okay?

01:50.711 --> 01:52.746
Launching this band
is my number one priority.

01:52.746 --> 01:56.249
I am completely...

01:56.249 --> 01:57.851
...focused.

01:57.851 --> 01:59.086
Is he still looking?

01:59.086 --> 02:02.422
Yeah. Oh, now
he's smiling.

02:02.689 --> 02:03.523
Now, Cole looks like

02:03.523 --> 02:06.860
he's saying something
a little snotty.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.997
Now he's laughing...
but not too much.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.832
Hey.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.500
He seems awfully friendly.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.035
Well, do you know
who he is?

02:15.035 --> 02:17.137
Uh, no. Oh, but you're
about to find out.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.205
He's coming over here.
Do you want me to go?

02:18.205 --> 02:21.408
No, stay... go... stay...
okay, go.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.176
It's a good thing
you're not a
crossing guard.

02:23.176 --> 02:25.679
No, I mean it, go.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.381
( <i>loud grinding</i> )

02:28.548 --> 02:30.651
You know, you're smoking.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.354
Wow, talk about
your opening lines.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.790
No, I kind of meant
the, um, pen

02:36.790 --> 02:37.658
that you're sharpening.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.694
Oh, uh... now
it's perfect.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.896
Now it's ultra, ultra fine.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.898
Hi. I'm Aaron Jacobs.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.066
Aaron Jacobs,
the band promoter

02:46.066 --> 02:47.968
I've heard so much about
and oh so incorrectly

02:47.968 --> 02:50.303
pictured with a beer belly
and a bad rug?

02:50.303 --> 02:51.638
I'm Sabrina.

02:51.638 --> 02:52.739
Spellman.

02:52.739 --> 02:56.243
The girl whose column
I never miss.

02:56.243 --> 02:57.878
Nice to finally meet you.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.579
I'm sorry if my hands
are kind of sweaty.

02:59.579 --> 03:03.150
Um, I was just flexing one
of those exercise thingies.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.485
It's okay, my, um, heart
is beating so fast

03:05.485 --> 03:07.421
I didn't really notice.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.723
Probably too much caffeine.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.993
I love your writing...
I love your band...

03:12.993 --> 03:14.428
I just wanted to, um...

03:14.428 --> 03:16.797
tell you that I'm
a big fan of your writing.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.066
You know, it's, um, honest.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.967
Oh, well, I try.

03:20.967 --> 03:23.670
You know, my motto
is "Gimme Some Truth."

03:23.670 --> 03:26.306
John Lennon song, right?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.475
Sounds like we might
have a lot in common.

03:28.475 --> 03:30.444
I mean, at least musically
speaking.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.646
Oh, I'm betting way more
than musically.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.881
Ooh, is it hot in here.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.384
Well, look, you've, uh,
probably got a lot to do

03:37.384 --> 03:41.521
now that your, uh, pen
is ready to go, so...

03:41.521 --> 03:41.988
you know,
I was wondering...

03:41.988 --> 03:43.557
Whoa, is that
the time?

03:43.557 --> 03:45.525
You know, I'm
supposed to, um...

03:45.525 --> 03:47.761
There's people, you know?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.329
And it was very nice...

03:49.329 --> 03:50.297
Got to go.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.868
FYI--

03:54.868 --> 03:57.604
she's not interested
in charm and good looks.

03:57.604 --> 04:00.841
Trust me, or she'd
already be taken.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.145
ROXIE:
You ran out without him?

04:05.145 --> 04:07.614
That is so not how this
story is supposed to end.

04:07.614 --> 04:08.882
I'm telling you,
I don't know
what happened.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.350
I just panicked.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.886
Well, if you want my
professional dating opinion,

04:12.886 --> 04:15.388
you're an idiot.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.390
Going with Big Red
on this one.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.293
My head, my mouth, my heart,
they were all out of control.

04:20.293 --> 04:23.864
I think my feet just assessed
the situation and screamed fire.

04:23.864 --> 04:27.033
Sabrina, that sweaty-palmed,
heart-racing,

04:27.033 --> 04:30.237
stomach-in-your-throat feeling
is what dating is all about.

04:30.237 --> 04:31.872
That and a free dinner.

04:31.872 --> 04:32.739
She's right,
sort of.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.509
You know, I'm not a big
believer of love at first sight

04:35.509 --> 04:37.744
but that sounds exactly
like what this is.

04:37.744 --> 04:39.412
You owe it to yourself
to find out.

04:39.412 --> 04:41.081
I don't know.
You guys weren't there.

04:41.081 --> 04:44.151
There's something about him
that just wasn't right.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.753
Not right is you talking
yourself out of liking

04:46.753 --> 04:50.657
this guy because he has
some mythical host
of unknown problems.

04:50.657 --> 04:52.626
You know, she does
that all the time.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.529
Okay, the ganging up thing--
a little annoying.

04:55.529 --> 04:55.962
All right, maybe

04:55.962 --> 04:56.830
I overreacted.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.266
I mean, if the fates ever
throw us together again

04:59.266 --> 05:02.235
and he asks me out,
I'll go.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.306
The fates have a very
twisted sense of humor.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.407
That's him.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.142
Don't look!

05:11.978 --> 05:13.580
Here he comes.

05:13.747 --> 05:17.150
Oh, my God.
I'm getting a zit.

05:18.385 --> 05:21.054
SABRINA:
<i>Maybe he is the one.</i>

05:22.122 --> 05:24.858
<i>And this is how I always</i>
<i>pictured it would be.</i>

05:24.858 --> 05:29.396
<i>It's like time is</i>
<i>standing still.</i>

05:29.396 --> 05:30.964
Wait a minute...

05:30.964 --> 05:32.866
time really is
standing still.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.967
And I did it.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.101
Why did I do that?

05:35.101 --> 05:36.570
Maybe I'm sensing danger.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.338
Maybe I'm supposed
to protect myself.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.106
Maybe I should stop
talking to myself.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.944
Hi.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.646
I'm not quite sure
what happened this afternoon

05:46.646 --> 05:48.982
but, um, I promised myself

05:48.982 --> 05:50.717
if the fates ever
threw us together again...

05:50.717 --> 05:51.518
I got to go.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.657
You've got to admit,
she's quick.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.559
And don't take it
too personally.

05:59.559 --> 06:03.830
You know, fast unexplained exits
are kind of her specialty.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.766
Ah, I was right.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.501
When a witch perceives
extraordinary danger,

06:08.501 --> 06:11.071
time may freeze so she can
assess the situation and escape.

06:11.071 --> 06:14.407
To Tahiti with a cat.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.575
Worth a shot.

06:15.709 --> 06:18.645
You know, it doesn't actually
say he's a threat.

06:18.645 --> 06:21.014
Well, I just have to figure out
why I'm so scared of Aaron.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.549
I got it. Call him up.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.384
Meet for coffee,
catch a flick.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.319
Look, I stopped time.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.188
Clearly, something is amiss.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.556
Oh, here. Here's a spell
to figure out

06:29.556 --> 06:31.224
what makes
somebody tick.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.659
"To know a person's intentions

06:32.659 --> 06:36.229
gather something from their
head, mouth and heart."

06:36.229 --> 06:38.431
Okay, head, mouth
and heart.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.400
Where's my, uh...?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.803
Oh, never mind.
You can keep it.

06:46.539 --> 06:47.407
Hi and bye.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.610
You know, if this is about
overwatering the plants,

06:50.610 --> 06:52.412
I swear I did it
out of love.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.180
Sabrina, this is a
dating intervention.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.782
Aaron seems like
a great guy.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.550
Yeah, what is wrong with you?

06:57.984 --> 06:59.586
Handsome, smart and funny

06:59.586 --> 07:01.755
is like winning
the dating lottery

07:01.755 --> 07:04.024
without having to stand
on line with poor people.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.692
You haven't really
dated anyone
since Josh.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.527
We're beginning to think
you've forgotten how.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.163
Whoa. Have either of you
actually talked to him?

07:10.163 --> 07:11.831
I mean, do you know
anything about him?

07:11.831 --> 07:13.667
Let's just say he wasn't
super chatty

07:13.667 --> 07:15.902
after your most
recent dine-and-dash.

07:15.902 --> 07:17.237
Besides, those are
all things you learn

07:17.237 --> 07:18.838
by actually going
on a date with someone.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.240
Look, I know you guys mean well

07:20.240 --> 07:23.009
but you're going to have
to trust me on this one.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.211
Ever feel like you're only
getting half the story?

07:25.211 --> 07:27.847
Every other day
of my life.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.386
Something from his head.

07:33.853 --> 07:36.022
It's been almost a year
since we broke up,

07:36.022 --> 07:37.524
but she still calls.

07:37.524 --> 07:39.893
Not over your ex yet,
eh, sonny boy?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.094
How typical.

07:41.094 --> 07:41.561
I beg your pardon?

07:41.561 --> 07:44.631
Uh, just making
conversation.
Hold still.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.231
Oops.

07:45.231 --> 07:46.399
Oops?!

07:46.399 --> 07:47.934
Well, you know, in my defense

07:47.934 --> 07:50.103
I did tell you to hold still.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.474
Something from his mouth.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.811
Fillings? Tongue? Spit?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.179
Ouch, ouch and gross.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.113
Hey, James,

08:00.113 --> 08:01.715
if you hypothetically

08:01.715 --> 08:03.817
had to get something
from somebody's mouth

08:03.817 --> 08:05.919
for a way out of control
scavenger hunt,

08:05.919 --> 08:06.653
what would it be?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.054
Well, I know what
you'd get from my mouth.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.990
Probably a lot of words
you wouldn't want to hear

08:09.990 --> 08:13.226
like what kind of stupid
question is that?

08:13.226 --> 08:13.960
Was that helpful?

08:13.960 --> 08:14.995
Not at all.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.196
I tried.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.665
Finally. It's about
time, man.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.234
Got those contact sheets?

08:21.968 --> 08:24.504
Don't forget to drop off
contact sheets at <i>Scorch.</i>

08:27.640 --> 08:28.608
You got it bad, man.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.744
That's...

08:31.511 --> 08:33.246
She was right here
two seconds ago.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.781
Yeah, that's okay.

08:34.781 --> 08:37.250
I seem to have
that effect on her.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.858
Uh, top of the list
for the scavenger hunt--

08:44.858 --> 08:46.292
chewed gum.

08:49.462 --> 08:51.431
Okay, now something
from his heart...

08:51.431 --> 08:54.601
or as they say in español,
el hearto.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.569
I don't know about
this place, Aaron.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.272
There's a serious
cheese factor going on.

08:59.272 --> 09:00.473
Really? I think it's great.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.808
You know, it's so retro.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.376
Kind of reminds me
of <i>Happy Days.</i>

09:03.376 --> 09:04.477
I love that show.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.912
That'll do.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.781
Olé... ter.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.684
So, you still chasing
that writer chick?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.653
Hey, any girl who
looks like that

09:13.653 --> 09:16.623
and can quote Lennon,
she's the girl for me.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.392
Hi. Normally I don't
interfere with my friend's lives

09:19.392 --> 09:24.097
but I think I'm about
to make a big exception.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.331
I just have to mix
this all together

09:25.331 --> 09:27.333
and I'll finally know
what makes Aaron tick.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.035
Something from his head--
a lock of hair.

09:29.035 --> 09:32.038
Something from his mouth--
words he spoke.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.841
And something from his heart...

09:35.308 --> 09:37.911
He really loved
your show, Potsie.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.245
Thanks, Mrs. C.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.616
Cool. What makes him tick.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.018
A watch, of course.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.387
Hey, look, it even has
his name on the back.

09:47.387 --> 09:50.623
You know that's
going to make it
impossible to return.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.158
I just have to wind
this sucker up

09:52.158 --> 09:53.693
and I'll finally know
what sinister thoughts

09:53.693 --> 09:56.362
are lurking beneath
that cool, handsome exterior.

09:56.362 --> 09:58.164
Sabrina, we need to talk.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.900
Oh, cute. Salem's
got a pet.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.202
Yeah, and they need
time to bond.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.304
So why don't we talk
in the other room.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.775
Morgan, look,
I'm really busy

10:08.775 --> 10:09.709
so if there's any way
this could wait...

10:09.709 --> 10:11.678
There is not.
It's too important.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.679
Well, then
make it quick.

10:12.679 --> 10:14.714
First of all,
you're missing an earring

10:14.714 --> 10:15.648
and it looks like
something

10:15.648 --> 10:17.717
gnawed a holed
in your sweater.

10:17.717 --> 10:19.018
I love this sweater!

10:19.018 --> 10:21.020
Oh, someone is this close
to becoming stew!

10:21.020 --> 10:22.822
Sabrina, I think that

10:22.822 --> 10:24.390
I am a little more
experienced in

10:24.390 --> 10:25.792
matters of the heart
than you are,

10:25.792 --> 10:27.227
and I really believe
that you are missing

10:27.227 --> 10:29.829
a huge opportunity
with Aaron.

10:29.829 --> 10:30.530
And it's only because
I care about you...

10:30.530 --> 10:32.232
Morgan, you have to trust me.

10:32.232 --> 10:32.665
I mean, there might be

10:32.665 --> 10:34.801
a lot more too this
guy than we know.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.468
Give me two minutes--

10:35.468 --> 10:37.403
I bet we'll be discussing
his prison record.

10:37.403 --> 10:39.405
What? Prison?

10:39.405 --> 10:42.609
Oh, my God, Roxie!

10:42.609 --> 10:43.776
Okay, now let's find out

10:43.776 --> 10:46.112
what makes Aaron...

10:46.112 --> 10:47.313
The watch-- it's gone.

10:47.313 --> 10:47.914
Where is it?

10:47.914 --> 10:49.616
You know the old expression--

10:49.616 --> 10:53.386
"hare today, gone to Maui."

10:55.421 --> 10:58.091
See? This is why
you cannot have a pet.

10:58.892 --> 11:02.629
Okay, where are you,
you furry little pickpocket?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.865
Whoa!

11:05.865 --> 11:07.333
You startled me.

11:07.333 --> 11:07.834
What are you doing here?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.503
You didn't happen to see
a rabbit go by, did you?

11:10.503 --> 11:12.772
Uh, no.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.041
Look, I know this might
seem kind of weird and stalkery

11:15.041 --> 11:17.944
but, you know, I have
on good authority that...

11:19.979 --> 11:21.781
You're going to run
away again, aren't you?

11:21.781 --> 11:23.383
Afraid so.

11:29.789 --> 11:33.326
I swear, rabbit, you'd better
give me back that watch or else!

11:36.729 --> 11:41.100
Whoa. I'm guessing this would
be the "or else."

11:46.706 --> 11:49.776
Nice hole.
Very rustic.

11:49.776 --> 11:51.511
The journey first
you must take.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.046
Love and future
are at stake.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.581
Look, I have spent
way too much time and energy

11:54.581 --> 11:55.782
making that watch, okay?

11:55.782 --> 11:56.950
I've got to figure out
what makes

11:56.950 --> 11:59.519
that tall, hunky stranger
lurking in my house tick.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.221
I don't have time
for your silly magical...

12:01.221 --> 12:02.822
Cookie?

12:02.822 --> 12:03.990
Maybe just one.

12:07.927 --> 12:10.263
( <i>squeaks</i> ):
Hey, come back here!

12:12.765 --> 12:15.268
Whoa, talk about carbo loading.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.606
So how did it go?

12:19.606 --> 12:20.573
Better.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.108
I almost got out
a whole sentence this time

12:22.108 --> 12:23.376
before she ran out of the room.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.078
Well, I know she'll be back.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.013
She's pretty partial to dinner.

12:27.013 --> 12:31.351
Yeah, that may be, but I think
it's time I took the hint.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.385
No, please.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.586
Come in for
a few minutes.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.088
You know you want
to see her again.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.122
Okay, fine.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.657
But I have my dignity.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.260
If she's not back in a week,
I'm out of here.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.730
You know you've
got a big chunk
of hair missing

12:43.730 --> 12:46.065
from the back
of your head?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.505
Hey, baby.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.140
( <i>laughs</i> ):
Nice dress.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.742
You should talk.

12:55.742 --> 12:56.609
James?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.778
I answer to a lot of names,
but James ain't one of them.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.679
Of course you don't.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.481
I mean, you know, why populate
an annoying alternate universe

13:01.481 --> 13:03.149
with annoying people
I already know?

13:03.149 --> 13:05.118
That was rhetorical, right?

13:05.118 --> 13:07.120
Yeah. So, uh,
have you by any chance

13:07.120 --> 13:08.955
seen an exceptionally
spry white rabbit

13:08.955 --> 13:10.823
with a pocket full of
stolen property pass by?

13:10.823 --> 13:12.025
Oh, yeah.

13:12.025 --> 13:14.360
Oh, except he was more
brown and white.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.995
And, you know, he wasn't
so much a rabbit

13:15.995 --> 13:17.830
as he was a tree squirrel.

13:17.830 --> 13:18.097
Come to think of it

13:18.097 --> 13:20.066
that may have been last Tuesday.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.834
Bottom line,
have you seen him or not?

13:21.834 --> 13:23.336
I guess not.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.471
Has anyone ever told you
you're very misleading?

13:25.471 --> 13:27.473
Just this furry little white guy
with a big pocket watch.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.574
So you did see him?

13:28.574 --> 13:30.543
Who?

13:30.543 --> 13:31.844
All right.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.513
He may have mentioned
I had a lot in common

13:33.513 --> 13:34.847
with this watch he was carrying.

13:34.847 --> 13:36.449
You saw the watch?
What did it say?

13:36.449 --> 13:39.485
All I saw was the word
"misleading" on his face.

13:39.485 --> 13:40.453
Aaron is misleading?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.455
Definitely not a quality
you want in a boyfriend.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.290
Ooh. You single?

13:44.290 --> 13:46.526
How about you put me in
a shoe box and take me home?

13:46.526 --> 13:49.762
No. But, uh, I'll look you up
next time I go fishing.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.498
No, Sabrina's lived here
since high school.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.267
So what about you?
Where are you from?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.235
Oh, all over.
We moved around a lot.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.403
Roxie, I am so glad
I found you.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.239
I went all the way
to the diner to warn you...

14:00.239 --> 14:02.909
...not to have the pulled pork.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.444
It's bad.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.478
Uh, okay.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.313
So what else could
I tell you about Sabrina?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.048
What are you doing?

14:09.048 --> 14:10.817
( <i>stammering</i> )

14:10.817 --> 14:13.986
Trying to subtly get you
to come over here.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.956
Excuse me for just one second.

14:18.424 --> 14:19.692
What is he doing here?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.729
Sabrina thinks that
he may have a prison
record or worse.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.796
You're insane.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.399
And I don't mean your normal,
nutty, endearing insane.

14:26.399 --> 14:27.934
He's a great guy.

14:27.934 --> 14:30.903
He's just asking a ton of
questions about Sabrina and...

14:30.903 --> 14:32.805
and being incredibly vague

14:32.805 --> 14:34.974
any time I ask him
about himself.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.110
Who's being endearing now?

14:37.110 --> 14:38.277
Okay, I'll keep
an eye on him.

14:38.277 --> 14:39.445
You try and find Sabrina.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.114
We'll get to
the bottom of this.

14:41.114 --> 14:43.616
And how creepy is it that
he's just hanging out here?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.184
Well, I did invite him
to stay,

14:45.184 --> 14:47.620
but he accepted
awfully quick.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.856
Very suspicious.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.405
Oh, good, good,
another guest has arrived.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.606
No, no, no,
I'm not staying.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.274
I just... Whoa.

15:08.274 --> 15:11.210
Do the names Leonard and Cole
mean anything to you guys?

15:11.210 --> 15:12.412
No, but if they're
coming to our party

15:12.412 --> 15:13.813
they have to bring
their own chairs.

15:13.813 --> 15:16.482
Oh, and cheese.
Cheese would be nice.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.750
Okay, I'm a little
reluctant to ask,

15:17.750 --> 15:18.985
but have you seen
the White Rabbit?

15:18.985 --> 15:20.520
Oh, yes, we know exactly
where he is.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.322
We won't tell you
until you have a cup
of tea with us first.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.624
All right, but it has
to be quick

15:24.624 --> 15:26.092
because I've got company
upstairs...

15:26.092 --> 15:28.261
you know, with a misleading
heart but great hair.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.662
So it has to be
a very small cup.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.464
Sure.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.433
Oh, no, no!

15:33.433 --> 15:34.667
Don't sit there.
Why not?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.737
Well, what if I want
to sit there later?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.972
Wow, self-centered in
two different dimensions.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.374
So, what will it be?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.910
We have black tea, brown tea,
green tea, chamomile,

15:43.910 --> 15:45.578
Darjeeling, jasmine...

15:45.578 --> 15:47.146
Excuse me,
I'm sitting there now.

15:47.146 --> 15:48.581
...oolong, almond,
blackberry, peppermint...

15:48.581 --> 15:50.082
Excuse me,
I'm sitting there now.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.417
All right, pick a tea
and pick a seat!

15:51.417 --> 15:53.653
No, that would require
too much of a commitment.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.354
Commitment is bad.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.356
Very afraid
of commitment are we.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.524
It's just like
the rabbit's watch read.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.861
The watch said
"fear of commitment"?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.062
Plain as day.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.998
It was fairly committed
to its fear of commitment.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.300
Wonderland has been
irritating and perplexing

16:07.300 --> 16:09.101
but at least now I know
what makes Aaron tick.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.970
I mean, who wants to get
involved with somebody

16:10.970 --> 16:12.538
who's misleading
and afraid of commitment?

16:12.538 --> 16:14.207
I'm just trying
to find someone who
won't steal my chair.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.975
Iris, peach,
chrysanthemum, ginger...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.077
( <i>laughs</i> )

16:21.814 --> 16:22.982
Looking for someone?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.451
Sa...? I'm not even
going to ask.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.752
Yes, I'm looking
for someone.

16:26.752 --> 16:28.654
Any idea where the
White Rabbit might be?

16:28.654 --> 16:31.023
Maybe yes, maybe no.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.960
Impressive, but I don't
have a lot of time

16:33.960 --> 16:36.295
for all this double-talk,
riddle-me-this, riddle-me-that

16:36.295 --> 16:37.330
fading in and out business.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.232
It's my best trick.

16:39.232 --> 16:43.836
Want to see my best trick?
It's called Toothless Cheshire.

16:43.836 --> 16:44.904
Point taken.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.772
He's playing croquet
with the queen.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.474
Dang, I always forget.

16:48.474 --> 16:50.943
Whenever you fall into
a parallel fairy tale universe,

16:50.943 --> 16:52.979
always skip ahead
to the last chapter.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.347
Oh, did you see the watch?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.315
Excellent craftsmanship.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.784
But you probably want to know
about the big secret.

16:58.784 --> 17:01.354
Finally we're getting somewhere.
What's the big secret?

17:01.354 --> 17:02.755
How should I know?

17:02.755 --> 17:05.591
It just said "big secret."

17:05.591 --> 17:06.993
Yeah, another thing
I always forget.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.762
Cats-- unhelpful no matter
what story you're telling.

17:09.762 --> 17:10.863
So that's it?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.265
That's all
you have to say

17:12.265 --> 17:14.834
about the last three
years of your life?

17:14.834 --> 17:15.902
You quit MTV,

17:15.902 --> 17:18.538
started your own label,
got into A&R

17:18.538 --> 17:21.307
and now manage a band?

17:21.307 --> 17:23.509
Sounds just
a little sketchy.

17:23.509 --> 17:27.713
Yeah, okay, I think my time here
is just about up.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.815
Oh, not so fast.

17:29.815 --> 17:31.384
What makes you think
you deserve a girl

17:31.384 --> 17:33.486
as special as Sabrina
in the first place?

17:33.486 --> 17:37.723
You know, I'm not uncomfortable
with waiting in silence.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.028
You broke my wicket.

17:42.028 --> 17:43.763
I think you broke
my foot.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.565
Off with her head.
What?

17:45.565 --> 17:47.199
You're kidding, right?
Kind of.

17:47.199 --> 17:48.401
I just like saying it.

17:48.401 --> 17:51.137
So, up for a game of croquet?

17:51.137 --> 17:53.372
Oh, no, I'm not really
one for games.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.841
Although I would be up for
a hand or two of gin rummy.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.310
That's too bad.

17:57.310 --> 18:01.414
Playing games is what really
makes that watch of yours tick.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.949
Aaron's a
game player, too?

18:02.949 --> 18:04.784
You know, this is getting
worse by the character.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.153
Oh, speaking of which,
I thought I might find
the White Rabbit here.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.055
Oh, he's already played through.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.656
But if you can get your ball

18:10.656 --> 18:12.658
to the other end
of the field...

18:12.658 --> 18:14.393
I can see him and be through
with this farce?

18:14.393 --> 18:16.662
That's the game.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.497
A number six flamingo,
diamond boy.

18:18.497 --> 18:20.666
And stand back.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.869
Fore!

18:34.413 --> 18:36.616
Okay, rabbit, what do you
have to say for yourself?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.985
Close your eyes
and touch the tree,

18:38.985 --> 18:41.487
you'll find the watch
you need to see.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.989
For crying out...

18:42.989 --> 18:45.891
You showed the watch to every
caterpillar, cat

18:45.891 --> 18:47.326
and crazed milliner
you come across

18:47.326 --> 18:49.261
but I'm the one
who has to choose?

18:49.261 --> 18:50.563
Fine.

18:53.332 --> 18:54.634
( <i>clock chimes</i> )

18:54.634 --> 18:56.636
Hey, it worked.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.737
"Misleading,

18:57.737 --> 19:00.706
fear of commitment,
games player, big secret."

19:00.706 --> 19:02.808
Happy you do not seem.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.710
Well, I guess part of me
was kind of hoping

19:04.710 --> 19:06.312
that Aaron would turn out
to be a good guy.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.513
But all the awful things

19:07.513 --> 19:11.517
everybody down here told me
about him were true.

19:11.517 --> 19:12.785
What?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.286
This is my watch?

19:14.286 --> 19:16.555
At Salem's request
I made it for thee

19:16.555 --> 19:17.890
with a ring
from your ear,

19:17.890 --> 19:21.494
a pencil and a sweater
you hold so dear.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.361
But I don't understand.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.397
I mean,
sure, I've been misleading

19:24.397 --> 19:26.232
and I guess you can say
I've been playing games

19:26.232 --> 19:27.500
and heaven knows
I have a big secret,

19:27.500 --> 19:32.138
but am I really so afraid of
commitment that I'd stop time?

19:32.538 --> 19:34.006
We must know
our own heart

19:34.006 --> 19:36.909
before we can know
that of another.

19:36.909 --> 19:39.211
Well, I guess I really was
trying to protect myself.

19:39.211 --> 19:41.213
I mean, Aaron is someone
I could totally fall for,

19:41.213 --> 19:43.949
and I just don't want
to get hurt again.

19:43.949 --> 19:44.950
( <i>magical chimes</i> )

19:44.950 --> 19:48.287
The truth, we know,
for it rings so clear.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.223
So what's up with whole Yoda-
Confucius-grasshopper thing?

19:51.223 --> 19:53.359
Eh, the tourists seem
to like it.

19:55.561 --> 19:56.729
Thank goodness
you're finally back.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.130
You were so right
about Aaron.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.332
He's here and there's something
very strange about him.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.601
I don't think
he's the problem.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.876
Hey.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.944
Hi.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.946
Look, I know I owe you
a huge explanation.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.515
But I don't really
have one.

20:16.515 --> 20:19.452
All I can say is
that I'm sorry...

20:19.452 --> 20:21.654
and that I'm scared.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.457
And I didn't mean to
play games with you.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.893
The point is,
I'm not the kind of girl

20:27.893 --> 20:30.563
you should be
running after.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.931
Hey.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.935
Then stop running.

20:40.372 --> 20:41.974
Well, when you
put it like that.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.717
Are you sure you don't
want to at least

20:51.717 --> 20:53.753
take a peek
at Aaron's watch?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.787
Nope.

20:54.787 --> 20:57.623
I want to find out what makes
him tick the old-fashioned way.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.762
You know, you could've told me

21:02.762 --> 21:04.163
that your little
white rabbit friend

21:04.163 --> 21:05.765
was <i>the</i> White Rabbit.

21:05.765 --> 21:09.235
I thought you met him at my
cousin Cheryl's bat mitzvah.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.303
Oh. He looks
different sober.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.539
You know, that was a very nice
thing you did for me.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.475
I just didn't want to see
you making a big mistake.

21:16.475 --> 21:19.912
And it might be nice to
see you in love again.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.580
You're turning into
a real softie.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.948
Promise not
to tell anyone?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.583
Promise.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.319
We're not going
to hug... are we?

21:27.319 --> 21:28.988
No, you're safe.

21:28.988 --> 21:29.822
<i>'Cause I wouldn't mind.</i>
