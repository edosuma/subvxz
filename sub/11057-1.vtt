02:45.595 --> 02:48.223
Watch out!

02:50.733 --> 02:51.495
Sorry.

03:14.523 --> 03:16.582
Yo, what's up with that?

03:16.692 --> 03:20.150
Tommy quit.
Looks like he went out in style.

03:20.263 --> 03:23.596
You know Tommy.
You better steer clear of Bostick today.

03:23.699 --> 03:27.396
Come on, man. I invented the low profile.
I ain't goin' near that.

03:27.503 --> 03:31.166
Hey! Bostick wants to see everybody. Now!

03:31.274 --> 03:35.210
Check it out. Openin' up two miles from here.

03:35.311 --> 03:38.610
Hello, Castle World.
I heard that.

03:38.714 --> 03:43.413
We've survived a recession,
two earthquakes and a health inspector...

03:43.519 --> 03:47.353
Who, despite my many advances,
turned out to be gay.

03:47.423 --> 03:52.122
We're not goin' anywhere. We're gonna stay
right here and compete with Castle World.

03:52.194 --> 03:57.359
I've been providing quality jobs
for this community for over 27 years.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.893
I got an idea.

04:01.037 --> 04:04.336
Why don't you cash out?
Yeah, yeah. Go to Miami,

04:04.440 --> 04:08.570
Get you a Cadillac and
one of them bald-Headed pool boys.

04:12.348 --> 04:15.044
Everybody get to work.

04:15.117 --> 04:17.346
Jamal, you can clean the moat.

04:18.087 --> 04:19.952
Oh, come on...

04:20.055 --> 04:22.149
But first I wanna talk to you.

04:22.258 --> 04:25.716
Damn it, Jamal. Can't you look
outside yourself for two seconds...

04:25.795 --> 04:30.129
And just buckle down and help me?
Why can't you help yourself?

04:30.533 --> 04:35.061
Forget about the community and
"providing' quality jobs" for people.

04:35.338 --> 04:38.068
Take what money you got, and jet.

04:38.941 --> 04:41.341
Book it. You feel me?

04:41.877 --> 04:44.903
Get out. Bye-Bye.

04:45.348 --> 04:47.612
You don't get it, do you?

04:49.185 --> 04:51.312
I had high hopes for you.

04:52.221 --> 04:54.917
Maybe you shouldn't have.

04:56.225 --> 04:58.216
Jamal.

04:58.327 --> 05:01.819
Clean up them battin' helmets
while you're at it.

05:10.272 --> 05:12.672
Urgh! Dang, man!

05:15.244 --> 05:19.442
Man, this is like some
Three Mile lsland, Exxon Valdez shit.

05:19.515 --> 05:21.847
What other choice do we have, man?

05:21.917 --> 05:25.318
In two weeks Castle World's gonna
blow this place out the water.

05:25.388 --> 05:27.948
We apply now,

05:28.691 --> 05:30.784
Avoid the rush.

05:30.893 --> 05:33.487
Oh!
You feel me?

05:33.562 --> 05:36.156
Yes!
Cos I can't keep doin' this, not here.

05:36.265 --> 05:39.359
Oh. All right. OK.

05:39.668 --> 05:42.899
To Castle World!
To Castle World!

05:47.143 --> 05:49.771
And then I go in...
Aah!

05:49.879 --> 05:51.938
You dead.

05:55.351 --> 05:57.478
Hey!

06:01.690 --> 06:05.126
That's gotta be worth a lot of money.
What?

06:06.362 --> 06:09.627
Oh, hold on.
Let me get something to get that out.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.101
Agh!

06:55.478 --> 06:58.072
What the hell...? Hey, Steve!

06:58.914 --> 07:01.280
Mrs. Bostick!

07:01.350 --> 07:03.818
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

07:04.687 --> 07:06.814
The water's cold!

07:24.907 --> 07:27.171
You disturb my peace.

07:27.309 --> 07:29.834
What is your business here?

07:29.912 --> 07:31.971
What the hell?

07:42.958 --> 07:45.449
Oh, all right. I get it.

07:46.729 --> 07:51.530
You had too much to drink, huh?
Opening' party for Castle World?

07:51.600 --> 07:55.559
Oh, you're upset.
I ain't got no beef with you, dog.

07:55.905 --> 07:59.568
Kindly address me with the proper respect.

07:59.675 --> 08:01.836
I am Knolte of Marlboro.

08:04.947 --> 08:08.280
And I am not a dog.

08:15.524 --> 08:19.654
You may not be a dog,
but you may wanna roll over.

08:20.262 --> 08:23.254
Got my suit all soaked up.

08:24.466 --> 08:27.902
Wait a minute. You ain't breathin', man!

08:31.674 --> 08:33.335
Ohh!

08:33.442 --> 08:36.433
He ain't breathin'! Um... 911!

08:36.745 --> 08:39.736
911! White man down!

08:39.847 --> 08:41.679
White man down!

08:41.750 --> 08:43.945
I'm gonna get a little close to your mouth...

08:44.053 --> 08:48.149
So if you wake up and you see
a brother on you, I ain't like that.

08:48.290 --> 08:50.656
It's about gettin' you to breathe.

08:50.726 --> 08:53.718
So bear with me. Ahh!

08:55.364 --> 08:57.958
Here we go. Here.

08:59.001 --> 09:01.094
Oh, damn!

09:01.804 --> 09:04.671
What you been eatin', spoiled nachos?

09:04.740 --> 09:06.435
Wait. Wait, wait!

09:06.508 --> 09:08.738
Uh, where...

09:08.844 --> 09:11.108
Uh... Spray paint.

09:11.213 --> 09:13.647
I ain't gonna spray-Paint you. No!

09:13.716 --> 09:17.015
Ah, hold on.

09:17.086 --> 09:19.145
Here we go.

09:20.656 --> 09:22.715
Bahh!
Agh!

09:29.932 --> 09:31.900
You've saved my life.

09:32.534 --> 09:36.937
Don't mention it.
I owe you... thanks.

09:37.072 --> 09:39.700
Don't even worry about it.
Where do you live, man?

09:39.775 --> 09:41.970
Come on. Here you go. Come on.

09:43.112 --> 09:45.740
This is it?
It is.

09:45.881 --> 09:47.872
What the...?

09:47.950 --> 09:52.478
Whoa, whoa. You got a license
to have animals, man?

09:52.554 --> 09:55.887
This is a big-Ass donkey.
Do you have a license for this?

09:55.958 --> 09:58.722
Homie, may I make a suggestion?

09:58.794 --> 10:04.323
IKEA. Yeah, get you some end tables
and some of them $5 lamps, man.

10:04.466 --> 10:08.402
You know, and a futon. Then you'll be stylin'.

10:08.504 --> 10:12.907
And try to wear somethin' on your feet
that has a little give other than metal.

10:13.108 --> 10:15.702
You know, get you the proper sneaker.

10:17.079 --> 10:19.172
Are you hungry?

10:20.416 --> 10:22.384
What is that, man?

10:22.484 --> 10:25.942
'Tis food.
'Tis road kill, man!

10:26.021 --> 10:28.990
Ugh. You know what?
Get you some food stamps.

10:29.091 --> 10:31.889
Just tell them you doin' bad.
You know what I mean?

10:31.960 --> 10:36.363
You know, if they don't believe you, ask
a social worker to come through your spot,

10:36.432 --> 10:39.595
Check out where are you livin', cos this is...

10:40.636 --> 10:42.695
It's like that, seriously.

10:42.771 --> 10:46.798
And you oughta get yourself
into a shelter, you know?

10:46.909 --> 10:49.104
Try that. So, um...

10:49.178 --> 10:51.646
Thank you for inviting me to your place.

10:52.214 --> 10:53.977
Thank you

10:54.049 --> 10:56.916
For your... conversation.

10:57.186 --> 11:01.646
You thankin' me for talkin' to you?
I am a man reviled for my failings,

11:01.724 --> 11:08.129
For... for I have not served well my queen.

11:09.498 --> 11:11.989
I must be crazy, man.

11:19.541 --> 11:21.702
Here's two bucks. All right?

11:21.777 --> 11:25.110
Get yourself some soap
and, uh, some Tic Tacs.

11:26.515 --> 11:28.608
I'm gonna get up outta here.

11:28.717 --> 11:30.912
Freeway should be that way?

11:31.954 --> 11:34.013
I'll find it.

11:49.505 --> 11:52.702
Brother lost in the woods: not good.

12:17.399 --> 12:20.698
Oh, hell, no! You know you did wrong!

12:24.673 --> 12:28.541
Oh, shit! Castle World?

12:33.882 --> 12:36.350
Mrs Bostick, you're in trouble.

12:41.457 --> 12:45.359
You all seen that?
They tried to run me...

12:46.061 --> 12:48.154
Hold up! Hold up!

12:49.364 --> 12:51.457
Hold up!

12:52.868 --> 12:55.234
Hey, let me see your manager, OK?

12:55.370 --> 12:59.170
I damn near got trampled
by some of them dumb-Ass actors

12:59.274 --> 13:01.265
Takin' their job way too seriously!

13:01.343 --> 13:05.177
Who be ye?
Who be l?

13:05.280 --> 13:08.738
I be stompin' your ass,
you put your hand on me one more again!

13:08.817 --> 13:11.513
OK? I'm from South Central.

13:11.887 --> 13:13.946
Florence and Normandie.

13:14.990 --> 13:17.424
Normandy? A thousand pardons.

13:17.526 --> 13:20.518
We've been awaiting word from Normandy.
Please, enter.

13:20.596 --> 13:23.326
We'll inform the king of your arrival.

13:25.801 --> 13:30.170
That's more like it. That's how brothers
need to be treated, you know?

13:30.239 --> 13:34.005
And talk to your boy,
cos punks jump up to get beat down.

13:35.744 --> 13:37.803
I'll holler!

13:38.514 --> 13:41.506
Whoa. Castle World's got it goin' on:

13:41.583 --> 13:45.383
Horses, costumes, smells...

13:48.757 --> 13:51.453
Hello. Lose the hat, homie.

13:51.793 --> 13:54.921
Thank you for saving our little village.

13:54.997 --> 13:59.195
And such is the legend of the Black Knight.

14:10.812 --> 14:13.679
The princess will look so beautiful!

14:13.749 --> 14:16.343
It will be a wedding for the ages.
Don't you agree?

14:16.418 --> 14:18.579
Yes, but she doesn't love him.

14:18.687 --> 14:20.678
So? She's but a woman.

14:20.756 --> 14:23.725
What if a woman were not
considered just a man's property...

14:23.792 --> 14:26.556
And were free to choose her own husband?

14:26.628 --> 14:29.756
Are you feeling ill?
Let us pray it's not plague.

14:29.831 --> 14:32.322
Should she be bled?
No.

14:32.401 --> 14:35.734
No, I'm quite well. It was just foolish talk.

14:38.907 --> 14:40.372
Oh, damn.

14:44.877 --> 14:47.141
That's what I'm talkin' about.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.574
Uh...

14:55.554 --> 14:57.954
Allow me to introduce myself.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.321
Jamal.

15:01.527 --> 15:03.620
Victoria.

15:07.066 --> 15:11.765
Oh, wait! Uh, look, darlin'.
Don't cheat yourself, treat yourself.

15:11.904 --> 15:13.963
Uh, look, uh...

15:14.840 --> 15:17.775
I, uh, I don't... work here.

15:17.877 --> 15:19.868
Yeah, I'm a talent agent.

15:19.945 --> 15:25.850
I represent, uh, people like...
Mariah... Denzel...

15:26.452 --> 15:29.944
You can call him Zel.
I'll let him know just you gonna call him Zel.

15:30.055 --> 15:34.048
But I gotta tell you... I'm just gonna be
upfront and say it. You are gorgeous.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.590
You glow, girl.

15:36.695 --> 15:38.993
You speak with an unusual tongue.

15:39.098 --> 15:41.896
Oh, no, that's just how
we talk in my neighborhood.

15:41.967 --> 15:45.494
Now, look, first thing we gotta do
is get some pictures taken.

15:45.571 --> 15:48.131
You own a thong?
A what?

15:48.374 --> 15:53.175
OK, never mind. Why don't you just bring
an old pair of drawers and cut the ass out?

15:53.279 --> 15:55.713
You know? So just give me your number.

15:55.781 --> 15:57.578
Seven.

15:57.683 --> 15:59.878
Excuse me?
You asked my number.

15:59.952 --> 16:03.683
I am one of the king's
chambermaids, number seven.

16:03.756 --> 16:06.452
Oh. Well, that must be
your employee number.

16:06.559 --> 16:11.758
No, I was talkin' about your phone number.
Don't worry. I'll write my number down.

16:11.864 --> 16:14.128
Anybody got a pen?

16:18.370 --> 16:21.464
You can read and write?
Yeah.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.668
Who you been datin'? You gotta raise the bar.

16:25.978 --> 16:30.779
Good day, ladies. How are you
feeling today? Wait. I shall tell thee.

16:32.084 --> 16:34.177
Yes.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.345
Very nice.

16:41.794 --> 16:44.092
You especially, my Nubian queen.

16:47.700 --> 16:53.900
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?
Don't you know that's sexual harassment?

16:53.973 --> 16:58.137
Ah! You the idiot that damn near
ran me over, aren't you?

16:58.210 --> 17:01.737
Wait till I find your boss.
He's gonna fire your metallic ass.

17:01.847 --> 17:04.941
You would do well
to mind your tongue, Moor.

17:05.550 --> 17:09.317
Or I will cut it out and feed it to the dogs.

17:16.228 --> 17:18.958
Come here.
Nah, I'm just messin' with you, man.

17:19.064 --> 17:21.931
I ain't no talent agent, so cut the act.

17:22.034 --> 17:26.436
I'm just tryin' to get at her.
Ain't she fine? Watch me work.

17:26.505 --> 17:29.736
Moor! Do you mock me?

17:29.842 --> 17:32.902
The king awaits thee, messenger.

17:32.978 --> 17:35.538
You might want to take a chill pill, all right?

17:35.648 --> 17:37.843
"Do you mock me, Moor?"

17:37.917 --> 17:40.681
Hey, look, your boss
makes you call him "king"?

17:40.753 --> 17:43.051
We gotta talk union.

17:43.122 --> 17:47.525
Yeah, man, that's not right.
We gotta get you a dental plan.

17:49.094 --> 17:53.463
We do apologize, sire. We did not
expect your arrival for several weeks.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.898
How shall I introduce thee?
What do you mean?

17:55.968 --> 17:59.131
Your formal introduction
for your audience with the king.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.398
Formal introduction?

18:05.744 --> 18:08.736
Your Majesty, if I may have your attention?

18:10.416 --> 18:13.044
Starting at small forward,

18:13.118 --> 18:15.678
From lnglewood High,

18:15.754 --> 18:21.090
Two-Time All-County Conference Player

18:38.644 --> 18:42.102
Oh, man! Now, that brings back memories.

18:44.116 --> 18:49.281
You arrive early. My daughter and I
welcome you. What news from Normandy?

18:49.355 --> 18:51.949
Uh... what news?

18:52.057 --> 18:54.150
Well, a couple of drive-Bys.

18:55.127 --> 18:58.062
Other than that, same ol', same ol'.

18:59.465 --> 19:02.127
When will the duke arrive
to take my daughter's hand?

19:02.267 --> 19:07.034
This is a hell of a setup you got here.
I mean, I'm not lyin'. I mean, whoo!

19:07.139 --> 19:11.007
You got to have major coins behind this.
Who's backin' you - Puffy?

19:11.076 --> 19:15.877
Silence, Moor! Tell me,
when will the duke arrive?

19:16.715 --> 19:20.344
Oh, I get it. You wanna see if I can improve.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.210
OK, well, let's see...

19:22.287 --> 19:24.619
The duke will arriveth...

19:24.723 --> 19:30.286
In all his royal pomposity
and splendor on Tuesday.

19:30.562 --> 19:33.827
Tuesday! Ha. That is excellent news.

19:34.099 --> 19:39.059
Ah. Phillip, have the servants ply this
messenger with much food and drink.

19:39.138 --> 19:42.733
And let him lay with any damsel he desires.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.639
Except my daughter, of course.

20:04.463 --> 20:07.489
Can I get a ride back to town?
Oh, an excellent idea.

20:07.566 --> 20:10.057
Phillip, show our guest the grounds.

20:10.135 --> 20:14.902
Allow him rest, and then
we shall ride, and ride we shall.

20:15.407 --> 20:18.171
Oh, ho, ho! This is funky!

20:18.277 --> 20:20.302
Hey, oh!

20:20.412 --> 20:24.576
Y'all got the little cutout
thing like the castles for real.

20:25.717 --> 20:27.981
Hey, how you doin', Miss Darlin'?

20:28.487 --> 20:32.150
Hey, look here.
I'm in the presidential suite. Uh-Huh.

20:33.392 --> 20:35.485
Yeah! Oh, so, I get it.

20:35.561 --> 20:38.394
This is like a theme park and a hotel, right?

20:38.497 --> 20:41.193
Sire?
Y'all got the real brick.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.427
None of that fake stuff, huh?

20:43.535 --> 20:46.902
Oh, man! Oh, man!
Hey, I need to use your bathroom.

20:46.972 --> 20:49.907
Bathroom? What is that, I pray thee?

20:49.975 --> 20:53.342
I gotta drain the...
you know, drain the anaconda.

20:53.412 --> 20:56.575
Ah, the privy.
Yeah. Appreciate it.

20:57.182 --> 21:00.640
Oh, got to go! Got to... Whoo!

21:03.088 --> 21:04.487
Oh!

21:10.963 --> 21:13.090
Oh, damn!

21:13.866 --> 21:17.358
Seriously, you think you're gonna
charge people money to stay here

21:17.469 --> 21:20.267
And wipe their ass with straw?

21:20.339 --> 21:22.534
Ain't gonna happen.

21:23.175 --> 21:26.076
There's doo-Doo on top of the...

21:26.612 --> 21:29.012
Tell me you don't see that shit!

21:29.114 --> 21:31.412
And I mean that literally!

21:32.084 --> 21:34.780
Where's the Texaco?
Texaco?

21:37.523 --> 21:41.425
What's happenin'? Where y'all goin'?
To the beheading.

21:42.427 --> 21:47.831
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.
Y'all went all-Out. Y'all got the...

21:48.967 --> 21:52.801
You said, say what?
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.

21:52.905 --> 21:55.339
Oh, that should be live. Let's check it out.

21:55.407 --> 21:58.001
Remember that little honey I was hollerin' at?

21:58.110 --> 22:00.578
Out the window?
Yeah, yes, yeah!

22:04.950 --> 22:07.043
Hey, that's tight!

22:14.993 --> 22:17.587
Long live our deposed queen!

22:18.664 --> 22:21.155
Power to the people!

22:26.705 --> 22:29.401
Sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt your rehearsal.

22:29.508 --> 22:32.568
Please, proceed, proceed.

22:40.118 --> 22:44.885
Y'all got a head that comes off?
A neck that spurts blood?

22:45.390 --> 22:47.551
Look at the head.

22:47.626 --> 22:50.356
How do they make it look so real?

22:52.130 --> 22:54.826
Oh, because it is real.

23:20.058 --> 23:22.288
You have to calm yourself.

23:22.361 --> 23:26.730
Calm myself?
I was just holdin' a human head!

23:26.865 --> 23:30.858
You'd think you've never seen an execution.
Not lately!

23:30.936 --> 23:33.370
Wait, uh...

23:33.472 --> 23:36.566
OK, all right. What day is it?

23:36.675 --> 23:41.510
Is it Sunday the 5th?
Yes, messenger, I believe it is.

23:41.580 --> 23:43.878
2001?
Two?

23:43.949 --> 23:46.543
It is the Year of our Lord, 1328.

23:48.186 --> 23:51.121
Argh!
The date frightens you?

23:51.490 --> 23:55.017
You think it don't when it does! Oh!

23:55.160 --> 23:56.923
I didn't mean...

23:56.995 --> 23:59.327
OK, let me calm... Let me just relax.

23:59.398 --> 24:02.367
That's what... a seat. It's a...

24:02.701 --> 24:05.932
All right, is this how you use the chair?

24:06.038 --> 24:09.064
OK, cos I don't really know if you should go...

24:12.944 --> 24:15.913
I gotta go!
But leave you cannot!

24:15.981 --> 24:19.246
There's work to be done.
You wear the medallion.

24:19.318 --> 24:21.878
Well, lots of brothers wear medallions.

24:21.953 --> 24:25.684
I got a cousin. He'll wear a manhole cover
if you get a big enough chain.

24:25.757 --> 24:29.318
You gotta put some bling-Bling on it, though.

24:31.563 --> 24:34.396
You're nervous.
Yeah, a little.

24:34.499 --> 24:37.332
Cos this is not...
I don't even know where I'm from.

24:37.402 --> 24:39.563
When I walked in I saw, like, um...

24:39.671 --> 24:42.105
Let me calm your spirits.

24:42.808 --> 24:47.871
Oh, my damn. Y'all really know
how to make a brother feel welcome.

24:47.946 --> 24:50.574
Yeah. Let's make it happen! Huh?

24:50.682 --> 24:53.742
Grab that leg for me right there.
Why do you disrobe?

24:57.422 --> 25:00.152
Um... Well, uh....

25:01.693 --> 25:03.752
I saw you were gettin' out your drawers.

25:03.862 --> 25:07.628
I wanted to show you that
l, too, wear the medallion.

25:11.937 --> 25:15.270
Yeah. You know what? That was my thinkin'.

25:15.340 --> 25:18.867
Cos it looks just like mine right here. See?
Of course.

25:18.944 --> 25:23.244
I'm here to help you kill the king and
return the kingdom to our deposed queen.

25:23.315 --> 25:25.749
Say what?
That's why we wear the medallion.

25:25.884 --> 25:31.948
I was wearing my medallion cos I thought
it looked good with my gear. You know?

25:32.057 --> 25:33.991
So, how will you do it?
Huh?

25:34.092 --> 25:37.960
Poisonous snakes in his chamber,
or drop him off the edge of the earth?

25:38.063 --> 25:42.864
God knows he deserves it, after killing King
John and stealing the throne from our queen.

25:42.934 --> 25:46.392
He left a warning to all those
who might dare oppose him.

25:46.505 --> 25:48.803
What kind of warning?

25:57.015 --> 25:59.677
Oh!

26:01.753 --> 26:03.516
I'll be goin' now. Yeah, I'm just gonna step...

26:04.456 --> 26:07.550
We have a horse ready for you, sire.
The king awaits thee.

26:07.659 --> 26:10.059
Horse?
You said you wanted to ride.

26:11.730 --> 26:12.287
Yeah.

26:12.364 --> 26:15.925
Oh, shit!

26:16.168 --> 26:18.659
He's yours to ride.
Me?

26:23.308 --> 26:28.473
I haven't been, uh...
totally honest to you about who I am.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.680
Oh?

26:30.749 --> 26:32.046
Uh...

26:32.117 --> 26:36.577
I'm not only the duke's official messenger,

26:38.156 --> 26:40.716
But I'm also the court jester.

26:42.394 --> 26:45.056
Messenger and jester.

26:46.097 --> 26:48.258
An odd combination of talents.

26:48.333 --> 26:50.392
Bring him on.

27:06.451 --> 27:08.919
That is funny.

27:10.522 --> 27:11.511
Damn!

28:27.632 --> 28:29.896
King Leo. Bastard.

28:29.968 --> 28:33.028
I've a mind to slice him open
and feed him to the masses.

28:33.104 --> 28:35.868
Soon, brother. Very soon.

28:46.284 --> 28:48.946
Come on, man. Help a brother out.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.905
I admire his commitment.

29:03.009 --> 29:07.446
He's no longer funny,
but he refuses to give up on the joke.

29:09.483 --> 29:12.077
Messenger and jester.

29:12.185 --> 29:14.676
I have great respect for this man.

29:23.597 --> 29:26.589
Does that feel better?
Yeah.

29:28.935 --> 29:32.462
Good. The bloodletting
appears to be working.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.841
What's that?
It's to burn off the leeches.

29:38.912 --> 29:41.005
The what?

29:48.855 --> 29:51.722
Oh! Ah! Agh!

29:57.297 --> 29:59.857
Now I gotta get home. Where's the lake?

30:00.133 --> 30:06.265
Which lake? Where?
The one with the... drunk-Ass homeless guy.

30:06.339 --> 30:08.637
Uh... Knolte.

30:09.543 --> 30:11.511
Knolte?

30:11.578 --> 30:14.445
He's dead.
No, he just smells dead.

30:14.514 --> 30:17.039
Am I interrupting?
Yes.

30:17.484 --> 30:22.080
My apologies. There is a banquet tonight,
and the king requests your presence.

30:22.155 --> 30:24.953
Oh, I don't think I can make that.

30:26.593 --> 30:29.255
My schedule just opened up.

30:31.097 --> 30:32.257
Mmm. Hmm?

30:53.353 --> 30:58.586
Let us celebrate the upcoming union
between my daughter and the Norman duke.

30:59.159 --> 31:01.559
He is coming, isn't he?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.561
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the duke?

31:06.666 --> 31:08.566
Oh, no doubt. He'll be here.

31:08.668 --> 31:14.334
Yeah, the duke, he just likes to stop off,
you know, see the sights and, uh...

31:15.175 --> 31:20.169
Stuckey's. He likes to stop at Stuckey's
because they got a banana pie that he likes.

31:20.280 --> 31:22.840
But he'll be here.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.943
Allow me to carve.

31:47.007 --> 31:49.498
Peas?
Uh, uh...

31:51.745 --> 31:53.804
Uh, please.

31:54.881 --> 31:57.281
I'd like to learn more about your culture.

31:57.384 --> 32:01.286
It is my understanding that
the Normans are excellent dancers.

32:01.354 --> 32:06.223
If you wanna know more about my culture,
remove the dog from the table.

32:06.293 --> 32:11.822
No offense, King, but the thing about dancing
was a very stereotypical thing you said.

32:11.932 --> 32:14.492
So, you cannot dance?
Ahh!

32:16.236 --> 32:20.366
Can I dance? Come on, man.
That's how I get down.

32:21.474 --> 32:23.965
Please, pleasure us with your skills.

32:25.145 --> 32:27.443
Now?
Mmm. Silence!

32:27.547 --> 32:33.452
Servants, clear the floor, so Sky Walker
may demonstrate some fine Norman dancing.

32:38.458 --> 32:39.755
Um...

32:46.333 --> 32:49.461
Time to get the boogie on. Oh, yeah.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.197
Dance well, Moor.

32:56.209 --> 33:00.168
I'm startin' to like
this word "Moor" Iess and less.

33:40.653 --> 33:43.053
Your Kingliness, special request?

33:49.929 --> 33:52.090
OK.

33:52.165 --> 33:55.657
Now, this is a pretty white crowd, OK?
So nothin' too crazy.

33:55.735 --> 33:58.727
OK? My life's dependin' on it.

33:58.972 --> 34:01.099
OK, guys, I'm gonna need a bass line.

34:01.174 --> 34:05.304
So I'm gonna need y'all to help me out here,
cos I got a lot ridin' on this, man.

34:05.412 --> 34:08.677
Cos y'all got the trumpets,
so I'm gonna need y'all...

34:08.748 --> 34:11.444
Sky Walker.
Yeah?

34:11.818 --> 34:15.014
I'm getting impatient.
I got it together.

34:15.088 --> 34:19.422
I just want the music to be crisp.
Cos if it's crisp, you're gonna jam.

34:19.492 --> 34:25.054
All right. Kick the beat, man. I need you to
kick it like a white boy ain't never kicked it!

34:25.130 --> 34:27.257
Kick it. Uh, follow me, OK?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.426
Just, uh, one...

34:30.670 --> 34:32.728
Two.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.766
Three.

34:59.766 --> 35:03.224
Excuse me. Um... y'all gonna get me killed!

35:03.303 --> 35:05.863
Sky Walker!
Uh, yeah?

35:07.640 --> 35:09.699
OK.

35:10.210 --> 35:12.804
We're ready, King. One...

35:14.347 --> 35:16.281
Two.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.508
Three.

38:13.493 --> 38:19.090
I think our jester-Messenger knows not his
place in society. Perhaps he should learn it.

38:23.403 --> 38:26.839
Your tongue was in my mouth,
swimming around like an eel.

38:26.906 --> 38:30.137
Yeah, it's called a French kiss.
From Normandy?

38:30.243 --> 38:33.144
Florence and Normandie.
Show me more of this.

38:33.246 --> 38:36.340
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:39.319 --> 38:42.288
Excuse me. You have
no business with this woman.

38:42.422 --> 38:43.855
She was comin' on to me.

38:43.923 --> 38:47.916
Are you accusing our fair princess
of having an interest in thee?

38:48.027 --> 38:50.723
No, I'm accusing her
of having an interest in me.

38:54.300 --> 38:57.326
Prepare to taste cold steel.

38:57.437 --> 38:59.029
Behold!

39:01.841 --> 39:03.900
Halt, coward!

39:06.279 --> 39:09.009
Dance to the music

39:10.116 --> 39:12.846
Dance to the music

39:27.400 --> 39:28.867
Agh!

39:31.437 --> 39:33.997
Assassins! Seize them!

39:48.121 --> 39:52.353
This is an outrage!
Lord Percival, how could this happen?

39:52.458 --> 39:57.327
I would be dead right now
were it not for the heroics of Sky Walker.

39:57.430 --> 40:01.764
That's very nice of you, King,
but we do what we can do.

40:03.136 --> 40:05.832
Hey, look. Please, allow me.

40:05.905 --> 40:08.271
Lighten up on Percy, OK?

40:08.341 --> 40:11.708
Let's show a little mercy for Percy.

40:11.778 --> 40:15.179
Everyone is entitled to one enormous,

40:15.281 --> 40:19.047
Near-Fatal, catastrophic disaster.

40:19.552 --> 40:22.316
Ain't that right, Percy?
Sky Walker,

40:22.388 --> 40:27.485
Allow me to honor you by appointing you
a lord of my court, in charge of security.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.552
What?! My Liege...
The king is talkin'.

40:30.663 --> 40:33.291
Now, that's rude, Percy.

40:33.366 --> 40:38.269
But I guess that's how you were brought up.
Now, you were saying, Your Magnitude?

40:38.337 --> 40:41.670
Yes, as I was saying, is there
some way I could prevail upon you

40:41.741 --> 40:44.904
To stay awhile and
become a lord of my court?

40:44.977 --> 40:47.969
Lord of the court? What comes with that?

40:49.182 --> 40:51.878
Well, I would give you 60 hectares of land...

40:54.720 --> 40:57.621
With 20 men to till it.
Farming?

40:58.891 --> 41:04.124
No, I gotta think about that awhile.
I would also give you women for your bed.

41:04.230 --> 41:08.223
As many as you need.
I've reached my decision.

41:08.501 --> 41:11.436
His Lordship, Sir Sky Walker!

41:13.773 --> 41:16.298
What's up, homie? You straight? Cool.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.037
Um... I decided to stay.

41:19.111 --> 41:22.342
Now, I got an idea how
to make some serious coin.

41:22.882 --> 41:26.943
Have you ever had a Frappuccino?
No? Check this out.

41:32.959 --> 41:35.951
What is it?
Jamal-In-The-Box, man.

41:36.062 --> 41:41.159
Yeah, the first of many. And the good
thing is, it's gonna have a ride-Through.

41:41.267 --> 41:43.997
Yeah, you just gallop up, place your order,

41:44.103 --> 41:46.594
And in seconds, you're outta there,

41:46.939 --> 41:50.272
Killin' and plundering.
Excellent work.

41:50.343 --> 41:53.141
Now, I had my royal tailor whip this up.

42:04.457 --> 42:05.481
Yeah!

42:06.826 --> 42:09.420
Hey, hey, pay attention. See this?

42:12.565 --> 42:17.161
This is my official Sky Walker logo. Yeah.

42:17.904 --> 42:19.963
Whoo! Yes!

42:21.474 --> 42:23.533
Damn, y'all catch on quick.

42:24.877 --> 42:26.970
What do we have here?

42:29.916 --> 42:32.851
Look like you can use some help.

42:32.919 --> 42:37.515
If you think I need help,
you do not understand the game, Moor.

42:37.657 --> 42:40.751
Moor? Well, I prefer "Lordship."

42:41.160 --> 42:43.560
Do you mind?

42:45.531 --> 42:47.590
All right. Excuse me.

42:48.568 --> 42:50.559
All right.

42:51.003 --> 42:52.664
Oh.

42:52.738 --> 42:55.730
To win this game,
you're gonna need your knights.

42:55.808 --> 42:59.471
And you might wanna
leave your rim pawns at home.

42:59.545 --> 43:03.003
Yeah. That's your ass.

43:03.215 --> 43:06.742
Sometimes the queen has to be sacrificed
for the good of the kingdom.

43:06.886 --> 43:09.946
Yeah, but every pawn is a potential queen.

43:10.056 --> 43:13.048
You turn your back,
she'll bite you in your ass.

43:13.359 --> 43:16.453
I don't intend to let the game last that long.

43:18.464 --> 43:20.557
Checkmate.

43:25.338 --> 43:27.932
We should get together
and play again sometime.

43:28.040 --> 43:30.338
I'm sure we will.

43:34.981 --> 43:37.074
Mind your back, Moor.

43:38.351 --> 43:41.514
Lord Sky Walker,
the king demands your presence!

43:41.787 --> 43:43.880
Excuse me there, cuz.

43:43.956 --> 43:47.790
Hey, Your Kingliness.
What's up, big homie? What's happenin'?

43:47.927 --> 43:50.932
Were you not to consult
on issues of security?

43:51.566 --> 43:54.262
Uh... yeah.

43:54.336 --> 43:57.430
Why, what happened?
I was out for a ride with my men.

43:57.506 --> 44:03.069
One of my soldiers caught this peasant
stealing a turnip from the castle garden.

44:05.714 --> 44:08.581
Sire, I beg your forgiveness.

44:09.318 --> 44:12.879
I only did it to feed my starvin' family,
for we are...

44:12.988 --> 44:18.255
Silence. Round up his starving family,
take them all away for execution.

44:19.728 --> 44:21.195
You...

44:21.463 --> 44:23.727
Man just said...

44:27.669 --> 44:30.467
How much did you take?
Only a turnip.

44:33.642 --> 44:35.405
Come on!

44:43.752 --> 44:46.050
And Sky Walker?
Yeah?

44:46.121 --> 44:50.080
We are still waiting on your duke.
My patience is wearing thin.

44:50.759 --> 44:53.284
Yes, Y-Your Fabulousness.

44:54.730 --> 44:58.222
I'm gonna handle a little somethin'.
Get your ass up!

44:58.533 --> 45:00.967
That's the king. Take a good look at him.

45:01.103 --> 45:03.162
Say "King, I'm sorry"!
King, I'm sorry!

45:03.238 --> 45:05.297
King, I apologize!
King, I apologize!

45:05.407 --> 45:08.865
King, that's my ass!
King, that's my ass!

45:09.678 --> 45:13.444
That's your ass. Watch out!
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!

45:14.883 --> 45:17.044
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!

45:17.119 --> 45:20.247
Why you bring the mean out in me?!

45:20.322 --> 45:24.053
That's the king, and you're gonna
be punished! Punished severely!

45:24.126 --> 45:26.458
With these coins.
Huh?

45:27.596 --> 45:30.064
OK, go. Get outta here. Go.

45:30.132 --> 45:32.464
Here, take the bag too. Go!

45:33.335 --> 45:35.530
You're free. Go!

45:35.637 --> 45:37.696
Get out. Go.

45:38.540 --> 45:42.806
With the compliments of the king, it is
his pleasure to share with Lord Sky Walker

45:42.878 --> 45:46.746
His booty.
Booty, as in "spoils of war"?

45:48.750 --> 45:50.718
Oh, that booty.

45:51.686 --> 45:53.813
Good night.

45:58.093 --> 45:59.822
Whoo!

46:00.128 --> 46:02.460
Let's get it over with.

46:02.597 --> 46:05.657
You asked to have me delivered to you?
Yeah, so we can talk.

46:05.767 --> 46:07.894
Mm-Hm!
No, seriously.

46:09.504 --> 46:13.270
Um... if you're not naked, they may hear us.

46:16.445 --> 46:19.903
Uh... Iet me break it down for you.

46:20.282 --> 46:24.480
I asked him to bring you here for this
so they wouldn't get suspicious.

46:24.586 --> 46:29.387
Now, we gotta act like we're doin' the do, OK?
Cos the guard's right out front. Uh...

46:29.891 --> 46:32.052
Oh! Oh, yeah!

46:32.127 --> 46:35.062
Oh! Oh, girl! Yeah, there it is.

46:35.130 --> 46:39.863
Oh! Ooh! Oh, remind me
to thank the king! Whoo!

46:42.471 --> 46:44.405
Uh...

46:44.473 --> 46:47.704
Sire, you're hung like a horse!

46:52.714 --> 46:55.080
Oh! Oh!

46:55.317 --> 46:56.409
Oh!

46:56.885 --> 47:00.116
Work with me. The king is crazy.

47:00.255 --> 47:03.053
He's killing people over vegetables.

47:03.158 --> 47:06.753
So you'll help with the rebellion?
Oh, no, I got to get outta here.

47:06.828 --> 47:10.389
If the real messenger shows up
they'll slice me up like Wonder Bread.

47:10.465 --> 47:13.366
But you wear the medallion.
You're a man with honor.

47:13.435 --> 47:16.495
And as lord, you now have
even greater access to the king.

47:16.605 --> 47:18.300
Ohh!

47:19.441 --> 47:20.635
Good.

47:20.709 --> 47:23.610
Ohh!

47:24.412 --> 47:26.880
Whoo! Put that up right there.

47:26.982 --> 47:29.780
Now hold that right there. Whoo!

47:31.086 --> 47:34.886
Look, I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.

47:37.492 --> 47:40.325
Then I have nothing more to say to you.

47:40.428 --> 47:42.692
And that is how I break it down.

47:48.036 --> 47:50.869
She's quite a spirited one, eh, sire?

47:51.006 --> 47:54.305
Whoo! Where did y'all get her?

47:55.110 --> 47:57.408
Oh! One in a million.

48:32.814 --> 48:36.181
I was hopin' you'd come back
to say good night.

48:49.831 --> 48:51.992
Halt!

48:52.300 --> 48:56.999
I am Jobert of Normandy,
with a message from the Duke DuBois.

49:12.954 --> 49:15.354
Sky Walker.
Hm?

49:15.423 --> 49:17.084
Oh!

49:19.294 --> 49:21.353
Regina?
Regina?!

49:21.463 --> 49:25.331
What are you doin' here?
You dare to deflower the king's daughter?

49:25.433 --> 49:28.834
Somebody got to that flower
long before I did.

49:29.070 --> 49:30.799
You need to know...

49:30.872 --> 49:34.000
Your daughter's a freak.
Ohh!

49:35.744 --> 49:40.738
The girl has been soiled.
The duke will no longer be interested in...

49:42.450 --> 49:47.752
The duke will no longer be interested in
your daughter's hand in marriage. Good day.

49:47.856 --> 49:50.416
You have not only tarnished my daughter,

49:50.492 --> 49:53.052
But any chance of an alliance with Normandy!

49:53.128 --> 49:57.428
He'll pay for this.
Well, what if I was to say,

49:57.499 --> 49:59.660
In all seriousness,

49:59.734 --> 50:02.760
That I'm really, really sorry?

50:06.675 --> 50:08.734
Oh, we misjudged you, Sky Walker.

50:08.843 --> 50:12.779
When you foiled our assassination attempt
and doomed us to execution...

50:12.881 --> 50:15.179
We were a little peeved.
To say the least.

50:15.283 --> 50:17.911
But now, seeing your plan unfold...

50:18.953 --> 50:21.649
Genius.
My plan?

50:23.091 --> 50:26.356
Oh. Well, yeah. Well...

50:27.262 --> 50:28.889
Uh...

50:28.963 --> 50:31.761
Well, I don't like to be obvious, you know?

50:31.866 --> 50:35.461
My plan, it just creeps up on ya.

50:35.537 --> 50:38.370
Yes. Had the king united with Normandy,

50:38.473 --> 50:40.907
Our rebels could never have defeated them.

50:40.975 --> 50:44.877
Because you deflowered the princess,
Leo cannot form his alliance.

50:44.946 --> 50:47.346
Your action has given us hope.

50:47.415 --> 50:50.748
With luck, we can restore
our queen in hiding to the throne.

50:50.819 --> 50:54.346
Sounds like that's a good plan.
It's a perfect plan.

50:54.422 --> 50:57.550
Our deaths will not be in vain.
Well, good, good.

50:58.026 --> 51:01.291
Death?! Ain't nobody dyin' here!

51:01.730 --> 51:04.824
Ah, that white girl came on to me!

51:04.899 --> 51:07.732
We're all going to be put to death tomorrow.

51:07.836 --> 51:11.328
You can bloody well bet those
bastards are sharpening the ax.

51:11.439 --> 51:13.669
At least, I hope they're sharpening it.

51:13.742 --> 51:18.179
I saw it done with a blunt ax once.
Took all day.

51:18.379 --> 51:21.542
Just hacking... and hacking

51:22.183 --> 51:24.743
And hacking... and hacking...

51:24.853 --> 51:26.878
We get it, man!

51:28.123 --> 51:30.489
If only the Black Knight were here.
Who?

51:30.792 --> 51:34.455
You never heard of the Black Knight?
You ever heard of Shaq?

51:36.598 --> 51:39.123
We're even.

51:39.200 --> 51:41.600
The legend of the Black Knight...
Legend?

51:41.703 --> 51:44.399
The Black Knight was a great warrior.

51:44.506 --> 51:47.532
Kings tried to buy his might,

51:47.609 --> 51:51.067
But he swore allegiance only to justice.

51:51.179 --> 51:55.343
It is said he was once
swallowed whole by a fierce dragon.

51:55.416 --> 51:59.147
Swallowed whole.
But lo, with a sword of gold,

51:59.220 --> 52:01.950
Did he cut his way from the belly of the beast.

52:02.056 --> 52:06.550
And when he emerged, he himself
could breathe the fire of the dragon.

52:12.901 --> 52:16.895
See, this is why you shouldn't
drink your own urine.

52:20.265 --> 52:21.459
Shit!

52:23.769 --> 52:26.101
Let the execution commence!

52:27.873 --> 52:30.103
Maybe we need a-A...

52:30.208 --> 52:33.700
Should wait for a bigger crowd, OK?
I'm only gonna do this once!

52:33.812 --> 52:35.973
Go forth!
OK. Uh...

52:36.047 --> 52:40.245
They want us to line up
in order of color, light to dark!

52:41.420 --> 52:44.787
You a priest! I pay my tithe. I go to church.

52:44.856 --> 52:48.019
I give up the moola! Ohh!

52:48.093 --> 52:51.324
Wait! Primitives! They're backwards! Um...

52:51.630 --> 52:54.292
Your Kingliness, um, one last word?

52:57.936 --> 52:59.995
Uh...

53:00.071 --> 53:02.062
Well, uh...

53:03.842 --> 53:05.070
Behold!

53:08.480 --> 53:11.472
I am a great sorcerer!

53:14.786 --> 53:17.346
Ooh!

53:17.422 --> 53:19.652
Uh, uh...

53:19.758 --> 53:21.658
Do not anger me!

53:21.760 --> 53:24.786
For with these hands,

53:24.896 --> 53:28.161
I make... fire!

53:30.502 --> 53:33.494
Wait. Uh... fire!

53:36.174 --> 53:38.438
We have fire.

53:39.311 --> 53:40.039
Oh.

53:40.111 --> 53:42.841
Execute him! Now!

53:44.516 --> 53:46.507
No, no!

53:50.856 --> 53:53.051
No!

54:05.770 --> 54:09.729
The sorcerer has cast
a spell of death upon him!

54:09.841 --> 54:11.934
Who?

54:13.211 --> 54:15.441
Yeah! That's right!

54:15.514 --> 54:18.449
I cast a spell of death on him!

54:18.583 --> 54:21.950
But I can bring him back
cos I'm a great sorcerer.

54:23.922 --> 54:26.550
Boogedy-Boogedy-Boogedy!
Agh! Not me!

54:41.439 --> 54:43.669
Behold!

54:43.775 --> 54:46.539
I have somethin' to tell you.

54:46.611 --> 54:51.480
I can make the sun fall from the sky

54:52.050 --> 54:55.417
And burn you medieval motherf...

54:56.454 --> 54:58.217
Fire!

54:58.290 --> 55:00.815
The sun is falling! He'll kill us all!

55:00.892 --> 55:03.622
Fear him not! He is no sorcerer!

55:03.728 --> 55:07.095
He is a charlatan and a jester! Seize him!

55:07.399 --> 55:10.129
This way! Down!

55:16.741 --> 55:18.504
Aagh!

55:25.350 --> 55:27.409
Get in!

55:31.356 --> 55:32.914
Get him!

55:37.228 --> 55:39.355
Come on!
Go!

55:39.431 --> 55:41.194
Yah!

55:50.041 --> 55:52.566
Close the portcullis!

56:05.624 --> 56:10.548
Open it! Open the portcullis!
It's stuck, sire! It won't open!

56:18.757 --> 56:20.987
Sky Walker!
Knolte!

56:25.797 --> 56:27.731
Up we go.

56:29.567 --> 56:31.660
Fifth time's the charm.

56:43.281 --> 56:47.183
You find them... you kill them.

57:01.700 --> 57:04.225
You done this shit before,
haven't you, Knolte?

57:04.302 --> 57:07.738
You saved my life. I simply repaid the debt.

57:07.839 --> 57:11.036
Payin' debt? You were
kickin' ass back there, man.

57:11.109 --> 57:15.239
How'd you get in on this?
Your fair Victoria told me of your plight.

57:15.313 --> 57:20.273
Victoria did this for me?
Well, you and the rebellion.

57:20.352 --> 57:24.083
But, uh... a lot of it was for you.

57:25.490 --> 57:27.151
Yeah, that's all right.

57:45.076 --> 57:47.135
Agh!

57:51.116 --> 57:53.277
I wish you well.

57:53.351 --> 57:57.185
Look, I owe you one.
I got your back, all right?

57:57.288 --> 58:01.281
But if you fall into trouble again,
he will not be there. Will you, Sir Knolte?

58:01.559 --> 58:04.687
Sir Knolte?
I paid my debt and now I must leave.

58:04.763 --> 58:07.926
Knolte was once
one of the greatest knights in England,

58:08.033 --> 58:11.264
Until he fell for Percival's trick
and the queen lost her throne.

58:11.336 --> 58:13.827
That was a long time ago.

58:13.905 --> 58:17.170
I've laid down my sword
and I will not fight again.

58:17.275 --> 58:19.334
Wait. Knolte!

58:20.078 --> 58:21.943
Uh, uh...

58:22.047 --> 58:25.073
But... check this out. Knolte!

58:25.150 --> 58:27.243
Sir Knolte!

58:37.962 --> 58:43.127
I still say we should move camp. It's just luck
Percival's patrols have yet to discover us.

58:43.201 --> 58:48.264
An interesting suggestion. Now here's
another suggestion: serve more gruel.

58:49.908 --> 58:54.470
You know, y'all dead wrong.
You dead wrong. This is a lady here.

58:55.013 --> 58:58.005
Uh, Vicky? I wanna thank you

58:58.116 --> 59:02.610
For helping Sir Knolte save my life.
Actually, the plan was mine.

59:02.687 --> 59:04.746
No shit?
I shit you not.

59:05.090 --> 59:07.888
I had to tell everyone
I'd heard it from a great warrior,

59:07.959 --> 59:10.928
Otherwise no one would have
listened to me, a woman.

59:11.029 --> 59:17.229
So you like me a little more than you...
Did you have a nice time with the princess?

59:17.302 --> 59:20.465
Wait! Look, the only reason
I slept with the princess,

59:20.538 --> 59:24.736
Cos I thought she was you. That's true.
That's the real true bill. True bill. OK?

59:24.843 --> 59:27.277
It was dark, and I had no night-Light.

59:27.345 --> 59:31.645
I'm tellin' you...
Whatever you think I want to hear.

59:32.150 --> 59:35.313
I think all our words have been said.
Hey, Vicky...

59:35.386 --> 59:38.321
I can help you get outta here, way outta here.

59:38.923 --> 59:43.860
Take you to a place where a smart woman
like you can do more than just ladle gruel.

59:43.928 --> 59:48.592
Look, if you show me how to get to the lake,
tomorrow you'll be at Fox Hills Mall

59:48.700 --> 59:52.796
Gettin' your legs waxed.
Huh? Drinkin' mai tais, chillin'.

59:52.904 --> 59:58.206
So what's it gonna be?
Gruel, leprosy, mean-Ass king?

59:59.077 --> 01:00:02.513
Mai tais, chillin', bikini, thong?

01:00:03.581 --> 01:00:07.574
I realize that our backward rebel society
is far from perfect,

01:00:07.685 --> 01:00:10.176
But it's a step in the right direction.

01:00:10.288 --> 01:00:12.483
Now is the eve of our great offensive.

01:00:12.557 --> 01:00:17.221
I can live with losing the good fight,
but I cannot live with not fighting it.

01:00:22.367 --> 01:00:24.961
The lake you seek is that way.

01:00:26.404 --> 01:00:28.269
Safe journey.

01:00:46.624 --> 01:00:48.819
Hey, old sot!

01:00:50.962 --> 01:00:53.055
I have no quarrel with you, sir.

01:00:53.831 --> 01:00:55.958
Finally, the lake.

01:00:57.035 --> 01:01:01.199
Better not come out on the other end
fightin' dinosaurs.

01:01:14.519 --> 01:01:16.578
All right, think, think, think.

01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:27.191
It's not my fight.
Yeah, that's it. It's not my battle.

01:01:27.265 --> 01:01:30.826
That's right, it's...
it is not my battle at all. Yeah.

01:01:30.935 --> 01:01:34.462
So, uh... Iet's do this.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.333
Home sweet home.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:44.344
Perhaps I'll stand you to a drink.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.150
Oh!

01:01:47.952 --> 01:01:49.681
Thank you.

01:01:50.688 --> 01:01:52.781
Bless you.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.911
Man, I think it's time to admit
you have a drinking problem.

01:02:21.552 --> 01:02:25.249
I want my grog back. Pick it up.

01:02:26.658 --> 01:02:31.027
You don't wanna be messin' with me
cos I'm liable to stuff a mud hole in your ass.

01:02:31.129 --> 01:02:33.359
You know?

01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:36.195
It's an insult, dumb-Ass.

01:02:40.805 --> 01:02:43.330
I have killed six men with these.

01:02:46.611 --> 01:02:49.944
What do you move for?
It's called boxing.

01:03:03.528 --> 01:03:05.792
That's called a Rope-A-Dope.

01:03:20.578 --> 01:03:24.014
Look at the footwork! Look at the footwork!

01:03:26.117 --> 01:03:27.550
You know it

01:03:27.618 --> 01:03:32.146
Now let me introduce you to my little friend.

01:03:42.433 --> 01:03:46.335
Knolte! Come on, man.
I know you got my back.

01:03:46.404 --> 01:03:48.804
Knolte is not a fighter.

01:03:48.873 --> 01:03:52.036
He is not even a man!
All right, wait.

01:04:07.492 --> 01:04:09.551
Aaagh!

01:04:19.504 --> 01:04:22.803
Get your ass outta here. That's right.

01:04:23.141 --> 01:04:26.941
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Perhaps there's life in the old dog yet.

01:04:27.011 --> 01:04:31.380
Oh, man! High five.
This is a high five moment.

01:04:31.449 --> 01:04:35.146
Yeah, put your arm up. Right here, like that.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.915
Well, we'll work on that.

01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:43.586
Hey, you bad man.
You put his face in the shit!

01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:48.223
Yes, I did.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.859
Oh, man.

01:04:51.636 --> 01:04:56.039
Hey, Knolte, we was a great team
back there, right? Like Shaq and Kobe.

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.199
Shaq and Kobe?

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:03.674
Well, I'll explain it to you when we
get back to the camp. I loved it, man.

01:05:03.781 --> 01:05:06.341
This... "Rope-A-Dope."

01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:09.909
Could you teach me its mysterious ways?

01:05:12.824 --> 01:05:16.089
You just let your man tire himself out, right?

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.926
He just get the punchin' on you.
Then you like that, while he like this...

01:05:19.997 --> 01:05:23.330
Then he tired, and you ready to really...

01:05:32.944 --> 01:05:36.107
What happened?
Percival's patrols. They found us.

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:39.741
The only men standing are
those of us who were away from camp.

01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:43.378
Damn! Victoria told us this would happen.

01:05:44.121 --> 01:05:46.646
Victoria!
They took her.

01:05:46.791 --> 01:05:49.521
Now she's lost, like our cause.

01:05:49.594 --> 01:05:52.586
Just another bauble in the king's crown.

01:05:55.166 --> 01:06:00.399
Look here, we just gotta rescue her. You
know what I'm saying? Take out the king.

01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:01.938
Uh, uh...

01:06:02.006 --> 01:06:04.099
Who here will fight?

01:06:08.079 --> 01:06:10.570
Who's ready to rumble?

01:06:12.717 --> 01:06:14.776
Nobody?!

01:06:17.822 --> 01:06:19.551
I will.

01:06:24.695 --> 01:06:27.129
That's what I'm talkin' about, Knolte.

01:06:27.198 --> 01:06:31.191
But we are greatly depleted,
both in number and in spirit.

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:33.793
Nothing could inspire them
to ever fight again.

01:06:33.905 --> 01:06:37.705
These men might
fight for their queen.

01:06:40.311 --> 01:06:42.404
The queen.

01:06:56.127 --> 01:06:59.324
What's happenin' now? How you doin'?

01:07:00.932 --> 01:07:02.923
He's French.

01:07:03.534 --> 01:07:05.593
Sir Knolte.

01:07:06.571 --> 01:07:08.766
I am pleased to see you.

01:07:08.873 --> 01:07:11.671
For all this time, I thought you were dead.

01:07:11.742 --> 01:07:14.677
Well, l... was.

01:07:14.745 --> 01:07:16.940
Your Majesty, I was.

01:07:17.782 --> 01:07:20.751
I beg your forgiveness.
I should not have left you alone.

01:07:20.818 --> 01:07:24.310
If you had not, you surely would
have been killed with the others.

01:07:24.388 --> 01:07:27.118
I'm therefore grateful that you did.

01:07:27.224 --> 01:07:33.493
But now that you've returned from the dead,
it is time to return me to my throne.

01:07:33.564 --> 01:07:36.032
Will the men fight again on my behalf?

01:07:36.133 --> 01:07:39.364
Oh! I can answer that. Ain't nothin' happenin'.

01:07:40.237 --> 01:07:43.729
You know? They draggin' ass.
I asked them that same thing.

01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:47.641
They go and act like they ain't hear me,
didn't they, Knolte?

01:07:47.778 --> 01:07:54.206
This is my friend Sky Walker, a man
of unconventional wisdom and courage.

01:07:55.219 --> 01:07:57.346
What do you think, Sky Walker?

01:07:57.421 --> 01:08:01.858
I think they're gonna need a pep talk. You
know what I'm sayin', Your Highnessness?

01:08:01.926 --> 01:08:04.986
They gonna be needin' a major pep talk.
Gotta get up in here.

01:08:05.096 --> 01:08:08.930
My queen could inspire the stars
to fall from the heavens.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.769
Gather the men, that I might give some words
to stir the soul and burn the blood.

01:08:26.951 --> 01:08:32.981
England!

01:08:33.890 --> 01:08:38.419
Sceptered isle of lute and chattel,

01:08:39.196 --> 01:08:42.688
Void your rheum upon my bosom!

01:08:43.734 --> 01:08:48.330
Oh, England!

01:08:48.639 --> 01:08:53.372
I've heard enough.
Oh, England!

01:08:54.211 --> 01:08:56.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:57.113 --> 01:09:01.140
Why don't you let me give it a try?
See if I can give 'em the ol' Al Sharpton.

01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:08.124
Well, uh...

01:09:08.993 --> 01:09:12.656
There once was a great king!

01:09:14.698 --> 01:09:16.962
Rodney King,

01:09:17.068 --> 01:09:20.094
Who said "Ow, ow, ow!"

01:09:20.171 --> 01:09:22.969
"Officer Allen, ow!"

01:09:23.073 --> 01:09:26.339
"Get 'em off... Ow! Bzz! Agh!"

01:09:27.178 --> 01:09:31.979
And who also said
"Can't we all just get along?"

01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:34.544
We need a knight, not a jester.

01:09:34.618 --> 01:09:38.349
I'm gonna go and start diggin' our graves.

01:09:39.223 --> 01:09:43.386
Well, I say sometimes we can't just get along!

01:09:43.493 --> 01:09:46.156
Sometimes we gotta take up arms!

01:09:50.334 --> 01:09:52.198
Look.

01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:55.096
Hear what I'm sayin'.

01:09:56.207 --> 01:09:58.300
Your lives are shitty.

01:09:59.443 --> 01:10:02.435
I know because I've been there.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:05.606
I know the feeling of
waitin' for your ship to come in

01:10:05.716 --> 01:10:09.152
And you're standing
in the middle of the desert.

01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:12.383
Oh, England, you lost your kingdom.

01:10:13.023 --> 01:10:16.550
You live in huts. You look like hell.

01:10:17.795 --> 01:10:20.320
Well, you do! Check your feet out.

01:10:20.397 --> 01:10:23.127
Look at your feet. Mm-Hm, see?

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.159
Restore this lovely queen to her throne.

01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:33.441
Cos when you can do that, she promises
that there will be a horse in every stable,

01:10:33.544 --> 01:10:36.741
A chicken in every pot.
That's right. Mm!

01:10:37.982 --> 01:10:40.280
Can I get an "amen"?

01:10:41.952 --> 01:10:45.285
I said, can I get an "amen"?!

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:47.221
Amen.

01:10:47.291 --> 01:10:50.021
Can I get an "amen"?!

01:10:50.094 --> 01:10:53.063
Amen! Amen!

01:10:53.297 --> 01:10:55.390
King Leo.

01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.862
He thinks he's King Arthur.

01:10:58.969 --> 01:11:01.369
Well, I know King Arthur.

01:11:01.438 --> 01:11:06.432
And you, King Leo, are no King Arthur!

01:11:06.544 --> 01:11:09.104
No King Arthur, indeed!

01:11:09.713 --> 01:11:13.945
No King Arthur! No King Arthur!

01:11:15.386 --> 01:11:20.756
Ask not what your fiefdom could do for you,

01:11:20.825 --> 01:11:24.056
But what you could do for your fiefdom!

01:11:34.633 --> 01:11:37.830
Now, Sir Knolte, bring me back my crown.

01:11:37.936 --> 01:11:39.961
Your Majesty, it will be an honor.

01:11:41.740 --> 01:11:43.207
King Leo got a great big castle..

01:11:43.275 --> 01:11:45.539
King Leo got a great big castle...

01:11:45.611 --> 01:11:47.579
And we're gonna shove it
right up his asshole...

01:11:47.646 --> 01:11:50.012
We're gonna shove it right up his asshole...

01:11:50.082 --> 01:11:52.209
Sound off
One, two...

01:11:52.284 --> 01:11:55.344
Bring it on down.
Huh, huh, huh-Huh

01:12:01.827 --> 01:12:04.489
Yeah, that's tight! Right to the chest.

01:12:05.163 --> 01:12:07.222
I'm lovin' it!
Tight.

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.995
That's tight.

01:12:12.304 --> 01:12:13.965
Yeah, yeah! Get it! Get it!

01:12:17.976 --> 01:12:20.410
Try not to mount his ass next time.

01:12:24.049 --> 01:12:25.175
Ooh! Oh!

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.047
One, two, three. Yes!

01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:31.189
Set!

01:12:31.256 --> 01:12:33.850
Eight! Shift! 27 blue!

01:12:37.996 --> 01:12:41.523
Oh! Lovin' it, yeah! See what I'm sayin'?

01:12:42.534 --> 01:12:45.025
Splendid.
Yeah, that's tight.

01:13:00.485 --> 01:13:03.079
Here you go, man.
What are these?

01:13:03.155 --> 01:13:07.353
Some new jumps, for when
you lead your troops tomorrow.

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:12.386
Thought it might be easier for you to get
around if your feet didn't weigh 500 pounds.

01:13:13.765 --> 01:13:15.926
I thank you.
It's all good.

01:13:16.802 --> 01:13:19.032
I, too, have something for you. John!

01:13:20.305 --> 01:13:23.900
What's this?
A knight must be properly attired.

01:13:24.309 --> 01:13:26.300
You and I both know I'm no knight.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:31.213
You're as much a knight as any man I know,
should you so choose.

01:13:33.919 --> 01:13:35.978
Sleep well.

01:14:45.857 --> 01:14:49.349
The portcullis is open, unguarded!

01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:59.126
Where is Percival?
Where are the guards?

01:15:15.554 --> 01:15:17.613
Knolte!

01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:34.766
Be brave, lads!

01:15:36.942 --> 01:15:39.240
Hold the line!

01:16:02.968 --> 01:16:04.458
Slaughter them!

01:16:58.156 --> 01:17:00.989
It's the Black Knight! The Black Knight!

01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:03.521
He lives!

01:17:08.733 --> 01:17:11.099
It's the Black Knight!

01:17:33.992 --> 01:17:36.085
The Black Knight!
I can't believe it!

01:17:36.161 --> 01:17:38.026
It's him! He lives!

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.701
It's the Moor!

01:17:50.775 --> 01:17:53.005
Yah!

01:18:20.972 --> 01:18:22.405
Blue 27!

01:18:22.507 --> 01:18:24.475
Set! Hut, hut, hut!

01:18:27.312 --> 01:18:29.872
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!

01:18:36.988 --> 01:18:39.354
Aagh!

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:11.180
I'll take him.
Good idea.

01:19:19.531 --> 01:19:20.589
Is that all you got?

01:19:23.068 --> 01:19:25.536
I pray you, is that all you possess?

01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:26.898
Huh?

01:19:32.177 --> 01:19:33.576
Phillip!

01:19:36.815 --> 01:19:40.808
The kingdom is falling!
Be not afeard. I have everything in hand.

01:19:40.919 --> 01:19:44.616
Are you mad? You must help me flee.
You must get me to safety.

01:19:44.723 --> 01:19:46.816
Shut up!

01:19:46.925 --> 01:19:48.722
Aaah!

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:00.937
Ha-Ha-Ha! Boo-Yeah!

01:20:03.608 --> 01:20:05.007
Watch your step!

01:20:08.213 --> 01:20:10.613
Ha-Ha-Ha! Good, eh?

01:20:14.386 --> 01:20:16.946
And that, my friend, is the Rope-A-Dope.

01:20:23.328 --> 01:20:28.459
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Hey, Knolte, you the man! Yeah!

01:20:38.276 --> 01:20:40.176
Knolte!

01:20:44.015 --> 01:20:46.279
Knolte!

01:20:46.818 --> 01:20:48.979
You're a brave knight.

01:20:49.053 --> 01:20:51.385
It's been an honor fighting beside you.

01:20:52.056 --> 01:20:54.354
Take this.

01:20:55.427 --> 01:20:57.418
You know what to do.

01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:14.142
The Black Knight.

01:21:14.212 --> 01:21:17.375
Drop the sword, or I kill the girl.

01:21:17.449 --> 01:21:20.418
Let her go.
Do it!

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:24.781
Don't do it, Jamal!

01:21:32.230 --> 01:21:33.822
So...

01:21:35.633 --> 01:21:38.124
Now the Moor's a swordsman.

01:22:06.764 --> 01:22:09.790
Now you shall die at my hands, as Knolte did.

01:22:29.787 --> 01:22:30.981
Ohh!

01:22:33.124 --> 01:22:35.058
Let me ask you somethin'.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:37.389
You like baseball?

01:22:40.565 --> 01:22:42.430
Or maybe you like basketball?

01:22:48.373 --> 01:22:50.204
Maybe golf?

01:22:55.647 --> 01:22:58.582
You can thank Tiger for that.

01:23:02.887 --> 01:23:05.151
You OK?
I'm sure I'll be fine.

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:09.118
How's your neck?
You were very brave.

01:23:17.569 --> 01:23:19.628
Let me help you up.

01:23:21.439 --> 01:23:23.339
Jamal!

01:24:03.348 --> 01:24:05.316
Knolte!

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:15.984
Long live the queen!

01:24:17.595 --> 01:24:20.792
Yes! Yes!

01:24:22.967 --> 01:24:26.733
Yes! Knolte!

01:24:31.142 --> 01:24:34.134
We'll have an amazing
life together. You'll love LA.

01:24:34.212 --> 01:24:37.306
But I was thinking...
I'm not goin' back without you.

01:24:37.382 --> 01:24:39.816
You know, I'd go to
the end of the earth for you.

01:24:39.917 --> 01:24:42.351
That's only six miles from here.

01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.445
You've got a lot to learn.

01:24:44.555 --> 01:24:47.456
Teach me.
You want me to teach you?

01:24:58.936 --> 01:25:01.996
'Tis a strange way to...
It's French.

01:25:02.106 --> 01:25:04.165
Oh!

01:25:07.558 --> 01:25:10.527
Sky Walker, are you both
still determined to leave us?

01:25:10.628 --> 01:25:13.256
We hate to lose such a brave warrior.

01:25:14.899 --> 01:25:17.493
Nothin' personal, uh, Miss Queen.

01:25:19.036 --> 01:25:21.504
But, uh, Knolte's right.

01:25:21.572 --> 01:25:23.870
I got my own battles to fight, you know?

01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:32.347
That's my bun. You hooked me up with her.

01:25:34.585 --> 01:25:40.251
She knew I was down with somebody cool,
so she started likin' me.

01:26:00.077 --> 01:26:02.875
In acknowledgment for
your service to the Crown,

01:26:02.947 --> 01:26:08.146
I dub thee Sir Sky Walker, the Black Knight.

01:26:15.626 --> 01:26:17.617
Clear.

01:26:24.168 --> 01:26:25.931
Clear!

01:26:27.171 --> 01:26:30.140
What...?
His vital signs appear normal.

01:26:31.275 --> 01:26:33.766
Jamal! Jamal!

01:26:33.878 --> 01:26:35.743
Yo, you OK, man?

01:26:35.846 --> 01:26:41.079
You scared the hell outta me! You was
under that water for, like, ten minutes!

01:26:41.385 --> 01:26:45.321
Hey. Yo, where's Victoria? Vicky?

01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:48.586
Who?
Stop playin', man!

01:26:48.692 --> 01:26:51.183
Vicky. Victoria, my bun!

01:26:52.196 --> 01:26:55.131
Jamal, what you talkin' about, man?

01:26:56.367 --> 01:26:58.460
What...? Vicky?

01:27:18.956 --> 01:27:22.722
Dude, you know, a workplace
accident like this, we can sue.

01:27:24.161 --> 01:27:27.096
There ain't no honor in that, man.

01:27:29.433 --> 01:27:31.526
Don't think I don't know what you doin'.

01:27:31.635 --> 01:27:35.867
You fake you some accident, get you
a lawyer and walk away with my money.

01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:40.240
Well, it won't work! And I already
went ahead and took your advice.

01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:42.279
What advice?
I quit.

01:27:42.346 --> 01:27:45.747
Oh, Mrs Bostick, you can't quit.

01:27:45.849 --> 01:27:50.047
OK? We can work it out.
We just gotta fight, that's all.

01:27:50.688 --> 01:27:52.713
You on the pipe?

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:54.883
Mrs Bostick, look, um...

01:27:56.694 --> 01:28:02.496
I know things can get a little scary,
but courage isn't the absence of fear.

01:28:03.534 --> 01:28:08.130
It is the presence of fear, yet the will to go on.

01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:14.703
Good, good! I'm lovin' it!

01:28:14.812 --> 01:28:17.645
How's the babies? Everybody's good? Good.

01:28:17.715 --> 01:28:19.808
Oh, this is lovely.

01:28:20.351 --> 01:28:22.683
How you doin', my queen?

01:28:22.753 --> 01:28:25.119
I always knew you had it in you, Jamal.

01:28:25.222 --> 01:28:27.281
Well, I'm just glad you like it.

01:28:27.424 --> 01:28:29.483
I love it.
Good, good.

01:28:33.564 --> 01:28:36.897
No, no, you can't be scared of it. Try it again.

01:28:41.305 --> 01:28:44.240
Oh, lovin' it!
Way to go, Bobby!

01:28:49.513 --> 01:28:53.916
Thanks. I think that's
the first time he actually hit the ball.

01:28:58.355 --> 01:29:00.687
You look familiar.

01:29:01.592 --> 01:29:04.083
So do you. Uh...

01:29:06.196 --> 01:29:10.530
Name's Jamal.
Nicole. My friends call me Nicky.

01:29:11.335 --> 01:29:15.203
I work in admissions up at the college.
Is that where we met?

01:29:15.873 --> 01:29:18.706
Maybe. I registered for some night classes.

01:29:21.478 --> 01:29:23.537
Can I ask you where you got that scar?

01:29:23.647 --> 01:29:26.275
This? Oh, it's from a long, long time ago.

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:31.811
Well, maybe I could take you out to lunch.
You could tell me all about it.

01:29:31.889 --> 01:29:34.858
I'd like that... very much.

01:29:34.925 --> 01:29:37.485
All right. Good.

01:29:39.496 --> 01:29:42.226
Hey, Aunt Nicky?
I gotta go.

01:29:43.133 --> 01:29:46.261
Yeah, well, uh, it's nice meetin' you.

01:29:51.442 --> 01:29:53.706
I... I didn't get your number!

01:29:54.978 --> 01:29:57.071
Excuse me. Yeah.

01:30:19.736 --> 01:30:21.897
Release the lions!
