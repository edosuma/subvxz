01:38.798 --> 01:39.565
hey, gilligan!

01:42.836 --> 01:43.735
Gilligan!

01:45.071 --> 01:46.404
Oh, my gosh.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.973
Man overboard.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.841
I'll save you, skipper!

01:49.876 --> 01:50.843
[Thud]

01:56.149 --> 01:59.317
Gilligan, the <i> minnow's</i>
been beached.

01:59.352 --> 02:01.119
Beached?

02:01.154 --> 02:02.587
When the storm was over
and it was calm,

02:02.622 --> 02:03.855
you said we'd be home
in no time.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.357
It may take longer.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.159
But when the passengers
wake up and want to get off
at the Marina,

02:07.194 --> 02:07.993
what are you
gonna tell them?

02:08.027 --> 02:09.161
I'll think of something.

02:09.196 --> 02:09.995
How are we gonna get home?

02:10.030 --> 02:11.930
Look at those holes.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.632
You know, skipper.
I'm very happy to be here.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.667
I'm so happy,
i could kiss the ground.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.171
Phbbbtttt.

02:19.206 --> 02:20.572
This island tastes terrible.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.376
News reporter:
And there still is no word

02:24.411 --> 02:26.011
on the fate of
the passengers and crew

02:26.046 --> 02:28.947
who were aboard
the small sightseeing boat,
the s.S.<i> Minnow</i>

02:28.982 --> 02:31.483
when she sailed last Tuesday
from Honolulu harbor

02:31.518 --> 02:33.585
for a 3-hour island cruise.

02:33.620 --> 02:36.488
The crew consisted
of a young first mate
named gilligan,

02:36.523 --> 02:39.758
his skipper, Jonas grumby,
is an old salt in these waters.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.427
The passenger list included
one of the world's
wealthiest men,

02:42.462 --> 02:44.429
billionaire
thurston howell III

02:44.464 --> 02:48.066
and his socially prominent
wife, the international
hostess, lovey howell.

02:48.101 --> 02:52.003
Also aboard the missing boat
were miss Mary Ann summers
of winfield, Kansas,

02:52.038 --> 02:54.306
and miss ginger Grant
of Hollywood.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.474
Mary Ann summers,
an attractive young brunette,

02:56.509 --> 02:58.643
is employed at the winfield
general store.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.779
Glamorous ginger Grant,
according to friends,

03:00.814 --> 03:03.114
boarded the boat
after a nightclub
singing engagement

03:03.149 --> 03:05.817
still wearing the evening dress
from her last performance.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.987
The final member of the missing
group was professor Roy Hinkley,

03:09.022 --> 03:12.023
research scientist
and well-known scoutmaster.

03:12.058 --> 03:15.193
Hope for their survival
grows dim.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.828
And now the latest
from wall street.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.496
Today the dow Jones
industrial average--

03:18.531 --> 03:19.798
don't shut that off.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.533
That's the best part.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.101
I mean, really.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.411
Skipper, hey, skipper!

03:33.446 --> 03:35.080
I finished it.
I finished it.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.816
Oh, that's great.
I knew you could
do it, gilligan.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.785
I'm real proud
of my little buddy.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.188
Wait a minute.
You call that finished?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.356
Not the raft,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.157
the sign.

03:46.192 --> 03:47.359
It's a beauty,
isn't it?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.828
Yes, gilligan,
but we can't sail a sign.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.230
Now start lashing
those poles together
with that vine.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.365
Aye, aye, sir.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.468
Skipper.

03:56.503 --> 04:00.238
Skipper, you and gilligan
have got to give up
this crazy scheme.

04:00.273 --> 04:01.973
Professor,
there is nothing crazy

04:02.008 --> 04:03.908
about trying to reach
civilization in order
to bring back help.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.244
On the type of raft
you're building, it's
scientifically impossible.

04:06.279 --> 04:07.245
You haven't
got a chance.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.246
We haven't?

04:08.281 --> 04:09.481
Professor:
Absolutely not.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.615
Skipper: Gilligan.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.117
Without the proper
materials,

04:12.152 --> 04:14.486
you can't possibly survive
the wind, the waves,
the coral reefs,

04:14.521 --> 04:16.120
not to mention
the sharks.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.189
Skipper: Gilligan.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.892
The entire venture
is suicidal.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.163
Skipper, maybe
the professor's
right.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.197
Maybe he's got
something there.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.465
I mean,
it's a nice
little island.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.867
Why don't we
stick around for
a little while?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.335
Start tying.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.337
It's the most wonderful thing
i ever heard of, ginger.

04:32.372 --> 04:34.272
Gilligan and the skipper
risking everything,

04:34.307 --> 04:37.208
braving those stormy seas
and fighting off the attack
of savages.

04:37.243 --> 04:39.177
Reminds me of a trip
i once took to Catalina

04:39.212 --> 04:40.945
on a movie
producer's yacht.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.881
Hi, girls. How you coming
along with the sail?

04:42.916 --> 04:44.416
Oh, it's almost
finished.
Great.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.217
Hey, those look like
my socks in there.

04:46.252 --> 04:47.085
They are.

04:47.120 --> 04:47.986
Oh.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.154
Thanks for
the contribution.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.822
It's just what we needed
to finish the sail.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.123
Well, that does it.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.291
Okay, I'll take it
down to the raft.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.794
Wait. Don't you want
to read the sail?

04:55.829 --> 04:56.828
Read the sail?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.129
It's ginger's idea.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.333
Look what she wrote
on the front.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.200
Sos?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.201
S-o-s.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.003
Oh, yeah. I read it
upside down.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.705
On the other side
we wanted to write
"please hurry,"

05:06.740 --> 05:07.839
but we ran
out of socks.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.842
Before you put
that shellac on,

05:10.877 --> 05:12.410
make sure that mast
is secure.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.646
Oh, the mast
is strong enough
to hold the sail.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.214
Gilligan, it might
have to hold us

05:16.249 --> 05:17.849
if we run into
a storm out there.

05:17.884 --> 05:20.585
Oh, never mind.
I'll check it myself.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.055
Not bad.
Not bad at all.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.891
Gilligan,
you're doing a good job.

05:28.228 --> 05:29.894
What are you
doing with that?

05:29.929 --> 05:31.463
Oh, the professor
made the shellac

05:31.498 --> 05:33.698
out of coconut
sap and sugar.
You want some?

05:33.733 --> 05:35.934
No. Now finish up
that job.

05:35.969 --> 05:40.004
And stop eating
that shellac.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.073
Watch the rope, skipper.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.908
Thanks a lot, gilligan.

05:43.943 --> 05:44.609
Skipper.

05:44.644 --> 05:45.810
What?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.847
This would be great
frozen. A shellac-cicle.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.749
Where is the putty
the professor made?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.350
Oh, the putty
is delicious, skipper.

05:52.385 --> 05:54.753
He made it out
of crushed mangoes
and Berry seeds. Mmm.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.755
Gilligan, can I make you
understand this?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.857
We are not going
out there for a joyride.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.558
It might get pretty
rough out there.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.260
Professor: Skipper.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.062
What is it, professor?

06:04.097 --> 06:06.598
Skipper, look at these.
I found them in one
of the caves.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.100
Uh-oh. Gilligan,
do you know
what these are?

06:09.135 --> 06:11.336
No, but if they taste
as good as the putty,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.738
I'll have them
for dessert.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.273
Looks like a native
arrowhead to me.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.975
Look at this
ceremonial mask.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.577
It looks very much like
the work of the savage
marubi tribe.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.913
Oh, professor,
we have been all
over this island.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.214
There are no natives on it.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.482
What is it
you're driving at?

06:24.517 --> 06:26.885
First, the marubi
still exist as a tribe.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.788
Second, they may
very well be on one
of the nearby islands.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.290
Third, you and your raft
might land on one
of those islands.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.826
Fourth, maybe
we shouldn't go.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.628
Gilligan,
it is our duty.

06:36.663 --> 06:39.097
When this raft is ready,
we are going to shove off.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.832
Aye, aye, sir.

06:40.867 --> 06:44.736
Professor, those
savage marubis,
what do they do?

06:44.771 --> 06:45.937
They're collectors,
gilligan.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.472
Oh, that doesn't
sound too bad.

06:47.507 --> 06:48.773
What do they
collect?

06:48.808 --> 06:50.075
Heads.

06:51.544 --> 06:52.544
Heads?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.749
Oh, skipper, here's
a list of things
i want you to do

06:57.784 --> 06:59.250
the moment that
your raft docks.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.352
I'll get to them
just as soon as
i can, Mr. howell.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.721
Yes, I think
you'll find the list
self-explanatory.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.557
These are the names
of the stocks, you see.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.358
The letter "s" opposite
means sell.

07:07.393 --> 07:11.095
"B" means buy, "m" means
merge, and "h" means...

07:11.130 --> 07:12.730
I wonder what "h" means.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.332
"H" is for
howell, dear.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.634
It's your
note paper.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.536
Yes, yes, of course.
"H," that's me.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.404
You, too.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.139
You folks don't understand.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.708
We'll be kept busy
when we land just
arranging a rescue party.

07:23.743 --> 07:25.577
Oh, captain,
speaking of parties,

07:25.612 --> 07:27.979
would you please
get in touch with
Mrs. Van Hampton?

07:28.014 --> 07:30.482
You see, Mr. howell
and I promised
to attend her party,

07:30.517 --> 07:31.950
and we weren't
able to,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.618
what with
getting shipwrecked
and everything.

07:33.653 --> 07:35.153
Well, I'm sorry, folks,

07:35.188 --> 07:37.188
but I can't worry
about the stock market
and parties.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.990
We've got a lot
of things to do first.

07:39.025 --> 07:41.092
Lovey, there's only one way
to protect our interests.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.228
I will have to go
along on the raft.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.829
Gilligan,
bring my luggage.

07:44.864 --> 07:45.697
Yes, sir.

07:45.732 --> 07:46.831
Never mind, gilligan.

07:46.866 --> 07:47.832
Just keep loading
the supplies on board.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.667
Yes, sir.

07:49.702 --> 07:52.203
Mr. howell, you don't
know what it's like
out there on the ocean.

07:52.238 --> 07:53.771
You may be bitten
by a shark.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.974
A shark
bite a howell?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.976
He wouldn't dare.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.545
Well, besides,
we haven't got room
enough for your luggage.

08:00.580 --> 08:02.213
Oh, well, that's different.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.583
If I can't go first class,
i won't go at all.
Come along, lovey.

08:05.618 --> 08:08.019
Even tourist is crowded.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.856
Well, folks, looks like
gilligan and I are ready
to shove off.

08:11.891 --> 08:14.392
Wait a minute. Wait.
These are for you.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.060
They'll bring
you luck.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.362
Well, how very nice, ladies.

08:17.397 --> 08:18.963
Just wonderful.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.233
Just about all I can
say is <i> aloha nui oe.</i>

08:22.268 --> 08:24.836
That's Hawaiian for
"till we meet again."

08:24.871 --> 08:26.170
I learned
a little Hawaiian

08:26.205 --> 08:28.907
when I was singing
in a club in waikiki.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.242
<i> Wahine wiki</i>
<i> hooki looki nu,</i>

08:31.277 --> 08:33.544
and every word of it
comes from the bottom
of my heart.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.580
Gee, that's
real nice, ginger.
What does it mean?

08:35.615 --> 08:38.582
"This bar is off limits
to all military personnel."

08:38.618 --> 08:41.219
Skipper: Come on, gilligan,
it looks like we're ready
to shove off.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.587
Hoist the anchor.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.589
Let go of the stern line.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.057
Bon voyage.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.859
Good-bye, folks.

08:51.064 --> 08:55.099
Row, gilligan, row.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.368
Good-bye. Aloha.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.270
Bye.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.874
Bye.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.142
Gilligan!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.410
Gilligan!

09:05.445 --> 09:07.579
Did you pull in
the anchor?

09:07.614 --> 09:09.247
That would make us go
a lot faster.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.649
Well, go get it.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.421
Well, bye.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.289
Call my agent.

09:18.324 --> 09:20.024
Be careful.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.192
Good-bye.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.495
Bye.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.166
Bye.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.769
Ginger: Bye, gilligan.

09:31.804 --> 09:32.871
Bye.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.641
Mr. howell: Bye-bye.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.815
Thurston, I do believe
gilligan's gone underwater.

09:43.850 --> 09:45.150
Gilligan!

09:47.620 --> 09:48.687
Gilligan!

09:54.027 --> 09:54.859
Good. He's up again.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.496
Take care.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.972
I'm flipping my lid,
i tell you.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.375
Everywhere I look,
it's water,
water, water!

10:10.410 --> 10:11.009
You stop that,
gilligan.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.577
That's an order.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.845
Well, I'm sick
of orders, and I'm
sick of the sun

10:13.880 --> 10:14.946
and the wind
and the spray
and the salt.

10:14.981 --> 10:15.913
What are you
talking about?

10:15.948 --> 10:17.815
We've only been gone
20 minutes.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.484
Gee, is that all?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.185
Now sit down there
and start paddling!

10:21.220 --> 10:22.987
Dig in!

10:26.059 --> 10:27.759
How do you think
they're doing, professor?

10:27.794 --> 10:29.327
Oh, it's hard to tell,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.663
but at least
they've had calm seas
for the past 3 days.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.498
Oh, I hope
they'll get through.

10:33.533 --> 10:36.534
They've got a good raft,
and the skipper's
a fine sailor,

10:36.569 --> 10:38.770
and, well, gilligan is...

10:38.805 --> 10:41.205
Oh, I hope
they'll get through.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.474
No sign of land,
no sign of ships,

10:43.509 --> 10:44.843
no wind, nothing.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.379
Hey, skipper,
let's have breakfast.

10:48.414 --> 10:49.747
We had breakfast.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.482
Let's have lunch.

10:51.517 --> 10:53.418
We had lunch.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.752
Let's have dinner.

10:54.787 --> 10:57.855
We had dinner, too.

10:57.890 --> 11:01.159
By the way, where are
those tropical leis
the girls made for us?

11:03.830 --> 11:04.962
I had a snack.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.065
Gilligan, will you stop
talking about food?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.266
Okay, skipper.

11:09.702 --> 11:11.202
I wish I had
something to drink,

11:11.237 --> 11:14.038
like a hamburger
or French fries.

11:14.073 --> 11:16.174
Hey, I wished for
something to drink,

11:16.209 --> 11:17.675
and there's a bottle.
Maybe it's soda.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.944
Maybe it's
a bottle of beer.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.779
There's something in it.

11:21.814 --> 11:22.947
Yeah, a note.

11:26.652 --> 11:28.619
What is it?

11:28.654 --> 11:32.957
"Help. We are marooned
on a desert island."

11:32.992 --> 11:34.325
They spelled
maroon wrong.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.794
Let me see that.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.530
Gilligan, this is the note
that you wrote.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.532
Oh, yeah. I don't know
how to spell maroon.

11:41.567 --> 11:42.667
Give me that bottle.

11:48.374 --> 11:49.373
We've got company.

11:49.408 --> 11:52.076
I sure hope they had
3 meals today.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.311
Where's that
shark repellent?

11:53.346 --> 11:55.113
Didn't the professor say
he was gonna make some?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.048
Yeah. It was delicious.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.317
Gilligan, get over there
and start paddling!

12:04.824 --> 12:07.325
Ooh.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.093
Skipper:
Keep paddling.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.562
Oh, skipper, look.

12:11.597 --> 12:13.097
Skipper.

12:13.132 --> 12:15.166
Don't just stand there,
keep paddling!

12:24.377 --> 12:25.577
[Crunch]

12:41.494 --> 12:42.727
Skipper!

13:00.012 --> 13:01.112
[Crunch]

13:50.763 --> 13:52.496
I thought we'd never
get away from those sharks.

13:52.531 --> 13:54.098
Thank goodness
bamboo is filling.

13:54.133 --> 13:55.366
We haven't got
much raft left,

13:55.401 --> 13:56.734
but we'll get
where we're going.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.336
We've got a good
current behind us.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.470
Yup, skipper.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.073
From here on,
it looks like
smooth sailing.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.107
[Thunder]

14:11.117 --> 14:13.517
Skipper, do you think
we should abandon ship?

14:13.552 --> 14:14.518
It's too late.

14:14.553 --> 14:17.055
It's already abandoned us.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.951
You alright,
gilligan?

14:46.986 --> 14:48.987
Oh, I'm fine, skipper.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.557
What's that?

14:53.592 --> 14:56.527
Oh, I saved the raft.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.596
Good work, gilligan.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.833
I wonder where we are.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.335
I don't know.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.972
We must have traveled
hundreds of miles.

15:08.007 --> 15:10.508
First thing we gotta do
is build a fire.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.410
Oh, yeah, right, skipper,

15:12.445 --> 15:15.413
and I got the matches
right here.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.214
Alright, gilligan.
I'm all set here.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.384
Bring the fire,
and don't let it go out.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.319
Gilligan:
Aye, aye, skipper.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.853
Whoo, ooh,
take it, take it.

15:22.888 --> 15:24.055
Take it, take it.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.957
Don't give it to--ooh!

15:25.992 --> 15:28.426
The fire.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.727
What did you do that for?

15:29.762 --> 15:31.362
It was hot.

15:31.397 --> 15:33.164
Of course it was hot.

15:35.034 --> 15:39.003
This is certainly
better than that
open beach out there.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.271
Well, don't
just stand there.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.739
Bring some wood
for the fire.

15:57.423 --> 15:59.457
Professor, ginger,

15:59.492 --> 16:00.858
oh, look.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.760
There's smoke
on the other side
of the island.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.029
Girls, I'm afraid we may
be in for some trouble.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.832
There's a chance
the marubi may have
returned to this island.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.233
Those headhunters?

16:09.268 --> 16:11.002
Oh, golly, professor.
What'll we do?

16:11.037 --> 16:12.937
The first thing
we ought to do
is hide our heads.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.406
I want you girls
to gather up some
of these conch shells

16:15.441 --> 16:17.174
and meet me
at the clearing.
But--

16:17.209 --> 16:19.844
at the clearing.
I'm gonna warn
the howells about this.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.883
Skipper: Gilligan, look.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.151
Hey, that's pretty
good, skipper.

16:27.186 --> 16:29.120
How did you make
all the footprints?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.721
Those aren't mine.

16:30.756 --> 16:33.357
Well, they sure aren't mine.
I don't have that many feet.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.226
There are other people
on this island.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.560
Oh, great.
Let's go find them.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.229
No, wait.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.231
Remember what
the professor said about
the marubi headhunters?

16:40.266 --> 16:41.465
Yeah.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.267
Suppose they live
on this island.

16:43.302 --> 16:44.502
Yeah.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.406
Oh, dash it all, lovey.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.007
I've 3-putted again.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.842
Well, I think you're
doing very well, dear,

16:51.877 --> 16:55.212
considering you're using
a clam shell on a bamboo
stick for a putter.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.481
Not to mention
an avocado pit for a ball.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.050
Here, I'll try it again.

16:59.085 --> 16:59.784
Mr. howell.

16:59.819 --> 17:00.851
Quiet, please!

17:00.886 --> 17:01.886
But, Mr. howell--

17:01.921 --> 17:03.921
shh, professor,
Mr. howell
is putting.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.790
I know, but I've got
important news.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.058
Not while I'm putting.

17:07.093 --> 17:09.627
Mr. howell, I believe
the marubi may be here.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.829
I don't care who's here.
They are not playing through.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.464
Thurston,
i believe
the marubi

17:14.500 --> 17:15.633
are those nasty
headhunters

17:15.667 --> 17:17.001
the professor
told us about.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.036
I think it's advisable
we prepare a defense.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.906
Well, as I always
say, a good defense
is a strong offense.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.941
Wipe the buzzards out
before they can attack us.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.009
Yes, but how?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.844
Simple. First we
blow up their bridge.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.612
Mr. howell,
i don't even know
if they have a bridge.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.215
Those crafty devils.
They've outsmarted us
already.

17:31.250 --> 17:33.217
Alright, stand back.
Quiet, please.

17:33.252 --> 17:36.387
Professor, professor,
we've got the conch shells.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.223
Oh, good, good. Now,
these shells will be
our warning system.

17:39.258 --> 17:42.259
If you run into danger,
you just blow into them
like this.

17:42.294 --> 17:43.461
¶

17:44.763 --> 17:45.996
what's that?

17:46.031 --> 17:48.999
Now let's all try it,
just to make sure.

17:49.034 --> 17:50.968
¶¶
¶
¶

17:51.003 --> 17:52.303
must be the wail
of the marubis.

17:52.338 --> 17:53.404
Oh, no.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.907
Oh, yes. We'd better
camouflage ourselves.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.917
¶

18:07.553 --> 18:09.086
[giggling]

18:09.121 --> 18:11.856
Stop that, gilligan.
This is
no laughing matter.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.626
Now this is the cave
where I found the marubi
arrowhead.

18:15.661 --> 18:17.595
Might be safe in there.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.864
My, it looks dark
in here.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.931
It is. Pitch dark.

18:20.966 --> 18:23.234
It'll make a wonderful
hiding place,

18:23.269 --> 18:24.768
and with those rocks,

18:24.803 --> 18:29.373
I think I can rig
a pretty interesting trap
for our marubi friends.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.142
Hold still,
gilligan.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.110
I sure hope
this island doesn't
have any termites.

18:33.145 --> 18:34.812
At least we'll be
safe like this,

18:34.847 --> 18:38.215
so we can scout around
and see what's what.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.317
Skipper, I think
you made my roots
too long.

18:40.352 --> 18:43.054
Never mind. Just take
short steps like this.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.193
How do I look?

18:49.228 --> 18:51.228
Like a fat bush.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.831
Gilligan, when i
want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.399
You just
asked for it.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.734
Oh, shut up!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.802
Shh.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.538
Remember, now.
If there's any danger,

19:00.573 --> 19:02.840
just stand still,
and you're a tree.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.908
[Bird squawks]

19:06.845 --> 19:08.312
Gilligan,
come back here!

19:08.347 --> 19:09.413
Here's some more.

19:09.448 --> 19:11.715
Good. Start spreading
these around,

19:11.750 --> 19:13.584
but be careful.
It's all set.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.452
Now, the vine
is the trigger.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.422
It goes over here,
around the tree stump,

19:18.457 --> 19:19.690
up here,

19:19.725 --> 19:21.125
over to here,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.260
and is attached
to these 2 small rocks.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.162
And if anyone tries
to get into the cave--

19:25.197 --> 19:27.264
the minute
they touch that vine,
it creates a tension,

19:27.299 --> 19:30.501
out come these 2 rocks,
and the whole thing comes
tumbling down on them.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.069
It's a wonderful
trap, professor.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.370
Be careful, now.

19:33.405 --> 19:34.939
It's all set to go.

19:34.974 --> 19:35.940
Gilligan!

19:35.975 --> 19:37.508
Gilligan:
Over here, skipper.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.110
Watch the rock, skipper.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.813
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

19:42.848 --> 19:44.582
Gilligan:
Are you alright?

19:45.651 --> 19:48.919
I'm fine, just fine.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.888
I gotta rest
a second.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.089
Will you stop
going so fast?

19:52.124 --> 19:53.224
Okay, skipper.

19:53.259 --> 19:57.027
From now on,
we'll stick
closer together.

19:57.062 --> 19:58.929
Did you see
anything?

19:58.964 --> 19:59.964
Well?

19:59.999 --> 20:00.965
Skipper.

20:01.000 --> 20:01.966
What?

20:02.001 --> 20:03.000
I'm being attacked.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.034
Attacked?

20:04.069 --> 20:06.504
Yeah, by a woodpecker.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.540
Shoo.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.175
Shoo.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.044
Hey!

20:14.079 --> 20:15.646
Are you gonna keep
pecking my head?

20:19.652 --> 20:20.251
Wait.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.252
What?

20:21.287 --> 20:23.788
That tree
over there moved.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.158
The tree ran away,

20:28.193 --> 20:30.227
and there goes
a fat bush.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.428
It is the marubi.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.130
They often
disguise themselves.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.466
We'd better
warn the others.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.601
¶
¶

20:39.104 --> 20:40.437
skipper, they're gonna
attack any minute.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.605
I'm getting
out of this tree.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.440
Now is no time
to panic, gilligan.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.476
It's as good
a time as any.

20:45.511 --> 20:46.744
¶

20:49.114 --> 20:50.447
would you watch
where you're going?

20:50.482 --> 20:51.849
What did you stop
for, skipper?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.117
Look, gilligan, a cave.

20:53.152 --> 20:54.918
We can hide in the cave.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.754
Well, what are you
waiting for?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.622
The skipper always
leads his crew.

20:58.657 --> 20:59.957
Gilligan,
get in the cave.

20:59.992 --> 21:01.959
Wait, wait,
i got a great idea.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.661
Why don't we fix a trap
with these rocks?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.162
Fix 'em so they fall
down on the marubi,

21:05.197 --> 21:09.767
and we can use a vine
just like this one, see.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.169
Good idea?

21:12.204 --> 21:14.204
What a ridiculous scheme.

21:14.239 --> 21:16.173
Do you really think
that you can take a vine,

21:16.208 --> 21:17.608
run it along
the ground here,

21:17.643 --> 21:19.243
over this tree stump,

21:19.278 --> 21:20.878
up alongside the cave,

21:20.913 --> 21:22.279
and tie it
into these rocks

21:22.314 --> 21:25.849
so that all these
rocks fall down?

21:25.884 --> 21:27.718
It is a trap.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.820
It must have been set
by the marubi.

21:29.855 --> 21:31.922
Gilligan, now I know
we'll be safe in that cave.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.458
When the marubi come back,
see that their trap
isn't sprung,

21:34.493 --> 21:35.559
they'll go away.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.161
[Leaves rustling]

21:37.196 --> 21:38.296
Watch the vine.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.632
Skipper: What
are you stopping for?

21:41.667 --> 21:42.599
Gilligan:
Skipper--

21:42.634 --> 21:43.467
never mind.
I'll go ahead.

21:43.502 --> 21:44.601
[Thump] Oops.

21:44.636 --> 21:45.636
There's a low
rock there.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.104
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

21:47.139 --> 21:47.871
Cut that out.

21:47.906 --> 21:48.706
Yes, sir.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.140
Quit it--ooh!

21:50.175 --> 21:50.941
Another one.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.645
Here we go.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.080
Be careful
of this vine.

21:56.115 --> 21:58.182
This is the trap
i told you about.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.184
Careful. Right
into the cave.

22:00.219 --> 22:03.153
You'll be perfectly
safe in there.

22:03.188 --> 22:04.655
Good heavens.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.161
[Fighting]

22:21.306 --> 22:23.407
I beg your pardon!

22:29.882 --> 22:31.115
Hey, don't go
in there, mister.

22:31.150 --> 22:31.949
There's marubi in there.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.050
Gilligan!

22:33.085 --> 22:34.618
Professor, what are you
doing on this island?

22:34.653 --> 22:36.019
I've always been
on this island.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.788
Oh, then that must be
us in there.

22:37.823 --> 22:38.922
I better go tell 'em.

22:38.957 --> 22:40.824
Be careful
of that vine.
That's a trap.

22:40.859 --> 22:42.559
I know.

22:42.594 --> 22:43.627
[Fighting]

22:47.566 --> 22:48.932
They threw me out.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.567
Well, I'll tell them.
You stay here.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.770
Be careful of the vine.
It's a trap.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.638
I know.

22:54.673 --> 22:55.606
[Fighting]

23:00.546 --> 23:03.213
Professor:
All clear, gilligan!

23:03.248 --> 23:05.616
Oh, boy. It's great
to be home again.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.562
Let me give you
a hand.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.264
Oh, that gilligan.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.232
It's all his fault.

23:22.267 --> 23:24.835
I warned him
about that vine.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.904
Watch yourself
now, Mary Ann.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.439
Don't scrape
your back.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.008
Careful, careful.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.075
Are you alright?

23:32.110 --> 23:34.111
I think so.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.846
[Coughs]

23:35.881 --> 23:38.182
Watch your ankle.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.550
Are you hurt,
ginger?

23:39.585 --> 23:41.185
No, I'm alright.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.553
[Coughing]

23:42.588 --> 23:47.224
But look at my dress.
It's the only dress I have.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.992
It's ruined.

23:49.027 --> 23:50.994
Oh, that gilligan.

23:51.029 --> 23:52.730
Careful,
Mrs. howell.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.099
Thank you, captain.

23:56.134 --> 23:57.100
Are you well?

23:57.135 --> 23:58.202
Not very.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.104
Careful.

24:01.139 --> 24:02.339
Watch yourself.

24:02.374 --> 24:05.509
Tremendous. I thought
that we had been--

24:05.544 --> 24:07.778
ohh!

24:07.813 --> 24:09.446
Careful,
Mr. howell.

24:09.481 --> 24:13.517
Reminds me
of the back 9.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.752
Careful with him.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.355
Watch your step.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.389
That's it.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.191
Where's gilligan?

24:21.226 --> 24:23.327
I'm gonna count to 3.

24:23.362 --> 24:26.396
If you don't come out,
I'm gonna come in
and get you.

24:26.431 --> 24:28.298
1...

24:28.333 --> 24:29.766
2...

24:29.801 --> 24:30.667
3.

24:30.702 --> 24:31.702
Aah!

24:31.737 --> 24:33.971
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!

24:41.880 --> 24:42.412
[Roar]

24:42.447 --> 24:43.848
Aah!

24:46.685 --> 24:49.653
Skipper gone.
Gilligan one smart marubi.

24:57.963 --> 24:59.963
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

24:59.998 --> 25:02.199
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:02.234 --> 25:04.701
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:04.736 --> 25:06.670
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:06.705 --> 25:08.739
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:08.774 --> 25:10.908
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:10.943 --> 25:13.043
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:13.078 --> 25:15.245
¶ in their tropic
island nest ¶

25:15.280 --> 25:16.346
¶ no phones, no lights ¶

25:16.381 --> 25:17.447
¶ no motorcars ¶

25:17.482 --> 25:19.516
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:19.551 --> 25:21.818
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:21.853 --> 25:23.887
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:23.922 --> 25:26.156
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:26.191 --> 25:28.292
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:28.327 --> 25:30.594
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:30.629 --> 25:32.563
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
