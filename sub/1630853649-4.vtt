13:42.197 --> 13:44.241
Okay.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.631
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.

13:59.714 --> 14:01.967
The situation's far from ideal.

14:02.050 --> 14:05.637
Now, the Pentagon's new budget
reflects a, a paradigm shift,

14:05.720 --> 14:08.974
with cuts or reallocation
in almost every sector.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.685
Now, if it goes through,
our contract would terminate,

14:11.768 --> 14:15.063
without renewal, in 18 months.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.524
And given Elias Ryberg's
decision to postpone his visit,

14:17.607 --> 14:19.609
I think it's safe to assume
that he now views us

14:19.693 --> 14:21.695
as a risky investment.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.073
Still, it is Capstone's advice

14:25.156 --> 14:27.909
that Nubellum's board
remain patient

14:27.993 --> 14:30.412
and pursue the sale.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.831
Now, you know me.
You know my values.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.625

14:35.709 --> 14:37.294

14:44.342 --> 14:45.927
Ryberg was there, Steve.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.345
He saw it.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.015
So you'll excuse us if our faith

14:50.098 --> 14:52.058
in your judgment
is a bit shaken.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.020
If Elias wanted out, he'd
say so. He's treading water.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.230
Now, as for Washington,
it's a dynamic machine.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.065
It's also a predictable one.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.151
You just need to know
which dials to turn.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.695
War was never meant to be
Nubellum's business.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.113
I followed you down this path

15:05.196 --> 15:07.574
because you held me up
when I needed it.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.327

when you wanted to sell because,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.370
well...

15:12.454 --> 15:13.413
the return was high.

15:13.496 --> 15:16.750

my business

15:16.833 --> 15:17.959

17:21.458 --> 17:23.293
How are you, fellas?

17:24.836 --> 17:26.546
I'll grab this first bag here.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.094
- Gracias.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.346
It's good to have you back,
mijo.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.015
So good to be here.
Hello, Paola.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.476
- Nice to see you, James.
- You, too.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.023
- So, how was the trip?
- Glorious.

17:45.106 --> 17:47.650
All clear skies and mai tais.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.651
Don't let her fool you.
She's flying

17:48.735 --> 17:50.153
like she's still in Najaf.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.321
- Oh!

17:51.404 --> 17:52.489
Let's go, party people.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.157
Hey, I got dibs
on the pool house.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.910
- Oh, then let's go.
- Vamos.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.755
Your father came to Baja
when he was at a crossroads.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.133
He had that same look
on his face.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.218
And?

18:15.845 --> 18:19.265
He found
a renewed sense of purpose.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.392
As will you.

18:22.977 --> 18:23.978
Thank you.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.066
The Los Angeles
incident

18:28.149 --> 18:29.651
was captured on traffic cameras.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.820
And the NCIS agent who died?

18:31.903 --> 18:34.447
Building's Realtor I.D.'d Reece.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.533
Said he came in
under an assumed name.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.035
If there was any doubt

18:39.118 --> 18:41.246
about Reece and his family,

18:41.329 --> 18:42.664
there's none now.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.332
We were late on this, Rich.

18:46.751 --> 18:48.044
Senator Pryor, ma'am.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.630
We've got defectors
on committee.

18:50.713 --> 18:51.923
Who?

18:52.006 --> 18:53.550
Holbrooke.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.218
Conviser as well.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.178
Someone got to them?

18:57.262 --> 18:59.138
Whoever it is,
they're trying to keep quiet.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.724
Your new budget

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
turns off
an awful lot of spigots.

19:04.853 --> 19:06.062
- So,

19:06.145 --> 19:07.355
where does this leave us?

19:07.438 --> 19:09.691
We have zero margin as is.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.609
If you lose a single vote,

19:11.693 --> 19:13.111
your cuts are D.O.A.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.737
Markups, at the very least.

19:14.821 --> 19:18.283
Is there a world
where we push a CR

19:18.366 --> 19:20.159
and then fiddle-fuck when
it comes back from the House?

19:20.243 --> 19:22.912
James Reece was a good man.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.706
He gave most
of his adult life to us,

19:24.789 --> 19:27.333
and he came back compromised.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.753
We won't find a resolution
in the margins.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.755
We need a change,

19:32.839 --> 19:34.424
not a reconciliation deal.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.092
We need...

19:43.224 --> 19:45.059
I want the hearing televised.

19:45.143 --> 19:46.519
Ma'am, it's a...

19:46.603 --> 19:48.104
closed-door committee.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.523
Then we will open it up
for the final vote.

19:50.607 --> 19:53.484
Let's get these senators
on record making the case

19:53.568 --> 19:55.069
that special interests
are more important

19:55.153 --> 19:56.487
than special operators.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.952
I would like to see them
make that case.

20:20.428 --> 20:21.846
- Amén.
- Amén.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.015
- Amen.
- Amen.

20:24.098 --> 20:26.684
Marco, Paola, gracias.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.811
You really outdid yourselves
with this one.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.397
And tomorrow we have barbacoa.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.566
When you have a shooter
like Reece on the ranch,

20:33.650 --> 20:36.402
- you put him to work.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.946
You don't need me
to shoot a ram.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.530
My old man used to tell me
he learned more

20:39.614 --> 20:41.074
about judging distances
from Marco

20:41.157 --> 20:42.408
than he did any sniper school.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.702
Tomás was always too generous
with his praise.

20:44.786 --> 20:47.372
Ha! I'm not sure we're talking
about the same Tom Reece.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.251
You know, doesn't matter
how many times I-I come here,

20:52.335 --> 20:54.879
I seem to always forget
just how beautiful it is.

20:54.963 --> 20:56.172
My gosh.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.341
Last time I was here was...

20:58.424 --> 20:59.926
my anniversary, I think.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.183
I remember the girls
caught that big jar of fireflies

21:07.266 --> 21:09.268
down by the trees.

21:11.813 --> 21:12.730
Sí.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.607
The hacienda is, uh,

21:14.691 --> 21:16.192
sacred to us.

21:17.235 --> 21:21.197
A sanctuary away
from the chaos outside.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.076
Pásame el aguachile, ¿sí?

21:25.159 --> 21:26.703
Gracias.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.915
Mr. Reece,

21:30.999 --> 21:33.042
I told my mom I wanted
to go to the funeral.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.168
Antonia.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.129
I didn't know
Lucy was sick,

21:36.212 --> 21:38.756
or I would have sent her
a letter.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.677
She'd have loved that,
sweetheart.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.721
She'd have loved that very much.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.894
James, I... I'm sorry.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.980
Eh.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.315
To the host.

21:56.399 --> 21:58.693
You provide the drink

21:58.776 --> 22:00.486
and the land
that provides the food.

22:00.570 --> 22:02.655
Por la familia.

22:04.407 --> 22:06.826
Por la familia.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.123
Salud, mi amor.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.051
So, here's the question.

22:23.134 --> 22:26.304
What do I have to do to
poach you from Paul's ranch?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.810
When it comes
to taste in bosses,

22:32.894 --> 22:35.188
the quality I value most
is absenteeism.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.859
Oh, wow,
they're so beautiful.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.069
Aren't they?

22:41.152 --> 22:43.613
Come on,
show it to Daddy.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.031
...no business
craving as much as I do.

22:45.114 --> 22:48.117
But besides that,
you got 'em beat, hands down.

22:48.201 --> 22:50.870
- So it's done.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.545
Hey.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.421
Hey, oh, I can help clean up.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.173
I was just, uh, I was trying
to catch the sunset.

23:48.052 --> 23:49.637
How much trouble are you in?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.973
I'm not. Brian, come on.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.307
I saw your research upstairs.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.853
It's a story, that's all.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.981
I just need a couple days.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.760
Thought you might want a drink.

24:31.929 --> 24:33.973
You always were a mind reader.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.396
- Salud.
- Salud.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.486
Ben called.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.074
He traced a payment
from your man's phone

24:52.158 --> 24:53.326
to a bank in Ensenada.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.204
My men are looking into it.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.464
I keep asking myself...

25:08.925 --> 25:11.469
...what is his purpose?

25:11.552 --> 25:13.054
What is his plan?

25:13.137 --> 25:16.849
What vision could he
possibly have for you...

25:17.934 --> 25:19.143
...to do this?

25:21.646 --> 25:24.023
I think of the story of Job...

25:25.233 --> 25:28.152
...and I wonder if perhaps

25:28.236 --> 25:32.907
this is some kind
of bet with the devil...

25:32.990 --> 25:35.826
to see if they can break you.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.379
They never broke Job.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.843
But they're getting
pretty damn close with me.

26:39.974 --> 26:43.394
Lucy, come back here!

26:47.857 --> 26:49.984
I figured you'd have
business in mescal.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.653
I mean,
once you got that account,

26:52.737 --> 26:54.405
it was just a matter of time.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.408
- James.
- Hola, sunshine.

26:57.491 --> 27:01.162
Wow. You just go right ahead
and kick the shit out

27:01.245 --> 27:03.289
- of yourself last night?

27:03.372 --> 27:06.500
- Man, when'd you get in?
- Thirty minutes ago.

27:06.584 --> 27:07.918
Got two days' clearance.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.420
What, you think
I'm gonna let you just

27:09.503 --> 27:11.881
finish this guy off on your own?

27:11.964 --> 27:13.674
Finish?

27:13.758 --> 27:15.384
Marco was just filling us in.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.886
Es verdad.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.304
The leader
of my security team believes

27:18.387 --> 27:21.098
he's found
Lauren and Lucy's killer.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.982
- Morning.
- Morning.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.235
Uh, you mind
if I borrow your car?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.862
I want to make a coffee run.

27:34.945 --> 27:37.865
Oh, I'll do it. Brian and Teddy
are down by the beach.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.117
- You should go join them.
- No. It's your vacation.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.327
Just tell me what you want.
My treat.

27:41.410 --> 27:43.954
We'll take two flat whites.

27:44.038 --> 27:46.665
- Keys are by the front door.
- Thanks.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.018
Katie Buranek?

28:17.613 --> 28:20.116
I read up on you, Ms. Buranek.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.869
Portland, Kenosha,
Hubei province.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.164
You have a history
of getting in over your head.

28:27.248 --> 28:30.042
Well, it's the best way
to see beneath the surface.

28:31.419 --> 28:32.795
That's cute.

28:34.463 --> 28:35.548
Where's James Reece?

28:36.715 --> 28:37.675
I don't know.

28:37.758 --> 28:40.094
- I don't believe you.
- Okay.

28:40.177 --> 28:43.305
Based on your work up there,
you seem like a smart person.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.559
So why make yourself
an accessory to murder?

28:46.642 --> 28:48.727
What I witnessed wasn't murder.
It was self-defense.

28:48.811 --> 28:49.979
I'm not talking
about Los Angeles.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.566
James Reece didn't
kill his family.

28:53.649 --> 28:55.484
Why don't you talk
to Saul Agnon?

28:55.568 --> 28:56.986
Ask him how
Capstone Industries gave

28:57.069 --> 28:59.989
an entire platoon
of Navy SEALs brain tumors.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.991
That's the real story.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.618
I'd love to talk to Saul Agnon,
I would.

29:04.702 --> 29:05.619
But he's dead.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.997
I made some calls.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.417
Agnon suffered
an overdose in Santa Barbara

29:11.500 --> 29:13.294
a day after you
and Reece were in L.A.

29:13.377 --> 29:15.463
Found him with a needle
in his arm.

29:15.546 --> 29:20.384
No history of opioid use.
That's curious, don't you think?

29:20.468 --> 29:21.886
And NCIS Agent Josh Holder?

29:23.304 --> 29:25.473
He ate a bullet
from someone else's gun

29:25.556 --> 29:26.724
the night before
Reece went on the run.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.392
So, you know, it's...

29:28.476 --> 29:30.478
it's also unusual.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.824
Look, you got a scoop.
I get it.

29:46.202 --> 29:48.996
But I don't think you want
to see anyone else dead.

29:50.581 --> 29:54.627
And I'm sure you don't want
to get hit with a felony charge.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.513
I... I don't know where he is,
I don't.

30:08.933 --> 30:11.352
But...

30:11.435 --> 30:14.355
if I find out,
I will let you know.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.607
There you go, Ms. Buranek.

30:25.658 --> 30:28.118
Enjoy your family time.

31:17.001 --> 31:18.002
Can I help you?

31:26.468 --> 31:29.388
What's all this?

31:29.471 --> 31:31.098
Let's talk.

31:31.181 --> 31:34.310
You familiar with
the Battle of Messines?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.895
- No.
- World War I.

31:36.979 --> 31:40.774
Brits and the Germans
reach a stalemate at Flanders.

31:40.858 --> 31:43.360
There's this General Plumer
on the English side.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.112
Super patient guy.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.489
He spends five months
building 8,000 meters

31:47.573 --> 31:49.491
of tunnels
under the enemy position.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.994
Packs 'em with 600 pounds
of explosives,

31:52.077 --> 31:54.496
and one day...

31:56.665 --> 32:00.878
Blast kills 10,000 Germans.
Stalemate over.

32:02.338 --> 32:04.298
Fucking Boche
didn't even know what hit him.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.300
Well, that's fascinating.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.052
What the hell
are we doing, Steve?

32:08.135 --> 32:11.889
I've worked really hard
to get under enemy lines.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.975
- You have.
- Look, we both know,

32:15.059 --> 32:17.436
within a year, Hartley's
gonna be out to pasture.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.729
No one's gonna miss her.

32:18.812 --> 32:20.230
So right now you need to decide

32:20.314 --> 32:21.899
if you want to be
a little red link

32:21.982 --> 32:25.903
on her Wikipedia page
or the heir apparent.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.864
Our deal was for information.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.282
That's right.

32:30.366 --> 32:31.867
And I'm changing the deal

32:31.950 --> 32:33.744
to protect my investment.
You understand?

32:33.827 --> 32:35.996
This new budget
threatens my business.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.582
- The votes are locked.
- Not Pryor.

32:41.543 --> 32:45.798
Pryor. Pryor is the one calling
for this type of dwell reform.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.092
I'm not asking you to turn him.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.720
Just get him to me.

32:59.269 --> 33:01.689
This is gonna be
really good for you, Richard.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.817
You just don't know it yet.

33:23.293 --> 33:26.004
Navajas and his gang
contract to multiple cartels.

33:26.088 --> 33:28.215
He's violent, ambitious.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.676
He'll kill anyone
for the right price.

33:30.759 --> 33:31.927
We're sure that he's the one?

33:32.010 --> 33:34.805
According to our sources,
three weeks ago,

33:34.888 --> 33:36.765
Navajas and a lieutenant
left their compound.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.559
Only Navajas returned.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.353
Carrying a wound
to his left forearm.

33:48.402 --> 33:49.695
It's him.

33:51.238 --> 33:54.700
Navajas and his men
train young sicarios

33:54.783 --> 33:56.243
in an old factory
outside of Ensenada.

33:56.326 --> 34:00.914
- How many?
- Sometimes 12, sometimes more.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.751
That's not counting the boys he
trains. There's a storm coming.

34:03.834 --> 34:06.503
It should provide us
the cover we need.

34:06.587 --> 34:10.424
The hills here offer
a view from 200 meters.

34:10.507 --> 34:12.050
You stalk.
You wait.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.927
It's maybe one of the easier
shots you'll ever take.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.262
Ah...

34:15.345 --> 34:16.513
James?

34:16.597 --> 34:18.390
No. A shot's no good.

34:18.474 --> 34:20.058
It's a clear line of sight.

34:20.142 --> 34:22.394
Aarón is former
Fuerzas Especiales.

34:23.437 --> 34:24.563
His tactics are sound.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.774
I-I don't question
your tactics, Aarón,

34:26.857 --> 34:27.816
it's not a tactical issue.

34:27.900 --> 34:28.817
We need to go in,

34:28.901 --> 34:30.611
make contact, hit 'em head-on.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.488
That's the only way this works.

34:36.492 --> 34:38.619
Hey, can I talk to you a second?

34:46.794 --> 34:48.170
Listen, I fucking get it.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.297
I want to bleed
this motherfucker out

34:50.380 --> 34:51.799
just as much as you do.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.635
But this guy...

34:54.718 --> 34:57.346
he does not lead us
to the big picture, brother.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.556
Steve Horn does.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.601
Take the fucking shot.
Head north.

35:03.894 --> 35:06.980
When he came for them,
Lauren put her body

35:07.064 --> 35:10.192
over Lucy to shield her.
I ever tell you that?

35:10.275 --> 35:14.696
So, Lucy's last moments were
her mom screaming and crying,

35:14.780 --> 35:17.866
covering her
as Navajas looked down on them.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.122
I want him to know
who's come for him.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.332
It doesn't work any other way.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.760
Okay.

35:39.471 --> 35:41.890
Okay. Let's go.

35:51.608 --> 35:53.735
We can't ask your men
to put their lives at risk.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.864
We got this.
Me and Ben.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.824
No.

35:58.907 --> 36:01.994
This is a chance to wipe
this entire evil off the map.

36:03.412 --> 36:04.913
It's the right thing
to do.

36:04.997 --> 36:07.374
We'll be doing
the world a favor.

36:11.545 --> 36:12.796
All right.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.717
We use high ground
for overwatch.

North and south.

Reece.

36:21.597 --> 36:22.890
No, no, it's okay.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.563
The others approach on foot.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.856
Reece?

36:30.939 --> 36:33.275
It's nothing. I'm good.

36:38.530 --> 36:40.407
Based on your timeline,

36:40.490 --> 36:43.410
it appears
the tumor is fast-growing.

36:43.493 --> 36:47.664
If it's a glioblastoma,
that's bad news. Also rare.

36:47.748 --> 36:49.166
I won't be certain without...

36:49.249 --> 36:52.044
Without a biopsy. I know.

36:52.127 --> 36:55.339
There are excellent surgeons
in Mexico City.

36:55.422 --> 36:59.009
With the right plan,
six to nine months,

36:59.092 --> 37:01.094
you can have your life back.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.556
What are my other options?

37:07.768 --> 37:10.395
Suffering.
Death, I suppose.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.160
What about something
to control the symptoms?

37:26.370 --> 37:29.247
Corticosteroids will reduce
the swelling.

37:29.331 --> 37:32.292
Propranolol, topiramate,

37:32.376 --> 37:35.796
they can help with the tremors
and the migraines.

37:35.879 --> 37:38.256
But drugs won't save you.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.349

told us, Reece.

known.
- Bullshit.
