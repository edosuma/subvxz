WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.703
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.878 --> 00:05.790
It's been three sessions
and I haven't remembered anything.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.215
- Progression is weird.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.293
You never know
what is gonna trigger a memory.

00:09.384 --> 00:12.217
- If I do this, you vouch for me.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.714
Introduce me to the others.

00:13.889 --> 00:17.723
It's done. Fromsley's set to be
transferred within the hour.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.512
(groans)

00:19.645 --> 00:20.509
- Go!

00:24.274 --> 00:25.605
(gunshot)

00:25.692 --> 00:27.728
- How did it go with,
uh, your contact, Jordan?

00:27.903 --> 00:30.519
Did the prisoner transfer go through?

00:32.407 --> 00:33.988
- No drama.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.909
- It's the bolt-gun killer.
- What about him?

00:38.080 --> 00:41.038
- What if he's not using
body parts for trophies?

00:41.208 --> 00:43.745
What if he's building a woman?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.755
(thunder cracks)

00:50.926 --> 00:54.839
(both giggle and shout)

00:55.013 --> 00:56.298
- Come here.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.307
- Chad, this is trespassing.
- lt's Halloween.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.642
The front door is wide open.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.939
We're legally allowed in.

01:08.110 --> 01:12.149
Besides, this place has been abandoned
since, like, Walkmans.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.114
It's just us in here.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.992
You know what that means?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.574
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

01:22.833 --> 01:26.451
(sighs)
- There is something wrong with him.

01:27.337 --> 01:29.419
(thunder claps)

01:31.633 --> 01:32.918
Chad?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.170
Chad?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.802
Chad?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.781
(light switches click)
Chad, you scared me.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.071
Oh wow, this is nice, Chad.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.285
Very romantic.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.920
- Huh.
- Chad?

02:13.008 --> 02:15.750
- One of these switches
must have turned on the gas.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.130
Hey, maybe there's electricity too.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.552
(screams)
- Oh, my God!

02:26.647 --> 02:28.729
Oh, my God!
- Nice.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.931
How many kamikaze shots
did you have?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.942
- I'm leaving now.
(music plays)

02:34.738 --> 02:37.946
Reunited and it feels so good

02:38.033 --> 02:40.740
- Sweet.
(wails)

02:40.827 --> 02:42.943
Reunited

02:43.121 --> 02:46.079
(girl screams)
(thunder claps)

02:46.249 --> 02:48.456
(overlapping chatter)

02:59.930 --> 03:02.672
- Don't worry, I spiked it.
- Good.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.054
Do you think we could
ever drink enough

03:07.229 --> 03:09.265
to believe anything
those two say?

03:09.439 --> 03:10.770
- We can try.

03:12.943 --> 03:14.729
- They ran out of ghost mugs... oh!

03:14.903 --> 03:16.313
No, they didn't.

03:16.405 --> 03:18.396
Thank you.
- There you go.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.235
I'll just get myself another one.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.828
Nice outfit.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.124
- It's amazing to me how some men
struggle with chivalry.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.494
No costume?
- Me?

03:34.673 --> 03:38.131
Dress up as something else? No.
| feel like I do that every day of my life.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.677
I could have actually been
a cheerleader--

03:39.845 --> 03:42.461
- I'm a vampire slayer.
- Okay, that's... that's cool.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.972
Sure, listen, I'm running out of time,
all right,

03:46.143 --> 03:48.134
and in order to figure out
what's happening to me,

03:48.311 --> 03:50.768
I need to find out
what happened to him.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.019
I finished it.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.643
- The Colorado kid?
- Yeah.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.399
- Your dream version, anyway.
I can't believe that you finished this.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.653
- I ran his face through every
missing person database.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.276
Nothing.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.776
Okay, I need to remember more.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.487
- I don't know, Audrey.

04:04.578 --> 04:08.116
I've been rethinking this whole
regression therapy thingâ€”â€”

04:08.290 --> 04:10.952
- But I want to remember.
- Clearly, you don't.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.294
Your subconscious came to you
in your dream as Agent Howard

04:13.378 --> 04:14.959
and told you to stop remembering.

04:15.130 --> 04:19.123
(screams)
- Oh, thank God!

04:19.301 --> 04:22.134
- She saw my car parked
outside the Haven Herald.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.798
- Let me get this straight.

04:23.889 --> 04:26.301
Her boyfriend slammed the door
with his mind.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.224
Some kind of telekinetic
anger Trouble?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.771
- Orjust irrational young love.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.724
- That's even more dangerous.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.267
Want me to meet you at the house?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.433
- No, I got it. We're looking for a reason
to get out of here.

04:37.569 --> 04:38.729
- We?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.895
- | asked Duke to come along.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.154
We're going to take the girl
to help us ID the kid

04:43.241 --> 04:45.232
and Claire will keep an eye on her.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.621
- Check in. I'll send Tommy for backup.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.083
Jordan, you shouldn't be here.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.668
- I'm just a Haven citizen
saying hello to law enforcement.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.721
Hello.
- Just hello?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.348
- Wrapped in a little business.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.980
My friends were impressed

05:18.068 --> 05:20.275
that you helped us
with our little prison break.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.065
They'll call you
when they need you again.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.736
- I'm in?
- Almost.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.281
You just have to pass
one more test.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.446
Buy me a drink?

05:50.934 --> 05:53.596
- Leaving the girl outside
with Claire was a good idea.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.806
I didn't realize we were coming
to the Holloway House.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.187
- Why? What's the deal?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.518
- Roland Holloway
was a blue blood type.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.395
He just took off,

06:01.486 --> 06:03.522
leaving behind
a wife and two daughters.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.902
And suddenly,
they disappeared too.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.620
- Did he kill them?
- Nobody knows.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.288
There are stories.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.707
Bad ones.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.077
- Maybe I should check in with Nathan.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.371
- Yeah.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.961
(scoffs)
- No service.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.383
Of course not. Lucky him.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.173
(Jordan laughs)

06:41.109 --> 06:43.270
- She still hasn't checked in, huh?

06:43.445 --> 06:45.060
- No.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.774
She's my partner.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.781
- That's it?

06:53.955 --> 06:55.616
- Yeah.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.376
- So we can kiss again, right?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.588
(phone rings)

07:13.433 --> 07:15.094
- Chad, this is Haven PD.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.556
- Hello? Parker.
- Make it easy on yourself.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.646
- P...

07:24.736 --> 07:25.771
Weird.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.607
Ah... I should go.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.146
- Why? Does she need your help?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.484
- I don't know.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.362
But I should check.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.739
- Okay. Go.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.327
I hope you find
what you're looking for, Nathan.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.751
- Jordan.
- I can walk to my car.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.803
- Hey, Chad.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.756
Where are you?

07:52.931 --> 07:55.013
Maybe I can help.

08:06.569 --> 08:09.060
What's with all these mirrors?

08:09.239 --> 08:11.230
- Rich people.
They're narcissists.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.569
Parker!

08:27.674 --> 08:28.789
Audrey.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.040
Hey. Hey.

08:33.555 --> 08:35.716
(groans)
You okay?

08:35.807 --> 08:37.513
- Yeah.

08:38.810 --> 08:41.017
ljust got a little...

08:42.522 --> 08:45.389
You can let me stand now, Duke.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.519
- Yeah.

08:50.655 --> 08:51.815
Yeah...

08:54.284 --> 08:55.899
Audrey, you're tracking blood
behind you.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.305
(theme music)

09:49.506 --> 09:51.588
- Hey, Tommy.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.423
(Audrey): Oh, my God.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.217
Maybe we just found Chad.

10:04.020 --> 10:07.103
(wood cracks)

10:10.527 --> 10:12.233
How did he get in here?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.781
What are you guys doing here?

10:15.865 --> 10:17.696
- You called us
on the old intercom thing, right?

10:17.784 --> 10:18.990
- I didn't call you.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.661
- Chad!

10:24.541 --> 10:26.327
(house rumbles)

10:30.797 --> 10:32.128
(screams)

10:32.215 --> 10:33.625
- Hey!
- Tina!

10:33.800 --> 10:35.085
- Damn it!

10:40.140 --> 10:42.722
- Where'd she go? Did she get out?
- What the hell?

10:44.394 --> 10:47.056
She didn't go out the front door.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.433
Because the front door...

10:49.858 --> 10:50.973
is gone.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.984
- We're sure that it was there?
(shutters snap shut)

11:02.704 --> 11:04.285
- Yeah. Pretty sure.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.038
- It's got to be a Trouble.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.707
- I hope everybody packed a lunch,
'cause we're trapped.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.542
Seriously?

11:19.637 --> 11:22.504
A ghost just removed the front door.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.466
And you really think that shooting
at the windows is gonna help?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.096
- Damn it!

11:32.192 --> 11:34.433
It's perfect. Ghosts.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.317
Anything else you people
want to let me in on

11:36.487 --> 11:41.026
that goes on around here? Huh?
Mermen? Aliens? Dracula?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.732
- We're not sure about Dracula.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.284
- Somebody's Trouble is doing this
and I'm betting you that it's Tina.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.695
She probably doesn't even know
she's doing it.

11:46.873 --> 11:50.286
- Or she lied to us and
she knows exactly what she's doing.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.919
- Either way, we need to find her.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.872
We're stuck in here
and she could be our only way out.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.083
So Claire, you and l,
we're gonna take downstairs.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.210
Tommy, Duke, look upstairs.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.759
- Or... you and I should.
- Every team needs a cop with a gun.

12:01.846 --> 12:04.713
After what happened to Chad,
nobody goes it alone. Come on.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.803
- If I knew we were gonna be teamed up,
I would have wore a costume too.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.513
What is that? Jack Sparrow?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.068
(bemused laugh)
(mocking laugh)

12:16.236 --> 12:17.351
- Let's go.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.656
- Hey, I got a question for you.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.200
As my doctor, not as my...

12:34.379 --> 12:36.870
cheerleader vampire slayer.

12:37.048 --> 12:39.915
- Hold on. Changing hats.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.419
Okay.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.085
- I think I had another memory flash.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.011
Why would they start up again?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.596
- Buried memories.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.174
They're stored
in the prefrontal cortex

12:49.269 --> 12:50.884
and with the right stimuli,
they can recur.

12:51.062 --> 12:55.021
And some doors,
once they're open, can't be closed.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.227
(wood creaks)

12:58.486 --> 12:59.726
There!

13:12.208 --> 13:13.448
- I got your call.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.958
- I didn't call you.
I didn't have a signal.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.371
Nathan, how did you get in here?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.172
- Came in through the front door, why?
- Show me where it is.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.474
- It was...
This wasn't here before.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.892
- Maybe you got turned around?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.643
- No.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.392
This is the way I came in.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.516
What is going on here?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.400
- Dave?

13:45.575 --> 13:48.317
Audrey and the others
haven't come back yet.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.452
- They must not care for the crusts
on your camembert puffs.

13:51.622 --> 13:52.486
(scoffs)

13:52.665 --> 13:55.657
Listen, they don't trust us anymore,
Vince.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.915
And they have good reason.
Accept it.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.662
- Pardon me, Officer Stan.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.878
Do you know where Detective Parker went
with the girl?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.470
- Some house,
end of Marsten Road?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.512
- They went to Marsten Road!

14:09.682 --> 14:11.718
- Marsten Road?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.894
- I swear we've been here already.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.022
We're hallucinating.
That's what's happening.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.687
- Yeah, I've hallucinated before.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.031
It's much better than this.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.575
(woman screams)

14:44.467 --> 14:47.083
- You.

14:47.178 --> 14:50.215
Turn around slowly.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.880
Easy.

14:52.058 --> 14:52.922
Easy.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.940
Aah! Hey!

15:04.404 --> 15:06.019
- Who are you
and what are you doing here?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.070
- I'm looking at that.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.877
- I've been tasered.
That was ten times worse.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.339
What the hell are you?

15:31.514 --> 15:34.130
- This is Jordan McKee.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.056
She's Troubled.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.222
Her touch causes intense pain.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.935
- Hi, doc.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.270
No suit?

15:47.238 --> 15:49.604
l was a patient. I'm better now.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.489
- Aren't we looking for a serial killer
with that exact same tattoo?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.276
- Not to mention she is standing
underneath a dead girl,

15:55.455 --> 15:57.912
or is that too much of a giveaway?

15:57.999 --> 15:59.785
- We can't exactly arrest her now, Duke.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.116
- I agree.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.500
We should just shoot her.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.412
- Crocker, ask Dr. Callahan

16:05.590 --> 16:09.253
if my Trouble includes
throwing girls into chandeliers.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.461
I didn't do it.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.342
- Then why are you here?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.341
- l...
- She's with me.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.395
She didn't do it.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.282
- None of us did it, then who did?

16:39.457 --> 16:41.413
(phone rings)

16:42.376 --> 16:43.752
- Telephone?

16:43.836 --> 16:44.996
- Let's find it.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.841
- It's going to let us in.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.051
After you.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.848
Dwight?
- Guys.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.305
Got your message.
- Thank God.

17:02.396 --> 17:05.809
- Audrey and the others are inside,
and this house is a death trap.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.765
- So let's go get them.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.650
(door banging)

17:10.988 --> 17:12.364
- Oh, no!

17:12.448 --> 17:15.690
- I'm guessing it's not going to be
that easy.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.404
- How did you get in here?

17:17.578 --> 17:18.693
- The front door.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.996
I followed you here to apologize.
Now I wonder why.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.328
What did your cop mean
about a serial killer with the tattoo?

17:25.503 --> 17:28.711
- Haven PD's been tracking
someone who murders women.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.836
Keeps parts,

17:30.007 --> 17:32.259
maybe to build one for himself.

17:33.261 --> 17:35.673
And we have evidence
that he's got the tattoo.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.628
- So you think I'm a serial killer?

17:37.807 --> 17:43.097
But you just happened to come see me
right at the start of your investigation...

17:43.187 --> 17:45.269
of me, of us.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.347
(phone ringing)

17:47.525 --> 17:49.891
(Nathan): You can trust me.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.066
- Who turned that thing on?

17:51.153 --> 17:52.734
- Shhh!

17:52.822 --> 17:54.062
- Youâ€™re friends with Duke Crocker.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.575
Crockers hunt our kind.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.775
We should kill him before he kills us!

17:58.869 --> 18:02.908
- Well... there's my daily quota
for death threats.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.538
- I am one of you now.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.953
Do you know how much trouble
I would get in if anyone found out

18:07.128 --> 18:09.210
I helped the Guard
with that prisoner escape?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.379
Iâ€™d go to jail.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.209
- I know the chief has that tattoo,

18:16.387 --> 18:19.299
but he told me that
he wasn't really one of them.

18:19.473 --> 18:20.883
- You heard him yourself.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.593
Working together.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.353
- Jordan...

18:30.234 --> 18:32.099
It started as a case, but--

18:34.280 --> 18:36.066
- I'll find my own way out.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.816
- Jordan.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.628
- So what's Nathan doing with Jordan?

18:52.715 --> 18:54.580
- It's just work.
- Okay.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.587
Is he telling you that,
or are you telling yourself that?

18:57.678 --> 18:59.179
- Stop.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.005
- I can't stop,
because I'm your therapist, so--

19:02.099 --> 19:04.215
- No. I mean stop.

19:12.777 --> 19:16.315
- How did you...
- Deâ€™ja vu.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.325
The missing Holloway women.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.116
Mother and daughters.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.159
They didn't leave.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.169
They were here all along.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.426
- This one's self-inflicted.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.180
- She killed them and then... herself?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.731
"I want you to watch.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.149
This is your fault."

20:00.282 --> 20:02.739
- It's that same phrase.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.622
- We're too late.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.662
They were trapped in here.
- So are we, Lucy.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.090
- Thank God.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.923
Audrey, are you all right?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.463
- No.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.141
I know whose fault all this is.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.053
-VVhose?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.186
- Mine.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.068
(panting)

20:43.242 --> 20:45.233
Lucy was in that room.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.283
She was just too late to help them.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.322
- You accessed another repressed memory
from a past life.

20:50.499 --> 20:55.118
- Okay, so if Lucy
was trapped in there back then

20:55.212 --> 20:56.668
and she escaped, that m...

20:56.839 --> 20:58.579
that means if I can remember,

20:58.758 --> 21:00.623
I can help us find a way out.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.583
- No. Remembering could kill you.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.009
Look, you're bleeding!

21:04.180 --> 21:06.296
- Oh!

21:06.390 --> 21:07.766
- A subdural hematoma.

21:07.850 --> 21:11.183
It's like a wall in your head just bursts.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.435
These flashbacks are hurting you.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.098
- Finally!

21:17.193 --> 21:18.308
Have you seen Jordan?

21:18.402 --> 21:19.903
- She's loose in this house?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.649
- Jordan is not a threat.
- You sure about that, chief?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.071
Check your records.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.323
She took revenge on a man
when she was in my care.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.493
She tortured him
with her touch for three days.

21:29.580 --> 21:30.740
She nearly killed him.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.287
He's still in a coma.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.245
It's the reason that
she's not my patient anymore.

21:35.336 --> 21:36.371
- Maybe you don't know her.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.293
- And you do?
- Enough!

21:38.464 --> 21:42.127
We need to get everybody back together
so we can find a way out of here, all right?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.542
Before this place starts
picking us off one by one.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.752
- I'm going to find Jordan.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.059
- We heard this thing go on before.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.021
Maybe we can use it to call outside
or something.

22:01.111 --> 22:04.899
- Yeah.
We could order pizza.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.571
- Oh, there you guys are.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.492
Come on, we need to regroup with Nathan.
- Audrey, wait.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.409
We heard Nathan talking to Jordan
on that box thing.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.745
He's actually in
with the tattoo people or...

22:16.919 --> 22:18.455
at least he's in with her.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.245
- Guys, he's...
he's investigating them.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.378
He's just pretending...

22:22.550 --> 22:25.041
- He told her
it was an investigation, okay?

22:25.135 --> 22:26.591
He's not pretending anymore.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.546
- Listen, I like the chief.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.096
I do, but I heard it too.

22:31.183 --> 22:33.390
- They have similar Troubles.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.472
They could have a profound bond.

22:35.563 --> 22:37.269
I mean, only he can touch her.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.971
- No.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.978
No, lis... He can explain.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.396
- Audrey.

22:44.488 --> 22:46.570
- He went this way, right?

22:47.366 --> 22:48.526
(gasping)
- Audrey!

22:50.661 --> 22:54.028
(house rumbles)

22:54.123 --> 22:56.159
- Oh, my God.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.198
We're being separated.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.720
(Duke): This is a different hallway.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.798
(phone rings)

24:09.114 --> 24:10.149
(gaSDS)

24:21.377 --> 24:24.335
Sure. Why not?

24:50.531 --> 24:52.647
(thunder claps)

24:56.870 --> 24:59.202
(phone rings)

25:20.269 --> 25:22.134
(Nathan): lam one ofyou now.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.769
Do you have any idea
how much trouble I would get in

25:24.940 --> 25:26.726
if people found out
that I helped the Guard

25:26.817 --> 25:28.353
with that prisoner escape?

25:28.444 --> 25:30.526
- Enough!

25:31.989 --> 25:33.320
Show yourself...

25:34.408 --> 25:35.944
whoever you are.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.281
Maybe I can help you.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.906
- Oh, now you can help...

25:45.085 --> 25:46.621
Lucy?

25:47.671 --> 25:50.128
- Who are you?

25:52.468 --> 25:54.925
- I am this house.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.378
- You're Roland Holloway.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.556
You never left.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.762
You're trapped in this place.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.681
- Because of you.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.984
- Oh, my God.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.237
- Don't touch her!

26:17.576 --> 26:19.112
- What happened?

26:20.496 --> 26:22.452
(Claire): We just found her.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.534
- Who did this?

26:25.709 --> 26:27.119
Where's Duke?
- Nathan, stop.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.668
Don't jump to conclusions--
- Get out of my way.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.927
- l restored this house
for my family.

26:43.102 --> 26:47.345
Every wire, every pipe.
Poured everything I had into it.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.145
- You became obsessed.

26:49.316 --> 26:52.274
- Perhaps I was a little too... invested.

26:52.402 --> 26:56.111
Because one day I woke up
and even I was poured in.

26:56.240 --> 27:00.950
My body was gone for good,
and l was this house.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.576
- That's your Trouble?

27:02.663 --> 27:05.075
- The things you own, own you, right?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.704
But Holloways adapt.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.126
- How?

27:11.255 --> 27:14.964
- It took a while,
but I got used to my new body.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.713
I can control every wall,
floor and door in here.

27:21.515 --> 27:23.847
My wife installed mirrors
so I could see,

27:23.934 --> 27:25.720
speakers to hear.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.553
- But your wife and daughters,
they're in that room now?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.104
- They didn't understand.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.807
This house is wonderful.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.064
What more could they have needed?

27:36.238 --> 27:37.398
- You kept them in there?

27:37.573 --> 27:40.440
- Of course I did!
I did everything for them.

27:40.534 --> 27:43.492
I became this sleepless,
lidless monster for them.

27:46.748 --> 27:48.875
l was supposed
to let them leave me here?

27:48.959 --> 27:50.449
No.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.332
You didn't help me.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.175
You left me like this.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.542
- What?
Why?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.676
- You'd have to ask yourself that.

28:01.763 --> 28:04.300
- I'm not Lucy,
but maybe I can help you now.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.886
- You think that's why
I brought you here?

28:06.977 --> 28:08.763
For your help?

28:08.854 --> 28:11.641
- You had Tina lead us here.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.097
You let my friends in.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.901
- I watched my wife
murder my children.

28:17.070 --> 28:19.197
I felt it.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.025
And it's your fault.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.327
You couldn't save them in time.
You didn't save me.

28:28.957 --> 28:31.994
So now you're gonna watch

28:32.169 --> 28:34.660
your loved ones kill each other.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.556
(metal clinks)

28:52.064 --> 28:54.225
- I told you so.
It's too strong!

28:54.316 --> 28:57.900
- Oh, I forgot you were an expert
on evil architecture.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.193
- We've been through this before, Vince.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.444
- Let's hear it.

29:02.324 --> 29:06.158
- 27 years ago,
Lucy went into this house.

29:06.328 --> 29:09.741
- She almost died.
- So what do we do now?

29:09.873 --> 29:13.206
- We've got to go big.
Really hurt it.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.794
It's their only chance in there.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.499
- We might kill them ourselves
if we're not careful.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.080
- If we do nothing,
they're dead anyway.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.544
There's no other choice.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.754
- You got any potassium nitrate
in your truck?

29:23.929 --> 29:26.045
And a flint?
- Oh, forget that.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.130
You got C4 in there, right?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.299
- You want to build a bomb?
- Yeah!

29:48.412 --> 29:49.652
- Audrey!

29:49.746 --> 29:51.611
This house is trying to split us up.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.405
- lt's moving. I don't know how.

29:53.583 --> 29:55.084
- It's alive.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.908
lt's Roland Holloway.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.122
He's possessed it
and he's trying to turn us on each other.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.710
- What? Why?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.375
- Revenge against Lucy.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.798
This room is causing me flashbacks.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.760
If I can get inside,
then I... I think I can find a way out.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.718
Lucy did.
- You can't go back in there.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.178
That subdural hematoma
that that flashback caused,

30:16.356 --> 30:19.268
it could kill you
if you keep pushing it.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.851
- If I don't do something,
this house is gonna kill us.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.520
Claire, listen,
I need you to stop them

30:24.698 --> 30:27.906
from turning on each other, okay?
No one can do that better than you.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.691
- Who's gonna protect you in there?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.406
- | Will.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.116
- How? Are you a doctor?

30:34.291 --> 30:36.532
- No, I'm a cop,
but you are a doctor,

30:36.710 --> 30:39.827
so you're gonna tell me
exactly what it is I need to do.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.209
- Shh.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.961
- Who pushed me?

30:50.057 --> 30:52.924
Claire? Duke?

30:53.101 --> 30:56.184
- I don't know... yet.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.097
- Well, I don't have any fans
in this house.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.980
- That's not true.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.018
I'm gonna get something for that cut.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.794
- What's up, doc?

31:38.146 --> 31:40.603
- You don't have to be here, Tommy.

31:40.690 --> 31:44.228
- Claire told me to pull you out
if you start to fall, bleed, or seize.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.481
- Thank you.

31:47.656 --> 31:49.271
- Anyway, I know what it's like

31:49.366 --> 31:51.277
to have a past you're running from,
you know.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.108
- If we ever get out of here,

31:54.538 --> 31:56.369
you should tell me
about that sometime.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.571
- Count on it.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.203
- He's not gonna let us
out of here...

32:05.382 --> 32:07.088
Unless, maybe, we help him.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.171
- No.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.877
No, I won't help him.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.464
He killed his wife and daughters.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.678
God only knows
what else he could take over,

32:17.853 --> 32:19.593
who else he could kill.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.183
He's trapped in here

32:22.357 --> 32:25.224
and we're gonna make
this place his prison, James.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.529
- He can see us everywhere we go in here.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.277
What the hell are we going to do?

32:39.374 --> 32:42.081
- I've got an idea.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.665
- Audrey.
Audrey, are you okay?

32:48.175 --> 32:50.712
- I think I know a way
we can get out of here.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.848
- Why would I want to hurt you?

32:55.932 --> 32:57.513
- You think I'm a killer.

32:57.684 --> 32:58.514
- No.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.050
I don't.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.854
I think you're a decent person
whose anger makes her dangerous.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.231
- Only to people who deserve it.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.608
Like that pig who violated me,

33:08.695 --> 33:10.902
triggered my curse,
and left me like this.

33:11.072 --> 33:14.860
I'm a human taser. You don't think
I have the right to be angry?

33:15.035 --> 33:17.321
- I didn't say that, Jordan. You do.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.533
- I think you need
to put down that gun.

33:25.128 --> 33:28.120
- You should have just shot me, Crocker.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.381
(gun clicks)
- Duke.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.678
- If you want my gun,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.963
- No, Nathan.

33:40.393 --> 33:43.305
- I'm sensing some tension?

33:45.982 --> 33:48.189
Listen, this house

33:48.360 --> 33:50.351
and everything in it is alive.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.732
It's what hurt you.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.360
And it's what's turning us on each other.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.111
The mirrors are the eyes,
the intercoms are the ears.

34:01.289 --> 34:04.622
Who's gonna help me to make it deaf and blind
so we can all escape?

34:14.594 --> 34:16.300
- Very good.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.265
You remembered... Lucy.

34:20.642 --> 34:22.473
- l'm Audrey.

34:22.644 --> 34:24.259
Lucy and l are a lot alike.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.478
She didn't fail to save you.

34:26.648 --> 34:27.933
- Oh, she did.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.440
- No, she chose not to.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.271
And I'm gonna choose
the same thing.

34:32.362 --> 34:36.321
Stay in your prison forever.
(gunshots)

34:45.500 --> 34:47.491
- Is that gas?

34:47.669 --> 34:50.081
So what, he can't see us,
he's gonna poison us?

34:55.135 --> 34:57.842
(house rumbles)

34:59.973 --> 35:01.679
- I know you guys are experts
at this Troubley stuff,

35:01.850 --> 35:03.886
but I think it's time
we got the hell out of here.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.676
- Any ideas how to do that?
- Look.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.272
Door to this room.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.680
Wasn't there before.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.143
- We wounded him.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.646
He's losing control.
He can't hide all the doors.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.230
- Which means
it's probably the way out.

35:15.322 --> 35:16.528
- So why don't we just go?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.526
We'll go and find
the front door right now.

35:18.617 --> 35:19.527
- You should.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.316
After I clear a path.

35:21.494 --> 35:24.577
l'll shoot out every mirror and box
| see, blind him.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.033
- He's gonna come after you
with all he's got.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.833
- That's the idea. I distract him,
put all his attention on me,

35:29.919 --> 35:33.161
and you guys make a break for the front door.
Hopefully, he doesn't spot you.

35:34.174 --> 35:37.132
You go with them.
I'm faster on my own.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.631
I could use some extra firepower though.

35:44.601 --> 35:45.886
- I'll go with you.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.426
- You gotta get them out.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.773
Give me a 20-second head start.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.358
Meet you at the front door.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.818
(house rumbles)

36:03.203 --> 36:05.945
(gunshots, glass shatters)

36:08.083 --> 36:09.664
- Let's go.

36:33.817 --> 36:35.102
- We gotta hurry.
(gunfire)

36:35.193 --> 36:36.182
They're getting killed in there!

36:52.711 --> 36:54.576
- There's the front door.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.205
Go!

37:06.433 --> 37:07.923
- Go! Go!

37:10.395 --> 37:13.262
- Seriously? That was your plan?
You were gonna blow us up?

37:13.440 --> 37:16.398
- Hey, it's got a ten-second timer, okay?
Where's Nathan?

37:16.568 --> 37:17.728
- He's still inside.

37:18.611 --> 37:21.193
(house rumbles)

37:22.490 --> 37:23.354
- Nathan!

37:27.579 --> 37:28.910
- Nathan, run!

37:44.053 --> 37:46.465
- This... this is your fault!

37:47.807 --> 37:50.549
Go!
(Duke): Come on!

38:21.508 --> 38:24.090
- The Colorado kid
was in that room with Lucy.

38:24.177 --> 38:27.089
I heard his first name,
I matched it with a facial composite

38:27.263 --> 38:29.094
and I got this.

38:29.265 --> 38:33.258
- James Cogan.
That's his name.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.388
(phone rings)

38:38.566 --> 38:39.681
- Excuse me.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.367
So, that prisoner transfer
that you helped Jordan with,

38:51.454 --> 38:53.285
that was really an escape?

38:53.456 --> 38:54.957
- Yeah.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.118
- You could go to jail for that, Nathan.
What were you thinking?

38:59.295 --> 39:01.877
- l was investigating.
The bolt-gun killer, your abductor,

39:01.965 --> 39:03.705
has the tattoo.
I am in with them.

39:03.883 --> 39:06.841
- You're helping with jail breaks?

39:08.346 --> 39:12.589
And... she knows
that you're undercover too?

39:13.560 --> 39:17.098
It just seems like you're doing
a little more than investigating.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.058
- That prisoner was Troubled.

39:19.232 --> 39:21.063
People would have been hurt
if he had stayed.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.316
The Guard helps Troubled people
just like we do.

39:23.486 --> 39:27.775
- Not like we do.
- It's not black and white, good and bad.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.531
She's not... bad. She's...

39:33.162 --> 39:34.823
She's like me.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.955
- Do you trust her?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.001
-ldo.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.714
- Okay, that's good enough for me.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.170
- Parker.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.503
- It's good, Nathan, all right?
It's good work.

39:51.681 --> 39:53.763
I got some things
that I need to look into

39:53.933 --> 39:56.845
so I'll just, you know...
I'll check in later.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.601
- Yeah.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.016
Check in later.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.660
- Thought maybe you'd call.

40:22.587 --> 40:25.920
- You find anything
in your big investigation so far?

40:27.342 --> 40:29.048
- So far...

40:35.725 --> 40:37.306
You.

40:40.063 --> 40:42.975
- I haven't told the others
that you're really...

40:43.733 --> 40:45.849
investigating us...

40:46.694 --> 40:48.070
yet.

40:51.574 --> 40:54.156
It's not too late
for you to get out.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.705
- Do I have to?

41:06.589 --> 41:08.625
- What are you doing, Nathan?

41:10.218 --> 41:12.630
- I'm gonna catch a serial killer.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.962
You're gonna help.

41:17.225 --> 41:18.635
You're right.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.301
It started as a lie with us,

41:23.481 --> 41:25.517
but it's not anymore.

41:27.443 --> 41:29.183
Not for me.

41:31.197 --> 41:32.858
- You know...

41:34.367 --> 41:38.576
everyone says that my curse
is that my touch hurts people.

41:38.913 --> 41:41.120
But that's not it.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.497
- It's that you can't be touched.

41:46.838 --> 41:48.294
- Yeah.

42:46.314 --> 42:49.147
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
