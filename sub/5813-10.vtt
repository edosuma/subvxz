WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:04.422
We did this, Sam.
We broke it, we bought it.

00:04.630 --> 00:08.055
I unleashed a force on this world
that could destroy it.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.658
All I know is that we set her free,

00:09.760 --> 00:11.960
and we're gonna put her back in
no matter what it takes.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.794
In order to create the world,

00:43.961 --> 00:48.011
God, he had to betray The Darkness.
His sister.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.181
What was that?

00:52.344 --> 00:55.268
The future. We're bonded.
You're the one who set me free.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.773
No, that was an accident.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.149
It was destiny.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.319
I can't be resisted.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.238
There's this cage, in Hell.
And it's where they keep Lucifer.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.996
And I've been in it.
And I think God wants me to go back.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.747
He's so alpha.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.785
That wasn't God inside your head, Sam.
It was me.

01:15.993 --> 01:21.375
He's never been with you.
It was always just me.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.341
I guess I am your only hope.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.919
It's never gonna happen.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.678
Settle in there, buddy.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.353
Boy, oh, boy!

01:47.608 --> 01:49.485
Mom! Mom! I got a Sam!

01:54.031 --> 01:55.829
Good for you, dearie.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.467
Santa!

02:09.630 --> 02:11.382
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

02:11.673 --> 02:13.175
Merry Christmas!

02:13.342 --> 02:15.219
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

02:15.385 --> 02:17.353
What'd you bring me? What'd you bring me?

02:17.512 --> 02:20.106
Ooh, let's see what
Santa's got for you today.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.072
But I was a good boy.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.664
Really, Rowena?
This is what you dream about?

02:44.539 --> 02:47.042
It's more of
a recurring nightmare, actually.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.423
These don't come off!

02:51.588 --> 02:54.262
I've been having this dream
for months, but

02:54.466 --> 02:55.934
you,

02:56.218 --> 02:57.219
you're new.

02:58.804 --> 02:59.805
Who are you?

03:00.639 --> 03:03.108
Yeah, sorry, my manners are a bit rusty.

03:20.367 --> 03:21.459
You.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.794
The visions.

03:26.581 --> 03:28.128
Everything.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.634
It was all you.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.132
Impressive, right?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.047
And Rowena?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.391
Did as she was told.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.808
Groupies, they're always so eager.

03:42.097 --> 03:44.941
So you did all of that just to...

03:46.393 --> 03:47.690
To what? Jump my bones?

03:48.437 --> 03:49.654
Literally.

03:49.813 --> 03:53.818
Well, you wasted your time, then.
'Cause, see, I know how this ends.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.244
Oh, do you now?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.701
Yeah. You'll taunt me,

03:59.322 --> 04:02.667
and you'll torture me, and I'll say no.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.167
And eventually, sooner than you think,

04:06.455 --> 04:08.958
my brother's gonna walk through that door
and kick your ass.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.840
Dean.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.925
You're betting on Dean?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.805
I always have.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.759
Hmm.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.971
Oh, Sam. You've got me all wrong.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.523
I doubt that.

04:24.681 --> 04:27.184
No, I'm not here to torture you.

04:28.185 --> 04:29.357
I mean, I could.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.689
I could inflict

04:33.815 --> 04:35.408
pain like you can't even imagine.

04:35.609 --> 04:40.661
I could inflict such delicious,
perfect pain.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.998
But that was so five years ago.

04:47.037 --> 04:51.668
No, I'm not gonna harm a glorious little
hair on that glorious little head.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.553
Then what do you want?

04:54.711 --> 04:57.055
To make you an offer you can't refuse.

04:57.547 --> 05:02.553
You see, Sam, you need me.
And I'm gonna prove it to you.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.106
Recognize it?

05:10.811 --> 05:11.903
What?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.315
We're in a memory, Sam.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.074
One of the few good ones
from your childhood.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.278
By the way, I thought I had daddy issues,

05:19.444 --> 05:23.074
but, you.  Wow. Anyway,

05:24.366 --> 05:27.540
I think you recognize the dashing young
beanpole over there.

05:31.957 --> 05:32.958
That's me.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.214
You're dead.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.180
Please, Fergus, enough with idle threats.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.934
You betrayed me. In my kingdom!

05:47.138 --> 05:51.769
Not in yours, his. Hell is his. I'm his.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.103
So hurt me, and what do you think
he'll do to you?

05:54.229 --> 05:56.948
Lucifer will never get out of that cell.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.288
You're willing to stake your life
on that? On Sam Winchester?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.497
How long?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.959
How long have you been working for him?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.630
Not long. Lucifer came to me in a dream.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.967
Not that kind of dream.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.726
So you're just gonna let
the big strong man boss you around.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.986
Whatever happened to the Super-Duper
Awesome Coven hashtag "girlpower"?

06:34.269 --> 06:37.773
Lucifer's no man, he's perfection.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.035
Why do you think
I let your droogs find me?

06:42.819 --> 06:44.492
Lucifer has a plan, and...

06:44.654 --> 06:46.406
And he's the Devil.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.331
You say that like it's a bad thing.

06:50.493 --> 06:53.622
Oh, I'm a bad thing. He's a worse thing.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.062
The last time Lucifer went topside,
do you know what he wanted?

06:58.752 --> 06:59.753
Death.

06:59.961 --> 07:04.011
For you. For me.
And every human and every demon.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.183
He's changed.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.890
Oh, yes. Of course.

07:08.094 --> 07:11.018
All he needed was the love
of a horrible woman.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.192
So. And you're doing all this why?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.570
Out of the goodness of your heart?

07:21.816 --> 07:23.864
Don't be daft.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.868
After Lucifer stops The Darkness,

07:27.614 --> 07:29.241
he'll ascend to his throne

07:30.492 --> 07:31.869
in Heaven.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.835
And I'll be by his side. A loyal follower.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.209
A queen?

07:38.375 --> 07:41.128
Like it or not, you know I'm right.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.135
Lucifer fought The Darkness before,

07:44.381 --> 07:45.382
and he won.

07:46.174 --> 07:50.896
So, unless you've got
the Almighty in your back pocket,

07:51.221 --> 07:57.479
I suggest you sit down, shut up,
and let him work.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.947
Oh, hey, Sam can't talk right now
'cause he's waxing, like, everything.

08:13.952 --> 08:14.952
But leave a message...

08:15.036 --> 08:16.083
Dude, what are you doing
with my phone?

08:16.413 --> 08:17.881
Dean? Come on.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.632
Call me. Now.

08:25.088 --> 08:29.389
Thank you for phoning Crowley,
King of Hell. For Demon Deals, press one.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.600
To report a sighting of that ginger whore,
Rowena, press two.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.417
Dean?

08:57.078 --> 08:59.297
I came as soon as you called.
Are you all right?

09:00.498 --> 09:01.624
Cass?

09:11.926 --> 09:13.303
You're not all right.

09:13.553 --> 09:19.981
Obviously. What's wrong with me?
What are you doing? What are you...

09:20.351 --> 09:21.477
Stick out your tongue.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.736
What?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.694
All right, are we done?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.618
No, I'm gonna take your temperature.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.037
Nope, that's not gonna happen.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.832
How far are we from the event?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.122
You mean, the angel nuke?

09:37.285 --> 09:38.286
Yeah.

09:38.453 --> 09:40.330
Ground zero's about a mile down that way.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.633
Okay. That explains it.
You're suffering from smiting sickness.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.262
- That's a thing?
- Yeah.

09:47.962 --> 09:51.341
The angels, what they did,
it released a tremendous amount of energy.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.011
And there's fallout.
So this whole area's poisoned.

09:54.177 --> 09:57.181
- You can heal me, right?
- No, I can't.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.562
And the closer you get to the blast site,
the worse your sickness will become.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.186
How worse?

10:02.352 --> 10:05.196
The last time there was a smiting
of this magnitude,

10:06.314 --> 10:07.861
Lot's wife turned to salt.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.112
Awesome.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.698
All right, Dean. You need to go back.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.366
Uh, no. Ah.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.912
No, no, we gotta,

10:20.703 --> 10:23.582
we gotta go see if it worked,
see if Amara's alive or dead.

10:24.040 --> 10:27.465
We don't. The fallout
doesn't affect angels. I'll go in alone.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.893
Okay, yeah. It's probably better that way.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.929
I'll take a drive, I'll go check on Sam.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.065
All right. Good.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.059
Hey, Cass.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.360
If it did work and she is dead,

10:49.858 --> 10:50.905
bring her body out.

10:52.694 --> 10:53.866
And if she's not?

10:56.906 --> 10:57.953
Run.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.594
So, the Aztec priests, they thought
if they didn't sacrifice people,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.717
the whole world would end.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.926
So they built all of these temples.
The most amazing ones are in Mexico City.

11:16.926 --> 11:17.973
You've seen them?

11:18.136 --> 11:20.889
Last year. My dad took me and my brother
on a trip to Mexico.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.603
On vacation?

11:22.765 --> 11:25.005
Kind of a working vacation.

11:25.059 --> 11:27.608
Have you ever heard of a chupacabra?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.771
No.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.190
Okay, good.

11:31.274 --> 11:36.155
Look at that, Sam.
A simple girl from a one-stoplight town.

11:36.988 --> 11:38.956
And you, the worldly,

11:39.532 --> 11:42.627
handsome-ish Sam Winchester.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.131
She didn't stand a chance. You remember?

11:46.289 --> 11:47.962
Yeah. Why are you...

11:48.124 --> 11:50.126
This is the best part.

11:50.460 --> 11:55.967
Sam, you know I didn't bring you here
to study, right?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.643
You didn't?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.136
No.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.305
I mean...

12:02.513 --> 12:07.485
I just think that
you're smart and funny and cute.

12:08.978 --> 12:13.108
So, I mean, if you wanna make out...

12:15.777 --> 12:19.748
Boom! That's it! That's what
I'm talking about, right there, man!

12:22.825 --> 12:24.042
Kissing?

12:24.369 --> 12:27.999
No. Sam, this is
the Sam Winchester that I remember.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.334
Bold, decisive,

12:31.626 --> 12:33.549
a solid B on the tongue action.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.139
What is this about?

12:36.297 --> 12:41.144
You used to be a hero, Sam.
Hell, you beat me. Now...

12:43.304 --> 12:46.023
I don't know, I look at you,
I don't even recognize you anymore.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.695
Sam?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.278
Sammy?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.375
You son of a bitch.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.540
- Miss you too, puddin'.
- Where are you?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.708
Where's Sam?

13:11.916 --> 13:13.589
Ah. There's a bit of a hiccup.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.173
Your brother's in Hell.

13:15.962 --> 13:16.963
With Lucifer.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.649
Stull Cemetery.

13:32.979 --> 13:37.075
Bingo. Where the title fight went down.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.902
Hey, ass-butt!

13:46.534 --> 13:49.333
"Ass-butt."
I still don't get that.

13:51.581 --> 13:53.701
Look, I appreciate the stroll
down memory lane, but...

13:53.708 --> 13:55.710
Sam, have I ever told you
how much I respect you?

13:57.128 --> 13:58.129
What?

13:58.296 --> 14:01.049
Oh, don't get me wrong, I don't like you.
I've never liked you.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.434
You're sort of prissy.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.891
But in this moment,

14:06.095 --> 14:08.018
when you stood toe-to-toe with me and won?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.442
I gotta say, you had balls, kid.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.739
It's okay, Dean. It's gonna be okay.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.864
I got him.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.577
You were willing to do the hard thing
if it meant saving the world.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.456
No!

14:41.506 --> 14:42.974
That's not you anymore.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.844
You gone soft, Sammy.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.994
Oh!

15:12.453 --> 15:13.705
Who are you?

15:14.163 --> 15:19.044
Ambriel. I work in birth-death statistics.
In Heaven. I'm an angel.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.174
Yeah, I know.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.596
And you're Castiel?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.849
I've heard stories about you.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.350
Why are you here?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.398
The same reason you are.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.568
Heaven wants to know
if The Darkness has been destroyed?

15:40.398 --> 15:41.820
Pretty much.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.070
And they sent you?

15:46.028 --> 15:47.496
Are you gonna kill me?

15:47.655 --> 15:49.375
Is that what they say? That I kill angels?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.834
Well, that's the nicest thing they say.

15:53.744 --> 15:57.465
Maybe we can work together?
So no one murders anyone.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.716
Right.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.546
Fine.

16:05.256 --> 16:09.181
Okay, so I've searched the east end
of the forest. Nothing weird.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.187
Really?

16:12.013 --> 16:14.607
You know it is the middle
of the afternoon?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.401
So?

16:17.852 --> 16:19.024
So.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.985
Why is it dark?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.028
Excellent question.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.167
Hey Cass, I know you're fighting
the good fight right now, but, uh...

16:34.494 --> 16:37.919
I need you at Third and Pine,
Kenesaw, Nebraska.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.248
'Cause, uh,

16:40.458 --> 16:41.755
I'm going to Hell.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.052
Password.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.771
Crowley sent me, all right? Just open up.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.061
Password.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.519
Really?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.906
All right, just let me in.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.463
Nice work, Bieber.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.214
Funny, for a demon.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.596
Not a demon. Name's Billie.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.803
The Reaper Billie?

17:31.425 --> 17:33.268
My brother says you want to kill us.

17:33.427 --> 17:38.524
Nah, I'm just gonna make sure
that when you die, you stay dead.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.560
Subtle difference.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.657
So, what, you work for Crowley?

17:46.816 --> 17:48.534
With, not for.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.870
It's strange days, Winchester.

17:53.155 --> 17:57.706
Times like this, doesn't hurt
to have the King owe you a favor.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.454
For the limey.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.965
- What is it?
- You'll see.

18:04.709 --> 18:05.710
Whatever.

18:07.003 --> 18:08.801
All right, just get me
to where I need to go.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.632
That's the plan.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.870
Watch your step. It's a long way down.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.255
You thought about
what you're gonna say to him?

18:55.301 --> 18:57.770
I've thought about it and I've
thought about it, and I still don't know.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.646
This is where it all changed, Sammy.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.979
It's just all so surreal.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.977
This is the worst thing you've ever done.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.729
Does he know they told you
he was killed in action?

19:06.896 --> 19:08.113
Really?

19:09.565 --> 19:15.163
After the Leviathans, when your brother
was trapped in Purgatory, you were here.

19:15.946 --> 19:20.747
With a girl and a dog.
You didn't even bother trying to find him.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.375
You know what?
Not that I have to defend myself to you,

19:23.788 --> 19:26.166
but Dean and I promised
we wouldn't look for each other.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.212
Right. And if he never came back,
you'd be fine.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.260
But he did, so you're not.

19:31.253 --> 19:33.096
Whatever happened to the Sam Winchester

19:33.255 --> 19:38.261
who was bold, decisive, and ready
to sacrifice for the greater good?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
Right here.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.356
And so why did you let Dean talk you
out of closing the Gates of Hell?

19:43.599 --> 19:46.068
'Cause the old Sam
never would have done that. Not ever.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.552
- I didn't...
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.280
Here's my personal favorite,
is you doing every stupid thing

19:50.439 --> 19:53.989
you could to cure the Mark,
even after you knew it would go bad.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.277
My brother was dying!

19:55.444 --> 19:59.074
Yes! And you'd do anything to save him,
and he'd do anything to save you,

19:59.281 --> 20:02.125
and that is the problem. Because of this,

20:02.410 --> 20:05.584
you're so overcome by guilt that
you can't stand to lose Dean again.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.631
And he could never lose you.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.293
And so instead of choosing the world,
you choose each other.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.803
No matter how many innocent people die.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.473
You're gonna lecture me
about hurting people? You?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.134
You know I'm right, Sam.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.220
You know it.

20:22.555 --> 20:27.026
And I know that if you're gonna beat
The Darkness, you have to be ready to die.

20:27.184 --> 20:31.030
You have to be ready to watch
the people you love die.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.548
A long time ago you could have
fought the good fight, kid. But

20:37.486 --> 20:38.487
not anymore.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.285
You can't win this one, Sam.
You're just not strong enough.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.370
And you are?

20:46.162 --> 20:48.836
Hey, snappin' necks and cashin' checks,
it's what I do.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.855
Isn't this nice? Spending quality time.

21:06.474 --> 21:09.023
- Your tea is ready.
- Finally.

21:09.310 --> 21:10.778
That does sound lovely.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.028
How do you take it?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.508
- Honey and a splash of milk.
- Honey and a splash of milk.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.694
Like mother, like son.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.704
Excuse me.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.703
I need to go vomit.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.997
Hurry back, dear.

21:31.373 --> 21:35.970
I never wanted this, you know?
To be hated by my own kind. I never...

21:36.378 --> 21:38.847
Oh, no, I don't hate you, Castiel.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.720
Thank you.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.523
I mean, we have a lot in common.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.271
Our names rhyme. That's a big one.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.517
I look good in a trench coat, too.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.862
And we're both expendable.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.614
Excuse me?

21:56.774 --> 21:59.243
Well, that's why we're here, right?

22:00.236 --> 22:03.957
I'm a number cruncher and you,
like I said, I've heard the stories.

22:04.740 --> 22:08.711
You help, but Sam and Dean Winchester
are the real heroes.

22:10.412 --> 22:14.713
So if The Darkness is still alive,
and she's pissed,

22:15.584 --> 22:16.961
and she kills us,

22:18.462 --> 22:24.435
no big loss. So sure, maybe we're not
super important, but we do the job.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.349
You know?
I think there's nobility in that.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.111
You coming?

22:35.479 --> 22:36.856
Yeah, I'll catch up.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.052
- Welcome to Hell.
- Where's Sam?

23:07.219 --> 23:09.339
- Don't worry about Sam.
- I’m sorry, have you met me?

23:09.471 --> 23:15.069
I mean, Lucifer needs the Moose.
He's not gonna kill him. Probably.

23:16.145 --> 23:17.317
You versus the Devil?

23:17.479 --> 23:19.573
Trust me, there's easier ways
of committing suicide.

23:19.773 --> 23:21.400
We need to focus on Rowena.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.236
Okay, great, let's kill her.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.621
Easier said than done, I'm afraid.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.500
And we need Mother to slam the Devil
back in his hole.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.039
Well, is she gonna play ball?

23:31.285 --> 23:32.753
She doesn't have a choice.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.847
It's called a Witchcatcher.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.467
Most of them were destroyed
after the Inquisition.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.517
But, uh, Billie came through.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.513
Yeah, she's a peach. What does it do?

23:50.804 --> 23:52.306
Oh, you're gonna love this.

24:36.558 --> 24:37.650
Ambriel?

25:25.441 --> 25:26.738
Castiel.

25:27.568 --> 25:30.697
Amara. What did you do to her?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.077
I consumed her.

25:34.241 --> 25:38.747
Her grace, her spark, her memories.

25:39.246 --> 25:44.844
Everything. Oh, she really hit the spot.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.635
Seriously?

25:49.506 --> 25:52.931
I mean, Heaven brought the thunder,
and it barely even scratched my paint job.

25:53.093 --> 25:57.189
But you and a shiny knife?
Sure. That's gonna work.

25:58.015 --> 25:59.437
You think I'm afraid to die?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.059
I know you are.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.484
You reek of fear and self-loathing.

26:07.441 --> 26:08.943
Ooh. Scary.

26:13.530 --> 26:16.659
She's right, you know. You are expendable.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.577
And weak.

26:19.328 --> 26:23.959
And why God took a special interest
in you, I'll never understand.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.005
My brother always did have
horrible taste in men.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.348
Just do it.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.854
Blue-eyes, you aren't
even worth the effort.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.687
And

26:41.016 --> 26:44.020
no offense, but you look a bit used up.

26:46.188 --> 26:47.485
Plus,

26:48.690 --> 26:50.692
I have a job for you.

27:18.887 --> 27:19.934
Hey.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.021
How's Dean?

27:29.606 --> 27:30.823
Pardon?

27:31.150 --> 27:35.656
Little tip, love. The next time you
go about making secret plans,

27:36.572 --> 27:38.290
check your pockets.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.833
I need to go vomit.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.422
Hurry back, dear.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.142
- You heard.
- Everything.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.399
Not that it matters.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.189
And what does that mean, big boy?

28:07.436 --> 28:11.942
A little tip, Mother. Never accept a cup
of tea from someone who loathes you.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.922
Get this bloody thing off of me!

28:27.080 --> 28:30.004
Oh, I would, but "this bloody thing"
makes you my slave.

28:32.336 --> 28:33.963
Hop on one foot.

28:34.296 --> 28:38.142
Please, Fergus, I don't know what kind of
Oedipal Fifty Shades

28:38.300 --> 28:40.803
you think you're playing at,
but if you think for a second...

28:48.310 --> 28:49.527
Bollocks.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.022
All right, let's do this.

28:53.941 --> 28:57.536
Now, Sam.
I know this was a lot to take in,

28:57.694 --> 28:59.992
so if you need to
take some time

29:00.155 --> 29:01.657
and noodle on it, that's cool.

29:02.532 --> 29:05.376
But, uh, world is ending,

29:05.827 --> 29:10.048
clock ticking and such.
Do you follow me?

29:10.707 --> 29:12.175
What do you want me to say?

29:12.501 --> 29:16.847
A little word that starts with "Y,"
ends in "yes."

29:18.465 --> 29:20.263
Okay, you don't like me.

29:21.426 --> 29:25.522
I get it, I get it.
Sometimes I don't like me, either.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.896
But Gabriel and Raphael are dead,

29:29.017 --> 29:34.695
God went out for a pack of smokes
and never came back, and Michael...

29:37.150 --> 29:40.120
Well, let's just say prison life
hasn't really agreed with Michael.

29:40.696 --> 29:46.203
These days he's usually sitting
in a corner singing show tunes and

29:46.410 --> 29:48.128
touching himself.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.208
So, you're it.

29:52.874 --> 29:53.875
I'm it.

29:54.543 --> 29:58.844
And hey, I'm not the good guy.
We, we both know I'm not.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.179
But The Darkness?

30:02.509 --> 30:04.261
She's the end of everything.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.020
But I can beat her.

30:10.017 --> 30:13.396
We can beat her. You and me.

30:14.229 --> 30:18.405
Together. So come on, Sam.

30:18.775 --> 30:24.077
Make the right choice, the big sacrifice,
one more time, man.

30:25.574 --> 30:26.621
Sam.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.417
It's time to save the world, man.

30:40.672 --> 30:41.719
No.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.092
No.

30:48.597 --> 30:49.917
So, this spell that's supposed to

30:50.057 --> 30:52.560
slam Lucifer back in the box,
how long's this gonna take?

30:53.435 --> 30:54.607
About five minutes.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.656
Unless Sam says "yes."

30:59.107 --> 31:00.108
And if he does?

31:00.275 --> 31:02.949
If Lucifer finds a vessel,
he'll be anchored to Earth.

31:04.446 --> 31:05.948
The incantation won't work.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.787
And then we're screwed.

31:11.453 --> 31:13.797
I'm sorry, my lord. I tried to...

31:13.997 --> 31:14.998
Cass?

31:15.207 --> 31:16.880
Oh good, the angel's here.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.085
What's happened?

31:18.335 --> 31:22.511
Amara, she's,
she's alive. She...

31:24.633 --> 31:25.634
She sent this message.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.976
Is that a threat?

31:31.098 --> 31:32.600
Or a promise?

31:34.976 --> 31:36.319
What do you mean, "No"?

31:36.895 --> 31:37.942
You heard me.

31:39.398 --> 31:42.618
Okay, now, Sam, I gotta tell you,
this is selfish, man. Everything that...

31:42.776 --> 31:44.323
You are done. It's over.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.206
You know what?

31:50.367 --> 31:52.790
You talk a good game. You do.

31:52.953 --> 31:55.923
Hell, you almost had me sold a few times.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.007
But then I thought, what if you're right?

31:58.166 --> 32:00.168
What if you're telling the truth?
What if you can beat her?

32:00.335 --> 32:01.837
I can!

32:02.337 --> 32:06.092
Even though last time it took you
plus three other archangels.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.018
Oh, yeah, and capital "G" God.

32:09.177 --> 32:11.475
Oh, okay, what? You mean the dead weight?

32:11.638 --> 32:14.357
Well, let's say you gank her. Then what?

32:16.101 --> 32:17.819
I move to LA. Solve crimes?

32:17.978 --> 32:19.025
Wrong.

32:19.604 --> 32:22.483
Then you go about
starting the Apocalypse again.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.114
Because you're an old dog,
and that's your old trick.

32:25.402 --> 32:28.622
Okay. First off, you don't know that.

32:28.864 --> 32:33.870
Second, even if I did,
that's better than what she has planned.

32:34.244 --> 32:36.372
Is it? Really?

32:37.372 --> 32:38.544
Because this is what I think.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.049
I think that whoever wins,

32:40.208 --> 32:43.883
you or The Darkness, everyone else loses.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.299
So, no.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.556
My answer is no.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.645
This isn't 'cause of Dean, or the past.

32:55.807 --> 33:01.485
This is about me having faith in
my friends, having faith in my family.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.617
We will find a way.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.205
I'm ready to die.

33:11.865 --> 33:14.789
And I'm ready to watch people I love die.

33:16.578 --> 33:18.956
But I'm not ready to be your bitch.

33:24.920 --> 33:25.967
Okay.

33:26.755 --> 33:27.927
Plan B.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.101
Sam!

33:33.637 --> 33:34.638
Don't!

33:38.725 --> 33:39.977
Hey, ass-butt!

33:42.854 --> 33:45.232
Dean. Uh, the other one.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.120
Welcome to the party.

34:04.834 --> 34:05.881
Scared?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.549
Not even a little.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.219
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

34:11.967 --> 34:15.597
Moments like this,
it's all about ambiance.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.580
I can beat The Darkness. Me. Only me.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.081
All right.

34:35.322 --> 34:36.916
Who are these two?

34:37.074 --> 34:39.715
They're a couple of apes.
You know I'm right, Castiel. You know it.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.880
You wanna play that way?

34:43.248 --> 34:44.340
We can't win.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.752
We don't have to win,
we just gotta last a few minutes.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.152
You hit like a human.

35:37.052 --> 35:41.478
All right, Sam, I'm gonna make this
real easy for you. You say the magic word,

35:42.515 --> 35:44.017
or your brother dies.

35:44.684 --> 35:47.028
And we both know
you won't let that happen.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.007
So? Last words?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.793
You're welcome!

36:49.416 --> 36:50.463
Anyone?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.719
- Bite me.
- I can make her do that.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.005
So, what now?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.841
About The Darkness? No clue.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.019
- We'll figure it out.
- Or die screaming.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.855
This has been
a horrible train wreck.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.476
So, we're done. Team-up over.

37:07.976 --> 37:09.068
What about her?

37:11.813 --> 37:12.860
She stays.

37:14.816 --> 37:18.821
The rest of you lot,
get the hell out of Hell.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.123
You all right?

37:32.167 --> 37:33.339
I think SO.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.427
I will be.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.715
Can we give you a lift?

37:38.882 --> 37:41.385
No, you two go on ahead. I'll catch up.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.352
Okay.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.369
Is he all right?

38:07.869 --> 38:09.041
Tough day.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.377
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.378
You good?

38:15.627 --> 38:16.924
I don't know.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.030
I mean, what if Lucifer
was telling the truth? What if he's...

38:21.049 --> 38:23.723
No, dude. Darkness is bad.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.974
Her and the Devil? That's a nightmare.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.532
Mother,

38:39.901 --> 38:41.699
why do you hate me?

38:45.573 --> 38:50.079
I hate you because
when I look into your eyes,

38:50.245 --> 38:52.748
I see the woman I used to be.

38:52.914 --> 38:55.542
Before magic. Before the Coven.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.421
When I was nothing but Rowena,
the tanner's daughter.

39:00.004 --> 39:05.181
A pale, scared little girl
who smelled of filth and death.

39:07.387 --> 39:11.267
I hate you because when you were born,

39:12.392 --> 39:14.315
your father said he loved me.

39:14.519 --> 39:18.319
Then he went back to his grand wife
and his grand house,

39:18.773 --> 39:22.619
whilst I lay pathetic and half-dead
on a straw mat,

39:22.777 --> 39:24.620
my thighs slick with blood.

39:26.781 --> 39:31.082
I hate you because if I didn't,

39:32.662 --> 39:36.132
I'd love you. But love,

39:37.208 --> 39:39.006
love is weakness.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.223
And I'll never be weak again.

39:51.431 --> 39:52.557
Castiel?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.325
Guess again.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.784
No.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.448
Last words?

40:08.948 --> 40:10.165
Can you really beat her?

40:10.325 --> 40:12.168
- I can.
- Then yes.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.172
Lucifer.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.793
I'm back, baby.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.842
It can't be! You finished the spell!

40:24.172 --> 40:26.641
But if he was already in another vessel...

40:26.841 --> 40:28.093
Loophole.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.179
Bloody hell.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.596
Uh-uh.

40:35.516 --> 40:36.517
Ooh.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.604
Rowena.

40:40.480 --> 40:41.732
My liege.

40:42.190 --> 40:48.118
You know, what you've done for me,
I'll never forget it.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.122
'Twas my honor.

40:51.908 --> 40:53.205
Yes.

40:54.994 --> 40:57.622
"'Twas." You deserve

40:58.539 --> 40:59.711
a reward.

41:01.793 --> 41:05.923
Or some little token

41:07.215 --> 41:08.717
of my affection.

41:08.883 --> 41:10.556
I thank you.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.680
Oh.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.149
Just one teensy, tiny little question.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.062
Can anyone else open the cage?

41:23.898 --> 41:25.115
Just me.

41:26.901 --> 41:28.027
Good.

41:49.924 --> 41:50.925
Okay.

41:54.762 --> 41:55.763
Let's chat.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.549
English - SDH
