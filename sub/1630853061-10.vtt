going on in our lives,

00:57.508 --> 00:59.691

to check in with each other.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.795
Just had so much
on my mind lately.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.881

pre-chat about the things

01:05.999 --> 01:08.817

You're right.
- Hey, look, man, I'm sorry.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.499
But when I make
somebody a promise,

01:23.617 --> 01:24.483
I do my best to keep it.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.086
It's part of my code,

even when you don't wrestle?

07:36.623 --> 07:38.490
- Yeah, you betcha.

07:38.575 --> 07:40.659
- Hey, uh, you're paying
for this next round too, right?

07:40.794 --> 07:44.246
- Actually,
next round is on sears.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.580
You know, I get
that big store opening

07:45.699 --> 07:48.333
tomorrow, so I can't go
too crazy tonight.

07:48.919 --> 07:50.669
- I got you.
- I'm good, son.

07:50.754 --> 07:52.170
Hey, you wanna be useful,

07:52.306 --> 07:53.505
come help me
carry these drinks.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.476
- So, ata,
how are you guys doing?

07:57.561 --> 07:58.510
Huh?

07:59.596 --> 08:00.178
I didn't want to ask rocky,
'cause you know him.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.514
He'll always spin it.
- We're all right.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.349
Somehow, the bills
always get paid.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.734
[chuckles]

08:05.853 --> 08:08.854
rocky's working nonstop,
but he never complains.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.022
- Hey, if you didn't
order fernet,

08:11.158 --> 08:12.023
I got you one anyway.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.859
All: [chuckle]

08:13.994 --> 08:15.076
- hey...

08:15.195 --> 08:16.111
To sears.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.412
- [chuckling] oh, sears.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.114
Best place on earth.
[glasses clink]

08:19.232 --> 08:20.665
- that was so much fun!

08:20.767 --> 08:22.133
- We have to do it again.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.169
- [chuckles] yes,
and just us next time.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.204
- Oh, perfect.
I need a night off

08:26.306 --> 08:27.906
from thinking about wrestlers
and wrestling.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.307
- We'll leave all that at home.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.809
We'll be like
500 pounds lighter.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.244
[both laugh]

08:32.346 --> 08:34.412
- and after that,
I never watched another thing

08:34.515 --> 08:36.081
bea arthur did.
[laughs]

08:36.183 --> 08:37.048
- it makes sense.
Makes sense.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.768
Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Anything, kid.

08:39.887 --> 08:41.136
- Could you talk to my dad,

08:41.254 --> 08:42.888
try and convince him
to apologize to vince

08:43.023 --> 08:45.290
so he can get back
in the wwf?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.441
I bet he'll listen to you.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.893
- He'll never do it,
little brother.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.529
You know your dad and his code.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.447
Honestly,
even if he did apologize,

08:52.566 --> 08:53.782
I don't think it would matter.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.283
That chapter is closed.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.168
- He's given everything
to wrestling,

08:57.271 --> 08:59.321
and now that he's getting
older, that's it?

08:59.439 --> 09:01.706
- I get it.
It's a tough business.

09:01.808 --> 09:04.543
You want stability,
you work at state farm.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.212
Look, have a little faith
in your old man.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.131
He's a fighter.
He'll always end up on a--

09:10.250 --> 09:11.216
[sign rattles]

09:11.301 --> 09:12.717
[chuckles]

09:12.803 --> 09:15.954
that is what happens when
you wear sunglasses at night.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.256
Ooh yeah!

09:18.392 --> 09:20.342
<i> - Talking to macho man</i>
<i> had me questioning</i>

09:20.460 --> 09:22.093
<i> the cost of my dad's code.</i>

09:22.229 --> 09:23.395
Jeff jarrett knows
that's his bad shoulder.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.813
- It's like mama said.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.731
Sometimes it "bes" that way.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.568
[arm thuds]
- man,

09:29.653 --> 09:31.236
my dad brings it
every night,

09:31.321 --> 09:32.704
and he has
nothing to show for it.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.239
- [groaning]

09:34.324 --> 09:35.440
- I'm going to be
the one to make sure my dad

09:35.525 --> 09:37.275
doesn't retire broke
and crippled.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.581
- I bet your daddy
don't regret a second.

09:42.666 --> 09:43.832
And neither do I,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.116
because the wrestling business

09:45.202 --> 09:46.835
is the greatest in the world,
dewey.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.204
Do you know that I could walk
into a restaurant,

09:49.322 --> 09:52.123
and that entire place
will start booing me?

09:52.209 --> 09:53.291
Last week, I had a little kid,

09:53.427 --> 09:54.542
maybe nine years old,
came up to me,

09:54.661 --> 09:57.379
and he hated me so much,
he spit in my face.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.880
You know how beautiful that is?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.515
To move somebody in that way?

10:00.634 --> 10:01.800
And that,

10:01.885 --> 10:03.184
that is wrestling.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.936
[rock music playing]

10:05.022 --> 10:06.471
- [groans]

10:07.357 --> 10:09.107
- and that's my cue.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.310
- Who let this slimeball
in the building?

10:12.412 --> 10:15.513
[crowd booing]

10:16.883 --> 10:18.617
[body thuds]
- [groans]

10:18.719 --> 10:19.951
<i> - so that's when you decided</i>

10:20.037 --> 10:21.319
<i> you wanted</i>
<i> to take a different path.</i>

10:21.421 --> 10:22.704
You found football.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.872
- That's right, and when
I started playing football,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.408
I realized that, well,
I'm pretty good at this game,

10:26.526 --> 10:28.460
and it became
an opportunity for me

10:28.545 --> 10:30.829
to make money,
possibly make a lot of money,

10:30.964 --> 10:32.914
and most importantly,
take care of my family.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.382
- Man, imagine how much better

10:34.501 --> 10:35.767
you would have been
at wrestling

10:35.869 --> 10:37.419
if you didn't waste
all that time on football.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.504
- Imagine how much better
you'd be in journalism

10:39.589 --> 10:41.256
had you not wasted
all that time being an actor.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.641
- Touché.
- Touché.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.776
- But I'm
a good interviewer, right?

10:44.878 --> 10:46.911
- [quietly] nobody's perfect.
- Oh.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.615
- Without further ado,
I'd like to ask

10:51.184 --> 10:51.933
.
Randy "macho man" savage

10:52.052 --> 10:53.218
to do the honors.

10:53.303 --> 10:57.255
[crowd cheers and applauds]

10:57.357 --> 11:00.025
- yeah!
When I was a macho boy,

11:00.127 --> 11:03.161
I thought that stores
only specialized in one thing.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.798
If you needed hardware,
you went to the hardware store.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.234
You needed books,
you went to the bookstore.

11:09.319 --> 11:11.469
Then I found sears,

11:11.571 --> 11:13.838
and it changed my life!
Yeah!

11:13.940 --> 11:16.908
- That's very nice.
- I freaking love sears, yeah!

11:17.010 --> 11:18.176
I will come at--
- let's cut that ribbon.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.761
- [laughs]
all right.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.981
Let the savage savings

11:23.083 --> 11:24.282
begin, yeah!

11:24.384 --> 11:26.051
[crowd cheers]
whoo!

11:26.153 --> 11:27.786
Ooh yeah!

11:27.888 --> 11:29.454
Welcome to sears!

11:29.556 --> 11:32.023
Hey, congratulations,
you're in sears.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.992
Enjoy your sears experience.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.261
Savings, beckons
the macho man!

11:36.363 --> 11:38.246
- Does randy savage
work here?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.098
- No.
No, he does not.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.300
- Hey,
come down with that pillow.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.738
- Rocky johnson,
we finally meet.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.040
John jarvis, promoter.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.542
Jerry lawler
might have mentioned me.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.210
- Jerry did say something
about a new guy

11:52.312 --> 11:54.212
doing big things out here.
- That would be me.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.314
Wondering if you're free
to headline for me this weekend

11:56.450 --> 11:57.799
at the jonesboro coliseum?

11:58.719 --> 11:59.918
- I don't know.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.352
I got a couple of things
penciled in--

12:01.455 --> 12:02.420
- pays $200.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.855
- Great thing about pencils?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.724
They got erasers.
[both laugh]

12:05.809 --> 12:07.125
- I gotta treat
my headliners right.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.093
- Yes, indeed.

12:09.029 --> 12:09.694
I'm gonna need half
the money up front.

12:10.463 --> 12:11.346
- No problem.
Here's my card.

12:11.465 --> 12:13.031
I'll be in touch
with the details.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.603
- He thinks we can see
what he's showing us?

12:18.739 --> 12:20.138
Just smile and wave.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.942
Hey, look at that!
Well, that's great!

12:24.044 --> 12:25.460
- To a night
with no wrestling talk.

12:25.579 --> 12:26.945
- Amen.

12:27.030 --> 12:28.546
[both chuckle]

12:31.118 --> 12:32.717
- have you seen
any good movies lately?

12:32.803 --> 12:34.869
- Oh, randy and I just saw
this movie

12:34.988 --> 12:36.020
called "the highlander."

12:36.106 --> 12:37.539
these guys, called highlanders,

12:37.657 --> 12:39.491
get powers when they kill
other highlanders.

12:39.576 --> 12:40.842
- Uh-huh.
- By the end,

12:40.960 --> 12:42.494
there's this one highlander
who kills off

12:42.629 --> 12:44.979
all the other highlanders
and takes all their powers.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.247
- I do know this movie.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.782
My nephew sam
is actually in it.

12:47.901 --> 12:48.600
- No way.

12:49.436 --> 12:49.934
- Yeah, I think there was
a scene

12:50.036 --> 12:50.969
in madison square garden

12:51.070 --> 12:52.604
where sam wrestles
as the tonga kid.

12:52.706 --> 12:54.506
And I'm talking
about wrestling again.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.307
[both laugh]
- okay,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.643
there has to be consequences
when we do that.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.545
How about
any time we mention it,

13:00.647 --> 13:01.529
we take a drink?

13:01.648 --> 13:03.014
- Mention what?
- Wrestling.

13:03.099 --> 13:04.199
- Drink.
[both laugh]

13:04.317 --> 13:06.317
- okay, it's like that.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.386
- 200 bucks?

13:08.488 --> 13:10.021
That's almost double
what I was getting with lawler.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.956
I get in good
with this jarvis guy,

13:12.092 --> 13:13.091
boy...
[chuckles]

13:15.295 --> 13:16.294
hold on.

13:16.396 --> 13:19.180
Just passed a sign that said,
"population 514."

13:19.299 --> 13:20.999
duck.
- Here?

13:21.084 --> 13:23.151
- Under a 1,000
is a duck town.

13:23.270 --> 13:24.669
They're not friendly
to black people.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.171
- But we can't both duck.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.223
Why don't I drive?
I'm half-samoan.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.457
- Do you think
it'd make a difference

13:29.576 --> 13:30.909
that you're half-samoan?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.127
You think this place
is pro-samoan?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.268
- Ghost car.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.154
- So my friend
was dating a guy

13:43.256 --> 13:45.807
who wanted her to dress up
like george washington.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.158
- Like on the fourth of July?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.394
- Like in the bedroom.
- [laughs]

13:49.496 --> 13:51.162
- powdered wig,
stockings, black shoes

13:51.298 --> 13:52.964
with the big buckle,
the whole thing.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.799
- Imagine if randy came home,

13:54.901 --> 13:56.985
and you were dressed
as sexy george washington.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.087
- He might like it if I played
his ring walk music.

13:59.205 --> 14:00.772
- [laughing]
the graduation song?

14:00.874 --> 14:02.607
- Oh, we're talking
about wrestling again.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.742
[both laugh]
- cheers.

14:04.828 --> 14:06.477
- I'm just gonna leave
the bottle.

14:06.563 --> 14:07.946
[both continue laughing]

14:12.886 --> 14:14.853
- whoa, this place is sold out?

14:14.955 --> 14:16.421
- I told you
it was gonna be big.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.690
Hey, check it out.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.508
This must be what
sylvester stallone feels like

14:20.627 --> 14:21.860
all the time.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.361
- [laughs]

14:23.446 --> 14:25.063
- [chuckles]
there's my headliner.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.465
It's going to be big tonight.
- Hey, mr. Jarvis.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.967
Yeah, I saw that marquee.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.001
- Hey, hold out your hand.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.769
- Uh-oh.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.805
- Bam! I have the money
up front, right?

14:33.890 --> 14:35.106
Deal's a deal.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.808
Come on, let me show you
the green room.

14:38.278 --> 14:40.578
This is
your private dressing room.

14:41.615 --> 14:42.714
- Private?

14:42.816 --> 14:43.781
Nice.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.083
- Got its own bathroom, too.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.118
- A man needs
solitude on the throne.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.853
Rip, elvis presley.
- [chuckles]

14:48.955 --> 14:51.089
we're just gonna cut
a little promo first,

14:51.174 --> 14:52.707
if that's all right?
- Yeah, sure, of course.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.108
- Hey, craig!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.193
I like giving
the audience the feeling

14:55.295 --> 14:56.895
they're getting a sneak peek
behind the scenes.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.313
- I like that.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.998
My wife was working
on a similar idea

15:00.133 --> 15:01.432
out in hawaii
a few years ago.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.184
- So, yeah,
here's what I'm thinking.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.987
You'll be over there...

15:06.106 --> 15:07.188
Eating your chicken
and your watermelon,

15:07.307 --> 15:08.756
and you're pumped
for the match.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.109
You're feeling cocky,
like, you know, talking street

15:11.194 --> 15:13.144
to your opponent--
- hey, stop. Stop.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.329
No.

15:14.447 --> 15:15.780
I won't do
that racist garbage.

15:15.882 --> 15:16.881
- Racist?

15:16.967 --> 15:18.283
This isn't racist.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.385
Other guys got
no problem with it.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.520

15:22.622 --> 15:24.455
to work a gimmick
like that.

15:24.557 --> 15:27.859
And that kind of overt racism

15:27.944 --> 15:29.627
may seem shocking these days,

15:29.729 --> 15:31.663
but there were certain parts
of pro wrestling

15:31.748 --> 15:34.699
back then, in the early '80s,
where that wasn't uncommon.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.034
- Mm, I believe it.

15:36.119 --> 15:38.503
- I was always really proud
of my dad,

15:38.638 --> 15:41.005
because regardless of how badly
he needed that money,

15:41.107 --> 15:42.674
and we needed
that money, man...

15:42.809 --> 15:44.125
He just wouldn't do it.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.778
He'd call that
part of his code.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.364
- Hey, man, I don't care
what other guys do.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.215
Not me.

15:51.351 --> 15:52.533
- It's part of the deal, rocky.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.185
- Not gonna happen.
Come on, dwayne.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.556

how you stayed so calm.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.381
We should have beat his ass.

16:06.416 --> 16:09.434
- Son, there's gonna
always be folks like that.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.002
Always.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.254

It's gonna happen.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.346
Just promise me one thing.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.716
Don't let anyone change
who you are.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.735
You hear me?

16:27.771 --> 16:29.887
You make your own code,
and don't let anyone

16:29.906 --> 16:31.889
force you to break it.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.741
Deal?
- Deal.

16:37.614 --> 16:40.164
Well, I guess we got
a free night now.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.702
Mmm.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.454

16:46.506 --> 16:48.406
- how about we hit
the gym early tomorrow?

16:48.425 --> 16:50.574
Put these carbs to work.
- Well, if we're doing that,

16:50.593 --> 16:51.742
I'm getting some whipped cream.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.294

17:05.058 --> 17:06.290
- I didn't expect
to see you back tonight.

17:06.326 --> 17:07.925

I thought I would come

17:07.961 --> 17:10.461

of that new store energy.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.480

I can't pay you for the time
you've spent helping customers.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.836

for the macho man.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.323
No, this is
an absolute pleasure, yeah.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.742
- To be honest,
it's against company policy

17:24.777 --> 17:25.910
to act as an employee

17:25.945 --> 17:27.378
without attending
the trainee program.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.546
- [sighs]

17:28.581 --> 17:30.114

17:30.150 --> 17:31.682
why don't you take one
of these party cans

17:31.718 --> 17:33.117

Smoked beef snack.

we had a lot of laughs

17:58.745 --> 18:00.144

18:00.163 --> 18:01.446

I can't just leave them.
They need me.

getting what you need, too.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.051

wrestling again.

I'm a huge fan.
The food's on the house.

Why don't you take
that for yourself, then?

No, I--

a thousand stories

your mind back again.

I'll just sit in the corner.

the point of this yearly lunch

20:11.277 --> 20:14.512
is to always be 100% honest
with each other, right?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.664
- Always, yes.

last year, when I told you

I didn't like the smell
of your cologne.
