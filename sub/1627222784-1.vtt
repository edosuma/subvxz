00:25.722 --> 00:26.723
Ah...

00:51.914 --> 00:53.716
Oh...

00:53.750 --> 00:55.051
I need a raise.

00:55.084 --> 00:57.452
Go and bait
the next hunting site.

01:18.841 --> 01:21.376
Yeah!

01:25.380 --> 01:26.783
Not now.

01:26.816 --> 01:29.819
We're movin'. Now.

01:29.852 --> 01:32.054
- But I'm not finished yet.
- Right now!

01:32.088 --> 01:34.589
Let's go!
Come on, we gotta go now.

01:36.424 --> 01:38.895
Up that hill, now!

01:38.928 --> 01:40.997
Pick him up and put him down,
I'm not gonna to ask twice.

01:51.040 --> 01:54.543
<i>Raptor One,
prepare for site one LZ arrival.</i>

01:54.576 --> 01:57.980
Copy that, Blazer One.
Got 12 on board for the hunt. Over.

01:58.014 --> 02:00.515
<i>Roger that, Raptor 1.
Dinner's hot and ready.</i>

02:00.549 --> 02:02.885
<i>Lindon inbound to tag. Over.</i>

02:02.919 --> 02:04.553
I can't breathe in this thing.

02:04.586 --> 02:07.890
- How much further is it?
- We're close.

02:07.924 --> 02:10.860
<i>Copy you,
Blazer 1. Raptor 1 inbound.</i>

02:22.038 --> 02:24.774
Tasers limited to five max.

02:26.709 --> 02:29.779
Alright, looks good.
Let's do it.

02:29.812 --> 02:32.414
<i>All guards report immediately.</i>

02:35.084 --> 02:36.953
- Over there!
- You over there, feet there.

02:36.986 --> 02:38.486
<i>All guards report immediately.</i>

02:38.520 --> 02:40.056
- 4] Now assist the boys.
- Bags off.

02:51.767 --> 02:54.070
This place is a dump!

03:12.889 --> 03:15.590
Welcome to Jurassic Hunt.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.160
Are we ready to have some fun?

03:20.462 --> 03:22.832
Alright, fantastic.

03:22.865 --> 03:24.499
Thank you guys so much

03:24.532 --> 03:26.836
for adhering to my
somewhat lengthy list

03:26.869 --> 03:28.204
of safety precautions.

03:28.237 --> 03:30.672
I know they can be
a bit of a pain, but uh,

03:30.706 --> 03:32.708
we can't be too careful
these days, can we?

03:32.742 --> 03:36.812
While inside the reserve,
security and privacy are essential,

03:36.846 --> 03:41.851
speaking of which,
one final check for prohibited items.

03:41.884 --> 03:43.685
I would say I trust you, but...

03:45.121 --> 03:46.889
Hey, what are you doin'?

03:54.163 --> 03:56.999
Hey, that's my
personal property.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.001
Why would you
bring that here

03:59.035 --> 04:02.004
and cheat the trust
that you and I...?

04:02.038 --> 04:05.741
Listen, guys, the hunting
and non-disclosure agreements

04:05.775 --> 04:09.477
you signed prior to entry,
specifically state,

04:09.511 --> 04:13.182
"No outside cellphones,
communications or recording devices

04:13.215 --> 04:15.751
are allowed inside the reserve.
Period.

04:15.785 --> 04:20.522
Failure to adhere to said agreements
is forfeiture of your payment

04:20.555 --> 04:24.126
and will result in
your immediate expulsion."

04:26.729 --> 04:32.667
Mr. Corrigan, I am truly sorry to disappoint
you and your many, many Twitter followers

04:32.702 --> 04:36.906
the way you have disappointed
me, and us, with this.

04:38.741 --> 04:40.943
Hey! Hey, no, let...

04:44.814 --> 04:47.682
Oh! Oh, my nose!

04:47.717 --> 04:50.987
You broke my nose!
Oh, you're gonna pay for this!

04:51.020 --> 04:54.824
I'm gonna sue you so hard,
you'll be sorry for this.

04:54.857 --> 04:56.691
We're all here
to have a good time,

04:56.726 --> 04:59.195
but it is best
to follow my rules.

04:59.228 --> 05:01.197
Alright, who's ready to hunt?

05:03.232 --> 05:04.834
Pick your poison.

05:04.867 --> 05:07.103
We've got anything
you could possibly want

05:07.136 --> 05:09.671
from <i>Rambo First Blood</i>
to <i>Last Blood.</i>

05:09.705 --> 05:11.907
You crazy kids, go ahead and have at it.
You bought it all.

05:13.641 --> 05:16.544
We had an explosives box
around here somewhere.

05:36.932 --> 05:38.934
I need a tranquilizer gun.

05:40.136 --> 05:41.536
You sure about that?

05:44.206 --> 05:48.944
Guy on the last trip wanted one of those
and, uh, he used it to skin 'em alive.

05:48.978 --> 05:50.545
That's some pretty gnarly stuff.

05:52.081 --> 05:54.050
Is that your brand
of entertainment?

05:56.152 --> 05:57.053
Parker, right?

05:57.953 --> 05:59.255
You have fun.

06:01.257 --> 06:05.227
Alright. Now, if you guys
could please give Mr. Marko

06:05.261 --> 06:06.862
your undivided attention.

06:06.896 --> 06:08.030
Right now, we're standing

06:08.064 --> 06:09.899
at the dead center
of the reserve.

06:09.932 --> 06:11.967
Tomorrow, we'll head south

06:12.001 --> 06:15.337
and hunt various grounds
until we reach camp site two.

06:15.371 --> 06:17.940
We'll stay the night,
hunt the following day

06:17.973 --> 06:22.745
until we reach the exit
and you leave.

06:22.778 --> 06:25.214
We've flown in
the most exciting specimens

06:25.247 --> 06:27.615
from the big park
for your hunting enjoyment.

06:27.649 --> 06:32.955
You are allowed to shoot anything
that was allowed 65 million years ago.

06:32.988 --> 06:34.790
You only keep
what you can carry.

06:34.824 --> 06:36.725
Yeah, and one last thing.

06:38.094 --> 06:39.295
Uh, tracking chip.

06:39.328 --> 06:41.163
I don't remember nothin'
about no tracking chip.

06:41.197 --> 06:44.133
Uh, or you can join
Mr. Corrigan and your hunt ends now.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.768
No refunds.

06:45.801 --> 06:48.971
Listen, guys,
it's just one final precaution,

06:49.004 --> 06:53.209
just in case we have to dig you out
of the forest or the belly of a T-Rex.

06:53.242 --> 06:55.177
Okay.

06:55.211 --> 06:57.913
There you go. Now, I'll know
where to find you.

06:58.881 --> 07:00.349
Ah, it's already up.

07:00.382 --> 07:03.352
You see that? That's you guys.
Neat, right?

07:03.385 --> 07:06.055
Rest assured,
everything is under my control.

07:07.123 --> 07:09.391
Everything is a lot to control.

07:09.425 --> 07:11.760
And that's why
I'm the one controlling it.

07:14.096 --> 07:18.000
I have seen you before.
What is your name?

07:18.968 --> 07:19.835
Valentine.

07:21.003 --> 07:22.738
And you're Blackhawk;

07:22.771 --> 07:26.909
pirate, warlord,
head of a poaching empire.

07:26.942 --> 07:31.679
Wanted by the FBI, CIA, Interpol.
You're famous.

07:33.082 --> 07:34.817
You mean infamous.

07:34.850 --> 07:38.287
Alright, guys.
It is time to eat.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.856
You're gonna love this.
Roasted raptor.

07:40.890 --> 07:43.759
Alright, they're all yours,
Mr. Marko.

07:43.792 --> 07:46.762
Reserve rangers, move out!

08:10.986 --> 08:12.087
If you cannot do it...

08:14.390 --> 08:16.292
I will dig it out for you.

08:16.325 --> 08:18.394
Go play with your little knife
in your tent.

08:18.427 --> 08:21.430
You want to watch me?
I handle it real good, mami.

08:24.833 --> 08:27.436
You lay a hand on me,
and you're gonna regret it.

08:37.046 --> 08:37.980
That's right.

08:38.013 --> 08:40.482
I can spot a killer
a mile away and you...

08:42.217 --> 08:44.386
Maybe you are not one.

08:46.288 --> 08:48.958
Everybody wants to be
the alpha, huh?

08:48.991 --> 08:50.893
Get over yourselves.

08:50.926 --> 08:53.395
The only thing we're
killin' out here is dinosaurs.

09:46.448 --> 09:51.587
I'm sorry. I won't tell anybody.
I swear, I swear.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.155
You hear that, Riggs?
He swears.

09:53.188 --> 09:54.957
It's all good. Stop the car.

09:58.260 --> 10:01.463
The corporation trusted me
with the reserve's privacy,

10:01.497 --> 10:06.068
because it is the single most
essential element in its success.

10:06.101 --> 10:08.203
Tell me you understand that.

10:08.237 --> 10:09.238
Well, yeah, but the thing is...

10:09.271 --> 10:11.173
Good!
Back to the hunt you go!

10:13.542 --> 10:15.077
Hey, wait, what are you doin'?

10:15.110 --> 10:17.212
You get the VIP experience.

10:17.246 --> 10:20.182
No, wait! Hey!

10:20.215 --> 10:21.317
Happy huntin'.

10:25.654 --> 10:28.924
Hey! Come back!

10:28.957 --> 10:32.494
Hey! Hey, you red bastards!
Don't you leave me!

10:34.129 --> 10:37.299
Oh, come on, Corrigan, think.

10:59.355 --> 11:03.192
<i>Marko, come here, please.</i>

11:07.129 --> 11:09.365
Rabbit, where are you?

11:09.398 --> 11:12.668
<i>Marko, come here, please.</i>

11:12.702 --> 11:17.906
Rabbit. Rabbit, where are you?

11:17.940 --> 11:20.509
<i>Let's run away.
There are too many of them.</i>

11:20.542 --> 11:22.911
<i>They're too fast. Marko!</i>

11:22.945 --> 11:26.148
If I have to come find your ass,
I'm killin' it.

12:16.632 --> 12:19.401
I thought you boys hunt that...

12:32.214 --> 12:33.949
Get ready.

13:30.172 --> 13:31.273
Rocket launcher.

14:00.435 --> 14:02.204
Get up, Parker!

14:21.290 --> 14:23.125
Well...

14:23.158 --> 14:25.127
That's five down, gentlemen.

14:25.160 --> 14:26.295
Six to go.

14:29.732 --> 14:31.600
I don't plan on dying.

14:31.633 --> 14:34.269
I also do not plan on dying.

14:34.303 --> 14:35.671
Any sign of Marko?

14:35.705 --> 14:37.172
I found this.

14:43.645 --> 14:46.448
Alright, it's your kill.

14:48.216 --> 14:49.618
Finish it.

14:53.155 --> 14:55.624
- It's time to choose.
- Do it.

14:56.759 --> 14:59.528
It's waking up.
Kill it already.

14:59.561 --> 15:01.263
I'll do it.

15:01.296 --> 15:02.698
Back off.

15:02.732 --> 15:04.566
Damn it, Valentine!

15:04.600 --> 15:06.234
What?

15:06.268 --> 15:08.470
Somebody had to put it
out of its misery, right?

15:08.503 --> 15:09.706
Now, it's done.

15:10.707 --> 15:12.809
Alright, what's next?

15:15.410 --> 15:19.581
Hello, is anyone there?
Can anyone hear me?

15:19.615 --> 15:21.416
Over.

15:21.450 --> 15:24.219
Well, fellas,
looks like we're on our own.

15:51.313 --> 15:55.651
Now, see,
this is the opposite of good.

15:56.385 --> 15:57.452
Sir.

15:59.956 --> 16:02.257
Come on, breed already.

16:03.625 --> 16:06.261
Listen, my clock is ticking.

16:06.294 --> 16:09.598
If these two don't start spilling
baby batter in next two hours,

16:09.631 --> 16:12.200
put them in the blender
for next week's guests.

16:12.234 --> 16:14.503
<i>Comprende?</i> Fantastic.

16:17.874 --> 16:20.810
Sir, should I extract
the hunters?

16:20.843 --> 16:24.546
Extraction. Not yet.

16:24.579 --> 16:26.983
Get me everything you can
on this Parker woman.

16:27.016 --> 16:28.450
Sir.

16:31.854 --> 16:33.890
I don't care for you very much.

16:41.798 --> 16:43.398
I always wanted
one of these AKs, man.

16:43.432 --> 16:44.734
- Hey.
- Where'd you get that?

16:44.767 --> 16:46.635
Mother Russia.

16:46.668 --> 16:48.771
What do you
think you are doing?

16:48.805 --> 16:51.373
It's been hours.

16:51.406 --> 16:54.376
Nobody's coming for us,
and I'm not staying here.

16:54.409 --> 16:55.945
And I paid to hunt.

16:57.780 --> 16:58.748
You sure you know
where you're going?

16:58.781 --> 17:03.518
Marko said if we trek south,
we'd reach the exit.

17:03.552 --> 17:05.855
Oh, wait, wait.
You can be reasonable, boys.

17:05.887 --> 17:08.825
It is a big mistake, but we stay
here, they know where to find us.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.026
I-I just think maybe not...

17:10.059 --> 17:13.762
I don't care what you
or anyone else thinks.

17:13.796 --> 17:15.297
Stay if you want.

17:15.329 --> 17:17.332
You've seen what
those dinosaurs can do.

17:17.365 --> 17:21.738
Hey... they hunted us,
so we'll hunt them on our way out.

17:21.771 --> 17:23.005
Yes.

17:24.073 --> 17:25.742
Better to stick together.

17:25.775 --> 17:27.743
I didn't catch where you
said you were from, again.

17:27.777 --> 17:29.812
- I didn't say.
- Take this.

17:31.413 --> 17:34.717
Hey, kid, you're gonna need

17:34.751 --> 17:36.651
more than a tranquilizer gun
and a knife

17:36.685 --> 17:39.554
if you intend to survive
in a Jurassic game hunt.

17:39.588 --> 17:43.692
I have exactly what I need and
I'm gettin' out of here fast.

17:46.929 --> 17:49.331
Well, Valentino,
let's go hunting, man.

17:49.364 --> 17:50.532
Let's go.

18:14.757 --> 18:16.691
You ain't used to
this sort of thing, are you?

18:17.692 --> 18:19.729
I have hunt duck.

18:19.762 --> 18:22.732
Duck? What the hell
are you doin' out here, man?

18:23.900 --> 18:27.502
Honestly, I'm not too sure.

18:27.536 --> 18:29.538
Yeah, well, I'll let you
in on a little secret.

18:29.571 --> 18:33.709
These guys? I've been on more
hunts than any of them combined.

18:34.576 --> 18:35.644
Trust me on this.

18:37.747 --> 18:40.016
If you wanna kill some
dinosaurs, you stick with me.

18:42.785 --> 18:44.486
What is this?

18:44.519 --> 18:46.388
- What the hell is that, man?
- What is that?

18:47.656 --> 18:48.758
It burns!

18:49.926 --> 18:51.093
Do not touch it!

18:52.094 --> 18:53.996
Help me. Get it off!

18:54.030 --> 18:54.964
Get it off me!

18:54.997 --> 18:58.333
No, no. Help me, help me!

19:06.742 --> 19:07.743
Hold still!

19:07.777 --> 19:08.845
Help me.

19:13.883 --> 19:15.450
Get down!

19:37.572 --> 19:39.876
Are you alright?

19:45.848 --> 19:47.917
What the hell was that?

19:47.950 --> 19:49.417
A grenade, of course.

19:49.451 --> 19:50.853
You could have killed us all!

19:50.887 --> 19:54.790
You whine like a mule,
yet you are still alive.

19:54.824 --> 19:58.460
- Don't you ever...
- This is my hunt.

19:58.493 --> 20:03.199
You are not in charge.
You do not give me orders.

20:03.232 --> 20:05.735
If you think you
have the power here,

20:05.768 --> 20:07.970
you came to
the wrong place, woman.

20:09.238 --> 20:11.573
Still hurt?

20:11.606 --> 20:13.776
No, no, screw it, man.
I don't need it.

20:22.118 --> 20:26.188
Yes, this is my forest now!

20:26.222 --> 20:27.656
Let's move.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.461
Well, welcome to campsite one.

21:18.606 --> 21:21.476
Well, boys,
we're eatin' better tonight.

21:23.112 --> 21:26.816
The roasted raptor yesterday
tasted 200 million years old.

21:26.849 --> 21:28.818
The world could always
use another vegan.

21:28.851 --> 21:32.121
Sweet Jesus.
Are you a vegetarian, too?

21:32.154 --> 21:35.958
How does a vegetarian survive
in a dog-eat-dog world?

21:35.992 --> 21:40.562
It is now a
dinosaur-eat-dinosaur world, huh?

21:40.595 --> 21:42.932
Yeah, no, that does not
have the same ring to it.

21:48.104 --> 21:51.007
Ah, yes.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.542
This is what
I am talking about. This.

21:57.179 --> 21:58.646
<i>Permiso, senorita.</i>

22:01.717 --> 22:07.589
Hey, Parker, are you going to do
some actual hunting here?

22:07.622 --> 22:09.892
I think I've seen enough carnage
for one day.

22:28.944 --> 22:30.813
- Hey, Sergei.
- Hm?

22:31.881 --> 22:34.682
- Ask you a question, man?
- Yeah.

22:34.717 --> 22:37.153
When you're out there
on the plains,

22:37.186 --> 22:39.955
and you see
one of them dinosaurs,

22:39.989 --> 22:44.160
you ever feel like doin' somethin',
you know, other than killin' them?

22:45.693 --> 22:47.229
Like a little more, you know?

22:47.263 --> 22:49.631
You ever...
when you see 'em you know, get...

22:49.664 --> 22:51.133
Get those like urges to...

22:51.167 --> 22:54.036
Like a crocodile hunter.
Wrestle.

22:56.105 --> 22:58.107
Yeah.
Yeah, kind of like that, man.

22:58.140 --> 22:59.942
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Nyet.

22:59.975 --> 23:02.945
Yeah, no. No, me either, man.
That's weird.

23:04.380 --> 23:05.881
Let's go hunt 'em.

23:05.915 --> 23:07.883
Yeah, let's go hunt 'em.

23:10.853 --> 23:14.790
Yeah, keep laughin'.
Assholes.

23:36.145 --> 23:40.783
I want a brontosaurus.
Massive!

23:40.816 --> 23:44.220
Then I've killed
the biggest thing on Earth.

23:44.253 --> 23:49.859
Well, the second
biggest thing on Earth.

23:49.892 --> 23:52.027
Bullock, what trophy
are you here for?

23:55.965 --> 23:57.632
I will drink to that.

24:01.103 --> 24:03.272
Those are US dog tags.

24:04.206 --> 24:05.107
Yes.

24:12.114 --> 24:14.150
The communist
has a taste of it now.

24:14.183 --> 24:18.120
It's a thrill to kill.
That's how it starts.

24:18.154 --> 24:20.756
Only once
you have killed something...

24:20.789 --> 24:23.926
...can you find out what you are.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.896
Only then can you
fully appreciate life.

24:26.929 --> 24:29.431
This guy's insane, man.

24:29.465 --> 24:31.333
He's got the touch.

24:31.367 --> 24:34.436
Work as hard
and maybe, just maybe,

24:34.470 --> 24:37.173
you will be as good as I am.

24:37.206 --> 24:40.442
Does being good include
throwing grenades at your prey?

24:41.877 --> 24:45.881
If it works, it works.

24:45.915 --> 24:48.417
Do you know
how I got my name, hmm?

24:49.318 --> 24:52.021
Shall I tell them, hmm?

24:53.422 --> 24:56.792
I took down
a Blackhawk helicopter

24:56.825 --> 25:01.730
filled with US soldiers
with one grenade.

25:01.764 --> 25:03.966
And that make you proud?

25:03.999 --> 25:09.872
Those soldiers come to my home
to stop my people

25:09.905 --> 25:13.142
from hunting animals
on our lands.

25:13.175 --> 25:17.112
Endangered animals
whose parts you sold

25:17.146 --> 25:22.017
to fund a civil war that killed tens
of thousands of innocent people!

25:22.051 --> 25:28.390
You may think you know me,
but you know nothing of my people!

25:28.424 --> 25:33.929
Now, I did not start the fight
with your soldiers, but I ended it.

25:34.463 --> 25:36.365
They died a warrior's death.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.269
That's the most a soldier
can hope for.

25:40.302 --> 25:42.104
You cannot be serious.

25:42.137 --> 25:45.107
Throwing grenades
does not make you a badass.

25:46.208 --> 25:48.477
It make you a coward.

25:48.510 --> 25:52.815
Warrior, solider,
poacher, bastard.

25:52.848 --> 25:55.317
Names do not matter.

25:56.318 --> 25:58.854
You know what matters most, hmm?

26:00.055 --> 26:02.524
I am the one
that is still alive!

26:03.859 --> 26:07.263
I am the one
that is still standing!

26:07.296 --> 26:10.032
Who needs to prove themselves
when you have this?

26:13.302 --> 26:17.506
Ah, yes. That is power.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.378
I have the power!

26:24.013 --> 26:28.384
Blackhawk comes out on top.
Blackhawk never...

26:33.956 --> 26:35.457
Take it off!

26:42.398 --> 26:44.099
Everyone down!

26:51.106 --> 26:56.412
Blackhawk down, motherfucker!

27:01.550 --> 27:03.419
You think we're
stickin' around after that?

27:03.452 --> 27:05.154
Hell with the group, man.

27:05.187 --> 27:07.356
Too many people,
too many targets.

27:07.389 --> 27:09.224
That's why we're creepin' out of here.
Right, Sergei?

27:09.258 --> 27:11.093
It's nothing personal.

27:11.126 --> 27:14.363
See y'all at the exit.
If you make it. Good luck.

27:20.035 --> 27:23.005
Every man for themselves. Right?

27:50.632 --> 27:52.434
You're gonna wanna read this.

27:52.468 --> 27:53.602
Now.

27:57.639 --> 28:01.577
Now, see, that is
the shit I don't like.

28:01.610 --> 28:02.911
Shall I handle it?

28:02.945 --> 28:05.547
While I do appreciate
your fervor,

28:05.581 --> 28:10.486
uh, let's not risk any valuable
personnel by going out there.

28:12.454 --> 28:14.957
<i>Lindon, please.</i>

28:18.026 --> 28:19.194
Rabbit, buddy.

28:19.228 --> 28:21.029
I need an extraction.

28:22.064 --> 28:23.198
I'm so tired of running.

28:23.232 --> 28:25.033
It's gonna be alright, buddy,

28:25.067 --> 28:26.969
we're comin' to get you.
But, hey, listen,

28:27.002 --> 28:28.971
<i>there's something
I need you to do first.</i>

28:29.004 --> 28:31.473
There's a hunter named "Parker."

28:31.507 --> 28:35.144
She cannot leave
this reserve alive.

28:35.177 --> 28:38.313
Can I ask you to take an active
role in the imposition...

28:38.347 --> 28:40.549
No! I can't do it.

28:40.582 --> 28:43.018
<i>Please, just come and get me.</i>

28:43.051 --> 28:47.322
I will triple your salary.

28:52.327 --> 28:53.962
<i>How much we talking about?</i>

28:59.034 --> 29:00.436
We made the right decision, man.

29:00.469 --> 29:03.005
Them fools are gonna get
their asses killed.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.209
But like I said, man, stick with me...

29:07.242 --> 29:08.510
Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

29:08.544 --> 29:10.179
And we'll be out just...
What, man?

29:16.051 --> 29:18.620
Yeah. Shoot it.

29:18.654 --> 29:21.123
- What?
- Yeah, man, come on.

29:21.156 --> 29:22.524
That's what we're here for.
Shoot it.

29:22.558 --> 29:24.426
It's-it's peaceful creature.

29:24.460 --> 29:26.528
Kind of. Hey, I'll do it.

29:29.264 --> 29:31.099
AK, man.

29:32.468 --> 29:33.635
What's up? What's up?

29:36.739 --> 29:39.174
Here we go. Headshot.

29:41.210 --> 29:43.045
Oh, damn, he moved.

29:43.078 --> 29:46.014
Oh, yeah. Alright, alright.
I got this, alright, go.

29:47.182 --> 29:48.684
Damn, man.

29:52.287 --> 29:54.757
Whoa, man! You hit that thing
with a shotgun.

29:54.791 --> 29:57.125
- Hmm.
- That's badass.

30:00.062 --> 30:01.764
Do-do you hear that?

30:03.532 --> 30:05.334
Nah, man, I ain't hear nothin'.

30:08.337 --> 30:10.105
Get it off!

30:15.712 --> 30:17.412
No, please, no!

30:27.322 --> 30:28.725
I gotta get out of here.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.803
Jesus.

31:18.808 --> 31:21.577
Ooh. Hi.

31:21.610 --> 31:23.545
Too much for you, <i>mi amor?</i>

31:23.579 --> 31:27.382
Huh, this little adventure
not going the way you expected?

31:27.416 --> 31:30.218
It's going exactly
as I expected!

31:34.857 --> 31:36.124
Fine.

31:41.663 --> 31:43.766
Oops.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.601
You don't wanna do this.

31:45.634 --> 31:47.135
Yes, I do.

31:55.510 --> 31:59.615
Drop the knives.

31:59.648 --> 32:03.452
Valentino, just let us have
a little bit of fun here, eh?

32:03.485 --> 32:07.623
We all paid to kill dinosaurs,
not people.

32:07.656 --> 32:10.927
That's pretty stupid logic if
you're going to, uh, shoot us.

32:10.960 --> 32:14.864
No... just you.

32:26.876 --> 32:28.143
Okay.

32:36.218 --> 32:38.487
I had it handled.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.355
That's a funny way
of saying "thank you."

32:40.389 --> 32:43.258
Once again,
I don't need your help.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.895
You need to take a hint, Parker.

32:45.928 --> 32:48.765
It is time for you
to hold a real weapon.

32:48.798 --> 32:50.599
- I don't...
- Shut up.

32:52.701 --> 32:54.269
Parker, people are dying.

32:54.302 --> 32:55.972
Our numbers are dwindling.

32:56.005 --> 32:58.373
Did you see Torres?

32:58.407 --> 33:02.377
He's gonna scalp me alive
the second he has a chance.

33:02.411 --> 33:05.547
I need you to have my back.

33:29.839 --> 33:31.440
Hold it!

33:31.473 --> 33:35.277
- What the hell?
- Please! I heard voices.

33:35.310 --> 33:39.015
Oh, my God.
I am so glad I found people.

33:39.048 --> 33:41.249
I've been out there
for so long.

33:41.283 --> 33:42.785
Who are you?

33:42.819 --> 33:44.386
I'm with the hunting group.

33:44.419 --> 33:46.923
I'm the only one left.

33:46.956 --> 33:50.325
Those things, man,
they're everywhere.

33:52.461 --> 33:53.796
Are you with the reserve?

33:53.830 --> 33:55.865
Do we look like
we're with the reserve?

33:55.898 --> 33:58.000
How long have you
been out there?

33:59.434 --> 34:01.536
I don't know.

34:01.570 --> 34:04.539
I'm Rabbit, by the way.
You guys have names?

34:04.573 --> 34:06.776
I'm Valentine.

34:06.809 --> 34:11.612
That's Parker, Bullock.
This is Torres.

34:15.484 --> 34:17.585
- Parker...
- Hey!

34:17.619 --> 34:19.254
You don't look like no hunter.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.456
I'm not.

34:21.489 --> 34:22.792
I'm actually an accountant.

34:23.726 --> 34:24.994
Yeah.

34:25.027 --> 34:28.463
I thought I could handle this,
but I was so wrong.

34:28.496 --> 34:30.599
What's in the bag?

34:30.632 --> 34:32.501
The bag?

34:32.534 --> 34:34.871
I found somethin'
really strange out there.

34:34.904 --> 34:36.706
You wanna see it?

34:47.616 --> 34:50.018
What the hell is this?

34:50.052 --> 34:53.054
I think it's some
type of synthetic compound.

34:53.089 --> 34:55.824
That's a mighty big assumption
for an accountant.

34:55.858 --> 34:57.425
May I?

35:01.998 --> 35:03.032
I think it's...

35:05.968 --> 35:06.936
What... Get...

35:06.969 --> 35:09.772
What the hell just happened?

35:09.806 --> 35:11.473
- Are you okay?
- Do you smell that?

35:21.818 --> 35:23.052
Let's go, let's go!

35:23.786 --> 35:25.620
Run, go!

36:13.970 --> 36:15.171
<i>It has begun.</i>

36:15.204 --> 36:17.006
They're dropping
like flies, sir.

36:17.039 --> 36:19.742
<i>I said take...</i>

36:19.775 --> 36:21.676
- Oh.
- <i>What are you, a woman? Huh?</i>

36:21.711 --> 36:24.947
- <i>Jesus freak.</i>
- <i>I'm lactose intolerant, man.</i>

36:24.981 --> 36:26.115
Perfection.

36:26.148 --> 36:29.684
<i>Lactose intolerant!</i>

36:29.719 --> 36:32.654
<i>You think...</i>

36:32.687 --> 36:34.891
<i>Dumbass!</i>

36:34.924 --> 36:37.159
Oh. Okay.

36:41.663 --> 36:43.032
What's that smell?

36:43.065 --> 36:46.468
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.

36:47.535 --> 36:49.504
You gotta get rid of the jacket.
Ditch it now, go.

36:49.537 --> 36:51.707
- Go. Now!
- What is it?

36:51.741 --> 36:53.508
Dino hormones. Has to be.

36:53.541 --> 36:54.877
Hunters use that sometimes
to attract prey.

36:54.911 --> 36:57.146
Look, anything
that got spray on it,

36:57.179 --> 36:58.647
you gotta get rid of it,
alright?

37:01.083 --> 37:03.185
So who was that
<i>yo puta</i> guy, hey?

37:03.219 --> 37:04.987
He has to work for Lindon.

37:05.021 --> 37:06.789
Wait, so Lindon's
trying to kill us?

37:06.822 --> 37:10.760
The Jurassic hunters
have become the Jurassic hunted.

37:10.793 --> 37:11.827
This place is insane.

37:11.861 --> 37:13.628
Lindon is crazy.

37:13.662 --> 37:15.131
He's out of control.

37:15.164 --> 37:18.633
This doesn't end
until we're all dead

37:18.667 --> 37:20.535
or until he thinks
we're all dead.

37:28.244 --> 37:29.946
We have to get off the grid.

37:29.979 --> 37:32.982
For once,
we're on the same page.

37:34.817 --> 37:35.952
Who's first?

37:37.253 --> 37:39.155
I'll do it.

37:39.188 --> 37:40.990
- No.
- It'll work.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.661
Do you know what you're doing?

37:52.969 --> 37:54.737
Let me see. Alright.

38:03.145 --> 38:05.613
All the, uh,
chip signals are dead.

38:06.681 --> 38:08.250
Rabbit must have done his job.

38:11.653 --> 38:13.789
What are you lookin' for?

38:13.823 --> 38:16.524
Riggsy, do you know
why I'm in charge?

38:17.559 --> 38:19.095
Nepotism?

38:19.128 --> 38:24.066
It's because I am thorough,
and I leave nothing to chance.

38:24.100 --> 38:28.971
My tasks are completed to a level of
perfection rarely achieved by others,

38:29.005 --> 38:33.743
with no loose ends
and no collusion.

38:33.776 --> 38:36.779
Something to remember
if you ever want to be a big dog

38:36.812 --> 38:38.546
in the corporate machine.

38:39.081 --> 38:40.182
Ah.

38:44.686 --> 38:45.855
Shit.

38:47.923 --> 38:49.291
Do you want me
to send the team in?

38:49.325 --> 38:52.061
No collusion.

38:52.094 --> 38:55.998
We are not murderers, Riggs,
we are moderators at best.

38:56.032 --> 38:59.735
We allow nature
to sort herself out naturally.

38:59.769 --> 39:05.941
That said, we can make their
chances of survival difficult.

39:05.975 --> 39:08.010
How many more
provision drops are there?

39:08.044 --> 39:11.180
- Three, sir.
- Yeah, let's make sure those are canceled

39:11.213 --> 39:14.717
and all loose caches
are removed.

39:14.750 --> 39:21.123
No food, plus no weapons,
equals no hunters.

39:21.157 --> 39:23.826
- Easy.
- Yes, sir. I'm on it.

39:29.732 --> 39:31.633
My little piggies.

39:37.807 --> 39:39.241
My man, Rambo.

39:39.275 --> 39:44.713
We need to be silent, no?
This silent.

39:46.382 --> 39:50.052
There's something about hunting
dinosaur with bow and arrow.

39:50.086 --> 39:51.887
It just seem right, you know?

39:51.921 --> 39:52.855
Does it?

39:54.223 --> 39:56.292
So campsite two?

39:56.325 --> 39:58.861
Yeah, we'll have
more supplies there.

39:58.894 --> 40:01.097
That's just where Lindon
wants us to go.

40:02.164 --> 40:03.766
So? We kill him.

40:03.799 --> 40:05.835
And anything else
that try to stop us.

40:05.868 --> 40:07.903
He'll be waiting for us there.

40:07.937 --> 40:10.773
We have to use
the element of surprise.

40:10.806 --> 40:12.108
So what then?

40:13.042 --> 40:14.743
You're a hunter, right?

40:15.878 --> 40:17.880
Let's hunt.

40:17.913 --> 40:20.249
You mean for that little guy
that sprayed you?

40:20.282 --> 40:22.985
Wherever he's goin',
probably be safe.

40:23.018 --> 40:25.788
Ooh, I am going to love gutting
that little <i>pendejo.</i>

40:25.821 --> 40:30.126
We gotta keep him alive
to get to Lindon.

40:30.159 --> 40:33.028
Without him we have no leverage,
no nothing.

40:33.062 --> 40:35.931
Don't jeopardize our only lead.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.442
Wait. You hear that?

40:46.475 --> 40:47.843
Yeah.

40:51.180 --> 40:55.818
Good, good, good.
But let's try this, alright?

40:55.851 --> 41:00.990
Let's slide this down
nice and easy like this.

41:01.023 --> 41:05.828
And there we should be able
to watch all our little friends.

41:07.863 --> 41:12.201
Alright, let's get it over here
and take a little peek.

41:14.203 --> 41:16.038
You like to watch, don't you?

41:17.439 --> 41:19.041
Yeah, you do.

41:22.278 --> 41:27.883
And we should see one, two...

41:29.919 --> 41:32.254
Three should be right over...

41:45.100 --> 41:46.869
Rambo, baby.

41:46.902 --> 41:49.104
Yeah, not too bad.

41:49.138 --> 41:51.440
Now, do you think
you can find Rabbit?

41:51.473 --> 41:53.742
Does a dinosaur
shit in the woods?

41:54.476 --> 41:55.878
He went that way.

42:06.522 --> 42:08.157
Ooh!

42:14.163 --> 42:16.966
Hey, you even know
where you're goin'?

42:19.368 --> 42:21.971
He's fast, but messy.

42:29.945 --> 42:30.946
Stay here.

42:33.249 --> 42:34.984
Can we trust him?

42:36.552 --> 42:40.122
I don't know.
I hope so.

42:41.857 --> 42:43.459
I told you
he would skin me alive

42:43.492 --> 42:46.195
if it meant his own survival.

42:46.228 --> 42:48.030
That's probably still the case.

42:54.103 --> 42:56.005
Been trackin' us for a while.

42:57.106 --> 42:59.441
You used us as bait?

42:59.475 --> 43:01.577
Torres, teamwork.

43:01.610 --> 43:03.946
Hey, I just saved
your lives, okay?!

43:06.248 --> 43:07.916
You can have
the next one if you like.

43:11.420 --> 43:14.323
Can I borrow your knife
a second?

43:18.294 --> 43:19.361
Gracias.

43:35.077 --> 43:36.278
You want one?

43:36.312 --> 43:39.014
Alright, hurry up,
we're wasting time.

43:39.048 --> 43:41.016
Alright,
he's getting further away.

43:41.050 --> 43:43.118
Come on. Get what you need,
and let's go.

43:48.157 --> 43:49.224
Gracias.

43:50.559 --> 43:52.061
You're so nice.

44:31.467 --> 44:32.634
He's here.

44:35.170 --> 44:36.438
Down there.

45:21.617 --> 45:23.318
Let me go, let me go!

45:23.352 --> 45:26.422
If I do that, Torres here
is gonna open your throat.

45:29.591 --> 45:32.094
What-what do you
want me to do?

45:34.062 --> 45:35.464
Make a call.

45:35.497 --> 45:38.333
We don't have two days.

45:38.367 --> 45:41.203
I need a new drone now.

45:41.236 --> 45:43.105
So get Jeff on the phone

45:43.138 --> 45:46.675
and tell him to use that
fancy prototype delivery drone

45:46.709 --> 45:49.678
to bring us a new drone now.

45:50.579 --> 45:52.247
Rabbit, for you.

45:55.517 --> 45:56.618
Go.

45:56.652 --> 45:58.287
You're gonna wanna take this.

46:10.199 --> 46:11.266
Talk to me.

46:11.300 --> 46:13.202
It's done.

46:15.204 --> 46:16.605
Elaborate.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.008
They are...

46:21.343 --> 46:24.480
<i>Dead. They're dead, all of 'em.</i>

46:30.586 --> 46:32.488
Are you sure?

46:32.521 --> 46:35.624
<i>After they shot down the
drone, I scented them</i>

46:35.657 --> 46:37.292
and then the raptors got 'em.

46:37.326 --> 46:39.695
I saw it with my own two eyes.

46:46.435 --> 46:47.737
Congratulations.

46:47.770 --> 46:51.673
You've become a very,
very rich man.

46:55.812 --> 46:59.248
Campsite two, high noon.

47:00.315 --> 47:01.650
I'll bring my checkbook.

47:08.557 --> 47:10.425
<i>We don't need him anymore.</i>

47:11.326 --> 47:14.363
He's dead weight.

47:14.396 --> 47:16.799
- He's still useful to us.
- It's a mistake!

47:19.401 --> 47:24.673
We made a deal with him.
We're keepin' him alive.

47:24.707 --> 47:27.309
Look, the map says campsite two
isn't far from here.

47:27.342 --> 47:29.278
I say we
camp here for the night.

47:29.311 --> 47:34.149
Yeah, it's safe enough for him,
it'll be safe enough for us.

47:34.182 --> 47:36.151
At least, let me check my traps.

47:38.387 --> 47:41.223
Obviously,
we didn't trip any coming in.

47:42.725 --> 47:44.593
They need to be checked.

47:47.162 --> 47:49.766
Look, I don't wanna
die here either,

47:49.799 --> 47:51.700
and you don't know
where they all are.

47:59.675 --> 48:00.810
Show me.

48:13.923 --> 48:19.127
Uh... I got bad news.

48:19.161 --> 48:22.497
We're gonna have to put this out
otherwise they might see it.

48:24.433 --> 48:27.536
Well, then I think you ought to
give me your scarf, pretty boy.

48:43.820 --> 48:46.588
Good, it's done.

48:46.622 --> 48:48.156
That's the last one.

48:48.190 --> 48:49.358
Okay, <i>vamonos.</i>

48:50.258 --> 48:52.160
Come on, <i>pendejo!</i>

48:52.194 --> 48:53.863
Alright.

48:53.896 --> 48:55.163
Come on!

49:07.342 --> 49:09.177
Try that again.

49:09.211 --> 49:13.649
<i>Por favor,</i>
try to escape one more time,

49:13.682 --> 49:19.454
so I can accidentally bash your skull
nine times on one of these rocks, hey?

49:21.791 --> 49:23.525
Your time will come.

49:24.693 --> 49:26.328
Now, get your ass up.

49:33.568 --> 49:36.906
You going to show the world
this part of your hunting video?

49:39.608 --> 49:41.911
Where you tie up a man
and hold him against his will?

49:47.984 --> 49:50.853
The world needs to see
what's goin' on here.

49:50.887 --> 49:53.188
I haven't killed anybody.

49:54.589 --> 49:55.858
Not yet.

50:15.778 --> 50:18.447
Just make sure
that gets to its proper home.

50:19.749 --> 50:21.851
It does not deserve
to stay here.

50:21.884 --> 50:24.653
Strangely nice of you.

50:24.686 --> 50:28.490
I always kept a souvenir
from every person I kill.

50:28.523 --> 50:31.660
But maybe it's time
for a change.

50:32.494 --> 50:34.897
Just out of curiosity,

50:34.931 --> 50:38.000
how many people
have you murdered?

50:42.237 --> 50:46.976
There was a-a sniper
in Afghanistan...

50:48.643 --> 50:52.915
and he was pickin' off
US troops, like for weeks.

50:54.917 --> 51:00.022
So they brought me in
to hunt the monster.

51:02.792 --> 51:03.893
Sniper.

51:11.100 --> 51:14.771
So I'm laying on
my belly for days,

51:14.804 --> 51:19.374
and I'm scouting every nook and
cranny, every shadow.

51:19.407 --> 51:22.677
I cannot see him.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.914
But I know he's there
and I know...

51:24.947 --> 51:28.951
I know that he's
doin' the same thing.

51:29.684 --> 51:31.286
He's hunting me.

51:33.555 --> 51:39.494
Five-hundred yards in the unforgiving
terrain and crosswinds everywhere.

51:47.669 --> 51:48.805
Got him.

51:51.808 --> 51:56.012
The reflection... in the scope.

51:58.647 --> 52:00.116
Right in his eye.

52:00.149 --> 52:03.685
There is nothing like
killing another human being.

52:06.956 --> 52:08.423
But when they die...

52:09.759 --> 52:13.595
you know,
a little piece of you dies, too.

52:24.439 --> 52:28.711
Well, thank you
for your service.

52:30.046 --> 52:32.514
Okay. But what about you, eh?

52:32.547 --> 52:34.349
Yeah, I can tell you served.

52:35.017 --> 52:37.019
Yep.

52:42.624 --> 52:45.427
Maria, <i>mira puesso.</i>

52:47.096 --> 52:49.098
So development group.

52:50.800 --> 52:55.738
SEAL Team Six.
Soldier for life!

52:56.973 --> 52:58.708
You know...

52:58.741 --> 53:04.013
which was always
assumed to be a short life.

53:05.680 --> 53:10.385
All I ever wanted
was to die a warrior's death.

53:11.954 --> 53:15.992
You both place
such a low value on life.

53:22.464 --> 53:25.968
If you had to
blow Lindon's brains out

53:26.002 --> 53:27.702
to escape this place...

53:30.706 --> 53:32.174
could you do it?

53:45.755 --> 53:47.857
You're a real psycho,
you know that?

53:51.693 --> 53:52.929
Maybe I am.

55:12.274 --> 55:15.044
Where's the...? Where's the...?

55:35.064 --> 55:36.032
Watch, Valentino.

55:36.065 --> 55:37.733
Where are you going?

55:37.767 --> 55:38.868
Hunting.

55:39.701 --> 55:40.936
Adios, <i>mi amor.</i>

56:11.100 --> 56:15.004
You're dead!
You hear me? Dead!

56:15.037 --> 56:17.206
Hey, hey, come on.

56:17.239 --> 56:22.244
Hey, listen,
I still need you okay?

56:22.278 --> 56:26.115
There's still a mission for you
to complete, soldier, understand?

56:33.055 --> 56:34.890
Where's the bottle?
Give me the bottle.

56:44.433 --> 56:45.868
Shit.

56:48.104 --> 56:49.939
Thank you for saving me
back there.

56:52.108 --> 56:53.843
Oh, feeling's mutual.

56:56.278 --> 56:58.247
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

57:44.160 --> 57:46.929
Oh, you want to play, hey?

57:46.962 --> 57:49.365
Okay, come on,
let's do this. Eh?

57:54.970 --> 57:56.172
Ahh!

58:03.479 --> 58:06.248
Hey, come on.

58:08.317 --> 58:10.152
Hey. Hey.

58:13.055 --> 58:14.857
Come on, baby.

58:41.050 --> 58:42.151
I have to tell you something.

58:42.184 --> 58:46.789
Lindon isn't trying to kill us,
he's trying to kill me.

58:46.822 --> 58:49.491
These glasses are recording
everything in here.

58:49.525 --> 58:51.493
So you are a spy.

58:51.527 --> 58:55.831
I'm with an agency that's trying to
expose this place and its cruelty.

58:55.864 --> 58:58.000
I've got to get this footage
out of here.

58:58.033 --> 59:00.035
What if Rabbit's alive?

59:00.069 --> 59:01.870
If he is alive,

59:01.904 --> 59:07.176
I seriously doubt he would
contact Lindon after he got free

59:07.209 --> 59:10.546
and tell him that he lied,
and that we're still alive.

59:13.315 --> 59:16.018
Hey, Valentine, campsite two!

59:16.051 --> 59:18.420
We're here. Hey, buddy. Hey.

59:22.024 --> 59:23.058
Keep movin'.

59:31.133 --> 59:33.335
Enjoying the hunt, Miss Parker?

59:38.274 --> 59:39.975
You son of a...

59:42.144 --> 59:46.415
Ouch! That looked painful
and completely unnecessary.

59:46.448 --> 59:48.317
Riggs, you bad boy.

59:48.350 --> 59:52.021
Didn't your father ever teach
you never to strike a woman,

59:52.054 --> 59:55.557
but if you do, you beat her to the
body, so the bruises won't show?

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.966
Oh, Rabbit, buddy!

01:00:03.999 --> 01:00:06.302
How nice of you to join us.

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:08.304
- I can explain.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:08.337 --> 01:00:09.972
They were gonna set
a trap on you.

01:00:10.005 --> 01:00:12.141
Clearly, we figured
that out, but thank you.

01:00:12.174 --> 01:00:14.376
- Where's the other one?
- Dead.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.478
You'll forgive me
if I don't trust you anymore,

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:19.581
so we'll double check
that when we're done here.

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:21.283
We're lucky
we were tracking you,

01:00:21.317 --> 01:00:24.320
but we'll circle back to that
betrayal thing in just a moment.

01:00:25.988 --> 01:00:28.257
Now, I'm not gonna hurt you
or kill you,

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:32.061
but whilst you are in my beautiful nature sanctuary...

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.299
...you will not enjoy
any unnatural advantages either.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:41.370
Nerd.

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:50.512
- Someone...
- Someone will what?

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:53.916
Replace you? Leak the secrets?

01:00:55.017 --> 01:00:56.285
Nobody cares.

01:00:56.318 --> 01:00:58.420
I've had US senators here,

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:01.457
- the general of one of those Asian armies...
- Lujo.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.294
Lujo. Hollywood directors,
rap superstars,

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:08.163
all come here
for the same reason.

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:10.432
The thrill of the hunt.

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:13.135
They don't care.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.006
Even that one guy
in your group...

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.909
What was his name?
Uh, Pecker? Poultry?

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:24.279
- Sergei.
- Sergei, close enough. Even him.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:27.182
He's some Russian tech genius
with direct ties

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.951
to the President
of the United States,

01:01:28.984 --> 01:01:31.120
who I am this close
to convincing

01:01:31.153 --> 01:01:33.222
to come out here
for a weekend.

01:01:33.255 --> 01:01:35.557
We're all good.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:38.327
Eh-ah.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:50.372
You can't keep your secrets
contained here forever.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:54.176
It's not just dinosaurs
you're killing, it's people.

01:01:54.209 --> 01:01:57.312
- People will care!
- Easy there.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.648
And if that happens,
we'll be insured.

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:01.183
Or on a beach somewhere.

01:02:01.216 --> 01:02:03.252
I hear Tahiti is nice
this time of year.

01:02:03.285 --> 01:02:06.555
- Do you like Tahiti, Riggs?
- I can dig it.

01:02:06.588 --> 01:02:09.691
How about you, Miss Parker?
Do you like Tahiti?

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.460
Tahiti is awesome.

01:02:11.493 --> 01:02:14.196
Visit the big Fuck You Island.
I hear it's beautiful.

01:02:44.259 --> 01:02:45.994
Whoa!

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.420
Hey, you. Hey, buddy,
wake up, come on! Hey!

01:03:51.159 --> 01:03:53.428
Jesus Christ!

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:02.705
What'd I miss?

01:04:04.339 --> 01:04:06.408
Bad guy won.

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:12.715
Your glasses.

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:17.185
Lindon got exactly
what he wanted.

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:21.724
I even killed more dinosaurs
to save myself.

01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:24.126
At least there's no
video evidence of that.

01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:26.528
This isn't funny!
This isn't a joke!

01:04:27.462 --> 01:04:29.631
This place...

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:32.634
It can't be stopped!

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:36.505
If Lindon dies, the corporation
will just send another Lindon.

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:43.278
If I die, Lindon was right,
no one will care.

01:04:45.347 --> 01:04:46.582
Then don't die.

01:04:50.652 --> 01:04:52.387
Get out of this place.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.458
At least, you have your voice.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.796
Lindon can't control that.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:08.670
Give me the gun.

01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:25.520
Where are you going?

01:05:25.554 --> 01:05:29.658
To the truck.

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:43.171
Hello?
Hello, is anybody out there?

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:46.909
Somebody answer this now
or you're all fired!

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.310
<i>Lindon, is that you?</i>

01:05:48.343 --> 01:05:50.212
Of course, it's me!

01:05:50.245 --> 01:05:53.215
I need an immediate extraction.

01:05:53.248 --> 01:05:56.284
You send the whole team,
you send everyone!

01:05:56.318 --> 01:05:59.554
<i>Copy, we can do that.
What's your location?</i>

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:03.258
Somewhere near campsite...

01:06:04.626 --> 01:06:06.328
Somewhere near campsite two.

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:07.864
<i>But where near campsite two?</i>

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:11.500
How in the hell should I know!
That's your job!

01:06:11.533 --> 01:06:15.938
You come and get me.
Move your asses.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.940
<i>Do you have a tracking chip
or something?</i>

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.710
No, I don't have
a fucking tracking chip!

01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:23.980
On a side note,

01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:28.250
kill anyone and everything
that isn't me.

01:06:28.283 --> 01:06:30.585
You understand what I'm saying?
Clear this park.

01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:36.491
I'm talking dinosaurs, women,
babies, anyone who isn't me.

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:39.796
<i>Your boss,
the guy who signs your checks.</i>

01:06:46.468 --> 01:06:48.470
<i>Try to make
your way back to the gate, sir.</i>

01:06:48.503 --> 01:06:51.506
- <i>We'll find you.</i>
- <i>You clear this park, you understand?</i>

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.780
Well, bad luck, Parker.

01:06:57.814 --> 01:07:00.649
Keys are probably in the belly
of a pterodactyl somewhere.

01:07:00.682 --> 01:07:02.350
Can't you hotwire this thing?

01:07:02.384 --> 01:07:04.921
I mean, didn't they teach you
how to do that in Desert Storm?

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:10.292
No, they did not teach me how to hot
wire 2010 Tacoma in Desert Storm.

01:07:10.325 --> 01:07:11.994
I wasn't even in Desert Storm.

01:07:27.542 --> 01:07:30.847
Whoa! Oh, thank God,
I'm so glad you found me.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.416
I really need your help.
I think they're right behind me.

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:38.721
No.

01:07:38.755 --> 01:07:39.922
Fire.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:20.095
<i>Hello? Hello?
Does anyone copy?</i>

01:08:20.129 --> 01:08:22.697
- I copy.
- <i>Oh, good.</i>

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.533
<i>In case, you haven't noticed,
I'm still out here,</i>

01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:27.970
<i>somewhere south
of campsite two.</i>

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:29.805
<i>I've been walking for hours.</i>

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:32.607
Hours?
We would have seen him by now.

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.777
<i>Hello, can you hear me?</i>

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.411
Sir, are you sure it's south?

01:08:36.444 --> 01:08:39.749
<i>Yes, south! From campsite two,
toward the exit.</i>

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.984
- <i>I'm not a total idiot.</i>
- Okay, sir.

01:08:42.018 --> 01:08:44.653
We're close. We should be
seein' you any minute.

01:08:44.685 --> 01:08:46.688
<i>Okay, hop to, chop, chop.</i>

01:08:46.721 --> 01:08:48.758
<i>I keep hearing shit
in the bushes.</i>

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:54.496
Alright, it's clear.

01:08:56.732 --> 01:09:00.535
- Lindon could be wrong.
- It's possible.

01:09:00.569 --> 01:09:03.438
But if they get to the
exit before we do...

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:05.107
We have to fight our way out.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.376
We don't stand a chance.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:12.514
We have to find a way
around them and beat them out.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.956
Alright, hear me out.

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.935
Maybe he's dino-food by now.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.403
One can only hope.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.939
Should we call him?

01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:39.140
Go ahead.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:42.011
What the hell was that?

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:46.581
Sir? Mr. Lindon?

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:49.886
Maybe it was a dinosaur.

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:09.772
There's no way this works.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:12.775
It's a bag hanging from a tree.

01:10:12.808 --> 01:10:14.877
What's not to be curious about?

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:16.578
Well, they're just about
to walk...

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:28.090
Don't!

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.476
God, it smells.

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:51.847
Good. It shouldn't be long now.
Let's move.

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:07.529
Whoa, hey.

01:11:07.562 --> 01:11:09.564
Just me. Finally.

01:11:09.597 --> 01:11:12.268
Now, how hard was that, guys?
Where's transport?

01:11:14.236 --> 01:11:16.939
Oh, my God, what is that smell?

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.180
Oh, God. No, no.
Get away from me. Stay!

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:26.148
- What?
- You stay there.

01:11:26.182 --> 01:11:27.850
I gotta get out of here.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:31.087
You guys, you go that way,
I'm gonna go this way.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.228
Get 'em! Kill them!

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:08.784
Huh?

01:14:01.203 --> 01:14:02.771
Wait.

01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:03.739
What?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.208
We got another problem.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.248
- We are not alone either.
- How many?

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:16.719
Uh, two, three, maybe more.
I don't...

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:19.855
Alright,
we'll make a stand here.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:27.730
No, not this time.
You need to keep movin'.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.202
It's the only way.

01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:37.773
- Take this.
- You'll die.

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:52.788
Alright, I'll cover you
and you get out of here, okay?

01:14:58.794 --> 01:15:00.829
Happy hunting, Valentine.

01:15:00.863 --> 01:15:02.431
That's what I came to do.

01:15:03.999 --> 01:15:05.334
Don't look back.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:32.194
Really? Not one of you
could have followed her, huh?

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:39.134
Okay. Let's go!

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:41.030
Oh, uh, Miss Parker.

01:16:41.063 --> 01:16:42.531
Are you forgetting something?

01:16:44.199 --> 01:16:46.335
Give it to me.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:49.204
You know, it's never too late
to earn back my trust.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.173
Shut up and give me that key!

01:16:51.206 --> 01:16:54.276
Or what?
Or what, you'll shoot me?

01:16:54.310 --> 01:16:55.477
I don't think so.

01:16:56.545 --> 01:16:58.247
Last chance!

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.289
You know what? Then you do it.

01:17:07.323 --> 01:17:10.459
You shoot me right here,
and you take it from me!

01:17:24.206 --> 01:17:27.343
Oh, my God.

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:29.945
Oh, my God.

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.547
For a moment there
I wasn't 100% sure

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.350
which way it was gonna go.
I mean, it could have went either way.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:39.088
Whoo!
Oh, my God, that was intense.

01:17:39.121 --> 01:17:40.923
What do you want, Lindon?

01:17:42.558 --> 01:17:44.893
At this point,
I don't even know anymore.

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:50.032
I just... I just want you
out of my reserve.

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:53.135
Go tell your story,
tell whoever will listen.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:56.004
I already told you
it's not going to matter.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:18:00.442
We? We'll be back up in a week.
Back up and running.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:03.979
And you? You could be on
television with Sally Struthers

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.682
doing your
feed-the-dinosaur thing.

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:09.952
You know, for the price
of a cup of coffee a day,

01:18:09.985 --> 01:18:13.088
you could feed a stegosaurus
for a month, right?

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.326
All you have to do is just...

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:20.195
Just put down the gun and go.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:30.105
See? I'm a reasonable guy.

01:18:31.507 --> 01:18:33.409
Be sure to leave that
on your Yelp review.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:51.493
I can't believe
you're that stupid.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:56.498
Come on over here
and get on your knees.

01:18:59.668 --> 01:19:03.105
You really thought I'd let you
walk out of here alive

01:19:03.138 --> 01:19:05.240
after all the shit
you've pulled?

01:19:07.609 --> 01:19:09.746
No, Miss Parker.

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:15.217
I truly hope you are as flexible
as you are tenacious,

01:19:15.250 --> 01:19:21.256
because it's time to bend over
and kiss your ass goodbye.

01:19:32.501 --> 01:19:35.637
Please, not the face.
Not the face! Not the face!

01:19:41.677 --> 01:19:43.746
Give me the real key, fast!

01:19:59.328 --> 01:20:00.763
Listen, I think if we just...

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:08.604
Just kill me, get it over with.

01:20:09.538 --> 01:20:11.540
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:17.613
Remember?

01:20:19.716 --> 01:20:21.416
No collusion.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:33.662
- Okay, okay.
- Welcome to Jurassic Hunt, you son of a bitch.

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.163
No!

01:20:47.643 --> 01:20:50.512
Get back!

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.546
Did you miss me?

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:28.818
You're alive.

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:32.321
I told you not to look back.

01:21:35.223 --> 01:21:36.458
Now, let's get out of here.

01:21:56.368 --> 01:22:01.368
