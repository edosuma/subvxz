WEBVTT

00:09.477 --> 00:10.711
Wow.
(whistles)

00:10.744 --> 00:12.713
Must be the
right place.
Mm-hmm.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.548
Can I help you guys
with something?

00:14.582 --> 00:16.384
Oh, hi. Yeah, uh,
my boss sent me down here.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.619
I'm-I'm going undercover,
and I-I need a disguise

00:18.652 --> 00:19.820
that's good enough

00:19.853 --> 00:21.689
that even my own mother
wouldn't recognize me.

00:21.722 --> 00:25.359
Already got one that's
good enough to fool my dad.

00:25.393 --> 00:27.761
He's, uh...
he's kind of dopey.

00:27.795 --> 00:30.431
If-if you knew him,
you'd be cracking up.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.600
Hey, Nate, guess how I feel.

00:32.633 --> 00:33.767
You feel horny.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.203
I feel horny!

00:37.138 --> 00:39.407
Look, I-I just need
the disguise to be believable.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.275
This story could really
make my career.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.710
Maybe even go national.
Oh!

00:42.743 --> 00:44.845
I just, uh, don't want
to look like an amateur

00:44.878 --> 00:46.314
in a wig and glasses.

00:46.347 --> 00:47.548
Or Geraldo in the '80s.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.250
Got it. Have a seat.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.751
Joy, hop up.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.220
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.
Sit, sit, sit.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.123
I-I can stand
till he's ready. Wow.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.192
That is a scary mole
you put on her, by the way.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.227
Yikes!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.295
I'm Joy.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.231
I'll be your makeup artist.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.537
Yup. Geraldo.

01:13.307 --> 01:15.409
Geraldo with a mole.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.267
I'm standing here at the back
entrance of Pete Sheets,

01:39.300 --> 01:40.734
where, earlier today,
I went undercover

01:40.768 --> 01:42.536
wearing these special
camera glasses.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.805
Inside, I purchased
what were advertised

01:44.838 --> 01:49.310
as 800 thread count
Egyptian cotton sheets.

01:49.343 --> 01:52.613
But who takes the time
to actually count the threads?

01:52.646 --> 01:55.916
We do, and it didn't take long.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.587
16, 17, 18, 19...

01:59.620 --> 02:01.689
and done.

02:03.657 --> 02:04.425
That's right.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.627
These are 19
thread count sheets.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.597
And our lab results say,
the cotton is actually from...

02:09.630 --> 02:11.332
Detroit.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.701
Uh-uh, not on my watch.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.608
Hey, Pete, I'd like
to talk to you

02:20.641 --> 02:23.344
about these 800
thread count sheets.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.847
We've got a runner.
We've got a runner!

02:26.880 --> 02:31.785
Once again,
my Miller instinct was right.

02:31.819 --> 02:35.423
It's kind of a play on-on
killer instinct, because the...

02:35.456 --> 02:38.792
Hey, were you guys
even watching?

02:40.294 --> 02:40.994
Yeah. It was fantastic.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.430
Yeah! You-you were
good, son.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.598
DEBBIE:
So good. Great.
(alarm beeps)

02:44.632 --> 02:46.734
Oh, that's me.
It's time.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.236
Wait. Time for what, Dad?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.703
Time to start dating.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.907
Wait, you set an alarm
to remind you

02:53.941 --> 02:55.676
when it was time
to start dating?

02:55.709 --> 02:57.545
Well, after your mother
and I divorced,

02:57.578 --> 03:00.281
I decided I needed some time
alone to focus on me,

03:00.314 --> 03:02.716
so, uh, I set my watch
to beep in seven months,

03:02.750 --> 03:05.519
when I figured I'd be ready
to date, and it beeped.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.589
Time to date.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.990
Have you seen yourself lately?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.692
I'd hit the snooze button.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.364
Wait... wait-wait a second.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.432
Seven months?
Why... why seven?

03:18.466 --> 03:20.334
Well, after 43 years
of your mother's voice,

03:20.368 --> 03:23.537
I needed one month for the
ringing in my ears to go away.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.807
That's what that is.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.009
Then months two through six
to get in shape.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.811
My body had fallen
into disrepair

03:30.844 --> 03:32.946
with the last tenant;
needed some

03:32.980 --> 03:35.649
renovations
before it could be shown.

03:35.683 --> 03:38.519
Well, I hope you fix that leak.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.390
And the mold in the basement.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.358
I spent the last month
watching TV

03:44.392 --> 03:46.760
to learn techniques
for picking up ladies.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.697
Turns out the best advice
was on Animal Planet.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.667
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go make myself look big

03:53.701 --> 03:57.405
and expose my rear flank
to a receptive female.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.409
NATHAN:
Guys, we-we can't just let him

04:01.442 --> 04:02.410
go out there like that.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.612
He's gonna get rejected
by every woman he meets.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.780
And we know that he does not
handle rejection well.

04:06.814 --> 04:07.981
Yeah, Nathan's right.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.617
I mean, remember when they
turned down his business loan,

04:09.650 --> 04:10.584
last year at the bank?

04:10.618 --> 04:13.487
Well, no bank was gonna fund
his workout DVD,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.389
Sweatin' With the Oldie.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.927
Yeah, well, in protest,

04:19.960 --> 04:21.662
he withdrew
his entire life savings,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.497
and he stashed it
in our couch.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.632
There's also
a little in the chair

04:24.665 --> 04:28.736
because he read somewhere
it was good to diversify.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.338
Your father's gonna be fine.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.540
There are plenty
of lonely old women out there

04:32.573 --> 04:33.807
ready to snatch him up.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.710
He's like the last piece
of soggy, mangled bacon

04:36.744 --> 04:38.078
on a breakfast buffet.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.515
Gross, but still bacon.

04:41.549 --> 04:42.716
Yeah, but that's the problem.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.318
He'll probably settle down
with the first woman he meets.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.553
You know, if he just latches on

04:45.586 --> 04:47.821
to the first woman he sees,
this could be bad for all of us.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.957
I mean, I think we all know
that when it comes to women,

04:49.990 --> 04:52.793
Tom isn't exactly picky.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.063
Excuse me...?

04:56.096 --> 04:57.064
Sorry... (laughs)

04:57.097 --> 04:58.632
What I meant was,

04:58.666 --> 05:00.601
when it comes to women,
he'll take whatever he can get.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.702
Nope, that's not better.

05:03.704 --> 05:05.473
Plus, Dad's such
a creature of habit,

05:05.506 --> 05:07.107
so you know
he's gonna marry this woman.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.510
Which will make me a stepchild.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.844
A red-headed stepchild.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.746
We know how
that's gonna turn out.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.047
(groans)

05:14.081 --> 05:16.917
Those kids get killed at recess.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.453
Look, I think it's up to us
to find Dad a new girlfriend.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.389
And she has to be able
to take care of him.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.023
Yeah, and she better know CPR.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.826
Last week he nearly choked to
death on a scoop of ice cream.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.729
And you all make fun of me for
keeping a hairdryer in my car.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.899
And she needs to be decisive.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.368
Poor Tom freezes up
whenever anyone asks him

05:34.402 --> 05:35.436
his favorite color.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.771
As far as I know,
it's "blurple."

05:38.839 --> 05:40.073
And no murderers.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.376
I mean, I know that sounds
judgy and un-PC,

05:42.410 --> 05:43.911
but if someone
has killed somebody,

05:43.944 --> 05:46.980
I just have a hard time
trusting them.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.550
Yeah, no one's picking
a murderer, Adam.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.087
Look, let's just keep
our eyes open,

05:54.121 --> 05:56.056
and try to find someone
before he does.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.758
We better hurry,
because he's out there

05:57.791 --> 05:59.059
hitting on women right now.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.094
Hey.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.064
Uh, what's the name of that lady
down the street?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.999
Can you be more specific?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.902
Uh, wh-what's that movie where
they're looking for the fish?

06:08.936 --> 06:10.404
Finding Nemo?

06:10.438 --> 06:12.105
Yeah, and who plays
the daddy fish?

06:12.139 --> 06:13.974
Albert Brooks?

06:14.007 --> 06:15.976
Right, well,
this woman goes power-walking

06:16.009 --> 06:18.746
with that woman who looks
like Albert Brooks.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.148
Rebecca with all the cats?

06:21.181 --> 06:24.084
Rebecca! That's it!

06:24.117 --> 06:26.386
I just hit Rebecca with my car.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.762
Well, Rebecca's out.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.540
Y-You're sure
you don't know anybody

06:46.574 --> 06:47.541
who could date my dad?

06:47.575 --> 06:50.578
For free?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.112
No.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.548
Oh, hey!

06:54.582 --> 06:57.184
I caught your "Miller Instinct"
thing on the news.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.752
I like you standing up
for the little guy.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.220
Who you busting today?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.222
Oh, it's a,
it's a crooked doggy day care

07:02.255 --> 07:05.025
where, uh, beloved pets
are left unsupervised

07:05.058 --> 07:06.860
to fight amongst themselves.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.830
We're-we're calling it
"Lord of the Fleas."

07:11.098 --> 07:12.165
Yeah, no.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.503
I would've gone
with "Bite Club."

07:15.536 --> 07:18.038
I-I had that one
written down, too, so...

07:18.071 --> 07:19.607
if that's what it's called,

07:19.640 --> 07:22.576
just know that.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.013
Oh, I am so sorry
I'm late.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.848
I was in a restaurant

07:27.881 --> 07:30.250
and this old guy
starts choking on a steak.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.152
People didn't know what to do.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.021
So, I just grabbed a pen,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.956
and jammed it through his neck
to make an air hole.

07:37.725 --> 07:38.692
Oh, wow.

07:38.726 --> 07:42.262
What a decisive,
first-aid-knowing lady you are.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.498
You... you wouldn't
by any chance,

07:44.532 --> 07:45.232
happen to be single,
would you?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.267
Oh, recently.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.602
My husband passed away.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.804
Oh.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.206
You didn't murder him, did you?

07:57.745 --> 07:59.880
And she has no kids,

07:59.913 --> 08:03.183
which means no annoying
stepchildren or grandchildren.

08:03.216 --> 08:06.253
Christmas can still be
just all about us.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.056
Mom.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.190
Yes, I have a question.
Uh-huh.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.826
Is that giant brown mole
on her face

08:12.860 --> 08:15.228
a giant brown mole on her face?

08:15.262 --> 08:17.965
Mom, you're being
very insensitive.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.199
I don't care
one way or another.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.200
I just know your father.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.735
And whenever he sees a button,

08:21.769 --> 08:24.037
he has to press it.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.073
Listen, I'm-I'm sure if the mole
is that big of a deal,

08:26.106 --> 08:27.808
she can have it removed.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.809
No, if that could've
been removed,

08:28.842 --> 08:30.243
she would've done it already.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.680
Yeah, that thing must be
tugging on a vital organ.

08:32.713 --> 08:34.314
(clears throat)
Adam?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.617
Not that it matters,
because say hello

08:36.650 --> 08:39.252
to Dad's perfect mate,
Mrs. Walker,

08:39.286 --> 08:42.289
who also happens to be the vice
principal of Mikayla's school.

08:42.322 --> 08:45.325
Wait, she's sitting
in a wheelchair?

08:45.358 --> 08:47.928
No, she is sitting proudly
in a wheelchair.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.329
You can't see it,
but the bumper sticker

08:49.362 --> 08:52.600
on the back says,
"That's how I roll."

08:57.037 --> 08:58.906
Pardon the blur.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.209
But, uh, the lighting was bad
and she had a slight tremor.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.313
Anyway, she works
at the Yarn Barn

09:06.346 --> 09:08.616
and we could get
a friends-and-family discount.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.619
and I need
a new sewing machine.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.987
Mom, she's in her 90s.

09:14.021 --> 09:14.988
No, no.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.324
Mid-80s.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.159
Mid- to late mid-.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.094
88 tops.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.863
Look, sorry, Mom,
you're gonna have

09:22.896 --> 09:24.898
to keep paying full price
for your sewing supplies,

09:24.932 --> 09:26.266
because we're not setting
Dad up with a woman

09:26.299 --> 09:27.935
who's probably blurry
'cause she's

09:27.968 --> 09:29.903
halfway between this world
and the next.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.644
So, you think he's gonna be
that much happier with Spot?

09:36.677 --> 09:38.178
Hey...

09:38.211 --> 09:40.748
Come on, I think that we are
all on the same page

09:40.781 --> 09:42.783
with the level of woman
that Dad can get.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.118
And-and-and with all these
terrible women,

09:45.152 --> 09:46.319
Joy is the least terrible.

09:46.353 --> 09:47.721
(all talking over each other)

09:47.755 --> 09:49.056
No, come on! Look, it...

09:49.089 --> 09:51.792
Hey. What do we have here?

09:51.825 --> 09:54.194
I-I don't know.
We just walked in and...

09:54.227 --> 09:56.964
Adam had these up.

09:56.997 --> 09:57.965
Pervert!

09:57.998 --> 09:59.266
What?!

10:00.333 --> 10:02.836
Look, Dad, we know that you
wanted to start dating,

10:02.870 --> 10:05.773
so we decided to try
to help you pick somebody, so...

10:05.806 --> 10:08.375
Look at you guys
worrying about me.

10:08.408 --> 10:11.011
Well, let's see
who you came up with.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.279
Hmm!

10:12.312 --> 10:13.814
Girl with the mole looks pretty.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.717
Bet old Ironsides here
gets good parking.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.656
Hmm, this guy looks mean.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.425
That's a woman, and she is mean.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.661
Listen, I-I-I appreciate this,

10:27.695 --> 10:30.097
but, uh, I'm already
seeing somebody.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.398
Wait, you're-you're seeing
somebody?

10:31.431 --> 10:32.833
When did you meet somebody?

10:32.866 --> 10:34.434
Well, that day
my alarm went off,

10:34.467 --> 10:36.737
I went to the bookstore,
she was working the register,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.405
I asked her out, she said yes,

10:38.438 --> 10:40.373
we went out,
repeated that twice,

10:40.407 --> 10:42.109
three times,
after tonight's date.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.945
That's why I'm here--
needed to hit the ATM.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.748
Oh, that one's out of order.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.950
Yeah, the zipper's broken.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.752
Not dispensing cash.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.421
Ah... (chuckles)

10:54.454 --> 10:55.422
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.424
Which-Which bookstore?

10:57.457 --> 10:59.159
I've said enough.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.695
I don't need you meddling
in my business.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.667
Boop!

11:15.375 --> 11:18.111
Hi. I'm here to pick up Ruth.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.980
I'll go let her know
you're here.
Yeah, good.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.153
What do you think he meant
by "meddling"?

11:26.186 --> 11:28.155
Who cares?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.322
Any sign of her?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.858
If she's dating your father,

11:30.891 --> 11:33.026
she's probably in
the Braille section.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.127
I'm just praying

11:34.161 --> 11:37.197
she's capable enough
to keep him alive.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.899
Hello, there.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.442
Well, she knows CPR.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.382
Younger, attractive,
oozing sexuality...

11:55.415 --> 11:58.351
I can't believe Tom divorced me
only to turn around

11:58.385 --> 12:00.453
and start dating the same woman.

12:00.487 --> 12:03.156
I can't believe how young
she looks in this picture.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.925
I bet she can still have
a baby.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.059
Maybe not a healthy one,

12:06.093 --> 12:08.829
but better than anything
Carol can whip up these days.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.498
What is happening with you?

12:11.531 --> 12:14.267
Are you just not scared
of me anymore?

12:14.301 --> 12:16.469
This just doesn't make
any sense.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.773
I mean, there's got to be
a simple explanation for this.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.441
Wait, wait-- maybe she just
looks young

12:21.474 --> 12:23.476
and has had a lot of work done.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.445
God, I wonder who her doctor is.

12:25.478 --> 12:28.248
Maybe she's just
into older men.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.516
No, I don't buy it.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.018
I think
something's going on.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.220
Wait, wait...

12:33.253 --> 12:35.355
guys, look at this.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.457
Dad's taken all the money

12:37.490 --> 12:38.391
out of his pillow bank.

12:38.425 --> 12:39.993
Oh, gosh!

12:40.027 --> 12:41.528
Oh, my gosh!

12:42.963 --> 12:46.800
Yeah, he's emptied out
his account at every branch!

12:49.036 --> 12:50.503
Wait a second--
Dad's been coming home

12:50.537 --> 12:51.571
and taking cash out of the couch

12:51.604 --> 12:54.474
to pay for whatever
this bookstore hussy wants.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.109
Adam, you know what we got here.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.577
Don't even say it.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.512
Classic Anna Nicole Smith story.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.882
Here we go.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.517
Anna Nicole and Howard Marshall
were in love,

13:04.551 --> 13:07.420
and I don't know why
you can't just deal with that.

13:07.454 --> 13:11.291
What weird thing are you weirdos
talking about now?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.493
Yeah, remember
when Anna Nicole Smith
was suing to get half

13:13.526 --> 13:14.928
of her rich old
husband's estate?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.097
Adam here was on her side.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.033
You two need to stop watching
so much television.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.369
Tom is hardly a millionaire.

13:22.402 --> 13:25.338
Even in death,
he's only worth $200,000--

13:25.372 --> 13:27.607
before taxes paid out
over three years,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.476
and it cannot look like suicide.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.578
(clears throat)

13:31.611 --> 13:34.447
You know what? I-I do stories
like this all the time.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.883
The smaller the scam the better.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.450
You're less likely
to file a complaint.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.487
Ugh, I bet she's got ten old
guys just like Dad on the hook.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.124
She probably
uses hard candy as bait.

13:44.157 --> 13:48.295
My Miller Instinct is telling me
that something's wrong.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.463
Your Miller what?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.564
It's my new segment.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.633
Come on. Do you even watch?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.568
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the segment!
Yeah, we do.

13:55.602 --> 13:56.469
All the time.
It's fantastic.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.604
It's good.
It's great.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.605
Look, I think we're all probably

13:58.638 --> 14:00.140
feeling like something's wrong,

14:00.173 --> 14:01.875
but we can't do anything
until we have some proof.

14:01.909 --> 14:05.512
Well, I've got just
the undercover man for the job.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.646
Oh? Who?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.149
Come on! Watch my show!

14:13.553 --> 14:15.455
What do you say?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.524
Let's catch a predator.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.575
Can you guys hear me?

14:35.608 --> 14:38.078
RAY: We can hear you.
We can't see anything.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.412
Put the glasses on.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.286
RAY: All right,
Nathan Cam is working.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.021
We'll see everything you see.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.423
Get ready to look
into a lot of mirrors.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.092
Hey, Nathan, she needs to think

14:52.125 --> 14:54.261
that you're
a vulnerable old man,

14:54.294 --> 14:57.330
so-so slouch more, seem confused
and just go on and on

14:57.364 --> 14:59.599
about the price of gas--
basically, be Dad.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.035
I've been studying Dad
my whole life.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
Watch this.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.241
Oh, no!

15:09.209 --> 15:12.445
(groaning)

15:12.479 --> 15:13.981
Well, that was wild!

15:14.014 --> 15:15.515
Are you okay?

15:15.548 --> 15:18.485
Yeah, I am such a klutz.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.421
Montgomery Sinclair,
what has gotten
into you today?

15:21.454 --> 15:23.690
RUTH:
Oh, don't worry. No damage done.

15:27.327 --> 15:30.197
Say, I'm-I'm-I'm looking
for a book.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.032
Uh, the title escapes me.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.301
My late wife used
to remember things like that,

15:34.334 --> 15:39.072
but she, uh, fell out of my jet,
was run over by my yacht.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.141
Sank from the weight
of all her diamonds.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.977
Do you know what
the book is about?

15:45.078 --> 15:48.015
Well, uh, yeah,
it was a biography.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.417
Say, what's the name of
that politician fellow

15:50.450 --> 15:51.985
some people like
and some people don't?

15:52.019 --> 15:53.353
Can you be more specific?

15:53.386 --> 15:56.456
Uh, what was that movie
about the guy with one arm

15:56.489 --> 15:58.058
who was being chased around
by everybody?

15:58.091 --> 15:58.925
The Fugitive?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.260
Yeah. What was the name
of that actor

16:00.293 --> 16:01.261
who was chasing him around?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.129
Tommy Lee Jones.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.597
Yeah, who was his college
roommate?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.167
I think it was Al Gore.
Well, that's it.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.501
I'm looking for a biography
on Bill Clinton.

16:08.535 --> 16:09.636
Right.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.770
I'll go check for you.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.605
(chuckles)

16:19.479 --> 16:20.580
(both yell)

16:20.613 --> 16:22.249
(all yell)

16:22.282 --> 16:24.717
(clears throat)

16:24.751 --> 16:26.019
Sorry about that.

16:26.053 --> 16:27.487
You-You-You startled me, kid.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.588
(chuckles)

16:28.621 --> 16:30.357
Sorry, sir.
You look very familiar.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.492
Did you grow up
in Lancaster County?

16:32.525 --> 16:33.760
Uh, no.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.462
Were you in
the textile business?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.164
Sorry.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.431
Did you go to Georgetown?

16:38.465 --> 16:39.332
Nope.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.633
Neither did I.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.669
I guess that must be
what it is.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.173
(clears throat)

16:46.206 --> 16:47.074
(hushed):
He's here.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.510
We know. Stay close
enough so we can hear.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.679
Tom!

16:52.712 --> 16:53.813
They called me today.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.316
Who?
You know who.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.817
I knew this day
would come.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.153
But that's what I get
for dating a spy.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.454
ALL:
What?!

17:01.488 --> 17:04.091
I never meant
to get involved with you.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.259
But then I realized
it was fate.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.095
I mean, what are the odds

17:08.128 --> 17:10.630
that a super spy like me
bumps into a pretty girl

17:10.663 --> 17:14.534
that just happened
to be reading a novel
about a super spy?

17:16.169 --> 17:18.638
Tom's not a spy!
He's a player!

17:18.671 --> 17:21.074
Hit it and quit it, Tommy!
(laughs)

17:21.108 --> 17:22.509
Thank you, Tom.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.445
I'll never forget the time
we were out to dinner

17:25.478 --> 17:27.380
and that KGB operative
poisoned you,

17:27.414 --> 17:29.649
and you had to spend
the whole night
in the bathroom.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.751
Yes, those dirty Russians.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.587
They got me again
this morning.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.656
I'll never forget you.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.260
I needed a little excitement
in my life.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.695
Mm, don't we all?

17:49.369 --> 17:53.606
Poor girl, she has no idea
he's thinking about me.

17:55.142 --> 17:56.109
(gasps)

17:56.143 --> 17:57.344
For national
security reasons,

17:57.377 --> 17:59.412
I can't let you see
which way I leave.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.614
So I'm gonna need you
to step into the back

18:01.648 --> 18:03.150
and count to a million.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.551
(chuckles)

18:14.427 --> 18:15.695
Were you listening to me?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.864
Oh, no, I was just,
uh... (clears throat)

18:17.897 --> 18:18.898
No, it's okay.

18:18.931 --> 18:23.736
Uh, I guess you heard
all that spy stuff, huh?

18:23.770 --> 18:26.506
A little secret: I'm not a spy.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.875
Oh, you don't say.
(chuckles)

18:28.908 --> 18:31.611
Well, why were you,
why were you telling

18:31.644 --> 18:33.580
that, uh, nice woman there
that you are?

18:33.613 --> 18:34.681
You single?

18:34.714 --> 18:36.349
Recently, yes.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.685
Then you'll understand.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.720
I lied to get sex.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.556
I was afraid that was gonna be
your answer. (chuckles)

18:43.590 --> 18:45.725
We both got what we wanted.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.628
She got that excitement
of being with a secret agent

18:48.661 --> 18:49.829
and I got sex.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.765
And it was good, brother.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.904
Okay, I wanted to peg you
as a ladies' man.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.439
Yeah, well, I didn't know

18:59.472 --> 19:01.674
I was gonna be
so good at it, either.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.544
If my family knew,
it would've blown their minds.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.313
You should have seen
the train wrecks

19:06.346 --> 19:07.814
they tried to set me up with.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.183
My lady did die yesterday,

19:10.217 --> 19:12.752
so I can't argue.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.587
Well, I'm sure

19:14.621 --> 19:16.756
they were just
doing their best.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.292
Yeah, it's better
that they don't know, anyway.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.728
I kind of like leading
a double life.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.665
Hey, in a way, I guess
I am like a spy.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.567
Yeah, I guess.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.370
But would it be so bad
if you just told 'em?

19:30.403 --> 19:31.638
Why-Why do you feel

19:31.671 --> 19:33.873
like you need to keep that side
of you hidden?

19:33.906 --> 19:36.443
I don't know.
I guess I'm afraid

19:36.476 --> 19:38.911
that if they see me doing okay
on my own,

19:38.945 --> 19:40.580
they might stop worrying
about me and...

19:40.613 --> 19:43.316
it's nice to know
that no matter what,

19:43.350 --> 19:44.351
someone cares.

19:45.385 --> 19:47.754
I'm sure they do, kid.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.923
ALL:
Aw...

19:50.957 --> 19:52.792
Little tip for you.

19:52.825 --> 19:56.229
Watch Animal Planet's
Mating Mammals.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.965
Every sex move you'll ever need
is in that show.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.268
The style we learned from dogs?

20:01.301 --> 20:02.869
Just the beginning.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.238
ALL:
Ew!
Ugh.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.539
(grunts)

20:06.573 --> 20:07.607
Take care.
Yeah.

20:07.640 --> 20:08.575
(chuckles)

20:08.608 --> 20:12.345
You know, now I know why
you look so familiar.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.713
You remind me of my son.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.849
Oh, I'm sure he'll age
a lot better than this.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.551
He sounds handsome.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.787
42 years ago,

20:20.820 --> 20:23.923
you didn't sleep with a woman
named Carol, did you?

20:23.956 --> 20:27.460
I promise you I did not.

20:28.961 --> 20:32.565
Well, if you ever get
the chance, don't.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.704
I guess Dad's gonna be okay.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.973
Oh, The History of NASA, huh?

20:41.007 --> 20:44.844
You know, it's impossible
to kiss in space?

20:44.877 --> 20:47.314
I should know;
I was an astronaut.

20:51.884 --> 20:55.855
Looks like my Miller Instinct
was a little off this time.

20:55.888 --> 20:56.756
Your Miller what?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.591
Oh, come on, man,
you're my cameraman!
