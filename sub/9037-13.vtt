00:04.104 --> 00:06.672
- Hello?

00:06.674 --> 00:08.407
Anybody home?

00:08.409 --> 00:12.745
- Oh.
[muttering]

00:12.747 --> 00:14.246
- Raymond?

00:18.551 --> 00:20.285
Hello?

00:25.425 --> 00:27.292
[clattering]

00:36.803 --> 00:38.437
- Hey.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.472
- Raymond,
what are you doing?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.807
- I'm--I'm playing

00:41.809 --> 00:44.410
Hide-and-seek
with the kids here.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.146
- Oh, hide-and-seek.
Move over.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.447
[laughs]

00:57.357 --> 00:58.457
What's this?

00:58.459 --> 00:59.792
- Oh, that's the invitation

00:59.794 --> 01:02.261
To tom and marianne's
baby shower this weekend.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.261
- Baby shower?

01:03.263 --> 01:05.064
Why is it addressed
to both of us?

01:05.066 --> 01:07.166
- 'cause you're invited too.
It's for couples.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.166
- Couples?
- Yeah.

01:08.168 --> 01:12.104
- Well, since when does the guy
have to go to that?

01:12.106 --> 01:13.105
Oh, come on.

01:13.107 --> 01:17.176
They're screwing
with nature now.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.677
- Well, you know,
it's their first baby.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.080
They're still excited.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.080
"dear ray and debra,

01:22.082 --> 01:24.817
We hope each of our guests
will make a presentation."

01:24.819 --> 01:26.285
- What?

01:26.287 --> 01:28.353
- "you can recite a poem,
do a skit.

01:28.355 --> 01:33.492
The proud parents will tape it
as a tribute for the child."

01:33.494 --> 01:35.127
- Tribute?

01:35.129 --> 01:38.130
Oh, who's she's got
in there, gandhi?

01:38.132 --> 01:39.364
- I can't go by myself.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.165
You got to come with me.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.366
- [groans]

01:41.368 --> 01:44.169
- Debra, I got the twins down,

01:44.171 --> 01:47.139
And I made your bed,
and I hung up some clothes.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.508
I tell you so you
won't be shocked later.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.178
[men shouting]

01:53.180 --> 01:54.379
- What is that?

01:54.381 --> 01:57.149
- Huzzah! Huzzah!

01:57.151 --> 01:59.618
- It's my dad
and his crazy friend harry,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.687
And they're running
at our house.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.226
- Marie, water.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.794
- What are you doing, dad?

02:08.796 --> 02:12.397
- Attacking your house.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.900
- Harry got your father back
into the civil war reenacting.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.635
- Damn glad I did.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.237
I'm proud to lead
this beautiful bastard

02:18.239 --> 02:20.639
Into battle.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.441
- So you're one of those guys

02:22.443 --> 02:24.510
Who, like, gets dressed up
in uniforms

02:24.512 --> 02:27.279
And recreates battles and...

02:27.281 --> 02:30.682
- I like war.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.584
- Your father's a lieutenant.

02:32.586 --> 02:33.819
- It's make-believe, ma.

02:33.821 --> 02:38.257
He could be lincoln
if he wanted to.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.291
- Ah, miss marie.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.226
- Hello, harry.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.327
- Please, ma'am,
call me jeb.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.496
- Oh, well.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.698
Hello, jeb.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.201
- You are a sight
for sore eyes.

02:49.203 --> 02:54.173
- And mine
are pretty sore.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.908
- Dad, what are you getting back
into this now for?

02:55.910 --> 02:58.544
- Next weekend
is our big 25th anniversary.

02:58.546 --> 02:59.811
We're reenacting
our reenactment

02:59.813 --> 03:01.647
Of the battle of gettysburg.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.582
Clink!

03:03.584 --> 03:06.285
- Hey, ray, about next weekend,
I was wondering--

03:06.287 --> 03:09.188
- Wait a minute. Whoa, whoa.
4:00 already.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.423
I got to call that guy.
The darn guy. Darn it.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.824
- What guy?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.661
- The darn guy about the thing
with the, uh--

03:15.663 --> 03:16.662
The other guy.

03:16.664 --> 03:20.966
Get in here.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.569
- Good cover, ray.
You're brilliant at this.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.470
- My father's about to ask me
to go to this war thing.

03:25.472 --> 03:26.738
What am I gonna do?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.874
- Well, you tell him
you can't do it.

03:28.876 --> 03:33.312
- I can't just turn him down.
Look how excited he is.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.780
No.
No.

03:34.782 --> 03:37.316
I got to tell him
I'm going somewhere else.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.784
- Well, you are going
somewhere else.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.419
You're going
to the baby shower.

03:40.421 --> 03:44.356
- Oh, god.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.391
Hey, what if I tell him

03:46.393 --> 03:48.227
I'm going
to the baby shower, right?

03:48.229 --> 03:49.695
He goes to his thing,
you go to your thing,

03:49.697 --> 03:54.299
And I make sure
that things are good here.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.835
- Hey, no.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.504
- Uh, hey, ray,
we're gonna get going,

03:59.506 --> 04:02.975
But I wanted to ask you
about next weekend.

04:02.977 --> 04:06.411
- Yeah, next weekend
I'm going to a baby shower.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.679
- What?

04:07.681 --> 04:10.515
- Yeah.
It's for couples.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.515
That's how they do it now.

04:11.517 --> 04:14.353
- Well, I was gonna ask you,
since I'm gonna be at war,

04:14.355 --> 04:17.256
If you wouldn't mind
taking out my recyclables.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.790
- That's what
you wanted to ask me?

04:18.792 --> 04:20.559
- Yeah.

04:20.561 --> 04:24.997
Hey, you know what my son's
doing while I'm out fighting?

04:24.999 --> 04:27.966
He's going
to a baby shower.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.668
- Oh, yeah?

04:29.670 --> 04:30.869
Back in civil war days,

04:30.871 --> 04:33.972
We had names
for guys like you.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.374
They're pretty much
like the names

04:35.376 --> 04:39.678
We have for you today.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.414
- All right.
This house is secure.

04:42.416 --> 04:45.684
I want lunch!

04:45.686 --> 04:47.919
- May I escort you
across the street, miss marie?

04:47.921 --> 04:51.056
- Thank you, jeb.
What a gentleman.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.392
- Hey, if you're gonna act
like you're stealing her away,

04:53.394 --> 04:54.426
Don't tease me.

04:54.428 --> 04:58.664
Steal her away!

04:58.666 --> 05:01.400
Have a nice shower, nancy.

05:05.905 --> 05:06.904
- Hey, ray, listen.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.540
I was thinking about
what we could do

05:08.542 --> 05:10.542
For our presentation
for the baby shower.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.743
- Oh, I was thinking
about that too.

05:11.745 --> 05:12.744
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.479
Here's what I was thinking.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.081
We could get up there
right in front of everybody--

05:16.083 --> 05:17.081
This will be great--

05:17.083 --> 05:22.087
And then I put an ax
through my head, all right?

05:22.089 --> 05:24.556
Then you do
the presentation by yourself

05:24.558 --> 05:27.592
Because, thank god,
I'm dead.

05:32.465 --> 05:36.001
- You know,
as much as I like that,

05:36.003 --> 05:38.804
It's gonna be tough
to follow.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.772
- Please, don't make me go.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.841
- Look, as bad as this shower
might be,

05:42.843 --> 05:45.577
It doesn't even compare
to your dad's civil war thing.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.845
Think about
your poor brother.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.747
- Yeah.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.450
Why?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.018
- 'cause he's going to it.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.653
I mean, can you imagine
being stuck in a tent

05:54.655 --> 05:55.854
With your dad?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.391
That's where
you need the ax.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.826
- Wait a minute.
Robert's going to this thing?

06:00.828 --> 06:02.094
- Yeah.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.462
- My dad asked him to go?

06:03.464 --> 06:08.133
- Uh, yeah.
Your mom told me.

06:08.135 --> 06:12.371
- What, robert's so great?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.372
- No, I don't think that--

06:13.374 --> 06:16.541
- And I get the recycling.

06:16.543 --> 06:17.776
He doesn't even ask me.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.978
I mean, my father should ask me,
shouldn't he?

06:19.980 --> 06:22.647
Why didn't he ask?

06:22.649 --> 06:23.982
- Well, would you have gone?

06:23.984 --> 06:27.452
- Of course not.

06:27.454 --> 06:30.555
But why does he want robert
to go and not me?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.491
What's wrong with me?

06:36.596 --> 06:39.631
- Ray, I didn't know
that you'd be feeling so--

06:39.633 --> 06:41.032
Wait a minute.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.667
You're not acting all hurt

06:42.669 --> 06:44.503
Just so I'll tell you
you should go with your dad

06:44.505 --> 06:48.740
So that you can get out
of the baby shower, are you?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.842
- I'm not that smart.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.750
Hey.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.819
- Hey.
- Mm.

07:00.821 --> 07:01.820
- Whoa, man.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.722
It's pretty cold out there.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.490
What is that, breakfast?

07:05.492 --> 07:07.993
- An authentic
civil war breakfast.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.661
- Your mother
makes a hell of a jerky.

07:09.663 --> 07:14.766
- Yeah, you could swear
this was made in 1863, huh?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.134
- So you guys, you're really
looking forward

07:16.136 --> 07:17.569
To this reenactment thing, huh?

07:17.571 --> 07:19.037
- Hey, can't wait.

07:19.039 --> 07:23.175
Violence without paperwork.

07:23.177 --> 07:24.609
- So I guess everybody
who signed up,

07:24.611 --> 07:25.644
What are they,

07:25.646 --> 07:26.878
They're already
signed up already?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.214
- Yeah.
Why?

07:29.216 --> 07:31.650
- I don't know.

07:31.652 --> 07:32.818
- What are you saying?

07:32.820 --> 07:35.620
You want to go
to the reenactment?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.489
- You asking me?

07:37.491 --> 07:38.690
- You want to go?

07:38.692 --> 07:41.593
- I don't know.
You asking me?

07:41.595 --> 07:42.961
- If I ask you,
would you go?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.062
- Are you asking raymond?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.131
- I don't know.
Does he want to go?

07:46.133 --> 07:47.466
- Why are you asking me?

07:47.468 --> 07:48.800
- I don't--
do you want to go?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.969
- All right, all right,
I'll go!

07:50.971 --> 07:54.506
Thank you for asking.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.941
- All right,
I got to go over to harry's

07:55.943 --> 07:58.243
And tell him we need
another uniform.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.244
- Can't you call him?

07:59.246 --> 08:00.612
- No.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.481
In his world, the phone
won't be invented

08:02.483 --> 08:04.649
For another 13 years.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.226
- What?

08:14.228 --> 08:16.127
- You really want
to do this, huh?

08:16.129 --> 08:20.065
- Well, you're going.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.933
- Do you have any idea
what you're getting into?

08:21.935 --> 08:24.035
- Well, yeah.
Yeah.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.637
- No bed,

08:25.639 --> 08:26.938
No heat,

08:26.940 --> 08:28.573
No shower.

08:28.575 --> 08:30.141
Weather report
for next weekend:

08:30.143 --> 08:32.544
Snow.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.545
- All right.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.614
- Meals are hardtack, jerky,

08:35.616 --> 08:38.617
And whatever water
you can wring out of your socks.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.285
- Oh, so you're this
big civil war freak now

08:40.287 --> 08:42.020
Just 'cause dad asked you
to go first, right?

08:42.022 --> 08:44.089
- He didn't ask me.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.090
- What?

08:45.092 --> 08:46.725
- He didn't ask me.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.760
Since when does dad ask us
to do anything with him?

08:48.762 --> 08:53.598
I had to enlist.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.603
- Oh, god,
I don't believe this!

08:58.605 --> 09:00.906
I only did this because--

09:00.908 --> 09:05.110
- Because you thought
he asked me and not you.

09:05.112 --> 09:08.046
And now you have to go.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.950
[cackles]

09:11.952 --> 09:15.020
Hey, better bring
a newspaper.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.922
- They had newspapers then.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.690
- They didn't have
toilet paper.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.832
- Debra.
- Hmm?

09:27.834 --> 09:30.268
- "newsday" or "usa today"...

09:34.006 --> 09:35.807
Which is softer?

09:39.111 --> 09:42.147
- I don't know.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.148
- I'll bring 'em both.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.716
I'll read one of 'em.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.655
- What's all that stuff?

09:50.657 --> 09:51.655
- It's for that
reenactment thing.

09:51.657 --> 09:54.059
I got to go over to my father's
house tomorrow and get ready.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.327
- Oh, what are you bringing?

09:55.329 --> 09:58.330
- Essentials.
You know, stuff for war.

09:58.332 --> 10:00.865
- Rice krispie treats?

10:00.867 --> 10:03.168
I don't think they had those
in the civil war.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.836
- I never read that anywhere.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.071
- Itty bitty book light?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.006
- Yeah, all right.
Take it easy, okay?

10:08.008 --> 10:09.240
I got to get ready.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.642
- What do you mean?
It's a week away.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.010
I thought you were dreading
this thing.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.244
- I am dreading it,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.879
The war part.

10:14.881 --> 10:17.682
- The war part.
What else is there?

10:17.684 --> 10:20.318
- Well, there's my father.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.786
You know,
it's the weirdest thing.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.955
At first, I just wanted
to get asked,

10:23.957 --> 10:26.091
But, you know, we never
did stuff together, me and him.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.994
Now I just--I kind of want
to go with him.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:30.731 --> 10:33.298
War makes people
do crazy things.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.237
Hello?

10:39.239 --> 10:41.272
- Hey, ray, we're down here
in the basement.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.774
- Yeah, come on down, ray.

10:42.776 --> 10:46.678
Check your skirt
at the door.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.213
- Hey, did harry
drop off my uniform?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.881
- He's on his way over now.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.416
I was just about
to show robert

10:51.418 --> 10:53.151
How to act
when you get shot.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.253
- What, like upset?

10:55.255 --> 10:58.189
- No.
No, it's got to be realistic.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.391
Here.
Here, let me show you.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.393
Robert, make a gunshot noise.

11:01.395 --> 11:03.995
- What caliber, .22 or--
what are you, .45?

11:03.997 --> 11:05.664
- Ray.
- Bang.

11:05.666 --> 11:06.931
- [groans]

11:06.933 --> 11:08.433
I'm hit.

11:08.435 --> 11:11.236
Keep fighting, men.

11:11.238 --> 11:14.205
Kill those rebel bastards.

11:19.445 --> 11:20.779
Abigail.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.216
Dear abigail,

11:25.218 --> 11:27.185
My pretty, young,

11:27.187 --> 11:32.023
Non-nagging
civil war wife.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.292
Oh, abigail.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.363
See?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.832
Getting shot is fun.

11:40.834 --> 11:44.736
- Not if you're watching.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.005
- Oh, here, I think I pulled
everything I have.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.340
Give me a hand.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.076
- Come on.
- There you go.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.277
You all right, dad?

11:52.279 --> 11:53.878
- Sure, sure.
Thanks.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.213
See?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.782
That's what the civil war
is about,

11:57.784 --> 12:00.285
Families coming together...

12:00.287 --> 12:02.854
- To kill other families.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.857
- Amen.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.225
- Hey, you know
what just occurred to me?

12:07.227 --> 12:08.960
If someone really dies,

12:08.962 --> 12:11.963
You don't find out about it
till the car ride home.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.164
- Look at this.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.299
Look at this
old pocket knife.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.067
It's got initials on it: A.B.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.502
Who's a.B.?

12:17.504 --> 12:20.138
- Albert barone, my father.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.406
- Oh, yeah?
He gave that to you?

12:21.408 --> 12:22.474
- Yeah, yeah.

12:22.476 --> 12:23.908
- It's pretty cool.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.410
When?
When did he give you this?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.780
- Yeah, we were always camping,
hiking, canoeing.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.149
Guess he gave it to me
on one of those trips.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.451
- Oh, yeah?
Hey, this is history.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.919
I can take this
on the reenactment with me.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.488
- No, no.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.823
They had no knives like this
during the civil war.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.425
Everything has to be
completely authentic.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.260
- Yeah.
- See these pants?

12:42.262 --> 12:45.864
No zipper.

12:45.866 --> 12:49.033
- Good luck with that.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.034
- Good morning, men.

12:50.036 --> 12:54.439
- Morning, sir!
- Morning, sir!

12:54.441 --> 12:57.142
- Hi.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.811
- You'll be pleased to know
that the battlefield is ours.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.280
The carnival and the petting zoo
have moved on.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.416
- Huzzah!
- Huzzah!

13:05.418 --> 13:07.418
- Here's your uniform.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.453
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.854
This is a different color.

13:09.856 --> 13:11.156
- You didn't tell him?

13:11.158 --> 13:12.190
- Oh, yeah.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.925
The south's short a few guys,

13:13.927 --> 13:15.560
So you're gonna have
to fight on their side.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.962
- [cackles]

13:17.964 --> 13:19.998
- South?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.800
Come on, I don't want
to fight on the south.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.468
I want to be with you guys
at this thing.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.103
- A rebel in a union camp?

13:25.105 --> 13:27.272
That is out
of the question, soldier.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.174
- I'm not a rebel!

13:29.176 --> 13:30.475
Come on.
I don't know those guys.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.844
I'm gonna be all shy.

13:32.846 --> 13:37.048
- Don't make me slap you.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.284
- I'm never gonna pass
for a southerner, okay?

13:39.286 --> 13:42.020
What if they
hear me talk?

13:42.022 --> 13:45.089
- Maybe they'll hang you
as a spy.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.991
- Robert,
want to give me a hand?

13:46.993 --> 13:49.928
I have a cannon
in the trunk of my car.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.497
- Sir, yes, sir!

13:52.499 --> 13:53.497
- Wait.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.533
Robert, talk to this guy,
will you?

13:55.535 --> 13:57.268
Come on, I don't want to fight
for the south.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.839
I can't eat grits
and say "y'all."

14:00.841 --> 14:02.307
- I like you on the other side.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.242
It's more authentic.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.078
Brother against brother.

14:07.080 --> 14:12.884
[whistling "the battle hymn
of the republic"]

14:15.254 --> 14:16.955
- Oh, my feet are killing me.

14:16.957 --> 14:21.125
I think these boots
are a size too small.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.125
Tell me, what's it say

14:22.127 --> 14:24.996
On the bottom
of my right boot?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.598
- "left."

14:29.435 --> 14:31.569
- Oh, crap.
What's it say on the other one?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.872
- Guess.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.274
- All right, help me off
with them, will you?

14:36.276 --> 14:38.977
- Hey, dad, are you sure

14:38.979 --> 14:40.979
I can't be
on your side at this thing?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.348
- I told you, the south's
a few guys short.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.884
Look, try yanking
from the heel, okay?

14:45.886 --> 14:47.952
- You know, I kind of thought

14:47.954 --> 14:49.654
I'd be on your side
on this thing, you know,

14:49.656 --> 14:51.456
With you.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.057
- Look, I know
what you're worried about.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.926
If we should come
face-to-face out there,

14:54.928 --> 14:58.162
I'll just shoot you
in the hand, all right?

14:58.164 --> 14:59.497
Aah!
You're twisting.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.132
What's the matter with you?

15:01.134 --> 15:02.901
- Look, either I'm on your side
on this thing,

15:02.903 --> 15:04.402
Or I'm not gonna go, okay?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.970
- You can't desert now.

15:05.972 --> 15:06.971
- There's no desert, dad.

15:06.973 --> 15:08.973
There's no war here!

15:08.975 --> 15:10.942
It's just dressing up
in costumes

15:10.944 --> 15:11.943
Like it's Halloween,

15:11.945 --> 15:17.215
With your friend harry/jeb.

15:17.217 --> 15:20.051
- You shut up now.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.020
This means something to us.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.022
There's camaraderie here.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.057
There's spirit.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.960
You don't understand anything
about this.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.561
You have no idea
what it feels like

15:30.563 --> 15:32.263
To stand on a battlefield

15:32.265 --> 15:35.600
Pretending to fight
for something you believe in.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.373
- Look, I'm not talking
about that, dad, okay?

15:42.375 --> 15:43.675
- Then why do you want to go?

15:43.677 --> 15:46.044
- Believe it or not,
to be with you.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.979
Why can't you do something
with me for once?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.181
- What are you talking about?
We do stuff.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.684
- What? What do we do, dad?
What? What do we ever do?

15:52.686 --> 15:54.585
- I can't believe
you're giving me all this grief

15:54.587 --> 15:56.721
Just because you're not
on my side in this thing.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.957
I'm sorry I asked you to go.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.358
- You didn't ask me to go.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.526
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.161
- I said, "do you want to go?"

16:03.163 --> 16:04.595
- Yeah, you said,
"do you want to go?"

16:04.597 --> 16:07.598
Not, "do you want to go
because I want you to go?"

16:12.137 --> 16:14.572
- Oh, my god.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.441
You are gonna
get passed around the campfire

16:16.443 --> 16:18.609
Like a bag of chips.

16:22.614 --> 16:24.182
- All right.
Forget about it, then.

16:24.184 --> 16:25.616
Forget it.
I won't go.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.151
All right.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.155
You know, I just--
I thought maybe you--

16:31.157 --> 16:32.590
We could do something
together for once,

16:32.592 --> 16:34.592
You know, like you did
with your father.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.427
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

16:36.429 --> 16:38.196
What do you mean
what am I talking about?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.764
Didn't you just tell me
he gave you the knife?

16:39.766 --> 16:41.566
He took you hunting
and fishing and canoeing.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.201
Didn't you just
tell me that, dad?

16:43.203 --> 16:45.236
Or what,
is that all pretend too?

16:55.214 --> 16:57.115
It is.
It is, isn't it?

17:01.387 --> 17:03.688
- Are you gonna help me off
with the damn boots or what?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.334
- Turn.
Turn the foot, dad.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.668
Turn your foot.

17:20.806 --> 17:25.543
- You know,

17:25.545 --> 17:29.047
I tried to be better than him.

17:29.049 --> 17:32.750
- I know, dad.
I know.

17:32.752 --> 17:35.353
- Look, you're good at that,
aren't you,

17:35.355 --> 17:38.289
Doing stuff
with your kids?

17:38.291 --> 17:40.558
- I'm all right.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.428
I could be better too.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.563
You know, but they'll probably
be better with their kids,

17:45.565 --> 17:49.567
So we're on
the right track here.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.602
Your great, great grandchildren

17:51.604 --> 17:56.107
Will probably
be excellent parents.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.708
- Yeah.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.478
So are you gonna
come to this thing

18:00.480 --> 18:02.547
With me or not?

18:02.549 --> 18:04.682
- All right.
Stop asking.

18:04.684 --> 18:08.219
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come here. Come here.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.555
I got to teach you
the civil war handshake.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.823
- Dad.
- Here, not like that.

18:11.825 --> 18:14.225
You got to clasp forearms
like this.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.726
- Right.
- It's stronger.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.195
- Like this here?

18:17.197 --> 18:18.296
- Yeah.
- Okay.

18:23.402 --> 18:28.172
You know, you're shaking hands
with a confederate here.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.476
- Yeah, you don't have
much of a grip there, nancy.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.479
[both laugh]

18:36.548 --> 18:38.549
- Debra?
Debra, you've got to see this.

18:38.551 --> 18:40.318
Come on.

18:47.593 --> 18:52.130
- We're just here
to say farewell to our kinfolk.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.465
- Ray, your ride's here.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.672
[all chuckling]

19:13.418 --> 19:14.652
- Listen, if I don't come back,

19:14.654 --> 19:18.723
It's 'cause I died
of embarrassment.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.525
- [with a southern accent]
well, I do declare,

19:20.527 --> 19:22.927
You look so very fine
in your uniform.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.562
I believe I've got the vapors.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.631
[chuckles]

19:26.633 --> 19:29.200
- Where were you last night?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.568
- Come on.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.869
I don't want them
to start without us.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.638
- That's right.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.641
All the good killing's
in the first five minutes.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.509
- Hey, kids, when I come back
from the war,

19:38.511 --> 19:40.378
We're gonna go
to the happy zone, right?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.812
- I hope you win, daddy.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.615
- Don't bet on it, kid.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.615
- Hey, here.

19:45.617 --> 19:47.318
Ray, sign this card
for the baby shower.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.319
- Oh, sorry.
Got to go.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.319
- Oh, come on.

19:49.321 --> 19:53.424
What am I gonna tell
tom and marianne?

19:53.426 --> 19:55.560
- Frankly, my dear...

19:58.797 --> 20:00.932
I don't give a damn.

20:00.934 --> 20:06.737
[sweeping orchestral music]

20:12.644 --> 20:14.345

[gunfire]

20:32.765 --> 20:34.832

20:34.834 --> 20:36.534
