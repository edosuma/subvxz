<i>And the Clippie goes to...</i>

00:52.178 --> 00:54.305
<i>Little Johnny Jensen!</i>

00:59.143 --> 01:01.312
Don't feel bad, son.

01:01.479 --> 01:03.690
We couldn't be
more proud of you.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.567
Unless, of course,
you had won the award.

01:05.775 --> 01:08.403
Man, you're so lucky
to have your family here.

01:08.486 --> 01:10.905
The stupid professor
didn't even show up for me.

01:11.155 --> 01:14.242
<i>I'd just like to
thank my awesome parents.</i>

01:14.450 --> 01:16.119
We love you, Johnny!

01:16.202 --> 01:17.203
Shh!

01:18.162 --> 01:20.081
<i>Now, to get all serious.</i>

01:20.331 --> 01:23.459
<i>It's time to pay tribute
to the brave delivery boys</i>

01:23.543 --> 01:27.130
<i>who gave their lives this past
year in the line of duty.</i>

01:28.590 --> 01:31.009

<i>Charles Kiley, train.</i>

01:35.513 --> 01:38.016
<i>Mike Pisarik, lion.</i>

01:39.767 --> 01:42.186
<i>They're on
the truck to Heaven now.</i>

01:43.229 --> 01:46.232
<i>Up next, the award
for Best Delivery Boy,</i>

01:46.357 --> 01:49.402
<i>Newspaper, Phone Book,

01:49.527 --> 01:51.738

<i>The nominees are</i>

01:54.157 --> 02:00.455
<i>Gene Tinker, Charles Kiley, Mike

02:15.386 --> 02:20.308
<i>Wow! I'd like to thank the
Academy of Delivery Sciences,</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.101
<i>my lovely robot, Bender,</i>

02:22.185 --> 02:26.189
<i>and most of all, my dear
nephew, Professor Farnsworth.</i>

02:28.358 --> 02:31.694
<i>He always has time for me, whether
it's sending me on a delivery,</i>

02:31.778 --> 02:35.490
<i>or just pulling me aside to
tell me I'm doing a bad job.</i>

02:35.573 --> 02:40.036
<i>And why? Because he's family, and
family is always there for each other.</i>

02:41.788 --> 02:45.375
<i>I'm sorry, but I can't keep
reading this tissue of lies.</i>

02:45.458 --> 02:49.629
<i>The truth is, Professor Farnsworth
is a cold, heartless jerk!</i>

02:53.466 --> 02:55.301
And the fish sticks
were limp!

03:00.348 --> 03:01.683
Ooh. Hefty.

03:01.766 --> 03:04.185
You could really bash in
a skull with this thing.

03:04.268 --> 03:05.770
I know, right?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.315
(CLEARING THROAT)

03:09.399 --> 03:13.611
What? Your awards show.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it,

03:13.695 --> 03:15.947
but I had a
very good reason.

03:16.072 --> 03:17.782
Perhaps you'd
favor us with it?

03:17.949 --> 03:20.660
My pleasure.
You see, I came down

03:20.785 --> 03:23.538
with a searing case
of "who-gives-a-crap?"

03:23.621 --> 03:24.789
(LAUGHING)

03:24.956 --> 03:26.249
(GROWLING)

03:27.083 --> 03:28.960
I wish I had more
living relatives.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.503
What about the
professor's parents?

03:30.628 --> 03:32.088
They're still alive?

03:32.171 --> 03:35.091
Sure, they exhibit
all the telltale signs.

03:35.174 --> 03:39.387
Toenails growing, hearts pumping
fluid, the whole shmagoigle.

03:39.512 --> 03:43.141
So where do these fossils live?
In sedimentary rock?

03:43.349 --> 03:46.561
(LAUGHING)

03:46.644 --> 03:49.647
No. According to
his next of kin file,

03:49.731 --> 03:53.401
they live in a virtual retirement
home on the Near-Death Star.

03:53.484 --> 03:57.822
I've been there. Let's boldly
go where we've gone before.

04:13.671 --> 04:16.089
Halt! Visitors
are forbidden.

04:16.257 --> 04:20.136
Oh, really? Does that rule
apply to Clippie winners?

04:20.219 --> 04:22.805
I'm sorry, sir.
Go right in.

04:24.265 --> 04:25.933
That's Philip J. Fry!

04:27.560 --> 04:33.024
Ned and Velma Farnsworth. 423,
Shadybrook Lane. Let's hover-roll.

04:35.818 --> 04:39.280
Fry, you're so confident
and take-charge on this trip.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.573
It's kind of a turn-on.

04:40.656 --> 04:43.117
Not now, Leela. I'm trying
to meet old people.

04:47.789 --> 04:52.835
<i>(2001: A SPACE</i> ODYSSEY

04:52.919 --> 04:54.295
(DOOR BELL CHIMES)

04:57.465 --> 05:01.093
My God!
It's full of geezers.

05:11.395 --> 05:12.897
FRY: Hey, why are they
hooked up like that?

05:12.980 --> 05:15.650
Is it some kind of Craft-matic:
adjustable death bed?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.819
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
Don't be ridiculous.

05:17.902 --> 05:20.488
Their bodies are being used
to generate electricity.

05:20.571 --> 05:23.533
The idea came from an old
movie called The Matrix.

05:23.616 --> 05:27.829
But wouldn't almost anything make a
better battery than a human body?

05:27.912 --> 05:30.414
Like a potato?
Or a battery?

05:30.540 --> 05:32.667
Plus, no matter how much
energy they produced,

05:32.750 --> 05:35.169
it would take more energy
than that to keep them alive.

05:35.419 --> 05:37.964
I know, I know.
It sounds absurd.

05:38.089 --> 05:40.675
In fact, when The
<i>Matrix</i> first came out,

05:40.758 --> 05:42.760
it seemed like
the single crummiest,

05:42.885 --> 05:44.887
laziest, most awful,
dimwitted idea

05:45.012 --> 05:48.766
in the entire history of science
fiction, but it turned out to be true.

05:48.975 --> 05:50.101
Who knew?

05:50.268 --> 05:51.394
Good <i>work, writer of The Matrix.</i>

05:52.979 --> 05:55.189
FRY: This is it,
room 1119.

05:55.731 --> 05:57.900
Aw! It's my relatives.

05:58.109 --> 06:00.528
I'm gonna call them
Gram-gram and Shabba-doo.

06:00.611 --> 06:04.615
Theylookjust like you, Fry.
Arms, legs, ugly.

06:04.699 --> 06:07.743
Too bad we can't visit them
in their virtual world.

06:07.869 --> 06:09.704
We can.
Just moisten your heads

06:09.787 --> 06:12.415
and put on these
real-to-virtual adapter caps.

06:15.585 --> 06:19.881
Hmm, electricity plus
hats with wires on them.

06:19.964 --> 06:21.382
Are you sure
this is safe?

06:21.465 --> 06:24.135
It's not just safe,
it's 40% safe.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.722
(SCREAMING)

06:36.522 --> 06:39.025
Bender is falling!

06:40.109 --> 06:41.110
Whoa!

06:51.037 --> 06:52.496
Told you it was safe.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.838
So this is my relatives'
virtual old-folks home?

07:10.765 --> 07:15.019
There's only one word for it.
Terrible. And also horrible.

07:15.561 --> 07:19.065
This is their room. They're
gonna be so excited to meet me.

07:22.026 --> 07:23.861
Hi. I'm your
distant relative.

07:23.945 --> 07:28.616
Forget it, you flimflammer. I
can smell a scam a mile away.

07:31.202 --> 07:34.956
Reverse mortgages. Get your
reverse mortgages here.

07:35.039 --> 07:37.416
Come in, come in.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.420
So you're really
my grandson, huh?

07:41.504 --> 07:43.381
Well, it's not
quite that simple.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.424
See, I got frozen,
and your son,

07:45.508 --> 07:48.636
Professor Farnsworth, is my
great-great-great- great-great-great...

07:48.719 --> 07:50.805
Eh?
What?

07:50.888 --> 07:53.140
Yep, I'm your
grandson all right.

07:53.224 --> 07:56.060
A grandson?
My, you're a big boy.

07:56.394 --> 07:58.938
What are you,
a junior in high school?

07:59.021 --> 08:00.314
Most recently, yes.

08:00.398 --> 08:02.149
Oh, you look so thin.

08:02.233 --> 08:05.361
Can I offer you some
virtual ham casserole?

08:05.444 --> 08:07.697
Sounds delicious.

08:08.239 --> 08:09.740
Mmm.

08:10.032 --> 08:13.995
Oh, nobody's eaten my
food like that in ages.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.123
I don't cook much since
we moved out of reality.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.213
(SNORING)

08:25.923 --> 08:28.009
And that's how I got
this scar above my eye.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.136
And this fork
inside my lung.

08:30.678 --> 08:35.725
That's a doozy. Hey, look at this.
I can pull my thumb off.

08:35.850 --> 08:38.309
Stop, Shabba-doo,
you're freaking me out.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.604
Don't let him
getyournose.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.063
(ALL LAUGHING)

08:43.607 --> 08:45.401
Oh, Lord.

08:46.277 --> 08:49.697
It's so nice to have more family.
All I had was the Professor,

08:49.780 --> 08:51.699
and he's kind of
crotchety and moldy.

08:51.949 --> 08:54.035
You should have seen him
when he was little.

08:54.118 --> 08:57.163
My golly, he was
crotchety and moldy.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.665
We miss him terribly,
but it sure has

08:59.790 --> 09:02.209
been nice spending
time with you.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.712
It gets lonely and
depressing around here,

09:04.795 --> 09:06.714
with no entertainment
exceptthe

09:10.384 --> 09:13.137
Well, we should get going. It
was great to meet you, though,

09:13.220 --> 09:16.515
and hear about how bursitis
transcends physical existence.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.477
Keep up with
your studies, huh?

09:20.061 --> 09:22.480
What? Oh, God,
I'm still here?

09:24.148 --> 09:26.567

09:30.780 --> 09:34.992
I don't think Gram-gram likes that place.
And I know Shabba-don't.

I sure wish they

The batteries are dead.

09:55.179 --> 09:57.723
Oh, I'm about to lose
history's greatest life

09:57.848 --> 10:00.434
all because of some
useless old people.

10:00.518 --> 10:03.729
They're not useless.
They can cook ham casserole,

10:04.021 --> 10:08.109
and watch TV at incredible volume,
and they generate electricity.

10:08.192 --> 10:09.193
(GASPS) That's it!

10:13.280 --> 10:14.281
(ENGINE STARTS)

10:25.084 --> 10:27.753
We can cut them off.
Turn left at Miriam Feinberg.

10:29.547 --> 10:30.548
I meant Feingold!

10:42.893 --> 10:45.729
It's so nice to meet
the Professor's parents.

10:45.938 --> 10:49.108
I'm Dr. Zoidberg.
I'm very important.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.944
Hey, Zoidberg, you forgot
to empty this trash can.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.404
Don't hit me!

10:54.363 --> 10:57.324
I bet the Professor will be
thrilled to see you again.

10:57.449 --> 11:00.995
Oh, Professor. Some special
old people are here for you.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.622
Are they my zombies from
Hammacher Schlemmer?

11:03.706 --> 11:04.707

Hey, kiddo!

11:09.545 --> 11:13.632
Leave me alone! I never
want to see you again!

11:15.092 --> 11:16.844
What crawled up
his Geritol?

11:16.927 --> 11:18.971
Well, to be honest,

11:19.054 --> 11:21.932
a few troubling things
did happen in our past.

11:22.141 --> 11:25.227
Lady, all of human history
happened in your past!

11:25.311 --> 11:26.604

11:26.854 --> 11:30.691
Ah, let's not let those
dark days ruin our visit.

11:30.774 --> 11:34.236
Philip, what do you say we
go out today and live it up?

11:34.361 --> 11:37.531
"Live it up"? I'll be
surprised if you live it out!

11:37.656 --> 11:40.701
(LAUGHS) VVhoo! You're on fire!

12:20.824 --> 12:23.285
Whoa! Looks like
you guys had fun.

12:23.494 --> 12:25.621
Did we ever!
Gram-gram fell down at the

12:25.746 --> 12:27.873

we got free ice cream!

Aw, what's wrong?

13:10.124 --> 13:14.336
I just want my parents to love me.
God, how I hate them!

13:14.420 --> 13:16.130
Of course they love you!

13:16.213 --> 13:19.717
Not like they love Fry! They
never played with me like that.

13:19.883 --> 13:23.637
They were always "too tired."
Oh, what awful parents!

13:23.846 --> 13:26.807
Come closer. I'll tell
you the whole story.

13:27.224 --> 13:30.019
Tell you what. Let's get an
opaque bubble layer going.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.398
Okay, go.

13:34.732 --> 13:37.651
It all started
a century and a half ago.

13:39.028 --> 13:42.364
<i>I had a perfectly normal
adolescence in New New York.</i>

13:42.531 --> 13:45.117
<i>But my parents were simple
hedge fund managers</i>

13:45.200 --> 13:47.995
<i>who couldn't appreciate
my interest in science.</i>

13:48.245 --> 13:50.748
Mom, Dad,
look what I made!

13:51.040 --> 13:54.084
(YAWNING)
That's wonderful, dear.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.920
Here you go, Squeakers.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.800
<i>I was accepted to
MIT at the age of 14,</i>

14:01.884 --> 14:05.804
<i>but my parents crushed my dreams
like a discarded frog head.</i>

14:06.138 --> 14:08.849
Honey, I'm afraid
we can't let you go.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.186
You're just not emotionally
mature enough for college yet.

<i>with an unhealthy
respect for education,</i>

Oh, God, I hated that place. My
parents kept me there for years.

14:43.217 --> 14:48.097
So when I finally ran away, I vowed
never to speak to them again!

14:48.180 --> 14:51.475
That's a really sad and
long story, Professor.

you go to your parents now

honestly how you feel.

You're right. I will.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.927
I almost headed off the
Professor at the East River,

15:27.010 --> 15:28.429
but the wind
caught his skin flaps

15:28.512 --> 15:31.098
and sent him parasailing
over the Queensboro Bridge.

15:31.223 --> 15:33.976
Why would he go to Queens?
He doesn't need tires.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.854
Our old farm was in Queens.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.690
He must've gone back there to
defile it with his nudity!

Come on, hurry!

15:45.904 --> 15:48.407
Why are you so eager to
find the Professor, Fry?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.783
Aren't you mad at him?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.244
Of course I'm mad.
That's been established.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.205
I just want to find him for
Gram-gram and Shabba-dods sake.

15:55.789 --> 15:56.790

There's the old place.

Yes, everyone
look at the freak.

16:30.115 --> 16:33.327
His parents didn't love
him, so they kept him here,
