00:34.378 --> 00:36.137
[ shrieking]

00:36.206 --> 00:39.310
Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle.

00:39.378 --> 00:43.862
I put you through college,
and this is how you repay me?

00:45.930 --> 00:48.344
PROFESSOR:
Let's get this gargoyle hunt
on the road.

00:48.412 --> 00:52.862
Driving gloves, driving goggles,
driving thong. There.

00:52.930 --> 00:54.965
Uh, maybe I should drive.

00:55.033 --> 00:55.965
[ laughing]

00:56.033 --> 00:57.310
You? A woman?

00:57.378 --> 00:58.965
I'm trying to catch
a monster

00:59.033 --> 01:01.378
not find the quickest route
to the mall!

01:02.481 --> 01:04.137
Let me just adjust
the seat...

01:04.206 --> 01:06.688
[ screeching, thuds]

01:06.757 --> 01:08.688
[ grunting, gears grinding]

01:08.757 --> 01:09.965
Whoa!
Oh...!

01:10.034 --> 01:11.481
My God, he's going to do it.

01:11.551 --> 01:14.034
Everyone, seat belts
to maximum buckling!

01:14.102 --> 01:15.102
[ beeping]

01:29.448 --> 01:33.551
[ clicking]

01:33.620 --> 01:35.240
PROFESSOR:
Pazuzu!

01:35.310 --> 01:36.896
[ horns honking]

01:36.965 --> 01:40.103
Oh, Pazuzu...![ honking continues]

01:40.171 --> 01:43.585
Hey, grandpa,
move your wrinkly old keister!

01:45.103 --> 01:46.448
Shut up!

01:46.516 --> 01:48.343
For Heaven's Gate, Professor

01:48.412 --> 01:50.516
this ship can do
99% light speed.

01:50.585 --> 01:52.723
Why are we going 35 miles
an hour?

01:52.793 --> 01:55.000
Because we're in a hurry,
that's why!

01:55.067 --> 01:57.171
Plus, you have
the high beams on.

01:58.896 --> 02:02.000
PROFESSOR:
I can't quite read the sign.

02:04.826 --> 02:06.757
[ explosion]

02:06.826 --> 02:09.137
Pazuzu!

02:09.205 --> 02:12.481
Pazu... zu!

02:22.378 --> 02:24.103
Yo, Captain Cataracts.

02:24.171 --> 02:25.896
What are we
doing here?

02:25.965 --> 02:27.171
Oh, it's 2:30.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.205
We can still catch
the early bird dinner special.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.655
Uh, aren't we looking
for your gargoyle?

02:32.723 --> 02:34.861
My wha...?

02:34.930 --> 02:36.137
Hello, Mavis.

02:36.206 --> 02:39.620
Surprised to see me
back again so soon?

02:39.688 --> 02:40.861
Mavis is dead.

02:40.930 --> 02:42.655
I expect you'll want to see

02:42.723 --> 02:45.378
my Angry, Crotchety
Grandpa Discount Card.

02:45.448 --> 02:47.793
Sir, this card is expired.

02:47.861 --> 02:49.826
But it's good for a lifetime.

02:49.896 --> 02:51.481
Well, yours expired.

02:53.448 --> 02:54.826
Oh, Lord.

02:54.896 --> 02:57.723
Teeth do not belong
in your pants, Professor.

02:57.793 --> 02:59.688
Well, I can't keep
them in my mouth.

02:59.758 --> 03:01.205
They're nuclear-powered!

03:01.275 --> 03:04.413
[ clacking]

03:05.586 --> 03:07.033
Ow!
It bit my finger!

03:07.103 --> 03:09.550
No! No!
It's tasted
human blood.

03:09.620 --> 03:11.723
[ people screaming]

03:13.205 --> 03:14.861
[ slurping]

03:14.931 --> 03:15.861
Mmm...

03:15.931 --> 03:17.793
Damn good meat.

03:20.378 --> 03:22.758
[ snoring][ door opening]

03:22.826 --> 03:24.516
[ gasping, moaning]

03:24.586 --> 03:26.240
Professor, we've talked it over

03:26.310 --> 03:28.103
and everybody thinks
you're too old.

03:28.171 --> 03:29.137
Uh-huh.
Right on.
Yep.

03:29.205 --> 03:31.137
We've decided to do
the merciful thing

03:31.205 --> 03:32.481
and have you youth-a-sized.

03:32.550 --> 03:34.378
Dear God, no!

03:34.448 --> 03:35.723
Oh, relax, Professor.

03:35.793 --> 03:38.448
Youth-a-sizing
is a trendy new spa treatment.

03:38.516 --> 03:40.826
It's this season's
shark cartilage enema.

03:40.896 --> 03:42.343
But I like being old.

03:42.413 --> 03:44.620
I don't have to talk
to my parents

03:44.688 --> 03:47.240
no one asks me to help
move their stuff

03:47.310 --> 03:50.723
I don't need to understand
today's edgy TV sitcoms...

03:50.793 --> 03:52.655
Okay, okay.
We're not going to force you

03:52.723 --> 03:54.033
until I finish this sentence.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.240
Get him!

03:55.310 --> 03:57.378
[ moaning]

03:57.448 --> 03:59.481
Oh... my thong!

04:09.965 --> 04:11.068
Hi.

04:11.137 --> 04:13.240
I'm Heather,
your personal youth-a-sizer.

04:13.310 --> 04:16.379
Let's get started with a nice
botulism treatment, shall we?

04:16.447 --> 04:17.757
Go to hell, Heather!

04:17.826 --> 04:19.586
Oh... [ giggling]

04:19.654 --> 04:22.033
In small doses, botulism toxin

04:22.103 --> 04:25.000
tightens and tones
the facial muscles

04:25.067 --> 04:26.274
instead of killing you

04:26.343 --> 04:28.413
in the most horrible fashion
imaginable.

04:30.689 --> 04:32.447
[ squeaking]

04:32.516 --> 04:35.240
[ stiff-lipped]:
Give me back my floppy face.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.620
Oh! Whoo! Ooh!

04:37.689 --> 04:39.172
Careful with
the giblets!

04:39.240 --> 04:41.310
Mmm, your still
retaining a lot
of grump

04:41.379 --> 04:42.447
in these joints.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.689
More pressure.

04:46.033 --> 04:48.137
Aah...

04:48.206 --> 04:50.413
[ whirring sound]

04:50.481 --> 04:52.896
Since this is such
a serious case of old

04:52.965 --> 04:55.413
we'll have to try our
strongest treatment--

04:55.481 --> 04:56.965
a soothing,
full-body bath

04:57.033 --> 04:58.481
in searing hot tar.

04:58.550 --> 05:00.067
[ bubbling]

05:00.137 --> 05:03.964
Sir, it's not necessary,
or wise, to be naked.

05:04.033 --> 05:07.862
[ sputtering]:
You sound just like
my tennis instructor.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.103
[ bubbling]

05:11.172 --> 05:13.964
The tar blisters
the age right out
of the body

05:14.033 --> 05:16.689
in what top scientists
suspect is a miracle.

05:16.757 --> 05:18.033
[ squeaking]

05:18.103 --> 05:19.620
[ bubbling increases]

05:19.689 --> 05:21.206
Oh, I don't have time for this!

05:21.274 --> 05:23.862
I have to go buy a single piece
of fruit with a coupon

05:23.930 --> 05:25.240
and then return it

05:25.310 --> 05:28.033
making people wait behind me
while I complain!

05:28.103 --> 05:29.826
He still sounds
sort of old.

05:29.896 --> 05:30.896
Sort of real old.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.033
Step aside, lady.

05:33.103 --> 05:34.793
Like everything else in life

05:34.862 --> 05:38.206
pumping is just a primitive,
degenerate form of bending.

05:38.274 --> 05:39.516
[ grunting]

05:39.586 --> 05:42.206
[ bubbling]Whoa! Whoo!

05:42.274 --> 05:43.620
Oh! Whoa!

05:43.689 --> 05:45.137
[ lever squeaking]

05:45.206 --> 05:48.067
Come on, Bender, pump harder!
Harder!

05:48.137 --> 05:50.206
[ weakly]:
I'm trying as hard as I can.

05:50.274 --> 05:51.689
Harder, damn you!

05:51.757 --> 05:53.206
[ bubbling]

05:53.274 --> 05:55.516
[ rumbling]

05:55.586 --> 05:57.379
[ rumbling intensifies]

06:03.620 --> 06:04.413
[ yelling stops]

06:07.516 --> 06:11.896
[ coughing, gasping]

06:14.343 --> 06:16.964
Well, that was an utter waste
of time.

06:17.033 --> 06:18.516
[ gasping]

06:18.586 --> 06:20.516
Professor, it worked!

06:20.586 --> 06:22.757
You look young enough
to be my father.

06:22.826 --> 06:24.000
Poodle spit!

06:24.067 --> 06:25.137
[ whirring sound]

06:26.447 --> 06:28.516
[ gasps]:
53 years old?

06:28.586 --> 06:29.862
[ groans]

06:29.930 --> 06:31.862
Now I'll need a fake I.D.
to rent ultraporn.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.516
FRY:
This is cool,
Professor.

06:33.586 --> 06:36.516
[ voice cracking]:
We should go out
and celebrate.

06:36.586 --> 06:37.586
Huh?
What?

06:43.103 --> 06:48.343
Dear Lord, you've all reverted
to your childhood forms.

06:48.413 --> 06:52.757
Hooray, I'm a teenage heartthrob
again!

06:57.896 --> 07:00.103
While I try to restore
our normal ages

07:00.172 --> 07:02.550
I expect you all
to go about your jobs

07:02.620 --> 07:04.757
like responsible professionals.

07:04.826 --> 07:06.033
[ kids laughing]

07:07.654 --> 07:09.000
It wasn't me, Mr. F.

07:09.067 --> 07:10.172
It was Amy.

07:11.033 --> 07:12.862
Stop it, Amy.
You stink!

07:12.930 --> 07:14.481
[ grunting]You know you did it.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.413
[ all yelling at once]

07:16.481 --> 07:19.000
Quiet! Quiet, I say!

07:21.930 --> 07:23.343
We're here to take
my little stub

07:23.413 --> 07:24.896
of a husband home.

07:24.964 --> 07:28.206
Hermes, say good-bye
to Mr. Farnsworth.

07:28.274 --> 07:30.310
Good-bye, Mr. Dumbsworth.

07:30.379 --> 07:31.896
[ snickering]

07:31.964 --> 07:33.310
Hey, this is my chance

07:33.379 --> 07:35.481
to spend time
with myparents, too.

07:35.550 --> 07:37.965
But your parents
are gross sewer
mutants.

07:38.033 --> 07:39.000
Ow!

07:39.067 --> 07:41.103
[ laughing mischievously]

07:41.172 --> 07:43.206
When I was an orphan,
I always wished

07:43.274 --> 07:45.240
I could grow up
with my mom and dad.

07:45.310 --> 07:48.240
And now, thanks to being hurled
backwards in time...

07:48.310 --> 07:49.586
That's not what happened!

07:49.654 --> 07:51.620
Shut up and go live
with your parents!

07:54.654 --> 07:55.654
[ beeping]

08:03.413 --> 08:07.550
LEELA:
It's going to be
totally awesome, Mom.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.033
You and me can bake

08:09.103 --> 08:11.343
and argue
about my hairstyle
hiding my pretty face.

08:11.413 --> 08:13.206
And if some kid
picks on me

08:13.274 --> 08:15.033
my dad can beat up
his dad!

08:15.103 --> 08:17.000
Can't I just beat up the kid?

08:17.067 --> 08:18.343
[ chuckling]

08:18.413 --> 08:21.033
Well, okay, Leela.

08:21.103 --> 08:23.000
If you think you can put up
with your father

08:23.067 --> 08:24.206
then welcome home.

08:24.274 --> 08:26.310
We'll try to respect
your independence

08:26.379 --> 08:27.550
and freedom...
No!

08:27.620 --> 08:30.206
I want the real teen experience.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.413
Chores, curfew, the works!

08:32.481 --> 08:33.965
Fine, sweetiekins.

08:34.033 --> 08:36.102
We'll be the strictest parents
ever.

08:36.172 --> 08:38.895
Now, let's all have some tequila
to celebrate.

08:38.965 --> 08:41.000
Dad! I'm underage!

08:41.067 --> 08:42.136
Oh, right.

08:42.206 --> 08:43.586
Here's a Silly Straw.

08:46.551 --> 08:48.517
[ sniffling]

08:48.586 --> 08:51.931
[ with accent]:
Oh, my Amy
is sweet little girl again.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.758
This like
a mother's dream.

08:53.826 --> 08:55.447
Bad dream, that is.

08:55.517 --> 08:58.861
At this rate, I'm
never going to get
a grandchild! Agh!

08:58.931 --> 09:01.274
Maybe she not grown up,
but she sure grown out.

09:01.344 --> 09:02.895
She fat.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.931
Dad, if you're going to make
fat jokes till I get cute again

09:06.000 --> 09:07.620
I'm just going to stay
in my room.

09:07.688 --> 09:09.000
Stay in room?

09:09.067 --> 09:10.826
You so fat, you going to stay
all around room.

09:10.895 --> 09:11.895
[ laughing]

09:15.965 --> 09:19.481
I've got to find a way
to escape the horrible
ravages of youth.

09:19.551 --> 09:22.000
Suddenly, I'm going to the
bathroom like clockwork

09:22.067 --> 09:23.344
every three hours.

09:23.413 --> 09:25.758
And those jerks
at Social Security

09:25.826 --> 09:27.758
stopped sending me checks.

09:27.826 --> 09:29.481
Now Ihave to pay them!

09:29.551 --> 09:31.136
I'm tired
of your yapping!

09:31.206 --> 09:32.826
[ tires screeching]

09:32.895 --> 09:34.965
[ glass shattering,
loud crashing]

09:35.033 --> 09:36.724
All you ever do
is complain.

09:36.793 --> 09:39.033
You never try
to make things better.

09:39.102 --> 09:42.379
Well, I'm running away
from this dead-end family.

09:42.447 --> 09:46.413
I know there's a place for
people like me, with new ideas.

09:46.481 --> 09:47.551
There has to be!

09:47.620 --> 09:48.931
Fine. Get going.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.136
Oh, I'm going.

09:50.206 --> 09:52.309
And you're going to be all,
"Where's Bender?

09:52.379 --> 09:53.654
I miss Bender."

09:53.724 --> 09:55.688
We won't know that
until you leave.

09:55.758 --> 09:57.240
Oh, I'm leaving.

09:57.309 --> 09:58.517
There's
the door.

09:58.586 --> 10:00.274
[ engine sputtering]

10:00.344 --> 10:02.551
[ engine dies]I'll be good.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.620
[ groans]

10:06.688 --> 10:08.724
Do you have to shed
your skin on the couch?

10:08.793 --> 10:10.102
What do we live in, a zoo?

10:10.172 --> 10:11.654
[ doorbell chiming]

10:11.724 --> 10:12.965
I'm getting the doorbell.

10:13.861 --> 10:15.102
For me?

10:15.172 --> 10:16.688
[ chuckling]

10:16.758 --> 10:17.965
Oh, hello, sir.

10:18.033 --> 10:20.136
It's a lovely evening
you have tonight.

10:20.206 --> 10:22.620
[ voice cracking]:
Um, I'm here to pick up
your daughter.

10:22.688 --> 10:23.931
Hi, Fry.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.447
I like your blazer.

10:25.517 --> 10:28.413
Thanks. These
aren't pockets,
they're just flaps.

10:28.481 --> 10:30.620
I put my money
in my sock.

10:30.688 --> 10:32.620
[ laughing nervously]

10:32.688 --> 10:35.000
So, where are you taking my
daughter tonight?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.413
[ voice cracking]:
A movie.

10:36.481 --> 10:39.172
[ clears throat]:
A-A movie, ma'am.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.895
Well, whatever
you're really doing

10:40.965 --> 10:42.965
don't wake us if you
get in after 12:00.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.586
Dad! You're being
too lenient again.

10:45.654 --> 10:47.551
I have to be
back by 11:00.

10:47.620 --> 10:48.517
Okay. Okay.

10:48.586 --> 10:50.033
You're the boss.

10:50.102 --> 10:51.620
No, I'm not!

10:56.688 --> 10:59.206
I'd like a sewer burger,
but without the rat feces.

10:59.274 --> 11:00.654
What, are you on a diet?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.688
Duh, Leela,
you look hot.

11:04.758 --> 11:06.517
Geez, Moose,
just dump me

11:06.586 --> 11:09.274
right in front
of her, why don't you?

11:09.344 --> 11:12.447
Moose, Mandy, this
is my friend Fry...

11:12.517 --> 11:13.965
from the surface?

11:14.033 --> 11:15.724
Oh, so this is
the famous Fry.

11:15.793 --> 11:18.688
What is he, like, the biggest
loser on the surface

11:18.758 --> 11:20.826
so he has to hang
out in the sewer?

11:20.895 --> 11:23.033
[ whispers]:
They're on to me.Hey, come on.

11:23.102 --> 11:25.895
Let's act like
grown-ups here.
Want to race?

11:25.965 --> 11:27.620

Huh!

11:47.000 --> 11:48.447
Theres.

11:48.517 --> 11:52.447
The world's drinkings water

We'll never catch them!

12:11.895 --> 12:13.136
Yes, we will!

12:13.206 --> 12:15.309
This sewer goes right
under Planet Express

12:15.379 --> 12:16.481
and it's 9:00 p.m.!

this predictable colon!

[ voice cracks]:
Leela, you can stop
winning now. We won.

12:36.861 --> 12:38.654
I'm too short
to reach the hand brake!

12:38.724 --> 12:40.136
[ screaming]

12:42.309 --> 12:44.620
That's detention.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.688
And then, and then
a giant tapeworm

12:48.758 --> 12:50.102
tried to play us for chumps!

12:50.172 --> 12:52.000
But we, like,
totally dissed Moose.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.688
Yes, I'd like to meet
this "Moose."

12:54.758 --> 12:57.551
But in the meantime,
I have good news.

12:57.620 --> 13:00.172
I may have solved
our age problem.

13:00.240 --> 13:01.379
[ voice cracking]:
Yay!

13:01.447 --> 13:02.758
[ beeping]

13:02.826 --> 13:05.826
It seems the youth-a-sizing
tar was saturated

13:05.895 --> 13:07.793
with time-altering chronitons.

13:07.861 --> 13:10.724
A thin layer is still
stuck to our DNA

13:10.793 --> 13:14.379
as well as Bender's
"Robo," or "RNA."

13:14.447 --> 13:15.000
Question?

13:15.067 --> 13:15.861
Yes?

13:15.931 --> 13:16.861
You stink.

13:16.931 --> 13:17.826
[ giggles]

13:17.895 --> 13:19.136
Yes, yes.

13:19.206 --> 13:22.102
Anyhow, I've designed
an oil-eating bacterium

13:22.172 --> 13:24.654
that should take
the tar right off.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.240
Come on, let's go
tell Leela

13:26.309 --> 13:27.517
so we can grow
up together.

13:27.586 --> 13:29.481

13:29.551 --> 13:31.344
LEELA:
Thanks, Professor

13:31.413 --> 13:33.413
but I don't want
the treatment.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.793
Don't you understand,
you little nitwit?

13:35.861 --> 13:38.206
Unless you're treated soon,
the only way

13:38.274 --> 13:41.379
to restore your true age
will be to grow into it...

13:41.447 --> 13:43.654
just as God intended!

13:43.724 --> 13:45.000
He has a point,
honey.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.447
What about your job
and your friends?

13:47.517 --> 13:50.379
Do you really want to
abandon your old life?

13:50.447 --> 13:52.206
My old life
wasn't as glamorous

13:52.274 --> 13:53.931
as my web-page
made it look.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.136
All I ever wanted
was to grow up here,with you.

13:57.206 --> 13:58.344
Please?

13:58.413 --> 14:01.586
Well, if it's what
you really want...

14:01.654 --> 14:03.481
It is. I know it is.

14:05.861 --> 14:08.206
[ voice cracking]:
I'll miss you, Leela.

14:08.274 --> 14:11.067
I'll come back and visit
when I'm all grown up.

14:11.136 --> 14:12.586

No beer till you finish
your tequila.

The age-restoring microbes

I'm no doctor, but this machine
guy could use a lozenge.

14:45.826 --> 14:46.965
[ tiny voice]:
Aw, poo.

We're even younger.

14:50.274 --> 14:53.724
[ beeping]

14:53.793 --> 14:56.274
Damn! The bacteria pigged out
on the tar

14:56.344 --> 14:58.826
and now they're getting
freaky-deaky...

14:58.895 --> 15:01.309

throughout our systems.

15:01.379 --> 15:03.379
We're getting younger
by the minute!

15:03.447 --> 15:05.067
No!Yikes!

15:05.136 --> 15:07.551
What, I'm going to revert
through allmy larval stages?

15:09.172 --> 15:12.688
Word. We'll all keep getting
younger and younger

15:12.758 --> 15:15.517
until we suffer a fate
worse than death...

15:15.586 --> 15:16.965

shrivel up

agony of unbirth!

Think, you disco
duck, think!

What's that squirmle
under your shirt?

down here, I can't.

16:17.586 --> 16:18.895
There.

16:18.965 --> 16:22.067
Today's story
is from Muteenmagazine.

Who would you rather hear
about-- four-legged Chachi

Hmm... it is
just a legend.

Still, they called
the Tooth Fairy a legend

and my brother Norman
split off

19:07.758 --> 19:09.275
and jumped in the fountain.

19:09.344 --> 19:12.413
He always had to
be the center
of attention!

to be a kid again sometimes
