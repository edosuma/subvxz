00:28.215 --> 00:29.812
No.

00:36.816 --> 00:38.336
No.

00:42.328 --> 00:46.958
NO!

01:11.257 --> 01:15.210
<font color=#FF00FF>*DOCTOR WHO*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 10 Episode 11</font>
Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"World Enough and Time"</font>

02:42.442 --> 02:45.722
Hello! I'm Doctor Who!

02:48.338 --> 02:53.745
And these are my plucky assistants.
Thing One and the Other One.

02:53.808 --> 02:55.355
Bill. Nardole.

02:55.465 --> 02:59.745
We picked up your distress call
and here we are to help,

02:59.839 --> 03:01.636
like awesome heroes!

03:01.894 --> 03:03.363
Yeah, we're not...
we're not assistants.

03:03.410 --> 03:07.065
OK, right, so what does he call you?
Companions? Pets?

03:07.482 --> 03:08.721
Snacks?

03:09.966 --> 03:13.042
Oh, someone's watching!

03:13.762 --> 03:17.572
Well, that's quite a good beat,
really, isn't it?

03:17.620 --> 03:19.004
Maybe we should be moving on.

03:19.104 --> 03:20.308
Yeah, and he calls us friends.

03:20.356 --> 03:23.542
Ew, Doctor! Think of the age gap!

03:23.590 --> 03:25.310
Stop mucking about and
concentrate.

03:25.404 --> 03:27.502
Nardole,
do something non-irritating.

03:27.597 --> 03:28.675
On it, sir!

03:28.729 --> 03:30.580
Time Lords are friends
with each other,

03:30.628 --> 03:32.862
dear, everything else is
cradle-snatching.

03:32.972 --> 03:34.491
Oh, it's a big one.

03:34.697 --> 03:38.637
Ship reads as 400 miles long,
and 100 miles wide.

03:38.819 --> 03:41.520
Big, even for a colony ship.
Anything else?

03:41.740 --> 03:42.996
Er...

03:47.353 --> 03:48.832
Oh, look at that.

03:48.964 --> 03:52.098
Finally!
It's like supporting plants grow.

03:52.970 --> 03:54.504
It's heading towards a black hole.

03:54.552 --> 03:56.027
- No...
- No, it isn't.

03:56.129 --> 03:59.153
It was heading towards a black
hole, until somebody noticed.

03:59.325 --> 04:01.543
Now they're trying to
reverse away from it.

04:01.629 --> 04:03.965
Engines are on reverse thrust, see?

04:04.113 --> 04:06.019
Um, Oh.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.082
It's succeeding. Um.

04:07.131 --> 04:09.170
Very, very slowly.

04:09.234 --> 04:11.231
Explains the distress call, I guess.

04:11.570 --> 04:14.059
So, a 400-mile ship,

04:14.188 --> 04:19.801
reversing away from the
gravitational pull of a black hole.

04:20.149 --> 04:21.457
Are we having fun yet?

04:21.533 --> 04:22.668
Mm.

04:23.502 --> 04:28.135
Hello? Who's there, hello?
Please report status.

04:28.183 --> 04:32.275
Oh, hello, what have we got here?!

04:33.305 --> 04:35.408
You're probably handsome,
aren't you?

04:35.487 --> 04:38.103
Congratulations on your
relative symmetry.

04:38.216 --> 04:39.255
Who are you?

04:39.327 --> 04:43.385
Well, I am that mysterious
adventurer in all of time and

04:43.488 --> 04:46.752
space, known only as Doctor Who,

04:46.827 --> 04:51.946
and these are my disposables -
Exposition and... Comic Relief.

04:51.994 --> 04:53.580
We're not functions!

04:53.698 --> 04:55.375
Darling, those were genders.

04:55.470 --> 04:58.109
Please stay exactly where you are
for your own safety.

04:58.212 --> 05:00.352
He likes me, so exciting!

05:00.446 --> 05:01.845
I'm coming through.

05:02.273 --> 05:05.820
Hurry, my stallion,
and if I'm in the shower,

05:05.906 --> 05:07.414
just bring me some beans on toast.

05:07.462 --> 05:10.742
That's... That's roughly human
flirting, isn't it?

05:10.790 --> 05:13.188
So, why do you keep calling
yourself Doctor Who?

05:13.248 --> 05:15.328
Because I'm pretending to be him,

05:15.383 --> 05:19.453
because that's the whole point of
this ridiculous exercise.

05:19.612 --> 05:22.008
It's not an exercise, it's a test.

05:22.617 --> 05:24.734
- Are you eating?
- No.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.797
Yeah, well, don't test me,
eating crisps!

05:27.939 --> 05:30.875
But he's called the Doctor, so...

05:31.023 --> 05:34.231
He says, "I'm the Doctor",
and they say, "Doctor who?"

05:34.341 --> 05:37.102
See, I'm cutting to the chase,
baby! I'm streamlining.

05:37.150 --> 05:40.421
I'm saving us actual minutes.

05:40.728 --> 05:42.210
Yeah, OK, whatever.

05:42.268 --> 05:43.387
Also, it's his real name.

05:43.465 --> 05:44.859
It's what?

05:45.001 --> 05:46.468
Look at the screens!

05:46.625 --> 05:47.960
Slow today, Missy.

05:48.068 --> 05:50.500
All those screens have been angled
to a single viewpoint.

05:50.561 --> 05:52.539
But not originally,
they've all been moved.

05:52.587 --> 05:53.626
Which means?

05:53.674 --> 05:56.328
Giant ship, single pilot,
but not designed that way,

05:56.376 --> 05:57.795
something's happened to the others.

05:57.843 --> 06:02.318
Yes. And now it's time for you to
figure out what.

06:06.122 --> 06:08.544
Uh-oh! Someone else has noticed us.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.759
Sorry, what do you mean,
it's his real name?

06:10.822 --> 06:12.575
Nobody knows the Doctor's real name.

06:12.689 --> 06:17.911
I do, because I grew up with him,
and his real name is Doctor Who.

06:18.175 --> 06:20.755
Bill,
she's just trying to wind you up.

06:20.864 --> 06:23.630
Chose it himself, you know,
trying to sound mysterious.

06:23.730 --> 06:25.729
Then he dropped the Who when
he realised it was

06:25.785 --> 06:27.357
a tiny bit on the nose.

06:27.412 --> 06:29.161
Stop teasing her and focus.

06:29.232 --> 06:32.771
Is she serious, though, Doctor?
Is your real name Doctor Who?

06:35.932 --> 06:39.849
Oh, you're blue.
Nice, I should go back to blue.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.068
Stay where you are.

06:42.216 --> 06:44.552
Stay calm. He's very frightened.

06:44.812 --> 06:46.691
Deary me,
I thought you were handsome,

06:46.786 --> 06:49.857
and now you've gone all cross and
you're pointing a gun at me.

06:50.099 --> 06:53.122
Is this the emotion you humans
call... spanking?

06:53.193 --> 06:55.651
Are there only three of you?
Are any of you human?

06:55.699 --> 06:58.661
What's happened to this ship and
how long have you been here alone?

06:58.732 --> 06:59.966
You're looking very sickly.

07:00.052 --> 07:01.840
Two days. Are you human?

07:01.888 --> 07:03.966
Oh, don't be a bitch.
How did you get on board?

07:04.208 --> 07:05.442
Is that your capsule?

07:05.490 --> 07:06.740
- Yes.
- No.

07:06.829 --> 07:08.357
There, look!

07:11.190 --> 07:13.611
Three lifts. They're coming.

07:14.222 --> 07:15.519
What's in this ship?

07:15.615 --> 07:17.417
Super-fast inertia lifts.

07:17.839 --> 07:19.761
What's inside?
What's coming up here?

07:19.852 --> 07:22.362
Things. I don't even know
where they came from.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.851
One of you must be human.

07:23.916 --> 07:25.978
They only come up if they detect
human life signs.

07:26.050 --> 07:27.948
- What for?
- They take them away.

07:28.081 --> 07:30.862
So those are the lift doors, yeah?
That's where they come out.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.269
I'll be right with you.

07:32.396 --> 07:34.089
Which of you is human?

07:36.980 --> 07:38.737
Me. Me.

07:38.852 --> 07:42.284
I'm human.
I'm the only one, just... just me.

07:43.372 --> 07:46.980
Please stop this!
Stop right there, now!

07:47.167 --> 07:49.171
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

07:49.245 --> 07:51.042
But you're the reason that
they're coming.

07:51.165 --> 07:52.764
Put it down, put that down now!

07:52.812 --> 07:54.244
They won't come if she's dead.

07:54.292 --> 07:55.644
You don't need to do this.

07:55.769 --> 07:58.573
I can get her off this ship,
I can shield her life signs.

07:58.692 --> 08:02.531
You know what, Doctor?
I said this was a bad idea.

08:02.776 --> 08:05.308
Please. Listen to me. Look at me.

08:05.770 --> 08:07.690
Go on, look at me.

08:08.015 --> 08:12.143
That's good. That's very, very good.

08:13.093 --> 08:16.612
Now, do you see this mad woman
sitting in this chair?

08:16.776 --> 08:19.011
Her name isn't Doctor Who.

08:19.105 --> 08:20.698
My name is Doctor Who.

08:20.885 --> 08:22.081
It's not, is it?

08:22.221 --> 08:23.511
I like it.

08:23.686 --> 08:26.190
You don't know it yet,
but in a short time,

08:26.339 --> 08:28.081
you will trust me with your life.

08:28.214 --> 08:30.683
And when I save you,
and everyone on your ship,

08:30.955 --> 08:32.917
one day you will look back,

08:33.206 --> 08:35.650
and wonder who I was and why I....

08:35.732 --> 08:37.198
GUNSHOT

09:00.012 --> 09:01.526
Doctor, this is a bad idea.

09:01.590 --> 09:03.526
No, it's a good idea. A test run.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.931
She thinks she can be me.
Let's try her out.

09:06.019 --> 09:07.091
Why?

09:07.139 --> 09:08.683
She got us home from Mars.

09:08.834 --> 09:10.674
She's a murderer.

09:11.683 --> 09:13.731
Enjoying your bacon sandwich?

09:13.979 --> 09:15.157
Why?

09:15.252 --> 09:17.331
Because it had a mummy and a daddy.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.003
Go tell a pig about your
moral high ground.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.839
I pick a scenario, we drop her down
into it, and we see how she does.

09:25.714 --> 09:26.847
How does that work?

09:26.895 --> 09:32.542
Ah. We just take the TARDIS for a spin
and we graze for distress calls.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.175
We pick a good one.

09:34.317 --> 09:35.517
Our usual Saturday.

09:36.179 --> 09:39.550
And... what if she just walks out and
slaughters everyone

09:39.605 --> 09:40.690
just for a laugh?

09:40.741 --> 09:43.753
Well, I will be monitoring you
the whole time.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.779
Me? Yes, you and Nardole.
You can be her companions.

09:48.843 --> 09:53.589
Oh, nah! Forget it.
Absolutely no way.

09:53.877 --> 09:55.252
Nardole agreed.

09:55.557 --> 09:56.628
No, I didn't.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.543
You did in my head,
which is good enough for me.

09:58.590 --> 10:00.151
Why do you want to do this?

10:00.495 --> 10:02.971
She's my friend. She's my oldest
friend in the universe.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.164
You've got lots of friends.
Better ones.

10:05.292 --> 10:06.491
What's so special about her?

10:06.546 --> 10:08.815
- She's different.
- Different how?

10:09.606 --> 10:10.933
I don't know.

10:15.556 --> 10:16.836
Yes, you do.

10:21.526 --> 10:25.628
She's the only person that I've ever
met who's even remotely like me.

10:29.039 --> 10:32.323
So, more than anything,
you want her to be good?

10:41.412 --> 10:43.092
Are you having an emotion?

10:44.652 --> 10:46.048
I know I can help her.

10:46.337 --> 10:47.491
Yeah.

10:47.634 --> 10:49.571
Look at that face,
he's having an emotion!

10:49.712 --> 10:52.121
Yeah. Yes, look at that bit, yeah,
he's doing emotions.

10:52.230 --> 10:54.772
Oh, leave him alone!
Can I take a selfie with you?

10:57.173 --> 11:00.269
She was my first friend,
always so brilliant,

11:00.538 --> 11:02.551
from the first day at the Academy.

11:03.449 --> 11:05.364
So fast, so funny.

11:05.605 --> 11:06.949
She was my man crush.

11:07.059 --> 11:08.316
I'm sorry?

11:08.566 --> 11:11.411
Yeah, I think she was
a man back then.

11:11.519 --> 11:14.324
I'm fairly sure that I was, too,
it was a long time ago, though.

11:15.199 --> 11:20.931
So, Time Lords, bit flexible on the
whole man/woman thing, then, yeah?

11:21.511 --> 11:23.684
We are the most civilised
civilisation in the universe,

11:23.732 --> 11:27.379
we're billions of years beyond
your petty human obsession with

11:27.492 --> 11:30.011
gender and its associated
stereotypes.

11:30.238 --> 11:33.465
But you still call
yourselves Time Lords?

11:34.727 --> 11:36.286
Yeah, shut up.

11:36.632 --> 11:37.952
OK.

11:39.605 --> 11:42.543
We had a pact, me and him.

11:43.730 --> 11:48.840
Every star in the universe,
we were going to see them all.

11:50.472 --> 11:55.777
But he was too busy burning them.
I don't think she ever saw anything.

11:56.714 --> 11:59.499
And you think that if she did,
she'd change?

12:01.691 --> 12:04.199
I know she would. I know it.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.371
You're a bloody idiot.
You know that, yeah?

12:11.335 --> 12:12.695
Course.

12:18.128 --> 12:19.496
She scares me.

12:24.528 --> 12:27.372
Like, she really scares me.

12:33.612 --> 12:37.339
Ok. So promise me one thing, yeah?

12:38.153 --> 12:40.105
Promise you won't get me killed.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.511
I'm sorry.

12:47.355 --> 12:49.102
I can't promise you that.

12:49.871 --> 12:51.309
Thanks!

12:53.707 --> 12:59.121
I mean, look, you're human,
and humans are so mortal.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.270
Cheers!

13:00.361 --> 13:02.051
I mean, you pop like balloons.

13:08.348 --> 13:10.840
I mean, one heart.

13:11.465 --> 13:13.789
It's your most important
organ, and you've no back up.

13:13.837 --> 13:15.371
It's like a budget cut.

13:16.030 --> 13:18.035
You'll try and keep me alive?

13:20.074 --> 13:21.543
Within reason.

13:21.686 --> 13:23.012
Thanks, mate!

13:33.158 --> 13:34.488
What are they?

13:35.161 --> 13:36.652
What are those things?

13:39.426 --> 13:41.457
You're too late. She's dead.

13:42.090 --> 13:44.207
Don't you touch her. Don't
you lay a finger on her!

13:44.270 --> 13:48.980
Stand. Away. Stand. Away.

13:49.103 --> 13:52.371
She. Will. Be. Repaired.

13:52.434 --> 13:55.012
- Repaired?
- Stand. Away.

13:55.105 --> 13:57.294
You can help her?
Is that what you mean?

14:01.134 --> 14:02.810
Where are you going?
What are you going to do with her?

14:02.857 --> 14:03.926
Re-pair.

14:03.981 --> 14:05.872
Don't try and stop them.
They'll snap you in half.

14:05.919 --> 14:07.215
When do you bring her back?

14:07.263 --> 14:10.072
We. Will. Not.

14:14.515 --> 14:15.715
Wait for me.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.705
Wait for me.

14:18.845 --> 14:20.029
What are you doing?

14:20.088 --> 14:21.884
Leaving a message in her
subconscious.

14:21.932 --> 14:22.971
How? She's dead.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.339
Those things are going to repair her,
so clearly she isn't.

14:25.386 --> 14:26.830
- Assumption!
- Deduction!

14:26.910 --> 14:28.829
- Hope! Idiot!
- Faith! Always!

14:29.002 --> 14:30.987
Sir, step away from those doors.
You'll bring them back!

14:31.034 --> 14:33.713
What do you care, Smurf?
They're not even interested in you.

14:33.912 --> 14:37.438
Sir, I swear to you, step away
from that lift or I will kill you!

14:37.486 --> 14:38.953
Don't, you will only make me angry.

14:39.001 --> 14:40.408
- Honey, listen to him.
- Why?

14:40.470 --> 14:42.190
Because if somebody kills
you and it's not me,

14:42.237 --> 14:45.869
we'll both be disappointed. Now, you!
What were those things?

14:45.950 --> 14:47.852
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

14:47.900 --> 14:50.176
- They're on your ship!
- The ship is supposed to be empty.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.542
But it's a colony ship.

14:51.603 --> 14:52.681
But it's brand-new.

14:52.750 --> 14:55.487
The colonists haven't arrived yet,
we were on our way to pick them up.

14:55.534 --> 14:57.931
A skeleton crew... 50 of us, that's all.

14:58.127 --> 15:01.658
It's not empty now, is it?
Look, thousands of life readings.

15:01.790 --> 15:04.642
Two days ago there was nothing.
Those readings came out of nowhere.

15:04.705 --> 15:06.549
- Well, obviously you were boarded.
- No.

15:06.597 --> 15:08.580
Your ship was taken over,
it happens.

15:08.734 --> 15:10.572
- No.
- Doctor?

15:10.639 --> 15:14.009
This is worse than I thought.
Much worse!

15:14.713 --> 15:17.952
50 of you... taking your brand-new
ship, fresh from the factory,

15:18.007 --> 15:19.252
to pick up some colonists?

15:19.300 --> 15:20.304
Yes.

15:20.352 --> 15:22.749
Two days ago,
you almost bump into a black hole.

15:22.869 --> 15:24.119
What did you do then?

15:24.223 --> 15:25.916
We tried to reverse out of it.

15:26.156 --> 15:29.619
And you sent a team down to
the other end of the ship

15:29.681 --> 15:31.377
to reverse the rear thrusters, yes?

15:31.425 --> 15:33.464
- Yes
- How many people in the team?

15:33.627 --> 15:34.853
About 20.

15:34.986 --> 15:36.339
And you never heard from them
again.

15:36.386 --> 15:39.080
And then the whole ship just lit
up with all these new life-forms.

15:39.183 --> 15:40.302
- Correct?
- Exactly.

15:40.350 --> 15:41.681
What happened then?

15:41.852 --> 15:43.157
Those creatures arrived,

15:43.259 --> 15:46.369
took the rest of the humans away...
they weren't interested in me.

15:46.630 --> 15:49.963
I tried to fight them,
but they were too strong.

15:50.011 --> 15:52.291
Well, maybe something came
out of the black hole?

15:52.393 --> 15:54.252
Nothing comes out of a black hole.

15:54.408 --> 15:55.829
Nothing boarded this ship.

15:55.947 --> 15:58.236
I'm afraid you'll never
see your crew again.

16:00.369 --> 16:03.658
Black hole. 400-mile spaceship.

16:05.190 --> 16:06.910
It's a matter of time!

16:08.687 --> 16:09.807
Pay attention.

16:31.952 --> 16:34.749
Hello? Back with us?

16:37.110 --> 16:40.866
No, don't try to speak, just relax.
You'll be fine.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.819
Full conversion wasn't necessary...

16:44.786 --> 16:46.826
..though it will be in time.

16:48.613 --> 16:50.053
Sleep now.

17:09.538 --> 17:10.578
Hmm.

17:15.030 --> 17:20.508
Oh, awake, is it? Awake now.
Good, settle.

17:41.081 --> 17:42.417
Wait for me!

17:42.714 --> 17:43.994
Doctor!

17:48.154 --> 17:54.123
Pain. Pain. Pain.

17:58.037 --> 18:03.584
Pain. Pain. Pain.

18:09.110 --> 18:14.740
Pain. Pain. Pain.

18:28.180 --> 18:34.279
Pain. Pain. Pain.

18:36.170 --> 18:41.912
Pain. Pain. Pain.

18:47.278 --> 18:52.857
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:06.790 --> 19:11.248
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:21.029 --> 19:25.607
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:30.667 --> 19:35.037
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:37.133 --> 19:42.787
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:44.203 --> 19:49.512
Pain. Pain. Pain.

19:50.234 --> 19:52.114
Pain.

19:59.739 --> 20:01.924
Who's making all that noise?

20:02.627 --> 20:03.987
Who is it?

20:12.900 --> 20:15.455
Pain. Pain. Pain.

20:15.579 --> 20:20.884
Right, what's the matter with
you, hmm, making all that fuss?

20:20.932 --> 20:23.611
Pain. Pain.

20:24.199 --> 20:25.479
Let's see now.

20:26.325 --> 20:30.877
Pain. Pain. Pain.

20:32.750 --> 20:33.789
Pain...

20:37.500 --> 20:39.062
That's better, isn't it?

20:39.656 --> 20:43.523
Right, then, Mr Razor,
might as well do the rounds, now I'm here.

20:43.639 --> 20:47.203
Rounds, yes, it is. Rounds, good, yes.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.556
Pain. Pain.

21:26.994 --> 21:32.494
Pain. Pain. Pain.

21:32.650 --> 21:36.908
- Sorry, mate. Really sorry.
- Pain.

21:49.472 --> 21:53.081
Kill. Me. Kill. Me.

21:53.183 --> 21:54.940
Kill. Me. Kill...

21:55.044 --> 21:56.862
Sorry, sorry.

22:02.605 --> 22:06.324
This way, Mr Razor, look sharp!

22:31.746 --> 22:33.293
Would you like some tea?

22:38.479 --> 22:39.979
This way, this way.

22:40.175 --> 22:41.753
What about him?

22:42.573 --> 22:45.869
- It's all right. They don't feel pain.
- I think they do.

22:46.362 --> 22:47.518
Yes, they do.

22:47.675 --> 22:48.897
So, why did you say they don't?

22:48.944 --> 22:52.260
It was a clever lie, but you
see straight through me.

22:53.089 --> 22:55.269
Come, tea, this way.

22:55.378 --> 22:57.050
What are those things?

22:57.119 --> 22:59.807
People, people, people,
people, they're people.

23:00.362 --> 23:01.854
What are you doing to them?

23:02.286 --> 23:03.886
Curing them.

23:04.932 --> 23:06.212
Come.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.073
Psst!

23:11.595 --> 23:12.956
In here.

23:34.037 --> 23:36.949
Do you want the good tea or the bad tea?

23:37.146 --> 23:38.356
What's the difference?

23:38.552 --> 23:40.982
I call one good, one bad.

23:41.347 --> 23:43.894
Er, I'll take the good one.

23:43.990 --> 23:48.709
Excellent, positive attitude. Will
help with the horror to come.

23:49.044 --> 23:50.404
What horror?

23:51.624 --> 23:53.104
Mainly the tea.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.394
Where am I?

24:16.488 --> 24:17.768
Hospital.

24:19.507 --> 24:21.787
Yeah, but where?

24:22.143 --> 24:23.875
The ship. You are on the ship.

24:23.943 --> 24:27.342
I was on a ship, yeah,
but it wasn't like this.

24:27.390 --> 24:31.563
You were at top of the ship
and now you are at bottom.

24:36.946 --> 24:41.258
Ship, top, bottom, see?

24:41.696 --> 24:43.055
Yes.

24:43.415 --> 24:44.676
How did I get here?

24:44.787 --> 24:46.555
You were sick, very sick.

24:47.907 --> 24:52.302
Broken. Heart broken... new heart.

24:52.350 --> 24:53.461
Good, is it?

24:53.509 --> 24:55.665
I... haven't dared look yet.

24:55.859 --> 24:58.586
Is good, is very good. Shiny.

24:58.774 --> 25:02.766
You can carry it off. Not everybody can.

25:03.062 --> 25:07.469
For some people, it all
goes a bit, you know...

25:07.677 --> 25:08.957
What?

25:09.808 --> 25:11.055
Vending machine.

25:13.422 --> 25:17.758
Drink it while it is very hot...
the pain will disguise the taste.

25:18.263 --> 25:19.438
Thanks.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.446
How long have I been here?

25:22.522 --> 25:24.801
Oh, weeks. Many weeks.

25:24.888 --> 25:26.567
Maybe months.

25:26.789 --> 25:27.930
God.

25:27.983 --> 25:29.622
Is good... you get strong.

25:29.710 --> 25:32.243
But I came here with people...
my friends.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.760
Oh.

25:34.290 --> 25:35.954
They don't look so bad.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.720
That's them, that's my friends.

25:38.831 --> 25:41.227
I know. I make picture for you.

25:42.352 --> 25:43.431
You like?

25:43.550 --> 25:45.305
Where are they now?
Are they ok?

25:45.437 --> 25:47.782
Well, they're fine.
Look at them.

25:47.954 --> 25:49.508
Yeah, but are they ok now?

25:49.766 --> 25:53.342
That is now.
That is right now, that is them.

25:53.390 --> 25:56.938
- Is live.
- Yeah, but... the picture, it's frozen.

25:57.172 --> 25:58.352
No.

25:58.795 --> 26:01.305
Yeah, it is, they're not moving.
Look at them.

26:02.630 --> 26:05.446
They are at top of ship.

26:05.586 --> 26:07.349
Top of ship very slow.

26:07.454 --> 26:10.930
We are at bottom. Bottom much faster.

26:11.399 --> 26:13.024
Very fast bottom.

26:18.505 --> 26:20.105
Yeah, I don't understand.

26:23.289 --> 26:24.889
So you don't know?

26:26.703 --> 26:28.183
About what?

26:30.558 --> 26:33.917
Short version...
because of the black hole,

26:34.129 --> 26:39.790
time is moving faster at this
end of the ship than the other.

26:40.879 --> 26:42.563
It's all about gravity.

26:47.157 --> 26:49.555
Gravity slows down time.

26:49.797 --> 26:55.125
The closer you are to the source of
gravity, the slower time will move.

26:55.204 --> 26:56.503
If you're standing in your garden,

26:56.550 --> 26:59.070
your head is travelling faster
through time than your feet.

27:01.743 --> 27:04.665
Don't they teach you this
stuff at space school?

27:08.210 --> 27:11.531
See he's raising that eyebrow?
That's his sarcasm face,

27:12.055 --> 27:13.581
he's making a joke.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.125
He's been raising that
eyebrow for a week.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.623
So when are you going to tell me?

27:18.670 --> 27:21.461
- Tell you what?
- How I can get back up there.

27:21.946 --> 27:24.094
I already told you.
You can't leave here.

27:24.165 --> 27:25.222
I'm sorry.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.109
What are you doing in here?

27:27.336 --> 27:29.258
She works for me now... we agreed.

27:29.360 --> 27:31.696
Everyone here works for me!

27:31.883 --> 27:34.657
There's a floor out there,
needs cleaning.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.235
Running all the way!

27:37.782 --> 27:39.454
I know you dream of leaving.

27:39.586 --> 27:42.266
No, me? Never.

27:42.789 --> 27:48.180
This is your heart now. Outside this
hospital, it will stop working.

27:49.290 --> 27:52.008
Woh! It's a good thing you've
got all those locks, then,

27:52.064 --> 27:53.860
in case I accidently wander off.

27:57.102 --> 27:59.430
Yeah... better get mopping.

28:02.552 --> 28:04.040
Don't change the channel.

28:05.704 --> 28:09.461
A week, raising his eyebrow...
why would I change?

28:10.797 --> 28:15.321
Space school? I'm basically the janitor.

28:17.059 --> 28:20.219
That's a good job.
But you've got to concentrate more.

28:20.547 --> 28:22.563
Now, listen.

28:23.868 --> 28:27.704
He's going to do an explanation.
That always takes a while.

28:28.087 --> 28:30.469
The months will fly by.

28:36.532 --> 28:40.549
A black hole isn't just any old gravity.
It's Superman gravity.

28:40.750 --> 28:43.954
You really want to slow down time,
park next to one of these guys.

28:44.110 --> 28:49.368
Trouble is, one end of the ship
is closer to the Superman gravity

28:49.683 --> 28:51.258
than the other.

29:40.302 --> 29:42.380
Wait for me.

29:48.210 --> 29:49.915
How much longer, Doctor?

29:51.044 --> 29:52.724
How many more years?

29:56.830 --> 29:59.603
But what about these life forms...
what are they?

29:59.677 --> 30:01.688
Where did they come from?
How can there be so many?

30:01.736 --> 30:04.994
Those are the descendants
of your crewmates.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.111
Two days for you,
generations for them.

30:08.209 --> 30:09.720
- What are these... What?
- Look.

30:11.313 --> 30:13.153
What kind of treatment is that?

30:15.173 --> 30:16.989
Why won't you ever explain?

30:17.408 --> 30:20.634
I do explain. They are
the special patients.

30:21.767 --> 30:24.376
When do those bag things
come off their heads?

30:24.455 --> 30:25.709
They don't.

30:25.798 --> 30:26.861
They don't?

30:26.955 --> 30:29.955
Conversion is permanent.

30:31.711 --> 30:32.947
Why?

30:34.150 --> 30:39.517
We are dying. All of us
on this ship, dying.

30:52.177 --> 30:53.577
They are the cure.

30:54.178 --> 30:56.090
They are the future.

30:57.990 --> 31:04.504
Die. Me. Die. Me.

31:05.395 --> 31:07.762
Die. Me.

31:07.864 --> 31:10.802
To survive,
they are what we must all become.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.168
I will show you.

31:12.765 --> 31:14.062
Where are we going?

31:14.110 --> 31:17.575
Outside. You always want to go outside.
We go outside.

31:19.473 --> 31:25.059
Wait for me! Wait for me.

31:45.310 --> 31:46.670
Everyone looks so sick.

31:47.703 --> 31:49.621
This was a good place once,

31:49.783 --> 31:53.215
hundreds of years ago, when
the settlers first came here,

31:53.422 --> 31:57.668
but this ship is old,
everything is dying.

32:01.023 --> 32:04.879
Our world is rust, our
air is engine fumes.

32:05.062 --> 32:10.770
So we must evolve to survive,
but evolution is not fast enough.

32:12.984 --> 32:16.473
The special patients, they are strong.

32:16.700 --> 32:20.231
Soon we will all be upgraded like them.

32:20.293 --> 32:21.520
They're in pain.

32:21.633 --> 32:25.660
The pain will be cured. And
the exodus will begin.

32:25.785 --> 32:27.043
Exodus?

32:27.434 --> 32:29.176
Operation Exodus.

32:29.387 --> 32:33.512
We will leave this city, we will
climb up through this ship,

32:33.801 --> 32:35.621
and we will take command.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.150
Well, you could just go up right now.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.262
We have to be strong.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.801
There are lifts.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.440
There are many dangers.

32:44.770 --> 32:47.215
I've been up there,
there's a friend of mine, he could help.

32:47.391 --> 32:50.895
You do not understand
the dangers.

32:51.950 --> 32:57.069
Many years ago, there was an
expedition... to floor 507,

32:57.254 --> 33:00.035
the largest of the solar farms.

33:01.378 --> 33:02.658
And?

33:04.214 --> 33:05.374
Silence.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.981
They never came back.

33:09.653 --> 33:13.461
There is something up there.
And we must be strong.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.422
Return to the hospital.

33:15.470 --> 33:17.465
- I don't...
- You see, my dear.

33:17.550 --> 33:20.567
You must be strong
to leave the hospital.

33:20.840 --> 33:24.504
And you will be soon. Very soon.

33:25.997 --> 33:28.020
Return to the hospital.

33:32.063 --> 33:34.137
Sorry, pressed for time.

33:34.374 --> 33:35.559
That was good.

33:35.641 --> 33:36.692
Venusian Akido.

33:36.746 --> 33:38.981
I thought you needed
four arms for Venusian?

33:39.030 --> 33:42.004
I've got hidden talents,
as well as hidden arms.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.260
But it's been ten minutes,

34:05.313 --> 34:06.687
so she must have been down

34:06.735 --> 34:07.954
- there for years.
- Yeah.

34:08.002 --> 34:10.907
We can take the TARDIS,
go back and get it right.

34:10.955 --> 34:12.070
This close to a black hole,

34:12.118 --> 34:14.446
we'll never be able to
pilot her accurately.

34:16.547 --> 34:18.516
Do you think they're coming down here?

34:18.590 --> 34:21.070
Because if they are,
where does that lift arrive?

34:23.585 --> 34:24.933
Just asking.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.855
You are dear to me.

34:31.110 --> 34:34.402
You are my dearest person.

34:34.761 --> 34:35.972
- You are like...
- I know.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.266
..a mother to me.

34:37.516 --> 34:39.284
Definitely not a mother.

34:40.632 --> 34:42.136
Or an aunt.

34:42.753 --> 34:43.911
No.

34:44.010 --> 34:46.925
But this question you must not ask.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.175
Why not?

34:50.230 --> 34:52.925
Because if you do, I
think I might tell you.

34:55.324 --> 34:59.582
Ah, sorry, mate. Guess
what I'm about to do.

34:59.630 --> 35:01.129
Do not. Do not do this.

35:01.237 --> 35:03.230
I'm going to ask you again.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.646
When you hug me...

35:10.070 --> 35:11.949
..it hurts my heart.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.989
Ah, sweet.

35:15.418 --> 35:19.269
No, your chest unit. It digs right in.

35:41.310 --> 35:42.724
Are you sure about the mask?

35:42.772 --> 35:43.935
- Is burgling mask.
- Why?

35:43.983 --> 35:44.998
Just in case.

35:45.046 --> 35:46.271
- In case of what?
- Shh!

35:50.332 --> 35:52.052
But it's locked.

35:54.176 --> 35:55.645
Where did you get that?

35:55.750 --> 35:57.215
I have burglary skills.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.863
They don't let just anyone wear
a mask like this, you know.

36:00.129 --> 36:02.332
It's got your name on the label.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.926
I also have key to operating theatre.

36:08.441 --> 36:10.324
I clean up on Wednesdays.

36:23.459 --> 36:24.871
It's all right.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.670
It's just, you know... work-in-progress.

36:31.895 --> 36:34.793
So, these lifts, where do we find them?

36:36.066 --> 36:37.862
It's through there somewhere.

36:37.910 --> 36:40.363
Oh, I like the hat!

36:41.863 --> 36:44.589
I'm going to ask for a hat
when it's my turn.

36:44.699 --> 36:45.754
Your turn?

36:45.846 --> 36:47.038
No, actually.

36:47.110 --> 36:50.301
I'm afraid, Miss Potts,
it's your turn.

36:50.535 --> 36:52.129
Thank you for bringing her,
Mr Razor.

36:52.197 --> 36:56.926
Ah, you see through my clever disguise.
Stupid thing.

36:57.263 --> 37:00.793
You didn't.
Please, tell me you didn't.

37:00.902 --> 37:05.582
Is for your own good, make you strong.
Ready for the exodus.

37:05.754 --> 37:08.886
I'm sorry about the deception...
it's best to get people in here

37:08.934 --> 37:10.207
without them knowing why.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.566
We don't want screaming in the
main part of the hospital.

37:12.614 --> 37:15.480
Don't you touch me!
Don't you lay a finger on me!

37:15.684 --> 37:18.285
This unit of yours won't last
forever you know...

37:18.371 --> 37:19.840
you need the full upgrade.

37:19.973 --> 37:22.212
You're not going to turn me
into one of those things.

37:22.550 --> 37:26.879
I'm rebuilding you to survive
in a world not made for flesh.

37:26.988 --> 37:31.535
Look at them.
They're screaming in pain, alive.

37:31.855 --> 37:33.770
But we've got something for that now.

37:33.881 --> 37:36.521
This won't stop you feeling pain, but...

37:38.207 --> 37:40.254
..it will stop you caring about it.

37:42.179 --> 37:43.832
It fits over your head.

37:49.777 --> 37:52.949
Ok,
you two, welcome to a new time zone.

37:53.117 --> 37:54.652
Not knowing the differential,

37:54.770 --> 37:57.441
I don't know how much
time has passed here.

38:00.277 --> 38:02.157
Right, we need to find out
more about this ship.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.223
On it.

38:03.277 --> 38:07.051
No, Missy, you do it.
Nardole, you come with me.

38:07.590 --> 38:09.621
But I'm the computer guy,
that's always me.

38:09.699 --> 38:11.207
Sorry, she's cleverer.

38:11.336 --> 38:12.495
She's more evil.

38:12.550 --> 38:14.069
- Same thing.
- Really isn't.

38:14.117 --> 38:16.035
Oh, it is a little bit...
a little bit the same.

38:16.083 --> 38:17.098
Anyway...

38:17.146 --> 38:19.215
- Yes, thank you.
- Nardole!

38:30.013 --> 38:31.208
Hello.

38:34.184 --> 38:35.927
Hello, ordinary person.

38:36.122 --> 38:38.825
Please maintain a minimum
separation of three feet.

38:39.239 --> 38:41.668
I'm really trying not to kill
anyone today, but it would be

38:41.739 --> 38:46.770
tremendously helpful if your major
arteries were out of reach.

38:49.350 --> 38:52.231
I have been so looking
forward to meeting you.

38:52.466 --> 38:55.462
Right, I'm very happy for you.

38:55.536 --> 38:57.700
I was watching you on the screen,

38:57.952 --> 39:01.592
it took me a while to
work out who you were.

39:37.390 --> 39:41.502
Oh, there's always a scary
thing with you, isn't there?

39:41.597 --> 39:43.437
Are you only getting that now?

39:45.646 --> 39:48.476
Oh, this is super interesting.

39:49.140 --> 39:52.906
I assumed this ship was from Earth,
full of squishable little humans,

39:52.968 --> 39:55.607
but it's not from Earth at all, is it?

39:55.663 --> 39:57.382
You don't remember me, do you?

39:57.383 --> 40:02.742
Looks like an Earth-like planet, but
not Earth itself. Very Earth-like.

40:02.843 --> 40:04.189
If planets had twins...

40:04.273 --> 40:06.296
You don't remember being
here before, do you?

40:06.429 --> 40:07.629
I've never been here before.

40:07.742 --> 40:10.468
Will you please stop wittering on
or I'll have to splat your brains

40:10.516 --> 40:12.695
- for finger paint?
- Oh, you have been here before.

40:12.751 --> 40:14.437
You really can trust me on that.

40:14.536 --> 40:17.937
Planet, planet, which planet...?

40:18.830 --> 40:23.148
There's a lot of genetics,
bio-engineering.

40:23.343 --> 40:26.398
Lot of stuff about
something called Exodus

40:27.325 --> 40:29.000
Operation Exodus.

41:10.270 --> 41:12.652
Look at that!
This ship is from Mondas!

41:21.018 --> 41:25.783
It's a Cyberman.
A Mondasian Cyberman!

41:27.455 --> 41:30.414
- Doctor!
- "Doctor! Oh, Doctor! Doctor!"

41:35.479 --> 41:36.893
Ok, listen to me.

41:37.291 --> 41:39.760
I may be about to take that silly
little gun away from you...

41:39.808 --> 41:44.033
He'll never forgive you,
you know, he'll never set you free.

41:44.307 --> 41:49.268
Not when he discovers what you did
to his little friend.

41:49.377 --> 41:51.518
I haven't done anything to
his silly little friend.

41:51.566 --> 41:54.885
Oh, but I'm afraid you did...

41:57.020 --> 41:58.580
..a long time ago.

42:01.143 --> 42:02.526
You're brand-new.

42:02.948 --> 42:05.377
Fresh out the factory...
you're not ready for a fight yet.

42:05.535 --> 42:07.534
He does looks a little bit ready.

42:07.729 --> 42:10.619
Bill Potts.
Do you know where she is?

42:10.752 --> 42:14.690
- Where is Bill Potts?
- Doc... tor.

42:15.185 --> 42:16.464
You know me.

42:16.551 --> 42:19.470
You are Doc... tor.

42:19.550 --> 42:21.526
Am I supposed to know
what you're talking about?

42:21.703 --> 42:25.893
Would it help you focus
if I extracted some of your vital organs

42:25.955 --> 42:27.112
and made a lovely soup?

42:27.177 --> 42:31.026
You would never be so...
self-destructive.

42:31.077 --> 42:32.236
So what?

42:32.456 --> 42:33.948
But then again...

42:34.979 --> 42:36.318
neither would I.

42:37.703 --> 42:41.627
Listen. We mean you no harm.
We're just passing through.

42:41.704 --> 42:43.463
We're looking for
Bill Potts, friend of mine.

42:43.510 --> 42:44.596
Bill Potts.

42:44.644 --> 42:46.385
Yes, Bill Potts.

42:46.444 --> 42:50.323
You're a Cyberman, you're part of
a neural net... can you find her?

42:50.482 --> 42:53.660
I love disguises.

42:54.405 --> 42:56.354
Do you still like disguises?

42:57.043 --> 43:01.487
Of course, they are rather
necessary when you happen to be

43:01.791 --> 43:05.393
someone's former Prime Minister.

43:08.946 --> 43:10.338
Accessing...

43:10.448 --> 43:11.469
Get back from it.

43:11.518 --> 43:15.424
Bill Potts. Locating...

43:15.716 --> 43:17.487
Bill Potts.

43:19.448 --> 43:23.346
I am Bill Potts.

43:24.239 --> 43:31.580
Hello, Missy. I'm the Master, and
I'm very worried about my future.

43:33.246 --> 43:34.729
Give us a kiss!

43:35.380 --> 43:40.283
Bill? Bill, talk to me.
What have they done to you?

43:40.487 --> 43:43.971
It's Operation Exodus, whatever that is.

43:44.510 --> 43:47.416
Oh, wrong name for a start.

43:47.583 --> 43:49.690
I... waited.

43:49.870 --> 43:52.533
This is not an exodus, is it?

43:54.276 --> 43:56.760
More of a beginning, really, isn't it?

43:56.893 --> 43:59.221
I waited.

43:59.322 --> 44:02.072
In fact,
do you know what I'd call it?

44:08.660 --> 44:10.621
I'd call it a genesis.

44:11.950 --> 44:13.449
You've met the ex?

44:13.574 --> 44:18.277
Specifically, the Genesis
of the Cybermen.

44:22.956 --> 44:27.496
I waited for you.
