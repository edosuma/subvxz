(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:35.635 --> 00:38.504
Hey, everybody,
you know what time it is?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.239
Mystery time.

00:40.241 --> 00:43.175
But it's also 11:08,
no, 11:09.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.577
Well, it's actually
12:35, so...

00:48.648 --> 00:49.982
Did you just take a shower?

00:49.984 --> 00:51.250
Yeah, why?

00:51.252 --> 00:53.085
Well, we have
a bird bath outside.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.154
A bird...
(BLEEP) you, Marquess.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.555
I also used the toilet

00:56.557 --> 00:58.323
and left you
a little surprise in there.

00:58.325 --> 01:01.660
Oh, and I also ejaculated
all over your toothbrush,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.262
so why don't you go
clean it off

01:03.264 --> 01:05.197
in your precious bird bath?

01:05.199 --> 01:08.734
Well, someone woke up
on the wrong side of the nest.

01:09.369 --> 01:10.502
Yung?

01:10.504 --> 01:11.870
We have a new mystery.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.540
YUNG HEE: (PANTING)
Yeah, just, uh...

01:14.542 --> 01:15.941
Just give me one second.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.409
(CONTINUES PANTING)

01:17.411 --> 01:19.011
What are you doing in there?

01:19.013 --> 01:20.546
YUNG HEE:
Nothing, I'm, just...

01:20.548 --> 01:22.047
I'm almost done.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.248
(GASPS)

01:23.250 --> 01:25.884
(WHISPERS)
Is she masturbating?

01:25.886 --> 01:29.688
(GROANS) Oh,
and I just jacked off.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.057
Come on, come on out of there.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.592
Ah, wake up.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.527
Pigeon, stop.
Let's just go.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.196
No way. I'm going in there.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.364
-I want to watch.
-No!

01:39.366 --> 01:41.033
Hey, need a hand?

01:41.534 --> 01:43.035
Pigeon!

01:43.037 --> 01:44.903
You're exercising?

01:44.905 --> 01:47.706
(SCOFFS) You know what?
I'm glad I just jacked off.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.274
-Ugh.
-(PIGEON SIGHS)

01:50.610 --> 01:53.745
Come on, team,
it's mystery time.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.281
YUNG HEE: I'm so excited
the mystery is going
to be in San Francisco.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.217
Damn, this is going to be fun.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.385
Fisherman's Wharf,
cable cars,

02:00.387 --> 02:01.720
the Wailing Wall...

02:01.722 --> 02:02.955
I love San Francisco.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.723
Aw, man.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.558
Hell, maybe we can get tickets
to the Sydney Opera House.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.094
Well, Dad, don't forget we
also have to solve a mystery.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.929
Yeah, but this is going
to be a quick one.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.465
This lady says
her dog doesn't like
her new boyfriend.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.734
Trust me, we'll be in and out,

02:15.736 --> 02:17.603
and even if we don't solve it

02:17.605 --> 02:20.539
it doesn't matter,
because it's a stupid mystery.

02:26.312 --> 02:29.014
Thanks for coming.
We thought you might think
this was a stupid mystery.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.817
Oh, there's no such thing
as a stupid mystery, sir.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.685
(CHUCKLES)

02:33.687 --> 02:34.920
Can I get anyone anything?

02:34.922 --> 02:36.255
I'll take some Rice-A-Roni.

02:36.257 --> 02:39.191
Oh, uh, I'm not sure
if we have that.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.927
I'll bet you do.
It's the San Francisco treat.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.595
Let's all look.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.997
So, Phillip,

02:44.999 --> 02:46.698
your girlfriend's dog
doesn't like you?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.200
That's putting it mildly.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.035
I can't even be
in the same room with him.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.937
Lydia took the little bastard
out for a walk

02:51.939 --> 02:53.772
so I could at least
talk to you in peace.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.307
How is the dog with Lydia?

02:55.309 --> 02:57.543
Oh, Max loves Lydia,
he follows her everywhere.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.646
(BLEEP) it.
Make me some gazpacho.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.781
This is a stupid mystery.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.016
(DOOR OPENING)

03:05.118 --> 03:09.054
(BARKING AND GROWLING)

03:09.889 --> 03:11.490
God damn it. See?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.991
Max, no.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.627
-(CONTINUES BARKING)
-No, Max, no.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.129
I'm going to go upstairs.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.964
We appreciate you coming.

03:18.966 --> 03:22.134
You know, we met dog trainers,
pet therapists, nothing works.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.336
And Phillip's
the sweetest man in the world.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.539
It just doesn't make any sense
why Max doesn't like him.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.808
Do you think that
when you're not around

03:29.810 --> 03:33.345
maybe Phillip puts
weird objects up
Max's little butthole?

03:33.347 --> 03:34.880
Oh, my God.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.316
What? That would account
for the hostility.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.318
I'm going to make myself
some Rice-A-Roni.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.919
-(GASPS)
-Does anyone want some?

03:40.921 --> 03:43.188
You have to have it
while you're in San Francisco.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.423
MIKE: The pantry!

03:44.425 --> 03:45.624
It's written
in the city charter.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.493
I don't mean
to be insensitive,

03:48.495 --> 03:50.996
but have you considered
finding Max another home?

03:50.998 --> 03:53.031
I could never part with Max.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.901
He came into my life
when I needed him the most.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.070
You see, I was married before.

03:58.671 --> 04:00.672
Andrew.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.574
But he died tragically.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.510
You best stir that, Lydia.

04:05.512 --> 04:06.678
Oh, right.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.180
(BARKS)

04:08.182 --> 04:10.215
Then this little guy showed up
on my doorstep

04:10.217 --> 04:11.617
when I was at my lowest.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.619
He was like
a gift from heaven.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.521
And now I've met Phillip
and I'm finally in love again.

04:16.523 --> 04:19.358
I just don't know what to do.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.525
I know what you could do.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.060
You could fluff that rice

04:22.062 --> 04:23.895
and then maybe get started
on the main course.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.365
I think Phillip is making
some gazpacho

04:26.367 --> 04:28.467
so we're gonna have
plenty of sides.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.404
You know what, Phillip?

04:32.406 --> 04:33.972
Don't offer to make gazpacho

04:33.974 --> 04:36.241
if you're not going to make
gazpacho, all right?

04:36.243 --> 04:38.243
Did anyone notice
what I noticed?

04:38.245 --> 04:41.313
Yeah, that Lydia
has got a real pair of
(BLEEP) sucking lips.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.381
-No.
-No?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.216
-No.
-Oh, okay.

04:44.218 --> 04:48.887
No, that that photo of Andrew
looked an awful lot like Max.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.423
The dog? Well, wait,
what are you saying?

04:51.425 --> 04:53.725
I believe that Andrew
missed Lydia so much

04:53.727 --> 04:55.927
he found a way
to be reincarnated.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.296
She said it herself.

04:57.298 --> 04:59.464
She said the dog was sent
from heaven.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.899
(GASPS) So that would explain

05:00.901 --> 05:03.068
why he hates
her new boyfriend.

05:03.070 --> 05:06.471
Where the (BLEEP)
is the Mystery Mobile?
This is where we parked.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.640
(SIRENS WAILING)

05:10.743 --> 05:12.978
You know what, I think
this was a happy accident.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.780
Yeah, maybe not for whoever

05:14.782 --> 05:16.348
just got put
in that ambulance.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.785
Because now we get
to ride in the cable car.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.820
-(BELL RINGS)
-Ooh, feel that wind!

05:21.822 --> 05:23.755
That's why they call it
the Windy City.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.257
Dad, be careful.

05:25.259 --> 05:26.625
Who's the parent here, Yung?

05:26.627 --> 05:28.694
Ooh. Can we get
some ice cream later?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.429
You already had dessert.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.030
So, now what do we do?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.433
Do we tell Lydia that her dog
is her late husband?

05:34.435 --> 05:35.934
Not yet.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.803
I want to be sure.
I have a friend, Brianna.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.671
She's in my spin class,
she's a medium.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.773
She knows all
about the afterlife

05:41.775 --> 05:43.775
and is able to communicate
with the spirit world.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.178
I thought
you could communicate
with the spirit world.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.113
Well, I can,

05:48.115 --> 05:49.715
but it's hard

05:49.717 --> 05:52.184
and I have to, like, scrunch
my face to concentrate

05:52.186 --> 05:53.952
and my brow lines
are getting so deep.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.620
And then I'd have to
get fillers...

05:55.622 --> 05:57.222
Then I get filler face.

05:57.224 --> 05:59.391
You know what?
I'd rather just call Brianna.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.226
Pigeon, give me your phone.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.628
Oh, what a pretty screensaver.

06:03.630 --> 06:04.830
What is that, an orchid?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.231
It's Lydia's vagina.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.533
I snagged an up-skirt
before we left.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.035
-My God!
-Yeah, I know.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.970
These Bay Area hippies.
(LAUGHS)

06:11.972 --> 06:13.238
They don't wear underwear,
I guess.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.306
Okay...

06:15.508 --> 06:17.576
Brianna?
(SQUEALS) It's Marquess.

06:17.578 --> 06:18.877
Hey, girl.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.078
MIKE: Oh, whoa!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.913
Dad!

06:21.915 --> 06:23.982
(GASPS) Get out,
what are you doing
in San Francisco?

06:23.984 --> 06:26.818
MIKE: I'm okay, I'm catching
up with you soon.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.687
What! (GASPS) Brianna.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.355
I thought you
broke up with him.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.023
(CHUCKLES) So, where are you?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.326
MARQUESS: Oh, my God.
I think we're near the Wharf!

06:34.328 --> 06:36.495
(LAUGHS) Love it.
Cocktail hour.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.663
See you soon.
She's here!

06:40.366 --> 06:42.100
In your face, Yung.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.202
Mmm, so good.

I don't think it was
very responsible of you
to drink so much.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.614
We still have
to solve a mystery.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.882
Oh, please.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.283
I had two mojitos.

Oh, and we both took Ecstasy.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.430
Mmm-hmm, is that right?

07:11.432 --> 07:13.064
Well, that's interesting.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.599
Okay, tell me more about that.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.906
Oh, I see, wow. Uh-huh.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.941
Now that's a real wow.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.543
Uh-huh. Ooh.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.777
Okay, okay.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.379
No, I get it, I hear you.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.613
And I get it.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.749
Marquess, uh,
can I talk to you

07:30.751 --> 07:33.418
and the mystery team
privately please?

07:33.420 --> 07:34.820
We'll wait in the kitchen.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.455
Let us know
if you need anything.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.957
I can go for some chicken
salad with some almonds.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.626
But not big almonds.
Just some almond slivers.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.528
Or maybe some
big almonds, too.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.131
Well, Marquess is right.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.099
This is definitely
her late husband Andrew

07:48.101 --> 07:49.968
reincarnated as a dog.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.470
(GASPS) I knew it.

07:51.472 --> 07:54.072
I mean, I had a gut feeling
and I was right.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.976
Hey, will you (BLEEP) stop?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.178
If you're gonna
rub me this hard,
at least whack me off.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.913
But there is more
to the story.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.682
Andrew didn't just die.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.650
-He was murdered.
-(ALL GASP)

08:05.652 --> 08:07.452
But there's more to the story.

08:07.454 --> 08:10.021
He was murdered by Phillip!

08:10.023 --> 08:11.323
(ALL GASP)

08:11.325 --> 08:12.924
No, but there's more
to the story!

08:12.926 --> 08:14.159
No, actually...
Actually, that was it.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.293
(GASPS)

08:15.295 --> 08:16.828
So that's why he came back.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.531
To protect his wife
from a vicious murderer.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.435
But how do we convince Lydia
that Phillip murdered Andrew?

08:23.437 --> 08:25.770
We don't.
Andrew will tell her.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.772
Marquess will turn him
back into a man.

08:27.774 --> 08:29.007
You can do that, Marquess?

08:29.009 --> 08:31.343
Uh, well... Well, I can.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.679
But as I said to Yung,
these things require...

08:34.681 --> 08:36.681
(SIGHS)
A great deal of effort.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.385
Oh, well, in that case
don't do it. Asshole.

08:40.387 --> 08:42.420
Fine, fine.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.690
(SIGHS)

08:45.692 --> 08:47.826
Mmm, on the count of three,
regain your human form,

08:47.828 --> 08:49.361
one, two, three.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.830
Okay, that should happen
in about 10 seconds.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.466
PIGEON: Oh, wow!
Marquess, are you okay?

08:54.468 --> 08:56.468
Do you need to lie down?

08:56.470 --> 08:58.570
(SCOFFS) Drama queen.

09:01.674 --> 09:02.874
I'm back.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.509
Yeah, I can't find
any almonds,

09:04.511 --> 09:06.144
do you mind pecans or...

09:06.146 --> 09:07.245
Who are you?

09:07.247 --> 09:08.813
Well, I was Jim Bankerd

09:08.815 --> 09:10.582
and then I had a heart attack
and died

09:10.584 --> 09:11.983
and I came back as your dog.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.552
And now I guess
I'm Jim Bankerd again.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.053
I mean that's what
I was telling her.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.488
I thought she understood.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.223
I've had a lot of Ecstasy.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.860
Like, way more than
the recommended amount.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.895
-Here you go.
-What the hell is this?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.430
Chicken salad.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.166
Well, I just assumed
you'd put it on a baguette

09:28.168 --> 09:30.168
or some sourdough.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.337
I mean, even a lettuce wrap.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.005
You just hand me a bowl?

09:36.275 --> 09:37.375
Who's this?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.444
-This was our dog.
-What?

09:39.446 --> 09:41.680
Don't "what" me,
you son of a bitch!

09:41.682 --> 09:43.682
But if you weren't
Lydia's late husband,

09:43.684 --> 09:45.517
why do you hate
Phillip so much?

09:45.519 --> 09:48.019
-Tell her.
-I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:48.021 --> 09:50.021
Whenever you weren't here,

09:50.023 --> 09:52.190
this piece of garbage
would put weird things
in my butthole.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.125
(BLEEP) Deviant piece of shit.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.195
Matches, pens, guitar picks,
his (BLEEP) thumbs.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.863
And he didn't do
just stuff to me.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.265
This guy is crazy.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.100
I saw him ejaculate
on your toothbrush.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.235
(STAMMERING)
Well, that's not crazy.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.737
What is wrong with you?

10:05.739 --> 10:07.372
-Lydia...
-Get out!

10:07.374 --> 10:09.107
I never want to see you again.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.942
(SIGHS)

10:12.712 --> 10:14.379
This might sound crazy,

10:14.381 --> 10:16.147
but would you like
to have dinner with me?

10:16.149 --> 10:18.583
I'd like that very much, Max.

10:18.585 --> 10:20.118
I mean Jim.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.097
Well, that was
a stupid mystery.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.165
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

10:41.407 --> 10:43.742
MAN: Mike, do you guys
have a family dog?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.143
No.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.845
MAN: Why not?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.980
Because my children believe
they are allergic to dogs.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.348
MAN:
Are they allergic to dogs?

10:50.350 --> 10:51.716
No, they're not.
