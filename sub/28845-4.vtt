00:01.120 --> 00:04.249
Previously on "Reef Break"... The Governor
would like to put you on a retainer.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.829
Our island has unique problems.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.029
Some problems, the police
don't even need to know about.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.020
You shouldn't see
what's on this computer.

00:11.044 --> 00:12.379
Your boyfriend's a cop, right?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.119
Wyatt is not my boyfriend.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.959
We are friends with benefits.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.419
I could never fool you.

00:18.420 --> 00:19.619
Except for that time you
married me

00:19.620 --> 00:20.709
and then forgot to tell me

00:20.710 --> 00:22.190
that you were
an undercover FBI agent.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.249
You're the mercenary

00:24.250 --> 00:26.419
who does a bunch of shady stuff
for Carter Eastland.

00:26.420 --> 00:28.140
I think I'm gonna enjoy
getting to know you.

00:28.164 --> 00:29.254
Well, most people do.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:22.920 --> 01:25.619
I don't know any Mr. Smith,
but if you're looking for

01:25.620 --> 01:27.999
the fat guy, last I saw,
he was cuffed in the bushes.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.620
Might even be on his way to
Central Processing right now.

01:42.830 --> 01:44.920
Hands in the air!

01:50.170 --> 01:51.570
Where the hell does
he think he's...

01:54.420 --> 01:56.830
Where the hell do you
think you're going?!

01:59.670 --> 02:01.709
You gonna go get him?

02:01.710 --> 02:03.750
We're wearing body armor,
Detective.

02:05.670 --> 02:07.430
I know this is just
your way of showing love.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.169
Hey.

02:32.170 --> 02:34.209
Hey.

02:34.210 --> 02:35.749
You looked impressive out there.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.579
Well, if I knew
I had an audience,

02:38.580 --> 02:39.789
I would've put on a real show.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.119
You know, I can get you
a wet suit

02:41.120 --> 02:42.829
and get you up on a board
in no time.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.829
I'm here on business.

02:44.830 --> 02:47.879
Come on. I think you really
want to let your hair down.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.119
I don't, actually.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.709
I want to talk about a man
with his own island,

02:52.710 --> 02:54.209
Dylan Sawyer.

02:54.210 --> 02:57.249
Well, there is a name that
brings back some memories.

02:57.250 --> 02:59.539
I'm sure it does.
We're gonna pay him a visit.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.419
We are? Why?

03:01.420 --> 03:03.499
Well, we can talk
about it in the car.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.959
It's a bit windy out here.
Let's get you dressed.

03:06.960 --> 03:08.790
Sure I can't get you
out on the water?

03:13.210 --> 03:16.749
So, where's your
fancy driver today?

03:16.750 --> 03:18.499
Day off.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.919
Day off?

03:19.920 --> 03:22.539
Yeah.

03:22.540 --> 03:25.169
So, I'm guessing this
whole trip to Dylan's island

03:25.170 --> 03:28.039
is off the official books,
right?

03:28.040 --> 03:31.209
Look, I know you
and Dylan Sawyer are friends...

03:31.210 --> 03:33.039
I wouldn't say "friends,"
exactly.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.800
That's exactly what
you said to the Governor.

03:34.824 --> 03:37.579
Work friends.

03:37.580 --> 03:39.119
You smuggled drugs for him?

03:39.120 --> 03:41.879
No, I never smuggled
drugs for him.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.999
I mean, I may have put
a package in my surf bag

03:45.000 --> 03:47.379
that smelled like weed
once or twice,

03:47.380 --> 03:48.619
but... you know what?
It was probably money,

03:48.620 --> 03:50.579
because all of Dylan's money
smells like weed.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.749
Do me a favor?

03:51.750 --> 03:53.539
Don't share
inculpatory statements

03:53.540 --> 03:54.540
about drug felonies.

03:54.541 --> 03:56.039
Okay, do me a favor?

03:56.040 --> 03:59.959
Don't refer to Dylan's
marijuana as "drugs."

03:59.960 --> 04:02.330
He'll find that very offensive.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.539
Why are you in my chair?

04:24.540 --> 04:27.669
DEA asked me to check in
on your big bust.

04:27.670 --> 04:30.499
Anonymous tip on
a Thai fishing boat.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.460
Yeah, we caught the guys.
Enough caffeine and meth

04:32.461 --> 04:34.141
to keep the South Pacific high
for a month.

04:34.165 --> 04:35.039
Caffeine and meth?

04:35.040 --> 04:37.499
That's ingredients for Yaba.
Yeah.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.499
Which the Thais manufacture
in the mainland.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.329
Yeah.

04:41.330 --> 04:42.879
So...

04:42.880 --> 04:43.790
They're importing
the ingredients

04:43.791 --> 04:45.119
to cook it on the Reef.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.289
That's an amazing deduction.

04:48.290 --> 04:49.669
Okay.

04:49.670 --> 04:51.579
Mind if I sit in
on your interrogation?

04:51.580 --> 04:54.539
Just keep your mouth shut
and let me take the lead.

04:54.540 --> 04:56.580
You know me... low profile.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.789
Wow, this is one
long-ass boat ride.

05:06.790 --> 05:10.039
If I had access to the
Governor's fancy private plane,

05:10.040 --> 05:11.959
I would've just
flown it right out here.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.119
No pilot, no flight plan.

05:14.120 --> 05:16.879
As you inferred,
given the nature of the trip,

05:16.880 --> 05:19.419
we thought it'd be wise
to limit our footprint.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.709
Good point.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.039
Now, remember, you're here

05:23.040 --> 05:25.419
because, to Dylan,
you're a friendly face.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.119
Last I knew.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.459
What does that mean, Cat?
Last you knew?

05:29.460 --> 05:31.749
Well, you know,
I haven't seen him in a while.

05:31.750 --> 05:32.710
Since when?

05:32.711 --> 05:33.999
Since that whole

05:34.000 --> 05:35.829
"I married an undercover
FBI agent

05:35.830 --> 05:38.999
"who brought down half of the
underworld on the Reef" thing?

05:39.000 --> 05:42.079
You know this is gonna be
really tricky, right?

05:42.080 --> 05:43.119
I like tricky.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.879
I'm not kidding, Cat.

05:44.880 --> 05:48.419
If you can give Dylan a comfort
level, that'd be great.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.920
Remember, this is
a political negotiation.

06:10.250 --> 06:12.420
Whoa! Quite
the welcoming committee.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.999
You know Dylan's son.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.209
Beau! Gosh, I haven't seen
you since...

06:20.210 --> 06:21.879
Before I left for Cambridge.

06:21.880 --> 06:25.579
Yeah. Bring it in for a hug!

06:25.580 --> 06:27.669
Or a handshake. Alright.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.249
Lieutenant Governor.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.499
Beau.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.999
Dad's waiting up at the house.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.459
We're gonna have to
sweep your boat,

06:33.460 --> 06:35.789
and we'll need to
take your phones.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.460
We're not giving up our phones.

06:52.460 --> 06:54.580
That's a lot of phones.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.710
Glad you came, Cat.
Really smoothing things over.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.079
I'll go around the back.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.830
- Take 3 o'clock.
- Yeah.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.120
Mr. Sawyer.

07:58.210 --> 08:01.579
I'm Lieutenant Governor
Ana Dumont.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.999
And you showed up.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.960
Well, I just wanted to see
if you'd kiss me or kill me.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.459
Kind of a risk, then.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.709
Last I remember, you were
not the killing kind.

08:12.710 --> 08:15.210
That was a long time ago.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.120
But still holds true.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.830
You look great.

08:41.289 --> 08:43.039
He says he doesn't...
Yeah, I know.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.379
He's been saying it
for the last half-hour.

08:45.380 --> 08:48.539
I now know how to
play dumb in Thai.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.039
Look, we know there's a lab
somewhere on the Reef.

08:51.040 --> 08:52.879
First one who gives it up
gets a deal...

08:52.880 --> 08:56.000
The rest of you are looking at
10 years minimum.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.999
Yeah, yeah, it's like
there's an echo in here.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.040
Get him to holding.

09:14.790 --> 09:17.289
- Jake...
- No cushy U.S. prison for you.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.039
I'm shipping you back
to Bangkok.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.580
Bang Kwang prison... that's
leg shackles and maggot soup!

09:29.000 --> 09:32.459
We're making runs
ahead of the lab.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.380
They're planning to set up
in the next two weeks.

09:34.404 --> 09:35.459
Where?

09:35.460 --> 09:38.079
I really don't know,
but it's gonna be big.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.119
There are 10, 15 more shipments

09:40.120 --> 09:41.879
coming through
the Southeast Slot,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.579
and they're sending The Chemist.

09:43.580 --> 09:47.579
- The Chemist?
- Who's The Chemist?

09:47.580 --> 09:50.119
The Chemist from Chiang Mai.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.290
The Chemist. From Chiang Mai.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.169
It's killing you how
I knew he spoke English.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.829
It's killing you not telling me.

10:01.830 --> 10:03.379
Seem a little easy, though?

10:03.380 --> 10:04.829
How fast he gave it up?

10:04.830 --> 10:06.910
You threatened him with
one of the five worst prisons

10:06.934 --> 10:07.540
on the planet.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.879
Still. So what?

10:08.880 --> 10:11.419
You want me to ignore a tip
on 15 shipments of Yaba?

10:11.420 --> 10:13.919
No. I want to know
who The Chemist is

10:13.920 --> 10:17.079
and why he was supposed
to give him up.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.119
We find The Chemist,
we find the lab.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.119
I'm bringing in
my fourth major crop...

10:22.120 --> 10:24.499
No, your sixth. This was 2006.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.879
Right, 2006.

10:26.880 --> 10:28.879
Cat's on her way to Sunset...

10:28.880 --> 10:30.289
Wahine Pipe Pro.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.289
That is a huge surf competition.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.959
Volcom has her on a private jet.

10:34.960 --> 10:38.379
She decides it's a good
opportunity to move some weight.

10:38.380 --> 10:39.749
I thought you never
smuggled drugs.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.119
I did not smuggle.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.480
I was a dealer for a while,
though,

10:42.504 --> 10:44.959
but I did not have
the patience for retail.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.789
Or the public.
Or the public in general.

10:47.790 --> 10:51.379
So, I've got everything
packed, ready to go...

10:51.380 --> 10:55.669
She wants to pay me
in cases of MP3 players,

10:55.670 --> 10:57.249
fell off a truck somewhere.

10:57.250 --> 10:59.169
Okay, they were
very cool back then.

10:59.170 --> 11:01.169
I live on an island.
Off the grid.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.169
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

11:03.170 --> 11:04.919
Can we get to the point? Beau...

11:04.920 --> 11:06.879
Now, she doesn't want to hear
old crook stories

11:06.880 --> 11:08.079
any more than I do, Dad.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.749
You never had kids, right?

11:09.750 --> 11:11.329
None that I know of.

11:11.330 --> 11:13.619
As you already know,
Reef Island's been seeing

11:13.620 --> 11:17.169
an influx of smugglers
the last few months.

11:17.170 --> 11:20.379
Guns, drugs, even human cargo.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.879
Are you suggesting I have
anything to do with that?

11:22.880 --> 11:24.829
I don't touch anything
I don't make,

11:24.830 --> 11:26.879
I don't make anything
I don't grow,

11:26.880 --> 11:29.419
and I don't grow anything
but Anemone Red.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.289
Finest weed
in the South Pacific.

11:31.290 --> 11:33.289
Which is why
we've been hands off.

11:33.290 --> 11:35.709
That and because we're
your second highest source

11:35.710 --> 11:37.749
of tax revenue
and charitable donations,

11:37.750 --> 11:40.539
after Carter Eastland.

11:40.540 --> 11:43.709
Have you been approached
about using your air strip?

11:43.710 --> 11:45.539
There's a new player
on the Reef.

11:45.540 --> 11:47.579
They're setting up a lab
to make Yaba.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.919
We know that you track
boat and plane traffic

11:49.920 --> 11:51.169
coming through this corridor.

11:51.170 --> 11:52.919
They want us to spy for them.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.420
We'd like your cooperation.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.619
You're quiet.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.749
Especially for you.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.379
Well, you know me...

12:05.380 --> 12:07.379
I just came for
the free champagne,

12:07.380 --> 12:08.539
the fancy bruncheon,

12:08.540 --> 12:10.960
the possibility of a gift bag
on my way out.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.830
So, what do you think?

12:19.460 --> 12:21.580
I think there's
a deal to be made.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.829
The Governor's office
does not have standing

12:26.830 --> 12:29.039
to make an official agreement
with an illegal business.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.039
Quasi-legal.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.499
As a U.S. protectorate,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.499
we're bound by the laws
of the United States.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.709
Here's what I think.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.209
Early heads-up if the DEA
is showing any interest.

12:39.210 --> 12:41.090
Keep it off the books,
make it a handshake deal.

12:41.114 --> 12:42.944
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:46.960 --> 12:49.119
She's a little uptight.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.330
I'm just gonna go help her
relax a little.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.169
Hey.

13:05.170 --> 13:07.120
What are you doing?

13:08.420 --> 13:11.669
Anemone Red, man.

13:11.670 --> 13:13.290
Let's go get high.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.749
I am not getting high.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.499
And I told you to
let me take the lead.

13:19.500 --> 13:22.119
Do you understand
that we're not even here?

13:22.120 --> 13:24.209
If it got back to DC
that the Governor's office

13:24.210 --> 13:26.459
was communicating
with a known drug dealer...

13:26.460 --> 13:29.289
You cannot offer to
inform on the DEA.

13:29.290 --> 13:31.080
Yeah, I know that.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.209
Then why did you?

13:36.210 --> 13:38.619
Because if I asked you to
get up and leave the table,

13:38.620 --> 13:39.959
it would've looked suspicious,

13:39.960 --> 13:41.560
so I wanted to
make you pissed off enough

13:41.561 --> 13:43.601
that you got up and left
so that I could follow you,

13:43.625 --> 13:45.619
which, by the way,
happened a little too easily.

13:45.620 --> 13:46.919
What are you doing?

13:46.920 --> 13:48.459
Did you not notice

13:48.460 --> 13:50.829
that this place is suddenly
swarming with guards,

13:50.830 --> 13:52.709
including the two
who were watching us

13:52.710 --> 13:54.079
from out in the hallway?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.459
Yeah, I did, but why?
Wh... What are you thinking?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.289
I'm something really bad
is about to go down,

13:59.290 --> 14:01.380
and we need to run
like sonsabitches.

14:26.540 --> 14:27.960
Wow.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.580
It's all good, okay?
It's all good.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.620
Whoa!

15:09.170 --> 15:10.789
Do you know how to use this?

15:10.790 --> 15:12.749
After what you just did,
you don't?

15:12.750 --> 15:15.919
If Krav Maga has a firearms
class, I must've missed it.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.620
That was badass.

15:21.750 --> 15:26.079
Interpol's been tracking
a Yaba cook based in Chiang Mai.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.959
This guy had so many aliases,

15:27.960 --> 15:30.579
everyone ended up referring
to him as "The Chemist."

15:30.580 --> 15:33.999
This is the most recent image
RPD has on file.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.039
Wya Looks like our young
smuggler was telling the truth.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.800
I mean, the rest of his story
is panning out.

15:37.801 --> 15:39.550
We've already got eight bogies
coming in from the northwest,

15:39.551 --> 15:41.459
got the whole
Air and Sea Unit on them.

15:41.460 --> 15:44.749
Does it not all seem
just a little bit too easy?

15:44.750 --> 15:47.209
Where'd you get the initial tip
on the boat from?

15:47.210 --> 15:48.170
Through the Governor's office.

15:48.171 --> 15:49.619
Through your sister?

15:49.620 --> 15:50.620
Where did she get the tip from?

15:50.621 --> 15:51.709
I asked. She didn't say.

15:51.710 --> 15:52.879
Well, maybe ask again.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.999
I tried. No one's
seen her all morning.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.829
No one knows where
the Lieutenant Governor is?

15:59.830 --> 16:01.289
What about Cat?

16:01.290 --> 16:04.329
I tried her, too.
She's gone off the grid.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.999
So, they both go dark
same time as this pops up?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.039
Does that not seem
a little strange to you?

16:09.040 --> 16:11.249
Maybe we should pay
the Governor a visit.

16:11.250 --> 16:12.580
Come on.

16:42.540 --> 16:45.789
- Would you look at that?
- What the hell are they doing?

16:45.790 --> 16:47.959
Looks like there's been
a palace coup.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.420
The guards have Dylan.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.079
And it seems they're
not working alone.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.400
So then we got
to get out of here.

16:55.401 --> 16:56.921
Okay? My guess is
they've already taken

16:56.945 --> 16:58.209
the boat and the radio.

16:58.210 --> 16:59.669
Dylan has an air strip
near here.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.430
If we can get there
without them catching us,

17:01.454 --> 17:02.999
I can get us back to the Reef.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.500
You know how to fly a plane?

17:06.119 --> 17:08.829
Well, we're gonna
find out, aren't we?

17:08.829 --> 17:10.079
Come on, let's go. Come on.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.079
Ouch!

17:18.420 --> 17:19.789
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

17:19.790 --> 17:21.709
Okay. I don't want to see it.

17:21.710 --> 17:24.790
Charlie, what seems to be the...

17:28.920 --> 17:31.080
Sorry to bother you, Governor,
but we're having trouble

17:31.081 --> 17:32.881
getting in touch with
the Lieutenant Governor.

17:32.905 --> 17:34.289
I have no idea where she is.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.249
And, quite a tight schedule.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.419
So, if you don't mind...

17:37.420 --> 17:40.879
How does such a bad liar
win four elections?

17:40.880 --> 17:43.289
By putting the good people
of the Reef first.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.919
Ahead of special interests
every single day.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.749
Right, but while you're busy
doing that,

17:47.750 --> 17:50.749
RPD is chasing a dozen drug
boats around the Pacific Ocean.

17:50.750 --> 17:52.669
We're concerned
that we're being decoyed.

17:52.670 --> 17:54.249
Stand down, Andy!

17:54.250 --> 17:57.169
It's alright, Andy.

17:57.170 --> 17:58.420
A moment?

18:01.540 --> 18:04.079
Lieutenant Governor
and Ms. Chambers

18:04.080 --> 18:06.619
are on a private assignment,
reporting directly to me.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.999
If they're incommunicado...

18:08.000 --> 18:10.119
Because?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.039
They traveled to one
of the Outer Islands.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.539
No flight plan was allowed?

18:13.540 --> 18:15.120
They went by boat.

18:20.710 --> 18:23.749
The initial tip from the Thais
came from Dylan Sawyer's people.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.829
You sent Cat and Ana
to an isolated island

18:26.830 --> 18:28.169
without backup,

18:28.170 --> 18:29.709
drug runners
start flooding the waters,

18:29.710 --> 18:31.499
and you don't tell anyone?

18:31.500 --> 18:32.959
I have every confidence
in my st...

18:32.960 --> 18:34.540
For God's sakes.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.539
That is not the company
you want to keep, Detective.

18:40.540 --> 18:42.539
It's my sister out there.

18:42.540 --> 18:44.249
And your lover?

18:44.250 --> 18:45.879
Diverting department resources

18:45.880 --> 18:47.959
from a drug bust
to a girlfriend rescue

18:47.960 --> 18:50.539
is not a good look, Detective.

18:50.540 --> 18:52.380
Small island.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.540
Looks like we're late
to the party.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.329
Dylan lied.

19:16.330 --> 19:17.879
He is expanding his empire.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.249
No. No way.
I've known Dylan a long time.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.290
He would never get caught up
in something like this.

19:22.314 --> 19:23.709
You sure about that?

19:23.710 --> 19:25.270
Those crates don't look
like fertilizer.

19:30.790 --> 19:32.619
It doesn't make any sense.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.039
Let me ask you something.

19:34.040 --> 19:36.459
Who asked for this meeting...
You or Dylan?

19:36.460 --> 19:39.289
Dylan... Well, Beau.

19:39.290 --> 19:42.329
Beau asked for the meeting?

19:42.330 --> 19:44.419
Let me ask you another question.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.959
Do you get the sense
that Dylan would let Beau

19:46.960 --> 19:48.459
have that kind of
responsibility,

19:48.460 --> 19:51.499
or any kind of responsibility,
for that matter?

19:51.500 --> 19:52.830
You think Beau has daddy issues?

19:59.790 --> 20:01.790
Yeah.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.419
Yeah. And we don't want to
be here when they come our way.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.830
Let's go. Come on!

20:14.170 --> 20:15.959
We got to get out there.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.249
Air and Sea are on
the other end of the Chain.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.919
Even if we divert units
to pick us up,

20:18.920 --> 20:20.440
or even if they get there
without us...

20:20.441 --> 20:21.761
Do you think
that's a coincidence?

20:21.785 --> 20:22.619
No!

20:22.620 --> 20:24.180
Whatever's happening
on Sawyer's island,

20:24.204 --> 20:25.539
this is part of the plan.

20:25.540 --> 20:27.249
Sawyer's got, what,
maybe 15 people?

20:27.250 --> 20:29.209
You got to figure in
drug runners, too.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.710
I mean, if they're after...

20:32.960 --> 20:34.879
She doesn't...

20:34.880 --> 20:37.540
We've got to grab a boat,
any guns we can muster.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.420
I have a better idea.

20:51.120 --> 20:52.789
We need a plan.

20:52.790 --> 20:55.669
Well, you know,
I'm more of a fan

20:55.670 --> 20:59.499
of waiting things out
and seeing who comes out on top.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.119
You would be.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.619
Okay, there it is again.

21:02.620 --> 21:04.169
There is what again?

21:04.170 --> 21:06.209
That... That
unmotivated anger thing.

21:06.210 --> 21:08.459
You know your brother's
a grown man, right?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.879
I can't help it if we have
an intense sexual connection.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.999
Thank you for that.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.959
You really think I care
about the two of you?

21:15.960 --> 21:18.919
Okay, well, why else
would you be so... angry?

21:18.920 --> 21:22.079
I mean, to be fair,
I did save your life.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.249
You mean 20 seconds
before I saved yours?

21:24.250 --> 21:26.079
Well, yeah, that's a good point.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.289
Thank you for that, by the way.

21:28.290 --> 21:31.079
Why are they not looking for us?

21:31.080 --> 21:32.720
If they wanted us here,
I mean, I don't...

21:32.744 --> 21:34.669
Beau wants you here.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.460
He has what he wanted.

21:38.620 --> 21:39.879
My phones.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.289
Your phones?

21:41.290 --> 21:43.619
If Beau's converting
a pot farm into a drug lab,

21:43.620 --> 21:45.669
he must have a plan
for keeping the law at bay.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.590
Well, what does that have to do
with your phones?

21:47.614 --> 21:50.039
A direct hack into the
Governor's private servers,

21:50.040 --> 21:52.709
access to privileged
communications, leverage.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.749
Just how crooked is your boss?

21:54.750 --> 21:56.749
Crooked enough to get
things done on the Reef.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.669
Not so crooked that
I can't get up every morning

21:58.670 --> 22:00.499
and go work for him.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.790
You coming?

22:12.750 --> 22:15.169
As you can see, Mr. Eastland
has generously agreed

22:15.170 --> 22:17.249
to lend you a security detail.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.709
Whoa. That's a lot of hardware
for an oil company.

22:20.710 --> 22:22.879
We'll need you to sign
where indicated.

22:22.880 --> 22:23.959
For?

22:23.960 --> 22:25.709
Liability.

22:25.710 --> 22:27.950
You're worried we're gonna
break one of your helicopters?

22:27.974 --> 22:29.249
Not our liability... yours.

22:29.250 --> 22:31.829
That all it says? We won't
blame you if we fall out?

22:31.830 --> 22:34.879
Any subsequent goodwill would be
strictly off the record.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.119
Right. Meaning you
can't ask for favors,

22:37.120 --> 22:38.579
but you sure expect them.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.880
You came to us.

22:44.080 --> 22:45.499
Let's mount up.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.749
- You two with me.
- Roger that.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.379
I know this was my idea,

22:48.380 --> 22:50.420
but why does it feel like
we're selling our souls?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.749
You really aced
that balcony drop.

23:01.750 --> 23:03.039
And that Krav Maga?

23:03.040 --> 23:04.879
Yes, someone
other than Cat Chambers

23:04.880 --> 23:06.209
possesses a skill set.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.379
Wow, that came out of left field.
Did it?

23:08.380 --> 23:10.289
Yeah. Is there something
you want to talk about?

23:10.290 --> 23:12.119
Not at the moment, no.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.440
Just seems like...
I don't know...

23:13.464 --> 23:14.919
We're being hunted
through the jungle

23:14.920 --> 23:16.289
by drug-running gunmen.

23:16.290 --> 23:18.119
This really seem like the time?

23:18.120 --> 23:21.080
Except we're not, though.
Where are they?

23:22.620 --> 23:24.709
Maybe we're not the center
of their universe.

23:24.710 --> 23:27.709
Okay, there it is again.
Another thinly veiled insult.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.380
The boat's this way.

23:40.960 --> 23:42.959
Where would they
keep our phones?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.459
Probably in Dylan's den.

23:45.460 --> 23:48.249
There's a wall safe there
behind the Gauguin.

23:48.250 --> 23:52.459
From the footprint, I'd say
it's a Rexfield 383 or 385.

23:52.460 --> 23:54.379
You saw all of that
walking through?

23:54.380 --> 23:57.119
Yeah, well, old habits die hard.

23:57.120 --> 23:58.749
Rexfields have a four-digit code

23:58.750 --> 24:00.919
with a light-up keypad
that loves grease.

24:00.920 --> 24:02.840
I want you to look
for the four greasiest numbers

24:02.864 --> 24:04.329
and start working the combos.

24:04.330 --> 24:06.419
Why are you telling me
all of this?

24:06.420 --> 24:07.860
'Cause I don't plan
on getting killed

24:07.884 --> 24:09.249
for your three phones?

24:09.250 --> 24:11.329
I'm gonna find a way
off this island.

24:11.330 --> 24:13.079
You're leaving me here?

24:13.080 --> 24:15.240
When you get in there,
I want you to look for powder...

24:15.264 --> 24:17.379
Talcum powder, baby powder,
any kind of powder,

24:17.380 --> 24:19.249
and I want you
to lightly dust those keys

24:19.250 --> 24:20.690
for fingerprints, alright?
Seriously?

24:20.691 --> 24:21.811
If you want your phone back,

24:21.835 --> 24:24.209
yeah, very seriously.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.380
And good luck, by the way.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.500
You know we've got cameras,
right?

25:35.460 --> 25:37.329
You know it's illegal to
drive in this country

25:37.330 --> 25:39.619
without a seatbelt, right?

25:39.620 --> 25:41.170
Let's go!

25:59.080 --> 26:01.120
Let's go, let's go!

26:07.250 --> 26:09.209
On me, let's go!

26:09.210 --> 26:11.710
On me!

26:50.500 --> 26:52.669
Wya How do they figure
they'll hold the island?

26:52.670 --> 26:55.039
Well, the same island a pot
dealer's held for 20 years

26:55.040 --> 26:56.289
with half a dozen bodyguards.

26:56.290 --> 26:58.749
They'll be heaviest
at the air strip.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.499
We hit them hard and fast,
get control of the situation,

27:01.500 --> 27:03.079
and then we come back
for the hostages.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.361
Right, except they've got
the Lieutenant Governor in there

27:05.385 --> 27:06.459
and probably Cat.

27:06.460 --> 27:07.749
So?

27:07.750 --> 27:09.999
Well, if we make
that much noise,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
we get them all killed.

27:15.670 --> 27:16.960
Alright.

27:32.920 --> 27:36.879
Man, Cambridge
was a bad investment.

27:36.880 --> 27:39.249
You wouldn't listen, Dad.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.539
Weed is legal
in more and more markets.

27:41.540 --> 27:43.419
It's only a matter of time
before Philip Morris

27:43.420 --> 27:45.209
and Altria jump in
and price us out.

27:45.210 --> 27:47.709
We diversify or we die.

27:47.710 --> 27:50.039
Kidnapping
the Lieutenant Governor?

27:50.040 --> 27:51.619
That's your business plan?!

27:51.620 --> 27:53.499
You really think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

27:53.500 --> 27:55.790
Every idea I have,
you just blow me off.

27:57.250 --> 28:00.710
Well, now I've got the guns,
and I'm calling the shots.

28:19.500 --> 28:22.749
Team Two, we got two vehicles
coming your way.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.919
Should be at the airfield in 5.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.789
Obviously,
you have a plan, Beau,

28:29.790 --> 28:34.289
and you're smart enough not
to hold hostages indefinitely.

28:34.290 --> 28:36.770
If you want me to, I can relay
your objectives to the Governor.

28:36.794 --> 28:37.829
When the time is right.

28:37.830 --> 28:39.539
When's the going to be?

28:39.540 --> 28:42.329
Maybe when this guy
tells Beau...

28:42.330 --> 28:44.500
exactly what
those objectives are.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.959
The ball's in your court, Beau.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.999
But see this vine
wrapped around his neck?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.879
It's called
a dead man's trigger.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.709
You shoot me,
your boss dies, as well.

28:59.710 --> 29:00.919
He's not my boss.

29:00.920 --> 29:03.619
- Beau. Look, listen.
- Dylan, any hope we have

29:03.620 --> 29:04.980
of getting out of here
in one piece

29:05.004 --> 29:06.964
includes you not telling
your son what to do.

29:12.710 --> 29:14.710
You two, go, go, go.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.880
Hey, on me.

29:28.380 --> 29:31.329
Beau, you're the one in this
room that has the advantage.

29:31.330 --> 29:33.459
We saw the two of you
on the airfield.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.209
He respects you.

29:35.210 --> 29:37.539
Tell him to get on the radio

29:37.540 --> 29:39.980
and tell his crew to get on that
plane and get off the island.

29:40.004 --> 29:40.710
We'll let him go!

29:40.711 --> 29:42.249
Beau, look at me.

29:42.250 --> 29:43.919
I've known you
since you were a kid,

29:43.920 --> 29:45.209
and I've spent all of my life

29:45.210 --> 29:46.959
dancing on the wrong side
of the law.

29:46.960 --> 29:48.379
So, trust me when I say

29:48.380 --> 29:52.419
the guy you deal with
is never the guy.

29:52.420 --> 29:53.749
Now, tell these girls
to put their weapons down

29:53.750 --> 29:54.879
and get out of here.

29:54.880 --> 29:57.460
Irma, you should go.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.000
You speak Thai?

31:03.580 --> 31:05.959
Where the hell are they?

31:05.960 --> 31:08.829
Copy that. Team Two says they've
just started up their plane.

31:08.830 --> 31:10.510
She must be with...
They must be with them.

31:10.511 --> 31:12.431
Tell them to stop the plane,
but don't open fire.

31:12.455 --> 31:13.744
We have to stop that plane.

31:25.500 --> 31:28.959
Well, hey, fellas.

31:28.960 --> 31:32.210
What are you guys doing here?

31:34.330 --> 31:35.789
Rescuing you.

31:35.790 --> 31:38.209
Sure.

31:38.210 --> 31:40.999
Okay. Well, thanks.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.539
Listen, that guy over there,

31:42.540 --> 31:44.329
he's some big international
drug dealer

31:44.330 --> 31:45.829
who tried
to take over the island.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.910
I told him we'd let him go
if he played ball with us,

31:47.934 --> 31:48.829
but I lied.

31:48.830 --> 31:50.749
So, I'd really like you
to prosecute him

31:50.750 --> 31:52.039
to the full extent of the law.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.240
You know what I'm saying? I...

31:53.264 --> 31:54.433
You're a good man.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.499
We're just gonna meet
with the...

32:02.500 --> 32:04.829
Okay, let's get him out of here.

32:04.830 --> 32:06.330
Absolutely.

32:08.330 --> 32:12.999
I've survived this long
not holding grudges.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.750
Maybe...

32:15.500 --> 32:19.500
Obviously, I've made mistakes.

32:21.500 --> 32:23.500
But not like this.

32:25.460 --> 32:26.460
Dad...

32:26.461 --> 32:27.669
Don't worry.

32:27.670 --> 32:30.880
Your trust fund
should pay for your lawyer.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.040
Hey.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.170
Hey.

32:47.210 --> 32:49.459
Are you okay?

32:49.460 --> 32:52.040
When Beau was a kid,
he wanted to be a veterinarian.

32:53.799 --> 32:56.039
And then, growing up here
in the middle of all of this...

32:56.040 --> 32:58.419
Hey, look at me.

32:58.420 --> 33:00.919
No regrets.

33:00.920 --> 33:03.419
You did the best you could,
alright?

33:03.420 --> 33:06.079
Wasn't good enough, apparently.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.709
You're a good father, Dylan.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.039
You are.

33:10.040 --> 33:12.789
And... and Beau
made a stupid mistake

33:12.790 --> 33:16.749
that, hopefully,
he'll learn from.

33:16.750 --> 33:19.419
My gosh, don't you remember
all the mistakes we made?

33:19.420 --> 33:22.209
Yeah.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.079
Remember when I sent you to Maui

33:24.080 --> 33:25.789
with Anemone Red in your bag?

33:25.790 --> 33:27.709
You got so high,

33:27.710 --> 33:30.789
you missed your heat because you
were building a sand castle.

33:30.790 --> 33:33.959
I stand behind your product.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.680
So, do I get, like,
a free unlimited supply?

33:35.704 --> 33:36.864
Absolutely.

33:38.170 --> 33:40.789
Cat...

33:40.790 --> 33:42.919
Thank you.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.420
Sure.

33:45.830 --> 33:47.710
I'll take this with me, okay?

33:51.040 --> 33:52.539
My advice?

33:52.540 --> 33:54.539
Take The Chemist and Beau
and call it a day.

33:54.540 --> 33:55.709
Me? What about your...

33:55.710 --> 33:58.040
I got what I came for.

33:59.290 --> 34:01.499
Alright. You heard the man.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.289
Let 'em fly.

34:03.290 --> 34:06.959
Today, you saw the reality of
having Mr. Eastland as an ally.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.918
You can avail yourself
of the opportunity...

34:09.920 --> 34:11.710
or not.

34:14.330 --> 34:15.829
It's the tail number
of an airplane

34:15.830 --> 34:17.579
held by a shell corporation.

34:17.580 --> 34:19.918
You run it and text me
the details of the owner,

34:19.920 --> 34:24.120
and we are at the onset of a
mutually fruitful relationship.

34:25.500 --> 34:26.879
And if I don't?

34:26.880 --> 34:28.958
You won't see us again.

34:28.960 --> 34:31.500
Whether your helicopters
are available or not.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.579
You knew that
I would get caught?

35:01.580 --> 35:04.039
I knew.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.329
Listen, I needed you
to keep Beau busy

35:06.330 --> 35:08.119
once I figured out there
was a bigger dog

35:08.120 --> 35:09.579
running the whole operation.

35:09.580 --> 35:12.079
I figured he was here checking
out his new pot fields.

35:12.080 --> 35:14.119
What I didn't know is where
he was holding Dylan,

35:14.120 --> 35:15.879
and they walked me right there.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.789
Am I just supposed to be
okay with all of that?

35:17.790 --> 35:19.499
That's up to you.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.919
If you think it could've
worked out any better.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.499
I don't know if
there was a better way

35:23.500 --> 35:25.379
any of this could've turned out.

35:25.380 --> 35:27.579
Is that a "thank you"?

35:27.580 --> 35:30.000
It's as close as
I feel myself getting.

35:31.790 --> 35:32.879
Bring it in for a hug...

35:32.880 --> 35:35.250
or a handshake.

35:51.290 --> 35:54.619
How did you get
Carter Eastland to help?

35:54.620 --> 35:56.249
I asked.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.039
That's it? You just asked?

35:58.040 --> 36:00.709
You'd be surprised how far
you can get just asking nicely.

36:00.710 --> 36:01.999
Really?

36:02.000 --> 36:04.379
Hey, your, um... your ex.

36:04.380 --> 36:05.789
When you went missing,
he went nuts.

36:05.790 --> 36:06.959
Really?

36:06.960 --> 36:08.499
Threatened to physically assault

36:08.500 --> 36:09.500
the Governor, actually.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.209
Well...

36:11.210 --> 36:13.379
that's the old Jake I knew.

36:13.380 --> 36:15.829
That's kind of my point.

36:15.830 --> 36:17.290
He's not over you, Cat.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.790
No, maybe not.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.119
Look...

36:27.120 --> 36:30.169
When you go through
what Jake and I went through,

36:30.170 --> 36:33.539
you don't just
get over each other.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.749
You know?

36:34.750 --> 36:36.709
You...

36:36.710 --> 36:38.829
hopefully move forward.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.710
Meaning... you?

36:43.710 --> 36:46.040
Meaning me.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.289
And if Jake hasn't figured out
a way to move forward,

36:51.290 --> 36:54.579
then, you know, he'll have to...

36:54.580 --> 36:56.750
He'll have to deal with that.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.000
I'll take that.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.039
You know...

37:04.040 --> 37:06.240
I think we should still get
some credit for that rescue.

37:06.264 --> 37:07.169
Really?

37:07.170 --> 37:08.459
We threatened the Governor.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.169
Yeah, Jake
threatened the Governor.

37:10.170 --> 37:11.080
Yeah, but I backed his play.

37:11.081 --> 37:12.750
You're a badass.

37:29.710 --> 37:33.039
Your running mate
nearly got you killed.

37:33.040 --> 37:36.169
He would've let you die
just to protect himself.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.420
Well, he is a known quantity.

37:40.210 --> 37:43.289
And for the moment,
my necessary evil.

37:43.290 --> 37:46.079
Yeah, well,
back in my sunnier days,

37:46.080 --> 37:50.959
I'd have said that
no evil is necessary.

37:50.960 --> 37:52.619
But now not so sunny,

37:52.620 --> 37:53.999
It's getting brighter again.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.119
When I saw you today,

37:56.120 --> 37:58.460
it was all I could do
not to just grab hold of you.

38:00.670 --> 38:02.580
Me, too.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.170
I nearly told Cat.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.999
So, maybe...

38:23.000 --> 38:26.209
this is not as casual
as we keep saying it is?

38:26.210 --> 38:28.749
Maybe.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.120
Just maybe, though.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.619
Even before Cat got here,
this was tricky.

38:36.620 --> 38:37.919
And now it's just...

38:37.920 --> 38:39.959
I was worried about you.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.000
Because you knew
Cat could handle herself.

38:56.790 --> 38:58.459
What?

38:58.460 --> 39:00.289
You get hot intel
on drug runners...

39:00.290 --> 39:02.499
Which turned out to be a ruse.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.709
And you gave your brother
the tip, not me?

39:04.710 --> 39:07.579
Wyatt's career still has a shot.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.620
Come here.
