00:03.378 --> 00:04.921
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.004 --> 00:08.425
- YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THE TEXT
MESSAGE MITCH JUST SENT ME.

00:08.508 --> 00:12.387
AND TELL ME THERE'S NOT
A YEARNING SEXUAL UNDERTONE.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.264
- "THAT THAI FOOD WE HAD
FOR LUNCH

00:14.347 --> 00:16.474
GAVE ME AN UPSET STOMACH."

00:18.476 --> 00:20.270
- HE'S THINKING ABOUT MY BODY.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.772
- MM.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.108
- OH, I KNOW I'M REACHING,

00:25.191 --> 00:27.902
BUT IT'S THE WARMEST TEXT
HE'S EVER SENT ME.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.739
WE'RE FRIENDS, BUT I WANT
TO BE MORE THAN FRIENDS.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.949
I WANT TO BE NAKED FRIENDS.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.284
WHAT DO I DO?

00:34.367 --> 00:37.120
- I SAY WE HAVE SOME COFFEE
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.788
JOY, YOUR NONFAT LATTE,

00:38.872 --> 00:41.958
NONFAT MACCHIATO
FOR VICTORIA, AND...

00:42.041 --> 00:46.421
HA, ONCE AGAIN "MELODY'S"
BLACK COFFEE HAS FULL FAT CREAM.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.797
THEY NEVER GET MY ORDER RIGHT!

00:47.881 --> 00:49.799
- OR YOUR NAME.
WHY DON'T YOU COMPLAIN?

00:49.883 --> 00:51.634
- OH, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T COMPLAIN TO ANYONE.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.472
- DO WE? YOU'RE COMPLAINING
TO US RIGHT NOW.

00:55.555 --> 00:58.308
BUT I KNOW WHAT WILL MAKE BOTH
OF YOUR PROBLEMS

00:58.391 --> 01:00.101
SEEM SILLY
AND INSIGNIFICANT.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.479
MY PROBLEMS.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.938
I AM SUDDENLY TOO IN-DEMAND
AS AN ACTRESS.

01:05.022 --> 01:07.400
I DON'T KNOW WHICH
OF THESE SCRIPTS TO CHOOSE.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.818
I MEAN, THE NEXT PROJECT
YOU PICK

01:08.902 --> 01:10.987
AFTER AN OSCAR NOMINATION
IS CRUCIAL.

01:11.070 --> 01:13.823
- SHUT...UP.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.284
- WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
ARE GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE

01:16.367 --> 01:17.619
WITH THAT COMPLAINING THING.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.829
- NO, NO.
LOOK AT YOUR COFFEE SLEEVES.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.291
- WHAT?

01:23.374 --> 01:27.629
<i>"THE DEVIL'S DUE,</i> AN ORIGINAL
PLAY BY ELKA OSTROVSKY"?

01:27.712 --> 01:29.839
- COULD THIS BE
OUR ELKA OSTROVSKY?

01:29.923 --> 01:32.634
- PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.178
- ARE WE SO SELF-INVOLVED
THAT WE HAVEN'T NOTICED

01:35.261 --> 01:37.180
THAT SOMEONE LIVING IN OUR HOUSE
HAS WRITTEN, DIRECTED,

01:37.263 --> 01:38.890
AND PRODUCED A PLAY?

01:38.973 --> 01:41.059
- YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
QUESTIONS THAT BEGIN WITH

01:41.142 --> 01:44.354
"ARE WE SO SELF-INVOLVED."

01:44.437 --> 01:46.064
THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS YES.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.690
- OH, HERE WE GO.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.317
LISTEN TO THIS.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.319
THE CLEVELAND <i> PLAIN DEALER</i>
CALLS ELKA'S PLAY

01:51.402 --> 01:52.987
"HILARIOUS AND INSIGHTFUL."

01:53.071 --> 01:56.533
THERE'S A MATINEE PERFORMANCE
IN 20 MINUTES.

02:01.913 --> 02:03.665
- [chuckles]
IT'S ELKA.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.000
- "WHEN I WAS A YOUNG GIRL
IN POLAND,

THAT I WOULD GIVE UP ANYTHING

"IF MY FAMILY AND I
COULD ESCAPE.

"A SHADOWY FIGURE CAME

"BUT THERE WAS
A PRICE ATTACHED.

IS THIS PLAY ABOUT US?

[knock at door]

02:40.368 --> 02:43.246
- WELCOME.

OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THIS PLACE!
I'M MOVING TO CLEVELAND.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.086
IT'S ALL SO EXCITING,
BECAUSE WE'RE STILL HOT HERE--

SO HOT.

02:51.671 --> 02:56.384
WE'RE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL AGAIN,
AND WE CAN PASS FOR 25.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.719
[audience laughing]

02:57.802 --> 03:00.889
- WHY ARE THEY LAUGHING?

03:00.972 --> 03:03.224
- AM I TALKING TOO MUCH?
SOME PEOPLE SAY I TALK TOO MUCH.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.602
DO YOU THINK I TALK TOO MUCH?
I DON'T THINK I TALK TOO MUCH.

03:05.685 --> 03:09.564
- DO I TALK LIKE THAT?
I DON'T THINK I TALK LIKE THAT.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.274
- AND IF I AM TALKING TOO MUCH,

03:11.357 --> 03:13.610
IT'S BECAUSE I REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY NEED PEOPLE TO LIKE ME.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.863
YOU LIKE ME, RIGHT?
PLEASE LIKE ME.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.493
- I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.329
MY CAREER IS IN THE TOILET,

03:24.412 --> 03:26.956
SO I'M CONSIDERING
MOVING TO CLEVELAND,

03:27.040 --> 03:30.084
THOUGH I CAN HARDLY IMAGINE
LIVING IN WISCONSIN.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.502
[audience laughing]

03:31.586 --> 03:33.463
- AGAIN, WHY ARE THEY LAUGHING?

03:33.546 --> 03:37.759
- CLEVELAND IS IN OHIO.
- ARE YOU SURE?

03:37.842 --> 03:39.969
- I WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING JOY.
- OH, HERE SHE COMES.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.305
- ALL RIGHT, JOY,
BRACE YOURSELF.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.431
EXPECT THE WORST.

03:43.514 --> 03:46.935
- [Cockney accent]
HELLO, HELLO.

03:47.018 --> 03:50.647
- DIDN'T BRACE MYSELF ENOUGH.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.857
- SORRY I'M LATE, DUCKIES,
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A FIVER,

03:52.941 --> 03:55.526
SO I HAD TO HAVE SEX
WITH ME CABBIE.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.946
OH, WOULD YOU FANCY
HAVING SEX WITH ME?

03:58.029 --> 04:01.491
YOU WON'T LEAVE ME, WILL YOU?
MOST BLOKES DO.

04:01.574 --> 04:03.952
[audience laughing]

04:04.035 --> 04:06.037
- NO ONE'S GOING TO LEAVE YOU,
BECAUSE WE'RE SO HOT HERE.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.331
SOME GUY CALLED ME "MISS,"
AND HE WASN'T ELDERLY,

04:08.414 --> 04:11.167
GAY, OR USING IT IRONICALLY.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.503
- I'M AN INGENUE AGAIN.

04:13.586 --> 04:16.673
[audience laughing]

04:16.755 --> 04:20.134
- SOME CHAP CALLED ME
"CUTIE PIE," HE DID. HE DID!

04:20.218 --> 04:24.055
BUT THEN HE NOTICED ME BIG HANDS
AND SAID, "SORRY, MISTER."

04:24.138 --> 04:26.015
I HAD SEX WITH HIM ANYWAYS.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.059
- CAN WE PLEASE CHANGE
THE SUBJECT TO ME,

04:28.142 --> 04:29.352
THE FAMOUS ACTRESS?

04:29.435 --> 04:32.021

04:32.105 --> 04:34.649
- ARE YOU FAMOUS?
- YES, VERY.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.566
I'M A SOAP OPERA ACTRESS.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.486

COMES WITH A CARETAKER.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.290
ELKA, COULD YOU COME IN HERE
FOR A MOMENT?

04:55.753 --> 04:58.589
- WHY ARE YOU RENTING
TO PROSTITUTES?

{\an8}- YOU WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.945
{\an8}- I'M BEING PLAYED BY A MAN!

05:22.530 --> 05:24.741
{\an8}- HE WAS THE ONLY ACTOR
WITH A FLAT-ENOUGH CHEST

05:24.824 --> 05:26.534
{\an8}AND BIG-ENOUGH HANDS.

05:28.703 --> 05:30.455
{\an8}- THIS PLAY IS SLANDER!

05:30.538 --> 05:33.916
{\an8}- THE CRITICS DISAGREE.

IS A ROLLER-COASTER RIDE.

TO STAY FOR THAT.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.597
{\an8}- OH, WE'RE LEAVING.
- GOOD.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.058
{\an8}I'VE GOT TO GO SEE MY ACTORS.

05:50.141 --> 05:53.102
{\an8}THEY WANT TO DISCUSS
THEIR CHARACTERS.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.771
{\an8}- AND WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

05:54.854 --> 05:59.025
{\an8}- IF GOD WANTED ACTORS TO THINK,
HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM BRAINS.

06:00.568 --> 06:04.530
{\an8}- YOU REALIZE I'M AN ACTOR.
- I DO.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.912
- WHAT'S OUR RECOURSE HERE?
THIS IS SO HUMILIATING.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.330
SHE GOT US ALL WRONG!

06:12.413 --> 06:14.791
- ELKA EXAGGERATED ALL OF US,
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.

06:14.874 --> 06:16.667
SHE DID THE WORST HATCHET JOB
ON ME.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.795
SHE MADE ME SOUND
LIKE A BABBLING WIMP.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.797
- SHE CALLED ME EGOTISTICAL
AND CONCEITED.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.342
ME, ME, ME!

06:24.425 --> 06:26.928
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT EITHER
OF YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.513
I'M THE ONE
BEING PLAYED BY A MAN!

06:28.596 --> 06:30.098
- ALL RIGHT, NOW, LOOK,

06:30.181 --> 06:33.309
ARGUING AMONGST OURSELVES
ISN'T GOING TO FIX ANYTHING.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.685
NOW, IF WE CAN'T CHANGE
THE WRITING,

06:34.769 --> 06:35.853
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MEET
WITH THE ACTORS

06:35.937 --> 06:38.022
AND CHANGE THE ACTING.
- YES.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.190
MY CHARACTER
SHOULD BE LESS WIMPY.

06:39.273 --> 06:41.150
- AND MINE LESS SELF-CENTERED.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.028
- BUT HOW EXACTLY
WILL I FIX MINE?

06:44.112 --> 06:47.073
I'M BEING PLAYED BY A MAN...

06:47.156 --> 06:51.786
WHOSE SHORTS ARE SO SHORT,
HIS JUNK IS SHOWING.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.288
- WELL, THEY ARE
YOUR SHORTS, JOY.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.999
- I KNOW.

07:01.712 --> 07:02.839
- I JUST THOUGHT
BY KNOWING ME BETTER,

07:02.922 --> 07:06.509
YOUR PORTRAYAL OF ME, WHICH IS,
OF COURSE, GREAT ALREADY,

07:06.592 --> 07:07.802
COULD BE EVEN GREATER.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.680
SO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
- I DO.

07:10.763 --> 07:14.058
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TALK ELKA
INTO GIVING ME A BETTER PART?

07:14.142 --> 07:17.228
- WHAT?
BUT YOU'RE PLAYING MELANIE.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.688
EVERYBODY LIKES MELANIE.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.065
SHE'S THE GLUE THAT KEEPS
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.318
- WHO WANTS TO PLAY GLUE?
IT'S WHITE AND BLAND AND DRIPPY.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.571
- AND PERKY.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.364
- LOOK, DON'T TAKE
THIS PERSONALLY.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.867
THIS PLAY IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE
EXAGGERATION OF WHO YOU ARE.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.034
- THANK YOU.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.954
- I MEAN, NO ONE COULD BE
THAT MUCH OF A PATHETIC WUSS.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.248
- YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
THE REAL MELANIE MORETTI--

07:37.331 --> 07:39.709
SHE STANDS UP FOR HERSELF
ALL THE TIME.

07:39.792 --> 07:42.170
- HERE'S YOUR LATTE.

07:42.253 --> 07:46.382
AND, MELODY, HERE'S
YOUR CHAI MINT-ACCINO.

07:46.465 --> 07:47.633
- THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ORDERED.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.051
WHY DIDN'T YOU COMPLAIN
AND SEND IT BACK?

07:49.135 --> 07:51.554
OH, MY GOD.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.015
YOU ARE THAT BIG
OF A PATHETIC WUSS.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.601
- NO, I'M AN OPTIMIST.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.769
I, UH--
I MAY END UP LIKING THIS DRINK

07:58.853 --> 08:00.771
EVEN MORE THAN
WHAT I ORIGINALLY ORDERED.

08:00.855 --> 08:04.108
AND THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT LIFE.
I SEE THE GLASS AS HALF FULL.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.652
- I SEE IT AS ALL THE WAY FULL
OF CRAP YOU DON'T WANT.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.949
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.035
- SO GOOD.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.831
- OH, ELIZABETH,
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.250
- VICTORIA.
- YES.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.754
- MY NAME IS VICTORIA.
VICTORIA CHASE.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.923
AND UNTIL THIS PLAY
COMES TO AN END,

08:27.006 --> 08:30.092
THIS ELIZABETH PERSON YOU SPEAK
OF WILL CEASE TO EXIST.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.636
- WELL, I CAN'T HELP
BUT RESPECT YOUR PROCESS.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.597
- THANK YOU.
- NO, THANK YOU.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.265
{\an5}- THANK YOU.
- NO, THANK YOU.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.433
- THANK YOU.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.684
AND SCENE.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.734
- LOOK, THE WAY THE OTHERS
ARE PORTRAYED,

08:46.817 --> 08:49.111
IT--IT DOESN'T MATTER,
THEY'RE NON-PROS.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.615
BUT FOR ME, HOW I'M PORTRAYED
COULD INFLUENCE

08:52.698 --> 08:53.991
THE WAY I'M SEEN
BY OSCAR VOTERS.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.493
- YES.

08:55.576 --> 08:57.411
EVERYTHING I DO RIGHT NOW
MUST BE CALCULATED

08:57.495 --> 08:58.829
TO GET MY NEXT ACCOLADE.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.289
- WOW.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.960
YOU REALLY DO KNOW ME.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.962
UH, LISTEN, VICTORIA,

09:06.045 --> 09:08.256
THERE IS SOMETHING
YOU COULD HELP ME WITH.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.383
I HAVE THIS PILE OF SCRIPTS

09:10.466 --> 09:12.301
THAT I HAVE TO CHOOSE
MY NEXT PROJECT FROM--

09:12.385 --> 09:15.972
- AND I MUST CHOOSE THE EXACT
RIGHT ONE TO PROPEL MY CAREER

09:16.055 --> 09:17.348
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.059
I NEED TO USE BRIBERY,
BLACKMAIL, ANYTHING IT TAKES

09:20.142 --> 09:22.812
TO GET THE ROLE
EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.231
- I-I'M NOT SURE
I WOULD DO ALL THAT.

09:25.314 --> 09:27.483
- YES, I WOULD.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.777
- NO, BUT--BUT
DON'T WE WANT A PART

09:29.860 --> 09:32.321
THAT WE COULD REALLY
BE GOOD IN?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.032
I'M SO PROUD OF THE WORK THAT
I DID IN <i> CLEVELAND RHAPSODY,</i>

09:35.116 --> 09:37.201
AND I'D JUST REALLY LIKE
TO CONTINUE TO DO GOOD WORK.

09:37.285 --> 09:40.621
- "GOOD WORK"?
THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.456
IT'S THE AWARDS THAT MATTER.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.667
I'D SACRIFICE ANYTHING--

09:44.750 --> 09:47.753
MY RELATIONSHIPS, MY FRIENDS,
MY TWO CHILDREN.

09:47.837 --> 09:51.132
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MANY CHILDREN WE HAVE!

09:51.215 --> 09:54.343
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
IT'S THREE.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.512
AND I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU'RE ACTING.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.724
YOU'RE MAKING ME SEEM
SELFISH AND--AND UNLIKABLE.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.517
- ISN'T THAT
WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR?

10:01.600 --> 10:02.518
- NO.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.812
LOOK, I WANT YOU TO GO.

10:04.895 --> 10:07.648
- ALL RIGHT, I'M LEAVING, BUT
NOT WITHOUT MAKING A SCENE

10:07.732 --> 10:09.859
AND SLAMMING THE DOOR.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.528
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE MOVED
TO KENTUCKY!

10:16.782 --> 10:19.201
- CLEVELAND IS IN OHIO,
YOU IDIOT.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.953
KENTUCKY IS IN INDIANA.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.045
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.714
I'M JOY, JOY SCROGGS.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.549
- I'M JAY, JAY GREPPS.

10:33.632 --> 10:37.386
I-I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE PLAYING JOY.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.389
{\an1}- WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT--
- I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.183
IN MANY WAYS,
WE'RE A LOT ALIKE.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.352
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T KEEP A MAN,
AND I CAN'T KEEP A WOMAN.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.437
YET, WE HAVE
THIS FAIRY-TALE VIEW

10:46.520 --> 10:48.939
THAT TRUE LOVE IS OUT THERE.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.567
WE MAY BE BITTER AND CYNICAL
ABOUT IT.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.278
- I HAVE BEEN KNOWN
TO BE BITTER.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.947
- BUT THERE'S
A SADNESS BEHIND IT.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.159
FOR ME, I THINK IT STEMS FROM
BEING ABANDONED BY MY MOTHER.

11:00.242 --> 11:02.912
- I WAS ABANDONED BY MY FATHER.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.415
IT'S MADE ME MISTRUSTFUL,
SOMETIMES EVEN VINDICTIVE.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.084
- ME TOO.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.044
[both chuckle]

11:10.127 --> 11:13.130
HOW MANY RESTRAINING ORDERS
HAVE YOU HAD AGAINST YOU?

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
LET'S ANSWER AT THE SAME TIME.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.259
both: SEVEN.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.677
[both laugh]

11:18.761 --> 11:21.972
both: ACTUALLY, NINE.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.266
- WOW.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.685
- WOW.

11:29.188 --> 11:31.107
- ARE YOU RIPPING UP SCRIPTS?
- NOT QUITE.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.109
I MET WITH THE ACTRESS
WHO'S PLAYING ME,

11:33.192 --> 11:34.777
WITH THE INTENTION
OF CHANGING HER,

11:34.860 --> 11:37.154
BUT MAYBE I'M THE ONE
WHO NEEDS TO CHANGE.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.906
SO I'VE TAKEN OFF

11:38.989 --> 11:41.117
ALL THE COVER PAGES,
AND I'M GOING TO CHOOSE

11:41.200 --> 11:44.286
MY NEXT SCRIPT BASED
ON THE MATERIAL INSIDE,

11:44.370 --> 11:46.831
NOT WHAT FAMOUS NAME
MIGHT BE ON THE COVER

11:46.914 --> 11:49.291
OR WHAT AWARDS
IT MIGHT BRING ME.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.293
SORRY.
[grunts]

11:51.377 --> 11:55.297
MY THROAT JUST CLOSED UP
A LITTLE WHEN I SAID THAT.

11:55.381 --> 12:00.136
- THAT'S A GREAT IDEA, VICTORIA.
GOOD FOR YOU.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.596
AND THEY GOT
MY ORDER WRONG AGAIN.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S IT.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.850
IF YOU CAN CHANGE, SO CAN I.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.185
I AM GOING TO STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL,

12:08.269 --> 12:09.854
EVEN IF THEY DON'T LIKE ME
FOR IT.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.981
TAKE THAT, JUDGE-Y ACTRESS
PLAYING ME!

12:12.064 --> 12:14.483
DON'T TELL HER I SAID THAT.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.987
- WELL...

12:18.070 --> 12:20.698
IF IT ISN'T TWEEDLE DUM
AND TWEEDLE DUMBER.

12:25.369 --> 12:28.497
- NOT BAD, BUT IT SOUNDED
A LITTLE WRITTEN.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.916
- OH, I FELT THAT.
NOW, WHAT ABOUT THE WALK?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.256
- PUT YOUR HIPS INTO IT.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.559
- I'M JUST TRYING TO SHARPEN
MY PERFORMANCE FOR <i> DEVIL'S DUE.</i>

12:48.642 --> 12:52.271
ELKA HAS WRITTEN
SUCH A BRILLIANT PLAY.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.399
- BUT SHE MIGHT JUST HAVE
TO REWRITE HER PLAY.

12:55.483 --> 12:59.487
MELANIE AND I HAVE CHANGED.
I AM NO LONGER SELF-CENTERED.

12:59.570 --> 13:03.532
- AND I AM NO LONGER WIMPY.
- AND I AM NO LONGER LISTENING.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.285
- NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT.

13:07.786 --> 13:10.247
- [clears throat]
- HI, MELODY. YOUR USUAL?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.082
- UH, ACTUALLY,
MY NAME IS MELANIE.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.878
AND YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN
MY "USUAL" RIGHT

13:15.961 --> 13:17.880
FOR THE LAST SIX WEEKS.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.423
I JUST WANT
A MEDIUM BLACK COFFEE, NO MILK.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.758
THAT'S MY USUAL.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.259
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

13:22.343 --> 13:24.678
IDIOT!

13:24.762 --> 13:26.680
- IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- I'LL SAY THERE IS.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.224
I'VE BEEN CALLING MELANIE
THE WRONG NAME

13:28.307 --> 13:29.892
AND GIVING HER THE WRONG COFFEE
FOR SIX WEEKS.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.560
- WHAT?
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.854
- OH, IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.439
- OH, IT'S A BIG DEAL,
ALL RIGHT.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.566
WE'RE TRYING TO BE A FIRST-CLASS
COFFEE DESTINATION,

13:37.650 --> 13:40.069
AND YOU CAN'T GET THERE
WITH THIRD-CLASS SERVICE.

13:40.152 --> 13:43.906
YOU'RE FIRED, RANBERG.
HIT THE BRICKS.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.783
- NO. NO, NO,
PLEASE DON'T DO THAT.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.953
- DADDY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:49.036 --> 13:51.372
- I GOT THAT WOMAN'S
COFFEE ORDER WRONG.

13:51.455 --> 13:52.831
I'LL GET YOU A BIKE NEXT YEAR.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.920
- PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
- I HAVE TO, MELANIE.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.755
I MEAN, ARE WE SO FAR GONE

13:59.838 --> 14:02.716
AS A SOCIETY THAT THIS ONE
SIMPLE ACT OF SERVICE

14:02.800 --> 14:04.760
IS BEYOND OUR ABILITY?

14:04.843 --> 14:07.805
NOT ON MY WATCH,
NOT AT STORMI'S NEW COFFEE BAR,

14:07.888 --> 14:09.515
AND NO MATTER HOW STRESSFUL
IT CAN--

14:09.598 --> 14:12.560
[grunting]

14:12.643 --> 14:15.896
- [shrieks]

14:15.980 --> 14:19.066
- [screams]
[items clattering]

14:24.029 --> 14:27.157
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
MY COFFEE'S FINE.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.332
[crickets chirping]

14:38.544 --> 14:40.671
- JAY, BEFORE WE DO THIS,

14:40.754 --> 14:42.548
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW
THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.092
- REALLY?

14:45.175 --> 14:47.303
I WAS ABOUT TO SAY
THE VERY SAME THING.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.138
- YOU WERE?
- YES.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.599
BUT YOU GO FIRST.
- WELL...

14:51.682 --> 14:54.310
IT'S UNREQUITED, AND IT'S
PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.854
- ME TOO. IT'S SOMEBODY
WHO LIKELY HAS

14:56.937 --> 14:58.314
NO INTEREST IN ME AT ALL.
[chuckles]

14:58.397 --> 15:01.483
- AND HE'S A BAD CHOICE,
BECAUSE I WORK WITH HIM.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.652
- SHE'S MY THERAPIST!

15:03.736 --> 15:05.946
- I'VE DONE THAT AS WELL.
[both laugh]

15:06.030 --> 15:07.281
OH, GOD,
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

15:07.364 --> 15:08.991
- I KNOW.
WHAT WERE WE THINKING?

15:09.074 --> 15:11.285
I MEAN, IF WE HAD THE CHANCE,
WE'D ONLY DATE THESE PEOPLE

15:11.368 --> 15:13.370
FOR AS LONG AS WE COULD HIDE
OUR TRUE NATURES.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.707
- BUT EVENTUALLY IT WOULD
COME OUT, AND THEY'D LEAVE US.

15:16.790 --> 15:20.002
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO HIDE
ANYTHING FROM EACH OTHER.

15:20.085 --> 15:23.088
- NO. THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF US, JOY.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.176
WE HATE OURSELVES
JUST THE WAY WE ARE.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.763
AND WE'D NEVER
HAVE TO CHANGE OR--OR GROW.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.973
AND WE'D NEVER QUESTION WHETHER
WE SETTLED FOR LESS THAN LOVE,

15:33.057 --> 15:34.350
BECAUSE WE'D KNOW WE DID.

15:34.433 --> 15:39.146
OH, WE'LL BE SUSPICIOUS
AND VINDICTIVE AND NEEDY

15:39.229 --> 15:42.566
AND UNFULFILLED
UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE.

15:42.650 --> 15:45.361
OUR WEDDING VOWS
ARE PRACTICALLY WRITTEN.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.448
- [laughs]

15:49.531 --> 15:51.867
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
WITH MYSELF. I'M A NIGHTMARE.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.535
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
ANOTHER MINUTE WITH ME.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.704
- IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED.

15:55.788 --> 15:59.708
MY THOUGHTS ARE COMING
OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
- THE PROBLEM IS
HE'S TOTALLY INTO ME.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.837
HOW DO I GET RID OF HIM?

16:03.921 --> 16:05.673
[thud]

16:10.761 --> 16:13.222
- WELL, THAT'S THAT, THEN.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.684
- YES, THAT APPEARS TO BE THAT.

16:20.270 --> 16:22.898
- THE THING IS,
I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.567
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP.
I WANT TO BE WITH MITCH.

16:25.651 --> 16:29.613
SO I'VE DECIDED
TO FIGHT MY FEARS

16:29.697 --> 16:32.074
AND MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.

16:32.157 --> 16:35.744
"CAN WE MEET FOR DRINKS?

16:35.828 --> 16:39.123
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING."

16:39.206 --> 16:42.584
IF HE REJECTS ME,
HE REJECTS ME.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.129
- AND EVEN IF HE DOES,
AT LEAST YOU'VE LEARNED

16:45.212 --> 16:47.506
YOU'D RATHER BE ALONE
THAN WITH YOURSELF.

16:50.134 --> 16:53.262
- [gasps] HE SAYS, "SURE."
- THAT'S GREAT!

16:53.345 --> 16:56.223
- OH, I WANT TO ANALYZE
THAT "SURE" SO MUCH,

16:56.306 --> 16:59.601
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO.
[laughs]

16:59.685 --> 17:03.105
THAT SAID, HE RESPONDED VERY
QUICKLY AND IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.565
LET'S GO TO THE BAR
AND CELEBRATE.

17:04.647 --> 17:06.275
- YES, BUT NOT STORMI'S.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.236
I-I HAVE TO AVOID THAT PLACE
FOR A WHILE.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.570
- WHY?

17:10.654 --> 17:12.406
- BECAUSE I LEARNED
A LESSON TOO.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.325
WHEN I COMPLAIN,
PEOPLE ALMOST DIE--MANY PEOPLE.

17:15.409 --> 17:17.077
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:17.161 --> 17:20.122
I AM THE WAY THAT I AM,
AND I LIKE IT.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.957
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
I PROBABLY WON'T SAY ANYTHING

17:22.040 --> 17:24.126
'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO LIKE ME.
- WELL, I LIKE YOU.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.127
- ME TOO.
- THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:26.211 --> 17:28.088
I THINK THE WORLD NEEDS
MORE PEOPLE LIKE ME.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.631
PEOPLE THAT ACT NICE,
EVEN WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.175
JUST SO THAT NICENESS
IS IN THE AIR.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
AND I'M DOING THAT THING
WHERE I TALK TOO MUCH, AREN'T I?

17:33.343 --> 17:35.971
- YEAH.
- WELL, I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.639
AFTER READING
ALL OF THESE SCRIPTS

17:37.723 --> 17:38.807
AND NOT KNOWING
WHO WROTE THEM

17:38.891 --> 17:40.642
OR WHAT STUDIO
IS BEHIND THEM,

17:40.726 --> 17:42.936
I'VE CHOSEN MY FAVORITE.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.981
IT'S A CHARACTER STUDY
ABOUT A WOMAN MY AGE,

17:46.064 --> 17:47.775
AND IT REALLY MOVED ME.

17:47.858 --> 17:51.653
SO PLEASE PULL THE COVER PAGE
FOR SCRIPT NUMBER THREE

17:51.737 --> 17:52.905
AND TELL ME WHO WROTE IT.

17:54.990 --> 17:55.991
- IT'S BY J.J.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.785
- ABRAMS?

17:57.868 --> 18:00.621
- NO, JUST J.J.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.831
IT'S TITLED <i> THE PAINTED WALL,</i>

18:02.915 --> 18:06.835
AKA <i> CLEVELAND STATE JUNIOR YEAR</i>
<i>FILM STUDIES PROJECT.</i>

18:08.212 --> 18:09.713
- SO THE FOLLOW-UP

18:09.797 --> 18:14.343
TO MY OSCAR-NOMINATED
PERFORMANCE IS A STUDENT FILM?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.303
- YOU STILL GOING TO DO IT?

18:16.386 --> 18:18.514
- WELL, OF COURSE I AM.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.350
THAT SCRIPT SPOKE TO ME.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.354
I WOULDN'T BACK OUT NOW EVEN
IF ONE OF YOU TRIED TO MAKE ME.

18:25.437 --> 18:28.774
SO GO AHEAD.
TRY.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.692
YOU CAN TRY A LITTLE HARDER
THAN THAT,

18:30.776 --> 18:34.321
BECAUSE I AM NOT GOING
TO GIVE UP.

18:34.404 --> 18:37.074
OKAY, FINE.

18:37.157 --> 18:40.160
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,
I AM GOING TO DO SOMETHING

18:40.244 --> 18:42.246
BECAUSE IT MOVED ME.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.833
WHAT'S THAT, MELANIE?
I SHOULDN'T DO IT?

18:45.916 --> 18:50.546
- HONEY, I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
- NOW YOU DON'T TALK.

18:50.629 --> 18:51.922
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.883
THERE'S NO TELLING
WHERE GOOD ART COMES FROM.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.553
I MEAN, EVEN ELKA'S PLAY
INSPIRED US

18:57.636 --> 18:59.555
TO TAKE A HARD LOOK
AT OURSELVES.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.390
- THAT'S THE TRUTH.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.600
- YOU REALIZE WE WALKED OUT
BEFORE THE PLAY WAS OVER.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.066
- BEFORE YOU THREE
MOVED TO CLEVELAND,

19:11.149 --> 19:14.403
I WAS A NORMAL WIDOW,
LIVING A QUIET LIFE,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.905
NOT MAKING ANY TROUBLE
FOR ANYONE.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.699
AND SINCE YOU GOT HERE,

19:18.782 --> 19:21.368
I'VE HAD TO PRETEND
TO BE YOUR OLD IRISH NANNY,

19:21.451 --> 19:23.787
YOUR GAY GIRLFRIEND
ON A CRUISE.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.040
I'VE HAD TO SPEND JAIL TIME
AND SHARE A CELL WITH YOU

19:27.124 --> 19:29.918
AND YOUR BIG MAN HANDS.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.170
[audience laughing]

19:32.254 --> 19:35.883
OH, YOU JUST TURNED
MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN.

19:35.966 --> 19:37.551
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, ELKA?

19:37.634 --> 19:40.762
- I'M SAYING...

19:40.846 --> 19:42.306
THANK YOU.

19:46.685 --> 19:50.731
- "I REALIZED THESE WOMEN
HADN'T RUINED MY LIFE.

19:50.814 --> 19:54.902
"THEY'D BROADENED IT
AND GIVEN IT LAUGHTER.

19:54.985 --> 19:59.406
"SOMETIMES IT'S MORE FUN
TO JOIN THE DEVIL

19:59.489 --> 20:01.575
THAN TO BEAT HIM."

20:04.745 --> 20:07.331
[cheers and applause]

20:10.876 --> 20:13.086
- SO THE SECRET WASN'T
THAT YOU'RE DOING A PLAY.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.630
IT'S THAT YOU LIKE US.

20:14.713 --> 20:19.134
- I KEEP TELLING YOU,
IT'S A WORK OF FICTION.

20:19.217 --> 20:21.470
- WE MADE YOUR LIFE BETTER.

20:21.553 --> 20:24.473
- AND YOU LOVE US FOR IT,
YOU BIG SOFTY.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.933
- I'M SO GLAD YOU LIKE US.

20:26.016 --> 20:30.270
- OH.
- YOU THINK WE'RE GREAT.

20:30.354 --> 20:33.815
- AND PEOPLE WONDER
WHY WRITERS DRINK.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.029
