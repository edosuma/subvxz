01:16.058 --> 01:18.596
You... can't...

01:19.478 --> 01:21.020
have...

01:22.356 --> 01:23.471
my daughter.

01:25.776 --> 01:27.520
No!

01:30.656 --> 01:33.906
No! Stay away!

01:34.035 --> 01:36.027
Stay out of here.

01:42.877 --> 01:44.916
Stay out!

01:50.092 --> 01:51.800
She's my daughter!

02:00.144 --> 02:02.053
Stay away!

02:02.563 --> 02:03.678
Stay away!

02:04.106 --> 02:05.387
Stay away!

02:18.788 --> 02:20.365
Stay out!

03:00.371 --> 03:02.328
Mommy.

03:02.456 --> 03:05.706
Mommy, come and play with me

03:05.835 --> 03:08.207
in my room.

03:08.337 --> 03:11.422
Right now, Mommy. Okay?

03:12.758 --> 03:13.754
Hey!

03:13.884 --> 03:15.462
I got an idea!

03:25.285 --> 03:27.527
No! Let go of me!

03:27.663 --> 03:30.866
No! Who will protect her? No!

03:30.999 --> 03:32.707
Let me go!

03:32.835 --> 03:34.377
Rachel! Rachel!

03:34.503 --> 03:36.579
No! I can't leave her!

03:36.713 --> 03:39.121
I have to protect her! Rachel!

03:39.258 --> 03:41.962
Okay, Rachel,

03:42.094 --> 03:46.139
your mama's gotta go somewhere
to rest, so she'll feel better.

03:47.182 --> 03:48.593
Are you okay?

03:50.018 --> 03:52.094
Is your dad around?

03:52.229 --> 03:53.889
I don't have a dad.

03:55.441 --> 03:58.560
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

03:58.694 --> 04:02.110
We're gonna take you someplace nice,
with a nice family,

04:02.239 --> 04:04.279
until we get this sorted out, okay?

04:05.200 --> 04:06.196
No!

04:06.326 --> 04:07.785
Rachel!

04:26.221 --> 04:27.384
Rachel!

04:29.850 --> 04:31.309
Rachel!

04:33.812 --> 04:35.306
Rachel!

04:40.527 --> 04:41.808
Stop it!

04:41.945 --> 04:43.605
Stop!

04:43.739 --> 04:44.853
Stop it!

04:45.282 --> 04:47.275
Stop it!

05:27.496 --> 05:31.197
Monday morning!
Time to get up and go to work!

05:31.333 --> 05:33.409
But never fear, 
the Moneyman is here

05:33.544 --> 05:37.957
to help you through
your Monday morning ordeal with $101...

05:42.553 --> 05:44.592
Sorry, Walt.

05:58.444 --> 06:02.228
- Are you workin' tonight?
- They moved me to the graveyard shift.

06:02.364 --> 06:04.238
Was the dog in the house last night?

06:04.783 --> 06:06.527
He's allowed in the morning.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.697
Daytime's okay, but not at night.

06:09.830 --> 06:12.072
I only let him in this morning.

06:13.542 --> 06:14.787
There's no juice.

06:14.919 --> 06:16.662
We're out of a lot of things.

06:16.795 --> 06:19.796
Rachel, I heard dog noises
when I was trying to sleep.

06:19.924 --> 06:22.000
Walter was not in the house.

06:22.134 --> 06:23.759
That voice!

06:23.886 --> 06:26.092
As long as you're under this roof

06:26.222 --> 06:29.637
you respect us as your parents
and treat us like that.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.142
Sorry.

06:32.228 --> 06:35.015
Take it easy, Boyd.
She might not be with us

06:35.147 --> 06:38.397
much longer.
Your mom's making progress, right?

06:38.525 --> 06:40.898
On her new medication, the Clozaril?

06:41.028 --> 06:43.899
Where are we gonna make up
that 300 bucks a month?

06:46.450 --> 06:48.110
May I be excused?

06:53.540 --> 06:56.826
- Well, hello!
- Oh! She speaks!

06:57.878 --> 07:00.452
Her mouth opens and sounds come out.

07:00.589 --> 07:04.207
She didn't call all weekend.
I figured her voice was gone.

07:04.343 --> 07:07.095
What's wrong?
Foster dad being a pain again?

07:07.221 --> 07:09.260
Yeah.

07:09.723 --> 07:12.724
Why are you so weirdly happy?

07:12.851 --> 07:14.891
Do I look any different?

07:15.145 --> 07:16.972
Do you look any...

07:18.440 --> 07:21.726
Oh, my God! You did it?

07:21.860 --> 07:23.485
Yeah.

07:23.612 --> 07:25.569
Who?

07:25.698 --> 07:29.992
You wouldn't believe me if I told you,
so... I'm bringing him to lunch.

07:30.119 --> 07:31.233
You suck!

07:31.370 --> 07:32.948
Oh, love you, too!

07:35.583 --> 07:36.993
Best blood.

07:40.242 --> 07:41.820
Are... you

07:41.952 --> 07:42.652
ready

07:42.787 --> 07:44.281
to... beat-beat?

07:46.665 --> 07:48.788
B-H-S

07:48.918 --> 07:50.709
will dominate

07:50.836 --> 07:52.710
the rest!

08:18.239 --> 08:21.109
Morning, girls.
How you doin' this morning?

08:21.242 --> 08:23.318
What's goin' on?
Get away from me!

08:23.452 --> 08:25.575
According to these new rules,

08:25.705 --> 08:28.278
how many points do I get
if I do that chick?

08:28.416 --> 08:30.657
The fat one? Six.

08:30.793 --> 08:33.710
I did her last week and you gave me five.
And she's not fat.

08:33.837 --> 08:39.212
I figure if he's got the balls to go in
after you, I'm giving him an extra point.

08:40.970 --> 08:44.968
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, Jesse, Jess, that Tracy girl!

08:45.099 --> 08:47.720
You gotta get all over that girl, man.

08:47.852 --> 08:48.847
Serious.

08:48.978 --> 08:51.136
- She's on my list.
- Definitely fine.

08:51.272 --> 08:53.348
She got an ass stamped BP, baby!

08:53.482 --> 08:55.522
Bulldog property!

08:58.904 --> 09:01.027
Can you develop these at work?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.286
Woof! Woof!

09:09.415 --> 09:12.167
- Total coyote date.
- That's harsh, bro.

09:12.293 --> 09:13.668
It's the truth.

09:13.794 --> 09:16.368
- What's a coyote date?
- You don't know?

09:16.505 --> 09:20.254
That's when you wake up,
some ugly chick sleeping on your arm,

09:20.384 --> 09:22.922
and you'd rather gnaw it off
than wake her up.

09:25.556 --> 09:27.881
God, woman, you come prepared!

09:29.268 --> 09:31.344
Tell me who the special someone is.

09:31.479 --> 09:34.230
All will be revealed in due time.

09:52.792 --> 09:55.876
"Romeo and Juliet", 
a tale of star-crossed lovers,

09:57.268 --> 09:57.810
pulled apart by their families,
society, and, some might say, by fate.

09:57.810 --> 10:04.145
Pulled apart by their families,
society, and, some might say, by fate.

10:04.275 --> 10:09.352
Why is it that we are so moved
by love that ends with separation?

10:09.489 --> 10:11.695
What say?

10:11.824 --> 10:13.864
Anyone.

10:14.619 --> 10:16.777
Anyone!

10:17.371 --> 10:18.782
Rachel.

10:22.585 --> 10:24.874
I don't know that I believe in it.

10:25.004 --> 10:26.913
Believe in what?

10:27.632 --> 10:29.126
Love.

10:29.258 --> 10:34.679
Well... then you've got bigger problems
than passing this class.

10:34.805 --> 10:37.842
- Who would love her?
- Yes, Arnold?

10:37.975 --> 10:41.427
"Love is 15 seconds
of squishing noises. "

10:41.562 --> 10:43.851
Johnny Rotten.
Know what I'm saying?

10:43.981 --> 10:46.651
Dork! Kill that kid.

10:46.776 --> 10:51.687
Are all love stories tragedies? I mean,
unless they die at the same time

10:51.823 --> 10:57.446
all lovers are eventually
separated by death, right?

10:57.578 --> 11:01.706
Then Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy.
They could only be together in death.

11:01.874 --> 11:03.368
Yes!

11:03.501 --> 11:05.244
Very good!

11:05.378 --> 11:11.831
A foul cynic. Most cliché.
A true romantic. How refreshing!

11:12.969 --> 11:13.964
Yeah.

11:15.847 --> 11:17.175
Shut up.

11:37.907 --> 11:40.066
Ohh, hello there!

11:42.578 --> 11:45.200
Hey, girls, what's happenin'?

11:45.331 --> 11:47.739
Move out. Thank you.

11:47.875 --> 11:52.004
Oh, Mark Bing wanted me to invite you
to his party Friday night.

11:53.298 --> 11:56.334
- Is Jesse going with anyone?
- I don't think so.

11:56.467 --> 11:59.421
Could you please refrain
from shooting my ass?

12:42.347 --> 12:44.635
Lisa?

13:13.544 --> 13:16.415
Did you see that!

13:26.099 --> 13:28.803
Let's stay back, please!

13:49.831 --> 13:53.615
You better come with me.
A girl just killed herself in the lot.

13:54.502 --> 13:55.877
Stay here.

14:21.487 --> 14:23.646
Best blood.

14:24.741 --> 14:27.148
Oh, my God.

14:27.285 --> 14:30.701
Rachel... come on, back away.

14:33.833 --> 14:37.284
Attention all students. 
Report to your homeroom classes.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.662
Report to your homeroom classes.

14:41.841 --> 14:43.917
Oh, man!
Whose car is this?

14:47.769 --> 14:49.761
She was

14:49.896 --> 14:54.225
really happy this morning.
I don't understand why she...

14:55.985 --> 14:57.645
It's okay.

14:57.779 --> 14:59.937
Let it out.

15:00.115 --> 15:01.229
No.

15:03.243 --> 15:05.282
I don't cry.

15:09.749 --> 15:15.455
Miss Snell, please report
to the principal's office.

15:16.798 --> 15:19.336
I have to go.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.709
Rachel, stay here, okay?

15:21.845 --> 15:24.252
I'll be back as soon as I can.

15:39.487 --> 15:42.572
One of our students died today.

15:43.825 --> 15:47.988
We will observe at exactly 1pm
a moment of silence.

15:53.501 --> 15:56.586
- Lisa Parker may be gone
- Hand me the scorebook.

15:56.713 --> 15:59.251
But she will not be forgotten
by her friends.

15:59.382 --> 16:02.087
She will not be forgotten
by her fellow students.

16:02.218 --> 16:04.425
She will not be forgotten
by her teachers

16:05.263 --> 16:07.505
or by her school.

16:25.742 --> 16:28.031
Her parents are gonna want all this.

16:35.293 --> 16:36.206
Oh, my.

16:37.584 --> 16:38.126
That girl Lisa, right?

16:38.126 --> 16:39.289
That girl Lisa, right?

16:39.419 --> 16:40.700
Yeah.

16:40.837 --> 16:44.289
I was supposed to have lunch
with her today.

16:44.424 --> 16:45.799
Yeah?

16:49.012 --> 16:52.132
You guys thought she was shit, right?

16:53.183 --> 16:56.100
Don't look at me like this.
You thought she was shit.

16:56.228 --> 16:57.556
What did you do?

16:57.687 --> 16:59.727
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

17:01.775 --> 17:06.401
It's just Lisa was acting all happy,
you know, like we were going steady.

17:06.530 --> 17:09.695
I had to break the news to her
that she was just a pump.

17:09.824 --> 17:11.568
You know, a nut.

17:11.701 --> 17:14.027
She didn't mean anything to me.

17:16.873 --> 17:19.031
I guess she couldn't handle it.

17:20.961 --> 17:23.118
Is that your brilliant attempt to fix it?

17:24.714 --> 17:26.672
That's good.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.798
You need all the points you can get.
I don't know why you're erasing them.

17:30.929 --> 17:32.968
That's cold, man.

17:35.350 --> 17:39.134
On Friday the King's University scout
is coming to the game.

17:40.063 --> 17:42.636
If all this gets out... Sex and suicide?

17:42.774 --> 17:46.772
Come on, man.
Catholic schools frown on that shit.

17:47.946 --> 17:51.694
If I don't get into a good school,
my dad's gonna kill me.

17:52.701 --> 17:54.777
But nobody's gonna find out.

17:58.039 --> 18:00.281
Lisa took a picture of us last night.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.375
What if her parents ask questions?

18:04.504 --> 18:06.544
That's a problem.

18:06.673 --> 18:08.749
Oh... shit!

18:10.010 --> 18:12.501
I'll handle it. I'll take care of it.

18:14.764 --> 18:16.093
How?

18:16.933 --> 18:18.973
Relax, man. Come on.

18:19.102 --> 18:21.142
Come on.

19:15.330 --> 19:18.367
- Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.
- It's all right.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.125
You're Rachel, right?

19:21.253 --> 19:22.795
Yeah. Yeah.

19:22.921 --> 19:25.044
I'm Jesse. English?

19:25.173 --> 19:28.625
Right. The true romantic?

19:29.720 --> 19:32.258
- Yeah.
- Rachel, listen. That Lisa girl?

19:32.389 --> 19:36.434
She had pictures that have
what you might call sentimental value.

19:36.560 --> 19:39.098
I figured 20 bucks ought to cover it.

19:39.771 --> 19:41.052
No.

19:42.941 --> 19:44.981
What do you want, 30?

19:45.110 --> 19:47.399
They're not your pictures, all right?

19:47.529 --> 19:50.400
It's not like she's gonna
pick 'em up, is it?

19:52.117 --> 19:54.275
Cut it out, man.

19:55.412 --> 19:58.081
Rachel, I'll tell you what.

19:58.206 --> 20:02.453
I'll swing by when you get off work,
take you out for a little cruise.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.079
Come on. I don't bite.

20:06.214 --> 20:08.254
Unless you want me to.

20:09.092 --> 20:10.919
I don't think so.

20:11.053 --> 20:12.547
Why not?

20:16.725 --> 20:18.267
Because I'm a dyke.

20:23.023 --> 20:24.303
That's funny.

20:25.484 --> 20:27.856
- Don't laugh, man.
- Just drive.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.808
Hey!

21:05.399 --> 21:07.438
How you doin' tonight?

21:09.236 --> 21:12.984
"For a moment I thought
someone was actually seeing me

21:13.115 --> 21:15.238
but it was all a lie. "

21:15.367 --> 21:18.818
"Eric lied when he said I was special,
and I was lying to myself. "

21:18.954 --> 21:20.993
"I believed him. "

21:21.123 --> 21:26.081
Rachel, is there anything in there
that strikes a chord for you?

21:27.337 --> 21:29.745
Do you know what Lisa was referring to?

21:33.802 --> 21:36.471
Yesterday she, uh...

21:38.932 --> 21:41.684
She told me she lost her virginity.

21:41.810 --> 21:44.052
Do you know this boy?

21:44.855 --> 21:46.230
Eric Stark.

21:46.356 --> 21:48.396
He's on the team.

21:48.525 --> 21:50.103
Can I talk to you?

21:50.235 --> 21:52.691
Excuse us, Rachel.

21:55.532 --> 21:58.735
Robbie, I had a freshman girl
crying last week.

21:58.869 --> 22:01.823
Five more have been in my office
this semester.

22:01.955 --> 22:05.656
I couldn't get anything out of them,
but... their friends told me

22:05.792 --> 22:09.126
football players slept with them,
then dumped them.

22:09.254 --> 22:12.125
It's not illegal to break a girl's heart.

22:12.257 --> 22:14.297
Eric is 18.

22:14.426 --> 22:16.882
Lisa was 16. That's statutory rape.

22:17.012 --> 22:18.210
That's a stretch.

22:18.347 --> 22:21.846
Let's make it, before someone else's
daughter jumps off a building.

22:21.975 --> 22:22.971
Sue.

22:24.770 --> 22:26.228
Listen.

22:26.355 --> 22:30.139
Are you sure you're not still trying
to save a girl that died 20 years ago?

22:32.235 --> 22:34.726
Help me!

22:34.863 --> 22:37.354
Plug it up! Plug it up!

22:45.707 --> 22:49.408
Okay. I'll look into it.

23:03.272 --> 23:05.063
That was great.

23:07.734 --> 23:08.766
Yeah.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.482
The minute man!

23:15.617 --> 23:18.784
Do it, baby! Do it again!

23:18.912 --> 23:21.913
Gimme the book. Gimme the book!

23:25.043 --> 23:26.870
Oh, my!

23:27.004 --> 23:31.001
- He nailed a hottie!
- No, no, an eight.

23:34.052 --> 23:36.378
Is he going back in for double time?

23:41.894 --> 23:44.219
I don't feel good. I'm gonna be sick.

23:44.354 --> 23:46.643
- He's gonna puke!
- Not in my car!

23:53.572 --> 23:57.320
You know, Mark invited me
to his party on Friday.

24:02.623 --> 24:04.580
What are you thinking about?

24:05.793 --> 24:07.073
Nobody.

24:08.295 --> 24:10.537
I asked what, not who.

24:10.672 --> 24:13.163
It's nothing. It's, uh...

24:16.470 --> 24:19.008
Doesn't it bother you that some girl

24:19.139 --> 24:21.179
offed herself yesterday?

24:22.142 --> 24:24.182
Why? She wasn't anybody.

24:24.311 --> 24:25.390
What?

24:25.521 --> 24:28.854
I mean, I didn't know her.

24:33.445 --> 24:38.273
You know, I still don't have
a date for Mark's party.

24:39.910 --> 24:41.701
Hint, hint.

24:52.094 --> 24:53.553
Shit!

25:09.570 --> 25:11.609
Stop.

25:12.656 --> 25:14.696
Stop!

25:16.327 --> 25:18.284
Rachel, stop this.

25:45.522 --> 25:47.598
Hey! Hey! Get back here!

25:49.068 --> 25:50.811
That rotten dog.

26:24.687 --> 26:27.641
Hey! Your dumb dog got out.

27:04.435 --> 27:06.262
Walter!

27:18.574 --> 27:19.439
Stay!

27:21.410 --> 27:22.573
Stop!

27:29.460 --> 27:31.583
Walter! My God!

27:35.382 --> 27:36.841
Walter!

27:46.101 --> 27:48.141
Stop! Help!

27:50.606 --> 27:53.061
Please stop! Stop!

27:55.486 --> 27:56.684
Stop!

28:00.240 --> 28:01.439
Rachel?

28:01.575 --> 28:03.449
- Please!
- What happened?

28:03.577 --> 28:05.617
Please help me!

28:24.139 --> 28:26.215
Are you gonna be all right?

28:30.104 --> 28:31.764
Sorry.

28:31.897 --> 28:34.139
For what?

28:35.693 --> 28:38.896
For making you come out here
all this way.

28:39.029 --> 28:40.571
Don't worry about it.

28:40.698 --> 28:43.153
What about my windshield?
How bizarre was that?

28:43.284 --> 28:45.691
I'm sorry about your car.

28:45.828 --> 28:49.493
It wasn't your fault.
It was probably a rock or something.

28:53.252 --> 28:55.126
Walter's banged up pretty bad.

28:55.254 --> 28:56.878
He has broken ribs.

28:57.006 --> 29:00.339
He tore an artery in his front leg.
He's lost quite a bit of blood.

29:00.467 --> 29:02.211
His pressure's stabilised.

29:02.344 --> 29:04.420
He's gonna make it.

29:05.723 --> 29:08.261
- Can I see him?
- Come back tomorrow.

29:08.392 --> 29:10.052
Any time after eight.

29:17.776 --> 29:20.861
Don't worry. It's because
you look like a mass murderer.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.659
What's with the music?

29:29.788 --> 29:32.540
Don't they have anything good,
like Garbage?

29:32.666 --> 29:35.952
- You like Garbage?
- Yeah. Shirley Manson, she rocks.

29:41.050 --> 29:43.089
Lisa loved her.

29:47.139 --> 29:49.179
You two were really close, huh?

29:54.146 --> 29:56.186
I'm really sorry.

29:57.566 --> 29:59.606
Sometimes...

30:00.903 --> 30:04.023
I'd see someone from behind

30:04.156 --> 30:08.070
and... I'd know, I'd just

30:08.827 --> 30:10.867
know it was Lisa.

30:11.538 --> 30:14.290
And she'd turn around, and it wasn't.

30:14.416 --> 30:16.990
But sometimes it was.

30:17.127 --> 30:19.167
And now

30:20.422 --> 30:24.372
whenever I see someone who looks
like her and she turns around,

30:26.303 --> 30:28.343
it won't be.

30:30.057 --> 30:32.133
Ever.

30:46.073 --> 30:47.900
It's gettin' pretty late.

30:48.033 --> 30:51.070
- Can I give you a ride home?
- I can walk.

30:52.788 --> 30:54.282
Yeah, right.

30:55.374 --> 30:57.165
I can hitch. Don't worry.

30:57.293 --> 30:59.285
Then you can go hitch.

31:00.337 --> 31:02.377
Or I could just

31:03.465 --> 31:05.541
wait for my limo.

31:06.427 --> 31:10.127
Yeah, you could do that.
Just wait for your limo.

31:16.687 --> 31:18.726
Come on.

31:29.955 --> 31:33.823
I guess I'll see you in school tomorrow.

31:33.959 --> 31:35.667
Sure.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.584
You'll let me know how Walter's doing?

31:39.715 --> 31:41.126
Yeah.

31:41.258 --> 31:43.631
And uh

31:43.761 --> 31:45.800
thank you

31:45.971 --> 31:48.011
for everything.

31:49.433 --> 31:51.592
Well, uh... good night.

31:54.897 --> 31:56.060
Good night.

31:56.816 --> 31:59.770
- Dry weather.
- Acrylic sweater.

32:05.908 --> 32:08.066
I shook her hand.

32:08.744 --> 32:11.947
Thank you for your support.
I'd like your vote.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.280
Stupid.

32:16.877 --> 32:18.206
Lisa!

32:21.215 --> 32:24.666
Don't! Don't jump!

32:59.559 --> 33:01.884
Last night I took a look at your file.

33:02.019 --> 33:05.104
Your mom is at Arkham
for schizophrenia?

33:06.941 --> 33:09.147
How's she doing?

33:09.277 --> 33:11.150
She's gonna be fine.

33:12.738 --> 33:17.151
I had a really traumatic experience
in high school.

33:17.285 --> 33:21.578
I tried to help someone,
and it backfired horribly.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.701
No! Stop!

33:29.171 --> 33:31.164
I spent some time at Arkham

33:31.799 --> 33:34.124
as a patient.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.134
Does that shock you?

33:36.262 --> 33:40.723
I guess. I mean, you seem
pretty normal to me.

33:42.476 --> 33:45.762
Yeah, well... I try.

33:46.898 --> 33:47.893
So,

33:49.192 --> 33:51.231
do you visit your mom often?

33:54.405 --> 33:56.481
Is that scary for you?

33:58.367 --> 33:59.862
What do you mean?

33:59.994 --> 34:04.288
It's perfectly normal to be afraid
of turning out like your parents.

34:04.415 --> 34:06.324
Come on!

34:06.459 --> 34:09.543
I know I'm ten times more likely
to get it than most people.

34:10.379 --> 34:12.538
I didn't mean to patronise you.

34:13.674 --> 34:15.501
So,

34:15.635 --> 34:17.757
is that scary for you?

34:24.101 --> 34:25.512
Rachel,

34:27.230 --> 34:31.014
in a way you've lost your mother

34:31.150 --> 34:33.273
and now you've lost a friend.

34:34.529 --> 34:37.065
Losing people close to you can be

34:37.197 --> 34:41.326
very painful and lonely.

34:54.966 --> 34:56.958
- If you wanna talk...
- No!

35:06.227 --> 35:08.979
I'm sorry. I...

35:09.105 --> 35:11.062
I must've knocked it.

35:11.190 --> 35:13.598
I didn't see you knock it.

35:21.033 --> 35:22.576
I know.

35:23.953 --> 35:26.111
I know what you did to her.

35:38.506 --> 35:39.048
As we can see from last year's film

35:39.048 --> 35:40.792
As we can see from last year's film

35:40.925 --> 35:44.259
the Carlin Devils play tough,
smash-mouth football.

35:45.179 --> 35:47.006
Here we see Mr Bing...

35:47.140 --> 35:50.509
- I thought you got the pictures.
- Relax, all right?

35:50.643 --> 35:53.217
Nobody knows.
I'm sure they're at the Photo Mat.

35:53.354 --> 35:56.474
It takes an hour to develop film.
Come on, man.

35:56.607 --> 35:59.277
Mr Bing, on your feet.

36:02.739 --> 36:05.146
- Turn around and drop trou.
- What?

36:05.283 --> 36:09.197
You heard. Drop trou, shorts and all.

36:09.329 --> 36:10.953
Now, son!

36:11.080 --> 36:13.239
If you wanna stay a starter on this team.

36:16.419 --> 36:18.827
You undress like a girl. Let's go.

36:22.175 --> 36:24.547
After that half-assed block,

36:24.677 --> 36:28.509
I wanted to check if maybe you
had a tampon string between your legs.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.676
Sit.

36:36.189 --> 36:40.566
All right, girls, this Friday it's gonna be
kill or be killed. Let's go!

36:45.406 --> 36:47.732
- Yeah, Bing!
- You ready for the game Friday?

36:47.909 --> 36:49.569
Yeah!

36:56.125 --> 36:59.245
You've never seen,
met or talked to Lisa Parker?

36:59.379 --> 37:01.039
No, sir, never.

37:02.173 --> 37:04.213
Who's this you're hanging on to?

37:08.012 --> 37:11.713
Salvation Army alert.
Look who Jess is talking to.

37:11.849 --> 37:14.056
She's such a bottom-feeder.

37:14.185 --> 37:16.142
You working tonight?

37:16.270 --> 37:18.347
No.

37:18.481 --> 37:21.565
You wanna meet me at the diner?

37:22.443 --> 37:24.483
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:25.655 --> 37:26.734
Okay.

37:26.864 --> 37:28.940
Cool. See you there.

37:33.705 --> 37:36.278
So, what did he want?

37:36.416 --> 37:38.574
He asked me out.

37:40.420 --> 37:44.832
- What did you say?
- I said, "Okay. It's your funeral. "

37:44.966 --> 37:47.718
Well, okay, pardon me,

37:47.844 --> 37:51.295
but is hanging out with jock-boy
such a hot idea?

37:51.431 --> 37:55.380
I just heard that he's dating
Tracy Campbell, you know.

37:55.518 --> 37:58.305
And she uh...

37:58.438 --> 38:02.649
Right now she's giving you
the look of a thousand deaths.

38:08.740 --> 38:10.946
She's beautiful.

38:13.119 --> 38:15.325
Yeah, duh!

38:16.886 --> 38:17.428
Coach says I'm starting this week.

38:17.428 --> 38:19.754
Coach says I'm starting this week.

38:23.309 --> 38:25.267
What happened in there?

38:25.395 --> 38:30.223
Kelton, man. Somebody told him
I did Lisa and now I'm suspended.

38:30.358 --> 38:31.852
My dad will kill me.

38:31.985 --> 38:34.310
- What about the game?
- Who cares?

38:34.446 --> 38:37.779
Kelton had a picture of Lisa and I,
and talked statutory rape.

38:37.907 --> 38:40.315
Now I face the DA on Thursday.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.025
Relax. It's bullshit, all right?

38:43.163 --> 38:47.326
Your dad will kick your ass, but
he's a lawyer. He'll kill that shit dead.

38:47.459 --> 38:51.752
I'll miss the game of the year.
Football scouts are gonna be there

38:51.880 --> 38:54.715
and I'll be on the bench
with a thumb up my ass.

38:54.841 --> 39:00.677
And that bitch Rachel will be talking
all kinds of shit to anyone who'll listen.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.597
The best defence is a good offence.

39:03.933 --> 39:07.717
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We're gonna do some damage control.

39:13.902 --> 39:16.606
Get it together. He's just a guy.

39:21.075 --> 39:23.115
You are gonna be late.

39:25.413 --> 39:26.872
Boyd?

39:31.961 --> 39:34.001
Emilyn?

39:37.550 --> 39:39.626
Forget your keys?

40:47.328 --> 40:49.368
Let's take the front.

40:58.631 --> 41:01.716
Rachel...

41:04.053 --> 41:05.927
Stop it! Stop!

41:06.055 --> 41:08.095
Stop! Stop!

41:08.391 --> 41:11.558
- Rachel...
- Stop it!

41:27.368 --> 41:28.567
Hello?

41:28.703 --> 41:32.072
What's your favourite scary movie?

41:33.208 --> 41:35.117
Rachel?

41:35.251 --> 41:36.829
What?

41:36.961 --> 41:39.001
Are you naked?

41:39.130 --> 41:41.253
Who is this?

41:41.382 --> 41:44.882
Or are you wearing a little red towel?

41:52.143 --> 41:54.136
It's playtime!

41:56.147 --> 41:58.140
Who the fuck is this?

41:59.317 --> 42:01.773
Why don't I come and show you,
you fuckin' dyke?

42:04.239 --> 42:06.278
What do you want!

42:12.664 --> 42:13.826
Who is this!

42:13.957 --> 42:16.530
Don't you recognise the voice?

42:16.668 --> 42:19.206
Who does it sound like?

42:19.337 --> 42:21.377
Hey, Rachel!

42:24.509 --> 42:26.087
I'm calling the police.

42:26.219 --> 42:29.884
- Rachel! Rachel!
- Come on out here, Rachel!

42:30.014 --> 42:31.722
You bitch!

42:32.767 --> 42:35.970
- What are you doing?
- Fuckin' her over like she's fuckin' me.

42:36.104 --> 42:39.021
No way.
What the fuck are you doin'?

42:41.151 --> 42:44.899
I have an emergency!
I'm at 3366 Broad Street!

42:57.876 --> 43:01.209
- It's the parents!
- Let's go! Let's get outta here!

43:07.677 --> 43:10.429
Yeah. I'm still here.

43:13.349 --> 43:16.553
- If she touches you one more time...
- You never liked her.

43:16.686 --> 43:18.228
Everything's okay now.

43:18.354 --> 43:20.596
What's this?

43:20.732 --> 43:22.440
Really.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.847
Thanks.

43:24.694 --> 43:26.687
Look at the window.

43:26.821 --> 43:29.063
What the hell happened here?

43:30.241 --> 43:32.068
How should I know?

43:32.202 --> 43:34.740
Ah, Jesus!

43:47.425 --> 43:50.545
Don't go tellin' no stories
about my boy Eric.

44:10.478 --> 44:12.270
Motherfucker!

44:15.942 --> 44:16.938
Come on!

44:17.736 --> 44:20.440
Why do the innocent
always get hit in a drive-by!

44:21.698 --> 44:24.948
What happened to you last night?
I waited up for you.

44:28.705 --> 44:32.204
- Why don't you tell me?
- What are you talking about?

44:33.960 --> 44:36.534
I waited at the café for over an hour.

44:37.380 --> 44:39.254
I'll tell you what happened.

44:39.382 --> 44:41.671
What is wrong with this picture?

44:41.801 --> 44:43.960
What does he see in her?

44:44.095 --> 44:47.547
Come on, Trace.
You're caviar, she's Cheez Whiz.

44:47.682 --> 44:52.143
He'll come around. He's letting little Jesse
do the thinking for big Jesse.

44:53.855 --> 44:57.604
I just don't want any part of this, okay?

44:58.401 --> 45:01.153
Let me talk to Mark. I'll work this out.

45:01.279 --> 45:03.735
They were probably drunk
and being stupid.

45:03.865 --> 45:05.905
No, don't.

45:07.494 --> 45:10.495
Maybe all of this isn't such a good idea.

45:10.622 --> 45:12.661
All of what?

45:15.252 --> 45:19.083
Guys like you are supposed
to date girls like Tracy, okay?

45:19.839 --> 45:23.754
That's what this is about?
No. Hold on.

45:25.095 --> 45:27.253
Let me take you out for a date.

45:27.389 --> 45:29.677
A nice mellow one. Tonight.

45:30.809 --> 45:33.726
I'm not going anywhere
until you say yes. Try me.

45:34.604 --> 45:36.644
See?

45:38.149 --> 45:40.522
I mean it. I'm telling you.

45:40.652 --> 45:42.691
Just say yes.

45:43.572 --> 45:44.651
Okay.

45:44.781 --> 45:47.533
- What was that?
- Okay.

45:47.659 --> 45:49.698
All right!

45:52.163 --> 45:53.362
Yes.

46:00.463 --> 46:03.215
Rachel, I need to talk to you.

46:07.250 --> 46:09.124
We need to talk.

46:09.252 --> 46:12.668
- What's the matter?
- Did you go by Rachel's?

46:12.798 --> 46:16.878
Yeah. We were just sending her
a little message.

46:17.010 --> 46:20.213
Give it to me next time.
I'll make sure she gets it.

46:20.347 --> 46:23.597
What are you gettin' all bent for?
This girl's a skank.

46:23.725 --> 46:26.892
- You don't even know her!
- What, and you do?

46:27.020 --> 46:32.774
She doesn't deserve to be treated like
that. Who are you to send her a message?

46:32.901 --> 46:37.230
Who am I? I'm a friend who gives a shit
that my boy's goin' down for rape!

46:37.364 --> 46:40.033
I'm gonna do anything
to keep her from talkin'.

46:40.158 --> 46:44.405
Eric's a big boy. You got anything
to tell her, deal with me.

46:44.538 --> 46:47.242
- Deal with you?
- Deal with me.

46:47.374 --> 46:49.413
No. You're gonna have to deal with me.

46:54.047 --> 46:56.538
What is wrong with you, Jesse!

46:56.675 --> 46:59.545
This is us, man! We're all friends here!

47:00.887 --> 47:03.213
No. We just grew up together.

47:05.047 --> 47:05.589
This is just a test that will
let me know how to help you better.

47:05.589 --> 47:09.456
This is just a test that will
let me know how to help you better.

47:09.593 --> 47:11.087
You're wasting your time.

47:11.220 --> 47:13.971
Just answer the statements
true or false.

47:16.850 --> 47:20.385
"There's a man inside the television
who tells me what to do. "

47:20.521 --> 47:24.305
Uh, false? I don't see the point.

47:24.441 --> 47:29.150
"Sometimes my thoughts assume
the form of a giant insect. "

47:29.279 --> 47:31.319
This doesn't make any sense.

47:31.448 --> 47:32.942
Answer true or false.

47:33.075 --> 47:36.907
"Sometimes my thoughts assume
the form of a giant insect. "

47:37.037 --> 47:38.068
False.

47:38.205 --> 47:41.289
"If you want to play the piano well,
you have to practise. "

47:41.416 --> 47:42.615
True.

47:42.751 --> 47:45.705
"Large furry animals crawl
on my face while I sleep. "

47:45.838 --> 47:46.833
True.

47:49.258 --> 47:50.835
I have a dog.

47:54.888 --> 47:57.806
"Sometimes I can move things
with my mind. "

48:01.019 --> 48:03.641
- You can't make me do this.
- Sit down.

48:03.772 --> 48:05.183
I'm trying to help.

48:05.315 --> 48:08.020
- You're not my mother.
- I'm trying to be your friend.

48:08.151 --> 48:10.358
Let go of me!

48:26.920 --> 48:28.960
They're all gonna laugh at you!

48:29.673 --> 48:31.215
They're all gonna laugh at you!

48:31.967 --> 48:33.758
They're all gonna laugh at you!

48:34.219 --> 48:35.678
They're all gonna laugh at you!

48:46.562 --> 48:49.183
Selling used cars is not what I want.

48:50.190 --> 48:53.856
Unless I nail that football scholarship,
that's what I get.

48:54.737 --> 48:56.943
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

48:58.282 --> 49:01.733
I never told anybody this before in my life.

49:04.872 --> 49:08.407
It must be nice not having to be
like everybody else.

49:11.420 --> 49:14.172
It's not so great.

49:14.298 --> 49:15.958
I mean,

49:16.091 --> 49:20.504
sometimes I wish I could just be
one of the shiny, happy people.

49:23.057 --> 49:24.717
Does that surprise you?

49:24.850 --> 49:28.017
Yeah. Yeah.

49:28.145 --> 49:30.636
Everything about you surprises me.

49:47.665 --> 49:49.788
Whoa! Whoa!

49:53.837 --> 49:55.664
Um...

49:55.798 --> 49:59.712
I knew this guy once. He did this thing.

50:00.594 --> 50:03.002
He could suck a strand of spaghetti

50:03.138 --> 50:06.673
up his mouth and right out of his nose.

50:06.809 --> 50:08.351
Brain flossing?

50:09.561 --> 50:11.601
He called it a talent.

50:13.565 --> 50:17.515
I bet you're wondering
where I'm going with this, right?

50:18.904 --> 50:19.983
Well...

50:22.032 --> 50:23.491
you really have a talent.

50:23.617 --> 50:25.491
You've got football.

50:26.537 --> 50:30.997
It'll get you out of this place.
After that, you can do what you want.

50:31.125 --> 50:34.659
Make your own path.
Write your own book.

50:34.795 --> 50:36.586
Think so?

50:36.714 --> 50:38.172
Word.

50:38.299 --> 50:39.793
Word?

50:39.925 --> 50:41.123
Word.

50:41.552 --> 50:42.548
Word.

50:44.972 --> 50:47.297
You wanna come with me?

51:14.293 --> 51:15.917
What?

51:17.379 --> 51:22.718
Uh... your brake.
It's poking me right in the back.

51:24.553 --> 51:26.344
You wanna?

51:27.097 --> 51:29.339
Uh...

51:32.895 --> 51:35.812
I really don't know how to say this.

51:35.939 --> 51:37.932
What?

51:38.067 --> 51:39.810
I've never...

51:40.986 --> 51:42.231
Oh.

51:42.863 --> 51:44.357
Oh!

51:44.490 --> 51:45.865
Yeah.

51:48.077 --> 51:51.861
- And I want it to be special.
- Yeah.

51:51.997 --> 51:57.158
Like, you come to my door
with flowers in your hand.

51:59.338 --> 52:02.125
Oh, well, okay.

52:05.260 --> 52:08.178
What kind of flowers do you like?

52:10.474 --> 52:13.012
- Daisies.
- Daisies.

52:13.143 --> 52:14.139
Yeah.

52:14.269 --> 52:16.346
Okay. I'll have to remember that.

52:24.944 --> 52:26.486
I don't know!

52:26.612 --> 52:28.652
I don't know! I don't know!

52:28.948 --> 52:30.987
I don't know! I don't know!

52:31.408 --> 52:33.448
I don't know! I don't know!

52:33.661 --> 52:34.657
I don't know!

52:34.954 --> 52:37.409
I don't know! I don't know!

52:37.540 --> 52:40.541
I don't know! I don't know!

52:41.794 --> 52:46.420
Mrs Lang, I need to ask you
a few questions about Rachel.

52:47.466 --> 52:49.589
Who is...

52:49.718 --> 52:53.384
- Who is her father?
- It ain't important.

52:53.514 --> 52:57.381
- I knew you'd come back.
- I'm afraid we don't know each other.

52:57.518 --> 52:59.641
We can still get married.
I'll marry you.

52:59.770 --> 53:03.139
- I need to know who he is.
- I'm sorry, that's private.

53:03.274 --> 53:05.847
The hell with them!
What do they know?

53:06.777 --> 53:10.146
Cut it out! She's not Terry!
Now kindly go away.

53:14.034 --> 53:17.783
He's never had a visitor.
Wants to share everybody else's.

53:21.167 --> 53:23.455
Mrs Lang, it's very important

53:23.586 --> 53:27.583
that you tell me who Rachel's father is.

53:27.715 --> 53:30.004
I don't see how that's
any of your business.

53:30.134 --> 53:35.045
I'm trying to help Rachel. She seems
troubled and I'm very worried about her.

53:35.890 --> 53:39.259
You're worried?
Are you very worried?

53:39.393 --> 53:40.674
I am.

53:40.811 --> 53:43.646
You don't have any children,
do you, miss?

53:43.773 --> 53:45.979
No. No, I don't.

53:49.111 --> 53:54.318
Then you don't know. You will never know
how terrifying children can be.

53:55.409 --> 53:58.992
Mrs Lang, I know this is
a really strange question,

53:59.121 --> 54:00.995
but when Rachel was growing up

54:01.123 --> 54:04.160
did you ever see objects
move by themselves?

54:05.920 --> 54:08.790
And did the doctors convince you
it was your imagination?

54:08.923 --> 54:11.627
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord
is with thee. No. I was crazy then.

54:11.759 --> 54:15.673
I thought she was possessed.
I thought the devil was inside her.

54:15.805 --> 54:19.090
Mrs Lang, Rachel needs help.

54:19.225 --> 54:22.594
She may have a disease,
a genetic disorder.

54:22.728 --> 54:26.512
I believe her father
may have passed it on to her.

54:26.649 --> 54:30.349
- Could I have it? Did I give it to her?
- No.

54:30.486 --> 54:33.059
- How do you know?
- The male is the carrier.

54:33.197 --> 54:36.566
Mrs Lang, you must tell me his name.

54:38.327 --> 54:41.245
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners

54:41.372 --> 54:43.827
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

54:46.710 --> 54:49.166
I did tell Rachel once how we met.

54:50.881 --> 54:52.921
He said it was love at first sight.

54:54.593 --> 54:58.543
I'll tell you, but don't you dare
hurt my daughter.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.680
I never told her, cos

55:01.809 --> 55:05.676
people around here aren't fond of
Carrie White, cos of what she did.

55:05.813 --> 55:07.473
See,

55:07.606 --> 55:10.311
he was her daddy, too.

55:11.402 --> 55:13.478
His name was Ralph.

55:14.822 --> 55:17.313
Ralph White.

55:24.874 --> 55:26.582
Rachel?

55:27.918 --> 55:30.077
I need you to come with me.

55:37.845 --> 55:39.884
The night of the prom

55:41.682 --> 55:44.303
73 people died.

55:46.187 --> 55:48.938
A few of us survived, but

55:49.064 --> 55:51.602
we've never talked about that night.

55:55.863 --> 55:59.314
That's why I ended up at Arkham,
if you wondered.

55:59.450 --> 56:03.400
I witnessed something
I can't even begin to tell you about.

56:03.537 --> 56:06.657
But look around. See for yourself.

56:06.791 --> 56:09.364
This was the original high school.

56:10.544 --> 56:13.035
I wish they'd tear it down.
It's like some

56:13.172 --> 56:15.959
twisted memorial to that night.

56:18.803 --> 56:21.175
I haven't been here in over 20 years.

56:22.348 --> 56:23.842
Happy homecoming.

56:24.642 --> 56:26.800
You've heard of Carrie White?

56:27.645 --> 56:31.939
Supposedly she set the fire
as some type of

56:32.066 --> 56:34.639
revenge-suicide thing.

56:34.777 --> 56:37.944
Elvis was her date,
and they escaped in a UFO.

56:41.033 --> 56:44.484
I know what happened
to that snow dome on my desk.

56:46.247 --> 56:48.120
It fell.

56:48.249 --> 56:50.407
We both know.

56:54.630 --> 56:57.964
Rachel, is Jesse Ryan pressuring you...

56:58.092 --> 57:00.131
- That's none of your business.
- Look...

57:00.261 --> 57:03.594
I know everything there is to know
about Carrie White.

57:05.933 --> 57:06.846
She did this.

57:08.936 --> 57:13.931
It began with something like the snow
dome and then it got out of control.

57:14.066 --> 57:16.225
I'm leaving.

57:16.360 --> 57:17.190
Rachel...

57:17.319 --> 57:19.277
Rachel, it's...

57:19.405 --> 57:22.904
- It's a genetic recessive trait.
- What are you saying I have?

57:23.033 --> 57:27.245
I'm saying you're not crazy,
and it's not the devil.

57:27.371 --> 57:30.491
It's a trait, Rachel, you've inherited.

57:30.624 --> 57:34.325
Telekinesis. The ability
to move objects with your mind.

57:35.546 --> 57:38.298
For years I didn't believe it existed.

57:38.424 --> 57:42.753
There are places that study it. There's
a lab at Princeton. I can take you there.

57:42.887 --> 57:44.926
With all respect, lady,

57:45.055 --> 57:47.891
you are seriously batshit!

57:48.017 --> 57:50.093
I'm walking back to the real world.

57:50.227 --> 57:53.264
Your mother told me your father
is Carrie's father.

57:53.397 --> 57:56.102
No, my father's name was Bill Kirk.

57:56.233 --> 57:59.187
- He left when I was three months old.
- It's a lie.

57:59.320 --> 58:00.980
My mother wouldn't lie to me.

58:01.113 --> 58:03.236
Believe me, you need help.

58:03.365 --> 58:05.607
Like they helped you?

58:05.743 --> 58:08.863
I can help you to get it under control.

58:08.996 --> 58:12.199
I don't want or need your help.

58:15.057 --> 58:15.683
You're not thinking of
pressing charges against my son?

58:15.683 --> 58:18.352
You're not thinking of
pressing charges against my son?

58:18.477 --> 58:20.470
We're doing more than thinking.

58:20.605 --> 58:27.106
Look, Eric's a good kid. He may be guilty
of some youthful transgressions...

58:27.236 --> 58:30.854
Youthful transgressions?
A girl killed herself, Lou.

58:32.408 --> 58:33.688
Hello, Jay.

58:33.826 --> 58:36.364
Sit. Everybody sit.

58:36.495 --> 58:39.033
I'm just listening in.

58:39.165 --> 58:40.540
Okay, then.

58:41.334 --> 58:43.373
Cards on the table.

58:44.212 --> 58:46.667
My boy isn't going down alone.

58:46.797 --> 58:48.256
Go on.

58:53.387 --> 58:57.255
Mark Bing, Jesse Ryan,
Brad Winters and Chuck Potter.

58:58.226 --> 59:01.429
The most prominent families in this town.

59:02.480 --> 59:05.849
Maybe they've all slept
with underage girls. Who can tell?

59:05.983 --> 59:08.901
And, yes, maybe they made a game of it.

59:09.028 --> 59:11.104
Perhaps Eric can get proof of that.

59:11.239 --> 59:13.397
I agree it would be awful,

59:13.532 --> 59:15.525
but I don't think it's criminal.

59:17.245 --> 59:20.080
There will be scouts
at the game on Friday.

59:20.206 --> 59:22.779
Eric takes a fall, maybe they all will.

59:22.917 --> 59:25.918
You wanna be responsible
for ruining their lives?

59:27.547 --> 59:32.292
That sums it up. Karen, what we
have here is an issue with intent.

59:32.426 --> 59:34.585
- Blue-sheet it.
- Oh, but, Jay...

59:34.720 --> 59:38.884
You don't have evidence enough
to tarnish this boy's reputation.

59:39.016 --> 59:43.394
It's not about evidence, is it, Jay?
It's about elections, right?

59:43.521 --> 59:45.679
That is it, Robbie. That is all.

59:45.815 --> 59:50.275
Lou, thanks for coming by.
I'll walk you out.

59:50.403 --> 59:52.027
Appreciate it.

59:52.154 --> 59:54.313
I hope we see you at the game.

01:00:00.093 --> 01:00:03.343
- Hey, is this seat taken?
- No.

01:00:05.973 --> 01:00:08.974
- What's goin' on?
- Just studying.

01:00:10.061 --> 01:00:12.469
You gonna come to the game Friday?

01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:18.061
I don't really do football.

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:23.105
It's the season opener. There's gonna
be some scouts. I need you, for luck.

01:00:28.746 --> 01:00:33.657
If he's gonna be seen in public with
someone, he should show some respect.

01:00:33.793 --> 01:00:37.625
He should show me the respect
at least to be seen with someone pretty.

01:00:37.755 --> 01:00:39.795
Someone cool, someone who counts.

01:00:39.924 --> 01:00:42.130
You know, someone.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:46.838
But instead it's her.
And I just feel totally...

01:00:46.973 --> 01:00:48.348
Disrespected!

01:00:48.474 --> 01:00:50.266
Yeah.

01:00:50.393 --> 01:00:52.516
You're being seriously dissed.

01:00:52.645 --> 01:00:56.809
I wish there was something I could do
to make him come to his senses.

01:00:57.692 --> 01:01:00.099
Mark's got his wheels turning!

01:01:00.236 --> 01:01:02.276
What?

01:01:02.655 --> 01:01:04.482
What?

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.617
Good lift.

01:01:14.876 --> 01:01:17.960
Come on. Good lift. Good lift. Good lift.

01:01:23.343 --> 01:01:27.672
One more. Push it out, man.
Come on, push it, push it.

01:01:27.805 --> 01:01:29.762
Nice!

01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:34.558
Hey...

01:01:36.439 --> 01:01:39.440
Look, man, I'm sorry.
I guess I overreacted.

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:42.568
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man.

01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:47.074
We've been friends since
we were both dumpin' our drawers.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.738
I thought we'd be best friends for ever.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:01:54.162
Never figured some girl
would come in the way of that.

01:01:56.125 --> 01:02:00.205
Look, I know I'm scum.
I'm prepared to admit that.

01:02:00.338 --> 01:02:04.964
I'm lower than scum.
I'm smegma. I'm butt lint.

01:02:05.093 --> 01:02:07.500
- Keep going.
- I'm a prick, an asshole.

01:02:07.637 --> 01:02:09.926
- Asshole, yeah.
- Is that good?

01:02:10.056 --> 01:02:12.345
I'm sorry, man.

01:02:14.352 --> 01:02:17.555
I'm not the one
you should be apologising to.

01:02:17.689 --> 01:02:19.728
I know.

01:02:28.199 --> 01:02:31.366
Karen, watch my counter, please.

01:02:37.667 --> 01:02:41.367
- Can I help you?
- Um...

01:02:41.504 --> 01:02:45.122
Just... Just looking. Thanks.

01:02:58.646 --> 01:02:59.642
Hi!

01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:03.480
Mrs Porter, this is a friend of mine.

01:03:10.616 --> 01:03:12.574
I thought she was gonna frisk me.

01:03:12.702 --> 01:03:14.860
She does step class with my mom.

01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:19.239
So, what are you shopping for?

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:21.534
Oh, nothing. Just looking.

01:03:21.669 --> 01:03:26.165
Perhaps something to wear on a date?
With a certain jock hunk we all know?

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.257
No... No.

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:32.798
You know, Tracy isn't universally loved.

01:03:34.098 --> 01:03:35.592
There's a shocker.

01:03:36.642 --> 01:03:39.596
Exhibit A.
She tried to steal Brad from me.

01:03:39.729 --> 01:03:41.722
She's a Melrose Place superbitch.

01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:47.893
You have got great lips!

01:03:48.321 --> 01:03:54.074
Really. Look. This shade will look
very kissable and soft. Come here.

01:03:57.121 --> 01:03:58.615
Trust me, okay?

01:03:58.748 --> 01:04:01.535
Hold still.

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:04.953
Are you going to the game?
Just blink once for yes.

01:04:07.465 --> 01:04:10.501
Great, cos there's a big party
afterwards. I hope you can go.

01:04:12.637 --> 01:04:14.511
I don't think so.

01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:17.344
Oh, come on. You really should.
For Jesse.

01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:20.048
It'd mean a lot to him if we all got along.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:21.969
Uh-huh?

01:04:22.105 --> 01:04:25.556
Yeah. So you'll go?

01:04:27.276 --> 01:04:29.316
Great! See?

01:04:33.533 --> 01:04:35.905
Can I ring that up for you?

01:04:36.035 --> 01:04:38.906
Sure. How much is it?

01:04:39.038 --> 01:04:41.245
$22. 50.

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:45.240
Oh, um, maybe next time.

01:04:45.378 --> 01:04:47.370
Thanks, Mrs Porter.

01:04:51.884 --> 01:04:53.924
I kleptoed it for you.

01:04:55.888 --> 01:04:57.715
- Jesse!
- Hey!

01:04:57.849 --> 01:05:00.636
Figured out how to make it up
to you and Rachel.

01:05:01.894 --> 01:05:05.429
The summer house.
My parents aren't gonna be there.

01:05:05.565 --> 01:05:09.265
I figured you wanted to get away
from us idiots for a while.

01:05:09.402 --> 01:05:12.272
Have a nice romantic time.
All right?

01:05:13.364 --> 01:05:15.902
But you're gonna bring her by my party.

01:05:16.034 --> 01:05:18.571
So I can apologise to her, all right?

01:05:18.703 --> 01:05:22.748
Then we can all be
one big happy family again.

01:05:22.874 --> 01:05:25.543
- All right?
- Okay.

01:05:26.753 --> 01:05:28.792
Have a good time, man.

01:06:54.966 --> 01:06:57.338
- You look great.
- Thanks.

01:06:57.468 --> 01:06:59.544
I really like your hair.

01:07:00.805 --> 01:07:05.597
Oh, you can just, you know,
throw those in the back or something.

01:07:09.981 --> 01:07:12.187
Mark can be a jerk,

01:07:12.316 --> 01:07:16.694
but he's trying. He's got
a party Friday, and he invited us.

01:07:16.821 --> 01:07:19.110
- We won't go if you don't want to. 
- Let's go.

01:07:39.918 --> 01:07:42.491
Um... Uh...

01:07:42.629 --> 01:07:44.289
What's wrong?

01:07:44.423 --> 01:07:46.462
I'm just

01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:48.965
a little scared.

01:07:49.094 --> 01:07:51.336
Don't be scared.

01:07:51.471 --> 01:07:56.133
I know. I just feel kind of strange.

01:08:01.815 --> 01:08:05.599
Look, we don't have to do this tonight.

01:08:05.736 --> 01:08:07.858
Whenever you're ready.

01:08:13.785 --> 01:08:17.734
God, I must be crazy.

01:08:17.872 --> 01:08:23.328
Actually, you're...
about the sanest person I know.

01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:27.834
Whoa!

01:08:28.341 --> 01:08:29.752
Wow!

01:08:31.428 --> 01:08:33.966
You're sane. You're sane.

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:20.598
I love you.

01:09:45.133 --> 01:09:47.754
You're grounded. For a week!

01:09:47.886 --> 01:09:51.420
- But I've gotta go to the game...
- You wanna make it two?

01:09:52.724 --> 01:09:54.681
You stay in this room.

01:09:55.768 --> 01:09:58.057
Am I clear?

01:09:59.230 --> 01:10:01.270
Yes, sir.

01:10:22.959 --> 01:10:25.711
Come on! Shave it off!

01:10:31.051 --> 01:10:32.842
Hey, man!

01:10:34.304 --> 01:10:37.056
Hey, you're next! Get in the chair!

01:10:37.182 --> 01:10:39.139
- Come on!
- Come on, bro!

01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:40.642
Come on, man!

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.808
You're gonna ruin the whole effect!

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:46.141
Oh, Jess, where's your sac?
Come on!

01:11:10.036 --> 01:11:13.156
You have to tell her who her father is.

01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:16.410
- Why?
- Because she'll believe it from you.

01:11:16.543 --> 01:11:19.912
Rachel needs to seek treatment
before it's too late.

01:11:20.964 --> 01:11:23.004
Too late for what?

01:11:24.885 --> 01:11:27.886
Rachel's best friend committed suicide.

01:11:29.431 --> 01:11:31.258
I'm afraid Rachel may

01:11:31.391 --> 01:11:33.431
harm herself

01:11:34.227 --> 01:11:36.184
or others.

01:11:39.024 --> 01:11:43.104
And you wanna take me... out there?

01:11:43.236 --> 01:11:44.896
Yes.

01:11:51.633 --> 01:11:53.507
He saw me!

01:11:53.635 --> 01:11:55.675
Go get 'em, baby!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.385
Welcome to today's match-up

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:02.470
between Bates Bulldogs
and the Carlin Devils.

01:12:02.603 --> 01:12:07.348
It's the first game for both teams as the
Bulldogs seek their 7 th championship.

01:12:07.482 --> 01:12:10.816
There's a history of bad blood
between these teams

01:12:10.944 --> 01:12:14.527
as the Devils have consistently
been a thorn in the Bulldogs' side.

01:12:14.656 --> 01:12:18.025
Let's hope the Dawgs can
pull that thorn out once and for all

01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.529
as the special teams get set
for the opening kick-off.

01:12:21.663 --> 01:12:24.783
Number 42 of the Bulldogs, 
Chuck Potter, receiving the kick.

01:12:27.961 --> 01:12:29.753
Oh, my! He's popped!

01:12:31.757 --> 01:12:34.426
Could I have my purse, please?

01:12:34.551 --> 01:12:35.962
Oh.

01:12:43.602 --> 01:12:46.472
Just about five minutes to go now
in the second quarter.

01:12:48.774 --> 01:12:53.186
A vicious hit by Stark. 
Johnson, number 45, isn't getting up.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.938
- What kind of call was that?
- It looks like number 33, Stark,

01:12:57.074 --> 01:13:00.656
is being ejected
for a flagrant personal foul.

01:13:00.786 --> 01:13:03.075
What the hell is he fuckin' doing?

01:13:03.205 --> 01:13:07.250
- That was not a flagrant foul!
- 33 has been disqualified.

01:13:07.376 --> 01:13:10.045
Why don't I just take
every starter out for you!

01:13:14.132 --> 01:13:16.802
Touchdown, Devils!

01:13:16.927 --> 01:13:21.007
The Bulldogs are trailing in the second
half as they receive the Devils'punt.

01:13:21.139 --> 01:13:25.054
Number 42, Chuck Potter, 
takes the kick again for the Dawgs.

01:13:25.185 --> 01:13:27.392
And there he goes

01:13:27.521 --> 01:13:30.557
cutting across the field, 
racing down the sideline!

01:13:38.031 --> 01:13:40.154
Fourth quarter action. Here's the snap.

01:13:40.284 --> 01:13:43.984
A quick pass to Jesse Ryan, 
and, oooh, he was hit hard!

01:13:44.121 --> 01:13:48.035
What a pop! He is down.

01:13:48.166 --> 01:13:50.836
He is not getting up right away.

01:13:55.465 --> 01:13:58.799
Wait a minute. I see... 
I see movement.

01:13:58.927 --> 01:14:01.881
Yes, he's finally moving now. 
He's up.

01:14:02.556 --> 01:14:05.094
Shaking it off. And there he goes.

01:14:06.727 --> 01:14:10.974
Everything's so different,
so very different.

01:14:11.106 --> 01:14:13.348
Things change.

01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:16.021
There's Mr Bellows.
Hello, George!

01:14:17.446 --> 01:14:19.320
He always had an eye for me.

01:14:19.448 --> 01:14:22.568
- Where?
- Right there.

01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:24.952
Hello, George!

01:14:27.789 --> 01:14:29.663
Devils suck!

01:14:29.791 --> 01:14:32.199
It's pretty much do-or-die time now.

01:14:32.336 --> 01:14:35.372
The Dawgs down by 4, 
with 12 seconds left on the clock.

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.415
It's been a struggle for the Dawgs,

01:14:37.549 --> 01:14:40.752
trying to move the ball
against the stingy Devils defence.

01:14:40.886 --> 01:14:43.507
This is not how
the Dawgs wanted it to come out.

01:14:43.639 --> 01:14:45.631
They've had a tough time on defence.

01:14:45.766 --> 01:14:48.969
- They're not moving the ball as usual. 
- Ryan, come here.

01:14:49.102 --> 01:14:52.886
All right, son, trips right,
crazy eight. Let's go.

01:14:53.023 --> 01:14:57.732
They're taking their time here. 
Probably their last play of the game.

01:14:57.861 --> 01:15:00.150
Trips right, crazy eight.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:03.981
Go! Go, Bulldogs!

01:15:06.954 --> 01:15:09.195
Hey, come back here!

01:15:12.876 --> 01:15:17.170
Last chance. We'll look for a Hail Mary. 
We've got Jesse Ryan set wide.

01:15:17.297 --> 01:15:19.337
Bulldogs set. There's the snap.

01:15:19.466 --> 01:15:22.171
A long bomb down towards the corner.

01:15:22.302 --> 01:15:25.885
Ryan is there. He's under it. 
He jumps. He's got it!

01:15:26.014 --> 01:15:26.796
Complete!

01:15:26.932 --> 01:15:30.016
Touchdown, Bulldogs!

01:15:30.143 --> 01:15:31.721
The Bulldogs win it!

01:15:33.188 --> 01:15:36.937
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, baby! Yeah!

01:15:42.948 --> 01:15:44.739
Yeah! Yeah!

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.108
Whoo-hoo!

01:15:50.414 --> 01:15:51.991
Jesse!

01:15:52.374 --> 01:15:53.749
Jesse!

01:16:12.107 --> 01:16:16.319
Ryan! Ryan.
College scout wants to talk to you.

01:16:16.445 --> 01:16:17.939
Hi.

01:16:18.072 --> 01:16:19.447
Brad.

01:16:19.573 --> 01:16:20.569
Yeah?

01:16:20.699 --> 01:16:23.369
Could you tell Rachel to wait for me?

01:16:23.494 --> 01:16:27.076
No problem. And hey... good luck.

01:16:27.206 --> 01:16:28.830
Thanks.

01:16:33.796 --> 01:16:36.121
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hey.

01:16:36.256 --> 01:16:38.296
- Hi, Monica.
- Hey!

01:16:39.176 --> 01:16:41.548
Jesse's talking with a scout.

01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:44.216
- He said to go ahead to the party.
- You hear that?

01:16:44.348 --> 01:16:46.257
A scout. Isn't that great?

01:16:46.392 --> 01:16:49.262
- Yeah, that's great.
- All right.

01:16:50.354 --> 01:16:52.927
I'm goin' with the guys.
See you there.

01:16:53.065 --> 01:16:55.223
Come on.
I'll give you a ride to Mark's.

01:16:55.359 --> 01:16:57.398
- Thanks.
- Deborah!

01:17:02.199 --> 01:17:04.441
Dress. Dress. Dress time!

01:17:06.078 --> 01:17:08.699
- Try this.
- Thanks.

01:17:12.751 --> 01:17:14.910
Mascara. Mascara!

01:17:15.045 --> 01:17:16.456
Sorry.

01:17:28.225 --> 01:17:30.550
Done. How do I look?

01:17:30.686 --> 01:17:32.560
- Beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:17:32.688 --> 01:17:34.348
- You look good.
- You, too.

01:17:34.481 --> 01:17:36.972
- You look really pretty.
- You need lipstick.

01:17:38.318 --> 01:17:40.525
Yo, check it out.

01:17:47.786 --> 01:17:49.909
Goddamn it!

01:17:50.914 --> 01:17:52.954
Whoa, that sucks!

01:17:53.083 --> 01:17:55.076
They even slashed my tyres.

01:17:55.210 --> 01:17:58.745
Further proof the Devils
are just a bunch of pigs, huh?

01:17:58.881 --> 01:18:01.419
- Are you looking for Rachel?
- Yeah.

01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:03.708
She's at Mark's. You want a ride?

01:18:11.769 --> 01:18:14.604
I just have to stop by my place real quick.

01:18:23.238 --> 01:18:25.646
- Have you seen Rachel Lang?
- Who?

01:18:25.783 --> 01:18:29.780
- Rachel Lang. Was she at the game?
- Oh, yeah. With the tattoo.

01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:31.951
I saw her leave with Monica Jones.

01:18:32.081 --> 01:18:34.619
I guess they went to Mark Bing's party.

01:18:34.750 --> 01:18:36.826
Rachel with Monica?

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:48.424
Just go away!
Todd, get off my butt!

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:50.180
Stop!

01:18:51.767 --> 01:18:54.803
Whoa, bro, what are you doing?

01:18:54.937 --> 01:18:57.606
You bust something,
heads are gonna roll.

01:19:00.693 --> 01:19:03.362
Whoo-hoo!

01:19:07.032 --> 01:19:09.867
Yes! Yes!

01:19:14.081 --> 01:19:16.239
Rachel, yo.

01:19:16.375 --> 01:19:18.533
You could get me into this party, right?

01:19:18.669 --> 01:19:20.958
Arnie, we'll come back for you.

01:19:21.088 --> 01:19:22.368
I told you.

01:19:22.506 --> 01:19:24.249
In a couple of years!

01:19:24.383 --> 01:19:26.625
How come she gets to go in, then?

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:30.592
- She's one of us.
- I'll try and get you in, Arnie!

01:19:31.932 --> 01:19:35.135
Fuck that. Come on,
let's do some serious doughnuts.

01:19:35.269 --> 01:19:37.724
Come on. Hit it! Whoo!

01:19:39.648 --> 01:19:41.440
Then the scout said

01:19:41.567 --> 01:19:45.434
"I love your aggressive play.
You have that killer instinct. "

01:19:45.571 --> 01:19:47.362
Great. For you, that's great.

01:19:49.533 --> 01:19:53.483
- There she is. You better disappear.
- No problem.

01:19:59.626 --> 01:20:00.825
Swank!

01:20:09.178 --> 01:20:13.175
Relax. They just need to get to know you
for who you really are.

01:20:13.307 --> 01:20:15.880
- How about a drink?
- Right on.

01:20:22.775 --> 01:20:24.898
What can I get you beautiful ladies?

01:20:25.027 --> 01:20:28.111
- Some margaritas would be nice.
- Okay.

01:20:29.156 --> 01:20:30.319
- B-rad.
- Yo!

01:20:30.449 --> 01:20:32.821
- Margaritas.
- Comin'!

01:20:35.871 --> 01:20:38.444
- Thanks.
- I'm glad you could make it.

01:20:38.582 --> 01:20:40.539
Sorry about the other night.

01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:44.037
It was just a bunch of guys
being guys. I'm sorry.

01:20:45.089 --> 01:20:47.710
Jesse told us to cool it and explain.

01:20:47.841 --> 01:20:49.881
So, no hard feelings? Peace?

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:53.462
Well, as long as you
pour me a drink, all right.

01:20:53.597 --> 01:20:54.926
Sho'.

01:20:56.058 --> 01:20:57.303
Thanks.

01:20:57.434 --> 01:20:58.976
To new friends, then?

01:21:01.563 --> 01:21:03.390
- Drink to that.
- Okay.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.670
Tracy, I appreciate the ride, but let's go.

01:21:10.803 --> 01:21:14.136
I'm trying to figure out what to wear.

01:21:14.265 --> 01:21:16.672
Of course.

01:21:19.478 --> 01:21:21.720
Hey, what do you think of this?

01:21:21.856 --> 01:21:23.848
- Looks good.
- Really?

01:21:23.983 --> 01:21:24.978
Yeah.

01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:30.317
Well, I don't know.
I think it might be a bit much.

01:21:31.365 --> 01:21:32.646
Don't you?

01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:37.743
We're gonna be late.

01:21:39.957 --> 01:21:41.866
Pretty soon she won't care.

01:21:42.001 --> 01:21:43.495
What's that?

01:21:44.587 --> 01:21:48.287
If she cares about you,
she won't mind if you're late.

01:21:53.526 --> 01:21:54.068
- Come on, wench, let's dance!
- Don't you "wench" me!

01:21:54.068 --> 01:21:56.393
- Come on, wench, let's dance!
- Don't you "wench" me!

01:22:05.663 --> 01:22:07.371
Rachel, let's dance.

01:22:07.498 --> 01:22:09.656
I think I'd rather wait for Jesse.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:12.828
- He'd want you to have fun.
- Come on, have some fun.

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:15.963
Yeah, come on, Rach.
I got you, babe. Come on.

01:22:16.591 --> 01:22:18.168
Go, Rachel!

01:22:33.441 --> 01:22:34.436
Whoa!

01:22:47.705 --> 01:22:51.489
Hey, Mark, I got a little present
for you, right here.

01:22:51.626 --> 01:22:53.535
Mark, you like the game footage?

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:56.587
I love the footage. Yes, I do!

01:22:56.714 --> 01:22:58.707
Are you talking about today's game?

01:22:58.841 --> 01:23:00.881
No, about the other game.

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:03.168
What other game?

01:23:03.304 --> 01:23:06.969
- The game that you're in. My turn.
- Yeah?

01:23:07.099 --> 01:23:10.682
- The game you played, Rachel.
- Right. What was the score?

01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:13.053
Grab that scorebook. I wanna see it.

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:16.392
- Want to see it now? All right.
- Come here, baby.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:19.562
I wanna show you how you
helped Jesse win the game.

01:23:20.988 --> 01:23:23.277
Two-twenty-four!
Hut, hut, hut, hut!

01:23:25.284 --> 01:23:26.613
Whoo!

01:23:29.997 --> 01:23:31.242
Whoo!

01:23:31.916 --> 01:23:32.912
Rachel!

01:23:33.042 --> 01:23:34.501
Catch!

01:23:36.254 --> 01:23:38.211
Yeah, baby!

01:23:38.339 --> 01:23:39.667
Yeah!

01:23:40.424 --> 01:23:42.464
Hold it! I gotta get my camera.

01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:45.050
- Read off the scores.
- Hold on.

01:23:46.305 --> 01:23:49.390
Come on, Rachel! Read the scores!

01:23:49.517 --> 01:23:54.262
Let's start with Eric's scores
cos it's gonna be so sad.

01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:56.436
Start with poor Eric.

01:23:59.151 --> 01:24:02.402
What's the matter? Is there
someone in there you recognise?

01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:05.151
Someone you know? Huh?

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:14.959
Ahh, Lisa!

01:24:15.209 --> 01:24:17.202
I forgot about Lisa.

01:24:17.336 --> 01:24:18.451
Eric!

01:24:18.588 --> 01:24:20.829
Come on down!

01:24:20.965 --> 01:24:23.919
There's our brother!
The DA kissed his butt!

01:24:27.763 --> 01:24:30.717
- We were just talking about Lisa.
- Oh, Lisa!

01:24:30.850 --> 01:24:33.257
How was she?

01:24:33.394 --> 01:24:36.181
To be honest,
I just about split her in two!

01:24:44.572 --> 01:24:46.149
How many points was she?

01:24:46.282 --> 01:24:49.651
Four, but we should deduct those
since she offed herself.

01:24:49.785 --> 01:24:54.780
Wait. Think of how many points he'd have
got if he'd done her after she was dead.

01:24:54.916 --> 01:24:56.955
- A bit cold, huh?
- Chuck, come on!

01:24:57.084 --> 01:25:00.785
Rach, baby, read that.
Open it up to Jesse's page.

01:25:00.922 --> 01:25:03.757
I want you to see how many points

01:25:03.883 --> 01:25:06.041
Jesse got for you!

01:25:06.177 --> 01:25:09.427
I think that'll be about a two-four-six-eight!

01:25:09.555 --> 01:25:11.215
Who do we appreciate!

01:25:11.349 --> 01:25:16.307
Remember, you said you were a dyke,
so extra points for the conversion.

01:25:16.437 --> 01:25:19.557
Oh, the conversion! Two points!

01:25:19.690 --> 01:25:21.564
Not two. Thirty!

01:25:21.692 --> 01:25:24.479
Thirty?! You gave her thirty?!

01:25:25.446 --> 01:25:28.780
She should get extra points,
being so skanky.

01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:34.454
Look.

01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:37.949
Look at that. Look at it.

01:25:43.339 --> 01:25:45.332
We didn't think Jesse could do it.

01:25:46.050 --> 01:25:49.419
- So he offered to get us proof.
- How do you like Jesse's big play?

01:25:49.553 --> 01:25:53.931
Lookie, lookie here, Rachel! Lookie here!

01:25:54.058 --> 01:25:57.474
- They're all gonna laugh at you!
- Was it good for ya?

01:25:59.146 --> 01:26:03.227
- Is that you?
- They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:26:05.278 --> 01:26:06.523
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:26:06.654 --> 01:26:09.275
Was it good, Rachel!
Was it good, Rachel!

01:26:09.407 --> 01:26:11.115
They're all gonna laugh at you!

01:26:25.965 --> 01:26:27.957
Sucker! Sucker! Sucker!

01:26:35.308 --> 01:26:38.059
Hey, is that a zit on your ass?

01:26:38.185 --> 01:26:41.056
It is! It is a zit on her ass!

01:26:41.188 --> 01:26:43.679
No, that's a mole.

01:26:43.816 --> 01:26:45.310
Holy shit.

01:26:48.279 --> 01:26:51.695
- Mark, what's going on?
- I have no idea.

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:30.444
Rachel!

01:27:31.822 --> 01:27:33.400
Out of my way!

01:27:33.532 --> 01:27:36.154
- Hey!
- Brad, you bastard!

01:28:14.323 --> 01:28:17.906
- Get out of the way! Move it!
- Shit! It won't open!

01:28:21.038 --> 01:28:23.576
Holy shit, dude! It's her doing it!

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:24.621
Go!

01:28:37.930 --> 01:28:40.053
Somebody put me out! Help!

01:28:41.434 --> 01:28:43.225
Oh, God, help me!

01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:45.475
Help me!

01:28:46.272 --> 01:28:47.766
Oh, my God!

01:28:49.692 --> 01:28:51.400
Let me out!

01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:58.695
Man, we're missing one killer party.

01:29:02.538 --> 01:29:05.290
- Where are the fuckin' keys!
- Hurry!

01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:08.832
My stupid dad's always hiding
these friggin' keys!

01:29:15.259 --> 01:29:17.631
Tyler! Tyler, get up!

01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:19.879
- What's this?
- A spear gun, idiot.

01:29:20.014 --> 01:29:23.798
- Give me that shit.
- What will you do with a flare gun?!

01:29:34.779 --> 01:29:36.818
It's all my fault.

01:29:49.877 --> 01:29:51.917
Let's go! Get outta here!

01:29:52.046 --> 01:29:53.042
Oh, shit!

01:30:01.806 --> 01:30:04.427
Go on! Through the glass!
Come on!

01:30:07.937 --> 01:30:09.016
Get up!

01:30:12.024 --> 01:30:14.942
- Pull the cord!
- Where's the fuckin' cord!

01:30:40.803 --> 01:30:42.630
Oh, shit!

01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:55.146
Rachel!

01:30:55.276 --> 01:30:56.556
Mama?

01:32:51.183 --> 01:32:53.306
Rachel!

01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:59.394
Mama!

01:33:01.193 --> 01:33:03.863
- Oh!
- Rachel...

01:33:06.324 --> 01:33:08.400
What's wrong?

01:33:14.206 --> 01:33:16.080
Mama?

01:33:16.208 --> 01:33:18.367
What are you?

01:33:18.502 --> 01:33:20.744
You're not my little girl.

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:24.580
No! No, the devil's in you!

01:33:24.717 --> 01:33:28.418
- The devil's in you! The devil's in you!
- Mama!

01:33:28.554 --> 01:33:33.512
Mama, please! Please, Mama,
don't leave me! Don't leave me!

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.593
I don't have anyone!

01:33:45.321 --> 01:33:47.693
Please...

01:33:49.450 --> 01:33:51.359
Please...

01:33:52.536 --> 01:33:54.659
Please, God,

01:33:56.916 --> 01:33:58.908
let me die.

01:34:05.633 --> 01:34:08.088
Please...

01:34:09.887 --> 01:34:10.918
Rachel!

01:34:44.427 --> 01:34:49.552
Come on, she's dead! They're all dead!
We have to get out of here! Let's go!

01:34:51.184 --> 01:34:52.594
Oh, my God!

01:34:52.727 --> 01:34:54.684
Forget about that! Let's go!

01:34:54.812 --> 01:34:56.141
You used me.

01:34:56.272 --> 01:34:57.766
I had no idea!

01:34:57.899 --> 01:34:58.848
Liar!

01:35:02.487 --> 01:35:05.357
Is that all I was to you, Jesse?

01:35:05.490 --> 01:35:07.363
30 points?

01:35:07.492 --> 01:35:10.030
I'd never do that. Trust me.
I'd never hurt you.

01:35:10.161 --> 01:35:12.035
Stop lying!

01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:19.663
I believed you. You know that?

01:35:19.796 --> 01:35:20.910
God!

01:35:21.047 --> 01:35:23.086
I believed you.

01:35:23.216 --> 01:35:27.213
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I love you. I do.

01:35:27.345 --> 01:35:29.088
- Liar!
- I love you!

01:35:29.222 --> 01:35:31.214
I love you.

01:35:35.478 --> 01:35:37.186
I love you.

01:35:41.234 --> 01:35:42.609
I love you.

01:35:43.486 --> 01:35:44.517
I love you.
