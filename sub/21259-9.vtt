00:08.809 --> 00:11.212
From this humble
airfield,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
a journey of epic
proportions.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.616
These brave explorers
will make their way

00:15.649 --> 00:17.185
to Cape Canaveral

00:17.218 --> 00:19.320
for tomorrow's
historic launch of the

00:19.353 --> 00:22.156
first ever manned
mission to Mars.

00:22.190 --> 00:25.126
These pioneers
of space known as

00:25.159 --> 00:27.595
"The Mars 9" must
today say goodbye

00:27.628 --> 00:30.364
to their loved ones and
tomorrow to this

00:30.398 --> 00:34.268
spinning blue marble
we call Earth.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.306
[indistinct papparazzi
chatter]

00:42.643 --> 00:44.845
- Whenever you
look at the moon,

00:44.878 --> 00:49.150
just know that I'm looking
at the same moon.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.218
- Are you?

00:50.251 --> 00:54.655
I think Earth and Mars have
different moons, Baby.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.290
- What about the sun?

00:56.324 --> 01:00.494
- Same sun.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.538
These intrepid
men and women will depart

01:10.571 --> 01:14.442
not knowing when, or even if,
they will return.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.244
- Mrs. Von Webber,
over here.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.646
You look stunning.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.318
[theme song]
* Hey yes you know

01:24.352 --> 01:28.656
* I'm feeling fine
I'm feeling fine *

01:29.457 --> 01:32.260
- Welp, said goodbye
to Lex.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.128
I can't believe he's
really leaving.

01:34.162 --> 01:36.164
- I'm sorry, Honey.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.598
Could you use some
cheering up?

01:37.631 --> 01:40.901
- Yeah.
I know just the thing.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.204
(flirty)
- Great minds think alike.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.273
- Quality time with
the people I love.

01:45.306 --> 01:49.177
- Or person. We could really
use some reconnecting.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.244
- Exactly.

01:50.278 --> 01:52.213
That's why I signed
us all up for the sleepover

01:52.246 --> 01:54.348
at The Brewton Museum
of Natural History.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.484
- Wait, what?

01:56.517 --> 01:57.718
- The whole family.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.487
- No.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.922
- I mean, I love The Brewton
Museum but sleeping

02:01.955 --> 02:05.226
there with 1000 other
parents and their kids?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.294
I won't survive!

02:06.327 --> 02:08.496
You'll be visiting me in the
Hall of Extinction.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.631
- Isn't it a New York rite
of passage?

02:10.664 --> 02:12.366
- It's a nightmare.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.335
And, between work and
his Dad's Committee,

02:14.368 --> 02:16.404
Andy and I haven't
had sex in weeks.

02:16.437 --> 02:18.706
The other day I caught myself
winking at a zucchini.

02:18.739 --> 02:19.607
- At least you're not
Brooke,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.243
she's not getting any for
light-years.

02:22.276 --> 02:24.512
Am I the only one
who thinks Lex going to

02:24.545 --> 02:27.181
Mars is just a little
bit crazy?

02:27.215 --> 02:29.517
- It's insane.
Mars?!

02:29.550 --> 02:31.252
It takes eight months
just to get there

02:31.285 --> 02:32.620
and once you do
it's a life sentence

02:32.653 --> 02:34.655
of smelling other
people's farts.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.524
- Oh my God, I never
thought of that.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.193
- Yeah, you can't just
crack a window!

02:39.227 --> 02:41.962
I'd rather live in the
upside-down with a Demogorgon.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.763
- Hm?

02:42.796 --> 02:45.233
- "Stranger Things."
Binge pronto.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.467
- I'll watch it tonight.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.401
- You're not working?

02:47.435 --> 02:49.403
- Nope, my schedule got
shifted around.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.804
No more Fridays.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.540
- Okay, in that case,

02:52.573 --> 02:54.775
Forget Winona Ryder talking
to Christmas light.

02:54.808 --> 02:58.812
I all caps beggin you
come tonight, please.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.780
- Pass.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.315
It'll be fun if you
come!

03:01.349 --> 03:03.251
And you'll love it, it's
just like camping.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.453
- Minus the campfires,
and s'mores, nature,

03:05.486 --> 03:06.754
shooting stars.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.290
- Okay, I wasn't going to
do this,

03:09.323 --> 03:12.626
but desperate times...
you owe me.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.561
- For what???

03:13.594 --> 03:16.564
- for getting you laid, like
monster laid,

03:16.597 --> 03:19.400
with that hot rocker
dude in L.A.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.835
- Damn it,
that was an epic lay.

03:21.869 --> 03:26.206
[rock music]

03:32.780 --> 03:35.316
This is already the longest
night of my life.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.017
- Don't worry,
I packed us an array

03:37.050 --> 03:38.586
of essentials to get
us through.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.520
- You did?!

03:39.553 --> 03:41.522
- Yeah, camping sucks
if you don't bring all

03:41.555 --> 03:42.556
the comforts of home.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.659
I've got wine and booze -
wasn't sure what we'd

03:45.693 --> 03:49.430
be in the mood for -
sandwiches from Katz's Deli,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.465
some edibles I got from
a neighbor--

03:51.499 --> 03:54.668
- No drugs or alcohol.
No outside food.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.604
No smart phones or tablets.

03:56.637 --> 04:02.242
Please have your bags
open and ready for inspection.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.815
- You'll need to surrender
your phone, ma'am.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.419
- Just one last text.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.526
- You're the wife of one
of the Mars 9, right?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.428
The famous one,
from the paper?

04:20.461 --> 04:26.667
Yes, I'm Br--,
Mrs. Lex von Weber!

04:26.700 --> 04:28.402
- If you don't mind
me asking,

04:28.436 --> 04:30.371
how are you
holding up?

04:30.404 --> 04:31.439
- Never better!

04:31.472 --> 04:34.575
Other people sacrifice their
lives for our country.

04:34.608 --> 04:40.414
The least I can do is sacrifice
my husband.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.384
- It's not enough to
get us hammered

04:43.417 --> 04:44.518
but it'll at least take
the edge off so

04:44.552 --> 04:47.488
we don't beat ourselves
to death with a dinosaur bone.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.622
- Next.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.491
- Quick, he's not looking.
Put them in your pockets.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.092
- I don't have pockets!

04:52.125 --> 04:53.827
- Mine aren't big
enough.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.663
Andy, you have to
hide these

04:55.696 --> 04:58.366
Shove them up your
butthole, whatever it takes.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.800
- What? No! I can't
break the rules!

04:59.833 --> 05:02.436
Honey, I tried to sneak apple
slices into a movie

05:02.470 --> 05:05.473
theatre and the usher kept
glaring at me like he knew.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.608
I had to leave Passion
of the Christ halfway through.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.410
- Spoiler: he dies.

05:09.443 --> 05:13.714
- Do it!

05:13.747 --> 05:16.717
Next!?

05:17.585 --> 05:18.318
- Bet you get a
lot of people

05:18.352 --> 05:20.421
trying to smuggle
stuff in, huh?

05:20.454 --> 05:23.391
Rules are rules! Why don't
people get that?!

05:23.424 --> 05:27.428
- Sir, what's
that in your pockets?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.933
Every year there's a
trouble maker.

05:32.966 --> 05:36.470
I've got my eyes on you.?

05:50.551 --> 05:51.619
- Now we know what a
one percenters'

05:51.652 --> 05:53.621
refugee camp would
look like.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.389
- I'll drop the twins off
for story hour.

05:55.423 --> 05:57.725
Then Hazel, we'll start
the scavenger hunt.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.427
...Mom...

05:59.460 --> 06:01.795
Babe, why don't you run the
twins over then come back.

06:01.829 --> 06:04.732
We haven't hung out since we
got his and her flu shots.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.434
Plus, I think the
scavenger hunt

06:06.467 --> 06:08.602
is for the kids to do
with each other.

06:08.636 --> 06:09.837
It's for everyone!

06:09.870 --> 06:11.605
Let's head
over, kiddo!

06:11.639 --> 06:13.607
Come on.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.409
- Check out bubble mom.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.744
- Are those adult diapers?

06:16.777 --> 06:19.713
Oh my god yes! I thought she
was an urban legend!

06:19.747 --> 06:21.915
Apparently her kid
goes to Columbia Grammar

06:21.949 --> 06:23.517
and she's such a
germaphobe

06:23.551 --> 06:26.587
she refuses to use a
public bathroom.

06:26.620 --> 06:29.623
- I hope we're not
downwind of her.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.560
- Brooke, hi! I've
been thinking about you

06:32.593 --> 06:34.462
since I saw you from
across the room.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.463
How are you doing?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.565
I had breakfast
with the Mayor this morning.

06:37.598 --> 06:38.966
We're in talks to rename
the onramp

06:38.999 --> 06:42.570
to the Midtown Tunnel
Alexander von Weber Way.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.538
So, never better!

06:44.572 --> 06:45.706
-You've never looked
better.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.475
Your earrings
are criminally insane.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.977
- 25th wedding
anniversary gift from Lex.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.581
We celebrated all the big events
he may miss before he left.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.750
- Oh my god,
what are you doing here?

06:56.784 --> 06:59.019
- Annabelle! What
are you doing here?

06:59.052 --> 07:00.921
- The boys love
the sleep over.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.990
I mean I didn't think we were
gonna make it at first.

07:03.023 --> 07:06.960
But I'm so glad we did.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.898
- Yeah, cool, cool, cool.
Well, you

07:10.931 --> 07:15.636
know me, I've just been rockin'
and rollin'... whatnot..

07:15.669 --> 07:18.939
- Hi, I'm Jill Weber
and this is my friend, Vanessa.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.541
- Annabelle. Annabelle
Hughes.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.575
Hughes?

07:21.609 --> 07:26.514
Yeah I went back to my
maiden name.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.549
Nice meeting
you.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.751
Bye, Simone.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.693
- Congratulations, you
made it to the beaver dam!

07:39.727 --> 07:45.533
Your next clue will
take you to a time before man.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.000
- Pretty sure they
said "No Phones."

07:47.034 --> 07:49.570
- Dad! Ava's diabetic. She
has a

07:49.603 --> 07:52.105
phone in case of
emergencies.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.907
- You're so lucky
you have diabetes.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.643
- Hazel, don't say that.
Diabetes is

07:55.676 --> 07:57.911
a devastating disease that kills
people.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.947
- Oh my God!

07:59.980 --> 08:03.717
- Sometimes! Okay,
Hall of Dinosaurs

08:03.751 --> 08:05.719
is next, let's go!

08:05.753 --> 08:08.488
- Guys, I'm so
sorry.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.975
- Has anyone ever actually
died of boredom?

08:28.008 --> 08:31.845
Clinically speaking, no.
We may be the first.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.013
Checkmate.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.884
- You're X's. Also, this
isn't chess.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.885
Are you okay?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.753
- Never better!

08:39.787 --> 08:41.555
- Lights out in
fifteen minutes.

08:41.589 --> 08:46.827
Which means it's last call
for early exits! Last call!

08:46.860 --> 08:49.730
- Andy would KILL ME if I
left.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.064
And I would kill you.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.933
- Oh, come on, it's just
one night.

08:52.966 --> 08:57.137
Doors closing in
10...9...

08:57.170 --> 08:59.072
XOXO

08:59.106 --> 09:04.144
- No, it's not just one
night. It's 9 every night?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.679
Jill, can I borrow your
car?

09:05.713 --> 09:07.981
- Sure, but where are you--?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.082
Florida. Watch my kids.?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.785
5...4...

09:11.819 --> 09:18.692
3...2...1...

09:29.770 --> 09:34.307
- Andy!! Brooke just bolted
for--

09:34.341 --> 09:39.680
[?] Hi, your mom
is fine.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.814
You're not going to
believe this.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.350
She borrowed our car and
hijacked some adult diapers.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.318
She's going to piss
herself through 16 states

09:45.352 --> 09:47.054
trying to get
to Cape Canaveral.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.156
Just like that Lady
Astronaut!

09:49.189 --> 09:50.691
- Wasn't she driving
there to kill her husband

09:50.724 --> 09:52.359
for cheating on her
with another astronaut?

09:52.392 --> 09:55.362
- Whatever, it's romantic!

09:55.395 --> 09:57.297
-Babe, wanna go laugh at
the conical boobs

09:57.330 --> 10:00.033
on the early Pacific
humanoids?

10:00.067 --> 10:02.670
- Not this trip, but next
time, okay?

10:02.703 --> 10:05.072
- Forget it.

10:05.105 --> 10:11.144
Jill. Okay, back to the--
Hazel?!

10:13.013 --> 10:14.648
Hazel?

10:14.682 --> 10:17.384
[animals shrieking]

10:21.755 --> 10:23.691
Welcome to the
Hall of Moms

10:23.724 --> 10:25.993
where we have every
species known to man

10:26.026 --> 10:31.765
from the Suburbosaurus Anorex to
the Botoxified VOmitocious.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.802
We are way too sober
for this.

10:34.835 --> 10:38.438
Oh look, that weekend dadisour
is about to go extinct.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.108
Poor thing doesn't stand a
chance against those cougars.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.144
You should go rescue him before
he winds up like that gazelle.

10:44.177 --> 10:49.416
You're well aware of my strict
"no dads" policy.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.051
Ah! Was that a flask!

10:51.084 --> 10:53.120
Oh, I'm on it.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.690
- Jill will you be a dear and
watch my kids for me?

10:56.724 --> 10:59.292
- Sure, do your thing.

11:06.433 --> 11:10.103
Is that a face bra?

11:13.173 --> 11:15.242
- Wait, you don't mean
all night.

11:15.275 --> 11:20.213
'Cause Brooke's
kids here.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.417
- She's sawing
logs like Paul Bunyon.

11:24.451 --> 11:27.254
She's right in Ben
Franklin's G- spot.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.388
- 'Scuse me?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.157
You know that
precise place under a

11:30.190 --> 11:31.291
dome where if you
whisper

11:31.324 --> 11:33.894
it echoes throughout
the whole hall?

11:33.927 --> 11:36.463
- UGH. Of course I got the
worst cots.

11:36.496 --> 11:39.366
Oh there are way worse; if
you're on the perimeter

11:39.399 --> 11:41.769
you can count
on an encounter with a rat.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.304
- (horrified)
Great, thanks.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.406
- Jill, this is Dean.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.109
Thanks for sharing your
space with us.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.211
This dead beat
is Tucker.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.512
- Welcome! Sorry it's
crowded.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.915
I suddenly have eleven
children.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.284
His mom packed the bag
and forgot pj's.

11:57.317 --> 12:01.154
And almost everything
else Luckily she remembered

12:01.188 --> 12:03.390
this or I'd be in
big trouble.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.424
- I don't suppose you
want to share

12:04.457 --> 12:07.460
that with a couple
of ladies who just saved you

12:07.494 --> 12:10.397
from being eaten alive by a
pride of single moms.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.233
- Uh, sure I guess.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.802
- Cough syrup?

12:14.835 --> 12:15.836
- With codeine.

12:15.869 --> 12:16.804
It's the only thing that lets
him sleep through

12:16.837 --> 12:20.941
that cough but I
could get us some alcohol.

12:20.974 --> 12:21.574
- Really?

12:21.608 --> 12:23.143
- You want to help me try?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.511
- Jill, can you watch
his kid?

12:24.544 --> 12:27.380
- Sure. If you see Andy just
tell him the Old Woman

12:27.414 --> 12:30.851
in the Shoe is
looking for him.

12:34.154 --> 12:37.124
[rock music]

12:43.196 --> 12:48.969
- I smell computers,
right here.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.472
- What are you doing?
It's locked.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.342
Oh come on.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.449
- Wow, nice hands.
You a felon?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.384
- Ha! Latch key kid.
Probably

13:04.417 --> 13:07.988
could've turned
pro though actually.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.357
-So, are you
like a computer whiz?

13:10.390 --> 13:14.161
- I'm actually a hacker.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.296
- You just hit "control
alt delete."

13:16.329 --> 13:17.931
- You a hacker too?

13:17.965 --> 13:21.001
- I run the IT department
for an investment firm.

13:21.034 --> 13:25.873
Okay, Amazon Prime Now is
at our finger tips.

13:25.906 --> 13:30.944
A couple bottles of white,
couple bottles of red. Popcorn?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.880
- Ooooh, Sriracha.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.982
- How do we
get a delivery in?

13:35.015 --> 13:38.451
- Deliver to Fire Escape
on Southeast

13:38.485 --> 13:42.289
side of museum. That window's
gotta open, right?

13:42.322 --> 13:45.993
- Genius. Okay, click
purchase. Done!

13:46.026 --> 13:49.296
Delivery within an hour!?

13:53.566 --> 13:58.305
- I'll get supplies and
meet you at the emergency exit.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.440
- Okay.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.948
- So, how do you know
Annabelle?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.516
- We were... summer
friends.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.018
We did everything
together.

14:11.051 --> 14:16.523
Spinning, hot spinning,
yoga, yoga-spinning.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.391
It was the best
summer of my life.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.659
- Reminds me of
that article,

14:19.692 --> 14:20.827
did you read it?

14:20.860 --> 14:21.995
It's about all these Hamptons
women who spend the summer

14:22.029 --> 14:26.233
working out together and
then fully start having affairs?

14:26.266 --> 14:26.967
They called it -

14:27.000 --> 14:31.604
"Lesbians Until
Labor Day"

14:34.174 --> 14:36.009
- It just sort of happened
and by the time

14:36.043 --> 14:37.978
summer ended we vowed to
leave our husbands.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.180
Only I chicken'd out.

14:40.213 --> 14:41.949
- Do you love her?

14:41.982 --> 14:44.918
She obvissimmi loves you,
she left her husband for you.

14:44.952 --> 14:48.021
- I think about her every
time I mount that saddle...

14:48.055 --> 14:51.925
- Okay, normally, I'd
neck punch who said this

14:51.959 --> 14:54.127
but, you need to tell her
how you feel.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.628
Okay.

14:55.662 --> 14:56.363
Watch my ki--?

14:56.396 --> 14:59.332
- Kids, yeah,
yeah. Go,go, go.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.973
- Please drop delivery bag
in sheet hammock,

15:06.006 --> 15:08.942
then tug. Thanks, Dean.

15:08.976 --> 15:09.943
Good, right?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.645
- Yeah. And here:

15:13.213 --> 15:16.149
Nice touch.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.251
Is it on?

15:23.991 --> 15:25.025
It's stuck.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.094
Oh shucks.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.030
Here.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.200
Woah, woah, careful,
careful.

15:40.140 --> 15:44.177
Anabelle.

15:44.211 --> 15:47.014
I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.716
And for last
summer.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.152
I appreciate your
apology.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.488
- Seeing you tonight, I --
I really miss you.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.357
I really miss you, too.

15:57.390 --> 16:02.362
- It's almost summer.
Let's spin it together.

16:02.395 --> 16:06.766
- What happens in
September?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.269
- I'm not going to be your
dirty little secret, Simone.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.438
- You know I love you!
I'd leave Sebastian if I could--

16:11.471 --> 16:14.307
- My books on tape have
taught me that love

16:14.341 --> 16:17.410
is a verb and actions
speak louder than words.

16:17.444 --> 16:21.214
Right now I see you
loud and clear.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.128
- Sir? Hi. I know we got
off on the wrong foot,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.030
but I need some
assistance.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.299
- The smuggler needs help?
Typical.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.102
- My daughter, Hazel,
is lost.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.036
- Where'd you last
see her?

16:43.070 --> 16:45.405
- About an hour ago,
near the Planetarium.?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.378
Go back.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.346
That's her, right there,
that's her!

16:53.380 --> 16:54.481
- She's in the
East African Hall.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.416
Thank god.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.384
- What'd you think
The T-Rex

16:57.417 --> 17:01.254
reanimated and gobbled
her up?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.255
- Well, she's only eleven.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.557
Then you'd better run in there
and rescue her!

17:04.591 --> 17:09.229
- I'm just gonna go make
sure she's okay.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.331
- Fun police.

17:11.364 --> 17:15.102
- The grossest thing was
probably a teratoma.

17:15.135 --> 17:19.806
It's a benign tumor, but this
one had grown teeth and hair.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.508
The beginnings of
an eyeball--

17:21.541 --> 17:24.311
The beginnings of an
eyeball?!

17:24.344 --> 17:27.080
- Holy crap! It's here!

17:27.114 --> 17:27.914
- I've never been
more excited

17:27.947 --> 17:30.817
to drink screw top
wine in my life.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.286
- Thank you!

17:41.661 --> 17:45.398
- Jeez, how many condoms
are in here?!

17:45.432 --> 17:49.236
- I didn't order those! I
mean, I did, but not for us.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.372
Not that I don't want to,
you're a knockout

17:52.405 --> 17:53.640
and a good tipper...

17:53.673 --> 17:56.543
They must have already
been in my cart.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.514
- Crap..

18:01.548 --> 18:03.583
- Oh, I thought that was
pretty good.

18:03.616 --> 18:06.819
- It was, I just don't
date Dads.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.255
- Why?

18:08.288 --> 18:12.125
- Step kids, ex-wives,
it's not for me.

18:12.159 --> 18:15.262
If you're still single when
Tucker turns 18, gimme a call.

18:15.295 --> 18:19.166
- So, there might be a
loophole if my son was older?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.268
- Yeah, I'm not
anti-breeder --

18:21.301 --> 18:29.642
- My son is 26. Tucker's
my grandson.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.444
- But you're so hot!

18:31.478 --> 18:34.414
- Any rule about dating a,
y'know...?

18:34.447 --> 18:38.318
- Nothing in the rule
book about grandpas. ?

18:44.691 --> 18:47.160
- Which kid is the
diabetic?

18:47.194 --> 18:50.563
- Oh, um-- Why do you
want to know?

18:52.299 --> 18:54.467
- What are you doing?!

19:04.344 --> 19:06.713
- It's too low, it's too low,
you have to come over here.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.216
Right in under
Ben Franklin's g-spot.

19:09.249 --> 19:13.253
You got to John Cusack it
and jack it to eleven!

19:25.732 --> 19:29.336
- Our interval training song
from yoga-spin!

19:44.417 --> 19:46.619
- We have one hour before
they turn the lights on.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.421
- What are you talking
about?

19:48.455 --> 19:50.623
- I've been chasing the
wrong girl all night.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.791
You're coming
with me.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.528
- You gonna throw me over
your shoulder like a caveman??

19:55.562 --> 19:58.331
- What!

19:59.666 --> 20:02.369
Could you watch my
twenty-seven kids?

20:02.402 --> 20:04.737
Thanks.

20:24.357 --> 20:27.394
[intense music]

20:37.504 --> 20:39.672
- Noooooooooooooo!!!!! ?

20:55.688 --> 20:58.991
- I got off the rocket.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.059
- Lex?

21:00.092 --> 21:03.830
- Without you Mars just seemed
like an inhabitable,

21:03.863 --> 21:08.000
wasteland with acid rain
and shitty wifi.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.738
I can just go to Newark
for that. I love you.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.683
Are you wearing
a diaper?
