00:13.741 --> 00:16.140
Let's just go to that next
tree and then we'll stop.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.420
Got a great tree right here.

00:18.857 --> 00:20.417
Come on, Dan!

00:33.056 --> 00:35.575
Throw another limp on the barbie.

00:35.576 --> 00:37.215
How many more have you got left?

00:37.216 --> 00:39.335
Have I done 'The Limportance
of Being Earnest'?

00:39.335 --> 00:40.500
Yes.

00:40.517 --> 00:46.636
Then I have 'Deep Limpact', 'Homer
Limpson' and 'New Zealand Aladdin'.

00:46.637 --> 00:48.156
Why?

00:48.157 --> 00:49.997
Because you've got a magic limp.

00:51.696 --> 00:54.335
- I said, because you...
- Yeah, got it.

00:54.336 --> 00:56.779
- You've got a magic limp.
- I heard it, I heard it.

00:56.804 --> 00:58.815
Oh, if you don't want babies,

00:58.816 --> 01:00.372
Grace is the one who's
supposed to take the pill.

01:00.397 --> 01:01.877
They're vitamins.

01:03.006 --> 01:05.606
Hey can I, um, see you
in my office for a second?

01:06.646 --> 01:08.126
Okay.

01:12.406 --> 01:15.049
Did you find the pet rat I
keep in the food cupboard?

01:15.074 --> 01:16.445
- The what?
- I'm joking.

01:16.446 --> 01:18.969
But I figure whatever I'm in
trouble for will seem less bad now.

01:19.008 --> 01:21.487
- You're not in trouble.
- Yes!

01:21.488 --> 01:23.567
I've opened some of Mum's mail.

01:23.568 --> 01:25.767
I think she's paying
for a lot of the bills

01:25.768 --> 01:27.352
out of her retirement savings.

01:27.377 --> 01:28.534
Oh.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.967
- That's bad?
- Yes.

01:30.968 --> 01:34.927
- Worse than opening someone's mail?
- Well, we're making a loss, Em.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.487
Ohh.

01:36.488 --> 01:38.575
We're going to have to make some cuts.

01:38.664 --> 01:40.122
Like what?

01:44.208 --> 01:45.927
No!

01:45.928 --> 01:48.167
You're going to fire
your own grandmother?

01:48.168 --> 01:50.128
Shh! She's not my grandmother.

01:51.568 --> 01:53.287
But, yes, that's the plan.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.224
Barbara will murder you,
and not in your sleep.

02:30.256 --> 02:32.375
- She'd wake you up to do it.
- I don't want to.

02:32.376 --> 02:35.268
We just can't afford to keep her on
anymore. Maybe she wants to retire.

02:35.293 --> 02:37.415
Maybe she's just hanging
around out of loyalty to Mum.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.495
There must be a better
way to save money.

02:40.307 --> 02:41.450
What's this?

02:41.475 --> 02:42.755
- Our electricity bill.
- Great.

02:43.068 --> 02:45.169
Switch to candles. More romantic.

02:45.841 --> 02:46.808
Water.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.800
We'll drink up when it rains and
flushing the toilet is for cowards.

02:49.825 --> 02:51.771
- Yeah, Em...
- Work with me here.

02:51.857 --> 02:53.254
You don't want to fire your godmother.

02:53.279 --> 02:55.092
She's not my godmother,
okay? Or my grandmother.

02:55.117 --> 02:56.935
She's an employee.

02:57.881 --> 02:58.818
Is that how it is?

02:58.843 --> 03:00.882
Look, I've got a meeting
with the accountant at one.

03:00.907 --> 03:03.346
If they can find any other way
to save money, I'm all ears.

03:03.388 --> 03:05.467
Great. And you and I can
brainstorm over lunch.

03:05.468 --> 03:08.667
Well, I was actually going
to catch up with Grace.

03:08.668 --> 03:10.507
You went for a run
with her this morning.

03:10.508 --> 03:13.547
I know. I mean, you
can come if you want.

03:13.548 --> 03:15.248
I want you guys to be friends,
and Grace really likes you.

03:15.273 --> 03:17.043
I like her, but you're
the one dating her.

03:17.068 --> 03:18.547
It's more important that you like her.

03:18.548 --> 03:20.987
- I do. I want you to like her.
- I said I like her.

03:20.988 --> 03:22.827
- Yeah, and she likes you.
- She likes you.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.587
- She does?
- She should. I like you.

03:24.588 --> 03:26.867
Yeah, and I like... Are
you coming to lunch or not?

03:27.251 --> 03:29.810
Why didn't you tell me it was
going to be a romantic picnic?

03:29.811 --> 03:33.663
Because it's not. It's just
lunch, outside on a blanket.

03:33.688 --> 03:35.967
Oh, yeah, well, that sounds
perfectly reasonable then.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.551
Did you only bring two glasses?

03:38.576 --> 03:41.575
Yes. Sorry, that's fine.
Uh, Grace and I can share.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.080
After all, we've kissed on the mouth.

03:46.762 --> 03:48.952
I just think you probably
want to do that more.

03:48.977 --> 03:50.013
Today. Alone.

03:50.038 --> 03:51.430
No, no, we'll share a glass.

03:51.455 --> 03:53.734
Then you can't do the romantic
arm twisty drink thing.

03:53.884 --> 03:56.283
- It's just a casual lunch.
- Is it? What'd you pack for food?

03:56.284 --> 03:58.563
A piece of spaghetti and a meatball
you can push around with your noses?

03:58.580 --> 04:00.219
Salad, actually. Casual salad.

04:00.822 --> 04:03.087
Oh, yeah, this is practically
a business meeting.

04:03.111 --> 04:04.267
- Hi!
- Hi.

04:04.283 --> 04:05.882
Hey, how are you?

04:06.353 --> 04:07.792
Emma, have these.

04:07.817 --> 04:09.118
- Me?
- Yep.

04:09.126 --> 04:11.165
Patients bring them
in, but I get hay fever,

04:11.166 --> 04:12.925
so I was going to give them to Daniel.

04:12.926 --> 04:14.405
Now I'm giving them to you.

04:14.406 --> 04:16.365
Maybe they'll look nice in
the office or your bedroom.

04:16.366 --> 04:19.285
That is so nice. I'm going
to take them there right now.

04:19.286 --> 04:21.084
- No, they'll last for hours.
- No, sit down.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.565
That was really nice.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.205
This was a great idea, Dan.

04:24.206 --> 04:26.165
- Thank you.
- How are your legs feeling?

04:26.166 --> 04:28.085
Uh, yeah, good, thanks. Not even sore.

04:28.086 --> 04:29.805
Really? We'll have to
go harder tomorrow then.

04:29.806 --> 04:31.285
Uh, well, that... they are...

04:31.286 --> 04:33.405
They're the exact amount
of sore they need to be

04:33.406 --> 04:35.326
to not go harder tomorrow.

04:37.248 --> 04:39.114
Emma, you should join
us on one of our runs.

04:39.139 --> 04:40.240
Oh, I don't run.

04:40.248 --> 04:41.847
Unless I'm in mortal
danger, and even then,

04:41.848 --> 04:43.327
if it was going to be a quick death,

04:43.328 --> 04:45.807
I'd seriously consider it over running.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.833
That's not a joke. I'd
rather die than run.

04:49.513 --> 04:51.200
So what do you do for exercise?

04:51.225 --> 04:53.105
Sometimes I dream I'm flying.

04:54.622 --> 04:56.621
Uh, Grace, do you mind
if we share a glass?

04:56.622 --> 04:58.421
- I only brought two.
- Of course not.

04:58.422 --> 05:00.661
We exchange 80 million
microbes each time we kiss,

05:00.662 --> 05:02.301
so sharing a glass is fine.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.949
Well, here are some more microbes.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.141
Well!

05:12.142 --> 05:14.341
Em, seriously, stay.
There's heaps of food.

05:14.342 --> 05:16.741
It's fine. I just think you
guys probably want to kiss a lot.

05:16.742 --> 05:18.381
And you should because love is great.

05:18.573 --> 05:20.033
Or liking each other a lot.

05:20.039 --> 05:23.278
Wherever you're at. This is beautiful.

05:23.607 --> 05:26.526
This... You guys, this
whole thing, warms my heart.

05:26.613 --> 05:28.582
Have a lovely outside blanket lunch.

05:28.607 --> 05:30.453
I'll meet you at the accountants,
Dan. Grace, I'll see you later.

05:30.470 --> 05:32.829
- At least take something with you.
- What?

05:32.861 --> 05:36.109
Um, I could put some wine
in a Tupperware container?

05:36.134 --> 05:37.375
Okay, bye.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.973
How's the lamington?

05:50.162 --> 05:52.722
Oh, I can't. Eating plan.

05:59.842 --> 06:02.121
- Danny McCallum!
- Daniel.

06:02.122 --> 06:03.681
Uh, hi, Steph.

06:03.682 --> 06:05.628
I didn't expect to see
you still in Rosehaven.

06:05.653 --> 06:08.692
Of course! Rosehaven's the
best. You living here now?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.441
Thought you'd left us for the mainland.

06:10.442 --> 06:12.628
Uh, yes, I came back
to run my Mum's agency.

06:12.653 --> 06:13.830
Couldn't hack it?

06:15.722 --> 06:17.881
Hi, I'm Stephanie.

06:18.639 --> 06:21.130
- Emma.
- Are you two...?

06:21.154 --> 06:23.273
Oh, just friends.

06:23.274 --> 06:25.473
But he tries it on, constantly.

06:25.474 --> 06:28.233
- He got you flowers?
- His girlfriend did.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.993
Weird.

06:29.994 --> 06:32.323
How long has it been, Danny? 10 years?

06:32.348 --> 06:34.002
Uh, yeah, probably.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.338
Um...

06:35.347 --> 06:37.746
Do you still like...

06:38.088 --> 06:39.104
drawing?

06:39.129 --> 06:39.877
What?

06:39.886 --> 06:43.671
Oh, I just remember you used to draw
with, uh, chalk on your driveway.

06:43.696 --> 06:46.524
No, I don't draw with chalk
anymore. Do you still read comics?

06:47.110 --> 06:48.005
Yes.

06:49.285 --> 06:51.484
So, I'm assuming you're here

06:51.485 --> 06:54.924
because McCallum Real Estate is...

06:54.925 --> 06:57.084
- What's... what's that?
- In the toilet, financially.

06:57.085 --> 06:58.804
Yeah, Stephanie, what happened?

06:58.805 --> 07:01.686
Mum's been running it
just fine for 30 years.

07:01.976 --> 07:03.850
Did the market change or something?

07:03.875 --> 07:05.796
No, your Mum did.

07:05.819 --> 07:07.898
I've been trying to get
her to sell for months.

07:07.899 --> 07:11.658
Instead she let you take
over. And that was smart.

07:11.659 --> 07:14.018
Yeah, well, we're not selling,
okay? I want to know how to fix it.

07:14.019 --> 07:16.578
Sure, you could...
you could sell a house.

07:17.256 --> 07:18.841
I'm working on that.

07:18.865 --> 07:19.938
In the meantime,

07:19.963 --> 07:21.735
you need to save some money.

07:22.429 --> 07:24.469
Uh, well, I have actually
already thought...

07:24.494 --> 07:26.836
Oh, no, no, he hasn't.
What do you suggest?

07:30.305 --> 07:31.905
This.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.705
Easiest thing to get rid of.

07:35.865 --> 07:37.243
No way.

07:37.545 --> 07:39.184
No.

07:39.185 --> 07:41.532
No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

07:41.557 --> 07:44.177
It's fine. They're young.
They'll get over it.

07:44.545 --> 07:46.864
Em, McCallum Real Estate has
sponsored the Rosehaven Ravens

07:46.865 --> 07:48.025
since I was a kid.

07:48.026 --> 07:50.464
Okay, our town is the reason
Tasmania has a league now.

07:50.465 --> 07:52.104
We were the first.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.504
Yeah, but you don't appreciate
anything when you're young.

07:54.505 --> 07:55.269
You'll see.

07:55.285 --> 07:58.140
It'll be a bunch of depressed
teens checking their phones,

07:58.142 --> 08:00.687
wishing their parents didn't
force them to go outside.

08:05.266 --> 08:06.905
They're hating this.

08:06.906 --> 08:09.625
Sarah! That looks like a blade!

08:09.626 --> 08:11.385
Do you want to warp the disc?

08:11.386 --> 08:13.185
Bruce must be taking over from Greg.

08:13.186 --> 08:16.065
That's good. You can stick
it to your old school bully.

08:16.755 --> 08:18.653
That used to be me out there.

08:20.915 --> 08:22.059
Okay, guys!

08:23.841 --> 08:25.493
Can I get your attention, please?

08:33.078 --> 08:36.558
- So this is Barbara's son, Danny.
- It's Daniel.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.357
He's kidding. He loves
being called Danny.

08:38.383 --> 08:42.039
Now, his Mum is the reason
you guys are able to practice.

08:42.399 --> 08:46.649
So can we give him a big
Rosehaven Raven shout out!

08:51.046 --> 08:52.525
Perfect.

08:52.526 --> 08:54.365
We heard you were popping over.

08:54.366 --> 08:56.926
I had the kids put together
something for your Mum. Timothy!

09:02.080 --> 09:03.697
Thanks, Timothy.

09:05.033 --> 09:08.152
Okay, guys, take five while
we have a little bit of a chat.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.164
Not you, Sarah!

09:17.102 --> 09:18.902
Surprised to see you pop by.

09:20.262 --> 09:24.821
I have to say, uh, this is a great
thing you're doing for these kids,

09:24.822 --> 09:26.422
so...

09:29.422 --> 09:30.982
thanks.

09:33.622 --> 09:39.622
Bruce, McCallum Real Estate will no
longer sponsor the Rosehaven Ravens.

09:43.022 --> 09:44.817
Take back the card, Timothy!

09:53.342 --> 09:55.141
- You did the right thing.
- Really?

09:55.142 --> 09:57.366
Because I thought I
just made 20 kids cry.

09:57.391 --> 09:58.703
They were faking.

09:58.735 --> 10:00.214
They're kids, Em.

10:00.215 --> 10:02.429
Might as well have given the
cup to the Rosstown Ravens.

10:02.453 --> 10:05.292
Hang on, is there a Rosstown Ravens
as well as a Rosehaven Ravens?

10:05.293 --> 10:07.738
Yeah, they copied us. Now
they'll be the only ones.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.941
Why don't I shout us dinner
tonight? You, me, parmas, beer.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.054
I'm actually... having
dinner with... Grace tonight.

10:26.283 --> 10:28.251
When are we going to hang out?

10:28.283 --> 10:31.548
- We hang out every day at work.
- That's not hanging out, that's work.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.946
I know, I'm sorry.

10:34.048 --> 10:35.954
It's just started with Grace
and I so it's actually...

10:35.986 --> 10:37.705
I get it. It's new, it's fun.

10:37.706 --> 10:39.183
We're all very excited,

10:39.191 --> 10:41.430
but you are allowed to hang out
with other people occasionally,

10:41.431 --> 10:44.430
for example your best friend, who
is now going through a divorce.

10:44.431 --> 10:48.190
Yes, you're right. Um, why don't
we book in some time together?

10:48.573 --> 10:49.542
What?

10:49.582 --> 10:51.501
Well... well, you sync the
calendars for the office,

10:51.502 --> 10:53.381
so why don't you book in
some time for us to hang out,

10:53.382 --> 10:56.661
then I know not to organise
stuff with Grace at the same time.

10:56.662 --> 10:58.602
- Book in time? You serious?
- Well, it's just a thought.

10:58.627 --> 11:00.454
Okay, I'll make an appointment
with your secretary,

11:00.470 --> 11:01.949
if you don't fire her first.

11:01.950 --> 11:04.641
- I just did that so I don't have to.
- Don't have to what?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.909
Nothing.

11:09.620 --> 11:11.313
Anything you want to tell me?

11:12.430 --> 11:14.990
Yesterday I made a
cup of soup in a bowl.

11:16.430 --> 11:19.664
I hear you're the owner of the
business now. Congratulations.

11:19.890 --> 11:21.734
I got a phone call from Bruce.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.964
Sounds like you're making
sponsorship decisions

11:24.965 --> 11:26.313
which only the owner can
make, so you must be the owner.

11:26.337 --> 11:27.417
Mum, I can explain.

11:27.418 --> 11:30.053
Good, 'cause I'm a bit
confused when you took over.

11:30.078 --> 11:33.416
Did I die? I hope not.
I just made a casserole.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.416
I've just been trying to look
at some ways we can cut back.

11:35.417 --> 11:37.137
You probably want to
yell at him in private.

11:39.714 --> 11:40.656
Daniel.

11:40.657 --> 11:42.416
You've been eating into
your retirement savings.

11:42.417 --> 11:43.896
That's for me to worry about.

11:43.897 --> 11:45.536
Well, I'm not going to
let you keep doing that.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.296
So you thought you'd end a relationship

11:47.297 --> 11:50.016
McCallum Real Estate's had with
the community for over 25 years?

11:50.017 --> 11:51.496
We can't afford it anymore, okay?

11:51.497 --> 11:53.776
I didn't want to, but I'm not going
to let you throw your money away

11:53.777 --> 11:55.256
just so some kids can play Frisbee.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.856
That used to be you out there,
and it's not your choice to make.

11:57.857 --> 11:59.456
This is pointless.

12:00.147 --> 12:02.787
Emma, can you please
talk some sense into him?

12:03.671 --> 12:05.870
You know what, Mum,
it is my choice, okay?

12:05.871 --> 12:07.630
I'm not a babysitter, I'm a manager.

12:07.631 --> 12:10.310
Okay? If I make a decision,
you have to back it up.

12:10.311 --> 12:11.910
I didn't move my whole life back here

12:11.911 --> 12:13.358
just so I could be your assistant.

12:13.390 --> 12:15.710
I had a tough choice to make,
I made it, end of discussion.

12:24.509 --> 12:26.070
I got these for you.

12:27.350 --> 12:29.510
I'll just hold them.

12:38.550 --> 12:42.589
Stop taking everything I write so
literally, okay? I'm sick of it.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.189
Look, I don't have time
for this conversation again.

12:45.190 --> 12:46.377
No, you look.

12:46.408 --> 12:49.527
I've brought me own glass
and I want me free beer.

12:49.528 --> 12:51.727
Phil, for the last time, it's a joke.

12:51.728 --> 12:53.767
You still have to pay five dollars.

12:53.768 --> 12:56.207
- What can I get you, Daniel?
- Uh, a pint, please.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.127
If you bring your own glass, it's free.

12:58.128 --> 12:59.608
It's not.

13:03.524 --> 13:04.527
Em.

13:04.528 --> 13:06.807
- Daniel.
- You're... here.

13:06.808 --> 13:09.287
Yeah. Is that okay? Sorry
I don't have an appointment.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.767
It was just a suggestion.

13:10.768 --> 13:13.047
- Thank you.
- Evening, Emma. Drink?

13:13.048 --> 13:14.967
Heaps. Pint first, please.

13:14.968 --> 13:17.127
- If you bring your own...
- Shut up, Phil.

13:17.128 --> 13:19.367
Hey is, uh, is Mum okay?

13:19.368 --> 13:22.167
- She threw a knife at a photo of you.
- Are you serious?

13:22.168 --> 13:24.527
No. But you really left
me hanging in there.

13:24.528 --> 13:26.007
Yeah, sorry.

13:26.008 --> 13:27.768
- There you go.
- Thank you.

13:28.768 --> 13:33.407
Um, I only booked for two but
we can get another chair, or...?

13:33.408 --> 13:34.888
What for?

13:35.968 --> 13:38.247
Oh, I'm not going on
your date, you idiot.

13:38.681 --> 13:40.165
Oh, right.

13:40.585 --> 13:42.144
Um, good luck.

13:42.145 --> 13:43.704
- Why good luck?
- Because it's a date.

13:43.705 --> 13:45.264
- Now I'm nervous.
- That's normal.

13:45.265 --> 13:47.025
- Yeah, but I wasn't nervous before.
- Sorry.

13:50.145 --> 13:51.227
Hey.

13:55.785 --> 13:57.544
Hi. Hey.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.024
Hi.

13:59.579 --> 14:01.203
I got your text.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.750
But you probably know that 'cause
I'm sitting here, and I replied.

14:05.625 --> 14:08.105
- You look great.
- Thank you.

14:09.620 --> 14:12.699
You know, you have quite
nice eyes, both of them.

14:12.700 --> 14:18.060
That's very kind. I enjoy
using them to look at your face.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.499
Oh, no.

14:22.938 --> 14:24.110
What?

14:24.423 --> 14:26.103
We're wearing the same thing.

14:27.220 --> 14:28.602
Nah.

14:28.627 --> 14:31.107
Yeah, blue pants, black top. Goddammit.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.782
Oh, yeah.

14:34.977 --> 14:36.340
That's the best.

14:39.641 --> 14:40.780
Weirdo!

14:42.300 --> 14:43.399
Trendsetters.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.939
So I got a call today from
one of my old lecturers.

14:50.369 --> 14:52.728
She was a pretty big mentor to me at uni

14:52.728 --> 14:54.320
and I would love the
chance to work with her.

14:54.345 --> 14:55.646
Okay.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.849
And there is an opening at her practice

14:57.850 --> 14:59.569
she'd like me to apply for.

15:00.146 --> 15:01.208
In Rosehaven?

15:01.233 --> 15:03.713
- On the Gold Coast.
- Right.

15:06.475 --> 15:07.528
Um...

15:08.706 --> 15:12.324
So what are your plans for when
your Mum's back in the office?

15:14.444 --> 15:16.803
Go back to the... go
back to the mainland.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.403
The Gold Coast is on the mainland.

15:21.565 --> 15:23.137
Yeah. Uh, yeah, it is.

15:23.864 --> 15:26.463
- Danny McCallum.
- Daniel.

15:26.464 --> 15:29.583
- Hi, Olive.
- Do you like watching kids cry?

15:30.035 --> 15:32.067
- No.
- I think you do.

15:32.075 --> 15:33.794
Bruce said you took a
great deal of pleasure

15:33.795 --> 15:35.514
clipping the wings of those kids today.

15:35.515 --> 15:37.354
No, that... that's not
true. I didn't want to.

15:37.355 --> 15:39.514
I mean, Greg, you know I wouldn't
have done it unless I had to.

15:39.515 --> 15:41.834
Yeah, Danny, actually
I just came to say hi,

15:41.835 --> 15:44.234
but Olive told me to stand behind
her and stay quiet, so I thought...

15:44.235 --> 15:45.954
Greg!

15:45.955 --> 15:47.954
I'm sure he thinks he's
doing the right thing.

15:47.955 --> 15:51.274
He said she was just an
employee. Am I just an employee?

15:51.275 --> 15:53.714
I am worried that the rush of
climbing the corporate ladder

15:53.715 --> 15:56.474
of rural Tasmania real estate
is starting to affect him.

15:56.475 --> 15:58.834
You know, that might be
a very real possibility.

15:58.835 --> 16:01.554
He hasn't even got time for me
anymore, and I'm all he's got.

16:01.555 --> 16:03.394
Of all the heartless,

16:03.395 --> 16:06.274
short-sighted, brutal things...

16:06.275 --> 16:08.434
They can keep playing,
we just can't pay for it.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.794
And Doctor Howlett. I'm surprised at
the company you're choosing to keep.

16:11.795 --> 16:13.554
This was a really hard
decision for him, Olive.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.714
- Then why is he out celebrating?
- I'm not out celebrating.

16:15.715 --> 16:18.314
And I'm not sure if
frisbee's a real sport.

16:18.315 --> 16:19.794
Oh!

16:20.539 --> 16:23.241
So much for McCallum Real
Estate being community minded.

16:23.258 --> 16:26.640
My son Timothy hasn't left his
room. He said, "What's the point?"

16:26.726 --> 16:28.645
My daughter was throwing
plates in the kitchen.

16:28.646 --> 16:31.005
Said it reminded her of
being part of something.

16:31.006 --> 16:33.090
- Leave him alone, you guys!
- Thanks, Em.

16:33.098 --> 16:35.698
If you want to speak to Daniel,
you've got to make an appointment.

16:37.999 --> 16:40.159
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

17:26.617 --> 17:29.058
- Mrs Marsh.
- Morning, Emma.

17:38.510 --> 17:39.501
Big night?

17:39.517 --> 17:41.181
I always wear sunglasses in the office.

17:41.205 --> 17:43.444
- Oh, I must have forgotten that.
- What's with all the frisbees?

17:43.445 --> 17:45.964
A present from Bruce. Oh, thanks
for backing me up last night.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.564
- You're welcome.
- No, that was sarcasm.

17:47.565 --> 17:49.204
You didn't back me up.
You made things worse.

17:49.205 --> 17:51.404
Well, in my defence, I can't remember.

17:51.405 --> 17:56.164
Daniel, there's some people outside
who might want to talk to you.

17:56.165 --> 17:59.805
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

18:07.325 --> 18:10.333
There he is! The chicken who
ran out of the pub last night!

18:10.349 --> 18:13.908
I didn't. I walked out, casually,
while you made bird noises at me.

18:13.909 --> 18:15.348
We want our frisbees back!

18:15.349 --> 18:16.948
Yeah!

18:16.949 --> 18:18.948
- Bruce stuffed them in my office.
- Yeah, he made me do it!

18:18.949 --> 18:20.868
Said he couldn't wait to see
the look on the kids' faces

18:20.869 --> 18:22.348
when the frisbees were gone.

18:23.629 --> 18:25.468
That's clearly a lie.
I'm not a Disney villain.

18:25.469 --> 18:28.868
I heard that he's
selling them to Rosstown.

18:28.869 --> 18:31.748
The Rosstown Ravens are
scum. I would never do that.

18:31.749 --> 18:33.268
He works for Rosstown!

18:36.909 --> 18:38.828
Everyone, calm down. That's enough.

18:39.779 --> 18:40.708
Greg?

18:40.709 --> 18:43.308
Oh, yeah, sorry, Danny.
Bruce asked me to carry it.

18:43.309 --> 18:47.469
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!
Ravens! Ravens! Ravens!

18:56.103 --> 18:59.024
If I sneak out the back, are there
any shops nearby that sell tear gas?

18:59.048 --> 19:01.447
Give them back to them. Tell them
I'm reinstating the sponsorship.

19:01.448 --> 19:03.247
It's just frisbee, Daniel.
They'll get over it.

19:03.248 --> 19:05.047
No, that partnership has
meant getting the business

19:05.048 --> 19:07.047
from all those children's
parents whenever they've moved.

19:07.048 --> 19:08.287
I was stupid to cancel it.

19:08.288 --> 19:10.447
So you're only sponsoring them
because of what you get out of it?

19:10.448 --> 19:12.007
Yes, that's how you run a business.

19:12.413 --> 19:14.475
Fine. We'll find another
way to save money.

19:14.491 --> 19:16.770
We already have another way. Look,
we don't need Mrs Marsh anymore.

19:16.771 --> 19:18.250
You've taken on most
of her duties already.

19:18.251 --> 19:19.490
So it's my fault?

19:19.491 --> 19:21.210
No, I told Mum I'm
making the tough choices.

19:21.211 --> 19:23.170
How does it look if I don't
follow through with this one

19:23.171 --> 19:25.090
and give them back
the sponsorship money?

19:25.091 --> 19:27.170
So why don't you fire me as well?
That'll save even more money.

19:27.171 --> 19:29.090
Em, stop taking everything
so personally, okay?

19:29.091 --> 19:30.970
I've got an employee who
doesn't do her work anymore.

19:30.971 --> 19:32.770
I'm letting them go.
It's as simple as that.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.330
Fine. Well, I don't want
to be here when you do it.

19:35.331 --> 19:37.330
Well, you might as well go
home. You're hungover anyway.

19:37.825 --> 19:38.810
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr Perfect.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.890
I must have forgotten to
take my five million vitamins

19:40.891 --> 19:42.490
that I don't even know what they do.

19:42.491 --> 19:44.410
It's magnesium and it's
for muscle recovery.

19:44.411 --> 19:47.050
And if I'm hungover it's because
we're supposed to drink together.

19:47.051 --> 19:49.851
I get the shots, you get the
chasers. You broke the system.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.074
Goodbye, Mrs Marsh.

19:57.099 --> 19:58.488
Not feeling well, Emma?

20:04.728 --> 20:06.922
Go home. Feel better.

20:13.866 --> 20:15.505
Good news, everyone.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.225
McCallum Real Estate will be sponsoring

20:17.226 --> 20:18.865
your stupid frisbee games again!

20:18.866 --> 20:20.149
- Oh!
- Really?

20:20.174 --> 20:21.733
- Danny said that?
- Yep.

20:21.758 --> 20:22.743
And as an extra bonus,

20:22.768 --> 20:25.167
he's going to be firing a nice old
lady who might have gone to war.

20:25.713 --> 20:27.085
Oh, well, we didn't know about that.

20:27.086 --> 20:31.325
No, you didn't. So I hope you
enjoy your precious Frisbees.

20:31.326 --> 20:32.845
Careful! They're expensive!

20:32.846 --> 20:36.605
Oh, it's like all anyone cares
about is frisbees and money!

20:36.606 --> 20:38.205
And frisbee money!

20:38.206 --> 20:40.366
It's all business!

20:42.686 --> 20:45.205
Frisbee is the heart of this town!

20:46.152 --> 20:47.354
Oi, you've got a pretty good arm!

20:47.378 --> 20:49.017
You should come to practice.

20:49.042 --> 20:50.313
She's gone. She didn't hear me.

21:21.219 --> 21:25.138
Um, Mrs Marsh, can I
talk to you, please?

21:25.139 --> 21:26.898
Certainly, Danny.

21:26.899 --> 21:29.018
Did you want a hot chocolate?

21:29.019 --> 21:31.898
Uh, yes. Sorry, no. No, thank you.

21:31.899 --> 21:35.618
Um, Mrs Marsh, you're
here full-time, aren't you?

21:35.619 --> 21:39.138
Open till close, six days a week.

21:39.139 --> 21:41.419
And you're busy?

21:43.499 --> 21:48.079
Right. Um, Mrs Marsh, I've
been... I've been thinking, uh...

21:50.459 --> 21:56.498
I remember when I taught you piano,
you would always do this. Hesitate.

21:56.499 --> 21:59.618
You need to be more confident, Danny.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.858
I actually prefer Daniel now.

22:02.543 --> 22:04.338
That's a good start.

22:04.339 --> 22:05.923
Right.

22:05.931 --> 22:09.370
Mrs Marsh, do you ever
get, um, bored working here?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.130
I like it.

22:11.131 --> 22:15.410
You wouldn't rather be at
home, um, reading, or...?

22:15.411 --> 22:18.050
I get to do a lot here.

22:18.770 --> 22:19.850
Uh, right.

22:19.851 --> 22:22.930
Well, if you ever did want to leave,
you would have my full support.

22:22.931 --> 22:24.690
Not financially, obviously.

22:24.691 --> 22:27.895
Daniel, what are you trying to say?

22:30.051 --> 22:33.331
Mrs Marsh, I have to let you go.

22:36.163 --> 22:37.491
Oh.

22:37.718 --> 22:39.011
I'm so sorry.

22:39.414 --> 22:43.030
"Let go" means "fire", right?

22:43.091 --> 22:44.512
Danny...

22:45.738 --> 22:48.090
I don't get paid.

22:48.091 --> 22:49.570
I'm sorry?

22:49.571 --> 22:52.250
I don't get paid.

22:52.251 --> 22:57.211
I just come in, or I'd be knocking
about the house, otherwise.

22:58.411 --> 23:01.170
But I can leave if you want, Daniel.

23:02.268 --> 23:04.610
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

23:04.611 --> 23:08.410
No, please, uh, stay
forever. I'm so sorry.

23:08.411 --> 23:10.410
Thank you for...

23:11.241 --> 23:13.531
Okay. Uh, thank you.

23:43.651 --> 23:46.731
There's the man that's not
afraid to make the tough calls.

23:49.411 --> 23:52.426
Mum, I reinstated the sponsorship.

23:53.170 --> 23:54.211
I know.

23:55.787 --> 23:56.772
All right.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.210
Daniel, I'm not an idiot.

24:00.211 --> 24:02.010
I know we're in the red right now,

24:02.011 --> 24:05.210
and it's my choice what I
do with my retirement money.

24:05.211 --> 24:08.090
- Maybe we should listen to Steph.
- I don't care what Steph says.

24:08.091 --> 24:10.290
I know I can turn it
around once I'm back.

24:10.291 --> 24:14.370
Meantime, I'd appreciate it if you
didn't try and fire your godmother.

24:14.371 --> 24:17.450
- Oh, she is my godmother.
- You overstepped your bounds today.

24:17.451 --> 24:20.050
I'll be back soon and you
won't have to worry about it,

24:20.051 --> 24:21.882
so stop second guessing me.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.010
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:00.011 --> 25:01.571
- Come in.
- Thanks.

25:04.289 --> 25:06.148
Sorry if the place is a mess.

25:06.593 --> 25:08.971
Yeah, it's pretty
disgusting in here, Grace.

25:12.066 --> 25:13.050
You okay?

25:13.051 --> 25:14.690
- Did you take too much magnesium?
- No.

25:14.691 --> 25:15.891
- Any vomiting?
- No.

25:15.892 --> 25:17.130
- Nausea?
- No, no.

25:17.131 --> 25:18.690
- Sleepiness?
- Yes but no.

25:18.691 --> 25:20.371
Uh, no, I wanted...

25:21.651 --> 25:23.850
You know how you
mentioned the Gold Coast.

25:23.851 --> 25:27.490
Yeah. But I know you have
responsibilities here.

25:27.491 --> 25:31.010
No, I think Mum's actually looking
forward to getting rid of me.

25:31.011 --> 25:33.410
- What about Emma?
- Oh, she's an adult.

25:33.411 --> 25:35.491
I mean, she'll be fine.

25:37.757 --> 25:40.170
I... I want to go with you.

25:40.171 --> 25:43.051
To the... to the Gold Coast?

25:45.035 --> 25:46.195
Anywhere.

25:50.047 --> 25:51.971
But, yes, the Gold Coast.

25:58.971 --> 26:01.088
I'm going to move with
Grace to the Gold Coast.

26:01.113 --> 26:02.064
What?

26:02.103 --> 26:05.010
You did a final inspection
this morning. How did it look?

26:05.011 --> 26:06.211
Good.

26:06.212 --> 26:07.730
We're going to have to clean the house.

26:07.731 --> 26:09.410
With what? Our hands?

26:09.411 --> 26:11.010
Are we... cool?

26:11.011 --> 26:12.032
Yeah, we're cool.

26:12.057 --> 26:14.016
- Oh, Em, grow up!
- All I've done is help you!

26:14.040 --> 26:16.039
By showing up at my
doorstep and sponging off me?

26:16.587 --> 26:17.711
Come on, Damien.

26:23.707 --> 26:27.378
True or false? An octopus has a beak?

26:30.308 --> 26:31.506
False.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.832
Incorrect. Drink!

26:37.467 --> 26:40.147
On what continent
would you not find bees?

26:41.674 --> 26:43.744
- Antarctica.
- Correct. Drink!
