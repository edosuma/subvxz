WEBVTT

00:53.012 --> 00:54.597
<i>Billie-bear.</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:56.140
<i>Why is it so dark?</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:59.685
<i>Are you still in bed?</i>
<i>It's almost 10.</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:03.063
<i>Could this mean</i>
<i>she's actually relaxing?</i>

01:03.147 --> 01:05.232
No, I can't sleep here.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.818
Night’s should not be
this dark. It's unnatural.

01:07.902 --> 01:09.528
<i>What happened to</i>
<i>my horror movie fan?</i>

01:09.612 --> 01:10.780
<i>I thought you'd</i>
<i>miss getting scared.</i>

01:10.863 --> 01:13.032
I miss flushing my pee.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.284
<i>Well, if you prefer a Bible</i>
<i>camp, we can make some calls.</i>

01:15.367 --> 01:17.077
You guys said it
would be B-B-Q’s and beaches

01:17.161 --> 01:19.413
but Justin's weird
ex step family is here.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.457
<i>Don't let internalized</i>
<i>feelings of abandonment</i>

01:21.540 --> 01:23.250
<i>from being adopted</i>
<i>stop you from having fun.</i>

01:23.334 --> 01:24.919
<i>You're not betraying us</i>
<i>by getting to know</i>

01:25.002 --> 01:26.921
<i>your birth family.</i>

01:27.004 --> 01:29.423
And I'm pretty sure I'm the
only Black person on the lake.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.550
<i>- Just stay away from the tea.</i>
<i>- Baby.</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:32.718
<i>What?</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:39.016
Hold up. Wait.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.226
Are you guys in Greece?

01:40.309 --> 01:41.477
<i>Look, honey--</i>

01:41.560 --> 01:43.521
Internalized feelings my ass!

01:43.604 --> 01:44.980
You just want me to have fun

01:45.064 --> 01:46.899
so you don't feel
bad for having more fun!

01:46.982 --> 01:48.859
<i>Okay, hardly. This</i>
<i>book tour has been relentless.</i>

01:48.943 --> 01:50.778
<i>We barely have a</i>
<i>minute to ourselves.</i>

01:50.861 --> 01:52.655
<i>Honey. The masseuse is here...</i>

01:52.738 --> 01:54.198
Uh?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.991
<i>It’s a working massage.</i>

01:58.035 --> 01:59.662
What? I don't understand.

01:59.745 --> 02:01.622
There's not like a
notwithstanding clause

02:01.705 --> 02:03.457
or anything?
Any kind of loophole?

02:03.541 --> 02:05.793
No, no, no, no.
I don't understand.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.586
If she's not--

02:07.670 --> 02:09.672
This is a family trust.
She’s not fucking family!

02:11.173 --> 02:13.050
No, it was an untimely death.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.178
We're not-- no, there's no
blood relation of any kind.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.681
- Ugh!
- Oh my God!

02:18.764 --> 02:21.475
Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.769
But, it's nice
to hear screams come

02:23.853 --> 02:25.563
- from the old place again.
- Again?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.065
Yeah, I think
there was murder here.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.234
No, wait. I think
it was a kidnapping.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.319
Anyway, Wi-Fi’s up.

02:32.403 --> 02:33.988
Yeah, I know Todd!

02:34.071 --> 02:35.781
No, I'm not raising my voice!
I am not--

02:35.865 --> 02:37.366
- I’m sorry--
- He okay?

02:37.449 --> 02:39.535
He's a bit
operatic when triggered.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.995
Copy that.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.247
I'm Riley, by the way.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.165
I'm Billie.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.542
Pass me my sledge hammer?

02:47.960 --> 02:49.587
Yeah.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.172
What's it for?

02:52.256 --> 02:53.632
Ah, there’s
some things down here

02:53.716 --> 02:55.843
that can chew through wires.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.386
You might want
to go back inside.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.221
- OK.
- Yeah.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.640
Alright.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.812
I have been
working so, so hard this year!

03:06.896 --> 03:08.939
I am a better person!

03:09.023 --> 03:11.066
The lawyer said
that the trust is ironclad

03:11.150 --> 03:13.027
so we don't get the
cottage until Maisy dies.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.236
Maybe when she hears about it,

03:14.320 --> 03:16.864
she'll have a heart attack.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.741
- That's it.
- That's a joke.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.951
No, no, my dad.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.828
My dad must have
put the trust in the box

03:22.912 --> 03:24.705
before he had his
heart attack which means

03:24.788 --> 03:26.916
- Maisy doesn't know about it--
- So tell her.

03:26.999 --> 03:28.918
Maybe you
can work out a timeshare.

03:29.001 --> 03:31.170
No. If Maisy
finds out that the cottage

03:31.253 --> 03:33.005
is coming to me,
she'll bury herself in it.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.840
We're never gonna get it.

03:34.924 --> 03:37.760
You don't know her the
way that I know her, alright?

03:37.843 --> 03:39.803
We once had a crush
on the same lifeguard

03:39.887 --> 03:41.805
and she shrank my bathing
suit to make me look fatter.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.432
Or you got fatter.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.809
They went from
board shorts to a Speedo.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.895
Thank God, I am an only child.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.898
Wait. I am an
only child, right?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.443
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.945
Your Wi-Fi
is all set up.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.322
He fixes cable,
runs the general store--

03:58.405 --> 04:00.407
man, you’re like a
real life handsy-pandy,

04:00.491 --> 04:01.784
like a handyman.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.745
Uh, you want to keep this?

04:04.828 --> 04:07.206
No, no, that's a gift for you.

04:07.289 --> 04:10.417
Sweet. Maybe, see you around?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.503
Yeah, I’d love that.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.629
I mean I would like that.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.340
I would like that.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.176
God, I hope bad game
is a recessive gene.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.345
- That's quite a view--
- Oh, God!

04:21.428 --> 04:23.347
Jesus. Make some
noise when you walk.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.224
Was that Riley just leaving?

04:25.307 --> 04:27.810
Yes, it was Riley. He just
came to install some Wi-Fi.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.895
Uh-huh.

04:29.979 --> 04:33.190
Careful Billie,
bringing cute boys around.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.401
Justin once tried to
steal an old boyfriend of mine

04:35.484 --> 04:37.236
by wearing these
tiny little swim trunks.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.071
- She's lying.
- It didn't work.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.198
Listen, I know it was rough

04:41.281 --> 04:43.325
- hearing how dad--
- Not your dad--

04:43.409 --> 04:45.369
Left me the
cottage but I just want

04:45.452 --> 04:47.413
to make a fresh start.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.499
How about your
Games night!

04:50.582 --> 04:52.209
My place, tonight.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.836
Ooh, we would love
to but we're so busy.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.421
We got lots of like
birth father-daughter

04:55.504 --> 04:56.797
bonding to do.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.590
Well, Billie's invited too.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.592
Everyone's dying
to get to know her.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.512
There'll be drinks, more
drinks. We could play charades!

05:04.805 --> 05:07.808
Wow. That could--
That could be fun.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.476
Perfect. See
you tonight at 8:00.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.936
- Okay.
- Don't even think

05:11.020 --> 05:12.980
- about bringing anything.
- Okay.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.108
Don't even think
about bringing anything?

05:16.191 --> 05:18.360
Was I raised by Wolves?

05:18.444 --> 05:20.279
Two minutes ago,
you wanted to annihilate her

05:20.362 --> 05:22.906
and now we're going over
for white claws and lawn Jenga?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.491
Yes, because games night

05:24.575 --> 05:27.161
is the perfect way
to run her off the lake.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.955
Games night,
where friendly competition

05:30.039 --> 05:32.541
and binge drinking
equals spilled secrets,

05:32.624 --> 05:35.127
rumours spread
and sloppy make outs.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.921
Blood feuds are born
and marriages torched.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.674
And that is how we are going to
take down Maisy.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.342
That is Game of Thrones.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.344
But with a much
more satisfying ending.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.056
Now, the best way to
get rid of an invasive species

05:47.139 --> 05:49.266
is to make its
environment inhospitable.

05:49.349 --> 05:53.020
So, in Maisy's case,
that's family.

05:53.937 --> 05:57.357
Army of skanks-- Friends.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.986
And Cottage.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.989
Is this Mean Girls again?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.282
We're already
becoming a family.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.284
- Mm.
- Step one,

06:07.367 --> 06:09.286
we alienate her
from her friends and family

06:09.369 --> 06:11.205
by exposing a secret so dark

06:11.288 --> 06:13.207
it rocks the foundation of
Maisy's world.

06:13.290 --> 06:14.750
What secret’s bad enough

06:14.833 --> 06:15.918
for someone to
leave their cottage?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.711
Summer of ‘77.

06:17.795 --> 06:20.130
At a Quaalude and metuso game
of two truths and a lie,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.007
Paul Park brags to his friends

06:22.091 --> 06:24.885
that he Munchausen-ed his
dad into disowning his brother.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.304
The cottage was
sold the next summer.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.600
Summer of ‘98,
after two two-fours

06:31.683 --> 06:33.852
and three grams of hash,

06:33.936 --> 06:36.230
Nancy Sweeney confesses
that her brother in law

06:36.313 --> 06:38.524
fingered her at
her sister's wedding.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.317
Ripped the family
apart and the cottage was sold.

06:40.400 --> 06:44.196
Which brings us to step
number three, the cottage.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.739
What happened to step two?

06:45.823 --> 06:47.324
Can't do math
when I'm making a plan.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.159
My grandpa was a
Scottish asshole,

06:49.243 --> 06:50.619
tied with turds and money.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.037
His septic system
alone is enough

06:52.121 --> 06:53.539
to get the cottage condemned.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.332
So if I can find
my grandpa's plans

06:55.415 --> 06:57.126
and bring them to
the county Inspector--

06:57.209 --> 06:58.877
Bam!

06:58.961 --> 07:01.421
Maisy’s gonna have
to fix those violations.

07:02.131 --> 07:03.674
At a huge price.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.135
Yes, question in the back.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.803
Mm-hmm. If it's such

07:07.886 --> 07:09.805
a huge price to fix,
how will you afford it?

07:09.888 --> 07:12.432
Excellent question.
We'll defer to future Justin.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.892
Any other questions? Yes.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.018
Yeah. What's wrong with you?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.146
I was a breeched birth.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.898
Now, once all the
little pieces are lined up,

07:19.982 --> 07:24.027
we just sit back, relax and
watch them fall like dominoes.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.487
We?

07:25.571 --> 07:26.864
There's no “We,”
on Games night.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.949
So it's come to bribery,
has it?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.079
You don't have fun tonight,

07:34.163 --> 07:35.956
I'll leave you alone
for the rest of the summer.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.499
You can even
keep the big bedroom.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.919
And if I do have fun?

07:41.003 --> 07:42.921
Oh, .

07:43.005 --> 07:46.300
We are gonna bond so hard.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.430
Or you're going to
stay here

07:51.513 --> 07:54.474
with whatever Riley
woke up in the pit.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.447
Place looks great, Maiser.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.825
No mention of the reno okay?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.577
I already told the kids.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.038
Is that why you put
Opal’s vision board away?

08:16.121 --> 08:18.457
Well, with
Justin back on the lake,

08:18.540 --> 08:20.459
I just don't want
people talking again.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.836
You remember what it was like
when I first got the cottage.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.589
Oh, no, of course you don't.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.257
You had just been
traded to Pittsburgh.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.010
Ah, yes. The lost years.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.262
Relax, hon...

08:32.346 --> 08:35.599
Once the Boathouse
president approves our plans,

08:35.682 --> 08:37.601
the renos are all good.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.311
And I hear she's got

08:39.394 --> 08:41.521
the elections
locked up this year.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.523
You don't understand.
People said

08:43.607 --> 08:46.485
that I slept with my stepdad
to get him to change the will,

08:46.568 --> 08:48.695
that I bribed the board.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.781
But didn't you bribe the board?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.449
I incentivized.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.451
Once I'm re-elected,
nothing can keep us

08:54.534 --> 08:56.453
from our dream cottage.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.581
But if Justin’s happy, then
he won't cause any trouble.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.458
And we all know
what makes Justin happy.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.418
Right.

09:03.502 --> 09:04.878
Nope, not a clue.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.797
- Knock-knock!

09:06.880 --> 09:08.715
Not a word.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.133
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.469
Look who brought
nana’s bean dip.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.222
Seven layers of
dietary restrictions. Yum.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.600
- You remember Opal?
- Hi.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.102
Hello.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.478
And Killian.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.272
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.316
Thank you so much for having
us over It's really nice.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.068
Victor,
why don't you and Killian

09:28.151 --> 09:30.404
give these two a
tour of the cottage?

09:30.487 --> 09:33.490
Yay! Oh,
I feel like an exiled Romanov

09:33.573 --> 09:35.784
returning to
his ancestral dacha

09:35.867 --> 09:38.161
after it was
stolen by the unwashed mob.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.039
Did they
bring bean dip to the dacha?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.167
Yeah, I just can't
believe that we've never met.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.836
Oh, I was playing for Tampa,
back then.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.963
- Wasn't around much.
- Oh, hello!

09:48.046 --> 09:49.506
Oh yeah. Yeah.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.049
Is it weird being
in your family cottage?

09:51.133 --> 09:53.176
No,
it's not really my family.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.387
What's weird is my
Black parents being obsessed

09:55.470 --> 09:57.014
with me connecting
over my white roots.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.849
Like, they're
worried I'll lose a kidney

09:58.932 --> 10:00.684
- and need a donor or something.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.728
Yeah, my mom's
the exact same way.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.646
Like, I like
dumplings and everything

10:04.730 --> 10:06.648
but does she have to bring ‘em
to every school barbecue?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.860
That's why I
love the lake so much

10:09.943 --> 10:12.237
because all
the shit fades away.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.072
Is that you.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.574
Where?

10:15.657 --> 10:17.200
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.537
With my grandpa,

10:20.620 --> 10:22.039
or um, our grandpa--

10:23.540 --> 10:25.292
Justin's dad.

10:26.501 --> 10:27.961
What was he like?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.755
He was really fun.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.174
He was always up
for something just crazy.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.553
You have the same eyes.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.096
Hey honey.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.266
Honey, can you
guys come in here please?

10:41.350 --> 10:45.479
Everything looks the same,
smells the same.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.191
Feels the same.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.526
Stop that. Stop that.

10:51.610 --> 10:53.737
It's so nice to
have the family back together.

10:53.820 --> 10:54.988
Sure.

10:55.072 --> 10:57.741
- Wassup!
- Wassup!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.159
Moore, party of six!

10:59.242 --> 11:00.494
- Here ya go.
- Hi.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.412
- Lovejoy, up top?
- Sure, hey Wayne.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.414
Billie!

11:04.498 --> 11:05.957
- Wayne.
- Yikes.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.459
Did you see the
links that I sent?

11:07.542 --> 11:08.710
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

11:08.794 --> 11:09.878
- Jayne.
- Sorry.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.465
Hey.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.342
Hey.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.887
You were so
zooted the other night.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.390
She means thank you
for not ratting them out.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.433
Oh. Snitches
get stitches, right?

11:23.517 --> 11:24.643
Why?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.395
Oh, it's just uh...

11:28.230 --> 11:29.648
Never mind.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.441
We're hanging at
the fire pit. Wanna come?

11:32.317 --> 11:33.360
I'm good.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.486
Okay.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031
Oh, my God--

11:38.115 --> 11:39.699
Guys, wait.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.368
They’re not as
bad as you think.

11:41.451 --> 11:42.744
They
made people believe

11:42.828 --> 11:44.037
I stole coconut cream vodka.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.747
You don't come back from that.

11:45.831 --> 11:47.374
They've been doing dumb shit
like that

11:47.457 --> 11:49.418
to me since we were kids.
You get used to it.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.336
No way, man.
You shouldn't, either.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.590
I think I'll
just hang here tonight.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.592
If you're
staying for Games night,

11:57.676 --> 11:59.553
you're going to
need some backup.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.179
To play a bunch of dumb games?

12:01.263 --> 12:02.848
Shit gets real when
boomers are three gins in

12:02.931 --> 12:04.724
and they’re six points down.

12:04.808 --> 12:06.560
Okay, well, we're
probably going to have to have

12:06.643 --> 12:08.186
a safe word if
we need to bounce.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.355
- Okay.
- Okay? So...

12:10.439 --> 12:12.023
Um.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.444
Dumplings.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.905
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.118
- Oh.
- Hey.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.703
- Justin.
- Jayne.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.496
So, Jayne would like me

12:26.580 --> 12:29.499
to apologize to
you for taking a leak

12:29.583 --> 12:32.335
in your sleeping bag
at your dad's 50th kegger.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.796
I am sorry.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.256
If he’d known
that they would call you

12:36.339 --> 12:37.883
Pisstopher Robin all summer--

12:37.966 --> 12:39.426
My dad
didn't have a 50th kegger.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.720
- Total rager. Yeah.
- Yes, he did.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.597
Party of the year.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.141
Why wasn't I invited to
my dad's 50th birthday kegger?

12:46.224 --> 12:48.101
I guess that's what he wanted.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.311
Ah...

12:50.437 --> 12:51.855
Cool.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.440
Cool, cool, cool.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.941
Well, you know what?

12:55.025 --> 12:56.693
Since the games
have already begun,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.445
why don't we kick things off

12:58.528 --> 13:00.572
with a quick round
of Never Have I Ever?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.199
- Oh. Yeah.
- Right?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.450
I haven't
played this since like,

13:03.533 --> 13:04.743
I don't know how long.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.369
Hands up, Maisy.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.580
Um, let's see. Oh God, oh God.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.707
Oh God. Never have I ever.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.044
Oh, never have I ever had
relations with a puck bunny.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.963
- Yeah!
- Dude.

13:17.631 --> 13:20.008
- Victor.
- No. Okay.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.594
Never have I ever

13:22.677 --> 13:24.054
relieved myself
on someone's

13:24.137 --> 13:26.056
imported Spice Girls sleeping
bag.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.432
Wayne.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.767
Guilty.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.895
Thanks, Jayne.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.731
No.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.525
Never have I ever,
never have I ever--

13:36.608 --> 13:38.068
Oh God, what else could I--

13:38.151 --> 13:40.529
Never have I ever
sucked Wayne's dick

13:40.612 --> 13:42.572
while Jayne was
getting her first aborsh.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.117
Dominoes.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.995
Ah, fine.

13:50.705 --> 13:52.290
But it's a good
thing you brought up

13:52.374 --> 13:54.251
before Wayne had his
third drink, am I right?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.629
He says it every year.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.673
I told Jayne at her senior prom

13:59.756 --> 14:01.925
and then we ended up
getting drunk and making out.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.677
Best night of my life.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.262
- Hm?
- Hey, everybody.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.721
- Riley.
- Oh, hey bud.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.181
- How you doing?
- Hi.

14:08.265 --> 14:10.100
Hi. Hi.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.018
Hi.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.729
This is perfect timing.
Now, we can play partner games.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.106
You and Justin can be together.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.317
Hey, bean dip.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.320
I made that.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.782
Is that what
makes Justin happy?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.410
- Everyone, it's time.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.495
As my bed time is 10,
I've divided each game

14:30.579 --> 14:32.205
- into rounds of five.
- Mm.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.624
Great.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.966
You got this, Mais.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.722
Okay.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.392
The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly!

14:52.475 --> 14:53.518
- Yes!
- Yes!

14:53.602 --> 14:55.270
- What?

14:55.353 --> 14:57.355
- I friggin’ love you.
- I love you.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.614
Ass.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.365
Falcon and the Ass man. No.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.200
Splinter in the--

15:09.284 --> 15:10.702
Splinter in the ass.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.120
Indiana Jones
and the Ass Crusade!

15:12.203 --> 15:13.246
- Ugh.

15:13.330 --> 15:14.539
Time.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.001
James and the Giant Peach.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.337
Not every peach
is an ass, Wayne.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.506
The one behind you is a peach.

15:37.187 --> 15:38.480
Kill.

15:40.857 --> 15:41.900
Bill--

15:44.903 --> 15:46.279
Oh, Kill Bill!

15:46.363 --> 15:47.530
- It’s Kill Bill!
- Yes!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.417
Alright.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.588
Opal, can I get a
little help with this?

16:05.548 --> 16:07.801
It's the foundation on
which all gay cinema is built.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.680
Mean Girls.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.150
Well, my bombshell was a bust.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.277
I wasn't invited to my
father's 50th birthday party

16:26.361 --> 16:28.697
and Maisy is some
kind of charades witch.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.365
So I would really
like to go. Please.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.658
I don't care
about the big bedroom.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.326
You win, it's yours.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.537
Okay, so your
plan didn’t work...

16:36.496 --> 16:37.664
What about Riley?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.082
Yes. I mean, he is.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.542
He's very cute.
He's really cute.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.335
I mean, he's got--
What? No.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.212
Stop it. You are just
trying to trick me.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.047
You just want to
stay here so you can

16:46.131 --> 16:47.757
keep hanging out with Killian.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.718
I’m saying it because
he's obviously into you.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.553
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.726
Oh my God. Oh my God,
no, I can't do this.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.936
I can't, not tonight.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.981
Oh. Opal's vegan cheese
made you gassy.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.567
No, I don't feel ready.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.235
I was divorced, like yesterday.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.945
I'm not wearing
any of the right clo--

17:09.028 --> 17:10.655
Yes, fine. Opal’s
vegan cheese made me gassy.

17:10.739 --> 17:11.865
Are you happy?

17:11.948 --> 17:13.616
No, no one's happy about that.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.660
I just want to go, please.
I'd really like to go.

17:15.744 --> 17:16.828
Well, what about
your grandpa’s plans?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.788
You can still steal them.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.124
They may not even be here,
I don't know.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.752
I believe in you,
Justin Lovejoy.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.879
You are like the Roman mob,
remember?

17:25.962 --> 17:27.380
Taking back the family dogs

17:27.464 --> 17:29.048
from the dirty Russians and--

17:29.132 --> 17:30.592
Oh, my God, please stop.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.844
You’re butchering
a perfect metaphor.

17:32.927 --> 17:35.388
Alright, fine. But as
soon as we steal those plans,

17:35.472 --> 17:37.015
we’re gone. Alright?

17:37.098 --> 17:39.100
Fine. But I'm not sitting
behind you in the canoe.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.229
Wouldn’t it be so
funny if Maisy and me

17:43.313 --> 17:45.982
just like made out,
like right now?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.358
Dumplings.

17:47.442 --> 17:48.860
Yes. Come on.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.570
I'm going to show
you something so amazing.

17:50.653 --> 17:53.156
Okay, you guys. Opal’s in bed,

17:53.239 --> 17:55.200
so let's make this
next game a quiet one.

17:55.283 --> 17:57.494
Hearts. No, duck-duck-goose.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.204
How about Sardines?

17:59.287 --> 18:00.789
Hm.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.207
Like hide and seek?

18:02.290 --> 18:03.666
Well, it's uh,
it’s kind of like

18:03.750 --> 18:05.627
a reverse hide and seek

18:05.710 --> 18:07.462
where like, one person hides
and then everybody else looks.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.172
And then when
you find the hider,

18:09.255 --> 18:11.508
you hide with them until
the last person finds you.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.551
Justin always
wanted to play this game

18:13.635 --> 18:15.553
when we were kids so he
could sneak into my bedroom

18:15.637 --> 18:17.347
and read my diary.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.890
You taught me the game!

18:18.973 --> 18:20.099
I'll save you the trouble.

18:20.183 --> 18:21.601
I don't keep a diary anymore

18:21.684 --> 18:23.978
but my vibrator is in the
bedside table.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.897
- I'm down.
- I also want that.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.066
- I will play.
- It could be fun.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.651
I'll hide first.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.910
So, s'mores
aren't just graham crackers,

18:38.993 --> 18:41.246
chocolate and marshmallows.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.499
Okay, well,
they're kind of are.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.792
Yeah.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.335
But uh,
you can also use

18:47.418 --> 18:48.878
pretzels or Ritz crackers,

18:48.962 --> 18:50.922
milk chocolate
or dark chocolate.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.549
And then there's
the mini marshmallows

18:52.632 --> 18:54.008
or the jumbo marshmallows.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.135
Well, it looks yummy

18:56.219 --> 18:59.389
but I thought you were going
to show me somethin’ amazin’.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.807
You think you're ready?

19:00.890 --> 19:02.725
Oh, I was born ready.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.358
I don't get it,
what are you doing?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.652
Nothing.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.612
Nothing?

19:14.696 --> 19:17.657
Yeah, I'm not
so good at nothing.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.617
I mean, plus there's
no such thing as nothing.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.910
I mean, even breathing,
it's like something--

19:20.994 --> 19:22.912
Look.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.756
Nothing.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.430
What's up, fam?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.765
Oh, my God, you guys
would make the cutest babies.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.393
Oh, my God,
you can't just say that, dummy.

20:31.481 --> 20:35.485
Lance Bass! Aw! We're
back in sync, baby.

20:45.787 --> 20:49.207
No, no, no, no, Maisy here.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.708
Perfect.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.587
I got you all to myself.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.631
Oh, whoa, um.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.925
Uh, sorry, I thought

20:59.008 --> 21:01.302
I was getting a games night,

21:01.386 --> 21:03.346
sloppy makeout vibe from you.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.722
No, no, you were.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.057
There was totally a vibe.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.266
We were totally vibing.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.268
It's just um, full disclosh--

21:09.352 --> 21:13.523
I am pretty freshly divorced
and very badly out of practice.

21:13.606 --> 21:17.902
Uh, the beard tat dating
trauma that you mentioned

21:17.986 --> 21:19.445
at the Gas and Go.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.239
That's the one.

21:21.322 --> 21:26.577
You know, I have this scar
and some like chin zits,

21:26.661 --> 21:29.288
um, like to,

21:29.372 --> 21:31.624
tighten it up and cover...

21:32.208 --> 21:33.668
Why are you smiling?

21:33.751 --> 21:36.629
‘Cause triggered is my kink.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.841
Ah. Oh.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.759
Do you, um,

21:42.927 --> 21:44.846
do you wanna
play my favourite game?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.474
Yeah.

21:48.558 --> 21:50.560
So now Justin has
Riley to obsess over

21:50.643 --> 21:52.937
and he won't care
about the renovation.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.605
You're brilliant.

21:54.689 --> 21:58.151
I know. Justin
always went after the hot guy

21:58.234 --> 22:00.111
that was out of his
league only to be disappointed

22:00.194 --> 22:02.071
when they rejected him.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.949
I don't know. Him and Riley
seem to be hitting it off.

22:05.033 --> 22:07.243
Oh, Justin may
have lost the weight

22:07.326 --> 22:09.120
but trust me,
he is still a train wreck.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.956
Riley will see
that and dump him.

22:12.040 --> 22:14.375
The pain and the
shame will give Justin

22:14.459 --> 22:16.544
two more reasons to run away.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.296
Cool.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.256
Wanna play seven
minutes in heaven?

22:21.549 --> 22:23.301
You dirty dog.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.552
Yes.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.597
Mm-mn.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.810
Fuzzy bunnies!

22:33.519 --> 22:34.937
Eight marshmallows!

22:35.021 --> 22:36.606
Okay, Kerri!

22:38.149 --> 22:39.484
Your turn, Killian.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.194
Truth or dare?

22:42.570 --> 22:44.322
Dare.

22:44.405 --> 22:47.325
I dare you to sit in
the outhouse for five minutes.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.998
Make it a double dare.
We’ll do it together.

22:54.749 --> 22:57.752
In that case, we dare
you to go into the outhouse

22:57.835 --> 22:59.087
and swap clothes.

22:59.170 --> 23:00.630
What?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.715
Done.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.718
Janie, can you believe how good
I look in Victor's clothes?

23:05.802 --> 23:07.303
I mean, sleeves are a bit big,

23:07.386 --> 23:10.264
waist a little bit
tight but I'm a snack.

23:11.557 --> 23:13.434
I found it.

23:16.687 --> 23:19.941
The astral nebula.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.611
Why is it so special?

23:23.694 --> 23:25.738
You have to apply to get one.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.323
I've been turned down.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.491
Twice.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.703
How ‘bout a demo, babe?

23:36.457 --> 23:38.417
Have fun.

23:42.547 --> 23:46.467
Okay, five minutes starting...

23:46.551 --> 23:48.219
- Now.
- Hate to admit this

23:48.302 --> 23:50.555
but this is
totally on brand for me.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.557
Every time I try to help,
I end up in shit.

23:58.271 --> 23:59.689
Pass me your shorts.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.568
What's the matter?

24:03.651 --> 24:05.611
No, I'm just--
I'm just a bit claustrophobic.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.321
That's why they
dared me to do this.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.031
So why didn't
you just say, “No?”

24:09.115 --> 24:10.658
I didn't want
to embarrass myself.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.411
I see my mistake now.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.999
Uh, no big, we’ll
just do another dare. Okay?

24:18.082 --> 24:19.667
Okay, yeah.

24:23.171 --> 24:24.881
Oh no.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.424
It's okay, stay calm.
We got this. Yeah?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.176
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.844
Okay.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.846
Some
bitches are getting stitches.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.892
What up, Opie-dopes?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.895
Couldn’t sleep. My parents are
fooling around in my closet.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.147
Must run in the family.

24:41.230 --> 24:43.232
Yeah... Your
brother and his cousin

24:43.316 --> 24:45.401
are naked in the outhouse.

24:51.574 --> 24:53.367
Billie and Killian are
having sex in the outhouse!

24:53.451 --> 24:55.244
- Yes!
- No!

24:56.370 --> 24:57.622
Is that bad?

24:58.873 --> 25:00.249
- That's bad.
- Yeah.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.084
Oh, God.

25:02.168 --> 25:06.631
I'm so, so close. So close.

25:06.714 --> 25:09.842
Yes babe, yes babe, yes babe.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.053
Oh!

25:12.136 --> 25:13.512
Yes... Babe--

25:13.596 --> 25:14.889
Oh!

25:15.765 --> 25:17.642
C’mon, Killian.
Just think of something else.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.101
Yeah, I'm trying.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.728
I'm almost, there!

25:26.567 --> 25:28.152
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just...

25:32.740 --> 25:34.116
Your shoulder’s bleeding.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.701
What? Oh my God.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.245
Oh my God.
My birth daughter's bleeding!

25:37.328 --> 25:38.913
My birth daughter’s bleeding!

25:38.996 --> 25:40.539
It’s okay.
I got it. I got it!

25:40.623 --> 25:41.749
You don't know
where anything is.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.209
I do. I do.

25:43.292 --> 25:45.461
What's happening?
What happened?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.756
Looks like
your hell spawn struck again.

25:49.966 --> 25:51.008
Is that my shirt?

25:51.092 --> 25:52.468
Yeah.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.929
Does anybody else
hear that buzzing sound?

25:55.012 --> 25:57.223
Uh, we should
hit the road. Huh?

25:57.306 --> 25:59.850
Good night, guys.
Thank you for a great night.

25:59.934 --> 26:01.185
Thank you.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.818
- Do you think?
- Oh, yes.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.403
I mean, yeah.

26:10.486 --> 26:11.737
Go Wayne.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.740
Can you get
tetanus from an outhouse?

26:14.824 --> 26:16.158
Is that a thing?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.910
I think you'll survive.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.538
Oh, you have a better
chance if you stand still.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.290
What about ticks?

26:22.373 --> 26:23.916
My mom says you can
get Lyme disease here

26:24.000 --> 26:25.584
from all the nature.

26:25.668 --> 26:27.878
Lyme disease is
really having a moment, huh?

26:27.962 --> 26:29.964
Justin Bieber did so
much for that disease.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.133
I think you're safe.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.722
You and Kilian
make a great team.

26:37.805 --> 26:39.181
Almost second place.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.558
Uh, I know. I feel so bad.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.184
It's my fault he took the dare.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.312
He didn't want me to
know he's claustrophobic.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.524
No, it is not your fault.
Let me guess.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.527
It rhymes with very,
hairy and scary?

26:51.610 --> 26:54.280
Not a lot of cool
girls on the lake your age.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.866
Don't worry,
Sarah will be here soon.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.409
You two will get along great.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.453
Oh, cool.
Does Sarah have a cottage here?

27:00.536 --> 27:01.912
No, no. She stays with us.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.497
She's Killian's girlfriend.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.585
There you go. Good as new.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.963
Thanks.

27:17.011 --> 27:19.305
God. Promised her
parents she'd have fun

27:19.388 --> 27:21.432
but not like
bleeding in an outhouse fun.

27:21.515 --> 27:22.641
Jesus.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.895
Sorry, hot mess alert.

27:27.980 --> 27:31.317
Who plays very
cool Connect Four.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.278
Maybe you’d wanna play
board games again, sometime?

27:35.696 --> 27:37.490
Unless you're playing
board games with somebody else

27:37.573 --> 27:39.658
‘cause you can play board
games with whoever you want.

27:39.742 --> 27:42.411
I'm not one of those like,
hetero-boardative queers.

27:42.495 --> 27:45.081
Nope. Not, not this guy.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.502
Okay, I'm down for a rematch.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.212
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.089
I'll wait for you on the dock.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.926
I should get goin’ as well.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.761
Yeah.

27:58.844 --> 28:00.513
Thanks for
a great night, Maisy.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.849
Oh yes, my pleasure.
Get home, safely.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.309
Maybe see you around?

28:05.393 --> 28:06.977
Yeah. Around. Over,
under, whatever.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.271
I'm flexible ‘cause--
because I do yoga.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.357
Goodnight.

28:12.942 --> 28:14.985
Thanks for
the trip down memory lane.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.405
As far as Game nights go,
it wasn't one of the worst.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.824
I'm so glad you had fun.

28:19.907 --> 28:22.952
And Billie turned
out to be a lovely girl.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.039
Do you mind if I borrow this?

28:27.123 --> 28:28.916
The murder cabin is
kind of short on fun.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.209
Oh yeah, of course.

28:30.292 --> 28:31.585
Take it as long as you want.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.295
Great.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.590
Mi casa es su casa.

28:36.674 --> 28:37.883
Not yet.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.720
So why is he an asshole?

28:41.804 --> 28:44.306
Because he has a girlfriend.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.309
We have this amazing
time together and then--

28:47.393 --> 28:49.311
So you did have fun.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.356
Ugh, fine. You win.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.692
But I'm pulling
the adoption card

28:54.775 --> 28:55.901
and keeping the big bedroom.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.862
Yeah, you can play that once.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.363
Maybe a few times.

28:59.447 --> 29:01.073
Kilian should have told me.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.326
Well, did he like,
say or try anything creepy?

29:04.410 --> 29:06.787
No. He made me s'mores

29:07.663 --> 29:08.956
and they were delicious.

29:09.415 --> 29:10.875
What does making
a s’more even mean

29:10.958 --> 29:12.251
in boy language.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.878
I think it means
that he likes you.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.257
And that he has a girlfriend.
Both can be true.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.594
But the summer is long

29:21.677 --> 29:24.805
and long distance
relationships are really hard.

29:24.889 --> 29:26.807
Why do you think I
stayed with my ex in Australia?

29:26.891 --> 29:28.309
Because you were
running from your life

29:28.392 --> 29:29.894
and it's crushing misery.

29:29.977 --> 29:32.062
All right, look.
Not all is lost, okay?

29:32.146 --> 29:34.482
Because you had
fun with Killian,

29:34.565 --> 29:37.193
I stole my grandpa's plans.

29:42.406 --> 29:44.241
Paint swatches?

29:44.325 --> 29:45.367
Order numbers?

29:45.451 --> 29:46.869
What the fuck is this?

29:46.952 --> 29:48.537
What the hell is
rustic boho minimalism?

29:48.621 --> 29:50.456
She's gonna tear
the whole thing down.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.709
A-ha!

29:53.792 --> 29:55.628
Bring it down, Sherlock--

29:55.711 --> 29:57.129
Boat House Committee meeting,

29:57.213 --> 29:59.423
construction permits,
approvals?

29:59.507 --> 30:01.509
Oh my God!

30:01.592 --> 30:03.552
This is why Maisy hid this!

30:03.636 --> 30:05.221
She didn’t want me to find out

30:05.304 --> 30:07.223
about her reno
before it went to the board.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.099
So why invite
you to Games night?

30:09.183 --> 30:11.936
Because Billie,
because she's diabolical.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.437
Of course--

30:13.521 --> 30:15.231
What
better way to play me

30:15.314 --> 30:17.775
than by showing me that
she's got nothing to hide?

30:17.858 --> 30:19.777
But...

30:19.860 --> 30:22.613
if we could get the
board to stop her reno,

30:22.696 --> 30:23.906
then she wouldn't be able

30:23.989 --> 30:25.991
to demolish our family legacy.

30:26.075 --> 30:28.452
Boat House
elections are tomorrow.

30:28.536 --> 30:30.412
We need to game her,

30:30.496 --> 30:32.915
the same way that she
thinks she's gaming us.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.000
And the best part is,

30:35.084 --> 30:37.378
she has no idea we’re coming.

30:41.006 --> 30:42.341
Game and match.
