If I can be just a little better
than him, I can slink away

It says he once struck out
when his tongue got stuck
to an unusually cold bat.

Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you
play so blowfully? The original
Hank Aaron was great.

14:21.727 --> 14:25.731
No, I was better than great.
I was the home run king.

- Neat!
- So, Hank-- the bad Hank--

14:29.735 --> 14:33.240
just how blowful were you?
Well, I had a low
batting average.

Low? It was zero, you fungo.
You went your whole career
without getting a hit.

One thing she can do
is lodge a ball in
