[laughing]

00:54.288 --> 00:55.089
Mom.

00:55.189 --> 00:55.989
What?

00:56.090 --> 00:57.057
I got a knot in my shoe.

00:57.158 --> 00:57.958
Wear loafers.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.363
Come on, Mom.

01:02.463 --> 01:06.200
All right, give it here.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.169
Can I have pie for breakfast?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.671
No, that's contaminated.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.540
Go sit down and eat
your breakfast now.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.675
And don't spill your
milk today, neither.

01:14.775 --> 01:15.576
Here you go.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.613
Is there coffee?

01:19.713 --> 01:21.048
Dan.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.015
Yeah?

01:22.116 --> 01:25.119
Isn't there coffee
every morning?

01:25.219 --> 01:26.019
Yes.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.192
In the 15 years
we've been married,

01:31.292 --> 01:35.429
has there ever been one morning
where there wasn't any coffee?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.931
No.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.800
Then why do you have
to ask me every morning

01:39.900 --> 01:42.170
if there's coffee?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.070
Is there toast?

01:51.745 --> 01:53.514
What's going on with you?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.783
Mother, this is
very important.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.018
Our school's having a food
drive for poor people.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.822
Well, tell them to drive
some of that food over here.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.157
Mother.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.492
Two cans, that's it.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.627
Don't touch that creamed corn.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.028
[phone ringing]

02:08.128 --> 02:09.463
I'll get it.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.431
Hello?

02:10.531 --> 02:11.332
Mom!

02:11.432 --> 02:12.333
- He started it.
- Did not.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.701
- You little creep.
- You pig face.

02:13.801 --> 02:14.568
ROSEANNE: Knock it off, you two.
Stop it.

02:14.668 --> 02:15.669
Get away, get away.
- Ugh.

02:15.769 --> 02:16.970
ROSEANNE: Sit down.
- Listen to your mother.

02:17.070 --> 02:17.938
You heard your father.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.310
Connie, don't tell him that.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.612
Get off the phone.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.513
Mom.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.780
Now.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.981
I gotta go.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.383
Bye.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.119
Dad, you know what'd be
really good for breakfast?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.020
What?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.188
Pie.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.122
Tell him no.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.023
No.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.328
[phone ringing]

02:41.529 --> 02:42.563
Oh, hi.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.398
I looked in the mirror,
and I'm getting boobs.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.238
Becky can't talk now.

02:53.207 --> 02:55.443
Oh, my gosh, I was
supposed to give you this.

02:55.543 --> 02:56.644
What is it?

02:56.744 --> 02:58.479
It's a note from my
history teacher, Miss Crane.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.813
You gotta meet with her at 3:15.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.714
Today?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.182
Uh-huh.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.184
Why do you always
wait to the last minute

03:04.285 --> 03:05.519
to tell me these things?

03:05.619 --> 03:06.820
I've got a life too, you know?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.389
It's not like I don't
have nothing to do.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.657
I'm sorry.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.459
What do you want me to do,
throw myself off a bridge?

03:11.559 --> 03:15.263
Yeah, and take your
brother and sister with you.

03:15.363 --> 03:16.864
[horn honking]

03:17.998 --> 03:19.400
You guys didn't even
brush your teeth.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.868
We don't have time.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.803
We'll miss the bus.

03:22.903 --> 03:23.771
Thank you.

03:23.871 --> 03:24.805
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.739
ROSEANNE: Bye.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.808
DAN: Bye.
- Quick, they're gone.

03:27.908 --> 03:28.709
Change the locks.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.349
What is it?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.450
I really don't wanna pick.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.718
What?

03:37.818 --> 03:39.052
I can't stand it
when people leave

03:39.152 --> 03:40.321
toast crumbs on the butter.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.855
Well, what difference
does it make?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.324
You're just gonna
smear it on your toast.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.025
- It ain't right.
- Ugh.

03:45.125 --> 03:46.260
You don't like it
when people leave

03:46.360 --> 03:47.861
jelly in the peanut butter jar.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.029
Well, that's sickening.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.833
- Same thing.
- It is not.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.167
- Afraid so.
- No, it is not.

03:54.268 --> 03:55.336
- Afraid so.
- Oh, all right.

03:55.436 --> 03:59.473
Here, nice, fresh butter.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.508
Knock yourself out.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.513
(SOUTHERN DRAWL)
I love you, darling.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.947
[laughing]

04:07.047 --> 04:08.316
(SOUTHERN DRAWL) I love you too.

04:08.416 --> 04:09.650
[horn honking]

04:09.750 --> 04:11.218
Save me that detergent coupon.

04:11.319 --> 04:12.119
Becky!

04:14.755 --> 04:15.556
Dan.

04:15.656 --> 04:16.457
What?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.191
The sink's all
backed up again.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.993
I'll plunge it
right after breakfast.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.495
Well, I don't want
you to plunge it.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.497
I want you to fix it now.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.498
You got it, babe.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.933
Now this is the
third time this week.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.267
You've gotta fix it today.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.402
Absolutely.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.838
BECKY: Mom, my bookbag
just fell apart.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.172
I just bought it yesterday.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.206
[horn honking]

04:33.307 --> 04:35.208
Mom, please, you
gotta take it back.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.510
All right, I'll
do it after work.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.411
Thanks.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.379
Oh.

04:38.479 --> 04:39.279
Bye.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.180
Goodbye.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.018
Could you meet with
Darlene's teacher today?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.219
I can't do it today, babe.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.655
I'm putting in a bid on a job.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.222
And if I get it,
me and Freddy start

04:49.323 --> 04:51.024
construction this afternoon.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.326
Well, how about this bookbag?

04:52.426 --> 04:53.527
Can you exchange that?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.195
Could you fit that into
your tight schedule there?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.333
Either that or fix the sink.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.035
ROSEANNE: OK, fix the sink.

05:02.135 --> 05:05.839
I'll do everything
else, like I always do.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.676
I'll have to get off work an
hour early, lose an hour's pay,

05:08.776 --> 05:10.010
totally rearrange
my whole schedule.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.581
But I don't mind.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.491
Are you ever sorry
we got married?

05:23.591 --> 05:24.592
Every second of my life.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.562
Me too.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.031
You are, really?

05:31.131 --> 05:31.999
[laughs]

05:32.099 --> 05:33.467
Nah.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.535
OK, me neither then.

05:34.635 --> 05:35.436
DAN: OK.

05:39.507 --> 05:43.511
Hey, who would you have
married if you didn't marry me?

05:43.611 --> 05:44.412
Rosie.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.647
Come on, who?

05:46.747 --> 05:48.248
No one.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.883
Oh, I'm sure
you wouldn't have.

05:49.983 --> 05:51.619
Who?

05:51.719 --> 05:53.286
This time I swear
I won't get mad.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.187
I know.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.155
Beth Winchester.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.256
Are you kidding?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.157
Come on.

05:57.257 --> 05:58.158
I'm not gonna get mad.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.660
I just want you to
tell me the truth.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.594
I swear I'm not getting mad.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.262
Just tell.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.532
Josephine Carter.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.299
Josephine Carter,
that old slut?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.772
She had great toes.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.040
Toes?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.542
Yeah.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.477
She used to sit there
and cross her legs

06:16.577 --> 06:21.114
and dangle her shoe
off the end of her toe.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.315
Drove me crazy.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.517
[laughs]

06:23.617 --> 06:24.885
So you're gonna
marry her for that?

06:24.985 --> 06:25.786
Yes, ma'am.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.088
Well, why didn't you?

06:28.188 --> 06:31.158
Well, the morning
I was gonna propose,

06:31.258 --> 06:32.392
I took her over to
this little coffee

06:32.493 --> 06:37.030
shop, real quiet,
out of the way place.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.833
And just as I was about
to pop the question,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.669
she smeared toast crumbs
all over her butter.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.570
ROSEANNE: [laughing]

06:42.670 --> 06:43.837
That was it.
I got up.

06:43.937 --> 06:44.738
I left.

06:44.838 --> 06:47.741
I didn't even pay the check.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.842
[laughs]

06:48.942 --> 06:50.878
Oh, you think you're
pretty cute, don't you?

06:50.978 --> 06:53.380
Pretty much.

06:53.481 --> 06:54.347
Ow.

06:54.448 --> 06:57.751
[music playing]

06:59.553 --> 07:02.322
Booker, I gotta get
off an hour early today.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.491
Uh, no, I can't do it.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.326
We're 200 cases behind
on that Gillman order.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.495
But I gotta, Booker.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.962
It is really, really important.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.764
You have to
understand my position.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.066
Well, you have to understand
my position, Booker.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.936
I gotta go to the school and
talk to my kid's teacher.

07:16.036 --> 07:21.775
Roseanne, here at Wellman
Plastics, we are a team.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.977
And I'd like to make
us a winning team.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.013
All the players are
equally as important.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.048
The running backs are no more
important than the pulling

07:28.148 --> 07:29.416
guards.
The pulling guards are no more--

07:29.517 --> 07:30.317
ROSEANNE: Yeah, I got it.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.251
I got it.

07:31.351 --> 07:35.055
It's like a big
old quilting bee.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.323
A what?

07:36.423 --> 07:38.191
You know, where all the
barefoot women on the prairie

07:38.291 --> 07:39.426
get together, you know?

07:39.527 --> 07:42.329
And they all stitch this
one really incredible quilt.

07:42.429 --> 07:45.398
And no one patch is any more
important than any other patch,

07:45.499 --> 07:46.734
kind of thing, you know?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.435
Uh-huh.

07:48.536 --> 07:51.238
Well, the woman sewing this
patch has to get off an hour

07:51.338 --> 07:53.140
early today, Booker.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.307
Look, Roseanne--

07:54.407 --> 07:55.509
I'm looking, Booker.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.409
Come on.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.345
Gimme a break.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.147
All right, I'll give
you a half an hour,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.249
and it's coming
out of your check.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.718
Well, there goes the Porsche.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.187
Oh, I just love it when
a guy talks sports.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.423
It does something to me.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.159
The only thing that's
more exciting than that

08:12.259 --> 08:16.096
is when Dan talks about
hydraulic jacks and snow tires.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.531
You can joke all you want.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.499
You got yourself the ideal man.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.734
Oh, ideal, huh?

08:20.834 --> 08:21.802
Sure.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.737
I'd give anything to
have a man like Dan.

08:23.837 --> 08:24.638
He stays home.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.639
He never runs round on you.

08:25.739 --> 08:26.640
He's good to the kids.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.541
And he's hygienic.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.412
Well, Crystal, you
think he came that way?

08:36.316 --> 08:38.586
It's 15 years of fighting
that made him like that.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.820
Oh, you are so full of it.

08:39.920 --> 08:40.721
[scoffs]

08:40.821 --> 08:41.989
I'm serious.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.857
A good man don't just happen.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.158
They have to be
created by us women.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.059
WOMAN 1: Oh, right.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.996
WOMAN 2: That's right.

08:49.096 --> 08:49.897
Huh?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.431
You think you know everything.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.834
Well, I do know
everything, Crystal.

08:53.934 --> 08:57.738
A guy is a lump,
like this donut.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.973
OK, so first, you
gotta get rid of all

09:00.073 --> 09:01.909
the stuff his mom did to him.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.343
[laughter]

09:05.378 --> 09:07.948
And then you gotta get
rid of all that macho crap

09:08.048 --> 09:09.883
that they pick up from
the beer commercials.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.784
[laughter]

09:12.152 --> 09:15.656
And then there's my personal
favorite, the male ego.

09:15.756 --> 09:19.092
[laughter]

09:20.661 --> 09:22.529
[whistle blows]

09:25.565 --> 09:26.433
That's hysterical.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.334
Hi, sis.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.669
Hi.
Roseanne?

09:28.769 --> 09:29.770
What?

09:29.870 --> 09:33.306
You realize that
most people use only 2%

09:33.406 --> 09:34.975
of their mind's potential?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.677
That much, huh?

09:36.777 --> 09:39.647
JACKIE: Last night I went
to this incredible seminar.

09:39.747 --> 09:42.650
What was it this time there,
Dare to be a Millionaire?

09:42.750 --> 09:45.385
See It and Be It.

09:45.485 --> 09:47.487
Be what?

09:47.587 --> 09:48.889
[creaking]

09:48.989 --> 09:50.290
[phone ringing]

09:51.158 --> 09:51.959
CRYSTAL: Hi, Jackie.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.193
Hey, Crystal.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.462
Roseanne, this guy,
Dr. Jerry Macklet,

09:55.562 --> 09:58.398
he teaches you how to tap
into the hidden treasures

09:58.498 --> 09:59.933
of your unconscious mind.

10:00.033 --> 10:00.834
He does, huh?

10:00.934 --> 10:01.835
Yeah, it's so simple.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.371
He goes, if your
mind can conceive it

10:04.471 --> 10:06.439
and your heart can believe
it, then you can achieve it.

10:06.539 --> 10:07.841
Achieve what?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.677
Oh, sis here went to another
one of her incredible seminars.

10:09.777 --> 10:10.911
- Oh.
- It was great.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.212
It's great.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.747
Maybe I should go with you
to one of these seminars.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.116
See It and Be It, that's the
one you should go to, Crystal.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.885
This will change your life.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.486
I'd love to change my life.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.688
JACKIE: Well, you can.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.791
For only $30, it's
a one-night course.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.259
What you get are the
basics of visualization.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.394
Visualization?

10:27.494 --> 10:28.796
JACKIE: Yeah, you use
your mind's potential

10:28.896 --> 10:30.563
to get anything you want.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.499
Like, if you want a brand new
car, well, all you gotta do

10:32.599 --> 10:33.366
is visualize it.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.935
Well, that sounds easy enough.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.837
Well, maybe you're on
to something here, sis.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.171
Yeah, you get outta here.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.072
[laughs]

10:39.172 --> 10:40.440
I'm serious.

10:40.540 --> 10:47.114
I'm visualizing a clean house
and kids who don't talk back

10:47.214 --> 10:49.516
and a husband who waits
on me hand and foot.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.884
You can you have that.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.219
Yeah, and we're--
we're all getting

10:52.319 --> 10:53.553
in Crystal's brand new car.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.191
And we're driving up
this beautiful mountain

10:58.291 --> 10:59.492
road to go to the countryside--

10:59.592 --> 11:00.493
JACKIE: That's the idea.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.429
--to visit my sister
in the nut barn.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.107
Hi.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.776
Are you the history teacher?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.544
Yes, I'm Ms. Crane.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.445
Hi.

11:18.545 --> 11:19.579
I'm Darlene's mom.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.181
Oh, I'd given up on you.

11:21.281 --> 11:22.916
You're 15 minutes late.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.817
I'm really sorry.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.452
I got here as soon as I could.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.554
I don't think we
can do this today.

11:27.654 --> 11:28.455
What?

11:28.555 --> 11:29.790
I have another engagement.

11:29.890 --> 11:30.690
What?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.392
You're gonna go play tennis?

11:32.492 --> 11:34.828
Squash.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.229
Could we do this another day?

11:36.329 --> 11:37.130
No.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.903
I had to get out from work
and hour early and lose pay.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.171
Then I got caught in traffic.
And I'm sorry.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.072
MISS CRANE: All right,
all right, all right.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.506
We'll do it today.
Have a seat.

11:59.052 --> 12:04.024
Darlene has been demonstrating
behavioral problems.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.793
What does that mean?

12:05.893 --> 12:09.897
She's been barking in class.

12:09.997 --> 12:10.964
Barking?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.665
Like a dog.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.401
Well, did you
tell her to stop it?

12:14.501 --> 12:15.702
I did.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.104
Did she stop it?

12:17.204 --> 12:18.271
She stopped.

12:18.371 --> 12:19.172
What's the problem?

12:22.042 --> 12:25.278
I feel this barking is
an aggressive manifestation

12:25.378 --> 12:26.513
of a deeper internal problem.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.955
Huh?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.790
Now let me explain.

12:36.890 --> 12:39.359
We have found that when
behavioral problems

12:39.459 --> 12:41.995
arise in the
classroom, it usually

12:42.095 --> 12:44.231
indicates a problem at home.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.132
Uh-huh.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.039
How would you describe
your relationship

12:52.139 --> 12:53.506
with your daughter?

12:53.606 --> 12:55.075
Oh, I'd say it's typical.

12:55.175 --> 12:55.976
[chuckles]

12:56.076 --> 12:58.178
Typical, not special?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.747
Typical.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.750
Do you feel you spend enough
time with your daughter?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.385
You mean, like quality time?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.056
Yes.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.691
Do you spend any free
time with Darlene?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.894
Well, I have three
kids and I work,

13:13.994 --> 13:15.762
so I don't have any free time.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.065
Oh, see, now that
may be the problem.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.300
Mhm.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.303
Well, I think the problem
is that there is no problem.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.138
Your daughter barks.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.874
Our whole family barks.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.549
Come here, you.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.684
DARLENE: What?

13:37.784 --> 13:40.954
Well, I talked to your
history teacher today.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.789
Oh, Miss Crane, the pain?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.425
Yeah, you're a real
jokester, all right.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.393
[cartoon sounds on tv]

13:46.493 --> 13:47.827
Turn that down.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.602
She says you've been
barking in class.

13:55.702 --> 13:58.305
Yeah.

13:58.405 --> 14:02.309
Well, what do you
wanna do that for?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.511
Mom, she is so boring.

14:04.611 --> 14:05.812
If I don't bark,
I'll fall asleep.

14:05.913 --> 14:06.713
[door slams]

14:06.813 --> 14:08.048
Mom!

14:08.148 --> 14:09.049
Mom, did you get my bookbag?

14:09.149 --> 14:09.950
Yeah, it's over there.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.118
OK, thanks.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.219
Well, I mean it, Darlene.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.320
You need to knock it off.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.388
And I'm serious,
no more barking.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.857
But everyone makes
fun of Miss Crane.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.292
Mom, this is blue.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.660
Hey, I'm talking to Mom.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.594
Well, so am I.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.495
Shut up.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.164
Don't tell me to shut up.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.498
You are so immature.
- [yelling]

14:25.598 --> 14:26.666
When are you
ever gonna grow up?

14:26.766 --> 14:27.567
Stop it, you two.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.637
Knock it off.

14:30.737 --> 14:34.975
You're gonna use that
bag until you're 30.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.076
Oh, great.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.844
I'm just gonna look like
a freak, that's all.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.047
- What else is new?
- Shut up.

14:40.147 --> 14:40.948
[sighs]

14:42.115 --> 14:43.483
This is why some
animals eat their young.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.960
Now, look, I want you to
take all of your stuff

14:53.060 --> 14:54.727
up to your room right now.

14:54.827 --> 14:55.628
Hi, babe.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.529
Hi.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.368
Dad, I struck out
Mark Winstead six times.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.103
Yeah, I saw that
in the sports page.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.304
Dad.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.474
It said something about
him being your boyfriend.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.375
[gasps]

15:08.475 --> 15:09.876
He is not my boyfriend.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.812
Well, you always strike
out the one you love,

15:12.912 --> 15:14.514
Mrs. Winstead.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.848
He is not my boyfriend.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.017
I can't stand him.

15:17.117 --> 15:17.985
DAN: (SINGING) K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.819
Be quiet.

15:19.919 --> 15:20.720
Be quiet!

15:20.820 --> 15:21.621
First comes love.

15:21.721 --> 15:22.922
Then comes marriage.

15:23.023 --> 15:23.957
Did you get any beer?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.692
It's on the counter.

15:25.792 --> 15:26.593
Thanks, honey.

15:26.693 --> 15:28.028
You're a peach.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.231
(SINGING) Then comes
Marky in a baby carriage.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.233
Hey, this is warm.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.601
That's all right.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.340
Dan?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.774
Yes?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.743
How come that sink
ain't fixed yet?

15:43.843 --> 15:45.012
Oh, I'm gonna get right on it.

15:45.112 --> 15:50.117
Aw, check this out, a genuine
hand-carved figurehead.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.055
Uh-huh, yeah.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.190
When I get the boat
finished, I'm gonna slap

15:57.290 --> 15:58.691
this baby right on the front.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.792
Oh, you are, huh?

15:59.892 --> 16:00.994
Yeah, ain't it a beaut?

16:01.094 --> 16:05.132
I can't believe Dwight
was gonna throw this out.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.533
What were you doing
over at Dwight's?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.935
Me and Freddy went over there
to help him work on his truck.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.870
But I thought you said you
were gonna start a job today.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.672
[sighs]
Well, I didn't get it.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.807
Somebody put in a lower bid.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.344
So you had like
the whole day off?

16:17.444 --> 16:19.646
No, I didn't have
the whole day off.

16:19.746 --> 16:23.350
I was busy making contacts.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.788
With what, Dwight's
truck and a six-pack?

16:28.888 --> 16:30.123
Ah, come on, Roseanne.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.160
Oh, come on, Dan.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.028
I was hoping he'd kick
a little work my way.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.929
I got my last two
jobs from Dwight.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.299
Well, maybe he can
get you your next wife.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.434
- Maybe.
- Ooh!

16:41.534 --> 16:43.436
Well, what would I
ever do without you?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.372
You just sit there and
drink your beer, hubby.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.040
I'll fix the sink myself.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.141
The hell you will.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.043
I'll fix the sink, Roseanne.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.145
Oh, talk is cheap, Mr. Fixit.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.913
Fixing a sink is
a husband's job.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.182
I am the husband.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.016
Yeah, and I'm the
wife, so it's my job

16:57.117 --> 16:58.285
to do everything else, right?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.352
Oh, don't give me that.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.554
Oh, well, it must be true.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.156
I put in eight hours
a day at the factory,

17:03.256 --> 17:06.193
and then I come home and
put in another eight hours.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.295
I am running around like a
maniac, taking back school--

17:08.395 --> 17:09.229
Mom, where's the tape?

17:09.329 --> 17:10.797
In the bathroom,
third drawer--

17:10.897 --> 17:12.999
bookbags, talking to
teachers, and everything else.

17:13.100 --> 17:14.701
And you don't do nothing.

17:14.801 --> 17:15.768
Whoa!

17:15.868 --> 17:17.637
Hey, I do plenty around here.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.273
Like what?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.475
Clean the gutters.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.344
And?

17:24.444 --> 17:25.478
What's the point
here, Roseanne?

17:28.281 --> 17:30.783
There is no point, OK?

17:30.883 --> 17:31.684
No point!

17:37.224 --> 17:43.896
The point is you think this is
a magic kingdom where you just

17:43.996 --> 17:45.165
sit up here on your throne.

17:45.265 --> 17:46.065
Oh, yeah?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.467
Yeah.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.269
And you think everything gets
done by some wonderful wizard.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.404
Oh, poof, the laundry's folded.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.106
Poof, dinner's on the table.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.307
You want me to fix dinner?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.375
I'll fix dinner.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.210
I'm fixing dinner!

17:57.310 --> 18:01.080
Oh, but, honey, you just
fixed dinner three years ago.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.885
Think I can't cook?

18:05.985 --> 18:07.354
I can cook.
I'm cooking.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.088
ROSEANNE: Yeah, and I'll
spend the rest of the night

18:09.189 --> 18:10.290
washing up the dishes.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.591
Hey, I do the dishes.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.525
When?

18:12.625 --> 18:15.528
Thursday, 6:45 PM.

18:15.628 --> 18:20.333
1970 what?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.603
Oh, we can't have a big
can of corn for dinner.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.874
I'll do it.

18:27.974 --> 18:28.941
Oh, let me do it.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.076
It's easier.

18:30.177 --> 18:32.379
See, I try to help.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.381
Well, you better try
a little bit harder.

18:34.481 --> 18:35.582
You know why?

18:35.682 --> 18:38.117
You better come down
off of your throne

18:38.218 --> 18:39.886
right now and start
helping me out around here

18:39.986 --> 18:41.288
because I'm getting fed up.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.022
DAN: Yeah, well, I got a
royal news flash for you.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.424
DARLENE: Ow!
BECKY: Dad!

18:44.524 --> 18:45.392
Mom, Dad!

18:45.492 --> 18:46.293
DARLENE: Ow.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.360
Darlene cut her finger off.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.428
ROSEANNE: What happened?

18:48.528 --> 18:49.996
BECKY: She cut herself
with the scissors.

18:50.096 --> 18:50.763
Ow.
DAN: Let's see.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.265
DARLENE: Ow.
- Oh, OK.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.132
Come on.
Let's go.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.033
Ow.

18:54.133 --> 18:54.934
[groans]

18:55.034 --> 18:56.769
Take her to the
emergency room.

18:56.869 --> 18:57.870
She needs a tourniquet.

18:57.970 --> 18:58.771
DARLENE: Ow.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.807
Shut up, honey.

19:00.907 --> 19:03.643
I'm just gonna rinse
this off first, OK?

19:03.743 --> 19:04.544
Ow.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.445
It's OK.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.913
It's gonna be all right.
- Ow.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.148
OK, now we just gotta keep
your finger above your head.

19:09.249 --> 19:09.849
Ow.
But it hurts.

19:09.949 --> 19:10.950
Yeah, honey.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.519
Well, try not to think
about your finger.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.486
- Ow, ow.
- Think about something else.

19:13.586 --> 19:14.754
- I can't.
- Yeah, you can.

19:14.854 --> 19:15.955
Think about--
- Ow.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.290
- --a flower.
- A flower?

19:17.390 --> 19:18.358
- Yeah.
- Ow.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.092
Close your eyes.
Go ahead, close them.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.194
Ow, ow, ow.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.029
OK, now think about
a real pretty flower.

19:23.129 --> 19:23.996
Ow.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.332
It's out in the
middle of the field.

19:25.432 --> 19:26.266
Ow.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.400
DAN: And the sun's
shining on it.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.868
Ow.
DAN: Can you see it?

19:28.968 --> 19:30.370
No.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.938
OK, forget about the flower.

19:32.038 --> 19:33.139
Think about the
demolition derby.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.040
Ow.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.408
What about it?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.478
Well, remember how that yellow
station wagon got clobbered?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.913
Yeah, that was neat.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.415
And then two
guys sandwiched him

19:42.515 --> 19:44.284
and slammed him into a wall.

19:44.384 --> 19:45.385
Yeah.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.920
DAN: And then Ricky
Tornado come full speed

19:48.020 --> 19:51.291
and tore the guy's rear end
off and flipped him over.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.527
Yeah, that was a blast.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.062
OK, bub, you're all finished.

19:56.162 --> 19:56.963
I am?

19:57.063 --> 19:57.864
Yep.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.866
Huh, I didn't even feel it.

19:59.966 --> 20:00.767
Pretty cool, huh?

20:00.867 --> 20:01.668
Yeah, thanks.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.046
Are you hungry?

20:14.146 --> 20:14.981
Not really.

20:15.081 --> 20:16.148
Great, I'll fix dinner.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.049
Great.

20:37.870 --> 20:38.671
Here you go.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.873
Oh, thanks, babe.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.509
Thank you.

20:42.609 --> 20:43.510
Honey, feel that board.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.211
You won't believe
how smooth it is.

20:45.312 --> 20:46.846
Yeah, run your hand along it.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.247
It feels good, huh?

20:48.348 --> 20:50.182
Yeah, I'm trembling
with excitement.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.788
Just think, when
you and I are retired,

20:55.888 --> 20:58.758
we're gonna be cruising
the Caribbean on this baby.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.192
I'm not getting on this thing.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.228
It'll be great.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.663
We'll spend our
last years together

21:03.763 --> 21:05.465
sailing through paradise.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.200
Oh, this sailor stuff
really turns you on, huh?

21:08.301 --> 21:09.101
DAN: Absolutely.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.370
[laughs]

21:10.470 --> 21:12.238
You know, there's nothing
more romantic than drifting

21:12.339 --> 21:13.172
on the open sea.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.073
Yeah?

21:14.173 --> 21:15.575
Yeah.

21:15.675 --> 21:20.480
Be all alone together every
night, cuddle up in bed,

21:20.580 --> 21:24.183
moonlight dancing on the water.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.553
Every night will be
a voyage to ecstasy.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.124
You're turning me on.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.092
I am?

21:33.192 --> 21:35.862
Yeah, let's do it.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.697
What about the sink?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.032
Anywhere you want.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.134

21:55.748 --> 21:58.718
