00:05.771 --> 00:09.541
On this dead files special investigation...

00:09.542 --> 00:13.635
Amy and I are investigating the
famous Lizzie Borden house.

00:13.636 --> 00:16.103
This is different for me.

00:16.104 --> 00:17.472
I don't like this.

00:17.473 --> 00:20.498
Usually, I don't know anything about
a location before I get there.

00:20.499 --> 00:23.536
This would be where the father died.

00:23.537 --> 00:25.871
No one knows what really
went down inside that house.

00:25.872 --> 00:28.901
Uh, fighting, really pounding on her.

00:28.902 --> 00:31.722
Just really nasty.

00:31.811 --> 00:36.181
And a hundred years later, this house
still haunts people that visit here.

00:36.182 --> 00:37.787
I don't know what I'm dealing with.

00:37.788 --> 00:41.988
I saw this black mass. I was scared.

00:45.424 --> 00:47.359
There's something down there.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.480
My name is Amy Allan.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.432
A lot of dead people are here.

00:53.433 --> 00:54.633
I see dead people.

00:54.634 --> 00:56.268
This is not good.

00:56.269 --> 00:58.437
I speak to dead people...

00:58.438 --> 01:00.305
He is very pissed off.

01:00.306 --> 01:01.540
And they speak to me...

01:01.541 --> 01:03.108
The house is angry.

01:03.109 --> 01:06.111
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

01:06.112 --> 01:08.480
He's killed people.

01:08.481 --> 01:09.682
I rely on my partner.

01:09.683 --> 01:13.118
I'm Steve Dischiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

01:13.119 --> 01:14.687
He got shot at his house?

01:14.688 --> 01:17.590
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:17.591 --> 01:19.157
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:19.158 --> 01:20.472
It's my job to reveal them.

01:20.473 --> 01:22.527
That sounds like something
out of The Exorcist.

01:22.528 --> 01:24.556
But Steve and I never speak...

01:24.557 --> 01:26.599
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:26.600 --> 01:27.933
Until the very end...

01:27.934 --> 01:29.267
It's bad.

01:29.268 --> 01:31.336
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:31.337 --> 01:32.771
I'd like some answers.

01:32.772 --> 01:35.772
Or time to get out.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074

02:06.905 --> 02:09.788
Steve and I conduct our
investigations separately.

02:09.789 --> 02:14.300
And we never know about each other's
findings until the very end.

02:14.301 --> 02:17.771
It's his job to find out about
the history of the locations.

02:17.772 --> 02:21.241
And to interview witnesses to
see if there's any connections,

02:21.242 --> 02:25.562
between his findings and my experiences.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.051
I'm headed to Fall River, Massachusetts.

02:28.052 --> 02:31.596
A small town that was known for something
that happened over a hundred years ago.

02:31.597 --> 02:37.056
This place is where Lizzie Borden was
accused of killing her parents with an axe.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.692
I'm meeting with a woman
named Lee-Ann Wilbur.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.095
She bought the Borden house,
where the murders took place,

02:42.096 --> 02:44.437
and turned into a bed and breakfast.

02:44.438 --> 02:48.268
Now Lee-Ann and her guests are seeing
and hearing things they can't explain.

02:48.269 --> 02:53.138
We're here to see if we can
figure out what's going on.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.507
I'm kind of worried.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.647
It's so old, and people have
been running through it

02:58.648 --> 03:01.781
and mucking around in there for...

03:01.782 --> 03:03.716
A long time.

03:03.717 --> 03:09.617
Before I enter a location, I place
myself into a meditative state.

03:10.124 --> 03:13.664
It allows me to have a clear...

03:13.665 --> 03:17.865
And complete connection with the dead.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.542
Even though the story of
Lizzie Borden is famous,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.770
most people have no idea
what Lizzie looks like.

03:31.771 --> 03:32.953
Neither does Amy.

03:32.954 --> 03:36.993
So just like any other location,
it's important that I remove,

03:36.994 --> 03:42.894
or hide any old photographs that
may influence Amy during her walk.

04:12.551 --> 04:16.391
<i>♪ Lizzie Borden took an axe...</i>

04:16.519 --> 04:20.360
<i>♪ Gave her mother 40 whacks...</i>

04:32.405 --> 04:35.628
She tries to make them go crazy.

04:35.629 --> 04:40.000
She just is, like, wants
to just be around...

04:40.001 --> 04:42.821
And make us nuts.

04:44.184 --> 04:47.553
Can she cause people to see things here?

04:47.554 --> 04:49.389
What sort of things?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.910
Hallucinations.

04:54.660 --> 04:58.264
I mean, she's very disturbed.

04:58.265 --> 05:02.045
Really, really, really disturbed.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.882
My head hurts.

05:05.371 --> 05:09.271
She's crawling through the walls.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.874
So this is the famous Lizzie Borden house.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.275
Yes, it is.

05:47.332 --> 05:50.383
So, Lee-Ann, what kind of
experiences have you had here?

05:50.384 --> 05:53.144
Let me show you.

06:01.069 --> 06:05.664
Well, this bedroom is
where I used to sleep.

06:05.665 --> 06:10.100
I had come up to bed one evening,
and I come up the stairs.

06:10.101 --> 06:14.847
I come into the room, and as
soon as I hit the doorway...

06:14.848 --> 06:17.877
It felt like, um, sickness.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.265
It just... very, very hard to breathe.

06:21.266 --> 06:23.490
As soon as I lay down, it
felt like somebody sat...

06:23.491 --> 06:29.391
The pressure increased. It felt
like somebody was sitting on me.

06:42.468 --> 06:45.038
Mm, this person...

06:45.039 --> 06:47.259
Is crazy.

06:47.624 --> 06:50.204
Mental, mental.

06:52.245 --> 06:57.585
- This is a woman?
- Yeah. Mm hmm, this is a woman.

06:59.353 --> 07:02.155
- What's wrong?
- I don't like it in here.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.989
Why?

07:03.990 --> 07:06.059
Um, because...

07:06.060 --> 07:08.940
I'm being touched.

07:10.196 --> 07:14.633
And that she's over. She's,
like, seeping out of the...

07:14.634 --> 07:16.734
Ceiling.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.972
She makes me sick.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.613
Physically sick.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.924
Why does she?

07:26.925 --> 07:30.285
I think it's her energy.

07:30.559 --> 07:33.809
Because her energy is... crazy energy.

07:33.810 --> 07:34.945
Okay.

07:34.946 --> 07:40.106
So it's, like, really hyper...
and, like, intense.

07:41.527 --> 07:44.467
I hate it in here.

07:53.272 --> 07:58.467
And this is the room where
Mrs. Borden's body was discovered.

07:58.468 --> 08:01.782
She had come up here to tidy up the room.

08:01.783 --> 08:07.683
She was up here making up the bed when
her attacker came in and murdered her.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.450
What a strange, strange, strange...

08:14.724 --> 08:17.364
Place, this is.

08:19.824 --> 08:21.967
Oh, God.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.869
I don't like that crazy lady.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.538
What's wrong?

08:25.539 --> 08:27.999
Uh, she's...

08:29.042 --> 08:31.361
I don't know. I feel scared of her.

08:31.362 --> 08:32.647
- Why?
- I don't know.

08:32.648 --> 08:34.820
- What's she gonna...
- Because she's [Bleep] crazy.

08:34.821 --> 08:37.416
Well, what could she do?

08:37.417 --> 08:41.437
What do you need to be scared of?

08:41.486 --> 08:44.667
Her emotions make me...

08:44.724 --> 08:47.544
Feel funny inside.

08:54.634 --> 09:00.534
And, like, I feel like she knows
I'm here now or something.

09:01.708 --> 09:04.228
I feel weird.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.460
Like she growls. She's, like, growling.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.557
Right now?

09:10.558 --> 09:13.449
Uh-huh. Like, she's like,
over there, and I...

09:13.450 --> 09:17.089
But I hear here and so, like, she's
like, breathing and growling.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.392
She's like...

09:19.393 --> 09:21.260
Like that. Like...

09:21.261 --> 09:23.421
Drooling.

09:27.567 --> 09:33.206
And it was also in this room that I had my
most disturbing experience in the house.

09:33.207 --> 09:37.042
I was up here one morning,
also making up the bed,

09:37.043 --> 09:42.943
and as I leaned over the end of the bed
here, it got very hard for me to breathe.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.322
The feeling I had when I pushed myself
up was it felt like somebody...

09:49.323 --> 09:51.857
Hit me in the chest.

09:51.858 --> 09:54.227
It was hard enough to knock
the breath out of me,

09:54.228 --> 09:57.230
and I started falling to the floor.

09:57.231 --> 10:01.334
And as soon as I did, I was just...
I was crying.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.721
I was sobbing before I even hit the floor.

10:03.722 --> 10:09.422
And my... the feeling I had was
just overwhelming sadness.

10:10.643 --> 10:15.971
Just so much of it, I was...
I was crying uncontrollably.

10:15.972 --> 10:17.870
Almost paralyzed.

10:17.871 --> 10:22.054
I stayed there for a few minutes before
crawling out of the room to the telephone

10:22.055 --> 10:25.130
and calling one of my employees
to come in and help me.

10:25.131 --> 10:28.294
I mean, I think that would've scared the
hell out of me if that happened to me.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.029
I left abruptly. I slept in my car.

10:31.030 --> 10:36.490
I didn't come back into the
house till the next day.

10:47.079 --> 10:50.683
What'd you wanna show me down here?

10:50.684 --> 10:54.587
Well, this past August, I had
an investigative group here.

10:54.588 --> 10:58.157
They left abruptly, around
2:30 in the morning.

10:58.158 --> 11:02.442
And they left out through the
bulkhead here, through the basement.

11:02.443 --> 11:08.343
After they left, I came into the house,
shut the house down, I went to bed.

11:08.502 --> 11:12.437
The next morning, around
11:00 A.M., I came out.

11:12.438 --> 11:17.898
I passed the bulkhead door,
and this is what I found.

11:19.877 --> 11:23.957
- Are those flies?
- Yes, they are.

11:50.960 --> 11:55.479
- That's a lot of flies.
- There were hundreds of them.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.398
So, Lee-Ann, did this ever happen before?

11:57.399 --> 11:58.419
No.

11:58.420 --> 12:01.384
- Was there anything dead?
- No, not at all.

12:01.385 --> 12:05.055
- And it was just in this one spot?
- Exactly in this one spot.

12:05.056 --> 12:08.121
- Did they ever come back?
- No, they did not.

12:08.122 --> 12:10.215
And there's no explanation
that you can think of?

12:10.216 --> 12:13.936
Nothing we could come up with.

12:32.036 --> 12:35.876
Oh, so this would be the couch.

12:36.742 --> 12:38.109
Or...

12:38.110 --> 12:43.750
One that, I guess, looks like
it, where the father died.

12:50.589 --> 12:56.489
We are standing in the sitting room,
where Mr. Borden was actually found.

12:58.129 --> 13:02.467
His body was found here on the
morning of August 4th, 1892.

13:02.468 --> 13:08.368
He had been hit ten times to the face
with what was believed to be a hatchet.

13:10.108 --> 13:12.210
Lee-Ann, how can Amy and I help you?

13:12.211 --> 13:14.333
Well, I don't know what I'm dealing with.

13:14.334 --> 13:18.016
I'm hoping that the two of you can
help bring some understanding

13:18.017 --> 13:21.052
to some of the events that have
happened over the last few years

13:21.053 --> 13:24.893
to both my staff and my guests.

13:28.745 --> 13:30.796
I need to move this couch.

13:30.797 --> 13:34.132
How? Like, away from the wall?

13:34.133 --> 13:37.073
- That way.
- Okay.

13:38.436 --> 13:42.156
Mm. Don't wanna tear anything.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.396
Oh.

13:57.155 --> 14:01.115
There's a Ouija Board under here.

14:01.318 --> 14:04.078
That's not good.

14:06.832 --> 14:10.985
Occasionally, I'll see Ouija
Boards at people's homes,

14:10.986 --> 14:13.805
and I get a little concerned.

14:13.806 --> 14:19.146
Because I think that it can
open doors to the dead.

14:20.118 --> 14:26.018
When I came across this Ouija
Board, it had a very strong vibe.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.757
Why did you want to move the sofa?

14:32.758 --> 14:34.158
Um...

14:34.159 --> 14:37.579
The area was bothering me.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.988
Lee-Ann bought this place to attract
people with morbid curiosities.

14:45.989 --> 14:47.898
But I think she got more
than she bargained for,

14:47.899 --> 14:51.643
because a lot of her guests are
terrified by their experiences.

14:51.644 --> 14:55.046
Robin and her niece Miranda
are just two of them.

14:55.047 --> 14:56.382
So, Robin, what happened?

14:56.383 --> 14:59.985
We decided to spend the night. We
stood up to about 12:00, 1:00.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.567
We saw shadows a few times.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.755
Tall shadow.

15:03.756 --> 15:05.762
It actually goes into The Master Bedroom,

15:05.763 --> 15:09.113
and once it gets over the
threshold, I no longer see it.

15:09.114 --> 15:12.196
- Which had startled me.
- How'd you feel?

15:12.197 --> 15:18.097
I was just kind of shocked because I
didn't know what was gonna happen.

15:28.943 --> 15:30.691
Do you see anybody?

15:30.692 --> 15:33.212
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

15:34.238 --> 15:37.051
Well, there's a man there who's...

15:37.052 --> 15:40.112
Can you describe him?

15:40.746 --> 15:44.226
Well, he looks pretty tall.

15:49.761 --> 15:53.374
I don't think he likes women very much.

15:53.375 --> 15:55.775
Not at all.

15:56.126 --> 15:59.461
What kind of a figure was it? Did it
look like something in particular?

15:59.462 --> 16:03.914
Actually the shape of a person,
but it was a tall shadow.

16:03.915 --> 16:06.038
Let me ask you this. Would
you stay here by yourself?

16:06.039 --> 16:07.839
No.

16:39.769 --> 16:43.849
Lot of fighting. A lot of fighting.

16:44.638 --> 16:46.914
- Who's fighting?
- Man.

16:46.915 --> 16:51.647
Like, I wish I could say,
like, how much stress...

16:51.648 --> 16:52.891
I'm feeling right now.

16:52.892 --> 16:54.617
Like it's like...

16:54.618 --> 16:56.718
[Bleep].

16:59.567 --> 17:03.227
There's just a lot of, um...

17:04.026 --> 17:09.925
Fighting. Physical. Just, uh...
there's a male and a female, and...

17:14.303 --> 17:16.872
Lee-Ann's night manager
also had an experience.

17:16.873 --> 17:21.108
And apparently, it really freaked him out.

17:21.109 --> 17:23.244
Ben, thanks for meeting with me.

17:23.246 --> 17:24.914
So you had an experience here.

17:24.915 --> 17:27.382
- Yes.
- What room is this?

17:27.383 --> 17:29.251
This is The Master Bedroom.

17:29.252 --> 17:32.722
This is the room where Andrew and Abby
Borden slept when they lived here.

17:32.723 --> 17:34.531
Okay, so what happened?

17:34.532 --> 17:37.076
Well, I was sitting on the
bed, reading a magazine,

17:37.077 --> 17:42.977
and it was about 2:00 in the morning, and I
saw a shadow move across the door frame.

17:44.171 --> 17:47.898
And a couple minutes later,
I saw the same exact thing.

17:47.899 --> 17:51.555
And a few minutes later, I saw it again...

17:51.556 --> 17:53.460
This tall...

17:53.461 --> 17:55.505
Black mass...

17:55.506 --> 17:58.114
And it moved all the way across the wall.

17:58.115 --> 18:01.355
And it just disappeared.

18:02.417 --> 18:05.340
It felt like it was someone...

18:05.341 --> 18:08.590
Watching me, someone coming up here
to check out what was going on.

18:08.591 --> 18:13.562
And I just immediately got the
impression it was Mr. Borden.

18:13.563 --> 18:16.083
I was scared.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.107
The man smacking the woman.

18:20.108 --> 18:21.637
Man...

18:21.638 --> 18:23.706
Like [Bleep]. Like...

18:23.707 --> 18:25.808
And she's pretty small.

18:25.809 --> 18:28.569
He's pretty big.

18:28.853 --> 18:32.488
Like, you could just... you can
see, like, her whole face like...

18:32.489 --> 18:37.008
You know what I mean? Like, he smacked, and
you can just, like, feel, like, the...

18:37.009 --> 18:39.258
Like, I mean, really pounding on her.

18:39.259 --> 18:41.962
Like, pulling her hair. Like...

18:41.963 --> 18:44.274
Just really nasty.

18:44.275 --> 18:49.195
Like, just, like, beating
the crap out of her.

18:54.671 --> 18:57.011
Who is it?

18:58.484 --> 19:01.844
I think it's the father.

19:19.550 --> 19:22.139
Just really nasty.

19:22.140 --> 19:27.060
Like, just, like, beating
the crap out of her.

19:32.782 --> 19:35.122
Who is it?

19:36.286 --> 19:39.646
I think it's the father.

19:40.323 --> 19:43.139
Three witnesses have
seen tall, Dark Shadows.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.929
And Ben is convinced that it's Mr. Borden.

19:46.930 --> 19:50.814
I don't like chasing shadows.
That's all I've got right now.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.945
I need to find out more about Mr. Borden.

19:52.946 --> 19:55.170
Why somebody would take
a hatched to his head,

19:55.171 --> 19:57.173
and if it has any connection
to what's happening

19:57.174 --> 20:02.094
in this house more than
a hundred years later.

20:09.485 --> 20:12.087
I understand you know a lot
about the Borden family.

20:12.088 --> 20:14.223
What do you know about Mr. Borden?

20:14.224 --> 20:19.755
Mr. Borden was 5-foot-10. He
was a very thin, angular man.

20:19.756 --> 20:21.983
He was a creature of
habit and had a certain

20:21.984 --> 20:24.594
routine that he would do every day.

20:24.595 --> 20:27.263
And that was post office, bank.

20:27.264 --> 20:30.567
He was on the board of
several Mills and Banks.

20:30.568 --> 20:35.248
He was pretty ruthless. He was a tough nut.

20:43.279 --> 20:46.349
Um, I see, like, banking.

20:46.350 --> 20:50.790
I think he was into Banking and numbers.

20:51.033 --> 20:54.333
Like, him going to work.

20:54.658 --> 20:57.598
Banking and numbers.

20:59.313 --> 21:02.073
What's going on?

21:11.141 --> 21:14.681
Well, I'm hearing a female.

21:15.211 --> 21:18.031
And she's like...

21:20.844 --> 21:23.286
Stressed out. She's, like, tired.

21:23.287 --> 21:25.321
Like...

21:25.322 --> 21:27.757
Doesn't wanna...

21:27.758 --> 21:29.957
Deal with anything anymore.

21:29.958 --> 21:33.396
She's got dark hair. She's kind of petite.

21:33.397 --> 21:37.600
Uh, but she's got, like, a full build.
Like, a full... she's, like...

21:37.601 --> 21:39.534
Stocky, I guess?

21:39.535 --> 21:41.515
And...

21:41.905 --> 21:43.939
Her hair's all frazzled.

21:43.940 --> 21:49.100
Like, it's done up but
it's, like, all frazzled.

21:51.314 --> 21:54.088
Did Lizzie Borden do these murders?

21:54.089 --> 21:55.842
I think she did.

21:55.843 --> 21:57.632
Why do you think that?

21:57.633 --> 21:59.338
Money, and lots of it.

21:59.339 --> 22:01.456
It's easy to make a case for her guilt.

22:01.457 --> 22:05.717
Lizzie has no alibi for either murder.

22:16.694 --> 22:20.474
Again, like, a lot of beatings.

22:20.811 --> 22:23.571
Lots of beatings.

22:30.587 --> 22:32.988
Lots of beatings.

22:32.989 --> 22:36.626
There's, like, rape and rape.

22:36.627 --> 22:38.868
Uh... people being tied up.

22:38.869 --> 22:41.029
Tied up.

22:47.771 --> 22:50.531
There was incest.

23:13.985 --> 23:16.983
Historians and legal experts have
spent the last hundred years,

23:16.984 --> 23:18.629
trying to solve the Borden murders.

23:18.630 --> 23:21.328
And I don't expect to figure it out today.

23:21.329 --> 23:24.077
But if I can find out why
Mr. Borden was murdered.

23:24.078 --> 23:29.978
Maybe I can figure out why Lee-Ann's
staff thinks he's still at the house.

23:42.313 --> 23:44.817
This was obviously a major crime here.

23:44.818 --> 23:45.882
It was.

23:45.883 --> 23:50.722
At the time, do you know if, uh,
murder was common in the area?

23:50.723 --> 23:53.358
There certainly were murders in Fall River.

23:53.359 --> 23:57.107
Um, what was unusual about this was that,

23:57.108 --> 24:02.634
you had a prominent elderly gentleman
and his wife slaughtered in their home.

24:02.635 --> 24:06.070
And you had a daughter who was suspect.

24:06.071 --> 24:09.218
Did anyone try to come
after Mr. Borden before?

24:09.219 --> 24:11.960
Well, it's certainly possible
because someone got into the house

24:11.961 --> 24:14.100
shortly before the murders
and took some things,

24:14.101 --> 24:17.382
and Andrew Borden did have three
locks on the front door of his home.

24:17.383 --> 24:19.717
Okay, so there had been a
burglary at the house.

24:19.718 --> 24:21.578
Yes.

24:31.297 --> 24:34.057
There was incest.

24:35.570 --> 24:37.610
Incest.

24:37.745 --> 24:40.385
Crying, yelling.

24:44.265 --> 24:49.174
And, like, really bad,
like, harmful, hurtful...

24:49.175 --> 24:50.566
Painful...

24:50.567 --> 24:52.427
Sex.

24:53.130 --> 24:56.393
Really, really nasty stuff, really.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.094
It's disgusting.

25:05.197 --> 25:09.100
Everyone in this town has a
strong opinion about Mr. Borden.

25:09.101 --> 25:13.771
I need to do my own research about
his family and the murders.

25:13.772 --> 25:19.619
I also need to see if I can find
documentation on a rumor I once heard.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.309
It's well-known that in
1892, Mr. Borden and

25:22.310 --> 25:24.883
his wife were found in
their home, murdered.

25:24.884 --> 25:28.518
Their heads brutally
caved in with a hatchet.

25:28.519 --> 25:31.780
Lizzie became the key suspect.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.865
She went to trial.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.982
After 26 days, she was acquitted.

25:36.983 --> 25:40.340
Some say she got away with a double murder.

25:40.341 --> 25:42.081
I find what I've been looking for...

25:42.082 --> 25:44.861
A paper written by a psychologist in 1997,

25:44.862 --> 25:49.557
speculating that the Bordens'
murderer was sexually molested.

25:49.558 --> 25:52.999
And destroyed the eyes and faces
of those who victimized her.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.723
So they couldn't see the monster
she felt she had become.

25:56.724 --> 26:01.222
In other words, Lizzie killed her
father because her father molested her.

26:01.223 --> 26:03.773
That paper was published 15 years ago.

26:03.774 --> 26:06.092
So I'm headed to meet with an
expert on the criminal mind,

26:06.093 --> 26:10.353
to see what she has to say about it.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.959
Professor, thanks for meeting with me.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.508
I wanted to talk to you about why Lizzie
Borden may have killed her father.

26:20.509 --> 26:24.289
I have some crime scene photos.

26:29.923 --> 26:35.683
Now do you see the same rage
that I see in these photos?

26:36.288 --> 26:40.668
I don't see some guy coming in
to do a burglary and doing that.

26:40.669 --> 26:43.270
I've had experience with
sexual abuse cases,

26:43.271 --> 26:45.341
and I wanted to get your
professional opinion

26:45.342 --> 26:47.992
that that might've been
what as going on here.

26:47.993 --> 26:50.662
The thing with sexual abuse trauma...

26:50.663 --> 26:54.715
Is that, um, you're not gonna
have immediate reaction...

26:54.716 --> 26:56.883
To your perpetrator.

26:56.884 --> 27:00.759
You know, you're gonna sit with that,
and it's gonna boil and boil and boil.

27:00.760 --> 27:04.502
If her father were abusing her.

27:04.503 --> 27:08.197
That kind of reaction
would be quite normal.

27:08.198 --> 27:10.297
To just...

27:10.298 --> 27:13.008
Lash out in anger.

27:13.009 --> 27:17.029
And kill them in a very ugly way.

27:17.271 --> 27:22.791
Her father would... he'd be
a good suspect for incest.

27:49.022 --> 27:50.882
Mph.

27:51.638 --> 27:55.962
No. I kind of... I have another
thing that happened, in my head.

27:55.963 --> 27:57.898
Um, that...

27:57.899 --> 28:03.419
Uh, there's a lot of, like,
dirty, dirty sex in here.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.214
What is it?

28:12.215 --> 28:15.617
Well, I'm getting, like, sisters...

28:15.618 --> 28:19.578
Sisters that did... stuff together.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.881
- Okay.
- Sex.

28:23.882 --> 28:25.432
- To each other?
- Yeah.

28:25.433 --> 28:27.764
- To... okay.
- Yeah.

28:27.765 --> 28:33.045
So they're sisters and
they're having sex together.

28:35.581 --> 28:39.339
I need to find out if sexual abuse
came up as a defense during the trial.

28:39.340 --> 28:45.240
So I'm going to meet with the expert
on the Lizzie Borden court case.

28:50.171 --> 28:54.442
Let me ask you something. Were there any
other suspects in Mr. Borden's murder?

28:54.443 --> 28:56.200
Um, he had enemies.

28:56.201 --> 28:59.865
He was a... he was rather
ruthless in business.

28:59.866 --> 29:02.850
Anything come up about
possible sexual abuse?

29:02.851 --> 29:06.212
Was that ever brought up at trial?

29:06.213 --> 29:07.915
That's been a theory.

29:07.916 --> 29:10.766
But there was no sexual abuse introduced.

29:10.767 --> 29:13.194
Was there any other evidence
that wasn't brought up?

29:13.195 --> 29:16.975
A lot of evidence was excluded.

29:18.934 --> 29:23.961
One of the judges had been appointed
by Lizzie's lead defense counsel,

29:23.962 --> 29:26.623
who was the former
Governor of Massachusetts.

29:26.624 --> 29:28.984
- Which is a conflict of interest.
- Yeah.

29:28.985 --> 29:31.411
Frank, you're the foremost expert
on the Lizzie Borden trial.

29:31.412 --> 29:33.648
- So I gotta ask the question.
- Yes?

29:33.649 --> 29:36.373
Do you think Lizzie did these murders?

29:36.374 --> 29:40.392
Is there proof beyond a reasonable doubt?
I think... I think there is.

29:40.393 --> 29:46.293
- If this murder took place today...
- I think she'd have been convicted.

29:59.316 --> 30:02.083
She had kind of a large,

30:02.084 --> 30:05.319
round but square kind of face.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.240
Okay.

30:07.383 --> 30:09.726
She was a little...

30:09.727 --> 30:12.067
Um, stocky.

30:12.188 --> 30:17.168
She had almond-shaped
eyes, but they were wide.

30:17.226 --> 30:18.418
How old?

30:18.419 --> 30:21.599
Late 40s or early 50s.

30:24.732 --> 30:28.572
And she has, uh, thick eyebrows.

30:29.472 --> 30:31.572
Uh, her nose...

30:31.573 --> 30:33.727
Was kind of, like, thinner up here.

30:33.728 --> 30:35.301
Straight.

30:35.302 --> 30:40.162
Um, but then it kind of,
like, is full here.

30:45.853 --> 30:48.768
Does this look like her?

30:48.769 --> 30:52.189
Yeah, that looks like her.

31:28.319 --> 31:30.355
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigation,

31:30.356 --> 31:35.216
we finally get to hear
each other's findings.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.696
Well, it's good to see you guys again.

31:37.697 --> 31:41.062
Uh, Lee-Ann and Ben,
this is Amy, my partner.

31:41.063 --> 31:43.427
Lee-Ann owns the Lizzie Borden house.

31:43.428 --> 31:45.679
She runs it as a bed-and-breakfast.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.847
Uh, Ben's the night manager.

31:47.848 --> 31:53.748
Uh, and both of them have had
experiences that have freaked them out.

31:55.035 --> 32:00.935
Amy and I came in to do our investigation,
and the way we do it is independently.

32:02.136 --> 32:06.676
I do my investigation, as far as the
house goes and what I can find out.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.728
Amy does her walk.

32:08.729 --> 32:10.913
This is the first time we're
actually seeing each other

32:10.914 --> 32:13.929
and talking to each other since the
beginning of the investigation.

32:13.930 --> 32:18.430
So, Amy, what did you find on your walk?

32:19.679 --> 32:23.034
Well, when I was doing my walk.

32:23.035 --> 32:28.092
Uh, one of the things that
happened in the living area...

32:28.093 --> 32:33.433
Was my guides were yelling
at me to move the couch.

32:34.995 --> 32:38.835
- Do you wanna move it?
- Yeah.

32:41.545 --> 32:45.505
There's a Ouija Board under here.

32:47.140 --> 32:49.900
That's not good.

32:49.950 --> 32:52.646
My spirit guides will
lead me through my walks

32:52.647 --> 32:56.660
and give me information
when no one else will.

32:56.661 --> 33:00.854
And so all I hear is, move it!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

33:00.855 --> 33:05.655
And there was a Ouija
Board under the couch.

33:06.142 --> 33:10.620
This one has a problem. The
dead are tired of being...

33:10.621 --> 33:13.201
Contacted here.

33:13.367 --> 33:17.974
I would recommend you remove this
one simply because the dead,

33:17.975 --> 33:20.960
here are having issues with it.

33:20.961 --> 33:25.614
Sometimes when I'm doing my
evening hosting with the guests,

33:25.615 --> 33:28.059
I will take the Ouija Board and I will...

33:28.060 --> 33:30.940
Hide it from them.

33:31.520 --> 33:34.640
I'm not anti-Ouija...

33:34.780 --> 33:38.980
But, they're... they're tired of it.

33:43.498 --> 33:49.078
The next thing that I encountered
was, uh, a nasty man.

33:50.639 --> 33:52.607
Fighting, physical. Just, uh...

33:52.608 --> 33:55.914
There's a male and a female and... mm.

33:55.915 --> 33:58.213
You know, and he is pretty big.

33:58.214 --> 34:00.515
Just really nasty.

34:00.516 --> 34:05.436
Like, just, like, beating
the crap out of her.

34:06.409 --> 34:07.769
He was a tall man.

34:07.770 --> 34:11.860
He was very, very angry, and he
was stressed out about his home.

34:11.860 --> 34:17.761
He was stressed out about his work,
which involved numbers and banks.

34:17.768 --> 34:21.388
Honestly, just a miserable, miserable man.

34:21.389 --> 34:24.072
- Mm.
- And took it out on...

34:24.074 --> 34:26.992
Everyone around him.

34:26.993 --> 34:30.833
I think it was Lizzie's father.

34:32.847 --> 34:35.550
Ben, why don't you tell
Amy about your story?

34:35.551 --> 34:41.190
Um, upstairs on the second
floor in The Master Bedroom...

34:42.623 --> 34:45.349
I was sleeping one night, and...

34:45.350 --> 34:48.746
Three different times I saw this tall...

34:48.748 --> 34:51.003
Black shadow.

34:51.004 --> 34:54.899
And it moved all the way across that wall.

34:54.900 --> 34:56.715
It was clear as day.

34:56.716 --> 35:00.976
I got the immediate feeling that he...

35:01.107 --> 35:05.547
Was a man and he was very overbearing...

35:05.682 --> 35:11.262
I just immediately got the
impression it was Mr. Borden.

35:11.586 --> 35:13.647
I talked to Shelly, who's a historian,

35:13.648 --> 35:17.626
and she told me, uh,
Mr. Borden was a tall man.

35:17.627 --> 35:18.989
He was lanky.

35:18.990 --> 35:23.918
He got into investment properties and
he lent people money, like a bank.

35:23.919 --> 35:25.834
He did... did pretty well for himself.

35:25.835 --> 35:28.766
Was the shadow Ben saw Mr. Borden?

35:28.767 --> 35:30.336
What you saw...

35:30.337 --> 35:33.457
Could possibly be him.

35:33.515 --> 35:38.780
It could've been Mr. Borden that Ben
saw, but I think it was someone else...

35:38.781 --> 35:40.382
Or something else.

35:40.383 --> 35:43.439
And I don't think that Ben or Lee-Ann,

35:43.440 --> 35:46.980
are ready to hear that yet.

35:47.490 --> 35:53.390
So I then went into the kitchen, because
I heard two women talking in there.

35:53.745 --> 35:58.432
And when I went in there, I
actually saw one of the women.

35:58.433 --> 36:00.645
Her hair's all frazzled.

36:00.646 --> 36:04.286
Like, it's done up, but
it's, like, all frazzled.

36:04.287 --> 36:08.210
And, um, she doesn't want to
deal with anything anymore.

36:08.211 --> 36:13.179
Extreme stress, extreme panic,
and just really frazzled.

36:13.180 --> 36:15.342
- Now you did a sketch, right?
- Yeah, I did.

36:15.343 --> 36:17.263
Okay.

36:18.587 --> 36:20.689
Now this is the sketch from
the woman in the kitchen?

36:20.690 --> 36:22.550
Yes.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.725
It's...

36:28.726 --> 36:31.426
This is amazing.

37:06.002 --> 37:08.216
Now this is the sketch from
the woman in the kitchen?

37:08.217 --> 37:10.077
Yes.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.570
It's...

37:16.571 --> 37:19.271
This is amazing.

37:23.343 --> 37:26.655
Now during my investigation,
I was able to acquire,

37:26.656 --> 37:30.292
a very rare picture of Lizzie
Borden as an old woman.

37:30.293 --> 37:36.193
Uh, I want you guys to take a look
at this and tell me what you think.

37:43.957 --> 37:46.196
That's Lizzie Borden.

37:46.197 --> 37:50.569
What's going through your
head when you see it?

37:50.570 --> 37:52.280
It's unmistakable.

37:52.281 --> 37:53.751
Uncanny.

37:53.752 --> 37:57.652
Same features, frizz in the hair.

37:59.837 --> 38:01.749
Um...

38:01.750 --> 38:03.183
What do you got?

38:03.184 --> 38:07.744
This is where it gets a little disturbing.

38:11.659 --> 38:13.027
What is it?

38:13.028 --> 38:16.363
Well, I'm getting, like, sisters...

38:16.364 --> 38:20.000
Sisters that did... stuff together.

38:20.001 --> 38:21.577
- To each other?
- Yeah.

38:21.578 --> 38:24.194
- To... okay.
- Yeah.

38:24.195 --> 38:27.984
The second floor I did pick up on...

38:27.985 --> 38:30.025
Incest.

38:30.164 --> 38:32.898
But what I saw was...

38:32.899 --> 38:35.041
Two women.

38:35.042 --> 38:37.985
And I got that they were sisters.

38:37.986 --> 38:42.966
And that they were having
a sexual relationship.

38:43.519 --> 38:46.370
There was an older sister and
then the younger sister,

38:46.371 --> 38:49.462
and the older sister was
definitely the one who was...

38:49.463 --> 38:51.923
Orchestrating.

38:52.700 --> 38:54.234
It's weird.

38:54.235 --> 38:59.609
I do believe that Mr. Borden
sexually abused his daughters.

38:59.610 --> 39:05.359
And this is the way the girls learned how
to show love and affection to each other.

39:05.360 --> 39:10.388
The more you learn about things, it
brings you to a conclusion for a case.

39:10.389 --> 39:15.604
When both parents were murdered, the
older sister got the inheritance.

39:15.605 --> 39:19.026
But she split it with Lizzie,
which she didn't have to do.

39:19.027 --> 39:21.428
Now on top of that, she
pays out of her money,

39:21.429 --> 39:25.108
the 25 grand for the
defense team for Lizzie.

39:25.109 --> 39:27.563
Could this be the scenario?

39:27.564 --> 39:31.504
Mr. Borden abuses his daughters,
and the stepmother does nothing.

39:31.505 --> 39:34.925
Two sisters plan a murder.

39:35.584 --> 39:39.722
They split the money and
move on with their lives.

39:39.723 --> 39:42.858
- Is it possible?
- Oh, yes.

39:42.859 --> 39:47.293
I think there were a lot of bad
things that happened here.

39:47.294 --> 39:50.288
And she was a victim.

39:50.289 --> 39:53.529
As well as a murderess.

39:55.404 --> 39:58.836
There's something else that
I encountered on my walk.

39:58.837 --> 40:01.966
When I went upstairs on the second floor.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.057
What I saw was a woman...

40:05.058 --> 40:09.879
And she was completely insane, and
she was crawling on the walls,

40:09.880 --> 40:12.176
scratching on the walls.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.575
Mph. This person...

40:14.576 --> 40:16.612
Is crazy.

40:16.613 --> 40:21.065
And... but she's over there.
She's, like, seeping out of the...

40:21.066 --> 40:22.490
Ceiling.

40:22.491 --> 40:26.201
- Amy, do you know who this woman is?
- I believe it's Lizzie Borden.

40:26.202 --> 40:30.274
But it's just one aspect
of her personality that...

40:30.275 --> 40:33.596
Um, is kind of stuck in...

40:33.597 --> 40:37.342
The emotional and mental state...

40:37.343 --> 40:40.554
Of being potentially abused.

40:40.555 --> 40:42.672
Not processing it.

40:42.673 --> 40:48.253
Um, and it's all kind of
accumulated into this, that...

40:49.810 --> 40:54.670
This aspect of her, broke
off, like shattered.

40:54.836 --> 40:59.102
And is in a place where everything began.

40:59.103 --> 41:02.865
The part of Lizzie Borden that I
saw was like a split personality.

41:02.866 --> 41:05.431
It was the part of her that
committed the murders.

41:05.432 --> 41:07.785
The part of her that went crazy.

41:07.786 --> 41:10.938
And when she died that part of
her returned to this house,

41:10.939 --> 41:12.824
because of what she did here.

41:12.825 --> 41:14.727
So if Mr. Borden is residual,

41:14.728 --> 41:18.895
is this crazy piece of Lizzie what's
tormenting everybody in the house?

41:18.896 --> 41:20.756
Yes.

41:20.877 --> 41:23.927
This fractured piece of Lizzie
can manipulate emotions,

41:23.928 --> 41:26.831
just like I think it did to Lee-Ann.

41:26.832 --> 41:30.338
But I can tell by the look on Lee-Ann's
face that she doesn't believe me.

41:30.339 --> 41:34.147
But I know what I saw, and I don't
think this is going to stop,

41:34.148 --> 41:36.984
until everyone here
really wants it to stop.

41:36.985 --> 41:40.696
So how's this all sinking in? I
mean, kinda blew me away tonight.

41:40.697 --> 41:42.980
It's just a shock to hear that.

41:42.981 --> 41:46.335
Ben and I will defiantly be
discussing quite a few of...

41:46.336 --> 41:49.669
Uh, many of the thing you've
said, long after you've left.

41:49.670 --> 41:54.858
I hope the information we brought you
guys, helps kind of clear things up.

41:54.859 --> 41:59.703
I'm glad to know, what's going on.
You know?

41:59.704 --> 42:02.370
People who come and have issues later,

42:02.371 --> 42:05.962
feel free to contact me, and
I'll help, I'll help them out.

42:05.963 --> 42:10.183
Call her if things start going...
a little wacky here.

42:10.184 --> 42:14.630
If anything major happens I
will, I will uh, call for help.

42:14.631 --> 42:18.364
You know, thank you for that offer.
