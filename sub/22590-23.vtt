<i>NARRATOR".
Mount Ararat Hospital in Gotham City...</i>

00:12.597 --> 00:16.142
<i>...where King Tut's psychoanalysis
goes on and on.</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:22.440
The old adage about the apple not falling far
from the tree just ain't necessarily so.

00:22.607 --> 00:23.983
How?

00:24.150 --> 00:26.402
<i>Dr. Demon.</i>

00:27.278 --> 00:29.197
<i>Dr. Demon'?</i>

00:29.364 --> 00:30.698
Spunky?

00:32.366 --> 00:36.788
<i>Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop</i>

00:36.955 --> 00:39.290
<i>When the wind...</i>

00:39.457 --> 00:42.794
Dirty asp in the grass. He locked it.

00:43.294 --> 00:47.757
So I said to Daddy,
"But I'm too young to get married, Pa.

00:47.924 --> 00:50.051
I'm only 12 years old."

00:58.059 --> 01:01.938
You know, I always had a feeling
you never really listened to me.

01:03.815 --> 01:05.775
Con-- Continue.

01:07.485 --> 01:12.240
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, at the offices
of the Rosetta Stone Company...</i>

01:12.824 --> 01:14.826
Why me? Why me?

01:14.993 --> 01:16.828
Why not you?

01:16.995 --> 01:19.998
- That's logical.
-I'm nothing if not logical.

01:20.164 --> 01:24.002
Take only $47,000, Tutlings.

01:25.795 --> 01:27.964
But there's 76,000, poopsie.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.174
No need to be a pig about these things.

01:30.341 --> 01:32.677
We have the money,
almighty king of rogues.

01:32.844 --> 01:34.095
Master of Thebes.

01:34.262 --> 01:35.471
Ruler of darkness.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.140
Defender of Egypt.

01:37.307 --> 01:38.933
Don Juan of Aswân.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.894
- King of the Nile.
-Wait a minute. Take it back one.

01:42.061 --> 01:45.523
- Don Juan of Aswan?
-Yeah, I like that. Leave it in. Ha, ha.

01:46.858 --> 01:47.900
Yes?

01:48.067 --> 01:50.028
Oh, hello, Dr. Denton.

01:50.570 --> 01:51.821
What?

01:51.988 --> 01:54.032
King Tut?

01:54.616 --> 01:57.368
Yes. Yes, of course. I'll contact him at once.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.036
What a shame.

03:22.203 --> 03:26.165
At last report, our able Yale professor
was well on his way to recovery.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.001
Another six or seven months
of intensive analysis...

03:29.168 --> 03:31.671
...and he might have been completely cured.

03:32.130 --> 03:34.674
Ah, yes, but as John Greenleaf Whittier said:

03:34.841 --> 03:41.139
"For of all sad words of tongue or pen,
the saddest are these: 'It might have been."'

03:41.305 --> 03:43.349
"Maud Muller," stanza 53.

03:43.516 --> 03:47.103
Very good, Robin. I didn't know
you were a student of the classics.

03:47.270 --> 03:51.357
Batman teaches me a little poetry
in between remanding criminals to jail.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.735
Enough prose and cons, Robin.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.196
Now, where can we find Rosetta Stone?

03:57.363 --> 04:02.326
Resting comfortably at home:
328 Kangaroo Court.

04:04.537 --> 04:07.331
I trust a visit from us
wouldn't be too upsetting.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.542
She's expecting you, Batman.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.795
Ah, good. Let's go, Robin.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.048
Hi-ho.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.178
So you made up your mind, Daddy.
You'd really like to move to the suburbs.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.389
Heh. It might be a pleasant change
from my old brownstone.

04:23.556 --> 04:26.142
If I only had time to find a place. Oh, my.

04:26.309 --> 04:30.438
Well, if I get a chance today, I'll check
with a real estate broker or two for you, okay?

04:30.605 --> 04:31.647
Thank you, darling.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.941
- Bye, Daddy. Bye, Chief O'Hara.
-Bye-bye.

04:34.650 --> 04:38.654
<i>NARRATOR". Shortly, at Florence of Arabia's,
an intime boîte...</i>

04:38.821 --> 04:42.658
<i>...in the middle east side of Gotham City...</i>

04:46.579 --> 04:49.165
Ah, turkey legs.

04:49.332 --> 04:51.125
My favorite fruit.

04:51.292 --> 04:55.546
Florence, a little more pressed grape,
if you please.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.718
Oh, I'm sorry, poopsie.

05:00.885 --> 05:02.720
I guess I got a little carried away.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.639
No matter, Flo.

05:04.806 --> 05:09.393
Your assets far outnumber your liabilities.

05:09.811 --> 05:14.982
Oh, that this too, too solid flesh would melt.

05:15.149 --> 05:18.236
- Why don't you go on a diet, fatty?
-"Why don't you go on a diet?"

05:18.402 --> 05:20.988
Why don't you mind
your own skinny business?

05:21.614 --> 05:24.408
Now, being Egyptian...

05:24.575 --> 05:29.580
...naturally, I have a nose for Nilanium.

05:30.790 --> 05:35.086
Nilanium, the hardest metal in the world.

05:35.253 --> 05:37.672
It was once found only in the Nile Basin.

05:37.839 --> 05:43.761
But when that was flooded by the Aswân Dam,
this precious deposit was lost forever.

05:43.928 --> 05:46.931
So forever is something
you can't do much about, huh, poopsie?

05:47.098 --> 05:49.308
Wrong again, Florence.

05:49.475 --> 05:54.564
My nose for Nilanium tells me
that there is another invaluable deposit...

05:54.730 --> 05:56.858
...right here in Gotham City.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.484
Right where in Gotham City?

05:58.651 --> 06:04.282
Unfortunately, said reserves rest directly
under stately Wayne Manor.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.491
Wayne Manor?

06:05.658 --> 06:11.289
Ancestral home of millionaire Bruce Wayne
and his youthful ward, Dick Grayson.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.624
But you can't buy that for 47,000.

06:13.791 --> 06:18.170
But I can and will buy some land directly
adjacent to the estate for that exact sum.

06:18.504 --> 06:22.675
And once that's done, we'll start drilling
for my Nilanium and make a fortune.

06:23.009 --> 06:27.388
- How?
-By making the hardest objects in the world...

06:27.555 --> 06:29.432
...out of the hardest metal.

06:29.599 --> 06:34.729
Indestructible machines,
indestructible buildings.

06:34.896 --> 06:41.903
I'll build an indestructible empire
that no one will be able to destruct!

06:42.486 --> 06:46.032
But isn't that Nilanium really the property
of millionaire Bruce Wayne?

06:46.198 --> 06:49.660
Yeah, it would have to be under his property.
Money goes to money.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.329
But not this money.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.665
We're going to engage
in a bit of slant mining.

06:54.832 --> 06:56.250
Where to, almighty monarch?

06:56.417 --> 06:58.377
To the office of Manny the Mesopotamian...

06:58.544 --> 07:01.380
...an unscrupulous real estate broker
of my acquaintance...

07:01.547 --> 07:03.716
...and by merest circumstance...

07:03.883 --> 07:07.053
...the man who has the listing
on the property next to Wayne Manor.

07:09.013 --> 07:11.057
Forty-seven thousand dollars, sir?

07:11.223 --> 07:14.477
But isn't that rather an odd sum
for King Tut to take?

07:14.644 --> 07:15.686
Yes, it is, Alfred.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.899
Rosetta Stone told us
that Tut didn't wanna be a pig about it.

07:21.192 --> 07:22.985
Bacon.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.196
Pig.

07:25.488 --> 07:29.992
It's against Egyptian dietary laws to eat pig.

07:30.159 --> 07:35.748
Ergo, I think it was a ruse on his part
to obscure the truth.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.708
Well, what is the truth, Batman?

07:37.875 --> 07:44.465
Perhaps he intends buying something
that costs exactly $47,000.

07:44.632 --> 07:47.760
Let's see what the Batcomputer has to offer.

07:55.393 --> 07:58.479
- It seems a little uncertain, Batman.
-Certainly does.

07:59.355 --> 08:03.234
No wonder. "Northeast section
of millionaire Bruce Wayne's property."

08:03.401 --> 08:05.236
The Batcomputer said that?

08:05.403 --> 08:07.279
But that's only partly right, Alfred.

08:07.446 --> 08:13.077
I have put a 200-foot lot up for sale
on the edge of stately Wayne Manor estate...

08:13.244 --> 08:15.621
...to help alleviate the property shortage.

08:15.788 --> 08:18.124
- Jolly decent of you, sir.
- Yeah.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.210
But I gave the real estate broker
specific instructions...

08:21.377 --> 08:26.590
...to ask for a firm $48,000, not $47,000.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.634
This machine needs oiling.

08:36.017 --> 08:38.102
How much do you have to spend,
Ms. Gordon?

08:38.269 --> 08:40.604
Well, actually, it isn't me,
it's my father, Mr., uh...

08:40.770 --> 08:43.482
Just call me Manny. Everybody does.
That's my name, Manny.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.695
Well, my father is tired of city congestion
and thought he might make a good deal here.

08:47.862 --> 08:52.116
Well, frankly, Ms. Gordon, if I were your father,
I'd just forget about this area entirely.

08:52.283 --> 08:56.787
Why, this afternoon, I have a deal where
I'm selling a lot without a house for $47,000.

08:56.954 --> 09:00.207
- Is that the one? "Lot, $48,000 firm"?
-Yes.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.294
- I'm cutting my commission to make the deal.
-Is that legal?

09:03.461 --> 09:07.298
Well, legal, yes, ethical, no,
but nobody ever accused me of being ethical.

09:07.757 --> 09:10.634
Well, thank you very much.
I'll call my father.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.636
Good day, Ms. Gordon.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.812
Salaam yourself, Manny.
No time for pleasantries.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.023
- You have the contract?
-I have the contract.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.734
- You have the money?
-Give him the money.

09:28.611 --> 09:33.282
Thank you very much. Just sign right there.
That's it. Right there. That's right.

09:33.657 --> 09:35.451
- What? No middle initial?
-I never use it.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.412
Heh. That's what I like about you fellas.
No haggling.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.917
Hello, Mr. Wayne? This is Batgirl.

09:43.084 --> 09:44.794
Why, hello, Batgirl.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.879
To what do I owe this unexpected honor?

09:47.046 --> 09:49.924
I've discovered that King Tut
has purchased a plot of land...

09:50.091 --> 09:52.009
...adjacent to your property, Mr. Wayne.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.011
King Tut?

09:54.178 --> 09:56.847
Well, that should make
a very interesting neighborhood...

09:57.014 --> 09:59.767
...probably drive the real estate values
straight down.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.895
I'm sure he has some diabolical scheme
in mind.

10:03.062 --> 10:06.857
I thought you should be made aware of it.
I'm going to try and contact Batman now.

10:07.316 --> 10:12.863
I may be talking to him shortly myself, Batgirl.
Perhaps I can give him a message for you.

10:13.030 --> 10:16.408
Yes. Tell him I'll be in Commissioner Gordon's
office in half an hour.

10:16.575 --> 10:19.370
Perhaps we should meet
and plan a joint attack.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.872
Right. Thanks for the information.

10:23.374 --> 10:27.294
Of what possible use could that land be
to a man like Tut?

10:27.461 --> 10:30.840
Maybe he wants to just settle down
and build a house.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.467
No, I think not, Robin.
Tut doesn't impress me...

10:33.634 --> 10:38.264
...as the be-it-ever-so-humble-
there-is-no-place-like-home type of individual.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.979
What is it, Batman?

10:46.564 --> 10:50.025
A potpourri of news, Robin,
both good and bad.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.236
What's the good news?

10:52.778 --> 10:57.575
Stately Wayne Manor is sitting
on a priceless reserve of Nilanium.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.910
Holy hardest metal in the world.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.329
But what's the bad news?

11:02.496 --> 11:05.583
The special seismological attachment
to the Batcomputer...

11:05.749 --> 11:11.797
...has divined
that King Tut has started mining Nilanium...

11:11.964 --> 11:16.093
...and his mining operations are aimed--

11:16.260 --> 11:17.928
Is it possible?

11:18.095 --> 11:21.599
- His mining operations are aimed--
-Into what, Batman?

11:21.765 --> 11:24.101
Directly into the Batcave.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.574
It's no use, Robin.

11:38.741 --> 11:43.662
His shaft is more than halfway here
and should be entering the Batcave shortly.

11:44.455 --> 11:47.958
Isn't there anything we can do to divert them
so they'd miss the Batcave?

11:48.125 --> 11:52.463
The Batanium Shield lining the Batcave might
protect us from his blasting, but I doubt it.

11:52.630 --> 11:56.133
No, we'll have to go topside and nab him
before he strikes pay dirt.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.177
Nab him where?

11:58.344 --> 12:01.639
I suspect he may be operating
from an abandoned mine...

12:01.805 --> 12:04.016
...on that property he bought.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.314
Aren't we gonna take the Batmobile?

12:11.065 --> 12:12.900
It's too risky.

12:13.692 --> 12:18.113
There's so many people in the area, they might
spot us as we drive out the secret entrance.

12:18.280 --> 12:23.160
No, we'll use the subterranean blue grotto exit
after I make this call.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.003
Yes, Batman? Right.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.839
As we hoped, it's for you, Batgirl.

12:37.508 --> 12:38.676
Yes, Batman?

12:38.842 --> 12:42.554
There's a deserted mine entrance one mile
north-northeast of stately Wayne Manor.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.640
- Could you meet us there?
-Anything wrong?

12:44.807 --> 12:48.102
- Everything's wrong.
<i>- I'll</i> be there as soon as possible.

12:51.105 --> 12:52.898
What now, Batman?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.859
According to my Bat-compass...

12:56.026 --> 13:02.199
...north by northeast
is in a general north-northeasterly direction.

13:02.366 --> 13:05.035
Shouldn't take us more than three minutes
to run the mile.

13:05.202 --> 13:07.746
Gosh, Batman, that's a new world's record.

13:07.913 --> 13:11.792
Breaking world's records
is just part of crime-fighting, Robin.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.419
Now.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.214
<i>NARRATOR".
But will they be too late?</i>

13:17.381 --> 13:20.050
<i>For at this very moment...</i>

13:20.217 --> 13:25.306
<i>...outside the abandoned cave
from which Tut is operating...</i>

13:25.472 --> 13:28.183
How much longer do you think it'll take,
royal geologist?

13:28.350 --> 13:29.393
Well--

13:29.560 --> 13:33.147
How come he gets to be royal haggler
and royal tailor and royal geologist too?

13:33.314 --> 13:36.066
We're working on a close budget,
royal boobula.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.568
When we strike Nilanium...

13:37.735 --> 13:41.405
...I'll have enough scratch
to hire a complete royal entourage.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.449
We should be there right about now.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.912
Oh. Here comes H.L. Hunter,
the royal mining foreman.

13:49.079 --> 13:52.458
What ho, H.L.? Strike anything?

13:52.624 --> 13:55.753
You know, we done struck something,
but it weren't no Nilanium.

13:55.919 --> 13:58.380
- I think we done struck trouble.
-Why?

13:58.547 --> 14:02.092
Well, it seems that there's a big cave
directly beneath Wayne Manor.

14:03.093 --> 14:06.430
It's lined with some hard substance,
so we can't blast through it.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.141
Perhaps we've struck a vein of Nilanium.

14:09.308 --> 14:11.769
But it shouldn't be that hard till it's refined.

14:11.935 --> 14:15.898
- Do you have any more dynamite?
-Sure, but we got no one to blast it.

14:16.065 --> 14:18.108
None of my men wanna take the chance.

14:18.275 --> 14:19.651
It's sort of dangerous.

14:21.779 --> 14:23.030
I'll do it.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.616
Danger is my middle name.

14:25.783 --> 14:27.576
Show me the way.

14:27.743 --> 14:28.994
You aren't going anywhere, Tut.

14:29.161 --> 14:32.289
Ah, look who's here, the Dynamic Dullards.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.582
Plus one.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.459
Oh, and the Dynamic Duenna.

14:35.626 --> 14:40.297
Instruct your royal yeggs to come quietly,
or you'll incur our wrath.

14:40.464 --> 14:43.092
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.428
Come on, boys. We've got too much to lose.

14:47.346 --> 14:49.473
I didn't know we're doing anything illegal.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.852
Mining into and under other people's property
is not illegal?

14:54.019 --> 14:58.023
- Not when you're slant drilling for oil.
- Which you were not.

14:58.190 --> 15:01.026
It's obvious that you're an innocent miner.

15:01.193 --> 15:04.279
All right, you may go. Whoa, whoa.

15:05.989 --> 15:10.536
- But this will take us to the bottom of the shaft.
-That's better than facing the Tawdry Trio.

15:10.702 --> 15:12.496
Mush!

15:21.755 --> 15:24.466
- They must have gone down.
-Holy journey to center of the Earth.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.719
- They won't stop until they--
-Bottom. Until they reach the bottom.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.263
But where is the bottom?

15:29.430 --> 15:31.765
Batgirl, you stand guard
in case they come back up.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.686
This time, we're gonna have to make
the two-minute mark in the mile, Robin.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.479
Let's go.

15:58.333 --> 16:02.379
Oh! Oh, do my old eyes deceive me?

16:02.546 --> 16:04.715
Oh, happiness unbounded.

16:04.882 --> 16:07.801
Oh, great blobs of joy.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.804
Eureka! I have found it.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.139
The Batcave.

16:12.306 --> 16:14.391
Right under Wayne Manor.

16:14.558 --> 16:17.019
Oh, dream of ha--

16:17.186 --> 16:18.520
Right under Wayne Manor?

16:18.687 --> 16:21.857
That means that they're-- Carry the three--

16:22.024 --> 16:27.321
That means Robin and Batman
are really Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson.

16:28.864 --> 16:32.534
Oh, the world is my oyster.

16:32.701 --> 16:36.622
And everyone will be bringing me sauce.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.418
A little winded, old chum?

16:41.585 --> 16:44.755
It takes more than a two-minute mile
to make me winded, Batman.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.593
Oh!

16:51.136 --> 16:55.057
Ah! Yeesh!

17:03.524 --> 17:08.111
Oh, how time flies when you're having fun.
Ha-ha-ha!

17:14.451 --> 17:16.828
- What will we do about that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.122
It's always darkest before the dawn, Robin.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.791
I know, I know,
and a rolling stone gathers no moss.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.794
And we shouldn't cry over spilt milk.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.630
Or waste time with old clichés.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.136
- Where is everybody, Batgirl?
- I'm here.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.889
Well, he means
Batman, Robin and King Tut.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.560
Oh, they've all gone on a journey
to the center of the Earth or something.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.645
The center of what?

17:41.812 --> 17:46.942
Oh, Florence,
the fruits of victory are sweet indeed.

17:47.109 --> 17:49.653
Maybe, Tut, but you'll still choke on them.

17:49.820 --> 17:53.532
From the mouths of babes
ofttimes comes pap.

17:53.699 --> 17:57.327
- Are you ready to give yourselves up?
-Not to you, Bat-dope...

17:57.494 --> 18:00.330
...or your 97-pound weakling bird boy.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.457
And where's your feminine friend?

18:02.624 --> 18:05.502
Don't want her to know
you're really Bruce Wayne, do you?

18:05.669 --> 18:08.171
Well, soon the world will know.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.216
You'll have to kill us
to keep our mouths shut.

18:11.383 --> 18:14.303
Tutlings, follow me.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.149
I'll give them Batnesia Gas, Robin.

19:51.316 --> 19:55.445
Tell Alfred take them topside and deposit them
on the lawn. They won't remember a thing.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.155
Roger.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.746
What about me, Batman?

20:04.913 --> 20:07.040
You'll have to kill me to keep me quiet.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.792
No, I won't.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.922
King Tut ran up the shaft.

20:14.089 --> 20:17.217
He moves quickly for an overstuffed
and unlikely Egyptian pharaoh.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.303
We must catch him
before he reaches the end of the shaft.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.098
Ah, drat, we're out of Batnesia Gas.

20:23.265 --> 20:27.436
Now we really must catch Tut
before he reaches the end of the shaft.

20:43.326 --> 20:46.163
Are you ready to be incarcerated, King Tut?

20:46.329 --> 20:48.331
With the greatest pleasure.

20:48.498 --> 20:52.502
You could jail me for a million years
and I wouldn't flinch an inch.

20:52.669 --> 20:56.840
Oh, at last, nirvana is within my grasp.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.760
You appear to be breezy
for a man about to be tucked away.

20:59.926 --> 21:03.472
I know.
And so would you if you knew what I know.

21:03.638 --> 21:07.100
And if I know you,
no doubt you know what I know now, no, huh?

21:07.267 --> 21:11.062
Why waste time with someone who knows?
Gotta find someone who doesn't. You know?

21:11.521 --> 21:13.482
- No.
-Sounds like the riddle of the sphinx.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.193
Nothing so simple as that, dear lady.

21:16.359 --> 21:19.154
I hold the key to the riddle of the ages.

21:21.740 --> 21:24.534
You're too late, Dynamic Dimwits.

21:24.701 --> 21:25.827
Holy waste of energy.

21:25.994 --> 21:27.621
- What has he told you?
-Nothing.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.999
He's been running off at the mouth
about some secret or riddle.

21:31.166 --> 21:34.377
The beans, so to speak,
are about to be spilled.

21:34.544 --> 21:38.632
Batman and Robin,
prepare to meet the end of your usefulness.

21:38.799 --> 21:42.260
Lady and gentlemen,
Batman and Robin are--

21:48.183 --> 21:50.268
It's only gonna prolong the agony, Batman.

21:50.435 --> 21:52.103
Not necessarily, Robin.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.815
That blow on his head
could be exactly what saves us.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.233
I certainly hope so.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.903
Where am I?

22:00.070 --> 22:02.155
You were about to tell us a secret, King Tut.

22:02.322 --> 22:06.076
King Tut?
My name is William Omaha McElroy...

22:06.243 --> 22:10.038
...and I'm professor of Egyptology
at Yale University.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.749
You don't remember
what you were going to tell us?

22:12.916 --> 22:15.794
Why do you have a purple mask on, lady?

22:16.086 --> 22:18.088
I'm going to be late for class.

22:18.255 --> 22:21.758
- Uh, just a moment, professor.
-You can't walk off like this.

22:21.925 --> 22:25.262
Harvard people, nice speaking to you.

22:25.929 --> 22:28.515
Holy razor's edge. Was that a close shave.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.767
A calculated risk, Robin.

22:30.934 --> 22:36.106
The shale held up by those sagging timbers
has been shifting for decades.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.608
All we had to do was taunt Tut
with our silence.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.778
This caused him
to raise his voice three decibels above high C...

22:41.945 --> 22:45.740
...which caused the cave-in,
which, of course, returned him to normalcy.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.076
But how could you be so sure?

22:48.243 --> 22:49.744
I really couldn't, Robin.

22:49.911 --> 22:52.747
Earth movement
is an inexact science at best.

22:52.914 --> 22:56.209
Matter of fact, yodels have been known
to cause avalanches in the Alps.

22:56.376 --> 23:01.131
A mere sneeze was the cause
of the 1923 Appalachian cave-in.

23:01.298 --> 23:02.924
But suppose something went wrong.

23:03.091 --> 23:06.636
Suppose Tut didn't raise his voice.
What then?

23:07.178 --> 23:11.141
I prefer not to think about those things,
Robin. They depress me.

23:14.686 --> 23:16.855
Thank you, sir, for calling.

23:18.148 --> 23:22.235
That was the president of Yale University,
Chief O'Hara.

23:22.485 --> 23:26.323
Our eminent professor of Egyptology
has completely returned to normal.

23:26.489 --> 23:31.828
Mm. Let's hope his ego has returned
to the altar in ancient Egypt.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.372
Daddy, have you heard the latest rumors?

23:34.539 --> 23:38.793
All of Gotham City is buzzing
about an imminent invasion of flying saucers.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.712
Well, now...

23:40.879 --> 23:43.590
...Gotham City is usually buzzing
about something, Barbara.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.509
- Well, let's take a look anyway, commissioner.
-All right.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.720
Let me have those.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.682
Well, now, let's see. Uh-huh.

23:53.350 --> 23:57.062
All I can see is sky, clouds and a few birds.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.522
- Let's see what you can find, chief.
- Hmm.

24:01.566 --> 24:07.739
Well, there's a blimp
trailing some joker's used-car advertisements.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.700
<i>NARRATOR".
Look again. In this flying saucer...</i>

24:10.867 --> 24:15.080
<i>...the Joker is planning an incredible invasion
of Gotham City.</i>

24:16.581 --> 24:20.752
As soon as the range-sweep radar scanner
picks up the tracking pulse amplifier...

24:20.919 --> 24:25.548
...we will spin back into the substratosphere,
where I will issue my demands...

24:25.715 --> 24:30.220
...that will have not only all of Gotham City
but the world at my feet.
