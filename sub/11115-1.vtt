00:07.764 --> 00:08.823
Hike.

00:13.303 --> 00:14.532
Stop it!

00:17.075 --> 00:18.134
Go!

00:19.944 --> 00:21.503
What's up, boys?

00:26.885 --> 00:28.409
All right, let's go.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:42.234 --> 00:43.793
Let's go. Break.

00:50.577 --> 00:51.635
Hike.

01:55.479 --> 01:58.107
- What? Where are you going? Come here.
- Oh, my God, Dad.

01:58.216 --> 02:01.446
Get in the car.
You're gonna be late for school. Come on.

02:02.152 --> 02:04.052
- Mom's gonna kill you.
- What?

02:04.154 --> 02:05.679
What are you doing?

02:05.789 --> 02:08.088
Dad, I'm driving. No.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.262
Get out of the car, Dad.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.165
- What?
- Get out of the car.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.449
- Seat belt.
- Yeah.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.962
- What's the big deal?
- Can you just get in the car, please?

03:23.573 --> 03:26.006
Let's go hunting.
Wanna go hunting this weekend?

03:26.109 --> 03:28.407
Okay, let's go. Where are we going hunting?

03:28.510 --> 03:32.470
You can use that old Jap 243
that Grandpa brought back from Truk.

03:32.916 --> 03:36.044
- From where?
- Truk Islands, the South Pacific.

03:37.587 --> 03:40.681
- Admiral Halsey, World War II.
- Yeah, right.

03:41.225 --> 03:42.590
I was there.

03:45.563 --> 03:47.553
You've been there, right, Dad?

03:48.631 --> 03:49.690
No.

04:07.852 --> 04:10.320
- Can I take your guys' picture?
- Why?

04:10.589 --> 04:13.956
I'm just developing my portfolio right now,
doing random projects.

04:14.059 --> 04:15.754
What's a portfolio?

04:15.927 --> 04:19.522
It's when you put together pictures
to present your work.

04:19.899 --> 04:23.129
- Get into galleries, stuff like that.
- What kind of work?

04:23.970 --> 04:26.165
Anything. Like, portraits mainly.

04:26.272 --> 04:28.467
- Like, naked people?
- No.

04:29.108 --> 04:32.168
Want us to get naked with you,
take our picture?

04:33.013 --> 04:35.947
No. I'm not for the outdoor-naked thing.

04:36.383 --> 04:38.351
Public nudity is... No.

04:38.951 --> 04:41.113
- No, we won't do that.
- All right, man.

04:41.220 --> 04:42.813
Yeah? Okay, good.

04:44.591 --> 04:46.150
You're too kind.

04:50.298 --> 04:52.027
All right, let's go.

04:52.799 --> 04:54.994
Be a little happier. Come on.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.505
There you go.

05:00.140 --> 05:01.802
Kind of look away.

05:03.478 --> 05:05.140
Make a funny face.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.110
One more.

05:09.051 --> 05:11.042
Yeah, good. Keep walking.

05:16.125 --> 05:17.615
Maybe one kiss.

05:20.095 --> 05:22.792
Perfect. All right,
I actually gotta get to school.

05:22.898 --> 05:25.231
- My name's Caroline.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Eli.

05:25.335 --> 05:27.235
- Nice to meet you, too.
- What's up?

05:27.337 --> 05:31.102
I'll give you guys a print
the next time I see you, or whenever.

05:31.207 --> 05:34.973
- I'll try and make one today.
- All right. See you later, man.

06:10.349 --> 06:13.581
All right, Dad, you stay here.
Paul will come pick you up.

06:21.828 --> 06:25.696
Dad, just stay in the car. I gotta go.
Just stay in the car, please.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.219
Hey, Paul? Yeah, it's John.

06:55.362 --> 06:56.990
Dad's drunk again.

06:58.032 --> 06:59.795
So, Mr. McFarland...

07:00.436 --> 07:02.835
Hi, Mr. Luce. I'm sorry I'm late.

07:03.571 --> 07:05.596
My dad took me out to lunch.

07:05.708 --> 07:08.176
- I mean, breakfast.
- Meet me in my office.

07:09.578 --> 07:11.306
I'm in trouble now.

07:14.049 --> 07:17.577
Will you pick him up?
I'll leave the keys in the office.

07:18.387 --> 07:22.085
Can you do it soon?
'Cause I don't know if he's gonna stay.

08:40.241 --> 08:41.606
Set. Hike!

12:55.778 --> 12:57.336
He's so cute.

13:31.483 --> 13:33.416
- How are you?
- Good, and how are you?

13:33.517 --> 13:36.043
I'm doing pretty good. How was Math?

13:37.656 --> 13:39.954
- How do you think?
- That good?

13:41.426 --> 13:43.724
That's all right, you know, it happens.

13:45.231 --> 13:47.859
How's Sara doing?
Is everything okay with her?

13:47.966 --> 13:49.935
She seemed a little off lately.

13:51.137 --> 13:54.197
Yeah, I guess so. How's school for you?

13:55.441 --> 13:57.875
It's about as good as it could be.

13:58.477 --> 14:02.004
- Is P.E. Treating you all right?
- Yeah.

14:06.986 --> 14:08.249
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

14:08.354 --> 14:09.788
- We need to sign out.
- Okay.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.791
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

14:13.259 --> 14:14.784
What do you need, hon?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.543
Get to class.

14:29.978 --> 14:32.105
Don't be late for detention.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.684
- Excuse me, miss? We need to sign out.
- Where was that picture taken?

14:41.790 --> 14:44.758
That picture was taken in Hawaii,
on the island of Maui.

14:44.860 --> 14:47.761
- That's real pretty.
- Isn't that cool? What do you need?

14:48.063 --> 14:50.190
I need to leave these keys for my brother.

14:50.299 --> 14:53.632
He's gonna come pick them up, 11:30-ish.

14:54.371 --> 14:58.671
Put the keys in the envelope,
and put your brother's name on there.

14:58.774 --> 15:00.333
His name's Paul.

15:04.147 --> 15:06.479
By the way, what time will you be back?

15:06.584 --> 15:08.448
Right around 1:30 p.m.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.684
- 11:30 you said?
- Yeah, about.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.757
- Okay, great.
- All right, thanks.

15:14.392 --> 15:16.985
And don't forget to bring your own steaks.

15:17.094 --> 15:18.755
- I'll see you then.
- Yeah, okay.

15:18.863 --> 15:21.423
I'm saving for my car.
I'm paying it off this month.

15:21.532 --> 15:22.521
Surprise!

16:10.651 --> 16:11.777
Hello.

16:12.386 --> 16:13.375
Hi.

16:17.659 --> 16:19.092
What's wrong?

16:19.828 --> 16:21.022
Nothing.

16:21.428 --> 16:23.954
- You were crying.
- Yeah.

16:24.498 --> 16:27.695
- Is it something bad?
- I don't know.

16:30.872 --> 16:34.433
I'll see you later. I have to go
to a Gay-Straight Alliance meeting.

16:34.542 --> 16:35.601
Okay.

16:48.991 --> 16:51.016
Hi, Acadia, how you doing?

16:51.495 --> 16:54.794
We were talking about
walking down a street being gay.

16:54.897 --> 16:57.559
What do you think about that?
How can you tell?

16:57.667 --> 17:00.135
- Or can you tell?
- Good question.

17:00.436 --> 17:03.235
See, that's the thing. I don't think you can.

17:03.341 --> 17:05.968
I think in some situations you can tell...

17:06.077 --> 17:08.704
and there are situations
where people want you to know.

17:08.811 --> 17:12.009
What makes you think you can tell?
If somebody wants you to know.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.708
If someone has...

17:16.154 --> 17:17.644
dyed pink hair.

17:17.922 --> 17:20.220
Wait, what do you think about that?

17:20.992 --> 17:23.586
I know it is,
but what do you think about that?

17:23.694 --> 17:26.357
I don't think that wearing pink...

17:26.763 --> 17:29.494
indicates your
sexual orientation necessarily.

17:29.601 --> 17:32.434
- A lot of men wear pink.
- It is a lot, yeah.

17:32.538 --> 17:33.869
Like rainbow necklaces.

17:33.972 --> 17:37.500
I mean, if you have
tons of rainbow paraphernalia...

17:37.709 --> 17:40.735
Jump in on this.
Help them out here a little bit.

17:41.381 --> 17:42.473
Come on.

17:42.581 --> 17:46.109
Did you guys see the cover story
on The Oregonian about the gay rams?

17:46.218 --> 17:49.244
Yeah. See, this is a good topic here.
Go ahead.

17:49.355 --> 17:52.916
Because apparently the farmers can't tell
if the rams are gay or not.

17:53.026 --> 17:57.054
So you get a ram to breed and it's not...

17:57.464 --> 18:01.332
so they waste a lot of money.
So they're doing all this research.

18:01.434 --> 18:03.869
They spend, like, $10,000 on a ram.

18:03.970 --> 18:06.371
That's a lot of money for one ram.

18:06.907 --> 18:11.367
But the scary thing is
if they know what causes homosexuality...

18:11.479 --> 18:14.676
is that something you could change,
something you could remove?

18:14.783 --> 18:17.149
There's all this
weird political stuff around it.

18:17.251 --> 18:20.585
I don't think we're talking about
the change, necessarily.

18:20.689 --> 18:23.487
We're talking about
if we notice somebody on the street...

18:23.592 --> 18:26.060
if we can tell they're gay.
I don't think you can.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.288
How in the world do we know their spirit?

18:28.396 --> 18:32.389
If they wear one of those bracelets,
the rainbow and stuff, that's a giver.

18:32.502 --> 18:35.766
Somebody walking on the street,
all dressed up, wearing high heels...

18:35.872 --> 18:39.239
Rainbow bracelets don't necessarily mean
that you're gay.

18:39.775 --> 18:42.470
I've never seen anybody wear one
that isn't gay.

18:43.679 --> 18:47.809
- Me, for example.
- Then why would it even matter?

18:48.284 --> 18:52.153
You're wearing a bracelet
and you're not gay. Who cares either way?

18:52.256 --> 18:56.192
- What time will you be back?
- Right around 1:30 p.m.

18:56.460 --> 18:57.518
Okay.

19:01.632 --> 19:03.190
Here's the deal.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.365
Aaron and I and some of the other boys...

19:06.471 --> 19:09.201
we're gonna go fourbying later today.

19:09.673 --> 19:13.940
We were wondering if maybe you would
like to bring some of the girls along.

19:15.013 --> 19:17.504
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

19:17.615 --> 19:20.550
- Of course. How could I forget?
- With Sara and Jessica?

19:20.653 --> 19:24.919
- Sara and Jessica, they're...
- Don't be mean.

19:25.024 --> 19:28.424
I never tease you about Jason
and his hot dogs, or whatever.

19:28.661 --> 19:30.890
That was an isolated incident.

19:31.864 --> 19:34.264
Besides, I don't know if I can go.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.227
I don't know what time I'll get home.

19:37.436 --> 19:39.996
- Home from the appointment?
- Yeah.

19:41.841 --> 19:44.638
Does that, by any chance, have to do with...

19:44.744 --> 19:48.373
when we went camping,
two or three weeks ago?

19:48.481 --> 19:50.779
I don't know. It could be anything.

19:52.118 --> 19:55.144
You know what? You don't have to worry
about it. You know why?

19:55.255 --> 19:57.723
Because we're gonna
have a blast fourbying...

19:57.824 --> 20:00.259
as long as...
You gotta promise to show up.

20:06.701 --> 20:08.430
- Hey, Eli!
- What's up, John?

20:08.537 --> 20:10.663
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

20:11.038 --> 20:13.336
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

20:13.442 --> 20:16.205
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

20:19.414 --> 20:21.541
Okay, ready? One, two, three.

20:21.917 --> 20:23.714
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

20:23.920 --> 20:27.287
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

20:27.389 --> 20:29.290
That's retarded. That happens.

20:29.391 --> 20:31.292
All right. I'll see you.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.815
Boomer!

21:30.189 --> 21:31.486
Come here.

21:42.135 --> 21:43.396
What are you guys doing?

21:43.503 --> 21:45.630
Get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.799
- Some heavy shit's going down.
- What are you doing?

22:03.591 --> 22:07.584
When the electrons jump
from one orbital to another one...

22:08.229 --> 22:12.030
what does that do?
What's the difference between the orbitals?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.994
The orbitals differ in energy.

22:15.336 --> 22:18.704
The orbitals, which are areas in space
around the nucleus...

22:18.807 --> 22:21.971
the ones that are closer to the nucleus,
those are low energy...

22:22.077 --> 22:24.739
and the ones that are further away
are higher energy.

22:24.848 --> 22:28.147
So when we put energy into the atom...

22:28.250 --> 22:30.515
it kicks these electrons out...

22:30.653 --> 22:34.248
further away from the nucleus,
and produces a higher... Yes?

22:34.591 --> 22:37.651
After putting electricity
into the tube full of the electrons...

22:37.761 --> 22:42.130
after they're lit up, do they stay lit up
or can they run out of energy?

22:42.233 --> 22:44.564
Good question. What they do...

22:44.934 --> 22:48.097
is they will sit up
in this higher energy state...

22:48.371 --> 22:50.704
and then drop down again.

22:50.807 --> 22:53.572
And when they drop down, they emit light.

24:07.922 --> 24:09.116
What are you writing?

24:09.225 --> 24:10.249
- This?
- Yeah.

24:10.358 --> 24:11.417
It's my plan.

24:11.526 --> 24:13.357
- For what?
- You'll see.

25:32.378 --> 25:34.471
- Hey, Eli, what's up?
- Hey, how are you?

25:34.582 --> 25:38.040
Not much. I'm just gonna go
to the darkroom and stuff, so...

25:38.953 --> 25:41.888
Yeah. Watch out for Mr. Robertson's class.

25:42.022 --> 25:43.683
Yeah, I know. No kidding.

25:43.792 --> 25:46.283
- All right, I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

26:25.202 --> 26:27.170
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, actually.

26:27.270 --> 26:29.033
- How about you?
- Fine.

28:03.005 --> 28:06.304
Michelle, look, we've got to talk
about this gym clothes problem.

28:06.408 --> 28:08.969
This is not gonna do it, these long pants.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.672
Everybody else is wearing shorts.
What's the matter?

28:11.780 --> 28:13.681
I don't want to talk about it.

28:13.783 --> 28:16.752
I don't want to give you a mark
against you, either.

28:16.854 --> 28:19.617
But I'll have to do it
if you can't show up in shorts...

28:19.722 --> 28:21.122
like you are supposed to.

28:21.225 --> 28:23.624
Look, I won't do anything about it
this time...

28:23.726 --> 28:27.788
but tomorrow, I want to see those shorts.

28:28.098 --> 28:29.292
Okay!

32:38.397 --> 32:41.833
There's that nerd girl
who sits behind you in Math class.

32:41.933 --> 32:44.629
- That one right there.
- Yeah. Her.

32:51.343 --> 32:53.106
Green panties?

33:21.076 --> 33:22.406
Loser.

34:40.826 --> 34:43.989
- Where'd you take that at?
- The bleachers outside.

34:44.264 --> 34:46.060
Pretty blurry, though.

34:58.578 --> 35:01.548
- What's that?
- It's a rip in his shirt.

35:01.649 --> 35:04.344
I thought it was coming out of her head.

35:06.921 --> 35:10.084
- I took that outside at the park earlier.
- Really?

35:19.467 --> 35:22.162
That's pretty. Where'd you take that at?

35:23.205 --> 35:24.570
At my house.

35:25.407 --> 35:27.432
That's my light assignment.

35:29.077 --> 35:33.173
Great contrast. I like how you can barely see
the fence right there.

36:00.310 --> 36:04.179
I think I'll make another print, though.
It came out too light.

36:06.149 --> 36:08.641
Yeah, you should burn in right here.

37:27.602 --> 37:29.263
- Hey, Eli.
- What's up, John?

37:29.371 --> 37:31.169
- How's it going?
- Good, how about you?

37:31.273 --> 37:34.004
- Pretty good. What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

37:34.109 --> 37:36.510
- Can I take a picture of you?
- Yeah, sure.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.209
Okay, ready? One, two, go.

37:42.151 --> 37:44.551
- Nice.
- All right, I'll see you later.

37:44.654 --> 37:47.920
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

37:48.024 --> 37:49.583
That's retarded. That happens.

37:49.692 --> 37:51.353
All right. See you.

38:39.178 --> 38:40.770
Come on out here.

38:41.314 --> 38:44.613
I got a job for you here.
You can take these books...

38:44.751 --> 38:48.687
and you can reshelf them right over there,
if you would, please.

38:49.823 --> 38:51.917
I'll be here if you need me.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.997
- That's what they told me.
- I don't know.

39:04.104 --> 39:07.165
- I mean, it's really hard to decide.
- Yeah, I know.

39:08.109 --> 39:10.771
I mean, the money's really nice, but...

39:12.981 --> 39:14.242
He's so cute.

39:14.349 --> 39:15.872
- Did she see you?
- Who?

39:15.984 --> 39:17.542
Did she see you?

39:18.187 --> 39:20.178
- Who?
- Her. His girlfriend.

39:20.589 --> 39:22.488
He has a girlfriend? Since when?

39:22.591 --> 39:24.286
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

39:24.393 --> 39:25.588
A long time.

39:25.694 --> 39:28.128
- Are you joking?
- I hope she didn't see you.

39:28.230 --> 39:31.529
- She's not gonna do anything.
- She hit a girl last time for that.

39:31.634 --> 39:33.864
- Hit a girl?
- She slapped a girl.

39:33.969 --> 39:35.130
No way.

39:35.504 --> 39:37.939
She smiled, he smiled, and she slapped her.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.441
My gosh, I cannot believe that.
Are you joking?

39:40.543 --> 39:42.841
- I saw it.
- Why wouldn't she slap him?

39:42.947 --> 39:44.709
- Because...
- It's not the girl's fault.

39:44.814 --> 39:46.146
All girls do that.

39:46.249 --> 39:49.219
- In the middle of the hall?
- Yeah. After school last Friday.

39:49.320 --> 39:52.517
Wow, I am so tired.
I haven't been getting any sleep lately...

39:52.622 --> 39:56.058
'cause every morning, I wake up
and my mom's going through my stuff.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.128
- Going through your stuff?
- Yeah.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.027
Completely, like,
ruffling through my covers and like...

40:01.131 --> 40:02.793
- Your covers?
- Yeah.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.028
Like, what would I hide there?
What am I gonna be hiding?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.536
I don't know.
Didn't your mom used to do that to you?

40:08.639 --> 40:11.904
She did that a couple days ago.
She was going through it, and I said:

40:12.010 --> 40:14.342
"Don't go through my shit.
I don't go through yours.

40:14.446 --> 40:17.142
"It's not like you own my stuff.
I don't own your stuff."

40:17.250 --> 40:20.116
I don't know. I talk to her about it,
and she'll be like:

40:20.218 --> 40:22.744
"Okay, I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore."

40:22.854 --> 40:26.621
And then all of sudden, I'll come home,
and she's in my room.

40:26.759 --> 40:30.160
They think it's their job
because they're the parents of the house.

40:30.263 --> 40:33.391
I'm sick of it. I want out of here.
I'm so ready to go to college.

40:33.499 --> 40:35.365
Yeah, I wanna get out of here.

40:35.968 --> 40:38.528
Only one more year, though, you guys.

40:38.771 --> 40:41.205
One more year. Count it down.

40:44.477 --> 40:47.572
- What to eat?
- I can't wait to go off campus.

40:48.215 --> 40:50.683
- Can I help you?
- Can I have a milk?

40:50.784 --> 40:53.310
Wait, no, I think I want a Capri Sun.

40:53.687 --> 40:56.623
- Can I have a juice?
- I'll have that milk. Thanks.

40:56.724 --> 40:58.282
Juice. This one.

40:58.626 --> 41:00.593
Yeah. Thanks.

41:02.297 --> 41:04.128
What do I want?

41:05.533 --> 41:08.401
- None of it looks that good.
- It never does.

41:09.038 --> 41:11.267
- Some kids like this stuff.
- Thank you.

41:11.373 --> 41:14.308
I know, they come back for, like,
seconds and thirds.

41:14.410 --> 41:16.241
They just keep coming?

41:24.987 --> 41:25.955
Salads?

41:56.253 --> 41:58.916
It's too crowded. Let's go to the back.

42:00.092 --> 42:03.459
- Where's a table nobody's sitting at?
- Where's your salad dressing?

42:03.561 --> 42:07.623
- I don't eat salad dressing anymore.
- You don't? I thought you loved it.

42:07.733 --> 42:11.430
No, I hate it. I used to like it,
and then I tried once without it.

42:11.536 --> 42:14.301
- I cannot stand it without.
- You know it has fat?

42:14.406 --> 42:16.806
You know salad dressing has
20 grams of fat in it?

42:16.909 --> 42:19.377
- Shut up.
- It's not like it stays in us anyway.

42:19.478 --> 42:21.309
I can't believe you just said that.

42:21.413 --> 42:23.939
- What if somebody heard you?
- It's the truth.

42:24.417 --> 42:25.816
Is that John?

42:26.319 --> 42:27.877
What is he doing?

42:27.987 --> 42:30.148
- Is that a dog?
- I didn't know he had a dog.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.724
Why would he bring it to school
if he did have a dog?

42:32.825 --> 42:35.488
- I have no idea.
- Maybe he just found it.

42:41.868 --> 42:43.928
You guys want to go shopping today?

42:44.038 --> 42:45.801
That sounds like fun.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.565
I don't know. Ben wanted to do something.

42:48.677 --> 42:50.702
- Are you joking me?
- What?

42:52.179 --> 42:55.172
This is the fifth day in a row
you're not hanging out with us.

42:55.283 --> 42:58.547
You guys, it's like,
how much time do you want?

42:59.054 --> 43:00.749
Put a number on it.

43:02.123 --> 43:05.752
I don't even want to talk about it.
You spend so much time with him.

43:05.860 --> 43:08.761
You get, like, 75% to 85% of my time.

43:09.065 --> 43:11.033
- Yeah, right. More like 20%.
- You do!

43:11.566 --> 43:13.262
School, after school...

43:13.368 --> 43:17.271
You know, you can't have both weekends.
I need to split it a little more evenly.

43:17.373 --> 43:19.637
We're not just people
to be pushed out of the way.

43:19.742 --> 43:22.506
I'm not saying that.
You're both very important to me.

43:22.611 --> 43:25.580
I'm supposed to be your best friend
and you pushed me out of it.

43:25.681 --> 43:29.379
You're both equally as important,
but my time has to be split up.

43:29.485 --> 43:31.920
What do you want? 95% and he gets 5%?

43:32.021 --> 43:35.890
Your friends are supposed to be
just as important, if not more.

43:36.960 --> 43:41.090
- All the time. Haven't you ever heard that?
- I've heard that, but it's different.

43:41.199 --> 43:43.962
I've been there for you, through everything.

43:44.068 --> 43:48.027
We've been best friends for, what,
three years now? Since high school started.

43:48.138 --> 43:51.700
- I know, I'm working.
- I'm done, guys.

43:52.043 --> 43:53.510
Let's just go.

43:56.849 --> 43:58.510
I'm going shopping.

43:59.350 --> 44:00.648
Sounds like fun. I'll go.

44:00.753 --> 44:03.619
I don't want to be
the only one not going. I'll go.

44:03.722 --> 44:06.054
Okay, I'll go, but you cannot drive.

44:06.158 --> 44:07.989
Yeah, you're not driving.

44:08.093 --> 44:09.788
I am such a good driver.

44:09.895 --> 44:13.126
- You are not.
- That's mean. You guys can't say that.

44:18.838 --> 44:22.501
I don't understand because everyone else
thinks I'm a good singer...

44:22.608 --> 44:25.544
and a couple of weeks ago,
when I sang Star-Spangled Banner...

44:25.645 --> 44:27.510
everyone thought it was really good.

44:27.614 --> 44:31.482
That's why I'm really confused
that you would say something like that.

44:31.718 --> 44:35.119
Seriously, I mean, why?
Why do you think I'm such a bad singer?

44:35.222 --> 44:38.157
Do you guys have cars?
Because I don't think you do.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.385
So, how else are you
going to get anywhere?

44:40.494 --> 44:43.520
We'll go, just drive 15 under the speed limit.

44:43.631 --> 44:45.724
You have to have your hands at ten and two.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.858
- That's no fun.
- Go back to the basic rules.

44:47.968 --> 44:50.232
When you guys get your licenses,
you'll understand.

44:50.338 --> 44:53.603
We'll understand?
I just want to live to get my license.

44:53.975 --> 44:57.433
- We want to live to see the rest of our lives.
- I'm not gonna kill you.

44:57.546 --> 44:58.877
It'll be in the newspaper...

44:58.980 --> 45:02.006
I might run into a couple of people
on the way, but...

45:02.117 --> 45:03.607
It's not funny.

45:04.386 --> 45:08.483
Oh, my gosh. It'll be fine. We'll just go.

45:12.195 --> 45:14.390
- This is disgusting.
- I ate too much.

45:14.497 --> 45:17.057
I always feel so fat after I'm done eating.

45:17.867 --> 45:19.596
- Every time.
- Do you ever get...

45:19.702 --> 45:22.501
- The pudge there?
- Where it sticks out above your belt?

45:22.605 --> 45:25.131
And you can't get rid of it, no matter what.

45:27.477 --> 45:29.239
So gross.

47:44.289 --> 47:45.779
That's awesome.

47:46.324 --> 47:47.621
What's up?

50:54.558 --> 50:55.785
You suck.

53:46.338 --> 53:48.067
- See you tonight, dear.
- Yeah.

53:48.908 --> 53:52.708
You know, Jared's got the pole this week
and the track record.

54:09.363 --> 54:10.955
What's that smell?

54:11.365 --> 54:13.265
That's just your mom.

54:14.201 --> 54:18.467
You could find other places to eat.
I'm sure there's better restaurants in town.

54:18.573 --> 54:20.302
No, you're the best.

54:21.509 --> 54:23.569
- Want more of these?
- No thanks.

54:30.252 --> 54:32.220
All right, lock the door.

54:41.063 --> 54:43.190
The radio has wholly taken over.

54:47.270 --> 54:49.000
Many of the cinema's...

54:49.105 --> 54:51.596
- What was that?
- I don't know.

54:53.676 --> 54:55.769
All scripts must now be vetted.

54:57.747 --> 55:01.081
The casting of actors must be approved.
From now on...

55:01.184 --> 55:05.417
the German people will only know
what their Führer wants them to know.

55:05.522 --> 55:07.387
Propaganda brought us into power.

55:07.491 --> 55:08.958
That's a lot of flags.

55:10.127 --> 55:12.618
- This was made in Germany, right?
- Yeah.

55:12.730 --> 55:15.756
Propaganda will enable us
to conquer the world.

55:17.168 --> 55:20.569
In his early Munich days,
Hitler had taken an old Hindu symbol...

55:20.672 --> 55:23.971
the hooked cross, the Swastika,
as the Nazi symbol.

55:24.576 --> 55:27.170
Now he multiplies it a million times.

55:34.620 --> 55:36.815
From the Romans, he steals the standards...

55:36.922 --> 55:41.053
- Can you still buy Nazi flags?
- Sure, if you're a nut.

55:42.762 --> 55:45.663
From Mussolini, he steals the Fascist salute.

55:47.400 --> 55:48.833
Check it out.

55:51.705 --> 55:54.538
Führer, command, we follow you.

55:55.809 --> 55:58.334
The Führer is always right.

56:00.981 --> 56:02.107
Who's that guy?

56:02.783 --> 56:04.512
- That's Hitler, right?
- Yeah.

56:04.618 --> 56:07.213
...who fears the intellect
and hates all intellectuals.

56:07.321 --> 56:11.018
So into the flames are flung the works
not only of German philosophers...

56:11.125 --> 56:14.094
scientists, doctors, poets,
playwrights, novelists...

56:14.195 --> 56:16.026
but those of all the world.

56:16.397 --> 56:19.662
Students as well as storm troopers
obey the Führer's orders.

56:19.768 --> 56:23.567
Any culture except Nazi Kultur
must be destroyed.

56:25.273 --> 56:26.969
Hey, how you doing?

56:27.911 --> 56:29.811
You guys must be out of school today.

56:29.913 --> 56:31.642
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.774
I'll have you sign for me here.

56:39.455 --> 56:41.855
That's great. Thank you very much.

56:45.528 --> 56:47.120
Sweet. It's here.

56:52.035 --> 56:53.866
At a vast meeting in Berlin...

56:53.970 --> 56:58.465
Mussolini thanks Germany for her help
in his brutal Abyssinian War.

57:06.884 --> 57:08.784
And the Führer replies:

57:13.858 --> 57:17.350
- Oh, yeah, dude.
- This is so awesome.

57:17.597 --> 57:19.655
"Peace," did Hitler say?

57:23.835 --> 57:26.099
Let's check this shit out, man.

57:34.814 --> 57:37.305
- Hell, yeah, dude.
- Sweet.

57:46.159 --> 57:46.920
Back up.

57:58.339 --> 58:00.499
Whoa, dude, that was awesome.

58:49.226 --> 58:50.250
Hey, Eli!

58:50.360 --> 58:51.953
- What's up, John?
- How's it going?

58:52.062 --> 58:53.496
- Pretty good. And you?
- Good.

58:53.597 --> 58:56.031
- What are you doing?
- Just taking pictures.

58:56.133 --> 58:58.567
Can I take a picture of you?

59:06.644 --> 59:08.704
- Nice.
- I'll see you later.

59:08.813 --> 59:12.511
- You going to the concert tonight?
- No, my parents are being bitches.

59:14.219 --> 59:15.652
- All right.
- See you.

59:56.931 --> 59:59.365
Hi, Michelle. Glad you could make it.

59:59.467 --> 01:00:01.867
Please come in and sign in here,
then come out.

01:00:01.969 --> 01:00:04.996
There are a few things
we can work on together.

01:00:07.008 --> 01:00:09.568
First, if you want to just take this
cart of books...

01:00:09.678 --> 01:00:12.373
and you can reshelf it over there
in the non-fiction.

01:00:12.481 --> 01:00:15.507
I'll be right here to help you if you need me.

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:24.686
I guess this is it. We're gonna die today.

01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.888
Yeah, I've never even kissed anybody.
Have you?

01:01:44.144 --> 01:01:46.510
"I don't appreciate you
putting signs out like that."

01:01:46.614 --> 01:01:50.277
The next day, he called up his friend
and has him put out another sign.

01:01:50.384 --> 01:01:54.480
And she doesn't see it.
And so he puts out another one.

01:01:56.457 --> 01:02:00.451
Like, right in front of her house,
in front of her apartment thing.

01:02:00.929 --> 01:02:02.123
It says:

01:02:04.533 --> 01:02:07.093
"Tim Campbell's whorehouse
has been shut down."

01:02:07.336 --> 01:02:11.602
Or "Has been placed under new ownership
by" whatever her name was.

01:02:12.307 --> 01:02:14.367
He couldn't cut it anymore.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:18.278
All right, let's see this.
So, we'll park here, right?

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:22.515
We'll enter through the south entrance.

01:02:25.788 --> 01:02:29.952
Then we go past the trophy case and the
medal case, enter through the language lab.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.426
They don't use it anymore,
so nobody'll be there.

01:02:36.533 --> 01:02:39.195
We'll gear up there,
we'll hear the primary explosions...

01:02:39.303 --> 01:02:41.271
go about here in the cafeteria, right?

01:02:45.309 --> 01:02:47.777
When that goes, we should be able
to pick off kids...

01:02:47.878 --> 01:02:49.346
as we traverse the east wing.

01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:55.012
And then we have another explosion
that should go off here in the gym...

01:02:55.119 --> 01:02:56.916
and here in the auditorium.

01:02:57.021 --> 01:03:00.219
At that time, there should be
kids flushing out in all directions...

01:03:00.325 --> 01:03:02.590
and we'll be able to pick them off,
one by one.

01:03:09.601 --> 01:03:14.266
After that, you'll hit your yellow line here,
which is your plan B.

01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:18.068
And you'll go up through Mr. Luce's office
and take care of that.

01:03:20.113 --> 01:03:21.171
Fuck!

01:03:21.281 --> 01:03:23.909
While I go, on the red line,
up through this hallway...

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:26.884
where we'll have the best targets,
dumb-ass jocks and shit.

01:03:27.787 --> 01:03:30.450
Because we'll have a fucking
field day down there.

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:34.085
I mean, come on.
You've got your Tec-9 and your rifle...

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:36.989
and I've got my shotty and my.223
on my back.

01:03:37.097 --> 01:03:39.588
And I got a couple pistols and a knife.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.669
We have enough explosives to last us
almost a day.

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:45.261
- Most importantly, have fun, man.
- Yeah, man.

01:05:20.307 --> 01:05:21.672
What are you guys doing?

01:05:21.775 --> 01:05:26.075
Get the fuck out and don't come back.
Some heavy shit's going down.

01:05:34.989 --> 01:05:36.854
Hey, don't go in there.

01:05:37.925 --> 01:05:41.861
Hey, you guys, don't go in there.
Something bad is gonna happen.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:44.330
Don't go in there, okay?

01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:56.439
Dude, what the fuck?

01:05:57.045 --> 01:06:00.276
Don't worry about it, it's probably just slow.
Let's go to plan B.

01:06:00.382 --> 01:06:03.147
- Are you sure you set it right?
- Positive.

01:06:15.999 --> 01:06:18.434
Sir, don't go in there! Trust me!

01:06:18.535 --> 01:06:21.266
Just don't go in there, please. Don't go in!

01:06:22.873 --> 01:06:23.897
Dad!

01:07:11.758 --> 01:07:13.248
Hey, you guys...

01:07:39.721 --> 01:07:41.188
What was that?

01:07:41.523 --> 01:07:45.481
- Sounded like bombs. That's fine.
- No more homework, no teachers.

01:07:45.927 --> 01:07:48.226
- That'd be so cool.
- That'd be nice.

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:50.998
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.835
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:07:53.936 --> 01:07:55.528
Okay, then be a bitch.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.005
What a freak.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:10.212
I think maybe everyone could bring...

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.684
Well, I don't drink soda,
but some people do...

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:15.948
What was that?

01:08:16.059 --> 01:08:18.290
Firecracker. Don't worry about it.
It'll be okay.

01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:20.728
Come on, sit down. Let's finish this.

01:08:20.831 --> 01:08:23.857
Okay now, we talked about
what we're gonna do...

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.529
Nate? Come on, get up, Nate.

01:09:36.444 --> 01:09:38.412
Here we go, let's go.

01:10:39.111 --> 01:10:41.738
Come on, let's go, now!

01:10:41.847 --> 01:10:43.280
It sounds clear. Go!

01:10:43.382 --> 01:10:46.044
Down the hallway to the band room exit!

01:10:46.519 --> 01:10:47.986
Hey, Mr. Luce.

01:10:51.023 --> 01:10:53.389
Why are you doing this?
Eric, put the gun down.

01:10:53.493 --> 01:10:55.484
I ain't putting shit down!

01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:59.260
Put the gun down, we'll talk about this.

01:10:59.365 --> 01:11:00.389
Shut up!

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.204
Dad!

01:11:19.854 --> 01:11:21.617
The school's on fire.

01:11:21.722 --> 01:11:24.418
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what's going on?

01:11:25.393 --> 01:11:27.293
I saw two guys come in the other side.

01:11:27.429 --> 01:11:28.828
Holy cow!

01:11:29.464 --> 01:11:32.956
They had big black bags
and camo gear on.

01:11:33.068 --> 01:11:34.296
My God.

01:11:35.136 --> 01:11:37.832
- Where did you go?
- I just...

01:11:39.675 --> 01:11:40.971
I'm sorry.

01:12:14.578 --> 01:12:18.811
Yeah, you did, and I should shoot you
right now for it, you know I should.

01:12:18.916 --> 01:12:23.115
But I think I just might let you live,
maybe, because I want you to know this...

01:12:23.221 --> 01:12:26.089
and the next kids that come up to you
with their problems...

01:12:26.190 --> 01:12:28.988
that they're being picked on,
you should listen to them...

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:31.493
no matter what twisted shit they say.

01:12:38.938 --> 01:12:39.996
Fuck.

01:12:40.306 --> 01:12:42.365
Anyway, Mr. Luce, whatever.

01:12:43.643 --> 01:12:46.634
You know there's others like us
out there, too.

01:12:46.746 --> 01:12:51.045
And they will kill you if you fuck with them
like you did me and Jared.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:55.046
Get out of here,
before I change my mind. Go!

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.326
Bitch.

01:13:39.468 --> 01:13:42.233
"So foul and fair a day I have not seen."

01:14:14.105 --> 01:14:15.162
Fuck!

01:14:41.967 --> 01:14:44.435
- Oh, my God, there he is!
- Oh, shit!

01:15:58.015 --> 01:16:01.712
Hey, man. I wouldn't drink that.
You'll get herpes or something.

01:16:04.421 --> 01:16:07.585
- So how did you do?
- Did all right. What happened?

01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:11.221
I shot the principal
and some other people, and...

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:18.158
Well, well, well.

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.159
Look who it is.

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.806
Dude, come on, don't do this.

01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:26.499
- Eeny...
- You stupid fuck!

01:17:26.609 --> 01:17:28.167
...meeny...
- What are you doing?

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:29.767
...miny...
- Please.

01:17:29.879 --> 01:17:31.642
...moe.
- Don't.

01:17:31.748 --> 01:17:34.739
- Catch a tiger...
- This isn't something you wanna do.

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:38.150
...by his toe.
- Please.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:40.587
If he hollers...

01:17:40.957 --> 01:17:44.257
- You're fuckin' sick. Don't do this.
...let him go.

01:17:44.361 --> 01:17:45.658
Eeny...

01:17:45.929 --> 01:17:47.260
meeny...

01:17:47.631 --> 01:17:48.928
