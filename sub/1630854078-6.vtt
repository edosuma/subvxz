00:01.754 --> 00:03.507
[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.591 --> 00:05.052
Our friendly's right there
in No Man's Land,

00:05.135 --> 00:06.095
but he can't get across.

00:06.221 --> 00:09.519
Everything we want to know
about Hannah is just there.

00:10.312 --> 00:11.147
I'm going across.

00:11.649 --> 00:12.734
I'm going with you.

00:13.026 --> 00:14.403
[guardian] I don't know
where the schools are.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.700
But everything
we do know is on here.

00:17.661 --> 00:19.080
[Commander Putnam]
This new grand plan of yours.

00:19.163 --> 00:19.998
What are you calling it?

00:20.082 --> 00:21.042
New Bethlehem.

00:21.125 --> 00:24.800
The other Commanders
will never support that.

00:25.342 --> 00:26.595
[Aunt Lydia]
I should've listened to you.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.808
I want to do things differently.

00:29.225 --> 00:31.062
I want to address any problem...

00:31.312 --> 00:32.189
With more...

00:32.941 --> 00:33.985
compassion.

00:34.778 --> 00:36.239
[all laughing softly]

00:36.532 --> 00:38.703
Well, I was hoping that I could
get back to the Center and

00:38.786 --> 00:39.663
settle in and start work.

00:39.746 --> 00:43.086
We-- We have many good people
already in place.

00:43.546 --> 00:45.550
Most pregnancies
do end in bedrest.

00:46.009 --> 00:49.098
Your baby's needs come ahead
of any plans or ambitions.

00:49.348 --> 00:50.977
[guardian] This way's a lot
quicker back to the border.

00:51.060 --> 00:52.438
-[clicks]
-Stop.

00:53.816 --> 00:54.776
They're-- They're--

00:56.487 --> 00:57.532
[groaning]

00:58.701 --> 00:59.619
[guardian] Go.

01:00.412 --> 01:01.456
-We have to go.
-You go.

01:01.540 --> 01:02.542
Come on, come on.
It's right there.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.544
We can make it.

01:09.472 --> 01:10.516
[June] No!

01:10.683 --> 01:11.685
[screams]

01:39.658 --> 01:41.620
[breathing deeply]

01:47.590 --> 01:48.551
Hold on.

01:51.055 --> 01:53.978
Hey, hey. Hey. Stop. Don't.

01:54.813 --> 01:56.525
[Luke grunts]

01:58.821 --> 01:59.990
You can't break them.

02:00.616 --> 02:01.660
Luke, you can't.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.290
Maybe one,
but you can't break two.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.377
[groans]

02:06.837 --> 02:07.881
[exhales]

02:12.389 --> 02:13.517
Are they Gilead?

02:13.601 --> 02:14.686
Hmm?

02:14.936 --> 02:16.189
No, I don't think so.

02:16.899 --> 02:17.859
It's the smell.

02:18.318 --> 02:20.322
It's some sort of disinfectant,
it's too many chemicals.

02:20.405 --> 02:21.909
It's way too unhealthy for them.

02:23.913 --> 02:25.373
Oh, Jesus.

02:26.209 --> 02:27.252
[exhales]

02:27.504 --> 02:29.381
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[groans]

02:29.465 --> 02:30.510
Just breathe. It's okay.

02:36.605 --> 02:37.649
[door slams]

02:39.443 --> 02:40.445
[exhales]

02:40.988 --> 02:42.951
Okay. All right.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.123
I gotta...

02:47.376 --> 02:48.253
[agent 1] Are we good?

02:48.336 --> 02:50.173
[agent 2] Yeah. It's just two
of them. Let's get it done.

02:52.929 --> 02:54.891
Let's go. Get out. Come on!

02:57.020 --> 02:58.858
Let's go! Now!

03:15.891 --> 03:16.810
[Butler] Turn.

03:22.655 --> 03:23.741
All right. Move him out.

03:32.675 --> 03:33.636
[Butler] Turn.

03:40.608 --> 03:41.985
Are you gonna tell us
who you are?

03:45.951 --> 03:47.454
We're still in
No Man's Land, right?

03:47.538 --> 03:49.333
What is this,
some sort of transit hub?

03:50.920 --> 03:51.922
I got it.

03:52.172 --> 03:53.007
Where are you taking us?

03:53.091 --> 03:54.761
[Luke] We're refugees,
all right?

03:54.844 --> 03:56.263
We got asylum in Canada.

03:56.807 --> 03:58.226
There are people you can call

03:58.309 --> 04:00.021
who will confirm
who we are. Okay?

04:00.105 --> 04:01.023
[Butler] What's your name?

04:05.991 --> 04:07.035
June Osborn.

04:07.202 --> 04:09.916
No, your ear tag.

04:10.668 --> 04:11.795
Tell me who you're Of?

04:13.674 --> 04:14.759
Nobody.

04:15.553 --> 04:16.429
Fuck you.

04:16.513 --> 04:17.724
Okay, take 'em away.

04:18.182 --> 04:19.143
Him too. Move.

04:19.226 --> 04:20.061
[agent 2] Come on.

04:35.216 --> 04:36.385
Oh. Dr. Landers?

04:36.553 --> 04:38.473
Blessed Day, Mrs. Waterford.

04:38.849 --> 04:41.020
Uh, I'm sorry,
I must have misunderstood.

04:41.103 --> 04:44.527
I thought that my ultrasound
exam was this morning.

04:44.944 --> 04:47.867
It is. But we don't
have to go anywhere.

04:48.994 --> 04:50.038
We don't?

05:29.449 --> 05:32.665
Isn't it incredible?
It's a full birthing suite.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.130
Uh, yes, it's incredible.

05:37.132 --> 05:39.261
I had no idea
that this was up here.

05:39.679 --> 05:41.975
It's much nicer than what we
have at my office in the city,

05:42.058 --> 05:43.019
I can tell you.

05:44.438 --> 05:46.985
And the Wheelers
arranged all of this?

05:47.653 --> 05:50.199
Yeah, as soon as they knew
you might be staying.

05:50.868 --> 05:51.745
[chuckles softly]

05:52.454 --> 05:53.456
Just for me.

05:54.626 --> 05:55.836
[Dr. Landers]
They feel it's safer.

05:56.796 --> 05:58.717
It's overcautious, I know.

05:58.800 --> 06:01.180
But they understand
how valuable you are.

06:01.263 --> 06:02.683
How, how special.

06:04.436 --> 06:05.355
How kind.

06:05.898 --> 06:06.816
[Dr. Landers] Let's, uh...

06:08.194 --> 06:09.822
we'll do the ultrasound first,

06:10.281 --> 06:12.995
and then, if you don't mind,
I'll just take a quick peek.

06:15.668 --> 06:16.711
Of course.

06:25.604 --> 06:26.648
Oh.

06:27.190 --> 06:28.317
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

06:38.295 --> 06:40.216
So you are at the place
right now

06:40.466 --> 06:41.928
where perineal massage

06:42.012 --> 06:44.141
is gonna start being
very effective for you.

06:47.063 --> 06:48.608
Tearing is no picnic so,

06:50.278 --> 06:52.742
anything to get that tissue
more flexible

06:52.825 --> 06:55.079
will have great benefits for you
when the time comes.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.670
Avoid the gels,

06:58.754 --> 07:02.803
just stick with essential oils,
witch hazel, that sort of thing.

07:02.887 --> 07:04.056
They have it all stocked here.

07:06.060 --> 07:07.062
Thank you, Doctor.

07:11.111 --> 07:12.615
Uh...

07:13.199 --> 07:14.535
your blood pressure,

07:15.078 --> 07:17.708
it's the one pesky thing.
It's higher than I'd like.

07:18.292 --> 07:19.127
Oh, I...

07:19.587 --> 07:21.298
I'm probably just excited.

07:21.841 --> 07:22.802
Of course you are.

07:23.512 --> 07:26.266
But I'd really like you to
try and slow things down

07:26.350 --> 07:27.268
over the next few weeks.

07:27.812 --> 07:31.569
The more time you could stay
at home, resting, the better.

07:32.362 --> 07:35.201
-I'll do my best.
-Ah! Forgot those.

07:35.326 --> 07:36.245
Oh.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.710
Um...

07:44.427 --> 07:45.471
Is everything okay?

07:48.394 --> 07:49.271
Most definitely.

07:51.693 --> 07:53.028
I was just wondering...

07:54.574 --> 07:57.120
I, of course, have spoken to
Ryan and Alanis about this,

07:57.538 --> 07:59.834
who encouraged me.
[chuckles nervously]

08:01.128 --> 08:02.798
Encouraged you to do what?

08:03.842 --> 08:06.848
To ask if you would like to
have dinner with me...

08:07.933 --> 08:08.977
Serena.

08:12.526 --> 08:13.485
Dinner?

08:13.778 --> 08:15.156
I mean,
we could either stay here

08:15.239 --> 08:16.826
or I could host you at my house.

08:17.620 --> 08:20.124
I am an embarrassing cook,

08:20.751 --> 08:23.214
but my Martha makes
a delicious cedar salmon.

08:23.422 --> 08:24.341
Does she?

08:26.763 --> 08:28.892
I know we don't know
each other well right now,

08:29.309 --> 08:31.104
but I would like to change that.

08:32.691 --> 08:33.777
And what I do know...

08:35.697 --> 08:37.576
is just that
I really admire you.

08:42.377 --> 08:46.009
Well, uh, it's an interesting
proposal, Dr. Landers.

08:47.638 --> 08:48.556
Alan.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.560
Alan.

08:54.025 --> 08:55.737
[exhales deeply]

09:00.664 --> 09:03.545
Doctor. I've been told
the procedure was canceled?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.799
Esther's uterus harvesting?

09:05.966 --> 09:07.595
Yes, thank you for coming.

09:08.555 --> 09:09.472
Oh... [sighs]

09:10.141 --> 09:11.561
It's so unfortunate.

09:12.395 --> 09:15.318
Tragedy just seems
to follow that poor soul.

09:15.986 --> 09:17.948
Well, happily, not today.

09:18.032 --> 09:19.827
We stopped the procedure
when we found

09:19.910 --> 09:21.873
the Handmaid had been filled
with His divine light.

09:22.833 --> 09:23.960
Praise be His mercy.

09:27.216 --> 09:29.179
-She's pregnant?
-Three weeks along.

09:30.139 --> 09:32.268
I hadn't realized
she'd been posted yet.

09:33.020 --> 09:33.938
Praise be.

09:38.155 --> 09:39.157
Praise be.

09:39.366 --> 09:40.911
Now, she'll be transferred

09:40.994 --> 09:43.583
to the high-risk obstetrics
hospital this afternoon,

09:43.667 --> 09:46.463
and she'll be there,
on bedrest, until term.

09:46.839 --> 09:47.841
Right.

09:48.802 --> 09:51.056
She's awake now
if you'd like to see her.

09:53.102 --> 09:54.980
I would like that, very much.

10:01.994 --> 10:02.996
[clears throat]

10:04.917 --> 10:05.877
[sighs]

10:17.776 --> 10:19.320
Blessed Day, Esther.

10:22.243 --> 10:23.538
Blessed Day, Aunt Lydia.

10:24.665 --> 10:25.751
[clears throat]

10:26.126 --> 10:27.921
[shushes] It's all right.

10:32.096 --> 10:32.973
Here, dear.

10:34.476 --> 10:35.436
Here now.

10:37.273 --> 10:38.317
All right.

10:47.084 --> 10:50.466
I've just heard this morning's
surprising news.

10:54.683 --> 10:59.067
I wonder if you could help me to
get to the bottom of something.

11:01.154 --> 11:02.240
Three weeks ago,

11:02.323 --> 11:05.162
that was
Commander Waterford's funeral,

11:06.373 --> 11:07.291
was it not?

11:11.049 --> 11:12.426
You remember that, don't you?

11:17.855 --> 11:18.815
Mmm-hmm.

11:19.650 --> 11:20.652
Now,

11:22.363 --> 11:23.825
I want you to be honest with me.

11:26.288 --> 11:27.164
Do you understand me?

11:29.252 --> 11:30.797
Esther, do you understand?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.095
Yes, Aunt Lydia.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.397
On the day of the funeral,

11:41.067 --> 11:44.407
you had a private audience
with Commander Putnam.

11:50.754 --> 11:52.214
Now you can tell me the truth.

11:53.885 --> 11:56.222
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

12:02.611 --> 12:03.821
I need to ask you...

12:08.915 --> 12:11.837
did you behave
in a way that might have,

12:12.923 --> 12:14.551
even unwittingly,

12:17.390 --> 12:18.976
invited his attention?

12:21.691 --> 12:22.609
No.

12:25.657 --> 12:28.120
God knows our...our truths.

12:33.463 --> 12:34.591
I didn't do anything.

12:39.518 --> 12:40.477
He raped me.

12:49.495 --> 12:50.372
[exhales]

12:51.834 --> 12:53.003
That's terrible!

12:57.261 --> 12:58.305
That's terrible!

13:00.225 --> 13:01.102
Oh...

13:02.229 --> 13:03.398
I'm sorry, dear.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.112
I'm sorry.

13:08.618 --> 13:09.661
No, you're not.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.335
I'm what, hon... I--

13:14.045 --> 13:15.088
-What--
-[Esther] They all do it.

13:16.717 --> 13:17.719
You know they do.

13:19.807 --> 13:20.892
You're not sorry.

13:22.562 --> 13:23.773
[swallows]

13:25.442 --> 13:26.779
I think what you need now

13:28.783 --> 13:29.785
is rest, dear,

13:31.079 --> 13:33.208
because you're very tired
and you...

13:34.586 --> 13:35.713
you need to rest

13:36.924 --> 13:37.843
because you have, you have--

13:38.426 --> 13:39.345
Get off me!

13:39.596 --> 13:40.430
Take a rest, dear.

13:40.557 --> 13:42.059
Don't fucking touch me!

13:42.143 --> 13:43.521
-No, no.
-Get out!

13:44.063 --> 13:45.440
-Get out!
-No, Esther!

13:45.775 --> 13:47.779
Get out!

13:47.863 --> 13:48.948
[Aunt Lydia] Help me! Help me!

13:49.031 --> 13:50.827
[screaming]

13:50.910 --> 13:53.498
No, no. Help me! Help me!

13:55.210 --> 13:56.421
[screaming]

14:20.302 --> 14:21.429
Commander Putnam?

14:22.891 --> 14:23.809
That's right.

14:25.563 --> 14:28.485
Do you dispute any of the facts
as I have laid them out for you?

14:28.569 --> 14:31.407
No, no, it all sounds
very likely.

14:32.911 --> 14:34.831
Then you agree
that Commander Putnam

14:35.207 --> 14:36.334
needs to be punished.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.171
[Lawrence] For what crime?

14:40.927 --> 14:42.096
He got her pregnant

14:43.599 --> 14:46.312
a day before she was posted.

14:46.522 --> 14:50.947
Enlighten me, Lydia,
where's the sin here?

14:52.867 --> 14:54.412
He violated that girl.

14:55.288 --> 14:56.249
Technically.

14:57.084 --> 14:58.879
The Ceremony is sacred.

14:59.255 --> 15:00.800
It is blessed by God.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.846
Oh. Right.

15:02.929 --> 15:04.223
[chuckles]

15:05.434 --> 15:07.396
You mock God's name?

15:08.481 --> 15:10.318
And you defend a rapist?

15:13.617 --> 15:14.745
One day, Commander,

15:16.122 --> 15:17.458
there will be justice.

15:18.961 --> 15:19.963
Watch your tone.

15:23.428 --> 15:24.472
Watch it, Lydia.

15:26.810 --> 15:27.979
Forgetting yourself.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.494
Thank you.

15:37.707 --> 15:39.043
Given me a lot to think about.

15:40.671 --> 15:42.007
You're welcome, Commander.

15:44.345 --> 15:45.890
And I will leave you to it.

15:58.874 --> 15:59.918
[Luke] Bullshit.

16:00.628 --> 16:03.843
I mean, if they're not Gilead,
then who are they?

16:03.926 --> 16:05.303
We were out there for two day--

16:05.387 --> 16:08.226
Like... Moira's gonna be losing
her shit right now, right?

16:08.811 --> 16:10.982
I mean, she could be the one
that gets Mayday.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.571
Now, Mayday
aren't gonna come, right?

16:14.071 --> 16:15.448
Mayday aren't comin', right?

16:16.743 --> 16:17.745
I don't know.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.085
Yeah.

16:23.298 --> 16:24.593
-Why don't you sit down?
-Huh?

16:25.595 --> 16:26.513
I need you to sit down.

16:27.389 --> 16:30.478
I'm-I'm-I'm tryin' to figure--
Why do you want me to sit down?

16:30.980 --> 16:33.026
Panic, it wastes the energy.
Sit down.

16:33.527 --> 16:34.361
I'm not panicking.

16:34.445 --> 16:35.740
I'm tryin' to figure out
how to get us out

16:35.823 --> 16:36.867
and how to get you outta here.

16:36.950 --> 16:39.371
Like, I'm, I-I-I'm sorry I'm
being such a man about it.

16:39.455 --> 16:41.459
I'm sorry that I'm... you know,
but I'm just tryin' to,

16:41.543 --> 16:43.463
like, you,
you've been in this...

16:43.547 --> 16:46.302
How many times have you
been in this situation? Huh?

16:47.387 --> 16:48.223
A few.

16:49.099 --> 16:51.187
Crazy. A few fuckin' times.

16:54.986 --> 16:58.201
Honestly, sometimes the box is
a lot smaller than this, so...

16:58.493 --> 17:00.581
That's crazy!

17:00.915 --> 17:02.543
That's-- That is insane!

17:02.919 --> 17:04.589
Like thinkin' about you here

17:04.673 --> 17:06.802
and you gotta get help from
wherever you gotta get help from

17:06.885 --> 17:08.597
like that's just not fair.
Like, you deserve--

17:08.681 --> 17:09.557
Luke!

17:11.687 --> 17:12.522
Stop.

17:14.024 --> 17:15.151
Please, stop.

17:18.534 --> 17:19.410
[sighs]

17:20.328 --> 17:21.247
'Kay?

17:23.209 --> 17:24.086
Please.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.062
I survived.

17:34.816 --> 17:35.776
Right?

17:37.530 --> 17:38.532
I survived.

17:41.162 --> 17:42.039
So, just...

17:51.349 --> 17:52.434
Stop.

17:56.610 --> 17:57.570
I'm sorry.

17:59.198 --> 18:00.075
It's okay.

18:01.327 --> 18:02.664
I'm sorry. Sorry. I just...

18:04.793 --> 18:07.590
it's just when I... When I think
of you in places like this,

18:08.466 --> 18:09.468
by yourself,

18:10.846 --> 18:11.807
I just wish...

18:15.146 --> 18:17.234
I wish I could've
been the kinda guy

18:17.944 --> 18:19.196
that could've come and got ya.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.035
And I know how that sounds,
I just...

18:23.079 --> 18:23.997
I just wish

18:25.333 --> 18:28.256
I could've been with you
through that.

18:32.557 --> 18:33.600
You were with me.

18:37.149 --> 18:38.025
You were.

18:54.057 --> 18:54.934
All right.

19:14.641 --> 19:16.895
I just love that the more
you cut back some flowers,

19:16.978 --> 19:17.980
the more they bloom.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.820
I used to spend hours
in my greenhouse

19:20.903 --> 19:23.449
reminding myself that pruning
encourages life.

19:24.451 --> 19:25.286
I love that.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.046
You know, I, uh...

19:30.506 --> 19:32.175
I found Dr. Landers

19:32.259 --> 19:36.058
to be quite the gentleman
this morning, and so kind.

19:36.726 --> 19:39.022
Oh, I'm so glad you agree.

19:39.732 --> 19:41.360
You know,
he's really such a catch.

19:41.695 --> 19:43.364
He was just appointed
to the head of Obstetrics

19:43.447 --> 19:45.326
at the University of Toronto,
did he mention that?

19:45.493 --> 19:47.455
No, but he asked me to dinner.

19:48.374 --> 19:51.005
He did? Oh, wonderful.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.011
I'm not sure that I agree.

19:54.596 --> 19:55.639
But why?

19:55.723 --> 19:58.477
I mean, surely this is evidence
of God's great blessing.

19:59.897 --> 20:01.442
I mean, he's nice and everything

20:01.526 --> 20:03.029
but I'm not gonna
date my gynecologist.

20:04.406 --> 20:05.909
I may not even choose
to get married

20:05.993 --> 20:07.162
in the near future, at all.

20:09.082 --> 20:11.378
It's not actually Gilead, is it?

20:12.548 --> 20:13.842
You can't be a single mother.

20:15.011 --> 20:16.556
I'm not. I'm a widow.

20:17.057 --> 20:20.689
Your baby needs
a mother and a father,

20:21.357 --> 20:22.693
and that's more important
than your feelings.

20:28.371 --> 20:29.707
I think I need a break
from the flowers.

20:30.124 --> 20:31.126
Where are you going?

20:32.128 --> 20:33.255
I'm going for a walk.

20:33.965 --> 20:35.468
Well, no, it's too cold.

20:35.803 --> 20:37.347
And Dr. Landers said
you need to rest.

20:37.515 --> 20:38.934
Perhaps we need to
organize a conversation

20:39.226 --> 20:40.771
between you
and Commander Lawrence--

20:40.854 --> 20:42.190
Absolutely not.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.779
You need to rest.
Your baby needs to rest.

20:45.279 --> 20:46.365
That's final.

20:51.918 --> 20:52.837
Alanis.

20:54.423 --> 20:55.466
Go to your room.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.811
[sobbing]

21:57.215 --> 21:59.094
[water dripping]

22:08.153 --> 22:09.156
-Hey.
-Hmm?

22:10.951 --> 22:11.870
How's it goin'?

22:13.080 --> 22:14.457
I'm actually doing pretty good.

22:15.293 --> 22:16.169
Good.

22:16.546 --> 22:19.384
Yeah, I mean considering,
you know.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.679
How are you doin'?

22:20.846 --> 22:22.015
How's your... How's your butt?

22:22.766 --> 22:23.935
You talkin' 'bout my butt?

22:24.019 --> 22:24.937
Yeah.

22:25.814 --> 22:27.358
-How is it?
-It's really good, thanks.

22:27.735 --> 22:29.989
-It looks good.
-[both laugh]

22:32.578 --> 22:35.458
I mean, I'm just sayin'.
You're lucky there's a cage.

22:35.667 --> 22:36.836
[laughing]

22:36.920 --> 22:38.130
[Luke] And armed guards.

22:38.255 --> 22:39.341
'Cause otherwise...

22:40.969 --> 22:41.804
You know what?

22:41.888 --> 22:43.892
I'm kind of starting
to really like this place.

22:43.975 --> 22:47.065
You know, tall ceilings
and natural light.

22:47.148 --> 22:48.275
That kind of loft feel?

22:48.359 --> 22:49.402
[June] Yeah.
It's growin' on you?

22:50.237 --> 22:52.033
I'm wondering if it's on Airbnb.

22:55.666 --> 22:56.542
Housekeeping.

22:56.960 --> 22:57.795
[agent] Get up.

23:07.272 --> 23:08.148
Hands up.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.403
[Luke] All right, all right,
easy, easy.

23:15.246 --> 23:16.791
Are you taking us back
to Gilead?

23:17.083 --> 23:18.503
[agent] Yeah. Yeah,
we're taking you to Gilead.

23:18.837 --> 23:19.880
You listen to me.

23:19.964 --> 23:22.803
You tell your boss he has to
call Commander Lawrence

23:22.886 --> 23:24.682
or Commander Blaine.
Do you understand me?

23:25.224 --> 23:26.059
[man grunts]

23:26.143 --> 23:28.022
-Hey! What the fuck, man?
-[June] Fuck.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.401
-You okay?
-Luke, I'm okay.

23:31.486 --> 23:32.405
June.

23:32.531 --> 23:33.950
Just do what they say. Okay?

23:34.577 --> 23:35.537
Luke.

23:35.704 --> 23:36.664
Turn the fuck around.

23:36.748 --> 23:37.958
All right, dude, no problem.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.839
[June] Luke, no! Fuck!

23:40.922 --> 23:41.883
[men grunting]

23:41.966 --> 23:44.095
Don't fight them, Luke!
Don't! Don't hurt him!

23:44.972 --> 23:45.849
Luke, don't fight them!

23:47.143 --> 23:48.228
[Luke] All right, all right.

23:48.312 --> 23:49.899
-[June] He's not fighting you!
-All right, I'll stop!

23:50.024 --> 23:50.859
[grunts]

23:50.942 --> 23:52.988
Luke! Hey! Hey! Stop!

23:53.072 --> 23:53.948
What are you doing?

23:54.449 --> 23:55.577
He's not fighting you!

23:56.286 --> 23:58.040
Stop it!
He's not fucking fighting you!

23:58.248 --> 24:00.211
-Stop resisting!
-He's not fucking resisting!

24:00.294 --> 24:01.964
-Get back!
-He's not resisting!

24:02.215 --> 24:05.262
Let go of him! Let go! Stop it!

24:06.223 --> 24:07.225
[Luke gasps]

24:07.601 --> 24:09.270
Fuck is wrong with you?

24:12.694 --> 24:15.074
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

24:15.826 --> 24:17.161
The fuck is wrong with you?

24:18.915 --> 24:20.710
Where are you taking him?
Where are you taking him?

24:26.639 --> 24:27.683
[coughing]

24:29.394 --> 24:30.564
It's okay, Luke.

24:32.943 --> 24:33.945
You're okay.

24:35.824 --> 24:37.493
What the fuck is wrong with you?

24:37.828 --> 24:39.080
You fucking animals!

24:41.544 --> 24:43.590
It's okay. Baby, you're okay.

24:44.299 --> 24:46.344
You're okay.
Just try to breathe.

24:46.762 --> 24:48.600
Luke, you're okay.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.653
[Lawrence] You're a bull
in the field, Warren.

24:55.029 --> 24:57.868
You're gonna singlehandedly
repopulate the planet.

24:58.035 --> 24:59.663
[Commander Putnam]
Wouldn't that be something.

24:59.872 --> 25:00.707
Praise be.

25:00.790 --> 25:01.918
[Nick] Yes, praise be.

25:06.301 --> 25:10.309
And to think that such a quick

25:11.854 --> 25:13.023
and impulsive act

25:13.273 --> 25:15.820
could have such huge
political implications.

25:17.323 --> 25:21.081
Well, not so quick,
but, uh, yes.

25:22.500 --> 25:23.836
You of course understand

25:23.920 --> 25:27.093
that your plans for
New Bethlehem are dead.

25:29.097 --> 25:30.517
I know you don't see it yet,

25:30.600 --> 25:32.688
but, uh,
it's what's best for Gilead.

25:34.065 --> 25:34.984
Be a good sport about it

25:35.067 --> 25:36.529
in front of the other Commanders
won't you, Lawrence?

25:36.946 --> 25:38.115
[Lawrence] Oh, absolutely.

25:38.533 --> 25:42.081
It's a good example
for young Commander Blaine,

25:42.791 --> 25:44.460
accept when
you've been outplayed.

25:45.839 --> 25:47.174
I'm learning a lot
from the both of you.

25:48.468 --> 25:49.429
Now, wait now.

25:49.847 --> 25:51.266
I didn't do this to her
with any thought

25:51.349 --> 25:53.521
of how a baby
could impact my stature.

25:54.606 --> 25:56.318
It feels like
an even greater blessing

25:57.779 --> 26:01.829
I always took you for
more of a Jezebels' man,

26:02.539 --> 26:07.381
less of a quickie behind a desk
before a funeral kinda guy.

26:07.924 --> 26:08.843
[Commander Putnam] I'm surprised

26:08.926 --> 26:10.680
you have the capacity
to imagine either,

26:11.724 --> 26:13.352
given your pious lack of

26:15.064 --> 26:16.692
action on the subject.

26:18.487 --> 26:21.952
I'm just too busy thinking about
the future, Warren.

26:24.875 --> 26:25.752
You know, I just wonder,

26:25.835 --> 26:27.881
if you never allow yourself
to enjoy the spoils

26:27.964 --> 26:29.008
of your position,

26:30.302 --> 26:31.639
why seek it in the first place?

26:32.139 --> 26:33.058
[scoffs]

27:20.319 --> 27:21.237
Thank you, Ezra.

27:27.041 --> 27:28.293
Good evening Mr. Wheeler.

27:29.588 --> 27:30.548
You asked to see me?

27:31.800 --> 27:33.763
Yes. Good evening.

27:36.309 --> 27:38.940
Is this about the conversation
I had with your wife earlier?

27:39.273 --> 27:41.486
[chuckles] No.

27:42.531 --> 27:45.160
No. She mentioned that,
uh, the two of you had

27:45.828 --> 27:49.628
words, but I trust that
you two will work things out.

27:51.005 --> 27:52.509
Yes, I suppose we will.

27:55.472 --> 27:56.307
Please.

28:15.053 --> 28:16.515
No, um...

28:19.730 --> 28:21.024
I wanted to see you

28:23.153 --> 28:24.071
because

28:26.367 --> 28:28.873
June Osborn
was apprehended today

28:30.668 --> 28:32.547
by one of my teams
in No Man's Land.

28:39.853 --> 28:41.105
Are you're sure it's her?

28:44.362 --> 28:46.659
Yes, it's fully verified.

28:47.577 --> 28:48.954
She's traveling
with her husband.

28:51.334 --> 28:55.425
You don't ever have to
worry about them ever again.

28:57.847 --> 28:58.849
Now you can just...

29:00.102 --> 29:01.772
You can just focus on your baby.

29:09.286 --> 29:10.748
What's gonna happen to her?

29:14.840 --> 29:15.842
I'm...

29:17.469 --> 29:19.725
I'm going to send Ezra
to No Man's Land

29:21.144 --> 29:22.981
and have him
deal with her there.

29:29.326 --> 29:30.830
Like what she did to Fred?

29:42.520 --> 29:43.856
Of course,
I could send her to Gilead,

29:44.816 --> 29:46.277
like I do with the others,

29:47.989 --> 29:50.452
but I just don't trust
that they will actually

29:51.370 --> 29:52.957
deal with her properly.

29:54.753 --> 29:55.671
No.

29:56.757 --> 29:57.592
Of course not.

30:00.013 --> 30:02.142
She has too many
sympathizers there.

30:03.854 --> 30:05.482
Well, they can't save her
this time.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.134
I want to go with Ezra.

30:22.349 --> 30:24.270
No, not in your condition.

30:26.107 --> 30:28.069
I don't... I don't think
it's a good idea.

30:29.698 --> 30:30.700
Please.

30:33.622 --> 30:34.666
I'll be fine.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.591
I need to go.

30:42.222 --> 30:43.266
You want to see it?

30:50.363 --> 30:51.449
Bear witness.

30:58.547 --> 31:00.425
She's taken so much
away from me.

31:00.509 --> 31:03.056
I need to see it.
I need to see the end.

31:06.855 --> 31:07.899
I want to tell my son

31:07.982 --> 31:10.195
that I know what happened
to his father's killer.

31:12.491 --> 31:13.827
That she's gone from the Earth.

31:22.386 --> 31:23.346
All right,

31:25.183 --> 31:26.143
you may go.

31:31.404 --> 31:32.364
Thank you.

31:34.786 --> 31:36.873
Thank you. In God's grace.

31:53.239 --> 31:54.158
[June] Luke?

31:56.705 --> 31:57.707
You okay?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.378
Are you okay?

32:03.635 --> 32:04.554
I'm right here.

32:07.267 --> 32:08.227
I'm right here.

32:14.031 --> 32:14.866
I'm sorry.

32:19.249 --> 32:20.210
I'm really sorry.

32:21.045 --> 32:22.089
June, stop.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.019
You didn't know how bad
it could be, and I...

32:30.355 --> 32:31.190
I did.

32:35.908 --> 32:36.868
I should've told you.

32:36.952 --> 32:41.377
I shouldn't have let you
come to No Man's Land.

32:41.503 --> 32:43.172
I should've stopped you.
I should...

32:44.091 --> 32:45.426
I'm just sorry.

32:46.262 --> 32:48.224
'Cause it's my fault,
what happened, so...

32:50.521 --> 32:51.815
You don't get to say that.

32:55.739 --> 32:57.075
I decided to be here.

32:58.327 --> 32:59.204
I decided that.

33:02.837 --> 33:03.922

33:29.014 --> 33:29.891
Last time...

33:33.982 --> 33:36.320
Last time we didn't
get to say goodbye.

33:37.740 --> 33:39.535
And I don't want that
to happen again.

33:42.583 --> 33:43.417
No.

33:47.467 --> 33:48.386
Fuck that.

33:51.183 --> 33:52.185
Why?

33:52.853 --> 33:54.356
Because we're gonna stay alive.

33:55.985 --> 33:58.239
June, when we get to Gilead,

33:58.322 --> 34:00.076
they're gonna execute us,
all right?

34:07.675 --> 34:08.677
Okay.

34:12.434 --> 34:14.354
You listen to me, okay?

34:16.108 --> 34:17.027
Okay.

34:18.070 --> 34:18.905
Okay.

34:20.325 --> 34:22.329
Last time when we were apart...

34:28.215 --> 34:29.677
No matter what happened,

34:33.309 --> 34:36.566
I never gave up hope.

34:42.661 --> 34:44.289
And you never gave up hope,

34:48.757 --> 34:50.426
because we knew...

34:54.184 --> 34:55.646
we just knew...

34:58.902 --> 35:00.739
that we would
find each other again.

35:05.541 --> 35:06.584
So,

35:08.630 --> 35:10.509
we're just gonna do that again.

35:12.387 --> 35:13.347
Right?

35:18.357 --> 35:19.359
I love you.

35:22.282 --> 35:23.618
I love you.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.463
And we are gonna do that again.

35:31.718 --> 35:32.845
Do you understand?

35:34.849 --> 35:35.851
Yeah, we're...

35:36.895 --> 35:38.607
-we're gonna stay alive.

36:07.873 --> 36:09.710
Even if it is
the slightest discomfort,

36:09.794 --> 36:11.965
Ezra will
bring you home immediately.

36:12.675 --> 36:13.760
Oh, I know.

36:16.098 --> 36:17.058
Thank you.

37:19.182 --> 37:20.309

37:20.393 --> 37:21.938
They don't want him. Dump 'im.

-No, no, no.
-What?

37:23.023 --> 37:23.858
[Luke]
No, we stay together!

No, no! Where are you
taking him? No!

Where are they taking him?

37:47.740 --> 37:49.577
Tell me!
Where are they taking him?

No matter how many times you've
thought about your own death,

38:31.536 --> 38:34.708
I don't think it happens
exactly the way you expect.

38:36.419 --> 38:37.923
There's always a curve ball.

38:38.382 --> 38:41.096
some strategy
you didn't fully think through.

38:44.143 --> 38:46.189
An enemy you didn't see in time.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.072
No matter what you do,

38:50.866 --> 38:52.703
the end is always a surprise.

Oh, I'm sure
word has gotten around.

39:50.109 --> 39:50.986
Why?

39:51.946 --> 39:52.823
What did you do?

39:55.160 --> 39:57.248
Something you will be
thanking me for.

Commander Warren Putnam,

40:13.740 --> 40:14.825
you are to come with us.

40:15.284 --> 40:16.494
What on earth
could be so important

40:16.579 --> 40:18.624
that you need to disturb me
in the middle of breakfast?

40:20.461 --> 40:21.547
Get your hands off me!

40:21.630 --> 40:22.716
Wait! Warren?

40:22.799 --> 40:24.427
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

40:24.511 --> 40:26.807
Yes, yes. Okay, I am...
I'm walking!

40:27.224 --> 40:28.143
Fine, I can walk.

The High Criminal Court
of Gilead,

40:48.350 --> 40:50.229
in a special overnight session,

40:50.312 --> 40:51.899
found you, Commander Putnam,

40:51.982 --> 40:54.655
guilty of apostasy,

40:55.447 --> 40:56.659
sins of the flesh.

40:58.495 --> 40:59.790
[Commander Putnam]
That's insanity!

41:01.042 --> 41:02.086
For what?

41:04.215 --> 41:06.177
The rape of unassigned property.

41:07.681 --> 41:09.100
She's my Handmaid!

41:10.687 --> 41:12.481
She belongs to me!

41:13.150 --> 41:15.864
The eyes of the Lord
are everywhere.

Keep watch on the wicked
and the good.

what's going on?

You already know.

You shouldn't be worrying
about Lawrence or Putnam

42:41.994 --> 42:42.954
or any of that stuff.

42:43.204 --> 42:44.206

this makes me.

It makes me the kind of person
who will do whatever it takes

to make Gilead
a safer place for our child.

43:33.263 --> 43:35.142
Are you sure
that's who you did this for?

Take a long look, girls!

44:10.546 --> 44:11.924
In Gilead,

there are consequences
for disobeying God

44:17.685 --> 44:18.938
no matter who you are.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.152
You are holy vessels

44:23.112 --> 44:26.118
and, by His word,
you will be protected.

Honor God

44:30.001 --> 44:31.254
and, in return,

44:32.422 --> 44:33.634
you shall be honored.

44:37.391 --> 44:40.146
Commander Putnam
was an evil man.

44:41.525 --> 44:44.739
He took advantage
of his position.

This was justice.

Who are you?

Are you fucking serious?

46:42.850 --> 46:43.769
As serious as you were

when you told me you wanted
my baby to die inside of me.

of my fucking life.

So, what is this?

It's payback for Fred?

Okay.

Okay.
