00:01.262 --> 00:03.003
You know, I hate missing
my favorite show.

00:06.919 --> 00:08.617
Aah!

00:13.883 --> 00:14.840
Aah!

00:16.016 --> 00:17.234
Man: Who are you?

00:17.278 --> 00:19.410
We're the guys
who save the world.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.717
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, guys.

00:21.760 --> 00:23.849
Don't hurt her.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.113
Sam: You're married?
To a werewolf.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.680
Garth.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.900
You still think that
you're the hero of this story.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.423
Sam:
We'll take Chuck down.

00:32.467 --> 00:33.642
Exactly
what we're gonna do.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.600
Ohh!

00:35.644 --> 00:36.862
No.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.299
Oh, that was just
the beginning.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.866
No. This is...
the rest.

01:27.435 --> 01:29.393
Yeah!
Come on!

01:29.437 --> 01:33.005
Come on!

01:33.049 --> 01:34.137
Yeah!

01:34.181 --> 01:35.356
Yeah!

01:35.399 --> 01:38.228
Yeah!

01:38.272 --> 01:40.274
Yeah!

01:58.988 --> 02:00.903
Yeah!

03:45.050 --> 03:46.269
Oh!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.403
Hey, Teddy.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.665
Hey.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.057
What's new?

03:52.101 --> 03:54.364
Uh, my psoriasis is back.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.584
Oh.

$40.32.

04:09.901 --> 04:13.253
Um...right.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.341
There you go.

04:14.384 --> 04:17.692
Thank you.

04:22.523 --> 04:23.915
Oh.

04:23.959 --> 04:24.873
Oh, God.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.396
Okay.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.704
Aah!

04:32.402 --> 04:34.230
Uh, declined.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.319
What?
No, no, no, that's...

04:36.363 --> 04:38.060
No, that card's worked for
like five years.

04:38.103 --> 04:41.542
I -- Sorry.

04:41.585 --> 04:44.893
Aah!

04:44.936 --> 04:47.243
Wha--

04:47.287 --> 04:49.550
Seriously?

04:49.593 --> 04:52.422
Thanks, Teddy.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.642
Whoa!

04:54.685 --> 04:56.426
Seriously?!

05:01.388 --> 05:04.347
Seriously?

05:04.391 --> 05:06.697
Sammy!

05:06.741 --> 05:09.526
Sammy!

05:09.570 --> 05:12.137
Dean?

05:12.181 --> 05:13.443
Hey!

05:18.405 --> 05:19.754
Was that a trip?

05:19.797 --> 05:20.972
Yeah. Weird.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.234
There's a lotta that
goin' on.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.324
In town,
I just got a parking ticket.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.500
Because you always park in front
of that fire hydrant?

05:26.543 --> 05:27.805
No.

05:27.849 --> 05:29.807
I mean, yes.
Okay, I park there every time.

05:29.851 --> 05:31.374
I never get a ticket,
all right?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.550
Oh, and, uh...

05:33.594 --> 05:36.597
This...

05:36.640 --> 05:38.642
doesn't work.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.210
That's the card Charlie hacked
for us, the one --

05:41.253 --> 05:42.777
Yeah, the one that's supposed to
be our "no more hustling,

05:42.820 --> 05:44.387
always working"
Golden Ticket.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.997
Nothing.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.609
Weird.That's what I'm saying.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.394
Are you getting sick?

05:51.438 --> 05:52.656
I don't know.
Maybe.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.615
Oh, and --
and dinner's --

05:56.965 --> 05:58.749
Man, this day,
I'm telling you --

05:59.794 --> 06:01.970
What is next?

06:06.844 --> 06:08.411
It's Garth.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.327
Hey, Garth.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.547
Hey, Dean,
it's Garth.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.940
I, uh --
I need your help.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.601
I'm telling you, man,
we're cursed.

06:24.645 --> 06:27.082
We're not cursed, Dean.
We're just having a bad day.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.171
No. No, no, no. This is -- This
is more than just a no good,

06:29.214 --> 06:31.652
very bad day, okay?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.480
Chuck must've boned us
before he left, you know?

06:33.523 --> 06:35.699
Or maybe some of that crap
you brought back

06:35.743 --> 06:36.961
from Rowena's went sideways.

06:37.005 --> 06:38.223
'Cause this?
I mean...

06:38.267 --> 06:40.008
This is not normal.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.097
Oh.

06:42.140 --> 06:44.316
Oh. Gross.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.753
Dude...

06:45.796 --> 06:48.190
Sorry.
Look, just...

06:48.233 --> 06:50.366
Okay, listen.
Cass is in Heaven --

06:50.410 --> 06:52.499
seeing if they know where Chuck
went or anything.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.415
Oh, yeah, 'cause angels, they're
always really happy to help.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.286
And I'm sick,
and you got a ticket.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.767
It happens.
We'll deal, we --

06:59.810 --> 07:01.072
What's going on?

07:01.116 --> 07:02.639
What're you doing?
-I don't know.

07:06.382 --> 07:07.862
No, no, baby,
don't do this to me.

07:07.905 --> 07:09.124
Don't do this to me.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.474
No, no, no, no, no.
No, baby...

07:11.518 --> 07:12.606
Baby,
please don't do this.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.651
Seriously?
Oh, come on!

07:36.499 --> 07:38.762
Yeah. Normal.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.272
Garth:
Who's daddy's big boy?

08:10.315 --> 08:11.708
Here comes the airplane!

08:11.752 --> 08:14.842
Rrrrr!

08:17.061 --> 08:18.715
Come here.
Little bite.

08:18.759 --> 08:19.934
There we go, buddy.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.979
It's good.

08:22.023 --> 08:24.112
Isn't that so good?

08:24.155 --> 08:25.592
Hey, Sammy.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.550
Open wide.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.421
Here comes the airplane.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.076
Rrrrr.

08:32.120 --> 08:35.689
Oh, yeah, that's good stuff,
isn't it?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.998
You got me,
you little stinker.

08:41.042 --> 08:44.436
But Daddy was prepared
this time.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.004
Uh, Gertie?
Yeah.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.484
Can you watch the boys?Sure.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.573
Thank you.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.318
Is that them?It's gotta be.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.059
Hey!
There they are.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.756
Come in.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.890
Garth.
Hey, hey.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.152
Come here, you.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.806
Oh. Oh, I'm -- I'm sick.
Sorry.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.808
Oh.

09:07.851 --> 09:09.549
You -- Okay.

09:09.592 --> 09:10.767
Still a hugger, huh?

09:10.811 --> 09:12.377
You know it.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.944
You smell so good.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.511
And we're done.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.252
What took you guys
so long?

09:17.295 --> 09:18.688
We, uh --
W-We had to walk.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.385
Yeah, car broke down
about 10 miles back.

09:20.429 --> 09:22.083
I think it's the plugs.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.564
Really?Yeah, we're having
a super normal day.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.522
Okay. Well, no worries.
We'll fix you up.

09:26.566 --> 09:29.394
Daddy, the twins
are still hungry.

09:29.438 --> 09:30.613
Be right there, baby.

09:30.657 --> 09:32.136
Come on.
Come back and meet the kids.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.051
You've got more kids?Oh-ho-ho, yeah.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.401
Got a couple'a pups.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.881
So, this is
my daughter Gertie.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.623
Gertie,
say hi to Daddy's friends.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.494
-Hi.
-Hi.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.844
And these are the twins.

09:43.887 --> 09:46.324
This is Sam.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.675
I, uh, sorta named him
after you.

09:53.505 --> 09:55.203
Wow. That's, uh...

09:55.246 --> 09:56.726
Wow.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.510
That means
this one must be --

09:58.554 --> 10:01.078
Castiel.

10:01.122 --> 10:03.167
Yeah.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.475
Um --

10:06.518 --> 10:07.824
On the phone,
you said

10:07.868 --> 10:09.217
there was something wrong with
your cousin?

10:09.260 --> 10:10.435
Oh, not mine, Bess's.

10:10.479 --> 10:14.135
He's, uh -- Well...

10:14.178 --> 10:16.354
I think you should see
for yourself.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.661
Bess: I tried to wake him,
but he's in and out.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.793
He's hurt pretty bad.

10:19.836 --> 10:20.881
This dude's a werewolf?

10:20.924 --> 10:21.882
Pure blood, like me.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.361
Sam:
So what happened to him?

10:23.405 --> 10:25.059
We're not sure.
Cops found him down around

10:25.102 --> 10:27.931
St. Cloud, in Minnesota.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.977
Dean: Those look like
knife wounds.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.675
That's what the cops thought,
too, but they're not.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.417
They're from a wraith.

10:35.460 --> 10:38.028
Brad --
whoever did this to him

10:38.072 --> 10:40.291
thought he was dead,
and they dumped him in a swamp.

10:40.335 --> 10:43.120
But he somehow managed to
climb out,

10:43.164 --> 10:45.079
and the cops found his body by
the road.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.690
And Bess has been
looking after him, but...

10:47.734 --> 10:49.953
why would a wraith go after
a wolf?

10:49.997 --> 10:51.607
Hmm.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.087
When he comes to,
we'll ask him.

10:54.305 --> 10:56.090
Sonuva...

11:01.704 --> 11:03.053
Sorry.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.534
I'm, uh...
Sick. I know.

11:05.577 --> 11:08.102
Come with me.
I've got something for you.

11:11.583 --> 11:14.717
You know, I gotta say, aside
from pincushion in there...

11:14.761 --> 11:16.066
this is pretty nice.

11:16.110 --> 11:19.113
Yeah, better than
I ever thought I'd get.

11:19.156 --> 11:21.768
I mean, hunting -- I figured
I'd be dead before I'm 40.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.900
You know,
go out young and pretty.

11:23.944 --> 11:27.817
But now I've got a great wife,
great kids.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.864
I guess...
sometimes things work out.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.866
Yeah, sometimes.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.084
Good, man.
You deserve it.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.129
You do.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.435
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.741
What's up with
your teeth?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.308
What?
Your teeth.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.744
They hurt, right?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.050
A little.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.748
A lot.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.750
Since when?
Since yesterday.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.535
Mm.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.928
All right, come on.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.625
What?
Come on.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.410
What are we doing?

12:02.547 --> 12:05.159
Garth, what are we do--

12:05.202 --> 12:08.162
Oh, no.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.558
You know what?

12:13.602 --> 12:15.299
I'm good.

12:16.605 --> 12:18.128
Get in the chair, Dean.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.173
No --

12:19.216 --> 12:21.175
You're very strong.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.394
Ohh.

12:23.438 --> 12:26.397
Uh, you know, you -- you --
you really don't have to --

12:26.441 --> 12:28.095
It's my daddy's
secret recipe.

12:28.138 --> 12:31.011
Cure everything
and anything.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.360
What's in it?

12:32.403 --> 12:34.536
What part of "secret"
don't you understand?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.235
Garth,
you're not a dentist.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.628
Oh, yes, I am.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.369
I, uh, was getting my degree
when the whole

12:41.412 --> 12:43.719
Hunter thing happened,
and I, you know...

12:43.763 --> 12:44.807
Killed the Tooth Fairy.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.809
She had it coming.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.029
Anyway,
after I left Hunting,

12:49.072 --> 12:50.726
I went back to school,
got my degree.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
Now I've got a good little
practice going.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.164
There.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.513
It's not like
all the wolves around here

12:55.557 --> 12:56.863
can go to a regular doc.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.430
Can't with all the cow hearts
we eat.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.651
Fang maintenance is a B.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.263
You've got to floss
all the time.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.091
Mm.

13:13.880 --> 13:17.231
Yeah, actually, it's --
it's not too, uh...

13:19.668 --> 13:21.017
Oh, God.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.150
I will tell you it's mostly
cayenne pepper.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.543
What?
Oh, God.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.594
Mommy,
the giant's crying.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.864
Garth: There.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.259
Ohh. Aah.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.093
Every-- Every--
Everything is burning.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.055
Open wide.
Mnh-mnh.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.404
Come on, buddy.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.059
Here comes the airplane.

14:03.103 --> 14:04.582
Mm.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.193
When was the last time
you saw a dentist?

14:06.236 --> 14:08.238
I 'unno.
Never.

14:16.594 --> 14:18.727
All right.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.120
I do see a few cavities.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.251
How many?

14:21.295 --> 14:22.905
17.
What?

14:22.949 --> 14:24.820
But don't you worry.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.866
'Cause I've got you.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.089
How do you think
I feel?

14:34.786 --> 14:36.658
Garth: Here we go.

14:36.701 --> 14:37.920
You're gonna be fine.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.053
-What is this?
-Dean...

14:40.096 --> 14:41.576
...I'm doing this for
your own good, buddy.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.794
Okay.

14:42.838 --> 14:45.493
Hey, I'm okay.

14:45.536 --> 14:48.409
Big Sam is o-okay.

14:51.629 --> 14:53.283
There you go.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.764
Let the gas do its thing.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.984
Deep breaths.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.292
Everything's fine.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.470
Yeah.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.124
There you go.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.942
You're all done.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.335
You did good.

17:12.379 --> 17:13.641
Mm.

17:18.820 --> 17:21.692
Kids are finally asleep.

17:21.736 --> 17:22.954
How are you feeling?

17:22.998 --> 17:25.087
Uh...

17:25.131 --> 17:26.480
Better, actually.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.351
I told you.Yeah.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.136
Hey.

17:30.179 --> 17:31.746
Where have you been?

17:31.789 --> 17:33.226
Gettung ma teef fixed.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.924
I had to numb him up.
He'll be fine in an hour.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.143
Mm.

17:37.186 --> 17:38.840
What?

17:38.883 --> 17:40.189
Okay.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.104
Seriously...

17:42.148 --> 17:44.106
what is going on here?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.368
What do you mean?

17:45.412 --> 17:46.587
I mean, apparently Dean's

17:46.630 --> 17:48.154
never been to
a dentist before,

17:48.197 --> 17:50.156
and suddenly he got
a mouthful of cavities,

17:50.199 --> 17:53.681
you're sick,
and your car is broken down.

17:53.724 --> 17:55.465
Who did you guys
piss off?

18:00.470 --> 18:01.863
God.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.562
I'm sorry. What?

18:07.434 --> 18:09.131
Yeah.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.481
God.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.832
TheGod
is trying to kill you?

18:14.876 --> 18:17.661
Well, uh, trying to
make us kill each other.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.881
Garth:
So, he's a writer,

18:19.924 --> 18:22.492
and you've basically been
the heroes of his story?

18:24.103 --> 18:26.105
I guess, yeah.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.845
Huh.

18:27.889 --> 18:29.325
Well,
what's that make me?

18:29.369 --> 18:31.849
A supporting character?
Special guest star?

18:31.893 --> 18:33.329
No, Garth,
it's not like that.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.331
Oh, no, no, no.
I want to be the guest star.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.811
Being the hero sucks.

18:36.854 --> 18:38.769
I mean, sure,
you'll probably win eventually,

18:38.813 --> 18:42.251
but until you do,
your life blows.

18:42.295 --> 18:44.384
Your parents get gunned down
in an alleyway.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.212
Your home planet
gets blown up.

18:46.255 --> 18:48.214
You, uh, interview
this good-looking rich guy,

18:48.257 --> 18:50.781
and it doesn't go well, so he
shows up at the hardware store

18:50.825 --> 18:54.350
where you work, and, man,
it starts to get, you know...

18:55.438 --> 18:58.224
It's from, uh --
We love "Fifty Shades."

18:58.267 --> 18:59.616
Yeah, we do.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.535
Who's the hero
in that?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.146
No, no, no.
The point is,

19:07.189 --> 19:09.496
the hero thing --
it's not fun.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.411
Well, I mean, there are some
good things about it.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.674
Like, uh, when was the last time
that Batman got a flat tire?

19:13.717 --> 19:16.024
Or Superman couldn't pay
his water bill?

19:16.067 --> 19:18.287
Or the power goes out
in the Red Room?

19:18.331 --> 19:19.941
Exactly.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.812
See, the hero never sweats
the small stuff.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.118
It slows down the story.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.729
So, then,
what happened?

19:25.773 --> 19:27.470
Chuck...downgraded us?

19:27.514 --> 19:28.906
Maybe, yeah.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.387
And now you're --Cursed.

19:31.431 --> 19:34.216
C-Cursed.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.391
Cursed.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.611
No -- normal.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.656
For the first time
in your lives,

19:39.700 --> 19:41.876
you're having normal-people
problems.

19:41.919 --> 19:44.792
You need to get
a colonoscopy, stat.

19:44.835 --> 19:46.359
What?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.579
So how do we fix this?

19:51.581 --> 19:53.844
I don't know.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.456
Brad: Bess?!

19:56.499 --> 19:57.935
Bess?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.120
Who're they?

20:09.164 --> 20:10.078
They're friends.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.427
Like Hunter friends?

20:11.471 --> 20:13.342
Brad, they're cool.

20:13.386 --> 20:14.822
Now tell us
what happened to you.

20:14.865 --> 20:16.302
Fell down the stairs.

20:16.345 --> 20:17.999
Sam: Brad, listen,

20:18.042 --> 20:19.566
we don't care
that you're a werewolf,

20:19.609 --> 20:21.872
but you got attacked by a
wraith, which is really weird.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.961
Now, we're just trying to
understand what happened.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.311
So help us.

20:25.354 --> 20:27.400
Please.

20:30.316 --> 20:31.621
Wow.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.144
I mean, wow.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.668
With the furrowed brow
and the puppy eyes --

20:34.711 --> 20:36.060
did you see that?

20:36.104 --> 20:37.714
That never actually works
for you, does it?

20:42.980 --> 20:44.286
Aah!

20:44.330 --> 20:45.853
Answer the question.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.463
Ow!

20:47.507 --> 20:49.900
Okay!

20:52.338 --> 20:55.036
It's -- It's a place...
monsters go.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.037
They fight for money.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.125
Money? Like, real money?

20:57.168 --> 20:59.040
Hey, I can talk.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.784
Good for you.
Yeah, real money.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.307
Okay?
They pay to watch it.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.048
They livestream it on
the Dark Web or whatever.

21:07.091 --> 21:08.528
Wait a second.
So -- So, you --

21:08.571 --> 21:10.007
Yeah, I needed the cash.

21:10.051 --> 21:11.835
Got three baby mamas --
I got bills.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.535
This place --
where is it?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.319
I know you don't want to tell
us, but --

21:17.363 --> 21:18.755
Belgrade, Minnesota.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.757
Old warehouse
off Peach Street.

21:20.801 --> 21:22.150
Well, that was easy.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.544
Yeah, well,
lot of fangs in there.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.589
You know,
I figure you two walk in,

21:26.633 --> 21:28.635
they're gonna rip you
to pieces.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.160
Ow!

21:32.203 --> 21:34.031
Really?!

21:38.819 --> 21:40.777
I don't think
you should go.

21:40.821 --> 21:43.476
Garth, we don't have a choice,
okay?

21:43.519 --> 21:44.694
That many freaks
in one place?

21:44.738 --> 21:45.869
You know they're dropping
bodies.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.218
Yeah, but the old
Sam and Dean,

21:47.262 --> 21:48.350
they could've handled this,
no problem.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.743
But you guys...

21:49.786 --> 21:51.048
Can't?

21:51.092 --> 21:52.876
Hey, look,
just because God

21:52.920 --> 21:54.748
yanked the magic horseshoe
out of our ass

21:54.791 --> 21:56.924
or whatever doesn't mean that
we're gonna give up.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.230
This is our job.
It's what we do.

21:59.274 --> 22:02.973
And, yeah, it might be a little
harder right now, but so what?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.888
Bring it.

22:04.932 --> 22:06.542
What he said.

22:06.586 --> 22:07.978
All right.
Then I'm coming, too.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.371
Oh, no, no, no.
No.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.460
Garth, come on.
You got a family, okay?

22:11.504 --> 22:13.462
You got a life.
If something went wrong --

22:13.506 --> 22:16.900
and, right now, with us,
everything's going wrong --

22:16.944 --> 22:19.381
we're not doing that to Bess,
to the kids.

22:23.211 --> 22:25.256
Okay, you're right.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.998
Well, at least let me get you
a new set of spark plugs.

22:28.042 --> 22:30.827
Yeah.

22:30.871 --> 22:32.438
Deal.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.945
Isolated, run-down -- yep,
that'll do Monster Bloodsport.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.904
This should be perfect.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.080
Oh, man.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.169
Bess makes the best
grilled cheese.

23:08.212 --> 23:10.693
Yeah, you ate like
seven of them.

23:10.737 --> 23:14.567
Well,
I'm a growing boy.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.046
Let's go.

23:16.090 --> 23:17.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.832
What?

23:18.875 --> 23:21.008
Dean...
Extra rounds, dead man's blood,

23:21.051 --> 23:22.749
first-aid kit,
emergency flares...

23:22.792 --> 23:24.011
Seriously?

23:24.054 --> 23:26.622
Dude,
if Garth was right,

23:26.666 --> 23:28.842
if we're really
normal now,

23:28.885 --> 23:31.279
we can't just
charge in there guns blazing.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.802
We need to be ready
for anything.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.589
Well, I guess we'd need
a grenade launcher.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.554
Hey, sweetheart.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.386
I don't think we've used that
.38 in about four years.

23:53.867 --> 23:56.043
Hyah!
Hyah!

24:08.011 --> 24:10.971
Welcome to Fight Club.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.499
I --

24:17.543 --> 24:20.676
You forget how to walk?

24:22.112 --> 24:24.288
Oh.
What was that?

24:26.552 --> 24:28.641
Not good, that's --

24:28.684 --> 24:30.077
You okay?

24:30.120 --> 24:33.210
Oh, God.

24:37.954 --> 24:39.303
I gotta go.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.914
Go?
I-I gotta go.

24:40.957 --> 24:43.351
What?Bathroom, bathroom,
bathroom.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.787
Dean?

24:44.831 --> 24:46.180
Dean?

24:57.757 --> 24:59.280
You know,
I think you might be

24:59.323 --> 25:00.890
lactose-intolerant now.

25:03.110 --> 25:06.200
I'm ok--

25:14.774 --> 25:16.427
Sam?

25:16.471 --> 25:19.779
Sammy?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.216
Oh, please,
just kill me now.

25:25.915 --> 25:28.527
Can do.

25:34.794 --> 25:36.622
Can't believe
they got the drop on me.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.449
I didn't even
hear them coming.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.756
Yeah, well, I got jumped while
I was in the crapper, okay?

25:40.800 --> 25:42.453
I win.

25:42.497 --> 25:45.195
"Normal"?
Sucks.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.118
Sam, Dean?

25:55.162 --> 25:56.163
Can I get you anything?

25:56.206 --> 25:58.208
Water?
Hot towel?

25:58.252 --> 25:59.427
Who are you?

25:59.470 --> 26:00.602
Cutty.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.908
This is my place.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.518
Oh, so all this
chain-link,

26:03.562 --> 26:05.607
razor wire, and rat crap is
yours, huh?

26:05.651 --> 26:06.913
Well, congrats.

26:06.956 --> 26:09.306
So, now you know me,
and I know you.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.091
We're like...friends.

26:11.134 --> 26:13.397
You keep all your friends
in a cage?

26:13.441 --> 26:15.008
Only the ones
I really like.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.576
All right. So, what're you?
A monster?

26:17.619 --> 26:19.665
I am. Shifter.

26:19.708 --> 26:22.450
Shifter?
So you chose that face?

26:22.493 --> 26:24.452
But I don't let my gifts
define me.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.889
See, more than anything,
I'm a sportsman.

26:26.933 --> 26:30.327
See, to me, man, monster,
they're at their best,

26:30.371 --> 26:32.895
their most pure,
in the heat of competition.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.288
Right.Yeah, sure,

26:34.331 --> 26:36.464
I could've killed you,
but no.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.074
I want to see your best.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.989
I want to see what the
Winchesters are capable of.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.731
Stripped down, closed in,
just you against the world.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.428
Or Maul here.

26:57.311 --> 26:59.661
"Maul"?
That -- Maul?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.315
Come on, man.
What's your real name, huh?

27:01.358 --> 27:03.360
Marvin? Marion?

27:03.404 --> 27:04.797
Murder.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.019
You want us to fight?

27:10.063 --> 27:11.630
Cutty: Obviously.

27:11.673 --> 27:12.718
Together, though.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.371
I don't want to break up
the team.

27:14.415 --> 27:15.677
You sure about that?

27:15.721 --> 27:17.374
'Cause if you know us,
you know the stories.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.072
See, me and my brother here,
we've taken down

27:19.115 --> 27:20.987
way bigger fellas than, uh,

27:21.030 --> 27:22.249
Meredith here.

27:23.554 --> 27:26.514
We've killed angels,
killed demons,

27:26.557 --> 27:28.821
Gods, and Alphas.

27:28.864 --> 27:31.475
So why don't you do yourself
a favor -- cut your losses,

27:31.519 --> 27:32.825
let us walk out
that door

27:32.868 --> 27:35.001
before we burn this craphole
to the ground.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.571
Yeah...no.

27:40.615 --> 27:42.312
Maul will show you
to your rooms.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.366
Announcer:
Tonight, two of Fight Night's

27:52.409 --> 27:55.456
biggest rivals will face off
in the ring again!

27:55.499 --> 27:59.155
Killer Wraith
versus Jamaica Djinn!

28:03.290 --> 28:07.163
Who will claim victory,
and who will suffer defeat?

28:07.207 --> 28:11.994
And then, in this ring,
the mighty Maul returns,

28:12.038 --> 28:17.217
and this time, he'll take on
the merciless Winchesters!

28:17.260 --> 28:20.437
Get ready for a...

28:20.481 --> 28:23.179
battle royale!

28:29.882 --> 28:31.797
All right, all right.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.234
Fighters to the ring.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.945
There's a lot of people --
lot of monsters -- out there.

28:49.989 --> 28:51.338
Dean: Awesome.

28:51.381 --> 28:52.992
Yeah, it's just how
I wanted to die --

28:53.035 --> 28:55.690
with a freakin' audience.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.387
Fight!

29:00.477 --> 29:01.522
What are you doing?

29:01.565 --> 29:03.829
Baby, come on, come on.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.656
Ha ha!

29:05.700 --> 29:09.356
I'm picking the lock.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.768
Hurry.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.900
Can't get it.
What?

29:31.944 --> 29:33.423
Ow!
Broke a nail.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.774
Here, let me do it.
Here, come on.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.786
We do this all the time.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.790
What the hell?

29:51.833 --> 29:53.313
Friggin' normal!

29:53.356 --> 29:55.750
That's what.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.317
Aw, come on!

29:57.360 --> 29:58.753
So could we ever actually
pick locks,

29:58.797 --> 30:00.276
or was it Chuck
this whole time?

30:00.320 --> 30:01.625
Well, dude,
if we can't do this,

30:01.669 --> 30:02.888
then how the hell
are we supposed to

30:02.931 --> 30:04.193
take care of
Supervamp out there?

30:04.237 --> 30:05.934
I don't think we can.

30:15.596 --> 30:18.425
No way.

30:18.468 --> 30:20.601
Wait. After everything,
there's no way that Chuck

30:20.644 --> 30:21.863
lets us die like this.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.083
Or he does, to --

30:24.126 --> 30:25.736
I don't know --
to teach us a lesson.

30:25.780 --> 30:28.522
Or maybe we just end up
paralyzed.

30:35.529 --> 30:39.620
No, we gotta win.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.535
We gotta win, man.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.711
That's not gonna be easy,
okay?

30:43.754 --> 30:45.582
But you and me?

30:45.626 --> 30:48.847
Not everything we did
was because of Chuck.

30:48.890 --> 30:50.805
It was us --

30:50.849 --> 30:53.895
the blood, the sweat,
the tears, man.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.462
That's us.

31:01.511 --> 31:05.385
We've been doing this
our whole lives.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.604
We're the best
in the world.

31:07.648 --> 31:09.955
So I say
we go out there.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.696
I say we go out there,
and we kick some ass.

31:24.099 --> 31:27.450
Announcer:
Your winner -- Djinn!

31:38.331 --> 31:43.162
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the main event!

31:43.205 --> 31:47.949
Your first fighter,
weighing in at 310 pounds,

31:47.993 --> 31:50.256
the mighty Maul!

32:13.670 --> 32:16.978
Announcer: And his opponent --
sorry, opponents --

32:17.022 --> 32:19.067
straight out of
Lawrence, Kansas.

32:19.111 --> 32:21.983
You know them,
you don't like them --

32:22.027 --> 32:24.551
the Winchesters!

32:31.862 --> 32:33.473
It's time.

32:33.516 --> 32:36.650
Oh, and, boys?
Shirts off.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.144
Damn it!

33:19.780 --> 33:21.651
I think a bug
went in my throat.

33:23.740 --> 33:25.133
Oh, freakin' normal.

33:25.177 --> 33:28.876
Announcer: Your winner -- Djinn!

33:28.919 --> 33:32.836

33:32.880 --> 33:34.229
It's time for...

33:34.273 --> 33:35.709
Garth?!

33:35.752 --> 33:37.058
Yo.

33:37.102 --> 33:38.886
What are you doing?I tried to call,

33:38.929 --> 33:40.279
and when you didn't pick up,
I figured you were super boned.

33:40.322 --> 33:41.758
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're super boned.

33:41.802 --> 33:44.848
Super boned! Come on.
Get us out of here.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.459
Hurry.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.641
You are so strong.

33:54.684 --> 33:56.338
Let's roll.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.862
So strong.

33:58.906 --> 34:00.560
It's time.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.475
Oh, and, boys?
Shirts off.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.784
Damn it!

34:07.828 --> 34:10.178
Come on! We gotta --
We gotta get somewhere!

34:10.222 --> 34:13.790
We gotta regroup!
We gotta come up with a plan!

34:17.229 --> 34:19.013
Garth? Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.537
We gotta get outta here before
the Monster Squad shows up!

34:21.581 --> 34:23.757
I've already got a plan.What?

34:23.800 --> 34:26.020
The Monster Squad
were the good guys.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.848
We're the Monster Squad.

34:46.171 --> 34:49.565
C-4 --
a Hunter's best friend.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.699
Cool, right?

34:52.742 --> 34:54.396
Thanks, Garth.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.355
All right.
Bring it in.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.878
Oh.
Well, still --

35:06.887 --> 35:08.149
No way.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.238
Go!
I've got this.

35:23.904 --> 35:26.167
Garth...

35:26.211 --> 35:27.690
Garth!

35:35.220 --> 35:36.830
Hey, did you believe
me when I said

35:36.873 --> 35:38.440
I thought we could win
this thing?

35:38.484 --> 35:40.355
Nope.Yeah, me neither.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.101
Bring it on, Madison!

35:49.886 --> 35:52.280
Hyah!

35:52.324 --> 35:54.152
Ohh!

36:05.075 --> 36:06.729
Unh!

36:06.773 --> 36:07.948
Hyah!

36:13.780 --> 36:15.390
Ooh.

36:25.879 --> 36:27.402
This was fun.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.845
Fun.

36:35.889 --> 36:38.587
Huh?

36:38.631 --> 36:41.460
Unh!

36:57.258 --> 36:58.868
He got Garth'd.

36:58.912 --> 37:02.437
Aha-ha!

37:02.481 --> 37:04.831
It's weird.
It, like, hurts in my stomach.

37:04.874 --> 37:06.485
It's not even --
It's, like, up here.

37:06.528 --> 37:07.834
It's, like,
where my ribs are.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.836
I don't know why.

37:09.879 --> 37:12.099
Has my voice gone higher?

37:22.283 --> 37:24.372
This Cass keeps
looking at me weird.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.375
So kind of like
the real Cass.

37:27.419 --> 37:28.898
I packed you
some of those

37:28.942 --> 37:30.987
grilled-cheese sandwiches
you love.

37:31.031 --> 37:32.250
Oh.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.947
Oh, thanks.

37:40.519 --> 37:42.129
Uh, you know what?

37:42.172 --> 37:43.565
I think this guy's got a little
something for you.

37:43.609 --> 37:45.393
Oh.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.700
Yeah.
We better go.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.616
Oh. Okay.

37:50.659 --> 37:51.660
Bye.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.314
I'll walk you out.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.968
Okay.
Bye, guys.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.449
Bye.
Bye.

38:07.807 --> 38:11.332
Hey, listen, Garth, I just want
to say, what -- what you did --

38:11.376 --> 38:13.203
Ah. It was nothing.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.118
Nothing?
You saved us

38:15.162 --> 38:16.598
and blew up
a bunch of monsters.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.860
That's not nothing.
That's --

38:17.904 --> 38:19.688
That's being a hero.

38:23.126 --> 38:26.129
I guess I learned
from the best.

38:26.173 --> 38:29.045
You guys,
you gonna be okay?

38:29.089 --> 38:30.525
What?
Because we're normal?

38:30.569 --> 38:33.311
That, and because
the Almighty's after you.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.707
Right, yeah.
Um, I, uh...

38:38.751 --> 38:41.014
We don't know.

38:41.057 --> 38:43.843
Listen, I wasn't gonna
say this earlier, but...

38:43.886 --> 38:45.671
there might be something
that could help.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.107
What kind of something?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.804
I heard this story once
about this place

38:48.848 --> 38:51.981
you can go
if your luck's gone bad.

38:52.025 --> 38:53.374
What kind of place?

38:53.418 --> 38:54.810
Not sure.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.595
The guy who told me
said it was in Alaska,

38:56.638 --> 38:58.814
on the road between
Barrow and Kotzebue.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.079
He said, "You'll know it
when you see it,"

39:03.123 --> 39:04.994
whatever that means.

39:05.038 --> 39:08.389
Look, it might not even be real,
and you know this stuff works.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.130
There's always a catch.

39:10.173 --> 39:14.047
And being normal -- I mean,
maybe you'll get used to it.

39:14.090 --> 39:16.005
Yeah. Maybe.

39:16.049 --> 39:19.357
Anyway,
if you ever need anything...

39:19.400 --> 39:20.967
We know.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.185
Good.

39:22.229 --> 39:25.014
Thanks for everything.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.281
All right, Garth.

39:33.458 --> 39:34.763
Hey, you know what?

39:34.807 --> 39:36.417
You don't smell too bad
yourself.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.288
Thanks.
It's Hai Karate.

39:40.203 --> 39:42.815
Okay.

39:46.384 --> 39:49.430
