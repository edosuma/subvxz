Yum, Kimmy Gibbler. You look good
when you're not dressed like yourself.

01:09.630 --> 01:12.048
I gotta work it for girls' night out.

01:12.132 --> 01:14.092
And you are on fleek.

01:16.386 --> 01:18.555
I hope it's still fleek to say "fleek."

01:20.348 --> 01:23.727
When have we looked this hot
and gotten along this great?

01:23.811 --> 01:24.853
Never.

01:26.271 --> 01:28.106
- We better get proof. Selfie.
- Yes.

01:28.315 --> 01:29.691
Okay. Ready?

01:29.900 --> 01:31.485
No, tilt 'til we're skinny.

01:32.068 --> 01:33.194
[camera clicking]

01:34.696 --> 01:38.993
Great. I'll tag you on Instagram,
but first I have to unblock you.

01:39.952 --> 01:41.077
You blocked me?

01:42.162 --> 01:43.872
Let's not fight, okay?

01:43.956 --> 01:46.000
Remember the good times.

01:46.834 --> 01:49.085
Well... good time.

01:50.754 --> 01:51.839
Whoa!

01:51.922 --> 01:54.382
You guys look fleek!

01:56.301 --> 01:58.386
And that's the death of "fleek."

01:59.721 --> 02:01.890
D.J., it's girls' night out.

02:02.516 --> 02:07.062
Oh, I know, I'm sorry.
I have laundry to do. Party on without me.

02:07.270 --> 02:09.523
Deej, we planned this whole night for you.

02:09.606 --> 02:11.066
You have to go out and have fun.

02:11.274 --> 02:13.610
I have fun.

02:13.819 --> 02:16.738
Just last night
I stuck my tongue out at Tommy,

02:16.947 --> 02:19.783
and he stuck his tongue out at me,
it was hilarious!

02:20.951 --> 02:23.662
Come on, Deej.
Let yourself have some adult fun.

02:23.871 --> 02:27.457
I'm officially naming the three of us...
the She-Wolf Pack!

02:27.541 --> 02:29.501
[howls like a wolf]

02:30.836 --> 02:33.254
Don't ever do that in public.

02:34.381 --> 02:37.801
Look, I can't go out tonight.
I don't have anything to wear.

02:38.010 --> 02:39.678
We knew you'd say that.

02:39.887 --> 02:42.097
Which is why we bought you this.

02:44.599 --> 02:45.433
Whoa.

02:45.893 --> 02:48.436
Is this for me or Malibu Barbie?

02:49.688 --> 02:53.817
Look, I really appreciate all of this,
but I don't have a babysitter.

02:54.359 --> 02:56.486
Oh. We got you a babysitter.

02:58.780 --> 03:01.742
Oh! We got you a babysitter!

03:02.784 --> 03:04.786
[imitates a fanfare]

03:10.918 --> 03:13.087
- Joey!
- Hi, Deej.

03:14.254 --> 03:17.674
I can't believe you would
fly in from Vegas just to babysit.

03:17.883 --> 03:20.552
[adopts silly voice]
Of course we... would.

03:22.137 --> 03:24.056
Looks like you covered everything.

03:24.264 --> 03:26.141
- Yep.
- I'll go upstairs and change.

03:26.224 --> 03:27.684
Ah. No, no, no, no.

03:27.893 --> 03:30.687
If you go upstairs,
you're gonna start doing mom stuff.

03:30.771 --> 03:32.439
You can change in the Uber.

03:34.942 --> 03:37.235
I'm not changing in a car.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.738
What if Uber sees my boobers?

03:41.907 --> 03:44.034
Well, then you won't have to tip.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.288
Deej, changing in a car is no big deal.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.999
Once, I stumbled out of a party,
hopped into a cab,

03:51.083 --> 03:53.710
changed into
a hideous fuchsia bridesmaid's dress

03:53.794 --> 03:56.671
and walked down the aisle
looking better than the bride.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.175
That was my wedding.

04:03.261 --> 04:06.932
[Steph] Jackson, Max, Ramona,
come say goodbye! Joey's here.

04:07.141 --> 04:09.559
- Hi, kids!
- Whatever.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.773
Oh, I am feeling the love.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.233
[D.J.] Okay, remember, you need to...

04:17.317 --> 04:21.654
Brush your teeth, do your homework,
don't play with matches, blah-blah-blah.

04:21.738 --> 04:23.031
Come on. Let's go.

04:23.949 --> 04:26.618
- Have fun. Bye, girls. Love you.
- Bye. Love you, too.

04:28.078 --> 04:30.497
Alright. Hey, guys...

04:30.705 --> 04:34.209
And I am talking to absolutely no one.

04:35.752 --> 04:38.672
Hey, Tommy, how about these kids today

04:38.755 --> 04:42.176
with the video games
and the electronic devices?

04:42.383 --> 04:47.305
How about you and I have a real,
meaningful conversation?

04:47.388 --> 04:48.348
[phone beeping]

04:48.431 --> 04:50.142
Whoops! I got a text, buddy. Sorry.

04:53.145 --> 04:56.023
[dance music playing]

05:00.110 --> 05:01.653
[giggling]

05:04.823 --> 05:06.200
Will you come on?

05:07.492 --> 05:08.827
Come on.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.959
I don't know if I should be tugging
this thing down or pulling it up.

05:17.252 --> 05:19.546
Looking fierce, She-Wolf Pack!

05:19.754 --> 05:21.464
[howls]

05:23.050 --> 05:26.261
What did we talk about?
We only howl in private.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.139
Do you have reservations?

05:29.347 --> 05:32.184
Yes, I feel like
I should be at home with my kids.

05:36.604 --> 05:37.772
They're with me.

05:37.981 --> 05:40.608
Kimmy Gibbler in the club! Right this way!

05:44.529 --> 05:48.283
Wow!
They really treat you like royalty here.

05:48.366 --> 05:52.871
Velvet rope, glitter pillows.
Our own couch.

05:53.080 --> 05:56.583
Back when Fernando and I were together,
we practically lived here.

05:56.666 --> 06:00.754
I even kept a toothbrush and a clean bra
behind the cash register.

06:00.962 --> 06:02.923
I'm gonna get us some tequila shots.

06:03.131 --> 06:05.259
Make sure mine has extra ice.

06:05.341 --> 06:07.719
And a little umbrella with a cherry in it.

06:08.678 --> 06:10.305
Thank you!

06:13.349 --> 06:15.852
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me, gentlemen.

06:16.937 --> 06:20.690
Excuse me. Can I get three tequila shots
for me and my girls?

06:23.610 --> 06:26.029
That gaggle of lovely ladies?

06:26.238 --> 06:29.991
My brother and I would love
to give you the gift of alcohol.

06:30.075 --> 06:34.079
But allow us a moment to figure out
which one of us is paying.

06:35.747 --> 06:36.915
Tie.

06:37.373 --> 06:39.960
- Tie.
- Come on, dude.

06:40.168 --> 06:44.172
It's 9:30 on a Friday night
and D.J.'s not in her PJs.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.675
Look at me! I'm rapping!

06:49.010 --> 06:52.597
Hey. Look what I found.
Two studs plus ten shots.

06:54.141 --> 06:55.976
I call dibs on the little one.

06:57.144 --> 07:00.063
- Thanks for the drinks.
- You're quite welcome.

07:01.564 --> 07:03.358
Have a good evening.

07:03.566 --> 07:05.277
And they're sitting.

07:06.236 --> 07:07.904
I'm Maks. This is my brother Val.

07:08.113 --> 07:10.240
I'm Stephanie. This is my sister, D.J.

07:10.448 --> 07:13.701
Sisters with brothers! That's kinky-hot.

07:14.702 --> 07:17.372
To sisters and brothers.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.249
And whoever you are.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.378
[all] To sisters and brothers
and whoever she is.

07:28.091 --> 07:29.301
[exclaims]

07:29.384 --> 07:30.969
That's not SunnyD.

07:34.306 --> 07:36.266
Hey. What's up, guys?

07:36.474 --> 07:39.602
I'm watching a live satellite feed
from Pluto.

07:39.686 --> 07:41.646
Not much going on.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.982
You like science?

07:44.191 --> 07:48.736
Alright, here's an impression
of astrophysicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson,

07:48.820 --> 07:51.990
early morning, after breakfast,
cutting the cheese.

07:52.866 --> 07:55.618
[imitating farting noise]

08:03.418 --> 08:04.878
Really? Nothing?

08:04.961 --> 08:10.591
Joey, everybody knows that the great
Neil deGrasse Tyson does not fart.

08:11.718 --> 08:14.346
Come on!
I'm here to have fun with you kids.

08:14.429 --> 08:16.264
Ramona, get in here.

08:16.472 --> 08:18.016
That's a bad idea.

08:18.766 --> 08:22.145
What is it?
I'm binge-watching the <i>Sharknado</i> trilogy.

08:22.729 --> 08:25.565
- Come in.
- I'm banned from this room.

08:26.358 --> 08:28.609
Jackson, that is not very nice.

08:28.818 --> 08:31.279
It's okay. I banned myself.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.743
Well, tonight we are going
to have some fun together.

08:36.826 --> 08:41.373
Our first game is called
try and get your devices back.

08:43.082 --> 08:44.959
[Ramona] Joey, get back here!

08:47.087 --> 08:49.005
Joey, get back here!

08:49.089 --> 08:51.258
[all three kids yelling]

08:53.927 --> 08:56.721
And the winner of our first game is me

08:56.930 --> 09:00.392
because tonight we are going device-free.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.187
How are we to have any fun
without our stuff?

09:04.396 --> 09:06.106
Ladies and gentlemen,

09:06.189 --> 09:11.736
I give to you the Gladstone Gallery
of wacky weapons!

09:14.281 --> 09:16.908
- Holy chalupas!
- [Joey] Mm-hmm.

09:18.201 --> 09:19.577
These are your classics.

09:19.660 --> 09:23.790
You got your super soakers,
your silly string, your slime rifles

09:23.998 --> 09:26.376
and the granddaddy of 'em all,

09:26.460 --> 09:30.213
a Joey Gladstone-designed
toilet-paper leaf-blower gun.

09:31.839 --> 09:34.592
Could have used this baby
last night at Arby's.

09:36.177 --> 09:39.055
These are for little kids,
so, you little kids, have fun.

09:39.264 --> 09:42.642
[gasps] She just called you a little kid.
Are you gonna take that?

09:42.725 --> 09:44.436
No, I'm not.

09:47.522 --> 09:49.023
You think that's funny?

09:49.232 --> 09:50.775
[groans]

09:52.568 --> 09:54.654
Don't I get any silly string?

09:57.115 --> 09:59.200
Not what I meant.

10:03.204 --> 10:04.247
[Max laughs]

10:04.872 --> 10:06.500
[Jackson] You ain't getting away!

10:06.707 --> 10:09.002
D.J. and I were fighting
over the closet pole.

10:09.210 --> 10:12.422
I let go and she rams it
right through our dad's bedroom wall.

10:12.506 --> 10:13.965
[all laugh]

10:14.048 --> 10:17.260
And then we sing this stupid song to Dad
about how much we love him

10:17.344 --> 10:19.513
and he doesn't even notice the hole.

10:21.097 --> 10:24.725
And then of course Michelle walked in
and said, "You got it, dude."

10:26.227 --> 10:28.396
But you weren't even there.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.607
I know, but I'm pretty sure
she walked in and said that.

10:35.028 --> 10:36.446
[Steph] Oh... It's Macy Gray.

10:36.654 --> 10:39.491
She's my girl.
She is gonna freak when she sees me.

10:39.699 --> 10:42.035
Oh. Like you know Macy Gray!

10:42.243 --> 10:45.872
It so happens that she was singing
at a party I was spinning at in Bangkok.

10:45.955 --> 10:48.708
We got raided by the police,
had to escape on an elephant.

10:48.791 --> 10:52.003
It took a wrong turn and three days later
we woke up in Cambodia.

10:53.380 --> 10:55.089
You just made that up.

10:56.299 --> 10:58.218
Hey, DJ Tanner!

11:02.930 --> 11:06.226
I haven't seen you
since that elephant ride in Cambodia.

11:07.602 --> 11:10.271
- Great to see you.
- Hi.

11:10.355 --> 11:12.232
- Hi, Miss Gray.
- Hello.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.568
- I'm the real D.J. Tanner.
- Oh. Hey.

11:14.775 --> 11:15.902
You spin?

11:16.110 --> 11:19.906
Oh. Well, I used to,
but now I'm more into Pilates.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.659
- Hi, Macy. I'm Kimmy.
- Hi.

11:23.743 --> 11:26.496
- I just have to say, I love your music.
- Thanks!

11:26.704 --> 11:28.706
And your Thanksgiving Day parade.

11:33.711 --> 11:37.340
You know, it takes me all night
to blow up that Kermit balloon.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.056
So, would the sisters
like to dance with the brothers?

11:48.435 --> 11:51.771
Well, we would,
but that would leave Kimmy all alone.

11:53.106 --> 11:55.066
We can find somebody for Kimmy.

11:56.401 --> 11:58.361
The club's full of eye candy.

11:59.487 --> 12:02.073
And butt candy! Yum!

12:04.200 --> 12:06.327
Eww! It's Fernando.

12:08.246 --> 12:10.331
Eww! Fernando.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.333
Who's Fernando?

12:13.293 --> 12:16.754
It's Kimmy's soon-to-be ex-husband.
We don't like him.

12:16.963 --> 12:19.132
<i>Hola</i>, Kimberlina.

12:20.883 --> 12:23.177
[both] Eww! Fernando!

12:24.471 --> 12:29.309
I had a dream that we were here
together again at Euphoria.

12:30.685 --> 12:33.771
But I never dreamed
that my dream would come true.

12:35.064 --> 12:36.983
It's like a dream come true!

12:38.568 --> 12:43.490
Everybody, give it up
for our special surprise guest, Macy Gray!

12:47.952 --> 12:52.666
Thank you. I wanna see all you sexy people
out on the dance floor.

12:52.748 --> 12:54.750
This is from my new album called <i>The Way.</i>

12:54.834 --> 12:58.672
You can buy it online
or out of the trunk of my car.

[band playing "Hands" by Macy Gray]

13:00.674 --> 13:03.092
Kimberlina, may I have this dance?

13:07.054 --> 13:09.349
Look what you have done to my hips.

13:12.018 --> 13:14.437
Now look what you've done to my shoulders.

13:15.313 --> 13:17.565
Everything is wiggling.

- Ignore him.

14:21.755 --> 14:25.759
That's impossible. It's seasonal
and rotates with <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

14:27.218 --> 14:31.389
Remember how we always won
Euphoria's Legendary Nightly Dance-Off?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.974
22 weeks in a row.

14:34.183 --> 14:38.854

The ladies' room was not as crowded
as I hoped.

15:09.427 --> 15:10.637
This is Kimberlina.

15:10.845 --> 15:13.765
Oh! The almost ex-wife.

15:13.848 --> 15:18.853
The way Fernando talks about you, I was
expecting something much more... more.

15:20.313 --> 15:22.482
Another Fernando girlfriend.

15:22.565 --> 15:25.109
I'd ask you your name,
but what's the point?

15:27.987 --> 15:30.239
And I was worried this would be awkward.

15:31.991 --> 15:34.661
I'll see you at the table, <i>papacito.</i>

15:35.620 --> 15:38.873
You dog! You're here with another woman
and you're hitting on me?

15:39.081 --> 15:41.835
No matter who I'm with,
I'm always with you.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.170
I can't believe I let you dip me!

15:50.259 --> 15:52.512
I'm sorry,
but I have to go check on my friend.

15:54.930 --> 15:56.641
Oh, I... There's a...

15:57.975 --> 16:01.937
This... this She-Wolf Pack thing,
I have to go pretend to care.

16:02.021 --> 16:05.399
Just... you keep that motor running, baby.
I will be back.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.987
[inaudible]

16:18.078 --> 16:21.081
That's for eating all the raisins
out of the Raisin Bran!

16:21.875 --> 16:24.335
That's for having terrible aim
in the bathroom!

16:26.045 --> 16:27.588
That might have been me.

16:29.716 --> 16:32.218
You try to pee on your tippy-toes.

16:34.637 --> 16:37.348
- Who's there?
- [man] Pizza delivery, dude.

16:37.557 --> 16:40.059
Pizza? Awesome!

16:40.267 --> 16:41.769
I call pizza truce.

16:47.149 --> 16:48.317
Joey!

16:48.526 --> 16:50.319
[shouting]

17:03.332 --> 17:06.042
The old fake pizza delivery trick.

17:08.087 --> 17:10.381
Wait. There's no pizza?

17:11.382 --> 17:12.842
Let me help you with that mess.

17:25.563 --> 17:28.398
[impersonates the Terminator]
Consider yourself wiped.

17:30.818 --> 17:34.739
You guys are pathetic. You couldn't
beat me if it was three on one.

17:34.822 --> 17:36.657
[laughs]

17:36.866 --> 17:40.411
This is not right.
We're a mess and Joey's spotless.

17:40.494 --> 17:44.081
Let's stop sliming each other
and start sliming Joey.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.042
- Yeah.
- So let me get this straight!

17:48.753 --> 17:51.171
There was never any pizza?

17:53.507 --> 17:59.305
Alright, sexy people, it's time now for
Euphoria's Legendary Nightly Dance-Off!

18:01.515 --> 18:02.809
Let's go.

18:02.892 --> 18:04.894
I don't wanna see Fernando's smug face

18:04.978 --> 18:07.855
when he wins
Euphoria's Legendary Nightly Dance-Off.

18:07.939 --> 18:08.982
Kimmy, wait.

18:10.232 --> 18:15.321
Fernando's not winning Euphoria's
whatever, whatever dance thing. You are!

18:16.280 --> 18:18.032
- Dancing with who?
- With me!

18:19.951 --> 18:23.621
We'll do our <i>Dirty Dancing</i> routine
from the fourth-grade talent show!

18:24.998 --> 18:26.040
But we lost.

18:26.248 --> 18:29.335
Well, that's only because I dropped you
and you broke your arm.

18:30.586 --> 18:33.255
You guys,
I'll get Macy to sing "Time Of My Life"

18:33.339 --> 18:35.132
and you two dance like it's 1987.

18:39.303 --> 18:40.888
Aw... [groans softly]

18:41.096 --> 18:43.516
I'm sorry.
It's still She-Wolf drama stuff.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.643
Come on. Ladies, let's go.

18:51.106 --> 18:53.275
Once again, we have no women.

18:54.318 --> 18:56.988
So what? Let's win this thing ourselves.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.241
Prepare to dance.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.165
Macy, I need a big favor.

19:08.374 --> 19:11.168
My sister's best friend needs
to get back at her two-timing ex.

19:11.377 --> 19:16.298
Well, you bring that low-life cheater to
the alley. I'll give him heaven and hell.

19:17.884 --> 19:22.013
I just need you to sing "Time Of My Life"
from <i>Dirty Dancing</i>. Do you know it?

19:22.221 --> 19:24.223
Know it? I'm crazy for Swayze!

19:26.433 --> 19:31.772
- But it's a duet. You gotta help me out.
- I couldn't sing with a star like you.

Okay, it's time now
for the last two couples to battle it out.

20:55.773 --> 21:00.820
There's also a '78 Cadillac Seville

21:00.903 --> 21:03.156
with its lights on in the parking lot.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.076
Is it pink?

21:08.077 --> 21:09.870
Oh, damn, that's mine.

21:13.833 --> 21:15.375
We don't have a chance.

21:15.584 --> 21:17.753
We can win this.

21:17.837 --> 21:20.923
But we're gonna have
to bust out our big <i>Dirty Dancing</i> lift.

21:21.966 --> 21:23.884
The one that broke my arm?

21:25.178 --> 21:28.263
- We can do this.
- Sure that's not the tequila talking?

21:28.472 --> 21:29.849
Well, yeah, it totally is.

21:34.103 --> 21:37.690
You're way out of your league... D.J.

21:40.109 --> 21:43.278
For your information, I'm in a league.

21:45.656 --> 21:47.491
A bowling league.

21:49.202 --> 21:50.911
There's no way you can beat me.

21:52.705 --> 21:55.208
You're not just beating me,
you're beating Kimmy.

21:57.877 --> 22:00.087
And you will break her heart again.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.801
Let me show you how it's done, Grandma.

22:07.887 --> 22:10.973
[gasps] Toe cramp. Toe cramp.

22:11.182 --> 22:12.349
Ow!

22:14.227 --> 22:17.604
Come on, Kimmy. I got you. I got you.

22:18.397 --> 22:19.857
Help me! Help!

22:23.652 --> 22:26.239
[crowd cheering]

22:33.829 --> 22:37.041
And the winners
are these two luscious lesbians!

22:40.711 --> 22:42.880
Get up here, you sexy people.

22:43.089 --> 22:44.464
We're the sexy people!

22:48.802 --> 22:52.681
And give it up for Macy,
my sister Stephanie and partner Kimmy!

22:52.890 --> 22:55.184
[crowd cheering]

22:56.977 --> 22:59.021
Nobody puts Gibbler in a corner.

23:00.231 --> 23:02.191
Good one, Kimmy.

23:02.275 --> 23:06.237
Oh... I was just gonna stay in tonight,

23:06.445 --> 23:10.532
but my friends insisted
that I go out and have some adult fun.

23:10.616 --> 23:13.577
They knew I needed to take care of me.

23:13.660 --> 23:17.039
Oh, I love you guys so darn much!

23:20.251 --> 23:25.214
Thank you, Euphoria!
And the wait staff and the bartenders.

23:25.422 --> 23:28.508
I wanna thank my fourth-grade
dance teacher, Miss Murray,

23:28.717 --> 23:32.096
who had no faith in me,
but that only made me work harder.

23:33.139 --> 23:34.807
Macy, I'm not finished yet.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.142
Yes, you are.

23:37.935 --> 23:41.188
Shots for everybody!
She-Wolf Pack is buying!

23:41.272 --> 23:42.356
[howling]

23:42.564 --> 23:44.275
[crowd whooping]

23:45.901 --> 23:48.362
What am I doing here? I won a Grammy.

23:51.865 --> 23:55.535
Joey's sneaking around the house.
He's heading towards the front door.

23:55.744 --> 23:58.122
Okay, everybody, in our positions.

23:58.331 --> 24:00.540
Okay, I hear footsteps.

24:30.904 --> 24:34.449
Beautiful plan gone horribly wrong.

24:39.246 --> 24:41.081
How rude!

24:44.293 --> 24:47.546
In our defense,
we never thought it'd work this well.

24:49.756 --> 24:53.052
But enough about us, how was your night?

24:55.429 --> 24:59.016
I had so much fun making a mess.
I think I have a dark side.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.519
What's happening, Joey?

25:02.728 --> 25:04.021
Please.

25:04.104 --> 25:08.567
Keep in mind, when I got here
I found some kids who didn't get along

25:08.650 --> 25:11.737
and were obsessed
with their electronic devices.

25:11.820 --> 25:17.617
Now I'm leaving you with some pals
who had some great fun together,

25:17.701 --> 25:21.747
the good old-fashioned way,
with family-friendly violence.

25:24.917 --> 25:27.420
Okay, you're welcome. So long, everybody.

25:29.755 --> 25:32.966
[all shouting over each other]

25:33.175 --> 25:35.052
Joey, wait! You forgot my hug!

25:35.261 --> 25:36.970
Oh! Sorry, little Max.

25:37.179 --> 25:38.347
I'm sorry.

25:38.431 --> 25:40.266
[shrieking]

25:47.981 --> 25:49.775
Told you I had a dark side!
