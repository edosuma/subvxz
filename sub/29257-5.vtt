WEBVTT

00:26.192 --> 00:27.902
Wha-- what's going on?

00:40.415 --> 00:42.042
Huh... huh...

00:44.085 --> 00:45.378
Wha... huh...

00:45.587 --> 00:47.088
-No, no, no.

00:47.714 --> 00:51.259
At last, you are awake. We can begin.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.220
What are you gonna do?

00:55.346 --> 00:57.182
Claim my trophy.

00:57.974 --> 01:01.061
All the hunters, warriors,

01:01.186 --> 01:03.521
now their strength is my own,

01:03.772 --> 01:05.774
just as yours soon will be.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.819
No! I need Gelfling alive.

01:10.820 --> 01:12.697
Must bring before Emperor.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.241
I will have my trophy.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.703
-I will have this Gelfling’s tongue!

01:18.787 --> 01:19.662
No!

01:20.455 --> 01:21.623
No!

01:22.957 --> 01:26.669
-After I drag him back to castle, yes?

01:26.836 --> 01:29.339
After Emperor sees my triumph.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.509
-After General is humiliated.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.887
After I have my seat back.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.472
My trophy.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.309
Pathetic! You hunt a chair!

01:41.392 --> 01:45.230
No. I hunt power.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.902
You have your trophy, I have mine. Hm?

01:50.985 --> 01:52.779
I will honor your hunt.

01:53.863 --> 01:55.615
-Take your trophy...
-Mmm...

01:55.698 --> 01:57.325
...and I will take mine.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.452
But if you deny me...

01:59.994 --> 02:01.496
Yes! Yes!

02:01.579 --> 02:04.916
Hunter will never stop
until hunt is finished.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.338
Mmm...

02:11.714 --> 02:13.633
Where is it?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.844
-Here?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.513
Or here?

02:18.847 --> 02:20.974
Get away from me! Leave me alone!

02:23.601 --> 02:26.312
-Mira! No!
- Here it is!

02:26.437 --> 02:28.898
-No! No!

02:29.607 --> 02:30.775
Yes.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.318
-Good.
-No!

02:33.570 --> 02:36.197
Give it back! Give it back!

02:36.656 --> 02:38.116
Ah!

02:42.495 --> 02:44.622
-Give it back!

02:45.456 --> 02:47.041
No! Mira!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.209
No!

02:49.043 --> 02:53.131
-No!
- Ha!

02:53.214 --> 02:55.842
-No! No!

02:55.925 --> 02:58.052
Tasty.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.221
-Tasty!
-No! No!

03:00.972 --> 03:02.098
And now...

03:03.016 --> 03:05.602
we send her back to Thra.

03:08.938 --> 03:11.441
Mira!

03:24.829 --> 03:28.374
Be careful, All-Maudra.
There's Landstrider dung everywhere.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.460
Ugh.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.337
-Thank you, Paladin.
-Mm.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.424
The entire Landstrider herd
went missing last night.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.801
At first, we assumed some foolish Gelfling
had left the pen open.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.473
But then we discovered the fences
had been broken from the inside.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.812
The Landstriders went mad?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.856
I’ve never seen such a thing.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.859
-How many in the herd?
-Almost 80.

03:54.943 --> 03:57.570
This is the only one we found.
The rest ran off.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.535
That's what I thought,

04:05.370 --> 04:06.746
until I saw her eyes.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.837
Easy. Easy.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.259
Easy.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.472
The farmers tell stories
of a strange blight

04:24.555 --> 04:28.226
marked by purple veins in the ground.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.521
I’d assumed they were making excuses

04:31.604 --> 04:33.648
to justify their lack of tithes.

04:34.065 --> 04:36.985
But only a fool does not believe
their own eyes.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.279
Easy. Shh...

04:39.362 --> 04:42.365
-Best we return the beast to Thra.
-Stop! Hand me your blade.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.701
-But--
-It's not a request, Paladin.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.077
As you command.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.215
Watch out!

05:03.052 --> 05:05.471
Thra will decide the beast's fate...

05:06.681 --> 05:09.142
as it decides all our fates.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.685
Of course, All-Maudra.

05:11.185 --> 05:15.231
I'll send Seladon to inspect
the rest of our Landstrider herds.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.607
- All-Maudra!
-Huh?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.943
All-Maudra!

05:19.068 --> 05:21.446
-The Skeksis lords!
-What about them?

05:22.447 --> 05:25.283
They're in Ha'rar.
They're waiting for you in your chambers.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.118
Hm...

05:36.461 --> 05:37.337
Get back.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.594
Meh!

05:50.850 --> 05:53.811
You and Kylan find Gurjin
and make for Ha'rar.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.563
My mother will grant you safe harbor.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.940
What about you?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.151
I want to know what the Skeksis are up to.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.945
Try not to get yourself killed, Vapran.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.740
Until our paths meet again, Drenchen.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.783
Hm.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.707
Yes.

06:23.591 --> 06:24.717
Come.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.720
Come.

06:30.431 --> 06:31.933
Yes.

06:32.308 --> 06:35.103
Now we shall see.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.562
Give me all.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.864
Good!

06:48.491 --> 06:49.700
Yes.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.829
Yes!

06:53.079 --> 06:54.789
As I’d hoped.

06:58.709 --> 06:59.669
Huh?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.048
Spying eyes.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.474
<i>♪...crawlies creep ♪</i>

07:13.641 --> 07:19.021
<i>♪ So lay down, my childling, and sleep ♪</i>

07:19.105 --> 07:25.027
<i>♪ No need to fear</i>
<i>And no need to weep ♪</i>

07:30.533 --> 07:31.409
Hup?

07:34.245 --> 07:35.830
Am I going the wrong way again?

07:36.706 --> 07:38.499
Deet...

07:38.583 --> 07:39.500
What?

07:40.710 --> 07:42.336
No go Ha'rar.

07:43.588 --> 07:44.755
But I have to go.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.467
The All-Maudra
has to know about the Darkening

07:47.550 --> 07:49.260
and what happened to Rian.

07:52.430 --> 07:53.848
What's wrong, Hup?

07:54.640 --> 07:56.809
Hup scared.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.023
I understand.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.066
I was scared, too.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.277
Hup <i>ne </i>scared.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.654
Hup... Hup scared Deet.

08:09.405 --> 08:11.908
You're... scared for me?

08:14.035 --> 08:16.120
Hup want to protect Deet.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.832
<i>Otsa ne </i>sword?

08:20.917 --> 08:24.670
<i>-Otsa </i>spoon! Silly spoon!

08:25.588 --> 08:27.965
Hup <i>ne </i>Paladin.

08:29.383 --> 08:31.886
Hup nobody.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.307
Did nobody rescue me from the Spitter?

08:37.642 --> 08:40.561
Did nobody stand up for me
at Stone-in-the-Wood?

08:41.562 --> 08:44.315
Did nobody protect me from the gobbles?

08:45.149 --> 08:46.984
<i>Ne.</i>

08:48.027 --> 08:48.903
Hup did.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.030
That's right.

08:52.657 --> 08:55.243
You're on your way to Ha'rar
to become a Paladin.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.037
But if you ask me...

09:03.417 --> 09:04.794
you already are.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.725
To Ha'rar! Hup!

09:39.036 --> 09:41.622
Curse these low Gelfling ceilings.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.459
My lords...

09:46.669 --> 09:49.171
this is an unexpected pleasure.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.676
-Hm...

09:54.885 --> 09:59.390
-What is this?
-That is a unamoth chrysalis, General.

10:00.057 --> 10:02.685
The sigil of the Vapra clan.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.980
-No!

10:09.025 --> 10:11.277
Blech!

10:11.944 --> 10:14.780
Ugh! Disgusting. Terrible.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.699
Mm...

10:17.116 --> 10:19.869
We bear ill tidings, All-Maudra.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.830
The Arathim grow increasingly bold.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.957
Ill tidings indeed.

10:25.374 --> 10:28.586
Arathim have been sighted
as far south as the Great Sog.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.838
Another rebellion appears...

10:31.422 --> 10:32.465
inevitable.

10:33.174 --> 10:36.761
The Vapra stand ready to defend Thra.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.221
Ha! Exemplary!

10:39.597 --> 10:42.975
We require the seven strongest Gelfling
from each clan.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.480
They will have the privilege
of fighting alongside their lords.

10:47.813 --> 10:52.401
Of course, we cannot guarantee
the volunteers' safe return.

10:52.693 --> 10:57.573
Perhaps the Arathim's aggression
has something to do with the blight.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.825
-There is no blight!
-General, I--

10:59.909 --> 11:02.244
You will present us with seven volunteers.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.332
We will take them with us
when we depart tonight. That is all!

11:06.999 --> 11:09.502
As you wish, my lords.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.353
-Don't.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.188
Ugh.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.650
Hm, better.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.785
Struggle is pointless,

11:42.868 --> 11:47.665
but Gelfling is welcome to try
if helps pass time.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.458
Don't play with your food, coward.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.252
Just kill me now.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.628
Kill?

11:53.170 --> 11:56.799
Not kill.
Dead Rian is no good to Chamberlain.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.803
No good to Skeksis. Need Rian alive.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.680
So you can drain my essence?

12:02.763 --> 12:06.976
So Rian can stand before Gelfling
and say lied about Skeksis.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.894
That'll never happen.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.856
I'll make sure that all of Thra
knows what you truly are.

12:11.939 --> 12:14.942
And what are Skeksis? Hmm?

12:15.359 --> 12:16.193
Evil.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.614
Delightful. How are Skeksis evil?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.992
Please, you tell.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.201
You killed Mira.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.455
All things kill.

12:28.289 --> 12:32.209
Is z'nid bird evil
because it eats crawling Nurloc?

12:32.376 --> 12:33.711
Birds eat to live.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.629
So do Skeksis.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.091
All living things consume other things
to survive.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.886
Not evil. Natural.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.096
There was nothing natural
about what you did to Mira.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.725
Death is unnatural. Death is cruel joke.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.686
Death mocks life, mocks Skeksis.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.814
But no more. Skeksis conquer death.

12:54.690 --> 12:59.195
And you, Gelfling,
will do same in Skeksis' place.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.821
We are nothing alike.

13:00.905 --> 13:04.241
When friend being drained,
what did Gelfling do?

13:04.450 --> 13:07.620
Stop us? Fight Skeksis?

13:07.703 --> 13:10.206
-There was nothing I could do.
-You run.

13:10.498 --> 13:14.627
Yes. And when Drenchen friend is caught,
what did Gelfling do?

13:14.960 --> 13:18.005
-Well, Gurjin told me--
-Run, yes? Save self.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.674
And father, too.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.678
Gobbled up by gobbles, so son could run.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.139
Save self.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.557
I tried.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.353
-I just couldn't save him.
-Mm.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.105
Now Gelfling tells truth.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.691
You couldn't save any of them.

13:37.775 --> 13:42.488
But what if Rian could save all the rest?

13:44.156 --> 13:45.366
Mm?

13:52.081 --> 13:53.749
First you erase a Sifan Elder's memory,

13:53.833 --> 13:55.876
then you desert
the Order of Lesser Service.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.421
His memory will probably return
in time. Would you stop... Seladon!

13:59.505 --> 14:01.632
And now I find you scheming

14:01.715 --> 14:03.008
-with a monster beneath the throne.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.636
You make it sound so much more nefarious
than it really is.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.514
I heard you and that thing...

14:08.597 --> 14:10.182
His name is Lore!

14:10.266 --> 14:13.018
...conspiring to end Skeksis rule.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.729
What happens to the Gelfling
if the Skeksis fall?

14:15.813 --> 14:18.107
What happens to Mother?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.359
Is it Mother you're worried about?

14:20.609 --> 14:21.652
Or her crown?

14:21.735 --> 14:22.862
-Why, you--
- Seladon!

14:22.945 --> 14:25.573
-Mother, you must listen to me--
-Mother, I found a secret chamber--

14:25.656 --> 14:27.700
-Enough! Enough! Enough!

14:28.868 --> 14:32.162
Brea, why aren't you
with the Order of Lesser Service?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.707
I ran away,

14:34.790 --> 14:37.251
-but for a very good reason!

14:37.334 --> 14:38.502
I found a secret chamber--

14:38.586 --> 14:42.172
I don't have time
for stories today, Brea.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.549
The lords are here.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.260
The Skeksis are here?

14:46.635 --> 14:49.847
Mother, Brea built a monster
beneath the throne...

14:49.930 --> 14:51.307
-I didn't build him, I awakened him!
-...and she intends to turn it

14:51.390 --> 14:52.349
against the Skeksis.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.809
-And he's not a monster!
- Brea!

14:54.560 --> 14:58.063
You have defied me time and again.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.233
-I mean no disrespect.
-Yes, you do!

15:01.525 --> 15:04.111
To me, to the Skeksis,

15:04.778 --> 15:08.741
to anyone who values tradition
over self-righteous disobedience.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.077
-I value truth!

15:12.745 --> 15:14.705
-I value knowledge.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.791
Right now an ancient creature

15:17.875 --> 15:20.586
holding a mysterious message
is waiting

15:20.669 --> 15:23.881
in a secret chamber beneath your throne!

15:23.964 --> 15:26.133
Don't you want to know what he has to say?

15:27.259 --> 15:30.429
Mother, think of your responsibilities.

15:30.804 --> 15:32.890
Imagine the possibilities.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.520
Show me, Brea.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.230
-But, Mother!
-Seladon,

15:40.314 --> 15:42.816
I'm sending you south
to our Landstrider herds.

15:43.233 --> 15:46.528
I must know more
about this mysterious blight.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.989
But... you need me.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.868
Let me stay and help you.
I... I don't understand.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.747
You will...

15:57.373 --> 15:58.791
when you're All-Maudra.

16:11.887 --> 16:14.765
Now, take me to your monster.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.565
All Gelfling are in danger.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.986
Rian must confess to murder of Mira.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.322
Stand with Skeksis
and silence whispers of rebellion.

16:30.739 --> 16:32.866
Stop war before it starts.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.703
-You don't care about the Gelfling.
-False.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.579
I am friend.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.833
I am only reason Gelfling still alive.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.919
So that we can live as your slaves.

16:44.003 --> 16:47.881
Is Gelfling slave
if Gelfling does not know it is slave?

16:47.965 --> 16:49.967
Now Gelfling happy.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.303
Eating, dancing, drinking...

16:53.512 --> 16:55.180
running like Fizzgig.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.308
-We're not your pets.
-False.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.853
You live only a few trine.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.814
Skeksis are immortal.

17:04.481 --> 17:07.985
We are to you as you are to crawlies.

17:08.068 --> 17:11.739
The choice is pets or enemies.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.074
Choose wisely.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.617
Hm...

17:16.368 --> 17:20.122
And if I say what you want,
will you stop draining Gelfling?

17:20.914 --> 17:22.875
Cannot promise.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.043
Hm.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.669
Then I refuse.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.298
All Gelfling lose,
or few Gelfling lose all!

17:29.381 --> 17:30.924
War is end!

17:31.008 --> 17:33.010
Unless we win.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.178
Halt!

17:43.854 --> 17:46.648
-Fine! Go then.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.902
Run. Have your war!

17:50.069 --> 17:54.948
But it will be on Rian's head
when all Gelfling die

17:55.032 --> 17:57.951
because you chose to run.

17:58.368 --> 17:59.828
Again.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.051
Mm...

18:14.843 --> 18:15.928
Ah...

18:16.053 --> 18:20.349
At last, a Gelfling with sense.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.434
Mm...

18:29.566 --> 18:34.822
Is difficult being voice of reason
in such crazed world.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.596
"Hear the song," Mystic says.

19:00.180 --> 19:03.058
"Only Thra can teach the song,"
Mystic says.

19:03.142 --> 19:07.563
So, Aughra will try Mystic way
to make Thra sing for Aughra.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.111
Ah! Stones are no help! Bah!

19:19.783 --> 19:21.493
Leaves have nothing to say.

19:22.786 --> 19:23.620
No help!

19:26.039 --> 19:27.082
Uh... uh...

19:36.466 --> 19:38.302
Bah! No help!

20:01.116 --> 20:02.784
Smoke is no help!

20:03.410 --> 20:05.204
Mystic ways don't work.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.164
Aughra ways don't work.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.708
Old ways don't work!

20:15.631 --> 20:19.593
Aughra cannot make Thra sing.

20:22.137 --> 20:24.139
-Huh?

20:25.015 --> 20:26.266
-Oh?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.562
What's gotten into you?

20:34.942 --> 20:36.902
No good.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.197
The Darkening has consumed you,
little one.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.700
Aughra cannot help you.
Aughra cannot heal you.

20:43.992 --> 20:45.994
Aughra cannot stop the Darkening.

20:47.371 --> 20:50.457
Aughra cannot even make Thra sing.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.711
No. I have failed you.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.465
I have failed Thra.

21:01.802 --> 21:04.012
Aughra gave Crystal to Skesis.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.306
Foolish.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.934
Aughra made so many mistakes.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.185
Now...

21:10.852 --> 21:12.145
too late for Aughra.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.484
Maybe not too late for you.

21:21.363 --> 21:26.326
Sanctuary Tree, I abandoned you
as I abandoned all my children.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.913
I don't ask for forgiveness.

21:30.497 --> 21:31.915
Do not deserve it.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.334
I beg for your help...

21:35.836 --> 21:37.129
for this creature,

21:38.797 --> 21:42.259
for all who suffer
because of Aughra's mistakes!

21:43.844 --> 21:45.345
Do what Aughra cannot!

21:46.263 --> 21:48.682
Please, I beg of you.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.023
Oh...

22:12.039 --> 22:14.458
Welcome back.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.254
On your way then.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.223
Thank you.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.226
Thank you for listening, old friend.

22:34.978 --> 22:35.896
Hm...

22:36.563 --> 22:38.523
Perhaps that is the lesson.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.984
Instead of making Thra talk,

22:41.610 --> 22:45.030
Aughra will simply sit
with her friend awhile

22:45.322 --> 22:46.948
and listen.

22:47.699 --> 22:48.700
Friend.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.967
Ha'rar is beautiful.

23:07.302 --> 23:08.387
Uh...

23:08.637 --> 23:09.888
What's the white stuff?

23:11.014 --> 23:12.057
-Snow.
-Look at that.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.434
-What is snow?
-Is that a Grottan here in Ha'rar?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.103
<i>Nurishi. </i>Cold.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.979
Move, Podling.

23:19.272 --> 23:22.317
The Gelfling here are all so... different.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.819
Yeah, rude!

23:23.902 --> 23:25.237
Watch out.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.115
Huh?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.870
Hm...

23:36.915 --> 23:39.876
If I couldn't get in to see Maudra Fara
dressed like this,

23:40.168 --> 23:42.838
then we'll never get in
to see the All-Maudra.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.965
-Huh.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.134
Mm!

23:48.051 --> 23:49.678
-Huh?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.097
Hmph!

23:53.181 --> 23:54.266
Right back.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.351
Over here!

23:56.435 --> 23:58.687
- Huh? Whoa!
-Everything for sale! Over here!

24:01.773 --> 24:04.860
I'm going to a party. I need a dress.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.654
-You have come to the right place, madam.

24:07.737 --> 24:09.865
I have many perfect dresses.
Ah!

24:10.031 --> 24:12.159
-Take a look here.
-Oh, no, no, no!

24:12.451 --> 24:15.745
-I want something fun in a somber way.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.789
Past the calf but above the knee.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.499
I see. I see.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.085
-Do not worry. You're safe in my hands.

24:22.169 --> 24:25.130
Maybe I could tunnel my way
into the citadel.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.966
Hm... I’m going to need a big shovel.

24:28.049 --> 24:29.426
You look a vision in blue.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.595
-Oh... ah...
- Pink is out, blue is in.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.474
Uh... I'm not sure.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.225
Or maybe...

24:37.642 --> 24:41.605
I could pretend I have some kind
of illness, like spotted rump-spickle.

24:42.731 --> 24:43.899
I could make an exception.

24:45.066 --> 24:46.443
Pardon me.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.069
I guess I could take a bath.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.656
-We go! We go!
-Hup, where did you get all that?

24:55.535 --> 24:56.995
Ah..

24:58.497 --> 25:00.790
Ha! Muah!

25:02.292 --> 25:03.752
Oh! Um...

25:04.711 --> 25:05.962
How do I look?

25:06.505 --> 25:09.674
Deet always beautiful.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.135
Hup!

25:13.678 --> 25:15.430
I told you already.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.641
I can't let you in.
The All-Maudra is busy.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.728
Please, my wife and I would just like
a few moments of the All-Maudra's time.

25:21.811 --> 25:23.063
It's not going to happen.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.023
-Time for you both to move along.
- I've got to see the All-Maudra!

25:25.106 --> 25:26.525
-If we could just speak with her--
- I said...

25:26.608 --> 25:29.444
This will never work.
They're not going to believe I'm Vapran.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.987
Will work. Watch.

25:31.404 --> 25:32.989
- Who's next?
-Paladin!

25:33.114 --> 25:34.074
-Huh?

25:34.282 --> 25:36.201
-Brother Paladin!
-Hup!

25:36.785 --> 25:38.495
-Mm?
- Wait! No, Hup. Hup!

25:38.578 --> 25:40.914
Protector...

25:45.043 --> 25:46.419
Vapran lady.

25:48.797 --> 25:52.592
Noble quest.
Important message for All-Maudra.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.220
Ooh!
Look at that fancy lady with that Podling.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.432
I shall escort you personally
to the All-Maudra.

26:01.518 --> 26:03.019
Come along inside then.

26:03.645 --> 26:07.148
The rest of you, stay back.
Right this way, my lady.

26:07.232 --> 26:08.900
Hello. Thank you.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.819
Well, it is a lovely dress.

26:11.861 --> 26:12.904
This way, Mother.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.827
All this beneath my throne. I...

26:18.952 --> 26:21.371
- Hm...
-I-- I had no idea.

26:24.457 --> 26:25.625
Easy.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.423
Oh...

26:34.050 --> 26:35.176
This is Lore.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.387
Greetings...

26:38.263 --> 26:39.222
Lore.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.442
Aaah...

26:50.817 --> 26:54.571
This volunteer's teeth
are very disappointing.

26:54.904 --> 26:55.947
Argh.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.158
Weak haunches, too.

27:00.577 --> 27:02.287
What's wrong with that one's face?

27:02.495 --> 27:03.496
Hm?

27:03.955 --> 27:06.041
I think it's just old.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.419
Well, I don't like it. Get it out of here!

27:09.502 --> 27:11.588
Uh...
Go.

27:11.921 --> 27:13.673
I'm not that old.

27:14.507 --> 27:15.425
Hurry.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.218
Faster!

27:21.473 --> 27:24.893
Oh! Red hair possesses a strong aura.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.395
I don't know. Freckles.

27:27.479 --> 27:28.647
-Mm.

27:30.607 --> 27:31.816
Oh...

27:32.275 --> 27:35.320
-I like the ugly one on the end.
-Huh?

27:35.612 --> 27:38.114
-But it's so small.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.034
It's not about size.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.080
It's about... vigor.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.878
Uh...

28:00.762 --> 28:02.430
-Huh?

28:02.806 --> 28:04.474
-Mm?

28:05.016 --> 28:06.309
Huh?

28:07.394 --> 28:08.770
-Mm...

28:09.104 --> 28:10.647
What's that?

28:12.232 --> 28:13.316
-Hello there.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.901
-Gurjin!

28:15.694 --> 28:17.320
-Hey, Rian!
-Huh?

28:17.404 --> 28:19.072
-Naia!
-It’s time to go.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.407
So long!

28:20.490 --> 28:22.826
No!

28:23.201 --> 28:25.578
Gelfling, come back!

28:27.455 --> 28:30.125
-Thank you!
-It's good to see you, Rian.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.334
No!

28:31.876 --> 28:33.002
And you, Gurjin.

28:36.464 --> 28:37.298
Watch out!

28:40.385 --> 28:42.804
Rian! Hold on!

28:47.976 --> 28:49.102
Watch out!

28:51.020 --> 28:52.897
-Jump!

28:58.278 --> 28:59.571
Are you hurt?

29:00.029 --> 29:01.656
No! We're fine!

29:02.991 --> 29:04.033
Whoa!

29:04.200 --> 29:05.827
Speak for yourself!

29:06.870 --> 29:08.455
No! Not good.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.084
Unhook the Armaligs!

29:13.543 --> 29:16.212
-They'll carry us to safety!
-Good plan!

29:21.634 --> 29:23.303
Come on!

29:25.054 --> 29:27.557
Gelfling! No, stop!

29:27.724 --> 29:29.058
Gelfling, stop!

29:29.726 --> 29:32.937
No! Come back, Gelfling!

29:33.897 --> 29:36.024
No! Not good!
Not good!

29:36.107 --> 29:37.567
"Join the guard," they said.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.861
"Nothing ever goes wrong
at the castle," they said.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.113
Come on, Drenchen!

29:48.244 --> 29:51.080
-What's taking so long?
-It's stuck!

29:52.373 --> 29:53.208
Ready?

29:54.793 --> 29:55.710
Hurry, Naia!

29:56.544 --> 29:58.046
Wait! Not yet!

29:59.464 --> 30:00.840
Gelfling!

30:03.384 --> 30:04.677
Let me help.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.390
Almost. Come on! Come on!

30:29.661 --> 30:31.412
-Go!
-Oh... go.

30:39.796 --> 30:40.630
Whoa!

30:49.347 --> 30:50.390
Yes!

30:53.101 --> 30:54.394
Well, that was fun.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.654
So long, Chamberlain!

31:04.821 --> 31:08.116
Gelfling!

31:16.833 --> 31:18.835
Whoa!

31:23.590 --> 31:25.174
Go on. You've earned a rest.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.770
Oh! You've returned.

31:38.187 --> 31:39.606
And, Rian, you're safe!

31:39.689 --> 31:41.274
Yes, I am.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.818
-Thanks to these two.
-Mostly me.<i> </i>

31:44.193 --> 31:47.030
Despite whatever stories
my brother will surely tell you.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.867
-Gurjin, is everything all right?

31:51.326 --> 31:52.243
No.

31:53.119 --> 31:56.247
Just a little tender
after my stay with the Skeksis.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.666
It's so good to see you again.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.753
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Easy.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.047
-Tender, remember?
-Oh...

32:04.172 --> 32:06.257
Of course. I'm sorry.

32:06.341 --> 32:08.676
And I made broth.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.929
-Wow.
- Come along this way.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.430
Ahh!

32:12.597 --> 32:14.265
- Stop.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.684
-Who are these two?
-Princess Seladon,

32:17.226 --> 32:19.812
this Vapran lady
needs to speak with the All-Maudra.

32:20.146 --> 32:24.317
-The All-Maudra is indisposed.
-Oh, please. It's important.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.611
You're no Vapran lady.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.821
Uh... Yes, I am.

32:29.197 --> 32:30.239
No.

32:30.657 --> 32:33.409
You're just wearing Vapran garments.

32:33.618 --> 32:34.535
Poorly.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.579
Well... Uh...

32:36.663 --> 32:38.665
my name is Deet. I'm a Grottan.

32:38.873 --> 32:41.334
I was sent by Maudra Argot
to warn the All-Maudra.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.086
The Sanctuary Tree gifted me
with a vision.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.879
-My apologies, Princess.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.631
She obviously has some frenzy.

32:46.714 --> 32:49.258
-I'll escort them both out immediately.
-I... What? Wait!

32:49.342 --> 32:51.636
-Come on, you two impostors. No!
-The blight is real!

32:51.719 --> 32:53.513
-Thra's in danger! The Darkening is here!
-Out with you, none of this! Come on!

32:53.596 --> 32:54.889
-Wait!

32:56.307 --> 32:58.101
I'll speak with them.

32:59.185 --> 33:01.688
-Alone.
-Yes, Princess.

33:02.939 --> 33:06.859
- Thank you.
-Tell me of this Darkening.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.987
My message is for the All-Maudra.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.739
You can either speak with me,

33:11.906 --> 33:14.325
or you and your ridiculous dress

33:14.409 --> 33:17.704
can slink back to your cave.

33:18.454 --> 33:19.706
Choose.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.666
Uh...

33:23.167 --> 33:26.838
Well, it all began
when I was bitten by a baby Nurloc...

33:30.341 --> 33:31.426
Mm...

33:36.764 --> 33:37.765
Hm...

33:38.099 --> 33:39.976
Mmm...

33:42.103 --> 33:44.105
<i>Deratea.</i>

33:44.897 --> 33:47.900
-So then Hup stole this dress--
-Oh, no tell that.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.777
-And now we're here.
-Mm!

33:49.944 --> 33:51.362
Hmm...

33:51.612 --> 33:54.866
You spin quite the tale, Grottan.

33:55.241 --> 33:57.660
But do you offer any proof?

33:58.244 --> 33:59.328
Dreamfast with me.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.665
When was the last time
you washed your hands?

34:03.207 --> 34:04.792
Why would I ever wash my hands?

34:05.793 --> 34:07.211
<i>Deatea... </i>

34:09.172 --> 34:11.049
<i>Deratea...</i>

34:12.258 --> 34:14.177
<i>Kidakida...</i>

34:15.845 --> 34:17.722
<i>Arugaru.</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:24.979
Brea, I'm sorry I doubted you.

34:26.814 --> 34:30.568
-How did you discover this place?
-Let me show you.

34:33.196 --> 34:36.699
<i>Deatea, Deratea,</i>

34:36.783 --> 34:40.369
<i>Kidakida, Arugaru. </i>

34:40.453 --> 34:42.830
<i>Dea-tea!</i>

34:45.249 --> 34:47.502
My father sacrificed his life...

34:48.920 --> 34:49.921
for me.

34:50.671 --> 34:51.839
I'm sorry, Rian.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.509
He was a good captain.

34:54.884 --> 34:56.469
I grew up in the castle.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.931
I thought I knew
every last Skeksis, but...

35:01.057 --> 35:03.392
I've never seen this one before. It...

35:03.810 --> 35:04.936
It wore a mask.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.521
Show us.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.859
<i>Dea.. tea...</i>

35:13.736 --> 35:15.863
- <i>Kida... kida...</i>

35:16.656 --> 35:19.033
<i>Arugaru. </i>

35:19.617 --> 35:24.914
<i>Deatea, Deratea, Kidakida, Arugaru. </i>

35:24.997 --> 35:30.002
<i>Deatea, Deratea, Kidakida, Arugaru. </i>

35:30.086 --> 35:31.921
<i>Dea... tea...</i>

35:33.172 --> 35:35.341
<i>Dera... tea...</i>

35:37.385 --> 35:39.887
<i>Kida... kida. </i>

35:40.805 --> 35:42.056
<i>Deatea.</i>

35:42.598 --> 35:43.975
<i>Deratea. </i>

35:44.475 --> 35:45.852
<i>Kidakida.</i>

35:47.687 --> 35:49.647
<i>Kida!</i>

35:50.148 --> 35:52.692
<i>Deatea, Deratea,</i>

35:52.775 --> 35:55.319
<i>Kidakida, Arugaru. </i>

35:55.403 --> 35:59.115
<i>Deatea, Deratea, Kidakida...</i>

36:10.251 --> 36:12.712
I'm back in the castle. But how?

36:16.549 --> 36:18.092
I hear it!

36:18.467 --> 36:20.052
I hear it!

36:27.143 --> 36:30.229
Oh! I feel the Song of Thra in my heart.

36:30.313 --> 36:32.690
Longneck was right!

36:32.815 --> 36:35.276
I see all the paths laid before me!

36:35.359 --> 36:36.861
-Whoo!
-Huh?

36:37.695 --> 36:40.698
Ha! Ha, ha, ha!

36:40.823 --> 36:42.033
Ha!

36:45.328 --> 36:47.163
Oo-ooh!

36:47.288 --> 36:48.497
Ooh-wah!

36:49.999 --> 36:51.876
-Rian!
-Hm?

36:52.251 --> 36:54.128
-Deet!
-What is this place?

36:54.212 --> 36:57.882
-It's the Skeksis Castle.
- Wrong, brave Rian.

36:57.965 --> 36:59.800
Wrong!

36:59.967 --> 37:01.510
This is Dream Space.

37:06.807 --> 37:08.184
What is she doing?

37:08.726 --> 37:11.437
-Mother Aughra?
- Yes, gentle Deet.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.022
I have returned.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.107
She's dancing!

37:16.692 --> 37:18.694
Ha, ha, oh!

37:19.070 --> 37:20.488
There's the rest of you.

37:20.571 --> 37:21.989
Huh?

37:24.533 --> 37:26.244
- Hello.
- Hm.

37:26.744 --> 37:28.246
-My...
-Hello.

37:29.997 --> 37:31.999
Welcome, clever Brea.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.254
The Crystal, it's cracked.
It's missing a shard.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.756
Quiet! I'm not done.

37:38.839 --> 37:41.467
-Sorry.
- Now, where was I?

37:41.550 --> 37:43.219
Ah! Yes.

37:43.886 --> 37:46.222
Welcome, proud All-Maudra.

37:46.305 --> 37:47.223
Mm.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.350
-Fierce Naia.
-Ha.

37:49.642 --> 37:52.728
-Wise Kylan and Gurjin.
-Hm.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.690
-That's it? Just Gurjin?

37:56.315 --> 37:57.984
How did we come to this place?

37:58.401 --> 38:01.821
-We were dreamfasting, and--
-Me too! I was in Ha'rar.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.448
Ah... body still is.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.827
The Dream Space is a spirit realm.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.203
Dream Space?

38:09.620 --> 38:13.082
The source of magic and prophecy.

38:13.207 --> 38:16.127
-The world within our world.
-Exactly.

38:16.460 --> 38:20.548
The Crystal of Truth has brought you here
to ask for your help.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.801
Our world is dying.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.306
We all have a part to play
in restoring the balance

38:28.472 --> 38:31.017
-and defeating the Skeksis.
- Treason.

38:33.185 --> 38:34.645
Loyal Seladon.

38:34.729 --> 38:38.816
We are nothing without the Skeksis,
Mother. Remember who you serve!

38:38.899 --> 38:43.029
I remember, Seladon. I serve Thra.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.947
This isn't the will of Thra.

38:45.531 --> 38:49.368
This is a sordid plot
of a power-hungry witch!

38:49.452 --> 38:51.787
- Oh!
-Stop, Seladon!

38:51.871 --> 38:53.414
-I don't see--
-Me!

38:53.789 --> 38:55.124
You never see me!

38:56.334 --> 38:57.209
Seladon.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.672
Will you not heed Thra's call?

39:02.048 --> 39:06.218
I will not give in to chaos!

39:08.220 --> 39:09.221
Pity.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.976
Wha-- wha?

39:15.353 --> 39:18.731
-What have you done with my daughter?
-I sent her back.

39:18.981 --> 39:20.900
Different Gelfling, different paths.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.361
Now, gather round.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.197
-You!
-No hurt Deet!

39:26.739 --> 39:30.493
-More traitors! Paladins!
-Oh! Oh!

39:30.576 --> 39:33.287
The citadel is infested with traitors.

39:33.579 --> 39:36.457
I shall inform
the Skeksis lords personally.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.211
-Don't let these two out of your sight!
-Wake up.

39:40.419 --> 39:41.504
Deet, wake!

39:41.837 --> 39:42.671
Deet!

39:44.673 --> 39:45.549
Good!

39:46.008 --> 39:49.345
Now, feel the power of the Crystal!

39:50.888 --> 39:54.058
Come on, then. That's it! Hurry up!

39:57.853 --> 39:58.938
What's happening?

39:59.021 --> 40:01.690
Behold, Thra cries out to you.

40:01.774 --> 40:05.403
Listen close.
Each one of you is part of the song.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.197
It's time all of you heard the truth.

40:12.451 --> 40:15.079
Yes! That's it!

40:15.538 --> 40:17.706
Now you will see!

40:18.582 --> 40:20.251
Behold!

40:49.780 --> 40:51.532
Mira!

40:52.575 --> 40:54.743
-Mine! My turn!
-I want some!

40:54.952 --> 40:56.370
I demand a taste!

41:00.458 --> 41:02.710
-The Skeksis!
-They're draining us!

41:02.793 --> 41:04.128
The volunteers!

41:04.211 --> 41:07.298
-We shall answer Thra's call.
-Good.

41:07.840 --> 41:10.384
-You must travel to Ha'rar, Rian.
- Hm.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.136
Join Brea and Deet.

41:12.720 --> 41:17.057
Together, you three will follow Lore
to the Circle of the Suns

41:17.141 --> 41:20.394
where the key
to ending Skeksis power waits.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.646
And where does our path lead,
Mother Aughra?

41:22.730 --> 41:24.773
To the Seven Corners of Thra.

41:25.399 --> 41:29.403
The clans must know the horrible truth
about the Skeksis.

41:29.820 --> 41:33.324
You must light the Fires of Resistance!

41:33.407 --> 41:35.784
The first fire already blazes.

41:36.243 --> 41:40.247
Ha'rar and the Vapra
will stand against the Skeksis!

41:40.331 --> 41:43.375
Now go, you heroes of Thra.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.878
Go and save our world!

41:55.095 --> 41:55.971
Deet.

41:56.722 --> 42:00.059
We can't allow the Skeksis to leave
with the volunteers. Come!

42:00.726 --> 42:03.812
No! Wait here. I will return.

42:07.483 --> 42:09.193
Now, get in the wagon.

42:10.611 --> 42:13.280
Go! You too, Freckles.

42:15.658 --> 42:16.992
Ah...

42:21.330 --> 42:22.790
-My lords.

42:22.873 --> 42:26.210
Forgive the interruption,
but I must speak with you.

42:26.293 --> 42:29.046
-You are always welcome, Princess.
-Yes.

42:29.672 --> 42:30.589
Thank you.

42:32.007 --> 42:33.592
Which Princess is this?

42:33.676 --> 42:37.054
Haven't got a clue.
They all look the same to me.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.098
-Mm...

42:39.640 --> 42:43.185
Now, what vexes you, child?

42:43.269 --> 42:45.145
Traitors conspire against you.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.403
Come. Tell us everything.

42:56.865 --> 42:57.700
Deet!

42:58.200 --> 42:59.493
-Brea!
- Paladins!

42:59.577 --> 43:01.829
Stand down! These are not our enemies.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.831
Apologies, All-Maudra.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.293
All-Maudra!

43:07.751 --> 43:08.586
Oh...

43:09.295 --> 43:10.504
Uh...

43:13.090 --> 43:16.176
-Not now, Hup.
-Is this Podling in his right mind?

43:16.510 --> 43:18.012
He wants to be a Paladin.

43:18.095 --> 43:20.639
No time for ceremony now, Podling.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.433
Innocent lives are at risk.

43:22.933 --> 43:27.438
Stand and prove the strength
of your spoon by my side.

43:29.064 --> 43:29.898
Hup!

43:30.774 --> 43:32.401
Let's hope we're not too late.

43:37.156 --> 43:39.450
This is invaluable information, Princess.

43:39.533 --> 43:41.452
Get away from my daughter.

43:41.827 --> 43:42.911
What now?

43:45.289 --> 43:51.003
The Princess was just sharing
a very distressing story.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.048
Seladon, you have to stop!
You don't know what you're doing!

43:54.423 --> 43:57.635
-I know exactly what I'm doing.
-I demand

43:57.718 --> 44:00.721
-you release my Paladins.
-Release?

44:00.971 --> 44:04.058
They are not prisoners.
They are volunteers.

44:04.433 --> 44:07.144
They are under my protection.

44:08.103 --> 44:11.231
I am the All-Maudra!

44:11.315 --> 44:12.524
Mother, don't.

44:12.608 --> 44:16.153
You are All-Maudra
because we allow you to be All-Maudra.

44:16.236 --> 44:18.155
And as All-Maudra,

44:18.489 --> 44:23.202
I have turned a blind eye and said nothing

44:24.078 --> 44:27.498
-while you steal from Gelfling. No more!

44:28.207 --> 44:33.796
I have allowed you to buy my loyalty
with cheap trinkets.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.757
-No more!
-Bah!

44:36.924 --> 44:39.510
I have bowed my head

44:39.718 --> 44:43.555
and called you lords while you drained us!

44:44.431 --> 44:47.893
But... no... more!

44:48.727 --> 44:50.771
-Then you are no more!

44:53.649 --> 44:54.525
No!

45:00.864 --> 45:01.865
Mother!

45:02.825 --> 45:03.659
Mother.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.453
No! All-Maudra!

45:10.958 --> 45:11.792
Please, no.

45:12.292 --> 45:14.044
Ah! Mother!

45:19.091 --> 45:20.426
She's dead.

45:24.138 --> 45:27.182
-It's your fault.
-No!

45:30.519 --> 45:31.562
Shh...

45:32.104 --> 45:34.314
Come. Come, Princess.

45:35.941 --> 45:37.943
There's nothing you could have done.

45:38.569 --> 45:41.488
You said yourself.
Your mother was a traitor.

45:41.905 --> 45:42.740
You...

45:44.158 --> 45:45.826
<i>You</i> are loyal.

45:46.827 --> 45:47.870
Always.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.998
You know then what you must do.

45:52.791 --> 45:53.625
No.

45:54.293 --> 45:55.335
It's not too late.

45:56.628 --> 45:59.256
Think of Mother. And Tavra.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.924
Paladins!

46:01.008 --> 46:02.760
-Huh?

46:03.802 --> 46:06.388
-Take these traitors away!
- No! Wait!

46:07.014 --> 46:08.515
- Move.

46:09.224 --> 46:10.309
- Please!
-Seladon!

46:11.351 --> 46:12.352
You're my sister!

46:12.436 --> 46:14.688
- Come.
-You are no sister of mine.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.231
Seladon! No!

46:17.107 --> 46:18.817
-Please!

46:18.942 --> 46:19.943
Seladon!

46:22.404 --> 46:23.238
No!

46:24.323 --> 46:27.034
You've been through a terrible ordeal.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.746
Justice must be served.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.457
Best we take the troublemakers?

46:34.500 --> 46:35.417
Yes.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.211
Of course.

46:37.961 --> 46:38.962
Thank you.

46:40.214 --> 46:41.465
Our pleasure...

46:42.382 --> 46:43.759
All-Maudra.

46:44.176 --> 46:45.844
All-Maudra.
