WEBVTT

00:10.922 --> 00:14.448
Every lawman's still out
there looking for the Geckos.

00:14.853 --> 00:17.028
We need new passports, we need new names.

00:17.048 --> 00:18.878
- I want to get out of here.
- And go where?

00:18.941 --> 00:20.339
To find Scott.

00:20.379 --> 00:21.711
Until she's back,

00:21.940 --> 00:24.354
this place is shut down.

00:29.034 --> 00:30.527
Time to regulate.

00:31.913 --> 00:34.367
- Stick a fork in 'em. They're done.
- Or they're just getting started.

00:34.764 --> 00:38.409
If we are gonna fight this war,

00:38.449 --> 00:40.541
we have to let go of who we
were, to become who we are.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.818
And now begins the ancient word.

00:48.938 --> 00:51.745
The sun sleeps below the sky,

00:52.122 --> 00:54.658
and the world turns upside down.

00:54.993 --> 00:57.831
In the night, we make our feast.

01:00.265 --> 01:04.193
For centuries I danced for
them, the blood-gatherer,

01:04.239 --> 01:06.086
the bringer of souls.

01:06.171 --> 01:08.274
I've brought them the lost ones,

01:08.394 --> 01:12.067
the troubled ones, the desperate ones.

01:13.036 --> 01:15.761
Now I am free,

01:15.988 --> 01:19.121
and the world turns upside down again.

01:19.774 --> 01:22.181
They are thirsty for revenge,

01:22.195 --> 01:23.896
and nothing will stop them.

01:23.956 --> 01:26.565
No boundaries, no borders.

01:26.603 --> 01:28.222
They will come for me,

01:28.464 --> 01:30.864
but I am coming for them.

01:30.984 --> 01:33.317
Their empire of blood will fall,

01:33.437 --> 01:39.068
and I will not rest until it all burns.

01:39.677 --> 01:41.032
Let me tell you something.

01:42.469 --> 01:45.778
And I know that you habla ingles,
so don't even give me that look.

01:46.988 --> 01:48.452
I am not your enemy,

01:48.797 --> 01:50.469
and I am not your friend.

01:50.916 --> 01:53.456
I am simply here for what is mine.

01:54.112 --> 01:56.350
Now I understand that it was yours,

01:56.990 --> 02:00.385
but due to the unwritten rules
of this life that you chose,

02:00.709 --> 02:02.371
it now belongs to me.

02:03.512 --> 02:04.911
So I'm gonna take it.

02:05.031 --> 02:07.138
This is who I am, you understand?

02:07.768 --> 02:09.183
It's what I do.

02:09.436 --> 02:11.435
But thank you for your cooperation.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.021
Adios.

02:33.511 --> 02:35.258
Holy shit, you're back!

02:43.750 --> 02:45.552
Oh, my God.

02:45.902 --> 02:47.435
What did you do?

03:06.886 --> 03:08.125
Jefe.

03:17.386 --> 03:18.719
A trucker?

03:19.728 --> 03:21.337
That the best you can do?

03:21.885 --> 03:23.192
Jefe, it's Carlos.

03:23.475 --> 03:25.027
He's free.

03:25.678 --> 03:27.125
He beat the labyrinth.

03:27.566 --> 03:28.987
Don't ask me how.

03:29.761 --> 03:31.704
Can't wait to hear all about it.

04:06.904 --> 04:09.168
You gotta take care of the hide, vato.

04:12.003 --> 04:14.268
Never know when I'm gonna need it.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.384
_

04:19.170 --> 04:21.041
_

04:21.161 --> 04:22.616
That's hardcore.

04:24.324 --> 04:26.271
You've been reeducated.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.735
Show me what you've learned.

04:30.801 --> 04:32.142
The bonds.

04:32.402 --> 04:35.504
You had the Gecko brothers
steal them for you.

04:36.816 --> 04:39.054
There's a message hidden inside them,

04:39.174 --> 04:42.906
a prophecy about a source of
blood that will feed us all.

04:43.756 --> 04:47.194
"And a storm of blood shall come

04:47.232 --> 04:50.143
unlike anything the world has seen.

04:51.540 --> 04:53.847
It will quench our thirst."

04:56.469 --> 04:58.685
And the rest is... porquería.

04:58.733 --> 05:01.737
If you ask me, all
prophecies are gibberish,

05:01.773 --> 05:04.135
but everybody wants to believe them, so...

05:04.199 --> 05:07.062
What can I do? I play along.

05:09.198 --> 05:11.291
Tell me what it means!

05:16.525 --> 05:18.731
Did you ever watch that show

05:18.742 --> 05:21.274
with the little Mexicanita
and her backpack?

05:21.394 --> 05:23.982
- What is he talking about?
- This is a waste of time.

05:24.036 --> 05:25.348
Dora the Explorer.

05:25.391 --> 05:28.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a cartoon with
the girl, and she has a monkey, and...

05:29.302 --> 05:31.615
They... they do these things, and...

05:32.346 --> 05:35.510
- I think he's lost it.
- The bonds are the map.

05:36.607 --> 05:40.432
- I'm the map.
- A map to buried treasure buried in nonsense?

05:40.475 --> 05:41.895
Jefe, it's pointless.

05:42.164 --> 05:44.214
The labyrinth turned his mind to mush.

05:44.334 --> 05:47.175
The guy with the answer, he's close by.

05:47.295 --> 05:49.702
I know because I...
'cause I brought him here,

05:49.735 --> 05:51.602
'cause I... 'cause I brought him here,

05:51.661 --> 05:54.425
along with los hermanos Gecko.

05:54.619 --> 05:57.320
He's trapped in the bowels of this place.

05:57.499 --> 05:59.049
He's playing us, Jefe.

06:02.137 --> 06:05.309
Find him, Carlos. And find the answer.

06:06.425 --> 06:08.592
And you can have Narcisso's job.

Hey! Hey!

06:49.384 --> 06:50.383
Hey!

06:51.887 --> 06:55.872
Help! Help, I'm in here!

06:56.846 --> 06:58.325
I'm in here!

07:03.109 --> 07:04.551
Oh, thank God!

07:06.886 --> 07:08.828
You really screwed the pooch, Ponch.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.705
And by the way...

07:12.755 --> 07:15.042
Earl says sorry doesn't cut it.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.065
Gonzalez.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.292
Hey man, wake your ass up.

07:35.297 --> 07:36.970
We got big doings out
here in the countryside.

07:36.975 --> 07:38.230
What the hell you talking about?

07:38.234 --> 07:41.289
Just get your ass out to the
quarry, ok? I'll see you soon.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.790
What are you doing?

07:51.345 --> 07:52.271
I got called in.

07:52.330 --> 07:55.542
Babe, I can't ever wake up
with these stupid shutters.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.297
Just got to keep 'em
shut, especially at night.

07:58.507 --> 08:00.921
Just 'cause some bad guys threatened you?

08:03.849 --> 08:05.522
They're really bad guys.

08:05.594 --> 08:07.598
Ranger, you're soaked!

08:08.857 --> 08:11.036
It's your turn to take her to daycare.

08:11.111 --> 08:12.096
Really?

08:13.554 --> 08:14.634
Yes.

09:15.702 --> 09:17.530
Hi. Hi, sweetie.

09:18.295 --> 09:20.656
- Okay. We'll see you later.
- Bye, sweetie.

09:20.898 --> 09:22.369
Okay, bye.

09:46.313 --> 09:48.189
- It's them.
- You sure?

09:48.309 --> 09:50.314
I mean, they're pretty crispy.

09:50.798 --> 09:52.527
I can confirm without a doubt that these

09:52.554 --> 09:54.121
are the bodies of Seth and Richard Gecko,

09:54.127 --> 09:55.918
the infamous bank robbers,

09:56.038 --> 09:59.289
probably the most infamous
criminal duo in Texas history.

09:59.323 --> 10:02.502
The crime scene does have the makings
of an underworld contract killing.

10:02.544 --> 10:06.712
An ongoing investigation will ascertain
which of these shattered group is responsible.

10:06.832 --> 10:07.914
Thanks.

10:08.403 --> 10:09.799
I don't know why I lied.

10:11.190 --> 10:12.611
Damn.

10:13.422 --> 10:15.015
Even that's a lie.

10:15.453 --> 10:17.173
I know exactly why I said it.

10:17.259 --> 10:19.847
You're making a big mistake, Ranger.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.859
This is what's gonna happen:

10:21.892 --> 10:24.211
I'm gonna drop this stake and
I'm gonna walk out of here.

10:24.253 --> 10:27.901
And none of you freaks better
come after me or my family.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.961
_

10:37.171 --> 10:39.301
I followed them to the gate of hell, Earl.

10:39.581 --> 10:40.497
I did.

10:42.991 --> 10:44.889
But I couldn't finish the job.

10:46.272 --> 10:48.656
I've got to protect Margaret and Billy.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.792
But there's something else.

10:53.298 --> 10:55.011
Did you find any symbols?

10:55.251 --> 10:56.129
Symbols?

10:56.338 --> 10:57.297
Yeah.

10:57.382 --> 10:59.299
Messages? Markings? Anything?

11:00.115 --> 11:01.201
Freddie,

11:01.874 --> 11:03.353
you've got two dead felons

11:03.385 --> 11:05.511
looking like a couple of chicharrónes, and

11:05.631 --> 11:07.179
you're looking for a message?

11:07.383 --> 11:08.874
No, man, no message.

11:09.288 --> 11:10.143
Why?

11:10.395 --> 11:12.479
Now I can't escape the feeling

11:12.683 --> 11:14.146
that something's coming.

11:17.825 --> 11:19.369
And I can't stop it.

11:21.490 --> 11:23.456
I'm gonna need you help me see it...

11:24.626 --> 11:25.959
before it hits.

11:33.502 --> 11:35.601
God!

11:36.138 --> 11:38.471
Aah! Aah!

12:32.933 --> 12:34.580
They're not done yet.

12:35.828 --> 12:37.623
They're not done but
you said they would be.

12:37.646 --> 12:38.808
Tomorrow.

12:39.566 --> 12:41.589
Look, I don't have that kind of time.

12:41.614 --> 12:43.197
I'm on the clock.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.452
What?

12:53.317 --> 12:54.511
Listen.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.877
I'm leaving.

12:56.963 --> 12:59.272
Ok? It's... it's... it's best we don't

12:59.277 --> 13:01.069
start anything we can't finish.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.215
Doesn't have to be the beginning.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.711
It can be the end.

13:08.752 --> 13:10.221
Maybe if things were different.

13:20.405 --> 13:21.573
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.714
Fast as you can.

13:35.293 --> 13:36.547
It's the wrong key.

13:36.595 --> 13:38.370
No, it's a bump key.

13:38.575 --> 13:41.653
Ok? And in a perfect world,
they'd have a snap gun for this.

13:41.773 --> 13:43.822
Quick as nick, but this is Mexico.

13:43.854 --> 13:45.224
We gotta make do with what we got.

13:45.237 --> 13:47.065
Watch. Like this.

13:48.050 --> 13:49.658
It's all in the reflexes.

13:49.778 --> 13:50.901
Now you try.

13:54.969 --> 13:56.589
Did you at least see the safe?

13:56.594 --> 13:57.907
I did, yes.

13:57.945 --> 14:00.447
It's a good score, Kate. It's gonna play.

14:00.844 --> 14:02.749
If we work out all the moves.

14:02.787 --> 14:04.336
- We've got to review 'em.
- Trying.

14:04.456 --> 14:06.780
This beauty school dropout,
the one with the helmet hair,

14:07.081 --> 14:10.637
she's got a direct-to-DVD bodyguard
watching the front of her place.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.012
Yeah, that's Tocayo.

14:12.055 --> 14:15.072
And the collector's supposed to have
another guy with him tomorrow, Chino.

14:15.094 --> 14:15.966
Splendid.

14:16.493 --> 14:17.935
Any other surprises?

14:17.946 --> 14:20.340
Rafa says they sit there
in the beauty parlor waiting

14:20.345 --> 14:21.846
for the collector to do his thing.

14:21.966 --> 14:23.234
I'm sorry, Rafa?

14:24.471 --> 14:26.995
Rafael. I... I told you about him.

14:27.221 --> 14:29.824
Yeah, he's... he's my
connection on this whole thing.

14:29.857 --> 14:30.890
Your connection?

14:31.083 --> 14:33.100
You been reading one too
many paperback originals?

14:33.321 --> 14:34.967
He is going to be our lookout.

14:35.010 --> 14:38.308
Slow down, ok? The last thing I need
is another mouth to feed around here.

14:53.468 --> 14:55.335
That doesn't make any sense.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.110
It's Richard.

14:59.611 --> 15:02.016
He's trying to throw off the cops.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.584
Again. Go.

15:17.856 --> 15:19.901
Congratulations. We're both dead.

15:23.074 --> 15:24.882
No wonder he left you.

15:26.803 --> 15:27.918
Excuse me?

15:28.004 --> 15:30.721
I said no wonder he drove
you both off a cliff.

15:30.807 --> 15:32.311
Who would want to work with you?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.609
Okay. No mas.

15:35.222 --> 15:36.693
I'm calling this whole thing off.

15:36.713 --> 15:37.848
You're not ready.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.694
And every spidey sense I got is tingling

15:40.705 --> 15:43.750
in every nook and cranny
from eyeballs to balls-balls.

15:43.756 --> 15:45.402
- Nice.
- Forget it. We're gonna wait.

15:45.418 --> 15:47.446
- We're gonna try and figure something out.
- Wait for what?

15:47.907 --> 15:49.372
Get another tattoo? Or

15:49.389 --> 15:51.906
or maybe better yet, for
you to go on another trip?

15:51.944 --> 15:53.800
You want to shoot yourself
with some more heroin?

15:54.182 --> 15:56.081
You're just angry because Richie left you.

15:56.097 --> 15:57.975
And you don't know what to
do with yourself anymore.

15:58.002 --> 15:58.869
He didn't leave.

15:59.035 --> 16:02.580
- He was taken by something nasty and unholy.
- And real.

16:03.199 --> 16:04.646
They're out there, and...

16:04.707 --> 16:08.553
Pretending that they don't exist
isn't gonna make them not exist.

16:08.673 --> 16:10.194
You know another thing?

16:10.265 --> 16:13.992
I didn't just lose my brother down
in that temple, I lost my dad, too.

16:16.468 --> 16:18.419
He begged me to kill him, and I

16:18.539 --> 16:21.599
drove a stake into his heart.

16:22.347 --> 16:25.156
You don't see me shooting
myself full of poison.

16:38.407 --> 16:39.990
You never told me that.

16:55.644 --> 16:57.391
They're dying to know how you did it.

16:58.291 --> 16:59.259
Did what?

16:59.379 --> 17:00.744
You know, beat the labyrinth.

17:00.847 --> 17:02.513
They say it makes men insane.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.381
Eat their own shit, drink their piss.

17:04.397 --> 17:07.151
Haven't had to do that
since the 16th century.

17:09.021 --> 17:10.928
So what did you do in there?

17:11.305 --> 17:13.262
Why'd they make you take your fangs out?

17:14.359 --> 17:15.694
They didn't.

17:16.271 --> 17:17.653
Wait, what?

17:18.364 --> 17:21.236
You mean you actually...

17:30.090 --> 17:31.930
You really think he's down here?

17:32.210 --> 17:35.206
I know what parts of
this place turn him on.

17:35.681 --> 17:36.597
Yeah?

17:38.504 --> 17:40.806
I don't see any teenage girls around here.

17:59.238 --> 18:00.857
Did you miss me?

18:06.162 --> 18:07.077
Hey.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.531
What are you doing?

18:12.290 --> 18:14.603
I told you, this is for
a case I'm working on.

18:15.298 --> 18:18.973
Right. The one that gives you
nightmares and keeps you up all hours?

18:19.091 --> 18:20.663
What is this case about?

18:20.684 --> 18:23.052
You've been jotting down all kind
of strange stuff in your notebook.

18:23.068 --> 18:24.644
You're not supposed to go through that.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.982
- Then don't leave it lying around!
- Don't look.

18:31.622 --> 18:32.603
Margaret.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.851
I don't care how many shutters you put up

18:34.878 --> 18:36.277
or weapons you hide in the furniture

18:36.304 --> 18:38.660
I am not feeling real safe right now.

18:43.894 --> 18:46.073
By the way, it's astronomy.

18:46.193 --> 18:48.102
- What?
- According to this

18:48.222 --> 18:50.087
Professor Aiden Tanner,

18:50.259 --> 18:54.044
those symbols of yours have to do
with mathematics and mapping the stars.

18:54.691 --> 18:57.176
Should have asked the girl
who went to grad school.

18:57.296 --> 18:58.877
I marked the page.

19:59.241 --> 20:00.615
Hey!

20:01.444 --> 20:02.576
Pinche, Freddie!

20:02.826 --> 20:05.274
Could have boiled my ***,
man. Don't sneak up on me!

20:05.301 --> 20:06.893
I shouldn't be able to sneak up on someone

20:06.904 --> 20:09.750
- who's supposed to be watching my house.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:10.336 --> 20:12.634
- I've got to take off.
- All right.

20:13.089 --> 20:14.538
Made you a sandwich.

20:43.570 --> 20:45.824
_

21:07.510 --> 21:09.423
Congratulations, Tex Magellan.

21:16.681 --> 21:18.682
I'm coming! I'm coming!

21:20.000 --> 21:22.569
Hold on! Where are you?

21:38.537 --> 21:40.871
No! God!

22:33.482 --> 22:34.244
Right there.

22:34.885 --> 22:36.882
First the Geckos, now this?

22:37.253 --> 22:39.270
Shit man, you getting paid by the corpse?

22:40.524 --> 22:42.848
So how the hell did you
find this place anyway?

22:43.365 --> 22:45.264
Anonymous tip.

22:46.754 --> 22:47.813
What have we got?

22:48.352 --> 22:50.698
M.E.'s guess is they died six weeks ago.

22:50.730 --> 22:51.950
Illegals.

22:52.069 --> 22:54.673
It's been a dry month, so
they're pretty well preserved.

22:54.905 --> 22:58.623
And every one of them's got these
symbols carved into their foreheads.

22:58.742 --> 23:01.177
You were asking me about symbols on
the Geckos, what's that all about?

23:01.211 --> 23:02.627
Any cause of death yet?

23:02.844 --> 23:03.748
Negative,

23:04.162 --> 23:05.948
but they've all got the same wound.

23:06.884 --> 23:08.300
Bite mark to the neck.

23:09.612 --> 23:11.377
Holy crap. How'd you know?

23:12.923 --> 23:15.094
Every vic had their knees
smashed with something heavy.

23:15.121 --> 23:18.433
And big. Kept them from
scurrying away, I guess.

23:20.814 --> 23:22.097
Help!

23:22.380 --> 23:24.599
- Buried alive.
- What?

23:24.882 --> 23:27.389
They're buried alive. They
had their knees smashed to

23:27.459 --> 23:30.057
keep them from running away.
Some kind of ritual killing.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.983
Some kind of sick-ass
shit is what that would be.

23:32.031 --> 23:34.393
Sir, I think I got something.

23:34.411 --> 23:36.308
Whatever weapon the killer used

23:36.653 --> 23:38.304
had this glass in it.

23:40.084 --> 23:41.505
Obsidian.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.178
That's trippy.

23:43.496 --> 23:44.776
What do you think?

23:48.893 --> 23:50.842
I think it's time to find an expert.

23:51.378 --> 23:54.100
After el más macho Ranger Gonzalez

23:54.131 --> 23:57.413
rammed me through and left me for
dead, I thought it was curtains.

23:57.613 --> 24:00.798
But then someone or something

24:01.021 --> 24:02.789
found me down there.

24:05.855 --> 24:07.835
And they gave me the gift.

24:10.697 --> 24:12.147
Immortality.

24:15.766 --> 24:18.876
And one other little fringe benefit

24:18.996 --> 24:22.073
that we won't talk about right now.

24:22.159 --> 24:23.325
Shh!

24:30.077 --> 24:32.384
So this is the famous professor.

24:34.349 --> 24:37.378
Well, thanks for finding him, Carlitos.

24:37.690 --> 24:38.938
He's mine now.

24:39.153 --> 24:40.547
He's ours.

24:40.805 --> 24:42.285
Back off or I'll stick him.

24:42.306 --> 24:43.457
No, you won't.

24:43.856 --> 24:45.020
He's too valuable.

24:45.346 --> 24:46.638
Carlos knows this.

24:46.901 --> 24:49.601
I feel like the prettiest
girl at the winter formal.

24:49.632 --> 24:50.567
Shut up.

24:50.774 --> 24:52.963
Back away. Tell him, Carlos.

25:01.553 --> 25:02.597
Let him go.

25:03.647 --> 25:04.518
What?

25:04.583 --> 25:06.746
What are you talking about?
He's our ticket with the boss.

25:13.832 --> 25:15.908
You gotta be freaking kidding me.

25:24.005 --> 25:26.717
I must say, I like this new Carlitos.

25:31.144 --> 25:32.310
No.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.367
You keep the toy.

26:02.716 --> 26:04.276
_

26:04.396 --> 26:05.933
_

26:06.665 --> 26:09.635
Well that's what you get when
you troll for underage girls.

26:10.065 --> 26:12.695
You told me to lure
him down here, so I did.

26:13.378 --> 26:15.240
I'm glad I met you, Katerina.

26:17.403 --> 26:20.426
It's Kate. Please call me Kate.

26:21.042 --> 26:23.632
I like Katerina, and
you have no say in this.

26:23.670 --> 26:25.736
Actually, I think I could just ignore you.

26:25.757 --> 26:28.598
I am impossible to ignore.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.936
So we're gonna get into the
back of the beauty parlor

26:35.969 --> 26:38.459
and get the cash from this safe
while her bodyguard sits there?

26:38.502 --> 26:41.697
Yes, we are. While Frick
and Frack park it here,

26:41.751 --> 26:44.452
you're gonna go in and
get your hair "did", ok?

26:44.764 --> 26:47.794
Tell Ma Barker you need to
use the juanito, or whatever

26:47.831 --> 26:49.693
and then pop the lock
exactly like we practised.

26:49.813 --> 26:51.973
- Got it.
- So, uh,

26:52.755 --> 26:54.167
you...

26:55.058 --> 26:58.028
you run this little bodega
over here, is that correct?

26:58.148 --> 27:00.377
It's a botánica. There's a difference.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.033
So you a true believer?

27:03.403 --> 27:04.643
In what?

27:05.660 --> 27:07.618
In that shit you sell there.

27:12.594 --> 27:14.037
Business seems to be good.

27:14.414 --> 27:16.044
It's all snake oil to me.

27:17.411 --> 27:19.326
I don't know, it's
funny, you know the people

27:19.358 --> 27:21.051
buying that shit from you,

27:21.344 --> 27:24.172
Call me crazy, I don't really
consider them people at all.

27:26.677 --> 27:27.759
What do you think?

27:29.846 --> 27:31.087
I don't ask.

27:31.458 --> 27:33.325
I just take their money.

27:35.934 --> 27:37.235
Good.

28:07.695 --> 28:09.298
Can I help you, friend?

28:10.187 --> 28:11.450
Broken tail light.

28:11.570 --> 28:13.895
That will cost you around here.

28:14.312 --> 28:15.646
Let me fix that.

28:15.663 --> 28:17.608
- No need to get out, sir.
- It's okay.

28:17.728 --> 28:19.035
I have to see it.

28:23.066 --> 28:24.942
Boy, that's news to me!

28:25.152 --> 28:26.556
Nothing gets past me.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.153
Really?

28:28.773 --> 28:30.488
Looking for a couple of brothers.

28:30.892 --> 28:32.741
One robbed a bank in Acuña.

28:33.216 --> 28:34.793
- Seen him?
- No.

28:34.911 --> 28:36.116
But I've been looking.

28:37.080 --> 28:38.296
Good.

28:43.754 --> 28:44.919
¡Pendejo!

30:11.945 --> 30:14.080
Well I'm not gonna be needing this anymore.

30:14.989 --> 30:16.377
I don't want to know.

30:16.587 --> 30:18.453
What I do want, Professor...

30:19.594 --> 30:21.461
is your expertise.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.565
Holy mother of Gandhi.

30:25.227 --> 30:30.519
Nobody has seen these
markings for centuries!

30:30.541 --> 30:33.889
I mean, I've theorized about them.

30:33.975 --> 30:35.510
- You know what they mean?
- Yes.

30:35.688 --> 30:38.614
But, uh... no, not at all.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.222
Shit. But...

30:42.262 --> 30:43.920
it's a mix.

30:44.040 --> 30:45.451
What does it mean?

30:55.830 --> 30:58.143
I get what these mean.

30:58.468 --> 31:00.799
And I get what that means.

31:00.885 --> 31:02.546
And I get this one.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.024
One of these kids is doing his own thing.

31:05.053 --> 31:07.372
And it's sticking out, you
know, kinda like a turtle head.

31:07.377 --> 31:09.174
What does it mean?

31:09.260 --> 31:11.343
Well if I had a gun to my head,

31:11.762 --> 31:13.512
I'd say it's a map.

31:13.584 --> 31:14.818
We know that,

31:15.022 --> 31:16.749
but where does it lead?

31:18.267 --> 31:19.553
The answer

31:19.558 --> 31:21.129
is in a manuscript.

31:21.468 --> 31:23.022
A codex.

31:23.107 --> 31:25.157
The Savini Codex.

31:25.584 --> 31:29.151
It was the last surviving
document written by a Spanish friar

31:29.163 --> 31:31.447
during the time of La Conquista.

31:31.943 --> 31:33.532
According to the story,

31:33.617 --> 31:36.241
after he wrote his final words,

31:36.451 --> 31:38.337
the friar cried out,

31:38.502 --> 31:41.871
"Tantum in enigmate tunc possumus

31:42.070 --> 31:44.510
videre per umbras daemonum!"

31:46.605 --> 31:50.775
Only in dark times can we
see the demons in the shadows.

31:51.952 --> 31:53.792
And then he cut off his own head.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.471
That's impressive.

31:56.607 --> 31:57.704
Jesus.

32:00.271 --> 32:01.896
Psycho bastard.

32:13.074 --> 32:14.540
Give me something.

32:18.629 --> 32:20.944
So, where is this codex?

32:21.064 --> 32:23.623
Someplace safe.

32:31.342 --> 32:34.384
Let me tell you something about
this family you've joined, Professor.

32:34.428 --> 32:35.632
We have rules.

32:35.842 --> 32:37.930
You earn, you move up.

32:38.065 --> 32:39.076
Yeah,

32:40.368 --> 32:41.933
I know all about you.

32:42.053 --> 32:45.758
Then you know that those who prove
their value, who use their gifts

32:45.824 --> 32:48.489
for the benefit of the
family, they get rewarded.

32:49.457 --> 32:51.269
- Yeah.
- Then go,

32:51.802 --> 32:53.996
get me this codex.

33:02.342 --> 33:04.026
Got it.

33:04.792 --> 33:05.958
Professor.

33:07.474 --> 33:09.261
The sun is in the sky.

33:09.346 --> 33:10.487
Ahh.

33:11.715 --> 33:13.473
Important safety tip.

33:20.419 --> 33:21.890
This isn't so bad.

33:22.330 --> 33:25.746
Those idiots. All you need's an umbrella.

33:27.377 --> 33:29.663
Ok. What to drive, what to drive.

33:30.121 --> 33:32.069
Ah, my chariot awaits.

33:32.189 --> 33:34.945
Oh, shit! Aah!

33:42.913 --> 33:44.713
What if she doesn't let me back there?

33:44.832 --> 33:46.498
She will, okay?

33:47.099 --> 33:48.724
You've got to relax.

33:49.467 --> 33:50.941
It's a good score, Kate.

33:51.339 --> 33:53.005
You did the work.

33:53.324 --> 33:56.352
And I know I didn't exactly
make this easy on you, so...

33:56.982 --> 33:58.338
thank you for

33:59.220 --> 34:00.877
putting up with my shit.

34:11.002 --> 34:12.822
_

34:12.943 --> 34:13.909
Okay.

34:14.944 --> 34:16.527
You ready, partner?

34:38.887 --> 34:40.130
_

34:43.914 --> 34:45.975
_

34:46.905 --> 34:49.527
_

34:49.647 --> 34:51.214
Your Spanish is good.

34:51.333 --> 34:53.315
I was thinking maybe braids?

34:53.400 --> 34:54.523
Okay, sit.

34:54.561 --> 34:56.202
Well, uh, first, could I

34:56.697 --> 34:58.919
- use the restroom?
- No, mija, it's broken.

34:58.984 --> 35:00.377
Oh, that's ok, I just need to

35:00.393 --> 35:02.720
wash my hands 'cause I ate churros.

35:03.077 --> 35:04.391
Sticky.

35:04.712 --> 35:05.945
Okay.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.163
Thank you. Gracias.

35:10.116 --> 35:11.833
Parker?

35:12.036 --> 35:14.128
No better name for a gentleman thief.

35:14.419 --> 35:17.362
Tuscaloosa, Alabama? What,
did you throw darts at a map?

35:17.482 --> 35:19.713
Seth Gecko never robbed
any banks in Alabama.

35:19.833 --> 35:21.886
That anybody knows of. Ok?

35:24.356 --> 35:25.507
Listen.

35:26.104 --> 35:27.266
I, um...

35:27.541 --> 35:29.539
I didn't like how we left things, you know?

35:29.853 --> 35:31.103
Then don't leave.

35:36.277 --> 35:38.026
It's all in the reflexes.

35:44.919 --> 35:46.166
Here we go.

35:53.127 --> 35:54.459
Oh, my God.

36:14.928 --> 36:16.198
Oh, okay.

36:19.506 --> 36:20.787
Uh...

36:21.288 --> 36:22.237
Really?

36:22.357 --> 36:25.360
_

36:26.160 --> 36:28.043
No, no, no, no, no.

36:45.298 --> 36:48.008
_

36:58.039 --> 36:58.988
Okay.

37:01.326 --> 37:02.542
There we go.

37:02.661 --> 37:03.710
There.

37:07.107 --> 37:08.915
Okay, sleep tight.

37:09.000 --> 37:09.966
Yeah.

37:14.402 --> 37:17.877
Oh yeah, that's gotta be the
dumbest thing you've ever done, Seth.

37:18.476 --> 37:19.892
Total waste.

37:39.231 --> 37:40.264
Thank you.

37:40.328 --> 37:41.090
_

37:41.410 --> 37:42.372
_

37:42.437 --> 37:43.870
_

37:46.310 --> 37:47.871
_

37:55.725 --> 37:58.732
So, do you think we should do maybe one...

38:00.362 --> 38:03.020
_

38:03.241 --> 38:04.989
_

38:06.340 --> 38:08.686
_

38:08.806 --> 38:10.735
_

38:52.252 --> 38:53.468
_

38:53.705 --> 38:55.276
_

38:55.570 --> 38:56.888
_

38:56.953 --> 38:59.153
_

38:59.444 --> 39:01.902
- You know I can hear you.
- Sí.

39:02.163 --> 39:04.015
We know.

39:04.017 --> 39:06.583
No time for braid talks. We got
a bus to catch. Come on, let's go.

39:07.118 --> 39:08.451
Sorry.

39:14.045 --> 39:16.342
Don't do that. Not a good idea.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.734
Let me tell you something, ok?

39:21.850 --> 39:23.419
And I know that you habla ingles,

39:23.435 --> 39:26.335
so don't even give me that
little look, all right?

39:26.384 --> 39:29.526
I am not your enemy.
And I am not your friend.

39:29.596 --> 39:32.158
I am simply here for what is mine.

39:32.444 --> 39:34.541
Now I understand that it was yours,

39:34.617 --> 39:37.912
but due to the unwritten
rules of this life you chose,

39:38.076 --> 39:39.680
it now belongs to me.

39:40.250 --> 39:42.118
So I'm going to take it.

39:42.123 --> 39:45.291
And there's not a thing that you or
Menudo here are gonna do about it.

39:45.457 --> 39:47.040
This is who I am.

39:47.125 --> 39:48.864
This is what I do.

39:49.332 --> 39:51.339
Thank you for your cooperation.

39:51.796 --> 39:52.795
Adios.

40:03.858 --> 40:05.058
We made it.

40:20.909 --> 40:22.208
Come on, come on!

40:28.967 --> 40:31.314
Get down!

40:32.337 --> 40:34.053
Aah!

40:37.142 --> 40:39.933
Long way from Kansas City, Mr. Gecko.

40:40.053 --> 40:41.142
Fuck yourself.

40:41.213 --> 40:43.488
I want your brother. And the whore!

40:43.908 --> 40:46.017
And you're gonna help me find him!

40:47.769 --> 40:50.278
This one, I don't need.

41:08.707 --> 41:09.872
No!

41:09.958 --> 41:11.708
Go!

41:11.793 --> 41:12.875
Get in the car!

41:13.962 --> 41:15.712
No! Rafa!

41:37.072 --> 41:38.368
I know you're there.

41:40.905 --> 41:43.489
Your savior is a madman.

41:47.175 --> 41:49.370
I just want the same thing as Sex Machine.

41:49.795 --> 41:51.047
Earn my way up.

41:51.941 --> 41:53.082
Then climb.

41:55.387 --> 41:56.302
How?

41:58.420 --> 42:00.357
By doing something memorable.

42:00.892 --> 42:04.093
Something for which I
will be eternally grateful.

42:07.899 --> 42:09.567
Kill Carlos.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.444
He came out of nowhere.

42:21.795 --> 42:24.238
I had no way of knowing

42:24.259 --> 42:26.395
- that he was going...
- I knew. I knew it.

42:26.777 --> 42:28.983
I knew this was gonna happen.

42:29.982 --> 42:31.500
How could you possibly know?

42:31.516 --> 42:32.909
Because I'm a professional crook.

42:32.936 --> 42:35.548
And I've lived long enough
to know when a thing is shit.

42:36.514 --> 42:39.312
I smelled it all over your
little street rat, too.

42:39.893 --> 42:41.394
Rafa was my friend.

42:41.404 --> 42:44.717
- And he tried to help us.
- No. He was... he was one of 'em, and you knew it.

42:45.251 --> 42:47.451
Yes, I did know, and I trusted him.

42:47.489 --> 42:49.554
- He was gonna help me with my brother...
- You want help?

42:49.674 --> 42:50.813
Let me help you.

42:51.643 --> 42:54.143
And listen real close,
because this one's gold.

42:54.671 --> 42:57.807
Everybody that you ever loved is dead.

42:59.317 --> 43:00.965
Including your brother.

43:07.781 --> 43:11.354
- Stop the car.
- What "stop the car"? What are you talking about?

43:11.427 --> 43:13.000
- Stop the car.
- What?

43:13.070 --> 43:15.381
Stop the goddamn car!

43:24.598 --> 43:25.631
You want out?

43:26.003 --> 43:26.891
Get out.

43:27.011 --> 43:28.726
You want to go play in the darkness,

43:28.780 --> 43:30.995
Little Miss Sunshine? You be my guest.

43:30.996 --> 43:32.341
I don't need this shit.

43:34.574 --> 43:36.686
- I'm not ready.
- Oh, no, sure you are.

43:36.702 --> 43:39.377
You pulled your first big job
all by yourself, isn't that right?

43:39.544 --> 43:41.858
In fact, here you go.

43:41.993 --> 43:43.576
Here's your diploma.

43:43.860 --> 43:46.598
Take half, get the hell out.

43:50.869 --> 43:52.034
Thanks.

44:02.847 --> 44:04.180
Shit.

44:22.116 --> 44:23.866
Just take it.

44:35.708 --> 44:37.129
In the labyrinth,

44:37.248 --> 44:39.425
I dreamt of the ocean.

44:40.146 --> 44:41.841
The sound of the ships.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.504
The echoing wood.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.667
Straining, wanting to break.

44:48.001 --> 44:49.592
We traveled so far...

44:51.197 --> 44:53.301
to find the New World.

44:55.350 --> 44:57.158
You went on your own journey,

44:57.402 --> 44:59.685
across an ocean of sand...

45:05.809 --> 45:09.312
with your substitute
father and your sister.

45:10.818 --> 45:13.433
They didn't know what you were capable of,

45:13.675 --> 45:15.451
what you could become.

45:20.875 --> 45:23.292
And this is how you come to kill me?

45:24.893 --> 45:26.210
Like a coward?

45:29.221 --> 45:31.601
You can't even look me in the eye.

45:36.029 --> 45:37.013
Go.

45:38.111 --> 45:40.290
Go find a new ocean to cross.

45:40.581 --> 45:42.276
Now, it might bend you

45:42.668 --> 45:44.304
and it may break you...

45:45.283 --> 45:47.053
but you will learn

45:47.279 --> 45:49.258
what you need to know.

46:00.345 --> 46:02.223
Oh, shit!
