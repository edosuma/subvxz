33:24.491 --> 33:29.028
troll doll.
Still, still, he is rich enough

33:29.029 --> 33:31.192
to hire our first lady to write
a speech for his third lady.

33:31.193 --> 33:39.193
To hire our first lady to write
a speech for his third lady.

33:40.173 --> 33:45.511
But what do I know?
What do I know?

33:45.512 --> 33:51.417
I can't even vote.
Now if 'tweens could vote, then

33:51.418 --> 33:55.154
Harry Potter would be president
as long as he raised the legal

33:55.155 --> 33:59.758
age of the kids menu to include
'tweens.

33:59.759 --> 34:01.192
'Cause, in fact, why stop there?
'Cause who doesn't like a happy

34:01.193 --> 34:04.496
'cause, in fact, why stop there?
'Cause who doesn't like a happy

34:04.497 --> 34:08.534
face parrot cake and some
crayons?

34:08.535 --> 34:11.203
Yeah.
Also, if 'tweens could vote,

34:11.204 --> 34:16.809
then braces would be illegal.
In most cases they don't

34:16.810 --> 34:20.045
elongate your life, they're
false advertising, basically,

34:20.046 --> 34:27.553
they're a boob job for your
teeth and I'm not ready to live

34:27.554 --> 34:31.156
that lie.
Yes, Johnny, I would love to Bo

34:31.157 --> 34:31.193
to the homecoming dance with...
are you staring at my teeth?

34:31.194 --> 34:39.194
To the homecoming dance with...
are you staring at my teeth?

34:40.934 --> 34:48.007
My eyes are up here.
Sicko.

34:48.008 --> 34:52.344
Look, I love this country and
believe America's smart and I

34:52.345 --> 35:00.345
know whoever the voters pick to
be our next president, well,

35:00.954 --> 35:01.193
she'll do great.
It's all in the e-mails.

35:01.194 --> 35:09.194
She'll do great.
It's all in the e-mails.

35:12.499 --> 35:15.467
Thank you, everybody!
God bless America!

35:15.468 --> 35:21.173
No, no, no, hold on, hold on,
hold on, thank god bless

35:21.174 --> 35:27.313
America, no, really, somebody,
help us, please.

35:27.314 --> 35:31.192
Help!
Aah!

35:31.193 --> 35:31.985
Help!
Aah!

35:31.986 --> 35:39.058
That's right.
Lori mae with the jokes.

35:39.059 --> 35:42.428
Out here, Howie, are you
laughing, talk to us.

35:42.429 --> 35:44.830
You are adorable.
Are you amazing.

35:44.831 --> 35:48.434
I will say to America, for you
more than anybody, we got to get

35:48.435 --> 35:52.271
the votes out, because I don't
think one republican is going to

35:52.272 --> 35:54.473
vote for you.
But you're wonderful and you

35:54.474 --> 36:01.192
deserve it, but you just killed
half the country for yourself.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.247
Deserve it, but you just killed
half the country for yourself.

36:02.248 --> 36:04.683
- Mel b.
- I think you are

36:04.684 --> 36:06.118
adorable.
Absolutely adorable.

36:06.119 --> 36:09.688
You are very, very funny.
You have taken current affairs

36:09.689 --> 36:13.859
and put humor on it.
So I think, well done, well

36:13.860 --> 36:14.960
- done.
- Simon cowell.

36:14.961 --> 36:18.697
You have a look on your face
like you want to say something,

36:18.698 --> 36:21.633
brother you know, Lori, when

36:21.634 --> 36:24.503
you came out, I'm just so shy.
You're not.

36:24.504 --> 36:28.073
You're very naughty.
You know what I like about you,

36:28.074 --> 36:31.192
you are edgy, cool and country.
And that's why people are going

36:31.193 --> 36:34.380
you are edgy, cool and country.
And that's why people are going

36:34.381 --> 36:37.249
to pick up to vote for you.♪♪♪♪

36:37.250 --> 36:39.351
Good luck, Lori mae.
You said a lot.

36:39.352 --> 36:41.887
Is there something else you
wanted to say?

36:41.888 --> 36:49.461
Well, Mr. Cannon, I think
Bernie Sanders said it best, we

36:49.462 --> 36:57.462
did a good fight, but now we
must vote for Lori mae

36:57.737 --> 37:00.172
- Hernandez!
- Voting is opened now.

37:00.173 --> 37:01.192
You can vote up to ten times for
each act with each voting met

37:01.193 --> 37:05.844
you can vote up to ten times for
each act with each voting met

37:05.845 --> 37:07.813
odd.
So get to it, America!

37:07.814 --> 37:10.916
Coming up after the break, a
pro-football player turned

37:10.917 --> 37:14.119
amazing magician and one of the
most dangerous acts we've ever

37:14.120 --> 37:17.424
seen.
Stay right there.

37:34.167 --> 37:37.235
Oh, yeah, welcome back
to "America's got talent."

37:37.236 --> 37:42.140
We are live in Hollywood having
a great time.

37:42.141 --> 37:44.376
Okay.
Listen up, please do not try

37:44.377 --> 37:47.546
what you are about to see at
home.

37:47.547 --> 37:50.649
Here's a husband and wife with
one of the most dangerous acts

37:50.650 --> 37:56.009
we've ever had.
It's deadly games.

37:56.010 --> 38:02.694
We've ever had.
It's deadly games.

38:02.695 --> 38:07.999
We got married in Europe and
got married in December of 2013.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.304
Are you a daddy.
>> We have a beautiful daughter.

38:12.305 --> 38:15.140
She's the reason we do what we
do.

38:15.141 --> 38:17.075
We travel every week.
It's very difficult.

38:17.076 --> 38:19.711
We really want to all show
the service.

38:19.712 --> 38:23.081
Our family will have a better
life for sure.

38:23.082 --> 38:26.009
We are not that different from
any other family or any other

38:26.010 --> 38:26.352
we are not that different from
any other family or any other

38:26.353 --> 38:34.353
couple until we start to train.
What we do is very dangerous.

38:34.727 --> 38:40.732
We rehearse for our second
edition t. Spins board

38:40.733 --> 38:46.438
collapsed.
So she really put her life in

38:46.439 --> 38:49.841
risk every time.
>> On stage please.

38:49.842 --> 38:52.811
This time, we train blindfolded.

38:52.812 --> 38:56.009
We train for a much further
distance, very dangerous.

38:56.010 --> 38:57.349
We train for a much further
distance, very dangerous.

38:57.350 --> 39:05.350
I'm scared right now, I know if
I miss by this much, I can kill

Heidi Klum, you were standing on

42:06.739 --> 42:09.007
Talk to them
I mean, it's so scary.

42:09.008 --> 42:13.144
I have to say, I love you guys,
Alfredo, I think you are

42:13.145 --> 42:15.547
fantastic.
Are you a showman, let's be

42:15.548 --> 42:21.519
honest the real story here is
your beautiful wife.

42:21.520 --> 42:24.456
That is true you are gorgeous

42:24.457 --> 42:26.009
this is total madness,
it is the scariest thing I have

42:26.010 --> 42:27.659
this is total madness,
it is the scariest thing I have

42:27.660 --> 42:32.964
ever seen.
I have to tell you, you are

42:32.965 --> 42:34.799
brilliant.
Your presentation is incredible.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.168
That is what we talk about
getting better in the show.

42:37.169 --> 42:40.405
Not just doing the best thing.
This is becoming or maybe

42:40.406 --> 42:44.075
already is a world class act.
Congratulations.

42:44.076 --> 42:45.977
Mr. mandel.

42:45.978 --> 42:49.714
You know what, this
plays on two levels, not only is

42:49.715 --> 42:52.350
it dangerous, not only is it
thrilling.

42:52.351 --> 42:54.986
Not only is she beautiful, but
you teach us a lesson.

42:54.987 --> 42:56.009
As a married man, I think what I
take away from the act, it's so

42:56.010 --> 42:58.156
as a married man, I think what I
take away from the act, it's so

42:58.157 --> 43:04.529
important to listen to your
wife.

43:04.530 --> 43:05.930
So we've all learned

43:05.931 --> 43:09.868
something and listen to us when
we tell you, you got to vote you

43:09.869 --> 43:15.540
should say it, ma'am, tell them
to vote.

43:15.541 --> 43:18.376
Please soet no, her, her.

43:18.377 --> 43:23.214
- >> Yes, please soet.
- Mel b.

43:23.215 --> 43:25.884
I was sitting here
screaming, screaming.

43:25.885 --> 43:26.010
The presentation is on point I
didn't understand why you

43:26.011 --> 43:30.655
the presentation is on point I
didn't understand why you

43:30.656 --> 43:33.591
- ducked?
- He would have killed

43:33.592 --> 43:35.760
- her.
- What's wrong with you?

43:35.761 --> 43:41.132
That was the finale, it
came right at her.

43:41.133 --> 43:45.203
If she didn't did you, you
wouldn't be talking to her.

43:45.204 --> 43:49.240
Great job, deadly
games, good luck tonight.

43:49.241 --> 43:54.512
You know the score, can you vote
online or by phone.

43:54.513 --> 43:56.009
However you do it, you got to
vote.

43:56.010 --> 43:57.348
However you do it, you got to
vote.

43:57.349 --> 43:58.550
We'll be right back right after
the break.

43:58.551 --> 44:00.511
Now, let's take a look at what
these guys did.♪♪♪♪

44:13.416 --> 44:15.966
Welcome back to
"America's got talent."

44:15.967 --> 44:20.702
We are live!
Now, this next act made it to

44:20.703 --> 44:26.551
Hollywood because of ne-yo's
buzzer.

44:26.552 --> 44:32.966
He is a sensational magician.
He is jon dorenbos.

44:32.967 --> 44:35.969
I have been fortunate to have
a wonderful career in the NFL.

44:35.970 --> 44:37.210
And now this is a chance to take
my other passion and bring it to

44:37.211 --> 44:39.673
and now this is a chance to take
my other passion and bring it to

44:39.674 --> 44:42.442
the world.
You know, magic helped me

44:42.443 --> 44:44.344
through the darkest time of my
life.

44:44.345 --> 44:48.982
I just found out at 12-years-old
that my father murdered my

44:48.983 --> 44:51.484
mother.
>> When John lost his mom, he

44:51.485 --> 44:55.322
lost the world.
He took his sweatshirt and he

44:55.323 --> 45:02.562
was just rubbing it and he says,
I don't have a mom anymore.

45:02.563 --> 45:07.210
I'm sorry that our daughter will
never see what he has

45:07.211 --> 45:08.501
I'm sorry that our daughter will
never see what he has

45:08.502 --> 45:10.770
accomplished.
>> I would oftentimes just go

45:10.771 --> 45:15.008
into a really sad place and I
knew I needed to get out of it.

45:15.009 --> 45:17.644
I would take card out and
shuffle.

45:17.645 --> 45:20.580
Oh my gosh, magic was the cure.

45:20.581 --> 45:24.484
So we used to do tricks
together.

45:24.485 --> 45:28.355
My grandpa wasn't a magician
by trade, but he taught me

45:28.356 --> 45:30.924
something can be so difficult,
if I just work on it and

45:30.925 --> 45:35.562
practice it, I'll figure it out.
Magic, it's guided me and to me,

45:35.563 --> 45:37.210
that's my mom, saying, I'm right
hire, I'm in the front row and I

45:37.211 --> 45:39.566
that's my mom, saying, I'm right
hire, I'm in the front row and I

45:39.567 --> 45:42.969
love you and she is the light
that shines on me, every day of

45:42.970 --> 45:50.577
my life, I know my mom's there.

45:50.578 --> 45:53.079
We have a prediction in a
bottle.

45:53.080 --> 45:55.949
I wrote something down.
We will sit it by you, Simon.

45:55.950 --> 45:58.218
The last time I was here, I did
the drawing.

45:58.219 --> 46:02.355
I will mix this up, I will put
postercard in front of you.

46:02.356 --> 46:05.992
You have markers.
Make sure nobody can see this,

46:05.993 --> 46:07.210
draw something, keep it to
yourself, draw it close to you,

46:07.211 --> 46:09.195
draw something, keep it to
yourself, draw it close to you,

46:09.196 --> 46:13.466
keep it close to you, put it up
against your chest so I can't

46:13.467 --> 46:16.102
sigh it, dude, it's a
personality chest.

46:16.103 --> 46:21.074
Can you see a lot about people,
their hopes, dreams, dudes draw

46:21.075 --> 46:23.910
action, viking ships.
Chicks draw flowers and birds

46:23.911 --> 46:31.911
and sunshines, nobody can see
this, are they all face down on

46:34.955 --> 46:35.756
- the table?
- Yes.

46:35.757 --> 46:37.210
Mel b., shuf him them out, so
you don't get the order, I don't

46:37.211 --> 46:39.025
Mel b., shuf him them out, so
you don't get the order, I don't

46:39.026 --> 46:42.829
know the order, we will get in
the head of these guy, men and

46:42.830 --> 46:46.299
women, face down, don't look.
Oh, perfect.

46:46.300 --> 46:50.203
Awe, this is beautiful, now, as
you guys can see this is kind of

46:50.204 --> 46:53.807
a smaller heart person, I like
the big hearts, this is a tiny

46:53.808 --> 46:55.975
heart.
I see success in this one.

46:55.976 --> 46:59.479
If we actually go with this,
Heidi, I think you have a big

46:59.480 --> 47:03.383
heart, Mel b. I think you too
do, for some reason, this heart

47:03.384 --> 47:07.210
is drawing me to you.
Did you draw this?

47:07.211 --> 47:09.589
Is drawing me to you.
Did you draw this?

47:09.590 --> 47:11.357
Yes.
>> We are one for one.

47:11.358 --> 47:15.662
Yes, this is perfect, I love it.
You know what this remind me of,

47:15.663 --> 47:23.503
big guy in a little coit coat,
Simon I love it, I'm guessing

47:23.504 --> 47:26.906
this is something you'd wear,
I'm guessing

47:26.907 --> 47:31.077
it is my sweater.
>> That's why I came over to

47:31.078 --> 47:34.180
you, two for two, give me one,
this is great.

47:34.181 --> 47:37.210
Believe it or not, people will
do self portraits on how they

47:37.211 --> 47:37.685
believe it or not, people will
do self portraits on how they

47:37.686 --> 47:40.887
view themselves.
Simon, I love you, man, I don't

47:40.888 --> 47:44.057
think this is yours.
So Heidi, I'm just going to

47:44.058 --> 47:49.095
guess are you the butterfly of
the group

47:49.096 --> 47:50.697
yes.
>> We have one left, it's

47:50.698 --> 47:53.733
obviously Simon, I'm trying to
guess what this is.

47:53.734 --> 47:57.637
Heidi, I will take your
butterfly, Simon, I will draw a

47:57.638 --> 48:00.673
sketch, all I want you to do is
think about what you drew, don't

48:00.674 --> 48:04.444
lie to me, don't be that guy
I won't.

48:04.445 --> 48:07.210
I got to think about your
drawing, Simon, a simple yes or

48:07.211 --> 48:08.681
I got to think about your
drawing, Simon, a simple yes or

48:08.682 --> 48:12.152
no will do.
My drawing will match yours.

48:12.153 --> 48:20.153
Did you draw a pickle on a
treadmill?

48:24.899 --> 48:25.999
Adam

48:26.000 --> 48:27.033
no.
>> Did you draw no?

48:27.034 --> 48:29.469
Let's check this out.
This is totally, I don't know if

this show.
Because of you.

1:23:08.295 --> 1:23:12.164
The fact that your arms are
flameing around, it was a bit

1:23:12.165 --> 1:23:15.234
awkward.

kill us with that vocal.
