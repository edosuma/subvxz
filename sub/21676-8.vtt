any chicken downstairs.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999

and thought it was delicious,

27:07.999 --> 27:08.999

are weirded out

27:08.999 --> 27:10.999

scallops people.

27:10.999 --> 27:11.999
- f***ing quesadillas.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999

simplistic thing you can get.

such a bad deck crew after all.

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999

we just had our anniversary,

and I was hoping maybe there was
something you guys could do--

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
maybe some flowers...
- Of course.

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
- And, like, a couple's massage
or something.

28:15.999 --> 28:17.999
- I can definitely arrange that.
- Yeah?

28:17.999 --> 28:20.999
- Okay. So let me see what time
I can get somebody to the boat,

28:20.999 --> 28:22.999

with you tomorrow.

28:22.999 --> 28:23.999

- Yeah.

- Thank you.

Thank you.
