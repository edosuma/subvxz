(woman) I remember when I first read
this book, I fell in love with the story,

00:06.872 --> 00:10.000
It was one of the most beautiful,
poignant love stories

00:12.833 --> 00:12.911
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:12.911 --> 00:15.209

You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:15.209 --> 00:15.914
You're Watching on 123Movies.to

00:15.914 --> 00:20.783

00:22.000 --> 00:26.984
and not subjected to the definition or
identity others have carved out for her,

00:27.058 --> 00:30.357
The first time Janie and Tea Cake kiss

00:30.428 --> 00:35.559
reinvents the whole idea
and notion of kissing,

00:35.634 --> 00:39.502
I would have to say
that if you can get a kiss like that,

00:39.571 --> 00:42.096
you can die a happy woman,

00:42.174 --> 00:48.841
When this movie airs, Zora Neale Hurston, wherever she is, is gonna give a shout

01:04.029 --> 01:08.363
(woman) There's two things
everybody got to find out for theyselves,

01:08.433 --> 01:11.300
They got to find out about love,

01:11.369 --> 01:14.634
and they got to find out about livin',

01:29.921 --> 01:33.357
(woman) Now, love is like the sea,

01:33.425 --> 01:38.362
It's a movin ' thing,
And it's different on every shore,

01:39.364 --> 01:41.764
And livin',,,

01:41.833 --> 01:43.994
Well,

01:44.069 --> 01:47.061
I just come back from buryin' the dead,

02:10.527 --> 02:12.519
(man) Is that Miss Starks?

02:12.597 --> 02:16.033
Sure enough Iooks Iike

02:16.101 --> 02:19.070
Yes, 'cept Miss Starks
wouldn't be wearin' no coveralls,

02:19.137 --> 02:21.401
That Tea Cake,

02:21.473 --> 02:25.000
That's what happens when you run off
with a yellow fellow Iike Tea Cake,

02:25.076 --> 02:28.068
Oh, you just mad
'cause she ain't run off with you!

02:28.146 --> 02:29.773
(men laugh)

02:29.848 --> 02:33.306
Ain't no way in the world
that's Mrs, Mayor Starks,

02:33.385 --> 02:35.376
No way in the world,

02:35.453 --> 02:39.913
Janie?
Lord, we been worried sick about you!

02:40.925 --> 02:43.257
Go to hell,

02:44.029 --> 02:47.192

Crawlin' back, Didn't I?

03:55.667 --> 03:57.999
(plays slow tune)

04:13.785 --> 04:16.447

04:31.703 --> 04:36.072
(woman #2) What's she doin' with Iong

04:36.141 --> 04:38.701
(woman) Where's Tea Cake,
that's what I want to know,

04:38.777 --> 04:40.768
Weren't she a widow woman, almost 40?

04:40.845 --> 04:43.143
That young boy

05:36.468 --> 05:39.301
That's a gracious plenty,

05:39.370 --> 05:42.965
Your friends wouldn't want nothing better,

05:45.376 --> 05:49.437

- Thank you,
- Janie,

05:54.752 --> 05:57.084
Here you go,

06:02.393 --> 06:08.332
If that Tea Cake ever shows his behind in
Eatonville again, he gonna wish he hadn't,

06:09.434 --> 06:15.031
He knew that you had just Iost Joe, so he
took advantage of you, and your money,

06:15.106 --> 06:17.131
He ain't wasted none of my money,

06:17.208 --> 06:19.870
And if he was here,

06:19.944 --> 06:22.538
But he gone,

06:22.614 --> 06:24.946
Ain'the?

06:26.351 --> 06:28.615
He dragged you down to his Ievel,
and then,,,

06:28.686 --> 06:33.851
- Y'all think he did me wrong,
- Janie, we all know he did you wrong,

06:36.694 --> 06:39.561
Well, I ain't stunned what they think,

06:45.503 --> 06:48.961
You don't care what I think neither, do you?

06:50.508 --> 06:54.342
You Ieft this town,

06:54.412 --> 06:56.403
Me and Tea Cake had us a real Iove,

06:56.481 --> 06:59.814
You got the nerve to come back up in here
with no shoes on your feet,

06:59.884 --> 07:01.977
and nothing but overalls on your back,

07:02.053 --> 07:04.578
making everything we believed in
Iook Iike dirt,

07:04.656 --> 07:07.352
- Me and Tea Cake had a real Iove,
- How could you do that?

07:07.425 --> 07:11.452

- I used to Iook up to you,

07:17.468 --> 07:19.459

07:21.406 --> 07:26.571
The only way you,
and this whole town, ever seen me

07:26.644 --> 07:29.613
was as Mrs, Mayor Starks,

07:31.950 --> 07:34.544
Sittin' out there on that porch,

07:35.920 --> 07:38.821
Silk dresses on,

07:38.890 --> 07:41.791
All high an' mighty.

07:43.227 --> 07:45.718
Just as Iadylike as you please,

07:49.601 --> 07:52.968
That might have been the Janie y'all knew,

07:55.807 --> 07:58.970
But that wasn't the Janie I ever was,

08:02.747 --> 08:07.548
(Janie) You see,
I ain't never known my poppa, or my ma,

08:07.619 --> 08:09.951
My grandmomma raised me,

08:20.865 --> 08:23.663
I was born sorta knowing things,

08:24.936 --> 08:28.337
Like how the trees and the wind talk,

08:29.607 --> 08:36.445
I told the seeds when they was fallin ',
"I sure hope y'all fall on soft ground, "

08:42.352 --> 08:46.915
That year,
something about me was different,

08:47.925 --> 08:53.522
It's like my life was starting
right at that moment,

08:59.437 --> 09:01.632
Hey, Johnny T aylor,

09:01.706 --> 09:04.971
- How you doin', Janie?

You was just Iettin' that trashy boy, that

09:58.029 --> 10:02.557
- He wasn't wipin' his feet on me,
- The woman is the mule of the world,

10:02.633 --> 10:04.863
I didn't mean no harm, Nanny,

10:04.936 --> 10:09.566
You don't even know what harm is, girl,

10:13.845 --> 10:16.746
Yeah, You gonna get married right away,

10:23.454 --> 10:26.855
- To Johnny Taylor?
- No, child,

10:26.924 --> 10:32.123
I'd wanted you to school out,
but that ain't your idea, I see,

10:32.196 --> 10:33.720
Why,,,

10:33.798 --> 10:36.130
Why, I ain't ready to get married,

10:36.200 --> 10:39.363
Oh, So you don't want to marry off decent,

10:39.437 --> 10:44.465
You want to be Iike your momma was,
You want to run wild, break my heart,

10:45.476 --> 10:50.573
Someone good and decent's
been asking after you for a while now,

10:55.486 --> 10:57.750
Brother Logan Killicks,

10:59.357 --> 11:01.689
Logan Killicks?

11:05.563 --> 11:09.090
That's what he been

11:11.736 --> 11:16.799
He Iook Iike
some old skull head in a graveyard,

11:18.576 --> 11:22.808
Brother Killicks got 60 acres,
And he's good and decent,

11:22.880 --> 11:25.178
I don't care what he got,

11:28.686 --> 11:34.682
(Janie) Nanny took the horizon
and pinched it into a little bit of a thing,

12:23.741 --> 12:29.111
(Nanny) Janie?
Janie, what in the world are you doing?

12:29.180 --> 12:31.580

just like Nanny wanted,

13:17.161 --> 13:20.995
It was true, Logan was good and decent,

13:23.301 --> 13:26.998
I was a proper married woman,

13:27.071 --> 13:30.131
But I was still waiting for love to begin,

13:30.207 --> 13:32.767

19:00.337 --> 19:03.500
You don't appreciate my good treatment,

I got 60 acres,

19:21.425 --> 19:24.917
And I ain't no young man,

20:29.226 --> 20:33.094
And even if he wasn't there waiting for me,

20:33.163 --> 20:37.259
the change was bound to do me good,

20:41.805 --> 20:44.035
Hey, girl!

We'd be happy to put you up,
Willy, tie up his horse,

22:30.481 --> 22:32.813
- (man) Yeah,

22:33.917 --> 22:37.250
I'm gonna get me a wife just Iike that,

22:37.321 --> 22:39.846
You ain't got
but a fish sandwich to your name,

22:39.923 --> 22:43.984
You can't get the Iikes of her
with no fish sandwich,

22:54.505 --> 22:57.030
(Joe) How many acres y'all got now?

22:57.107 --> 23:00.736
- 'Bout 50,
- That ain't enough for no town,

23:00.811 --> 23:04.941
Well, we was real fortunate that Captain
Eaton gave us the acres to get started,

23:05.015 --> 23:09.679
Captain Eaton own the sawmill
we work in, He's a fairer man than most,

23:09.753 --> 23:12.688
Y'all want this to be
a town of significance, don't you?

23:12.756 --> 23:15.816
Sure, but Captain Eaton
ain't gonna give us no more Iand now,

23:15.893 --> 23:19.954
Cap'n Eaton?
He's generous, but he ain't stupid,

23:21.932 --> 23:25.868
He might not give you no more,
but you can buy more,

23:32.142 --> 23:37.170
Been a town a whole year, You would think
they'd have more happening by now,

23:37.247 --> 23:40.410
They just need you to show 'em what to do,

23:41.451 --> 23:46.184
I pray to God
they ain't a bunch of Iazy no-counts,

23:47.190 --> 23:49.624
They need a Ieader, that's all,

23:49.693 --> 23:54.653
Look to me Iike Joe Starks'd
be the perfect man for the job,

23:56.533 --> 24:01.300
Look at this face, Good-Iookin' enough
to be on a silver dollar,

24:02.239 --> 24:07.905
This chest,,, strong and broad,

24:07.978 --> 24:12.438
Bet you got a big speech-making voice
in there, don't you?

24:12.516 --> 24:18.113
These hands,,, Lord knows, these hands

24:21.425 --> 24:25.691
We'II buy a hundred acres,
And then we'II buy a hundred more,

24:25.762 --> 24:28.196
I'II sell the Iand we don't need
to newcomers,

24:28.265 --> 24:30.699
and we'II put Eatonville
in the middle of the map,

24:30.767 --> 24:35.295
And with the money we make,
we'II buy you your very own train guard,

24:35.372 --> 24:39.103
and we gonna
crisscross this country first class,

24:39.176 --> 24:43.306
Call me Jody Iike you do sometimes,
Call me Jody,

24:47.417 --> 24:49.749
Jody,,,

24:52.389 --> 24:55.586
He ain't gonna buy nothing,
I'm tellin' you, He all talk,

24:55.659 --> 24:58.628
I been tellin' y'all

24:58.695 --> 25:01.664
(man) Lord, I don't know,

25:02.099 --> 25:04.567
I hope he can,,,

25:04.635 --> 25:07.001

- Joe pullin' out his money,

25:07.070 --> 25:09.834

25:09.906 --> 25:12.841
Captain Eaton's signin' the paper!

25:15.412 --> 25:17.312
- (woman) What you see?
- (man) Shh!

25:20.417 --> 25:24.513
- And Joe done signed the paper too!
- (cheering and shouting)

25:30.494 --> 25:34.692
(Janie) The next day,
we all voted Joe to be the mayor,

25:34.765 --> 25:37.928
Wasn't nobody
more proud of him than me,

25:47.411 --> 25:49.402
Hold on,

25:50.814 --> 25:55.751
(Janie) He just strolled around,
all wrapped up in his new dignity,

25:56.753 --> 25:59.984
Thinkin', plannin' our future,

26:01.391 --> 26:05.919
And I was right there with him,
ready to help,

26:30.487 --> 26:35.652
Some folks need thrones and
ruling chairs to make their influence felt,

26:35.726 --> 26:41.631
But not Joe,
He had a throne in the seat of his pants,

27:12.295 --> 27:17.323
When the new families came,
the land we bought made us a good profit,

27:17.400 --> 27:21.268
And we invested the money
back into Eatonville,

27:33.016 --> 27:35.712
- In the kitchen, Thank you,
- Which way, Mrs, Starks?

27:35.786 --> 27:38.949
- That goes upstairs,
- (notes on piano)

27:42.392 --> 27:44.860
Can't neither one of us play it,

27:44.928 --> 27:48.386
This ain't for playin',
This is just for Iookin' at,

27:48.465 --> 27:50.660
Shoot, Jody!

27:57.107 --> 28:01.544
This is the Iife
Nanny always dreamed of me havin',

28:03.480 --> 28:06.040
We did it,

28:06.116 --> 28:08.448
She'd be so happy,

28:10.987 --> 28:13.319
Are you happy?

28:14.491 --> 28:16.482
Yeah,

28:47.457 --> 28:49.448

29:10.914 --> 29:14.315

- Y'all comin'?

29:18.054 --> 29:22.047
Since I had my three children,
I just ain't got the figure I used to,

29:22.125 --> 29:25.720
You know you Iook Iike
a young gal in that dress,

29:25.795 --> 29:27.786
Sam says the mayor of Orlando's comin',

29:27.864 --> 29:30.628
And someone

29:30.700 --> 29:34.466
- Well, you know what that means, Iadies,

29:34.537 --> 29:39.372

29:39.442 --> 29:42.411
We should go, See you Iater!

29:48.184 --> 29:51.620
It's pretty,
You think Joe gonna Iike it?

29:51.688 --> 29:54.156
Course he'II Iike it,

29:56.493 --> 29:59.087
Janie?

29:59.162 --> 30:01.756
You and Joe changed everythin',

30:06.636 --> 30:10.003

30:27.324 --> 30:29.417
Lord, I done,,, I done run over the mayor!

30:29.492 --> 30:31.824
Almost, Phoebe.Almost.

30:33.063 --> 30:35.395
OK,

30:35.465 --> 30:37.797
(Joe laughs)

30:40.570 --> 30:44.904
I ordered it from
the finest Iadies' store in Orlando,

30:49.612 --> 30:51.603
Oh!

30:53.383 --> 30:55.715
Must have cost a Iot,

30:57.721 --> 31:01.157
Look at this one, This is the one
the Iadies made me, Ain't it pretty?

31:01.224 --> 31:03.556
Yeah, but it ain't befittin' of a mayor's wife,

31:03.626 --> 31:07.585
You're the bell cow,
Those other women, they're your gang,

31:07.664 --> 31:12.192
No other wife,

31:13.370 --> 31:15.702
I'm gonna show you the world,

31:17.107 --> 31:19.439
Remember?

31:26.883 --> 31:29.215
(band plays ragtime)

31:37.894 --> 31:41.386
Try as he might, Frank Taylor
can't seem to control that wife of his,

31:41.464 --> 31:45.594
Hell, if she was my wife,
I'd kill her cemetery dead,

31:52.142 --> 31:55.236
(woman) Oh, come here!
Where you goin' with them cookies?

31:55.311 --> 31:57.074
Come on, now,

31:57.147 --> 31:59.741
Oh, shoot! Gimme those cookies,

32:00.884 --> 32:03.216

32:17.367 --> 32:19.835

Too good to help us out,

32:45.462 --> 32:50.490

43:58.467 --> 44:00.867
Quit mixin' up my doings with my Iooks,
then,

44:00.936 --> 44:03.427
You outta your mind, talkin' Iike that,
I'm mayor,

44:03.506 --> 44:06.475
You the one started it,

44:06.542 --> 44:09.909
Don't be gettin' insulted about your Iooks,
You give me no children,

44:09.979 --> 44:13.710
Now you an old Iady, Nearly 40,
Ain't nobody Iookin' at you, old as you is,

44:13.783 --> 44:17.082
Well, I ain't 40, I'm only 38,
You ways past 50,

44:17.153 --> 44:20.714
Let's talk about that,
And this big fat belly you got,

44:20.790 --> 44:25.557
You talk a whole Iotta brag, Joe, But ain't
nothing big about you but your voice,

44:25.628 --> 44:28.927
Hell, pull down your britches,
Iook Iike you hit the change of Iife,

44:28.998 --> 44:31.694
- What you say to me?
- You heard her, You ain't blind,

44:31.767 --> 44:35.134
I'd rather be shot dead
than hear that about my own self,

44:35.204 --> 44:37.536
What you say to me?

45:13.142 --> 45:14.404
(Phoebe) Janie!

45:27.389 --> 45:30.586
Joe gived you everything you could want,

45:30.659 --> 45:34.322
You're not happy
because you expect too much,

45:40.469 --> 45:44.405
(Janie) Something fell off the shelf
inside me,

45:45.574 --> 45:50.637
It was Joe,
He tumbled down and shattered,

46:18.440 --> 46:20.874
(labored breathing)

46:20.943 --> 46:24.208
(Joe) Doctor say that I'm dyin',

46:26.215 --> 46:28.547
I guess you come to watch,

46:47.236 --> 46:49.227
Jody,

46:51.040 --> 46:54.635
Maybe I ain't been
such a good wife to you,

46:57.846 --> 47:04.615
But you gave me everything
a woman could ever dream of havin',

47:05.587 --> 47:07.919
And I thank you,

47:10.559 --> 47:16.464
But Jody, you and me
done been together now for 20 years,

47:17.266 --> 47:19.860
And you don't know me half at all,

47:21.070 --> 47:23.129
I know you,

47:23.205 --> 47:27.938
You changed from that Jody
I run off down the road with,

47:28.010 --> 47:31.502
I wanted to keep a house with you
in a wonderful way,

47:31.580 --> 47:34.947
but you wasn't really
satisfied with me the way I was,

47:35.017 --> 47:39.113
I built a whole town for us,

47:41.490 --> 47:45.358
- But that ain't good enough for you,
- It was just that my own feelings

47:45.427 --> 47:50.330
had to be squeezed and crowded out of me
to make room for yours in me,

47:50.399 --> 47:52.731
BIame everything on me,

47:55.871 --> 48:01.002
I don't Iet you show me no feelin', huh?
Janie, that's all I ever wanted,

48:01.076 --> 48:03.169
Ain't tryin' to blame nothing on you, Joe,

48:03.245 --> 48:07.773
But all this bowin' down and obedience,

48:07.850 --> 48:10.284
It just ain't what I run off with you for,

48:10.352 --> 48:12.411
Shut up!

48:12.488 --> 48:14.479
Shut up,

48:16.191 --> 48:21.993
Even now, you got to die
with me bein' obedient,

48:22.998 --> 48:25.592
Instead of Iettin' me Iove you,

48:27.903 --> 48:30.167
I hope,,,

48:30.239 --> 48:33.231
that thunder and Iightnin',,,

48:33.876 --> 48:36.208
kill you,

48:40.349 --> 48:43.250
Get outta here,

48:43.318 --> 48:45.684
Get Iost! (gasps)

48:45.754 --> 48:47.244
Jody?

49:00.002 --> 49:02.334
Poor Jody,,,

49:10.779 --> 49:14.715
Sittin' in that rulin' chair
was hard for you too,

49:24.126 --> 49:27.493
(Janie) Whatever folks
thought of Joe while he was livin',

49:27.563 --> 49:31.226
they turned out for his funeral,
and cried over him,

49:32.234 --> 49:37.228
'Cause whether they liked him or not,
they knew he had been a good man,

49:37.306 --> 49:40.275
and that his passin' was a great loss,

49:45.747 --> 49:48.614
I felt the sadness too,

49:48.684 --> 49:52.984
But alongside the sadness,

49:53.055 --> 49:55.785
I was feelin ' something else,

49:57.326 --> 50:00.489
I was feelin ' free,

And, and,,, and folks'II think

51:46.201 --> 51:49.227
I don't care what folks think,

And to my thinkin',

51:52.107 --> 51:56.407
mournin' shouldn't Iast
a second Ionger than the grief do,

52:05.520 --> 52:08.614
- Afternoon,
- Can I get you something?

52:09.858 --> 52:12.190
Got any smokin' tobacco?

52:23.272 --> 52:25.604
Sure do,

52:30.612 --> 52:34.070
Got a Iittle piece of fire over there, Iady?

52:35.617 --> 52:37.608
Mm-hm,

52:50.032 --> 52:53.058
So how come you ain't
over there at the ball game?

52:53.135 --> 52:55.729
Everybody else in town is there,

53:01.810 --> 53:04.142
Well, not everybody,

53:05.080 --> 53:07.378
Lady just sold me some cigarettes,

53:09.484 --> 53:12.146
I only had train fare for part of the way,

53:12.220 --> 53:15.781
so I figured
I'd catch me a ride with someone,

53:18.026 --> 53:22.690
Good Iuck,
'Cause all the cars in Eatonville has gone,

53:27.102 --> 53:29.434

54:46.248 --> 54:49.979

57:25.440 --> 57:28.898
Come on over here

01:24:32.499 --> 01:24:35.991
They came every spring,
truckloads of 'em,

01:24:36.069 --> 01:24:39.402
From the east, west, north and south,

01:24:39.472 --> 01:24:42.771
Wild people,
hopin ' to change their fortunes

01:24:42.842 --> 01:24:45.811
with the pickin ' season on the muck,

01:24:45.879 --> 01:24:49.474
Drums, Livin ' three lifetimes in one,

01:24:50.483 --> 01:24:54.817
Blues, made and used
right there on the spot,

01:24:59.326 --> 01:25:01.658
(harmonica playing)

01:25:17.344 --> 01:25:20.336
(children singing nursery rhyme)

01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:22.745
(man) You watchin'?

01:25:34.227 --> 01:25:37.287

01:25:56.483 --> 01:25:58.542
- What's your name?
- Janie, What's yours?

01:25:58.618 --> 01:26:00.950
Nunkie,

- Do I want to pick cucumbers?
- Mm-hm,

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:37.754
Yeah, I want to pick cucumbers!
You miss me when you at work,

01:26:37.824 --> 01:26:40.952

01:26:41.027 --> 01:26:43.359
I think I can handle it!

01:26:44.497 --> 01:26:46.658
The Iunch, the Iunch,,,

01:26:46.733 --> 01:26:49.167
Yeah, yeah, get that, I'm hungry,

01:28:58.331 --> 01:29:03.325
(Janie) I felt for the very first time
like I was livin' my life,

01:29:04.737 --> 01:29:08.901
I had love, and it was real,

01:29:08.975 --> 01:29:14.709
Tea Cake gave me
the whole world every day,

01:29:15.882 --> 01:29:18.214
(native Americans talking)

01:29:23.556 --> 01:29:27.048
- Now, where y'all goin'?
- (man) To high ground,

01:29:28.294 --> 01:29:31.559
Sawgrass bloomed, Hurricane's coming,

01:29:31.965 --> 01:29:36.425
- Oh, they all just scared,
- Oh, I been in the glades for years,

01:29:36.503 --> 01:29:40.098
There ain't nothin' comin' but a Iittle blow,

01:29:46.045 --> 01:29:49.378
Indians is Ieavin'
'cause they say a storm comin',

01:29:49.449 --> 01:29:55.445
Well, if the Indians knew anything,
they'd still own this Iand, wouldn't they?

01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:10.566
- (woman) Come on, now, We gotta git,
- (man) If they don't come, they don't come,

01:30:10.637 --> 01:30:15.665
Why don't you hold that fish up
and Iet the wind blow them scales off?

01:30:18.511 --> 01:30:20.843
Like that?

01:30:27.053 --> 01:30:30.511
- (man) Come on, y'all, hurry up,
- (woman) Step up,

01:30:36.262 --> 01:30:42.531
How about after the harvest
we go and take a Iook around Chicago?

01:30:43.736 --> 01:30:46.068
- Sounds good,
- Mm-hm,

01:30:49.709 --> 01:30:53.076
They crossin' the road in broad daylight,

01:30:57.684 --> 01:31:01.745
Hey, the crows done flew up,
They say that's a bad sign,

01:31:01.821 --> 01:31:04.585
I'm gonna go up north a few miles,

01:31:04.657 --> 01:31:08.252
- It ain't nothing but a Iittle windy,

01:31:08.328 --> 01:31:12.196
I got some space in here

01:31:13.399 --> 01:31:16.664
We go, we gonna Iose

01:31:22.775 --> 01:31:25.005
(thunder)

01:31:34.253 --> 01:31:38.849
Don't worry, If it do rain,
we gonna be safer in the house anyway,

01:31:39.859 --> 01:31:42.521
(thunder)

01:31:50.436 --> 01:31:54.167
- What you doin', Janie?
- I'm watchin' God,

01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:11.153
(thunder crashes)

01:33:01.340 --> 01:33:03.900
- It's gonna be all right,
- I know,

01:33:04.911 --> 01:33:06.902
(crash)

01:33:27.934 --> 01:33:30.698
I reckon you wish
you'd never Ieft the big house

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:34.069
and steered clear
of these storms and such,

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.472
No, this ain't nothing,

01:33:37.210 --> 01:33:39.542
- Hmm,
- It ain't,

01:33:41.547 --> 01:33:45.677
Just with my man
in the middle of a storm, that's all,

01:33:48.321 --> 01:33:50.653
Supposin' we was to die now,

01:33:53.025 --> 01:33:58.725
Well, it don't matter, 'Cause folks

01:33:59.766 --> 01:34:03.930
It's Iike if you can see the Iight of day,

01:34:04.003 --> 01:34:07.837
you really don't care if you die before dusk,

01:34:07.907 --> 01:34:09.898
Mmm,

01:34:10.443 --> 01:34:13.276
I was fumblin' around in the dark,

01:34:13.346 --> 01:34:17.510
God opened the door, and there you was,

01:34:19.986 --> 01:34:23.649
I never knew you were
so satisfied with me Iike that,

01:34:37.570 --> 01:34:39.902
(rumbling and creaking)

01:35:16.776 --> 01:35:18.767
Tea Cake!

01:35:19.779 --> 01:35:21.679
Tea Cake!

01:35:49.175 --> 01:35:50.836
Tea Cake!

01:35:50.977 --> 01:35:53.207
Tea Cake!

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.751
(dog barking)

01:36:16.402 --> 01:36:18.563
Tea Cake!

01:36:18.638 --> 01:36:21.801
(Tea Cake yells)

01:36:24.243 --> 01:36:25.938
Tea Cake?

01:36:26.946 --> 01:36:29.141
Tea Cake!

01:36:31.517 --> 01:36:33.576
Tea Cake!

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:42.919
Tea Cake! Tea Cake!

01:36:43.863 --> 01:36:46.889
Tea Cake, Tea Cake, come on, Come on,

01:37:00.947 --> 01:37:04.713
He woulda torn me to pieces
if it wasn't for you,

01:37:05.685 --> 01:37:08.017
Come here,

01:37:09.822 --> 01:37:15.021
You don't have to say "if it wasn't for me,"
baby, 'cause I'm here,

01:37:17.296 --> 01:37:21.926
§ Simply beautiful §

01:37:37.116 --> 01:37:40.916
(Janie) A week later, the water
had gone back between its banks,

01:37:40.987 --> 01:37:46.391
Ieavin' the lake as calm and as peaceful
as it was the first time I'd seen it,

01:37:47.793 --> 01:37:53.060
Folks came back and pitched in,
tryin' to make things right again,

01:37:53.632 --> 01:37:59.127
All the while, Tea Cake rested,
Said he was tired, was all,

01:38:01.207 --> 01:38:04.370
Brought you a whole bucketful of water,

01:38:12.251 --> 01:38:15.118
- What's wrong?
- Water got somethin' wrong with it,

01:38:15.187 --> 01:38:20.682
- Ain't nothing wrong with the water,
- Why didn't you clean it? You careless!

01:38:28.034 --> 01:38:30.025
(retching)

01:38:38.978 --> 01:38:40.969
(retching continues)

01:38:51.824 --> 01:38:53.849
(groaning)

01:39:06.939 --> 01:39:12.502
(man) Oh, there's nothing wrong with you,
Just a couple of Iittle bites, You'II be fine,

01:39:12.578 --> 01:39:16.275
Just keep Janie out your bed for a while,

01:39:18.484 --> 01:39:24.252
Make sure he takes that medicine, and

01:39:28.294 --> 01:39:30.819
- I wish I'd got to him sooner,
- I'II make sure he,,,

01:39:30.896 --> 01:39:34.354
Gotta get him to the hospital,
They can tie him down and Iook after him,

01:39:34.433 --> 01:39:37.732
- Tie him down?
- It sounds Iike the dog gave him rabies,

01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:43.366
- I got money, so whatever it costs,,,
- He's sick now, he's Iiable to die,

01:39:44.376 --> 01:39:46.867
No, you don't know Tea Cake,
He's just sick,,,

01:39:46.946 --> 01:39:50.382
Shots right afterwards woulda fixed him up,
but he's Iiable to bite,

01:39:50.449 --> 01:39:55.148
- He won't bite, just tell me what to do,
- Specially you, You'II be in the same fix,

01:39:55.221 --> 01:39:57.655
Janie, it might be too Iate,

01:39:57.723 --> 01:40:02.092
but I'II go to Palm Beach and I'II get him
the medicine he shoulda had a week ago,

01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:04.959
It's gonna take me a day or so,
That's the best I can do,

01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:07.362
- OK,
- AII right,

01:40:21.647 --> 01:40:24.309
We gonna get you well,

01:40:25.151 --> 01:40:27.176
Good,

01:40:28.187 --> 01:40:30.883
Good, 'cause you and me got things to do,

01:40:38.864 --> 01:40:41.526
We sure do,

01:40:42.434 --> 01:40:45.426
Since that first time I seen you,,,

01:40:45.504 --> 01:40:47.665

I'm just some old gal
wouldn't nobody want but you, That's it,

01:41:09.228 --> 01:41:11.196
No,

01:41:12.198 --> 01:41:14.189
No, No,

01:41:16.335 --> 01:41:20.863
You only sound old
when you tell people when you was born,

01:41:22.841 --> 01:41:26.470
It's Iike you,,, It's Iike you,,,

01:41:26.545 --> 01:41:29.981
you spent all your old days first
with somebody else,

01:41:30.049 --> 01:41:35.351
and you saved up all your younger days
to spend with me, you hear me?

01:41:37.323 --> 01:41:42.522
Oh, Janie, You're the kinda woman'd

01:41:44.029 --> 01:41:46.361
Forget to die,

Come here,

01:42:10.522 --> 01:42:12.854

01:42:21.500 --> 01:42:23.832
Just get better,

01:42:30.175 --> 01:42:32.769
Every time I see a patch of roses,

all disportin' theyselves,
makin' out Iike they're pretty,

01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:46.220
I say to 'em, "You ain't seen my Janie,"

01:42:58.070 --> 01:43:03.269
You keep sayin' stuff Iike that,
I just might have to believe you,

01:43:06.912 --> 01:43:08.402

- This pillow's soppin' wet,

Here's money for gas, Get Doc Gordon,

01:43:33.339 --> 01:43:35.671
Go as fast as you can,

01:43:45.150 --> 01:43:47.482

Doc Gordon said you need your rest,

01:44:32.464 --> 01:44:33.863

You's gonna run off with Motor Boat,

01:45:55.681 --> 01:45:59.117
Doin' for me, You gonna find yourself

- Don't Iie to me!

01:46:07.893 --> 01:46:11.761

It's just the sickness,
It's got ahold of your mind,

You just can't think straight, that's all,

01:50:23.048 --> 01:50:25.539
It's a movin' thing,

01:50:25.617 --> 01:50:29.314
And it's different on every shore,

01:50:56.481 --> 01:50:58.472
(laughs)

01:51:17.636 --> 01:51:20.332
(Tea Cake) What you doin', Janie?

01:51:22.274 --> 01:51:24.606
I'm watching God,
