00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.174 --> 00:07.208
Michael's coming
home today.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.809
Well, hello, soldier.

00:08.809 --> 00:11.045
MAN:
Michael's unit
had a heavy patient flow.

00:11.045 --> 00:13.681
He'll be unable to make it home
on leave as anticipated.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.316
Hi, I'm Tony Gates.
Dr. Rasgotra.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.717
You don't like my style?!

00:16.717 --> 00:19.187
We were all here
a long time
before you.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.821
We work together.
You're the new guy.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.657
I'm her father.
I have a right to know!
Dad, please!

00:23.657 --> 00:25.593
RASGOTRA:
Stop it!
( groans )

00:25.593 --> 00:28.429
You ever come near
my daughter again

00:28.429 --> 00:29.797
and I'll kill ya.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.338
Wasn't as cold
this morning.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.373
I thought people from the Bronx
are tough.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.541
We are.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.577
Yeah, right.
Talk to me in February.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.113
Hey, what's up?
What's up?

00:45.113 --> 00:46.347
What we got?

00:46.347 --> 00:48.382
Martin Trudeau, 60,
short of breath.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.384
Oh-oh, looks like trouble.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.819
You're telling me.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.387
How's the rookie doing?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.623
Ah, she could smile more.
She's fine.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.591
All I wanted
was a little oxygen,

00:57.591 --> 01:00.228
and these clowns keep poking me
for ten minutes.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.730
Status: post-cardiac
transplant 2001.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.498
Think those bastards
at the Mayo Clinic

01:05.498 --> 01:07.335
give refunds of bad hearts?

01:07.335 --> 01:09.170
Marty here's
on a lot of meds.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.405
Neoral, Mycophenolate, lipitor,
benazepril, nicardipine,

01:11.405 --> 01:13.641
isordil, furosemide,
potassium and aspirin.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.776
Oh, we got freakin'
Rain Man here.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.212
I'm taking her
to Vegas.
Lungs are wet.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.880
40 of Lasix,
25 of sublingual captopril.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.450
How's it going,
for real?

01:22.450 --> 01:28.156
They don't have a coat that
fits, they woke us up at 5 am
and Gates is like a dog in heat.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.158
Other than that...
there's nothing.

01:30.158 --> 01:32.160
Look on the
bright side.
What bright side?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.862
Pratt, your bloody diarrhea guy?
His butt is exploding again.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.597
You could be
stuck here.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.598
Yo, Mayday.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.899
"Dr. Rasgotra"
will be fine.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.734
I'm going to go restock, Mayday.
Thanks.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.371
Nice jacket, roomie.
Or can I still call you that?

01:43.371 --> 01:46.440
Long as you don't call
me "Mayday," you can call me
whatever.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.842
How was the ride-along?
That good, huh?

01:48.842 --> 01:50.778
You need a fresh
steri-strip.

01:50.778 --> 01:51.812
Mm. Ah, ow!
Ow...

01:51.812 --> 01:52.813
Sorry.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.382
Yeah, still a little tender.

01:54.382 --> 01:56.217
All things considered,
you got off easy.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.487
My ass-kicking was a breeze. All
I had to do was lay there.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.788
It beats jail time.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.623
Ah...
Here, sit.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.624
Heard from Gallant?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.359
Not yet.
He got stuck.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.594
He's still
coming home, right?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.761
Not at the moment.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.731
That's cool.
I mean, too bad.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.766
But, uh, maybe
I can come home now?

02:12.766 --> 02:14.202
No.
No?

02:14.202 --> 02:16.237
It's actually quite nice
without you,

02:16.237 --> 02:17.871
and that smell
hasn't been there
since.

02:17.871 --> 02:18.872
It's my place.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.474
Got another run,
Mayday.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.510
You can come back on the
following conditions:

02:22.510 --> 02:25.813
No dirty dishes and no using the
couch as your clothes hamper.

02:25.813 --> 02:27.815
Didn't I let you move in?

02:27.815 --> 02:31.252
Okay, deal. I'm on graveyard.
I'll be back in the morning.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.687
Oh, crap.
Admit, 2:00.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.524
I thought you
got rid of her.
A little help, please?

02:36.524 --> 02:38.459
Ray?
Neela?

02:41.829 --> 02:42.863
Zoe.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.298
Oh, hey, Neela.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.466
Why you here?

02:45.466 --> 02:47.568
Where is Ray?
He's off today.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.603
Well, that's not true. He
pulls doubles Thursdays

02:49.603 --> 02:52.440
so he can do Friday gigs.
I totally know his schedule.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.776
He had a doctor's
appointment,
eye specialist.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.612
He hasn't returned
my calls or anything.
I've been so worried.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.648
Come on.
We got a man
out there.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.716
I'll tell him.
Could you give him this?

03:02.716 --> 03:06.420
It's all our songs.
It's a make-up mix.
Okay.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.356
Hey, residency office
is looking for Abby.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.623
She's on nights.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.260
Lucky her.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.362
Oh, she's on nights.

03:16.000 --> 03:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:40.748 --> 04:43.651
I know why you've got fluid in
your lungs, Mr. Trudeau.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.786
I take long showers.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.889
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

04:50.391 --> 04:51.792
Like what?

04:51.792 --> 04:54.428
Your... your cyclosporin level
was zero.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.963
Yeah, so?!

04:55.963 --> 04:58.999
So you stopped taking
your meds. Am I right?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.468
Are you taking
your pills?

05:00.468 --> 05:02.370
Nope.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.972
You're wasting a perfectly good
heart, not to mention my time.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.642
You know how much the medicine
cost me a month, huh?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.878
I take piles
of that medicine

05:10.878 --> 05:12.980
at almost four large a month.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
What about Medicare?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.818
Oh, please,
you got to declare
poverty for that.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.088
You have to give up your house
and your savings and your car!

05:21.088 --> 05:22.556
Huh?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.092
Who's going to take
care of my wife?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.928
How you supposed to take
care of her if you're dead?

05:27.928 --> 05:31.064
She-She drives me back and forth
to the hospital.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.501
I-I puke,
she cleans it up

05:33.501 --> 05:36.804
and I can't make it up
the stairs alone.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.406
I pass out.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.707
Mr. Trudeau, are you refusing

05:39.707 --> 05:41.542
to take your medication?

05:41.542 --> 05:44.412
Because if you are,
you're going to go
into heart failure

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
and you're gonna die.

05:45.813 --> 05:46.680
Aw...

05:50.017 --> 05:52.820
All right, then.
Put him in Curtain Three.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.122
We're done.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.157
EVE:
Sam, how many nurses
are you short?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.692
Two, and the
registry's empty.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.728
You'll manage. Here's
my hotel number.

06:00.728 --> 06:04.598
My flight leaves at 4:20. I'll
keep my cell phone on.
What about Malik?

06:04.598 --> 06:05.666
Funeral in Detroit.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.900
Arson capital of the world.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.935
Did you try Jarvik?

06:07.935 --> 06:08.936
I called everybody.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.772
Sam, do you want me
to stay?

06:11.772 --> 06:13.607
Oh, go ahead.
We got it. Go.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.042
I got
a flight to catch.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.043
Yo, Rocky.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.645
Hey, Inez.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.680
Wanna pick up
a drunk samurai?
A samurai?

06:19.680 --> 06:22.750
GYN has a bed, but can't take
the PID for two hours.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.452
I'll call 'em.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.654
Why's my UTI still here?
We're out of ICONS.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.489
Yeah, could you, please?
I got it.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.490
Like, before Christmas.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.459
I said I got it.
Four more.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.726
What'd she say?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.962
The same thing
she said the
last six times.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.830
"Kobayashi,"
that's your real name?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.931
Hai.

06:37.931 --> 06:38.999
Irrasshaimase.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.634
Konnichiwa.
Hai.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.703
You, with hair
like ray of sun,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.672
you are beautiful.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.139
Hee-hee!

06:46.139 --> 06:49.076
Ho!

06:57.017 --> 06:58.786
What are you doing?

07:00.220 --> 07:02.790
Looking for my underwear.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.726
You on tonight?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.630
No.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.499
Why are you leaving?

07:11.499 --> 07:14.067
Just thought... I should.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.102
You should stay.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.771
I probably shouldn't.

07:19.206 --> 07:22.910
I have a lot of stuff
I need to... do and...

07:27.881 --> 07:30.718
Oh, your bra.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.852
Thank you.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.624
Panties.

07:39.627 --> 07:42.763
Still like ketchup
on your eggs?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.031
Okay.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.867
I'll make us some breakfast.

07:46.867 --> 07:50.671
I think we probably slept
through breakfast.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.040
And lunch.

07:54.975 --> 07:59.046
I can't believe
he's doing this
to himself.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.114
Can you stop it?

08:01.114 --> 08:04.752
Really, what's the point,
if he's not going
to take the medication?

08:04.752 --> 08:07.955
He's not such a pain in the ass,
you know.

08:07.955 --> 08:10.023
He's just angry
because he's been so sick.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.261
I wish you could
help him.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.999
I'm not sure I can.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.201
He's my life.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.905
I'm not ready to let him go.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.082
Take a cab.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.049
Next time,
fake a seizure.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.721
So how about some sushi?
You like sushi? I know a great
sushi place.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.989
Does he ever stop?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.823
Get a ring.
He's scared of husbands.

08:43.823 --> 08:45.693
I told you
I have a boyfriend.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.595
So what is he,
a lawyer,

08:47.595 --> 08:49.296
a commodities trader,
a dentist?

08:49.296 --> 08:51.098
He's a doctor.
County?

08:51.098 --> 08:53.133
In the Army.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.301
Stateside, I hope.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.335
Iraq.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.604
CASH unit?

08:56.604 --> 08:58.171
Tenth Combat Support.

08:59.907 --> 09:02.643
You know, I was a medic
in Desert Storm,

09:02.643 --> 09:03.777
101st Airborne.

09:03.777 --> 09:04.778
Airborne?

09:04.778 --> 09:05.913
Did you fly planes?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.347
Nope, just jumped
out of them.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.182
When's he coming home?
Soon, I hope.

09:09.182 --> 09:12.653
To prove I'm a good guy,
you know what I'm going to do?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.622
I'm gonna let you sit in front.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.257
and I'm going
to buy you coffee.
With an empty wallet?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.092
ZADRO:
Paramedics and cops
drink for free.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.028
So, technically,
you're not buying
me anything.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.631
Technically,
it's the thought
that counts.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.206
Come on in.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.910
( chuckles )

09:36.910 --> 09:40.347
Sorry, sorry.
I won't do it again.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.086
My foot slipped.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.789
I promise.
Scout's honor.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.995
What took you so long?

09:54.995 --> 09:56.296
Buckle up.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.932
What the hell's that?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.368
Monoclonal antibodies
to stop the rejection.

10:01.368 --> 10:04.004
Did I not make myself clear?
I don't want it.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.639
Yeah? Well, you're
getting it anyway.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.074
And you're gonna
take these, too.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.109
I spoke to your
doctors at the Mayo.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.944
They've agreed to
take you in transfer,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.713
by helicopter.
I'm not going.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.748
This is neoral--
if you take this now,

10:14.748 --> 10:18.285
you'll have a detectable blood
level by the time you get there.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.253
You are so wasting
your time, Doc.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.690
Yeah, so look,
this is how it's gonna go.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.958
You're gonna take these pills,
get on that chopper,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.394
and you're gonna stay on
your meds for as long

10:27.394 --> 10:29.362
as that donated
heart keeps beating.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.665
Who the hell
do you think you are?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.835
You see that woman
over there?

10:34.835 --> 10:36.737
She loves you.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.772
And... and I have
no idea why,

10:38.772 --> 10:41.441
because personally, I find
you extremely annoying.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.712
But if you think you're
helping her by killing
yourself, you're wrong.

10:44.712 --> 10:48.148
You know,
you're a miserable guy.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.684
But she seems
like a great lady,

10:50.684 --> 10:53.320
and she wants
to keep you around.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.823
So open wide, Marty.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.767
( explosion )

11:57.317 --> 11:59.987
( shelves rattling,
glasses clinking )

12:01.388 --> 12:03.256
Careful, it's hot.
Thanks.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.793
( explosion )

12:09.396 --> 12:11.264
NEWSCASTER:
Jet crashed and the fifty seven
hundred.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.433
Are the trauma rooms clear?
And Sutures
and Curtain Two.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.168
CCU can take Jenkins.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.937
I'll get him up next.

12:16.937 --> 12:20.007
If they walk, they go right
to the lobby, you hear me?

12:20.007 --> 12:22.242
I've been waiting six hours with
a dislocated finger!

12:22.242 --> 12:24.845
There's a lot of critical
patients...
My finger's critical!

12:24.845 --> 12:27.147
Excuse me?
My finger's critical!

12:27.147 --> 12:28.816
Let me see that.

12:28.816 --> 12:29.817
( yells in pain )

12:29.817 --> 12:30.851
Not anymore.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.219
Guys, shut up. Please.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.254
Craft struck the
passenger jet at low altitude

12:34.254 --> 12:36.857
moments after takeoff...
Terrorists?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.892
What airline was Eve on?

12:38.892 --> 12:41.361
...the pilot lost control,
eventually colliding

12:41.361 --> 12:45.032
with the ascending jet...
So much for conspiracy
theory, huh?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.466
Okay, that's it, folks.

12:46.466 --> 12:49.002
Here we go.
We're about to get clobbered.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.072
Exam Three--
I want six monitored beds.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.473
Hey!
Damn it!

12:53.473 --> 12:55.508
PRATT:
Ray, I got two
words for you:

12:55.508 --> 12:58.078
hard restraints.
We can't do that anymore.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.313
Hey, settle down!
The warrior's path
is never easy.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.149
Snow him with haldol.
Where's your
attending?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.383
Battalion Chief needs
another doc.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.384
Possible
field amputation.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.253
Yeah, okay.
I could go.

13:06.253 --> 13:09.122
No. It's not a good idea.
I could use
the experience.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.891
It's not a teaching drill.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.361
Have her home by 10:00. Could
you set this up
in the bay?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.196
City Fire needs a physician.
With experience.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.498
Somebody with experience
would be better here.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.434
It's a tough call,
I've done my ride-alongs.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.905
They're gonna need crikes,
central access, chest tubes.
And I'm good at that.

13:24.905 --> 13:29.076
Only if supervised. I'm going.
We need to roll.
You got anybody?

13:29.076 --> 13:33.513
Okay, okay, Pratt, it's
you-- but get your ass
back here in an hour.

13:43.891 --> 13:45.893
GATES:
Drug box, airway kit.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.165
Triage tags.
Let me see these.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.134
Green is nothing,
yellow is urgent,

13:54.134 --> 13:55.969
red is critical,
black is dead.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.611
Oh, man.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.455
( people coughing )

14:25.198 --> 14:26.466
Chief Bukata!

14:26.466 --> 14:28.235
Triage on the north side!

14:28.235 --> 14:30.037
All right,
stick with me.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.042
One patient at a time.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.447
Sir?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.549
Sir?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.217
Sir, can you hear me?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.954
He's not breathing.
There's no pulse.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.388
Black tag and move on.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.968
Ma'am?

15:00.968 --> 15:03.403
Ma'am, can you
open your eyes?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.527
Flail chest,
respiratory arrest.

15:29.729 --> 15:33.366
Trauma One, then ICU.
Quickly, quickly.

15:33.366 --> 15:36.536
Shouldn't the nurses be...
No, you decide who
stays and who goes.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.007
Thanks for coming.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.241
Where do you need us?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.475
Hypotensive pelvis,
ETA two minutes.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.311
We can triage
in the Waiting Room.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.146
What, the Waiting Room?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.149
It's warm, the light is good,
can do a better assessment.

15:49.149 --> 15:50.383
You're not
serious, are you?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.019
That's how
we do it.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.221
This incident is like
Night of the Living Dead.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.757
You let the walking woundeds
through the door, it's over
Triage stays right here.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.759
Abby, this is your pelvis.
Come on.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.595
The plane was going
to Cleveland.
I don't care about that.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.232
Eve was going
to St. Louis.
I'll deal with it.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.167
Who's in Two?

16:07.167 --> 16:09.702
Altered stroke patient.
Let's park him
in the hallway.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.605
Please, yes, I need
you right away. Great.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.642
'Kay, sir, we're gonna
have to move you.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.677
We're gonna have to move
you folks... ( gasps )

16:17.677 --> 16:19.579
I am so sorry
about my dad.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.514
You're not supposed
to be here, Zoe.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.184
I know, but you're so cool
for not pressing charges.

16:24.184 --> 16:27.087
It's not a good time.
You get
off at 8:00?

16:27.087 --> 16:29.722
When I said we can't see each
other, I really meant...

16:29.722 --> 16:33.193
Just 'cause my dad's a jerk
doesn't mean we can't keep it
going.

16:33.193 --> 16:36.063
I got my ass kicked
I don't wanna go to jail.

16:36.063 --> 16:40.400
We could keep it a secret, like
Romeo and Juliet.
No, you need to leave right now.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.471
No. You can't just walk away.
What, don't you have
some homework to do?

16:44.471 --> 16:46.706
I am not a child!
Yes, you are.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.775
I'm your girlfriend!
No, you're not!

16:48.775 --> 16:51.111
Yes, I am!
45-year-old,
unstable pelvis.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.181
90 palp, after a liter--
and can you check
the dorsalis pedis?

16:54.181 --> 16:58.085
But I love you, Ray!
Clogged ear wax.
I had to help clean her out.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.587
Whatever.
Yeah, well, I... Oh!

17:00.587 --> 17:02.189
What are the foot pulses?

17:02.189 --> 17:03.690
Ray?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.759
Keep pressure while I wrap.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.295
Saline's wide open.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.230
Neela!
What are you doing here?

17:10.230 --> 17:12.165
Heard they needed help.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.501
Fire's knocked down
at the fuselage.
Let's go, Pratt.

17:14.501 --> 17:18.338
Woody Evans, 85, auto versus
pedestrian, blunt chest.

17:18.338 --> 17:20.772
Okay, she's not critical,
move her to the yellow tarp.

17:20.772 --> 17:23.276
How's your breathing?
It's been better.

17:23.276 --> 17:26.579
Something fell and hit the car,
and the car came right at me.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.515
'Kay, deep breath.

17:28.515 --> 17:30.283
The driver okay?

17:30.283 --> 17:33.153
We'll have to check on that.
95/60. Tachy 120.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.188
Five liters by
nasal prong.
Got it.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.856
You seen a dog around here?

17:36.856 --> 17:39.526
Hold on, I'm gonna give you
some oxygen here, Woody.

17:39.526 --> 17:43.196
I was walking my dog.
'Kay, big stick
in your arm.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.565
Look over here,
look over here. Over here.
( groans )

17:45.565 --> 17:48.535
A cocker spaniel.
You seen her?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.337
Hold still.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.172
Maybe he didn't get hit,
you know?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.207
You'd have seen her
if she got hit.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.242
Hold on, sir.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.876
Breathe in.
Hey, Riley!

17:56.876 --> 17:59.146
We'll find the dog.
Take a deep breath.

17:59.146 --> 18:02.615
Hey, Riley!

18:04.717 --> 18:06.419
( Pratt groans )

18:07.720 --> 18:08.821
Oh, man!

18:08.821 --> 18:10.357
Anything for us?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.491
BUKATA:
Not in there.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.293
This way, Doc.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.728
Guy in back got lucky.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.536
Coming through!

18:23.536 --> 18:25.772
Up here.
Talk to me.

18:25.772 --> 18:30.643
Baxter Yee, facial
trauma, projectile
to the right chest.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.645
Can someone call
my fiancee?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.714
Well, the airway's good.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.817
Strong pulse.
Unbelievable.
Lila...

18:37.817 --> 18:40.887
Lila Frankfurt is her name.
Line's in.
Need to get him down.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.690
Okay, we need some
Xeroform on this.
And she's...

18:43.690 --> 18:45.892
she is waiting
for me. Oh...

18:45.892 --> 18:48.461
PICKMAN:
Dr. Pratt!

18:48.461 --> 18:50.830
Saw and a backboard!
Let's go!

18:50.830 --> 18:52.332
Baxter, you're
one lucky guy.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.766
Well, can you...
call her cell?

18:53.766 --> 18:57.337
I have the number.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.273
PICKMAN:
Crushing substernal chest pain,
ten out of ten.

19:00.273 --> 19:03.743
Adrian, Dr. Pratt.
What about his arm?

19:03.743 --> 19:06.379
I can't feel it.
170/95.

19:06.379 --> 19:08.748
Yeah, blood pressure's high.
So's my cholesterol.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.517
You taking Viagra?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.252
I look like I need Viagra?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.454
All right, lift up
your tongue for me.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.822
( saw buzzing )

19:15.822 --> 19:18.658
Hey, we need help
with the extrication.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.826
Stand by.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.530
Now, just calm down, sir.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.732
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of here.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.804
105/75.
That's better.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.406
( speaks foreign language )
What?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.408
It means "thank you" in Hindi.

19:35.408 --> 19:38.978
WOODY:
Had to learn a little in '44.
Army Air Force.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.448
I flew supplies
over the hump to China.
( groans )

19:41.448 --> 19:43.783
C-46's?
I've never been
to India.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.886
Hey, she was asleep when the
window blew out.
What's her name?

19:46.886 --> 19:49.422
Olive. The glass cut her.
( child wailing )

19:49.422 --> 19:50.890
My son's
on the second floor.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.959
His legs are cut
and he can't walk.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.594
They'll evacuate
the apartment.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.296
But my building's
not on fire!

19:56.296 --> 19:58.931
It's a precaution.
I can get in and out real quick!

19:58.931 --> 20:02.802
We'll get to him. Go!
Stay here.

20:02.802 --> 20:03.836
( panting )

20:03.836 --> 20:05.638
( loud crying )

20:05.638 --> 20:07.674
OLBES:
Baxter Yee--
passenger on the commuter jet.

20:07.674 --> 20:08.908
And he's still
got vitals?

20:08.908 --> 20:10.009
Blunt face,
penetrating chest.

20:10.009 --> 20:11.778
We've got a trauma room open.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.613
Systolic's
down to 80.
All yours, Kovac.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.248
I'm losing the pulse.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.684
Okay, then prep
for a thoracotomy.
No, no, hold on.

20:17.684 --> 20:18.718
Hold up!
( inhales )

20:18.718 --> 20:20.887
Pressure's coming back.

20:20.887 --> 20:24.557
The dressing converted it
to a tension pneumo.
Good call. Go to Trauma One.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.827
No, I can't waste
a trauma room.
He fell, like, 2,000 feet.

20:27.827 --> 20:30.997
He'll be just fine with the
chest tube. Exam Three. Go.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.932
Hey. Hey,
where the hell is Pratt?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.767
he'll be back
with the next run.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.836
Pratt's out there?
Yeah, they needed a doc.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.671
Well, you gave away
our senior resident?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.540
Not now, 'kay?
I-I got a triage.

20:40.540 --> 20:44.010
We need our doctors here,
not off playing in a field.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.284
Okay, bag 'em.

20:51.284 --> 20:54.987
That central line okay?
Good.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.057
Hey, how's the chest pain?
Down to two out of ten.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.726
Okay, four of MS.

20:59.726 --> 21:01.628
Bukata! We need
some help, man.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.063
As soon as we get these two
out of here.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.766
How's my arm?
It's hard to say.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.737
I guess I'm lucky-- could've
been my head under there.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.038
You still live on Dearborn?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.940
Huh? Yeah.

21:13.940 --> 21:17.009
I came over here
to visit my girlfriend.

21:17.009 --> 21:20.046
( panting ):
I made her bougatsa--

21:20.046 --> 21:23.416
custard in phyllo dough.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.352
Women love a man who can cook.

21:26.819 --> 21:27.854
PVC's on the monitor.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.422
All right, 100 of lidocaine.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.658
So, what, you go
to chef school or something?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.560
When I was a kid,

21:33.560 --> 21:35.895
my mom wouldn't let us watch TV.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.531
That's rough.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.501
We could either cook...
or read a book.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.803
And I never did like...

21:43.803 --> 21:45.772
PICKMAN:
V tach!

21:45.772 --> 21:47.774
( Pratt groaning )

21:47.774 --> 21:49.609
Charge to 200.
Yeah.

21:49.609 --> 21:50.910
Charged.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.645
Adrian.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.046
Okay, clear.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.616
PICKMAN:
Sinus.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.818
Good pulse.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.953
What the hell was that?!

22:00.953 --> 22:03.856
Hey, we can't wait anymore.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.692
Pressure's staying up?
But compare
the radials.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.527
My son's still
in there!

22:07.527 --> 22:10.397
my partner went to check.
He should
be out by now!

22:10.397 --> 22:12.432
Someone will
find your son.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.635
Go ahead, help her.
Pulse discrepancy.
You may have injured your aorta.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.404
WOMAN:
Stop!

22:17.404 --> 22:18.971
I need my stuff!

22:18.971 --> 22:21.140
You're not going in!
My checkbook!
My jewelry!

22:21.140 --> 22:24.110
What is this,
a police state?

22:24.110 --> 22:26.513
( screaming )

22:26.513 --> 22:28.548
You can't do this!
Get away from me!

22:28.548 --> 22:29.782
Take her out of here.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.818
Let me go!
Get her out of here.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.421
Let me go!
You can't do this!

22:34.421 --> 22:35.855
Come back!

22:35.855 --> 22:38.057
Go ahead,
she needs you!
Ma'am!

22:38.057 --> 22:42.795
Ma'am! Stop!
You can't go in there!

22:42.795 --> 22:44.564
Hey! Guys!

22:46.566 --> 22:50.036
( explosions )

22:50.036 --> 22:51.504
( screaming )

22:57.477 --> 22:58.811
Keep moving.
We've got people inside.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.447
Dr. Rasgotra, do you read me?

23:00.447 --> 23:01.548
Are you there?

23:01.548 --> 23:03.015
( coughing ):
Yes.

23:03.015 --> 23:04.784
ALICE:
Somebody help us!

23:04.784 --> 23:06.519
Can anybody
hear me?!

23:06.519 --> 23:08.788
I've got guys inside
the building who can help.

23:08.788 --> 23:12.592
Hold on. Tony!

23:12.592 --> 23:14.026
She's impaled.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.796
Help!
I have a mid-shaft
femur fracture.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.931
Get out of
the building
now, Neela!

23:18.931 --> 23:20.600
Doc, talk to me.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.601
Hold on!

23:21.601 --> 23:24.504
My son! He's in 207!

23:24.504 --> 23:25.705
Neela, go!
Help him!

23:25.705 --> 23:27.106
Get out!

23:27.106 --> 23:29.208
My son! Help him!

23:29.208 --> 23:30.910
Leave the building now!

23:30.910 --> 23:34.113
Please help him!
Hold my hand.
Hold my hand.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.582
Help him!

23:35.582 --> 23:37.183
Doc, acknowledge.

23:37.183 --> 23:41.654
Paramedic Gates and a woman
are trapped inside the basement!

23:43.523 --> 23:45.825
Where are you, Doc?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.661
( over walkie-talkie ):
There's a kid upstairs.
I'm going to get him.

23:48.661 --> 23:51.931
BUKATA:
No, find a door.
Get to a window.
Give me that.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.232
Neela, it's Greg. Turn around.

23:53.232 --> 23:54.734
I'm almost there.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.569
Get your ass out now!

23:56.569 --> 23:58.705
( panting and coughing )

23:58.705 --> 24:01.508
Hello! Hello!

24:01.508 --> 24:03.543
BOY:
I'm in here.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.711
( grunting )

24:04.711 --> 24:07.547
I'm over here!
Hello?!

24:07.547 --> 24:09.749
Hello?!
I'm over here.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.518
I'm over here.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.119
Hey.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.522
Cover your mouth
with this.

24:15.522 --> 24:18.691
( grunting )

24:18.691 --> 24:22.529
BUKATA:
Doc, come in.

24:22.529 --> 24:24.531
Acknowledge, Doc.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.236
Dr. Rasgotra, do you read me?
Are you there?

24:30.236 --> 24:32.605
Neela, respond. Neela!

24:32.605 --> 24:34.841
BUKATA:
Dr. Rasgotra...

24:34.841 --> 24:37.209
Somebody in trouble?
A friend
from work.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.146
The guys are all over
the building. They'll get her.
Here.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.049
This all works out,
I'm baking you two a cake.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.553
I'm more of a low carb guy. All
right, fellas, let's do this.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.559
You can't just eat to live.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.093
Come on.
You gotta live to...

24:54.093 --> 24:55.194
( yelling )

24:58.297 --> 25:00.567
No radial pulse.
No ulna.

25:00.567 --> 25:04.704
( grunts )
Adrian, can you feel this?

25:04.704 --> 25:05.805
Adrian?

25:05.805 --> 25:06.906
PICKMAN:
V tach again.

25:06.906 --> 25:10.042
Charge to 200.
Charged.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.311
Clear.

25:12.311 --> 25:14.113
No change.
All right, 300.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.182
Charging.
Amp of epi.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.183
Charged.
Clear.

25:18.618 --> 25:19.719
Still tach.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.254
Damn it. 360. Intubation kit.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.255
Starting compressions.

25:26.158 --> 25:28.260
RESCUE WORKER
( over walkie-talkie ):
Second floor.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.196
We've got a female body,
no vitals.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.665
RESCUE WORKER 2
( over walkie-talkie ):
Keep looking.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.337
( groaning )

25:38.337 --> 25:39.806
Get up!

25:39.806 --> 25:41.741
Get up!

25:41.741 --> 25:43.209
Who's next for the O.R.?

25:43.209 --> 25:45.845
Avulsed ear in Two, tib fib
in Four, then him.

25:45.845 --> 25:49.081
Haleh, thank you so much
for coming in.

25:49.081 --> 25:52.251
Glad to help. Is Eve here?
No,
but it's okay.

25:52.251 --> 25:56.022
We're out of cefotetan and D.T.
All right,
I'll call the pharmacy.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.625
And I'll get to work.

25:58.625 --> 25:59.992
Is that blood?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.661
You cracked a bone in there.

26:01.661 --> 26:02.829
Minimal chest tube output.

26:02.829 --> 26:04.030
Who called my fiancée?

26:04.030 --> 26:06.065
In a minute, you can
call her yourself.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.701
We were to meet with
the caterers and the DJ.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.102
Vaseline gauze.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.639
Tomorrow it's flowers
and the pastor.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.641
She'll be worried.

26:15.975 --> 26:17.009
Haleh?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.911
Sam called. Good thing, too.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.148
Been home for two weeks and my
husband was driving me crazy.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.182
Glad you're back.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.651
Call for a portable chest.

26:24.651 --> 26:25.652
( gagging )

26:25.652 --> 26:26.753
Sats are dropping.

26:29.355 --> 26:30.823
LOCKHART:
Baxter?

26:30.823 --> 26:32.792
Baxter.

26:32.792 --> 26:35.227
He's not breathing.

26:37.296 --> 26:38.998
Knocked out the alveolar
ridge-- fracture

26:38.998 --> 26:40.800
teeth nine, ten
and 11.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.201
Must have aspirated
the fragment.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.335
Try a finger sweep.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.678
Another 50 of lidocaine.
Got it.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.079
They ID the body in there?

26:53.079 --> 26:56.215
Woman in her 80s.
Still looking.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.817
( crying ):
Where's my mom?

26:57.817 --> 26:59.886
Where is she?

26:59.886 --> 27:01.320
Find anybody else inside?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.355
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. He's awake.

27:03.355 --> 27:04.390
Holding compressions.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.391
Still v-tach.

27:05.391 --> 27:06.859
No pulse.
What the hell?

27:06.859 --> 27:08.394
Adrian. Adrian.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.396
Can you hear me?

27:10.396 --> 27:14.000
Your heart stopped beating.
We're doing CPR. Keep going.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.435
The compressions are getting
oxygen to his brain.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.905
We're gonna get you
to the hospital, all right?

27:22.842 --> 27:24.143
( grunting )

27:24.143 --> 27:26.879
( coughing )

27:42.729 --> 27:45.197
You had no business
going in there.
I'm sorry.

27:45.197 --> 27:48.034
You put yourself in danger,
you put my men in danger.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.402
Can we talk about
this later?
We will.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.474
Woody, you found your dog.

27:55.474 --> 27:59.078
Probably blew out
his aorta.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.847
I was just talking to him.

28:03.315 --> 28:04.817
ZADRO:
Over here, Doc!

28:10.757 --> 28:12.859
Large bore IV, O2 15 liters.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.127
Take Mom and the kids together.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.495
( coughing ):
Doctor...

28:16.495 --> 28:19.431
( labored breathing ):
Thank you.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.333
Neela!

28:21.333 --> 28:22.434
Pressure's borderline.

28:22.434 --> 28:27.039
( wheezing )

28:28.507 --> 28:30.176
What's he got?

28:30.176 --> 28:31.944
Distal neuro-circ is intact.

28:31.944 --> 28:33.780
You can stop being
the med student.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.948
As soon as you stop
being the firefighter.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.521
( groans )

28:42.521 --> 28:45.024
Tongue is too
edematous.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.928
Okay, bag him a few times.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.797
I can prep his neck.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.431
Take another look,
I'll retract.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.236
PVC's.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.405
I'll get
the crash cart.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.472
There it is.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.011
Got it.

29:06.445 --> 29:07.880
( gasping )

29:07.880 --> 29:09.548
See something
new every day.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.183
All right,
settle down.
Settle down.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.184
Settle down.
Okay.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.352
15 liters by mask.

29:16.555 --> 29:17.824
Nice work.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.191
You did great.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.396
Probable MI
with refractory v fib.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.431
KOVAC & CLEMENTE:
Trauma One.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.299
And an ischemic right arm.

29:27.299 --> 29:28.901
KOVAC & CLEMENTE:
Be right in.

29:30.202 --> 29:32.438
Inez, she needs to get
to the Suture Room.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.273
Nah, she doesn't need
the Suture Room.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.574
It's a complicated lac.

29:35.574 --> 29:37.043
Nope, not that complicated.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.215
What, you've never seen
The Zipper before?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.022
RASGOTRA:
Any chest pain?

29:50.022 --> 29:51.090
( groans ):
My belly.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.059
Probably just
broke a rib.

29:53.059 --> 29:56.128
It's his liver. Scoop and run.
Soon as we get
another rig.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.565
We don't have an ambulance?
We just sent 30 patients in.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.133
Heart rate's up to 140.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.969
'Cause
I'm in pain.
Maybe.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.603
Elevate my legs. Shock position.

30:04.603 --> 30:06.438
I need to stick your belly.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.107
Peritoneal
aspiration?

30:08.107 --> 30:10.209
Maybe you should numb up my...
( yells )

30:10.209 --> 30:11.878
( groans ):
Ow!

30:12.845 --> 30:14.981
It's positive.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.315
Splenic lac?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.349
More likely hepatic.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.985
Oh, I was hoping for spleen.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.253
Do we have lap pads?
Just burn dressings.

30:21.253 --> 30:22.454
Ten of them.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.090
Push etomidate.
What are you doing?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.525
Tony, I need to sedate you,
open up your belly

30:26.525 --> 30:27.960
and pack off your liver.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.428
What?!
You can't
be serious.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.264
Do I have your permission?
Will you go out with me?

30:32.264 --> 30:34.066
I need to do this.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.970
If you didn't have a boyfriend.
Yes or no?
Yes.

30:37.970 --> 30:39.271
I'm all yours.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.040
Okay, bag him
through this.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.312
From the subxiphoid

30:46.312 --> 30:48.214
through the symphysis pubis.

30:48.214 --> 30:49.381
PRATT:
Clear!

30:49.381 --> 30:51.450
BARNETT:
Still v fib.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.452
When's the last time
you saw her?

30:53.452 --> 30:56.555
I told you, we were
a block apart.
Resuming compressions.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.257
Amiodarone's
on board?
Five minutes ago.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.292
You should have
kept an eye on her.

31:00.292 --> 31:01.493
Pronestyl drip?
Infusing.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.462
What, you could
have done better?

31:03.462 --> 31:06.498
I wouldn't have let her go inI
wouldn't have left her there.

31:09.635 --> 31:10.970
Guys.

31:14.673 --> 31:18.177
You're doing okay, Adrian.

31:18.177 --> 31:19.245
Hey, take a break.

31:19.245 --> 31:22.614
I got it.
Greg. Go.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.650
Adrian, we're doing
what we can, okay?

31:26.218 --> 31:28.187
TAGGART:
Here.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.522
All you do is point, okay?

31:38.164 --> 31:41.233
Okay, we're using all
the medication we can
to fix your heart.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.969
Sometimes it takes a while.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.603
Anything else?

31:54.013 --> 31:56.482
TAGGART:
You want your family?

31:58.084 --> 32:01.053
We called them.
They're on their way.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.101
15-foot fall!
I packed off the liver!

32:15.101 --> 32:16.335
Whoa, whoa, in the field?

32:16.335 --> 32:17.369
Damn, girl.

32:17.369 --> 32:18.604
He was about to arrest.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.339
Pressure's up at 100 systolic.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.175
Was he awake
when you opened him up?
I had etomidate.

32:23.175 --> 32:26.012
It's always the quiet ones,
isn't it? Always the quiet ones.

32:26.012 --> 32:29.515
I'll take him up to the O.R. You
let Dubenko finish.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.151
You got big huevos, Neela.
They look good on you!

32:32.151 --> 32:36.422
I had no idea what else to do.
Need to put
you on a pulse ox.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.657
Yeah, you sound terrific.
No, I'm okay.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.160
Singed nasal hairs-- that
indicates substantial
smoke inhalation.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.195
I just need to
wash off a bit?

32:43.195 --> 32:45.231
I would
hate for you to
stop breathing.

32:45.231 --> 32:47.099
I'd hate that, too.
Neela, come on.

32:47.099 --> 32:49.735
Can I at least pee first?
I'll get you a bedpan.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.670
( coughing )

32:54.240 --> 32:56.575
94 on room air.
That's not great.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.278
And there are some
expiratory wheezes.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.746
Those will pass.
Or get worse.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.748
I'm a little bit
worried here.

33:02.748 --> 33:04.583
( breathing heavily )

33:04.583 --> 33:05.751
Hello?

33:05.751 --> 33:06.685
I'm sorry.

33:06.685 --> 33:08.720
I was just...

33:08.720 --> 33:13.225
Today was so... terrifying.

33:13.225 --> 33:15.194
And amazing.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.629
There was no labs,
no X rays, no rapid infusers

33:17.629 --> 33:20.299
or cutdown trays-- just me.

33:20.299 --> 33:23.669
Maybe it's
the adrenaline, but...

33:23.669 --> 33:24.803
I feel high.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.073
I need to go back out.

33:27.073 --> 33:29.475
Sounds like I should call
for a psych consult.

33:29.475 --> 33:31.077
( inhales deeply )

33:31.077 --> 33:33.079
There are still patients
out there.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.580
Yes, and they're
being handled.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.747
INEZ:
Excuse me, Abby.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.749
Dubenko called
from the O.R.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.718
Alice Watson died
on the table.

33:39.718 --> 33:41.653
Okay, thanks.

33:42.754 --> 33:43.789
Patient of yours?

33:43.789 --> 33:45.791
Impaled abdomen.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.093
From the crash?

33:48.127 --> 33:49.461
Where are her kids?

33:49.461 --> 33:50.462
Exam Two.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.231
( breathing heavily )

33:52.231 --> 33:56.468
( groaning )

33:56.468 --> 33:58.170
You need to be monitored.

34:09.715 --> 34:12.150
Hi.

34:12.150 --> 34:13.719
KOVAC:
Hey, Abby.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.286
How's he doing?

34:15.286 --> 34:18.123
Um, lung is up
after two chest tubes.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.491
We're going up to ICU.

34:19.491 --> 34:20.726
So I stopped breathing?

34:20.726 --> 34:23.395
Uh, it was more like
holding your breath.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.463
But I could've died?

34:24.463 --> 34:25.764
Theoretically, yeah.

34:25.764 --> 34:28.400
I think you were
in more danger on the plane.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.138
Oh, I cheated death twice today.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.605
You're lucky.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.373
I guess I should
feel bad,

34:35.373 --> 34:38.310
or guilty or something.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.647
But truth is, I feel...

34:42.813 --> 34:44.150
( voice breaking ):
happy.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.687
I have a second chance.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.190
I'm calling off the wedding.

34:52.757 --> 34:55.427
Oh, uh, you might want
to sleep on that.

34:55.427 --> 34:59.198
No, I have been sleeping
my whole life.

34:59.198 --> 35:03.902
I never do what I want to do,
I never say how I really feel.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.305
I'm not in love with her.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.207
Maybe you two should
talk about that.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.841
Screw that!

35:09.841 --> 35:11.810
Screw it.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.646
No more messing with could've,
should've, would've.

35:14.646 --> 35:18.917
Carpe diem!

35:18.917 --> 35:22.521
All right, well...
good luck with that.

35:22.521 --> 35:26.492
Besides, I'm pretty sure
I'm... I'm gay.

35:28.794 --> 35:29.761
PRATT:
Getting tired?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.597
RAY:
No.

35:31.597 --> 35:35.201
TAGGART:
Dr. Pratt, this is
Adrian's girlfriend,

35:35.201 --> 35:36.468
his brother
and his uncle.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.437
I explained
everything.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.307
I'm sorry. We gave
him every kind of
medication possible.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.941
Nothing's working
right now.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.611
He's awake. You can talk
to him, if you want.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.945
You hang on.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.480
Everyone's coming.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.649
Pratt, check it out.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.290
Well, I guess
she's okay, then.

35:58.290 --> 36:00.526
Yeah.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.394
Ah, it's alive.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.664
They shut down the Dan Ryan.
It took two hours to get here.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.699
Where do you
need me?
How about Peoria?

36:07.699 --> 36:09.401
Uh, how did we do?

36:09.401 --> 36:10.569
Still here.

36:10.569 --> 36:12.271
No ICU boarders?
None.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.406
Hmm, and we're
reopen for Trauma?
Yup.

36:14.406 --> 36:17.509
Hey, call housekeeping
for T-One, pharmacy's
here to re-stock.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.378
KOBAYASHI:
Excuse me.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.513
Could someone please
remove these?

36:21.513 --> 36:22.881
Go for it.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.684
Sir, why are you restrained?

36:25.684 --> 36:26.885
I have no idea.

36:29.888 --> 36:31.857
Hey, Sam.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.692
Uh...
More Sianis
family members.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.926
I'll be right there.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.828
Sam, what is
Haleh doing here?

36:36.828 --> 36:37.929
Uh, Exam Two's going

36:37.929 --> 36:39.765
up to Four-West.
I can help Pratt

36:39.765 --> 36:42.268
with the trauma.
Did you bring her back?

36:42.268 --> 36:44.903
Yeah. Listen, Haleh is one
of the best nurses in town.

36:44.903 --> 36:48.674
We're getting our asses handed
to us. I did whatever
I thought I could.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.909
Good move.

36:52.478 --> 36:53.879
( coughing )

36:53.879 --> 36:56.715
You need a chest X ray.
I told you I'm fine.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.386
Tell the kids I'll check
on them in the morning.
Oh, Neela! Come on.

37:00.386 --> 37:02.020
Please? I've been on
for 16 hours.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.723
What if your lungs get worse?
I'll call 911.

37:04.723 --> 37:07.359
Just stay at the hospital.
Sleep in the call room.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.629
I need to be
at home tonight
That's not be safe.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.965
If I start to die, you'll
be the first one I'll call.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.801
I'll come
and stay at your place.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.437
It's not necessary.
Oh.

37:18.437 --> 37:21.740
Okay, is there anything,
anything I can say
to get you to stay?

37:21.740 --> 37:23.041
No.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.476
I slept with Luka.

37:24.476 --> 37:25.877
Yeah, nice try.

37:35.321 --> 37:36.655
I can bag.

37:36.655 --> 37:39.725
So how's this gonna go
if you stop?

37:39.725 --> 37:42.060
There'll be a lack of
oxygen to the brain.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.463
He'll pass out like
going to sleep.

37:44.463 --> 37:46.798
Is he gonna
be in pain?

37:46.798 --> 37:49.535
He's had a sedative,
he'll be comfortable.

37:52.338 --> 37:55.474
And you've done everything?

37:58.076 --> 37:59.711
Yes, we have.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.965
What, you want us to stop?

38:27.906 --> 38:30.409
Are you ready?

38:32.778 --> 38:34.980
No.

38:34.980 --> 38:36.948
( woman crying )

38:52.564 --> 38:55.667
( wailing ):
No...

39:04.410 --> 39:05.511
( moaning sobs )

39:12.017 --> 39:14.620
9:42 p.m.

39:14.620 --> 39:18.590
WOMAN ( sobbing ):
No...

39:20.058 --> 39:23.094
I'm sorry.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.896
No!

39:33.138 --> 39:34.440
( sighs )

39:40.546 --> 39:43.449
He was a lucky guy.

39:43.449 --> 39:45.016
He's dead.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.153
A lot of people loved him.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.456
They all got a chance
to say good-bye.

39:51.957 --> 39:52.958
( sighs heavily )

39:54.526 --> 39:56.528
All right, you gotta stop
calling me.

39:56.528 --> 40:00.098
No, 'cause-'cause we're done.
We've been done.

40:00.098 --> 40:04.169
No... no... no, 'cause you,
you're not listening to me.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.805
You're not... Let me,
let me say it to you

40:06.805 --> 40:08.874
really nice and slow
for the last time.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.510
I... don't... love you.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.480
Go back to your husband.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.115
Hey, Dr. Kovac.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.751
You know, you and I
should have
a little sit-down.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.752
Yeah, probably.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.588
No, I think
like definitely.

40:22.588 --> 40:25.056
Look, we're both captains
on this team here, right?

40:25.056 --> 40:29.728
And if we break down, the whole
machine breaks down we can't
have that, on days like today.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.697
I agree.

40:31.697 --> 40:34.966
Well, 'cause, see, I thought
I was the incident commander.

40:34.966 --> 40:37.603
You know what,
let's talk
tomorrow, okay?

40:37.603 --> 40:39.471
Yeah, tomorrow's great.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.139
I'll be here all day,

40:41.139 --> 40:44.543
8:00 to 8:00.

40:49.114 --> 40:50.248
Hey.

40:50.248 --> 40:52.751
Hi.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.222
Rough night.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.657
Yeah, I'm glad
it's over.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.626
Yeah, me, too.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.896
Ah, did Baxter
get upstairs okay?

41:04.896 --> 41:07.533
Oh, he's fine. Not so sure
about his fiancée, though.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.100
( soft chuckle )

41:09.100 --> 41:11.537
Hey, I was thinking...
Listen,
I was thinking of...

41:11.537 --> 41:12.804
Sorry.
No, you go ahead.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.205
No.
Go ahead.

41:14.205 --> 41:15.541
Well...

41:16.908 --> 41:18.243
( chuckling ):
Okay.

41:18.243 --> 41:21.012
No, I was just
thinking about, uh...

41:21.012 --> 41:25.817
uh... I was thinking...
about what happened last night.

41:30.956 --> 41:34.025
It was nice.

41:36.862 --> 41:38.196
Nice?

41:38.196 --> 41:40.899
Yeah.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.568
Wasn't it?

41:42.568 --> 41:44.736
No... yeah, of course.

41:45.904 --> 41:48.774
But...
What?

41:48.774 --> 41:50.809
I don't know.

41:56.815 --> 41:59.250
I don't know.
What do we do now?

41:59.250 --> 42:00.586
Not sure. Um...

42:10.028 --> 42:13.599
For a long time, even when
we weren't connecting a lot,

42:13.599 --> 42:16.602
you... you've been one
person I can count on.

42:19.170 --> 42:22.708
I feel like that, too.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.710
That means a lot to me,
that friendship.

42:26.311 --> 42:27.613
Me, too.

42:30.616 --> 42:33.118
So?

42:33.118 --> 42:36.321
Maybe we should just
leave it at that, then.

42:38.857 --> 42:40.859
( inhales deeply )

42:40.859 --> 42:43.995
I don't know.
I don't want to lose that,
you know,

42:43.995 --> 42:46.832
but if that's what
you, um... that's what...
what's the best...

42:46.832 --> 42:51.937
So what we're just saying
is that we'll just
stay friends, then?

42:51.937 --> 42:55.173
Need a lift?

42:56.808 --> 43:01.079
No. I have, um, some stuff
I need to finish inside.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.648
Oh.

43:02.648 --> 43:03.982
Okay.
Good night.

43:03.982 --> 43:06.017
See you.

43:22.300 --> 43:26.838
( coughing )

44:03.709 --> 44:05.944
