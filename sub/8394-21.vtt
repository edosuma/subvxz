WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:01.919
- WE HAD TO RIP IT UP
TO GET TO THE MOLD.

00:02.030 --> 00:03.236
I'D ESTIMATE AROUND 12 GRAND.

00:03.340 --> 00:04.784
- $12,000 TO GET
MY FAMILY BACK IN THE HOUSE?

00:04.900 --> 00:06.822
- OH, HEY, DREW.

00:06.930 --> 00:08.340
YOU LOOKING FOR NATALIE?

00:08.450 --> 00:09.860
- DESPITE EVERYTHING I'VE DONE,
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

00:09.970 --> 00:10.891
I DON'T WANT TO
PUSH YOU AWAY.

00:11.010 --> 00:14.480
I LIKE BEING AROUND YOU
TOO MUCH.

00:14.600 --> 00:15.168
- I HAD SOME PRE'ITY
ROUGH TIMES

00:15.290 --> 00:17.975
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL MYSELF.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.388
- NOT THIS ROUGH.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.219
- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY
STARTING OUR OWN SCHOOL.

00:22.330 --> 00:23.285
- WE WANT YOU
TO RUN OUR SCHOOL.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.731
- ARE WE TRYING
TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

00:24.850 --> 00:26.294
- NO.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.391
WE'RE NOT WORKING ON
OUR RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

00:32.370 --> 00:33.291
- MAX.

00:33.410 --> 00:34.923
- YOU ARE A NAZI FASCIST
WITH A CRAPPY CAR

00:35.030 --> 00:36.759
THAT SMELLS LIKE JOCKSTRAPS
AND BURRITOS.

00:36.860 --> 00:38.782
- NAZI IS A BIT EXTREME.
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE UPSET.

00:38.900 --> 00:39.753
MAX. MAX.
SORRY.

00:39.860 --> 00:40.827
- WHOA.

00:40.930 --> 00:43.103
MAX, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET,

00:43.210 --> 00:43.938
BUT YOU DIDN'T FINISH
YOUR HOMEWORK AT THE STUDIO.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.553
- OKAY. NO.

00:45.660 --> 00:47.719
IT DOESN'T MA'I'I'ER BECAUSE
THE AVERAGE HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT

00:47.840 --> 00:49.455
IS 25 WORD PROBLEMS,

00:49.560 --> 00:52.734
BUT TODAY, MR. WOLPERT,
WHO IS A BALDING ASS--

00:52.840 --> 00:54.046
- I'M SURE.
I'M SURE HE IS.

00:54.150 --> 00:56.186
- ASSIGNED 35 PROBLEMS,
WHICH IS 10 TOO MANY.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.848
AND SO I COULD NOT
FINISH THEM IN TIME.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.224
- JUST TAKE A BREATH.

00:59.330 --> 01:01.810
- AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE NORTHBOUND TRAIN

01:01.920 --> 01:03.148
OUT OF CRESTLINE STATION.

01:03.270 --> 01:04.123
- BUT YOU HAVE TO
DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.334
THAT'S THE PLAN. MAX!

01:06.440 --> 01:06.815
I AM SO SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

01:06.920 --> 01:08.023
- MAX, STOP!

01:08.130 --> 01:10.337
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
IT'S OKAY.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.884
- I'M REALLY SORRY.
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.137
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED, MAX.
I GET IT.

01:13.240 --> 01:13.820
- YES.
I'M VERY FRUSTRATED

01:13.930 --> 01:14.999
AT THE CURRENT SITUATION.

01:15.100 --> 01:15.964
- SHE CHANGE THE SCHEDULE
ON YOU?

01:16.070 --> 01:17.924
THAT'S NOT COOL.
- WELL...

01:18.040 --> 01:19.200
- YES, SHE DID.
- YEAH. THAT'S NOT COOL.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.207
- IT IS NOT COOL.
- NO.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.173
THEY DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

01:21.280 --> 01:22.349
ADULTS. RIGHT?
- YES.

01:22.460 --> 01:23.597
- THE STUPID,
STUPID CRAP THEY DO.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.043
BUT SOMEHOW YOU GOT
TO ROLL WITH IT.

01:26.150 --> 01:27.799
- STUDIO TIME
IS 3:00 TO 5:00.

01:27.910 --> 01:28.592
- I KNOW.
YOU WANT THE STUDIO TIME.

01:28.700 --> 01:30.804
- YES.
IT IS MY RIGHT AS A CITIZEN.

01:30.910 --> 01:32.844
- YEAH, BUT ONE OF THE RULES
IS THE HOMEWORK COMES FIRST.

01:32.950 --> 01:34.360
RIGHT?
THAT'S A RULE.

01:34.470 --> 01:35.869
SO HOW ABOUT WE DO A PLAN B

01:35.990 --> 01:38.845
WHERE YOU DO THE HOMEWORK FIRST,
AND THEN WE DO OUR THING?

01:38.960 --> 01:40.120
AND IF IT TAKES 30 MINUTES,

01:40.230 --> 01:40.912
WE'LL DO 30 MINUTES
MORE STUDIO TIME.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.055
IF IT TAKES 40 MINUTES,

01:43.170 --> 01:44.785
THEN WE'LL DO 40 MINUTES
MORE STUDIO TIME.

01:44.890 --> 01:47.131
DEAL?

01:47.240 --> 01:49.026
- DEAL.
- OKAY.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.755
THAT'S HOW WE'LL DO IT.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.727
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO
KNOCK OVER YOUR LAMP.

01:53.830 --> 01:54.751
- NO. I KNOW YOU DIDN'T.

01:54.870 --> 01:57.907
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.069
UH...
- THANKS.

02:00.180 --> 02:00.976
- SHOULD PROBABLY GET
AN AIR FRESHENER, RIGHT?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.071
FOR YOUR CAR.

02:03.190 --> 02:04.418
- YES. IT SMELLS LIKE
JOCKSTRAPS AND BURRITOS.

02:04.530 --> 02:06.839
- THANK YOU GUYS. WOW.
YOU'RE LIKE PEAS IN A POD.

02:06.950 --> 02:09.327
- THEY'RE SAYING I'VE GOT TO
RIP OUT THE WHOLE SUBFLOOR

02:09.430 --> 02:10.909
AND RE-DO ABSOLUTELY
EVERYTHING.

02:11.020 --> 02:13.261
EACH BID
IS WORSE THAN THE LAST.

02:13.370 --> 02:15.509
EVERY TIME THEY LOOK AT ME,
THE PRICE GOES UP.

02:15.610 --> 02:17.237
AND I'VE GOT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU, JOEL.

02:17.340 --> 02:18.989
I HAVE A CASH FLOW
PROBLEM RIGHT NOW.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.579
I HAVE ZERO FLOW.

02:20.690 --> 02:22.066
- YEAH.
I SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

02:22.170 --> 02:25.298
YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE STANDING
WATER IN YOUR CRAWL SPACE?

02:25.420 --> 02:26.580
- THAT'S A TYPE OF WHAT?

02:26.690 --> 02:27.964
- IT'S A TYPE OF WATER.
- OH, YOU MEAN I HAVE--

02:28.070 --> 02:30.004
- IT'S JUST SITTING.
- OH, NO.

02:30.110 --> 02:31.452
- YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S FROM?
- NO. HUH?

02:31.560 --> 02:31.935
- THAT'S FROM THE WATER HEATER
I TOLD YOU TO MOVE

02:32.040 --> 02:32.938
FROM THE ATI'IC.

02:33.040 --> 02:34.905
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

02:35.010 --> 02:36.045
- YES. I DO.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.879
- ALL IT HAS TO DO IS CRACK

02:37.980 --> 02:40.084
ANYWHERE FROM HERE DOWN TO HERE.
YOU'LL NEVER KNOW ABOUT IT,

02:40.190 --> 02:41.009
AND THEN IT'S JUST
LIKE NOAH'S ARK.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.189
- LISTEN. HEY.

02:42.300 --> 02:43.631
IF I COULD MARTY MCFLY IT
AND GO BACK

02:43.740 --> 02:44.911
AND TELL THE YOUNGER VERSION
OF MYSELF TO LISTEN TO YOU,

02:45.020 --> 02:46.942
I PROMISE THAT I WOULD.

02:47.060 --> 02:48.152
I JUST--I NEED TO KNOW

02:48.270 --> 02:49.646
ARE THESE GUYS
TRYING TO SCREW ME?

02:49.750 --> 02:50.603
- OH, YEAH.

02:50.720 --> 02:51.857
THEY'RE TOTALLY
TRYING TO SCREW YOU.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.301
YEAH, YOU DON'T NEED TO REPATCH
THE WHOLE FLOOR.

02:52.410 --> 02:54.401
- OH! REALLY?

02:54.510 --> 02:55.238
- YEAH. ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- OKAY.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.023
- NOW THIS SECTION HERE, YEAH.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.516
PROBABLY UP TO THAT STUD.
- UH-HUH.

02:58.620 --> 03:01.373
- AND THEN IT'S JUST HARDWOOD.

03:01.490 --> 03:03.208
YOU KNOW, RESAND IT,
RESTAIN IT.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.140
IT'S DOABLE.
IT'S NOT A SMALL JOB.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.217
BUT...

03:06.320 --> 03:07.389
- BUT IT'S NOT A HUGE JOB.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.003
LIKE, ONE GUY OR TWO

03:09.110 --> 03:11.908
COULD TEAM UP ON IT
AND KNOCK IT OUT,

03:12.010 --> 03:13.568
YOU THINK?

03:13.670 --> 03:15.535
JUST ROLL THEIR SLEEVES UP AND--

03:15.640 --> 03:16.015
- YEAH. ONE GUY.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.018
ONE GUY.
- ONE GUY?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.917
- YEP.
- GREAT.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.396
AND IF HE KNEW, LIKE,
SOMEBODY THAT WAS QUICK

03:20.510 --> 03:23.263
WITH HARDWOOD FLOORS
WOULD PROBABLY JUST JUMP ON IT.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.598
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW,

03:24.720 --> 03:26.028
IT'S PROBABLY BETI'ER
FOR THAT ONE GUY

03:26.130 --> 03:29.167
TO HEAD TO HOME DEPOT HIMSELF
AND THEN GET ON YOUTUBE

03:29.270 --> 03:30.578
AND THEN DO IT HIMSELF.

03:30.690 --> 03:32.305
'CAUSE THEN HE KNOWS.
- RIGHT.

03:32.410 --> 03:33.616
- THEN HE KNOWS.
- AND THEN IT WOULD

03:33.730 --> 03:35.038
ALSO BE SMART
JUST TO DOUBLE BACK

03:35.140 --> 03:37.415
WITH SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE HOUSE
INSIDE AND OUT PROBABLY.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.509
- CROSBY.
[phone rings]

03:38.630 --> 03:40.313
- WHAT? THOUGHT I WAS--
- THAT'S WORK.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.899
I'M SO SORRY.
- YEAH. GO AHEAD.

03:42.010 --> 03:42.908
YEAH. GO AHEAD.
- YEAH?

03:43.010 --> 03:45.831

03:45.940 --> 03:46.907
YEAH.

03:47.010 --> 03:48.454
- HEY, GOOD LUCK,
AND LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES.

03:48.570 --> 03:49.525
- YEAH.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.493
- GOOD LUCK
ON THAT PHONE CALL.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.740
- YEAH. HEY--

03:54.060 --> 03:57.644
[door closes]

03:57.750 --> 04:00.856
[waves crashing,
birds calling]

04:21.260 --> 04:23.080
[knocking]

04:23.190 --> 04:25.465
- HEY.

04:25.570 --> 04:26.252
HOW YOU DOING?
YOU STRESSING OUT?

04:26.360 --> 04:29.295
- YEAH.
I'M JUST STUDYING.

04:33.030 --> 04:34.099
- ARE YOU SERIOUSLY NOT
GONNA TALK TO ME?

04:34.200 --> 04:36.304
I'M, LIKE, THREE FEET AWAY.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.126
- YOU'RE SERIOUSLY
NOT GONNA ACKNOWLEDGE

04:37.240 --> 04:39.162
THAT YOU SLEPT WITH BERTO?

04:39.270 --> 04:40.271
NOTHING?

04:40.380 --> 04:41.517
- DREW, COME ON.
- WHAT?

04:41.620 --> 04:44.100
NO. YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
TO RELAX AGAIN

04:44.210 --> 04:45.825
BECAUSE WE'RE IN COLLEGE,

04:45.940 --> 04:48.511
WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

04:48.630 --> 04:50.074
TO BOTH OF US, OKAY?

04:50.180 --> 04:51.317
I DON'T CARE.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.071
YOU CAN HOOK UP
WITH MY DISGUSTING ROOMMATE.

04:54.190 --> 04:56.590
LOOK. I'M TRYING TO STUDY.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.086
AND I DON'T EVEN CARE
WHAT YOU DO.

04:58.190 --> 04:59.737
YOU CAN DO--WHATEVER.

04:59.850 --> 05:01.465
DON'T GIVE ME THAT LOOK.
ALL RIGHT?

05:01.570 --> 05:03.947
I'M STUDYING
'CAUSE I'M BEHIND NOW.

05:04.060 --> 05:07.712
AND WE HAVE FINALS.

05:07.820 --> 05:10.471
[sighs]

05:10.580 --> 05:13.196
- WELL, I WAS JUST GOING TO
OFFER YOU MY ASTRONOMY NOTES

05:13.310 --> 05:16.234
'CAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY
BEEN TO CLASS LATELY.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.341
BUT GOOD LUCK.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.351
- THIS ONE'S IN
OUR PRICE RANGE, BUT...

05:32.470 --> 05:33.255
- YEAH. MY GOODNESS.

05:33.360 --> 05:35.294
- IT'S BEEN EMPTY
FOR A WHILE.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.288
- HEY, GUYS.
SORRY I'M LATE.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.844
- HI.

05:38.950 --> 05:39.848
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.120
- HI.

05:43.230 --> 05:45.369
- HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YEAH.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.163
- ALL RIGHT.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.966

[clears throat]

05:50.070 --> 05:51.230
- OKAY.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.342
- OKAY.
A CHARMING FIXER.

05:54.450 --> 05:57.169
- YEP.
- THAT'S A LITTLE GENEROUS.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.760
- I DON'T KNOW.
- BUT...

05:59.870 --> 06:01.144
- WELL.
- I KIND OF LIKE IT.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.241
I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S HISTORY HERE.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.691
- YOU DO?
- YEAH.

06:04.810 --> 06:05.765
I SEE POTENTIAL.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.108
I SEE WE COULD
PUT UP SOME PARTITIONS,

06:07.220 --> 06:09.108
FOUR CLASSROOMS, ASSEMBLIES,

06:09.230 --> 06:10.322
TEACHERS, LUNCH ROOM.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.943
- A LOT OF WINDOWS.
GOOD PASSIVE SOLAR.

06:12.060 --> 06:13.709
- THE PRICE IS RIGHT. REALLY.
- PRICE IS RIGHT.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.082
- HIGH CEILINGS
ARE PRETI'Y COOL.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.189
- LOTS OF SQUARE FOOTAGE.
- THIS FLOOR NEEDS TO COME UP--

06:16.300 --> 06:17.437
- YOU COULD FIT A LOT
OF KIDS IN HERE.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.405
- PAINT.
- YEP. IT'S GOT ELECTRICITY.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.990
- SEE? FOCUS ON THE--
FOCUS ON THE POTENTIAL.

06:22.100 --> 06:23.544
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
- IT'S GONNA REQUIRE SOME WORK.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.515
- THE BRAVERMAN ACADEMY.

06:25.620 --> 06:26.757
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE CAN'T CALL IT THAT.

06:26.860 --> 06:27.895
- WHY NOT?

06:28.000 --> 06:29.137
- IT'LL GO STRAIGHT
TO MAX'S HEAD.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.410
HE'LL TELL ALL THE OTHER KIDS
IT WAS NAMED AFI'ER HIM.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.589
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO?

06:31.700 --> 06:33.008
- WHAT?
- I WANT TO TAKE A PHOTO.

06:33.110 --> 06:33.963
COME ON.
- OKAY.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.149
- JUST RIGHT HERE?

06:35.250 --> 06:36.217
COME OVER HERE.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.309
I WANT TO STAND
NEXT TO MY HUSBAND.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.318
HERE. READY?
- OKAY.

06:39.430 --> 06:40.761
- GET TOGETHER.

06:40.880 --> 06:42.279
ON THE COUNT OF THREE.
READY?

06:44.360 --> 06:45.918
OKAY, I'M CLOSER.

06:46.020 --> 06:47.396
- TWO, THREE.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.910
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

06:50.030 --> 06:52.498
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

06:52.610 --> 06:54.646
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO

06:54.750 --> 06:56.308
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

06:56.410 --> 07:00.062
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER

07:00.170 --> 07:02.058
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

07:02.180 --> 07:03.169
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:03.280 --> 07:06.625
FOREVER YOUNG

07:06.730 --> 07:09.415

07:11.940 --> 07:13.976
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

07:14.080 --> 07:16.560
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

07:16.670 --> 07:18.319
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

07:18.430 --> 07:20.364
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

07:20.470 --> 07:22.324
AND MAY YOU STAY

07:22.440 --> 07:25.887
FOREVER YOUNG

07:25.990 --> 07:28.163
MAY YOU STAY

07:28.270 --> 07:31.990
FOREVER YOUNG

07:44.600 --> 07:46.522
- I KNOW IT LOOKS A LITTLE,
LIKE, DEPRESSING RIGHT NOW,

07:46.630 --> 07:47.380
BUT I FEEL LIKE
IF WE JUST PAINT IT,

07:47.500 --> 07:48.489
MAYBE, LIKE,
A BLUE OR SOMETHING.

07:48.600 --> 07:48.838
- I FINISHED MY ESSAY.
- LIKE A LIGHT BLUE.

07:48.950 --> 07:49.769
- GOOD JOB.

07:49.880 --> 07:50.209
- LET'S CHECK IT OUT.
- IT'S FINISHED.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.012
IT IS DONE.

07:51.120 --> 07:51.870
- IT'S A HALF A PAGE, MAX.

07:51.980 --> 07:52.537
- I MET ALL
THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.629
- YOU LIVE IN BERKELEY.

07:53.740 --> 07:54.229
YOU CAN'T TAKE A STAND
AGAINST RECYCLING

07:54.330 --> 07:55.433
AND DO JUST THE MINIMUM.

07:55.540 --> 07:56.222
YOU HAVE TO DO MORE THAN THAT.
- I JUST DID.

07:56.330 --> 07:57.080
I JUST DID THAT.
- KEEP WRITING.

07:57.200 --> 07:57.916
- AND I MADE VERY COMPELLING
ARGUMENTS.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.294
- WELL, LET ME
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.674
- SUCH AS THE FACT THAT
USING A REUSABLE WATER BOTTLE

08:00.790 --> 08:02.610
IS BETTER THAN RECYCLING A
BUNCH OF PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.926
- YES. THIS IIISI KRISTINA.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.339
I'M MICHELLE CHAMBERS,
GWEN'S SISTER.

08:06.450 --> 08:09.271
- OH, HEY.
HEY, MICHELLE. HOW ARE YOU?

08:09.380 --> 08:12.508
- WELL, I'M HERE.
STAYING WITH GWEN.

08:12.630 --> 08:14.439
SHE WANTED ME TO CALL YOU.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.107
YOU KNOW, SHE'S TALKED
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU,

08:16.210 --> 08:19.145
EVER SINCE YOU MET IN CHEMO.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.309
YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO HER.

08:21.430 --> 08:25.355
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
GWEN'S MY GIRL, SO...

08:25.470 --> 08:29.292
IS EVERYTHING--IS SHE--
I MEAN, WHAT--

08:29.400 --> 08:31.914
- KRISTINA,

08:32.020 --> 08:33.578
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO COME SEE HER.

08:37.510 --> 08:38.613
- OKAY.

08:39.790 --> 08:43.374
- SHOULD I TRY TO MAKE DREW
SWEET AND SOUR HAM BALLS?

08:43.480 --> 08:46.131
GROSS.
- NO. MAKE HIM THIS.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.719
SALMON PASTA BAKE.

08:47.830 --> 08:48.933
IT'S TOTAL BRAIN FOOD.

08:49.040 --> 08:52.077
IT'S TOMATOES AND BROCCOLI,
ANTIOXIDANTS.

08:52.180 --> 08:53.317
- SOUNDS LIKE A LOT
OF INGREDIENTS.

08:53.420 --> 08:55.524
WHAT ABOUT HARVEST STEW?

08:55.630 --> 08:56.949
DOESN'T THAT SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING

08:57.050 --> 08:57.869
MARTHA STEWART WOULD MAKE,
LIKE--

08:57.980 --> 09:00.392
- I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.
- WHAT?

09:00.500 --> 09:01.467
WHAT?

09:01.570 --> 09:02.320
- I SLEPT WITH SOMEONE.

09:02.430 --> 09:05.888
- SHUT UP.

09:05.990 --> 09:06.365
- EVAN KNIGHT.

09:06.470 --> 09:08.461
- WHO?

09:08.580 --> 09:09.569
- THE TEACHER.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.647
HE WAS AT THE RECORD
RELEASE PARTY.

09:10.750 --> 09:11.409
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH.

09:11.510 --> 09:14.752
- THIS IS BLOWING MY MIND.

09:14.860 --> 09:15.929
WITH THE GLASSES
AND THE THING?

09:16.030 --> 09:17.019
- YES.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.277
IT WAS A COMPLETELY JUST
IN THE MOMENT THING,

09:18.380 --> 09:19.893
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- AND I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.206
- NOT AT THE PARTY?
- I WAS TALKING TO HIM.

09:21.310 --> 09:22.481
WELL, I WAS TALKING TO HIM
AT THE PARTY,

09:22.590 --> 09:23.488
AND WE HAD THIS INSTANT,

09:23.590 --> 09:24.659
AND I JUST FELT SOMETHING

09:24.770 --> 09:25.862
THAT I'VE NOT FELT
IN A LONG TIME

09:25.970 --> 09:26.527
FOR ANYBODY OTHER THAN JOEL.

09:26.630 --> 09:28.837
AND I JUST WANTED TO--

09:28.940 --> 09:30.453
- AND YOU DID.
- AND I DID.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.379
- LOOK AT YOU.

09:32.500 --> 09:33.979
- AND I FEEL REALLY BAD
ABOUT IT NOW.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.398
- DON'T FEEL BAD.
- BUT IT'S NOT--

09:35.500 --> 09:37.354
- YOU'RE IN A VERY WEIRD TIME.

09:37.470 --> 09:38.562
YOU NEVER DO STUFF
LIKE THIS.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.430
- OH, MY GOD, BUT SARAH,
THIS IS NOT WHAT I DO.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.292
THIS IS NOT WHO I AM.
- IT'S OKAY.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.951
- I CAN COUNT ON ONE HAND
THE GUYS THAT I HAVE SLEPT WITH.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.164
- ONE HAND?
- YOU KNEW THIS. COME ON.

09:48.270 --> 09:49.714
HIGH SCHOOL, GARY GLASMAN.

09:49.830 --> 09:52.025

- OH, MY GOD.

09:52.140 --> 09:52.447
- JOEL.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.438
EVAN KNIGHT.

09:54.550 --> 09:55.517
- IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU ADDED TO THE COUNT.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.554
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:57.660 --> 09:58.866
I'M IN LOVE WITH MY HUSBAND.
- I KNOW.

09:58.970 --> 10:02.792
- I'VE BEEN WORKING SO LONG
TO KIND OF MAKE SOMETHING

10:02.910 --> 10:04.457
HAPPEN THERE WITH US.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.561
AND HE'S JUST BEEN
SO UNAVAILABLE TO ME.

10:05.670 --> 10:07.558
AND I JUST--I NEEDED
TO DO SOMETHING.

10:07.670 --> 10:10.355
- JULIA,
IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE,

10:10.470 --> 10:12.609
AND IT IS OKAY,

10:12.710 --> 10:15.577
AND YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.886
DO YOU WANT TO
SEE HIM AGAIN?

10:16.990 --> 10:17.740
I MEAN, IS IT THAT KIND OF--

10:17.850 --> 10:19.715
- WELL, I HAVE TO SEE HIM AGAIN

10:19.820 --> 10:20.957
'CAUSE WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

10:21.060 --> 10:21.992
- ALL RIGHT.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.544
WELL, TELL HIM IT WAS
A ONE-NIGHT THING

10:23.650 --> 10:27.438
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

10:27.550 --> 10:29.962
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

10:30.070 --> 10:31.139
- YEAH. I THINK SO.
I MEAN, YEAH.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.549
- I WOULDN'T TELL
ADAM AND KRISTINA, THOUGH,

10:34.660 --> 10:36.173
BECAUSE--
- OH, MY GOD.

10:36.290 --> 10:39.384
- MAX, TEACHER, CROSBY THING.
- CROSBY?

10:39.500 --> 10:40.592
- IT'S THEIR FAULT.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.634
THEY SHOULD NOT HIRE
SUCH ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE.

10:42.740 --> 10:43.638
OKAY?

10:43.740 --> 10:46.254
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
- OH, NO.

10:46.360 --> 10:47.395
- IT'S OKAY.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.539
- I MEAN, I TOLD HIM
SO MANY TIMES WHEN HE MOVED IN,

10:51.650 --> 10:53.026
"REPLACE IT. GO TANKLESS."

10:53.130 --> 10:54.927
BUT DOES HE LISTEN?
NO.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.748
NOT UNTIL
HIS FLOORBOARDS ARE ROTTING.

10:56.860 --> 10:59.408
I MEAN, I'M MORE THAN
A LITTLE BUSY HERE.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.021
- YEAH, YOU ARE.
DID HE JUST COME OUT

11:01.140 --> 11:02.721
AND ASK YOILIJOOUTRIGHT?

11:02.830 --> 11:04.138
HE'S DEFINITELY FISHING,
THOUGH,

11:04.240 --> 11:05.582
LIKE, WITH A TRAWLER.

11:05.690 --> 11:06.554
- YEAH. THAT'S TACKY.

11:06.660 --> 11:08.628
- YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S A PATTERN.

11:08.730 --> 11:11.904
HE KNOWS I'M FAMILY,
AND IF HE KEEPS PUSHING,

11:12.010 --> 11:14.069
EVENTUALLY I'LL JUST
CAVE AND DO IT.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.259
SO...

11:15.360 --> 11:16.634
- JOEL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET YOUR TOOLBOX

11:16.740 --> 11:18.469
AND HEAD OVER THERE?

11:18.570 --> 11:19.662
- WHAT? WHY?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.941
- BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO
DO IT EVENTUALLY.

11:22.060 --> 11:23.539
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
GET IT OVER AND DONE WITH.

11:23.640 --> 11:24.811
- AH.
YEAH.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.127
'CAUSE I'LL FEEL
GUILTY OTHERWISE?

11:27.230 --> 11:28.026
- NO.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.540
BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAMILY MAN.

11:29.650 --> 11:32.949
'CAUSE IT'S WHAT
MATTERS TO YOU.

11:33.070 --> 11:34.640
IT'S PROBABLY WHY
YOU HAVEN'T RESPONDED TO ME.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.684
GOD KNOWS I'VE GIVEN YOU
ENOUGH SIGNALS.

11:41.350 --> 11:42.556
OKAY. THAT GOT REAL.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.719
LET'S GO BACK TO WORK, YEAH?

12:38.370 --> 12:39.712
- DON'T NOTHING ME.
- IT'S A LONG STORY, MOM.

12:39.820 --> 12:40.855
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.303

IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
I WAS WONDERING

13:26.840 --> 13:29.661
IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS
ABOUT...

13:29.770 --> 13:33.831
THE OTHER DAY,
I KIND OF...

13:33.950 --> 13:36.089
KIND OF OPENED THE VAULT.

13:36.190 --> 13:36.702
ALL THE FEELINGS CAME OUT.

13:36.810 --> 13:39.324

TALK ABOUT IT NOW?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.857
- NO. I GET IT.
- THERE'S KIDS GOING BY.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.518

- YOU GOT WORK.

13:51.620 --> 13:52.894
- I MEAN, YEAH, I KNOW.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.581
IT'S LIKE AN EGG, RIGHT?
LIKE WHEN YOU BOIL AN EGG.

13:54.690 --> 13:56.237
YOU CAN'T--

13:56.350 --> 13:58.443
IT'S NOT GONNA GO ANY FASTER
IF YOU LOOK AT IT.

I'M GOING WITH THAT.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.528

READY FOR YOU NOW.

- OKAY.
- OKAY.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.628
HEY.

14:36.730 --> 14:39.858
YOUR SISTER SAID THAT
YOU COULD USE SOME COMPANY,

14:39.980 --> 14:43.837
AND I KNOW THAT I COULD
SURE USE SOME GIRL TIME,

14:43.950 --> 14:47.602
SO I THOUGHT
I'D STOP BY AND SAY HI.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.602
I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.608

TO LOOK AT PROPERTIES,

15:01.830 --> 15:06.176
AND WE ACTUALLY,
WE FOUND ONE, WHICH IS--

15:25.370 --> 15:26.883
SOME T.L.C.

15:26.990 --> 15:29.845
BUT I THINK
IT'S VERY PROMISING.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.780
IT HAS POTENTIAL,
FOR SURE.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.506

15:37.930 --> 15:39.818
I'M BLABBERING.

15:39.930 --> 15:41.898
I AM COMPLETELY BLABBERING.

15:42.010 --> 15:45.002
IF YOU WANT ME TO SHUT UP,
YOU CAN JUST--

15:45.110 --> 15:48.238
YOU CAN JUST SAY SO,
AND I'LL STOP TALKING.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.117
TRYING TO GIVE ME THE FINGER?

15:59.300 --> 16:01.746
I THINK THIS PLACE
IS GONNA BE REALLY GREAT,

16:01.850 --> 16:06.298
YOU KNOW,

16:06.410 --> 16:08.878
FOR MAX,
FOR SO MANY OTHER KIDS.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.163
IT'S JUST, UH...

16:12.280 --> 16:15.659
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT IT.

16:15.760 --> 16:19.457
THINK IT'LL BE SOMETHING
THAT CAN LIVE ON FOR--

16:33.880 --> 16:37.020
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

16:37.130 --> 16:41.055
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE DONE
ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.717
I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO.

16:51.870 --> 16:55.033
I LOVE YOU.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.822
- OKAY. SO I SPOKE TO
THE LISTING AGENT.

17:18.930 --> 17:19.919
- YEAH.
- THEY HAVE AN OFFER.

17:20.030 --> 17:20.962
- THEY DO?
- YEAH.

17:21.070 --> 17:23.447
- SERIOUS?
- A SERIOUS OFFER.

17:23.550 --> 17:24.892
CASH OFFER.
30-DAY CLOSE.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.309
IT'S THAT HUGE DEVELOPER,
DRIDER, SO...

17:27.420 --> 17:29.274
- WELL, WE CAN HOPE
MAYBE IT'LL FALL THROUGH.

17:29.390 --> 17:30.550
- DOESN'T MA'ITER.
WE'RE NOT TOO LATE.

17:30.670 --> 17:31.762
WE CAN GET IT.

17:31.870 --> 17:33.189
- OH.
- I KNOW WE CAN GET IT.

17:33.290 --> 17:36.282
- IT COULD FALL THROUGH,
BUT THIS IS A PRETTY--

17:36.400 --> 17:37.833
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
ACCEPT IT.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.019
- IF THE CITY OWNS IT,

17:39.120 --> 17:40.291
WE CAN LEASE IT BACK
FROM THE CITY.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.389
- RIGHT, BUT LOOK, HONEY,

17:41.500 --> 17:42.637
IF THE SALE
ENDS UP GOING THROUGH,

17:42.750 --> 17:44.263
WE'LL JUST FIND ANOTHER PLACE.
- I KNOW.

17:44.370 --> 17:45.814
BUT THEY HAVEN'T BOUGHT IT YET.
SO THE CITY OWNS IT.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.603
WE CAN LEASE IT FROM THE CITY.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.233
- WE ABSOLUTELY COULD
IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS BUYER.

17:49.340 --> 17:50.819
- BUT THEY HAVEN'T--

17:50.930 --> 17:52.989
THAT'S MOMMY'S BUILDING.
WE'RE GONNA GET THAT BUILDING.

17:53.100 --> 17:53.850
- ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.848
- WE'RE GONNA GET THAT BUILDING.

17:55.970 --> 17:58.825
- NOW?
- MM-HMM.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.762
- AH. COME ON.

18:06.870 --> 18:09.430
OH. OKAY.
I HOPE THAT'S RIGHT.

18:09.530 --> 18:09.871
[knocking]

18:09.980 --> 18:10.947
YEAH?

18:14.990 --> 18:16.434
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
STOP. STOP.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.394
- I'M REMOVING THE SUBFLOOR.
- YEAH. DON'T--NO--

18:18.510 --> 18:20.057
LET ME JUST--WATCHING YOU
HOLD THE SAW LIKE THAT

18:20.160 --> 18:22.333
OFFENDS ME.
JUST LET ME, UH...

18:22.440 --> 18:25.785
SEE WHAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH.
- OKAY. I'M BACKING AWAY.

18:25.890 --> 18:26.754
- WHAT DO YOU GOT
GOING ON HERE?

18:26.860 --> 18:28.339
- THAT'S THE SUBFLOOR. I'M...

18:28.450 --> 18:29.371
- YEAH.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.448
YEAH, WE DON'T NEED
TO CUT THAT ANYMORE.

18:31.550 --> 18:33.791
I'M JUST GONNA...
- YEP. YEP.

18:33.900 --> 18:34.650
IS THAT NOT RIGHT?
- NO.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.034
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
REINFORCE THAT.

18:36.140 --> 18:37.311
I'M PRETTY SURE.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.661
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE?

18:39.770 --> 18:41.214
- YEAH. YOU KNOW,
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US...

18:41.320 --> 18:42.457
- YOU POSITIVE?

18:42.560 --> 18:42.878
IN A COUPLE DAYS--YEAH, BUDDY.
- YOU SWEAR?

18:42.980 --> 18:44.049
- I SWEAR.

18:44.150 --> 18:45.947
- JOEL,
I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH.

18:46.050 --> 18:49.770
I'M IN SO, SO OVER MY HEAD.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.814
I REALLY--THIS IS--THANK YOU.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.297
I OWE YOU SO BIG-TIME.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.981
YOU EVER WANT TO RECORD
AN ALBUM,

18:56.100 --> 18:57.089
YOU COME SEE ME.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.610
IT'S ON THE HOUSE.
- FINALLY.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.926
- I'M YOUR GUY.
- YOU'RE MY MAN.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.065
GOOD TO KNOW.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.137
ALL RIGHT.
HAND ME THAT CROWBAR.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.025
WE'LL SEE HOW FAR
THIS ROT GOES.

19:03.140 --> 19:04.710
- OKAY.

19:04.830 --> 19:08.618
YOU SHOULD KNOW I'VE ALREADY
CUT A FEW OF THESE, THOUGH.

19:08.730 --> 19:09.936
YEAH.
- OH. OH.

19:10.040 --> 19:12.691
[knocking]

19:12.800 --> 19:13.937
- JULIA.
- HEY.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.177
- HI.
- HI, EVAN.

19:15.290 --> 19:17.349
- THIS IS SPONTANEOUS.
I LIKE IT.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.007
- OH, YEAH.
OKAY.

19:19.120 --> 19:22.180
UM, I REALLY JUST
WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

19:22.290 --> 19:23.564
- OKAY.
- YEAH.

19:23.670 --> 19:24.534
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME INSIDE?

19:24.640 --> 19:25.914
- NO. THAT'S GOOD.
- OKAY.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.814
- SO THE OTHER NIGHT...

19:30.920 --> 19:32.091
- THE OTHER NIGHT.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.475
- WAS, UM, NICE.

19:34.580 --> 19:35.569
- NICE?

19:35.690 --> 19:38.158
- BUT, CLEARLY,
I GOT AHEAD OF MYSELF.

19:38.280 --> 19:39.406
- OKAY.

19:39.520 --> 19:43.866
- SO EVEN THOUGH
WE HAD A--IT WAS--

19:43.970 --> 19:46.313
- NICE.

19:49.150 --> 19:53.359
- WE JUST CAN'T DO IT--
THAT...AGAIN.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.497
I'M GOING THROUGH...

19:56.600 --> 19:57.976
A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME
WITH MY MARRIAGE.

19:58.090 --> 20:00.945
- IT'S OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.

20:01.060 --> 20:02.049
I DO.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.434
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL LIKE

20:03.540 --> 20:06.361
I WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.265
- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME?

20:07.370 --> 20:09.850
THAT'S NOT--COME ON.
- YEAH.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.336
- THAT'S NOT WHAT--NO.

20:11.450 --> 20:14.089
JULIA,
YOU ARE AN AMAZING,

20:14.210 --> 20:17.247
BEAUTIFUL,
INCREDIBLY SEXY WOMAN.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.818
OKAY? YOU WERE NOT TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF ME.

20:19.940 --> 20:21.100
WE WERE--WE WERE JUST--
WE WERE HAVING FUN.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.667
THAT'S ALL.

20:24.770 --> 20:25.350
- YEAH.

20:25.460 --> 20:28.497
WE--YEAH.
WE HAD FUN. OKAY.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.920
I WASN'T JUST HAVING FUN.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.808
I REALLY NEEDED
TO BREAK FREE.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.091
SO I'M GLAD I GOT TO
BREAK FREE WITH YOU.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.020
- ME TOO.

20:47.590 --> 20:49.239
- GOOD.
- GOOD.

20:51.590 --> 20:53.273
- CAN YOU NOT TELL
ADAM AND KRISTINA?

20:53.390 --> 20:54.550
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.070
- OKAY, THANK YOU.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

20:56.180 --> 20:57.488
- I THINK
THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.977
- YEAH. MIGHT BE STRANGE.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.627
GOOD.
- SO, WE'RE GOOD.

21:01.740 --> 21:02.001
- WE'RE GOOD.
- OKAY. WE'RE GOOD.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.499
- OKAY.

21:05.600 --> 21:08.489
THANK YOU.
THAT WAS--

21:08.610 --> 21:10.259
I'LL...I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.053
- YEP.
- OKAY.

21:18.960 --> 21:21.997
- HEY.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.204
- SHE'S GONE.

21:24.310 --> 21:29.384
- OH, KRISTINA.
I'M SORRY.

21:29.490 --> 21:32.038
- I...I DON'T KNOW.

21:32.150 --> 21:35.426
I MEAN, I JUST--THE LAST
CONVERSATION I HAD WITH HER,

21:35.530 --> 21:36.428
JUST I GUESS...

21:36.530 --> 21:38.669
WHEN I WENT TO SEE HER,
YOU KNOW,

21:38.780 --> 21:41.533
IT WASN'T REALLY
A CONVERSATION BECAUSE

21:41.640 --> 21:45.747
I WAS RAMBLING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

21:45.850 --> 21:48.535
ABOUT MY LIFE, ABOUT YOU,
ABOUT THE KIDS,

21:48.650 --> 21:51.574
ABOUT JUST EVERYTHING,
YOU KNOW.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.853
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF SHE COULD HEAR ME.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.894
JUST...

21:56.000 --> 21:57.308
WAS SHE SCARED?

21:57.410 --> 22:00.413
YOU KNOW.
DID SHE FEEL ALONE?

22:02.560 --> 22:05.415
AND I'M STILL HERE,
YOU KNOW?

22:05.530 --> 22:06.838
I'M ALLOWED
TO HOLD THE KIDS.

22:06.940 --> 22:08.100
I'M ALLOWED TO BE A MOM.

22:08.220 --> 22:09.528
I'M ALLOWED TO BE A WIFE.

22:09.630 --> 22:11.211
AND I CAN BE A FRIEND
AND A SISTER AND A DAUGHTER.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.116
BUT SHE'S NOT.

22:13.220 --> 22:15.188
WHY DO I GET TO BE HERE?

22:15.290 --> 22:17.360
WHY DO I GET TO BE
LUCKY AND SHE DOESN'T?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.607
- YOU CAN'T ASK THAT.

22:18.710 --> 22:20.154
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.
- IT'S NOT RIGHT.

22:20.260 --> 22:21.466
- AND I'M MAD.
- THAT'S OKAY.

22:21.580 --> 22:22.979
- I'M MAD.
- IT'S OKAY.

22:23.100 --> 22:23.668
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN BE MAD.

22:23.790 --> 22:25.849
YOU CAN BE ANGRY.
IT'S OKAY.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.849
IT'S NOT FAIR.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.895
[melancholy guitar,
soft singing]

22:44.050 --> 22:45.449
- IT WAS JUST REALLY SWEET.

22:45.570 --> 22:48.118
HE WAS REALLY EXPRESSIVE,

22:48.220 --> 22:50.188
WHICH IS HARD FOR HIM.

22:50.290 --> 22:53.293
YOU KNOW,
HE HAD CLEARLY THOUGHT ABOUT

22:53.400 --> 22:55.777
EVERYTHING HE'D BEEN FEELING,

22:55.890 --> 22:58.336
AND HE REALLY
PUT IT OUT THERE.

22:58.440 --> 23:04.788
HE'S SORT OF WAITING
FOR MY RESPONSE, I GUESS.

23:04.900 --> 23:05.685
- HUH.

23:05.790 --> 23:07.473
- AND, I MEAN,
HE'S BEEN IN THERAPY.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.488
AND YOU CAN TELL.

23:08.590 --> 23:09.614
I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL

23:09.730 --> 23:12.039
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEE
THE WHEELS TURNING.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.176
YOU CAN SEE HE'S REALLY BEEN
WORKING ON CERTAIN THINGS.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.554
YOU KNOW?
- MM-HMM.

23:15.670 --> 23:16.796
- BUT IT'S SWEET.

23:16.910 --> 23:18.218
AND WE'VE HAD A GREAT TIME
THIS YEAR,

23:18.320 --> 23:19.764
FOR THE MOST PART,
WORKING TOGETHER.

23:19.880 --> 23:21.188
- THAT SHOV_\|/_(S)COMMITMENT

23:21.290 --> 23:23.702
TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK,
RIGHT?

23:23.810 --> 23:24.606
- YEAH.

23:24.710 --> 23:26.086
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
- YEAH.

23:26.190 --> 23:27.179
- MM-HMM.

23:27.300 --> 23:28.779
- WELL, HOW DO YOU
FEEL ABOUT HIM?

23:28.890 --> 23:30.676
- I DON'T KNOW ALL THE TIME.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.601
I HAVEN'T REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

23:33.720 --> 23:35.119
TO BE INTIMATE AGAIN
WITH HIM.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.923
- MM-HMM.

23:37.030 --> 23:38.304
- AND...

23:38.410 --> 23:40.753
I'M NOT SURE
WHY THAT IS.

23:40.860 --> 23:44.170
IF THERE'S A WALL THERE
BECAUSE--

23:44.280 --> 23:46.999
- YOU'RE WORRIED 'CAUSE
HE MIGHT BE ON THE SPECTRUM.

23:47.110 --> 23:48.338
- YEAH.

23:48.460 --> 23:51.975
BECAUSE I CAN FEEL IT
SOMETIMES.

23:52.080 --> 23:56.528
IT'S LIKE ANOTHER PERSON
WITH US, YOU KNOW.

23:56.640 --> 23:59.803
BUT SOMETIMES
I FORGET ABOUT IT AND...

23:59.920 --> 24:02.184
- LOOK, SARAH.
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU

24:02.300 --> 24:03.779
THAT THE GUY CAN LOVE YOU

24:03.890 --> 24:05.539
THE WAY THAT YOU WANT
TO BE LOVED,

24:05.650 --> 24:07.436
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ROOT
FOR HIM.

24:07.540 --> 24:10.259
WHEN HE'S WITH MAX,
HE'S REAL PRESENT,

24:10.370 --> 24:12.952
AND HE CARES ABOUT HIM.

24:13.070 --> 24:16.824
HE REALLY DOES.

24:16.930 --> 24:18.488
I'VE GOT TO HOPE THAT
HE'S CAPABLE

24:18.590 --> 24:19.579
OF HAVING A RELATIONSHIP,

24:19.690 --> 24:22.625
THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY
FOR HANK.

24:22.730 --> 24:25.039
'CAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO THINK
THAT THERE COULD BE

24:25.150 --> 24:25.354
SOMEBODY FOR MAX.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.428
- YEAH.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.634
ME TOO.
- SO...

24:29.740 --> 24:31.776
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU KNOW.
YOU COULD DO A LOT WORSE.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.188
- I'VE DONE A LOT WORSE.
LET'S FACE IT.

24:33.290 --> 24:34.222
- WELL, I DIDN'T
WANT TO SAY THAT.

24:34.330 --> 24:35.251
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE.
- [snickers]

24:39.610 --> 24:41.407
[door opens]

24:41.510 --> 24:43.159
- HELLO.

24:43.270 --> 24:44.783
- HEY.

24:44.890 --> 24:46.448
- HE'S HERE,
NICE AND RELAXED TODAY.

24:46.550 --> 24:48.757
- ALL RIGHT.
WE LIKE HIM THAT WAY.

24:48.860 --> 24:49.758
[telephone rings]
- YEAH. OKAY.

24:49.860 --> 24:50.724
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS
LATER, OKAY?

24:50.830 --> 24:52.684
- ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

24:52.800 --> 24:53.789
- HELLO?

24:53.900 --> 24:56.039
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?
THE LONG EXPOSURES, MAX?

24:56.140 --> 24:58.028
- I TOOK PHOTOS OF CARS
COMING DOWN MY STREET

24:58.150 --> 25:00.141
FROM ALL OF THE FRONT-FACING
WINDOWS OF MY HOUSE.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.319
- NICE.

25:01.430 --> 25:03.876
- MY LONGEST EXPOSURE
WAS 23 SECONDS.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.356
- I'M PAYING THE BILLS
OVER HERE.

25:05.460 --> 25:07.155
YOU WANTNI-CCJ) SWITCH?

25:07.260 --> 25:08.841
THAT SOUNDS UNPLEASANT.

25:08.950 --> 25:11.601
- I CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS.
COME ON.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.192
- AMBER IS SITTING ON
THE PAVEMENT

25:16.300 --> 25:18.609
OUTSIDE OF YOUR STORE.

25:18.720 --> 25:19.948
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:23.310 --> 25:23.969
YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

25:24.070 --> 25:26.538
WHAT DID YOU DO?
DID YOU FALL DOWN?

25:26.660 --> 25:27.615
YOU WANT TO COME INSIDE
FOR A SECOND?

25:27.730 --> 25:28.480
- I HAVE TO GO.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:28.590 --> 25:31.206
- I HAVE TO GO.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

25:31.320 --> 25:32.275
- THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT AT--

25:32.390 --> 25:34.415
- WITH WHO?

25:34.530 --> 25:36.350
- RYAN WAS IN AN ACCIDENT,
AND I HAVE TO GO.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.802
- IS HE OKAY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:37.910 --> 25:39.559
I HAVE TO GO.
- WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

25:41.470 --> 25:42.732
- WELL, NOW, YOU CAN'T GO
TO SAN DIEGO--

25:42.850 --> 25:44.636
- I HAVE TO GO, HANK!
- LET ME CALL YOUR MOTHER.

25:44.750 --> 25:45.774
WHY DON'T I CALL
YOUR MOTHER AND--

25:45.880 --> 25:47.290
- I HAVE TO GO NOW!
- YOU CAN'T DRIVE LIKE--

25:47.400 --> 25:49.982
- I DON'T HAVE TIME, HANK.
- JUST FOR ONE SECOND,

25:50.100 --> 25:53.126
TAKE A BREATH FOR A SECOND.
- HANK, I DO NOT HAVE ANY TIME!

25:55.170 --> 25:56.956
- I CAN DRIVE YOU.
YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE YOU?

25:57.070 --> 25:58.094
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DRIVE ME.

25:58.210 --> 25:58.926
I JUST HAVE TO GO.
- I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.541
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
GET OVER THERE.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.753
I'M GONNA CLOSE UP.
MAX!

26:04.940 --> 26:08.034
- THIS IS, UH...
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.732
YOU KNOW,
YOU COMING TO SEE ME.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.525
- IT'S INTERESTING.
WELL, I BELIEVE THAT,

26:13.640 --> 26:15.972
YOU KNOW, THIS SCHOOL
CAN BE VERY INTERESTING.

26:16.090 --> 26:18.877
IT'S A--YOU KNOW,
IT'S A PASSION PROJECT FOR US,

26:18.990 --> 26:21.390
AND I THINK IT'LL HELP
A LOT OF KIDS AND FAMILIES.

26:21.510 --> 26:22.909
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

26:23.020 --> 26:25.602
I REALLY DO.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.780
- YOU REALIZE THAT
DRIDER PROPERTY AND THIS CITY

26:28.890 --> 26:30.164
DO A TON OF BUSINESS TOGETHER.

26:30.270 --> 26:31.441
THEY ARE A HUGE GENERATING
REVENUE SOURCE FOR US.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.689
- YES.
- THEY FUND A TON OF PROJECTS.

26:33.790 --> 26:35.610
- I GET IT, BOB.
I UNDERSTAND.

26:35.730 --> 26:37.379
MR. DRIDER
IS A GREAT DEVELOPER.

26:37.490 --> 26:38.479
HE'S A GREAT CONTRACTOR.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.103
HE TAKES OLD
HISTORIC BUILDINGS.

26:40.210 --> 26:42.178
HE KNOCKS THEM DOWN,
AND HE PUTS A PIZZA HUT

26:42.290 --> 26:44.520
AND TACO BELL AND PIZZA TACO
BELL CHICKEN WING.

26:44.630 --> 26:45.733
WHATEVER IT IS--
- KRISTINA.

26:45.840 --> 26:48.252
- WHICH I HAPPEN TO LOVE
AND FREQUENT, I DO.

26:48.360 --> 26:50.043
BUT THIS BUILDING,

26:50.160 --> 26:51.730
I THINK IT'S GONNA HELP
SO MANY PEOPLE.

26:51.850 --> 26:53.010
- SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

26:53.120 --> 26:54.496
YOU WANT ME TO LEASE THIS
TO YOU BECAUSE--

26:54.610 --> 26:55.747
- YES. I DO.

26:55.850 --> 26:57.158
I WANT YOU TO LEASE IT TO ME.

26:57.270 --> 26:58.817
I WANT YOU TO LEASE IT
TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE--

26:58.920 --> 27:00.262
- BECAUSE
IT HAS A HIGHER PURPOSE?

27:00.370 --> 27:01.610
KRISTINA, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO BITE ON.

27:01.720 --> 27:02.687
- MAYBE. IT DOES.

27:02.790 --> 27:03.779
IT HAS A HIGHER PURPOSE,
BOB.

27:03.890 --> 27:04.754
IT HAS A HIGHER PURPOSE.

27:04.860 --> 27:06.134
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:06.240 --> 27:07.207
BY HELPING US,

27:07.310 --> 27:08.891
YOU'RE GONNA HELP YOURSELF
LOOK GOOD.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.547
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK
REALLY GOOD.

27:10.660 --> 27:12.582
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LIKE TO LOOK GOOD.

27:12.700 --> 27:15.908
SO, BOB, THIS IS A WIN-WIN
FOR BOTH OF US,

27:16.010 --> 27:18.626
I THINK.

27:18.740 --> 27:22.324
- I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES,
KRISTINA,

27:22.430 --> 27:25.843
BECAUSE THE WHEELS ARE
ALREADY IN MOTION ON THIS.

27:25.950 --> 27:27.531
BUT I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.915
- YOU'LL LOOK INTO IT?

27:30.020 --> 27:31.669
- KRISTINA, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY TO YOU?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.509
- NOTHING. THAT'S PER--
THAT'S GREAT.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.123
THANK YOU.
- KRISTINA.

27:35.230 --> 27:36.231
- NO, IT'S GOOD.

27:36.340 --> 27:37.921
- WELL, I'M TELLING YOU
I WILL LOOK--

27:38.030 --> 27:39.850
- ONE THING, BOB.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.099
DON'T DO THIS FOR ME.
DON'T DO THIS FOR YOU.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.586
JUST DO IT BECAUSE MAYBE
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

27:43.690 --> 27:46.966
IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.

27:50.460 --> 27:54.874
- STILL PROTECTING
THE MAGIC FEATHER

27:54.980 --> 27:58.108
HOLD TIGHT
TO YOUR SUPPORTING CRUTCH

27:58.220 --> 28:01.189
WRITING SCRIPTS
ON WORN OUT LEATHER

28:01.300 --> 28:04.258
STILL WAITING
ON A DIVINE TOUCH

28:04.370 --> 28:07.430
TRY TO RIDE ON WAVES
OF ACTIVITY

28:07.540 --> 28:10.122
IN EVERY DIRECTION

28:14.030 --> 28:16.339
IN EVERY DIRECTION

28:19.490 --> 28:21.890
IN EVERY DIRECTION

28:26.040 --> 28:27.667
- SURGERY?
FOR WHAT?

28:27.770 --> 28:29.977
- THE DOCTOR HAS TO TALK
TO YOU DIRECTLY.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.388
- BUT I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
IS HE--I MEAN,

28:31.500 --> 28:32.421
IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?

28:32.530 --> 28:33.906
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY INFORMATION.

28:34.020 --> 28:35.601
- YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT
TILL HE COMES OUT OF THE O.R.

28:35.710 --> 28:37.018
I'M SO SORRY.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.190
- SO THERE'S NOTHING THAT
YOU CAN TELL ME AT ALL?

28:39.300 --> 28:40.699
- NOT AT THIS TIME.

28:40.820 --> 28:44.165
- SO, UM...
WE'LL JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE?

28:44.270 --> 28:46.431
- JUST HAVE A SEAT.
- WE'LL WAIT RIGHT HERE.

28:50.410 --> 28:52.753
I THINK IF IT WOULD
HAVE BEEN SERIOUS,

28:52.860 --> 28:55.033
THEN THEY HAVE TO
TELL YOU, YOU KNOW.

28:55.140 --> 28:57.722
- THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

29:00.870 --> 29:01.837
- HANK, YOU KNOW,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.875
- NO. I'M GONNA STAY.
I'M GONNA STAY.

29:27.350 --> 29:28.510
[knock on door]

29:28.620 --> 29:31.316
- IS YOUR MOM HERE?

29:31.420 --> 29:31.863
- HA HA.

29:31.970 --> 29:35.007
NO, SHE'S NOT HERE.

29:35.110 --> 29:37.169
- ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO THIS.

29:37.290 --> 29:38.496
YOU ASKED WHY
I SLEPT WITH BERTO.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.182
- I DIDN'T EVEN ASK THAT.
- I WAS PISSED AT YOU, OKAY?

29:41.290 --> 29:42.279
- SO YOU WENT
AND SLEPT WITH BERTO.

29:42.400 --> 29:43.492
- JUST PLEASE LET ME
GET THIS OUT.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.771
- IT STILL DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

29:44.880 --> 29:47.599
- LOOK.
I KNOW OUR ENTIRE THING WAS...

29:47.710 --> 29:49.951
LOOSE OR WHATEVER.

29:50.060 --> 29:51.743
AND FINE.
I TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.260
IT WAS MY IDEA.
- YEAH.

29:53.370 --> 29:56.544
- BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
I DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

29:56.650 --> 29:57.503
AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

29:57.620 --> 29:59.133
AMY COMES TO TOWN,

29:59.240 --> 30:00.616
AND YOU GUYS HAVE
ALL THIS HISTORY.

30:00.720 --> 30:04.178
AND SHE'S SO
INTIMIDATINGLY BEAUTIFUL,

30:04.280 --> 30:05.895
AND SHE'S SMART,
AND SHE'S SWEET.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.454
AND SHE, LIKE,
MOVES IN HERE WITH YOU.

30:07.560 --> 30:09.209
AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE MARRIED
FOR A MONTH

30:09.320 --> 30:12.733
AND I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU,
AND YOU DISAPPEAR, AND...

30:12.840 --> 30:17.015
AND I GUESS
I JUST FELT FORGOTTEN.

30:19.570 --> 30:20.537
SO I WAS PISSED,

30:20.640 --> 30:23.393
AND I WENT AND I SLEPT
WITH YOUR STUPID ROOMMATE.

30:25.960 --> 30:29.714
BUT IT WASN'T ABOUT BERTO.

30:29.820 --> 30:32.948
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT YOU.

30:33.070 --> 30:36.164
AND TRUST ME,
I REALLY WISH I HADN'T DONE IT.

30:38.730 --> 30:41.176
- OKAY.

30:44.350 --> 30:45.738
- OKAY?

30:45.840 --> 30:48.047
- YEAH.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.227
- WELL, IT'S FINALS
PRIMAL SCREAM TONIGHT,

30:55.330 --> 30:57.366
IF YOU WANT TO
COME YELL AT ME.

30:57.470 --> 31:00.576
- UM...I WASN'T GONNA
GO TO THAT, BUT--

31:00.680 --> 31:03.126
- SUIT YOURSELF.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.509
- SO THEY'RE OUT OF THERE.
- THEY'RE SELLING THE HOUSE.

31:15.630 --> 31:16.836
- YEAH. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

31:16.940 --> 31:18.726
- ZEEK BRAVERMAN
IS SELLING HIS HOUSE?

31:18.840 --> 31:20.171
- YEAH.

31:20.290 --> 31:20.597
IT'S LIKE THE FORESHADOWING
OF THE APOCALYPSE.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.941
- YEAH.

31:23.050 --> 31:25.632
- RAINING FROGS OR THE CUBS
WINNING THE WORLD SERIES.

31:25.740 --> 31:27.048
IT'S SCARY.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.730
- HOW IS, UH...

31:28.850 --> 31:31.569
HOW'S JULIA DOING
WITH THAT?

31:35.340 --> 31:38.127
- WELL, SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S PRETTY DARN BUSY.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.504
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW
THAT ADAM AND KRISTINA

31:40.620 --> 31:41.928
ARE STARTING THIS CHARTER
SCHOOL, AND SHE'S BEEN

31:42.030 --> 31:43.713
WORKING ON THAT WITH THEM, SO...
- YEAH. YEAH.

31:43.830 --> 31:45.343
SHE MENTIONED SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT.

31:45.450 --> 31:47.486
- THINK SHE'S BEEN DISTRACTED
PROBABLY WITH THAT.

31:47.590 --> 31:49.205
- ADAM AND KRISTINA
STARTING A SCHOOL--

31:49.320 --> 31:50.821
I GUESS THAT WAS BOUND
TO HAPPEN, RIGHT?

31:50.940 --> 31:52.794
- UGH. YOU KNOW,

31:52.910 --> 31:54.969
THEY'RE SO OBNOXIOUSLY GOOD,
THOSE TWO.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.934
IT'S SO IN YOUR FACE.
- IT'S JUST THE WORST.

31:57.050 --> 31:58.039
- WE'RE STARTING A SCHOOL.
- IT'S DISGUSTING.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.597
- TRYING TO BE'ITER THE CITY
AND NOW THIS.

32:01.710 --> 32:03.154
- THAT'S A GOOD FLOOR, MAN.

32:03.260 --> 32:04.295
- YEAH?

32:04.400 --> 32:05.844
I WOULD NOT HAVE
THAT GOOD FLOOR WITHOUT YOU,

32:05.950 --> 32:08.646
SO...IT'S ALSO
SPORE-FREE IN THERE.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.739
- THERE YOU GO.
- YEAH.

32:09.850 --> 32:12.569
FEEL FREE TO TAKE DEEP,
DEEP BREATHS.

32:12.680 --> 32:13.999
- THIS IS A GREAT HOUSE,
MAN.

32:14.100 --> 32:17.968
I'M SO GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE HAPPY HERE.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.139
- YEAH. WE ARE.

32:19.240 --> 32:22.129
THIS HAS--
IT'S BEEN A GOOD PLACE.

32:26.940 --> 32:29.249
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

32:29.360 --> 32:31.874
- I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

32:31.980 --> 32:35.017
MAINTAINING. YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.293
- CHEERLEADING FOR THE KIDS.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.984
[sighs]
I DON'T KNOW.

32:41.090 --> 32:43.775
I FEEL LIKE
I'M IN THIS LIMBO OF SORTS.

32:43.890 --> 32:46.472
YOU KNOW,
I VISIT MY OLD LIFE,

32:46.580 --> 32:50.266
AND I GET THESE
LITTLE PIECES, BUT, UH...

32:50.380 --> 32:53.167
YEAH, I DON'T--
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT.

32:56.180 --> 33:01.004
- WELL, WE ALL MISS YOU
A TON, SO...

33:01.110 --> 33:02.691
- THAN KS, BUDDY.

33:05.840 --> 33:08.525
ALL RIGHT.

33:08.640 --> 33:10.528
TELL ME ABOUT THE BABY.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.153
- YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

33:12.260 --> 33:12.942
BABY GOT INTO STANFORD.

33:13.060 --> 33:15.199
- JEEZ.
- PRE-ENROLLED.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.460
THAT'S HOW ADVANCED SHE IS.

33:16.580 --> 33:19.572
ACTUALLY,
SHE'S NOT VERY ADVANCED.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.908
LOOK HOW INTO THIS STUPID,

33:21.030 --> 33:22.782
CHEAP LITTLE POODLE. ..

33:22.890 --> 33:27.065
[chatter, laughter]

33:31.350 --> 33:33.079
OH, HE'S SO GOOD
WITH HER, TOO.

33:33.180 --> 33:36.695
Crosby: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
[Jasmine giggling]

33:36.800 --> 33:39.667
[Crosby, indistinct]

33:39.770 --> 33:43.422
[crowd noise]

33:48.260 --> 33:51.570
- THE THINGS YOU DO FOR, LIKE,
THE HUNDRED--

33:51.680 --> 33:52.954
- HEY.
- HI.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.743
- OKAY.
SO MAYBE YOU WERE RIGHT.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.999
- I WAS RIGHT? NO!

33:57.100 --> 33:58.192
- OKAY, BUT I WAS MAD.

33:58.310 --> 34:00.062
MAYBE I NEED TO JUST
YELL ABOUT IT

34:00.170 --> 34:00.750
AND FEEL BE‘I‘I'ER.
[students counting down]

34:00.860 --> 34:01.758
- NOW! YELL!

34:01.860 --> 34:07.719
-AAH!

34:10.660 --> 34:11.797
- OH, GOSH.

34:11.910 --> 34:13.480
- [laughing]

34:13.600 --> 34:16.569
- I DON'T WANT TO JUST
BE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW.

34:16.670 --> 34:19.844
I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP AROUND
WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE.

34:19.950 --> 34:21.804
I WANT YOU
TO BE MY GIRLFRIEND.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.536
- YES.
- YEAH?

34:24.640 --> 34:25.743
- YES. ABSOLUTELY.

34:25.850 --> 34:27.078

35:10.030 --> 35:11.827

35:11.930 --> 35:12.851
OH.

35:19.250 --> 35:19.909
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

35:20.010 --> 35:21.978
- HOW WAS THE DRIVE?

35:22.080 --> 35:24.594
- YEAH. IT WAS OKAY.
NO BIG DEAL, I'M--

35:24.700 --> 35:27.009
- HANK,
IT'S A REALLY LONG DRIVE.

35:27.120 --> 35:27.905
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.
THANK YOU.

35:28.020 --> 35:30.079
- SHE WAS SCARED, YOU KNOW?

35:30.190 --> 35:32.329
SO, UH...
TRIED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT,

35:32.440 --> 35:34.908
AND THEN I JUST
KEPT DRIVING.

35:35.020 --> 35:36.840
BUT IT'S ALL OKAY.

35:36.960 --> 35:39.884
- HOW IS HE?

35:39.990 --> 35:41.378
- HE'S IN SURGERY.
- OH, MY GOD.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.472
- YEAH, BUT I THINK
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

35:44.590 --> 35:48.299
YEAH, SHE FELL ASLEEP
ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.933

I'M SORRY.

36:13.860 --> 36:15.543
[Amber sighing]

36:15.650 --> 36:18.403
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.426
- YEAH. YEAH.
NO, NO. SORRY.

36:37.540 --> 36:40.600
I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE SITE,
AND I JUST--

36:40.710 --> 36:43.463
I KNOW THE DISHWASHER'S
STILL QUITTING MID-CYCLE,

36:43.580 --> 36:46.572
SO I THOUGHT I'D SWING BY
AND GIVE IT A STAB.

36:46.680 --> 36:47.817
- OH, THANKS.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.295
I FIXED IT.

36:48.410 --> 36:50.753
I MEAN--
- OH.

36:50.860 --> 36:51.827
- YEAH, IT WAS...

36:51.930 --> 36:52.715
LEAKING ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

36:52.830 --> 36:54.479
I COULDN'T WAIT,
SO I CALLED A PLUMBER.

36:54.590 --> 36:55.443

37:07.010 --> 37:10.832

END OF AN ERA.

37:15.020 --> 37:16.157
- HOW YOU FEELING
ABOUT THAT?

37:16.260 --> 37:19.741
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT PLACE
MEANS A LOT TO YOU.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.927
- UH...

37:24.030 --> 37:26.954
I'M OKAY.

37:27.070 --> 37:30.301
I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT OF IT
AS PROPERTY, YOU KNOW.

37:30.420 --> 37:33.651
IT WAS JUST ALWAYS HOME,
SO IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.797
- YEAH.
- I MEAN, UNTIL THIS HOME.

37:36.900 --> 37:37.309
BUT, UM,

37:37.420 --> 37:40.173
I'M GLAD FOR THEM.

37:40.290 --> 37:43.077
THEY WANT TO MOVE ON, SO...

37:43.190 --> 37:47.354

37:49.430 --> 37:50.362

37:52.130 --> 37:54.155

37:54.270 --> 37:55.646
- OH, NO.
- I DON'T KNOW--

37:55.750 --> 37:57.092
- OH, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

37:57.200 --> 37:58.167
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
- NO, I KNOW.

37:58.270 --> 37:59.498
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL
OBLIGATED TO--

37:59.620 --> 38:00.473
- YEAH, AND I DON'T.

38:01.900 --> 38:03.299
HE'S A GROWN MAN.
- THAT'S DEBATABLE.

38:03.410 --> 38:04.160
BUT HE--YEAH, NO.

38:04.280 --> 38:07.864
I WAS HAPPY TO DO IT.

38:07.970 --> 38:08.038

LIVING AT ITS FINEST?

38:37.030 --> 38:37.962
- WHOO-HOO!

38:38.070 --> 38:39.162

FLOORS, BUDDY.

38:39.280 --> 38:41.100
- AWESOME.

38:41.210 --> 38:42.438

38:42.560 --> 38:43.128
I BET YOU CAN SLIDE WITH
THOSE SOCKS FROM THE DOOR

38:43.250 --> 38:44.103
ALL THE WAY TO THE KITCHEN.

38:44.210 --> 38:46.838
COME ON.
I WANT TO SEE THIS.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.639
I MEAN, YOU KNOW.

38:55.740 --> 38:56.877
- HEY, BABY. WE ARE HOME.

38:56.980 --> 38:57.469
- JUST A TINY BIT OF HELP
FROM UNCLE JOEL,

38:57.570 --> 38:58.184
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

38:58.300 --> 39:00.507
- HMM.

39:00.610 --> 39:02.054
DID HE MENTION IF THERE'S
GONNA BE ANY OTHER LEAKS

39:02.160 --> 39:05.266
IN THE HOUSE?

39:05.370 --> 39:09.443
- YOU KNOW,
TRUTH BE TOLD,

39:09.550 --> 39:10.949
HE MAY HAVE MENTIONED

39:11.070 --> 39:12.788
THAT THERE WAS A POTENTIAL

39:12.900 --> 39:16.176
FOR A LEAK
WITH THE HOT WATER HEATER.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.417
IT WAS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE,
THOUGH.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.487
NOW I KNOW HOW TO LAY

39:18.590 --> 39:19.659
HARDWOOD FLOORS.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

39:25.050 --> 39:26.358
I DID GET US HOME.

39:26.460 --> 39:27.836
- YOU DID.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.672
- ARE YOU EXCITED, MAMA?

39:42.750 --> 39:44.331
- I HAD TO READ
THE HUNGRY CATERPILLAR

39:44.450 --> 39:45.200
ONE MORE TIME TO GET HER TO BED.

39:45.310 --> 39:48.302
MY BRAIN WAS GONNA EXPLODE.

39:48.420 --> 39:50.888
- SHE LOVES THAT BOOK.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.797
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

39:56.220 --> 39:58.688
WHAT'S THIS?

40:01.640 --> 40:03.562

40:08.500 --> 40:11.367
I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO OPEN IT.

40:11.470 --> 40:14.405
- WOULD IT HELP
IF WE OPENED IT TOGETHER?

ENJOY THE RIDE.
LOVE, GWEN."

40:47.230 --> 40:48.197
[sighs]

40:52.820 --> 40:53.479

40:53.580 --> 40:56.549
