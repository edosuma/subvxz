WEBVTT

00:01.602 --> 00:04.338
( drilling )

01:21.182 --> 01:22.616
Donna Emerson,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.218
senior partner.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.120
My God, that does
have a ring to it,

01:26.220 --> 01:27.855
doesn't it?

01:27.955 --> 01:29.823
Here.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.193
You know I like redheads,
but my God,

01:32.293 --> 01:34.528
that new girl at reception
got a real attitude.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.398
- She make you sign in?
- Well, she damn well did.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
Hey, I'm sorry
I missed the celebration.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.335
We had a big storm
down in the San Juans.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.206
Wow. I never pegged you
for a Montblanc kind of guy.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.708
Well, I ain't.
I thought it would go
with the decor.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.478
Also got that nice
little snowflake thing
right on top.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.781
- Thanks, boss.
- Sure.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.749
Jeez.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.621
Hey, you wanna
stick around?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.556
Maybe got downstairs,
get a cup of coffee, or--?

02:02.656 --> 02:04.358
Oh, I would love to,
but, uh...

02:04.458 --> 02:05.793
I gotta hit the road.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.462
Diane's already
up at the Vineyard.

02:10.498 --> 02:12.200
Look, anyway,

02:12.300 --> 02:13.601
congrats.

02:17.671 --> 02:20.508
Oh, say.
Are you going to
Comdex this year?

02:22.310 --> 02:26.680
Uh... no.
Too much work this year.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.517
Oh, you know,
it's a circus now.
Not like it used to be.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.352
It's more trouble
than it's worth.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.755
Well...

02:34.855 --> 02:37.725
All right.
Hey, now, that's
the good stuff.

02:37.825 --> 02:40.428
Remember,
respect the dirty bird

02:40.528 --> 02:42.230
or fear
the kickin' chicken.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.565
"Kickin' chicken"?

03:16.029 --> 03:18.732
Announcer:
...16-point lead.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.369
( overlapping, indistinct
television announcers)

03:21.469 --> 03:22.736
Announcer:
...1:09 to go,

03:22.836 --> 03:24.572
14 to nothing...

03:24.672 --> 03:26.807
( overlapping, indistinct
television announcers)

03:30.444 --> 03:32.680
( no audio )

03:36.950 --> 03:39.387
( speed dial, phone rings )

03:39.487 --> 03:40.821
Morning, Ray.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.259
Mm-hmm.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.729
Amgen's a yes,
put it on the tape.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.230
( pen clicking )

03:50.331 --> 03:51.832
Yeah,
I'm not interested, Ray.

03:51.932 --> 03:52.766
Pass.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.972
Pass.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.411
Pass.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.347
The guy's hunting elephants
but bagging pigeons, Ray.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.448
Pass.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.816
Pass, Ray.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.387
What's your position
on Lam Research?

04:16.790 --> 04:18.726
All right,
set up a limit order.

04:18.826 --> 04:21.629
I'm not interested.
You know I'm long on telecom.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.397
That's all.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.269
Man:
Look, we'd just prefer

04:29.370 --> 04:30.838
if it was you coming out,
even for one night.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.806
Guys, you're in great hands.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.476
Elias will make sure
that CaminoWare
is the talk of Comdex.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.811
- Wait, wait, wait--
- And by the time
you're back in San Jose,

04:37.911 --> 04:40.481
I'll have the table set
for your Series B financing.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.450
How does that sound?

04:42.550 --> 04:43.917
All right.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.786
Well,
we should go pack.

04:45.886 --> 04:46.887
Yeah.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.423
Yeah, yeah.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.460
Oh, Jesus, guys,
I've got your Heinekens.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.629
Whatever you do,
don't do that at Comdex.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.997
Okay, thanks.

04:57.097 --> 04:59.833
It was really
sweet of you.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.303
Hey, Donna. This is
your area of expertise.
Settle a bet for me.

05:03.404 --> 05:06.474
This fellow thinks the feds
are gonna deregulate
all of NSFNET by '91.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.908
( chuckles )

05:08.008 --> 05:09.343
Gordon Clark,
this here is--

05:09.443 --> 05:11.078
Donna. Donna Emerson.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.580
Nice to meet you.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.415
Yeah, so I said the goddamn
federal government

05:14.515 --> 05:16.450
can't even deliver my
Playboys without some creep

05:16.550 --> 05:17.751
swiping them
every other month.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.453
'93 at the earliest.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.888
Well, there's a senator
in Tennessee.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.823
He's a real dog with a bone
on this thing.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.825
- Oh, you seem really
sure of yourself.
- I am.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.060
And you know,
for a long time I wasn't.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.898
and then this... weight
was suddenly lifted off of me.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.866
What kind of weight
exactly?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.968
Like someone poured cement

05:35.068 --> 05:36.637
in a bunch of bowling balls

05:36.737 --> 05:38.672
and then strapped
those bowling balls

05:38.772 --> 05:39.807
onto a big fat circus man

05:39.907 --> 05:41.742
and then he climbed
this ladder...

05:41.842 --> 05:44.011
- And then stood
on your shoulders?
- You get it.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.915
I do! I cut loose
a ball and chain
of my own recently.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.617
- Mm.
- Very liberating.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.820
So, what now?
Just casual sex and cosmos?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.822
- Casual sex and martinis.
- Mm.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.858
Oh, but "casual" makes
it sound boring, lazy.

05:57.958 --> 06:01.862
I'd rather go with
"hot and dirty" sex.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.397
Speaking of,
what are you doing later?

06:03.497 --> 06:05.899
Mm. Hot date, sorry.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.768
We'll settle
the bet later.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.503
Yes, we will.

06:09.603 --> 06:10.904
( clears throat )

06:12.473 --> 06:13.841
Who was that?

06:13.941 --> 06:15.909
I don't know.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.712
So, congratulations,
it's official.

06:21.782 --> 06:25.385
Donna Emerson.
You really couldn't stand
being a Clark, could you?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.055
Emerson has three syllables.
It's got stature, you know?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.624
Plus, it takes up more space
on the sign, so.

06:30.724 --> 06:34.061
Well, my name,
your dad's name--
what's the difference?

06:34.161 --> 06:37.164
We should probably get a move on
if we want to get our
reservation, Gordo.

06:37.264 --> 06:40.100
Um, yeah.
Uh, Michelle,
this is Donna.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.402
- Donna,
this is Michelle.
- Oh, of course.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.137
Hi. Nice to meet you.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.606
You as well.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.609
Um, let me just
close out my tab?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.544
Sure, yeah.
I'm gonna grab my coat.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.546
It was--
It was nice meeting you.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.485
Gordo?

06:57.585 --> 07:01.054
Ms. Emerson.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.623
She seems nice.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.124
She is.

07:04.224 --> 07:06.426
Hey, can you watch
Joanie on Friday?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.128
Haley's still at space camp
and, you know,

07:08.228 --> 07:10.664
Joanie just listens to CDs
and makes collages.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.032
You really don't
have to do anything.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.667
Look, Diane's
at the Vineyard,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.936
Elias is at Comdex,
Gilson's useless,

07:16.036 --> 07:17.805
so, the whole company's
on my shoulders.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.206
I just thought I'd ask.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.609
Suck it up.
It's your turn.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.790
"The Star-Spangled Banner"
playing in background

07:40.260 --> 07:45.465
* Over the land
of the free... *

07:46.567 --> 07:49.002
( phone rings )

07:49.102 --> 07:51.471
* And the home...

07:51.572 --> 07:55.943
- ( ringing )
- * Of the brave

07:57.244 --> 07:59.580
( ringing continues )

08:00.881 --> 08:02.249
- Yeah?
- Joe.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.752
It's Donna.

08:07.555 --> 08:09.489
Donna Clark.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.758
How have you been?

08:12.225 --> 08:14.261
You shouldn't
have this number.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.797
All right, look,
I'll cut to the chase.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.065
Are you going to Comdex?

08:19.800 --> 08:20.901
What do you want, Donna?

08:22.870 --> 08:24.504
Cameron will be there.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.745
I want to send you
something...

08:31.845 --> 08:33.647
to give to her--
a memo.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.651
You want me to go to Comdex

08:37.751 --> 08:39.653
to give Cameron...

08:39.753 --> 08:41.589
a memo?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.056
Just read it.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.058
If it makes the same impression
on you as it made on me,

08:45.158 --> 08:46.994
you'll be on
the next plane to Vegas.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.929
If you want to get in touch
with Cameron so bad,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.031
why are you calling me, not her?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.666
You know why.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.237
Joe, this thing
is perfect for her.

08:57.337 --> 09:00.574
Just... read it.
You'll see.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.080
I can't help you.
Good-bye, Donna.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.255
( ringing )

09:15.355 --> 09:18.826
( fax machine beeps )

09:20.828 --> 09:22.730
( beeping )

09:27.400 --> 09:29.637
( music playing )

10:10.277 --> 10:11.912
Mrs. Howe-Rendon?

10:12.012 --> 10:13.013
Hi.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.015
I almost didn't
recognize you.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.217
I expected
you'd be wearing
a leather jacket

10:17.317 --> 10:20.353
and have a bunch
of tattoos.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.755
Like in Space Bike.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.658
We're different people.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.259
Of course.

10:26.359 --> 10:29.062
Oh.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.164
Let's get you
set up.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.800
( soft laugh )

10:35.803 --> 10:37.705
They fly you all the way
out from the Orient

10:37.805 --> 10:40.207
just for this?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.341
Amazing.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.213
Here it is.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.316
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.691
Hi, I'm Tracy.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.894
Hi, Tracy.

11:00.994 --> 11:04.664
They told me not to sit
on the bike because
I might crush it.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.301
- That's probably good advice.
- ( laughs )

11:08.401 --> 11:11.438
You've got a few minutes
to settle in before
the signing starts.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.906
Oh, yeah.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.979
Here's your lunch.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.280
As you requested,

11:20.380 --> 11:23.683
a bean and cheese burrito.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.354
Thank you.

11:27.454 --> 11:28.989
I've been in Japan
for four years.

11:29.089 --> 11:29.990
Oh.

11:31.491 --> 11:33.160
Mmm.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.130
If I had to choose one word
to describe myself,

11:37.230 --> 11:39.366
I guess I would say, um,
"seeker."

11:39.466 --> 11:42.803
Yeah, you know?
And, uh...

11:42.903 --> 11:45.338
And "giver." Yeah.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.874
I mean,
I'm a tech professional

11:46.974 --> 11:48.341
but I'm not just
bits and bytes.

11:48.441 --> 11:51.178
I own a regional network
that's part of NSFNET,

11:51.278 --> 11:53.046
which connects researchers

11:53.146 --> 11:55.248
to the National Science
Foundation

11:55.348 --> 11:57.785
super-computing center,

11:57.885 --> 12:01.822
via T-1 backbone
through a Unix-based rout--

12:01.922 --> 12:03.223
Look,
( clears throat )

12:03.323 --> 12:05.058
let's just say
I do well for myself.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.360
Fun is very important to me,

12:07.460 --> 12:11.731
and listen, if, you know,
it's casual,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.934
you know, it stays casual,
I'm okay with that.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.769
And if it becomes something
more than casual

12:15.869 --> 12:19.006
then I'm okay with that too.
Yeah.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.475
And I like camping.
I really like camping.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.411
Do-- do you like camping?

12:24.511 --> 12:27.915
Recently, I've gotten
into fine cuisine,
uh, cooking.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.017
But, like, really doing it.

12:30.117 --> 12:33.053
You get to cook something,
and then you look at it,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.989
and you think,
"I made this!"

12:36.089 --> 12:38.792
And then you get to eat it
and then move on.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.962
That makes me happy.

12:42.062 --> 12:45.432
My, uh, name--
Can I look into the thing?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.167
- Uh, my name is Gordon...
- Joanie?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.802
number 108A-2...

12:48.902 --> 12:50.503
Joanie, that is private.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.040
Mm. Yeah.
Making a video
that screams

12:53.140 --> 12:54.808
"I need to get laid"
is totally private.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.144
"Get laid"?
Who taught you that?

12:57.244 --> 12:59.947
Dad, I know kids
in school giving handjobs

13:00.047 --> 13:01.481
in the parking lot.
I'm not a kid.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.051
No, you don't.
And yes, you are.

13:04.151 --> 13:07.020
All right.
Now, what time am I
taking you to this party?

13:07.120 --> 13:10.223
- It starts at 9:00.
- Can I take you a little
earlier?

13:10.323 --> 13:12.993
My date-- Okay.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.964
I'm cooking dinner
for someone and
she'll be here at 7:30.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.933
Yeah, but Jennifer is seeing
Child's Play 2 at 6:30

13:20.033 --> 13:21.434
to go stalk Bobby Ostoff.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.204
So, she probably won't
even be back until 8:30.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.439
The party's at Jennifer's?

13:26.539 --> 13:28.976
Mom said I could go.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.478
Yeah, well, Mom told me
that Diane was out of town
all week.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.513
You can't go to a party
if there aren't
any parents there.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.282
- You know that.
- But Mom said!

13:35.382 --> 13:37.217
Joanie, when you're
staying with me,

13:37.317 --> 13:40.020
- I make the decisions.
- God!

13:40.120 --> 13:42.322
- Joanie?
- Ugh!

13:48.395 --> 13:49.296
Thanks.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.433
Right, okay,
so I've got some
banging ideas

13:53.533 --> 13:55.335
for Space Bike 5.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.905
Okay, so there's this--
there's this space goldfish--

13:58.005 --> 13:59.606
Fantastic!
So, just pay over there.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.412
- Hi, I'm Jessica.
- Hey.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.214
Alex.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.182
You two going
to the Atari keynote
later?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.584
- Yeah.
- Good.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.087
Don't let boys like that
push their way in front of you.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.622
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.124
Okay.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.100
Can you make it out
to "Joe"?

14:35.542 --> 14:38.511
Yeah, it's just a really
amazing culture, you know?

14:38.611 --> 14:41.048
Do you even speak Japanese?

14:41.148 --> 14:42.615
( speaking Japanese )

14:42.715 --> 14:44.651
Ooh.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.553
That means,
"I don't want the shrimp
with the heads on."

14:46.653 --> 14:50.223
It's a very useful
phrase in Tokyo.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.625
So, you're gonna stay?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.494
Maybe, yeah.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.198
It's-- I don't know,
we've really settled in.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.599
It was weird at first.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.634
like, alien, you know?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.503
And that's what
Space Bike 2
was all about.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.472
It was just,
Tom was working a ton

15:05.572 --> 15:08.241
and I was wandering around
this strange city
feeling lost.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.343
And then...

15:10.443 --> 15:13.080
I don't know, one day
I just decided to give
myself over to it.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.149
Just like that, like a--
like a switch...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.485
flicked in your brain?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.454
Yeah.
( laughs )

15:21.554 --> 15:23.991
It's just,
you go through life

15:24.091 --> 15:26.293
and you have this idea
of who you are,

15:26.393 --> 15:28.661
and what you do,
and then...

15:28.761 --> 15:30.497
you discover
it's total bullshit.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.665
It's a defense mechanism,

15:32.765 --> 15:35.435
and once you stop
defending yourself
you can be

15:35.535 --> 15:37.270
all these other things,
and that...

15:37.370 --> 15:40.107
- Yeah.
- seems totally cheesy.

15:40.207 --> 15:42.042
No, it's not.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.476
I still suck
at using chopsticks.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.349
So, what are you
doing here?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.151
Are you still
consulting?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.989
I'm thinking about
getting back into that,

15:56.089 --> 15:57.624
if the gig is right.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.397
It's amazing how much changes
in just a few years.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.069
And how much stays the same.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.706
So, what do you think?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.542
What should I see?

16:15.642 --> 16:18.278
Oh, uh...

16:18.378 --> 16:20.147
Well, you can skip
all the laptops.

16:20.247 --> 16:23.283
They're just variations
on a theme.

16:23.383 --> 16:26.353
Uh... the Microsoft booth
is "ugh."

16:26.453 --> 16:29.589
Gates' speech is overrated.
Just get the transcript.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.525
Oh, Phillips
just released
a recordable CD

16:32.625 --> 16:36.329
and Adobe added some
cool stuff to this thing
called Photoshop.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.398
So...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.200
Yeah, great.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.701
That's interesting.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.570
Yeah.
( laughs )

16:45.772 --> 16:47.607
Well, God, it was--

16:47.707 --> 16:49.276
it was great to see you,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.278
and, uh,
this was a lot of fun.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.313
Wait. Are those...

16:53.413 --> 16:55.348
those guys from '83

16:55.448 --> 16:57.484
that had that really
terrible printer?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.386
You convinced them
you were from IBM?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.221
Oh!

17:01.321 --> 17:04.424
Yeah. We bought out
their suite for the Giant.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.794
That suite came with that
free seafood tower.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.063
Hey, what are you doing?

17:10.163 --> 17:14.201
Offering, uh,
fully-integrated
TypeKit compatibility

17:14.301 --> 17:17.304
while our superior
heat sink

17:17.404 --> 17:20.440
ensures that your...

17:20.540 --> 17:23.543
presentation won't drown,
but rather, float...

17:23.643 --> 17:25.112
Into the sky.

17:25.212 --> 17:28.281
Moreover,
paper jams can scram...

17:28.381 --> 17:30.117
( screams, laughs )

17:30.217 --> 17:31.484
- That just happens.
- Um...

17:31.584 --> 17:34.754
meaning that you can
sit back and relax....

17:34.854 --> 17:38.258
And enjoy the flight--
the flight of your data,
that is,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.627
due to transfer speeds
so fast

17:40.727 --> 17:44.264
that you'll think
your documents were...

17:44.364 --> 17:46.166
Come on.
Come on, Petey.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.700
There's a little breeze.
Get your hand in front of it.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.569
Use your backhand.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.837
On fire.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.207
Cool, cool, cool.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.743
So, it's called the, uh,
the "S Printer"?

17:56.843 --> 17:58.611
Oh, no, um... "Sprinter."

17:58.711 --> 18:01.414
- Because it prints
really fast.
- No space.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.083
It's kind of confusing
with the flame gag, though.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.819
- It's a mixed metaphor.
- "S Printer" does
sound better, though.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.688
- Doesn't it?
- Yeah. It's got
rigor behind it.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.790
Like the R&D Department
was unsatisfied

18:10.890 --> 18:12.592
with models A through R,

18:12.692 --> 18:14.327
and then finally,
after a lot of sweat
and tears...

18:14.427 --> 18:15.828
We proudly bring you
version S.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.365
Um... it's the Sprinter.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.699
No space.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.434
Hey, do I know you?

18:21.534 --> 18:24.504
Here, help yourself
to a lighter.
No, just one, please.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.838
- Oh, that's a lot.
- Good luck, guys.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.875
- Not all of--
- She took so many.

18:28.975 --> 18:31.144
Just one, please,
one.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.114
( rock music
playing in distance )

18:39.186 --> 18:41.120
( doorbell rings )

18:54.534 --> 18:56.703
- Hey. Michelle.
- Hi. Hi.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.405
What you got, what's--

18:58.505 --> 18:59.806
Oh, it uh,

18:59.906 --> 19:02.609
it says "kiss the cook"
but in binary code.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.844
- ( laughing )
- So, uh.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.346
Oh. Well.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.215
It smells great.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.849
That's the Bolognese.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.285
You know, a lot of people
think that pasta's Italian,

19:12.385 --> 19:13.786
but it actually
originated in China.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.389
- Huh.
- Yeah, 1100 B.C.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.791
You're taking me
to the party. I left
a message on Mom's service.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.194
- She's gonna tell you
to let me go.
- Um, Joanie?

19:21.294 --> 19:23.463
- This is Michelle.
- Hi.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.432
Michelle, this is
my lovely daughter,
Joanie.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.833
- Hello.
- Hey.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.802
I, uh--
I like your shirt.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.171
It's very... cultural.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.906
Do you like culture?

19:34.006 --> 19:37.244
( laughs )
What's it, um, say?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.946
Well, "shonen"
is Japanese for "boy."

19:40.046 --> 19:41.781
So, it means "boy knife."

19:41.881 --> 19:43.316
Huh.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.252
"Boy knife" means "dick."

19:46.686 --> 19:48.621
- Hmm.
- Um, do you want some wine?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.323
- Mm-hmm.
- ( clears throat )

19:53.260 --> 19:55.362
Cameron:
I wonder how high
you'd have to be up

19:55.462 --> 19:57.564
for your spit
to actually kill someone.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.632
( laughing )

20:06.573 --> 20:08.475
( yawning )

20:10.810 --> 20:13.480
Okay, let's see
what we got.

20:15.014 --> 20:15.948
Ooh.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.927
What do you think?

20:28.027 --> 20:30.597
Oh, I wouldn't.
They make your ass look big.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.968
Oh, okay.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.340
Here are the rules.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.741
Four rows of lighters.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.511
When it's your turn,
you can take as many

20:44.611 --> 20:47.280
or as few as you want,
as long as they're
from the same row.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.949
The person who ends up
with the last lighter
loses.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.319
You wanna go first
or second?

20:52.419 --> 20:53.686
Mm, bold.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.022
Is there anything
on the floor catch
your eye?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.458
No, I'm going whole hog
on the Sprinter.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.660
Those guys really have
their finger on the pulse.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.564
Actually it was...

21:06.766 --> 21:08.901
it was all
pretty overwhelming.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.908
You know,
if you look closely,

21:16.008 --> 21:17.910
there are some diamonds
in those dorks.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.613
( laughs )
Would you really
wish me on anyone?

21:25.685 --> 21:27.787
You lose.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.525
You go first this time.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.063
Hey,
I knew what I was doing,

21:37.163 --> 21:40.066
you know,
when we worked together.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.970
And Mutiny took a nosedive
all on its own,

21:44.070 --> 21:46.873
didn't need you
to screw that one up for us.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.609
And Gordon,

21:49.709 --> 21:52.645
would be the first to admit
that he made his own bed.

21:56.549 --> 21:57.950
Yeah, but...

22:02.922 --> 22:05.525
But Ryan, right?

22:10.763 --> 22:12.899
Yeah, Tom and I were...

22:15.735 --> 22:17.670
leaving for Japan
when we heard.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.909
At first I was...

22:23.009 --> 22:24.811
angry.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.946
At you...

22:27.046 --> 22:28.347
and at him.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.650
And at myself...

22:30.750 --> 22:34.487
for all these things
I never said to him.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.858
Then I realized

22:38.958 --> 22:40.960
there was nothing anyone
could have done about it.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.896
Not you and not me.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.399
- You don't know that.
- Neither do you.

22:47.834 --> 22:50.102
You're not that powerful.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.644
So, eventually, my anger

22:57.744 --> 22:59.546
turned into sadness,

22:59.646 --> 23:02.381
and...

23:02.482 --> 23:04.150
that's fine,
that's healthy.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.891
I mean, yes, be sad.

23:11.991 --> 23:15.094
But Jesus,
stop blaming yourself.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.645
I win.

23:38.718 --> 23:42.555
This isn't about Ryan.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.691
It's, um...

23:44.791 --> 23:47.794
I'm just saying
I don't think you should...

23:47.894 --> 23:49.829
deprive the world
of what you do.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.165
Okay.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.936
What is it that I do?

24:01.774 --> 24:05.712
It's so hard...

24:05.812 --> 24:08.815
to bring about
actual change.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.483
Real change.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.218
The whole world

24:12.318 --> 24:14.987
conspires to stop that
from happening.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.024
But you bring people together.

24:20.259 --> 24:23.129
You... create change.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.572
I think that that's...

24:32.672 --> 24:34.140
really great.

24:50.022 --> 24:52.491
Hey, so I have this

24:52.592 --> 24:54.727
Atari party
that I have to go to

24:54.827 --> 24:57.664
that would be so much
more fun if you would come

24:57.764 --> 24:59.198
and get drunk with me.

24:59.298 --> 25:00.900
What, so I can fend off
your groupies?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.602
Exactly.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.970
Mm.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.072
I'm not really dressed
for that kind of thing.

25:09.742 --> 25:11.010
Okay.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.515
Well...

25:16.616 --> 25:17.817
Okay.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.719
Now I'm ready.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.154
( laughs )
The future's so bright.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.724
( laughing )

25:27.760 --> 25:30.663
Anyways,
back to the important stuff.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.665
Do you know why most people
screw up their pasta?

25:32.765 --> 25:34.701
- Here we go.
- Not salting the water enough.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.769
You know, it should
taste like the ocean.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.971
You know, when properly
portioned,

25:39.071 --> 25:40.973
salt will not
make food taste salty,

25:41.073 --> 25:42.775
but instead will enhance
the flavors that are
already present.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.244
- ( phone rings )
- It's for me. It's my mom.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.648
She's a partner at a VC firm
so she has her own messaging
service.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.282
- ( clicks on )
- Mom?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.685
Joanie, I got your voicemail.
What's going on?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.887
You made it sound
like World War III
from your message.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.856
Yeah, Dad won't let me
go to the party,
which is bullshit

25:56.956 --> 25:59.058
because you explicitly
told me I could go.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.761
I'm sure he has good
reasons, Bug.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.797
There is no good reason
why I should be stuck here

26:04.897 --> 26:08.200
making pasta from scratch
with freaking Chef Boyardee
and some random lady.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.005
Is it that Michelle woman?

26:13.105 --> 26:17.844
Bingo-rama.
She works for Dad.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.779
Look, when you're at Dad's
house, his word goes.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.280
You know the rules.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.316
- Can you just talk to him?
- No, I don't have time--

26:24.416 --> 26:26.819
Dad! Mom wants to talk to you.

26:32.358 --> 26:33.826
So, what grade are you in?

26:33.926 --> 26:35.061
You know, I'm gonna, like,
go in a second.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.829
You don't have to
talk to me anymore.

26:36.929 --> 26:39.598
Donna, I don't wanna
have this conversation
right now.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.367
- Neither do I.
- She wants to go over
to Jennifer's

26:41.467 --> 26:43.135
and there's not gonna be
any parents there.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.104
I already told her that
she has to listen to you.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.373
She just put you on the phone
because she thought we'd fight

26:47.473 --> 26:49.876
and she'd come out on top.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.678
( laughs )

26:51.778 --> 26:54.080
Since when do you make pasta?

26:54.180 --> 26:56.816
Oh, well, I-I--

26:56.916 --> 26:58.985
I took a cooking class.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.920
Ah.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.692
My parents got divorced
when I was little, too,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.827
so, I know it stinks.

27:07.927 --> 27:08.861
But it gets better.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.968
All right, you're, uh,
you're not going.

27:16.068 --> 27:20.072
So, even with a conservative
estimate of the licensing fees

27:20.172 --> 27:22.174
for the voice-recognition
component,

27:22.274 --> 27:25.978
we'll be in three million
domestic refrigerator-freezers
by the end of Q3.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.380
And I'll hit profitability
by Q4.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.316
So, what is it you do?

27:30.416 --> 27:33.385
- I think this is
definitely him.
- I think it's him!

27:33.485 --> 27:36.255
Listen, man,
we hereby confer
upon you--

27:36.355 --> 27:37.256
Uh, Bob.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.158
( together )
Bob!

27:39.258 --> 27:41.894
...the greatest honor
of Comdex '90:

27:41.994 --> 27:43.730
the Party Pitch Swami

27:43.830 --> 27:45.664
and a Vanquisher
of Earthly Tedium.

27:45.765 --> 27:49.001
And we proudly
present to you...

27:49.101 --> 27:50.402
This...

27:50.502 --> 27:53.039
100% synthetic

27:53.139 --> 27:56.242
ergonomically designed
OSHA-approved

27:56.342 --> 27:58.277
Cisco wrist rest.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.079
Live the life
of your words, Bob.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.416
"Velouria" playing
in background

28:04.516 --> 28:07.019
* On to somewhere near

28:07.119 --> 28:11.057
* And far in time

28:11.157 --> 28:14.994
* Velouria

28:15.094 --> 28:17.964
* Her covering

28:18.064 --> 28:22.101
* Traveling career

28:22.201 --> 28:26.405
* She can really move

28:26.505 --> 28:29.776
* Oh, velveteen!

28:29.876 --> 28:32.278
* My Velouria

28:32.378 --> 28:35.414
* My Velouria

28:35.514 --> 28:39.151
* Even I'll adore ya

28:39.251 --> 28:42.121
* My Velouria

28:42.221 --> 28:46.025
* Even I'll adore ya

28:46.125 --> 28:48.828
* My Velouria

28:51.898 --> 28:53.866
* Say to me

28:53.966 --> 28:55.434
Hey.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.069
* Where have you been?

28:57.169 --> 28:58.270
You want a refill?

28:58.370 --> 28:59.471
Yeah!

29:01.207 --> 29:03.409
Jesus, my refills
want refills!

29:03.509 --> 29:05.144
( laughs )

29:05.244 --> 29:07.113
* And how does
lemur's skin *

29:07.213 --> 29:10.516
* Reflect the sea?

29:10.616 --> 29:14.353
* Move away in the shine
of the other *

29:14.453 --> 29:18.190
* Move away in the shine
of the other *

29:18.290 --> 29:22.361
* Move away in the tides
of the summer *

29:22.461 --> 29:26.365
* Every summer, every
My Velouria *

29:26.465 --> 29:28.467
I love Space Bike!

29:28.567 --> 29:31.337
Oh! I love you!
( laughing )

29:39.278 --> 29:41.080
Woman:
Cameron?

29:42.181 --> 29:44.350
Cameron!

29:44.450 --> 29:46.886
How are you?
How's Japan?

29:46.986 --> 29:48.120
* California

29:48.220 --> 29:49.856
What are you doing here?

29:49.956 --> 29:53.492
- You know, I just...
- * I can see the tears...

29:53.592 --> 29:57.029
came to make an appearance
at the parties, and...

29:57.129 --> 29:58.564
Okay--

29:58.664 --> 30:00.833
Look, I--

30:00.933 --> 30:04.503
I came to see you.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.139
I don't know why
you would do that.

30:07.239 --> 30:10.843
Well, because
I've got this--

30:10.943 --> 30:12.845
There's this thing.

30:12.945 --> 30:14.813
It's really exciting
and I want to show it to you.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.482
- You've got to be kidding.
- Please, just--

30:16.582 --> 30:18.350
Come on, have lunch
with me tomorrow.

30:18.450 --> 30:21.187
No, I'm on an early
flight out to Tokyo.

30:22.889 --> 30:25.024
It's been four years,
we need to--

30:25.124 --> 30:27.393
We don't need
to do anything!

30:27.493 --> 30:29.561
We both did things
we're not proud of,

30:29.661 --> 30:32.598
and if could turn back
the clock, I'm sure
we'd do it differently.

30:32.698 --> 30:35.501
I can't believe
this is happening.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.569
What, you're gonna tell me
that you've completely moved on?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.171
No.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.408
I think about
you and me every day.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.311
And it makes me furious.

30:45.411 --> 30:47.880
So, let's fix it.
I wanna fix it.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.381
I don't.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.185
Everything okay?

30:53.285 --> 30:54.620
Let's go.

30:57.056 --> 31:00.927
* Oh, hey

31:01.027 --> 31:03.595
* Velouria

31:03.695 --> 31:07.599
* Oh, hey

31:07.699 --> 31:10.569
* Velouria

31:10.669 --> 31:12.438
* Velouria

31:16.342 --> 31:18.110
Parmigiano-Reggiano?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.179
Yes, please.

31:20.279 --> 31:21.914
I'm a vegetarian.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.649
Oh, yeah?
Since when?

31:23.749 --> 31:25.651
Since I started
paying attention

31:25.751 --> 31:28.654
to the thinking,
feeling creatures
we share the planet with,

31:28.754 --> 31:30.923
and realized they probably
don't like being eaten.

31:31.023 --> 31:32.424
That's since when.

31:32.524 --> 31:35.394
Well,
you can rinse yours off.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.963
Mmm.

31:37.063 --> 31:39.231
Too late.
It's tainted.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.068
Mmm. This is really good.

31:42.168 --> 31:43.902
Mm.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.337
Grazie.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.306
What did you put in this?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.375
Ah, it's the Bolognese.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.944
It's taken a while
to perfect, but--

31:53.512 --> 31:54.981
( sighs )

31:57.116 --> 31:58.985
Did you know

31:59.085 --> 32:01.320
that almost
all beef you buy
at the supermarket

32:01.420 --> 32:03.455
tests positive
for E. coli?

32:03.555 --> 32:05.624
- Mm-mm.
- Because cows,
when they're slaughtered,

32:05.724 --> 32:08.627
are decapitated.
And when you
decapitate a cow,

32:08.727 --> 32:11.463
all the stuff
in the intestines
and the stomach

32:11.563 --> 32:15.034
flies out through
the neck hole,
all over the body.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.103
And E. coli is found
only in excrement.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.138
Basically...

32:19.238 --> 32:21.007
there's shit
in your Bolognese.

32:21.107 --> 32:23.009
Okay, Joanie,
we are trying to eat.

32:23.109 --> 32:25.144
So am I.

32:25.244 --> 32:27.613
And that's why
we all need to think about
the gross, and, like,

32:27.713 --> 32:31.250
inhumane process
that we get all the stuff
we consume on our plates.

32:31.350 --> 32:36.955
Well, did you know
there's a detectable level
of cow piss in most milk?

32:37.056 --> 32:38.424
( chuckles )

32:41.727 --> 32:44.163
You know, I understand.
When I was five,

32:44.263 --> 32:46.598
I gave up eggs
for a whole year

32:46.698 --> 32:48.300
because I thought
when you cracked the eggs,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.103
that you were killing
little baby chicks,

32:51.203 --> 32:54.440
and every time my dad
made an omelet I would
just burst into tears

32:54.540 --> 32:56.742
- and just cry for hours.
- ( laughs )

32:56.842 --> 32:59.211
I'm 14, not five.

33:01.447 --> 33:03.682
She'll grow out of it.
It's a phase.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.717
You think this
is just a phase?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.720
Okay, Joanie,
why don't you take your plate
into the other room

33:08.820 --> 33:10.589
and we'll talk
about this tomorrow.

33:10.689 --> 33:11.723
Fine.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.364
I am so sorry.

33:18.464 --> 33:21.100
No. No, no, no.
Why? I mean,

33:21.200 --> 33:23.035
I honestly
can barely taste

33:23.135 --> 33:25.137
the shit
in your spaghetti.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.611
Uh, for me,
friendship is...

33:32.711 --> 33:35.747
is very important.
I mean, I...

33:35.847 --> 33:37.416
It's not all
bits and bytes for me.

33:37.516 --> 33:38.584
( laughs )

33:38.684 --> 33:40.452
And I see a lot of movies

33:40.552 --> 33:43.255
and it would just be nice
to have someone special

33:43.355 --> 33:48.427
to share that with
or talk to about that stuff.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.229
Intimacy, that's--
it's-- that's nice.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.248
So, listen, um.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.151
I-- I really am sorry.

34:12.251 --> 34:13.352
I, um--

34:15.654 --> 34:17.489
- I'll see you
at the office.
- Okay.

34:21.127 --> 34:24.096
"Twist Barbie"
playing in background

34:24.196 --> 34:28.500
* Ooo, aah, aah

34:28.600 --> 34:31.270
* Bang, bang, bang,
Twist Barbie *

34:31.370 --> 34:33.505
* Bang, bang, bang,
Twist Barbie *

34:33.605 --> 34:36.175
* Bang, bang, bang,
Twist Barbie *

34:36.275 --> 34:37.409
* Bang--

34:37.509 --> 34:40.179
Joanie.

34:40.279 --> 34:42.414
What the hell was that?

34:42.514 --> 34:45.751
You should have just
let me go the party.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.686
Joanie,
just because you are
unhappy does not mean

34:47.786 --> 34:50.156
that you can inflict
your total misery
onto everyone else.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.791
- You're so obvious!
- What is that supposed to mean?

34:52.891 --> 34:55.861
You work for Mom
and now Michelle
works for you.

34:59.365 --> 35:02.768
You could do better.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.304
You already did once.

35:15.881 --> 35:17.483
Can you believe her?

35:17.583 --> 35:20.286
It's like she ambushed me.

35:20.386 --> 35:23.322
Why does she care so much
about kissing and making up?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.357
We don't even
live in the same
country anymore.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.730
She called me.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.768
A few days ago.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.170
Why?

35:41.207 --> 35:43.609
She wanted me to find you...

35:43.709 --> 35:46.212
and bring you some idea.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.684
That's why you're here?

35:52.784 --> 35:55.521
No.

35:55.621 --> 35:59.558
I told her if she
wanted to talk to you,
she could do it herself.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.293
I don't even know
what the idea was.

36:01.393 --> 36:03.895
I didn't read it
and I don't care.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.307
Come on, Cam.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.879
You can trust me.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.464
( wrapper crackling )

36:46.738 --> 36:48.206
( cork pops )

37:26.412 --> 37:28.447
God, that's terrible.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.618
Hey, I think
I figured it out.

37:36.622 --> 37:39.625
You can't beat me.
It's--

37:39.725 --> 37:41.960
It's a system.
You have to count
in Nim sums.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.362
It's just a trick.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.763
Why...

38:19.698 --> 38:21.967
are you here?

38:25.571 --> 38:27.539
You know why.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.713
Nope.

38:40.952 --> 38:42.488
Tell me.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.994
You.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.703
I came to see you.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.921
We shouldn't be up here.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.730
It's getting late.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.702
I have to leave
early tomorrow.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.376
Maybe we should
call it a night.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.715
Yeah.

39:51.857 --> 39:54.693
Yeah, we should
call it a night.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.706
( heavy breathing )

40:15.213 --> 40:16.682
( sharp moan )

40:47.846 --> 40:50.148
Boy on television:
...lawyer.

40:50.248 --> 40:51.717
Girl on television:
Slater, I am impressed.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.118
Spare me.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.487
I want to have
at least seven kids!

40:55.587 --> 40:58.924
Oh, great, so I'll have
to take a number to get
into the bathroom!

40:59.024 --> 41:01.927
Seven kids?
Slater, I don't know.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.495
Consistency.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.632
I can admire that.

41:06.732 --> 41:09.635
Slater: Why?
Because I'm a good boss.

41:11.537 --> 41:14.105
God, I hate it when
Slater does that

41:14.205 --> 41:16.041
stupid turnaround thing
with his chair.

41:16.141 --> 41:17.743
I know.

41:17.843 --> 41:19.745
It's like, okay, we get it,
you're the cool jock.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.112
( indistinct dialogue
continues )

41:26.184 --> 41:28.153
Are you serious?

41:28.253 --> 41:29.888
What?

41:29.988 --> 41:32.190
- You--
- I can't totally commit
to a label.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.594
People aren't one thing.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.031
Yeah.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.499
You're right.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.204
( sighs )
All right.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.650
Is it bad
this morning?

41:58.750 --> 42:00.852
No, it's fine.

42:00.952 --> 42:02.520
I'm just
a little stiff.

42:02.621 --> 42:05.957
Nothing a hot shower
won't fix.

42:11.329 --> 42:13.164
This is ridiculous.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.033
I'm making you switch
bedrooms with me.

42:15.133 --> 42:18.003
Climbing these stairs
is totally dumbass.

42:18.103 --> 42:21.640
Yeah. I'm sure that would
work out great for you.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.676
Nice fancy bed,
big closet...

42:24.776 --> 42:27.679
Oh, it's really
the bathroom I'm after.

42:57.275 --> 42:59.778
Working with you was...

42:59.878 --> 43:02.047
the most fun
I ever had in my life.

43:04.215 --> 43:05.784
Okay?

43:05.884 --> 43:07.686
Oh, Cam.

43:11.389 --> 43:14.159
I picked up the phone
so many times.

43:14.259 --> 43:17.863
Never actually called,
though. Did you?

43:21.166 --> 43:22.734
Well...

43:22.834 --> 43:25.003
I'm here now.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.105
Uh-huh.

43:28.339 --> 43:30.876
Did you even read it?

43:30.976 --> 43:32.310
What?

43:32.410 --> 43:35.213
What I sent Joe.
The idea.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.919
He never even
showed it to me.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.728
What was it?

44:58.864 --> 45:02.033
"Cold Light" playing

45:02.133 --> 45:03.234
* Put your heart
in the hands of the city *

45:07.405 --> 45:10.108
* Working hard
when you're not around *

45:13.178 --> 45:15.113
* Go home

45:15.213 --> 45:17.015
* Go home

45:17.115 --> 45:20.018
* Baby,
it'll be all right *

45:20.118 --> 45:23.388
* Put your life
into the cold light *

45:23.488 --> 45:25.924
* Put your life
into the cold light. *
