00:14.200 --> 00:15.068
- All right, so we're gonna 
go in.

00:15.101 --> 00:16.302
- Yeah, I'm rollin'.

00:16.335 --> 00:17.370
Sweet.

00:17.403 --> 00:18.871
- So we're gonna go in,

00:18.904 --> 00:19.739
meet these guys.

00:19.773 --> 00:20.774
They're, they tend to be.

00:21.675 --> 00:22.475
- Open.
- They're nice,

00:22.508 --> 00:23.977
but let's just, like, 
catch them fast

00:24.010 --> 00:26.045
because they tend to be
really busy, all right?

00:26.079 --> 00:27.279
Okay, here we go.
- I love that video

00:27.312 --> 00:29.381
on the home page.
- Hello.

00:30.316 --> 00:30.950
- Hey!
- Hey, guys,

00:30.984 --> 00:32.284
I wanna introduce you to my,

00:32.317 --> 00:32.986
my intern mark.

00:33.019 --> 00:35.721
Mark, this is Chris over there.

00:35.754 --> 00:37.122
This is Tom.

00:37.155 --> 00:38.023
- Oh hi, Tom, Mark.
- Nice to meet you.

00:38.056 --> 00:39.257
Intern, that means we're not
payin' ya.

00:39.291 --> 00:41.027
Right?
- No, he's in college.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.028
- Hi there.

00:43.061 --> 00:43.729
- Yeah, what's your--
- Mark.

00:43.762 --> 00:44.797
- Mark.
- We're doin' this.

00:44.830 --> 00:46.164
We're startin' this now?

00:46.198 --> 00:47.900
- We're gonna do it.
- Oh God.

00:47.933 --> 00:48.967
- Got the camera, showed up
early,

00:49.001 --> 00:50.668
and so I figured we should
just--

00:50.703 --> 00:52.070
- Start in your office,

00:52.104 --> 00:54.239
kinda like with the two of you.

00:54.272 --> 00:56.408
Right where the company
kinda like, you know,

00:56.441 --> 00:58.075
was born, right?
- Yeah!

00:58.109 --> 00:58.943
- Yeah, so--
- What if we have

00:58.976 --> 00:59.610
to go to the bathroom?

00:59.643 --> 01:00.544
Is he gonna come in with us?

01:00.577 --> 01:01.446
- He's gonna follow you into the
bathroom.

01:01.479 --> 01:02.147
And wherever else you want.

01:05.718 --> 01:07.218
I just wanna fix this
collar before we start

01:07.251 --> 01:09.721
'cause I feel like this
is the fashion stuff

01:09.754 --> 01:11.022
we've been talking about.
- This is gonna make

01:11.055 --> 01:12.925
the difference, I see.
- Yes, we have to make you

01:12.958 --> 01:14.759
look cool.

01:14.792 --> 01:15.426
Okay.

01:15.459 --> 01:16.794
All right, buddy.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.429
Okay, just, like, talk about
Gigaler.

01:18.462 --> 01:19.296
- Sure.
- And just, like,

01:19.330 --> 01:20.197
what's the pitch of--

01:20.231 --> 01:22.133
Here it is, this is for the
investors.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.836
There are tons of media sites
out there.

01:24.869 --> 01:27.004
Okay, what makes Gigaler
different?

01:27.038 --> 01:27.972
There are sites like YouTube

01:28.005 --> 01:29.006
where you'll watch a video

01:29.040 --> 01:29.873
on, on one thing,

01:29.906 --> 01:32.242
how to, how to set up a video
camera.

01:32.275 --> 01:33.444
You only need that video once.

01:33.477 --> 01:34.378
The next time you go to YouTube,

01:34.411 --> 01:37.048
it's got five more videos on how
to set up

01:37.081 --> 01:38.181
a, a camera.

01:38.214 --> 01:39.015
You don't need that.

01:39.049 --> 01:41.251
Here's what we're doing with
Gigaler.

01:41.284 --> 01:42.987
We're setting up an algorithm,

01:43.020 --> 01:44.421
a, a piece of software,

01:44.455 --> 01:46.422
that'll know what you wanna see

01:46.456 --> 01:48.224
based on what you've seen
before,

01:48.258 --> 01:49.760
based on your buying habits.

01:49.793 --> 01:50.861
We're tracking everything.

01:50.894 --> 01:52.062
Based on your votes on videos,

01:52.095 --> 01:53.229
your reviews on videos.

01:53.264 --> 01:55.298
So when you go the Gigaler.com
homepage,

01:55.331 --> 01:57.968
the media, the news, the video
content

01:58.001 --> 02:00.503
is going to be exactly what you
want.

02:00.536 --> 02:03.105
Gigaler.com, the more you know
Gigaler,

02:03.138 --> 02:05.141
the more Gigaler knows you.

02:06.042 --> 02:06.877
- Here we go.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.344
You're here.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.412
Uh, why don't you tell us about

02:09.445 --> 02:10.979
how you guys met.

02:12.347 --> 02:14.851
Uh, we met at a
place

02:14.885 --> 02:16.853
called DMV Easy.
- Easy.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.020
- That's right, baby.

02:18.053 --> 02:20.189
It was, uh, you know, it was
supposed to make the DMV,

02:20.222 --> 02:23.092
it was supposed to
streamline the DMV process.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.026
And what it did is,

02:24.059 --> 02:25.527
I think it turned into the web
equivalent

02:25.560 --> 02:27.396
of standing in line at the DMV.

02:27.429 --> 02:29.231
- Well, it was just a
website that people dreaded

02:29.264 --> 02:30.966
going to and couldn't wait to
leave.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.534
Exactly.

02:32.567 --> 02:35.037
- And we both started hating
our job at the same time.

02:35.070 --> 02:35.971
We'd leave work together

02:36.005 --> 02:37.206
and we'd kind of commiserate.

02:37.239 --> 02:39.241
We were, like, you know, we
should do something together.

02:39.274 --> 02:41.176
We should, you know, for fun.

02:41.210 --> 02:43.411
And so that's kind of where, uh,
uh,

02:43.444 --> 02:44.979
uh, Gigaler started.

02:45.013 --> 02:46.448
Was just the two of us, um,

02:46.481 --> 02:47.883
getting drunk together, uh,

02:47.917 --> 02:49.251
searching the web for, for shit

02:49.283 --> 02:50.852
that would make each other
laugh.

02:50.885 --> 02:51.552
- Get this on camera.

02:51.585 --> 02:52.686
We should say that, you know,

02:52.720 --> 02:56.091
we share space, uh, with
another, we, another company,

02:56.125 --> 02:58.159
and so this is not all our
offices, um.

02:58.192 --> 02:59.493
We have a lot of office space
here,

02:59.527 --> 03:01.095
but we do share it with another
company,

03:01.129 --> 03:02.363
just so you know.
- Yeah.

03:02.396 --> 03:03.231
We're gonna take
it over at some point though.

03:03.264 --> 03:04.098
- Yeah, we will.
- We'll take it over.

03:04.132 --> 03:04.498
- We'll have the whole building,
yeah.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.066
- Go, five.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.269
Show this, this is cool.

03:08.302 --> 03:09.137
- Yep.
- And here it is.

03:09.170 --> 03:10.404
Like, what, what's
one word

03:10.438 --> 03:13.306
that you would use to describe
Tom?

03:13.340 --> 03:14.374
- Fierce.

03:14.407 --> 03:17.078
- Yes, that's like a gay word.

03:17.111 --> 03:17.946
Yeah, in the gay
community,

03:17.979 --> 03:18.913
we all, you're so fierce. (snaps
fingers)

03:18.947 --> 03:19.713
- Well you know, we,
we've been hanging out,

03:19.747 --> 03:20.448
so I've been learning.
- I know,

03:20.481 --> 03:22.582
you've been influenced.
- Uh, I,

03:22.615 --> 03:24.184
yeah, no, he is,

03:24.217 --> 03:25.986
he is, you know, he is the guy

03:26.019 --> 03:27.455
that gets things done.

03:27.488 --> 03:29.189
I mean, God, look where we,

03:29.222 --> 03:30.991
look where we wound up.

03:31.024 --> 03:32.159
I, I don't know
how much you wanna share,

03:32.192 --> 03:34.227
but I think you should try
to share as much as you can

03:34.261 --> 03:36.196
so that, like, we can, you know,

03:36.229 --> 03:37.597
edit out what you don't feel
comfortable

03:37.630 --> 03:38.598
sharing.

03:38.631 --> 03:40.968
So, um,
you moved to Cleveland

03:41.001 --> 03:43.036
because of the divorce.
- Yeah.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.004
Well I moved back to Cleveland.

03:44.037 --> 03:45.337
I'm originally from here.

03:45.371 --> 03:48.241
Uh, went out, uh, to the west
coast,

03:48.275 --> 03:50.844
got married, and, yes, I did
come back

03:50.878 --> 03:52.079
due to the divorce,

03:52.112 --> 03:54.380
but, you know, it's
kind of a double thing.

03:54.413 --> 03:56.615
I, I was gonna stay in Silicon
Valley,

03:56.648 --> 03:59.052
working at DMV Easy with Chris.

03:59.086 --> 04:01.387
Uh, but then we started running
ads,

04:01.420 --> 04:02.354
and we started making money,

04:02.388 --> 04:05.124
and, you know, then,
then things became real.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.492
Do you wanna
talk about your kids?

04:06.525 --> 04:07.927
- No, no, no, not right now.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.428
I mean, you know, I
have two fantastic kids,

04:09.461 --> 04:11.363
but I don't think that's, uh,
you know,

04:11.397 --> 04:14.100
that's part of something
that we should put on film.

04:14.133 --> 04:16.435
Yeah, so what,

04:16.468 --> 04:17.535
what do you think is like your,

04:17.567 --> 04:19.872
your philosophy on life?

04:19.906 --> 04:21.940
- "Whenever you find yourself
on the side of the majority,

04:21.974 --> 04:24.910
"it is time to pause and
reflect."

04:24.943 --> 04:25.576
Mark Twain.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.878
So, yeah, um,

04:28.947 --> 04:30.316
I just don't, uh,

04:30.349 --> 04:32.184
I just don't ever wanna
be in the majority.

04:32.218 --> 04:33.384
Um,

04:33.418 --> 04:35.453
I think that I have something to
offer,

04:35.486 --> 04:36.521
and when I see too many people

04:36.554 --> 04:37.488
surrounding me,

04:37.522 --> 04:40.992
I know that it's a sign that I
should, uh,

04:41.026 --> 04:41.927
put my talents elsewhere

04:41.960 --> 04:43.028
because there's something new
that needs

04:43.061 --> 04:46.431
to be developed that people
aren't looking at yet.

04:46.464 --> 04:48.033
- Life is not a dress rehearsal.

04:48.066 --> 04:49.533
That's something that
I've always lived by.

04:49.566 --> 04:51.436
You know, I have a thing on my
wall,

04:51.469 --> 04:52.537
on my office wall,

04:52.570 --> 04:54.372
um, from John D. Rockefeller.

04:54.405 --> 04:55.373
But he says, um,

04:55.406 --> 04:58.142
"I was really taught to
work as well as play.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.610
"My life has been one long,
happy holiday,

05:00.644 --> 05:02.613
"full of work and full of play."

05:02.647 --> 05:04.015
Here's the important line.

05:04.049 --> 05:06.150
"I lost the worry on the way.

05:06.183 --> 05:07.684
"And God was good to me every
day."

05:07.717 --> 05:09.319
- And this is our fun area.

05:09.353 --> 05:12.522
This is, you know, other
accouterments,

05:12.556 --> 05:14.358
Golden Tee, pool table, and, of
course,

05:14.391 --> 05:15.625
foosball.

05:15.659 --> 05:17.227
- This is Chris' throne.
- Champ.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.930
I prefer red personally.

05:19.964 --> 05:22.566
But, uh, you know, that's
just how I like to do it.

05:22.599 --> 05:24.468
- If you take a break from your
day

05:24.501 --> 05:26.136
and you do something like this,

05:26.170 --> 05:28.272
you are more productive
at the end of the day

05:28.305 --> 05:29.372
than working straight through.

05:29.405 --> 05:31.007
So, like a half-hour, we always
say

05:31.040 --> 05:33.043
that doing something
lighthearted like this,

05:33.077 --> 05:34.979
and that's why we're successful.

05:35.012 --> 05:36.545
That was the, that was the
exciting part

05:36.579 --> 05:37.546
I think, you know?

05:37.580 --> 05:38.481
This is definitely

05:38.514 --> 05:39.615
not the DMV.
- I don't know who they are,

05:39.648 --> 05:40.483
but they're, you know, we
share space with them, so.

05:40.516 --> 05:41.384
Yeah that was real
cool.

05:41.417 --> 05:43.120
So, like, what's your like
day-to-day,

05:43.153 --> 05:44.121
like what do u do?

05:44.154 --> 05:46.222
- Day-to-day, uh, one
of the main things I do

05:46.255 --> 05:47.490
is I sell the ad space.

05:47.523 --> 05:48.457
Now when we started Gigaler,

05:48.491 --> 05:49.658
we had banner ads, okay?

05:49.692 --> 05:51.360
We had banner ads that we click.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.296
Now it's more about pre-rolls.

05:53.329 --> 05:54.097
So I'm selling those.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.664
I'm getting clients to buy
those,

05:55.698 --> 05:57.466
which is keeping the lights on.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.435
But I'm also the idea man.

05:59.468 --> 06:01.569
- I identify the needs of our
customers.

06:01.603 --> 06:03.739
I create a product that
fulfills those needs.

06:03.772 --> 06:07.110
And I do it with humility and
confidence.

06:07.143 --> 06:09.644
And that is what people, uh, uh,

06:09.677 --> 06:12.114
expect me to do day-to-day at
this job.

06:12.147 --> 06:14.150
And I think I do it pretty well.

06:14.183 --> 06:15.618
I think, uh, uh, our success

06:15.651 --> 06:17.552
speaks for itself.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.386
Yeah, it's great.
- Why, why do you guys

06:18.420 --> 06:19.754
live together?

06:19.787 --> 06:22.724
- Well, Tom's been over for now
six,

06:22.757 --> 06:23.591
six months?
- Yeah.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.693
It's, if it's not exactly six
months,

06:25.727 --> 06:27.162
it's, it's close, yeah.

06:27.195 --> 06:27.829
When was that?
- Yeah.

06:27.862 --> 06:30.065
Uh, August, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.233
- Yeah.
- Wow, yeah.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.068
Do you guys
honestly live well together?

06:34.101 --> 06:36.371
Or is that something you
just say for the camera?

06:36.404 --> 06:37.339
- No.
- No.

06:37.372 --> 06:38.440
We gotta show, let's
show the screening room.

06:38.473 --> 06:40.441
- This is my favorite.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:40.474 --> 06:41.775
- This is my room.
- Yeah, definitely.

06:41.808 --> 06:43.410
This is
where the magic happens.

06:43.444 --> 06:46.048
This is where
we see different videos.

06:46.081 --> 06:48.715
We don't just watch
the videos on a laptop.

06:48.749 --> 06:49.883
We, we project them.

06:49.916 --> 06:50.817
They all go through here.
- Yeah, we try to make 'em--

06:50.851 --> 06:52.719
We watch them and we
review them

06:52.753 --> 06:54.655
and, uh, we see 'em on the
screen.

06:54.688 --> 06:55.790
Right off my system.

06:55.822 --> 06:56.457
Let's see if, uh,
people are in the offices.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.459
Here's Katy.
- Hi, Katy.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.128
- Hi!

07:03.530 --> 07:04.464
- He's good.

07:04.497 --> 07:06.367
Katy just
got married, she's--

07:06.400 --> 07:08.469
- I have an update on the
banner ads by the way.

07:08.502 --> 07:10.237
We, we talked, yeah.
- Okay.

07:10.271 --> 07:10.937
- This is Andrea.
- Andrea.

07:10.971 --> 07:12.105
Andrea curates videos

07:12.138 --> 07:13.073
for us.
- Hi, Andrea.

07:13.106 --> 07:14.107
- She finds videos.
- Andrea curates videos.

07:14.140 --> 07:17.411
But she also is our
fashionista of the office.

07:17.444 --> 07:19.646
- She curates videos, meaning
she finds the videos online

07:19.679 --> 07:21.047
that we're gonna put, you know,

07:21.081 --> 07:23.116
that we put on the site.
- Bye!

07:23.149 --> 07:24.084
- We gotta get a shot of Hank,
right here.

07:24.117 --> 07:25.051
Hank's our account.

07:25.085 --> 07:26.486
This guy,  this guy.

07:26.519 --> 07:27.588
- Gentlemen.
- Yeah, he's not

07:27.620 --> 07:28.754
the happiest guy in the world.

07:28.788 --> 07:30.256
This is important to get on
camera.

07:30.290 --> 07:33.293
This is, this is all Griffin's
design.

07:33.326 --> 07:34.827
You can see Griffin all
over this right here.

07:34.860 --> 07:35.561
This is his work.
- You know,

07:35.594 --> 07:36.561
it was like patriotic.
- Yeah.

07:36.595 --> 07:38.564
No, it's very patriotic.
- I put, like, stars.

07:38.598 --> 07:40.200
We're missing the stripes
but you get the point.

07:40.233 --> 07:42.168
- No, it's good, it's good.
- Marketing,

07:42.202 --> 07:44.303
this is how we make money.

07:44.336 --> 07:45.804
Tell us about yourself.

07:45.837 --> 07:46.805
- Just tell, tell you about
myself?

07:46.838 --> 07:48.474
- Yeah, you're not gonna
hold the camera on me

07:48.508 --> 07:49.642
the whole time, are you?

07:49.675 --> 07:50.143
Well that's
the only way I'll, you know,

07:50.176 --> 07:51.144
agree to do this.

07:51.177 --> 07:52.111
Come on, just
put it a little lower.

07:52.144 --> 07:54.746
We wanna see your face.
- Okay, okay, okay.

07:54.779 --> 07:56.615
I'm gonna do somethg.

07:56.648 --> 07:58.651
I'm gonna take this camera from
you.

07:58.684 --> 08:00.152
We wanna see you, man.

08:00.185 --> 08:00.985
What do you do for the company?

08:01.019 --> 08:03.788
Tell us.
- My, I think my day-to-day

08:03.822 --> 08:07.691
is, you know, like I'm
in charge of what I,

08:07.725 --> 08:10.229
you know, frame as REM,

08:10.262 --> 08:11.430
which is not rapid eye movement,

08:11.463 --> 08:13.832
but it's, you know, research,

08:13.865 --> 08:16.434
and, um, engagement,

08:16.467 --> 08:17.301
and money.

08:17.335 --> 08:19.304
So, like, we have to, I have to,
like,

08:19.338 --> 08:21.740
research all of the content
that goes on the website,

08:21.773 --> 08:22.607
and I have to make sure that
people

08:22.641 --> 08:25.309
are actually engaging with the
content.

08:25.343 --> 08:27.445
And then the clicks equal cash.

08:27.478 --> 08:28.846
This is the nitty
gritty.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.215
- This is the not-fun floor.

08:30.249 --> 08:31.082
- Yeah.
- It's not as fun.

08:31.116 --> 08:31.882
I don't spend as much time up
here.

08:31.915 --> 08:33.517
This is where programming
happens.

08:33.551 --> 08:34.385
- Yeah, there's more
programming.

08:34.418 --> 08:35.419
Less, less--
- Sales.

08:35.453 --> 08:36.354
- Yeah, yeah.

08:36.386 --> 08:37.855
You know, programming is a huge
component

08:37.888 --> 08:39.422
of Gigaler now because we're
moving

08:39.456 --> 08:40.857
into that software algorithm,

08:40.890 --> 08:43.494
and, uh, it's exciting.
- My favorite place.

08:43.527 --> 08:45.796
- Yeah.
- My favorite place.

08:46.764 --> 08:49.166
- Oh, he's gettin' a call.
- The kitchen!

08:49.199 --> 08:50.401
- Um, I should take this,

08:50.434 --> 08:51.902
so can you guys just hold--
- Okay, sure.

08:51.935 --> 08:54.405
We're good to let him go?
- Chris, we'll see you later.

08:54.438 --> 08:55.738
- And I think, uh, we need,

08:55.772 --> 08:56.773
we need to introduce you to an
employee

08:56.806 --> 08:58.508
that I, I believe is,

08:58.541 --> 08:59.609
is quintessential to the company

08:59.642 --> 09:02.680
and, uh, is, is truly, you know,

09:02.713 --> 09:04.181
one of the most important key
players,

09:04.214 --> 09:07.817
and that is Griffin.

09:07.850 --> 09:09.286
- Welcome to my life.
- This is his.

09:09.319 --> 09:10.387
So this is my desk.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.189
This is my office.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.456
This is my vision board.

09:13.490 --> 09:14.357
This is what I'm doing.

09:14.391 --> 09:15.925
I like to read.
- Yeah.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.461
You know, a bunch
of, like, you know, magazines.

09:18.495 --> 09:19.928
That's my dog.
- Yeah.

09:19.961 --> 09:21.497
- He's so bad.

09:21.530 --> 09:22.865
You know, and then I.

09:22.899 --> 09:24.834
Did somebody put
chocolate milk on my desk?

09:24.867 --> 09:26.902
It was not--

09:26.935 --> 09:27.903
Everybody in this company knows

09:27.936 --> 09:28.837
that I hate chocolate milk,

09:28.870 --> 09:30.406
and so they like to just leave

09:30.439 --> 09:32.709
their disgusting milk cartons on
my desk.

09:32.742 --> 09:35.811
- I had no idea, no idea.
- I hate milk.

09:35.844 --> 09:38.747
There was a, an article that
was published about Gigaler,

09:38.780 --> 09:41.383
talking about its, its
infringement

09:41.417 --> 09:43.285
on people's right to privacy.

09:43.319 --> 09:44.186
No!

09:44.220 --> 09:45.887
You know, I mean, nothing
intentional.

09:45.921 --> 09:46.888
At the end of the day,

09:46.922 --> 09:49.458
remember that this was
started by Chris and I,

09:49.491 --> 09:50.791
um, to have fun.

09:50.825 --> 09:53.229
- I mean, you're getting to know
a website

09:53.262 --> 09:54.095
the more you visit it.

09:54.129 --> 09:55.597
Why shouldn't a website get to
know you

09:55.631 --> 09:57.366
at the same time?

09:57.399 --> 09:59.234
It's kind of my philosophy.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.336
Why is it a one-way street, you
know?

10:01.369 --> 10:03.305
If we're investing so much time,

10:03.339 --> 10:05.507
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

10:05.541 --> 10:07.308
into the Internet and into these
websites,

10:07.342 --> 10:09.444
then why shouldn't they
be investing in us?

10:09.477 --> 10:12.247
- We're tracking them to
make it a better site,

10:12.280 --> 10:14.350
and that's what they, you know,

10:14.383 --> 10:15.516
they don't have to go to the
site

10:15.550 --> 10:16.183
if they don't want to,

10:16.217 --> 10:17.218
but if they go to the site,

10:17.252 --> 10:19.554
they, they've kinda
understood that agreement,

10:19.587 --> 10:20.488
that we're gonna follow you,

10:20.521 --> 10:21.322
and we're gonna know what you
wanna see.

10:21.356 --> 10:22.922
- You choose to come to our
website.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.325
We're not finding you.

10:24.359 --> 10:25.192
We wanna help you,

10:25.226 --> 10:26.694
we wanna make your experience
better.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.329
We wanna, we wanna give you

10:28.363 --> 10:30.897
a, a, an individual relationship

10:30.930 --> 10:32.266
to our homepage.
- It's the reason

10:32.299 --> 10:32.932
these lights are on.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.000
The reason you have a job

10:34.033 --> 10:35.870
and I'm paying your salary

10:35.903 --> 10:38.572
is because of clicks and
eyeballs.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.374
Clicks, meaning people clicking
on things.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.809
Eyeballs, meaning the hits
that we're getting on the site.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.844
Clicks and eyeballs are,
at the end of the day,

10:44.878 --> 10:46.381
all that matter.
- You know, so many people

10:46.414 --> 10:47.247
call it traffic.

10:47.281 --> 10:48.848
I, I, I prefer patrons.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.584
You know, the patrons of our
website,

10:50.617 --> 10:52.386
each one has an individual
homepage

10:52.419 --> 10:54.720
that greets them based on their,

10:54.753 --> 10:56.990
uh, uh, uh, uh, user history

10:57.023 --> 10:57.691
and their cookies,

10:57.724 --> 11:00.494
and, uh, and, uh, and, and, uh,

11:00.527 --> 11:02.595
their, their web, um, um,

11:05.664 --> 11:06.700
their web use.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.369
- So let's, uh, take a look at,
uh,

11:09.403 --> 11:12.505
uh, my right-hand man,
Tom's right-hand man.

11:12.538 --> 11:14.607
Chris' right-hand man.
- Time out for one second.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.674
I, I have to go.

11:15.708 --> 11:16.743
You can handle this at this
point.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.744
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay, all right, so good.

11:17.777 --> 11:21.714
- See, um, you know, the
company right-hand man.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.018
Abbi.

11:30.055 --> 11:33.058
She will literally sit here all
day

11:33.091 --> 11:34.359
and not move.

11:40.799 --> 11:42.734
I feel like I'm spying on
her, it's getting awkward.

11:42.767 --> 11:43.635
Abbi.

11:46.738 --> 11:47.606
Hello!

11:56.448 --> 11:58.450
- Um, she's shy.

11:58.483 --> 11:59.651
She doesn't like to be on
camera.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.386
She's--
- Okay, I'm not shy.

12:01.419 --> 12:02.987
- Sorry, she's inner,
introverted.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.121
She gave me that note last week.

12:04.155 --> 12:06.390
Introverted, she, she doesn't
like to be called shy.

12:06.423 --> 12:08.493
Okay, wave to the camera.

12:09.394 --> 12:12.029
Abbi's doing programming work.
- Hi, guys.

12:12.063 --> 12:14.365
- Happy birthday, Abbi.

12:14.398 --> 12:15.932
- It's, no.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.501
No, guys, it's not my birthday.

12:17.534 --> 12:18.335
It's like my thing.

12:18.369 --> 12:21.072
What's your, like, what's your
job?

12:21.105 --> 12:23.340
- Uh, okay, so my overall job

12:23.374 --> 12:25.442
is, uh, to build the, um,

12:26.777 --> 12:30.447
the foundation, um, meaning
the software and everything.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.082
Uh, the way that Gigaler works.

12:32.115 --> 12:33.917
And we have this unique concept

12:33.950 --> 12:36.353
of, um, this really streamlined,

12:36.387 --> 12:39.589
customized, uh, content
presentation for the user.

12:39.623 --> 12:40.957
I've sort of, um,

12:41.892 --> 12:43.560
always been interested in that,

12:43.594 --> 12:46.462
in making technology more
personal and more useful.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.931
Um, technology should
make life easier, so.

12:48.964 --> 12:51.368
Tom is more like a tornado,

12:52.536 --> 12:54.570
and Chris is more of a
hurricane.

12:54.604 --> 12:57.407
Um, Tom can just walk into a
room

12:58.674 --> 13:01.077
and cause just absolute mayhem,

13:01.111 --> 13:02.445
just wreak total havoc

13:02.478 --> 13:04.780
upon everybody's creative
process,

13:04.814 --> 13:07.116
and then we all come
out the better for it.

13:07.149 --> 13:08.784
Chris is like a quiet storm.

13:08.818 --> 13:11.887
He's definitely, um, he takes
his time.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.657
He lets everything fully process

13:14.690 --> 13:16.025
before he reaches decisions on
it,

13:16.058 --> 13:17.859
which is, um, a little bit more
similar

13:17.892 --> 13:18.893
to the way that I operate,

13:18.927 --> 13:21.597
so I identified more with Chris

13:21.631 --> 13:23.666
upon first meeting them both.

13:23.699 --> 13:25.534
Um, I don't know, I joked once,

13:25.567 --> 13:26.401
and they've never let me forget
it,

13:26.435 --> 13:28.503
that first I wanted to work at
Gigaler

13:28.537 --> 13:30.104
and then I wanted to work for
Chris.

13:30.138 --> 13:31.874
What do you hope is
the future

13:31.907 --> 13:35.143
of the company?
- Gigaler, in three years,

13:35.176 --> 13:38.680
uh, 30% of our users have us as
homepage.

13:38.713 --> 13:40.014
Uh, that is the ultimate goal.

13:40.048 --> 13:42.617
We are people's first connection

13:42.651 --> 13:43.985
when they turn on their
computer,

13:44.018 --> 13:45.954
when they go on to the Internet.

13:45.987 --> 13:47.889
- An old friend of mine, uh, eh,

13:47.922 --> 13:49.157
that was a motivational speaker,

13:49.190 --> 13:51.659
did a motivational-speaking kind
of tour,

13:51.692 --> 13:54.028
uh, said why aren't there
rich people, millionaires,

13:54.062 --> 13:54.963
everywhere?

13:54.996 --> 13:57.131
And he said 'cause people have
bug buts.

13:57.165 --> 13:58.732
And he didn't mean their rear
end.

13:58.766 --> 14:01.669
What he meant was, he meant the
word but.

14:01.702 --> 14:04.639
I wanna be a doctor, but
it's a lot of, uh, hard work.

14:04.673 --> 14:07.140
Uh, I wanna be an actor, but I'm
too shy.

14:07.174 --> 14:08.742
Um, any of the.

14:08.776 --> 14:10.177
The bottom line is, he said

14:10.210 --> 14:12.179
all that you have to
do is change one word.

14:12.212 --> 14:14.214
You have to change but to and.

14:14.247 --> 14:16.584
I am an and person, I don't have
any buts.

14:16.617 --> 14:19.152
I want to make Gigaler into
a billion dollar company,

14:19.186 --> 14:20.287
but I'm afraid.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.889
I wanna make Gigaler into
a billion dollar company,

14:22.922 --> 14:25.526
and I'm afraid, and we're gonna
do it,

14:25.559 --> 14:28.095
and watch us on the
cover of Time magazine.

14:35.202 --> 14:38.471
- So I just found an amazing
video.

14:38.505 --> 14:40.139
Someone submitted it to me,

14:40.172 --> 14:42.441
um, about 10 minutes ago.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.645
Uh, I wanna show Tom.

14:45.678 --> 14:46.813
I think he's gonna love it.

14:46.846 --> 14:48.147
It's totally why I do my job,

14:48.180 --> 14:49.982
so if he hates it,

14:50.016 --> 14:51.017
then I quit.

14:52.251 --> 14:52.984
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.786
- Hi, um.

14:54.820 --> 14:57.089
I want you to see something.

14:58.124 --> 14:59.659
Have a seat.
- Okay.

14:59.692 --> 15:01.627
- Yeah.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.563
- Uh, I want you to decide what
you think.

15:04.596 --> 15:06.533
- Okay.
- Just hit play.

15:55.780 --> 15:56.680
Do you love that?

15:56.713 --> 15:57.748
- That was awesome.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.216
- Yeah, that was awesome.

15:59.249 --> 16:00.017
Oh, man.

16:00.050 --> 16:01.586
That's gotta go up in the
banner.

16:01.619 --> 16:02.452
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay,

16:02.486 --> 16:03.554
so it's good.
- We gotta get Chris.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.788
- Let's go take it to Chris.
- We gotta get Chris.

16:04.821 --> 16:06.823
- Let's go take it to Chris.
- And play it totally serious.

16:06.856 --> 16:07.624
Be like this is a--
- He's gonna shit himself.

16:07.657 --> 16:08.492
- Yeah, we'll be like, all
right,

16:08.525 --> 16:09.159
this is somethin' we gotta talk
about.

16:09.193 --> 16:09.860
Yeah, like you.

16:09.894 --> 16:10.961
- All the phrases--
- Chris.

16:10.995 --> 16:12.762
So it's, like,
yeah, I'm just on the phone

16:12.796 --> 16:13.897
with Stacy, so, um, so it's like
a,

16:13.930 --> 16:15.331
so, so I'm talking about tags

16:15.364 --> 16:18.201
that make a larger context, uh,
uh,

16:18.234 --> 16:19.870
instead of just like, you know,

16:19.904 --> 16:22.271
ghosts or like, uh, you know.

16:22.305 --> 16:23.206
- Chris, it's important.

16:23.239 --> 16:25.675
This is important, we have to
take this.

16:25.709 --> 16:26.910
- No, I know, but.

16:26.943 --> 16:28.877
Can we not, can we not film when
I'm?

16:28.911 --> 16:29.813
No, no, no, this is
serious.

16:29.846 --> 16:31.147
You gotta check this out.

16:31.180 --> 16:31.815
Here, sit down.

16:31.848 --> 16:32.749
We got this video submitted,

16:32.782 --> 16:36.952
and we do not know what to make
of it, so.

16:36.985 --> 16:38.220
- But I.

16:40.023 --> 16:41.290
- What am I gonna--
- Shh.

16:41.324 --> 16:42.158
- Well just check it out.

16:42.191 --> 16:43.026
- Just pay attention.
- You gotta pay

16:43.059 --> 16:44.060
attention here.

16:55.671 --> 16:56.538
I'm so sorry.

16:57.840 --> 17:00.643
Did you spill coffee on
yourself

17:00.676 --> 17:02.210
I, I'm sorry.

17:02.244 --> 17:04.880
Look, the only defense.

17:04.913 --> 17:05.848
- Woo!

17:05.881 --> 17:06.714
- All right, hang on, Abbi,

17:06.749 --> 17:09.215
I'm texting Abbi that.
- You bastards.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.853
- It was worse than I thought.

17:10.886 --> 17:12.054
- I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

17:12.087 --> 17:13.355
All right, hang on.
- Yeah.

17:13.387 --> 17:15.758
Hey, hey, Abbi, we
gotta talk about a video

17:15.790 --> 17:17.023
that was submitted to us.
- Yeah.

17:17.058 --> 17:18.125
Could you come
in and check it out?

17:18.159 --> 17:19.093
Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:19.126 --> 17:21.997
- We all wanna kinda
discuss it afterwards.

17:22.030 --> 17:23.365
Well, here, come on, sit.

17:23.397 --> 17:25.299
I, I would like to schedule a
conference

17:25.332 --> 17:27.034
after this to talk about this.

17:27.068 --> 17:30.171
I mean, it's crazy to get
this kinda thing submitted.

17:30.204 --> 17:31.038
- Okay.

17:31.072 --> 17:32.606
Uh, yeah.

17:42.684 --> 17:43.384
Oh!

17:46.320 --> 17:49.723
- That should be like
left banner, uh, like go.

17:49.756 --> 17:51.024
Right?
- I vote homepage.

17:51.057 --> 17:53.027
- Homepage, guys.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.896
- Yeah.

17:54.929 --> 17:56.997
We need homepage from you.
- He's in a state of shock.

17:57.898 --> 17:58.965
Say homepage.
- It's on the homepage.

17:58.999 --> 18:00.934
- But say it to the camera.
- It's on the homepage.

18:00.967 --> 18:02.804
- Homepage to the camera.
- The camera.

18:02.837 --> 18:03.937
- Say it right there.
- Goes on the homepage.

18:03.970 --> 18:05.038
Go for it, Abb.

18:09.442 --> 18:12.311
Obviously, this is not gonna
be the typical hour meeting.

18:12.344 --> 18:13.947
Okay, I know everybody's
phones are going off.

18:13.980 --> 18:15.415
I just ask, just put 'em on
vibrate,

18:15.448 --> 18:18.018
just put 'em on silent
for five minutes, okay?

18:18.051 --> 18:20.085
All right, we have a huge video.

18:20.119 --> 18:21.353
Okay, and we all know this.

18:21.386 --> 18:22.922
And we're all, yeah,
give a round of applause.

18:22.955 --> 18:24.157
Fine, huge video, huge video.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.227
But, but, but, but

18:28.260 --> 18:30.796
if we don't capitalize on that
video,

18:30.830 --> 18:31.797
we're nowhere, okay?

18:31.831 --> 18:32.464
So here's what I wanna do.

18:32.497 --> 18:33.966
First off, don't laugh,

18:33.999 --> 18:35.868
I just want everybody to
hold hands real quick.

18:35.901 --> 18:36.869
Come on, join hands.

18:36.902 --> 18:38.370
Okay, just close your eyes,

18:38.403 --> 18:39.805
and I want ya to just,

18:39.839 --> 18:41.707
this excitement, this
feeling that you have,

18:41.741 --> 18:42.775
this happy energy,

18:42.808 --> 18:44.375
I just want ya to hold
on to it for a little bit

18:44.408 --> 18:47.079
and just think, this
is the way Gigaler.com

18:47.112 --> 18:48.180
is going to be.

18:48.213 --> 18:49.348
Okay, from now on, this is the
way

18:49.381 --> 18:50.449
it's always gonna be.

18:50.482 --> 18:53.451
Just hold that in your head
for just a second, okay?

18:53.484 --> 18:54.285
Okay, Abbi, just,
like,

18:54.318 --> 18:55.254
explain what's happening right
now.

18:55.287 --> 18:58.057
- Okay, so, right now, we are
dealing with

18:58.090 --> 19:00.358
a lot more traffic than we are
used to.

19:00.391 --> 19:01.292
Have you ever
seen anything like this?

19:01.325 --> 19:03.427
- I have never, Griffin, I've
never seen

19:03.461 --> 19:04.628
anything like this, this is
insane.

19:04.662 --> 19:07.066
Obviously, we're gonna
move the software forward

19:07.099 --> 19:09.367
much quicker now because
we have information.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.435
- Everyone knows we've just
been keeping the website stable.

19:11.469 --> 19:12.270
We've been increasing the
bandwidth,

19:12.303 --> 19:14.172
and we are going to drop this,
uh,

19:14.205 --> 19:17.776
program into our site
within the next week or so.

19:17.809 --> 19:19.310
Joe is actually, I
think, working right now

19:19.343 --> 19:21.880
just to fix the bugs
and, I think, glitches.

19:21.913 --> 19:23.947
And, uh, I think that we're
gonna be

19:23.981 --> 19:25.883
all a-go, all ships forward.

19:25.916 --> 19:29.788
And we are gonna drop some
magic for you all soon.

19:29.821 --> 19:32.422
Audiences at home, stay tuned.

19:32.455 --> 19:33.390
Bring him
in, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.959
- Hello.
- Hello, Tom, welcome.

19:35.993 --> 19:37.495
All-star day.
- Hi.

19:39.063 --> 19:39.696
This is awesome.

19:39.729 --> 19:41.098
Well, I got some news, okay?

19:41.131 --> 19:43.767
I'm not gonna say which studio,

19:43.801 --> 19:46.136
but a major movie studio
contacted me,

19:46.169 --> 19:48.038
and said they want to
potentially screen

19:48.071 --> 19:49.039
exclusive trailers on our site.

19:49.072 --> 19:49.907
- Yeah.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.308
Giglar gets exclusive
content?

19:51.341 --> 19:52.275
- Yep, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:52.309 --> 19:52.642
I don't wanna say it
in front of the camera,

19:52.675 --> 19:54.177
but yeah.

19:54.211 --> 19:55.477
Hoo, big day, big day.

19:55.511 --> 19:56.278
- Drinks tonight!
- Yep.

19:56.312 --> 19:57.079
- Drinks tonight.
- Yep, whisky,

19:57.113 --> 19:58.849
whiskys on ice.
- We're goin' out

19:58.882 --> 19:59.716
to the Mud Show

19:59.749 --> 20:02.119
for margaritas.
- Surprise, surprise.

20:02.152 --> 20:03.119
- The problem is that there's,

20:03.152 --> 20:04.520
there's all kinds of viral sites

20:04.553 --> 20:06.322
that are, that are poppin' up
our video.

20:06.355 --> 20:08.025
I mean, they're not getting
the hits we're getting,

20:08.058 --> 20:08.859
but they're poppin' it up,

20:08.892 --> 20:10.027
and we need to put a stop to
that.

20:10.060 --> 20:10.994
That's, you know.

20:13.529 --> 20:16.065
- I just got another email, holy
shit.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.266
You got another?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.501
- Yeah.

20:18.535 --> 20:20.302
Wait, what's going on?

20:20.336 --> 20:21.570
- Uh, hang on, hang on.
- Just run outta the room

20:21.603 --> 20:23.272
why don't you?

20:23.305 --> 20:24.340
- We got another video.
- Chris!

20:24.373 --> 20:25.341
- We got another video.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:25.374 --> 20:26.375
Get in here.

20:26.408 --> 20:27.976
Abbi, get in here.
- I'll be right back, sorry.

20:28.009 --> 20:28.945
Yeah, sure, sure.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.347
- We have another video
from the same user.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.415
- Quick, quick, quick,
quick, quick, quick, quick!

20:33.449 --> 20:34.383
- Okay.

20:34.416 --> 20:35.550
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:37.185 --> 20:38.386
Same.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.076
- Dude, these are fantastic.

21:01.109 --> 21:03.411
Here, can you scrub and find
that face?

21:03.444 --> 21:04.445
Get to this whacky.

21:04.479 --> 21:05.346
Look at that thing.
- Whoa, go back, go back,

21:05.380 --> 21:07.381
go back, go back.
- Look at that face.

21:07.414 --> 21:09.616
- Right there.
- Freeze, right there.

21:09.649 --> 21:11.386
Sorry,
movin' it back and forth.

21:11.419 --> 21:13.588
Here we go.
- Go back.

21:13.621 --> 21:14.688
Yeah, look at that.

21:14.721 --> 21:16.857
Hey, wait, camera, get this,

21:16.891 --> 21:17.724
- Mark.
- That is awesome.

21:17.757 --> 21:18.993
He's got disgusting
teeth.

21:19.026 --> 21:20.260
Who is that, Mark?

21:20.294 --> 21:21.196
- Is that makeup, is that
makeup,

21:21.229 --> 21:23.030
or is that a mask?
- It's clearly makeup.

21:23.063 --> 21:24.064
- You can't even see his eye.

21:24.098 --> 21:24.965
Well you can see the right eye.

21:24.999 --> 21:26.133
- Yeah, his eyes look pulled
back, wow.

21:27.301 --> 21:29.136
Can you track it?
- Yeah, of course.

21:29.169 --> 21:30.537
- We find out who's making these
things,

21:30.570 --> 21:32.940
this, Chris, this is the time to
pay.

21:32.973 --> 21:35.242
We need exclusivity on these.

21:35.275 --> 21:36.176
Abbi, can you do it

21:36.210 --> 21:37.011
in 45 minutes?
- This is, this, this is,

21:37.044 --> 21:37.711
this is the time, this is the
time

21:37.744 --> 21:39.112
that we pay.
- Okay, hang on.

21:39.145 --> 21:39.979
Get that on camera.

21:40.013 --> 21:40.746
I never thought I'd hear those
words

21:40.779 --> 21:41.680
from him.
- This is the time.

21:41.714 --> 21:42.416
- This is the time we pay.
- It's the time

21:42.449 --> 21:43.117
we should pay.
- 'Kay, come on.

21:43.150 --> 21:45.185
We reconvene, what, in an hour?

21:45.219 --> 21:46.153
- Iwe can't, uh, yeah, yeah,
we'll,

21:46.186 --> 21:47.286
we'll just drop some numbers

21:47.320 --> 21:48.621
and then we'll--
- Abbi, I just sent it.

21:48.654 --> 21:50.056
- Abbi, change of plan.

21:50.089 --> 21:53.360
Obviously, get on the
IP, thank ya very much.

21:53.393 --> 21:54.894
You're amazing.

21:54.928 --> 21:57.030
Thank you, Griffin.
- Okay, anonymous.

21:57.063 --> 21:59.198
- See you.

22:00.934 --> 22:04.537
- There are two ways to submit
videos to Gigaler, okay?

22:04.570 --> 22:07.440
So there's like a, you
know, lemme show ya.

22:07.473 --> 22:08.942
You wanna submit a video,

22:08.975 --> 22:11.509
basically you can fill
out this whole form,

22:11.543 --> 22:14.347
and, like, submit a
user-submitted video

22:14.380 --> 22:15.148
so we know who you are.

22:15.181 --> 22:18.084
We know it is Gene Smith's
video,

22:18.117 --> 22:21.954
and she can, you know,
she fills out the form,

22:21.987 --> 22:23.188
we figure out that it's you.

22:23.221 --> 22:25.258
Uh, and then we can track you.

22:25.291 --> 22:26.925
And number two is that you can
do

22:26.959 --> 22:28.293
an anonymous submission

22:28.326 --> 22:29.527
where you don't tell us your
name,

22:29.561 --> 22:31.196
and you just submit a video.

22:31.229 --> 22:32.630
Why'd ya wanna do that, I don't
know,

22:32.664 --> 22:34.299
but people do it.

22:34.332 --> 22:36.268
Um, but if you're anonymous,

22:36.301 --> 22:39.404
then we are supposed to
not be able to track you.

22:39.437 --> 22:42.273
But the truth is we can track
you.

22:42.306 --> 22:44.008
I just have to call Abbi.

22:44.041 --> 22:45.143
And Abbi can look you up.

22:45.177 --> 22:47.379
She'll find out all your shit.

22:47.412 --> 22:49.247
So we're gonna have

22:49.281 --> 22:51.715
all of the information we
need in about 20 minutes

22:51.748 --> 22:52.984
if Abbi's on her game.

22:53.017 --> 22:55.153
If she's not on her game, 25
minutes.

22:55.187 --> 22:56.088
'Kay?

22:58.355 --> 23:00.992
Yes, Karen, I would love to do
that.

23:01.025 --> 23:04.161
I would love to have a lunch
with you.

23:04.195 --> 23:05.630
Yeah, no, I think it, no,

23:05.663 --> 23:08.265
I know it's been crazy
.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.734
- It's been really

23:10.767 --> 23:11.535
easy.

23:11.568 --> 23:13.204
They gave us pretty much
everything

23:13.237 --> 23:14.370
I needed to find 'em,

23:14.404 --> 23:16.173
just by sending us two different
files,

23:16.207 --> 23:17.408
which are both original content,

23:17.441 --> 23:19.176
which is amazing, so

23:20.211 --> 23:21.978
kinda looks like these guys
wanna be found

23:22.012 --> 23:23.313
right now, to be honest.

23:23.346 --> 23:25.081
I'm doing a little bit of data
mining,

23:25.115 --> 23:27.751
which basically just means
tracking your IP addresses,

23:27.784 --> 23:28.986
basic stuff.

23:29.020 --> 23:31.154
And it looks like I've got

23:32.188 --> 23:33.189
what I need.

23:33.223 --> 23:34.257
Okay, cool.

23:34.290 --> 23:36.059
So it's looking like our videos

23:36.092 --> 23:37.994
are coming from

23:38.028 --> 23:39.996
Bloomfield, New York.

23:43.766 --> 23:45.168
Griffin, I have your address.

23:45.201 --> 23:46.035
Huh?

23:46.068 --> 23:47.470
- I've got your address.

23:47.503 --> 23:48.638
Yeah.

23:49.672 --> 23:51.474
- Abbi strikes again!

23:53.576 --> 23:54.609
Tell me somethin'.
- Okay.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.445
- Tell me somethin' good.
- So I've got an address

23:56.478 --> 23:57.347
and a phone number for you.

23:57.380 --> 23:59.615
Phone number appears to be a
landline.

23:59.649 --> 24:00.716
The number's been around for a
while.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.084
Hey, Mark, can you
hold,

24:02.117 --> 24:03.018
can you hold?
- Yep, got it.

24:03.052 --> 24:04.353
- Go ahead.
- So we've got

24:04.386 --> 24:05.654
address and phone number right
now.

24:05.687 --> 24:08.124
The town appears to be
Bloomfield.

24:08.158 --> 24:08.991
- You're a genius.

24:09.025 --> 24:12.094
This why we hired you, you're so
good.

24:12.127 --> 24:14.196
Now let me see.
- Bloomfield, New York.

24:14.229 --> 24:15.430
Where we at?

24:15.464 --> 24:18.167
- Looking like a Rochester

24:18.200 --> 24:19.134
area.
- Rochester, oh.

24:19.168 --> 24:20.469
Cute, I have family up there.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.371
- You know what, we should go
get, uh,

24:22.404 --> 24:23.772
Tom and Chris.

24:23.805 --> 24:25.040
- Okay.
- Mark, follow, follow,

24:25.074 --> 24:26.307
follow, follow, follow.
- All right.

24:26.340 --> 24:27.675
Move!

24:32.447 --> 24:34.082
- Griff, here's this.

24:34.115 --> 24:36.117
All right, just, uh.

24:36.150 --> 24:38.119
- Yeah, shh, shh.

24:55.803 --> 24:56.670
Voicemail.

25:02.210 --> 25:05.445
- Uh, yes, hi, this is, uh,
Tom Brennan from Gigaler.com.

25:05.478 --> 25:07.647
Uh, who am I speaking with?

25:12.386 --> 25:15.088
- Uh, from, we're from
Gigaler.com.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.257
Uh, you submitted a video to us.

25:17.290 --> 25:22.129
And, uh, actually the
number was in the metadata.

25:22.162 --> 25:22.829
Uh huh.

25:26.599 --> 25:28.201
What is your name?

25:30.236 --> 25:31.371
- Tara, hi.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.340
Okay, um, Tara.
- Mm hmm.

25:33.373 --> 25:34.507
- Call 'em back later.

25:34.541 --> 25:36.476
Uh, are you, were you the person

25:36.509 --> 25:37.609
responsible for making the,

25:37.643 --> 25:40.712
the videos that were submitted
to us?

25:44.184 --> 25:46.385
- Oh great, great, well, um,

25:46.418 --> 25:48.387
the reason we're calling
is we would love to see,

25:48.420 --> 25:49.555
I mean, we love what you're
doing.

25:49.588 --> 25:50.422
We love what you're making.

25:50.456 --> 25:52.325
We would like to see if we can
set up

25:52.359 --> 25:53.859
some type of exclusive deal

25:53.892 --> 25:56.695
where you would only be
able to air the videos

25:56.728 --> 25:58.330
on, on Gigaler,

25:58.364 --> 26:00.766
and any future videos
would come to us directly.

26:00.799 --> 26:02.601
Does that make sense?

26:11.476 --> 26:12.277
- Yes.

26:12.310 --> 26:14.446
And, um, what we're talking
about

26:14.480 --> 26:15.781
is actually paying you,

26:15.814 --> 26:17.548
actually giving you money

26:17.582 --> 26:19.450
so that any future videos

26:19.484 --> 26:21.219
come to us and us only.

26:21.252 --> 26:23.222
So you, they can't be aired
anywhere else.

26:23.255 --> 26:24.790
Do, do you get that?

26:34.832 --> 26:36.167
- Okay, so you have a partner
involved.

26:36.201 --> 26:38.603
And who's, who is the partner?

26:55.686 --> 26:57.554
Um, maybe we can talk at a
different time.

26:57.587 --> 26:59.389
It may not be a perfect time for
you.

26:59.423 --> 27:01.625
Um, and, can I give you my phone
number,

27:01.658 --> 27:06.330
and perhaps we can talk at
a different time about this?

27:06.363 --> 27:08.498
- Sure, sure, okay, it's 2-1-6

27:08.532 --> 27:09.666
2-2-0-9-7-8-1.

27:13.836 --> 27:15.705
- Okay, uh, so hopefully we can
do a deal

27:15.739 --> 27:17.241
and so some, oh, she hung up.

27:19.243 --> 27:20.876
Well that's exactly the way
I was hoping that would go.

27:20.909 --> 27:21.744
That's exactly--
Well that went,

27:21.777 --> 27:23.178
that went well.

27:24.780 --> 27:25.782
- Get that on camera,

27:25.815 --> 27:28.451
as how good a sales
call, that's right, baby.

27:28.484 --> 27:29.852
That's, should be the training
sales call.

27:29.885 --> 27:31.387
You can even say no.

27:32.721 --> 27:33.756
You should've said that.

27:34.590 --> 27:36.492
- I have no idea.

27:42.431 --> 27:43.799
- Okay, okay.

27:43.832 --> 27:45.533
Uh, hello there.

27:45.567 --> 27:46.969
So, it's like

27:47.002 --> 27:48.604
ten or so at night,

27:48.637 --> 27:51.774
and, uh, Tara has just called
Tom

27:51.807 --> 27:53.508
on his cellphone,

27:53.541 --> 27:56.244
and they've been talking
for, like, five minutes,

27:56.278 --> 27:58.681
and, uh, so I turned my phone on

27:58.714 --> 28:00.515
so we could see what happens,
okay?

28:00.548 --> 28:01.416
Let me ask you this,

28:01.449 --> 28:03.985
are you--
- He's like really into it.

28:04.018 --> 28:05.287
All right, Griffin, you're
welcome.

28:05.320 --> 28:05.987
Ready.

28:14.061 --> 28:14.729
- Okay.

28:14.762 --> 28:15.430
I don't know what that means.

28:15.463 --> 28:16.630
It depends on how we look at it,

28:16.663 --> 28:17.531
but, uh.

28:19.033 --> 28:22.470
So, you mentioned you had, uh,

28:22.504 --> 28:24.005
somebody else last time.

28:24.038 --> 28:26.006
What was his name again?

28:28.343 --> 28:29.010
- Francis.

28:30.378 --> 28:32.313
- He sounds so suave, doesn't
he?

28:32.346 --> 28:34.948
- He's like,

28:34.981 --> 28:38.385
he's like in his, like, Macho
Man mode.

28:40.587 --> 28:41.622
- Okay, oh, all right.

28:41.655 --> 28:42.789
So he's your business partner.

28:42.823 --> 28:43.824
Okay.

28:43.857 --> 28:44.725
And, uh.

28:46.727 --> 28:47.628
- Okay.

28:47.661 --> 28:48.294
Kind of.

28:48.328 --> 28:50.831
Well, it's, uh, do you live,

28:50.864 --> 28:52.666
do you live with him?

28:56.902 --> 28:58.070
- Oh, okay.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.640
They live together.

28:59.673 --> 29:01.608
Um, okay.
- They live together.

29:01.642 --> 29:04.076
The plot thickens.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.911
Will Tom prevail?
- Well lemme ask you this.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.514
I mean, what does he think
about the exclusive content,

29:08.548 --> 29:11.618
uh, you know, in, in, in doing,
yeah?

29:14.854 --> 29:16.622
- It's complicated.

29:16.656 --> 29:17.523
Hmm.

29:21.461 --> 29:23.028
- I understand completely.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.430
But, you know, at the same time,

29:24.464 --> 29:26.332
I'm glad we're talking.

29:26.366 --> 29:30.301
And, uh, I, I will say
that I love your accent.

29:33.573 --> 29:35.107
Are you, uh,

29:35.140 --> 29:37.442
are you from London?

29:37.476 --> 29:39.444
Yeah, look at
that, that's your ball shot.

29:44.148 --> 29:45.950
- You're from London.

29:45.984 --> 29:46.851
Yeah.

29:48.052 --> 29:51.423
I was feeling this
much less.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.991
- Oh no, no, we don't have
to talk about that at all.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.093
I was, I was just bringing
up your voice, that's all.

29:55.126 --> 29:55.894
That's all I was doing,

29:55.927 --> 29:58.029
was just bringing up your
accent.

29:58.062 --> 30:01.699
- I was just bringing
up your beautiful voice.

30:01.732 --> 30:02.901
- I have a beautiful voice.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.403
That's very sweet.

30:04.436 --> 30:05.637
That, that's really flattering.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.805
She said.

30:07.838 --> 30:08.706
Oh shit.

30:16.547 --> 30:18.416
- Francis coming back and he
can't know

30:18.449 --> 30:20.451
that we're on the phone?

30:23.021 --> 30:24.054
- Okay, okay.

30:24.087 --> 30:26.557
Uh, but when can I expect
another call from you?

30:26.590 --> 30:28.158
Is there another time that's,
that works,

30:28.191 --> 30:29.727
that we could, uh, she hung up.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.528
- No!
- I just heard the

30:30.561 --> 30:32.995
beep, beep, beep.
- No, no, no!

30:33.029 --> 30:34.131
- Oh my God.

30:34.164 --> 30:35.999
- Dude!

30:36.033 --> 30:37.000
Francis is coming.

30:37.034 --> 30:39.102
I can't be on the phone
with you right now, Tom.

30:39.136 --> 30:41.070
Please call me back later.

30:41.103 --> 30:43.840
Please, call me back, get a new
number.

30:43.874 --> 30:46.877
- Yeah, that was, that was
whacky, that was whacky.

30:46.910 --> 30:49.879
If she's the girl in the video,
I'm in.

30:49.912 --> 30:51.414
I mean, that, that girl's hot.

30:51.448 --> 30:52.582
She's got the British accent.

30:52.615 --> 30:55.152
Uh, that's that's--
- British accent!

30:55.185 --> 30:57.019
Number one.
- Yeah, that was awesome.

30:57.053 --> 30:58.455
But, you know how, you know--

30:58.488 --> 30:59.422
- She was nice to you,

30:59.456 --> 30:59.989
she wanted to talk.
- No, but she, it ain't,

31:00.022 --> 31:01.691
it ain't, it ain't her.

31:01.724 --> 31:02.992
It's, 'cause she said, I asked
her,

31:03.025 --> 31:04.426
are you, are you the girl in the
video,

31:04.460 --> 31:06.162
and she says, well, it depends,

31:06.195 --> 31:07.664
which means--

31:07.697 --> 31:09.432
- That means she's 65, 70.

31:09.466 --> 31:10.733
She's got half her teeth.
- So we've got

31:10.767 --> 31:12.534
a cat purse happening.
- And she's 350 pounds.

31:12.568 --> 31:13.769
Yeah, that's what it means.

31:13.802 --> 31:15.003
- So like, you're gonna have,
like,

31:15.036 --> 31:16.172
a long correspondence with here,

31:16.205 --> 31:17.406
and you're gonna, like, go,

31:17.440 --> 31:20.075
well maybe I'm like, I'm like
flying near where you live,

31:20.108 --> 31:21.176
maybe I should drive over

31:21.209 --> 31:22.744
and we can say hi to your
horses.

31:22.778 --> 31:25.547
- It's gonna be this big
gigantic woman.

31:25.582 --> 31:27.783
Get this, first off,
enough with the camera.

31:27.816 --> 31:29.050
Get it off me for a second.

31:29.084 --> 31:30.418
This, this is.

31:31.119 --> 31:31.753
Is this real?

31:31.787 --> 31:33.522
I mean, like what the hell?

31:33.555 --> 31:35.089
I mean, that doesn't seem--
- You're the one

31:35.122 --> 31:37.125
who just talked to her for like

31:37.158 --> 31:38.894
eight minutes or so.
- Yeah, I talked to her

31:38.927 --> 31:39.828
and she said she had to go

31:39.861 --> 31:40.796
'cause Francis was coming.

31:40.829 --> 31:42.564
I mean, what the hell?
- Yeah, man, I mean,

31:42.598 --> 31:44.599
she's obviously, you're
her dude on the side.

31:44.632 --> 31:47.703
And she's like lookin' for
something and.

31:47.736 --> 31:48.737
- Let's keep the video on the
site

31:48.770 --> 31:50.171
and let's keep makin' hits,

31:50.205 --> 31:51.171
and I don't care.

31:51.205 --> 31:52.473
I, I'll date her.

31:52.507 --> 31:53.173
Let's put it this way,

31:53.207 --> 31:54.108
if she keeps givin' videos,

31:54.141 --> 31:55.976
they get 30,000,000 hits, I'll
date her,

31:56.010 --> 31:57.078
I'll date her for a year.
- You don't care

31:57.112 --> 31:58.046
what she looks like.
- Yeah, exactly, I don't care

31:58.079 --> 31:58.946
what she looks like.
- You don't care what

31:58.979 --> 31:59.780
she looks like, you're gonna
love her.

31:59.814 --> 32:02.182
- Exactly, exactly.
- She's gonna,

32:02.216 --> 32:03.951
you're gonna beer bitch.
- Payin' for my Aston Martin.

32:03.984 --> 32:05.920
I'll be, yeah, I'll be happy,
so, yeah.

32:05.953 --> 32:06.587
- Well either way, man.
- I'll take one for the team.

32:06.621 --> 32:07.522
- I'm really happy for you.

32:07.555 --> 32:09.557
I really--
- You're really happy for me.

32:09.590 --> 32:11.726
I can't wait to be
the godfather to your kids.

32:11.759 --> 32:12.727
- Shut up!

32:15.962 --> 32:20.000
- This morning, obviously
our most popular video

32:20.034 --> 32:21.569
right now is the,

32:23.069 --> 32:25.805
the graveyard video, it's really
well.

32:25.839 --> 32:27.006
Great, so like here's a bunch.

32:27.040 --> 32:27.974
"This girl is so hot."

32:28.007 --> 32:30.044
"Wow, this video scared
the crap outta me."

32:30.077 --> 32:32.646
Wow, so we've got Tyler
Daniel's information.

32:32.679 --> 32:36.816
Thanks, Tyler, you've just
become a Gigaler member.

32:48.293 --> 32:50.129
There's like

32:50.163 --> 32:52.566
hundreds of these comments.

32:56.068 --> 32:59.004
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Mark.

32:59.037 --> 32:59.906
Mark.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.041
Abbi, come look, please.

33:03.075 --> 33:04.743
Quickly, emergency.

33:06.979 --> 33:09.114
Have you seen Tara Rogers?

33:11.984 --> 33:13.819
- I just went through the
comment threads.

33:16.054 --> 33:18.023
So I was going through
the comment threads.

33:18.056 --> 33:19.223
Ella Grace.

33:19.256 --> 33:20.893
"This looks like that Tara
Rogers girl who went missing."

33:20.926 --> 33:22.628
"No way, I agree, this is nuts.

33:22.661 --> 33:23.328
"When was this made?

33:23.361 --> 33:24.396
"This is def her, google it."

33:24.429 --> 33:26.098
"Seriously, she went
missing a couple years ago.

33:26.131 --> 33:26.998
"I remember, that's freaky."

33:27.031 --> 33:29.634
"Oh wow, this is for real."

33:29.667 --> 33:32.905
When I google Tara Rogers, this
pops up.

33:34.139 --> 33:35.807
That is that girl.

33:35.840 --> 33:37.642
That's the same girl.

33:41.246 --> 33:42.747
Oh no.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.949
She has a Facebook
page.

33:44.982 --> 33:45.983
Um.

33:46.918 --> 33:48.686
- It looks just like her.

33:48.720 --> 33:49.420
- Do you think it looks like
her?

33:49.453 --> 33:50.587
- I know, I know.
- It does.

33:50.621 --> 33:51.656
It does, okay.

33:51.689 --> 33:54.258
It says she's
been missing for years.

33:54.291 --> 33:56.961
Help us find, our efforts
to find Tara Rogers, 21,

33:56.994 --> 33:58.929
of Rochester, new York?

33:58.962 --> 34:00.196
Shit.

34:00.230 --> 34:01.164
Tom.

34:01.197 --> 34:02.199
- Yes.
- Tom, Chris.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.334
- I think you need

34:03.367 --> 34:04.936
to check your inboxes.

34:04.969 --> 34:06.903
Right now, check 'em, please.

34:06.937 --> 34:09.172
Quickly.
- All right.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.377
- Take a close look.

34:14.409 --> 34:17.013
Tara Rogers missing.

34:19.983 --> 34:20.817
No way.

34:20.851 --> 34:23.186
- Look at all the links.

34:23.219 --> 34:24.320
Guys, there are dozens,

34:24.353 --> 34:25.889
I mean there are dozens of news
articles

34:25.922 --> 34:27.023
about the disappearance of this
girl.

34:27.056 --> 34:29.259
She's been gone for two years.

34:29.292 --> 34:30.359
Hold up.

34:30.391 --> 34:32.061
And so we're saying?
- Click, click, click, click.

34:32.094 --> 34:33.228
- Yeah.

34:33.263 --> 34:36.266
She's got a Facebook profile.

34:36.299 --> 34:37.167
Hold on.

34:38.900 --> 34:39.768
There's a video.
- Missing from the

34:39.802 --> 34:40.902
Rochester area.

34:40.936 --> 34:42.371
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

34:42.404 --> 34:43.371
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Shh, shh, shh,

34:43.405 --> 34:44.775
I got a video, I got a video.

34:44.808 --> 34:47.409
- Meet, and it's going really
well.

34:47.442 --> 34:48.944
I met him at a bar last week.

34:48.978 --> 34:51.146
Um, so.
- That sounds like her.

34:51.179 --> 34:54.014
It's like, I'd say he's
an eight.

34:54.047 --> 34:56.752
He looked much better--
- That's the voice.

34:56.786 --> 34:58.053
It is.

34:58.087 --> 34:59.088
What the hell?

34:59.121 --> 35:00.155
- So what do you--
- Hold up, hold up, hold up.

35:00.189 --> 35:02.724
Let me get the video.

35:02.757 --> 35:03.992
That this?
- But how do you,

35:04.025 --> 35:04.927
how do you know?

35:04.960 --> 35:06.028
Where, like where, how did this
all start?

35:06.061 --> 35:08.698
- Okay, I was scrolling
through the video comments.

35:08.731 --> 35:09.564
Okay.

35:09.598 --> 35:10.665
- And someone, there was like a,
a thread

35:10.699 --> 35:14.769
of like 500 deep saying
this looks like Tara Rogers.

35:14.803 --> 35:16.371
- I'm lookin' at the
original screamer video.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.707
Let's, I'm scrubbin' this--
- It's the same girl!

35:18.740 --> 35:22.076
Tom, there's a
1-800 hotline for this girl.

35:22.110 --> 35:23.211
No way.

35:23.244 --> 35:23.945
- There's multiple hotlines

35:23.978 --> 35:24.645
for this girl.
- Where is the,

35:24.679 --> 35:27.816
I had the window up with the,

35:27.849 --> 35:29.450
see this, I'm lookin'
at the video right now.

35:29.483 --> 35:32.186
That face, yeah, it looks,

35:32.220 --> 35:33.421
right there it looks detached.

35:33.454 --> 35:34.788
That's VFX.

35:34.822 --> 35:36.390
They're doin' some kind, this is
a prank.

35:36.424 --> 35:37.759
- Tom.
- Tom, you said it sounded

35:37.792 --> 35:38.793
just like her.
- Tom.

35:38.827 --> 35:39.861
- So they do the voice.

35:39.894 --> 35:41.295
You don't think they can
do the voice on the phone?

35:41.329 --> 35:42.262
Come on!
- You're the one who said

35:42.295 --> 35:43.196
it sounded just like her.

35:43.230 --> 35:44.364
You're the one that's been
talking to her

35:44.397 --> 35:45.899
for the past two days.

35:45.933 --> 35:47.268
- Then let's get her
on the phone right now

35:47.301 --> 35:48.502
and we'll ask her.

35:48.536 --> 35:49.937
- That'll solve the problem.

35:49.970 --> 35:51.304
- I'm gonna ask her who she is.

35:51.338 --> 35:53.040
She never said her last name
once.

35:53.073 --> 35:54.107
Well, yeah, but, but.

35:54.141 --> 35:54.975
So you think she's gonna say

35:55.008 --> 35:56.409
yes, I'm Tara Rogers?

35:56.443 --> 35:58.345
- Uh, let's find out.
- Think before you call her.

35:58.378 --> 35:59.980
You should have a plan.
- I don't have a plan

36:00.013 --> 36:01.414
'cause I'm pissed off!

36:01.448 --> 36:02.382
Shh, shh, shh.

36:06.318 --> 36:07.354
- Yeah, hey, Tara.

36:07.387 --> 36:09.122
Um, I had a question for ya.

36:09.156 --> 36:11.058
Actually, I realized I
never caught your last name.

36:11.091 --> 36:13.093
What was your last name?

36:17.329 --> 36:18.398
Is it Rogers?

36:21.533 --> 36:22.601
- Francis is there, okay.

36:22.634 --> 36:26.973
Now who is, is, is Francis,
who is Francis again?

36:28.275 --> 36:29.441
- All right, Tara, can I ask
you?

36:29.475 --> 36:31.811
Are you, are you pretending to
be?

36:31.844 --> 36:32.845
Are you some?

36:32.879 --> 36:34.113
Are you aware of the missing
girl

36:34.146 --> 36:36.348
named Tara Rogers?

36:36.382 --> 36:37.248
Tara?

36:38.384 --> 36:40.787
Are you aware of that girl?

36:50.496 --> 36:52.865
I'm telling you,
that's her.

36:52.899 --> 36:54.032
- I'm telling you it's her.

36:54.065 --> 36:54.933
- I don't know what now.

36:54.966 --> 36:56.301
- She has access to a phone.

36:56.334 --> 36:58.236
How can she be missing for two
years?

36:58.269 --> 36:59.939
- Exactly.

36:59.972 --> 37:00.940
Exactly, exactly.

37:00.973 --> 37:02.240
- You think she staged it.
- So this is some

37:02.273 --> 37:03.074
type of hoax.

37:03.108 --> 37:03.741
This is a backstory they put
together

37:03.775 --> 37:05.510
for the screamer video, man.

37:05.543 --> 37:06.611
If it really
is a missing person,

37:06.644 --> 37:08.814
I think the police are
going to be calling Gigaler

37:08.847 --> 37:10.048
any minute.

37:10.081 --> 37:11.316
I think we have maybe a day.
- Well we don't have to tell--

37:11.349 --> 37:12.217
- Great, great, that's press.

37:12.250 --> 37:13.318
We'll get triple the hits.

37:13.351 --> 37:14.185
Fantastic!

37:14.219 --> 37:15.153
- I don't know, guys.

37:15.186 --> 37:18.055
Other scenario, some missing
girl is being

37:18.088 --> 37:19.890
just totally exploited and
manipulated,

37:19.924 --> 37:20.758
and somewhere there's a family

37:20.792 --> 37:22.260
that might have to suffer over
this.

37:22.293 --> 37:24.229
So can we just?

37:24.262 --> 37:26.163
- We can spin this beautifully.

37:26.196 --> 37:28.165
Here's what we do.

37:28.198 --> 37:30.334
Everybody relax, we do more
research.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.436
Abbi, check out this video.

37:31.469 --> 37:33.437
See if you can find if
there's any visual effects,

37:33.470 --> 37:35.105
or they're doing, you know,
any whatever it's called.

37:35.139 --> 37:36.974
Vertiscoping, whatever
they're doing with the face.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.442
See what you can find, okay?

37:38.475 --> 37:39.877
Griffin, do more research.

37:39.910 --> 37:41.311
I want a pile of papers on my
desk.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.346
And you know what, Chris?

37:42.379 --> 37:43.547
Worst-case scenario, scenario,

37:43.580 --> 37:44.915
we reframe this, okay?

37:44.949 --> 37:46.416
We make it, uh, you know,

37:46.450 --> 37:47.551
can you believe this is
happening?

37:47.584 --> 37:49.418
They're posting images of a dead
girl.

37:49.452 --> 37:52.289
- Tom, Tom.
- Doing anything irrational,

37:52.322 --> 37:53.290
doing anything, you know,

37:53.323 --> 37:54.892
jumping into conclusions.
- Impulsive, yeah.

37:54.925 --> 37:55.860
Conclusions right now,
I,

37:55.893 --> 37:57.126
I don't want to assume anything.

37:57.160 --> 37:57.827
- Okay.
- Griffin.

37:57.861 --> 37:58.627
Griffin, I don't wanna assume

37:58.661 --> 37:59.595
anything, okay?
- I'm just saying

37:59.628 --> 38:01.264
I think it's irrational
to wait, that's all.

38:02.566 --> 38:04.401
You work for us, do what we ask.

38:04.434 --> 38:06.469
Get the research, you check out
the video.

38:06.502 --> 38:07.370
Goshdang.

38:11.274 --> 38:13.209
It could never be easy.

38:14.277 --> 38:15.344
Are you kidding me?

38:15.378 --> 38:17.046
Hey, Chris.

38:19.215 --> 38:20.116
- What are you looking at me
like,

38:20.149 --> 38:21.884
what are you lookin' at me like
that for?

38:21.917 --> 38:25.955
All right, Chris, what the
hell you want me to do?

38:25.989 --> 38:27.123
Can we, actually, can
we just stop filming,

38:27.156 --> 38:28.590
please, Mark, all right?

38:28.623 --> 38:29.657
Follow them.

38:29.691 --> 38:31.459
Jesus, get the hell outta
here for five minutes.

38:35.664 --> 38:37.065
I will stick to this,

38:37.099 --> 38:38.633
that we did not do anything
wrong.

38:38.666 --> 38:39.567
And we didn't.

38:39.601 --> 38:41.036
You see what I'm saying?

38:41.069 --> 38:42.404
It's like, what have we done,
Griff?

38:42.437 --> 38:44.539
We, we put, we got a
video and we posted it.

38:44.572 --> 38:46.641
We didn't do anything wrong, you
know?

38:46.674 --> 38:48.043
And--
- We didn't do anything

38:48.076 --> 38:49.544
wrong up till now.
- Right, that's--

38:49.577 --> 38:51.013
- From, from, from, from,
from here on forward,

38:51.046 --> 38:52.180
what we do--
- Everything is wrong.

38:52.214 --> 38:53.114
- What we do--
- We, we haven't done--

38:53.147 --> 38:53.916
- No, no, no.
- We haven't done anything

38:53.949 --> 38:55.017
wrong yet.
- It's not, it's not--

38:55.050 --> 38:57.385
- Everything is wrong.

38:57.419 --> 38:58.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
Mark.

38:58.153 --> 39:00.222
- I guess.
- Yeah, whatever.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.189
- Thanks.
- This could all be a hoax.

39:02.223 --> 39:03.057
- Okay.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.125
- That's been going on for two
years?

39:04.158 --> 39:06.394
- That's an elaborate hoax

39:06.428 --> 39:08.096
for one video.

39:08.130 --> 39:08.963
That's all I'm saying.

39:08.996 --> 39:11.298
It's an elaborate hoax for one
video.

39:11.332 --> 39:12.666
You think this girl
stopped her Facebook page

39:12.699 --> 39:14.937
two years ago?

39:14.970 --> 39:18.005
When was the last post,
let's find that out.

39:18.039 --> 39:19.406
Two whole years.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.975
That's quite an elaborate hoax,

39:21.008 --> 39:22.676
that's all I'm sayin'.

39:22.709 --> 39:23.510
- Hi, guys.

39:23.544 --> 39:25.479
Um, so, you know how much I
like--

39:25.512 --> 39:26.513
- Is this the girl you were
talking to?

39:26.547 --> 39:28.549
- That's the voice.
- How much money I spend--

39:28.582 --> 39:30.017
That is the girl.

39:30.051 --> 39:30.918
- You know what, you shouldn't
show,

39:30.952 --> 39:31.785
actually, don't show this.

39:31.818 --> 39:34.955
I don't want you showing this,
no, no.

39:35.722 --> 39:37.424
Well, we reframe maybe, you
know?

39:37.458 --> 39:39.026
Or we put out a press release

39:39.060 --> 39:40.326
saying exactly what happened.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.427
I'm not saying to lie.
- Yeah, okay.

39:41.461 --> 39:42.528
- I'm saying exactly what
happened.

39:42.562 --> 39:43.396
- Okay, I'm okay with that.
- We were submitted this

39:43.429 --> 39:44.965
and we put it up and we didn't
know,

39:44.998 --> 39:45.665
you know what I mean?

39:45.698 --> 39:46.500
And then it makes us some good

39:46.533 --> 39:48.468
and still gets us hits.

39:48.501 --> 39:49.369
It's Abbs.

39:49.402 --> 39:50.603
Hi.

39:50.636 --> 39:51.504
All right.
- Hey, Abbi.

39:51.537 --> 39:52.638
Hey, hey, hey.

39:52.672 --> 39:54.540
- Honestly, guys, mystery
solved.

39:55.341 --> 39:57.310
- We have--
- Mark, watch out.

39:57.343 --> 39:59.012
- We have some, uh,

40:00.680 --> 40:02.215
some assholes.

40:02.248 --> 40:04.283
I was scrubbing though the
video,

40:04.316 --> 40:06.185
and I realized

40:06.218 --> 40:07.087
that this

40:08.388 --> 40:09.922
grave that we see

40:10.656 --> 40:12.524
right in front in this
first screamer that we got

40:12.557 --> 40:15.094
belongs to a Francis Tumuelety.

40:15.127 --> 40:16.228
- Oh, jeez, that's--

40:16.261 --> 40:17.263
- Francis.

40:17.297 --> 40:18.264
When you look that up,

40:18.298 --> 40:21.233
along with Rochester,
et cetera, et cetera,

40:21.266 --> 40:23.468
with all the information
that we got from this girl.

40:23.502 --> 40:24.269
- You land on a

40:24.303 --> 40:27.539
Francis Tumblety.

40:27.572 --> 40:30.075
- Who is one of the prime
suspects

40:30.109 --> 40:32.311
of Jack the Ripper murders.

40:33.312 --> 40:34.179
So.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.147
- No way.

40:36.981 --> 40:38.383
- You know, it must be real,
Griffin.

40:38.417 --> 40:39.484
This must be a real girl

40:39.518 --> 40:41.386
that's kidnapped by Jack the
Ripper.

40:41.420 --> 40:43.555
Yeah, that makes sense.
- We know from finding

40:43.588 --> 40:45.289
out information about her
from her social media--

40:45.323 --> 40:47.258
- Jesus.
- What a bunch of assholes.

40:47.291 --> 40:49.528
She was supposed
to be a little promiscuous.

40:49.561 --> 40:51.196
All of Jack the Ripper's victims

40:51.230 --> 40:52.496
are a little promiscuous.

40:52.530 --> 40:54.432
It just seems so,

40:54.465 --> 40:56.367
so set up and so messed up.
- Yeah!

40:56.400 --> 40:59.071
- I still don't understand.
- I would like to be clear.

40:59.104 --> 41:00.738
We're not dealing with
kidnappers anymore.

41:00.771 --> 41:02.306
We're dealing with assholes,
okay?

41:02.340 --> 41:03.407
We're dealing with assholes

41:03.441 --> 41:04.775
that are messing with us, okay?

41:04.808 --> 41:08.111
And they need a little lesson,
okay?

41:08.145 --> 41:09.112
How 'bout this?

41:09.146 --> 41:11.282
Griffin, come on, I need
you back here, buddy.

41:11.315 --> 41:12.650
Listen.

41:12.683 --> 41:14.152
How 'bout this?

41:14.185 --> 41:16.586
We go up there, we take this
camera, okay?

41:16.619 --> 41:18.421
We take this camera, we go up
there,

41:18.455 --> 41:19.656
and we confront them.

41:19.689 --> 41:21.125
What are ya doin'?

41:21.159 --> 41:21.992
We have an address.

41:22.026 --> 41:23.726
Let's go knock on the goddamn
door.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.328
- We're not gonna go,

41:25.362 --> 41:26.529
we're not gonna go on a tour

41:26.563 --> 41:29.032
and, and, and break a story.

41:30.100 --> 41:31.169
- Chris, we get that video,

41:31.202 --> 41:31.868
we capture that video,

41:31.901 --> 41:33.136
it's a simple knock on the door.

41:33.170 --> 41:34.371
What did you do?

41:34.404 --> 41:36.173
I mean, it's like investigative
reporting.

41:36.206 --> 41:37.774
And guess what?

41:37.807 --> 41:38.875
It plays everywhere.

41:38.908 --> 41:40.777
You know how many media
stations would pick that up?

41:40.810 --> 41:42.045
Griff?

41:42.079 --> 41:43.713
- I think it's fucking genius.

41:43.746 --> 41:47.184
I say we leave tomorrow.
- Look at this, yes!

41:47.217 --> 41:48.650
Yes, yes!
- It's a really fun idea,

41:48.684 --> 41:50.086
but we're not gonna like show up

41:50.119 --> 41:52.089
like cavaliers to be?

41:53.490 --> 41:54.324
- Think how huge it could be.
- Could I have,

41:54.357 --> 41:55.024
could I have a minute?

41:55.058 --> 41:55.957
Let's step away for a minute.

41:55.991 --> 41:58.660
Just one minute over here,
please, please.

41:58.694 --> 41:59.595
Come here.
- You gonna put me

41:59.628 --> 42:01.097
in a corner?
- Yes, you're in the corner.

42:01.130 --> 42:01.831
You're in time-out.
- A time-out.

42:01.864 --> 42:02.799
A time-out.
- Come here.

42:02.832 --> 42:04.133
- Time -out.

42:04.166 --> 42:06.034
Can you not?

42:10.739 --> 42:11.772
This goes everywhere.

42:11.806 --> 42:13.242
Bam, Gigaler though the roof.

42:13.275 --> 42:15.211
Okay, we're barely keepin'
the lights on, man.

42:15.244 --> 42:17.846
This gets exposed and we
have to take the video down,

42:17.879 --> 42:18.847
goodbye.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.648
Unless we get another
pot of gold in our laps.

42:20.681 --> 42:22.250
This is a pot of gold in our
laps!

42:22.283 --> 42:23.619
- Tom, you don't have to yell at
me, okay?

42:24.486 --> 42:25.154
Was I yelling?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,

42:25.187 --> 42:26.122
you're, you're kind of yelling,

42:26.155 --> 42:28.156
and I don't want you to raise
your voice,

42:28.189 --> 42:28.856
okay?
- Okay.

42:28.889 --> 42:31.359
- So you were telling me that we

42:31.392 --> 42:33.662
are going to benefit?
- Yes!

42:33.695 --> 42:35.696
Everything, everything will
benefit.

42:35.730 --> 42:39.167
This is gonna be on media
outlets,

42:39.200 --> 42:42.370
TV news outlets, everywhere,
come on!

42:43.704 --> 42:45.306
- No, this is not our job.

42:45.340 --> 42:46.507
But this is the core team,

42:46.541 --> 42:48.609
and if this, this hits?

42:48.643 --> 42:50.778
The core team, this is
successful, man.

42:50.811 --> 42:54.115
I mean, like, what's
the worst

42:54.149 --> 42:55.683
The worst-case scenario, we get
nothing.

42:55.716 --> 42:57.252
They tell us to get the hell
outta there.

42:57.285 --> 42:58.619
And then we walk back with crap.

42:58.653 --> 43:01.821
Sure, what have we lost, one
day?

43:01.855 --> 43:03.190
But what have we gained?

43:03.223 --> 43:05.260
On the other side, what have we
gained

43:05.293 --> 43:07.594
if this goes gigantic?

43:07.627 --> 43:09.596
- And we expose someone
for setting all this up,

43:09.629 --> 43:10.430
and--
- Yeah!

43:12.199 --> 43:12.932
You really think this
is going

43:12.966 --> 43:14.834
to help our website?
- Oh yeah.

43:14.868 --> 43:17.137
- I don't, okay, I don't,

43:18.405 --> 43:19.673
okay, I don't see that,

43:19.706 --> 43:21.641
but I, I, I, I don't see that,

43:21.675 --> 43:24.610
but I am going to, to, to, to
trust

43:27.714 --> 43:30.517
that whatever you, whatever you.

43:30.550 --> 43:31.917
- That's all I need, just a
little trust.

43:31.950 --> 43:33.051
That's all I need.

43:33.085 --> 43:34.653
- That whatever you think
that this is goin' to be,

43:34.687 --> 43:36.290
than I--
- Yes, I do.

43:36.323 --> 43:37.657
We're gonna do this, we're gonna
do this.

43:37.691 --> 43:38.625
- Yep.

43:38.657 --> 43:39.592
Yep.

43:39.625 --> 43:40.459
What have we got?

43:40.493 --> 43:41.627
Limo!

43:41.660 --> 43:42.561
We're goin' on a jet plane?
- No, no, make that clear!

43:42.595 --> 43:43.396
Actually, Mark, we don't even
need you.

43:43.429 --> 43:45.731
The four of us, core team's
goin' up

43:45.765 --> 43:47.200
with the camera.
- Mark.

43:47.233 --> 43:49.602
- We're takin' a drive,
we're goin' up there.

43:49.635 --> 43:50.836
Tell me the address again.
- Mark.

43:50.869 --> 43:51.937
Do we need to
look for hotels up here?

43:51.970 --> 43:54.739
- Guys, I, I've, I've still
got a cousin up there.

43:54.772 --> 43:56.742
I don't know, we could call her,

43:56.775 --> 43:58.911
and see if she's got--
- Do it, do it.

43:58.944 --> 44:00.379
Savin' money, savin' money.
- We could do a hotel.

44:00.413 --> 44:01.380
We could do a hotel.

44:01.414 --> 44:03.415
- No, no, no, no,
tomorrow night, that's it.

44:03.448 --> 44:04.482
Cool?

44:04.516 --> 44:05.583
- Okay, tomorrow night,

44:05.617 --> 44:07.586
we'll be there tomorrow night.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.854
- Oh, this is great.

44:08.887 --> 44:10.323
- We're not investigating
anything.

44:10.356 --> 44:11.889
We're bringing a camera
to someone's house.

44:11.923 --> 44:14.759
- Mm hmm, to say why have you
been lying?

44:14.792 --> 44:15.893
- Sorry.

44:17.263 --> 44:18.096
He's drinking water.

44:18.130 --> 44:19.197
He just spilled it all over the
floor.

44:19.231 --> 44:21.165
- It's fine, it's fine.

44:21.899 --> 44:25.703
- I'm not upset, I just.

44:26.703 --> 44:29.274
Okay, we will
see you tomorrow night.

44:29.307 --> 44:30.808
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Oh my God!

44:30.842 --> 44:32.244
This is happening,
this is happening.

44:32.277 --> 44:32.944
- It's getting even better.
- Yep.

44:32.977 --> 44:34.678
All right, we'll jump in my car

44:34.711 --> 44:35.479
tomorrow morning.
- Family reunion.

44:36.213 --> 44:37.180
- We stop at the grave first.

44:37.214 --> 44:39.751
This guy, this is the
Rochester area, right?

44:39.784 --> 44:40.418
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:40.452 --> 44:41.419
We stop at the grave first.

44:41.453 --> 44:43.354
And we go up there and
we do the whole thing.

44:43.387 --> 44:45.789
This is where they set
this thing up and whatever.

44:45.822 --> 44:46.490
This ain't clicks anymore,

44:46.523 --> 44:47.991
this ain't the Internet anymore.

44:48.024 --> 44:50.461
We're gonna be on TV, media,
radio.

44:50.494 --> 44:51.428
- I've wanted to be a part

44:51.462 --> 44:53.364
of something revolutionary my
entire life,

44:53.397 --> 44:54.931
and, uh, uh, uh,

44:54.965 --> 44:57.634
and I feel like Gigaler is it.

44:57.668 --> 44:58.769
From the beginning of the
Internet,

44:58.802 --> 45:00.737
people have been trying to
monetize,

45:00.771 --> 45:02.906
uh, uh, your, your time,

45:02.939 --> 45:06.009
and I hope and I pray
that as we move forward,

45:06.042 --> 45:08.978
this becomes the model
in which all future,

45:09.011 --> 45:11.848
uh, uh, uh, start-up
endeavors are built on.

45:11.882 --> 45:14.717
Not on, on, on monetizing
people's time,

45:14.750 --> 45:16.452
but on providing them with
something

45:16.486 --> 45:18.854
that is truly a beneficial
relationship.

45:18.888 --> 45:21.725
Uh, and I hope that if
you come to work for us,

45:21.758 --> 45:23.426
uh, you can get on board
because, uh,

45:23.459 --> 45:24.527
uh, frankly, if you're not,

45:24.560 --> 45:26.996
then, uh, uh, you don't belong
here.

45:27.029 --> 45:27.897
Um.

45:29.799 --> 45:32.268
Uh, sorry, that just kinda came,
came out.

45:32.302 --> 45:34.437
But was that, is that sort of?
- I think it's great.

45:34.470 --> 45:35.305
Okay.

45:39.741 --> 45:41.744
- All right, here we go.

45:43.546 --> 45:45.281
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

45:45.315 --> 45:47.282
This is morning and, uh,

45:47.316 --> 45:47.982
we are

45:48.817 --> 45:51.654
en route to pick up Griffin and
Abbi

45:51.687 --> 45:54.956
for Tom's, uh, adventure
extraordinaire,

45:56.425 --> 45:57.492
investigative

45:58.627 --> 46:00.028
uh, co-op mission.

46:01.531 --> 46:03.965
- You have to kinda follow
the signs and the omens

46:03.998 --> 46:04.966
and just, uh--
- We're going to follow

46:04.999 --> 46:08.002
the omens, that's
exactly what we're doing.

46:08.036 --> 46:08.937
- When something falls in your
lap,

46:08.970 --> 46:10.838
you may not know what the end
result is,

46:10.871 --> 46:13.074
and I think that's, gosh,
that's,

46:13.107 --> 46:14.609
I hate to make it into
a motivational speech,

46:14.643 --> 46:15.910
but isn't that Gigaler?

46:15.944 --> 46:17.346
- Oh my gosh.
- I mean, we just follow

46:17.379 --> 46:18.446
our, our hearts.
- Don't make it a,

46:18.479 --> 46:20.781
it's too early for a
motivational speech right now.

46:20.814 --> 46:21.649
- I'm gonna make ya all hold
hands

46:21.682 --> 46:23.585
when they get in the car.

46:23.618 --> 46:24.486
You're kidding.

46:24.519 --> 46:25.186
How long's the drive?

46:25.219 --> 46:26.520
- Uh, I think it's four hours.

46:26.554 --> 46:27.655
- Yeah.
- Yep.

46:27.688 --> 46:29.022
- They're waiting outside

46:29.056 --> 46:30.358
or no?
- Uh, he said they're

46:30.391 --> 46:31.425
waiting for us.
- Okay.

46:31.459 --> 46:32.326
- So.
- I guess we'll figure

46:32.360 --> 46:33.294
that out when we pull up.

46:33.328 --> 46:35.363
- In case you got--
- They are not outside,

46:35.396 --> 46:36.430
for the record.
- All right, yeah.

46:36.464 --> 46:37.365
- I can see them.
- Here we go,

46:37.398 --> 46:38.098
we're pulling up.

46:38.131 --> 46:40.468
I don't see them anywhere.

46:41.934 --> 46:45.339
They should be coming out.
- Hey!

46:45.373 --> 46:46.907
- Right outta there.
- I'm still beepin'.

46:46.940 --> 46:48.876
Ready?
- Beep beep beep.

46:50.076 --> 46:51.110
There they are.

46:53.947 --> 46:55.115
They have got the camera.
- Look at him,

46:55.148 --> 46:56.417
he's got the camera already.

46:56.450 --> 46:59.886
Look at him, look at him, he's
ready.

46:59.919 --> 47:01.087
Good morning!
- Morning, guys.

47:01.120 --> 47:02.489
- Good morning to you.
- Yes!

47:02.522 --> 47:03.322
- Morning.
- The Giglar

47:03.356 --> 47:06.626
Investigation Team, ready to
roll.

47:07.960 --> 47:10.397
The Giglar Investigation Team?

47:10.430 --> 47:11.130
- The GIT.

47:11.163 --> 47:12.098
Yeah.

47:12.999 --> 47:15.535
Can we get some coffee?
- Can we please

47:15.568 --> 47:17.370
get something to eat?

47:18.438 --> 47:19.338
- I wouldn't mind like a
little--

47:19.372 --> 47:22.674
There's no coffee in
the limo.

47:22.708 --> 47:24.142
Abbi's already down.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.012
The hood is on.

47:26.045 --> 47:29.148
She hates life right now.
- No, we're gonna--

47:29.181 --> 47:29.848
Abbi, have
you ever been in a car

47:29.881 --> 47:32.884
with three men for four hours?

47:32.918 --> 47:33.985
- No.

47:34.019 --> 47:35.187
What am I getting myself into
here?

47:35.221 --> 47:36.856
Ready for all
the smells that come with it?

47:36.889 --> 47:38.457
- No!
- Jesus.

47:38.490 --> 47:39.758
- Would you rather, would you
rather

47:39.791 --> 47:41.627
achieve great things

47:41.660 --> 47:43.662
and, uh, you know, be
respectable

47:43.695 --> 47:44.763
and have no one remember you,

47:44.796 --> 47:47.833
or, like, do something
that puts you off the edge,

47:47.866 --> 47:49.535
but you're infamous.

47:49.568 --> 47:50.402
All right, so gimme this.

47:50.436 --> 47:51.537
All right, so, okay.

47:51.570 --> 47:52.571
Tumblety,

47:52.604 --> 47:54.772
Tumblety, right, like,

47:54.805 --> 47:57.509
is infamous now because
he was Jack the Ripper.

47:57.543 --> 47:59.411
So, like, would you rather be
infamous

47:59.445 --> 48:00.846
or, uh, forgotten?

48:01.946 --> 48:04.014
- Could I be famous for
something like amazing?

48:04.048 --> 48:06.050
Or do I have to be
famous for something bad?

48:06.083 --> 48:07.553
- But infamous means that you're
famous

48:07.586 --> 48:08.787
for some bad reason.

48:08.820 --> 48:09.887
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.490
- Yeah, yeah, always.

48:12.523 --> 48:14.559
- Would you rather be--

48:16.895 --> 48:17.828
Infamy or--

48:18.829 --> 48:20.164
- Or nothin'.
- Or nothin'.

48:20.197 --> 48:21.599
- Um,

48:21.632 --> 48:23.468
as long as, I, I don't know.

48:23.501 --> 48:26.836
Did I accomplish everything I
wanted to accomplish in life?

48:26.870 --> 48:29.874
But if I was good and I
accomplished things, um,

48:29.907 --> 48:30.808
content.
- If you accomplished

48:30.841 --> 48:33.042
everything but just weren't
remembered.

48:33.076 --> 48:34.210
- That's fine with me.
- That would be good enough

48:34.243 --> 48:35.078
for you.
- Abbi.

48:35.111 --> 48:37.046
- Oh my God.
- Griffin.

48:38.816 --> 48:41.485
- I'm watching a video

48:41.518 --> 48:42.452
someone submitted

48:42.486 --> 48:46.623
of this person, um,
sleeping, getting wasabi

48:46.656 --> 48:47.857
all in her mouth.

48:54.130 --> 48:57.600
Why would you do that to
somebody?

49:15.518 --> 49:16.218
- Thank you.

49:25.227 --> 49:26.061
There it is.

49:29.731 --> 49:33.268
You guys wanna see some
exits?

49:33.301 --> 49:35.170
- I'll see it.
- I'll look up the exact,

49:35.203 --> 49:36.971
you guys have the exit, right?

49:37.004 --> 49:38.072
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I mean, you have the address

49:38.105 --> 49:39.607
so you could guess, but, yeah,

49:39.641 --> 49:41.977
we're gonna go to--

49:43.879 --> 49:46.914
It's, I, I don't know if
it's Sisters, but, um.

49:46.948 --> 49:48.850
- Well he's supposed, sure.

49:48.883 --> 49:51.887
So, Tumblety, there's a couple
reasons

49:51.920 --> 49:53.721
why he is the most likely Ripper
suspect.

49:53.755 --> 49:56.057
One, when he left, uh, London,

49:56.090 --> 49:57.825
the murders stopped.

49:57.859 --> 50:00.994
Uh, number two, uh, he
was a very rich guy,

50:01.027 --> 50:02.229
and when he was buried,

50:02.263 --> 50:03.598
they found, you know, diamonds

50:03.631 --> 50:05.032
and all this, this
rich, expensive jewelry,

50:05.066 --> 50:07.068
and they found two gold rings.

50:07.101 --> 50:08.635
And the first victim lost

50:08.669 --> 50:09.870
two gold rings.
- Two gold rings.

50:09.903 --> 50:10.971
- And then the third thing was,

50:11.004 --> 50:12.874
they had a handwriting expert
look at

50:12.907 --> 50:13.808
the Jack the Ripper letters,

50:13.841 --> 50:14.976
look at some of his letters,

50:15.009 --> 50:16.643
and said that's him.

50:16.677 --> 50:18.078
I mean, come on, you know what I
mean?

50:18.111 --> 50:19.946
Like that's, uh--
- Jeez.

50:19.980 --> 50:21.147
- Yeah.
- How soon can we get

50:21.181 --> 50:23.117
to this graveyard 'cause the
sun's gonna be setting soon,

50:23.150 --> 50:24.885
and I don't wanna be here for
that.

50:24.918 --> 50:26.152
Okay, can you wait a
mile?

50:26.186 --> 50:27.588
Let's get to this
graveyard

50:27.621 --> 50:29.155
as soon as possible.

50:30.090 --> 50:33.226
We've entered the danger
zone.

50:33.259 --> 50:34.795
Mm hmm.

50:36.062 --> 50:37.731
Okay, this is Section 10.

50:37.764 --> 50:39.265
Okay, so that's good,
right?

50:39.299 --> 50:41.166
Right, where are we
here?

50:41.200 --> 50:43.036
Uh, 11.
- 11, okay.

50:43.069 --> 50:45.038
So let's just keep goin' forward
here.

50:45.071 --> 50:47.273
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:47.307 --> 50:48.608
- This is it.

50:48.641 --> 50:49.408
This is it, this is it.
- That's it.

50:49.441 --> 50:50.275
- That's it right there.

50:50.309 --> 50:51.110
Here, this one right
here.

50:51.143 --> 50:54.014
Right there, let's do
it.

50:57.016 --> 51:00.753
Okay, let's
go look at a headstone.

51:06.358 --> 51:10.162
At least it's
not cold or anything.

51:11.764 --> 51:12.764
Woo!

51:13.898 --> 51:15.034
Let's do this.

51:24.977 --> 51:26.846
- Here it is, take it.

51:28.680 --> 51:30.815
Okay, here we are.

51:32.216 --> 51:36.354
Okay, yeah, that's
the one from the video.

51:39.423 --> 51:41.059
Tumuelty.

51:41.092 --> 51:41.760
- Yeah, that's right.

51:41.793 --> 51:42.927
It's spelled differently, huh?

51:42.961 --> 51:43.861
Yeah, what is it?

51:43.894 --> 51:44.762
T, yeah.

51:45.830 --> 51:46.665
- This is it right here.

51:46.698 --> 51:48.332
Dr. Francis Tumuelty.

51:48.366 --> 51:49.200
Yeah, look at this.

51:49.233 --> 51:50.368
This must be a brother or
something.

51:50.401 --> 51:51.335
1898, 1903.

51:54.371 --> 51:55.305
Hey, Tom, wanna take a
picture?

51:55.338 --> 51:56.307
- Jack the Ripper, yeah.
- Yeah.

51:56.340 --> 52:01.011
This is, oh
my God, just no respect.

52:01.044 --> 52:01.845
There's a dead person--

52:01.879 --> 52:05.649
He killed six prostitutes, come
on.

52:05.683 --> 52:07.218
There's my respect.

52:07.251 --> 52:10.888
He's lucky I don't pee on the
grave.

52:10.921 --> 52:11.755
Wait, watch out, watch out,

52:11.789 --> 52:12.990
there's a hand comin' for your
foot!

52:13.023 --> 52:14.024
I'm going home.

52:14.057 --> 52:15.225
- Hey, check this out.

52:15.258 --> 52:18.061
It says if you stand in front
of his grave at midnight,

52:18.095 --> 52:19.362
and you ask three times,

52:19.396 --> 52:21.999
are you Jack the Ripper,

52:22.032 --> 52:22.866
nothing happens

52:22.900 --> 52:23.700
'cause it's a dead guy.

52:23.733 --> 52:25.868
He's been dead for over 100
years.

52:25.902 --> 52:27.070
And that's the end of it.
Ba da bum da bum

52:27.104 --> 52:30.741
Bump
Ba du bump.

52:30.774 --> 52:31.908
Wow, man.

52:31.941 --> 52:34.143
This is history right here.

52:37.079 --> 52:39.149
You good to go?

52:47.023 --> 52:48.190
Come on, Griff.

53:17.786 --> 53:21.890
It's just so far apart
out here.

53:21.923 --> 53:23.324
You have any food?

53:25.894 --> 53:28.395
Oh shoot, Tom,
I don't think we're,

53:28.428 --> 53:29.965
I don't think we're goin' the
right way.

53:29.998 --> 53:31.066
- We're--
- Oh, we're definitely goin'

53:31.099 --> 53:32.267
the right way.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.434
- Oh.
- Well, no, I mean,

53:33.468 --> 53:35.402
I think Abbi knows.
- Okay.

53:35.435 --> 53:38.806
I don't know, I just was gonna.

53:38.839 --> 53:40.341
Just makin' sure you
had the right address.

53:40.375 --> 53:42.177
We would, uh, she'd be
correct,

53:42.210 --> 53:44.912
but we are not going to Emma's.

53:44.945 --> 53:47.114
Where are we going?

53:47.147 --> 53:48.415
We're going to Tara's
house.

53:48.448 --> 53:49.483
- Tom.
- Tom!

53:49.516 --> 53:51.018
You're kidding me.

53:51.051 --> 53:53.320
- Tom, we're not gonna go--

53:53.353 --> 53:54.288
Oh my God.
- Tom.

53:54.321 --> 53:55.790
- Okay.
- Tom, Tom, we--

53:55.823 --> 53:56.891
- You're kidding.
- When we said we were gonna

53:56.924 --> 53:59.225
do this, we, we, we, we
agreed we were gonna do it,

53:59.258 --> 54:00.126
you know--

54:01.428 --> 54:02.897
- Calm down.
- In a somewhat respectable

54:02.930 --> 54:04.364
way, we're not gonna show up at
her house.

54:04.398 --> 54:05.800
- Okay, first off, it's not that
late.

54:05.833 --> 54:06.633
Number one,

54:06.666 --> 54:07.600
number two--
- Pitch black outside.

54:07.633 --> 54:09.435
- Okay, yeah, and we
show up during the day,

54:09.468 --> 54:11.371
and we roll out with a bunch of
camera,

54:11.405 --> 54:13.040
you don't think they're gonna
freak out?

54:13.073 --> 54:13.740
What are we doing now?

54:13.774 --> 54:15.074
From the dark, we're jumping out

54:15.108 --> 54:16.242
with a bunch of cameras.

54:16.275 --> 54:17.877
They don't know what we
got goin'.

54:17.911 --> 54:18.544
We're just showin' up.

54:18.577 --> 54:19.612
We'll probably catch 'em.

54:19.645 --> 54:21.347
They're relaxing right now.
- Tom, I don' think

54:21.380 --> 54:22.449
this is a good idea.
- Tom.

54:22.482 --> 54:24.217
- Just pull around.

54:24.250 --> 54:25.318
Let's go to Emma's.
- Just pull around

54:25.351 --> 54:25.985
and go back to the road,

54:26.019 --> 54:28.154
and we can go to, to Abbi's.

54:28.187 --> 54:29.388
- All right, time out, time out.

54:29.422 --> 54:30.323
- Tom, don't--
- Lemme try to call her

54:30.356 --> 54:32.090
real quick, okay?

54:32.124 --> 54:32.959
- Jesus.
- You're gonna call Tara

54:32.992 --> 54:34.293
from inside of this car?

54:34.327 --> 54:35.361
Hey, Tara, we're in your
driveway.

54:35.394 --> 54:37.030
We're just right
outside of your house.

54:37.063 --> 54:38.931
- Actually, I'm not calling
anybody.

54:38.964 --> 54:40.866
- No signal.

54:40.899 --> 54:42.367
- Okay, well all the more
reason we drive somewhere

54:42.400 --> 54:43.937
where there's signal
and we give her a call,

54:43.970 --> 54:45.338
and we, we see--
- I gotta tell ya, Chris,

54:45.371 --> 54:46.572
we just pulled into this
driveway

54:46.605 --> 54:47.639
with lights flashin'.

54:47.672 --> 54:50.208
I mean, God, obviously
they know somebody's here.

54:50.242 --> 54:52.077
- Okay, they don't know who is
here, Tom.

54:52.110 --> 54:53.579
We pull out and we're just as
good

54:53.612 --> 54:56.548
as if we never came
here in the first place.

54:56.581 --> 54:58.050
No, man, this is good
video.

54:58.083 --> 54:58.951
This is good video.
- Tom, Tom, it's,

54:58.984 --> 54:59.985
okay, Tom, you're not,

55:00.018 --> 55:00.986
you're not listening to me.

55:01.019 --> 55:02.586
I don't think that this
is a good idea, okay?

55:02.619 --> 55:04.022
So I think that we go.

55:04.056 --> 55:05.423
- Let's try it.
- Tom, come on.

55:05.457 --> 55:08.126
- Tom, could you at least

55:08.160 --> 55:11.262
pretend to care what I think?

55:12.930 --> 55:14.799
Un-fucking-believable.

55:16.902 --> 55:18.270
Okay, guys, ready?

55:18.303 --> 55:20.537
Let's do what Tom wants to do.

55:20.571 --> 55:22.874
Let's get this over with.
- No, I'm good, thanks.

55:22.907 --> 55:24.075
You're not gonna come?

55:24.108 --> 55:25.978
- No!
- All right, well you can stay

55:26.011 --> 55:26.944
in the car.

55:29.513 --> 55:32.183
Are you not coming?

55:33.250 --> 55:33.885
- Fuck.

55:33.918 --> 55:36.387
I gotta go film.

55:38.622 --> 55:40.491
- You submitted a video to
Gigaler.com

55:40.524 --> 55:42.859
and we'd like to talk to you
about that.

55:42.893 --> 55:43.994
Okay?

55:44.027 --> 55:44.995
All right.

55:45.028 --> 55:46.163
Let's do this.

56:01.644 --> 56:02.512
Okay.

56:27.938 --> 56:30.239
I don't hear anything.

56:30.272 --> 56:33.408
There's a light on
upstairs.

56:34.276 --> 56:35.144
He's home.

56:39.281 --> 56:41.216
Okay, they don't wanna
answer the door, so--

56:41.250 --> 56:42.351
What, they're sleeping
at 8:30?

56:42.384 --> 56:43.285
- Well, I don't know,

56:43.318 --> 56:45.220
but they're not answering the
door, Tom.

56:45.254 --> 56:46.554
There's not, is there a
doorbell?

56:46.587 --> 56:47.455
- No.

56:49.458 --> 56:51.426
Can we try a side door?

56:51.460 --> 56:53.095
Oh my God.

56:53.128 --> 56:55.096
What about the side
door is more compelling

56:55.129 --> 56:56.497
for them to answer than the
front door?

56:56.530 --> 56:57.298
You know what?

56:57.331 --> 56:59.134
There's a flashlight in my
trunk.

56:59.168 --> 57:02.270
Grab that, I'll go knock
on the side door, okay?

57:02.303 --> 57:03.637
You want me
to grab a flashlight?

57:03.671 --> 57:05.006
Yeah, Chris, I can't
even see.

57:05.039 --> 57:07.942
It's in the trunk.

57:07.976 --> 57:09.078
- Sure thing, Tom.
- Time out, time out,

57:09.111 --> 57:10.144
time out.
- Anything you say, Tom.

57:10.178 --> 57:11.445
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

57:11.479 --> 57:13.581
Lighten up, Chris.

57:13.614 --> 57:15.483
Was that light on when we pulled
up?

57:15.516 --> 57:16.350
Yes.

57:16.384 --> 57:17.051
- Yeah.

57:17.085 --> 57:18.085
- It was on.

57:18.118 --> 57:19.053
So they're here.

57:19.087 --> 57:20.154
So they turned their
lights off.

57:20.188 --> 57:21.089
- Shine the light over here.
- So they're giving us

57:21.122 --> 57:22.991
the signal to go.
- Yeah, shine the light

57:23.024 --> 57:23.924
over here.
- Go away.

57:23.958 --> 57:25.459
- No, no, if they turned the
lights out,

57:25.493 --> 57:26.526
they're playing a game.

57:26.559 --> 57:27.394
I'm gonna knock on the door.
- When someone turns

57:27.427 --> 57:30.999
their lights off, they, that's
go away.

57:33.567 --> 57:36.103
- Tom, it's too much.
- Hello.

57:50.417 --> 57:51.518
That light was on, damn it.

58:02.295 --> 58:03.997
Can we check over here first?

58:04.897 --> 58:06.098
Just check this out, just to,
just.

58:14.506 --> 58:15.641
Oh.

58:15.674 --> 58:16.675
Oh my God.

58:19.578 --> 58:23.115
I just wanna
look in here real quick.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.630
Just checkin' it out, chill out.

58:39.664 --> 58:41.032
Here, shine the flashlight in.

58:44.336 --> 58:45.370
You see anything?

58:50.841 --> 58:54.579
Okay, cool garage,
let's go.

58:54.612 --> 58:55.513
- You know, I was hopin' to see

58:55.546 --> 58:59.050
like a whole production studio
in there.

58:59.084 --> 58:59.750
Damn it.

58:59.784 --> 59:01.218
Yeah, nothin' to see.

59:01.251 --> 59:03.721
Yeah, tell me about it.

59:09.226 --> 59:10.194
All right, I'm freezin' my balls
off.

59:10.227 --> 59:14.432
Let's get outta here.
- Let's get outta here.

59:14.465 --> 59:15.300
Come on, guys.

59:16.434 --> 59:18.368
What the hell was that?

59:19.269 --> 59:20.270
Did you guys see it?

59:20.304 --> 59:21.271
What?

59:21.305 --> 59:22.672
What?

59:22.706 --> 59:23.640
Chris, stop!

59:23.673 --> 59:26.710
Nothing, I
thought I saw something.

59:26.743 --> 59:28.745
What's going on?

59:30.247 --> 59:32.082
Chris, come on.

59:32.116 --> 59:34.283
- Let's see 'em try to
hide from us tomorrow.

59:34.317 --> 59:35.452
Tom.

59:36.820 --> 59:38.788
Damn it, damn it!

59:47.631 --> 59:50.733
Yeah, when we come back,
we'll see what happens.

59:50.766 --> 59:52.535
Tom, I think
you owe us an apology.

59:52.568 --> 59:54.537
No, I think they
owe us an apology, okay?

59:54.570 --> 59:56.340
They wanna make a hoax video,

59:56.373 --> 59:57.606
they owe us an apology, Chris,

59:57.640 --> 59:59.775
and that's all I wanted.

59:59.808 --> 01:00:01.477
And I'm gonna get it.
- Tom, are you listening

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:02.345
to yourself?

01:00:02.378 --> 01:00:04.879
They owe us an apology?

01:00:04.912 --> 01:00:07.383
Oh my God, you're fucking losing
your mind

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:08.684
over this.

01:00:08.717 --> 01:00:09.552
- Yeah.
- We're gettin'

01:00:09.585 --> 01:00:11.287
great video, Chris, okay?

01:00:12.588 --> 01:00:14.322
- That's right.
- A bunch of, yeah, exactly,

01:00:14.356 --> 01:00:17.326
you drag all of us out here
in the middle of nowhere.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:18.461
Shit.

01:00:18.494 --> 01:00:20.662
Everything's gotta be perfect
for you.

01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:23.265
- Yeah, Tom, this is
all about me right now.

01:01:06.507 --> 01:01:07.474
Yeah, can you,

01:01:07.508 --> 01:01:11.245
can you grab that, thanks.
- I got your bag.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.857
Hey.
- Hi!

01:01:25.858 --> 01:01:26.792
Hi, hi, hi.

01:01:28.594 --> 01:01:30.597
Oh it's good to see you.

01:01:32.632 --> 01:01:34.500
- These are the guys.

01:01:34.534 --> 01:01:36.469
- Emma, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:36.502 --> 01:01:38.238
- Hi there, Chris.
- Hi, Emma.

01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:39.071
- Hey, Emma.
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:39.104 --> 01:01:40.606
- Thank you so much for having
us.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.642
- Oh.
- That's Griffin, sorry about.

01:01:42.675 --> 01:01:43.476
- Uh, yeah.
- Hi.

01:01:43.509 --> 01:01:45.645
- We'll explain a lot.
- Okay, hi.

01:01:45.678 --> 01:01:46.879
- Hi.
- Emma.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:48.980
Hi, nice to see you,
sorry.

01:01:49.013 --> 01:01:50.983
I don't, I've got two hands on
the camera.

01:01:51.016 --> 01:01:51.951
- I wanna close the door

01:01:51.984 --> 01:01:53.919
to stop you from freezing.

01:01:53.953 --> 01:01:55.888
Tofu for you, right?

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.256
You've got it.

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.624
Abbi.
- Thank you for all of this.

01:01:59.658 --> 01:02:00.693
- Of course.
- Abbi.

01:02:00.726 --> 01:02:01.394
- No problem.
- Thanks, thank you.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:03.363
- This is amazing, thank you.

01:02:03.396 --> 01:02:04.796
- You're okay with the
cameras and everything, no?

01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:05.730
- Not really.

01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:06.665
- Well.
- Why are you asking

01:02:06.698 --> 01:02:07.932
her if she's okay with the?

01:02:07.966 --> 01:02:09.133
I, thank you for allowing us--

01:02:09.167 --> 01:02:09.968
- Are you saying you're forcing
somebody to do something?

01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:11.003
- I'm forcing her--
- Oh wow, God,

01:02:11.036 --> 01:02:13.438
I thought that was a
cardinal sin around here--

01:02:13.472 --> 01:02:15.440
- That's fine.
- Thank you for being honest.

01:02:15.474 --> 01:02:16.608
- Yeah, that's good.
- That's okay.

01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:17.309
- Did you hear what he just
said?

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:18.877
- But, um--
- I'm your boss.

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:20.544
I'm your boss.
- You're also my friend.

01:02:20.578 --> 01:02:21.813
- Yeah.
- Okay, so, Emma,

01:02:21.846 --> 01:02:24.616
what we're doing, gentlemen,

01:02:24.649 --> 01:02:27.918
is we are here to try and expose
a bunch

01:02:28.852 --> 01:02:30.688
of creepy people--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:31.555
No, no, no.

01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:32.524
You know what?

01:02:32.557 --> 01:02:33.492
Thank you for your hospitality.

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:34.493
All you need to know
is what brought us here

01:02:34.526 --> 01:02:36.427
for us has something to
do with a missing girl.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.695
Girl that went missing, Tara
Rogers.

01:02:37.728 --> 01:02:39.029
That's the end of it.

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:40.531
Tara Rogers,
girl that went missing.

01:02:40.564 --> 01:02:42.734
- Tara Rogers.
- She disappeared.

01:02:42.767 --> 01:02:44.902
Like two years ago.
- I know her.

01:02:44.935 --> 01:02:47.571
You never heard,
wait, wait, you know her?

01:02:47.605 --> 01:02:49.573
- I mean, we weren't friends,

01:02:49.607 --> 01:02:51.575
but I met her once.

01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:52.743
When she went missing,

01:02:52.776 --> 01:02:54.478
all the old ladies over there,

01:02:54.512 --> 01:02:56.314
there was the rumor that,

01:02:56.347 --> 01:02:58.282
you know, she was sleeping
around--

01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:00.417
- Was like slutty.

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.284
- I guess.
- I mean, I'm sorry,

01:03:01.318 --> 01:03:02.385
I'm not sayin' that.

01:03:02.419 --> 01:03:04.288
That's not a nice word.
- Let her finish, go ahead.

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:05.489
Continue, please.
- Slutty.

01:03:05.523 --> 01:03:06.390
- Basically that.
- You remember

01:03:06.424 --> 01:03:08.658
what she looked like, right?
- Mm hmm.

01:03:08.691 --> 01:03:09.592
Would you pull up the
video?

01:03:09.626 --> 01:03:10.560
We're gonna show you a video
real quick.

01:03:10.593 --> 01:03:12.495
I just want you to tell me if
this is her

01:03:12.529 --> 01:03:13.964
in the video.
- All right, sure.

01:03:13.997 --> 01:03:14.832
All right, check it out.

01:03:14.865 --> 01:03:16.032
- Here.

01:03:16.065 --> 01:03:17.467
See the girl walkin' on
his grave?

01:03:20.503 --> 01:03:21.871
- I don't think so, no.

01:03:21.904 --> 01:03:23.805
No, it doesn't look like her.
- You don't think so.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.508
- She met her once, Tom.

01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:27.677
Is that the authority?

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:28.545
Now it's your fault, I
understand.

01:03:28.578 --> 01:03:30.313
- Cheers, this is amazing.

01:03:30.347 --> 01:03:30.980
- Thanks for everything.

01:03:31.013 --> 01:03:32.013
You have a beautiful house.

01:03:32.047 --> 01:03:32.681
Do this.

01:03:32.714 --> 01:03:34.617
You don't, you can't cross.

01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:36.853
- You cannot cross.
- You cannot cross.

01:03:36.886 --> 01:03:39.055
You have to look into each other
eyes,

01:03:39.088 --> 01:03:41.323
or no sex for seven years.

01:03:41.357 --> 01:03:42.458
- Jeez, and I'm checkin' my
phone.

01:03:42.491 --> 01:03:43.525
- What a consequence.

01:03:43.559 --> 01:03:45.061
- Quick, everyone look.

01:03:45.094 --> 01:03:46.396
- That escalated quickly.

01:03:46.429 --> 01:03:47.397
I need this, I need this, I need
this.

01:03:47.429 --> 01:03:49.731
Yeah, I forgot
to mention that before.

01:03:49.765 --> 01:03:50.832
Okay, ready?

01:03:50.866 --> 01:03:52.534
- And then, no, Tom!

01:03:52.568 --> 01:03:53.502
- Tom, you can't look

01:03:53.535 --> 01:03:54.370
at your phone.
- Two seconds, two seconds.

01:03:54.403 --> 01:03:56.372
Oh, sorry.
- Seven years without sex.

01:03:56.405 --> 01:03:57.072
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:03:57.105 --> 01:03:57.773
- Wouldn't be the first time.

01:03:57.806 --> 01:03:58.474
And then you drink it.

01:03:58.507 --> 01:03:59.174
You're supposed to slam it, but.

01:04:05.112 --> 01:04:06.415
- Ah, yeah.

01:04:06.448 --> 01:04:07.082
- Wow!

01:04:07.115 --> 01:04:08.417
Hello, hello!

01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:09.851
Hello!

01:04:09.885 --> 01:04:11.052
She's the most fun
person here,

01:04:11.086 --> 01:04:12.887
I've just discovered.
- I quit.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.689
- All right, I'd like to say
something.

01:04:14.722 --> 01:04:15.523
I'd like to say something.

01:04:15.556 --> 01:04:16.792
Thank you for having us in your
home

01:04:16.825 --> 01:04:18.360
and being so hospitable.

01:04:18.394 --> 01:04:20.495
And I'd also like to say, for
real,

01:04:20.528 --> 01:04:22.497
since you know, just to make
sure

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:23.531
there's no elephants in the
room,

01:04:23.564 --> 01:04:24.932
I'm sorry that we went at night.

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.735
I should've told you that
we were gonna do that.

01:04:26.768 --> 01:04:28.536
I'm sorry, Chris.
- I accept your apology.

01:04:28.569 --> 01:04:29.437
Thank you.

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.372
Great, the business
continues!

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:32.740
Nice!

01:04:32.773 --> 01:04:34.875
When are we gonna
talk about my life, Tom?

01:04:34.909 --> 01:04:36.610
This is why we didn't let him
have, like,

01:04:36.643 --> 01:04:40.415
the whole video will
just be of a, of a tower.

01:04:40.448 --> 01:04:41.549
- I think it's gonna fall.
- He's got the kind of

01:04:41.582 --> 01:04:44.518
Darth Vadar thing goin'.
- He's providing wind effects.

01:04:44.551 --> 01:04:46.119
- Hey, um--
- Wait, hang on, hang on.

01:04:46.152 --> 01:04:47.053
- You called it quits.
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:04:47.086 --> 01:04:48.255
One second.

01:04:48.288 --> 01:04:49.924
- It's okay, no, I'm not gonna
call you out or anything,

01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.558
but I just wanna make sure that
I know

01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:52.492
what we're doing.

01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:54.461
He, he says he's not gonna come
tomorrow,

01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:55.862
and do the videos, okay?

01:04:55.895 --> 01:04:56.796
Just, just me and you maybe?

01:04:56.830 --> 01:04:57.932
I prefer not to.

01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.098
- Yeah.

01:04:59.132 --> 01:05:01.768
- Griff, I just don't wanna,

01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:04.638
I just don't, I don't wanna.

01:05:04.671 --> 01:05:06.972
- I'm fine with it.

01:05:07.005 --> 01:05:07.773
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:05:07.806 --> 01:05:09.042
- You have to slam it now.
- Okay.

01:05:09.075 --> 01:05:10.109
Oh jeez, here we go.

01:05:10.143 --> 01:05:12.178
I think I'm
already a little bit tipsy.

01:05:12.211 --> 01:05:14.614
I can't imagine why.

01:05:14.648 --> 01:05:16.782
I can't imagine why.

01:05:16.815 --> 01:05:18.083
- Love it.
- Cheers.

01:05:18.116 --> 01:05:19.719
So now we have to toast
again.

01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:20.587
- And someone else

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.521
has to slam it.

01:05:22.855 --> 01:05:24.590
Oh, right on me.

01:05:24.623 --> 01:05:25.724
Thanks.

01:05:32.164 --> 01:05:33.566
No, he'll get over
it.

01:05:33.599 --> 01:05:34.967
We'll get good footage.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.569
- Look, because at the end of
the day,

01:05:36.602 --> 01:05:37.970
it's all about the success of
Gigaler,

01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:41.206
because I think if and
when the company blows up,

01:05:41.239 --> 01:05:43.776
you, too, could get a house
like this one right here.

01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:44.710
Right there.
- Oh.

01:05:44.743 --> 01:05:45.578
- Yep, yep.

01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:47.044
That could be yours, all
of it.

01:05:47.078 --> 01:05:49.547
All to my own, my
own self?

01:05:49.581 --> 01:05:50.716
- Yep.

01:05:50.749 --> 01:05:52.551
Well, maybe a little
bit.

01:05:52.585 --> 01:05:54.052
I'm not sharing with
anybody.

01:05:54.086 --> 01:05:54.952
- Look at this.

01:05:54.986 --> 01:05:56.921
- Holy cow.
- Oh my God.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:59.557
- All those birds.
- Lemme roll the window down.

01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:00.459
Jeez.

01:06:01.627 --> 01:06:04.028
Listen to 'em,
listen to 'em.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.909
We're going to announce who we
are, yes?

01:06:17.942 --> 01:06:19.710
Yes, Griffin, I'm
going to do the same thing

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:20.944
that I did last night.
- All right,

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:21.378
I just wanted to make sure.
- I was never gonna be a jerk

01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:22.614
to these people.

01:06:22.647 --> 01:06:23.581
It's just confronting them.
- Anyway, I guess I wanna make

01:06:23.615 --> 01:06:25.883
sure that we just--
- In fact, I was ready

01:06:25.917 --> 01:06:27.618
last night, Ion't even
know if I'm ready right now.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:31.856
Okay, do you need
to practice with me first?

01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:34.225
This one's for Chris.
- Yeah.

01:06:37.828 --> 01:06:38.695
Come on.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:46.102
Talk to you, I would like to
talk to you

01:06:46.136 --> 01:06:49.105
about a video that was
submitted to the website.

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.674
I wanna talk to you about it.

01:06:55.846 --> 01:06:56.680
I'd like to talk to you about a
video

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.549
.

01:06:59.582 --> 01:07:01.016
I'd like to talk to you
about .

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:16.832
Do you hear
anything?

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:21.971
- No.
- Here we go again.

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.239
I know.

01:07:27.276 --> 01:07:29.612
- Let's try the side door.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.120
Ah.

01:07:42.957 --> 01:07:44.694
No, no, no, no, no, one second.

01:07:45.561 --> 01:07:48.863
- For God's sake, Tom.
- Chill out.

01:07:48.897 --> 01:07:50.565
Hello?

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:51.833
All right,
no one's here, let's go.

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:52.667
- Now or never.

01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:55.604
Tom, are you kidding
me?

01:07:55.637 --> 01:07:56.270
Tom.

01:07:58.873 --> 01:08:00.008
Hello?

01:08:00.942 --> 01:08:02.209
Don't do this, don't
do this.

01:08:02.242 --> 01:08:03.844
Let's not do this.

01:08:05.145 --> 01:08:06.014
Tom.

01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:08.282
Look at this, look at
this.

01:08:08.316 --> 01:08:09.818
- Come here.

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:19.926
Can you see in there?

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.694
- No.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:08:25.165 --> 01:08:27.033
Holy shit.

01:08:28.335 --> 01:08:29.169
Oh God.

01:08:40.013 --> 01:08:42.148
- No, no, come on.

01:08:43.314 --> 01:08:44.149
This is stupid.
- Griff,

01:08:44.183 --> 01:08:45.984
there's nobody here.

01:08:46.018 --> 01:08:46.953
How do you know?

01:08:46.986 --> 01:08:48.087
- There, there's no furniture,

01:08:48.121 --> 01:08:48.889
there's no nothing!

01:08:48.921 --> 01:08:51.691
There's no pictures on the
walls.

01:08:51.724 --> 01:08:53.158
Oh!
- There was a light on

01:08:53.192 --> 01:08:53.826
last night, Tom.
- Look at this, look at this.

01:08:53.859 --> 01:08:56.028
Someone's here.

01:08:56.062 --> 01:08:56.929
- Look.

01:08:58.064 --> 01:08:59.031
A dead rat.

01:08:59.064 --> 01:09:01.934
Yeah, I'm sure they're--
- Well that's the cue

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:03.102
to leave.
- I'm sure they're here.

01:09:03.135 --> 01:09:03.770
That's the cue.

01:09:03.803 --> 01:09:06.638
Let's do the cue and leave.

01:09:06.671 --> 01:09:08.140
That's an idea.
- Oh.

01:09:08.174 --> 01:09:11.010
Okay, check this out now.

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:12.845
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

01:09:12.879 --> 01:09:15.145
Look at this, okay.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:16.915
Yeah, that's creepy enough,
right?

01:09:24.354 --> 01:09:25.991
Hello?

01:09:26.024 --> 01:09:27.425
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:36.902
Griff, Griff, come here.

01:09:39.437 --> 01:09:40.305
'Kay, shh.

01:09:42.439 --> 01:09:43.841
Wait, where are you
going?

01:09:43.875 --> 01:09:45.943
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:45.975 --> 01:09:48.212
Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:48.245 --> 01:09:50.148
No, we don't go upstairs.

01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.950
No, no, no, Tom.

01:09:51.983 --> 01:09:52.649
Tom.

01:09:52.684 --> 01:09:55.185
I insist we stop.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.387
Jesus God.

01:09:57.421 --> 01:09:59.123
Oh my God.

01:09:59.156 --> 01:10:00.091
Don't do that.

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.225
No, come here.

01:10:01.258 --> 01:10:02.292
I don't wanna
hear oh my Gods from you.

01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:03.160
- Come up the stairs.

01:10:03.193 --> 01:10:04.394
You gotta check this out.

01:10:07.064 --> 01:10:11.135
My mom's gonna
be so mad at you, Tom.

01:10:12.336 --> 01:10:13.804
- Look.

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:15.339
Look at this.

01:10:15.372 --> 01:10:17.106
Yeah, look familiar?

01:10:18.241 --> 01:10:20.276
This was in the screamer video,
right?

01:10:20.309 --> 01:10:21.912
This is the bed.

01:10:21.946 --> 01:10:23.113
This is the bed, this is it.

01:10:23.147 --> 01:10:24.982
This is like a set or something
like that.

01:10:25.015 --> 01:10:26.983
Well why is the
light on?

01:10:27.016 --> 01:10:28.151
- Because, Griffin, it's a set.

01:10:28.184 --> 01:10:29.418
This is where they're makin' the
videos.

01:10:29.452 --> 01:10:31.087
This is it, this is all a hoax.

01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:35.224
This is all a hoax.

01:10:37.293 --> 01:10:39.028
That, that's my car.

01:10:40.163 --> 01:10:40.996
All right, I'll be right back.

01:10:41.029 --> 01:10:42.231
- Who, whoa, whoa.
- Just stay here.

01:10:42.265 --> 01:10:44.167
Come on, two seconds, two
seconds.

01:10:59.514 --> 01:11:01.449
Now explain to me

01:11:01.483 --> 01:11:02.919
how a car alarm goes off

01:11:02.952 --> 01:11:04.053
when the both of us are up here.

01:11:04.087 --> 01:11:04.754
This is what I'm talkin' about.

01:11:04.788 --> 01:11:06.254
This is shit I don't wanna do.

01:11:06.288 --> 01:11:08.490
I don't wanna do this shit.

01:11:08.523 --> 01:11:10.125
Tom is like crazy.

01:11:16.932 --> 01:11:18.767
Just don't feel like we
should be here anyways.

01:11:18.801 --> 01:11:20.968
It's just like, it's crazy.

01:11:29.376 --> 01:11:30.244
Tom?

01:11:33.447 --> 01:11:34.316
Tom!

01:11:35.951 --> 01:11:38.352
Okay, I'm done, I'm
completely done right now.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.074
Griff, let's
get the hell outta here.

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.349
Dude, dude, do not mess around
right now.

01:12:16.556 --> 01:12:18.558
Griff, I'm serious, man.

01:12:22.996 --> 01:12:24.130
Oh Jesus, if you're doin' this,

01:12:24.164 --> 01:12:26.599
I swear to God, Griffin, I swear
to God.

01:12:38.378 --> 01:12:40.046
Holy shit!

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.380
What the hell?

01:12:47.253 --> 01:12:48.587
I mean, I just
wanna know if you're seeing

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.889
a woman--
- Yeah, I am.

01:12:49.922 --> 01:12:50.555
Uh, Chris.

01:12:50.589 --> 01:12:52.591
Did you hear from Tom yet?

01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:53.558
- No.

01:12:53.592 --> 01:12:57.229
Uh, still no answer for
the past five hours.

01:12:58.397 --> 01:13:01.233
Uh, about, so.
- Okay, Chris, listen,

01:13:01.266 --> 01:13:02.601
I know, I know you might be
frustrated

01:13:02.634 --> 01:13:05.536
with Tom or, or whatever, but,
um,

01:13:05.569 --> 01:13:07.005
I wanna show you something on
the footage

01:13:07.038 --> 01:13:08.941
that Griffin dumped last night.

01:13:08.974 --> 01:13:09.975
Um, I don't,

01:13:11.043 --> 01:13:11.944
I'm not trying to freak you out,

01:13:11.977 --> 01:13:13.577
and I, I promise I'm not being
paranoid.

01:13:13.611 --> 01:13:16.280
I just want you to come
look at something, okay?

01:13:16.314 --> 01:13:17.916
- Yeah, of course, Emma,

01:13:17.949 --> 01:13:19.351
please, come look.

01:13:22.586 --> 01:13:24.555
- Yeah.

01:13:24.588 --> 01:13:25.957
I'm gonna go back for you guys,

01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:27.458
but

01:13:27.491 --> 01:13:29.593
it, it's, it's someone.

01:13:29.627 --> 01:13:31.195
Someone was with us last night.

01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:33.164
- Oh.
- Oh jeez.

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:35.166
- Look, yeah, I'll go back.

01:13:35.199 --> 01:13:37.100
It's tricky, it's so fast.

01:13:37.134 --> 01:13:38.401
Right.

01:13:41.072 --> 01:13:42.506
- Oh my God.
- Jesus.

01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:43.374
Look how pronounced
that is.

01:13:44.341 --> 01:13:45.008
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, wait.

01:13:45.042 --> 01:13:46.509
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

01:13:46.543 --> 01:13:49.146
- Yeah.

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:50.514
"Sorry, can't talk.

01:13:50.548 --> 01:13:53.416
"Can you meet us at Tara's?"

01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:54.317
That was Tom?

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:55.285
- "House right now."

01:13:55.318 --> 01:13:56.987
Dude, are you okay?

01:14:04.427 --> 01:14:05.295
He's.

01:14:06.396 --> 01:14:07.464
"Yes, we are.

01:14:07.497 --> 01:14:09.431
"With Tara and Francis.

01:14:09.465 --> 01:14:11.201
"Sorry, can't talk, can you
meet us at Tara's house?"

01:14:11.234 --> 01:14:12.069
"Dude, are you okay?"

01:14:12.102 --> 01:14:14.604
"Yes, we are with Tara and
Francis."

01:14:14.637 --> 01:14:16.238
Um.

01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:17.940
Emma, would you mind driving us
there?

01:14:17.974 --> 01:14:19.441
- No, it's no problem.

01:14:19.475 --> 01:14:20.643
- We can

01:14:20.677 --> 01:14:22.112
get him and Griffin

01:14:22.145 --> 01:14:24.246
and we can leave you be.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.182
Yeah, at least they're okay.

01:14:26.215 --> 01:14:29.085
This is like no man's land out
here.

01:14:29.118 --> 01:14:30.186
- Yeah.
- Yep.

01:14:31.321 --> 01:14:32.554
Emma, is there
like a light you can turn on?

01:14:32.588 --> 01:14:33.522
Abbi?
- Oh, sure.

01:14:33.555 --> 01:14:34.323
- Oh, okay.
- Don't worry about it, Emma.

01:14:34.356 --> 01:14:36.125
You drive.
- Yeah, you can drive.

01:14:36.158 --> 01:14:38.060
Yeah, thank you, oh, there we
go.

01:14:38.094 --> 01:14:39.995
Now we can see everyone, mm hmm.

01:14:40.028 --> 01:14:41.597
- Oh good.
- That's great.

01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:43.065
Maybe I'll turn it back off.

01:14:43.099 --> 01:14:45.701
Nah, it's good, it's
good.

01:14:45.734 --> 01:14:48.536
We close, Abb?
- Yeah, it's just about

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:50.605
a quarter mile away.

01:14:50.638 --> 01:14:52.241
Is it gonna be on
the right or on the left.

01:14:52.274 --> 01:14:54.276
It's gonna be on the
right.

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:55.111
Thank you again, Emma,

01:14:55.144 --> 01:14:58.013
for driving us out.
- No problem.

01:14:58.046 --> 01:14:59.447
If you guys wanna stay one more
night.

01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.982
No, we don't.

01:15:01.016 --> 01:15:03.019
We don't wanna do that to ya.

01:15:03.052 --> 01:15:05.453
I think you've had enough of
that.

01:15:06.721 --> 01:15:07.588
Oh.

01:15:09.757 --> 01:15:10.591
Oh.

01:15:10.625 --> 01:15:13.561
Tom says to come in the front
door.

01:15:15.763 --> 01:15:17.965
"Be quiet, don't worry."

01:15:19.666 --> 01:15:21.468
Oh shit, guys.

01:15:23.103 --> 01:15:23.738
I don't know.

01:15:23.771 --> 01:15:25.006
He's being cryptic, Tom.

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:27.241
But he says this is the one.

01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:29.009
- I don't know.

01:15:29.043 --> 01:15:30.610
- I don't know.

01:15:30.644 --> 01:15:32.579
This is it up here on
the right.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:33.547
- Oh, oh, okay.
- Uh, yes.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.715
- This is Tom's car.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:15:34.749 --> 01:15:36.483
- It's the white one.

01:15:36.516 --> 01:15:38.452
It is.

01:15:38.485 --> 01:15:40.254
Waiting for the fender.

01:15:40.287 --> 01:15:41.388
There it is.

01:15:41.421 --> 01:15:43.123
- Okay.
- Emma, Abbi,

01:15:43.822 --> 01:15:45.159
let's do this.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:46.826
Can I film, though,

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.794
so you guys can?

01:15:47.827 --> 01:15:49.463
Yeah, please, I don't
wanna stand

01:15:49.496 --> 01:15:50.297
in front of the camera.

01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:52.298
- So here, you just hold it.
- Okay.

01:15:52.331 --> 01:15:53.466
- This is the zoom in.
- Yeah.

01:15:53.499 --> 01:15:55.402
- Zoom in and zoom out.
- Okay.

01:15:55.435 --> 01:15:58.705
And it'll focus
pretty much on its own.

01:15:58.738 --> 01:16:00.339
- Great.
- So let's

01:16:01.207 --> 01:16:02.075
do this.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.451
Watch out, the steps
are a little slippery.

01:16:12.485 --> 01:16:14.753
He said it's unlocked.

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:15.654
Okay, ready?

01:16:15.688 --> 01:16:16.789
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:16:26.799 --> 01:16:27.633
'Kay.

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:40.812
Tom?

01:16:44.516 --> 01:16:45.383
Tom.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:47.552
What?

01:16:53.691 --> 01:16:55.726
Oh my God.

01:16:57.729 --> 01:16:58.563
Tara?

01:17:04.535 --> 01:17:05.369
Tara?

01:17:16.813 --> 01:17:17.681
Tara.

01:17:20.217 --> 01:17:23.220
Oh, what the fuck?

01:17:23.254 --> 01:17:24.288
What the fuck?

01:17:35.598 --> 01:17:36.532
Griffin!

01:17:47.577 --> 01:17:49.111
Help me!

01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:55.618
Someone help me!
