08:56.880 --> 08:59.620
The girl from TV who's got
Cash Mooney all sprung.

08:59.620 --> 09:03.330

recognize her with makeup on.

Concealer and blush,
Zoey.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.710
That's all
it would have taken. God.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.920
Hey, so I bet you're hoping
that when Cash gets drafted,

09:09.920 --> 09:12.460
you get to go somewhere fly
like Miami or like New York.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.170
Ooh,

gonna follow him.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.290
Of course
she's gonna follow him.

09:23.290 --> 09:25.170
Any girl would follow him.
I mean, can I follow him?

No,
Ana's right.

Dude, this is not
regular pinga.

This is
$100 million pinga.

09:34.790 --> 09:35.710
Baller pinga.

09:46.330 --> 09:48.710
I can
make my decision then.

09:48.710 --> 09:51.120
Wait.
So, six months from now,

09:51.120 --> 09:52.920
you think you're gonna be
any less attached to him?

09:54.080 --> 09:55.290
I don't know.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.080
I didn't even really
think about it like that.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.500
Well,
maybe you should.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.920
Because if
you're not gonna go,

still in this?

Nomi, as my one
normal friend,

what do you think?

10:07.580 --> 10:08.580
What do I think?

10:08.580 --> 10:09.880
You really wanna know
what I think?

10:09.880 --> 10:12.750
I think, once again,
you've managed to hijack

10:12.750 --> 10:15.830
a perfectly nice night
and make it about you.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.750
Wait.
Did I miss something?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.750
Yeah, how about
the last six texts

10:19.750 --> 10:21.750
that I sent you about what
I was going through with Dave?

10:21.750 --> 10:23.460
Dave? Da--

10:23.460 --> 10:24.880
Oh, right!
Dave!

10:24.880 --> 10:25.830
How is he doing?

10:25.830 --> 10:27.250
We broke up.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.880
But I guess it didn't have
anything to do with you,

10:29.880 --> 10:31.330
so you didn't care.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.920
No. God. No, no.
Nomi, I didn't know.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.080
I'm so sorry
that I've just been --

10:35.080 --> 10:36.250
You should be sorry.

10:36.250 --> 10:38.290
And you know what?
You should go.

10:38.290 --> 10:39.580
Follow Cash.

10:39.580 --> 10:42.500
I mean, your head is already
so far up his ass anyway,

10:42.500 --> 10:43.880
it wouldn't really
make a difference

10:43.880 --> 10:47.420
if you stuck around here
or not.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.960
God, what happened
to the sun shining brighter

10:51.960 --> 10:53.830
and the birds chirping louder?

10:53.830 --> 10:55.750
I mean, are all the birds dead?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.210
Who killed the birds?

10:57.210 --> 10:59.120
And I thought being in love

10:59.120 --> 11:01.540
was gonna make
all my problems easier,

11:01.540 --> 11:04.670
but it just feels like
it's making things worse.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.620
Where the hell have you been,
young lady?

11:09.620 --> 11:10.670
Oh.

How did you get in here?

11:13.880 --> 11:16.080
Why are you not returning
my calls and my texts, Zoey?

11:16.080 --> 11:19.000

I've been busy?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.920
Well, apparently,

Z-Zo, I-I can't control
where I end up.

17:21.170 --> 17:22.830
Yeah.
No. No, I know.

17:22.830 --> 17:25.580
I-I was just kidding.
Kind of.

17:25.580 --> 17:27.040
Kind of?

17:27.040 --> 17:30.250
Look, Cash, I'm just trying
to think big picture

17:30.250 --> 17:33.120
the way everyone's
on our asses to.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.250
A year ago,
big picture

17:35.250 --> 17:37.710
was me getting to college
and playing well.

17:37.710 --> 17:40.120
I finally made that
happen, and now it's,
like, all new pressures.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.380
And I don't want
to add to that.

17:42.380 --> 17:44.750
So you're saying
you don't want to come with me?

17:44.750 --> 17:47.290
Wait. What?
No! No.

17:47.290 --> 17:49.380
Where's --
Where's that coming from?

17:49.380 --> 17:51.420
I just said I did.

17:51.420 --> 17:52.750
Wait.

17:52.750 --> 17:55.250
Is that
what you want?

17:55.250 --> 17:58.330
For me
to let you off the hook?

17:58.330 --> 17:59.960
I just want things
to be easy.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.250
Yeah,
and they can be easy

18:02.250 --> 18:04.790
if you're 100% sure
of what you want.

18:04.790 --> 18:07.250
You're 100% sure,
yeah?

18:07.250 --> 18:08.880

18:08.880 --> 18:10.830
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding me.

18:10.830 --> 18:12.250
Look, Zo,
I love you.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.250
You know that.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.790
And if this was
a year from now

18:14.790 --> 18:17.620
and I knew where I was
and what my life was like there,

18:17.620 --> 18:20.250
I'd be able to give you
a head's-up about what
you're stepping into.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.830
And why the hell
didn't you think of that

18:21.830 --> 18:23.380
before you asked me
to go with you

18:23.380 --> 18:25.420
on national television?!
Because I meant it!

18:25.420 --> 18:26.670
Do you still?

18:26.670 --> 18:29.580
Yes, but...

18:29.580 --> 18:30.670
No!

18:30.670 --> 18:32.420
No buts,
because "but" isn't good enough

18:32.420 --> 18:34.830
for a huge,
life-changing decision!

18:34.830 --> 18:37.250
I was about to leave my family
and my home!

18:37.250 --> 18:38.330
I know.

18:38.330 --> 18:40.830
I know.
And I'm sorry.

18:40.830 --> 18:42.830
I'm just as confused
as you are.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.500
This whole thing
is new to me and --

18:44.500 --> 18:45.620
Yeah.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.250
I-I don't know
what to expect.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.420
And I --

18:48.420 --> 18:52.210
Neither do I, but I was willing
to take the chance.

18:52.210 --> 18:53.620
I just don't want
to break your heart.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.250
It's a little too late
for that.

18:55.250 --> 18:57.420
You know what?
It's time for you to go.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.670
Zoey, come on --

18:58.670 --> 19:00.330
No,
just please go.

19:10.290 --> 19:12.420
Goodbye, Zoey.

19:29.290 --> 19:30.790
Is Ana around?

19:30.790 --> 19:34.250
She got this dope new
track jacket I wanted to borrow.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.330
No.
She isn't here.

19:36.330 --> 19:37.420
Cool.

19:37.420 --> 19:41.210
I'll just take it
without asking, then.

19:43.420 --> 19:45.790
Not that I care,
but...

19:45.790 --> 19:47.210
are you crying?

19:47.210 --> 19:48.830
No.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.040
Good.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.290
'Cause if you were,
I wouldn't care.

19:56.670 --> 19:58.420
I know I seem like
a cold bitch,

19:58.420 --> 20:00.040

walk out of this room

leaving you crying alone
into a comforter.

20:04.580 --> 20:06.620
It might be minute.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.250
What's going on?

20:09.290 --> 20:10.620
Is it Cash?

20:10.620 --> 20:12.000
Yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.920
What happened?

20:13.920 --> 20:15.580
We broke up.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.120
Oh, honey.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.960
I'm sorry I've been
so selfish lately.

20:20.960 --> 20:23.420
I just feel
so stupid.
No.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.580
You -- Okay, you have nothing
to feel stupid about, okay?

20:25.580 --> 20:28.880
This love shit hurts,
is all.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.620
Can I say one thing?

20:30.620 --> 20:33.420
I'm really glad
you're not following him.

20:33.420 --> 20:35.620
I know we're kind of
not speaking right now,

20:35.620 --> 20:38.420
but this place would really suck
without you.

20:38.420 --> 20:40.880
Thank you.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.580
Can I say
one more thing?

20:45.580 --> 20:46.790
Yeah.

20:46.790 --> 20:49.920
You sound like my grandpa
when you blow your nose.

20:51.790 --> 20:54.750
I hate you.
