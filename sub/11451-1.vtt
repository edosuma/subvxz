04:18.009 --> 04:19.135
Hi.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.511
I finished your book.

04:23.181 --> 04:24.639
I finished your book.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.100
You don't have to sign.

04:26.184 --> 04:27.476
I know you can read my lips,

04:27.559 --> 04:28.936
but I am getting better.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.020
Better.

04:30.772 --> 04:32.689
- I um... I want to practise.
- Cool.

04:33.440 --> 04:36.235
Taking another class with John.

04:36.318 --> 04:37.486
- John?
- It's fun!

04:38.196 --> 04:41.908
I am way better at understanding it
than actually doing it, but...

04:43.034 --> 04:44.786
So, what did you think?

04:44.869 --> 04:46.954
What did I... What did I think?

04:48.747 --> 04:50.249
- I loved it.
- Thank you.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.332
I um...

04:52.126 --> 04:54.461
I loved Riley.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.963
I loved Erin.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.465
- Thank you.
- They were great characters.

04:59.258 --> 05:02.552
I tried to guess the ending.

05:03.095 --> 05:07.225
I am usually on point with that
sort of thing, but I was way off!

05:07.975 --> 05:09.768
How did you do that?
How do you...?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.520
How do you come up with that?

05:12.104 --> 05:15.565
My mom calls it "writer brain."

05:15.649 --> 05:16.775
Makes me crazy.

05:17.317 --> 05:21.823
Any possible outcome
is like a movie in my head...

05:21.906 --> 05:23.615
with many endings.

05:23.698 --> 05:26.493
- A frustrating movie.
- [laughs]

05:27.161 --> 05:30.330
Hard to make the voices quiet.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.251
A voice?

05:34.168 --> 05:35.377
I have a voice in my mind.

05:37.504 --> 05:39.966
Does the voice sound like a kid?

05:41.926 --> 05:43.552
You were 13 when you got sick?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.556
It sounds like my mom.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.855
Whatever is going on in your brain,

05:53.938 --> 05:58.234
I think that you are a good storyteller.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.320
What?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.035
This means...

06:08.119 --> 06:09.828
kisser.

06:09.912 --> 06:10.912
[laughs]

06:10.955 --> 06:12.957
This means storyteller.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.418
Well,
I'm sure you're also a lovely kisser.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.208
I'm sorry.

06:56.292 --> 06:58.585
Fire alarm.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.672
God! That is one hell of a fire alarm!

07:02.756 --> 07:05.176
I have to feel the vibrations.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.053
That is why it is so loud.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.013
When I am sleeping,

07:09.096 --> 07:11.057
the vibrations will wake me up.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.100
Well, I imagine that would wake anyone.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.858
Oh! Cat?

07:22.567 --> 07:24.778
She is fine. Independent little bitch.

07:25.947 --> 07:27.656
She's a... She's a what?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.743
B-I-T-C-H.

07:31.826 --> 07:32.826

07:33.870 --> 07:34.704

07:34.788 --> 07:35.872

[pats leg]

07:43.546 --> 07:44.798
I am sorry about dinner.

07:46.342 --> 07:47.509
Do you want to come over?

07:48.219 --> 07:50.470
We can order in and watch a movie.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.597
John will be home in an hour,
so he can join.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.808
Have to work.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.019
I understand.

07:57.103 --> 07:58.103
I'm sorry.

07:58.770 --> 08:02.482
Thank you for...
for letting me borrow this.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.443
Keep it. I have got dozens upstairs.

08:05.902 --> 08:06.903
Thank you.

08:08.406 --> 08:10.740
I'll pop by tomorrow and brush up signs?

08:11.574 --> 08:12.826
I'm going to get good.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.910
I'm determined.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.746
- Kissing.
- Kissing.

08:16.830 --> 08:17.914
Storyteller.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.916

08:20.001 --> 08:21.002

But I'm not going to.

Not until it's time.

26:51.236 --> 26:53.028
When you wish you are dead -

26:53.113 --> 26:54.655
that's when I'll come inside.

Nod your head if you understand me.

Sarah?

52:21.848 --> 52:22.849
Sarah?

52:39.531 --> 52:42.159
- [intruder] On the ground!
- [neighbour] Whoa!

52:42.242 --> 52:44.037
[intruder] On the ground. Drop it!

52:44.120 --> 52:46.413
- It's just a phone.
- Drop it! Hands behind your head.

52:46.497 --> 52:49.208
- Take it easy. I'm a friend.
- Hands where I can see 'em.

52:49.291 --> 52:51.251
I don't want any trouble.
Just do what I say.

52:51.335 --> 52:52.796
My name is John Stanley.

52:52.879 --> 52:54.630
- I said, "On your knees," sir.
- OK!

52:54.714 --> 52:56.800
I'm a neighbour,
just looking for my girlfriend.

52:56.883 --> 52:59.426
- Show me some ID.
- It's in my wallet, OK? Take it easy.

52:59.510 --> 53:02.346
- Hands where I can see 'em.
- I'm just gonna go for my wallet.

53:02.429 --> 53:05.557
I'm gonna put my phone down
and reach for my wallet. Take it easy.

53:19.739 --> 53:21.281
- You live next door?
- Yes, sir.

53:22.408 --> 53:23.408
OK.

53:24.911 --> 53:25.911
OK.

53:29.040 --> 53:30.166
I am sorry to scare you.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.333
There has been a...

53:32.209 --> 53:33.209
Phew!

53:33.627 --> 53:34.921
Jesus! Um...

53:35.004 --> 53:37.757
- What the hell happened here?
- I don't know. Um...

53:37.841 --> 53:39.258
I responded to a call.

53:39.341 --> 53:42.302
I got here and found the place like this.
There was someone inside.

53:42.386 --> 53:44.471
He came running past me
and knocked me cold.

53:44.555 --> 53:47.599
I woke up without my phone,
my gun or my radio.

53:47.683 --> 53:48.893
I need to call for backup.

53:48.977 --> 53:51.311
- Do you know who lives here?
- Yeah, it's Maddie.

53:51.395 --> 53:52.981
Maddie Young. She's a friend of ours.

53:53.064 --> 53:54.065
Does she live alone?

53:54.149 --> 53:56.901
Yeah. My girlfriend comes here
all the time. I thought maybe...

53:56.985 --> 53:57.986
What is her name?

53:58.862 --> 54:00.362
It's Sarah. Sarah Greene.

54:00.947 --> 54:03.950
OK. Sarah. I'm sorry.
Can I use your phone to call for backup?

54:04.033 --> 54:05.659
I should have called it in already,

54:05.744 --> 54:08.121
but I just started this job,
and when I got here...

54:08.204 --> 54:11.040
- Are you police?
- Deputy. Just barely, though.

54:12.374 --> 54:14.753
I can call the Sheriff,
if I can just use your...?

54:17.964 --> 54:18.965
Here you go.

54:20.257 --> 54:21.257
Thanks.

54:27.723 --> 54:30.101
Yeah, I got a 7-19 here at 811 Fairhope.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.562
Signs of possible forced entry.
Suspect is at large on foot.

54:37.192 --> 54:39.651
No one else here,
but a neighbour just showed up.

54:40.945 --> 54:42.279
Yeah. OK.

54:43.572 --> 54:44.573
See you soon.

54:46.366 --> 54:47.493
Hey, did you see that?

54:52.539 --> 54:53.875
Yeah, I did.

54:56.252 --> 54:58.295
This girl, Maddie,
does she have a boyfriend?

54:59.546 --> 55:00.631
No, I don't think so.

55:01.381 --> 55:02.381
Hm.

55:02.424 --> 55:06.221
Family nearby? Anybody else that could
possibly have access to the house?

55:06.846 --> 55:09.431
No, she pretty much keeps to herself.

55:10.474 --> 55:12.227
- Is your arm OK?
- Oh, yeah.

55:12.811 --> 55:15.897
The guy just ploughed into me.
He hit me like a truck.

55:16.647 --> 55:20.860
He must have been...
well, just about your size, actually.

55:20.944 --> 55:22.028
You know, like a jock.

55:22.111 --> 55:23.238
Linebacker type.

55:24.197 --> 55:25.197
Scary guy.

55:27.158 --> 55:28.201
Can I get that back?

55:29.828 --> 55:30.829
The phone.

55:31.745 --> 55:32.579
Oh!

55:32.663 --> 55:33.705
[chuckles]

55:33.789 --> 55:35.875
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

55:35.959 --> 55:39.170
So stupid of me. Force of habit.

55:47.262 --> 55:50.722
You said you responded to a call.
Was that from Maddie?

55:51.640 --> 55:53.893
From the dispatcher... actually.

55:54.768 --> 55:58.314
They said someone had called it in.
I just assumed it was the resident.

55:59.023 --> 56:03.069
Yeah, because she wouldn't be able
to make that call. She's deaf and mute.

56:05.154 --> 56:06.154
Huh.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.871
Well, I guess it must have been
your girlfriend who made the call.

56:18.167 --> 56:19.168

[panting]

56:38.604 --> 56:39.813
[crossbow clatters]

56:51.326 --> 56:52.784
So, deaf mute, huh?

56:53.744 --> 56:54.745
Pretty rough.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.831
Has she always been unable to hear?

56:59.750 --> 57:01.127
No, not always.

57:02.836 --> 57:05.173
Since she was a teenager, I think.
Meningitis.

57:10.261 --> 57:16.142
Still, to live alone like this...
she must be able to get by.

57:16.225 --> 57:17.726
I can't swear to it, but...

57:19.020 --> 57:22.941
...I'm pretty sure she has a spare key
in that planter on the porch down there.

57:24.691 --> 57:25.985
Wouldn't that be great?

57:26.069 --> 57:27.069
Yeah.

57:28.779 --> 57:29.613
Just...?

57:29.696 --> 57:32.241
Yeah, it's right down there,
on that corner.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.454
So, who do you think it was?

57:38.373 --> 57:39.915
Like, a burglar?

57:39.999 --> 57:42.751
- I hope it wasn't something worse.
- I am sure they are fine.

57:42.834 --> 57:45.380
If they called it in,
they probably got the hell out of here.

57:46.297 --> 57:47.881
Trashed her car pretty good, huh?

57:49.092 --> 57:51.468
[intruder] Oh, yeah. Look at that. Jeez!

57:53.972 --> 57:57.183
So, how long do you think it will take
for the cavalry to arrive?

57:57.266 --> 57:58.892
About ten. Fifteen, maybe.

57:58.977 --> 57:59.978
Really?

58:00.979 --> 58:04.815
I'm glad you happened across me. I could
have been out here all night, bleeding.

58:04.898 --> 58:06.525
Yeah, I'm glad I came by.

58:08.987 --> 58:09.988
In here, you said?

58:10.862 --> 58:12.531
Yeah, I think so. I'm not sure.

58:18.371 --> 58:19.830
[banging]

58:25.294 --> 58:26.294
Easy.

58:27.255 --> 58:28.255
Easy.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.217
Hey, hey, hey!

58:31.300 --> 58:33.136
Hey, come on. It is done. It is done.

58:34.053 --> 58:35.053
It is done.

58:38.016 --> 58:39.225
[John cries out]

58:47.858 --> 58:52.904
I figured I had about a two-in-ten chance
if it came to a fight.

58:55.241 --> 58:56.533
You are just so damn big.

58:58.202 --> 58:59.037
[John gasps]

58:59.120 --> 59:02.123
I'm actually pretty glad she showed up
when she did. Thank you.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.464
Shh! It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

<i>You can't outrun him on that leg.</i>

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.504
<i>- I can't outrun him on that leg.
- The crossbow has to be a perfect shot.</i>

01:01:13.588 --> 01:01:14.963
<i>In the heart or in the brain.</i>

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:16.882
<i>Anything else is not gonna cut it.</i>

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:17.799
<i>Perfect shot.</i>

01:01:17.883 --> 01:01:20.051
<i>And that's a long-distance weapon.</i>

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.304
<i>It's useless indoors.</i>

01:01:21.387 --> 01:01:24.973
<i>It's really tough up close, and you would
have to be close to land a kill shot.</i>

01:01:26.057 --> 01:01:27.185
<i>He will be moving.</i>

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.229
<i>You can't even figure out how to load it.</i>

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.565
<i>- Go outside.
- Get the power back on.</i>

01:01:32.648 --> 01:01:34.442
<i>Go outside. Get the power back on.</i>

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:36.693
<i>He could have flipped a switch
or cut the wires.</i>

01:01:38.321 --> 01:01:40.030
<i>- Hiding.
- Hiding.</i>

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.325
<i>Bedroom, bathroom, loft.</i>

01:01:42.408 --> 01:01:44.452
<i>Windows in each. All he needs is a rock.</i>

01:01:44.535 --> 01:01:45.702
<i>All he needs is a rock.</i>

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.038
<i>The loft has no cover,
no doors to barricade.</i>

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:51.166
<i>Best-case scenario, he doesn't find you
and you bleed to death.</i>

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:53.793
<i>...doesn't find me and I bleed to death.</i>

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.464
<i>- Outside.
- Head outside.</i>

01:01:56.547 --> 01:01:58.216
<i>- Crawl space.
- Go back outside.</i>

01:01:58.299 --> 01:01:59.883
<i>- Crawl space.
- The crawl space.</i>

01:01:59.966 --> 01:02:02.220
<i>- I tried that once.
- He knows you tried that.</i>

01:02:02.303 --> 01:02:05.556
<i>There is little room to manoeuvre.
If he figures out you are there...</i>

01:02:06.973 --> 01:02:08.725
<i>If he figures out I'm there...</i>

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.727
<i>I don't think you will last that long.</i>

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:15.774
<i>- I don't think I will last that long.
- You are cold, dizzy, and you're sweaty.</i>

01:02:16.567 --> 01:02:18.985
<i>Your fingernails are blue.
Your vision is fading.</i>

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:22.155
<i>We are running out of time!</i>

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.160
<i>How long before you can't even walk,
or stand up, or see?</i>

01:02:28.036 --> 01:02:30.248
<i>Sooner or later, he is coming in here.</i>

01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:31.582
<i>He knows I am bleeding out.</i>

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:33.833
<i>Once he is in this house, it is over.</i>

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.629
<i>He is bigger, stronger and faster.</i>

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:40.048
<i>And he has got the advantage.</i>

01:02:40.591 --> 01:02:41.925
<i>He has the advantage.</i>

01:02:42.008 --> 01:02:43.009
<i>He can hear you.</i>

01:02:45.471 --> 01:02:46.972
<i>I can't run.</i>

01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:48.223
<i>I can't hide.</i>

01:02:48.307 --> 01:02:49.517
<i>And we can't wait.</i>

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.060
<i>You go outside, you are dead.</i>

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:57.525
<i>Too many endings.</i>

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.569
<i>They are all the same.</i>

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.321
<i>All the same.</i>

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:06.950
<i>Which means there is only one ending
he won't expect.</i>

01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:08.494
<i>Ending...</i>

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:11.997
<i>If you can't run, hide, or wait...</i>

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:15.293
<i>...what does that leave?</i>

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.716
Kill him.

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:33.018
Yeah... I never would have won that fight.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.450
Oh, John, John, John.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.328
These things will kill you.

01:04:10.723 --> 01:04:11.890
What do you think, John?

01:04:13.392 --> 01:04:14.392
Hm?

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:18.063
Should I go in there...
and get this over with?

01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:27.029
Yeah.

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:28.824
You're probably right.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.077
I should wait a while longer...

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.121
...until she has lost more blood.

01:04:36.624 --> 01:04:38.083
I don't want to tempt a shot...

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.796
...in case her aim is any better
than her judgement.

01:04:43.672 --> 01:04:44.672

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:47.676

Hey.

01:04:58.604 --> 01:04:59.605
Is this your house?

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:03.567
Does your mommy live there?

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:05.735
Let's check.

01:05:07.863 --> 01:05:08.863
Aww!

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.535
Welcome home, puss.

01:05:14.412 --> 01:05:17.832
It's OK. You're gonna see Mommy very soon.

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:21.419
Or, at least, she will see you...

01:05:24.797 --> 01:05:25.964
...nailed to the front...
