WEBVTT

00:35.420 --> 00:38.860
- Extra! Extra! Jack the Ripper
strikes the Devil's Elbow!

00:40.040 --> 00:43.260
Extra! Extra! Jack the Ripper
strikes the Devil's Elbow!

00:45.210 --> 00:47.570
Ripper hanged today!
[bell tolling]

00:47.770 --> 00:50.310
[distant shouting]
[bell tolling]

00:54.790 --> 00:56.440
[bell tolling]

01:20.120 --> 01:21.610
Any last words?

01:21.810 --> 01:25.780
- You are gathered here today
to witness a murder.

01:27.430 --> 01:30.830
One not as gruesome
as the murder of Margaret Mehar

01:31.030 --> 01:32.870
and yet nonetheless murder.

01:34.830 --> 01:37.060
I may be guilty in the court
of public opinion,

01:37.260 --> 01:39.280
but I did not kill Margaret.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.500
And my Lord and Saviour knows
the truth.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.660
And I am blessed this day.

01:45.750 --> 01:48.230
I am blessed to return
to my maker.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.930
- That noose is made
of your words.

01:54.500 --> 01:57.730
- He killed her
and then mutilated her corpse.

01:57.930 --> 02:02.120
- And if he did not?
Then this is indeed murder,
one you'll have to atone for.

02:11.740 --> 02:14.740
[crowd cheering]

02:36.720 --> 02:38.680
Make way. Make way.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.170
[flies buzzing]
Hey!

02:53.780 --> 02:56.270
You know it's headlines
like yours that makes violence
like this happen?

02:56.470 --> 02:58.180
- If reporting the truth
creates vigilantes,

02:58.380 --> 03:00.490
then maybe there's something
wrong with the status quo.

03:00.690 --> 03:02.400
Maybe we need truth tellers
more than ever.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.230
- So you've decided
this is the work

03:04.430 --> 03:07.150
of your so-called Avenger
of the Poor, have you?

03:07.350 --> 03:09.580
- The Widow.
She's called the Widow.

03:09.780 --> 03:12.460
- Because you named her that.
- If you cared enough
about the people down here

03:12.660 --> 03:15.630
to actually talk to them,
you'd know the full story.

03:17.450 --> 03:20.860
- Well, why don't you save me
that step? What?

03:21.060 --> 03:22.730
- You'd discover
it was Eddie Jacobs

03:22.930 --> 03:24.900
who killed these two,
not the Widow.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.820
- Basil Garvey's--
- Right-hand man.

03:29.020 --> 03:32.000
Came down here
to knock a little sense
into these people.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.000
Too much by the looks of it.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.350
But you didn't hear that
from me. No.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.180
I'll blame this one on the Widow
and give the good people
of this city

03:40.380 --> 03:42.430
all the sensation
they could want.

04:10.980 --> 04:13.940
- Pardon the intrusion.
- No intrusion, my dear.

04:14.730 --> 04:18.210
- [distant whinnying]
- I was supposed to see
your show last night.

04:18.560 --> 04:20.480
I was very much looking forward
to it.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.830
- Ah, but you wanted something
a little more... personal,

04:24.030 --> 04:25.560
up close.

04:26.090 --> 04:27.310
No.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.530
My husband passed away.

04:30.310 --> 04:32.700
Oh, you poor dear. Oh...

04:34.660 --> 04:36.930
You must be Regina Simcoe.

04:37.130 --> 04:38.620
[Regina sniffling]
Ah.

04:39.450 --> 04:42.290
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Please.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.100
- [sniffling]
- Thank you.

04:49.940 --> 04:52.340
It's his death
which brings me here.

04:52.540 --> 04:56.260
I've heard that you can commune
with those who've passed
to the other side.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.870
Oh...

04:58.070 --> 05:00.430
It is a burden I've borne
since birth.

05:00.820 --> 05:03.220
- I want to speak
to my dear Alistair...

05:03.420 --> 05:05.210
to find out what happened
to him.

05:06.210 --> 05:10.610
- Yes, yes.
- To find out who killed him.
- Oh, of course, we must.

05:11.390 --> 05:13.270
I could hold a seance.

05:13.470 --> 05:14.870
Here?

05:18.400 --> 05:20.970
- Make an even stronger
connection to the other side.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.370
I would, of course,
need time alone to...

05:25.570 --> 05:27.290
spiritually cleanse the space.

05:27.490 --> 05:29.330
You understand. But...

05:29.530 --> 05:31.420
if I wasn't disturbed,

05:31.620 --> 05:35.370
oh, I could set the table
for a revelatory seance.

05:35.940 --> 05:37.910
Perhaps one evening this week.

05:38.110 --> 05:39.520
Today.

05:39.720 --> 05:42.950
Whatever the cost.
I must have answers.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.700
For my poor Alistair.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.790
Ah... of course, yes.

05:48.990 --> 05:54.310
Well... I will require a group
of spiritual believers
to bear witness.

05:54.740 --> 05:56.970
Your friends, acquaintances,

05:57.170 --> 06:01.440
people who understand
your great need and grief.

06:03.010 --> 06:05.320
I know just who to ask.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.500
Thank you, Monsieur Rondeau.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.410
- Oh.
- For helping a poor soul...

06:12.800 --> 06:15.410
[sniffling]
...destroyed by grief.

06:21.030 --> 06:24.040
- Three dollars...
from Beau Bouquet?

06:24.240 --> 06:25.950
Viv, we have nothing left.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.780
Oh. Hmm.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.350
- I don't want to make you sell
one of your jewels
or your gowns.

06:30.550 --> 06:33.740
- You wouldn't dare!
You still have that old thing.

06:34.390 --> 06:37.270
- My citrine?
- I don't expect it would fetch
very much.

06:37.470 --> 06:39.970
- It's the last gift
our mother gave me.
- Posh.

06:40.170 --> 06:42.530
- Oh, don't give me posh.
[footsteps]

06:46.100 --> 06:47.750
Good morning, dear.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.410
Good morning.

06:52.490 --> 06:55.060
I owe you a profound apology,
Viviana.

06:56.150 --> 06:58.850
You were absolutely right
about everything
you accused me of.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.210
- I behaved terribly.
- Hmm.

07:02.410 --> 07:05.040
- I got swept up
in the excitement
of our being reunited.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.210
And this... big,
exciting night out.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.340
And the attention I got
as your sister.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.310
It's all so new to me and...

07:14.510 --> 07:16.080
I behaved shamefully.

07:16.690 --> 07:19.130
I should've been demure
and ladylike.

07:20.090 --> 07:23.090
Instead, I betrayed
both of your faith in me.

07:26.620 --> 07:30.850
- I can see
that our session last night
has helped you learn contrition.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.450
- Wholeheartedly, sister,
and I thank you for it.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.500
- Think of me
as your spiritual North Star.

07:43.110 --> 07:46.770
- I hope you will someday
forgive me my transgressions.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.210
In good time perhaps.

07:49.410 --> 07:51.340
- [gasping]
- My goodness.

07:51.540 --> 07:53.260
What is it?

07:53.460 --> 07:57.920
- Regina Simcoe, poor creature,
she has invited us to a seance
today...

07:58.120 --> 08:01.400
with the very great,
very handsome Georges Rondeau.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.140
- Oh, what fun!
I have many questions
for the spirits.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.360
- As have I.
- But w-w-would that not be
risking our souls,

08:08.560 --> 08:10.020
communing with the shadow realm?

08:10.210 --> 08:11.930
- Oh, you have nothing
to worry about,

08:12.130 --> 08:14.540
because you will be
accompanying us
to our dear friend's gathering.

08:14.740 --> 08:16.360
Nor you, dear sister.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.760
Pardon?

08:18.960 --> 08:21.640
- The coal delivery arrives
today and someone must be here
to receive it.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.640
It can't possibly be me.
The only thing I know about coal
is that it turns into diamonds.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.210
- But--
- I-I could receive
these workmen.

08:29.410 --> 08:31.340
- Oh, I'm certain
you would love to,
but no, no, no.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.520
We cannot leave you alone
with any men.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.820
Besides, you will be too busy
doing all the other chores
we've lined up for you.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.700
- Certainly you didn't expect
to be expunged of all your guilt
quite so easily?

08:40.900 --> 08:42.730
Foolish girl.
[laughter]

08:43.690 --> 08:46.560
Clearly you get your brains
from your mother.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.840
I know you killed those two.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.440
Funny...

08:57.010 --> 08:59.500
I heard the pretty one fell
and cracked her skull.

08:59.700 --> 09:03.230
Tragic accident.
Nothing to lose your head over.

09:04.450 --> 09:07.120
- Detective,
you've had a busy morning.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.280
Word, please.

09:17.550 --> 09:20.000
- You know who that is?
- Yeah, and so do
five other witnesses

09:20.200 --> 09:23.830
who say they saw him
and multiple other men
walk into that alleyway

09:24.030 --> 09:26.440
where Horatio Dixon
and Daisy Zywiecki
were murdered.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.310
- And these witnesses,
were they all in the trade?

09:29.510 --> 09:31.620
- Yes, sir,
but that doesn't discount
what they saw.

09:31.820 --> 09:34.450
- Maybe they were playing.
I wouldn't put it past
one of the other pimps

09:34.650 --> 09:36.440
to knock out the competition.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.790
[Rijkers sighing]
Eddie.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.670
I got a problem here.

09:41.870 --> 09:44.540
I'm hearing
two very conflicting stories.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.500
- One that makes sense
and one that don't.

09:47.700 --> 09:49.850
My boss would never shit
where he eats, so...

09:50.050 --> 09:53.160
why would he send me and my boys
all the way to the Elbow
to kill anyone?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.200
Especially since
we're all the way in Hamilton.

09:59.550 --> 10:00.680
Well...

10:02.070 --> 10:04.220
until we gather
more evidence--

10:04.420 --> 10:07.830
- Sir, what? You're just gonna
take him at his word?
- Till we gather more evidence,

10:08.030 --> 10:09.650
you are free to go.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.570
I hope you catch your guy.

10:24.440 --> 10:25.710
Eddie!

10:26.750 --> 10:28.890
Get it through Basil's
thick fuckin' skull:

10:29.090 --> 10:30.550
He is not untouchable.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.160
This war ends now.

10:32.360 --> 10:34.030
We just stopped it.

10:34.230 --> 10:38.080
- By relieving Horatio Dixon
of his head?
This is not the Middle Ages!

10:38.280 --> 10:40.170
- We went down there
to scare people,

10:40.360 --> 10:41.910
not kill anyone.

10:42.110 --> 10:44.910
- The harlot.
- It was an accident, I swear.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.960
And when we left,
Horatio's head
was still on his shoulders.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.860
It wasn't us.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.210
It was her.

10:56.520 --> 10:57.830
Jesus.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.020
Hmm.

11:04.210 --> 11:07.060
- I can't help but wonder
about the relief and solace
you might find

11:07.260 --> 11:11.500
if you came to my church
rather than your regular visits
to your favourite temple of sin.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.420
- Back the fuck off, Padre,
or instead of some
grateful whore,

11:14.620 --> 11:16.420
I'll take my aggression out
on you.

11:16.620 --> 11:19.550
- Just hearkening you to God.
- Oh, fuck your God,

11:19.750 --> 11:22.630
his promise of a heaven
when it's all over.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.300
Where did that devotion
get your father,

11:25.500 --> 11:27.860
other than at the end
of a swinging rope?

11:28.810 --> 11:31.130
- You can blow and bluster
all you want,

11:31.330 --> 11:34.220
but even you answer to God,
for all your sins,
past and present.

11:34.420 --> 11:37.690
And if you will not repent,
the devil may send the Widow
for you.

11:38.390 --> 11:40.740
Find goodness, find purity.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.610
For the Widow will show you
no mercy.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.410
- I'll have another edition
ready in half an hour.
- The hell you will.

11:55.610 --> 11:57.580
Kill the fuckin' Widow story.

11:58.100 --> 12:01.120
- We're on our third edition.
We're printing money!
- Kill it,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.160
or find yourself another job.

12:03.360 --> 12:06.200
- We haven't sold a day's paper
like this in--
- Twelve years. I know.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.470
Kill it. Burn everything
yourselves already printed,

12:11.670 --> 12:14.380
kill the story now and forever.

12:15.470 --> 12:18.660
You made the Widow,
now I'm burying her.

12:18.850 --> 12:21.950
- If we kill it,
the real story's gonna get out.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.620
What story is that?

12:31.820 --> 12:35.670
- Town philanthropist
Basil Garvey
directs his henchmen--

12:35.870 --> 12:36.840
[gasping]

12:38.100 --> 12:40.070
When are you gonna realize

12:40.270 --> 12:43.540
that you don't exist
without my say-so?

12:44.850 --> 12:46.330
[crying out]

12:47.240 --> 12:48.640
[screaming]

12:48.840 --> 12:51.430
You owe everything to me!
[gasping]

12:51.630 --> 12:53.560
I am the truth around here!

12:53.760 --> 12:55.900
[crying out]
[coughing]

12:57.860 --> 13:01.310
I am life and I am death!

13:01.510 --> 13:03.180
And you!
[crying out]

13:03.380 --> 13:07.170
You are just a maggot
who does my bidding,
or have you forgotten?!

13:07.560 --> 13:09.010
[gasping]

13:09.210 --> 13:11.750
Every single word you print,

13:11.950 --> 13:15.360
an ad for the fucking
church bazaar,

13:15.560 --> 13:18.710
it all has to get approved
by me.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.070
- Uh, I'll deal
with the pimp murder.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.850
You're pulling me.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.910
Sir, I'm not afraid
of Basil Garvey.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.730
You should be.

13:40.550 --> 13:43.600
This is a powder keg
of local politics
and power struggles.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.780
It's best handled
by someone with experience.
And connections.

13:47.820 --> 13:50.400
- Connections.
- I'm fuckin' protecting you,
Detective.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.100
The world out there
is not just black and white.
- Sir, they're killers.

13:55.300 --> 13:58.100
- That may be,
but if it is them,
they're the killers we know.

13:58.300 --> 14:02.800
What worries me
is the killers we don't know.
Out there, circling,

14:03.000 --> 14:05.750
striking when she wants.
That's what's scaring the city.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.630
Well, did make a breakthrough.

14:11.240 --> 14:12.720
Hallelujah.

14:14.410 --> 14:17.330
- I found this
in Alistair Simcoe's desk
in his home office.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.940
Margaret Mehar?

14:21.590 --> 14:23.820
- But he's just a murder nut.
You know, lots of people are.

14:24.020 --> 14:26.430
- No. I would've thought
that too, sir, but...

14:26.630 --> 14:30.440
the note - "Friends of Margaret
are my target" -

14:30.640 --> 14:32.660
it must be referencing
the same woman.

14:32.860 --> 14:34.570
- I arrested the sick fuck
that killed her.

14:34.770 --> 14:36.660
- Sir, what if you got
the wrong guy?

14:36.860 --> 14:40.190
What if Alistair Simcoe
is somehow connected
to her murder?

14:40.390 --> 14:41.790
Sir!

14:48.490 --> 14:50.100
[scoffing]

14:52.230 --> 14:54.640
- If you're here to try
to connect me to the attack,
you'll be out on your ass.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.990
I cared about those people.

14:57.190 --> 15:00.330
- I know. You and I both know
who ordered their murders.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.460
Basil has you, me,
and this entire city
under his boot.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.300
But it doesn't have to stay
that way.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.310
- Oh, really?
You got an army full of goons
ready to do your bidding?

15:11.510 --> 15:13.000
'Cause I sure as fuck don't.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.910
- No, but you must have
some dirt.

15:15.870 --> 15:19.710
And me...
I have a printing press.
[Crenshaw scoffing]

15:19.900 --> 15:22.350
- I don't think you appreciate
who you're dealing with.

15:23.270 --> 15:24.840
- That's why it would have
to be bad.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.500
- Oh, it would be bad...
for both of us.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.270
You stay anonymous.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.070
- Anything I know about Basil
he knows I know.

15:32.270 --> 15:36.370
And thank you very much,
but I don't wanna join
Horatio Dixon in the morgue.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.500
I'm a smart man.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.670
Answer will always be no.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.900
Unlike Terrence...

15:51.380 --> 15:53.030
I never say no.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.440
Did you know him, Detective?

16:08.310 --> 16:10.010
We crossed paths.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.500
- Is there something amiss?
- Not amiss per se.

16:15.700 --> 16:17.110
Uh, may I?

16:17.310 --> 16:18.930
By all means.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.000
No...

16:41.200 --> 16:43.220
not amiss, but special.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.400
- In what way?
- Daisy died by misadventure,
but this,

16:47.600 --> 16:49.830
this is clearly
premeditated murder.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.310
So the Widow...

16:52.830 --> 16:54.490
...has struck again.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.370
- Did you find any note
hidden in the body?

16:57.570 --> 17:01.370
- Would I not have told you
if I had?
But you're free to look.

17:01.570 --> 17:04.980
- I'm looking.
- And what do you see?

17:05.800 --> 17:09.200
- Bruising here shows us
the first strike.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.340
Cracking in the spine
confirms that.

17:12.540 --> 17:14.850
Agreed. A knife blade.

17:16.510 --> 17:19.130
Lacerations here and here,

17:19.330 --> 17:21.730
they show us a clear path
of the cutting.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.870
Right to left.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.610
That's helpful.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.920
How so?

17:37.920 --> 17:40.180
Right to left.

17:42.190 --> 17:43.880
Right to left.

17:46.450 --> 17:48.410
The Widow's lefthanded.

17:53.460 --> 17:55.690
Ah, welcome, my dear.

17:55.890 --> 17:57.460
- Mm.
- Oh.

17:58.640 --> 18:00.860
Don't you look ravishing.

18:01.550 --> 18:03.610
I had hoped to see
your beautiful sister.

18:03.810 --> 18:06.350
- She is devastated
that she cannot be here.
- Mm.

18:06.550 --> 18:09.310
- You rogue, Monsieur Rondeau.
[laughter]

18:09.510 --> 18:11.090
Georges, please.

18:15.920 --> 18:17.790
There's the poor dear.

18:18.350 --> 18:22.840
- Thank you so much for coming.
- I am here for you
in any way you need.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.970
How are you holding up?

18:25.880 --> 18:29.150
- I haven't been sleeping.
I'm desperate for answers.

18:29.840 --> 18:34.110
- She's done the wise thing
and turned to the other side
for help.

18:34.590 --> 18:35.940
[sighing]

18:37.420 --> 18:40.210
I've done this many times
before. In fact,

18:40.410 --> 18:42.340
a most learned shah once told me

18:42.540 --> 18:46.470
he had never witnessed
a more direct contact
with the dead than mine.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.040
If you will join Shanika and I
in clasping hands.

18:54.390 --> 18:58.320
I must demand total obedience
if you are to remain safe.

18:58.510 --> 19:00.750
If you're to stay on the side
of the living,

19:00.950 --> 19:05.700
you must trust your care
entirely to me.

19:14.150 --> 19:17.330
- I'm glad someone understands
that as long as Basil Garvey
is in charge,

19:17.530 --> 19:19.760
we are beholden entirely to him.

19:20.550 --> 19:24.770
- The days of Basil Garvey
and Alistair Simcoe are over.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.130
What's that?

19:27.330 --> 19:30.170
- Print these and prepare
to be shocked...

19:30.370 --> 19:32.040
or turned on.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.740
If you are a size queen,
you definitely
won't be disappointed.

19:35.940 --> 19:37.880
- Do I look
like an anything "queen"?

19:38.080 --> 19:40.520
Appearances can be deceiving.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.450
But our dear Basil

19:42.650 --> 19:46.800
is most definitely flagranting
his delicto

19:47.000 --> 19:49.150
with a most domineering
dominatrix

19:49.350 --> 19:50.920
in these photos.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.460
And I assure you...

19:54.660 --> 19:58.930
he will do anything
to keep these from getting out.

20:00.410 --> 20:02.020
Thank you.

20:04.630 --> 20:06.160
Uh...

20:07.980 --> 20:10.950
You didn't think
this was a charitable donation
on my part, did you?

20:11.150 --> 20:14.740
- Oh, I thought you were
invested in the greater good.
- I am.

20:14.940 --> 20:18.480
But I'm even more interested
in a brand-new wig.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.170
I'm thinking blond
sausage curls?

20:31.140 --> 20:33.110
<i>The spirit realm is nebulous.</i>

20:33.310 --> 20:36.720
A hazy line separates
our material world,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.200
and in order to draw
a spirit over,

20:39.400 --> 20:41.590
requires a lure, something...

20:41.790 --> 20:43.410
valuable, something...

20:44.720 --> 20:46.330
...unique.

20:47.890 --> 20:49.730
- Oh.
[chuckling]

20:49.930 --> 20:52.200
That was a gift from my <i>maman.</i>

20:53.510 --> 20:56.820
- Perfect. And has she passed
to the other side?

20:57.020 --> 20:58.770
- Tragically, yes.
- Ah.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.530
Is there anything
you'd like to ask her?

21:01.720 --> 21:04.350
- Yes. Yes!
Ask dear <i>maman...</i>

21:04.550 --> 21:07.230
if she thinks
Basil Garvey and I...

21:07.430 --> 21:09.920
will have a happy union.
[chuckling]

21:10.120 --> 21:13.190
- A perfect yes-or-no question
to warm up the table.
[laughing]

21:13.390 --> 21:17.190
If it tilts to the right,
it means yes; to the left, no.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.020
Now, everyone...

21:19.220 --> 21:21.240
focus.
[sighing]

21:21.440 --> 21:23.630
And open your minds...

21:23.830 --> 21:25.710
to the cosmos.

21:31.890 --> 21:35.430
Oh...
mother of Viviana Botticelli,

21:35.630 --> 21:39.390
we ask you to grace us
with your spiritual presence

21:39.590 --> 21:44.610
to answer a question
about the most holy of emotions,

21:44.810 --> 21:46.440
love.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.490
Will thine own daughter
find love everlasting
with Basil Garvey,

21:51.690 --> 21:53.310
her betrothed?

22:02.270 --> 22:06.190
I beseech thee.
Come to us from the other side.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.200
Will she find happiness,

22:09.400 --> 22:11.030
O wise mother?

22:11.230 --> 22:12.810
[creaking]

22:13.010 --> 22:15.160
- [gasping]
- Oh, my.
[laughing]

22:15.360 --> 22:17.430
That means yes, right?
She said yes?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.300
- She said yes.
[Viviana exclaiming]

22:19.500 --> 22:21.000
Happy day!
[laughing]

22:21.200 --> 22:24.220
- Ahem. As overjoyed as I am
for my dear friend,

22:24.420 --> 22:26.310
we are not here
to divine the future.

22:26.510 --> 22:28.700
We're here to find answers
for the painful past.

22:28.900 --> 22:30.570
Of course, my dear.

22:30.770 --> 22:33.350
We forget ourselves.
[sighing]

22:33.740 --> 22:36.270
Thank you, O generous mother.

22:36.470 --> 22:38.970
You may return now
to the other side.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.310
[rumbling]
[Viviana exclaiming]

22:42.180 --> 22:44.450
[laughing]
Did you feel that?

22:44.650 --> 22:46.530
That was <i>maman</i>saying goodbye.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.330
Goodbye.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.200
Now, on to the job at hand.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.190
These were worn
by your dear departed husband,
correct?

22:55.370 --> 22:57.990
- For reading... yes.
- Ah...

22:58.190 --> 23:00.170
to see...

23:00.360 --> 23:02.300
And now I shall drop the veil,

23:02.500 --> 23:05.650
so that we can see
what truly happened

23:05.850 --> 23:07.430
to your loving husband.

23:07.630 --> 23:09.440
Ladies...

23:09.640 --> 23:12.610
what the great Georges Rondeau
is about to do
is far more serious,

23:12.810 --> 23:17.100
and dangerous,
so absolute focus and quiet.

23:17.290 --> 23:18.960
- Mm-hmm.

23:23.050 --> 23:25.280
Spirit world...

23:25.480 --> 23:28.410
I call forth Alistair Simcoe

23:28.610 --> 23:31.010
to speak with us this night.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.850
I call forth Alistair Simcoe

23:35.050 --> 23:37.200
to give his loving wife,

23:37.400 --> 23:39.380
Regina Simcoe,

23:39.580 --> 23:43.430
peace with the answers
she seeks.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.080
Please, Alistair,

23:46.280 --> 23:47.690
tell us:

23:47.890 --> 23:52.510
Do you know what vile person
murdered you?

23:56.690 --> 23:58.560
[screaming]

23:59.220 --> 24:02.050
- [exclamations]
- Oh, heavens!
Regina, are you alright?

24:02.250 --> 24:05.830
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm shaken, but I'm fine.

24:07.180 --> 24:09.230
- [laughing]
- Ooh.

24:10.270 --> 24:11.620
[Regina]: Oh!

24:23.200 --> 24:25.240
[creaking and rattling]

24:42.780 --> 24:45.650
- Enid, you're starting
to believe your own headlines.

25:03.850 --> 25:07.380
"Tattle Tails
a Woman's Wails
A paper's lies for sooth

25:07.580 --> 25:11.510
A living hell,
if you don't tell
your evil buried truth"

25:19.340 --> 25:21.300
[dissonant music]

25:26.520 --> 25:28.230
- I'd say
that got their attention.

25:28.430 --> 25:30.490
It always does.

25:30.690 --> 25:33.230
Though Miss Simcoe
may charge you for the table.

25:33.430 --> 25:37.060
- We can't be held responsible
for the whims of the spirits.

25:37.260 --> 25:40.140
And even if we did,
we'd still come out ahead.

25:40.710 --> 25:44.160
Oh... very far ahead.

25:44.350 --> 25:45.890
[chuckling]

25:47.630 --> 25:49.290
<i>Mesdames...</i>

25:49.490 --> 25:51.680
the spirits made contact

25:51.880 --> 25:53.770
and they have something
important to say.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.520
- Was it really my husband
you communed with?
[sighing]

25:56.720 --> 25:58.780
- There is a ripple
in the ether,

25:58.980 --> 26:01.350
a disturbance
in the "ectenic psychode".

26:01.550 --> 26:03.740
Can any of you feel it?

26:03.940 --> 26:05.560
The spirits are restless.

26:07.470 --> 26:10.050
They get this way
when a great injustice
has violated the physical plane.

26:10.250 --> 26:15.010
So I must wrestle
our spiritual advisor
into submission and allow him,

26:15.210 --> 26:16.620
or her,

26:16.820 --> 26:19.360
despite Shanika begging me
otherwise,

26:19.560 --> 26:21.110
to inhabit me.

26:21.300 --> 26:24.020
- [gasping]
- Are you talking... possession?

26:24.220 --> 26:26.720
I'm talking... <i>inwatso!</i>

26:26.920 --> 26:31.590
A secret calling I learned
from the Xesibe tribes
of South Africa.

26:31.790 --> 26:34.990
- Is it dangerous?
- Thrice banned
on this continent.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.560
But everything worth doing is...

26:37.760 --> 26:39.780
dangerous, my dear.

26:39.980 --> 26:44.390
- Oh, really, Georges,
is that wise?
- Yes, listen to her!

26:44.590 --> 26:46.390
The last time you performed
the <i>inwatso,</i>

26:46.590 --> 26:49.180
you were committed to an asylum
for the insane.

26:49.380 --> 26:51.270
All of this is true,

26:51.470 --> 26:54.700
but a murder was committed
and I pledged my dear hostess

26:54.900 --> 26:59.490
that I would do
whatever it takes in my means
to find an answer.

26:59.690 --> 27:01.840
So I must hazard it.

27:02.040 --> 27:04.450
Now, please, good ladies,
I need your help.

27:04.650 --> 27:07.460
We'll all sit in a circle,
join hands,

27:07.660 --> 27:09.850
and with the help of <i>inwatso,</i>

27:10.050 --> 27:13.580
I shall be your vessel
of the truth.

27:19.720 --> 27:22.460
[exhaling and inhaling]

27:23.420 --> 27:25.420
[breathing deeply]

27:33.780 --> 27:35.690
<i>Imimoya...</i>

27:36.740 --> 27:39.230
<i>...wozani kimi.</i>

27:39.430 --> 27:44.310
<i>Vula umnyango phakathi</i>
<i>kwemihlaba yethu.</i>

27:45.090 --> 27:47.050
<i>Woza...</i>

27:47.920 --> 27:50.190
<i>...ungisebenzise...</i>

27:50.530 --> 27:53.010
<i>...njengesitsha sakho..</i>

27:54.150 --> 27:56.540
<i>...futhi ungidle.</i>

28:00.670 --> 28:02.110
[rattling]

28:12.770 --> 28:15.650
- [exclaiming]
- We must stop! We're in danger!

28:15.850 --> 28:19.210
- Georges, what is happening?!
Stop this now! We beg you!

28:30.440 --> 28:32.240
I am here...

28:32.440 --> 28:35.190
- [gasping]
- Dear Lord, protect us.

28:36.100 --> 28:37.550
[groaning]
[gasping]

28:37.750 --> 28:39.720
[groaning]

28:39.920 --> 28:42.120
He did not protect me.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.150
Yeah.
Why should he protect you...

28:45.630 --> 28:47.810
or anyone?

28:48.720 --> 28:50.990
[Georges]: Who are you, spirit?

28:51.190 --> 28:52.780
Do you have a name?

28:52.980 --> 28:54.430
[raspy breathing]

28:54.630 --> 28:56.950
I am Alistair Simcoe.

28:59.650 --> 29:02.820
Or... I was.
[raspy breathing]

29:03.820 --> 29:06.490
But I was murdered.
[groaning]

29:06.690 --> 29:08.050
Murdered!

29:08.250 --> 29:10.800
And my executioner
still walks free!

29:11.000 --> 29:13.410
- [raspy breathing]
- Do you know who killed you?

29:13.610 --> 29:15.310
[gasping]

29:16.840 --> 29:18.720
She hides...

29:18.920 --> 29:21.070
behind a widow's veil.

29:21.270 --> 29:24.110
[raspy breathing]
Lurking.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.990
Waiting until
she can strike again.
[gasping]

29:29.190 --> 29:30.730
And again!

29:30.930 --> 29:32.730
Twice the bell has tolled!

29:32.930 --> 29:34.690
Six times more it will,

29:34.890 --> 29:37.390
and only then
will Margaret be avenged!

29:37.590 --> 29:39.730
[gasping]

29:42.510 --> 29:44.470
[cracking]

29:47.390 --> 29:49.350
[screaming]

29:53.790 --> 29:58.440
[Viviana]: Unbelievable. Look.
Regina? She's moving.
Is it her? Is she with us?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.060
Regina, dear?

30:01.260 --> 30:02.760
She's coming back to us.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.810
- But i-is it her?
Is it dear Regina?

30:06.010 --> 30:09.160
- Speak, child.
Is it you, Regina Simcoe,

30:09.360 --> 30:12.080
or does a spirit still reside
within you?

30:12.270 --> 30:14.730
[Regina]: What?
Of course, it's me.

30:14.930 --> 30:18.120
- [relieved sighs]
- Take it easy, slowly.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.940
- Let me help you there.
[panting]

30:23.160 --> 30:24.650
What happened?

30:24.850 --> 30:26.480
You happened, my dear.

30:26.680 --> 30:29.310
The spirit of your dear,
departed husband...

30:29.510 --> 30:31.870
chose to manifest himself
through you.

30:33.440 --> 30:35.930
- I channelled Alistair?
- You did.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.140
I've never seen
such a clear manifestation.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.800
Nor I.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.180
- Have you had any psychic
episodes in your past?

30:46.100 --> 30:47.750
I was born with a caul.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.680
- As was I.
- What's a caul?

30:51.880 --> 30:57.080
- Something which some people
do not wish to speak about
in polite company.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.200
- And yet, a certain sign
of psychic prowess.

31:02.030 --> 31:03.420
I have had...

31:04.290 --> 31:06.690
I guess you could call them...

31:06.890 --> 31:09.340
feelings... about things.

31:10.730 --> 31:12.430
The night Alistair...

31:16.650 --> 31:18.090
I begged him.

31:19.440 --> 31:21.220
I begged him not to go.

31:22.660 --> 31:26.490
But he said he had work to do
and he couldn't be swayed.

31:30.410 --> 31:31.890
I'm an abomination.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.680
No, my dear Regina.

31:34.880 --> 31:37.860
You are what I've long been
looking for,

31:38.060 --> 31:39.720
the rarest of finds.

31:42.070 --> 31:43.900
A revelation.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.820
<i>"Tattle Tails,</i>

31:48.020 --> 31:49.390
a Woman's Wails

31:49.590 --> 31:51.700
A paper's lies for sooth

31:51.900 --> 31:55.650
A living hell,
if you don't tell
your evil buried truth."

31:56.430 --> 31:58.170
What lies did you tell?

31:58.650 --> 32:02.190
Who is the Widow referencing
when she writes,
"A woman's wails"?

32:02.380 --> 32:04.970
- You're asking me to decipher
the ramblings of a madwoman.

32:05.170 --> 32:07.490
- Yes.
It's exactly what I'm doing.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.970
- Sorry, Detective, but I can't.
Haven't the first clue
what that letter means.

32:12.620 --> 32:14.150
It's pretty simple.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.980
You published lies
about someone,

32:17.180 --> 32:19.810
and now the Widow wants you
to publish the truth.
Otherwise--

32:20.010 --> 32:22.730
Otherwise... Exactly.

32:22.930 --> 32:26.510
Do you honestly believe this is
the first threat I've received
for revealing the truth?

32:26.710 --> 32:28.340
It's part of my job, Detective.

32:28.540 --> 32:32.350
I'll deal with this threat
the same way I deal
with all the rest.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.910
I'll thank the person
for reading...

32:35.110 --> 32:36.990
and then I'll burn that letter.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.740
No, you won't.

32:39.940 --> 32:41.520
Hey, that's mine.

32:41.870 --> 32:43.360
It was left for me.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.750
- It's also evidence
in a murder investigation.

32:45.950 --> 32:47.740
Two, in fact.

32:48.790 --> 32:50.180
Two?

32:50.750 --> 32:53.530
Alistair Simcoe, obviously.

32:54.270 --> 32:56.850
I suspect Horatio Dixon,
as well.

32:57.050 --> 33:00.160
- Nah, Horatio was killed
by the hands
of Basil Garvey's thugs.

33:00.360 --> 33:01.900
Mm, not necessarily.

33:02.100 --> 33:04.810
If he is the second
in a string of murders,

33:05.010 --> 33:07.110
you need to take this threat
seriously.

33:08.420 --> 33:11.080
If you know something, anything,
pertaining to the Widow,

33:11.280 --> 33:14.160
now is the time to tell me,
for your own safety.

33:16.900 --> 33:20.570
Enid, please, I know we've had
our differences, but these are
not just random murders.

33:20.770 --> 33:23.260
They connect back to the murder
of Margaret Mehar.

33:26.610 --> 33:28.350
That was 12 years ago.

33:30.700 --> 33:33.140
- Lust for vengeance
doesn't expire.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.490
Maybe it's you, Detective.

33:39.660 --> 33:41.190
I'm sorry?

33:42.020 --> 33:44.940
- You come in here,
you interpret the Widow's note,

33:45.140 --> 33:47.510
you steer me toward a murder
I haven't thought of
in over a decade,

33:47.710 --> 33:50.630
one that the police
failed to solve, but I did,
this paper did.

33:52.420 --> 33:54.160
Perhaps you're the Widow...

33:55.200 --> 33:58.990
jealous of my skill
and seeking vengeance
for your own failures.

33:59.950 --> 34:01.600
Be careful, Enid.

34:02.950 --> 34:04.300
Please.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.710
Oh. Your sisters drink swill.

34:27.190 --> 34:31.850
I'll send you a case
of my favourite single malt;
only the best for you.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.950
- I don't imbibe.
- I do.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.770
Too much.

34:36.970 --> 34:41.730
I'm sure
you would cure me of that,
among so many other bad habits.

34:42.510 --> 34:45.650
- Mr. Garvey, Venetia has gone
to meet Viviana
at Mrs. Simcoe's manse.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.310
Perhaps if you were to head--

34:47.510 --> 34:49.050
I know what I want.

34:49.250 --> 34:51.430
[exhaling]
Always have.

34:52.430 --> 34:54.090
Always do.

34:54.780 --> 34:57.090
But what do you want, my dear?

34:58.830 --> 35:01.710
To live here in this empty shell
of a house,

35:01.910 --> 35:06.010
scrubbing your sisters' floors
while they enjoy themselves
among society?

35:06.840 --> 35:09.590
Do you not deserve
so much more than that?

35:09.790 --> 35:11.930
I can give you the world.

35:13.320 --> 35:17.370
Anything you desire.
The life you so richly deserve.

35:18.110 --> 35:21.780
And while I know
I love you already,

35:21.980 --> 35:24.430
I understand
it might take you some time.

35:24.630 --> 35:27.520
- You're betrothed to my sister.
- No.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.350
No, uh, we're close, it's true.

35:30.550 --> 35:34.560
She and Venetia are angling
for something I never promised.

35:34.910 --> 35:37.780
Viviana has no engagement ring.

35:38.390 --> 35:40.970
All I really owe her
is a little common courtesy.

35:41.170 --> 35:44.360
So I'll wait
an appropriate amount of time

35:44.560 --> 35:47.100
before you and I announce
our engagement.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.590
No. This is...

35:50.790 --> 35:52.680
[door opening]
[laughter]

35:52.880 --> 35:56.280
- Verdi, why is this bucket
in the middle of the foyer
for us to stumble over?

35:57.150 --> 35:59.330
- Because she's lazy, sister,
that's why.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.720
Mr. Garvey.

36:02.420 --> 36:04.470
To what do we owe
this pleasure?

36:04.670 --> 36:06.330
At so late an hour?

36:07.420 --> 36:09.210
I was just leaving.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.640
Good night, ladies.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.560
Good night, Verdi.

36:29.090 --> 36:30.620
Harlot.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.940
- He came here unannounced,
but I begged him to go!
Please, sister, believe me!

36:35.140 --> 36:37.900
- Sister? Is this how sisters
treat each other?

36:38.090 --> 36:40.250
By stabbing each other
in the back?

36:40.450 --> 36:43.730
- No, please!
I'm not knowingly doing anything
to encourage... Ah!

36:43.930 --> 36:47.250
- If it's subconscious,
I will whip it out of you!
- No, please! Let me go! Ah!

36:47.450 --> 36:49.340
- We're just trying to help you,
sister!

36:49.540 --> 36:52.160
[sobbing]
[screaming]

36:59.860 --> 37:03.220
- Keep staring like that,
your eyes will pop out.
- Sir.

37:08.220 --> 37:09.750
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

37:09.950 --> 37:12.270
- You're chewing your nails.
- The handwriting, sir.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.500
Yeah, it's the same. Kid...

37:16.700 --> 37:19.850
if this is as good as you got,
maybe I was wrong about you.

37:20.050 --> 37:24.460
- Sir, whoever wrote these notes
used their left hand.
You can tell by the slant.

37:24.660 --> 37:28.420
- Okay, pick up the pace.
Your flair for the dramatic
is killing me.

37:28.620 --> 37:32.300
- Horatio, the pimp,
he was decapitated
by someone who was lefthanded.

37:32.500 --> 37:36.390
The parchment? They're the same.
They're most likely cut
from the same source.

37:36.590 --> 37:39.220
And then the ink looks to be
some form of iron tannate,

37:39.420 --> 37:42.440
which is far more expensive
than the much more common
aniline dyes that most...

37:42.640 --> 37:46.530
- Okay, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
enough of the grandstanding.
We need actual clues.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.840
- These are clues, sir.
- You're going to arrest every
lefthanded citizen in the city?

37:50.040 --> 37:52.670
And anyone who owns
this fancy ink? Go ahead.

37:52.870 --> 37:55.100
Build a thousand jails
while you're at it.

37:55.300 --> 37:59.670
- Sir, all of this is giving me
a profile on who our killer is.

37:59.870 --> 38:02.720
Someone lefthanded, yes,
but also someone educated,

38:02.920 --> 38:05.810
someone rich enough
to write in expensive ink.

38:06.010 --> 38:10.410
- Well, go out onto the streets
and find him.
- Her.

38:12.370 --> 38:14.030
Oh, you hear that, boys?

38:14.230 --> 38:17.290
Detective Kenny here
has a big new lead.

38:17.990 --> 38:21.430
Our Widow is a fancy lady
who likes to write poetry
with her left hand

38:21.630 --> 38:25.430
when she's not using it
to chop people up
into stewing beef.

38:28.130 --> 38:29.650
Case solved.

38:46.410 --> 38:48.360
- Gold.
[banging]

38:49.970 --> 38:51.420
[banging]

38:51.620 --> 38:53.330
[footsteps]

38:57.420 --> 38:59.030

39:18.480 --> 39:20.700

[gasping]

39:22.440 --> 39:23.920
[creaking]

39:44.460 --> 39:46.120
[banging]

40:17.150 --> 40:19.190
[dissonant music]

40:46.660 --> 40:48.490
Jesus Christ Almighty.

40:48.690 --> 40:50.010
Wh...

40:50.530 --> 40:52.140
what do you want?

40:57.670 --> 41:00.800
Please just t-take it.
Take whatever you'd like.

41:12.290 --> 41:14.520
You asked me to print the truth.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.770
Well, this is the truth.

41:17.510 --> 41:19.520
Basil Garvey is...

41:19.720 --> 41:23.050
a miscreant,
a vile, controlling criminal,

41:23.250 --> 41:25.270
a perverter of the truth!

41:25.470 --> 41:29.610
That's the story we should tell!
I-it's the story that will work,
that will destroy him!

41:32.180 --> 41:36.020
I'm the editor!
I know what should and shouldn't
go into my paper!

41:36.220 --> 41:38.720
Not anyone else!
Not Basil, not you!

41:38.920 --> 41:40.360
Just me!

41:42.500 --> 41:45.420
[Garvey]: You're not the voice
of the people, idiot.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.240
You're my voice.
You write what I tell you
to fucking write.

41:50.200 --> 41:51.850
Then I quit!

41:55.990 --> 41:58.950
One day you'll see
you signed a deal
with the devil.

42:05.130 --> 42:07.780
- It should've been
that exciting in your bylines.

42:08.650 --> 42:10.040
Asshole.

42:13.570 --> 42:14.740
You.

42:15.750 --> 42:18.490
You're a woman.
Under the threads, I mean.

42:19.530 --> 42:20.750
Your point?

42:21.880 --> 42:23.620
A female editor.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.370
Now, that's forward thinking;

42:26.570 --> 42:28.770
shows someone not stuck
in their ways.

42:28.970 --> 42:31.640
Not me as a publisher,
not you as an editor.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.850
Editor? Huh.

42:34.810 --> 42:36.600
You want me to be an editor?

42:36.800 --> 42:40.040
- You're not up for the job?
- No, sir, I'm...
very much up for the job.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.120
Good. You better be.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.740
'Cause I need someone
in that office

42:44.940 --> 42:47.000
who's gonna make sure
the Echo Tribune reflects

42:47.200 --> 42:49.400
the ethos of its publisher,

42:49.600 --> 42:51.920
like how you went
after Andrew May
for the Ripper killing.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.010
- It was your lead, sir.
I just followed the evidence.

42:55.210 --> 42:56.870
- Yes.
And you didn't question it.

42:57.610 --> 43:00.580
That story sold more papers
than we ever have.

43:00.780 --> 43:03.110
And a guilty man
was brought to justice.

43:03.310 --> 43:04.750
Right?

43:05.360 --> 43:07.320
- Right.
- Good.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.680
I look forward to working
with you...

43:09.880 --> 43:12.680
Enid Jenkins. You get me.

43:12.880 --> 43:16.590
And for someone in my position,
that's more valuable than gold.

43:25.030 --> 43:28.440
- I didn't do anything!
I can't undo what's been done!

43:28.640 --> 43:30.340
No!
[screaming]

43:33.000 --> 43:34.960
I'm not a killer!

43:35.160 --> 43:38.360
Ah! It was Basil!
He was behind it all!

43:38.560 --> 43:42.100
But I couldn't print that!
He would never let me! Please!

43:42.300 --> 43:45.580
All I did was make up a story
a long time ago

43:45.780 --> 43:48.140
and take some photos!

43:49.450 --> 43:50.620
[gasping]

43:52.490 --> 43:55.280
I'm not a killer!

43:56.890 --> 43:58.850
[screaming]

44:39.850 --> 44:41.890
Subtitling: difuze
