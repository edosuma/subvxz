02:36.078 --> 02:37.158
Previously on ER...

02:37.158 --> 02:39.518
Sleeping with you,
it counts as poor judgment.

02:39.518 --> 02:41.758
I thought we fit
well together.

02:41.758 --> 02:43.078
Bertha's family is suing.

02:43.078 --> 02:44.558
You're kidding.
They said they wouldn't do that.

02:44.718 --> 02:45.798
You're an intern,
you'll be protected.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.598
It's the rest of us
who are going to fry.

02:47.598 --> 02:48.918
It was a kid, right?

02:51.078 --> 02:52.438
Patient you should have saved?

02:52.438 --> 02:53.518
He was my son.

02:53.518 --> 02:55.838
Your son died in this ER?

02:55.838 --> 02:58.678
I'm not sure why I've done
anything I've done since that day.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.598
The Gates-Taggart
merger's in full swing.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.078
You mean the Brady Bunch
from hell?

03:02.238 --> 03:03.958
No, actually, it's going great,
but she'll never admit it.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.878
He's never been happier,
he just loves to complain.

03:11.078 --> 03:12.958
Oh, your lasagne was amazing.

03:13.078 --> 03:14.358
Really good, yeah.

03:14.478 --> 03:15.838
In fact, we all had seconds.

03:15.838 --> 03:20.518
Yeah, they're
hitting the books.

03:20.638 --> 03:22.318
You make it there OK?

03:22.318 --> 03:23.238
I don't have to send
a rescue party?

03:23.398 --> 03:25.278
No, but I could use a yak
with a cask of brandy.

03:25.278 --> 03:26.478
'I'll see what I can do.'

03:26.478 --> 03:27.718
Did you get any sleep?

03:27.718 --> 03:28.798
Maybe three hours.

03:28.798 --> 03:29.998
'Yeah, well, go to bed early,'

03:29.998 --> 03:32.398
and give Alex a big hug
and kiss from me.

03:32.398 --> 03:35.078
Hey, Alex,
your mom says good night.

03:35.078 --> 03:36.238
Night.

03:36.238 --> 03:39.198
That's the best
you're going to get.

03:39.198 --> 03:42.078
All right, have a good shift. Bye.

03:42.078 --> 03:44.878
The contractile vacuole
of the paramecium

03:44.878 --> 03:46.878
excretes excess water
regulating osmotic pressure.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.718
I knew that once.
How's the English paper?

03:48.718 --> 03:50.398
"In spite of terminal illness,

03:50.398 --> 03:52.358
"Johnny Gunther lives
with passion,

03:52.358 --> 03:53.798
"emphasising the author's theme

03:53.798 --> 03:55.118
"of living like there
is no tomorrow."

03:55.118 --> 03:57.438
I hope you can back that up
with specifics.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.358
If we do our homework, will you to
let us go to that party?

03:59.358 --> 04:00.998
Didn't we talk about this?

04:00.998 --> 04:02.038
Come on, it's Friday night.

04:02.038 --> 04:04.758
Yeah, and tomorrow you want to go to
Alpine valley

04:04.758 --> 04:07.157
cos you want to go
snowboarding for the weekend.

04:07.157 --> 04:09.077
Besides,
it's a blizzard out there.

04:09.077 --> 04:11.117
It's only five blocks away.

04:11.117 --> 04:12.717
We'll walk,
and we'll be home by 10:00.

04:12.717 --> 04:14.197
No, we all made a deal.
Homework.

04:14.197 --> 04:17.557
Migraine headache?

04:17.557 --> 04:18.997
Just got Imitrex.

04:18.997 --> 04:20.997
Slip and fall?
Broken coccyx,

04:20.997 --> 04:22.397
his wife's coming
to pick him up.

04:22.397 --> 04:23.717
Yeah, don't count on it.

04:23.717 --> 04:25.237
Already a foot
on the ground.

04:25.237 --> 04:26.437
Jumbo Mart's closing early.

04:26.437 --> 04:27.837
You are a snow angel.

04:27.837 --> 04:29.597
And that, my friends,
is the board.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.637
Wow, your day
was pretty qu...

04:31.637 --> 04:33.477
Hey! Do not say the "q" word.

04:33.477 --> 04:35.477
You can think it,
but you never say it.

04:35.477 --> 04:37.837
OK, well, if it
stays, uh, not busy,

04:37.837 --> 04:39.757
we'll do a suture
lab with pigs' feet.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.397
Hmm, guess I'll have
to miss that one.

04:41.557 --> 04:42.677
No, you don't.

04:42.677 --> 04:45.117
Kaya's snowed in,
you get to stay.

04:45.317 --> 04:47.357
I was up till 2:00
last night.
Good for you.

04:48.557 --> 04:49.637
Here, I got an extra one.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.077
Can't we get
somebody else to...?

04:51.237 --> 04:52.397
Take it like
a man, Grady.

04:52.397 --> 04:55.317
Oh, uh, Banfield is stuck
in Omaha at that ACEP conference.

04:55.317 --> 04:57.597
She wants you to cover
her day shift tomorrow.
Oh, n-n-n-no.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.717
She's got, like,
12 hours to try and find some...

04:59.717 --> 05:02.117
Take it like a man,
Brenner.

05:02.117 --> 05:04.357
Were you aware that Mrs Mendenhall
complained of red stools?

05:04.357 --> 05:05.437
It wasn't discussed.

05:05.437 --> 05:08.037
Your intern Dr Wade
tried to bring it up,

05:08.037 --> 05:10.677
but you told him to
"stick to the thyroid."

05:10.677 --> 05:12.037
Do you recall that?

05:12.197 --> 05:14.237
The patient was here
for routine elective surgery.

05:14.237 --> 05:16.237
But didn't Dr Wade have
important information to share?

05:16.237 --> 05:17.757
In retrospect,
yes.

05:17.757 --> 05:18.797
Is it your
standard practice

05:18.797 --> 05:20.677
to cut off
an intern's presentation?

05:20.677 --> 05:23.917
It is when you have an hour
to round on 50 patients.

05:23.917 --> 05:26.157
So you're saying being busy is an
excuse for negligence?

05:26.157 --> 05:27.957
Objection.
Lacks foundation.

05:27.957 --> 05:29.677
Doctor, did you know that
your intern

05:29.677 --> 05:31.557
went to the family
and admitted fault?

05:31.557 --> 05:32.917
Assumes facts not in evidence.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.557
Dr Wade had the moral
fortitude

05:34.557 --> 05:36.077
to be honest with the family.
Why can't you?

05:36.077 --> 05:38.317
Objection. Argumentative.

05:38.477 --> 05:39.677
Dr Wade lacks experience...
I advise my client not to answer.

05:39.677 --> 05:41.597
..it takes years
to understand the system.

05:41.597 --> 05:42.916
How long does it take
to lose your integrity?

05:43.076 --> 05:44.876
This is a public teaching hospital.
We are overwhelmed

05:44.876 --> 05:46.876
with patients
and we have the added burden

05:46.876 --> 05:48.036
of training young doctors.

05:48.036 --> 05:50.556
To get through
the day, we rely on our interns.

05:50.556 --> 05:52.956
It's not the perfect system,
but it's the best we have,

05:52.956 --> 05:54.316
things can fall
through the cracks!

05:54.316 --> 05:57.236
I said we
need a recess.

05:57.236 --> 05:59.596
Fine.

05:59.596 --> 06:02.236
You are not following
my instructions.

06:02.396 --> 06:03.476
I need to explain
what happened.

06:03.636 --> 06:05.596
No, you need
to keep your mouth shut.

06:05.596 --> 06:07.516
Answer "yes," "no,"
or "I don't know."

06:07.516 --> 06:10.916
Be a good girl, and you won't
lose your medical licence.

06:30.636 --> 06:32.356
There you go.
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

06:32.356 --> 06:33.956
I didn't order a...
A Bahama Mama.

06:34.116 --> 06:36.396
Courtesy of the gentleman
at the end of the bar.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.156
Could you just take the drink back,
thank the gentleman,

06:38.316 --> 06:39.716
and ask him to leave
me alone, please?

06:39.716 --> 06:40.996
Now, I can't do that.

06:40.996 --> 06:43.236
Why not?
He was very insistent.

06:50.156 --> 06:51.676
I was in there four hours.

06:51.836 --> 06:54.196
That is a long time
in the hot seat.

06:54.316 --> 06:55.356
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

06:55.356 --> 06:56.356
I came across like a fool.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.596
Well, that's
to be expected.

06:57.596 --> 06:58.996
I mean, their job
is to discredit you.

06:59.156 --> 07:00.596
Well, they're good at it,
after that grilling,

07:00.756 --> 07:01.916
even I think
I'm incompetent.

07:02.076 --> 07:04.356
Well, you're not,
so just take a break

07:04.356 --> 07:06.596
and I'll keep the surgical
consults to a minimum.

07:06.756 --> 07:08.156
I don't know
if you're being nice

07:08.316 --> 07:09.996
or if you don't want
me touching your patients.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.636
Hey, Simon, can you reassess
our fever girl?

07:11.756 --> 07:12.796
Yeah, no problem.

07:12.796 --> 07:13.996
Uh, if you don't mind,

07:14.156 --> 07:16.156
could you check on the interns
in the break room?

07:16.156 --> 07:18.475
Temp's down,
no source.

07:18.475 --> 07:20.035
She needs
a catheterized urine.

07:20.035 --> 07:21.995
That can be
a little traumatic.

07:21.995 --> 07:23.595
How about
conscious sedation?

07:23.595 --> 07:25.555
She might stop breathing
or drop her BP.

07:25.555 --> 07:27.275
It's too risky for such
a simple procedure.

07:27.275 --> 07:28.355
You sure?

07:28.355 --> 07:31.075
Sam, Tony  called.
I couldn't find you.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.075
'..and with two feet
of snow predicted,

07:33.235 --> 07:35.355
'authorities say to stay indoors
and off the roads...'

07:35.355 --> 07:36.795
Chicago, I hope
you're listening.

07:36.795 --> 07:37.875
Hey, Chaz.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.195
Hey, Neela, Frank.

07:39.195 --> 07:41.115
Surprised you made it in.

07:41.115 --> 07:42.475
I'm dedicated.

07:42.475 --> 07:44.075
I'm supposed to observe
every Friday night.

07:44.075 --> 07:46.635
Well, you can observe a drunk
sleeping it off in Exam Three,

07:46.635 --> 07:49.275
or you can help me with
the Christmas decorations.

07:49.275 --> 07:50.675
There's nothing going on.

07:50.675 --> 07:51.755
You might as
well go home.

07:51.755 --> 07:52.915
Now that I'm here?

07:52.915 --> 07:54.355
I was lucky
to make it this far.

07:54.355 --> 07:55.555
Good point.

07:55.555 --> 07:57.075
'Stay subcuticular
through the flap

07:57.075 --> 07:58.755
but distal to the tip.

07:58.755 --> 08:00.075
Half-buried
vertical mattress?

08:00.075 --> 08:01.075
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

08:01.075 --> 08:02.355
Looks good.

08:02.355 --> 08:06.795
So, dude, what was up
with you and Dawn last night?

08:06.795 --> 08:08.755
Nothing.

08:08.755 --> 08:11.315
Nothing?
you were slow dancing.

08:11.315 --> 08:13.435
If you can call that dancing.
Where was your wife?

08:15.795 --> 08:17.675
We couldn't get
a baby-sitter.

08:17.875 --> 08:20.595
Look, Dawn got drunk and...
You guys go to Ike's last night?

08:22.915 --> 08:24.395
There was a party.

08:24.395 --> 08:25.675
Oh, really?
I didn't hear about it.

08:25.675 --> 08:27.275
At Tracy's,
just for the interns.

08:27.275 --> 08:29.355
And the nurses.

08:29.355 --> 08:32.635
And a couple of residents.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.275
(slurps)

08:45.275 --> 08:47.395
Mmm. Sure you don't want some?

08:47.395 --> 08:48.555
Positive.

08:48.555 --> 08:52.635
Last time I saw you
was at registration.

08:52.635 --> 08:54.514
I thought we were
in the same classes.

08:54.514 --> 08:56.354
It's like you've been
avoiding me for three days.

08:56.354 --> 08:58.194
I changed
my schedule.

08:58.194 --> 08:59.474
OK.

08:59.474 --> 09:02.194
Can you believe
every flight's been cancelled?

09:02.194 --> 09:04.234
And now, of course, every
hotel room in town is booked.

09:04.234 --> 09:05.754
Yes, I know.

09:07.954 --> 09:11.554
Listen, what we talked about
that time in the break room...

09:11.554 --> 09:13.754
Yeah, I had a very
bad day that day.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.034
You know, if there's...

09:16.194 --> 09:18.914
..ever anything more
you want to discuss...

09:18.914 --> 09:22.154
I-I'm a very private person.

09:22.154 --> 09:23.714
I understand that.

09:26.834 --> 09:28.874
It would be
between you and me.

09:28.874 --> 09:30.834
I have a lot of reading to do.

09:35.394 --> 09:37.834
(sighs deeply)

09:37.994 --> 09:39.834
They say the storm
will pass by morning.

09:39.994 --> 09:42.634
Figure the airports
will open up by noon.

09:45.434 --> 09:48.114
You know, folks,
it might be a little cold outside,

09:48.114 --> 09:51.714
but we are going to
warm it up with a trip

09:51.714 --> 09:55.554
to a little place
I like to call Kokomo.

09:56.354 --> 09:59.794
MUSIC PLAYS

09:59.794 --> 10:00.874
# Aruba, Jamaica,

10:00.874 --> 10:02.754
# Ooh, I wanna take you

10:02.754 --> 10:06.594
# Bermuda, Bahama
come on, pretty mama... #

10:06.594 --> 10:08.434
He's not too bad.

10:08.434 --> 10:09.514
Hey, you know what?

10:09.514 --> 10:11.874
Good music, good company,
good booze.

10:11.874 --> 10:14.874
# ..Off the Florida keys...#
This could be an OK night.

10:16.714 --> 10:17.834
Things were slow in the OR

10:17.834 --> 10:19.154
so I borrowed a
nitrous set up.

10:19.154 --> 10:20.794
Are you sure
it's safe? Very.

10:20.794 --> 10:23.154
Sam, are we authorised
to use this?

10:23.154 --> 10:25.834
Come on, dental assistants
use this stuff like water

10:25.834 --> 10:27.154
and they don't have our
monitoring capabilities.

10:27.154 --> 10:28.834
Is there a problem? No. No.

10:31.073 --> 10:33.153
All right, we're good to go.
Very cool.

10:33.153 --> 10:34.913
Why don't you use it
down here all the time?

10:34.913 --> 10:35.953
Good question.

10:35.953 --> 10:37.713
All done.

10:37.713 --> 10:39.473
She didn't even flinch.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.993
I'll go run it to the lab.

10:41.393 --> 10:43.033
She'll be awake
in five minutes.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.393
Thank you.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.953
Mm-hmm.
Nice work.

10:46.073 --> 10:48.073
I'll, uh, get ready for the traumas.

10:49.753 --> 10:50.833
(clinking)

10:50.833 --> 10:52.153
Everybody.

10:52.153 --> 10:54.913
How you doing? can I have your
attention, please, for a second?

10:55.673 --> 10:57.353
Ah...
(coughs)

10:57.353 --> 10:59.073
Is there a doctor in the house?

10:59.073 --> 11:00.153
(laughs)

11:00.153 --> 11:02.873
I know you're
all doctors.

11:02.873 --> 11:04.633
Uh, well,
you know,

11:04.633 --> 11:07.753
we're going to be here
all night.

11:07.913 --> 11:11.393
Might as well, might as well
get to know each other. Right?

11:11.393 --> 11:12.633
I'm Archie Morris

11:12.753 --> 11:15.313
from County General in Chicago.

11:15.313 --> 11:17.273
And, uh, you
know what?

11:17.273 --> 11:20.393
Why don't we, why,
why don't we go around?

11:20.393 --> 11:21.953
OK, we'll
go around.

11:22.113 --> 11:24.033
Tell us your name,
where you're from,

11:24.033 --> 11:27.553
maybe, maybe a story
of your funniest ER patient,
whatever you want.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.993
Who wants to go first?

11:34.153 --> 11:35.673
OK. I'll start.

11:35.673 --> 11:38.033
I'll start by
introducing my colleague,

11:38.033 --> 11:40.033
the chair of our department,

11:40.033 --> 11:41.633
the very beautiful
and talented

11:41.633 --> 11:43.353
Dr Catherine Banfield.

11:43.353 --> 11:45.033
Anything you want
to share, Cate?

11:45.033 --> 11:46.673
Not really.

11:48.873 --> 11:49.953
I'll be honest.

11:49.953 --> 11:52.033
She has a reputation
as a bit of a hard-ass.

11:52.033 --> 11:54.433
Does your boyfriend
need another beer?

11:54.433 --> 11:55.753
He is not my
boyfrie...

11:55.753 --> 11:57.113
Right, Dr Cole? >

11:57.113 --> 11:58.593
Give me a refill, please.

11:58.593 --> 11:59.673
Make it a double.

11:59.673 --> 12:02.593
But, you know, deep down inside,
she really, really, really cares.

12:04.753 --> 12:06.072
Ah...

12:09.152 --> 12:11.072
Did you ever call
Gates back?

12:11.072 --> 12:12.672
Oh, man.
Good thing I'm here.

12:12.672 --> 12:15.032
Teenage girl, full arrest.

12:15.032 --> 12:16.152
Hey, what took
you guys so long?

12:16.152 --> 12:18.512
Waiting on the damn snowploughs.
Her name's Ashley.

12:18.512 --> 12:21.112
Backseat passenger,
car versus utility pole.

12:21.112 --> 12:22.312
She was ejected through
the rear window.

12:22.312 --> 12:23.392
Very drunk.

12:23.392 --> 12:24.872
Did she ever
have a pulse? No.

12:24.872 --> 12:26.112
Is that gray matter?

12:26.112 --> 12:29.112
Looks like an open
skull fracture.

12:29.112 --> 12:30.272
One, two, three.

12:30.272 --> 12:32.352
Asystole on the monitor.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.672
Resume compressions.

12:33.672 --> 12:34.952
What do you guys want?

12:34.952 --> 12:36.312
Blunt trauma, no vitals.

12:36.312 --> 12:37.792
Not an indication
for thoracotomy.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.112
She's so young.

12:39.112 --> 12:40.552
OK, let's try and fix anything
reversible.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.152
Pneumothorax,
tamponade...

12:42.152 --> 12:44.272
Bilateral chest tubes,
pericardial tap,

12:44.272 --> 12:45.512
and four units of O-neg.

12:45.512 --> 12:47.472
Sounds like a plan.
Patient number two is here.

12:47.472 --> 12:48.792
At least they're
not doing CPR.

12:48.792 --> 12:50.352
Grady wants another nurse.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.232
Well, we're a little busy.
We've got this, Sam.

12:52.232 --> 12:53.872
Go check it out.
Tell us what you need.

12:53.872 --> 12:55.112
Fine.

12:56.312 --> 12:57.392
What's the story?

12:57.512 --> 12:59.192
Driver with altered
mental status,

12:59.392 --> 13:01.992
chest trauma
and a really bad shoulder
dislocation.

13:01.992 --> 13:03.712
What's your name?

13:03.712 --> 13:05.072
Come on,
tell us your name.

13:05.192 --> 13:06.352
(groaning)

13:06.352 --> 13:09.432
Portable c-spine,
chest, pelvis and left shoulder.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.552
Alex?

13:14.552 --> 13:16.512
Alex?

13:16.632 --> 13:17.592
Mom.

13:17.712 --> 13:19.072
Alex.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.431
# I'm your Venus... # Let every
goddess embrace the 5 blade secret

14:49.431 --> 14:51.751
to 5 star legs

14:51.751 --> 14:53.151
Introducing Embrace from Gillette

14:53.151 --> 14:54.951
The best Venus ever

14:54.951 --> 14:56.871
It's the only 5 bladed razor
for women

14:56.871 --> 14:58.711
surrounded by a ribbon of moisture

14:58.711 --> 15:00.511
that hugs your curves

15:00.511 --> 15:02.551
and gets virtually every hair

15:03.471 --> 15:06.551
So now you can embrace dramatically
smooth skin

15:08.111 --> 15:10.511
Experience the brilliance of 5 blades

15:11.991 --> 15:13.511
New Venus Embrace

15:13.511 --> 15:15.311
# I'm your Venus... #

15:20.270 --> 15:23.990
When you come home
are you met by stale odours,

15:23.990 --> 15:26.230
instead of a freshness

15:26.230 --> 15:28.230
you can't help but fall for?

15:28.230 --> 15:31.270
(inhales deeply) That's because
fabrics hold on to odours

15:31.270 --> 15:33.590
and gradually release them
back into the air.

15:33.590 --> 15:35.990
New Febreze Fabric Refresher
eliminates those odours,

15:35.990 --> 15:39.190
helping your whole home stay fresh.

15:39.190 --> 15:41.710
Woof!
Hi, Dad!

15:41.710 --> 15:42.750
Febreze.

15:47.430 --> 15:49.510
You don't always need to consider

15:49.510 --> 15:52.190
professional treatments
to target precise areas

15:52.190 --> 15:55.270
Now there's the Regenerist Precision
Solutions range

15:55.270 --> 15:58.710
The Eye Lifting Serum
and new 30 Second Wrinkle Filler

15:58.710 --> 16:00.790
and Anti Ageing Lip Treatment

16:00.790 --> 16:03.830
give you younger looking skin
precisely where you want it

16:03.830 --> 16:05.910
That's the beauty of precision

16:05.910 --> 16:07.870
Regenerist Precision Solutions Range
from Olay

16:08.950 --> 16:10.830
Including what Grazia's
now calling...

16:13.950 --> 16:15.510
Love the skin you're in

16:36.630 --> 16:38.190
The new smart diesel

16:38.310 --> 16:41.230
is the most fuel-efficient
production car in the UK.

16:43.550 --> 16:46.430
At 85.6 miles per gallon combined,

16:48.270 --> 16:51.590
you'll be surprised how long
you've got between refills.

16:52.950 --> 16:54.310
Think smart.

16:56.629 --> 16:59.069
Looking for a rewarding cash ISA?

17:00.229 --> 17:02.949
Well, the new Reward ISA
is a big idea from Abbey

17:02.949 --> 17:06.549
It gives you a 1.5% tax-free return

17:07.549 --> 17:11.388
And on top of that, you'll also be
rewarded with a special bonus

17:11.388 --> 17:13.549
if you leave your money untouched

17:13.549 --> 17:16.749
2% variable
at the end of the first year

17:16.749 --> 17:19.469
leading to an impressive
3.5% tax free

17:20.709 --> 17:22.829
For more about Abbey's Reward ISA

17:22.829 --> 17:24.868
call:

17:24.868 --> 17:27.589
The Reward ISA is available from
branches of...

17:29.749 --> 17:31.789
which have joined the Santander Group

17:32.589 --> 17:34.549
Together we are Santander

18:09.989 --> 18:11.629
Did you call
her parents?
I left a
voicemail.

18:11.789 --> 18:14.349
The cops should go to her house.
I could use a second THORA-SEAL.

18:14.469 --> 18:15.829
Be right back.

18:18.309 --> 18:19.429
I'm in, bag him.

18:19.589 --> 18:22.669
Tony, wake up.
Alex snuck out of the house.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.509
He was in a car crash.

18:24.629 --> 18:26.109
You need to check on Sarah.

18:26.269 --> 18:27.589
There's not much
blood in the chest.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.189
Let's get O-neg and a vent.

18:29.189 --> 18:30.709
Are you ready for the reduction?

18:30.709 --> 18:32.748
Soon as we
tape this in.

18:32.748 --> 18:34.788
Sam, I can take over. No, I'm OK.

18:34.788 --> 18:37.428
Suri can do it. No, she's
got another trauma out there.

18:37.428 --> 18:39.148
Look, I'm not going
anywhere, OK?

18:39.148 --> 18:40.668
Let's fix this shoulder
before the paralytics wear off.

18:40.668 --> 18:42.508
OK, come back as soon
as you're done in there.

18:42.508 --> 18:44.508
Ready, steady, pulling.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.468
The humeral head is stuck.

18:52.468 --> 18:55.388
Let's try again, I'll give you
direct pressure. Go for it.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.708
No, it won't budge.
I'll get the skin hooks.

19:00.708 --> 19:03.628
Labs are ready. Trauma panel,
type and cross four?

19:03.628 --> 19:05.748
And blood alcohol level.
No, he doesn't drink.

19:05.748 --> 19:07.908
I need you to keep still...

19:07.908 --> 19:10.268
Doc, is the girl
gonna make it?
Pretty unlikely.

19:10.268 --> 19:12.188
Well, how about the boy?
It's too soon to tell.

19:12.188 --> 19:13.588
Backseat passenger...

19:13.588 --> 19:16.228
head trauma or drugs
and alcohol.

19:16.228 --> 19:18.428
OK, titrate ativan
and get him a head CT.

19:18.428 --> 19:20.468
Also has a
sternal contusion.

19:20.468 --> 19:21.948
KKG and a chest X-ray.

19:21.948 --> 19:23.228
Where did you put her?

19:23.228 --> 19:24.908
Leo, try to relax.
I'm right here, Ashley!

19:24.908 --> 19:27.748
No, no, that
is not a good answer.

19:27.748 --> 19:29.508
I want to talk
to your supervisor.

19:29.508 --> 19:30.788
Skin hooks.

19:30.988 --> 19:32.988
The blood bank is out of O-neg,
and Red Cross can't deliver
because of the snow.

19:32.988 --> 19:34.748
He's got a good crit.
Yeah, for now.

19:34.748 --> 19:37.188
< Hello, what is up
with the O-neg?

19:37.188 --> 19:40.068
< We have multiple
trauma victims here.

19:40.068 --> 19:41.388
We should get Dawn
in here.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.428
< Uh, send O-positive.

19:42.428 --> 19:43.908
The patient is a male.

19:43.908 --> 19:45.148
That'll work until
we get the cross match.

19:47.428 --> 19:48.868
Pulling.

19:50.948 --> 19:52.268
There you go.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.228
Get a pulse back at the wrist.

19:57.228 --> 19:59.428
OK, shoulder immobiliser
and right to CT.

19:59.428 --> 20:00.828
All right.

20:00.828 --> 20:02.148
I got the life-pack.

20:02.148 --> 20:04.188
The O2 tank is full.

20:04.188 --> 20:05.748
The chest tube is on water seal.

20:05.748 --> 20:06.867
I'll go check on Grady.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.347
I'll help you
with the sling.

20:08.347 --> 20:09.867
I think I've got it.

20:11.867 --> 20:12.987
'I got a little musical game'

20:12.987 --> 20:15.387
that we're gonna have
some fun with, OK?

20:15.387 --> 20:17.827
And the hotel has
generously donated prizes

20:17.827 --> 20:19.227
to all the winners.

20:19.227 --> 20:21.587
Stuffed mushrooms
and, uh, potato skins.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.747
Your choice.

20:22.747 --> 20:24.747
OK...yeah. You guys ready?

20:24.747 --> 20:26.747
< OK.

20:26.747 --> 20:31.467
# Oh, the weather
outside is...

20:34.467 --> 20:36.147
# Frightful

20:36.147 --> 20:40.067
# But the fire is so...

20:43.227 --> 20:44.307
No winners yet.

20:44.307 --> 20:46.187
# Delightful

20:47.107 --> 20:51.907
# And since we've
no place to go

20:51.907 --> 20:54.147
# Let it...

20:56.267 --> 20:57.507
Stop.

20:57.507 --> 20:58.867
LAUGHTER

20:58.867 --> 21:01.347
Let it stop.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.947
Make it stop. (laughs)

21:03.947 --> 21:05.467
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

21:08.467 --> 21:10.147
Whoo!

21:10.147 --> 21:13.027
Stranded in Omaha
in the dead of winter,

21:13.027 --> 21:15.907
listening to lame-ass music.

21:15.907 --> 21:17.987
Does this suck or what?

21:17.987 --> 21:19.267
LAUGHTER

21:19.267 --> 21:20.547
You know what,

21:20.547 --> 21:24.067
Dermatology gets
to go to Maui.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.347
Radiology to Acapulco?

21:27.347 --> 21:30.787
I mean, just like always,
ER gets no respect.

21:30.787 --> 21:31.947
Uh-huh.

21:31.947 --> 21:34.827
I mean, we bust our asses
taking care of people

21:34.827 --> 21:38.427
that no-one else wants
to touch...24-7.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.507
We deserve better.

21:41.347 --> 21:43.506
Got any Foreigner?

21:43.506 --> 21:44.866
Do you think we deserve better?

21:44.866 --> 21:46.866
(ALL) Yeah!

21:48.986 --> 21:52.106
ROCK MUSIC PLAYS

22:06.106 --> 22:08.186
Ready, and...switch.

22:11.586 --> 22:13.946
No tension pneumo,
no effusion.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.426
Did they ever
find the parents?

22:15.586 --> 22:16.866
Two more units,
and then call it.

22:16.986 --> 22:18.946
(DAWN) Faster and deeper, Ryan.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.586
How is the CT?

22:20.746 --> 22:22.546
Abdomen's benign,
no brain bleed.

22:22.546 --> 22:24.306
But he won't wake up.

22:24.306 --> 22:25.466
Oh, my God.

22:25.586 --> 22:27.026
Front seat passenger...

22:27.026 --> 22:28.146
You OK?

22:28.146 --> 22:29.906
Broken wrist
on the right.

22:29.906 --> 22:31.866
I need to get
back out there.
OK.

22:31.866 --> 22:33.506
Prep a subclavian
on the right.

22:33.506 --> 22:36.386
How is he? How does he look, huh?

22:36.386 --> 22:39.106
Were you drinking?
No.

22:39.106 --> 22:41.946
A little, but he wasn't.

22:41.946 --> 22:44.586
You were supposed to be home
studying... you knew that.

22:44.586 --> 22:45.986
We were.
You snuck out.

22:45.986 --> 22:47.226
It wasn't like that.

22:47.226 --> 22:49.426
He has a learner's
permit, Sarah.

22:49.426 --> 22:50.786
He needs an adult
in that car.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.466
Ashley was too drunk to drive.
He was just trying to help.

22:53.466 --> 22:56.226
You can't call Tony
or you can't call me or a cab?

22:56.226 --> 22:57.706
What the hell is wrong
with you, Sarah?

22:57.706 --> 22:59.306
What's wrong with you?
Introducer needle.

23:01.826 --> 23:04.546
Uh, I need a thin wall,
not a 25, Sam.

23:04.546 --> 23:05.586
You got this?

23:05.586 --> 23:07.026
Yeah.

23:07.026 --> 23:08.106
Let's check you
over, Sarah.

23:08.106 --> 23:09.426
I want to stay here.

23:09.426 --> 23:10.906
Back in a few
minutes, OK?

23:19.665 --> 23:24.705
# Said can I take you home
where we can be alone?

23:24.705 --> 23:28.705
# Next we were movin' on
and he was with me, yeah, me

23:28.705 --> 23:31.905
# We were movin' on
and singin' that same old song

23:31.905 --> 23:34.505
# Yeah, with me singin'

23:34.505 --> 23:36.745
# I love rock and roll

23:36.745 --> 23:39.225
# Put another dime
in the jukebox, baby

23:39.225 --> 23:41.625
# I love rock and roll

23:41.625 --> 23:45.185
# So come and take your time
and dance with me. #

23:45.185 --> 23:48.065
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

23:49.745 --> 23:51.105
Dude, you have got
the coolest boss

23:51.105 --> 23:52.545
in the whole world.

23:52.545 --> 23:53.865
Whoo!

23:53.865 --> 23:55.465
How y'all doing?

23:55.465 --> 23:56.785
(slurred):
All right...

23:58.345 --> 24:00.505
Uh, why don't we get
Archie up here,

24:00.505 --> 24:02.465
so we can do a duet.

24:02.465 --> 24:03.945
CHEERING

24:06.505 --> 24:10.905
Give him some love!
come on!

24:10.905 --> 24:12.105
CROWD: Archie! Archie! Archie!

24:12.105 --> 24:14.305
Archie! Archie!
Archie! Archie!

24:18.505 --> 24:20.065
All right, ooh...

24:20.065 --> 24:20.985
(laughs)

24:20.985 --> 24:22.945
What do we want
to sing, huh?

24:22.945 --> 24:24.905
I don't, I don't...
White Christmas?

24:24.905 --> 24:26.465
< Yeah.

24:28.065 --> 24:29.145
(groans)

24:29.145 --> 24:30.385
LAUGHTER

24:30.385 --> 24:31.745
I don't think so.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.225
Freebird!

24:39.105 --> 24:41.025
Do you know
Walk This Way"?

24:41.025 --> 24:43.225
CHEERING

24:43.225 --> 24:44.465
You know Walk This Way?

24:44.465 --> 24:45.785
Whoo!

24:47.505 --> 24:48.945
Tell you what, guys.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.865
Uh, we, we are going
to Walk This Way,

24:50.865 --> 24:52.905
GROANING
..because I think

24:52.905 --> 24:55.184
the show is over.
I'm sorry.

24:55.184 --> 24:57.104
Let's get you
some coffee.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.744
Let's get you some coffee.

24:58.744 --> 25:01.144
However, ACEP rocks,
I mean it.

25:01.144 --> 25:02.984
It's, uh, you OK?
Whoo!

25:02.984 --> 25:04.264
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

25:07.664 --> 25:09.584
Good night, Omaha!

25:14.544 --> 25:15.584
Hold compressions.

25:20.184 --> 25:22.224
Asystole. That's it.

25:23.664 --> 25:26.384
1:57, I'll get a shroud.

25:29.744 --> 25:31.544
I'll clean her up.

25:31.544 --> 25:33.664
Let's move her
to the suture room.

25:39.384 --> 25:42.224
Tidal volume 500,
AC 14.

25:42.224 --> 25:43.664
Turn him down to 80 percent.

25:43.664 --> 25:45.024
You called it?

25:50.984 --> 25:52.864
Crit's good, 41.

25:52.864 --> 25:54.904
Blood alcohol
level is zero.

25:54.904 --> 25:56.144
He wasn't drinking.

25:56.144 --> 25:58.944
< Sam.

26:00.504 --> 26:01.584
CT's all good.

26:01.584 --> 26:04.384
Small hemothorax
and a bad concussion.

26:04.384 --> 26:05.424
Dawn, this ET tube

26:05.424 --> 26:07.944
can use a little
suctioning.

26:07.944 --> 26:08.984
You want to step out?

26:12.344 --> 26:13.944
Sarah's here.
She's getting a cast.

26:13.944 --> 26:15.264
Yeah, I know.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.344
Things seem
stable in there.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.744
How are you doing?

26:24.864 --> 26:27.064
He was driving
some drunk girl's car.

26:29.024 --> 26:31.183
She just died.

26:32.823 --> 26:35.743
And I don't know
if he's going to wake up.

26:44.263 --> 26:45.783
I'm sorry, I...

26:45.783 --> 26:47.903
I shouldn't
have given in to them.

26:47.903 --> 26:50.943
What are you talking about?

26:50.943 --> 26:53.303
I let them go to the party.

26:59.423 --> 27:00.423
You what?

27:02.183 --> 27:03.143
I tried to call you.

27:07.823 --> 27:11.103
No. No-no, no, no.

27:11.103 --> 27:12.823
We are not doing this now.

27:12.823 --> 27:14.743
Sam.

28:50.382 --> 28:53.462
Now looking good is so easy

28:53.462 --> 28:56.942
you can do it... without looking

28:57.342 --> 29:00.382
New Olay Complete Touch of Foundation

29:00.382 --> 29:01.942
Its rich Olay moisture

29:01.942 --> 29:04.462
combines with a touch
of Max Factor foundation

29:04.462 --> 29:07.422
The easy way to a sheer even tone

29:07.422 --> 29:09.542
So easy, Cosmo's
beauty director said,

29:09.542 --> 29:11.662
"Who needs an arsenal
of potions, when...

29:14.342 --> 29:15.502
Love the skin you're in

29:47.301 --> 29:50.741
What makes us... us?

29:50.861 --> 29:53.021
The two-part guide to understanding
people,

29:53.101 --> 29:54.861
free this weekend in:

31:56.700 --> 31:58.380
All right, all right.

31:58.380 --> 31:59.860
There you go.

32:01.100 --> 32:02.820
(coughs)

32:02.820 --> 32:05.380
Now you're going to feel
a whole lot better.

32:05.380 --> 32:06.740
All right?

32:09.580 --> 32:10.980
You know I hate
to say this,

32:10.980 --> 32:12.660
but there's
a lesson here.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.700
(groans)
Yep.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.580
Red wine and scotch
don't mix.

32:17.580 --> 32:20.180
Gotta remember that.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.380
You OK?
Mm.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.220
Want to take
a little rest?
Mm.

32:26.100 --> 32:27.740
Let me know
when you're ready.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.820
(groans)

32:31.820 --> 32:33.860
(thumps feet)

32:41.380 --> 32:43.460
Sorry.

32:48.380 --> 32:49.460
You know,

32:49.460 --> 32:52.859
my dad was born in Lincoln,

32:52.859 --> 32:55.299
not too far from here.

32:57.139 --> 32:58.939
When I was little,

32:58.939 --> 33:00.979
he used to drive us
to my grandma's house.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.299
I remember the ride took forever.

33:05.739 --> 33:08.659
He'd, he'd yell at me for
kicking the back of his seat,

33:08.659 --> 33:11.859
or getting crumbs
on the floor,

33:11.859 --> 33:14.499
or breathing
too loud.

33:14.499 --> 33:15.979
(chuckles)

33:15.979 --> 33:18.939
That was my dad.

33:18.939 --> 33:21.019
Yeah.

33:21.019 --> 33:23.259
You know, he, uh,
he died last year.

33:23.259 --> 33:27.819
We hadn't spoken
in years.

33:27.819 --> 33:29.779
He's got this storage locker

33:29.779 --> 33:31.699
in Indiana.

33:31.699 --> 33:34.539
They can
either trash it

33:34.539 --> 33:37.379
or I can go deal
with his stuff.

33:37.379 --> 33:40.259
It could be a complete waste
of time.

33:40.259 --> 33:45.019
Or maybe I'd learn something

33:45.019 --> 33:46.859
about a father
I didn't really know.

33:52.099 --> 33:53.859
Ortho can take Alex
in an hour.

33:53.859 --> 33:56.579
No problem.
His vitals are stable.

33:56.579 --> 33:58.939
Dr Brenner, Leo's
positive on opiates,

33:58.939 --> 34:00.819
benzos
and marijuana.

34:00.819 --> 34:02.099
OK.

34:02.099 --> 34:03.659
How about, um, aspirin
and Tylenol?

34:03.659 --> 34:05.659
We sent them.
None detected.

34:07.419 --> 34:08.819
See that?

34:08.819 --> 34:10.539
I get attitude from
all the interns.

34:10.539 --> 34:12.579
Well, maybe they don't like
you picking on one of them.

34:12.579 --> 34:13.978
You mean Andrew?

34:13.978 --> 34:15.059
We've worked
through that.

34:15.059 --> 34:17.418
When I was an intern,
I was friends with
all my residents.

34:17.418 --> 34:19.179
Well, you're more
like an attending.

34:19.179 --> 34:20.579
I don't feel that way.

34:20.579 --> 34:21.619
Well, you make
them nervous.

34:21.619 --> 34:23.699
You showed them
some teeth.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.779
Man, no-one's delivering pizza
in this snow.

34:25.779 --> 34:27.659
How can you be hungry
at a time like this?

34:27.659 --> 34:28.737
You still got to eat?

34:28.737 --> 34:30.858
I may have to nuke
the pigs' feet.

34:30.858 --> 34:32.257
Has anyone seen
trauma two's chart?

34:32.257 --> 34:34.178
Right here,
Dr Rasgotra.

34:34.178 --> 34:37.297
Oh, Brenner,
I got family in here from Gilda...

34:37.297 --> 34:38.777
Laverne:
I need some help here!

34:41.418 --> 34:42.618
Wait a minute, Chaz.

34:42.618 --> 34:44.697
Weren't you with that
Ashley girl?
Yeah.

34:44.697 --> 34:46.257
Somebody has to talk
to her brother.

34:46.257 --> 34:47.737
No, I'm supposed
to observe.
Mm-mnh.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.058
I've been stalling
for an hour.

34:49.058 --> 34:49.658
You're all I've got.

34:54.378 --> 34:55.978
This is Chaz Pratt,

34:55.978 --> 34:58.298
he's one of
our student doctors.

35:00.138 --> 35:01.818
Where's Ashley?

35:03.098 --> 35:04.458
You two are
the brothers?

35:04.458 --> 35:06.218
No, just Tyler.

35:06.218 --> 35:07.978
And you are...?

35:07.978 --> 35:09.898
The baby-sitter, I guess.

35:09.898 --> 35:11.618
Tyler's supposed to hang out
at my place till midnight.

35:11.618 --> 35:13.418
That was two hours ago.

35:13.418 --> 35:15.098
Picked up the message
and the little guy
was freaking out,

35:15.098 --> 35:16.218
so I brought him in.

35:16.218 --> 35:17.458
Can I see my sister?

35:17.458 --> 35:19.618
Her doctors are working on her.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.498
Where are their parents?

35:21.498 --> 35:22.498
In Europe for
a couple of weeks.

35:22.498 --> 35:23.618
You got it from here?

35:23.618 --> 35:26.098
I gotta get my truck
towed or dug out or something.

35:30.178 --> 35:31.658
Satting well at 50%.

35:31.658 --> 35:33.458
Less than a 100 cc's from the chest.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.938
Sam, I let them go to the party
as a reward

35:36.938 --> 35:38.778
because they busted their ass
on their homework.

35:38.778 --> 35:39.818
We all agreed
no party tonight.

35:39.818 --> 35:41.298
I quizzed him,
he knew it all.

35:41.298 --> 35:42.938
Great.
I tried to call you.

35:42.938 --> 35:44.418
They walked
to the party.

35:44.418 --> 35:46.578
I don't know what to do.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.378
I'm trying to be his friend,
I'm trying to be a good father.

35:48.378 --> 35:50.378
Tony?

35:57.058 --> 35:58.538
Did Ashley really die?

35:58.538 --> 36:00.378
Yeah.

36:00.378 --> 36:02.298
(SHE CRIES)

36:02.378 --> 36:05.217
I can't believe it.

36:05.337 --> 36:07.257
That is awful.

36:07.377 --> 36:09.257
It is.

36:09.377 --> 36:12.057
I'm sorry.

36:12.177 --> 36:14.097
Alex, is doing better.

36:14.257 --> 36:17.137
Come on, let's go get
you some Kleenex.

36:17.297 --> 36:19.137
RASGOTRA:
Head CT was negative?

36:19.297 --> 36:20.697
LAVERNE:
No fracture, no bleed.

36:20.817 --> 36:21.737
Is that Leo?

36:21.897 --> 36:23.177
Leo the kid that calls
you every night?

36:23.297 --> 36:24.217
What's going on?

36:24.377 --> 36:26.657
Looks like a bad drug OD.
He's had eight of Ativan.

36:26.657 --> 36:28.097
I told him not to
take that crap.

36:28.097 --> 36:29.217
What crap?

36:29.217 --> 36:33.897
It's called trail mix. Kids steal
prescription pills from their
parents,

36:33.897 --> 36:35.417
and everyone throws it
into a big bowl.

36:36.177 --> 36:37.617
Sat's are down, intubation tray.

36:37.737 --> 36:38.937
GATES: you know what?

36:39.097 --> 36:41.177
It could be antidepressants.
Push bicarb.

36:41.337 --> 36:43.737
OK, 100 milli-equivalents
over two minutes.

36:45.497 --> 36:46.617
Come on.

37:01.657 --> 37:04.577
Nothing but news
and infomercials.

37:04.697 --> 37:05.857
When can I see Ashley?

37:05.857 --> 37:08.417
In a little bit.

37:08.537 --> 37:11.737
We've got some magazines.

37:11.897 --> 37:14.097
Eh, I know where they have
some video games.

37:14.217 --> 37:16.577
I want to see my sister.

37:16.697 --> 37:18.577
OK.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.337
I'll go check
with her doctors.

37:28.737 --> 37:31.457
Hey, Frank, I need Brenner to talk
to the little brother.

37:31.457 --> 37:32.497
He's all tied up.

37:32.657 --> 37:34.017
Well, how about
a social worker?

37:34.137 --> 37:35.577
At 3:00 in the morning?

37:35.737 --> 37:37.097
Is there an on-call
chaplain or something?

37:37.097 --> 37:38.217
BRENNER: Trauma two's open.

37:38.377 --> 37:40.016
Grab a cut down tray,
he's in tamponade.

37:40.176 --> 37:42.096
Chaz, find me
an ultrasound.

37:45.016 --> 37:46.416
Table for two?

37:46.616 --> 37:48.336
Some, uh, coffee
for you folks?

37:48.456 --> 37:50.296
Definitely.
I'll have some hot tea.

37:50.456 --> 37:53.656
We've got a couple of
night owl specials.

37:53.776 --> 37:56.816
A, um, apple pancakes

37:56.976 --> 37:58.856
and a spicy
breakfast burrito.

37:58.936 --> 38:00.136
Ooh, what's in the burrito?

38:00.296 --> 38:02.816
Uh, eggs, onions,
bell peppers,

38:02.976 --> 38:07.176
uh, chorizo, jalapeno jack cheese
and chunky salsa.

38:08.016 --> 38:10.176
MORRIS:
One of those and a large OJ.

38:10.176 --> 38:11.656
I'll have some dry toast.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.736
And some napkins
when you get a chance.

38:13.856 --> 38:14.856
Oh, you need silverware.

38:15.016 --> 38:17.616
I completely forgot to set
your table. Pregnancy brain.

38:17.616 --> 38:19.376
I'd forget my head if
it wasn't screwed on.

38:19.496 --> 38:21.096
(CHUCKLES)

38:27.776 --> 38:29.336
It's called a pericardial
window.

38:29.496 --> 38:32.176
They're removing blood clots
from around Leo's heart

38:32.296 --> 38:33.696
so it can beat stronger.

38:33.696 --> 38:35.296
I can't watch this.
All right.

38:35.416 --> 38:36.536
Dawn.

38:36.696 --> 38:38.416
No problem.
Come on, Sarah.

38:38.656 --> 38:40.136
I'll let you know
how it's goes.
TAGGART:
heart rate's up to 120.

38:40.296 --> 38:41.336
Run another
litre of saline.

38:41.496 --> 38:43.096
What for?
In case we're behind on fluids.

38:43.256 --> 38:44.616
What if he's bleeding
in the belly?

38:44.776 --> 38:45.936
CT was negative.
Yeah, well,

38:46.096 --> 38:47.936
things change.
I want to get Neela in here.

38:48.096 --> 38:49.416
All right, let's
run another crit

38:49.576 --> 38:50.496
and Fast exam.
That's what she would do.

38:50.496 --> 38:51.736
Maybe Grady can break out
and reassess him.

38:51.856 --> 38:53.416
Blood loss is unlikely.

38:53.576 --> 38:55.496
I think it's hypoxia,
dehydration, pain.

38:55.656 --> 38:57.776
What do you know?
I want a surgeon in here.

38:57.776 --> 38:59.336
How's he doing?

38:59.456 --> 39:00.856
OK. Good.

39:00.856 --> 39:02.616
Have you guys seen a little boy?

39:02.616 --> 39:03.936
I left him in the break room.

39:03.936 --> 39:04.976
He's not in here.

39:05.096 --> 39:06.416
All right.

39:23.935 --> 39:26.575
Why won't she wake up?

39:28.695 --> 39:30.415
Why won't she wake up?

39:33.535 --> 39:34.575
Pressure's up to 110.

39:34.735 --> 39:37.055
That's a hell of a lot
better than 60.

39:37.055 --> 39:38.215
Cardiac team's waiting
in the OR.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.255
Let's go.

39:39.375 --> 39:41.935
Nice work, doctor.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.415
He's in sinus tach.

39:46.575 --> 39:48.895
His crit went
from 41 to 38.

39:49.055 --> 39:50.735
Could be just dilutional
from all the fluids.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.215
That's what I said.

39:52.415 --> 39:54.055
Or it could be pain.
We could dial up
the sedation.

39:54.055 --> 39:55.255
You'd miss an abdominal bleed.

39:55.255 --> 39:56.535
Ultrasound's still negative.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.815
He's not bleeding
in the belly.

39:57.935 --> 39:59.215
Or the chest.

39:59.375 --> 40:01.815
Well, you can't be sure of
that without a repeat CT.

40:01.935 --> 40:03.495
You know what?

40:03.655 --> 40:04.895
I really think that
my kid deserves

40:05.055 --> 40:06.415
a surgical attending.
Where's Dubenko?

40:06.575 --> 40:07.455
Or where's Crenshaw?

40:07.615 --> 40:08.735
Not available.
What?

40:08.855 --> 40:09.975
Dawn's here.

40:10.135 --> 40:11.095
Alex is in good hands.
Let's take a break.

40:11.215 --> 40:13.175
I don't need a break!

40:14.415 --> 40:16.215
You want a cup
of coffee or something to eat?

40:16.215 --> 40:17.295
You never listen to me.

40:17.455 --> 40:19.655
I'm checking for blood loss,
I ordered a third CBC.

40:19.815 --> 40:21.295
Neela and Brenner agree
with my plan.

40:21.455 --> 40:22.575
You've got
to trust us, Sam.

40:22.735 --> 40:24.575
Trust you?
why would I trust you?

40:24.735 --> 40:26.095
I wanted Alex to stay home
and study.

40:26.215 --> 40:27.135
You knew that!

40:27.335 --> 40:28.375
Sam...
What?!

40:28.535 --> 40:29.695
You'd rather be his friend
than an adult.

40:29.855 --> 40:31.055
Come here. I know
how to be a parent.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.375
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

40:32.495 --> 40:33.575
Why would I believe that?

40:33.735 --> 40:35.015
You don't know anything
about their friends,

40:35.175 --> 40:36.455
you let them do
whatever they want.

40:36.655 --> 40:37.815
You've made mistake after
mistake with your kid,

40:37.975 --> 40:38.735
and now you want to do
the same with mine.

40:38.735 --> 40:40.535
Yeah, right! Go ahead
and keep screwing up Sarah,

40:40.695 --> 40:43.935
but I am sure as hell not going
to let you near Alex again.

40:44.055 --> 40:45.575
I know you're upset

40:45.735 --> 40:47.295
and I know you don't
mean that. Don't!

40:50.374 --> 40:52.254
OK.

40:52.374 --> 40:54.334
It's OK.

40:58.574 --> 41:01.134
I need to be with him.

41:02.254 --> 41:04.814
I saw my classmates were
doing it in our med school

41:04.894 --> 41:07.334
and during residency,

41:07.334 --> 41:09.254
but I wasn't going
there, you know.

41:09.414 --> 41:11.014
I mean, every other
night on call.

41:11.134 --> 41:13.014
That's no way to raise a kid.

41:13.134 --> 41:16.054
You know, so... I put if off.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.654
Oh, nothing wrong with that.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.614
I mean, by the time
I was pregnant,

41:22.774 --> 41:25.934
I had a good salary,
a good schedule.

41:26.054 --> 41:27.934
I was secure.

41:28.054 --> 41:29.374
I was older.

41:29.494 --> 41:32.414
A lot of people
prefer it that way.

41:34.014 --> 41:35.974
Hmm.

41:37.694 --> 41:40.654
When we lost Daryl, I was 40.

41:42.254 --> 41:44.174
But we tried,

41:44.294 --> 41:46.334
you know.

41:46.494 --> 41:49.334
You know, eventually
it worked out.

41:49.494 --> 41:51.374
I mean, everything looked
pretty great.

41:51.494 --> 41:55.174
The baby looked perfect
on the ultrasound.

41:55.294 --> 41:58.134
(SIGHS)

41:58.254 --> 42:01.574
And...

42:03.654 --> 42:06.614
...then at three months...

42:08.534 --> 42:11.134
You had a miscarriage?

42:11.134 --> 42:12.654
I'm sorry.

42:12.814 --> 42:16.214
I just took it as a sign
it wasn't supposed to be.

42:17.574 --> 42:19.214
(SIGHS)

42:22.973 --> 42:25.213
Look, I made a choice.

42:25.373 --> 42:27.693
I devoted myself to my training,
to my profession.

42:27.853 --> 42:31.813
And now, I'm Chief
of an academic department. Yeah.

42:31.813 --> 42:33.373
That is a huge
accomplishment.

42:33.493 --> 42:34.533
I invested in my career,

42:34.653 --> 42:37.373
I've been a great success.

42:39.533 --> 42:41.493
(SIGHS)

42:45.933 --> 42:49.093
You can't have everything.

46:39.451 --> 46:41.131
Yummy cheese for good fun.

47:35.970 --> 47:37.890
I thought you
were sleeping.

47:40.410 --> 47:42.090
Leo's surgery went well.

47:42.210 --> 47:43.450
They fixed his heart.

47:43.570 --> 47:45.050
Good.

47:45.210 --> 47:48.570
And, uh, Alex is going up
for shoulder surgery.

47:48.690 --> 47:50.650
Want to go see him?

47:51.690 --> 47:53.610
I hate that room.

47:53.730 --> 47:56.370
OK. Later, then, huh?

47:56.490 --> 47:57.810
Yeah.

47:57.930 --> 47:59.290
You OK in here?

48:00.410 --> 48:02.770
OK. Why don't you lie down
and get some sleep?

48:06.330 --> 48:08.250
I heard Sam yelling.

48:08.370 --> 48:10.690
Yeah, she's mad at me.

48:10.810 --> 48:12.570
She's right to be.

48:12.690 --> 48:15.370
It'll be OK.

48:15.490 --> 48:16.930
DAWN: His third crit went up.

48:17.050 --> 48:18.170
That's good.

48:18.170 --> 48:19.250
How's he doing?

48:19.410 --> 48:20.410
Better with fluids
and versed.

48:20.530 --> 48:21.610
Brought you a water.

48:21.730 --> 48:23.490
Would you just put that
on the desk, please?

48:23.610 --> 48:25.490
Heart rate's 160.

48:25.610 --> 48:26.730
Pressure's down to 80 systolic.

48:26.850 --> 48:28.010
Get Neela back in here.

48:28.170 --> 48:30.050
He needs blood.
Sam, you don't know that.

48:30.210 --> 48:31.290
Yeah, well,
it's my best guess, OK?

48:31.450 --> 48:32.570
There are two units
in the cooler.

48:32.730 --> 48:33.730
Where do you think
he's bleeding?

48:33.890 --> 48:34.770
It doesn't matter where.
We need to transfuse.

48:36.050 --> 48:37.530
Give me the ultrasound.
Stat portable chest.

48:37.650 --> 48:38.890
Repeat the hemocue.

48:38.890 --> 48:40.250
Simon, you see
any P waves?

48:40.370 --> 48:41.530
What?

48:41.690 --> 48:43.290
They're there. You
just can't see them.

48:43.410 --> 48:45.530
Excuse me.

48:45.690 --> 48:46.689
Hey, I can't get
to the subclavian.

48:46.849 --> 48:47.809
BRENNER:
Breath sounds a bit down here.

48:47.929 --> 48:48.929
All right.

48:49.089 --> 48:49.929
Place another
chest tube.

48:49.929 --> 48:51.449
BRENNER: Tony, I need to prep.
What are you doing?

48:51.449 --> 48:52.489
Everybody back off.

48:52.649 --> 48:54.169
I'm gonna run the EKG
at twice the speed.

48:54.329 --> 48:55.369
It'll spread out
the complexes.

48:55.489 --> 48:56.529
I need to ultrasound.

48:56.649 --> 48:57.769
There might be hemothorax.

48:57.929 --> 48:59.929
GATES: All right.
Shut up and look.

49:00.049 --> 49:01.169
No P waves.

49:01.289 --> 49:02.929
It's not sinus tack.

49:03.089 --> 49:05.009
It's SVT. We need
to cardiovert.

49:05.809 --> 49:06.849
He's not bleeding.

49:07.049 --> 49:08.689
He's got an arrhythmia
from a bruised heart.

49:08.889 --> 49:11.529
Let's get them
on there, Sam.
Hold on.

49:11.649 --> 49:12.849
Clear.

49:17.609 --> 49:18.929
Heart rate's 82.

49:19.049 --> 49:20.249
Looks like normal sinus.

49:20.369 --> 49:23.049
DAWN: BP's 110/74.

49:23.049 --> 49:24.169
Thank you.

49:24.169 --> 49:25.569
CHAZ: Dr Brenner?

49:25.729 --> 49:27.169
Yeah?
You got a minute?

49:27.289 --> 49:29.289
Looks like I do now.

49:30.729 --> 49:32.609
Let's run a 12 lead.

49:32.769 --> 49:35.329
RASGOTRA: CK, troponin
and cardiac echo.

49:35.329 --> 49:37.529
The girl who died... her little
brother's here by himself.

49:37.649 --> 49:38.729
What about the parents?

49:38.889 --> 49:41.089
They're out of town,
and he saw her body.

49:41.249 --> 49:44.769
I don't really think he gets it,
but I don't know what to do.

49:44.929 --> 49:47.169
OK. OK,
well, come on.

49:47.289 --> 49:49.649
I'll talk to him.

49:49.769 --> 49:51.649
WOMAN: More coffee?

49:51.809 --> 49:53.689
No. Just the
check, please.

49:53.849 --> 49:55.329
Okey dokey.
I'll be right back.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.529
(PHONE RINGS)

49:59.809 --> 50:01.449
Hello.

50:01.569 --> 50:04.169
Yes.

50:04.289 --> 50:05.569
Oh. Oh. Hold on.

50:05.729 --> 50:08.569
Just a minute. A room
just opened up at the hotel.

50:08.569 --> 50:09.689
Great.

50:09.809 --> 50:11.609
Just one room.

50:11.729 --> 50:12.769
Oh. Yeah, go ahead.

50:12.889 --> 50:13.969
Hmm...

50:14.089 --> 50:15.649
Go ahead. No.
I can hang out here.

50:15.649 --> 50:17.209
You sure?

50:17.329 --> 50:18.289
Yeah.

50:19.409 --> 50:21.448
All right, I'll take it.

50:21.568 --> 50:23.008
OK. Thank you.

50:23.128 --> 50:24.408
(SIGHS)

50:24.528 --> 50:26.488
Uh, here you go.

50:26.608 --> 50:28.008
You folks have a...

50:28.168 --> 50:30.848
Oh. I think my baby
just kicked first time.

50:31.928 --> 50:34.208
(LAUGHS)

50:34.328 --> 50:35.688
Hmm.

50:35.808 --> 50:37.008
That's wonderful.

50:37.128 --> 50:38.768
Uh, can you feel it?

50:38.888 --> 50:40.728
It's like popcorn popping.

50:40.728 --> 50:41.848
Yes, it is.

50:42.648 --> 50:44.728
Congratulations.

50:44.728 --> 50:46.568
I got to go call my husband.

50:46.688 --> 50:47.928
(LAUGHS)

50:54.488 --> 50:56.448
Whoosh!

51:01.328 --> 51:02.848
Hey, Tyler.

51:02.968 --> 51:04.528
Hi.

51:04.648 --> 51:06.048
This is Dr Brenner.

51:06.168 --> 51:07.248
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

51:07.248 --> 51:09.208
Is Ashley awake yet?

51:11.088 --> 51:12.648
BRENNER: Tyler...

51:17.288 --> 51:19.608
Your sister was in a car crash.

51:19.728 --> 51:21.608
She flew out the window.

51:21.728 --> 51:23.448
Right.

51:23.608 --> 51:26.968
And she hit the ground
very hard.

51:27.088 --> 51:29.368
And it made her stop breathing,

51:29.488 --> 51:32.728
and...and then,
her heart stopped beating.

51:35.328 --> 51:38.248
We did everything
we could for her, and we...

51:38.248 --> 51:41.128
...we gave her medicine
and oxygen and blood.

51:41.248 --> 51:43.168
But sometimes...

51:44.248 --> 51:48.368
Sometimes people are injured
so bad

51:48.488 --> 51:51.208
that we can't save them.

51:51.368 --> 51:55.488
And that's what happened
to your sister.

51:55.488 --> 51:57.487
We did everything
we could for her...

51:59.047 --> 52:01.007
...but we couldn't help her.

52:03.407 --> 52:05.327
And she died.

52:05.487 --> 52:07.327
Maybe you can
try some more.

52:07.487 --> 52:10.087
Maybe she needs
another operation.

52:12.847 --> 52:15.447
That wouldn't work.

52:15.567 --> 52:17.767
Are you sure?

52:17.887 --> 52:19.887
I'm sorry.

52:23.367 --> 52:26.447
Your mom and dad are going
to come back to town tomorrow.

52:26.567 --> 52:30.487
In the meantime,
we're gonna keep an eye on you.

52:30.607 --> 52:32.767
Can you stay with me now?

52:35.807 --> 52:39.127
I'm not going anywhere.

52:40.207 --> 52:41.447
GRADY: Hey, Dr Brenner,

52:41.607 --> 52:43.127
Alex is going
up to surgery.

52:43.247 --> 52:44.647
Everyone else is tucked in.

52:44.847 --> 52:47.247
OK if we send the interns home
a little early?

52:47.367 --> 52:48.567
Fine by me.

52:48.687 --> 52:49.567
Cool.

52:49.567 --> 52:51.647
I was going to catch some z's
up in the call room.

52:51.647 --> 52:53.967
But I think I'll go home,
see my kids.
Hmm.

52:53.967 --> 52:55.647
RASGOTRA: I thought
this shift would never end.

52:55.807 --> 52:57.447
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

52:58.567 --> 53:01.527
You know... when I was an intern,
after a rough night,

53:01.527 --> 53:04.047
my resident would take us
all out for breakfast.

53:04.207 --> 53:06.287
It's my treat.
What do you say?

53:08.207 --> 53:10.767
I'm pretty sure
everything's closed.

53:10.887 --> 53:12.607
Right.

53:12.727 --> 53:13.927
But thank you, Dr Rasgotra.

53:14.047 --> 53:15.087
Maybe next time.

53:15.207 --> 53:16.247
Yeah.

53:16.367 --> 53:17.407
They all hate me.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.567
You're just their boss.

53:18.727 --> 53:20.487
It's not fun hanging out
with the boss.

53:20.647 --> 53:23.047
Well, if I hurry, I can
pre-round before I sign out.

53:23.207 --> 53:24.287
You did a fantastic job
on the traumas.

53:24.287 --> 53:25.327
Everyone pitched in.

53:25.447 --> 53:26.487
Incredible saves.

53:26.487 --> 53:28.967
I wouldn't want to be
stuck in here all night
with anyone but you.

53:28.967 --> 53:30.287
Oh, that's enough.
No, I'm serious.

53:31.527 --> 53:32.847
And forget
about the deposition.

53:33.007 --> 53:35.846
If the case goes to court,
I'll testify on your behalf.

53:35.966 --> 53:37.046
You'll be golden.

53:37.126 --> 53:38.286
And for what it's worth,

53:38.446 --> 53:40.526
you can ask me out
to breakfast any morning.

53:40.726 --> 53:42.686
Except this morning.
I've got to cover for Banfield.

53:51.926 --> 53:53.886
(SIGHS) Oh!

53:55.126 --> 53:56.726
(SIGHS)

53:56.846 --> 53:59.286
Good night, Dr Banfield.

53:59.406 --> 54:02.246
Good night, Dr Morris.

54:02.366 --> 54:04.326
(SIGHS)

54:06.086 --> 54:08.046
(SIGHS)

54:10.326 --> 54:12.406
Just for the record,

54:12.526 --> 54:15.366
tonight never happened.

54:46.206 --> 54:48.046
GATES: Since Sarah finally
fell asleep,

54:48.206 --> 54:50.126
when Alex goes to surgery,
I'm gonna take her home.

54:50.286 --> 54:52.366
You want me to pick you up
a change of clothes?

54:52.526 --> 54:53.526
Yeah, sure.
OK.

54:53.726 --> 54:56.086
Uh, sorry
about your son.

54:56.206 --> 54:59.046
I was out at the investigation.

54:59.166 --> 55:01.086
He swerved to avoid a minivan

55:01.286 --> 55:02.806
that skidded
through a red light.

55:02.926 --> 55:05.366
Missed 'em completely.

55:05.486 --> 55:07.086
Could have been a lot worse.

55:07.206 --> 55:09.165
Yeah.

55:13.285 --> 55:14.965
(SIGHS)

55:17.485 --> 55:20.125
Ortho wants a couple more
films before they take him up.

55:21.725 --> 55:24.005
Alex, your mom's back.

55:25.165 --> 55:26.365
Did he just open his eyes?

55:26.485 --> 55:27.005
I think so.

55:27.125 --> 55:28.365
Alex?

55:28.485 --> 55:31.005
Hey, over here.

55:31.125 --> 55:34.005
Hi. Hi.

55:34.125 --> 55:35.565
It's OK. It's OK to sleep.

55:35.685 --> 55:37.445
I'm right here, OK?

55:37.445 --> 55:40.205
I got to take these to the lab.

55:52.165 --> 55:54.445
I was really mad. I am...

55:54.605 --> 55:57.365
Those things
that I said, Tony... I...

55:57.525 --> 56:00.965
What I said about Sarah...
I didn't mean that.

56:01.085 --> 56:03.045
OK.

56:04.605 --> 56:05.805
I know you try,

56:05.805 --> 56:07.685
and that we all make mistakes.

56:07.805 --> 56:10.405
It's just...

56:10.525 --> 56:13.285
this is a pretty big mistake.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.085
(SIGHS)

56:16.205 --> 56:19.045
Cos he's everything to me.

56:19.205 --> 56:21.845
And I'm still just trying
to deal with it.

56:21.965 --> 56:23.485
WATER SLOSHES

56:23.605 --> 56:25.685
What the hell?

56:26.885 --> 56:27.925
Oh, God!

56:27.925 --> 56:29.925
Pressure's down. Lost the pulse.

56:29.925 --> 56:31.485
We got to open up his chest.

56:31.605 --> 56:33.085
Oh, God. PEA arrest!

56:33.245 --> 56:35.885
I'll bag him.
Four units packed
cells, four FFP.

56:36.005 --> 56:37.405
Tony...

56:37.525 --> 56:38.925
Two litres gushed out.

56:39.085 --> 56:41.885
Delayed aortic rupture. We need
to get a side clamp on it.

56:53.484 --> 56:54.604
I've got it.

56:57.164 --> 56:58.444
Hold CPR.

56:58.604 --> 57:00.564
Get ready
for internal compressions.

57:00.684 --> 57:01.604
Two units hanging.

57:01.724 --> 57:03.124
Chest incision right now.

57:07.964 --> 57:09.644
Rib spreader, please.

59:19.283 --> 59:20.603
Is that your car?

59:22.123 --> 59:23.843
Is that your car?

59:24.363 --> 59:26.403
Oi! Is that
your car, mate?

59:27.723 --> 59:29.643
Is that your car?

59:29.763 --> 59:32.003
Whoa! Is that
your car?

59:32.683 --> 59:34.323
Is that your car?

59:34.683 --> 59:35.923
Is that
your car?

59:37.243 --> 59:39.683
The new Renault Megane
Coupe and Hatch,

59:39.763 --> 59:41.283
now available with:
