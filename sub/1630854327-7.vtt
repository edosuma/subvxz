Okay.

01:45.657 --> 01:47.521
Hey!
Look who's here!

01:47.521 --> 01:49.695
Hi.
Big last day.

01:49.695 --> 01:51.007
Yeah, we're
trying to forget

01:51.007 --> 01:52.077
all that and act
like everything

01:52.077 --> 01:53.665
- is super normal.
- How are we doing?

01:53.665 --> 01:55.322
Not great.

01:55.322 --> 01:57.117
- How's the new place?
- It is great.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.464
It is weird to live alone
when I don't have Scout,

01:59.464 --> 02:01.742
but I feel
very grown up.

02:01.742 --> 02:04.158
Do you have any surgeries
- I can watch today?
- Zola--

02:04.158 --> 02:05.987
I might have
a very excellent one

02:05.987 --> 02:08.507
with Uncle Winston in O.R. two,
if your mom says it's okay.

02:08.507 --> 02:10.544
Mom, please?

02:10.544 --> 02:12.373
Okay, if anyone asks,
I don't know where you are.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.998
Link!
Hi. Hey.

02:16.998 --> 02:19.518
Do you, uh-- Do you have
- a busy schedule today?
- Actually, no.

02:19.518 --> 02:21.762
I've carved out my whole day
to catch up on charting.

02:21.762 --> 02:24.385
I am buried in--I need you to pick up
a cake by noon.

02:24.385 --> 02:27.077
- This bakery's across town.
- It's for Meredith.

02:27.077 --> 02:28.527
Does she like
faraway cake?

02:28.527 --> 02:30.184
It's her favorite.

02:30.184 --> 02:31.358
It's the triple berry
with the buttercream.

02:31.358 --> 02:32.704
I would do it myself,

02:32.704 --> 02:34.050
but the baby
that I delivered

02:34.050 --> 02:35.569
two weeks ago with
the malformed heart,

02:35.569 --> 02:37.191
he's having
heart surgery today,

02:37.191 --> 02:39.400
and his parents are very
attached to me, and--

02:39.400 --> 02:41.816
and-- and you love me,
so please help.

02:41.816 --> 02:43.370
That is true.

02:45.026 --> 02:46.614
I do love you.
Thank you.

02:50.342 --> 02:53.345
You're all rounding with
Doctors Ndugu and Pierce.

02:53.345 --> 02:55.382
They are breaking new
surgical ground,

02:55.382 --> 02:58.178
and it is a privilege
that they have invited--

02:58.178 --> 02:59.524
Sorry.
My car broke down.

02:59.524 --> 03:01.215
Had to get a ride
with my sister.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.734
Yeah, my car got towed
and it's also my house.

03:02.734 --> 03:04.701
Do you know who else
wasn't punctual?

03:04.701 --> 03:06.462
Taryn Helm
wasn't punctual,

03:06.462 --> 03:08.291
despite being
an excellent surgeon,

03:08.291 --> 03:11.087
and now you can find her
throwing her life away

03:11.087 --> 03:12.813
bartending
across the street.

03:12.813 --> 03:15.367
There's a surgeon
bartending at Joe's?

03:15.367 --> 03:16.713
Why?

03:16.713 --> 03:18.543
Because she burnt out,
that's why.

03:18.543 --> 03:22.823
So, hydrate and sleep
and lean on your friends,

03:22.823 --> 03:26.033
and take a break
and get a good therapist.

03:26.033 --> 03:27.931
And be on time,

03:27.931 --> 03:29.588
unless you
want to wind up like Helm,

03:29.588 --> 03:31.107
wasting your talents,

03:31.107 --> 03:33.178
your family's investment,
and your futures.

03:33.178 --> 03:34.973

shade behind her back?

03:41.876 --> 03:44.120
<i>Dr. Earl Joseph to L</i>

03:46.778 --> 03:48.262
Meadow, Will.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.815
Um, we're
a teaching hospital,

03:49.815 --> 03:51.196
and these
are our first years.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.473
Is it okay
if they stay?

03:52.473 --> 03:53.819
You can say no.

03:53.819 --> 03:55.545
Uh, i-it should be okay.

03:55.545 --> 03:57.202
Baby?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.761
Dr. Kwan.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.697
Arlo Fischer, delivered by
Dr. Wilson two weeks ago,

04:09.697 --> 04:12.528
and diagnosed with
truncus arteriosus and VSD.

04:12.528 --> 04:14.875
He's been listed for
a transplant for heart failure,

04:14.875 --> 04:17.291
and he was placed
on ECMO a week ago.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.983
Arlo's deterioration is
sending him into organ failure.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.365
We got a call from UNOS last
night that there is a match,

04:22.365 --> 04:24.471
but the procurement team reported

04:24.471 --> 04:26.576
that the donor heart muscle
is weak

04:26.576 --> 04:28.682
and not suitable
for transplantation.

04:28.682 --> 04:30.200
But Dr. Pierce
and I believe

04:30.200 --> 04:31.581
that we can still
make use of the heart

04:31.581 --> 04:33.825
if we transplant only
the two major arteries.

04:33.825 --> 04:35.205
So, it's a partial
heart transplant?

04:35.205 --> 04:36.759
Has that ever
been done before?

04:36.759 --> 04:39.209
No, this
will be the first.

04:39.209 --> 04:41.419
I don't understand.

04:41.419 --> 04:43.041
Why can't we just wait
on another heart?

04:43.041 --> 04:45.802
Meadow, it could take months
to find another match.

04:45.802 --> 04:47.977
Arlo cannot stay on ECMO
for that long.

04:47.977 --> 04:50.186
Baby, she's saying partial
is better than nothing.

04:50.186 --> 04:52.188
We know this is frightening,
but if this works,

04:52.188 --> 04:54.535
these valves will grow with him
for the rest of his life,

04:54.535 --> 04:56.226
and he won't need
a heart transplant

04:56.226 --> 04:58.090
or any other
additional surgeries.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.577
<i>If</i> this works.
What if it doesn't work?

05:01.577 --> 05:04.234
He dies?
My baby dies?

05:05.926 --> 05:08.998
We're gonna give you
some time to think about it.

05:08.998 --> 05:10.655
We really do believe
that this is

05:10.655 --> 05:12.898
Arlo's best option
at this point.

05:18.076 --> 05:19.629
Can you...
I can stay.

05:19.629 --> 05:21.079
Yes, Of course.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.183
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Yeah.

05:32.849 --> 05:34.023
Come in.

05:37.889 --> 05:39.200
Hey.
Hi.

05:40.478 --> 05:42.134
Heard it's your
last day.
It is.

05:43.895 --> 05:45.206
Thanks for coming.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.208
I went by the house.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.831
It's nice to see
it's still standing.

05:48.831 --> 05:51.040
There's a giant hole
where the attic used to be.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.214
They've spent the last two weeks
stabilizing the place,

05:53.214 --> 05:55.216
but everything
still reeks of smoke.

05:55.216 --> 05:57.357
It's...
How are the kids?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.462
Zola's excited to start
at her new school.

05:59.462 --> 06:02.016
I think Bailey and Ellis
are sad to leave.

06:02.016 --> 06:03.328
I called, you know?

06:03.328 --> 06:04.433
I know.

06:05.675 --> 06:07.539
This has been a lot.

06:07.539 --> 06:11.163
A fire,
living in a hotel, moving.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.924
No, I know it's been a lot,
but what-- what was your plan?

06:12.924 --> 06:14.339
You were just gonna leave
and not call me back?

06:14.339 --> 06:15.651
And you're gonna move
across the country

06:15.651 --> 06:16.928
without a conversation?

06:16.928 --> 06:19.379
I-I-I-I don't get that.
I don't.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.690
I didn't know
what to say.

06:20.690 --> 06:22.071
I moved here
to be with you.

06:22.071 --> 06:23.279
Yes, I took a job,
but I moved here

06:23.279 --> 06:25.246
to be with you.

06:25.246 --> 06:27.283
You didn't say it back.

06:28.698 --> 06:29.975
I didn't
say what back?

06:29.975 --> 06:31.874
You s--

06:31.874 --> 06:33.876
What?

06:33.876 --> 06:35.325
I said, "I love you."

06:35.325 --> 06:37.327
You were standing
exactly in that spot

06:37.327 --> 06:38.639
where you are
right now.

06:38.639 --> 06:39.916
I said, "I love you."

06:39.916 --> 06:41.504
You didn't say it back.

06:41.504 --> 06:44.507
You had just taken a job
at my hospital.

06:44.507 --> 06:46.647
I thought--
I had hoped

06:46.647 --> 06:48.373
that we were
gonna pick it up

06:48.373 --> 06:50.375
right where we left off.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.342
But you seemed to want
to take it slow.

06:52.342 --> 06:55.173
So, it did not
occur to me

06:55.173 --> 06:57.624
to confer with you
about me moving.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.246
Okay, so wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, whoa.

06:59.246 --> 07:00.868
This--
So, this is on me?

07:00.868 --> 07:02.180
This whole thing,
it's my fault?

07:02.180 --> 07:03.492
That is not
what I just said.

07:03.492 --> 07:05.528
I-I didn't do and say
exactly what you thought

07:05.528 --> 07:07.496
I should do and say
on exactly your timeline,

07:07.496 --> 07:09.567
so this whole mess
is my fault.

07:09.567 --> 07:11.016
That's what
you're saying?
That is not
what I said.

07:11.016 --> 07:12.811
No, no. Nope.

07:12.811 --> 07:15.193
I can't.

07:31.554 --> 07:33.556
So essentially, we will
take out the truncus

07:33.556 --> 07:35.144
and the malformed artery,

07:35.144 --> 07:36.973
replace it with the donor
aorta and pulmonary trunk,

07:36.973 --> 07:39.389
and then use their walls
to close the VSD.

07:39.389 --> 07:40.701
So it's like gutting
the inside of a house

07:40.701 --> 07:42.185
without
disturbing the frames.

07:42.185 --> 07:43.566
Can you not use the word
"gutting" when talking

07:43.566 --> 07:44.705
about a tiny baby heart?

07:44.705 --> 07:46.569
Mm, cosign.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.157
I don't like the verbiage,
but it is a pretty apt metaphor.

07:48.157 --> 07:49.986
Do we
get to scrub in?

07:49.986 --> 07:52.195
There will only be room
for one of you at the table.

07:52.195 --> 07:54.370
We are operating on a heart
the size of a strawberry.

07:54.370 --> 07:56.406
The vessels are
half a centimeter wide.

07:56.406 --> 07:58.167
My hands
are the smallest!

07:58.167 --> 07:59.858
You will not be stitching.
You will be observing.

07:59.858 --> 08:02.689
But whoever does the best
vascular anastomosis

08:02.689 --> 08:05.381
in the skills lab
wins the spot.

08:06.865 --> 08:08.177
Dr. Kwan.

08:08.177 --> 08:09.627
Yeah?

08:09.627 --> 08:11.387
Uh, don't do your finger
agility exercises

08:11.387 --> 08:12.906
in front of the patients, alright?

08:12.906 --> 08:14.908
Oh, it's a technique
I use to disengage

08:14.908 --> 08:16.081
from the emotionality.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.326
To stay neutral.

08:19.326 --> 08:20.638
Y-You know, when--
when the mother

08:20.638 --> 08:22.363
started crying,
I was...

08:22.363 --> 08:24.642
It's smart. You just can't
let them see it, Kwan.

08:24.642 --> 08:26.229
Understood.

08:30.268 --> 08:31.511
Richard!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.064
Just curious
how it's going.

08:33.064 --> 08:34.583
The search
for the new chief.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.377
It was easy
a few years ago

08:36.377 --> 08:38.138
when we were
at the top of our game. Right.

08:38.138 --> 08:39.967
But we've got a lot
of interesting applicants

08:39.967 --> 08:41.555
we're sorting through, yeah.

08:41.555 --> 08:43.902
I mean, Grey-Sloan
is not an easy place

08:43.902 --> 08:45.663
just to step right into.

08:45.663 --> 08:47.975
It's got its own history,
its-- its own quirks,

08:47.975 --> 08:49.252
its own personality.

08:49.252 --> 08:50.909
Well, that it does.

08:50.909 --> 08:54.188
Yeah. I mean, it-- it wouldn't
be the-- the worst idea

08:54.188 --> 08:55.845
to look closer to home.

08:55.845 --> 08:57.226
Someone who's been here,

08:57.226 --> 08:59.504
who-- who understands
our history,

08:59.504 --> 09:02.818
the issues, and-- and our past
and our needs.

09:02.818 --> 09:06.097
Altman, I think
you're onto something.

09:06.097 --> 09:08.375
T-There's no
extra pay involved,

09:08.375 --> 09:09.514
but there's lots
of free pastries

09:09.514 --> 09:11.378
and we could use
your expertise.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.863
I-I'm sorry,
there's no extra pay?

09:13.863 --> 09:15.520
No, the search committee
is voluntary.

09:15.520 --> 09:17.073
But we'd love to have you.

09:17.073 --> 09:18.903
We're meeting in the second
floor conference room

09:18.903 --> 09:21.491
from 4:00 to 6:00
on Monday.

09:21.491 --> 09:23.183
Okay, got it.
Thank you.

09:23.183 --> 09:24.529
I will...

09:24.529 --> 09:26.013
join.
Great.

09:26.013 --> 09:27.083
Yeah.
Thank you.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.360
Okay.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.641
Meadow, I got a page.
Is everything okay?

09:32.641 --> 09:34.125
I can't do it.

09:35.195 --> 09:37.887
I-I can't
kiss him goodbye

09:37.887 --> 09:39.751
for what
might be forever.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.201
She wants to wait.

09:42.443 --> 09:45.585
W-We want to wait
for a whole heart.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.311
An infant donor heart
could take up to six months

09:48.311 --> 09:49.347
to find a match.

09:49.347 --> 09:50.659
But we got this one.

09:50.659 --> 09:52.143
This one was a match
and it came in days.

09:52.143 --> 09:54.386
- But it was damaged.
- I know.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.561
But we could get
another match

09:56.561 --> 09:58.080
in the next
couple of days.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.978
It could happen.

09:59.978 --> 10:02.602
I know that it's hard,
and I know that it's scary,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.570
but Dr. Pierce
is as good as it gets

10:05.570 --> 10:07.365
and she is not
a risk taker.

10:07.365 --> 10:09.574
She doesn't do
experimental surgeries

10:09.574 --> 10:11.507
for practice or for glory.

10:11.507 --> 10:13.992
She is suggesting this
because she believes

10:13.992 --> 10:15.373
that she can
save Arlo's life.

10:19.998 --> 10:23.484
I don't know
how to love my son this much

10:23.484 --> 10:25.728
and send him in
for an experimental surgery

10:25.728 --> 10:27.212
that might kill him.

10:29.387 --> 10:30.906
I-I can't do it.

10:33.598 --> 10:35.324
If he dies
in that surgery,

10:35.324 --> 10:38.327
I won't ever
be okay again.

10:38.327 --> 10:40.398
Tell Dr. Pierce
thank you, but no.

10:40.398 --> 10:42.331
The surgery is off.

11:04.594 --> 11:06.666
Ow! Damn it.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.668
You know what?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.048
Screw this.

11:12.844 --> 11:14.674
What? Should I
go after her?
Shh.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.399
Some of us
are trying to win.

11:16.399 --> 11:18.229
I hate this stitch.

11:18.229 --> 11:21.439
Oh, you have to kinda twirl
your wrist like, um...

11:21.439 --> 11:22.716
Here.

11:24.753 --> 11:26.582
Right.

11:26.582 --> 11:28.170
Yeah.

11:30.828 --> 11:32.381
- Oh, no.
- It's Tessa Hobbes.

11:32.381 --> 11:33.727
Who?

11:33.727 --> 11:35.177
I have no idea.

11:36.557 --> 11:37.697
Done.

11:39.008 --> 11:40.216
Tessa.
What happened?

11:40.216 --> 11:41.562
I'm so sorry.

11:41.562 --> 11:43.219
She came in with severe
abdominal pain.

11:43.219 --> 11:46.050
She's a bit hypotensive.
Take her to CT.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.052
I-I picked up
my groceries.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.054
Tessa, we said no heavy
lifting, three months.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.365
It was just
a grocery bag,

11:51.365 --> 11:54.265
and I was feeling so great.

11:54.265 --> 11:56.025
And then there
was this sharp pain,

11:56.025 --> 11:57.475
like something tore.

11:57.475 --> 11:58.821
And then she drove
herself here.

11:58.821 --> 12:00.029
Wh-- You
drove yourself?

12:00.029 --> 12:01.134
Well, in retrospect,
I can see

12:01.134 --> 12:02.514
that might have been
a bad idea.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.344
Tessa, which area
hurts exactly?

12:04.344 --> 12:06.208
All of it.
The entire abdomen hurts.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.312
Here--
touch right there.

12:07.312 --> 12:08.762
- Ow!
- She's tachycardic.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.074
We should take her
straight to the O.R.

12:10.074 --> 12:11.523
No, her blood pressure's
holding.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.870
Get her to CT first
and then call the O.R.

12:12.870 --> 12:14.216
to be on standby.

12:14.216 --> 12:15.735
Skip the line.
I'll call ahead.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.184
I really think we
should just take her

12:17.184 --> 12:18.427
straight to the O.R.Go! I'll call Marsh.

12:18.427 --> 12:19.566
Someone page Chief Grey!

12:25.986 --> 12:28.161
♪ Hey, love

12:28.161 --> 12:32.027
- Are you Dr. Hellum?
- Who's asking?

12:32.027 --> 12:34.374
Mika Yasuda, first year
surgical resident.

12:34.374 --> 12:36.238
It's Helm, and I'm
no longer a doctor.

12:36.238 --> 12:37.653
Cool, 'cause
I'm barely a doctor

12:37.653 --> 12:38.930
and I'm desperate
for a win.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.347
Could you
possibly teach me

12:42.347 --> 12:44.902
how to do a perfect
microvascular anastomosis?

12:44.902 --> 12:47.042
There's a contest and if I win
I get to scrub in

12:47.042 --> 12:48.975
on a partial heart transplant
on a newborn.

12:48.975 --> 12:50.700
A partial heart transplant
doesn't exist.

12:50.700 --> 12:54.083
I know, but it is about to,
and I-I need this.

12:55.119 --> 12:57.155
I need a win
because I, uh--

12:57.155 --> 12:58.363
I don't have anywhere
to sleep tonight,

12:58.363 --> 13:00.780
and Seattle is
outrageously expensive,

13:00.780 --> 13:04.576
and being a surgical
resident is exhausting...

13:04.576 --> 13:06.647
...to the point
of nearly impossible,

13:06.647 --> 13:09.374
and I just really need to give
myself a reason to keep caring.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.585
And if Blue wins,
I cannot take the gloating.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.242
Blue?
Like the ribbon.

13:15.242 --> 13:16.968
And this is a nickname
he perpetuates.

13:16.968 --> 13:18.556
Wow.
That is arrogant.

13:18.556 --> 13:19.937
Right?

13:21.593 --> 13:23.526
20 bucks.

13:23.526 --> 13:25.977
My house was towed this morning,
so I don't have 20 bucks.

13:25.977 --> 13:27.496
But if I win
this contest,

13:27.496 --> 13:28.842
I will barback for you
on Friday night for free.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.188
You've been a barback?

13:30.188 --> 13:31.362
No, but I've been
a cater waiter

13:31.362 --> 13:32.846
and I'm excellent
at chopping limes.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.576
Give me it.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.374
<i>♪ I love you far</i>

13:43.374 --> 13:45.410
<i>♪ You know I'm never right</i>

13:47.688 --> 13:51.209
I was treating myself
to champagne and fruit salad

13:51.209 --> 13:53.591
because that's what
I was craving,

13:53.591 --> 13:56.076
and I had plenty
to celebrate.

13:56.076 --> 13:57.802
Now, okay, wait, wait.

13:59.390 --> 14:01.392
And then
the groceries came.

14:01.392 --> 14:03.394
They left them
on the front stoop.

14:03.394 --> 14:05.085
It didn't even o-occur to me

14:05.085 --> 14:07.260
not to bend over
and pick them up.

14:07.260 --> 14:08.778
It's routine.

14:08.778 --> 14:11.816
It's muscle memory.

14:11.816 --> 14:14.508
Dr. Griffith, the ring
around your necklace--

14:14.508 --> 14:15.889
are you engaged?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.477
I-I was.
I was engaged.

14:17.477 --> 14:19.065
Now I'm not.

14:20.031 --> 14:22.033
Heartbreak is the worst.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.724
It is.

14:23.724 --> 14:25.692
If I die today, I might
even miss heartbreak.

14:25.692 --> 14:26.900
Please try
not to die today.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.660
Yeah, I'll do my best.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.524
Oh, wait.
I need my purse.

14:30.524 --> 14:32.147
- Right now?
- Yes, where is it?

14:32.147 --> 14:33.182
Uh, it's downstairs
with your clothes.

14:33.182 --> 14:34.494
I can get it
after we're done here.

14:34.494 --> 14:36.082
Okay.

14:36.082 --> 14:37.911
Hey, what happened?

14:37.911 --> 14:40.017
Schmitt said her abdomen
is distended and she's tachy.

14:40.017 --> 14:41.604
She's getting more hypotensive.

14:41.604 --> 14:43.710
Okay, well, you two
need to go book an O.R.

14:43.710 --> 14:45.574
I don't care if you have to
kick someone out to do it.

14:45.574 --> 14:47.472
Tessa takes priority.

14:47.472 --> 14:49.992
I don't get it.

14:49.992 --> 14:51.511
She did this
for groceries?

14:51.511 --> 14:53.685
Well, I don't think she
did it on purpose, Nick.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.240
I think she probably lives alone
and is set in her ways,

14:56.240 --> 14:58.759
and I'm sure it's a lot for her
to change and ask for help.

14:58.759 --> 15:00.485
Hello?

15:00.485 --> 15:02.763
We're here, Tessa.
Please stay very still.

15:02.763 --> 15:05.559
I'm afraid.
This is all wrong.

15:05.559 --> 15:06.940
I-I don't want to die.

15:08.355 --> 15:10.254
I still have
something to say.

15:10.254 --> 15:11.980
Tessa, you're not
going anywhere today.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.188
We've got you.

15:13.188 --> 15:14.568
She's bleeding out.

15:14.568 --> 15:16.467
We're gonna need
some help in here.

15:16.467 --> 15:18.745
We're gonna need
blood in the O.R.

15:18.745 --> 15:20.712
Tessa, we're gonna
take you upstairs.

15:22.024 --> 15:23.577
So on a scale
of one to better?

15:23.577 --> 15:25.752
We're better. I think.
I think we're better.

15:25.752 --> 15:28.134
But you're not sure?

15:28.134 --> 15:30.377
I am sure that we
are both excited

15:30.377 --> 15:32.932
about this partial heart
transplant on an infant,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.554
which is a
stroke-of-genius idea

15:34.554 --> 15:36.211
that we came up
with together.

15:36.211 --> 15:39.214
And that is because in the
O.R., we're good together.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.595
In our chosen field of study,
we are so good.

15:41.595 --> 15:43.080
Are you rehearsing
a speech you plan on

15:43.080 --> 15:44.702
- giving him later?
- Maybe a little.

15:44.702 --> 15:46.773
So the two of you haven't
really spoken since the fire.

15:46.773 --> 15:48.740
Oh, we said some things.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.328
We needed
a cooling-off period.

15:50.328 --> 15:52.537
It's best that we haven't
talked about it.

15:52.537 --> 15:55.747
A-And, you know,
we'll talk again soon.

15:55.747 --> 15:58.129
As soon as we change
medical history.

15:58.129 --> 16:00.338
I have bad news.

16:00.338 --> 16:01.305
Oh, no.
The baby?

16:01.305 --> 16:02.858
No, he's stable.

16:02.858 --> 16:04.342
But his mom's too scared.

16:04.342 --> 16:06.034
She wants to call it off.

16:06.034 --> 16:08.381
I can't talk her into it.
That would be unethical.

16:08.381 --> 16:10.659
But you think she's got
this one wrong?

16:10.659 --> 16:13.696
Without this surgery,
the baby has days to live.

16:13.696 --> 16:16.216
She had a 30-hour labor
and she did it without any meds.

16:16.216 --> 16:18.011
- Meaning?
- She's a warrior.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.426
She's strong
in her convictions,

16:19.426 --> 16:21.428
and she seems sure
of what she wants.

16:22.843 --> 16:24.328
Let me talk to her.

16:24.328 --> 16:25.639
You can't.

16:25.639 --> 16:26.778
I'm not her doctor.

16:28.194 --> 16:29.264
Let me talk to her.

16:31.714 --> 16:34.407
You're a neurosurgeon,
so do you think Arlo needs--

16:34.407 --> 16:35.891
No, no, no. No.

16:35.891 --> 16:37.651
No, I'm not here as one
of Arlo's doctors.

16:37.651 --> 16:40.206
I'm sorry, but if you're here
to try to talk me into--

16:40.206 --> 16:42.173
I'm here
because I had a baby

16:42.173 --> 16:45.038
who only lived
for 43 minutes.

16:45.038 --> 16:47.075
He had a condition
called anencephaly,

16:47.075 --> 16:50.595
which is when the baby's brain
does not develop typically,

16:50.595 --> 16:54.392
and, uh, we discovered it
when I was 6 months pregnant.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.222
We didn't know.

16:56.222 --> 16:57.533
We didn't know
until he was born

16:57.533 --> 16:59.052
that there
was anything wrong.

16:59.052 --> 17:00.329
I gave birth
to Christopher

17:00.329 --> 17:02.228
knowing that he would be
an organ donor,

17:02.228 --> 17:04.230
uh, because there was nothing
that we could do.

17:04.230 --> 17:07.302
There was no surgery
that we could try.

17:07.302 --> 17:11.754
And, um, I think about
him a lot these days

17:11.754 --> 17:16.069
because he has
a brother now, named Scout,

17:16.069 --> 17:17.553
and as Scout grows up,

17:17.553 --> 17:19.176
I cannot help
but think about

17:19.176 --> 17:20.694
who Christopher
would have been.

17:21.695 --> 17:24.560
And, um...

17:24.560 --> 17:28.047
what I do know is

17:28.047 --> 17:30.911
if there
had been a chance

17:30.911 --> 17:32.189
that Christopher
could have lived,

17:32.189 --> 17:34.053
if there had been
any hope,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.331
if there had been
any surgery

17:36.331 --> 17:40.473
and it meant
that he might live...

17:40.473 --> 17:42.164
I would take the shot.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.183
I knew it.

18:01.183 --> 18:02.702
I knew we should have taken
her straight to the O.R.

18:02.702 --> 18:03.806
We needed the CT to see
if we could operate--

18:03.806 --> 18:06.154
My gut doesn't lie.

18:06.154 --> 18:07.845
And I should have
fought for it.

18:07.845 --> 18:09.743
We should have brought
her straight here.

18:15.128 --> 18:16.647
Yeah,
I'm number one.

18:16.647 --> 18:18.062
Ew, someone
likes himself.

18:18.062 --> 18:21.030
No, my sample
is literally number one.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.825
But yes,
I intend to win.

18:22.825 --> 18:25.414
What is that face?
Is that good?

18:25.414 --> 18:27.209
It is if you want
to go home early.

18:27.209 --> 18:28.831
I knew I shouldn't have
practiced on bananas.

18:28.831 --> 18:31.386
What about fruit says
"baby veins" to you?

18:31.386 --> 18:33.146
This is all good work.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.769
Number one's sutures
are particularly precise.

18:38.427 --> 18:41.154
But with perfect
alignment and tension,

18:41.154 --> 18:43.639
the winner
is number three.

18:43.639 --> 18:45.745
That's me!

18:45.745 --> 18:49.024
Guess we gotta call you
Red today, huh?

18:49.024 --> 18:50.198
Hm.

19:16.051 --> 19:17.570
Scalpel.

19:28.097 --> 19:30.099
I thought
you would win.

19:30.099 --> 19:32.067
Your stitches
are typically excellent.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.379
I know.

19:33.379 --> 19:35.415
Better than Yasuda's.

19:35.415 --> 19:37.176
I tanked the contest

19:37.176 --> 19:39.523
because babies scare
the crap out of me.

19:39.523 --> 19:41.214
Didn't want to be
anywhere near that table.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.767
Why are you
scared of babies?

19:44.079 --> 19:45.218
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.219
You gotta tell me.
Come on.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.670
Okay, but you
owe me one.

19:48.670 --> 19:49.705
Owe you what?

19:49.705 --> 19:50.982
Whatever I decide.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.398
Fine.

19:54.262 --> 19:57.644
When I was 5,
my dad took me into the backyard

19:57.644 --> 20:02.097
where my mom had just
given birth to my brother

20:02.097 --> 20:03.685
in a kiddie pool.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.240
Now, you've done
an OB rotation.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.105
You're acquainted with all
the blood and placenta

20:10.105 --> 20:12.901
and the literal horror movie
that is human child birth.

20:12.901 --> 20:15.283
And I'm sure it's all
very beautiful in its own way,

20:15.283 --> 20:17.008
but I was 5.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.252
And before I could fully
process what I was seeing,

20:19.252 --> 20:21.461
my dad handed me
a pair of scissors

20:21.461 --> 20:23.636
and told me to cut
the umbilical cord.

20:23.636 --> 20:24.878
Wait, you were 5?

20:24.878 --> 20:26.225
Yeah.

20:28.572 --> 20:30.677
What, you think
this is funny?

20:30.677 --> 20:32.921

20:40.308 --> 20:42.102

25:24.074 --> 25:26.525
She exclusively calls me
by my mother's name now,

25:26.525 --> 25:27.905
which I can handle.
I didn't know my mother.

25:27.905 --> 25:30.252
But my sister,
she remembers my mother,

25:30.252 --> 25:31.668
she remembers
that I killed her.

25:31.668 --> 25:34.429
She was 6
when it happened and...

25:34.429 --> 25:37.225
she's never
forgiven me for it.

25:37.225 --> 25:39.054
And every time
my grandmother calls me

25:39.054 --> 25:41.229

she hates me more,

25:41.229 --> 25:43.024

telling you this, Chief Grey.

she felt her pain,

the first thing she did

26:04.908 --> 26:06.150
is go to her computer

were doing designer drugs

in high school.

sparkling cider.
