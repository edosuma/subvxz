00:00.355 --> 00:02.754
You want to win so much,
there's a shortcut.

00:02.755 --> 00:04.043
He's slipping!

00:04.555 --> 00:07.359
Not everything out here
is easily explained.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.103
That's it! Wormholes.

00:09.104 --> 00:13.127
We're the matter slipping between
infinite variations of the same reality.

00:13.176 --> 00:17.137
You boys have a demon after you.
A bona fide, hell-bent on murder demon.

00:17.964 --> 00:21.677
- You think my grandma tried to kill you?
- I think the demon was controlling her.

00:21.678 --> 00:23.910
Did you boys
get these consent forms?

00:23.911 --> 00:28.265
It's an excursion to the Bremin Ranges.
Maybe we can find our own way home.

Season 1, Episode 9

01:13.873 --> 01:16.873
Synced by Stubbie & Reef
www.addic7ed.com

01:25.410 --> 01:29.044
Good morning, bushwalkers.
Ready to leave your comfort zones?

01:29.068 --> 01:30.450
Andy, you made it.

01:30.451 --> 01:33.433
Hand me your permission slips
before you get on the bus.

01:33.434 --> 01:34.794
Thank you, Andy.

01:34.941 --> 01:38.404
Although I don't like
the look of those clouds.

01:40.219 --> 01:43.059
- What do you think, Andy?
- It's just a little rain.

01:43.079 --> 01:48.902
A storm is best observed from behind
a window, Andy, not hiking in a forest.

01:48.903 --> 01:51.762
The forecast is
for isolated showers clearing.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.387
Alright.
Let's do it.

01:56.388 --> 01:57.546
Yes!

02:13.325 --> 02:15.203
It's all my fault.

02:15.890 --> 02:18.952
- What's your fault?
- Us being here.

02:19.554 --> 02:21.890
How exactly is that <i>your</i> fault?

02:24.247 --> 02:28.632
Mr Bates was gonna cancel the school
excursion because of the storm, but...

02:28.806 --> 02:32.288
- I told him it was clearing.
- So you gave Bates a weather update?

02:32.292 --> 02:34.572
I convinced him to go
with a lie.

02:35.092 --> 02:38.558
Because of me, we got lost
and we ended up here.

02:39.107 --> 02:43.938
Look, Andy, I was trying to win
an imaginary race.

02:43.939 --> 02:46.779
Felix lost the map,
Sam fell down a cliff.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.076
Who knows
whose fault it was?

02:49.478 --> 02:52.573
It was mine.
And I need to fix it.

02:52.746 --> 02:57.566
If you really think this is our only
chance to get home, then today's the day.

02:58.055 --> 02:59.783
Stupid rock!

03:00.552 --> 03:05.589
And... keep the confessions to yourself.
It's not gonna make anyone feel better.

03:05.931 --> 03:08.521
No breakfast,
again.

03:09.194 --> 03:11.706
- I'm starving.
- Mostly blue sky.

03:11.707 --> 03:13.798
The excursion
should go ahead this time.

03:13.799 --> 03:16.938
- So what's the plan?
- Retrace our steps...?

03:17.021 --> 03:18.742
And get lost again?

03:19.322 --> 03:22.601
No, we find the valley
and the wormhole.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.402
And how exactly does this work?

03:24.403 --> 03:26.815
In this universe,
the excursion was delayed.

03:26.816 --> 03:30.261
What if the wormhole was delayed
as well? We could find it again.

03:30.262 --> 03:32.881
And you have trouble
believing in magic?

03:32.882 --> 03:34.282
It's worth a shot, dude.

03:34.283 --> 03:36.626
We're supposed to be at Phoebe's
this morning, remember?

03:36.627 --> 03:39.162
Where we have to magically locate
a missing person?

03:39.163 --> 03:41.903
- And you think <i>my</i> plan has problems.
- Come on, Sam.

03:41.904 --> 03:43.389
I thought you believed in magic.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.511
And, Jake, you saw what happened
with the dogs.

03:45.512 --> 03:48.646
Andy's right. I mean,
it's a bit of a long shot.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.097
Magic or science...
Which path do we take?

03:52.098 --> 03:53.762
OK, let's vote.

03:53.991 --> 03:55.475
Andy's solution?

03:57.405 --> 04:00.795
- Sam...
- Sorry, dude. It kinda makes sense.

04:00.796 --> 04:03.014
Alright. Let's go
wormhole hunting.

04:10.793 --> 04:13.234
Phoebe's gonna be
really angry with us.

04:13.535 --> 04:16.375
Phoebe! We need
her signature.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.623
What are you doing?

04:22.246 --> 04:23.842
But that's forgery.

04:23.843 --> 04:25.723
Bates wouldn't even know
Phoebe's surname.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.740
Haven't you ever
faked a signature?

04:27.741 --> 04:30.207
- No.
- Our fearless leader...

04:33.964 --> 04:35.280
Mum.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.262
I'll never
get used to that.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.096
Ellen!

05:00.609 --> 05:02.649
I recognise that stare.

05:02.826 --> 05:03.994
"Mega-death."

05:03.995 --> 05:07.155
She asked me to meet her yesterday
but I got detoured.

05:07.156 --> 05:08.516
You stood her up?

05:09.042 --> 05:12.771
There is no known universe where Ellen
forgives someone for standing her up.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.843
I guess I just have to face
the music.

05:15.844 --> 05:18.733
- Is that what Bear Grylls would do?
- I'll help, dude.

05:18.734 --> 05:23.236
Women are like puzzles
and I am the great un-puzzler.

05:25.168 --> 05:26.648
Hey!

05:31.495 --> 05:32.755
Great.

05:32.952 --> 05:34.448
Excited about
the bushwalk?

05:34.449 --> 05:37.032
- Yeah, it should be fun.
- We love nature.

05:38.397 --> 05:42.590
- Hey, maybe we could walk together.
- Yeah. Maybe.

05:43.365 --> 05:44.947
Or maybe not.

05:46.197 --> 05:49.589
- Oh, and Andy wanted to say something.
- About yesterday...

05:49.590 --> 05:52.373
I only waited for
a small insect's lifespan.

05:52.463 --> 05:54.703
He really is sorry
about standing Ellen up.

05:54.808 --> 05:56.943
- You, I mean...
- I know who I am.

05:56.944 --> 05:59.468
He was just overwhelmed
by your awesomeness.

05:59.469 --> 06:00.829
- I was...?
- Well, tell him

06:00.832 --> 06:03.136
I was overwhelmed
by his rudeness.

06:03.137 --> 06:05.686
Mia! You coming?

06:06.287 --> 06:07.664
Better go.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.150
Bye, Mia.

06:11.536 --> 06:15.374
Have you considered psychiatric
help? Because you are a nut job.

06:16.317 --> 06:17.797
And you're a jerk.

06:20.410 --> 06:22.337
But Jake ate
poisoned pickles.

06:22.363 --> 06:24.451
Poisoned pickles?
Really?

06:24.630 --> 06:27.813
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- Thanks for letting me know.

06:29.724 --> 06:33.852
He struck out. Why do I find that
strangely satisfying?

06:33.853 --> 06:35.653
And you say I'm competitive.

06:35.773 --> 06:37.253
Hey, Jake!

06:38.726 --> 06:40.246
You should join the team.

06:41.989 --> 06:43.991
There's training after school
tomorrow.

06:45.284 --> 06:47.284
Maybe this reality isn't so bad.

06:47.343 --> 06:50.183
Except we're living in a shed
and we're always hungry and...

06:50.249 --> 06:52.394
Oh, yeah, there's a demon
tryin' to kill us.

06:52.395 --> 06:56.878
But here, my brother can walk.
And my family actually like me.

06:57.395 --> 06:59.535
Don't you want
to go home, Felix?

07:04.093 --> 07:07.878
OK, take your seats, ladies and gents.
Nature waits for no-one.

07:09.498 --> 07:12.864
OK, give me your wrist, Sammy,
and close your eyes.

07:15.537 --> 07:18.091
- A bracelet?
- An anniversary gift.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.885
- Thanks, babe.
- Do you like it?

07:19.974 --> 07:21.654
Sure. Thanks.

07:23.177 --> 07:26.137
It's so bizarre.
It's like watching my evil twin.

07:26.256 --> 07:28.989
Well, I guess this universe can be
pretty confusing.

07:29.017 --> 07:31.163
Which is why I can't wait
to get home.

07:31.164 --> 07:35.318
Haven't you ever thought,
what if this <i>is</i> home?

07:35.373 --> 07:38.053
Dude, seriously?

07:39.701 --> 07:42.901
- Didn't go so great with Ellen?
- She hates me.

07:42.952 --> 07:45.721
- You never had a chance.
- Why?

07:45.722 --> 07:50.581
Because even under that terrible
dress sense, there is a very cool girl.

07:50.909 --> 07:52.941
Come on,
try and get it!

07:52.942 --> 07:55.920
- Hey! Hey, give it back!
- Get off!

07:56.499 --> 07:58.869
- Trent, Dylan, behave.
- No! Stop it!

07:58.870 --> 08:00.932
- Hey, Jake, over here.
- Over here.

08:03.130 --> 08:04.346
You OK?

08:04.347 --> 08:08.166
Alrighty, listen up. Welcome
to the Year Ten Science Excursion

08:08.167 --> 08:09.903
which is quite literally
a walk in the park -

08:09.904 --> 08:11.878
the Bremin Ranges
National Park.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.315
The pattern's repeating.

08:40.812 --> 08:44.091
Felix, I know we haven't seen
eye to eye lately,

08:44.293 --> 08:46.450
but you know Ellen
better than anyone.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.052
So... What would
you do?

08:49.053 --> 08:51.936
If I were you?
Give up.

08:52.697 --> 08:54.679
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

08:55.088 --> 08:58.088
I'd tell her the truth.
Just be honest with her.

08:58.093 --> 09:00.692
- In front of all her friends?
- Absolutely.

09:00.693 --> 09:04.133
There's nothing cooler than a public
declaration of your feelings.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.771
Good advice.

09:10.169 --> 09:12.044
You are evil.

09:12.596 --> 09:14.284
But hilarious.

09:14.326 --> 09:15.577
Hey.

09:16.057 --> 09:17.392
What now, Andy?

09:17.425 --> 09:20.411
Ellen, I've never had
a girlfriend before and...

09:20.461 --> 09:22.492
- Are you crazy?
- Jake was sick.

09:22.493 --> 09:26.396
That bit is true but the other truth
is was that I was afraid to meet you.

09:26.397 --> 09:28.843
Let's talk over here.
Quietly.

09:31.232 --> 09:34.129
I was afraid I wouldn't know
what to do or say.

09:34.689 --> 09:36.373
Kind of like now.

09:37.996 --> 09:41.386
By the way, did I just do
something totally humiliating?

09:41.729 --> 09:45.452
Yes, but you did it
in a totally cute way.

09:45.911 --> 09:47.813
Wow, that's lucky.

09:47.973 --> 09:50.447
- Forgive me?
- Forgiven.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.869
Alright, Year Tens,
listen up.

09:55.220 --> 09:59.080
Form groups
as I call out your names.

09:59.979 --> 10:01.298
We have to stick together.

10:01.299 --> 10:05.116
Mike, Sam,
Tammy and Trent.

10:05.117 --> 10:08.125
- Bummer.
- They can't put Mike with that meathead.

10:08.486 --> 10:10.742
Focus. That's not
why we're here.

10:10.743 --> 10:13.805
Andy, Dylan, Christian and Cassie.

10:13.806 --> 10:18.428
Ah, Sammy, Michelle,
John, Ellen.

10:18.453 --> 10:20.120
Boring.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.978
- See you after the walk.
- Yeah, see ya.

10:23.245 --> 10:25.203
- Ellen?
- Daniel, Alexis...

10:25.204 --> 10:28.244
- Just in case I don't see you...
- You're gonna hitchhike home?

10:28.245 --> 10:30.459
No, but if I don't return...

10:30.460 --> 10:34.356
<i>...Which leaves Shirley,
Madeline and Ryan.</i>

10:35.431 --> 10:39.431
<i>If I've already called your names,
can you please get into your groups?</i>

10:40.673 --> 10:43.473
<i>- Come on, now, get organised.</i>
- This way.

10:43.493 --> 10:46.172
Just hop into your groups there,
new boys.

10:46.173 --> 10:48.188
The other Year Tens won't bite,
I hope.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.749
But if they do, they've all
had their shots so...

10:50.750 --> 10:52.110
Go! Run!

10:53.214 --> 10:57.361
Stop there! I won't
tell you again! Stop!

10:57.362 --> 11:00.502
Why do I always fall for bad boys?

11:09.765 --> 11:11.423
- Awesome!
- Excellent.

11:11.424 --> 11:13.835
Did you see the look
on Bates' face?

11:14.562 --> 11:16.226
I remember this place.

11:16.548 --> 11:19.268
Oh, yeah, this is where
Jake emptied out your backpack.

11:19.269 --> 11:21.870
- What is this?
- Chicken's feet, obviously.

11:22.253 --> 11:26.094
Yeah, I was a bonehead back then and
I officially wanna say I'm sorry, Andy.

11:26.258 --> 11:28.543
- And Felix.
- I was a bonehead too.

11:28.544 --> 11:31.553
- Less than him, though.
- We've all changed.

11:31.554 --> 11:34.434
I was a nerd, but...
No longer.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.733
A sudden storm.

11:41.248 --> 11:44.801
Like the last time.
A confluence of repeating events.

11:44.853 --> 11:46.213
Still a nerd.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.551
We went that way,
I remember.

11:48.577 --> 11:49.791
Let's go.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.213
Stay together.

12:25.109 --> 12:27.013
Home, here we come.

12:28.483 --> 12:31.283
This has been the worst
experience of my life.

12:31.442 --> 12:33.652
- I guess so.
- Come on, man.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.180
You mean you don't hate it here?

12:35.181 --> 12:36.587
- Most of it.
- What!?

12:36.588 --> 12:39.956
If I had to break it down,
60 to 70% - hate it,

12:39.957 --> 12:43.882
17% - over-stimulated mainly
because a girl likes me

12:43.883 --> 12:46.803
and 13 to 20% -
kinda fun.

12:46.804 --> 12:49.587
In my world, my mum works
two jobs just to pay the rent.

12:49.588 --> 12:51.200
I don't wanna drag her
back into that.

12:51.201 --> 12:53.867
Technically, Jake,
she still exists in both places.

12:53.868 --> 12:56.963
Well, my brothers here hate me
and my parents have replaced me,

12:56.964 --> 12:59.564
so I 110%
want to go home.

12:59.589 --> 13:00.837
Come on.

13:16.997 --> 13:20.313
- This is where we went over.
- I suppose we have to do the same again.

13:20.314 --> 13:23.827
- If we want to be scientific.
- I don't remember it being this high.

13:23.853 --> 13:26.684
- Come on. We've done it before...
- Accidentally.

13:26.685 --> 13:28.662
Yeah, but you're a man
of action now, right?

13:28.663 --> 13:32.150
Yes. But there's action
and then there's pure stupidity.

13:32.151 --> 13:33.504
Let's do it.

13:35.584 --> 13:37.722
Just psyching
myself up.

13:39.207 --> 13:40.714
Not fair!

13:46.974 --> 13:49.903
- What's up?
- We can't be separated.

13:59.328 --> 14:01.769
- Nice landing.
- What happened?

14:01.770 --> 14:04.490
Every time we separate,
the talisman stops working.

14:04.491 --> 14:08.168
- Have you checked the batteries?
- Ha-ha. I don't get you.

14:08.170 --> 14:11.313
You believe in wormholes and every
hare-brained scientific theory

14:11.314 --> 14:12.862
ever invented,
but not magic.

14:12.863 --> 14:14.263
Quantum physics can be proven.

14:14.264 --> 14:16.989
What if magic's just science
that hasn't been explained yet?

14:18.604 --> 14:22.126
Felix, where to now, huh?
You were the map guy.

14:22.127 --> 14:23.956
You said you knew the way, right?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.736
- This is where I lost the map.
- And we went around in circles.

14:26.737 --> 14:28.172
- Pretty much.
- Great.

14:29.557 --> 14:31.488
You wrote down directions
in your diary?

14:31.489 --> 14:33.320
I write lots of things.

14:35.410 --> 14:38.610
The storm's gathering force.
Just like last time.

14:38.770 --> 14:42.238
- I vote we head towards it.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.250
What does a wormhole
actually look like?

14:51.410 --> 14:54.184
A geometric tunnel
that cuts through space and time.

14:55.469 --> 14:57.069
Can't see one of those.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.526
But I see
one of those things again.

15:04.709 --> 15:07.669
Maybe it has something to do
with Phoebe's sister.

15:09.610 --> 15:13.814
- See, Andy? A sign of magic.
- More like arts and crafts class.

15:13.815 --> 15:16.644
You are going to be so embarrassed
when I prove magic is real.

15:16.645 --> 15:19.427
- I am not!
- Will you two just shut up...

15:19.921 --> 15:22.852
Eyes on the prize, guys.
Eyes on the prize. Come on.

15:42.890 --> 15:44.450
Hurry, storm's coming!

15:44.610 --> 15:48.403
- This place looks really familiar.
- Yeah, I remember it too.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.659
Isn't that where we...

15:52.783 --> 15:56.181
- Spent the night? Yeah.
- Come on, let's go.

15:57.976 --> 15:59.186
Come on.

16:01.609 --> 16:05.943
- We're going home!
- Yes! Finally!

16:14.990 --> 16:16.210
Are you OK?

16:16.211 --> 16:18.607
- Get us out! Andy, come on!
- Get us out of here!

16:18.608 --> 16:20.882
- Guys, the talisman.
- Take it easy!

16:20.883 --> 16:23.530
Ow! Stop,
you're making it worse!

16:23.699 --> 16:26.939
- Guys, I can't find it.
- Andy, get this thing off us!

16:28.632 --> 16:29.988
Help us out of here.

16:30.304 --> 16:31.984
- Wait.
- Now, dude!

16:32.090 --> 16:34.023
Get us out of here!

16:34.700 --> 16:36.685
- Something's coming.
- Andy!

16:36.726 --> 16:38.488
- What?
- I don't know!

16:38.489 --> 16:40.169
Don't just stand there,
come on!

16:45.600 --> 16:47.650
It's Roland, remember?

16:47.731 --> 16:50.820
- What are you boys doing back here?
- We're trapped, obviously!

16:50.821 --> 16:54.249
Not the desired outcome
but a success, nonetheless.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.730
Can you get us out?

16:56.178 --> 16:58.738
Get on the other end
of that net, kid.

17:01.725 --> 17:03.125
Hey, guys?

17:03.565 --> 17:05.165
I'm soaked!

17:05.786 --> 17:07.829
What a stupid place for a net
to be placed.

17:07.830 --> 17:10.355
So, Roland, why'd you decide
to live in the forest?

17:10.356 --> 17:12.640
Well, the thing is...

17:16.002 --> 17:18.155
- Stop playing around.
- Roland...?

17:19.405 --> 17:21.246
- What the...?
- What is it?

17:21.247 --> 17:22.865
Roland, are you alright?

17:25.290 --> 17:26.770
Get us out!

17:28.859 --> 17:31.148
- Roland, what's happening?
- Let us go!

17:31.519 --> 17:32.918
He's a psycho!

17:32.970 --> 17:35.636
Where's the talisman?
Andy, help me look!

17:38.866 --> 17:41.226
Andy, we need
the talisman now!

17:43.210 --> 17:45.731
- Felix! Andy!
- Oh, no!

17:47.943 --> 17:49.783
Andy, find the talisman!

17:53.498 --> 17:54.600
Hey!

17:57.266 --> 18:01.602
- Andy, get out! We'll take him!
- Guys, get out of here! Leave me!

18:01.873 --> 18:04.092
No, we're not
going anywhere.

18:05.356 --> 18:06.709
Look out!

18:09.194 --> 18:12.341
- Get out of here!
- Andy! Help us!

18:12.699 --> 18:14.029
Felix, run!

18:14.030 --> 18:16.270
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

18:16.271 --> 18:19.041
Earth, Water, Air, Fire.

18:19.303 --> 18:23.322
- Extreme lethal cage fight.
- Go! Come on, Andy!

18:28.474 --> 18:30.474
Andy, where's the talisman?

18:35.051 --> 18:39.149
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee.

18:40.185 --> 18:44.088
Earth... Water...

18:45.813 --> 18:47.213
Come on!

18:54.556 --> 18:56.436
Felix, say it now!

18:56.589 --> 18:59.310
Divinity of the Elements,
I summon Thee!

18:59.838 --> 19:02.955
Earth... Water...

19:03.531 --> 19:04.844
Air...

19:05.368 --> 19:06.776
Fire.

19:08.455 --> 19:14.824
Earth. Water. Air. Fire.

19:28.526 --> 19:31.478
OK, magic totally exists.

19:32.941 --> 19:34.741
- What happened?
- You were possessed.

19:34.742 --> 19:36.982
- What do you mean?
- You were crazy, dude!

19:37.121 --> 19:40.062
No, I-I can't remember.

19:40.291 --> 19:42.670
- What happened to him?
- You happened to him.

19:42.729 --> 19:44.936
- I'm OK.
- I warned you, boys.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.991
This place is dangerous.

19:46.992 --> 19:50.959
I can't... I can't stay here.
I can't stay in this place.

19:51.021 --> 19:54.263
That's cool with us. But we need
to start a fire, like last time.

19:54.264 --> 19:56.420
- You boys can't stay here either.
- Says who?

19:56.421 --> 19:58.004
We were planning
on staying the night.

19:58.005 --> 20:01.554
Are you insane?
This place is malevolent.

20:02.139 --> 20:05.157
Strange stuff happens here.
I know it.

20:05.296 --> 20:08.136
- Well, we're not leaving.
- You may not have a choice.

20:16.026 --> 20:18.805
- What'd he mean by that?
- Who cares?

20:21.274 --> 20:24.813
What about you, brainy dude?
Demon slayer!

20:24.814 --> 20:28.105
Felix, I was wrong,
and I apologise.

20:28.259 --> 20:31.659
Magic exists.
I've seen it with my own eyes.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.980
Hallelujah. At last.

20:36.221 --> 20:39.612
Like you said,
we haven't always gotten on.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.173
- Mainly because you're so...
- Intelligent?

20:42.301 --> 20:45.060
Yeah, intelligent.

20:45.421 --> 20:48.782
- But thanks for saving me, Andy.
- It was this thing.

20:49.860 --> 20:52.180
Is this the only thing
that can protect us?

20:52.181 --> 20:53.541
So far.

20:54.251 --> 20:57.691
But the demon seems to get more
powerful each time it manifests.

20:58.304 --> 21:00.771
You know, there's still time
to make the bus.

21:00.772 --> 21:02.707
Are you kidding me?
After all that?

21:02.708 --> 21:06.606
Maybe it's not too late to see Phoebe.
Andy, you've seen magic.

21:06.607 --> 21:09.539
- That's why we're here. Not wormholes.
- We had a deal.

21:09.540 --> 21:12.100
To spend a miserable night
in an evil forest?

21:12.109 --> 21:14.944
- It's not going to get us home.
- He may have a point, Sam.

21:14.945 --> 21:17.706
The existence of magic
is definitely a game changer.

21:18.943 --> 21:21.315
No way. I'm not giving up.

21:31.538 --> 21:36.488
- Come on, Sam. Maybe Felix is right.
- You go, then. I'm staying.

21:36.489 --> 21:39.464
- That's even more pointless.
- Do you guys even want to go home?

21:39.465 --> 21:42.305
- Sam, we all do.
- Well, it didn't sound like it.

21:44.364 --> 21:47.239
OK, Sam,
I'll stay with you.

21:48.644 --> 21:50.847
Alright, I guess I will too.

21:54.644 --> 21:56.044
Alright, then.

21:58.893 --> 22:01.044
- What was that?
- Is the demon back?

22:01.053 --> 22:03.163
Worse, it's Bates.

22:05.028 --> 22:07.348
Just what do you think
you're doing?

22:07.349 --> 22:10.547
- Man, no!
- Roland! What a traitor!

22:10.548 --> 22:13.213
You've got my nulla-nulla.
I need it.

22:15.113 --> 22:19.059
You boys are in very serious trouble.
You've ruined the excursion for everyone.

22:19.060 --> 22:23.759
I have exhausted students on the bus back
there, while you sit here and do what?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.413
- Make camp?
- Just leave us here.

22:25.439 --> 22:28.015
Well, that's not gonna happen.
On your feet now.

22:46.268 --> 22:49.782
And I wanna see the four of you
tomorrow before class.

22:51.778 --> 22:53.258
Andy.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.733
Beautiful goal!

23:05.760 --> 23:09.400
And Bremin takes the flag
once again.

23:11.740 --> 23:15.363
You do that again and I'll bounce
that thing off your head. Got it?

23:16.674 --> 23:19.041
Oh, and about
the football...?

23:20.060 --> 23:21.662
Not interested.

23:33.205 --> 23:37.231
An altar and a tree with the same
spiral pattern as the restoring demon.

23:37.232 --> 23:39.102
Maybe
it was left by Phoebe's sister.

23:39.103 --> 23:42.772
Who disappeared in the same forest.
Is there a link between her and us?

23:42.773 --> 23:45.456
That's why I need to get
her Book of Shadows, see if there is.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.648
Magic is a whole new mindset.
New rules, new...

24:06.092 --> 24:07.503
Police! Open up!

24:07.519 --> 24:08.892
That's my dad again.

24:09.151 --> 24:10.683
No sign of them.

24:10.709 --> 24:11.919
Look out!

24:13.199 --> 24:15.199
They're definitely
staying here, Sarge.

24:15.282 --> 24:17.842
- Want me to check the bush?
- No, I will.

24:17.977 --> 24:20.300
Oi! Boys!

24:21.105 --> 24:22.252
Jake!

24:22.253 --> 24:23.653
Let's get out of here.

24:23.773 --> 24:26.333
Come on, we know
you're out there!

24:33.239 --> 24:34.839
Sam.

24:35.663 --> 24:38.226
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

24:42.196 --> 24:46.957
<i>They don't understand what
you're going through, but I do.</i>

24:47.193 --> 24:49.383
<i>Let me help you.</i>

24:53.333 --> 24:54.566
Sam...

24:55.613 --> 24:57.078
Come on.

24:57.555 --> 24:59.031
Come on!

25:10.086 --> 25:13.305
Your behaviour has indicated that you
don't want to be part of this community.

25:13.306 --> 25:15.070
Really, we do wanna be
part of this world.

25:15.071 --> 25:17.671
- Not all of us.
- I beg your pardon...?

25:17.672 --> 25:19.871
Magic is governed by
a strict set of principles.

25:19.872 --> 25:21.947
So then what's the cause?

25:21.977 --> 25:24.217
Destroy the talisman
and go back home.

25:25.802 --> 25:28.592
- Mind if I try it on?
- Sam, don't!

25:32.638 --> 25:35.743
Well, if I blitz this thing,
we all go back to our real lives.

25:35.744 --> 25:38.916
- The talisman's protecting us, Sam.
- You'll see.
