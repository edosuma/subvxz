WEBVTT

00:13.833 --> 00:16.041
[Erin] Thank you
for getting me in before school.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.416
Do we see her today?

00:19.166 --> 00:22.000
[Sarah] Oh, it's a her?
I thought you didn't wanna know.

00:22.083 --> 00:24.500
[Erin] I don't. I just want you
to accidentally tell me.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.416
Can you do that? Don't do that.

00:27.458 --> 00:29.250
[Sarah] We are just listening today.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.250
How are you feeling overall?

00:33.291 --> 00:38.458
Overwhelmed. Um, but otherwise,
you know, mostly excited.

00:38.541 --> 00:42.083
I'm excited to get huge
and slip into that elastic waistband,

00:42.166 --> 00:44.833
and eat everything,
and be comfortable all the time.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.333
I'm not gonna be
comfortable at all, am I? [chuckles]

00:50.166 --> 00:53.375
I keep waiting for all those weird
cravings everyone keeps talking about,

00:53.458 --> 00:56.291
but so far it's just
cottage cheese and grapes.

00:56.375 --> 00:58.500
And Lucky Charms right out of the box.

01:00.541 --> 01:01.583
Everything good?

01:02.541 --> 01:04.958
You know, maybe we will
take a look today after all.

01:06.250 --> 01:08.916
Is that okay? I thought we weren't
supposed to use that too much.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.583
It's okay today. How has movement been?

01:12.666 --> 01:14.041
Lots of fluttering, kicking?

01:14.125 --> 01:20.083
Um, yeah, like a butterfly
with little feet. "Not-So-Littlefoot."

01:20.916 --> 01:22.833
Any difference in the last 24 to 48 hours?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.875
I don't think so. I mean, even yesterday…

01:26.958 --> 01:28.625
[ultrasound machine gurgles]

01:30.541 --> 01:31.958
I think I want to know the sex.

01:33.666 --> 01:36.291
You can go ahead and tell me.
You can tell me. Just go ahead.

01:37.125 --> 01:39.375
[Sarah] Have you had any cramps? Bleeding?

01:39.458 --> 01:40.458
No.

01:45.833 --> 01:48.041
Where's the heartbeat?
We're supposed to hear the heartbeat.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.583
-Here, let me see. What do you see?
-Erin.

01:50.666 --> 01:51.625
Nothing.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.958
[hesitating] I mean it. I see nothing.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.375
I mean, there's nothing here.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.500
I don't… I don't understand.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.875
There's nothing in your uterus.

02:09.291 --> 02:12.166
I don't… I don't understand.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.375
In early weeks, people sometimes
miscarry without realizing it,

02:15.458 --> 02:18.000
but as far along as you are,
you would have…

02:18.083 --> 02:20.458
It would have been noticeable,
very noticeable.

02:21.333 --> 02:22.166
Miscarry?

02:22.250 --> 02:24.041
And you wouldn't
have been the first person

02:24.125 --> 02:26.958
to go through something like this
and maybe block it out, Erin?

02:27.041 --> 02:28.625
But there's nothing…

02:29.791 --> 02:33.458
-I'm just incredibly sorry. I'm so sorry.
-No, I didn't miscarry.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.125
There's not much I can do.

02:37.208 --> 02:40.458
We can run a blood panel
and send it to the lab,

02:41.541 --> 02:43.625
but it seems you have miscarried.

02:44.208 --> 02:46.041
-You must have miscarried.
-I didn't.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.708
Where's my baby?

02:50.083 --> 02:52.916
I'm gonna put you in touch
with a colleague on the mainland.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.416
She's a great counselor.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.750
Where's my baby?

03:26.250 --> 03:27.291
[door opens]

03:29.625 --> 03:30.625
How is he?

03:32.375 --> 03:33.333
Not sure.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.291
It's incredible, isn't it?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.291
I mean, I'd seen old photos
for years and years,

03:40.375 --> 03:44.291
and still it didn't even cross my mind
the first time I saw him this way.

03:44.375 --> 03:45.458
It didn't even click.

03:46.083 --> 03:47.875
I suppose context is everything.

03:47.958 --> 03:51.500
It's amazing how the scales fall
from our eyes, isn't it?

03:52.041 --> 03:54.250
Did Dolly and Wade finally head home?

03:54.333 --> 03:55.458
[Joe] Mmm-hmm.

03:55.541 --> 03:58.500
Good. They need sleep. We all need sleep.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.333
Day's just startin'.

04:00.958 --> 04:04.666
How's he doing?
Does he have a fever? Is he eating?

04:06.458 --> 04:10.916
I didn't… Well, I didn't get too close.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.916
None of us did.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.458
All three of us, we, um…

04:15.416 --> 04:17.791
we were a little scared shitless,
truth be told.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.458
Scared?

04:25.083 --> 04:26.416
[knocking at door]

04:26.500 --> 04:28.416
Father? Oh!

04:29.250 --> 04:33.000
[laughing] Good Lord!
Why is it so dark in here?

04:33.666 --> 04:36.416
-Look at you, up and about.
-[Father Paul] Mmm.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.458
Looks like God heard my prayers.
I was worried sick about you.

04:39.541 --> 04:42.541
Oh! Sorry. It just hurts my eyes.

04:42.625 --> 04:43.500
Oh.

04:44.375 --> 04:45.333
That's all right.

04:46.666 --> 04:48.375
-You had quite the night.
-Yeah.

04:48.458 --> 04:49.958
Quite the night.

04:50.041 --> 04:55.250
Here. I made you the chicken ginger soup
my mother used to make me when I was sick.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.291
That is very kind. I'm starving.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.833
I don't remember
ever being this hungry before.

05:02.416 --> 05:03.500
It makes sense.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.750
Always starving after a long trip,
and you had quite the journey.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.500
[chuckles] That's for sure.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.041
Precious few have taken the road you took.

05:13.125 --> 05:13.958
[Father Paul] Mmm.

05:14.041 --> 05:17.291
Widow of Nain's son,
Jairus' daughter, Lazarus.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.791
Jesus Christ himself
took three days to walk that road,

05:21.875 --> 05:23.625
and you didn't have three minutes.

05:24.416 --> 05:26.875
-You canceled mass?
-I did.

05:26.958 --> 05:30.708
Sturge is waiting at the church to explain
to people if they miss the sign.

05:31.958 --> 05:33.666
But you're already looking better,

05:33.750 --> 05:36.833
so I imagine you'll be ready
by tomorrow if you eat up.

05:37.916 --> 05:39.416
But you have to eat up.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.750
I will. Just not right now.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.625
Maybe, uh, a quick checkup.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.333
-I could call Dr. Gunning--
-No.

05:56.416 --> 05:59.583
That's not necessary, ah, just yet.
I feel…

06:00.541 --> 06:06.250
I feel everything that is happening here
is a matter of faith, not science,

06:06.333 --> 06:10.041
so I don't want
to cloud this area with any doubt.

06:11.666 --> 06:14.458
You've always been
a woman of great faith, Bev.

06:16.791 --> 06:20.291
I've always tried.
I am blessed you noticed.

06:21.083 --> 06:23.708
I wanna, um, confide something in you.

06:24.791 --> 06:25.666
[grunts]

06:38.916 --> 06:39.833
Something…

06:42.083 --> 06:45.250
is happening, shifting inside of me.

06:47.291 --> 06:48.833
I remember when I was younger,

06:50.291 --> 06:55.291
I experienced times
of great spiritual growth.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.750
But that was just…

06:58.833 --> 07:01.291
It's nothing like this.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.625
It's like I can feel God…

07:06.250 --> 07:08.250
-move inside me.
-[Bev exhales]

07:10.083 --> 07:11.333
[softly] That's wonderful.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.958
I think I should be left alone

07:23.125 --> 07:24.375
for the rest of the day.

07:25.583 --> 07:26.416
To pray.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.375
[Bev] Mmm.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.541
Dolly and Wade are good people.

07:51.458 --> 07:52.791
They can keep a secret.

07:53.875 --> 07:58.291
Sturge is gonna answer the call,
be a good apostle to you.

07:58.375 --> 08:00.250
He just needs some guidance.

08:00.333 --> 08:03.208
We can keep this quiet for a moment.

08:05.458 --> 08:06.666
But, Monsignor…

08:09.041 --> 08:10.208
we should show 'em.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.916
Tell them who you are.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.083
Don't hide your light under a bushel.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.291
That's one of the parables,

08:18.375 --> 08:22.916
and it was important enough that
Matthew, Mark and Luke all wrote it down.

08:23.916 --> 08:25.916
We'll do what you ask, of course.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.208
And if you don't think they're ready,
well, that's okay.

08:29.916 --> 08:32.958
Jesus revealed himself slowly
after the resurrection,

08:33.041 --> 08:37.166
but what a wonderful revelation it will be

08:37.250 --> 08:42.791
to know their own dear Monsignor Pruitt
was restored by an angel of God.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.000
Think about it.

08:45.708 --> 08:46.666
It will be.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.458
In God's time.

08:52.291 --> 08:53.958
There's no other kind, is there?

08:55.833 --> 08:57.083
[door closes]

09:02.500 --> 09:03.416
[grunts]

09:12.208 --> 09:13.750
[breathes deeply]

09:38.375 --> 09:39.833
[Ed] Thanks for helping out this morning.

09:39.916 --> 09:42.250
[Riley] Yeah. I'm starting to think
you don't really need help.

09:42.333 --> 09:44.208
Your back, and you're right as rain.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.291
[Ed sighs] Maybe.

09:46.375 --> 09:48.416
That why you told Warren
he could take the day off?

09:49.333 --> 09:50.916
No, not really.

09:53.083 --> 09:56.208
I thought maybe we could talk, just us,

09:56.916 --> 09:58.000
man-to-man.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.291
Oh. Uh…

10:02.916 --> 10:03.833
Okay.

10:04.875 --> 10:07.083
[Ed] I made a confession few days ago,

10:07.625 --> 10:12.583
and Father, well, he encouraged me
to talk about a few things with you.

10:14.125 --> 10:15.583
So here goes, I guess.

10:17.416 --> 10:21.166
I guess I've harbored
some resentment for you.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.250
Okay?

10:27.041 --> 10:29.166
And I chalked it up
to just normal friction.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.958
I didn't take it personal when,

10:31.875 --> 10:35.000
you know, you acted like
all this was beneath you.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.291
No, it wasn't that.

10:36.375 --> 10:38.750
Well, you acted like it anyway.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.166
And then you were gone.

10:42.541 --> 10:45.791
Hell, I didn't even know what
to tell people it was that you were doin'.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.791
What the hell do I know
about starters and what have you?

10:48.875 --> 10:49.791
Start-up.

10:50.958 --> 10:52.666
I guess I resented that too.

10:53.833 --> 10:58.291
Like it weren't worth it for you to
explain to your dumb old blue-collar dad

10:58.375 --> 11:00.291
exactly what it was
you were doin' out there.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.708
I tried to explain it to you,
but I didn't get very far.

11:02.791 --> 11:04.291
You said you didn't care
about the Internet,

11:04.375 --> 11:05.916
or about tech or anything else that--

11:06.000 --> 11:07.458
Look. The point is…

11:09.625 --> 11:11.750
I already had resentment in my heart.

11:12.791 --> 11:14.000
And I shouldn't have.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.291
I shouldn't have.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.208
But then all the rest happened.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.708
And, man, I resented that.

11:28.541 --> 11:31.916
Not just the embarrassment of it all,
or the stigma of it all.

11:34.125 --> 11:37.250
But the money
we had to spend on your legal fees.

11:38.583 --> 11:42.916
The cost of you living
here with us now. A grown man.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.208
Gee, I'm really glad
we're havin' this talk.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.375
[Ed] Let me finish.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.833
I know I should be grateful.

11:49.916 --> 11:53.375
I… I should be grateful
that my son is home and free.

11:53.458 --> 11:56.208
Lord knows your mother
is grateful every day.

11:58.333 --> 12:02.666
Children just don't do
what you did on their own,

12:02.750 --> 12:06.291
not unless one of their parents
has failed them somethin' awful.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.458
And your mother's a saint,
so I guess that just leaves me.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.875
So I apologize, son.

12:14.416 --> 12:15.875
For whatever I did.

12:22.291 --> 12:23.333
I love you.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.583
I really do.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.916
It's just, somehow it's hard for me…

12:34.083 --> 12:36.500
It's hard for me
to show that when you're here.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.291
So I apologize. That's all.

12:44.541 --> 12:45.708
[clicks tongue]

12:45.791 --> 12:46.791
[exhales]

12:46.875 --> 12:48.125
We should head back.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.458
Before it gets too late.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.375
What are you up to?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.500
[Sarah] Mom. You're up again.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.708
Felt like a walk.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.958
-Let's do it again.
-[Mildred] Okay.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.791
What chores did you have to do growing up?

13:23.875 --> 13:29.833
I, uh, kept the house clean
and I always did the dishes.

13:29.916 --> 13:32.500
When you were a teenager,
what did you and your friends do for fun?

13:32.583 --> 13:34.875
Not much to do in the Crock Pot.

13:35.583 --> 13:36.958
Still isn't, I suppose.

13:38.541 --> 13:43.541
But Uppards for booze and boys.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.000
What was my dad's name?

13:47.541 --> 13:48.416
Mom?

13:48.500 --> 13:51.625
Uh, your father's name was George.

13:51.708 --> 13:52.833
What did he do?

13:53.500 --> 13:57.583
He was a fisherman,
and then he joined the Navy.

13:57.666 --> 13:58.750
And how did you meet?

13:59.416 --> 14:02.250
Oh, we met at a dance on the mainland.

14:02.333 --> 14:03.291
And who am I?

14:05.333 --> 14:06.833
You are my world.

14:07.666 --> 14:09.125
My heart and soul.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.791
My daughter, Sarah.

14:12.875 --> 14:13.791
The doctor.

14:15.583 --> 14:19.875
Would you like a cup of tea?
I'm going to make some tea.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.458
[sizzling]

14:39.125 --> 14:40.208
[tube shatters]

14:51.208 --> 14:53.916
Been meaning to
pack up her things since I got back.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.166
I just couldn't start for whatever reason.

14:59.791 --> 15:02.583
Weeks became months,
and it was never really a priority.

15:02.666 --> 15:06.166
And then today I get through
two rooms and half the attic.

15:07.791 --> 15:09.291
Whatever you have to do.

15:14.875 --> 15:15.875
[sighs]

15:17.833 --> 15:20.666
A lot of people cross-stitch Bible verses.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.166
But my mom…

15:24.208 --> 15:29.041
My mom goes with the passage
from Lamentations.

15:31.125 --> 15:32.875
It's a special kind of self-pity

15:32.958 --> 15:35.375
to identify with
the destruction of Jerusalem.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.500
We kept birds when I was a kid.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.708
Doves.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.125
My mom spent weeks, weeks,

15:51.208 --> 15:54.500
building this ridiculous coop
outside our kitchen window.

15:55.625 --> 15:57.666
Ordered pet doves from the mainland.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.916
When they finally got here,

16:00.000 --> 16:03.041
the first thing she wanted to do
was clip their wings.

16:05.791 --> 16:08.833
When she called me over,
her seven-year-old daughter,

16:10.958 --> 16:14.291
she told me I had
to hold them while she did it.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.958
I asked her why she did it
and she said, "So they wouldn't fly away."

16:20.625 --> 16:22.000
And she told me… Now get this.

16:22.083 --> 16:25.583
Again, this is her
seven-year-old daughter she's talking to.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.333
She said,

16:28.875 --> 16:31.291
"Everyone gets
their wings clipped at some point."

16:32.625 --> 16:34.708
And I asked the next question.

16:34.791 --> 16:38.500
It's the only question a kid's gonna ask
when they hear something like that.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.833
I said, "Mom,
did you get your wings clipped?"

16:43.416 --> 16:45.416
And she said, "Yep. Oh, yes."

16:46.041 --> 16:47.041
"Day you were born."

16:50.125 --> 16:51.291
"Day you were born."

16:55.041 --> 16:58.833
She's holding those clippers,
and I have this bird in my hand.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.083
And it's cooing in my palm
and it feels like a cat purring.

17:04.166 --> 17:06.000
And it trusted me.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.875
And something came over me
and I let it go.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.708
And then she hit me.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.000
Her behavior would change.

17:22.291 --> 17:26.583
Drinking, yelling, hitting,
something more nuanced,

17:26.666 --> 17:31.125
something passive-aggressive,
but the message behind it was clear.

17:33.541 --> 17:35.041
I ruined her life.

17:37.791 --> 17:38.833
But Littlefoot?

17:40.833 --> 17:43.708
You see, that baby saved mine.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.916
Because I did it.
I did what I said I was gonna do.

17:49.000 --> 17:52.166
I ran away at 16.
I was gonna be an actress.

17:52.250 --> 17:55.541
I was gonna be a star.
And I traveled, and I lived.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.500
And by the time I woke up
and the drugs had worn off,

17:58.583 --> 18:01.083
I looked up and I had married my mother.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.708
At first he was clingy,
and then he was mean.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.791
And then he was drunk all the time.

18:06.875 --> 18:10.166
And then he hit me.
And I knew that posture. I knew it.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.666
I would have stayed with him.

18:13.541 --> 18:15.833
[sniffles] I would have died
in that house.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.625
But I woke up one day
and I felt different, I felt sick.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.083
And so I took a test.

18:26.291 --> 18:31.083
And I saw that little plus sign,
and I stared and I stared and I stared.

18:32.500 --> 18:36.208
And I packed my bags.
And I never looked back.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.000
[sobs] She saved me.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.291
And now she's just gone.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.625
And how is that possible?

18:46.250 --> 18:47.791
How is that possible?

18:50.750 --> 18:52.291
I have this, um…

18:55.166 --> 18:56.000
dream.

18:58.041 --> 19:01.041
This recurring dream,
I've had it since I was inside.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.625
I'm floating out in the middle of the bay.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.791
Middle of the water. Just gray water.

19:07.875 --> 19:09.041
Morning water.

19:09.125 --> 19:12.666
The sky lightening
as the sun's about to rise.

19:13.458 --> 19:16.916
And if I could just point the bow,

19:18.291 --> 19:21.916
find a wind or an oar,
paddle with my goddamn hands if I had to,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.208
to a different shore.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.208
Start a new life.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.708
That dream always ends with the sunrise.

19:30.791 --> 19:32.041
Always.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.666
I never get further than that sunrise.

19:37.041 --> 19:39.666
That part I can see,
clear as day. That part is…

19:41.791 --> 19:45.875
That part is real, but the rest,
whatever life I'm supposed to have after?

19:45.958 --> 19:47.291
That I can't see.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.333
And the more I have that dream,

19:50.416 --> 19:53.750
the more I just know
that it's not in the cards for me.

19:56.750 --> 19:58.416
I'm not getting off this island.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.083
I know it.

20:01.791 --> 20:04.708
Late at night,
no matter what I might let myself hope…

20:04.791 --> 20:05.625
[sniffles]

20:06.416 --> 20:08.666
or what I might tell my mom or my dad.

20:10.625 --> 20:11.708
I know it.

20:13.291 --> 20:14.458
But you…

20:17.500 --> 20:18.625
You can do anything.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.083
You always could do anything.

20:24.458 --> 20:25.541
Pray with me?

20:29.208 --> 20:30.208
[sniffles]

20:32.666 --> 20:33.666
Yes.

20:35.666 --> 20:36.791
Please, God.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.708
Help me to understand.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.541
Mercy.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.125
Please have mercy on us.

20:54.375 --> 20:58.041
Our sorrow is too much. It's too much.

21:01.000 --> 21:01.875
Mercy.

21:07.958 --> 21:10.458
Our Father, who art in Heaven…

21:10.541 --> 21:12.125
[both] Hallowed be Thy name.

21:12.208 --> 21:16.916
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

21:17.458 --> 21:20.125
[Father Paul] Give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us our trespasses

21:20.208 --> 21:22.541
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

21:22.625 --> 21:25.500
And lead us not into temptation, but…

21:27.916 --> 21:28.791
[groans]

21:34.666 --> 21:36.708
[breathes deeply]

21:36.791 --> 21:38.625
Deliver us from evil. Amen.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.958
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord be with you, blessed art thou…

21:45.125 --> 21:46.083
[grunts]

21:52.916 --> 21:54.375
[breathing heavily]

22:02.666 --> 22:03.625
[grunts]

22:15.000 --> 22:15.958
[licks]

22:28.750 --> 22:29.750
[groans]

22:34.625 --> 22:35.625
[sucks]

22:54.583 --> 22:55.625
Blessed art thou.

22:56.791 --> 22:59.208
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

23:03.125 --> 23:04.708
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

23:06.583 --> 23:08.000
pray for us sinners, now…

23:08.083 --> 23:10.916
And at the hours of our deaths. Amen.

23:15.958 --> 23:17.208
[exclaims]

23:17.291 --> 23:18.416
Fuck. Fuck.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.166
Whoa. Come on. Come on, come on.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.041
Hey, Joe.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.083
Sheriff. How are you today?

23:26.166 --> 23:27.166
I'm okay.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.041
Day's young, though.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.083
How's my night gonna be, Joe?

23:32.750 --> 23:34.791
Well, shit, how should I know?

23:37.041 --> 23:38.000
You okay?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.666
I'm workin' on it, man.

23:40.666 --> 23:43.000
[hesitating] I'm workin' on it.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.166
[breathing heavily] Fuck you.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.291
[bell chimes]

24:01.000 --> 24:03.083
[chanting prayer indistinctly]

24:13.166 --> 24:14.833
Ever this day, be at my side,

24:16.500 --> 24:17.791
to light and guard,

24:19.291 --> 24:20.541
to rule and guide.

24:21.375 --> 24:24.666
Angel of God, my guardian dear,

24:25.250 --> 24:27.833
to whom God's love commits me here.

24:28.625 --> 24:30.416
Ever this day, be at my side,

24:31.750 --> 24:33.666
to light and guard, to rule and guide.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.833
Angel of God, my guardian dear,

24:36.791 --> 24:38.541
to whom God's love commits me here.

24:39.208 --> 24:42.333
Ever this day, be at my side,
to light and guard, and to rule and guide.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.166
Angel of God, my guardian dear,

24:46.625 --> 24:48.750
to whom God's love commits me here.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.791
Ever this day, be at my side,
to light and guard, to rule and guide.

24:53.208 --> 24:54.708
Angel of God, my guardian dear…

24:56.541 --> 24:57.458
Father Paul.

24:57.541 --> 25:01.583
Hi. Sorry to call after dark.
I was a little ill, held up all day.

25:01.666 --> 25:06.708
But now I'm up and about again,
and I thought I owe your mother her mass.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.541
[knocking at door]

25:16.291 --> 25:17.208
John?

25:22.583 --> 25:24.875
Sarah let me in. She said that you…

25:28.041 --> 25:29.541
That you're feeling better.

25:30.416 --> 25:31.416
How?

25:32.958 --> 25:34.250
How?

25:34.333 --> 25:37.208
"Well, truly, I say to you,
if you have faith and never doubt,

25:37.291 --> 25:40.916
even if you say
to this mountain be taken up

25:41.000 --> 25:44.458
and cast into the sea, it will be done."

25:45.666 --> 25:47.416
With God, all things are possible.

26:03.833 --> 26:05.666
I thought it was a dream.

26:08.250 --> 26:11.375
When I saw you at my bedside.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.250
So young.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.791
[both exclaim]

26:19.250 --> 26:20.958
Maybe it is a dream.

26:22.750 --> 26:24.958
But if it is, we're all having it.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.583
All of us.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.458
I have so much to tell you!

26:33.541 --> 26:34.583
[both chuckle]

26:37.125 --> 26:38.125
But…

26:39.041 --> 26:43.375
But first… your mass.

26:44.625 --> 26:45.791
Your Communion.

26:48.500 --> 26:52.958
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.291
Amen.

27:02.958 --> 27:05.541
I'm just realizing
that you must think I'm foolish.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.875
No.

27:08.750 --> 27:10.125
You prayed with me all day,

27:11.250 --> 27:13.416
and I love you for that. [sniffles]

27:14.208 --> 27:15.375
But you don't…

27:16.916 --> 27:19.416
You don't believe it. Any of it.

27:20.416 --> 27:21.416
I understand it.

27:23.208 --> 27:25.833
I do. The appeal of it. The comfort of it.

27:27.416 --> 27:29.083
Everything happens for a reason.

27:29.166 --> 27:31.708
There's good in everything.
There's a plan. It's…

27:36.375 --> 27:37.625
I don't know.

27:39.916 --> 27:44.208
I guess I just lived
a moment at complete odds

27:44.791 --> 27:46.833
with the existence of a loving God.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.750
So what do you think?

27:50.375 --> 27:53.250
-You think I'm delusional?
-No.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.916
-You think I'm naive.
-No.

27:59.333 --> 28:00.583
No, I think…

28:02.916 --> 28:04.416
I think we all want…

28:06.583 --> 28:09.708
so badly for there to be a reason.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.958
For everything. And some justice,
and some comfort when we die.

28:15.041 --> 28:18.416
Yeah, that's where religion comes from.
That's the whole question.

28:19.708 --> 28:20.916
It is.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.041
What happens when we die?

28:24.125 --> 28:25.791
What the fuck happens?

28:25.875 --> 28:27.166
So what do you think?

28:28.625 --> 28:30.458
What happens when we die, Riley?

28:32.500 --> 28:33.708
I don't know.

28:34.708 --> 28:37.541
And I don't trust anyone
who tells us they do, but…

28:41.208 --> 28:43.166
I can speak for myself, I guess.

28:44.083 --> 28:45.375
Then speak for yourself.

28:46.375 --> 28:48.333
What happens when you die?

28:49.458 --> 28:50.458
[sighs]

28:55.166 --> 28:56.291
When I die…

28:59.666 --> 29:02.000
my body stops functioning.

29:03.375 --> 29:06.125
Shut down. All at once, or gradually,

29:06.208 --> 29:09.041
my breathing stops,
my heart stops beating.

29:10.333 --> 29:11.458
Clinical death.

29:12.666 --> 29:16.708
And a bit later, like,
five whole minutes later…

29:18.875 --> 29:20.291
my brain cells start dying.

29:24.791 --> 29:28.541
But in the meantime, in between…

29:30.958 --> 29:33.958
maybe my brain releases a flood of DMT.

29:34.458 --> 29:37.583
It's the psychedelic drug
released when we dream, so…

29:39.416 --> 29:40.333
I dream.

29:42.125 --> 29:46.166
I dream bigger
than I have ever dreamed before,

29:46.250 --> 29:50.291
because it's all of it.
Just the last dump of DMT all at once.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.750
And my neurons are firing

29:52.833 --> 29:56.583
and I'm seeing this firework display
of memories and imagination.

29:56.666 --> 29:59.708
And I am just… tripping.

30:00.250 --> 30:05.083
I mean, really tripping balls because
my mind's rifling through the memories.

30:05.166 --> 30:09.333
You know, long and short-term,
and the dreams mix with the memories, and…

30:12.250 --> 30:13.458
it's a curtain call.

30:15.708 --> 30:18.250
The dream to end all dreams.

30:18.333 --> 30:24.208
One last great dream as my mind empties
the fuckin' missile silos and then…

30:29.583 --> 30:30.500
I stop.

30:33.666 --> 30:38.708
My brain activity ceases
and there is nothing left of me.

30:40.958 --> 30:41.916
No pain.

30:44.416 --> 30:47.958
No memory, no awareness
that I ever was, no…

30:51.083 --> 30:52.333
That I ever hurt someone.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.500
[voice breaking] That I ever
killed someone.

31:05.041 --> 31:08.500
Everything is as it was

31:09.666 --> 31:10.750
before me.

31:13.416 --> 31:17.333
And the electricity disperses
from my brain till it's just dead tissue.

31:19.041 --> 31:19.916
Meat.

31:21.750 --> 31:22.833
Oblivion.

31:27.125 --> 31:29.833
And all of the other little things
that make me up, they…

31:31.333 --> 31:34.708
The microbes and bacterium
and the billion other little things

31:34.791 --> 31:39.083
that live on my eyelashes and in my hair
and in my mouth and on my skin

31:39.166 --> 31:41.458
and in my gut
and everywhere else, they just

31:43.208 --> 31:44.125
keep on living.

31:46.333 --> 31:47.333
And eating.

31:49.041 --> 31:49.875
Uh…

31:53.166 --> 31:55.166
And I'm serving a purpose.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.500
I'm feeding life.

32:02.708 --> 32:03.833
And I'm broken apart,

32:03.916 --> 32:07.833
and all the littlest pieces of me
are just recycled,

32:07.916 --> 32:09.916
and I'm billions of other places.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.416
And my atoms are in plants
and bugs and animals,

32:14.500 --> 32:17.083
and I am like the stars
that are in the sky.

32:19.833 --> 32:23.791
There one moment and then just
scattered across the goddamn cosmos.

32:37.125 --> 32:38.041
Your turn.

32:39.083 --> 32:42.000
[chuckles] What happens when you die?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.083
Speaking for myself?

32:47.541 --> 32:48.750
Speaking for yourself.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.416
No.

32:56.416 --> 32:57.500
Not for myself.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.416
I'm not the one that died today.

33:07.041 --> 33:08.375
She was never awake.

33:10.458 --> 33:13.000
When she came down into this little body,

33:14.500 --> 33:16.750
this just-forming little body,
it was asleep.

33:17.458 --> 33:19.250
So all she ever knew was dreaming.

33:22.041 --> 33:25.208
She only ever dreamed.
She didn't even have a name.

33:27.125 --> 33:28.375
And then in her sleep,

33:29.791 --> 33:32.833
that perfect little spirit just lifted up.

33:34.625 --> 33:37.958
Because God didn't send her
to suffer through life on Earth. No.

33:39.166 --> 33:40.208
This one?

33:42.041 --> 33:43.541
This special little soul…

33:45.458 --> 33:47.791
God just sent her down here to sleep.

33:50.916 --> 33:53.750
Just a little nap. A quick dream.

33:55.666 --> 33:57.833
And then He called her back.
He wanted her back.

33:59.333 --> 34:00.500
And so she went back.

34:01.125 --> 34:04.916
Same as she floated down,
she rose up above the Earth.

34:06.250 --> 34:08.208
Past all the souls in the atmosphere

34:08.291 --> 34:12.041
and all the stars in the sky
and then into a light so bright.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.208
And then, for the first time…

34:19.416 --> 34:20.875
she starts to wake up.

34:26.416 --> 34:28.958
She's wrapped in a feeling of love.

34:29.625 --> 34:33.083
Just pure, amazing love.
Of course she is. [laughing]

34:33.166 --> 34:34.375
She's pure.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.000
She has never sinned.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.583
She never hurt a single living thing,
not even an ant.

34:42.375 --> 34:45.875
And she's not alone. She's home.

34:47.416 --> 34:49.166
There are people there,
she doesn't know it,

34:49.250 --> 34:50.583
but they're her family.

34:51.250 --> 34:56.250
Her grandfather and her great-grandfather,
and they love her. And they name her.

34:57.916 --> 35:00.500
And then when God reaches down
and kisses her head,

35:00.583 --> 35:03.541
and the second He says her name,
she grows up.

35:04.375 --> 35:05.416
In a blink.

35:10.541 --> 35:11.625
And she's perfect.

35:14.916 --> 35:18.000
Her body as it would have been
on her best day on Earth.

35:18.583 --> 35:22.291
Her perfect age. The peak of herself.

35:25.583 --> 35:27.791
And they tell her
about her mom down here on Earth,

35:27.875 --> 35:29.500
and how I'll be there soon enough.

35:29.583 --> 35:31.708
[breathes deeply]

35:32.625 --> 35:37.125
And she's happy.
And nothing but joy for all eternity.

35:39.583 --> 35:40.708
And she's loved.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.375
And she isn't alone.

35:48.041 --> 35:50.250
And that's what we mean
when we say Heaven.

35:51.208 --> 35:56.500
No mansions, no rivers of diamonds,
or fluffy clouds or angel wings.

35:57.750 --> 35:58.958
You are loved.

36:00.333 --> 36:01.541
And you aren't alone.

36:08.208 --> 36:09.333
That is God.

36:10.958 --> 36:12.375
That is Heaven.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.541
That's why we endure
all that we endure on this…

36:19.125 --> 36:21.875
big, blue, sad rock.

36:26.416 --> 36:27.916
I'll be there soon enough.

36:31.666 --> 36:33.166
And I'll see my father.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.583
And my grandmother.

36:37.708 --> 36:42.500
And I'll see my little girl,
and she will be happy and safe.

36:45.291 --> 36:48.416
And I will be so glad to meet her.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.166
I really hope you're right.

37:13.000 --> 37:14.125
[Father Paul inhales]

37:14.208 --> 37:16.875

to whom God's love commits me here.

37:16.958 --> 37:20.458
Ever this day [inhales] be at my side,
to light and guard, to rule and guide.

38:35.958 --> 38:36.958
[Joe] Father?

38:41.875 --> 38:43.875
[hesitating] I'm sorry to disturb you.

38:44.625 --> 38:45.625
I'm sorry.

38:46.416 --> 38:47.708
Hello, Joe.

38:48.333 --> 38:52.375
-Hello.
-I was just… I, um… I had a hard day.

38:53.416 --> 38:55.541
But I did good. I didn't drink.

38:55.625 --> 38:56.875
Yeah, that's excellent.

38:56.958 --> 39:00.125
But it's a real struggle.
You know? And you said come by here

39:01.083 --> 39:02.375
if I ever felt like…

39:03.333 --> 39:07.083
If it got too much.
But you're… you're busy.

39:07.166 --> 39:09.708
No, not at all. Here.
You come in here. You sit.

39:09.791 --> 39:10.666
[sniffs]

39:13.291 --> 39:16.333
I've been there.
I can tell you that. [chuckles]

39:17.000 --> 39:17.833
[groans]

39:19.958 --> 39:22.250
-Are you okay, Father?
-Um…

39:23.166 --> 39:24.791
Truth be told, I…

39:26.958 --> 39:30.958
I'm not really feelin' myself today,
and I am at a bit of a loss.

39:39.750 --> 39:41.000
Well, that's uncanny, ain't it?

39:47.833 --> 39:49.166
You could be his son.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.375
You know, that was a rumor
when I was a kid,

39:52.458 --> 39:55.833
that the old man wasn't exactly celibate.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.833
I mean, who can blame him?

39:57.916 --> 40:00.708
I mean, who am I
to judge a man for his vices?

40:00.791 --> 40:01.958
I mean, me? Shit.

40:03.666 --> 40:05.750
None of my business. Really.

40:07.166 --> 40:08.875
Kinda my motto my whole life.

40:10.916 --> 40:12.125
I'll, uh… I'll…

40:13.125 --> 40:14.916
I'll see ya tomorrow at, um…

40:16.875 --> 40:19.625
-At the… at the meeting.
-Hey, wait, wait, Joe.

40:26.541 --> 40:28.833
I'm proud of you, Joe.

40:29.416 --> 40:30.375
Thanks, Father.

40:30.458 --> 40:35.583
[hesitating] I'm sorry. I wasn't
expecting anyone, but I'm proud of you,

40:35.666 --> 40:38.541
and I'm glad
that you found strength today.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.000
Because I know that compulsion.

40:43.458 --> 40:44.875
That hunger, and…

40:47.000 --> 40:49.500
I know how hard it is to fight against.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.125
So I'm proud of you. God is proud of you.

40:54.750 --> 40:55.833
Thank you.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.625
God bless you.

41:05.166 --> 41:07.125
Better late than never, right? [chuckles]

41:08.416 --> 41:09.416
All right.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.791
-[Father Paul] God bless you.
-Oh, thank you. I'm gonna…

41:12.875 --> 41:15.916
Um… I'm just gonna… I'm gonna go.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.625
[Father Paul sniffs]

41:18.541 --> 41:21.000
[Joe] I'm gonna go, okay?

41:21.083 --> 41:23.833
-I'm just… I'm gonna go, all right?
-God bless you.

41:23.916 --> 41:25.666
What is wrong with you?

41:27.666 --> 41:31.666
The fuck is wrong with you?
Stop it! [grunts]

41:35.833 --> 41:37.916
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.041
-[Joe gasps]
-I'm so sorry.

41:40.791 --> 41:41.750
Are you…

41:42.750 --> 41:43.875
Are you okay?

41:44.791 --> 41:45.750
What happened?

41:45.833 --> 41:47.041
[Joe gasping]

41:47.125 --> 41:49.625
Are you all right? Are you all right?

41:49.708 --> 41:51.166
[Joe grunts]

42:06.458 --> 42:07.583
What?

42:10.958 --> 42:13.250
-[Joe exclaims]
-[Father Paul shushes]

42:14.750 --> 42:16.250
[slurping]

42:57.833 --> 43:00.208
-Hi.
-Hi.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.083
I had that dream again last night.

43:09.500 --> 43:12.500
-The one on the water?
-Yeah, that's right.

43:13.875 --> 43:17.458
It was all different this time.
You know that happens sometimes?

43:18.125 --> 43:19.833
I never remember my dreams.

43:21.458 --> 43:22.625
What was different?

43:22.708 --> 43:23.625
I'm on the water,

43:25.041 --> 43:26.125
just like always…

43:28.166 --> 43:30.000
waiting on the sun. But this time…

43:38.541 --> 43:39.750
you're there too.

43:42.041 --> 43:43.500
What do you think that means?

43:50.916 --> 43:52.208
I should go.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.083
Unless you want me to walk you?

43:58.500 --> 44:00.375
-Hmm?
-Church.

44:02.000 --> 44:02.875
Oh.

44:04.666 --> 44:06.583
I don't think I'm gonna go to church.

44:08.250 --> 44:10.291
I think I'm gonna go to the mainland.

44:12.083 --> 44:15.291
You know, not to, like,
get a second opinion or anything, but…

44:18.416 --> 44:19.750
To get a second opinion.

44:20.625 --> 44:21.958
Of course.

44:22.041 --> 44:25.000
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't
leave this house for a month.

44:25.083 --> 44:26.083
Nobody would.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.583
You could come back though.

44:31.958 --> 44:32.875
Later.

44:34.708 --> 44:35.791
Maybe tonight.

44:37.208 --> 44:40.208
You could come back tonight, maybe.

44:43.333 --> 44:44.541
I can do that.

44:46.375 --> 44:47.291
Okay.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.291
[sighs]

45:14.000 --> 45:16.833
-I'm not gonna do Communion or anything.
-I know.

45:18.208 --> 45:19.208
You can't.

45:20.791 --> 45:23.166
They won't let you,
because you're not a Christian.

45:23.250 --> 45:25.500
-Dad. Please, we've been over this.
-I know.

45:25.583 --> 45:27.041
-You said I could--
-I know.

45:32.916 --> 45:33.791
Look.

45:35.291 --> 45:36.916
I understand you're curious.

45:38.833 --> 45:42.833
I will not tell my son
not to look for God.

45:44.833 --> 45:46.041
But, son…

45:49.708 --> 45:51.041
We already have Him.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.875
Well, thank you, Dad.

Good morning.

49:29.708 --> 49:31.583
Let me tell you, it is such a delight

49:31.666 --> 49:34.833
to see this church
so full every day. God bless.

I'm afraid this morning,
though, we'll have to…

I think we'll have to cancel mass.

the dear man, put him to bed.

50:08.125 --> 50:09.208
Come up here, Dolly.

50:10.291 --> 50:11.541
Come on up.

50:11.625 --> 50:16.208
Maybe Dolly can lead us in some singing
and some reading and some prayer.

50:16.791 --> 50:20.625
And we can still celebrate
like the Christians of old

50:20.708 --> 50:24.666

there were priests to lead the way.

-Sure.

50:49.083 --> 50:51.250
take it to one of the empty houses
on the west bank.

50:51.333 --> 50:53.416
Do it now,
while most of the island is at church.

50:53.500 --> 50:57.958
And then tonight, late, tie an anchor
to it and drop it five miles out.

51:01.041 --> 51:02.958
But, I… We…

51:03.791 --> 51:05.250
[hesitates]

51:05.333 --> 51:07.416
Yes. Wade, what would you like to say?

51:08.166 --> 51:09.125
I mean…

51:11.750 --> 51:14.041
We're not… We're not really…

51:14.125 --> 51:17.500
That's Joe Collie, Bev. This is…

51:19.833 --> 51:22.875
This is… This is…
What the hell did you do?

51:25.958 --> 51:29.375
"The man who acts presumptuously
by not obeying the Priest

51:29.458 --> 51:32.208
who stands to minister there
before the Lord, your God,

51:32.291 --> 51:33.958
that man shall die."

51:35.833 --> 51:36.875
Deuteronomy.

51:38.583 --> 51:39.750
You are correct.

51:41.458 --> 51:42.666
This is Joe Collie.

51:42.750 --> 51:47.750
This isn't Ed Flynn
or Leeza Scarborough or you, Wade.

51:47.833 --> 51:50.333
This is the man
that put your daughter in a wheelchair.

51:50.416 --> 51:55.000
This man has been a scourge
to this community his entire life.

51:55.083 --> 51:59.166
He's a sinner, a letch,
and a heathen of the first order.

51:59.250 --> 52:01.750
He's a maimer of children
and a blessing to no one,

52:01.833 --> 52:03.833
and God has called in his debt.

52:04.500 --> 52:09.083
Father. Monsignor. Tell them.
Tell them why you did what you did.

52:09.166 --> 52:12.250
I don't know. Something came over me,
and really, I don't even--

52:12.333 --> 52:15.083
Because something moved through you.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.125
You forget. Wade, you forget.

52:17.208 --> 52:19.666
Our Lord is a warrior,
and so are His angels.

52:20.250 --> 52:23.500
Our Lord sent angels to Egypt

52:23.583 --> 52:26.791
to slaughter the firstborn
of the Egyptians,

52:26.875 --> 52:30.583
turned cities to salt,
women and children alike,

52:30.666 --> 52:35.416
and drowned the world
when we were too lost to our sins.

52:36.333 --> 52:41.166
Monsignor Pruitt himself
is a miracle of God.

52:42.416 --> 52:45.041
And a performer of miracles,

52:46.125 --> 52:49.166
as you damn well know yourself, Wade.
He is a miracle.

52:50.041 --> 52:52.375
God has a plan. He's working through him.

52:52.458 --> 52:56.791
"And we are to do our part
to witness and do our part."

52:56.875 --> 52:59.958
"And do not think
that I have come to bring peace."

53:00.041 --> 53:03.250
"I have not come
to bring peace, but a sword."

53:03.333 --> 53:07.208
It was Jesus who said that!
Jesus Christ himself!

53:07.291 --> 53:10.166
So if you wanna question him now, Wade,

53:10.250 --> 53:15.083
if you want to pick and choose which one
of his works are palatable to you…

53:16.250 --> 53:19.625
Return all his graces to sender then,

53:19.708 --> 53:24.541
and let your little girl
sit back down in that wheelchair.

53:25.708 --> 53:31.333
But do not cherry-pick the glories of God!

53:32.625 --> 53:35.833
Now wrap it up

53:37.541 --> 53:38.625
in the carpet.

53:42.916 --> 53:44.625
I… I… I…

53:51.750 --> 53:53.208
Is your conscience heavy?

53:54.875 --> 53:58.208
Do you have guilt in your heart
for doing what you had to?

54:00.125 --> 54:01.083
No.

54:05.291 --> 54:06.416
Not at all.

54:06.500 --> 54:10.125
Then ask yourself
why God let that cup pass you by.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.416
And carry on.

54:16.333 --> 54:17.500
[Wade mumbles indistinctly]

54:19.458 --> 54:21.541
His arms. Sturge, his arms.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.333
Get the… And…

54:29.541 --> 54:30.458
[knocking at door]

54:34.708 --> 54:40.125
Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting.
We've, um… We've run your labs.

54:41.083 --> 54:43.916
I wonder if perhaps
the information you've given me

54:44.000 --> 54:46.125
might not be entirely accurate.

54:46.208 --> 54:48.375
I'll put you in touch with my doctor,

54:48.458 --> 54:51.166
and she can make sure
you have the correct information.

54:51.250 --> 54:53.125
I just wanna know how this could happen.

54:53.208 --> 54:56.000
Well, I don't believe anything has.

54:58.250 --> 55:01.666
-What does that mean?
-I mean, your tests are all negative.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.000
I know. I lost the baby.

55:04.083 --> 55:07.291
No, I mean your hCG levels are normal.

55:07.375 --> 55:08.208
Okay?

55:08.291 --> 55:12.875
And even after a miscarriage,
they'd stay elevated six weeks or so.

55:12.958 --> 55:18.166
Right, I didn't have…
There was no evidence of miscarriage.

55:19.500 --> 55:23.916
Um, I don't see any evidence
you were pregnant at all.

55:27.208 --> 55:28.541
I had an ultrasound.

55:28.625 --> 55:32.125
Look, I don't know anything about that.
I'm just looking at your tests.

55:32.208 --> 55:33.708
I heard the heartbeat many times.

55:33.791 --> 55:36.125
I saw her move.
I saw her sucking her thumb.

55:36.208 --> 55:38.583
I am happy
to call your doctor on the island,

55:39.125 --> 55:41.708
and maybe she'll share some of her…

55:42.958 --> 55:46.833
But your body isn't the body of a woman
who's been pregnant. It just isn't.

55:47.416 --> 55:52.083
-I was pregnant. I was.
-Not according to your blood or your body.

55:52.833 --> 55:55.375
And the human body, it can't, well…

55:56.083 --> 55:58.458
It just can't pull a rip cord
on something like that

55:58.541 --> 56:01.083
and pretend nothing happened.
It's just not possible.

56:03.500 --> 56:06.166
I was wondering
if perhaps we could arrange

56:06.250 --> 56:08.625
for you to speak with someone
in our psych department.

56:36.500 --> 56:37.708
[sighs]

56:52.333 --> 56:53.291
[Riley] You feeling better?

56:55.666 --> 56:59.083
I wasn't sure if this was happening.
No one answered when I called the rectory.

57:00.041 --> 57:03.166
[Father Paul] Nothing to worry about.
Feelin' much better as the day went on.

57:03.250 --> 57:04.375
Come on in.

57:04.958 --> 57:05.916
I'm so sorry to hear that.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.166
I'll have to visit her
and make sure she's all right.

57:09.250 --> 57:10.916
Yeah, she's takin' it easy.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.458
I don't think she'll really
be up for visitors any time soon.

57:13.541 --> 57:14.416
No, of course.

57:15.625 --> 57:21.083
Out of curiosity,
what would you have said to her?

57:24.333 --> 57:26.583
That's the thing, isn't it?
What do you say?

57:26.666 --> 57:28.833
You say, "I'm so sorry for your loss."

57:28.916 --> 57:31.125
Or, "God works in mysterious ways."

57:31.208 --> 57:33.041
"If there's anything that I can do."

57:33.125 --> 57:35.416
It's so hollow, isn't it?

57:35.500 --> 57:37.000
I don't… Will not…

57:40.083 --> 57:43.750
We can never understand the will of God,

57:43.833 --> 57:47.708
and I wouldn't presume to know what to say
to Erin Greene, other than that.

57:53.541 --> 57:56.208
We must trust in the Lord
with our whole heart.

57:58.458 --> 58:00.833
And not rely on our own insights.

58:00.916 --> 58:03.750
Give yourself over
whether you understand it or not.

58:03.833 --> 58:05.000
That's right. That's right.

58:05.083 --> 58:09.000
That's just… Well, that's just true.
Isn't it? For you, for me?

58:09.958 --> 58:12.375
Give ourselves over, maybe for a moment.

58:12.458 --> 58:17.541
You know, stop presuming to know
the reason, to understand the meaning.

58:18.208 --> 58:22.291
Sometimes it's okay
to just look at the world and say,

58:22.375 --> 58:25.791
"Why? Why? Why? I don't understand."

58:27.875 --> 58:29.166
"And I will not."

58:31.791 --> 58:33.250
Yeah, sometimes that's okay.

58:36.125 --> 58:37.791
Yeah, I actually agree with that.

58:39.125 --> 58:41.000
It's hard not to, isn't it? [chuckles]

58:41.875 --> 58:43.291
How are your amends going?

58:45.041 --> 58:48.000
We gonna get into that now?
Shouldn't we wait for Joe?

58:49.291 --> 58:50.541
Oh. Uh…

58:50.625 --> 58:52.875
No. Joe isn't joining us today, actually.

58:52.958 --> 58:53.875
No.

58:55.166 --> 58:57.708
No, please don't tell me he fell off.

58:59.250 --> 59:01.958
I don't know why,
I just really wanted this to work for him.

59:02.041 --> 59:04.416
Like, I really, really did.

59:04.500 --> 59:07.791
No, no. I actually saw him yesterday.
He was…

59:08.750 --> 59:11.375
He was doin' well.
He was proud of himself.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.875
No, he's off-island today,
visiting his sister, I think.

59:14.958 --> 59:18.500
Uh, he's not sure when he's gonna be back.

59:19.625 --> 59:21.375
-His sister?
-Yeah, that's right.

59:24.583 --> 59:25.541
Oh.

59:27.333 --> 59:31.250
So, shall we begin with Serenity?
I'm sure he'll grace us next week.

59:33.458 --> 59:36.166
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things…

59:36.250 --> 59:39.416
[both] …I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can,

59:39.500 --> 59:41.916
and the wisdom to know the difference.

59:42.791 --> 59:43.666
Amen.

59:46.458 --> 59:48.625
[Annie] I'm just glad to hear
that he's all right.

59:48.708 --> 59:51.000
I'm not surprised,
as hard as he's been working lately.

59:51.083 --> 59:54.416
Daily mass, packed,
and a full schedule, besides.

59:54.500 --> 59:58.583
Do you know that he's brought
Mildred Gunning the sacrament every day

59:58.666 --> 1:00:00.500
since he's been here? Every day.

1:00:01.375 --> 1:00:02.500
The man's a saint.

1:00:03.125 --> 1:00:06.750
I'm glad he's on the mend.
And your little friend Ali.

1:00:06.833 --> 1:00:08.625
I was so moved to see him in church today.

1:00:10.375 --> 1:00:12.166
I can't imagine how
that went over with his dad.

1:00:12.250 --> 1:00:14.583
The courage it had
to take to leave that behind,

1:00:14.666 --> 1:00:16.583
to come to church alone, at his age?

1:00:17.208 --> 1:00:20.541
With his upbringing?
All that tradition. It just shows you.

1:00:21.166 --> 1:00:23.750
God finds a way. God, find the way.

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.416
Heading out for the night, huh?

1:00:29.500 --> 1:00:30.416
Yeah.

1:00:31.333 --> 1:00:32.708
[Annie] Well, give her my best.

1:00:33.416 --> 1:00:36.083
-Tell her I'm so sorry.
-I will.

1:00:37.416 --> 1:00:40.541
You know, when you were a little boy,

1:00:42.583 --> 1:00:45.125
you said to me, "If we're on an island,

1:00:45.208 --> 1:00:48.416
why don't we live in treehouses
like Swiss Family Robinson?"

1:00:49.041 --> 1:00:52.541
And I said to you,
"Well, we're not shipwrecked, Riley."

1:00:53.166 --> 1:00:54.750
"We're meant to be here."

1:00:56.750 --> 1:00:57.791
And you,

1:00:58.708 --> 1:00:59.750
you frowned.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:04.500
I know you never really felt
like this was home.

1:01:05.541 --> 1:01:08.916
Like Crockett wasn't
so much a place we lived

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:12.250
as a place we lived through,
waiting for help to come.

1:01:12.333 --> 1:01:13.250
[chuckles]

1:01:15.458 --> 1:01:19.125
And, well, help is here.

1:01:20.750 --> 1:01:23.666
-Is it?
-I don't need my glasses anymore.

1:01:24.666 --> 1:01:27.250
And your father's better
than he's been in years.

1:01:28.583 --> 1:01:30.250
Something's happening here.

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.625
And I can't pretend it isn't.

1:01:34.375 --> 1:01:35.375
Now, I know…

1:01:37.625 --> 1:01:38.750
you struggled.

1:01:39.833 --> 1:01:43.000
With your faith and with what happened--

1:01:43.083 --> 1:01:44.416
With what I did.

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:51.458
With what you did.

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:54.458
[voice breaking] My beautiful boy.

1:01:55.458 --> 1:01:56.458
Yes.

1:01:58.083 --> 1:02:03.916
But God isn't asking you to have faith
in something that you can't see.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:07.333
Not here. Not now.

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.083
He's only asking that you look.

1:02:11.583 --> 1:02:13.000
Isn't that amazing?

1:02:16.583 --> 1:02:18.125
He's a liar, Mom.

1:02:19.750 --> 1:02:20.875
Father Paul.

1:02:23.208 --> 1:02:24.375
Maybe you're right.

1:02:26.083 --> 1:02:27.291
Maybe there is hope.

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:32.125
And maybe there's something for me,
and maybe there is God and miracles.

1:02:33.500 --> 1:02:34.416
I don't know.

1:02:36.875 --> 1:02:40.791
But I know one thing.
Just one thing for a fact.

1:02:42.416 --> 1:02:44.375
Father Paul lied to me tonight.

1:02:47.250 --> 1:02:50.625
So believe and pray for me.

1:02:52.250 --> 1:02:53.250
But just…

1:02:56.541 --> 1:02:58.916
Please be careful. That's all I ask.

1:03:01.500 --> 1:03:02.625
[Annie] Oh.

1:03:03.333 --> 1:03:04.708
Oh.

1:03:06.250 --> 1:03:07.125
Yeah.

1:03:09.125 --> 1:03:10.125
Oh.

1:03:23.833 --> 1:03:25.708
…my guardian dear,
to whom God's love commits me here.

1:03:25.791 --> 1:03:28.291
Ever this day be at my side to light
and guard, to rule and guide.

1:03:28.375 --> 1:03:30.416
Angel of God, please, please, please.

1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:32.416
Where are you? Where are you?

1:03:32.500 --> 1:03:34.958
Please, please, please.

1:03:35.041 --> 1:03:37.750
Angel of God, my guardian dear,
to whom God's love commits me here.

1:03:37.833 --> 1:03:40.708
Ever this day, be at my side,
to light and guard, to rule and guide.

1:03:42.125 --> 1:03:44.125
[continues reciting prayer]

1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.791
Oh, thank God.
Where have you been? I've been…

1:03:59.625 --> 1:04:00.708
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1:04:01.375 --> 1:04:04.541
I'm sorry, I've just been lost.
I've just been lost.

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:08.416
I don't… I'm out of the sacrament.

1:04:09.958 --> 1:04:11.208
[breathing heavily]

1:04:20.083 --> 1:04:23.208
Angel of God, my guardian dear,
to whom God's love commits me here.

1:04:23.291 --> 1:04:26.166
Ever this day, be at my side,
to light and guard, to rule and guide.

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.458
Angel of God, my guardian dear…

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:36.833
[continues reciting prayer]

1:05:12.833 --> 1:05:13.791
His sister.

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:38.958
[reciting prayer]

1:05:56.208 --> 1:05:57.125
Oh.

1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:03.750
[creature growls]

1:06:03.833 --> 1:06:04.833
[Riley exclaims]

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.666
[groaning]
