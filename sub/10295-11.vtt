00:25.235 --> 00:29.200

00:29.235 --> 00:31.133

01:18.033 --> 01:20.901
Al, come on down!
It's time for work!

01:24.400 --> 01:25.901
Come on, honey.

01:25.936 --> 01:28.901
I'm making you
a nice, hot breakfast.

01:28.936 --> 01:32.400
Just listen
to that bacon sizzle.

01:35.903 --> 01:37.300
Keep it hot, Peg.

01:37.335 --> 01:38.801
I'll be down
in a minute.

01:38.836 --> 01:40.501
Sure, I will.

01:40.536 --> 01:42.501
Peggy, I've got
some great news.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.000
Two men came
to our house-

01:45.035 --> 01:47.000
Al, I'm going
over to Marcie's!

01:47.035 --> 01:48.367
They're gone now.

01:50.601 --> 01:52.167
Al, Marcie's here.

01:52.202 --> 01:55.167
Nice try, Peg,
but I'm still hungry.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.667
Where's my breakfast?

01:56.702 --> 01:58.300
The dog ate it.

01:58.335 --> 02:02.901
I see he put the pots
and pans away too.

02:02.936 --> 02:06.901
Al, I was just telling Peggy
about this great idea.

02:06.936 --> 02:09.901
You know that little hole
in your driveway,

02:09.936 --> 02:11.901
the one all the neighborhood
children splash and play in

02:11.936 --> 02:13.901
after it rains?

02:13.936 --> 02:15.501
These guys just finished
a major repaving job

02:15.536 --> 02:17.400
a couple of blocks from here.

02:17.435 --> 02:20.901
And they offered to redo both
our driveways for only $500.

02:20.936 --> 02:22.467
Isn't that great?

02:22.502 --> 02:23.968
I don't know.

02:24.003 --> 02:26.968
I tried to get Al to fix
the driveway a long time ago,

02:27.003 --> 02:28.467
But his philosophy is

02:28.502 --> 02:32.467
"Why improve a home you're
only going to live in anyway?"

02:34.167 --> 02:36.167
Al, can you think
of a better way

02:36.202 --> 02:38.033
to raise the value
of your home

02:38.068 --> 02:39.634
and save a little money
in the bargain?

02:39.669 --> 02:41.968
Sure.
Pack your bags, hon.

02:43.701 --> 02:45.701
Look they said we have
to do this right away

02:45.736 --> 02:46.701
or they'll be gone.

02:46.736 --> 02:48.400
And I think
it's a great deal.

02:48.435 --> 02:51.033
Uh-huh.
What does Steve think?

02:51.068 --> 02:53.534
Well, he's in Buffalo
at a meeting

02:53.569 --> 02:55.367
of Tellers
Against the Penny.

02:55.402 --> 02:56.767
Steve firmly believes
that the one-cent piece

02:56.802 --> 02:57.934
is a thing of the past.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.634
Well, I'm sure the feeling
is mutual.

03:00.669 --> 03:02.133
Come on, Al, make a decision.

03:02.168 --> 03:05.133
These guys are leaving
the neighborhood.

03:05.168 --> 03:06.334
Of course they're leaving
the neighborhood.

03:06.369 --> 03:07.467
These guys are crooks.

03:07.502 --> 03:08.868
First you gotta believe
they just happen

03:08.903 --> 03:10.367
to be in the neighborhood.

03:10.402 --> 03:12.501
And second, we have to believe

03:12.536 --> 03:13.868
these two guys see Marcie,

03:13.903 --> 03:15.801
and they're willing
to come back.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.400
I mean, is there
nothing so stupid

03:19.435 --> 03:21.567
that some woman
won't fall for it?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.434
I fell for you,
sweetie.

03:25.067 --> 03:26.567
How could you marry

03:26.602 --> 03:28.567
such a chauvinistic,
sexist man?

03:28.602 --> 03:29.901
A dare.

03:31.267 --> 03:32.634
Look, I'm not sexist.

03:32.669 --> 03:35.634
I'm just saying women
don't know nothing.

03:35.669 --> 03:38.667
Asphalt and finances
are male-oriented fields.

03:38.702 --> 03:43.167
Since Steve is as close
to a male as you have,

03:43.202 --> 03:45.200
he should be in
on the decision.

03:45.235 --> 03:47.567
I'll have you know
I have a degree in economics

03:47.602 --> 03:51.067
and work as a loan
officer in a bank.

03:51.102 --> 03:52.501
So if anything,
I am more qualified

03:52.536 --> 03:55.267
to make financial
decisions than you are.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.934
As good as you bankers
may be at saying,

03:58.969 --> 04:00.434
"We're sorry,
Farmer Brown,

04:00.469 --> 04:02.434
we're foreclosing.
Go sell pencils,"

04:02.469 --> 04:04.934
in this house,
I'm the boss,

04:04.969 --> 04:07.501
and I make
the financial decisions.

04:07.536 --> 04:11.334
And what a shrewd financial
decider he is too.

04:11.369 --> 04:14.501
Come on, honey.
Tell her about the time

04:14.536 --> 04:16.666
you shrewdly decided not
to buy into that property

04:16.702 --> 04:21.000
that some sucker
built the Sears Tower on.

04:21.035 --> 04:22.501
Don't forget, Peg.

04:22.536 --> 04:24.501
The money
we saved there

04:24.536 --> 04:27.501
allowed us to buy
that 2/3 acre

04:27.536 --> 04:29.000
on lake Chicamacomico.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.501
It may not look
like much now,

04:30.536 --> 04:31.701
but when they figure
out how

04:31.736 --> 04:34.501
to keep plants
and animals alive there,

04:34.536 --> 04:36.234
that's gonna be quite
a little paradise.

04:36.269 --> 04:39.934
I'll bet. But Al, I know
a good thing when I see it too.

04:39.969 --> 04:42.133
And even without you,
the deal is still a good one,

04:42.168 --> 04:43.901
and I'm going to do it.

04:43.936 --> 04:46.734
Well, you are woman.
Go out and roar.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.434
Mmm. I'm full.

04:52.567 --> 04:54.934
Peg, as usual,
every day's Thanksgiving.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.901
I'm going to work.

04:58.936 --> 05:00.534
Marce, I'll see you tonight.

05:00.569 --> 05:01.901
What for?

05:01.936 --> 05:03.300
Well, after these guys
rip you off,

05:03.335 --> 05:05.167
you'll be back
to tell me I was right.

05:05.202 --> 05:06.634
Because I will be.

05:06.669 --> 05:09.267
You're that sure of yourself?

05:09.302 --> 05:12.400
Marcie, I'd bet
my retirement property on it

05:12.435 --> 05:17.067
if the Army didn't
have it padlocked.

05:17.102 --> 05:20.200
Peggy, I cannot for the life
of me understand

05:20.235 --> 05:21.634
how you live with that man.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.801
Well, in Al's defense,

05:23.836 --> 05:27.367
what with overtime,
television, and the bathroom,

05:27.402 --> 05:29.634
I really don't
see him very much.

05:30.534 --> 05:32.467
See you later.

05:35.033 --> 05:37.767
Mom, big news down the block.

05:37.802 --> 05:40.067
The cops just arrested
these two guys

05:40.102 --> 05:42.300
trying to pull
the old asphalt scam.

05:42.335 --> 05:43.501
They what?

05:43.536 --> 05:45.100
Yeah, you know the one where
they offer

05:45.135 --> 05:46.367
to redo
your driveway real cheap,

05:46.402 --> 05:48.367
but they just use oil,

05:48.402 --> 05:51.400
so when it rains,
it all washes away.

05:51.435 --> 05:55.400
You have to be a real feeb
to fall for that one.

06:00.701 --> 06:02.167
Who are you calling?

06:02.202 --> 06:05.667
Al's mother. I told him
I'd invite her for the summer

06:05.702 --> 06:07.501
the next time he was right
about anything.

06:07.536 --> 06:09.400
Well, how do you think
he'll take it?

06:09.435 --> 06:10.467
Take what?

06:10.502 --> 06:12.267
<i>Hello?</i>

06:12.302 --> 06:15.067
My having to tell Al
he was right.

06:15.102 --> 06:18.033
You're not seriously
going to do that are you?

06:18.068 --> 06:19.133
<i>Hello?</i>

06:19.168 --> 06:21.033
Well, I have to.
He's bound to find out

06:21.068 --> 06:22.601
if he hasn't already.

06:22.636 --> 06:24.667
Marcie, let me
tell you something.

06:24.702 --> 06:26.000
<i>Peggy, is that you-?</i>

06:26.035 --> 06:29.968
In the 16 years that
I've been married to Al,

06:30.003 --> 06:31.968
I've learned there are certain
things never to ask for.

06:32.003 --> 06:35.300
<i>Never approach him for sex
during Wide World of Sports.</i>

06:35.335 --> 06:40.000
Oh, unless women's gymnastics
are on, then you got a shot.

06:40.035 --> 06:43.000
Never approach him
for sex in the morning.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.000
He thinks that
is just disgusting.

06:45.035 --> 06:47.467
And never ever
tell him he's right.

06:47.502 --> 06:48.601
Why?

06:48.636 --> 06:50.834
Because he's a man, Marcie.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.100
And the only thing uglier

06:52.135 --> 06:56.667
than a man who thinks
he's right is Al.

06:56.702 --> 06:59.534
Believe me, I know this
from experience.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.934
Let me tell you a story.

07:01.969 --> 07:03.334
A few years after
we were married

07:03.369 --> 07:06.033
I told Al that I could
hold up a fender

07:06.068 --> 07:08.167
so he could fix
the flat tire.

07:08.202 --> 07:12.033
He said, "No, let a man do it."
I said I could.

07:12.068 --> 07:14.534
So to make a long
story short,

07:14.569 --> 07:17.534
a man had to set
his leg that night.

07:17.569 --> 07:20.968
But, to this day, whenever I ask
Al to do something for me,

07:21.003 --> 07:22.167
that he doesn't want to do,

07:22.202 --> 07:24.467
he lifts up that leg
and says he can't

07:24.502 --> 07:26.467
and that it's my fault.

07:26.502 --> 07:29.467
The worst part
about it is, he's right.

07:29.502 --> 07:32.868
Marcie, don't let him
lift his leg on you.

07:40.667 --> 07:43.167
<i>Guess, I'll see you
tonight, Marce.</i>

07:43.202 --> 07:44.334
<i>What for?</i>

07:44.369 --> 07:46.267
<i>To tell me
I was right.</i>

07:46.302 --> 07:48.267
<i>You're not seriously
going to do that, are you?</i>

07:48.302 --> 07:51.334
<i>Tell me I was right.</i>

07:51.369 --> 07:52.834
<i>I was right.</i>

07:52.869 --> 07:54.367
Marcie, I'm back!

07:57.167 --> 07:58.667
Steve?

07:58.702 --> 08:02.167
I thought you weren't due back
till tomorrow night.

08:02.202 --> 08:03.534
I missed you.

08:06.701 --> 08:08.701
I'm sorry I didn't call.

08:08.736 --> 08:11.400
So you want
to fool around?

08:11.435 --> 08:13.868
Well, sure.

08:16.701 --> 08:19.067
I'm so glad to hear that.

08:32.634 --> 08:35.133
I haven't slept
in 18 hours.

08:35.168 --> 08:39.467
Oh, Steve's
not back yet.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.667
You have those
empty bed blues, huh?

08:41.702 --> 08:44.467
Well, yes and no.

08:44.502 --> 08:47.067
Peggy,
do you ever dream?

08:47.102 --> 08:50.367
Nah. Why dream,
when I have all this?

08:54.000 --> 08:57.000
No, I mean do you
ever have dreams?

08:57.035 --> 09:00.367
Nightmares? I had
a real doozy last night.

09:00.402 --> 09:01.868
What about?

09:01.903 --> 09:02.868
Al.

09:02.903 --> 09:04.033
Al?

09:04.068 --> 09:05.567
My Al?

09:05.602 --> 09:07.901
Yeah. See,
I was asleep-

09:07.936 --> 09:09.367
Did he have feet?

09:11.200 --> 09:12.400
Beg pardon?

09:12.435 --> 09:13.701
It's funny.

09:13.736 --> 09:16.701
In my dreams,
Al never has any feet.

09:16.736 --> 09:19.534
Oh, well. Go on.

09:19.569 --> 09:21.934
In my dream,
Steve came in

09:21.969 --> 09:27.167
and asked me if I wanted
to fool around.

09:27.202 --> 09:29.367
And when I said yes,
he turned and it was Al.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.501
My Al?

09:30.536 --> 09:32.601
Well, then what happened?

09:32.636 --> 09:33.767
Nothing.

09:33.802 --> 09:35.634
Yep, sounds like my Al.

09:38.334 --> 09:40.601
I hope you're
not upset, Peggy.

09:40.636 --> 09:43.100
About a dream?
Don't be silly.

09:43.135 --> 09:46.634
Plus, if you dreamed that
Al was in your bedroom,

09:46.669 --> 09:49.300
I should be
apologizing to you.

09:49.335 --> 09:50.334
Thanks, Peggy.

09:51.567 --> 09:54.067
Oh, but could you
do me a favor?

09:54.102 --> 09:56.534
Please don't
tell Al about this.

09:56.569 --> 09:58.033
Oh, don't worry.

09:58.068 --> 10:00.534
But could you do
something for me?

10:00.569 --> 10:03.033
If you ever dream
about Al again,

10:03.068 --> 10:06.033
could you check and see
if he has any feet?

10:06.068 --> 10:07.534
That really bothers me.

10:07.569 --> 10:08.801
Sure thing.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.734
Hi, Marce.
Hi, Peg.

10:11.769 --> 10:13.968
Bye, Peggy...Al.

10:17.901 --> 10:19.400
What's with her?

10:19.435 --> 10:22.567
She had a dream she slept
with you last night.

10:25.200 --> 10:26.567
Oh, yeah?

10:27.701 --> 10:29.067
She's a lucky gal.

10:34.534 --> 10:35.734
Marcie, I'm home.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.634
Steve?

10:38.669 --> 10:39.801
Yeah.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.467
Sorry I'm late, honey.

10:42.502 --> 10:45.467
The pro-penny people
pelted us with nickels.

10:47.534 --> 10:49.000
Did I wake you?

10:49.035 --> 10:51.334
Steve, it is you.

10:51.369 --> 10:52.834
Of course it's me.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.167
Give me a hug.

10:55.734 --> 10:57.234
Did you miss me?

10:57.269 --> 10:58.400
Mm-hmm.

10:58.435 --> 10:59.567
Don't worry.

10:59.602 --> 11:01.501
Daddy's home.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.434
And Daddy's going
to make it all better.

11:11.734 --> 11:13.367
Marcie, I'm home.

11:15.067 --> 11:19.200
Hon, you wouldn't believe
the traffic over O'Hare tonight.

11:22.334 --> 11:23.767
I swear...

11:23.802 --> 11:27.767
Someday that's where they're
going to find Amelia Earhart.

11:30.701 --> 11:31.734
But...

11:32.868 --> 11:34.534
The eagle has landed.

11:37.701 --> 11:39.634
You want to fool around?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.067
Pizza's here.

11:54.102 --> 11:57.234
Kelly, you know that's not
the way to hold a pizza.

11:57.269 --> 11:59.467
Mom, have you ever tried
to carry one of these things

11:59.502 --> 12:02.167
sitting on the back
of a Harley going 60

12:02.202 --> 12:04.267
while trying to hold
onto a fat guy

12:04.302 --> 12:06.234
who's wearing nothing
but chains and black leather.

12:06.269 --> 12:10.133
Yes, I have, and that is
not the way to do it.

12:13.767 --> 12:17.267
Mom, are we gonna do anything
different this summer?

12:17.302 --> 12:20.267
Well, Daddy got seats
for the ballgames again.

12:20.302 --> 12:21.434
Oh, puke.

12:21.469 --> 12:23.133
I thought
you liked the Cubs.

12:23.168 --> 12:25.133
I do, I just hate watching
them from the roof

12:25.168 --> 12:28.434
of that apartment building
where Dad always gets his seats.

12:28.469 --> 12:29.834
Well, honey, maybe someday
they'll forget about

12:29.869 --> 12:32.634
that fan interference call

12:32.669 --> 12:35.634
that kept the Cubs
out of the World Series

12:35.669 --> 12:38.167
and let Daddy back
into the stadium.

12:38.202 --> 12:40.367
I hope so,
because it looks so stupid

12:40.402 --> 12:43.634
with just us and the Polaskis
doing the wave.

12:52.734 --> 12:54.234
Marcie, you're a wreck.

12:54.269 --> 12:57.267
Oh, I see.

12:57.302 --> 12:58.767
Steve got back,

12:58.802 --> 13:02.767
and you two were at it
all night, huh?

13:02.802 --> 13:04.234
No.

13:04.269 --> 13:06.267
I had
that dream again...

13:06.302 --> 13:07.634
With Al.

13:10.767 --> 13:13.167
See, this is the part where
you're supposed to make a joke

13:13.202 --> 13:14.767
about Al being quick
in the sack

13:14.802 --> 13:16.167
so I can laugh
and see that

13:16.202 --> 13:17.534
you're not really mad
or anything.

13:17.569 --> 13:18.934
Marcie, that's two nights
in a row.

13:18.969 --> 13:22.100
Al hasn't been quick
in the sack with me

13:22.135 --> 13:24.667
for two nights
in a row in years.

13:24.702 --> 13:26.701
Hey, you think
I'm enjoying this?

13:26.736 --> 13:29.067
I was throwing up
all night.

13:29.102 --> 13:31.934
Well, so did I at first,
but it passes.

13:36.267 --> 13:39.100
Whatever happened to "It's only
a dream. Don't worry about it?"

13:39.135 --> 13:42.100
Peggy, can't you see what hell
my life's becoming?

13:42.135 --> 13:44.601
I haven't slept
in 48 hours.

13:44.636 --> 13:46.100
Steve's mad at me

13:46.135 --> 13:49.067
because every time
he brings up sex, I get sick.

13:49.102 --> 13:51.033
And now you're
yelling at me.

13:51.068 --> 13:52.534
And why not?

13:52.569 --> 13:55.501
You're the one dreaming
around with my husband.

13:55.536 --> 13:57.334
Hey, Peg.

13:57.369 --> 13:58.367
Ha!

14:00.534 --> 14:01.767
Hey, Marce.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.634
I tell you,
what a day.

14:13.267 --> 14:16.267
All day long,
it's pick up the shoes.

14:16.302 --> 14:19.267
Put down the shoes.
Pick up the shoes.

14:19.302 --> 14:22.767
Tomorrow ought to be
a good day for you.

14:22.802 --> 14:24.767
Tomorrow
I wash the car...

14:24.802 --> 14:26.634
in my t-shirt.

14:27.934 --> 14:31.601
I can't believe
you told him.

14:31.636 --> 14:33.467
I can't believe
you dream about him.

14:33.502 --> 14:35.467
I can't believe
everybody doesn't.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.834
I'm mortified.

14:39.869 --> 14:41.200
Well, get happy.

14:47.801 --> 14:50.734
Well, Peg, it looks
like another little filly

14:50.769 --> 14:52.601
in the old
Bundy stable.

14:53.734 --> 14:55.534
Get me a beer, will ya?

14:55.569 --> 14:58.167
Al, what are you doing
in Marcie's dream?

14:58.202 --> 15:00.534
Ruining her
for all other men.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.200
You are doing something
to cause those dreams.

15:05.235 --> 15:08.200
Now I don't know what it is,
but I want you to cut it out.

15:08.235 --> 15:10.501
I'll cut it out, Peg,
just tell me what to do.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.334
What should I do,
stop wearing t-shirts?

15:12.369 --> 15:16.000
Stop oozing sex
from every pore?

15:16.035 --> 15:19.267
That isn't sex, Al.

15:19.302 --> 15:21.300
What should I do, Peg?

15:21.335 --> 15:23.300
Well, you could
come upstairs

15:23.335 --> 15:26.300
and be my dreamlover
for a while.

15:26.335 --> 15:27.801
Peg, not tonight.

15:27.836 --> 15:30.167
This leg has
been acting up.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.601
Ever since that night
with the car...

15:34.636 --> 15:35.667
Fine, fine.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.100
Then let's discuss
who else's dreams

15:37.135 --> 15:40.100
you've been
gallivanting around in.

15:40.135 --> 15:42.601
Perhaps Mrs. Pritchard
across the street.

15:42.636 --> 15:46.601
I've seen how she looks
at you over her walker.

15:46.636 --> 15:48.400
If you think...

15:54.901 --> 15:56.934
* If you want my body *

15:56.969 --> 15:58.901
* And you think I'm sexy *

15:58.936 --> 16:02.100
* Come on, sugar
Let me know *

16:04.901 --> 16:07.200
* If you really
Need me *

16:07.235 --> 16:09.234
* Just reach out
And touch me **

16:09.269 --> 16:11.734
Steve, please.
I'm trying to read.

16:11.769 --> 16:13.601
You don't have to stop.

16:13.636 --> 16:15.501
Just get me a hammer
and I'll just nail

16:15.536 --> 16:16.434
that sucker to the ceiling.

16:17.734 --> 16:18.734
Steve!

16:18.769 --> 16:20.234
I have a question.

16:20.269 --> 16:21.968
Do you think
it's possible

16:22.003 --> 16:24.234
to dream that you're
interpreting a dream

16:24.269 --> 16:25.968
or must you be
awake to do this?

16:26.003 --> 16:27.968
And what are dreams anyway?

16:28.003 --> 16:30.534
Could we just be the dream
of some greater sleeping being?

16:30.569 --> 16:34.267
And if so, are we then
in fact real?

16:35.767 --> 16:37.467
I want sex, Marcie.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.133
I think I'm
getting nauseous.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.601
All right. That's it.

16:46.636 --> 16:50.834
Look, I've asked more
than a couple of women

16:50.869 --> 16:53.234
to go to bed with me
in my time.

16:53.269 --> 16:54.634
While I admit some
of their responses

16:54.669 --> 16:56.601
may have been somewhat cruel,

16:56.636 --> 17:02.167
not very many jumped up and
stuck their heads in the toilet.

17:02.202 --> 17:04.000
Now something strange
is going on here,

17:04.035 --> 17:06.300
and I demand
to know what it is.

17:06.335 --> 17:07.800
Don't toy with me, Marcie.

17:07.836 --> 17:10.666
I'm horny,
and I've been to Buffalo.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.800
Well...okay,
I'll tell you,

17:17.836 --> 17:21.300
but you have to promise
not to get angry.

17:21.335 --> 17:22.800
Fine.

17:22.836 --> 17:25.133
Well, it's
like this...

17:27.300 --> 17:28.267
<i>Al?!</i>

17:30.467 --> 17:32.100
And where are you
when I dream, huh?

17:32.135 --> 17:34.634
Where were you when
I dreamt I was drowning?

17:34.669 --> 17:36.267
How could I swim?

17:36.302 --> 17:38.701
You said I have no feet.

17:40.334 --> 17:43.200
If you loved me,
you would have paddled.

17:47.035 --> 17:48.334
Ah.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.267
Who is it?

17:51.302 --> 17:54.300
Steven
Bartholomew Rhoades.

17:56.601 --> 17:57.667
Bartholomew?

18:00.601 --> 18:04.968
Al, I'm horny. What are you
going to do about it?

18:08.801 --> 18:10.133
Get in there.

18:10.168 --> 18:12.133
Don't go yelling
things like that.

18:12.168 --> 18:14.133
I've got kids up there

18:14.168 --> 18:15.467
Or out there...

18:15.502 --> 18:17.000
Somewhere.
I don't know.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.501
Did she tell you, Steve?

18:20.536 --> 18:21.667
Yes, Peggy.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.801
He's an animal.

18:25.836 --> 18:29.167
I don't know what happened,
I go out of town for one day,

18:29.202 --> 18:31.300
I come back,
my wife's throwing up

18:31.335 --> 18:34.133
and dreaming she's sleeping
with your husband.

18:34.168 --> 18:37.834
I guess that's why they
call it the blues.

18:37.869 --> 18:39.834
I'm getting
out of here.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.834
You two can go on
blaming me

18:41.869 --> 18:44.834
for the dreams
of an insane woman.

18:44.869 --> 18:46.667
I'm going to a hotel.

18:46.702 --> 18:48.667
Better make it the Y.

18:48.702 --> 18:51.400
I don't want
any women to see me.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.133
Well, look who's here.
The dream weaver.

18:58.767 --> 19:01.767
Why can't you have
normal dreams like me?

19:01.802 --> 19:04.267
You know, where
you're Maharajah Bundy

19:04.302 --> 19:07.834
and women with four breasts
feed you ding dongs?

19:10.434 --> 19:12.167
Is Steve in there?

19:12.202 --> 19:14.968
No. There are no
other men in my dream.

19:15.003 --> 19:17.968
Just Phil Donahue, and we feed
him to the lizard people.

19:18.003 --> 19:21.334
No, I meant is Steve
in your house?

19:21.369 --> 19:22.634
Oh, yeah.

19:22.669 --> 19:24.801
He and Peg
want me dead.

19:24.836 --> 19:26.167
You just want me.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.467
Sit down, Al.

19:32.501 --> 19:35.100
You're not going to be looking
at my butt or anything, right?

19:35.135 --> 19:37.300
I think
I can guarantee that.

19:37.335 --> 19:38.834
Sit down, Al.

19:38.869 --> 19:39.834
All right.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.801
What is it?

19:44.836 --> 19:49.000
I know now why I was
having those dreams.

19:49.035 --> 19:52.434
Remember the driveway repavers
you said were gonna rip me off?

19:52.469 --> 19:55.434
They were, Al,
but I never told you.

19:55.469 --> 19:59.267
And the guilt I had manifested
itself in my dreams.

19:59.302 --> 20:00.767
I thought that-

20:00.802 --> 20:02.267
That I desired you?

20:02.302 --> 20:03.334
No, Al.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.400
I was being punished,

20:06.435 --> 20:10.767
much as sex with you
must actually be like.

20:10.802 --> 20:14.601
So now, in order to rid
myself of the guilt

20:14.636 --> 20:16.601
and those horrible,
horrible dreams,

20:16.636 --> 20:19.534
I've come to say
you were right.

20:19.569 --> 20:21.300
You hear that, Al?

20:21.335 --> 20:23.634
You were right,
and I was wrong.

20:23.669 --> 20:26.467
You're the man,
and I'm the woman.

20:26.502 --> 20:29.300
And in this case,
the man was right.

20:29.335 --> 20:32.133
The man knew better
than the woman.

20:32.168 --> 20:34.167
The woman should have
listened to the man.

20:34.202 --> 20:35.968
Satisfied, Al? Is that
what you want to hear?

20:36.003 --> 20:37.968
Wait a second,
hold on a second.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.834
You didn't desire me?

20:41.801 --> 20:45.167
You didn't
even have feet.

20:47.133 --> 20:50.067
Marcie, I thought
I heard you out here.

20:50.102 --> 20:51.400
What's going on?

20:51.435 --> 20:54.367
Nothing. Just purging
myself, that's all.

20:54.402 --> 20:56.934
Oh, honey, not again.

20:56.969 --> 20:58.267
Not that.

20:58.302 --> 20:59.934
Everything's fine now.

20:59.969 --> 21:01.767
Let's go home.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.934
You mean home as in...

21:03.969 --> 21:06.467
Last one up has
to read the ceiling.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.067
I'm going
to have sex, Al.

21:17.267 --> 21:18.767
What's everybody
talking about?

21:18.802 --> 21:20.133
I got feet.

21:24.601 --> 21:26.968
Al, Steve and I
were talking

21:27.003 --> 21:29.601
about you being in
Marcie's dream, and...

21:29.636 --> 21:33.300
I was right about it
being stupid to blame me.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.434
You're not gonna lord this
over me, are you?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.567
Sure, I am, Peg.

21:38.602 --> 21:40.400
Well, I'm going up
to bed now.

21:40.435 --> 21:41.334
Good.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.434
Why don't you come
on up and show me

21:46.469 --> 21:49.067
what dreams
are really made of?

21:49.102 --> 21:51.934
I'll be up in
a little bit, Peg.

22:01.767 --> 22:04.033
Well, at least
it's all over.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.267
Al!

22:08.302 --> 22:09.934
Al, you coming up?

22:09.969 --> 22:13.300
I said I'd be
up in a second, Peg.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.467
I said
I'd be right up.

22:29.767 --> 22:31.934
Well, don't
wait too long...

22:31.969 --> 22:33.501
tiger.
