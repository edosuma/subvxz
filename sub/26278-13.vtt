01:00.522 --> 01:03.079
- Kinetoscope number three.
- Right over here.

01:03.131 --> 01:04.974
It will be one penny.

01:17.420 --> 01:19.373
_

01:29.072 --> 01:30.783
No!

01:31.610 --> 01:33.367
Ah!

01:45.203 --> 01:48.081
- Shot, you think?
- Hmm...

01:48.128 --> 01:50.338
More likely stabbed,

01:51.409 --> 01:55.112
- with something narrow.
- A letter opener?

01:55.237 --> 01:56.934
Possibly.

02:05.618 --> 02:07.630
_

02:07.755 --> 02:09.251
Sir.

02:11.271 --> 02:13.756
A fingermark. In some blood.

02:14.543 --> 02:16.549
It's likely a thumbmark.

02:19.853 --> 02:21.716
Less than 24 hours old.

02:21.788 --> 02:23.731
- We'll compare it to the ones we have on file.
- Excuse me, please.

02:23.755 --> 02:25.696
You can't go in there, sir.

02:26.601 --> 02:29.440
I am here to see Detective Murdoch.

02:33.008 --> 02:34.851
Mr. Tesla.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.424
It appears we are to renew
our acquaintance, Detective.

02:38.476 --> 02:41.711
Once again under tragic circumstances.

02:42.724 --> 02:44.606
What do you know of this, Mr. Tesla?

02:44.638 --> 02:46.574
His name is Julius Bosworth.

02:46.647 --> 02:49.591
- He was an inventor like me.
- Did you know him well?

02:49.664 --> 02:53.090
We were engaged in a correspondence.
He was seeking advice.

02:53.137 --> 02:55.138
His investor was about to pull out.

02:55.239 --> 02:57.523
Alas, I was in same boat.

02:57.554 --> 02:59.617
Yes. I read that you had lost funding

02:59.638 --> 03:02.486
- for your Long Island experiments.
- I seek a better world.

03:02.544 --> 03:04.815
J.P. Morgan seeks only money.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.863
So I could only advise
as to methods and theory.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.874
What are you doing here?

03:11.268 --> 03:12.972
He said he was close to success

03:12.999 --> 03:14.898
and wanted me to share in it.

03:15.023 --> 03:16.985
Instead, when I arrived he was dead

03:16.996 --> 03:19.215
and some of his equipment
had been removed.

03:20.007 --> 03:21.927
What was he working on?

03:22.333 --> 03:27.748
Mr. Bosworth was working on a
device to render objects invisible.

03:35.899 --> 03:38.390
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Ah, Inspector!

03:38.404 --> 03:40.216
Welcome back! How was New York?

03:40.242 --> 03:43.951
- Too hot. Too crowded. Too bloody big.
- Glad to be home, then?

03:43.982 --> 03:47.528
A man's got to earn a living,
Crabtree. And I'm not exactly home.

03:47.576 --> 03:49.951
I've taken a flat in a
house further down my street.

03:49.989 --> 03:51.890
Sir, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:51.934 --> 03:53.734
Eh. Where's Murdoch?

03:53.781 --> 03:56.928
Sir, he's at the scene of
a murder with Nikola Tesla.

03:56.986 --> 04:00.274
Field equations. I assume
you would understand.

04:00.302 --> 04:03.821
Yes, he was working on the
problem of magnetic resonance.

04:05.384 --> 04:07.105
These are my letters.

04:10.882 --> 04:13.506
August 22nd. Two weeks ago.

04:13.553 --> 04:16.249
Yes. I believe that was
the last one I wrote.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.237
- Is that blood?
- I believe so.

04:39.589 --> 04:43.544
It's been here for some time. I
don't believe it's from the murder.

04:43.785 --> 04:45.301
Invisibility?

04:45.542 --> 04:48.202
You're having me on. That's impossible.

04:48.485 --> 04:51.783
- Isn't it?
- Air is invisible. Glass and water almost.

04:51.832 --> 04:54.974
- Why?
- No theory accounts for it.

04:55.254 --> 04:58.189
You are not familiar with the
journal Annalan Der Physik?

04:58.909 --> 05:01.337
- I don't read German.
- You must.

05:01.353 --> 05:04.228
A recent article has solved the problem.

05:04.353 --> 05:07.076
See, light can be understood
as packets of energy

05:07.113 --> 05:11.048
that are either absorbed
or reflected by atoms.

05:11.173 --> 05:14.494
If these atoms could be
magnetically realigned,

05:14.851 --> 05:18.434
packets of specific energy
will pass through unperturbed.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.679
Rendering the object invisible.

05:20.873 --> 05:23.391
And that's what this Bosworth
fellow was trying to do?

05:23.406 --> 05:24.781
Precisely.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.847
It's all bollocks if you ask me.

05:26.972 --> 05:28.798
Uh, Sirs.

05:28.992 --> 05:31.306
Miss Hart has some results for you, sir.

05:31.327 --> 05:35.803
- Oh, very good. Mr. Tesla, care to join me?
- Of course.

05:37.191 --> 05:39.972
What's your opinion on this
invisibility business, Crabtree?

05:39.988 --> 05:42.920
- Or need I ask.
- Sir, frankly, it disturbs me.

05:42.941 --> 05:44.772
I can see how it might
be to my advantage

05:44.804 --> 05:45.994
to make certain objects invisible.

05:46.005 --> 05:47.747
Things I don't want
other people to steal.

05:47.807 --> 05:50.790
But what happens if you've
forgotten what you've done with it?

05:50.810 --> 05:53.324
You'd never find it again.
And next thing you know,

05:53.345 --> 05:54.635
we're all tripping
over invisible objects

05:54.646 --> 05:56.162
other people have left lying around.

05:56.287 --> 05:59.084
Sir, what happens if you're walking
down the road and there's a hole,

05:59.116 --> 06:01.907
someone's made it invisible,
you fall in and break your leg?

06:02.263 --> 06:03.837
An invisible hole?

06:05.978 --> 06:09.424
- Julia, you remember...
- Mr. Tesla!

06:09.482 --> 06:10.987
How wonderful to see you again.

06:11.024 --> 06:13.841
- And you, Doctor.
- Are you in town long?

06:13.851 --> 06:15.846
Until we can solve the
murder of my colleague.

06:15.935 --> 06:18.651
Oh yes, I heard. How terrible.

06:18.693 --> 06:21.311
We're off to the morgue,
actually, if you'd care to join?

06:21.348 --> 06:24.685
Actually, I'm here to see Constable
Crabtree for writing advice.

06:25.456 --> 06:27.202
Good idea.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.154
Am I interrupting, George?

06:34.279 --> 06:37.453
Well, I've been charged
with matching the fingermarks

06:37.469 --> 06:39.182
found at the crime scene
with those in our files.

06:39.206 --> 06:41.170
And while the Detective's
classification system does...

06:41.194 --> 06:42.715
If it's a bad time...

06:42.757 --> 06:45.936
Doctor, you would be
relieving me of a great tedium.

06:46.912 --> 06:50.688
Well, I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

06:51.003 --> 06:53.196
giving our manuscript a quick read.

06:53.212 --> 06:54.854
It's done then, is it?

06:55.074 --> 06:58.376
Well, writing is never
quite done, is it?

06:58.379 --> 07:00.583
Always room to improve.

07:01.758 --> 07:04.097
I've managed to liven up the forensics,

07:04.113 --> 07:06.793
but I'm afraid William's
portion is a bit dry.

07:06.918 --> 07:09.621
He does tend to be... precise.

07:09.646 --> 07:13.030
He thinks that our book is an
investigative manual and that's that!

07:13.629 --> 07:16.661
So I was wondering...

07:18.145 --> 07:22.058
- I can... have a look and provide some thoughts.
- Wonderful.

07:22.551 --> 07:26.061
Or, if you'd like to try your
hand at... improving it...

07:26.071 --> 07:29.125
- Doctor, I don't know about that...
- Anything you can manage.

07:29.869 --> 07:31.943
It would be greatly appreciated.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.719
He was stabbed in the left ventricle.

07:41.766 --> 07:43.750
The entry wound was very small.

07:44.169 --> 07:45.833
A screwdriver, perhaps?

07:46.100 --> 07:47.947
That would be my guess.

07:48.072 --> 07:49.888
The depth of the wound was four inches

07:49.898 --> 07:51.661
but the shaft could have been longer.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.209
Have you established the time of death?

07:54.334 --> 07:56.182
Between 10:30 and midnight.

08:00.274 --> 08:02.057
- George!
- Sir!

08:02.446 --> 08:06.153
Have you found a match for the
fingermark we found at the scene yet?

08:06.278 --> 08:07.780
Sir, I'm working on that right now.

08:07.822 --> 08:09.469
George, we classified that fingermark

08:09.511 --> 08:11.437
as a right thumb Reverse whorl-3.

08:11.468 --> 08:13.671
There can't be more than a
dozen comparables in there.

08:13.703 --> 08:16.861
Sir, I apologize. I fell asleep.

08:17.401 --> 08:20.725
Sir, a woman has just reported
Professor Bosworth missing.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.224
Please show her to my office, Henry.

08:26.649 --> 08:29.587
- Please, have a seat, Miss...
- Rossini.

08:29.668 --> 08:31.549
Fiona Rossini.

08:32.730 --> 08:35.999
I'm Detective William
Murdoch. This is Mr. Tesla.

08:36.067 --> 08:38.727
- Nikola Tesla?
- Oh, you have heard of me?

08:39.183 --> 08:41.412
Professor Bosworth talked about you.

08:41.513 --> 08:43.774
How is it you know Professor Bosworth?

08:43.794 --> 08:46.570
We live in the same house.
I have the flat below him.

08:46.748 --> 08:49.319
I haven't seen him in days
and I'm worried about him.

08:49.681 --> 08:50.977
Why is that?

08:51.050 --> 08:52.589
Because he came to
see me the other night

08:52.613 --> 08:54.418
and he was bleeding quite badly.

08:54.491 --> 08:57.550
He said he had cut himself
at work. He's always working.

08:58.169 --> 09:00.504
- When was this?
- Night before last.

09:00.556 --> 09:02.009
No, sorry.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.443
The night before the night before last.

09:04.653 --> 09:06.877
- So, three nights ago.
- Uh-huh.

09:06.903 --> 09:10.470
That could explain the bloody
rags we found in the laboratory.

09:10.769 --> 09:13.778
What did Professor Bosworth
come to see you about?

09:14.059 --> 09:16.530
He had a box he wanted me to keep.

09:16.715 --> 09:18.383
- A box?
- Mm-hmm.

09:18.508 --> 09:20.931
About this big. Made of wood.

09:21.056 --> 09:23.788
He said he wanted me to keep it
in case anyone tried to steal it.

09:23.817 --> 09:26.813
I said: "Professor, you're
bleeding!" He said it was nothing.

09:26.859 --> 09:28.811
But it bled a lot!

09:29.373 --> 09:31.162
That was the last I saw of him.

09:33.585 --> 09:36.601
Oh! I don't know if I want to do this.

09:36.638 --> 09:39.906
He was such a nice man and I've
never seen anyone dead before.

09:46.543 --> 09:48.279
That's not Professor Bosworth.

09:48.531 --> 09:50.409
- It's not?
- No.

09:50.744 --> 09:53.566
The Professor is balding
with a moustache and

09:53.734 --> 09:57.270
not terribly handsome. Though
don't say that I said that.

09:57.338 --> 10:00.176
Oh, I'm so relieved!

10:00.574 --> 10:03.345
Though I suppose I
shouldn't be too happy.

10:03.554 --> 10:06.110
After all, this fellow's dead
and you don't even know who it is.

10:06.136 --> 10:09.095
Miss Rossini, we'll be needing
to have a look at that box.

10:09.126 --> 10:12.637
Oh no, I can't give that
to anyone. He was adamant.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.614
As am I, Miss Rossini.

10:14.824 --> 10:16.665
So it wasn't Professor Bosworth?

10:16.712 --> 10:18.926
Apparently I had made
an erroneous assumption.

10:18.978 --> 10:21.507
Which means we still need
to identify our victim.

10:21.559 --> 10:22.986
I'll contact the other Station Houses,

10:23.002 --> 10:24.426
see if anyone has been reported missing.

10:24.450 --> 10:26.653
Also see that his
photograph is distributed.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.748
Oh, and find out what you
can about Madventure Capital.

10:29.873 --> 10:31.002
Sir.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.769
Sir, I found a match for
our bloody fingermark.

10:35.813 --> 10:38.263
An ex-convict by the
name of Sam Marshall.

10:38.279 --> 10:39.978
Very good. Bring him in.

10:58.209 --> 11:01.194
- Is this Bosworth, then?
- I believe it is, sir.

11:07.157 --> 11:09.124
No, it can't be.

11:12.844 --> 11:14.271
Bloody hell.

11:14.396 --> 11:16.211
It really is invisible.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.098
So apparently not bollocks.

11:27.049 --> 11:30.401
- I knew it could work! I knew it!
- Or it's a trick.

11:30.438 --> 11:33.207
Why would Bosworth do that? He
is a scientist, not a charlatan.

11:33.228 --> 11:36.140
More to the point, why was he trying
to hide this film, and from who?

11:36.166 --> 11:38.662
- Whom.
- I don't know.

11:38.787 --> 11:41.102
And who's the dead
body in Bosworth's lab?

11:41.227 --> 11:42.654
I don't know,

11:42.890 --> 11:45.146
but I wonder if the man who
left the bloody fingermark

11:45.167 --> 11:47.217
will have an answer to that question.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.124
You're wasting your time.

11:53.249 --> 11:55.407
To the contrary, Mr. Marshall.

11:55.889 --> 11:59.184
You left a bloody fingermark
at the scene of the crime

11:59.194 --> 12:01.655
which matches exactly the fingermarks

12:01.676 --> 12:03.360
we have on file for you.

12:03.601 --> 12:05.143
All right, I was there.

12:05.610 --> 12:07.064
But I didn't kill him.

12:07.756 --> 12:09.403
Didn't kill who?

12:10.243 --> 12:12.084
Whoever you think I did.

12:14.262 --> 12:16.968
Perhaps this will jog your memory.

12:18.776 --> 12:20.299
That's not the man I...

12:21.207 --> 12:22.964
That's the man...

12:24.202 --> 12:25.916
Please, continue.

12:26.017 --> 12:27.927
I've got nothing to say.

12:28.746 --> 12:31.568
Mr. Marshall, I have
enough here to hang you

12:31.589 --> 12:33.241
for the murder of this man.

12:33.315 --> 12:35.628
- Yeah, but I didn't...
- Who is he?

12:35.681 --> 12:37.838
- I don't know his name.
- But you recognized him.

12:38.115 --> 12:41.477
You said he was the man who... what?

12:41.535 --> 12:43.003
What did he do?

12:46.581 --> 12:49.062
Mr. Marshall. If we
end this interview now,

12:49.073 --> 12:51.522
you will hang for the
murder of this man.

12:53.992 --> 12:56.867
- Constable, Mr. Marshall doesn't seem...
- He hired me.

12:58.493 --> 12:59.946
To do what?

13:02.904 --> 13:04.882
Did he hire you

13:05.056 --> 13:07.391
to kill this man two days ago?

13:07.883 --> 13:09.436
I've said all I'm gonna say.

13:09.460 --> 13:11.551
Because if he did, you will
be interested in knowing

13:11.566 --> 13:13.497
that you did not succeed.

13:14.478 --> 13:17.306
- He's alive?
- He's wounded, but not fatally.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.965
The charge will be attempted murder.

13:20.516 --> 13:23.517
So you'll escape the
noose, if you confess.

13:24.828 --> 13:26.780
I was hired by him to kill him.

13:27.813 --> 13:29.214
- Why?
- I don't know.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.354
I didn't ask.

13:31.910 --> 13:34.934
- So you stabbed him.
- Maybe.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.637
- Yes.
- And you left him for dead in his laboratory.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.079
Yes.

13:45.112 --> 13:46.570
Who is this man?

13:47.116 --> 13:48.626
I don't know his name.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.808
I'm not lying!

13:51.107 --> 13:52.634
But I know who knows him.

13:52.639 --> 13:55.326
I've seen him once before
with Simon and Ted Alvin.

13:55.373 --> 13:57.340
The sons of Percival Alvin.

13:57.639 --> 14:00.026
- The banker?
- How do you know them?

14:00.645 --> 14:02.984
I've done a few odd jobs for 'em.

14:04.682 --> 14:06.326
So we don't know who the dead man is,

14:06.347 --> 14:08.404
only that he hired this
chap to kill Bosworth.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.132
Is it possible that Bosworth
figured it out and took revenge?

14:11.174 --> 14:13.151
If he did, I would not blame him.

14:13.324 --> 14:17.080
I'd like to know who hired someone
to kill Professor Bosworth and why.

14:17.379 --> 14:21.875
Henry, please bring in Simon and
Theodore Alvin for questioning.

14:21.876 --> 14:23.250
Right away, sir.

14:23.476 --> 14:25.123
Look at this.

14:26.379 --> 14:29.054
- Buggalugs!
- Sir!

14:33.891 --> 14:37.316
- This is...
- Perhaps we could have a word in your office.

14:40.543 --> 14:44.897
Dr. Ogden asked that I
read it and give advice.

14:45.022 --> 14:47.676
Did she ask you to rewrite any aspect?

14:47.697 --> 14:50.377
She seemed to suggest that
if I had any specific thoughts

14:50.398 --> 14:52.161
I might include them.

14:52.286 --> 14:53.735
I understand.

14:53.777 --> 14:55.832
She wants it to be entertaining.

14:56.652 --> 14:57.968
Sir...

14:58.604 --> 15:00.151
She's not wrong.

15:00.214 --> 15:01.662
For example,

15:01.682 --> 15:03.906
that you map out your thoughts
on a blackboard is interesting,

15:03.922 --> 15:06.493
but as far as a technical assessment

15:06.530 --> 15:08.749
of the physical properties of chalk,

15:09.021 --> 15:13.385
perhaps that would be best
consigned to some sort of appendix.

15:13.510 --> 15:18.664
- I suppose if it's properly footnoted.
- Sir, it's not just that.

15:20.427 --> 15:23.364
This is the dullest thing
I've ever read in my life.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.287
And I've read telephone
books. At your insistence.

15:26.313 --> 15:28.947
George. The purpose of this
book is not to entertain.

15:28.989 --> 15:30.489
It is to educate.

15:30.573 --> 15:34.707
Yes, but sir, surely for one to
be educated, one must remain awake.

15:34.775 --> 15:37.613
I dare say if I was pitched
in battle with a lion

15:37.623 --> 15:39.418
and this was read aloud to a bullhorn,

15:39.455 --> 15:41.790
I might make it to the end
with just a couple of yawns,

15:41.805 --> 15:44.801
but after lunch, sitting
at my desk, impossible.

15:45.425 --> 15:49.633
Yes, well, Dr. Ogden's solution
is to inject her writing with puns.

15:49.638 --> 15:51.768
Oh, her jokes are terrible, sir!

15:51.789 --> 15:53.420
Your writing makes me
want to fall asleep.

15:53.436 --> 15:56.164
Hers makes me want to
light this document on fire

15:56.190 --> 15:57.711
for the good of humanity.

16:00.097 --> 16:02.411
No, that's all right, George.

16:02.632 --> 16:05.375
The truth hurts, but
the truth is necessary.

16:05.789 --> 16:08.176
But that's just it,
sir, it's not all bad.

16:08.224 --> 16:11.484
I just think you're missing
some of the best parts.

16:11.497 --> 16:14.440
I mean, instead of giving
us detailed instructions

16:14.461 --> 16:16.838
on how to build a
transmitter and receiver,

16:16.843 --> 16:18.527
tell us the story behind it.

16:18.590 --> 16:21.611
How, years ago, you and Mr.
Tesla built such a device

16:21.612 --> 16:25.305
that elicited an actual
confession to a real murder.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.177
That would really be something.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.020
I mean, the bits and bobs
of its actual construction

16:30.036 --> 16:32.171
could be left to...

16:32.596 --> 16:34.154
The appendix.

16:34.568 --> 16:36.992
Or a separate volume altogether.

16:46.377 --> 16:48.229
- Simon Alvin.
- That's me.

16:48.279 --> 16:51.455
- And you're Theodore Alvin.
- I go by Ted.

16:53.501 --> 16:56.219
Do either of you know this man?

16:56.455 --> 16:57.766
No.

16:57.866 --> 17:01.298
- Never seen him.
- Does the name Professor Bosworth mean anything?

17:01.959 --> 17:03.448
Never heard of him.

17:05.305 --> 17:07.529
- What about this man?
- Oh my Lord!

17:07.545 --> 17:08.836
- My God, he's...
- Dead.

17:08.857 --> 17:10.608
- How?
- Why? Why did this happen?

17:10.656 --> 17:13.388
- Who is he?
- Adam Bester.

17:13.513 --> 17:14.643
He was a friend.

17:14.768 --> 17:18.132
Well, your friend hired a
former employee of your father's

17:18.190 --> 17:19.994
to kill this man.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.481
- We don't know anything about that.
- We?

17:22.906 --> 17:24.747
How do you know what he knows?

17:24.872 --> 17:28.050
- Are you two in cahoots over this?
- Not at all.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.787
If they're not in cahoots,

17:32.803 --> 17:34.408
they still know more
than they're letting on.

17:34.424 --> 17:37.514
I agree. Ah, gentlemen.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.477
Tomorrow I want you to determine
our victim's last steps,

17:40.498 --> 17:43.478
as well as any connection he may
have had to Professor Bosworth

17:43.520 --> 17:45.681
and Simon and Theodore Alvin.

17:45.806 --> 17:48.683
Right. I'm off. Good evening, gentlemen.

18:34.991 --> 18:36.753
Verna Jones.

18:37.055 --> 18:39.673
Welcome to the neighbourhood, Tommy.

18:40.638 --> 18:43.109
I'm still on the same
street. Please, do come in.

18:43.127 --> 18:45.102
You've just moved in.

18:45.429 --> 18:48.198
You require... hospitality.

18:49.184 --> 18:51.565
And evidently a woman's touch.

18:58.973 --> 19:00.594
Is that La Boheme?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.644
You've got an Edison!

19:04.880 --> 19:06.648
My treat to myself.

19:06.721 --> 19:08.662
Margaret didn't care for opera.

19:08.709 --> 19:10.346
Oh, poor you.

19:10.471 --> 19:14.485
My Jack loved opera. He'd wear his
top hat, I'd get all dressed up...

19:16.484 --> 19:18.252
This is a meat pie.

19:18.377 --> 19:21.609
You can eat it cold or heat it up.

19:21.636 --> 19:24.374
- Thank you.
- You know how to light the stove?

19:24.435 --> 19:26.509
It's just a stove.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.917
It's a gas stove.

19:29.447 --> 19:31.775
Jack bought me one last year.

19:31.876 --> 19:35.459
- You have to light the pilot first.
- The what?

19:35.669 --> 19:37.368
The pilot.

19:38.161 --> 19:39.985
The stove top you can light directly,

19:40.017 --> 19:43.039
but the oven, you have
to light the pilot first.

19:43.096 --> 19:45.935
- Or what?
- Your apartment blows up.

19:46.665 --> 19:50.069
If I hear an explosion, I'll
know you didn't take my advice.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.987
We must do something about this.

20:06.395 --> 20:09.855
So, when this package of light energy

20:09.894 --> 20:11.599
hits an atom,

20:11.636 --> 20:13.561
it dislodges an electron.

20:13.686 --> 20:16.447
Which would explain the
photoelectric effect.

20:16.572 --> 20:19.710
But if the atoms are
realigned with magnets...

20:19.725 --> 20:22.904
Resonating magnetic
field, to be precise.

20:22.961 --> 20:26.481
Well, then the light
simply passes right through.

20:26.606 --> 20:28.055
That is correct.

20:28.128 --> 20:29.881
That's fantastic.

20:30.143 --> 20:31.801
Who proposed this theory?

20:31.902 --> 20:34.414
A man by the name of Einsteen.

20:34.539 --> 20:38.196
Albert. No, Alfred.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.283
He's written a few articles of late.

20:40.294 --> 20:44.134
The last one was: On the
Electro-Dynamics of Moving Bodies.

20:44.144 --> 20:45.388
That sounds fascinating.

20:45.393 --> 20:47.523
It is not as intriguing
as the title suggests.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.165
All about matter and energy

20:49.176 --> 20:51.772
and its relationship
to the speed of light.

20:55.216 --> 20:57.798
It has no practical value.

20:58.433 --> 21:01.318
Do you recall our first conversation?

21:01.764 --> 21:06.412
We speculated on the possibility
of converting light energy

21:06.438 --> 21:08.757
into a modulated electrical signal

21:08.767 --> 21:11.831
- which could be transmitted and then received.
- Of course.

21:11.842 --> 21:14.418
We called it tele-vision.

21:15.199 --> 21:18.531
It sounds as though this Einsteen fellow

21:18.557 --> 21:21.253
has described its underlying theory.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.830
We should build it.

21:25.675 --> 21:29.127
I have a murder case to
solve first, Mr. Tesla.

21:29.169 --> 21:32.579
I will acquire the necessary materials.

21:41.162 --> 21:43.780
Sir. I checked into Madventure Capital.

21:43.785 --> 21:45.842
They specialize in
risky commercial loans.

21:46.183 --> 21:48.401
How is our victim,
Mr. Bester, connected?

21:48.417 --> 21:50.888
He owned it, along with
Ted and Simon Alvin.

21:51.423 --> 21:53.306
Odd that they didn't mention that.

21:53.343 --> 21:56.354
Who wants to bet their company
invested in Bosworth's invention?

21:56.574 --> 21:57.970
Bring them back in, Henry.

21:58.043 --> 22:00.866
And George, did you find out
about our victim's last movements?

22:00.897 --> 22:02.492
Sir, I spoke to the maid,

22:02.502 --> 22:05.624
she said he received some
sort of distressing phone call,

22:05.640 --> 22:08.945
left for an arcade off Yonge
St. She never saw him again.

22:11.035 --> 22:12.228
Yes.

22:12.302 --> 22:14.746
He was here a few days
ago. Asked for machine 3.

22:15.114 --> 22:16.829
What's on machine 3?

22:17.579 --> 22:20.710
It used to be a dog doing
tricks, but it's been changed.

22:20.736 --> 22:22.032
What is it now?

22:22.273 --> 22:24.392
It's hard to explain.
It needs to be seen.

22:24.670 --> 22:27.216
Although, there is a bit of a wait.

22:27.230 --> 22:29.087
It is our most popular film.

22:29.439 --> 22:31.028
I'll see it now.

22:31.679 --> 22:33.247
Of course.

22:35.726 --> 22:37.188
Excuse me.

22:43.152 --> 22:45.424
_

23:03.254 --> 23:06.134
_

23:10.651 --> 23:14.465
I'm sorry, but I'm drawing the
line. An invisible man is impossible.

23:14.691 --> 23:18.881
It could be possible if he's
realigning his constituent atoms.

23:18.914 --> 23:21.097
But, sir, how is he eating or drinking?

23:21.150 --> 23:22.381
I mean, should we be on the lookout

23:22.393 --> 23:24.714
for undigested porridge
floating about in midair?

23:24.722 --> 23:27.082
That's the other thing I don't
like about this invisibility.

23:27.413 --> 23:29.023
Perhaps he's fasting.

23:29.028 --> 23:32.384
Or realigning his constituent
atoms after every meal.

23:32.678 --> 23:35.673
There is equipment missing
from the lab. That could be why.

23:35.705 --> 23:39.486
So an invisible killer is
running amok. Excellent.

23:41.250 --> 23:42.420
What have you, George?

23:42.545 --> 23:45.933
- Sir, we've not been able to locate Simon Alvin.
- And Theodore?

23:47.451 --> 23:50.216
He was killed in the
same manner as Mr. Bester.

23:50.294 --> 23:52.456
Small piercing wound to the heart.

23:52.581 --> 23:54.302
Screwdriver?

23:54.610 --> 23:56.844
That was my guess.

23:57.094 --> 23:59.449
So Bosworth is going
after them one at a time.

23:59.728 --> 24:01.081
Where's Tweedledee?

24:01.118 --> 24:04.396
Simon Alvin discovered his
brother's body and fled the scene.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.253
We haven't been able to locate him.

24:06.714 --> 24:08.341
Thank you.

24:14.159 --> 24:16.168
_

24:16.588 --> 24:19.080
Gift. From a friend.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.310
So is the brother a suspect, then?

24:22.688 --> 24:25.101
No, but very likely the next victim.

24:25.138 --> 24:27.693
- We need to bring him in.
- So how are you going to find him?

24:27.703 --> 24:29.780
If he's hiding from an invisible man,

24:29.833 --> 24:32.561
he's hiding from you too.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.476
Not necessarily.

24:42.392 --> 24:43.924
We both received telegrams

24:43.945 --> 24:46.280
to go to Plimley's Arcade
and watch machine 3.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.729
Mr. Alvin, please, have a seat.

24:48.997 --> 24:51.899
- He could have slipped in here ahead of us.
- Who?

24:52.000 --> 24:53.361
Bosworth, of course.

24:53.398 --> 24:55.995
He intends to kill us all
with an invisible screwdriver.

24:56.404 --> 24:57.862
Why would he do that?

24:57.935 --> 25:01.618
Because we had plans to discontinue
our investment in his projects.

25:02.451 --> 25:05.410
- Why?
- Because we didn't think it was going to work.

25:05.609 --> 25:07.690
- Well, it does.
- Clearly.

25:08.062 --> 25:09.384
Please...

25:11.498 --> 25:13.272
So Professor Bosworth

25:13.329 --> 25:15.590
planned to kill you because

25:15.617 --> 25:19.089
you had lost faith in a project
he knew to be successful.

25:19.530 --> 25:22.877
So why not simply
demonstrate its feasibility

25:22.903 --> 25:24.681
and secure financing elsewhere?

25:24.686 --> 25:26.848
Who knows? The man is clearly a lunatic.

25:26.879 --> 25:29.529
So, you had no idea
that the project worked

25:29.560 --> 25:32.099
until you saw the film
at the arcade today?

25:32.224 --> 25:35.844
- Yes.
- Then how did you know about the invisible screwdriver?

25:37.061 --> 25:39.612
That wasn't on the kinetoscope reel.

25:40.655 --> 25:43.337
That was part of this film.

25:43.646 --> 25:47.519
Which Bosworth used to show
you that his device worked.

25:47.735 --> 25:51.257
But instead of ramping
up your investment,

25:51.323 --> 25:54.286
- you conspired to kill him.
- That is total speculation.

25:54.312 --> 25:55.859
I'm not going to stand
for it. You can charge me

25:55.869 --> 25:58.456
with whatever you will. I
will make my case in court.

25:59.064 --> 26:00.108
You're right.

26:00.187 --> 26:02.642
I don't yet have enough
evidence to hold you.

26:02.889 --> 26:05.702
- You're free to go.
- No. If I leave, he's going to kill me.

26:05.733 --> 26:08.314
Then give me a reason
to keep you in here.

26:10.921 --> 26:14.666
Professor Bosworth had plans
to stage a public demonstration

26:14.682 --> 26:17.075
in order to secure more
funding for his project.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.254
What he failed to realise
is that invisibility is...

26:20.379 --> 26:23.055
most valuable when
no one knows about it.

26:23.180 --> 26:24.592
Ah.

26:24.693 --> 26:27.886
Hard to keep secrets from
someone you don't know is there.

26:27.949 --> 26:31.295
State secrets. Industrial secrets.

26:31.951 --> 26:34.264
We would have been the
richest men in the world.

26:35.072 --> 26:37.296
But first you had to kill him.

26:37.421 --> 26:40.701
But we didn't succeed. So protect me.

26:45.899 --> 26:48.438
- Mr. Tesla?
- Ah!

26:49.131 --> 26:52.195
It is called a Nipkow disk.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.390
It is perforated in such a way

26:55.405 --> 26:59.099
that, as it turns, it sweeps
past every point in an image.

27:03.049 --> 27:07.760
As it does, the light
produces a modulated current

27:07.787 --> 27:11.774
that can be transmitted
by wire to a receiver.

27:12.004 --> 27:15.015
Or recorded onto a wax cylinder.

27:15.193 --> 27:18.451
I would contend magnetic
wire is superior.

27:20.782 --> 27:23.393
My problem is how to modulate

27:23.414 --> 27:27.359
the light intensity
at the receiving end.

27:27.742 --> 27:30.590
Send the signal through
a telephone receiver,

27:30.664 --> 27:33.921
but instead of attaching
the magnet to a diaphragm...

27:35.763 --> 27:40.013
- Attach it to a fine-toothed comb.
- Oh...

27:40.207 --> 27:43.658
As the magnet moves, the amount
of light getting through changes.

27:43.989 --> 27:45.599
What's all this, then?

27:45.724 --> 27:47.824
It's something Mr. Tesla and I...

27:47.855 --> 27:50.111
It is tele-vision.

27:50.541 --> 27:51.905
What?

27:51.916 --> 27:56.406
It's a means by which to convert
moving images into electrical signal.

27:56.458 --> 27:58.378
Will it help catch an invisible man?

28:03.980 --> 28:06.627
Miss Rossini? Is everything all right?

28:06.991 --> 28:09.730
- The professor came to see me last night.
- He did?

28:09.855 --> 28:12.800
- You saw him?
- No, not exactly.

28:13.397 --> 28:15.128
He made me turn out the lights,

28:15.144 --> 28:17.122
and then he put a blindfold on me.

28:17.247 --> 28:20.301
I thought perhaps he'd suffered
some terrible deformity.

28:20.358 --> 28:23.170
- What did he want?
- He'd come for his box.

28:23.233 --> 28:24.796
And when I told him you had it,

28:24.849 --> 28:26.916
he became very angry.

28:28.065 --> 28:30.068
What's happened to him, Detective?

28:30.326 --> 28:31.973
What's going on?

28:32.098 --> 28:34.832
He has made himself invisible.
That is what happened.

28:34.957 --> 28:37.119
- Invisible?
- It appears he is attempting

28:37.140 --> 28:40.356
to exact revenge on all those
he feels have wronged him.

28:40.481 --> 28:43.136
But... but I wronged him.

28:43.178 --> 28:45.984
I let you have the box. I...

28:47.348 --> 28:49.031
He's here.

28:49.110 --> 28:50.604
He's what?

28:50.706 --> 28:53.349
I can smell his pipe tobacco.

28:54.041 --> 28:57.110
Now that she mentions it.

28:57.382 --> 28:59.187
Yes, I smell it as well.

28:59.223 --> 29:03.147
He must have followed me
here. Ah!! He touched me!!

29:03.903 --> 29:05.687
Shut all the doors!

29:07.428 --> 29:08.855
Good thinking. We'll trap him.

29:08.876 --> 29:10.995
Alright. No one move.

29:12.002 --> 29:13.969
He's here inside the Station House.

29:13.996 --> 29:15.948
We'll clear the offices one at a time,

29:15.984 --> 29:17.768
but first, I want silence.

29:18.749 --> 29:21.146
Listen.

29:21.271 --> 29:24.881
Look for any sign of
movement. Don't let him escape.

29:27.478 --> 29:30.106
- Bloody hell. Shut the door!
- Shut the door!

29:32.568 --> 29:34.996
Well, if he was here, he's escaped now.

29:35.075 --> 29:38.065
Sirs, we've got a problem.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.056
Miss Rossini?

29:42.477 --> 29:44.258
Is he still out there?

29:44.359 --> 29:46.547
If he was here, he's since fled.

29:46.574 --> 29:48.559
Hold it. Bosworth was
here? In the Station House?

29:48.583 --> 29:50.340
Oi! You keep your nose out of this.

29:50.351 --> 29:53.383
Hey, I gave your confession
in exchange for protection.

29:53.614 --> 29:55.885
Henry, please escort Miss Rossini home.

29:55.906 --> 29:59.316
- And ensure that her room is unoccupied.
- Sir.

29:59.772 --> 30:01.849
I want protection!

30:01.881 --> 30:04.792
You'll need protection from me
if you don't keep your mouth shut.

30:07.872 --> 30:10.505
He's right, sir. We do
owe him our best efforts.

30:10.510 --> 30:12.640
We'll have a constable
in the cells at all times.

30:12.698 --> 30:13.955
All the doors stay locked.

30:13.956 --> 30:16.196
Not even an invisible
man can get through bars.

30:16.254 --> 30:18.593
Sir. There is a set of keys missing.

30:18.656 --> 30:20.151
What if he took them?

30:20.193 --> 30:22.511
We would have seen the keys
floating through the air.

30:22.543 --> 30:25.003
Not if we weren't looking at that time.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.027
Well, I say we wait for him. He's
been in here once and got away.

30:29.048 --> 30:32.589
- More likely he's getting cocky.
- How will we know if he's here?

30:32.778 --> 30:36.150
Even an invisible man has to open doors.

30:36.275 --> 30:38.891
We need to be alert.
Keep our eyes wide open.

30:38.911 --> 30:42.084
Eyes do not stay open.
They blink. They turn away.

30:42.209 --> 30:46.130
It may only be for a moment,
but a moment is all he needs.

30:46.169 --> 30:47.599
So what do you suggest?

30:47.724 --> 30:51.926
We need an unblinking eye that
remembers everything that it sees.

30:52.386 --> 30:54.462
Tele-vision.

30:57.594 --> 31:01.555
With tele-vision, we
can review events such as

31:01.581 --> 31:05.319
doors opening and closing,
objects moving by themselves...

31:05.340 --> 31:07.765
Which will tell us when
he's in the Station.

31:07.824 --> 31:11.357
- They will be the eyes that never close.
- They?

31:11.620 --> 31:14.709
We're building four
sensors and one monitor.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.728
So quickly?

31:17.004 --> 31:19.785
Well, the Nipkow disks
have already been drilled.

31:19.811 --> 31:22.403
Mr. Tesla is obtaining
selenium from the university.

31:22.413 --> 31:25.539
The rest is just a reworking
of existing devices.

31:25.592 --> 31:29.862
All to catch an invisible
man that can't possibly exist.

31:30.429 --> 31:31.799
Oh?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.602
Last night you embraced the idea.

31:34.923 --> 31:39.282
Well, I accept that
atoms could be re-aligned

31:39.303 --> 31:41.585
to allow light through an object,

31:41.710 --> 31:44.764
but our bodies are living systems

31:44.791 --> 31:46.580
in a constant state of renewal.

31:46.853 --> 31:49.182
Even if one doesn't eat, every breath

31:49.209 --> 31:52.067
brings in a flood of
non-realigned atoms.

31:52.192 --> 31:55.167
Perhaps, but air is invisible.

31:55.292 --> 31:59.571
Yes, but those atoms
will join with other atoms

31:59.592 --> 32:02.463
to form molecules which
are, in fact, visible.

32:03.899 --> 32:07.768
What does Alfred Epstein
have to say about that?

32:29.421 --> 32:32.791
- What's all this, then?
- Ah, sir, have a look.

32:40.975 --> 32:44.385
Bloody hell. He made it
invisible. You made it invisible.

32:44.444 --> 32:46.300
It's a magician's trick.

32:46.425 --> 32:49.592
The same that Dr. Roberts
used in his time machine.

32:49.664 --> 32:51.560
Oh, right. I remember.

32:51.685 --> 32:54.058
And what about invisible Bosworth?

32:54.268 --> 32:57.438
Well, his suit would have to
be specifically constructed, but

32:57.495 --> 32:59.206
you can see how it could work.

32:59.772 --> 33:02.553
But what are the bandages
clinging to if not his head?

33:02.962 --> 33:05.983
- Follow me.
- He's very good.

33:09.288 --> 33:12.881
Heavily starched and
wrapped around a balloon.

33:16.778 --> 33:18.216
Also a trick.

33:18.242 --> 33:19.958
I confess I am disappointed

33:19.995 --> 33:22.617
that you would seek a
conventional explanation.

33:22.742 --> 33:25.766
- It's what I do.
- Let me get this straight.

33:25.813 --> 33:28.010
He's now NOT invisible.

33:28.026 --> 33:31.273
- We don't know that for certain.
- I suspect not.

33:31.398 --> 33:32.941
And he wasn't in the Station.

33:32.968 --> 33:35.202
It was just our
imaginations running amok.

33:35.417 --> 33:39.126
- There's more.
- Of course there is. There always is.

33:41.530 --> 33:43.713
Are we transmitting?

33:43.995 --> 33:47.235
We are now receiving the
signal from the jail cells.

33:47.772 --> 33:50.455
Adjust the primary comb...

33:51.458 --> 33:54.212
And now the speed of the motor.

33:56.802 --> 33:58.445
There.

33:59.897 --> 34:02.821
- This is happening right now?
- It is, sir.

34:03.103 --> 34:05.970
- How wonderful! You got it to work!
- We certainly did.

34:05.996 --> 34:09.871
And we can also select other sensors.

34:10.277 --> 34:12.833
Is that us?

34:16.873 --> 34:19.848
Congratulations, gentlemen,
on your new invention.

34:19.873 --> 34:21.527
Whatever good it's for.

34:21.652 --> 34:23.614
Right then, I'll bid you all goodnight.

34:23.635 --> 34:25.822
You're leaving? We should celebrate!

34:25.880 --> 34:28.199
I have an opera to attend.

34:37.274 --> 34:39.393
You know, I'm sure you could find a way

34:39.409 --> 34:43.260
to transmit this to our house
and you could watch it all night.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.302
It would indeed be possible.

34:45.427 --> 34:49.088
Everyone in the world could
have tele-vision in their homes.

34:49.125 --> 34:51.411
Oh, I think it's best not.

34:51.431 --> 34:55.010
The weak-minded would waste
half of their lives observing it.

34:56.452 --> 34:58.814
It is fascinating to
think that I'm watching

34:58.877 --> 35:01.108
what's happening right now.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.162
William! Look!

35:06.012 --> 35:07.879
Where's Henry?

35:30.101 --> 35:33.517
I was just checking the doors
when I was grabbed from behind.

35:33.642 --> 35:35.909
A rag was pushed into my face,

35:35.915 --> 35:38.207
and the next I knew, Dr.
Ogden was shaking me awake.

35:38.233 --> 35:39.886
He'd been chloroformed.

35:40.011 --> 35:41.675
He must have used the stolen key

35:41.680 --> 35:44.088
to access the back
door to the jail room.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.733
There.

35:49.695 --> 35:51.038
He IS invisible.

35:51.064 --> 35:53.582
I was wrong and it cost
our prisoner his life.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.109
We were both wrong, William.

35:55.161 --> 35:58.030
On the contrary. I
can say with certainty

35:58.062 --> 36:01.031
that your original
assumption was correct.

36:01.571 --> 36:03.560
He is not invisible at all.

36:03.749 --> 36:07.442
- But the tele-vision shows...
- The tele-vision is our proof!

36:07.673 --> 36:10.317
Have you ever seen Bosworth

36:10.674 --> 36:12.568
in this image?

36:12.945 --> 36:14.829
- No.
- Exactly.

36:14.907 --> 36:16.990
Professor Bosworth's realignment

36:17.021 --> 36:20.478
is only effective for light
in the very narrow part

36:20.499 --> 36:24.250
of the electromagnetic
spectrum that humans can see.

36:24.581 --> 36:27.052
If Mr. Einsteen's theory is correct...

36:27.094 --> 36:30.846
Wavelengths outside the visual
range would also dislodge electrons.

36:30.882 --> 36:33.490
- And if Bosworth were really here...
- We would be able

36:33.495 --> 36:36.302
- to see him on the tele-vision.
- So the fact that we can't

36:36.323 --> 36:38.600
means that he's not invisible.

36:44.097 --> 36:46.175
- What can I offer you?
- What have you got?

36:46.238 --> 36:48.195
- Whiskey.
- It better be scotch.

36:50.582 --> 36:52.486
I don't drink anything else.

37:04.525 --> 37:06.204
Got any cigars?

37:06.472 --> 37:08.895
I've never seen a woman smoke a cigar.

37:09.777 --> 37:11.503
Jack hated it.

37:11.744 --> 37:13.349
So does Margaret.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.020
She won't even let me
kiss her afterwards.

37:30.565 --> 37:32.848
- Oh, Thomas.
- Oh, Verna.

37:39.903 --> 37:42.694
It feels funny saying
your name like that.

37:42.924 --> 37:44.692
It felt nice to hear it.

37:46.785 --> 37:49.859
I don't think I'm ready to
give up on Margaret just yet.

37:50.315 --> 37:52.046
Even if she won't have you back?

37:52.880 --> 37:54.673
I'm sorry.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.193
Narrow gauge filament

38:12.318 --> 38:14.412
can be very difficult to see.

38:14.580 --> 38:17.224
As long as the line is kept taut.

38:17.349 --> 38:18.798
But when was it set up?

38:18.845 --> 38:21.678
Constable Higgins was in
the cells the whole time.

38:23.529 --> 38:25.155
Unless...

38:26.697 --> 38:29.661
What if this is the moment
when Henry was attacked?

38:31.166 --> 38:33.291
Could this be Professor Bosworth?

38:33.416 --> 38:36.013
He never shows his face to the sensor.

38:36.092 --> 38:37.896
No, he doesn't.

38:38.866 --> 38:40.136
And look.

38:40.382 --> 38:42.890
With one hand he's checking the locks,

38:42.921 --> 38:46.384
and with the other hand he's
stringing along the filament.

38:48.115 --> 38:49.746
We've been fooled.

38:55.196 --> 38:57.200
Well, how did he stab him, then?

38:57.253 --> 38:59.976
He shot a bolt. Likely
with a small crossbow.

39:00.018 --> 39:02.452
- How did he get the bolt back?
- Filament.

39:02.489 --> 39:03.879
He was harpooned, then?

39:04.062 --> 39:06.732
Right. So Bosworth never was invisible.

39:06.937 --> 39:08.537
Neither was the screwdriver.

39:08.584 --> 39:12.666
The film was made to lure the
investors into providing more funds.

39:12.667 --> 39:15.619
But wait a minute. He
had the jail cell keys.

39:15.646 --> 39:17.834
I mean, if he was visible,
we would've seen him.

39:17.850 --> 39:19.612
Somebody must have
been working with him.

39:20.142 --> 39:22.691
- It wasn't one of our own, was it?
- I don't think so.

39:22.744 --> 39:25.335
There was one other
person in the Station House

39:25.356 --> 39:26.676
at the time the key went missing.

39:27.292 --> 39:31.326
Miss Rossini led us to believe
Bosworth was in the Station House.

39:31.363 --> 39:33.399
Ah!! He touched me!!

39:33.425 --> 39:35.801
No one was watching
her. Shut all the doors!

39:35.837 --> 39:38.538
We were all looking
for an invisible man.

39:38.580 --> 39:41.953
- That's bloody brilliant.
- Have the constables check the train stations.

39:41.969 --> 39:44.004
- They may be trying to escape.
- Where are you off to?

39:44.020 --> 39:45.735
To find her. Or them.

39:45.992 --> 39:48.311
George and I will begin at her house.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.291
- Anything upstairs?
- No, sir.

39:57.343 --> 39:58.812
Have a look at this.

40:00.375 --> 40:03.329
The Great Rossini?! Did
you ever see him, sir?

40:03.454 --> 40:05.354
I'm not much for carnival shows.

40:05.390 --> 40:09.019
Oh, sir, he was incredible. He
would make his daughter disappear.

40:09.025 --> 40:10.909
He would put her in one of these chests,

40:10.956 --> 40:12.735
and the next thing
you know, she was gone.

40:13.065 --> 40:15.085
His daughter, George.

40:15.210 --> 40:18.050
- Do you think...
- Fiona Rossini

40:18.097 --> 40:20.117
is the Great Rossini's daughter.

40:20.589 --> 40:22.813
You're probably right, sir.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.168
Ah. George.

40:30.677 --> 40:32.072
Sir.

40:37.165 --> 40:38.755
Salt.

41:00.191 --> 41:01.911
Good lord.

41:02.731 --> 41:05.079
- Sir, isn't that...
- Professor Bosworth.

41:05.258 --> 41:06.826
But if he's dead...

41:07.555 --> 41:11.195
Then Fiona Rossini is the invisible man.

41:15.392 --> 41:18.189
When my father died,
I inherited his act,

41:18.672 --> 41:20.533
but I had no heart for it.

41:22.673 --> 41:25.108
I bought the house and took boarders.

41:25.643 --> 41:27.762
Including Professor Bosworth.

41:28.308 --> 41:29.876
We fell in love.

41:30.107 --> 41:31.890
He was so brilliant.

41:32.015 --> 41:34.367
So driven to prove
his device could work.

41:34.797 --> 41:36.219
But it didn't.

41:36.444 --> 41:38.154
He felt he was close.

41:38.217 --> 41:41.931
He was corresponding with Mr. Tesla.
He just needed a little more time.

41:42.282 --> 41:43.746
A little more money.

41:44.586 --> 41:47.739
- But the investors balked.
- He was crushed.

41:47.807 --> 41:49.417
So I said to him:

41:49.994 --> 41:54.076
"If you believe, make them believe."

41:54.778 --> 41:57.579
So you made the
screwdriver appear invisible

41:57.841 --> 41:59.379
and they fell for it.

42:00.323 --> 42:02.373
And so they decided to kill him.

42:03.092 --> 42:05.656
And you set out for revenge.

42:06.727 --> 42:09.228
And what better way
than to make them believe

42:09.244 --> 42:11.683
the man they tried to
kill was now invisible

42:11.700 --> 42:13.478
and coming after them?

42:13.971 --> 42:16.246
And the police would
forever be searching

42:16.247 --> 42:19.411
for an invisible man
that does not exist.

42:19.975 --> 42:22.142
How did you figure it out?

42:22.590 --> 42:24.819
A wondrous invention.

42:25.847 --> 42:27.489
Tele-vision.

42:32.399 --> 42:35.856
Once again, Detective, we
used physics to solve a murder.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.059
And had some fun while you were at it.

42:38.290 --> 42:41.459
Are you going to patent
this tele-vision of yours?

42:41.480 --> 42:43.205
What is to patent?

42:43.803 --> 42:48.059
We didn't do anything that wouldn't
be obvious to any scientist.

42:48.184 --> 42:51.665
Besides, it would be of
limited interest to the public.

42:52.388 --> 42:54.854
Thank you, Detective Murdoch.

42:55.353 --> 42:58.198
Invisibility, on the other hand...

43:03.790 --> 43:06.163
I had a visit from George, by the way.

43:06.288 --> 43:11.616
Yes. I've given him permission
to 'improve' our manuscript.

43:11.686 --> 43:14.979
Well, he suggested that we
arrange the book case by case.

43:15.011 --> 43:17.140
I thought perhaps we would call it

43:17.177 --> 43:19.714
The Cases of Detective
Murdoch and Doctor Ogden.

43:19.816 --> 43:22.557
Or The Murdoch Casefiles.

43:22.682 --> 43:25.988
Am I not to be in the title at all?

43:26.255 --> 43:27.830
Was it not you that told me

43:27.845 --> 43:30.150
that a writer needs
to have a thick skin?

43:30.175 --> 43:32.236
Yes, William, but when I said that,

43:32.273 --> 43:35.018
I didn't mean for it
to be applied to me!
