00:01.523 --> 00:03.046
[Supergirl]
Previously onSupergirl...

00:03.090 --> 00:04.656
Supergirl saved me.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.484
[Tanya] Coville's teachings
are so misguided.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.182
[cultist]
In the name of Coville,

00:08.225 --> 00:11.011
please bring us back
the journal.

00:11.054 --> 00:12.751
That was her. I saw her face.

00:12.795 --> 00:16.799
I will do everything
within my power
to keep you safe.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.931
[Supergirl]
Without your Kryptonite,
we wouldn't have stopped her.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.455
I'm gonna go work on a cure.

00:20.498 --> 00:23.110
I broke into your lab.
For Supergirl,
she asked me to.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.372
She crossed a line.

00:24.415 --> 00:25.895
I can never trust her again.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.509
[Lena] It's a biolistic
delivery system.

00:31.553 --> 00:34.860
It's usually used for
overwriting genes in crops,
but...

00:34.904 --> 00:37.515
Reign's cells are closer
to plant cells
than you'd think.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.257
Part of how Kryptonians
process sunlight.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.780
How does it work?

00:41.824 --> 00:44.522
You take particles
of heavy metal,
coat them in DNA,

00:44.566 --> 00:45.784
deliver the payload,

00:45.828 --> 00:48.091
and then overwrite Reign's DNA
with Sam's.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.919
[machine beeping, whirring]

00:51.921 --> 00:53.879
Plasmid inserted.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.446
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Payload rejected.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.667
I thought this would work.

00:58.710 --> 01:00.930
I just need the right vectors
with the right metal.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.106
I just need more time.

01:03.150 --> 01:04.934
[Reign] Yes.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.544
Give Lena more time.

01:06.588 --> 01:08.503
She doesn't have much left.

01:08.546 --> 01:11.027
Because when I'm free,

01:11.071 --> 01:13.073
I'm gonna rip out her spine.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.944
And when that's done,

01:14.987 --> 01:18.774
I'm gonna crack this planet
in half, and you'll hear
every scream--

01:18.817 --> 01:20.906
-Okay, we don't need
to hear that.
-[Reign screaming]

01:20.950 --> 01:22.082
What was that?

01:22.125 --> 01:23.909
It's a refractive
scatter-field.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.302
She can't see us now.

01:25.346 --> 01:27.087
[stammers]
Even with the X-Ray vision?

01:29.698 --> 01:30.916
[groans]

01:31.178 --> 01:32.570
Yeah.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.572
Even with X-Ray vision.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.487
The wavelength interference
of the force field

01:36.531 --> 01:37.880
hurts any Kryptonian
that looks at it,

01:37.923 --> 01:40.187
and the shock seems
to keep her in check.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.276
Lena, I thought we talked
about this.

01:42.319 --> 01:45.366
You said if you developed
any weapons
that could hurt Kryptonians,

01:45.409 --> 01:46.758
you would put them
on my radar.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.021
-This isn't a weapon.
-It might as well be.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.762
I told you about Kryptonite.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.200
And I will tell you
if I make it again,

01:53.243 --> 01:54.505
'cause I agreed to that.

01:54.549 --> 01:57.247
But with regards
to other things
I work on,

01:57.291 --> 01:58.814
this may come
as a shock to you,

01:58.857 --> 02:01.033
but I don't think about you
while I'm doing it.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.125
Kara.

02:06.343 --> 02:07.605
Something happened with Reign?

02:07.649 --> 02:10.652
No, actually, it's Lena.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.395
Why did you tell her
that Supergirl has Guardian

02:14.438 --> 02:16.136
to go into her lab
to find Kryptonite?

02:17.441 --> 02:18.790
Now she has a problem with me.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.618
She does not have
a problem with you.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.577
She couldn't wait
to see you this morning.
She was talking about it.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.188
She can't wait to see Kara,
not Supergirl.

02:25.232 --> 02:28.278
She has a problem
with Supergirl.

02:28.322 --> 02:31.455
[sighs] Supergirl can't
tell her that
she can actually trust me

02:31.499 --> 02:33.196
because I'm her best friend,
Kara,

02:33.240 --> 02:35.981
but Kara can't tell her
why Supergirl took it
so personally

02:36.025 --> 02:37.983
that she was using Kryptonite
behind her back

02:38.027 --> 02:41.465
because Lena doesn't
actually know that
I'm Supergirl.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.685
You know what you said
is really confusing, right?

02:44.338 --> 02:45.817
You should've had my back.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.559
Look, I'm sorry I told her,

02:48.603 --> 02:50.300
but I felt like
it was important to be honest.

02:50.344 --> 02:53.085
-At my expense?
-I really like her.

02:53.129 --> 02:56.480
And for this to move forward,
I have to be honest
about my life,

02:56.524 --> 02:58.308
about everything,
about Guardian.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.962
And because I was,
she opened up to me.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.138
I'm really happy for you,
James. I really am.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.750
But I can't be honest
with Lena, and you know it.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.099
You were straight with me.

03:07.143 --> 03:10.538
My secret identity is there
to protect people,

03:10.581 --> 03:12.017
and if Lena knew
I was Supergirl,

03:12.061 --> 03:14.368
people might use it
against her.

03:14.411 --> 03:18.459
For the past two years,
I've had to be dishonest
with her

03:18.502 --> 03:21.026
while she's been
opening up to me.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.028
Lillian Luthor said it,
and she was right.

03:23.072 --> 03:26.031
If Lena ever found out
that I was Supergirl,

03:26.075 --> 03:27.729
she would be devastated,

03:27.772 --> 03:29.339
and she would lump me in
with every other person
in her life

03:29.383 --> 03:30.558
that's betrayed her.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.342
[Eve] Oh, can I help you?
This is a meeting.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.604
You can't...

03:33.648 --> 03:35.476
-Are you James Olsen?
-[mouthing] Sorry.

03:35.519 --> 03:36.564
[James] It's okay, Eve.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.130
Yeah, can I help you?

03:38.174 --> 03:39.219
Are you okay?

03:40.089 --> 03:42.222
You know Supergirl?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.746
I need you to get this to her.

03:45.399 --> 03:46.487
What is this?

03:46.530 --> 03:48.053
It's Thomas Coville's journal.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.272
How did you get this?

03:49.316 --> 03:51.143
I stole it from his cult.

03:51.187 --> 03:54.843
Can you get it to her or not?
I thought you two were close.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.585
I think his followers
are using it to make a bomb.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.285
[theme music playing]

04:05.593 --> 04:09.466
I was a teacher.
Linguistics and semiotics.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.555
You helped Coville
learn Kryptonian.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.253
He found me.

04:13.296 --> 04:16.256
I'd been saved by her.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.475
I...

04:18.519 --> 04:21.217
I just wanted the miracle
to mean something.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.784
But when Reign came,

04:22.827 --> 04:25.743
the followers started
making me translate
his journal.

04:25.787 --> 04:28.746
It had everything
he'd ever learned
about Krypton,

04:28.790 --> 04:31.096
and I was the only one left
who knew how to read it.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.056
But what I read,

04:34.709 --> 04:36.319
it was like a recipe.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.973
Explosives.

04:39.670 --> 04:40.976
Where's Coville now?

04:41.019 --> 04:42.934
He just vanished.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.415
The others were saying
that he died serving Reign,

04:45.459 --> 04:47.330
that he's a martyr.

04:47.374 --> 04:48.766
They'd become fanatics.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.292
And where are his
disciples now?

04:57.993 --> 05:00.648
This is where I ran away from.

05:04.173 --> 05:08.003
Look, I know I should
have left earlier,

05:08.046 --> 05:12.703
but at first, it was so nice
to believe in something,

05:12.747 --> 05:14.052
to connect to people.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.360
But then Reign came,

05:17.404 --> 05:22.191
and Coville got word
to us that we were worshiping
the wrong god,

05:23.105 --> 05:25.150
that Reign was
our deliverance.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.938
I-I should go.
They'll be looking for me.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.069
-They need this book.
-[James] No, no, hey, hey.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.332
[Kara] Wait.
Why don't you stay here?

05:33.507 --> 05:34.856
I'll call security here.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.076
Where are you going?

05:38.686 --> 05:40.078
To get this to Supergirl.

05:40.122 --> 05:42.342
She'll find the cult,
and she'll stop them.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.433
I'm also friends with her.

05:49.044 --> 05:50.393
[Alex] If you thought I was
a badass before,

05:50.437 --> 05:53.091
you just wait until you see
what I just bought.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.225
It's parked right outside.
You wanna go see it?

05:57.879 --> 06:00.490
Look, it's a 1962 Item.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.840
I have always wanted
this bike.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.626
What do you say? You wanna
take a ride around the block?

06:05.669 --> 06:08.411
I got you your own helmet.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.370
No, thanks.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.720
Oh, um...

06:12.763 --> 06:15.157
Yeah, that's okay. Uh...

06:15.200 --> 06:18.552
Um, well, what's something
that you've always
wanted to do?

06:18.595 --> 06:19.988
I mean, didn't you
tell me once

06:20.031 --> 06:22.033
that you wanted to dye
the ends of your hair blue?

06:22.077 --> 06:23.208
No.

06:24.645 --> 06:25.994
Um...

06:26.908 --> 06:30.302
Well, what if we got you
a pet?

06:30.346 --> 06:31.739
Why don't we get you a cat?

06:32.261 --> 06:34.655
My mom's allergic.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.874
Uh... Would you wanna
play Scrabble?

06:36.918 --> 06:39.050
Or we could just talk.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.923
No offense, but I just wanna
be left alone right now.

06:43.925 --> 06:47.145
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.241
I know you can't be
100% honest with Lena,

06:56.285 --> 06:58.766
but maybe you could,
I don't know,

06:58.809 --> 07:00.768
go to her as Supergirl

07:00.811 --> 07:03.074
and explain why you had James
do what he did,

07:03.118 --> 07:04.380
and see if she understands.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.077
Hmm.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.299
[door creaking]

07:16.523 --> 07:18.438
[suspenseful music playing]

07:34.671 --> 07:36.107
This was a person.

07:37.544 --> 07:40.590
You see shadows like this
after nuclear strikes,

07:40.634 --> 07:42.853
but this whole building's
intact.

07:44.551 --> 07:46.161
What kind of bomb
were they making?

07:46.640 --> 07:47.945
Excuse me?

07:49.599 --> 07:52.428
I know you, right?
You're, uh, Olivia.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.908
We met at Coville's meeting.

07:53.951 --> 07:55.518
I need to know
if Tanya is here.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.390
We got separated, and I need
to know that she's okay.

07:58.434 --> 08:00.610
She's fine. Just calm down.
Everything's good.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.264
-It's not safe here!
-Were you followed?

08:02.307 --> 08:03.874
-[guard] Let her go!
-[Eve screaming]

08:03.918 --> 08:05.528
[Eve] James, help!
They're taking Tanya!

08:05.572 --> 08:07.574
[James] Hey!

08:07.617 --> 08:09.706
-[gun cocking]
-You could say that.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.621
-[people panicking]
-Hey, hey, hey. Come on.

08:11.665 --> 08:12.753
-[Tanya] James, help!
-Tanya.

08:12.796 --> 08:13.841
[Tanya] Let me go!

08:13.884 --> 08:15.582
Take it easy.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.061
Just take it easy, okay?

08:17.105 --> 08:18.889
-[gunshot]
-[Tanya] Let me go!

08:22.240 --> 08:23.459
Call 911.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.026
-You okay?
-Yeah.

08:27.115 --> 08:28.246
[beeps]

08:32.337 --> 08:33.513
Coltrane.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.344
[dramatic music playing]

08:39.388 --> 08:41.346
[Tanya grunting]

08:41.390 --> 08:44.524
[Tanya shouting]
Help! Help! James!

08:45.046 --> 08:46.961
[tires screeching]

[motorcycle revving]

09:12.856 --> 09:14.554
[tires screeching]

09:18.079 --> 09:19.602
[man] Let's go. Move!

09:27.175 --> 09:29.003
-[wire whizzing]
-[man grunting]

09:29.569 --> 09:31.005
[screaming]

09:33.094 --> 09:34.574
[Guardian] Let her go.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.097
[grunting]

09:37.751 --> 09:39.317
[Olivia] No.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.189
She needs to finish
what she started.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.151
[grunting]

09:51.068 --> 09:52.243
[cop 1] Freeze!

09:52.287 --> 09:53.593
[cop 2] Don't move.
Don't move.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.118
Show me your hands.

10:00.295 --> 10:02.123
-I am not armed.
-I said freeze!

10:02.906 --> 10:04.429
No, no. Don't, please.

10:04.952 --> 10:06.127
He's protecting me.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.432
Down on your knees!

10:07.476 --> 10:09.086
[Tanya] No, it's not him,
it's them.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.138
[explosion]

10:19.967 --> 10:21.446
[Tanya] Wait, hold up.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.100
You're Guardian?

10:23.144 --> 10:25.320
Yep, just try not to put that
on social media,

10:25.363 --> 10:26.930
I'm trying to keep it
on the low.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.758
Okay. Sorry. I just...

10:28.802 --> 10:30.368
That is so awesome.

10:30.978 --> 10:32.327
I had no idea.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.503
I thought you were
just friends with Supergirl,

10:34.546 --> 10:37.071
but you're Super...
Well, not "man",

10:37.114 --> 10:38.420
uh, because
that's already taken.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.552
-But you're super.
-They're super.

10:40.596 --> 10:41.945
I'm just Guardian.

10:41.989 --> 10:44.252
Oh, no, come on.
Don't downplay it.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.558
You're Guardian.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.126
You're a superhero.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.998
[James sighs]

10:51.825 --> 10:53.827
And they still would've
shot you.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.524
You forget,
they did shoot me.

10:55.567 --> 10:57.265
-In the face,
with armor-piercing bullets.
-[metal clanging]

10:57.308 --> 11:01.138
No, not the acolytes,
the police.

11:01.182 --> 11:05.752
I've seen it happen
to my father, my brothers.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.144
I just...

11:08.929 --> 11:11.105
never thought
it would happen to Guardian.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.195
I should get changed.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.066
Come on.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.554
Some light reading?

11:26.555 --> 11:27.861
Yeah.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.690
I'm just trying to figure out
how to reach Ruby.

11:30.733 --> 11:34.258
I mean, I lost my dad
as a teenager,
so I figured,

11:34.302 --> 11:36.521
"Hey, I should be
a natural at helping her

11:36.565 --> 11:39.350
get through this whole ordeal
with her mom."

11:39.394 --> 11:41.788
But nothing I have tried
is working.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.181
-[clicks tongue]
-So I bought every book
that I could find

11:44.225 --> 11:45.966
on helping kids deal
with trauma.

11:46.009 --> 11:48.446
I'd imagine none
of those books have chapters
on what to do

11:48.490 --> 11:50.840
when your mother's
a Worldkiller who tried
to murder you.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.842
Mmm. Tsk.
Yeah, they left that one out.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.061
Hmm.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.367
She's been in her pajamas
for over a week,

11:56.411 --> 11:58.413
and she hasn't even left
the apartment.

11:58.456 --> 12:01.068
[scoffs] I know
all about that.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.898
[sighs] All about that.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.944
My father is growing
more and more withdrawn,

12:07.988 --> 12:09.467
and intransigent.

12:09.511 --> 12:12.209
I mean, he still has
his good days, you know.

12:12.253 --> 12:14.603
Unfortunately, those days
are few and far between.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.952
[Alex] Mmm.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.519
[Alex sighs]

12:18.172 --> 12:20.565
I'm sorry, J'onn.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.786
I just wish there was some way
I could slow down the illness.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.570
I mean, now that he's wearing
that psychic inhibitor,

12:25.614 --> 12:28.835
his brain is almost identical
to that of a human.

12:28.878 --> 12:33.404
I've been doing some research
on the plasticity
of the brain.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.145
You know,
studies apparently show

12:35.189 --> 12:37.582
that playing three-dimensional
video games

12:37.626 --> 12:41.238
actually could reverse
the decline.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.632
Sounds like you should
take him to the arcade.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.029
Do you think you could
help us figure out
what kind of bomb did this?

12:49.072 --> 12:51.901
Yeah, well, Lena's
spectra analysis equipment

12:51.945 --> 12:53.685
is sort of running
on overdrive,

12:53.729 --> 12:55.600
so we're gonna have to go back
to the DEO.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.602
-Sure.
-[Mon-El] Yeah,
we'll go with you.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.431
And we can go over
Coville's journal
while we work.

13:00.475 --> 13:01.650
Good idea.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.958
Hey, hey. Um...

13:05.001 --> 13:06.829
You guys go ahead.
I'll catch up.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.788
I'm gonna try this out.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.746
Bangarang.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.797
I'm no closer to finding
a cure for Sam

13:17.840 --> 13:19.320
than I was this morning, so...

13:21.670 --> 13:25.282
I don't like this tension
between us, Lena.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.067
And I know it's my fault.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.460
I know James told you
what I asked him to do,

13:29.504 --> 13:32.115
and, look, I feel terrible
about it.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.379
I made a huge mistake,
and I'm sorry.

13:35.423 --> 13:38.687
It's easy to admit
your mistake
when you've been exposed.

13:39.253 --> 13:40.645
That's fair.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.868
I just don't want one mistake
to ruin our friendship,
that's all.

13:45.912 --> 13:46.869
It won't.

13:47.435 --> 13:48.523
Good.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.612
We don't have a friendship,
Supergirl.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.222
All this time
we've been working together,

13:52.266 --> 13:53.528
it's been about work.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.660
We have a mission to complete.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.880
And I am not about to let
any tension between you and I

13:57.924 --> 13:59.795
get in the way of that.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.189
-Are you?
-Of course not.

14:05.366 --> 14:09.065
I-I just hope, um,
when we solve this,

14:09.109 --> 14:11.459
we can work
to rebuild our trust.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.809
Why is it so important to you
that we're friends?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.419
I have friends, Supergirl.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.987
Friends that don't scheme
behind my back or lie.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.903
Given my family history,
they know how painful
that would be.

14:20.947 --> 14:23.166
They also know I would never
enter into a friendship

14:23.210 --> 14:25.299
with anyone who's already
breached that trust.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.866
Understood.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.787
[Myr'nn] Where's the arcade?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.789
It's right there, Father.

14:37.833 --> 14:39.530
Do you think I'm a fool?

14:39.574 --> 14:44.405
The arcade is a high form
of architecture
of ancient Rome.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.190
Archways resting on columns.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.888
Where are the shops?

14:48.931 --> 14:50.063
The marketplace?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.152
This is a different kind
of arcade, Dad.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.328
[exhales] Okay.
Let's go, team, huh?

14:55.590 --> 14:57.200
Oh. Um...

14:57.244 --> 14:59.115
[exhales] Well,
I'll catch you inside. Yeah.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.377
[Hank Henshaw] Sure.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.033
What happened?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.817
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.037
They came for me.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.778
You'll never believe
who the heavy was.

15:11.171 --> 15:12.650
Olivia.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.304
Olivia?

15:14.348 --> 15:17.655
But she was the first one
to turn on Coville
at the stadium.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.093
Yeah, you're right.
She was lost after that.

15:20.136 --> 15:24.227
More than the rest,
but she kept visiting him
in prison.

15:24.271 --> 15:25.837
You should've called me.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.143
[Tanya laughs] Oh!

15:27.187 --> 15:28.840
Guardian had it handled.

15:28.884 --> 15:29.929
[exclaims]

15:31.495 --> 15:33.715
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
start a church or anything.

15:34.455 --> 15:35.935
[James clears throat]

15:35.978 --> 15:37.458
About that, um...

15:37.501 --> 15:39.503
So, any luck finding the cult?

15:39.547 --> 15:42.245
We went back
to where you escaped from.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.030
They weren't there,

15:44.073 --> 15:47.294
but we did find evidence that
they were trying
to build the bomb

15:47.337 --> 15:49.339
you told James
and Kara Danvers about.

15:50.819 --> 15:51.863
But they failed.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.912
Um, we think someone
might have died there.

15:58.566 --> 15:59.654
[gasps]

16:06.095 --> 16:07.836
This was Liza's.

16:08.837 --> 16:09.969
She was my friend.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.493
[cell phone chimes]

16:18.151 --> 16:19.369
What is it?

16:20.980 --> 16:21.981
James.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.072
"Give us Tanya
and the journal,

16:26.115 --> 16:28.596
or the world
will see your true face."

16:32.948 --> 16:35.472
They're gonna tell
National City I'm Guardian.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.039
[dramatic music playing]

16:39.302 --> 16:41.348
"You must deliver Tanya
and the journal

16:41.391 --> 16:43.959
to the corner
of Pacific and First
at 5:00 p.m.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.830
If you fail to show up,

16:45.874 --> 16:49.225
we will go live
with this video and reveal
James Olsen as Guardian

16:49.269 --> 16:50.574
to all of National City."

16:50.618 --> 16:52.533
I'm so sorry I put you
at risk.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.317
No, no,
it's not your fault.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
If they expose your identity,

16:56.102 --> 16:57.190
then you're a vigilante.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.626
They could arrest you,

16:58.669 --> 17:00.497
and then all of those people
that you put in jail,

17:00.541 --> 17:03.239
they'd know who you are,
they could go after you.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.067
Tanya, it is not
about that right now.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.808
This is about protecting you.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.723
We have three hours.

17:08.766 --> 17:11.769
We can find Olivia and
her followers before anything
happens to James.

17:13.728 --> 17:17.340
Hey, look, there's no line
at Dance Dance Revolution.

17:17.384 --> 17:18.863
I don't wanna do it.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.691
[sighs] Look.

17:21.649 --> 17:25.696
Ruby, I know you
miss your mom.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.742
And I know
that you're in pain.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.528
Please, let me help you.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.183
You forced me to come here.
I told you I didn't want to.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.576
I know.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.448
Sometimes, when we're in pain,

17:38.492 --> 17:40.581
it can feel like
we're sinking.

17:41.277 --> 17:43.105
Like quicksand.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.629
And experts
in this kind of thing,

17:45.673 --> 17:47.762
they say that
when we are in pain,

17:47.805 --> 17:51.374
the best thing to do
is surround ourselves
with loved ones

17:51.418 --> 17:53.811
who can bring us back to life.

17:53.855 --> 17:57.946
So I'm just trying
to help you.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.078
You're not helping.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.211
I hate it here.
Just take me home.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.083
No, don't take them!

18:05.258 --> 18:07.216
[gunshot sounds]

18:07.260 --> 18:08.826
[loud video game sounds]

18:10.741 --> 18:12.134
No!

18:12.178 --> 18:14.093
You will not harm them!

18:14.963 --> 18:16.138
[grunts]

18:16.182 --> 18:17.444
[Hank Henshaw] Father!

18:19.750 --> 18:22.057
It's all right, Father.
It isn't real.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.233
Who is shooting at us?

18:24.277 --> 18:25.930
Oh, my God. Myr'nn.

18:25.974 --> 18:26.975
Where is your mother?

18:27.018 --> 18:29.195
-Is he okay?
-He's just confused.

18:29.238 --> 18:31.153
Let's get him out of here.
Let's go.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.589
It's okay.

18:34.417 --> 18:37.203
No matches
on any traffic cams
or ATMs throughout the city.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.075
Hey, let's run it
against all open
security feeds.

18:40.119 --> 18:43.122
Olivia was so sweet
and innocent
when I first met her.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.733
And now she's a cult leader.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.302
I can't help but think
this is my fault.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.042
Wait, how?

18:51.086 --> 18:53.349
Coville and his followers
were going to hurt people
in my name,

18:53.393 --> 18:54.698
so I cut my hand

18:54.742 --> 18:56.309
to prove to them
I wasn't a god.

18:56.352 --> 18:58.224
And the second
she saw my vulnerability,

18:58.267 --> 19:00.051
she became disillusioned.

19:00.095 --> 19:03.577
I let my mask down
for one second,
and look what happens.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.927
You can't be all things
to all people.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.016
All you can do
is be true to yourself.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.583
Which self? [chuckles]

19:10.714 --> 19:14.196
I'm supposed to stand
for truth.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.980
How am I supposed
to be truthful?

19:16.024 --> 19:17.330
Really truthful.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.984
Well, if you tell
Lena the truth,

19:20.028 --> 19:22.683
you'd be doing it
to make yourself feel better,
not her.

19:24.859 --> 19:26.687
So maybe, in this case,
it's, uh...

19:28.428 --> 19:30.865
Not telling her the truth
is the noble thing.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.130
It's a sacrifice you're making
to protect her.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.525
Hey, guys.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.091
We found something.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.485
I just finished analyzing
that residue that you found.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.574
What killed the girl
wasn't a bomb at all.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.446
It was caused
by a heavy metal reaction.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.188
A heavy metal
not found on Earth.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.015
[Supergirl gasps]

19:51.059 --> 19:52.191
I've seen this before.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.545
Here.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.460
The Rock of Yuda Kal.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.158
He says he found a statue
of her in Addis Ababa

20:03.202 --> 20:04.638
made of Kryptonian stone.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.814
Yuda Kal, isn't that the
Kryptonian goddess of life?

20:06.857 --> 20:08.424
I don't know anything
about a goddess,

20:08.468 --> 20:10.513
but this is the exact inverse
of what I need to cure Sam.

20:10.557 --> 20:12.472
We were wrong.

20:12.515 --> 20:14.343
They weren't using the rock
to make a bomb,

20:14.387 --> 20:17.303
they're making
a new Worldkiller.

20:17.346 --> 20:20.175
Well, if the Rock of Yuda Kal
can be used
to make a Worldkiller,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.700
we could just reverse
the process
and use it to unmake one.

20:23.744 --> 20:26.094
We could turn Reign
back into Sam permanently.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.661
We can cure her.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.539
James.

20:36.583 --> 20:38.541
What happened?
Was there another attack
at CatCo?

20:38.585 --> 20:40.935
No, no. I'm sorry
to bring Tanya here,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.719
but I figured
with all the threats
out there,

20:42.763 --> 20:44.330
this is the safest place
for her.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.592
Are you all right?

20:45.635 --> 20:47.158
I have decided
to hold a press conference

20:47.202 --> 20:48.421
to reveal that I'm Guardian.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.726
No, you can't do that.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.511
I have to do that.
It's my only choice.

20:51.554 --> 20:52.990
It's already 4 o'clock.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.079
In an hour,
they're gonna out me anyway.

20:55.123 --> 20:56.864
This is the only leverage
they have on me,

20:56.907 --> 20:58.561
so if I can
get out ahead of this,

20:58.605 --> 21:01.434
maybe I can cause them
to shake up their plan

21:01.477 --> 21:03.044
or make a mistake.

21:03.087 --> 21:05.046
Dude, that is just like
that movie Ransom,right?

21:05.089 --> 21:08.092
With the guy, his son
gets kidnapped, and instead
of paying the ransom,

21:08.136 --> 21:09.790
he flips the table.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.182
Spoilers. I just...

21:11.226 --> 21:13.968
-I'm gonna stop.
-They're just... Thank you.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.492
If they use this again,
someone could die.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.233
Or worse.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.626
They can make a Worldkiller.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.281
It's what I have to do.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.329
[Lena] James.

21:29.070 --> 21:30.767
James, if you're doing this,
I'm coming with you.

21:30.811 --> 21:32.247
I wanna stand beside you.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.075
I really appreciate that.

21:34.118 --> 21:35.990
But you should
continue working. Sam's life
depends on it, right?

21:36.904 --> 21:38.775
I know this is scary,

21:38.819 --> 21:40.995
but maybe it's a good thing,
you know, you coming out.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.649
It's a little more complicated
than that.

21:44.128 --> 21:45.173
Why?

21:45.652 --> 21:46.914
[James sighs]

21:49.177 --> 21:51.092
For one, I'm a black man.

21:52.049 --> 21:54.138
But everyone knows
that Guardian's a hero.

21:54.182 --> 21:57.446
Yeah, but not everyone knows
that Guardian is black.

21:57.490 --> 22:01.711
You know how old I was
the first time
cops put cuffs on me?

22:04.497 --> 22:05.802
Seven.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.849
I was seven years old.

22:11.068 --> 22:13.332
My family and I
were taking a vacation.

22:14.681 --> 22:17.988
We were staying
at this nice hotel

22:18.032 --> 22:20.817
and, uh, my cousins and I,
we decided to go out
on the grounds,

22:20.861 --> 22:23.080
and play hide-and-go-seek.

22:24.386 --> 22:28.347
One minute, I'm trying
my damnedest not to be found,

22:28.390 --> 22:32.263
and in the next, I'm shielding
my eyes from police lights.

22:33.830 --> 22:35.876
And these four huge cops,
they came

22:35.919 --> 22:38.008
and they pulled us out
of our hiding places.

22:38.052 --> 22:39.793
And the whole time
we're saying,

22:39.836 --> 22:42.709
"Wait, what are you doing?
We're staying here."

22:44.537 --> 22:47.191
But none of them believed
that we were supposed
to be there.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.021
None of them believed
that we belonged.

22:55.591 --> 22:57.811
So my oldest cousin
must have been about 11,

22:59.552 --> 23:01.858
and I was the smallest.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.731
But they slapped cuffs
on all of us anyway,

23:04.774 --> 23:05.993
and my arms were so little

23:06.036 --> 23:08.256
they had to put them
around my forearms.

23:08.299 --> 23:10.476
And then they marched us
into the hotel lobby

23:10.519 --> 23:11.999
like a bunch of criminals.

23:12.782 --> 23:15.002
And my mom was there.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.265
And then they believed us.
[laughs]

23:19.136 --> 23:22.357
She kept yelling,
"Get those cuffs off my boys."

23:22.401 --> 23:23.793
[voice breaking] Those cuffs.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.752
[shudders]

23:27.754 --> 23:29.277
James, that's horrible.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.757
Yeah.

23:37.111 --> 23:40.157
Racism is the oldest form
of bullying.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.290
I'm so sorry that happened
to you.

23:43.813 --> 23:46.903
But when I became Guardian,
I put that mask on...

23:48.949 --> 23:51.125
It was strangely liberating.

23:51.168 --> 23:55.434
But it was the first time
in my life

23:55.477 --> 23:59.263
that I had the opportunity
to be judged on my actions

23:59.307 --> 24:00.439
and my heart,

24:01.614 --> 24:02.919
not how I look.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.052
You shouldn't have
to wear a mask

24:05.095 --> 24:06.749
to be seen
as how you really are, James.

24:06.793 --> 24:08.447
Just, it shouldn't
be that way.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.449
But it is.

24:19.327 --> 24:20.633
And it's like that

24:20.676 --> 24:22.417
for every seven-year-old boy
who looks like me,

24:22.461 --> 24:24.985
but it's not gonna
be like that if I have
something to do with it.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.378
You will effect change.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.337
You already are.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.996
Are you sure you wanna
come out in the open?

24:36.039 --> 24:38.607
I don't think anybody likes
to be backed into a corner,

24:38.651 --> 24:40.740
especially not me.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.482
And I don't know
how people are gonna react

24:43.525 --> 24:46.485
when they realize that their
neighborhood vigilante
is black.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.578
But there's just too much
at stake for me not to.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.894
[Tanya]
I'm sorry to interrupt.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.942
Can I talk to you
for a second?

25:08.985 --> 25:10.334
Yeah, of course.

25:13.468 --> 25:14.556
Thank you.

25:20.214 --> 25:22.303
You don't have
to reveal yourself for me.

25:23.086 --> 25:25.175
I'm gonna give myself up.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.438
I wanna face them.
I wanna fight.

25:27.482 --> 25:28.483
No, no, Tanya.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.050
It is way too dangerous
for that.

25:30.093 --> 25:32.139
No, I need to do this.

25:32.182 --> 25:36.404
For once, I need to take
a risk and stand up
for what I believe.

25:38.711 --> 25:40.495
I need to be myself.

25:42.018 --> 25:43.585
Well, you're not doing
this alone.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.023
This was a bad idea.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.199
A very bad idea. I'm sorry.

25:49.243 --> 25:51.898
[sighs] I should've known
the stimulation
would be too much.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.204
I am burning those books.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.423
Yeah.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.861
Oh, right.
I've gotta go deal
with this guy.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.385
-Why don't you go get the car?
-Okay.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.474
Uh, stay seated, Dad.

26:04.824 --> 26:06.477
Ruby, can you please stay
with Myr'nn?

26:12.483 --> 26:13.528
What is this?

26:13.572 --> 26:14.703
A foosball.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.400
Foosball.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.011
Strange material.

26:18.054 --> 26:20.622
Buoyant, light substance.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.884
It's made of cork.

26:21.928 --> 26:23.103
What is cork?

26:23.625 --> 26:25.192
I'm not sure.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.063
I think it's made from trees.

26:27.107 --> 26:29.500
We do not have cork trees
on Mars.

26:29.544 --> 26:30.893
Mars?

26:30.937 --> 26:32.634
Wait, you're from Mars?

26:32.678 --> 26:34.201
Of course.

26:34.244 --> 26:35.202
Really?

26:35.245 --> 26:36.595
Wait.
What's it like there?

26:37.770 --> 26:42.296
It was once a place
of great nobility.

26:42.339 --> 26:45.386
People lived simply,
yet with joy.

26:46.082 --> 26:47.693
I long for that place.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.173
What happened?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.307
War.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.788
My family was killed.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.355
A very long time ago.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
How did you recover?

27:01.663 --> 27:03.317
I mean, after that happened.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.712
Faith.

27:06.755 --> 27:09.976
I believed if my heart
remained pure,

27:10.019 --> 27:13.022
H'ronmeer would provide
for me.

27:13.066 --> 27:15.503
It was difficult,
but I was strong.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.636
Like you.

27:17.679 --> 27:20.073
H'ronmeer is like
a god on Mars?

27:20.116 --> 27:21.422
[Myr'nn chuckles]

27:22.553 --> 27:23.729
Did he come through?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.514
He brought me back my son.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.214
What is the purpose
of foosball?

27:31.911 --> 27:33.260
I can show you.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.002
Thank you.

27:38.831 --> 27:40.223
Where did they go?

27:41.529 --> 27:43.313
Father?

27:43.357 --> 27:45.141
[Myr'nn laughs]
My little man hit it!

27:45.185 --> 27:47.056
[Ruby] You scored a goal.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.102
I love the foosball.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.759
Yes! No.

27:53.802 --> 27:54.847
Yes!

27:54.890 --> 27:56.239
[exclaims]

28:00.809 --> 28:02.289
[Winn over comms]
Don't worry.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.725
As soon as you
turn yourself over,
he will find you.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.596
Okay.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.902
Be safe.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.469
I will.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.866
You have decided
to come back to us.

28:13.909 --> 28:15.694
I wasn't given a choice.

28:28.489 --> 28:29.533
[Mon-El] Awesome.

28:29.577 --> 28:32.232
This is, uh,
this is for Mike, right?

28:32.580 --> 28:33.668
Oh.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.062
Sorry.

28:36.105 --> 28:38.020
I'm pretty sure
this is my lift.

28:38.064 --> 28:39.587
We're kind of in the middle
of something, guy.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.201
Oh. Whoa.
Wait, are you...

28:45.245 --> 28:46.986
Are you guys kidnapping
this woman?

28:47.029 --> 28:48.117
Just get out.

28:48.161 --> 28:49.249
That is, okay.

28:49.292 --> 28:51.512
That's a highly illegal
situation,

28:51.555 --> 28:53.122
and I'm gonna have
to insist that...

28:53.819 --> 28:55.559
Okay. Yeah.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.300
I'm not scared of you.

28:57.344 --> 28:59.085
I'm very scared of you.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.392
So, should we put
some music on, or...

29:02.436 --> 29:03.829
[groans]

29:03.872 --> 29:05.265
-Let's go.
-[engine starts]

29:06.266 --> 29:08.529
Uh, you guys,
uh, we cannot track them.

29:08.572 --> 29:11.227
The van has some sort
of scrambler on it.

29:11.271 --> 29:13.186
We lost comms, too.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.753
[dramatic music playing]

29:18.191 --> 29:19.758
Should've never let Tanya go.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.065
Wait, wait.
If they use the rock,

29:23.109 --> 29:25.328
then it will give off
an energy signal.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.895
Which we can scan for.

29:26.939 --> 29:28.157
Wouldn't that get us there

29:28.201 --> 29:29.680
after they've already
made a Worldkiller?

29:29.724 --> 29:32.205
Don't worry, there's a reason
we sent Mon-El with her.

29:32.248 --> 29:35.121
He's smart, tactical,
he's a legionnaire.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.776
If anyone can find us
a signal, it's him.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.647
-[handcuffs clicking]
-Owie.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.128
We'll deal with you
after the ceremony's done.

29:44.304 --> 29:47.002
-Just one question.
-[handcuffs clanking]

29:47.046 --> 29:49.700
Do you by chance know
where I can find
the Rock of Yuda Kal?

29:51.790 --> 29:52.878
[grunting]

29:53.530 --> 29:54.880
So, no?

30:01.103 --> 30:02.844
You guys have
no cell phones in cults?

30:04.890 --> 30:09.198
[Tanya] "Into the flame,
one oronc of Sedenach dust.

30:18.338 --> 30:21.428
The final element
is seven lak-mar of..."

30:23.691 --> 30:24.692
[Olivia] Of what?

30:32.874 --> 30:33.832
Nitrogen.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.708
[tense music playing]

30:52.415 --> 30:55.505
Before the leaders of Krypton
erased her

30:56.855 --> 30:57.856
with Rao,

30:58.900 --> 31:00.597
with their science,

31:01.685 --> 31:03.209
there was a goddess

31:04.558 --> 31:05.776
of life,

31:07.561 --> 31:08.562
of birth.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.392
Yuda Kal.

31:13.306 --> 31:16.135
The faithful gathered
in her orpheum

31:16.178 --> 31:18.615
in tribute, as we are now.

31:18.659 --> 31:21.792
And she will give us
one final birth.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.119
Worldkiller.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.425
There it is.

31:49.385 --> 31:50.560
[high-pitched screeching]

31:50.604 --> 31:52.649
-What is it?
-Kryptonian Sunstone.

31:52.693 --> 31:55.261
Mon-El found a frequency
I can hear. Let's go.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.697
Uh, James. [sighs]

31:57.785 --> 31:58.917
Safety first.

31:59.743 --> 32:01.571
[laughs]

32:01.615 --> 32:03.486
With the power of Yuda Kal,

32:05.097 --> 32:06.620
I will be the fourth.

32:12.887 --> 32:13.975
[gasps]

32:14.019 --> 32:15.455
[cultists exclaiming]

32:17.022 --> 32:18.414
The false god.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.677
Right on cue.

32:33.734 --> 32:34.778
[grunting]

32:36.476 --> 32:38.086
[cultists yelling]

32:38.130 --> 32:39.566
[all grunting]

32:52.492 --> 32:54.320
This is not you, Olivia.

32:54.363 --> 32:56.278
The girl I saved
was a good person.

32:56.322 --> 32:57.584
The girl you saved was weak.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.455
Now I finish Reign's work.

33:05.244 --> 33:06.462
[man] Move.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.427
[all grunting]

33:29.224 --> 33:30.530
[groaning]

33:36.362 --> 33:37.928
[Mon-El grunting]

33:39.756 --> 33:40.757
[screams]

33:47.373 --> 33:49.070
Wait, Olivia,
let me just say this.

33:50.376 --> 33:51.942
You once believed in me.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.859
You thought I saved you
for a reason, and I did.

33:55.903 --> 33:58.036
I saved you so that
you could have a life.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.820
This is a life.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.604
No, this is
someone else's life.

34:01.648 --> 34:04.042
This is Coville's life.

34:05.913 --> 34:09.699
I know what it's like
to not know which role
you have to play.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.790
But you have so much
to offer this world.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.444
So much.

34:16.967 --> 34:18.578
And this is not it.

34:19.144 --> 34:20.406
But...

34:21.233 --> 34:22.930
Who am I without it?

34:26.325 --> 34:27.630
[grunts]

34:28.153 --> 34:30.285
Let go of that rock,

34:30.329 --> 34:32.592
and you'll have a lifetime
to figure it out.

34:40.730 --> 34:41.992
[sizzling]

34:45.779 --> 34:48.086
-What's wrong?
-I can't get it...

34:48.129 --> 34:49.739
I can't get it.

34:50.653 --> 34:52.916
-Help me.
-I can't touch it.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.049
[Olivia] Please, help! [cries]
[Supergirl] Mon-El.

34:55.919 --> 34:57.921
Help.

34:57.965 --> 35:01.403
[sobbing]
Please, please, please.
Get it off, please.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.101
It won't budge.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.015
Olivia, this is gonna hurt.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.018
[Olivia screaming]

35:11.805 --> 35:13.154
-[cries out in pain]
-Let me see, let me see.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.420
-You're okay.
-[sobbing]

35:18.464 --> 35:19.943
You're okay.

35:21.119 --> 35:23.077
I'm sorry.

35:24.078 --> 35:25.123
It's okay.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.397
[sirens wailing]

35:38.440 --> 35:39.659
[James] Hey there.

35:41.443 --> 35:44.142
I just wanted to apologize
for putting you
in a tough position

35:44.185 --> 35:45.273
with Lena earlier.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.753
Oh, it's fine.

35:46.796 --> 35:48.058
I did it.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.191
I asked you to do something
I shouldn't have.

35:50.235 --> 35:52.062
I knew
there were consequences.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.542
I do understand

35:53.586 --> 35:55.849
the complex issues
about your identity.

35:56.937 --> 35:58.460
But I gotta tell you,
there was a moment

35:58.504 --> 36:00.549
when I decided to unmask today

36:02.029 --> 36:03.509
where I felt powerful.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.729
Don't get me wrong,

36:06.773 --> 36:09.036
I was definitely afraid

36:09.079 --> 36:12.213
of what changes may come
or how people may perceive me,

36:12.257 --> 36:13.823
or the fallout.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.872
But I wanted to fight
that good fight,

36:19.916 --> 36:21.831
because I think people
like Tanya

36:21.875 --> 36:23.659
need to see heroes who look
like me

36:23.703 --> 36:25.226
so they know
what they're capable of.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.662
Yeah.

36:26.706 --> 36:29.274
So when the time is right,
on my own terms,

36:30.797 --> 36:32.233
I'm gonna take that mask off.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.280
I'm proud of you.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.195
That's my story.

36:38.370 --> 36:39.719
Yours is different.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.200
You can't take yours off

36:44.027 --> 36:45.942
because you're doing it
to protect us,

36:47.553 --> 36:48.945
the people you care about.

36:49.598 --> 36:51.165
I know it takes its toll.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.907
Well... [chuckles]

36:53.950 --> 36:57.563
But I'm here to tell you
that I respect it.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.260
I understand it.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.609
I appreciate it.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.263
Thank you.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.659
Come here.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.227
And now
for the big reveal.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.360
-Ta-da!
-It looks so good.

37:12.404 --> 37:13.492
I love it so much.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.928
-Yeah?
-You did such a good job.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.712
Well, thank you.

37:16.756 --> 37:18.845
At least I know now that
if this whole FBI thing
doesn't work out,

37:18.888 --> 37:20.586
I have a calling
as a hairdresser.

37:23.502 --> 37:25.939
I'm sorry I was so rude
to you before, Alex.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.597
No, I, um...

37:31.640 --> 37:34.077
I'm sorry that
I kept pushing you
to feel better

37:34.121 --> 37:35.731
before you were ready.

37:35.775 --> 37:39.300
But I'm really happy
that you taught Myr'nn

37:39.344 --> 37:40.736
how to play foosball.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.305
How long has he been sick?

37:45.263 --> 37:46.655
Not very long.

37:47.482 --> 37:48.701
A few months.

37:49.615 --> 37:51.399
But he's very old,

37:51.443 --> 37:54.315
like hundreds of years old.

37:54.359 --> 37:57.318
Do you think J'onn
ever worries about
what happened to his father

37:57.362 --> 37:58.363
will happen to him?

38:00.539 --> 38:01.801
I don't know.

38:05.674 --> 38:10.766
Are you worried that
what happened to your mom
might happen to you?

38:15.467 --> 38:17.120
I wish, more than anything,

38:17.164 --> 38:19.558
that I could
take this burden from you.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.124
I really wish
that I could tell you

38:21.168 --> 38:23.301
that you never have
to worry about that.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.826
But the truth is...

38:29.568 --> 38:30.873
I don't know.

38:32.658 --> 38:34.964
But I'll tell you
what I do know.

38:35.008 --> 38:38.751
Some of the smartest people
on the planet love your mom.

38:38.794 --> 38:42.015
And they're working
day and night to find a cure.

38:42.711 --> 38:44.322
And those very same people,

38:45.410 --> 38:47.020
they love you.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.675
And I give you my word, Ruby,

38:49.718 --> 38:54.201
I will fight to protect you
as long as I live.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.901
[Supergirl] Have you started?

38:58.945 --> 39:01.077
No. The rock you brought us
was drained of all its power.

39:01.121 --> 39:03.166
Yeah, it all went
to Olivia's transformation.

39:03.210 --> 39:06.300
How come the two of you
don't seem too devastated
by that news?

39:06.344 --> 39:09.347
Because Ms. Luthor and I
very intelligently recorded

39:09.390 --> 39:10.957
the radiation signature
of the sacred stone

39:11.000 --> 39:12.132
during the cult's ritual.

39:12.175 --> 39:14.743
And with a little scan
of the heavens,

39:15.744 --> 39:17.572
the heavens obliged.

39:17.616 --> 39:18.965
Now, it is very rare,

39:19.008 --> 39:21.271
but the exact same rock
is hurdling through space

39:21.315 --> 39:23.491
on a meteorite
about five light-years away.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.580
J'onn, can your ship
make it that far?

39:25.624 --> 39:27.843
Tuned up the FTL drive
a couple of weeks ago.

39:27.887 --> 39:29.018
I could go with you.

39:29.062 --> 39:31.194
No, no, you have to stay
with your father.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.066
[Mon-El] I'll go.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.503
The Yuda Kal rock seems
to have some kind of effect
on Supergirl,

39:35.547 --> 39:36.939
but I can handle it fine.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.812
[loud crashing,
objects clattering]

39:44.512 --> 39:46.427
[Winn stammers]
She's out of bed.
She broke the chains.

39:46.471 --> 39:48.211
How'd she do that?

39:48.255 --> 39:50.344
That Kryptonite
is supposed to keep her weak.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.781
Her body's adapting,
like Pestilence
to the anti-virus.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.304
She's becoming immune.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.741
How long till you won't
be able to keep her contained?

39:55.784 --> 39:57.220
I don't know.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.571
A couple of days.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.007
Then we better get a move on.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.361
Thank you for going
with Supergirl

40:07.405 --> 40:09.407
and allowing me to stay
with my father.

40:09.450 --> 40:10.756
Oh, yeah, of course.

40:10.799 --> 40:12.627
Although I sense there's more
to your decision

40:12.671 --> 40:14.281
than just the mission
to stop Reign.

40:15.587 --> 40:18.459
Yeah, well, I spoke to Imra,

40:18.503 --> 40:21.897
and it turns out despite
all of my attempts
to bury my feelings,

40:21.941 --> 40:24.073
it was pretty transparent
for her,

40:24.117 --> 40:25.901
so she told me
to come back here
and sort it out.

40:25.945 --> 40:29.122
And all I wanna do
is just tell Kara
exactly how I feel.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.691
'Cause I don't wanna
keep secrets.

40:32.734 --> 40:34.780
Telling her
might make you feel better,

40:35.781 --> 40:37.260
but I think
it would be selfish.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.828
Yeah, I know.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.875
You grew older in the future,

40:42.918 --> 40:45.704
but you also grew wiser.

40:45.747 --> 40:47.140
[both chuckle]

40:47.836 --> 40:49.490
You're doing the right thing.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.013
I appreciate you saying that.

40:51.492 --> 40:52.537
Thank you.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.755
You ready?

40:53.799 --> 40:57.324
Yeah, uh, let's go
get us a rock.

40:58.194 --> 40:59.413
Bangarang.

41:05.419 --> 41:06.768
Home by midnight, Dad.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.335
[Hank Henshaw chuckles]

41:08.378 --> 41:09.554
[engine starts]

41:10.468 --> 41:11.991
[dramatic music playing]

41:28.442 --> 41:29.487
[officer] Hey.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.319
This is a crime scene.
You can't be here.

41:37.973 --> 41:39.801
Are you okay, buddy?

41:39.845 --> 41:42.500
Actually,
I've never been better.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.110
[ominous music playing]

41:49.594 --> 41:51.596
[theme music playing]
