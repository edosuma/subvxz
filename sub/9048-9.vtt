how to handle this situation.

the first half of senior year

00:23.548 --> 00:25.815
I'd improved my GPA,
beefed up my resume,

00:25.817 --> 00:27.450
and written a dynamic
personal statement

00:27.452 --> 00:30.453

which was due by midnight.

about your essay.

00:35.894 --> 00:39.028
You should pick a cool font
or a color that pops.

00:39.030 --> 00:41.998
It'll really make
your application stand out.

I already asked Luke

00:48.406 --> 00:49.439

two years ago,

00:49.441 --> 00:51.107

if it's good enough or not.

00:51.109 --> 00:55.845
- So you gonna accept my offer
or keep playing hard to get?

00:55.847 --> 00:58.781
- Your dad asked me
to friend him.

00:58.783 --> 00:59.882
- Social networking, Dad?

00:59.884 --> 01:02.585
So it's not just
some stupid fad anymore?

01:02.587 --> 01:03.319

01:13.998 --> 01:14.731

01:14.733 --> 01:18.801
My mom thinks writing "call me"
on my wall is texting.

01:18.803 --> 01:20.837
Now, about your essay.

01:20.839 --> 01:22.472
I read it
with a very critical eye.

01:22.474 --> 01:23.339
- Okay, don't edit yourself.

01:23.341 --> 01:24.373
If it's terrible,
I need to know.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.409
Although if it is terrible,
I actually don't want to know,

01:26.411 --> 01:27.543
because that would mean
instead of college,

01:27.545 --> 01:29.912
I have to spend my entire life
in this house with my parents.

01:29.914 --> 01:30.747
Should I change the font?

01:30.749 --> 01:33.316

but now it's my turn.

01:33.318 --> 01:34.951
It's good.

01:34.953 --> 01:35.618

You're definitely college

to Christ-centered schools:

02:17.095 --> 02:18.828
Vanderbilt, Baylor,
and Brigham Young.

02:18.830 --> 02:20.530
Mormons aren't
really Christians,

02:20.532 --> 02:21.798
but Utah seems neat.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.566
And since they all worship
a false prophet

02:23.568 --> 02:24.467
and are going straight to hell,

02:24.469 --> 02:26.235
I figured I could get
more me time with Jesus.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.084
Ever since Matty got arrested,

03:48.086 --> 03:49.619
he had been throwing attitude
my way.

03:57.095 --> 03:58.928

04:00.198 --> 04:02.732

Connected.

04:02.734 --> 04:04.667
- We both knew she meant sex.

04:04.669 --> 04:05.234
Still good.

04:05.236 --> 04:06.936
- If us being together
bothers you,

04:06.938 --> 04:07.870
I'd shut it down.

04:07.872 --> 04:09.138
You mean that much to me.

04:09.140 --> 04:10.640

was lose-lose:

He's such a romantic.

04:29.127 --> 04:30.192
But why am I telling you that?

04:30.194 --> 04:32.862
He's probably taken you out
to a million romantic dinners.

04:32.864 --> 04:36.132
- Well, if he mentions Reseda,
don't overdress.

04:36.134 --> 04:37.366

04:37.368 --> 04:38.801

would be a crime.

God, I think the stress
of going to my reunion

04:54.452 --> 04:56.485

a little.

04:56.487 --> 04:57.186

07:32.009 --> 07:34.877
will be wowed by
my squeaky-clean online persona.

07:34.879 --> 07:36.679
Let's see
what we're working with.

07:36.681 --> 07:37.613
- The most disturbing shots

07:37.615 --> 07:39.515
weren't the ones
I was caught doing poolside.

07:39.517 --> 07:41.217
They were the ones
with Matty by my side.

07:41.219 --> 07:44.553
My complicated past was still
attached to my present

07:44.555 --> 07:47.256
and in need
of some serious scrubbing.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.358
- This is going to be
a hellish ordeal,

07:49.360 --> 07:51.560
so I need both of you
to stay out of my way

07:51.562 --> 07:54.930
and obey every order I give you
to the letter!

07:54.932 --> 07:55.898
- Wow, you're really feeling

07:55.900 --> 07:58.634
this whole German thing,
aren't you?

07:58.636 --> 08:00.302
- You are half an hour late.

08:00.304 --> 08:01.637
Now, fire up that grill stat!

08:01.639 --> 08:05.141
- I told you, I have
Friday class and might be late.

08:05.143 --> 08:07.910
You should listen
when I tell you stuff, Sadita.

08:07.912 --> 08:09.011
- Do not call me that,

08:09.013 --> 08:11.447
and keep your cholo hands
off me,

08:11.449 --> 08:12.948
<i>comprende,</i> Sergio?

08:12.950 --> 08:14.049
- Are we serving cholos
tonight?

08:14.051 --> 08:17.019
- That's actionable
sexual harassment, you pig.

08:17.021 --> 08:19.255
- Sticking that big ole
sexy-ass booty in my face

08:19.257 --> 08:21.056
is what constitutes
sexual harassment.

08:21.058 --> 08:24.260
And, <i>blanquita,</i> if I was
sexually harassing you,

08:24.262 --> 08:26.495
trust me, you'd know.

08:26.497 --> 08:29.064
- Uh, why do I have to wear
the lederhosen and he doesn't?

08:29.066 --> 08:32.301
- Because Sergio would
look stupid in lederhosen.

08:32.303 --> 08:33.836
- And I don't?

08:33.838 --> 08:34.537
- No, you do.

08:34.539 --> 08:37.006
Now, everyone,
get back to [bleep] work!

08:37.008 --> 08:38.841
- ♪ Let me hear you say

08:38.843 --> 08:40.042
♪

08:40.044 --> 08:41.577
♪ let me hear you say

08:41.579 --> 08:45.281
♪

08:45.283 --> 08:47.650
- Val, get in here.

08:47.652 --> 08:49.585
You can do this.
Come on.

08:53.690 --> 08:56.158
- I feel naked
without my fanny pack.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.960
Wait. Am I naked?
People are staring.

08:57.962 --> 09:02.531
- Nope.
They are checking you out.

09:02.533 --> 09:03.566
- Hey.

09:03.568 --> 09:04.433
This is weird.

09:04.435 --> 09:05.434
I don't recognize you two,

09:05.436 --> 09:08.270
and I do not forget
beautiful women.

09:08.272 --> 09:09.071
[all laugh]

09:09.073 --> 09:11.874
- Well, I actually
didn't go here.

09:11.876 --> 09:13.676
I'm with my friend Val,
who did.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.679
- Clearly I smoked
too much dope in high school.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.013
- [laughing]
Stop.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.715
Who didn't?

09:19.717 --> 09:21.217
I do remember you, though.

09:21.219 --> 09:23.719
You're Stevie Shay.

09:23.721 --> 09:26.255
- You know, my girl here
planned the whole reunion.

09:26.257 --> 09:28.490
- Cool.
- No, no, it was no trouble.

09:28.492 --> 09:30.326
I just booked the room
nine months ago.

09:30.328 --> 09:32.261
Then I confirmed it
six months ago.

09:32.263 --> 09:34.296
And then I picked out
the gold tablecloths

09:34.298 --> 09:34.964
three months ago--

09:34.966 --> 09:37.233
- Dempster!
You sick bastard.

09:37.235 --> 09:40.402
Ooh!
- Val-Gina?

09:40.404 --> 09:42.371
Oh, it is you!

09:42.373 --> 09:45.374
Wow, you look really good.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.609
Good for you.

09:46.611 --> 09:47.509
Admit it, though.

09:47.511 --> 09:49.111
You've had work done.

09:49.113 --> 09:50.079
- Bunion surgery.

09:50.081 --> 09:51.380
Thanks for noticing.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.181
- [laughing]
Oh, God.

09:52.183 --> 09:55.184
You're still that same old
kooky Val-Gina.

09:55.186 --> 09:56.952
[laughs]

09:59.022 --> 09:59.555
- Val-Gina?

09:59.557 --> 10:03.058
- Erica started a rumor
that I was a hermaphrodite.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.193
I need a hug.

10:04.195 --> 10:06.295
- No, you don't.

10:06.297 --> 10:08.497
You need lip gloss.

10:08.499 --> 10:13.569
- Look smart, like you're
really interested in it.

10:15.872 --> 10:19.575
You're studying.
You're solving.

10:19.577 --> 10:20.542
Difficult.

10:20.544 --> 10:21.677
Act like you solved it.

10:21.679 --> 10:23.579
- I'm trying.

10:23.581 --> 10:24.013
- Stop!

10:24.015 --> 10:25.914
- Well, it's solved.
- Jenna!

10:25.916 --> 10:26.582
- It's solved.

10:26.584 --> 10:29.018
- I'm not gonna remember
what I wrote.

10:31.121 --> 10:32.421
That one's really good.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.722
- Mm, I like it.

10:33.724 --> 10:36.091
[doorbell rings]

10:38.795 --> 10:39.828
- Surprise!

10:39.830 --> 10:41.363
Let's go out and celebrate
your apps going in.

10:41.365 --> 10:44.166
Friday night is
jazz under the stars at LACMA.

10:44.168 --> 10:44.967
- You are perfection.

10:44.969 --> 10:47.670
Oh, check out what Tamara did
for my online profile.

10:47.672 --> 10:50.005
She is totally saving my ass.

10:50.007 --> 10:50.572
- Hey, Tamara.

10:50.574 --> 10:53.042
I hear you're saving
a very nice ass.

10:53.044 --> 10:54.076
- We were just finishing up.

10:54.078 --> 10:55.644
I'll go get my stuff.

10:55.646 --> 10:57.479
- T!

10:58.548 --> 10:59.915
T, wait.

11:01.284 --> 11:02.651
Where are you going?

11:02.653 --> 11:03.552
- I can do the math.

11:03.554 --> 11:05.921
T minus BF equals third wheel.

11:05.923 --> 11:08.023
And that's sagic--

11:08.025 --> 11:09.892
sadly tragic.

11:14.030 --> 11:14.963
- Looks great.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.098
Lots to celebrate.

11:16.100 --> 11:16.598
- Listen,

11:16.600 --> 11:17.933
I really don't want
to bail on T.

11:17.935 --> 11:20.769
We sort of had
a girls' night planned.

11:22.238 --> 11:24.273
- Then how about
we bag the concert

11:24.275 --> 11:26.809
and I take you both
for a quick fro-yo?

11:26.811 --> 11:29.178
- Mm.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.412
Hey, put that bag down.

11:30.414 --> 11:32.581
Luke is taking us out
for fro-yo

11:32.583 --> 11:33.449
and then ditching.

11:33.451 --> 11:35.617
Bestie festie is back on.

11:36.553 --> 11:38.287
- Truth is, I don't like jazz
nearly as much

11:38.289 --> 11:40.589
as I like being a guy
who says he likes jazz.

11:40.591 --> 11:43.726
- Then let's put the cherry
on top of your new brand:

11:43.728 --> 11:44.927
The BF/GF photo.

11:44.929 --> 11:46.462
Cuddle up.

11:47.731 --> 11:49.431
- I hope this place is okay.

11:49.433 --> 11:52.101
I met the chef last year
in Vegas on New Year's Eve,

11:52.103 --> 11:54.436
and he's been hounding me
to come by.

11:54.438 --> 11:56.305
- Yeah, looks great.

11:56.673 --> 11:59.575
I can't believe Jenna
still hasn't sent that email.

11:59.577 --> 12:01.977
- I know.
What is up with her?

12:01.979 --> 12:05.147
But forget about that now.

12:05.149 --> 12:07.383
We are celebrating.

12:07.385 --> 12:10.252
Okay, big smile.

12:10.254 --> 12:12.688
- How about some strudel
while we wait?

12:12.690 --> 12:13.555
- Yes, sir.

12:13.557 --> 12:15.257
Just a few more minutes.

12:15.259 --> 12:15.791
How much longer?

12:15.793 --> 12:18.193
- Sadita's so used
to hanging out the window

12:18.195 --> 12:19.294
sweet-talking all the customers,

12:19.296 --> 12:21.130
she isn't any good
at firing up a sausage.

12:21.132 --> 12:24.600
- Sergio, I will grind
your sausage and feed it to--

12:24.602 --> 12:25.834
- hey, whoa, whoa!
Just a second.

12:25.836 --> 12:29.938
- Jesus, how long does it take
to make a frickin' hot dog?

12:30.573 --> 12:34.042
- Do you know what happens
when you eat undercooked pork?

12:34.044 --> 12:37.679
Bon appétit, butthole.

12:37.681 --> 12:38.714
- What's wrong, Matty?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.649
- Hard to celebrate
our apps going in

12:40.651 --> 12:41.750
when mine aren't in.

12:41.752 --> 12:44.520
I can't believe Jenna
would screw me over like this.

12:44.522 --> 12:47.956
- It's almost like she's trying
to sabotage you or something.

12:47.958 --> 12:48.624
But why?

12:48.626 --> 12:49.758
I mean, she's so nice.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.796
I can't ever believe she would
try to hurt you on purpose.

12:53.798 --> 12:54.930
Would she?

12:54.932 --> 12:56.231
- She has before.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.700
- Well, whatever with her.

12:58.702 --> 13:00.068
Look!
We already got 20 likes.

13:00.070 --> 13:04.973
Oh, guess we know what Jenna's
so busy with right now.

13:07.877 --> 13:08.410
- What the hell?

13:08.412 --> 13:10.579
Jenna can't be bothered
to send me my essay,

13:10.581 --> 13:12.581
but she has time for yogurt.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.316
- God, I'm so sorry.

13:14.318 --> 13:15.217
- Let's get out of here, Eva.

13:15.219 --> 13:18.187
I'm suddenly in the mood
for dessert.

13:19.722 --> 13:21.457
- Don't let one person
ruin your night.

13:21.459 --> 13:22.958
There's Stevie over there.

13:22.960 --> 13:23.792
Go ask him what he does.

13:23.794 --> 13:26.395
Guys love to talk
about themselves.

13:26.397 --> 13:29.398
Hey, surprise yourself.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.701
Yeah. You got it.
Go.

13:35.038 --> 13:36.738
- So, Stevie,

13:36.740 --> 13:38.540
what's your occup--

13:38.542 --> 13:40.742
what do--what do you--
what do you do?

13:40.744 --> 13:41.977
- Oh, hey.

13:41.979 --> 13:43.245
High school gym teacher.

13:43.247 --> 13:44.813
Getting paid to be a jock.

13:44.815 --> 13:45.581
- That is so cool.

13:45.583 --> 13:46.915
I'm a high school counselor.

13:46.917 --> 13:49.585
Getting paid to be a counselor.

13:49.587 --> 13:51.920
These are actually
some of my peeps.

13:51.922 --> 13:53.422
Yo, Sadie, smells good!

13:53.424 --> 13:54.423
- [bleep] Off!

13:54.425 --> 13:55.591
- You got it!

13:55.593 --> 13:56.458
Just love kids.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.827
You know, makes me feel like
I'm back in high school.

13:58.829 --> 14:02.097
- I thought high school
kind of sucked for you.

14:02.099 --> 14:02.631
- Yeah.

14:02.633 --> 14:04.299
Yeah, it did,
maybe a skosh,

14:04.301 --> 14:07.469
but I got to tell you,
now I love it.

14:07.471 --> 14:08.170
- That's awesome.

14:08.172 --> 14:10.906
Hey, I was afraid this party
would be kind of lame,

14:10.908 --> 14:12.007
so I got a room.

14:12.009 --> 14:12.441
- Yes.

14:12.443 --> 14:14.877
- You want to see it?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

14:17.413 --> 14:19.181
Okay.

14:19.183 --> 14:19.882
- So just to be clear,

14:19.884 --> 14:24.520
this is not a good picture
for my profile.

14:24.522 --> 14:25.420
- Definitely not.

14:25.422 --> 14:28.690
- But could be listed
under special talents.

14:28.692 --> 14:33.428
- So is there a reason why
you haven't sent me my essay?

14:33.430 --> 14:34.596
- Hi to you too.

14:34.598 --> 14:36.031
I sent it hours ago.

14:36.033 --> 14:36.532
- Really?

14:36.534 --> 14:38.133
I'd like to go to college,
Jenna.

14:38.135 --> 14:39.034
I want my essay now.

14:39.036 --> 14:40.269
- Well, I'm sorry, Matty,

14:40.271 --> 14:41.403
but I am with my boyfriend

14:41.405 --> 14:42.070
and my best friend.

14:42.072 --> 14:44.106
I will send it to you again
when I get home.

14:44.108 --> 14:46.808
- What am I supposed
to do till then?

14:46.810 --> 14:48.377
- Not my problem.
- It's okay, Matty.

14:48.379 --> 14:50.078
We can just hang some more.
I don't mind.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.580
- Do you have any clue how
selfish you're being right now?

14:51.582 --> 14:53.849
- Okay, man, that's enough.
She'll send it to you later.

14:53.851 --> 14:57.019
- This is awk-weird.
Jenna, we can just go.

14:57.021 --> 14:57.819
- You know what?

14:57.821 --> 14:58.554
No, we're staying,

14:58.556 --> 15:00.155
'cause we are having
a great time.

15:00.157 --> 15:01.423
Matty, you want your essay
so bad?

15:01.425 --> 15:03.191
Why don't you go
and get it yourself?

15:03.193 --> 15:04.426
You know where the key is.

15:04.428 --> 15:05.160
- Fine. I will.

15:05.162 --> 15:06.895
Thank you for your help, Jenna,

15:06.897 --> 15:07.529
all of it.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.598
- You're so welcome, Matty.

15:14.537 --> 15:15.671
- This has onions.

15:15.673 --> 15:16.672
I ordered sauerkraut.

15:16.674 --> 15:18.473
- What, are you worried
about your breath?

15:18.475 --> 15:21.476
Because in that ugly sweater
and those bogo frump pumps,

15:21.478 --> 15:22.678
the chances of you
getting any tonight

15:22.680 --> 15:25.514
are as dead as the sow
that bratwurst came from.

15:25.516 --> 15:25.914
- Sadie!

15:25.916 --> 15:30.352
Stop being such
a mean, nasty bitch!

15:30.354 --> 15:33.388
[cheers and applause]

15:33.390 --> 15:35.958
Please accept this
on the house.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.994
- Thank you.

15:38.996 --> 15:40.228
- Nice.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.863
- Thanks.

15:41.865 --> 15:42.798
Stay in the back,

15:42.800 --> 15:45.767
and keep those brats
coming double time, Sadie,

15:45.769 --> 15:48.670
or Jake and I are leaving.

15:48.672 --> 15:50.372
- What happened to you?

15:50.374 --> 15:53.208
- I just got back
from bone town.

15:53.210 --> 15:54.443
- You didn't!

15:54.445 --> 15:55.811
- No, I didn't.

15:55.813 --> 15:57.279
I don't think I did.

15:57.281 --> 15:58.580
Wait. If he...

15:58.582 --> 16:00.015
- That doesn't count.

16:00.017 --> 16:01.717
- Okay, what if I...

16:01.719 --> 16:03.085
- Not even a base.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.086
- Oh, thank God!

16:04.088 --> 16:04.987
He was so boring.

16:04.989 --> 16:08.023
Not even close to the Stevie
I fantasized about.

16:08.025 --> 16:10.092
He didn't ask me
one question about myself.

16:10.094 --> 16:13.662
If that's the kind of man
that supermodel Val attracts,

16:13.664 --> 16:15.397
I'm going back
to the real Val.

16:15.399 --> 16:18.567
- For the record,
I kind of love the real Val.

16:18.569 --> 16:20.335
- Can I tell you something?

16:20.337 --> 16:21.236
- Mm.

16:21.238 --> 16:22.504
- It was tiny.

16:22.506 --> 16:25.707
His P might as well
have been a V.

16:25.709 --> 16:28.243
- You had sex with my husband?

16:28.245 --> 16:31.146
Stevie!

16:31.148 --> 16:34.583
- One more reason not to have
done the dirty with dinky.

16:34.585 --> 16:35.484
Should we get out of here?

16:35.486 --> 16:36.652
I don't want
to make a scene.

16:36.654 --> 16:37.953
- Ah, they're not coming back.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.822
And, honey, we are the scene.

16:42.191 --> 16:44.893

into Jenna's bedroom

16:44.895 --> 16:48.130
anytime you want.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.198
- Got it.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.433
Let's go.

16:51.435 --> 16:52.334
- Not so fast.

16:52.336 --> 16:54.202
You promised me dessert.

16:54.204 --> 16:55.637
- Oh.

16:56.472 --> 16:58.173
Oh, Eva, stop.

16:58.175 --> 16:58.974
Not here.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.743
This is--
this is weird.

I'm such an idiot.

I can't stop feeling like
I'm competing with her.

17:08.352 --> 17:09.418
- You are so not.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.286
- But you know
where she hides her key,

17:11.288 --> 17:14.389
and you have, like,
all of her texts in your phone--

17:14.391 --> 17:15.891
- you saw all of our texts?

17:15.893 --> 17:17.626
- I'm sorry.
I just--

I couldn't help
but notice.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.996
And they go back a long time.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.731
- Well, they go back
to the past.

17:22.733 --> 17:26.401
And the past, well...

17:28.104 --> 17:32.040
It's now officially the past.

17:32.042 --> 17:34.609
- You erased all of them?

17:34.611 --> 17:35.510
For me?

17:35.512 --> 17:37.646
- Jenna--

17:37.648 --> 17:39.581
Jenna's deleted.

17:46.089 --> 17:47.122
- Oh, shoot.

17:47.124 --> 17:47.923

personal statement:

19:32.296 --> 19:34.763
When I started high school,
I was invisible.

It was easier that way,
not to be noticed.

19:37.601 --> 19:38.266
When I was noticed,

19:38.268 --> 19:40.769
it wasn't for the things
I wanted to be noticed for.

I'm so sorry.

- No biggie.

I never meant for things
