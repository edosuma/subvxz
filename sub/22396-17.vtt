00:06.208 --> 00:09.374
Oh, boy, minnie. We're off on
an adventure to find lost treasure!

00:09.374 --> 00:10.457
Ooh!

00:10.457 --> 00:12.249
Priceless antiquities!
Ooh!

00:12.249 --> 00:13.749
And ancient artifacts!

00:13.749 --> 00:15.208
Ooh!

00:15.208 --> 00:16.624
We'll find them all here

00:16.624 --> 00:18.541
in the valley of the kings!

00:20.291 --> 00:22.208
It's not exactly what I imagined.

00:22.541 --> 00:24.208
Oh, it's not just burning hot sands,

00:24.208 --> 00:25.083
deadly spiders and snakes.

00:27.208 --> 00:29.208
But it's also filled with
tombs and mummies!

00:29.208 --> 00:30.541
Tombs and mummies?

00:30.541 --> 00:32.166
That sounds kind of spooky.

00:32.457 --> 00:34.124
Ha! You'll see that there's
nothing to be afraid of

00:34.124 --> 00:36.707
once we find king
ought-n-not-n's lost tomb.

00:38.541 --> 00:39.707
Minnie, you found it!

00:42.291 --> 00:44.707
Oh, Mickey, watch out for booby traps.

00:45.291 --> 00:46.707
Aw, don't be silly.

00:46.707 --> 00:48.208
There's no such thing as...

00:51.541 --> 00:52.541
Oh.

00:54.333 --> 00:57.124
Lost treasures!
Antiquities!

00:57.124 --> 00:58.416
Ancient artifacts!

00:58.416 --> 01:00.083
This place is amazing!

01:00.083 --> 01:01.582
I have to find Mickey
and tell him he was right!

01:02.624 --> 01:04.291
Um, minnie, where are you?

01:04.291 --> 01:05.291
Minnie!

01:11.333 --> 01:12.333
Ha! Birdie!

01:14.416 --> 01:16.208
Minnie was right, this place is spooky!

01:16.208 --> 01:17.333
I've got to find her!

01:20.208 --> 01:21.333
Minnie.

01:36.291 --> 01:37.374
Whew!

01:37.374 --> 01:38.291
Whah!

01:42.416 --> 01:44.083
Ho-ho! Didn't touch me.

01:59.333 --> 02:02.291
Ooh! Mickey will love this.

02:02.291 --> 02:03.374
Minnie!

02:27.457 --> 02:28.541
Whew!

02:33.291 --> 02:34.291
Whee!

02:35.124 --> 02:37.208
Whoa!

02:49.333 --> 02:52.208
The lost sarcophagus of ought-n-not-n!

03:01.457 --> 03:03.291
I'm coming, minnie!

03:05.333 --> 03:06.499
Minnie!

03:07.291 --> 03:09.333
Mickey, I found you!

03:09.333 --> 03:10.333
Minnie!

03:11.374 --> 03:14.124
Mickey, you were right.
Look at all this treasure!

03:14.374 --> 03:17.208
Oh, minnie, you're
the only treasure I need.

03:19.041 --> 03:20.374
Excuse me.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.333
Can I have my wrappings back?
