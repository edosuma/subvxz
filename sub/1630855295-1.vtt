WEBVTT

02:03.471 --> 02:04.646
It's time to go.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.225
Okay, Constable.
I'll take it from here.

04:29.007 --> 04:31.271
You've been busy, James,
these last 48 hours.

04:31.314 --> 04:32.968
We've been watching you.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.839
Who are you? The police?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.276
Would you prefer
to speak with them?

04:37.494 --> 04:39.583
I'm sure Scotland Yard
will be more than willing

04:39.627 --> 04:40.889
to accommodate you.

04:42.107 --> 04:45.110
Well then,
I suppose you are stuck with us.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.329
I wanna see him.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.029
The emergency services
were too late.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.205
Ryan is no longer with us.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.035
He was too far gone
when we arrived.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.739
Please take all the time
you need,

05:06.610 --> 05:09.483
but we do need to know
everything that happened

05:09.526 --> 05:11.223
from the beginning.

05:14.401 --> 05:16.359
Well, I guess it all
goes back to two years ago.

05:30.417 --> 05:34.029
This past year
has been great, Ryan, huh?

05:35.204 --> 05:37.946
Safe to say, you've restored
my faith in teaching.

05:39.861 --> 05:42.080
You remind me
a lot of myself, really.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.517
We're the same, you and me.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.737
You like to play,
and you play to win.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.827
That's all there is, you know.

05:49.871 --> 05:52.395
That's what business is, really.
It's a game.

05:56.617 --> 05:58.836
Too bad a degree won't help me.

06:03.188 --> 06:08.411
You can't rely on yourself
more than a degree, Ryan.

06:09.151 --> 06:12.154
I mean, your grades are the best
I've seen in a long time.

06:14.678 --> 06:18.682
And you've made so much
more money, so I hear.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.513
Don't believe
everything you hear.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.611
Well, there's so much more
I would like to offer you.

06:39.268 --> 06:40.791
I would like
to make you an offer.

06:40.835 --> 06:44.578
You get your degree,
and in two years,

06:44.621 --> 06:47.015
I'd like to offer you
a special internship

06:47.058 --> 06:48.756
in one of my businesses.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.368
First, get your degree.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.110
And then, we'll see
how we get on together.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.417
What do you say?

07:02.639 --> 07:03.945
No.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.038
Last investment I made
fell through.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.259
I lost everything.

07:18.263 --> 07:20.178
Can't afford
the tuition fees anymore,

07:20.222 --> 07:22.616
so I'm no longer a student here.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.577
Goodbye, Professor.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.147
Ryan.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.106
Ryan!

08:29.465 --> 08:30.901
So, how did it go then?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.097
Oh, man.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.405
How did you lose it all
overnight?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.631
What are you gonna do now?
Are you gonna get a loan?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.775
"We regret to inform you

09:18.819 --> 09:21.473
your loan application
has been denied."

09:23.171 --> 09:25.216
Have you got any friends
that can lend you the money?

09:26.087 --> 09:28.393
You are the closest thing
I've got to a friend,

09:28.437 --> 09:29.656
and I don't even like you.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.704
Well, there's gotta be
something you can do.

09:34.748 --> 09:36.053
What about Professor Simmons?

09:36.097 --> 09:37.533
No chance.

09:39.491 --> 09:42.059
All available funding
has already been taken.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.238
No one can help me.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.459
You're late.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.679
Doesn't look like I've
missed much. Where is he?

10:36.723 --> 10:38.507
He won't be coming today.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.683
In that case, you can
tell him we'll reschedule.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.598
And next time,
please don't waste my time.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.861
You said you wanted out.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.429
-He'd like to buy it from you.
-Seriously?

10:47.472 --> 10:49.083
This isn't another one of
his stupid jokes

10:49.126 --> 10:51.215
-he likes to play, is it?
-No.

10:51.259 --> 10:54.044
You held up your end,
as you keep saying.

10:54.088 --> 10:56.525
So, he is willing to offer
a price.

10:56.568 --> 10:57.744
How much?

10:58.788 --> 11:00.964
Half the current market value.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.271
Half. Why would
I settle for half

11:03.314 --> 11:06.230
when I could get the full
amount selling it as a pub?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.450
You don't reckon
the price would be affected

11:08.493 --> 11:10.800
if people knew what this place
was used for?

11:10.844 --> 11:12.846
Don't even pretend
you'll let it slip

11:12.889 --> 11:14.848
because you'll be the ones
that end up in prison.

11:15.805 --> 11:18.155
Still playing
the innocent card, are we?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.331
You knew what this place
was to be used for,

11:20.375 --> 11:21.985
and yet you chose to ignore it.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.248
I didn't see anything.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.120
It's amazing
what people don't see

11:26.163 --> 11:28.209
-when there's money involved.
-Look, I'm not stupid.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.515
I know how much he's made here
and what he can afford.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.735
The vans that keep coming in

11:32.779 --> 11:34.389
in the early hours
of the morning?

11:34.998 --> 11:37.044
I didn't have to keep
this place closed, you know.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.219
You owe me.

11:38.262 --> 11:40.221
You're right.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.180
Without you, we wouldn't have
all what we have here today.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.445
So, you'll tell him
I want the full asking price.

11:48.098 --> 11:50.144
Otherwise, I'm selling
this place to someone else,

11:50.187 --> 11:52.537
and you guys can pack your bags.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.074
You know,
I've been thinking a lot lately

12:07.117 --> 12:11.600
about how I've changed,
especially since graduating.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.604
I thought I'd go on
to do great things, but...

12:19.347 --> 12:21.697
it's been two years
since I've seen my brother now.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.744
Well, with how I left things,

12:26.397 --> 12:28.225
I don't know what
sort of trouble he's in.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.488
I wish I could take it back.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.534
I just didn't care at the time.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.579
I wanted to live my life
to the fullest.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.018
Just wish I could say sorry.

12:38.061 --> 12:40.063
But it doesn't look like
that's gonna happen, though.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.810
Anyway, time's up. Back to work.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.290
It's good talking to you.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.256
Got to admit, I was
surprised when you text me.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.562
I thought--

14:27.605 --> 14:28.737
You thought what?

14:29.259 --> 14:30.739
I was expecting
the worst, you know?

14:33.089 --> 14:35.004
Well, you're not far wrong.

14:35.048 --> 14:36.832
Well, it's nice to know

14:36.876 --> 14:37.964
you're not laying in
the gutter somewhere, at least.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.617
Been there, done that.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.707
Ryan, come on.
Can't be that bad, surely.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.102
So, you said something about
needing my help.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.017
-What was it?
-My job.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.673
At the moment, I've been
doing it myself, but...

14:53.283 --> 14:57.026
things are... different, and...

14:58.506 --> 15:00.290
now I'm not too sure.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.338
Okay. Doing what?

15:04.381 --> 15:05.861
I can't really tell you.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.169
I'd have to show you.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.606
Whatever you need. Where is it?

15:11.649 --> 15:12.955
I don't know yet.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.002
Okay. When is it?

15:16.872 --> 15:18.439
I don't know.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.831
You don't know much
about this job, do you?

15:19.875 --> 15:21.094
Are you sure you got a job?

15:21.137 --> 15:23.313
I have to wait for a text.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.882
It's all right. I was, uh,
I'm a bit short of money lately.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.536
I was thinking maybe
I could stay at your place.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.933
I-- I could take the sofa,
if that's all right with you.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.632
-Whatever.
-Oh, yeah.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.982
And, uh, I didn't forget,

15:40.026 --> 15:41.766
I just didn't
know where to send it.

15:41.810 --> 15:44.813
I got you, uh, a birthday
present for last week.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.297
Look, I called you here
because I need help with my job.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.690
That's it.
I don't wanna know anything

15:52.734 --> 15:54.083
about your personal life.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.737
I don't wanna play
happy families.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.173
And I certainly
don't want any piece of crap

15:57.217 --> 15:58.479
you managed to afford for a day

15:58.522 --> 15:59.959
that you
weren't even around for.

16:04.311 --> 16:06.791
Why does he seem
to resent you so much?

16:07.792 --> 16:09.403
Well, a few years back,

16:09.446 --> 16:11.361
me and Ryan came into
some inheritance money.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.105
University seemed like
a good idea for the both of us.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.891
I paid for the fees up front.
But Ryan...

16:21.197 --> 16:22.851
he paid for
the fees in installments

16:22.894 --> 16:24.679
and invested his money.

16:24.722 --> 16:27.073
Seems awfully risky for someone
without any experience.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.031
Not entirely.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.902
I mean, he grew quite close
to one of the professors.

16:30.946 --> 16:37.039
They'd talk all the time,
play games, do puzzles.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.563
Ryan made a ton of money
with the professor.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.349
And so, you fell out
over Ryan's success?

16:43.306 --> 16:46.918
Not quite.
I borrowed some money from Ryan,

16:46.962 --> 16:48.616
where he had so much of it.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.575
I didn't think he'd noticed,

16:51.619 --> 16:54.361
but when his investments
fell through,

16:55.318 --> 16:59.757
he found out and he's
resented me for it ever since.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.292
So, what's there
to do in London

17:12.335 --> 17:13.728
while we wait for this text?

17:13.771 --> 17:14.990
There's a natural history
museum.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.777
Uh, pass on the skeletons
if that's all right with you,

17:19.821 --> 17:21.605
-while I'm eating my lunch.
-I don't know.

17:21.649 --> 17:24.478
I quite like looking at
the prehistoric human skulls.

17:24.521 --> 17:25.957
Hobby?

17:26.393 --> 17:28.090
Envy.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.440
Well, I wouldn't envy them
too much. They're dead.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.268
Yeah. But think
about how they died.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.053
Not hooked up to machinery

17:34.096 --> 17:35.619
with the thought of death
lingering in their mind.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.752
No, they died in
the heat of conflict.

17:38.448 --> 17:40.189
Adrenaline rushing through
their body.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.543
I'll take that over
a hospital bed any day.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.291
Yeah. Don't get too excited.

17:55.335 --> 17:58.773
I only rent the top floor,
but there is a spare room.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.560
Are you sure
you got the right place?

19:32.083 --> 19:33.824
That's the point, I suppose.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.176
It's right where no one
would think to look.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.614
But we can't go in yet.
Not until everybody's left.

19:40.657 --> 19:42.659
So, how exactly
is this earning you money?

19:42.703 --> 19:44.183
We'll find out.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.314
Look, if you're
gonna steal something--

19:45.358 --> 19:47.186
I'm not stealing anything.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.404
Unlike you, I don't
take things that aren't mine.

19:48.448 --> 19:50.232
You're still bringing that up?

19:50.276 --> 19:51.755
If I still had that money,
I could've carried on.

19:51.799 --> 19:53.235
But then you would've lost
even more.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.194
So, that makes it yours,
does it?

19:55.237 --> 19:56.412
-Is that what you're saying?
-Well, no. I'm not saying that.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.806
I wouldn't have dropped out.

20:00.677 --> 20:01.896
That money
would've kept me going

20:01.939 --> 20:03.680
for at least another six months.

20:03.724 --> 20:05.639
Look, what do you want me to do?
I've said I'm sorry.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.684
Like, how many times
can I say I'm sorry?

20:07.728 --> 20:09.860
I've spent the money.
If I had it, I'd give it to you.

20:10.339 --> 20:11.732
What do you want me to do?

20:12.298 --> 20:13.777
Well, you can
start by keeping a lookout

20:13.821 --> 20:15.083
while I go in.

20:21.176 --> 20:23.874
Ryan, it's been two years.

20:25.398 --> 20:28.792
After all this time, I'm the
only person you can call?

20:29.706 --> 20:31.317
You're still isolating yourself.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.449
You got no friends.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.059
What are you, a psychiatrist?

20:39.455 --> 20:42.371
I had hoped something
would've changed, I suppose.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.206
I'm in.

22:18.249 --> 22:19.512
-What do you see?
-Tunnels.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.252
Tunnels?

22:33.308 --> 22:36.050
I'm going further in,
but I might lose the signal.

23:06.472 --> 23:08.387
Ryan? Ryan?
There's people coming.

23:09.039 --> 23:10.998
Just do what you need to do
and get out.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.216
They're the police.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.878
Ryan, just do what
you need to do and get out.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.088
Okay, you really need

28:19.132 --> 28:21.003
to start explaining
what's going on.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.702
What was all
that about back there?

28:23.745 --> 28:25.312
You wanted to be a part of this.

28:25.355 --> 28:27.488
I'm happy to help
in any which way I can,

28:27.531 --> 28:29.316
but I need to know
what's going on first.

28:32.362 --> 28:39.195
It all started a while back
when I was homeless.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.683
I stayed in Central for a while.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.080
'Til I was moved on.

29:11.445 --> 29:13.316
I ended up stealing a car.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.796
They normally leave the keys

29:14.840 --> 29:16.537
in the old ones
ready to be broken down,

29:16.580 --> 29:18.713
so I didn't think anyone
would come looking for it.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.814
I decided to leave the car.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.776
But then,
later that evening, I was found.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.831
I'm not sure who they were.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.922
They took me to this place.
I don't know where it was.

31:34.936 --> 31:36.633
They gave me a phone.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.854
I was told to
await instructions,

31:39.898 --> 31:41.725
and I'd be paid each time
I did a job

31:41.769 --> 31:44.380
with some big payout
coming out at the end.

31:47.035 --> 31:53.172
So, at nighttime, I'd wait
for a message and head out.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.916
It did involve just
taking photos of warehouses,

31:57.959 --> 32:02.572
but more recently,
drugs and guns.

32:04.444 --> 32:07.229
-All packaged.
-So, you don't have any names?

32:07.838 --> 32:09.231
No.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.016
Do you even know
who you're working for?

32:11.059 --> 32:14.889
All I get is these texts
from a man named Mr. Black,

32:14.933 --> 32:17.848
which I'm sure is a fake name.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.807
So, you don't have any names,

32:19.850 --> 32:21.330
you don't know
who you are working for

32:21.374 --> 32:22.810
or what you're
getting yourself into?

32:23.245 --> 32:26.683
No. I don't need to know,
and I don't want to know.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.254
I'm never going back
to how it was.

32:34.561 --> 32:35.779
Never.

32:38.478 --> 32:41.263
Ryan, this is clearly
some sort of organized crime.

32:42.786 --> 32:44.832
I haven't done anything illegal.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.790
That's not gonna stop the
repercussions, though, is it?

32:46.834 --> 32:48.444
Look, if you are
not happy with this,

32:48.488 --> 32:49.880
by all means, I'll keep
your half of the money.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.623
So, decide right now.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.539
Do you want
to be a part of this?

32:57.845 --> 33:02.415
If you agree,
there's no turning back.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.461
Okay. Where to next?

33:14.296 --> 33:16.037
I don't
wanna seem ungrateful,

33:16.081 --> 33:17.908
but have you ever thought about
maybe moving away

33:17.952 --> 33:19.432
and trying something else?

33:21.129 --> 33:22.783
You think you can just move away

33:22.826 --> 33:24.219
from something like this?

33:25.351 --> 33:26.874
Well, I don't
think you've tried.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.312
And what would you have me do?

33:30.747 --> 33:32.271
Nine till five job?

33:32.314 --> 33:34.012
Three kids and a mortgage?
No, thanks.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.623
I'll take my chances here.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.192
Looks like there's police
and security inside.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.063
Yeah. They must
be raiding the place.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.066
Or making a collection.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.702
Ryan, what are you doing?

36:32.277 --> 36:33.756
There was a girl inside.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.846
All right.
So did they see you?

36:37.847 --> 36:39.284
You don't understand.

36:42.591 --> 36:43.636
She was dead.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.336
Let's just--
let's just go.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.817
-I've got the photos.
-What?

36:51.296 --> 36:52.384
You're not serious.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.520
We can't do that.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.000
Ryan, we need
to phone the police.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.567
The police were already here.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.222
If you wanna talk to them,
go ahead.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.397
We can try a different police.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.528
What good will that do?

37:07.964 --> 37:09.488
-Will it bring her back?
-Whoever done this,

37:09.531 --> 37:11.141
they need to be caught
and stopped.

37:11.185 --> 37:14.057
That's what we're doing.
We're stopping them.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.410
These photos,
someone wants them for a reason.

37:18.453 --> 37:19.933
You're crossing the line.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.151
We're not--
we're not doing this.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.980
I already agreed to do this.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.594
If I don't--
if I don't do it, I--

37:30.204 --> 37:31.597
I don't know what they'll do.

37:37.516 --> 37:39.300
All I know is
they're powerful people.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.084
So what?
They're gonna come after us?

37:41.128 --> 37:42.825
So ditch that phone,
and they'll never find us.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.653
You wanna take that risk?

37:44.697 --> 37:46.438
They found me before.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.441
They knew my name,
my situation, everything.

37:50.398 --> 37:51.878
And that was
when I was homeless.

37:55.403 --> 37:59.755
I told you before,
there's no turning back.

38:04.673 --> 38:05.848
This is my job.

38:06.806 --> 38:08.938
I earn good money,
why should I give it up?

38:08.982 --> 38:12.420
Ryan, there's plenty
of other ways to earn money.

38:12.464 --> 38:15.075
No. That's all part of the lie.

38:16.381 --> 38:17.904
That you can have
anything you want in life,

38:17.947 --> 38:19.427
all you have to do is work hard.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.650
Well, I did everything I was
supposed to do. Everything.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.392
And it all failed.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.004
They lied.

38:33.267 --> 38:34.399
They lied to us.

38:37.837 --> 38:41.928
You tell me. You did everything
as you were supposed to.

38:42.189 --> 38:43.886
What has it got you so far?

38:47.107 --> 38:48.543
You brought me into this

38:48.587 --> 38:50.328
'cause you had
no one else to call.

38:52.112 --> 38:53.505
You're lonely.

39:03.297 --> 39:04.907
I'll phone the police
when we get back.

39:08.694 --> 39:10.391
-Wait. Oh, no!
-What?

39:10.435 --> 39:11.784
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

39:11.827 --> 39:13.089
What have you forgot?

39:13.481 --> 39:15.004
My wallet.
I must have dropped it.

39:18.443 --> 39:19.792
Everything was in there.

39:21.968 --> 39:24.274
Not your ID? Oh.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.277
Yeah, everything.
My number, your number.

39:27.321 --> 39:29.105
I had it all written down.

39:29.149 --> 39:30.585
Why did you write it down?

39:30.629 --> 39:31.804
Because I don't like having

39:31.847 --> 39:32.631
that sort of stuff on my phone.

39:38.898 --> 39:41.857
Get away from me, James.
Get your own taxi back.

40:35.650 --> 40:36.782
Stop here.

41:41.150 --> 41:42.238
Hello.

41:49.594 --> 41:51.857
Who is this?

41:51.900 --> 41:53.249
Oh, come on.

41:53.685 --> 41:56.514
Surely you haven't forgotten
your old professor.

42:01.431 --> 42:02.520
Simmons.

42:07.612 --> 42:09.222
You were behind all of this?

42:09.265 --> 42:11.050
I am a man of business.

42:11.093 --> 42:13.748
Regardless of the industry,
I'm in to make money.

42:15.184 --> 42:17.143
You really do have no limits.

42:17.186 --> 42:20.973
You were one
of my best students.

42:21.016 --> 42:22.931
You could have
been part of all of this.

42:22.975 --> 42:26.021
As I said, we could
have gone far together, Ryan.

42:26.065 --> 42:29.155
But, no. No, you just left.
You took off.

42:29.198 --> 42:32.985
I lost everything, remember?
Your advice on investing.

42:33.028 --> 42:35.378
If you needed money,
then you could have come to me.

42:35.422 --> 42:36.771
I would've helped you.

42:37.206 --> 42:41.297
But, no. No, no, no.
You gave up in the world.

42:41.341 --> 42:42.864
You-- you-- It was too hard.

42:42.908 --> 42:45.258
You just decided
to take it and roll over.

42:45.301 --> 42:47.390
It was easier to have
your dreams taken away

42:47.434 --> 42:50.611
rather than to-- to actually
try risking yourself.

42:50.655 --> 42:53.266
Easier to blame somebody else,
am I right Ryan?

42:57.400 --> 42:59.838
Well, of course, you know
what I'm gonna have to do now.

43:00.882 --> 43:02.492
The same as
what you did to that girl?

43:02.536 --> 43:05.800
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you, yet.

43:06.453 --> 43:07.889
I'm gonna destroy you.

43:08.411 --> 43:12.285
But first, I think
we'll have one more little game.

43:13.416 --> 43:14.504
No, thank you.

43:15.201 --> 43:16.724
Ryan, if you end
this phone call,

43:16.768 --> 43:19.640
I swear you will regret the day

43:19.684 --> 43:22.425
you set foot
inside of my university.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.735
Goodbye, Professor.

43:48.190 --> 43:50.149
-It's Simmons.
-Simmons?

43:50.540 --> 43:52.325
-Simmons, who?
-Simmons, Simmons.

43:52.368 --> 43:54.196
As in, Professor Simmons.

43:54.240 --> 43:55.763
He's the one behind all this.

43:55.807 --> 43:57.504
The drugs, the guns,
the distribution,

43:57.547 --> 43:58.679
it all belongs to him.

43:59.288 --> 44:01.247
That sounds like
too much of a coincidence.

44:01.290 --> 44:03.292
I don't think any of
this happened by a coincidence.

44:03.336 --> 44:05.991
He killed that girl.
A bullet in the head.

44:08.036 --> 44:10.648
My guess is she got
mixed up with him somehow and

44:10.691 --> 44:12.954
that's how she ended up.

44:12.998 --> 44:14.782
-We both need to leave.
-Okay.

44:14.826 --> 44:17.089
I won't stay in the flat
in case there's any problems.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.788
There's some things I need
to do, so give me a few hours

44:20.832 --> 44:23.617
and then meet me
at Camden Lock bridge

44:23.661 --> 44:25.097
tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.

44:28.143 --> 44:30.189
Just get out of London, James.

44:33.975 --> 44:35.063
Ryan?

44:57.825 --> 44:58.913
Hello?

45:01.307 --> 45:02.482
Hello, James.

45:03.788 --> 45:05.659
You. Where's Ryan?

45:06.747 --> 45:09.141
Well, I'd like to tell you
he's unharmed.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.534
But if you're a man
in my position can hardly

45:11.578 --> 45:13.232
let something like this go.

45:13.275 --> 45:16.191
So far, we've given
him a few drops of a--

45:16.496 --> 45:18.541
a potent immobilizing drug.

45:18.846 --> 45:21.675
Probably for the best
as he won't feel what's coming.

45:22.328 --> 45:24.373
Look, you--
you don't need to do this.

45:24.417 --> 45:26.027
-Please, just--
-Ryan didn't want

45:26.071 --> 45:27.637
to play the game,

45:27.681 --> 45:29.814
so you're gonna have to fill in,
all right?

45:29.857 --> 45:31.293
Maybe save his life.

45:32.294 --> 45:34.340
You can talk to him if you like,

45:34.383 --> 45:36.298
'cause he can you can hear
everything you were saying.

45:36.342 --> 45:38.257
I mean, I would talk
to him if I-- if I were you,

45:38.300 --> 45:40.563
this might be your last chance.
I'd-- I'd make the most of this.

45:40.607 --> 45:41.913
What do you want from me?

45:42.609 --> 45:44.263
I want to give you a chance.

45:45.177 --> 45:51.400
I mean, if you win, well,
you can, um, you can save Ryan.

45:52.140 --> 45:57.363
Anyway, you better listen up,
John Wolfe Barry, 1894.

45:57.406 --> 45:58.886
That's your clue.

45:59.408 --> 46:02.237
A clue? A clue for what?
I don't understand.

46:02.281 --> 46:04.413
Jesus. Even Ryan
used to challenge me.

46:04.457 --> 46:07.286
I can see where the brain cells
went in your family.

46:07.329 --> 46:09.505
Okay. Okay. Please,
just give me a moment, okay?

46:09.549 --> 46:10.637
Just give me a moment.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.074
Ryan.

46:13.945 --> 46:18.210
Ryan, if you can muster
the strength

46:18.253 --> 46:21.300
to answer
your brother's question,

46:21.343 --> 46:23.824
then, please, be my guest.

46:23.868 --> 46:25.870
Come on.
Your life depends on it.

46:28.394 --> 46:29.612
Ryan.

46:31.266 --> 46:33.791
I've got it.
He built Blackfriars Bridge.

46:34.487 --> 46:35.749
You cheated.

46:37.272 --> 46:39.057
So, is that--

46:39.100 --> 46:40.362
Well, I see
you've got about 42 minutes

46:40.406 --> 46:41.842
before the cab arrives

46:41.886 --> 46:43.626
on the bridge
to take you to Ryan.

46:43.670 --> 46:46.978
But then if you are not
in the cab when it leaves,

46:47.500 --> 46:49.154
a bullet will
go into Ryan's head.

46:50.546 --> 46:51.721
Well, I'm in Camden.

46:52.331 --> 46:54.159
Well, then I'd a get
move on if I were you.

46:54.768 --> 46:57.249
Oh, and James, I'll be watching.

47:40.814 --> 47:41.859
I can't do it.

47:43.469 --> 47:44.513
I'm not gonna make this.

47:45.210 --> 47:46.907
I can't do it.

47:46.951 --> 47:49.257
Does it make you
feel sad, James,

47:49.301 --> 47:54.610
to see that you're such
a failure as an older brother?

47:54.654 --> 47:57.091
Does it make you
feel depressed that,

47:57.135 --> 47:58.876
despite being surrounded

47:58.919 --> 48:02.053
by thousands
and thousands of people,

48:02.096 --> 48:04.098
you've never been more alone?

48:06.796 --> 48:13.586
Listen, I am going to let you
earn an extra 30 minutes.

48:13.629 --> 48:16.110
I want you to walk
into Victoria Station,

48:16.154 --> 48:18.373
and I want you to say
at the top of your voice,

48:19.418 --> 48:22.595
"Attention, there is a bomb
in the building."

48:24.075 --> 48:25.163
You're insane.

48:25.206 --> 48:27.339
Clock's ticking, James.

48:27.382 --> 48:29.254
I'd a get a move on
if I were you.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.350
Are you sure about this, boss?

48:38.916 --> 48:40.308
It might be
even too much for us.

48:41.527 --> 48:44.008
We don't know who James and Ryan
have been talking to.

48:44.051 --> 48:45.792
We don't know who they work for.

48:46.358 --> 48:49.361
We have to discredit anything
they may have said.

48:49.839 --> 48:52.103
After that,
you can give the order.

49:04.245 --> 49:07.945
Attention! There is
a bomb in the building.

50:15.273 --> 50:16.317
He's done it.

50:17.449 --> 50:18.798
They've got
his name and picture.

50:40.472 --> 50:42.430
I'm here. I'm here. Where is he?

50:49.698 --> 50:51.091
My men can't see you.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.270
You said Blackfriars Bridge.

50:56.314 --> 50:59.230
No,
you said Blackfriars Bridge.

50:59.273 --> 51:00.579
I said you cheated.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.102
Oh, you were so close, James.

51:02.146 --> 51:03.756
You bastard.

51:03.799 --> 51:06.759
Listen,
by my watch you have--

51:06.802 --> 51:07.977
you've got about
10 minutes anyway,

51:08.021 --> 51:10.545
so perhaps another little clue.

51:10.589 --> 51:15.072
Um, it's 801 feet long
and 213 feet tall.

51:15.507 --> 51:16.856
The Tower Bridge.

51:18.162 --> 51:21.426
Ah, 9:50, James.

51:27.649 --> 51:30.261
How are you doing, Ryan?
You're still hanging in there?

51:30.304 --> 51:31.653
Drugs not wearing off?

51:33.133 --> 51:34.874
God, you must be
very disappointed

51:34.917 --> 51:37.616
at this feeble attempt
to save your life.

51:37.659 --> 51:39.270
You know, you mean
nothing to your brother.

51:39.313 --> 51:40.880
He's not even trying.

51:40.923 --> 51:44.318
I was more family to you
than he ever was.

51:44.362 --> 51:46.407
Ah, he must disappoint you.

51:49.976 --> 51:51.891
But then,
you burnt down my stores.

51:52.457 --> 51:53.632
Hmm.

51:54.937 --> 51:57.157
Did you think
I would let that go?

51:58.593 --> 52:02.119
I own this city.

52:02.162 --> 52:04.469
I own this city.

52:04.512 --> 52:07.733
I mean the public, they just
go about their everyday lives.

52:07.776 --> 52:09.648
They haven't got a clue
what's going on.

52:10.866 --> 52:12.781
They don't really understand.

52:12.825 --> 52:16.742
They're totally unaware
of what's really happening.

52:17.569 --> 52:19.658
Unaware that I am king.

52:28.014 --> 52:29.842
Five.

52:29.885 --> 52:31.974
Ryan, Ryan, if you
can hear me, don't worry.

52:32.018 --> 52:33.541
-Four.
-I'm coming, mate.

52:33.585 --> 52:35.326
-I'm almost there.
-Three.

52:35.369 --> 52:37.676
-I'm almost there.
-Two.

52:39.852 --> 52:42.159
-I'm almost--
-One.

52:42.202 --> 52:44.596
Goodbye, James.

53:19.413 --> 53:21.328
All right. Calm down, sir.

53:21.633 --> 53:23.504
Right. Just take a moment.

53:23.548 --> 53:25.941
Take your breath and, uh,
would you care to sit down?

53:25.985 --> 53:27.508
Sit down?
I haven't got time for that.

53:27.552 --> 53:29.293
We need to get him now.

53:29.336 --> 53:32.034
All right. Okay. Let me just
take a few details.

53:32.078 --> 53:36.213
Uh, right. So what's your name
and your brother's name?

53:36.256 --> 53:38.824
-I'm James.
-James.

53:38.867 --> 53:39.955
My brother's name is Ryan.

53:40.478 --> 53:43.829
Ryan. Okay. Ryan.

53:44.177 --> 53:46.919
And, uh, where do you think
he might be now?

53:46.962 --> 53:48.529
I spoke to him 30 minutes ago.

53:48.573 --> 53:49.791
Can-- can you trace my phone?

53:51.184 --> 53:54.100
All right. When and where
did you last see him?

53:54.405 --> 53:58.278
-Soho Square.
-Soho. Okay. And, uh,

53:58.322 --> 54:01.455
who do you think
might have done this and, uh,

54:01.499 --> 54:03.457
where do you think
we might find them?

54:03.501 --> 54:05.546
A professor from the university.
His name is Professor Simmons.

54:05.894 --> 54:09.420
Professor Simmons. Okay.

54:09.811 --> 54:13.554
Just you wait right there, sir.
I need to radio this through.

56:31.910 --> 56:33.564
-Ryan.
-Yeah, I'm okay.

56:35.043 --> 56:39.570
Simmons, he's-- he's turned all
of disused underground London

56:39.613 --> 56:42.224
-into some kind of network.
-A network?

56:42.268 --> 56:43.835
Yeah. Transportation.

56:43.878 --> 56:48.013
Any disused tunnel,
service track, railway,

56:48.056 --> 56:49.928
he's turned them all
into some sort

56:49.971 --> 56:52.931
of distribution network,
all connected.

56:53.888 --> 56:57.326
With The King's Head pub
right at the center.

56:58.893 --> 57:02.549
Ryan, you have to know I tried.

57:02.593 --> 57:05.073
I really,
really tried finding you.

57:06.510 --> 57:07.641
Yeah.

57:09.121 --> 57:10.209
I know.

57:15.823 --> 57:17.346
Who would've thought
two years ago

57:17.390 --> 57:18.696
that this is how it would go?

57:22.874 --> 57:26.225
I did my best, but it never
seems to be bloody good enough.

57:26.921 --> 57:28.009
Are you safe?

57:29.446 --> 57:33.319
If I can find my way
out of this place then... maybe.

57:34.799 --> 57:36.888
Come and meet me
before you do anything.

57:36.931 --> 57:39.325
There's police outside looking
for me and probably you too.

57:41.109 --> 57:42.459
I'll call you when I'm ready.

57:44.156 --> 57:47.289
Ready? Why? What'd you need?

57:48.552 --> 57:49.770
The king's head.

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:11.015
Nick,

01:01:11.058 --> 01:01:12.886
the boss needs you
in right away.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.714
I'll make a move now.
Where is he?

01:01:14.758 --> 01:01:16.673
Looks like
he's heading towards Soho.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.650
We don't know where
he's going yet, Nick.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:39.086
The units have lost him.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.348
He's heading back to
Soho Square.

01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:43.612
Be ready for me
and keep the public away.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:54.771
Well, you're
remarkably resilient.

01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:59.166
So what's this, huh? A truce?

01:03:01.995 --> 01:03:03.649
You take one more step

01:03:03.692 --> 01:03:04.911
and I'll have
your fucking head blown off.

01:03:11.352 --> 01:03:12.919
That girl...

01:03:14.747 --> 01:03:16.227
I found her body.

01:03:19.317 --> 01:03:20.927
Why did she have to die?

01:03:22.668 --> 01:03:24.278
What could
she possibly have done?

01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.674
It's just business, Ryan.
It's a game and she lost.

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:31.242
I don't force anyone
to take part in this.

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.113
People choose
to do it themselves.

01:03:33.157 --> 01:03:34.985
And-- and-- and then
they blame someone else

01:03:35.028 --> 01:03:36.464
when they don't
get their own way.

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.945
I don't remember signing up
for any of this.

01:03:38.989 --> 01:03:41.121
Oh, you-- you did

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:43.907
when you burnt down my stores.
Who paid you?

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:45.604
Why would I tell you anything?

01:03:45.647 --> 01:03:47.562
You don't have to.
In fact, I think

01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.390
it's about time we ended this,
don't you?

01:03:49.782 --> 01:03:51.392
After all, I think we both know

01:03:51.436 --> 01:03:53.438
only one of us is gonna
walk out of here alive.

01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:56.093
So what do you say, Ryan?

01:03:56.136 --> 01:03:57.485
One last game?

01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:01.359
One bullet, six chambers?

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:03.665
Or I could just take you down
to the station right now.

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:08.235
You think you've beaten me.

01:04:08.801 --> 01:04:09.889
Well, you haven't.

01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:13.806
I have the best.
The justice system works for me.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.417
And I own this city, kid.

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:21.814
Now, if you lock me up today,
I will be out next week

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.729
and you better look
over your shoulder

01:04:23.772 --> 01:04:26.166
because I'll be coming for you
and your brother.

01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:31.911
Unless, of course,
we settle this now.

01:04:54.499 --> 01:04:55.674
It's time to go.

01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:06.946
Where is he now?

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:08.426
He was seen running past
Soho Square.

01:05:08.469 --> 01:05:10.689
Shit! He's not going
to Ryan's place,

01:05:10.732 --> 01:05:12.430
he's going
to The King's Head pub.

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:14.301
Tell the boss to get out now.

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:33.059
I've got eyes on him.
It's now or never.

01:05:33.842 --> 01:05:35.801
What's the boss say?

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:37.846
We can't get a hold
of the boss right now.

01:05:43.287 --> 01:05:45.637
Under no circumstances
can James be arrested.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.986
Gotta be taken out
before he can talk.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:48.727
I know the route he's taking.

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:50.381
Meet me at Ramillies Place.

01:06:15.797 --> 01:06:17.756
We're holding the public back.

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:19.366
You got five minutes before the
other units start turning up.

01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.934
You know the blind spots,
don't miss.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:27.157
-That's not gonna work.
-Ryan, what happened to you?

01:06:27.505 --> 01:06:29.942
The Ryan I knew was like me.

01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:34.425
You know, I-- I blame
those nine to five simpletons.

01:06:34.468 --> 01:06:36.035
You know,
they try and drag us down.

01:06:36.079 --> 01:06:38.211
Am I right, Ryan? No?

01:06:38.907 --> 01:06:39.996
Shut up.

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:44.391
But tell me,
could you live with this?

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:50.223
Wondering if
you could have been with me?

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.269
Hmm?

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:55.141
Do you remember
what I always told you?

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:57.883
Do you remember?

01:06:59.276 --> 01:07:00.712
We're the same.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:06.935
We have to play
and we have to win.

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:10.635
What do you say?

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:13.942
Shall we find out
who's the better man?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.146
Got ya.

01:08:55.218 --> 01:09:00.353
One bullet, six chambers.

01:09:02.703 --> 01:09:04.009
One bullet.

01:09:08.753 --> 01:09:10.407
Six chambers.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.459
Oh no, you first.

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.854
I'll take
whatever bullet you don't.

01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:01.371
One.

01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:09.596
Two.

01:10:15.602 --> 01:10:17.256
Three.

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:25.090
Four.

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:32.315
Five.

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:57.340
Ah, you shot me,
you little prick!

01:10:58.776 --> 01:11:01.953
Oh, why didn't you just kill me?

01:11:02.388 --> 01:11:03.998
Goodbye, Professor.

01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:16.359
Ryan, I didn't teach you this.

01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.086
And that's all you know, is it?

01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:51.307
Were you expecting more?

01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:54.745
Should you divulge
any of the information

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:56.790
I'm about to share with you;

01:11:56.834 --> 01:12:00.446
you'll be swiftly taken to the
UK's maximum security prison.

01:12:01.752 --> 01:12:06.844
Now, Professor Simmons
is the remnant of a dying breed.

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:08.933
People like this we know about.

01:12:09.499 --> 01:12:12.328
But due to
his extensive criminal network,

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:16.288
we've experienced difficulty
dealing with him.

01:12:16.549 --> 01:12:19.291
He has judges, police officers,

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.337
even secret servicemen
under his control.

01:12:23.164 --> 01:12:26.429
Any attempt
to bring him down failed

01:12:26.472 --> 01:12:29.736
until he became involved
with a young woman,

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.304
a woman,
unknown to the professor,

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:35.394
the daughter of someone
of great importance.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:37.353
-So why didn't you do anything?
-We did.

01:12:38.049 --> 01:12:43.402
But we needed to know exactly
what we were dealing with

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:47.232
in order to avoid
the legal ramifications

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:49.060
of an official inquiry,
which would've given

01:12:49.103 --> 01:12:51.628
the professor
a distinct advantage.

01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:53.673
You paid Ryan.
You sent him the phone.

01:12:54.457 --> 01:12:58.112
We needed to find someone close
to him and Ryan was selected.

01:12:59.592 --> 01:13:02.508
Of course,
Ryan was unaware of any of this.

01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:06.773
But we did agree to pay over
a sum of money on completion,

01:13:06.817 --> 01:13:10.560
which I have no issues
on passing onto you.

01:13:20.091 --> 01:13:21.571
Very convenient for you,
wasn't it?

01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:27.664
That Ryan's investment
just suddenly fell through

01:13:27.707 --> 01:13:29.013
right when he needed the money.

01:13:30.231 --> 01:13:33.104
If it hadn't,
he might still be alive.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:37.238
As I told you before, James,
we were too late for Ryan.
