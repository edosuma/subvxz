WEBVTT

02:12.366 --> 02:13.832
Come in.

02:17.737 --> 02:21.173
 Hi. I'm Dr. Spencer.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.407
 But you can just
call me Marcella.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.878
 Zoe Reynard.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.514
 I got your name
through a friend

02:28.516 --> 02:32.251
and she says you're discreet.

02:32.253 --> 02:34.786
 Absolutely. It comes
with the territory.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.422
 Make yourself
comfortable, okay?

02:37.424 --> 02:40.592
 Take off your coat.
Sit wherever you like.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.867
 I'm glad you found the
time to come and see me.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.702
 I assure you

02:50.704 --> 02:54.907
 that everything we talk about
is completely confidential.

02:54.909 --> 02:58.510
 No one sees these notes but me.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.280
 Well, it's not like I'm a
movie star, or anything.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.282
 Why don't we just
try something?

03:03.284 --> 03:06.185
 Maybe you can tell me
what brought you here.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.554
 You know, would that
be easier for you?

03:08.556 --> 03:10.923
 Um, okay.

03:10.925 --> 03:15.894
 Well, it started the moment
that, um, I realized that

03:15.896 --> 03:17.629
 all the good things in my life

03:17.631 --> 03:20.899
 could never fill this void
that's always been there.

03:22.902 --> 03:25.504
 <i> I have the perfect life.</i>

03:25.506 --> 03:26.939
 <i> Wonderful home.</i>

03:29.209 --> 03:31.476
 <i> Best family anyone
could hope for.</i>

03:31.478 --> 03:34.313
Show it to Granny.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.448
<i> My kids are the
light</i> <i> of my life.</i>

03:36.450 --> 03:37.516
 <i> They're funny...</i> <i> Go!</i>

03:37.518 --> 03:39.985
 <i> ...and bright</i>

03:39.987 --> 03:41.820
<i> and just delicious, you know.</i>

03:41.822 --> 03:44.656
 A soldier holding a
baby kangaroo... What?

03:44.658 --> 03:46.391
 No! You're, like... Okay.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.260
 Hold this thought. What else?
Gimme something else.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.795
Up high. It's a torch!

03:49.797 --> 03:52.598
It's a... Uh, Statue of Liberty!

03:52.600 --> 03:54.366
Yay!

03:54.368 --> 03:55.867
 Oh, my God! How
did he get that?

03:55.869 --> 03:57.669
 Whoo-hoo! Okay, now you.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.571
<i> My momma's the kind of woman</i>

03:59.573 --> 04:01.907
 <i> whose hug could turn
a dark day bright.</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:06.845
 <i> My husband Jason is
every woman's dream.</i>

04:06.847 --> 04:08.547
 <i> He's my first love
and my soul mate.</i>

04:33.773 --> 04:35.774
Oh, yeah. Yeah!

04:55.328 --> 04:57.629
It was so good, baby.

04:57.631 --> 04:58.864
 You wanna go for Round 3?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.999
Mmm.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.734
 Mmm.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.604
 Mmm. Wanna do
something special.

05:06.673 --> 05:09.308
 Do you? Mmm. Yeah.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.510
 That feels so good. I love you.

05:14.447 --> 05:15.647
 Really?

05:22.755 --> 05:24.656
Mmm-hmm.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.581
Good morning, Zoe.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.715
 Would you like a
tracking number,

06:23.717 --> 06:24.649
 so you can give them a call?

06:24.651 --> 06:25.784
 Good morning, boss.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.119
 Good morning, Shane.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.154
 You look absolutely
dazzling, as usual.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.522
 Thank you.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.030
 Can you tell Brina
to come see me

06:39.032 --> 06:41.032
 when she gets in? Mmm-hmm.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.567
 Brina is here.

06:42.569 --> 06:45.570
 Brina is always here.
Brina lives here.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.873
 Hmm. Maybe I should
charge you for rent.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.674
 Maybe you should
start paying me more.

06:49.676 --> 06:50.909
 Maybe I should.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.877
 Maybe you can't afford it.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.044
 Maybe I'll do it anyhow.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.446
 Maybe I won't let you.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.814
 Hey! I'm the boss.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.083
 And I'm here to keep
you being the boss.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.918
 You try to pay me
more, and I'll quit.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.653
Okay, I'm confused.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.688
 All right. Down to business.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.725
Quinton Canosa...
Quinton Canosa exhibit.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.127
 I need... A catalog of his art.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.896
 And also... His bio,

07:10.898 --> 07:12.731
 references, history...

07:12.733 --> 07:14.833
 And finally... Nope,
can't get that.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.568
 What? His photo.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.737
 He doesn't let people
take his photo.

07:18.739 --> 07:22.040
 I was gonna say "croissant,"
but thanks for the info.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.809
 So, wait, this guy still
doesn't have a rep?

07:23.811 --> 07:25.677
 Amazing. I know.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.112
 Well, he's all about the art.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.850
 "Quinton Canosa, the
people's artist."

07:31.852 --> 07:33.118
 Mmm-hmm.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.519
He's amazing.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.054
 Yeah.

07:36.056 --> 07:39.925
 You know, every piece
just grabs you,

07:39.927 --> 07:41.026
 you know, in the gut.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.029
 We could license his work

07:44.031 --> 07:47.199
 and introduce him to a
whole new world of revenue.

07:47.201 --> 07:49.701
 Okay. "Revenue" is a good word.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.704
 Do your thing, girl.
Go get that revenue.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.107
 Ooh! And once that happens,

07:56.109 --> 07:58.543
 we need to reinstate
mani-pedi Fridays.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.592
Uh, excuse me.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.564
 Do you like it?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.799
 Like it? I... I love it. Yeah.

09:27.801 --> 09:30.135
 Quinton Canosa's an
incredible talent.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.871
 Huh. If you say so.

09:35.675 --> 09:38.043
 Do you know anything about art?

09:38.045 --> 09:39.878
 That what you call it?

09:39.880 --> 09:41.079
 Okay, uh...

09:41.081 --> 09:43.014
 Quinton Canosa's genius, okay?

09:43.016 --> 09:45.917
 He's one of the greatest
artists of our time.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.753
 If you can't see that, I don't
know what you're doing here.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.025
 Nice work, Quinton.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.327
 Really nice.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.728
 Appreciate it.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.330
 Lovely lady as well.

09:59.866 --> 10:03.301
No, no, no... You? You...

10:03.303 --> 10:05.670
You're Quinton Canosa?

10:05.672 --> 10:07.906
 I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.241
Okay. Yeah, you got me.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.943
 I feel like such a fool.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.980
 No, no. Please don't.
Well, just a little bit.

10:14.982 --> 10:16.281
 I'm so embarrassed.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.282
 I'm just kidding.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.756
Oh, I don't speak Spanish.

10:24.758 --> 10:28.927
 Oh, you don't? Um, I
was saying, it, uh...

10:28.929 --> 10:30.195
 It's a pleasure to meet you.

10:32.932 --> 10:36.034
 It's an honor to
meet you, Quinton.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.936
 Yeah. I didn't catch
your name, Ms...

10:37.938 --> 10:39.938
 Oh. It's Mrs. Zoe Reynard.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.106
 Oh.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.274
 Oh, Mrs.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.343
 Yeah. I see.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.178
 God, that always
happens, right?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.647
 The good ones,
they're always taken.

10:48.649 --> 10:52.317
Oh... Oh, thank you.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.189
Uh... I think he's my favorite.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.660
 Really?

11:10.002 --> 11:11.002
 That's mine.

11:14.840 --> 11:19.010
 Uh, I don't know if this
is the right place or time

11:19.012 --> 11:22.213
 to talk business?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.282
 Well, if it's the only way
to keep you next to me...

11:27.253 --> 11:32.023
Um... Oh, well, uh...
Um, business?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.125
What?

11:34.127 --> 11:35.694
 You were gonna talk
about business.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.163
 Oh, yeah, yeah. Well,
I have a company

11:38.165 --> 11:40.832
 and, uh, we represent
contemporary artists.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.367
 Oh, wow. That's nice. Yeah.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.335
 Okay, can you tell me about it?

11:44.337 --> 11:46.171
 Oh. Yeah, okay, uh...

11:46.173 --> 11:48.373
 We would license your work
to the highest bidder,

11:48.375 --> 11:52.377
 you know, it could be a
classy advertising campaign,

11:52.379 --> 11:57.148
 or, um, you know, inspiration
for a clothing line.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.718
 I mean, you are an
incredible artist, solely,

11:59.720 --> 12:02.854
 but we would expand on
that artistry into a brand.

12:02.856 --> 12:04.723
 That's nice.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.891
 Can you explain that
to me again, please?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.828
 Oh, I'm sorry. Spanish...
Am I talking too fast?

12:11.164 --> 12:13.098
 I just love to watch
the way your lips move.

12:16.368 --> 12:20.371
 Um, so, you know, if
you're interested,

12:20.373 --> 12:24.242
 uh, my office could contact
you and set up a meeting.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.811
 Okay, um... I don't think...
Uh, you know what?

12:26.813 --> 12:29.380
 Honestly, I don't
like to be so formal.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.216
 Besides, you already
know I'm interested.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.951
 So let's do something.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.220
 Monday morning. 9:00.
Come to my studio.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.389
 Oh! Great.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.459
 Pleasure to meet you...

12:43.796 --> 12:45.930
 Zoe. Oh, can I call you "Zoe"?

12:47.266 --> 12:48.800
Call me Zoe. Okay.

12:52.404 --> 12:55.306
 <i> Meeting Quinton Canosa
just made me realize</i>

12:55.308 --> 12:59.144
 how much I missed
excitement in my life.

12:59.146 --> 13:01.412
 And did you act out
on that feeling?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.482
 I sure did.

13:18.397 --> 13:20.365
 <i> I tried to relive
it with Jason.</i>

13:25.437 --> 13:26.971
<i> And?</i>

13:28.374 --> 13:30.108
<i> And nothing.</i>

13:33.213 --> 13:34.445
<i> Hello?</i>

13:34.447 --> 13:37.315
 Hey, handsome. Are
you on your way?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.184
 Oh, sweetie.

13:39.186 --> 13:42.153
 This is gonna be one
of those long nights.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.455
 <i> I gotta finish the plans</i> <i> for
the civic center</i> <i> by the weekend</i>

13:44.457 --> 13:47.058
 <i> and I'm way behind.</i>

13:47.060 --> 13:48.827
 We didn't have any
plans tonight, did we?

13:51.230 --> 13:52.530
 Guess not.

13:56.235 --> 13:58.436
 <i> Um, hurry home, okay?</i>

13:58.438 --> 13:59.437
 I'll try my best.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.841
 <i> But don't wait up,</i> <i> all right?</i>

14:02.843 --> 14:04.409
 <i> And kiss the kids for me.</i>

14:04.411 --> 14:07.312
 Okay. I will. Love you.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.614
 Our love is forever.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.318
 Always has been.

14:13.320 --> 14:17.055
Always will be.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.623
 <i> All right. Sweet dreams.</i>

14:38.244 --> 14:40.245
 Oh, hi, Momma.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.948
 Um, I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?

14:43.950 --> 14:45.862
 Hmm. You are definitely
going to be the

14:45.874 --> 14:47.986
best-dressed lady in the
produce department.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.889
Well, I got dressed
up for Jason.

14:50.891 --> 14:52.423
 I'll see you in a minute.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.455
 Thank you.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.063
Mmm.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.464
 Excuse me.

15:35.334 --> 15:36.434
 Hello?

15:37.636 --> 15:39.637
 Oh. Hi, Mom.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.406
<i> Hey, you still at the store?</i>

15:41.408 --> 15:44.275
 Um, I'm in the parking lot.
I'm just leaving.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.978
 Can I get you something?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.947
 <i> Oh, I don't want you
to have to go back in.</i>

15:48.949 --> 15:51.649
 You're probably ready
to hop into bed.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.687
 Is that music I hear
in the parking lot?

15:55.689 --> 15:59.157
 Oh, someone's just blasting
their stereo. Um...

15:59.159 --> 16:00.491
<i> What is it?</i>

16:00.493 --> 16:02.126
 <i> I don't mind.
I'm already here.</i>

16:02.128 --> 16:04.562
 I could sure use some ice cream.
I mean, uh...

16:04.564 --> 16:07.098
 That cookie dough
flavor, if they have it.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.400
 Cookie dough ice
cream, coming right up.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.535
 <i> You sure?</i>

16:10.537 --> 16:12.370
 Yes, I'm sure, Mom.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.105
 I'll be right there.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.187
 Holy shit.

16:54.446 --> 16:56.414
 Mmm. Oh!

16:56.416 --> 16:57.615
 Oh, hi.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.019
 Just got home. Mmm.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.356
 I couldn't wait to
make it up to you

17:06.458 --> 17:08.559
 for missing dinner.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.494
I'm sorry.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.597
 Mmm.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.465
 Well, I forgive you.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.203
 I love you. I love you, too.

18:13.158 --> 18:15.726
You look so beautiful
when you sleep.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.278
Mommy!

18:34.280 --> 18:36.347
 Wake up, sleepyhead!

18:36.349 --> 18:38.349
Oh...

18:38.351 --> 18:41.452
 Lucky me. My own
personal wake-up call.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.287
 You must be hungry.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.455
 Come on. Let me make
you some breakfast.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.290
 Dad's already made breakfast.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.558
 He did?

18:47.560 --> 18:49.260
 He made breakfast? Yeah.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.829
 Well, let me go see.
I'm so excited.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.798
Good morning! Good morning!

19:04.276 --> 19:05.910
 Hey, sleepyhead!

19:05.912 --> 19:07.612
 Hi! Good morning!

19:07.614 --> 19:09.447
 Good morning.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.548
 Here we go.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.784
 For my beautiful wife.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.187
 There you go. It's hot. Oh.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.688
 Oh! It is hot. Um...

19:17.690 --> 19:19.390
 Well, I have to
get the kids to...

19:19.392 --> 19:21.325
 I'll take 'em today. You
just enjoy your breakfast.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.560
Don't forget this.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.895
 Thank you.

19:23.897 --> 19:25.663
 Good morning, Mom.
You got up late.

19:25.665 --> 19:28.266
Mmm. Good morning, big boy.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.634
Okay, guys. Ready for school?

19:29.636 --> 19:30.768
 Nope.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.270
 Ha-ha! Very funny. Let's go.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.671
 Where's your backpack?
We love school!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.873
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.508
 Have a good day. I love you.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.377
 Our love is forever.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.513
 Always has been.
Always will be.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.549
<i> I was watching the
love of my life</i>

19:44.551 --> 19:46.551
 <i> take our beautiful
children to school</i>

19:46.553 --> 19:49.487
 <i> and all I could think about
was what I was still missing.</i>

19:50.522 --> 19:51.622
 <i> It's so strange, you know,</i>

19:51.624 --> 19:52.957
 to love someone so much,

19:52.959 --> 19:54.959
 and still have it
never be enough.

19:56.228 --> 19:58.196
 Uh, physically.

19:58.198 --> 20:00.331
 So did you feel this way
in other relationships

20:00.333 --> 20:01.732
 before you got married?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.202
 Well, I wouldn't know.
I never had any.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.836
 Jason is the first person

20:05.838 --> 20:07.972
 you'd ever been with,
until recently?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.674
 Yes.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.943
 We were high
school sweethearts.

20:11.945 --> 20:14.679
 We had our first child
a few years later.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.514
 And the rest is history.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.383
 Do you feel that changed
your relationship with Jason?

20:19.385 --> 20:20.952
 Yes.

20:20.954 --> 20:22.553
 It made us parents.

20:24.224 --> 20:26.724
 It's just that I, you know,

20:26.726 --> 20:30.728
 always needed something
more in my life.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.598
 Well, you know, Zoe, with
kids, intimacy changes.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.435
 Sometimes you gotta
make time for it.

20:37.437 --> 20:39.537
 Yeah.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.572
 Not really.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.342
 Look, we have sex two or
three times a day sometimes.

20:45.644 --> 20:49.347
 And I'm still not satisfied.

20:49.349 --> 20:50.982
 And if I keep telling
him that I want more,

20:50.984 --> 20:52.783
 he's gonna think I'm
a complete freak.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.752
 From everything you say, it
sounds like you and Jason

20:54.754 --> 20:56.420
 have a very strong
relationship.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.391
 I should've talked to him more.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.830
 I should've done a lot of
things, but, instead...

21:09.401 --> 21:10.701
 Instead, you what?

21:13.905 --> 21:17.575
 I took my first step
down a terrible path.

21:42.868 --> 21:43.901
 Hello?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.073
 Hello?

21:51.043 --> 21:51.909
 Hello?

22:05.023 --> 22:05.956
 Zoe?

22:12.764 --> 22:14.732
 Did I scare you?

22:14.734 --> 22:16.667
 So you live here, too, huh?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.636
 Oh, yeah.

22:18.638 --> 22:19.837
 I actually do everything here.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.642
 Some coffee?

22:24.644 --> 22:25.910
 No, thanks.

22:29.548 --> 22:30.948
 Tequila shot?

22:30.950 --> 22:33.584
No. No tequila.

22:38.590 --> 22:42.093
 Uh, my husband would
love your work.

22:42.095 --> 22:43.961
 Really? Yeah, he
has a good eye.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.696
 He's an architect.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.001
 Well, he's obviously
a man of taste.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.837
Obviously.

22:54.506 --> 22:55.506
 <i> Por favor.</i>

23:05.550 --> 23:06.917
 Okay. So down to business.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.386
 Yes.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.888
 Here's what we do
at Zoe & Company.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.657
 Oh, let me guess. You add
me to your client roster,

23:13.659 --> 23:17.128
 and then you license my
work to the highest bidder,

23:17.130 --> 23:20.097
 and then my stuff ends
up on every calendar,

23:20.099 --> 23:22.500
 every coffee mug, lunch box...

23:22.502 --> 23:25.069
 I don't know. Just
pretty much everywhere.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.871
- You think I'm that crass?
-       Wow.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.175
 Okay, maybe coffee mugs.

23:38.984 --> 23:42.186
 So I believe you have a
contract for me to review?

23:42.188 --> 23:43.521
 Uh, yeah.

23:44.556 --> 23:45.623
 Yeah.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.796
 You can go over that
with your attorney

23:51.798 --> 23:53.497
 and do all your research
about us, or whatever...

23:53.499 --> 23:55.599
 Oh, don't worry. I, uh...

23:55.601 --> 23:58.569
 I have done all the
research I need.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.504
 Yeah.

24:00.506 --> 24:05.142
Uh... That's it? That's it.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.645
 Signed, sealed, delivered.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.714
 The one and only Quinton
Canosa is my new client?

24:10.716 --> 24:12.116
 Okay.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.857
 I'm all yours.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.494
 I better go.

24:23.496 --> 24:24.662
 Zoe...

24:26.598 --> 24:28.566
 You, uh... You're not the
first person to ask me

24:28.568 --> 24:31.902
 to do the whole
commercial art thing.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.704
 I've turned down
everyone before.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.139
 Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah.

24:35.141 --> 24:36.140
 You wanna know why I chose you?

24:37.175 --> 24:39.109
 Why?

24:39.111 --> 24:40.978
 I wanna ask you for
something in return.

24:43.915 --> 24:45.115
 I want to paint you.

24:46.751 --> 24:50.054
Well, I'm flattered, but, uh...

24:50.056 --> 24:52.256
 Let me think about that one.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.226
 Okay, so, I will let my
office formalize our deal

24:55.228 --> 24:57.027
 and get back to you.

24:58.663 --> 25:00.898
 I want to paint you and
put you over my bed.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.737
 So that when you're not here,

25:06.739 --> 25:09.173
 I can satisfy myself with
the mere thought of you.

25:11.109 --> 25:13.544
 Uh, I'm flattered, but...

25:14.946 --> 25:18.182
 I really am. But I can't.
I'm married.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.251
 So... How do you
open this damn door?

25:22.954 --> 25:25.756
 Relax. I know you want it.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.125
 I can feel it. I
know you want it.

26:55.714 --> 26:58.649
I can't... This isn't right.

27:00.218 --> 27:02.720
 It's not right. Come on, Zoe.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.221
 Nothing's ever felt so right.

27:20.639 --> 27:22.172
 Oh, yeah.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.674
 Oh, God, yes!

28:17.462 --> 28:18.462
 Boss?

28:20.932 --> 28:22.800
 Excuse me? I was buzzing you.

28:22.802 --> 28:25.035
 There's a guy named
Balthazar Crayne on 2.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.708
Um... Take a message. You sure?

28:30.710 --> 28:32.976
 This guy doesn't sound like
he's used to being kept waiting.

28:32.978 --> 28:34.812
 Take a message.

28:35.847 --> 28:37.147
 Got it.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.015
Excuse me, boss.

29:12.017 --> 29:13.417
 Excuse me.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.985
 Oh, I have this. Boss?

29:14.987 --> 29:17.521
 Can you hang on a sec?
I'll be right back.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.526
 Alfred Conteh is freaking
over the coffee mugs.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.161
 Yeah, I can't deal
with him right now.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.196
 You all right? I'm
not feeling well.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.265
 So I'll be home and just, um,

29:28.267 --> 29:29.933
 forward me anything
that's urgent.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.102
 Is Balthazar Crayne urgent?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.371
 His office just
called a third time.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.340
 Oh. Well, what's the problem?

29:36.342 --> 29:38.008
 Balthazar Crayne!

29:38.010 --> 29:40.177
 This Balthazar Crayne!

29:40.179 --> 29:41.779
 He could change our lives.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.847
 Take this place
to the next level.

29:43.849 --> 29:45.182
 He saw our website.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.251
 Well, how do you know this guy?

29:47.253 --> 29:49.186
 Well, his No. 2 man's assistant

29:49.188 --> 29:51.522
 is my sister's best
friend from high school.

29:51.524 --> 29:54.057
 She introduced me to a guy
who works for his accountant.

29:54.059 --> 29:56.393
 One drink led to another,
I sent him our website,

29:56.395 --> 29:59.797
 and now the Balthazar
Crayne is calling you.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.100
 Nice work.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.502
 No. "Nice work" is
when I introduce you

30:05.504 --> 30:08.272
 to an up-and-coming artist.

30:08.274 --> 30:12.075
 This is "Brina, you are the most freaking
amazing person in the world" level work.

30:12.077 --> 30:14.211
 So you go back in your
office and you call him.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.446
I'll be home, okay?

30:16.448 --> 30:19.316
 Just tell him that I'll take
him to dinner tomorrow night.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.118
 And, um, we'll discuss it then.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.387
 And just make it
someplace expensive.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.956
 I pull this off and you
owe me something big.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.224
 Bentley big!

30:27.226 --> 30:28.926
 Just please handle it.

31:27.085 --> 31:28.552
Mom?

31:31.122 --> 31:32.956
 Mom? You're home?

31:32.958 --> 31:35.025
 Hi, sweetie.

31:35.027 --> 31:37.561
 I thought you couldn't come to the
game because you were working?

31:37.563 --> 31:39.596
 We saw your car in the driveway.
You okay?

31:39.598 --> 31:41.899
 Uh, bad headache.

31:41.901 --> 31:44.067
 Look, I wasn't feeling
well, sweetie.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.236
 So I came home early, okay?

31:46.238 --> 31:48.505
 But I promise I will be
there at the next one.

31:48.507 --> 31:50.474
 Okay, sweetie? I promise.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.010
 Okay. You have to come.

31:53.012 --> 31:54.645
 It's the last game
of the season.

31:54.647 --> 31:56.546
 You have my word. Got it?

31:58.349 --> 32:00.417
 Uh, why don't you let
Grandma go get you a snack

32:00.419 --> 32:01.618
 and go finish your homework?

32:01.620 --> 32:02.653
 Okay.

32:07.158 --> 32:08.325
 Are you sure you're okay?

32:08.327 --> 32:10.193
 Uh, yeah.

32:10.195 --> 32:13.096
 You know, maybe it was the
kids' flu from last week.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.998
 I don't know. I just
took some medicine.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.034
 Okay. I'll be down
there in a sec.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.202
 No, no, no. Rest. I'll get
him started on homework

32:19.204 --> 32:21.238
 and get Kayla from piano.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.706
 Okay. Thanks, Mom.

32:24.642 --> 32:26.009
 Love you.

32:26.011 --> 32:26.944
 Love you, too. Okay.

33:14.158 --> 33:17.427
 Here is the restaurant
address and directions.

33:17.429 --> 33:21.431
 Balthazar will meet you
there tonight at 7:00 sharp.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.101
 I had to sell one of my kidneys to
get a reservation, so don't be late.

33:27.038 --> 33:28.005
 Hey!

33:29.040 --> 33:30.607
 Zoe.

33:30.609 --> 33:32.242
 We need this. I know.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.344
 Shane, can you
get me a courier?

34:07.346 --> 34:08.779
 <i> Sure.</i> <i> Actually, uh...</i>

34:10.281 --> 34:11.715
 Never mind. I'll deal with it.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.748
 Hey. Are you looking
for Quinton?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.384
 Um... He's not home.

34:47.386 --> 34:48.784
 Left about an hour ago.

34:50.288 --> 34:53.255
 Oh. Okay.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.559
 Is there something you
wanna leave for him?

34:55.561 --> 34:57.727
 You can leave it with me, Zoe.

34:59.163 --> 35:00.297
 Uh...

35:01.466 --> 35:03.600
 No. How do you know my name?

35:03.602 --> 35:06.269
 Quinton told me all about you.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.271
 He was right.

35:08.273 --> 35:09.706
 You're very beautiful.

35:14.145 --> 35:16.446
 Thank you. That's very nice.

35:31.329 --> 35:34.831
I'm Diamond, by the way.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.301
 Nice to meet you.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.237
 Bit of advice, be careful.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.473
 Quinton's an artist.
He's very...

35:44.742 --> 35:46.643
 Sensitive.

35:46.645 --> 35:47.811
 Uh...

35:49.313 --> 35:50.514
 Okay.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.434
 Zoe? Zoe!

36:13.571 --> 36:15.939
 What... What's going on? Are you...
Look, I can't...

36:15.941 --> 36:17.574
 You all right? I can't do it.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.242
 What do you mean? I can't.
I'm sorry.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.644
 It's not that I don't want to.
Some part of me...

36:20.646 --> 36:22.312
 I'd be lying if I said that.

36:22.314 --> 36:25.348
But my family, my
kids, my husband...

36:25.350 --> 36:27.884
 Look, I...

36:27.886 --> 36:30.187
 I never want to force you into
something you don't want to do.

36:30.189 --> 36:30.854
 Okay.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.624
 Thank you.

36:34.626 --> 36:35.926
"Thank you"?

36:35.928 --> 36:37.594
 Just like that, thank you?
All right.

36:37.596 --> 36:39.396
 Thank you for understanding.
Yeah, yeah.

36:46.437 --> 36:47.737
 Just come here.

36:54.845 --> 36:56.580
 Mmm-mmm-mmm. No, no, no. Stop.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.847
Please. I can't.

37:02.553 --> 37:04.221
 I'll make you a deal.

37:05.990 --> 37:07.624
 Just give me an hour.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.560
 What?

37:10.562 --> 37:11.795
 I wanna show you something.

37:13.798 --> 37:15.465
 I wanna show you
something special.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.469
I bet you do.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.937
 I'm not talking about that.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.941
 It's just, um, some art.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.246
 After that, you can go
home if you want to.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.782
 One hour.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.753
 Okay, one hour. Promise.

37:37.922 --> 37:38.788
 Just one condition.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.792
 Condition? Turn around for me.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.027
 Turn... Yes, turn
around for me.

37:44.029 --> 37:44.995
 Come on. No.

37:46.564 --> 37:47.530
 Come on.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.336
 Quinton... Relax.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.540
 Quinton... Just relax.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.013
 Where are we going?

38:03.015 --> 38:04.281
 Trust me.

38:31.542 --> 38:32.942
Come here.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.647
 Watch your head.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.718
Careful.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.890
 Quinton, where are we?

38:49.428 --> 38:52.395
 I want your first look
to be perfect. Hmm?

38:52.397 --> 38:54.331
 My first look at what?

38:55.566 --> 38:57.400
 Enough. What is it?

39:04.710 --> 39:06.409
 It's beautiful.

39:09.814 --> 39:11.948
I started it when I was 11.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.888
 And I've never shown
this to anyone before.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.031
 Well, is, um, that
you and your family?

39:28.033 --> 39:30.066
No, no.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.635
 That's the family I wanted.

39:32.637 --> 39:34.537
 When I was nine
years old, my mom...

39:35.906 --> 39:37.974
 She ran off with another man.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.977
 We never saw her again.

39:43.447 --> 39:45.048
 I'm so sorry.

39:47.785 --> 39:49.819
 Broke my father's heart.

39:51.622 --> 39:52.789
 He took a gun,

39:54.892 --> 39:55.959
 put it in his mouth.

39:57.828 --> 39:59.562
Oh, my God.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.031
 I know...

40:03.701 --> 40:05.702
 I know things happen
in a marriage,

40:07.104 --> 40:08.972
 but for a mother to
just leave her child

40:08.974 --> 40:10.840
 and never look back, that's...

40:13.778 --> 40:15.745
 I can never get over that.

40:19.084 --> 40:22.952
Oh, Quinton... I know
this is all wrong.

40:26.123 --> 40:27.690
 I know I'm not supposed to...

40:29.126 --> 40:30.994
 To be with another
man's wife, but...

40:33.097 --> 40:34.764
 Zoe, I can't help it.

41:33.524 --> 41:34.491
Thanks, Mr. Crayne.

41:36.126 --> 41:38.161
 Balthazar! Mr. Crayne! Wait!

41:38.163 --> 41:40.096
Wait, wait, wait!

41:40.098 --> 41:41.764
 Hi.

41:41.766 --> 41:44.834
 I'm Zoe. I am so sorry.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.170
 Please don't go.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.606
 Look, I would
completely understand

41:49.608 --> 41:51.708
 if you were furious with
me for being so rude

41:51.710 --> 41:52.976
 and didn't wanna have
anything to do with me,

41:52.978 --> 41:54.544
 but please hear me out.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.280
 I am always on time.

41:57.282 --> 41:59.816
 But my daughter Kayla
was sick tonight

41:59.818 --> 42:02.552
 and I took her to the doctor,

42:02.554 --> 42:04.687
 and I just lost track of time.

42:04.689 --> 42:05.722
 I apologize.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.792
 I'm on a red-eye to Paris.

42:09.794 --> 42:10.994
 And you

42:13.564 --> 42:15.098
 should call my
office to reschedule.

42:16.701 --> 42:18.701
 Thank you for understanding.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.539
 I hope your daughter
feels better.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.007
 Have a safe trip.

42:27.711 --> 42:31.714
 <i> I totally lost track of
time when I was with Quinton.</i>

42:31.716 --> 42:33.883
 I keep using my
kid as an excuse.

42:35.186 --> 42:38.321
 I said my daughter was sick.

42:38.323 --> 42:41.658
 God, you don't wanna put
that out in the universe.

42:43.194 --> 42:46.195
 This is making me crazy. I'm...
I'm so messed up.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.700
 And this obsession...

42:50.702 --> 42:53.069
 I know, I know that
it's ruining my life.

42:53.071 --> 42:56.339
 It's terrible. But
I keep going back.

42:56.341 --> 42:58.675
 So how long have you
been meeting him now?

42:58.677 --> 43:00.877
 Oh, months.

43:00.879 --> 43:02.278
 Every day, if I can.

43:06.850 --> 43:08.952
 Oh, God!

43:08.954 --> 43:11.621
 Oh. Well, thank you so much,

43:11.623 --> 43:14.023
 uh, but I, uh...
I better hurry.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.292
 If I hurry, I can actually
get the kids to bed.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.094
 First time since Monday night.

43:18.096 --> 43:20.229
 Zoe...

43:20.231 --> 43:22.899
 Let's make some
time for next week.

43:22.901 --> 43:24.867
 Yeah, it's just
that, you know...

43:24.869 --> 43:27.637
 I have to see if I
have, well, the time.

43:27.639 --> 43:30.006
 You know, with the kids
and work and Jason...

43:30.008 --> 43:31.941
 See, coming here is just one
more thing that I have to hide.

43:36.914 --> 43:38.881
When can I see it?

43:38.883 --> 43:40.149
 When it's finished.

43:40.151 --> 43:41.384
 When will it be finished?

43:43.687 --> 43:45.755
 You don't like waiting
for anything, do you?

43:45.757 --> 43:47.624
 I thought that's what
you liked about me.

43:49.026 --> 43:53.796
You know what? Um...
Your chin...

43:56.233 --> 43:57.634
No, no...

43:58.769 --> 43:59.669
 Just hold on.

44:02.139 --> 44:05.074
 Zoe, Zoe... Come here.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.176
 Let me see. Come here.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.814
 There you go. Just hold it.
There. Okay...

44:11.816 --> 44:12.715
 Zoe, what are you doing?

44:16.987 --> 44:19.322
 You're a model. Models keep still.
Okay?

44:21.225 --> 44:22.692
 What are you doing?

44:23.994 --> 44:26.162
 You're not helping me here.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.798
 I don't like following orders.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.033
Zoe...

45:10.040 --> 45:11.374
 Quinton?

45:36.133 --> 45:37.900
 That would be cheating.

46:18.375 --> 46:20.443
 Curiosity killed the cat.

46:26.183 --> 46:27.950
 Who are they?

46:27.952 --> 46:29.852
 Some women I used to know.

46:33.524 --> 46:34.957
 This one...

46:37.094 --> 46:38.494
 It's so disturbing.

46:41.932 --> 46:44.333
 Well, I, um... I
paint what I feel.

46:51.208 --> 46:52.575
 She's still stunning.

46:56.013 --> 46:59.282
 They're all so beautiful.

46:59.284 --> 47:00.316
 Are you jealous?

47:02.152 --> 47:03.486
No. I...

47:08.259 --> 47:10.159
 I have no right to be.

47:11.563 --> 47:13.029
 Zoe, come on.

47:13.031 --> 47:14.063
 It's so funny. It's so funny.

47:14.065 --> 47:16.132
 This is crazy.

47:16.134 --> 47:18.167
 What the hell am I doing here?

47:18.169 --> 47:20.870
 What are you doing here?
I mean...

47:20.872 --> 47:22.605
 I think we both know
the answer to that one.

47:22.607 --> 47:24.440
 Yeah, do we?

47:24.442 --> 47:26.342
 Hmm?

47:26.344 --> 47:27.877
 Yeah, we... We know the answer?

47:27.879 --> 47:29.879
 Yeah, we do. Are you
sure I'm not just

47:29.881 --> 47:32.515
 another one of your women that
you've lured into your lair?

47:32.517 --> 47:34.317
 What's wrong with you?
Zoe, come on.

47:34.319 --> 47:36.118
 They're just paintings from
a long time ago, I told you.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.153
Come on.

47:37.155 --> 47:38.421
 I better go.

47:38.423 --> 47:40.056
 Are you serious?

47:41.391 --> 47:43.993
 I don't belong here.

47:43.995 --> 47:45.328
 You do...

47:45.330 --> 47:47.997
 You belong here, Zoe.
You know that.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.233
 Don't say that.

47:50.235 --> 47:53.369
 'Cause nobody... Nobody has
ever made me feel this way.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.371
 Talk this way. Seen my soul.

48:03.881 --> 48:05.882
Okay, trap it. First, trap it.

48:05.884 --> 48:07.950
 Don't plant your
foot too early.

48:07.952 --> 48:09.452
 Mommy!

48:09.454 --> 48:10.519
Put it right next
to the ball, look.

48:10.521 --> 48:11.921
 Hey, honey! How'd it go?

48:11.923 --> 48:13.422
 They won! They did?

48:13.424 --> 48:14.924
Oh, you should have seen him!

48:14.926 --> 48:16.058
 Saved the day.

48:16.060 --> 48:18.160
 Oh, wow! Our star player!

48:18.162 --> 48:19.996
Congratulations!

48:19.998 --> 48:22.231
 That's right. You promised!

48:22.233 --> 48:23.566
Um... Hey, hey, hey, hey!

48:23.568 --> 48:25.301
 Peter, I'm sorry.
I had to work.

48:25.303 --> 48:26.502
 What happened?

48:26.504 --> 48:28.371
 Uh... Client crisis.

48:28.373 --> 48:30.373
 Hey, how's my best girl?

48:31.475 --> 48:33.643
 Momma's a Smurf! Look!

48:33.645 --> 48:35.411
 You've got blue hair!

48:35.413 --> 48:37.280
 Hmm.

48:37.282 --> 48:39.348
 Oh! How'd that get there?

48:39.350 --> 48:41.517
 Occupational hazard, huh?

48:41.519 --> 48:45.087
 Can I get blue hair, too?
Please?

48:45.089 --> 48:47.023
 Come on, stop yanking
on your momma.

48:47.025 --> 48:48.557
Come on. Come here,
silly banana.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.359
 Have some hot chocolate.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.994
 Sit down.

48:51.996 --> 48:54.063
 You want some? Yeah, thank you.

48:54.065 --> 48:57.600
 Hey. I'm sorry. All right?

48:57.602 --> 49:00.703
 Careful. Look at you.

49:02.941 --> 49:04.273
 Messy Bessie. Here.

49:04.275 --> 49:06.642
<i> I was gonna tell him.</i>

49:06.644 --> 49:08.711
<i>- Swear to God.</i>
<i>- Good?</i>

49:08.713 --> 49:11.180
<i> I just couldn't.</i>

49:13.083 --> 49:16.352
 It would destroy
my family, my life.

49:18.121 --> 49:20.556
 I'm sick. I'm really sick.

49:20.558 --> 49:24.226
 Zoe, this is an obvious
sign of addiction here.

49:26.229 --> 49:28.397
 Addiction?

49:28.399 --> 49:29.699
 I'm not on drugs.

49:29.701 --> 49:32.702
 No, you can't smoke it,
shoot it, or snort it.

49:32.704 --> 49:36.072
 But make no mistake,
sex can be a drug, too.

49:36.074 --> 49:38.240
 It's as powerful
as any narcotic.

49:38.242 --> 49:39.976
 Oh, come on. That's crazy.

49:39.978 --> 49:41.277
 No, sexual addiction,

49:41.279 --> 49:44.447
 it's not as common as
alcoholism or drugs.

49:44.449 --> 49:47.283
 But it is a very real problem

49:47.285 --> 49:49.719
 that thousands of people
are battling each day.

49:49.721 --> 49:53.189
 Your first time with a lover
outside of your marriage

49:53.191 --> 49:55.725
 is like your first
hit of heroin.

49:55.727 --> 49:57.626
 The thrill of the illicit.

49:58.762 --> 50:00.696
 Then you keep craving it.

50:00.698 --> 50:02.765
 Okay. Well, then what do I do?

50:04.168 --> 50:06.035
 Because I come here to see you,

50:06.037 --> 50:07.269
 and we talk and we
talk, and we talk.

50:07.271 --> 50:09.505
 But what's the solution?

50:09.507 --> 50:12.775
 I need help! What's the plan?

50:12.777 --> 50:17.346
 Now, you said that you tried
talking to Jason before.

50:17.348 --> 50:20.449
 I think that you should suggest
to him couples counseling.

50:20.451 --> 50:22.685
 Then he'll know there's a
real problem in your marriage.

50:24.087 --> 50:25.221
Okay.

50:26.390 --> 50:28.224
 I'll give it a shot.

51:10.801 --> 51:13.235
I didn't know you got
a new cell phone.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.571
 Oh. Uh...

51:15.573 --> 51:18.340
 Crayne, Balthazar Crayne,
you know, that investor guy.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.675
 One of his companies sells them

51:19.677 --> 51:22.344
 and they gave them
out as promos.

51:22.346 --> 51:23.679
That's pretty snazzy.

51:23.681 --> 51:25.214
 Oops.

51:25.216 --> 51:27.750
 Oh. Here, I'll take it.
That's okay.

51:27.752 --> 51:29.285
 I think that's your new
millionaire boyfriend calling.

51:34.192 --> 51:37.793
 Oh, please. Yeah. That's
all I need in my life.

51:37.795 --> 51:39.395
 Another man.

51:39.397 --> 51:41.464
 You are all the
man that I need.

51:41.466 --> 51:43.299
 Really? Mmm-hmm.

51:44.334 --> 51:45.401
 Mmm.

51:50.674 --> 51:52.675
 What's on your mind, baby?

51:52.677 --> 51:53.776
 Hmm?

51:54.878 --> 51:59.148
Uh... Yeah, you know, actually,

51:59.150 --> 52:02.118
 there is a problem that
we should talk about.

52:02.120 --> 52:04.120
 A problem? Mmm-hmm.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.589
 What's the problem?

52:06.591 --> 52:07.890
 Maybe you and I should
talk to somebody.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.794
 Talk to who? About what?

52:11.796 --> 52:15.564
 Uh, a professional, about our...
Our sex life.

52:18.870 --> 52:21.770
 What's wrong... What's
wrong with our sex life?

52:23.573 --> 52:25.541
 Wait, hold on. What do you
mean by "a professional"?

52:25.543 --> 52:28.544
 You know, a therapist.

52:28.546 --> 52:33.149
 I'm not gonna talk to a
shrink about anything.

52:33.151 --> 52:35.818
 Especially not our
personal affairs.

52:35.820 --> 52:37.620
 Half of those
people are crooks.

52:37.622 --> 52:39.321
 That's ridiculous.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.323
 No, no. Ridiculous is
the money they spend

52:41.325 --> 52:43.893
 on some fake doctor to
listen to their problems.

52:43.895 --> 52:46.495
 Wow. I didn't know you
hated an entire profession.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.497
 Look, sweetie,

52:48.499 --> 52:52.301
 we have always talked
about everything, right?

52:52.303 --> 52:55.404
 Why would we need to bring
somebody in, a total stranger,

52:55.406 --> 52:57.573
 and have them get in between us?
Hmm?

52:57.575 --> 52:59.208
 Jason, why aren't
you listening to me?

52:59.210 --> 53:01.477
 I mean, I think that...
You know, maybe...

53:01.479 --> 53:04.246
 Listen to you, listen to you.
...it would be a good...

53:04.248 --> 53:05.848
 Come here, sweetie.

53:05.850 --> 53:08.551
 You're exhausted.
You work too hard.

53:09.653 --> 53:12.621
 All right, we both do.

53:12.623 --> 53:14.456
 Tell you what.

53:14.458 --> 53:17.459
 Why don't we go to that
French place on Saturday?

53:17.461 --> 53:20.529
 The one you like.
With the candles.

53:20.531 --> 53:23.566
 Have some wine, hmm? Mmm.

53:23.568 --> 53:26.802
Yes. Um... I need
to take a walk.

53:29.372 --> 53:32.441
 Okay, that's a good idea.
Get some fresh air.

53:32.443 --> 53:34.843
 I'll finish up.

53:34.845 --> 53:35.778
 Our love is forever.

53:41.851 --> 53:43.852
 Always has been.

53:44.921 --> 53:46.655
 Always will be.

54:06.510 --> 54:09.411
 Wow.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.914
 Quinton, that was great.
I needed that.

54:14.684 --> 54:16.252
 Yeah, yeah, me, too.

54:19.723 --> 54:20.990
 Mmm...

54:27.364 --> 54:28.497
 You okay?

54:28.499 --> 54:29.365
 Yeah, I'm okay.

54:30.533 --> 54:32.668
 I'm okay.

54:32.670 --> 54:34.570
 Actually...

54:34.572 --> 54:38.641
 Actually, I'm not okay.
I'm not okay. I, uh...

54:38.643 --> 54:39.875
 I think we need to talk.

54:39.877 --> 54:41.277
 Talk about what?

54:41.279 --> 54:43.012
 About us. About
the whole thing.

54:43.014 --> 54:45.414
 I mean, it has been great
and everything, but...

54:45.416 --> 54:47.383
 But what?

54:51.755 --> 54:53.455
 Leave your husband
and be with me.

54:57.661 --> 54:59.628
 I can't.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.563
 You can't? Why the hell not?
I can't.

55:01.565 --> 55:03.565
 I can't leave Jason.
Tell me, tell me why not.

55:03.567 --> 55:04.933
 Tell me. I wanna know.

55:04.935 --> 55:07.836
 Because Jason's my life.

55:07.838 --> 55:09.838
 Yeah, and that's why you're here
with me every chance you get?

55:09.840 --> 55:11.640
 Oh, Quinton, come on,

55:11.642 --> 55:12.608
 you knew that I was
married when we met.

55:12.610 --> 55:14.376
 What'd you expect?

55:14.378 --> 55:16.412
 I didn't expect anything. I
don't know what to expect.

55:16.414 --> 55:18.514
 I didn't expect to fall in
love with you and I did!

55:19.884 --> 55:22.918
 And I know you've
thought about it.

55:22.920 --> 55:25.587
 I look at you and I see it.
I feel it.

55:25.589 --> 55:26.855
 It's more than just
sex to you, too.

55:27.891 --> 55:29.525
 I can't!

55:31.361 --> 55:34.363
 I have two kids! I have a family.
I can't.

56:03.760 --> 56:06.462
 I want to have a family, too.

56:06.464 --> 56:07.996
 With you.

56:43.032 --> 56:44.800
<i> He changed the rules on me.</i>

56:44.802 --> 56:46.168
<i> He wasn't supposed to do that.</i>

56:46.170 --> 56:48.771
 He changed the rules?

56:48.773 --> 56:50.139
 Okay. We both did.

56:50.141 --> 56:51.874
 Hmm.

56:51.876 --> 56:54.843
 But, I mean, Jason
wasn't listening.

56:54.845 --> 56:56.412
 Damn, Quinton was right.

56:56.414 --> 56:58.013
 I could picture
myself with him.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.581
 How does that make
you feel, Zoe?

56:59.583 --> 57:01.884
 Like I was cheating
with my heart.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.952
 Which is not what
I signed on for.

57:03.954 --> 57:05.721
 This is not what I need.

57:05.723 --> 57:07.089
 What do you need?

58:01.778 --> 58:04.179
 Oh, yeah? You want it in?

58:04.181 --> 58:05.848
 Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

58:27.604 --> 58:28.971
Come on.

58:31.608 --> 58:33.175
 Yeah, you like that? Huh?

58:49.826 --> 58:51.560
 My name is Corey.

58:51.562 --> 58:54.196
 Mmm.

58:54.198 --> 58:57.099
<i> I've never done it
like that before.</i>

58:57.101 --> 58:59.968
 I enjoyed every minute of it.

59:01.839 --> 59:03.572
 Is there medication?

59:03.574 --> 59:06.275
 You know, some kind of pill
that you can prescribe?

59:06.277 --> 59:08.777
 Oh, Lord. I even
sound like an addict.

59:08.779 --> 59:10.812
 You know that we never
really got a chance

59:10.814 --> 59:12.848
 to talk about your
childhood in Dallas,

59:12.850 --> 59:15.183
 before you moved to Atlanta.

59:15.185 --> 59:17.219
 Oh, I don't remember
any of that.

59:17.221 --> 59:20.055
 You were 10 years old
when you moved, right?

59:20.057 --> 59:22.024
 I'm telling you, I don't
remember anything.

59:22.026 --> 59:23.725
 Jason teases me about it.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.862
 He says it's because my
life began when I met him.

59:26.864 --> 59:28.130
 So when'd you get that scar?

59:29.699 --> 59:32.701
 Was that before Atlanta?

59:32.703 --> 59:34.703
 Uh... God, I've
always had this.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.271
 Why? What does it matter?

59:36.273 --> 59:39.875
 Because, Zoe, the past can
help us understand the present.

59:39.877 --> 59:43.211
 So we really do need to
explore every avenue,

59:43.213 --> 59:44.880
 in order to help make you well.

59:47.216 --> 59:50.719
 Oh. I gotta go.

59:50.721 --> 59:53.922
 Listen, I will try to
remember more, for next week.

59:57.193 --> 59:59.294
 I do wanna get better.

01:00:00.296 --> 01:00:02.331
 And you will.

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.865
 Oh!

01:00:20.817 --> 01:00:22.317
 You like that?

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:24.286
 Oh, God, yes.

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:25.754
What do you like about it?

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:27.322
 Everything.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:45.907
Zoe?

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.345
 Zoe?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.913
 Come in.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:55.083
Zoe... You all right?

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:57.052
Um...

01:00:57.054 --> 01:01:00.956
 Oh, there's just something going
around at the kids' school.

01:01:00.958 --> 01:01:02.124
 What's up?

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:06.995
 We need to go over the
numbers for this quarter,

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:07.996
and they are not good.

01:01:10.767 --> 01:01:12.034
 Here...

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.888
 Quinton?

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:39.728
 Hmm.

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:48.970
<i> Little busy. Just
leave it at the beep.</i>

01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:51.873
 Hey, it's me.

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.142
 I see your car downstairs,
but I don't see you.

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:55.911
 Where are you?

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:16.765
 Oh, shit!

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:17.733
 Hey, you wanna join us?

01:02:22.939 --> 01:02:23.905
 What's wrong with her?

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.074
 Zoe, listen to me.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.176
 Don't touch me, you pig!

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:30.245
 Can we talk it over, please?

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.247
 Why don't you talk it over with
your little trick over there, huh?

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.016
 Bitch! I don't even know
what's going on with you two.

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:36.384
 I don't wanna know.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:38.320
 I mean, you can stay
and watch if you want.

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:39.488
 Zoe, I know it's fucked
up, but, please...

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.823
 This whole thing is fucked up!

01:02:41.825 --> 01:02:43.258
 This whole thing is fucked up!

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.226
 Yeah, you know what?
You're absolutely right!

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:45.927
 It's fucked up completely!

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.329
 'Cause you get to go to
your husband every night.

01:02:47.331 --> 01:02:48.530
 And what? What do you
expect me to do, Zoe?

01:02:48.532 --> 01:02:49.898
 Just wait here for you?
Is that what...

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.399
 Is that what you want me to do?

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.068
 Zoe, I'm talking to you!
What do you want me to do?

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.870
Come here, Zoe.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.838
Listen, Zoe.

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:59.341
 Zoe, I asked you to be with me.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:01.543
 I asked you.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.211
 What do you want me to do?

01:03:03.213 --> 01:03:04.813
 Tell me. Whatever you
want me to do, I'll do it.

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:06.081
 What do you want?

01:03:06.083 --> 01:03:08.083
 What the fuck did
you want from me?

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.920
 Nothing.

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.389
 I don't want a damn thing.

01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:29.304
 Hi, baby.

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:32.507
 What's wrong?

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.823
 You okay?

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.295
 What's going on?

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:58.500
 Just... Bad day.

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:01.102
 Hey, you know if you're in
trouble, you can always stay here.

01:04:03.973 --> 01:04:07.042
 I feel we have a connection.

01:04:07.044 --> 01:04:08.476
 Hmm. So you know I
got your back, right?

01:04:10.012 --> 01:04:10.879
 I'll take care of you.

01:04:12.248 --> 01:04:13.114
 I'm okay.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.320
 Just fuck me.

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:19.521
 Oh, that's what you want, huh?

01:04:19.523 --> 01:04:20.589
 Mmm-hmm.

01:04:20.591 --> 01:04:21.590
 Yeah, you like that.

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:23.525
 Oh, yeah.

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:27.562
 Slide back, baby.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.431
 Let me get up there
and do that for you.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.299
 I'll give it to you all day.

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:44.212
 Choke me.

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:45.547
 You like that?

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:46.414
 You like it, don't you?

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.518
Yeah.

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:15.543
 Good night, Mommy.
Good night, sweetie.

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.982
 Okay. Good night, Mom.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.384
 Good night.

01:05:22.386 --> 01:05:24.452
 I think I'm a little too
old to be tucked in.

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:26.187
Okay.

01:05:38.234 --> 01:05:39.234
 Momma, I'll be back.

01:05:51.314 --> 01:05:52.647
Oh, yeah.

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.083
Yes!

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.583
 Uh-huh.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:30.218
 Open up.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.419
 There you go.

01:06:34.323 --> 01:06:36.091
Yeah! Harder.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.678
 You try it.

01:06:57.781 --> 01:06:59.147
 No.

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:00.382
 Go ahead.

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:02.050
 Are you sure?

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.184
 Yeah, baby, just do it.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:14.129
 Ah!

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:21.136
 Don't stop.

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:11.286
 You've missed every
single soccer game.

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:18.393
 Kayla's asking where
you go at night.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:22.596
 I tried explaining to
her, but I couldn't.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.299
 So, maybe you can
explain it to me.

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.772
 Why? You're the only person
allowed to work late?

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:35.176
 I work. I don't disappear.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:36.778
 Do you know how many
nights that I've stayed up

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.113
 waiting up for you?

01:08:38.115 --> 01:08:39.214
 Oh, I'm in my office.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:41.149
 I answer your calls.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:42.550
 You always know where I am.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.586
 I don't know anything.

01:08:44.587 --> 01:08:45.687
 I don't know what
you do at work.

01:08:45.689 --> 01:08:47.455
 I don't know who you talk to.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.323
 I don't know what
you're doing with them.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.693
 I mean, I work, too, Jason.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.627
I mean, what?

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.296
 My work's not as important,

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:57.698
 because I don't make
as much money as you?

01:08:57.701 --> 01:08:59.300
 Okay, stop it!

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:03.238
 This is about the kids. Is it?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.173
 No, I think this is about us.

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:07.442
 I think we should talk
about what's missing.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.313
 What's missing?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.149
 Okay, let me see. We
got a beautiful home,

01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:16.651
 beautiful kids, we
got great careers.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.921
 What the hell else do you want?

01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:22.290
 Yeah, everything's perfect.
Look, I want you.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:26.227
I want more from you.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:28.296
 I mean, I want
you to loosen up.

01:09:28.298 --> 01:09:30.698
 You know? If you just
loosened up, and I could...

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:35.370
 I could take us to
places that is just...

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:39.307
 That's just so amazing.

01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:41.309
 Hmm?

01:09:41.310 --> 01:09:44.712
 I mean, you know, we
could try new things...

01:09:45.948 --> 01:09:47.582
 Experiment.

01:09:49.518 --> 01:09:50.852
 You know? Okay, who
the hell are you?

01:09:53.656 --> 01:09:55.390
 I'm your wife!
No, no, no, no...

01:09:55.392 --> 01:09:57.492
 My wife tells me when
something is wrong.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.394
 I tried. My wife... My wife

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:01.863
 tells me about her day,
makes time for her family,

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.464
 and she doesn't get a
fancy new cell phone

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:05.767
 and then lie about it.
And what is this?

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.638
Condoms? I... We
never use condoms!

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.607
 You went through my bag?

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:14.676
 Since when do you care if
I see what's in your bag?

01:10:16.279 --> 01:10:18.880
 Jason, I told you that
I went to the doctor.

01:10:18.882 --> 01:10:20.648
 I wasn't feeling
well, and so we...

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:21.749
 I got off the pill.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:33.661
 Okay, look...

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:34.762
 You know I would do
anything for you, right?

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.266
 Okay?

01:10:38.268 --> 01:10:40.335
 I love you more
than life itself.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:42.337
 You can talk to me.

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:43.738
 Yeah, well...

01:10:45.608 --> 01:10:47.508
 You could do me right here.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.010
 What?

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:50.912
Do me right here.

01:10:50.914 --> 01:10:52.547
 Come on. The kids are asleep.

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:56.951
 You don't get it, do you?

01:10:58.387 --> 01:10:59.454
 Okay.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.924
 I want my wife back.

01:11:02.926 --> 01:11:04.826
I'm right here.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:47.969
 What's going on?

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.840
Okay...

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.387
 Uh, word is

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:08.523
 Preston Ellis is
going over to ARC.

01:12:10.359 --> 01:12:11.659
 Well, get him on the phone.
I'll try and...

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:13.628
 There's more.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.531
 Both Kanisha Wylie and Rob
Diaz are going with him.

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.666
 Oh, damn it.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:21.402
 And I think that's a letter from
Alfred Conteh's lawyer on your desk.

01:12:21.404 --> 01:12:24.038
 He's suddenly decided he
doesn't need representation.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:26.341
 Oh, well, forget him.
He's an idiot.

01:12:26.343 --> 01:12:27.075
 Is he?

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:31.679
 What? What's your problem?

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.481
 My problem?

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.350
 Oh, well, let's see.

01:12:35.352 --> 01:12:39.821
 I have no life, because
I work my ass off 24/7,

01:12:39.823 --> 01:12:41.923
 to keep a company
going for a boss

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:45.360
 who hasn't given a shit about
the business for months now.

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:46.761
 And now I'm trying
to figure out

01:12:46.763 --> 01:12:48.629
 how I'm gonna make my rent.

01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:49.997
 Because my boss,

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:53.768
 who is also supposed
to be my best friend,

01:12:53.770 --> 01:12:56.771
 can't even see that we might
not make payroll next week.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:57.872
 How's that for a problem?

01:13:05.914 --> 01:13:08.049
 I'm tapped out. We're done.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:09.784
 Mmm-mmm, no.

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:11.886
 You don't get to give up now.

01:13:13.756 --> 01:13:17.859
 You know, I came to work here
because I believed in you.

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:19.961
 You were a visionary.

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.397
 The girl who could...
Who could spot talent

01:13:22.399 --> 01:13:25.733
 in a kid painting on
the side of a building.

01:13:25.735 --> 01:13:28.403
 If anyone can fix
this, you can.

01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:30.471
 But you need to act.

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:32.073
 Do what you do best.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:35.543
 Bring in that big artist.
Have that great idea.

01:13:35.545 --> 01:13:37.578
 You know, this is it, Zoe.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.647
 Sink or swim. It is up to you.

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.917
 And I will do
anything you need.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.119
 But do not just
disappear on me.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.073
 So where do I sign?

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.686
 I'm just kidding.

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:54.155
 I'm happy to have you back,
whatever the reason is.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.632
 Who is it?

01:15:04.634 --> 01:15:05.600
 Oh, they're early.

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:15.243
 Hey, Quinton. Hey, man.

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:17.078
 Good to see you.
Good to see you, too.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.213
 Ed and Aaron are gonna
meet us at the restaurant.

01:15:19.215 --> 01:15:22.083
 But I don't believe you've met our
chief architect, Mr. Jason Reynard.

01:15:22.085 --> 01:15:23.618
 Pleasure.

01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:25.052
- Mr. Jason.
- All right.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.022
 Pleasure to meet you, man.
Yeah.

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:29.257
 Since you'll be
doing the mural,

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:31.192
 I wanted Jason to see
your work firsthand.

01:15:31.194 --> 01:15:32.627
 Yeah, no problem. Of course.

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:38.766
 Excuse me, gentlemen,
I have to take this.

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:40.234
 This is Benny. Yep.

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.572
 Wow.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.707
 You're talented.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.943
 Thank you.

01:15:48.945 --> 01:15:50.111
 Whoa, this is...

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.314
 This is... It's beautiful.

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:02.623
 It's disturbing.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.228
Disturbing... Yeah. Hmm.

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:12.700
 I love it.

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:18.072
 You know, my wife, she
would love your stuff.

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.073
- Really?
- Mmm.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:20.641
 She represents artists.

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:21.976
 Started her own agency
from the ground up.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.246
 Wow, that's nice. Hmm.

01:16:25.248 --> 01:16:27.982
 I'm gonna get you
a card for her.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:31.218
 She's got a great eye, and
she's a marketing genius.

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.156
 I'm sure she could make you
a mint in reproductions.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.723
Jason?

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:10.958
 We should get going. Our
reservations are for 6:30.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.860
All right.

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.662
 Let's go.

01:17:14.664 --> 01:17:16.797
Let's go celebrate and
have some drinks.

01:17:16.799 --> 01:17:17.665
 Well...

01:17:20.869 --> 01:17:23.204
 All right. Nice.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.848
 I gotta handle
something real quick.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.216
 Meet you guys in a few.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:45.359
 All right.

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.140
 You weren't gonna
stop him, were you?

01:18:05.947 --> 01:18:09.116
 Here. I... I gotta go.

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.386
 Have a dinner with a client.

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:45.886
I'm ready to go. Come on.

01:18:45.888 --> 01:18:47.788
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.356
I don't wanna miss
the previews, guys.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.229
 I wanna do it myself!

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.997
 Jesus, Kayla, okay,
look, you know,

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.365
 the movies are gonna start
with or without us, guys.

01:18:58.367 --> 01:18:59.400
 I know. It's up to you.

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:00.868
 Hey, where are you guys going?

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:02.236
 Some new Disney
thing at Phipps.

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.971
 We didn't think
you'd wanna come.

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.173
Course not.

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:08.409
 I wanna come. You
can have my ticket.

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.478
 You better hurry, the movie
starts in 15 minutes.

01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:13.080
 Oh, great. Now we're gonna
miss the movie because of you.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:14.215
 I don't wanna miss the movie!

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:15.816
 We're not gonna miss the movie!

01:19:15.818 --> 01:19:18.385
 Just put your shoe on, Kayla.
Come on.

01:19:18.387 --> 01:19:20.821
 No, it's fine. You
guys go ahead.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:22.823
 You sure? Yeah.

01:19:22.825 --> 01:19:25.826
 Have fun. I'll make cookies
for when you get back.

01:19:25.828 --> 01:19:27.194
Cookies! Yay! Cookies.

01:19:27.196 --> 01:19:28.295
- Bye, Peter.
- All right.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:30.030
 See you in a couple hours.

01:19:30.032 --> 01:19:31.398
Hey, Kayla, you know I'm
in the front, right?

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.500
Whatever. Just whatever.

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.046
<i> So</i> <i> how did that make you
feel,</i> <i> being left alone?</i>

01:19:46.048 --> 01:19:48.115
 Horrible.

01:19:48.117 --> 01:19:50.050
 Like I lost my family.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:51.919
 Zoe, we need to talk
about your childhood.

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:57.024
 You know what, Dr. Spencer?

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.227
 This is not working for me.

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:03.130
 What is it about your past
that scares you so much?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:04.498
 See, there you go again.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.168
 All the same questions.
No answers.

01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:10.471
 You just sit there,
100 bucks an hour,

01:20:10.473 --> 01:20:13.207
 and all you do is ask the
same stupid questions!

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:14.875
 And nothing changes!

01:20:14.877 --> 01:20:17.845
 It's okay for you
to be frustrated.

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:20.347
 Or scared.

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:23.217
 But you have got to take
control over your life now,

01:20:23.219 --> 01:20:26.320
 before this addiction ruins it.

01:20:26.322 --> 01:20:28.889
 You need to confront
your lovers,

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:31.258
 call it quits and
go cold turkey.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:33.928
 And then you can begin
to claim your life back.

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.229
 It may sound like a lot,

01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:37.498
 but I promise you
it will be okay.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.600
 It's not okay! None
of this is okay!

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.237
 You know what? Jason was right.

01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:45.039
 People need to handle
their own damn problems.

01:20:45.041 --> 01:20:47.374
 Paying you to listen to
me is not the solution.

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.009
 Then what's the solution?

01:20:49.011 --> 01:20:51.111
 I need to sort this out on my own.
Thank you.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:54.281
 Zoe, you can't keep
running from your past.

01:20:54.283 --> 01:20:56.283
 Because sooner or later,
it's gonna catch up with you.

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:57.418
 You can't keep running!

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:01.522
- What the hell?
- Thank you.

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:03.257
- Have a good day.
- You, too.

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:45.299
 What did he want?

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.104
 Slow down, honey.

01:21:50.106 --> 01:21:51.538
 You're gonna give
yourself a heart attack.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:52.973
 Momma!

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:54.308
 What did that man want?

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:56.677
 He was a messenger.
You have a package.

01:22:01.983 --> 01:22:03.250
 Ugh!

01:22:03.252 --> 01:22:04.652
 What is it, honey?
What's the matter?

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.955
 It's fine. Are the kids inside?

01:22:07.957 --> 01:22:09.390
 Of course. They're upstairs
doing their homework.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:12.593
 What is it?

01:22:12.595 --> 01:22:14.161
 Do you wanna talk to
me about something?

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:18.299
 Oh... Momma, I...

01:22:21.269 --> 01:22:22.636
 It's fine.

01:22:29.644 --> 01:22:30.978
 Hey, babe.

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:32.479
 Hey.

01:22:32.481 --> 01:22:34.415
 What's that?

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.283
 It's from Quinton Canosa.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.119
Uh, the artist?

01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.721
 Yeah.

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:42.456
 He's doing the mural
for the civic center.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.625
 He's the most generous guy.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.127
 I went to his place, saw
this, told him I loved it.

01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:49.396
 He sent it over as a gift.
And a note.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:53.200
Okay, Jason, I, um...
Look, um...

01:22:53.202 --> 01:22:55.502
 Here. "You told me
your wife loves art,

01:22:55.504 --> 01:22:58.305
 "and I hope she
enjoys this as well."

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.574
 Amazing.

01:23:00.576 --> 01:23:01.642
 Can I even accept
something like this?

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:06.213
Honestly. Uh... What's wrong?

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:08.082
 Oh, God. I am...

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:10.551
You know, I had bad sushi.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.488
 It's heavy, too. You know?

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.023
 It's gotta be worth a mint.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:19.426
You all right?

01:23:21.196 --> 01:23:22.563
 Babe.

01:23:41.516 --> 01:23:43.384
 Hey. Surprise.

01:23:48.423 --> 01:23:50.724
 You want a drink?

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:53.293
 Want a brandy?

01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:56.430
 Maybe a... Maybe a
wine for the lady?

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.298
 Tell me what makes you happy.
Tell me what makes you smile.

01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:00.534
 Tell me. Come on.
What do you want?

01:24:00.536 --> 01:24:03.704
 I can't see you
anymore, Quinton.

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.606
You can't see me anymore?

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:07.608
 Zoe, come on. Zoe...

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.545
If it's because of my gift,

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:13.080
 I was just fucking
around, all right?

01:24:13.082 --> 01:24:14.448
 I was just playing around.
I was just...

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:16.116
 No, it's not because
of the stupid statue.

01:24:16.118 --> 01:24:18.519
 Then what is it? What is it?
Tell me, what is it?

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:22.389
 Oh, my God. Come here.
Please come here.

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:24.358
 Please don't make this any
harder than it has to be.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.759
 Okay?

01:24:28.096 --> 01:24:29.830
 Quinton.

01:24:29.832 --> 01:24:31.632
 Quinton, I need you to hear me.

01:24:31.634 --> 01:24:33.700
 I am listening to you.

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:36.203
 I am listening to you. Okay?

01:24:36.205 --> 01:24:37.504
 Zoe?

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:38.839
 Who the fuck are you?

01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:41.241
 Who the fuck am I?
Who the fuck are you?

01:24:41.243 --> 01:24:43.510
 I got an urgent text
from her to come here.

01:24:43.512 --> 01:24:45.279
 Zoe, who is this dude?

01:24:45.281 --> 01:24:47.314
 Look, I'm sorry.

01:24:47.316 --> 01:24:48.649
 I only wanna do this once.

01:24:50.151 --> 01:24:51.185
Do what?

01:24:52.654 --> 01:24:55.189
 Wait. You fucking
this guy, too?

01:24:55.191 --> 01:24:56.623
 You fuck... What?

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:04.832
 Wow.

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.268
 Wow.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.437
 It seems Ms. Zoe has been
cheating not only on her husband,

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.873
 but on me, too. Huh?

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.541
 Is that right?

01:25:14.543 --> 01:25:17.678
 You brought me all the
way down here to confess?

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.279
 Is anybody else coming?

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:21.381
 I mean, I don't know.
Maybe we can form a...

01:25:21.383 --> 01:25:23.117
 We can form a support group,
some shit like that, huh?

01:25:23.119 --> 01:25:24.852
 Stop! Just stop!

01:25:24.854 --> 01:25:27.454
 Look, I got you both
here at the same time

01:25:27.456 --> 01:25:28.689
 to tell you that it's over.

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:30.324
 This has got to stop, okay?

01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:32.626
 I love my husband,
I love my children,

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:34.628
 and I don't wanna
see you again.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.530
 So you think this is okay?

01:25:36.532 --> 01:25:37.865
 You can fuck anybody you want

01:25:37.867 --> 01:25:40.334
 and then it's just,
what, it's goodbye?

01:25:40.336 --> 01:25:43.737
 Don't you get it? I
can't control myself.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.509
 It doesn't matter who I screw.
I'm sick.

01:25:48.511 --> 01:25:50.177
 Asshole.

01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:51.345
You got a mouth on you.

01:25:51.347 --> 01:25:52.779
 Listen to me!

01:25:54.182 --> 01:25:55.282
 Get off me, man!

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.589
 Look, I got no
beef with you, man.

01:26:11.867 --> 01:26:13.934
 Hey, buddy. You good?

01:26:17.505 --> 01:26:19.239
 He's not answering me.

01:26:20.575 --> 01:26:21.775
 Oh, Zoe...

01:26:23.378 --> 01:26:25.412
 You wanna know something, Zoe?

01:26:25.414 --> 01:26:26.880
 You know, since I
was a little boy,

01:26:26.882 --> 01:26:29.816
 people would just
walk away from me.

01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:30.951
 Just walk out of my life.

01:26:33.188 --> 01:26:34.922
 You're not gonna
walk away from me.

01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:36.757
 You're not gonna leave me.

01:26:36.759 --> 01:26:37.925
 Don't come near me.

01:26:37.927 --> 01:26:40.894
 Oh, you're scared of me now?

01:26:40.896 --> 01:26:43.463
 What, my touch isn't
good enough for you now?

01:26:43.465 --> 01:26:45.632
 Tell me! I'm fucking
asking you something!

01:26:45.634 --> 01:26:48.535
 Look, let's just
talk about it, okay?

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:49.770
 Just calm down.

01:26:49.772 --> 01:26:51.305
 Oh, no, no, no.

01:26:51.307 --> 01:26:52.806
 We're not gonna talk
about shit anymore,

01:26:52.808 --> 01:26:54.341
 you fucking little bitch.

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:54.875
 We're not gonna
talk about anything.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.443
 Do you hear me?

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:03.550
 Oh, you fucking bitch.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.285
 That was not nice.

01:27:06.754 --> 01:27:08.889
 That was not nice.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:17.764
 Very fucking painful.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.901
 You see...

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:27.774
 Very fucking painful,
you fucking bitch.

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.445
 Come over here,
you fucking bitch!

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.981
 Where are you going?

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:11.285
Please let me go!

01:28:11.287 --> 01:28:12.386
 Don't, Quinton!

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:29.736
 Think I'm gonna hurt you?

01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:31.405
 I won't hurt you.

01:28:31.407 --> 01:28:35.375
You know, all I
ever wanted to do,

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:37.511
 was to have some
good sex with you.

01:28:37.513 --> 01:28:39.379
 That's all.

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:44.384
But you... You made me want you.

01:28:44.386 --> 01:28:45.919
 You made me need you!

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.857
 What you looking at? Don't
look at me like that.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.795
 I told you to leave
your fucking husband,

01:28:54.797 --> 01:28:56.463
 but you wouldn't listen to me.

01:28:56.465 --> 01:28:58.765
 Because you're a
little selfish bitch.

01:28:58.767 --> 01:29:00.400
 That's why.

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:05.972
 You know that I would never
hurt you like you hurt me.

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:07.007
 I would never do that to you.

01:29:07.009 --> 01:29:09.042
 I would never do that to you!

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:22.489
 Look at you.

01:29:22.491 --> 01:29:24.024
 Look at you, you're
so fucking beautiful.

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:25.759
 You're so beautiful.

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:27.694
 I'm gonna make sure...

01:29:27.696 --> 01:29:31.898
 I'm gonna make sure your
last thoughts are of me.

01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:34.067
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:36.603
 Okay?

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.073
Zoe?

01:29:48.416 --> 01:29:49.416
 You can have that back.

01:29:54.021 --> 01:29:54.921
 You left this on
the kitchen table.

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:57.591
 Told me all I need to know.

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:02.529
 Jason?

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.499
 Jason, wait!

01:30:05.501 --> 01:30:07.067
 This motherfucker's just crazy.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.140
 What the hell happened?

01:30:13.142 --> 01:30:17.611
Jesus. Quinton...
What did you do?

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:21.715
 Hey, baby...

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.484
 Hey...

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:34.161
 Jason, please.
Please hear me out.

01:30:34.163 --> 01:30:35.495
 I don't need to hear
a goddamn thing.

01:30:37.432 --> 01:30:38.598
 Got a pretty clear
picture here.

01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.901
Oh, I am beyond sorry...
You're sorry?

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:43.904
 Look, I know that I lied.

01:30:43.906 --> 01:30:45.472
 But I'm not lying
to you right now

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:47.841
 when I say that I've
been seeing a doctor.

01:30:47.843 --> 01:30:49.109
 And she's been helping
me with my condition.

01:30:51.479 --> 01:30:52.779
 That's the technical term

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:54.047
 for "screwing around
on your husband"?

01:30:55.783 --> 01:30:57.117
 Oh, God. Jason...

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:00.987
 I know I fucked up.
I know I did.

01:31:00.989 --> 01:31:02.522
 But I love you and you love me!

01:31:02.524 --> 01:31:03.957
 And I think we can work it out.

01:31:03.959 --> 01:31:05.158
 Yeah, let's all have therapy!

01:31:06.828 --> 01:31:08.128
 It'll all be great!

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.832
 Look, you can't just throw
away everything we...

01:31:11.834 --> 01:31:13.166
 You threw it away!

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:16.870
 You screwed around!

01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:20.073
 You put our kids in danger!

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.844
 I never cheated on you.

01:31:23.846 --> 01:31:25.245
 You were my life.

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.083
 I'm still your life.

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:35.789
 You are a lying,
cheating whore.

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.558
 Okay?

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.527
 We are done.

01:31:40.529 --> 01:31:41.862
 Through. It's over.

01:31:44.866 --> 01:31:45.899
 And you won't be
getting the kids.

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:52.105
 You don't mean that.

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:56.576
 You're dead to me.

01:31:56.578 --> 01:31:58.044
 You hear me?

01:31:58.046 --> 01:31:59.946
 You're fucking dead.

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:13.827
 Without you, I am dead.

01:32:22.703 --> 01:32:23.670
 Zoe!

01:33:27.134 --> 01:33:28.268
 I can't believe
it came to this.

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:29.202
 Me neither.

01:34:01.103 --> 01:34:02.969
<i> You can't escape!</i>

01:34:29.897 --> 01:34:32.198
 I'm sorry. I don't
think I can do this.

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:36.269
 What? Jason, what is it?

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.708
 All those people
you were with...

01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:45.245
 When I look at you,
that's all I can see.

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:56.890
Surprise!

01:34:56.892 --> 01:34:58.158
Whoo!

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:03.029
Wow.

01:35:03.031 --> 01:35:04.464
 Hi.

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:06.366
 Is it okay to hug you? I
don't wanna break you.

01:35:06.368 --> 01:35:09.369
 Oh, break my heart
is more like it.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:11.438
 Come here. Go ahead.

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:12.906
 I love you, Mom.

01:35:12.908 --> 01:35:14.140
 I love you more.

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:18.078
 Come here.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.879
 I missed you all.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:21.748
Me, too.

01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:23.950
I'm glad you're home.

01:36:15.469 --> 01:36:17.270
Hi, Brina.

01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:18.905
 She's in there, watching TV.

01:36:18.907 --> 01:36:20.173
Okay.

01:36:26.047 --> 01:36:27.347
 What is this?

01:36:27.349 --> 01:36:29.048
 You don't even like television.

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:31.885
 It's numbing.

01:36:31.887 --> 01:36:33.520
 What the hell are
you doing, Zoe?

01:36:33.522 --> 01:36:36.256
 You've been sitting in
this house for months now.

01:36:36.258 --> 01:36:38.391
 The pity party
officially ends today.

01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:42.362
 Look, I need more time.
Mmm-mmm.

01:36:42.364 --> 01:36:44.130
 Your time is up.

01:36:44.132 --> 01:36:45.532
 You need to get up,

01:36:45.534 --> 01:36:48.368
 and get your behind
back to work.

01:36:48.370 --> 01:36:51.371
 This ain't fair to you or
those beautiful kids of yours.

01:36:51.373 --> 01:36:53.039
 Now, come on.

01:36:53.041 --> 01:36:54.974
 Come on. Uh-uh.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:56.442
 I'm not... I'm not ready
to go anywhere yet.

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:57.944
 I'm not ready to go.

01:36:57.946 --> 01:37:00.046
 Dr. Spencer called
this morning again.

01:37:01.249 --> 01:37:02.482
 Says you're not
taking her call.

01:37:04.084 --> 01:37:05.485
 She asked that I make
sure you get this.

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.358
 You know what, Zoe? You
can try to chase me away,

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.393
 but I ain't going nowhere.

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:18.097
 Listen to me, damn it!

01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:20.567
 Brina, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, okay?

01:37:20.569 --> 01:37:21.467
 I really do.

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:26.406
 Oh!

01:37:26.408 --> 01:37:28.141
 You did not just turn that television
back on while I was talking to you!

01:37:29.543 --> 01:37:31.578
 Okay.

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:34.414
 If that's how it's gonna be,

01:37:34.416 --> 01:37:36.082
 then we will just watch TV.

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:39.085
 But I ain't going nowhere.

01:37:42.156 --> 01:37:44.390
<i> ...and you're going to
have to make 250 portions.</i>

01:37:44.392 --> 01:37:46.092
<i> And then you</i> <i> think
you're a chef, right?</i>

01:37:46.094 --> 01:37:47.927
<i> Well, I do hope so.</i>

01:37:47.929 --> 01:37:49.963
 Grandma! Grandma!

01:37:49.965 --> 01:37:51.364
 Can I get a hug? Hello?

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.068
 Bye, babe. Mmm.

01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:56.469
 See you.

01:37:58.139 --> 01:38:00.940
Silly banana... All
right, go ahead.

01:38:00.942 --> 01:38:02.609
Bye, Dad. What do we do first?

01:38:02.611 --> 01:38:05.078
Wash our hands and
do our homework.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:06.346
 All right.

01:38:08.415 --> 01:38:11.184
 How you doing? I'm good.

01:38:11.186 --> 01:38:14.020
 But you're not.

01:38:14.022 --> 01:38:16.422
 You know, the kids think we go
to the hotel to let Mommy rest.

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:23.229
 I don't know how to tell
them that we're apart.

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:24.364
 She loves you.

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:27.233
 She messed up.

01:38:27.235 --> 01:38:29.569
But she needs you
now, more than ever.

01:38:29.571 --> 01:38:32.672
 And if I can forgive
her, so can you.

01:38:32.674 --> 01:38:34.207
 What about your wedding vows?

01:38:36.143 --> 01:38:37.677
 "In sickness and in health."

01:38:37.679 --> 01:38:39.379
 Those weren't just
words, were they?

01:38:39.381 --> 01:38:41.147
 Yeah, what about honesty
and faithfulness?

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:43.483
 It's a sickness.

01:38:46.655 --> 01:38:49.155
 Well, I have trouble
understanding that.

01:38:49.157 --> 01:38:51.658
 You two built this house
and this family together.

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:53.559
 And just because it doesn't
fit into a perfect package,

01:38:53.561 --> 01:38:56.062
 are you willing to
throw all that away?

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.069
 Here.

01:40:03.497 --> 01:40:04.697
 Thank you, sweetheart.

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.570
 Welcome, everyone.

01:40:10.572 --> 01:40:12.305
 Hi.

01:40:12.307 --> 01:40:14.273
 Looks like we
have a new member.

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:18.544
 Would you like to stand
up and introduce yourself?

01:40:24.618 --> 01:40:26.119
- Hi, I'm Zoe.
- Hi.

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.188
 And I am a sex addict.

01:40:33.027 --> 01:40:36.262
 When I was 10 years old, I
was raped by three boys.

01:40:39.333 --> 01:40:43.703
 Uh, I buried that
memory far, far away

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:48.141
 until someone I know

01:40:48.143 --> 01:40:50.710
 reminded me exactly
why I had to remember.

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:53.679
 It ruined my life.

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:59.552
 It, uh, destroyed my family.

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:04.657
 I, uh, would lie and cheat

01:41:04.659 --> 01:41:07.293
 and do whatever I
could to get that fix.

01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:13.733
 I love my husband.

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:24.744
I know it's hard for
him to believe that,

01:41:24.746 --> 01:41:26.079
 but I do.

01:41:28.348 --> 01:41:29.582
 I miss my friend.

01:41:31.852 --> 01:41:34.587
 I miss my best friend,
and I know that

01:41:37.391 --> 01:41:39.725
 with help from the one
person that I hurt the most,

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.330
 I can get better.

01:42:09.223 --> 01:42:10.590
 Our love is forever.

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:14.293
 Always has been.

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:17.630
 Always will be.
