WEBVTT

00:02.307 --> 00:04.134
I missed you so much.

00:05.101 --> 00:07.859
You know I set my vehicle
navigation to French?

00:07.859 --> 00:09.264
I kept getting lost.

00:09.668 --> 00:11.176
What, your boyfriend couldn't help you?

00:11.176 --> 00:14.436
Oh, stop it. Come on. You
know I was on the rebound.

00:14.469 --> 00:16.513
Besides I thought I was
never gonna see you again.

00:16.513 --> 00:17.587
I texted you.

00:17.587 --> 00:21.897
- All you had to do was text back.
- I know. I know. I am sorry.

00:22.697 --> 00:26.069
I should have listened to my heart.

00:26.102 --> 00:29.302
Well, it was fate that
brought us back together.

00:29.336 --> 00:32.852
Mm. Of all the galleries in all
the towns in all the world...

00:33.358 --> 00:36.738
- I had to walk into yours.
- "Casablanca."

00:41.898 --> 00:43.668
Do you think we're gonna work this time?

00:43.702 --> 00:46.302
- I know we will.
- Yeah?

00:47.935 --> 00:49.903
How long have we got
before your visa runs out?

00:49.903 --> 00:52.802
Six months? A year?

00:52.835 --> 00:54.802
Let's not talk about that.

00:54.835 --> 00:56.202
Oh, come on.

00:56.236 --> 01:00.069
God, being with you... it's
a constant leap of faith.

01:00.102 --> 01:03.136
You know, nothing is
certain in this world, Sarah.

01:03.169 --> 01:05.603
All we have is faith.

01:05.635 --> 01:08.503
You know I'm an agnostic.

01:16.871 --> 01:18.064
I'm going to the gym.

01:18.309 --> 01:20.015
Hey. You're going to the gym again?

01:20.817 --> 01:22.211
Soon you can bench-press me.

01:22.761 --> 01:24.511
Don't panic. I'm just doing cardio.

01:25.711 --> 01:27.635
All right. So I'll just meet you
at my mom's for dinner, right?

01:28.266 --> 01:30.457
Oh, no. I... I... I told your
mom. I... I didn't tell you.

01:30.600 --> 01:31.887
I'm gonna have dinner with my dad tonight.

01:32.688 --> 01:33.543
Oh, well, m... maybe you can switch it,

01:33.694 --> 01:35.336
because my mom's doing
that big dinner for Luc.

01:35.505 --> 01:37.206
- He just got back.
- I know, but s... so did my dad.

01:37.445 --> 01:38.816
So why don't we have
dinner at my mom's tonight,

01:38.967 --> 01:39.861
and we'll have dinner
at your dad's tomorrow?

01:39.977 --> 01:41.133
That way we can, uh, stay together.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.156
Well, th... the thing
is, he's free tonight.

01:42.156 --> 01:43.705
And honestly, you know,
I think it'd be good

01:43.705 --> 01:46.097
to hang out with him by
myself for a little while.

01:46.567 --> 01:49.976
Okay. Are you...

01:52.915 --> 01:54.116
Yeah, I'm sure we'll
talk about lots of things.

01:54.116 --> 01:55.248
I haven't seen him in weeks.

01:55.424 --> 01:56.653
Oh. Good. Well, I... I... you know...

01:57.931 --> 02:00.451
What, spent the entire dinner
talking about my miscarriage?

02:00.451 --> 02:02.578
Justin, these things happen all the time.

02:02.692 --> 02:03.608
Okay, Rebecca, not to us.

02:03.939 --> 02:04.985
All right? It's never happened to us,

02:05.078 --> 02:06.329
and every time I try
and talk to you about it,

02:06.421 --> 02:08.151
- you're running out the door.
- 'Cause I'd rather be at the gym.

02:08.269 --> 02:10.830
I'd rather be having dinner
with my dad, laughing.

02:11.049 --> 02:13.994
- I mean, wh... why can't you understand that?
- I do. I do. I just...

02:14.854 --> 02:17.328
I want to make sure you're
dealing with it, all right?

02:18.390 --> 02:20.633
Justin, I know you go to your NA meetings

02:20.836 --> 02:22.788
and you talk about everything,
and I think that's great.

02:23.453 --> 02:24.821
But I'm fine. I'm good, okay?

02:24.821 --> 02:27.212
So just let me move on, please.

02:29.475 --> 02:30.748
- Okay.
- Okay.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.772
All right.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.947 --> 02:43.104
She's got us running around town

02:43.263 --> 02:44.725
like the election is... is next Tuesday.

02:44.927 --> 02:47.575
I mean, I'm really starting to
think that Buffy doesn't sleep.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.652
- Buffy?
- Buffy McCreary... you know, my... my campaign manager.

02:51.806 --> 02:52.876
I mean, how many Buffys do you know?

02:53.065 --> 02:55.071
You'd be surprised. What's the problem?

02:55.260 --> 02:58.138
The problem is, w... we're friends,
and so every time I tell her...

02:58.286 --> 02:59.614
That she's bugging the crap out of me...

02:59.756 --> 03:01.818
She... she just thinks I'm kidding.

03:02.093 --> 03:03.599
Ugh. Well, she's just doing her job.

03:03.836 --> 03:04.890
You hired her to get you out there.

03:04.890 --> 03:07.142
Yeah, well, believe me, I'm
out there. I'm everywhere.

03:07.962 --> 03:09.058
Do you know where I have to go tomorrow?

03:09.215 --> 03:11.248
I have to go to a gun club in Glendale.

03:11.380 --> 03:12.143
Well, at least you don't have to go

03:12.143 --> 03:13.752
to the Walt Disney
concert hall with Robert

03:13.878 --> 03:16.768
to watch a rehearsal of Ravel's
"concerto for the left hand."

03:17.701 --> 03:20.985
- That sounds like a date.
- Yes, it is. You know what?

03:21.121 --> 03:22.959
Yesterday he made me go
with him to Astroburger

03:22.959 --> 03:24.861
and split a Turkey burger and real burger

03:24.984 --> 03:26.967
so we could be "heart smart" together.

03:27.132 --> 03:29.111
Did you guys do the "two
straw, one milk shake" thing?

03:29.203 --> 03:30.950
It's not funny! He's become clingy,

03:30.950 --> 03:33.131
and it's freaking me out.
It's like we're BFFs suddenly.

03:33.131 --> 03:34.930
I mean, come on. You've
gotta give Robert a break.

03:35.066 --> 03:36.032
His term is winding down,

03:36.032 --> 03:37.839
and he's not as busy as he used to be,

03:37.839 --> 03:39.319
and he doesn't know
what to do with himself.

03:39.319 --> 03:41.231
Well, what am I supposed
to do with myself?

03:41.231 --> 03:43.439
A... are you telling me
that you want to quit now?

03:43.439 --> 03:46.036
- Oh, I... because if you do you, you...
- Telling a US Senator

03:46.200 --> 03:49.464
that you want to date
other people... is not easy.

03:49.464 --> 03:52.245
Come on. Robert is a big
boy. He's gonna be fine.

03:52.386 --> 03:53.852
He will handle it. It...
you know, the truth is,

03:53.971 --> 03:55.965
I'm actually more worried about you.

03:56.454 --> 03:58.785
I mean, Robert's not the
only one who's losing his BFF.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.616
Breaking up is hard to do.

04:05.665 --> 04:07.354
Holly tells me that you're
gonna see her tomorrow.

04:07.354 --> 04:08.959
Yes. Yes, I am.

04:10.357 --> 04:12.274
I can't believe Dennis
York is back in our lives

04:12.778 --> 04:15.315
and Holly almost sold him
her shares of Ojai Foods.

04:15.694 --> 04:17.286
I know, but she didn't sell it, Nora.

04:17.416 --> 04:18.899
Ojai is ours. That's what's important.

04:19.128 --> 04:21.094
I'm just afraid. When
Dennis York wants something,

04:21.233 --> 04:22.365
he always finds a way of getting it.

04:22.616 --> 04:23.418
Well, he's not gonna get it this time.

04:23.553 --> 04:27.405
- He tried and he failed.
- Saul, listen. What if Holly's right?

04:27.606 --> 04:29.793
What if there is something
hidden in the company,

04:29.923 --> 04:32.819
something of value, and...
and he knows about it?

04:32.933 --> 04:33.732
If that's true,

04:33.929 --> 04:36.429
then Dennis is never gonna
go away until he gets it.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.286
- Mom, where are you?
- Uh, just a second.

04:40.450 --> 04:43.077
Remember, we're not telling
the kids any of this.

04:43.223 --> 04:43.793
As far as they know,

04:43.937 --> 04:46.587
it's just some random
buyer who approached Holly.

04:46.702 --> 04:48.145
Would any of them even remember his name?

04:48.296 --> 04:50.711
God, why couldn't he just take
"no" for an answer and go away?

04:52.088 --> 04:52.626
Hey, hello.

04:55.215 --> 04:58.474
Well, I... I thought the French liked
to take a lot of time when they eat.

04:58.656 --> 05:01.157
They do, between courses.
We haven't even started.

05:01.309 --> 05:04.644
- All right. Coming, coming!
- Oh, come on. Get it out there.

05:06.195 --> 05:08.359
- What's up with her?
- She's just excited to see Luc. That's all.

05:08.467 --> 05:09.644
- I'm very happy for you, too.
- Okay,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.129
well, just calm down.
Let's see how it goes.

05:12.255 --> 05:13.231
Oui. Absolument.

05:13.584 --> 05:15.752
"Mais un coeur clos est lourd à porter."

05:15.869 --> 05:18.981
Ohh. Sorry. I was trying to
get the poached eggs just right.

05:19.182 --> 05:20.482
- Salade frisée?
- Yes.

05:20.652 --> 05:22.515
- Je t'aime, Nora.
- Oh, je t'aime, aussi.

05:22.899 --> 05:25.716
Well, excuse me. I thought
he came back for me.

05:25.845 --> 05:27.638
Oh, no. He came back for
all of us. Right, Luc?

05:27.791 --> 05:29.253
Yeah, our dance steps have gotten Rusty.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.305
That's right. How was the wedding?

05:30.453 --> 05:32.926
- I have so much to catch up on.
- Wedding didn't happen.

05:33.121 --> 05:34.517
Twice. The first time,
because of a hurricane.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.032
Yeah, then Kitty fainted on the beach.

05:36.184 --> 05:37.308
So basically, don't ask,

05:37.430 --> 05:38.929
- 'cause we'll be here all night.
- But everybody's fine now.

05:39.179 --> 05:41.212
Well, good, 'cause
I... can't even tell you

05:41.334 --> 05:42.913
how happy I am to see everyone.

05:45.793 --> 05:47.000
Hey, what are you, uh,
what are you doing Saturday?

05:47.158 --> 05:49.186
- We never got you on the, uh, surfboard.
- That's right.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.566
You were going to teach
me how to shoot some pipe

05:50.720 --> 05:53.957
- and get totally hell-munched.
- Yeah! That's my boy.

05:54.192 --> 05:55.330
- Hell-munched? - Oh, w...
no, wait. Wait a minute.

05:55.450 --> 05:57.868
Kevin and Scotty and I are taking Luc

05:58.015 --> 05:59.261
to the Huntington Gardens on Saturday.

05:59.378 --> 06:00.774
- What?
- But you're invited, Sarah.

06:00.908 --> 06:02.020
Oh, gee, thanks, mom.

06:04.666 --> 06:06.000
- That's right. The movie.
- Yes.

06:06.249 --> 06:09.017
I... I got tickets to the
Jean Renoir retrospective.

06:09.017 --> 06:10.594
I think I overbooked myself.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.863
We knew how long we were
gonna have you for, right?

06:14.707 --> 06:16.827
Uh, is there still a
problem with your visa?

06:16.827 --> 06:20.110
Yes, um, my tourist visa is running out.

06:20.730 --> 06:21.953
Kevin made some phone calls for me,

06:22.131 --> 06:23.406
but... but he's been in
and out of the country

06:23.532 --> 06:25.485
so many times now, at this
point, they won't renew it.

06:25.644 --> 06:27.371
- Why don't you guys just get hitched?
- Hitched?

06:27.524 --> 06:28.309
What? It would make him a citizen.

06:28.446 --> 06:29.517
It's, like, a no-brainer, right?

06:29.662 --> 06:31.106
Justin, it's also a very big step.

06:31.249 --> 06:31.937
Yeah, but you know you love him.

06:32.073 --> 06:32.812
Oh, come on. Get married.

06:32.997 --> 06:35.899
Come on,stop it. No,
we're not getting married.

06:36.055 --> 06:37.716
I know you would like us to marry

06:37.892 --> 06:39.679
so that you could spend
endless time together.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.307
Now, everybody, just stop.

06:41.496 --> 06:42.790
They're not ready to
talk about marriage yet.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.718
Come on. It's just to keep
him in the country. That's all.

06:44.855 --> 06:46.649
You know what? Justin,
why don't you marry him?

06:47.189 --> 06:48.192
I'm engaged or I would.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.967
- Oh, Saul, Saul, you could marry him.
- Yeah, I could marry him.

06:51.192 --> 06:52.027
Except, thanks to our state government,

06:52.027 --> 06:53.285
we no longer have that right.

06:53.782 --> 06:55.680
Look, there's probably a
thousand women in this city

06:55.837 --> 06:58.143
- that would marry Luc in a heartbeat...
- God knows, I'm available.

06:59.296 --> 07:00.585
Like my mom. All right, seriously,

07:00.766 --> 07:01.975
you can get married for a green card.

07:02.133 --> 07:02.923
People do it all the time.

07:03.061 --> 07:05.420
Actually my... my art dealer
has been offering to marry me

07:05.550 --> 07:06.752
- for years now.
- Who? Ginny?

07:07.019 --> 07:11.420
- Yeah. Yeah. As a business arrangement.
- You never told me that.

07:15.072 --> 07:17.137
No, Luc, you're not... you're
not really gonna do that?

07:18.052 --> 07:20.034
Come on. It would just be a
piece of paper, that's all.

07:20.276 --> 07:22.514
Sarah, put a stop to this right now.

07:22.947 --> 07:25.418
Well, if it's between that and him
being shipped back to Bordeaux...

07:25.869 --> 07:27.212
Well, are you considering this?

07:27.441 --> 07:29.531
Well, he... doesn't have that much time.

07:29.803 --> 07:31.148
Wait a second. How long do you have?

07:32.559 --> 07:34.947
Uh, I don't know. He...
he won't talk about it.

07:35.103 --> 07:37.477
How long is it, Luc? Six months or...

07:38.327 --> 07:40.769
Um... actually four weeks.

07:41.159 --> 07:43.541
No, y... you mean months.
A week has seven days.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.306
Yeah. I'm... I'm sorry.
I didn't want to worry you.

07:47.943 --> 07:50.738
I was hoping to, uh, fix this on my own.

07:53.595 --> 07:54.698
Oh, my God.

07:56.648 --> 07:57.623
Well, don't worry, honey. Don't worry.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.778
We're not gonna let Luc go
without a great big fight.

08:02.972 --> 08:04.553
I'm sorry, Sarah.

08:15.050 --> 08:16.987
All right. You'll pop
off a couple dozen rounds,

08:17.249 --> 08:19.342
show these folks you're handy with that 9,

08:19.375 --> 08:21.218
and then we'll mosey on
down to the clubhouse...

08:21.793 --> 08:22.847
And drop that speech on 'em, 'kay?

08:22.984 --> 08:25.512
Can you please stop talking
like you're on "hee haw"?

08:27.522 --> 08:29.300
Don't be shy. Who wants a
shot of Annie Oakley here?

08:32.143 --> 08:34.909
That's nice. Now smile.

08:34.942 --> 08:38.308
There we go. All right.
Okay, that's good. Back up.

08:38.342 --> 08:40.155
Back up, back up, back up,
back up. Give her some space.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.285
Hey, did you get those changes in
the speech I sent you yesterday?

08:42.582 --> 08:44.595
Oh, dag, gone it, anyway.
You know what I did?

08:44.737 --> 08:46.202
I gone and left it down on the homestead.

08:47.857 --> 08:49.427
Kitty Walker, you just
don't want to do my changes.

08:49.427 --> 08:50.316
You're right,

08:50.503 --> 08:53.855
because I actually do support a
firearm ban on California convicts.

08:53.990 --> 08:56.703
Hey,you utter the word
"ban" in front of this crowd,

08:56.825 --> 08:58.490
and they're gonna be shooting
more than just photographs.

08:59.866 --> 09:01.479
- Oh, my God!
- What... what, did you get shot?

09:01.693 --> 09:05.447
Your shoes. What happened
to the pumps we agreed on?

09:05.736 --> 09:09.163
Oh, my God. This is a gun club.

09:09.306 --> 09:10.731
I am not about to wear high heels.

09:10.918 --> 09:12.608
Well, they looked so cute,

09:12.831 --> 09:14.784
and, quite frankly, you
could use the height.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.347
And since when don't you
listen to my fashion advice?

09:17.550 --> 09:19.332
Since we're not in our 20-somethings.

09:19.549 --> 09:22.738
Okay? Now... now listen to me.
I am running for Senate now.

09:22.871 --> 09:24.720
We are not trolling
Georgetown looking for bars.

09:25.540 --> 09:26.694
Okay? I want the voters to know

09:26.845 --> 09:29.208
that I can make really tough decisions,

09:29.420 --> 09:30.688
like what I put on my feet.

09:32.499 --> 09:33.845
Okay, well, Kitty...

09:34.623 --> 09:37.271
I'm gonna have an opinion
about what's on your feet

09:37.419 --> 09:39.042
and what's on your head
and everything in between.

09:39.220 --> 09:39.791
It's my job.

09:39.791 --> 09:42.279
You don't happen to have a
photo of yourself, do you?

09:42.623 --> 09:45.088
- On me? No, why?
- No reason.

09:49.822 --> 09:50.819
Bull's-eye.

09:51.273 --> 09:52.311
You think Kitty shot Buffy yet?

09:53.071 --> 09:54.846
Not yet, but I give that
marriage less than a month.

09:56.738 --> 09:57.785
Robert, do you think we could talk?

09:59.114 --> 09:59.735
About what?

09:59.982 --> 10:03.798
W... w... well, it's just, um... me.

10:04.019 --> 10:05.330
I... you know, it's just...

10:05.467 --> 10:07.506
- I'm trying to figure things out...
- It's okay. I get it.

10:08.519 --> 10:10.666
- You do?
- Well, yeah. I'm not running for Governor.

10:10.825 --> 10:11.705
I've given up the Senate seat.

10:12.809 --> 10:13.797
Things seem a little up in the air,

10:13.930 --> 10:15.123
- and you're wondering how you fit in.
- Well,

10:15.253 --> 10:17.824
actually I thought maybe
now was the time, you know...

10:19.670 --> 10:20.670
do you remember the meeting I took

10:20.942 --> 10:22.775
with the institute for Republican thought?

10:24.545 --> 10:27.252
It doesn't exist. It was about a job.

10:28.150 --> 10:30.903
- What kind of job?
- I can't talk about it.

10:31.868 --> 10:34.188
Wh... what, am I supposed
to play 20 questions now?

10:34.385 --> 10:37.010
Suffice it to say, it's an opportunity

10:37.139 --> 10:39.175
that I've been looking
for for a long time,

10:39.329 --> 10:41.568
and most guys, I mean, they
don't even get the call.

10:41.903 --> 10:43.239
All right, Bruce Wayne.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.062
Does the job come with a cape and a mask?

10:45.326 --> 10:48.603
This job is... big. And if it happens,

10:48.780 --> 10:50.212
there's gonna be a place
at the table for you.

10:51.675 --> 10:53.088
Robert, you have to
give me more than that.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.791
Look, I... I just want you
to know that I depend on you.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.021
I mean, we're a team.

10:59.775 --> 11:00.880
You're just gonna have
to trust me on that.

11:07.227 --> 11:10.935
What about this trip to Montreal
that William took in 1976?

11:11.220 --> 11:12.314
Do you know anything about that?

11:13.630 --> 11:16.472
Yes, I do. I was there.
It was the summer Olympics,

11:16.643 --> 11:18.952
and I spent the entire
time trying to figure out

11:19.142 --> 11:22.421
William's fascination for the pentathlon.

11:22.783 --> 11:23.377
Oh, God.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.092
Do you remember William's running phase?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.705
Ah, yes. He would get so cranky

11:27.947 --> 11:30.646
if he didn't get his 7 miles in every day.

11:31.138 --> 11:33.258
He would run from your house to my house

11:33.428 --> 11:36.403
in one of those hideous neon tracksuits.

11:38.495 --> 11:41.166
No offense, Holly, but
I really don't think

11:41.315 --> 11:44.413
William's old tracksuits are
the key to saving this company.

11:44.630 --> 11:45.367
O... okay, I'm sorry.

11:45.537 --> 11:47.423
I didn't mean to say
something... say anything that...

11:47.561 --> 11:49.053
No. It's fine. It's fine. I'm over it.

11:49.244 --> 11:52.503
This treasure hunt is a
big old wild-goose chase.

11:53.823 --> 11:56.255
That there was a boatload
of money under this company.

11:56.434 --> 11:58.500
I mean, he was even willing
to make me a partner.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.331
Yeah, well, I'm not convinced.

12:01.591 --> 12:02.702
Dennis wanted Ojai.

12:02.827 --> 12:05.072
I think he would've said
practically anything to get it.

12:06.692 --> 12:07.755
Well, how well did you know him?

12:09.688 --> 12:12.906
I... didn't know him very well.

12:13.095 --> 12:14.678
He worked with William, that's all.

12:15.036 --> 12:17.205
William screwed him over,
and Dennis went to prison,

12:17.460 --> 12:19.407
and it was all a very long time ago.

12:20.055 --> 12:21.783
- But if you can remember anything that might help...
- Well,

12:21.965 --> 12:23.508
I don't. I don't remember anything.

12:23.757 --> 12:24.567
I don't remember anything,

12:24.745 --> 12:29.734
- and if I do,I will give you a call.
- Okay.

12:32.771 --> 12:35.012
Holly, uh, you know, I would appreciate it

12:35.147 --> 12:37.097
if you didn't mention
any of this about Dennis

12:37.305 --> 12:40.063
- to the kids just yet.
- Of course.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.025
Hi!

12:50.214 --> 12:50.999
Oh, there.

12:51.526 --> 12:53.955
- Sorry I'm late.
- Remember Ginny, from the gallery?

12:54.131 --> 12:55.856
- Mwah. Yes, of course. Hi.
- Hi.

12:56.006 --> 12:57.434
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.123
Yeah, well, I had to get
Luc to sign some papers

12:59.248 --> 13:00.361
for the art show in Mexico anyway, so...

13:00.559 --> 13:03.521
I am loving the new work he's producing.

13:03.676 --> 13:07.168
He's never been short on
inspiration. On time, maybe.

13:07.672 --> 13:09.764
- Yeah, he said you only have four weeks?
- Yeah.

13:10.009 --> 13:10.983
I guess he told you last night,

13:11.129 --> 13:13.317
I've been offering to marry him for years.

13:13.462 --> 13:15.456
Before Sarah, I never had any good reason.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.245
So does the offer still stand?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.857
Yeah. I mean, if it helps you
guys, I'd be more than happy.

13:21.571 --> 13:25.872
- Wow. Okay, what would it entail?
- Well, it's simple.

13:26.045 --> 13:28.062
We just go down to City
Hall and sign some papers.

13:28.322 --> 13:30.016
You make it sound like you're
getting a fishing license.

13:30.311 --> 13:30.868
Pretty much,

13:31.046 --> 13:33.132
except, in this case, they might
check up on us periodically,

13:33.423 --> 13:35.193
so we just have to make sure
we look like a real couple.

13:35.396 --> 13:38.250
What, do you just take a bunch
of cute snapshots together?

13:38.408 --> 13:39.192
No, no. I... I...

13:39.371 --> 13:42.083
we need, kind of, to live
together for some time.

13:42.908 --> 13:43.859
But we can make it work.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.757
My boyfriend is totally
on board with this.

13:46.312 --> 13:48.774
Oh, y... y... and he doesn't
mind you marrying Luc?

13:48.986 --> 13:51.821
No. I mean, you guys aren't
thinking of one day, you know...

13:51.975 --> 13:54.363
Oh. Uh, no. Uh... Clay and
I, we would never get married.

13:54.502 --> 13:55.603
And, anyway, it's a 3-bedroom,

13:55.785 --> 13:57.691
so this whole arrangement
would be no problem.

13:58.094 --> 14:00.185
Well, you really do sound like
you have thought it through.

14:03.203 --> 14:03.888
We did, yeah.

14:04.836 --> 14:06.702
Look, obviously, you guys need to talk.

14:06.825 --> 14:07.860
Actually, no, I don't think so.

14:08.037 --> 14:09.519
As you said, it's a business arrangement.

14:09.817 --> 14:11.690
- And it makes sense.
- Okay.

14:14.394 --> 14:15.133
That's the thing.

14:15.562 --> 14:18.057
Um, we need to do this
before Ginny goes to Mexico.

14:18.308 --> 14:20.880
Right. We talked about that.
I have to be there for a while,

14:21.081 --> 14:23.338
and I think it might look
a little suspicious...

14:23.802 --> 14:25.791
Luc getting married a couple
days before his visa runs out.

14:25.974 --> 14:29.511
Ah, yes. Good point. So
when do you have to leave?

14:30.361 --> 14:32.522
Well... tomorrow.

14:35.456 --> 14:36.237
Oh.

14:37.430 --> 14:38.800
But that would mean you'd
have to get married...

14:39.525 --> 14:40.182
Today.

14:42.513 --> 14:43.544
That would be soon.

14:43.815 --> 14:45.668
Look, we can talk about
it some more if you want.

14:46.305 --> 14:48.377
No, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:48.714 --> 14:51.651
This afternoon... it's
great. I can't make it.

14:52.102 --> 14:53.472
Um, I've got to get back to work,

14:54.131 --> 14:55.566
but it's not like you
need me there anyway.

14:56.038 --> 14:58.238
- This afternoon it is.
- Okay.

14:59.188 --> 15:02.011
Should we make it official... monsieur?

15:02.509 --> 15:03.422
- Bien sur!
- Okay.

15:05.102 --> 15:05.736
Voila.

15:07.752 --> 15:08.856
Congratulations.

15:15.985 --> 15:17.385
I know the last person in the world

15:17.612 --> 15:18.859
you want to hear about is Dennis York,

15:19.010 --> 15:20.479
but you are giving him too much power.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.725
He can't do anything to hurt us, Nora.

15:25.001 --> 15:26.618
Nora, you're being paranoid. I mean it.

15:26.806 --> 15:28.824
You forget how far back this all goes.

15:29.036 --> 15:31.740
And the person who was
there from the very beginning

15:32.009 --> 15:33.831
- was Dennis York.
- Right. I know.

15:34.009 --> 15:35.324
And I'm sure that Dennis
did things for William

15:35.456 --> 15:36.650
that are best left where they are,

15:36.800 --> 15:39.438
but as you said, that
was a lifetime ago, Nora.

15:39.636 --> 15:41.219
Who would even care about that?

15:41.465 --> 15:43.610
And anyway, he'd only
be implicating himself.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.540
What if he goes after the kids?

15:46.947 --> 15:49.156
What? What... at... what are
you talking about, the kids?

15:49.568 --> 15:52.091
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.
I'm being paranoid.

15:53.093 --> 15:54.791
Saul, would you do me a favor?

15:56.450 --> 15:57.643
Would you find out where he is?

15:58.045 --> 15:59.663
I need to know if he's gone or not.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.349
Of course, sweetheart. Yes,
I will. I'll take care of it.

16:03.096 --> 16:03.867
Just...

16:04.987 --> 16:06.876
Saul, are we gonna have a
chance to go over these...

16:07.891 --> 16:10.421
Why is it that every
time I walk into a room,

16:11.217 --> 16:14.019
you two look like you're having
a very private conversation?

16:14.209 --> 16:15.877
Well, actually, we were
talking about you and Luc.

16:16.823 --> 16:19.346
Yeah, is everything all right?
Have you... have you gotten rid

16:19.605 --> 16:20.967
of that whole ridiculous
green card marriage thing?

16:21.161 --> 16:22.810
Uh... not exactly.

16:25.136 --> 16:26.255
Where's the car, Buffy?

16:26.428 --> 16:27.861
That was Brian. He'll be here any sec.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.884
Oh, my goodness! Look at that.

16:30.221 --> 16:32.631
It's a little gun. "Straight shooter."

16:32.838 --> 16:33.727
Oh, isn't that cute?

16:33.861 --> 16:35.513
If he's late because he went
to go pick up my high heels,

16:35.640 --> 16:36.857
I promise you, I will kill you.

16:36.988 --> 16:38.456
Honey, the heels will be worth it.

16:38.761 --> 16:41.250
Oh, my God. You know what?

16:41.350 --> 16:42.928
We're not gonna have time
to make that yacht club.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.816
- We're gonna have to cancel.
- Are you kiddin'?

16:44.987 --> 16:46.249
Republicans love boats. Plus,

16:46.408 --> 16:48.028
- those people are...
- You know what? I'm the candidate,

16:48.565 --> 16:51.822
and I say we reschedule.
We... we reschedule.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.290
Uh, no can do, little lady.

16:53.568 --> 16:55.533
- Little what?
- Don't start poutin'. I'm just doin' my job.

16:56.763 --> 16:59.599
No. You know what? No, you're
not. You're not anymore.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.190
- You're not. You know what you are? You're fired.
- What?

17:02.356 --> 17:03.809
You're fired, you're fired,
you're fired, you're fired.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.160
- Fired, fired, fired.
- Okay. Hey,

17:05.362 --> 17:07.781
hey. I know you gave up
decaf. Okay, I get it.

17:08.309 --> 17:09.018
Buffy, I'm serious.

17:10.326 --> 17:11.627
Oh, honey, I know you're serious,

17:11.895 --> 17:15.261
and normally I'd act all hurt
and I'd scurry off to the hotel,

17:15.429 --> 17:16.873
and I'd wait for you
to apologize tomorrow,

17:17.113 --> 17:19.795
but frankly, our schedule
doesn't allow us such luxuries.

17:19.923 --> 17:23.502
So why don't we just just chalk
this up as done and behind us,

17:23.627 --> 17:24.650
and move on, 'kay?

17:25.112 --> 17:28.249
No. No, no. Not... not... no. No,
no... not... not... not "okay."

17:28.477 --> 17:29.878
This is... this is the thing. This is...

17:30.120 --> 17:31.109
d... d... do you...
do you see the problem?

17:31.290 --> 17:32.729
Do you see the problem?
You're not listening to me.

17:33.062 --> 17:35.068
I am firing you, and you're
still not listening to me.

17:35.352 --> 17:38.680
Buffy, I mean it. We have to part ways.

17:40.973 --> 17:41.885
No, I can't do it.

17:42.141 --> 17:44.456
It would be disastrous to this campaign.

17:46.163 --> 17:47.711
Okay, here's what I'm gonna
do. I'm gonna take this call...

17:48.000 --> 17:50.347
- Yes.
- And when I turn around, you're gonna be gone.

17:53.689 --> 17:54.394
Hello?

17:54.636 --> 17:56.115
- Kitty, it's us.
- Hi, Kitty.

17:56.718 --> 17:58.432
- Hi.
- Listen, Kitty, we need your help.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.085
- Luc is marrying his art dealer in two hours.
- What?

18:02.336 --> 18:04.784
- For his green card.
- Mom, would you just calm down? Listen, Kitty.

18:05.005 --> 18:06.482
- This is a good thing.
- No, no,

18:06.661 --> 18:07.622
no, no. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Sarah.

18:07.778 --> 18:10.107
There is nothing good
about a green card marriage.

18:10.380 --> 18:11.488
Green card marriage?

18:11.761 --> 18:13.675
All I wanted to do was
discuss the sales projections.

18:13.856 --> 18:15.210
I don't even know why I told you.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.937
L... l... listen, Kitty.
We need you to help us

18:18.085 --> 18:19.413
- figure out what she should do.
- Oh,

18:19.592 --> 18:21.777
is that Sarah? Is she
gonna marry the French guy?

18:22.019 --> 18:22.911
Would you... would you please go away?

18:23.120 --> 18:24.452
You two need to understand my reality.

18:24.652 --> 18:26.107
Luc's visa will run out in four weeks.

18:26.253 --> 18:29.110
But that's four weeks. Honey,
you should tell him to wait.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.561
We'll figure out something
for... for you guys to do.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.054
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- Mom,

18:33.210 --> 18:35.983
I will be hurt if my
boyfriend is deported.

18:36.206 --> 18:38.165
Okay? It's a business transaction.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.415
Sarah, w... why don't you just marry Luc?

18:41.884 --> 18:43.477
Why would you even ask me that?

18:43.824 --> 18:44.912
What is wrong with you people?

18:45.748 --> 18:48.068
Because if I were ever
to marry Luc, it would be

18:48.831 --> 18:51.438
because I would like to spend
the rest of my life with him,

18:51.830 --> 18:54.208
not for a green card. So in the meantime,

18:54.531 --> 18:55.938
he's marrying his art dealer.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.896
- Yes, exactly.
- Do you want to know where we are, Sarah?

18:59.073 --> 19:00.558
We're back at Cranberry Ball. Remember?

19:00.738 --> 19:02.496
- Remember Michael Mizlanski?
- Yeah.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.120
Yeah, well, you were afraid
to ask him to the dance,

19:05.254 --> 19:06.560
so he went ahead and asked somebody else.

19:09.535 --> 19:10.640
- Suzy Lang.
- Yep.

19:10.970 --> 19:12.723
And Suzy and Michael are married now.

19:13.337 --> 19:13.904
Really?

19:14.020 --> 19:17.756
- Hey, could I get an update, please?
- Would you... no. I fired you.

19:20.629 --> 19:21.483
Sarah, listen to me.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.834
Do you love him?

19:24.537 --> 19:28.091
See, why should I even
have to say that out loud?

19:28.308 --> 19:29.896
We've been back together barely a week.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.233
- Sarah, do you love him?
- I don't know. Probably.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.117
- Probably
- Yes. Yes, I love him, okay?

19:38.106 --> 19:41.199
- Sweetheart, that's wonderful.
- No, it's not wonderful, mom,

19:41.350 --> 19:43.253
because life is a lot
more complicated than that.

19:43.395 --> 19:45.143
He knows that I love him.
I told him that I loved him

19:45.296 --> 19:47.183
a long time ago, but
it was still too hard,

19:47.638 --> 19:49.600
and he left me and he went back to France.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.092
Yeah, but he came back.
That's the thing, Sarah.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.443
He's doing all of this for you.

19:57.762 --> 19:59.674
- We've gotta go to City Hall.
- We have to go to City Hall.

19:59.897 --> 20:01.762
- Kitty, meet us there.
- Yeah, yeah. No, no, I can. I can.

20:01.906 --> 20:03.106
- Kitty, meet us at City Hall
-  I'm on my way. I'll be there.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.824
- I'll be there. As soon as I get my car.
- What's going on?

20:04.969 --> 20:07.146
I have a wedding to stop. I need my car,

20:07.320 --> 20:09.479
- Buffy.
- Uh, this is me getting your car. Hello?

20:09.644 --> 20:11.595
- Buffy... hurry up.
- Yes, Brian, we need it now.

20:14.497 --> 20:15.831
Hey, world traveler.

20:16.043 --> 20:17.365
- Hi.
- Hey, welcome back.

20:17.625 --> 20:18.997
Thanks. Is Rebecca here?

20:19.520 --> 20:22.252
Uh, Rebecca is not here.
No. Just, uh, just me.

20:23.365 --> 20:24.575
Oh. I just wanted to check in.

20:25.962 --> 20:27.047
I'm sorry about the miscarriage.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.635
You doing okay?

20:29.868 --> 20:30.930
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess.

20:31.051 --> 20:32.404
You know, it was a... it was a tough week.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.256
How's Rebecca doing?

20:35.349 --> 20:37.088
Um, I don't know. You know, every time

20:37.199 --> 20:38.954
I try and talk to her,
she's out the door, so...

20:39.109 --> 20:40.254
You would probably know better than I do.

20:40.591 --> 20:42.360
No. She's not answering her cell phone,

20:42.564 --> 20:44.848
so everything I hear is pretty
much secondhand from Holly.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.389
That's why I was hoping to see her today.

20:48.761 --> 20:51.037
Wait. Uh, didn't... didn't you
have dinner with her last night?

20:52.011 --> 20:54.490
Last night? No, I just
came here from the airport.

20:54.646 --> 20:55.620
My stuff's still in the car.

20:58.783 --> 20:59.382
What's going on?

21:01.105 --> 21:01.797
I don't know.

21:01.988 --> 21:03.891
I... last night she said she
was having dinner with you.

21:04.073 --> 21:06.333
That's not true. Look,
do you know where she is?

21:10.435 --> 21:11.553
No.

21:14.717 --> 21:15.674
No.

21:18.869 --> 21:19.683
Kevin?

21:20.639 --> 21:21.376
Yeah.

21:21.676 --> 21:23.332
- Do you have my memo for the committee?
- Nope.

21:24.405 --> 21:25.170
What have you been doing?

21:27.638 --> 21:28.499
Something big.

21:29.343 --> 21:30.322
Oh, I updated your web page.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.178
I thought "Robert
McCallister, US Senator" was

21:33.335 --> 21:36.256
a little too specific, so now
it just says "Robert, a man."

21:37.039 --> 21:38.490
I don't think the
Californians who support you

21:38.660 --> 21:40.856
should know too much about
exactly what it is you do. Kevin.

21:41.004 --> 21:41.841
Runners-up did include

21:41.959 --> 21:43.303
"Robert McCallister,
national man of mystery"

21:43.496 --> 21:46.029
and "McCallister...
don't ask, he won't tell."

21:46.161 --> 21:46.969
All right, all right. Shut the door.

21:47.145 --> 21:48.844
Should we go down to the bat cave?

21:53.053 --> 21:56.733
I told you, I'll tell you about
this job when I can talk about it.

21:56.879 --> 21:58.119
So what am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

21:58.231 --> 21:59.819
- Your job.
- Robert, I feel trapped.

22:00.250 --> 22:02.806
- Trapped?
- Yes. And this whole best buddy routine...

22:02.982 --> 22:04.480
it does not make things any easier.

22:04.967 --> 22:06.027
Do you want to go to couples therapy?

22:06.654 --> 22:09.044
No, I do not. I would like
you to take this seriously.

22:09.267 --> 22:10.643
Then maybe you should
be a little more direct.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.407
I want to move on.

22:17.365 --> 22:19.460
And I'm sorry. It doesn't
matter what this new job is.

22:19.618 --> 22:21.116
It... it doesn't matter what it is.

22:21.268 --> 22:22.819
It would be your dream and not mine.

22:27.256 --> 22:28.328
I accept your resignation.

22:29.121 --> 22:29.677
Excuse me?

22:30.146 --> 22:32.347
Well, I mean, isn't that what
you're saying? You wanna go? Go.

22:32.828 --> 22:34.742
I mean, I... I'm just unhappy
to hear that you're so miserable.

22:35.582 --> 22:36.995
Okay, but if you want your freedom,

22:37.134 --> 22:39.282
you should... you should
have it, I mean, by all means.

22:39.432 --> 22:42.852
- I wish you nothing but the best.
- Fine. Two weeks notice okay?

22:43.788 --> 22:45.412
Don't worry about it.
Consider today your last day.

22:46.660 --> 22:47.494
Okay.

22:48.009 --> 22:50.034
Here are your talking points.
So I'd go easy on Espinoza.

22:50.296 --> 22:51.531
I hear he's about to
lose the finance chair,

22:51.702 --> 22:54.664
- so he might be a little sensitive on spending.
- Oh, Kevin?

22:54.928 --> 22:58.395
Yeah. Write out your letter of
resignation, make it official.

23:00.103 --> 23:00.832
Fine.

23:01.611 --> 23:02.534
Good.

23:17.030 --> 23:17.756
Holly.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.023
Listen, I'm wondering if you've
heard any more about York.

23:21.510 --> 23:23.200
No, he hasn't contacted me,

23:23.615 --> 23:26.340
- but I can't stop thinking about him.
- What do you mean?

23:26.513 --> 23:29.614
Well, I finally realized that
I was doing this all wrong.

23:29.892 --> 23:32.959
I've spent all this time going
over all the files of Ojai

23:33.110 --> 23:35.519
when I should have
been investigating York.

23:38.290 --> 23:39.733
Look at this.

23:41.736 --> 23:44.226
- "Narrow Lake Development Group."
- Two weeks ago,

23:44.396 --> 23:46.619
when he thought that I was
gonna sell him my shares,

23:46.737 --> 23:49.414
he filed for a DBA under that name.

23:49.587 --> 23:51.232
Right. So what does that mean?

23:51.484 --> 23:55.348
I found this bill from 1973...

23:55.506 --> 23:56.683
a geological survey

23:56.897 --> 23:59.349
William was doing on
several parcels of land,

23:59.552 --> 24:00.887
including one named...

24:01.178 --> 24:02.659
"Narrow lake."

24:03.035 --> 24:04.523
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- No.

24:04.683 --> 24:08.323
York wanted Ojai so he
could get Narrow Lake.

24:09.178 --> 24:12.896
- So this is it?
- Now all we need to know is where it is.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.894
I mean, it's not mentioned in
any of the other Ojai files,

24:16.017 --> 24:18.292
just this survey for $500.

24:18.537 --> 24:21.557
I don't know. It's as if
the purchase was covered up.

24:21.810 --> 24:23.032
Right. Okay, so William

24:23.237 --> 24:24.987
looked at a lot of land
in those days. Right.

24:25.102 --> 24:27.480
He must have surveyed
thousands of acres...

24:27.658 --> 24:29.373
and some of them weren't
even in California.

24:29.543 --> 24:32.673
- Well, then we have our work cut out for us.
- Right.

24:32.893 --> 24:35.602
But at least we know we're
not kidding ourselves.

24:35.758 --> 24:37.236
At least we know what we're looking for.

24:37.501 --> 24:41.461
At last, I feel that we are
getting ahead of Dennis York.

24:41.704 --> 24:42.949
Oh, I can't wait to tell Nora.

24:44.225 --> 24:46.047
Listen, let me tell her, okay?
I'm gonna see her tonight.

24:47.111 --> 24:47.691
Okay.

24:48.504 --> 24:49.606
She's gonna be really excited.

24:58.627 --> 24:59.434
Hey.

25:00.437 --> 25:02.319
Don't let me interrupt.
I'm just grabbing a snack.

25:04.245 --> 25:05.479
Rebecca, what's going on?

25:07.257 --> 25:09.924
- What do you mean?
- Your father stopped by.

25:09.958 --> 25:13.591
He just got in this morning.

25:14.898 --> 25:16.279
You're unbelievable.

25:16.279 --> 25:18.912
- Where were you last night?
- Last I checked,

25:18.945 --> 25:20.867
I didn't need to ask permission
to leave the apartment.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.331
Rebecca, where have you been going?

25:22.365 --> 25:24.720
All right, I... I just want
to find out what's going on.

25:24.721 --> 25:26.231
Justin, nothing has been going on.

25:26.265 --> 25:29.231
I'm sorry if I wasn't raised in
a family of brothers and sisters

25:29.265 --> 25:31.298
who blab about their
feelings all the time.

25:31.331 --> 25:32.651
I don't even think that's healthy.

25:32.651 --> 25:34.030
I think that when something bad happens,

25:34.030 --> 25:35.049
you get up and you get moving,

25:35.049 --> 25:36.974
- and that's what I'm doing.
- Yeah, but where are you going?

25:36.974 --> 25:40.607
- That's what I'm asking you!
- I'm having dance class!

25:42.802 --> 25:44.768
You haven't... you haven't been dancing

25:44.802 --> 25:47.396
- since you were 15 years old.
- Yeah, well...

25:47.396 --> 25:49.266
You want to know where I'm going?

25:49.266 --> 25:51.682
I'm going to 6th and
Fairfax, if you must know.

25:51.682 --> 25:53.849
I'll be there every night until I'm not.

25:59.615 --> 26:01.648
Kevin, you have to help me.

26:01.682 --> 26:04.376
Well, I don't know what it
is you think I can do, Buffy.

26:04.376 --> 26:05.423
Talk to Kitty.

26:05.423 --> 26:08.090
I mean, how am I supposed to do
my job if she keeps firing me?

26:08.090 --> 26:12.057
I don't think she wants you
to do your job. That's...

26:12.090 --> 26:14.110
I'm on the phone with
Kitty. She's at City Hall.

26:14.111 --> 26:16.257
Good lord. Tell me they
haven't gotten married yet.

26:16.290 --> 26:18.624
- Is that Buffy?
- Yes, it is.

26:18.657 --> 26:20.764
Oh, my God. What do I have
to do to get rid of her?

26:20.764 --> 26:21.808
We have to find a map.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.074
Oh, God. He's still not
answering his phone, mom.

26:24.107 --> 26:26.146
- This is political suicide.
- Listen, I agree with her.

26:26.146 --> 26:27.470
W... well, yes, Robert, of course.

26:27.470 --> 26:28.287
That's what we're doing here.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.821
- We're trying to
stop him. - 10-45.

26:30.854 --> 26:33.055
10-45. Okay, we're going
through the x-ray machine.

26:33.087 --> 26:35.487
- I... I gotta go. I gotta go.
-What in the world?

26:35.521 --> 26:39.554
What are you still doing here?

26:39.588 --> 26:43.354
I'm packing. I'll be gone
by the end of the day.

26:43.387 --> 26:45.854
Well, take everything.

26:45.888 --> 26:48.721
I'm gonna need this
office for the next guy.

26:54.421 --> 26:55.909
Are you crying?

26:55.909 --> 26:58.921
You guys love each
other. Don't you get it?

26:58.955 --> 27:01.521
Would you pull yourself
together? It's embarrassing.

27:09.788 --> 27:12.955
- What is taking so long?
- Seriously, do they really think

27:12.988 --> 27:14.829
this little old lady is
gonna blow up the building?

27:14.829 --> 27:16.428
Maybe it's a sign. Maybe it's a sign

27:16.428 --> 27:18.274
that Ginny and Luc are
supposed to get married.

27:18.275 --> 27:18.994
- Just stop. All right?
- Stop.

27:18.994 --> 27:19.834
- Oh, that's ridiculous, Sarah.
- All right. Well...

27:19.834 --> 27:22.848
Uh, pardon me, ma'am. Could
we go, uh, ahead of you?

27:22.848 --> 27:25.816
We're in an awful hurry,
and my daughter has to stop

27:25.848 --> 27:28.218
a... a wedding that's gonna
happen in... in minutes here.

27:28.218 --> 27:30.303
I'd rather not get involved.

27:30.303 --> 27:32.169
Oh, no. Please. We'll... we'll pay you.

27:32.203 --> 27:34.470
50 bucks. $40.

27:34.503 --> 27:36.670
Mom. Okay, $50. $50. Done.

27:36.703 --> 27:38.576
- Thank you.
- $40 and $50. There you go. Thank you so much.

27:38.576 --> 27:40.588
- All right, in we go.
- Okay.

27:40.588 --> 27:43.333
We're in a hurry.
Thanks. Come on, mom, mom.

27:43.333 --> 27:44.331
Go, go, go, go.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.149
What? What? What?

27:47.149 --> 27:49.318
Stop right there, miss. Code 9. Firearm.

27:49.318 --> 27:50.082
What's happening?

27:50.082 --> 27:51.461
Is this your bag, ma'am?

27:51.462 --> 27:54.301
Oh,oh, oh. Oh, wait a
minute. Wait a minute.

27:54.301 --> 27:57.401
This is actually kind
of... it's kind of funny.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.568
- It's not a real gun. I... I was...
- I need you to stand over here.

27:59.601 --> 28:01.901
No, no. I won it today. I was
at an award thing. It's a plaque.

28:01.935 --> 28:03.901
I won it as an award. It's not a real gun.

28:03.935 --> 28:04.880
I can show it to you.

28:04.881 --> 28:06.317
Excuse me. Step over there.

28:06.317 --> 28:07.900
- I'm sorry. We really need...
- I need you to stay right there.

28:07.900 --> 28:08.511
I can't believe this is happening.

28:08.511 --> 28:09.349
No, no, no. You don't understand.

28:09.349 --> 28:10.662
It's not a real gun. It's not a real...

28:10.662 --> 28:12.192
I think you need to listen to my daughter.

28:12.225 --> 28:13.392
You, too, ma'am. Stay right here.

28:13.393 --> 28:16.090
Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

28:19.329 --> 28:22.542
And stretch. Plié.

28:22.885 --> 28:24.370
Passé.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.436
Relevé.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.003
Sous-sous.

28:28.036 --> 28:30.036
And turn.

28:30.069 --> 28:31.570
Other side.

28:31.603 --> 28:32.836
Plié.

28:32.869 --> 28:34.436
Passé.

28:34.470 --> 28:36.902
Relevé.

28:36.936 --> 28:38.869
Sous-sous.

28:38.902 --> 28:40.536
Other side.

28:40.570 --> 28:42.470
Again.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.003
Relevé.

28:44.036 --> 28:46.503
And second.

28:46.536 --> 28:49.670
Hold.

28:49.703 --> 28:51.836
Hold.

28:51.869 --> 28:53.748
Sous-sous.

28:53.748 --> 28:56.699
Other side. Again.

28:56.699 --> 28:57.784
Plié.

28:57.784 --> 29:00.523
And stretch. Plié.

29:01.036 --> 29:03.403
So do you guys wanna go to lunch?

29:03.436 --> 29:06.713
Yeah, that would be great.

29:11.519 --> 29:12.931
Are you my stalker now?

29:12.931 --> 29:15.975
What? I'm not stalking you.
You gave me the address.

29:15.975 --> 29:17.608
I figured I'd come watch you dance.

29:17.609 --> 29:19.076
No. Wh... Justin, what are you doing here?

29:19.076 --> 29:20.394
I told you I need space.

29:21.234 --> 29:23.375
Rebecca, first of all,
all I do is give you space,

29:23.408 --> 29:24.300
but it's... it's not helping.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.611
Well, you can't help me. I
have to do this on my own.

29:30.677 --> 29:32.778
Okay, well, is this helping, the dancing?

29:32.811 --> 29:36.077
Yes. Yes.

29:36.110 --> 29:39.943
No. I don't know.

29:39.977 --> 29:42.943
I used to be good at this.
This used to be easy for me.

29:42.977 --> 29:45.144
Now I can barely stay on my feet.

29:45.177 --> 29:47.477
Okay, well,

29:47.511 --> 29:49.010
maybe...

29:49.043 --> 29:51.411
Maybe it's just too soon.

29:51.444 --> 29:53.544
I thought that... if I went back

29:53.577 --> 29:56.677
to doing something that
I knew I was good at,

29:56.711 --> 30:00.611
that it would all make sense, but...

30:00.644 --> 30:02.377
It doesn't.

30:04.778 --> 30:06.310
It's too hard.

30:09.077 --> 30:11.811
My body keeps letting me down.

30:16.744 --> 30:19.077
I feel so broken.

30:23.878 --> 30:25.811
I'm sorry.

30:29.711 --> 30:33.344
What are we gonna do now?

30:33.377 --> 30:36.010
I guess we try again.

30:36.043 --> 30:38.544
We start over.

30:38.577 --> 30:41.187
I don't know if I can do that.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.440
All right, look, Rebecca,

30:42.440 --> 30:44.544
you're... you're... you're talking
to a recovering drug addict.

30:44.544 --> 30:46.388
I know a thing or two about starting over.

30:46.388 --> 30:49.851
And you know what? It
takes time, all right?

30:49.851 --> 30:51.662
And sometimes you gotta
go back to the basics

30:51.662 --> 30:53.821
and... and... and work the
steps, but we can do it.

30:55.281 --> 30:58.551
I promise you that. Just don't give up.

31:08.816 --> 31:11.182
Oh, hey. You're home early.

31:11.215 --> 31:12.616
Yeah.

31:12.649 --> 31:15.415
Could you, um, sit down for a second?

31:15.449 --> 31:16.816
Okay.

31:18.349 --> 31:20.649
What's with the box?

31:20.682 --> 31:23.482
I quit today.

31:23.516 --> 31:25.862
- Kevin...
- I know. I'm sorry.

31:25.862 --> 31:27.714
I should have discussed it with you first.

31:27.714 --> 31:28.874
I mean, you realize we're in the middle

31:28.874 --> 31:30.039
of the greatest economic downturn

31:30.040 --> 31:32.960
- since the depression?
- I know. I kn... I had to do it.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.867
I... I just had to do it. I'm...

31:34.867 --> 31:35.964
I don't know what's happening to me,

31:35.964 --> 31:38.591
but I... I couldn't
be this person anymore.

31:39.607 --> 31:43.773
Okay. Well, I... I... I guess
we knew this was coming, right?

31:43.807 --> 31:46.707
Yeah, just not today.

31:48.540 --> 31:50.940
Well, we'll... we'll figure it out.

31:50.974 --> 31:54.673
Thank you.

31:54.707 --> 31:57.274
Look at me. I'm 38 years old.

31:57.307 --> 31:59.740
I thought I would've had
things figured out by now.

32:01.274 --> 32:03.274
Kevin, you're talking to somebody

32:03.307 --> 32:05.740
who used to sleep in his car.

32:05.773 --> 32:08.506
Feeling lost and aimless?

32:08.540 --> 32:09.807
Yeah.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.807
Join the club.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.683
I mean, it's like standard
operating procedure

32:13.683 --> 32:16.640
- for the rest of us.
- You're not mad?

32:16.673 --> 32:18.307
Of course not.

32:18.341 --> 32:20.440
I'm proud of you. You did a brave thing.

32:20.473 --> 32:22.904
I don't feel brave. I
practically ran out of there.

32:22.904 --> 32:24.871
I didn't even say goodbye.

32:24.904 --> 32:26.871
Well, that's just wrong.

32:26.904 --> 32:29.670
I know, but I'll call Robert tomorrow.

32:29.704 --> 32:32.704
Oh, my God. It's him.

32:32.737 --> 32:35.337
- Well... well, answer it.
- Well, I... I don't want to.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.704
Kevin, what are you, 6?

32:39.071 --> 32:41.871
Hello?

32:41.904 --> 32:43.670
Oh, hi.

32:43.704 --> 32:45.537
Uh, what, right now?

32:45.570 --> 32:48.171
Sure. I'll come over.

32:48.204 --> 32:49.704
O...

32:49.737 --> 32:51.120
What does he want?

32:51.120 --> 32:52.778
I have no idea.

32:58.204 --> 33:01.504
Sir, could you tell me
where they took my daughter?

33:01.537 --> 33:04.037
It's too late, mom.

33:04.071 --> 33:05.414
They'll already be married.

33:05.414 --> 33:07.959
No, don't say that. Honey,
you saw that line downstairs.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.392
Everything in this building
moves like molasses.

33:10.426 --> 33:13.025
I can't believe I pulled
another cranberry ball.

33:13.059 --> 33:15.392
No, you haven't. It's not
like he's left the country.

33:15.426 --> 33:16.830
You can still tell him how you feel.

33:16.831 --> 33:18.392
He has a wife, and I know it's not true,

33:18.426 --> 33:21.192
but why do I feel so sick about it?

33:21.225 --> 33:23.558
Because, Sarah, you're
in love with this man,

33:23.591 --> 33:26.558
and you don't want him to
marry anyone else but you.

33:26.591 --> 33:30.426
Mm, you tried to tell
me. I couldn't hear it.

33:30.458 --> 33:33.426
Look, Sarah, if we don't make it,

33:33.458 --> 33:35.426
and... and we're too late,

33:35.458 --> 33:38.025
and Luc and Ginny are
married, it doesn't matter.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.023
Do you hear me? It doesn't matter.

33:40.023 --> 33:42.451
You just have to work
very hard from now on

33:42.451 --> 33:44.213
to be honest with yourself
and honest with him.

33:44.213 --> 33:47.545
If you feel something, anything,
you can't be afraid to tell him,

33:47.579 --> 33:49.445
whether it's good or bad.

33:49.479 --> 33:53.981
The two of you love each
other. Any moron could see that.

33:53.981 --> 33:57.714
And you both have to work
very hard to protect it.

33:57.747 --> 34:00.080
It's not too late?

34:00.113 --> 34:02.113
No.

34:02.147 --> 34:03.781
Thanks, mom.

34:03.814 --> 34:06.547
Doesn't this move you in any way?

34:06.581 --> 34:09.347
Ma'am, I watch "Oprah."
Nothing surprises me.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.880
Oh.

34:10.914 --> 34:13.014
- Okay, we're free.
- Oh, God. We're free.

34:13.047 --> 34:15.246
Just a little mix-up, ladies.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.170
Mrs. McCallister, you

34:16.170 --> 34:18.080
- definitely have my vote.
- Oh, well, thank you.

34:18.112 --> 34:20.033
- Oh! Is... is he married yet?
- How the hell do I know?

34:20.033 --> 34:21.900
- Can we still make it?
- I don't know.

34:21.900 --> 34:22.507
I think we can make it. Come on.

34:22.507 --> 34:26.010
Okay. Kitty McCallister, Senator, 2010.

34:26.010 --> 34:28.511
This woman and this
man have come before us

34:28.543 --> 34:30.511
to be joined in the state of matrimony,

34:30.543 --> 34:34.010
witnessed and vested before
me in the state of California.

34:34.043 --> 34:37.244
Take hands and repeat after me... I...

34:37.277 --> 34:39.578
- Luc!
- S... Sarah?

34:39.610 --> 34:42.411
- Is he married yet?
- Excuse me.

34:42.444 --> 34:43.917
- It's okay. They're with me.
- And who are you?

34:43.917 --> 34:45.917
She's with him. Um, Sarah...

34:45.951 --> 34:48.318
Luc, I'm sorry. I'm not cool with this.

34:48.351 --> 34:50.717
I thought I was. I... I
tried to be, but I'm not.

34:50.750 --> 34:53.984
I'm not. But then... then I
started thinking, I was afraid,

34:54.016 --> 34:56.342
and there was Suzy Lang,
and you came back for me.

34:56.344 --> 34:58.251
Sarah, English is not his first language.

34:58.284 --> 35:00.418
Luc, I love you.

35:02.356 --> 35:03.728
I love you, too.

35:05.944 --> 35:08.312
Wait. Are you two gonna get married now?

35:08.345 --> 35:10.312
No.

35:10.345 --> 35:12.245
No, we're not.

35:20.727 --> 35:23.273
Don't tell me you have
never seen "the graduate."

35:23.273 --> 35:27.621
Well, Dustin Hoffman is madly
in love with this girl, Elaine,

35:27.621 --> 35:29.587
but she's about to marry the wrong guy.

35:29.621 --> 35:31.587
So he bursts into the church,

35:31.621 --> 35:34.188
and she leaves the other guy at the altar.

35:34.221 --> 35:36.621
And so what happened next?

35:36.654 --> 35:38.988
- That's it.
- Mm.

35:39.021 --> 35:41.121
They just stare at each other.

35:41.155 --> 35:43.687
Then they get this look
over their faces like,

35:43.721 --> 35:45.521
"what have we done?"

35:56.538 --> 35:57.559
Nora?

35:57.559 --> 35:59.826
- Yes? I'm in here.
- Oh, good. Hi.

35:59.859 --> 36:02.904
Hi. God, I wish you'd been there.

36:02.904 --> 36:05.652
What a riot. I... I think it's easier

36:05.652 --> 36:07.908
to plan a wedding than it is to stop one.

36:07.908 --> 36:10.008
Listen, we have to talk.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.240
What?

36:11.274 --> 36:13.641
Have you ever heard of Narrow Lake?

36:13.674 --> 36:14.908
Why?

36:14.941 --> 36:17.841
William must have bought
it in 1973. Listen to this.

36:17.874 --> 36:20.841
Holly found out that York
opened a "doing business as"

36:20.874 --> 36:22.841
under that name, Narrow Lake.

36:22.874 --> 36:26.141
We think this might be pay dirt, Nora.

36:26.175 --> 36:28.908
- Yes, I've... I've heard of Narrow Lake.
- You have?

36:28.941 --> 36:30.908
Well, that's great. That's great.

36:30.941 --> 36:33.240
So... so... so do you know where it is?

36:33.274 --> 36:35.075
No.

36:35.108 --> 36:38.607
"Let's go out tonight for our own sake

36:38.641 --> 36:42.607
and visit a place that
I call Narrow Lake."

36:42.641 --> 36:45.774
It's a song. William used
to sing it all the time.

36:45.808 --> 36:47.340
It's a song.

36:47.374 --> 36:50.274
It's just a little ditty.

36:50.307 --> 36:54.108
This could be the hidden
value of Ojai Foods, Nora.

36:56.874 --> 36:58.874
Did you find out where he is?

36:58.908 --> 37:02.407
York? No. No, he was
staying at a hotel downtown.

37:02.441 --> 37:04.655
He checked out a few weeks ago.

37:04.655 --> 37:06.916
He'll be back.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.764
Oh, my God.

37:09.797 --> 37:12.864
Oh, my God, Buffy, you just don't go away.

37:12.897 --> 37:15.597
- Consider me fired.
- Really?

37:15.630 --> 37:18.597
Yes. I was just dropping
off some wine for you

37:18.630 --> 37:21.964
as a thank-you gift for giving me a shot.

37:21.997 --> 37:25.797
Are you trying to make me
feel guilty? Because I do.

37:25.830 --> 37:27.119
No, I'm not. I'm not, really.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.420
I just wanted to tell you that I love you

37:29.453 --> 37:32.835
- and I'm gonna miss you.
- Really?

37:32.835 --> 37:33.950
Really.

37:33.950 --> 37:35.916
I guess I'll... I'll leave you to it.

37:35.950 --> 37:39.992
Uh, and I dropped a C-note
on this wine, so promise me

37:39.992 --> 37:42.959
you'll drink it with Robert
and not on a campaign bus.

37:42.992 --> 37:45.525
Oh, no, no. That...
that's not gonna happen,

37:45.559 --> 37:48.392
because I think you and I have
to drink this bottle together.

37:48.392 --> 37:50.335
Well, you know me. I
never turn down a drink.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.926
True. True. But I'm not gonna
hold your hair back this time.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.792
Oh, no, no. I... I can drink.
I... I'm good at it now.

37:55.826 --> 37:57.363
Look, I know you think
this is a good idea,

37:57.363 --> 37:58.970
but I really don't want
to know what this job is.

37:58.970 --> 38:00.430
You know me and my family.
We can't keep secrets.

38:00.431 --> 38:02.845
Yeah, but you deserve to
know, and there's no pressure.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.305
You can still leave if you want.

38:04.306 --> 38:05.811
Why did I have to come back here?

38:05.845 --> 38:07.845
Because we needed a secure room.

38:07.878 --> 38:09.951
I've had my office swept for bugs.

38:09.951 --> 38:13.145
Swept for bugs? Robert,
please don't tell me.

38:13.145 --> 38:15.445
Don't worry. I've had you
cleared for this information.

38:15.479 --> 38:16.516
Okay, you know what? I can't be trusted.

38:16.516 --> 38:17.982
I'm... I'm actually ticklish.

38:18.015 --> 38:20.482
I'd be one feather away from
telling Al Qaeda everything.

38:20.516 --> 38:22.704
- Just... shh.
- It doesn't matter what it is.

38:22.705 --> 38:24.216
I'm not gonna change my mind.

38:24.249 --> 38:27.349
No, I'm not gonna change
my mind. I'm not...

38:27.382 --> 38:29.882
We're gonna miss you.

38:29.915 --> 38:32.549
- We're gonna miss you, Kevin.
- Great job.

38:32.583 --> 38:35.549
All right, all right,
get this man a drink.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.282
Um...

38:40.316 --> 38:42.516
Kevin and I have been through a lot...

38:44.082 --> 38:47.516
a campaign, a heart attack...

38:47.549 --> 38:49.516
and a few scandals.

38:49.549 --> 38:51.015
Yeah.

38:51.049 --> 38:53.848
And we have disagreed.

38:53.882 --> 38:56.416
We, uh, we disagree a lot.

38:56.449 --> 38:59.583
Kevin has done more than argue.

38:59.616 --> 39:03.982
He's taught us that our
beliefs are worth fighting for,

39:04.015 --> 39:05.982
even if we don't know

39:06.015 --> 39:09.549
exactly where they're gonna take us.

39:09.583 --> 39:12.015
Kevin, you can't possibly know

39:12.049 --> 39:15.249
how you've transformed our work,

39:15.282 --> 39:17.549
and our lives.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.494
And from now on, when I
have to make a decision,

39:19.494 --> 39:22.424
I'm gonna take a moment... not a big one,

39:22.424 --> 39:24.391
not like, you know, forever...

39:24.424 --> 39:28.190
but I'm gonna take a moment,
and I'm gonna ask myself,

39:28.224 --> 39:30.557
"what would Kevin do?"

39:32.324 --> 39:34.491
To Kevin Walker,

39:34.524 --> 39:36.190
my brother...

39:36.224 --> 39:40.290
to whatever you do in the future.

39:40.324 --> 39:43.157
In politics, as in life,

39:43.190 --> 39:45.224
there are no endings,

39:45.257 --> 39:46.891
only new beginnings.

39:50.924 --> 39:54.524
Here's to the start of something new.

39:54.557 --> 39:57.190
Don't you understand?

39:57.224 --> 40:00.190
I already have a plan.

40:00.224 --> 40:01.716
I'm waiting...

40:01.716 --> 40:02.574
You didn't really think.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.040
I was gonna tell you
about the job, did you?

40:05.073 --> 40:07.874
I hate you.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.641
- Darryl.
- Good luck.

41:10.581 --> 41:12.548
Do you have any regrets?

41:12.581 --> 41:14.149
About today?

41:15.682 --> 41:18.248
Remember when I said
we need to have faith?

41:18.281 --> 41:19.381
Mm.

41:19.415 --> 41:21.882
And you said I was talking to an agnostic.

41:21.915 --> 41:24.049
Yeah.

41:24.082 --> 41:27.815
I know now it's not true.

41:27.848 --> 41:30.082
You believe in us.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.782
I do.

41:33.915 --> 41:35.615
Four weeks.

41:37.682 --> 41:39.515
Four weeks.

41:39.515 --> 41:44.515
