HAMMOND: He sold the idea to the studio.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.353
He obviously got the whole thing from
his knowledge of the Stargate Program.

00:31.464 --> 00:33.022
No, if the Air Force
didn't want it to happen,

00:33.133 --> 00:35.727
they wouldn't have let it go this far.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.804
We thought we'd never get to meet you.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.911
We led them straight here.

make them think
the whole thing is going to be jam-packed.

01:19.279 --> 01:21.213
I love jam.

01:22.449 --> 01:26.545
Oh, I get it, it's yet another playful twist
on words in your Earth language.

01:27.854 --> 01:30.084
It makes us look stupid.

01:30.190 --> 01:31.953
JACKSON: You realize it's not actually us.

01:32.058 --> 01:35.050
Okay, okay,
it makes the characters look stupid.

01:35.161 --> 01:37.925
I mean, do you really think
the best way to introduce the heroes of

01:38.031 --> 01:40.329
the story is to show them
causing a massive catastrophe?

01:40.433 --> 01:42.264
That's realistic.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.859
- I don't care.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

01:44.971 --> 01:46.529
You know, you say that about everything.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.834
Come to think of it, why am I doing this?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.843
To make sure that the Air Force
is being properly represented

01:51.945 --> 01:56.905
and because General O'Neill
has requested you specifically.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.909
Of course he did.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.987
Jackson, how often do we get to give
notes on a big Hollywood feature script?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.518
I believe this is intended to be
a television movie.

02:05.625 --> 02:10.187
A fictionalized, albeit slightly ridiculous,
version of Stargate Command

02:10.296 --> 02:13.754
is an excellent cover for the real thing
in the event of a security leak.

02:13.967 --> 02:14.991
Plausible deniability.

02:15.101 --> 02:17.228
I'm sorry, sir,
did you say slightly ridiculous?

02:17.337 --> 02:19.897
You're doing this. You have no choice.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.098
Just give the man five minutes.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.472
I'll get you out of this
when the time comes.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.276
VALA: I've been looking through this,
and there doesn't seem to be

02:30.383 --> 02:34.877
any mention of
a sexy female alien anywhere.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.589
I'm not even in this.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.317
CARTER: You know,
the really unbelievable part

02:39.425 --> 02:40.756
is that anyone would consider spending

02:40.860 --> 02:42.953
millions of dollars on this thing.

02:43.062 --> 02:45.223
I mean, seriously, all these writers
and they couldn't come up

02:45.331 --> 02:46.355
with anything better?

02:46.466 --> 02:48.957
I don't know, I've been watching a lot
of television lately

02:49.068 --> 02:52.868
and, apart from one glaring omission,
it doesn't seem to be that bad.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.668
Maybe we can make it better.

02:55.775 --> 02:56.764
No, I'm with Sam on this one.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.709
I mean, who makes a movie out of
a series that only lasted three episodes?

02:59.812 --> 03:03.043
It allegedly performed well on DVD.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.879
No, I'm not using any shots
from the series.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.714
It's a movie, not a clip show.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.022
The budget is the budget.

03:11.124 --> 03:14.457
They are a bunch of pencil-pushing,
bean-counting idiots.

03:14.694 --> 03:19.131
You tell them if they don't like it,
I'm going to take it somewhere else.

03:22.001 --> 03:24.765
You know not to say that last part, right?

03:26.406 --> 03:28.897
Yeah, movie, not clip show, is fine.

Our lead backed out.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.733
How am I supposed to tell a story
without my lead character?

06:17.844 --> 06:21.075
Easy. You just bring in a character
to replace him.

06:25.485 --> 06:26.543
What?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.451
MARTIN: You guys have to help me.

06:28.554 --> 06:32.217
I mean, how can I keep
the main character in the story

06:32.325 --> 06:35.590
without actually having
the actor who plays him?

06:36.095 --> 06:39.861
Well, you could have the other characters
refer to him all the time,

06:39.966 --> 06:42.560
maybe get him on the phone
once in a while.

06:42.668 --> 06:46.195
Yeah, right. I mean something cool,

06:47.073 --> 06:50.600
like face-switching or body-swapping.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.708
As if anyone would believe that.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.947
Come on, you guys must have
some real-life experiences I can draw on.

06:58.985 --> 07:02.386
Well, there was that time that
Colonel O'Neill was invisible.

07:03.656 --> 07:06.648
So, essentially, what I think happened
is that you were bombarded by

07:06.759 --> 07:09.728
the particle field being emanated
by the cloaking generator.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.093
See, you were in the engine room
standing right next to it

07:12.198 --> 07:14.132
when the device was turned on.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.201
That would account for
the minute traces of radiation

07:16.302 --> 07:17.428
we've been picking up from you.

07:17.537 --> 07:21.633
But the good news is, I think
I've found a way to reverse the process.

07:21.741 --> 07:24.642
We have to go back to the mothership
and get the cloaking generator.

07:24.744 --> 07:26.974
- Sam, who are you talking to?
- Colonel O'Neill.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.707
I was just explaining to him how
we're going to make him visible again.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.408

- I can't believe he did that to me again.
- Yeah.

07:37.857 --> 07:40.189
You know, getting that cloaking
generator off that mothership,

07:40.293 --> 07:41.453
that's going to be
the least of our problems.

07:41.561 --> 07:45.122
Now, getting Jack to help,
that's going to be the hard part.

07:45.431 --> 07:49.060
- Oh, don't tell me.
- Yes. He likes being invisible.

- You cannot remain this way, O'Neill.
- Why not?

It gives us an advantage over the Goa'uld.

as my own sweet, salient self.

mention the guy at all.

invisibility can be very powerful.

open that can of worms.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.584
You don't want your heroes to
become too powerful.

Well, you could always invent
some negative side-effects.

10:29.829 --> 10:32.889
That's how we talked Colonel O'Neill
into becoming visible again.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.127

your 200th mission, Colonel Mitchell.

I said 200th trip through the gate.

- Indeed.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.263

11:48.374 --> 11:51.468
We've got 10 seconds before
the time dilation field is activated.

11:51.577 --> 11:55.775
If we don't make it through the gate,
we'll be stuck here forever!

11:59.385 --> 12:01.615
Okay, this could be a problem.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.882
- That was close, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

12:05.257 --> 12:07.282
JACKSON: Are you serious?
MARTIN: What?

12:07.393 --> 12:08.860
How did we escape?

12:09.495 --> 12:11.463
- They.
- Fine, they, they, they.

12:11.564 --> 12:15.432
- How did they escape?
- Isn't it obvious?

12:15.534 --> 12:19.163
Even if the valley wasn't filled with Jaffa,
we could never have made it

12:19.271 --> 12:22.206
to the gate and dialed out
in under 10 seconds.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.839
Good. See, that's why we're here.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.412
So, what do you think? 30 seconds?

12:27.513 --> 12:29.777
Maybe not such a round number.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.311
How about 38?

12:32.418 --> 12:33.612
What difference does it make?

12:33.719 --> 12:36.779
I mean, it's not like you're going to have
an actual ticking clock on the screen.

12:36.889 --> 12:39.756
- That's brilliant!
- That's ridiculous.

12:39.859 --> 12:43.693
Trust me, jeopardy plus ticking clock
is box office.

12:43.796 --> 12:46.492
It's the E=MC-squared
of the entertainment world.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.930
Ask any executive.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.692
Except I think you've replaced jeopardy
with certain death.

12:51.971 --> 12:56.374
Oh, come on. You guys have escaped
situations more dire than this before.

12:56.675 --> 12:59.735
- He has a point.
- So show the actual escape.

13:00.146 --> 13:03.547
No, no, no.
You can't give away too much, too early.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.843
It'll step on the ending.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.351
Maybe if my character doesn't say,
"This is a problem."

13:08.454 --> 13:11.014
He could say something like,
"This should be easy."

13:11.190 --> 13:14.682
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's not you.

13:14.860 --> 13:18.057
Colonel Danning
is based on Colonel O'Neill.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.367
Please tell me
you have the gate working again.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.098
We're running another diagnostic,
but right now, we're stumped.

13:27.206 --> 13:29.003
The power's getting through
to the capacitors,

13:29.108 --> 13:31.338
but, for some reason,
the charge isn't holding.

13:31.443 --> 13:34.310
That's causing the control crystal to
send feedback into the interface

13:34.413 --> 13:38.144
and reset the programming code
of the base computer's dialing protocol.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.447
Whoa! That was awesome. Say that again.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.285
No.

13:45.191 --> 13:50.026
Oh. Everybody, take five.
I've got to get that down before I forget it.

13:50.129 --> 13:52.495
MARTIN: The power getting
to the flux capacitor,

13:52.598 --> 13:56.090
but feedback is not feeding back
into the feedback face.

13:56.202 --> 13:57.635
This is gold!

13:59.538 --> 14:03.065
Forget about the techno talk.
No one's really interested in it.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.170
You're an alien, right?

14:05.277 --> 14:07.871
Exactly, and I know
just what this movie needs.

14:07.980 --> 14:12.383
So how would you know what sci-fi fans
from Earth would be interested in?

14:13.252 --> 14:17.348
- Aren't you also an alien?
- Yeah, but I've been here quite a while.

14:17.723 --> 14:21.159
Right. Look, I think I know a good story
when I hear one.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.854
Don't you want this movie to appeal
to a broad range of people?

14:24.196 --> 14:27.563
- From Earth.
- I have all kinds of fabulous adventures,

14:27.666 --> 14:30.931
none of which have been classified
by the Air Force.

14:32.471 --> 14:35.304
- Okay, shoot. Give me your best one.
- Right.

14:35.407 --> 14:38.171
I was in a stolen cargo ship,
on my way home,

14:38.310 --> 14:42.371
<i>when a solar flare from a nearby star</i>
<i>wreaked havoc with my navigation system</i>

14:42.481 --> 14:44.949
and I was forced to crash-land
on the nearest planet.

14:45.050 --> 14:46.449
In a bizarre twist of fate,

14:46.552 --> 14:49.715
<i>I crashed right on top of the Goa 'uld</i>
<i>who ruled that planet,</i>

14:49.855 --> 14:52.688
<i>which was fortunate because</i>
<i>my ship was too badly damaged to repair</i>

14:52.791 --> 14:54.418
<i>and I needed help.</i>

14:54.960 --> 14:57.656
<i>The local villagers were very grateful.</i>

14:58.530 --> 15:01.863
<i>They introduced me</i>
<i>to a lovely fair-haired Tok'ra</i>

15:01.967 --> 15:03.730
<i>who had been hiding out on the planet.</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:06.498
<i>She told me the legend</i>
<i>of a powerful Ascended being</i>

15:06.605 --> 15:09.836
<i>who supposedly lived in some distant,</i>
<i>far-off mountains</i>

15:09.942 --> 15:11.273
<i>through a treacherous forest.</i>

15:11.377 --> 15:13.436
Look, I don't have all day.
Cut to the chase.

15:13.545 --> 15:16.070
All right. I met up with a number
of my friends along the way,

15:16.215 --> 15:18.809
and after a dangerous
and eventful journey,

15:18.918 --> 15:22.251
we finally come face to face
with the Ascended being.

15:22.621 --> 15:24.885
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

15:24.990 --> 15:27.652
Well, at first I thought
I just wanted to go home,

15:27.760 --> 15:31.560
but now I've decided
I'd quite like to be a part of something.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.258
A regular part, if you catch my drift.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.561
Oh, and these guys have
their own issues. Boys?

15:50.349 --> 15:51.907
That's <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

15:53.485 --> 15:57.046
- Oh, you've seen that one?
- Yeah.

15:58.023 --> 16:01.049
Oh, that's my phone. Martin Lloyd.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.288
- I didn't hear it ring.
- It's on vibrate.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.359
MARTIN: Yes, go ahead.

16:06.498 --> 16:07.800
I can sing.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.764
- So how's it going?
- Not well.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.307
Samantha, 200 is waiting.

16:16.408 --> 16:17.466
Right now, I'm just hoping

16:17.576 --> 16:19.942
we haven't done something
to permanently damage the gate.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.639
How can something work perfectly fine
for 10 years

16:22.748 --> 16:24.272
then all of a sudden
it doesn't work anymore?

16:24.383 --> 16:26.681
I don't know. Okay, try it now.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.681
We're getting some strange
power readings here, Colonel.

16:33.959 --> 16:37.690
- Shut it down.
- It's not responding.

16:37.796 --> 16:40.731
The gate's drawing massive amounts
of energy into its capacitors.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.233
Close the blast door and the iris.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.012
I can't shut it down.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.872
Hurry.

17:31.316 --> 17:34.285

- The mountain blows up?
- No possible hope for survival.

17:41.393 --> 17:44.658
Cool, huh? I just wrote it
based on what's going on with the gate.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.363
I love it when art imitates life.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.562
Hang on. We're alive in the next scene.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.434
Oh, I just haven't fixed that part yet.

17:53.539 --> 17:58.203
I'm thinking I can back-sell it and say
you were beamed out at the last second.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.574
- JACKSON: Beamed out?
- Sure. Why not?

18:00.679 --> 18:04.171
- Is that not too convenient?
- MARTIN: Not if you hang a lantern on it.

18:04.283 --> 18:06.376
- What's that?
- It's a writer's term.

18:06.518 --> 18:09.976
Another character points out
how convenient it is.

18:10.656 --> 18:14.649
Dr. Levant can say,
"Well, that was great timing."

That way the audience knows
I intended for it to be convenient,

- Yes.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.557
Where do they think it comes from?

24:56.061 --> 24:58.791
How am I supposed to do a movie
without any actors?

24:59.064 --> 25:01.760
MITCHELL: Carter, correct me if I'm wrong
on this, but is it not

25:01.867 --> 25:04.961
a fact of parallel dimension physics
that each of us exists

25:05.070 --> 25:08.233
somewhere in some universe in whatever
way, shape, or form we can imagine?

25:08.340 --> 25:11.707
Any way, shape, or form we can imagine.
We've seen it for ourselves.

25:11.843 --> 25:13.276
There you go.

25:14.212 --> 25:15.839
Use your imagination.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.254
All right, people.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.659
We created this multi-billion dollar
facility under Cheyenne Mountain

25:31.763 --> 25:33.958
so that we can use this thing.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.958
Anyone know how?

25:41.473 --> 25:43.771
Sir, we thought you knew.

25:44.910 --> 25:49.438
I do know this, we need to put
together a team,

25:49.548 --> 25:53.848
starting with the most beautiful,
battle-ready scientific genius I know,

25:54.619 --> 25:58.385
- Captain Doctor Samantha Carter.
- Reporting for duty, sir.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.787
What can you tell us, Captain?

26:02.861 --> 26:05.694
Well, at first glance, I suspect the device
creates a stable wormhole

26:05.797 --> 26:08.664
between superconducting rings that
have been placed in fixed positions

26:08.767 --> 26:09.756
elsewhere in the galaxy...

26:09.868 --> 26:11.426
...converts matter into energy
at the event horizon,

26:11.536 --> 26:13.697
once the initial vortex has subsided,
of course.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.638
And just because my sex organs
are on the inside instead of the outside

26:16.741 --> 26:17.901
doesn't mean that I can't handle...

26:18.009 --> 26:20.807
Provided, of course, that sufficient energy
has been channeled to the device

26:20.912 --> 26:23.779
and that the correct coordinates
have been calculated.

26:25.116 --> 26:26.811
Okay, get to it.

26:28.186 --> 26:31.678
Next, we need a bookworm adventurer
who can say "brains" and "guts"

26:31.790 --> 26:33.485
in 27 languages.

26:33.592 --> 26:35.116
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.093
Why have I been brought here?
This is not...

26:40.265 --> 26:41.232
What is that?

26:41.499 --> 26:43.160
The reason you're here, Doctor.

26:43.268 --> 26:47.864
This big ring was discovered
in the sands of Egypt, near Giza.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.200
Then I was right.

26:51.543 --> 26:54.205
The pyramids really were landing sites
for interplanetary starships that

26:54.312 --> 26:58.271
enslaved primitive human populations
by posing as their gods.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.975
Well, we found the ring in the sand.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.179
These symbols, they look familiar.

27:04.389 --> 27:07.552
They're like constellations.
Don't you see? Here.

27:10.629 --> 27:14.087
If each symbol represents
a specific point in space,

27:14.199 --> 27:17.498
then six of them
would create a sort of box.

27:17.602 --> 27:21.333
The intersection point between those
six points would indicate a destination.

27:21.439 --> 27:26.604
Maybe, just maybe,
the seventh marks the starting point.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.438
Is there a monitor that shows
these symbols in detail?

27:29.547 --> 27:31.412
Over here, Dr. Jackson.

27:38.590 --> 27:39.750
Wait.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.917
This one seems different.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.756
You found the ring in Egypt.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.352
The pyramid represents Earth.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.556
This symbol has to be the point of origin.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.260
It was under our noses the whole time.

27:50.735 --> 27:53.226
I feel so stupid.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.775
And now what this team needs is a leader,
someone who'll laugh in the face

27:57.876 --> 28:00.868
of his enemy,
even when it's inappropriate.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.780
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.782
I thought I told you I retired.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.086
I thought you said you were tired.

28:11.623 --> 28:14.524
Well, as a matter of fact, I am a little tired.

28:14.626 --> 28:16.651
There's no time for that now.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.820
You have a mission to lead.

28:18.930 --> 28:19.919
Right!

28:22.200 --> 28:24.191
Sergeant? Make it spin.

28:24.969 --> 28:26.061
Spin?

28:27.338 --> 28:28.930
Sir, it doesn't spin.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.234
What?

28:30.341 --> 28:32.536
It has to spin. It's round.

28:32.644 --> 28:35.545
Spinning is so much cooler
than not spinning.

28:35.647 --> 28:36.978
I'm the General.

28:37.082 --> 28:39.175
I want it to spin. Now!

28:39.718 --> 28:41.242
Yes, sir.

28:44.789 --> 28:46.552
Hey, look at that.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.355
HARRIMAN: Chevron one is lit up.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.262
I wonder what we're going to find
on the other side.

28:55.366 --> 28:57.163
Whatever it is, I'll bet it's amazing.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.328
Well, don't get too excited.
It's just a simple recon.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.838
Aren't you the least bit curious
about what's out there?

29:02.941 --> 29:06.035
Well, I'm just hoping we find
some new meat for the team,

29:06.144 --> 29:11.810
preferably something bald, mysterious,
you know, the warrior type,

29:11.916 --> 29:14.817
with lots of, you know, muscles.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.878
Sir, the odds against any alien life forms
we encounter looking remotely human

29:18.990 --> 29:20.685
are astronomical.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.655
Yeah, well...

29:23.561 --> 29:24.629
We'll see.

29:24.629 --> 29:24.890
We'll see.

- Colonel O'Neill, you have a go.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.345
Godspeed.

29:43.648 --> 29:45.445
Easy for him to say.

29:54.325 --> 29:55.292
Okay.

29:56.661 --> 30:00.461
We're all gonna do this together
on three, all right? Okay?

30:01.499 --> 30:02.466

have puppet O'Neill

on a one-third scale motorcycle.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.779
Look, you don't know the business
like I do.

30:51.883 --> 30:57.753
I don't have any money, so I have to
give the actors something else.

30:58.389 --> 31:01.051
- Bigger trailers?
- I can't afford that either.

31:01.159 --> 31:06.563
No, I have to give them something that
costs me nothing but no actor can refuse.

31:06.865 --> 31:07.923
And what's that?

31:08.032 --> 31:09.795
A good ego-stroking.

31:10.501 --> 31:13.993
I have to make them think that
I re-wrote the script just for them.

31:14.105 --> 31:17.541
In this draft, there has to be something
that makes them want to do this movie

31:17.842 --> 31:19.400

It's okay to say that you missed us, sir.

38:56.967 --> 39:00.425
The writers are really great guys,
all of them.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.062
Men, you know.

39:02.573 --> 39:04.564
Yeah, it's a bit of a boys' club.

39:04.675 --> 39:08.111
The real challenge was coming up
with a good catch phrase.

39:09.714 --> 39:12.376
"It's what I do."

39:13.384 --> 39:15.978
"It's what I do."

39:17.521 --> 39:21.719
That was so, you know, good.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.619
It defined Colonel Danning.

39:24.995 --> 39:28.123
I just don't think they know
what they want to do with my character.

39:28.232 --> 39:32.760
I probably should have taken up golf
a long time ago.

39:33.671 --> 39:35.730
Just... Just kidding.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.335
And I needed something even better

39:38.442 --> 39:43.436
to make you forget about the guy
that fans loved to watch

39:43.547 --> 39:46.015
for the first seven years of the show.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.982
I know he was here for eight,

39:48.085 --> 39:51.316
but, you know, a lot of people say
he just kind of phoned it in

39:51.889 --> 39:53.083
that last season.

39:53.190 --> 39:56.921
Yeah, well, that's ancient history.
We don't talk about that around here.

39:57.261 --> 40:00.492
The fact of the matter is, I don't
really even know what happened there.

40:00.598 --> 40:03.294
You know, to me, it never felt like
I was leaving the show.

40:03.401 --> 40:05.198
I just needed a little space,
a little time, you know?

40:05.302 --> 40:07.236
I wanted to get back to my roots.
Theater, right?

40:07.338 --> 40:09.863
So I go to New York, do a little Broadway,

40:09.974 --> 40:11.441
off-off-Broadway.
Either way, it doesn't matter.

40:11.542 --> 40:14.670
Acting, you know?
Acting without having people hurling

40:14.779 --> 40:17.907
papier-mвchй boulders at you all (BLEEP)
Day. It was great, you know?

40:18.015 --> 40:20.176
I like them both. I like boulders.
I'm fine with that.

40:20.284 --> 40:23.481
This production runs
like a well-oiled machine,

40:23.587 --> 40:26.784
and, sure, that starts from the top,
but, I mean,

40:26.891 --> 40:29.052
we all love the show.

40:29.460 --> 40:34.227
The gaffers, the lighting guy, the medic,

40:34.331 --> 40:37.095
the makeup and the caterers.

40:37.201 --> 40:38.293
It's like a family.

40:38.402 --> 40:41.838
The writers were trying to come up
with a catch phrase.

40:42.373 --> 40:47.333
"I can get behind that,"
was something we tried for a while.

40:47.578 --> 40:52.038
Anyway, I mean, I'd actually like
to do some writing.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.708
Maybe have a baby.

40:53.818 --> 40:54.785
(EX CLAIMS)

40:54.919 --> 40:56.648
It just hit me.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.554
Sweet...

40:59.657 --> 41:00.624
(BLEEPING)

41:04.495 --> 41:07.726
And we can get away with that,
too, because it's cable.

41:08.065 --> 41:10.932
You can't get there without the fans,
right? I have to thank them.

41:11.101 --> 41:13.467
I've got to thank specifically the ones...

41:13.571 --> 41:16.938
Oh, God, what's it called?
SaveDrLevant. Com.

41:17.041 --> 41:18.702
Have you seen the site?
I mean, it's insane.

41:18.809 --> 41:22.370
Apparently they get dozens of hits
a month, whatever. I think that's a lot.

41:22.513 --> 41:26.745
But between them and the ad in <i>Variety</i>
that they put out, I'm pretty sure

41:26.851 --> 41:29.820
that went a long way towards convincing
the producers to take me back.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.581
Have me... To invite me back.

41:31.689 --> 41:34.681
It wasn't their decision, you know.
They called, said, "Hey, do you want it?"

41:34.792 --> 41:36.054
You know, and I was ready.

41:36.160 --> 41:39.618
What I think really makes this show
what it is,

41:40.397 --> 41:45.425
is the chemistry with the cast.

41:45.536 --> 41:46.503
(MUSICAL CELL PHONE RINGING)

41:46.604 --> 41:48.162
Yeah. Oh, could you hold on?

41:48.272 --> 41:49.933
Stop the tape.

41:50.040 --> 41:52.008
Who does he think he is?

41:52.610 --> 41:57.274
Well, you tell that ungrateful little (BLEEP)
Bag to shove it up his (BLEEP)

41:57.548 --> 42:01.416
Yeah, yeah, let him try to get a job
that pays this much.

42:04.622 --> 42:07.420
You weren't rolling, were... Okay.

42:09.093 --> 42:10.583
What... What was I saying?

42:10.694 --> 42:13.424
Oh, yes, the cast.

42:15.065 --> 42:16.225
Holy...

42:16.333 --> 42:17.857
(BLEEPING)

42:22.806 --> 42:24.706
That would be, like, a 19.

42:24.808 --> 42:26.969
That's it? You're good? All right.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.610
Can I get my (BLEEP) sandwich, please?

42:30.147 --> 42:32.012
All right. Hey, thanks, man.

42:32.316 --> 42:35.046
Science fiction is an existential metaphor

42:35.152 --> 42:38.588
that allows us to tell stories
about the human condition.

42:38.789 --> 42:42.350
Isaac Asimov once said, "Individual
science fiction stories may seem

42:42.459 --> 42:46.691
"as trivial as ever to the blinder critics
and philosophers of today,

42:46.797 --> 42:50.392
"but the core of science fiction,
its essence, has become crucial

42:50.501 --> 42:53.368
"to our salvation,
if we are to be saved at all."
