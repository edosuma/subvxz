WEBVTT

01:33.963 --> 01:37.713
You never blow your whistle!
Blow, asshole!

01:37.880 --> 01:40.172
I can see it from here. Blow!

01:42.088 --> 01:43.088
Jesus!

01:47.338 --> 01:48.505
Come on! Come on!

01:49.255 --> 01:50.297
Yes!

01:50.713 --> 01:51.838
Why did you blow?

01:54.338 --> 01:56.005
Why is it disallowed?

01:57.297 --> 01:57.922
What?

02:04.005 --> 02:04.630
Fine.

02:08.005 --> 02:11.088
- You look just like her.
- Really, honey?

02:11.630 --> 02:15.463
- It isn't too much?
- No! It's fucking dope.

02:16.505 --> 02:19.755
I'm gonna burn your tongue
in the curling iron. Watch your mouth!

02:20.922 --> 02:22.463
Come on, Madrid!

02:24.255 --> 02:26.963
What are you dribbling for?
Asshole!

02:29.505 --> 02:30.922
Pass it!

02:31.672 --> 02:33.130
Pass it!

02:36.797 --> 02:38.047
How does it look?

02:39.297 --> 02:40.547
Bad, bad, bad.

02:40.713 --> 02:42.630
Barcelona is all over us.

02:50.672 --> 02:53.047
Foul him! Do something!

03:13.255 --> 03:14.505
Beer!

03:20.172 --> 03:23.713
Penalty!
That was a clear foul!

03:23.880 --> 03:25.630
- Dad.
- That's a penalty!

03:25.797 --> 03:27.380
- Dad!
- Fucking asshole!

03:27.547 --> 03:28.505
- Dad!
- What?

03:28.672 --> 03:30.130
We're not gonna make it, Carlos.

03:30.422 --> 03:32.255
Sure, we've got plenty of time.

03:41.297 --> 03:43.005
Come on, hup two!

03:46.047 --> 03:47.213
I,

03:49.172 --> 03:50.672
Fernando,

03:51.547 --> 03:53.755
take you, Isabel,

03:53.922 --> 03:55.463
to be my wife.

03:56.172 --> 03:59.505
I give myself to you,
and I promise to be faithful,

03:59.672 --> 04:01.755
through good times and bad,

04:01.922 --> 04:02.922
Your tie!

04:03.088 --> 04:06.088
In sickness and in health,
every day of my life,

04:06.255 --> 04:08.047
until death do us part.

04:09.297 --> 04:11.505
I, Isabel,

04:12.505 --> 04:15.463
take you, Fernando,

04:15.630 --> 04:20.130
to be my husband...
I give myself to you...

04:20.755 --> 04:23.463
and I promise to be faithful...

04:23.630 --> 04:27.088
in sickness and in health,

04:27.755 --> 04:29.380
every day of my life...

04:30.130 --> 04:32.005
until death do us part.

04:33.630 --> 04:38.422
If anyone here present
objects to this union,

04:38.588 --> 04:41.463
speak now or forever hold your peace.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.255
In the name of our Lord,

04:46.255 --> 04:48.088
I pronounce you husband and wife.

04:51.755 --> 04:54.047
You may kiss the bride.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.505
No!

05:08.588 --> 05:09.213
No what?

05:09.672 --> 05:10.463
No...

05:12.838 --> 05:14.047
What happened?

05:15.213 --> 05:16.380
Fuck!

05:17.297 --> 05:18.005
I knew it!

05:20.380 --> 05:21.963
<i>Goal for Barcelona!</i>

05:25.797 --> 05:27.255
You're beyond repair.

05:27.422 --> 05:29.213
What kind of moron does that?

05:29.380 --> 05:32.880
Setting a wedding date
on the day of the Cup Final!

05:33.047 --> 05:35.797
My nephew planned it a year ago.
He didn't know.

05:35.963 --> 05:37.213
Everyone knows that!

05:38.005 --> 05:38.922
Come here!

05:40.255 --> 05:42.213
- What was the score?
-0-1.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.588
- Who scored?
- The midget.

05:44.755 --> 05:47.547
Messi! Jesus Fucking Christ!

05:52.422 --> 05:54.588
- Where's the rice?
- What rice?

05:54.755 --> 05:55.588
The rice!

05:55.755 --> 05:59.547
I called earlier and
your husband said you'd bring it.

06:01.297 --> 06:02.547
Tell me that's not true,

06:03.005 --> 06:03.797
Carlos...

06:03.963 --> 06:08.130
Long live the bride and groom!

06:15.963 --> 06:18.505
OK, everyone eyes over here.

06:18.672 --> 06:20.963
Squeeze in on the end there.

06:27.047 --> 06:28.755
Listen up!

06:29.630 --> 06:31.213
Cousin Carmen!

06:32.255 --> 06:35.213
- Hello, Pepe.
- Beautiful! Just like Madonna.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.588
What's that about Maradona, jerkoff?

06:37.755 --> 06:40.797
Busting my balls over Barça?
Douchebag! I'll kick your ass!

06:42.213 --> 06:43.338
Watch it!

06:43.672 --> 06:45.255
Time for the picture.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.838
Everyone, say "cheese!"

06:48.255 --> 06:49.880
Cheese!

06:50.047 --> 06:52.047
- This time with feeling!
- Cheese!

07:25.380 --> 07:26.880
Carlos, Carlos!

07:27.088 --> 07:28.422
Let's dance?

07:28.588 --> 07:32.047
Look! That skirt is so short,
her ass is hanging out.

07:32.213 --> 07:33.630
For Christ's sake.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.338
She's at that age.

07:52.755 --> 07:55.213
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:56.380 --> 07:59.422
tonight it is my pleasure to introduce

07:59.963 --> 08:04.463
a hypnosis show
like no other in the world

08:04.963 --> 08:08.380
that will open a door to the beyond,

08:08.672 --> 08:11.255
to the fourth dimension.

08:12.213 --> 08:13.672
I give you,

08:13.963 --> 08:17.713
the one and only

08:18.463 --> 08:21.422
Peter Strauss.

08:23.838 --> 08:27.297
- Could he get any dumber?
- Carlos, please!

08:45.047 --> 08:47.172
Good evening. Welcome.

08:48.047 --> 08:51.463
Congratulations to the bride and groom.

08:54.297 --> 08:55.213
Thank you.

08:56.088 --> 09:00.088
For my first act of hypnosis
this evening,

09:00.255 --> 09:03.005
I'll need the help of a volunteer.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.130
Is there a volunteer in the audience?

09:12.838 --> 09:13.713
Just one.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.963
Don't all stand up at once.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.005
Not you, Mom.
They'll think it's faked.

09:27.255 --> 09:28.630
It's alright.

09:34.755 --> 09:37.213
Any other volunteer?

09:38.630 --> 09:41.213
No round of applause
for the volunteer?

09:46.755 --> 09:48.088
Welcome.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.797
Can you please tell us your name?

09:51.963 --> 09:54.005
Cut the crap, Peter Strauss.

09:54.172 --> 09:57.172
OK, "Mr. Cut-the-crap", please...

09:57.797 --> 09:58.963
take a seat.

10:06.588 --> 10:10.755
Keep a close eye on my hand
and focus on my finger.

10:13.088 --> 10:18.130
Gradually, you'll start to feel
your eyelids getting heavy.

10:19.547 --> 10:21.547
Your eyes feel heavy.

10:22.838 --> 10:26.338
You're getting very, very sleepy.

10:27.422 --> 10:28.338
One...

10:29.338 --> 10:30.380
two...

10:30.755 --> 10:31.505
three...

10:31.672 --> 10:32.588
Sleep.

10:35.463 --> 10:39.088
You start going down
an endless escalator

10:39.255 --> 10:43.047
which will take you
to the depths of your own mind.

10:44.422 --> 10:46.463
Ten... nine...

10:47.338 --> 10:49.505
eight... seven...

10:50.172 --> 10:51.380
deeper...

10:51.713 --> 10:54.255
six... five...

10:55.047 --> 10:57.005
four... three...

10:57.672 --> 10:59.922
deeper and deeper...

11:00.297 --> 11:01.088
two...

11:01.588 --> 11:02.422
one...

11:02.588 --> 11:03.297
zero.

11:04.047 --> 11:08.213
The lights come on
and you're in a white world.

11:08.963 --> 11:11.630
Endless and white.

11:14.880 --> 11:18.130
Good. You're now under my control.

11:24.713 --> 11:27.130
When I say the word "Abracadabra",

11:27.297 --> 11:31.463
you will open your eyes
and do everything I tell you.

11:32.463 --> 11:34.130
I am your master.

11:40.880 --> 11:41.797
Abracadabra.

11:47.713 --> 11:48.922
Abracadabra!

11:54.713 --> 11:56.088
Stand up.

12:00.463 --> 12:01.630
Take two steps.

12:07.713 --> 12:10.130
Eat this delicious apple.

12:17.255 --> 12:19.422
Eat my dick!

12:21.672 --> 12:23.922
What a dope!

12:36.547 --> 12:37.880
You took it too far.

12:39.713 --> 12:41.547
No, it's fine.

12:42.005 --> 12:45.547
Sadly, tiny brains
like "Mr. Cut-the-crap's"

12:45.713 --> 12:48.130
don't allow themselves
to be hypnotized.

12:48.297 --> 12:50.505
The show must go on,

12:50.672 --> 12:52.463
so I need another volunteer.

12:55.338 --> 12:56.880
Any volunteer?

13:07.213 --> 13:08.547
How do you turn it off?

13:12.672 --> 13:15.672
Quit dicking around, Carlos!

13:18.130 --> 13:19.588
Any other volunteer?

13:20.713 --> 13:22.297
Mom, you want to come up now?

13:24.672 --> 13:26.672
Where are you going?

13:31.838 --> 13:34.713
Once again, "Mr. Cut-the-crap".

13:38.505 --> 13:40.088
What are you doing, man?

13:43.588 --> 13:45.463
- You're hurting me!
- Carlos!

13:46.088 --> 13:47.213
Carlos, let him go!

13:48.255 --> 13:49.088
Now!

13:58.213 --> 13:59.422
Who are you?

14:14.672 --> 14:15.922
It was a joke.

14:16.547 --> 14:18.047
I didn't find it funny.

14:18.297 --> 14:20.922
Don't get like that over a joke.

14:25.297 --> 14:27.755
Someone needs to teach
that fraud a lesson,

14:27.922 --> 14:30.672
just for the way he looks at you!
He undresses you!

14:32.505 --> 14:35.172
Do you ever look at me?

14:37.380 --> 14:39.213
Do you look at me, Carlos?

14:40.797 --> 14:42.255
Of course I do.

15:10.797 --> 15:12.213
Good morning.

15:20.088 --> 15:21.963
Why didn't you wake me up?

15:22.130 --> 15:23.797
I wanted to let you rest.

15:29.088 --> 15:30.213
What is that?

15:32.463 --> 15:33.463
Your breakfast.

15:39.213 --> 15:43.505
You know...
I'm still really mad at you.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.047
Do you want it here
or in the living room?

16:32.255 --> 16:35.255
Pepe, I need to see you.
There's a problem.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.838
Carlos is acting really weird.

16:39.880 --> 16:43.130
You wouldn't believe me,
if I told you. I swear.

17:13.922 --> 17:18.505
Alfalfa, Renata, Goliath.
Suspect is a white female,

17:18.672 --> 17:22.005
redhead, in Frozen Foods.
Send back-up.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.380
Alfalfa, Renata, Goliath. Mayday!

17:32.213 --> 17:35.630
Christ almighty, you scared me!
I'm working.

17:54.130 --> 17:55.172
Stick with me.

17:56.297 --> 17:59.630
Pepe, I want you to tell me the truth.

18:00.088 --> 18:02.838
Did you know
what you were doing to my Carlos?

18:06.713 --> 18:09.338
We have to go see
my teacher, Dr. Fumetti.

18:11.922 --> 18:14.255
<i>Pepe, where the fuck are you?</i>

18:14.422 --> 18:15.672
I'll call you later.

18:45.588 --> 18:47.505
Three, two, one... wake up!

18:53.922 --> 18:58.172
You saw it with your own eyes.
Pain doesn't exist.

18:59.088 --> 19:02.588
It is all in the mind.

19:02.963 --> 19:03.588
See?

19:04.922 --> 19:08.755
Give this couple a round of applause
for taking part

19:08.922 --> 19:11.713
in this extraordinary experiment.

19:27.588 --> 19:30.130
Your case interests me
for two reasons:

19:30.880 --> 19:33.755
Pepe here is an outstanding
student of mine,

19:35.047 --> 19:38.922
and because Rasputin Lomax,
my mentor and friend,

19:39.088 --> 19:41.130
would've done the same for me.

19:43.838 --> 19:47.005
Bring your husband
to my office tomorrow.

19:49.172 --> 19:53.505
But don't tell him
the reason for your visit.

19:54.047 --> 19:54.963
Of course.

20:04.297 --> 20:08.213
You're fine paying, right?
I left my wallet upstairs.

20:08.588 --> 20:10.797
Sure. You got any cash?

20:17.838 --> 20:19.922
I had to come today?

20:22.172 --> 20:24.463
It had to happen sometime.

20:29.922 --> 20:32.130
- Carlos López?
- Yes.

20:32.630 --> 20:34.963
The doctor will see you now.

20:36.463 --> 20:39.797
- Where are you going, Carmen?
- I'll come in with you.

20:42.922 --> 20:44.422
Open your mouth.

20:44.713 --> 20:45.713
Wider!

20:47.880 --> 20:49.588
Let's see those cavities.

20:50.255 --> 20:54.130
Lower right: 9, 6...

20:54.797 --> 20:58.713
Lower left: 8, 6, 5...

20:59.797 --> 21:01.172
Upper right:

21:01.963 --> 21:05.963
9, 7, 6, 5...

21:07.380 --> 21:10.505
When was the last time
you saw a dentist?

21:10.672 --> 21:12.505
When we got married.

21:13.088 --> 21:14.797
21 years ago.

21:16.338 --> 21:19.588
But I never get toothaches.
An occasional twinge...

21:20.588 --> 21:24.255
Rosario, we're going to need "The Rack".

21:35.047 --> 21:37.505
Have you ever hear
of mental anesthesia?

21:38.922 --> 21:43.463
Mental anesthesia
is a telekinetic, sensory state

21:44.672 --> 21:50.255
that allows us to operate without
using traditional anesthesia.

21:55.630 --> 21:57.755
It's for your own safety.

22:01.005 --> 22:04.505
Now, look into that light.

22:13.338 --> 22:14.922
If you don't relax,

22:15.672 --> 22:17.672
this will hurt a teeny bit.

22:25.422 --> 22:26.463
Now...

22:26.963 --> 22:28.880
Feel my hand.

22:30.297 --> 22:32.963
Your eyelids feel heavy,

22:33.672 --> 22:35.880
your body feels heavy,

22:36.630 --> 22:40.672
you are overcome
by a very pleasant deep sleep.

22:48.713 --> 22:51.047
When I count three, two, one,

22:51.213 --> 22:54.588
if there is someone inside you,
please, show yourself

22:55.130 --> 22:57.088
and answer my questions.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.130
Three... two... one...
0pen your eyes.

23:05.755 --> 23:07.172
What is your name?

23:09.963 --> 23:11.422
Sorry. Hold on...

23:16.755 --> 23:17.713
Tito.

23:20.213 --> 23:21.755
It's short for Alberto.

23:22.838 --> 23:24.588
How old are you?

23:26.088 --> 23:27.172
28.

23:27.713 --> 23:29.338
What year is this?

23:30.880 --> 23:32.838
1983.

23:34.547 --> 23:36.005
Where do you live?

23:37.547 --> 23:41.922
In Carabanchel.
7 Colón Street. Apartment 3-D.

23:42.630 --> 23:44.172
Why all the questions?

23:52.005 --> 23:53.422
I know you.

24:10.547 --> 24:14.380
Your husband is an extrasensory being.

24:14.838 --> 24:19.130
He's like a parabolic antenna
that attracts suffering spirits.

24:19.297 --> 24:24.005
Right now, one called Alberto
has taken refuge in him.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.922
We have to get him out of there fast.

24:27.088 --> 24:29.005
If we don't, gradually,

24:29.255 --> 24:32.922
the spirit will take over
your husband's entire being.

24:34.338 --> 24:37.172
- So what can we do?
- Well...

24:37.338 --> 24:39.672
I could expel the intruder,

24:40.380 --> 24:45.338
but I'll need a personal item
from the specter.

24:46.547 --> 24:48.588
- Get it for me.
- Yes...

24:48.755 --> 24:53.130
Don't tell your husband anything.
That could be fatal.

24:54.380 --> 24:58.505
How do I know if the man I'm with
is my husband or the other guy?

25:02.422 --> 25:03.797
I'll figure it out.

25:11.047 --> 25:13.755
That guy really does
have a magic touch.

25:14.130 --> 25:15.672
It didn't hurt for shit.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.797
He's just like Camilo.

25:35.088 --> 25:37.797
- Who?
- Who else? Camilo Sesto.

25:47.088 --> 25:51.422
Tasty! I was starving.
And this omelet is... Wow!

25:51.713 --> 25:54.630
But you only like Grandma's omelet.

25:57.588 --> 26:00.505
No! I'll clear.

26:06.463 --> 26:08.755
Dad is acting really weird.

26:09.713 --> 26:11.630
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

26:12.755 --> 26:14.255
It must be the weather.

26:34.922 --> 26:37.505
How come you're on my side of the bed?

27:37.047 --> 27:40.088
This morning, your husband
bought me coffee and gave me a hug.

27:43.797 --> 27:46.713
And you're complaining already?

27:49.297 --> 27:52.380
He does the laundry,
the dishes, he vacuums,

27:52.547 --> 27:54.297
he doesn't snore, he's kind...

27:54.463 --> 27:56.755
You should be thanking me.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.838
I don't understand you.

28:01.338 --> 28:05.297
MY PARADISE APARTMENTS
NEW DEVEL0PMENT

28:06.213 --> 28:08.463
Come on, Carlos, we're waiting.

28:11.547 --> 28:12.963
<i>Today would be nice!</i>

28:14.505 --> 28:15.672
<i>Let's go!</i>

28:16.505 --> 28:18.255
<i>Is he asleep up there?</i>

28:18.588 --> 28:19.505
<i>Move your ass!</i>

28:25.130 --> 28:29.047
<i>What the fuck?
It's not fucking raining!</i>

28:36.255 --> 28:37.797
Where are you going?

28:38.797 --> 28:40.255
<i>Over here!</i>

28:41.713 --> 28:44.463
<i>Stop, stop! Fucking hell! Stop!</i>

28:44.713 --> 28:45.797
<i>What are you doing?</i>

28:46.630 --> 28:48.338
<i>Bring it over here.</i>

28:49.672 --> 28:51.963
That's it. Nice and slow.

28:52.130 --> 28:52.880
<i>Gentle.</i>

28:56.380 --> 28:57.797
<i>Slowly...</i>

28:58.630 --> 29:01.838
Slow! Holy shit! Stop!
Stop! Fuck!

29:03.047 --> 29:04.838
<i>Carlos, stop!</i>

29:11.672 --> 29:15.422
What's wrong with you, you moron?
Are you trying to kill us?

29:24.088 --> 29:25.963
Do you have the spirit's address?

29:26.963 --> 29:28.422
Number seven...

29:29.672 --> 29:32.088
It could be that one...

29:33.838 --> 29:34.797
over there.

29:35.255 --> 29:36.338
This is it.

29:36.672 --> 29:37.547
Let's see...

29:38.297 --> 29:39.338
Three.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.672
Hello?

30:02.880 --> 30:06.547
Carmen, this is breaking
and entering! Fuck!

30:07.797 --> 30:09.422
Excuse me? Hello?

30:10.380 --> 30:12.047
- Please come in.
- Hello.

30:12.672 --> 30:16.338
Please come in.
Make yourselves at home.

30:22.130 --> 30:24.255
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

30:24.422 --> 30:26.422
We love decorating.

30:26.588 --> 30:29.380
We're very modern.

30:32.588 --> 30:34.422
How about some music?

30:38.672 --> 30:41.047
It's Kenny G. The latest album.

30:44.297 --> 30:46.755
- We're sorry to intrude...
- It's fine.

30:47.755 --> 30:49.422
- We'd like to talk to...
- Yes,

30:49.588 --> 30:53.463
we want to talk, too.
And find out who you are

30:54.130 --> 30:55.297
and why you're here.

30:56.880 --> 30:57.630
Well...

30:57.797 --> 30:58.672
Cranberry juice?

30:58.838 --> 31:00.588
- Yes.
- No, we're in a hurry.

31:00.755 --> 31:03.172
In a hurry? Please...

31:03.422 --> 31:07.380
Let me show you something.
Come...

31:07.588 --> 31:08.963
We're looking for...

31:09.130 --> 31:11.838
- Later.
-...someone who lived here...

31:12.005 --> 31:13.463
You have to see this.

31:13.630 --> 31:15.297
Pepe. Pepe!

31:16.838 --> 31:17.880
Bye, darling.

31:20.797 --> 31:23.380
Delicious! Did you make them?

31:23.547 --> 31:24.797
- So...
- Really?

31:30.672 --> 31:32.130
Our masterpiece.

31:33.422 --> 31:35.338
An exact replica.

31:37.005 --> 31:40.172
The mattress,
100*/* memory foam.

31:41.380 --> 31:44.172
- Want to try it?
- No, thanks.

31:44.338 --> 31:46.630
Try, it feels so good.

31:48.255 --> 31:49.755
I was wondering...

31:49.922 --> 31:53.005
How old I am?
What's your guess?

31:54.172 --> 31:58.047
24? 32?
You're not sure.

31:58.338 --> 32:00.463
SWINGING.
WHAT ARE Y0U WAITING FOR?

32:01.047 --> 32:04.505
I'm actually 50.
I know I don't look it.

32:04.672 --> 32:05.838
It says it here.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.088
Pepe, this is 9 Colón Street!

32:13.547 --> 32:15.463
We've got the wrong address.

32:15.630 --> 32:16.630
Pepe?

32:23.838 --> 32:25.297
That cocktease!

32:36.380 --> 32:40.338
They redid the numbers.
Number 7 is now 5. Unbelievable.

32:45.088 --> 32:47.838
What? I felt sorry for her.

32:51.755 --> 32:53.130
FOR SALE

32:54.130 --> 32:55.213
That's the one.

32:56.463 --> 32:58.213
We have to call.

34:17.047 --> 34:19.338
Shit, Dad! You scared me.

34:19.505 --> 34:22.797
Go on, let me study.
I've got a test tomorrow.

34:23.380 --> 34:24.505
Can I help?

34:27.005 --> 34:30.213
Dad, you don't know shit,
gimme a break.

34:35.797 --> 34:39.005
Forget Pythagoras,
you don't need to calculate

34:39.172 --> 34:43.172
that the square of the hypotenuse is
equal to the square of the twosides.

34:43.338 --> 34:46.422
Simply apply geometry to the math.

34:46.588 --> 34:51.255
The area of a hexagon is
the same as the six triangles,

34:51.422 --> 34:53.755
We've got the triangle's base
and the apothem,

34:53.922 --> 34:55.588
so use that and multiply by six.

34:56.838 --> 34:59.172
Now I get it!

34:59.338 --> 35:01.922
You explain it better than the teacher.

35:03.922 --> 35:05.005
Dinner's ready!

35:05.505 --> 35:06.380
OK.

35:06.547 --> 35:09.047
You should put some clothes on.

35:10.255 --> 35:12.505
So you don't catch cold.

35:19.672 --> 35:21.547
This is delicious fish.

35:26.422 --> 35:29.547
- Toñi, you have to eat.
- I'm not hungry.

35:30.005 --> 35:33.505
You'll end up an anorexic mess,
like your cousin Sandra.

35:38.505 --> 35:40.672
You got a lot of tests this week?

35:42.255 --> 35:45.505
On Friday I have one
on chemical compounds.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.713
Organic or inorganic?

35:49.880 --> 35:51.630
Can we study together?

35:52.088 --> 35:54.255
Sure, but you gotta eat.

35:58.588 --> 36:00.380
Have some ham, sweetie.

36:01.422 --> 36:02.880
That's the way.

36:49.380 --> 36:50.922
Watch out, it's scalding.

36:56.755 --> 36:59.255
Where were you last night, Carlos?

37:00.255 --> 37:01.130
What?

37:03.005 --> 37:03.963
Where?

37:04.172 --> 37:07.797
Where do you think, Carmen?
Here. What a question!

37:11.922 --> 37:15.130
What are you doing?
Since when do I drink chocolate milk?

37:16.838 --> 37:17.755
Since yesterday.

37:17.922 --> 37:20.630
Don't get smart with me

37:20.797 --> 37:22.422
or I'll do it.

37:24.005 --> 37:28.297
Dad, what's the difference between
arithmetic progression and sequences?

37:28.463 --> 37:29.422
Fuck!

37:29.588 --> 37:32.047
Are you both fucking with me?

37:32.213 --> 37:35.047
Where's my lunch?
My sandwich!

37:56.505 --> 37:59.088
AFTERLIFE

38:14.172 --> 38:16.422
Zizu, give me a coffee with <i>churros.</i>

38:16.588 --> 38:20.588
I can do you a coffee,
but that guy had the last <i>churros.</i>

38:20.755 --> 38:24.422
Hey, cousin.
I didn't see you come in.

38:24.588 --> 38:28.505
You want chocolate milk?
one chocolate milk. My treat.

38:29.672 --> 38:32.213
You think I'm some kind of asshole?

38:36.213 --> 38:39.963
- Are you waiting for my wife?
- I'm not waiting for anyone.

38:40.255 --> 38:42.505
Are you waiting for my wife?

38:42.672 --> 38:44.588
I'm not lying.

38:45.172 --> 38:47.130
Don't lie to me.
I'll kill you.

38:48.338 --> 38:51.130
Wait! Watch my finger.

38:52.755 --> 38:54.547
Keep your eyes on it because...

38:56.172 --> 38:57.672
you're gradually going to...

38:58.588 --> 39:02.713
If you go near my wife again,
I'll cut your balls off!

39:14.838 --> 39:17.297
Your husband is an animal.
A brute.

39:17.797 --> 39:20.005
And you know that better than anyone.

39:20.172 --> 39:21.005
Just drop it!

39:26.505 --> 39:28.672
You're bent out of shape with me now?

39:30.547 --> 39:34.672
Hi. I'm Pedro Luis Vivancos,
real estate agent.

39:34.838 --> 39:35.797
Carmen?

39:36.380 --> 39:39.213
- And you must be her husband.
- Yes, sir.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.838
- Ready?
- Sure.

39:52.172 --> 39:54.505
We haven't shown it in ages.

39:59.505 --> 40:00.505
Come in.

40:07.880 --> 40:13.338
The apartment
is almost 1,000 square feet.

40:16.755 --> 40:18.338
This is the kitchen,

40:19.463 --> 40:20.713
it's quite large.

40:26.505 --> 40:29.463
As you can see,
it's in mint condition.

40:30.213 --> 40:33.047
The cabinets are made of beech.

40:36.505 --> 40:40.588
The bathroom
is about 48 square feet.

40:44.463 --> 40:47.755
It's finished
with ceramic tile and marble.

40:49.755 --> 40:51.547
The bidet has a waterjet.

40:51.713 --> 40:54.422
I love those. They're great.

40:58.797 --> 41:01.130
This is the master bedroom.

41:14.255 --> 41:15.880
Feel free to look around.

41:49.547 --> 41:52.005
Load-bearing wall.
Can't be removed.

41:54.088 --> 41:58.047
This is the place for you.
I'll let you have it very cheap.

41:58.755 --> 42:00.797
It's been on the market for years.

42:00.963 --> 42:05.463
Not because it's in poor condition,
it passed all the inspections.

42:05.630 --> 42:07.380
Why has it never sold?

42:10.797 --> 42:12.213
Can you keep a secret?

42:20.588 --> 42:23.088
This house...
was the scene of a murder.

42:25.380 --> 42:27.963
It all happened in the dining room.

42:37.672 --> 42:38.672
This way.

42:46.005 --> 42:48.672
A mother and her son lived here.

42:49.380 --> 42:53.005
He was schizophrenic,
but he stopped taking his medicine

42:53.172 --> 42:55.380
because he was dating a girl.

42:56.172 --> 42:59.380
His mother never approved
of the relationship.

42:59.547 --> 43:04.047
Rumor had it that the mother
and son were sleeping together.

43:05.838 --> 43:06.838
One day,

43:07.755 --> 43:09.130
at lunchtime,

43:25.547 --> 43:29.922
the son was carving a chicken
with an electric knife,

43:42.255 --> 43:44.255
when the squabbling began.

43:44.672 --> 43:47.672
"You did this, you did that..."

43:47.838 --> 43:51.463
-"Don't talk to Mommy like that!"
-"Stop controlling my life!"

43:51.630 --> 43:54.297
-"Please take your medication!"
-"I don't want to!"

43:56.047 --> 43:58.463
Then the son stood up

43:59.255 --> 44:00.588
and pounced on his mother.

44:09.797 --> 44:12.838
He grabbed her neck with one hand...
and with the other...

44:32.213 --> 44:35.838
He cut her head off!
Blood squirting everywhere!

44:43.297 --> 44:45.588
They never found the head.

44:47.047 --> 44:49.547
It was a famous murder in the 80s.

44:51.588 --> 44:54.005
Don't worry about the bloodstains.

44:54.172 --> 44:57.880
A couple of coats of paint
will hide those.

44:58.713 --> 45:02.755
And the bedroom...
The son's bedroom?

45:08.380 --> 45:10.547
Look around as much as you like.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.172
Carmen, just take something
and let's go!

46:02.338 --> 46:03.380
What should I take?

46:03.547 --> 46:05.755
Dr. Fumetti said something personal.

46:07.380 --> 46:09.130
Hurry up, Carmen!

46:10.880 --> 46:14.588
- Hurry up! He's coming!
- Pepe, don't make me nervous.

46:14.755 --> 46:17.422
Hurry up! Let's go!

46:22.130 --> 46:25.963
Take me to your gynecologist
so I can suck his finger!

46:26.672 --> 46:28.922
Nice try, Celes,
no chance you're fucking her!

47:27.505 --> 47:30.088
- Rogelio. Rogelio!
<i>- What is it?</i>

47:30.255 --> 47:32.005
There's a monkey on the crane!

47:32.963 --> 47:34.005
What?

47:34.172 --> 47:35.797
<i>You heard me!
A monkey.</i>

47:35.963 --> 47:37.422
A fucking chimpanzee!

47:37.588 --> 47:39.963
How could there be a monkey?

47:40.130 --> 47:43.422
Maybe it escaped from the zoo.
It stole my sandwich.

47:45.547 --> 47:49.755
Can you see it, Rogelio?
The fucker is right here!

47:49.922 --> 47:51.255
No! I don't see nothing!

47:51.422 --> 47:53.297
Right here on the cab!

47:54.880 --> 47:55.922
<i>Carlos!</i>

47:56.797 --> 47:57.922
Motherfucker!

47:58.088 --> 47:58.963
Come down right now!

47:59.547 --> 48:02.088
- What's going on?
- Carlos, you're going to kill yourself!

48:02.255 --> 48:05.547
Gimme my sandwich!
Look! I can be a monkey too.

48:06.672 --> 48:08.630
I'm in charge here, asshole.

48:11.297 --> 48:15.338
Look!
Check me out on the jungle gym!

48:16.088 --> 48:17.588
What the...

48:23.338 --> 48:26.963
Come here!
Give me back my sandwich.

48:27.130 --> 48:29.422
That's my sandwich, motherfucker!

49:24.088 --> 49:25.422
Don't come in tomorrow.

49:25.588 --> 49:28.380
Take a few days off.
I'll call you.

49:32.547 --> 49:34.838
We could put this on YouTube.

49:36.630 --> 49:38.547
Go on, back to work!

49:44.005 --> 49:48.255
Dr. Fumetti?
Yes, we've got it.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.130
Tomorrow?

49:54.838 --> 49:56.047
Today. Today.

49:57.338 --> 49:58.963
Can't it be today?

50:01.213 --> 50:02.963
OK.

50:03.922 --> 50:07.047
See you tomorrow.
Goodbye, <i>maestro.</i>

50:08.380 --> 50:11.047
- We should call the police.
- Great idea!

50:11.213 --> 50:15.047
To tell them the spirit of a murderer
has possessed your husband?

50:40.088 --> 50:41.755
Why are you home so early?

50:50.047 --> 50:51.922
What's wrong, Carlos?

50:53.047 --> 50:53.713
Where's Toñi?

50:59.963 --> 51:01.547
Where's Toñi?

51:02.422 --> 51:06.088
Toñi! Sweetheart! Toñi!

51:06.463 --> 51:09.297
Mom! What is it?

51:10.630 --> 51:13.463
You're going to stay with your aunt!

51:13.630 --> 51:15.630
- Why?
- Because I say so. End of story.

51:15.797 --> 51:17.797
- But...
- Shush! No arguments.

51:24.588 --> 51:27.380
I swear I saw the monkey.

51:28.047 --> 51:29.588
I believe you.

51:30.172 --> 51:33.380
I'm not crazy. I'm not crazy.

51:33.672 --> 51:36.047
Of course you're not, honey.

51:39.130 --> 51:41.255
Then what's happening to me?

51:43.213 --> 51:44.797
Look at you two!

51:46.213 --> 51:50.213
You're pathetic.
Are you getting a divorce?

51:58.755 --> 52:00.588
I don't even care!

53:25.713 --> 53:26.630
There...

53:45.297 --> 53:46.088
Keep the change.

53:46.255 --> 53:48.922
Let me give you some advice, ma'am.

53:49.922 --> 53:53.463
If you find out he's cheating,
take justice into your own hands,

53:54.213 --> 53:55.880
like <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

53:56.588 --> 53:57.213
Look.

54:02.213 --> 54:03.838
I can loan it to you.

54:04.338 --> 54:07.588
Pretty realistic, huh?
It's only a toy!

54:10.338 --> 54:11.463
Lady!

54:11.630 --> 54:16.088
You're a stunner.
You'll soon find another macho man.

59:38.172 --> 59:39.088
Hello?

59:39.255 --> 59:41.630
<i>Carmen, you need to see this.</i>

59:42.463 --> 59:45.297
- What is it?
<i>- I'll tell you when you get here.</i>

59:45.588 --> 59:46.672
Where?

1:00:12.922 --> 1:00:15.838
THE WEEKLY REPORT

1:00:17.172 --> 1:00:20.088
THE CARABANCHEL SLAUGHTER
<i>Mental patient or murderer?</i>

1:00:20.255 --> 1:00:23.922
<i>The slaughter in Carabanchel
has reignited the debate</i>

1:00:24.088 --> 1:00:27.338
<i>about the treatment
of schizophrenia in our country.</i>

1:00:29.547 --> 1:00:32.088
<i>On December 21st,</i>

1:00:32.255 --> 1:00:35.088
<i>at his home in Carabanchel,</i>

1:00:35.255 --> 1:00:38.422
<i>Alberto Cantero, aged 28,</i>

1:00:38.588 --> 1:00:41.797
<i>slit the throat of his mother,
60 year-old Encarnación Rojas,</i>

1:00:41.963 --> 1:00:45.755
<i>with an electric knife,
completely severing her head.</i>

1:00:47.047 --> 1:00:50.713
<i>The killer then went to "La Noria",
a wedding banquet venue</i>

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:52.672
<i>where he worked as a waiter.</i>

1:00:53.880 --> 1:00:56.838
We were there for my nephew's wedding!

1:00:57.005 --> 1:01:00.172
I know.
That's why I called you.

1:01:00.630 --> 1:01:04.463
<i>Once inside,
he used a large kitchen knife</i>

1:01:04.630 --> 1:01:08.797
<i>to attack several guests
at the banquet being held there,</i>

1:01:08.963 --> 1:01:13.130
<i>killing seven
and seriously injuring three others.</i>

1:01:14.088 --> 1:01:18.630
<i>Moments later,
Alberto Cantero took his own life.</i>

1:01:19.297 --> 1:01:22.213
<i>We have obtained
video footage that was filmed</i>

1:01:22.380 --> 1:01:24.713
<i>by one of the victims that day.</i>

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:29.213
WARNING. <i>Some viewers may find</i>
<i>the following images disturbing.</i>

1:03:34.130 --> 1:03:36.172
How could you show me this?

1:04:19.755 --> 1:04:22.422
Peter, I told you to give me time.

1:04:22.588 --> 1:04:26.172
- I'm risking everything here.
- I know, but we had no choice.

1:04:27.005 --> 1:04:29.755
- What are we doing here?
- Who knows, go with it!

1:04:37.213 --> 1:04:39.047
- Where's the envelope?
- The envelope.

1:04:49.755 --> 1:04:51.755
You'll have to put these on.

1:05:15.672 --> 1:05:17.505
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

1:05:23.505 --> 1:05:26.005
We're gonna go all out tonight!

1:05:28.963 --> 1:05:31.338
Three cheers for the bride!

1:05:31.505 --> 1:05:32.672
Hip hip...

1:05:32.838 --> 1:05:34.547
hooray!

1:05:34.713 --> 1:05:38.047
- Three cheers for the bride!
- Hip hip hooray!

1:06:14.755 --> 1:06:15.713
Which one?

1:06:16.630 --> 1:06:17.547
What?

1:06:17.713 --> 1:06:19.838
Choose one. Come on!

1:06:21.338 --> 1:06:22.505
- Either?
- One.

1:06:22.755 --> 1:06:23.755
Pepe...

1:06:30.713 --> 1:06:33.588
Eeny, meeny, miny, Moe,
Catch a tiger by the toe.

1:06:33.755 --> 1:06:36.588
If he hollers, let him go,
Eeny, meeny, miny, Moe.

1:06:37.547 --> 1:06:38.963
That one.

1:06:45.755 --> 1:06:47.505
"Mariano Cañadas."

1:06:48.547 --> 1:06:50.797
"Bronchogenic carcinoma."

1:06:55.630 --> 1:06:56.672
He's at death's door.

1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:59.297
Come closer.

1:07:02.380 --> 1:07:05.047
- Your husband's belonging?
- He's not my husband!

1:07:05.213 --> 1:07:07.297
- Whatever! Where is it?
- Do you have it?

1:07:07.463 --> 1:07:08.880
Give it to him.

1:07:14.922 --> 1:07:19.172
- What the hell is that?
- What does it look like?

1:07:19.338 --> 1:07:21.672
- Now put them on Mariano.
- What?

1:07:21.838 --> 1:07:23.505
We don't have much time!

1:07:26.463 --> 1:07:28.213
- He's got a diaper on!
- Take it off.

1:07:28.672 --> 1:07:31.755
The item belonging to the spirit

1:07:31.922 --> 1:07:35.630
must be in direct contact
with the medium or it won't work.

1:07:40.672 --> 1:07:41.588
0h, my God!

1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:45.547
Clean him up.

1:07:45.713 --> 1:07:49.213
No! You're the one
whose husband is possessed.

1:07:49.380 --> 1:07:53.005
Really?
And whose fault was that?

1:07:53.213 --> 1:07:53.963
Hurry up!

1:07:54.130 --> 1:07:56.755
0K, but you take the diaper off.

1:08:03.672 --> 1:08:04.672
Done.

1:08:06.755 --> 1:08:09.380
- Now what?
- It's very simple.

1:08:09.838 --> 1:08:14.172
Mariano already has one foot
in the grave. He's the living dead.

1:08:14.338 --> 1:08:16.338
A superconductor.

1:08:17.213 --> 1:08:19.463
An intercom to the afterlife.

1:08:54.505 --> 1:08:56.005
Alberto, are you there?

1:08:57.797 --> 1:08:59.838
Alberto, can you hear me?

1:09:07.297 --> 1:09:09.755
Alberto, if you're there,
give me a sign.

1:09:12.172 --> 1:09:13.047
<i>Alberto?</i>

1:09:14.797 --> 1:09:16.047
<i>Albertito?</i>

1:09:18.213 --> 1:09:19.422
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1:09:19.797 --> 1:09:20.838
<i>Tito.</i>

1:09:21.005 --> 1:09:22.255
- Shit!
- Fucking hell!

1:09:27.797 --> 1:09:29.088
Alberto, is that you?

1:09:31.547 --> 1:09:32.297
What?

1:09:33.463 --> 1:09:34.547
Is that you?

1:09:35.255 --> 1:09:36.672
Yes, it's me.

1:09:38.338 --> 1:09:40.588
You're the dentist!

1:09:40.838 --> 1:09:42.630
I'm Dr. Fumetti.

1:09:42.963 --> 1:09:45.880
How long are you
going to be among us?

1:09:46.047 --> 1:09:49.505
- What do you mean?
- When will you leave Carlos's body?

1:09:49.963 --> 1:09:52.255
Oh, that. When I die.

1:09:52.755 --> 1:09:55.172
<i>But you're already long dead!</i>

1:09:56.047 --> 1:09:57.922
Alberto, you have to leave.

1:09:59.172 --> 1:10:00.838
You have to go!

1:10:01.838 --> 1:10:04.588
Carmen, sweetheart.
What are you doing here?

1:10:06.213 --> 1:10:09.172
Alberto, I'm begging you,

1:10:09.838 --> 1:10:11.880
you have to leave my husband.

1:10:13.297 --> 1:10:15.588
You have to go back to your world.

1:10:16.380 --> 1:10:18.088
But I want to be with you.

1:10:19.630 --> 1:10:22.922
That's not possible, Alberto.
That's not possible.

1:10:23.172 --> 1:10:24.963
Please. You have to go.

1:10:26.630 --> 1:10:27.297
No.

1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:30.380
- Yes, Alberto.
- No!

1:10:30.547 --> 1:10:32.130
- Yes.
- No!

1:10:32.380 --> 1:10:34.213
No! No!

1:10:34.588 --> 1:10:35.338
No!

1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:36.672
No!

1:10:36.963 --> 1:10:38.838
No!

1:10:44.213 --> 1:10:46.338
Then you leave me no choice!

1:10:47.797 --> 1:10:48.588
What are you doing?

1:10:50.172 --> 1:10:51.672
- Help me!
- What are you doing?

1:10:51.838 --> 1:10:54.130
- Help me!
- Pepe, don't!

1:10:56.422 --> 1:10:58.588
Are you two crazy?
Stop it!

1:10:58.755 --> 1:11:00.297
What do you care?

1:11:00.588 --> 1:11:02.255
Press down!
Help me!

1:11:04.505 --> 1:11:05.588
Hold him!

1:11:24.963 --> 1:11:26.672
You fucking bitch!

1:11:27.505 --> 1:11:29.755
You're not getting your money back!

1:11:32.338 --> 1:11:33.630
<i>Maestro!</i>

1:11:38.130 --> 1:11:40.963
Thank you, my love.

1:11:42.505 --> 1:11:44.630
I'll see you later at home.

1:11:45.713 --> 1:11:49.172
I'm going to work.

1:12:22.297 --> 1:12:24.380
Pepe, where the hell are you?

1:12:24.547 --> 1:12:26.213
We have to find Carlos.

1:12:45.297 --> 1:12:48.047
He hasn't come in.
And he'd better not.

1:13:39.547 --> 1:13:42.922
Josemi, hurry it up.
I've seen snails move faster!

1:13:43.088 --> 1:13:44.630
- Are you the extra help?
- Yes.

1:13:44.797 --> 1:13:48.672
Two prawns, two croquettes
and two cherry tomatoes per person!

1:13:48.838 --> 1:13:50.672
Long time no see, Benito.
How's Concha?

1:13:51.297 --> 1:13:53.005
We separated 15 years ago.

1:13:54.547 --> 1:13:55.213
I'm sorry.

1:13:56.797 --> 1:13:58.672
I want this full of trays!

1:14:16.297 --> 1:14:17.088
May I?

1:14:19.422 --> 1:14:21.463
That's fine. Thanks.

1:14:41.797 --> 1:14:43.838
Excuse me.
Who brought the monkey?

1:15:06.213 --> 1:15:08.963
Excuse me.
Do these contain gluten?

1:15:56.922 --> 1:15:59.213
Help. Help me...

1:16:06.297 --> 1:16:08.005
Hang in there!

1:16:32.422 --> 1:16:35.922
Don't just stand there.
Get moving.

1:16:36.130 --> 1:16:38.963
Come on, guys. Keep it moving!

1:17:18.713 --> 1:17:19.963
There he is.

1:17:27.338 --> 1:17:28.713
We have to go in there.

1:17:30.297 --> 1:17:33.172
Yes. But not looking like this.

1:17:43.047 --> 1:17:47.213
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

1:17:47.672 --> 1:17:52.172
Kiss, kiss, kiss...

1:18:04.088 --> 1:18:05.255
I can't see him.

1:18:11.380 --> 1:18:13.088
Save some for tomorrow!

1:18:51.880 --> 1:18:53.005
There he is!

1:19:08.380 --> 1:19:10.422
Pepe, we have to do something.

1:19:11.755 --> 1:19:13.255
Do you have eyeliner?

1:19:49.922 --> 1:19:52.088
My love, what are you doing here?

1:19:53.422 --> 1:19:54.880
Did you see the monkey?

1:19:56.838 --> 1:19:59.255
It's gone.
It's not coming back.

1:20:00.547 --> 1:20:02.047
It's alright, love.

1:20:05.297 --> 1:20:07.547
It's gone, don't worry.

1:20:17.422 --> 1:20:20.172
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:20:21.213 --> 1:20:25.172
at the request of the groom,
it is my pleasure to introduce

1:20:25.338 --> 1:20:28.797
a hypnosis show
like no other in the world

1:20:29.463 --> 1:20:33.422
that will open the door
to the fourth dimension.

1:20:34.713 --> 1:20:39.047
I give you, the one and only

1:20:39.797 --> 1:20:41.922
Peter Strauss!

1:21:00.505 --> 1:21:02.922
Good evening and welcome.

1:21:04.088 --> 1:21:07.630
Tonight I want to take you
on a journey into the beyond.

1:21:08.755 --> 1:21:11.797
But I need two volunteers.

1:21:14.713 --> 1:21:16.297
Two volunteers.

1:21:18.130 --> 1:21:18.922
No!

1:21:22.630 --> 1:21:24.005
A round of applause.

1:21:50.130 --> 1:21:54.755
I want you to keep
a close eye on my hands.

1:21:55.297 --> 1:21:57.630
Don't take your eyes off my finger.

1:21:59.005 --> 1:22:00.463
Gradually,

1:22:00.630 --> 1:22:03.713
you'll feel your eyelids

1:22:03.963 --> 1:22:05.088
getting heavy.

1:22:05.713 --> 1:22:08.047
Your eyes feel heavy.

1:22:08.713 --> 1:22:12.547
You're getting sleepy, very sleepy.

1:22:13.505 --> 1:22:17.297
One... two... three...

1:22:18.213 --> 1:22:19.130
Sleep.

1:22:24.380 --> 1:22:28.047
You start going down
an endless escalator

1:22:28.213 --> 1:22:32.130
which will take you
to the depths of your own minds.

1:22:32.922 --> 1:22:37.297
Ten... nine... eight... seven...

1:22:37.713 --> 1:22:39.588
deeper...

1:22:39.755 --> 1:22:43.463
six... five... four...

1:22:43.963 --> 1:22:47.088
deeper and deeper...

1:22:47.505 --> 1:22:48.630
three...

1:22:48.922 --> 1:22:49.838
two...

1:22:50.130 --> 1:22:51.088
one...

1:22:51.588 --> 1:22:52.547
zero.

1:22:53.588 --> 1:22:55.588
The lights come on

1:22:55.755 --> 1:22:59.005
and you find yourselves
in a white world,

1:22:59.172 --> 1:23:01.005
where everything,

1:23:01.255 --> 1:23:05.213
absolutely everything, is white.

1:23:07.297 --> 1:23:08.088
What?

1:23:19.755 --> 1:23:21.088
Carmen, don't be afraid.

1:23:23.213 --> 1:23:24.047
It's me.

1:23:27.838 --> 1:23:29.963
There's so much I want to tell you.

1:23:35.463 --> 1:23:36.922
Where are we?

1:24:09.713 --> 1:24:12.755
I'm going to beat the shit out of you!

1:24:12.922 --> 1:24:14.755
- Calm down, Carlos!
- Calm down?

1:24:15.380 --> 1:24:19.922
I'm trapped in this hell watching
my wife sleep with another man.

1:24:23.630 --> 1:24:24.463
Who are you?

1:24:25.797 --> 1:24:28.505
I'm Tito.
I'm you when you're not you.

1:24:30.213 --> 1:24:31.547
You're me?

1:24:31.922 --> 1:24:33.255
Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1:24:33.713 --> 1:24:35.797
I'll fucking kill you!

1:24:35.963 --> 1:24:39.005
Carlos, stop it!
Please, stop it!

1:24:42.797 --> 1:24:45.255
Carmen, untie me!

1:24:45.713 --> 1:24:47.213
Untie me!

1:24:47.380 --> 1:24:51.047
Quit torturing me!
Shit! Untie me! Carmen!

1:24:51.213 --> 1:24:52.213
Let me fucking go!

1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:54.547
Not until you calm down.
Do you hear me?

1:24:55.088 --> 1:24:56.880
Not until you calm down.

1:25:20.547 --> 1:25:23.047
Love, I'm embarrassed to say this, but...

1:25:24.463 --> 1:25:26.213
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

1:25:28.547 --> 1:25:30.047
You're right.

1:25:32.047 --> 1:25:34.005
I have a demon inside me.

1:25:37.713 --> 1:25:39.588
I loved you so much, but...

1:25:40.922 --> 1:25:42.172
I don't know how to do it.

1:25:45.338 --> 1:25:49.338
If you could give me another chance,
I swear I'll change, my love.

1:25:49.505 --> 1:25:50.797
Forgive me.

1:26:54.255 --> 1:26:56.672
I promise,
everything is going to change.

1:27:01.463 --> 1:27:02.463
Everything.

1:27:04.297 --> 1:27:06.088
Everything is going to change.

1:27:29.797 --> 1:27:31.713
I love you with all my life.

1:29:03.213 --> 1:29:05.547
Carmen, where are you going?

1:29:09.422 --> 1:29:10.505
Carmen!

1:29:14.213 --> 1:29:15.588
Carmen!

1:29:21.047 --> 1:29:24.005
Three... two... one...

1:29:24.672 --> 1:29:25.880
Awaken.

1:29:53.797 --> 1:29:54.672
Carmen!

1:29:55.922 --> 1:29:57.005
Carmen!

1:29:58.588 --> 1:29:59.713
Carmen!

1:30:00.505 --> 1:30:02.380
Carmen, where are you going?
