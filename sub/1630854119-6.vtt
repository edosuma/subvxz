24:42.981 --> 24:44.649
kills her husband
in a jealous rage

24:44.716 --> 24:45.884
to keep her all for himself?

24:45.951 --> 24:47.919
- Except they're already
getting a divorce.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.621
- And it doesn't explain
killing Mitchell.

24:49.688 --> 24:50.789
Think about it:
Becca lied to us

24:50.856 --> 24:52.490
about her marriage
and the school.

24:52.557 --> 24:53.892
Then her soon-to-be ex

24:53.959 --> 24:56.228
and the man looking
to finance a rival patent

24:56.294 --> 24:58.697
wind up murdered
by her star student.

24:58.763 --> 24:59.965
Could be they were
in this together.

25:00.031 --> 25:01.199
- But Jake's doing
all the dirty work.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.001
How's she making him do that?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.369
- This might have something
to do with it.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.276
- What's Mr. Ibogaine?
- I have no idea.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.978
Whatever it is,
maybe Becca is using it

25:13.044 --> 25:16.181
to dose him,
to control him.

25:16.248 --> 25:19.050
Looks like it was created
by Becca and a J. Bleckley.

25:19.117 --> 25:20.418
- Why don't you two see
if you can find out

25:20.485 --> 25:21.887
who this Bleckley is?

25:25.190 --> 25:28.059
- Becca and I used
to work together as chemists

25:28.126 --> 25:29.995
for a very long time.

25:30.061 --> 25:31.897
- Do you know about
her current job, Dr. Bleckley?

25:31.963 --> 25:33.398
- [chuckles] Yes.

25:33.465 --> 25:37.168
I was the one that
introduced her to psychedelics,

25:37.235 --> 25:40.272
though she's long
overtaken my expertise.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.240
- We think she may have
convinced her student

25:42.307 --> 25:44.409
to kill her husband
and another man

25:44.476 --> 25:46.344
over a dispute
about a patent.

25:46.411 --> 25:49.147
- I used to tell Becca
that she reminded me

25:49.214 --> 25:52.450
of liquid bromine in the lab--
volatile.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.720
She was convinced
her husband's friend,

25:55.787 --> 25:57.555
Magnus Karlsson,

25:57.622 --> 26:01.359
copied her formula
for synthetic psilocybin.

26:01.426 --> 26:04.029
He calls it RH-24.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.431
- And as a chemist,
what do you think?

26:06.498 --> 26:09.935
- That you shouldn't be able
to patent a mushroom.

26:10.001 --> 26:11.603
But Becca was probably right.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.606
I mean,
Magnus' crystalized salt forms

26:14.673 --> 26:16.808
were identical to hers.

26:16.875 --> 26:18.843
He was patent trolling.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.047
- And what else can you tell us
about Mr. Ibogaine?

26:22.113 --> 26:23.515
What makes it different
to RH-24?

26:23.581 --> 26:26.985
- It's a synthesis
that Becca and I developed.

26:27.052 --> 26:28.586
She thought
it was a breakthrough.

26:28.653 --> 26:29.821
I disagreed.

26:29.888 --> 26:31.089
- Why is that?

26:31.156 --> 26:33.959
- Ibogaine is much stronger
than psilocybin.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.261
People use it
to confront mental blocks.

26:36.328 --> 26:42.100
It creates a deep,
often emotionally painful trip.

26:42.167 --> 26:44.169
Becca liked it
'cause it made her clients

26:44.235 --> 26:46.171
like putty in her hands.

26:46.237 --> 26:48.440
- Well, that sounds dangerous.

26:48.506 --> 26:49.874
- It is.

26:49.941 --> 26:53.545
It can create a heart attack
if you're not careful.

26:53.611 --> 26:57.482
A powerful medicine
that is not to be trifled with.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.217
- And
what about Becca's student?

26:59.284 --> 27:02.120
Could she use Mr. Ibogaine
to talk him into murder?

27:02.187 --> 27:03.521
- Given the right regimen,

27:03.588 --> 27:06.157
she could talk him
into almost anything.

27:06.224 --> 27:11.096
Psychedelics make the user
highly suggestible.

27:12.998 --> 27:15.433
- So what's the motive
for murder here?

27:15.500 --> 27:19.004
We know the school and that
pill were Becca's life's work

27:19.070 --> 27:20.638
but also community property.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.208
When they were sold,
Becca was furious,

27:23.274 --> 27:24.809
especially when she found out
the buyer

27:24.876 --> 27:27.579
was her husband's college
buddy, Magnus Karlsson,

27:27.645 --> 27:29.014
at Rega Health.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.782
- If Becca blames Mitchell
and her husband,

27:30.849 --> 27:32.083
she probably blames Magnus too.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.284
- Exactly.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.353
Ray is on the way
to his office right now.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.355
- So we know
this is a trigger for Becca,

27:37.422 --> 27:38.823
but she's not the one
knifing people to death.

27:38.890 --> 27:41.359
So what about Jake?
- Well, he's under her control.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.660
She's been
feeding him ibogaine,

27:42.727 --> 27:44.596
which makes people
highly suggestible.

27:44.662 --> 27:46.531
- So he's
some sort of Frankenstein?

27:46.598 --> 27:49.034
- Mm, that mixed
with the Manson family.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.404
What's all that?

27:52.470 --> 27:55.206
- Jake made hundreds of entries
into these journals, OK?

27:55.273 --> 27:57.709
So his trips are like
religious experiences,

27:57.776 --> 27:59.210
and Becca controls when, where,

27:59.277 --> 28:01.846
and how he communes
with the mystics.

28:01.913 --> 28:03.081
