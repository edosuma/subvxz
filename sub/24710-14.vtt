I've got her photo you gave me.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.701

I got half a chance

she would talk about.

11:25.309 --> 11:26.310
As far as your knowing,

he's only connected to the forgeries
on your checking account?

-Rafael Vasquez.
-Did you know the little girl?

13:09.580 --> 13:12.833
-Jennifer? Not too much.
-No idea what happened to her?

13:12.958 --> 13:15.211
How I'm gonna know
what happened to her? Some maniac.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.171
You know Luis Hernandez?

13:18.005 --> 13:21.300
Was it him? He could've done it,
crazy as he gets on his liquor.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.677
-Are those your tools?
-RAFAEL: No.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.347
-Who was working on that radiator?
-(SCOFFS)

13:26.722 --> 13:29.517
I was working on the radiator,
but those tools aren't mine.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.602
Those tools was lying out there
on the floor today,

13:31.685 --> 13:34.271
and I got trouble getting heat
into my apartment,

13:34.355 --> 13:36.106
so I was working on the radiator
with a wrench.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.233
When did you first see 'em?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.652
-Luis?
-No, the tools. The tools.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.987
Eh, like ten o'clock.
Those look like the super's tools.

-You're gonna have to come in with us.
-RAFAEL: Over what?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.660
The super reported his tools got stolen,

13:47.743 --> 13:49.745
-and they're in your custody.
-Those tools was by the radiator.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.289
-Somebody must've put 'em there.
-You gonna start breakin' balls now?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.750
How we might be able
to rectify this, Rafael,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.335
you want to let us look in your apartment?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.546
Hell, no. I don't want
you to look in my apartment.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.006
Nobody's gonna jam you
for a little reefer or the like.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.800
That's what you say now.
how I'm gonna trust you?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.427
-All right, come on, you're going in.
-Hey, I was mopping the floor out here.

to the station house.

-ANDY: Let's go.

It's time to stop crackin' wise, Anthony,

15:01.025 --> 15:02.943
'cause this Mr. Rosenzweig
puts you involved

15:03.027 --> 15:06.030
in an embezzlement scam,
involving his checking account.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.991
Who you wanna talk
to is Alexis Wilkenson.

-Who would that be?
-Don't piss in my ear

15:10.868 --> 15:13.287

you know who Alexis is.

We'll think for us, Anthony.
You think for you.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.834
-What's your connection with Alexis?
-My connection,

15:19.293 --> 15:20.961
as part of my overall lucky life,

15:21.337 --> 15:24.673
was Alexis decided to back
my pizza review web site

15:24.757 --> 15:26.550
'cause I was Mr. Right.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.348
-Your pizza review web site?
-That's the same dead-fish look

15:32.431 --> 15:34.516
when I told my aunt
I had a web site for books.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.728
Who would subscribe
to a web site for books?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.355
Amazon.com, all right, pal?

15:40.731 --> 15:43.442
Did you maybe suggest Alexis
could get the financial support

15:43.525 --> 15:45.486
you were lookin' for from Mr. Rosenzweig?

15:45.653 --> 15:51.325
No. I was presented with financial support
as the first part of "Surprise Thursday."

15:51.867 --> 15:53.661
What was, uh, Surprise Thursday?

15:54.036 --> 15:57.373
That's the day you get
4,600 dollars I never asked for,

15:57.873 --> 16:00.501
and I find out Alexis is a man!

-(ANTHONY EXHALING)
-...was over 8,000.

16:15.891 --> 16:16.934
Oh, yeah.

16:17.101 --> 16:21.355
Well, she told me the other 3,500
was to go to Philadelphia for an operation

16:21.480 --> 16:24.233
so she could come back to me
with a real love channel.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.611
You got an address
for her in Philadelphia?

This is Alexis before her hormone shots.
If I'd have seen this picture before,

16:51.385 --> 16:54.138
the entire course of my life
would be different.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.684
Those tools was on the back stairs.
All I did was pick 'em up.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.477
-When was that?
-Today, this morning.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.689
-They was on the back stairs.
-You own a rifle, Rafael?

A rifle? No. Look, I make no claim
those tools are mine.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.652

and tell him to go to hell.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.696

you saw Jennifer Dieguez?

-Startin' when?
-9:00, maybe. My mother, my brother.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.415
Your mother and brother
usually come that early?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.168
My mother had some soup for me.
She knew I hadn't been eating.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.086
Why was that?

17:27.004 --> 17:31.800
Losing my job, my wife and kid leaving.
Vicki couldn't take me being out of work.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.386
See, but I eat soup
even if I'm feeling bad.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.723
Rafael, are we gonna find
your fingerprints

17:37.806 --> 17:38.807
-down in that basement?
-No.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.267
-You ever been down there?
-RAFAEL: No.

17:40.350 --> 17:43.479
You sayin' no, if we go ahead
and we find your prints down there,

17:43.562 --> 17:45.647
that makes you guilty
of first-degree murder.

17:52.571 --> 17:53.822

I might have been down there,
once, two weeks ago.

-Franklin left the door open.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.251
Wasn't that hot this mornin'.

Yeah, but it was hot as hell
when I was down there.

Is that when you stole his tools?

18:09.797 --> 18:12.424

I realized she took it.

to take care of my husband.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.296
Did you ever know Rafael
to lose his temper?

25:48.588 --> 25:51.091
He should have lost his temper
with Vicki, and he didn't.

25:51.216 --> 25:54.678
-His wife that left with their daughter?
-As soon as times go hard,

25:54.761 --> 25:57.556
Rafael loses his job,
she leaves with the<i> niña.</i>

25:57.889 --> 25:59.015
And you got to bring him soup.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.769
She'll see.
One day Rafael will have a good job

26:03.061 --> 26:06.022
with good pay,
and then she'll want him back.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.692
Okay. Thanks very much, Mrs. Vasquez.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.612
Where is Rafael?

26:12.696 --> 26:15.323
Rafael's in custody right now
for stealing the super's tools.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.701
He didn't.
He don't have no need for those.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.744
DANNY: Anyways,
thanks very much, Mrs. Vasquez.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.413
(EXHALES)

26:22.581 --> 26:25.625
-When is he getting released?
-We'll have to let you know on that.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.591
(INHALES)
What did you find at that building?

26:32.799 --> 26:37.053
(EXHALES) That Rafael that's in custody
for, uh, stealin' the super's tools,

26:37.887 --> 26:39.556
there's a tunnel
from his first-floor apartment

26:39.681 --> 26:41.808
-down to his cellar.
-ARTHUR: How did E.S.U. miss the egress

26:41.933 --> 26:43.935
-in the basement ceiling?
-The hole's in the ceiling

26:44.019 --> 26:46.021
on the other side of an inner wall.
Once he had her down there,

26:46.104 --> 26:48.231
there's a 12-inch separation
between the two walls.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.899
He could have dragged
the little girl through that

26:49.983 --> 26:52.277
-to where we found her body.
-How you gonna go at him?

26:53.320 --> 26:54.821
We're gonna
put our heads together on that.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.580
Uh. Your sister called.
She said Angela's at 7:00 is fine.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.541
-That was her now?
-No. That was bigmouth Mr. Franklin

27:06.625 --> 27:09.044
wanting to know
about his tools. I handled it.

27:09.377 --> 27:12.255
Did we hear from the M.E.
if the autopsy rape kit came back?

27:12.464 --> 27:14.174
They said
they should have it in half an hour.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.179
That'd close it.

27:20.055 --> 27:23.099
Yeah. Whatever the kit shows, Andy,
the tunnel's still the card you turn.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.353
Positive rape kit,
at... at least we can play to a motive.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.522
Otherwise, we have to get
how he's under instructions

27:29.606 --> 27:30.732
from other planets.

27:31.024 --> 27:32.609
Hey, we could walk
into that room now, Andy,

27:32.692 --> 27:34.778
and find Rafael in that cell
standin' on his head

27:34.861 --> 27:36.321
tryin' to spit up his own nose.

27:38.865 --> 27:40.492
(CLEARS THROAT)
Even you being so close-mouthed,

27:40.575 --> 27:42.619
I gather she doesn't come
into town that often.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.162
Don't worry about that. (EXHALES)

27:44.287 --> 27:45.997
I can warm him up.
You can come back afterward.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.459
No. I'm good.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.632
-We'll wait ten minutes for the M.E.
-Good. Fine.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.314
She took that all right, losin' her watch.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.191
(EXHALES) Better than me.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.779
(SIGHS) She's gettin' her
teacher's certificate

28:17.862 --> 28:21.408
in primary education, Laurie.
She enjoys workin' with the little ones.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.957
-Your people out on Staten Island?
-(CLEARS THROAT) My aunt and uncle.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.464
Our younger sister's a second-semester
junior at Albany state.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.758
She's gonna be a dental technician, Kathy.

28:40.552 --> 28:41.928
You grow up with your aunt and uncle?

28:42.721 --> 28:46.725
Since I'm six, Uncle Lou and Aunt Karen.
The girls were three and one.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.103
Then I went in service. (INHALES)

28:50.854 --> 28:53.773
(CLEARS THROAT) Our parents are dead.

28:57.777 --> 28:58.862
Anyways...

29:00.363 --> 29:05.744
-Um. Let's not wait on the rape kit.
-Yeah. Hit him with the tunnel, Rafael.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.517
You talk to my mother and brother?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.567
We talked to your mother.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.862
-Arturo got day work?
-Your brother didn't come in.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.156
But my mother verified
about bringing me the soup, right?

29:43.573 --> 29:46.034
Let's postpone the soup
discussions, Rafael.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.787
Let's talk about that hole
in your closet floor

29:48.912 --> 29:52.248
-goes down to the basement.
-That was there when I got there.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.334
Did you reopen that tunnel
to the basement?

29:54.459 --> 29:57.504
-Why would I reopen it?
-That don't fly, Rafael.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.922
This is a child homicide.

29:59.380 --> 30:02.133
Answer questions with questions,
you start taking a beating.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.260
I don't deal with no basements, all right?

30:05.386 --> 30:09.182
If there was a tunnel from my closet,
that's a previous tenant.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.559
No circumstances you go
down to the basement?

30:11.643 --> 30:14.020
-Correct, all right?
-All the above-ground floors are burning,

30:14.103 --> 30:16.022
-you don't go down there?
-You go down into hell?

30:17.357 --> 30:21.528
-No. I try to avoid that.
-But I'm supposed to go down? 'Cause why?

30:21.861 --> 30:24.155
You were saying a few weeks ago,
it was hot as hell.

30:24.614 --> 30:26.658
A few weeks ago,
it was colder than a witch's tit.

30:26.741 --> 30:27.742
Never got above 20.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.954
You said you were in the basement
a few weeks ago,

30:31.037 --> 30:33.581
and, when you were down there,
it was hot as hell.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.917
Hey, I'm through.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.753
If she explained about the soup,
I'm outta here.

30:38.962 --> 30:42.090
Rafael, we found a tunnel
from your apartment into the basement

30:42.173 --> 30:44.634
which otherwise the super keeps locked
with a steel door.

30:44.884 --> 30:47.053
We found a nine-year-old girl
from your building

30:47.136 --> 30:49.472
-dead in that basement.
-Franklin probably did it, then.

30:49.889 --> 30:53.226
He's a prick. He don't mind what he does.
He can go to hell with his tools.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.395
You give him back those tools,
tell him to go to hell.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.232
What don't Franklin mind, Rafael,
killing a nine-year-old?

30:59.399 --> 31:01.276
-You said it. I didn't.
-Or working in hell?

31:01.442 --> 31:03.987
He's the super. Ask him.
I don't deal with that mess.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.614
-That's not what my mother raised me for.
-To work in no basement?

31:06.906 --> 31:09.909
Even if I'm unemployed
and I can't get no other job, all right?

31:10.326 --> 31:13.621
-Even if your wife leaves with your child?
-Don't ask me. Ask Vicki.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.958
That's not what I'm raised for.
That's not what I can do.

31:17.041 --> 31:20.128
You ever crawl down to that basement,
remind yourself of where

31:20.211 --> 31:23.131
-you can't ever work?
-Remind myself what I can't do?

31:24.382 --> 31:26.843
That's a previous tenant.
Maybe he wanted to be a super.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.388
-What happened to Jennifer, Rafael?
-Ask a previous tenant.

31:30.638 --> 31:32.891
What do you think the previous tenant did?

31:34.684 --> 31:37.353
Possibly she taunted him. Don't ask me.

31:39.522 --> 31:44.193
She sent him a mind message
that she was with her family still...

31:44.360 --> 31:47.655
(EXHALES)
...and his wasn't, or his family had left.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.951
-Maybe he lost his temper and hurt her.
-He didn't rape her, though.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.079
And then took her down through the tunnel.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.373
Maybe he wanted a job he couldn't take

31:58.333 --> 32:00.543
because of circumstances
over his control...

32:02.337 --> 32:04.339
And he had to eat her soup instead...

32:08.343 --> 32:10.595
(SOBS)
...and that's why he lost his family.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.559
(SOBS) Maybe he deserved to be in hell.

-GREG: How's it goin', Mr. Rosenzweig?
-What's new?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.794
-Let's talk back here.
-Just don't tell me she's dead.

32:43.169 --> 32:45.505
No, uh, Alexis is not dead.

32:56.349 --> 33:00.645
The truth is, Mr. Rosenzweig,
as far as your checking account goes, uh,

33:01.312 --> 33:03.731
we don't feel that Anthony Rosselli
was involved.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.109
We, uh, spoke with Tony Rosselli,

33:06.192 --> 33:08.820
and we had occasion
also to speak with Alexis.

33:09.362 --> 33:12.532
You're definite she was on her own?

33:14.826 --> 33:18.079
If she loved me, how do you account
for her taking the money?

33:18.204 --> 33:20.456
Is there any reason
she could have taken that money

33:21.165 --> 33:25.628
that would piss you off so bad,
a... any fact you could learn about her

33:26.087 --> 33:31.092
that would make you say...
"To heck with this Alexis?"

33:31.384 --> 33:34.637
"Tell the Philadelphia P.D.
to lock this Alexis up."

33:35.638 --> 33:39.308
"To heck with my positive feelings
and the great times we had

33:39.392 --> 33:42.353
"with me doing the hell of a job I did
in the sex department."

an escaped Nazi war criminal.

33:47.483 --> 33:50.611
-She's not.
-I don't want to know.

I don't let myself be a financial dupe,

she still may have with me.

34:09.589 --> 34:12.759
Uh. The moral for me is more like,
Viagra's got a lot to answer for.

34:23.186 --> 34:26.355
I don't know what kind of sense
this Rafael's statement's gonna make.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.149
He admits he did it?

34:28.566 --> 34:30.151
They'll find blood evidence
in that tunnel.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.820
Yeah. They won't find it
in Rafael's closet.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.281
He washed it up after he dragged her down.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.617

No. I can't do that tonight, Laur.

40:28.134 --> 40:30.636
-They're all okay, though?
-Yeah, they're okay.

40:31.137 --> 40:34.432
And school's okay? June, right?
You're getting your teacher's certificate?

40:35.474 --> 40:37.226
It's a little awkward
you're not in touch, Danny.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.228
Who, with Aunt Karen and Uncle Lou?

40:41.147 --> 40:42.481
It hurts their feelings a little.

40:44.108 --> 40:47.194
I'll get in touch with Aunt Karen
and Uncle Lou more. I definitely will.

40:49.905 --> 40:51.407
Don't be so lonesome, Danny.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.952
I'm not lonesome, Laur. I'm busy.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.080
Okay, sis?

41:05.421 --> 41:07.673
(CLEARS THROAT) Did Shannon
take south street down to the ferry?

41:08.090 --> 41:09.091
I didn't notice.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.802
Yeah, 'cause that's definitely
the best route if this guy speaks English.

41:12.219 --> 41:14.388
And that Shannon's a nice guy
if he happens to call.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.963
Once I was in service,
and with being a cop,

41:48.047 --> 41:49.298
I could put decent money away.

41:49.632 --> 41:53.052
Provide solid educations
as far as their future job employment.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.221
They're lucky
they've got you for a brother.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.474
Well, I'm lucky I got them for sisters.
Are you kiddin' me?

41:58.807 --> 42:01.435
I'd as likely been locked up
as decently employed.

42:01.936 --> 42:04.021
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah?

42:04.939 --> 42:07.608
(CHUCKLES)
You would've been a bank robber?

42:07.858 --> 42:09.026
(CHUCKLES) No,

42:09.276 --> 42:12.655
but I become a true long-ball threat
behind a couple of beers, Nadine.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.865
I get some peculiar Ideas of fun.

42:15.658 --> 42:18.619
(INHALES) Maybe all what went
on was... (EXHALES)

42:18.786 --> 42:22.206
...God's only recourse,
preventing me screwing up. (EXHALES)

42:23.374 --> 42:24.458
Well, anyway...

42:29.964 --> 42:32.174
(EXHALES) I like your ideas of fun.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.010
I just wish you'd get them
a little earlier in the night.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.805
(INHALES, EXHALES)

42:40.808 --> 42:42.726
This wasn't me showing up after the bars.

42:43.435 --> 42:45.479
I was walking
since I dropped my sister off.

42:46.021 --> 42:48.357
(INHALES) I figure, appear at 1:30...

42:48.440 --> 42:49.775
-(CHUCKLES)
-...when you're half-asleep,

42:50.359 --> 42:52.152
that's my best chance of gettin' lucky.

42:52.736 --> 42:56.740
-(CHUCKLES) What's that?
-Me pushin' my luck.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.867
(CHUCKLES)

43:05.457 --> 43:07.960
(INHALES) What'd you mean before?

43:08.877 --> 43:09.962
Before when?

43:10.796 --> 43:13.382
When you said, "All that went on."

43:15.050 --> 43:16.135
All that went on?

43:17.261 --> 43:18.679
(EXHALES)

43:19.680 --> 43:22.516
(SIGHS) I'll tell you when
I'm ready to tell you, all right, Nadine?

43:22.600 --> 43:24.935
(EXHALES)

43:28.689 --> 43:30.024
(EXHALES)

43:38.532 --> 43:39.533
Good night.

43:55.382 --> 43:57.426
