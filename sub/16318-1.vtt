33:52.567 --> 33:55.916

33:55.951 --> 33:58.895
if you want, you can do anything to me

33:58.930 --> 34:00.850
say something!

35:29.197 --> 35:33.116
I don't know why these pictures will connect online

35:35.086 --> 35:39.008
sorry for interrupting you prime minister

35:39.042 --> 35:42.931
as what you see our army now occupy this town

35:44.901 --> 35:50.787
bother you, prime minister call me with the number on the screen in 5 minutes

35:52.753 --> 35:56.673
if you delay for one second we will kill the villagers in front of the media

36:04.532 --> 36:06.486
give me the phone

36:12.384 --> 36:16.303
who are you? What do you want?

36:19.255 --> 36:22.199
It's the voice of prime minister

36:22.234 --> 36:24.128
how are you prime minister

36:24.163 --> 36:27.073
Who are you?
What do you want?

36:27.107 --> 36:32.009
I will say it straightly it's really not a big request

36:32.997 --> 36:36.916
I just want Yang's life to exchange the lives of these hundreds of villagers

36:39.867 --> 36:43.786
send Mr. Yang to us before tomorrow afternoon

36:44.774 --> 36:48.694
if you delay for one second I will show all of you the slaughter on live

36:50.664 --> 36:55.566
remember, I don't like to kill I love peace, so don't do anything ridiculous

37:01.461 --> 37:05.380
everybody, we must save our villagers

37:15.202 --> 37:17.156
Dad

37:18.146 --> 37:20.101
calm down

37:22.073 --> 37:25.992
we must find a way to leave this town

37:28.944 --> 37:32.863
you go to find it, I'd stay here

37:42.685 --> 37:44.639
follow me

37:58.390 --> 38:00.344
zoom in to look

38:03.297 --> 38:05.252
closer

38:09.187 --> 38:13.106
damn it, attempt me, right?

38:27.836 --> 38:31.755
They are killing villagers, minister

38:45.503 --> 38:47.458
back off

38:58.263 --> 39:02.189
find a villager who has child and put camera to the child

39:02.223 --> 39:03.160
come out!

39:46.359 --> 39:48.312
Dad!

39:52.248 --> 39:56.167
You must revenge for me!

39:59.118 --> 40:01.073
Dad!

40:19.731 --> 40:21.693
Want see villagers dying?

40:21.728 --> 40:22.641
Calm down

40:22.675 --> 40:26.594
sure, if you dare to come again ask the troop to retreat out of 5 miles away

40:27.582 --> 40:31.502
if I saw any your army man all the villagers would be killed

40:32.491 --> 40:35.401
I request you send Mr. Yang back 8 A.M. Tomorrow

40:35.435 --> 40:40.336
our army would stay in the village until make
sure there's no one follow us we will retreat

40:41.324 --> 40:45.243
if you want to do anything stupid again I swear to kill them all

42:26.348 --> 42:30.274
we have installed the missile about the head and tail...

42:30.308 --> 42:32.203
make it simple

42:32.237 --> 42:36.156
yes, please come along

42:40.090 --> 42:44.991
the missile would attack the target automatically
throngh software after dedicating the path

42:47.942 --> 42:49.905
precision?

42:49.940 --> 42:52.816
90%

42:52.850 --> 42:56.776
we should look Bangkok as the center

42:56.810 --> 42:59.720
make Bangkok as the target

42:59.755 --> 43:01.675
OK

43:03.646 --> 43:07.538
8 o'clock tomorrow I could get Mr. Yang

43:07.573 --> 43:11.492
and about 20 minutes later we could leave the border of Thailand

43:12.480 --> 43:18.365
Fang, you launch the nuclear missile you got
5 minutes to take the army leave the village

43:25.240 --> 43:30.142
after we leave you must broadcast this to all the media

43:34.074 --> 43:37.993
tomorrow no one would be alive to leave here

43:39.963 --> 43:43.885
and Bangkok will disappear from Thailand's map

43:43.919 --> 43:47.809
all over the world will know no one could stop us

43:54.686 --> 43:58.612
throw the gun I ask you to throw the gun

45:47.563 --> 45:51.482
we got order, don't wait for Mr. Yang we
can lauch the nuclear missile to Bangkok

46:07.193 --> 46:09.147
don't

46:45.473 --> 46:46.420
don't

46:46.454 --> 46:50.373
what's wrong brother?

46:51.362 --> 46:53.291
Brother

46:53.325 --> 46:55.279
just a nightmare

46:59.214 --> 47:01.169
it will never happen

47:32.586 --> 47:36.505
you think what could we do?

47:38.476 --> 47:42.395
Wait to die or rebel?

47:50.254 --> 47:52.182
You don't belive me, do you?

47:52.217 --> 47:56.137
You have seen that they killed too many people of our own

48:00.069 --> 48:03.988
how many Thais do we have?

48:09.884 --> 48:12.821
I am serious

49:08.776 --> 49:10.731
think about it

49:13.684 --> 49:17.603
our father, mother, brother, sister there

49:24.482 --> 49:29.383
if we are together to rebel they have a chance to live

50:02.761 --> 50:06.680
national anthem and flag is the symbol of Thailand

50:07.669 --> 50:08.616
so we should respect our anthem and flag

50:08.650 --> 50:13.552
we are proud of our country and the people dying for the country

50:55.763 --> 50:59.683
8 o'clock (in Thailand, they would play anthem at 8 A.M. Every day)

51:31.099 --> 51:33.054
Shut up

51:41.895 --> 51:45.815
get up get up

52:38.825 --> 52:42.744
hurry come to help

52:58.455 --> 53:00.409
take the guns

53:08.271 --> 53:10.225

53:32.809 --> 53:34.763

53:45.569 --> 53:47.524
Counterattack

53:50.476 --> 53:52.431
