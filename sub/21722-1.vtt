01:05.399 --> 01:07.168
- Claire.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.658
- I just wish you
wouldn't leave.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.693
- I don't want to be
here anymore.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.895
I can't stand
the constant reminders

04:54.995 --> 04:56.497
of walking in you

04:56.597 --> 04:58.165
in our bed!

05:05.205 --> 05:07.240
- Come on, Claire, don't go!

05:07.908 --> 05:09.176
- I have to.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.144
I'm just done here.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.213
I want to go home.

05:14.348 --> 05:16.216
- Don't you think
it's a little abrupt?

05:16.316 --> 05:17.918
- No, I really don't.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.889
This is not the place
for me anymore,

05:21.989 --> 05:23.491
especially not now.

05:23.591 --> 05:25.325
- I think you're
being irrational,

05:25.859 --> 05:28.228
and trust me, I know it's hard.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.730
I've been there.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.831
When Steve and I broke up

05:30.931 --> 05:32.700
I lost, like, 20 pounds.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.269
You're first big break up is
always the hardest.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.506
You can't even think straight.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.775
I can't believe Eric.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.777
What an asshole!

05:43.877 --> 05:46.414
Do you think he was doing it for
a long time?

05:46.947 --> 05:49.082
- Yeah, I do.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.851
The girl works with him.

05:52.219 --> 05:55.188
The thought makes me
want to throw up.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.725
I can't get the image
out of my head.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.395
- I'm so sorry, Claire.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.531
I know this must be
hard for you.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.233
I just don't think leaving
is the answer.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.802
- Well, I'm sorry you
don't like my decision.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.405
- Come on!
Don't get all defensive.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.441
- It's for the best.

06:13.607 --> 06:17.911
- I just worry you're not really
dealing with this,

06:18.278 --> 06:19.813
that you're just holding
everything

06:19.913 --> 06:21.882
inside and running away.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.751
- Why does everyone
think I'm running?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.328
Because maybe you are.

06:25.352 --> 06:26.487
- What am I running from?

06:27.120 --> 06:31.725
- The situation!
A really bad situation.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.327
- I just feel lost.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.000
I'm going to miss you.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.974
- Maybe you should try and
consider this as a vacation.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.743
Consider coming back

06:50.343 --> 06:52.513
once you've had time to regroup

06:52.613 --> 06:55.248
and the wound's not so fresh.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.285
- I will.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.755
- So how long will it take to
get to Chicago?

07:01.855 --> 07:02.855
- About three days.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.124
I'm not going to push myself.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.305
- It's going to be OK.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.474
- I'm trying to believe that.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.143
- Nebraska smells like poo.

07:23.243 --> 07:24.612
- All of it?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.614
- I don't know, but a good
portion.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.381
Don't roll your windows down.

07:28.482 --> 07:29.149
- OK.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.884
Thanks, good tip.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.053
- Glad to help.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.697
OK. So, do you have your camera?

07:43.897 --> 07:44.965
- Check!

07:45.298 --> 07:46.399
- Phone?

07:46.500 --> 07:48.035
- Check!

07:48.201 --> 07:49.336
- GPS?

07:49.436 --> 07:50.571
- What do you think?

07:50.671 --> 07:51.972
- Fair enough.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.240
Maps?

07:53.340 --> 07:54.642
- Check.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.743
- All right.

07:56.510 --> 07:59.179
Well, call me if you need
anything,

07:59.279 --> 08:00.748
or if you get bored.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.214
I'll be at home

08:02.282 --> 08:04.985
watching Real Housewives Bravo
marathon.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.188
- Thanks, Shannon. Love you!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.724
- You, too.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.360
- OK. I'm off.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
- Hey, Mom.

09:03.410 --> 09:04.945
Yeah. I'm, like, three hours in.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.479
It's fine.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.750
No. No traffic.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.986
I'm not great.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.955
I can't think straight.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.256
I just feel like

09:16.356 --> 09:18.726
my whole world is crumbling down
all around me.

09:21.461 --> 09:23.230
I know it'll be OK.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.299
It's just hard to see that right
now.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.503
Love you, too.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.906
I can't wait to see you guys.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.474
OK, bye.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.804
- Got any toilet paper?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.505
- Hold on a minute!

12:56.944 --> 12:58.678
- Got any toilet paper?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.713
- God! Help yourself!

13:44.925 --> 13:46.426
- Oh, fuck.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.603
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!

13:57.504 --> 14:00.007
God fucking dammit!

14:00.107 --> 14:02.943
Ugh! I cannot believe this!

14:36.143 --> 14:38.311
- Did you see a cell phone in
here?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.411
- Huh?

14:40.413 --> 14:42.333
- Did you see a cell phone in
the bathroom stall?

14:42.415 --> 14:43.450
- What phone?

14:43.550 --> 14:45.618
- Do you have my phone?

14:45.718 --> 14:47.154
- I don't have no fucking phone!

14:47.254 --> 14:49.389
- Fine! Enjoy!

15:51.384 --> 15:53.553
- Would you just get off my ass?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.876
No, no, no!

16:18.545 --> 16:20.813
Why is this happening?

16:21.348 --> 16:24.217
Come on, come on, come on.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.387
Why is this happening to me?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.921
Come on!

16:29.189 --> 16:30.323
Please!

16:31.858 --> 16:33.326
Come on!

17:39.292 --> 17:42.329
Oh, God, I still have to pee.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.577
I have reached a new low.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.977
Hey! Stop! Please!

18:31.178 --> 18:32.945
Please stop!

18:35.315 --> 18:37.784
Thanks a lot!

19:00.707 --> 19:03.142
Please, please.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.231
- You having car trouble?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.899
- Yeah. I don't know what
happened.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.202
It made some crazy noises and
then it just stalled.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.847
- Well, I don't know anything
about cars

19:31.871 --> 19:32.871
but I can give you a ride

19:32.939 --> 19:34.674
to the mechanic here in town.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.108
- Oh.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.712
- You want a ride or not?

19:41.448 --> 19:44.884
- Yeah. I do. I'm just, you
know,

19:44.984 --> 19:48.221
I'm nervous about getting in a
car with a stranger.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.622
- Well, I guess you've

19:49.722 --> 19:51.424
got to take that chance, don't
you?

19:51.524 --> 19:54.126
Or wait for somebody else to
come around.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.863
- I know. I appreciate your
help.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.631
I mean no disrespect.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.967
- None taken.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.939
- Yeah, I need to get my car
fixed, so...

20:08.140 --> 20:10.310
- You want to see my driver's
license?

20:10.610 --> 20:13.613
- No, that's not necessary.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.249
- OK, then.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.283
The mechanic can probably

20:17.817 --> 20:19.419
bring his truck and tow your car
later.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.653
- Are you sure?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.365
- I don't think he'll be able to
fix it today,

20:22.389 --> 20:24.924
but we've got a motel in town
you can stay in.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.431
- I hate to leave my car with all my...
- What's that?

20:31.798 --> 20:33.400
- Nothing.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.601
- All right.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.911
Well, we don't want you standing

20:35.935 --> 20:37.937
out here in the dark all by
yourself, now do we?

20:38.037 --> 20:40.172
- Yeah. OK.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.856
- I'm Gus, by the way.

21:31.824 --> 21:34.661
- I'm Claire. Nice to meet you,
Gus.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.550
- Nuts?

21:58.551 --> 22:01.521
Salted cashews, good stuff.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.223
- No, thanks.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.159
- Suit yourself.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.867
- So where you coming in from?

22:15.502 --> 22:16.903
- L.A.

22:17.003 --> 22:22.509
- Oh. L.A. I figured you was
from somewhere.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.244
I know almost everybody around
here,

22:25.344 --> 22:27.514
you know, it's a factory town.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.115
- Ah.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.953
- You in the movie business?

22:35.788 --> 22:37.590
- I was trying to make it as an
actress.

22:37.690 --> 22:40.126
- Actress? Look at you!

22:41.894 --> 22:44.196
You been in anything I've seen?

22:44.531 --> 22:47.634
- No. I didn't get that far.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.268
I did a lot of theater.

22:50.603 --> 22:52.739
- I saw a play once.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.542
Fell asleep, though.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.914
- Yeah, they can be pretty
boring sometimes.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.218
- I hope this place is still
open.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.621
They usually close around seven,

23:09.656 --> 23:13.125
but if not I can call Eddie on
his cell

23:13.392 --> 23:16.128
and maybe drop you off at the
hotel,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.964
get it fixed in the morning.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.500
- What time is it?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.168
It's about 7:30.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.511
Well, here we are.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.421
Eddie?

23:47.627 --> 23:49.128
Eddie?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.435
- Hi, Gus.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.306
- Hi!

24:02.374 --> 24:06.445
Hi! My car broke down back by
the highway.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.947
Can you help me?

24:08.047 --> 24:09.682
- What's wrong with it?

24:10.216 --> 24:12.952
- I don't know. I don't know
anything about cars.

24:13.052 --> 24:13.953
- I'm going to take off.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.955
My wife will kill me if I'm
late.

24:16.055 --> 24:17.624
She's making beef and cheese
squares,

24:17.724 --> 24:19.025
my favorite.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.460
- Thanks!

24:24.030 --> 24:26.232
So, you're Eddie?

24:26.332 --> 24:28.668
- How'd you know that?

24:28.768 --> 24:29.878
- Gus said that was your name.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.204
- Oh, yeah. I'm Eddie.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.413
So where's your car?

24:41.914 --> 24:46.519
- It's on Baker Street, back by
the highway off-ramp.

24:50.422 --> 24:53.693
- I'm going to have to get the
tow truck to get it.

24:53.793 --> 24:54.661
It's going to be 100 dollars,

24:54.761 --> 24:56.729
that's before anything else I
do.

24:57.930 --> 25:00.366
- OK. I understand.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.571
- Do you want to wait here while
I get it?

25:05.171 --> 25:07.740
- OK. Alone?

25:08.174 --> 25:11.243
- You can wait inside of the
office.

25:11.544 --> 25:12.779
- OK.

25:26.392 --> 25:28.595
- It's down this way.

25:46.579 --> 25:49.315
I'm going to go get the tow
truck and get your car.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.218
I'll be back in half an hour.

25:52.318 --> 25:53.485
- OK.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.289
- Just have a seat.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.658
- OK.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.993
Seriously?

26:35.427 --> 26:36.863
Ugh!

27:25.211 --> 27:26.746
- I got your car.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.582
- OK. Great.

27:30.683 --> 27:32.685
- You need a new timing belt.

27:35.688 --> 27:37.589
- What does that mean?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.859
- I need to get a part,

27:39.959 --> 27:41.894
but I can't get it until
tomorrow.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.930
- Oh. Really?

27:45.097 --> 27:47.233
- Yeah, you'll have to stay
overnight.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.103
I'll get started on it first
thing tomorrow.

27:52.538 --> 27:56.776
- How much is this going
to cost?

27:58.544 --> 28:03.549
- Not sure. Probably around 600
dollars.

28:03.649 --> 28:06.052
- 600 dollars! Are you serious?

28:06.152 --> 28:09.255
- That's what it costs, parts
and labor.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.700
Eddie, I...

28:22.701 --> 28:28.340
have had the worst day
of my entire life.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.943
I don't have that much money.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.379
I'm in the midst of driving
across country.

28:35.147 --> 28:38.150
Is there anything that you can
do in terms of cost?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.820
It literally is going to take
everything that I have.

28:42.154 --> 28:43.589
- I don't normally do that.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.992
I have to make a living.

28:46.092 --> 28:49.295
If I do that for you, I have to
do it for everyone.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.164
- I'm not from around here.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.732
Who am I going to tell?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.937
Please, Eddie, please.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.308
My boyfriend just broke up with
me

29:02.408 --> 29:03.943
and I don't think I can take any
more

29:04.043 --> 29:06.178
horrible things happening to me.

29:07.446 --> 29:11.450
Please, Eddie. I am begging you.

29:15.788 --> 29:22.261
- OK. OK, I won't charge you for
labor.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.833
That will cut it to just under
300 dollars.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.200
That's the best I can do.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.536
I hope you know I'm doing you a
really big favor.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.140
- Thank you!

29:42.181 --> 29:45.217
- I won't charge you for the
tow, either, OK?

29:49.188 --> 29:51.690
- What now? Where do I go?

29:53.459 --> 29:56.295
- I can drop you off in town on
my way home.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.664
I'll get started first thing
tomorrow.

29:59.531 --> 30:02.168
- OK, that's great! I'm
starving.

30:02.634 --> 30:07.073
And thank you. Really, I mean
it.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.176
Thank you. You're saving my
life.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.086
- Thanks for the ride.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.611
I'll see you tomorrow.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.293
- Hello?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.427
- Huh?

31:35.527 --> 31:36.828
- What will you have?

31:38.064 --> 31:42.168
- I definitely need a large
glass of wine.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.736
- Red or white?

31:46.172 --> 31:48.574
- I don't suppose you have a
Syrah, do you?

31:51.677 --> 31:52.778
Red.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.813
- Great.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.753
- You know what?

32:02.821 --> 32:05.291
On second thought, I'll have
something else.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.762
- Like what?

32:11.763 --> 32:14.033
- How about something with vodka
in it.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.301
Surprise me.

32:39.825 --> 32:41.027
Thanks.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.138
Do you have food here?

32:53.305 --> 32:55.074
- We've got sandwiches and
fries.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.175
Will that do?

32:56.275 --> 32:58.577
- Yeah, that would be amazing,
I'm so famished.

33:01.247 --> 33:03.382
- What kind of sandwich?

33:05.217 --> 33:06.652
- What do you have?

33:06.752 --> 33:10.189
- There's ham, turkey, roast
beef.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.591
- Ham sounds good. Ham and
cheese?

33:23.869 --> 33:25.737
This drink is good.

33:28.907 --> 33:30.209
Is there someplace around here

33:30.309 --> 33:31.777
that I can stay for the night?

33:31.877 --> 33:34.280
People keep mentioning this one
motel.

33:34.713 --> 33:38.550
- Yeah. There's a motel down the
way.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.719
Roadside Inn.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.225
- Is it, you know, OK?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.962
- What do you mean?

33:51.063 --> 33:53.532
- I mean, is it clean?

33:54.066 --> 33:55.601
Never mind.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.437
- Why wouldn't it be clean?

34:00.306 --> 34:03.775
- You know, just checking. OCD.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.726
Do you know if there's a pay
phone around here?

34:24.330 --> 34:25.964
- Outside.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.800
- OK, great.

34:30.835 --> 34:31.835
I don't even know

34:32.438 --> 34:33.918
how much a pay phone costs these
days.

34:41.513 --> 34:42.848
Thanks!

34:42.981 --> 34:44.583
Can I get a water, too?

34:55.694 --> 34:57.163
Thank you.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.851
Can I get another one of these
things you made?

35:27.326 --> 35:28.827
- Sure.

35:34.166 --> 35:40.506
- You know, you really look like
someone I know.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.708
Like, a lot.

36:04.230 --> 36:05.230
- Jack?

36:05.297 --> 36:06.498
- Yeah.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.337
- What are you drinking?

36:11.837 --> 36:14.540
- I don't know.
Something he made.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.174
It's pretty good, though.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.676
- You mean James?

36:19.245 --> 36:21.347
- Yeah, I guess.
Is that his name?

36:22.047 --> 36:23.549
- Do you like him?

36:27.553 --> 36:30.121
- I don't know what you mean.

36:30.422 --> 36:31.890
- He's about your age.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.725
He's nice-looking.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.462
Do you like him?

36:39.931 --> 36:44.303
- I just came here to get
something to eat

36:44.403 --> 36:49.275
and to relax after a very,
very long day,

36:49.375 --> 36:53.379
and a really, really
horrible week.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.157
- Another?

37:26.412 --> 37:28.447
- Where are you from?

37:29.348 --> 37:31.082
- Los Angeles.

37:31.182 --> 37:33.752
Well, it was Los Angeles.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.754
- Hollywood, huh?

37:36.455 --> 37:40.426
- Yeah. Moving back to Chicago,
though.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.260
- How come?

37:44.996 --> 37:47.599
- My boyfriend and I broke up.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.468
- Oh, right.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.304
Why?

37:54.640 --> 37:57.443
- I would rather
not talk about it.

38:01.647 --> 38:05.817
The bartender looks
just like him, my ex.

38:08.219 --> 38:11.222
That's really fun
for me right now.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.993
I'm just having
a really hard time.

38:16.795 --> 38:19.698
I feel like I'm
having a break down.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.869
- Your boyfriend,
he broke up with you?

38:26.538 --> 38:28.039
- Yeah.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.377
- He sounds dumb.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.579
- Thanks.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.650
- Was he rich?

38:39.217 --> 38:40.719
- Who, Eric?

38:40.819 --> 38:42.187
- The boyfriend.

38:42.388 --> 38:43.822
- God, no.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.924
He could barely
hold a steady job.

38:46.024 --> 38:48.494
I was paying for most
of our apartment.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.830
- Why'd you stay with him, then?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.202
- I loved him.

38:58.404 --> 39:00.572
We moved to L.A. together.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.510
We'd been together a long time.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.694
Do you have a girlfriend,

39:22.794 --> 39:25.196
or are you married, or whatever?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.299
- No.

39:30.902 --> 39:32.370
- Oh.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.377
- Women are a lot of work.

39:57.796 --> 40:01.600
- So, how long have you been a
mechanic?

40:03.234 --> 40:06.404
- 15 years, since I was a kid.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.508
- Wow! That's a long time.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.242
- Yup.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.112
- Do you own that place?

40:15.080 --> 40:17.583
- It was my dad's. He was a
mechanic.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.317
- Oh.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.253
- He left it to me when he died.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.623
- Oh. Sorry.

40:24.723 --> 40:28.126
- No, it's OK. He was an
asshole, anyway.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.438
He taught me there were a lot

40:30.462 --> 40:32.130
of other uses for car parts,

40:32.598 --> 40:34.933
mostly involving my face.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.313
- I can do what I want now,
though.

40:49.948 --> 40:54.820
I like working on old cars,
classics especially.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.888
Restoring them to their original
beauty.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.358
- Sounds cool.

41:00.526 --> 41:03.829
- Yeah. People nowadays are so
self-absorbed.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.397
They don't see what's
underneath.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.300
They don't want to do the work.

41:11.136 --> 41:15.541
I can't imagine buying a new
Toyota,

41:17.008 --> 41:18.810
big hunk of plastic.

41:19.745 --> 41:22.247
- I drive a Honda.

41:24.082 --> 41:26.718
- Yeah, I know. It's in my shop.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.755
- Oh, yeah, right.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.658
Oh, you know what?

41:32.758 --> 41:34.726
I need to use the pay phone.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.262
When was the last time I used a
pay phone?

41:37.362 --> 41:38.864
Geez.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.288
- Hey, Mom.

42:03.589 --> 42:06.892
I guess you're sleeping, it must
be pretty late there.

42:07.092 --> 42:10.261
What a day I have had!

42:10.729 --> 42:14.800
I lost my phone, so that was
fun,

42:14.900 --> 42:18.203
and then this crazy homeless
lady tried to attack me,

42:18.870 --> 42:20.639
then my car died.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.240
I'm thinking the Universe

42:22.340 --> 42:24.242
is trying to tell me something.

42:25.143 --> 42:30.148
I'm in, uh, I have no idea.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.549
I don't remember.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.484
I'm about five hours from L.A.

42:36.421 --> 42:38.590
So, yeah, my car broke down.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.660
It's at the mechanic's and it
will get fixed tomorrow,

42:43.228 --> 42:46.231
so now I just need to find a
place to stay the night,

42:46.331 --> 42:48.099
some roadside inn, I guess.

42:48.199 --> 42:50.235
I hope the motel's not too
disgusting.

42:51.002 --> 42:53.504
Anyway, love you.

42:53.972 --> 42:56.174
I'll try to find a cell phone
store tomorrow

42:56.274 --> 42:57.909
so I can buy a new phone, but...

42:58.009 --> 43:00.779
You know, if you call me don't
worry!

43:00.879 --> 43:02.948
I'm just back in 1995.

43:05.617 --> 43:07.585
OK. Bye.

43:37.716 --> 43:40.485
I cannot believe for the life of
me

43:40.585 --> 43:42.320
that you could do this to me!

43:43.121 --> 43:46.958
I have done so much for you in
the past three years!

43:47.058 --> 43:49.360
I have paid your rent for
months,

43:49.460 --> 43:51.029
and this is how you repay me?

43:51.129 --> 43:53.799
You cheat on me over and over?

43:53.899 --> 43:55.701
How could you do this?

43:56.134 --> 43:58.336
Like I am nothing!

43:59.337 --> 44:00.672
What is wrong with you?

44:00.772 --> 44:03.141
You are so selfish!

44:03.241 --> 44:05.143
I hate you!

44:05.243 --> 44:06.878
You have ruined my life!

44:07.645 --> 44:09.981
I hate you, you make me sick!

44:33.905 --> 44:36.207
- The sandwich is surprisingly
good, right?

44:41.346 --> 44:42.613
I mean, for a ham sandwich,

44:42.714 --> 44:47.618
I thought it was good.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.292
I should probably get going.

44:54.392 --> 44:57.262
I seem to keep putting my foot
in my mouth.

44:57.295 --> 44:59.264
- Yeah, that's good.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.704
- Oh, I'm so tired.

45:06.805 --> 45:10.041
Can I walk to the motel or do I
need to get a ride?

45:10.141 --> 45:11.542
- James will call you a cab.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.211
It's pretty far.

45:13.311 --> 45:15.413
The cab will cost you a couple
of bucks.

45:15.513 --> 45:16.782
- OK. Great.

45:17.983 --> 45:20.485
What time should I come get my
car tomorrow?

45:20.585 --> 45:22.287
- I'll let you know.

45:22.954 --> 45:25.590
- Oh. You'll have to call me at
the motel

45:25.690 --> 45:27.558
because I don't have a cell
phone.

45:28.426 --> 45:29.660
- OK.

45:37.769 --> 45:41.239
- Thank you. You know, for your
help.

45:41.339 --> 45:43.474
I'm really so grateful.

45:46.444 --> 45:48.847
Can I buy you another drink?

45:49.147 --> 45:51.116
- No, thanks.

46:03.862 --> 46:06.097
- Woah.

46:11.502 --> 46:13.171
Well, I'll just...

46:18.309 --> 46:20.946
I'll just wait...

46:21.779 --> 46:27.652
to hear from you at the motel.

46:32.390 --> 46:34.025
No rush.

46:36.194 --> 46:38.463
I'll just...

46:38.563 --> 46:40.331
I'll wait.

46:41.299 --> 46:46.737
I'll wait until I hear from you
to continue

46:46.838 --> 46:50.909
on my journey.

46:56.181 --> 47:01.652
These drinks must be really
strong.

47:02.854 --> 47:05.256
Can I get my check?

49:10.148 --> 49:11.516
- Claire?

49:14.685 --> 49:16.954
Why don't you come back now,
Claire?

49:19.190 --> 49:21.492
Where are you going to go, huh?

49:38.743 --> 49:40.678
Claire?

49:42.080 --> 49:44.182
Where are you?

49:48.053 --> 49:49.487
Honey,

49:50.088 --> 49:52.190
you have no car!

50:17.382 --> 50:18.549
Claire! Now remember,

50:18.649 --> 50:20.385
I know you don't have a phone!

50:40.138 --> 50:42.573
Oh, Claire?

50:43.774 --> 50:46.577
My darling, where are you?

50:52.283 --> 50:55.220
You have no car, don't forget
that!

51:12.603 --> 51:14.172
Claire?

51:16.974 --> 51:19.177
Oh, Claire, don't be scared.

51:21.279 --> 51:23.248
I just want to help you.

52:37.087 --> 52:39.190
Are you done playing now?

53:09.119 --> 53:11.121
- Would you like to go back to
your chair?

53:12.257 --> 53:13.591
Go!

53:20.130 --> 53:21.799
Sit down!

53:30.775 --> 53:32.042
- Thank you.

53:34.111 --> 53:35.780
You know,

53:37.815 --> 53:40.318
I've had a lot of girls in this
room.

53:40.418 --> 53:42.253
A lot of girls.

53:44.389 --> 53:46.457
I think you're my favorite,

53:47.057 --> 53:48.659
but we'll see.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.962
I haven't even started with you,
yet.

54:18.623 --> 54:21.091
Nice job with the rope, by the
way.

54:21.125 --> 54:23.661
That was a Boy Scout knot, a
sheetbend.

54:24.194 --> 54:26.931
Not easy to break out of, I
might add.

54:27.031 --> 54:29.199
Can you believe I was a Boy
Scout?

54:31.101 --> 54:32.637
A Tenderfoot.

54:33.871 --> 54:36.641
Never even made it to second
class.

54:39.444 --> 54:40.778
Oh, well.

54:41.512 --> 54:43.348
Nobody's perfect.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.522
Now, before I get started with
you,

54:52.390 --> 54:53.991
I wanted to ask you more about
why

54:54.091 --> 54:58.195
you are, or were, driving all
the way across country.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.233
Claire?

55:07.872 --> 55:09.173
Fine.

55:23.921 --> 55:27.324
- Oh, no! Stop it!

55:28.192 --> 55:33.230
Stop it, please! No!
No!

55:42.339 --> 55:45.576
- I asked you why you were
driving across country.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.915
- Because my boyfriend left me
for someone else

55:51.015 --> 55:52.883
and I wasn't making it as an
actress

55:52.983 --> 55:55.386
and I was sick of living in
L.A.! Satisfied?

55:55.486 --> 55:57.755
- So, you were running away. Is
that it?

55:57.855 --> 55:59.890
- I was not running away!

55:59.990 --> 56:01.926
- Well, it sure sounds like you
were.

56:11.636 --> 56:13.237
Your boyfriend,

56:16.607 --> 56:18.375
who did he leave you for?

56:18.476 --> 56:19.777
Was it someone younger?

56:19.877 --> 56:21.646
Someone prettier?

56:24.482 --> 56:26.451
Claire, you know the penalty

56:26.551 --> 56:28.786
for not answering my questions.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.321
- I don't know.

56:32.557 --> 56:33.724
She was younger.

56:33.824 --> 56:35.493
Yes, she was pretty.

56:35.593 --> 56:36.727
- Claire,

56:37.462 --> 56:39.664
I think you're very beautiful.

56:43.333 --> 56:46.937
Hey. I think your boyfriend was
stupid.

56:47.337 --> 56:49.239
Had you been together long?

56:51.108 --> 56:52.510
- Why are you doing this?

56:52.610 --> 56:54.445
- Answer the question!

56:54.979 --> 56:56.180
- Three years!

56:56.280 --> 56:58.816
- Three years. That's a long
time.

56:59.850 --> 57:01.852
Was he cheating on you?

57:02.687 --> 57:03.921
- Yes.

57:04.021 --> 57:05.823
- Awww.

57:06.591 --> 57:08.659
Poor little Claire,

57:08.759 --> 57:11.128
running away from her problems.

57:27.512 --> 57:30.014
Now, I'm going to untie you,

57:30.114 --> 57:32.316
but remember, I have a gun.

57:32.950 --> 57:34.819
I don't want to use it,

57:34.919 --> 57:36.854
but I will if you make me.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.972
- Oh, I wasn't going to let you
go.

57:55.139 --> 57:57.908
I was just going to give you a
little therapy.

57:59.810 --> 58:01.679
Take this knife.

58:02.179 --> 58:03.213
Go on,

58:03.313 --> 58:04.414
take it.

58:08.819 --> 58:13.023
Now, I want you to pretend your
thigh there

58:14.592 --> 58:16.260
is your ex-boyfriend.

58:16.360 --> 58:17.828
What was his name?

58:18.663 --> 58:20.064
Claire?

58:21.265 --> 58:23.367
What was your ex-boyfriend's
name?

58:23.467 --> 58:24.902
The cheater?

58:25.536 --> 58:27.271
What was his name?

58:27.572 --> 58:28.405
- Eric.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.074
- Eric, right, OK, Eric!

58:30.174 --> 58:32.843
Now, I want you to stab your leg
as hard as you can.

58:32.943 --> 58:33.943
Pretend it's Eric.

58:34.979 --> 58:37.057
Now, if I feel you're not doing
this with the passion

58:37.081 --> 58:39.416
and force necessary for this
little exercise to work, well

58:39.516 --> 58:41.418
then, I'm going to shoot you in
your leg.

58:44.555 --> 58:47.758
So, it's your choice.

58:48.759 --> 58:51.862
One leg, or two?

58:54.565 --> 58:58.202
Trust me, it will be a lot
easier this way.

59:00.771 --> 59:03.240
Oh, no no no no no no no.

59:03.340 --> 59:06.977
Right there, Claire. Your leg.

59:07.077 --> 59:09.079
I'm going to count to three.

59:10.414 --> 59:13.217
And I want you to visualize
Eric's face.

59:13.317 --> 59:15.152
Trust me, it'll make it a lot
easier.

59:15.252 --> 59:18.255
Oh! Visualize them fucking!

59:20.625 --> 59:22.392
You're going to have to get up
in the air

59:22.492 --> 59:24.829
with that knife in order to get
any good penetration.

59:26.296 --> 59:28.999
Do it! Pretend it's that
asshole's face!

59:31.969 --> 59:33.570
One!

59:40.244 --> 59:41.679
Two!

59:50.655 --> 59:51.989
Three!

59:55.025 --> 59:56.193
- Good! Great!

59:56.293 --> 59:56.994
How did that feel?

59:57.094 --> 59:58.829
Don't you feel better?

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:07.371
- What did you do that for?

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:09.173
Now I have to stop the bleeding.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.684
- That wasn't very smart.

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:28.859
You know, I don't know how clean
that knife was.

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:30.519
We should probably put something
on this

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.562
to make sure it doesn't get
infected.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.113
- You have very nice legs,
Claire.

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:43.533
- Shhh. It's OK, it's OK.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:46.036
It's to clean the wound.

01:01:55.746 --> 01:01:57.982
I think you're very brave.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:21.806
Looks like your jeans had a
stain.

01:02:37.822 --> 01:02:40.157
You know, you wear a lot of
makeup.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:43.794
Do you do that for men?

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:44.894
To get attention?

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.330
To get your way?

01:02:47.364 --> 01:02:49.599
Is that why you flirted with me?

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.602
To get your car fixed for
cheaper?

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.007
Did you flirt with me

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.043
to get your car fixed for
cheaper?

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.045
Answer me, Claire!

01:03:01.145 --> 01:03:02.779
- I didn't flirt!

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:05.950
- Oh, I think you did.

01:03:06.884 --> 01:03:08.886
And it worked.

01:03:14.224 --> 01:03:16.360
You wear your fancy makeup,

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:18.362
your long, styled hair,

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.197
your painted up nails.

01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:23.901
You do that for men, not you,
don't you?

01:03:26.070 --> 01:03:27.504
- No.

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:29.874
- I don't believe you.

01:03:29.974 --> 01:03:31.075
- I don't!

01:03:31.175 --> 01:03:32.576
- You flirted with me!

01:03:32.676 --> 01:03:35.212
- I didn't flirt! I was being
nice.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:36.346
You helped me!

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.882
- No, I'll help you!

01:03:37.982 --> 01:03:39.316
You need someone to help you!

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:40.750
It's written all over your face!

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.896
Your boyfriend, he stopped
giving you attention.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:56.700
I'll give you attention.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.436
I will give you lots of
attention!

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:27.264
Wipe off all your makeup!
- What?

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.032
Wipe it off!

01:04:28.132 --> 01:04:29.375
I want to see what you look like

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:30.639
when you're not all painted up!

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:37.874
More. I can still see your eye
makeup.

01:04:37.975 --> 01:04:39.743
You look like a damn raccoon.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:42.246
More!

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:54.758
- There.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.063
That's better.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.768
Look at how much better you
look.

01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.239
Quite an improvement, if you ask
me.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:17.081
I like seeing the real you.

01:05:53.283 --> 01:05:54.784
Now what?

01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:59.356
I think we cut off that pretty
hair of yours.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:00.456
What do you think?

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:02.391
I think it will look so much
better.

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:05.073
I mean, you can't hide behind
your long hair forever.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:09.166
- Please, just let me go.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.170
- This is the
bargaining phase. Go on.

01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.540
- Please! I won't tell anyone.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.342
Please, just let me go.

01:06:18.442 --> 01:06:19.976
- Let you go?

01:06:20.077 --> 01:06:21.878
Why?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.880
We are having so much fun!

01:06:24.748 --> 01:06:28.718
- Please, I just want to go
home.

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.857
- But I haven't finished helping
you yet.

01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:37.827
- You've helped me. Please!

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:42.566
- Yep. Definitely the bargaining
phase.

01:06:43.067 --> 01:06:45.435
Happens all the time when I try
to help people.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.037
- Please!

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:49.839
- Where was I?

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:51.341
Oh! Right!

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.543
Time for your new look.

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:04.454
- You know, you do have very
pretty hair.

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.724
But your hair
shouldn't define you.

01:07:35.085 --> 01:07:37.421
Well, well, well...

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:40.124
I think this new look suits you!

01:07:40.224 --> 01:07:41.725
Would you like to see?

01:07:42.892 --> 01:07:45.095
Let me get you a mirror.

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:05.649
Objects in mirror may be closer
than they appear.

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:08.818
Bad joke. I had to.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.757
Honestly, I think
it looks great.

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:17.527
You're very pretty, even without
all that stuff.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:20.663
No thoughts on the new haircut?

01:08:20.764 --> 01:08:22.366
That's all I get?

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.001
- I don't care.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.304
- You don't care that you have
short hair?

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:30.374
Now we're getting somewhere!

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:32.041
- I don't care!

01:08:32.142 --> 01:08:34.211
- This much be the fearless
stage.

01:08:35.312 --> 01:08:36.645
- Fuck you!

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.448
- Yep! Definitely the fearless
stage.

01:08:38.548 --> 01:08:39.725
You think the end is imminent,

01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:40.817
so you don't care anymore!

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:43.051
You think you have nothing to
lose!

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.888
- Go to Hell, you fucking
psycho!

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:46.656
- You do have something to lose,
Claire!

01:08:46.756 --> 01:08:48.292
I would watch yourself!

01:08:48.392 --> 01:08:50.294
- You make me sick.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:54.798
- Ah. Well, I guess we aren't
friends anymore.

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.066
- Doubt you have any friends!

01:08:57.167 --> 01:09:00.036
- Oooo, that was a good one,
Claire!

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.538
I'm all torn up inside!

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.073
You're right.

01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:09.246
I am a bit of a loner.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.314
It's true.

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:18.154
But this is my sanctuary,

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.589
where I feel most comfortable,

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:20.557
where I'm the boss!

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:22.492
So where was I?

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.363
That's right.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.334
Your nails.

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.204
Sorry to have to tell you this,
Claire,

01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:59.796
but this next experience might
not be

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:02.131
as pleasurable as your last two.

01:10:10.540 --> 01:10:12.208
I will use this.

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:14.110
I've done it before.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.146
I was hoping with you I wouldn't
have to.

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:20.917
I like you.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.987
You're different than the rest.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.117
- Why are you tying up my feet?

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:55.257
- You see, Claire,

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.153
I don't have nail polish
remover.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.422
I mean, look at me.

01:10:58.522 --> 01:10:59.589
Why would I?

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:01.458
The closest thing I could think
of

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:04.328
is acid.

01:11:04.794 --> 01:11:06.763
It sure takes the paint off
cars.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:08.073
I figured it would probably do
the job

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.099
on your fingers and toes-ies.

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.936
No! Please, no!

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:19.008
- I see you've left the fearless
stage.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:20.444
That's good.

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:23.046
I would rather work with you
than against you.

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:25.615
- Please, Eddie, please!

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.384
Don't do this!

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:28.484
- Don't you dare think

01:11:28.552 --> 01:11:30.987
about flirting with me unless
you mean it!

01:11:33.156 --> 01:11:35.359
Now, take a deep breath.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.463
This might sting a little.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:46.670
- Almost there, almost there.

01:12:00.183 --> 01:12:01.585
- The good news is,

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:02.819
is the polish came off,

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:04.521
I knew it would!

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:07.491
The bad news is that your nails
came off with it.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:14.030
- We do what we can with what he
have, I guess.

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:23.172
- Eddie, can we please talk for
a minute.

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.208
I think that you have made

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:27.744
some very good points today
about me

01:12:27.844 --> 01:12:29.879
and the way I am.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:32.348
- You really think I'm going to
fall for that?

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:34.384
- I'm serious.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:40.590
I have been living a lie,
putting on an act,

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:48.364
living for a man, not focusing
on myself.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:52.068
- I don't believe you.

01:12:53.637 --> 01:12:57.774
- I have been hiding behind a
mask,

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:01.611
not showing my true self.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.647
I have been running from my
problems

01:13:03.747 --> 01:13:05.449
and my feelings.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:09.152
You have helped me to see that
now.

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:10.720
- I have?

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:12.922
- Yes.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.459
- I think you just don't

01:13:15.559 --> 01:13:17.827
want me to take the nail polish
off your feet!

01:13:19.463 --> 01:13:22.666
- Did I say anything about the
haircut?

01:13:22.766 --> 01:13:24.333
Did I make a sound?

01:13:24.434 --> 01:13:26.135
- Not at first.

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:32.509
- I was warming up to this new
way of thinking.

01:13:39.248 --> 01:13:41.084
- Prove it.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.325
- Untie me.

01:14:42.812 --> 01:14:45.148
I was living a lie.

01:14:45.982 --> 01:14:48.051
- This is a trick.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.196
- Did that feel like a trick?

01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:02.666
- No.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.602
- I have to say, though,

01:15:05.702 --> 01:15:07.170
I'm starving.

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:09.939
Can we go somewhere?

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.908
- Starving? Really?

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:13.743
- Yeah.

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:15.612
- It's so late.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.281
- I know.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:26.255
- Be quiet! Don't you make a
sound.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.558
Go right over there, I don't
trust you yet.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.374
Hey, Gus.

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:46.610
What are you doing?

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.830
Do you know what time it is?

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:49.746
- Sorry to bother you,
Eddie, but...

01:15:49.846 --> 01:15:51.314
What are you, sleeping in here?

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:54.083
- Yeah, I was working on
a car and it got late.

01:15:54.183 --> 01:15:57.220
I have a cot out here for
sometimes when it gets late.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.088
- Oh, yeah, of course.

01:15:59.188 --> 01:16:01.958
Well, reason I stopped by is

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:03.927
that girl I brought over here
earlier.

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:05.629
I called the hotel because I
figured

01:16:05.729 --> 01:16:07.330
she would be staying overnight
and all.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.241
I just wanted to check and see
if she's all right.

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:11.267
- Yeah, I haven't seen
her since earlier.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.970
- Yeah, see, I called the hotel

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:15.414
and they said she never checked
in,

01:16:15.438 --> 01:16:17.440
so, you know, I've got a young
daughter myself,

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:18.580
so I got a little worried.

01:16:19.008 --> 01:16:20.052
Just wanted to see if she's all
right.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.876
- Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.748
- I see her car's still here

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:26.950
so she's got to be in town
somewhere, right?

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:30.019
- Maybe she met someone
at the bar tonight.

01:16:30.954 --> 01:16:32.789
- Maybe. She doesn't seem

01:16:32.889 --> 01:16:34.423
like that kind of girl to me.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:35.601
- Well, Gus, you never know

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:37.260
what kind of girl someone is.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.995
- Can I come in?

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.840
- I'd really like to go
back to sleep.

01:16:40.864 --> 01:16:42.632
I was up pretty late.

01:16:42.966 --> 01:16:45.635
- Is that her purse over there?

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:46.835
Claire!

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:48.337
- Goddammit!

01:16:48.504 --> 01:16:49.372
Gus, get back here!

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:50.840
- Claire!

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:52.308
- Gus, help me!

01:16:52.408 --> 01:16:54.043
Get me out of here!

01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.849
Eddie, don't do this.

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.384
- Why did you come here?

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.398
- What the hell's wrong with
you?

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:05.097
You ain't right in the head,
man.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:06.823
We've got to get you some help.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:08.692
- I don't need help.

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:11.394
Everyone else needs help.

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:25.842
- No!

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:27.911
Why did you kill him?

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:28.812
- I had to!

01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:29.713
I'm not going to jail!

01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:30.980
No more jails!

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.648
- You didn't have to kill him!

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.050
- Why did you yell?

01:17:34.884 --> 01:17:36.419
You made me kill him!

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:38.755
It's your fault.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.592
- I just want to go home!

01:17:44.227 --> 01:17:46.095
- Oh, Claire.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.446
Ow! Why?

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:40.716
- Why? Are you fucking crazy?

01:18:40.817 --> 01:18:44.487
- I'm not crazy! I saw something
in you.

01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:46.790
I wanted to make you stronger.

01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:48.557
- By holding me hostage?

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.059
- By stripping you of your mask

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:52.996
and making you feel pain you
needed to feel.

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.431
- You are crazy!

01:18:56.299 --> 01:18:57.901
- Am I?

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.837
Look at how much stronger you
are.

01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.776
I did that for you.
