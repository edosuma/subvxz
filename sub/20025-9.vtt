WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.574 --> 00:12.045
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:15.615 --> 00:19.486
It's not all been one big party.
Back to work.

00:19.552 --> 00:22.188
We've had to work for
that wrinkly fuck, Anna.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.559
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.626 --> 00:28.128
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:31.064 --> 00:34.000
Only gone and made her business
a global success.

00:35.235 --> 00:38.338
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:38.405 --> 00:39.406
(woman) Oy, oy.

00:39.472 --> 00:42.142
Aaah!
(Nathan) Hiya!

00:42.208 --> 00:43.877
(all cheer)

00:48.248 --> 00:49.949
(screaming)

00:50.016 --> 00:52.352
I'm not gonna keep youse all on
full-time.

00:53.153 --> 00:57.824
We need to help Anna decide
who stays and who goes.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.026
(cheering)

01:00.093 --> 01:02.362
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.429 --> 01:05.131
Are they fucking radge enough?

01:05.197 --> 01:07.867
To join this crazy family?

01:13.973 --> 01:15.608
Let wuh fucking gan!

01:16.743 --> 01:19.579
(Chloe cheers, all exclaim)

01:19.646 --> 01:21.815
It's always good
to see Marnie's face.

01:21.881 --> 01:24.184
(screams)
Ah!

01:24.250 --> 01:26.186
I'm really into Scott.

01:28.188 --> 01:31.458
I am in full swing tonight.
I can't wait!

01:31.524 --> 01:34.627
Fuck me.
Has she just swilled Aaron?

01:34.694 --> 01:37.730
(Anna) 'Let us know
who's the strongest workers.'

01:37.797 --> 01:40.400
'I only want the best
back in Newcastle.'

01:40.467 --> 01:43.203
None of wuh can agree.
This is gonna be difficult.

01:47.974 --> 01:51.778
Sarah's pledging her love to us.
I'm not gonna sack her off.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.213
Mans has to have options.

01:53.279 --> 01:56.549
If we're such good friends,
you'd have more respect for me.

01:56.616 --> 02:00.253
I'm living with two exes. I have
to go on like I'm fine about it.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.855
Ah! Fuck!

02:04.757 --> 02:09.127
Gaz, tomorrow me and you are
going on the fucking pull.

02:12.565 --> 02:14.801
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.170
I'd never kiss
anyone without a six-pack.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.906
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.342
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:22.408 --> 02:24.444
I'm preened to perfection.

02:24.511 --> 02:26.880
I'm totally crackers me, like.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.682
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:29.749 --> 02:32.652
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.488
My quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.591
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:50.603 --> 02:52.338
(Scott) Hi.

02:52.405 --> 02:55.108
(Abbie) I wake up
and Scott's next to us.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.778
We didn't have sex,
but I had fun. I hope he did, too.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.213
How you feeling?

03:00.280 --> 03:02.782
All right. You?
(yawns)

03:02.849 --> 03:05.451
I never realised
how good Abbie was at maths.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.187
She managed to times one by one
and end up with 69.

03:08.254 --> 03:11.524
I hope she's ready for
extra-long division

03:11.591 --> 03:13.226
with no fucking remainder.

03:13.293 --> 03:18.698
I'm gonna get up, have a coffee.
Wash me cock.

03:18.765 --> 03:21.067
(laughs)

03:22.936 --> 03:26.005
Why did you sleep in your clothes?
Put this on this morning.

03:26.072 --> 03:29.776
I feel like
I've been hit by a bus.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.844
What was I drinking last night?

03:31.911 --> 03:34.547
You poured a full drink over
Aaron's head.

03:34.614 --> 03:35.882
(laughs)

03:35.949 --> 03:39.285
Not...
No, you were next to him, like...

03:39.352 --> 03:42.255
I don't think Marnie will admit
why she swilled Aaron,

03:42.322 --> 03:44.724
It's obvious there's still
feelings there.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.560
It was attention seeking.
Fucking hell.

03:47.627 --> 03:50.730
That's attention seeking
to the max. (laughs)

03:55.335 --> 03:59.439
It'll be wicked today. What are
you gonna do if Marnie's with wuh?

03:59.505 --> 04:04.043
Marnie might have thought it was
joke, but it was the last straw.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.246
It was what I needed
to move on from her.

04:07.313 --> 04:10.617
There was no way you were gonna
pull last night.

04:10.683 --> 04:14.220
After everything Marnie's done,
I've wanted to be her friend,

04:14.287 --> 04:18.124
but after swilling us, fuck it,
tonight, I'm going on the pull.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.225
Let's get ready.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.527
Argh!

04:23.630 --> 04:25.798
(Marty) Oh!
(Chloe) This is nice.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.701
Waking up as pals.
Best of mates.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.572
I've woken up next to Marty
and we haven't even shagged.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.140
I've changed, me, like.

04:34.207 --> 04:38.077
I'm happy that me and you
are getting on.

04:38.144 --> 04:41.681
It's better for everyone else.
I know.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.283
Me and Chloe being friends
is gonna take work,

04:44.350 --> 04:46.219
cos there's still feelings there.

04:46.285 --> 04:49.122
We're in a new position
and it's not a shagging one.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.890
Fuck off, then.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.091
Yeah, I'm going.

04:52.158 --> 04:56.362
Didn't want to stay any longer,
cos you stink.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.336
Oh! Full squad.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.638
Great. Here comes Scott.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.908
I can't wait to hear about
his night of passion with Abbie.

05:10.877 --> 05:11.878
(Scott laughs)

05:13.079 --> 05:16.215
The lads are bantering about
Abbie sucking Scott's dick.

05:16.282 --> 05:19.819
It's a bit of a liberty
rubbing it in my face,

05:19.886 --> 05:21.721
especially in front of everyone.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.123
(mobile phone rings)
(Marnie) The phone!

05:24.190 --> 05:27.060
(Marty) The phone's
fucking ringing!

05:27.126 --> 05:31.164
The phone rings, it's gonna be
Anna. What does she want?

05:31.230 --> 05:34.567
(Anna) "I hope youse are
looking after the chalet."

05:34.634 --> 05:38.204
Of course, Anna.
"I've got a job for youse later."

05:38.271 --> 05:40.640
Right. OK.
"You, Gary and the newbies

05:40.707 --> 05:45.445
are gonna work tonight, a Geordie
Tours event I want you to run."

05:45.511 --> 05:48.247
Right. Sound.
Oh, God.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.784
"Make sure that you look after
all the punters, OK?"

05:51.851 --> 05:52.852
No worries, Anna.

05:52.919 --> 05:54.487
This is fucking perfect.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.857
I'm going to work, Gaz is there.
He's me wingman.

05:57.924 --> 06:01.027
There'll be loadsa birds.
I guarantee, we're on the pull.

06:01.094 --> 06:05.665
Right, so snowboarding today,
work tonight.

06:05.732 --> 06:09.135
I've got an idea for something
really fun to do today.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.171
I feel sorry for Abbie,
so I'll take her with me

06:12.238 --> 06:15.174
and have a pep talk with her,
away from Sarah.

06:15.241 --> 06:18.044
I'm gonna take Chloe,
Zahida and Abbie with me.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.213
We're gonna go husky riding!

06:20.279 --> 06:22.148
Oh!
Oh, get in!

06:22.215 --> 06:26.052
I am buzzing Nathan's chosen us
to go husky riding.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.854
But Sarah isn't coming.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.758
I don't know whether that's
good or bad cos we need to speak.

06:34.761 --> 06:36.696
Come on!
(Chloe) I cannot wait

06:36.763 --> 06:38.131
to go husky riding.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.767
I've been practising
how to talk dog.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.502
(howls)

06:42.568 --> 06:44.604
(Chloe's howling echoes)

06:47.273 --> 06:49.709
(Nathan) Bonjour.
Hello.

06:51.010 --> 06:53.446
Do they enjoy it?
Yes.

06:53.513 --> 06:57.283
I'm not gonna lie, I'm scared
about how fast it's gonna go.

06:57.350 --> 07:00.820
There's no seatbelts. What if
I fall out and break me arm?

07:00.887 --> 07:03.356
(Nathan) Go!

07:05.491 --> 07:07.527
(barking)

07:08.828 --> 07:10.563
(cheers)
(whooping)

07:14.066 --> 07:15.301
Too heavy for them.

07:15.368 --> 07:18.638
We get to a hill, and the dogs
are struggling to get us up.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.940
I was buzzing that
Nathan chose us,

07:21.007 --> 07:22.975
but now he's weighing us down.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.678
(Chloe laughs and whoops)

07:26.679 --> 07:29.549
Youse! We keep stopping
cos I'm too heavy.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.851
Thank God I'm not going
with Nathan.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.387
His fat arse
would slow us right down.

07:34.453 --> 07:37.356
(Abbie) Have you farted?
(Nathan) It's one of the dogs.

07:39.325 --> 07:42.361
Whooo!
Whoo!

07:46.332 --> 07:49.902
Stop smelling my vagina.
It's cos it smells of fish.

07:49.969 --> 07:54.173
I haven't washed this morning.
Got a fucking kipper down there.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.244
Speaking of kippers, what
happened between you and Scott?

07:58.311 --> 08:02.181
Me and Nathan are cuddling the
huskies. It doesn't take him long

08:02.248 --> 08:05.184
to start asking what's going on
between me and Scott.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.854
Obviously, I got the finger.
Again?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.822
Yeah.
You love getting fingered.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.858
(laughs)
Better call you "Puppet".

08:11.924 --> 08:13.893
We did a 69, as well.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.863
He licked you out,
you sucked him off? Yeah.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.131
Abbie, to me, is a bit dim.

08:19.198 --> 08:23.002
I didn't know she could count
to 69, let alone do one.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.904
Have you spoke to Sarah?

08:24.971 --> 08:29.442
I wanted to speak to her, but she
didn't look in the best of moods.

08:29.508 --> 08:34.447
I didn't want to ruin another
night. Just leave it for now.

08:34.513 --> 08:37.515
The sooner youse make up,
the better it's gonna be.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.019
We've still got
a decision to make.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.822
It's hard,
youse are the best of the best.

08:42.889 --> 08:47.226
I don't want this drama to affect
our decisions.

08:47.293 --> 08:50.763
Us originals are gonna have to
report back to Anna

08:50.830 --> 08:54.700
on who we want to live with. I
don't want Abbie judged on this.

08:54.767 --> 08:58.237
Hopefully, we can judge her on
how well she deals with this.

08:58.304 --> 09:00.506
Look at the size of his chopper.

09:07.113 --> 09:08.414
(Sophie laughing)

09:08.481 --> 09:10.850
(man) Watch out! Watch out!

09:13.586 --> 09:17.356
Fucking hell, Sophie's just wiped
out coming down that slope.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.593
I'm sticking to the baby slopes.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.965
(Aaron) Put your feet together.
(Marnie laughs, gasps)

09:26.032 --> 09:28.301
Aaron's being Marnie's instructor.

09:28.367 --> 09:32.338
If instructors touched me like
that, I'd tell them to fuck off.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.308
(Aaron)
One second, Marn. (laughs)

09:35.374 --> 09:37.877
(Marnie laughs)

09:37.944 --> 09:41.547
I might be shit at skiing, but at
least Aaron's being OK with us.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.517
I thought he'd be
in a huff still.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.386
(Sophie) Turn.
Control it. Slower.

09:47.453 --> 09:50.256
Slower. Control it. Control it.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.757
I'm trying! Ah!

09:51.824 --> 09:52.858
Whoa!

09:52.925 --> 09:54.927
(laughing)

10:05.204 --> 10:09.308
(Sophie) There's our lads,
there's our lads. No broken legs.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.812
I've had a wicked day on the snow.
It's time to get back

10:12.878 --> 10:15.681
so Gaz and Aaron can take
the newbies to work,

10:15.748 --> 10:17.650
while the rest of wuh gan out.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.796
Should I shave?
Ngh! Yeah.

10:30.863 --> 10:35.167
Hope there's some fit birds there.
My priority is to wingman Aaron.

10:35.234 --> 10:38.304
I want him to get over Marnie.
Aye. Definitely.

10:38.371 --> 10:42.174
I'm excited to get out with not
having fucking watching eyes on us.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.477
Chloe's not there,
None of the wolf pack.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.613
Tonight is perfect to pull.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.383
I can meet a bird without Marnie
cock blocking us.

10:50.449 --> 10:52.785
I am fucking buzzing
for this night.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.089
Abbie, are you going on the pull?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.524
I'm not hunting, no.

10:58.591 --> 11:02.762
We're getting ready for work. You
can cut the tension with a knife.

11:02.828 --> 11:06.732
I hope we can forget about it,
for the sake of work.

11:06.799 --> 11:10.269
What if you see someone
that you fancy more than Scott?

11:11.270 --> 11:14.974
I don't know.
I don't wanna wreck anything.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.809
I'm just gonna, just chill.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.979
I can't believe that Abbie
still hasn't said anything

11:20.046 --> 11:21.647
about her getting with Scott.

11:21.714 --> 11:24.717
She knew that I liked him.
I kissed him first.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.953
If she wants to be mates,
she'll have to apologise.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.123
(Scotty T)
# We are going to work #

11:35.528 --> 11:38.998
I can't believe they've had a 69.
That is so intimate.

11:39.065 --> 11:42.401
Your vagina and your arsehole
is on someone's face, like...

11:42.468 --> 11:44.437
It must be just so clean.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.540
I love a 69,
but I always wipe first.

11:47.606 --> 11:51.143
I'd never do it on a first date.
Or would I?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.679
I'm finding it hard
about this whole...

11:53.746 --> 11:57.983
We've got to remember, Anna wants
people we want to stay, as well.

11:58.050 --> 12:02.655
Sorry, rule number one is never
stab your best mate in the back.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.958
Stick up for your best friend.
Even if they're wrong?

12:06.025 --> 12:09.361
What Abbie's done to Sarah
has changed me opinion on her.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.664
This could jeopardise her place.

12:13.966 --> 12:17.103
I'm gonna let Abbie lead this one
cos she's shit.

12:17.169 --> 12:19.572
Sarah and Zahida
aren't speaking to us.

12:19.638 --> 12:21.373
Tonight could be messy.

12:21.440 --> 12:22.508
(Gaz) Go on, son!

12:26.245 --> 12:27.813
This can't go on any longer.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.584
Marnie is on a rampage tonight.
She's all over us.

12:31.650 --> 12:33.953
She can grind on
whoever she wants.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.956
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:38.991 --> 12:39.191
.

12:41.727 --> 12:41.927
.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.805
We're putting on Geordie Tours.

12:52.872 --> 12:55.641
We'll entertain these
clients with party games.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.842
It's gonna be mint.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.811
Don't do your shot yet.

12:58.878 --> 13:01.480
We get to work. We need to impress.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.583
I want to show Gary and Aaron
how fun I can be,

13:04.650 --> 13:07.052
and that I'm the person
they want to live with.

13:07.119 --> 13:10.389
Everyone,
welcome to Geordie Tours!

13:10.456 --> 13:12.691
We're going to be
playing drinking games.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.094
Sam takes that leadership role.

13:15.161 --> 13:17.263
Walks in and gets the party started.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.998
Everyone's gonna have a shot.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.467
I want your favourite
French swear word.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.003
What's that mean?

13:25.171 --> 13:26.305
Hey-hey!

13:26.372 --> 13:29.108
(Aaron) Sam's the only one
that wants to stay.

13:29.175 --> 13:32.845
He's introducing the games
and he's getting involved.

13:32.912 --> 13:37.216
Right, everyone, shut up! (laughs)

13:37.283 --> 13:39.518
We're gonna play Pass the Sausage.

13:39.585 --> 13:42.488
Mine and Sarah's game
is Pass the Sausage.

13:43.689 --> 13:46.258
Everyone's loving it.
It's hilarious.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.727
Abbie,
this is how you run a game.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.129
(cheering)

13:50.196 --> 13:51.997
YEAH!
(all cheer)

13:53.232 --> 13:56.368
I'll let Abbie lead this one,
she's a bit shit.

13:56.435 --> 13:58.204
At work, it's awkward.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.773
Sarah and Zahida aren't even
speaking to us.

14:00.839 --> 14:03.976
I'm gonna focus on work
and sort it out later.

14:04.043 --> 14:08.347
This next game is who can fit the
most snow in these little boxers.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.983
This game is called
Snow in Your Pants.

14:11.050 --> 14:15.120
I just want to put snow in
people's pants.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.256
(cheering)

14:22.795 --> 14:25.097
I see Zahida and Sarah
looking at Abbie,

14:25.164 --> 14:27.700
they're not impressed
with the Scott thing,

14:27.766 --> 14:29.602
but it's not the time or place.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.203
(all cheering)

14:36.508 --> 14:39.345
(Scotty T)
I wonder when the newbies get here.

14:39.411 --> 14:42.581
If Anna wants me to put them
through their paces, I will!

14:42.648 --> 14:44.883
(Sophie) Everyone!

14:45.951 --> 14:48.387
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

14:48.454 --> 14:50.956
Brace yourselves,
we're about to get fucked up.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.591
Tonight could be messy.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.668
(Aaron) This place
is full of posh birds.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.938
They love a bit of rough,
so I'm gonna clean up.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.940
Where are you from?

15:08.007 --> 15:10.509
(indistinct)
Do you work here?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.445
Let's get down to
the nitty gritty.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.614
Aaron. Girls.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.285
If me and you can neck this shot
successfully,

15:19.351 --> 15:21.920
them two have got to neck on.
Cheers.

15:21.987 --> 15:25.491
Gaz is playing this game.
If him and her friend drink,

15:25.557 --> 15:29.828
me and this girl have to neck on.
That sounds like a wicked game.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.997
Whoo!
(laughs)

15:32.064 --> 15:33.866
No!
Shot done!

15:33.932 --> 15:36.135
Now, Aaron, kiss the fucking girl.

15:37.202 --> 15:38.203
Go on, son!

15:38.270 --> 15:42.574
This is what I'm talking about.
Gaz's game has worked a treat.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.680
Work's amazing.
Newbies smashed it, Aaron pulled.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.815
Let's get to the club
and carry on.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.050
Bye, everyone!

15:51.116 --> 15:52.518
(all bid farewell)

16:02.695 --> 16:04.997
(Marty) Ah!
(Scotty T) Ah!

16:05.064 --> 16:07.900
We get to the club,
the others are there.

16:07.966 --> 16:11.203
I've pulled at work. I hope to
carry that on. Hopefully,

16:11.270 --> 16:14.673
one of these girls I've been
chatting to will come to the club.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.247
Aaron's just got back from work
and he hasn't said hello.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.782
Why is he acting weird?

16:23.849 --> 16:26.585
If he's gonna do this,
it'll make me act strange.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.154
I'll let him get on with it.
I can't be bothered.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.797
I've told Sarah she needs to
make up with Abbie.

16:38.864 --> 16:42.201
To be in this family,
you need to learn to talk.

16:42.267 --> 16:44.436
There's no time like the present.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.205
Abbie!

16:46.271 --> 16:49.108
Chloe is pulling us over
to talk to Sarah.

16:49.174 --> 16:53.679
I need to sort things out.
This can't go on any longer.

16:59.151 --> 17:03.455
Abbie's saying that I didn't tell
her I liked Scott from the start.

17:03.522 --> 17:06.290
I kissed him first.
What does that tell ya?

17:10.396 --> 17:13.999
Sarah is going in on us.
I feel so bad.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.935
I like Scott and he said
he likes me.

17:17.002 --> 17:19.238
I can't cut it off.
I'm in too deep.

17:22.641 --> 17:23.942
I really like Scott,

17:24.009 --> 17:27.880
but the only way things can move
forward between me and Sarah

17:27.945 --> 17:29.748
is if I stay away from Scott

17:29.815 --> 17:31.950
and wait for things
to settle down.

17:38.690 --> 17:43.295
I'm having a wicked time, when I
see one of the girls from work.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.264
I'll ask her to join wuh.

17:48.867 --> 17:52.905
Aaron's brought a girl over
and everyone's eyes are on me.

17:52.971 --> 17:57.242
Everyone's waiting for us to
react, but I don't care.

17:59.745 --> 18:02.347
What's this? Aaron's necking on
with a bird.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.818
His game for pulling lasses
was the same as his snowboarding.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.853
Absolutely fucking shite.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.323
Oh, necking on!

18:11.390 --> 18:15.327
Aaron's pulled a girl,
and Marnie is affected by it,

18:15.394 --> 18:17.663
but she's keeping
all her emotions in.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.531
She still cares about him.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.173
Aaron's pulled that girl,
everyone's looking at me.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.877
I'm sick of it. Fuck it. I'll give
youse something to look at.

18:34.513 --> 18:37.916
I can see Marnie trying to get
me attention,

18:37.983 --> 18:40.118
and I couldn't give a fuck.

18:40.185 --> 18:43.722
She can grind on whoever she
wants, I've found a fittie.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.891
Me and her
are having a wicked time.

18:49.127 --> 18:52.331
Marnie's on a rampage tonight.
She's all over us.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.266
It's obviously to get at Aaron,

18:54.333 --> 18:56.268
but you don't hear me
complaining.

18:56.335 --> 18:59.304
Oh. I didn't look.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.406
Marnie wants Aaron to move on,

19:01.473 --> 19:03.909
and her having to see Aaron
pull a random

19:03.976 --> 19:05.911
has made her a little jealous.

19:07.946 --> 19:11.617
I can't tell if Marnie's upset
or trying to make a scene.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.186
This girl wants to come
to the chalet,

19:14.253 --> 19:16.788
so I'm gonna get her outta here,
sharpish.

19:32.771 --> 19:35.374
Me and Marty
are getting on so well.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.342
We're having a dance, a banter.

19:37.409 --> 19:41.613
We're really good friends, and I
want it to stay like this forever.

19:43.248 --> 19:45.817
Once again, Chloe is
spending time with Marty

19:45.884 --> 19:47.786
and she's forgot about me already.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.056
But I'm proud of her,
cos her and Marty are friends,

19:51.123 --> 19:53.725
which means no more kick-offs
every night.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.932
This is the first time
me and Chloe have been just pals.

19:59.998 --> 20:03.168
We're in a good place.
I don't want it to change.

20:06.104 --> 20:08.607
Tonight has been so eventful.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.809
Aaron has finally pulled a bird,

20:10.876 --> 20:14.346
Marnie's danced on Sam,
what the fuck is going on?

20:14.413 --> 20:16.949
Let's get to the chalet
for pizza.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.083
(laughing) NO!

20:24.890 --> 20:26.725
I'm not messing around.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.962
This girl is going straight to
the Shag Pad.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.176
When I thought the night
couldn't get weirder,

20:44.242 --> 20:47.613
Aaron's in the Shag Pad with a bird.
Hope she's good at cleaning.

20:47.679 --> 20:51.316
She'll have to get through a
layer of dust to get to his cock.

20:59.691 --> 21:03.228
I know Aaron's pulled a girl.
They left the club together.

21:03.295 --> 21:07.666
Everyone's expecting us to care,
but the truth is, I don't.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.935
Me and Aaron are friends
and I'm happy.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.645
(Abbie) Tonight has been awful.

21:19.711 --> 21:23.448
Scott is acting weird,
and Sarah went in on us.

21:23.515 --> 21:26.652
I want to get away from everyone
and get to bed.

21:37.129 --> 21:41.199
It's the perfect opportunity
to soften things up with Sarah.

21:41.266 --> 21:44.202
It's the last chance at any action
I'll get tonight.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.871
Mans is horny as fuck.

21:53.078 --> 21:56.214
Abbie shouldn't have got with
Scott in the first place.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.517
She's my friend.
I kissed him first.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.318
I need him to understand that.

22:00.385 --> 22:04.156
It's hard for me to say this,
cos of everything, but...

22:05.691 --> 22:08.727
...you know that I do have
feelings for you.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.430
I would never upset you.
You upset me.

22:19.571 --> 22:22.941
I don't do meself any favours
with these girls,

22:23.008 --> 22:27.579
but I'm thinking the best place to
sleep is with Sarah and Zahida.

22:27.646 --> 22:30.749
That won't cause any problems
for me and Abbie(!)

22:30.816 --> 22:33.185
Night-night, Scott,
you fucking idiot.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.492
(Aaron) It's tough at the top.
Top shagger.

22:40.559 --> 22:43.729
I'm getting over Marnie.
I'm in a bad way.

22:43.795 --> 22:47.165
She goes from being a caterpillar
into a beautiful butterfly.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.868
Gary is absolutely
shitting himself.

22:49.935 --> 22:52.537
"I've booked you a flight
home in the morning."

22:52.604 --> 22:55.006
I do not want to go back to
Newcastle.

22:56.374 --> 22:59.845
Having every bird want a slice of
you isn't a bad problem.

22:59.911 --> 23:03.448
Who wants to get fucked
for the last night? (all cheer)

23:03.515 --> 23:05.317
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:07.486 --> 23:07.686
.

23:10.188 --> 23:10.388
.

23:21.633 --> 23:22.868
Uh-huh.

23:30.408 --> 23:34.012
I wake up and if last night
wasn't shit enough,

23:34.079 --> 23:38.216
Scott is laid next to Sarah.
What the fuck?

23:38.283 --> 23:39.451
Morning, Princess.

23:40.652 --> 23:42.254
Morning, Princess.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.490
I've woke up this morning,
and Scott's in bed with us.

23:45.557 --> 23:48.460
I remember we had a good chat
last night.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.262
He's being honest with us.

23:50.328 --> 23:53.999
He said he'll end things with Abbie,
which is the right thing to do.

23:57.135 --> 24:01.006
We were out here a few days
before Marnie came here.

24:01.072 --> 24:03.408
Aaron didn't pull. Marnie's arrived,

24:03.475 --> 24:05.811
and all of sudden,
he's bringing girls back.

24:05.877 --> 24:10.048
He wants a reaction from her. He
does. He'll never get one, though.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.884
Aaron didn't pull any girls
before Marnie got here,

24:12.951 --> 24:17.823
now that she's here, he's only
pulling girls to make her jealous.

24:17.889 --> 24:21.092
I don't care, as long as he's
happy, let him do his thing.

24:21.159 --> 24:23.695
The other boys were saying
you were bothered.

24:23.762 --> 24:24.863
Who, me?

24:24.930 --> 24:28.200
Yeah. The second that girl
came in, you danced on Sam.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.503
I don't care that Aaron pulled.
What makes it awkward

24:31.570 --> 24:33.505
is that everyone acts differently.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.774
I don't care.
Why does everyone else?

24:35.841 --> 24:37.576
They make it awkward.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.545
If they think I'm bothered,
let them think it.

24:40.612 --> 24:42.814
The thing I know is I'm not.

24:45.550 --> 24:48.186
It's tough at the top, Gaz.
Top shagger.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.488
(both laugh)

24:50.555 --> 24:54.359
Gaz is as happy as me that
I've christened the Shag Pad.

24:54.426 --> 24:58.230
I'm getting over Marnie.
His pep talk done the trick.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.699
Howdy.
Morning, boys.

25:00.765 --> 25:01.867
What's up, son?

25:01.933 --> 25:04.202
Oh! Get your arm off
the top shagger's bed.

25:04.269 --> 25:06.404
You can't touch
the top shagger's bed.

25:06.471 --> 25:09.774
Aaron reckons he's top shagger
cos he's had a one-night stand.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.577
He's forgetting that
it's a one-night stand.

25:12.644 --> 25:16.214
It doesn't excuse
the past six years.

25:16.281 --> 25:19.251
Where are you in life?
Me head's boggled.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.086
Basically, like, so I...

25:21.152 --> 25:23.622
I ended up chatting all night
to Sarah.

25:23.688 --> 25:26.491
Stay in Sarah's bed?
I smoothed things over with her.

25:26.558 --> 25:29.427
Abbie's going to be feeling great
about that(!)

25:29.494 --> 25:33.298
I don't know why I get stressed out
over Sarah and Abbie.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.600
If I look at the problem,

25:35.667 --> 25:39.337
having every bird want a slice of
you isn't a bad problem.

25:39.404 --> 25:40.605
It's fucking wicked!

25:44.276 --> 25:45.543
(laughs)
Bloody hell.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.346
I've woke up to walk downstairs

25:48.413 --> 25:50.882
to see Abbie with a face
like a smacked arse.

25:50.949 --> 25:54.853
Scott didn't stay in my room.
No, he slept downstairs.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.888
Who with?
With Sarah and Zahida...

25:56.955 --> 25:59.057
Shut the fuck up!
Yeah.

25:59.124 --> 26:00.125
Sarah?

26:00.191 --> 26:02.560
I'm not really bothered,
I'll be honest.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.763
I'm telling Marty I'm not bothered,

26:04.829 --> 26:07.198
but really,
I'm actually devastated.

26:07.265 --> 26:12.103
The one lad that I started to
get close to has mugged us off.

26:12.170 --> 26:14.239
You need to speak to him.

26:14.306 --> 26:18.009
I did speak to Sarah,
I did say sorry about the situation.

26:18.076 --> 26:23.014
But too much has happened for it
to be the way it was before.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.082
Yeah.

26:24.149 --> 26:27.585
Whatever's happened,
I feel even more betrayed.

26:27.652 --> 26:31.790
Now, I don't know whether I want
a friendship with Sarah at all.

26:36.227 --> 26:37.429
Fuck off!

26:38.797 --> 26:40.065
Come on, girls!

26:40.131 --> 26:42.067
(Nathan) I'm a boy.
And boys.

26:42.133 --> 26:44.803
I'm taking the girls and Nathan
ice skating.

26:44.869 --> 26:47.439
I used to be
a national champion skater.

26:47.505 --> 26:50.642
I wasn't really national,
but I did win Bradford once.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.943
(Nathan) Go!

26:57.415 --> 26:59.117
Ooh, shit. Sorry.
Right.

26:59.184 --> 27:01.486
I've heard Chloe is
a belter ice skater.

27:01.553 --> 27:03.855
I won't believe it till I see it.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.423
Have you seen the lass?

27:05.490 --> 27:08.059
Even when she's sober
she can't walk straight,

27:08.126 --> 27:09.427
let alone ice skate.

27:09.494 --> 27:13.198
Are these the basic bitches one?
Yeah. And I'm the main bitch.

27:13.264 --> 27:16.301
I'm fat. I'll go through the ice.
You'll be fine.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.003
Youse all ready?
(all) Yes.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.171
Come on, then!
(all cheer)

27:24.075 --> 27:27.612
We pull up to the slope,
everyone's raring to go,

27:27.679 --> 27:29.280
Marty's being sick.

27:29.347 --> 27:31.783
(retches)
He's spewing.

27:31.850 --> 27:34.386
Fuck me, I'm not feeling meself.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.988
Oh, boy.

27:37.989 --> 27:39.157
(exhales)

27:39.224 --> 27:40.692
I'm in a bad way.

27:40.759 --> 27:43.261
Ooh, I see pasta, mate.

27:43.328 --> 27:47.532
Marty, go tuck yourself into bed
and have a nice day off.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.402
(laughter)

27:53.671 --> 27:57.942
Next on the ice rink, from Newcastle,
it's Chloe!

27:58.009 --> 27:59.511
Yay!
(girls cheer)

28:04.949 --> 28:06.985
Oh, I love that one.
Yeah. More!

28:10.321 --> 28:15.560
Wow. I have never seen something
so beautiful in all my life.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.163
I didn't realise Chloe
was this good.

28:18.229 --> 28:20.231
(cheering)

28:25.470 --> 28:29.307
Today, me and the boys
went right up the fucking top.

28:29.374 --> 28:33.912
There's only one way down,
on your board or on your arse.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.816
(Scotty T) There he is.
Why are we stopped?

28:37.882 --> 28:41.219
Waiting for this divvy.
Yeah, look at this. Neat.

28:41.286 --> 28:44.823
We went up the slopes and come
across this ski, snowboard

28:44.889 --> 28:49.160
big ramp bungee thing.
It would be rude not to try it.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.997
(Aaron) Is he attached to
just that rope? Can't be.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.599
I'm buzzing.

28:54.666 --> 28:57.368
There's no better way
to soothe your mind

28:57.435 --> 28:59.537
than to hoy yourself off a cliff.

28:59.604 --> 29:04.542
(Gaz) Fucking hell. Enjoy, kid.
(Aaron) Best of luck, mate.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.611
(Gaz) Yay, you nutter!

29:09.414 --> 29:11.783
(laughing)
Oh!

29:13.284 --> 29:17.222
Scott goes first, flies down,
goes and pops a back flip.

29:17.288 --> 29:20.358
Shit, I'm second.
I can't let him beat us.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.559
Fucking hell.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.828
Oh, my God. What am I doing here?

29:23.895 --> 29:26.097
Gary is absolutely
shitting himself.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.766
His legs are shaking
like a shitting dog's.

29:31.136 --> 29:33.304
(whoops) YES!

29:33.371 --> 29:37.308
I'm not letting the lads call me
a chicken! Here we fucking go.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.814
(laughs)
Fucking hell!

29:42.881 --> 29:44.182
Whoa!

29:44.249 --> 29:46.017
Right. It's my time to shine.

29:46.084 --> 29:49.187
I've got me technique
in the head.

29:49.254 --> 29:51.156
Pull off a perfect double back flip.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.396
Whoa! Yay! Yay!

29:58.463 --> 30:00.298
Tekkers.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.834
Oh! Wow.

30:04.602 --> 30:07.438
(Sophie) Look at Chloe.
Look how mint she is.

30:07.505 --> 30:10.175
(Nathan) Now,
Chloe is showing off.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.510
She won't let anybody on the ice.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.016
I can't get over
how amazing Chloe is.

30:18.082 --> 30:21.286
She goes from a caterpillar
into a beautiful butterfly.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.488
How the fuck does she do it?

30:25.223 --> 30:27.525
My God, it's really pretty.
Isn't it?

30:28.526 --> 30:29.928
(Nathan) Ta-da!

30:29.994 --> 30:34.265
Chloe is amazing. How can someone
be that clumsy in real life,

30:34.332 --> 30:36.234
but like THAT on the ice?

30:38.036 --> 30:40.772
Yay!
(girls cheer)

30:45.343 --> 30:47.745
That bungee was fucking amazing.

30:47.812 --> 30:50.815
But we need to
get back to the chalet.

30:59.991 --> 31:01.125
Oh, shit.

31:01.192 --> 31:03.127
(mobile phone rings)
Phone!

31:03.194 --> 31:04.629
Oh, no!

31:05.597 --> 31:09.267
Why is this bitch ringing us,
day in, day out?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.970
Do you not have
a proper fucking job?

31:12.036 --> 31:14.439
Hi, Anna. You all right?
"Hello. How are you?"

31:14.505 --> 31:17.642
"Have you had a good day?"
It's been pure cush.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.345
"I've booked you a flight home
in the morning."

31:20.411 --> 31:23.047
Right. OK, so we're going home
tomorrow morning.

31:23.114 --> 31:25.183
(Gaz) No!
I ain't gonna lie.

31:25.250 --> 31:30.054
I do not want to go back. I want
to stay and I want to snowboard.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.825
"Chloe, do not miss the flight."
I would never miss it for you.

31:33.891 --> 31:36.160
Back to the toon!
"Tell the others."

31:36.227 --> 31:37.362
OK. Bye.

31:37.428 --> 31:41.499
I wonder if Anna has made a
decision on the newbies yet.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.301
It'll be awful to say goodbye,

31:43.368 --> 31:45.703
all of them
are part of the family.

31:55.213 --> 31:57.815
We're heading home tomorrow,
but it won't stop us

31:57.882 --> 32:00.918
having a wicked night.
Let's go out with a fucking bang.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.855
Scott, it's tough at the top.
Aaron.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.089
(all laugh)

32:05.156 --> 32:07.892
When we get out of here...
Fucking hates it.

32:07.959 --> 32:10.461
If I wanted to go on the pull,

32:10.528 --> 32:12.530
I could have done it every night.

32:12.597 --> 32:16.100
It's more fun to graft
every newbie in the house.

32:16.167 --> 32:19.237
I won fucking two. In fact, I
might even have fucking three.

32:19.304 --> 32:21.939
I want to bang Zahida.
(laughs)

32:22.006 --> 32:24.942
Or put on Zahida...
But it's the last night.

32:25.009 --> 32:26.978
Yes! (whispers) Zahida.
(laughs)

32:27.045 --> 32:28.846
No harm having fun with newbies.

32:28.913 --> 32:32.884
They all want a slice, there's no
reason I cannot juggle them about,

32:32.950 --> 32:34.919
considering I'm a clown, anyway.

32:34.986 --> 32:36.688
(all cheer)

32:36.754 --> 32:38.289
Oh, he's, he's very fragile.

32:38.356 --> 32:41.859
Marty walks in,
and he looks like fucking shit.

32:41.926 --> 32:44.128
Surely he's not coming out
tonight.

32:44.195 --> 32:46.164
I can't even fucking come... Ah.

32:46.230 --> 32:48.366
You've been in bed all day.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.902
We're a man down,
but it won't affect it.

32:50.968 --> 32:53.137
Cheers to our last night
in Tignes.

32:53.204 --> 32:54.238
Cheers to Scabbie.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.373
(all laugh)

32:55.440 --> 32:57.342
It's Scarah now.

32:57.408 --> 32:58.810
(all laugh)

33:01.646 --> 33:05.283
I'm hoping that we're going to
have a drama-free night.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.719
But it never fucking happens.
No.

33:07.785 --> 33:09.454
Hello.
Hiya.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.923
Hi.
Youse all right? Yeah.

33:11.989 --> 33:15.360
I walk into our room and Sarah
and Zahida are sat there.

33:15.426 --> 33:18.529
I want to have a sober
conversation and sort things out.

33:18.596 --> 33:21.265
I just don't want any arguments,
I don't.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.267
I want us to have a good night.

33:23.334 --> 33:27.038
I want to get across to Sarah
that I'll stay away from Scott

33:27.105 --> 33:29.173
so we can all have a good night.

33:29.240 --> 33:33.144
It's a very fucked-up situation.
We're literally in a triangle.

33:33.211 --> 33:36.180
I do think
it's very convenient timing

33:36.247 --> 33:39.317
that Abbie wants to hang out
with the girls tonight

33:39.384 --> 33:41.819
after Scott stayed in my bed
last night.

33:41.886 --> 33:44.956
At least she's starting to
back off from Scott.

33:52.029 --> 33:53.765
(Nathan) Hello, hello, hello!

33:53.831 --> 33:55.199
Oy, oy, charver.

33:55.266 --> 33:59.904
It's our last night in Tignes.
My main priority is getting mortal.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.773
I'll bury the hatchet with Abbie,

34:01.839 --> 34:04.575
but I'm not promising
I'll stay away from Scott.

34:04.642 --> 34:08.846
Who wants to get fucked
for the last night? (all cheer)

34:08.913 --> 34:10.447
Cheers!
(all cheer)

34:13.351 --> 34:15.485
Scott's saying
he's willing to pie Abbie

34:15.553 --> 34:17.088
if I say we'll get together.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.259
Aaron's ruined it all
by slapping me with his meat.

34:21.324 --> 34:22.460
Oy!

34:22.527 --> 34:25.563
Scott and Zahida have just kissed
next to the cooker.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.965
(glass shatters)
It was an innocent peck.

34:28.032 --> 34:29.400
Sarah?
What?

34:29.467 --> 34:33.237
I'm going home.
(crying) God. This is so hard.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.873
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:38.943 --> 34:39.143
.

34:41.679 --> 34:41.879
.

34:50.353 --> 34:53.925
We're off to the bar
and Scotty T is pure on one.

34:53.991 --> 34:58.096
I've got so much love to spread,
I'll take on an extra newbie,

34:58.162 --> 34:59.764
to share the fucking joy.

35:04.168 --> 35:07.038
Last night. Let's have a good one.
Cheers, everyone!

35:07.104 --> 35:08.506
(all cheer)

35:12.276 --> 35:15.079
We get to the club,
me and Sarah are on better terms.

35:15.146 --> 35:18.616
It's our last night in Tignes.
I want all of us to have fun.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.455
It's fun getting mortal
with these newbies,

35:24.522 --> 35:28.192
but I am missing me drinking buddy,
Marty. I wish he was here tonight.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.904
Scott's asking us
if I still like him.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.274
I think he's trying
to get us back. I knew it.

35:49.680 --> 35:52.683
I can see Sarah and Scott
having a conversation.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.720
She seems very into him.
It's annoying us.

35:55.786 --> 35:59.457
I was going to stay away
for the sake of no drama,

35:59.524 --> 36:02.894
now she swooped herself in
and gone straight in there.

36:05.630 --> 36:06.631
Right.

36:12.069 --> 36:14.739
Scott's saying that
he's willing to pie Abbie

36:14.805 --> 36:19.810
if I say we'll get together. I
don't know if he's being serious.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.115
AH!

36:25.716 --> 36:28.920
I'm not hanging around on the
off-chance you might pie us.

36:28.986 --> 36:31.722
There's one newbie
who's yet to come face to face

36:31.789 --> 36:33.524
with the Abominable Snow Dick.

36:47.371 --> 36:49.307
I'm talking to Gary about Aaron.

36:49.373 --> 36:53.411
Even though he pulled a random bird,
he's got feelings for Marnie.

37:01.953 --> 37:07.425
Aaron's always wanted to pull.
I'm his best friend, I know that.

37:07.491 --> 37:10.828
The reason he doesn't pull,
cos Marnie cock blocks him.

37:10.895 --> 37:14.298
Aaron's scared to pull.
He's scared of pissing off Marnie.

37:14.365 --> 37:15.800
I've got him over that.

37:26.844 --> 37:30.348
Marnie and Aaron have got
this crazy relationship,

37:30.414 --> 37:33.784
but what I know is, no matter
how many randoms he pulls,

37:33.851 --> 37:36.721
they'll never live up to Marnie.
That's the problem.

37:45.296 --> 37:46.998
I'm sitting, chatting to Scott.

37:47.064 --> 37:50.134
He should make a decision
between Sarah and Abbie,

37:50.201 --> 37:52.303
put them out of their misery.

37:59.243 --> 38:01.746
This kid likes to keep
his options open.

38:01.812 --> 38:03.981
Abbie and Sarah are
eating out of my hand.

38:04.048 --> 38:07.718
If you're interested,
there's plenty more to chew on.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.688
I'm talking to Scott,
but all I can see

38:10.755 --> 38:13.658
is that cheeky grin.
I think he's flirting with us.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.726
No chance. I've got a boyfriend.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.962
(Chloe) Howay, Scott!

38:18.029 --> 38:19.797
I thought Scott was joking

38:19.864 --> 38:22.366
when he said he was gonna
try it on with Zahida.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.769
It actually looks like
he's going to do it.

38:24.835 --> 38:27.071
That kid has got
some fucking balls.

38:32.643 --> 38:35.279
Youse! Let's go home!

38:35.346 --> 38:36.447
Whoo-hooo!

38:36.514 --> 38:37.815
We're all leaving,

38:37.882 --> 38:41.285
and I notice that Scott is
hanging back with Zahida.

38:41.352 --> 38:45.122
He still hasn't spoken to Abbie.
I don't understand.

38:45.189 --> 38:46.724
Is he avoiding me as well?

38:48.359 --> 38:49.360
(laughter)

38:50.695 --> 38:51.929
Aaah.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.464
(speaking indistinctly)

38:53.531 --> 38:58.269
Scott's like me brother.
He is definitely up to something.

39:00.571 --> 39:02.440
I'm not fucking eating cheese!

39:02.506 --> 39:04.909
Get back to the house
and I'm Hank Marvin.

39:04.975 --> 39:08.345
Let's hope that there's some
decent scran for me to munch.

39:08.412 --> 39:12.049
Cheers to a good night!
(laughs)

39:14.685 --> 39:16.287
We've had a wicked night,

39:16.353 --> 39:19.857
but Aaron's ruined it
by slapping me with his meat.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.492
Who wants some cheese?

39:21.559 --> 39:23.027
Yes, me, please!

39:23.094 --> 39:24.261
Me. No!

39:24.328 --> 39:25.629
(laughter)

39:25.696 --> 39:30.101
I stink of cheese and meat,
so I'm going in the shower,

39:30.167 --> 39:32.670
cos this smells awful.

39:43.848 --> 39:45.816
I'm sitting, minding my business.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.019
I can't help but notice
Scott and Zahida getting close.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.589
This could go very, very wrong.

39:51.655 --> 39:55.126
I want... I want The Zad, man.
(laughs)

39:55.192 --> 39:57.762
I thought Scott was
flirting with us in the club,

39:57.828 --> 40:00.331
but now that we're back home,
he's all over us.

40:00.397 --> 40:03.467
I know I shouldn't,
but I like the attention.

40:05.236 --> 40:08.973
Me and Zahida are getting on wicked.
Nowt wrong with giving her a kiss.

40:09.039 --> 40:12.276
She has a lad, but what mans
doesn't know won't hurt him.

40:13.677 --> 40:18.816
Oh! (laughs)
What the fuck have I just seen?

40:18.883 --> 40:21.919
Scott and Zahida have just kissed
next to the cooker.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.821
Scott and Zahida, Zahida, Scott!

40:23.888 --> 40:24.889
(laughing)

40:24.955 --> 40:28.526
Scott's being Scott and he's
give us a peck. Aaron's seen.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.529
He thinks there's something
more to it. There isn't.

40:31.595 --> 40:35.699
Scott and Z are going to shag?
Shag Pad's yours.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.668
How's it turned into that?

40:37.735 --> 40:40.638
If I'm getting this much grief
for kissing a bird,

40:40.704 --> 40:44.341
and cooking nuggets, what'll it be
like when I shag and bake a cake?

40:44.408 --> 40:45.476
It's not funny.

40:47.478 --> 40:50.247
Aaron's taking the piss,
and it's gone too far.

40:50.314 --> 40:52.883
If me boyfriend finds out
Scott kissed us,

40:52.950 --> 40:56.520
it's gonna break his heart. Fuck
this. I'm getting out of here.

40:58.055 --> 40:59.323
Sarah?
What?

40:59.390 --> 41:00.958
I'm going home.
Why?

41:01.025 --> 41:04.094
All of them are saying
I necked on with Scott. I didn't.

41:04.161 --> 41:07.198
I know you didn't, man.
Don't be so ridiculous.

41:07.264 --> 41:10.668
No, it's just not funny.
That's my fucking relationship.

41:10.734 --> 41:13.137
You see us kiss on the cheek?
Sh!

41:13.204 --> 41:15.840
Who upset her that much
that she's crying

41:15.906 --> 41:18.209
saying she wants to go home?
Me.

41:18.275 --> 41:21.779
Fuck off. I might have upset her.
I said they kissed cos it's true.

41:21.846 --> 41:24.481
He's talking shit.
It's not fucking funny.

41:24.548 --> 41:26.650
That was me. I said it.

41:26.717 --> 41:29.887
It looked like Scott and Zahida
kissed on the lips.

41:29.954 --> 41:34.325
(crying) I would never do that.
(speaking indistinctly)

41:34.391 --> 41:38.162
Why would you not give a fuck?
You don't start!

41:38.229 --> 41:40.197
Sarah is pure doing my nut in.

41:40.264 --> 41:43.067
Stop giving us grief,
before I go fucking crackers.

41:43.133 --> 41:44.201
(glass shatters)

41:44.268 --> 41:46.136
What are you doing, Scott?

41:46.203 --> 41:48.639
It's so heated in here
that Scotty decides

41:48.706 --> 41:51.575
we don't need the oven,
and smashes the fuck out of it.

41:51.642 --> 41:56.046
Everyone knows, in this house,
I don't lie. Don't lie.

41:56.113 --> 41:59.016
Scott has just proven to everyone
that it happened.

41:59.083 --> 42:02.286
Why's he kicked off, smashed
the cooker and stormed out?

42:02.353 --> 42:05.422
I know what I saw.
The truth will come out.

42:05.489 --> 42:07.324
In this house, it always does.

42:11.962 --> 42:13.597
This is a fucking nightmare.

42:13.664 --> 42:15.366
It was an innocent little peck

42:15.432 --> 42:16.967
Wait. Sort of innocent.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.603
Still, I cannot wait to
get back to Newcastle.

42:22.106 --> 42:23.707
(sobbing)

42:29.947 --> 42:34.118
I don't know what to believe,
but Zahida is really upset.

42:34.184 --> 42:37.588
I feel like I need to make sure
she has someone to comfort her.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.291
Don't let it get to you.

42:40.357 --> 42:44.228
For the first time ever,
I feel alone.

42:45.930 --> 42:47.965
Oh, God. This is so hard.

43:00.511 --> 43:02.980
After all the drama in Tignes,

43:03.047 --> 43:05.549
we're back in Newcastle
on our home turf.

43:05.616 --> 43:07.484
Haven't been here in a while!

43:07.551 --> 43:09.887
Get ready and get pissed!
(all cheer)

43:09.954 --> 43:13.257
(shouting) That bitch has
tried to get physical with me?

43:13.324 --> 43:15.426
No-one cares about it.

43:15.492 --> 43:19.029
How the hell can I be
Zahida's best friend after this?

43:19.096 --> 43:21.465
I would hate to be
a newbie right now.

43:21.532 --> 43:22.766
(guys exclaim)

43:24.335 --> 43:26.637
Tonight is gonna go fucking off.

43:26.704 --> 43:29.573
(screaming)
I'll have nightmares for weeks!

43:29.640 --> 43:32.009
I'm not a fucking option!
I'm not a one or two!

43:32.076 --> 43:33.077
Fuck off!

43:33.143 --> 43:35.079
What am I supposed to do? Say no?

43:36.647 --> 43:41.051
All I want to do right now is run.
Shit's just got real.

43:41.118 --> 43:44.888
I only want
the three best workers.

43:44.955 --> 43:46.924
Someone is definitely going.

44:13.450 --> 44:13.650
.
