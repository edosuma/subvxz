00:00.080 --> 00:01.768
Previously on "Damien"...

00:01.769 --> 00:05.099
We have a lot to process. You
took a lethal dose of morphine.

00:05.100 --> 00:08.099
It's impossible for a person to
survive that, and yet, here you are.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.389
Your release is predicated
on daily sessions

00:10.390 --> 00:12.019
in order to monitor your progress.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.479
Tell me about Damien Thorn.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.389
You know who you should
talk to? Charles Powell.

00:15.390 --> 00:17.519
Powell thought Thorn
was the Second Coming.

00:17.520 --> 00:21.402
- Charles?
- How the hell are you, Cray?

00:23.600 --> 00:26.274
You should have kept
your bloody mouth shut.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.149
Simone, I got to go.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.479
No matter what happens,
take care of yourself.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.519
Damien, are you okay? Hello?

00:40.600 --> 00:42.389
Know any good bars around here?

00:42.390 --> 00:45.559
Take me to your place. We'll
break in if we have to.

00:45.560 --> 00:47.430
I'm down with that.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.430
I have sought you out for a reason.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.552
Will you help me?

00:55.900 --> 00:59.179
There are seven of them. If
each are placed correctly,

00:59.180 --> 01:03.059
your spirit and life
will cease to exist.

02:38.285 --> 02:40.189
Did you find it?

02:42.045 --> 02:43.746
You scared the crap out of me.

02:44.073 --> 02:45.599
Look at this.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.680
Is that it?

02:50.520 --> 02:53.886
In nomine Patris, et
Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

04:25.343 --> 04:27.431
Let's talk some more about the PTSD.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.137
Is that the official diagnosis?

04:32.018 --> 04:34.355
Your symptoms track with the diagnosis.

04:35.506 --> 04:37.778
Flashbacks, the hallucinations...

04:38.100 --> 04:40.349
insomnia, night sweats... paranoia.

04:40.350 --> 04:42.479
To be honest, I just feel like a dick.

04:43.873 --> 04:46.139
I've seen so many other people suffer.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.679
I've grown up with money.
I have a job I love.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.563
Just feels like whining.

04:51.997 --> 04:54.487
Survivor's guilt is
another part of this.

04:55.478 --> 04:58.476
All of these symptoms are
manageable with proper medication.

04:58.970 --> 05:01.743
Yeah? What about the Antichrist
thing? You got a pill for that?

05:05.016 --> 05:06.615
How do you plan on managing that?

05:08.521 --> 05:10.579
Question is, how do you
plan on managing that?

05:12.444 --> 05:15.483
For the sake of argument, let's
put the PTSD diagnosis aside...

05:16.440 --> 05:17.825
and examine this.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.429
Let's just say you're meant
to be the Antichrist.

05:23.847 --> 05:25.700
What exactly does that mean to you?

05:33.205 --> 05:35.271
It means I'm gonna do horrible things...

05:37.250 --> 05:42.165
Be responsible for... pain
and chaos and destruction.

05:44.986 --> 05:47.900
- Would that make you feel fulfilled?
- Of course not.

05:47.901 --> 05:51.599
- Then don't do it.
- I don't have a choice.

05:52.222 --> 05:53.898
Everyone has a choice.

05:56.798 --> 05:59.192
Sartre says we are our choices,

05:59.600 --> 06:03.350
that even failing to
choose is still a choice.

06:04.820 --> 06:08.819
You picked up "Nausea" before. Was
that an accident or a choice?

06:09.365 --> 06:12.782
So this is just good, old-fashioned,
existential crisis, is that it?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.708
Some people find choice to be a burden.

06:18.820 --> 06:21.511
They want their path to
be laid out for them.

06:23.353 --> 06:27.014
Personal responsibility...
It's a blessing and a curse.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.569
It leaves us with no one
to blame but ourselves.

06:31.736 --> 06:34.271
Truth is, you have already
been making choices.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.480
Can we agree that those choices have
not been working for you so far?

06:48.480 --> 06:49.979
I spoke to the vic earlier that day.

06:49.980 --> 06:53.899
I was running some leads on,
uh, Damien Thorn's case.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.019
I also spoke to a Charles Powell.

06:56.020 --> 06:57.569
The two of them went
to school with Thorn.

06:57.570 --> 06:59.399
We have video of Powell
following Marquand

06:59.400 --> 07:01.069
into the club.

07:01.070 --> 07:03.399
Seems he, uh, was going
after him for some reason.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.069
'Cause you tipped him off.

07:05.070 --> 07:07.069
Powell's in the wind.
He runs a flower shop.

07:07.070 --> 07:09.019
We've got a unit sitting
on it right now.

07:09.020 --> 07:10.569
Mess.

07:10.570 --> 07:12.399
Powell cut out his tongue?

07:13.044 --> 07:14.623
Yeah. I think he took it as a souvenir.

07:14.624 --> 07:17.979
So you're telling me your guy Thorn
didn't kill this one, either?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.939
Find Powell.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.940
Wrap this shit up.

09:50.572 --> 09:52.611
You should lock your door. There's a
bad element in this neighborhood.

09:52.612 --> 09:54.070
You can't just come in here.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.779
I won't take long.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.218
Whatever you need, I can't help you.
I've been pretty busy lately, so...

10:20.429 --> 10:22.138
I didn't know people still used film.

10:22.139 --> 10:23.719
Thought all that stuff was digital now.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.473
It's an old roll. I just found it.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.270
I hear you had a trip to
the hospital last week.

10:40.939 --> 10:42.637
Well, I'm fine now. Thanks for asking.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.244
What was that?

10:45.200 --> 10:48.029
Patient confidentiality. They
wouldn't tell me anything.

10:48.030 --> 10:49.619
It was personal.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.200
Speaking of personal...

10:52.659 --> 10:54.666
Ran into an old buddy of
yours the other night.

10:57.552 --> 10:59.159
Is that Cray Marquand?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.200
Somebody cut out his tongue.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.635
You don't think I did this, do you?

11:12.545 --> 11:13.949
People drop dead around you,

11:13.950 --> 11:16.159
and you... you just never get
any blood on your hands.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.910
I was in the hospital.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.425
Anyone bring you flowers?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.119
What?

11:25.120 --> 11:26.989
Charles Powell.

11:27.441 --> 11:29.368
He's a florist in New York.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.870
Right?

11:34.172 --> 11:36.671
I wouldn't know. I haven't
talked to him since school.

11:36.672 --> 11:38.593
Powell's missing.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.619
What does that have to do with me?

11:41.620 --> 11:43.869
Why'd you try to kill yourself?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.740
Got a guilty conscience?

11:48.660 --> 11:51.740
Friendships from the past
coming back here to haunt you?

11:57.370 --> 11:58.740
Mm.

12:04.662 --> 12:07.161
If Powell tries to contact you,

12:07.162 --> 12:10.993
you call me... Immediately.

12:12.370 --> 12:14.221
You can keep those.

12:15.531 --> 12:17.240
Add them to your collection.

12:56.085 --> 12:57.639
Appreciate this, by the way.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.389
You're lucky our cameras have an
angle on your friend's apartment.

13:00.390 --> 13:03.059
Yeah, if I can just see the guy
who broke into his apartment.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.309
What'd he take?

13:04.310 --> 13:05.849
I don't know, man.

13:05.850 --> 13:09.059
I was just, uh, told
the place got trashed.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.559
Yeah?

13:10.560 --> 13:12.559
Your friend must have
pissed someone off.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.930
Yeah. Seems like it.

13:16.350 --> 13:17.776
Whoa. Hold that?

13:19.290 --> 13:20.480
Can you zoom in on her?

13:25.376 --> 13:27.100
What, you know her?

13:30.430 --> 13:31.930
Yeah.

13:34.890 --> 13:39.094
- Here you go.
- Uh... enjoy the game.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.560
Yeah. Thanks.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.479
Ms. Rutledge.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.325
What can I do for you today?

14:10.600 --> 14:13.188
- I need a favor.
- Of course.

14:23.640 --> 14:25.890
I need you to destroy this.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.224
Unusual details.

14:33.100 --> 14:34.929
Family heirloom?

14:35.914 --> 14:37.480
Not my family.

14:38.810 --> 14:40.930
Anything for you.

15:45.456 --> 15:46.876
I'm sorry, ma'am.

15:48.313 --> 15:49.953
I've never seen anything like it.

15:58.072 --> 15:59.451
You should've called me sooner.

15:59.452 --> 16:01.072
How do you know we can trust her?

16:01.073 --> 16:02.338
She's a nun.

16:02.339 --> 16:04.519
The Vatican sent her here to
investigate what's going on.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.390
I think she can make sense of things.

16:15.310 --> 16:18.479
Do you know who this woman is?

16:18.480 --> 16:21.519
No. Damien first saw her in Damascus.

16:21.520 --> 16:22.929
It really rattled him.

16:22.930 --> 16:26.309
And then we got back and...

16:26.310 --> 16:27.349
Kelly...

16:27.350 --> 16:28.236
Yeah.

16:29.469 --> 16:32.889
And then this woman shows
up... Ann Rutledge.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.389
She came out of nowhere.

16:34.390 --> 16:36.429
Says she's been with him
since he was a kid.

16:36.430 --> 16:39.639
Has a shrine of all his stuff,
like some kind of crazed stalker.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.519
Ann Rutledge of Armitage?

16:41.520 --> 16:45.073
Yeah, he's convinced that she's the
head of the same conspiracy around him.

16:45.074 --> 16:46.679
She's claiming that
she's been his guardian

16:46.680 --> 16:48.389
since the White House.

16:48.390 --> 16:50.613
So she really could be his benefactor.

16:51.390 --> 16:53.898
The Vatican was expecting a man.

16:55.146 --> 16:57.979
We assumed there was someone
looking out for him

16:57.980 --> 17:00.059
the past 25 years.

17:00.060 --> 17:04.059
Rutledge could be the person
we've been looking for.

17:04.060 --> 17:07.560
Simone says you think there's
another person involved?

17:10.680 --> 17:12.979
Yeah. Uh, her name's Veronica.

17:12.980 --> 17:15.309
She works at the Collodion Collective.

17:15.310 --> 17:19.059
I saw security footage of her
going into Damien's place.

17:19.060 --> 17:21.390
What's her job for the Collective?

17:26.390 --> 17:27.809
I don't know.

17:27.810 --> 17:30.310
What do you mean? And then
how did you know her?

17:31.560 --> 17:34.309
We're, uh... we're sleeping together.

17:34.310 --> 17:35.559
Oh.

17:35.560 --> 17:38.059
Does she know you saw
this footage of her?

17:38.060 --> 17:39.849
No.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.059
You have to go back to her...

17:42.060 --> 17:45.059
Find out who she's working for.

17:45.060 --> 17:47.849
Yeah, fine. I'll do whatever.

17:47.850 --> 17:50.060
Just stop this craziness.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.809
Damn it!

19:40.303 --> 19:42.173
Ah, you're kidding me.

21:37.580 --> 21:39.460
I knew you'd come.

21:51.830 --> 21:53.829
Did you like my gift?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.879
We used to cut classes
and come here, you know?

22:00.880 --> 22:03.709
- No one would know where we were...
- You killed Cray. Why?

22:03.710 --> 22:07.499
- Why would you do something like that?
- He spoke to that detective about you.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.579
About us.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.709
And I got your messages.

22:12.209 --> 22:14.038
What are you talking about?

22:14.039 --> 22:16.075
From that detective.

22:17.380 --> 22:20.250
He told me all about
those people you killed.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.022
- I didn't kill anyone, Charles.
- You don't have to lie to me.

22:25.620 --> 22:29.079
In school, we were...
We were always honest.

22:29.080 --> 22:31.348
- We were such good friends.
- Yeah, we were.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.559
I bought you your first good camera.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.849
Who'd have thought you'd go this far?

22:35.850 --> 22:36.849
Me.

22:38.859 --> 22:42.070
I told everybody. I-I
always believed in you.

22:44.070 --> 22:46.069
Even after you set me on fire.

22:46.070 --> 22:49.689
That was an accident... A
stupid prank gone wrong.

22:49.690 --> 22:52.438
I didn't choose to put
that fluid on my hands.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.783
You forced me.

22:56.150 --> 22:57.899
The others were taunting.
I turned to you for help,

22:57.900 --> 22:58.979
but you just went along with it.

22:58.980 --> 23:00.502
I was 15.

23:01.230 --> 23:03.019
I'm sorry.

23:03.020 --> 23:06.144
That's what I thought.
You didn't mean it.

23:07.336 --> 23:08.890
But you never came to visit.

23:09.610 --> 23:12.149
And I lay in that hospital
bed for months, and you...

23:12.726 --> 23:14.293
I never heard from you.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.320
I heard you left the school.

23:19.650 --> 23:20.995
Why did you do it?

23:22.230 --> 23:23.440
What was it?

23:24.230 --> 23:26.261
I needed you to stick up for me.

23:26.989 --> 23:29.819
The others would have listened to you.
The others were scared of you.

23:29.820 --> 23:32.987
But you treated me like I was
just some little piece of...

23:32.988 --> 23:34.358
You kept pushing me!

23:34.359 --> 23:36.279
Always following me around,
never leaving me alone.

23:36.280 --> 23:38.019
I warned you you would get hurt.

23:38.020 --> 23:39.550
I told you to stop.

23:39.551 --> 23:42.437
Because we're connected... Bonded.

23:43.230 --> 23:45.179
And that's why I killed Cray...

23:45.917 --> 23:47.649
For you.

23:47.650 --> 23:50.859
No, no, no. That...
That's on you, not me.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.894
- I never asked for that.
- Of course you did.

23:54.980 --> 23:56.980
Just like you did all the others.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.270
What others?

24:05.802 --> 24:07.392
What others, Charles?

24:09.733 --> 24:11.089
Nobodies.

24:11.933 --> 24:14.104
No one even knows they're missing.

24:17.639 --> 24:19.762
I did it all for you.

24:25.350 --> 24:26.938
So...

24:28.073 --> 24:29.597
who should we kill next?

25:04.680 --> 25:06.020
Aah!

25:52.020 --> 25:53.150
James?

25:55.980 --> 25:57.400
You're home.

25:58.520 --> 25:59.689
Yeah.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.609
I decided to call it a day.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.689
You okay? You don't look good.

26:03.690 --> 26:05.019
Did something happen?

26:05.953 --> 26:07.020
I-I'm fine.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.100
Whatcha drawing there?

26:20.430 --> 26:21.599
Why would you draw something like this?

26:21.600 --> 26:22.779
What made you think of a fire?

26:22.780 --> 26:24.690
Jacob, honey, go brush your teeth.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.609
You were scaring him.

26:33.610 --> 26:35.479
What... What is going on?

26:37.556 --> 26:38.642
I don't know.

26:38.643 --> 26:40.939
T-There's something not right with
him ever since the pool incident.

26:40.940 --> 26:42.283
Not right with him?

26:42.742 --> 26:43.855
What is that supposed to mean?

26:43.856 --> 26:45.698
How are your appointments
with Dr. Gellman?

26:46.690 --> 26:48.689
- Fine.
- Really?

26:48.690 --> 26:50.939
I ran into his old secretary
at the post office.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.150
He retired three months
ago and moved to Florida.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.479
Okay, look...

26:59.070 --> 27:00.820
I've been slammed with work.

27:02.610 --> 27:04.241
Are you kidding me?

27:05.020 --> 27:06.779
This can't wait.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.939
Do not walk out on me right now.

27:08.940 --> 27:10.650
We need to talk about this.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.650
Put your hands behind your back... now.

28:46.435 --> 28:48.194
I knew he'd never kill me.

28:49.070 --> 28:50.979
I'm the only one who understands him.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.848
Who did this?!

28:53.849 --> 28:55.730
The devil.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.979
The devil did this.

29:04.879 --> 29:06.385
I almost killed someone tonight.

29:07.820 --> 29:08.950
Why didn't you?

29:10.280 --> 29:12.659
I-I stopped myself. I made that choice.

29:12.660 --> 29:14.660
I-I didn't want to be that person.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.989
Who is this person you almost killed?

29:17.990 --> 29:20.779
This... This...

29:20.780 --> 29:23.279
This sick freak named Charles Powell.

29:23.280 --> 29:25.279
He's... He's been killing
people in my name.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.449
He got it into his head
that I wanted him to.

29:27.450 --> 29:28.989
Where is he now?

29:28.990 --> 29:30.319
I assume jail.

29:30.320 --> 29:32.779
I mean, if... if anyone
deserves to die, it's him.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.739
He's been killing people... For me.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.029
And... And I... Tonight, I could j...

29:36.030 --> 29:38.369
I could just feel what it would be like

29:38.370 --> 29:40.279
just... just to wipe him
out of existence...

29:40.280 --> 29:43.079
To take this one bit
of evil in the world.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.409
Wouldn't that make...

29:44.410 --> 29:46.239
Wouldn't that make the
world a better place?

29:46.240 --> 29:49.029
Just to have him gone!

29:49.030 --> 29:51.739
You know, is... is... Is
that not our responsibility?

29:51.740 --> 29:53.449
You know, when we...
When we encounter evil,

29:53.450 --> 29:55.199
shouldn't we destroy it?

29:56.280 --> 29:58.123
Is that your call to make?

30:00.950 --> 30:03.819
No. No, I'm not... I'm not a
murderer. I never will be.

30:03.820 --> 30:05.361
But how do I know...

30:05.362 --> 30:06.779
how do I know I made the right choice?

30:06.780 --> 30:09.790
How do I know that it
wasn't the evil part of me

30:09.791 --> 30:10.869
that let this monster live?

30:10.870 --> 30:12.319
- You said I get to choose, right?
- Yeah.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.779
All right, so how do I know

30:13.780 --> 30:15.319
when it's... When it's
the good side of me

30:15.320 --> 30:17.990
or... or the evil side
that's doing the choosing?

30:20.820 --> 30:22.760
The fact that you are struggling

30:23.164 --> 30:24.637
means you're human.

30:25.997 --> 30:28.127
You fear the devil inside, but...

30:29.080 --> 30:31.409
you letting Charles Powell live...

30:32.818 --> 30:35.950
That's proof that you've
still got the upper hand.

30:48.360 --> 30:49.660
Hey.

30:52.030 --> 30:53.706
Come here. What's wrong?

30:54.910 --> 30:57.279
Remember when we, uh, broke into
my apartment the other night?

30:58.602 --> 31:00.369
You break into a lot
of places, don't you?

31:00.370 --> 31:01.579
No, sir.

31:01.580 --> 31:03.279
Mama raised me to be

31:03.280 --> 31:05.620
a "one break-in at a time" kind of girl.

31:09.604 --> 31:11.249
How is your mother, by the way?

31:11.744 --> 31:13.126
I'd like to meet her.

31:14.210 --> 31:16.670
It'd be quite an honor
meeting Ann Rutledge.

31:20.380 --> 31:22.419
Listen to me, Amani.
It's not what you think.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.209
You used me to get to my friend.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.749
What do you want with him?

31:26.750 --> 31:28.275
It's not me. It's my mother.

31:28.276 --> 31:29.444
Stay the hell away from him.

31:29.445 --> 31:30.499
I haven't gone near him.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.249
You were in his place.

31:32.250 --> 31:33.879
I was trying to fix it.

31:33.880 --> 31:34.972
Fix what?

31:34.973 --> 31:37.419
My mom had them trash his place. Okay?

31:37.420 --> 31:38.919
She was pissed he was driving her away,

31:38.920 --> 31:40.749
and she wanted him to think
someone was after him

31:40.750 --> 31:42.329
so she could swoop in to protect him.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.087
She's both the arsonist and the fireman.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.919
After she heard he
tried to kill himself,

31:46.920 --> 31:48.541
she had me clean it up.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.419
Look, I don't know what you people want,

31:53.420 --> 31:54.619
but I'm warning you...

31:54.620 --> 31:55.984
If you touch him,

31:55.985 --> 31:57.619
I will kill you.

31:58.294 --> 31:59.381
You have to believe me.

31:59.826 --> 32:00.752
Okay?

32:01.500 --> 32:03.459
Yes, I was supposed to run surveillance,

32:03.460 --> 32:05.379
but this... us... It's real.

32:05.380 --> 32:06.959
You've been lying to me
from the second we met.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.701
I'm not playing you, Amani.

32:08.702 --> 32:09.673
I'm not.

32:10.952 --> 32:12.920
I was, but I am not now.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.979
Listen.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.471
Why don't you go back to your mother...

32:31.170 --> 32:34.311
and Lyons and this nun
and whoever else...

32:35.380 --> 32:36.946
and you tell them this is over.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.716
You understand me?

32:40.420 --> 32:41.391
It's over.

33:04.923 --> 33:06.960
Amani Golkar knows I'm your daughter.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.043
Then Damien knows, too.

33:13.330 --> 33:15.670
One step forward, two steps back.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.249
Well, on our list of problems,
that's pretty far down.

33:20.250 --> 33:23.500
He... also mentioned a nun.

33:26.213 --> 33:27.747
He didn't say more.

33:31.207 --> 33:32.920
Find out who she is.

33:35.593 --> 33:37.670
And no more carelessness.

33:54.072 --> 33:55.981
Armitage is a huge corporation.

33:55.982 --> 33:57.919
Didn't the Vatican think
that the Antichrist

33:57.920 --> 34:00.379
would be backed or supported
by something like that?

34:00.380 --> 34:01.709
How could they miss that?

34:01.710 --> 34:03.249
Hubris.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.879
The Vatican has watched
nations rise and fall

34:05.880 --> 34:07.289
from its ivory towers.

34:07.290 --> 34:10.458
It never feels threatened...
Not even now.

34:10.460 --> 34:12.248
And they did send you here, right?

34:12.250 --> 34:13.708
Yes.

34:13.710 --> 34:16.208
There are those who think
it's a fool's errand.

34:16.210 --> 34:18.918
There are others who fear I'm too late.

34:18.920 --> 34:21.460
If that's true, then why are you alone?

34:23.036 --> 34:24.579
If Damien is who you think he is,

34:24.580 --> 34:27.396
then shouldn't there be
an army of priests here?

34:28.420 --> 34:30.579
The Vatican doesn't fight wars.

34:30.580 --> 34:32.750
It handles things quietly.

34:34.846 --> 34:36.460
Are you an assassin?

34:40.210 --> 34:42.114
I am a pilgrim...

34:43.290 --> 34:45.790
here seeking the truth.

34:48.444 --> 34:51.619
I have to look closer
at Rutledge and Lyons.

34:51.620 --> 34:53.379
I'll call you tomorrow.

34:53.976 --> 34:55.290
Be safe.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.209
Oh!

36:44.210 --> 36:45.550
Greta, listen. I...

37:42.710 --> 37:45.510
Dude, before you slam the door
in my face, just hear me out.

37:51.330 --> 37:54.630
Look, you were right...
About everything.

37:55.259 --> 37:56.789
I was in on it.

37:56.790 --> 37:58.669
Only, I didn't know it.

37:59.496 --> 38:01.289
I met this chick at the Collective.

38:01.290 --> 38:02.677
We hooked up.

38:03.479 --> 38:05.210
She's Ann Rutledge's daughter.

38:06.290 --> 38:07.921
All right? I just found out.

38:10.173 --> 38:11.541
I'm sorry.

38:21.790 --> 38:23.290
No.

38:26.330 --> 38:27.670
I am.

38:30.049 --> 38:32.089
For getting you into all this.

38:42.884 --> 38:45.120
Things made more sense
in the field, huh.

38:47.471 --> 38:48.652
Yeah.

38:49.210 --> 38:52.420
Whatever's going on, man, I'm with you.

38:54.710 --> 38:56.620
Till the very end.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.170
I'm gonna have a beer.

39:12.766 --> 39:14.040
You want one?

39:33.018 --> 39:34.310
Hello, Charles.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.911
My name is Dr. Matthews.

39:37.912 --> 39:40.209
I'm here to have a little chat with you.

39:40.210 --> 39:41.289
Who are you?

39:42.468 --> 39:43.971
You're not my lawyer.

39:44.570 --> 39:45.979
I'm a friend of Damien's.

39:46.982 --> 39:48.692
- Is he here?
- No.

39:51.128 --> 39:53.306
He told me he wishes you were dead.

39:59.519 --> 40:02.138
Bobby. You set up my guy in
the, uh, interview room?

40:02.139 --> 40:05.073
Yep. Good to go. Oh, his,
uh, doctor's in with him.

40:05.074 --> 40:06.688
- What doctor?
- The shrink.

40:06.689 --> 40:08.491
She was called for a psych eval.

40:09.693 --> 40:11.431
She said you knew about it.

40:20.759 --> 40:22.155
Damien didn't mean to hurt me.

40:22.614 --> 40:24.250
Oh, but he did.

40:27.113 --> 40:29.700
Damien didn't want Cray Marquand dead.

40:31.111 --> 40:32.619
He wanted you dead.

40:33.107 --> 40:35.169
- What?
- You failed him, Charles.

40:39.330 --> 40:42.079
He called you a "sick freak."

40:44.759 --> 40:45.963
I don't believe you.

40:46.550 --> 40:49.169
- Damien loves me.
- How could he love you?

40:51.620 --> 40:53.979
You're not a true servant.
You're a liar.

40:55.489 --> 40:56.449
Guard!

40:58.597 --> 41:00.136
You're not worthy, Charles.

41:00.137 --> 41:02.939
- Guard! Get me out of here!
- You are nothing!

41:17.551 --> 41:20.050
Shots fired! Down the hall!
