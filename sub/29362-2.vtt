ANNOUNCER: AHS 1984.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.967
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.317 --> 00:15.015
FX presents Mr. InBetween.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.173
How you going?

01:26.216 --> 01:27.391
Hello.

01:27.435 --> 01:30.960
Uh, my daughter Brittany
goes to school with...

01:31.003 --> 01:32.396
your daughter Taylor.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.398
Yeah. Yeah.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.052
And, um,

01:36.096 --> 01:39.186
apparently, uh,
Taylor's been...

01:39.229 --> 01:41.536
bullying my daughter,

01:41.579 --> 01:44.060
saying stuff to her,putting stuff up on the Internet

01:44.104 --> 01:46.236
-and... That kind of stuff.
-My daughter wouldn't do that,
so...

01:46.280 --> 01:47.933
Okay.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.935
Well, can you talk to her
and find out?

01:49.979 --> 01:51.502
'Cause I don't think my
daughter's gonna lie about it.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.374
How did you get my address?

01:53.417 --> 01:55.811
Look, love,I'm not here to cause problems.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.160
-I'm just here...
-Don't call me "love," mate.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.381
Okay. All right.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.034
What?

02:02.078 --> 02:03.775
Do you think
you scare me or something,

02:03.819 --> 02:07.170
-coming around here?
-I'm not trying to scare you.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.129
I'm gonna go inside now.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.870
-Okay.-And I'm gonna call my brother.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.568
Oh?

02:13.611 --> 02:15.439
He's a cop.

02:15.483 --> 02:17.398
Mm. Scary.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.879
You gonna go now, or...

02:20.923 --> 02:22.446
Don't be a dickhead.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.021
MAN:
There's not much
I can do for me.

02:34.066 --> 02:36.852
You lose independence.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.897
Nancy loses hers.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.860
I think she's hanging it tough.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.949
Fuck!

04:25.569 --> 04:28.398
♪ Maria♪

04:28.442 --> 04:32.794
♪ Gratia plena♪

04:34.186 --> 04:36.145
♪ Maria♪

04:36.188 --> 04:38.103
♪ Gratia♪

04:38.147 --> 04:39.540
♪ Plena.♪

04:39.583 --> 04:41.585
Give me five minutes.

04:55.251 --> 04:57.122
You want coffee?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.950
You got any decaf?

04:58.994 --> 04:59.951
Decaf?

04:59.995 --> 05:01.562
Serious?

05:01.605 --> 05:03.346
I can't drink caffeine anymore.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.565
Why not?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.828
Makes me sweat too much.

05:10.222 --> 05:11.485
So, you got any?

05:12.573 --> 05:14.575
No, we only got
real coffee, mate.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.973
You counting it?

05:25.412 --> 05:27.414
Could've miscounted.

05:27.457 --> 05:28.763
Yeah. Yeah, I could've.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.288
So, what's with the no socks?

05:33.333 --> 05:35.291
It's called fashion, mate.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.771
-Is it?
-Yeah.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.555
Yeah, it's not something
you'd know too much about.

05:40.470 --> 05:43.299
Right.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.867
So, this guy wants to talk
to you about a piece of work.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.651
-Mm.
-It's all very hush-hush.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.958
-Eh.
-Do you want to meet with him?

05:50.001 --> 05:52.221
-Who is he?
-I don't know.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.441
One of his guys came in lastnight and spoke to me about it.

05:54.484 --> 05:55.442
Says it's a big job.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.921
Lot of money.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.620
And he just wants
to meet with me?

05:59.663 --> 06:01.099
Yeah.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.451
Set it up.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.366
All right.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.582
-How you going?
-Alex.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.061
-Ray. Good to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Ray.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.628
-This is Kev.
-Kev, how are you, mate?
-How are you?

06:51.672 --> 06:54.544
You come well-recommended.

06:55.589 --> 06:57.286
What can I do for you?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.594
Heard of a guy called
Vinny Williams?

07:01.638 --> 07:03.248
Yeah.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.686
Prez of the, uh, Dead Birds.

07:06.991 --> 07:09.603
Yeah.
You know him?

07:09.646 --> 07:11.648
Yeah, I met him once or twice.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.609
Through a mate of mine.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.045
Huh.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.568
Still interested?

07:20.918 --> 07:22.920
It's gonna cost you.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.273
Name your price.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.058
Why do you want him whacked?

07:30.101 --> 07:31.625
Does it matter?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.236
Yeah.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.413
I'm his VP.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.198
Personality clash, huh?

07:40.242 --> 07:42.244
Yeah, yeah.
Something like that.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.682
How much?

07:49.556 --> 07:51.122
250.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.602
Done.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.695
-100 up front.
-Sure.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.531
You cancel the job,
I keep the cash, okay?

08:08.575 --> 08:09.706
'Course.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.756
Thank you.
See you when the job's done.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.758
-Catch you later.
-Yeah. Good to meet you, man.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.500
-Cheers.
-ALEX: Let's go.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.569
Brucey?

08:46.613 --> 08:47.744
Bruce!

08:47.788 --> 08:50.530
BRUCE:
In the dunny.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.928
RAY:
Shit, mate. What happened?

08:57.972 --> 09:00.627
I just thought
I'd have a lie-down.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.369
How long you been in here for?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.850
Not long.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.157
RAY:
All right.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.420
Now give me your hand.
Ah, fuck.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.726
Can you get
that hand out of there?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.031
-Can you get that hand out?

09:14.075 --> 09:15.816
-Right.
-Okay.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.687
Chuck that up there, mate.
Can you get a hand on that?

09:17.731 --> 09:19.602
-Huh?

09:19.646 --> 09:22.170
Okay, so what I'm gonna do,
I'm just gonna pull you up.

09:22.213 --> 09:25.521
-Watch your head.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.438
Aw, shit.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.703
All right.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.836
All right, let me get
under your arms.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.881
All right.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.188
-All right, count of three.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.757
All right.
One... two...

09:43.800 --> 09:47.761
-three!

09:49.676 --> 09:51.503
-You all right?
-I'm all right.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.985
-All right.
-I'm all right.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.121
We'll have to get you a carer.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.559
I'm not having a fucking carer.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.952
Fair enough.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.258
Well, you can't live here, mate.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.564
You could have died.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.957
So?

10:11.915 --> 10:13.656
What, you given up, have you?

10:13.700 --> 10:15.702
I've had enough.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.272
Why don't you come live with me?

10:21.316 --> 10:23.100
I want to live here.

10:23.144 --> 10:24.319
I know you want
to live here, mate,

10:24.362 --> 10:26.060
but you can't live here anymore.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.062
-I'll put you in the garage.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.890
I'll put a bed in there,

10:29.933 --> 10:32.762
bloody TV,
whatever you need, mate.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.590
Britt'll be there.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.592
All right, she'd love it
if you're there all the time.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.423
What do you reckon?

10:43.773 --> 10:45.035
I'll think about it.

10:45.079 --> 10:46.907
Okay, that's good,
that's good enough.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.822
All right.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.911
-You want a cuppa?
-Meh.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.782
Yeah.

10:56.090 --> 10:58.179
-There's no milk.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.224
Oh, for fuck's sake.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.099
GARY:
Th-That's the official story,
but, you know.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.578
RAY:
Yeah, but I think...

11:06.622 --> 11:08.711
I think there was a guy behind

11:08.755 --> 11:11.932
-the fence on the knoll
-No, but that doesn't make
any sense.

11:11.975 --> 11:12.715
See, I don't think
there was anyone

11:12.759 --> 11:14.717
on the grassy knoll
behind the fence.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.588
I think the shooter
was in the pergola.

11:16.632 --> 11:17.981
RAY:
Where's the pergola?

11:18.025 --> 11:19.548
Well, the pergola's
on the grassy knoll,

11:19.591 --> 11:21.419
but it's-it's up near...

11:21.463 --> 11:23.160
more up north towards

11:23.204 --> 11:25.336
the depository--
it's the big white building,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.730
-the-the concrete one.
-Mm.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.732
Yeah. And, uh...
And this ch...

11:29.776 --> 11:31.778
and there's a photo--
there's two blokes,

11:31.821 --> 11:33.562
that are hiding in the pergola,and I reckon

11:33.605 --> 11:35.738
that's where
the head shots come from.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.566
And when the limo
comes around the corner,

11:37.609 --> 11:39.002
-where does it stop?
-Mm?

11:39.046 --> 11:40.525
Where does it stop, eh?

11:40.569 --> 11:42.789
In front of the pergola.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.660
Well, the limo didn't stop.

11:44.704 --> 11:45.922
How do you know it doesn't stop?

11:45.966 --> 11:47.010
Well, you look at the film,
it doesn't.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.229
It slows down
but it doesn't stop.

11:48.272 --> 11:49.665
-On the Zapruder film?
-Yeah.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.101
Oh.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.887
Well, that's bullshit because
the film's doctored, so...

11:53.930 --> 11:55.584
-The Zapruder film is doctored?-Yeah, of course. Yeah.

11:55.627 --> 11:57.238
-Who doctored the Zapruder film?-Everyone knows

11:57.281 --> 11:58.892
the Zapruder film's doctored--
it went missing for years.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.807
-I didn't...
-And-And then it came back.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.547
It resurfaced, like, eight
to 12 years later.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.593
-Now we're telling more
fantasies.
-The frames are missing.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.030
Yeah. That's right. Well, framesare missing, and... Yeah.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.771
It just-it just
doesn't make any sense.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.730
-It's fucking bullshit.
-Mm.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.734
So, yeah.

12:18.476 --> 12:19.913
You okay, babe?

12:19.956 --> 12:21.479
-: I want to go home.-Huh?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.873
Hey, what made you...
why did you shave it off?

12:23.917 --> 12:25.222
Your beard.
Why'd you shave it off?

12:25.266 --> 12:28.791
Well, because, uh,
Tat gets pash rash, so...

12:28.835 --> 12:31.228
-got to keep her happy.
-Oh.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.056
-Very nice of you.
-GARY: Yeah. You like it?

12:33.100 --> 12:34.797
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You like it?

12:34.841 --> 12:37.234
I do. Uh, it's...
Yeah, no, I do.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.801
-Actually, I do.
-Yeah?

12:38.845 --> 12:39.846
-It's good.
-Yeah, all right.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.586
Okay. There you go.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.632
Yeah, you look like
an '80s porn star.

12:43.675 --> 12:46.504
-Really?

12:46.548 --> 12:48.811
What?

12:48.855 --> 12:51.727
Babe? You all right?

12:52.859 --> 12:55.426
Have you told Ally
about you-know-what?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.080
What?

12:57.124 --> 12:59.517
Your pee-pee movies.

13:01.476 --> 13:03.913
Okay.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.220
-Pee-pee movies?

13:12.574 --> 13:15.011
-Oh... yeah.
-: What the fuck's
going on?

13:15.055 --> 13:16.883
-RAY: Nothing.
-Babe, time and a place.

13:16.926 --> 13:19.407
-Nothing? Bullshit. Nothing.
-Nothing's going on.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.104
-Come on, what? Spill.
-Nothing's going on.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.324
Come on, Ray.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.109
Well, you tell her.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.504
-TATIANA: Last year,

13:29.547 --> 13:33.029
Ray left a DVD at our house.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.944
Yeah.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.120
TATIANA:
Yes. And I found it.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.472
-Oh... Okay, what was the DVD?

13:41.516 --> 13:43.561
-Ow! Gary.
-What?

13:44.606 --> 13:46.347
Golden Shower Power.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.262
Oh, right, okay.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.352
So we are...
we're talking pornos?

13:51.395 --> 13:53.267
-Yes.
-Yeah, okay.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.921
Golden showers?

13:54.964 --> 13:58.533
-Mm.
-It's when people...
piss on each other?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.100
-Yes.
-Apparently. Yeah.
-Okay.

14:00.143 --> 14:04.017
ALLY:
Wow. Wow, okay.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.149
This is like a whole side of you

14:06.193 --> 14:08.717
that I have never seen before.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.154
-There's a lot you don't know.
-I know, clearly.

14:11.198 --> 14:12.895
Um...

14:12.939 --> 14:15.898
so are you-are you
the-the pisser

14:15.942 --> 14:17.552
or the pissee?

14:17.595 --> 14:19.075
Oh, either's fine.

14:19.119 --> 14:22.949
ALLY:
So you like
the taste of piss, or...

14:22.992 --> 14:23.906
RAY:
Oh, I don't mind it.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.429
-Mm. Okay.
-Mm.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.780
I need to go to toilet now,
so do you want me to wait?

14:28.824 --> 14:30.043
I was gonna go,
but do you want me to wait

14:30.086 --> 14:31.696
'til we get home, or...

14:31.740 --> 14:33.133
Yeah. Yeah, it'd be good
if you wait.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.395
-All right.
-Yeah.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.787
You guys have got it sorted out.

14:35.831 --> 14:36.963
-RAY: Mm.
-ALLY: : Mm.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.138
Right.
Right, you want another drink?

14:38.181 --> 14:39.748
I want to go home.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.141
-You want another drink?
-Yes, please.

14:41.184 --> 14:44.013
You want another drink?
Yeah? Get another one.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.494
Where's the, uh...

14:46.537 --> 14:48.626
It was his DVD, all right?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.150
She found it,

14:50.193 --> 14:52.282
and he tells her--
'cause he's, you know,

14:52.326 --> 14:53.980
I don't know,
he panicked or whatever--

14:54.023 --> 14:56.417
he tells her, "It's Ray's."

14:56.460 --> 14:58.071
And then he comes to me
and says,

14:58.114 --> 15:00.160
"Man, I need you to come
'round to my house

15:00.203 --> 15:02.553
and apologize."

15:02.597 --> 15:04.120
Right? Which I did.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.035
And say...

15:06.079 --> 15:08.385
you know, it's my DVD.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.780
Why would you leave a porno

15:11.823 --> 15:13.825
-at somebody else's house?
-That's what I said to him.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.392
Why the fuck would I...

15:15.436 --> 15:17.786
Like, not only why would
I leave it at your house,

15:17.829 --> 15:19.570
but why the fuck would
I bring a porno into your...

15:19.614 --> 15:21.529
-Like, who comes
into somebody's house

15:21.572 --> 15:23.966
and you bring a porno with you?You know that I mean?

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
And then you leave it,
and, y-you know what I mean?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.883
-And you go.
-I know. I don't...

15:27.927 --> 15:29.624
-It doesn't
make any fucking sense.
-No.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.539
BRITTANY:
Dad,

15:31.582 --> 15:33.236
why don't you like sandwiches?

15:34.281 --> 15:36.022
Uh...

15:36.065 --> 15:38.372
I like toasted sandwiches.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.809
Just don't like the raw ones,
that's all.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.593
Why?

15:43.943 --> 15:46.989
Uh... I don't know.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.034
Why do you like them?

15:48.077 --> 15:50.906
-Because they're yummy.
-Mm.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.257
Who's that?

15:54.301 --> 15:56.085
Don't know.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.271
-Who is it?
-Go to your room.

16:08.315 --> 16:09.969
-Why?
-Go to your room, please.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.630
MALE OFFICER:
Afternoon, sir.

16:19.674 --> 16:20.980
Are you Ray Shoesmith?

16:24.287 --> 16:26.376
I don't answer questions.
Can I help you?

16:26.420 --> 16:28.291
We're looking for
a Ray Shoesmith.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.337
Does he live here?

16:32.730 --> 16:34.297
I don't answer questions.

16:34.341 --> 16:37.431
Okay. Is there somebody here
who can answer questions?

16:37.474 --> 16:40.260
I don't answer questions.

16:40.303 --> 16:43.437
Okay. I don't really know
how to respond to that, sir.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.093
We just spoke to a woman
by the name of Petra Jenkins.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.270
She says you threatened her
and tried to menace her.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.272
-Did she?
-Yeah.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.100
You got anything you want to sayabout that?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.973
I don't answer questions.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.671
Would you mind telling us why?

17:00.715 --> 17:02.891
I don't answer questions.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.066
Okay.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.289
See ya.

17:09.332 --> 17:11.117
We'll come back later.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.162
Okay.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.124
FEMALE OFFICER:
Friendly chap.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.213
MALE OFFICER:
That's just weird.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.749
-What?
-Nothing.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.669
ALLY:
If something happened to me...

17:41.712 --> 17:44.019
like, if I was in--

17:44.063 --> 17:46.152
I don't know--
like an accident or something,

17:46.195 --> 17:49.111
and I was in a wheelchair...

17:49.155 --> 17:51.157
would you look after me?

17:53.420 --> 17:55.422
Yeah.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.426
What if I was,
like, a quadriplegic?

18:01.645 --> 18:04.126
Is that the ones
that can use their arms,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.910
but they can't use their legs?

18:05.954 --> 18:07.390
No, that's a paraplegic.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.263
Quadriplegics can't use
their arms or their legs.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.833
So, what, you'd just
be lying in bed all day?

18:15.877 --> 18:18.140
Pretty much.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.968
I'd probably put a pillow
over your head

18:20.011 --> 18:22.013
and put you out of your misery.

18:24.364 --> 18:26.279
Serious?

18:26.322 --> 18:28.107
Well, why would you want
to live like that?

18:29.804 --> 18:31.849
What if I wanted to live?

18:34.243 --> 18:36.245
Hmm.

18:37.246 --> 18:38.769
So how would we have sex?

18:39.988 --> 18:42.338
Well, quadriplegics can't
feel anything down there.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.993
Yeah, but we could still
have sex, though, right?

18:45.036 --> 18:46.560
So you'd still want
to have sex with me

18:46.603 --> 18:48.431
even if I couldn't
feel anything?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.433
Why wouldn't I want
to have sex with you?

18:50.477 --> 18:51.826
Sure.

18:51.869 --> 18:53.958
-Knock yourself out.

18:54.002 --> 18:56.222
Just don't complain
I'm a dead root.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.876
But you're a dead root
anyway and I don't complain.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.706
-Thanks very much.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.840
What are you doing?

19:07.233 --> 19:09.235
You'll see.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.851
Aw, is that for me?

19:16.894 --> 19:19.636
No, it's for the dude
on the park bench over there.

19:22.726 --> 19:25.251
There is no dude
over there on the park bench.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.861
Yes, there is.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.255
It's my imaginary boyfriend.

19:29.298 --> 19:32.301
He said he'd look after me
if I was a quadriplegic.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.911
Yeah, well,
I said I'd look after you.

19:35.043 --> 19:36.262
Oh, good.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.833
Just wanted to make sure we weregonna have sex, that's all.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.098
-Thanks.
-This is good, yeah.

21:14.142 --> 21:15.578
Wow. Thank you.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.319
They'll love this at work.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.629
Yeah, she's all right now.

21:24.152 --> 21:26.589
She was pretty upset, but...

21:26.633 --> 21:29.331
I don't think she's gonna
have any more problems.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.943
Were you bullied at school?

21:32.987 --> 21:34.597
Mm-hmm.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.816
Bad?

21:35.859 --> 21:37.383
Pretty bad.

21:37.426 --> 21:38.384
Were you beaten up?

21:38.427 --> 21:39.863
Mm-hmm.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.432
Well, what was this--
all through school?

21:45.434 --> 21:48.394
Um... probably up until about...

21:48.437 --> 21:50.613
halfway through grade six.

21:50.657 --> 21:52.789
-Well, it stopped?
-Mm-hmm.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.618
Why did it stop?

21:55.662 --> 21:57.838
Fought back.

21:57.881 --> 22:00.623
What happened?

22:00.667 --> 22:02.016
Oh, there was this little prick,

22:02.059 --> 22:05.411
and he'd been bullying me
for about two years.

22:05.454 --> 22:06.890
And, um...

22:08.849 --> 22:11.286
...this one day, you know,
we were playing downball,

22:11.330 --> 22:14.637
and he just started
getting stuck into me, and,

22:14.681 --> 22:17.248
you know, and I started crying,

22:17.292 --> 22:19.294
and... and he just
kept following me,

22:19.338 --> 22:20.861
just kept saying shit to me,

22:20.904 --> 22:22.863
-just wouldn't leave it alone,
you know?
-Mm.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.779
And I just grabbed him and threwhim up against a wall, and...

22:27.346 --> 22:29.478
...just beat the absolute fuck
out of him.

22:31.698 --> 22:33.656
And he stopped?

22:33.700 --> 22:35.702
He sure did.

22:38.052 --> 22:40.533
It's always better
to give than receive.

22:40.576 --> 22:41.838
Is it?

22:44.493 --> 22:45.668
Fuck yeah.

22:45.712 --> 22:47.714
Why do you say that?

22:49.498 --> 22:51.674
Well, you got
to fight back, you know?

22:51.718 --> 22:53.110
Otherwise...

22:54.677 --> 22:56.070
Otherwise what?

22:56.113 --> 22:58.115
Otherwise, people will
walk all over you.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.856
You know?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.684
I mean, that's the thing.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.207
Look, I wasn't
looking for trouble as a kid.

23:03.251 --> 23:04.426
You know?

23:04.470 --> 23:07.037
But I learned there's people
in this world who will

23:07.081 --> 23:09.605
take and take till
there's nothing left of you.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.653
I used to get angry about it.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.611
Well, I...
I used to get angry at myself,

23:15.655 --> 23:17.483
'cause I couldn't
do nothing about it.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.093
-You know what I mean?
-Mm.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.138
Like, I felt...

23:21.182 --> 23:22.444
I felt like I was weak.

23:22.488 --> 23:24.707
You know what I mean?

23:28.755 --> 23:30.670
Um...

23:30.713 --> 23:32.149
I can remember...

23:32.193 --> 23:33.673
I took a razor blade

23:33.716 --> 23:35.849
out of the, um,
the bathroom cupboard.

23:37.372 --> 23:40.288
I went down to the swings
at the end of the street.

23:40.331 --> 23:42.551
And I'm sitting there
and I'm thinking, you know,

23:42.595 --> 23:44.118
"I'm gonna top meself."
You know?

23:44.161 --> 23:45.554
"I've had enough."

23:45.598 --> 23:46.860
'Cause I was
getting hit at home,

23:46.903 --> 23:49.471
I was getting hit
at school, you know?

23:49.515 --> 23:51.517
And, um...

23:53.562 --> 23:55.869
But I couldn't do it, you know?

23:55.912 --> 23:58.045
And then, I felt like,
"Geez, you weak bastard,

23:58.088 --> 23:59.481
you can't, you know,
you can't even kill yourself."

23:59.525 --> 24:01.048
You know what I mean?

24:01.091 --> 24:03.050
And I thought,

24:03.093 --> 24:05.052
"Is it 'cause
I don't want to die

24:05.095 --> 24:07.446
or is it 'causeI'm just afraid to cut myself?"

24:10.144 --> 24:13.669
So I took the razor blade
and I cut me hand up.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
