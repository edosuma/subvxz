00:00.075 --> 00:01.613
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "Childhood's End"...</i>

00:01.734 --> 00:03.807
<i>At least 40 cities</i>
<i>around the world</i>

00:03.927 --> 00:05.894
<i>now have these vessels</i>
<i>hovering over them.</i>

00:05.929 --> 00:07.829
- My name is Karellen.
- Suffering will end.

00:07.864 --> 00:09.398
Injustice will end.

00:09.432 --> 00:10.732
<i>It's world peace.</i>

00:10.767 --> 00:12.601
<i>All hold hands and sing Kumbaya.</i>

00:12.635 --> 00:15.137
<i>This is an invasion.</i>

00:15.171 --> 00:16.271
Ahh!
My eyes!

00:16.306 --> 00:17.272
Why are you here?

00:17.307 --> 00:18.573
We need a messenger.

00:18.608 --> 00:20.175
<i>The birth rate is soaring.</i>

00:20.209 --> 00:23.145
<i>We have a world that we are</i>
<i>proud to bring children into.</i>

00:23.179 --> 00:25.347
<i>It's the golden age</i>
<i>of man, Utopia.</i>

00:25.381 --> 00:27.215
<i>Why did you make this room?</i>

00:27.250 --> 00:28.784
<i>Why did you send me Annabel?</i>

00:28.818 --> 00:31.920
<i>Because she is still the most</i>
<i>important thing in your life.</i>

00:31.955 --> 00:34.156
One day you'll understand
why I came back

00:34.190 --> 00:35.424
and why he built the room.

00:35.458 --> 00:36.491
Ricky?

00:36.526 --> 00:38.226
Karellen
is not letting you move on.

00:38.261 --> 00:39.895
Are you stealing
the Titan drives?

00:39.929 --> 00:40.929
Private research.

00:40.964 --> 00:42.264
<i>For 20 years, the Overlords</i>

00:42.298 --> 00:44.900
<i>have told us precisely nothing</i>
<i>about themselves.</i>

00:44.934 --> 00:46.001
I'm a guy
that likes to know stuff.

00:46.035 --> 00:47.869
It's Karellen.
He's back.

00:47.904 --> 00:49.638
Very good to see you, Ricky.

00:49.672 --> 00:52.341
He said that the Earth
has a new destiny.

00:54.310 --> 00:56.144
<i>Karellen said that there was</i>
<i>something in the fabric</i>

00:56.179 --> 00:57.746
<i>of the ship that poisoned me.</i>

00:57.780 --> 00:59.047
Help us!

00:59.082 --> 01:01.850
Karellen said that something
special was coming.

01:01.884 --> 01:03.585
Don't touch us.

01:04.721 --> 01:06.054
I take it you're the Greggsons.

01:06.089 --> 01:09.524
Our son Tommy is having
some behavioral issues.

01:11.995 --> 01:13.595
Tom just said
the strangest thing.

01:13.629 --> 01:14.596
- Jennifer.
- What?

01:14.630 --> 01:16.598
I know what to call the baby.

01:16.632 --> 01:19.334
We need to reclaim some of
what we had when we were kids.

01:19.369 --> 01:21.036
We're not moving to New Athens.

01:21.070 --> 01:22.471
It might be good for all of us.

01:22.505 --> 01:23.972
We need to add these people
to the guest list.

01:24.007 --> 01:25.674
This gentleman wants to fly me

01:25.708 --> 01:27.042
to South Africa
for a job interview.

01:27.076 --> 01:28.377
Your whole family's invited.

01:28.411 --> 01:30.379
- Milo Rodricks.
- Jake Greggson.

01:30.413 --> 01:31.947
- Here's my card.
- He's here.

01:31.981 --> 01:33.181
The supervisor for Earth.

01:33.216 --> 01:35.384
You're killing
scientific curiosity.

01:35.418 --> 01:38.653
Your scientific curiosity
would've destroyed you.

01:38.688 --> 01:40.856
The supervisor would like
to meet with you.

01:43.526 --> 01:45.694
We'll find a new voice
inside you.

01:47.597 --> 01:48.563
Tom!

01:48.598 --> 01:49.831
Jennifer, she's awake.

01:49.866 --> 01:52.434
No!

01:52.468 --> 01:54.169
So each symbol is a letter.

01:54.203 --> 01:55.303
This one is new.

01:55.338 --> 01:56.671
I recognize the pattern, Rachel.

02:00.276 --> 02:01.710
Jennifer.

Hey.

Hi.

02:14.724 --> 02:16.124
Want to say hi to Mommy?

02:16.159 --> 02:17.759
Jennifer.

02:17.794 --> 02:20.662
Hey, Jennifer.

02:20.696 --> 02:22.064
Hello, pretty girl.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.420
When the Overlords came,

03:18.454 --> 03:20.222
they helped us put away
childish notions

03:20.256 --> 03:22.090
based on greed and fear,

03:22.125 --> 03:23.425
but this is nothing compared

03:23.459 --> 03:25.861
to what they've inspired
in the younger generation.

03:25.895 --> 03:27.362
They eat better food

03:27.396 --> 03:28.697
and breathe better air

03:28.731 --> 03:30.999
and are enjoying the healthiest,

03:31.033 --> 03:35.637
stress-free lives
human beings have ever known.

03:35.671 --> 03:38.740
As a consequence,
the next generation is fitter,

03:38.774 --> 03:42.277
stronger, healthier.

03:42.311 --> 03:45.981
Human 2.1.

03:46.015 --> 03:49.818
Can you imagine what
their children will be like?

03:49.852 --> 03:55.123
Undoubtedly, we are evolving.

03:55.158 --> 03:58.293
So what are we evolving into?

04:14.177 --> 04:17.411
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Ntaga.

04:17.446 --> 04:19.848
I'm recording infant anomalies,

04:19.882 --> 04:21.483
changes in the young children,

04:21.517 --> 04:24.819
the kind of stuff the Overlords
are taking an interest in.

04:24.854 --> 04:26.054
That's nice for you.

04:28.324 --> 04:32.260
For your experiment,
start with the juice.

04:32.295 --> 04:34.329
Sami likes his juice.

04:34.363 --> 04:36.164
Okay.

04:43.673 --> 04:45.473
Do you want some juice, Sami?

04:56.118 --> 04:57.619
He always wants his juice.

04:58.921 --> 05:01.423
<i>♪ Only you ♪</i>

05:01.457 --> 05:03.024
<i>Mr. Hallcross,</i>

05:03.059 --> 05:05.760
<i>it sounds like you're talking</i>
<i>about an armed resistance.</i>

05:05.795 --> 05:06.861
<i>That's not correct.</i>

05:06.896 --> 05:08.496
<i>But you were in the military.</i>

05:08.531 --> 05:10.765
<i>Yes, I was military,</i>
<i>but I'm not anymore.</i>

05:10.800 --> 05:12.434
<i>You're twisting my words.</i>

05:12.468 --> 05:14.736
<i>What we're talking about here</i>
<i>is sanctuary.</i>

05:14.770 --> 05:16.738
<i>Sanctuary from what exactly?</i>

05:16.772 --> 05:18.640
<i>Looks what's happening</i>
<i>in your Utopia.</i>

05:18.674 --> 05:20.976
<i>Look what's happening</i>
<i>to your beloved prophet,</i>

05:21.010 --> 05:23.979
<i>who, by the way, is being held</i>
<i>together by alien Band-Aids.</i>

05:24.013 --> 05:26.548
<i>I'm inviting everyone</i>

05:26.582 --> 05:27.549
<i>You'll be safe here.</i>

05:27.583 --> 05:29.951
<i>Again, Jerry, safe from what?</i>

06:56.772 --> 06:59.207
You seem weaker.

07:01.510 --> 07:02.544
Yep.

07:06.115 --> 07:09.184
Well, we've had the good times,
right?

07:13.022 --> 07:14.856
And now we pay the check.

07:16.559 --> 07:19.627
The final stage has begun.

07:19.662 --> 07:22.430
I want to tell you
what will happen to the world.

07:34.543 --> 07:37.412
My friend, we are not
the authors of this plan.

07:37.446 --> 07:42.016
We are facilitators,

07:42.051 --> 07:44.753
midwives if you will,

07:44.787 --> 07:47.288
at the birth
of a new evolution of man.

07:50.259 --> 07:52.394
I take it
you've never been a father.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.799
I have 24 children.

08:07.510 --> 08:09.477
And we have none.

08:15.851 --> 08:18.353
I could spare you this.

08:20.189 --> 08:23.491
You don't have to remain here.

08:23.526 --> 08:27.829
If you want
to spare me something,

08:27.863 --> 08:31.332
how about you leave
the both of us alone?

08:43.846 --> 08:45.480
Hey, is she okay?

08:51.220 --> 08:53.354
Hey.

08:53.389 --> 08:56.758
Are you okay?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.359
Are you lost?

09:13.676 --> 09:16.511
Jennifer.

09:28.357 --> 09:31.326
Jennifer.

09:31.360 --> 09:35.196
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

09:35.231 --> 09:38.366
Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.

09:38.400 --> 09:43.738
Jennifer, Jennifer.

09:59.054 --> 10:00.154
Jennifer.

10:23.078 --> 10:24.746
What the hell?

10:36.492 --> 10:38.726
Some of these kids
can lift a cup.

10:38.761 --> 10:40.895
Some of them can move a car.

10:40.930 --> 10:42.397
I met a three-year-old girl
who had a knack

10:42.431 --> 10:44.699
for speaking to her parents
in their dreams,

10:44.733 --> 10:46.167
in three languages.

10:46.201 --> 10:48.570
I mean, their metabolic rates
have accelerated,

10:48.604 --> 10:50.905
and there's undoubtedly
increased electrical activity

10:50.940 --> 10:53.107
in the cerebrum.

10:53.142 --> 10:54.475
Bottom line:

10:54.510 --> 10:57.645
these are regular children
with cognitive, telekinetic,

10:57.680 --> 10:59.681
and psychic ability,
and they're all linked.

10:59.715 --> 11:01.049
All across the world,

11:01.083 --> 11:04.552
they are somehow...

11:04.587 --> 11:08.156
linked to one another.

11:08.190 --> 11:09.924
It all goes back
to the first one,

11:09.959 --> 11:12.860
the Greggson baby, Jennifer.

11:12.895 --> 11:14.095
She's the key.

11:16.765 --> 11:20.068
Hey, Jake, it's me again, Milo.

11:20.102 --> 11:21.782
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>you want to keep your family</i>

11:21.804 --> 11:23.504
<i>as normal as possible,</i>

11:23.539 --> 11:25.373
<i>but it's gone</i>
<i>way beyond that now.</i>

11:25.407 --> 11:27.875
<i>Look, I don't know</i>
<i>if you're aware of this,</i>

11:27.910 --> 11:31.713
<i>but kids all over the world</i>
<i>are saying the name Jennifer,</i>

11:31.747 --> 11:33.114
<i>and I think</i>
<i>it may have something</i>

11:33.148 --> 11:35.216
<i>to do with your daughter.</i>

11:35.250 --> 11:38.252
<i>Please, please, call me back.</i>

11:38.287 --> 11:39.921
She shows us things.

11:42.391 --> 11:44.192
What things?

11:44.226 --> 11:47.862
They're new worlds, Mom,
but I've not been before.

11:47.896 --> 11:50.031
She's taking me so far away
that even the Overlords

11:50.065 --> 11:51.099
haven't seen them.

11:56.105 --> 11:58.706
All right, guys,

11:58.741 --> 12:00.141
I don't care
where your parents are.

12:00.175 --> 12:03.778
I want you out of here
right now.

12:03.812 --> 12:05.279
I said right now!

12:45.921 --> 12:47.588
Hey, sweetheart.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.396
You have a lot
of new friends outside.

12:56.432 --> 12:59.534
What do they want
to see you for?

12:59.568 --> 13:01.202
I can see all of it.

13:01.236 --> 13:03.738
I see your fear,

13:03.772 --> 13:06.574
but there is no need
to be afraid.

13:27.262 --> 13:29.063
Are you sure about this?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.302
We don't need sheets, Amy,
just pack what we really need.

13:34.336 --> 13:36.037
The rest we can find
in New Athens.

13:36.071 --> 13:37.538
It's okay.
Hey, it's okay.

13:37.573 --> 13:38.873
Come on.

13:38.907 --> 13:41.409
I don't always feel
like I'm really here.

13:41.443 --> 13:43.578
You're not always here.

13:46.749 --> 13:49.217
<i>And now we can talk...</i>

13:49.251 --> 13:51.919
<i>like this.</i>

13:51.954 --> 13:54.889
<i>Yes, I hear you.</i>

13:54.923 --> 13:57.058
<i>Jennifer is all,</i>

13:57.092 --> 14:00.895
<i>divisible and indivisible</i>

14:00.929 --> 14:03.164
<i>in one mind</i>

14:03.198 --> 14:04.799
<i>that calls.</i>

14:04.833 --> 14:07.602
<i>She calls to us.</i>

14:07.636 --> 14:08.669
<i>We know you.</i>

14:08.704 --> 14:10.271
<i>We hear you, Jennifer.</i>

14:10.305 --> 14:12.373
<i>We hear you.</i>

14:12.407 --> 14:15.076
<i>You are the end</i>
<i>of the beginning.</i>

14:15.110 --> 14:16.744
Kids!

14:26.488 --> 14:28.122
Come on, Jen.
Come on.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.903
<i>Where do you go, Jennifer?</i>

14:41.937 --> 14:43.604
<i>Where do they take you?</i>

14:49.478 --> 14:53.881
<i>Your mother needs comfort, Tom.</i>

14:53.916 --> 14:54.882
<i>We see you.</i>

14:57.986 --> 14:59.720
Oh, my God.

15:03.358 --> 15:05.788
<i>Where do they take you?</i>

15:05.908 --> 15:08.529
<i>We must follow.</i>

15:35.027 --> 15:36.394
<i>Hello there.</i>

15:36.429 --> 15:38.964
<i>On behalf of everyone</i>
<i>here in the last free city</i>

15:38.998 --> 15:42.534
<i>on the planet,</i>
<i>welcome to New Athens.</i>

15:42.568 --> 15:43.768
<i>Whoever you are,</i>

15:43.803 --> 15:49.241
<i>I think you're gonna</i>
<i>fit right in.</i>

15:49.275 --> 15:51.977
<i>Although we have no specific</i>
<i>immigration process,</i>

15:52.011 --> 15:53.378
<i>we do ask that you read</i>

15:53.412 --> 15:55.247
<i>and complete</i>
<i>the introduction packs</i>

15:55.281 --> 15:58.216
<i>so that you</i>
<i>can formally register.</i>

15:58.251 --> 16:01.887
<i>Orientation seminars are held</i>
<i>in many sites around the city,</i>

16:01.921 --> 16:03.388
<i>and these will</i>
<i>help you get settled</i>

16:03.422 --> 16:05.857
<i>into living life the old way.</i>

16:08.895 --> 16:10.161
Name, please.

16:10.196 --> 16:12.264
The Greggson family.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.175
Welcome.

16:52.905 --> 16:54.072
All right, guys, let's go.

16:57.743 --> 17:00.512
You all right?

17:01.647 --> 17:03.315
Tom, Tom.

17:09.689 --> 17:12.156
<i>Hey, Jake, it's me again, Milo.</i>

17:12.191 --> 17:14.659
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>you want to keep your family</i>

17:14.694 --> 17:16.627
<i>as normal as possible,</i>

17:16.662 --> 17:18.296
<i>but it's gone</i>
<i>way beyond that now.</i>

17:18.330 --> 17:19.664
<i>I need to see Jennifer.</i>

17:19.699 --> 17:22.067
<i>We have to learn</i>
<i>what's happening to her.</i>

17:22.101 --> 17:24.769
<i>Please, please, call me back.</i>

17:40.252 --> 17:41.753
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

17:41.787 --> 17:44.089
Would you come with me, please?

17:44.123 --> 17:45.857
Um, what's the problem?

17:45.891 --> 17:47.993
- Just come with me, please.
- Sure.

17:48.027 --> 17:49.294
You're not in any trouble.

17:58.437 --> 18:00.639
Mr. Greggson,
welcome to New Athens.

18:00.673 --> 18:02.207
- Who are you?
- I'm Jerry Hallcross.

18:02.241 --> 18:04.309
I'm the closest thing
this place has to a mayor.

18:04.343 --> 18:06.478
Right.
I heard you on the radio.

18:06.512 --> 18:09.381
This is my wife, Amy,
my son, Tom,

18:09.415 --> 18:12.617
and this is our daughter.

18:12.652 --> 18:13.918
What's your name, sweetie?

18:13.953 --> 18:15.820
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

18:15.855 --> 18:17.922
I seem to be
hearing that name a lot.

18:23.496 --> 18:25.864
You're obviously very special.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.333
We welcome everyone here.
Okay?

18:28.367 --> 18:29.934
Maybe we can even help you.

18:32.672 --> 18:34.005
Guys, please, relax.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.407
You're not in any trouble.

18:35.441 --> 18:36.708
I'm here to help.

18:36.742 --> 18:37.942
Thank you, gentlemen.

18:40.980 --> 18:42.147
Come on.

18:42.181 --> 18:43.815
Okay, thank you.

18:46.352 --> 18:49.020
It really is beautiful.

18:49.055 --> 18:51.723
Of course, the majority
prefer Utopia,

18:51.757 --> 18:53.792
whatever "Utopia" really means.

18:53.826 --> 18:54.993
Can I ask you something?

18:55.027 --> 18:57.028
The Overlords,
they really leave you alone?

18:57.063 --> 18:58.263
They respect our decision

18:58.297 --> 19:00.231
not to live
in their perfect world,

19:00.266 --> 19:02.534
but do you know
what happens here?

19:02.568 --> 19:05.704
Culture returns,
art, self-expression.

19:05.738 --> 19:06.738
People screen movies.

19:06.772 --> 19:07.839
They put on plays.

19:07.873 --> 19:09.541
We even have the opera.

19:09.575 --> 19:12.077
This year it's "Don Giovanni."

19:12.111 --> 19:14.379
They wanted Karellen
to cameo as the Devil.

19:14.413 --> 19:16.815
Can you imagine
if that happened?

19:31.597 --> 19:34.999
Red numbers will end it.

19:41.107 --> 19:42.140
This is me.

19:42.174 --> 19:43.241
Come on up.

19:50.015 --> 19:51.316
Wow.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.684
This is you?

19:52.718 --> 19:54.385
- You're an artist?
- Yeah.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.121
In another life,
I was a command sergeant.

19:56.155 --> 19:59.457
- That facility out in the desert?
- Yeah.

19:59.492 --> 20:01.960
Spaceships came;
I was out of a job.

20:01.994 --> 20:03.194
Best thing that ever happened.

20:03.195 --> 20:04.863
Aren't you worried
that the Overlords

20:04.897 --> 20:06.664
might change their minds
about New Athens?

20:06.699 --> 20:09.567
I mean, what if they
try and dismantle it?

20:09.602 --> 20:10.769
Come on, Amy.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.405
No, I'm not, and if they did,
I wouldn't let it.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.542
This place is what I always
hoped it would be.

20:17.576 --> 20:20.745
Utopia is dull, right?

20:20.780 --> 20:23.848
I mean, to the creative mind,
peace is stupefying.

20:25.918 --> 20:28.920
Look, we're not radicals here.

20:28.954 --> 20:31.856
We're just trying to preserve
our cultural heritage.

20:31.891 --> 20:35.126
We're just trying to achieve
something for ourselves.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.396
I believe, I hope,

20:38.430 --> 20:43.735
I pray you're going
to change here,

20:43.769 --> 20:45.103
all of you.

20:49.975 --> 20:50.975
You too.

20:57.917 --> 20:58.983
Her name was Tilly.

21:03.422 --> 21:06.591
My daughter, my joy.

21:08.594 --> 21:11.296
She had a severe type of anemia.

21:11.330 --> 21:12.664
So unusual.

21:12.698 --> 21:16.100
I mean,
we can cure almost anything.

21:16.135 --> 21:19.604
Yes, with their interference.

21:19.638 --> 21:21.706
Tilly was getting stronger
with our medicines,

21:21.740 --> 21:25.076
so...

21:25.110 --> 21:28.079
so when she died, it--

21:28.113 --> 21:31.249
"The act of dying
is the act of life."

21:31.283 --> 21:33.818
Marcus Aurelius.

21:33.853 --> 21:37.388
Tilly left the stage
to applause.

21:48.634 --> 21:52.170
Jennifer will be
surrounded by life,

21:52.204 --> 21:56.474
you know, real human life.

21:56.508 --> 22:00.745
I'm hoping
that it will seep into her

22:00.779 --> 22:03.948
like some sort of medicine.

22:03.983 --> 22:06.017
It's a beautiful thought.

22:06.051 --> 22:08.987
But what if we're wrong?

22:09.021 --> 22:12.056
If New Athens fails,

22:12.091 --> 22:15.059
if that day comes,

22:15.094 --> 22:16.728
I'd rather see it burn.

22:22.668 --> 22:24.002
You want to hold that
in your left hand.

22:24.036 --> 22:25.069
Right here, all right?

22:25.104 --> 22:26.504
Keep a little bit of slack
in that.

22:26.538 --> 22:28.239
More towards the bottom,

22:28.274 --> 22:29.440
the bottom
of that loop right there.

22:29.475 --> 22:30.842
Here we go, ready?

22:30.876 --> 22:33.344
You're gonna keep it
at ten o'clock, two o'clock.

22:33.379 --> 22:35.446
Ten o'clock, two o'clock.

22:35.481 --> 22:36.981
Do I let this--wait,
do I let this go?

22:37.016 --> 22:39.584
No, no, no, no, hold onto that.

22:39.618 --> 22:40.585
You holding that line?

22:40.619 --> 22:41.819
- Hold that line.
- Yes, I am holding it.

22:41.854 --> 22:43.922
Keep it tight.
Okay, here we go.

22:43.956 --> 22:44.956
Keep it in a straight line.

22:44.990 --> 22:47.325
They're like shapeshifters.

22:47.359 --> 22:48.860
See?

22:48.894 --> 22:51.729
It goes--there's a whale.

22:51.764 --> 22:54.098
It's moving.

22:54.133 --> 22:57.568
It looks like something
out of a--

22:57.603 --> 23:01.472
like, a scary movie.

23:01.507 --> 23:02.473
Now.

23:02.508 --> 23:03.741
Open.

23:03.776 --> 23:04.776
Now?

23:11.650 --> 23:12.784
Aww...

23:14.887 --> 23:15.987
Ells.

23:29.301 --> 23:32.670
These are all from
before the Overlords came.

23:32.705 --> 23:34.939
Yeah.

23:34.974 --> 23:37.575
You and I had Utopia
before they came.

23:42.314 --> 23:43.314
Thank you.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.854
Home sweet home.

23:49.888 --> 23:50.855
Huh?

23:53.192 --> 23:54.158
Nice.

23:54.193 --> 23:55.860
Go, check out your rooms.

24:02.101 --> 24:03.768
It's nice.
Thank you.

24:03.802 --> 24:05.370
Anytime.

24:05.404 --> 24:06.804
Thanks.

24:06.839 --> 24:08.673
Anything you need,
just let me know.

24:08.707 --> 24:10.541
<i>Hey, Jennifer,</i>
<i>come check this out.</i>

24:13.278 --> 24:14.412
<i>It's so blue.</i>

24:14.446 --> 24:17.115
We can make this work.

24:27.292 --> 24:29.727
It's that scientist, Milo,

24:29.762 --> 24:31.662
calling again, isn't it?

24:31.697 --> 24:33.931
Yeah.

24:33.966 --> 24:36.901
If he wants to speak
to Jennifer, we should let him.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.970
- Why?
- I don't know.

24:39.004 --> 24:40.938
Maybe--

24:40.973 --> 24:43.808
Anything that can help us
understand Jennifer better

24:43.842 --> 24:45.510
is a good thing, right?

24:47.446 --> 24:48.446
<i>Milo, hi.</i>

24:51.383 --> 24:52.984
That's good.

24:53.018 --> 24:54.352
Lock this.

24:54.386 --> 24:57.055
Yeah, she's ready to go.

24:57.089 --> 24:59.023
Okay.

24:59.058 --> 25:02.226
Now, this won't take long.

25:02.261 --> 25:04.028
You okay, honey?

25:04.063 --> 25:05.830
All right, you see that?

25:05.864 --> 25:07.465
<i>It's all I could find.</i>

25:07.499 --> 25:09.167
It's fine.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.207
I don't like this, Milo.

25:16.241 --> 25:17.675
You have to understand

25:17.709 --> 25:20.711
that Jennifer
is the conduit of a force

25:20.746 --> 25:23.781
<i>that is affecting</i>
<i>every kid in the world.</i>

25:23.816 --> 25:27.151
<i>If you start testing her,</i>
<i>you'll be playing with fire.</i>

25:27.186 --> 25:31.622
Playing with fire
is how we learned to master it.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.658
We're staying in the room.

25:33.692 --> 25:35.393
It's just a few questions.

25:35.427 --> 25:37.328
It won't scare her.

25:37.362 --> 25:39.864
It's not her I'm worried about.

25:39.898 --> 25:42.033
Jennifer, hi.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.401
<i>Remember me?</i>

25:43.435 --> 25:45.303
<i>I want you to look</i>
<i>into the mirror.</i>

25:47.973 --> 25:49.173
You see into everything.

25:49.208 --> 25:50.641
I want you to see into yourself.

25:55.514 --> 25:58.182
What do you see when you
look into your own eyes?

26:00.219 --> 26:02.487
<i>Can you tell me what you see?</i>

26:02.521 --> 26:04.122
Do you see our future?

26:04.156 --> 26:06.991
Do you see the power
that gave you this gift?

26:08.227 --> 26:11.929
Please, Jennifer, just look.

26:11.964 --> 26:13.898
Can you tell me what this means?

26:16.935 --> 26:20.171
Jennifer, what do you see?

26:20.205 --> 26:21.739
I see all.

26:21.773 --> 26:23.608
<i>I am all.</i>

26:26.979 --> 26:28.012
Come closer.

26:48.967 --> 26:50.770
The end begins.

26:57.506 --> 26:59.173
Jennifer showed me this place,

26:59.208 --> 27:00.608
the rock promontory.

27:00.642 --> 27:02.110
Milo.

27:05.247 --> 27:06.781
Then she showed me
something else,

27:06.815 --> 27:08.616
something destructive.

27:08.650 --> 27:11.085
I think the Earth
could be in danger.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.620
I need to go there.

27:12.654 --> 27:13.888
Where exactly?

27:13.922 --> 27:16.290
To their planet,
to figure it out, I guess,

27:16.325 --> 27:17.525
to try and stop it.

27:17.559 --> 27:19.127
Milo, you can't just
go to their planet.

27:19.161 --> 27:20.161
Okay, look.

27:22.631 --> 27:25.366
The next time
you hand over an animal,

27:25.401 --> 27:27.201
I want to be on that ship.

27:27.236 --> 27:29.203
I mean, you can vacuum pack me.

27:29.238 --> 27:31.139
I mean, if the monkeys
and the snakes can survive,

27:31.173 --> 27:32.140
then I can too.

27:32.174 --> 27:33.241
You know,

27:33.275 --> 27:35.610
I think you're evolving,
like those kids.

27:35.644 --> 27:39.380
Your ego is becoming
super advanced.

27:42.317 --> 27:44.318
How could you ask me to do this?

27:46.088 --> 27:47.922
What do you mean?

28:08.644 --> 28:10.311
You brought this?

28:12.247 --> 28:15.616
My I.D.
from the kids' hospital,

28:15.651 --> 28:19.654
the one I believed the girl
in the next bed stole from me.

28:22.925 --> 28:24.592
It's where we started.

28:29.598 --> 28:31.332
But where will we finish?

28:33.936 --> 28:35.870
Hey.

28:35.904 --> 28:37.071
Together.

28:44.079 --> 28:48.483
There's a family movie day

28:48.517 --> 28:51.252
every Saturday afternoon.

28:51.286 --> 28:52.353
I saw a billboard.

28:52.387 --> 28:56.524
It's just up the street.

28:56.558 --> 28:58.759
Us, all together,

28:58.794 --> 29:01.629
watching a silly old movie?

29:05.200 --> 29:06.901
Yeah.

29:06.935 --> 29:08.769
Sounds good.

29:08.804 --> 29:10.138
Yeah.

29:52.447 --> 29:53.948
Please, don't go.

29:58.187 --> 29:59.520
Rachel, I--

30:25.214 --> 30:28.516
Rachel, what I saw--

30:28.550 --> 30:32.220
What if the world is in danger?

30:32.254 --> 30:35.356
You said yourself,

30:35.390 --> 30:36.757
the mystery is that girl,

30:36.792 --> 30:38.292
Jennifer.

30:39.995 --> 30:41.562
The mystery is here.

30:41.597 --> 30:43.331
Yeah.

30:43.365 --> 30:44.899
Look, you're right.

30:44.933 --> 30:47.468
The mystery is here,

30:47.502 --> 30:50.137
but the answer isn't.

30:50.172 --> 30:52.773
It's out there.

30:52.808 --> 30:55.109
Look, and I've done the math.

30:55.143 --> 30:58.579
It takes the Overlords 48 days
to get back to their planet,

30:58.614 --> 31:00.494
and they'll probably just
put me on a ship back.

31:00.515 --> 31:03.417
So call it 100 days, round trip.

31:04.720 --> 31:10.458
100 days
at para-light speed is--

31:10.492 --> 31:12.593
80 years here.

31:12.628 --> 31:17.265
But their ships
can come and go, right?

31:17.299 --> 31:19.500
Rachel, we know
they can manipulate time.

31:19.534 --> 31:20.534
Shut up.

31:23.705 --> 31:25.539
I'm coming back.

31:34.116 --> 31:35.850
Oh, God.

31:37.219 --> 31:38.185
Is it these?

31:45.327 --> 31:47.194
These things are useless.

31:57.339 --> 31:58.673
I'm scared.

31:58.707 --> 32:00.508
I'm so scared, Annabel.

32:05.847 --> 32:06.914
Annabel?

32:13.522 --> 32:15.356
I'm here, sweetheart.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.281
That's how we
put an animal into stasis.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.118
Right.

33:43.723 --> 33:46.057
What have you got there?

33:46.092 --> 33:48.159
Yeah, um...

33:49.595 --> 33:50.795
Okay.

33:50.830 --> 33:55.300
Adrenalin shot, high-concentrate
steroid injection.

33:55.334 --> 33:56.301
Great.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.769
That'll kick-start
muscle action.

33:57.803 --> 34:01.373
Full-spectrum vitamin shots,
mirtazapine anti-nausea meds,

34:01.407 --> 34:03.141
alkaline eye-hydration,

34:03.175 --> 34:05.477
a bottle of water,

34:05.511 --> 34:06.912
and a--

34:11.284 --> 34:13.083
and a granola bar.

34:17.023 --> 34:18.223
We don't know if they

34:18.257 --> 34:20.025
oxygenate the storage hangar
on the ships.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.092
Hey, hey, hey.

34:21.127 --> 34:22.928
What if you're wrong
about the ships?

34:22.962 --> 34:25.297
You'll be gone for 80 years.

34:42.915 --> 34:45.984
<i>Container prepped for stowing.</i>

34:46.018 --> 34:47.686
<i>Countdown, two minutes.</i>

34:47.719 --> 34:49.154
We don't have much time.

34:49.188 --> 34:50.621
Right.

34:50.656 --> 34:53.091
Will they run a scan
or something?

34:53.125 --> 34:56.393
They run a body mass reading,
but she's a big girl.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.296
You don't add
any suspicious extra weight.

34:58.331 --> 34:59.564
<i>Pressure steady.</i>

35:06.906 --> 35:08.607
That--

35:08.641 --> 35:09.708
that won't help.

35:11.077 --> 35:13.178
Will I dream at least?

35:13.212 --> 35:14.346
If you do,

35:14.380 --> 35:17.549
it'll be a 48-day nightmare
about suffocating.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.118
Fun.

35:22.355 --> 35:24.623
'Prepare to transfer specimen.'

35:30.796 --> 35:33.665
<i>Overlord ship</i>
<i>entering lower atmosphere.</i>

35:37.570 --> 35:38.536
Don't go.

35:38.571 --> 35:41.139
<i>One minute until transfer.</i>

35:44.343 --> 35:46.478
What?

35:46.512 --> 35:47.479
Rachel.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.814
I'm sorry.

35:49.849 --> 35:50.815
I'm sorry.

35:50.850 --> 35:52.751
I know you're scared too.

35:52.785 --> 35:55.487
Look, if I'm not back
in 100 days,

35:55.521 --> 35:57.355
get on the Orbital.

35:57.390 --> 35:58.823
It'll be safe there.

36:02.995 --> 36:04.663
Get yourself on the Orbital.

36:04.697 --> 36:06.765
Sleep the time away.
You'll figure it out.

36:06.799 --> 36:09.167
<i>Overlord ship</i>
<i>ready to receive specimen.</i>

36:09.201 --> 36:10.201
Here.

36:18.577 --> 36:20.512
Love, right?

36:20.546 --> 36:21.680
It means love.

36:21.714 --> 36:22.714
Yes.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.652
<i>30 seconds until transfer.</i>

36:31.090 --> 36:33.825
I'm coming back.

36:33.859 --> 36:34.859
You hear me?

36:34.894 --> 36:35.894
Okay, okay.

36:35.928 --> 36:37.429
You swear to come back.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.264
I'll swear to wait.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.966
<i>Stand by.</i>

36:42.001 --> 36:43.535
I swear.

36:45.071 --> 36:46.905
I swear too.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.777
<i>Stand by.</i>

37:05.925 --> 37:08.526
<i>Hibernation status satisfactory.</i>

39:02.873 --> 39:04.540
Mm.

39:13.550 --> 39:15.518
What time is it?

39:15.552 --> 39:18.254
Actually, it's the start.

39:18.288 --> 39:21.690
We're at the very start.

39:21.725 --> 39:23.225
Of what?

39:24.151 --> 39:27.029
The rest of our lives together.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.397
I got something for you.

39:30.431 --> 39:31.765
Oh.

39:41.809 --> 39:43.744
Oh.

39:43.778 --> 39:44.878
What?

39:44.913 --> 39:46.246
You said you wanted
to see the Yankees.

39:46.281 --> 39:48.515
Well, yeah.

39:48.550 --> 39:49.516
But hang on, do they

39:49.551 --> 39:52.152
play here in this room?

39:52.187 --> 39:54.621
Because we're not
leaving this room,

39:54.656 --> 39:56.323
not for three days.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.129
That's good.

40:02.163 --> 40:03.497
That's good.

40:05.607 --> 40:08.235
'Cause this honeymoon,
the Four Seasons,

40:08.269 --> 40:10.971
I might've run out of money.

40:11.005 --> 40:13.507
Okay, I yield.

40:13.541 --> 40:15.142
I yield.

40:47.642 --> 40:49.810
I have a confession to make.

40:52.413 --> 40:55.482
I didn't think that
you were gonna say yes

40:55.516 --> 40:57.284
when I proposed.

40:57.318 --> 40:58.585
Oh, is that what that was,

40:58.620 --> 40:59.853
a proposal,

40:59.887 --> 41:01.955
that business
with the Barry White

41:01.990 --> 41:03.523
and the red rose?

41:40.461 --> 41:41.628
Annabel.

41:45.733 --> 41:47.301
When did you have these taken?

41:50.405 --> 41:54.274
I don't remember.

41:54.309 --> 41:55.809
<i>I'm right beside you.</i>

41:58.346 --> 42:02.249
<i>Ricky, I'm sorry</i>
<i>you lost the love of your life.</i>

42:03.318 --> 42:04.651
<i>I'm here.</i>

42:15.363 --> 42:18.298
How did it get so late?

42:18.333 --> 42:20.300
Where did the day go?

42:24.439 --> 42:30.077
As surely as it rises,
the Sun also has to set.

42:32.380 --> 42:36.516
Someone said that to me once.

42:36.551 --> 42:40.687
Even the best day
in the world has to end,

42:40.722 --> 42:44.124
never to be repeated.

42:45.460 --> 42:49.863
Switch that mind off.

42:49.897 --> 42:51.631
There's nothing to worry about.

42:54.769 --> 42:56.069
We're safe.

42:56.104 --> 42:57.637
Cancer.

43:01.275 --> 43:03.076
She was so beautiful.

43:04.612 --> 43:08.515
She had a light.

43:08.549 --> 43:14.087
Finally, it went out.

43:14.122 --> 43:15.856
Why are you talking like this?

43:15.890 --> 43:17.190
This is special,

43:17.225 --> 43:20.627
and we're happy,
so why spoil it?

43:20.661 --> 43:23.096
You're going to stay
in this room with me.

43:27.068 --> 43:30.337
I begged you to stay, Annabel.

43:30.371 --> 43:34.608
I begged you
not to let your light go,

43:34.642 --> 43:35.942
but you couldn't.

44:05.873 --> 44:09.176
I thought I'd never love again.

44:09.210 --> 44:11.411
I thought would be a sin to.

44:11.446 --> 44:13.947
It doesn't have to be like this.

44:13.981 --> 44:15.482
But it was like this.

44:18.553 --> 44:21.021
I mean, that's how she died.

44:21.055 --> 44:22.923
But it wasn't here.

44:25.359 --> 44:28.462
I can give her back to you.

44:28.496 --> 44:32.799
I can slow down time
in this place.

44:32.834 --> 44:36.369
You can stay here
and never leave

44:36.404 --> 44:39.239
if that's what you want.

44:39.273 --> 44:40.874
It isn't real.

44:40.908 --> 44:44.811
<i>It's a gift</i>
<i>from one friend to another.</i>

44:44.846 --> 44:47.180
<i>The Sun doesn't have to set.</i>

44:47.215 --> 44:51.585
Oh, just stop, please.

45:07.835 --> 45:11.638
You put that here, not me.

45:15.643 --> 45:17.477
I'm so sorry.

45:22.583 --> 45:24.885
I'm so sorry.

45:50.444 --> 45:52.078
This room...

45:52.113 --> 45:53.280
Mm-hmm?

45:56.117 --> 45:57.584
Bury it.

46:31.919 --> 46:34.254
Sweetheart?

46:34.288 --> 46:37.424
Ricky, baby, come back inside.

46:39.560 --> 46:41.494
Oh, jeez.

46:41.529 --> 46:44.698
Ells, you're so beautiful.

46:44.732 --> 46:45.999
Let's go inside.

46:46.033 --> 46:47.634
I'm gonna lie here.

46:47.668 --> 46:50.337
I'm just catching my breath.

46:50.371 --> 46:51.605
Okay.

46:54.609 --> 46:59.112
I never loved anyone
more than you, Ells.

47:01.849 --> 47:03.650
Never.

47:15.997 --> 47:17.297
What's that one?

47:29.910 --> 47:33.413
Is it the two-headed rooster?

47:33.447 --> 47:35.415
Two-headed rooster?

47:40.588 --> 47:42.722
That one's the frog.

47:42.757 --> 47:46.660
Huh.

47:46.694 --> 47:47.861
The great frog.

47:47.895 --> 47:50.030
The great frog.

48:07.782 --> 48:10.750

49:35.916 --> 49:39.051
It's time.

49:39.085 --> 49:40.886
People of Earth,

49:40.921 --> 49:44.390
I speak to you again,
one last time.

49:44.424 --> 49:48.727
You have enjoyed decades
of peace and prosperity,

49:48.762 --> 49:50.830
a golden age for man.

49:53.366 --> 49:57.937
But the Sun sets on even
the most glorious of days,

49:57.971 --> 50:03.175
and it must now start to slowly
sink into the night for you.

50:03.210 --> 50:05.244
Do not condemn us,

50:05.278 --> 50:08.080
for we were tasked
by a higher mind

50:08.114 --> 50:09.849
<i>to oversee your evolution</i>

50:09.883 --> 50:13.319
<i>to a higher level</i>
<i>of consciousness.</i>

50:13.353 --> 50:17.556
<i>It is your destiny</i>
<i>and the destiny of many worlds.</i>

50:18.658 --> 50:22.695
You have grown accustomed
to our presence,

50:22.729 --> 50:25.130
but we can be your guardians
no more.

50:25.165 --> 50:26.499
Thomas, sit down.

50:26.533 --> 50:29.902
Your children
are no longer yours.

50:31.471 --> 50:34.907
<i>In time,</i>
<i>they will cease to be human.</i>

50:34.941 --> 50:37.977
No more children
will be born on Earth.

50:38.011 --> 50:40.713
<i>No more children</i>
<i>will be born on Earth.</i>

50:40.747 --> 50:44.650
<i>No more children will be</i>
<i>born on Earth, ever again.</i>

50:44.684 --> 50:48.487
<i>For the adults,</i>
<i>your future is yours</i>

50:48.522 --> 50:54.059
<i>to live as you see please</i>
<i>for however many days are left.</i>

50:54.094 --> 50:59.098
<i>My hope is that humanity</i>
<i>will go to its rest in peace.</i>

51:09.935 --> 51:11.302
My baby!

51:16.141 --> 51:17.241
- No, Jennifer.
- Jen.

51:17.275 --> 51:18.742
Jen, no.

51:18.777 --> 51:19.743
- Jen!
- Jen!

51:19.778 --> 51:20.878
- No, Jen.
- No, Jen.

51:20.912 --> 51:22.713
Jen, get down!
Jen!

51:22.747 --> 51:25.416
Pasquale.

51:25.450 --> 51:26.750
Jennifer.

51:32.457 --> 51:35.359
No!
No, Jennifer!

51:35.393 --> 51:37.027
- Honey.
- This is not gonna happen.

51:37.062 --> 51:38.762
Jenny, no. No.

51:55.547 --> 51:57.648
Gracie!

52:00.151 --> 52:03.320
John!

52:04.823 --> 52:05.889
He's gone.

52:31.449 --> 52:34.885
Don't leave, please.
No.

52:34.919 --> 52:36.887
Tom, don't leave me, buddy.

52:36.921 --> 52:39.890
Please.

52:39.924 --> 52:40.958
Tom.

52:40.992 --> 52:42.593
Please, don't.

52:42.627 --> 52:44.962
Come here, come here.

53:01.212 --> 53:03.580
Jerry!

53:03.615 --> 53:06.050
Jerry.

53:06.084 --> 53:07.051
Jerry!

53:09.320 --> 53:12.890
Amy.

53:12.924 --> 53:15.359
Oh!

53:15.393 --> 53:16.927
Okay, okay.

53:20.498 --> 53:22.800
No.
He's taken it.

53:26.771 --> 53:28.572
Mom.

53:34.345 --> 53:36.146
Jake.

54:10.978 --> 54:14.213
We were a greedy people,

54:14.248 --> 54:16.482
selfish.

54:16.517 --> 54:19.886
We screwed up in a big way,

54:19.920 --> 54:22.055
but we made music.

54:22.089 --> 54:23.089
We wrote books.

54:23.123 --> 54:25.124
We mapped the cosmos.

54:25.159 --> 54:26.392
That's right, Jerry.

54:26.427 --> 54:27.927
We're amazing.

54:27.962 --> 54:29.262
We're an amazing race,

54:29.296 --> 54:33.733
so let's carry on being amazing.

54:35.669 --> 54:40.006
Let's defy the Overlords
and get our kids back.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.607
It's not gonna end.

54:41.642 --> 54:44.877
We do not end,
but we can't give up hope.

54:44.912 --> 54:47.747
There was hope,

54:47.781 --> 54:49.816
the hope we had
since the beginning of mankind,

54:49.850 --> 54:53.886
the only hope there ever was,

54:53.921 --> 54:56.322
the children, Jake.

54:56.357 --> 54:59.459
The children.

54:59.493 --> 55:03.696
And they're gone now.

55:03.731 --> 55:06.065
Maybe when we die,

55:06.100 --> 55:08.267
we'll get a chance
to be with them again.

55:08.302 --> 55:10.069
Jerry,

55:10.104 --> 55:12.071
you built something here.

55:12.106 --> 55:14.907
All this is in defiance of them,
right?

55:14.942 --> 55:16.776
This is writing the book
ourselves,

55:16.810 --> 55:19.412
so don't let them
decide the ending.

55:19.446 --> 55:20.613
Jerry.

55:24.852 --> 55:26.652
You know, I was thinking.

55:26.687 --> 55:28.755
We're energy, right?

55:28.789 --> 55:32.492
<i>Human beings are energy.</i>

55:32.526 --> 55:33.693
<i>When our bodies are gone,</i>

55:33.727 --> 55:36.562
<i>that energy has to go somewhere.</i>

55:46.740 --> 55:47.740
Hey.

55:49.777 --> 55:52.445
You're fading.

55:52.479 --> 55:53.646
What?

55:53.680 --> 55:55.148
You're fading.

55:59.720 --> 56:01.988
She gave me some more time
to say good-bye, Mom,

56:02.022 --> 56:03.322
but it's over now,

56:03.357 --> 56:05.091
and I'm going.

56:05.125 --> 56:07.226
You know what human beings are?

56:07.261 --> 56:10.129
Martin Luther King,
Nelson Mandela.

56:10.164 --> 56:11.831
They keep fighting.

56:11.865 --> 56:13.466
We'll fight
to find our children,

56:13.500 --> 56:16.869
and we'll fight
to bring them back.

56:16.904 --> 56:18.571
Turn it off.
Turn it off.

56:18.605 --> 56:20.506
- Don't be absurd!
- Turn it off!

56:20.541 --> 56:21.507
You saw it.

56:21.542 --> 56:23.309
You saw it in their eyes.

56:23.343 --> 56:24.610
They're beyond us now.

56:24.645 --> 56:25.711
Turn it off.

56:28.082 --> 56:29.082
Turn it off.

56:30.451 --> 56:34.554
Ask Jennifer
if you can stay here with us.

56:39.359 --> 56:42.095
You belong with us.

56:42.129 --> 56:44.030
Mom, it's all right.

56:44.064 --> 56:46.532
I'm joining the others.

56:46.567 --> 56:48.835
I have to go now.

56:48.869 --> 56:51.137
She's calling me.

56:51.171 --> 56:52.572
I have to go.

57:24.037 --> 57:25.805
You can't destroy this place.

57:25.839 --> 57:27.540
What does it matter
what we want, Jake?

57:31.478 --> 57:32.845
We're little men.

57:33.914 --> 57:35.381
We're little men.

57:35.415 --> 57:37.216
Just stop.

57:42.956 --> 57:44.690
I was a little girl,

57:44.725 --> 57:48.628
alone in a hospital bed,

57:48.662 --> 57:51.330
and I was scared.

57:51.365 --> 57:52.365
Remember?

57:56.170 --> 58:00.640
And then I looked
into your eyes,

58:00.674 --> 58:02.909
and I wasn't scared anymore.

58:11.151 --> 58:13.085
Hey, hey.

58:13.120 --> 58:16.455
At least we knew love.

58:20.093 --> 58:25.765
At least we knew what it was
to be a family.

58:25.799 --> 58:29.202
Okay, okay.

58:29.236 --> 58:31.837
Okay, okay, I'm here.

58:31.872 --> 58:32.838
I'm here.

58:37.611 --> 58:39.078
I love you.

58:39.112 --> 58:41.180
I love you.

01:01:01.773 --> 01:01:05.076
I am is Vindarten.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:07.011
This be--

01:01:07.045 --> 01:01:09.413
This can be--

01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:12.016
No.

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:13.651
This language is--

01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:17.555
I'm new this language
but is fine and under control.

01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:21.359
Is fine and good.

01:01:21.393 --> 01:01:24.231
You are not well.

01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:29.308
Hence the floor.

01:01:31.439 --> 01:01:35.208
We use your terms,
and so in your terms,

01:01:35.242 --> 01:01:39.045
we are 11 and 100 years
of light away from Earth.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.582
We are orbit the sixth planet
in the Carina System.

01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:47.954
This is our world.

01:01:47.988 --> 01:01:51.124
You call home world.

01:01:51.158 --> 01:01:53.526
We can call it Jenjedda.

01:01:57.498 --> 01:01:59.799
I made it.

01:01:59.834 --> 01:02:02.168
Indeed.

01:02:02.203 --> 01:02:04.370
How long has it been?

01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:07.173
It be 40 of your Earth years.

01:02:24.325 --> 01:02:27.560
So you say it's been 40 years
on Earth, right?

01:02:27.595 --> 01:02:28.828
What's it like there now?

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.400
Interesting.

01:02:34.435 --> 01:02:37.103
You come this all way
here to ask for back

01:02:37.138 --> 01:02:38.238
where you come out from.

01:02:38.272 --> 01:02:40.306
Look, I came here
because I saw it.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:43.109
The Earth is in danger.

01:02:43.144 --> 01:02:47.080
Everything that is happen
on Earth was planned long ago.

01:02:47.114 --> 01:02:50.817
Is natural, is the cosmos,

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:53.019
is the Overmind.

01:02:53.053 --> 01:02:55.121
Overmind?

01:02:55.156 --> 01:02:59.526
Overmind of all Creation.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.495
Are you talking about God?

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:07.634
We have talked to the Overmind
for 100,000 year.

01:03:07.668 --> 01:03:09.235
We go where it sends.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:12.539
We change worlds.

01:03:12.573 --> 01:03:15.441
We change Earth.

01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:18.711
The Overmind,

01:03:18.746 --> 01:03:21.714
can you show it to me?

01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:24.951
You really want this?

01:03:24.985 --> 01:03:26.786
I want to know everything.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.062
It connects to the Overmind.

01:04:41.362 --> 01:04:42.795
Step in.

01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:48.067
You're the Overmind.

01:04:48.102 --> 01:04:50.503
A faint reflection of it.

01:04:50.537 --> 01:04:52.639
I am all,

01:04:52.673 --> 01:04:56.075
divisible

01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:58.912
and indivisible.

01:04:58.946 --> 01:05:03.516
I am the collective
consciousness of this universe.

01:05:08.489 --> 01:05:11.090
So we are God?

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:13.993
No, the children are God,

01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:16.863
and they have left you,
as children must,

01:05:16.897 --> 01:05:19.966
and you must let them go,
as parents must.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.703
Only the children
can become a part of the whole.

01:05:23.737 --> 01:05:25.338
It's an evolution.

01:05:25.372 --> 01:05:27.307
Into one mind.

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:34.547
So we're finished?

01:05:34.581 --> 01:05:35.548
We cease to exist?

01:05:35.582 --> 01:05:36.616
We--

01:05:45.426 --> 01:05:46.659
Oh, my God.

01:06:00.507 --> 01:06:03.676
I have to get back to Rachel.

01:06:03.711 --> 01:06:06.179
I need to go back.

01:06:06.213 --> 01:06:07.480
Take me back home.

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:18.530
Hello, Milo.

01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:46.792
I trust you slept well.

01:06:46.826 --> 01:06:51.530
More comfortable than the squid,
I suspect.

01:06:51.564 --> 01:06:54.600
I'm home.

01:06:54.634 --> 01:06:57.836
It is not home anymore.

01:06:57.871 --> 01:06:59.771
Right.

01:06:59.806 --> 01:07:03.976
It's been 85 years.

01:07:05.278 --> 01:07:06.511
While you've been asleep,

01:07:06.546 --> 01:07:08.814
I have been
learning your language.

01:07:08.848 --> 01:07:10.983
"Oh, for a muse of fire
that would ascend

01:07:11.017 --> 01:07:13.185
the brightest heaven
of invention."

01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:17.489
William Shakespeare.

01:07:17.523 --> 01:07:19.291
What happened to the Orbital?

01:07:37.243 --> 01:07:39.845
It happened long ago.

01:07:39.879 --> 01:07:42.648
Rachel?

01:07:42.682 --> 01:07:45.584
We brought her here.

01:07:45.618 --> 01:07:49.288
Would you like to see her?

01:07:49.322 --> 01:07:51.123
Yes.

01:08:59.225 --> 01:09:04.496
You know a lot,
so I'm just gonna ask it.

01:09:05.665 --> 01:09:09.401
Does anything of her
survive beyond death?

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:14.339
Yes, you.

01:09:14.374 --> 01:09:16.908
It's not a consolation.

01:09:16.943 --> 01:09:22.147
Consciousness, Milo,
is a community of minds.

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:25.850
Each exists
in the other's thoughts.

01:09:25.885 --> 01:09:28.620
Rachel exists
in your consciousness

01:09:28.654 --> 01:09:33.558
as if she had never left.

01:09:33.593 --> 01:09:34.693
You still love her,

01:09:34.727 --> 01:09:38.095
you still feel her,
so what has changed?

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:43.801
She's dead, gone.

01:09:46.005 --> 01:09:49.341
But she once lived,
and you knew her.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:51.009
You know her still.

01:09:52.612 --> 01:09:54.446
Until I'm gone too, right?

01:10:11.464 --> 01:10:16.635
It's all gone, everything
we built, we did.

01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:19.771
It has been the destiny
of many worlds.

01:10:19.806 --> 01:10:23.608
We have overseen them all.

01:10:23.643 --> 01:10:26.478
Yeah, what about your people?

01:10:26.512 --> 01:10:31.950
Is this gonna happen to you
one day on Jenjedda?

01:10:31.984 --> 01:10:34.986
We have reached the end
of our development.

01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:37.422
All our possibilities
are exhausted.

01:10:40.026 --> 01:10:43.128
Oh, Milo.

01:10:43.162 --> 01:10:47.999
You were so flawed as a species
and so passionate.

01:10:48.034 --> 01:10:52.904
You believed in so much
and knew so little.

01:10:52.939 --> 01:10:56.141
I envy mankind.

01:10:56.175 --> 01:10:58.910
Your children can go
where we can never follow.

01:11:02.348 --> 01:11:04.950
I miss cookie dough ice cream.

01:11:07.353 --> 01:11:10.522
You ever have it?

01:11:10.556 --> 01:11:11.723
It's, like,

01:11:11.757 --> 01:11:13.024
the first time you try it,

01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:14.860
you're all like,

01:11:14.894 --> 01:11:16.161
"How have I lived so long

01:11:16.195 --> 01:11:20.132
without this in my life?"

01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:22.000
You ever come across
a civilization

01:11:22.034 --> 01:11:23.869
with cookie dough ice cream?

01:11:23.903 --> 01:11:26.404
No.

01:11:26.439 --> 01:11:29.875
We did that.

01:11:29.909 --> 01:11:31.409
Not bad.

01:11:41.387 --> 01:11:42.921
I'm the last one.

01:11:48.227 --> 01:11:51.329
You can stay here with us.

01:11:51.364 --> 01:11:53.632
The boy who wanted
to know everything

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:56.034
can know everything after all.

01:11:56.068 --> 01:11:57.068
Thank you.

01:11:59.238 --> 01:12:03.475
But I don't share your view,
Karellen.

01:12:03.509 --> 01:12:06.378
She's dead,

01:12:06.412 --> 01:12:11.483
and I can't bear to live out
my life as the last man.

01:12:11.517 --> 01:12:15.520
My place is out there,
someone to witness this.

01:12:22.161 --> 01:12:24.329
If I went back to the Earth,

01:12:24.363 --> 01:12:28.066
I could report back
what happens on the ground.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.334
Has anybody ever done that?

01:12:29.368 --> 01:12:32.170
You would do that for me?

01:12:32.205 --> 01:12:33.438
Of course.

01:12:33.472 --> 01:12:35.140
I'm a scientist.

01:13:01.767 --> 01:13:05.170
My name was Milo Rodricks,

01:13:05.204 --> 01:13:09.507
not that it matters anymore.

01:13:09.542 --> 01:13:14.346
I'm--I was an astrophysicist.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.147
I've lived more than a lifetime,

01:13:16.182 --> 01:13:18.583
and--

01:13:18.618 --> 01:13:23.622
and I can smell Pop-Tarts.

01:13:23.656 --> 01:13:26.091
I'm the last human being,

01:13:26.125 --> 01:13:28.994
enjoying his last
sensory pleasure.

01:13:36.936 --> 01:13:39.904
<i>I got a favor to ask.</i>

01:13:39.939 --> 01:13:42.774
<i>Don't forget us.</i>

01:13:42.808 --> 01:13:44.109
<i>We may have many faults,</i>

01:13:44.143 --> 01:13:46.478
<i>but we don't deserve</i>
<i>to be forgotten.</i>

01:13:57.590 --> 01:13:59.758
Strike my first statement.

01:13:59.792 --> 01:14:03.295
My name is Milo Rodricks,

01:14:03.329 --> 01:14:06.731
until the very last second,

01:14:06.766 --> 01:14:08.566
until the end.

01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:36.061
Jennifer is--

01:14:36.095 --> 01:14:41.232
she's drawing energy
from everywhere.

01:14:41.267 --> 01:14:44.536
The Moon,

01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:48.673
the ground beneath me
is disappearing.

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:50.308
She's taking everything.

01:14:55.781 --> 01:14:56.781
Oh, God.

01:14:56.816 --> 01:14:59.284
Jennifer, you're the last child.

01:15:06.492 --> 01:15:10.161
It's gonna end.

01:15:14.166 --> 01:15:16.835
Karellen, I'm scared.

01:15:19.635 --> 01:15:22.414
<i>Focus on me, Milo.</i>

01:15:22.534 --> 01:15:24.943
Hear my voice.

01:15:24.977 --> 01:15:26.711
Don't be afraid.
It's natural.

01:15:26.746 --> 01:15:28.747
You have nothing to fear.

01:15:31.183 --> 01:15:34.319
There's not much time.

01:15:34.353 --> 01:15:36.221
You have to save something!

01:15:36.255 --> 01:15:37.622
Save something from the Earth!

01:15:37.656 --> 01:15:38.990
We can't lose it all,

01:15:39.024 --> 01:15:41.159
you have to save one thing
please!

01:15:41.193 --> 01:15:42.694
What?

01:15:42.728 --> 01:15:44.429
<i>Something from our culture.</i>

01:15:44.463 --> 01:15:47.265
Look, it can't be this whole
mankind never existed at all.

01:15:47.299 --> 01:15:48.299
<i>Please.</i>

01:15:52.872 --> 01:15:54.706
<i>Please.</i>

01:16:49.995 --> 01:16:51.296
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:17:47.219 --> 01:17:49.053
It is done.

01:18:09.775 --> 01:18:12.577
<i>What do we do with it?</i>

01:18:12.611 --> 01:18:14.846
<i>Leave it here</i>

01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:17.682
<i>for whoever passes through,</i>

01:18:17.716 --> 01:18:19.584
<i>so they can hear it.</i>
