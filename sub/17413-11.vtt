WEBVTT

00:04.836 --> 00:05.836
Hey, Ally.

00:05.870 --> 00:07.404
Hey, Dez.

00:07.439 --> 00:08.505
Where's Austin?

00:08.540 --> 00:10.507
He and Trish aren't back
from their meeting yet.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.810
Oh, so it's just the
two of us, huh?

00:12.844 --> 00:14.511
Yup.

00:18.516 --> 00:20.818
A little Dez and Ally time.

00:22.654 --> 00:24.488
Yup.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.571
Did they mention when
they were gonna get back?

00:30.595 --> 00:33.430
Not that it matters 'cause
we're having so much fun.

00:33.465 --> 00:36.600
So much fun!

00:36.635 --> 00:38.869
But like five minutes?

00:40.538 --> 00:42.906
- Or more like an hour?
- Oh.

00:42.941 --> 00:43.907
- Hey, guys.
- What's up?

00:43.942 --> 00:46.910
Austin, don't ever leave
me alone with her again.

00:46.945 --> 00:49.913
I was trying to make small talk, but
the girl was giving me nothing.

00:51.650 --> 00:55.452
Uh, the girl can hear you.

00:55.487 --> 00:57.855
Anyway, I've got great news.

00:57.889 --> 01:01.759
Guess who got Austin a part in
the new Spike Stevens movie.

01:01.793 --> 01:03.794
- What?!
- No way!

01:03.828 --> 01:05.796
Spike Stevens is my
favorite director.

01:05.830 --> 01:07.798
He's the reason I got
into filmmaking.

01:07.832 --> 01:10.868
Before that, I just wanted
to be a brain surgeon.

01:10.902 --> 01:13.437
I think you made
the right choice.

01:13.471 --> 01:15.506
I have a surprise
for you too, Dez.

01:15.540 --> 01:18.809
Spike Stevens wants you
to work on his movie too.

01:18.843 --> 01:21.612
He's hiring you to
be his assistant.

01:21.646 --> 01:24.481
Really? What did you show
him that I directed?

01:24.516 --> 01:25.716
One of my music videos?

01:25.750 --> 01:29.520
Dun dun dun"?

01:29.554 --> 01:31.789
- Well, not exactly...
- Aww, it doesn't matter.

01:31.823 --> 01:35.859
The point is is that my hero recognized
my talent and wants to mentor me.

01:35.894 --> 01:38.562
I got you a job on
the movie too, Ally.

01:38.596 --> 01:40.698
Spike wants you to
write the theme song.

01:40.732 --> 01:42.700
No way!

01:42.734 --> 01:44.735
I have always wanted to
write songs for movies.

01:44.769 --> 01:46.603
Thanks, Trish.

01:46.638 --> 01:47.871
So what's the movie about?

01:47.906 --> 01:52.509
Huh, I probably should have asked that
before we agreed to do the movie.

01:53.745 --> 01:55.846
Oh, well, we'll find
out soon enough.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.582
They start shooting at
the beach club tomorrow.

01:58.616 --> 01:59.717
I hope it's a musical.

01:59.751 --> 02:02.386
I've always wanted to
be in a beach musical.

02:03.755 --> 02:05.589
What are you gonna be?

02:05.623 --> 02:07.424
Some kind of singing surfer?

02:09.561 --> 02:10.627
I don't see it.

03:07.585 --> 03:08.852
This is awesome.

03:08.887 --> 03:11.755
I can't believe I actually have
a job on a Spike Stevens movie.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.424
I'm gonna go talk to the d.P.

03:13.458 --> 03:15.459
That's the "director
of photography"

03:15.493 --> 03:16.560
for you amateurs.

03:16.594 --> 03:18.562
Then I'm gonna talk
to the makeup girl.

03:18.596 --> 03:20.531
That's the girl who
does the makeup.

03:20.565 --> 03:22.666
You guys have so much to learn.

03:24.636 --> 03:25.702
You gonna tell him?

03:25.737 --> 03:26.837
Tell him what?

03:26.871 --> 03:30.441
Spike Stevens never saw
anything Dez directed.

03:30.475 --> 03:32.843
He just hired him 'cause
Dez is my friend.

03:32.877 --> 03:35.813
What? If Dez finds out,
it'll break his heart.

03:35.847 --> 03:39.516
You should get hired for
your talent like I was.

03:39.551 --> 03:40.517
Wait.

03:40.552 --> 03:42.853
Why did Spike hire me?

03:42.887 --> 03:47.424
<i>Because he loves
your songwriting.</i>

03:47.459 --> 03:49.460
Actually, he really does.

03:49.494 --> 03:51.528
I don't know why I
said it that way.

03:51.563 --> 03:54.498
You have to say
something to Dez.

03:54.532 --> 03:57.534
Well, makeup girl
was kinda rude.

03:57.569 --> 03:58.913
She wouldn't take any
of my directions.

03:58.937 --> 04:03.740
Well, she obviously doesn't know how
much Spike Stevens values your work.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.445
Mr. Stevens, I'm so excited...

04:08.480 --> 04:09.780
wait! Don't move.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.682
<i>The light is hitting
you perfectly.</i>

04:11.716 --> 04:14.485
Head up, shoulders back.

04:14.519 --> 04:15.786
You're intrigued, bewildered.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.422
You gasp!

04:18.456 --> 04:20.423
And cut.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.625
Welcome to my set, Austin.

04:22.861 --> 04:27.464
I see there's someone here I haven't
met whose work I admire very much!

04:27.499 --> 04:28.776
Spike, please, you're
embarrassing...

04:28.800 --> 04:31.435
Ally Dawson.

04:31.469 --> 04:33.570
I want to talk to you
about that theme song.

04:33.605 --> 04:37.574
I'm thinking it should
be subtle, yet bold.

04:37.609 --> 04:39.643
Loud, yet quiet.

04:39.677 --> 04:42.880
Whimsical, yet not whimsical.

04:42.914 --> 04:44.615
Do you understand what I mean?

04:44.649 --> 04:45.883
I do...

04:45.917 --> 04:46.917
But I do not.

04:48.553 --> 04:50.587
So what's the movie about?

04:50.622 --> 04:54.825
A Navy fighter pilot who
crash-lands on a tropical beach

04:54.859 --> 04:58.662
and falls in love with
a beautiful mermaid.

04:58.696 --> 05:01.598
I get to play a mermaid?!

05:01.633 --> 05:04.434
No, you're the fighter pilot.

05:04.469 --> 05:07.604
Oh, that's cool too.

05:07.639 --> 05:10.674
It's called "the pilot
and the mermaid."

05:10.708 --> 05:15.846
Based on the book, "the
mermaid and the pilot."

05:15.880 --> 05:19.850
Mr. Stevens, I just wanted to say what
an honor it is to be working with you.

05:19.884 --> 05:21.652
Who in the world are you?

05:21.686 --> 05:23.854
Uh, this is Dez.

05:23.888 --> 05:25.822
Remember? You said
how excited you were

05:25.857 --> 05:27.591
that he'd be working
as your assistant.

05:27.625 --> 05:30.427
If it wasn't for you, Dez
would be a brain surgeon.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.797
So on behalf of everybody in the
world with a brain, thank you.

05:33.831 --> 05:35.832
So what do you want
me to do first?

05:35.867 --> 05:38.869
Run lines with the actors, go over
the shots, help with the lighting?

05:38.903 --> 05:42.472
Just get me some coffee.
Deca okay, then what?

05:42.507 --> 05:46.843
Put a hint of cream in it and
deliver it back to me, pronto.

05:46.878 --> 05:49.746
Austin, let me introduce
you to your co-star.

05:49.781 --> 05:51.815
- Who is she?
- Is she super famous?

05:51.849 --> 05:53.617
Have I seen her movies?
Wait, don't tell me.

05:53.651 --> 05:54.751
Okay, tell me!

05:54.786 --> 05:57.621
Brandy Braxton.

05:57.655 --> 05:59.756
No way! I love her!

05:59.791 --> 06:01.558
Her work in "the
duchess diaries"

06:01.593 --> 06:03.393
really inspired me.

06:03.428 --> 06:04.605
Oh, you want to be
an actress too?

06:04.629 --> 06:06.396
No, I want to be a duchess.

06:06.431 --> 06:08.632
I look good in tiaras.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.601
Is Brandy really
sweet in person,

06:10.635 --> 06:12.636
like she is on screen?

06:12.670 --> 06:14.838
<i>Ugh!</i>

06:14.872 --> 06:18.709
You are worthless!

06:18.743 --> 06:20.410
I guess not.

06:20.445 --> 06:24.581
Brandy Braxton doesn't eat
sandwiches with tomatoes!

06:26.618 --> 06:29.586
I want a new sandwich now!

06:29.621 --> 06:31.688
Ugh! Ugh!

06:31.723 --> 06:33.490
Aww.

06:39.631 --> 06:42.733
Rebecca Brandon, costumer.

06:42.767 --> 06:46.403
Cheryl vanderflink,
mermaid expert.

06:46.437 --> 06:47.671
What are you doing?

06:47.705 --> 06:49.573
Labeling scripts for Spike.

06:49.607 --> 06:51.608
I thought he'd teach me how
to be a real director.

06:51.643 --> 06:54.444
Instead it's like I'm
just some unpaid intern.

06:54.479 --> 06:56.513
Look, that's what it
says on the label.

06:56.547 --> 06:59.616
Just some unpaid intern."

06:59.651 --> 07:01.618
Uh, that's not a bad thing.

07:01.653 --> 07:04.488
All directors start out
as unpaid interns.

07:04.522 --> 07:07.824
Do all directors just clean up messes,
get coffee, and sharpen pencils?

07:07.859 --> 07:10.460
'Cause that's all Spike's
been having me do today.

07:10.495 --> 07:13.730
I bet there's a smart reason why
he's having you do all that.

07:13.765 --> 07:15.699
Right, Ally?

07:17.835 --> 07:20.504
Uh, yeah.

07:20.538 --> 07:26.510
You sharpen pencils because...
A director has to stay sharp.

07:26.544 --> 07:28.378
Seriously, Ally?

07:29.480 --> 07:31.581
'Cause that is brilliant!

07:31.616 --> 07:33.417
Spike's a genius.

07:35.553 --> 07:38.388
- Hi, Brandy, I'm...
- Don't talk to me.

07:38.423 --> 07:41.658
I only care about my co-stars.

07:42.860 --> 07:44.695
Uh, hi, Brandy.

07:44.729 --> 07:46.563
- I'm your co-star.
- Don't talk to me either.

07:46.597 --> 07:48.465
I don't really care
about my co-stars.

07:48.499 --> 07:50.467
I do have a few rules.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.736
One, don't stand in front of me.

07:52.770 --> 07:55.472
Two, don't look me in the eye.

07:55.506 --> 07:57.407
And three, don't ever touch me.

07:57.442 --> 07:59.743
All right, Austin, I need you
to stand in front of Brandy,

07:59.777 --> 08:01.712
look her in the eye, and
carry her to safety.

08:01.746 --> 08:04.381
Okay, places!

08:04.415 --> 08:07.350
This is the first
shot of the movie!

08:10.722 --> 08:12.789
And action!

08:20.724 --> 08:22.492
Cut!

08:23.761 --> 08:25.461
Austin!

08:25.496 --> 08:27.830
I need you to carry the
mermaid to safety.

08:27.865 --> 08:28.831
She's scared.

08:28.866 --> 08:31.400
I'm scared.

08:31.435 --> 08:32.635
Brandy said not to touch her.

08:32.669 --> 08:35.438
What?! I did not.

08:36.707 --> 08:38.741
I can't work like this.

08:38.775 --> 08:41.409
I demand a new co-star now.

08:41.445 --> 08:43.546
Spike, how do you work with her?

08:43.580 --> 08:44.647
She's a little cray-cray.

08:44.681 --> 08:47.517
I know, but she's also talented.

08:47.551 --> 08:49.852
Luckily, I know how
to control her.

08:49.887 --> 08:53.790
He's gonna show her no one acts like
a baby on Spike's Stevens' set.

08:53.824 --> 08:57.760
Do you want your banky?

08:57.795 --> 09:01.564
And your bear-bear?

09:03.667 --> 09:06.369
Yup, he sure showed her.

09:06.403 --> 09:09.472
Oh, I wuv my bear-bear.

09:09.506 --> 09:11.607
Are you ready to
shoot this scene?

09:11.642 --> 09:13.476
I'm weady.

09:13.510 --> 09:16.512
But you have to ask
beaw-beaw if he's weady.

09:17.781 --> 09:20.750
This is wee-diculous.

09:20.784 --> 09:23.653
Bear-bear, are you weady
to shoot this scene?

09:25.556 --> 09:28.357
No, bear-bear's thirsty.

09:28.392 --> 09:30.626
Dez, I need you to do
something important!

09:30.661 --> 09:33.763
Finally, two great directors
working to make movie magic.

09:33.797 --> 09:35.598
Get this bear a smoothie.

09:35.632 --> 09:38.401
What does this have
to do with directing?

09:38.435 --> 09:41.671
So you can learn how to
direct more smoothie-ly.

09:41.705 --> 09:45.441
When are you gonna teach me
how to be real director?

09:45.475 --> 09:47.510
You saw my movie. You
know I'm talented.

09:47.544 --> 09:49.846
Movie? I didn't see your movie.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.583
Oh, but I thought Austin said...

09:53.617 --> 09:55.451
Wait, if you didn't
see my movie,

09:55.485 --> 09:56.686
why did you hire me?

09:56.720 --> 09:58.688
Because you're Austin's friend.

09:58.722 --> 10:00.790
And I need to keep
my stars happy.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:18.013 --> 10:19.814
Dez...

10:19.848 --> 10:20.948
I'm sorry.

10:20.982 --> 10:22.983
Me and bear-bear
aren't talking to you.

10:24.719 --> 10:26.620
What's that, bear-bear?

10:26.655 --> 10:29.824
You're right. Austin is
a jerk for lying to me.

10:35.063 --> 10:38.699
I never said Spike
watched your stuff.

10:38.733 --> 10:40.568
You just thought he did.

10:40.602 --> 10:42.870
I didn't have the heart
to tell you the truth.

10:45.974 --> 10:48.943
I just really thought he hired
me because of my talent.

10:48.977 --> 10:52.746
Hey, it doesn't matter
how you got the job.

10:52.781 --> 10:55.816
Working with Spike is still
a great opportunity.

10:55.851 --> 10:57.618
You should make the most of it.

10:57.652 --> 10:58.986
You're right.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.989
I'm gonna prove to Spike
that I am a great director.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.525
That I'm above all
these degrading tasks.

11:06.695 --> 11:08.973
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have
to put a diaper on bear-bear

11:08.997 --> 11:10.664
before he makes a poo-poo.

11:18.807 --> 11:19.807
Okay, Spike.

11:19.841 --> 11:23.544
I fed Brandy's bear and I have some
ideas about how to shoot this scene.

11:23.578 --> 11:24.845
I'll take the bear.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.547
You keep the ideas.

11:26.581 --> 11:29.917
Hey, he likes what you
did with the bear.

11:29.951 --> 11:30.951
Things are looking up.

11:32.020 --> 11:35.556
Spike, I just finished
the theme song.

11:35.590 --> 11:36.801
I can't wait for you to hear it.

11:36.825 --> 11:38.959
Well, that was a waste of time.

11:38.994 --> 11:40.794
You need to start over.

11:40.829 --> 11:42.963
What do you mean?

11:42.998 --> 11:45.599
I have my own ideas
about the song.

11:45.634 --> 11:49.870
I want it to be a duet written from
the point of view of the mermaid

11:49.905 --> 11:54.909
and rhyme something with
the word "aquarium."

11:54.943 --> 11:57.745
Why not make it in Spanish
while you're at it?

11:57.779 --> 11:59.847
Good idea. Make it in Spanish.

11:59.881 --> 12:02.883
But that's not
what Spike wanted.

12:02.918 --> 12:04.618
Tell her.

12:04.653 --> 12:07.555
We've all got to do stuff we
don't want to keep her happy.

12:07.589 --> 12:10.591
My wife's having a baby in two weeks
and we have to name it Brandy.

12:10.625 --> 12:12.726
And it's a boy.

12:12.761 --> 12:16.697
Fine, I'll write the
song the way she wants.

12:16.731 --> 12:18.632
I can rhyme "aquarium."

12:18.667 --> 12:20.801
If you need me, I'll
be over there-ium.

12:20.835 --> 12:23.637
See, I'm already doing it.

12:25.040 --> 12:28.676
Can you believe her attitude?

12:28.710 --> 12:31.879
I don't get any
respect on this set.

12:31.913 --> 12:37.751
And on top of that, my manager just
quit on me for some mysterious reason.

12:37.786 --> 12:39.853
It's not much of a mystery.

12:41.856 --> 12:44.858
I'll be your new manager.

12:48.897 --> 12:50.898
Bear-bear!

12:53.001 --> 12:57.605
If I don't get a new
manager, I'm going to quit.

12:57.639 --> 13:00.975
Um, Trish will be
your new manager.

13:01.009 --> 13:02.943
I don't want to get
my head ripped off.

13:02.978 --> 13:04.645
Do it for me.

13:04.679 --> 13:05.957
Spike will see that
I'm solving problems.

13:05.981 --> 13:08.549
That's what good directors do.

13:08.583 --> 13:11.685
Fine, but I am not
doing anything weird.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.654
Who wants a yogurt?

13:13.688 --> 13:15.723
Brandy wants a yogurt.

13:18.727 --> 13:20.761
I don't like blueberry.

13:20.795 --> 13:21.996
What?

13:31.873 --> 13:33.707
This is useless.

13:33.742 --> 13:34.852
It doesn't matter what I do.

13:34.876 --> 13:36.677
Spike's never gonna
see me as a director.

13:36.711 --> 13:38.612
Don't give up yet, Dez.

13:38.647 --> 13:40.848
You never know when
destiny's going to call.

13:40.882 --> 13:43.784
Spike, your wife
destiny is calling!

13:44.886 --> 13:45.919
She's going into labor.

13:45.954 --> 13:48.555
You have to go to the
hospital right now.

13:48.590 --> 13:49.790
What?!

13:49.824 --> 13:51.659
She's two weeks early.

13:51.693 --> 13:53.027
I can't leave now.

13:53.061 --> 13:55.996
If we don't shoot this scene today,
the studio will shut us down.

13:56.031 --> 13:57.998
Dez, this is your chance.

13:59.901 --> 14:02.503
I'll shoot it for you.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.905
Listen to him. He's a
really good director.

14:04.939 --> 14:06.974
Yeah, he directs all
my music videos.

14:07.008 --> 14:08.575
What do you have to lose?

14:08.610 --> 14:10.544
Let me prove to you that
I got what it takes.

14:10.578 --> 14:12.980
I guess I have no choice.

14:13.014 --> 14:15.783
Don't mess this up, Dez.

14:15.817 --> 14:17.985
We're counting on you.

14:19.821 --> 14:22.690
Destiny!

14:22.724 --> 14:24.958
Yes! This is my big break.

14:24.993 --> 14:27.861
Okay, Brandy, let's shoot this.

14:27.896 --> 14:29.697
I want Spike.

14:29.731 --> 14:31.732
I'm not listening to you.

14:31.766 --> 14:34.001
You're just some unpaid intern.

14:34.035 --> 14:35.836
Ah-la-la-la-la...

14:35.870 --> 14:37.738
- La-la-la-la...
- Oh, no, she's losing it.

14:37.772 --> 14:39.006
Somebody do something!

14:41.876 --> 14:43.877
Calm down, Brandy.

14:43.912 --> 14:46.647
Here's your juicy box.

14:46.681 --> 14:48.716
I don't want a juicy box.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.818
What do you think I am? A baby?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.754
Ehh.

14:55.056 --> 14:56.957
Oh!

14:56.991 --> 14:59.560
Okay, I've had it!

14:59.594 --> 15:02.930
I can't work with this
selfish brat anymore!

15:02.964 --> 15:05.866
No one talks to me like that!

15:06.935 --> 15:08.969
I'm quitting this movie!

15:09.003 --> 15:11.638
But if you quit,
there is no movie.

15:11.673 --> 15:14.875
We'll all be out of jobs and I'll
lose my one shot at being a director.

15:14.909 --> 15:17.945
Too bad. You can thank...

15:17.979 --> 15:19.713
Whatever her name is.

15:32.123 --> 15:34.724
Hey, buddy.

15:36.093 --> 15:37.861
What are you doing?

15:37.895 --> 15:42.699
Since I'm not gonna be a director,
I'm studying to be a brain surgeon.

15:44.101 --> 15:47.137
Don't you think that's
a little tough?

15:47.171 --> 15:49.706
Nah, it's not like
it's brain surgery.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.709
Wait.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.878
Are you okay?

15:56.781 --> 15:59.683
I just really wanted to prove to
Spike that I have what it takes.

15:59.717 --> 16:00.884
I guess I don't.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.887
Hey, don't give up, Dez.
You're too talented.

16:03.921 --> 16:07.991
I didn't want to give up, but what
choice did I have? Brandy quit.

16:08.025 --> 16:11.695
I bet if Trish
apologizes to Brandy,

16:11.729 --> 16:13.964
she'll want to come back
and finish the movie.

16:13.998 --> 16:16.800
Fine.

16:16.834 --> 16:18.735
I'll tell Brandy I'm sorry.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.736
- Oh.
- Yeah!

16:19.770 --> 16:21.972
I guess I am partly to
blame for some of this.

16:22.006 --> 16:23.039
Why?

16:23.074 --> 16:25.842
Because you lost your temper,
'causing Brandy to walk off the film,

16:25.876 --> 16:29.646
making it impossible for me to
shoot and destroying my dream?

16:29.680 --> 16:30.947
You're right.

16:30.982 --> 16:32.682
It's no one's fault.

16:42.093 --> 16:44.961
Hey, Brandy, thanks for coming.

16:44.996 --> 16:47.764
Trish has something she
wants to tell you.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.100
Before you do, I'd
just like to tell you

16:50.134 --> 16:53.003
that I don't respect you
as a manager or a person.

16:55.072 --> 16:57.807
You are not making this easy.

16:57.842 --> 17:01.978
Brandy, I'm sorry I called
you a selfish brat.

17:02.013 --> 17:07.817
I was just jealous because you are
so much better than me in every way.

17:07.852 --> 17:11.021
Thank you, Trish. I
accept your apology.

17:11.055 --> 17:13.022
But...

17:13.057 --> 17:15.925
I think you're forgetting
about someone else.

17:17.962 --> 17:19.061
Seriously?

17:20.798 --> 17:22.866
I'm sorry, bear-bear.

17:25.869 --> 17:27.103
He forgives you too.

17:27.137 --> 17:28.104
We're back in.

17:28.138 --> 17:30.073
- Oh, yeah! Oh!
- Yeah!

17:30.107 --> 17:31.875
Okay, Brandy.

17:31.909 --> 17:33.677
This is the final scene.

17:33.711 --> 17:36.746
Austin carries you to the water
and kisses you good-bye.

17:36.781 --> 17:40.784
He waves with his hand as
you wave with your tail.

17:40.818 --> 17:43.753
I don't like this ending.

17:43.788 --> 17:46.856
Why can't he swim off into the
sunset while I stay on the land?

17:46.891 --> 17:49.125
Yes! I get to be the mermaid!

17:51.028 --> 17:53.129
No, Brandy's the mermaid.

17:53.164 --> 17:55.765
I don't want to be the mermaid!

17:59.804 --> 18:02.806
I want my blanky. I
want my bear-bear.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.607
I want my yogurt.

18:04.642 --> 18:07.744
And I want a unicorn
that breathes fire!

18:07.778 --> 18:10.747
That is it, young lady!

18:10.781 --> 18:12.882
I've had enough of
your temper tantrums.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.918
Now you listen to me or
you're getting a timeout.

18:14.952 --> 18:17.787
You're the actress.
I'm the director.

18:17.822 --> 18:21.891
Now stop acting like a baby, get
on the beach, and be the mermaid!

18:21.926 --> 18:23.893
Have I made myself clear?!

18:26.030 --> 18:27.931
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

18:27.965 --> 18:29.999
I'll be good. I promise.

18:33.104 --> 18:35.071
Vance, calibrate
the camera lens.

18:35.106 --> 18:37.073
Rebecca, get her in the costume.

18:37.108 --> 18:39.943
Casey, we need more wind
on those palm trees.

18:39.977 --> 18:42.879
And, Austin, you stay handsome.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.821
Quiet on set!

18:51.856 --> 18:53.089
Slate!

18:54.992 --> 18:57.060
And action.

18:58.896 --> 19:04.033
Mermaid, I'll never love
anyone as much as I love you.

19:04.068 --> 19:05.835
Oh, pilot...

19:08.038 --> 19:10.774
I wish I could stay, but...

19:10.808 --> 19:14.844
I can only breathe oxygen
for 20 minutes at a time.

19:31.122 --> 19:32.856
And cut.

19:37.795 --> 19:39.730
Love it!

19:39.764 --> 19:42.733
Spike, what are you doing here?

19:42.767 --> 19:45.869
My wife wasn't really
going into labor.

19:45.903 --> 19:50.941
Yeah, we planned all that stuff just
so you would have a chance to direct.

19:50.975 --> 19:52.809
Wait, so you were
all in on this?

19:52.844 --> 19:55.812
Yeah, after you found out I only
hired you because of Austin,

19:55.847 --> 19:57.647
they begged me to
watch your films.

19:57.682 --> 19:59.783
They were good.

19:59.817 --> 20:03.687
After seeing what you did here today, I'm
sure you're going to be great at it.

20:03.721 --> 20:06.790
- Thanks, Spike.
- Way to go, buddy.

20:06.824 --> 20:10.060
- I knew you could do it.
- I'm proud of you, Dez.

20:10.094 --> 20:14.731
So does this mean I have to go back
to doing all those degrading tasks?

20:14.766 --> 20:17.033
Hey, all those "tasks"

20:17.068 --> 20:18.869
helped make you a
better director.

20:18.903 --> 20:21.671
Sharpened pencils helped
you make your shot list.

20:21.706 --> 20:23.784
Labeling those scripts helped
you learn the crew's names.

20:23.808 --> 20:28.711
Everything you did helped the
movie run more smoothie-ly.

20:28.746 --> 20:30.713
Ma.

20:30.748 --> 20:33.049
I was.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.951
Thanks for doing this, guys.

20:34.985 --> 20:36.886
I still can't believe
how you pulled it off.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.989
First, you made a famous director
pretend that his wife was in labor.

20:40.023 --> 20:43.059
Then, you made a famous actress pretend
that she was a whack-a-doodle. Ha!

20:43.093 --> 20:45.695
I love you, bear-bear.

20:45.729 --> 20:47.797
I wuv you mowe, bwandy.

20:47.831 --> 20:50.066
No, I love you more, bear-bear!

20:54.772 --> 20:57.940
Yeah, she's not pretending.

21:02.146 --> 21:05.948
Whew! Guys, I finished
editing the music video

21:05.983 --> 21:08.050
Spike let me direct
to promote the movie.

21:08.085 --> 21:10.086
I can't wait to
hear Ally's song.

21:10.120 --> 21:14.724
Just so you know, because of Brandy,
I had to translate it from English

21:14.758 --> 21:16.893
to Spanish and back to English.

21:16.927 --> 21:19.128
So the lyrics may
seem a little weird.
