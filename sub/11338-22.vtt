01:04.944 --> 01:07.330
This is Dorris archer,
she's the third woman to go missing

01:07.331 --> 01:08.948
In Boise, Idaho, this year,

01:08.949 --> 01:12.284
Along with Paula Renmar
and Samantha Rush.

01:12.285 --> 01:14.968
They went missing
roughly 2 months apart.

01:14.969 --> 01:17.433
Well, hello.

01:22.094 --> 01:24.430
What, did you join a boy band?

01:25.160 --> 01:26.298
No.

01:27.401 --> 01:29.297
Ok, so what are we
looking at here?

01:29.298 --> 01:31.337
Late 20s, early 30s.

01:31.338 --> 01:34.340
All single, though two are
in committed relationships.

01:34.341 --> 01:35.875
All living on their own.

01:35.876 --> 01:38.611
Looks like normal suburban houses.
Gives the unsub privacy.

01:38.612 --> 01:40.504
The differences are more
striking than the similarities.

01:40.505 --> 01:42.529
Different hair colors,
different body shapes.

01:42.530 --> 01:43.848
What do you know about his M.O.?

01:43.849 --> 01:45.231
That's why we were invited in.

01:45.232 --> 01:46.931
The abduction sites are pristine.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.433
And there's no DNA
besides the victims',

01:48.434 --> 01:50.520
And there's no sign of
forced entry or a struggle.

01:50.521 --> 01:51.868
And the victims aren't
reported missing

01:51.869 --> 01:54.314
Until 2 or 3 days after
they're abducted.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.707
2 or 3 days--

01:55.708 --> 01:57.900
Women like this don't just vanish

01:57.901 --> 01:59.444
Without somebody noticing.

01:59.445 --> 02:01.713
Yes. Which is why I asked Garcia

02:01.714 --> 02:03.348
To dig into their lives.

02:03.349 --> 02:05.683
And when I took a look
at their online activity,

02:05.684 --> 02:07.521
I could easily see how
the unsub is doing it.

02:07.522 --> 02:08.985
Social networking sites.

02:08.985 --> 02:10.372
Yeah. Facebook, Twitter.

02:10.372 --> 02:13.532
You name an online
life-sharing time suck,

02:13.533 --> 02:14.638
The victims were on it.

02:14.639 --> 02:16.194
And if you look at each
of their last posts,

02:16.195 --> 02:17.528
They say kind of the same thing--

02:17.529 --> 02:18.963
Going out of town,
going on a business trip,

02:18.964 --> 02:20.198
Going on a vacation.

02:20.199 --> 02:22.369
But when you look at
the time and date stamp

02:22.370 --> 02:24.652
Of each of these,
cue the "Twilight zone" Music,

02:24.653 --> 02:26.249
Because they were all posted

02:26.250 --> 02:28.542
the morning after each
of them went missing.

02:28.543 --> 02:29.621
The unsub posted them.

02:29.622 --> 02:31.093
Social networks are an easy way

02:31.094 --> 02:32.645
For an unsub to
target his victims.

02:32.646 --> 02:33.815
These women were especially open.

02:33.816 --> 02:35.985
They posted everything from
what they were having for dinner

02:35.986 --> 02:37.782
To where they were going on dates.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.751
So this unsub friends his victims

02:39.752 --> 02:41.987
And then uses that as a
cover once he takes them.

02:41.988 --> 02:43.658
That means he can hack
into their accounts.

02:43.659 --> 02:45.243
So he's excellent with computers.

02:45.244 --> 02:47.025
Definitely profiles as
patient and organized.

02:47.026 --> 02:49.481
He's obsessive enough to
remove all forensic details,

02:49.482 --> 02:52.096
But also patient enough to wait
2 months before abductions.

02:52.097 --> 02:53.285
He can afford to be.

02:53.286 --> 02:56.600
He gets 3 days to do whatever
he wants to these women.

02:56.601 --> 03:00.238
That means we need to assume
these women are already dead.

03:00.239 --> 03:02.933
The question is what he
does while he has them.

04:01.388 --> 04:03.428
"The single biggest
problem with communication

04:03.429 --> 04:05.649
Is the illusion that
it has taken place."

04:05.650 --> 04:07.617
George Bernard Shaw.

04:09.979 --> 04:12.147
So if this unsub is
using social networks

04:12.148 --> 04:14.565
To find his victims,
can't we use that to find him?

04:14.566 --> 04:17.860
Yeah, if these women each had
100 friends Following them,

04:17.861 --> 04:20.761
then the unsub would pop up
on each of their lists, right?

04:20.762 --> 04:22.924
Uh, the Detective in charge,
John Fordham,

04:22.925 --> 04:25.460
He looked into their groups.
Everyone checked out.

04:25.461 --> 04:28.497
Social networking sites
are surprisingly insecure.

04:28.498 --> 04:29.769
Facebook recently tried to update

04:29.770 --> 04:31.503
All their privacy settings,
and in doing so,

04:31.504 --> 04:33.644
They made everybody's
profiles viewable.

04:33.645 --> 04:38.105
Can somebody explain to me
the appeal of these sites?

04:38.106 --> 04:40.575
"Eating Sushi tonight. Yum."

04:40.576 --> 04:44.407
"Boss is keeping me
late at work. Grr."

04:44.408 --> 04:45.749
Whose life is so important

04:45.750 --> 04:48.313
That we'd be interested
in this kind of detail?

04:48.314 --> 04:50.234
I don't know. I guess that's
the running joke, right?

04:50.235 --> 04:53.054
I mean, nobody is.
But we'd all like to believe

04:53.055 --> 04:54.369
There's actually an
audience out there

04:54.370 --> 04:55.957
That wants to follow
our every move.

04:55.958 --> 04:58.659
You know, some sites actually
have a GPS feature built in.

04:58.660 --> 05:00.000
You can tell exactly
where someone is

05:00.001 --> 05:01.205
Every time they
post a new comment.

05:01.206 --> 05:02.685
This is telling us how
he's finding them,

05:02.686 --> 05:04.584
But it's not telling us how
he's getting into their houses.

05:04.585 --> 05:06.808
At the very least, I believe
that he has copies of their keys.

05:06.809 --> 05:09.171
Dorris archer had a home
security system installed,

05:09.172 --> 05:11.681
But the disable code was
entered at 1:56 A.M.

05:11.682 --> 05:12.808
So he knew that, too.

05:12.809 --> 05:14.654
He also found a way
to deal with her dog.

05:14.655 --> 05:16.522
A German Shepherd she adopted
from the pound last year

05:16.523 --> 05:18.534
Went missing the
night that she did.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.482
All right, so this guy's gotta
be in and out of the house

05:20.483 --> 05:22.717
Well before the night
of the disappearance.

05:22.718 --> 05:25.720
He comes up with some ruse,
talks his way inside,

05:25.721 --> 05:27.176
Then once he's familiar
enough with the house,

05:27.177 --> 05:28.623
He knows he can come
back and kidnap them

05:28.624 --> 05:30.437
Without disturbing anything.
What about the people

05:30.438 --> 05:33.317
who come into your house that
you don't consider a threat?

05:33.318 --> 05:35.516
Home repair guys, dog-walkers.

05:35.517 --> 05:37.414
Yeah, Detective Fordham
looked into that, too.

05:37.415 --> 05:39.741
No one even came close
to being a killer.

05:39.742 --> 05:42.410
Ok, Morgan and Prentiss,
start with the last abduction sites.

05:42.411 --> 05:44.102
See if anything point to his m.O.

05:44.103 --> 05:46.648
Dave, you, Reid, and JJ go
back over the women's lives.

05:46.649 --> 05:49.084
Start with their friends on
the social networking sites.

05:49.085 --> 05:50.745
If this is how the
unsub is finding them,

05:50.746 --> 05:53.482
Maybe they're connected to him
without even realizing it.

05:55.977 --> 05:58.760
Boise, Idaho

05:58.761 --> 06:00.132
Uh, Detective Fordham.

06:00.133 --> 06:00.837
Agent Jareau?

06:00.838 --> 06:03.376
Yeah. Uh, these are
SSA Hotcher, Rossi,

06:03.377 --> 06:05.126
And Dr. Spencer Reid.
How do you do?

06:05.127 --> 06:07.128
Well, thank you for coming.
We can really use your help.

06:07.129 --> 06:09.455
Did you find anyone willing to
talk to us about the victims?

06:09.456 --> 06:11.341
The problem wasn't
who to bring in.

06:11.342 --> 06:13.225
It was who not to.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.400
The man we're looking for

06:21.401 --> 06:24.303
Might have found your daughter
through her social networks.

06:24.304 --> 06:27.673
Did Paula mention
anyone new in her life?

06:27.674 --> 06:28.836
No.

06:28.837 --> 06:31.712
No one who started
following her as a friend,

06:31.713 --> 06:33.849
Someone she didn't recognize?

06:33.850 --> 06:36.382
I don't really know
how those work.

06:36.383 --> 06:38.050
Someone sent me an email

06:38.051 --> 06:41.287
Congratulating me on
Paula's promotion.

06:41.288 --> 06:43.647
I didn't even know.

06:43.648 --> 06:44.991
And when I asked her, she said,

06:44.992 --> 06:49.195
"Mom, I put that on
my wall last week."

06:49.196 --> 06:52.040
She was gone 2 days later.

06:54.245 --> 06:58.404
Samantha was rigorous about
keeping her status updated.

06:58.405 --> 07:00.339
She's obsessed with those sites.

07:00.340 --> 07:03.142
So I'm assuming she knew
who followed her, then?

07:03.143 --> 07:04.276
Oh, God, no.

07:04.277 --> 07:06.384
She had over 1,000 friends.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.759
Wow. Why so many?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.501
We both worked in real estate.

07:09.502 --> 07:12.165
She saw it as the perfect
way to promote herself.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.800
So, wait. Even though she
told all those people

07:13.801 --> 07:16.302
What she was doing, she didn't
know who was following her?

07:18.339 --> 07:20.006
You ever have so much email,

07:20.007 --> 07:21.708
You feeling like
you're drowning in it?

07:21.709 --> 07:23.977
Actually, I don't have email.

07:23.978 --> 07:25.612
Seriously?

07:27.261 --> 07:30.050
Then let me break it down for you.

07:30.051 --> 07:33.219
These websites are
like email on crack.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.055
It's impossible to
keep up with everybody.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.177
We just have a few more questions

07:39.178 --> 07:41.296
About your girlfriend's
disappearance.

07:41.297 --> 07:45.899
Did Dorris ever mention
letting someone in her home?

07:45.900 --> 07:47.700
Like who?

07:47.701 --> 07:49.302
Well, we're just
trying to figure out

07:49.303 --> 07:52.105
Who would know the code
to her home security.

07:52.106 --> 07:56.042
It must have been someone she
trusted with the combination.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.877
No. She was smart.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.847
She took precautions.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.325
That's the whole
reason she got Bruno.

08:03.326 --> 08:05.072
Bruno--the dog.
So he was a guard dog?

08:05.073 --> 08:08.321
Yeah. She trained him
for like 6 weeks.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.823
Ok.

08:11.792 --> 08:14.694
Um...I know these
are hard to look at,

08:14.695 --> 08:18.398
But do you see anything different?

08:18.399 --> 08:22.268
Something he may have done
to get himself inside.

08:32.046 --> 08:33.509
This isn't right.

08:33.510 --> 08:34.455
What's that?

08:34.456 --> 08:37.241
The photographs. This is
when we first started dating.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.419
The one on the right
should be on the left.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.678
Ok. And she wouldn't have
rearranged them herself?

08:41.679 --> 08:46.960
No. She arranged them a
certain way to tell a story.

08:47.995 --> 08:51.898
It was--it was how
we fell in love.

08:54.068 --> 08:55.467
Ok, JJ, I got it.

08:55.468 --> 08:56.934
You see it?

08:56.935 --> 08:58.671
Actually, yeah.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.699
Looks like he did try to
hang something on the wall.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.876
There's even a little
residue left over.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.310
Morgan.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.880
Let me call you back. Yeah.

09:06.881 --> 09:07.993
Yeah, what do you got?

09:07.994 --> 09:10.721
Hey, I got one up here, too.

09:10.722 --> 09:12.600
What would he try to hang
on that part of the wall?

09:12.601 --> 09:15.021
Well, from here,

09:15.022 --> 09:16.865
I have an unobstructed view

09:16.866 --> 09:19.657
Of the second floor
and down the stairs.

09:19.658 --> 09:21.227
It's the same thing down here.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.090
You can see the entire entrance.

09:23.091 --> 09:24.831
Cameras.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.866
He put up cameras.

10:01.655 --> 10:04.671
We think this is what he's
using to spy on his victims.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.873
They're small, they're cheap,
and they're easily hidden,

10:06.874 --> 10:08.230
Behind photos, books, or plants.

10:08.231 --> 10:09.741
The footage they record can then

10:09.742 --> 10:11.944
Be transmitted anywhere.
Website of your choice,

10:11.945 --> 10:12.845
Even your cell phone.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.884
And he can toggle between cameras

10:14.885 --> 10:16.678
To see everything that's
happening in the house.

10:16.679 --> 10:18.584
And you found 5 of these at
different points in the house?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.818
Upstairs, downstairs,
bedroom, even the bath.

10:20.819 --> 10:21.836
A ruse gets him in the door,

10:21.837 --> 10:23.980
But it doesn't buy him enough
time to put up 5 of these.

10:23.981 --> 10:25.857
Right. That's why we think
he starts with one camera

10:25.858 --> 10:27.191
Facing the front door.

10:27.192 --> 10:29.127
That tells him when it's
safe to enter the house,

10:29.128 --> 10:31.629
When she comes and goes,
when the dog-walker comes,

10:31.630 --> 10:33.184
And what the combination
to the house is.

10:33.185 --> 10:34.732
It fits his m.O.

10:34.733 --> 10:37.001
It he learned their every
detail on social networks,

10:37.002 --> 10:39.337
He will be just as obsessive
in his surveillance.

10:39.338 --> 10:40.905
And once he learns their routine,
all he has to do

10:40.906 --> 10:42.982
Is pick the lock, put up the
rest of the cameras, And boom,

10:42.983 --> 10:45.264
he got their whole
life at his fingertips.

10:45.265 --> 10:48.064
What does he do with the video?
Maybe he keeps them?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.469
If he's a voyeur, yes.

10:49.470 --> 10:51.165
Ah, voyeurs are rarely violent.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.067
Their excitement comes from
spying without the object

10:53.068 --> 10:54.769
Knowing they're being watched.

10:54.770 --> 10:56.504
And by abducting his victims,

10:56.505 --> 10:58.539
He's removing the outlet
of his sexual release.

10:58.540 --> 10:59.774
Reid is right.

10:59.775 --> 11:03.163
So he must have some other
agenda with these cameras.

11:03.164 --> 11:05.679
He might be sharing the
footage with other people.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.573
We need to have Garcia
dig into surveillance

11:07.574 --> 11:08.994
In illegal video websites.

11:08.995 --> 11:10.751
I'm going to take
this with us. Why?

11:10.752 --> 11:13.492
We originally profiled there
wasn't any facial similarity

11:13.493 --> 11:16.341
Between the victims,
but I'm not so sure that's true.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.611
I want to compare Dorris'
picture with the other victims.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.682
These videos the unsub took,
it looks like

11:23.683 --> 11:27.352
One of them he posted online,
which may help me nab it.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.373
If he puts it on the Web,

11:28.374 --> 11:31.122
Can't you track that back
directly to his computer?

11:31.123 --> 11:33.741
Normally, yes. Normally,
in like in 17 seconds

11:33.742 --> 11:35.258
I can get you the
network he's using,

11:35.259 --> 11:36.896
Get a physical
address of his modem,

11:36.897 --> 11:38.290
And presto change-o,
no more bad guy,

11:38.291 --> 11:42.264
But this unsub is a creepy
computer aficionado.

11:42.265 --> 11:44.069
Do you guys know what
a proxy server is?

11:44.070 --> 11:45.337
It's an Internet relay.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.806
Precisely. Kids use them to
get around blocked sites.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.726
Now, usually one proxy is plenty,

11:49.727 --> 11:52.911
But this piece of work is
using dozens of proxy servers.

11:52.912 --> 11:56.214
He's bounced his signal
off of China, north Korea,

11:56.215 --> 11:57.754
Russia, South Africa...

11:57.755 --> 11:59.980
Garcia, can you trace
him back to Boise?

11:59.981 --> 12:01.586
Of course I can,
and that's what I'm doing?

12:01.587 --> 12:04.965
Time is the unfortunate
ingredient I need, though.

12:05.424 --> 12:06.817
This just in.

12:06.818 --> 12:08.998
Looks like one of the proxy
servers archived What

12:08.999 --> 12:11.730
he was streaming on the night of
Dorris archer's disappearance.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.298
Can we see it? Pulling it up now.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.014
Well, Prentiss and
Morgan were right.

12:22.015 --> 12:23.950
He knows the house.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.413
And the dog knows him.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.128
Oh, please don't hurt that doggie.

12:30.129 --> 12:32.197
How many trips inside the
house would that take?

12:32.198 --> 12:33.405
A dozen?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.710
See that? The camera's attached to him.
It's his point of view.

12:58.711 --> 13:01.980
So he can relive it
over and over again.

13:04.593 --> 13:06.418
Ok, can someone tell
me when this is over?

13:11.057 --> 13:13.992
Please. Not yet.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.487
He's tender to her.

13:29.488 --> 13:32.844
She means more to him as a
corpse than as a living person.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.773
Garcia, we need to find
the unsub's network.

13:34.774 --> 13:35.971
Even if it's a rough area,

13:35.972 --> 13:37.720
it'll help narrow the
geographic profile.

13:37.721 --> 13:39.818
Yeah. Sir, that's totally
what I'm trying to figure out.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.104
Uh, there is something else kind
of huge you need to know about.

13:43.105 --> 13:46.673
Do you see this
line of code there?

13:46.674 --> 13:47.542
Yeah, what about them?

13:47.543 --> 13:51.044
It allows the user admin,
and in this case, the unsub,

13:51.045 --> 13:53.016
To set up a chat room.

13:53.017 --> 13:55.244
People were watching this
on the night of the murder.

13:55.245 --> 13:57.718
We thought he was posting these
after the fact. He's not.

13:57.719 --> 14:00.029
He wants people to
experience it with him.

14:00.289 --> 14:02.173
He wants an audience.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.842
He has fans.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.734
Can you freeze that?

14:14.735 --> 14:16.269
He's acknowledging the camera.

14:16.270 --> 14:18.405
Tip of the hat to his fans.
He knows they're watching.

14:18.406 --> 14:20.208
Classic narcissistic behavior.

14:20.209 --> 14:21.924
He's performing for his audience.

14:21.925 --> 14:23.472
We know the m.O.
The question is how.

14:23.473 --> 14:25.884
What kind of job gives him
access to the victims' houses?

14:25.885 --> 14:27.747
It has to be network and I.T.S,

14:27.748 --> 14:29.397
The guy you let in to
hook up your Internet.

14:29.398 --> 14:31.656
Gets him in their house
and on their computers.

14:31.657 --> 14:34.256
I went through all the women's
Internet service providers

14:34.257 --> 14:35.560
With a fine-tooth comb.

14:35.561 --> 14:37.385
They all used different companies

14:37.386 --> 14:39.344
And no overlap with sales reps.

14:39.345 --> 14:40.997
What about onsite tech support?

14:40.998 --> 14:42.629
Oh, well, clean as a whistle.

14:42.630 --> 14:45.417
They all had alibis with
no criminal records.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.846
What I don't understand is,

14:46.847 --> 14:50.180
Why does he take the bodies
with him after they're dead?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.270
Yeah, it'd be one thing if he took
them while they were still alive,

14:52.271 --> 14:54.320
But he's accomplished his task.

14:54.321 --> 14:57.223
He murders them and he
completes the performance.

14:57.224 --> 15:00.612
So why take the risk of
carrying a corpse to your car?

15:00.613 --> 15:02.027
Well, there must be
some postmortem behavior

15:02.028 --> 15:03.596
Or signature or something
we're not seeing.

15:03.597 --> 15:04.978
Well, think about
that for a second.

15:04.979 --> 15:08.667
He's sharing this murder
with a crowd of onlookers.

15:08.668 --> 15:12.737
What could he be doing to
these bodies just for himself?

15:12.738 --> 15:14.114
Hey, guys.

15:14.115 --> 15:15.715
Garcia's got something for us.

15:15.716 --> 15:17.250
Go ahead, baby girl.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.785
Ok, friends,
I have some good news,

15:18.786 --> 15:20.983
But first, here is
the thing that sucks.

15:20.984 --> 15:24.795
I located the network the
unsub is using in Boise,

15:24.796 --> 15:26.593
And it is the
victims' own wireless.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.962
So does he hack in before
he starts with the murders?

15:28.963 --> 15:31.498
Hacking is obscenely
time-consuming.

15:31.499 --> 15:34.568
I just make it look easy because
I'm a genius. But he's not me.

15:34.569 --> 15:37.270
So my guess is that he's got
to lurk around their network

15:37.271 --> 15:40.273
For at least a couple of days
to a week before he kills them.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.108
That's pretty
brilliant on his part.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.010
Yeah, he knows when we
follow his online paper trail

15:44.011 --> 15:45.879
That it'll lead us right
back to the murder site.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.147
What's the good news?

15:47.148 --> 15:49.683
Hackers are very loyal to
their spoofing techniques,

15:49.684 --> 15:50.864
And if they think
no one's watching,

15:50.865 --> 15:52.752
They'll use the same
roads over and over.

15:52.753 --> 15:56.265
Ok, so if he goes through Russia,
China, and north Korea again...

15:56.266 --> 15:57.566
I have flagged those servers,

15:57.567 --> 15:58.940
And if he uses them
in the same order,

15:58.941 --> 16:00.436
I will catch him so fast.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.838
That's only going to help us
if he commits another murder.

16:02.839 --> 16:04.740
Yes, that's also true.

16:04.741 --> 16:05.941
Excuse me.

16:05.942 --> 16:08.738
Garcia, if he does
stream this again,

16:08.739 --> 16:10.746
How much time will you
need to find the network?

16:10.747 --> 16:12.710
Oh, uh, that's hard to guess

16:12.711 --> 16:14.049
With all the international
pinging. I--

16:14.050 --> 16:16.585
Ballpark. Uh, 7 minutes?

16:16.586 --> 16:18.854
That's not fast enough.
He's in and out of the house in 5.

16:18.855 --> 16:22.294
Oh, God. I'm going to have
to trim my time down, then.

16:22.295 --> 16:26.228
Garcia, get it done. JJ,
we need to call a press conference.

16:26.229 --> 16:27.652
Now that we know how
he's killing these women,

16:27.653 --> 16:29.061
We need to get it out there.

16:29.062 --> 16:31.834
Uh, all right, I'll, uh,
prescreen the journalists I call on,

16:31.835 --> 16:33.602
Hope we don't get anything
out of left field.

16:33.603 --> 16:35.137
Good.

16:35.138 --> 16:36.705
I know what connects the victims.

16:37.640 --> 16:39.656
I was staring at
pictures of the victims

16:39.657 --> 16:40.825
And I knew there was a
pattern connecting them,

16:40.826 --> 16:43.548
But I couldn't tell what it was until
I broke it down mathematically.

16:43.549 --> 16:45.681
Why are we so drawn
to celebrity faces?

16:45.682 --> 16:47.449
Because there's a
symmetry to their beauty--

16:47.450 --> 16:49.613
The eyes, the ears, the ratio
of the forehead to the chin.

16:49.614 --> 16:50.668
The more balanced they are,

16:50.669 --> 16:52.220
The more appealing
they are to our eye.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.708
These women aren't
celebrities, though.

16:53.709 --> 16:55.077
No, but there are
similarities between them,

16:55.078 --> 16:56.481
And it wasn't until I
scanned their pictures

16:56.482 --> 16:58.427
And got it to the guys at Quantico
that I had a full breakdown.

16:58.428 --> 17:00.963
All right, strip away eye color,
hair color, and skin tone,

17:00.964 --> 17:02.998
And what are we left
with geometrically?

17:02.999 --> 17:04.366
They're all slightly dystopic.

17:04.367 --> 17:05.898
The left eye is slightly lower

17:05.900 --> 17:07.269
than the right eye
on all the victims.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.771
All the noses are narrow.

17:09.771 --> 17:11.940
The forehead has the same Ridge.

17:11.941 --> 17:14.001
He might not even be aware
that he sees it in them.

17:14.002 --> 17:15.320
There have been
studies that suggest

17:15.321 --> 17:16.780
That we pick our
spouses subconsciously,

17:16.781 --> 17:18.680
Based on a facial symmetry
that we recognize.

17:18.681 --> 17:20.214
So consciously or unconsciously,

17:20.215 --> 17:23.152
When he recognizes it,
he has to destroy it.

17:23.153 --> 17:24.819
Which means he only has
interest in the bodies

17:24.820 --> 17:26.622
As they relate back to him.

17:26.623 --> 17:28.690
Maybe...

17:28.691 --> 17:30.759
They're a reflection.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.762
Remember what he did at
the end of the video?

17:36.888 --> 17:38.700
He wiped the tear away.

17:38.701 --> 17:41.470
Another act of compassion
he's not capable of.

17:41.471 --> 17:43.572
His narcissism
prevents him from that.

17:43.573 --> 17:45.669
In the Greek myth,
narcissus was so self-absorbed

17:45.670 --> 17:47.709
That he fell in love with his
own reflection in the water.

17:47.710 --> 17:50.212
Exactly. He finds women
with the same face,

17:50.213 --> 17:54.283
He strangles them, and then
stares at them after they've died.

17:54.284 --> 17:56.536
But whose image
does he really see?

17:56.537 --> 17:58.241
His own.

18:03.993 --> 18:05.627
Thank you.

18:15.961 --> 18:17.945
Mmm! SCONES!

18:36.017 --> 18:37.793
Most of us take the
Internet for granted.

18:37.794 --> 18:40.229
We forget about
texts that we share

18:40.230 --> 18:42.580
Or updates we put
on social networks.

18:42.581 --> 18:44.466
But the Internet never forgets.

18:44.467 --> 18:46.401
Once it's out there,
it's out there forever.

18:46.402 --> 18:47.833
Now, we all know about the

18:47.834 --> 18:49.404
horrific deaths that
get shown on the Web.

18:49.405 --> 18:52.641
The murder of a journalist.
The stoning of an Iranian dissident.

18:52.642 --> 18:54.709
Those murders are immortal.

18:54.710 --> 18:57.003
And this unsub craves
that same immortality.

18:57.004 --> 18:58.700
He recognizes his face on theirs

18:58.701 --> 19:00.477
And he kills them
as a way of saying,

19:00.478 --> 19:01.732
"This is what I look like."

19:01.733 --> 19:03.564
We think this also
informs his compulsion

19:03.565 --> 19:04.723
To take the bodies with him.

19:04.724 --> 19:06.596
He takes them to a
secondary location

19:06.597 --> 19:08.398
Where we believe
he preserves them,

19:08.399 --> 19:10.066
So that every time
he looks at them,

19:10.067 --> 19:11.634
He sees his own ego reflected.

19:11.635 --> 19:13.836
Fortunately for us,
this means we have a good idea

19:13.837 --> 19:15.471
Of what he looks like.

19:15.472 --> 19:18.074
Based on the shape of
the victims' faces,

19:18.075 --> 19:21.344
We have a rough composite sketch.

19:21.345 --> 19:24.760
This unsub is an expert with
computers and home networks.

19:24.761 --> 19:27.745
So look into criminal records of men
with extensive computer training.

19:27.746 --> 19:28.462
We know you've already looked into

19:28.463 --> 19:30.614
the victims' computer I.
T. Settings,

19:30.615 --> 19:32.722
So we'd like to expand the search.

19:32.723 --> 19:34.190
Look into electronic stores,

19:34.191 --> 19:37.226
Computer distributors, I.T.
Departments where the women worked.

19:37.227 --> 19:39.712
We overuse the term
narcissistic in our culture,

19:39.713 --> 19:42.384
But we're going back to the
psychological definition.

19:42.385 --> 19:44.320
Every aspect of this man's life

19:44.321 --> 19:46.989
Has been constructed around
an inflated sense of self.

19:46.990 --> 19:48.924
Unsubs like this are
particularly vulnerable

19:48.925 --> 19:51.427
To what's called
narcissistic injury.

19:51.428 --> 19:55.764
If his self-worth is attacked
or damaged, he will lash out.

19:55.765 --> 19:59.401
So, if you find this unsub,
do not challenge him publicly.

19:59.402 --> 20:01.003
Say you just want to talk him,

20:01.004 --> 20:04.206
See if he knows anything about
the brilliant mastermind

20:04.207 --> 20:05.874
Who's stalking these women.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.310
Under no circumstances
should you denigrate him.

20:08.311 --> 20:11.380
As difficult as it is,
we need to talk up his exploits

20:11.381 --> 20:13.872
As if we respected him.

20:13.873 --> 20:16.535
Searching for wireless
server dound kitgirl29

20:22.092 --> 20:24.426
This is a sketch of the
man we're looking for.

20:24.427 --> 20:25.828
He is a white male,

20:25.829 --> 20:27.296
Roughly 5'10".

20:27.297 --> 20:30.099
He's highly skilled with
computers and networks.

20:30.100 --> 20:31.693
We encourage everyone to

20:31.694 --> 20:33.924
monitor the information
they post about themselves

20:33.925 --> 20:35.130
On social networks.

20:35.131 --> 20:38.645
Do not document the
details of your day.

20:38.646 --> 20:41.676
Don't post pictures of yourself,
friends, or family.

20:41.677 --> 20:43.277
All right, we'll take
some questions. Yeah?

20:43.278 --> 20:46.307
How did the FBI generate this sketch
if there were no eyewitnesses?

20:46.308 --> 20:49.777
It's a approximation based
on a video we recovered.

20:49.778 --> 20:51.712
Ok, yeah, what's your question?

20:51.713 --> 20:53.232
Can you comment on the rumor he

20:53.233 --> 20:55.816
has some sort of facial
symmetry with his victims?

20:56.877 --> 20:57.905
Does he look like them?

20:57.906 --> 21:01.105
Right now the Boise police are
pursuing several theories.

21:01.106 --> 21:02.382
That's not a no.

21:02.383 --> 21:04.350
Why would he target
women who look like him?

21:04.351 --> 21:07.817
It's too soon to speculate on how
or why he chooses his victims.

21:07.818 --> 21:09.638
Well, what should people
do to protect themselves,

21:09.639 --> 21:10.758
change their face?

21:10.759 --> 21:13.324
No, just update
your online security

21:13.325 --> 21:15.244
And be vigilant
about what you post.

21:15.245 --> 21:16.629
All right, we're
done with questions.

21:16.630 --> 21:18.064
Thank you. Thank you.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.157
Hotch.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.873
Somebody leaked our profile.

21:32.874 --> 21:36.081
The press started asking
questions about facial symmetry.

21:36.082 --> 21:37.637
It must have been one
of your officers.

21:37.638 --> 21:39.378
Look, my guys were
checking their cell phones,

21:39.379 --> 21:40.667
But that's just habit now.

21:40.668 --> 21:42.896
All right, I can talk to
the press independently,

21:42.897 --> 21:44.431
I can keep this off
the 10:00 news, but--

21:44.432 --> 21:46.411
I know. It went out live.

21:46.412 --> 21:48.691
Well, what are the
chances he didn't see it?

21:48.692 --> 21:50.283
Not good.

21:52.340 --> 21:56.176
Oh, your crafty little sicko.

21:58.479 --> 22:00.681
Sir, it's fantastic you called.
I just figured out--

22:00.682 --> 22:02.749
How are you doing on
pinning down the networks?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.189
Ok, that's what I'm
trying to tell you.

22:04.190 --> 22:07.065
Remember how I said he was spoofing
his signal off different servers?

22:07.066 --> 22:09.920
Well, it turns out some of those
are a decoy meant to waste my time.

22:09.921 --> 22:11.557
So does that mean you
can find him faster?

22:11.558 --> 22:13.126
Totally. Totally.
I can write a program

22:13.127 --> 22:15.381
That filters out the decoys--

22:15.396 --> 22:16.930
Oh, crap.

22:16.931 --> 22:17.964
Is that him?

22:17.965 --> 22:20.200
Yeah. Uh...

22:20.201 --> 22:23.785
Ok. It looks like I'm gonna
have to filter this on the fly.

22:23.786 --> 22:25.114
Can you send us the feed?

22:25.115 --> 22:27.348
I think I can intercept
it in Ukraine.

22:27.349 --> 22:29.062
He's going live.

22:30.419 --> 22:31.974
Look at the way he's moving.

22:31.975 --> 22:34.148
He's not slow and deliberate.
This guy's pissed.

22:34.149 --> 22:35.623
All right, what do we see?
Determining markers.

22:35.624 --> 22:36.891
A one-story cottage.

22:36.892 --> 22:37.992
It could be anywhere.

22:37.993 --> 22:39.190
Is there a number on the house?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.962
No, and he's already at the door.

22:40.963 --> 22:41.681
Garcia.

22:41.682 --> 22:44.288
He's using twice as
many proxy servers.

22:44.289 --> 22:46.267
Wait. This window here on the bottom-
is that the chat room?

22:46.268 --> 22:47.302
Uh-huh.

22:47.415 --> 22:49.400
There she is.
He's in the house, guys.

22:49.401 --> 22:50.897
He's completely changed his m.O.

22:50.898 --> 22:52.140
It is way too early.
There's too much light.

22:52.141 --> 22:53.107
What happened?

22:53.108 --> 22:55.610
Someone asked the wrong question
at the press conference.

22:55.611 --> 22:58.446
Oh, my God, turn around.
Just turn around.

22:58.447 --> 23:00.120
Maybe she can fend him off.

23:00.121 --> 23:01.950
New kitchen appliances.
Can we track them through work orders?

23:01.951 --> 23:02.851
He'll be gone by then.

23:02.852 --> 23:04.352
Garcia, give us something.

23:04.353 --> 23:06.054
I'm stateside now.
I'm almost to Idaho.

23:06.055 --> 23:07.889
You're not gonna make it.
I just need more time.

23:07.890 --> 23:09.591
Yes, I will. I will. I--

23:09.592 --> 23:10.612
Forget the unsub. Can you

23:10.613 --> 23:12.381
run a trace on everybody
in the chat room?

23:12.382 --> 23:14.863
I can't do both, sir.
Let me do this.

23:14.864 --> 23:16.965
Garcia, tag the viewers.
That's an order.

24:02.181 --> 24:04.483
Baby girl, it's gonna be OK.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.151
No, no, it's not. It's bad enough

24:06.152 --> 24:08.086
That there's been so
much death around me,

24:08.087 --> 24:10.579
But this guy is all up in my turf,

24:10.580 --> 24:13.659
And he's really good at what he
does for really awful reasons.

24:13.660 --> 24:15.027
That's why you're gonna
find the perverts

24:15.028 --> 24:16.628
That watched it happen
in that chat room,

24:16.629 --> 24:17.732
And we'll nail them to the wall

24:17.733 --> 24:19.324
And they're gonna
give up the unsub.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.421
No, no, that is not good enough.

24:20.422 --> 24:24.374
I want to watch him suffer.
I want to watch him bleed.

24:24.637 --> 24:26.772
Oh, God, I just scared myself.

24:26.773 --> 24:28.607
Good. That's a good thing.

24:28.608 --> 24:30.661
Because if there's one thing
I've learned the hard way

24:30.662 --> 24:33.578
Is the last person you want to
tick off is miss Penelope Garcia.

24:33.579 --> 24:37.115
Ohh...That's a compliment, right?

24:37.116 --> 24:38.317
Yes, it is.

24:39.069 --> 24:41.233
We will beat this guy.
Believe that.

24:41.234 --> 24:44.069
Now, I'll call you when
we've got something. Ok.

24:46.766 --> 24:48.609
Her name was Allison Kittridge, 29.

24:48.610 --> 24:50.609
This was her first house.

24:53.441 --> 24:56.505
All right, so this unsub accelerated
his timetable and his m.O.

24:56.506 --> 24:58.331
He was moving faster
because he was angry.

24:58.332 --> 24:59.853
Yeah. The press
conference told him

24:59.854 --> 25:01.282
something about himself
he didn't like,

25:01.283 --> 25:03.177
So he rushed. Which
means he made a mistake.

25:03.178 --> 25:05.527
Now, what was it?

25:07.889 --> 25:09.039
Well, it wasn't the cameras.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.850
He remembered to
take those with him.

25:10.851 --> 25:13.644
It wasn't the body.
He took that with him, too.

25:16.045 --> 25:20.724
Hey, did, uh, Garcia find anything
unusual with Allison's wireless?

25:20.725 --> 25:24.558
No. Records show that it was
a basic DSL installation.

25:26.717 --> 25:28.571
Hey, Prentiss.

25:28.572 --> 25:30.718
Yeah. Help me move this table.

25:33.457 --> 25:35.058
What do you got?

25:38.334 --> 25:39.963
You see this line right here?

25:41.399 --> 25:42.743
Yeah.

25:42.744 --> 25:45.135
This is what brings the Internet
from the street into the house.

25:45.136 --> 25:48.492
Ok. So? This isn't DSL.

25:48.493 --> 25:49.607
It's not?

25:49.608 --> 25:51.098
It's a fiber-optic cable.

25:51.099 --> 25:53.105
Completely different
type of connection.

25:55.746 --> 25:58.181
We just found his mistake.

26:00.806 --> 26:02.693
If there's already an Internet
connection in the house,

26:02.694 --> 26:04.889
Why does he bring his own with him?
Is it the upload speed?

26:04.890 --> 26:07.164
Fiber-optic allows him to
stream large amounts of video.

26:07.165 --> 26:08.370
And maintain a chat room.

26:08.371 --> 26:10.734
That's dozens of computers
connected to him at once.

26:10.735 --> 26:13.175
He'd need a lot of bandwidth
for something like that.

26:13.176 --> 26:15.620
We checked all the ISPs.
Why didn't he turn up?

26:15.621 --> 26:18.211
I get mail, phone calls,
people knock on my door all the time

26:18.212 --> 26:19.492
To see if I want to
upgrade my Internet.

26:19.493 --> 26:20.779
Yeah, I get them, too.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.680
And they'll offer to come
inside and demonstrate

26:22.681 --> 26:24.564
How much faster
their connection is.

26:24.565 --> 26:26.550
You think that's the ruse
that gets him in the door?

26:26.551 --> 26:27.785
It makes sense.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.577
During his demonstration,
he would have access

26:29.578 --> 26:30.954
To his victims' computers.

26:30.955 --> 26:32.735
On his way out,
he asks for a glass of water,

26:32.736 --> 26:34.316
A distraction,
something to buy enough time

26:34.317 --> 26:35.813
to plant that first camera.

26:35.814 --> 26:38.228
We need to find out what
company owns this cable.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.618
Detective Fordham's
already hunting that down,

26:39.619 --> 26:41.843
And there's an I.D. Number on it,
so it shouldn't take long.

26:41.844 --> 26:43.044
We'll have JJ and Reid follow up.

26:43.045 --> 26:44.813
I need you two to track down
who was in the chat room.

26:44.814 --> 26:46.114
Garcia finished her sweep?

26:46.115 --> 26:47.749
Yeah. Most were international.
3 were local.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.250
I bet one of them knows the unsub.

27:01.461 --> 27:02.881
FBI.

27:02.882 --> 27:04.530
We have a warrant.

27:23.077 --> 27:24.459
Help you gentlemen?

27:24.460 --> 27:25.527
Austin Chapman?

27:25.528 --> 27:27.028
Yeah, that's me.

27:27.029 --> 27:28.463
FBI.

27:28.464 --> 27:32.354
We need talk to you about a
video you watched last night.

27:33.764 --> 27:36.128
I'm sorry. What video?

27:36.129 --> 27:38.473
This is a warrant for all the
computers in your possession.

27:38.474 --> 27:40.497
You're under arrest for
accessory to murder.

27:40.498 --> 27:41.809
Accessory?

27:41.810 --> 27:43.646
Watching a murder happen online

27:43.647 --> 27:46.103
and doing nothing
about it Is a felony.

27:48.284 --> 27:51.205
I don't know what
you're talking about.

27:51.911 --> 27:53.735
What murder?

27:57.359 --> 27:58.826
Yes, this is our cable.

27:58.827 --> 28:00.662
Mrs. Hightower,
we went over your records,

28:00.663 --> 28:02.463
And it turns out that
none of the 4 victims

28:02.464 --> 28:03.765
Signed up with your service.

28:03.766 --> 28:07.025
4? God, those poor women.

28:07.026 --> 28:09.904
We think it's an employee
using your cable as a ruse

28:09.905 --> 28:11.773
To get into the house.
Can you think of any--

28:11.774 --> 28:13.575
Mac Jones.

28:13.576 --> 28:15.677
Uh, he worked on one of our trucks

28:15.678 --> 28:18.475
As we laid the fiber in
with the regular phone line.

28:18.476 --> 28:19.826
And you're certain that it's him?

28:19.827 --> 28:21.049
We caught him hoarding it.

28:21.050 --> 28:23.585
He said it was for a home project.

28:23.586 --> 28:26.682
Until we got angry phone calls
that he was going door to door

28:26.683 --> 28:29.591
Offering free fiber-optic
installation.

28:29.592 --> 28:31.125
We fired him on the spot.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.360
We need his information.

28:32.361 --> 28:33.595
Absolutely.

28:36.161 --> 28:39.467
Ladies and gentlemen,
meet Mac Jones.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.798
That isn't the I.D.
We got from the phone company.

28:41.799 --> 28:45.385
That's because last year Mr.
Jones had his identity stolen.

28:45.386 --> 28:47.508
The unsub took his license
and his credit card,

28:47.509 --> 28:49.177
Used them for 2 weeks,
and then moved on.

28:49.178 --> 28:52.029
Now, I can't tell you who the
unsub is pretending to be now,

28:52.030 --> 28:54.154
But since a picture's worth
a thousand databases,

28:54.155 --> 28:55.626
I can tell you who he was.

28:55.627 --> 28:57.485
Robert Johnson, 3-time loser,

28:57.486 --> 28:58.853
Arrested for possession
of torture videos.

28:58.854 --> 29:01.623
Spent some time in a halfway
house before he disappeared.

29:01.624 --> 29:03.758
I found a blog of his online.
Here's a quote--

29:03.759 --> 29:06.160
"Next time you won't
be able to stop me."

29:06.161 --> 29:07.795
That's his narcissism again.

29:07.796 --> 29:10.598
Furious that he got caught and
he remakes himself as a killer.

29:10.599 --> 29:12.817
It allows him to free the
impulses that were always there.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.270
Garcia, is there a pattern to
the identities that he steals?

29:15.271 --> 29:17.160
No. He's really
disciplined about it.

29:17.161 --> 29:18.293
Once he burns through an identity,

29:18.294 --> 29:19.674
he never uses the same one again.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.410
You know how I describe some
suspects as being off the grid?

29:22.411 --> 29:24.465
This guy is totally the opposite.

29:24.466 --> 29:26.065
He's all over the grid.

29:26.066 --> 29:27.555
He's manipulating the grid.

29:27.556 --> 29:29.417
And he never stays in
one place for very long.

29:29.418 --> 29:31.019
So how do we find
out who he is now?

29:31.020 --> 29:32.387
I don't think we're going to.

29:32.388 --> 29:34.922
The man known as Robert
Johnson is in the wind.

29:34.923 --> 29:37.959
If he's this flexible with his name,
his real name, forget it.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.827
But there's another
way we can find him.

29:39.828 --> 29:40.828
Which is?

29:40.829 --> 29:41.863
His online name,

29:41.864 --> 29:43.197
His hacker handle.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.466
That's the name
that matters to him.

29:45.467 --> 29:47.135
Wait. Wouldn't he have
hundreds of those, too?

29:47.136 --> 29:49.637
Most definitely. But remember
how I said hackers are loyal?

29:49.638 --> 29:51.205
They stick to certain names.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.241
That's how you identify
yourself to other hackers.

29:53.242 --> 29:55.543
That's how the FBI caught me.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.111
So if we find the handle...

29:57.112 --> 29:59.881
I'll get you the unsub. I promise.

30:00.816 --> 30:05.787
Look, I wish I could
help you find the guy

30:05.788 --> 30:07.755
Posting these videos,

30:07.756 --> 30:11.569
But I never visited that website,
man. Right.

30:11.570 --> 30:14.295
Maybe somebody broke into
my computer or something.

30:14.296 --> 30:16.064
See, Scott, we think it was you.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.380
And we found some pretty
interesting movies

30:18.381 --> 30:20.413
in your hard drive To
back up our theory.

30:23.396 --> 30:25.631
"White girls can't hump."

30:25.632 --> 30:27.106
That's nice.

30:27.107 --> 30:29.947
"Schindler's fist."

30:30.468 --> 30:33.641
See, this one right here,
this is the one that got my attention.

30:33.642 --> 30:36.444
"The erotic awakenings of Sandy."

30:36.445 --> 30:39.159
How old was the girl in that video?
What was she, 12?

30:39.160 --> 30:40.794
I...

30:40.795 --> 30:41.929
I can explain--

30:41.930 --> 30:43.897
Shut up!

30:45.634 --> 30:48.268
This is what's weird to me.

30:48.269 --> 30:50.142
Most of your files
were locked away,

30:50.143 --> 30:51.805
But not the child porn.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.828
We found it in like 5 minutes.

30:53.829 --> 30:57.211
It wasn't password
protected or anything.

30:57.212 --> 31:00.040
How does someone who's supposed
to be so smart with computers

31:00.041 --> 31:01.982
Do something so dumb?

31:04.753 --> 31:06.286
Can we cut a deal?

31:06.287 --> 31:10.724
You tell me what I want to know
and the maybe we'll talk deal.

31:14.329 --> 31:18.565
Before this guy accepts
you into the club...

31:18.566 --> 31:20.501
He gives you the illegal stuff.

31:20.502 --> 31:23.570
Kids. Torture.

31:24.381 --> 31:27.341
He has to know that you're
risking as much as he is.

31:28.343 --> 31:30.613
Mutually assured destruction.

31:30.614 --> 31:32.415
You rat him out,
he takes you with him.

31:32.416 --> 31:34.394
Yes.

31:34.848 --> 31:36.018
What's his name?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.687
I don't know. We never met.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.623
Don't you try and play me, kid.

31:40.624 --> 31:42.826
His online name.

31:42.827 --> 31:44.435
Watcher 89.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.640
Were there any other names?

31:45.641 --> 31:47.297
Not that I could find.
I don't like

31:47.298 --> 31:50.366
Signing up for porn unless
I know who's running it.

31:52.617 --> 31:54.321
Mrs. Prentiss.

31:55.339 --> 31:56.873
Agent Prentiss.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.929
There's something
else you should know.

31:58.930 --> 32:00.296
He sent out a message.

32:00.297 --> 32:03.713
He said tonight would
be the best one yet.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.381
He's attacking tonight?

32:05.382 --> 32:06.716
Of course.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.818
He knows you're watching him.

32:08.819 --> 32:12.173
He has to put on
an extra-good show.

32:17.447 --> 32:20.429
What's interesting, Mr. Chapman,

32:20.430 --> 32:23.433
The two other men we talked to,

32:23.434 --> 32:27.701
They had a form of collateral
on their hard drive.

32:27.702 --> 32:29.692
I'm sorry. Collateral?

32:29.693 --> 32:31.757
Hard-core pornography.

32:31.758 --> 32:34.401
Illegal. Rough.

32:34.402 --> 32:36.977
I would never look at
something like that.

32:36.978 --> 32:39.649
You have all my computers.
You must have searched them.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.985
Yes. And we found nothing.

32:41.986 --> 32:44.254
So, can I go?

32:45.356 --> 32:46.556
No.

32:46.557 --> 32:48.992
You see, there's still
that nagging question

32:48.993 --> 32:53.196
As to why you were logged on
to that chat room last night.

32:53.197 --> 32:56.199
Look...Agent Rossi,

32:56.200 --> 32:58.668
I'm at a loss here.

32:58.669 --> 33:01.971
First of all, I'm all thumbs
when it comes to computers.

33:01.972 --> 33:03.406
Or you're very good with them

33:03.407 --> 33:06.509
And know how to cover your tracks.

33:06.510 --> 33:07.944
Second of all,

33:07.945 --> 33:10.847
My grandkids were at the house
last night for a sleepover.

33:10.848 --> 33:12.569
They were in bed by 8:30.

33:12.570 --> 33:16.777
We were so exhausted,
my wife and I were asleep by 9:00.

33:17.454 --> 33:21.518
Please! Ask her.
She'll say the same thing.

33:21.519 --> 33:24.007
I don't think I even checked
my email last night.

33:26.916 --> 33:29.282
Do you know this man?

33:36.702 --> 33:38.059
Yes.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.276
He came into my
store a while back.

33:40.277 --> 33:41.878
Why?

33:41.879 --> 33:45.305
Uh, he said he liked my website.

33:45.306 --> 33:49.218
Which my son designed for me,
by the way.

33:49.219 --> 33:51.785
We chatted about appliances,

33:51.786 --> 33:53.725
He bought a few items and left.

33:53.726 --> 33:54.958
Did he have a name?

33:54.959 --> 33:58.261
No idea. We talked for 5 minutes.

34:00.364 --> 34:02.332
I'll be right back.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.405
Do you believe him?

34:10.262 --> 34:13.612
I believe he doesn't fit the
profile of the other voyeurs.

34:13.614 --> 34:14.944
They're good with computers.

34:14.945 --> 34:17.527
They have hacking experience.

34:21.819 --> 34:23.518
Garcia checked out the website.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.322
She said it's crude. You can't
even order anything from it.

34:26.322 --> 34:28.791
Maybe he's right.
Maybe the unsub manipulated him

34:28.792 --> 34:32.592
For something else, used his
network as part of his spoofing.

34:33.764 --> 34:34.964
Go ahead, Garcia.

34:34.965 --> 34:36.132
Watcher 89--I got him.

34:36.132 --> 34:37.533
Does he have his own network?

34:37.534 --> 34:38.501
He doesn't need one.

34:38.502 --> 34:39.835
He's got a whole
city to leech off of.

34:39.837 --> 34:40.902
He's doing this again tonight.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.237
Can you send me a list of networks

34:42.239 --> 34:45.208
He's hacked recently?
Those are the potential victims.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.242
I got 20 hits.

34:46.243 --> 34:47.829
All right. Filter out
men and families.

34:47.830 --> 34:49.779
He only kills single women.
8 left.

34:49.780 --> 34:51.347
Garcia, do you have any pictures?

34:51.348 --> 34:53.293
Coming your way.

35:02.037 --> 35:03.315
Her. She's the one.

35:03.316 --> 35:05.623
Lucy masters. You sure?

35:05.624 --> 35:08.164
She's the only one with facial
symmetry that would appeal to him.

35:19.677 --> 35:20.910
Lucy masters?

35:20.911 --> 35:23.546
This is the FBI! We're coming in.

35:31.755 --> 35:32.755
Clear!

35:32.756 --> 35:34.323
Clear!

35:39.884 --> 35:41.831
She's not here, but her car is.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.569
Hey. It just went on by itself.

35:48.972 --> 35:51.174
That's Lucy masters.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.815
He's recording us.

36:10.027 --> 36:12.128
Welcome to the show.

36:18.418 --> 36:20.940
Garcia, the unsub is working
off Lucy masters' network.

36:20.941 --> 36:22.894
Can you tell where the
video's being transmitted to?

36:22.895 --> 36:25.495
I can't tell. He's not
logged in as watcher 89.

36:25.496 --> 36:27.831
He's not using any of the
regular proxy servers.

36:27.832 --> 36:30.103
If I didn't know any better,
I wouldn't know that this was him.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.069
Damn it!

36:31.070 --> 36:32.732
He's encrypted his
connection to the proxies.

36:32.733 --> 36:34.368
There's nothing I can
do to help you find him.

36:34.369 --> 36:36.028
Metal walls. What do we see?

36:36.029 --> 36:38.219
It must be the secondary location
where he takes the victims.

36:38.220 --> 36:41.378
Wait a minute. Garcia,
can you magnify the wall behind her?

36:41.379 --> 36:43.450
Yeah, I can do that.

36:45.349 --> 36:47.384
Is that frost on the wall?

36:47.385 --> 36:48.385
It's a walk-in freezer.

36:48.386 --> 36:50.020
And I know where he got it.

36:58.506 --> 37:01.708
We didn't catch you by mistake,
did we, Austin?

37:01.709 --> 37:02.500
Excuse me?

37:02.501 --> 37:04.326
You said the unsub
liked your website,

37:04.327 --> 37:05.924
How it was designed.

37:05.925 --> 37:08.115
But it was your work.

37:08.116 --> 37:11.818
What you can repair,
what you can restore for him.

37:11.819 --> 37:15.522
You gave him a place
to hide the bodies.

37:15.523 --> 37:17.291
That's not true.

37:17.292 --> 37:18.525
Talk to my wife.

37:18.526 --> 37:20.928
I'm home by 6:00 every night--

37:20.929 --> 37:23.130
That's the first
thing voyeurs learn.

37:23.131 --> 37:25.165
How to cover their tracks.

37:25.166 --> 37:28.869
How to stalk between the
hours of 9:00 to 5:00.

37:28.870 --> 37:31.271
That's why there was no
porn on your computer.

37:31.272 --> 37:33.907
You had something better.

37:33.908 --> 37:36.643
This is a crime!

37:37.383 --> 37:39.880
I would never do what
you're describing.

37:39.881 --> 37:42.849
And even if you don't believe me,
my wife knows.

37:42.850 --> 37:45.185
My kids, my grandkids.

37:45.186 --> 37:47.212
I hate computers.

37:47.213 --> 37:49.222
I don't even know how they work.

37:49.223 --> 37:51.776
Well, then let me give
you your first lesson.

37:51.777 --> 37:55.796
When something goes out on the Internet,
it's out there forever.

37:55.797 --> 37:58.599
Now, you're going to jail.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.801
That's a foregone conclusion.

38:00.802 --> 38:03.904
But, unless you cooperate with me,

38:03.905 --> 38:06.476
I will do everything
I can to make sure

38:06.477 --> 38:09.164
That the next time your
grandkids Google you,

38:09.165 --> 38:14.481
They will find out what kind
of a monster grandpa really is.

38:14.482 --> 38:17.951
Now, I will ask you once--

38:17.952 --> 38:21.154
Where is the freezer?

38:23.858 --> 38:26.226
1823 Hudson. I got it.
We're on our way.

38:26.227 --> 38:28.684
Garcia, it's been 3 minutes
since the signal went up live.

38:28.685 --> 38:30.530
Lucy might not have
that much time left.

38:30.531 --> 38:32.766
I can buy you some. Now that
I've got his physical address,

38:32.767 --> 38:34.901
I got my business all up in his.

39:21.349 --> 39:23.617
No, no, not today.

39:36.064 --> 39:37.229
No!

39:37.532 --> 39:38.732
No!

39:38.733 --> 39:39.758
Now, when your Internet goes down,

39:39.759 --> 39:41.958
It ruins your whole day,
doesn't it, psycho?

39:42.770 --> 39:44.060
No!

40:06.561 --> 40:07.828
Get off her! Let her go!

40:07.829 --> 40:09.362
Get your hands off!

40:09.363 --> 40:10.403
No! Let her go!

40:10.404 --> 40:12.599
No! No! Lucy.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.521
Get the paramedics in here!

40:14.522 --> 40:17.137
Ok. Ok. It's over. It's OK.

40:17.138 --> 40:19.573
Go, go, go, go.

40:21.342 --> 40:22.843
Morgan.

40:23.186 --> 40:25.746
It's Dorris archer...

40:25.747 --> 40:27.914
And Allison kittridge.

40:28.761 --> 40:30.884
You killed these
women for your fans,

40:30.885 --> 40:32.886
But this is where you kept
them for yourself, isn't it,

40:32.887 --> 40:34.554
You sick son of a bitch.

40:35.272 --> 40:37.961
What do you see when
you look at them?

40:41.629 --> 40:45.132
You'll never
understand what I did.

40:45.133 --> 40:46.433
But out there,

40:47.046 --> 40:49.503
My followers...

40:49.504 --> 40:51.868
They understand.

40:51.869 --> 40:54.146
Well, too bad there's
no wireless in prison.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.819
Get him out of here!

41:13.194 --> 41:15.128
"The Internet is the first thing

41:15.129 --> 41:18.932
"That humanity has built that
humanity doesn't understand,

41:18.933 --> 41:23.003
The largest experiment in
anarchy that we have ever had."

41:23.004 --> 41:24.738
Eric Schmidt.

41:32.706 --> 41:35.586
Just for the record...

41:36.088 --> 41:38.051
I didn't do this.
