09:24.792 --> 09:25.834
[grunts]

09:25.917 --> 09:27.625
I was killing it until I hit that railing.

09:27.709 --> 09:29.041
[Levi] My mom would never do that.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.375
-She's a total worry--
-Dr. Schmitt, order tib/fib X-rays

09:31.458 --> 09:33.041
and page me when they're done, please.

09:33.125 --> 09:36.208
[Bailey] Okay, Erika, I'd like to do
an abdominal ultrasound.

09:36.291 --> 09:37.458
Oh. Nice.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.709
I've lost 50 pounds in Q-tine.

09:39.792 --> 09:41.458
Check out these abs.

09:41.542 --> 09:42.458
Damn.

09:42.542 --> 09:44.250
That railing ate me alive.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.917
-Yep.
-Oh.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.083
Okay, let me know if this hurts at all.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.583
Fifty pounds, huh?

09:51.750 --> 09:55.792
[Erika] Tech lawyer. Boatloads of money,
but...tech lawyer.

09:55.875 --> 09:58.542
Sedentary job, sedentary life.

09:58.625 --> 10:01.458
Then COVID hit,
and I figured, if the world's ending,

10:01.542 --> 10:03.709
I might as well be happy. [chuckles]

10:03.792 --> 10:05.792
I was so tired of being tired, you know?

10:05.875 --> 10:07.750
So, I quit that job that I hated,

10:07.834 --> 10:09.291
spent time with my kids,

10:09.375 --> 10:10.875
started working out,

10:10.959 --> 10:13.375
then I started my own business
making peanut brittle.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.041
Ooh. Try some.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.542
Ooh.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.417
No eating in the hospital.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.709
Um, so, Erika, it looks like
you have some bleeding

10:22.792 --> 10:24.208
under your abdominal muscle,

10:24.291 --> 10:27.959
so we'll need to do a CT
to evaluate how severe it is.

10:28.041 --> 10:30.458
Alright, page me
when she's ready, Schmitt.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.375
I won't tell if you won't.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.583
[bag rustles]

10:38.417 --> 10:43.542
And I know we've only
technically met on the phone...

10:44.792 --> 10:46.959
but I'm marrying your sister,

10:47.041 --> 10:48.333
so how about you wake up

10:48.417 --> 10:50.750
and give me a "Congratulations"
or something?

10:50.834 --> 10:52.125
[sniffles]

10:52.208 --> 10:53.500
I mean, I heard you were tough,

10:53.583 --> 10:56.125
but I didn't think you were cold.

10:57.667 --> 10:58.834
[seagulls crying]

10:58.917 --> 11:00.959
[Meredith] I want you closer.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.834
[Derek] You're worried about the kids.

11:02.917 --> 11:03.959
If you get closer...

11:04.041 --> 11:05.375
I'll never leave.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.000
I think that's the theory.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.792
Your dad died when you were young.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.375
Yes.

11:11.458 --> 11:12.625
And it almost ruined me.

11:12.709 --> 11:14.166
But it didn't.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.208
Kids survive.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.458
And struggle makes them stronger.

11:18.542 --> 11:20.583
Sometimes. Sometimes,
it makes them stronger,

11:20.667 --> 11:23.000
and sometimes, it makes them...

11:24.709 --> 11:25.834
Amelia.

11:25.917 --> 11:28.125
[both laugh]

11:28.208 --> 11:29.625
She's doing great, by the way.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.333
-I know.
-And she named her baby --

11:31.417 --> 11:32.417
I know!

11:32.500 --> 11:34.959
[both laugh]

11:35.041 --> 11:37.542
-Oh.
-[sighs]

11:37.625 --> 11:39.291
People love you, Meredith.

11:41.583 --> 11:42.959
People need you.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.166
I'm tired.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.667
Your body's tired.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.000
But your soul --

11:48.083 --> 11:50.458
your soul won't even let me near you.

11:51.458 --> 11:52.917
You're still fighting.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.667
Have you seen the last...

11:57.917 --> 11:59.583
one or two years?

12:00.709 --> 12:01.917
Yeah.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.083
Was that hard for you?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.291
It's harder watching you be lonely.

12:14.250 --> 12:18.917
I want to say you're beautiful,
but it's...shallow.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.834
Say "pretty on the inside."

12:20.917 --> 12:22.709
That's what I tell Zola to say.

12:22.792 --> 12:25.417
"Be pretty on the inside."

12:25.500 --> 12:28.125
You're pretty on the inside,
Meredith Grey.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.375
[chuckles]

12:37.291 --> 12:39.333
-How's Grey?
-Not getting better.

12:39.667 --> 12:43.041
She won't stay awake,
and her liver enzymes are elevated.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.542
Any sign of acute infection?

12:44.625 --> 12:45.917
No, but that doesn't mean anything

12:46.000 --> 12:47.166
because this stupid disease causes

12:47.250 --> 12:48.458
every complication in the book

12:48.542 --> 12:50.250
without any consistency whatsoever.

12:50.333 --> 12:51.458
Well, it's still relatively new.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.208
There's information coming out
every day, and --

12:53.291 --> 12:54.458
Yeah, <i>vague </i>information.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.542
We have no idea how this disease

12:56.625 --> 12:58.250
is gonna affect these patients
in the long-term.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.834
I mean, there could be
permanent lung scarring,

12:59.917 --> 13:02.333
vascular damage, neurological issues --

13:02.417 --> 13:05.250
Eh, oh, no, please, keep -- keep going.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.417
Tom, I didn't -- [sighs]

13:06.500 --> 13:07.792
-I'm -- I'm sorry.
-[chuckles] That's...

13:07.875 --> 13:10.375
-I'm sure that you're fine.
-[door opens, closes]

13:10.458 --> 13:11.750
Alright. [sighs] She's all set.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.834
Okay. Great. Thanks.

13:14.709 --> 13:15.625
Tom, I'm sorry. I --

13:15.709 --> 13:18.125
Hey, Doc, you're just stating facts.
Don't be sorry.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.458
[door slides shut]

13:19.542 --> 13:20.792
Okay.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.125
[grunts]

13:26.834 --> 13:27.875
What happened?

13:28.291 --> 13:29.583
[Owen] Carolyn Hexton.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.083
Cardiac arrest.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.917
When I talked with her yesterday,
she didn't even need oxygen.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.500
Yeah, and then she started
having arrhythmias,

13:37.583 --> 13:39.875
and then she went into V-fib.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.208
Thirty-seven years old.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.583
Kindergarten teacher.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.875
She ran 10ks for charity.

13:46.875 --> 13:48.625
I thought she'd be going home this week.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.041
Yeah. So did she.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.291
We all did.

13:53.125 --> 13:55.166
I got to call her family. [sighs]

13:57.917 --> 13:59.709
[sighs]

14:01.291 --> 14:03.250
[breathing shakily]

14:12.834 --> 14:15.500
Hello, Mrs. Hexton. This is Dr. Hunt.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.834
No. No, um...

14:19.750 --> 14:22.250
No. She -- Uh, she's, uh...

14:25.125 --> 14:28.333
Um, there were some complications.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.542
[sniffles]

14:30.667 --> 14:31.709
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hexton.

14:31.792 --> 14:33.834
Could you give me one moment, please?

14:45.125 --> 14:47.500
[woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.]

14:47.583 --> 14:49.166
Please tell me you're not eating in --

14:49.250 --> 14:51.083
I'm not! I'm not!
I'm just, uh -- I'm smelling.

14:51.166 --> 14:52.417
I-I miss smelling things.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.750
Smell things after work
in the comfort of your own home.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.583
My home smells like unwashed laundry.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.208
It's impressive, huh?

15:03.291 --> 15:05.375
Leaving a successful career,

15:05.458 --> 15:06.458
getting in shape,

15:06.542 --> 15:07.583
being there for your family.

15:07.667 --> 15:10.709
She really made lemonade out of, um...

15:11.375 --> 15:13.625
a-a very deadly virus.

15:14.291 --> 15:15.834
Must be nice.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.291
You think she should be doing
something different?

15:18.375 --> 15:22.375
I think if I suddenly started
baking snickerdoodles

15:22.458 --> 15:24.542
and going base jumping,

15:24.625 --> 15:27.041
do me a favor and throw a big net over me.

15:27.125 --> 15:28.709
It's peanut brittle.

15:28.792 --> 15:30.834
It's -- It's actually
a-a lot harder to master

15:30.917 --> 15:31.917
-than snickerdoodles.
-[computer beeping]

15:32.000 --> 15:33.208
Scans are up.

15:33.291 --> 15:35.208
Mm. Mm.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.208
Okay. Deep breaths, buddy.

15:37.291 --> 15:40.834
She told me to drop everything
I was doing and rush to the ER.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.500
-Well, Dr. Shepherd has a tendency...
-[door opens]

15:42.583 --> 15:46.083
...to, uh, raise the stakes
of any situation.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.625
MRI results will be back in a second.

15:47.709 --> 15:50.417
You look worried, and he keeps
telling me I'm gonna be fine.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.875
Dr. Shepherd, baseball is Felix's life.

15:52.959 --> 15:55.542
It's what got him into junior college,
and it's his only hope of getting

15:55.625 --> 15:56.625
into a Division I school.

15:56.709 --> 15:57.792
What would you do if suddenly,

15:57.875 --> 15:59.000
you couldn't be a surgeon anymore?

15:59.083 --> 16:00.583
[door opens]

16:00.667 --> 16:02.917
-You paged Koracick?
-No. Radiology did.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.583
Uh. Be right back.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.166
He has a meningioma, C6, 7.

16:08.250 --> 16:10.250
[Amelia] Let me look at it, please.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.917
That is a nasty little tumor.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.375
We'll have to do an intricate
multi-level decompression.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.083
Start with a wide excision,

16:16.166 --> 16:17.917
but that will destabilize
his cervical spine,

16:18.000 --> 16:19.125
so he'll need hardware.

16:19.208 --> 16:20.417
Forget about his pitching arm.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.333
Any slip, and you risk
making him a paraplegic.

16:22.417 --> 16:24.625
I mean, but there's a lot
going on with your sister

16:24.709 --> 16:25.750
and our lives.

16:25.834 --> 16:27.417
It's been a long time since...

16:27.500 --> 16:29.333
I'm not that rusty, thank you.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.750
You can go, Tom.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.166
Alright, one millimeter off --

16:32.250 --> 16:33.709
I said you can go, Tom.

16:33.792 --> 16:34.959
And, uh, if you want to help me,

16:35.041 --> 16:37.750
you can comfort the patient
while I book an OR.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.500
[Hayes] How we doing today?

16:44.500 --> 16:48.375
Oh, you know,
just thinking about how selfish it is

16:48.458 --> 16:50.250
to follow my dreams.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.166
I meant Luna, but, uh, good to know.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.125
[chuckles] Luna's trending upwards,

16:54.208 --> 16:58.542
so Luna is a bright spot
in a sea of unfettered misery.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.667
What's all this about dreams?

16:59.750 --> 17:02.542
I want to switch to OB,
but Bailey said it's a bad time.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.583
Ah, she's not wrong there.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.834
Thank you.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.041
Listen, everything will sort itself out
once Grey's back on her feet.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.667
<i>If </i>she gets back on her feet.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.417
Well, I thought she was on the mend.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.041
We all did.

17:14.417 --> 17:15.959
Well, how bad is it?

17:16.834 --> 17:19.625
Her liver enzymes
are elevated this morning,

17:19.709 --> 17:21.000
and her creatinine is worse,

17:21.083 --> 17:25.250
so her kidneys could be failing,
and nobody knows why.

17:25.667 --> 17:27.834
God, it's just one thing
after another, isn't it?

17:27.917 --> 17:31.000
This is my way of remembering
that there is more to the world

17:31.083 --> 17:33.875
than just misery and death.

17:33.959 --> 17:35.458
At least, I hope there is.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.583
I'll get out of your way.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.375
[Monitor beeping]

17:46.250 --> 17:48.250
[Richard] Tell me you found something.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.875
[Sighs] Meredith's chest CT was clear.

17:50.959 --> 17:53.333
However, her abdominal CT wasn't.

17:53.417 --> 17:56.542
We found a filling defect
in her IVC and hepatic vein.

17:56.625 --> 17:58.000
And is that clot in her liver?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.917
Yes, which explains
why she can't stay awake.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.875
Her body's fighting a build-up of ammonia.

18:01.959 --> 18:05.125
It's a small clot, but
if we don't treat it quickly,

18:05.208 --> 18:06.583
then there could be fluid build-up,

18:06.667 --> 18:08.709
which will just wreak havoc on her liver.

18:08.792 --> 18:11.583
Can you do, uh, an IR shunt
or thrombolytics, or --

18:11.667 --> 18:13.875
A TIPS procedure should be done
in the IR suite, for sure,

18:13.959 --> 18:16.041
but I don't think I should do it.

18:16.125 --> 18:17.250
Why not?

18:17.333 --> 18:19.208
Because Dr. Altman's here,

18:19.291 --> 18:22.125
and because Dr. Grey is Maggie's sister,

18:22.208 --> 18:25.208
-and if anything --
-Dr. Altman...

18:25.291 --> 18:27.542
are you sure you're up to this?

18:29.333 --> 18:30.458
It's a simple procedure.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.417
I know what it is.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.750
I'm asking, are you --

18:33.834 --> 18:35.458
I will book an IR suite.

18:36.625 --> 18:37.750
Altman...

18:40.000 --> 18:41.333
...are you sure?

18:42.375 --> 18:44.542
Meredith doesn't have time
for this conversation.

18:52.125 --> 18:53.375
-[Monitor beeping]
-[Door closes]

18:53.458 --> 18:54.583
[Owen] Hey.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.083
Webber send you to check in on me?

18:56.166 --> 18:57.583
No. No, he told me what was going on

18:57.667 --> 18:59.500
and asked me if we thought
you were okay to operate.

18:59.583 --> 19:01.917
-And?
-And I told him you were fine to operate

19:02.000 --> 19:04.417
-and there was no one better to do it.
-Thank you.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.583
And I also told him
that if something goes wrong,

19:06.667 --> 19:07.792
either something within your control
