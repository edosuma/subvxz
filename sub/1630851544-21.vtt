WEBVTT

00:01.610 --> 00:04.613
Previously onSWAT...Hank St. John. I go by Saint.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.093
It's always good to get drugs
off the streets,

00:06.136 --> 00:07.572
but if you're right about
this Saint guy being

00:07.616 --> 00:09.009
behind all this...I am.

00:09.052 --> 00:10.401
They didn't find anything
to link it to Saint.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.055
We're putting
a financial hurt on him

00:12.099 --> 00:13.491
and he's got to be feeling
the pressure.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.189
It's only gonna take one mistake
for the LAPD

00:15.232 --> 00:16.190
to come knocking
on your door.

00:16.233 --> 00:17.930
And I'll be watching you.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.194
I want us to just do

00:20.237 --> 00:22.152
whatever we have to do
to make things work.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.327
I want us to be together.

00:23.371 --> 00:24.807
And now,
with you leaving SWAT,

00:24.850 --> 00:25.938
we can be.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.375
Oh, my God.Chris, hey.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.290
Tell me you don't love me.
Just say it.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.465
I can't do this.

00:30.508 --> 00:32.119
Okay.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.816
You know what? I'm done.

00:45.349 --> 00:46.568
Your tutor's gonna be here soon.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.135
Game over. Turn it off.

00:49.223 --> 00:50.441
Adam,
take off the headphones!

00:52.182 --> 00:53.618
What the hell, Mom?

00:53.662 --> 00:56.404
SAT prep or no car.
We made a deal.

00:56.447 --> 00:57.970
Yeah,
like I had much of a choice.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.233
I don't even want to go
to college.

00:59.276 --> 01:00.451
Dad didn't.

01:00.495 --> 01:02.497
Rick, could you get in here?

01:02.540 --> 01:04.020
I'm in school all week.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.326
Okay? I'm not gonna waste
my weekend prepping

01:05.369 --> 01:07.241
for some dumbass test.Fine.

01:07.284 --> 01:10.505
Then no car,
and no car means no Kimberly.

01:10.548 --> 01:11.549
I can't hear you.

01:11.593 --> 01:12.942
God, you're the worst.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.336
Power failure.

01:15.379 --> 01:17.903
Security system disabled.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.122
Again?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.254
I should just put
the power company

01:20.297 --> 01:21.733
on speed dial.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.388
Mom!

01:26.129 --> 01:27.478
There's cash in my purse
in the kitchen.

01:27.522 --> 01:28.784
Take it and go!

01:28.827 --> 01:29.872
Oh, my God!

01:29.915 --> 01:31.047
What do you want?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.615
The statues. Where are they?

01:33.658 --> 01:34.703
The what?Hey, don't touch her!

01:39.316 --> 01:40.883
These statues.

01:40.926 --> 01:42.102
Those are
Rick's family heirlooms.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.016
I've no idea where they are.Shut up.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.801
Where is your husband?

01:45.844 --> 01:47.150
At work.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.463
Leroy.

01:55.506 --> 01:56.768
Come on in.

02:00.032 --> 02:01.251
What's wrong?
You all right?

02:01.295 --> 02:03.732
Uh, I would've called,
but my phone died.

02:03.775 --> 02:06.648
I was sitting in the hospital
waiting room all night.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.563
Wait a minute. Darryl okay?Yeah, yeah.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.173
D's good, man. I-I was there

02:10.217 --> 02:12.001
waiting on word
about Becca Irwin.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.655
Jerry Irwin's little girl.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.961
Not so little anymore.
She's 21.

02:16.005 --> 02:19.617
Before Jerry died last year,
he asked me to look out for her.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.490
I got a strange call from her,
middle of the night.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.362
So I went to her place,
and I found her half dead, man.

02:25.406 --> 02:28.017
Well, what happened?Something with the brain, man.

02:28.060 --> 02:29.453
I mean, drug-induced.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.194
Now, Becca, she's a,
she's a quiet girl,

02:31.238 --> 02:32.848
a good girl, man.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.545
And how's she been holding up
since she lost her pops?

02:34.589 --> 02:37.244
I-It seemed like
she was making it through.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.985
But then the phone call,
and she was messed up.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.205
Talking crazy,
like she lost her mind.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.033
You got any idea
what kind of drug she got into?

02:47.645 --> 02:50.779
I found it on the floor
by her nightstand.

02:50.822 --> 02:52.302
Not sure what it is.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.304
Figured someone you work with
might know.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.525
Do you know
who Hank St. John is?

02:57.568 --> 02:59.004
Folks call him Saint.

02:59.048 --> 03:00.571
Older guy from the islands.Yeah. Yeah.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.834
Active in the community.Yeah, I seen him around.

03:02.878 --> 03:04.488
Do you think it's possible
that Becca was connected

03:04.532 --> 03:05.968
to anyone
who runs in his circle?

03:06.011 --> 03:07.578
No clue, man. Look.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.624
I-If you know who's
putting this crap out there,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.321
then we can find out
who did this to her.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.323
I don't know anything right now,

03:13.367 --> 03:14.629
but l-let me run this
by some people.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.283
For now, you just sit tight.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.632
We'll get to
the bottom of this.

03:19.938 --> 03:22.419
Nice.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.595
Ooh. You know, most officers
who put in their notice

03:24.639 --> 03:26.989
take their foot off the gas
the last couple weeks.

03:27.032 --> 03:29.165
Most of 'em have
20 years on me.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.427
Yeah, she's just nervous.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.124
She might be leaving SWAT,
but she knows

03:32.168 --> 03:34.214
she's still on the hook
for our weekend workouts.

03:34.257 --> 03:36.564
And the second
she starts slowing down,

03:36.607 --> 03:38.653
gonna cut her loose.Keep dreaming.

03:38.696 --> 03:39.915
Truth is,
if I'm gonna be any help

03:39.958 --> 03:41.221
to the women of the safe house,

03:41.264 --> 03:42.700
I can't let myself get soft.

03:42.744 --> 03:44.049
It still doesn't seem real.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.703
Guys, I'm leaving SWAT,
not dying.

03:46.530 --> 03:47.923
Hey, how'd you do
on the ropes out there?

03:47.966 --> 03:49.359
Who beat who to the top?

03:49.403 --> 03:51.274
I won.
Pretty sure I got him.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.580
You can't be serious.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.234
Maybe it was a tie.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.539
Whatever you need
to tell yourself

03:55.583 --> 03:56.932
to sleep in the night, kid.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.368
That's it, Chris.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.849
So, no senioritis
for you, huh?

04:00.892 --> 04:02.024
You guys just want me
to sit on my ass

04:02.067 --> 04:03.504
and eat bonbons all day,
right?

04:03.547 --> 04:04.635
Hey, when I pull the ripcord,

04:04.679 --> 04:05.767
that's where I plan to start.

04:06.942 --> 04:09.292
Hey, been meaning to ask you,

04:09.336 --> 04:10.902
how'd it go last weekend
with that Darcy girl?

04:10.946 --> 04:12.513
Honestly,

04:12.556 --> 04:14.166
it was like...

04:14.210 --> 04:15.646
the most relaxed I've been
on a date in a long time.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.952
Okay, so there's
something there?

04:16.995 --> 04:18.388
Are you gonna
see her again?

04:18.432 --> 04:20.129
I'm actually seeing her tonight.No kidding?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.478
Yeah, yeah.That's great, man.
All right.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.653
Come on, Tan.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.351
Let's go. Round four.

04:24.394 --> 04:26.657
Go. 20 more, let's go.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.529
Let's work it. Quick.

04:33.403 --> 04:34.665
Don't make this so hard
on yourself.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.624
Give us the code to the safe.

04:36.667 --> 04:38.234
I'm not giving you the code.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.931
Once you have
what you want,

04:39.975 --> 04:41.324
you're gonna kill us.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.419
You expecting company?

04:49.463 --> 04:50.725
Hmm?

04:50.768 --> 04:52.596
My son's tutor.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.816
She won't stick around.

04:54.859 --> 04:58.123
Make a sound
and you get a bullet.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.478
Shh...

05:18.318 --> 05:19.928
I'm in.

05:19.971 --> 05:22.452
Ah, it was only
a matter of time.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.024
There's no statues in here.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.640
Help! Somebody help us!

05:36.684 --> 05:38.947
911. What's your emergency?

05:38.990 --> 05:41.297
I'm right outside
2664 Good Shepherd Lane.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.385
I heard gunshots
inside the house,

05:42.429 --> 05:43.734
and now I hear people screaming.

06:27.865 --> 06:29.519
It's clear.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.569
STREET
Somebody tore this place apart.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.179
Looks like a robbery.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.485
Not a very good one.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.270
There's a purse with
a wallet full of cash.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.240
This is 20-David.
We have a DOA.

06:55.284 --> 06:57.895
Male adult. GSW to the chest.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.339
Two more DOAs

07:07.383 --> 07:08.993
in the family room.

07:09.037 --> 07:10.821
Female adult and male teen.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.084
They're tied up.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.999
They were executed.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.481
Check out the portrait.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.743
20-David, listen up.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.266
Possible female juvenile
unaccounted for.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.399
I repeat, there may be a child
on the premises.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.804
Bathroom clear.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.936
Tan.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.992
If there's anyone hiding
in here,

07:51.035 --> 07:52.515
you can come out now,
you're safe.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.299
We're policemen.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.956
Hey.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.741
Hey, it's all right,
it's all right.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.354
Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

08:09.097 --> 08:11.186
Hey, I'm Tan.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.536
This is my friend Hondo.
We're here to help.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.407
You think you can come out?

08:15.451 --> 08:17.932
You can trust us,
I promise.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.637
20-Squad, we have the girl.

08:27.681 --> 08:30.466
She appears to be
physically unharmed.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.560
What's the poor girl's name?Caitlin.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.822
Once Tan got her outside,

08:38.866 --> 08:40.258
she broke down crying
for her dog.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.521
We couldn't find it
anywhere.

08:41.564 --> 08:42.870
Must've escaped
in the chaos.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.480
On top of everything else.
What a nightmare.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.482
Where's Caitlin now?The social worker.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.310
They're bringing her here
while her grandma flies out

08:48.353 --> 08:50.399
from New York.All right, let's see
that we get her set up

08:50.442 --> 08:52.575
and make it
as comfortable as possible.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.231
Were we able to salvage anything

08:56.274 --> 08:57.885
from the Weaver
home security system?Just this,

08:57.928 --> 08:59.713
right before
the killers cut the power.

08:59.756 --> 09:02.542
Looks like a
damn hit squad.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.021
Wipe out a family in cold blood.

09:04.065 --> 09:05.588
Man, it's hard
to understand why.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.981
They ransacked the house,

09:07.024 --> 09:08.504
left behind valuables
in an open safe.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.505
They're after
something specific,

09:09.549 --> 09:10.506
we just don't know what.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.247
Hey, maybe we do.

09:12.290 --> 09:13.596
Get this.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.816
The killers searched
Weaver's computer

09:15.859 --> 09:17.992
for any files they could find
tied to these statues.

09:18.035 --> 09:19.907
What the hell am I looking at?These are three of

09:19.950 --> 09:21.822
the most valuable
porcelain statues in the world.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.911
Part of an ancient
Chinese zodiac set.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.390
600 years old,

09:25.434 --> 09:27.131
once owned by an emperor
in the Ming Dynasty.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.872
So how valuable we talking?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.439
Between $30 and $35 million.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.440
Each.

09:31.483 --> 09:32.659
For those things?

09:32.702 --> 09:34.182
Money like that,

09:34.225 --> 09:36.010
I'd get each one of them
their own security detail.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.794
They wouldn't just be sitting
at home for the taking.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.535
Well, that's the thing.
They were never in the house

09:39.579 --> 09:40.928
to begin with.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.364
Detectives scoured
Weaver's business email,

09:42.407 --> 09:44.192
and the hedge fund he ran
was insolvent.

09:44.235 --> 09:45.715
Last month,
he quietly sold these pieces off

09:45.759 --> 09:47.064
to raise capital.

09:47.108 --> 09:48.588
So, this family,
they died for nothing.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.067
Yeah.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.852
Do we know who
Weaver sold the statues to?

09:51.895 --> 09:53.941
It was all done
under the radar, no PR.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.638
Some antiquities dealer
named Eli Gibbs

09:55.682 --> 09:57.031
brokered the private sales.

09:57.074 --> 09:58.728
"Sales" as there's
more than one?

09:58.772 --> 09:59.816
There's a good chance
that these pieces are

09:59.860 --> 10:01.339
in three separate locations.

10:01.383 --> 10:02.993
Which means, the new owners,
whoever they are,

10:03.037 --> 10:04.778
they're in danger.And so is anyone
in its vicinity.

10:04.821 --> 10:06.170
Pick up this broker,
Eli Gibbs.

10:06.214 --> 10:08.390
Bring him in.
We need to talk to him.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.785
Detective Rios.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.264
You see my text?

10:14.526 --> 10:15.702
That's the same label
that we saw

10:15.745 --> 10:16.659
in the stash house
last month.

10:16.703 --> 10:17.791
Mm-hmm.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.488
That means Saint already has

10:19.531 --> 10:20.837
a new pill mill up and running.I called the hospital

10:20.881 --> 10:22.186
when I got your message.

10:22.230 --> 10:23.448
Becca Irwin's tox screen
came back positive

10:23.492 --> 10:26.016
for A.N.I.
What's A.N.I.?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.496
All Night Insanity,

10:27.539 --> 10:29.585
a new stimulant
big on local campuses.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
Seen more students OD
in the past ten days

10:31.674 --> 10:33.589
than the two months prior.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.678
Yeah, lab thinks it's cut
with an oven cleaner.

10:35.722 --> 10:38.289
Can cause irreversible damage
to the nervous system.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.117
We have no idea
where it's being manufactured.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.466
Well, whoever's
making this stuff,

10:41.510 --> 10:42.511
you know the road
leads back to Saint.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.817
Yeah, and you know

10:43.860 --> 10:45.601
until we have hard proof
Saint's involved,

10:45.645 --> 10:46.820
there's nothing we can do.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.169
We've been putting
the hurt on him,

10:48.212 --> 10:49.431
hitting his stash houses.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.215
He's desperate for cash.

10:51.259 --> 10:52.782
We got to make a move on him
now, while he's vulnerable.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.218
And just what kind of move
do you have in mind?

10:54.262 --> 10:55.698
If Saint thought

10:55.742 --> 10:57.004
the cops were closing in,
putting together a case,

10:57.047 --> 10:58.875
he might try
to offload product fast,

10:58.919 --> 11:00.703
take risks that
he normally wouldn't take.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.574
I think it's time
someone pay Saint a visit.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.447
My boss'd have my head if I got
within 30 yards of that guy.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.449
Well, it's a good thing
I don't answer to your boss.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.452
Good luck.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.671
Maybe something will
shake loose.

11:16.719 --> 11:19.069
Hi.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.028
Has she said anything
more about the dog?

11:21.071 --> 11:23.900
No. She hasn't spoken
since we left the house.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.424
All I managed to pick up is
that the dog's name is Sammie

11:26.468 --> 11:27.774
and she just got it recently.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.211
Am I okay to talk
to her yet?

11:30.254 --> 11:32.256
Just try to stick
to simple questions.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.089
Hi, Caitlin.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.396
Do you remember me
from the house? I'm Tan.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.832
I'd like to know more
about your dog, Sammie.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.054
Can you tell me
what color Sammie is?

11:49.099 --> 11:50.405
Is it all right if we share

11:50.448 --> 11:52.320
some of your artwork
with him, sweetie?

11:58.065 --> 12:00.371
I know it's not
much to go on.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.592
It's somewhere to start.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.814
Look here.

12:07.857 --> 12:10.164
You want knight
to queen's bishop two.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.687
You see?

12:11.731 --> 12:14.472
But you were about to do that
anyway, weren't you?

12:18.128 --> 12:19.826
Excuse me.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.877
It's been a while,
Sergeant.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.531
Doesn't really feel like it.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.793
Maybe 'cause I hear your name
around the office.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.490
You drop by for a lesson?

12:32.534 --> 12:34.275
I'm good.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.233
Well, there's still time.

12:38.322 --> 12:40.020
I'm curious, Saint.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.980
You know any pill mills
around here cashing in

12:44.024 --> 12:46.069
while kids
from South L.A. are landing

12:46.113 --> 12:48.811
in a hospital or morgue?

12:48.855 --> 12:50.987
You think you can rattle me
by coming here?

12:51.031 --> 12:53.250
I don't embarrass so easily.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.382
That's not what this is.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.600
What is it then?

12:55.644 --> 12:56.645
I'm here because
a young woman I know

12:56.688 --> 12:57.907
is in the ICU from a drug

12:57.951 --> 12:59.953
that your operations are
responsible for.

12:59.996 --> 13:02.738
You must have me confused
with someone.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.827
I'm sorry to hear about
your friend, Sergeant.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.350
But where I come from,

13:06.394 --> 13:08.396
people are responsible

13:08.439 --> 13:10.093
for what they put
in their own bodies.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.834
Even young women.

13:11.878 --> 13:13.705
Consider it
a fair warming.

13:13.749 --> 13:14.968
Clean up your act,
or you're gonna see me

13:15.011 --> 13:17.361
in ways that you don't want to.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.191
Deacon and Street are
on their way back

13:21.235 --> 13:22.758
from the antiquities
dealer's place.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.325
They found it turned
upside down,

13:24.368 --> 13:26.414
no sign of Eli Gibbs.You think he skipped town?

13:26.457 --> 13:28.720
Not sure. A neighbor saw him
leave in a hurry,

13:28.764 --> 13:31.114
said five men showed up
a few minutes later.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.029
Gibbs may have escaped
with his life.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.465
He must've heard of
the Weaver family

13:34.509 --> 13:36.076
and assumed he'd be next.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.947
Well, you got to figure
even high-end brokers only deal

13:37.991 --> 13:40.167
in so many $30-million statues.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.691
What did the killers manage
to get out of his place?

13:42.734 --> 13:44.127
A desktop, two hard drives,

13:44.171 --> 13:45.868
and they emptied
his filing cabinets.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.565
Won't be long before they
figure out who has the statues

13:47.609 --> 13:48.871
and start hitting them
one by one.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.481
Any idea
where Gibbs might've gone?

13:50.525 --> 13:52.353
No, but we may not be
completely out of luck.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.833
An art appraiser
who works with Gibbs

13:53.876 --> 13:55.486
called his landline
while we were there.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.401
She started to leave a message,
so I picked up.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.882
She's agreed to come talk to us.
Should be here any minute.

13:59.926 --> 14:02.885
Spoke to Detective Barlow
in art theft. Listen to this.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.366
Two statues
from the very same zodiac set

14:05.409 --> 14:08.108
were stolen three days ago
from a gallery in London.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.326
Must be the same crew.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.675
So, what's the theory?

14:10.719 --> 14:11.938
Foreign collector's
making a move?

14:11.981 --> 14:13.678
Yeah, it's Barlow's
best guess.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.767
She said Chinese oligarchs
have been known

14:15.811 --> 14:19.206
to repatriate lost cultural
pieces by any means necessary.

14:19.249 --> 14:21.599
Well, if these are the same
guys, they traveled here fast.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.863
I want passenger manifests
for every flight

14:23.906 --> 14:25.299
from London
in the past three days.

14:25.342 --> 14:26.648
Airlines, charters.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.997
Anything you can find.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.172
It's her.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.260
This is Sergeant Kay.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.827
Sergeant, this is Jane Lucas.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.785
Yeah, I'm coming to meet you.
You out front?

14:33.829 --> 14:35.613
Uh, n-no.

14:35.657 --> 14:37.528
I had second thoughts about
coming down there. I'm sorry.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.052
After what happened
to that family,

14:39.095 --> 14:41.315
I don't want to be involved
in any of this.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.707
Yeah.Like I said,

14:42.751 --> 14:44.144
I don't work in-house
for Mr. Gibbs.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.580
He only calls me in
to appraise a piece

14:45.623 --> 14:46.755
if it's of
a particularly high quality.

14:46.798 --> 14:48.626
No, I understand.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.150
But that's why I wanted
to talk to you.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.412
We're looking for the statues

14:51.455 --> 14:52.804
that Rick Weaver put up
for sale.

14:52.848 --> 14:53.980
Do you know
who Gibbs sold them to?

14:54.023 --> 14:55.720
Not their names.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.940
No, he-- I think he mentioned
one of them was a doctor,

14:57.984 --> 14:59.899
but they were both
private sales.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.988
Wat. Wait, wait. "Both"?

15:02.031 --> 15:04.033
There were two sales?
But there are three statues.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.426
If two were sold,
where's the third?

15:05.469 --> 15:06.775
I don't know.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.298
I would imagine
it's still sitting

15:08.342 --> 15:10.213
in the safe deposit box
at Mr. Gibbs's bank.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.780
Do you have idea
where he kept that key?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.367
Silent alarm tripped
at15 hours

15:33.410 --> 15:34.977
when four gunmen
entered the bank.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.022
Unis got the perimeter cleared.

15:36.065 --> 15:37.545
We have visual
on the suspects?

15:37.588 --> 15:39.634
Description matches the crew
from the Weaver home.

15:39.677 --> 15:42.289
Any shots fired inside?Not yet,
but judging by their MO...

15:42.332 --> 15:43.768
Luca,

15:43.812 --> 15:44.944
we got to get there
before they escape.

15:44.987 --> 15:45.857
'kay,
doing my best.

15:47.033 --> 15:48.208
Street, what're you,
taking your first steps?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.559
Here.
I got it. I'm good.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.570
Please don't shoot!

16:02.613 --> 16:04.093
I'm a teller.How many suspects inside?

16:04.137 --> 16:06.226
There were four.Turn around. Turn around.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.880
Hands behind your back.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.752
Put your hands behind your back!

16:11.840 --> 16:13.320
Whoa, whoa, woah.
Hey, hey, whoa.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.408
Whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

16:14.451 --> 16:16.671
Take it, take it easy.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.717
Easy. Easy.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.205
Put down your weapon!

16:30.380 --> 16:32.600
Let the officer go!

16:32.643 --> 16:34.689
We can end this
without anyone getting hurt.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.040
Go, go, go, go, go!

16:40.608 --> 16:42.218
Street, you're with me.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.543
22-David, suspects are heading
down the alley.

17:10.203 --> 17:11.421
LAPD!Everybody down!

17:18.428 --> 17:20.343
Are you okay?

17:24.043 --> 17:25.566
Give it up.

17:26.697 --> 17:28.482
26-David. Runner in custody.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.109
22-David, we lost them.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.374
Any hits on the BOLO we put out?

17:51.418 --> 17:52.854
Getaway van's still MIA.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.639
Things got
a little tense earlier

17:55.683 --> 17:56.814
between you and Street.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.338
Just that kind
of day, I guess.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.819
Look,

18:01.863 --> 18:03.256
I don't know
how to say this...

18:03.299 --> 18:05.040
Just say it.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.390
I know about you and Street.
That you guys have...

18:07.434 --> 18:09.784
Well, you had a situation.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.439
Exactly what did he say?

18:12.482 --> 18:14.180
Nothing, I figured it out
on my own.

18:14.223 --> 18:16.573
Before things took a weird turn,

18:16.617 --> 18:17.835
you were coming over
to the house a lot,

18:17.879 --> 18:19.315
like, all the time.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.882
You guys had
all these inside jokes.

18:20.925 --> 18:24.190
And Street's dimples were more,
like, dimply

18:24.233 --> 18:25.930
when you were around.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.019
You're seeing something
that isn't there.

18:28.063 --> 18:31.022
Come on. I know you,
and I know Street.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.068
You two together, it works.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.504
Okay, you know what?
We're done here.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.854
Yeah, never let them get
too close, right, Chris?

18:38.595 --> 18:40.293
Meaning?

18:41.337 --> 18:43.470
When I see someone I care about
royally screwing up,

18:43.513 --> 18:45.167
I got to say something.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.777
When you guys were
on the same squad,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.301
I get why it didn't work.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.520
But now you're leaving.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.174
And instead of going all in,

18:52.218 --> 18:53.436
you're letting the best thing
that ever happened to you

18:53.480 --> 18:54.742
slip away because you're too...

18:54.785 --> 18:56.222
Stubborn?

18:56.265 --> 18:57.919
Yeah, I heard that before.

18:57.962 --> 18:59.616
No, you're not stubborn.
You're scared.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.098
Chris, you keep everyone
at a distance

19:03.142 --> 19:04.969
like it's an insurance policy
on not getting hurt.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.449
But you can't go through life
like that

19:06.493 --> 19:08.234
and expect to ever really live.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.758
What you and Street have...

19:10.801 --> 19:14.283
the risk of getting hurt,

19:14.327 --> 19:16.285
that is nothing compared

19:16.329 --> 19:19.723
to the pain of
never experiencing it.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.946
I'’m gonna say this
with love, Luca.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.297
Keep your nose out of
my business, okay?

19:33.520 --> 19:36.044
Hey. How's Becca holding up?

19:36.087 --> 19:38.220
In a damn coma,
that's how.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.787
No telling when
she's gonna wake up.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.267
Could be hours,
could be days.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.225
Any word on Saint?

19:43.269 --> 19:44.661
I went by to see him.

19:44.705 --> 19:46.533
You went by to see him?

19:46.576 --> 19:48.230
And that visit didn't end
with his ass

19:48.274 --> 19:49.623
in the back seat
of your cruiser?

19:49.666 --> 19:51.059
No, Leroy, it didn't.

19:51.102 --> 19:52.103
I can't just go "street justice"

19:52.147 --> 19:53.670
on people I don't like.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.237
Yeah, well, you tell that
to the 21-year-old girl

19:55.281 --> 19:56.456
breathing through tubes,

19:56.499 --> 19:58.153
fighting for her life.Leroy.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.763
I hear you, man. I do.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.244
But right now, we ain't got
nothing to pin on Saint.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
He knows we're watching him,
so there's a strong chance

20:04.290 --> 20:05.769
he's gonna move product fast.

20:05.813 --> 20:07.293
We wait
until he makes that move,

20:07.336 --> 20:08.685
and then hopefully
we catch him in a mistake.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.339
Not good or fast enough.

20:10.383 --> 20:11.514
Well, that ain't
your call to make.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.037
No.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.126
Then again,

20:15.170 --> 20:19.000
see, I don't work
within the confines of a badge.

20:19.043 --> 20:22.308
See, I talked to
some old contacts,

20:22.351 --> 20:24.223
like I'm looking
to get back in the game.

20:24.266 --> 20:27.313
Eventually, that led me
to Saint's number one dealer.

20:27.356 --> 20:28.792
Cat named Damone.

20:28.836 --> 20:30.968
I get in good with him,

20:31.012 --> 20:32.361
we get Saint.

20:32.405 --> 20:33.754
We're meeting today.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.146
Like hell you are.

20:35.190 --> 20:36.147
That would mean
that you interfering

20:36.191 --> 20:37.148
in a police investigation.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.585
What investigation?

20:38.628 --> 20:40.761
Police ain't doing a damn thing,
so I am.

20:40.804 --> 20:44.155
Look, your association with me
does not give you immunity.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.593
You're gonna get yourself
caught up all over again

20:46.636 --> 20:48.116
and find yourself
back in a six-by-eight box.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.726
Then get me the immunity.

20:49.770 --> 20:52.599
Make me a CI or something
on this, man, come on.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.905
Yeah.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.386
Yeah.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.910
Almost forgot about
your little trust issues.

21:01.260 --> 21:05.699
I'm going to that meeting
with or without you.

21:05.742 --> 21:08.702
Least I could do for someone
who was like a brother to me.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.185
Still no hits on the BOLO,

21:14.229 --> 21:15.970
and our suspect hasn't
uttered a word.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.406
Tell me you got something.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.712
You were right.
Suspects flew into L.A.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.104
from the U.K.
three days ago.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.758
Just got ahold of
the manifest

21:21.802 --> 21:23.369
and ID'd five of our thieves.

21:23.412 --> 21:25.327
They're all ex-soldiers of
the Bosnian Armed Forces.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.155
This guy is the head honcho,

21:27.198 --> 21:29.244
Maxim Baranov.
He was a lieutenant

21:29.288 --> 21:32.116
with the army's Tactical
Support Brigade in Sarajevo.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.336
He recruited four of
his army buddies here,

21:34.380 --> 21:36.338
and they started hiring out
services to bad actors.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.992
Yeah, let's get those IDs
out to patrol.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.341
I want to put a collar
on these guys

21:39.385 --> 21:40.951
before they hurt anyone else.Okay.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.392
How much longer
till you stop icing me out?

21:47.567 --> 21:49.264
Uh, I don't know,
how much longer

21:49.308 --> 21:51.266
till you're not working here
anymore?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.224
I never meant to hurt you.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.752
You really must think
I'm stupid.

21:58.795 --> 22:00.710
You never meant to hurt me?

22:00.754 --> 22:01.798
You did.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.278
And you know you did.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.106
Street, that's not fair.Just stop.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.762
You already made me feel
like a fool.

22:08.805 --> 22:12.635
We don't need to keep doing it
over and over again.

22:12.679 --> 22:13.636
Okay?

22:13.680 --> 22:16.247
I'm done talking about this.

22:19.163 --> 22:20.991
You want to use Leroy as a CI?

22:22.819 --> 22:24.386
You really think this through?Sir,

22:24.430 --> 22:26.432
if he can establish a strong
relationship with Damone--

22:26.475 --> 22:27.955
which I believe he can--

22:27.998 --> 22:29.826
he'll make inroads
into Saint's drug ring.

22:29.870 --> 22:30.914
And then,
once we get enough evidence

22:30.958 --> 22:31.959
linking Damone to Saint,

22:32.002 --> 22:33.308
we flip him.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.483
Well,
judging by the stash houses,

22:34.527 --> 22:36.137
Saint's extremely cautious.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.530
And let's not forget

22:37.573 --> 22:39.227
his spotless reputation
in the community.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.098
It's a reputation based on lies.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.273
Sir, this might be
our only chance to build

22:42.317 --> 22:43.492
a watertight case
against Saint,

22:43.536 --> 22:45.059
with a key witness to boot.

22:45.102 --> 22:47.670
This isn't
what SWAT's supposed to do.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.498
Our job's saving lives,
Commander.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.370
And right now there's
a young girl in the hospital

22:51.413 --> 22:52.719
fighting for hers
because of Saint's drugs.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.329
And she won't be the last.

22:54.373 --> 22:55.852
Using Leroy as a CI is tricky

22:55.896 --> 22:57.506
given your history with him.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.466
You sure you can trust him
to do the job

23:00.509 --> 23:01.771
that LAPD would
expect him to do?

23:01.815 --> 23:02.946
Without any hard feelings,

23:02.990 --> 23:04.948
without any agenda
of his own?

23:04.992 --> 23:06.297
He's our best option.

23:06.341 --> 23:07.647
And by "best,"

23:07.690 --> 23:10.084
I mean our only option.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.390
Yes.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.261
I think Leroy's
up for the job.

23:13.304 --> 23:14.871
Not what I asked.

23:14.915 --> 23:16.351
But I trust you,

23:16.395 --> 23:18.048
so I'll approve it.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.835
Thank you, sir.You're welcome.

23:23.140 --> 23:24.490
Caitlin.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.580
I'd like you to meet
a good friend of mine.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.843
His name is Lobo.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.455
Lobo means "wolf."

23:33.499 --> 23:35.805
That's right.
How'd you know that?

23:36.850 --> 23:39.853
My school teaches us
English and Spanish.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.204
Do you like your school?

23:43.247 --> 23:46.512
They give us a lot of homework.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.862
Does your dog hang out with you
when you do your homework?

23:48.905 --> 23:51.473
You mean Sammie?

23:52.735 --> 23:55.172
Is Sammie a girl dog
or a boy dog?

23:56.173 --> 23:57.479
Girl.

23:59.568 --> 24:01.483
But she's not real.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.486
My brother won her for me
at a fair.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.749
So Sammie's a stuffed animal.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.143
Yeah, my favorite one.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.492
That's why,

24:10.536 --> 24:14.540
when I heard those men
in the house,

24:14.583 --> 24:16.237
I hid her.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.850
Tell me where she is,
maybe I can go get her for you.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.331
Hey, Tan.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.550
Need you in here, buddy.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.073
Okay. See you later, Caitlin.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.291
Say bye, buddy.

24:27.335 --> 24:28.597
Come on, pup.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.120
Let's go, buddy.

24:30.164 --> 24:32.166
Okay, when Deac talked
to the appraiser,

24:32.209 --> 24:33.646
she said one of the
buyers was a doctor.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.082
So detectives
did a deep dive

24:35.125 --> 24:36.649
into what was left
of Gibbs's place.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.128
Here's one of the guys
they flagged.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.348
Alan Gordon,
but he's not an MD.

24:40.391 --> 24:42.698
PhD. Professor at Hudson College
right here in L.A.

24:42.742 --> 24:44.047
Check out his bio.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.571
A chair of
the Art Department

24:45.614 --> 24:47.094
and leading expert
on East Asian Art History.

24:47.137 --> 24:48.530
That can't be a coincidence.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.923
Yup, but how the hell

24:49.966 --> 24:51.272
could a college professor afford

24:51.315 --> 24:52.882
a piece worth 35 mil?He couldn't,

24:52.926 --> 24:54.101
but the school could.

24:54.144 --> 24:55.319
It looks like
the Art Department has

24:55.363 --> 24:56.712
a multi-million-dollar
endowment.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.627
Our getaway van busted through
a security gate

24:58.671 --> 25:00.107
at Hudson College.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.500
20-Squad's up.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.141
LAPD! Don't move!

25:38.014 --> 25:40.539
30-David, in foot pursuit.I got this one!

25:42.236 --> 25:43.367
Give me your hands!

25:49.765 --> 25:51.114
Whoa, uh, hey!

26:03.910 --> 26:05.781
Give me your hands!

26:06.956 --> 26:08.915
26-David, one suspect

26:08.958 --> 26:10.003
in custody.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.701
Hey!

26:20.970 --> 26:22.755
Don't move!

26:22.798 --> 26:24.234
Don't move.

26:24.278 --> 26:25.627
You're done.

26:25.671 --> 26:26.846
We got him.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.458
Street, you good?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.157
Am I seriously looking at

26:34.201 --> 26:36.116
$30 million worth
of broken porcelain?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.726
Hope it's insured.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.040
You're not gonna believe this.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.563
That statue that broke?
It was fake.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.043
I just spoke
to Detective Barlow.

26:50.086 --> 26:51.784
Their forensics lab confirmed
that there's no way

26:51.827 --> 26:53.786
those porcelain fragments
are 600 years old.

26:53.829 --> 26:56.179
You think the statues Weaver had
were ever real to begin with?

26:56.223 --> 26:57.877
That's a good question.
Who knows?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.574
But the killers think so.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.054
What about you?

27:01.097 --> 27:02.403
Any luck tracking down
that antiquities dealer?

27:02.446 --> 27:04.187
Nah, Gibbs went MIA,
probably hiding.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.450
Gibbs' art appraiser,
she's got some explaining to do.

27:06.494 --> 27:07.930
I just sent unis out
to pick her up.

27:08.931 --> 27:09.976
Hey.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.022
I think Street's gonna be
a little lost

27:13.066 --> 27:14.633
without you around.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.548
We're all gonna miss you, Chris.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.820
Whoo! Bullseye, baby!

27:28.908 --> 27:30.474
Trying to tell you, man.

27:30.518 --> 27:31.998
Whoo!

27:32.041 --> 27:34.217
Hey, you must be,
uh, Damone.

27:34.261 --> 27:35.479
I haven't played this game
in a minute,

27:35.523 --> 27:37.438
and I'm already killing it.

27:37.481 --> 27:38.787
You play?

27:41.137 --> 27:43.400
Uh, I've been out of the game
for a minute

27:43.444 --> 27:45.098
and a lot's changed.

27:45.141 --> 27:48.057
But I know the basics
of talking shop face-to-face,

27:48.101 --> 27:50.146
minus
the corny-ass distractions.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.800
So, come on, young blood.

27:51.844 --> 27:54.760
Do us both a favor
and stop wasting my time.

27:54.803 --> 27:57.197
All right, old man.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.417
Plead your case.

28:00.461 --> 28:02.463
Judging by
your little power trip,

28:02.506 --> 28:04.421
I take it you checked me out,
so you know

28:04.465 --> 28:07.120
that when I was in it,
I was damn good at it.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.599
Yeah, till you got busted.

28:08.643 --> 28:10.123
Yeah, that's right.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.603
Because I kept my mouth shut.
I did the time

28:12.647 --> 28:14.214
instead of selling out.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.956
But you want back in?
That's it?

28:16.999 --> 28:19.088
Uh, what happened
to that reentry life?

28:19.132 --> 28:20.742
You know, I tried it.

28:20.786 --> 28:24.398
But that second chance noise
is just noise, homey.

28:24.441 --> 28:26.879
And I'm drowning.

28:26.922 --> 28:29.708
Do I want back in? Nah.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.710
But I got no other choice.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.714
Heard you had a mouth on you.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.193
Must get you in trouble

28:37.237 --> 28:39.935
with that hothead
cop friend of yours.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.763
Hey, what's
that fool's name again?

28:41.807 --> 28:43.286
Daniel Harrelson.

28:43.330 --> 28:47.073
Right... Harrelson.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.857
Didn't he play daddy to your kid

28:48.901 --> 28:50.598
when you was locked up?

28:52.121 --> 28:54.384
Yeah, he looked after my son
for a minute...

28:54.428 --> 28:58.127
while he was turning his back
on me at my parole hearing.

28:58.171 --> 29:02.044
The one shot I had
at being reunited with my son

29:02.088 --> 29:04.351
and he robbed me of that.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.180
Daniel Harrelson thinks
he's the Messiah.

29:07.223 --> 29:08.877
But he's really just a sellout

29:08.921 --> 29:12.489
who'd rather bleed blue
than have our backs, so nah.

29:12.533 --> 29:15.188
He's no friend of mine.

29:15.231 --> 29:18.191
Hmm.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.323
Okay.

29:20.367 --> 29:23.326
Yeah, you passed the first part
of the pop quiz.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.374
Here's the second part.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.594
You want back in?

29:31.682 --> 29:33.946
Try the product.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.774
You got to be joking, right?

29:35.817 --> 29:37.079
Just a little bump.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.342
Wouldn't want you dying on us
or anything.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.311
LAPD!

29:52.834 --> 29:54.053
Drop the weapon!
Drop it!

30:28.652 --> 30:29.740
Rios!

30:29.784 --> 30:32.352
He had you cold, Hondo.

30:34.093 --> 30:36.312
We needed him.

30:36.356 --> 30:38.227
Had no choice, man.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.243
Supposedly
you're an expert,

30:54.287 --> 30:57.203
and yet you appraised
three phony statues

30:57.246 --> 30:59.205
at $30 million apiece.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.728
Either you're lying,

31:00.771 --> 31:03.035
or you're terrible at your job.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.124
I don't know anything
about any phony statues.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.082
The ones that I assessed
were bona fide.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.302
How much did it cost?The statues?

31:09.345 --> 31:10.912
To buy your silence.

31:10.956 --> 31:13.219
That broker,
Gibbs, is dead.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.917
What? Oh, my...

31:15.961 --> 31:17.832
Cops found
your business associate tortured

31:17.876 --> 31:19.529
and unresponsive.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.227
He died on the way to
the hospital a half hour ago.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.011
So, if Gibbs was tortured,
it's likely he came clean,

31:23.055 --> 31:24.926
told the killers that
the statues weren't genuine.

31:24.970 --> 31:28.712
And I'm guessing that your name
came up in the conversation.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.540
Okay, now's the time to speak.
Your life depends on it.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.938
Weaver...

31:36.982 --> 31:38.331
he was hard up.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.898
He had creditors breathing
down his neck,

31:39.941 --> 31:42.465
looming foreclosure.

31:42.509 --> 31:46.252
So he hired me and Gibbs...

31:46.295 --> 31:48.994
to appraise and sell the fakes,
and then...

31:49.037 --> 31:50.430
and then we'd all profit, and...

31:50.473 --> 31:51.910
He'd get to keep the originals.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.874
Where are the statues, Jane?

32:09.101 --> 32:10.232
There you are, Sammie.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.294
Hondo, you're not gonna
believe this.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.730
Tan, get out of the house now.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.079
I just found the statues.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.124
Maxim knows
the statues are there.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.125
We're still ten minutes away.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.822
You need to get out now.

32:56.104 --> 32:58.672
LAPD. Get on the ground.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.848
Nice and slow. Drop the gun.

33:43.282 --> 33:44.892
Chris, Street.
Cover the one side.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.853
LAPD!

34:01.865 --> 34:03.171
Drop the weapon!

34:06.261 --> 34:08.133
Maxim's on the move.

34:08.176 --> 34:09.656
LAPD! Stop!

34:09.699 --> 34:11.223
I'll take one side.
Cover the three.Roger.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.449
20-David, suspect down.

34:29.763 --> 34:32.070
Street, give me status.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.508
Don't move!He shot me.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.379
Don't move.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.294
Give me your hands
behind your back.

34:39.338 --> 34:40.600
I want a doctor.Come on.

34:40.643 --> 34:41.862
Give it to me.

34:45.431 --> 34:47.215
Street!

34:47.259 --> 34:50.305
Street? Street!

35:05.146 --> 35:07.670
Son of a bitch took
a couple potshots at me.

35:07.714 --> 35:09.368
Got me in the vest.You might've hit something
on the way down,

35:09.411 --> 35:10.673
but you're okay.

35:10.717 --> 35:12.849
You're okay.

35:14.851 --> 35:16.505
She's right in here,
Mrs. Weaver.

35:17.550 --> 35:20.205
Nana!
Caitlin.

35:22.729 --> 35:24.383
Everything's
gonna be okay.

35:24.426 --> 35:25.993
I'm here.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.821
Let's get you home,
sweetheart.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.692
Say goodbye
to your friends.

35:29.736 --> 35:33.261
Are you taking Lobo
back to his family now?

35:33.305 --> 35:35.263
You want to know
something cool about Lobo?

35:35.307 --> 35:38.266
We rescued him
when he was just a puppy.

35:38.310 --> 35:40.312
Found him all alone and scared.

35:40.355 --> 35:42.749
He was what they call
a "lone wolf."

35:42.792 --> 35:44.925
But you don't call him
Lone Lobo.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.754
Because he's not alone
anymore.

35:47.797 --> 35:51.236
Not only is he one of
the best police dogs,

35:51.279 --> 35:53.455
but he found a family
in all of us.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.891
And now you, too.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.068
Thank you for finding Sammie.

35:58.112 --> 35:59.722
You're welcome.

35:59.766 --> 36:01.289
Bye, Lobo.

36:08.775 --> 36:09.906
Doing all right?

36:10.951 --> 36:12.344
How does one even begin to heal,

36:12.387 --> 36:14.041
let alone a child?

36:14.084 --> 36:15.695
Long road ahead.

36:15.738 --> 36:18.045
Yeah, it is, but...

36:18.088 --> 36:19.568
there are good people left
in this world

36:19.612 --> 36:22.005
who will help her along the way.

36:22.049 --> 36:23.616
She's already met one.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.621
Maybe we moved too soon.

36:28.664 --> 36:29.926
You trusted your instincts.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.319
Look, this drug, A.N.I.,

36:31.363 --> 36:32.886
it's a gamble.

36:32.929 --> 36:34.670
Who knows how
Leroy would've reacted to it.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.237
Couldn't risk it.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.152
If only Damone hadn't tried
to take that shot.

36:38.196 --> 36:40.023
We could've worked
the immunity angle, something.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.155
Now we're back to square one.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.070
Well, that's not how I see it.

36:43.113 --> 36:45.377
We're chipping away at Saint,
little by little.

36:45.420 --> 36:47.205
Sooner or later,
we're gonna nail him.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.078
Look, do yourself a favor,

36:51.121 --> 36:53.646
go home, get some rest.

37:03.873 --> 37:06.528
That was the hospital.
Becca woke up.

37:06.572 --> 37:08.138
That's great news.Yeah.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.662
How's her recovery looking?

37:09.705 --> 37:12.752
Hard, but, uh, I think
she's gonna pull through.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.755
Look, you should've let me
handle it back there.

37:15.798 --> 37:16.973
All right?
I would've been fine.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.845
No, you don't know that, Leroy.

37:18.888 --> 37:21.282
And I wasn't about to risk
my friend's life on a hunch.

37:22.675 --> 37:24.807
What you said to Damone...

37:24.851 --> 37:26.722
Yeah, I had
to earn dude's trust,

37:26.766 --> 37:28.289
so I said what I had to.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.291
You really think I'm a sellout

37:30.335 --> 37:31.684
who doesn't have
my community's back?

37:31.727 --> 37:32.946
I did,

37:32.989 --> 37:35.209
after you didn't vouch for me,

37:35.253 --> 37:37.646
especially since I knew
that your word

37:37.690 --> 37:40.170
to the parole board
would've made a difference.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.000
Wish you would've trusted me.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.002
I do now.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.281
Well, aren't you the pillar
of the community?

38:03.324 --> 38:05.326
"We make a living
by what we get,

38:05.370 --> 38:08.068
but we make a life
by what we give."

38:08.111 --> 38:09.765
You know who said that?

38:09.809 --> 38:11.724
Forgot my book of quotes
that criminal bastards live by.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.769
You are your father's son.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.381
I'm just gonna get right to it.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.991
Between your raided stash houses
and your main boy,

38:18.034 --> 38:20.036
Damone, dead,
you're on a sinking ship.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.473
I'm poking holes
in your operation,

38:21.516 --> 38:23.344
and it will go under.

38:23.388 --> 38:26.695
It just occurred to me that
I haven't said thank you.

38:26.739 --> 38:29.176
I had a-- how do you say--

38:29.219 --> 38:31.787
a fly in the ointment?

38:31.831 --> 38:34.181
That fly was a common thief.

38:34.224 --> 38:38.011
Stealing from me, but you
and your stubborn scruples...

38:38.054 --> 38:40.405
You swatted that fly.

38:40.448 --> 38:42.145
So, thank you.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.801
You're good.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.847
I'll give you that.

38:47.890 --> 38:51.329
But few things sadder
than a desperate old man.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.592
I'll see you soon.

38:54.723 --> 38:55.898
Churchill.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.250
The quote.

39:00.294 --> 39:03.602
Don't be afraid
to expand your mind, Hondo.

39:03.645 --> 39:07.214
Might collect some unexpected
friends along the way.

39:26.799 --> 39:27.887
Hey.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.410
Cancel your date.

39:29.454 --> 39:31.369
What? Why?

39:32.370 --> 39:33.545
You were right.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.373
I've been playing
with your emotions,

39:35.416 --> 39:36.896
but not because I think
you're stupid, you're not.

39:36.939 --> 39:38.245
You're actually really smart,
you're one of

39:38.288 --> 39:39.725
the smartest people
I've ever met.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.857
Chris, slow down,
you're not making any sense.

39:41.901 --> 39:42.989
Why are you here?

39:43.032 --> 39:45.513
Uh, I...

39:45.557 --> 39:47.602
I thought you died on me today.

39:47.646 --> 39:51.084
And-and-and that thought
only lasted a few seconds,

39:51.127 --> 39:53.347
but I've been the stupid one.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.741
I've been terrified
of losing myself

39:55.784 --> 40:00.485
to the person
I'm terrified of losing.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.312
And I hurt you.

40:03.662 --> 40:06.534
And I wish I could take it back,
but I can't.

40:08.144 --> 40:09.885
I'm so sorry.

40:09.929 --> 40:13.323
And I know me saying it
like this, it's messy.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.195
But if...

40:15.238 --> 40:18.503
but if we can please
try this again,

40:18.546 --> 40:20.766
I'd really like that,

40:20.809 --> 40:22.724
because, um...

40:24.552 --> 40:27.163
Because I love you.

40:29.252 --> 40:32.430
I cancelled my date an hour ago.

41:02.242 --> 41:03.417
I love you.
