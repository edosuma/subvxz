00:04.830 --> 00:07.740
* *
(indistinct conversations)

00:12.140 --> 00:13.460
What's the problem, Don?

00:13.660 --> 00:15.330
We were supposed to get
welcome mai tais.

00:15.530 --> 00:17.330
Brochure said "upon arrival."

00:17.530 --> 00:19.130
I'm sure someone
can get you one.

00:19.330 --> 00:20.300
You see the line at the bar?

00:20.500 --> 00:22.740
Hey, relax. We made it.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.270
We're just gonna kick back
and finally unwind.

00:25.470 --> 00:28.910
Everyone, move back
immediately!

00:29.110 --> 00:31.740
Clear the place out!
Move folks, move. Out the way.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.000
HPD coming through.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.610
HPD!
Hands where I can see 'em.

00:43.410 --> 00:44.670
Easy, now.

00:48.080 --> 00:50.310
* *

01:00.590 --> 01:02.210
We got reports of gunshots.
Who alerted you to them?

01:02.410 --> 01:04.610
No one did.
Okay. Then how
did you get in here,

01:04.810 --> 01:06.350
Special Agent Tennant?

01:06.550 --> 01:08.610
I was invited...
by the victim.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.550
Arrived moments
after he was shot.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.190
Is he connected to an NCIS case?

01:12.390 --> 01:13.550
Not that I know of.

01:13.750 --> 01:15.450
It's likely
the suspect's still nearby.

01:15.650 --> 01:19.260
Captain Akana. Special Agents
Holman, Tara, NCIS.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.190
We're taking her with us.

01:21.390 --> 01:23.300
I just have
a few more questions.
Look, Captain,

01:23.500 --> 01:25.260
I understand
you are just doing your job,

01:25.460 --> 01:27.800
but you checked my weapon
and it hasn't been discharged.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.040
So...
I'm not suggesting
you killed him.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.120
What are you suggesting?

01:33.790 --> 01:35.440
Just keep us
informed, okay?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.940
Absolutely.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.910
Thanks, guys.
Sure.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.580
Who is he?

01:41.780 --> 01:43.820
Oliver Price. Called this
morning, said he had intel

01:44.020 --> 01:45.080
for my eyes only.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.450
So I came.

01:46.650 --> 01:47.920
Without alerting the team?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.810
Didn't know what
I'd be walking into.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.360
All right.

01:55.560 --> 01:56.830
Two in the chest,
one in the head.

01:57.030 --> 01:59.570
No shell casings.
Mozambique drill.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.820
Yeah, this was
a professional hit.

02:05.420 --> 02:06.610
You never met Price before?

02:06.810 --> 02:08.690
I have no idea
who he is.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.340
He knows you.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.000
Or at least a version of you.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.450
JESSE: <i>Who the hell</i>
<i>is Jane Padilla?</i>
KAI: <i>It's an old alias.</i>

02:17.650 --> 02:19.550
It's probably
from Tennant's CIA days.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.220
JESSE: Probably? She didn't say?

02:21.420 --> 02:22.560
No, she wasn't in a chatty mood.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.660
KAI: Yeah, like she was
hiding something.

02:23.860 --> 02:25.190
We knew she didn't kill

02:25.390 --> 02:26.530
this Oliver Price guy.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.430
She's clearly in danger.
KAI: This has bad

02:28.630 --> 02:30.500
CIA vibes all over it.

02:30.700 --> 02:33.450
(clears throat)
Eyes and ears forward, please.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.870
Instead of prognosticating
on our boss' secrets,

02:37.070 --> 02:40.640
let's focus on the dead man
in the hotel room. Oliver Price.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.940
Disgraced MI6 operative.

02:44.140 --> 02:45.280
Now he's freelance.

02:45.480 --> 02:47.410
Known for taking any job,
no matter how shady.

02:47.610 --> 02:48.950
Price was equally unpopular

02:49.150 --> 02:50.820
with employers
and targets alike.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.620
KAI: Any of these employers
or targets

02:52.820 --> 02:54.990
at the Bayside Inn today?
It's hard to say.

02:55.190 --> 02:59.140
I did get our suspect on CCTV,
but it won't do much good.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.500
Why can't we see him clearly?

03:02.700 --> 03:04.930
(scoffs) Infrared LEDs.

03:05.130 --> 03:08.200
They overwhelm the photo diodes
of the cameras.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.870
Yeah, in other words, our killer
knows what he's doing.

03:11.070 --> 03:13.560
What's Tennant
got to do with it?
(phone dings)

03:14.320 --> 03:16.440
Hey. Tennant.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.830
She needs me in the lair.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.120
You're just showing up

03:26.320 --> 03:28.090
in all sorts of places today.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.120
HPD find any clues
what Price wanted from me?

03:30.320 --> 03:32.360
You already know they haven't,
and neither have Kai or Lucy.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.730
What about you?
Not much.

03:34.930 --> 03:37.300
The killer cleaned the room out
of everything of interest.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.680
Not everything.

03:44.650 --> 03:46.240
Where did you get this?

03:46.440 --> 03:47.710
Price's room.

03:47.910 --> 03:49.380
There a reason
you didn't share with the team?

03:49.580 --> 03:52.680
I will. When I know more.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.530
Can you figure out
what the numbers mean?

03:58.270 --> 04:01.500
I feel like I have to note
that you're acting cagey.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.720
How long have
we known each other?

04:04.920 --> 04:07.090
Long enough to notice subtle
changes in your behavior,

04:07.290 --> 04:09.360
let alone seismic ones.
What gives?

04:09.560 --> 04:11.500
I don't know Oliver Price.

04:11.700 --> 04:15.270
The passport is an old alias.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.650
But I don't how he got it.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.990
And the rest is classified.

04:22.090 --> 04:24.580
I've got the
highest clearance.

04:24.780 --> 04:26.580
This lair is a safe space.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.610
My jellyfish do not gossip.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.950
They're-they're not real.

04:30.150 --> 04:31.580
Just look up the numbers.
Okay.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.800
Numbers. Numbers.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.320
Got it.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.330
It's routing numbers
for a Venezuelan bank account.

04:40.530 --> 04:45.210
Any more details? Inflows,
outflows, who has access?

04:46.720 --> 04:48.530
(sighs) Got to go through
FinCEN for those details.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.070
You want me to?

04:50.270 --> 04:51.400
That's procedure.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.740
Yeah, but do you want me to?

04:52.940 --> 04:54.240
Follow procedure? Yes.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.380
All righty. I'm submitting
a request with FinCEN.

04:57.580 --> 04:59.800
It'll take a beat.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.220
Hey, out of curiosity,

05:03.420 --> 05:05.850
this bank account
ring any bells for you?

05:06.050 --> 05:08.640
I don't want to say anything
to compromise your position.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.170
That's a yes.

05:13.340 --> 05:14.940
(door closes)

05:16.450 --> 05:18.930
Hey, Mom.

05:19.130 --> 05:21.570
What's most of
the periodic table made out of?

05:21.770 --> 05:23.520
Squares.

05:24.290 --> 05:25.670
What? If I answer,
how will you learn?

05:25.870 --> 05:29.580
Well, why don't we try
and find out?

05:29.780 --> 05:31.080
Look it up in the book, baby.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.810
Hey, can I have
some friends over?
That's up

05:33.010 --> 05:34.450
to your dad. You guys got
to go to his place tonight.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.150
What? Why?

05:36.350 --> 05:38.280
Something came up at work
and let's just skip the part

05:38.480 --> 05:39.690
where we have an argument, okay?

05:39.890 --> 05:42.290
Pick up Thai on the way.

05:42.490 --> 05:44.310
The good place?
Of course.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.380
Go get your stuff.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.720
(doors close)

06:19.740 --> 06:21.980
(line ringing)

06:59.520 --> 07:01.000
(sighs)

07:01.200 --> 07:05.670
First proper meal
I've had in five days.

07:05.870 --> 07:08.090
Then you could
probably use this, too.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.830
It's just good
to be out of Syria.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.900
Is it as screwed as I think?

07:22.810 --> 07:25.010
Did you at least get Hamdi?

07:25.810 --> 07:27.480
No.

07:30.810 --> 07:33.050
And the extraction team?

07:39.190 --> 07:41.070
The compound was supposed
to be empty.

07:41.270 --> 07:43.410
Hamdi and...
and maybe one of his men.

07:43.610 --> 07:44.780
Look, it was a trap,

07:44.980 --> 07:46.850
but at least you're safe.
Am I?

07:47.050 --> 07:49.780
Hamdi knows it was me.

07:49.980 --> 07:51.980
I'm compromised.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.720
He'll send everyone.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.850
Adrian, look,

07:56.050 --> 07:58.340
you're family, okay?

08:00.140 --> 08:02.030
I am here to help
with next steps.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.010
Passage out of Cyprus.

08:09.050 --> 08:12.070
It's enough money to keep
you comfortable and safe.

08:12.270 --> 08:14.590
I don't know
what to say, Janey.

08:15.390 --> 08:18.240
It's good to know you still
have my back after everything.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.410
That's what we do.

08:20.610 --> 08:23.000
For family.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.000
We?

08:32.840 --> 08:34.980
Janey.

08:38.750 --> 08:41.020
I hoped it would be you.

08:51.060 --> 08:52.710
It's really nice to see you.

08:52.910 --> 08:54.710
How have you been?
You look good.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.410
I'm here to talk
about Cyprus.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.820
I look like someone
who's been in a cage for a year,

08:59.020 --> 09:00.490
because, you know, I have.

09:00.690 --> 09:01.890
Cyprus, Maggie.

09:02.090 --> 09:05.120
I'm not gonna lie.
It has been hard, lonely.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.640
So tedious.

09:11.110 --> 09:14.050
But rightfully so.
I'm paying for my sins.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.270
I'm not doing this.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.540
Yeah, but you're here, Janey.

09:21.740 --> 09:25.210
So either some small part of you
misses me,

09:25.410 --> 09:26.810
or some

09:27.010 --> 09:29.050
bigger part of you
needs something.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.830
Either way,
I'm gonna need something, too.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.370
How are they?

09:37.170 --> 09:40.860
Julie is the star forward
of her soccer team.

09:41.060 --> 09:42.830
Oh, wow.

09:43.030 --> 09:45.100
And Alex is going
to the Naval Academy.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.800
Alex.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.670
That kid.

09:48.870 --> 09:50.440
God.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.960
He is full of surprises.

09:55.190 --> 09:58.140
KAI:
<i>I went through the list</i>
<i>of associates who might</i>

09:58.340 --> 09:59.540
want to harm Price.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.010
None of them are even
remotely near Oahu.

10:01.210 --> 10:02.950
Yeah, I've gone
through all HPD's interviews

10:03.150 --> 10:04.550
with hotel guests and staff.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.520
No witnesses, no evidence.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.020
Our suspect's a ghost.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.960
If it wasn't so annoying...
It'd be impressive.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.360
Anyway, why don't
you break it to Tennant,

10:12.560 --> 10:13.560
you know,
since you're her favorite.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.230
I think it would
have more gravitas

10:15.430 --> 10:18.000
coming from you, you know,
her-her senior agent, so...

10:18.200 --> 10:19.330
(laughs)

10:19.530 --> 10:21.100
Rock, paper, scissor.

10:21.300 --> 10:23.420
All right.

10:24.220 --> 10:25.400
Aah!

10:25.600 --> 10:27.660
Two out of three?
No, no. Y...

10:32.060 --> 10:33.310
Excuse me.

10:33.510 --> 10:35.310
Who are you?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.950
Sorry.
Uh, I get engrossed in my work.

10:38.150 --> 10:41.350
Supervisory Agent
John Swift, OSP.

10:41.550 --> 10:44.090
OSP. That's, uh,
Office of Special Projects?

10:44.290 --> 10:45.890
We handle gray area cases.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.630
For instance,
Jane Tennant's involvement

10:48.830 --> 10:50.300
in yesterday's murder.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.830
Nothing special about that.

10:52.030 --> 10:53.330
The Hawai'i NCIS SAC

10:53.530 --> 10:55.500
was found standing over the body

10:55.700 --> 10:59.100
of a former MI6 agent,
who had a copy

10:59.300 --> 11:01.720
of a fake passport
with her photo on it.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.780
Probably warrants an inquiry.
Plus, she's missing.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.780
Uh, she's not missing. She...
Really?

11:07.980 --> 11:09.310
She booked a flight
to Colorado last night

11:09.510 --> 11:10.620
and has been unreachable.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.050
But I'm open
to your interpretation

11:12.250 --> 11:13.320
of what that means.

11:13.520 --> 11:14.520
Either of you know
that Tennant checked in

11:14.720 --> 11:16.770
into ADX Florence
to meet with...

11:17.610 --> 11:20.160
...you know who?
Hi. You are?

11:20.360 --> 11:23.700
Supervisory Agent John Swift,
Office of Special Projects.

11:23.900 --> 11:26.800
I'm partnering in the...
your investigation.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.700
Investigation of Tennant?
Partnering?

11:29.900 --> 11:31.340
I like to think of us
as partners.

11:31.540 --> 11:32.670
I'm senior partner.

11:32.870 --> 11:34.810
Now, why don't you

11:35.010 --> 11:37.440
fill me in

11:37.640 --> 11:39.960
on, uh... you know who.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.550
This has been a true pleasure.

11:46.750 --> 11:49.820
Does my heart good to know
our family is doing well.

11:50.020 --> 11:53.580
We are no longer family, Maggie.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.230
I am only here because

11:57.430 --> 11:59.920
I do not have a choice.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.990
Cyprus?

12:07.690 --> 12:09.940
The house account that we set up

12:10.140 --> 12:11.940
for our old friend

12:12.140 --> 12:13.510
is empty,

12:13.710 --> 12:16.080
so, someone knows.
Well, it wasn't me.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.080
As you know, I've been
sort of tied up for a while.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.220
Then who?

12:20.420 --> 12:21.950
I couldn't say.

12:22.150 --> 12:25.220
Does the name Oliver Price
mean anything to you?

12:25.420 --> 12:27.030
Not a thing. Only...

12:27.230 --> 12:31.050
you, me and Creel had access
to the account.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.850
Well... that's it?

12:37.820 --> 12:39.270
This shouldn't be
coming up now.

12:39.470 --> 12:41.110
Only three people
know about this.

12:41.310 --> 12:43.710
One is dead,
you're here,

12:43.910 --> 12:47.100
and I would never
dredge this up.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.000
I'm sorry, Janey.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.970
For everything.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.390
Maggie.

12:59.590 --> 13:00.760
Thought you were back home.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.300
You don't seem happy to see me.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.210
Course I am.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.780
Kidding, Adrian.

13:10.420 --> 13:12.070
Our friends at the Puzzle Palace

13:12.270 --> 13:15.440
would like to know
why this op fell one step shy

13:15.640 --> 13:16.980
of the Bay of Pigs.

13:17.180 --> 13:20.010
And you know what,
frankly, so would I.

13:20.210 --> 13:23.550
He's claiming
that he was played.

13:23.750 --> 13:25.070
Not claiming.

13:26.030 --> 13:29.220
So, we're not past denials then?

13:29.420 --> 13:31.760
Information was bad, my intel.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.930
MAGGIE:
Seven men are dead.

13:34.130 --> 13:35.830
Hamdi knew our team was coming.

13:36.030 --> 13:37.830
Knew every move
they would make.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.770
Had militia waiting.
That's more than bad intel.

13:40.970 --> 13:44.290
Wait. You don't think
I did something.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.210
(scoffs)
That's madness.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.540
Jane, would you just...

13:49.740 --> 13:52.360
We know it was
you, Creel.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.020
Not the best time
to go radio silent.

13:57.220 --> 13:58.550
Guess you know about my trip.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.090
To see Maggie Shaw?

14:00.290 --> 14:01.950
Yeah, 'cause it's connected
to Oliver Price's murder?

14:02.150 --> 14:04.990
You have three agents at
your disposal. What can we do?

14:05.190 --> 14:06.460
Nothing.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.910
JESSE:
What do you mean, nothing?

14:09.810 --> 14:12.030
TENNANT:
Hey, there.

14:12.230 --> 14:13.930
Jane Tennant.

14:14.130 --> 14:16.170
I've heard so much about you.

14:16.370 --> 14:18.320
John Swift, OSP. Please.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.790
(sighs)

14:27.400 --> 14:28.580
How can I help you?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.180
It's more what I can do for you.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.120
Spent yesterday morning
with a dead British operative,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.790
spent this morning with
the most notorious double agent

14:34.990 --> 14:37.170
in recent CIA history.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.880
Not really your usual style.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.130
Well, you don't know me.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.760
Jane Tennant.
Three Medals of Merit,

14:46.970 --> 14:48.630
first female SAC at Pearl.

14:48.830 --> 14:52.270
And a very impressive, if
redacted, intelligence career.

14:52.470 --> 14:53.740
I know you, too, John Swift.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.210
By reputation.

14:55.410 --> 14:56.570
Ex-CIA.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.910
Ex-FBI counterintel.

14:59.110 --> 15:02.580
Then joined NCIS to--
I don't know--

15:02.780 --> 15:05.100
annoy me?

15:06.400 --> 15:09.270
Let's start with Maggie Shaw,
shall we?

15:11.970 --> 15:14.760
Conversation was personal,
lots of family talk.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.300
And then, vague.
Something about Cyprus.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.230
And a house account.

15:20.430 --> 15:22.070
Care to explain?

15:22.270 --> 15:23.870
I would not.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.100
Yeah, I knew you'd say that.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.640
Then you know
what I'm gonna say next.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.040
That you have no
intention of sharing

15:29.240 --> 15:30.680
any information
with me.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.340
And you know what I'm gonna say.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.780
That I'm removed
from the Oliver Price case

15:33.980 --> 15:35.250
and my duties as SAC

15:35.450 --> 15:37.420
until the matter is...

15:37.620 --> 15:39.720
resolved.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.790
I'll do you one better.

15:41.990 --> 15:43.560
I'm taking vacation.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.960
I'll be out of your hair.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.460
Just don't go too far.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.110
Yeah.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.870
LUCY: That go okay?
Peachy.

15:54.070 --> 15:55.200
Yeah?
'Cause that was pretty short,

15:55.400 --> 15:56.870
and Swift is still
in your office.

15:57.070 --> 16:00.270
It's his now.
For the time being.

16:00.470 --> 16:02.740
I'm off the case.
I'm taking some vacation.

16:02.940 --> 16:04.310
What the hell did he do?

16:04.510 --> 16:05.740
His job.

16:05.940 --> 16:07.480
And so should you.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.660
Okay?

16:10.430 --> 16:13.170
That doesn't look like a woman
who's going on vacation.

16:13.970 --> 16:15.920
ALEX:
<i>We're just going</i>

16:16.120 --> 16:18.360
on a trip with Dad
in the middle of the week?

16:18.560 --> 16:20.660
Spontaneous, right? Fun.

16:20.860 --> 16:23.460
Spontaneous is not what we do.

16:23.660 --> 16:26.230
We're going to the Big Island
to see a volcano,

16:26.430 --> 16:28.470
and I don't have
to take my chem test.

16:28.670 --> 16:31.370
I say roll with it.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.140
(laughs)

16:34.340 --> 16:35.390
How bad is it?

16:36.590 --> 16:37.980
Look, everything's okay.

16:38.180 --> 16:40.280
All right, just go to your
dad's, keep an eye on Julie.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.180
And we'll be back
together soon.

16:43.380 --> 16:44.980
Okay?

16:45.180 --> 16:47.770
I hear the words,
but I see your expression.

16:48.570 --> 16:51.340
Alex, I'm really gonna
need your help on this one.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.810
Julie, come on. Time to go.

16:59.780 --> 17:01.820
(whispers):
Be careful.

17:02.780 --> 17:03.940
(door closes)
Kate.

17:04.140 --> 17:05.340
Sorry to keep you waiting.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.270
It's okay.
You got a lot going on.

17:08.470 --> 17:10.180
Lucy says you
were suspended.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.030
Did you look into the bank?

17:12.830 --> 17:15.150
A friend who works out of
the FBI field office in Brazil

17:15.350 --> 17:17.350
says money was withdrawn
from the Caracas account

17:17.550 --> 17:18.750
in person at the bank.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.520
No digital record available.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.220
What'll it take to find out?

17:22.420 --> 17:24.220
Well, we send
a disclosure request

17:24.420 --> 17:26.560
and have an agent
follow up in person.

17:26.760 --> 17:28.060
Only if that agent is you.

17:28.260 --> 17:29.980
(laughs)

17:31.650 --> 17:32.800
Oh, you're serious?

17:33.000 --> 17:33.970
This is a sensitive matter.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.330
You're former DIA.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.740
I mean...

17:37.940 --> 17:39.740
I guess I could go.

17:39.940 --> 17:42.240
And I'll come, too.
Uh, I'm not sure

17:42.440 --> 17:44.210
how I'd clear that
with the bosses.

17:44.410 --> 17:46.490
You don't.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.950
(sighs)
Look, Kate, if
you're uncomfortable with it...

17:51.150 --> 17:53.340
I'm deeply uncomfortable
with it.

17:54.770 --> 17:57.310
But I assume you're going
to Caracas no matter what.

18:00.010 --> 18:01.290
So I'll come, too.

18:01.490 --> 18:04.330
Provided you don't keep me
in the dark.

18:04.530 --> 18:05.930
I'll tell you as much as I can
when we're there.

18:06.130 --> 18:07.200
Okay.
Okay.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.730
Let's figure out how
we're getting there.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.250
Already handled.
We leave tonight.

18:12.950 --> 18:15.460
* *

18:27.840 --> 18:30.170
(sighs)
Thanks.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.010
(man speaking Spanish)

18:42.220 --> 18:44.600
English, yes?
Please.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.490
What brings you
so far from home today?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.910
My account
was emptied yesterday.

18:51.110 --> 18:52.410
I'd like to know by whom.

18:52.610 --> 18:54.580
I have copies
of official disclosure requests

18:54.780 --> 18:55.910
from the U.S. State Department.

18:56.110 --> 18:57.420
I'm sure that's
unnecessary.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.780
I can tell you
who emptied the account.

18:59.980 --> 19:01.390
It was you, Ms. Padilla.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.360
On Friday.

19:03.560 --> 19:06.020
You presented us
with your passport

19:06.220 --> 19:08.930
and left with $212,000 in cash.

19:09.130 --> 19:10.710
Everything in order.

19:11.510 --> 19:14.500
Um, you have a photocopy
of that passport?

19:14.700 --> 19:16.320
Of course.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.960
As you can see,
everything in order.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.690
* *

19:34.890 --> 19:37.190
Please tell me
this isn't our hotel.
Not quite yet.

19:37.390 --> 19:38.490
That's a relief.

19:38.690 --> 19:40.360
Listen, I'm, uh,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.360
pretty sure
those guys are following us.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.430
Cheap suits?
Sensible shoes?

19:44.630 --> 19:46.060
They're all SEBIN.
Secret police.

19:46.260 --> 19:47.600
Been on us since the airport.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.730
Okay, and we're just...
we're cool with that?

19:49.930 --> 19:52.020
Want them to think we are.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.760
(man speaking Spanish)

20:03.900 --> 20:05.580
Jane.

20:05.780 --> 20:08.020
What a... surprise.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.150
Um...

20:10.360 --> 20:11.920
I'm happy to see you.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.960
And you brought a friend. Hi.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.030
Only one lie
in that statement.

20:16.230 --> 20:18.210
I...

20:20.350 --> 20:22.900
I, um, don't know what you mean.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.740
I'm the last person
you want to see.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.070
No.

20:26.270 --> 20:28.640
There's never a bad time
to see cherished clients.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.340
Tea?
Answers.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.010
Tell me about Jane Padilla.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.810
Okay.

20:34.010 --> 20:35.910
I can tell that
you're in a mood.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.480
But you know what always helps?

20:37.680 --> 20:38.950
Tea.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.050
Yeah. Oh, oh, oh!

20:40.250 --> 20:41.590
Ooh. (stammers)

20:41.790 --> 20:44.710
That's a, um... a strong
grip there, friend.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.330
Jane Padilla.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.930
Don't look to her.
Look to me.

20:50.130 --> 20:51.730
You created a passport
for me 12 years ago.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.100
(grunts)
Jane Padilla.

20:54.300 --> 20:56.800
And then you reissued
it to someone else.
No.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.970
I have never reissued
an identity in my life.

21:00.170 --> 21:03.190
That's lie number two.
You get three.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.510
Oh, okay. Yes, I see now.

21:09.710 --> 21:13.180
Uh, someone must have
forged my forgery.

21:13.390 --> 21:14.850
It happens all the time.

21:15.050 --> 21:16.220
(groaning)

21:16.420 --> 21:18.190
Can I have my arm...
can I have my arm back, please?

21:18.390 --> 21:19.920
That's your work, Marty.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.300
I would never
betray a client, okay?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.660
Let alone one as, uh...

21:25.860 --> 21:27.800
connected as you.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.570
What do you think, Kate?

21:29.770 --> 21:31.500
That's definitely a lie.
Yeah.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.640
(shouts, groans)

21:33.840 --> 21:36.070
Okay, okay, stop, please.

21:36.270 --> 21:39.080
(groans, sighs)

21:39.280 --> 21:41.150
Okay.

21:41.350 --> 21:42.480
That hurt my feelings.

21:42.680 --> 21:44.150
She came to me last week.

21:44.350 --> 21:45.480
She who?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.220
I don't know her name.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.790
Um, she called herself Jane.

21:49.990 --> 21:52.320
But she was with a man--
Oliver Price.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.060
He had the money.
Enough for ten identities.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.530
And you gave them mine?
I didn't give it to them.

21:57.730 --> 21:59.160
They already knew it.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.650
Your alias,
your real name, Mag...

22:03.950 --> 22:05.840
Maggie Shaw and Creel.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.510
They knew everything.

22:07.710 --> 22:09.140
I didn't have a choice.

22:09.340 --> 22:11.190
You still don't.

22:12.190 --> 22:14.800
Where is she now?

22:15.630 --> 22:17.480
Why would Tennant
be in Caracas?

22:17.680 --> 22:19.020
She wouldn't.

22:19.220 --> 22:21.350
No, but she is, along with Kate.

22:21.550 --> 22:23.740
Kate texted me.
What?

22:24.810 --> 22:26.260
They went
to check out that bank.

22:26.460 --> 22:27.960
Mm-hmm.
The account belongs to Tennant

22:28.160 --> 22:30.160
or maybe an alias
of hers, at least.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.730
What else did Whistler say?
Nothing. She just had to go.

22:32.930 --> 22:34.830
I tried to call,
but it went to voicemail.

22:35.030 --> 22:37.500
What is going on?
ERNIE: Skullduggery,

22:37.700 --> 22:39.900
chicanery, deception.

22:40.100 --> 22:44.560
Spycraft, my friends,
as old as civilization itself.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.780
Bank account-- completely empty,
but it used to have millions.

22:48.980 --> 22:50.950
We're through the looking glass.

22:51.150 --> 22:52.650
Black is white.
White is black.

22:52.850 --> 22:54.020
Yes, we get it. CIA stuff.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.290
Tennant had access
to this account.

22:56.490 --> 22:58.260
But the money isn't hers.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.390
This is a slush fund
set up by the government

23:01.590 --> 23:03.360
for covert ops.
JESSE: Okay,

23:03.560 --> 23:04.930
any idea who emptied it?

23:05.130 --> 23:06.860
Not yet, but I was able

23:07.060 --> 23:08.970
to track a wire transfer

23:09.170 --> 23:11.040
that went straight
to our dead man, Oliver Price.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.840
So Price was in Caracas, right?

23:13.040 --> 23:14.740
He gets paid
by Tennant's secret account,

23:14.940 --> 23:17.380
and then somehow he ends up
dead in a hotel

23:17.580 --> 23:18.940
on the island looking for her.

23:19.140 --> 23:20.480
We got to get
to Caracas right now.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.510
Boss needs our help.

23:22.710 --> 23:24.520
No one's going anywhere.

23:24.720 --> 23:27.200
Except you, Agent Boone.
My office.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.590
It's Tennant's office.

23:30.790 --> 23:33.490
You're senior agent here, right?

23:33.690 --> 23:35.260
Yes, but that's got nothing...

23:35.460 --> 23:37.230
You don't act like it.

23:37.430 --> 23:40.770
Grabbing your gear like some
rookie to do what, exactly?

23:40.970 --> 23:42.300
Help Tennant.
How?

23:42.500 --> 23:44.900
By getting yourself arrested
or killed?

23:45.100 --> 23:46.140
Because of your boss?

23:46.340 --> 23:47.440
Yeah, she's more
than just our boss.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.970
I don't doubt she's a friend.

23:49.170 --> 23:51.140
But friends don't let
other friends commit crimes.

23:51.340 --> 23:52.810
Tennant hasn't
committed a crime.

23:53.010 --> 23:55.060
Not acting like she's
innocent of any, either.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.070
I'm not a babysitter.

24:00.370 --> 24:03.660
I'm not the one they send
in when everything's okay.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.040
I'm the other guy.

24:06.670 --> 24:08.360
There's a murder to solve here

24:08.560 --> 24:10.290
that Tennant may
or may not be involved in.

24:10.490 --> 24:13.780
That is what
your team needs to do.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.540
With all due respect,
Agent Swift,

24:17.740 --> 24:19.440
no.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.610
Then you're benched.

24:21.810 --> 24:23.710
I'm sorry, what?

24:23.910 --> 24:25.740
Reassigned.

24:25.940 --> 24:27.750
Indexing cold cases.

24:27.950 --> 24:31.180
Either get along
or go along.

24:31.380 --> 24:34.170
Now.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.020
(baby crying in distance)

24:38.220 --> 24:40.440
Not much to look at, huh?

24:41.210 --> 24:43.230
Generally clean,
generally safe.

24:43.430 --> 24:46.000
I've been in worse.
This feels like
we're not heading back

24:46.200 --> 24:47.360
to Hawai'i any time soon.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.830
Well, you have a flight
in the morning.

24:49.030 --> 24:50.000
I'm gonna go check out
that address

24:50.200 --> 24:51.740
that Marty gave me.
Need to find

24:51.940 --> 24:53.240
the woman
who's been using my alias.

24:53.440 --> 24:55.140
I've got to run an errand.
I'll be back soon with dinner.

24:55.340 --> 24:58.110
No, that wasn't
the agreement.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.910
You said you wanted to get
information from the bank.

25:00.110 --> 25:02.050
I saw the logic.
But you have no authority

25:02.250 --> 25:04.150
to go looking
for a suspect in Venezuela.

25:04.350 --> 25:05.680
It's not that simple, Kate.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.350
It's exactly
that simple.

25:07.550 --> 25:08.890
Maggie Shaw?

25:09.090 --> 25:11.370
Marty mentioned her
and someone named Creel.

25:21.050 --> 25:23.870
Okay. All right.

25:24.070 --> 25:25.440
I'll tell you.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.440
It was Syria, years ago.
Start of the war.

25:28.640 --> 25:32.310
Maggie and I ran an asset.
Adrian Creel.

25:32.510 --> 25:35.110
He did some business.
Never knew what kind,

25:35.310 --> 25:37.620
but he claimed to be a patriot.

25:37.820 --> 25:40.720
Said he wanted to help take out
some very bad people.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.250
Sounds shady.

25:42.450 --> 25:44.060
It was. He was.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.990
That's who you work with
in intelligence.

25:46.190 --> 25:48.860
Adrian's intel was always solid.

25:49.060 --> 25:51.430
He'd proven himself many times.

25:51.630 --> 25:53.030
So, in return, we funded him.

25:53.230 --> 25:56.500
Off the books so it was never
traced back to the U.S.

25:56.700 --> 25:59.150
That's what the account was for.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.740
So, thinking Creel's responsible
for all this now?

26:03.940 --> 26:05.960
That's impossible.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.030
Creel's dead.

26:12.130 --> 26:14.870
Jane, please, put it away.

26:15.670 --> 26:18.790
Tell her. So we can have
a proper conversation.

26:18.990 --> 26:22.310
How about the truth first,
Adrian?

26:23.880 --> 26:26.430
It's a business of chance.

26:26.630 --> 26:28.570
You both know that.

26:28.770 --> 26:30.700
I can't be responsible
for what others do.

26:30.900 --> 26:32.170
This wasn't chance.

26:32.370 --> 26:35.540
You fed us bad intel
and seven men died.

26:35.740 --> 26:36.910
It's not my fault.

26:37.110 --> 26:39.510
Now, we all...

26:39.710 --> 26:40.880
we all take risks.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.680
You cooperating with Hamdi
was an epic risk.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.680
He knew our
every move.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.850
That's not what...
I was used. I...

26:49.050 --> 26:51.170
Okay, okay! Okay.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.460
Yes.

26:54.660 --> 26:56.580
The information was bad.

26:57.580 --> 26:59.210
And I knew it.

27:00.310 --> 27:01.830
I didn't have a choice.

27:02.030 --> 27:03.600
They were going to kill me.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.690
And the money?

27:06.120 --> 27:08.110
What money?

27:08.310 --> 27:10.170
That they paid you.

27:10.370 --> 27:12.040
How much was your
betrayal worth?

27:12.240 --> 27:13.810
No, I-I w-I would never...

27:14.010 --> 27:15.450
Because you can't
have it both ways.

27:15.650 --> 27:18.920
He either bribed you
or he coerced you.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.350
Either way, we don't care.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.320
Go ahead, put him
Wait...

27:23.520 --> 27:25.170
out of his misery.
Don't! Don't!

27:30.810 --> 27:32.930
What's up, guys?

27:33.130 --> 27:34.270
Hey, we're real sorry
you got benched.

27:34.470 --> 27:35.630
Yeah, and Swift
made it clear we can't

27:35.830 --> 27:36.830
talk to you about the case.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.640
But Ernie's got some hot goss.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.100
But we can't tell you.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.640
All right, I'm starting
to think I should just

27:41.840 --> 27:43.270
go back to my filing.
Stay.

27:43.470 --> 27:44.710
At least until tea is ready.

27:44.910 --> 27:46.980
I don't really dig tea.

27:47.180 --> 27:49.710
You'll dig this tea.
Not some prepackaged bag,

27:49.910 --> 27:51.020
but loose leaf.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.950
And, of course,
some of the leaves may leak

27:53.150 --> 27:55.120
into the cup.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.720
The bank account is the tea bag,

27:58.920 --> 28:02.560
and I've torn open the bag
to reveal the leaves,

28:02.760 --> 28:04.730
because the leaves

28:04.930 --> 28:07.410
are diffuse.

28:09.720 --> 28:10.500
Uh...

28:10.700 --> 28:11.940
Yeah, no idea.
Ugh!

28:12.140 --> 28:13.200
You guys are the worst!

28:13.400 --> 28:14.870
I don't know who emptied
the account,

28:15.070 --> 28:17.990
but I was able to track
other debits from years ago.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.910
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars sent

28:21.110 --> 28:22.850
to a dummy NGO in Syria.

28:23.050 --> 28:25.180
Actually cover
for CIA covert ops.

28:25.380 --> 28:28.690
Target was warlord Ahmed Hamdi.

28:28.890 --> 28:31.520
He was supposed to be
taken into custody.

28:31.720 --> 28:33.120
And you're thinking
Tennant was involved?
She was.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.530
And Maggie Shaw.

28:34.730 --> 28:36.260
Which is why Tennant
visited her in prison.

28:36.460 --> 28:38.030
So what happened on this op?

28:38.230 --> 28:41.030
Total disaster.
Hamdi wasn't even there.

28:41.230 --> 28:42.530
But his fighters were.

28:42.730 --> 28:45.240
Eight operatives went in,
one survived.

28:45.440 --> 28:49.790
None other than our favorite
snack-eating mystery man.

28:50.590 --> 28:52.810
Charlie 1.
LUCY: You think Tennant knows

28:53.010 --> 28:53.780
Charlie 1 was involved?

28:53.980 --> 28:55.280
It's impossible to say.

28:55.480 --> 28:56.850
We need to find out more info,

28:57.050 --> 28:59.720
and since Tennant's not talking,
we got to get creative.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.190
I'll check out her
house and I'll see if

29:01.390 --> 29:02.350
she's got anything
hidden there.

29:02.550 --> 29:03.820
You're just gonna break in?
Ow.

29:04.020 --> 29:05.190
He won't break in.
I have a key.

29:05.390 --> 29:06.790
In case of emergency.
This counts.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.260
I'm not sure she's gonna
see it that way.
JESSE: Listen,

29:09.460 --> 29:10.630
boss has herself tied up

29:10.830 --> 29:12.730
into something really big,
and she needs us,

29:12.930 --> 29:15.600
even if she doesn't
know it yet.
Well, I mean...

29:15.800 --> 29:17.580
Hey. (clears throat)

29:22.560 --> 29:23.940
Oh, you're back.

29:24.140 --> 29:26.240
Yeah. Got us something to eat.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.950
Yeah, enough for,
like, six people.

29:29.150 --> 29:30.380
Expecting company?

29:30.580 --> 29:32.680
Well, you never know when
you'll be back in Caracas,

29:32.880 --> 29:34.990
so I wanted to give you
the full culinary experience.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.150
And what's in there?

29:36.350 --> 29:38.570
Oh, just some stuff I need.

29:40.310 --> 29:42.790
Is that a grenade?
Flash bang.

29:42.990 --> 29:45.330
Stun grenades.
Look, I-I've been
keeping my piece here,

29:45.530 --> 29:47.400
but it would be completely
irresponsible for me

29:47.600 --> 29:50.100
to let you move forward
with whatever this is.

29:50.300 --> 29:51.770
Makes complete sense.

29:51.970 --> 29:55.610
You are a rational,
intelligent agent, Kate.

29:55.810 --> 29:56.810
I'd expect nothing less.

29:57.010 --> 29:58.310
And you're right.

29:58.510 --> 30:01.080
I shouldn't be doing this.
No,

30:01.280 --> 30:02.310
you shouldn't.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.520
Okay, so, you know,
maybe we just...

30:04.720 --> 30:06.700
What the hell?!

30:09.070 --> 30:11.570
A long time ago
I made a mistake.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.210
And I need to fix it.
Alone.

30:17.810 --> 30:19.200
There's enough food
for a couple days.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.420
Water, too. I'm sorry.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.690
Tennant.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.320
I know.

30:36.360 --> 30:38.020
(indistinct chatter)

30:38.220 --> 30:40.120
("Barlovento"
by Ignacio Bermudez playing)

30:40.320 --> 30:42.300
Gracias.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.790
* *

31:14.670 --> 31:16.900
(speaking Spanish)

31:25.380 --> 31:27.410
(door opens)

31:35.760 --> 31:38.060
(floorboard creaks)

31:43.830 --> 31:46.100
(grunting)

31:49.800 --> 31:51.290
Easy there, tiger.

31:51.490 --> 31:53.240
Charlie 1.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.890
I'm surprised you're not
more surprised to see me.

31:57.090 --> 31:59.500
In Tennant's house, yes.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.630
On the island, we kinda figured.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.100
And what'd you figure?

32:03.300 --> 32:05.170
That you're involved in
Oliver Price's murder.

32:05.370 --> 32:07.400
The infrared LEDs.
The professional work.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.240
I figure you killed him
and it had something to do

32:10.440 --> 32:12.240
with a raid that
went sideways in Syria.

32:12.440 --> 32:15.160
My whole team getting killed's
a little bit more than sideways.

32:18.030 --> 32:19.150
Was Price involved in the raid?

32:19.350 --> 32:21.790
No.
Then why did
you kill him?

32:21.990 --> 32:23.120
I'm not saying I did.

32:23.320 --> 32:26.190
But if I did,
it was only to protect Tennant.

32:26.390 --> 32:28.690
He was coming to get her.
Why?

32:28.890 --> 32:30.860
If she didn't say,
I'm not gonna.

32:31.060 --> 32:32.660
She said enough.
She told us about Creel.

32:32.860 --> 32:34.330
Nice try.

32:34.530 --> 32:36.770
If she had, you wouldn't
be breaking into her house.

32:36.970 --> 32:38.940
I didn't break into her house.
I had a key.

32:39.140 --> 32:42.270
Anyway, she's in Caracas,
you're not. Tells me everything.

32:42.470 --> 32:43.310
Where you going?

32:43.510 --> 32:44.740
To Caracas.
Tennant needs help.

32:44.940 --> 32:46.140
You know I can't let you go.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.640
You're a suspect
in a homicide

32:47.840 --> 32:49.680
and I'm not convinced
you're the good guy here.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.780
If I wasn't you would be dead.

32:51.980 --> 32:53.280
That doesn't help your cause.

32:53.480 --> 32:55.950
I know this is hard for you.
I made it easier.

32:56.150 --> 32:58.210
I took your weapon.

32:59.810 --> 33:01.160
What are you gonna do?

33:01.360 --> 33:02.880
Turn around
and get on your knees.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.600
Count to ten.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.390
One, two...

33:14.720 --> 33:16.290
Ten.

33:26.570 --> 33:27.830
(phone dings)

33:34.010 --> 33:35.630
Got a minute to chat?

33:35.830 --> 33:38.230
Or are you going someplace?

33:38.430 --> 33:41.430
Because that text
seems important.

33:41.630 --> 33:44.070
No. It's fine.
Good.

33:44.270 --> 33:46.270
Everything happening
with your boss

33:46.470 --> 33:49.640
has me reflecting on my past.

33:49.840 --> 33:51.710
I was in intelligence, too.

33:51.910 --> 33:53.740
Oh, yeah?
That's a coincidence.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.850
Yeah, stationed in Libya
back in the day.

33:56.050 --> 33:58.000
Worked with the rebels.

33:58.970 --> 34:01.250
Asset of ours was
tortured and murdered.

34:01.450 --> 34:03.890
Her body left at her house
for her family to find.

34:04.090 --> 34:05.360
That's brutal.
Yeah.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.020
My chief of station
took it hard.

34:07.220 --> 34:10.690
Well, we all did, but he was
close with this woman,

34:10.890 --> 34:12.230
wanted retribution,

34:12.430 --> 34:14.230
and in his haste, he acted.

34:14.430 --> 34:17.020
Killed a man he thought
was responsible.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.240
But he was wrong.

34:20.440 --> 34:23.620
The man was innocent,
and it ruined him.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.710
Emotion

34:25.910 --> 34:28.280
has no part in our work.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.150
Friendship only
clouds the truth.

34:31.350 --> 34:33.750
If Tennant is innocent...
She is.

34:33.950 --> 34:35.970
let the facts bear it out.

34:40.040 --> 34:42.030
Work with me.

34:42.230 --> 34:44.100
Not against me.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.260
That means no more
secret kitchen meetings

34:45.460 --> 34:47.430
or sneaking into
Tennant's house.

34:47.630 --> 34:50.930
How did you know about...
I just do, Agent Boone.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.740
I also know that
if we work together

34:52.940 --> 34:55.290
we can help Tennant through
whatever mess she's in.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.040
What do you say?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.990
<i>(phone vibrates)</i>

35:03.600 --> 35:05.100
Come on.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.470
Oh. (exhales)

35:13.540 --> 35:15.330
Lucy.
Kate, where have you been?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.690
Uh, Tennant cuffed me to a post,

35:17.890 --> 35:19.500
but it's not important.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.660
Sounds kind of important.

35:20.860 --> 35:21.770
Tennant went off on her own.
She's...

35:21.970 --> 35:23.950
Ow. She's in trouble.

35:43.270 --> 35:44.590
Keep your hands
where they are.

35:44.790 --> 35:46.120
(grunts softly)

35:46.320 --> 35:47.390
How can I help you?

35:47.590 --> 35:50.460
Answers.
Why are you impersonating me?

35:50.660 --> 35:52.200
Who put you up to it
and where are they now?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.700
You don't want to do this.
And why is that?

35:54.900 --> 35:57.220
(both grunting)

36:10.000 --> 36:13.230
(shouting)

36:31.820 --> 36:34.360
(gasping)

36:44.470 --> 36:46.020
Don't.

36:46.220 --> 36:48.070
Just don't.

37:08.190 --> 37:10.840
Drop the gun.
Get in the car.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.060
No.

37:15.160 --> 37:16.250
It's not choice.

37:16.450 --> 37:18.100
Whatever's gonna happen's
gonna happen.

37:19.230 --> 37:21.350
(rapid gunfire)

37:21.550 --> 37:23.300
(grunts)

37:26.740 --> 37:28.240
Hello, stranger.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.560
(gunshot)
Charlie, no!

37:32.760 --> 37:34.580
Damn it.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.670
Got a funny way of saying
thank you for saving your life.

37:37.870 --> 37:39.890
Thank you.

37:40.850 --> 37:44.170
Okay, define "bag of guns."

37:44.380 --> 37:45.380
Uh, a lot of them.

37:45.580 --> 37:46.780
KAI:
You don't know where she went?

37:46.980 --> 37:48.250
She's uh, she's looking
for the woman

37:48.450 --> 37:50.610
who's impersonating her
somewhere in Caracas.

37:50.810 --> 37:52.050
Wait, can't Ernie
track her phone?

37:52.250 --> 37:53.620
LUCY:
Her phone's turned off, Kate.

37:53.820 --> 37:55.250
Have Ernie turn it
back on remotely.

37:55.450 --> 37:57.350
Ernie isn't magic.

37:57.550 --> 37:58.420
The phone's off,
it's off.

37:58.620 --> 37:59.460
But I can locate where it was

37:59.660 --> 38:00.620
before it turned off.

38:00.820 --> 38:03.490
Okay, um, whatever she's doing,

38:03.690 --> 38:05.830
it's-it's best
we don't tell Swift.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.860
Uh...
Uh, it's

38:08.060 --> 38:09.920
a little late for that.

38:11.320 --> 38:12.370
Hello, Agent Whistler.

38:12.570 --> 38:15.040
Agent Swift. Uh,

38:15.240 --> 38:18.440
nice to, um...
Yeah.

38:18.640 --> 38:21.950
We don't really know
what Tennant intends to do.

38:22.150 --> 38:24.480
Bag of guns, phone off.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.950
Yeah, doesn't look good.

38:26.150 --> 38:27.650
We just need to find her.

38:27.850 --> 38:29.250
And Charlie 1
is probably already there.

38:29.450 --> 38:31.490
Charlie 1? Really?
ERNIE: I got something.

38:31.690 --> 38:33.920
Tennant's phone
turned on three times

38:34.120 --> 38:35.430
in the last two hours.

38:35.630 --> 38:37.730
Just for a moment,
then it turns back off again.

38:37.930 --> 38:39.000
GPS coordinates are at

38:39.200 --> 38:40.730
the edge of the city,
but then I lose her.

38:40.930 --> 38:42.000
Give me Tennant's last location.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.430
LUCY:
Kate's not up to it.

38:43.630 --> 38:45.970
She got herself handcuffed
to a kitchen post.

38:46.170 --> 38:47.740
Yeah, and I got myself out.

38:47.940 --> 38:49.610
You are unarmed
and you don't know Spanish

38:49.810 --> 38:50.810
and you don't know
where you're going.

38:51.010 --> 38:53.060
You got a better idea?

38:57.430 --> 38:58.620
(clears throat)

38:58.820 --> 39:00.970
You're gonna do great.

39:03.600 --> 39:04.920
TENNANT:
We don't have time for this.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.460
There is always time
to stave off infection.

39:07.660 --> 39:09.980
(sighs)

39:10.780 --> 39:12.710
Why are you here?

39:14.310 --> 39:15.530
Ahmed Hamdi.

39:15.730 --> 39:17.350
Syria, 12 years ago.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.070
You were there?

39:20.270 --> 39:23.290
I was the only one
who walked away.

39:25.330 --> 39:26.960
I had no idea.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.550
Operation was compartmented.

39:29.750 --> 39:32.270
You didn't know our identities,
we didn't know yours.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.300
But I was sure
you guys screwed it up.

39:37.140 --> 39:40.770
I tried for years
to find out who was involved.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.080
Wanted to know
who sent us to die.

39:46.350 --> 39:48.530
When did you realize
that it was me?

39:48.730 --> 39:50.100
Few days ago.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.970
Got wind Oliver Price was
digging into ancient history.

39:53.170 --> 39:56.070
Started tracking him,
and that's when

39:56.270 --> 39:57.540
your name came up
from the old op.

39:57.740 --> 40:00.130
I didn't know
that it was a trap.
I know.

40:01.090 --> 40:02.930
It was someone named Creel.

40:04.870 --> 40:05.750
He played us all.

40:05.950 --> 40:08.150
Oliver Price had an agenda.

40:08.350 --> 40:10.790
He wasn't just looking for you.
He wanted more.

40:10.990 --> 40:12.220
You talked to him?
Briefly.

40:12.420 --> 40:13.790
In a hotel room
before I took him out.

40:13.990 --> 40:15.830
Okay, see,
I wish you hadn't, because

40:16.030 --> 40:17.160
I would have liked
to question him.

40:17.360 --> 40:19.210
He didn't give me a choice.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.900
Well, any idea what
he wanted from me?

40:23.100 --> 40:24.970
Feels like he wanted
to bring you here.

40:25.170 --> 40:26.800
I think Creel sent him.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.490
That's not possible.

40:31.590 --> 40:33.740
Don't!
Just don't.

40:33.940 --> 40:36.880
I'll do anything.
I'll go back to Hamdi.

40:37.080 --> 40:39.280
I-I can be a
double agent.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.820
Please, Janey.

40:42.020 --> 40:46.590
Please. I'll go away.
I'll disappear.

40:46.790 --> 40:48.790
No one will ever know.

40:48.990 --> 40:50.290
It will be like I'm dead.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.480
Stop talking!

40:59.450 --> 41:00.600
Janey,

41:00.800 --> 41:03.090
this isn't you.
(groans)

41:10.000 --> 41:11.210
Maggie, he's
getting away!

41:11.410 --> 41:13.150
It's okay.
Don't we need him?

41:13.350 --> 41:14.590
It's okay.

41:14.790 --> 41:16.270
Creel is lost now.

41:21.010 --> 41:22.360
(car door closes)

41:22.560 --> 41:24.110
(engine starts)

41:28.550 --> 41:30.200
Maggie.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.800
There was no way
she was letting him get away.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.890
She did what I couldn't.

41:36.360 --> 41:37.710
That's cold-blooded.
I dig it.

41:37.910 --> 41:39.160
Yeah?

41:39.960 --> 41:41.810
Well, you were
the only other person

41:42.010 --> 41:43.110
who knows what we did.

41:43.310 --> 41:44.480
Someone else
wants to dig it all up.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.780
And whoever it is,
they know everything.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.020
About Creel, the secret account.

41:50.220 --> 41:51.660
Now they want me.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.220
Well...

41:54.420 --> 41:57.140
we're not gonna
let 'em have you.

41:58.210 --> 42:00.200
We need to find out
who's behind this.

42:00.400 --> 42:03.620
We will, but only
once you're safe.

42:04.990 --> 42:07.140
I'm so close.

42:07.340 --> 42:08.890
To getting yourself killed?

42:10.490 --> 42:12.140
No, Jane Tennant.

42:12.340 --> 42:15.010
I came all the way here
to keep you safe.

42:15.210 --> 42:16.580
And that's exactly
what I am gonna...

42:16.780 --> 42:18.350
(gunshot)

42:18.550 --> 42:21.400
Ch-Charlie. Charlie.

42:30.010 --> 42:32.450
Hello, Janey.
