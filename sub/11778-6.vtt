09:55.261 --> 09:57.680
DEFINITELY
GIVES IT DIMENSION.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.473
- KYLE, YOU GOT
THE ASIAN WATER MONITOR.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.851
- THE DETAIL IN THE FACE
IS REALLY NICE.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.769
THE DARKNESS OF
THE DEEP-SET EYES,

10:03.853 --> 10:04.812
IT ADDS A LOT OF DEPTH.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.355
- I LOVE THE CONTOUR,

10:06.439 --> 10:07.523
THE LIP THAT YOU CUT
ALL THE WAY BACK TO HIS JAW.

10:07.606 --> 10:09.567
THAT REALLY CAME OUT
KILLER, MAN.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.943
- THANK YOU.
- TATU BABY.

10:11.027 --> 10:13.487
- THE LEOPARD HAS A LOT
OF DETAIL IN THE FACE,

10:13.571 --> 10:16.032
SO I WANTED TO DO
THE FACE PRETTY BIG

10:16.115 --> 10:17.158
AND THEN JUST BLEND
EVERYTHING.

10:17.241 --> 10:19.702
- YOU DID A GREAT JOB
ON THE DETAIL IN THE EYES.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.203
JUST THE HIGHLIGHTS IN THE EYES
REALLY MAKE THIS THING

10:21.287 --> 10:22.872
JUMP OUT FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.874
- THE GREEN IN THE LEAVES
WITH THE GREEN IN THE EYES,

10:24.957 --> 10:27.043
THOSE TWO TONES, THEY REALLY
MAKE IT POP A LITTLE MORE.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.211
IT'S A GREAT JOB.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.381
- JOEY.
- I HAD THE TIGER.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.591
- YOUR BIGGEST STRUGGLE
IN THIS WAS THE PLACEMENT.

10:33.674 --> 10:36.052
THE POSITIONING
OF THE MOUTH AND THE NOSE

10:36.135 --> 10:37.345
THERE ON A TILT,
AND IT MAKES IT A LOT HARDER

10:37.428 --> 10:39.555
TO READ
FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.723
SINCE YOU WENT APPLES
TO APPLES WITH BABY'S,

10:40.806 --> 10:43.726
ONCE YOU WERE OFF,
IT'S HARD TO LINE IT UP

10:43.809 --> 10:44.769
AND MAKE IT SYMMETRICAL

10:44.852 --> 10:45.561
AND BE ABLE
TO HIT ALL THOSE DETAILS.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.897
{\an8}- I MIGHT WIN THIS.
THANK YOU.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.940
- E.S.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.693
I HAD A GUENON MONKEY
FROM CENTRAL AFRICA.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.403
- YOU DID A NICE JOB
IN THE FACE.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.072
YOU DID SOME NICE DETAIL
IN THE CHEST.

10:56.155 --> 10:58.616
- THE TEXTURE IN THE HAIR,
THE COAT,

10:58.699 --> 10:59.700
I THINK IT CAME OUT NICE.

10:59.784 --> 11:00.576
- JIME.

11:00.659 --> 11:02.036
- I CHOSE THE OWL
FOR MYSELF.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.121
- WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS IS
THE FEATHER HORNS THAT COME UP

11:04.205 --> 11:06.499
THAT HAVE A LOT OF DARK,
RICH TONES AND HIGHLIGHTS.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.751
IT GIVES IT A DETAIL THAT REALLY
MAKES THAT PART STAND OUT.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.544
- OVERALL,
IT'S A NICE JOB.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.382
- JOSHUA.
JIME GAVE YOU THE PORCUPINE.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.592
- THIS THING IS HARD FOR ME.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.970
THERE'S NO AREA WHERE YOU
REALLY HAVE FINE DETAILS.

11:20.054 --> 11:23.766
NAILING THE DETAILS IS WHAT
REALLY KILLED YOU HERE.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.935
- THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT THIS
THAT SAYS PORCUPINE.

11:26.018 --> 11:27.812
HE JUST WASTED
A WHOLE BUNCH OF PAINT.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.397
{\an8}IT JUST LOOKS LIKE [bleep].

11:29.480 --> 11:31.607
- JACKIE, AND THIS IS
AN ALBINO BURMESE PYTHON.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.610
- I DON'T REALLY
SEE ANY DETAIL ANYWHERE

11:34.693 --> 11:35.945
ON THE BELLY OR THE SCALES.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.196
- IF YOU WOULD'VE
MAYBE BEEN ABLE

11:37.279 --> 11:39.407
TO KEEP THE SCALE PATTERN
GOING THROUGHOUT,

11:39.490 --> 11:41.158
IT WOULD'VE LOOKED LIKE
IT WAS MORE REALISTIC.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.452
- CRAIG.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.787
- I HAD THE VULTURE.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.038
- THE ONE THING
THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO GET

11:46.122 --> 11:47.957
IS THE FEATHERS AROUND
THE NECK AND THE CHEST.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.543
THAT DOES SHOW
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF DETAIL.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.460
- THE WHITE WITH
THE DIFFERENT TONES

11:51.544 --> 11:53.796
AND THE HEAVY STROKES
ON THERE,

11:53.879 --> 11:55.673
THAT AREA IS JUST
REALLY STRIKING TO ME.

11:55.756 --> 11:56.924
- THANK YOU.

11:57.007 --> 11:57.967
- JASON.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.802
- I REALLY LIKE WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE FACE.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.471
YOU DID GET SOME NICE SUBTLE
TEXTURES IN HER CHIN

12:02.555 --> 12:04.223
TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE THE NOSE.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.809
AS FAR AS TIME, IT FEELS LIKE
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.769
- I SPENT MORE OF MY TIME
TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK FURRY

12:08.853 --> 12:10.980
THAN I DID TRYING
TO COVER MORE SPACE.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.273
{\an8}I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.066
{\an8}NOT A GREAT WAY
TO IMPRESS THE JUDGES.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.862
IT SUCKS.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.156
{\an8}- I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO SEE JOSHUA GO.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.824
{\an8}- THAT'S GONNA BE
ALMOST RIDICULOUS.

12:21.907 --> 12:23.159
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M GONNA DO.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.702
{\an8}- I'M IN TROUBLE.
I'M FREAKING OUT.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.245
- YOU GOTTA
GET YOUR HEAD IN IT,

12:26.328 --> 12:26.912
OR YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO GET OUT.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.714
- TRANSFORMING MODELS
INTO WILD ANIMALS

12:36.797 --> 12:38.340
WITH DETAIL AND FINE LINES.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.009
WE HAD JOSHUA.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.635
WHAT'D YOU THINK
OF THE PORCUPINE DESIGN?

12:41.719 --> 12:44.180
- THERE WAS NO NICE DETAIL
IN THIS THING.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.640
HALF THE BODY
IS JUST BLACK SCRIBBLE.

12:46.724 --> 12:47.683
- JOSH DIDN'T
GIVE A [bleep].

12:47.766 --> 12:49.310
- WHO'S IN THE TOP?
- JIME.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.145
THE DETAIL IN THE FACE
AND THE CROWN

12:51.228 --> 12:53.272
AND, YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE THING,
I LIKED IT.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.106
- THERE WERE TRICKS
HE PUT IN THERE

12:54.190 --> 12:56.025
TO GIVE THE FEATHERS
SOME DETAIL,

12:56.108 --> 12:58.360
BUT I LIKED
TATU BABY'S BETTER.

12:58.444 --> 13:01.030
- SHE DID THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE
IMAGERY BY FAR.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.240
- I THINK THE MAIN THING
IS JUST HOW CRISP THE EYES LOOK.

13:03.324 --> 13:05.242
THE DETAILS
REALLY STOOD OUT.

13:05.326 --> 13:08.662
BUT KYLE PROBABLY
HAS THE MOST FINE DETAILS.

13:08.746 --> 13:10.414
IT RESEMBLED THE CREATURE.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.415
HE CONCENTRATED HIS EFFORTS
ON THE FACE,

13:11.499 --> 13:13.501
AND IT CAME DOWN
AND JUST MORPHED OUT OF IT.

13:13.584 --> 13:17.004
- KYLE DID PUT TINY BITS
OF DETAIL IN THAT FACE,

13:17.087 --> 13:19.882
WHEREAS BABY HAD A MUCH MORE
RECOGNIZABLE ANIMAL.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.677
- TO ME, IT'S EITHER YOU HIT
A HUGE AREA OF TEXTURE,

13:23.761 --> 13:26.388
OR YOU DO THE BIG,
RECOGNIZABLE IMAGE.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.556
- I THINK WE HAVE
A DECISION.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.767
- YEAH.
- LET'S DO IT.

13:29.850 --> 13:33.270
TODAY, WE ASKED YOU
TO TRANSFORM YOUR MODEL

13:33.354 --> 13:36.065
INTO A WILD ANIMAL
USING INTRICATE DETAIL.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.068
SOME OF YOU
DID AMAZING WORK.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.779
- KYLE, THERE WAS
A LOT OF DETAIL.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.782
THE MOUTH AND THE LITTLE SCALES
WITH TEXTURE UNDERNEATH THEM,

13:44.865 --> 13:47.535
GOOD JOB, MAN.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.411
- BABY, YOU PUT ON
A SEMINAR OUT THERE.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.872
YOU DID A BIG OLD
SUPER RECOGNIZABLE,

13:51.956 --> 13:53.290
BEAUTIFUL PAINTING.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.375
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

IT'S NOT WHAT I WANNA DO,
TO SCREW PEOPLE OVER IN ANY WAY.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.123

AND IN THE WHISKERS.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.605
AS FAR AS THE APPLICATION,

IT CAME DOWN TO WHAT I COULD
DRAW AS FAST AS I COULD.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.969

IS THAT IT DOESN'T FIT

30:46.052 --> 30:47.262
THE SHAPE OF HIS ARM.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.388
IF YOU'RE GONNA DO
THIS BIG CLOUD BACKGROUND,

30:48.471 --> 30:51.099
THAT'S YOUR CHANCE TO MAKE
YOUR IMAGE FIT THE BODY,

30:51.182 --> 30:54.102
AND IF YOUR BACKGROUND ELEMENTS
DON'T FIT TO THE BODY,

30:54.185 --> 30:57.021
WHAT ARE THEY THERE FOR?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.275
- E.S.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.610
- MAN, OH, MAN,

31:02.694 --> 31:04.445
THIS THING'S
GOT A LOT OF DESIGN FLAWS.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.323
- YOU LOST THE SHAPE
OF THE TIGER COMPLETELY.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.284
WHERE THE FIRST PAW
LEADS UP TO THE SHOULDER,

31:09.367 --> 31:11.160
THE SHOULDER
GOES OVER THE EAR.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.912
NOW THE SECOND LUMP
COMING AROUND

31:12.996 --> 31:14.205
SHOULD BE THE NECK,

31:14.289 --> 31:15.790
BUT THE NECK
SEVERS OFF THE HEAD

31:15.873 --> 31:17.834
AND TURNS INTO
ANOTHER SHOULDER.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.210
TIGERS CAN BE
REALLY BEAUTIFUL,

31:19.294 --> 31:20.628
BUT THEY CAN BE
REALLY TRICKY,

31:20.712 --> 31:23.881

OF THE BIRDS.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.642
A LOT OF USE OF NICE DETAIL
IN THE FEATHERS.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.852
BUT THE BACKGROUND,

31:35.935 --> 31:38.813
IT'S JUST A BIG AREA
OF MUTED COLOR.

31:38.896 --> 31:41.649
THIS TATTOO WOULD HAVE BEEN
WAY BETTER WITH ZERO BACKGROUND.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.986
BIRDS, BRANCHES, FLOWERS,
DETAIL.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.155
NAILED IT, SOLID, DONE.
YOU'RE THE WINNER.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.656
CONGRATULATIONS, CRAIG.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.824
INSTEAD, YOU SPENT

31:49.907 --> 31:54.245

31:58.374 --> 31:59.459

IT'S OVERALL DRAWN WELL.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.586

32:02.837 --> 32:04.672
EXTRA LINE WORK
AND LITTLE STUFF LIKE THAT

32:04.756 --> 32:06.299
REALLY MAKES
A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.842

TO THE WIRE,

32:07.925 --> 32:09.719
AND THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT
DIDN'T GET COMPLETELY FINISHED.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.262

32:11.346 --> 32:12.347

LIGHT BLUE IN THERE,

32:12.430 --> 32:14.682

32:14.766 --> 32:16.142

32:16.225 --> 32:18.061
THEN YOU COULD GET YOUR

32:18.144 --> 32:22.231

32:28.112 --> 32:30.531

AND HALF DOWN
IN THE BUTT CRACK

32:31.824 --> 32:34.035
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER--
PFFT.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.704
- NO BUSINESS DOING
THAT MUCH WATER ON SOMEBODY

32:36.788 --> 32:38.873
IF YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.208

AN ARTHRITIC HAND

32:40.291 --> 32:42.710

32:42.794 --> 32:44.128

32:44.212 --> 32:47.090

32:49.926 --> 32:52.136

32:54.138 --> 32:56.265

32:56.349 --> 32:58.434
IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME
YOU HAD TO CRAM IT IN THERE,

32:58.518 --> 32:59.936

ALL I CAN THINK IS,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

33:02.605 --> 33:04.941
- I TRIED TO DO
A 12-HOUR TATTOO IN 6 HOURS.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.068
- EVEN BEFORE YOU HAD
THE TIME CRUNCH OF TATTOOING IT,

33:07.151 --> 33:10.571
THE DRAWING, THE DETAIL
OF THE LION IS NOT THERE.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.407
- I COULD DRAW THAT LION
TOTALLY DIFFERENT,

33:12.490 --> 33:14.575
BUT I WENT WITH
A LOT MORE SIMPLE LION.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.536

33:19.288 --> 33:20.581

33:24.168 --> 33:26.254
COMING THIS TIME AROUND,
I REALLY WANNA SHOW--

33:26.337 --> 33:27.922

33:28.005 --> 33:31.092
IF YOU DON'T DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM YOUR FEARS,

33:31.175 --> 33:33.010
YOU'RE GONNA END UP
OUTING YOURSELF FASTER.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.637
YOU GOTTA
GET YOUR HEAD IN IT,

33:34.721 --> 33:36.806
OR YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GET OUT.

33:36.889 --> 33:39.684

THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

33:39.767 --> 33:41.769

33:41.853 --> 33:44.814

33:46.691 --> 33:50.570
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK

35:50.481 --> 35:51.315

IT KINDA LOOKS

36:06.372 --> 36:07.957

IN A LION COSTUME.

AT WHAT SHE'S WEARING,

36:30.354 --> 36:33.274
THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL SHE PUT
IN THAT IS REMARKABLE.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.276

AREN'T DETAILED AT ALL.
