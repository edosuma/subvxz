00:00.342 --> 00:01.775
Previously on "Heartland":

00:01.843 --> 00:03.777
Ashley:
It's already sold?!

00:03.844 --> 00:05.646
I'm your landlord now!

00:05.713 --> 00:07.380
You bought our place.

00:07.449 --> 00:09.015
I think I need to take
a year off...

00:09.083 --> 00:10.350
a year just to expand
my clinics

00:10.418 --> 00:11.852
and see what I can really do.

00:12.787 --> 00:13.787
Who are you ropin' with?

00:13.855 --> 00:16.021
Hello!
Who do you think?

00:16.958 --> 00:18.357
Jake:
(Chuckles)

00:20.026 --> 00:23.629
I can't stop thinking
about Jake.

00:23.697 --> 00:26.933
Amy, what am I gonna do
about Badger?

00:27.868 --> 00:29.168
Amy: Get up.
(Clicks teeth)

00:29.235 --> 00:31.571
(Horse whinnies and snorts)

00:32.873 --> 00:34.806
(Amy clicks teeth,
horse whinnies)

00:34.874 --> 00:36.307
Get up.
(Clicks teeth)

00:37.242 --> 00:38.543
(Grunts)

00:38.611 --> 00:40.445
All right,
now if I've done my job right,

00:40.513 --> 00:42.280
he should want to come in to me

00:42.348 --> 00:44.816
and reward me with his trust.

00:52.924 --> 00:54.324
(Horse snuffles)

Onlookers:
(Clap)

01:12.710 --> 01:14.577
Now that, folks, is join up.

01:14.645 --> 01:15.645
(Chuckles)

01:15.713 --> 01:17.346
(Quietly) You're a good boy.

01:17.414 --> 01:19.081
All right, we're gonna take
a 15 minute break.

01:19.149 --> 01:20.517
When we come back,

01:20.584 --> 01:22.350
I'll talk about
some sacking out methods.

01:22.418 --> 01:25.453
(Quietly)
Good boy. Yeah.

01:25.522 --> 01:27.088
(Gate clanks open)

01:28.090 --> 01:29.525
That was pretty darn
impressive.

01:29.592 --> 01:30.893
Thank you.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.694
I'm Keith Rowan.
Hi.

01:32.762 --> 01:34.462
I own a spread
not far from here.

01:34.531 --> 01:35.697
Last few years
I've been training

01:35.765 --> 01:37.565
and re-homing
wild mustangs.

01:37.633 --> 01:38.766
You have? Really?

01:38.834 --> 01:40.434
Well, keeps the population
in check,

01:40.502 --> 01:42.369
which keeps the ranchers'
fingers off the triggers,

01:42.437 --> 01:43.604
if you know what I mean.

01:43.672 --> 01:44.839
I do, actually.

01:48.343 --> 01:49.977
but they got nothin' on you.

01:50.045 --> 01:51.278
I'd be mighty grateful

01:51.346 --> 01:52.580
if you could find the time
in your schedule

01:52.648 --> 01:54.848
to show my boys
a few of your techniques.

01:54.916 --> 01:56.416
I'd pay whatever
your going rate is.

01:56.483 --> 01:58.251
I would be happy to.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.385
Well, before you accept,

01:59.453 --> 02:00.754
there's something
you should know.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.557
Prisoners?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.759
You mean like
"Shawshank Redemption"?

02:05.826 --> 02:08.061
Amy: No, it's not like
that at all, guys.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.595
This is a group of prisoners

02:09.663 --> 02:11.229
that come from the Chinook
Correctional Institute

02:11.297 --> 02:12.731
and they bus
to Keith's ranch every day

02:12.799 --> 02:14.232
to work with the mustangs.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.801
Some of them are
really good trainers.

02:15.869 --> 02:18.637
Well, these so-called trainers
are criminals

02:18.705 --> 02:20.539
and I don't want you
anywhere near 'em.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.807
Yeah, I'm with Jack.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.609
There's a reason those guys
are in jail, Amy.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.910
Yes, but they're trying
to change their lives.

02:25.978 --> 02:28.379
Jack: Well, they can change
their lives without you.

02:28.447 --> 02:30.815
Grandpa, I'm doing it.
This is my job.

02:30.883 --> 02:32.249
No.

02:32.317 --> 02:34.686
You can't just say "no."
I'm too old for "no."

02:34.753 --> 02:36.153
Well, how about
"over my dead body"?

02:36.221 --> 02:38.556
You too old for that?

02:42.359 --> 02:45.495
(Rooster crows,
lawnmower starts up)

02:46.764 --> 02:48.298
(Lawnmower whirs loudly)

02:48.365 --> 02:51.735
Ashley: (Groans) Caleb...
Make it stop!

02:51.803 --> 02:53.870
(Lawnmower whirs loudly)

02:58.675 --> 02:59.675
Caleb:
(Sighs)

03:01.544 --> 03:03.445
(Weed eater buzzes loudly)

03:03.513 --> 03:04.847
What the hell?!

03:07.317 --> 03:08.150
Dude!

03:08.218 --> 03:08.985
(Lawnmower whirs loudly)

03:09.052 --> 03:09.919
Hey, buddy!

03:09.987 --> 03:11.253
(Lawnmower shuts down)

03:11.321 --> 03:12.387
7:00 a.M.

03:13.990 --> 03:14.923
7:30.

03:14.991 --> 03:15.924
Yeah, would you cut it out?

03:15.992 --> 03:17.191
My wife's trying to sleep.

03:17.259 --> 03:18.660
You got a problem,

03:18.728 --> 03:20.595
talk to the lady
who signed the work order.

03:20.663 --> 03:21.997
(Paper rustles)

03:23.899 --> 03:25.066
Val Stanton.

03:25.134 --> 03:26.935
(Lawnmower starts up again)

03:27.003 --> 03:28.536
Ty:
So you're sure about this?

03:28.604 --> 03:29.737
Amy:
Yeah, yeah.

03:29.804 --> 03:31.105
Thanks for offering
to come with me.

03:31.172 --> 03:32.606
Ty: Ah, I know you don't
need a chaperone,

03:32.674 --> 03:34.842
but at least your grandpa
will be able to sleep at night.

03:34.909 --> 03:36.409
Amy:
(Chuckles)

03:36.477 --> 03:39.312
Hey, these must be the horses
the inmates are trainin'.

03:39.380 --> 03:40.748
Ty: Yeah, check this guy out.
(Horse snorts)

03:40.815 --> 03:43.083
Amy: Yeah. Easy...
Ty: Ooh.

03:43.151 --> 03:44.952
(Horse snorts nervously)

03:45.020 --> 03:46.119
Ty: Ah, I feel sorry for
whoever has to train him.

03:46.186 --> 03:47.386
(Chuckles)

03:47.454 --> 03:49.889
Keith:
Hey. Glad you could make it.

03:49.957 --> 03:52.358
Hey, Keith.
This is my boyfriend Ty.

03:52.425 --> 03:54.060
Hey, good to meet ya.

03:54.128 --> 03:55.427
Come on,
I'll give you the grand tour.

03:55.495 --> 03:57.063
Sure.

03:57.497 --> 04:00.133
Keith: These guys are my
everyday ranch horses.

04:00.200 --> 04:02.834
The mustangs you saw back there
are new arrivals.

04:02.902 --> 04:04.803
Last year we managed
to find homes

04:04.871 --> 04:06.972
for about a dozen of 'em.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.775
Amy: This place is amazing.
I'm really impressed.

04:09.842 --> 04:10.976
Keith:
The inmates might be doing time,

04:11.044 --> 04:12.778
but they're decent enough guys.

04:12.845 --> 04:14.179
They wouldn't be here
if I didn't trust 'em.

04:14.246 --> 04:15.847
(Gate clangs open)

04:15.915 --> 04:17.315
(Horse whinnies)

04:18.416 --> 04:19.884
(Van rumbles)

04:19.951 --> 04:22.987
Keith: The guys arrive
every day at 8:00 A.M.

04:23.922 --> 04:25.422
The newbies start off
as ranch hands

04:25.490 --> 04:27.858
and work their way up
to trainers.

04:27.926 --> 04:29.459
A couple of the guys
are real naturals,

04:29.527 --> 04:30.728
but I'm hopin'
with your techniques

04:30.796 --> 04:33.263
you'll take 'em
to the next level.

04:33.331 --> 04:34.664
I'll do my best.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.365
Inmate:
Looks like a good day, huh?

04:39.603 --> 04:41.404
Joe:
Ty?

04:41.471 --> 04:42.538
Joe.

04:44.641 --> 04:46.475
What the hell?

04:46.543 --> 04:49.878
Ty Borden rockin'
the cowboy boots.

04:49.946 --> 04:51.213
What's up, buddy,
give me a hug.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.781
Ty:
(Surprised gasp)

04:52.849 --> 04:53.916
Hell really has frozen over.

04:53.983 --> 04:55.217
Look at you.

04:55.284 --> 04:57.452
What're you doin' here?

04:57.520 --> 04:59.287
About five years.

05:00.156 --> 05:03.225
Yeah, three on good behaviour.

05:48.735 --> 05:50.236
Last I heard,

05:50.303 --> 05:54.239
Clint had you working at some ranch.
Yeah, Heartland.

05:54.240 --> 05:55.606
Am still there,
if you can believe it.

05:55.674 --> 05:56.908
No kiddin'?

05:56.976 --> 05:58.243
Ty:
Yeah.

05:58.310 --> 05:59.710
Clint's even got...
(Strains with effort)

05:59.779 --> 06:02.413
One of his new kids
workin' there now.

06:02.481 --> 06:03.481
It's kind of weird, actually.

06:03.548 --> 06:04.883
It makes me feel old.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.985
Clint Riley,
the only probation officer

06:07.052 --> 06:09.254
with a catchphrase.

06:09.321 --> 06:11.721
Joe and Ty: "Duly noted.
" (Laugh)

06:13.557 --> 06:14.658
Yeah.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.395
Hey, do me a favour and uh...

06:18.462 --> 06:21.564
Don't tell Clint
I landed in jail, all right?

06:21.632 --> 06:22.699
Yeah.

06:23.935 --> 06:25.002
What happened, man?

06:25.069 --> 06:27.236
What happened, what happened...

06:27.304 --> 06:29.438
Uh, I was doing really good
for a while.

06:29.506 --> 06:31.573
I was. I had, uh,
had my own place.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.875
Oh yeah?

06:32.943 --> 06:36.645
Had a job doing construction
and then, uh...

06:37.614 --> 06:39.748
Then the recession hit.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.850
Didn't work for a few months
and then...

06:41.918 --> 06:44.085
I started doing jobs
for a friend.

06:44.153 --> 06:45.586
Jobs?

06:45.654 --> 06:47.956
Yeah, "deliveries."

06:48.024 --> 06:49.424
Yeah.

06:49.491 --> 06:50.792
I know, I know,

06:51.727 --> 06:54.296
but the money was so good, man.

06:55.198 --> 06:57.498
Anyways, that's, uh,
that's boring.

06:57.566 --> 06:58.632
How about you, Ty?

06:58.700 --> 07:00.734
You look like
you're doing good, man.

07:00.802 --> 07:02.436
Uh, yeah, I guess.

07:03.338 --> 07:05.372
I'm going back to school.

07:05.440 --> 07:06.841
I'm thinking about
becoming a vet.

07:06.908 --> 07:09.176
A vet?
Yeah.

07:09.244 --> 07:10.845
(Chuckling) A vet.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.047
That's great, man.

07:13.114 --> 07:14.848
That's really good.

07:15.816 --> 07:18.251
I'm proud of you, Ty.

07:18.319 --> 07:19.418
Thanks, man.

07:21.155 --> 07:22.188
Badger: I can't believe
we have to spend the week

07:22.256 --> 07:24.490
picking berries
for some old lady.

07:24.558 --> 07:27.093
You'll like Mrs. bell.

07:27.161 --> 07:29.928
Yeah, well, she won't like me.

07:29.996 --> 07:32.497
Old ladies usually just hit me
with their purses.

07:32.565 --> 07:35.567
Before or after
you try and mug them?

07:35.634 --> 07:37.169
Slow down, hey?

07:38.104 --> 07:40.739
I just wanna get this
over with.

07:40.806 --> 07:42.474
What's with the bad mood?

07:42.541 --> 07:44.542
It's my normal mood.

07:44.610 --> 07:46.077
Does this have something to do
with the phone call

07:46.144 --> 07:47.979
you got this morning?

07:48.046 --> 07:48.980
No.

07:49.047 --> 07:50.514
Well, who was it?

07:50.582 --> 07:51.515
Clint.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.217
What does he want?

07:53.285 --> 07:54.518
What time to pick me up.

07:54.586 --> 07:56.854
Where are you going?

07:56.922 --> 07:58.722
Home.

07:58.790 --> 07:59.790
You're leaving?

07:59.858 --> 08:01.825
Yeah, on Friday.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.095
Just like that, you're leaving?

08:05.162 --> 08:06.363
Summer's over.

08:06.430 --> 08:09.665
It's not like
I really have much choice.

08:11.068 --> 08:13.370
So where is this
crazy old lady?

08:13.437 --> 08:14.871
She's not crazy.

08:15.806 --> 08:18.874
(Bees buzz loudly)
Don't come any closer.

08:18.942 --> 08:21.810
The bees are in
a terrible mood today.

08:21.878 --> 08:23.445
(Bees buzz loudly)

08:28.051 --> 08:30.886
Amy: Now, if he goes to blow
up, just ease way back, okay?

08:30.954 --> 08:32.154
Maintain control
with the halter

08:32.222 --> 08:33.722
and lead rope,

08:33.789 --> 08:34.989
and if he goes to buckin'
just let him get it out, okay?

08:35.057 --> 08:36.823
We don't force anything.

08:36.892 --> 08:37.892
Who wants to give it a try?

08:37.960 --> 08:39.027
Inmate:
Why not?

08:39.094 --> 08:40.461
Amy:
Okay.

08:40.529 --> 08:41.562
All right.

08:41.630 --> 08:42.297
Inmate 2:
Not much to it, eh?

08:42.364 --> 08:43.496
Inmate 3:
Careful.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.799
Good job out there.

08:45.866 --> 08:47.700
Thanks, but I don't think
I'm teaching them anything

08:47.768 --> 08:49.036
they don't already know.

08:49.103 --> 08:51.438
You kiddin'?
The guys are eatin' it up.

08:51.505 --> 08:52.872
They just act like
they know everything.

08:52.941 --> 08:56.009
They don't want a girl
showing 'em up.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.210
All right, that's good.

08:57.278 --> 08:59.646
Now just try
the other side too.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.813
Hey, guys.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.348
Hey.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.950
I see you met Joe.

09:04.017 --> 09:07.253
Uh, yeah, I used to, uh,
I used to know him.

09:07.321 --> 09:08.354
Amy:
So why isn't he out here

09:08.422 --> 09:10.022
with all the rest
of the trainers?

09:10.090 --> 09:13.192
Well, Joe's one of our new guys
so he does mostly ranch work.

09:13.260 --> 09:16.161
Ah, he's pretty smart though.
He'd make a great trainer.

09:16.228 --> 09:18.029
Maybe Amy could,
uh, show him the ropes,

09:18.097 --> 09:19.797
get him started with
one of those mustangs?

09:19.865 --> 09:21.132
I don't know.
I had him working

09:21.200 --> 09:22.867
with a couple
of my more experienced guys

09:22.935 --> 09:24.802
about a month back.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.438
It didn't go well.

09:26.505 --> 09:27.805
What happened?

09:27.873 --> 09:30.875
He's got a lot of fear
and a short fuse.

09:30.943 --> 09:32.076
Not a good combination

09:32.143 --> 09:34.278
when it comes
to horse training.

09:34.346 --> 09:37.914
Ty: Well, maybe Amy could
spend some time with him.

09:37.983 --> 09:39.683
You're more than welcome
to give it a shot.

09:43.188 --> 09:46.656
Val: No, that one goes
on the other side.

09:48.058 --> 09:49.625
I just thought
a few flower pots

09:49.693 --> 09:51.294
would spruce the place up
a little.

09:51.362 --> 09:52.828
You can't just spring
this stuff on us, mom.

09:52.896 --> 09:55.531
Look, we may be renters,
but we have rights.

09:55.599 --> 09:56.899
I think what Ashley
is trying to say

09:56.967 --> 09:58.234
is we would appreciate
a heads-up

09:58.302 --> 09:59.202
on this sort of thing.

09:59.269 --> 10:00.603
And you're absolutely right.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.171
From now on, no more surprises,

10:02.239 --> 10:03.973
I promise.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.140
You know what?

10:05.208 --> 10:06.375
That was better
where it was before.

10:07.776 --> 10:09.177
(Annoyed sigh)

10:09.245 --> 10:10.312
You're gonna have to excuse me.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.246
I gotta keep an eye
on these guys;

10:11.314 --> 10:12.947
they have no taste whatsoever.

10:13.016 --> 10:15.083
I'm standing right here.

10:16.452 --> 10:17.552
Wait'll you see
the water feature

10:17.620 --> 10:19.054
I'm putting in.

10:19.122 --> 10:21.422
It's gonna be so good!

10:22.357 --> 10:23.357
Right this way, dears.

10:23.425 --> 10:25.026
The others have already started.

10:25.093 --> 10:26.394
Mallory:
Others?

10:27.329 --> 10:28.795
Badger:
Great!

10:28.863 --> 10:30.097
Just when I thought this day
couldn't get any worse.

10:31.033 --> 10:33.501
All right
my little worker bees,

10:33.568 --> 10:36.069
I'll "bee" back later
with some refreshments.

10:37.238 --> 10:38.871
(Chortles)

10:39.407 --> 10:43.676
Badger: Gee, I hope it's
tea and digestive cookies.

10:44.711 --> 10:46.346
Jamie: Did you guys see
those bee hives back there?

10:46.414 --> 10:49.215
Yeah, since when does
Mrs. bell keep bees?

10:49.283 --> 10:51.317
We should totally go check
out the hives later.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.552
No way.
If I get stung,

10:53.619 --> 10:56.088
I'll swell up
like a watermelon.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.990
Badger:
Yeah, I'd love to see that.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.325
Two points!

11:00.393 --> 11:02.561
Yeah, let's just get to work.

11:02.628 --> 11:04.863
Here, you'll need this.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.598
Thanks, Jake.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.733
(Branch snaps)

11:10.402 --> 11:12.470
Joe: Look, I've tried the horse
training thing before, guys.

11:12.538 --> 11:13.971
I'm just no good at it.

11:14.039 --> 11:16.006
Well, how come you're in
this program then?

11:16.075 --> 11:18.842
Well, it gets me out of prison
during the days.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.078
I don't mind the work.

11:20.145 --> 11:21.845
I'm getting pretty handy
with manure.

11:21.913 --> 11:24.847
Well, horse training's
all about taking control.

11:24.915 --> 11:27.050
You're a natural leader.
You can do this.

11:27.118 --> 11:28.918
Thanks, buddy,
but I don't know.

11:28.986 --> 11:30.120
I think it would take a miracle

11:30.188 --> 11:31.455
to make me into a trainer,
you know?

11:31.522 --> 11:32.689
Well, they don't call Amy
"the miracle girl"

11:32.756 --> 11:33.690
for nothin'.

11:33.757 --> 11:35.525
(Snorts)

11:35.593 --> 11:36.993
Okay, Joe.

11:37.061 --> 11:39.062
I want you to take
a look around,

11:39.130 --> 11:40.729
pick a horse
that's right for you

11:40.797 --> 11:42.164
and don't think
about it too much.

11:42.232 --> 11:43.732
Just use your instincts.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.034
Right, my instincts.

11:50.340 --> 11:51.707
(Horse snuffles)

11:53.643 --> 11:54.776
(Hooves clop)

12:02.618 --> 12:05.487
(Horse whinnies and snorts)

12:06.422 --> 12:07.688
That one.

12:07.756 --> 12:09.357
I don't know about
that one, Joe.

12:09.425 --> 12:11.159
He seems a little...
(Horse whinnies and snorts)

12:11.227 --> 12:13.160
No, he's definitely the one.

12:13.228 --> 12:14.294
(Horse snorts)

12:16.431 --> 12:17.498
(Chuckles)

12:21.969 --> 12:23.570
(Horse snorts loudly,
hooves pound)

12:23.638 --> 12:25.105
Joe:
Come on, let's go!

12:25.173 --> 12:26.306
Move it.

12:27.242 --> 12:28.241
Move it.
(Horse whinnies shrilly)

12:28.308 --> 12:29.242
Come on.

12:29.309 --> 12:30.943
(Horse snorts loudly)

12:32.379 --> 12:34.213
Come on, let's go!

12:34.281 --> 12:36.115
Amy: That's good.
Keep him movin'.

12:36.183 --> 12:37.916
Joe: Yeah, I'm gettin'
a little dizzy.

12:38.852 --> 12:40.753
Amy: That's all right,
just focus on the horse.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.920
Keep him moving.

12:41.988 --> 12:43.055
Joe: Come on!
Move it! Let's go!

12:43.123 --> 12:44.656
Come on, buddy, let's go!
Come on!

12:44.723 --> 12:46.057
Come on, let's go!
(Loud echoing clank)

12:46.125 --> 12:48.026
Younger Joe:
Let's go!

12:49.428 --> 12:51.563
Come on, buddy, let's go.

12:52.498 --> 12:54.166
All right, come on.

12:58.304 --> 12:59.237
Younger Ty:
(Grunts)

12:59.305 --> 13:00.671
(Glass shatters)

13:00.738 --> 13:02.173
Younger Joe:
Come on.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.940
Go, go, go.

13:04.008 --> 13:05.209
Amy:
Okay, now slow him down.

13:05.277 --> 13:06.910
Joe:
I'm trying.

13:07.379 --> 13:10.214
Amy: Take the pressure off, okay?
Just use your voice.

13:10.282 --> 13:11.915
Joe:
Whoa, buddy.

13:11.983 --> 13:13.050
Whoa!

13:14.018 --> 13:15.219
It's not working!

13:15.287 --> 13:17.320
Just stay calm, Joe.

13:17.388 --> 13:18.454
Joe:
Whoa!

13:18.789 --> 13:20.456
(Grunts and thumps)

13:24.027 --> 13:25.695
Amy: You okay?
Joe: Yeah.

13:25.762 --> 13:26.796
Amy: That was good
for your first try.

13:26.863 --> 13:28.231
He just got a little bit
wound up.

13:28.299 --> 13:29.332
Oh, no kidding.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.833
He's trying to kill me!

13:30.901 --> 13:31.967
If he picks up on your fear,

13:32.035 --> 13:33.935
he's gonna test
your boundaries.

13:34.003 --> 13:36.871
Yeah?
Tell someone who cares.

13:36.939 --> 13:38.973
Joe, come on, man.
Don't worry about that.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.542
Yeah, I suck with horses,
all right?

13:40.610 --> 13:41.710
It's your first day.

13:41.777 --> 13:42.711
Come on, you'll get this.

13:42.778 --> 13:43.845
Whatever.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.246
It'll go better tomorrow.

13:46.314 --> 13:48.148
Look, I want you to stop, okay?

13:48.216 --> 13:49.515
I get you used to look up
to me or whatever

13:49.584 --> 13:50.550
at the group home,

13:50.618 --> 13:52.185
but we're not kids anymore.

13:52.252 --> 13:54.821
I'm just trying to help.
I don't want your help!

13:55.756 --> 13:57.857
I'm real happy
you're doing so well, Ty,

13:57.925 --> 13:59.158
I am,

13:59.226 --> 14:00.293
but having you around,

14:00.360 --> 14:01.227
it just makes me feel
like a loser.

14:01.295 --> 14:03.897
Listen, Joe-
no, you listen!

14:03.965 --> 14:05.397
Shoveling crap
and group showers,

14:05.465 --> 14:08.266
that's pretty much my life now,

14:08.334 --> 14:11.003
and training some horse
isn't gonna change that.

14:11.071 --> 14:13.305
You need to lay off.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.128
Hey, we should all go
see a movie tonight.

14:21.580 --> 14:22.680
Maybe get a bite first.

14:22.747 --> 14:24.648
Mallory:
Sure. Sounds fun.

14:24.716 --> 14:26.049
Badger: Yeah, I'll
probably call it a night,

14:26.117 --> 14:27.184
but you go.

14:33.924 --> 14:35.592
What is your problem?

14:35.659 --> 14:36.892
First, you tell me
you're leaving

14:36.960 --> 14:38.794
and then you bail
on this double date?

14:38.862 --> 14:40.963
I don't do double dates.

14:41.031 --> 14:42.898
Okay, then we'll do
something else.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.266
(Sighs) Whatever.

14:44.334 --> 14:45.634
I'm exhausted.

14:45.702 --> 14:46.702
Let me know
when Jack gets here.

14:46.769 --> 14:48.770
Jake and Jamie:
(Laugh)

14:49.905 --> 14:50.905
(Laugh)

14:58.981 --> 15:00.147
Amy: You know, I hate to admit it,

15:00.215 --> 15:01.815
but I think Keith's right
about Joe.

15:01.883 --> 15:03.451
He just...

15:03.518 --> 15:05.286
He seems too impatient
to gentle a mustang.

15:05.354 --> 15:07.788
He just needs time, okay?
Give him a chance.

15:07.856 --> 15:08.956
I don't know.

15:09.023 --> 15:10.523
I mean, he doesn't seem
that into it.

15:10.591 --> 15:11.825
He will be.

15:11.893 --> 15:13.093
Well, I don't want to force him

15:13.161 --> 15:14.795
into something that
he doesn't want to do.

15:14.863 --> 15:16.830
I think I know Joe pretty well.

15:16.898 --> 15:19.967
Can we just try again
tomorrow please?

15:20.034 --> 15:23.269
Why is this
so important to you?

15:24.304 --> 15:26.773
I owe Joe a few favours.

15:26.840 --> 15:27.907
Okay?

15:39.351 --> 15:41.186
Jack:
You're up late.

15:41.254 --> 15:43.088
Couldn't sleep.

15:43.156 --> 15:45.690
So I hear you're leaving us.

15:45.758 --> 15:47.058
Yup.

15:47.126 --> 15:48.994
End of the week.

15:49.929 --> 15:51.196
So what're your plans

15:51.264 --> 15:54.265
after you head back
to the city?

15:54.332 --> 15:56.133
I don't know.

15:56.201 --> 15:58.202
I'll be eighteen
in a couple months,

15:58.270 --> 15:59.670
out of the system by then.

16:01.273 --> 16:04.374
I figure I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

16:04.442 --> 16:06.343
Well, that doesn't sound
like much of a plan.

16:06.411 --> 16:07.744
How about I talk to Clint

16:07.813 --> 16:10.413
and maybe you could stay on here
for a while?

16:10.480 --> 16:12.348
No offence, but...

16:12.416 --> 16:16.686
I think I've had enough
of the ranch life for a while.

16:16.753 --> 16:17.987
Yeah, fair enough.

16:18.923 --> 16:21.090
You know, I don't pretend
to be an expert,

16:21.158 --> 16:23.592
but I'm pretty sure
these drawings aren't half bad.

16:23.660 --> 16:26.295
You ever thought about
studying art?

16:26.362 --> 16:27.830
Yeah, sure.

16:29.098 --> 16:30.098
The only way to get
into art school

16:30.166 --> 16:33.468
is to finish high school first.

16:33.536 --> 16:34.669
Considering I've been
kicked out

16:34.737 --> 16:37.906
of pretty much every school
in Calgary,

16:37.974 --> 16:40.508
I don't really see
that happening.

16:40.576 --> 16:43.510
(Warning beeps from a truck
backing up)

16:43.578 --> 16:45.412
Ashley: (Groaning sigh) Caleb!

16:45.480 --> 16:47.614
Caleb: (Frustated) Argh!
What now?

16:50.585 --> 16:52.320
Val:
Keep comin'!

16:52.387 --> 16:53.321
(Truck beeps)

16:53.388 --> 16:55.022
Come on!
Little more!

16:55.457 --> 16:57.658
Caleb: I thought your mother
said no more surprises.

16:57.726 --> 16:59.125
Ashley:
She lied.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.029
Look, I know you tried to be
polite with her yesterday,

17:03.097 --> 17:05.298
but that does not work
with my mother.

17:05.366 --> 17:06.733
Yeah?

17:06.800 --> 17:07.867
You got a better plan?

17:07.935 --> 17:09.336
Look, the only way
to deal with her

17:09.403 --> 17:11.037
is through guilt and fear.

17:11.105 --> 17:13.473
And if that doesn't work:
Screaming.

17:13.540 --> 17:15.207
No.

17:15.275 --> 17:17.541
Like it or not,
she's our landlord now.

17:17.609 --> 17:18.810
If things go South,

17:18.878 --> 17:20.444
then we're out
on the street, so...

17:20.512 --> 17:24.183
You just let me
handle it, all right?

17:25.617 --> 17:26.685
(Door opens)

17:29.989 --> 17:31.655
Ty:
You got that saddle on wrong.

17:31.723 --> 17:35.726
You keep pulling on that cinch
he's gonna kick.

17:45.204 --> 17:49.306
Joe: I think I get why you want
me to go all mustang whisperer.

17:49.374 --> 17:52.509
This whole horse thing
straightened you out and...

17:52.576 --> 17:53.977
You think a dose
of the same medicine

17:54.045 --> 17:56.579
might do me some good.

17:56.647 --> 17:58.315
Am I right?

17:59.250 --> 18:03.585
Well, it didn't sound
as stupid in my head.

18:03.653 --> 18:07.390
Well, I got myself
into this mess, Ty;

18:08.858 --> 18:12.761
I'm the only one
who can get myself out.

18:14.264 --> 18:16.365
Hey...
(Chuckles)

18:16.433 --> 18:18.366
You remember that, uh...

18:18.434 --> 18:19.700
That crazy homeless guy

18:19.768 --> 18:21.769
who used to hang out
by the group home?

18:21.837 --> 18:24.205
Guy was convinced
he was a Saudi prince.

18:24.273 --> 18:26.274
Bob the Saudi prince.

18:26.342 --> 18:27.875
Yeah, I remember him.

18:27.944 --> 18:29.344
Always swigging
that wild turkey

18:29.412 --> 18:31.879
and yelling at the top
of his lungs:

18:31.948 --> 18:34.381
"One day I'll be king!"

18:36.384 --> 18:40.520
I repeat that same line
to myself everyday.

18:42.057 --> 18:44.524
"One day I'll be king."

18:45.994 --> 18:47.894
In here,

18:47.963 --> 18:51.464
today and tomorrow
pretty much suck.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.801
One day, that's all I got.

18:57.838 --> 18:59.538
Look, man,

18:59.606 --> 19:00.873
don't give up on this
horse training thing,

19:00.941 --> 19:02.842
all right?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.111
You saw me out there, I stink.

19:05.179 --> 19:07.946
Ah, you just need
some practice.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.448
All right.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.918
Three to five years,
you'll be a real pro.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.687
You punk.

19:15.754 --> 19:16.989
(Laughs)

19:23.962 --> 19:24.895
Jake:
Hey.

19:24.963 --> 19:25.829
Jamie:
(Giggles)

19:25.897 --> 19:26.998
Jake:
Hey!

19:27.065 --> 19:28.466
Jamie:
(Giggles)

19:30.068 --> 19:31.935
This sucks.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.971
I can't wait to get back
to my real life.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.639
Your real life?

19:35.707 --> 19:37.808
Yeah, in Calgary.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.376
Okay, if being here with me

19:39.443 --> 19:41.177
isn't a part of your real life,

19:41.245 --> 19:43.746
then why am I wasting
my time with you?

19:43.814 --> 19:45.482
You know, I'm the one
wasting my time.

19:45.549 --> 19:46.682
You're a jerk!

19:46.750 --> 19:48.151
Oh, I'm the jerk?

19:48.219 --> 19:50.320
Yeah, I wish you'd never even
come to Heartland!

19:50.388 --> 19:51.821
No you don't.
Yes I do!

19:51.889 --> 19:53.256
No, you don't,
because you know what?

19:53.324 --> 19:54.589
If I never came to Heartland,

19:54.657 --> 19:55.790
who would you be using
to make Jake jealous?

19:55.858 --> 19:57.359
What are you talking about?

19:57.427 --> 19:59.028
You know, maybe we should
start making out right now.

19:59.095 --> 20:00.429
I'm sure it would
drive him insane.

20:00.497 --> 20:01.730
Stop it!

20:01.797 --> 20:03.665
Don't act so innocent.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.834
I overheard you talking to Amy.

20:05.902 --> 20:08.904
I know you're all about Jake.

20:08.971 --> 20:09.971
And in my opinion

20:10.039 --> 20:13.041
that kind of makes you
the jerk.

20:17.446 --> 20:18.513
Mallory!

20:20.582 --> 20:22.316
Lou, all I want to do

20:22.384 --> 20:24.785
is scan the damn picture
into the computer,

20:24.853 --> 20:27.120
but it keeps telling me
my teeth are blue.

20:27.188 --> 20:28.821
What does that mean?

20:28.889 --> 20:33.026
Blue teeth, bluetooth,
it's all Greek to me, Lou.

20:34.995 --> 20:37.397
What's that?
Say that again.

20:38.699 --> 20:41.168
I can't understand a word
you're sayin'.

20:41.235 --> 20:44.636
Who is that talking
in the background?

20:44.704 --> 20:46.072
Call to prayer?

20:47.174 --> 20:48.541
Well, tell 'em to pray for me

20:48.608 --> 20:50.409
'cause divine intervention
is the only way

20:50.477 --> 20:51.810
I'm gonna figure this one out.

20:54.781 --> 20:55.981
Val:
Those go here.

20:56.049 --> 20:57.783
No, those. Here.

20:59.651 --> 21:00.751
So I'm thinking of planting
an herb garden

21:00.819 --> 21:01.819
over there by the fence.

21:01.887 --> 21:03.121
That could be fun, huh?

21:03.189 --> 21:04.755
Super fun.

21:04.823 --> 21:07.292
Ashley:
Uh, just out of curiousity,

21:07.359 --> 21:10.428
how many projects
do you have planned exactly?

21:10.496 --> 21:12.797
Well, gardening is a start.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.166
This trailer has got to go.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.334
I don't know,

21:17.402 --> 21:18.935
but I can tell you one thing:

21:19.003 --> 21:20.237
By the time I'm finished
with this place

21:20.305 --> 21:21.671
it'll be worthy of a Stanton.

21:21.739 --> 21:22.939
(Small laugh)

21:23.007 --> 21:24.241
Maybe it's not worthy
of a Stanton,

21:24.309 --> 21:25.442
but I'm an Odell now

21:25.510 --> 21:28.011
and this trailer
suits me just fine.

21:28.079 --> 21:31.347
Ashley, you can't be serious.

21:31.415 --> 21:32.948
I mean, roughing it
can have its charms,

21:33.016 --> 21:35.751
kind of like backpacking
across Europe, I guess,

21:35.819 --> 21:37.019
but I can tell you right now

21:37.087 --> 21:38.687
the thrill of living
in this dump,

21:38.755 --> 21:40.389
it's gonna wear off
pretty quickly.

21:40.457 --> 21:42.492
I can't believe
how closed-minded you are.

21:42.559 --> 21:44.960
I didn't raise you
to live like this.

21:45.028 --> 21:46.561
I raised you to have
a sense of self-worth.

21:46.629 --> 21:49.097
I do have a sense
of self-worth,

21:49.165 --> 21:51.766
which is why I'm not gonna
let you push me around anymore.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.101
(Dismissive laugh)

21:53.169 --> 21:55.137
I've been reading up
on Hudson renter rights

21:55.204 --> 21:58.072
and you can't just show up here
whenever you want.

21:58.141 --> 21:59.307
Is that a fact?

21:59.375 --> 22:01.243
Landlords are required by law

22:01.310 --> 22:02.643
to give their tenants
written notice

22:02.710 --> 22:06.113
twenty-four hours
before entering the property.

22:06.181 --> 22:07.748
(Angry huff)

22:09.751 --> 22:11.452
Okay.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.355
If it's a written notice
you want,

22:14.422 --> 22:17.858
that's exactly
what you're gonna get.

22:18.792 --> 22:20.527
Amy: That's real good.
You're doing great.

22:20.594 --> 22:22.295
Just keep him at a steady pace.

22:22.363 --> 22:24.030
Joe:
Come on.

22:24.097 --> 22:25.331
Come on!

22:25.399 --> 22:27.600
Amy:
Now just stay calm, okay?

22:27.668 --> 22:29.636
That's really good, Joe.
Just keep him going.

22:29.703 --> 22:30.903
Come on, keep it together.

22:32.706 --> 22:34.040
Younger Joe:
Keep it together, buddy.

22:34.107 --> 22:35.607
Younger Ty: (Loud clanking) Whoa!

22:35.675 --> 22:36.941
Younger Joe: (Police
siren sounds) Stay calm.

22:37.009 --> 22:38.177
Younger Ty:
(Loud bang) Oh!

22:38.244 --> 22:39.311
Younger Joe:
Calm down. Come here.

22:39.379 --> 22:40.579
Amy:
Just calm down, okay?

22:40.647 --> 22:42.013
He's picking up on your fear.

22:42.081 --> 22:43.248
(Horse snorts)

22:45.185 --> 22:46.618
Joe:
No, screw this!

22:46.686 --> 22:48.019
He's got it in for me!

22:48.087 --> 22:50.454
Pull the plug.
The horse is too riled up.

22:50.522 --> 22:52.756
Can I just try somethin'?

22:52.824 --> 22:53.757
Yeah.

22:53.825 --> 22:55.125
Amy:
(Sighs)

22:55.194 --> 22:56.594
Come on now.
(Clicks teeth)

22:56.662 --> 22:59.963
Wssshhht!
(Clicks teeth) Get up!

23:00.031 --> 23:01.098
(Horse snorts)

23:03.902 --> 23:05.135
(Clicks teeth)

23:12.310 --> 23:13.376
(Horse snorts)

23:32.995 --> 23:34.062
No way.

23:35.398 --> 23:36.632
Come here.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.166
You're kiddin', right?

23:38.234 --> 23:40.968
I'm dead serious.
Get over here.

23:44.106 --> 23:45.172
Good boy.

23:46.475 --> 23:47.542
Good boy.

23:52.748 --> 23:53.814
Here.

24:00.221 --> 24:02.021
(Horse snorts softly)

24:04.726 --> 24:06.793
(Surprised exhale)

24:10.664 --> 24:13.599
Amy:
So whatcha gonna name him?

24:13.667 --> 24:15.067
How 'bout, uh...

24:16.002 --> 24:18.704
How about Bob the Saudi prince?

24:20.540 --> 24:21.607
(Laughs)

24:23.009 --> 24:24.310
Joe:
(Chuckles)

24:24.378 --> 24:25.444
Amy:
Good boy.

24:28.414 --> 24:30.548
Badger:
Mallory!

24:31.484 --> 24:33.551
Come on, where'd you go?

24:34.620 --> 24:36.621
(Grunts in frustration)

24:38.157 --> 24:39.223
(Bees buzz)

24:45.196 --> 24:46.263
Cool.

24:46.831 --> 24:47.898
(Bees buzz)

24:52.203 --> 24:53.771
(Bees buzz loudly)

25:01.144 --> 25:02.211
Mallory!

25:04.948 --> 25:06.282
(Hand slap) Ah!

25:11.153 --> 25:13.855
(Grass rustles, hard thump)

25:13.923 --> 25:16.257
(Wheezes and gasps for air)

25:25.343 --> 25:27.577
Mrs. bell: Mallory, I was
just about to have some tea.

25:27.644 --> 25:28.911
Why don't you join me?

25:28.978 --> 25:31.380
I didn't mean to interrupt.

25:31.448 --> 25:34.850
Oh, don't be silly.
Sit down.

25:36.687 --> 25:38.521
Look, try the tea
with some of my honey.

25:38.589 --> 25:40.489
The only thing better
is my jam.

25:44.159 --> 25:47.128
So tell me, dear,
which boy is it?

25:48.063 --> 25:49.464
Excuse me?

25:49.532 --> 25:50.699
You don't have to beat
around the bush with me;

25:50.766 --> 25:54.603
you can cut the tension
out there with a knife.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.838
Well...

25:56.905 --> 25:59.173
It's kinda both, actually.

25:59.241 --> 26:01.875
Everything's really messed up.

26:02.810 --> 26:05.312
I'm gonna be alone
for the rest of my life.

26:05.380 --> 26:07.981
I wasn't much older than you
when I lost my Thomas.

26:08.049 --> 26:11.318
I thought I was gonna be alone
for the rest of my life too.

26:11.386 --> 26:13.354
But then Mr. bell
came along, right?

26:13.421 --> 26:15.988
Oh yes, but many years later.

26:16.056 --> 26:17.823
Were you lonely?

26:17.891 --> 26:19.659
A little.

26:19.727 --> 26:21.494
But I knew I couldn't
let being alone

26:21.562 --> 26:24.930
stop me from doing
all the things I wanted to do.

26:24.998 --> 26:28.601
So I went ahead
and I became a rodeo queen,

26:28.669 --> 26:30.803
travelled to Japan.

26:30.871 --> 26:33.705
I even climbed
mount Kilimanjaro.

26:33.773 --> 26:35.907
Wow! That's amazing.

26:35.975 --> 26:38.009
I was the bee's knees.

26:38.077 --> 26:40.812
And then,
when Mr. bell came along,

26:40.880 --> 26:43.248
it was a happy surprise.

26:43.316 --> 26:46.318
So no more talk of being alone.

26:47.219 --> 26:48.919
I promise you, Mallory,

26:48.987 --> 26:50.254
there are many adventures

26:50.322 --> 26:54.292
and many, many happy
surprises to come,

26:54.359 --> 26:56.059
boys or no boys.

26:56.127 --> 26:57.528
(Teacups clink)

27:01.032 --> 27:02.232
Now, easy.

27:02.301 --> 27:03.366
He's a little bit
sensitive there, okay?

27:03.434 --> 27:05.502
So just take the pressure off
if he reacts.

27:05.569 --> 27:06.603
Right.

27:06.671 --> 27:08.405
How do you put up with him?

27:08.472 --> 27:09.339
Well, it takes a lot
of patience

27:09.407 --> 27:11.207
to gentle a mustang.

27:11.275 --> 27:13.410
Not the horse, Ty.

27:13.477 --> 27:14.844
(Laughs)

27:15.780 --> 27:17.314
Well, um,

27:17.381 --> 27:20.516
we've had our ups and downs,
but we make it work.

27:20.583 --> 27:22.718
I can tell he's crazy about ya.

27:22.786 --> 27:25.554
I'm pretty crazy about him too.

27:25.622 --> 27:28.824
Well, he lucked out, didn't he?

27:28.891 --> 27:30.659
Job, school,

27:31.594 --> 27:33.061
the pretty girl.

27:33.129 --> 27:35.797
He's really got it all.

27:35.864 --> 27:36.831
You know, Joe,
it's getting late.

27:36.898 --> 27:38.800
I gonna go check in with Keith.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.335
Yeah, okay.

27:40.402 --> 27:42.570
I'm just gonna stay, uh...
I'll stay here with him,

27:42.638 --> 27:44.071
work with him a bit more.

27:44.139 --> 27:45.606
Okay, sure.

27:52.847 --> 27:54.013
Good work.

27:54.081 --> 27:56.316
Let's check on the others.

27:59.086 --> 28:00.420
(Truck rumbles)

28:08.862 --> 28:10.128
Caleb:
What is this?

28:10.196 --> 28:12.197
Ashley:
Ah, probably just another bill.

28:12.265 --> 28:15.133
Caleb:
This is an eviction notice.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.536
(Door bangs shut) What?!

28:17.604 --> 28:19.071
Are you serious?!

28:19.138 --> 28:20.973
You said something to your mom,
didn't you?

28:21.040 --> 28:22.575
No!

28:22.642 --> 28:24.308
Ashley...

28:24.377 --> 28:27.178
Okay, so I had a conversation.

28:27.246 --> 28:28.145
(Sighs)

28:28.213 --> 28:29.481
Did I or did I not tell you

28:29.548 --> 28:30.648
that I was gonna
take care of it?

28:30.716 --> 28:32.417
Well, you didn't.
And besides,

28:32.485 --> 28:34.018
I just told her that
she couldn't show up here

28:34.086 --> 28:35.920
without a written notice!

28:35.988 --> 28:39.123
Written notice for an eviction.

28:40.291 --> 28:42.058
(Exasperated sigh)

28:42.126 --> 28:46.129
Jack: Please tell me you
know what blue teeth are.

28:46.197 --> 28:47.598
Val: Why don't we just stick
to old-fashioned wires.

28:47.665 --> 28:49.266
No blue teeth involved, okay?

28:49.333 --> 28:51.902
Amen to that.
You want coffee?

28:51.969 --> 28:53.136
Yeah, please.

28:54.071 --> 28:55.471
Actually, Jack,

28:55.539 --> 28:57.673
I am really glad
you called me today.

28:57.741 --> 28:58.674
Jack:
Oh?

28:58.742 --> 28:59.809
Val:
Yeah.

29:01.144 --> 29:03.379
Ashley's driving me crazy.

29:04.681 --> 29:06.282
Of course what else is new,
right?

29:06.349 --> 29:07.983
Jack:
(Chuckles)

29:08.051 --> 29:09.585
I don't know how you do it,
Jack.

29:09.653 --> 29:11.186
Jack:
Do what?

29:11.254 --> 29:12.554
Val:
Your grandkids.

29:12.622 --> 29:14.623
They listen to you,
they respect you...

29:14.690 --> 29:16.858
Jack: Well, yeah, I
hope they respect me,

29:16.926 --> 29:19.160
but they certainly don't always
listen to me.

29:19.228 --> 29:20.228
Val:
Sure they do.

29:20.296 --> 29:21.763
Well, if that were true,

29:21.831 --> 29:23.264
Lou wouldn't have married
an oil guy

29:23.332 --> 29:25.400
and Amy wouldn't be off teaching
a bunch of criminals

29:25.468 --> 29:27.302
to gentle mustangs.

29:27.369 --> 29:29.102
And doesn't that drive
you crazy?

29:29.170 --> 29:31.104
Yeah, sometimes.

29:31.172 --> 29:33.040
But, well, they're adults now.

29:33.107 --> 29:34.341
They have to make
their own decisions

29:34.409 --> 29:35.709
and their own mistakes.

29:35.777 --> 29:38.679
The best I can hope for
is that they're happy.

29:38.747 --> 29:41.214
I guess.
(Scanner whirs)

29:41.282 --> 29:43.716
(Gasps) Look at that!
We have lift-off!

29:43.784 --> 29:46.052
Val, you are a genius!

29:46.119 --> 29:47.787
(Laugh, slap hands)

29:50.925 --> 29:52.826
Mallory: Hey, have you
guys seen Badger?

29:52.893 --> 29:54.994
He left a while ago.

29:55.062 --> 29:57.229
Said he was gonna look for you.

29:57.297 --> 29:59.798
Jake:
He's probably taking a nap.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.633
I think I'm gonna go
look for him.

30:01.701 --> 30:03.368
I'm coming too.

30:03.436 --> 30:06.338
I'm sick of picking berries.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.109
Come on!

30:19.785 --> 30:20.852
Go on.

30:43.808 --> 30:47.210
(Horse whinnies,
chain clanks on fence)

30:49.846 --> 30:51.514
Hi-yah! Come on!
(Horses whinny loudly)

30:51.581 --> 30:54.182
Get! Get!
(Horse hooves thunder)

30:54.250 --> 30:55.317
Come on!

30:57.754 --> 30:59.154
(Horse hooves thunder)

31:00.089 --> 31:01.857
(Horse whinnies)

31:01.925 --> 31:03.191
Keith:
What the hell?

31:03.259 --> 31:06.394
(Horses whinny loudly,
hooves thunder)

31:09.297 --> 31:11.565
Keith:
Come on, guys, go get 'em!

31:11.633 --> 31:14.467
Inmates:
(Shout to each other)

31:14.536 --> 31:15.869
(Horses whinny)

31:25.413 --> 31:27.046
Mallory:
Where is he?

31:27.113 --> 31:29.114
Jamie:
Maybe he hitchhiked home.

31:29.182 --> 31:30.583
(Bees buzz loudly)

31:33.554 --> 31:35.354
Badger:
(Coughs and gasps)

31:35.422 --> 31:36.488
Mallory:
Badger?

31:36.557 --> 31:38.758
I told you he was taking a nap.

31:38.825 --> 31:40.125
Badger:
(Wheezes and coughs)

31:40.193 --> 31:41.827
Badger, are you okay?

31:41.895 --> 31:44.362
Badger:
(Coughs)

31:44.430 --> 31:46.197
Mallory: What's wrong?!
What's happening?!

31:46.265 --> 31:47.198
Badger!

31:47.266 --> 31:48.232
(Strained inhale)

31:48.300 --> 31:51.335
Oh my God.
He's totally dying!

31:51.403 --> 31:53.071
He's having
an allergic reaction.

31:54.006 --> 31:56.041
Badger:
(Wheezes and gasps)

31:56.108 --> 31:57.175
(Coughs)

31:58.110 --> 31:59.910
(Grimaces and grunts)

32:04.382 --> 32:06.050
He's gonna be fine.

32:09.353 --> 32:10.754
(Inhales deeply)

32:12.457 --> 32:13.591
How'd the horses get out?

32:13.658 --> 32:15.491
I don't know.

32:15.559 --> 32:17.159
Is that Joe?

32:21.732 --> 32:22.599
Ty!

32:22.666 --> 32:23.600
Ty, what are you doing?

32:23.667 --> 32:24.934
I'm going after him.

32:25.002 --> 32:26.603
No, Ty, this is crazy!
We've gotta tell Keith.

32:26.670 --> 32:27.870
No, Amy, you don't understand!

32:27.938 --> 32:29.438
I do understand!
This is crazy!

32:29.506 --> 32:31.807
I can't just rat him out!
I owe him more than that.

32:31.874 --> 32:34.342
What do you owe him?

32:34.410 --> 32:36.044
Everything.
Now let go.

32:39.148 --> 32:40.215
Hi-yah!

32:44.420 --> 32:46.488
(Horse hooves thunder)

32:53.348 --> 32:54.415
Ty:
Joe!

33:03.057 --> 33:04.457
Pull up!

33:04.525 --> 33:06.093
(Horse hooves echo)

33:06.160 --> 33:07.961
(Police siren wails)

33:09.897 --> 33:10.831
Younger Joe:
Door! Try it, try it.

33:10.898 --> 33:12.499
Go, go!

33:12.566 --> 33:14.367
(Horse hooves thunder)

33:14.435 --> 33:15.401
(Police siren wails)

33:15.469 --> 33:16.970
Younger Ty:
No, it's locked!

33:17.038 --> 33:18.938
Younger Joe: All right, all
right, all right. Come on.

33:19.006 --> 33:20.239
Give me your foot.

33:21.174 --> 33:22.274
Come on, buddy, get in!
Get!

33:22.342 --> 33:23.308
(Police siren arrives)

33:23.376 --> 33:24.143
Younger Ty:
Here, here!

33:24.210 --> 33:25.344
(Police siren squacks)

33:25.411 --> 33:26.512
Come on! Joe!

33:29.449 --> 33:30.616
Younger Joe:
Get outta here!

33:30.684 --> 33:32.284
Go, now! Get!

33:34.353 --> 33:35.754
Police officer:
Don't move!

33:35.821 --> 33:36.888
Turn around.

33:38.090 --> 33:40.125
Hands behind your head.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.660
(Handcuffs click)

33:43.095 --> 33:44.996
(Horse hooves thunder)

33:47.800 --> 33:50.134
Ty: Pull up!
Joe: Get outta here, Ty!

33:50.201 --> 33:51.268
Ty:
Pull up!

33:54.405 --> 33:55.605
(Horse whinnies)

33:55.674 --> 33:57.941
Ty and Joe:
(Grunt and thump hard)

34:01.546 --> 34:03.346
Joe:
(Grunts in pain)

34:05.383 --> 34:07.083
Ty:
What are you doing, man?!

34:07.151 --> 34:08.083
You gotta go back!

34:08.152 --> 34:09.152
I can't go back.

34:09.219 --> 34:10.719
Five years, man,
I can't do that.

34:12.089 --> 34:13.956
Look, I'm sure it's really nice
living on some fancy farm

34:14.024 --> 34:14.956
with a pretty girlfriend,

34:15.025 --> 34:16.092
but that's not in my future!

34:16.159 --> 34:19.495
If you run away,
you have no future.

34:19.563 --> 34:21.397
What happened to "one day"?

34:21.464 --> 34:24.032
One day?
One day is a lie.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.168
No, it's not.

34:26.235 --> 34:27.467
I'm proof that it's not.

34:27.536 --> 34:29.437
No, I'm not you!

34:30.840 --> 34:33.675
Where are you gonna go, man?

34:34.110 --> 34:35.777
I don't know!

34:38.313 --> 34:39.513
(Sighs heavily)

34:40.415 --> 34:43.117
Everything's so messed up,
buddy.

34:43.185 --> 34:44.985
You remember that night...

34:45.053 --> 34:47.121
Before I left for heartland?

34:47.188 --> 34:48.723
We broke into that brewery?

34:48.790 --> 34:50.925
Yeah, yeah, I remember.

34:50.992 --> 34:52.092
The cops chased us

34:52.159 --> 34:54.761
and I got away, thanks to you,

34:54.829 --> 34:57.663
and you spent a year
in detention.

34:57.732 --> 35:00.100
I never felt right about that.

35:00.167 --> 35:02.668
Well, there's nothing
you could've done, Ty.

35:02.737 --> 35:06.272
If I would have got
arrested that night,

35:07.208 --> 35:09.942
I never would have
made it to Heartland;

35:10.009 --> 35:12.510
I never would have met Amy.

35:13.446 --> 35:17.082
My whole life
would have been different.

35:17.150 --> 35:18.917
You don't know that.

35:19.853 --> 35:21.253
Yes, I do.

35:22.622 --> 35:24.422
I owe you, man.

35:25.691 --> 35:27.424
I owe you big.

35:29.527 --> 35:30.795
(Panting)

35:31.696 --> 35:34.165
So I'm not gonna leave you
this time,

35:34.233 --> 35:36.400
even if I have to drag you
behind my horse.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.269
(Laughs weakly)

35:40.806 --> 35:43.006
Ah, sure.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.776
Give me your hand.

35:45.843 --> 35:46.576
Come on.

35:46.644 --> 35:47.978
(Violent punch)

35:48.045 --> 35:49.112
Sorry, buddy.

35:52.116 --> 35:53.917
Ty:
(Grunts)

35:53.985 --> 35:55.318
(Heaving grunt)

35:56.954 --> 35:58.387
(Groans)
Agh! Get off of me, Ty!

35:58.454 --> 35:59.922
Ty: What the hell is
wrong with you, man?!

35:59.990 --> 36:01.723
Joe:
(Breathing hard)

36:08.564 --> 36:11.633
The girls went to go get help.

36:12.402 --> 36:14.535
I didn't even know
I was allergic to bees.

36:17.639 --> 36:19.841
Thanks for, uh, well...

36:19.909 --> 36:20.975
Yeah.

36:23.145 --> 36:26.181
So if you used
your epipen, uh...

36:26.248 --> 36:27.748
What happens if you get stung?

36:32.086 --> 36:34.822
Two boots, two epipens.

36:34.889 --> 36:35.956
(Chuckles)

36:38.960 --> 36:40.027
Look...

36:40.962 --> 36:43.163
For what it's worth,

36:45.200 --> 36:48.034
you're the one
Mallory cares about,

36:48.101 --> 36:49.168
not me.

36:51.638 --> 36:53.505
I guess the better man won.

36:58.946 --> 37:01.347
What're you doing, man?

37:02.348 --> 37:04.449
Joe:
(Sighs)

37:04.516 --> 37:06.184
I don't know.

37:07.119 --> 37:10.121
I had a girl back in Calgary.

37:12.325 --> 37:15.760
She was pregnant
when I got arrested,

37:15.828 --> 37:18.662
now she won't have anything
to do with me.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.266
She had a boy;
I have a son.

37:25.936 --> 37:28.739
I don't want to be like my dad,
you know.

37:28.806 --> 37:30.474
I don't want to, uh,

37:32.343 --> 37:33.543
I don't want to miss
all the important stuff

37:33.611 --> 37:36.012
because I'm stuck in prison.

37:38.416 --> 37:40.516
So what are you gonna do?

37:40.584 --> 37:41.917
(Sighs heavily)

37:43.253 --> 37:44.387
I don't know.

37:46.022 --> 37:47.523
If you get caught,

37:48.458 --> 37:49.625
you won't see your son

37:49.693 --> 37:52.528
until he's old enough
to hate you.

37:53.963 --> 37:55.297
If you go back,

37:56.232 --> 37:57.499
three years from now,

37:57.566 --> 37:59.434
you might still have
a chance with him.

37:59.502 --> 38:00.802
(Sighs heavily)

38:03.338 --> 38:05.006
But it's your call.

38:15.617 --> 38:18.018
Guard: We've got
everyone except for Joe.

38:18.085 --> 38:19.286
Keith:
Did you check the barn?

38:19.353 --> 38:20.821
Guard:
I checked everywhere.

38:23.792 --> 38:25.692
Ty: (Quietly) Good boy.

38:26.628 --> 38:28.094
Joe:
Thanks, man.

38:31.398 --> 38:32.398
(Spits)

38:34.000 --> 38:35.601
Sorry I'm late.

38:35.669 --> 38:38.571
When nature calls, you know.

38:41.475 --> 38:43.242
Cutting it a little close,
don't you think?

38:43.310 --> 38:44.643
(Relieved sigh)

38:44.710 --> 38:46.711
Thanks for all your
hard work today, Amy.

38:46.779 --> 38:48.012
No problem.

38:49.214 --> 38:51.316
So, did you have
a nice ride with Joe?

38:51.383 --> 38:52.884
Oh, we were just uh...

38:52.952 --> 38:54.519
Don't waste your breath.

38:54.587 --> 38:55.921
I've been around long
enough to know

38:55.988 --> 38:57.489
that sometimes when
you're breaking a horse,

38:57.557 --> 39:00.925
you have to break
the rider first.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.194
See you two tomorrow.

39:20.495 --> 39:22.129
I wanted to apologize.

39:22.197 --> 39:23.430
For what?

39:23.498 --> 39:27.268
I haven't been acting
like myself all summer

39:27.335 --> 39:30.336
and I didn't want it
to seem like I don't care,

39:30.404 --> 39:32.071
because I do.

39:33.540 --> 39:34.908
And I wanted to tell you
that...

39:34.975 --> 39:36.709
um...

39:36.777 --> 39:40.346
Jamie and I are sort of...
You know.

39:41.381 --> 39:42.448
Oh.

39:44.617 --> 39:46.318
That's okay, actually,

39:46.385 --> 39:51.256
because I have to climb
mount Kilimanjaro on my own.

39:55.228 --> 40:00.031
You're a great guy, Jake,
and Jamie's a lucky girl.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.537
You're welcome here anytime.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.672
I'm sure Ashley didn't mean
what she said.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.108
(Dismissive sigh)
She meant every word.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.177
Ashley hasn't changed
since she was twelve.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.879
She's still a petulant,
ungrateful child.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.948
Careful, that's my wife.

40:18.015 --> 40:20.183
She's not ready to be
anybody's wife.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.918
Ah, you'd be wrong then.

40:21.986 --> 40:24.387
(Patronizing laugh,
light chest slaps)

40:24.455 --> 40:26.022
Just you wait.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.623
You know, the first three years
of any relationship,

40:27.691 --> 40:28.791
that's the honeymoon.

40:28.860 --> 40:30.660
After that things get tougher.

40:30.728 --> 40:32.862
And when this marriage
falls apart,

40:32.929 --> 40:34.529
who do you think
she's gonna come running to?

40:35.465 --> 40:36.598
(Surprised gasp)

40:36.666 --> 40:38.067
I am Ashley's husband.

40:38.134 --> 40:39.368
So from now on,

40:39.435 --> 40:41.636
you're gonna treat me
with respect,

40:41.704 --> 40:44.340
and you're gonna treat Ashley
with respect too.

40:44.407 --> 40:47.176
Otherwise you're just gonna have
no place in our life.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.077
And if you choose to evict us,

40:49.144 --> 40:50.811
I'm gonna move Ashley
so far from Hudson

40:50.880 --> 40:54.349
the only time you'll ever
see her is on Facebook.

40:54.416 --> 40:55.483
Yeah.

40:59.121 --> 41:00.755
One more thing:

41:00.822 --> 41:02.456
Just get that ugly,
granny-looking fountain

41:02.524 --> 41:04.291
out of my yard.

41:07.428 --> 41:08.495
(Door opens)

41:13.701 --> 41:15.502
(Nervous sigh)

41:25.279 --> 41:26.345
(Sighs)

41:27.514 --> 41:28.981
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:31.484 --> 41:33.819
(Horse hooves thud lightly)

41:36.188 --> 41:37.255
Whoa, buddy.

41:38.057 --> 41:39.124
Easy there.

41:40.059 --> 41:41.126
Easy.

41:48.067 --> 41:49.801
(Clicks teeth) Let's go.

41:50.736 --> 41:52.469
Atta boy, Bob.

41:56.474 --> 41:58.409
(Happy chuckle) Right?

41:59.344 --> 42:00.477
Feels pretty good.

42:00.545 --> 42:01.745
(Nervously) Uh, all right.

42:05.817 --> 42:09.552
Jack: Were you planning on
saying goodbye before you left?

42:09.619 --> 42:10.753
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
give Ty a call

42:10.821 --> 42:13.689
when I get back to the city.

42:13.757 --> 42:15.925
Goodbyes aren't really
my style.

42:15.993 --> 42:17.994
Yeah, well, I get that.

42:19.796 --> 42:21.364
What's this?

42:23.167 --> 42:25.600
Greenwest High School
for visual and performing arts?

42:25.668 --> 42:26.801
Yeah, I, uh...

42:26.869 --> 42:28.136
I hope you don't mind,

42:28.204 --> 42:31.239
but I sent some
of your drawings over there.

42:31.307 --> 42:33.408
They liked what they saw.

42:33.476 --> 42:34.776
Said they were willing
to take a chance

42:34.844 --> 42:38.313
on your less than stellar
school record.

42:38.381 --> 42:39.814
You should talk to them
about late enrollment

42:39.882 --> 42:41.082
if you're interested.

42:41.149 --> 42:42.616
I... this is...

42:43.986 --> 42:45.086
T-thank you.

42:45.153 --> 42:46.553
Yeah, I figure that
working on a ranch

42:46.621 --> 42:49.590
and getting through school
have two things in common:

42:49.657 --> 42:53.160
Hard work and dealing
with a lot of crap.

42:53.228 --> 42:55.929
Well, you got the crap
part down.

42:55.997 --> 42:59.132
The hard work?
I'm not so sure.

43:01.702 --> 43:04.904
But it'll come if you want it.

43:04.972 --> 43:06.373
Thank you.

43:08.575 --> 43:09.742
Good luck.
