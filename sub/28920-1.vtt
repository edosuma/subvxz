WEBVTT

00:52.285 --> 00:53.618
Please stop drinking!

00:53.620 --> 00:56.187
It's an affront to God!

00:59.559 --> 01:02.727
Don't you start with that
God shit again, Alberta!

01:02.729 --> 01:04.696
You're destroying us
with your blasphemy!

01:04.697 --> 01:07.599
What about
you, you fucking bitch?

01:11.805 --> 01:14.639
You are never here, I
raise our son on my own!

01:14.641 --> 01:18.243
Up, up in that church
flirting with those men!

01:18.245 --> 01:20.211
You're a fucking hypocrite!

01:20.213 --> 01:21.713
I do no such thing!

01:21.715 --> 01:22.547
But I tell you this,

01:22.549 --> 01:25.550
the men who go to church
and give themselves to God

01:25.552 --> 01:28.153
are more man than
you'll ever be!

01:30.924 --> 01:32.524
Robert?

01:52.512 --> 01:57.348
The devil has blinded
the mind of my husband.

01:57.484 --> 02:02.020
Please Lord, let the light of
the glorious gospel of Christ,

02:02.022 --> 02:05.857
who is the image of
God, shine upon him.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.630
Robert,

02:12.632 --> 02:13.865
please!

02:14.201 --> 02:15.733
Let me talk to you!

02:15.869 --> 02:17.836
Why did you hit my mother?

02:18.171 --> 02:20.471
I, I, I didn't mean it.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.006
It was an accident.

02:26.012 --> 02:28.313
Don't lie, you do
it all the time!

02:28.315 --> 02:32.550
I'll, I'll stop it
now, I promise you.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.819
Everything's gonna be all right.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.925
Forgive his soul

02:40.927 --> 02:43.494
for he is a sinner, my Lord.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.265
And forgive the soul of my son

02:47.367 --> 02:50.602
for he is an innocent
in all of this.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.704
Come inside.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.340
I hate you, I wish
you were dead!

03:07.187 --> 03:12.156
Oh Jesus, no, my baby!

03:13.727 --> 03:16.628
<i>Help Robert
to remain faithful</i>

03:16.630 --> 03:20.965
<i>until death, and allow
his soul to be reborn.</i>

03:25.438 --> 03:27.805
Oh Jesus.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.440
I'm so sorry.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.009
I name you...

04:39.279 --> 04:39.978
Robert.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.812
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.747
Which is?

06:23.483 --> 06:26.751
I believe the
condition is terminal.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.393
How long?

06:36.329 --> 06:39.363
I've seen some miracles
over the years...

06:39.365 --> 06:42.100
Forget the miracles.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.434
How long?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.636
Three months,

06:45.638 --> 06:46.871
maximum.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.174
Stoichkov.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.201
Thank you, Doctor.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.670
The Czar appreciates
your candor.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.440
But as I'm sure
you can appreciate,

07:22.909 --> 07:25.209
he would like to
be left alone now.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.544
Of course.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.850
Doctor?

07:42.996 --> 07:45.496
Why did you do that?

07:46.266 --> 07:49.066
The Czar wants a second opinion.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.015
Vodka.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.051
What the fuck is this?

10:20.053 --> 10:24.021
This is...

10:24.023 --> 10:26.757
This is your jugular vein.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.393
And if I cut it,

10:29.395 --> 10:33.164
you will be dead in
a matter of minutes.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.100
Now,

10:37.303 --> 10:39.603
hand me over that gun.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.607
Good.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.880
You see that chair over there?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.884
Take a seat.

10:54.887 --> 10:56.087
Slowly.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.163
Are you going to kill me?

11:06.165 --> 11:08.366
If I was going to kill you,

11:08.368 --> 11:11.569
I would have killed you already.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.439
Now, please do not
let me ask you again.

11:16.275 --> 11:17.575
Take a seat.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.988
Put your hands behind your back.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.454
Now tell me,

12:04.056 --> 12:05.723
what is your name?

12:06.125 --> 12:07.958
Vladimir.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.361
Vladimir.

12:10.363 --> 12:11.962
What's so funny?

12:11.964 --> 12:15.933
Well, I have lived in the
Soviet Union now for a decade,

12:15.935 --> 12:19.670
and this is the first time
I've met a man called Vladimir

12:19.672 --> 12:21.472
who has a German accent.

12:21.474 --> 12:25.376
Given your German accent,
I'm sure you would know.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.845
Yes, you have to forgive me now.

12:27.847 --> 12:33.350
Because of my age, my mind is
not quite what it used to be.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.352
Tell me.

12:36.289 --> 12:37.688
Do I know you?

12:37.957 --> 12:39.690
I don't think so.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.663
What is your name?

12:46.566 --> 12:47.832
Adler.

12:50.436 --> 12:53.170
No, you're right,

12:53.172 --> 12:54.972
I do not know you.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.742
But it is becoming
apparent you do know me.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.079
What do you know, tell me?

13:02.615 --> 13:06.484
In Germany during the war,
you were a wanted man.

13:06.486 --> 13:10.754
We diverted considerable
resources into finding you.

13:10.756 --> 13:14.959
It was considered one of our
most embarrassing failures.

13:15.595 --> 13:19.597
And do you know how and
why I became a wanted man?

13:19.599 --> 13:23.868
You stole a book which
gives life to the inanimate.

13:23.870 --> 13:25.970
Absolutely incorrect.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.105
I did not steal the book.

13:28.107 --> 13:30.975
It came into my
possession by chance.

13:30.977 --> 13:34.879
And the soldiers you killed,
was that by chance too?

13:34.881 --> 13:37.848
They were by no means soldiers.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.519
They were dirty,
evil nasty bastards.

13:41.587 --> 13:45.155
So, what's your next
move here, kill me?

13:46.425 --> 13:47.625
No.

13:48.895 --> 13:53.597
I think it's time you and
I played a little game.

13:53.699 --> 13:56.433
Do you know Russian Roulette?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.702
Yes.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.138
Very good.

14:06.579 --> 14:08.712
Then you will know

14:08.848 --> 14:13.884
that I will fire this
pistol at you three times.

14:13.886 --> 14:19.023
And if, by chance, you manage
to avoid a single bullet

14:19.025 --> 14:20.424
in the barrel

14:21.027 --> 14:23.460
on all three occasions,

14:26.766 --> 14:29.633
I will simply let you go.

14:34.974 --> 14:37.775
How can I trust
you'll keep your word?

14:37.777 --> 14:41.145
Now, you trust me to let you go,

14:41.147 --> 14:43.380
and I trust you to leave me be.

14:43.382 --> 14:48.352
But we can't forget, you
are a Nazi war criminal,

14:48.354 --> 14:49.720
and the authorities

14:49.722 --> 14:53.757
would much rather you
apprehended than me.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.227
So, what is it to be?

14:59.332 --> 15:00.864
I will.

15:01.801 --> 15:03.233
You will?

15:03.769 --> 15:05.035
Good.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.205
So, let the games begin.

15:08.808 --> 15:10.107
Why is this necessary?

15:10.109 --> 15:13.110
I've already said
I'd leave you alone.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.913
Now, just let me go!

15:16.148 --> 15:19.783
Now where would be
the fun in that?

15:20.653 --> 15:23.387
Stop this and let me go!

15:49.448 --> 15:53.150
This is the final
roll of the dice.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.519
Now open your mouth.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.590
Open your mouth!

16:15.841 --> 16:18.275
Yes.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.481
Ooh,

16:24.483 --> 16:27.151
lucky, lucky, lucky boy!

16:28.120 --> 16:29.620
Now let me go!

16:30.890 --> 16:32.222
Well, yes.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.958
I did promise you
that, didn't I?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.293
Yes!

16:38.097 --> 16:40.497
But the trouble is, you see,

16:42.468 --> 16:43.500
Robert

16:43.502 --> 16:45.903
made no such promise.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.206
Who the hell is Robert?

17:43.929 --> 17:47.831
Why do you still have
dolls in your room?

17:47.833 --> 17:50.768
Aren't you a little
old for that?

17:53.239 --> 17:55.239
When I, uh,

17:55.241 --> 17:56.874
was growing up,

17:57.510 --> 17:59.943
these, uh, dolls,

18:00.312 --> 18:03.747
they were the only
friends I had.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.922
Anyway.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.326
I would like you to take a
flight to Kaliningrad tomorrow.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.263
The Baltic Region?

18:19.965 --> 18:22.065
Why do I need to go there?

18:22.268 --> 18:25.936
I want you to pay a
visit to Ivan Troitsky.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.438
What's he said now?

18:28.440 --> 18:31.809
He's talking to an
English newspaper, huh.

18:32.845 --> 18:37.080
Used words like
"suppression of democracy."

18:37.483 --> 18:40.184
I want you to take care of it.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.418
Why me?

18:42.021 --> 18:45.122
He has a weakness
for beautiful women.

18:46.358 --> 18:49.293
If he is alerted
to your presence,

18:49.995 --> 18:54.498
you could charm him
far easier than I.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.533
I see.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.206
You leave tomorrow afternoon.

22:31.350 --> 22:34.684
Ahh.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.555
Good evening, ladies
and gentlemen.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.091
I'm so very, very grateful

22:41.093 --> 22:44.761
for you to make it to
make it to tonight's show.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.632
Now, it is my greatest pleasure

22:48.634 --> 22:50.500
to welcome on stage

22:50.502 --> 22:53.703
The Enchanted Dolls:

22:53.705 --> 22:54.871
Robert,

22:54.873 --> 22:56.339
Miss Cyclops,

22:56.675 --> 23:01.044
and Kalashnikov.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.111
Yes?

24:41.113 --> 24:44.447
Mr. Meyerhold?

24:44.516 --> 24:47.984
Yes, one
minute, one minute.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.957
What is it?

24:53.959 --> 24:57.894
Good evening, my name is Olga.

24:57.896 --> 25:02.132
I've always had a great
interest in dolls.

25:02.901 --> 25:06.536
Your show is amazing.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.939
Why thank you very much.

25:08.941 --> 25:12.209
I really do appreciate that.

25:12.277 --> 25:15.145
I don't want to disturb you.

25:15.147 --> 25:17.614
I just have one question.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.683
Of course.

25:20.052 --> 25:24.554
How do you get your
dolls to move so freely?

25:25.490 --> 25:29.292
I did not see any
strings or rods.

25:30.262 --> 25:33.396
My darling,

25:33.398 --> 25:38.902
you would never ask a magician
to reveal his tricks now,

25:38.904 --> 25:40.270
would you?

25:40.272 --> 25:42.906
I suppose not.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.779
I really am very tired
after tonight's show.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.148
I should be getting home now.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.050
But I thank you for coming, and

25:54.052 --> 25:58.088
I really am very glad
you enjoyed the show.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.191
Thank you for speaking with me.

26:02.461 --> 26:03.793
Good night.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.429
Good night, Olga.

26:22.147 --> 26:26.483
We do not hold greed
as his template.

26:26.618 --> 26:30.553
We are in this
house and we share.

26:30.555 --> 26:31.454
Now,

26:31.456 --> 26:35.392
all those people outside,
they may think and call us

26:35.394 --> 26:38.228
many, many, many things.

26:38.797 --> 26:43.300
But your papa never
taught you to be greedy.

26:44.503 --> 26:48.238
We share our food, our toys,

26:48.240 --> 26:49.939
and most of all...

26:50.942 --> 26:52.275
our love.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.112
Now,

26:56.114 --> 26:58.048
Papa's not that
angry at the moment,

26:58.050 --> 27:00.550
but he can get ferocious.

27:01.486 --> 27:05.255
Robert, get Papa a cup of tea.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.259
And a biscuit.

27:35.620 --> 27:37.153
How was the trip?

27:37.155 --> 27:39.122
Interesting.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.157
And Troitsky?

27:41.159 --> 27:45.061
He won't be talking
to anyone anymore.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.430
Good.

27:48.633 --> 27:49.966
Very good.

27:50.302 --> 27:54.003
I notice you returned a
day later than planned.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.406
Any particular reason?

27:56.408 --> 28:00.877
Yes, I decided to
watch a theater show,

28:00.946 --> 28:03.413
at my own expense of course.

28:04.483 --> 28:06.082
I suppose the need to relax

28:06.084 --> 28:08.985
after business is
understandable.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.389
You don't understand, Stoichkov.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.259
This was no ordinary show.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.994
How do you mean?

28:18.397 --> 28:21.030
The show was called

28:21.032 --> 28:22.999
"The Enchanted Dolls."

28:23.235 --> 28:26.970
You and your dolls again, huh?

28:28.273 --> 28:30.240
These were very different.

28:30.242 --> 28:34.444
They moved independently,
no puppetry.

28:34.913 --> 28:38.281
I think maybe you had
too much wine, Olga.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.418
I was stone cold sober.

28:45.257 --> 28:49.325
This show was hosted by a man

28:49.327 --> 28:53.329
called Sergey Meyerhold.

28:53.331 --> 28:57.600
I tried to speak to
him at the theater,

28:57.736 --> 29:00.703
but he was not receptive.

29:01.973 --> 29:03.606
I followed him home,

29:03.608 --> 29:07.477
and I saw him interact
with the dolls.

29:07.579 --> 29:12.248
They moved as if they
were living beings.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.287
Sounds outlandish.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.489
Why are you telling me this?

29:19.791 --> 29:23.059
If he can get dolls to life,

29:23.895 --> 29:27.130
perhaps he can use his powers

29:27.132 --> 29:30.700
to help The Czar avoid death.

29:31.470 --> 29:34.704
If it works on
inanimate objects,

29:34.706 --> 29:38.942
surely it could work
on human beings too?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.681
Interesting.

29:46.685 --> 29:51.254
You must understand,
I am very skeptical.

29:51.389 --> 29:54.524
It could simply have been
a form of magic trick

29:54.526 --> 29:56.092
or an illusion.

29:56.761 --> 29:59.696
I know what I saw,

29:59.698 --> 30:01.698
and it was no illusion.

30:01.700 --> 30:06.703
And you say the man's
name was Meyerhold?

30:08.273 --> 30:11.841
Interestingly, though, he had

30:11.977 --> 30:14.577
a German accent.

30:16.948 --> 30:20.583
A Soviet name with
a German accent?

30:22.554 --> 30:23.820
Okay.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.690
Look into it,

30:31.563 --> 30:34.597
and let me know what you find.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.176
Right, my lovely children.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.379
It is time we said goodnight.

32:08.126 --> 32:10.093
Comrade Herzog.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.261
Do you have the money?

32:13.465 --> 32:16.299
No time for formalities I see.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.702
We agreed on 50,000 rubles.

32:27.979 --> 32:31.414
Not until you give
us what we want.

32:34.052 --> 32:35.218
I want the money first.

32:35.220 --> 32:37.620
You're in no position
to give orders, Herzog.

32:37.622 --> 32:43.126
Escaped Nazis usually aren't
treated with such generosity.

32:43.495 --> 32:47.697
I am sure you'll
consider what I tell you

32:48.166 --> 32:49.966
to be of great value.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.802
We'll be the judge of that.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.671
Where would you like to begin?

32:54.673 --> 32:57.707
The man living in Kaliningrad

32:57.809 --> 33:01.344
under the name Sergey Meyerhold.

33:01.413 --> 33:04.747
Your men said that you
know his real identity.

33:05.383 --> 33:06.749
Amos Blackwood.

33:07.452 --> 33:08.251
He is a...

33:08.253 --> 33:12.422
toymaker from the German
region of Bavaria.

33:12.424 --> 33:16.159
In 1939, one of my
superior officers

33:16.161 --> 33:19.862
acquired a book from
Joseph Von Hammersmark.

33:19.864 --> 33:21.831
The book contains
a collection of

33:21.833 --> 33:23.700
spells and mystical teachings.

33:23.702 --> 33:29.572
In 1941, the book was stolen
from Nazi headquarters by a

33:29.574 --> 33:33.276
turncoat with a vendetta
against the Fuhrer.

33:33.445 --> 33:39.082
Somehow, Amos Blackwood came
into possession of the book.

33:39.084 --> 33:43.052
This book, what is
so special about it?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.288
For one thing,

33:45.623 --> 33:47.190
there are spells within it

33:47.192 --> 33:50.660
which can bring inanimate
objects to life.

33:50.662 --> 33:52.495
That many of the
spells in the book

33:52.497 --> 33:54.697
deal with the
resurrection of the dead.

33:54.699 --> 33:58.835
Some say the recipient
of certain spells

33:59.304 --> 34:02.572
will be granted eternal life.

34:02.674 --> 34:04.273
So, what you are saying is

34:04.275 --> 34:09.478
that a book can bring
someone back from the dead?

34:09.481 --> 34:13.049
Or even allow someone
to live forever?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.016
That is right.

34:25.597 --> 34:28.697
<i>I want you to
travel to Kaliningrad tomorrow</i>

34:28.699 --> 34:30.166
<i>and visit the Toymaker.</i>

34:30.168 --> 34:33.101
<i>First, offer him
the 50,000 rubles</i>

34:33.103 --> 34:36.672
<i>to come to Moscow
and work with us.</i>

34:36.674 --> 34:38.241
<i>If he's not receptive,</i>

34:38.243 --> 34:40.943
<i>just kill him and take the book.</i>

34:51.688 --> 34:53.922
Good afternoon, Mr. Meyerhold.

34:53.925 --> 34:58.127
You gave me a fright
there, my dear.

34:58.129 --> 34:59.395
How can I help you?

34:59.397 --> 35:01.397
I didn't mean to frighten you.

35:01.399 --> 35:03.766
I'm Olga, remember?

35:03.768 --> 35:06.269
We met a week ago.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.236
Ah!

35:07.238 --> 35:08.371
Olga.

35:08.373 --> 35:08.938
Yes.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.940
How can I help you?

35:11.009 --> 35:13.743
I work for Josef Stalin.

35:13.945 --> 35:18.381
The Czar, he is very
sick at the moment,

35:18.383 --> 35:23.853
and we believe that you
can aid in his recovery.

35:25.056 --> 35:26.322
What?

35:27.425 --> 35:28.758
The Czar?

35:29.561 --> 35:32.395
Tell me how I can help, my dear.

35:32.697 --> 35:36.432
With the power of your book.

35:39.504 --> 35:40.503
The book?

35:40.505 --> 35:45.041
There is no need to play
games, Mr. Blackwood.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.810
We know who you are.

35:47.812 --> 35:51.380
We know what that book can do.

35:51.916 --> 35:54.283
All we are seeking to do

35:54.385 --> 35:57.520
is to make a business
deal with you.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.322
I have

35:59.691 --> 36:02.758
50,000 rubles I can offer.

36:02.760 --> 36:06.529
All you have to do is come
back to Moscow with me

36:06.531 --> 36:10.666
and use the power of
that book on the Czar.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.134
Ah.

36:12.136 --> 36:14.270
50,000 rubles.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.139
That is a lot of money.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.308
So, you will accept?

36:19.944 --> 36:21.444
Absolutely not.

36:21.446 --> 36:27.083
I must say, I do
admire your... honesty.

36:27.085 --> 36:30.253
This show is long finished.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.759
That leaves me only one option.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.968
Where is the book?

36:46.971 --> 36:51.474
I do not know what
you're talking about.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.411
I do have your home address.

36:55.413 --> 37:01.617
Perhaps I will find it there.
Say goodbye, Blackwood.

37:09.861 --> 37:14.096
What are you
going to do, little man?

37:14.098 --> 37:17.366
I'm afraid your
blanks won't hurt me.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.474
<i>Scheisse.</i>

38:00.912 --> 38:02.812
But, you're...

38:03.581 --> 38:04.814
You're...

38:04.816 --> 38:06.349
You're dead.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.584
I killed you!

38:09.687 --> 38:13.389
Everything about
the book you heard,

38:14.225 --> 38:17.960
it was true.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.663
Come in.

38:59.203 --> 39:00.069
Petrov.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.438
- Romanov.
- Yes sir.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.741
We have a problem.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.344
Olga is currently
deployed in Kaliningrad

39:08.346 --> 39:10.713
seeking a high-risk target.

39:10.782 --> 39:14.183
She was scheduled to call
in more than five hours ago

39:14.185 --> 39:16.052
and has failed to do so.

39:16.054 --> 39:19.255
As you know, this is
unprecedented for her.

39:19.257 --> 39:20.956
Indeed, it is, sir.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.959
We will fly to
Kaliningrad immediately.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.328
Olga shared
information concerning

39:26.330 --> 39:29.265
two locations the high-risk
target frequented.

39:29.267 --> 39:33.769
If she needs support,
then we will provide it.

39:33.771 --> 39:35.104
Yes, sir.

39:36.274 --> 39:38.074
You are dismissed.

40:00.998 --> 40:02.498
Okay.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.067
Take the stairs,

40:05.069 --> 40:06.135
I will check down here.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.703
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

40:07.705 --> 40:08.838
Go.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.114
Go to the second address.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.716
Now!

40:53.718 --> 40:56.585
I want that fucking
Toymaker captured!

40:56.587 --> 40:58.053
Understood, sir.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.566
Okay, my children,
it is time to go,

41:10.568 --> 41:14.570
and I know this is not your
preferred method of travel,

41:14.572 --> 41:19.375
but you just have to be good,
be quiet, and stay still.

41:20.611 --> 41:21.877
Okay.

41:22.713 --> 41:24.914
Shh, quiet now.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.685
Either you come
with us willingly,

42:02.687 --> 42:05.521
or we'll drag your
corpse out of here.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.256
Make your choice.

42:07.558 --> 42:09.158
Yes.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.292
Yes, of course, gentlemen.

42:10.294 --> 42:14.063
Of course, I will come
with you willingly.

42:14.165 --> 42:17.833
But please tell me,
where is it we're going?

42:17.835 --> 42:21.971
We'll be boarding a
private flight to Moscow.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.206
Now where is the book?

42:26.844 --> 42:28.010
The book?

42:28.012 --> 42:28.978
It's foolish of you to pretend

42:28.980 --> 42:31.914
you don't know what
I'm talking about.

42:31.916 --> 42:35.985
That book is the only
thing keeping you alive.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.922
It's in the safe over there.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.260
Petrov, try it.

42:52.403 --> 42:54.336
The numbers to the lock.

42:55.206 --> 42:56.338
Tell me.

42:57.875 --> 42:58.841
Aye.

42:58.843 --> 43:01.143
Stalling will get you nowhere.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.578
If you don't give
us the numbers,

43:02.580 --> 43:06.181
we'll simply kill you
and crack safe ourselves.

43:06.951 --> 43:11.987
The way I see it, gentlemen,
as soon as you have the book,

43:11.989 --> 43:13.856
you will kill me anyway.

43:14.659 --> 43:18.260
We have orders to bring
you along with the book.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.561
Contrary to what you believe,

43:19.563 --> 43:23.732
we want to work with
you, not against you.

43:24.068 --> 43:25.567
Of course.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.837
That's exactly what
the Nazis said.

43:28.839 --> 43:32.241
Stop wasting our
time you old fuck!

43:32.243 --> 43:32.908
Just remember,

43:32.910 --> 43:35.144
I've forgotten more
about inflicting pain

43:35.146 --> 43:36.945
than you'll ever know!

43:39.283 --> 43:41.116
Yes, of course.

43:46.023 --> 43:48.090
23 to the left.

43:48.392 --> 43:50.025
Four to the right.

43:51.862 --> 43:53.629
Three to the left.

44:04.108 --> 44:07.576
Now, Mr. Toymaker, are you
going to travel quietly,

44:07.578 --> 44:11.647
or do we have to tie you up
and put you in the <i> bagazhnik?</i>

44:11.649 --> 44:14.717
No need for that,
gentlemen, no need at all.

44:14.719 --> 44:17.453
I will come with
you fine and dandy.

44:17.455 --> 44:20.756
But please, let me
ask you one thing.

44:20.758 --> 44:21.457
What's that?

44:21.459 --> 44:24.693
If I'm going to be away
from home for a long time,

44:24.695 --> 44:26.662
I need a fresh set of clothes.

44:26.664 --> 44:30.532
Please, gentlemen, they're
just upstairs in the bedroom.

44:30.534 --> 44:31.600
We don't have time for that.

44:31.602 --> 44:35.270
Please, the suitcase
is already packed.

44:35.272 --> 44:38.974
That's all I have
to do is pick it up.

44:39.577 --> 44:42.611
Petrov, get his suitcase.

44:47.451 --> 44:50.085
Thank you very much.

45:10.574 --> 45:12.174
This is not a hotel.

45:12.176 --> 45:14.610
You carry your own
fucking luggage.

45:14.612 --> 45:15.978
Absolutely.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.280
- Are we leaving?
- Yes.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.349
But one thing before we do.

45:20.351 --> 45:21.717
Ow!

45:24.021 --> 45:25.454
Was that really necessary?

45:25.456 --> 45:26.688
He's about 100 years old.

45:26.690 --> 45:28.824
What the hell is he going to do?

45:28.826 --> 45:30.459
Why take a chance?

45:30.461 --> 45:33.962
Help me carry this piece
of shit to the car.

46:02.226 --> 46:05.861
I heard you didn't
come willingly?

46:06.096 --> 46:09.631
It took a little coercion, sir.

46:10.000 --> 46:11.900
Quiet Romanov.

46:12.870 --> 46:16.038
This old man can
speak for himself.

46:17.208 --> 46:19.341
So, tell me Mr. Blackwood,

46:19.877 --> 46:22.444
you want to be a
citizen of this country,

46:22.446 --> 46:25.747
yet you do not support
our esteemed leader?

46:26.016 --> 46:29.751
I will do whatever
you want me to do

46:30.054 --> 46:33.555
so long as it avoids bloodshed.

46:34.825 --> 46:38.026
You weren't so interested
in avoiding bloodshed

46:38.028 --> 46:39.728
at the theater.

46:40.231 --> 46:43.332
I saw what you did
to my colleague.

46:43.334 --> 46:48.070
Every man has a right
to defend himself.

46:51.742 --> 46:54.109
Let me tell you something,

46:57.181 --> 46:59.815
you musty old fuck!

47:03.420 --> 47:08.257
If you didn't have something
of value to the Czar,

47:08.526 --> 47:11.660
I would kill you right here!

47:13.998 --> 47:15.797
Maybe one day

47:16.901 --> 47:19.601
you might get your chance.

47:25.075 --> 47:26.542
Where is the book?

47:32.750 --> 47:35.817
Now, sit there and shut up.

47:38.088 --> 47:39.354
- Romanov.
- Yes, sir?

47:39.356 --> 47:41.023
Go to the cockpit.

47:41.025 --> 47:44.092
- Tell the pilot we're ready.
- Yes, sir.

47:50.834 --> 47:52.601
Hey, wake up!

47:52.603 --> 47:53.835
What?

47:53.904 --> 47:55.003
You drunken fuck!

47:55.005 --> 47:56.972
Can you even fly
this plane today?

47:56.974 --> 47:59.775
Of course, of course.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.877
What are you doing?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.211
Sobering you up.

48:03.213 --> 48:04.046
I hope it worked,

48:04.048 --> 48:05.380
because if there's any
problems with this flight,

48:05.382 --> 48:07.783
I'm going to throw you into
one of these turbine engines.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.051
You got that?

48:09.053 --> 48:11.019
All right, all right.

48:11.021 --> 48:12.688
Not so loud.

48:13.390 --> 48:14.056
I got headache.

48:14.058 --> 48:16.058
Yeah, you'll have more
than a fucking headache

48:16.060 --> 48:18.026
if you don't get us to Moscow!

48:18.028 --> 48:19.428
Now let's go!

48:36.480 --> 48:37.713
Hey.

48:39.049 --> 48:40.816
Where the hell is the food?

48:40.818 --> 48:42.050
We're starving back there!

48:42.052 --> 48:45.687
- 10 minutes.
- You said that an hour ago!

48:46.357 --> 48:47.823
Cooker's slow.

48:47.825 --> 48:50.325
I think it's you who's too slow.

48:50.494 --> 48:52.294
I'm going to take a shit now.

48:52.296 --> 48:55.163
When I'm back, that
shit better be ready.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.498
Understand?

48:57.635 --> 48:59.201
Yeah, yeah.

49:08.445 --> 49:11.647
Don't mess with chef, my friend.

49:47.918 --> 49:52.120
I was told this book can
provide the gift of immortality.

49:55.059 --> 49:57.192
It looks like voodoo
rubbish to me.

49:57.194 --> 50:01.463
How do I know this is going
to benefit the Czar for sure?

50:01.799 --> 50:04.633
I suppose that is
a risk you take.

50:05.569 --> 50:08.837
I'm not a man who
likes to take risks.

50:09.039 --> 50:10.672
We should test it.

50:10.841 --> 50:13.608
And how do you
propose we do that?

50:14.812 --> 50:16.044
Romanov?

50:16.980 --> 50:18.313
Yes, sir?

50:38.902 --> 50:40.335
All right.

50:40.337 --> 50:43.205
If this book is so powerful,

50:43.207 --> 50:44.406
show me.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.578
Fine.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.646
I will show you.

50:55.419 --> 50:57.252
What are you doing?

50:57.254 --> 50:58.153
The reader of this spell

50:58.155 --> 51:02.190
needs to physically
connect with the recipient.

51:02.626 --> 51:05.193
Do you want this, or not?

51:12.536 --> 51:13.802
Okay.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.704
But no tricks,

51:15.939 --> 51:19.241
or you won't be coming
back from the dead.

51:48.739 --> 51:50.172
What now?

51:52.576 --> 51:54.009
Now?

51:54.912 --> 51:56.745
We wait.

52:19.236 --> 52:21.136
What the fuck?

52:22.840 --> 52:24.072
So,

52:24.842 --> 52:26.908
I guess it works.

52:58.508 --> 53:00.375
What the fuck?

53:16.894 --> 53:18.226
Babushka.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.640
You shot me.

53:31.742 --> 53:34.309
I did it to test the
power of the book.

53:34.311 --> 53:35.911
You expect me to
present this to Stalin

53:35.913 --> 53:38.713
without evidence
it actually works?

53:39.249 --> 53:41.182
What if it didn't work?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.785
But it did.

53:45.923 --> 53:48.456
So, you gambled with my life?

53:50.394 --> 53:53.194
I gave you a direct order.

53:54.464 --> 53:57.499
Go and check the
rest of the plane.

53:58.135 --> 54:00.135
In a situation like this,

54:00.137 --> 54:03.905
I wipe my ass with
your feelings!

54:04.741 --> 54:05.941
Now,

54:05.943 --> 54:07.575
obey the order,

54:08.512 --> 54:12.981
before I do some damage
you won't come back from.

54:33.904 --> 54:35.804
Jesus!

55:03.066 --> 55:05.266
Your man up there,

55:05.335 --> 55:09.671
he's been gone for an
awful long time, now.

55:15.679 --> 55:18.413
You know Mr. Blackwood,

55:18.482 --> 55:21.149
you seem to know
something I don't.

55:21.785 --> 55:23.184
I know nothing.

55:24.988 --> 55:29.457
Information I received
said you used this book

55:29.459 --> 55:33.294
to animate several
dolls you created.

55:33.897 --> 55:35.797
Any truth in that?

55:36.033 --> 55:39.034
You shouldn't listen to rumors.

55:39.136 --> 55:42.203
They can be very misleading.

55:43.540 --> 55:46.641
But not in this case,

55:46.643 --> 55:47.876
no?

55:51.882 --> 55:53.348
Your dolls.

55:53.483 --> 55:57.285
They are on board
this plane, yes?

56:11.568 --> 56:14.402
Very good, Mr. Blackwood.

56:14.938 --> 56:19.240
It seems like the dolls have
gotten the better of my men.

56:19.976 --> 56:21.209
Huh?

56:21.378 --> 56:24.145
So, what happens now?

56:24.147 --> 56:25.814
They kill me?

56:26.450 --> 56:29.651
That is entirely up to you.

56:30.754 --> 56:33.955
I could kill you right now.

56:35.759 --> 56:38.827
But you've had this
book for some time,

56:38.962 --> 56:42.764
and I suspect you have used
it to gain immortality.

56:43.967 --> 56:45.366
Am I correct?

56:45.368 --> 56:48.603
You could say that
is a safe assumption.

56:49.873 --> 56:52.240
You are still flesh and bone.

56:53.343 --> 56:55.743
You may be able to live forever,

56:56.313 --> 56:58.613
but if I mess up your face,

56:58.615 --> 57:03.852
and cut off your hands and
limbs, would you really want to?

57:04.888 --> 57:07.655
You'd have to be
very, very quick.

57:07.657 --> 57:09.624
My children, they would kill you

57:09.626 --> 57:12.260
before you made the first cut.

57:13.230 --> 57:14.262
So, what next?

57:14.264 --> 57:17.732
Must I accept the
predictable conclusion?

57:17.734 --> 57:19.200
Hmm?

57:20.437 --> 57:23.037
Or is there a twist

57:23.039 --> 57:24.639
in the tale?

57:33.783 --> 57:36.251
How about this for a twist?

57:36.253 --> 57:39.654
I never intended to take you
to the Czar in the first place.

57:39.656 --> 57:43.892
I always intended to use
this book for my own benefit.

57:44.027 --> 57:46.127
I one day plan to
lead this country.

57:46.129 --> 57:50.532
So, immortality is
rather appealing.

57:51.568 --> 57:53.334
Let's make a deal.

57:54.171 --> 57:55.603
I'm listening.

57:56.773 --> 57:58.506
Upon our arrival in Moscow,

57:58.508 --> 58:02.143
I will personally
authorize a payment to you

58:02.546 --> 58:04.712
of 62 million rubles.

58:06.183 --> 58:07.682
Untraceable.

58:07.684 --> 58:09.083
And, um,

58:09.219 --> 58:13.021
what is it you'd
expect in return?

58:13.290 --> 58:14.856
The book for one.

58:14.991 --> 58:17.158
And for the duration
of this flight,

58:17.160 --> 58:19.761
guidance and advice on its use.

58:20.697 --> 58:26.301
Then, when you have received
your money in Moscow,

58:26.303 --> 58:28.169
you leave the country.

58:29.306 --> 58:32.473
What if we just
kill you instead?

58:33.109 --> 58:34.776
Then what will you be left with?

58:34.778 --> 58:36.611
With the money I'm offering you,

58:36.613 --> 58:40.548
you could start a new life
anywhere in the world.

58:42.452 --> 58:43.818
Kill me now,

58:43.820 --> 58:47.488
and you're left with a
very uncertain future.

58:56.166 --> 58:59.534
I don't want money.

59:00.470 --> 59:02.270
I want freedom.

59:03.773 --> 59:05.306
You see, Major,

59:05.308 --> 59:10.545
I have been running for a
very, very long time now.

59:11.147 --> 59:14.582
I'm not going to run anymore.

59:34.504 --> 59:36.938
Romanov, take them!

59:37.274 --> 59:38.072
Come my lovelies.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.240
I need to find the spell

59:39.242 --> 59:43.411
for the reversal of
the resurrection!

59:43.480 --> 59:45.213
What the fuck are you doing?

59:45.215 --> 59:48.783
You gambled with my
life, now I end yours.

59:53.256 --> 59:54.489
Here it is!

59:54.491 --> 59:55.323
Come on, you old fuck!

59:55.325 --> 59:56.824
Let's see how you
and those dollies do

59:56.826 --> 59:59.727
against a man who
can't be killed!

01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:19.447
We've done it!

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.251
We've done it together
my lovelies.

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:26.788
And what did we
learn today together?

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:32.393
Together, we can
overcome our evils

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.228
by being

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:35.496
good.

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.665
Yes.

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:42.603
Now, let's go with haste
and speed, let's go!

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.619
Fuck me, this shit is good.

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.858
Re-route this plane.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.927
Whose orders are these?

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:06.961
Mine.

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.732
This plane is now
under new management.

01:01:11.101 --> 01:01:13.968
We're no longer going to Moscow.

01:01:14.904 --> 01:01:16.471
Where are we going?

01:01:16.473 --> 01:01:17.772
Britain.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:21.142
A Soviet plane can't
enter their airspace!

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:23.211
They will shoot us down!

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:25.713
That is for me to worry about.

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:28.483
Now, re-route this plane.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:31.886
And what if I do not?

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:36.357
Then you can say hello
to my little friend.

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:41.829
You kill me and there'll
be nobody to fly the plane!

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:43.631
You'll crash and die!

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:46.134
You just let me
worry about that.

01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:49.237
We can concentrate
on you for a second.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:51.739
Now listen to me carefully.

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:53.975
If you re-route this plane,

01:01:53.977 --> 01:01:56.911
there is much chance
you will survive,

01:01:56.913 --> 01:02:01.649
but if not, there is
greater chance you will die.

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.818
Now,

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.087
What is it going to be?

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:07.388
If I take the chance,

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:10.358
what is in it for
me if I do survive?

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.727
You know,

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:16.431
in all my years, there's
something I've noticed

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:17.665
in common with the people,

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:22.403
no matter what age,
race, or nationality.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.673
What is that?

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:29.410
Greed.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.550
This flight could
cost me my life!

01:02:35.552 --> 01:02:36.884
It could,

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.454
but if you survive,

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:43.391
that could be the
greatest gift ever.

01:02:43.693 --> 01:02:46.527
Now, what is it going to be?

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:57.738
Kalashnikov,

01:02:58.341 --> 01:03:01.442
keep the eyes on
this naughty boy.

01:04:12.148 --> 01:04:14.148
Target acquired.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.469
<i>Scheisse!</i>

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:00.962
Say bye-bye.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.248
What have we got?

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.083
It's strange.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:32.186
Pretty much everything on
that flight was destroyed,

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:33.754
but look at these.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:36.891
That book and these dolls.

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:40.828
Completely untouched,
no damage whatsoever.

01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:43.097
Unusual, but not impossible.

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:45.866
Perhaps they were securely
packed in the cargo area.

01:06:45.868 --> 01:06:49.637
No, everything in that section
was completely destroyed,

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.871
but look at these.

01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:52.873
Not even a scratch.

01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:54.442
Have you looked
through that book?

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:56.577
- Yeah.
- What's in it?

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.546
Very bloody witchy to be honest,

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:01.182
lots of spells, lots of symbols.

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:04.618
- Where are the bodies?
- In the morgue downstairs.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.886
That's the other thing
I wanted to mention.

01:07:05.888 --> 01:07:09.190
We've got a similar
situation down there.

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.524
What do you mean?

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:11.692
Five bodies recovered.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:14.929
Most of them are mangled,
some completely torn apart.

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:17.932
But there's one body
down there, some old man.

01:07:17.934 --> 01:07:19.433
Barely a bruise.

01:07:19.435 --> 01:07:20.468
He's dead, yes?

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:21.535
Well yes, of course
he is, Peters.

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:22.503
He's in the morgue, old chap.

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:24.438
I understand that, it's just
the way you were talking,

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.407
it sounded like you
were going to say he

01:07:26.409 --> 01:07:28.008
miraculously survived.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:29.777
No, he's very much dead.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.213
But, in a crash
of that severity,

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.281
where the plane has
suffered both fire damage

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:38.452
and water submersion,
it's intriguing.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.655
So, what do you think it means?

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.524
I don't know.

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:45.526
I'd like to read that
book for starters,

01:07:45.528 --> 01:07:50.264
and find out exactly what
these people are all about.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:51.999
All right.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:52.900
Well make a start on that.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.770
I'll go down to the morgue,
check out that body.

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.037
Okay.

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:34.841
Creepy voodoo shit.

01:09:36.939 --> 01:09:37.504
It's true.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:40.441
There are no
abrasions on the body.

01:09:40.743 --> 01:09:41.341
Surprising.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:44.411
He was hardly a young man;
looks rather weak and fragile.

01:09:44.412 --> 01:09:46.881
Indeed, he is of advanced years.

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.250
But that's not
what interests me.

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:50.917
You see, earlier this evening,

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.089
I made an incision in
the chest of the corpse.

01:09:55.725 --> 01:09:56.991
Yeah?

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.066
Where did you make the incision?

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:09.536
Right here, around
the subclavicle muscle.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:10.871
There's
nothing there now.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:12.840
Precisely.

01:10:14.076 --> 01:10:18.012
Are you saying this
body has some kind of,

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.380
I don't know,

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.548
self-healing ability?

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:22.950
It appears so.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.387
I mean, I've never
seen anything like it.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:28.455
His vital signs indicate death.

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:32.826
Yet his body is still seems
capable of healing from a wound.

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:36.463
If his body can heal, why does
he still look so decrepit?

01:10:36.465 --> 01:10:37.898
I've no idea.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.867
The body can heal
from the wound,

01:10:39.869 --> 01:10:44.138
but it can't reverse
the aging process.

01:10:44.507 --> 01:10:45.839
Fascinating.

01:10:46.776 --> 01:10:47.341
I agree.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:50.311
I've sent blood samples
from the cadaver

01:10:50.313 --> 01:10:51.779
and sent them to the lab.

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:54.682
- Should be interesting.
- Okay.

01:10:54.684 --> 01:10:57.685
- Let me know when they arrive.
- I will.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:57.444
Why do you consider this
such an urgency, sir?

01:11:57.446 --> 01:12:00.814
We've been looking for
Amos Blackwood for 10 years

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.450
in connection with a
remarkable piece of literature

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:06.286
which is of great importance
to our government.

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:10.491
In 1941, we sent a German
double agent to intercept him

01:12:10.493 --> 01:12:12.359
on a train heading
for Nuremberg.

01:12:12.361 --> 01:12:15.229
Unfortunately, the
agent was killed.

01:12:15.231 --> 01:12:18.499
Sounds like Blackwood ended
up in the Soviet Union.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:21.335
Not that it matters now
considering he's dead,

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:23.404
but it's imperative
we retrieve that book

01:12:23.406 --> 01:12:27.141
before someone else discovers
the true value of it.

01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:02.803
Have you missed Papa as
much as he's missed you?

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.841
Come, let's get out
of here quickly.

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:12.112
Oh, Papa feels good.

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:30.230
Um, sir, what the hell
happened in there?

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:32.232
Amos Blackwood is still alive.

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:35.002
But the agents
claimed he was dead.

01:14:35.004 --> 01:14:35.969
They were wrong.

01:14:35.971 --> 01:14:37.771
Bloody incompetent!

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.006
So, what now, sir?

01:14:39.008 --> 01:14:41.775
We must inform all the
intelligence agencies

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:44.711
that we have a
fugitive on the move.

01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:49.750
But sir, you said you sought
to protect him back in '41.

01:14:49.752 --> 01:14:51.118
That's right.

01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:53.720
Then why make him our enemy?

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:56.823
Because he's strong
enough to take it.

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.793
He's not the hero anymore,

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:03.530
but he could be again one day.

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:05.899
A hero is someone
who understands

01:15:05.901 --> 01:15:09.369
the responsibility that
comes with his freedom.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.205
But of course, freedom

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:14.975
can only benefit those
who know how to use it.

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:20.013
So...

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.717
Your move,

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.352
Mr. Blackwood.
