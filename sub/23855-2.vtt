[water dripping]

00:44.002 --> 00:45.003
[softly] Hey.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.797
You're still wet, babe. [chuckles]

00:49.632 --> 00:50.717
I gotta go.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.345
What are you doing, huh?

00:55.472 --> 00:56.890
What do you think I'm doing?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.060
Come on. What about the baby?

01:01.019 --> 01:02.187
The baby's asleep.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.316
But Mama's wide awake.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.284
Looks like Daddy's waking up too.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.877
Come on, just a quickie.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.005
The doctor says it's good for labor.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.304
[Marie grunts]

01:41.434 --> 01:42.435
Oh!

01:43.186 --> 01:45.522
Petey, Petey don't rip them!

01:45.605 --> 01:46.940
They're like new from Victoria's.

01:48.817 --> 01:51.444

[prisoner 1] Yo, mama!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.609
[indistinct shouts from prisoner]

03:15.403 --> 03:16.779
[prisoner 2] Fucking bitch!

03:17.113 --> 03:18.198
[wolf whistle]

03:20.325 --> 03:21.910
[prisoner 3] Come on over here, baby.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.245
Mr. Dorsey...

03:25.872 --> 03:28.124
I'm KJ Harper
from the prosecutor's office.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.585
You said you were asleep in your car
under the Pulaski Bridge

03:30.668 --> 03:32.629
-when you were arrested last night.
-Fuck you!

03:36.341 --> 03:38.343
This will help with the shakes, okay?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.974
The Pulaski's far from the park.

03:45.266 --> 03:47.185
Are you sure
that's where you were sleeping?

03:47.727 --> 03:49.103
Yeah, I'm sure.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.439
Can anyone confirm you were there?

03:59.864 --> 04:02.575
There was a pint in your car, of whiskey,

04:02.742 --> 04:04.452
and you hadn't touched it.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.913
So you'd just bought it, right?

04:07.288 --> 04:09.457
What time did you buy the booze?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.209
I don't remember!

04:11.292 --> 04:13.169
Mac, look at me.

04:14.170 --> 04:17.674
Where do you usually buy your liquor?
Is there a place you like to go?

04:18.174 --> 04:21.010
Charlie, the guy at the store,

04:21.261 --> 04:23.388
A-1 Westside Ave,

04:23.930 --> 04:26.057
lets me clean up in his toilet.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.934
[coughing]

04:28.393 --> 04:30.103
Thank you, Mr. Dorsey.

04:30.895 --> 04:31.813
Officer.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.525
[prisoner]
Hey, come on man where you going?

04:36.109 --> 04:39.153
-[ventilator machine pumping]
-[monitor beeping steadily]

04:55.044 --> 04:56.045
Nurse.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.425
Nurse. Nurse!

05:01.509 --> 05:02.510
Nurse!

05:07.056 --> 05:07.932
[Isaiah] Where is he?

05:08.099 --> 05:12.145
They've taken him downstairs
for more tests, but I saw him blink.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.522
-What?
-I saw him blink his eyes.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.066
-What does that mean?
-The doctors, they did a scan.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.693
And she said there were lines on it.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.570
Brain activity.

05:22.530 --> 05:25.533
It means that he can come back to us.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.246
All right, he's going to need a lot
of mental stimulation, talking, music.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.247
Mm.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.041
[Seth] I've seen people
with worse injuries.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.793
Brain injuries recover from this
over there.

05:35.918 --> 05:36.794
-More than--
-Yeah.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.796
We'll call the whole family
to come and visit.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.633
We'll play his favorite music.
And Seth, you'll put your uniform back on.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.261
He wanted to see you in it so bad.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.431
-Um, anything for Little Man.
-[Latrice] Yeah. Yeah.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.059
All night. All night I kept saying,

05:51.142 --> 05:54.437
"Please, please come back to me.
Come back to your mama."

05:54.979 --> 05:55.813
He heard me.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.523
He heard me.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.613
God is good.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.157
All the time.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.620
-All the time.
-God is good. God is good.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.871
God is good.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.915
God is good.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.084
Think that's funny? Want one of these?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.336
-No, I don't eat that cake donut shit.
-No?

06:18.419 --> 06:20.838
It's like Play-Doh.
You'll shit it out a year later.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.173
You got experience with that?

06:22.256 --> 06:24.592
[cop 1] Hey, at least my mommy
doesn't pack my breakfast.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.428
-What is that dog shit anyway?
-[cop 2] It's a<i> pastel,</i> dumb-ass.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.223
[cop 1] Oh!<i> Coño, perdóname. Pastel.</i>

06:30.306 --> 06:32.183
-[cop 2] Shit's homemade, bitch.
-[cop 1 laughs]

06:32.266 --> 06:33.351
You better look out!

06:33.726 --> 06:36.104
Finish your Puerto Rican muffin
and get out of here.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.688
Manny, you're with Osorio.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.316
You call me on my cell later.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.068
Jablonski, you're with me.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.695
[Manny] The new guy? Seriously?

06:46.948 --> 06:50.118
You breaking up the team, Di?
You and me, Starsky and Hutch, baby.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.328
Go on, man. Get out of here. Do your job.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.211
[chatter on police radio]

07:04.882 --> 07:06.050
How you holding up?

07:08.886 --> 07:09.762
I'm good.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.806
You're what?

07:12.682 --> 07:13.599
I'm good.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.896
[chuckles]

07:19.981 --> 07:22.108
Leave him alone,<i> mamita</i>, he's married.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.735
I don't mind married.
I don't kiss and tell.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.737
[DiAngelo laughs]

07:26.821 --> 07:27.738
Let's go. Come on.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.576
[woman] You new here,<i> papi?</i> You cute.

07:34.370 --> 07:38.666
You work narcotics in the South District,
girls like that are just part of the uh...

07:39.584 --> 07:40.877
the benefits package.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.215
Well, I never even took a free cup
of coffee working in the East.

07:47.633 --> 07:48.509
I guess...

07:49.427 --> 07:52.013
whatever they taught me at the Academy
just stuck.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.807
Well, they also teach you
to climb a fucking rope.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.770
You've been out how many years? How
many fucking ropes you climbed, huh?

08:03.441 --> 08:06.694
Fucking idealist with a badge. [chuckles]

08:11.115 --> 08:13.910
You remind me of me back in the day.
Open your window.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.247
Open it.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.921
-You're freezing, right?
-Yeah.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.424
Good, that's going to wake you up,
because this shit ain't patrol.

08:29.759 --> 08:33.221
There's no parking behind the 7-Eleven,
jerking off till your shift's over.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.472
We're like athletes.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.100
-[honks horn]
-[responding honks]

08:38.226 --> 08:40.603
Can't think about what they're doing,
they just gotta do.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.647
You think too much, you fuck it up.

08:43.606 --> 08:45.107
Now for players, that's...

08:46.275 --> 08:48.319
that's just a lost game. But for us?

08:49.028 --> 08:52.823
That's me showing up to Osorio's house,
telling his mama her son's dead.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.744
Who's the guy?

08:58.162 --> 08:59.580
The one they put away for it.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.249
He's a bum.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.752
Would've killed somebody someday.
Good riddance.

09:09.882 --> 09:14.053
-[indistinct chatter]
-In case you hadn't noticed, bro...

09:15.471 --> 09:16.764
this ain't the East.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.604
[officer] Yeah? Huh? Huh?
Don't give me any shit.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.690
[chatter continues indistinctly]

09:27.066 --> 09:29.443
[rap music playing nearby]

09:32.363 --> 09:34.907
Let me ask you something.
Where did Di find him?

09:36.033 --> 09:37.702
-Jablonski.
-[Osorio] East District.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.537
Was teaching one of those
undercover classes

09:39.620 --> 09:41.205
he does at different precincts.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.376
Went over to Jablonski's house
a few times, whatever.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.421
You know how he gets about the new guy.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.466
Jablonski's from the East District?
[scoffs]

09:52.967 --> 09:57.096
All them cops do is fucking arrest yuppies
for drunk and disorderlies.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.224
Fucking rookie.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.103
What if he cracks?

10:04.645 --> 10:07.231
DiAngelo vouches for him, so that's that.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.442
He says Pete's good people.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.945
Yeah, okay. He goes to Jablonski's
a few times, he has a few beers,

10:13.029 --> 10:15.281
his wife cooks him a few dinners,
so he's good people.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.617
Fuck that, fuck good, fuck him.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.167
-[door opens]
-[KJ sighs]

10:28.336 --> 10:31.213
Fish... it's KJ.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.051
Uh, KJ Harper
from the prosecutor's office again.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.179
Um, when you get this, call me.

10:38.679 --> 10:42.558
It's about the guy you arrested, Dorsey.
Call me.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.854
[bottles clinking]

10:59.700 --> 11:00.951
[doorbell ringing]

11:04.664 --> 11:06.332
Hi... uh...

11:07.667 --> 11:08.501
Is James home?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.755
I need to talk to him about a case.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.887
You can wait here.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.813
-What the hell is she doing here?
-Honey, calm down.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.189
You need to handle this.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.608
-It's not happening again.
-I'll take care of it. Calm down.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.611
Have you lost your mind?

11:35.903 --> 11:39.031
Okay. Look, Dorsey didn't do it, okay?

11:39.156 --> 11:41.659
He was at a liquor store across town,

11:41.784 --> 11:44.078
three miles from the park
when the accident happened.

11:44.161 --> 11:46.247
-Who the hell is Dorsey?
-The hit-and-run in the park.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.291
I tried to tell you,
but you weren't answering your phone.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.380
[sighs] Look, the victim's a kid,
from a good family.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.426
And you're at the start of a campaign...
We can't ignore this.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.637
Are the papers picking it up?

12:02.888 --> 12:03.889
No.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.809
But his family are churchgoers

12:06.934 --> 12:09.854
who most likely vote,
and every vote counts.

12:10.438 --> 12:11.480
You know I'm right.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.025
Don't let your caseload slip, KJ.

12:21.365 --> 12:23.617
Thanks... James.

12:25.077 --> 12:26.078
KJ.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.956
Don't ever come to my home.

12:35.838 --> 12:38.758
[man] Uh, it's wonderful
how well your son is doing.

12:39.550 --> 12:42.428
I see you have a deductible plan
with your wife's insurance.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.764
Yeah, yeah. How much
is it going to cost me?

12:44.972 --> 12:48.225
We're looking $350 per day in the ICU.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.311
With Dr. Sangupta's recommendation,

12:50.436 --> 12:53.355
he'll be here from 30 to 45 days.

12:54.064 --> 12:58.486
I've also included surgery costs,
rehabilitation, lab tests.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.746
We just bought a house.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.541
If there is financial hardship,
we have programs to help--

13:12.625 --> 13:14.001
I got a job, man.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.005
-We'll figure it out.
-I understand.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.218
But we will need to discuss
a payment plan.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.345
Wh-- What amount can you start with?

13:25.888 --> 13:26.764
Today.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.477
[woman] Hey, the kids
ain't stopped talking about last year

13:31.560 --> 13:32.895
when you took them for ice cream.

13:32.978 --> 13:36.524
So, you got to hurry up, get better,
so you can take them again.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.192
[Isaiah] Latrice.

13:41.862 --> 13:43.364
I got to go to work.

13:44.031 --> 13:47.868
So, I want you to stay here
with Brenton and...

13:48.702 --> 13:50.871
just call the school,
let them know you need time off.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.207
[woman] I'll-- I'll call them.

13:55.501 --> 13:56.877
Thanks, Marcelle.

13:59.547 --> 14:02.841
Isaiah, come over here
and talk to Brenton.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.510
Before you go.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.846
It's good for him to hear your voice.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.931
[ventilator machine pumping]

14:09.557 --> 14:11.600
Come on. Tell him you love him.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.103
Tell him.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.492
He already knows.

14:53.809 --> 14:54.727
[door closes]

15:10.159 --> 15:12.578
[sheep bleating]

15:14.747 --> 15:17.541
[chickens clucking]

16:07.716 --> 16:09.593
[dogs barking]

16:09.677 --> 16:10.594
[Fish] Shut up!

16:11.345 --> 16:12.972
[Fish] Shut up! [grunts]

16:13.347 --> 16:15.683
Where were you?
I left you, like, three messages.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.811
Seven. Exactly seven. Now don't make me
put you in the hole, huh?

16:19.186 --> 16:21.897
All right, come on. No.
You better duck in before they get out.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.441
And don't stare at them.
Dogs don't like you staring at them.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.653
This is Jack and Jill, they're the twins.
They're going blind.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.447
Uh, this is Ginger over here, right?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.992
She I got in Atlantic City.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.453
This is Lady here. She's almost 15.
That's why she's got to wear that diaper.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.956
-Why didn't you call?
-I turn my phone off while I'm sleeping.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.708
Don't wanna mess
with my circadian rhythms.

16:40.791 --> 16:44.420
You should do the same. It'd probably
be good for your OCD, or your DTs.

16:44.503 --> 16:45.879
[dogs panting]

16:45.963 --> 16:47.840
We need to send the victim's clothes
to the lab

16:47.923 --> 16:50.134
to test for paint transfer
from the vehicle.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.553
And I want to talk to that narc's CI.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.930
Maybe he mistook Dorsey
for someone else.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.142
Okay, well, first of all,
this isn't the crime of the century.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.560
The kid was probably a banger.

16:59.643 --> 17:02.896
And second,
I'm not the "almost dead police," okay?

17:02.980 --> 17:04.773
Kid ain't dead. Call me when he is.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.068
Well, prosecutors outrank detectives...

17:09.153 --> 17:10.779
so get dressed, let's go.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.699
Oh. Oh, really? You went there, huh?

17:14.074 --> 17:15.993
Well, the kids haven't eaten yet,

17:16.076 --> 17:20.497
and Jackson, he's missing his epiglottis,
so I got to put him in his high chair,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.291
and feed him with the funnel,
then we can go.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.294
-Okay, I will meet you at the district.
-Okay, that sounds great.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.963
-[dog barks]
-Come here. Come on. Come here.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.300
What's a matter? You guys don't like her?

17:31.592 --> 17:32.551
I don't blame you.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.221
[Manny in Latino accent]
Hey, I don't know nothing, man.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.474
I swear to God,
you fuck around too much, man,

17:38.557 --> 17:41.018
-you play too many games, man.
-[laughter]

17:41.351 --> 17:42.478
DiAngelo, right?

17:42.770 --> 17:45.773
-Fish Rinaldi. That's right.
-Yeah. From last night. How you doing?

17:45.856 --> 17:48.275
-Good. How you doing? Mm-mm.
-You meet my team yet?

17:48.358 --> 17:49.943
-Manny Wilcox.
-Hey.

17:51.028 --> 17:52.029
-Felix Osorio.
-Hey.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.949
-And the rest, who gives a fuck?
-[men chuckling]

17:56.325 --> 17:59.912
Listen, I hate to hassle you,
but about that job last night--

18:00.037 --> 18:02.081
-We need to talk to your CI.
-Yeah.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.041
The one who ID'd Mac Dorsey.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.460
[Manny clears throat]

18:08.378 --> 18:10.881
-I'll check you later, Di.
-All right, Donny. You stay safe.

18:10.964 --> 18:11.799
Okay, man.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.930
You know, they call it
a "Confidential Informant"

18:18.013 --> 18:19.473
for a reason, Marcia Clark.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.100
I tried to tell her that. [chuckles]

18:22.684 --> 18:26.271
I can't make the charges stick to Dorsey
if I don't talk to your CI.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.608
You can't make the charges stick
if you don't show up for court.

18:31.568 --> 18:33.779
We believe Dorsey was across town
when the kid got hit.

18:33.862 --> 18:37.324
Yeah, says a guy whose brain's been
soaking in Jim Beam for 50 years?

18:37.407 --> 18:40.744
Not him, the store owner
who sold him the Jim Beam.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.164
Is that right?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.334
That's my bad, then.

18:48.418 --> 18:50.587
Guess I jammed you up
with some faulty intel.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.424
CI's lie out their assholes.
Anything for a bump or a blowjob.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.260
It happens, right? What are you gonna do?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.930
I would still like to talk to him.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.600
Well, I'll see what I can do, KJ.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.479
You want to leave me your personal cell?

19:09.064 --> 19:11.817
You can reach me at the office.
You know the number.

19:13.777 --> 19:14.945
We need to go to the hospital.

19:15.028 --> 19:18.365
I got to get the kid's clothes to the lab
and the accident unit down to the park--

19:18.448 --> 19:20.242
-Fine. Do that.
-[scoffs]

19:24.413 --> 19:25.414
You fuck her yet?

19:25.497 --> 19:26.748
-Huh?
-[chuckles]

19:26.957 --> 19:28.000
Everyone here has.

19:29.585 --> 19:32.379
So, what's up with the kid?
Is he still up at the ICU?

19:32.462 --> 19:34.965
Stapled head, and she's on a mission
for a fucking carrot.

19:35.549 --> 19:38.218
Listen, I got to jet, brother.
It was good to see you.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.429
Keep me in the loop.
I might have some tips for you.

19:40.971 --> 19:43.849
-And I'll get back at you about my CI.
-Appreciate that.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.058
[DiAngelo] All right.

19:49.313 --> 19:50.397
Wilcox, you're with me.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.526
What the fuck? You said Dorsey was solid.

19:54.610 --> 19:57.154
Keep your fucking voice down, man.

19:57.654 --> 20:01.575
We're way out on the limb here, Di,
for a new guy nobody knows.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.743
I know him.

20:03.368 --> 20:06.580
-I trust him. I'm taking care of this.
-You said the same thing about Dorsey.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.836
You want to repeat that,
because I didn't hear you right the first.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.884
Go do your fucking job.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.811
So, I got the back room at Mancini's.
There's gonna be like 30 of us.

20:29.895 --> 20:33.440
It's me and Jake, Nona, Pops,
and that nightmare cunt he calls a wife.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.359
Wow, babe.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.694
Nice!

20:37.986 --> 20:39.613
I thought you were gonna paint.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.616
The wallpaper's better for the baby.
There's no fumes.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.619
Paint's more permanent, you're not
gonna have to redo it every year.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.412
What you got there's kind of cheap.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.872
Bed Bath & Beyond?

20:49.998 --> 20:50.958
I don't think so.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.253
I saw that same design
at Walmart last week. I don't know.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.922
[Marie] We were just talking
about the christening brunch.

20:57.506 --> 20:58.966
Everyone's coming.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.760
What about you, Pete?
Anyone coming from your side?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.721
I mean, you can't be adding last minute,
so if no one's coming--

21:04.805 --> 21:06.556
I fucking heard you the first time.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.309
I left my phone in the living room.
Can you go get it?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.896
I just remembered a few names
I want to add to the list. Go.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.860
Your cousin is a fucking bitch.
No wonder her boyfriend kicked her out.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.363
You're always letting her get to you.
Always.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.117
The room looks great, babe.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.328
You're a good daddy.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.622
And Little Poke likes it.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.044
Come on.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.429
You ever think maybe you ought
to invite him?

21:47.055 --> 21:48.974
-No.
-He called again.

21:51.643 --> 21:52.853
He wants to see you.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.105
I told him about the baby.

21:55.188 --> 21:56.315
You did what?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.901
He keeps calling,
what was I supposed to do?

22:00.569 --> 22:03.405
-You don't pick up the phone, that's what.
-Okay.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.658
God.

22:16.084 --> 22:17.336
-No way.
-He wouldn't even quit.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.171
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

22:20.922 --> 22:21.840
Hi, uh...

22:22.341 --> 22:25.218
Mrs. Butler,
this is our evidence technician.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.181
We'll need to process Brenton

22:29.264 --> 22:31.725
for any evidence that may have transferred
during the accident.

22:32.142 --> 22:33.769
Why do you need to do that now?

22:34.227 --> 22:37.064
Sometimes debris from the vehicle
gets on the victim.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.608
It could help with the investigation.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.986
'"Help with the investigation"?
You said you got the man who did this.

22:44.362 --> 22:45.530
It's a formality.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.826
I'll need your consent for the collection.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.538
[ventilator machine pumping]

22:54.539 --> 22:56.583
We won't hurt him, I promise.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.189
Thank you.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.611
-Start with his right foot.
-Okay.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.244
Okay.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.042
You don't have to be afraid. He's strong.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.964
He's getting stronger every day,
the doctor said so.

24:39.227 --> 24:40.061
I got something.

24:50.780 --> 24:51.698
Right there.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.161
-Got it. Yeah.
-Okay.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.524
-[Brenton gasps]
-I'm sorry.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.194
He's been doing that
for the past few days.

25:29.319 --> 25:31.738
It's a reaction to being touched.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.574
He knows you're touching him.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.455
[line ringing]

25:40.538 --> 25:41.790
<i>Yeah. Detective Rinaldi.</i>

25:41.915 --> 25:44.042
Fish, I found something.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.211
<i>Good for you. I can't find his shoes.</i>

25:47.337 --> 25:49.130
-What?
-I'm missing his shoes.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.636
Unless he decided to just wear his socks
to go bike riding in the park.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.973
But I don't see his shoes
in the crime scene photos either.

25:59.015 --> 26:02.227
-Did you check evidence?
-No. I just looked under my desk here.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.144
[KJ] <i>Listen,</i>

26:03.520 --> 26:05.689
we found what looks like a paint chip.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.649
A blue paint chip in his hair.

26:08.441 --> 26:09.442
So it's a blue car.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.237
That's good.
No, it is, because you just expanded

26:12.320 --> 26:14.155
our suspect pool by 200,000.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.284
Maybe if he tried to dump the car,
a salvage yard has it.

26:17.534 --> 26:19.911
<i>There's like 200 of those</i>
<i>in the city alone.</i>

26:20.453 --> 26:23.331
So get uni's to canvas them.
And check the DMV, okay?

26:23.415 --> 26:24.666
For a blue car?

26:24.791 --> 26:26.835
The lab will narrow down
what we're looking for.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.962
I'll send them the paint chip now and...

26:29.212 --> 26:32.132
I will check the hospital
for these shoes you can't find.

26:32.215 --> 26:34.801
-What are you going to be doing?
<i>-Looking for a blue car I guess--</i>

26:34.884 --> 26:36.469
He-- Goddamn.

26:37.721 --> 26:41.224
My CI's in the wind,
the one who fingered Dorsey.

26:41.308 --> 26:44.227
Ah... It doesn't matter,
Dorsey didn't do it.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.690
The vehicle that hit the kid,
it was a blue car, not a brown car.

26:50.108 --> 26:50.984
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

26:51.067 --> 26:54.237
And now she wants me to check
every salvage yard from here to Timbuktu.

26:54.529 --> 26:57.365
So, uh... what else you got?

26:58.033 --> 27:01.911
Well, the assholes that found him
in the park pinched his shoes.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.665
That or some piece of shit in the park
took them.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.171
Yeah, Tim's go for a mint in the hood,
right? Every banger's got ten pair.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.213
Mm-hmm.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.759
-To mix and match with their pit bulls.
-[both laughing]

27:16.760 --> 27:17.677
The ghetto elk.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.182
Hey, listen. Listen. Me and the guys,

27:22.265 --> 27:24.726
we usually hit up Mahoney's
most weekend nights, right?

27:25.268 --> 27:26.853
-If you want, drop by.
-All right.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.438
Just don't bring your fucking partner.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.814
-She's not my partner.
-All right.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.901
-Yeah, let's do it soon.
-Okay.

27:33.234 --> 27:34.069
All right.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.659
[seagulls squawking]

[glass crunching underfoot]

29:15.920 --> 29:17.505
[engine stops, car door opens]

29:17.589 --> 29:20.550
[KJ] Way, way over there. I'll look here.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.470
[Fish] If the boots were here,
they're long gone by now.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.264
Goddamn it. Look at this thing.
Look at it.

29:26.431 --> 29:27.307
[KJ] What?

29:27.432 --> 29:29.976
-[Fish] Come over here.
-[KJ] I'm fine where I am.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.854
-What is it?
-[Fish] I got a fucking hole in this.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.356
I swear to God,
it wasn't there five hours ago.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.233
Look, you can see my sock.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.319
The boots aren't here. Let's go.

29:39.819 --> 29:42.489
The hospital never logged them,
so they have to be here.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.240
The dog stole the boots.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.326
Or the Jehovah's Witnesses
that were in ICU.

29:48.536 --> 29:51.414
Don't you have more cases to be working?
Why do you got so much free time?

29:52.916 --> 29:55.877
You must not have kids or a husband.

29:56.836 --> 29:57.712
Or a boyfriend.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.132
-Why did you leave New York?
-[Fish sighs]

30:01.299 --> 30:03.176
I like the view
from this side of the river.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.638
Check it out. She's like,
"Yo, all you foreigners out there

30:06.721 --> 30:09.015
that aren't Muslims, come to our shores.

30:09.390 --> 30:10.892
Jersey City, look at my ass."

30:11.935 --> 30:14.270
That's her ass, right? Not her fupa?

30:14.813 --> 30:15.939
[sighs]

30:18.399 --> 30:20.360
-Where you going? The car's over there.
-Well...

30:21.361 --> 30:24.572
if somebody stole them,
maybe they saw the accident.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.242
Or whoever left the accident.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.702
Or maybe they didn't see diddly shit

30:29.786 --> 30:32.288
because they got to the accident
five hours later.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.334
This is where he got hit?

30:37.627 --> 30:40.922
No, the point of impact was over there.
That's where the car stopped.

30:50.765 --> 30:51.641
What?

30:57.480 --> 30:58.940
That's a lot of windows.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.109
Yeah.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.154

31:12.328 --> 31:15.665
-[glass crunching]
-[door closes upstairs]

32:25.360 --> 32:26.486
You locked me out.

32:33.660 --> 32:37.163
-I asked you to keep my car off.
-It's freezing, I had to run the heat.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.040
-You waste gas like that.
-[scoffs]

32:39.165 --> 32:40.917
I'll get you back, don't worry.

32:41.334 --> 32:43.461
-Did you find anything?
-Nope, <i>nada.</i>

32:44.462 --> 32:45.505
What?

32:47.715 --> 32:49.300
He had a thing for seagulls.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.553
That's sweet. Let's go home.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.639
We need to find those boots.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.559
-Open markets?
-[sighs]
