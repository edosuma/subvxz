WEBVTT

00:08.133 --> 00:10.927
What if you really are
Mr. Right There in Front of Me?

00:11.052 --> 00:12.512
<i>Previously on You Me Her...</i>

00:12.637 --> 00:15.056
Hey.
Can I talk to you privately?

00:15.181 --> 00:16.224
Uhh!

00:16.307 --> 00:19.519
<i></i>
-I'm keeping the baby, Kylie.

00:19.644 --> 00:20.478
<i>Fuck you.</i>

00:20.562 --> 00:22.647
I just want you to know
what I said that night...

00:22.731 --> 00:24.149
"It's not me, it's you?" Yeah. There's nothing wrong with you.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.444
You are perfectly Nina Martone.

00:27.527 --> 00:29.154
I already work insane hours
at Pinnacle,

00:29.237 --> 00:31.698
and if I make partner,
it's gonna be even worse, so...

00:31.781 --> 00:34.367
I was assuming you were coming
home, not coming to get us.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.619
My rate is $40 an hour,

00:36.703 --> 00:38.455
minimum five hours per day,
five days per week.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.498
-We can start looking at daycares.
-Thank you.

00:40.582 --> 00:42.417
-Fuck!

00:42.542 --> 00:44.711
I forgot about my meeting
with Sasha and her grandma.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.088
It is only a matter of time
before those two

00:47.172 --> 00:49.132
gravitate back
to the world that they know.

00:49.257 --> 00:51.634
How long are you gonna live their life
instead of your own? Hey, the Wilbergs are putting
their place on the market.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.639
You wanna check it out?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.225
-I'm looking for my girlfriend.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.810
God, I love that house.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.687
What's not to love?
I'd move there.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.692
Well, fuck.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.290
How long do you think
they can keep this up?

01:22.874 --> 01:25.710
I hate that I still find
this shit show so damn riveting.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.295
I've surrendered to the shame.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.755
I want to walk away,

01:28.838 --> 01:31.174
but my body is just
not listening to my brain.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.803
Well, here they are, the Trakarskys,
back on the block.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.639
-No, I-I wouldn't...
-No, no, no. We're not back on the block.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.015
We were just next door, visiting...

01:39.098 --> 01:41.226
So I didn't just catch you guys
house shopping?

01:41.309 --> 01:42.310
What? No!

01:42.435 --> 01:45.021
You're gonna laugh
'cause this is a real, like, uh...

01:45.104 --> 01:46.940
-Funny story.
-...you know, Hawthorne Heights story.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.983
We were at Helen Wilberg's house.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.319
Turns out she's a virtuoso baker...

01:51.444 --> 01:52.529
-Uh, yeah.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.823
...who is opening her own shop,
and wanted us...

01:54.906 --> 01:57.408
-...to try her... cupcakes.
-We test them.

01:57.534 --> 01:58.535
-Yes.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.828
-Yes.
-Yes, I remember.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.246
It just happened,
of course you remember.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.248
And it was...
They were delicious, right?

02:03.331 --> 02:06.042
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Tell her. I mean, they were like... Mwah.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.752
They were...
It's hard to explain.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.879
-Props for the weird specificity

02:09.963 --> 02:13.341
and going all in with the "mwah."
But you lie just as bad as your ex.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.969
Sometimes they're so bad at lying,
it's adorable.

02:16.052 --> 02:17.554
Other times, not so much.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.681
-No, seriously, they were delicious.
-Really--

02:19.764 --> 02:22.892
Highly inventive use of the, uh,
cranberry and the Brandy.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.644
-I was gonna mention that, yes.
-Brandy.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.688
And... Well! Look at...
Oh, my God!

02:26.771 --> 02:29.399
-They're selling the house.
-Babe. Babe. Just...

02:29.482 --> 02:32.318
Why didn't Helen mention that to us
when she was baking the cupcakes?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.779
Just let it go. Let it go.

02:35.071 --> 02:37.031
So it's official.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.618
Greg Kinnear's weird little
brother knocks you up, and I'm history?

02:40.743 --> 02:43.079
Okay, that is offensive...

02:43.163 --> 02:44.372
and flattering.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.666
Kylie, I... I don't know where to start.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.710
I'd recommend starting like this:

02:48.793 --> 02:50.295
"My name is Emma,

02:50.378 --> 02:52.380
and I'm a tourist lesbian asshole

02:52.505 --> 02:55.174
who just wasted
five months of your life."

02:55.800 --> 02:58.219
-Kylie, we created the most...
Shaun, come on.

02:58.303 --> 03:02.432
...amazing life together and it really
almost felt like it could be real.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.184
But if I'm completely honest
with myself,

03:05.518 --> 03:07.353
I am in love with these two.

03:08.062 --> 03:11.566
-I really hope--
-Oh, stop. Please, just stop.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.069
Way deep down, I knew that
you were just dragging me through

03:15.153 --> 03:17.280
your elaborate mental breakdown.

03:17.405 --> 03:18.823
Kylie, you're right.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.533
And I'm really sorry.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.161
I didn't just come here
to fight for you, Em.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.167
You becoming managing partner
just stopped being

03:29.250 --> 03:31.377
a "someday" kinda thing, babe.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.215
Carlin's announcing
his retirement <i>and</i> his successor

03:35.340 --> 03:36.799
sooner than expected.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.635
-Like Tuesday.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.720
Only way you don't get it
is if you're not there.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.852
I have no clue why,
but I don't wanna see that happen.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.854
Whoops!

03:49.938 --> 03:52.440
Things just got a little more
complicated, huh?

04:02.075 --> 04:04.452
So... Andy.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.997
-Yep. He's back.
-Crazy. -Bananas.
-All the... fruits.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.675
Are you gonna keep seeing him? Or...

04:20.969 --> 04:23.471
I-I-I don't know.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.307
Well, he did go crazy over me.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.393
I mean, he got drunk

04:28.476 --> 04:30.603
and then he moved to the woods
for a couple weeks.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.313
I could go way crazier than that.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.607
Certifiable, you know.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.486
I'm not an idiot, Nin. I mean, I...

04:40.488 --> 04:42.365
I know I'm not your dream guy.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.158
That's not true.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.953
Actually, I had a sex dream about you.

04:47.078 --> 04:48.705
-Mm-hmm.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.082
Oh, well... do tell.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.167
All I remember is, um,

04:53.251 --> 04:55.211
waking up screaming in a cold sweat.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.046
Yeah, that's called a nightmare.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.882
-Oh, right. Sorry.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.096
Whenever I'm with you,
I always end up smiling.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.933
And...

05:10.143 --> 05:11.853
I'm... I'm starting to think

05:11.936 --> 05:14.731
that maybe that's more
important than it sounds.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.485
That being said, I need a minute.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.197
Oh. Totally. I understand.
Yeah, that... that's fair.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.037
-59...

05:29.120 --> 05:30.913
58...

05:30.997 --> 05:32.332
57...

05:32.874 --> 05:34.167
56...

05:53.394 --> 05:55.021
Shall we sum up?

05:55.104 --> 05:56.773
Uh, could I have some coffee first?

05:57.815 --> 05:58.983
Okay.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.986
So Emma left us
to start a new life in Seattle,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.572
came back, and the three of us had...

06:05.198 --> 06:08.826
objectively transcendent sex.
Would you agree?

06:08.951 --> 06:10.995
-Yes, it was very nice sex.
-Agreed.

06:12.121 --> 06:14.665
And then she left again.
Would you like some strawberries?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.501
Yes, please.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.046
Six weeks later, she finds out
she's miraculously pregnant,

06:20.546 --> 06:24.675
comes all the way back to Seattle
on the midnight train,

06:24.801 --> 06:27.386
and then has an epiphany
that she still loves us

06:27.470 --> 06:30.223
and does indeed want to have a baby.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.017
Okay, just to be clear,
I'm the prick in this story?

06:33.559 --> 06:36.020
-Just this chapter. Seems to rotate.
-Oh.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.980
And then I catch the two of you,

06:38.106 --> 06:40.858
blissful and beaming
after checking out a house

06:40.942 --> 06:43.277
that is so quintessentially
Hawthorne Heights,

06:43.402 --> 06:47.281
it somehow smells like pumpkin spice
from the fuckin' street.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.533
Iz, what's your point?

06:48.616 --> 06:49.826
Here it comes.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.036
Look at me...

06:52.829 --> 06:54.038
in the eye.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.417
Have you already made up your mind
about raising that baby in this loft?

06:59.627 --> 07:00.586
Me?

07:00.711 --> 07:01.838
Yeah, you.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.427
For the record, I never
voted yes on this place, so...

07:08.719 --> 07:09.679
So you hate it?

07:09.804 --> 07:12.974
No, I love it. Are you kidding me?
I've always dreamt of living in a...

07:13.057 --> 07:15.768
-industrial loft like this.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.688
Yeah, and then I got pregnant
and realized there was no way in hell

07:18.771 --> 07:21.315
this brick racquetball court
makes any sense for a baby.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.655
I mean, fuck, you're right.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.657
We'd have to learn sign language

07:29.740 --> 07:32.160
just to have a conversation
while the gnocchi's sleeping.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.619
Here's the thing. If we just...

07:33.744 --> 07:36.038
If you just gave the Wilberg house
a chance,

07:36.164 --> 07:38.541
if you saw the inside of it,
it's, like, it's pretty--

07:38.666 --> 07:41.502
Look, guys, there's no denying
this is complicated,

07:41.627 --> 07:43.921
but we'll figure it out, okay?

07:44.422 --> 07:46.549
Together. We'll figure it out together.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.217
-Whatever. Fine.
-Like everything else.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.637
-Bring it in.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.680
-Okay.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.642
-Get your big Trakarsky lips off my face.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.769
What is it?

07:58.895 --> 08:00.688
-Just my dad.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.648
And...

08:06.110 --> 08:07.612
He keeps trying to give me the boots

08:07.695 --> 08:10.490
he doesn't remember giving me
for my 17th birthday.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.658
Seems like it really means
something to him.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.494
They were Wittner.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.790
-Mm-hmm.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.125
Okay.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.504
I'll go talk to him.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.840
Enjoy your breakfast.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.721
-Bye, babes.
-Bye.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.311
You know what sounds good?

08:40.394 --> 08:42.605
A pineapple and salmon pizza.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.482
-Ugh.
-Mm-hmm.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.526
-Mm-hmm.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.531
We really are pregnant, Em.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.492
Yes, we are.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.049
Hey! There you are!

09:10.174 --> 09:13.553
Our young girls are off
to first day of daycare.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.513
And it's all good.
It's... it's no big deal.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.974
-It's... it's totally fine.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.017
Aren't these little backpacks adorable?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.978
They make these teensy, tiny,
little backpacks

09:22.061 --> 09:24.522
to give to parents who rush
their teensy, tiny kids

09:24.605 --> 09:26.482
off to... the care of complete strangers.

09:26.941 --> 09:27.984
Carmen.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.152
It just seems like yesterday that we were

09:30.236 --> 09:32.780
finally wiping the last
of the baby goop off of Lily.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.199
And Callie... I mean,
she says the F word

09:35.283 --> 09:38.202
better and more frequently
than either of us. And they're just...

09:39.370 --> 09:41.789
...super weird in their...

09:41.872 --> 09:44.917
...amazing incredible ways that nobody
else could possibly understand.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.795
And I thought that you were dropping
them off. Why are you wearing pajamas?

09:48.421 --> 09:50.715
I was just lying down upstairs,
having a little think--

09:50.798 --> 09:54.635
Oh, Jesus, you were upstairs masturbating
while I'm down here losing my shit?

09:54.719 --> 09:58.014
No, I was literally in bed,
having a think this time.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.557
About?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.018
Well, my boss certainly didn't
seem supportive when I said

10:02.101 --> 10:04.270
I wanted to take a month off
to write a children's book.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.731
I didn't know you wanted
to write a children's book.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.900
I don't. I can barely stand to read them,
but that's kind of the point.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.570
You know, I don't wanna be thinking
that I should've done more. -I heard that's a thing.
-No, Dave...

10:15.615 --> 10:17.491
you couldn't be a better father,
trust me.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.078
Yeah, but I could be a father more,
and that's what I want.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.624
So while I was upstairs not masturbating,

10:24.749 --> 10:27.918
I called work and I said I'm either
taking a month off or I'm quitting.

10:28.502 --> 10:30.087
-Well...

10:30.212 --> 10:33.633
Looks like I'll be spending
a month's sabbatical

10:33.716 --> 10:36.802
diligently not writing
a children's book.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.263
And then what?

10:39.347 --> 10:40.640
I don't know.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.060
And that's surprisingly exciting.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.899
Whenever I think I know
all there is to know about you,

10:49.982 --> 10:51.275
you show me more.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
And I love it all.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.658
I realize I could've cleaned
myself up a little bit

10:58.741 --> 11:00.951
before I came down here
to tell you this exciting news.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.745
But, um, I'm definitely...

11:02.828 --> 11:03.996
I've got sleep crusties, for sure.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.040
I mean, I'm in my jimjams,
for Pete's sake.

-I didn't hear anything.

11:17.176 --> 11:18.803
Yeah, I think it was the wind.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.889
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

11:34.402 --> 11:37.530
-If you don't like the color or--
-They're perfect.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.324
They're just boots.

11:45.329 --> 11:47.123
Happy birthday, Peanut.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.343
What is it?

12:02.346 --> 12:06.350
Emma's about to get a huge promotion
at her firm in Seattle.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.146
It's, like, her dream job.
The money's crazy.

12:11.355 --> 12:15.151
And we just got back together,
but she has to consider it, right?

12:19.488 --> 12:21.699
It's fine. Go... go ahead.

12:23.492 --> 12:26.370
Well, you're right.
She does have to consider it.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.456
And she will.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.876
And they'll invite you
to Seattle to live in their house

12:31.959 --> 12:35.588
with their baby
and keep living their life.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.925
Any advice or...

12:43.471 --> 12:44.972
Say no.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.976
They're not gonna do it, Iz.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.103
This is on you.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.773
But I have a confession.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.359
Oh, God.

12:57.651 --> 13:00.070
What else did you do during
your 10

13:02.281 --> 13:05.034
I have a line on a good job
here in Portland,

13:06.785 --> 13:07.745
so, uh...

13:07.828 --> 13:11.999
I'm not entirely impartial
about where you live.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.804
I get it.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.015
Change is scary.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.353
I mean, this is new for all of us,
right? Myself included.

13:32.436 --> 13:35.940
I mean, stakes are gonna be
part of the process.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.735
I shouldn't have raised my voice.
I shouldn't have yelled.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.655
That is a sign of weakness
and not a sign of strength.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.866
I can't demand your respect.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.495
I have to earn it
with calm and confidence.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.207
Also, if you could refrain
from throwing food in Daddy's hair,

13:53.290 --> 13:54.792
that would be really nice,

13:54.875 --> 13:58.587
because a bit of that went in my eye,
and that is a legitimate safety hazard.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.298
Daddy's head is made of poop.

14:01.423 --> 14:03.467
What? Uh, no.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.511
No, for... for Lily's sake, honey,

14:05.594 --> 14:10.015
Daddy's head is made of skull and bone
and hair and teeth, right?

14:10.099 --> 14:12.893
-Not poop. There's no poop.
Poop!

14:13.018 --> 14:14.770
-Say my head's not made of poop!

14:14.853 --> 14:17.356
Say my head's not made of poop!
Say it! Say it! Say it!

14:31.954 --> 14:33.205
People are here.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.790
-Wasn't expecting people yet.
-Me neither.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.625
They're looking at us.
What do we do now? Be calm and be confident.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.004
Cool. And how do we fake that?

14:40.087 --> 14:41.881
Uh, talk low, make 'em strain to listen.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.217
Cool.
So I appreciate you all coming here

14:45.301 --> 14:47.845
-on this first day, and--
-Maybe not.

14:47.928 --> 14:51.807
Good morning, everyone! Welcome
to your first day at <i>The Heights</i>!

14:51.891 --> 14:53.851
Hi! I'm, uh...

14:53.934 --> 14:55.811
-Carmen.
-Right. Carmen.

14:55.895 --> 14:59.523
Weird, 'cause it's been my name
since I was born.

14:59.648 --> 15:02.026
Anyway, I'm really looking
forward to meeting each of you.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.528
But first, I have to avail...

15:04.612 --> 15:06.822
myself of the facilities, as it were.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.948
I...

15:09.575 --> 15:11.535
Oh, I-I have to pee.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.330
Uh...

15:15.831 --> 15:17.249
As do I.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.126
So... just...

15:19.793 --> 15:22.087
-Um...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.676
What do you need?
Uh, do you want some water?

15:27.760 --> 15:30.638
You want me to slap you in the face,
like they do in the movies?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.265
If you don't say "no" by the time
I count to five, I'm just gonna give you

15:33.349 --> 15:35.059
-a good, hard slap.
!

15:35.142 --> 15:38.020
I have no clue how to operate
a fucking magazine

15:38.103 --> 15:41.315
or let alone supervise anybody
over three feet tall.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.360
Okay, give me your phone.
Your phone.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.538
<i>Darling, what's up?</i>

15:56.622 --> 15:58.374
Oh, there's just a lot
of people out there.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.377
Dave, Dave, I... I did the accent.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.381
What do you mean?
The... the not

16:05.589 --> 16:07.549
Oh, for the love of God! Why?

16:07.675 --> 16:10.511
Because I was losing my shit.
And now I'm hiding in the bathroom!

16:10.594 --> 16:12.346
It's not an awesome start, Dave.
It's not awesome!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.765
You're my Wonder Woman.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.892
You got this. Say it back.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.145
I'm your Wonder Woman. I got this.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.107
While I have you on the phone,
do you have any tips for Callie?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.609
She's formidable, and tickling
is no longer doing the trick.

16:25.693 --> 16:29.113
Uh, yes. She thinks there's a monster
prevention device in the closet

16:29.196 --> 16:30.990
that only adults can operate.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.199
-Perfect.
<i></i>

16:32.282 --> 16:33.283
Yes, Wonder Woman?

16:35.494 --> 16:37.162
<i>You're my Wonder Woman.</i>
<i>I really love you.</i>

16:37.287 --> 16:38.872
-Okay, that's enough.
<i>-I love you, too, honey.</i>

16:38.998 --> 16:40.708
-Hey, when you come home tonight,

16:40.791 --> 16:42.126
why don't you, uh... Hello

16:44.086 --> 16:46.213
I wish I had one of those.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.721
Oh.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.266
Ahh. Not bad.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.612
I'll have to call you back.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.990
A depressed Muppet
just flopped into my office.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.241
That's accurate.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.785
Got any new chapters for me?

17:18.120 --> 17:19.246
Nope.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.793
Might I recommend one

17:24.877 --> 17:28.630
about unicorns that lose
themselves in the throuple

17:28.714 --> 17:30.674
and completely neglect
their own lives?

17:35.304 --> 17:38.265
I spoke to Meredith
at Directions.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.477
They're interested in offering you
a counseling job.

17:42.978 --> 17:44.521
Seriously?

17:44.605 --> 17:45.481
Yeah.

17:45.606 --> 17:49.610
But they have some questions
about your... reliability.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.782
What are you doing, kid?

17:58.327 --> 18:01.914
<i>♪ The devil,</i>
<i>he sang his favorite song ♪</i>

18:02.873 --> 18:05.334

18:06.335 --> 18:10.506

18:21.475 --> 18:24.019
Izzy. Hey, you.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.938
Were you guys gonna leave a note?

18:26.855 --> 18:29.608
We're leaving for Seattle
tomorrow at oh-dark thirty.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.821
I guess Spidey Sense does
skip a generation.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.740
-Nothing.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.744
-We packed you a bag.
-Yeah.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.540
I've got the biggest decision
of my life to make tomorrow.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.333
But, you know,
it's not just mine to make.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.043
It's all of ours, the three of us.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.296
And... I really want you guys
there with me.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.144
Jack...

19:06.395 --> 19:07.729
Emma...

19:09.148 --> 19:10.858
I've already made my decision.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.277
What does that mean?

19:13.402 --> 19:15.571
I can't just leave my life.

19:17.531 --> 19:22.369
Assuming I can convince Meredith
I'm not a flake,

19:23.162 --> 19:27.457
I'm getting a full-time
paying job at Directions.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.752
That's great.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.588
Yeah, congratulations.

19:32.671 --> 19:35.591
My best friend is here,
and my dad is looking for a job here.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.384
This is my home.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.012
This is <i>my</i> life.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.059
Well, if you're not going,
we're not going.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.311
-Right.
-So...

19:47.394 --> 19:50.022
No, Em, you have to consider it.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.232
You know I'm right.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.694
I want you guys to go to Seattle.

19:56.486 --> 20:00.324
Think about it, talk about it,
give it a real chance.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.951
And I'm gonna be here
when you get back. So whatever you decide,

20:04.995 --> 20:07.414
I'm not gonna be angry
and I'm not gonna be bitter.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.044
Okay?

20:17.007 --> 20:19.218
<i>Doesn't get</i>
<i>any better than this.</i>

20:19.301 --> 20:21.470
-Mm, got that right.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.314
What the hell?

20:34.524 --> 20:37.027
Okay, hey, remember that part
where I said I need a minute?

20:37.152 --> 20:38.570
Oh, you think...
No, you see,

20:38.654 --> 20:40.447
I'm not What's-His-Name,
the shitty bartender.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.366
No.
I'm, uh...

20:42.950 --> 20:46.036
I'm What's-His-Name,
the shitty delivery guy. So...

20:47.246 --> 20:50.832
Wow. Those are...
so beautifully unarranged.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.669
Yeah. You know,
it's kind of our thing.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.796
Our niche, if you will.

20:55.879 --> 20:58.257
I think we're earthy and wild.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.801
<i>Doesn't get any better than this.</i>

21:00.884 --> 21:02.177
Hey, look, uh...

21:02.261 --> 21:04.388
You can "take a minute" from me
but not from him?

21:04.471 --> 21:06.223
No, he's not here. It's... uh...

21:09.059 --> 21:09.977
that.

21:12.187 --> 21:14.815
Both of you?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.900
You told me to take a beat but not him?

21:16.984 --> 21:19.695
She told you she needs "a beat"?
Told me she needs "a minute."

21:21.071 --> 21:23.198
-Mm.
To choose?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.992
Like, what is this, a competition?

21:25.075 --> 21:27.661
Uh, no. Not like a...
like a dance-off or something.

21:27.744 --> 21:28.704
But...

21:28.787 --> 21:30.872
Hey, now that I said the word
"dance-off" out loud,

21:30.956 --> 21:33.417
let's not entirely discount it, right?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.918
Sounds hilarious.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.714
Come on!

21:39.172 --> 21:40.924
Fine. Whatever. No dance-off.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.011
Those are flowers?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.387
[bottles clinking,
refrigerator door closes]

21:48.765 --> 21:53.145
Two suitors remain,
but I hold just a single beer.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.440
Like <i>The Bachelorette</i>?

21:56.523 --> 21:58.692
Oh, I don't hate it.
I should, but I don't.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.235
I'm in.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.653
Just kidding.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.821
Beer's for me.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.159
Okay, look, here's the deal...

22:07.242 --> 22:10.162
we're gonna meet back here tomorrow,
and I'll reveal my choice.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.998
Your choice?
After what this little shit did to you?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.250
Are you seriously telling me
I'm in a neck-and-neck

22:15.334 --> 22:16.918
with fucking Shaun
the fucking bartender?

22:18.545 --> 22:19.880
No offense, man.

22:19.963 --> 22:22.299
Well, there's no conceivable way
to take that as inoffensive.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.675
Well, competition makes me chippy.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.970
For tomorrow, feel free to flake.
It'll make the decision for me, you know.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.270
I'll be here. I'm not gonna flake.

22:35.353 --> 22:39.024
Thank you.
You can just leave them as well.

22:41.068 --> 22:42.944
You're power trippin', girlfriend.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.863
Ooh, not your girlfriend.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.490
See you if I see you, Andrew.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.576
Mm.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.264
We want you to come with us.
You know that, right?

23:11.389 --> 23:12.808
I do.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.810
Will you do us a favor? Name it.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.815
If it's awesome, if it's perfect...

23:22.943 --> 23:24.778
do you promise you'll think about it?

23:26.071 --> 23:27.697
You know, I read an article recently

23:27.781 --> 23:30.826
that nearly half of Seattle's
population is runaway teens.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.830
-Yeah. Strange but true.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.416
Just go.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.419
I'll keep it in mind.

23:46.424 --> 23:47.634
Wait, wait.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.513
Bye, Eji.
