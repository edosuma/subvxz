10:40.724 --> 10:42.809
That's fucking beautiful,
my G.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.644
You're like a perverted genie
or something.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.146
You like
a white Bagger Vance.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.231
You be making wishes come true.
It's poetic.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.816
Ugh.

10:49.858 --> 10:51.860
This is gonna be my problem,
isn't it?

10:51.901 --> 10:55.363
[computer ringing]

10:55.405 --> 10:57.323
Do I have to do this?

10:57.365 --> 10:58.783
Yes, that is your job.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.660
It fits the job description, Evan.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.496
I'm not really sure
that that's true.

11:03.538 --> 11:04.748
Come on, man. You got this.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.624
You're Evan, dude.
You're the best.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.168
Do it, man. Be a man.

11:08.209 --> 11:11.755
This is when boys turn to men.
Boys to men.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.214
Okay.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.178
Hey, hi.
It's--Donna, is it, right?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.846
<i>Hi, sweetheart.
How's it going?</i>

11:19.888 --> 11:22.140
Uh, it's going great.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.017
- She got big titties?
- Uh...

11:24.059 --> 11:26.186
<i>So you want
to set up a party?</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:27.562
Yup. Party.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.731
But it would be
for... not for me.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.109
- For Joe.
<i>- Okay.</i>

11:33.151 --> 11:35.528
<i>Am I talking to Joe right now?</i>

11:35.570 --> 11:38.031
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm just helping set this up

11:38.073 --> 11:41.618
for my boss,
but it's not for him either.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.787
I have a really weird job.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.914
It just, like,
keeps getting weirder.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.415

cut to the chase.</i>

11:47.457 --> 11:48.416
<i>What do you want?</i>

11:48.458 --> 11:51.169
Just, like,
the standard fare.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.381
But, like, gentle
and respectful

11:54.422 --> 11:56.174
and, like, kind.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
- What the fuck is this?
- Gentle caressing.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.178
- Tender kisses.
- Dude, do you know my grandpa?

12:00.220 --> 12:01.763
Get the fuck--
my Poppy doesn't want kind.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.056

12:03.098 --> 12:04.891
Hey, sorry about that.
Hey, what's up?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.038
he's not feeling so well
and he's--

14:32.080 --> 14:35.000
- You're a prostitute.
- What?

14:35.041 --> 14:37.085
Do you know
that she is a hooker?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.045
No offense, darling.
You're beautiful.

to say.

from our conversation?

I'm gonna have nobody.

19:03.727 --> 19:05.145
What do you want me to do?

19:05.186 --> 19:06.771
Provide the thrust.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.732
Pro--provide the thrust?

19:08.773 --> 19:11.359
Yeah, give him a little help.
That's all he needs.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.986
Once he gets going,
he'll be all right.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.821
It'd be easy for you.
Push him, you know?

19:14.863 --> 19:17.490
- A little boom.
- I don't want to do this.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.742
I know
you don't want to do it.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.160
Who the fuck
would want to do it?

19:20.201 --> 19:21.661
But just do it. We're here.

19:21.703 --> 19:23.121
You want to ruin
boys' night now?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.498
- No, boys' night is over.
- No, it's not over.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.791
I took you guys
out to dinner.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.752
We had a nice time.
Roy got half laid.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.295
It's over.
It's time to go home.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.546
This is your chance

19:31.588 --> 19:33.298
to really do something
for somebody.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.799
Make somebody else
fucking happy

19:34.841 --> 19:36.509
instead of yourself
all the time.

19:36.551 --> 19:37.677
Yeah, I meant, like,
I don't know,

19:37.719 --> 19:39.095
watching the game together,

19:39.137 --> 19:41.348
not helping your friend
fuck a prostitute.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.684
You could do it, Peter.
Do it.

19:44.726 --> 19:47.145
Roy, you sure
this is what you want?

19:47.187 --> 19:50.273
- You'd be doing me a mitzvah.
- There's your answer.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.152
I know you don't want to do it,
but just fucking do it.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.570
All right, come on. Let's go.

19:55.612 --> 19:56.905
Well, I'm not gonna do it.
You do it.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.865
- You're not gonna help?
- He's my fucking friend.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.367
- So what?
- It's disgusting.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.576
You could do this shit.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.911
You've done worse things
than this.

20:02.952 --> 20:03.870
Don't bullshit me.

20:03.912 --> 20:05.705
- Go fucking do it.
- [groans]

20:05.747 --> 20:07.874
- Be a man.
- I am. Fuck you.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.297
Donna, are you cool with this?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.299
100%. Hoist him up.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.093
Fantastic.

20:21.262 --> 20:23.473
[sighs]
Let's get it.

20:23.515 --> 20:24.849
- All right, you ready?
- Okay.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.226
- Yeah.
- Gently. Gently.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.560
Okay, okay.

20:27.602 --> 20:28.812
- Okay, good.
- There you go.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.438
- Good. Get a groove going.
- There you go.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.606
All right, all right,
all right.

20:31.648 --> 20:33.400
Maybe don't talk.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.402
Oh, I feel like
a Make-A-Wish kid.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.112
Oh, Marla would've loved this.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.364
Oh, she's right here
with us, baby.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.492
- She's right here.
- God, I hope not.

20:42.534 --> 20:44.077
Okay, okay. Come on.

20:44.119 --> 20:45.704
- Give me some juice, Petey.
- You feel so good.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.914
I am, dude.
You're fucking huge.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.749
- Yeah, he is.
- Well, that's my knee.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.209
I'll tell you,
will you excuse me a second?

20:51.251 --> 20:52.502
I'll be right back.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.462
- Oh, wait. Ooh, gentle.
- [groans]

20:54.504 --> 20:56.881
- What's up?
- Is this how you fuck?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.133
What?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.884
Why don't you
put your back into it?

20:59.926 --> 21:02.762
We're all adults here.
Now put me back in.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.472
- Oh, oh. Okay, right there.
- Okay.

21:04.514 --> 21:06.891
- Wait, no, that's--okay.
- Gentle. Oh.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.101
- Okay. Okay.
- You in?

21:08.143 --> 21:09.185
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:09.227 --> 21:10.812
- Let's do this, baby.
- Go! [groans]

21:10.854 --> 21:12.355
- Here we go.
- All right.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.732
- And we're rocking.
- Okay.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.400
- Yeah.
- Cooking with gas.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.444
You know,
you're a very sweet kid.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.987
You're very misunderstood.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.864
Right to heaven.
I'm going right to heaven.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.323
Oh, God.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.784
There's a lot of love
in this room right now.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.579
I can't believe I'm having
sex with Pete Davidson.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.456
- Shut the fuck up.
- All right.

Well, no, wait.
What did you guys do?

22:54.916 --> 22:57.293
Nothing.
When I said nothing...

22:57.335 --> 22:59.546
I mean, it's guy stuff.
We had a good time.

22:59.587 --> 23:01.589
We danced, laughed,
Roy had fun.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.300
- Roy had a fucking ball.
- Yeah.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.094
Wow, something--all right,
something's up.

23:06.136 --> 23:08.221
Listen, guys, why can't we
just keep secrets?

23:08.263 --> 23:10.223
Why can't we be a normal family
that's healthy?

23:10.265 --> 23:12.308

- Nothing happened.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.893
