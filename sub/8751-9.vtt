00:05.547 --> 00:07.949
So much has happened here.

00:07.950 --> 00:11.293
I'm going through their
deaths... one, two, three, four.

00:11.294 --> 00:14.340
I didn't even know if I
was gonna live through it.

00:14.341 --> 00:16.103
I could feel them touching.

00:16.104 --> 00:18.595
She was pushed down the stairs.

00:18.596 --> 00:20.740
It is an excruciating death.

00:20.741 --> 00:22.688
- And they hung them.
- They hung them.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.445
They're bent on revenge.

00:24.446 --> 00:25.946
Is it dangerous?

00:25.947 --> 00:29.549
You get bad people in a bad place.

00:29.550 --> 00:33.090
Bad things are gonna happen.

00:34.222 --> 00:36.102
They're being watched.

00:36.103 --> 00:39.010
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.011 --> 00:41.261
This thing likes death.

00:41.262 --> 00:43.044
I see dead people.

00:43.045 --> 00:44.612
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:44.613 --> 00:46.682
I speak to dead people.

00:46.683 --> 00:48.372
And he's pissed off now.

00:48.373 --> 00:49.881
And they speak to me.

00:49.882 --> 00:51.477
His head was cracked.

00:51.478 --> 00:54.457
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.507
This guy was murdered.

00:56.508 --> 00:57.926
I rely on my partner.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.330
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:59.331 --> 01:01.281
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:01.282 --> 01:03.999
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.092
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.093 --> 01:10.005
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:10.006 --> 01:11.158
Why would you stay here?

01:11.159 --> 01:13.282
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.283 --> 01:15.266
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.267 --> 01:16.678
Until the very end.

01:16.679 --> 01:18.452
Stop it.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.616
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:20.617 --> 01:23.022
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:23.023 --> 01:24.377
Or time to get out.

01:24.378 --> 01:29.058
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.074

01:48.765 --> 01:52.468
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

01:52.469 --> 01:55.113
I interview witnesses, local experts,

01:55.114 --> 01:59.141
and look for anything unusual
about the history of the location.

01:59.142 --> 02:03.587
At the end, we meet with our
clients to reveal our findings.

02:03.588 --> 02:06.798
I'm in downtown Seattle to
meet a woman named Darcy.

02:06.799 --> 02:09.734
She was a big-time
skeptic of the paranormal.

02:09.735 --> 02:11.570
Then she bought a restaurant.

02:11.571 --> 02:16.494
Now she's seeing strange things, and she
thinks it's making her physically sick.

02:16.495 --> 02:20.078
She's afraid of losing her
business, her health, and her sanity.

02:20.079 --> 02:24.399
Hopefully, Amy and I can help her out.

02:30.804 --> 02:32.832
Before Amy enters a location,

02:32.833 --> 02:36.022
I clear it of anything that
could be leading information.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.095
This restaurant has a lot of
photographs and historical items.

02:39.096 --> 02:43.702
So it's important I take my
time to cover or remove them all.

02:43.703 --> 02:46.463
Once I'm done...

02:47.533 --> 02:50.773
Amy can begin her walk.

03:17.137 --> 03:20.917
There's, like, too many people.

03:25.682 --> 03:27.143
What's going on?

03:27.144 --> 03:31.524
I'm experiencing about 20 to 30 deaths.

03:33.084 --> 03:35.797
And it's wreaking havoc on my body.

03:35.798 --> 03:39.710
I have all these lives
going through my mind.

03:39.711 --> 03:43.251
There is some crazy [Bleep].

04:00.903 --> 04:02.184
Hey, Darcy.

04:02.185 --> 04:04.369
You sounded really
concerned on the phone.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.774
Okay, what's going on?

04:05.775 --> 04:08.737
I just got this business
a year and a half ago.

04:08.738 --> 04:11.837
And I've had guests that believe
they've been pushed down the stairs,

04:11.838 --> 04:13.512
guests that have seen apparitions.

04:13.513 --> 04:15.429
I have seen apparitions.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.110
I could go on and on.

04:17.111 --> 04:19.319
Okay. Is it affecting business?

04:19.320 --> 04:20.137
It is.

04:20.139 --> 04:24.727
I have my entire life savings into this,
not to mention blood, sweat, and tears.

04:24.728 --> 04:28.315
And I just honestly need to do
something about it, whatever it is.

04:28.316 --> 04:30.308
Now, do you know any
history about this building?

04:30.309 --> 04:32.376
It's the oldest restaurant in Seattle.

04:32.377 --> 04:35.266
It was built in 1890,
and this is approximately,

04:35.267 --> 04:40.078
a year after the great fire that
completely devastated Seattle.

04:40.079 --> 04:43.214
Okay well, how about previous
owners, you ever talk to them?

04:43.215 --> 04:48.216
The only thing I really know is there
were seven owners in the last eight years.

04:48.217 --> 04:52.367
And I can't afford to be
the eighth in nine years.

04:52.368 --> 04:55.068
I can't do it.

04:58.906 --> 05:01.598
A regular person who
spends a lot of time here...

05:01.599 --> 05:04.274
They're gonna see some [Bleep].

05:04.275 --> 05:07.503
They're gonna feel stuff.
They're gonna hear stuff.

05:07.504 --> 05:11.956
If they're sensitive,
they're gonna be messed up.

05:11.957 --> 05:14.302
I can't remember the
last place I've been,

05:14.303 --> 05:16.698
that's had this many conscious entities.

05:16.699 --> 05:18.427
All of them are trying to talk to me,

05:18.428 --> 05:21.218
trying to share how they
died at the same time.

05:21.219 --> 05:26.079
But there's one who
stands out from the rest.

05:32.697 --> 05:35.408
Uh, there's a guy here.

05:35.409 --> 05:37.368
He looks real bad.

05:37.369 --> 05:39.974
Some of his face is missing.

05:39.975 --> 05:43.640
He doesn't like to be interfered with.

05:43.641 --> 05:46.352
His rules still apply.

05:46.353 --> 05:50.013
And he likes to enforce them.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.493
He makes me nervous.

05:57.281 --> 06:00.521
He makes me feel agony.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.701
Darcy, why'd you bring me to this spot?

06:10.702 --> 06:15.672
One night at closing, my manager
was here, and we were arguing.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.408
And it just got misty.

06:17.409 --> 06:19.266
And I said, "Tony, turn around".

06:19.267 --> 06:22.076
"Does it look misty to you over there?"

06:22.077 --> 06:25.015
And he goes, "yeah. Let's go".

06:25.016 --> 06:26.137
Like a fog?

06:26.138 --> 06:28.619
- Like fog.
- That's strange.

06:28.620 --> 06:29.886
Anything else up here?

06:29.887 --> 06:34.046
One night I closed up, and the next
morning all the wine was literally,

06:34.047 --> 06:39.320
thrown from this wine rack all the
way across the floor and broken.

06:39.321 --> 06:40.397
Every bottle?

06:40.398 --> 06:42.858
Every bottle.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.782
And this was intact, this
didn't fall down or anything?

06:45.783 --> 06:48.020
- No, it did not.
- Were you broken into?

06:48.021 --> 06:49.821
No.

06:54.445 --> 06:57.812
This guy will not be quiet.

06:57.813 --> 07:01.918
Well, I feel like if he's
being in a particularly...

07:01.919 --> 07:05.459
Angry mood, you'd feel him.

07:05.772 --> 07:09.100
And he moves a lot of
things all the time.

07:09.101 --> 07:10.743
Like what?

07:10.744 --> 07:15.244
I don't know, just stuff around the bar.

07:16.704 --> 07:20.087
It's weird, because he
doesn't want to be here.

07:20.088 --> 07:23.628
This isn't working for him.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.488
Why'd you bring me down here?

07:31.489 --> 07:34.529
One of my guests came
downstairs, a woman...

07:34.530 --> 07:35.760
Maybe in her 50s.

07:35.761 --> 07:38.539
When she got to the last step...

07:38.540 --> 07:44.255
She says that she feels like she
was pushed down the stairs from here.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.377
Wow.

07:45.378 --> 07:48.457
And a man was coming out of
the bathroom and witnessed her,

07:48.458 --> 07:53.664
and he said she actually went forward
from the top like she was pushed.

07:53.665 --> 07:56.123
- Was she drunk?
- Not at all.

07:56.124 --> 07:58.044
Okay.

08:02.564 --> 08:06.464
This guy whose face is missing...

08:08.454 --> 08:12.894
He doesn't want us to invade his space.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.840
What happens when someone does?

08:22.645 --> 08:25.756
He's, like, push, get
the [Bleep] out of my way.

08:25.757 --> 08:27.453
Is it dangerous?

08:27.454 --> 08:31.354
He will throw people down stairs.

08:34.938 --> 08:39.738
Definitely wanted to
throw me down the stairs.

08:44.401 --> 08:47.532
I've had a number of
customers that say that,

08:47.533 --> 08:51.074
they see a woman go into the
bathroom and shut the door.

08:51.075 --> 08:55.359
So they'll wait, wait, and then finally
when it seems to have taken too long,

08:55.360 --> 08:59.419
they'll kind of push the door open.

08:59.420 --> 09:02.780
And they go in and there's nobody there.

09:02.781 --> 09:06.070
A lot of them will just ask
for their check and leave.

09:06.071 --> 09:08.561
Your employees, how do they
feel about coming down here?

09:08.562 --> 09:10.069
They're uncomfortable.

09:10.070 --> 09:12.585
You're having trouble
keeping customers, obviously.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.201
Your employees are a little freaked out. I
mean, how are you dealing with all of this?

09:16.202 --> 09:17.701
Not well.

09:17.702 --> 09:19.507
I left here on a Friday night.

09:19.508 --> 09:22.344
I was so sick, like,
really, really sick.

09:22.345 --> 09:24.737
So Monday morning I went to the doctor,

09:24.738 --> 09:28.054
and I had bacterial
pneumonia in my right lung,

09:28.055 --> 09:31.697
which had got into my bloodstream.

09:31.698 --> 09:35.488
I actually was in the hospital
for five days in a row.

09:35.489 --> 09:40.860
They can't figure out how I got
that sick that fast when I'm healthy.

09:40.861 --> 09:42.695
How serious did it get?

09:42.696 --> 09:45.561
You know, I didn't actually even
know if I was gonna live through it.

09:45.562 --> 09:48.940
It was as serious as it could be.

09:48.941 --> 09:50.861
Okay.

09:54.207 --> 09:57.807
There's this religious woman.

10:01.582 --> 10:05.422
And she's, like, always praying.

10:06.915 --> 10:10.819
I think that living
people, they see her.

10:10.820 --> 10:14.827
But, like, she's really a very dark...

10:14.828 --> 10:17.228
Dark person.

10:17.633 --> 10:19.979
I don't like her.

10:19.980 --> 10:22.154
She creeps me out.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.975
She's, uh, scary.

10:26.850 --> 10:30.030
She like, picks people.

10:30.095 --> 10:32.359
What do you mean?

10:32.360 --> 10:34.164
She picks the weak.

10:34.165 --> 10:36.802
She picks the weak.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.083
Uh, women.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.219
Sickly people.

10:42.220 --> 10:44.648
And then what does she do?

10:44.649 --> 10:48.429
I think she [Bleep] kills them.

10:56.690 --> 11:01.322
This religious woman, she feels
women are weak and the sickly.

11:01.323 --> 11:03.541
What does she do?

11:03.542 --> 11:07.322
I think she [Bleep] kills them.

11:07.713 --> 11:10.315
How does she do that?

11:10.316 --> 11:12.896
It's a touch.

11:13.162 --> 11:15.922
They [Bleep] die.

11:17.651 --> 11:19.934
Do you get a name on her?

11:19.935 --> 11:21.855
Mary.

11:28.549 --> 11:30.454
So, Matt, how long
you been working here?

11:30.455 --> 11:32.504
- About a year and a half now.
- Okay.

11:32.505 --> 11:33.805
Do you ever work downstairs?

11:33.806 --> 11:35.197
I never work downstairs.

11:35.198 --> 11:37.594
This is my first time
down here in over a year.

11:37.595 --> 11:40.561
Why don't you tell me what's going
on? What have you experienced?

11:40.562 --> 11:41.768
I'd come down here,

11:41.769 --> 11:45.059
with a glass very similar to the
one that's right here on the bar.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.094
I put the glass down,
just as you see now.

11:47.095 --> 11:47.806
Okay.

11:47.807 --> 11:51.760
I made my way around the
back side of the bar here.

11:51.761 --> 11:53.906
When I came back, I
reached for my glass,

11:53.907 --> 11:57.236
and it slid about four
feet, and all I saw was it,

11:57.237 --> 12:00.139
hitting the lip and going over the edge.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.625
Hearing the actual smash.

12:01.626 --> 12:05.628
And I mean, that sound is something that
I'm not gonna forget for a long time.

12:05.629 --> 12:10.953
Now, if walked away and I left you
here, would you be freaking out?

12:10.954 --> 12:12.935
And it just took that
one incident for you.

12:12.936 --> 12:14.491
That's all it took.

12:14.492 --> 12:17.343
Made me a believer.

12:17.344 --> 12:21.213
Does it hurt you financially
because you won't work downstairs?

12:21.214 --> 12:24.286
It would help if I was able to
get down here and get some shifts.

12:24.287 --> 12:26.907
Um, as long as things get
straightened out first.

12:26.908 --> 12:29.015
Well, hopefully we'll
get some answers and,

12:29.016 --> 12:32.492
maybe Amy can come up with a solution
and you can maybe start working down here.

12:32.493 --> 12:34.773
Absolutely.

12:36.790 --> 12:39.146
So, this is his space, so...

12:39.147 --> 12:42.927
He's angry... very, very
angry. He's throwing a fit.

12:42.928 --> 12:47.128
And, you know, he moves a
lot of things all the time.

12:47.129 --> 12:50.549
He is not a happy camper.

12:51.424 --> 12:53.258
The angry man and the religious woman,

12:53.259 --> 12:56.129
seem to be the most powerful
entities in this building.

12:56.130 --> 12:58.981
But there are dozens of other
dead trying to get my attention.

12:58.982 --> 13:01.111
And it's making me physically ill.

13:01.112 --> 13:04.606
I'm experiencing a lot
of other people's deaths.

13:04.607 --> 13:07.886
- How many?
- Probably about 20 or 30.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.167
30 people.

13:11.019 --> 13:12.923
I'm going through their deaths.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.451
One, two, three, four. So...

13:15.452 --> 13:17.824
Why do you think there's so many?

13:17.825 --> 13:19.650
Lots of...

13:19.651 --> 13:21.691
Layers.

13:23.648 --> 13:25.339
So much has happened.

13:25.340 --> 13:28.400
So much has happened.

13:33.576 --> 13:35.545
Dillon, have you ever
experienced anything here?

13:35.546 --> 13:38.463
Yeah, I've actually got
a gentlemen that has uh,

13:38.464 --> 13:40.425
showed himself to me
here in the kitchen.

13:40.426 --> 13:43.609
He's probably showed himself
about a dozen times or so.

13:43.610 --> 13:45.102
Okay, can you describe him?

13:45.103 --> 13:48.766
He's an older gentleman, about 5'8".

13:48.767 --> 13:51.476
Wears a button-up shirt,
double-breasted jacket.

13:51.477 --> 13:53.831
Okay, would you say
he's from a time period?

13:53.832 --> 13:59.049
I would say anywhere from
late 1800s to early 1920s.

13:59.050 --> 14:01.832
He's actually starting
to follow me around now.

14:01.833 --> 14:05.013
- You're kidding.
- No.

14:06.277 --> 14:10.651
I feel like people could
see him... the angry man.

14:10.652 --> 14:14.715
He's wearing, like, a dark,
burgundy, button-down shirt.

14:14.716 --> 14:18.455
And he's probably about your height.

14:18.456 --> 14:21.535
He had to enforce his rules.

14:21.536 --> 14:27.436
If somebody [Bleep] with him, he's the one
who's gonna put a knife in their throat.

14:28.455 --> 14:33.135
Yeah, he knows how to
take care of himself.

14:38.885 --> 14:40.665
Okay, Dillon, what happened in here?

14:40.666 --> 14:42.539
The bartender upstairs...

14:42.540 --> 14:47.050
She comes downstairs to check what
specials I'm gonna run for the day.

14:47.051 --> 14:49.403
Seconds after she gets to
the bottom of the stairs,

14:49.404 --> 14:52.318
60-gallon garbage can...
bang! Bang! Bang!...

14:52.319 --> 14:54.909
Came down the stairs after her.

14:54.910 --> 14:57.430
Misses her by a couple feet.

14:57.431 --> 15:00.667
If the spirit could push a
garbage can down the stairs,

15:00.668 --> 15:03.432
who's to say it couldn't push
a human down the stairs or,

15:03.433 --> 15:07.693
pick up a knife and throw it at you?

15:08.389 --> 15:12.409
I see these little creature things.

15:13.699 --> 15:14.806
What are they, then?

15:14.807 --> 15:17.872
I don't... I can't really
tell because they're all...

15:17.873 --> 15:21.293
Kind of messed-up-looking.

15:21.801 --> 15:25.524
They, like, scurry on the floor.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.218
Almost like crabs.

15:27.219 --> 15:29.655
But they're black and
they're kind of fast.

15:29.656 --> 15:31.444
So, what do they do?

15:31.445 --> 15:34.745
They, like, stalk people.

15:35.808 --> 15:39.828
I can feel them touching, grabbing.

15:40.277 --> 15:45.437
Your whole body reacts,
like, you get those chills.

15:45.799 --> 15:47.521
Ugh.

15:47.522 --> 15:50.378
- You all right?
- One grabbed my leg.

15:50.379 --> 15:52.659
That hurt.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.554
There's these things.

16:09.363 --> 16:10.472
Oof!

16:10.473 --> 16:13.773
They, like, stalk people.

16:15.694 --> 16:19.594
And people do see them for sure.

16:19.721 --> 16:21.129
What would that look like?

16:21.130 --> 16:24.833
They could look like
little child-size mists.

16:24.834 --> 16:27.654
Vengeful, little...

16:28.406 --> 16:30.926
Nasty [Bleep].

16:40.014 --> 16:42.257
Darcy told me that her
restaurant was built

16:42.258 --> 16:46.841
right after a devastating
fire in the late 1800s.

16:46.842 --> 16:48.951
I'm on my way to meet
a local fire historian,

16:48.952 --> 16:54.852
who says it was part of one of the
greatest disasters in Seattle's history.

17:00.597 --> 17:04.815
The two-story wooden structure
that originally was on that site,

17:04.816 --> 17:08.795
was burned during the great
Seattle fire of June 6, 1889.

17:08.796 --> 17:11.064
- How big of a fire was it?
- It was a huge fire.

17:11.065 --> 17:14.308
It burned almost the
entire commercial district.

17:14.309 --> 17:19.532
This is a picture taken of
the aftermath of the fire.

17:19.534 --> 17:22.215
Wow, it actually looks like a war zone.

17:22.217 --> 17:24.352
Now, did anybody die in this fire?

17:24.353 --> 17:25.519
Yes.

17:25.520 --> 17:27.662
A young boy died in the fire,

17:27.663 --> 17:31.930
and after the fire with
these tall walls of brick,

17:31.931 --> 17:36.951
there was this one wall that came
down and ended up killing a gentleman.

17:36.952 --> 17:40.006
Were there any other fires in
or around the Merchants Café?

17:40.007 --> 17:43.850
The only other one that I
know of took place in 1885.

17:43.851 --> 17:46.918
Within a block of the Merchants Café.

17:46.919 --> 17:51.371
It was a huge fire where two
people did lose their life.

17:51.372 --> 17:53.292
Okay.

18:02.405 --> 18:07.690
Before this building was here, there was
another structure here that was smaller.

18:07.691 --> 18:11.615
Awful things happened there. I
think it burned down a few times.

18:11.616 --> 18:14.195
So, these floor things... that's them?

18:14.196 --> 18:17.554
Yeah. They died in a fire.

18:17.555 --> 18:21.292
They're all burned.
They're all nasty. It's bad.

18:21.293 --> 18:24.708
These strange creatures keep
communicating the word "fire" to me.

18:24.709 --> 18:27.263
And they're really angry about it.

18:27.264 --> 18:32.784
They were trapped or stuck,
like they couldn't get out.

18:34.972 --> 18:40.792
And they're very bent on revenge
for what happened to them.

18:42.881 --> 18:46.303
When they get to know the person
that they're gonna mess with.

18:46.304 --> 18:48.583
They learn everything about them.

18:48.584 --> 18:53.455
They are stalkers, like, they hone in,
and they're, like, preying on the weak.

18:53.456 --> 18:57.416
And they'll go after that person.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.699
Now that I know the structure I'm
investigating burned to the ground.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.818
I need to find out who rebuilt it.

19:06.819 --> 19:09.345
A local historian has
agreed to meet me downtown,

19:09.346 --> 19:14.986
and he says the Merchants
Café has a very colorful past.

19:26.106 --> 19:30.743
I understand the original building was
burned down in 1889 during the fires.

19:30.744 --> 19:32.612
How did it get rebuilt?

19:32.613 --> 19:34.415
It was rebuilt in 1890,

19:34.416 --> 19:37.599
as the four-story Victorian
structure that you see today.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.097
One of the first owners
was a man named John Ossner,

19:40.098 --> 19:43.055
who opened the Merchants
Exchange Saloon in the basement.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.157
Okay, now, what did
Ossner do with the place?

19:45.158 --> 19:49.924
Well, in the panic of 1893 when
the economy was just devastated.

19:49.925 --> 19:53.132
Ossner got desperate for revenue
and decided that he would take

19:53.133 --> 19:56.748
what was now the basement and
turn it into an illegal card room.

19:56.749 --> 20:00.650
And then the upstairs
hotel became a brothel.

20:00.651 --> 20:03.342
Okay, so we had a gambling parlor,
we had the bar, and a brothel.

20:03.343 --> 20:05.863
That's right.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.351
When I walked in, I
saw this different...

20:12.352 --> 20:16.155
There were people, lots and lots of
people laughing and having a good time.

20:16.156 --> 20:22.056
And there were prostitutes but
dressed nice, like, old-fashioned.

20:22.607 --> 20:24.068
Any idea when?

20:24.069 --> 20:27.129
1880s. I don't know.

20:29.031 --> 20:32.291
There was really frickin' bad people.

20:32.292 --> 20:38.112
Get bad people in a bad place,
bad things are gonna happen.

20:39.523 --> 20:42.230
So, did Ossner run it the entire time?

20:42.231 --> 20:45.466
No, in 1898, right after the gold rush,

20:45.467 --> 20:49.928
they sold a big portion of the business
to a fellow named F.X. Schreiner.

20:49.929 --> 20:52.933
Schreiner's wife,
Mary, was not approving.

20:52.934 --> 20:57.307
She was a very devout woman,
had gone to convent school.

20:57.308 --> 21:00.974
She definitely had an image to keep.

21:00.975 --> 21:03.114
She died in 1905.

21:03.115 --> 21:04.715
Now, do you know what she died of?

21:04.716 --> 21:07.873
She died of consumption, or
what we call Tuberculosis today.

21:07.874 --> 21:10.288
It came on rather suddenly.

21:10.289 --> 21:14.018
He was heartbroken and went back
to Germany for a period of time.

21:14.019 --> 21:16.662
What happened to the business when
Schreiner went back to Germany?

21:16.663 --> 21:22.563
The other partners brought in a new
bartender by the name of Otto Hink.

21:23.898 --> 21:25.468
What is he, a bodybuilder or something?

21:25.469 --> 21:29.530
He was a wrestler, actually,
and he became the barkeeper.

21:29.531 --> 21:31.209
So what else can you tell me about him?

21:31.210 --> 21:33.918
He had a wife and children in town,

21:33.919 --> 21:38.026
but he also had a habit of
frequenting the brothels himself.

21:38.027 --> 21:41.638
And so the party for
him was over at age 42.

21:41.639 --> 21:45.432
Because he had already
contracted syphilis of the brain,

21:45.433 --> 21:47.662
and he began to have dementia.

21:47.663 --> 21:51.755
He ended up being committed to various
mental hospitals throughout the state,

21:51.756 --> 21:56.101
and lived in sanitariums
for the rest of his life.

21:56.102 --> 21:58.141
We have the certificate of death,

21:58.142 --> 22:01.425
and you see that he
did not die until 1957.

22:01.426 --> 22:03.761
At age 79.

22:03.762 --> 22:08.322
It was a very long
and excruciating death.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.467
Mm.

22:20.550 --> 22:22.619
He's very, very, very physical.

22:22.620 --> 22:28.520
Like, I see iron fists ran this
place with, like, an iron fist.

22:29.043 --> 22:31.733
This angry man is in so much agony.

22:31.734 --> 22:35.750
He keeps pulling me back to the
upstairs bar to try and share his pain.

22:35.751 --> 22:38.540
Something about a child or children.

22:38.541 --> 22:42.206
And he wants to take
care of them but can't.

22:42.207 --> 22:46.167
Doesn't understand where they are.

22:46.589 --> 22:50.085
He's, like, a pretty buff guy.

22:50.086 --> 22:52.428
Like, he fought a lot.

22:52.429 --> 22:55.006
He's angry, confused...

22:55.007 --> 22:57.647
Hurt, and he...

22:58.523 --> 23:02.603
Doesn't understand what's happening.

23:13.593 --> 23:17.391
So far, I know that the
Merchants Café was a brothel,

23:17.392 --> 23:20.291
and burned to the
ground in a deadly fire.

23:20.292 --> 23:23.317
But a place that old
has to have more secrets.

23:23.318 --> 23:27.837
So I'm at the library, seeing
what else I can uncover.

23:27.838 --> 23:31.178
Digging through the archives, I
was shocked to discover not one,

23:31.179 --> 23:34.296
but two executions happened
directly across the street,

23:34.297 --> 23:38.377
from the location I'm investigating.

23:41.873 --> 23:43.774
I'm on my way to meet a Seattle cop,

23:43.775 --> 23:47.777
who studied the executions across
the street from Merchants Café.

23:47.778 --> 23:53.678
He says he's got information
that will definitely help my case.

24:00.235 --> 24:02.867
Jim, I read an article where
it said in the late 1800s,

24:02.868 --> 24:05.922
there was a lynch mob
that grabbed two guys.

24:05.923 --> 24:07.147
And they hung them.

24:07.148 --> 24:10.274
Uh, it looks like right across the
street from a property I'm investigating.

24:10.275 --> 24:11.393
That's correct.

24:11.394 --> 24:14.426
On the 18th of January, 1882,

24:14.427 --> 24:16.672
two murder suspects
were being arraigned.

24:16.673 --> 24:19.501
They were alleged to have
murdered a prominent businessman.

24:19.502 --> 24:22.338
Uh, George Reynolds, the previous night.

24:22.339 --> 24:25.261
At 9:30 in the morning,
they were arraigned.

24:25.262 --> 24:29.935
By 1:00, the Judge had determined there
was enough evidence to commit them...

24:29.936 --> 24:32.046
- To be held over for the grand jury.
- Okay.

24:32.047 --> 24:35.181
At which point a lynch mob formed.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.395
They overpowered the
two police officers,

24:37.396 --> 24:40.271
took the two suspects
down to Occidental Square.

24:40.272 --> 24:41.389
Okay.

24:41.390 --> 24:44.753
Here's a photograph of the
sketch that was done at the time.

24:44.754 --> 24:49.204
They put a rope around each one of their
neck, and the crowd started pulling.

24:49.205 --> 24:52.232
It was a particularly gruesome
scene. It was not actually a hanging.

24:52.233 --> 24:53.966
It was a strangulation death.

24:53.967 --> 24:56.077
The crowd would yank
on these ropes so hard,

24:56.078 --> 24:58.933
that the suspects' heads
would bounce off the beam.

24:58.934 --> 25:04.106
And they would basically stay there
until they had strangled to death.

25:04.107 --> 25:05.930
It was a very painful, slow death.

25:05.931 --> 25:11.691
It may have taken them up to
five minutes or more to die.

25:15.732 --> 25:19.139
We have these two guys who
were murdered or something.

25:19.140 --> 25:22.107
Or executed, I don't know.
They're [Bleep] criminals.

25:22.108 --> 25:25.126
These guys, too. I think
they're [Bleep] criminals, too.

25:25.127 --> 25:29.172
I think they're bad people.
All these people are not good.

25:29.173 --> 25:32.189
And then I see, like, this guy tied up.

25:32.190 --> 25:34.486
And then the other guy next to him,

25:34.487 --> 25:38.244
is like tied up, too,
but he's just dead, dead.

25:38.245 --> 25:41.329
Like, he's asleep dead.

25:41.330 --> 25:43.970
Like a coma for a dead person, okay?

25:43.971 --> 25:48.318
So, I can't distinguish
if cops killed him.

25:48.319 --> 25:49.806
There's no justice.

25:49.807 --> 25:54.067
I'm getting like, there's no justice.

25:55.044 --> 25:56.625
Three people here, though.

25:56.626 --> 26:00.766
There is three people. Shortly after this
happened, the crowd went down to the jail,

26:00.767 --> 26:03.793
broke down the door,
overpowered the Sheriff.

26:03.794 --> 26:05.886
And pulled out another suspect,

26:05.887 --> 26:09.848
who was waiting to be heard on charges
of killing one of our police officers.

26:09.849 --> 26:13.110
They dragged him down to the gallows.

26:13.111 --> 26:16.141
The last thing he saw was
the two corpses hanging,

26:16.142 --> 26:19.820
on the beam, faces
blue, tongues swollen.

26:19.821 --> 26:22.356
And he realized he
would be the next to die.

26:22.357 --> 26:24.009
Right before they hung him up, he said,

26:24.010 --> 26:26.185
"if you hang me, you're
hanging an innocent man".

26:26.186 --> 26:29.897
At which point, the crowd strung him
up the same as they did the other two.

26:29.898 --> 26:32.274
So, what's the story? Was he
innocent? Was he... you know?

26:32.275 --> 26:34.879
Well, based on our research, he
very well may have been innocent.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.745
The officer that he shot,

26:36.746 --> 26:39.431
was in plain clothes chasing
him down the street with a gun.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.661
He thought the officer may
have been a robbery suspect,

26:41.662 --> 26:43.553
so he turned and fired his own gun,

26:43.554 --> 26:46.930
since many people carried
their own pistols back then.

26:46.931 --> 26:49.697
Before the officer died
that night, he said that,

26:49.698 --> 26:53.182
the suspect may have not been
aware that he was a police officer,

26:53.183 --> 26:56.964
and so he may have inadvertently
been just defending himself.

26:56.965 --> 27:01.165
- And they hung him.
- They hung him.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.259
During my walk, I encountered
dozens of dead people.

27:12.260 --> 27:15.579
But the angry and confused
man stood out above them all.

27:15.580 --> 27:19.180
Some of his face is missing.

27:21.407 --> 27:25.727
He had a hat and kind of rolls under.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.314
There was, like, a scar here.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.153
Mm-hmm.

27:30.154 --> 27:32.337
And it's almost like...

27:32.338 --> 27:34.438
A hole.

27:34.601 --> 27:36.959
Did you get a feel that
he's from the present time?

27:36.960 --> 27:40.560
Oh, no. He's from way back.

27:42.070 --> 27:45.490
Amy, is this who you saw?

27:48.436 --> 27:50.296
Yes.

28:09.845 --> 28:11.675
Now that Amy and I are finished,

28:11.676 --> 28:14.391
with our investigations
of Darcy's property.

28:14.392 --> 28:16.899
We're ready to reveal what we've found.

28:16.900 --> 28:19.969
Darcy bought this place
about a year and a half ago.

28:19.970 --> 28:22.871
She never believed in
the paranormal at all.

28:22.872 --> 28:24.706
Then she started working here.

28:24.707 --> 28:27.042
She actually ran out of here
three times, scared to death.

28:27.043 --> 28:28.882
She's afraid of losing her employees.

28:28.883 --> 28:30.677
She's losing business.

28:30.678 --> 28:32.044
Matt works here.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.835
Matt's so afraid to go
downstairs, he's losing shifts.

28:34.836 --> 28:37.504
It's one of these things
that's eating at him.

28:37.505 --> 28:39.325
So with that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy,

28:39.326 --> 28:44.611
and she's gonna tell us a
little bit about her walk.

28:44.612 --> 28:46.157
Well, the first thing that I...

28:46.158 --> 28:48.556
The first thing that I
really want to say is that,

28:48.557 --> 28:50.517
this is a very difficult walk.

28:50.518 --> 28:53.334
Because there are a lot of dead.

28:53.335 --> 28:54.951
Like 30 people.

28:54.952 --> 28:56.711
It was pretty chaotic.

28:56.712 --> 28:59.333
And so I went downstairs,

28:59.334 --> 29:03.039
saw these two men that were executed,

29:03.040 --> 29:06.388
and whoever killed them tortured them.

29:06.389 --> 29:08.417
Like, they were tied up.

29:08.418 --> 29:11.865
And the other thing that was really
strange was I kept hearing somebody say...

29:11.866 --> 29:13.505
"There was no justice".

29:13.506 --> 29:18.192
And that it had something
to do with the police.

29:18.193 --> 29:22.252
I mean, she almost nailed this
down to what really happened here.

29:22.253 --> 29:27.255
Back in the late 1800s, there was
two men that murdered a merchant.

29:27.256 --> 29:31.533
They put him in jail, they got arraigned
the next day, but a mob took over.

29:31.534 --> 29:33.917
And they went and they
grabbed these two guys,

29:33.918 --> 29:36.892
and literally about
200 feet from here...

29:36.893 --> 29:39.812
They made a makeshift gallows.

29:39.813 --> 29:42.269
And they strung them up.

29:42.270 --> 29:45.434
Now, these guys were not
hung in the normal fashion.

29:45.435 --> 29:48.201
Basically, they would pull them up.

29:48.202 --> 29:49.386
Oh, my God.

29:49.387 --> 29:52.880
They kept pulling them up
till their heads hit the top.

29:52.881 --> 29:55.648
So these guys were struggling.

29:55.649 --> 29:58.050
Now, you see there's a third guy?

29:58.051 --> 30:01.780
This guy had been in jail for about a
month for murdering a police officer.

30:01.781 --> 30:05.057
So they went and got him,
and they strung him up.

30:05.058 --> 30:08.777
Thing is, he might've
been an innocent man.

30:08.778 --> 30:10.520
Wow.

30:10.521 --> 30:13.268
First time I've ever heard of this.

30:13.269 --> 30:16.329
It's pretty gruesome.

30:19.249 --> 30:21.888
So, what else did you see on your walk?

30:21.889 --> 30:25.256
I felt like this was a
really bad area at one time.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.590
But I got in here, parties...

30:28.591 --> 30:30.898
And dancing and uh...

30:30.899 --> 30:32.969
Prostitutes.

30:32.970 --> 30:34.566
What time period are you talking about?

30:34.567 --> 30:37.039
It was, like, the 1880s.

30:37.040 --> 30:40.773
People were very well-dressed in here.

30:40.774 --> 30:43.144
Well, during my research, I came across,

30:43.145 --> 30:47.299
a guy by the name of F.X.
Schreiner who owned the place.

30:47.300 --> 30:52.580
There's a picture of him...
this is F.X. Schreiner.

30:53.416 --> 30:55.923
He ran downstairs as a gambling parlor.

30:55.924 --> 30:58.199
Up here was the booze.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.735
And then there was a brothel upstairs.

31:00.736 --> 31:03.165
He had a lot of people
coming through here,

31:03.166 --> 31:05.874
to indulge in seedy
things that were going on.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.215
Interesting.

31:08.482 --> 31:10.645
How'd the rest of the walk go?

31:10.646 --> 31:14.939
So, I'm downstairs, and
I'm by the bathrooms...

31:14.940 --> 31:18.240
And this lady comes out.

31:18.762 --> 31:21.067
She was really, really religious.

31:21.068 --> 31:23.752
And uh, she's very solid.

31:23.753 --> 31:27.893
Which means she has a lot of power.

31:27.906 --> 31:30.216
I felt like people could see her.

31:30.217 --> 31:32.151
I don't like her very much.

31:32.152 --> 31:34.972
Her name is Mary.

31:35.069 --> 31:38.310
She can make contact with people.

31:38.311 --> 31:41.142
She'll just poke or tap.

31:41.143 --> 31:45.523
And she goes after people who are weak.

31:45.882 --> 31:51.762
Like older people, sick people,
children, and especially women.

31:52.500 --> 31:58.080
And when she touches people,
it's like a death sentence.

32:00.228 --> 32:03.348
Well, I don't want to die.

32:03.349 --> 32:06.176
Why don't you tell Amy about,

32:06.177 --> 32:09.665
some of your customers and what
they've seen down in the bathroom.

32:09.666 --> 32:12.063
Four different times that I know of,

32:12.064 --> 32:15.767
people go downstairs and have
seen a woman go in the bathroom,

32:15.768 --> 32:18.062
and there's nobody in the bathroom.

32:18.063 --> 32:21.865
People have come upstairs after that
and asked for their check and left.

32:21.866 --> 32:23.226
Wow.

32:23.227 --> 32:25.040
Now, you said her name was Mary?

32:25.041 --> 32:25.915
Yes.

32:25.916 --> 32:27.851
The wife of F.X. Schreiner...

32:27.852 --> 32:29.940
She was a very pious, religious woman...

32:29.941 --> 32:34.937
Didn't like the fact that her husband
was making money with prostitutes.

32:34.938 --> 32:36.992
She wanted to be on
the high end of society.

32:36.993 --> 32:39.873
Her name was Mary.

32:39.996 --> 32:42.742
This is a picture of her.

32:42.743 --> 32:47.959
Do you think the woman you
saw is this Mary Schreiner?

32:47.960 --> 32:49.820
Yes.

32:58.086 --> 33:00.011
What else you wind up
seeing on your walk?

33:00.012 --> 33:03.488
I was up here, and I met...

33:03.489 --> 33:07.007
A really, really interesting
guy behind the bar.

33:07.008 --> 33:10.330
And he was very forceful.

33:10.331 --> 33:12.714
Also very physical.

33:12.715 --> 33:18.143
He probably ran this place and
ran it with, like, an iron fist.

33:18.144 --> 33:22.267
But he's very confused
about what's happening.

33:22.268 --> 33:24.614
It's really sad.

33:24.615 --> 33:29.581
He also felt that he wanted
to take care of a child...

33:29.582 --> 33:32.448
His child... but he can't.

33:32.449 --> 33:34.999
Let me tell you about
a guy named Otto Hink.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.695
When Mary died, F.X.
Schreiner decided to go back

33:38.696 --> 33:40.949
to Germany with his
kids for a little while.

33:40.950 --> 33:43.261
And Otto Hink took
over running the place.

33:43.262 --> 33:46.982
He was a wrestler. Strong guy.

33:47.230 --> 33:50.635
You know, he was the
bouncer. He was the bar guy.

33:50.636 --> 33:52.393
You said he was confused, right?

33:52.394 --> 33:54.224
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

33:54.225 --> 33:56.865
He liked to visit the brothel himself.

33:56.866 --> 34:00.718
Apparently, he contracted
syphilis of the brain.

34:00.719 --> 34:05.187
So at a young age... 42... he
started going a little mental.

34:05.188 --> 34:06.300
Wow.

34:06.301 --> 34:09.648
He spent 37 years in
mental asylums till he died,

34:09.649 --> 34:11.059
- at the age of 79.
- Oh, my gosh.

34:11.060 --> 34:12.692
Are you kidding me?

34:12.693 --> 34:14.371
It's kind of like dementia.

34:14.373 --> 34:20.132
He was obviously in no condition
to take care of his kids.

34:20.505 --> 34:22.480
He's very, very territorial.

34:22.481 --> 34:26.643
Especially about the
bar area, and back there.

34:26.645 --> 34:28.888
He's very protective of his space.

34:28.889 --> 34:33.016
And if you get in his way, he
can push you out of the way.

34:33.018 --> 34:35.431
Tell Amy what happened.

34:35.433 --> 34:38.416
I went downstairs, and
I put a glass on the bar,

34:38.417 --> 34:40.719
and the glass actually slid off,

34:40.721 --> 34:44.317
the opposite side of the bar
and smashed on the ground.

34:44.318 --> 34:46.645
One night, I closed,

34:46.646 --> 34:50.047
and the next morning, he opened,

34:50.047 --> 34:54.315
and every bottle of wine had
been thrown out of the wine rack,

34:54.317 --> 35:00.217
and broken onto the floor with red
wine running out the front door.

35:00.221 --> 35:02.023
Wow.

35:02.024 --> 35:04.246
Your chef, Dillon...

35:04.247 --> 35:07.152
He's seen a guy...

35:07.153 --> 35:10.081
Like 15 times downstairs.

35:10.082 --> 35:13.380
Do you think the guy
you saw is Otto Hink?

35:13.381 --> 35:15.631
I think it's very likely.

35:15.632 --> 35:19.232
I did a sketch of this man.

35:22.735 --> 35:24.595
Wow.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.236
[Bleep].

35:26.237 --> 35:28.697
What's that?

35:41.489 --> 35:44.691
Do you think the guy
you saw is Otto Hink?

35:44.692 --> 35:48.112
I think it's very likely.

35:59.467 --> 36:00.654
[Bleep].

36:00.655 --> 36:03.115
What's that?

36:03.311 --> 36:04.896
What's with the face?

36:04.897 --> 36:06.255
It was an injury.

36:06.256 --> 36:10.638
I don't know if he
was shot, stabbed, cut.

36:10.639 --> 36:13.107
I mean, it's definitely the same mouth.

36:13.108 --> 36:15.388
Same nose.

36:18.958 --> 36:21.053
I don't like him looking at me.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.723
It's kind of creepy.

36:23.724 --> 36:27.204
I don't like that at all.

36:31.899 --> 36:36.039
In the basement, I saw these things.

36:38.151 --> 36:41.971
They don't look like crabs,
but they move like crabs.

36:41.972 --> 36:46.592
They were people, and
they died in a fire.

36:46.998 --> 36:49.366
They were somehow kind of trapped.

36:49.367 --> 36:52.005
They're very angry about that,

36:52.006 --> 36:56.576
and they're very bitter,
and they want revenge.

36:56.577 --> 37:00.512
The people who died in the fire are
filled with so much hatred and vengeance.

37:00.513 --> 37:04.064
That in death, they show
themselves in disturbing ways.

37:04.065 --> 37:09.965
If you were to see them, it would
look like a child-sized black mist.

37:10.473 --> 37:12.605
- You said they died in a fire.
- Yeah.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.989
Back in 1889, there
was the big fire here.

37:14.990 --> 37:19.275
It was probably the worst
fire in Seattle's history.

37:19.276 --> 37:22.010
It's believed two people died in it.

37:22.011 --> 37:24.899
And four years prior to this one,

37:24.900 --> 37:28.685
about a block away, another
two men died in a fire.

37:28.686 --> 37:30.144
Wow.

37:30.145 --> 37:31.755
You said it was a mist, right?

37:31.756 --> 37:33.856
Uh-huh.

37:36.954 --> 37:39.702
One night, I was arguing with
the General Manager up here,

37:39.703 --> 37:41.773
and it just got misty.

37:41.774 --> 37:46.648
Over in the corner, it was dark, like,
where you could not see through it.

37:46.649 --> 37:49.709
And then we ran out.

37:51.717 --> 37:54.672
It's unusual what they can do.

37:54.673 --> 37:57.184
They can make people sick.

37:57.185 --> 38:01.489
They can make you feel like
you're getting chills...

38:01.490 --> 38:03.376
Nauseous...

38:03.377 --> 38:05.951
And can't breathe.

38:05.952 --> 38:09.037
2½, 3 weeks ago, I left here,

38:09.038 --> 38:13.593
and by the time I got
home, I was so sick.

38:13.594 --> 38:16.086
I went to the hospital and,

38:16.087 --> 38:20.047
I had pneumonia in my right lung.

38:20.183 --> 38:23.838
Then the bacteria from my pneumonia
had actually got into my bloodstream,

38:23.839 --> 38:25.705
and my blood was infected.

38:25.706 --> 38:26.587
Oh, my gosh.

38:26.588 --> 38:29.629
And I thought I was gonna die.

38:29.630 --> 38:32.810
I was a mess. A mess.

38:38.479 --> 38:41.315
So, Darcy, you've seen the
results of the investigation.

38:41.316 --> 38:45.734
You obviously got more than you
bargained for when you bought this place.

38:45.735 --> 38:50.425
The big question is, is it safe
for you, your employees to be here?

38:50.426 --> 38:56.134
To get that critical answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:56.135 --> 39:00.339
It's not really safe for
you to be here right now.

39:00.340 --> 39:04.480
Definitely don't go in the basement.

39:04.703 --> 39:08.199
There's things you can do...

39:08.200 --> 39:10.431
For the lady.

39:10.432 --> 39:12.970
The way to get rid of her is,

39:12.971 --> 39:18.076
to find a medium who has
a background in counseling.

39:18.077 --> 39:22.376
And who also hopefully
is some type of healer.

39:22.377 --> 39:27.222
If it goes well, it'll get
to the point where she leaves.

39:27.223 --> 39:30.651
If the medium isn't making
any headway with her,

39:30.652 --> 39:35.382
then you're going to
have to make her leave.

39:35.383 --> 39:40.243
And that obviously
involves a type of exorcism.

39:41.542 --> 39:47.045
The other thing with that medium
is for her to do a cleansing on you.

39:47.046 --> 39:51.066
So that you won't get sick again.

39:52.262 --> 39:55.802
As far as he's concerned...

39:55.993 --> 39:58.516
I think he should stay.

39:58.517 --> 40:00.429
When I first encountered the angry man,

40:00.430 --> 40:03.363
he was lashing out, and
it made me really nervous.

40:03.364 --> 40:09.001
But after a while, it became clear he
was only trying to protect this location.

40:09.002 --> 40:10.844
I know you don't want to hear that.

40:10.845 --> 40:16.185
If we can play along well,
then I'm okay with that.

40:17.714 --> 40:19.754
So, what about those creatures?

40:19.755 --> 40:20.845
Uh...

40:20.846 --> 40:25.526
For them, the way that
they died was awful.

40:25.979 --> 40:29.391
And there was no respect there.

40:29.392 --> 40:33.452
I would like them to
have a funeral service.

40:33.453 --> 40:35.640
Followed by a blessing.

40:35.641 --> 40:39.999
So, if they get this funeral service
done, will this move these creatures on?

40:40.000 --> 40:41.801
Well, it's part of the process.

40:41.802 --> 40:46.207
So, the funeral and then the blessing.
And that will help to move them on.

40:46.208 --> 40:48.980
Who do you think made Darcy sick, then?

40:48.981 --> 40:53.000
I think it's the woman
in black downstairs.

40:53.001 --> 40:55.881
I think it was her.

40:55.882 --> 40:59.732
What kind of a risk are we talking about
with her, if she doesn't listen to you?

40:59.733 --> 41:02.853
Well, she'd kill her.

41:03.382 --> 41:06.526
Darcy, it sounds like
we got here just in time.

41:06.527 --> 41:09.728
That's a lot to lay on
you guys in one night.

41:09.729 --> 41:12.031
What are you gonna do?

41:12.032 --> 41:14.972
We're gonna do it.

41:15.484 --> 41:17.308
We have nothing to lose.

41:17.309 --> 41:19.551
You have everything to gain, actually.

41:19.552 --> 41:21.954
Gain your health back. Hopefully,
business will be better.

41:21.955 --> 41:25.780
I really care about Darcy's
business, as well as her well-being.

41:25.781 --> 41:31.681
So I'll do everything I can to make
sure that her business is successful.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.211
I really hope Darcy follows my advice.

41:35.212 --> 41:39.285
This way, all the entities in her
restaurant will be able to move on.

41:39.286 --> 41:41.947
If she doesn't, I fear
not only for her safety,

41:41.948 --> 41:46.508
but her employees' and
customers', as well.
