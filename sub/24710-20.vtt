I’m sure you've testified

you win the Mapp hearing,

00:49.049 --> 00:50.091

as evidence the heroin you confiscated

00:54.429 --> 00:56.890

Describe why you entered the apartment,
Detective Sorenson,

what you found there,
and what you did subsequently.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.738
(CLEARS THROAT)
I was backing up an undercover operation

01:11.821 --> 01:13.531
being conducted
in the first-floor apartment

01:13.615 --> 01:15.075
at 427 Jane Street.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.869
There came a point
I determined via surveillance

01:18.119 --> 01:20.038
the life of another detective
was put at risk

01:20.121 --> 01:23.083
by a man I came to later identify
as Malcolm Cullinan

01:23.541 --> 01:26.669
trying to force the undercover
to inject herself with heroin.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.297
(INHALES)
Being the detective was in jeopardy,

01:29.839 --> 01:33.760
I and other detectives from the 15th squad
forced entry into that apartment,

01:34.010 --> 01:36.554
and at that point,
we took Mr. Cullinan into custody.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.309
What, if any, other police actions
did you take then?

01:41.601 --> 01:44.187
(INHALES) As part of the arrest process,
I and my partners,

01:44.270 --> 01:47.273
we took possession of a video camera,
and the undercover detective

01:47.357 --> 01:50.777
took possession of the narcotics
Mr. Cullinan was trying to make her use.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.947
While searching the premises
for other contraband or a weapon,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.866
we also found a note
identifying the whereabouts

01:56.950 --> 01:58.076
of the apartment's owner.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.453
At that point, I and my partner,
we left the premises

02:00.537 --> 02:02.747
and went to pick up the owner, Mr. Knox.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.333

he's a baldheaded prick. (CHUCKLES)

36:55.504 --> 36:57.632
The relevant point,
when I’m on that stand,

36:57.757 --> 36:59.759
I can play straight
as good as any of them.

37:00.259 --> 37:05.348
"Yes, Mr. Sinclair. No, Mr. Sinclair."
Just like I thought you walked upright.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.851
Let's see, to paraphrase,

37:09.310 --> 37:10.811
you feel I'm other than human.

37:11.520 --> 37:15.066
Sometimes you see me as a snake
or a plague carrier...

37:15.233 --> 37:16.234
A rat, in other words.

37:16.943 --> 37:20.821
-I also remind you of a vampire.
-Yeah. I'll leap in when I disagree.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.240
Rich descriptions,

37:22.740 --> 37:25.409
but I don't think you've yet plumbed
the depths of your feeling.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.495
Otherwise, why keep searching?

37:29.163 --> 37:32.416
One name, detective,
if your feet were to the fire.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.212
Asshole.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.633
-Doesn't ring true.
-Why don't you help me out?

37:40.800 --> 37:44.845
Tomorrow, when I have you on the stand,
I'll help you crystallize your feelings

37:44.929 --> 37:48.391
about who I am and what I can do,
and why you're so afraid of me.

37:48.599 --> 37:52.144
(SCOFFS) In your dreams, pal.
That's where I'm afraid of you.

37:52.436 --> 37:55.856
Yes. Dreams can be
very frightening places.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.528
You're getting old, Sinclair.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.490
Day by day.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.742
What brings that to mind?

38:07.451 --> 38:08.744
You forgot what you came for.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.163
No.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.958
Get a good night's rest.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.796
What'd help there is you walking
back over here and kissing my polish ass.

38:19.380 --> 38:20.715
Come on, Sinclair.

38:20.881 --> 38:25.177
Bring your mole self back and pucker up!
I'll treat you to the red-eye special!

38:25.469 --> 38:26.804
(DOOR CLOSING)

38:29.640 --> 38:31.350
Late for his cobra lessons.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.695
I gotta get a sign made...

38:42.862 --> 38:45.239
"Did not shoot Amidou Diallo.
I wasn't there."

38:45.656 --> 38:48.492
-"I didn't have nothin' to do with it."
-Yeah. Like that would make a difference.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.453
Well, we're all totally guilty.

38:51.746 --> 38:53.039
AMES: We're guilty in our hearts.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.499
Only reason we weren't there,
we were held up in traffic.

38:55.750 --> 38:58.377
-JAMES: Anyone unfairly treated.
-GREG: Yeah. Exactly.

38:58.878 --> 39:01.756
Any bad experience,
equivalent to getting shot 41 times.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.883
Not to excuse what happened.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.302
Mm. No one's standing up
for what happened.

39:06.677 --> 39:09.263
Any one of those guys
that threw any one of those 41 shots

39:09.347 --> 39:11.015
recognizes they were wrong.

39:11.265 --> 39:13.851
They were wrong tactically
before they ever threw the shots.

39:14.143 --> 39:18.064
-No one's excusing that aspect.
-(INHALES) Good night. (EXHALES)

39:21.650 --> 39:22.985
Good night, boss.

39:25.279 --> 39:26.489
(EXHALES)

39:26.906 --> 39:29.450
They'd pray God
to get back that ten or 12 seconds

39:29.533 --> 39:31.452
thinking one of them had been shot.

39:32.661 --> 39:34.080
It hurts your feelings, that's all.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.791
Try to do a decent job.

39:45.716 --> 39:48.511
You're gonna tell me to tell you
what I think you are?

39:48.928 --> 39:52.139
No. No, I’m gonna tell you
what I think of you.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.601
And I got no word budget, either.

40:00.147 --> 40:03.567
"One word. Who am I?"

40:03.984 --> 40:07.071
(SCOFFS) Yeah, you're a toad, pal.

40:07.446 --> 40:12.201
You are one of those, uh,
one of those ghouly stone monsters that...

40:12.410 --> 40:15.037
you crouchin' on the sides
of a building, you know.

40:15.162 --> 40:18.374
(EXHALES) A big lizard
with his tongue flicking out...

40:18.541 --> 40:22.420
(CHUCKLES) ...trappin' humans. (LAUGHS)

40:24.797 --> 40:26.841
(SIGHS)

40:29.760 --> 40:31.554
I don't think so, ass face.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.974
I'll use as many words as I want.

40:35.933 --> 40:36.976
(SCOFFS)

40:40.146 --> 40:42.523
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

40:43.774 --> 40:45.860
-DANNY: Okay. Thanks.
-(EXHALES) You're off the hook.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.863
-For what?
-The hearing tomorrow. I'm testifying.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.407
-Your wife changed her mind?
-I changed mine.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.869
You can go to bat
against this guy another time.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.122
I didn't know that's what it was about.

40:59.373 --> 41:00.833
You gonna crack wise with me now?

41:01.041 --> 41:02.251
I thought we were just
looking to make sure

41:02.334 --> 41:05.296
evidence wasn't excluded, Andy.
What, it's about hand-to-hand combat?

41:05.379 --> 41:08.549
That's correct. That's exactly what it is.
And when you grow up, you'll realize it.

41:09.592 --> 41:10.843
When I grow up, huh?

41:13.512 --> 41:14.763
-Ready?
-Yeah.

41:14.889 --> 41:15.973
(DANNY EXHALES)

41:19.435 --> 41:22.605
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

41:43.792 --> 41:46.128
Andy, I think it's a really bad idea.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.339
Gee, that's a fresh perspective.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.549
I keep repeating myself,
hoping that I'll be understood.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.760
I understand you. I just don't agree.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.804
Frankly, you don't have to.

41:57.973 --> 41:58.974
Meaning what?

41:59.433 --> 42:02.019
You don't determine my witness list. I do.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.066
That's beautiful. That's choice.

42:09.318 --> 42:13.364
Listen to what this guy has done to you.
You know what you sound like, Andy?

42:13.489 --> 42:15.199
No. Why don't you educate me?

42:15.866 --> 42:17.868
You advanced so much farther in school.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.037
You sound like you used to when you drank.

42:20.287 --> 42:23.082
-Well, I'm not drinking.
-And I don't want you to.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.418
And I don't need you
on the stand tomorrow.

42:26.502 --> 42:29.505
I don't want this Sinclair thinking
he can turn me into a pretzel.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.215
Then don't let him do it.

42:31.423 --> 42:34.552
Big vulture smile like my collar's dirty
and I tracked in mud.

42:34.927 --> 42:39.473
"One word, who I am,
why I got you terrified."

42:39.723 --> 42:41.016
(CUTLERY CLATTERING)

42:41.350 --> 42:43.727
Andy, Sinclair is a good lawyer
with a rich client

42:43.811 --> 42:47.273
who will lose this hearing
unless he can push your buttons.

42:47.439 --> 42:49.066
Why in the world would you let him?

42:49.149 --> 42:52.528
-I am not terrified.
-Then you don't have to prove it, right?

42:53.445 --> 42:54.446
(SIGHS)

42:56.282 --> 42:59.243
He'll call me for the defense.
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

43:02.830 --> 43:04.748
One way or another,
I'm getting on that stand.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.167
I'll call you.

43:11.088 --> 43:13.215
I'll call you, Andy. Testify for me.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.553
I won't let him get to me.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.016
Will you let me help you through it?

43:22.141 --> 43:24.435
-Absolutely. Absolutely.
-Okay.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.649
I promise I won't embarrass you.

43:34.403 --> 43:35.446
Okay, Andy.
