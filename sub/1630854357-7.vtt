00:07.215 --> 00:08.133
Robert Berchtold,
you're hereby ordered

00:08.174 --> 00:09.134
to serve 15 days.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.510
15 days?

00:10.552 --> 00:12.679
The very first time
I laid eyes on you,

00:12.721 --> 00:14.472
I was transfixed.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.349
Now I don't think I could live
without your special light.

00:16.391 --> 00:20.103
He is a deeply
wicked man, Jani.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.022
You're the ones
who are tormenting me.

00:22.063 --> 00:24.065
And I'm not a child!

00:24.107 --> 00:25.650
I'd like to invite anyone

00:25.692 --> 00:28.028
who wishes
to bear their testimony.

00:28.069 --> 00:31.281
Even if you bring her back,
she's just gonna leave again.

00:31.322 --> 00:33.700
<i>I'll check
with his parole officer,</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:35.618
<i>but he wants
to make it seem like</i>

00:35.660 --> 00:37.287
<i>she left of her own volition.</i>

00:37.328 --> 00:39.122
<i>You are a monster,</i>

00:39.164 --> 00:42.542
a heartless,
vile excuse of a man,

00:42.584 --> 00:44.544
and I will get my daughter
away from you

00:44.586 --> 00:47.756
if it is the last thing
I do on this Earth!

00:52.344 --> 00:53.803
<i>Where are you, B?</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:56.181
<i>Is Jan with you?</i>

00:56.222 --> 00:58.183
<i>No. No.</i>

00:58.224 --> 00:59.392
<i>No, Mary Ann.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.354
<i>No, she called,
said she ran away.</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.357
<i>Oh, I've been drinking
myself sick all morning.</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.927
Hey, angel, hi.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.261
Follow my instructions?

01:35.303 --> 01:36.763
You leave a note
like I told you to?

01:36.805 --> 01:37.889
Mm-hmm.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.934
Okay, good, good.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.811
Hey, hey.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.937
It's all right.

01:43.978 --> 01:45.772
You're okay.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.483
All right?

01:49.234 --> 01:50.902
Okay.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.654
Here.

01:54.155 --> 01:57.283
Take one of these

01:57.325 --> 01:59.661
just for the jitters.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.583
Now...

02:05.625 --> 02:07.460
After I drop you
at the airport,

02:07.502 --> 02:09.212
you do exactly
like I told you to.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.964
Okay?

02:11.006 --> 02:14.384
My friends are gonna meet you
to pick you up when you land.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.308
You look beautiful.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.106
I'll try to come
out as soon as I can

02:28.148 --> 02:30.734
so we can spend a little time
together before school starts.

02:30.775 --> 02:31.776
All right?

02:33.653 --> 02:34.738
All right.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.157
Now you close your eyes,
get some rest.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.909
Got a long trip ahead of you.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.737
Mary Ann?

03:18.073 --> 03:20.700
Mary Ann.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.498
The FBI can't treat this
as a kidnapping either,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.541
not with the note.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.169
As far as the Bureau
is concerned,

03:31.211 --> 03:33.129
Jan is a runaway.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.340
I've been told to stand down

03:35.382 --> 03:37.884
unless we find
incriminating evidence.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.928
But until then,
my hands are tied.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.429
I'm sorry.

03:43.598 --> 03:45.350
This is all my fault.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.773
It's easy to blame
yourselves right now.

03:53.149 --> 03:56.194
No one thinks that
their best friend is a monster.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.534
I'll do my best to keep
track of Berchtold,

04:02.575 --> 04:06.204
but the best plan is
to make him comfortable enough

04:06.246 --> 04:08.998
to contact you
and make a mistake.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.585
If you can get him on tape
incriminating himself,

04:12.627 --> 04:15.088
then I can help you.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.924
You go along with the idea
that Jan ran away,

04:17.966 --> 04:19.676
at least to him.

04:19.718 --> 04:22.262
To anybody else, you can
tell whatever story you want.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.264
But don't accuse him.

04:24.305 --> 04:28.643
He is your only link
to Jan right now.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.814
You need to get him talking
and let him lead us to her.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.663
Hello, Brobergs.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.832
<i>Hi, Mary Ann.
How are you?</i>

04:53.752 --> 04:55.462
Well...

04:59.424 --> 05:00.925
Not good.

05:00.967 --> 05:04.804
<i>Oh, that, uh, husband
of yours around?</i>

05:04.846 --> 05:06.931
He's working late
at the store.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.975
Well, I don't know
if you heard,

05:09.017 --> 05:12.979
but Gail and I are done,
really and truly over.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.773
And, uh...

05:14.814 --> 05:18.651
and I got a place of my own
here in Salt Lake City.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.487
<i>It's not much,
but you know me--</i>

05:20.528 --> 05:23.907
You need to tell me
where Jan is right now.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.658
<i>Well, it's funny
you say that.</i>

05:25.700 --> 05:27.744
<i>I just got through
talking to Jan.</i>

05:27.786 --> 05:30.497
You did?
What'd she say?

05:32.332 --> 05:35.043
<i>B, please.</i>

05:37.212 --> 05:39.506
She said she met two girls,

05:39.547 --> 05:41.883
two older girls,
out hitchhiking.

05:41.925 --> 05:46.888
<i>And they've been doing heaven
knows what out on the road.</i>

05:46.930 --> 05:48.682
<i>I said, "Jan, where are you?</i>

05:48.723 --> 05:51.434
You got everybody
worried sick."

05:52.602 --> 05:55.063
And she wouldn't tell me
where she was.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.107
<i>Oh, she's just so mad
at you and Bob.</i>

05:57.148 --> 05:58.858
<i>She does not want
to come back</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:00.694
<i>and be a child
in your home anymore.</i>

06:00.735 --> 06:02.696
She wants to be
a grown adult?

06:02.737 --> 06:05.490
<i>Oh, Christ,
she is right now.</i>

06:05.532 --> 06:07.450
She's 14.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.871
It is pure hell, Mary Ann,
not knowing where she is.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.459
Oh, and just thinking
about all the awful things

06:16.501 --> 06:19.754
that might be happening
to her out there.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.172
<i>You know, I said to her--
Mary Ann, I said,</i>

06:21.214 --> 06:24.676
<i>"Jan, is there any way
that you'll come back?"</i>

06:24.718 --> 06:26.386
<i>And she said, "I told them</i>

06:26.428 --> 06:30.640
<i>I want to marry you more than
anything else in this world."</i>

06:30.682 --> 06:33.226
<i>I said, "Jan,
would you settle for if we</i>

06:33.268 --> 06:34.769
<i>"kept it very, very quiet,</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:36.855
<i>"and we went down
to the justice of the peace,</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:39.816
<i>and nobody knew, and you
could still live at home?"</i>

06:39.858 --> 06:42.652
<i>And she said, "Oh, B,</i>

06:42.694 --> 06:45.071
<i>do you think there's a chance
they'd let me?"</i>

06:47.115 --> 06:50.076
You are an evil man!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.828
Evil!

06:51.870 --> 06:53.955
I'm glad you're going to jail.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.101
Damn him!

07:16.770 --> 07:19.647
Just couldn't listen
to that for another second.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.080
Ah--pshh. Come on.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.007
Hey, friend.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.342
There something
I can help you with?

08:29.384 --> 08:30.760
Sure.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.096
Where's Jan Broberg?

08:36.057 --> 08:39.269
You know, I thought the FBI
didn't investigate runaways.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.690
Some people might say
this is harassment.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.487
Enjoy your vacation, Berchtold.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.782
Starts today.
Doesn't it?

08:52.824 --> 08:55.535
Yeah. Yeah.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.996
15 days in the pokey.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.124
Might have enough time
to read a book or two.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.919
Well, you take care,
Agent Welsh.

09:07.422 --> 09:09.174
Don't wanna be late.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.911
<i>Pocatello will continue
to be sweltering.</i>

09:37.952 --> 09:39.954
<i>Despite intermittent
cloud cover,</i>

09:39.996 --> 09:41.706
<i>it will again be in the 90s.</i>

10:17.242 --> 10:18.910
Hello, Gail.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.167
I heard the divorce
went through.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.715
May I come in?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.883
Yes, of course.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.732
What brings you by?

10:48.773 --> 10:54.362
Um, I finished dropping
Bob off at jail.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.489
Oh.

10:56.531 --> 10:59.617
And I wanted to

10:59.659 --> 11:02.579
come express my grief

11:02.620 --> 11:05.206
that Jan has run away again.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.334
It must be so hard
for you and Bob.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.128
Thank you.

11:13.965 --> 11:17.552
Of course,
if you knew something,

11:17.594 --> 11:21.681
anything that would give us
a clue where she is,

11:21.723 --> 11:23.892
you would tell us, right?

11:26.728 --> 11:29.105
I did ask him about it.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.024
I looked him dead in the eye,

11:31.066 --> 11:35.695
and he told me that he didn't
have anything to do

11:35.737 --> 11:38.698
with Jan running off this time,

11:38.740 --> 11:40.367
and I believe him.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.035
Gail.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.037
I think Jan truly felt like

11:44.079 --> 11:46.039
she didn't have a choice.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.875
She wants to be
with him that much.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.086
You can't really
believe that.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.299
You know...

11:58.093 --> 12:02.097
I wasn't
that much older than Jan

12:02.138 --> 12:04.099
when Bob and I first met.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.146
If she were my daughter,

12:10.188 --> 12:13.942
I really think I would
just let her marry him.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.236
I guess if it brings her back,

12:16.277 --> 12:17.987
what does it matter
what a piece of paper says?

12:18.029 --> 12:21.032
I see what you're doing,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.244
and I pity you.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.204
And shame on you

12:26.246 --> 12:31.584
for still lying to protect him.

12:36.464 --> 12:38.466
I married him.

12:38.508 --> 12:44.014
And we have four beautiful
children together.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.308
What's your excuse?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.957
You asked for me, sir?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.967
Can you explain to me
why this office

13:21.009 --> 13:22.719
just received
a fresh complaint about you

13:22.761 --> 13:25.180
harassing Robert Berchtold?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.807
Sitting in my own car
is harassment?

13:27.849 --> 13:30.101
What were you doing?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.437
Trying to corroborate
his claim that he wasn't

13:32.479 --> 13:34.731
involved in the second
disappearance of Jan Broberg.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.358
I thought she left a note.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.902
She misspelled
her own mother's name.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.617
Hoofbeats mean horses.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.996
If she left a note saying
she ran away, she ran away.

13:50.038 --> 13:53.541
Stop wasting Bureau resources.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.254
Thank you, sir.

14:07.347 --> 14:11.351
<i>♪ I'm back

<i>♪ Out where

14:15.021 --> 14:17.190
Berchtold, up and at 'em.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.693
It's time to go home.

14:19.734 --> 14:23.196
<i>♪ I'm back

14:23.238 --> 14:26.116

<i>♪ And the only law

14:28.993 --> 14:33.081

<i>Mary Ann,
I heard from Jan again,</i>

14:38.086 --> 14:40.547
<i>and even though
the last time we spoke,</i>

14:40.588 --> 14:42.924
<i>we had some words,
I knew that I had to call you.</i>

14:42.966 --> 14:45.969
I'm glad you did
now that you're out.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.887
Last time we spoke,

14:47.929 --> 14:50.849
I was really upset
about Jan leaving.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.144
<i>Yeah, well,
I figured that's what it was.</i>

14:54.185 --> 14:56.187
Lord knows
I've been upset myself.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.274
I'd probably still be
passed out at some--

14:59.315 --> 15:04.029
some bar if I didn't have
to pay my debt to society.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.032
<i>So how did she sound?</i>

15:07.073 --> 15:11.578
Well, she's still hitchhiking
with those two older girls.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.913
It kills me
to tell you this, Mary Ann,

15:13.955 --> 15:17.959
but she's using heavy drugs.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.880
<i>Heroin, Mary Ann.</i>

15:21.921 --> 15:23.340
Oh.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.426
Oh, dear.

15:26.468 --> 15:29.471
And where was she
calling from?

15:29.512 --> 15:32.724
She didn't say,

15:32.766 --> 15:37.354
but she said, "The only way
that I'll come home

15:37.395 --> 15:40.857
"is if I know that you
and I can be man and wife.

15:40.899 --> 15:44.319
"So ask them again, please,

15:44.361 --> 15:47.655
<i>to sign the papers,
so we can get married."</i>

15:53.620 --> 15:56.790
So that means
she'll be calling back

15:56.831 --> 15:58.625
at some point then, right?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.795
<i>Yes, I suppose so,
to hear your response.</i>

16:05.173 --> 16:08.343
Is it cold where she is?

16:08.385 --> 16:10.720
She didn't bring much with her.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.306
<i>You know, I think she just
really wants to come home.</i>

16:13.348 --> 16:14.974
We'll buy her a plane ticket.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.185
Just tell us what airport.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.771
Or could she take a bus?

16:19.813 --> 16:23.692
Mary Ann, she's barely got
enough change to call me.

16:23.733 --> 16:28.738
I say, "Jan, how are
you getting your money?"

16:28.780 --> 16:31.658
And she says, "Hard."

16:40.208 --> 16:44.754
Are you saying
that you'll send her back

16:44.796 --> 16:47.549
if we let her marry you?

16:49.342 --> 16:52.262
It's not so much
that I want to.

16:56.516 --> 17:01.271
It's that if I had to,
for her sake.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.783
You know I love Jan.

17:15.452 --> 17:20.290
<i>So of course I'd marry her
if that was the only way</i>

17:20.331 --> 17:24.544
<i>to get her to come home
and to know she's safe.</i>

17:26.171 --> 17:27.839
But I guess
I'll find her myself

17:27.881 --> 17:29.841
since you don't give a damn.

17:36.931 --> 17:40.268
Okay, the good news
is that we have him on tape

17:40.310 --> 17:42.687
saying that he
would marry her, right?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.022
I mean,
that's gotta be something

17:44.064 --> 17:45.231
that Pete
can work with, right?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.525
- It's worth a shot.
- Yeah.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.364
You did great.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.788
Well?

18:01.956 --> 18:03.833
I wish it was enough.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.380
He said he would marry her.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.840
Not as a demand.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.141
Brobergs.

18:20.183 --> 18:23.061
Mary Ann,
Bishop Paulson here.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.063
Is Bob with you?

18:25.105 --> 18:27.649
Yes, Bishop.
He's right here.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.528
Bishop, how are you?

18:31.569 --> 18:35.740
Bob, Nicole and I were
coming back from BYU today,

18:35.782 --> 18:38.743
and we were passing
through Ogden.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.830
And I happened
to notice a car going past.

18:41.871 --> 18:47.961
And I am quite sure that it
was Bob Berchtold at the wheel.

18:48.003 --> 18:54.342
And I believe that it was Jan
riding in the car with him.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.973
You saw Jan in the car?

19:00.015 --> 19:02.058
<i>Yeah, I think so.</i>

19:02.100 --> 19:06.187
<i>And you had said she was
staying with her grandmother,</i>

19:06.229 --> 19:09.315
so I thought
that was to put some space

19:09.357 --> 19:12.444
between her
and the Berchtold situation.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.238
<i>So I figured if they were
spending time together,</i>

19:15.280 --> 19:17.115
<i>you'd want to know about that.</i>

19:17.157 --> 19:19.034
Do you know where
they were headed?

19:19.075 --> 19:20.493
Could you tell?

19:20.535 --> 19:22.245
Headed South on I-15.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.372
They're near Ogden,
like I said.

19:24.414 --> 19:27.834
South on I-15.
Thank you, Bishop.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.794
Sure thing.

19:32.130 --> 19:35.050
He's with her.
He's with her.

19:35.091 --> 19:40.138
She's in Ogden.
Our Bishop saw her in his car.

19:40.180 --> 19:42.140
Is she under duress?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.017
Probably, I mean, I don't--

19:44.059 --> 19:46.686
Surely that's enough
for the FBI to get involved?

19:46.728 --> 19:49.189
Yeah.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.192
We need to disprove
she's a runaway.

19:52.233 --> 19:57.238
Contributing in the delinquency
of a minor is a misdemeanor.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.491
To open a federal case,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.868
we need proof
of interstate transport,

20:01.910 --> 20:05.830
travel receipts,
or a ransom demand,

20:05.872 --> 20:07.749
or a confession on tape.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.043
Couldn't you at least
call the police department

20:10.085 --> 20:11.628
in Ogden?

20:11.670 --> 20:14.839
You can't open a case,
but maybe they could

20:14.881 --> 20:17.676
if they thought he was
in the company of a runaway.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.137
I can't.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.722
I'm sorry.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.184
It's not enough for the Bureau.

20:27.102 --> 20:30.105
If I press too hard,
they will cut me loose,

20:30.146 --> 20:33.775
and you'll have no one there
who cares about Jan.

20:36.653 --> 20:41.741
But if the Bishop saw her,
at least we know she's close.

20:43.451 --> 20:45.578
Thanks a lot, Pete.

20:48.665 --> 20:50.250
I'll see myself out.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.482
<i>Sorry I'm late.</i>

21:14.524 --> 21:17.485
Don't worry about
fixing me a plate.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.281
I don't have much
of an appetite,

21:21.322 --> 21:23.199
to be honest with you.

21:23.241 --> 21:26.286
Yeah, I just don't
know what to do.

21:26.327 --> 21:30.915
Well, if you hear anything,
please let us know right away.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.587
Where are the girls?
Are they okay?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.547
- Jenny hasn't come home.
- What?

21:37.589 --> 21:41.009
Where is she?
- I thought she was at Sally's.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.969
I've called everywhere.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.331
Hi.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.041
How was the sleepover?

22:14.459 --> 22:15.752
It was good.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.796
Sally's mother
called your mother

22:17.837 --> 22:21.383
to thank her
for letting Sally sleep here.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.721
Where have you been?

22:26.763 --> 22:29.808
It's not a big deal.
We just went out to see a show.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.602
I've been looking
for you in ditches.

22:34.145 --> 22:37.107
Dad, we're in Idaho.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.736
Go to your room.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.635
<i>Ogden Police Department,
how can I help you?</i>

23:05.677 --> 23:07.846
Peter Welsh, Pocatello FBI.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.222
I'd like to speak
with the ranking officer

23:09.264 --> 23:10.265
on duty please.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.474
<i>Just one moment.</i>

23:13.435 --> 23:15.228
<i>This is Captain Collins.</i>

23:15.270 --> 23:17.480
Hey, Terry, Pete Welsh here.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.899
Listen,
you didn't hear this from me,

23:19.941 --> 23:21.735
but there's a guy down in Ogden

23:21.776 --> 23:24.612
that I think you boys
should know about.

23:40.462 --> 23:43.506
We've been here all day.

23:43.548 --> 23:48.470
Shouldn't we just
go in or something?

23:48.511 --> 23:50.889
I mean, if there's even
a chance that she's in there.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.809
At his known address where
a parole officer could stop by?

23:54.851 --> 23:57.145
No, we stick with the plan.

23:57.187 --> 23:59.898
We wait, then we'll follow.

24:01.608 --> 24:04.194
It's just wearing me down.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.198
The waiting and the guilt.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.629
Mary Ann...

24:24.798 --> 24:28.635
I've forgiven you...

24:28.677 --> 24:30.845
for everything.

24:44.526 --> 24:46.027
That's him.
That's him.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.154
Get down.

24:52.367 --> 24:55.495
There's somebody else
in the car with him.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.080
Is it Jan?

24:57.122 --> 24:58.456
I can't tell.

25:04.087 --> 25:06.047
Come on.

25:13.763 --> 25:16.307
I think it's her.
I think it's her.

25:30.864 --> 25:34.617
So the girl that Bishop Paulson
saw wasn't...

25:36.453 --> 25:38.747
It was
someone else's daughter.

25:59.059 --> 26:01.603

27:08.837 --> 27:11.548
I mean,
it's just their perception

27:11.589 --> 27:13.800
of what reality
and the truth is.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.681
Hmm.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.435
Well, all right,
I sure am glad

27:23.476 --> 27:25.979
that I get to go to boarding
school while we're out here,

27:26.021 --> 27:28.356
while we finish the mission.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.697
I wonder if it'll be weird,
though, being Catholic.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.118
Oh, you're gonna
do just fine.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.620
You're the best actress I know.

27:42.662 --> 27:45.040
You're gonna win
an Oscar one day.

27:48.543 --> 27:52.047
Just hope I can make
friends at Sacred Heart.

27:52.088 --> 27:56.426
I almost miss Karen,
and Susan, and Caroline.

27:56.468 --> 27:58.219
Well, I hate
to disappoint you, Dolly,

27:58.261 --> 27:59.929
but I don't think Zada
and Zethra would want you

27:59.971 --> 28:03.433
making friends,
not with those Catholic girls.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.477
Sacred Heart's just temporary

28:05.518 --> 28:08.313
until Mary Ann and Bob
sign the marriage papers.

28:08.938 --> 28:10.648
To do the mission,
we need to spend

28:10.690 --> 28:12.275
as much time
as possible together

28:12.317 --> 28:14.069
over the next two years
before you turn 16.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.654
The only way that happens
is if they sign those papers.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.407
Everything depends
on those papers.

28:21.201 --> 28:23.203
What's that got
to do with making friends

28:23.244 --> 28:24.662
while I'm there?

28:24.704 --> 28:29.250
We don't want to slip up
and compromise the mission.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.340
You know,
Zada told me something

28:35.382 --> 28:39.469
that I think
might cheer you up.

28:39.511 --> 28:43.807
One of the nuns there
is from their planet,

28:43.848 --> 28:45.475
just like you.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.769
I don't know which one,

28:47.811 --> 28:49.938
but she'll
be watching over you.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.108
Can I talk to her?

28:53.149 --> 28:55.151
Oh, I think
it's probably best not to.

28:55.193 --> 28:59.280
You might talk
to the wrong one, say too much.

28:59.322 --> 29:03.243
And I don't think Zada
and Zethra would like that.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.085
Oh, I almost forgot.

29:12.127 --> 29:14.462
I got one more
surprise for you.

30:00.675 --> 30:02.469
It's a portable TV.

30:02.510 --> 30:05.138
I saw one just like this
in a magazine.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.931
Well, now you can watch
"Bionic Woman"

30:06.973 --> 30:08.808
and "Charlie's Angels"
and all that.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.143
But you got
to keep it a secret.

30:10.185 --> 30:11.770
No TVs allowed at school.

30:11.811 --> 30:14.147
Thank you.

30:16.358 --> 30:20.070
Watch it when you're lonely
and think of me,

30:20.111 --> 30:22.530
the Six Million Dollar Man.

30:22.572 --> 30:24.991
You know, I met Lee Majors
about two years

30:25.033 --> 30:26.493
before that show came out.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.286
And I told him I had
an idea for a program

30:28.328 --> 30:30.455
about an astronaut
who gets injured.

30:30.497 --> 30:32.999
And then I turn on the TV,
and I see that show,

30:33.041 --> 30:35.669
and I think, gosh darn it.

30:35.710 --> 30:38.129
That's my idea.

30:38.171 --> 30:40.173
I wouldn't want to be
out here in Hollywood

30:40.215 --> 30:41.966
with all those "pinkos"
anyways.

31:14.499 --> 31:19.045
Her mother passed tragically
when we were escaping the PLO.

31:19.087 --> 31:22.132
I find it best not
to speak to her about it.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.052
You know, luckily, Jerry has--

31:26.094 --> 31:28.263
Sorry.

31:28.304 --> 31:30.223
It's a force of habit.

31:30.265 --> 31:33.309
President Ford
has been so supportive.

31:34.602 --> 31:36.396
We're proud
to support the work you do

31:36.438 --> 31:39.232
for the White House in
any way we can, Mr. Tobler.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.192
Well, thank you, sisters.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.361
I'm sure
she'll be just fine here.

31:46.406 --> 31:49.034
You know, the CIA
investigated your school.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.036
So I know just about everything
there is to know

31:51.077 --> 31:52.662
about Flintridge Sacred Heart.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.461
Would you excuse me?

32:15.310 --> 32:18.188
Remember
what I told you, Dolly.

32:18.229 --> 32:23.193
One of them will be
watching over you.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.653
Got it?

32:28.531 --> 32:30.158
Okay.

32:32.827 --> 32:34.788
Come here.

32:54.974 --> 32:56.810
You take care of my Janis now.

32:56.851 --> 32:59.062

<i>Martians, flying saucers.</i>

34:39.371 --> 34:41.247
<i>I know
this is gonna sound crazy,</i>

34:41.289 --> 34:43.750
<i>but there was
something out there.</i>

34:43.792 --> 34:46.544
<i>I saw it.
- You saw it?</i>

34:46.586 --> 34:49.255
<i>Come on, Oscar.
What'd you see?</i>

34:49.297 --> 34:51.007
<i>A flying saucer.</i>

34:51.049 --> 34:52.967
<i>Everything that these people
are saying is true.</i>

34:53.009 --> 34:56.262
<i>A great big flying saucer.
- Really?</i>

34:56.304 --> 34:57.597
<i>Wait, wait, what
about Bill Robinson?</i>

34:57.639 --> 34:59.766
<i>He's a UFO expert.
Did he see it too?</i>

34:59.808 --> 35:01.267
<i>He hasn't got the
faintest idea about it,</i>

35:01.309 --> 35:02.644
<i>but it was there.</i>

35:02.686 --> 35:04.312
<i>It flew over them
and then disappeared.</i>

35:04.354 --> 35:06.106
<i>Disappeared?</i>

35:06.147 --> 35:09.401
<i>Yes, it was a beam, a light.</i>

35:19.452 --> 35:22.789
And they just ride horses
all day.

35:26.876 --> 35:30.422
- So jealous.
- I don't even understand.

35:37.929 --> 35:39.639
Well, hey, new girl.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.099
You don't need
to look so nervous.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.977
We don't bite.
What's your name?

35:44.019 --> 35:46.771
Janis. Janis Tobler.

35:46.813 --> 35:49.566
Well, where are you from,
Janis Tobler?

35:51.526 --> 35:55.321
Um, well, before here,
my dad and I were in Lebanon.

35:55.363 --> 35:57.282
Are there
any cute guys there?

36:01.286 --> 36:03.705
I don't really like
to talk about it.

36:05.415 --> 36:07.667
Okay.
Suit yourself.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.003
Did you know
Melissa Sue Anderson

36:10.045 --> 36:13.423
from "Little House
on the Prairie" goes here?

36:13.465 --> 36:16.968
Anyway, next weekend,
there's going to be a pool.

36:17.010 --> 36:20.263
So that means bring
your bathing suits.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.244
Oh, Janis, come in.

36:51.419 --> 36:53.797
Have a seat.

37:05.433 --> 37:08.478
What can I help you with?

37:12.607 --> 37:14.943
I just wanted
to ask about something.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.406
What is it?

37:19.447 --> 37:22.367
Ask anything you like.

37:28.748 --> 37:30.709
Are you...

37:35.964 --> 37:39.175
Are you...

37:39.217 --> 37:41.469
like me?

37:47.934 --> 37:50.437
I'm not sure what
you mean, Janis.

37:54.649 --> 37:57.569
Are you sure you're all right?

37:57.610 --> 37:59.070
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry.

37:59.112 --> 38:00.739
I just don't think
that I'm feeling very--

38:00.780 --> 38:02.365
Janis.

38:04.242 --> 38:05.994
I know what this is about.

38:14.294 --> 38:16.671
You miss your mother,
don't you?

38:23.136 --> 38:25.805
Losing a parent is hard.

38:27.057 --> 38:29.976
There's nothing wrong
with being sad about it.

38:32.228 --> 38:36.733
But you can always turn
to the Lord for comfort.

38:38.568 --> 38:41.988
And don't forget.
You still have your father.

38:44.074 --> 38:47.702
You're lucky to have him
watching over you.

38:54.292 --> 38:56.753
Yeah.

38:57.796 --> 38:59.839
I am.

39:23.029 --> 39:25.782
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:33.498 --> 39:35.291
I sure am glad
you came to visit,

39:35.333 --> 39:36.835
even if it's just
for the weekend.

39:36.876 --> 39:39.421
You're the only person
I can really talk to.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.674
You been doing like we
talked about,

39:42.716 --> 39:45.093
staying focused on the mission?

39:45.135 --> 39:47.387
Yeah, of course.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.431
That's my girl.

39:56.146 --> 39:57.856
Oh.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.402
Here.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.487
There's something I've been
itching to share with you.

40:04.529 --> 40:06.781
It's a little
something I wrote.

40:06.823 --> 40:09.617
And then I want you
to write something.

40:10.702 --> 40:12.704
Write what?

40:12.746 --> 40:14.122
Just a few words
from the heart.

40:14.164 --> 40:15.206
We'll get there.

40:15.248 --> 40:17.584
First...

40:17.625 --> 40:20.295
this is from
a little something I call

40:20.337 --> 40:22.422
"A Season in the Sun."

40:22.464 --> 40:24.966
It's sort of a memoir.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.427
What's that?

40:27.469 --> 40:29.804
Oh, that's where
you write down

40:29.846 --> 40:32.849
your memories from the best
parts of your life in a book.

40:32.891 --> 40:36.269
So this one's all
about you, Dolly.

40:36.311 --> 40:39.022
There's quite
a few publishers interested,

40:39.064 --> 40:43.485
and even talk
of $1/4 million advance.

40:43.526 --> 40:45.820
We'll see.
- Wow.

40:49.741 --> 40:52.202
"Even as Mary Ann and Bob

40:52.243 --> 40:56.414
"try to keep us apart
out of jealousy and spite,

40:56.456 --> 40:57.999
"the only thing
I can hang on to

40:58.041 --> 41:01.002
"through this whole mess
is Jan's love.

41:01.044 --> 41:05.465
"I know with all my soul
that I would die for her.

41:05.507 --> 41:07.384
More important than that..."

41:07.425 --> 41:09.344
<i>He's willing to live</i>

41:09.386 --> 41:13.723
<i>and endure everything
you can throw upon him.</i>

41:13.765 --> 41:17.936
<i>He'd go through it all
for me and so much more,</i>

41:17.977 --> 41:20.438
<i>more than you can
ever imagine,</i>

41:20.480 --> 41:24.359
<i>with all your hang-ups
and old-fashioned ways.</i>

41:24.401 --> 41:27.696
<i>We have a special connection,
the two of us.</i>

41:29.864 --> 41:32.867
<i>I left home
because I was sick to death</i>

41:32.909 --> 41:35.787
<i>of putting on
the little girl act</i>

41:35.829 --> 41:39.249
<i>just because it's what
everyone expected of me.</i>

41:39.290 --> 41:41.751
<i>I've had all I could take
of the battle</i>

41:41.793 --> 41:44.671
<i>between you and me over B.</i>

41:44.713 --> 41:47.048
<i>He had been mine
from the beginning,</i>

41:47.090 --> 41:50.468
<i>and you had no right to him.</i>

41:50.510 --> 41:55.098
<i>Most of all, on this Earth,
I want to be B's wife.</i>

41:55.140 --> 41:58.685
<i>And I know our love
will go on into eternity,</i>

41:58.727 --> 42:03.106
<i>no matter what you, or Bob,
or anyone else on this Earth</i>

42:03.148 --> 42:05.483
<i>does to us.</i>

42:05.525 --> 42:09.571
"I would like very much
to start a new relationship

42:09.612 --> 42:13.366
"with you
on a woman-to-woman basis.

42:13.408 --> 42:18.621
Maybe then we'd learn
to enjoy each other."

42:19.998 --> 42:23.209
"Please do whatever
needs to be done

42:23.251 --> 42:26.588
so that I can return
and marry B."

42:28.298 --> 42:30.216
"Love, Jan."

42:47.484 --> 42:49.611
Morning.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.907
Hey, Greg.

42:53.948 --> 42:55.909
Did you have a chance
to track down that psychologist

42:55.950 --> 42:58.286
from the Broberg case,
the one that came by

42:58.328 --> 43:00.789
the first time he took her,
Dr. Milstein?

43:00.830 --> 43:02.916
Yeah, that clinic
closed over a year ago.

43:02.957 --> 43:04.751
And the last former employee
I spoke with said

43:04.793 --> 43:06.294
that Dr. Milstein's
on a sabbatical

43:06.336 --> 43:08.922
somewhere in Argentina.

43:08.963 --> 43:11.299
If we could locate him,
that would help establish

43:11.341 --> 43:12.967
a pattern of behavior.

43:13.009 --> 43:15.470
Berchtold is going
to do this with other kids.

43:15.512 --> 43:17.013
He's not gonna stop.

43:17.055 --> 43:19.432
You know, listen, I think
this LDS Social Services

43:19.474 --> 43:20.684
in the Mormon church--

43:20.725 --> 43:22.102
they had access
to Berchtold's files,

43:22.143 --> 43:23.687
since they're the ones
that referred him.

43:23.728 --> 43:25.021
So we should talk to them too.

43:25.063 --> 43:28.858
Pete, Pete, Pete,
what are you talking about?

43:28.900 --> 43:30.944
I'm not gonna do any of this.

43:34.823 --> 43:37.534
I know you've gotten
close to these people.

43:37.575 --> 43:40.870
But I'd like to go out
in the Bureau's good graces.

43:40.912 --> 43:42.956
So I'm gonna follow
Flynn's direct order

43:42.997 --> 43:45.333
not to work
on the Broberg case.

43:48.878 --> 43:51.172
And you should too.

44:11.651 --> 44:13.695
He's right in there.

44:13.737 --> 44:16.281
Thank you.

44:16.322 --> 44:19.367
Bishop Paulson,
Agent Peter Welsh, FBI.

44:19.409 --> 44:20.910
Is this a good time?

44:20.952 --> 44:22.746
Agent Welsh, come in.

44:25.540 --> 44:28.043
Really appreciate you
taking the time to see me.

44:29.544 --> 44:31.755
Not at all.

44:31.796 --> 44:34.758
Have a seat.

44:38.386 --> 44:41.890
Oh, honey,
you want to wait downstairs?

44:41.931 --> 44:43.767
We shouldn't be too long.

44:44.976 --> 44:47.854
Ever since she's in college,
I gotta steal

44:47.896 --> 44:50.857
whatever father-daughter time
I can get.

44:50.899 --> 44:52.484
Well, I'm just
checking to see

44:52.525 --> 44:56.321
if we missed anything
from our initial investigation.

44:59.699 --> 45:05.205
The LDS Social Services
is mentioned several times.

45:05.246 --> 45:07.582
Can you explain
to me what that is?

45:07.624 --> 45:11.836
Mm-hmm, that's a nonprofit
operated by the LDS church

45:11.878 --> 45:15.674
that provides counseling
for members in need.

45:15.715 --> 45:19.219
Mm-hmm, and why was Berchtold
seeking counseling?

45:19.260 --> 45:23.390
No, he was referred by me,
his Bishop.

45:23.431 --> 45:27.394
Oh, that must have
been summer of '74.

45:27.435 --> 45:31.398
But Jan wasn't taken
until October that year.

45:31.439 --> 45:33.650
So why refer him?

45:33.692 --> 45:39.406
Well,
Bob Berchtold actually--

45:40.824 --> 45:44.202
He had made
inappropriate overtures

45:44.244 --> 45:47.747
toward my daughter, Nicole.

45:47.789 --> 45:50.000
To your daughter?

45:50.041 --> 45:52.210
How old was she at the time?

45:52.252 --> 45:56.006
At that time, she was 14.

45:56.047 --> 46:01.094
And he was a member
of the High Council.

46:01.136 --> 46:02.971
The High Council?

46:03.013 --> 46:04.639
The High Council--

46:04.681 --> 46:09.477
it sounds high and mighty,
but we're a lay clergy.

46:09.519 --> 46:13.189
So members of the church
were called on to volunteer.

46:13.231 --> 46:15.942
I've been
a Sunday school teacher,

46:15.984 --> 46:21.614
scout leader, high councilman,
and now, Bishop.

46:21.656 --> 46:24.117
So, yes, Bob...

46:24.159 --> 46:27.871
Bob Berchtold was
on the High Council.

46:27.912 --> 46:34.127
But then when we learned
that his condition

46:34.169 --> 46:38.256
had gotten worse,
he was excommunicated

46:38.298 --> 46:43.636
and referred
to LDS Social Services.

46:43.678 --> 46:47.182
What do you mean,
his condition had gotten worse?

46:49.517 --> 46:53.146
Disciplinary matters
before the Council--

46:53.188 --> 46:57.484
they're supposed to be
confidential, Agent Welsh.

46:57.525 --> 46:59.361
Mm.

47:04.657 --> 47:06.868
How about first I tell you

47:06.910 --> 47:10.163
what I know
about Robert Berchtold?

47:11.581 --> 47:16.086
I know he doesn't feel emotions
the way that we do.

47:16.127 --> 47:20.590
I know that he will lie,
manipulate, intimidate,

47:20.632 --> 47:24.344
and blackmail to get
the only thing that he wants,

47:24.386 --> 47:26.846
which is access to young girls.

47:26.888 --> 47:31.393
And I know that he is doing it
right now as we speak.

47:34.062 --> 47:35.855
So, Bishop,
if you know anything

47:35.897 --> 47:38.525
that might help us stop him,

47:38.566 --> 47:40.735
it is incumbent
on your conscience

47:40.777 --> 47:45.115
and on your soul to share
that with me right now.

47:49.869 --> 47:54.290
Well...

47:55.959 --> 47:57.919
Excuse me.

48:00.630 --> 48:04.634
The reason
that he was excommunicated

48:04.676 --> 48:06.970
was because he told us

48:07.012 --> 48:12.100
that he had drugged Jan Broberg

48:12.142 --> 48:15.395
on multiple occasions

48:15.437 --> 48:18.732
and acted out

48:18.773 --> 48:23.486
sexual fantasies,

48:23.528 --> 48:28.241
masturbation and...

48:28.283 --> 48:31.870
limited, uh, intercourse

48:31.911 --> 48:34.497
while she slept.

48:48.803 --> 48:51.181
Before the first kidnapping?

48:53.516 --> 48:57.270
Did anyone tell
law enforcement?

48:57.312 --> 49:00.231
Did anyone tell the Brobergs?

49:05.653 --> 49:11.284
Agent, our religion,

49:11.326 --> 49:13.787
it is built upon the pillars

49:13.828 --> 49:18.541
of faith and repentance.

49:18.583 --> 49:20.460
Okay.

49:20.502 --> 49:25.507
We believe that
Jesus Christ is our Savior,

49:25.548 --> 49:29.969
and he died
and paid for our sins.

49:30.011 --> 49:34.349
If we repent...

49:36.142 --> 49:39.771
He forgives us.

49:39.813 --> 49:44.067
Our main teaching is to try

49:44.109 --> 49:48.363
to become like him.

49:55.578 --> 49:59.040
He's been doing this
for years.

50:02.043 --> 50:04.337
You could have stopped it.

50:08.717 --> 50:11.386
He had repented, and...

50:21.730 --> 50:24.649
I thought
I was doing the right thing.
