Hey, Omar.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.633
No, Jimmy... stop it!

00:38.139 --> 00:41.775
It's okay, Omar. Go ahead, take

00:46.714 --> 00:48.249
Go on.

00:48.282 --> 00:52.620
Jimmy has
re-centered himself,
right?

00:58.726 --> 01:01.195
-Jimmy, you have
a right to be upset.

01:01.229 --> 01:07.101
But you do not have a right to
physicaly abuse another
individual.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.536
Yes, ma'am.

01:08.969 --> 01:12.540
Omar, would you like to tell us
why you are here?

01:12.573 --> 01:15.543
Ah I'm-- I'm here because a

01:16.210 --> 01:20.181
I got into it with a couple
people goin'
back and forth.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.182
it's nothin' major.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.452
- Does it sound like Omar's
taking full responsibility
guys?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.454
- [scoffs] No.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.988
Try it again, Omar.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.192
This time, could you recognize

01:31.225 --> 01:35.263
and express what you could have
done differently.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.535
I lost my cool at my son's
basketball game.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.139
- I yelled at a couple--
-Verbally abused!

01:45.173 --> 01:47.475

knock any of 'em
out?

01:56.083 --> 01:57.117
No.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.587
- You didn't push somebody's
head into the wall?

I'm Rachel Bailey. I'm the
leasing agent for this property.

03:37.785 --> 03:41.188
Oh um... yeah, I was just doing
some window shopping. A

03:41.622 --> 03:42.823
it's a cool space.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.359
Yeah. 3800 square feet. Only
been on the market for 2 months.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.660
I'm sure it'll go fast.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.861
How much is it?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.430
Four dollars and 50 cents.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.399
[smirks] What, am I being
punked?

03:51.799 --> 03:54.201
I can pay that right now. Why is
it so cheap?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.135
Per square foot.

Oh. [chuckles]

03:57.671 --> 03:58.872
Never mind.

could kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

phone,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.234
there is so much you can do with
this space.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.070
Ah if you don't mind me asking,
what would you use this space
for?

04:30.103 --> 04:31.839
Oh we use it to make my movies.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.842
Oh, that's exciting. What kind
of movies?

04:35.543 --> 04:36.844
Adult movies.

[sighs] 3 years is a little
tough for me. I was really
hoping

04:58.231 --> 05:00.534
for like um 3 months.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.437
- [snickers]
- I'm sorry. We don't do
short-term leasing.

- Okay, um I'm so sorry. Thank
you so much for your time,
Rachel.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.947
just gonna run out and get it
and I'll

05:13.981 --> 05:15.248
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.050
- Okay.
- Alright, I'll just do some
measurements.

accept and process his
application but

05:31.499 --> 05:33.233
maybe you can fill one out as
well?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.969
And I can talk to the owner
about a short-term lease.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.205
Okay, sure. Yeah, that would be
great!

05:38.238 --> 05:39.907
Ah I can't make any promises but

05:39.940 --> 05:41.108
it's worth a shot, right?

05:41.141 --> 05:43.944
Of course. Yeah, um [laughs]

05:44.277 --> 05:45.145
thank you.

That's correct.

05:56.323 --> 05:57.891
How's that goin' for ya?

05:57.925 --> 06:01.595
Well, I just relocated the
company 6 months ago when I
moved back

06:01.629 --> 06:03.163
to Atlanta from Connecticut.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.932
So it's got it's growin' pains.

06:04.965 --> 06:05.833
- Yeah...

06:06.834 --> 06:09.002
and my father ran our company
into the ground.

06:09.470 --> 06:12.940
It was only worth 5 million when
he finally passed it down.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.944
Today we're operating a half
billion in assets.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.712
So I know your struggle.

06:20.347 --> 06:22.750
Sounds like you had to build
things from the ground up.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.018
- Yep, and we wanna give

06:25.052 --> 06:27.020
people like you an opportunity.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.022
- People like me?

06:29.056 --> 06:30.223
[laughs]

06:30.858 --> 06:32.192
I'm listenin'.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.529
We have a 100 million in
capital.

those funds.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.305
Yeah, I'm sorry.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.708
I'm just not interested in a
working for someone.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.543
I got employees dependin' on me.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.179
- We're not interested in hiring
you.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.816
This is more of a consulting
fee, to advise on potential
property options.

06:55.849 --> 06:56.850
Huh.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.052
It's a great opportunity.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.354
Why me?

In addition to Kevin boasting
about how bright

if that's okay.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.037
Sure, no pressure.

- Alright.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.873
Just, let us know ASAP so

07:19.907 --> 07:21.742
a little bit of pressure

We are prepared to offer 50K in
advance if that helps expedite

07:25.579 --> 07:26.614
your decision.

07:27.414 --> 07:28.749
It just might.

07:39.893 --> 07:44.031
And the requirement for the
duration of the class is what?

07:44.064 --> 07:45.666
- No, no alcohol
- No alcohol.

07:45.699 --> 07:48.435
- That's right. No alcohol.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.779
Ah, is there anything I need to
sign?

08:00.313 --> 08:02.282
- Ah...what do you mean?

08:03.416 --> 08:07.320
Well a court order / probation
officer form for your
attendance?

08:07.721 --> 08:09.990
Oh, no. No, I'm here on my own.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.861
Is that surprising?

08:13.894 --> 08:18.732
Well I mean it's rare that a
Black um African-American

08:18.766 --> 08:20.467
- ...look--
- No, you-- you can say Black.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.403
Okay, I don't want to be
offensive or anything like that.

Black!

Okay...

08:30.077 --> 08:31.411
a Black man!

08:31.444 --> 08:34.181
Oh, oh okay. You don't have to
say it that hard.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.483
Ah ah ah [stammering]

08:36.516 --> 08:37.484
Just kidding.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.620
[deep sigh]

08:39.653 --> 08:43.891
No I mean truly, it's rare that
a Black man would be here on his
own accord.

08:43.924 --> 08:47.595
The stigma of mental health in
the Black community is real.

08:47.628 --> 08:51.732
Yeah... my cousin has special
needs and um

08:51.765 --> 08:55.135
[clicks tongue] y'all leave that
boy alone. He a little touched.

08:55.168 --> 08:59.172
- Oh... yo-- yo mama had a
touch.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.474
Quick little piece of advice,
Miss Jane...

09:02.142 --> 09:04.277
don't ever talk about a Black
man's mama.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.446
Oah, no, no, no, never.

09:06.479 --> 09:10.183
I'm just saying I don't think
they should be left alone. I
think we should deal with them.

09:10.483 --> 09:11.819
Black people...

09:12.686 --> 09:17.257
acknowledge and seek out mental
health at a fraction of the rate

09:17.290 --> 09:21.094
of whites, with all the trauma
of systemic racism.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.598
And a lot of Black people seek
out the church

09:24.632 --> 09:27.167
rather than a medical
professional.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.138
Damn, you... you really know
your stuff, Miss Jane.

09:31.171 --> 09:35.508
[laughs] I hope so. I've been
doing it for over 40 years.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.510
Oh, quick question.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.714
Is there really no alcohol?

09:40.748 --> 09:44.451
[laughs] It helps to come with a
clear mind.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.955
Some people can't handle it, so
we make it a rule

09:47.988 --> 09:49.923
across the board.

09:50.323 --> 09:52.125
Got it.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.426
See you next week?

09:55.028 --> 09:56.664
I'll try to see what I can do.

court order.

minute.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.496
- Mm hm.
- You workin' late?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.734
Yeah, we're implementing new
policies in HR and

11:06.767 --> 11:09.402
guess who's entirely responsible
for all of it?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.604
- [Jarvis laughs] Uh huh.
- Yeah, mm hm.

11:11.939 --> 11:15.542
Hey, um I'm really happy that
your meeting went well today.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.377
You know I think it's a really
good opportunity.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.647
Yeah but somethin' still bothers
me about it.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.315
What? Like what?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.918
Well, Bill asked me two
questions

11:24.952 --> 11:26.453
that bothered me.

11:26.486 --> 11:30.323
Offers me a check for 50,000
because he wants to give us a
chance.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.492
I don't like handouts. You know
that.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.829
Mm hm, but I mean you put in the
hard work.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.630
You planted the seeds and

11:37.664 --> 11:39.499
now you get to reap the rewards.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.501
Plus he knows your value.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.503
Mm... mm hm.

- Mm.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.577
Good night. Enjoy babe. I will
just be upstairs

11:50.610 --> 11:51.745

do it though.

- Technically I'm not supposed
to be drinkin'.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
What, are you on a cleanse or
somethin'?

12:10.530 --> 12:14.034
No, it's a requirement from my
anger management therapist.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.103
- Oh! So you went?
- Oh.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.437
How was it?

12:17.470 --> 12:19.172
It was like goin' to scared
straight.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.373
[Jarvis laughs]

12:20.407 --> 12:22.275
Well that sounds
counterproductive but

12:22.309 --> 12:24.344
I mean, you know you're doin' it
for Caleb, right?

12:24.377 --> 12:25.312
Yeah, I am...

12:25.345 --> 12:27.547
but I can see the value in it
too.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.817
- Hm.
- Leh, listen...if you want,

12:29.850 --> 12:31.985
yeah I can get you some apple
juice in a sippy cup or
somethin'.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.021

Would you like one of those?

12:40.527 --> 12:41.628

- You got jokes?

12:41.661 --> 12:43.496
- No, it's okay.
- Someone needs a nap.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.764

- Okay.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.318
For Ari?

13:05.352 --> 13:07.921
I'm guessin' you didn't check
the driver's profile.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.690
Gregory?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.327
What the hell? Is this some kind
of joke?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.529
Tsh, I was thinkin' the same
thing.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.098
I'm still waitin' for the punch
line.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.033
[laughter]

13:20.067 --> 13:21.201
- Mm.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.070
I was gonna cancel the trip.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.838
Why would you do that?

13:24.872 --> 13:25.973
Uh...

13:26.006 --> 13:28.041
I mean pickin' up my ex in an
Uber isn't necessarily

13:28.075 --> 13:30.110
one of my greatest achievements.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.278
Mm.

13:31.544 --> 13:32.946
Well...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.148
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.718
I mean... if you became a rapper

13:38.751 --> 13:41.121
and were sellin' mix tapes at
the underground then

13:41.154 --> 13:42.956
yeah, I would look at you
sideways.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.292
[laughs] Yeah, that's my backup
plan

13:45.325 --> 13:47.360
if my rating falls below 4
stars.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.396
Mm.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.300
I guess I gotta see if I'm gonna
take this ride or not.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.454
no longer together.

you this excited about hockey
before.
