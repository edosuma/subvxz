It's this weekend.
Lucas hasn't asked me
to the semi-formal.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.444
We're riley and lucas,

00:12.446 --> 00:14.713

Just tell me what to say.

i'll look at you like this,

00:46.347 --> 00:48.680
And say, "you got a problem."

00:48.682 --> 00:50.816
Stop planning your life
so far in advance.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.368
I'm not.

00:52.369 --> 00:53.919

Yeah, i know.

Semi-formal coming up.

02:47.902 --> 02:50.035
Young men
and young women interacting.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.070
Mixing in a social situation.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.973
So, to avoid any casualties,

02:54.975 --> 02:57.643
I thought we could
discuss etiquette.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.579
Can anyone here tell me
what etiquette is?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.481
No, you can't.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.752
Etiquette is treating people
politely and with respect.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.621
Maya and i will demonstrate
in a short play we put on
before every dance.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.924
It's called, "no."

03:11.926 --> 03:14.092
Miss hart, would you do me
the great honor

03:14.094 --> 03:16.395
Of accompanying me
to the semi-formal festivities?

03:16.397 --> 03:18.530
No.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.399
-Etiquette.
-Etiquette.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.618
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.836
We'll see you at the holidays
for "a christmas no."

03:24.838 --> 03:27.139
(applause)

03:27.141 --> 03:29.074
Okay, so...

03:29.076 --> 03:31.043
The school board
sent me this film.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.578
It's called,

03:32.580 --> 03:36.548
"he asked me, he asked me,
he really asked me."

03:36.550 --> 03:39.384
This is supposed to teach us
how to act at the dance?

03:39.386 --> 03:42.621
They sent it. I'm showing it.
You're animals.

03:44.091 --> 03:47.459
Oh, there's a dance,
and you're planning
to attend this dance

03:47.461 --> 03:50.095
That you never mentioned
in my general vicinity,
that dance?

03:50.097 --> 03:51.496
Actually, i wanna talk
to you about that--

03:51.498 --> 03:52.531
Go on.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.700
Psst. Talk after class.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.835
Have you no sense
of anything?

03:57.771 --> 03:59.738
Nope. Let's watch.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.941
Oh, what's this here?

04:02.943 --> 04:06.645
Well, enjoy the old-time
picture show.

04:09.450 --> 04:12.451
<i>Well, if it isn't</i>
<i>our old friend, billy.</i>

04:12.453 --> 04:15.020
<i>Last time we saw you, billy,</i>

04:15.021 --> 04:17.588
<i>You were teaching us that</i>
<i>our bodies go through strange</i>
<i>and horrifying changes.</i>

04:17.591 --> 04:18.690
Uck.

04:18.692 --> 04:23.495
<i>But today, we're here to talk</i>
<i>about the biggest night</i>
<i>in a young person's life.</i>

04:23.497 --> 04:25.147
<i>The semi-formal.</i>

04:25.148 --> 04:26.798
<i>Billy's been looking forward</i>
<i>to it all year.</i>

04:26.800 --> 04:28.166
<i>Isn't that right, billy?</i>

04:30.037 --> 04:31.770
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>slow down, billy.</i>

04:31.772 --> 04:33.438
<i>Because you know who hangs out</i>
<i>at dances?</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.575
<i>Your old friends polio,</i>
<i>typhoid, and the devil.</i>

04:36.577 --> 04:37.976
He's mean.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.078
<i>Now, let's meet</i>
<i>your best gal, sally,</i>

04:40.080 --> 04:43.615
<i>Who, since you're a gentleman,</i>
<i>you asked to the dance at least</i>
<i>10 months in advance.</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:44.716
(bell dings)

04:45.886 --> 04:47.703
Billy gets it.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.521
Billy's dead, and all of his
friends are dead too.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.624
Except one. No, wait,
now he's dead too.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.861
It does seem like relationships
are a little more complex now

04:55.863 --> 04:57.195
Than they were in the 1950s.

04:57.197 --> 04:59.064
I just wanna be asked
to the dance.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.465
-You wanna go to the dance?
-No.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.621
Oh, you've seen my play.

05:05.622 --> 05:07.072
<i>Meet sally.</i>
<i>She's a good girl.</i>

05:07.074 --> 05:10.208
<i>Sally's dreaming of her</i>
<i>handsome prince sweeping</i>
<i>her off her feet.</i>

05:10.210 --> 05:12.377
<i>Did he ask you, sally?</i>

05:12.378 --> 05:14.545
He asked me, he asked me!
He really asked me!

05:15.482 --> 05:17.149
You and me, sally.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.817
Front of the notebook, baby.

05:20.054 --> 05:22.104
<i>Because everybody knows</i>

05:22.105 --> 05:24.155
<i>The semi-formal is the dance</i>
<i>that determines the rest</i>
<i>of your life.</i>

05:24.158 --> 05:26.925
Oh, there's nothing like
a beautiful gown that
makes you feel

05:26.927 --> 05:28.527
Like you're in
a beautiful gown.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.230
How you enjoying
the picture show, sally?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.233
Life is so much simpler
in black and white.

05:35.235 --> 05:38.270
<i>Look how billy holds the door</i>
<i>open for sally</i>

05:38.272 --> 05:41.640
<i>So she won't develop</i>
<i>unsightly arm muscles.</i>

05:41.642 --> 05:43.175
<i>Now that's etiquette.</i>

05:43.177 --> 05:44.710
(bell dings)

05:51.985 --> 05:53.251
Yikes.

05:55.189 --> 05:58.957
Okay. So,
can anyone here tell me

05:58.959 --> 06:02.060
If they possibly
learned anything
from that?

06:02.062 --> 06:05.797
Yes. Time to make
some choices, billy.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.967
Simple enough
for you, billy?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.273
(knocking)

06:16.210 --> 06:18.543
Stand aside, underpants.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.678
Underpants?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.079
You're the brother
of a senator now.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.581
Security issues.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.548
That's your codename.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.016
Underpants!

06:25.018 --> 06:26.318
Yeah.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.587
As a new senator,
i need protection.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.239
I'm not sure
if you're aware of this,

06:30.240 --> 06:31.890
There's a lot of people
out there that'd like
to do me harm.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.558
And in here.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.262
Plus, ever since i was elected,

06:37.264 --> 06:39.030
Some guy's been stalking me.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.605
He's there.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.273
Oh, he's walking through
the oorway-day.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.676
Agent lachance, sir.
Secret service.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.912
I'm assigned
to senator matthews'
security detail.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.348
Wait, you are?
Why didn't you tell me?

06:56.350 --> 06:58.350
I've told you
several times, senator.

06:58.352 --> 07:00.285
I keep saying
"secret service,"

07:00.287 --> 07:02.287
You keep saying,
"i'll have the hummus."

07:03.657 --> 07:05.657
And i never got
my hummus.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.628
I'm not room service,
i'm secret service.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.997
I haven't eaten
in three days!

07:14.334 --> 07:16.101
I'm sorry you got
stuck with him.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.271
Actually, he's the smartest
senator i've ever worked with.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.339
Ask him why
he's here...

07:21.341 --> 07:22.974
Underpants.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.342
I'll play along.

07:24.344 --> 07:27.312
Why are you here?

07:27.313 --> 07:30.281
Senate resolution 328-17
awards a multi-billion dollar
natural gas pipeline

07:30.284 --> 07:32.017
To either the good company
or the evil one.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.386
I'm in town to meet with
the guy from the evil company.

07:34.388 --> 07:37.055
He's going to try
to buy my vote.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.223
(sneezes)

07:39.393 --> 07:40.625
Can you be bought?

07:40.627 --> 07:41.326
I don't know.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.230
Eric, is that even
connected to anything?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.649
This? No, this is candy.

07:47.650 --> 07:50.067
(electrical surge)
it's not the candy one!
It's not the candy one!

07:57.211 --> 07:58.643
You know what i think?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.412
I think he's waiting
until the very last minute,

08:00.414 --> 08:01.980
And then he's gonna
do the big ask.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.066
Sure, he is.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.151
First, there'll be balloons
in your locker.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.086
Ooh!

08:08.087 --> 08:10.020
Then, people will hand you roses
until you have a big bouquet.

08:10.023 --> 08:12.057
(gasps)

08:13.927 --> 08:14.960
What the?

08:14.962 --> 08:17.662
Keep making things
happen, maya!

08:17.664 --> 08:18.697
Cory: Aah!

08:18.699 --> 08:21.433
Okay, uh... Disco ball?

08:21.435 --> 08:23.001
Music?
(romantic music swells)

08:23.003 --> 08:24.402
Yogi on skates!

08:24.404 --> 08:26.037
Drop a banner,

08:26.039 --> 08:28.006
And then lucas is right there
next to you.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.040
(needle scratch)

08:29.042 --> 08:30.559
-Riley--
-yes, yes!

08:30.560 --> 08:32.077
I would love to go
to the semi-formal with you!

08:32.079 --> 08:34.813
Good. I was hoping you would.

08:42.456 --> 08:44.323
(mimicking narrator)
meet riley,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.191
A swell gal
who finds herself
in quite the pickle!

08:46.193 --> 08:48.727
What will she do?
What will she do?

08:54.101 --> 08:57.002
When we last left our hero,
she said she'd go to the dance
with charlie gardner.

08:57.004 --> 08:59.271
-That's me.
-Oh, charlie.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.408
I can't believe
that you actually said yes.

09:03.410 --> 09:06.444
I waited because i was sure
lucas was gonna ask you,

09:06.446 --> 09:09.414
But when he didn't,
i just figured there
was a problem.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.751
So, i asked you because i think
a girl like you deserves
to be swept off her feet.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.452
Uh-oh.

09:16.423 --> 09:18.189
What do i do?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.958
Are you asking me?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.494
Because if you're asking me,
i say you give me a chance.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.716
Uh-oh.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.934
Charlie, i want to thank you
for the flowers and the banner
and yogi on skates.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.469
Yeah, i had to teach him.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.138
Yogi: Aah!
(bangs into locker)

09:33.140 --> 09:36.241
But there's only so much
time in the day.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.160
I'm so sorry,
but i can't go.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.078
-You can't go with me?
-No, i can't go with anybody.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.348
-I can't go with anybody because
i can't go with anybody
-yes...

09:43.350 --> 09:45.450
-That night because i can't
go anywhere that night
-yes...

09:45.452 --> 09:47.752
Because my parents
have something that night.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.788
What riley will
realize immediately

09:49.790 --> 09:52.958
Is that her father is one of
the chaperones at the dance.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.360
Isn't your dad one of
the chaperones at the dance?

09:55.362 --> 09:57.796
I'm not talking about
those parents.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.131
Well, there's no coming back
from that.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.467
Uh, yes, yes, there is, maya,

10:02.469 --> 10:04.369
Because, see, my dad
is at the dance,

10:04.371 --> 10:06.538
And my mom, my other parent
i was talking about--

10:06.540 --> 10:08.373
-Okay.
-Is also not home that night.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.842
And so i promised her
i would babysit
my little brother, augie,

10:10.844 --> 10:12.444
Because nobody had asked me
to the dance.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.512
I'm so proud of us.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.114
She's obviously had
a good bad influence.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.083
Well, riley's gotten herself
out of this mess,

10:18.085 --> 10:19.551
What could possibly
go wrong now?

10:19.553 --> 10:20.852
Oh, you can't go
to the dance?

10:20.854 --> 10:22.454
Unbelievable!

10:22.456 --> 10:25.457
Well, you two must
have a lot to talk about.

10:26.493 --> 10:28.193
But before i go,

10:28.195 --> 10:31.196
I'd like you both to know
that i don't regret asking her.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.198
I did it because
i know you're the type of person

10:33.200 --> 10:36.001
Who would give up the dance
to help your parents out.

10:36.003 --> 10:40.238
Uh, let me understand this,
you-- you asked riley
to the dance?

10:40.240 --> 10:43.208
I did because, see,
you didn't.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.577
And i'm sorry, but do you need
more than 10 months?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.414
Charlie, you may not
know this,

10:49.416 --> 10:52.217
But riley and i kinda have
an unofficial thing going.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.819
Yeah, but i've been tracking
this thing all year,

10:54.821 --> 10:56.588
And i've seen both sides
of her notebook.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.925
-You let him see
your notebook?
-It was only one time.

11:04.564 --> 11:06.865
So, what happens now?

11:06.867 --> 11:09.134
Guess that'd depend
on riley, wouldn't it?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.970
Close your mouth, riley.

11:14.408 --> 11:16.841
Well, i'll leave
you guys to it.

11:16.843 --> 11:21.279
(applause)

11:28.555 --> 11:30.622
I just naturally assumed
that we were going together.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.490
-What?
-I thought we were
going together.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.625
I'm-- i should have asked.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.527
-What?
-I'm sorry you can't go.

11:36.930 --> 11:37.996
Do it for me.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.564
Unbelievable!

11:39.566 --> 11:40.632
And now this.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.605
Why, agent lachance,

11:47.606 --> 11:49.606
This might just be the start
of the best friendship since...

11:49.609 --> 11:52.310
Jack, who was that guy
i used to know?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.645
What's up, buddy?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.213
-Jack!
-Eric!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.048
-Hey!
-Come on!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.450
How are you doing?

11:58.452 --> 11:59.617
I'm a senator now,
didn't you hear?

11:59.619 --> 12:02.153
No! Yeah, it's the end
of the world.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.988
Haha! Probably.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.891
So-- i mean, what are
you doing here?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.477
What? I need a reason
to see my friend?

12:09.478 --> 12:12.062
So, we're still friends?
'cause i haven't seen you
in a really long time.

12:12.065 --> 12:15.467
Not a day goes by
that your voice still
isn't inside my head.

12:15.469 --> 12:17.335
No matter what i do.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.604
You know what i'm doing
right now? Come on, sit down.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.973
I'm actually
senatoring right now.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.909
Yeah, i'm waiting for some
evil guy from some
evil company

12:24.911 --> 12:27.679
Who's gonna come in and try
to sleaze his way into my pocket
to buy my vote.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.965
Really? Why would
he do that?

12:29.966 --> 12:32.250
Well, because the other company
is really environmentally
conscious,

12:32.252 --> 12:34.419
And they saved
the polar bears,

12:34.420 --> 12:36.587
But the evil company is scum
who turns clean water
into dirty water,

12:36.590 --> 12:39.958
And hires really
good-looking employees

12:39.960 --> 12:42.393
With pocket squares

12:42.395 --> 12:44.462
And hair
that goes "swoosh"...

12:46.233 --> 12:49.634
To hide their company's
evil faces.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.372
You're still
an idiot genius, aren't you?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.474
Jack hunter joined
the peace corps with
rachel mcguire.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.243
She stayed, you left,
and you joined
an evil company,

12:58.245 --> 13:00.111
And you haven't been
the same ever since.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.246
(sneezes)

13:03.984 --> 13:05.717
You know all about me, huh?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.451
I know what all
my friends are doing.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.587
What i don't know is why?

13:09.589 --> 13:11.489
Remember when
we were kids?

13:11.490 --> 13:13.390
And the toughest choice
we had was which one of us
was gonna end up with rachel?

13:13.393 --> 13:15.326
Rachel!

13:15.328 --> 13:18.029
What we never knew was
that life was preparing us

13:18.031 --> 13:20.165
To make the right
decisions later.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.134
But then, you know,
you get a little older.
Grow up,

13:23.136 --> 13:25.370
And face another choice,

13:25.372 --> 13:27.272
And you make
the wrong decision.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.573
Why does that happen?

13:28.575 --> 13:30.408
I don't know, jack.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.043
I wasn't there.

13:32.045 --> 13:35.446
And now i'm in a position
to influence the whole world.

13:35.448 --> 13:38.283
What do you know?
Me too.

13:38.285 --> 13:42.120
I guess the only choice left
is who influences who.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.589
Well, i guess that's up
to us now, isn't it?

13:44.591 --> 13:45.723
Hey, you free tonight?

13:45.725 --> 13:47.759
Yeah, i'm free.
It's new york city.

13:47.761 --> 13:49.994
-What'cha got in mind, buddy?
-Hahaha, don't touch.

13:54.734 --> 13:55.733
Help me.

13:55.735 --> 13:58.036
I got nothing.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.137
Help me!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.672
This one's a doozy.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.776
You've been in here
six hours.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.110
We don't hear
any talking.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.046
The bay window's broken.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.214
What's up?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.082
I got asked
to the semi-formal.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.283
Oh, lucas got
around to it?

14:12.285 --> 14:14.419
No, lucas assumed
we were going.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.020
I got asked
by charlie.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.388
Gardner?

14:17.390 --> 14:18.423
I like him.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.524
Little quiet, so far.

14:20.794 --> 14:23.728
So, why aren't you dressed?

14:23.730 --> 14:26.164
Because i kinda made up
a story and said i couldn't go.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.466
And lucas overheard,
and now sally's in a pickle!

14:28.468 --> 14:30.635
What is that?
What are you doing?
What is that?

14:30.637 --> 14:33.471
(mimicry continues)
i'm never stopping.
Cheese souffle!

14:34.774 --> 14:38.309
Listen, riley...

14:38.311 --> 14:40.478
I'm disappointed you felt
you had to make up a story.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.046
What's wrong
with charlie?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.082
Nothing. It's just,
he's kinda--

14:44.084 --> 14:45.216
Swell!

14:46.753 --> 14:48.486
I just had this vision
in my head

14:48.488 --> 14:50.755
About how the semi-formal
was supposed to go.

14:50.757 --> 14:55.827
How lucas would ask,
the dress i would wear,
the corsage he would give me.

14:55.829 --> 14:57.629
Riley didn't do
anything wrong.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.097
No?

14:59.099 --> 14:59.797
No.

14:59.799 --> 15:02.133
I think she's just...

15:02.135 --> 15:04.736
Confused about
how she feels.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.738
How am i supposed
to feel, maya?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.539
I like lucas, don't i?

15:08.541 --> 15:11.576
You were me.
How did i feel
when you were me?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.677
What are me and lucas?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.814
Just tell me
what to say.

15:16.816 --> 15:19.150
You know something.
Tell me.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.587
Go to the dance.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.522
I can't.
They're gonna punish me.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.690
Go to the dance.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.859
They're not
gonna punish me.

15:27.861 --> 15:30.695
Actually, we kinda are.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.697
How?

15:32.698 --> 15:34.698
Well, lucas and charlie
are both gonna be at the dance.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.467
You need to face them, riley.

15:36.469 --> 15:37.802
You've got choices
to make.

15:39.839 --> 15:41.372
Oh, boy.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.542
All right, i'll go.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.277
What color
goes with shame?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.884
Riles, look,
big turnout.

15:52.886 --> 15:56.254
Good. Maybe there's a chance
i won't run into either of them.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.358
Oh, this is my punishment.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.226
My parents are smart.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.328
Hi.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.595
Riley, dance?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.630
Absolutely.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.864
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.900
Riley's busy.
I'll dance with you.

16:08.902 --> 16:10.635
That works for me.
You're riley or maya.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.222
I owe you both
an apology.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.607
If we didn't know who
you really are, riley,
then maybe you would.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.643
You don't owe me anything.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.678
So, you guys are both
just gonna let me off the hook?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.580
Mmm... Not really.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.282
Well, then what are
you gonna do?

16:24.284 --> 16:26.735
Well, see, i talked to charlie,

16:26.736 --> 16:29.187
'cause, you know, i thought
he should have known better
than to ask you to this dance.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.439
Yeah, but when i explained
the whole

16:31.440 --> 16:33.690
"10 months, five months,
week before the dance" thing
was kinda disrespectful,

16:33.693 --> 16:35.760
-We decided--
-well, no, charlie.

16:35.761 --> 16:37.828
I think what we came up with
is that it wasn't so much
disrespectful

16:37.831 --> 16:40.765
As it was an assumed
understanding between
my friend riley and me

16:40.767 --> 16:42.934
That we would, you know,
naturally go to
this dance together.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.719
Which is when i said

16:44.720 --> 16:46.503
That the semi-formal deserves
a little extra effort,

16:46.506 --> 16:49.173
Like balloons and roses
and yogi on skates.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.441
Yeah, well...

16:50.443 --> 16:52.176
You know what?
I gotta give you
points for that.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.845
-That was a good one.
-Thanks, man.

16:53.847 --> 16:56.647
After i saw you put her
on a white horse, i knew
i had to bring it.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.351
Yes?

17:00.353 --> 17:01.853
What is going on here?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.322
I really like this guy, riley.
He's all right.

17:04.324 --> 17:06.290
-Yeah, new friendship.
-Thanks to you.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.495
Wait a minute!

17:10.497 --> 17:11.562
What do i do here?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.798
Oh, well, that's
up to you, riley.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.434
Yeah. Why make it
easy for you?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.542
Here we are.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.676
Are you kidding me?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.245
You brought me
to a school dance?

17:27.247 --> 17:29.847
No, jack, i brought you
back in time.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.249
See, look...

17:31.251 --> 17:32.417
There's feeny.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.252
Cory!

17:36.423 --> 17:37.755
-Jack?
-'sup buddy!

17:37.757 --> 17:38.890
-Hey!
-Hey!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.827
How's life treating you?

17:42.828 --> 17:45.262
Well, you know, i'm at
a middle school dance,
and your brother's my date.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.832
So, nothing's changed.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.534
Guys, do you remember?

17:49.536 --> 17:50.868
We used to be
just like them.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.304
I remember us
every day.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.274
What are you guys
doing here?

17:56.275 --> 17:59.243
I wanted to bring him back
to a time when life was
a little less complicated.

17:59.245 --> 18:02.647
I thought it was either gonna be
the front of my notebook
or the back of my notebook,

18:02.649 --> 18:05.516
But now there's another guy,
so i think i'm gonna need
to get a whole new notebook

18:05.518 --> 18:07.385
Because maya won't tell me
how i feel.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.322
Adults have it easy, dad.

18:11.323 --> 18:13.623
All you decide is what's
for dinner and what to put
the thermostat at.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.992
92!

18:14.994 --> 18:16.861
That's why all
the polar bears left.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.329
I'm the one who
global warmed them.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.267
Dad? Wait,
this is your daughter?

18:23.269 --> 18:24.735
-Hi, i'm riley.
-Hi.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.838
Oh, hi, riley,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.406
What is it like
having a daughter, man?

18:28.408 --> 18:29.941
How do you like
two people differently?

18:31.478 --> 18:34.045
Jack, you wanna know what
it's like having a daughter?

18:34.047 --> 18:35.012
Why don't you
take this one?

18:36.382 --> 18:37.582
Oh, buddy.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.285
Well, um...

18:40.286 --> 18:42.987
Okay, there was once this girl
who had to make a choice
between eric and me.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.355
She liked me
as a boyfriend.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.990
-And she liked me--
-how?

18:45.992 --> 18:47.492
How did she like you?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.293
She liked me
as a brother.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.967
Are you two still friends?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.969
You know what?
I haven't seen her
in a really long time.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.071
Are you two
still friends?

19:00.073 --> 19:01.873
Yeah, we talk all the time.

19:01.875 --> 19:03.708
She and i
are still great friends.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.544
Keep your friends around
as long as you can.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.412
That's the best choice
you can make.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.983
Dad?

19:11.985 --> 19:14.452
Riley, you got
a lot to think about.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.053
Why don't you go
dance with your friends?

19:19.993 --> 19:22.360
Man...

19:22.362 --> 19:25.363
Keeping you around was
always the best choice i ever
made, wasn't it?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.731
Yeah. I gotta go.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.670
Hey, everybody. Hi.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.605
You all helped

19:34.607 --> 19:37.074

a little bit special for you.

19:37.076 --> 19:40.478

20:31.631 --> 20:33.848
If we're not
officially together?

20:33.849 --> 20:36.066
I don't know. Why would you
make a big deal about it if
we're not officially together?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.135
Why would you make such
a big deal about me asking her

Hi. I'm senator eric matthews,

22:15.501 --> 22:17.001
And this is my niche, riley.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.035
Hi.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.236
And her friend, mayonnaise.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.971
You're not even
trying anymore.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.940
When i was a kid like them,

22:22.941 --> 22:24.908
There used to be polar bears
all over new york city.

22:24.911 --> 22:28.179
But now, because of
"uh-oh, we broke the earth,"

22:28.181 --> 22:30.548
These bears have been forced
to move to places

22:30.550 --> 22:32.216
Their travel agents told them
were colder,

22:32.218 --> 22:34.118
But aren't anymore.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.520
Help me make
the right decisions.

22:36.522 --> 22:40.057
Let's make the world cold
where it's supposed to be.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.259
It's the warm thing to do.

22:42.261 --> 22:45.629
This message is brought to you
by... My heart.
