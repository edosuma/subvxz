WEBVTT

00:08.142 --> 00:09.577
Jackie, hurry up.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.711
I'm next.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.612
OK, sorry.

00:11.645 --> 00:12.846
I got a few things for myself.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.814
I'll pay you back later.

00:13.847 --> 00:14.715
What did you get?

00:14.748 --> 00:16.550
Just stuff.

00:16.584 --> 00:18.386
Oh, let's see.

00:18.419 --> 00:23.091
Disposable razors, Amaretto
Mist instant coffee,

00:23.124 --> 00:26.827
and a soft pink light bulb.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.995
So, who is he?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.297
Who's who?

00:29.330 --> 00:30.231
The guy you're dating.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.499
What?

00:31.532 --> 00:33.934
I just want to kick back,
have a nice cup of coffee,

00:33.967 --> 00:36.804
and shave my legs in
a flattering light.

00:36.837 --> 00:38.272
- He's married, isn't he?
- No.

00:38.306 --> 00:39.973
Well, he's not going to
leave his wife, you know.

00:40.007 --> 00:41.742
They say they will but
they ever, ever do.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.111
Roseanne, he is not married.

00:43.144 --> 00:46.314
He's just a guy that I
met at that singles dance.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.149
OK.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.350
So what's wrong with him?

00:49.383 --> 00:52.086
Nothing.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.654
He's just younger.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.793
Well, how much younger is he?

00:59.827 --> 01:03.030
Like way young, like
milk money young?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.399
No.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.734
Look, he can drive.

01:06.767 --> 01:07.735
He can vote.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.137
So let's drop it.

01:09.170 --> 01:13.207
I'm just not that
comfortable with it myself.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.208
So is he cute?

01:14.242 --> 01:15.109
Yes.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.810
And he's fun and he's smart.

01:16.844 --> 01:18.045
Oh, God he's so smart.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.047
He is so not for me.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.052
God, you have such
low self-esteem.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.854
You're such an idiot.

01:26.887 --> 01:27.921
Thank you.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.657
End of conversation.

01:29.690 --> 01:34.428
Can we move the
belt here, please?

01:34.462 --> 01:36.430
Now, that's not what I meant.

01:36.464 --> 01:40.134
What I meant was, you know,
it's too early for you

01:40.168 --> 01:42.136
to know if he's
right for you or not.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.272
So I think you
should let me decide.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.474
No, Roseanne, I'm not
bringing this one over.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.375
Come on, let me meet him.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.409
No way,

01:48.442 --> 01:50.110
Oh come on, I'll be nice.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.011
You will not.

01:51.044 --> 01:51.945
Dan will.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.914
No.

01:53.947 --> 01:58.652
I am not going to subject
Fisher to your abuse.

01:58.686 --> 02:01.255
Fisher.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.956
Roseanne.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.226
Come on, Jackie, I
want to meet Fisher.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.261
Come on.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.430
All right.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.499
OK, well, dinner on Thursday.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.634
And, hey have you
told him any lies

02:13.667 --> 02:16.170
that I ought to know about?

02:16.204 --> 02:19.740
Just that I'm 33.

02:19.773 --> 02:22.109
OK, and that I was
one of those girls

02:22.142 --> 02:23.811
in the Robert Palmer video.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.214
[theme music]

03:14.395 --> 03:17.064
Well, I hope you
like instant, Fisher,

03:17.097 --> 03:18.732
because that's all we got.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.501
Oh no, that's fine.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.035
You know, dinner
was great, Roseanne,

03:22.069 --> 03:24.705
everything was delicious.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.541
Yeah, right.

03:27.575 --> 03:32.079
Compliments will only
get you seconds, Fisher.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.214
Boy, I am full.

03:34.248 --> 03:36.183
Atta boy.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.387
So, Fisher, Jackie tells
me that the two of you

03:39.420 --> 03:41.121
met at some singles' dance.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.590
Oh, God.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.758
Oh, I'm just
curious, you know,

03:44.792 --> 03:46.927
how come somebody
like you would have

03:46.960 --> 03:48.529
to go to one of those things?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.497
Well, cause--

03:49.530 --> 03:50.931
No, I know why you would.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.803
I'm talking to Fisher here.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.837
I don't know.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.672
I'm not the greatest
at meeting people.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.574
And I thought so
I'd give it a try.

04:00.608 --> 04:05.813
And then I saw someone pretty,
with great legs and this just

04:05.846 --> 04:08.916
terrific energy
and I thought, wow,

04:08.949 --> 04:11.652
that's somebody I got to meet.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.886
Wow, excellent answer.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.825
Compliments will
only get you seconds.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.062
I'm home.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.065
Well, Darlene, come on
in here and meet your Aunt

04:25.098 --> 04:27.735
Jackie's new boyfriend.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.738
Now, she's really sensitive
about the age thing, see,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.573
so we're all on
our best behavior.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.342
Yeah, OK.

04:34.375 --> 04:38.312
Fisher, this is
our little Darlene.

04:38.346 --> 04:39.513
Aren't you in
my science class?

04:47.421 --> 04:51.525
Well, she held out longer
than I thought she would.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
What kind of work
you in, Fisher?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.228
I'm a commercial artist.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.129
Really?

04:56.163 --> 04:57.064
Cool.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.198
My boyfriend draws comics.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.099
Oh yeah?

04:59.132 --> 05:00.300
Like what kind of stuff?

05:00.334 --> 05:03.236
Oh, just stuff I write,
you know, sci-fi, Gothic.

05:03.270 --> 05:06.106
He's really starting to perfect
his disemboweled body parts.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.778
But his vomit still
needs a little work.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.580
I can make a vomit sound.

05:12.613 --> 05:13.481
Oh, yeah, DJ?

05:13.514 --> 05:14.382
Let's hear it.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.518
Little tip, Fisher.

05:17.551 --> 05:22.122
He can't make the sound
without actually doing it.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.791
You save it for later, honey.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.662
So, Dan, what
business are you in?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.030
[mumbling]

05:30.063 --> 05:30.931
What?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.900
It's all right.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.035
I used to own a bike
shop, but it went under,

05:35.068 --> 05:36.336
so now I'm doing
a little drywall.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.906
Oh, drywall that's very--

05:38.939 --> 05:40.140
[mumbling]

05:40.173 --> 05:41.409
What about you, Roseanne?

05:41.442 --> 05:42.776
[mumbling]

05:45.245 --> 05:49.483
Well, when I'm not busy
being a unemployed housewife

05:49.517 --> 05:54.021
and mother, I try to fulfill
my duties as Miss Illinois.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.823
[phone rings]

05:58.258 --> 06:00.093
Hello?

06:00.127 --> 06:01.128
Oh, hi, Mom.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.430
Oh, that's Grandma.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.831
Before you ask, she's
getting divorced

06:03.864 --> 06:07.768
from Grandpa, who's shacking up
with some babe in Kansas City.

06:07.801 --> 06:09.302
More coffee?

06:09.336 --> 06:10.404
Yeah, really.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.805
That's great.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.941
Yeah, well, we're all just
sitting here having dinner.

06:13.974 --> 06:17.745
Um, Jackie's over with
her new boyfriend.

06:17.778 --> 06:19.847
Fisher.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.781
Uh, huh.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.082
Oh, yeah, like a horse.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.622
Oh, she's just asking
about your appetite.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.198
I think that's great.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.099
Yeah.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.234
Congratulations.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.403
OK, well, I'll talk
to you soon then.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.337
Yeah.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.172
Bye.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.408
Mom sold the house.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.309
That was fast.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.078
She happy about it?

06:51.111 --> 06:54.482
Well, uh, you can
ask her yourself.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.217
She'll be here on Saturday.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.887
No.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.522
That's how we feel, Fisher.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.290
You'll probably like her.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.157
She's really old.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.502
[doorbell rings]

07:14.535 --> 07:16.937
Hello, everybody!

07:16.970 --> 07:20.874
I'm so happy to
be with my family.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.142
Dan, how are you doing?

07:25.646 --> 07:26.880
I'm all right.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.248
Hi, Mom!

07:28.281 --> 07:29.650
Hello, Jackie.

07:29.683 --> 07:32.620
I'm sorry about the blouse.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.354
Dan, would you help
Mom with her bag?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.456
Sure.

07:36.490 --> 07:39.459
Whoa. this puppy's
got some heft to it.

07:39.493 --> 07:42.896
Hey, a bag like
this has how many

07:42.930 --> 07:46.299
days worth of clothes, three?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.868
Four?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.169
Five?

07:49.202 --> 07:50.504
Dan.

07:50.538 --> 07:53.907
So, where are my sweet,
wonderful grandchildren?

07:53.941 --> 07:57.911
They were killed
by DJ and Darlene.

07:57.945 --> 08:01.448
Mom, what was it like to
actually sell the house?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.784
Actually, it
was a huge relief.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.686
How's Dad doing with all this?

08:05.719 --> 08:09.322
Well, I imagine he's pretty
depressed by the settlement.

08:09.356 --> 08:12.225
Remember how he always
dreamed of retiring?

08:12.259 --> 08:13.393
Not going to happen.

08:16.363 --> 08:20.500
Boy, you should see the way your
face lit up when you said that.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.102
For good reason.

08:22.135 --> 08:26.073
Why don't you forget the tea
for a moment and come sit down?

08:26.106 --> 08:28.308
What's going on?

08:28.341 --> 08:34.414
Now, you know, I'm going
to be getting a lot of money

08:34.447 --> 08:36.750
from this house and I
could wait until I die,

08:36.784 --> 08:39.319
but I want to see
it put to good use

08:39.352 --> 08:42.422
now when you seem
to need it so much.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.325
So, this is for you.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.294
And since you always
throw a fit when you're

08:47.327 --> 08:49.496
left out of anything, here.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.199
Well, thanks.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.034
Oh, my god.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.669
It's $10,000.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
So is this.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.874
Oh, Mom, you have no idea how
much we need this right now.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.409
Oh god, thank you.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.276
This is amazing.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.477
Mom!

09:04.511 --> 09:08.916
Well, it makes me so
happy that I have it to give

09:08.949 --> 09:11.284
to you and your father doesn't.

09:14.622 --> 09:21.161
I think this calls for a
celebration at La Sizzler.

09:21.194 --> 09:27.000
We're all getting our
own plates this time.

09:27.034 --> 09:31.204
It's so important to
just see you girls happy.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.374
I just wish I could do more.

09:34.407 --> 09:38.578
So I was thinking,
since I sold the house,

09:38.612 --> 09:42.249
why don't I just
move to Lanford?

09:42.282 --> 09:45.719
Then we can all be together.

09:45.753 --> 09:46.920
Now hold the party.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.221
I'm going to go freshen up.

09:56.563 --> 09:57.765
God, she's good.

10:04.571 --> 10:05.505
That wasn't fair, Jackie.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.708
She is just trying
to butter us up,

10:07.741 --> 10:09.476
Roseanne, so that she
can move to Lanford

10:09.509 --> 10:11.344
and we can't say
a thing about it.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.253
Who's moving here?

10:20.287 --> 10:21.254
Dan.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.155
No.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.056
Dan.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.758
No, Roseanne, no!

10:24.792 --> 10:27.260
Ah, come on.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.362
Dan, she needs to be
near her family now.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.463
No, she doesn't.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.832
She may think she
does right now,

10:31.865 --> 10:33.533
but after two months
and I have to kill her,

10:33.566 --> 10:35.836
she'll realize
how wrong she was.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.271
She knew we would all
feel this way, Roseanne.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.607
That's why she's waving
this money around.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
Yeah!
What money?

10:43.510 --> 10:44.377
It's from Mom.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.549
Yubba.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.251
She's just trying
to buy us, Dan.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.053
Can't you see that?
- Yeah.

10:53.086 --> 10:53.921
I think she hit my price.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.228
Actually, she could
have had me for half.

11:04.064 --> 11:04.932
Roseanne.

11:04.965 --> 11:05.999
Honey, honey.

11:06.033 --> 11:06.900
She's your mother.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.435
I'll do whatever it takes.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.739
But, I just want you
to know one thing.

11:11.772 --> 11:15.208
I want this money.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.443
Would you give me that check?

11:16.476 --> 11:18.311
You are drooling
the zeros off of it.

11:27.587 --> 11:30.423
Why do you do all that?

11:30.457 --> 11:33.727
It's a lot of
responsibility being a woman.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.929
God made us the bearer children.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.098
We keep the human race going.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.100
And it's all very
drying to the skin.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.140
Well, it hardly
seems worth it.

11:47.174 --> 11:50.077
You know, Darlene, if you're
old enough to have a boyfriend,

11:50.110 --> 11:52.813
you're old enough to
start a beauty ritual.

11:52.846 --> 11:56.649
After all, skin is a gift.

11:56.683 --> 11:59.586
I'll remember that.

11:59.619 --> 12:02.722
Did your mother tell you I'm
thinking of moving to Lanford?

12:02.756 --> 12:04.691
Really?

12:04.724 --> 12:06.927
Will you be moving
before my birthday?

12:09.897 --> 12:13.200
I mean, it's my 16th,
you know, pretty big.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.270
My, that is an important year.

12:17.304 --> 12:20.774
I'm saving up to buy a CD
player, sort of a birthday gift

12:20.808 --> 12:21.608
to myself.

12:25.478 --> 12:29.116
A CD player sounds fun.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.385
What do you say you
let your grandma buy

12:32.419 --> 12:34.822
it for you a little bit early?

12:34.855 --> 12:36.523
Oh, no, I couldn't
let you do that.

12:36.556 --> 12:42.362
I mean they're too expensive,
the good ones anyhow.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.898
Nonsense.

12:44.932 --> 12:49.202
And if you like, we can just
keep it between you and me.

12:49.236 --> 12:53.406
, Sometimes it's good for us
girls to have a little secret.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.246
Good night, sweetheart.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.727
Hey!

13:14.761 --> 13:15.628
Hey, guys.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.897
Hey, Jackie.

13:16.930 --> 13:20.433
Roseanne, I have got two
words for you, loose meat.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.272
I got two words for you too.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.674
No, it's this
great idea I got.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.476
See, every time I make
a run through Iowa,

13:29.509 --> 13:31.444
I stop at this incredible
little diner that

13:31.478 --> 13:32.980
sells loose meat sandwiches.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.682
It's kind of like Sloppy
Joes, but without the slop.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.484
And anyway, the place
is always packed.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.386
So I'm thinking maybe
we could pool our money

13:39.419 --> 13:41.088
and open up a place
like that in Lanford

13:41.121 --> 13:42.990
and you know, be like partners.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.358
Good morning, Jackie.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.929
You didn't tell
me Mom was here.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.430
Jackie, Mom's here.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.598
Morning, Mom.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.400
We'll talk about it later.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.534
No, please, go on.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.836
I always love to hear
your little ideas.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.272
Yeah, so you can
criticize them.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.440
No, that's not true.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.010
I think it's wonderful
that you have ideas.

14:03.043 --> 14:05.245
If you don't keep having
ideas, how are you ever going

14:05.278 --> 14:07.047
to come up with a good one?

14:07.080 --> 14:09.182
This is a good one.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.018
I have a great idea.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.587
Why don't the two
of you shut up?

14:14.621 --> 14:18.191
Well, I'm sorry, but your
sister should know better.

14:18.225 --> 14:21.761
Starting a business
these days is insane.

14:21.794 --> 14:25.933
Didn't she learn anything from
Dan's little bike shop fiasco?

14:25.966 --> 14:31.871
Mom, what part of shut
up do you not understand?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.941
Well, I can't
stand by and let her

14:33.974 --> 14:37.744
encourage you to waste my money
on one of her foolish ideas.

14:37.777 --> 14:38.811
Oh, stupid me.

14:38.845 --> 14:40.981
I thought the money was a gift.

14:41.014 --> 14:44.117
Skin is gift.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.319
I'll be out in the car.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.655
Whoa, where are you going?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.057
Nowhere.

14:50.090 --> 14:53.093
Oh, we're just going to do a
little early birthday shopping.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.461
Yeah?

14:54.494 --> 14:56.529
Darlene, what are you trying
to weasel out of your grandma?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.497
Nothing but love.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.702
- Bull.
- And a CD player.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
No way.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.374
What, so you get
$10,000 and I get nothing?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.942
Well, you know what
they say, Darlene, wealth

15:08.976 --> 15:10.377
always skips a generation.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.483
No CD player, Mom.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.118
How many times have we
had this conversation?

15:18.151 --> 15:20.520
I told you I want you
stop spoiling the kids.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.122
I wasn't doing anything wrong.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.292
Well, then why were you
trying to do it behind my back?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.128
Because you force us to do
things that way, Roseanne.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.764
No one can do anything in this
house without you interfering.

15:31.798 --> 15:34.934
Well, that's
because it's my house.

15:34.968 --> 15:35.868
I like it this way.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.170
I like the kids poor.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.871
That way they don't
clash with the furniture.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.578
For God's sake,
why deprive the child

15:45.612 --> 15:47.480
just because you're struggling.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.017
Learn from your mistakes.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.785
What is that supposed to mean?

15:52.819 --> 15:54.221
Well, maybe if
you'd been a little

15:54.254 --> 15:57.824
more concerned about Becky's
happiness, she'd still be here.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.409
Here, take your check back.

16:16.443 --> 16:17.777
Jackie's right.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.579
It's never going to work with
you moving here, because it

16:19.612 --> 16:20.513
will always be like this.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.817
Fine.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.886
Why don't I just leave now?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.155
Fine.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.791
See you at Thanksgiving.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.193
What did you invite her
to Thanksgiving for?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.774
Can I come in?

16:47.807 --> 16:48.808
It's your house.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.809
You can do whatever you like.

16:57.016 --> 17:02.089
Well, this is
hard for me to say.

17:02.122 --> 17:02.989
Go ahead.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.892
You'll feel better.

17:05.925 --> 17:06.826
I want the check back.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.067
Pardon me?

17:14.101 --> 17:16.769
Well, you gave it to
us cause we needed it

17:16.803 --> 17:17.937
and we still need it.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.075
Here.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.176
I told you it was yours.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.421
It's not like I don't
appreciate it or nothing.

17:34.454 --> 17:38.625
Well, you have a
frightening way of showing it.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.494
I've never felt
so unwelcome here.

17:41.528 --> 17:42.395
Oh, sure you have.

17:46.799 --> 17:49.102
Now, what are you
going to do now?

17:49.136 --> 17:51.138
I suppose I'll
go back to Moline

17:51.171 --> 17:53.140
and rent a little apartment.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.275
Maybe I'll buy
some new furniture.

17:55.308 --> 17:58.044
And then I'll just sit
in a room until it's time

17:58.077 --> 18:01.214
to lie in a box.

18:01.248 --> 18:04.551
Well, at least
you have a plan.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.454
Maybe I'll get one of
those Life Alert things,

18:07.487 --> 18:08.755
so I'll have someone to talk to.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.190
Oh, come on, Mom.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.791
Don't do this.

18:11.824 --> 18:15.061
Now would you please get Dan
to help me with these bags?

18:15.094 --> 18:17.063
Come on, Mom, now
we just all got mad

18:17.096 --> 18:18.398
and we said stuff
that we didn't mean.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.900
Now put the bags
down and we'll talk.

18:20.933 --> 18:21.734
Oh, Roseanne.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.041
Get in here, Jackie.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.511
Now, we both know we
can't leave it like this.

18:36.149 --> 18:39.986
mom, maybe you could move
here to Lanford if we would

18:40.019 --> 18:43.556
just agree on some stuff first.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.092
I'm listening.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.461
All right, well,
first of all--

18:48.495 --> 18:49.362
You can't leave your house.

18:56.236 --> 19:00.873
First of all, what I
say goes around here.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.742
And no more of this secret
present crap either.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.344
And I do not want to
hear one more word

19:04.377 --> 19:06.012
about how we screwed
up with the shop

19:06.045 --> 19:07.314
or how we screwed up with Becky.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.582
And I want you to respect
the fact that I'm an adult

19:09.616 --> 19:11.017
and I can make my own decisions.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.452
And there are
certain things that I

19:12.485 --> 19:17.324
don't want to hear any more like
flaky, skinny, die a spinster.

19:17.357 --> 19:20.059
That's just for Mom, right?

19:20.092 --> 19:23.062
Jackie, I only
tell you these things

19:23.095 --> 19:25.598
because I want to see you
do something with your life

19:25.632 --> 19:28.235
before it's too late.

19:28.268 --> 19:31.271
Call us when
you get home, Mom.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.906
I can't see anything
to you girls, can I?

19:33.940 --> 19:35.208
Now you're getting it.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.108
What?

19:36.142 --> 19:37.310
Is that what you really want?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.846
No, but if you're
going to move here,

19:39.879 --> 19:42.215
it's just like we have to make
a lot of changes, you know.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.383
We have to get used to it.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.686
We'll have to change and
you'll have to change.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.021
But right now let's
start with you.

19:51.691 --> 19:56.729
All right, what
do you have in Mind

19:56.763 --> 20:01.968
Well, maybe it would work if
we just tried being friends.

20:02.001 --> 20:04.837
We are friends.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.206
No, no, no, we're not.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.174
Isn't she cute?

20:08.207 --> 20:11.944
No, see, friends
are not judgmental,

20:11.978 --> 20:14.547
you know, and there's
camaraderie, you know.

20:14.581 --> 20:17.784
Friends don't drive
you into therapy.

20:17.817 --> 20:18.685
Therapy?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.320
Who's in therapy?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.153
Roseanne.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.925
Not important.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.794
So, how do you feel, Mom?

20:30.397 --> 20:36.135
All right, I'll be
friends, if I'm wanted.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.570
Jackie.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.605
OK, friends.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.044
All right, well, now
let's go downstairs

20:45.077 --> 20:48.781
and practice being friends,
not mothers and daughters,

20:48.815 --> 20:51.551
but friends.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.787
Not too weird.

20:54.821 --> 20:55.755
All right.

20:55.788 --> 20:56.756
This could be fun.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.458
And you know as
your friend, I just

20:58.491 --> 20:59.992
wanted to tell you
you're treating

21:00.026 --> 21:00.960
your mother very badly.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.770
Didn't I see a for rent
sign though out in front

21:10.803 --> 21:13.606
of the Bowman house next door?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.676
Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.979
I just hope they hosed all
the blood off the walls.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.581
[doorbell rings]

21:21.614 --> 21:22.615
I'll get it.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.317
You girls just keep
fighting over me.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.489
Oh, hello.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.690
Come in.

21:30.723 --> 21:33.960
Darlene, your boyfriend's here.
