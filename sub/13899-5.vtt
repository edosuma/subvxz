So Garrison Steele,

00:05.330 --> 00:06.630
writer of all
things garbage, calls.

00:06.670 --> 00:08.000
And you just come running.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.460
Every time that fella
shows up in town,

00:09.510 --> 00:12.470
I end up with the poopy
end of the stick.

00:12.510 --> 00:13.590
[Malachy]
First off--

00:13.630 --> 00:15.140
That's incentive enough for me.

00:15.180 --> 00:17.640
Secondly -- Mister Steele said
it was an emergency.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.850
So just look at it like any
other paying gig.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.390
Some things are just not
worth the money.

00:23.310 --> 00:24.900
I've literally never heard you

00:24.940 --> 00:26.860
utter those words before
in your life.

00:26.900 --> 00:28.480
You know,
you and Leslie--

00:28.520 --> 00:30.530
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Anything that
you have to say about Leslie.

00:30.570 --> 00:32.450
Anything that you're thinking
about saying about Leslie --

00:32.490 --> 00:34.030
Just mind your own business.

00:34.070 --> 00:37.160
Just trying to be sensitive to
your situation, me maw mouth.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.740
Offer a little insight.

00:38.780 --> 00:39.830
You want some insight?

00:39.870 --> 00:42.080
She was, she is, she was,
married.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.910
Okay, how's that for insight?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.920
She thought Callum was dead
for eight years.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.420
She's got a lot to process
right now.

00:48.460 --> 00:50.090
Where are we going?

00:50.130 --> 00:51.970
Elevator.
That way.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.760
You know I need this
like I need a hole in the head.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.720
That's the spirit.

00:59.930 --> 01:00.810
Steele?

01:02.890 --> 01:04.480
Well.

01:04.520 --> 01:06.190
Someone was having a time.

01:07.150 --> 01:10.320
Uh, involving some blood,
Dad.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.190
And lots of it.

What's going on?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.330

Everything is gonna be okay.

01:27.370 --> 01:28.580
Jake. Call the police.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.960
Hang on a second.

01:38.430 --> 01:39.970
Jake.

01:40.810 --> 01:41.720
Help me.

Okay. Easier question.

Why did you

in the closet?

02:44.910 --> 02:46.910

02:46.950 --> 02:49.250
Although admittedly,
the handcuffs are mine,

02:49.290 --> 02:51.000
but they are strictly
recreational.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.000
And you can't recall anything
about last night?

02:53.040 --> 02:53.960

There's a good chance
this is fatal.

-Yeah, no kidding.
-So where's the body?

You still look incredibly
beautiful in the morning.

04:25.430 --> 04:27.140
You were declared legally dead.

not married any more.

There wasn't a day that went by

There was a funeral.

shooting up the place?

this place up.

on the carpet.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.890
Oh no. No. No.
You're not.

08:39.930 --> 08:42.560
Um. We sold him
the lifetime rights, Jake.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.390
Wow. This is great news,
Garrison.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.020
You sold him--?
We-- What?

08:46.060 --> 08:47.610
I thought you were done
with that stuff.

08:47.650 --> 08:50.690
I thought so too.
But my fans love the series.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.150
Thank you again, Jake.

08:52.190 --> 08:55.070
You portrayed me
as a moronic, compulsive,

08:55.110 --> 08:57.530
crying idiot private detective
who literally

08:57.570 --> 08:58.910
stumbles on the clues.

08:58.950 --> 09:01.500
I know. Sometimes it's hard
to see one's true self

09:01.540 --> 09:02.750
through another's eyes.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.250
Besides,
they were best sellers.

09:04.290 --> 09:05.330
Which makes no sense.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.380
The other books
were much better.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.000
Where is this latest manuscript?

09:08.040 --> 09:10.250
My assistant, Nancy Burton,
is holding it for safe keeping.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.090
I wrote it on my old typewriter.
It's the only copy.

09:13.130 --> 09:14.260
[Rachel]
Nancy.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.760
She was at the hotel last night.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.510
Yeah.
Yeah she was.

09:17.550 --> 09:18.930
You know,
it could be her blood

09:18.970 --> 09:20.430
that's splattered
all over that room.

09:20.470 --> 09:21.390
Do you have a picture of her,
by any chance?

09:21.430 --> 09:23.310
[Steele]
Nancy.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.430
You don't think--

09:24.480 --> 09:25.440
[Mal]
It's not for sure.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.600
But we need to find her.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.610
[Rachel]
She could be at my place.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.110
I gave her a spare key
yesterday.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.320
So we could have some privacy.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.740
Excellent.
I got this.

09:33.780 --> 09:35.450
No, no, no, no.
You got nothing.

09:35.490 --> 09:37.030
Jake's right.
You're a wanted man.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.070
I got it.
Rachel.

09:38.110 --> 09:39.950
-No problem.
-Till then, my sweet.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.160
Now what?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.540
I'm looking through the

09:45.580 --> 09:47.370
photos that you took on my phone
of the crime scene.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.290
[Steele]
Hmm.

09:51.500 --> 09:51.800
What?

09:52.710 --> 09:54.050
[Leslie] A hotel worker said

09:54.090 --> 09:55.380
he might have seen someone
fitting the description

09:55.420 --> 09:58.220
of Jake and Garrison Steele
driving away.

09:58.260 --> 09:59.470
I have Forensics on the way.

09:59.510 --> 10:01.100
Looks like we have a crime scene
on our hands.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.720
Sir.
You can't be here.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.890
Sorry. Just doing my job.
Trying to anyway.

10:07.190 --> 10:08.900
The room is under Steele's name,
but was paid for

10:08.940 --> 10:10.770
by a Rachel Molloy.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.650
Get Officers Doyle and Grayson
Mann to check into that lead,

10:12.690 --> 10:14.730
-would ya?
-Tinny and Grayson?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.530
You heard they broke up, right?

10:16.570 --> 10:18.570
Drama.
Gets in the way of the work.

10:18.610 --> 10:19.950
That's why I never indulge
in the office

10:19.990 --> 10:21.530
romance.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.620
Hood.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.040
Just do it.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.290
[Rose] We need to call Leslie.

10:27.330 --> 10:29.170
I know this is a tough time
for both of you.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.500
I could call her,
if you want.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.460
No, no. It's fine.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.090
I can call her. I just--

10:33.130 --> 10:35.170
I try not to talk about her,
because she gets on my mind.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.210
And when she's on my mind,

10:36.260 --> 10:37.340
that's all I can ever
think about.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.880
I hear that Leslie
is actually married.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.510
Amazing stuff,
Jake. You must be a mess.

10:42.550 --> 10:46.600
Wha? Man. B'ys the rumor mill
is clearly in full swing today.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.150
Everybody stop talking
about Leslie.

10:50.190 --> 10:51.650
-Got it?
-Word.

10:51.690 --> 10:53.060
I shan't broach
the subject again.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.730
Thank you for the change of
clothes, my darling Rose.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.820
Malachy has much better taste
than his progeny.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.360
So what's next?

11:00.410 --> 11:01.870
[Steele]
We keep looking. We must.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.280
Foul play is afoot.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.280
This is a job for the police,
you know.

11:05.330 --> 11:07.120
And besides, there are people
who are worried about you.

11:07.160 --> 11:08.370
Namely, your publisher

11:08.410 --> 11:09.870
and ex-wife,
Danielle Roberts.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.210
She says you owe her a book.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.880
Danielle was here?
She's insane.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.550
You have to keep her
away from me.

11:15.590 --> 11:17.550
She also knows you've been
coming to St. John's for months.

11:17.590 --> 11:19.670
Why have you been coming to town
for months?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.260
Just to spend time with Rachel.

11:22.300 --> 11:23.970
She, like al Newfoundland women,

11:24.010 --> 11:25.060
is truly inspiring.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.350
[Des]
Oh my God. Mr. Steele.

11:26.390 --> 11:29.640
Do you see it?
Do you see it? The whip.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.390
The brandy bottle.
The blood stain.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.020
A trifecta of evidence
which tell a story.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.270
One that's already been written.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.280
It's from To Kill a Mocking Man.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.780
He's right.

11:38.820 --> 11:41.280
You're saying that someone
recreated a crime scene

11:41.320 --> 11:43.820
based on something
from one of these crap novels.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.240
Now, first off,
it's a masterpiece.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.660
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

11:46.700 --> 11:50.500
Secondly, exactly. Down to a T,
or whip, as it were.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.290
Why would someone do that?

11:52.330 --> 11:53.290
[ring]

11:53.330 --> 11:54.290
[Garrison and Jake]
Leslie?

11:56.670 --> 11:58.210
Where's Garrison Steele?

11:58.260 --> 11:59.710
Garrison Steele?

11:59.760 --> 12:01.430
Why would I know
where Garrison Steele is?

12:01.470 --> 12:02.590
I need to talk to him.

12:02.630 --> 12:04.140
There was an anonymous tip
of a homicide.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.470
And his hotel room
supports the theory.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.850
Okay. What makes you think he'd
even be in contact with me?

12:08.890 --> 12:10.730
I mean, if he is here,
he knows that I...

12:10.770 --> 12:13.100
hate his guts.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.440
[Leslie] A hotel employee said

12:14.480 --> 12:15.940
they saw you
driving off with him.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.610
B'y, Leslie b'y.
I don't know what to tell ya.

12:17.650 --> 12:18.650
Luckily,
you can think about it,

12:18.690 --> 12:20.360
and tell me face to face.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.280
I'll be at your place
in a few minutes.

12:25.660 --> 12:28.660
Um, guys.
A bit of a red flag here.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.950
I just found this
in Garrison's pocket.

12:29.990 --> 12:31.290
[Des] That's the bloody
nail file that was

12:31.330 --> 12:34.040
used to kill so many in To Kill a Mocking Man.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.290
You took a potential murder
weapon from a crime scene?

12:36.330 --> 12:38.380
It was just sitting there.
And I thought--

12:38.420 --> 12:39.920
That you would contaminate
evidence?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.420
And make yourself look even
guiltier than you already do?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.090
I thought it might hold a clue.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.640
Unlike you.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.140
And FYI, Leslie's on
her way over here.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.470
Oooh.

12:48.510 --> 12:50.600
Forces are pulling you together.
Can't you feel it?

12:50.640 --> 12:53.020
Garrison, how can you be
so calm right now?

12:53.060 --> 12:54.980
I spent six months
in India.

12:55.020 --> 12:58.230
Meditation,
spiritual soul searching.

12:58.270 --> 12:59.690
A physical

12:59.730 --> 13:02.990
and physiological cleansing,
all incredibly liberating.

13:03.030 --> 13:05.160
Oh, I'll liberate you. Right out
through the friggin' window.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.490
[Rose]
Okay. Des.

13:06.530 --> 13:08.030
I want you to research
Steele's book.

13:08.070 --> 13:09.160
See if there's
any other similarities

13:09.200 --> 13:10.290
to what's happening right now.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.790
Yes. I'll need stickies.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.160
Where are you going?

13:13.200 --> 13:15.370
I gotta go return this
to the scene of the crime.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.920
And you're coming with me.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.130
Give me that!

13:22.590 --> 13:24.590
[Rachel]
Sorry. That was a dead end.

13:24.630 --> 13:26.340
Nancy definitely didn't stay
at my place.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.300
That's okay.
It was worth a try.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.350
Tell me.
Did Nancy get along with Steele?

13:30.890 --> 13:32.180
She seemed to.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.310
I can imagine being
Garrison Steele's assistant

13:34.350 --> 13:36.480
could be difficult at times.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.560
You don't think she robbed the
manuscript and took off?

13:39.610 --> 13:42.070
That would be quite
the severance package.

13:42.110 --> 13:44.610
So, how did you meet Steele?

13:44.650 --> 13:46.400
At a book signing.

13:46.450 --> 13:49.280
I've been reading his stuff
for years.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.660
So your son's the inspiration

13:50.700 --> 13:52.080
for that
Special Detective series?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.790
In Jake's defense, Garrison
did take a few liberties.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.710
To be honest, I don't like the
character's temperament.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.210
Well, Garrison nailed
that part.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.130
Rachel Molloy.

14:01.170 --> 14:02.380
I need to speak to you.

14:02.420 --> 14:03.300
Poppy?

14:37.540 --> 14:38.670
[Jake]
What is wrong with you?

14:38.710 --> 14:39.870
I told you to wait in the car!

14:39.920 --> 14:41.920
I left something important
in here.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.300
Something that showcases
my other talents.

14:44.340 --> 14:45.760
Other talents?

14:45.800 --> 14:48.050
That would imply that you
already possess at least one.

14:48.090 --> 14:49.510
It's a sex tape, okay?

14:49.550 --> 14:51.300
A sex tape?

14:51.340 --> 14:53.680
I thought I could convince
Nancy and Rachel

14:53.720 --> 14:57.480
to participate
in the elusive ménage.

14:57.520 --> 15:01.060
So I set out the stuffed
animal camera to capture

15:01.100 --> 15:02.270
the moment.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.730
Ironic, since you have
a bit of an unwanted

15:04.770 --> 15:06.900
ménage of your own with Leslie
and her husband.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.900
Stop saying the word ménage .

15:08.940 --> 15:10.860
You were gonna tape these girls
without them knowing about it?

15:10.910 --> 15:12.700
No, of course not.
I wouldn't do that.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.160
It would only be
with their consent.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.790
I used the nanny cam so it
wouldn't take anyone

15:16.830 --> 15:18.870
out of the moment.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.790
But I can't remember if we did
anything or not.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.630
Why didn't you tell me that you
had a camera?

15:23.670 --> 15:24.960
You could have taped
everything

15:25.000 --> 15:26.380
that happened here last night,
you idiot.

15:28.170 --> 15:29.260
What is this?

15:29.300 --> 15:30.590
The dust jacket layout
for the new book.

15:31.340 --> 15:32.640
[Jake]
The briefcase.

15:32.680 --> 15:34.010
[Steele] Isn't it beautiful?
Corinthian leather,

15:34.050 --> 15:34.760
given to me by Freddy Mercury.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.810
-The bellhop.
-No. You moron.

15:37.850 --> 15:39.390
The lead singer from Queen.

15:39.430 --> 15:42.230
God. This Leslie thing is really
messing with your brain.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.650
Stop talking.

15:44.690 --> 15:45.730
Let's go.

15:45.770 --> 15:47.530
It's a nice picture of me.

15:51.400 --> 15:54.660
Hello. Well, how nice of you.
Don't be shy.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.700
[Jake] You.
I wanna talk to you.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.910
Come here.

15:59.960 --> 16:00.080
Let go.

16:01.410 --> 16:03.580
Gather 'round. Don't be shy.
I'm just like you.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.750
Let me sign that for you.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.840
Steele. What the
hell are you doing?

16:07.880 --> 16:10.050
-Are you trying to get caught?
-Jake. These are my fans.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.720
[Danielle]
Garrison Steele.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.300
Where is my manuscript?

16:14.550 --> 16:15.640
Isn't that your ex-wife?

16:17.180 --> 16:18.560
Well, that answers that.

16:21.890 --> 16:24.600
Rose. If you know the
whereabouts of Garrison Steele,

16:24.650 --> 16:25.860
you have got to tell me.

16:25.900 --> 16:27.610
I can tell you
that he's not here.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.780
That is not what I asked.

16:29.820 --> 16:31.570
And to say that this is all
a bit much right now,

16:31.610 --> 16:33.610
is probably the understatement
of the century.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.030
Listen, you know what?

16:35.070 --> 16:36.950
I know you're going through
a tough time right now.

16:36.990 --> 16:38.490
And if anyone can empathize

16:38.530 --> 16:41.200
about the return
of an ex-husband, it's me.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.120
At least there was a definite
ending between you and yours.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.750
Well, if you ever need to talk,
I'm here.

16:45.790 --> 16:48.170
[ring]

16:48.210 --> 16:49.090
Bennett.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.550
Okay.
I'm on my way.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.550
-Looks like we got a lead.
-Oh great.

16:55.590 --> 16:57.640
Would you please
tell Jake to call me?

16:57.680 --> 16:59.260
Okay.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.600
We can work this out.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.560
The case, I mean.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.350
I knew what you meant.
Okay. Will do.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.730
Oh. Holy--

17:11.740 --> 17:13.400
Jeez.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.820
I don't know
what you're implying,

17:16.860 --> 17:18.450
but Garrison
would never hurt anyone.

17:18.490 --> 17:20.030
Especially
his own assistant Nancy.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.240
She was guarding
the new manuscript.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.540
He's writing a new book?

17:22.580 --> 17:23.500
It's another one of
that terrible

17:23.540 --> 17:24.500
Special Detective Series.

17:24.540 --> 17:25.790
Terrible?
I've read the series

17:25.830 --> 17:27.290
three times.

17:27.330 --> 17:28.960
[Tinny] Maybe that manuscript
is what this is all about.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.250
Maybe someone tried to
hurt Nancy for it.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.500
Look, I got this, Tinny.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.510
Please. Don't jump to
conclusions, alright?

17:33.550 --> 17:37.010
We don't know if Nancy or
anyone else was actually hurt.

17:37.050 --> 17:39.890
But, that's logical
and well thought out.

17:41.010 --> 17:42.180
[Grayson]
Where's the manuscript now?

17:42.220 --> 17:43.270
[Mal]
We don't know.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.060
And we've been
more than cooperative,

17:45.100 --> 17:47.400
so, if you'll excuse us...?

17:47.440 --> 17:50.320
Yeah, well...
Don't leave the country.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.240
Don't leave the country?

17:54.280 --> 17:56.950
Look. How about you not make
this about us? Okay?

17:56.990 --> 17:57.910
Us?

17:57.950 --> 18:00.990
Grayson.
I broke up with you.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.330
And if you ever bring up that
personal crap again,

18:03.370 --> 18:05.160
I'll get creative when people
ask why it ended.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.330
Don't kid yourself.
It ended because of Des.

18:12.710 --> 18:14.090
[Jake] Just so you know.

18:14.130 --> 18:15.970
You risked getting caught
by the cops over a sex tape.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.880
If you knew how much
time and effort I put into

18:17.930 --> 18:20.260
that ménage à trois plan,
you'd understand.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.140
Yeah, well, you'd better be
careful or your little ménage

18:22.180 --> 18:23.640
will end up
all over the internet.

18:23.680 --> 18:24.600
Well, I hope you find it
educational.

18:24.640 --> 18:25.430
[ring]

18:25.480 --> 18:26.640
[Jake]
Des.

18:26.680 --> 18:27.980
Okay, I think I might know
where Nancy is.

18:28.020 --> 18:29.480
So I scanned through all of
Garrison's books.

18:29.520 --> 18:30.770
And there are three

18:30.810 --> 18:32.320
where there's a writer
and missing assistants.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.270
Three...

18:33.320 --> 18:34.980
There are only so many devices.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.070
And in all three books,
they end up dead.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.990
[Jake] Stashing a body's
a hard thing to do.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.910
So it has to be close to the
scene of the crime.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.700
Are there any assistants
who were killed

18:43.740 --> 18:46.660
and stashed somewhere in any of
Steele's crappy books?

18:46.700 --> 18:48.040
Yeah, well if it's Herd of Murderers,

18:48.080 --> 18:49.620
she could be found on a farm.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.670
Half Past Dead has her
at a recycling depot.

18:51.710 --> 18:53.290
While in Innocent
Until Proven Dead ,

18:53.340 --> 18:55.880
the victim falls from dory after
being stabbed.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.220
Very impressive.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.550
[Jake]
A dory?

18:58.590 --> 19:00.220
Hang on for a sec.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.760
There's a monument right behind

19:03.810 --> 19:05.930
the hotel that has a boat in it.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.940
I'm gonna go check it out.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.160
I don't see her.

19:28.870 --> 19:30.370
Wait a second.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.750
[Steele]
Oh my God. Nancy.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.880
I can't believe this.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.050
It's not good.

19:39.090 --> 19:40.510
[sirens]

19:45.600 --> 19:46.680
[Leslie]
We find you literally

19:46.720 --> 19:48.180
standing over the body.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.930
You're looking at some serious
charges here.

19:49.980 --> 19:52.100
From aiding and abetting
to accessory to murder.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.060
And you lied
to a police officer.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.820
I did not lie.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.610
I simply withheld
some important information,

19:58.650 --> 20:00.150
which you, of all people,
should appreciate.

20:00.190 --> 20:01.990
[Steele] Leslie and Jake. I
understand you're tormented

20:02.030 --> 20:03.740
by the return of a former lover.

20:03.780 --> 20:05.240
I wrote the book on that.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.580
Read Murder Over Martinis.
It will--

20:07.620 --> 20:09.620
[together]
Shut up Steele.

20:09.660 --> 20:10.710
And you're looking
at Murder One.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.420
I didn't kill Nancy.

20:12.460 --> 20:13.790
[Jake]
Whoa, whoa. Wait a--

20:13.830 --> 20:15.710
How did the cops know
where to find us, exactly?

20:15.750 --> 20:17.050
An anonymous tip.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.590
Leslie, think about it.

20:18.630 --> 20:21.800
Whoever killed Nancy probably
called in your little tip.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.840
Okay? They're trying
to frame us.

20:24.550 --> 20:25.640
We can't hold Jake.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.930
See. What?

20:26.970 --> 20:28.680
We're in the middle
of a murder investigation.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.680
Garrison's lawyer called.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.480
And according to
Mr. Steele here,

20:32.520 --> 20:35.560
the entire thing
was against Doyle's will.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.110
I will sign an affidavit,

20:37.150 --> 20:39.690
that I took the Doyles hostage
at gun point.

20:39.730 --> 20:42.150
I was more animal than man.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.910
Steele is clearly lying.

20:43.950 --> 20:44.950
[Steele]
What?

20:44.990 --> 20:46.450
Don't shoot the messenger.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.660
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

20:51.700 --> 20:53.290
I promise you two that.

20:54.540 --> 20:57.080
Jake. Please.
You're my only hope.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.710
I'll try and figure out
who killed Nancy.

20:58.750 --> 20:59.800
And who's trying to frame you.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.300
But you have to promise--

21:02.340 --> 21:03.550
to stop lying to me.

21:03.590 --> 21:04.760
What? I'm not--

21:04.800 --> 21:05.840
You know what?

21:05.890 --> 21:08.260
You can start
by not talking at all.

21:12.680 --> 21:13.520
Callum.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.310
What are you doing here?

21:15.350 --> 21:17.270
I was just finishing up
some paper work.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.440
It's official.
I'm alive again.

21:19.730 --> 21:21.610
So, look. I'm really
sorry about this morning.

21:23.030 --> 21:25.490
The last thing in the world
I wanna do is upset you.

21:25.530 --> 21:26.490
I've done
enough of that already.

21:26.530 --> 21:28.320
Thanks for that.

21:28.370 --> 21:29.660
I just need a bit more time.

21:29.700 --> 21:31.910
So, for now--

21:31.950 --> 21:34.330
Congratulations on your return
to the land of the living.

21:37.710 --> 21:38.590
So what are we celebrating?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.750
Just getting my life
back in order.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.920
I'm so happy for you.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.010
I'll talk to you later.

21:45.050 --> 21:46.180
Absolutely.

21:51.890 --> 21:54.600
Jake. I don't know where to
start. This is a mess.

21:55.690 --> 21:57.770
I'm sure it will all
work itself out.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.610
And, just so we're clear--

22:01.860 --> 22:03.740
I'm gonna find out the truth
about Steele.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.070
Okay.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.330
[Jake]
Des.

22:11.370 --> 22:12.120
I need you
to look into this.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.330
Over there, please.

22:13.370 --> 22:15.200
-Why? What's on it?
-It's either evidence.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.960
Or something that's gonna scar
you for the rest of your life.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.380
So what have we got?

22:20.420 --> 22:22.250
[Mal] We know that someone
has framed Garrison

22:22.290 --> 22:24.000
for the murder
of his assistant, Nancy.

22:24.050 --> 22:26.170
Right. And they're doing it in a
style mimicking Steele's novels.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.590
Well, for the only copy

22:27.630 --> 22:30.390
of Garrison Steele's
next Special Detective novel,

22:30.430 --> 22:31.680
Clueless in St. John's.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.810
-Great title.
-I agree.

22:32.850 --> 22:34.600
-Yeah, me too.
-Just shut up, all of ye.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.980
[Mal] This manuscript
is worth a fortune.

22:36.020 --> 22:37.430
Steele's ex-wife and publisher

22:37.480 --> 22:39.810
has been after Steele for
a book he owes her.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.360
Maybe she killed Nancy to get
her hands on the manuscript.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.190
And Rachel Molloy,
Steele's girlfriend,

22:44.230 --> 22:45.530
was found
with him at the scene.

22:45.570 --> 22:47.280
Well, you know,
either Rachel, or Danielle

22:47.320 --> 22:48.070
could have wanted
Nancy out of the way.

22:48.110 --> 22:49.490
It's a motive.

22:49.530 --> 22:51.070
Okay. Well, also there's Zach
Fleming, the bellhop,

22:51.110 --> 22:53.580
who stole Steele's briefcase,
presumably for the manuscript.

22:53.620 --> 22:55.660
Okay. That's odd.
Like really odd.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.120
[Jake] Really odd,
like, we've gotta

22:57.160 --> 22:58.750
stare at Garrison Steele
naked odd?

22:58.790 --> 23:00.040
Or something else?

23:02.210 --> 23:03.090
Just rewind that.

23:04.420 --> 23:07.420
Look. She put something in
Steele's briefcase.

23:07.470 --> 23:08.760
[Mal]
You thinking what I'm thinking?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.180
That's real Corinthian leather.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.220
It's the manuscript.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.180
That too.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.140
Nancy must have put it in there

23:14.180 --> 23:15.520
without telling Steele.

23:15.560 --> 23:16.470
So the bellhop--

23:16.520 --> 23:17.600
Zach. He's got it.

23:18.310 --> 23:19.270
You got an address?

23:19.310 --> 23:20.600
I can text you one right now.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.360
Come on.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.980
This is weird.

23:25.020 --> 23:26.820
The evidence
is really piling up.

23:26.860 --> 23:28.780
In addition to the obvious--

23:28.820 --> 23:30.610
the murder being in your suite.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.450
And your prints being
on the murder weapon.

23:32.490 --> 23:33.660
An oversight on my part.

23:33.700 --> 23:35.660
The victim's body was staged

23:35.700 --> 23:38.660
to look like a scene
from one your books.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.250
That means it was premeditated.

23:41.290 --> 23:43.340
Leslie--
I'm not a killer.

23:44.590 --> 23:47.210
I have no motive.
I have everything to lose.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.880
And nothing to gain.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.880
Say I believe you.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.760
Do you have any idea
who'd wanna frame you?

23:52.800 --> 23:55.010
No. People love me.

23:56.010 --> 23:57.430
Don't they?

23:57.470 --> 23:58.720
[Danielle] [muffled]
I really need to see him.

23:58.770 --> 23:59.890
[Tinny]
You can't go in there.

24:01.770 --> 24:04.480
I really need
to speak to Garrison.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.020
I told you.
You can't go in there.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.020
If you keep this up,
I'm gonna

24:07.070 --> 24:08.440
have to place you under arrest.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.400
What's going on?

24:10.440 --> 24:13.320
I'm Danielle Roberts. Garrison's
ex-wife and publisher.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.450
I'd like to see him.

24:14.490 --> 24:17.120
I told her
she couldn't go in there.

24:17.160 --> 24:18.290
You can see him
in a few minutes.

24:18.330 --> 24:19.370
Thank you.

24:20.950 --> 24:23.580
So we're allowing visitors in
the interrogation room now?

24:23.620 --> 24:24.330
I don't think
Steele's a murderer.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.170
And she's gonna help me
find out who is.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.170
I will get you your manuscript.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.180
The manuscript
is half of what I want.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.220
You stole from me.

24:35.260 --> 24:36.180
Oh that.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.640
Yes that.

24:37.680 --> 24:40.560
You drained my accounts.
Eighty thousand dollars.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.520
I needed the cash
to maintain the lifestyle

24:44.560 --> 24:47.570
in which I have
become accustomed.

24:47.610 --> 24:48.650
But I've changed.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.070
I have a plan for you

24:50.110 --> 24:52.990
to get back the money
you owe me. And more.

24:53.030 --> 24:54.360
Have you checked the internet?

24:54.410 --> 24:59.160
I don't do that stuff.
The twitting or the facing.

24:59.660 --> 25:00.620
Why?

25:00.660 --> 25:02.750
News of your arrest has leaked.

25:02.790 --> 25:03.920
Your novels are flying
off the shelves.

25:05.540 --> 25:08.590
Pre-sales for your new book are
also going through the roof.

25:08.630 --> 25:11.510
I don't care about such shallow
pursuits of happiness.

25:11.550 --> 25:15.140
That's all you care about.
We were married, remember?

25:15.680 --> 25:16.840
Good point.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.640
There are millions of dollars
on the line.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.350
I could do a lot of good
with that kind of money.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.770
-But the manuscript is gone.
-Not quite.

25:26.520 --> 25:28.480
It's for sale
on an online auction.

25:29.730 --> 25:33.400
And I've already contacted
the supplier.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.740
We're meeting on the rooftop
of your hotel.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.700
But you could be talking
to the killer.

25:40.870 --> 25:44.920
I'll take care of it,
like I always do.

25:47.670 --> 25:48.880
How did you know
that would work?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.380
Volatile relationship combined
with close space--

25:53.300 --> 25:55.050
Always gets information flowing.

25:55.090 --> 25:56.680
Tell Grayson
to move Steele to prison holding

25:56.720 --> 25:58.180
to avoid the press.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.350
Gladly.

25:59.390 --> 26:00.640
Tinny--

26:00.680 --> 26:02.640
Do I need to think about
keeping you guys apart?

26:02.680 --> 26:03.600
What?

26:03.640 --> 26:05.560
You and Grayson.
You were dating.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.940
No. We're just colleagues now.

26:07.980 --> 26:09.560
We're keeping it
totally professional.

26:10.310 --> 26:12.070
Okay. Great.

26:12.110 --> 26:13.690
Then look into this auction
and keep me posted.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.150
Yes sergeant.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.030
Your chariot, sir.

26:21.160 --> 26:25.200
I-- I never thought that I would
be transporting one of my idols.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.330
Oh you're so kind.
Tell me your name.

26:27.370 --> 26:29.460
-Grayson.
-Grayson, Grayson.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.710
It is always such a pleasure
to meet a fan.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.550
In fact, I'd love to give you
an autograph. But alas--

26:34.590 --> 26:37.720
Oh, sorry. I can't. I wish.
But rules are rules.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.260
I understand.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.010
That is what
is wrong with society.

26:41.050 --> 26:42.430
Best not do that.

26:42.470 --> 26:45.600
Right. I shouldn't waste
my breath on such reprobates.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.980
But tell me something--

26:47.020 --> 26:51.310
How do you sleep at night?
I assume it's in caves.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.150
You--
troglodytes.

26:54.190 --> 26:56.070
Hey. I'm warning you.
Go back inside.

26:56.860 --> 26:59.910
Guys! I am warning you.

27:01.070 --> 27:02.780
Yeah. Keep moving.

27:03.620 --> 27:04.950
I'm sorry about that Mr.--

27:06.080 --> 27:07.000
Steele.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.330
Mr. Steele?

27:13.750 --> 27:16.170
B'y, ythink for a fella working
in the hospitality industry,

27:16.210 --> 27:19.220
this guy would be
a little bit neater.

27:19.260 --> 27:22.220
So how are you holding up?

27:22.260 --> 27:23.890
I'm fine. Okay? I'm fine.

27:23.930 --> 27:25.600
So, whatever you're thinking,
just drop it.

27:25.640 --> 27:29.100
Likely not easy seeing Leslie
and Callum together like that.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.770
No. It wasn't easy.
In In fact--

27:31.810 --> 27:34.360
If you really wanna
know the truth,

27:34.400 --> 27:36.150
it kinda took the wind outa me.

27:36.190 --> 27:37.110
I can imagine.

27:37.150 --> 27:38.070
But you're gonna be okay.

27:38.110 --> 27:39.030
I know it.

27:39.070 --> 27:40.780
[Jake]
Look at this.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.740
GHB.

27:42.950 --> 27:43.910
[Mal]
Zach must have used this

27:43.950 --> 27:45.740
to drug Garrison and Rachel.

27:45.780 --> 27:48.080
Obviously
he's a Garrison Steele fan.

27:48.120 --> 27:49.580
Maybe he couldn't wait
to get his hands on

27:49.620 --> 27:50.790
Steele's latest novel.

27:50.830 --> 27:51.790
Huh.

27:51.830 --> 27:52.880
Hear that?

27:54.880 --> 27:56.500
Rachel.

27:56.550 --> 27:58.340
What's with the hammer? You
planning on doing some renos?

27:58.380 --> 28:01.800
I just thought that if I could
find Garrison's manuscript,

28:01.840 --> 28:03.510
I could help
prove his innocence.

28:03.550 --> 28:05.350
How'd you know Zach had
the manuscript?

28:05.390 --> 28:07.470
Given the murderer's M.O.
I thought:

28:07.510 --> 28:09.270
What was another
Garrison Steele book

28:09.310 --> 28:11.810
involving writers
and missing items?

28:11.850 --> 28:13.230
Dead Sexy.

28:13.270 --> 28:14.440
Is there a bell hop in that one?

28:14.480 --> 28:16.480
A maid, but--

28:16.520 --> 28:17.820
I remember Zach from last night.

28:17.860 --> 28:19.490
[phone rings]

28:20.690 --> 28:22.740
-What do you want?
-I found the manuscript.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.870
Zach seems to be selling it
on an on-line auction.

28:24.910 --> 28:26.200
Now I tracked the metadata

28:26.240 --> 28:27.910
from the photo attached to
the auction to find a

28:27.950 --> 28:30.620
time, date and location of when
the image was taken.

28:30.660 --> 28:32.000
I have no idea
what any of that means.

28:32.040 --> 28:33.420
-Where is he?
-The picture was taken

28:33.460 --> 28:34.790
at the hotel
that Garrison is staying at.

28:34.830 --> 28:36.670
Do you wanna know what I did
then? Do ya, do ya?

28:36.710 --> 28:38.000
Des. Shut up and tell me.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.960
I mean, don't shut up,
but tell me. Just tell me.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.970
Okay, well Zach is an employee.
So he has a swipe card.

28:43.010 --> 28:45.140
So I accessed
the hotel's key pass system

28:45.180 --> 28:47.180
to find out exactly
where he last used it.

28:47.220 --> 28:49.310
And it was the roof.
And he hasn't used it since.

28:49.350 --> 28:50.310
He should still be there.

28:50.350 --> 28:51.890
-Great work.
-Yeah. Good work.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.310
I'm coming with you.

28:53.350 --> 28:56.560
We should drop you off home
first. Just to be safe.

29:03.030 --> 29:04.070
[Mal]
Steele?

29:07.450 --> 29:08.450
It happened again.

29:08.490 --> 29:09.370
Is that---?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.080
-Zach.
-This is right out of your book.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.710
Tic Tack Dead .

29:18.210 --> 29:19.550
[Mal] You escaped custody?

29:19.590 --> 29:20.710
I was desperate.

29:20.750 --> 29:21.670
To what?
Kill this guy?

29:21.710 --> 29:23.220
He was dead when I arrived.

29:23.260 --> 29:25.550
That seems to be
a common theme with you.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.050
Why did you come back
to the hotel?

29:27.090 --> 29:29.260
Danielle told me she was meeting
the seller on the rooftop.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.010
You don't think she's
responsible, do you?

29:31.060 --> 29:33.060
It's possible. Jake.
What have we got?

29:33.100 --> 29:35.350
Obviously,
he was in some kind of scrap.

29:35.390 --> 29:36.900
He was bashed
in the back of the head

29:36.940 --> 29:39.230
and apparently choked at the
same time afterwards.

29:39.270 --> 29:40.690
There was a serious
scuffle here.

29:40.730 --> 29:41.820
Zach's clothes are ripped.

29:41.860 --> 29:44.700
Unfortunately--

29:44.740 --> 29:46.360
Steele looks like
a stick of gum.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.200
He obviously wasn't
in any kind of fight.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.660
See, I told you.
And by the way--

29:49.700 --> 29:52.160
Thank you.
I do my best.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.410
It's a woman's earring.
Let me guess.

29:55.460 --> 29:58.040
Is this a clue from one of your
brilliant books.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.130
No.

29:59.170 --> 30:00.090
Dad, I got a feeling

30:00.130 --> 30:01.710
our killer might be a woman.

30:01.750 --> 30:03.210
What do you got?

30:03.260 --> 30:04.380
It's a page from my manuscript.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.760
[Jake] A photocopy.
So he was selling

30:08.800 --> 30:10.680
a photocopy of the book.
Not the original.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.100
So where's the original
manuscript?

30:12.140 --> 30:13.930
-[siren]
-Cops.

30:13.970 --> 30:16.060
They probably figured it out,
about the on-line auction.

30:16.100 --> 30:17.560
Okay.
We gotta get out of here.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.570
[click. Click]

30:23.320 --> 30:23.990
[Steele]
We're stuck.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.200
Zach's got a pass key
in his pocket here.

30:28.820 --> 30:30.450
[Mal]
Jake. Hurry up!

30:33.240 --> 30:35.250
Who in God's name
are you calling now?

30:35.290 --> 30:36.660
[Mal]
Son, come on.

30:36.710 --> 30:37.080
Yeah, Des.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.920
What rooms did Zach access with
his pass key at the hotel?

30:46.170 --> 30:48.550
It doesn't look like this room's
been used for a while.

30:48.590 --> 30:50.640
A great place to lay low.

30:54.310 --> 30:57.600
Des said that Zach accessed this
room a bunch of times.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.020
I don't see the manuscript.

31:04.940 --> 31:07.030
Nineteen forty nine.

31:16.870 --> 31:17.830
My opus.

31:23.170 --> 31:24.920
[Des] Okay, so.
Our killer is female.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.920
And has already referenced Innocent Until Proven Dead,

31:26.960 --> 31:28.630
To Kill a Mocking Man.
and Tic Tack Dead.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.220
Basically, the classics.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.550
All of those books, by the way,
are selling like hotcakes

31:32.590 --> 31:34.220
ever since word got out
about Steele.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.220
Which might be the reason
Danielle committed these crimes.

31:36.260 --> 31:38.640
She did tell me she was going to
parlay the arrest

31:38.680 --> 31:40.140
into making my new Special Detective novel

31:40.190 --> 31:41.650
a massive seller.

31:41.690 --> 31:43.730
And Danielle did claim to be
meeting Zach on the rooftop

31:43.770 --> 31:44.940
to buy the manuscript.

31:44.980 --> 31:47.110
You know, maybe, just maybe,
she wanted it,

31:47.150 --> 31:47.860
but she wasn't
willing to pay for it.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.150
It happened to me once--

31:49.190 --> 31:50.700
with a bunch of Atari
Twenty Six Hundred tapes.

31:50.740 --> 31:53.450
-Uh... Just...
-What?

31:55.030 --> 31:58.660
Any luck with Zach? That website
he was using to sell this--

32:00.460 --> 32:02.210
-masterpiece?
-[Rose] Yeah.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.420
Turns out that the auction
winner is someone named CFA.

32:04.460 --> 32:05.790
So I did a little digging.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.670
And it turns out that CFA
is associated with

32:07.710 --> 32:09.670
an email address for one
Danielle Roberts.

32:09.710 --> 32:12.050
But none of Garrison's books
had the publisher do it.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.680
B'ys. Do we really think
that Danielle

32:13.720 --> 32:15.140
would frame Steele
for murder?

32:15.180 --> 32:17.060
I mean, she'd be putting her
golden goose in jeopardy.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.100
[phone message sound]

32:20.560 --> 32:21.480
Everything okay?

32:21.520 --> 32:21.600
I'll be back.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.400
So, if Danielle took the
manuscript from Zach,

32:25.440 --> 32:26.690
only to find out
it was a photocopy,

32:26.730 --> 32:27.650
where would she go next?

32:27.690 --> 32:28.610
[Des]
Good question.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.280
-Zach's house.
-Zach's house.

32:30.320 --> 32:31.700
We almost said it
the exact same time.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.200
Okay, come on Garrison--

32:33.360 --> 32:35.200
-He's gone.
-And so is the manuscript.

32:40.950 --> 32:43.120
I thought it was about time
you and I had a little talk.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.130
You are literally
the last person

32:46.170 --> 32:48.500
that I need to be
dealing with right now.

32:48.550 --> 32:49.920
So--Go away.

32:49.960 --> 32:53.260
Look. I know you and Leslie
had a relationship.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.090
But I'm here now.
And I want my life back.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.180
And that includes my wife.

32:59.810 --> 33:00.720
I don't know what it is

33:00.770 --> 33:02.310
about you, Callum.

33:02.350 --> 33:03.690
But I don't trust you.

33:03.730 --> 33:04.980
And I know what you're thinking.
Maybe it's jealousy.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.190
Maybe I want Leslie so bad that
I'm willing to look at you

33:10.230 --> 33:13.530
and see whatever I need to,
to make you the bad guy.

33:13.570 --> 33:15.200
The thought had crossed my mind,
yeah.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.120
I know you're up to something.

33:17.580 --> 33:21.450
And whatever it is,
if it involves hurting Leslie--

33:22.620 --> 33:25.330
You'll wish you'd never
laid eyes on me.

33:25.370 --> 33:28.090
Why don't we let Leslie decide
what's right for Leslie?

33:29.040 --> 33:30.960
I think I've made myself clear.

33:33.260 --> 33:34.550
Steele.

33:34.590 --> 33:36.380
Ooh. Gentlemen.

33:36.430 --> 33:38.600
I have to apologize
for my behavior earlier today.

33:38.640 --> 33:43.140
But you see, I needed a little
distraction to make my getaway,

33:43.180 --> 33:45.890
which, I'm sure you of all
people can understand.

33:45.940 --> 33:48.770
So, let me squeeze by, guys.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.990
Okay. I don't know what Steele
did to you.

33:56.030 --> 33:57.910
I'm sure it was really annoying.

33:57.950 --> 34:00.740
But I kinda need him in one
piece. Alright?

34:01.700 --> 34:02.580
[punch]

34:04.500 --> 34:05.790
Now, now, that wasn't very--

34:05.830 --> 34:06.750
[punch]

34:07.710 --> 34:08.580
[punch]

34:11.880 --> 34:14.050
Instigator rule.
Can't have a third man in.

34:15.010 --> 34:15.880
[punch]

34:18.800 --> 34:19.680
[punch]

34:24.270 --> 34:25.980
So what are we? Like, the Duke
boys or something now?

34:27.810 --> 34:28.940
What's going on?

34:28.980 --> 34:29.900
Leslie.

34:29.940 --> 34:32.690
-Where's Steele?
-He's--

34:36.450 --> 34:37.530
Unbelievable.

34:39.700 --> 34:41.410
[Leslie] So you don't know
Steele's whereabouts.

34:41.450 --> 34:42.530
Honestly,

34:42.580 --> 34:43.830
Leslie, this time.
I don't have a clue.

34:43.870 --> 34:45.200
Well that's appropriate.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.250
Seeing as it's the title of
his new book for you.

34:47.290 --> 34:48.540
[laughs]

34:48.580 --> 34:50.920
And you two hang out now?

34:50.960 --> 34:52.420
Well, they were causing
a disturbance--

34:52.460 --> 34:54.340
So I was just giving
Jake here a little help.

34:54.380 --> 34:55.300
I did not need his help.

34:55.340 --> 34:56.130
Yes he did.

34:56.170 --> 34:57.420
Don't kid yourself.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.260
Great. Well, I need to take
these two guys in.

35:01.680 --> 35:05.140
And you and me. Jake.
We need to talk. Tonight.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.100
Back here.

35:06.140 --> 35:07.020
I'd love that.

35:08.060 --> 35:09.640
I would love that.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.610
It's looking like Danielle
Roberts, Garrison's publisher,

35:11.650 --> 35:12.690
is behind this.

35:12.730 --> 35:13.320
There's something else
going on here.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.480
We gotta find out.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.860
She's probably
at Zach's place right now,

35:15.900 --> 35:17.570
-looking for the manuscript.
-Des, you go upstairs

35:17.610 --> 35:19.200
and go through
all Garrison Steele's books

35:19.240 --> 35:20.700
and see if you can find
anything else.

35:23.240 --> 35:26.540
Can you believe
that Leslie was married--

35:26.580 --> 35:29.040
And she didn't even tell Jake.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.630
Oh right...

35:32.040 --> 35:33.250
I should probably go.

35:38.630 --> 35:40.470
[Mal] If you're looking for the
manuscript, it's not here.

35:40.510 --> 35:41.680
What?

35:41.720 --> 35:43.390
Where is it?
I deserve it.

35:43.430 --> 35:44.810
Steele owes me thousands.

35:46.430 --> 35:48.100
[Jake]
Wait a minute.

35:48.930 --> 35:50.350
Is this earring a clip on?

35:52.310 --> 35:54.520
So I don't have pierced ears.
Is that okay with you?

35:54.570 --> 35:55.770
Whoever murdered Zach

35:55.820 --> 35:57.190
left a real earring
at the scene.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.490
It must have been
from a struggle.

35:58.530 --> 35:59.450
We've got the wrong person.

35:59.490 --> 36:00.990
[phone rings]

36:02.740 --> 36:06.030
Yeah, Des. Turns out Danielle
might not be the murderer.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.290
What? No. All the books point to
the ex-wife being responsible.

36:09.330 --> 36:10.670
The signs are overwhelming,
Jake. They're overwhelming .

36:11.460 --> 36:12.880
Maybe it's a frame job.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.330
Dead Sexy.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.340
You think I'm dead sexy?

36:15.380 --> 36:17.170
Wow. Thank you.

36:17.210 --> 36:18.130
[Jake] Steele's book.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.550
Dead Sexy.

36:19.590 --> 36:21.380
That's how Rachel knew
about Zach--

36:21.430 --> 36:22.970
Because of the maid in the book.

36:23.010 --> 36:25.140
Oh right, right right. No. No!
There's no maid in Dead Sexy.

36:25.180 --> 36:26.430
Are you sure?

36:26.470 --> 36:27.930
Do you really need me to answer
that question?

36:29.020 --> 36:30.100
That means--

36:30.140 --> 36:31.600
It has to be Rachel.

36:31.640 --> 36:33.940
Her proximity to Steele,
to Nancy...

36:33.980 --> 36:35.230
Plus the whole earring thing.

36:35.270 --> 36:36.900
She looked pretty comfortable
with that hammer.

36:36.940 --> 36:38.690
Des. We think it's Rachel.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.320
Do you have any idea
where we could find her?

36:40.360 --> 36:42.240
According to Tinker, Taylor,
Soldier, Dead,

36:42.280 --> 36:43.490
the only other book
in Steele's collection

36:43.530 --> 36:44.780
that fits the pattern,

36:44.820 --> 36:46.450
Garrison should be at a hotel.

36:46.490 --> 36:48.700
Jake, that's where the writer
in the book gets killed.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.200
-[message sound]
-I gotta go.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.500
I got a text from Steele.
He's at the hotel.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.590
[thud]

37:02.630 --> 37:03.510
Steele!

37:04.090 --> 37:04.970
[Steele moans]

37:05.800 --> 37:07.220
[Mal]
Steele.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.850
Um, Dad.

37:11.890 --> 37:14.940
I got a really bad feeling
about this.

37:14.980 --> 37:16.520
This isn't from that book--
What's it called?

37:16.560 --> 37:18.110
Tinker, Taylor, Soldier Dead?

37:20.360 --> 37:21.110
This is from The Special Detective .

37:22.190 --> 37:25.110
You read it?
I knew you were a fan.

37:25.150 --> 37:27.320
I mean, she's not after Steele.
She's after me.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.990
This whole thing is a--

37:29.030 --> 37:30.870
[Rachel]
Set up?

37:31.750 --> 37:32.160
Not bad.

37:33.660 --> 37:35.710
Maybe you're not as dumb as
the character in the book.

37:40.130 --> 37:41.800
[Steele] My love.
What are you doing?

37:41.840 --> 37:42.760
[Rachel]
Protecting you.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.260
And your reputation.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.640
Protecting me from what?

37:46.930 --> 37:47.890
From me.

37:47.930 --> 37:48.850
[Rachel]
That's right.

37:48.890 --> 37:50.220
You know what he's done to you?

37:50.260 --> 37:51.640
Jake hasn't done
anything to him.

37:51.680 --> 37:52.890
[Rachel]
Oh shut up. He has.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.020
Have you read Steele's
earlier books?

37:56.060 --> 37:57.270
They were brilliant.

37:57.310 --> 37:58.650
To Kill a Murderer.

37:58.690 --> 37:59.940
Six Six Six O'clock,

37:59.980 --> 38:01.730
Death by Innocence.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.610
And then you came along.

38:03.650 --> 38:05.030
And ruined everything.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.860
The Special Detective?

38:06.910 --> 38:08.530
[Rachel]
It's terrible. It's awful.

38:08.570 --> 38:09.870
And people buy it.

38:09.910 --> 38:12.740
So Steele has to write that crap
to make a living.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.410
You made him a clown.

38:14.450 --> 38:17.960
In all fairness, Steele was a
clown long before he met me.

38:18.000 --> 38:19.710
And actually,
I hate those books too.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.920
Jake.
Jake Doyle might be crap.

38:21.960 --> 38:23.460
But my books certainly are not.

38:23.500 --> 38:25.050
[Rachel] Oh they are. And
I tried to dissuade you.

38:26.590 --> 38:29.800
I tried to make your old books
valuable again. And I did.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.050
But then YOU--

38:31.100 --> 38:32.310
still tried to sell this.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.690
That's the only copy
in existence.

38:37.560 --> 38:39.900
The Special Detective
manuscript.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.150
Now I know what I have to do.

38:42.860 --> 38:45.070
What we have to do.

38:45.610 --> 38:47.240
Destroy it.

38:47.280 --> 38:48.660
And then we kill him.

38:51.410 --> 38:52.280
Do it.

38:54.830 --> 38:56.870
[Jake]
Can I make a suggestion?

38:59.000 --> 38:59.920
Garrison's toy gun.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.540
[Jake]
Exactly.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.090
I mean, if you're going
to kill me,

39:03.130 --> 39:04.670
I'd love to die
knowing that I

39:04.710 --> 39:07.680
burnt that terrible
piece of garbage.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.090
Jake, no.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.300
[click]

39:10.340 --> 39:11.470
May I?

39:20.770 --> 39:21.810
Nice work son.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.900
Actually,
I was aiming for the book.

39:34.160 --> 39:34.830
Oh hey.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.040
I'm gut founded.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.750
So I'm just going to
get a quick bite to eat,

39:37.790 --> 39:39.210
and then off to see Garrison.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.880
Are you okay?

39:43.920 --> 39:45.800
Where are my manners?
Do you want something?

39:49.010 --> 39:50.970
What's going on?

39:55.430 --> 39:57.270
Tinny. I--

39:57.310 --> 39:59.060
Shut up.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.400
[Steele]
I owe you Doyles a lot.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.490
[Jake]
No worries, Steele.

40:11.530 --> 40:13.070
Payment will be payment enough.

40:13.110 --> 40:14.700
I can hardly wait
to read the new book.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.280
Wonderful segue.

40:16.330 --> 40:19.370
I was hoping that
a certain someone,

40:19.410 --> 40:21.410
crucial to breaking
this case wide open,

40:21.460 --> 40:25.080
would write the foreword.
Someone--

40:25.130 --> 40:29.460
who actually helped spawn the
entire Special Detective Series.

40:29.510 --> 40:31.550
Malachy,
would you considered it?

40:32.720 --> 40:35.100
[Mal] Garrison-- Let
me think about it.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.720
[Rose]
He'll do it.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.470
We should go downstairs
and celebrate. Garrison?

40:38.510 --> 40:41.230
I'd love to, but I have a dinner
engagement with Danielle.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.190
A flame has been rekindled.

40:43.230 --> 40:44.190
Good for you.

40:44.230 --> 40:45.690
Let's hope.

40:45.730 --> 40:46.940
Always a pleasure.

40:46.980 --> 40:49.440
Wonderful to see you Rose.
Malachy.

40:49.900 --> 40:50.820
Garrison.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.330
So, Steele. Another
adventure comes to an end.

41:01.370 --> 41:03.210
Hmmm.

41:03.250 --> 41:05.080
Jake. Let me offer you one last
piece of advice.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.710
Oh great.
This'll be good.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.340
I know love when I see it.

41:12.130 --> 41:17.260
Unfortunately, for me, it's
always been the fleeting kind.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.310
But I see something more when
you and Leslie are together.

41:19.350 --> 41:20.600
Something...

41:20.640 --> 41:23.350
that has eluded me
my entire life.

41:23.890 --> 41:25.100
What's that?

41:25.150 --> 41:26.650
The perfect ending.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.480
'Til next time.

41:30.110 --> 41:31.400
[message sound]

41:36.490 --> 41:38.330
Yes, I will.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.540
[ring]

41:40.580 --> 41:41.870
Sloan? You okay?

41:41.910 --> 41:44.960
Jake. I need your help.
I did something terrible.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.120
I'm so sorry.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.250
Where are you?

41:48.290 --> 41:49.210
Your house.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.210
Alright. I'm on my way.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.080
Is that seat taken?

42:27.750 --> 42:28.960
No.

42:31.000 --> 42:32.380
I guess not.

42:36.380 --> 42:39.350
So, maybe we could start
at the beginning.

42:40.430 --> 42:44.640
I'm Callum.
And you are beautiful.
