¶ ¶

00:19.579 --> 00:22.046
(bell rings)

00:23.783 --> 00:26.517
How may I he...?

00:27.787 --> 00:29.354
Devil's night.

00:29.356 --> 00:31.422
I have a standing reservation.

00:31.424 --> 00:33.925
Of course, Mr. Ramirez.

00:33.927 --> 00:37.028
Well, my pleasure to welcome you
to the Hotel Cortez.

00:37.030 --> 00:38.629
Uh, this is your
second year joining us?

00:38.631 --> 00:39.630
Third.

00:39.632 --> 00:41.666
I died in 2013.

00:41.668 --> 00:43.334
(laughs):
Apologies.

00:43.336 --> 00:45.103
Let me show you
to your room.

00:45.105 --> 00:47.171
(elevator bell dings)
RAMIREZ: I was hoping Manson
could join us this year.

00:47.173 --> 00:50.608
LIZ:
Charlie hasn't shuffled
off this mortal coil yet.

00:50.610 --> 00:53.378
He's still serving
life in State prison.

00:53.380 --> 00:54.879
Aw, that's too bad.

00:54.881 --> 00:56.481
Your room, sir.

00:56.483 --> 00:59.650
The master has left
a couple of treats

00:59.652 --> 01:02.020
on the pillow.

01:02.022 --> 01:03.254
I don't need a key.

01:24.044 --> 01:26.377
¶ ¶

01:47.033 --> 01:48.499
(grunts)

01:50.070 --> 01:52.103
(screams)
(shushes)

01:52.105 --> 01:54.038
Shut up!

01:54.040 --> 01:55.440
Swear to Satan you won't scream

01:55.442 --> 01:58.109
or I'll kill you.

01:58.111 --> 01:59.277
(muffled grunts)

01:59.279 --> 02:00.945
I said swear to Satan!

02:00.947 --> 02:04.282
I swear to Satan.

02:04.284 --> 02:06.117
(screaming)

02:06.119 --> 02:08.086
You liar!

02:10.723 --> 02:12.290
No! (coughing)

02:12.292 --> 02:14.258
(mumbling)

02:15.562 --> 02:16.794
(crackling)

02:18.865 --> 02:20.698
Help! Help me!

02:20.700 --> 02:24.035
There's a killer after me!

02:24.037 --> 02:25.369
And a killer before you.

02:26.773 --> 02:29.073
Ricky!

02:29.075 --> 02:31.142
Found your presents.

02:31.144 --> 02:32.743
Tourists from Arizona.

02:32.745 --> 02:34.712
Marriot was full.

02:34.714 --> 02:37.815
Come, finish her off.
(whimpers)

03:49.822 --> 03:52.256
(phone ringing)

03:59.966 --> 04:01.199
Hello?

04:01.201 --> 04:02.400
Hey, Dad.

04:02.402 --> 04:03.734
Hey, sweetie.

04:03.736 --> 04:06.270
Hey.

04:09.042 --> 04:11.242
How was Disneyland?

04:11.244 --> 04:13.244
It's pretty cool.

04:13.246 --> 04:15.246
I was just on my way out.

04:15.248 --> 04:16.881
Uh, I'll be over at Grandma's
in about an hour.

04:16.883 --> 04:20.218
We've got some
Halloween shopping to do.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.386
I don't really feel like

04:22.388 --> 04:24.055
going trick-or-treating
this year.

04:24.057 --> 04:26.057
Oh, um, okay.

04:26.059 --> 04:28.259
We can do something else.

04:28.261 --> 04:29.193
Actually,

04:29.195 --> 04:30.428
Grandma was gonna teach me

04:30.430 --> 04:32.063
how to make banana cream pie.

04:32.065 --> 04:33.864
Kind of takes a while.

04:33.866 --> 04:35.766
Oh, you want to stay
over there for a lit...

04:35.768 --> 04:36.867
a little while longer?

04:36.869 --> 04:38.169
If that's okay.

04:38.171 --> 04:40.104
Look, things are a little bit...

04:40.106 --> 04:41.672
(bubbling nearby)

04:41.674 --> 04:45.009
...weird right now, aren't they?

04:45.011 --> 04:47.411
A little bit.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.447
I got to go.

04:49.449 --> 04:51.449
Bye, Dad.

04:51.451 --> 04:53.050
Bye, Scar.

04:53.052 --> 04:55.319
I love you.

05:07.467 --> 05:10.101
(blood dripping rapidly)

05:22.248 --> 05:23.948
(gasps)

05:32.292 --> 05:35.826
BOY:
<i> I don't like my costume.</i>

05:44.270 --> 05:46.904
Come along, Albert.

05:51.244 --> 05:53.678
Here, put this on.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.279
I don't like my costume.

05:55.281 --> 05:58.516
Nothing's good enough
for you, Mr. Bellyache.

06:00.653 --> 06:02.286
There are places
in the country where they

06:02.288 --> 06:03.521
put paper bags over
the children's head

06:03.523 --> 06:05.089
and call that a costume.

06:05.091 --> 06:07.325
Shake a leg.

06:07.327 --> 06:09.527
I like to be punctual.

06:09.529 --> 06:11.429
(laughing):
Well...

06:11.431 --> 06:13.364
look at you, Molly Wilkins!

06:13.366 --> 06:16.267
You must've been
sewing for months!

06:16.269 --> 06:19.603
Pulled out all the stops, didn't
you, with that expensive lace?

06:19.605 --> 06:23.541
Oh, goodness, I wish I'd had
time to sew a proper pattern...

06:23.543 --> 06:24.809
Boo!

06:24.811 --> 06:26.310
You're a scary little ghost.

06:26.312 --> 06:27.545
MS. EVERS
...do things with your time,

06:27.547 --> 06:28.979
while I'm taking
in the laundry

06:28.981 --> 06:30.481
and mending clothes.

06:30.483 --> 06:31.716
But I'm so envious.

06:31.718 --> 06:33.317
You look so lovely.

06:33.319 --> 06:35.353
I do feel bad for little Albert.

06:35.355 --> 06:37.355
He wanted
an African cheetah costume,

06:37.357 --> 06:41.192
but I just never
found the time.

06:41.194 --> 06:44.895
Where is he,
the little rascal?

06:44.897 --> 06:47.431
(car engine starts up)

06:48.568 --> 06:50.601
No! Please stop!

06:55.141 --> 06:56.140
(knocking)

06:56.142 --> 06:57.575
Who is it?

06:57.577 --> 06:59.977
It's John Lowe from downstairs.

06:59.979 --> 07:00.911
Oh!

07:04.183 --> 07:06.050
I'm busy!

07:08.254 --> 07:10.321
I'm working on these sheets!

07:17.730 --> 07:19.230
What happened here?
Was there an accident?

07:19.232 --> 07:20.664
It happens every year.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.666
At this time.

07:22.668 --> 07:24.535
I-I lost my boy on Halloween.

07:24.537 --> 07:28.372
So every year I go a little mad
and I make a mess of everything.

07:28.374 --> 07:31.409
And I can't get a-a handle
on the sheet situation.

07:31.411 --> 07:33.444
You lost your boy?

07:33.446 --> 07:34.845
You mean he died?

07:34.847 --> 07:36.847
Not right away.

07:36.849 --> 07:38.015
How did you lose him?

07:38.017 --> 07:40.251
I didn't see!

07:40.253 --> 07:42.353
I wasn't paying attention!

07:44.023 --> 07:46.257
(crying):
It was my fault!

07:46.259 --> 07:48.225
I should've made him
a proper costume,

07:48.227 --> 07:50.361
like all the children.

07:50.363 --> 07:52.463
I know how that feels,

07:52.465 --> 07:55.366
especially
around the anniversary.

07:55.368 --> 07:58.269
I-I made him wear
a plain old sheet.

07:58.271 --> 08:00.404
Just a plain old sheet.

08:00.406 --> 08:04.442
Why didn't I pay
more attention?!

08:04.444 --> 08:05.576
I'm not really sure.

08:05.578 --> 08:07.044
I feel like I'm living

08:07.046 --> 08:09.547
in a walking nightmare.

08:14.420 --> 08:16.487
Would you like a sherry?

08:20.293 --> 08:21.559
I'm okay, thank you.

08:21.561 --> 08:23.828
I'll let you
get back...

08:23.830 --> 08:25.996
Will-will you pour me one?

08:28.267 --> 08:29.433
Talking with you

08:29.435 --> 08:32.002
is a comfort to my soul.

08:45.351 --> 08:49.286
They searched the
city for days.

08:49.288 --> 08:52.156
But he wasn't
in the city.

08:52.158 --> 08:55.593
<i> His killer...</i>
<i> took him to his ranch</i>

08:55.595 --> 08:57.461
<i> up in Wineville.</i>

08:57.463 --> 08:59.029
(chickens clucking)

09:04.604 --> 09:07.338
<i> Oh, God, help me!</i>

09:09.842 --> 09:12.476
<i> He haunts my dreams.</i>

09:12.478 --> 09:15.980
<i> His woeful eyes pierce me</i>
<i> with accusations.</i>

09:15.982 --> 09:19.416
Why weren't you careful Mommy?

09:21.721 --> 09:23.287
Didn't you love me, Mommy?

09:23.289 --> 09:26.190
(crying)

09:26.192 --> 09:29.260
Of course I loved him!

09:34.133 --> 09:36.400
At least you know
what happened to your boy.

09:39.705 --> 09:41.205
But I don't.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.606
Not really.

09:57.490 --> 10:01.158
This is all we found
of your boy, ma'am.

10:01.160 --> 10:03.027
That sicko disposed

10:03.029 --> 10:05.763
of all their bodies
in quicklime.

10:05.765 --> 10:07.565
And then he scattered
their bones in a mass grave.

10:07.567 --> 10:11.435
Oh...

10:11.437 --> 10:13.304
(screams)

10:16.409 --> 10:18.409
They never were sure exactly

10:18.411 --> 10:20.578
how many children there were.

10:20.580 --> 10:24.548
That is a terrible story, Ms...

10:24.550 --> 10:26.750
Evers.

10:26.752 --> 10:29.186
Hazel Evers.

10:29.188 --> 10:31.555
You can call me Hazel.

10:31.557 --> 10:33.023
I'm John.

10:33.025 --> 10:36.794
I know.

10:36.796 --> 10:39.597
I have a confession
to make, John.

10:39.599 --> 10:43.133
I've known for a while
that we were kindred spirits.

10:43.135 --> 10:45.769
(laughing)

10:45.771 --> 10:47.972
Oh, my!

10:47.974 --> 10:49.773
Oh, my, it's so late
and I'm so behind!

10:49.775 --> 10:52.042
There's so much to do
before the shindig tonight,

10:52.044 --> 10:53.143
and so little time!

10:53.145 --> 10:54.745
The master will be

10:54.747 --> 10:57.548
very very upset if his
table isn't perfect.

10:57.550 --> 11:00.217
His autumnal banquet
is the event of the year.

11:00.219 --> 11:03.087
These particular guests,
they're very demanding.

11:03.089 --> 11:05.756
Refills, refills, refills!

11:05.758 --> 11:07.625
My feet are swollen up
like puff pastries

11:07.627 --> 11:09.059
by the end of the night!

11:28.681 --> 11:30.714
(barking)

11:31.817 --> 11:35.019
Jasper, stop that.

11:35.021 --> 11:36.186
Come here, come here.

11:36.188 --> 11:37.588
Jasper, come on.

11:38.691 --> 11:40.124
In here.

11:40.126 --> 11:43.494
(Jasper growls)

11:43.496 --> 11:46.764
He's a sweet dog.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.265
He just doesn't
know who you are.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.833
We got him two years ago.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.702
Your sister was lonely.

11:56.108 --> 11:57.808
I'm gonna do an exam.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.743
It'll only take a minute, okay?

12:01.113 --> 12:03.280
It's too bright.

12:03.282 --> 12:04.615
Sorry.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.185
I'm sorry.
Come over here, baby.

12:12.658 --> 12:15.526
Can you sit
still for me?

12:18.130 --> 12:19.430
(thermometer beeps)

12:21.634 --> 12:24.568
Do you feel cold?

12:24.570 --> 12:26.136
No.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.505
No?

12:28.507 --> 12:30.774
Do you know where
you are, baby?

12:32.878 --> 12:35.312
Hmm? Do you remember
this house?

12:37.717 --> 12:39.917
You're home.

12:39.919 --> 12:42.953
You're finally home, baby.

12:44.356 --> 12:46.423
Oh, I've missed you
so much.

12:48.694 --> 12:51.795
I'm thirsty.

12:52.765 --> 12:54.832
Of course you are.

12:54.834 --> 12:56.900
I'll get you some juice,
all right?

12:58.571 --> 13:00.904
Be right back.

13:17.790 --> 13:18.956
(sobs quietly)

13:21.727 --> 13:23.994
(sobbing)

13:41.881 --> 13:43.013
(sniffs)

13:53.759 --> 13:55.759
Holden, I've brought you
an apple juice

13:55.761 --> 13:57.227
and an orange juice.

13:57.229 --> 13:58.862
Wasn't sure which one...

13:59.799 --> 14:01.198
Holden?

14:04.170 --> 14:07.070
Holden!
(Jasper whimpers)

14:07.072 --> 14:09.072
What is wrong
with you?

14:09.074 --> 14:10.908
I don't feel good.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.076
I need my mommy.

14:13.078 --> 14:14.912
Baby, I am your mommy.

14:14.914 --> 14:16.747
My other mommy.

14:22.421 --> 14:24.688
It's confirmed.

14:24.690 --> 14:27.191
Blood on your junkie
wasn't his.

14:27.193 --> 14:29.159
So we're looking for a body now.

14:29.161 --> 14:31.929
You don't think
we have enough bodies?

14:33.632 --> 14:35.199
Hey, how come
I've never heard of a town

14:35.201 --> 14:36.633
where 20 kiddie murders

14:36.635 --> 14:38.268
and abductions
supposedly took place?

14:38.270 --> 14:40.804
Are you talking about the
Wineville Chicken Coop Murders?

14:40.806 --> 14:42.639
They changed the name
of the town.

14:42.641 --> 14:44.708
Bad publicity.

14:44.710 --> 14:46.476
When?

14:46.478 --> 14:48.078
Hell, 60 years ago?

14:51.851 --> 14:53.784
Eighty-five.

14:55.988 --> 14:58.188
85... years...

14:58.190 --> 15:00.858
The crimes took place
in the '20s?

15:00.860 --> 15:03.527
Does this have something to do
with our Bible-thumper?

15:03.529 --> 15:04.628
I don't know.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.897
HAHN:
John?

15:06.899 --> 15:08.799
John, you okay?

15:37.730 --> 15:39.796
¶ ¶

16:07.893 --> 16:10.894
COUNTESS:
You must have
a lot of questions.

16:10.896 --> 16:14.164
I have answers.

16:25.377 --> 16:27.044
It must have been
a shock for you

16:27.046 --> 16:28.278
to see your boy.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.546
I imagined you'd
lost hope long ago.

16:29.548 --> 16:30.981
I never gave up.

16:30.983 --> 16:32.316
No, you didn't.

16:32.318 --> 16:33.784
Your devotion moved me.

16:33.786 --> 16:36.553
I could feel your longing.

16:37.823 --> 16:38.956
Holden felt it, too.

16:38.958 --> 16:40.357
That's why
he came to you.

16:41.994 --> 16:43.994
You stole my son.

16:43.996 --> 16:46.096
I saved him.

16:46.098 --> 16:47.731
Like I save all my children.

16:47.733 --> 16:50.701
From what?

16:52.905 --> 16:54.938
Neglect.

16:54.940 --> 16:56.506
I could see
where they were headed.

16:56.508 --> 16:58.241
A tragic, wasted life.

16:58.243 --> 16:59.776
I opened my heart

16:59.778 --> 17:00.944
and the children
came to me willingly.

17:00.946 --> 17:02.779
I never neglected my son.

17:02.781 --> 17:05.182
Can you say the same
about your husband?

17:06.151 --> 17:08.018
Here you go.

17:09.989 --> 17:12.055
(phone buzzing)

17:16.929 --> 17:18.595
Yeah.

17:18.597 --> 17:20.097
Yeah, I'll meet you
at the station later.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.007
JOHN:
Holden!

17:30.009 --> 17:33.110
(carnival music playing)

17:33.112 --> 17:34.845
Holden?!

17:36.982 --> 17:38.215
<i> Holden!</i>

17:42.021 --> 17:45.489
I brought them here
to keep them safe.

17:45.491 --> 17:48.025
The world can be
such a dangerous place.

17:48.027 --> 17:50.827
I've had enough
of your bullshit.

17:50.829 --> 17:53.063
What did you do to my son?

17:53.065 --> 17:54.464
You're a doctor.

17:54.466 --> 17:56.133
I'm going to put it to you

17:56.135 --> 17:58.902
in a way that
you can understand.

17:58.904 --> 18:01.171
Holden has contracted
an ancient virus.

18:01.173 --> 18:03.040
A blood disorder.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.308
The effect of the disease
is health,

18:05.310 --> 18:07.644
vitality and everlasting life.

18:12.084 --> 18:15.085
Whatever you did to him...

18:15.087 --> 18:17.320
...change him back.
Is this why you came up here?

18:17.322 --> 18:19.056
Change him back
or I'll kill you.

18:19.058 --> 18:21.091
There is no going back.

18:21.093 --> 18:22.726
No.

18:22.728 --> 18:25.262
I'm his mother.

18:25.264 --> 18:27.030
We'll find a cure.

18:27.032 --> 18:28.732
There is no cure.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.901
The only way you can truly be
with Holden is to join him.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.837
Alex, I'm offering you eternity

18:33.839 --> 18:35.605
with your great lost love.

18:35.607 --> 18:38.008
What I wouldn't trade
for a chance at that.

18:38.010 --> 18:41.945
And what are you asking me
to trade for it?

18:41.947 --> 18:44.014
What's the price I have to pay
to be like you?

18:44.016 --> 18:46.550
Your undying loyalty.

18:46.552 --> 18:48.151
You'll be working for me.

18:50.222 --> 18:52.189
Here.

18:53.892 --> 18:56.159
Take this. It will
calm your nerves.

18:58.197 --> 19:00.263
You're insane.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.765
You're going down.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.934
I'm getting the police.

19:03.936 --> 19:04.935
(screams)

19:06.738 --> 19:08.105
(whimpers)

19:08.107 --> 19:09.206
Let her go.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.583
She said she's gonna
go to the cops.

19:19.585 --> 19:21.318
She won't.

19:21.320 --> 19:25.055
She would never risk
losing her one true love.

19:25.057 --> 19:27.891
Wait, you're
banging her, too?

19:27.893 --> 19:29.960
¶ ¶

19:52.818 --> 19:55.252
What'll it be, soldier?

19:56.989 --> 19:59.789
Ginger ale?

19:59.791 --> 20:02.559
Shirley Temple?

20:12.638 --> 20:15.705
My soon to be ex-wife

20:15.707 --> 20:17.607
says I was never an alcoholic.

20:19.545 --> 20:23.013
According to her,
I'm just a control freak.

20:27.452 --> 20:30.086
I'll have a double martini.

20:33.959 --> 20:35.792
That's my boy.

20:35.794 --> 20:39.563
Control...
is an illusion.

20:39.565 --> 20:41.965
JOHN:
Tonight I surrender
to the illusion.

20:41.967 --> 20:43.300
(cocktail shaker rattles)

20:46.205 --> 20:48.405
(rock music playing)

20:59.551 --> 21:01.751
WOMAN:
Hey, sailor.

21:04.223 --> 21:05.355
Didn't see you come in.

21:05.357 --> 21:08.692
I will stand on my head
in a skirt

21:08.694 --> 21:10.260
for a ciggy and a beer.

21:10.262 --> 21:12.829
No need for
acrobatics.

21:12.831 --> 21:14.231
Drinks are
on me tonight.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.199
LIZ:
Now, Aileen,

21:16.201 --> 21:19.102
you be nice to Mr. Lowe.

21:19.705 --> 21:21.671
This is, what,

21:21.673 --> 21:24.107
your tenth year with us
at the hotel?

21:24.109 --> 21:26.409
Lucky 13th!
LIZ:
Ooh!

21:26.411 --> 21:28.345
Since 2002.

21:38.724 --> 21:40.624
Do I know you?

21:40.626 --> 21:43.059
I don't know.

21:43.061 --> 21:46.863
You ever picked up a hooker
along I-95 in Florida?

21:48.300 --> 21:50.900
No, I think I'd remember that.

21:50.902 --> 21:53.203
John...

21:53.205 --> 21:57.440
is a police officer...

21:57.442 --> 21:59.809
and a special guest

21:59.811 --> 22:02.345
of the hotel.

22:05.484 --> 22:07.617
Cop.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.753
A cop.

22:09.755 --> 22:11.254
(laughs)

22:11.256 --> 22:12.922
Man! Man.

22:12.924 --> 22:15.325
(bottle clunks on bar)

22:15.327 --> 22:17.460
Man, are you lucky
that I haven't had a beer

22:17.462 --> 22:20.330
in over a year,
or there is no way in hell

22:20.332 --> 22:21.931
I would let you
buy me one.

22:21.933 --> 22:23.333
They call me
a serial killer?

22:23.335 --> 22:27.370
Greatest serial killer
of all time is the cops.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.508
I know who you are.

22:31.510 --> 22:35.078
That is
an outstanding costume.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.480
Holy shit, you look
just like her.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.783
Her who?
Aileen Wuornos.

22:39.785 --> 22:41.117
Just saw a documentary
about her.

22:41.119 --> 22:42.652
She killed seven men.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.288
Shot them in cold blood.

22:45.290 --> 22:46.856
(cap pops off bottle)

22:48.260 --> 22:49.526
(sighs)

22:49.528 --> 22:51.428
Sometimes even I
think that's true.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.434
I wasn't more
than four or five

22:57.436 --> 22:59.369
when the world
started taking from me.

23:02.474 --> 23:04.307
You know what you do

23:04.309 --> 23:07.877
when all you know
is people taking?

23:07.879 --> 23:10.380
You start to give,
give it away

23:10.382 --> 23:11.715
before they can
take it from you.

23:11.717 --> 23:13.983
Give it all away for free,

23:13.985 --> 23:16.486
and that way,

23:16.488 --> 23:18.555
you can pretend
that it doesn't hurt.

23:21.893 --> 23:24.627
Those seven men?
We had a deal.

23:24.629 --> 23:26.196
We had a deal.

23:26.198 --> 23:28.331
Then they got greedy,
started taking things

23:28.333 --> 23:29.733
didn't belong to 'em.

23:29.735 --> 23:31.835
Here's how it is,
Detective:

23:31.837 --> 23:34.371
you try and take anything

23:34.373 --> 23:36.406
from Aileen Wuornos

23:36.408 --> 23:39.342
and I swear
to Jesus H. Christ

23:39.344 --> 23:41.811
I will take
everything from you.

23:43.815 --> 23:45.915
This is what
I say to you, Aileen:

23:49.020 --> 23:50.353
That's bullshit.

23:50.355 --> 23:51.354
Yeah?

23:51.356 --> 23:52.722
Yeah.

23:52.724 --> 23:55.225
Most of those men
didn't have a history

23:55.227 --> 23:57.260
or record of violence
or assault.

23:57.262 --> 23:58.495
I don't know,
I don't know their,

23:58.497 --> 23:59.562
I don't know their history.

23:59.564 --> 24:01.598
I only know

24:01.600 --> 24:04.234
who they were
on that day.

24:04.236 --> 24:05.602
I only knew them
on that one day,

24:05.604 --> 24:07.504
and on that one day,
they were who they were.

24:10.542 --> 24:13.109
Haven't you ever had
a day like that, huh?

24:15.213 --> 24:17.547
Yeah.

24:17.549 --> 24:21.084
Where-where all you were,
all you ever had been

24:21.086 --> 24:23.353
your whole life don't mean
nothing to you anymore?

24:23.355 --> 24:27.390
And all of a sudden...

24:27.392 --> 24:30.260
you're just
a different person, huh?

24:30.262 --> 24:31.561
Yeah.
Yeah?

24:31.563 --> 24:33.396
Today.

24:33.398 --> 24:35.398
When was the last time
you got laid, huh?

24:35.400 --> 24:38.435
When was the last time
a chick really...

24:38.437 --> 24:40.437
really turned you
inside out?

24:40.439 --> 24:43.706
You don't know screwing
until you spend an hour alone

24:43.708 --> 24:45.074
with a batshit crazy hooker.

24:45.076 --> 24:47.143
I got a room.

24:48.113 --> 24:50.180
Where I can roll.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.454
Darling John,

24:57.456 --> 25:00.790
you're too drunk to see
how ugly that woman is.

25:02.828 --> 25:04.828
I'm too drunk to care.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.896
(laughs)

25:10.569 --> 25:11.634
(chuckles)

25:14.105 --> 25:16.105
You asshole.

25:16.107 --> 25:18.441
Goddamn cops.

25:18.443 --> 25:20.610
You can't trust
any of them.

25:20.612 --> 25:21.945
Stop taking from me!

25:21.947 --> 25:23.112
I'm tied to a chair!

25:23.114 --> 25:24.948
Well, I ain't no liar.

25:24.950 --> 25:27.584
Ten women this shit
country put to death,

25:28.286 --> 25:29.486
Ten.

25:29.488 --> 25:31.855
And I was number ten.

25:31.857 --> 25:33.857
Stop it! You're insane!

25:33.859 --> 25:35.458
You're not Aileen Wuornos!

25:35.460 --> 25:36.693
Yeah?

25:38.096 --> 25:39.929
Look at me.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.300
Look at my eyes.

25:44.302 --> 25:46.669
Look at 'em.

25:47.939 --> 25:50.673
This look like a Halloween
costume to you?

25:50.675 --> 25:52.509
(snickers)

25:52.511 --> 25:56.112
Welcome to Devil's Night
at the Hotel Cortez, John.

26:20.572 --> 26:22.005
Ain't you...

26:22.007 --> 26:24.407
(groans)

26:24.409 --> 26:25.608
Yeah, you like that?

26:26.645 --> 26:28.411
(screams)

26:28.413 --> 26:30.780
Die, you pussy boy!

26:34.886 --> 26:36.886
Asshole!

26:36.888 --> 26:39.355
Get... get back here!

26:39.357 --> 26:41.658
Bite your damn dick off!

26:41.660 --> 26:42.792
Bring it on, baby!

26:44.229 --> 26:45.695
Let's see who you really are.

26:45.697 --> 26:47.096
(spits)

26:52.771 --> 26:55.271
(elevator dings)

27:06.451 --> 27:07.984
Can I help you?

27:10.622 --> 27:12.422
Excuse me.

27:12.424 --> 27:13.623
Is there a problem?
Yeah, there's a problem.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.758
That skank up in my room
tried to kill me.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.628
Skank? You'll have
to be more specific.

27:18.630 --> 27:20.196
You know,
that nut job

27:20.198 --> 27:21.864
up at the bar pretending
to be Aileen Wuornos.

27:21.866 --> 27:23.399
She's leaving here
in cuffs.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.802
Yeah, I wouldn't
bother with that call

27:25.804 --> 27:27.604
you're trying to make.

27:27.606 --> 27:29.606
Even if you got through,
dollars to doughnuts,

27:29.608 --> 27:31.407
you won't find
anyone in your room.

27:31.409 --> 27:34.644
Mr. March is very protective
of his invited guests.

27:34.646 --> 27:36.045
Mr. March?

27:36.047 --> 27:37.580
James Patrick March?

27:37.582 --> 27:39.582
The very same.

27:39.584 --> 27:42.251
His annual Devil's Night soiree
is<i> the</i> event of the season.

27:42.253 --> 27:43.886
What the hell
is Devil's Night?

27:45.890 --> 27:48.491
Oh, sweetie.

27:50.662 --> 27:53.229
Devil's Night is the real
holiday around here.

27:53.231 --> 27:55.999
Halloween, that's plastic
pumpkins and paper costumes,

27:56.001 --> 27:57.900
but Devil's Night...

27:57.902 --> 28:01.638
is when the real ghouls
come out to play.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.640
A night of mischievous
criminal behavior,

28:03.642 --> 28:05.441
which is why
every year at this time,

28:05.443 --> 28:08.511
Mr. March holds
his annual dinner event.

28:08.513 --> 28:10.713
The guest list
is<i> très exclusive.</i>

28:13.852 --> 28:15.852
(gasps)

28:15.854 --> 28:17.854
Well, that's unusual.

28:17.856 --> 28:19.922
Now, how did I miss this?

28:27.766 --> 28:29.832
Lucky you.

28:31.469 --> 28:33.736
You've been invited.

28:37.642 --> 28:40.710
¶ ¶

29:05.537 --> 29:07.603
¶ ¶

29:32.397 --> 29:34.263
(elevator bell dings)

29:34.265 --> 29:36.799
(Benny Goodman's "Moonglow"
playing in distance)

29:44.209 --> 29:46.809
¶ ¶

29:50.181 --> 29:51.681
(music grows louder)

29:51.683 --> 29:53.683
MAN: The key to a really
good subfloor

29:53.685 --> 29:57.186
is containing the moisture
below the floor.

29:57.188 --> 30:00.723
See, you need to make sure
that there's a-a... a layer.

30:00.725 --> 30:03.459
Like...

30:06.231 --> 30:08.030
Hey, John.

30:08.032 --> 30:09.766
Hey, listen,
I-I want to apologize

30:09.768 --> 30:12.869
for what happened, man.

30:12.871 --> 30:14.237
I wasn't mad at you,
it's just...

30:14.239 --> 30:15.805
it's just cops in general.

30:15.807 --> 30:18.508
Men in general,
right? (laughs)

30:21.579 --> 30:23.112
Hey, hey, come sit next to me.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.647
Between you and me,
you don't want to sit

30:24.649 --> 30:26.048
next to Jeff or John.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.151
They like 'em young and
cute, like you. (laughs)

30:28.153 --> 30:30.219
Just keep your
distance.
Aw...

30:30.221 --> 30:31.988
Enjoy your last night
of freedom.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.890
You're leaving here
in my custody.

30:33.892 --> 30:36.592
AILEEN:
Hey, come on.

30:36.594 --> 30:37.794
I'm sorry about
what happened, man.

30:37.796 --> 30:39.595
Just sit...
you sit here.
No, Aileen.

30:39.597 --> 30:41.397
John will sit where
his name card is.
(groans)

30:41.399 --> 30:43.166
You know we like to do
things formally around here.

30:43.168 --> 30:44.934
Hey, suck my left tit,
Clark Gable.

30:44.936 --> 30:47.436
Ah, we're all here now.

30:47.438 --> 30:50.606
Let's sit-- only so many
hours in the night.

30:50.608 --> 30:51.841
John, you're
by the other John.

30:51.843 --> 30:52.842
John, you're here.

30:52.844 --> 30:53.910
Ricky, here.

30:53.912 --> 30:55.578
Ah...

30:55.580 --> 30:56.813
Absinthe.

30:56.815 --> 30:58.848
Our customary libation.

30:58.850 --> 31:01.884
To our special night
and our new guest.

31:08.193 --> 31:09.826
(coughs, laughs)

31:11.863 --> 31:13.930
(Aileen whoops)

31:15.934 --> 31:17.200
What is this?

31:17.202 --> 31:18.701
Who are you?

31:18.703 --> 31:22.505
I'm March,
I built this hotel.

31:22.507 --> 31:26.342
The man who built this hotel
died more than 85 years ago.

31:28.112 --> 31:30.646
This is my problem
with police officers.

31:30.648 --> 31:32.648
All you care about
is evidence.

31:32.650 --> 31:34.650
Evidence, evidence,
evidence.

31:34.652 --> 31:36.485
Until that evidence
no longer fits

31:36.487 --> 31:38.287
the narrative
you need to be true,

31:38.289 --> 31:41.624
at which point the evidence
becomes an illusion, a mistake.

31:41.626 --> 31:43.025
A trick.

31:43.027 --> 31:46.529
You've lived in my hotel
long enough, John,

31:46.531 --> 31:49.532
seen enough evidence to know
that what is impossible

31:49.534 --> 31:51.901
becomes very possible here.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.205
You're late!

31:57.909 --> 31:59.976
RAMIREZ: Too busy
writing letters.

31:59.978 --> 32:01.244
(Aileen laughs)

32:01.246 --> 32:02.845
RAMIREZ: I don't
get you, man.

32:02.847 --> 32:04.146
The real fun starts
after you get caught.

32:04.148 --> 32:05.414
Don't you know that?

32:05.416 --> 32:07.016
And giving yourself
your own nickname?

32:07.018 --> 32:08.017
Not cool, dude.

32:08.019 --> 32:10.519
It's not cool.

32:10.521 --> 32:13.155
Now, let's all
introduce ourselves.

32:13.157 --> 32:14.690
I'm John too, John Gacy.

32:14.692 --> 32:16.692
I'm from Norwood Park, Illinois.

32:16.694 --> 32:18.494
I own PDM Contractors.

32:18.496 --> 32:20.897
Uh, PDM stands for Painting,
Decorating, Maintenance.

32:20.899 --> 32:23.032
And I'm also a member
of the Moose Club.

32:23.034 --> 32:24.700
I mean, just because you got

32:24.702 --> 32:26.702
30 bodies buried
in your crawl space

32:26.704 --> 32:28.704
don't mean you can't have
a really terrific rec room

32:28.706 --> 32:30.973
and be a respectable
business man.

32:35.947 --> 32:38.514
Uh, my turn?

32:38.516 --> 32:41.017
Okay.

32:41.019 --> 32:45.187
I'm, uh, Jeffrey Dahmer.

32:45.189 --> 32:46.722
From Milwaukee.

32:46.724 --> 32:49.525
AILEEN: Oh, John,
I think he likes you.

32:49.527 --> 32:51.294
(laughing): And that
is bad news for you.

32:51.296 --> 32:52.728
That's how
he picks 'em.

32:52.730 --> 32:53.963
He finds the hottest guy
in the room

32:53.965 --> 32:55.298
and the next thing...
(clicks tongue)

32:55.300 --> 32:57.566
(Aileen laughs)

32:57.568 --> 32:58.567
AILEEN:
No.

32:58.569 --> 33:01.137
All right.

33:01.139 --> 33:02.972
Zodiac, they never caught you

33:02.974 --> 33:04.774
but I assume you'd
be dead by now.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.876
Dickheads like you don't just
retire from being assholes.

33:06.878 --> 33:10.613
Gacy, you were killed by lethal
injection over 25 years ago.

33:10.615 --> 33:13.049
Dahmer, you were
murdered in prison.

33:13.051 --> 33:14.784
Deservedly.

33:14.786 --> 33:17.219
Aileen Wuornos, put to
death in 2002 in Florida.

33:17.221 --> 33:20.823
And I know you, 'cause
you're from my hometown.

33:20.825 --> 33:23.592
Richard Ramirez,
the Night Stalker.

33:23.594 --> 33:26.896
You just died of cancer in
your cell a few years back.

33:26.898 --> 33:28.764
What is this?

33:28.766 --> 33:30.833
Some kind of Halloween trick?

33:31.803 --> 33:33.069
What,
are you actors?

33:33.071 --> 33:34.337
I invited you here tonight

33:34.339 --> 33:36.339
to help you, John.

33:36.341 --> 33:40.343
I've watched you,
and it makes me sad.

33:40.345 --> 33:43.346
Because greatness
is about vision.

33:43.348 --> 33:45.848
And you have made yourself blind

33:45.850 --> 33:48.651
to everything but what
your eyes can see.

33:48.653 --> 33:50.653
You need to listen
to this dude, John.

33:50.655 --> 33:53.656
He... is the master.

33:53.658 --> 33:55.024
I mean,
he taught us all.

33:55.026 --> 33:58.027
He's a genius, like Galileo
or Peter Frampton.

33:58.029 --> 34:01.030
GACY: That's why we come
here every Devil's Night.

34:01.032 --> 34:03.165
It's, uh, like
a tradition.

34:03.167 --> 34:04.934
It's a real honor to be invited.

34:04.936 --> 34:07.937
Only the ones of us who really
took the master's advice

34:07.939 --> 34:09.605
gets an invite.

34:09.607 --> 34:11.374
Do you know why
it took so long

34:11.376 --> 34:13.042
for the little piggies
to catch me?

34:13.044 --> 34:15.044
Because one night
I stumbled into this place,

34:15.046 --> 34:16.345
and I spent
a few nights,

34:16.347 --> 34:18.114
and the master,
he came into my room,

34:18.116 --> 34:21.884
and he beat the crap
out of me, eh?

34:21.886 --> 34:25.388
And he told me that if I wanted
to be a volume operation

34:25.390 --> 34:27.857
that I needed to be
indiscriminate-- kill anyone.

34:27.859 --> 34:30.860
Your pattern needs
to be no pattern.

34:30.862 --> 34:31.961
Guess I was out sick
that day. (laughs)

34:31.963 --> 34:34.997
It's not funny, Gacy!

34:34.999 --> 34:37.500
We are the Mount Rushmore
of murder.

34:37.502 --> 34:39.802
We have reputations,
codes of conduct.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.037
I've told you how many times?

34:41.039 --> 34:42.705
Leave no evidence.

34:42.707 --> 34:44.507
GACY: I covered
'em all with lye.

34:44.509 --> 34:46.509
It's not my fault that
the cop who used my bathroom

34:46.511 --> 34:49.145
was very familiar with the
smell of rotting bodies.

34:49.147 --> 34:53.182
I told them-- it was
my Lhasa apso who piddled

34:53.184 --> 34:55.818
on the kitchen floor,
but they didn't believe me.

34:55.820 --> 34:58.054
Murder is one part
perspiration,

34:58.056 --> 34:59.855
ten parts preparation.
Mmm.

34:59.857 --> 35:01.657
I built this hotel
for the sole purpose

35:01.659 --> 35:04.326
of hiding the evidence.

35:04.328 --> 35:06.929
All of my chutes and ladders,
have you seen them yet, John?

35:06.931 --> 35:09.098
Miracles of modern
engineering.

35:09.100 --> 35:12.668
Mr. Gacy here came
to the Hotel Cortez

35:12.670 --> 35:14.670
when he was just a young man.

35:14.672 --> 35:16.705
18 or 19.

35:16.707 --> 35:19.008
I was living in Vegas,
and I wanted to see the Pacific,

35:19.010 --> 35:21.444
so I got in the old Buick
and drove out for the weekend

35:21.446 --> 35:24.180
and stayed here--
six bucks a night.

35:24.182 --> 35:27.950
I showed him my secrets,
he was good, very good.

35:27.952 --> 35:29.952
But imagine what he could
have accomplished

35:29.954 --> 35:32.254
had he really listened to me.

35:32.256 --> 35:34.890
33 bodies.

35:34.892 --> 35:36.759
He could have had 333.

35:41.199 --> 35:42.765
GACY: Huh?
That's my trick.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.819
The handcuffs.

35:46.820 --> 35:48.370
Once I have them cuffed,
it's pretty much all over.

35:48.372 --> 35:50.439
MARCH:
No need to worry, John.

35:50.441 --> 35:53.309
It's the absinthe,
dear boy.

35:56.147 --> 35:58.147
When I was 19,

35:58.149 --> 36:01.117
trucker picked me up
hitchhiking.

36:01.119 --> 36:02.785
And that was before I knew
how to take care of myself.

36:02.787 --> 36:06.589
That dick cheese drove
me all the way to L.A.

36:06.591 --> 36:09.158
Bought me In-N-Out.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.160
Tossed me to the curb.

36:11.162 --> 36:12.995
It wasn't until I stumbled
into this place...

36:12.997 --> 36:15.397
and met the master that I knew,

36:15.399 --> 36:17.333
I knew I was
really worth something.

36:17.335 --> 36:20.903
It's the first man that ever
treated me with respect.

36:20.905 --> 36:24.006
Jeffrey?

36:24.008 --> 36:25.808
You're even more quiet
than usual tonight.

36:27.078 --> 36:29.812
I'm just hungry.

36:29.814 --> 36:32.014
Ah, Ms. Evers.

36:32.016 --> 36:33.415
It's always a delight.

36:33.417 --> 36:35.184
Ladies first.

36:35.186 --> 36:37.386
Please.

36:43.127 --> 36:46.629
I don't eat salad.

36:46.631 --> 36:49.131
AILEEN:
Jeffrey likes dark meat!

36:49.133 --> 36:51.200
(laughter)

37:10.188 --> 37:12.521
Miss Evers, bring out

37:12.523 --> 37:15.357
the amuse-bouche now,
would you?

37:15.359 --> 37:16.859
¶ ¶

37:16.861 --> 37:18.394
Ah.

37:18.396 --> 37:20.829
¶ Wouldn't turn around
and break it ¶

37:20.831 --> 37:23.732
Thank you, John.

37:23.734 --> 37:28.204
¶ And anyone who's
ever played a part ¶

37:28.206 --> 37:32.741
¶ Wouldn't turn around
and hate it ¶

37:35.680 --> 37:37.213
¶ Sweet Jane ¶

37:37.215 --> 37:39.315
MARCH:
See, Jeffrey?

37:39.317 --> 37:41.984
Don't I always take
care of you?

37:41.986 --> 37:44.153
¶ Sweet Jane ¶
Don't I?

37:44.155 --> 37:47.256
Oh, I'll help
you there, boy.

37:47.258 --> 37:51.860
¶ Oh, sweet, sweet Jane ¶

37:51.862 --> 37:54.597
Please don't ever leave me.

37:54.599 --> 37:56.899
I'll get my drill.

37:56.901 --> 38:00.269
No!

38:00.271 --> 38:02.271
No, no...

38:02.273 --> 38:04.773
¶ Waiting down

38:04.775 --> 38:09.445
¶ On the corner ¶

38:09.447 --> 38:13.215
See, I want to control them.

38:13.217 --> 38:15.517
I want to make them

38:15.519 --> 38:16.685
mine.

38:16.687 --> 38:19.955
Make them part of me.

38:24.195 --> 38:27.229
I want to make them

38:27.231 --> 38:31.267
a part of me.

38:31.269 --> 38:33.902
Never freaking works though.

38:33.904 --> 38:36.438
They always die,
like, ten minutes later.

38:39.143 --> 38:41.543
MARCH: Oh, poor,
sweet Jeffrey.

38:41.545 --> 38:44.380
When we met he was on a detour
on his way back to Ohio

38:44.382 --> 38:46.382
from Miami where
he ended up

38:46.384 --> 38:48.284
after being kicked
out of the Army.

38:48.286 --> 38:51.387
I told him if you want
to be a great killer,

38:51.389 --> 38:53.055
you must understand people.

38:53.057 --> 38:55.090
To hunt them,

38:55.092 --> 38:56.792
you must be able to
get into their minds.

38:58.262 --> 39:02.064
I didn't think he would
take it literally.

39:02.066 --> 39:03.165
I listened to you
about burning the flesh

39:03.167 --> 39:04.500
off the bones with acid.

39:04.502 --> 39:07.336
Yes you did, dear, yes you did.

39:07.338 --> 39:11.307
¶ Oh, sweet Jane ¶

39:11.309 --> 39:12.341
I said stop!

39:12.343 --> 39:15.978
(whoops)
Nice shot, copper.

39:17.348 --> 39:19.348
Don't you get that
we're already dead?

39:19.350 --> 39:22.418
¶ La, la, la, la, la-la-la ¶

39:24.121 --> 39:28.257
¶ La, la, la, la-la-la ¶

39:29.360 --> 39:32.928
¶ Sweet Jane... ¶

39:50.715 --> 39:53.282
(indistinct chatter)

39:57.288 --> 40:00.356
(indistinct chatter,
laughter)

40:06.330 --> 40:10.265
You think they'll grow up to
be porn stars or strippers?

40:11.702 --> 40:13.235
My money's on stripping.

40:13.237 --> 40:14.570
It's free drinks.

40:16.006 --> 40:18.374
Those girls?

40:18.376 --> 40:20.042
They'll end up choking
on their own vomit

40:20.044 --> 40:22.644
before they hit 25.

40:26.484 --> 40:27.549
Halloween.

40:27.551 --> 40:29.985
It's for losers.

40:29.987 --> 40:32.755
Grown adults acting
like fools.

40:32.757 --> 40:35.357
Playing pretend.

40:35.359 --> 40:36.992
I like my life.

40:36.994 --> 40:39.928
I got a job that flies me
business class to L.A.

40:39.930 --> 40:42.398
Puts me up at the Bonaventure.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.466
(laughing)

40:47.238 --> 40:50.873
I don't need a Batman
costume to have some fun.

40:50.875 --> 40:53.442
And what's your idea of fun?

40:54.445 --> 40:57.479
Whatever you're selling.

41:11.529 --> 41:13.429
You should both be dead.

41:13.431 --> 41:16.965
Oh, no, he's not dead.

41:16.967 --> 41:18.066
He's the undead.

41:18.068 --> 41:19.401
I made him a zombie

41:19.403 --> 41:21.236
when I poured acid
in his brain.

41:21.238 --> 41:23.906
You're not gonna run
away from me anymore.

41:23.908 --> 41:25.908
I'm yours forever,
Jeffrey.

41:25.910 --> 41:27.709
(grunting)

41:27.711 --> 41:30.212
This, this isn't happening!

41:30.214 --> 41:32.648
I'm afraid we've
lost our detective.

41:32.650 --> 41:35.284
I thought he would appreciate
this dark evil,

41:35.286 --> 41:36.452
given the line of
work he's in.

41:36.454 --> 41:37.886
But John is clearly

41:37.888 --> 41:39.655
not yet our kind.

41:39.657 --> 41:41.256
Forget him.
I want to drink.

41:41.258 --> 41:42.424
To the master!

41:42.426 --> 41:44.693
Ah, thank you.

41:51.435 --> 41:55.471
Thank you all for being here
on Devil's Night,

41:55.473 --> 41:58.440
but it is I who should be
the one celebrating you.

41:58.442 --> 42:00.642
I look around

42:00.644 --> 42:02.811
and I see the definition

42:02.813 --> 42:05.614
of American success.

42:05.616 --> 42:07.683
They write books about you.

42:07.685 --> 42:09.551
Make movies
of your life.

42:10.521 --> 42:13.121
Johnny Depp likes my paintings!

42:13.123 --> 42:14.623
Years after your death,

42:14.625 --> 42:16.124
people continue

42:16.126 --> 42:18.427
to be enthralled.

42:18.429 --> 42:21.363
You've made your
mark in history.

42:21.365 --> 42:22.931
Like the<i> Iliad,</i>

42:22.933 --> 42:25.334
your stories will live on

42:25.336 --> 42:27.102
forever.

42:30.541 --> 42:33.542
I consider you all my equals.

42:33.544 --> 42:36.111
Nothing would please me more

42:36.113 --> 42:38.480
if you could stay and join me

42:38.482 --> 42:41.149
for dessert.

42:41.151 --> 42:42.951
(all cheering, clamoring)

42:44.989 --> 42:47.956
Dessert, almost forgot.

42:49.527 --> 42:52.461
I'm gonna go put
on my makeup.

42:52.463 --> 42:54.530
MARSH:
Ah.

42:54.532 --> 42:57.633
He's flying on an eight ball

42:57.635 --> 42:59.535
of China White.

42:59.537 --> 43:02.404
This will buy me a year
of being left alone, right?

43:02.406 --> 43:04.139
As always.

43:34.538 --> 43:36.805
¶ ¶

43:52.590 --> 43:55.023
To us,

43:55.025 --> 43:57.926
the greatest killers
of our time.

43:57.928 --> 44:00.662
This sacrifice
bonds us together.

44:02.232 --> 44:04.766
For eternity.

44:07.805 --> 44:11.740
(humming a tune)

44:11.742 --> 44:13.575
Pardon.

44:13.577 --> 44:14.977
(yells)

44:14.979 --> 44:16.044
(killers clamoring)

44:16.046 --> 44:19.381
No! No!

44:19.383 --> 44:22.651
No!

44:22.653 --> 44:24.086
John?
No! No!

44:24.088 --> 44:26.421
John! John! John! John!

44:26.423 --> 44:28.624
John, what are you doing?

44:28.626 --> 44:29.625
What are you doing?

44:29.627 --> 44:31.560
I need to help him!
Help who?

44:31.562 --> 44:33.629
The man you brought in
for them to kill!

44:33.631 --> 44:35.497
(shushing)

44:35.499 --> 44:37.265
There's nobody here, John.

44:37.267 --> 44:39.635
I don't understand.

44:39.637 --> 44:41.637
I came in the room
and you were alone.

44:41.639 --> 44:43.105
Crying.

44:43.107 --> 44:44.840
Have you been drinking?

44:44.842 --> 44:47.409
A little... at the bar.

44:47.411 --> 44:49.511
And they gave me absinthe.

44:49.513 --> 44:52.280
Oh, well,
that explains everything.

44:52.282 --> 44:56.618
You chased alcohol
with worm wood, John.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.720
You're hallucinating.

45:10.100 --> 45:12.134
Is anything real?

45:12.136 --> 45:13.602
(killers clamoring)

45:13.604 --> 45:14.870
I am.

45:14.872 --> 45:17.773
You have to trust me.

45:17.775 --> 45:20.809
I'm your protector.

45:20.811 --> 45:23.011
You disappeared on me last time.

45:23.013 --> 45:25.280
Oh.

45:25.282 --> 45:29.117
I'm not going anywhere.

45:29.119 --> 45:30.886
Come on.

45:30.888 --> 45:33.021
Let's get you
back to your room.

46:09.326 --> 46:11.960
¶ ¶

46:16.533 --> 46:19.167
COUNTESS:
<i> The transition</i>
<i> will not be easy.</i>

46:19.169 --> 46:23.772
<i> Birth is a painful process.</i>

46:23.774 --> 46:26.575
<i> As a mother, you know this.</i>

46:26.577 --> 46:30.011
Please.

46:30.013 --> 46:33.648
I can't lose my boy again.

46:35.753 --> 46:38.653
You must surrender
completely.

46:57.641 --> 47:01.243
And allow yourself
to be ripped apart.

47:01.245 --> 47:04.112
<i> Ravaged.</i>

47:04.114 --> 47:05.881
<i> You will feel</i>
<i> like you are dying.</i>

47:05.883 --> 47:08.216
<i> And maybe you are.</i>

47:08.218 --> 47:10.919
<i> But from blood comes life.</i>

47:10.921 --> 47:12.220
<i> Better.</i>

47:12.222 --> 47:15.157
<i> Stronger.</i>

47:15.159 --> 47:18.527
<i> More glorious than you</i>
<i> could've ever imagined.</i>

47:20.230 --> 47:24.065
<i> And you will rise.</i>

47:24.067 --> 47:27.169
And be reunited
with your child.

47:27.171 --> 47:29.738
For all of eternity.

47:34.077 --> 47:36.678
(gasps)
