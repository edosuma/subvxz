00:04.505 --> 00:10.876
Mr. Sanders, you illegally acquired
and then sold military-issue weapons,

00:11.045 --> 00:14.481
some of which have been used
in two homicide cases.

00:14.648 --> 00:18.482
Due to the overwhelming evidence
based on key witness testimony,

00:18.652 --> 00:23.021
the court finds you guilty
on all charges of arms trafficking.

00:23.324 --> 00:26.418
A sentence of 20 years
in a federal prison,

00:26.594 --> 00:28.152
with no chance of parole.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.630
You happy now?

00:31.799 --> 00:34.427
I was your key witness.
I wanted to make sure he didn't walk.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.467
Well, Nelson Sanders is done.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.260
You're safe, Ray.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.633
Joint Task Force: 1.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.173
Biggest arms dealer in the world: 0.

00:42.343 --> 00:43.833
Putting Sanders away is one thing.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.638
Recovering the rest of those weapons
is another.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.941
Two men are looking each other
in the eye.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.141
But only one of us is still alive.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.621
You understand that, Ray?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.278
Don't you?

01:02.329 --> 01:03.921
Last time I saw you this nervous

01:04.098 --> 01:06.430
was when those cops pinched us
in that stolen Camaro.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.192
It wasn't the cops
I was worried about.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.701
It was my dad showing up
at the precinct with a belt.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.862
My dad would have loved
to join that party,

01:13.073 --> 01:16.099
but apparently,
jail had him pretty occupied.

01:20.114 --> 01:23.174
- Are you ready?
- As I'll ever be.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.852
See you.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.223
Hey, get down.
Take cover! Take cover!

01:37.398 --> 01:39.025
Gunfire. Gunfire.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.371
- Eric, the motorcycle?
- Accessing traffic cameras now.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.721
Gentlemen, smile for the camera.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.015
Nice job, guys. That was insane.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.280
Just going with the flow.

02:35.456 --> 02:38.550
Does going with the flow
include screaming "yee-haw"?

02:38.726 --> 02:39.784
I was in character.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.222
You were in character.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.192
As who, Smokey or the Bandit?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.594
You gonna try that on the next op,
when I'm driving?

02:45.766 --> 02:47.734
No, I drive. You shoot.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.461
No, no, no. We agreed to take turns.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.572
I don't remember
having that conversation.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.403
- We could make a compromise.
- You'll ride on the back next time?

02:56.577 --> 02:58.044
Never gonna happen.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.976
Maybe we can get Hetty
to get you a sidecar.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.272
That's cute.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.576
You ever rode on a sidecar?
They're fun.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.945
Welcome
to Los Angeles International Airport.

03:10.124 --> 03:11.250
This is a non-smoking...

03:11.425 --> 03:14.258
Oh, I feel like I'm having
an allergic reaction to those squibs.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.827
You know, I have allergies, Marty.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.464
Well, maybe we should've set up
your relocation in Nebraska.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.066
Oh, that's not funny.
I'm the best informant you ever had.

03:21.235 --> 03:24.671
Ha, ha. A claim you can only make
due to the fact that you're a criminal.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.806
Retired.
You're looking at the new man.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.908
- Upstanding citizen.
- Ha, ha.

03:29.076 --> 03:30.236
Must've been difficult to say

03:30.411 --> 03:32.276
- with a straight face.
- Ha, ha.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.437
You gonna be able to handle
those women in Miami?

03:34.615 --> 03:35.673
The women, yes.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.147
But I feel like I'm gonna get whacked
by an alligator,

03:38.318 --> 03:40.809
like they're just waiting
for my pasty ass.

03:40.988 --> 03:43.513
You guys do know that alligators
don't prey on human beings,

03:43.724 --> 03:44.748
crocodiles do.

03:44.925 --> 03:48.122
Both live in the Miami vicinity,
but mainly in swamps.

03:49.530 --> 03:52.158
She just go all Wikipedia on me?

03:52.332 --> 03:54.197
Yeah, she just went all Wikipedia
on you.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.469
Due to increased
TSA security measures...

03:59.640 --> 04:02.040
- She looks just like, you know...
- I know, scary, right?

04:02.242 --> 04:04.369
- Who do I look like?
- It's not important.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.042
Marty and I grew up
in the same neighborhood,

04:07.247 --> 04:08.287
and there was this girl...

04:08.449 --> 04:09.541
Ray and I lost touch.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.480
Five years ago, I go undercover
to infiltrate an arms ring,

04:12.653 --> 04:15.121
and guess who I find
flopping around in the middle of it.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.279
I thought I was joining
a barbershop quartet.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.392
I gave him a choice.
I said, "You can go to jail

04:19.560 --> 04:21.050
or you can come work
as an informant."

04:21.261 --> 04:22.285
Yeah, some choice.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.294
Well, most guys don't get to choose.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.563
- Anything you want me to tell Nicole?
- Nope.

04:28.769 --> 04:29.793
She's your wife.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.666
Ex-wife.
Johnny Bravo's a solo act now.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.001
About that. Bravo was taken,

04:35.175 --> 04:38.235
so we got you dialed in
with one Charlie Mitchell.

04:38.412 --> 04:39.970
- What?
- Get to know it.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.209
Well, I guess this is it.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.010
Don't wanna keep
the alligators waiting.

04:45.486 --> 04:47.545
- Ray...
- All right.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.279
- Take care, brother.
- You too.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.689
Bye, Wikipedia.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.058
Take care of him.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.492
I will.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.664
He's a sucker for brunettes.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.939
What did he say? I don't really care.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.510
Never shoot back.

05:12.913 --> 05:13.937
Always shoot first.

05:23.891 --> 05:24.915
He seems cool.

05:27.461 --> 05:29.622
One of the coolest.

05:30.397 --> 05:34.424
- You know, for a bad guy.
- Uh-huh.

05:39.907 --> 05:43.468
This case is not over with yet,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.578
Ray gave us Nelson Sanders.

05:46.213 --> 05:50.980
But we still need to recover the
stolen military weapons which he sold.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.312
Which I'm sure
I don't need to remind you

05:53.487 --> 05:58.424
includes five AT4 rocket launchers,
all stolen from Camp Pendleton.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.886
Deeks.
How long you known this guy Ray?

06:08.402 --> 06:09.460
Just came over the wire.

06:09.636 --> 06:12.969
Police report a car rented
to Charlie Mitchell, Ray's new alias,

06:13.140 --> 06:16.109
was involved in a chase and
a shooting. Car was found abandoned.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.766
Wait. It hasn't even been two hours.

06:17.945 --> 06:20.311
Ray couldn't have got to Miami,
let alone rented a car.

06:20.480 --> 06:21.640
Oh, he's not in Miami.

06:22.498 --> 06:24.489
His car was found
in downtown Los Angeles.

06:37.530 --> 06:40.624
Airline says Ray never boarded
the flight. He cashed in his ticket.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.199
And rented a car instead.

06:42.501 --> 06:45.561
Why would he do that? I mean,
Nelson Sanders thinks he's dead.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.536
Ray's car was found two blocks
from the shooting.

06:50.609 --> 06:51.803
Looks like a botched hit.

06:51.977 --> 06:54.639
And if they hadn't crashed,
the bad guys would've killed him.

06:54.814 --> 06:57.806
No, we staged his murder.
We put it on television.

06:57.983 --> 07:00.747
There's no way the shooter
should have known he was still alive.

07:00.920 --> 07:01.978
Unless there's a leak.

07:02.154 --> 07:04.679
L.A.P.D. Reports no blood
at the scene.

07:04.857 --> 07:05.881
He got lucky.

07:06.058 --> 07:08.253
Can you zoom in on those shooters?

07:10.229 --> 07:11.560
It's too blurry to make an ID.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.398
Ray was a gunsmith. He worked with
every criminal group in Los Angeles.

07:15.568 --> 07:18.503
They find out that he was
an informant and that he's still in town,

07:18.671 --> 07:20.332
there's gonna be a huge price
on his head.

07:20.506 --> 07:23.441
- That is some serious firepower.
- M4 assault rifles.

07:23.642 --> 07:26.372
M4s were part of the shipment
stolen from Camp Pendleton.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.543
Ray's gotta be scared.
He's looking for me.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.783
- Then why hasn't he called you?
- And where is he headed?

07:32.418 --> 07:34.215
I don't know.

07:34.687 --> 07:37.679
But I know where he's gonna end up
sooner or later.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.750
I gotta go back undercover.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.790
- I'll shadow him.
- Go.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.032
Let's check out the crime scene.

08:06.318 --> 08:09.719
So this is the infamous Max Gentry.

08:09.889 --> 08:13.052
This is an alias I did not miss.

08:16.495 --> 08:20.261
As I recall, his reputation
was less than stellar.

08:20.432 --> 08:22.491
I've known Ray
since I was 10 years old.

08:22.701 --> 08:25.693
And I used our friendship to keep him
in the line of fire as an informant.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.333
Only reason he risked himself
because he trusted me.

08:28.507 --> 08:31.772
And yet he didn't tell you
about his change in travel plans.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.138
Doesn't matter.

08:33.312 --> 08:34.802
Somebody's gotta look out for him.

08:34.980 --> 08:36.413
Wow.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.717
Your loyalty is admirable.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.952
When I was 11 years old, my dad

08:46.125 --> 08:47.922
was one drink away
from killing Mom and me...

08:48.093 --> 08:50.755
Until you shot him in self-defense.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.960
.38 revolver that I used,

08:59.138 --> 09:00.833
Ray's the one that gave it to me.

09:03.008 --> 09:04.805
You know,

09:04.977 --> 09:08.777
- some might say you paid that debt.
- Yeah.

09:08.948 --> 09:12.042
Rather than send him to jail,
you took him under your wing.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.851
Let's be honest, I turned my best friend
into a snitch

09:17.022 --> 09:18.353
for a hundred dollars a week.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.858
If he gets himself killed,
that's on me.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.495
We get anything else,
we'll let you know.

09:31.670 --> 09:33.160
Appreciate it.

09:35.874 --> 09:38.638
The officer says that the driver
and the shooter abandoned the car

09:38.811 --> 09:41.041
and disappeared on foot.

09:43.482 --> 09:46.315
- Go ahead, Callen.
- Tell me you got something.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.747
Nothing on traffic cams.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.046
Could be military-issue.

09:49.221 --> 09:51.712
The shooters were described
as Hispanic and tattooed.

09:51.890 --> 09:54.085
It's L.A.
Doesn't exactly narrow it down.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.090
Eric, keep me posted.

09:56.528 --> 10:00.191
Sounds to me like Deeks' buddy's
been keeping some secrets.

10:09.341 --> 10:11.206
So, what's Max Gentry like?

10:12.578 --> 10:14.011
He's just a guy.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.080
Okay. Does he have an accent?

10:16.248 --> 10:19.183
Is he shy, life of the party, a wine guy?
A beer guy?

10:19.351 --> 10:21.444
You know what I mean?
How'd you come up with him?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.747
It's just an alias I threw together.
No big deal.

10:24.256 --> 10:25.917
Okay.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.422
I should go in first. I'll wait at the bar.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.427
No, I think it's better if I go in alone.

10:48.947 --> 10:50.107
Max.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.111
- Hey.
- Joey.

10:54.753 --> 10:55.913
Never gave me that money.

10:56.755 --> 10:59.280
Yeah. I was gonna,
but you disappeared.

10:59.458 --> 11:00.982
I can get it, Max, I swear. I just...

11:03.862 --> 11:05.591
Look at you.

11:05.764 --> 11:07.493
Come on, man, you're shaking.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.658
You're sweating.
You got cramps too?

11:10.869 --> 11:12.928
- Is it that time of the month?
- No.

11:16.975 --> 11:17.999
Wow.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.073
I think, uh, maybe I'll just collect it
from your girlfriend.

11:22.247 --> 11:23.305
No. Come on, man. Please.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.177
She doesn't have anything
to do with this.

11:25.384 --> 11:27.181
I've been meaning to call you, Max.
I have.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.820
No, I think she wants
to work off the vig.

11:29.988 --> 11:31.979
You want me to break the news
to her? I'll do it.

11:32.157 --> 11:34.125
I get it. I'll bring it to you tonight,
I swear.

11:34.293 --> 11:37.319
- I just... I gotta call some...
- Shut up. Shut up!

11:40.499 --> 11:42.865
- Did you hear about Ray?
- Yeah.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.969
It's been all over the news.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.764
I know you guys are tight.

11:46.939 --> 11:48.201
Sorry, man.

11:48.407 --> 11:49.840
Look at me.

11:50.008 --> 11:53.136
Anybody comes in here asking
about him, you let me know.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.643
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Understand?

11:54.813 --> 11:56.781
- Say you understand.
- I understand, man.

12:13.565 --> 12:15.556
It's been a long time.

12:16.435 --> 12:18.027
Look, uh, about Ray, l...

12:18.203 --> 12:20.569
You got my lunch ready?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.739
When was the last time
you saw him?

12:31.950 --> 12:34.510
Uh, maybe last week.

12:34.686 --> 12:35.983
He say anything I should know?

12:36.155 --> 12:37.554
No.

12:37.723 --> 12:38.985
Not really.

12:43.762 --> 12:46.026
He was acting like a buffoon,
as usual.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.098
Ran out on his tab.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.666
I'm sorry, Max. I...

12:49.835 --> 12:52.099
I just didn't wanna dump
all over your dead best friend.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.829
Yeah.

12:55.607 --> 12:57.199
Deeks, I got a visual on Ray.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.970
Don't break cover. I'll grab him.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.345
Ray.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.991
- What the hell was that?
- It's gunshots.

13:29.107 --> 13:30.438
Ray?

13:31.443 --> 13:35.004
- Hey. Where is he?
- He was right here.

13:47.532 --> 13:50.000
We ID'd the shooter Kensi took down
outside the pool hall.

13:50.161 --> 13:51.321
His name is Vince Mendoza.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.656
He was a foot soldier
for the Southland Kings.

13:53.831 --> 13:55.958
So, what do they stand to gain
from Ray's death?

13:56.133 --> 13:57.862
- Goes back to business.
- No.

13:58.035 --> 13:59.696
Ray never dealt
with the Southland Kings.

13:59.870 --> 14:01.670
They killed a buddy of ours
and he hated them.

14:01.839 --> 14:02.863
Are you sure?

14:03.040 --> 14:04.840
If something happened,
he would've come to me.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.500
But these guys don't try to murder
people for no reason, Deeks.

14:07.678 --> 14:09.646
And he didn't tell you
he wasn't going to Miami.

14:09.814 --> 14:12.044
Your best friend
is a career criminal, Deeks.

14:12.249 --> 14:14.547
He ditched his flight.
Then he rented a car

14:14.752 --> 14:17.346
that got shot up with rifles
after you took your eyes off him.

14:17.788 --> 14:19.312
Why would Ray make himself
a target?

14:19.490 --> 14:20.855
I don't know.

14:21.759 --> 14:24.489
There may be things
that Ray hasn't told you.

14:24.862 --> 14:27.888
You might not know your friend
as well as you think you do.

14:30.134 --> 14:34.537
The serial numbers on the M4 that
Vince Mendoza used were filed off.

14:34.705 --> 14:36.866
We've got a lab using
an electron microscope.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.908
They were able to pull a partial image,
but we're working on it.

14:40.077 --> 14:42.045
There's gotta be a reason
why Ray chose to stay:

14:42.213 --> 14:45.148
Money stashed somewhere,
an enemy he wanted to drop in on.

14:45.316 --> 14:46.510
That's not his style.

14:46.684 --> 14:48.743
- What about his wife?
- What? Nicole?

14:48.919 --> 14:51.649
He didn't even wanna take her
into relocation with him.

14:51.822 --> 14:53.187
He said their marriage was over.

14:53.357 --> 14:55.291
Sam,
that's because it's complicated.

14:56.427 --> 14:58.520
- Let's pick her up.
- Nicole doesn't know I'm a cop

14:58.696 --> 15:00.994
and she's gonna tell us a lot more
if it stays that way.

15:01.432 --> 15:05.027
All right, we'll have her picked up
and take her to the boatshed?

15:08.806 --> 15:10.535
Anything else
on the Southland Kings angle?

15:10.708 --> 15:13.871
Well, Mendoza is part owner of
a restaurant downtown, but it's a front.

15:14.044 --> 15:17.707
The Southland Kings are operating
what's known as a clandestino inside.

15:17.882 --> 15:20.350
A clandestino
is a Salvadorean speakeasy

15:20.518 --> 15:21.917
which caters to rich businessmen

15:22.086 --> 15:24.554
who want to gamble
in the presence of beautiful women.

15:24.722 --> 15:28.055
Let me guess,
Deeks is gonna take this one.

15:29.226 --> 15:31.558
No. I gotta talk to Nicole.

15:31.929 --> 15:35.228
Okay, I guess I'll send you guys
the address.

15:41.071 --> 15:42.095
This can't be it.

15:42.273 --> 15:44.036
That's the right address.

16:06.096 --> 16:07.495
Can I help you?

16:07.665 --> 16:10.395
- I'm Mr. Carl.
- I don't know you.

16:10.568 --> 16:12.900
You're obviously new
and that's okay.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.436
I run a little hedge fund downtown.

16:15.606 --> 16:18.268
I'm here to celebrate a deal
with my newest client.

16:18.442 --> 16:20.307
You guys have always treated me
just right.

16:22.313 --> 16:25.146
- I thought you said I was blue chip.
- Ha, ha.

16:25.382 --> 16:27.748
We're all good. Hey, we're all good.

16:27.918 --> 16:31.911
I just paid you a 3.5-Million-dollar
commission. And you bring me here?

16:32.089 --> 16:34.523
This is not
how I heard Mr. Carl rolls.

16:40.197 --> 16:42.165
Something you need
to understand about Mr. Carl.

16:42.700 --> 16:44.133
What's that?

16:44.301 --> 16:45.393
He likes to party.

16:52.509 --> 16:55.171
Mm-hm. What did I tell you?

16:58.549 --> 17:00.642
What I'm talking about.

17:02.519 --> 17:04.214
Welcome, gentlemen.

17:05.856 --> 17:07.323
Hello.

17:08.358 --> 17:09.484
Blue chip, you liking this?

17:09.660 --> 17:11.685
I'm liking it a lot, baby. Whew.

17:11.862 --> 17:13.522
Thank you.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.499
- How you doing tonight?
- I am good.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.398
- Yeah?
- This is my first time here.

17:21.571 --> 17:24.006
You know Mr. Carl, he's the man.

17:24.174 --> 17:25.334
We're celebrating.

17:28.846 --> 17:31.337
- Krug Reserve?
- Mm-hm.

17:32.016 --> 17:33.506
You know who told me
about this place?

17:33.684 --> 17:36.983
Ray. You know Ray, don't you?

17:40.257 --> 17:41.383
Give me one second.

17:53.671 --> 17:55.332
On your 6.

18:03.981 --> 18:05.005
Sam.

18:12.423 --> 18:13.981
Get up.

18:14.992 --> 18:17.051
Why are the Southland Kings
after Ray Martindale?

18:17.361 --> 18:18.419
Who are you guys?

18:18.595 --> 18:21.120
- I'm Mr. Carl.
- He likes to party.

18:21.298 --> 18:24.199
Hey, Sam, this Taser still charged?

18:24.368 --> 18:25.392
Ray's a snitch.

18:25.569 --> 18:27.093
Were you in business with him?

18:27.271 --> 18:29.034
Not me personally.

18:29.440 --> 18:32.409
- Look, I just follow orders.
- Who told you Ray was still alive?

18:32.576 --> 18:34.476
- Was it Nelson Sanders?
- No.

18:34.645 --> 18:37.079
Sanders is doing day one of a 20-year
bid. Can't hurt you.

18:37.247 --> 18:39.511
I ain't scared of Sanders.

18:41.518 --> 18:43.008
It was Ray's wife.

18:47.624 --> 18:50.752
She called the Southland Kings this
morning and told them Ray was alive.

18:50.928 --> 18:53.522
If that's true, it's conspiracy
to commit first-degree murder.

18:57.067 --> 18:58.932
- Okay, cuff me.
- What?

18:59.770 --> 19:01.965
She knows Max, not me.

19:02.139 --> 19:04.767
Ray met Nicole three years ago.
He was working undercover,

19:04.942 --> 19:08.173
he didn't want her to know he was
an informant, so I covered for him.

19:26.363 --> 19:28.831
- Max?
- Hey.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.331
Make yourselves comfortable.

19:31.502 --> 19:32.696
I can't believe this.

19:32.870 --> 19:33.928
What are you doing here?

19:34.505 --> 19:36.166
Feds busted down my door.

19:36.607 --> 19:39.508
Ray's on the run.
They think we know where he went.

19:39.676 --> 19:42.372
Were you always such
a drama queen?

19:42.579 --> 19:44.342
I like what you did with your hair.

19:44.681 --> 19:46.273
- So sweet.
- Seriously.

19:46.450 --> 19:48.008
Couldn't tell it was a weave at first.

20:02.466 --> 20:04.593
They're probably watching.

20:05.202 --> 20:06.226
And you care?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.141
Ray.

20:19.116 --> 20:21.914
You gotta help me figure out
what's going on with Ray.

20:23.420 --> 20:25.854
These feds are serious
and I cannot go back to jail.

20:26.623 --> 20:28.682
Nicole, look at me.

20:32.029 --> 20:33.690
A cop turned Ray.

20:34.231 --> 20:38.668
Convinced him to testify
against Nelson Sanders.

20:40.170 --> 20:41.660
Ray told you that?

20:42.372 --> 20:43.600
Yeah.

20:43.774 --> 20:46.106
The feds had this plan
to relocate him.

20:46.276 --> 20:47.766
I didn't wanna go.

20:48.879 --> 20:51.143
Before the trial,

20:51.415 --> 20:53.042
I got a call from this guy.

20:53.217 --> 20:56.948
He said that if I helped him find Ray,

20:57.788 --> 20:59.915
he'd pay me a hundred grand.

21:01.058 --> 21:05.927
I didn't do it,
but he left me his number.

21:10.901 --> 21:12.391
Hey.

21:12.569 --> 21:14.161
It's okay.

21:17.307 --> 21:21.266
If I tell the truth,
they won't send us to jail, right?

21:24.081 --> 21:26.948
Maybe you and I
could start hanging out again?

21:34.591 --> 21:36.491
I'd like that.

21:42.199 --> 21:44.497
Ray pulled up to the house
in a rental car.

21:44.701 --> 21:48.068
He needed some money
he'd stashed away.

21:49.773 --> 21:51.206
Did he say what he needed it for?

21:52.776 --> 21:54.607
He wants to relocate with someone.

21:54.778 --> 21:57.770
Some little tramp who works
at Grand Central Market, Jenna.

21:57.948 --> 21:59.506
At the bakery stand.

21:59.716 --> 22:02.617
Well, it's the first time
I've ever heard about her.

22:02.786 --> 22:04.276
Yeah.

22:04.721 --> 22:06.348
So I called that man back.

22:08.592 --> 22:12.153
I said I wanted the money
and I told him where Ray was headed.

22:17.768 --> 22:20.532
That selfish son of a bitch,
he doesn't deserve to be happy.

22:21.505 --> 22:23.598
Max, I'm glad that Ray's gone.

22:24.775 --> 22:26.037
I'm glad you're back.

22:40.757 --> 22:42.816
Whew. God.

22:47.564 --> 22:50.032
Eric's started to search
Grand Central Market for this girl,

22:50.200 --> 22:51.360
but it could take some time.

22:51.535 --> 22:54.766
It's okay, I know her.
I'll head over there.

22:55.172 --> 22:57.003
Max knows her.

22:59.476 --> 23:00.568
What?

23:02.312 --> 23:03.745
I'm fine, really.

23:03.914 --> 23:05.882
You're fine out here
or you're fine in there?

23:06.817 --> 23:10.651
Because the only thing in there I saw
that wasn't real was your alias.

23:10.821 --> 23:12.550
And even that,
I'm not so sure about.

23:14.157 --> 23:17.558
When I got the flu, the L.A.P.D.
Didn't bring me chicken soup, she did.

23:19.229 --> 23:21.322
I'm in control.

23:22.532 --> 23:24.090
Okay.

23:24.534 --> 23:27.230
Go get this Jenna girl
and bring her in.

23:37.347 --> 23:39.611
You seem pretty close to this.

23:39.916 --> 23:42.578
I've been here before, I'm fine.

23:42.886 --> 23:45.081
You two have chemistry.

23:45.589 --> 23:47.250
It's a game.

23:47.424 --> 23:49.688
How many times have you put
on high heels and a dress

23:49.860 --> 23:51.953
to get a suspect to talk?

23:56.233 --> 23:58.064
Are you going to tell her the truth?

24:03.874 --> 24:05.466
I don't think she wants to hear it.

24:06.076 --> 24:07.839
But doesn't she deserve it?

24:23.927 --> 24:25.656
Okay.

24:27.297 --> 24:30.130
Okay, okay, okay.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.879
I wouldn't do it, Mr. Callen.

24:54.656 --> 24:55.680
Do what?

24:55.858 --> 24:57.325
Talk to Mr. Deeks.

24:59.394 --> 25:03.296
That lie he's living with Nicole is the
same one I lived with Kristin Donnelly.

25:04.399 --> 25:08.267
Maybe if someone had talked to me,
things would have been different.

25:08.437 --> 25:09.995
Would you have listened?

25:12.608 --> 25:14.803
Heh. No.

25:15.210 --> 25:18.008
You still think about her
and the boy?

25:21.683 --> 25:23.844
Thanks for the advice, Hetty.

25:29.258 --> 25:31.192
The Southland Kings want Ray dead

25:31.360 --> 25:33.453
and we can't protect him
if we can't find him.

25:33.629 --> 25:35.563
I combed through every inch
of Ray's file

25:35.731 --> 25:37.562
and his phone records dating back
five years,

25:37.733 --> 25:40.099
no links
to known Southland Kings members.

25:41.236 --> 25:42.396
What do you got, Nell?

25:42.571 --> 25:44.903
Oh, lab got us
the M4's serial number.

25:45.073 --> 25:47.234
It's from that Pendleton shipment
we've been chasing.

25:47.409 --> 25:49.240
Sanders must have sold them
to Southland Kings

25:49.411 --> 25:51.971
before he got arrested.
Now we know who took possession.

25:52.147 --> 25:54.206
I think it's time
we paid Sanders a visit.

25:54.783 --> 25:57.343
- Gonna need you on this, Nell.
- Okay.

25:57.753 --> 26:01.086
Eric, I'm gonna need all the files
we've got on Sanders,

26:01.256 --> 26:02.450
the Southland Kings and Ray.

26:03.392 --> 26:04.416
The network is secure.

26:04.593 --> 26:06.959
- I'm sending you the files now.
- All right.

26:07.262 --> 26:10.163
Sanders has done business with Ray
and the Southland Kings,

26:10.365 --> 26:12.333
but nothing that links
all three parties together.

26:12.501 --> 26:14.128
There's a reason
why they want him dead.

26:14.303 --> 26:17.170
Ray couldn't testify against the
Southland Kings even if he wanted to.

26:17.372 --> 26:19.431
He doesn't have the intel unless...

26:19.775 --> 26:21.902
Nelson Sanders told them
that Ray did?

26:22.077 --> 26:24.739
That's not bad.

26:24.913 --> 26:27.381
Maybe we need to get her away
from her desk more often.

26:28.383 --> 26:29.645
I heard that, rock star.

26:34.923 --> 26:36.686
All right, I'll go talk to her.

26:36.892 --> 26:39.759
And I'll stay here, like last time,
right?

26:39.928 --> 26:42.988
If Max shows up with a new girlfriend,
people will start asking questions.

26:43.165 --> 26:46.532
But you didn't have to go undercover
back at the pool hall.

26:46.702 --> 26:49.603
I saw Ray from the car. We could
have just staked the place out.

26:49.771 --> 26:52.103
So, what are you saying,
you think I like being Max?

26:52.274 --> 26:54.538
Some days, it's easier
being someone else.

26:55.344 --> 26:56.641
And some days, it's too easy.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.504
Deeks...

27:08.557 --> 27:10.320
There you go.

27:12.294 --> 27:14.023
Hey, Jenna.

27:14.363 --> 27:16.422
Hi, Max.

27:17.833 --> 27:18.891
Sorry about Ray.

27:19.067 --> 27:21.058
Yeah, right.

27:21.236 --> 27:23.568
You okay?
Thought you'd be more upset.

27:23.739 --> 27:26.173
Uh, well...

27:28.010 --> 27:29.375
Kensi, I got Ray in the market.

27:30.145 --> 27:32.340
He's running. I'm going after him!

27:36.051 --> 27:37.746
Hey, Ray!

27:41.890 --> 27:43.721
Ray!

27:43.892 --> 27:45.917
Slow down, crazy punk!

27:46.094 --> 27:47.152
Ray!

28:00.742 --> 28:02.232
Damn it.

28:06.415 --> 28:08.406
Hey. Stop it.

28:12.688 --> 28:14.178
Ray!

28:19.294 --> 28:21.854
Stop it.
I'm on your side, you dumb-ass.

28:22.030 --> 28:26.262
In case you haven't noticed, everybody
I've ran into today has tried to kill me.

28:26.435 --> 28:29.199
- You think I'm trying to kill you?
- No.

28:29.371 --> 28:32.272
Maybe you wanna arrest me.
That could happen.

28:32.441 --> 28:33.533
Should I be arresting you?

28:33.709 --> 28:37.577
Look, I don't know, I haven't paid
a parking ticket in about 14 years.

28:37.746 --> 28:39.213
Look, I was gonna say something.

28:39.381 --> 28:40.473
Why are the Southland Kings

28:40.649 --> 28:42.082
- trying to kill you?
- Whoa, whoa.

28:42.250 --> 28:44.050
Can't protect you
if you don't tell the truth.

28:44.219 --> 28:47.052
Look, I am telling the truth! All right?

28:47.222 --> 28:49.884
I never dealt with them,
never even met any of them.

28:50.158 --> 28:51.216
Are you okay?

28:51.526 --> 28:54.893
Yeah, baby, it's gonna be okay,
I promise, all right?

28:55.330 --> 28:56.729
Why did you come back?

28:58.033 --> 28:59.466
I need her to come with me.

28:59.935 --> 29:00.959
Why?

29:02.938 --> 29:04.269
She's pregnant.

29:11.980 --> 29:13.675
Come on, man,
why didn't you just tell me?

29:13.849 --> 29:15.407
I found out this morning.

29:15.684 --> 29:18.152
You told me I could only bring
my immediate family

29:18.320 --> 29:21.653
when I went into relocation,
no exceptions.

29:21.823 --> 29:24.348
I knew if you saw us together,
we could tell you...

29:24.559 --> 29:26.652
And there'd be no way
I could say no.

29:28.196 --> 29:30.323
I got a chance to be a dad.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.997
You know what this means to me.

29:35.771 --> 29:36.829
Yeah, I do.

29:37.372 --> 29:40.603
It's gonna be different for my kid,
not like it was for us.

29:43.311 --> 29:46.508
I can do this, Marty, I know I can.

29:47.215 --> 29:50.378
I'm not leaving L.A. Without her,
unless it's in a body bag.

29:55.357 --> 29:58.884
It's gonna be all right.
Just hang in there.

30:05.834 --> 30:08.132
Well, I have to admit it was smart.

30:08.303 --> 30:10.032
It's a bold move.

30:11.706 --> 30:12.730
Enlighten me.

30:13.041 --> 30:15.202
You found out Ray wasn't dead.

30:15.377 --> 30:17.709
He was never gonna testify
against the Southland Kings,

30:17.879 --> 30:19.813
but you scared them
into thinking he would.

30:19.981 --> 30:22.040
You're locked up,
but you want revenge.

30:22.217 --> 30:24.811
Figured the Salvadoreans
would kill him just to be safe,

30:24.986 --> 30:27.511
do your dirty work for you.

30:28.557 --> 30:30.184
Come back when you got proof.

30:30.358 --> 30:34.988
I may have sold some weapons
in the past to the Southland Kings,

30:35.163 --> 30:37.154
but I never dealt with them
personally.

30:37.332 --> 30:39.232
One dose of proof coming up.

30:40.569 --> 30:42.264
Two weeks
before you were arrested,

30:42.437 --> 30:46.601
NCIS observed you
with a Southland Kings chieftain,

30:46.775 --> 30:48.072
who's wanted for murder.

30:52.647 --> 30:55.241
If you stop the Salvadoreans,

30:55.417 --> 30:59.217
I'll inform the Russians that Ray's
been called to testify against them.

30:59.387 --> 31:01.514
If they fail to kill him,
I'll go to the Serbs.

31:01.690 --> 31:06.684
If the Serbs fail, I'll go to the Italians
and on and on.

31:08.096 --> 31:11.930
Who do you think these men
will trust more, me or you?

31:12.267 --> 31:14.064
All this for revenge?

31:14.236 --> 31:18.229
I'm spending the next 20 years
in prison because of Ray Martindale.

31:20.876 --> 31:24.175
You'll have to move on
to the next case eventually.

31:24.479 --> 31:28.609
New crimes,
new problems to manage.

31:29.618 --> 31:32.746
But I only have one problem
to focus on,

31:33.822 --> 31:36.120
and I'll never stop until it's solved.

31:36.691 --> 31:38.625
I believe you.

31:39.327 --> 31:41.386
We're finished here.

31:53.575 --> 31:54.599
It's done.

31:55.977 --> 31:58.070
Jenna's at a motel with armed guards.
She's safe.

32:03.585 --> 32:04.984
Nicole still in love with you?

32:06.488 --> 32:08.513
I'm not blind, man.

32:08.723 --> 32:11.248
It's always been obvious.

32:11.426 --> 32:12.484
Hey, it could work.

32:13.295 --> 32:15.456
Yeah, maybe if things were different,
Ray.

32:16.998 --> 32:18.329
She doesn't even know who I am.

32:19.167 --> 32:21.431
Does Wikipedia know who you are?

32:21.603 --> 32:23.036
Okay, easy, she's just my partner.

32:23.238 --> 32:24.967
What are you guys talking about?

32:25.140 --> 32:29.372
Nothing, we're just discussing
the pertinent details to the case.

32:30.111 --> 32:31.373
Okay.

32:32.347 --> 32:33.837
But you two got a thing.

32:34.015 --> 32:36.347
No, man. No, there's no thing.

32:36.518 --> 32:39.453
Listen,
I know when I go into relocation,

32:39.621 --> 32:41.885
- we're not gonna be able to talk.
- It's gonna be nice.

32:42.057 --> 32:44.150
But you gotta make me a promise.

32:44.326 --> 32:46.385
You gotta call me someday

32:46.895 --> 32:49.523
and let me know
how it turned out with her.

32:52.067 --> 32:54.399
Scoobies are back.

32:54.569 --> 32:56.628
Did you guys figure out
my happy-ever-after?

32:56.805 --> 32:58.466
We got good news and bad news.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.871
We've confirmed you're not connected
to the Southland Kings.

33:02.210 --> 33:04.838
Oh, I could have told you that.
In fact, I did tell you that.

33:05.013 --> 33:06.810
This is his idea of good news?

33:06.982 --> 33:09.246
The bad news is, Nelson Sanders
will keep sending people

33:09.417 --> 33:11.647
to kill you until you're dead.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.515
Doesn't matter
where we relocate you.

33:13.688 --> 33:15.485
It's a matter of time
before they succeed.

33:15.790 --> 33:19.385
You know what? Next time, just tell me
I'm screwed and pop a cap in my ass.

33:19.561 --> 33:22.655
All right,
take it easy. They got a plan. Right?

33:22.831 --> 33:23.855
You got a plan?

33:24.933 --> 33:27.925
The Southland Kings bought those
military-issue weapons from Sanders.

33:28.103 --> 33:29.832
They're gonna come after you again,
Ray.

33:30.005 --> 33:32.064
And fortunately,
we can control where.

33:32.374 --> 33:33.932
Oh, so that's the plan?

33:34.109 --> 33:36.577
You're gonna use him as bait
to lure them out?

33:36.745 --> 33:39.737
No. You just say no, all right?
They can't force you to do it.

33:39.914 --> 33:43.315
They need you to volunteer and we're
gonna figure something else out.

33:47.555 --> 33:49.614
What about Jenna?

33:49.824 --> 33:53.954
If anything happens to you, Jenna
and your child will be protected for life.

33:55.463 --> 33:56.760
You have our word.

33:59.067 --> 34:00.193
Ray.

34:00.635 --> 34:02.466
No.

34:07.609 --> 34:08.632
I'm in.

34:25.626 --> 34:28.288
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:29.062 --> 34:30.927
Someone's been behaving.

34:31.098 --> 34:32.531
What do you mean?

34:32.699 --> 34:33.927
No cuffs.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.342
You know,
Ray and I always used to joke

34:44.511 --> 34:47.536
about how easily we could have
ended up with the other guy's life,

34:47.714 --> 34:50.683
and I think the thing
is that maybe I wanted his life

34:50.851 --> 34:52.079
more than I wanted to admit.

34:53.887 --> 34:56.947
Oh, this is not
how I imagined this going.

35:03.597 --> 35:05.087
My name isn't Max.

35:06.600 --> 35:10.195
I am a cop.

35:11.305 --> 35:12.966
I met you
when I was working undercover

35:13.140 --> 35:14.607
and Ray was my informant.

35:25.485 --> 35:27.919
How much of it was real?

35:34.361 --> 35:35.726
I don't know.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.831
You're a coward.

35:43.337 --> 35:44.634
Yeah.

35:45.372 --> 35:47.272
Why are you telling me this
right now?

35:48.942 --> 35:51.911
Because those guys
still wanna kill Ray.

35:52.079 --> 35:54.274
I can't let that happen
and I need your help.

36:04.524 --> 36:06.958
I need you to call the men
that want Ray dead.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.253
I need you to tell them
you just saw him

36:09.429 --> 36:12.398
and that he's meeting a bagman
at this location in an hour.

36:12.733 --> 36:14.360
Nicole.

36:16.103 --> 36:18.936
And you'll tell your people
I cooperated?

36:33.553 --> 36:35.248
I'm sorry.

36:38.625 --> 36:41.685
I know that life has not been easy
since you met me.

36:48.835 --> 36:51.395
Somehow you still managed
to be the best thing in it.

37:02.749 --> 37:03.807
Kens, what do you see?

37:05.652 --> 37:07.916
I got a green SUV
headed towards Ray.

37:08.088 --> 37:10.022
Are you sure Ray knows
where to take cover?

37:10.323 --> 37:12.450
I sure hope so.

37:23.937 --> 37:25.495
Federal agents. Drop your weapons.

37:37.684 --> 37:39.379
Ray!

37:39.553 --> 37:41.282
Damn it.

37:50.363 --> 37:51.887
Deeks, move, now!

37:52.065 --> 37:53.828
Time to go, bro.

38:00.907 --> 38:02.033
Go, we got you covered.

38:02.209 --> 38:04.302
Plan B, Deeks! Plan B!

38:07.514 --> 38:09.004
Go.

38:11.384 --> 38:12.408
Go.

38:17.290 --> 38:19.520
Instructions and an address
are on the dash.

38:19.693 --> 38:21.354
I'm gonna have agents waiting
for you.

38:21.528 --> 38:23.428
They'll take you on a charter flight
to Oregon.

38:23.597 --> 38:25.497
What about Jenna?

39:10.210 --> 39:11.768
Drop the weapon. On the ground.

39:11.945 --> 39:12.969
Now!

39:18.652 --> 39:20.483
Deeks.

39:21.454 --> 39:23.285
Come on.

39:45.445 --> 39:48.005
I hope they bought
that car swap, Marty.

39:48.181 --> 39:49.409
Yeah. Me too.

39:49.583 --> 39:53.451
I'm gonna be the best father
in the world, I promise you.

39:53.887 --> 39:56.822
- I know you are, Ray.
- Shut up and listen to me.

39:56.990 --> 39:59.891
I'm not gonna screw everything up
like my dad or your dad.

40:01.795 --> 40:04.263
Always knew we'd turn out
so much better than them.

40:05.899 --> 40:06.991
We did, didn't we?

40:07.534 --> 40:09.798
Damn right, brother.

40:12.606 --> 40:13.630
Take care of him.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.769
I will.

40:22.449 --> 40:24.178
You promised me that phone call,
Marty.

40:24.351 --> 40:25.409
No.

40:25.785 --> 40:28.379
I wanna hear how your thing turns out
with Wikipedia.

40:28.555 --> 40:31.388
You know you owe me that much.

40:31.558 --> 40:32.957
There is no thing.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.923
Thank you.

40:45.038 --> 40:47.506
Some guys hit the gym
to relieve stress.

40:47.674 --> 40:49.642
I total cars and blow them up.

40:50.644 --> 40:54.080
And who's the rock star?

40:54.581 --> 40:55.639
Yeah.

41:08.895 --> 41:11.762
Thank you for letting Ray take Jenna
with him.

41:11.965 --> 41:15.526
No one should live out his life alone,
including you.

41:15.702 --> 41:17.966
What are you talking about?
I got you. I'll be fine.

41:22.275 --> 41:24.038
I have a message for you.

41:26.212 --> 41:28.077
From Nicole Martindale.

41:31.718 --> 41:32.742
Does she hate me?

41:32.919 --> 41:34.409
Actually, yes.

41:36.723 --> 41:39.055
But she also wants you to know

41:39.292 --> 41:41.726
that she has no regrets.

41:48.902 --> 41:50.631
Yeah, I guess I don't either.

41:59.579 --> 42:01.308
Good night, Mr. Deeks.

42:04.551 --> 42:06.212
Night, Hetty.

42:18.398 --> 42:19.729
Just heard from L.A.P.D.

42:19.899 --> 42:22.732
First call the Southland Kings shooters
made was to Sanders.

42:22.902 --> 42:25.837
They confirmed Ray's death.
He's safe now.

42:26.339 --> 42:28.534
Sanders was gonna get
what he wanted eventually.

42:28.908 --> 42:30.739
Only way for us to win
was to give it to him.

42:32.545 --> 42:36.948
What is this I hear about you guys
tearing apart a clandestino? Hmm?

42:37.117 --> 42:39.847
I mean, certain places, you
gotta crack heads, I understand that,

42:40.053 --> 42:41.918
but a clandestino,

42:42.088 --> 42:46.149
I think that requires a lighter touch.

42:46.559 --> 42:49.494
Deeks has a point. You have
to be aware of the cultural customs.

42:49.662 --> 42:53.189
For example, clandestinos originated
in Nicaragua.

42:53.366 --> 42:54.856
Good night, Wikipedia.

42:56.770 --> 42:59.204
And, uh, lighter touch,

42:59.639 --> 43:05.305
next time you feel like introducing
us to one of your friends, don't.

43:08.281 --> 43:09.771
Planning on calling Ray
any time soon?

43:09.949 --> 43:12.713
No. No, I'm not.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.688
- Why do you ask?
- Just when you do,

43:15.855 --> 43:17.015
tell him Wikipedia says hi.

43:19.159 --> 43:20.183
I'll do that.

43:20.360 --> 43:24.854
Oh, and, um,
I'm glad our thing is working out.

43:28.902 --> 43:30.836
No thing.

43:32.906 --> 43:35.170
There is no thing!
