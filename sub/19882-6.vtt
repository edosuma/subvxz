00:05.833 --> 00:08.082
What's the skinny
on the truck heist?

00:08.083 --> 00:09.541
The street went
dark on that one.

00:09.542 --> 00:10.832
Bob Fink was here yesterday.

00:10.833 --> 00:11.833
He didn't find the gold though.

00:11.834 --> 00:13.666
I moved it to Father John's.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.457
So, what's the price to keep
my commodity safe and sound?

00:15.458 --> 00:17.291
That depends on the value
of the commodity.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.791
I need something, um...
unexpected.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.749
- A bathtub.
- A solid gold bathtub.

00:22.750 --> 00:25.249
- So, can you do it? Make a gold bathtub?
- I'll give it a crack.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.125
Albert Hill!
You've been a naughty boy!

00:30.833 --> 00:33.332
Lily Hill, I am arresting you on
possessing prohibited weapons.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.874
- We need to get out of town.
- My family's place

00:34.875 --> 00:36.416
in the country.
I hope it's comfy, Charlie,

00:36.417 --> 00:37.697
'cause we might
be there a while.

<i>When the gold free-for-all was</i>
declared in the summer of '01,

00:50.667 --> 00:53.542
<i>everyone knew it was gonna</i>
get a little naughty.

00:56.792 --> 00:59.499
Oi, love, move out the way!

00:59.500 --> 01:02.000
<i>But no one was prepared</i> for the
rank slaughter that followed.

01:03.583 --> 01:06.457
<i>It played out like</i>
a gangland's who's who

01:06.458 --> 01:08.582
<i>kicking off</i>
with the Topper Clan.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.666
<i>But the gold wouldn't</i>
keep quiet.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.957
<i>And the Worthington Crew</i>
heard the whispers.

01:13.958 --> 01:16.457
<i>And by the time</i>
the leaves started falling,

01:16.458 --> 01:18.000
so did the Toppers.

01:23.125 --> 01:27.291
<i>Jury's still out on who ironed</i>
out the Worthington Crew.

01:27.292 --> 01:31.416
Maybe the Harriston Yardies.

01:31.417 --> 01:33.000
Maybe the Maripole Ladies.

01:35.417 --> 01:38.874
<i>Makes no once</i>
who did what and when?

01:38.875 --> 01:41.999
They're all history now.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.874
<i>The gold changed hands</i>
over a dozen times

01:43.875 --> 01:48.666
<i>as whole gangs</i>
were wiped from the map.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.125
All for a lump of metal.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.082
No!

02:17.083 --> 02:18.999
<i>Although I've never known</i>
a curse that could out-muscle

02:19.000 --> 02:21.166
<i>that most basic</i>
of all human instincts...

02:21.167 --> 02:22.542
greed.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.332
<i>Does he have the stones,</i>
the diamonds?

02:35.333 --> 02:37.375
<i>Where are you</i>
taking the diamonds?!

02:56.667 --> 02:57.750
Wow.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.332
Cousin Monty was a pimp!

03:11.333 --> 03:14.124
Well, actually,
an Earl to be precise.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.582
If your Cousin is an Earl,
what does that make you?

03:16.583 --> 03:19.000
Well, nothing more
than the cousin of an Earl.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.166
Your money or your life, scum!

03:26.167 --> 03:28.041
Shit.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.249
God!

03:29.250 --> 03:31.166
This is spectacular, Charlie.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.999
Would you like a tour, Chloe?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.042
I'd love one.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.999
Oi, Charlie boy!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.666
Where's the booze?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.957
Yeah, the...
Head east through the parlor.

03:42.958 --> 03:45.166
The wine cellar is through an
oak door down some stairs.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.707
Pick a full-bodied red.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.166
The dustier
the bottle the better.

03:48.167 --> 03:51.125
Got it, mate.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.374
Are you not forgetting
something?!

03:58.375 --> 04:01.917
Like a 10 million pound gold
bathtub in the back of the van!

04:03.958 --> 04:05.957
312!

04:05.958 --> 04:07.916
Cell 313!

04:07.917 --> 04:09.666
Death, taxes, and count.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.916
The only certainties in life.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.707
And I intend to defy all three.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.416
Cell 314?

04:16.416 --> 04:18.832
We're right here, Screw,
exactly where you left us.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.166
Piece of shit.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.500
- What now?
- Go and have a fag.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.957
Spread the word, Hate 'Em.

04:31.958 --> 04:35.457
The Mad Hatters Tea Party
will commence tomorrow.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.833
We'll take the whole wing down
the rabbit hole, Vic.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.374
Who'd shoot a clergyman?

04:44.375 --> 04:46.624
Father John wasn't
exactly a saint.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.499
Gotta rap sheet longer
than the New Testament.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.291
Witness says they were
negotiating

04:50.292 --> 04:52.707
with a bunch of sheikhs over
what looked like a gold bath.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.666
A gold bath?

04:54.667 --> 04:56.332
Anything else?

04:56.333 --> 04:58.041
Yeah, he's given us a name.

04:58.042 --> 04:59.542
Bob Fink.

05:07.667 --> 05:10.332
Mrs. Hill, possessing an
unlicensed firearm

05:10.333 --> 05:12.374
is a very serious offense.

05:12.375 --> 05:14.583
So is planting evidence.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.667
I'll be taking my phone call now
if you don't mind.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.082
Come on, Lil,
have a look around.

05:27.083 --> 05:30.041
There's no mics, no cameras.

05:30.042 --> 05:31.291
Just a chat.

05:31.292 --> 05:35.207
I can make all of this go away.

05:35.208 --> 05:38.666
You can make
a fake charge go away?

05:38.667 --> 05:41.332
Forgive me
while I hold the applause.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.249
Have you any idea
just how much shit

05:43.250 --> 05:45.249
your boy and his mates are in?

05:45.250 --> 05:47.332
I mean, there's enough naughty
on this list

05:47.333 --> 05:49.332
to give Santa a stroke.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.832
He goes away, it'll make
his old man's stretch

05:50.833 --> 05:53.832
look like a weekend in Margate!

05:53.833 --> 05:57.457
All I want is
a word with Albert.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.832
Straighten up this mess.

05:59.833 --> 06:00.833
Do a deal.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.624
Keep everyone happy.

06:03.625 --> 06:06.249
Can't you see I'm trying
to throw you a line here?

06:06.250 --> 06:07.750
I want my phone call.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.666
Call your boy.

06:18.667 --> 06:20.542
I'm calling my lawyer.

06:26.833 --> 06:30.333
I'll give you some more time
to consider my proposition.

06:37.833 --> 06:41.125
And finally,
this is the master bedroom.

06:46.417 --> 06:48.292
Charlie...

06:49.500 --> 06:52.291
This is beautiful.

06:52.292 --> 06:55.541
Yeah, well...
Sleep here if you like.

06:55.542 --> 06:57.374
No...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.332
No, I really couldn't.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.416
Could I?

07:01.417 --> 07:02.667
- Call shotgun.
- Shotgun!

07:09.375 --> 07:12.166
Wow.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.499
Yeah, well, I'm,
I'm gonna go to...

07:14.500 --> 07:17.124
light the fire.

07:17.125 --> 07:20.333
Come down to the library when
you've... finished spinning.

07:44.417 --> 07:47.374
Tell you what, I could get used
to this, Charlie.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.207
Certainly in no rush to leave.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.999
Well, it's too hot to go home
now anyway, isn't it?

07:51.000 --> 07:52.499
Yeah, well, it's been
a rough week.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.332
I say we get absolutely
hammered.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.457
Whoa!

07:57.458 --> 07:58.792
Think we can help with that.

08:01.500 --> 08:02.667
Whoo!

08:07.583 --> 08:09.417
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.000
Whoo!

10:08.917 --> 10:10.957
Fun and games today, boys?!

10:10.958 --> 10:12.999
Fun and games, today!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.124
Matinee movie, Hate 'Em?!

10:14.125 --> 10:16.041
Special features, chaps.

10:16.042 --> 10:17.875
And you don't want to miss it.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.041
Hey.

10:30.042 --> 10:32.667
Someone's messing
with the tea, over there.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.750
In the office now.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.707
He's put some shit in there,
I don't know what.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.041
Sounds like they
spiked the tea urns.

10:44.042 --> 10:45.999
Check the damn milk.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.582
<i>All inmates!</i>

10:47.583 --> 10:49.666
<i>Return to your cells</i>
immediately!

10:49.667 --> 10:53.417
<i>I repeat, all inmates return</i>
to your cells immediately!

10:59.917 --> 11:01.624
I need a coffee.

11:01.625 --> 11:04.291
Yeah, I need two coffees.

11:04.292 --> 11:05.999
I'm starving.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.166
Yeah, Charlie, where's the food?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.874
There is no food.

11:08.875 --> 11:10.999
I told you, no one's been
here in over two years.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.916
All right, keep your
toys in your pram.

11:12.917 --> 11:14.749
Is there a market nearby?

11:14.750 --> 11:16.999
Nearest village is...
About two miles away.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.582
- Fancy a drive?
- I could do with some air.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.874
Yeah, you can take
Cousin Monty's car.

11:22.875 --> 11:24.542
It's in the barn.

11:34.667 --> 11:36.457
Cousin Monty

11:36.458 --> 11:38.708
- really is a pimp!
- Yes, he is.

11:44.542 --> 11:46.582
So, seeing as we are both
in this together,

11:46.583 --> 11:48.707
maybe we should get to know
each other a little.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.207
What, ask a few questions

11:50.208 --> 11:51.792
and then we get
friendship bracelets?

11:52.833 --> 11:54.375
Do me a favor.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.541
You smoke?

11:58.542 --> 12:01.332
See, you're getting
to know me already.

12:01.333 --> 12:02.957
Alright, I'll play.

12:02.958 --> 12:05.166
What's a pretty girl
from New York

12:05.167 --> 12:07.999
doing working
for a fence like Saul Gold?

12:08.000 --> 12:10.499
Well, I went
traveling for a year.

12:10.500 --> 12:12.499
I always wanted to go to London.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.666
So, I ended up waitressing
at a coffee shop to pay my way.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.166
Saul walked in.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.666
Took a flyer off
the counter on anger management

12:19.667 --> 12:21.707
and offered me a job.

12:21.708 --> 12:24.666
Said he was doing one good
deed a day.

12:24.667 --> 12:26.291
Adventure comes to the
adventurous, right?

12:26.292 --> 12:29.083
So, I took him up on his offer.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.458
What's the real story, ay?

12:34.625 --> 12:37.166
We're out of wood.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.082
We need to go
and chop some logs.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.499
Chop some logs?
How do we do that?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.416
With an ax, you idiot.

12:42.417 --> 12:43.666
Who you calling an idiot?

12:43.667 --> 12:44.874
Well, there is only
one person here

12:44.875 --> 12:47.207
who doesn't know
how to chop logs.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.333
Have I done something
to offend you, Charlie?

12:51.542 --> 12:52.999
Do you know how to chop logs?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.292
Yeah, with an ax... you idiot.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.499
I had a very normal life.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.874
Decent parents,
did well at school.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.624
Never wanted for
anything really.

13:03.625 --> 13:07.082
It was a middle class life
with no real struggles at all.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.874
Ooh, sounds really boring.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.416
It was boring beyond belief.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.624
I hated my life.

13:13.625 --> 13:16.666
It was like a slow death.

13:16.667 --> 13:21.082
And what do your parents think
about you working for a fence?

13:21.083 --> 13:22.666
They think
I'm studying accounting

13:22.667 --> 13:24.208
at the London School
of Economics.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.832
I forged my graduation
certificate

13:26.833 --> 13:28.792
and sent it home last month.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.500
You're alright, Chloe Koen.

13:37.500 --> 13:39.166
So, what are we gonna
do about this gold bath?

13:39.167 --> 13:41.166
That was a bright
idea wasn't it.

13:41.167 --> 13:43.207
Actually, it was
a very good idea.

13:43.208 --> 13:44.916
Just not one your bird's had.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.999
Well, first of all, Charlie,
she ain't my bird.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.541
And secondly, she's the one

13:49.542 --> 13:51.249
who put us onto the gold
in the first place.

13:51.250 --> 13:52.582
Actually, technically,
she put us onto

13:52.583 --> 13:54.374
Sonny Castillo's truck.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.791
We happened upon that gold.

13:55.792 --> 13:57.916
And forget who has
and hasn't done what.

13:57.917 --> 14:00.082
We gotta think about what
we're gonna do with it now.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.666
Yeah, what are we gonna
do now, Maestro?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.874
Hole up in the country
and set up a commune?

14:04.875 --> 14:06.499
I'm thinking on my
feet here, aren't I?

14:06.500 --> 14:08.375
More like sleeping on your feet.

14:09.833 --> 14:12.166
What has gotten into you?

14:12.167 --> 14:13.499
He thinks you're
putting moves on her.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.832
Putting the moves on who?

14:14.833 --> 14:16.499
Chloe.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.249
I am not putting
the moves on Chloe!

14:18.250 --> 14:21.249
So what's the deal with
you and Albert then?

14:21.250 --> 14:23.166
Me and Albert?!

14:23.167 --> 14:25.167
Nothing, it is just business.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.582
You want to bang him.

14:27.583 --> 14:29.916
I do not want to bang him.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.875
I can see what's going on.

14:33.625 --> 14:37.291
Hushed conversations,
cuddles on the sofa.

14:37.292 --> 14:39.916
You put your arm around her.

14:39.917 --> 14:41.707
Tread carefully.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.542
The posh one's got
a hard-on for you.

14:44.833 --> 14:46.332
Charlie?

14:46.333 --> 14:48.041
You are properly
paranoid here, Charlie.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.999
He... he's probably obsessed.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.792
I'm not obsessed!

14:53.833 --> 14:55.291
I'm in love!

14:55.292 --> 14:57.499
No, he...

14:57.500 --> 15:00.833
he's just really so sweet.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.833
Charlie!

15:18.083 --> 15:20.124
You've known the girl
for five minutes!

15:20.125 --> 15:22.749
There is no time,
space or motion

15:22.750 --> 15:24.666
in the matter of the heart!

15:24.667 --> 15:26.041
But not that you would know
that, Billy,

15:26.042 --> 15:27.832
'cause yours is carved
out of solid oak.

15:27.833 --> 15:29.374
You're damn straight.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.999
Ain't nothing in those
fairy tales for me, mate.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.624
You couldn't leave this one
alone, could you?

15:33.625 --> 15:37.041
- Me?
- What chance would I have anyway?

15:37.042 --> 15:40.291
When Albert Hill rode into town
on his stallion...

15:40.292 --> 15:42.249
With his spurs jangling

15:42.250 --> 15:44.292
and his six shooter glistening
in the high sun.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.833
Just this one time!

15:50.958 --> 15:52.833
Just one bloody time.

15:55.042 --> 15:56.292
Charlie?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.458
Charlie!

16:03.667 --> 16:05.875
I want my bloody phone call!

16:08.542 --> 16:09.666
Who's that one?

16:09.667 --> 16:10.916
Lily Hill.

16:10.917 --> 16:13.332
- Vic Hill's wife.
- Yeah.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.166
Bob Fink brought her in.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.291
Fink brought her in?

16:18.292 --> 16:19.292
On what charge?

16:19.293 --> 16:21.666
Possession of illegal firearms.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.499
Left her in there all night.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.500
- He charge her yet?
- Not yet.

16:31.042 --> 16:32.957
What was all that about?

16:32.958 --> 16:35.166
What, are we still 14
fighting over girls?

16:35.167 --> 16:37.124
What you asking me for?

16:37.125 --> 16:39.832
Apparently I've got
a heart of wooden oak.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.792
Something bothering
you too, now, is it?

16:43.833 --> 16:46.332
Well...

16:46.333 --> 16:47.749
This whole thing has been one
cock up to the next,

16:47.750 --> 16:49.541
ain't it, really?

16:49.542 --> 16:51.583
Okay, so this
is all my fault, is it?

16:53.792 --> 16:55.832
Losing the fight?

16:55.833 --> 16:57.207
The Castillo heist.

16:57.208 --> 16:58.832
Father John getting ironed out.

16:58.833 --> 17:01.124
Bob Fink coming after us.
The gold bath tub.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.249
Listen, I apologize if my efforts
haven't quite gone to plan.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.749
But I haven't seen you trying to get
us ahead over the years, Billy.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.665
In case you want to know,
I look after everyone.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.165
Well, maybe I don't
want to get ahead.

17:11.166 --> 17:12.415
Maybe I'm alright where I am.

17:12.416 --> 17:14.665
Billy, you live in a closet.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.582
What's your excuse? You're a talented
fighter and you don't even train.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.124
You could have a run
at going pro.

17:18.125 --> 17:21.208
And who says I want
a run at going pro?

17:22.333 --> 17:24.124
That was always your idea.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.484
Yeah, well, one of us has got
to be ambitious, haven't we?

17:27.750 --> 17:29.207
That's not what this
is about, Al.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.499
What it is about then, Billy,
ay, tell me?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.999
It's about you and your
old man, always has been.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.957
You trying to prove
to him and everyone else

17:36.958 --> 17:38.332
that you can get one up on him.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.833
That you can live up
to the Hill name.

17:41.708 --> 17:43.166
My old man's got
nothing to do with this.

17:43.167 --> 17:46.583
Come on, Al.

17:48.417 --> 17:51.416
Heisting an armored
truck with a forklift?

17:51.417 --> 17:54.166
Ooh, that's straight
out of Vic Hill's handbook.

17:54.167 --> 17:57.874
Boiler suits? JCB's Masks?

17:57.875 --> 17:59.875
That's Vic Hill 2.0.

18:06.333 --> 18:10.000
You might wanna take a look
in the mirror... mate.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.000
Dailies, boys!

18:25.792 --> 18:28.167
As Hate 'Em said,
it's gonna be a mindbender.

18:34.833 --> 18:36.457
What's the problem here, gents?

18:36.458 --> 18:38.166
What's the problem?
Hoochin' the tea, you scumbag.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.541
Hoochin' what tea?
What you talkin' about?

18:40.542 --> 18:42.416
Come on, come here, you!

18:42.417 --> 18:43.457
Get off me!

18:43.458 --> 18:44.833
Come on, stop struggling.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.499
Like he said boys,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.375
Crossword's a mindbender.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.167
And you don't wanna miss it.

19:05.375 --> 19:09.500
- All in.
- All in.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.041
Hill! Get in there!

19:20.042 --> 19:21.332
Full lockdown.

19:21.333 --> 19:23.499
Haven't had
my morning cuppa yet.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.207
Your scheme to mass medicate
the wing

19:25.208 --> 19:26.832
has been brought
to my attention.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.793
I haven't a clue what you're
jabbering on about.

19:30.042 --> 19:32.042
A little bird whispered
the milk's off.

19:41.167 --> 19:43.666
Where is that filthy
midnight grass?

19:43.667 --> 19:44.832
I'll fuckin' shit him!

19:44.833 --> 19:45.874
You won't see him again.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.999
Transferred for loyal service.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.667
Dump the whole lot, lads!

19:51.667 --> 19:55.499
Oi! No morning tea?

19:55.500 --> 19:58.249
That's a breach of our human
rights, wouldn't you say?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.041
Now both of you,
back in your kennel.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.457
I want my brew,
and I want my paper now.

20:02.458 --> 20:03.957
Now!

20:03.958 --> 20:05.874
I do believe this prisoner's
become unruly.

20:05.875 --> 20:09.749
Never too early for a screw
bashing, now, is it, Screw, ay?

20:09.750 --> 20:12.291
Oi, Vic, you don't wanna
go back in the hole.

20:12.292 --> 20:14.249
These two were set
to boil up the wing!

20:14.250 --> 20:15.874
A kicking's
the least they deserve.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.332
You behave yourself.

20:17.333 --> 20:19.374
Listen...

20:19.375 --> 20:21.832
We need them out of here
quick and quiet.

20:21.833 --> 20:22.874
We don't want them
stirring up the mob.

20:22.875 --> 20:24.457
Stick 'em over in Barmy Wing.

20:24.458 --> 20:26.291
Spot of potion and they're
someone else's problem.

20:26.292 --> 20:27.499
I ain't going back to Loony bin.

20:27.500 --> 20:28.874
I ain't going back to Loony bin,

20:28.875 --> 20:31.500
no way, no way, no way!

20:40.500 --> 20:42.167
Vic! Vic!

20:48.000 --> 20:50.916
- I'll kill you.
- Everyone take 'em out! Out!

20:50.917 --> 20:53.208
Take 'em to the Barmy wing!

20:56.333 --> 20:59.041
Mr. Hill, you were due
to be out soon.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.082
But now you're due to receive
another 18 months

21:01.083 --> 21:03.500
for assaulting
a member of the prison staff.

21:05.208 --> 21:07.457
Why jeopardize your release?

21:07.458 --> 21:09.166
Screw deserved more than he got.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.957
But surely you want
to get out of here?

21:10.958 --> 21:13.124
Yeah, and miss
all this good fun?

21:13.125 --> 21:17.999
So, Henry, um,
looking at your folder...

21:18.000 --> 21:20.082
It's "Hate 'Em."

21:20.083 --> 21:21.999
Hate 'Em All Henry.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.791
Hate 'Em All Henry.

21:23.792 --> 21:28.749
Do you have reservations for
what life holds on the outside?

21:28.750 --> 21:31.332
I've been locked up
for 15 years.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.013
I wouldn't know where to get
a reservation.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.874
Anger management issues.

21:36.875 --> 21:40.166
Aggressive and violent
tendencies.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.499
When did it start, Henry?

21:42.500 --> 21:45.166
Have It All, what... Hate All...

21:45.167 --> 21:48.332
Hate 'Em All.

21:48.333 --> 21:50.957
Shut up.

21:50.958 --> 21:53.291
Are you scared, Vic?

21:53.292 --> 21:57.999
Scared what those expectations
might be?

21:58.000 --> 22:02.707
As a husband... as a father?

22:02.708 --> 22:05.375
Terrified.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.374
I miss my birds.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.124
I need you
to speak to the Guv'nor

22:13.125 --> 22:14.999
and ask him to give me
my birds back.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.374
What, what birds exactly are,
are you talking about?

22:20.375 --> 22:23.707
Well, Mr. Hill,
so far as I can gauge,

22:23.708 --> 22:26.499
you've experienced
extreme anxiety

22:26.500 --> 22:30.291
relating to your
imminent release.

22:30.292 --> 22:31.457
We call it gate fever.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.957
Sounds contagious.

22:32.958 --> 22:36.332
And you use humor
to deflect the anxiety,

22:36.333 --> 22:38.957
particularly relating
to the expectations

22:38.958 --> 22:41.582
put upon you
by your wife and son.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.332
I'm Vic Hill.

22:43.333 --> 22:45.291
I've had my fair
share of hard knocks.

22:45.292 --> 22:47.332
I've been down on the mat more
times than I can count,

22:47.333 --> 22:49.374
but I have never been licked
by expectations.

22:49.375 --> 22:51.499
What birds?
What you mean what birds?

22:51.500 --> 22:53.541
I, I, I think I'm gonna give
you a small dose...

22:53.542 --> 22:55.832
- You what?
- Help!

22:55.833 --> 22:57.416
Mr. Hill, I am going to give
you a small dose...

22:57.417 --> 22:59.166
Give me the drugs,
give me the drugs,

22:59.167 --> 23:00.687
give me the drugs,
give me the drugs...

23:36.458 --> 23:38.083
Give us them keys.

23:55.708 --> 23:56.832
Are you still there?

23:56.833 --> 23:58.542
No!

24:00.333 --> 24:03.332
No!

24:03.333 --> 24:06.083
Hold still, hold still.
There you go.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.707
You'll be asleep
in about five seconds.

24:10.708 --> 24:12.583
Good night.

24:15.875 --> 24:17.541
Yeah, Hate 'Em All.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.833
And don't forget it.

24:43.833 --> 24:45.791
White chocolate.

24:45.792 --> 24:46.917
My favorite.

24:53.042 --> 24:55.332
Dailies, boys!

24:55.333 --> 24:57.166
Crossword's a mindbender.

24:57.167 --> 25:00.374
Like he said, boys,
crossword's a mindbender.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.083
And you don't wanna miss it.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.166
Let's get ourselves out.

25:28.167 --> 25:29.500
Come on.

25:50.417 --> 25:51.707
Fly!

25:51.708 --> 25:53.374
Fly free, you nutters!

25:53.375 --> 25:55.667
Fly free, you nutters!

27:59.000 --> 28:00.333
Hey, come here.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.166
Coming through, doctors,
coming through.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.542
Doctors coming through.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.916
Injured officer!
Injured officer.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.249
Injured officer!

28:16.250 --> 28:18.166
Injured officer, coming through!

28:18.167 --> 28:19.874
Injured officer,
injured officer.

28:19.875 --> 28:21.166
- Are you all right?
- Injured officer.

28:21.167 --> 28:22.332
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes.

28:22.333 --> 28:23.582
Wonderful, wonderful.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.499
That's very... yes.

28:25.500 --> 28:27.167
Vic, you drive.

28:29.083 --> 28:32.167
Injured officer,
injured officer.

28:39.917 --> 28:42.208
You did it.

28:50.833 --> 28:52.500
What the hell?

28:56.917 --> 28:59.541
Bloody hooligans.

28:59.542 --> 29:00.999
Scooter?

29:01.000 --> 29:02.749
Scooter?!

29:02.750 --> 29:04.082
Come on, boy.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.124
Where are you, boy?

29:05.125 --> 29:06.458
Scooter?!

29:28.292 --> 29:30.166
Good boy.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.332
What are you doing, ay?

29:32.333 --> 29:34.666
Good boy.

29:34.667 --> 29:35.958
Flying Squad.

29:38.125 --> 29:39.458
Dwyer.

29:52.708 --> 29:55.374
Chief Superintendent Jones.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.666
A horse got out of the paddock
this afternoon, sir.

29:58.667 --> 30:00.249
Vic Hill escaped.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.374
Took a guard hostage
and staged a riot.

30:02.375 --> 30:04.666
Vic Hill...

30:04.667 --> 30:06.207
Well, it's par for the course.

30:06.208 --> 30:07.999
He's as mad as a box of frogs.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.707
Sir, the very man who hijacked
the gold bullion

30:09.708 --> 30:11.499
in the first place is now
walking the pavement

30:11.500 --> 30:14.166
at the precise moment
that same gold bullion

30:14.167 --> 30:16.124
has staged its comeback tour.

30:16.125 --> 30:17.832
Interesting timing,
I'll say you that.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.916
Interesting timing.
It's Vic Bloody Hill.

30:20.917 --> 30:24.207
The gold has been on the
streets for seven days.

30:24.208 --> 30:27.207
And you have
how many leads, exactly?

30:27.208 --> 30:30.082
We don't have a solid lead
as of yet, sir, but...

30:30.083 --> 30:31.999
Then I suggest...

30:32.000 --> 30:36.958
You focus your attention on
finding and locating Hill.

30:38.875 --> 30:41.166
He may be more effective
at locating the gold

30:41.167 --> 30:43.375
than your entire unit, Dwyer.

30:44.750 --> 30:45.750
And Dwyer?

30:45.750 --> 30:46.750
Sir?

30:48.000 --> 30:49.374
Screw this up, and I'll put you

30:49.375 --> 30:52.125
over my knee and take
my pound of flesh.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.417
Understood, sir.

31:09.208 --> 31:10.375
Hello, fellas.

31:11.500 --> 31:13.374
What have got here, then?

31:13.375 --> 31:14.957
Nice touch, good boy.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.291
There's one in there for you,
too, Vic.

31:16.292 --> 31:17.541
Great, thanks.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.124
So, what's the crack now then?

31:19.125 --> 31:20.666
Well, by now they'll think
we're taking you hostage

31:20.667 --> 31:21.999
'cause we made sure the knife

31:22.000 --> 31:23.499
was good and clear
on the cameras.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.582
When you go down to the nick,

31:25.583 --> 31:27.166
tell 'em we played nice,
all right?

31:27.167 --> 31:28.582
Will do. Don't you worry.

31:28.583 --> 31:29.999
I'll spin a nice yarn
for you boys, all right?

31:30.000 --> 31:31.291
Good boy.

31:31.292 --> 31:33.208
And this is just
to make it look real.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.291
Bloody 'ell.

31:36.292 --> 31:37.541
That's twice you clocked me now.

31:37.542 --> 31:38.916
Don't worry,
you'll thank us for it.

31:38.917 --> 31:40.917
Early retirement,
all the trimmings!

31:42.417 --> 31:46.083
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

31:47.667 --> 31:49.458
Wrap him up, wrap him up.

32:13.042 --> 32:15.832
It may have all
changed around here, Vic.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.167
Some things never change,
Hate 'Em.

32:20.792 --> 32:21.916
What happened here then?

32:21.917 --> 32:23.457
Probably vandals.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.178
This would never have
happened on our watch.

32:34.833 --> 32:36.124
Lily?!

32:36.125 --> 32:37.249
I could murder a pint now.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.500
Yeah, you read my mind, Dear.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.542
Morning, morning.

33:04.333 --> 33:06.667
Well, hey...!

33:10.167 --> 33:12.750
Let's have him.

33:16.542 --> 33:18.333
Hands up in the air!
This is a robbery!

33:22.042 --> 33:23.791
Afternoon, Alf.
Everything in order?

33:23.792 --> 33:25.667
Vic Hill! Hate 'Em All Henry!

33:26.833 --> 33:28.041
When did you two get out?

33:28.042 --> 33:30.582
About... 37 minutes ago.

33:30.583 --> 33:32.999
I take it not
out the front door?

33:33.000 --> 33:34.624
As a matter of fact, we did.

33:34.625 --> 33:35.957
Through the front door, Alf.

33:35.958 --> 33:37.499
I get you, less said, right.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.957
Okay, drinks.

33:38.958 --> 33:40.457
Thought you wouldn't ask, Alf.

33:40.458 --> 33:42.666
Two pints for me.
Vic, what you having?

33:42.667 --> 33:45.832
Single malt.
The good stuff mind.

33:45.833 --> 33:48.332
All right. No-no-no-no.

33:48.333 --> 33:50.166
This is on the house, gents.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.499
Very kind of you, Alf,
thank you.

33:51.500 --> 33:54.041
So, what's new in the manor?

33:54.042 --> 33:55.042
Yeah, what's not?

33:55.043 --> 33:56.416
Everyone's disappeared.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.124
They're either in the ground
or inside.

33:58.125 --> 34:00.916
What about the crew that
flipped that security truck?

34:00.917 --> 34:02.624
Any word on the metal?

34:02.625 --> 34:04.249
It's a mystery.

34:04.250 --> 34:05.624
Not so much as a whisper.

34:05.625 --> 34:07.207
- Not a whisper.
- No, nothing.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.998
- Quiet as a mouse.
- I thought you two would know.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.208
Nothing to do with us.

34:14.208 --> 34:16.541
You all right, Albert?

34:16.542 --> 34:18.167
Yeah, I'm all right.

34:21.292 --> 34:23.000
It's quite something, isn't it?

34:25.917 --> 34:28.581
You reckon
it'll change anything?

34:28.583 --> 34:30.456
I think what
will change anything?

34:30.458 --> 34:32.333
Selling the gold,
all that money?

34:34.583 --> 34:36.791
Yeah.

34:36.792 --> 34:37.831
We'll be rich.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.666
And that matters does it?

34:40.667 --> 34:44.916
Honestly... I've got no idea.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.123
I've never really had a bean.

34:47.125 --> 34:49.416
Me neither.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.831
There is a simple answer,
though.

34:51.833 --> 34:53.498
Which is?

34:53.500 --> 34:56.331
Well, we sell the gold,
get the money and find out.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.958
That's the most sense
I've heard all day.

35:13.750 --> 35:16.292
Charlie? What's wrong?

35:20.167 --> 35:22.999
Me.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.083
I'm what's wrong.

35:30.083 --> 35:31.874
Do you take me seriously, Chloe?

35:31.875 --> 35:33.999
Of course I take
you seriously, Charlie.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.167
No, I, I mean... in that way?

35:39.833 --> 35:41.666
Well, I... We haven't...

35:41.667 --> 35:45.333
Sorry, that was...
not fair of me to ask.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.207
- Boss.
- Oi.

36:00.208 --> 36:01.707
Lily Hill, what cell is she in?

36:01.708 --> 36:03.416
Well, she's gone, sir.

36:03.417 --> 36:04.666
There's nothing
on the charge sheet.

36:04.667 --> 36:06.249
I had to let her go
this afternoon.

36:06.250 --> 36:07.749
Go where?
Who signed her release?

36:07.750 --> 36:09.042
Flying Squad.

36:10.875 --> 36:12.708
Lily.

36:22.625 --> 36:23.999
You keep an eye out front.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.291
If the plod show up
send me a smoke signal.

36:26.292 --> 36:28.291
Don't you worry, Vic,
I've got you covered.

36:28.292 --> 36:30.166
If I'm not back
in half an hour...

36:30.167 --> 36:31.832
Run free, Lassie.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.833
Run free.

37:24.458 --> 37:25.917
Lily?

37:28.667 --> 37:30.042
Whoo.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.167
Let's eat, guys.

37:42.667 --> 37:44.791
Well?

37:44.792 --> 37:48.041
We didn't cook all this bloody
food for it to go cold.

37:48.042 --> 37:49.458
Okay.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.791
Toast.

37:53.792 --> 37:58.457
Yeah, here's to you
and here's to me.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.499
The very best
that friends can be.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.124
And if we ever disagree...

38:05.125 --> 38:07.875
Well, piss off and here's to me.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.374
Okay.

38:18.375 --> 38:22.541
Well, it's in the most
difficult times

38:22.542 --> 38:24.542
that we learn who
our true friends are.

38:27.833 --> 38:31.624
Whether we've known each other
for ten days...

38:31.625 --> 38:33.667
or ten years.

38:34.792 --> 38:37.832
There's one absolute truth.

38:37.833 --> 38:40.957
Despite all of us feeling
this excruciatingly

38:40.958 --> 38:44.707
painful shit shock
of the last 48 hours.

38:44.708 --> 38:47.582
There's nowhere I'd rather be
then right here,

38:47.583 --> 38:51.874
drinking this really,
really nice wine

38:51.875 --> 38:56.457
at Cousin Monty's...

38:56.458 --> 38:58.417
with all of you.

39:01.833 --> 39:03.042
To friends.

39:04.667 --> 39:07.166
Friends.

39:07.167 --> 39:08.332
Yeah.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.707
To friends.

39:09.708 --> 39:11.457
Friends.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.375
Now tuck in.

39:23.667 --> 39:24.667
Shit!

39:24.668 --> 39:26.958
- What?
- It's my mum.

39:28.625 --> 39:30.167
She's been arrested.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.541
So, you coming or what?

39:39.542 --> 39:41.541
Seems like you and Chloe
got it covered.

39:41.542 --> 39:43.499
I'll stay out the way. Charlie,
we don't have time for this.

39:43.500 --> 39:45.999
- Please get in the van.
- No.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.207
I'm gonna stay here
for a day or two.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.416
Clear the mind.

39:49.417 --> 39:51.000
You're getting
this all wrong, mate.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.499
- Let's go.
- Charlie not coming?

40:00.500 --> 40:02.291
Apparently not.

40:02.292 --> 40:03.832
What are we gonna do
about that thing?

40:03.833 --> 40:05.124
We're gonna take it
back to Uncle Dean.

40:05.125 --> 40:07.124
It's too risky to take
back into town.

40:07.125 --> 40:09.957
Tell the sheikh we're gonna
need a new buyer.

40:09.958 --> 40:11.198
He's gonna have to re-smelt it.

40:22.292 --> 40:23.542
Guinness up.

40:31.333 --> 40:33.541
You gonna eat that or what?

40:33.542 --> 40:36.457
All yours, Hate 'Em.

40:36.458 --> 40:38.292
Lovely.

40:43.333 --> 40:45.333
How'd she leave
without her purse?

40:48.125 --> 40:50.457
Well, there's...

40:50.458 --> 40:52.333
Some unsavory characters out
there, Vic.

40:54.042 --> 40:56.875
None of whom seem
to remember who we are.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.292
Need a place
to hole up, Hate 'Em.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.374
Who do we know
that would welcome us

41:04.375 --> 41:07.832
into their loving embrace?

41:07.833 --> 41:08.999
A bit more vino?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.416
No, thank you, Norm.

41:11.417 --> 41:12.917
That was amazing, thank you.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.999
Don't sound so surprised.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.124
When you've lived on your tod
for as long as I have,

41:18.125 --> 41:22.832
takeaways and TV dinners
lose their appeal.

41:22.833 --> 41:24.500
Anybody in the mix, Norman?

41:25.917 --> 41:28.416
Now, that's a nice
thought Lil, but...

41:28.417 --> 41:29.417
I think that boat's sailed.

41:29.418 --> 41:30.999
Nah...

41:31.000 --> 41:34.582
And to be honest,
I haven't really been looking.

41:34.583 --> 41:36.125
Why not?

41:39.583 --> 41:41.792
Why do you think, Lil?

41:46.542 --> 41:48.667
Norman...

41:53.083 --> 41:54.874
Norman, please don't
look at me like that.

41:54.875 --> 41:57.625
Lily, it's time you knew
how I feel about...

42:01.000 --> 42:02.707
Expecting visitors?

42:02.708 --> 42:04.167
No.

42:11.417 --> 42:13.958
Blimey! What are you doing here?

42:15.792 --> 42:17.291
We broke out.

42:17.292 --> 42:19.957
- You broke out?
- Nice to see you, yeah.

42:19.958 --> 42:22.124
It's good to see you, Vic,
but, you know, I've really...

42:22.125 --> 42:23.291
It's not a very good time.

42:23.292 --> 42:24.416
You sly old fox.

42:24.417 --> 42:26.082
Who you hiding in the boudoir?!

42:26.083 --> 42:28.333
- No, no, it's just...
- Hello? Come on out, darling!
