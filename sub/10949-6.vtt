19:21.790 --> 19:24.670
It's... Too much.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.380
( GASPS AND COUGHS )

19:28.460 --> 19:30.050
Please...

19:32.090 --> 19:35.590
Without you,
all my plans are suddenly possible.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.550
I have a vision for the future, Roku.

19:44.390 --> 19:45.440
( COUGHING )

19:58.450 --> 20:01.660
( SCREECHES )

20:09.080 --> 20:12.880
( BABY CRYING )

20:12.960 --> 20:16.680
AANG: Who's... Wait, that's me, isn't it?

20:16.970 --> 20:19.010
ROKU: Make sense of our past, Aang.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.310
And you will bring peace
and restore balance in the world.

20:24.470 --> 20:25.600
Roku?

20:26.020 --> 20:28.150
Roku...

20:29.350 --> 20:32.690
SOZIN: <i>With Roku gone,</i>
<i>and the great comet returning</i>

20:32.900 --> 20:36.030
<i>the timing was perfect
to change the world.</i>

20:36.650 --> 20:40.070
<i>I knew the next Avatar
would be born an air nomad.</i>

20:40.820 --> 20:43.790
<i>So I wiped out the air temples.</i>

20:43.870 --> 20:46.540
<i>But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me.</i>

20:47.500 --> 20:51.840
<i>I wasted the remainder
of my life searching in vain.</i>

20:52.040 --> 20:54.300
<i>I know he's hiding out there somewhere,</i>

20:54.500 --> 20:57.550
<i>the Fire Nation's greatest threat.</i>

20:57.630 --> 21:00.300
<i>The last airbender.</i>

21:03.850 --> 21:07.020
That can't be it, where's the rest of it?

21:15.860 --> 21:17.820
You sent this, didn't you?

21:18.070 --> 21:19.740
I found the secret history.

21:19.910 --> 21:23.330
Which, by the way, should be renamed
"The History Most People Already Know."

21:23.870 --> 21:26.580
The note said that I needed to know
about my great-grandfather's death,

21:26.870 --> 21:28.410
but he was still alive in the end.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.830
No. He wasn't.

21:31.670 --> 21:33.540
What are you talking about?

21:33.630 --> 21:36.920
You have more than one great-grandfather,
Prince Zuko.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.880
Sozin was your father's grandfather.

21:40.130 --> 21:44.640
Your mother's grandfather was Avatar Roku.

21:45.890 --> 21:47.430
Why are you telling me this?

21:47.640 --> 21:52.310
Because understanding the struggle
between your two great-grandfathers

21:52.400 --> 21:56.780
can help you better understand
the battle within yourself.

21:59.110 --> 22:02.660
Evil and good are always
at war inside you, Zuko.

22:02.820 --> 22:05.370
It is your nature, your legacy.

22:05.660 --> 22:08.330
But, there is a bright side.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.790
What happened generations ago
can be resolved now.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.630
By you.

22:15.750 --> 22:21.170
Because of your legacy, you alone
can cleanse the sins of our family,

22:21.260 --> 22:23.050
and the Fire Nation.

22:23.510 --> 22:26.470
Born in you, along with all this strife

22:26.680 --> 22:31.310
is the power
to restore balance to the world.

22:36.060 --> 22:39.190
This is a royal artifact.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.660
It's supposed to be worn
by the crown prince.

22:52.710 --> 22:55.920
KATARA: You mean, after all Roku
and Sozin went through together,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.670
even after Roku showed him mercy,
Sozin betrayed him like that?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.760
It's like these people are born bad.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.300
AANG: No, that's wrong.

23:04.590 --> 23:07.100
I don't think that was the point
of what Roku showed me at all.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.930
Then what was the point?

23:09.260 --> 23:12.140
Roku was just as much Fire Nation
as Sozin was, right?

23:12.520 --> 23:16.400
If anything, their story proves anyone's
capable of great good and great evil.

23:16.940 --> 23:19.610
Everyone, even the Fire Lord
and the Fire Nation,

23:19.690 --> 23:21.900
have to be treated like
they're worth giving a chance.

23:22.490 --> 23:24.530
And I also think it was about friendships.

23:25.700 --> 23:29.030
Do you really think friendships
can last more than one lifetime?

23:30.660 --> 23:32.370
I don't see why not.

23:32.500 --> 23:35.620
SOKKA: Well, scientifically speaking,
there's no way to prove that...

23:35.710 --> 23:37.750
Oh, Sokka, just hold hands.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.680
