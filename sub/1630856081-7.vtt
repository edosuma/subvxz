WEBVTT

00:18.143 --> 00:19.519
Luggage is all in.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.439
Oh, well, are you sure you
don't want to change your mind?

00:22.522 --> 00:26.109
After all, state dinner with
the prime minister of Japan.

00:26.192 --> 00:29.029
I hung up
my diplomatic shoes long ago.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.656
I'll pass
on this busman's holiday.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.158
This is Julia's moment.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.119
Besides, Paul and I
have plans of our own.

00:36.202 --> 00:38.621
Try and behave yourselves.

00:38.705 --> 00:42.876
Yes, I know,
like asking a lion not to roar.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.085
I'm so proud of you.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.378
- Mm.
- Mwah.

00:45.462 --> 00:47.297
OK, let's load in.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.799
Benny, you take
the first two-hour shift.

00:49.883 --> 00:52.010
Russ, you are up next.

00:52.093 --> 00:55.388
Julia, you navigate in shotgun,
followed by me.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.516
Fair warning, I am known
to have no sense of direction.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.187
But my general instinct
is to head south.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.944
Give our regards
to Lyndon and Lady Bird.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.238
♪ 100 bottles of Bordeaux
on the wall ♪

01:12.322 --> 01:15.325
♪ 100 bottles of Bordeaux ♪

01:15.408 --> 01:17.285
Doesn't she look just divine?

01:17.369 --> 01:18.411
Oh, hush.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.996
I want her unvarnished opinion,

01:20.080 --> 01:22.207
not your
financially motivated one.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.877
- Well?
- Well, you look gorgeous,

01:25.960 --> 01:29.047
but gorgeous is a given
and maybe not the whole point.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.216
What does it look like?

01:31.299 --> 01:32.592
A bunch of daffodils.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.511
Perhaps it's not obvious

01:34.594 --> 01:35.679
to the uninitiated,

01:35.762 --> 01:38.056
but a hothouse flower,
I am not.

01:38.139 --> 01:39.057
Of course you're not.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.975
There is a dinner
being given

01:41.059 --> 01:43.228
in honor
of the Knopf Publishing House,

01:43.311 --> 01:46.146
which I founded with my husband
50 years ago.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.109
I want a dress that says that.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.151
Uh...

01:50.235 --> 01:52.696
Formidable,
consequential,

01:52.779 --> 01:54.489
and elegant.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.825
Maybe Chanel.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.118
I'll see what I can do.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.169
Child residence.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.506
Child residence
number one, perhaps,

02:11.589 --> 02:15.802
but I am looking
at Child residence number two.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.762
Simca.

02:17.846 --> 02:21.349
Painter,
photographer, diplomat.

02:21.433 --> 02:23.768
You are an architect too, Paul.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.478
To anyone
but a real architect.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.521
Nonsense.

02:26.603 --> 02:29.441
This is perfection absolue.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.693
Ah, the proportions.

02:31.776 --> 02:34.362
Well, I am
rather proud of it.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.198
And I have
the ideal contractor.

02:37.281 --> 02:39.534
And in a year,
it'll be ready.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.536
And you will spend
all your time here.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.748
Oh, I would love that,

02:44.831 --> 02:45.999
as much time as we can.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.459
Things are busy here too.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.546
Oh, yes.
Good to hear that.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.423
Can Julia spare a moment?

02:54.299 --> 02:55.841
Julia isn't here.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.469
She's at the White House.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.971
The White House?

03:00.055 --> 03:02.015
She was invited
to do a television special

03:02.098 --> 03:04.059
about the making
of a state dinner

03:04.142 --> 03:05.643
with the president

03:05.727 --> 03:07.812
and the prime minister
of Japan.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.400
I know.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.694
It kind of takes
your breath away.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.529
Apparently,
Theodore Roosevelt

03:16.613 --> 03:19.949
and Mark Twain
spent time at this place.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.659
Together?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.036
Not that I know of.

03:23.119 --> 03:24.954
We're part of history, my dear.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.333
Well, I don't know
what those two men

03:28.416 --> 03:31.753
plan to do while in residence,
but...

03:31.836 --> 03:33.421
my plan is to call Paul,

03:33.505 --> 03:35.632
order room service,
and head to bed.

03:36.508 --> 03:40.220
Well, take time
to look at the view too.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.474
Oh.

03:46.685 --> 03:50.313
Bernard wrote speeches
for Adlai Stevenson, you know.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.233
That's the closest I ever got
to the White House.

03:54.942 --> 03:56.444
Not very close.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.534
You know what I wish right now?

04:02.617 --> 04:07.163
I wish we had daughters,
you and I,

04:07.247 --> 04:11.543
daughters to whom we could say,
look what your mothers did.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.380
Look where your mothers are.

04:18.048 --> 04:19.426
That's funny.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.514
I was just thinking
I wish my father were alive.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.812
Mrs. Child,
Gretchen Fletcher.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.647
Mr. Morash,
Gretchen Fletcher.

04:32.731 --> 04:34.315
Mrs. Naman,
Gretchen Fletcher.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.152
Oh, no, that's me.
I'm Alice Naman.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.612
- I'm so sorry.
- It's no problem.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.406
On the contrary,
it's against protocol

04:41.489 --> 04:43.742
to misidentify any official
visitor to the White House.

04:45.284 --> 04:47.454
Well, we're all
for protocol here.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.621
In what context?

04:48.705 --> 04:50.999
Whatever.
Life.

04:52.207 --> 04:53.710
Hmm.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.253
Let me be the first
to welcome you.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.547
I'm the deputy White House
chief of protocol.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.424
The mission of our office
is to advance

04:59.507 --> 05:01.051
the foreign policy goals
of the United States

05:01.134 --> 05:03.636
by creating an environment
for successful diplomacy.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.973
It's like a recipe,
isn't it, Gretchen?

05:07.057 --> 05:08.224
Protocol.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.101
The closer you follow it,
the less likely you are

05:10.185 --> 05:11.561
to burn the house down.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.608
OK, I will be
accompanying you

05:16.691 --> 05:19.069
through your schedule
over the next two days.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.904
You'll meet with members
of the White House staff.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.739
We've allotted for two visits
to the kitchen

05:22.822 --> 05:24.491
to track the preparation
of the meal.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.617
Oh, that's splendid.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.243
You'll note
the ceremonial arrival

05:27.327 --> 05:28.495
of the prime minister,

05:28.578 --> 05:31.956
all culminating, of course,
at dinner tomorrow night

05:32.040 --> 05:34.125
with the president
and the first lady.

05:36.252 --> 05:37.170
And you are?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.255
Avis DeVoto,
Gretchen Fletcher.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.132
Avis DeVoto.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.886
No.

05:44.969 --> 05:47.722
I'm afraid your security
clearance has hit a snag.

05:47.806 --> 05:48.848
A snag?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.725
You haven't been cleared
for this level of access.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.979
Who are you, Avis DeVoto?

05:55.063 --> 05:58.942
I've done a few things
in my life of which I'm proud.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.111
It's the anti-war agitation,
isn't it?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.362
You'd have to ask
the Secret Service.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.322
- Can you introduce me?
- No.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.159
But I can offer you the
10:00 a.m. White House tour.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.577
It's very informative.

06:09.661 --> 06:10.745
Oh, no.

06:10.829 --> 06:11.955
She's come all this way.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.207
No, it's fine, really.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.625
It's a badge of honor.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.377
And you've got a show to make.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.213
I will take
that informative 10:00 tour

06:20.296 --> 06:23.258
and get a next train
back to Boston.

06:23.341 --> 06:26.136
We're very pleased
to have the rest of you here.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.221
I haven't seen your show,
Mrs. Child,

06:28.304 --> 06:31.474
but the briefing book suggests
that America...

06:31.558 --> 06:32.600
trusts you.

06:32.683 --> 06:34.936
Well, trust
is the key to diplomacy.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.397
Shall we get on with it?

06:46.197 --> 06:47.949
You've done this before,
have you?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.577
Well, not for years.

06:50.659 --> 06:52.996
You learn a lot of skills
in the foreign service,

06:53.079 --> 06:54.831
not all of them useful.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.584
I was on the team...

06:57.667 --> 06:59.127
briefly.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.545
Were you?

07:00.628 --> 07:03.173
Well, that's imbalanced.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.050
- No, you first.
- All right.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.977
These lanes are well-oiled.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.939
You don't see that
in most local alleys.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.900
Well, you know what?

07:21.983 --> 07:25.904
The truth is, I don't feel
much like bowling anymore.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.908
Oh, well, we may have come
to the wrong place.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.702
Well, bowling was an excuse.

07:32.786 --> 07:37.165
You know, we roll a few frames
poorly, like men do.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.918
Have a few beers,
tell a few off-color jokes,

07:40.001 --> 07:41.336
like men do,

07:41.419 --> 07:43.797
talk about baseball,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.007
mowing the lawn,
barbecuing.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.509
These men sound awful.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.678
A few more beers,
and the talk

07:49.761 --> 07:53.139
would turn
to more substantial things.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.224
Such as?

07:54.307 --> 07:57.560
I don't know, our marriages.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.317
You seem to have
the best marriage I know,

08:04.401 --> 08:06.736
maybe the only
really good marriage.

08:07.946 --> 08:11.116
You know how bowling
is essentially

08:11.199 --> 08:15.412
a thing you do alone together?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.205
That's me and Tilly.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.666
That's my marriage.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.003
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.632
Well, she doesn't like
being with other people,

08:27.716 --> 08:29.467
slightly agoraphobic.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.136
That didn't matter
in the old days at GBH.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.889
No one invited us anywhere,
anyway.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.893
Now with Julia
and "The French Chef,"

08:38.977 --> 08:41.479
my life has gotten much bigger,

08:41.563 --> 08:44.983
and hers has gotten smaller.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.236
And most of the time,
she just spends the days

08:48.319 --> 08:49.904
with her twin sister.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.031
Oh, the knitter?

08:52.490 --> 08:55.160
I'm the third wheel
in my own marriage.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.247
While we're waiting
for all of these crazy lights

08:59.330 --> 09:00.623
- to be set up...
- Yes.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.750
Why don't you two
take the time

09:01.833 --> 09:02.917
to get to know each other?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.502
Well, I already know Julia.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.463
There's no introduction
needed there.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.591
This is my first time
on the television.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.802
A social secretary is
invisible, usually speaking.

09:12.886 --> 09:16.389
There are no cameras
right now, Bess, just us.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.976
So tell me,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.228
what does a social secretary
of the White House

09:22.312 --> 09:23.396
do every day?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.982
Oh, all the unimportant
things, the invitations,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.735
the decorations,
the seating plans.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.819
Well, that sounds marvelous.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.237
If you like throwing
dinner parties.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.156
I do.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.286
But I'll tell you a secret.

09:38.370 --> 09:41.706
I may have the most important
job in the world.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.249
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.501
Now, how's that?

09:44.584 --> 09:46.795
At tomorrow's dinner
with the prime minister,

09:46.878 --> 09:48.672
nothing will be decided

09:48.755 --> 09:50.632
and no business will get done,

09:50.715 --> 09:54.302
and yet, because of it,
these two men who carry

09:54.386 --> 09:57.138
the weight of the world
on their shoulders

09:57.222 --> 09:59.557
will begin to trust each other.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.851
And so the next day,
it will be easier

10:01.935 --> 10:04.312
to reach agreements that make
the world better and safer.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.690
Just because
they broke bread together?

10:06.773 --> 10:07.691
Exactly.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.484
That's what I do every day.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.570
Well, that seems to be
what so many women do

10:12.654 --> 10:14.072
behind the scenes:

10:14.155 --> 10:18.201
smooth the way without anyone
paying particular attention.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.745
Isn't it just?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.389
Well done.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.770
This is Henry Haller,
renowned Swiss chef

10:45.854 --> 10:48.898
who arrived at the White House
just two years ago

10:48.982 --> 10:51.985
to cook for the president
and Mrs. Johnson.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.571
Right now,
Chef Haller is preparing

10:54.654 --> 10:58.575
tomorrow's dinner in honor
of the prime minister of Japan.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.536
How many guests are you
expecting, Chef Haller?

11:01.619 --> 11:03.163
120.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.706
Well, that's a lot
of appetites.

11:04.789 --> 11:07.375
It is, and we do this
three or four times a week

11:07.459 --> 11:08.543
with no mistakes.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.295
Like a Swiss watch.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.130
Precisely.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.007
It's quite a responsibility.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.133
I don't think about that.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.926
I think only,
it must not be too salty

11:17.010 --> 11:20.305
and the prime minister of Japan
is allergic to strawberries.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.974
Oh, that's good to know.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.894
Well, I believe you may have
one of the most important jobs

11:25.977 --> 11:27.520
at the White House, Chef.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.064
No, no, I just make the stew.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.690
Well, dinners
at the White House

11:30.774 --> 11:33.777
are in good hands
with Chef Haller at the helm

11:33.860 --> 11:38.740
of the most consequential
kitchen in the world.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.824
Cut.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.744
- That was great.
- These are sloppy.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.371
Are you rushing
to get upstairs?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.872
Is that it?

11:45.955 --> 11:47.999
Do it again.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.213
Alfred.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.214
Come in.

11:54.297 --> 11:55.674
Judith.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.009
So exciting
about tomorrow night.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.303
I heard you spent
yesterday morning

12:00.387 --> 12:01.846
dress shopping with my wife.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.265
She can't do it
alone anymore,

12:04.349 --> 12:07.727
and she so wants to look
just right for the event.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.437
Isn't the dress perfect?

12:09.521 --> 12:11.564
I haven't seen the dress.

12:11.648 --> 12:14.484
I could hire someone to babysit
Blanche for $2 an hour.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.070
I don't need my best editor
wasting her time.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.281
I'm happy to lend a hand,
and all the work gets done.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.868
I'm taking you
off her list entirely.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.579
Oh, no.

12:26.663 --> 12:27.664
No, don't do that.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.166
Please, Alfred.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.419
Blanche has no other options
but me.

12:32.502 --> 12:34.421
Retirement,

12:34.504 --> 12:36.464
fading away,

12:36.548 --> 12:37.966
which she's doing anyway.

12:45.598 --> 12:46.850
What are you doing here?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.353
That's a long, crazy story

12:50.437 --> 12:54.482
better told with a stiff drink
on a soft couch.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.819
Who is that, Stanley?

12:57.902 --> 13:00.321
Tell them to go away.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.492
- Uh-oh.
- Uh-oh?

13:04.576 --> 13:05.702
Uh-oh.

13:07.996 --> 13:08.997
Who are you?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.086
Well, one of you
must know who she is.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.091
I--

13:20.175 --> 13:23.470
I am a student
of Professor Lipschitz.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.512
Cum laude.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.765
Sweetheart,
how laude is irrelevant.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.350
It's not as bad as it looks.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.768
Really?

13:29.851 --> 13:32.103
I'm not in love with her
or anything.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.521
How old is she?

13:33.605 --> 13:35.106
She's 25.
She knows nothing.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.400
- I do go to Harvard.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.860
It was a terrible mistake,

13:38.943 --> 13:41.154
a one-time--
I won't ever see her again.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.281
- Really?
- Except in lab twice a week.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.866
That's supposed
to make me feel better?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.326
It makes me feel a lot worse.

13:46.409 --> 13:47.952
Stop talking.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.954
This is who
you replace me with,

13:50.038 --> 13:51.623
a person
who means nothing to you?

13:51.706 --> 13:55.460
Oh, Stanley,
you can do better than that.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.092
To a day.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.927
To a day.

14:05.512 --> 14:09.724
But how strange life is
and how marvelous sometimes.

14:09.808 --> 14:10.934
- Hmm.
- Two years ago,

14:11.017 --> 14:13.353
I thought I was done
doing useful things.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.437
Tell me about it.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.939
Then you called.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.482
And you answered.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.443
Thank you,

14:20.527 --> 14:23.738
both of you,
for bringing me with you.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.074
And to think I thought
this show was a dead end.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.118
Some dead end.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.953
It would be none of us
without all of us.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.705
I'll drink
to almost anything

14:31.788 --> 14:34.332
but particularly to that.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.594
Give me five minutes.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.471
You have three.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.140
Then I splash vermouth
in your face

14:50.223 --> 14:51.599
and leave you with the check.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.649
I'm a very closed-off man,
Avis.

15:01.026 --> 15:04.279
And you opened me up

15:04.362 --> 15:09.159
to feelings, love,

15:09.242 --> 15:10.910
also sex.

15:12.954 --> 15:16.458
I like that a lot.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.044
Then you were gone, and...

15:19.127 --> 15:20.712
she was right there.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.548
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.051
I know why men cheat, Stanley.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.218
Of course you do.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.764
The cheating was not about you,

15:30.847 --> 15:33.475
how I feel about you.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.018
It was about me.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.063
You still mean everything
to me.

15:38.146 --> 15:40.607
Isn't that what really matters?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.442
No.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.111
No, it isn't.

15:45.195 --> 15:49.532
The fact that it changes
nothing for you doesn't help.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.494
It changes things for me.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.997
You're...emotionally dangerous.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.582
You made a mistake once.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.585
I let myself be vulnerable,
and you hurt me.

16:00.669 --> 16:03.630
That's true,
but that was at the beginning.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.716
And the beginning
is different from now.

16:06.800 --> 16:07.801
It is.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.261
You're right.
Good point.

16:10.345 --> 16:11.471
But...

16:14.349 --> 16:17.227
This is not me,

16:17.310 --> 16:19.145
not all of me, anyway.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.316
You...

16:23.400 --> 16:25.235
stupid idiot.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.321
That's what breaks my heart.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.740
What I have to do

16:30.824 --> 16:32.242
breaks my heart.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.705
You have to go.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.892
Hey, Benny and Lloyd
are already on the South Lawn

16:57.976 --> 17:00.478
getting ready for the arrival
of the prime minister

17:00.562 --> 17:03.440
and the military band,
all the pomp and circumstance.

17:04.566 --> 17:05.692
It's incredible.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.944
I'll meet you in
the famous kitchen right after?

17:08.028 --> 17:09.820
Deal.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.156
Biggest day of our lives.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.490
It is.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.534
OK, let's do this.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.708
We really might have
slept in at this point.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.209
For two hours.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.963
My beautiful ankles are
starting to hate these shoes.

17:28.965 --> 17:32.260
And for the record,
I could eat a horse.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.680
OK, no more grousing.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.183
Let us remember
what a momentous day this is,

17:38.266 --> 17:41.227
what an opportunity,
and remain grateful.

17:41.311 --> 17:43.229
Agreed.

17:43.313 --> 17:45.648
Oh, poor Warren Harding,

17:45.732 --> 17:48.735
condemned to a forgotten
hallway for eternity.

17:48.818 --> 17:49.861
So are we.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.364
And we're not responsible
for Teapot Dome.

17:53.823 --> 17:57.202
Oh, Gretchen,
just the woman we wanted.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.953
Chef Haller is still
not ready for you.

17:59.037 --> 18:00.288
Of course.
Then we wait.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.831
But your colleague Russell

18:01.915 --> 18:03.291
is getting
some wonderful footage.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.335
Oh, that's splendid,
and meanwhile,

18:05.418 --> 18:07.712
might we trouble you
for a modest cup of--

18:09.964 --> 18:11.383
Well, manners
are not the same

18:11.466 --> 18:13.176
as protocol, apparently.

18:13.259 --> 18:15.720
Well, they could all learn
a thing or two from Paul.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.266
In his years of diplomacy,
he knew how to make

18:20.350 --> 18:23.353
everyone feel special.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.938
This is fun, isn't it?

18:25.021 --> 18:27.232
For me too.
I don't get to do this.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.401
Believe it or not, Julia
doesn't like Italian food.

18:29.484 --> 18:31.236
No. Pizza.

18:31.319 --> 18:32.654
Everybody likes pizza.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.948
You would think, right?

18:38.201 --> 18:41.788
So who's older, you or Millie?

18:41.871 --> 18:43.832
I am by two minutes.

18:43.915 --> 18:46.001
Millie says
that's why she's more fun.

18:46.084 --> 18:47.460
A riot.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.675
Charlie's older, but we might
as well have been conjoined.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.720
That's how it's felt
my whole life.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.431
He's attached to me
with invisible cords.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.977
It's like in one
of those sci-fi movies.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.563
Hunter doesn't understand.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.856
Well--

19:07.939 --> 19:09.816
no, I don't.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.027
Millie and I can't help it,
but it makes him jealous.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.112
Well, Julia was the same way.

19:14.195 --> 19:16.239
Used to drive her crazy.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.743
Is that why
you fired my sister?

19:19.826 --> 19:21.119
No.

19:23.288 --> 19:25.749
That's why I hired her,

19:25.832 --> 19:29.669
so I could share something
with the two of you.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.299
I fired her because
she's completely talentless.

19:34.382 --> 19:35.717
Who knew?

19:35.800 --> 19:38.178
I knew.
You could have asked me.

19:40.388 --> 19:41.890
I guess.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.353
Oh, look.
I figured this out.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.479
Look.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.230
Just put there.

19:49.314 --> 19:52.442
And then you roll it.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.736
See, it rolls right off.

19:54.819 --> 19:56.071
That's it.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.836
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me here.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.839
You have three minutes,
same as I gave Stanley.

20:14.923 --> 20:16.466
After that, I throw a--

20:16.549 --> 20:19.260
oh, coffee's too hot.

20:19.344 --> 20:20.595
Just talk fast.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.934
I just wanted to tell you
how much I admire you.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.686
The way that you
stood up to Stanley,

20:27.769 --> 20:32.190
you have so much poise
and dignity.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.442
It's frankly inspirational.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.239
That's what you
wanted to say,

20:39.322 --> 20:42.992
not, I'm sorry for sleeping
with your boyfriend?

20:43.076 --> 20:45.662
No, no, that--that--that too.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.580
I'm definitely sorry
about that.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.583
Although if I hadn't
slept with Stanley,

20:50.667 --> 20:51.960
I never would have met you.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.379
On the plus side,
Mrs. Lincoln.

20:54.462 --> 20:56.339
Will you be my mentor?

20:56.423 --> 20:57.632
Your mentor?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.093
In life, my mentor in life?

21:02.512 --> 21:04.556
I don't know, Stacy.
I hate you.

21:04.639 --> 21:08.059
Well, yeah,
sure, now,

21:08.143 --> 21:09.352
but in time.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.357
And frankly,
it's tough to mentor someone

21:14.441 --> 21:16.526
with such low self-esteem.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.863
Wait, you think that I have
low self-esteem?

21:19.946 --> 21:22.282
Why else would you sleep
with your professor?

21:23.491 --> 21:26.327
A lot of my friends are
sleeping with the professors.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.205
Then how do you know
what you're being graded on?

21:31.082 --> 21:32.500
You are like a genius.

21:32.584 --> 21:34.252
- You know that?
- Oh, my God.

21:34.336 --> 21:36.629
Can we do this again
sometime,

21:36.713 --> 21:38.631
continue this conversation?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.343
Why don't you give me
a few days

21:41.426 --> 21:43.428
to stop wanting
to strangle you?

21:43.511 --> 21:45.513
Fair enough.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.558
Chef Haller and his staff
now have only a few hours

21:48.641 --> 21:50.018
to complete this feast

21:50.101 --> 21:51.770
for the president
of the United States,

21:51.853 --> 21:55.357
the prime minister of Japan,
and 120 invited guests.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.317
And this is the first course,
Chef Haller.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.904
Yes, a fish stew: lobster,
scallops, shrimp, and clams.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.031
Oh, a taste of New England.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.699
- May I?
- Oh.

22:09.204 --> 22:10.497
Thank you.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.421
And that's wonderful.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.632
And this will be followed
by what, Chef?

22:20.715 --> 22:21.800
The loin of lamb.

22:21.883 --> 22:25.303
Ah, the filet mignon
of the lamb.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.722
This is one of your
specialties, I understand.

22:27.806 --> 22:29.057
The president
and the first lady

22:29.140 --> 22:30.308
are fond of this dish.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.352
Yes, well, I can see why.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.270
It's just beautiful.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.022
And you prepare this simply.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.108
Very simply.
The lamb does not need much.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.693
No, I quite agree.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.154
What a treat your guests
will be in for tonight.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.823
And cut.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.449
Ah.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.243
Well, that was perfect.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.620
And may we stay
a few minutes more

22:50.704 --> 22:52.455
to watch your team
at work, Chef?

22:52.539 --> 22:53.540
Absolutely not.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.792
And please stop
touching my knives.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.085
The stew is too salty.

22:57.168 --> 22:58.211
You didn't notice?

22:58.294 --> 22:59.421
Well--

22:59.504 --> 23:02.799
We don't want to interfere
with your preparation, Chef.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.217
Perhaps when everything
is ready,

23:04.300 --> 23:05.719
we could return
to film the moment

23:05.802 --> 23:06.720
the food leaves the kitchen.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.013
Who are you?

23:08.096 --> 23:09.889
I'm Alice Naman.
I'm the producer.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.474
You wanted to film
Chef Haller.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.727
I permitted you
to film Chef Haller.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.937
Chef Haller has allowed you
to taste his food.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.273
He has watched you
touch his knives.

23:18.356 --> 23:22.110
Chef Haller has smiled
at the camera for two days.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.820
He has put up with you
long enough.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.281
Now, go, and let
Chef Haller do his job.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.034
Yes, well, thank you,
Chef Haller,

23:29.117 --> 23:30.410
for giving us so much
of your time.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.786
Out!

23:31.870 --> 23:33.913
- Mm.
- Yeah. Yeah.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.540
All right, show me your pies.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.001
Beautiful.

23:39.294 --> 23:42.464
I made "The French Chef"
for you, you know.

23:42.547 --> 23:44.049
You did?

23:44.132 --> 23:46.134
Well, that pilot
was the first thing

23:46.217 --> 23:48.887
I ever did that you liked.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.389
I wanted to make you happy

23:51.473 --> 23:54.517
and to have something
to talk about when I got home.

23:55.518 --> 23:57.312
And then I would
cook for you,

23:57.395 --> 23:59.814
make you the things Julia made.

23:59.898 --> 24:01.483
Oh, those were
our best nights.

24:01.566 --> 24:02.567
Mm-hmm.

24:02.650 --> 24:03.735
OK.

24:03.818 --> 24:06.279
I think we're ready
for the oven.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.073
Russell, if you
and Benjamin want

24:08.156 --> 24:09.866
to start moving your equipment
into the state dining room,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.993
the guests will be arriving
in about 30 minutes.

24:12.077 --> 24:12.994
All right.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.245
A timeline
of the evening's events.

24:14.329 --> 24:15.330
Oh, yes.

24:15.413 --> 24:16.915
Tony Bennett?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.751
Oh, I love Tony Bennett.

24:19.834 --> 24:20.877
Me too.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.128
You can film
whatever you want,

24:22.212 --> 24:23.880
whatever
your director's eye sees.

24:23.963 --> 24:24.798
Oh--

24:26.508 --> 24:29.594
I'm sorry if we had upset
Chef Haller in any way.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.554
I know that he's under
tremendous pressure.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.849
Well, pressure is what
we live with every day.

24:34.933 --> 24:35.975
Pressure is the job.

24:36.059 --> 24:37.435
Oh, my.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.980
And when should we head over?

24:41.064 --> 24:42.148
Over to where?

24:42.232 --> 24:44.776
To dinner, for the dinner.

24:45.985 --> 24:48.822
You're not guests
at the dinner, Mrs. Child.

24:48.905 --> 24:49.948
Oh.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.033
No, no, I was told that--
I have a letter.

24:52.117 --> 24:53.868
I'm sorry if there was
some confusion,

24:53.952 --> 24:55.995
but you were invited
to shoot a documentary,

24:56.079 --> 24:57.872
not as dinner guests
of the president.

25:00.417 --> 25:03.086
It's part of the program
we're filming.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.881
I conclude by sampling
the food that's been prepared.

25:06.965 --> 25:08.633
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

25:08.717 --> 25:10.260
There are no seats
for you at dinner.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.348
Ugh.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.100
Are you sure you don't mind?

25:17.976 --> 25:19.436
Oh, no.

25:19.519 --> 25:22.063
I may take mine off, too,
in a moment.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.150
Oh, I know this is
limited consolation,

25:25.233 --> 25:27.318
but we're getting
some great stuff.

25:27.402 --> 25:30.655
Tony Bennett just sang
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

25:30.739 --> 25:32.490
Good choice, Mr. Bennett.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.617
Yeah.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.453
Got to go.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.996
I say we break
into the kitchen,

25:38.079 --> 25:39.622
murder Chef Haller
with his own knife,

25:39.706 --> 25:41.583
and grab whatever food we can.

25:41.666 --> 25:42.876
I feel like I'm going to faint.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.295
Better that
than the fish stew, Alice.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.547
Believe me.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.799
I figure it's been
a long day.

25:51.259 --> 25:53.011
- Oh.
- Shrimp and grits.

25:53.094 --> 25:55.805
- Oh.
- Oh, you're a saint.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.057
What's your name?

25:57.140 --> 25:58.892
I'm Zephyr Wright.

25:58.975 --> 26:01.811
Well, I don't understand.

26:01.895 --> 26:03.396
With all this going on
tonight,

26:03.480 --> 26:04.981
and you've made this
just for us?

26:05.065 --> 26:08.234
I made it for the president
and the first lady

26:08.318 --> 26:11.071
on the second floor
in the private kitchen.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.947
Mr. and Mrs. Johnson
don't really care

26:13.031 --> 26:15.283
for all the fancy food.

26:15.367 --> 26:17.911
They'll eat this after
when they go up for bed.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.080
Mmm. I can understand why.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.206
This is amazing.

26:21.289 --> 26:23.124
That's what Lady Bird says.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.250
Hmm.

26:24.334 --> 26:27.337
It's salted to perfection.

26:28.546 --> 26:31.549
So, Zephyr,
Chef Haller is the face

26:31.633 --> 26:34.636
of the White House kitchen,
but you are the genius.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.972
We should be doing
the show about you.

26:38.056 --> 26:40.558
Oh, I don't think so.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.310
I'm happy with how things are.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.357
It was a pleasure to meet you.

26:50.568 --> 26:51.903
Is she still
at the White House?

26:51.986 --> 26:53.571
Dining with the president.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.989
Tonight's the big night.

26:56.449 --> 26:57.909
Simca?

26:57.992 --> 27:00.870
I am not a vain person.

27:00.954 --> 27:01.955
Of course you're not.

27:02.038 --> 27:05.125
I am embarrassed
to feel such trouble.

27:08.378 --> 27:10.588
But how can you
possibly find your light

27:10.672 --> 27:13.091
when she's such a bright star?

27:15.385 --> 27:18.054
Well, it was hard
for me, too, for a time.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.849
I find that I've come
to terms with it.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.018
Oh, you're
a much finer person.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.854
Well, you can't make her
shine less brightly.

27:25.937 --> 27:29.607
But that light
illuminates us too.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.693
And she'll never
leave you behind.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.194
Mm, I don't know.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.904
No, I'm telling you,

27:34.988 --> 27:38.074
she loves you,
and she needs you.

27:38.158 --> 27:41.494
I don't want what she has.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.079
I don't.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.956
A television program.

27:47.542 --> 27:51.087
But I don't want her
to have it either.

27:51.171 --> 27:54.299
Those are my recipes
she's famous for.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.302
Yes, they are.

28:01.556 --> 28:03.308
I ran out of wine now.

28:03.391 --> 28:04.934
The truth is, Simca,

28:05.018 --> 28:08.730
we would not be where we are
if it weren't for her.

28:08.813 --> 28:12.192
So this is just our burden.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.445
But I'll tell you what.

28:15.528 --> 28:17.572
You and I can be
charter members

28:17.655 --> 28:20.450
of the Julia's Shadow Club.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.952
And you can call me
anytime you've lost your way

28:23.036 --> 28:26.373
and I'll buck you up
because I'm a fan.

28:26.456 --> 28:29.376
Thank you, Paul.

28:29.459 --> 28:33.546
But I'd rather see her fall
on her face once in a while.

28:33.630 --> 28:35.048
We took our name from it,

28:35.131 --> 28:37.509
a name that still
no one can pronounce.

28:39.219 --> 28:40.845
Thankfully, we didn't
take his golf game.

28:42.555 --> 28:46.768
A man of infinite erudition,
impeccable taste,

28:46.851 --> 28:49.354
peerless business acumen,

28:49.437 --> 28:53.942
our founder and still
our captain, Alfred Knopf.

29:01.408 --> 29:06.287
You know, I am a man
who prefers the written

29:06.371 --> 29:08.998
to the spoken word,
so let me say simply

29:09.082 --> 29:11.876
that I am supremely proud

29:11.960 --> 29:15.338
of what you and I
have accomplished together.

29:16.589 --> 29:18.425
I am bullish
on American letters.

29:18.508 --> 29:22.345
And I look forward
to the next 50 years at Knopf.

29:29.686 --> 29:32.480
I believe
it's time for dessert.

29:32.564 --> 29:36.651
I'd like to say a few words
if that's OK with you, Alfred.

29:36.735 --> 29:39.070
Thank you.

29:39.154 --> 29:42.741
Alfred, here's to you
and this remarkable place

29:42.824 --> 29:44.492
where we all work.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.750
We tell stories.

29:51.833 --> 29:56.838
More important, we decide
which stories get told.

29:56.921 --> 30:01.843
The ones we do not choose
are, over time, forgotten,

30:01.926 --> 30:07.057
which means we have
a very consequential job

30:07.140 --> 30:11.102
to decide what is remembered.

30:15.231 --> 30:20.737
Blanche Knopf is the cofounder
of this house.

30:20.820 --> 30:25.575
It was her influence
that brought Sigmund Freud,

30:25.658 --> 30:29.079
Albert Camus,
Simone de Beauvoir,

30:29.162 --> 30:32.665
and Thomas Mann
to this country.

30:32.749 --> 30:35.085
She championed German writers

30:35.168 --> 30:37.087
who spoke up against the Nazis.

30:37.170 --> 30:38.963
She was a champion
of women writers

30:39.047 --> 30:41.341
wherever she could find them.

30:41.424 --> 30:46.888
And no one could recognize
a unique voice

30:46.971 --> 30:50.892
or guide it better
than Blanche.

30:52.602 --> 30:55.271
She has taste and discernment

30:55.355 --> 30:58.775
that is without equal
in the world of publishing.

30:58.858 --> 31:01.027
It is no disservice
to her husband

31:01.111 --> 31:03.655
or any of the men
with whom she works

31:03.738 --> 31:06.157
that she towers above them all.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.790
And so I propose a toast.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.459
A toast!

31:22.632 --> 31:25.135
To Blanche Knopf,

31:25.218 --> 31:28.513
who has always seen
what no one else could.

31:28.596 --> 31:30.557
To Blanche Knopf.

31:34.978 --> 31:37.188
And rags to riches.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.983
- Yes.
- Well, that was an evening.

31:40.066 --> 31:40.984
Oh.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.068
The president
and the prime minister

31:42.152 --> 31:43.153
got along swimmingly.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.613
Everything went
precisely according to plan.

31:45.697 --> 31:48.116
Those are my favorite words
in the English language,

31:48.199 --> 31:49.617
"according to plan."

31:49.701 --> 31:51.828
You really know
how to throw a party.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.913
And on behalf
of the Office of Protocol,

31:53.997 --> 31:56.458
I want to thank you
for playing your part

31:56.541 --> 31:59.419
and making it possible
for us to tell our story.

31:59.502 --> 32:02.797
This is for you,
a token of our appreciation.

32:02.881 --> 32:04.507
Our guests love them.

32:04.591 --> 32:06.176
The napkins have the logo.

32:06.259 --> 32:08.720
- Oh, yes.
- Oh.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.055
You shouldn't have.

32:10.138 --> 32:12.557
If you stay a minute,
I can place you

32:12.640 --> 32:14.142
in a strategic position
where you can catch

32:14.225 --> 32:16.061
the president as he heads up
to the residence.

32:16.144 --> 32:18.855
He may even stop and chat
for a minute if you're lucky.

32:18.938 --> 32:21.483
That'd be amazing.

32:21.566 --> 32:23.026
Well, perhaps
while Russ is doing that,

32:23.109 --> 32:26.154
Julia can interview
Zephyr Wright from the kitchen.

32:26.237 --> 32:27.947
It would be wonderful
to include the perspective

32:28.031 --> 32:31.326
of an ordinary citizen
who works at the White House.

32:31.409 --> 32:32.994
Oh, pity.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.871
She's not on the list.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.289
Right.

32:36.373 --> 32:37.332
Got it.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.584
Well, we will just wait here
for you, Russ.

32:42.253 --> 32:43.672
Maybe when you're done,

32:43.755 --> 32:45.507
I can get a minute
to talk about Hollywood.

32:45.590 --> 32:46.925
Oh, but you're
at the White House.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.134
Oh, it's a dead-end job.

32:48.218 --> 32:49.719
No one stays
for the second term.

32:49.803 --> 32:52.472
Well, GBH is...

32:52.555 --> 32:54.849
Some women
just do better with men.

32:57.060 --> 32:58.645
This is pretty good.

32:58.728 --> 33:01.147
Hunter's wife, Tilly,
made it.

33:01.231 --> 33:03.900
It's a bit of a story.

33:03.983 --> 33:09.989
Men just take
and take and take and take...

33:10.073 --> 33:11.950
whatever they want.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.452
And the world says,
go right ahead.

33:14.536 --> 33:15.453
You're a man.

33:15.537 --> 33:16.538
You want it?

33:16.621 --> 33:18.623
It's yours.

33:18.707 --> 33:20.667
Yes, they're the worst, men.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.962
I hate them myself.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.423
- You didn't see this.
- Mm-mm.

33:26.506 --> 33:28.091
Don't be stingy.

33:33.430 --> 33:34.723
Thank you.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.228
I want love.

33:40.311 --> 33:41.688
Of course.

33:41.771 --> 33:44.065
But I'd prefer respect.

33:44.149 --> 33:48.278
Mm, respect is hard
to come by.

33:48.361 --> 33:50.155
Bernard wasn't like that.

33:51.948 --> 33:54.826
And you're not
like that, are you?

33:54.909 --> 33:56.828
Like most men.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.288
Why is that?

33:59.748 --> 34:02.083
I really don't know
how to answer.

34:02.167 --> 34:04.377
Well...

34:04.461 --> 34:06.880
you're not exactly
Clark Kent, Paul.

34:06.963 --> 34:09.841
But you're a man among men.

34:11.634 --> 34:14.846
Here, eat
before it gets cold.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.681
Ugh, I just need a hot bath,

34:16.764 --> 34:18.641
and my whole outlook
will shift.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.149
I just wanted
to say good night.

34:26.232 --> 34:27.192
Oh.

34:27.275 --> 34:30.820
Oh, Zephyr,
how lovely to see you again.

34:30.904 --> 34:33.572
You were
our absolute savior tonight.

34:33.656 --> 34:35.574
It's my pleasure.

34:35.658 --> 34:38.536
I'm heading to the bus stop,
Ms. Naman.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.746
Walk with me.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.458
I'll meet you
back at the hotel.

34:46.628 --> 34:48.630
Just tickles me.

34:48.713 --> 34:50.130
I'm so impressed.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.382
Ugh, oh, no.

34:51.466 --> 34:52.967
I am.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.344
How old are you?

34:54.427 --> 34:55.553
I'm 25.

34:55.637 --> 34:58.014
- My, oh, my.
- Hmm.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.891
A young Black woman
in a position

34:59.974 --> 35:04.771
of such important influence
over how people think.

35:04.854 --> 35:06.648
Thank you.

35:06.731 --> 35:09.442
It doesn't always feel
that way, though.

35:09.526 --> 35:12.404
Most of the time,
it just feels pointless.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.656
They've got a paved road,

35:14.739 --> 35:16.616
and we're always
climbing a mountain...

35:16.700 --> 35:17.742
- Hmm.
- Just to get

35:17.826 --> 35:19.786
- to the same place.
- Yes.

35:19.869 --> 35:21.538
Yes, exactly.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.373
I understand.

35:23.456 --> 35:25.583
Believe me.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.128
And yet here you are.

35:31.923 --> 35:33.800
But now,

35:33.883 --> 35:37.470
don't you be disappointed
in me, Alice.

35:37.554 --> 35:40.181
What?
I'm not. Why would you--

35:40.265 --> 35:42.267
Because I keep silent,

35:42.350 --> 35:45.103
because I'm happy
to be silent

35:45.186 --> 35:46.563
and invisible.

35:46.646 --> 35:48.523
I just wanted the world
to know you.

35:50.900 --> 35:55.071
You've found a wonderful way
to make your voice heard.

35:55.155 --> 35:57.657
So have I.

35:57.741 --> 36:01.536
You speak loudly,
and I whisper.

36:03.413 --> 36:07.125
I say nothing
in Chef Haller's kitchen.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.085
And I cook for the president

36:09.169 --> 36:11.421
and his family
and his friends.

36:11.504 --> 36:12.714
You don't have to explain.

36:12.797 --> 36:16.885
We talk,
the president and I,

36:16.968 --> 36:19.012
when no one else is there,

36:19.095 --> 36:21.848
about many things,

36:21.931 --> 36:24.517
consequential things.

36:26.353 --> 36:30.732
He gave me the pen he used
to sign the Civil Rights Act.

36:34.569 --> 36:35.820
I had no idea.

36:35.904 --> 36:38.114
Of course not.

36:38.198 --> 36:40.909
What would people say
if they knew?

36:45.997 --> 36:47.874
You make me proud, Alice.

36:50.001 --> 36:52.837
I wish I'd had the kind
of path that you had.

36:54.422 --> 36:57.258
I did what I could,

36:57.342 --> 36:59.928
and I got lucky.

37:00.011 --> 37:03.098
Food gave me a voice,

37:03.181 --> 37:06.017
just like with you and Julia.

37:06.101 --> 37:07.352
Hmm.

37:11.022 --> 37:13.149
I look forward
to seeing the program.

37:15.985 --> 37:16.986
Thank you.

37:17.070 --> 37:20.031
We'll both fight the fight...

37:20.115 --> 37:22.575
in our own ways.

37:32.419 --> 37:35.547
Sorry about the way
they treated you two.

37:35.630 --> 37:39.259
I just--I didn't know
it was my place to say.

37:39.342 --> 37:42.387
No, of course not.
And we had a job to do.

37:42.470 --> 37:43.680
The job is what counts.

37:43.763 --> 37:45.849
Respect is just gravy.

37:45.932 --> 37:48.601
And given the heaviness
of Chef Haller's gravy,

37:48.685 --> 37:52.439
perhaps a thing best forgotten
at this White House.

37:52.522 --> 37:54.149
OK.

37:54.232 --> 37:55.316
Thank you.

37:58.653 --> 38:00.697
It's getting late.

38:00.780 --> 38:04.284
I will take the first leg
of the drive in the morning.

38:05.535 --> 38:07.996
- Good night.
- Good night, Russ.

38:08.079 --> 38:09.873
Yes, good night, Russ.

38:17.047 --> 38:19.674
The world isn't very kind
to women, is it?

38:21.760 --> 38:24.095
No.

38:24.179 --> 38:26.473
Most of us can't do
anything about it.

38:27.932 --> 38:30.018
But you have a spotlight.

38:32.562 --> 38:33.813
Yes, I do.

38:36.399 --> 38:38.443
It's too late
for "by women, for women."

38:38.526 --> 38:40.904
But it is not too late.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.162
Thank you, Alice.

38:51.164 --> 38:52.165
When will we see
the galleys

38:52.248 --> 38:54.209
for "Keepers of the House,"
Albert?

38:54.292 --> 38:56.544
Next week,
week after, the latest.

38:56.628 --> 38:57.796
Very good.

38:57.879 --> 39:01.132
Well, thank you all
for last night.

39:01.216 --> 39:02.967
That was splendid.

39:03.051 --> 39:04.928
Well, nothing more for me.

39:10.725 --> 39:13.436
I'd like to say a few words.

39:32.872 --> 39:34.207
I'm going blind.

39:35.208 --> 39:38.336
That's not exactly news,
but there it is.

39:39.421 --> 39:44.342
For the past year, all my work
has actually been done

39:44.426 --> 39:45.719
- by Judith.
- Blanche, that's--

39:45.802 --> 39:47.220
No.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.766
She has covered for me

39:51.850 --> 39:56.146
so I could pretend
to do this job that I love.

40:01.276 --> 40:04.404
It is the only thing I love...

40:06.364 --> 40:08.199
Except for Judith.

40:12.871 --> 40:14.706
Thank you

40:14.789 --> 40:16.666
for acknowledging last night

40:16.750 --> 40:19.544
my part
in building this house.

40:19.627 --> 40:23.548
But firms and office buildings,
that's Ozymandias stuff.

40:23.631 --> 40:26.134
What will last

40:26.217 --> 40:28.094
is the books.

40:32.098 --> 40:36.644
And I have put
a piece of myself

40:36.728 --> 40:38.730
in each of them.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.151
Invisible...

40:45.403 --> 40:47.364
But not silent.

40:51.326 --> 40:54.913
And that's enough for me.

41:01.544 --> 41:05.924
I want to hear everything,
every detail.

41:06.007 --> 41:08.802
Well, it'll be
a remarkable program, I think,

41:08.885 --> 41:13.348
but the whole visit
had the strangest effect on me.

41:13.431 --> 41:14.349
Hmm.

41:14.432 --> 41:17.018
At first, I was...
disappointed.

41:17.102 --> 41:18.019
Wh--

41:18.103 --> 41:19.771
Oh, apparently,
at the White House,

41:19.854 --> 41:21.940
I am very small potatoes.

41:22.023 --> 41:23.316
Well, that can't be true.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.567
They invited you.

41:24.651 --> 41:26.444
No, it is.
And it doesn't matter.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.279
As you always used to say,
in the diplomatic corps,

41:28.363 --> 41:30.615
we are smaller
than our purpose.

41:30.699 --> 41:32.450
In the end,
it was invigorating.

41:32.534 --> 41:35.787
Well, that is very vague
but splendid news.

41:35.870 --> 41:37.330
Mm.

41:38.540 --> 41:39.624
What about you, Paul?

41:39.708 --> 41:40.875
Did you get along?

41:40.959 --> 41:41.960
I did.

41:42.043 --> 41:46.047
I accomplished
a lot of small things that...

41:46.131 --> 41:48.800
seemed to be
very much appreciated.

41:49.634 --> 41:52.387
Felt good to be
Paul Child this week.

41:52.470 --> 41:53.555
I should think so.

41:53.638 --> 41:55.015
It's a wonderful thing to be.

41:55.098 --> 41:57.600
I spent time
with Hunter and his wife,

41:57.684 --> 41:59.436
with Avis, with Simca.

41:59.519 --> 42:01.771
Gosh, you social butterfly.

42:01.855 --> 42:02.939
Mm.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.983
And then
here's a nice topper.

42:05.066 --> 42:08.069
We got a call
from an old friend.

42:08.153 --> 42:09.446
Really? Who?

42:09.529 --> 42:14.451
Do you remember Frank Bludger
from our old OSS days?

42:14.534 --> 42:17.996
Apparently, he's in town
for his niece's wedding,

42:18.079 --> 42:19.372
and he wants to see us.

42:19.456 --> 42:22.208
He already knew that you'd been
at the White House.

42:22.292 --> 42:24.753
He told me
you're a true patriot,

42:24.836 --> 42:26.629
and I agreed.

42:26.713 --> 42:31.384
Turns out, he's in the FBI,
which...

42:31.468 --> 42:33.386
fits for Frank,
don't you think?

42:39.309 --> 42:40.435
Jul?

42:42.187 --> 42:44.439
He's not here
for his niece's wedding.

42:44.522 --> 42:46.191
My,

42:46.274 --> 42:48.526
you do have your finger
on the pulse of things,

42:48.610 --> 42:49.569
don't you?

42:49.652 --> 42:51.571
Yes, he's here to see me.

42:53.490 --> 42:55.658
He's been following me
for months.

42:59.412 --> 43:05.710
The FBI wants information
about radical behavior at WGBH.

43:05.794 --> 43:07.629
At GBH?

43:07.712 --> 43:10.465
I would have thought
you'd tell him to go to hell.

43:12.300 --> 43:13.843
For months?

43:15.637 --> 43:17.931
Why didn't you
say something, Jul?

43:23.478 --> 43:25.146
He blackmailed me.

43:28.775 --> 43:30.777
He said
that if I didn't help...

43:32.737 --> 43:35.824
He would make public
the accusations

43:35.907 --> 43:39.494
made against you
when you retired...

43:39.577 --> 43:42.664
the communism,

43:42.747 --> 43:44.874
the homosexuality.

44:17.449 --> 44:20.035
I'm sorry you've been
afraid all this time.

44:22.203 --> 44:24.122
Well, I don't want to be.

44:24.205 --> 44:27.792
I want to take them all on,

44:27.876 --> 44:30.128
all these men.

44:30.211 --> 44:31.713
Who are they, anyway?

44:31.796 --> 44:33.256
Julia...

44:35.508 --> 44:37.093
I'm not afraid.

44:38.470 --> 44:40.972
Let them say what they want.

44:41.056 --> 44:45.143
They have no power over me.

44:45.226 --> 44:48.188
I am a contented man.

44:50.774 --> 44:52.359
I love you so much.

44:53.943 --> 44:55.236
I married the right guy.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.488
Yes, you did.

45:00.742 --> 45:04.037
Frank may not have
considered this, but...

45:05.997 --> 45:08.083
We still have a few tricks
up our sleeves

45:08.166 --> 45:10.585
from our old OSS days.

45:12.879 --> 45:16.508
Shall we beat them
at their own game,

45:16.591 --> 45:19.302
you and I, yes?

45:21.930 --> 45:23.348
Yes.

45:25.392 --> 45:27.185
Oh, yes.

45:29.813 --> 45:31.815
Let the games begin.
