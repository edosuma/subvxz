WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.401
I am a registered Republican.

00:03.929 --> 00:07.048
I'm gonna get a great job, and
I will pay you back every penny.

00:07.073 --> 00:10.059
- Now that's a power suit.
- I haven't gotten the job yet.

00:10.084 --> 00:12.613
I really don't want anybody
to know about Jacob

00:12.638 --> 00:13.938
or that I was in the hospital.

00:13.963 --> 00:16.090
You do need someone to talk to.

00:16.114 --> 00:17.181
I have you.

00:17.206 --> 00:18.472
You remember my mother?

00:18.497 --> 00:20.550
Will you stay and have
one last drink with me?

00:20.575 --> 00:22.255
- Sure. Why not?
- Morning.

00:22.559 --> 00:24.039
Wake up.

00:24.947 --> 00:26.322
Up.

00:26.347 --> 00:29.190
But what about this
photo of you and Mariana?

00:29.215 --> 00:30.832
Can I have everyone's attention?

00:30.857 --> 00:34.077
I am not seeing Evan. I'm seeing Raj.

00:36.159 --> 00:38.935
I'm so excited for this cruise, Patty.

00:39.450 --> 00:40.723
Me, too, Debbie.

00:40.748 --> 00:43.816
I can't wait for the
all-you-can-eat buffets.

00:43.841 --> 00:45.968
Right? Here, Patty.

00:45.993 --> 00:47.804
Let me help you unpack your bags.

00:51.339 --> 00:53.681
Is this a new outfit?

00:53.706 --> 00:56.981
Yes. For dinner at the captain's table.

00:57.006 --> 00:59.836
- Fancy.
- Well, should you be shopping

00:59.861 --> 01:01.249
when money is tight?

01:01.930 --> 01:03.029
Yes, and...

01:04.058 --> 01:06.599
Yes, and I got it on sale.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.168
- Oh. On sale? For $1,595.
- _

01:18.229 --> 01:19.745
Well, Debbie,

01:20.135 --> 01:23.671
I bought it when I thought
I was gonna get a new job.

01:23.696 --> 01:26.406
Yes, and maybe if you
studied a little harder

01:26.431 --> 01:28.425
and spent a little
less time on the roof,

01:28.450 --> 01:31.510
you would have passed
the bar... tending exam,

01:31.535 --> 01:35.093
and I wouldn't be here
paying for our vacation.

01:35.634 --> 01:38.670
Yes, and it's great that
you don't resent it at all.

01:38.695 --> 01:40.757
You don't have to pay
me back. We're family.

01:40.782 --> 01:42.965
Since, you know, we're family.

01:42.990 --> 01:47.034
Well, it's the least I could do
after you up and quit your job.

01:47.369 --> 01:50.869
Speaking of jobs, have you had any
more sex dreams about your boss?

02:17.217 --> 02:18.241
Dear friend,

02:18.750 --> 02:21.284
you are invited to a low-key

02:21.309 --> 02:25.853
party at The Coterie to
celebrate my 25th year of life

02:25.878 --> 02:27.879
on this planet.

02:27.904 --> 02:30.155
We've all been so busy with our lives,

02:30.180 --> 02:32.506
- following our own story lines.
- _

02:34.912 --> 02:37.754
We haven't had our usual
family dinners or salons.

02:39.476 --> 02:42.344
So as your present to me,

02:42.369 --> 02:45.945
I'd love you to share your
talents with all of us.

02:47.464 --> 02:50.558
Please turn this card
over and take this...

02:51.124 --> 02:55.419
inspiration to prepare some
sort of creative expression.

02:56.106 --> 02:59.357
_

03:02.126 --> 03:05.644
_

03:07.269 --> 03:10.269
_

03:10.294 --> 03:12.144
Sister Act?

03:13.801 --> 03:15.541
We could dress up as nuns and sing.

03:17.034 --> 03:19.393
The idea is to express yourself,

03:19.418 --> 03:22.444
because that is what sets us free.

03:23.081 --> 03:26.525
Ugh. I thought my birthday
parties were obnoxious.

03:26.550 --> 03:27.550
So you admit that?

03:29.272 --> 03:31.617
"Breathe"? What is
that supposed to mean?

03:31.642 --> 03:33.191
I don't know. Maybe chill?

03:33.556 --> 03:35.090
I'm chill.

03:35.327 --> 03:37.353
Well, apparently, I'm not surprising.

03:37.378 --> 03:40.112
You know, I once bought
oat milk on a whim.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.574
Remember that? You know, I don't
even know how milk comes from an oak,

03:42.598 --> 03:44.778
but I thought, eh, maybe
I'll surprise everyone!

03:44.803 --> 03:46.669
No offense, but you couldn't
even surprise your parents

03:46.693 --> 03:48.592
- when you came out.
- Fair.

03:48.617 --> 03:51.869
Oh, Mariana, what's the most
surprising thing you've ever done?

03:52.053 --> 03:54.929
Um, I guess my threesome.

03:55.370 --> 03:58.110
Okay, swinger. Maybe
I'll ask someone normal.

04:00.663 --> 04:03.372
Oh, I've done a lot
of surprising things.

04:03.397 --> 04:07.207
Seriously? 'Cause you
seem pretty consistent.

04:07.742 --> 04:09.357
Oh, you don't know the old Callie.

04:09.382 --> 04:12.143
- She once got in a car with a pimp.
- Mariana!

04:13.115 --> 04:14.315
Who are you people?

04:14.695 --> 04:17.372
- So what's your card say?
- Sister Act.

04:17.397 --> 04:19.557
Hmm. I can see that. I mean,

04:19.582 --> 04:21.618
you two have been sort
of out of sync, lately.

04:21.642 --> 04:23.094
No, we haven't.

04:23.119 --> 04:25.939
See? Perfectly in sync.

04:26.148 --> 04:28.787
'N Sync! We could sing "Bye Bye Bye".

04:28.812 --> 04:32.194
You know, it is kind of a
lot of pressure to put on us

04:32.219 --> 04:34.736
to prepare some sort of performance.

04:34.761 --> 04:37.541
- Even if it is your birthday.
- Hey!

04:39.277 --> 04:40.552
Hey. What's going on?

04:40.577 --> 04:42.294
Just talking about how excited we are

04:42.319 --> 04:43.869
for your birthday party!

04:43.894 --> 04:45.312
Yes. Can't wait.

04:45.337 --> 04:47.837
Yeah, I think it's gonna be really fun.

04:47.862 --> 04:50.022
Which is what we were all saying.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.728
- Wow. Look at the time.
- Yeah, I have laundry.

04:53.753 --> 04:56.713
I gotta get to work. Love you.

04:57.504 --> 04:59.588
Hey, thanks for not
inviting me to your birthday.

04:59.613 --> 05:01.415
Sorry. Just trying to keep it small.

05:01.438 --> 05:03.096
Oh, I'm not being sarcastic.

05:03.098 --> 05:06.241
I'm seriously glad that you
didn't invite me. Thank you.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.226
Actually, we need someone
to run lights and music.

05:09.788 --> 05:11.028
What's in it for me?

05:11.948 --> 05:14.149
But it's your 25!

05:14.174 --> 05:15.968
You know, so we gots to celebrate.

05:15.993 --> 05:18.261
Yeah, I'm just not feeling
everybody getting turnt.

05:18.286 --> 05:20.726
I just want to kick back
where we can reconnect.

05:21.101 --> 05:23.267
Malika, is that your brother?

05:25.302 --> 05:26.734
Yeah. I got him a job here.

05:27.084 --> 05:28.951
Girl, what the hell?
He tryin' to be Sisqo?

05:28.976 --> 05:30.970
- What's going on with...
- He is finding himself.

05:30.995 --> 05:33.054
- Okay.
- How is it with you two?

05:33.079 --> 05:36.230
- You know. Ebbs and flows.
- Is he coming to your party?

05:36.255 --> 05:38.313
I don't know.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.100
Hey, Dom. You coming to my birthday?

05:40.125 --> 05:42.909
Depends. Any surprise
guests I need to worry about?

05:42.934 --> 05:45.179
Oh, just you. If you show.

05:45.199 --> 05:48.233
- All right. I guess I'll be there.
- All right.

05:48.258 --> 05:49.583
Hey, ladies.

05:49.608 --> 05:50.749
- How you doing?
- How are you?

05:50.773 --> 05:52.013
I'm all right.

05:53.384 --> 05:56.424
I better get back to it before this
one starts clapping orders at me.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.500
And we're flowing.

06:03.418 --> 06:05.893
Did you tell Malika about Jacob?

06:05.918 --> 06:07.371
Or that I was in the hospital?

06:08.255 --> 06:09.821
No. I would never tell anyone. Why?

06:19.048 --> 06:23.125
Well, maybe it's because you've
been hiding in your loft for weeks,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.070
and people want to know
what's going on with you.

06:26.892 --> 06:28.772
- So are you coming?
- No.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.140
You should. You know, people miss you.

06:33.165 --> 06:35.005
You've gotta get back
into the world, you know.

06:35.030 --> 06:36.887
You're not going to your group therapy

06:36.912 --> 06:39.038
and you're not working on your music.

06:39.063 --> 06:41.143
All you're doing is whatever that is.

06:42.287 --> 06:44.027
All right. Next verse.

06:46.043 --> 06:49.420
Okay. "Hey, Malika, don't you seethe,

06:49.445 --> 06:52.705
when someone swipes your cold
brew, you just gotta breathe."

06:54.786 --> 06:56.285
Come on. I need a catchy hook.

06:56.488 --> 06:58.454
How about this?

07:03.664 --> 07:06.715
♪ I don't know you ♪

07:06.740 --> 07:10.042
♪ But I want you ♪

07:10.067 --> 07:13.617
- ♪ All... ♪
- ♪ All the more for that ♪

07:16.509 --> 07:19.268
♪ Words fall through me ♪

07:19.293 --> 07:21.851
Okay, we're not singing that, dude.

07:21.876 --> 07:22.996
"Dude"?

07:24.046 --> 07:27.096
Okay, Dennis. Next verse. Um...

07:27.404 --> 07:29.249
"Hey, Alice, you've gotta just breathe.

07:29.274 --> 07:32.033
When we run out of paper,
we can wipe with leaves."

07:32.239 --> 07:33.239
Ah?

07:37.038 --> 07:38.958
Um...

07:42.608 --> 07:44.335
I need... I need to tell you something.

07:44.359 --> 07:48.429
Yeah, my song sucks. I know.
It's kind of the point.

07:48.454 --> 07:50.094
I had sex with your mom.

07:58.524 --> 08:00.624
What?

08:01.610 --> 08:03.269
Um...

08:03.294 --> 08:05.774
Why do you hide behind this mop?

08:10.518 --> 08:14.261
- That's better.
- You just want to be on top.

08:14.286 --> 08:17.646
I just want to see you. Maybe
it's time for a new look.

08:28.312 --> 08:31.697
Um, hey. So, uh...

08:31.722 --> 08:34.448
I'm... wearing a binder.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.210
You are?

08:38.414 --> 08:40.438
- Can I see it?
- Yeah.

08:45.376 --> 08:46.542
Does it hurt?

08:47.089 --> 08:48.714
Only if I wear it too long.

08:48.739 --> 08:50.480
So what does this mean?

08:50.968 --> 08:53.077
It means I'm not
comfortable with my chest,

08:53.102 --> 08:55.322
and this helps me feel more confident.

08:57.213 --> 09:00.231
Oh. Did it make you feel uncomfortable

09:00.256 --> 09:03.136
- when I touched them before?
- No, it's okay. You didn't know.

09:05.163 --> 09:07.643
- So, do you want to keep it on?
- Yeah.

09:08.503 --> 09:09.903
If that's okay?

09:11.004 --> 09:12.244
Sure.

09:13.031 --> 09:14.991
It actually makes me feel really sexy.

09:25.494 --> 09:29.054
What makes you feel sexy?

09:29.235 --> 09:32.313
Probably not saying
the word "sexy" so much.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.338
Seriously.

09:34.036 --> 09:36.928
- I've never really felt sexy.
- I think you are.

09:38.280 --> 09:39.680
I think you're hot.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.254
Oh, yeah? How hot is this? Huh?

09:43.768 --> 09:45.927
Do you like that? Do you like that?

09:46.408 --> 09:48.968
Hmm? Huh? Oh!

09:49.678 --> 09:51.856
My neck.

09:52.162 --> 09:54.195
Sexy hurts.

09:54.654 --> 09:57.714
- What? What's wrong?
- I feel like you're making fun of me.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.997
I'm making fun of myself.

10:02.759 --> 10:04.892
Look, I'm sorry that I'm
not comfortable being sexy,

10:04.917 --> 10:07.468
and that I'm so unsurprising.

10:07.824 --> 10:09.924
- Where are you going?
- To get some water.

10:15.026 --> 10:18.186
So, this is the first piece
of a series I'm gonna do

10:18.211 --> 10:20.920
based on the piece that
I sold in the group show.

10:21.274 --> 10:23.616
Looks like that review
got you inspired again.

10:24.932 --> 10:27.984
- Did you post it to Instagram?
- No, I don't like bragging.

10:28.009 --> 10:30.426
Hey, bragging's how you build you brand.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.544
Get people to follow you.

10:32.569 --> 10:34.867
Besides, if you don't want
to be at the mercy of critics

10:34.892 --> 10:35.893
to make or break you...

10:35.918 --> 10:38.838
I'm not gonna post naked pictures
of myself just to get attention.

10:38.863 --> 10:41.139
That's not what I'm saying.

10:41.164 --> 10:43.331
You just need to let
people know who you are.

10:43.356 --> 10:44.413
Show 'em your personality.

10:44.438 --> 10:46.530
And none of this brooding artist shit.

10:46.555 --> 10:49.405
You need to create moments, and stories.

10:49.430 --> 10:51.067
Oh, now I gotta be entertaining.

10:51.092 --> 10:53.067
Yeah. You gotta get
people interested in you,

10:53.092 --> 10:54.812
so that they can get
interested in your art.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.138
You need to...

10:59.094 --> 11:01.744
- Lighten up?
- Doesn't hurt.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.651
Well, it's not me.

11:06.615 --> 11:09.675
Sorry I'm a brooding artist,
but I can't be someone I'm not.

11:13.972 --> 11:16.572
So you were just helping
Evan with his dating profile.

11:16.597 --> 11:19.639
Yes. That's why he asked
me to have drinks with him.

11:19.883 --> 11:22.943
He said that I'm socially
well-adjusted for an engineer.

11:22.968 --> 11:24.509
He's got a point.

11:25.848 --> 11:29.533
He asked me not to tell anyone,
but I should have told you.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.299
Well, I understand why you didn't.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.725
Everybody's suspicious
of his interest in you.

11:35.774 --> 11:37.006
I'm really sorry.

11:37.031 --> 11:38.122
Me, too.

11:42.273 --> 11:44.681
Oop. Sorry.

11:45.526 --> 11:48.263
Hey. Thought you... you
were over at Jamie's tonight.

11:48.288 --> 11:51.175
- No. I have to study for the bar.
- Um, it's okay.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.911
My roommates are having poker night,

11:52.936 --> 11:55.716
and I should probably be there to
make sure no one pees in the plants.

11:55.741 --> 11:58.601
- That's a thing?
- Unfortunately.

11:58.975 --> 12:01.095
- Maybe tomorrow?
- Okay.

12:07.790 --> 12:08.790
All forgiven?

12:09.593 --> 12:11.113
- Yeah.
- Good.

12:13.236 --> 12:17.815
So, you haven't spent any
nights at Jamie's this week.

12:18.184 --> 12:19.184
Everything okay?

12:24.431 --> 12:27.523
Not here to distract you.
Just brought you some dinner.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.080
That's sweet.

12:30.113 --> 12:32.680
So, what are you doing down here?

12:32.705 --> 12:35.896
Um, it's the only
semi-quiet place to study.

12:38.612 --> 12:40.612
You know where it's really quiet?

12:41.576 --> 12:42.892
My place.

12:42.917 --> 12:44.619
Oh, yeah. Well, it might be quiet,

12:44.644 --> 12:46.570
but you are a major distraction.

12:49.707 --> 12:51.441
Seems like you've

12:51.466 --> 12:53.346
pulled away since I told
you I'm a Republican.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.101
Are we okay?

12:57.606 --> 13:00.773
Yeah. I just... like
being in my own space.

13:01.668 --> 13:03.760
Well, me, too, but...

13:04.440 --> 13:07.650
you know, if Raj lived alone
in a penthouse apartment,

13:07.675 --> 13:09.188
I'd be happy to go to his place

13:09.213 --> 13:11.041
so you could spend time
with your boyfriend.

13:11.231 --> 13:12.625
Well, I'm happy to step out.

13:13.039 --> 13:14.892
Let you guys have some time alone.

13:14.917 --> 13:16.367
Like you did just now.

13:16.392 --> 13:18.152
Like I've done many times before.

13:18.735 --> 13:21.438
Okay, well, I feel bad
kicking you out of our loft

13:21.463 --> 13:23.755
so I can have sex with
my boyfriend, so...

13:23.780 --> 13:26.364
I think maybe we could make a deal that,

13:26.389 --> 13:28.806
I don't know, you stay at
Jamie's, like, three nights a week.

13:29.587 --> 13:31.971
You know, especially 'cause
I am paying most of the rent.

13:31.996 --> 13:35.640
- I told you I'd pay you back.
- I know. It's fine. It's fine.

13:35.665 --> 13:38.441
We're family. I don't mind.

13:38.621 --> 13:40.848
So, can you spend
tomorrow night with Jamie?

13:40.873 --> 13:42.608
Sure.

13:42.633 --> 13:45.636
Would you mind not leaving your
shoes in the middle of the floor?

13:45.637 --> 13:46.678
Sure.

13:47.656 --> 13:49.659
May be you could fold and
put away your laundry

13:49.684 --> 13:51.760
instead of dumping it on the couch?

13:51.785 --> 13:53.310
I think I can do that.

13:54.137 --> 13:56.237
Do you think maybe you
can come up with something

13:56.239 --> 13:57.633
for us to do for Malika's party

13:57.657 --> 13:59.938
since you keep shooting
down all of my suggestions?

13:59.963 --> 14:03.140
Maybe we could do a scene from
"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"

14:03.165 --> 14:05.365
- What's that?
- It's an old movie.

14:07.789 --> 14:09.289
_

14:11.147 --> 14:13.905
A former child star torments
her paraplegic sister

14:13.930 --> 14:15.882
in their decaying Hollywood mansion.

14:16.167 --> 14:17.250
You can play Jane.

14:18.682 --> 14:20.182
_

14:20.856 --> 14:21.856
Very funny.

14:27.530 --> 14:30.104
Okay, well, I'm just waiting for
Stacey Abrams to get in the race.

14:30.106 --> 14:32.486
What about our girl Kamala?

14:32.854 --> 14:34.164
So, have you lived here a while?

14:34.189 --> 14:36.899
Yeah, um, I work in
the theater downstairs.

14:36.924 --> 14:39.219
You like this whole communal living?

14:39.244 --> 14:41.765
Not really, but I'm not really
into that Jonestown shit, you know?

14:41.789 --> 14:42.789
What does that mean?

14:44.045 --> 14:45.345
You know. Jim Jones?

14:46.231 --> 14:49.271
Killed all of his cult members
when they drank the poisonous punch?

14:50.556 --> 14:53.675
- Do you want more wine?
- Nah. I'm good.

14:53.700 --> 14:54.970
Well, Elizabeth Warren's

14:54.994 --> 14:56.414
got the most progressive platform.

14:56.439 --> 14:57.930
Um, Bernie.

14:57.955 --> 15:00.643
But, do you think the
country's ready for socialism?

15:00.668 --> 15:02.384
What I don't understand is...

15:02.628 --> 15:04.202
how you could have so many...

15:04.227 --> 15:07.753
progressive points of view but
still call yourself Republican.

15:07.778 --> 15:09.810
Don't say you're a fiscal conservative,

15:09.835 --> 15:12.853
because deficits have grown the
most under Republican presidents.

15:12.878 --> 15:14.718
Let's remember, the Republican party

15:14.743 --> 15:16.009
was formed to abolish slavery.

15:16.523 --> 15:19.032
Okay, look, there's no
question under this President,

15:19.057 --> 15:20.510
the Party is not what
it was meant to be.

15:20.534 --> 15:23.194
- Which is?
- About individual freedom and accountability,

15:23.219 --> 15:25.920
to protect local power, not
a big centralized government

15:25.945 --> 15:27.214
telling people how to live.

15:27.430 --> 15:28.974
The reliance on private spending,

15:28.998 --> 15:31.040
which is more efficient
than public spending.

15:31.065 --> 15:33.748
And to extend democracy,
at home and abroad.

15:33.773 --> 15:35.018
Sounds like you had that rehearsed.

15:35.042 --> 15:37.242
Well, I thought the
subject might come up.

15:37.586 --> 15:39.511
Do you think the Party's only changed

15:39.900 --> 15:41.520
under the current President?

15:42.060 --> 15:45.244
Even it is has, it is
ethical to stay in a Party

15:45.269 --> 15:46.761
for what it was meant to be,

15:46.786 --> 15:49.526
rather than the hateful
party it's become?

15:51.129 --> 15:52.749
So guilty by association.

15:54.940 --> 15:56.632
You think I'm unethical.

15:56.657 --> 15:58.867
Well, none of the Democratic
candidates are proposing

15:58.892 --> 16:01.461
that the government take
control of industry and capital.

16:01.486 --> 16:03.686
Which is the definition of socialism.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.035
It's just... Republican
party propaganda.

16:07.060 --> 16:09.863
I mean, what they want is to
reduce economic inequality.

16:09.888 --> 16:12.748
I think that the country
is ready for living wage,

16:12.773 --> 16:14.798
free college, and healthcare for all.

16:14.823 --> 16:16.476
I feel that.

16:16.501 --> 16:20.077
I'm... I'm sorry. Is this a
political debate or a birthday party?

16:20.102 --> 16:21.938
- Hear, hear.
- Welcome to The Coterie.

16:23.546 --> 16:24.957
See, it's your first time.

16:24.982 --> 16:26.915
Where's Dennis?

16:26.940 --> 16:29.008
I'm sure Dennis wanted to be here.

16:29.033 --> 16:31.552
He's just been really busy,
you know, with his music.

16:39.344 --> 16:42.921
Okay, so before we all get too lit...

16:42.946 --> 16:44.048
Hey!

16:44.073 --> 16:45.833
I wanted to say a few words.

16:46.219 --> 16:50.545
I wanted to use my
birthday to thank you all.

16:52.198 --> 16:55.950
When Alice brought me into
The Coterie, she literally

16:55.952 --> 16:59.436
carved out a piece of her loft
to give me a roof over my head.

17:00.697 --> 17:03.907
But she and all of you

17:03.932 --> 17:05.765
gave me so much more than that.

17:06.002 --> 17:07.742
You gave me my first real home.

17:09.856 --> 17:11.156
My chosen family.

17:14.981 --> 17:18.001
Without you all, I wouldn't be
graduating from college soon.

17:18.026 --> 17:21.803
- Go, sis!
- All right, all right. Malika's smart.

17:21.828 --> 17:24.454
She's smart.

17:24.479 --> 17:27.238
And I never would have met this...

17:27.262 --> 17:29.205
wonderful...

17:29.465 --> 17:30.856
beautiful man.

17:30.881 --> 17:32.384
Hey, now! Hey, now!

17:32.409 --> 17:36.653
Or have been able to share my handsome,

17:36.678 --> 17:38.988
sweet, dope-ass brother Dom

17:39.013 --> 17:40.966
with all of you.

17:40.991 --> 17:43.315
I'm blessed, and I'm so grateful.

17:43.716 --> 17:44.968
Thank you all for being here.

17:44.992 --> 17:48.486
And, I can't wait to see
what y'all cooked up for us.

17:48.511 --> 17:52.413
- Well, as long as expectations are low.
- Really low.

17:56.852 --> 17:59.363
- Whoa. What are you doing now, baby?
- Woo! She ready!

17:59.388 --> 18:00.721
Work it!

18:00.746 --> 18:04.090
Okay, so just so no one has to
feel the pressure of going first,

18:04.115 --> 18:06.497
- me and my girls got you.
- Oh, yeah!

18:15.423 --> 18:17.507
Growing up as a kid,

18:17.532 --> 18:19.824
I hated my dark skin.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.732
And if I could be transparent,

18:23.575 --> 18:25.584
even now as a grown woman,

18:25.609 --> 18:29.307
I have to constantly
reprogram my thinking.

18:29.332 --> 18:32.701
Years of being told I was
not the standard for beauty,

18:32.726 --> 18:35.060
but, see, that was a lie.

18:35.733 --> 18:40.193
Which is why I chose to
rewrite my own narrative.

18:40.217 --> 18:42.217
"Dear Black Girl,

18:42.242 --> 18:44.793
we are warriors

18:44.818 --> 18:47.094
whose spirits can't be crushed.

18:47.119 --> 18:49.052
We speak up when told we're too much.

18:49.077 --> 18:52.151
We forgive when our black men dismiss

18:52.176 --> 18:54.552
degrade and can't see that we are not

18:54.577 --> 18:57.453
the ugly ducklings, but

18:57.478 --> 19:00.137
the swan princess the Nubian goddess,

19:00.162 --> 19:01.597
the reflection of our ancestors

19:01.622 --> 19:03.133
the made in His image.

19:03.158 --> 19:07.322
When society tries to
pin light versus dark skin

19:07.347 --> 19:11.034
we remind them that
every shade of chocolate

19:11.059 --> 19:12.559
is divinely crafted."

19:12.584 --> 19:15.343
Black Girl Magic is more than a hashtag.

19:15.368 --> 19:18.236
Yes!

19:18.512 --> 19:20.120
"It is a movement.

19:20.145 --> 19:21.879
A statement like Maxine Waters

19:21.904 --> 19:24.329
claiming our power. Moving...

19:24.354 --> 19:27.514
through this world unapologetically.

19:27.539 --> 19:30.916
Degree holding with our heads held high.

19:30.941 --> 19:33.635
Melanin moisturize,
big hips, thick thighs,

19:33.660 --> 19:35.568
hair free and natural or wrapped

19:35.593 --> 19:36.724
in a protective style.

19:36.749 --> 19:39.475
Dear Black Girl, you better recognize

19:39.500 --> 19:41.396
We are the trailblazers.

19:41.421 --> 19:42.978
Everybody..."

19:42.980 --> 19:44.540
- Yes!
- "... wants to be us."

19:44.583 --> 19:47.543
Come on, preach! Come on!

19:53.136 --> 19:54.402
Whoo!

19:54.427 --> 19:56.219
"So to all my sistas

19:56.244 --> 19:58.695
as we continue this process

19:58.720 --> 20:01.032
of loving our skin

20:01.057 --> 20:04.283
start with this. Look
at yourself in the mirror.

20:06.054 --> 20:09.297
This is me.

20:09.322 --> 20:12.399
The chocolate beauty
deserving and saying,

20:12.424 --> 20:16.526
I am Queen. Dear Black Girl know...

20:20.316 --> 20:21.825
that you...

20:22.741 --> 20:24.999
You are everything."

20:39.529 --> 20:42.571
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You're here. That's what matters.

20:42.915 --> 20:44.182
What's this?

20:45.255 --> 20:47.175
Just sick of looking at the drywall.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
I miss you.

20:52.802 --> 20:56.471
I don't want to pry into
whatever's going on, but...

20:57.105 --> 21:00.198
it would mean a lot if you
came to my party tonight.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.212
We saved you a seat. Right there.

21:16.522 --> 21:19.082
Well, I think I speak for
everyone when I say, Dennis,

21:19.827 --> 21:21.589
- it's damned good to see you, man.
- Woo!

21:21.613 --> 21:23.162
Yes!

21:23.187 --> 21:24.663
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

21:24.688 --> 21:26.408
Hey, I'm gonna go get
a sweater. I'm cold.

21:46.164 --> 21:49.331
- Is that new?
- Yeah. I went shopping.

21:49.356 --> 21:50.690
You can afford to buy
clothes when you're

21:50.714 --> 21:52.116
having to pay more of the rent?

21:53.135 --> 21:54.585
Yes, Callie.

21:54.610 --> 21:56.920
We all know how responsible
you are with your money, but..

21:56.945 --> 21:58.916
I've been working hard, and
this is how I treat myself.

21:58.940 --> 22:00.980
Yeah, it's also how you
got yourself into debt.

22:04.743 --> 22:07.811
- That's not true. That is not true.
- It does. Well...

22:07.836 --> 22:09.676
- Especially in the country.
- Wow.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.521
Yes.

22:14.131 --> 22:16.085
So why'd you all choose communal living?

22:16.110 --> 22:18.990
- Oh, I...
- Well, Mariana chose for us.

22:19.811 --> 22:22.371
Because Callie left it all up to
me and she couldn't afford much.

22:23.466 --> 22:25.260
And 'cause she had a
massive crush on Gael

22:25.285 --> 22:27.525
and was planning on making
him her new boyfriend.

22:28.756 --> 22:29.905
Until you beat me to it.

22:34.461 --> 22:36.962
Well, uh, somebody's
gotta go second, right?

22:36.987 --> 22:38.330
Oh, yes.

22:38.355 --> 22:41.355
Not an easy act to follow,
but I will do my best.

22:41.841 --> 22:44.383
- Very true.
- Yes!

22:44.408 --> 22:46.803
- It's a very tough act to follow.
- Um...

22:46.828 --> 22:50.538
So, my inspiration was "Lighten Up".

22:50.563 --> 22:52.546
- Huh.
- Uh, so I wrote a little something

22:52.571 --> 22:54.871
about the important role
that light plays in art.

22:55.823 --> 22:57.123
Oh, no,

22:59.192 --> 23:00.883
Well, first...

23:00.908 --> 23:03.467
- Ooh, yeah!
- Yes!

23:05.634 --> 23:07.774

So, our inspiration was "Sister Act",

23:58.421 --> 24:00.558
and we are going to be doing improv,

24:00.583 --> 24:03.583
which was Callie's idea, because
she shot down all of mine.

24:06.886 --> 24:09.180
Malika's party is tomorrow night,

24:09.205 --> 24:10.574
and we still have nothing prepared,

24:10.598 --> 24:12.688
because you keep shooting
down all of my ideas.

24:12.713 --> 24:15.511
That's 'cause your ideas are
either silly or too much work.

24:15.536 --> 24:16.727
Silly how?

24:16.752 --> 24:18.352
"Mr. Sister"?

24:18.781 --> 24:20.960
No one wants to see us as drag kings.

24:20.985 --> 24:22.931
Okay, well, you come up with something

24:22.956 --> 24:25.049
that takes absolutely
no preparation, then.

24:26.167 --> 24:27.287
How about improv?

24:28.290 --> 24:31.450
So, can we get any
suggestions from the audience?

24:31.475 --> 24:34.158
Ooh! Sisters on a cruise.
Ha! Yeah, that's good.

24:36.307 --> 24:37.307
Okay.

24:37.923 --> 24:41.700
Fine. But remember that in
improv, it's "Yes, and..."

24:41.725 --> 24:43.650
which might be hard for the queen of no.

24:43.675 --> 24:45.170
Also, Raj is spending
the night tomorrow night,

24:45.194 --> 24:46.594
so you are going to Jamie's.

24:47.965 --> 24:51.107
- Are you listening?
- Yes, and goodnight.

24:54.251 --> 24:57.343
Yes, and maybe if you
studied a little harder,

24:57.368 --> 24:59.145
and spent a little
less time on the roof,

24:59.170 --> 25:02.297
you would have passed
the bar... tending exam,

25:02.322 --> 25:05.642
and I wouldn't be here
paying for our vacation.

25:06.377 --> 25:09.805
- This is real, right?
- Oh, yeah, it definitely is.

25:09.830 --> 25:12.698
You know, we're
family. Speaking of jobs,

25:12.723 --> 25:14.643
have you had any more sex
dreams about your boss?

25:17.366 --> 25:18.724
And, scene.

25:22.677 --> 25:24.477
Got good at the end, there.

25:27.099 --> 25:30.419
So... That was, uh, s... That is...

25:31.136 --> 25:32.512
interesting.

25:33.302 --> 25:35.130
Th... That was all made up.

25:35.633 --> 25:37.492
Yeah. Seemed made up.

25:39.395 --> 25:40.955
Should we just get this over with?

25:42.511 --> 25:44.311
You had sex with my mom?

25:44.336 --> 25:46.376
All right, I was... wasted.

25:47.319 --> 25:49.523
- When did this happen?
- The... The first night that she was here.

25:49.547 --> 25:53.616
I woke up in the morning,
and she was in my bed.

26:00.329 --> 26:02.321
Oops, I'm sorry. It's not funny.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.871
No, I-I-I'm... I'm sorry.

26:04.896 --> 26:08.542
Listen, Dennis. You did
not have sex with my mother.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.244
Okay? Malika brought her
home, and I spent all night

26:11.269 --> 26:14.789
holding her head over the toilet
while she barfed out her Botox.

26:14.814 --> 26:18.799
- Then why was she in my bed?
- I know my mother.

26:18.824 --> 26:21.217
She was trying to make
you think that you had sex

26:21.242 --> 26:22.650
so that you'd go back for seconds.

26:22.675 --> 26:25.293
God, I had no idea she was
that desperate to get laid.

26:26.714 --> 26:28.479
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. Are you okay?

26:28.503 --> 26:31.096
No, no, no, no. I'm...
I'm not... I'm not okay.

26:31.121 --> 26:33.674
I just hated myself thinking
that I had done that to you.

26:34.051 --> 26:37.169
Thinking that I had
ruined any chance of...

26:37.958 --> 26:39.240
Any chance of what?

26:41.598 --> 26:42.998
Of you ever trusting me.

26:47.149 --> 26:50.082
Don't worry. I trust you.

26:52.623 --> 26:55.022
You're my best friend.

27:01.457 --> 27:04.841
So, my card said "Breathe",

27:04.866 --> 27:06.924
and I don't know why.

27:07.648 --> 27:12.159

Better go get ready.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.350
Wait, get ready for what?

29:51.375 --> 29:53.575
By the way, you might
want to check your phone.

29:54.334 --> 29:57.068
You got a text from Evan.

30:02.076 --> 30:04.076
_

30:11.499 --> 30:13.739
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.915
I, uh... brought you something.

30:19.473 --> 30:22.416
Um, I'm... I'm not a poet, by any means.

30:22.524 --> 30:25.259
At all. Like I cannot do what you do.

30:25.284 --> 30:27.311
I'll let him use you, baby.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.838
But, um...

30:29.863 --> 30:33.290

unanimous need, unexpected

Entangled limbs and sudden
whims, no need to be polite.

30:55.698 --> 30:59.074
Ebony whispers and lip
quivers, gently into the night.

31:01.129 --> 31:03.310

Now that was surprising.

32:47.397 --> 32:51.007
Girl. Oh, my God!

32:56.093 --> 32:57.667
Thanks so much. See ya.

33:02.874 --> 33:04.074
So...

33:05.410 --> 33:07.070
What'd you think?

33:07.657 --> 33:09.766
I... think...

33:11.397 --> 33:12.397
It was hot.

33:14.558 --> 33:15.824
Really?

33:17.336 --> 33:18.336
Yeah.

33:20.664 --> 33:21.747
So...

33:22.770 --> 33:25.146
Is this what you want?

33:25.442 --> 33:28.460
For me to be more femme?

33:28.485 --> 33:30.276
'Cause that was really hard to learn,

33:30.301 --> 33:32.401
and I honestly don't
think that I could ever...

33:32.426 --> 33:35.710
- do that again without blowing out a knee.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:35.735 --> 33:37.735
What makes you think I
want you to be more femme?

33:38.402 --> 33:40.919
'Cause you're, like...

33:40.944 --> 33:44.130
presenting more masc, and...

33:44.155 --> 33:46.073
- You just said that was hot.
- Yeah.

33:46.098 --> 33:48.098
Alice, what was hot was your confidence.

33:48.949 --> 33:52.476
You weren't making fun of
yourself or your sexuality.

33:53.026 --> 33:57.137
Dude, you were like Beyonce. You
took your space and you owned it.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.837
And you were vulnerable.

33:59.411 --> 34:01.119
That's all I really want.

34:02.581 --> 34:06.366
When you make jokes when we're
in bed, it just pushes me away.

34:09.226 --> 34:10.574
Okay.

34:11.197 --> 34:12.197
I can work on that.

34:12.998 --> 34:14.338
I can work on it, too.

34:15.271 --> 34:17.029
I know that I push you away.

34:17.295 --> 34:20.847
Intimacy is scary as hell.

34:23.157 --> 34:26.492
But it can also be super sexy.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.585
He wasn't asking me if I was DTF.

34:35.610 --> 34:37.418
He wanted to know what it meant.

34:37.949 --> 34:39.395
Did you really just move in here

34:39.420 --> 34:41.152
because you wanted to sleep with Gael?

34:41.178 --> 34:42.335
No.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.925
We needed to find a place
that we could afford.

34:46.058 --> 34:47.601
And... I never hooked up with him.

34:47.626 --> 34:50.866
I haven't slept with anyone
since I've been in LA. Except you.

34:51.635 --> 34:54.661
Oh, well... There was this...

34:55.684 --> 34:56.857
What?

34:57.090 --> 34:59.949
- Threesome with a really nice couple.
- Uh...

35:00.712 --> 35:03.955
Okay. We'll circle back
to that later, but...

35:03.980 --> 35:06.430
I have a question. Did you
know Evan wanted to talk to you

35:06.455 --> 35:08.935
about his dating profile when
he asked you to have drinks?

35:09.471 --> 35:11.187
- No.
- You went anyway?

35:11.212 --> 35:14.238
Okay, well, if Evan asked you to
have a drink, what would you say?

35:14.263 --> 35:16.363
- That's different.
- Why? Because you're a man?

35:16.388 --> 35:19.055
- Yes.
- Okay. Wow. That is incredibly sexist.

35:19.080 --> 35:21.614
You really buy this
dating profile excuse?

35:21.639 --> 35:23.314
He's so obviously into you, Mariana.

35:23.339 --> 35:25.109
Well, if he's into me, I'm not into him.

35:25.134 --> 35:27.534
And I announced to everyone at
Speckulate that you're my boyfriend.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.082
Yeah, well, it's pretty
obvious I'm not your type.

35:29.106 --> 35:32.212
- What?
- I'm not a rich CEO, or a hot,

35:32.237 --> 35:34.252
brooding sculptor artist,

35:34.277 --> 35:36.877
- or a couple...
- You know what?

35:36.902 --> 35:39.106
If you can't believe
that I wanna be with you,

35:39.131 --> 35:41.042
nothing I can say
will ever convince you.

35:41.598 --> 35:42.739
And I'm done trying.

35:51.806 --> 35:53.614
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

35:55.484 --> 35:57.844
I'm sorry I didn't do my thing tonight.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.391
I will tell you my secret. Soon.

36:01.718 --> 36:03.968
- Okay.
- Happy birthday.

36:03.993 --> 36:06.309
Thank you. Mm, love you.

36:06.334 --> 36:08.818
Yeah. Love you, too.

36:17.548 --> 36:19.977
Appreciate you coming. Did you have fun?

36:20.001 --> 36:23.900
Yeah. Yeah, it's nice to
see all the people you have,

36:23.925 --> 36:24.925
who love you.

36:25.971 --> 36:27.499
I can why you didn't need me and Mom.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.018
You got a family.

36:31.399 --> 36:32.883
You are my family.

36:34.469 --> 36:37.844
After losing Mom, I realized
I've had a lot of regrets.

36:37.869 --> 36:39.539
And now it's too late.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.389
I thought that by
reaching out to our father,

36:41.414 --> 36:43.308
maybe we could have some type of family.

36:43.842 --> 36:46.952
Ah, look, we got each other.
And that's enough for me.

36:48.417 --> 36:52.060
And that is the best present I
could ask for at this birthday.

36:52.386 --> 36:53.686
Truly.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.936
I love you. And I'm still taller.

36:55.961 --> 36:57.710
Aw, man, yo!

36:58.282 --> 37:01.299
Yo. I gotta...

37:02.865 --> 37:05.082
- No, you didn't.
- I sure did.

37:05.107 --> 37:06.867
Are you serious?

37:06.892 --> 37:09.138
But check out all the likes
and comments you're getting.

37:09.163 --> 37:11.671
Check out this one, asking
when your next show is.

37:11.696 --> 37:14.630
See? This is what I'm talking about.

37:14.655 --> 37:16.683
This... is you.

37:16.708 --> 37:20.160
Just more of you than you're
usually willing to put out there.

37:35.793 --> 37:38.144
- Seriously?
- Let's do it.

37:38.169 --> 37:39.963
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- All right.

37:39.988 --> 37:41.796
Step into my barber shop.

37:41.821 --> 37:42.821
All right.

37:44.827 --> 37:49.381
All right, y'all. So I've had
my hair long since college.

37:49.406 --> 37:52.918
And... it's time for a new look.

37:53.637 --> 37:55.572
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, let's do it.

37:55.597 --> 37:57.739
Oh, my God.

37:57.764 --> 38:00.706
- Getting weaker. Let me see.
- Too late.

38:09.731 --> 38:12.859
- What's that?
- This is my voter registration stub.

38:13.687 --> 38:15.628
I've had this in my
wallet since I was 18

38:15.653 --> 38:16.897
and registered as a Republican.

38:21.990 --> 38:23.230
What are you doing?

38:25.254 --> 38:26.386
You are right.

38:28.234 --> 38:29.688
You know, if I don't believe in

38:29.713 --> 38:31.509
what the Party stands
for in this moment,

38:32.813 --> 38:33.933
I shouldn't be a part of it.

38:37.007 --> 38:38.725
However...

38:38.750 --> 38:40.510
that doesn't mean I'm
turning into a liberal.

38:43.351 --> 38:46.071
But seriously, I'm...
I'm open to listening.

38:47.123 --> 38:48.123
If you are.

38:56.132 --> 38:58.888
Well, I think Raj and I
just broke up, thanks to you.

38:58.913 --> 39:01.364
- Let's not do this here.
- Why not?

39:01.389 --> 39:04.380
- Everyone here knows our business.
- Thanks to you.

39:04.405 --> 39:07.400
Because you told everyone I moved
us in here so I could smash Gael.

39:07.425 --> 39:09.099
And that I had a sex
dream about my boss.

39:09.124 --> 39:11.178
Yeah, and you told everyone
that I didn't pass the bar.

39:11.202 --> 39:12.490
I got ten bucks on the little one.

39:12.514 --> 39:14.867
I don't know. Callie
look like she got hands.

39:14.892 --> 39:17.701
I'm sorry, okay? I screwed up.

39:17.726 --> 39:19.493
I'm not perfect.

39:19.518 --> 39:22.211
Oh. Did you hear that?

39:22.236 --> 39:24.953
Miss Judgmental just admitted
that she's not perfect.

39:24.978 --> 39:27.911
Yeah, and Miss "I don't
mind, we're family"

39:27.936 --> 39:29.516
wants to kick me out of our loft.

39:29.541 --> 39:30.959
That's not true. I just asked

39:30.984 --> 39:32.488
if you would spend the night with Jamie.

39:32.512 --> 39:34.616
- Yeah, maybe I'll move in with Jamie.
- Well, go right ahead.

39:34.640 --> 39:35.893
- Okay.
- Where are you going?

39:35.918 --> 39:37.584
- I'm not doing this, Mariana.
- Stop...

39:39.915 --> 39:41.587
Yes! Now that's some good theater!

39:47.230 --> 39:48.230
Oh, we doing this?

40:00.403 --> 40:01.628
Only because it's my birthday.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.827
Cray.

40:21.293 --> 40:22.533
What's going on?

40:22.918 --> 40:24.885
Uh, we fell in.

40:26.983 --> 40:28.648
Listen, um...

40:29.694 --> 40:33.161
I'm sorry. You're
right. This is my issue.

40:34.511 --> 40:37.195
From now on, Hot Raj is gonna be...

40:38.093 --> 40:39.351
Hot Confident Raj.

40:41.326 --> 40:42.851
That is hot.

40:42.876 --> 40:44.693
Now, here. Help me out.

40:44.718 --> 40:47.227
Oh, okay. Oh, my phone!

40:54.422 --> 40:55.862
All right!

40:58.284 --> 41:00.515
What have you done to your hair?

41:00.539 --> 41:01.639
It looks good.

41:02.008 --> 41:03.237
You want some of mine?

41:03.262 --> 41:05.772
Well, don't just stand there! Get in!

41:05.797 --> 41:07.768
Do it! Do it!

41:08.510 --> 41:10.009
So why don't you?

41:10.788 --> 41:13.288
- What?
- Move in with me.

41:19.311 --> 41:22.771
Wow! This turned out to be
a great party, after all.

41:22.796 --> 41:27.896
Woo! I am blessed!
