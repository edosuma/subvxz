WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:06.223
Bomb!

00:06.267 --> 00:08.443
You got no one to watch
- your back while I'm in here.
- I got Travis.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
Promise you'll watch
your back with him, too.

00:10.314 --> 00:12.838
We should be able to produce
about 4,000 pills an hour.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
What's the ETA
on the first shipment?

00:14.101 --> 00:15.276
Should be ready
by tomorrow morning.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.886
Why are you stopping?

00:18.670 --> 00:20.846
Guessing there's a side of drugs
with all these steaks?

00:20.890 --> 00:22.935
Tonya: I lost a shipment.
The truck was hijacked.

00:22.979 --> 00:25.068
Tubb: You thinking
this is cartel-related?

00:25.112 --> 00:26.852
Jenny: Can't say
I'd be shocked.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.290
Why are we pulling out
- of Canada?
- Things change.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.987
Just tell us
what's going on.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.206
Reenu, I said eat.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.772
Lila:
Kate Garza.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.948
Travis turned her
into his informant,

00:35.992 --> 00:37.298
and then he fell in love
with her.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.734
Veer had her killed.

00:38.777 --> 00:41.258
And Travis is trying
to find out?

00:41.302 --> 00:43.565
I believe
he wants more than that.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.089
We're just gonna kill you,
then dissolve your body in acid.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.570
You let them kill me,
you're never gonna figure
out my secret.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.311
What do you think
is gonna save your life?

00:50.354 --> 00:52.269
Stone is a cop.

00:52.313 --> 00:53.705
Ren:
I believe you know Bob.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.490
He said some really interesting
things about you.

00:55.533 --> 00:58.145
- Are you a cop?
- No. Come on, you know me.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.103
Do I?Would a cop do this?

01:12.289 --> 01:14.291
Morning.
Jenny: Morning.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.598
You gonna tell me what we're
doing all the way out here?

01:16.641 --> 01:18.513
Do you trust me,
Jenny?

01:18.556 --> 01:20.776
Do I trust you?

01:20.819 --> 01:24.040
The words every woman
loves to hear.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.260
What is it
you want to show me?

01:38.359 --> 01:40.143
What the hell
is this?

01:40.187 --> 01:42.058
That's Robert MacIntyre.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.407
Yeah,
Survivalist Bob.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.279
I know.
He's killed two of my deputies.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.063
What's he doing
in the back of your truck?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.370
I've been instructed
to disappear this man.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.154
The Bhullars?
Yeah.

01:51.198 --> 01:53.374
And I thought I'd save you
the trouble of looking for him.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.377
You can't expect me to let you
walk off and bury him.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.816
Well, it's not
up to you, Jenny.

02:04.689 --> 02:07.997
What is happening to you,
Travis?

02:08.040 --> 02:09.607
Are you so far gone

02:09.651 --> 02:11.043
that you don't understand
how insane this is?

02:11.087 --> 02:12.654
Wait, now you're questioning
my sanity?

02:12.697 --> 02:15.178
I'm questioning
where your loyalty lies.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.180
My loyalty?
That's rich.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.660
Well,
I'll let you know

02:18.703 --> 02:20.357
where I --
where I bury him,

02:20.401 --> 02:21.750
so when
the time comes,

02:21.793 --> 02:24.100
you can make
your big arrest, okay?

02:26.276 --> 02:27.973
You're putting me between
a rock and a hard place.

02:28.017 --> 02:29.584
We can't do this.

02:29.627 --> 02:32.195
<i>You</i> can't do this.
Arrest whoever did this.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.980
Arrest who?
Arrest who?

02:35.024 --> 02:36.373
Who am I gonna arrest,
huh?

02:36.417 --> 02:37.983
It ain't Ren
and her father,

02:38.027 --> 02:40.290
'cause I can't connect them
to it, Jenny.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.422
Then who did this?

02:42.945 --> 02:45.643
I don't know.

02:45.687 --> 02:49.125
Okay, Travis, I-I need you
to be honest with me.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.346
What really happened
between the Bhullars and Kate?

02:52.389 --> 02:55.000
So the handler got to you?

02:55.044 --> 02:56.219
I needed
to talk to her

02:56.263 --> 02:57.786
to figure out
what's going on with you.

02:57.829 --> 02:59.614
What's going on with me?
Tell me.

03:01.442 --> 03:04.009
Kate wasn't
your partner.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.055
She was
your informant.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.013
- Jenny, stop it right now.
- You fell in love with her...

03:08.057 --> 03:09.450
Jenny,
stop this, okay?

03:09.493 --> 03:11.234
...and the Bhullars
killed her. Jenny.

03:11.278 --> 03:12.409
Why couldn't you just
tell me that?

03:12.453 --> 03:14.498
What else
do you want from me?!

03:14.542 --> 03:17.501
What do you --
What do you want from <i>me?</i>

03:17.545 --> 03:20.722
You are asking me to unsee
what I just saw.

03:20.765 --> 03:23.464
You know
I can't do that.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.475
I love you, Travis,

03:34.518 --> 03:38.043
but this --
this is too far.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.438
Just -- Just go bury
your body.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.311
I-I can't
do this anymore.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.942
So he just stabbed a guy
with a steak knife?

04:06.985 --> 04:08.465
Yeah,
pretty much.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.337
- You're okay with that?
- You're not?

04:11.468 --> 04:13.209
I'm just saying,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.124
violence can be a liability
in the wrong hands.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.387
And an effective tool
in the right one.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.565
Oh, you're only okay
with violence

04:21.609 --> 04:23.872
as long as you don't have to
do it yourself.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.395
That is not -- That's not
what I'm saying.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.179
Sounds like it.
Dad is right.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.659
You're gonna need
to toughen up.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.313
This is Montana.
Things are hands-on here.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.535
So, what?

04:34.578 --> 04:35.753
You trust
this Stone guy now?

04:35.797 --> 04:37.799
I didn't say that.
I don't trust anyone.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.367
But we need him.
For now.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.369
I just hope you know
who you're letting in the house.

04:42.412 --> 04:43.892
He's not family.

04:43.935 --> 04:45.807
I don't trust family, either.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.777
You can trust me.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.607
Ren, I know we've had
a rough road, but...

05:03.651 --> 05:05.000
Oh, God.

05:05.043 --> 05:07.568
...I am
your brother,

05:07.611 --> 05:09.744
and I'm all you got
right now.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.225
Let me be there
when you talk to Dad about this.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.576
I'll take
some of the heat.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.578
No, it's my man,
it's my mess.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.235
Have you
talked to him lately?

05:23.279 --> 05:25.020
Dad? No.

05:25.063 --> 05:29.416
Yeah, I caught him staring
out the window the other day.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.939
It was weird.

05:30.982 --> 05:32.462
Daydreaming about Alicia?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.597
Maybe Dad's lonely
and she makes him happy?

05:36.640 --> 05:38.250
Maybe that's the problem.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.601
We've never actually
seen him happy before.

05:40.644 --> 05:42.646
Oh.
That's weird.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.260
Oh, no.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.402
God,
knock much?

05:59.446 --> 06:00.838
Where is Mason?

06:00.882 --> 06:02.536
He didn't come home
last night.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.538
- I don't know.
- Weren't you with him?

06:04.581 --> 06:06.583
Some.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.542
Okay, either you were
or you weren't.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.805
His truck's gone,
he's not answering his phone.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.285
- So?
- He was supposed to help me pull fence,

06:13.329 --> 06:16.593
<i>so</i> unless you find him,
you're taking his place.

06:16.637 --> 06:19.553
I have a real job, thanks.

06:19.596 --> 06:22.338
Do you?
Find your brother, please.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.687
Good morning, Dad.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.297
Love you.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.605
Love you, too.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.694
Now get your ass out of bed
and find your brother.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.609
Yeah. Geez.

06:34.045 --> 06:37.658
<i>♪ Yeah</i>♪

06:37.701 --> 06:42.010

06:57.417 --> 06:59.462
At least you didn't drive, idiot.

07:03.510 --> 07:08.819
Mason?!

07:08.863 --> 07:12.606
Mason!

07:18.089 --> 07:20.570
Get up, dude.

07:24.792 --> 07:27.272
Come on.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.710
It's time to go.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.106
Mason?

07:35.150 --> 07:37.544
Mason.

07:37.587 --> 07:41.069
Mas.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.984
Get up.

07:43.027 --> 07:45.595
Mason, get up.

07:45.639 --> 07:46.857
Please.

08:12.796 --> 08:15.320
Been a while
since I beat you to a scene.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.714
Sorry.
It's been a morning.

08:17.758 --> 08:19.890
Is it Travis?
What happened?

08:19.934 --> 08:23.024
I'll talk about it later.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.243
What's he doing back
so soon?

08:25.287 --> 08:27.550
Oh, he bull-dogged his way
through recovery.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
I figured you of all people
could relate.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.685
Morning, Hoyt.
Sheriff Walter Tubb.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.556
Someone's back
a little early.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.906
You know me. Justice never
sleeps and all that.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.560
So,
how you doing?

08:37.604 --> 08:39.736
With recovery
and everything?

08:39.780 --> 08:41.956
One day at a time.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.002
It's good
to have you back.

08:47.004 --> 08:50.007
- So, what do we have?
- Uh, sister called it in.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.009
Found the body this morning
when the brother didn't
come home last night.

08:52.053 --> 08:54.185
- Where's the sister?
- I sent her home to prep the parents.

08:54.229 --> 08:55.883
I figured it's best
to keep them from the scene.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.462
Jenny: Oh, my God.

09:10.506 --> 09:13.509
It's Mason Ford.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.688
I know
the whole family.

09:35.096 --> 09:37.838
Mona.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.622
Richard.

09:39.666 --> 09:42.843
Please just tell me
it isn't true.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.496
Mason can't be dead.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.846
I'm so sorry.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.812
Let's go inside
and talk.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.260
So, what are you doing
to solve this?

10:09.304 --> 10:10.740
Jenny: We have to
follow protocol

10:10.784 --> 10:12.655
and wait for
the coroner's report.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.701
That'll give us
a sense of timing

10:14.744 --> 10:16.746
and circumstances
around Mason's death.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.708
I can understand
how devastating this is.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.797
But all we can do right now
is just wait.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.320
Richard:

10:25.363 --> 10:28.279
That's your answer?
"Waiting."

10:28.323 --> 10:30.760
You're gonna wait
for someone else,

10:30.804 --> 10:33.894
who's gonna wait
for a report to be done,

10:33.937 --> 10:39.073
and we'll just sit here with
our hands folded waiting, Jenny.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.336
Someone killed my son.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.905
I know
this isn't easy to hear,

10:44.948 --> 10:46.080
but Mason's death

10:46.123 --> 10:48.169
isn't being ruled a homicide
just yet.

10:49.561 --> 10:50.780
What else could it be?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.920
Have there been any issues
with Mason lately?

10:59.963 --> 11:02.705
Depression?
Drinking? Drugs?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.315
What the hell
are you getting at?

11:04.359 --> 11:06.883
Honey, she's just
asking questions. It's her job.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.058
No!

11:08.102 --> 11:10.713
My son
did not use drugs.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.632
Hayden, honey,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.416
is there something
you need to tell me?

11:21.942 --> 11:23.291
Sweetheart?

11:26.381 --> 11:27.991
No.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.385
He drank beer sometimes,
but --

11:31.995 --> 11:33.867
Take it easy, sir.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.217
Hey.
He -- He just lost his son.

11:36.260 --> 11:37.740
It's okay.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.786
You come into
my home

11:39.829 --> 11:42.571
and you accuse my son
of being a drug addict.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.921
They're just trying
to help us.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.923
Ah,
the hell they are.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.019
Is there...

11:56.063 --> 11:58.543
anything else
you want to ask us?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.937
Not right now.

12:00.981 --> 12:04.027
I-If there's anything
that you need,

12:04.071 --> 12:06.769
anything at all,
I am here for you.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.423
For all of you.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.384
I promise you,

12:13.428 --> 12:14.908
I'm gonna get you
the answers you deserve.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.485
Lindor:

12:27.529 --> 12:29.487
I thought you said
just a few boxes?

12:29.531 --> 12:31.968
Oh, I guess
I underestimated.

12:32.012 --> 12:33.840
But, you know,
it's hard to assess the clutter

12:33.883 --> 12:35.493
until you start
organizing it.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.278
Oh.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.062
Hey, maybe you should
take a break?

12:39.106 --> 12:42.587
Huh? No.
No, I'm good.

12:42.631 --> 12:44.633
Cheaper than physical therapy.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.156
I'm glad you called.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.854
How are you holding up?

12:47.897 --> 12:49.725
Oh,
hasn't been easy,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.988
but I listen
to a lot of podcasts about UFOs

12:52.032 --> 12:53.903
to help
- pass the time.
- Seen any yet?

12:53.947 --> 12:55.426
No.
Yeah.

12:55.470 --> 12:56.819
It's not my thing.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.690
I'm on
a tech break.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.215
Reading.
Walks in the woods.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.825
Taking a woodworking class.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.174
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.523
I'm gonna build
a table.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.916
No nails.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.005
Mortise, tenon, pegs.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.746
Yeah, I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.835
Going with the flow
of the wood.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.315
Yeah, maybe we should keep it
to work talk.
Roger that.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.621
Put an APB out
on Scarlet.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.842
And, uh, then there's
the question of who killed Wolf.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.801
- Try not to go there.
- Oh, we're there.

13:23.367 --> 13:26.327
Hey, maybe I could help out
around here.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.764
I mean,
beyond de-cluttering.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.722
Lend a hand
while I'm on medical leave.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.115
Yeah, grab a desk.
We got work to do.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.422
Okay,
that was easy.

13:34.465 --> 13:37.251
You say that now.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.563
Seems like a waste.

13:45.607 --> 13:49.872
I can't look at them anymore, either.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.091
She's gone.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.530
You need help
cleaning her stuff?

13:55.573 --> 13:57.097
Uh, maybe.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.362
She loved
her herb garden.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.799
When she couldn't
do anything else,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.801
she'd somehow still get up
to water it.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.673
It's pretty.
Wasn't always.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.371
Not sure
if it's the desert

14:10.414 --> 14:12.068
or if she never had
a green thumb,

14:12.112 --> 14:14.679
but they kept dying
on her.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.160
What changed?

14:19.119 --> 14:21.817
She just
replanted them.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.079
Over and over.

14:23.123 --> 14:25.603
And finally, just...

14:33.133 --> 14:34.047
You know,
this last week,

14:34.090 --> 14:36.092
it meant the world
to her.

14:37.398 --> 14:38.616
And to me.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.272
I'm glad I came.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.842
And not just
for the free takeout.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.979
I think we owe it to her
to finally cook something.

14:53.022 --> 14:54.850
Put those herbs
to good use.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.591
- Cook?
- Yeah.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.593
You and me.
Something special.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.118
Sure.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.164
That'd be nice.

15:09.473 --> 15:13.129
There's no such thing
as overstaying your welcome.

15:13.173 --> 15:15.827
This could be
your home again.

15:19.266 --> 15:21.833
I got a career, Dad.

15:21.877 --> 15:25.011
Friends.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.100
You know, I've...

15:27.143 --> 15:29.972
built a life
for myself in Helena.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.670
Yeah.

15:32.714 --> 15:35.673
I'm -- I'm --
I'm gonna miss you.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.899
So visit.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.034
Do you really
mean that?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.037
Yep.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.446
What's this?
We got company?

16:09.490 --> 16:11.709
Where'd you dump
the body?

16:11.753 --> 16:13.233
The woods.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.844
Well,
that's dirty work.

16:15.887 --> 16:19.543
You sweat in places
a man shouldn't sweat.

16:21.241 --> 16:23.025
Lemme see.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.375
What are you
talking about?
Your hands.

16:25.419 --> 16:27.247
See, I get dirt
under my nails.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.204
I have to use
a brush.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.336
Calluses.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.389
You still think
I'm a cop?

16:39.433 --> 16:42.740
Well, you're either a cop
or you're not.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.046
Doesn't matter.

16:49.878 --> 16:52.098
Whoever you are,

16:52.141 --> 16:54.926
if you even think about
hurting Ren,

16:54.970 --> 16:57.668
I'm gonna
put you down myself.

Yeah, I just, uh,
couldn't be at home.

17:25.218 --> 17:27.872
I mean, you saw my dad.
I'm sorry about him.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.570
No, don't be.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.789
He's heartbroken,
and rightfully so.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.226
I can
understand that.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.577

Mason died
of a drug overdose.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.906
You knew.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.998
Honey,
I've known you forever.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.174
You can trust me.

18:08.217 --> 18:11.438
Is there something
you need to tell me?

18:13.744 --> 18:16.356
I-I found these
on him.

18:19.228 --> 18:21.317
I know I shouldn't have
taken them.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.319
I-I panicked.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.495
I didn't want
my parents knowing.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.716
Do you know where
he might have gotten them?

18:28.759 --> 18:30.326
No.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.198
I don't get it.

18:32.241 --> 18:35.375
Mason didn't do drugs.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.812
It just --
It doesn't make sense.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.384
I am here for you
and your family.

18:44.427 --> 18:45.950
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.350
Oh.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.831
Hey, I didn't expect you
'til later.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.964
Let me get you
that lease.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.358
So, um,
I worked my magic

19:02.402 --> 19:05.970
and got us another five years
at the same rate.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.407
Of course you did.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.060
Mm-hmm.

19:09.104 --> 19:10.323
Cassie see this yet?

19:10.366 --> 19:13.195
No, not yet.
I'm giving her some space.

19:13.239 --> 19:16.067
I mean, I say that she should
take a little more time away

19:16.111 --> 19:17.460
considering everything
that happened,

19:17.504 --> 19:19.245
but we both know
that's not how she operates.

19:19.288 --> 19:21.899
Work can be
a useful distraction.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.423
Mm-hmm.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.642
How are things
with you?

19:27.818 --> 19:30.430
Been better.

19:31.822 --> 19:33.563
Mona Ford's son
was found dead today.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.435
Mason?

19:35.478 --> 19:37.001
No.

19:37.045 --> 19:38.307
His poor parents.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.396
W-What --
I mean, what happened?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.790
Still trying
to piece it together.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.400
I had to
notify the family today.

19:44.444 --> 19:45.706
How'd that go?

19:45.749 --> 19:47.403
Never easy.

19:47.447 --> 19:50.319
And Richard,
you know how he gets.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.713
You know I do. I went through
recovery with him.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.323
I gotta reach out to him
and make sure he does not slip.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.414
No matter what,

19:58.458 --> 20:00.329
a parent
always blames themself.

20:01.765 --> 20:04.464
Um, thank you.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.205
Thank you
for holding down the fort.

20:08.381 --> 20:10.470
Keep me posted
on the Fords, hmm?

20:10.513 --> 20:13.168
You got it.

20:42.806 --> 20:43.938
Can I help you
with something?

20:43.981 --> 20:46.070
Somebody's outside.

20:54.122 --> 20:55.732
This is crazy.
We should wait for Dhruv.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.299
Shh.
Hear that?

20:57.343 --> 20:59.562
Man: "...hear the lightest music
of human behavior,

20:59.606 --> 21:04.132
the tender connection
between men and galaxies.

21:04.175 --> 21:05.742
So I sit on the edge,

21:05.786 --> 21:08.528
wagging my feet
above the abyss,

21:08.571 --> 21:10.312
the fatal plummet.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.706
Tonight the moon
will be in my lap."Is that Dad?

21:12.749 --> 21:18.146
"This is my job, to study
the universe from my bridge.

21:18.189 --> 21:21.497
I have the sky,
the sea, the faint --"

21:21.541 --> 21:22.498
What are you doing?

21:22.542 --> 21:24.500
Oh.

21:24.544 --> 21:27.155
Just a poem.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.549
"Bridge"
by Jim Harrison,

21:29.592 --> 21:30.767
rest in peace.

21:30.811 --> 21:33.770
Uh...why?

21:37.165 --> 21:38.514
<i>Chalo.</i>

21:38.558 --> 21:40.821
Let's -- Let's go inside
and talk.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.258
It's -- It's time.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.398
It's totally
my fault.

21:52.441 --> 21:55.357
I told him to go outside
to get some fresh air.

21:55.401 --> 21:58.142
It's not your fault, darling.

21:58.186 --> 22:01.711
I, like,
hate poetry.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.931
I mean,
who has the time?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.367
Someday,
perhaps.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.761
Dad.

22:07.804 --> 22:09.850
Are you okay?

22:09.893 --> 22:12.983
You don't have to
answer them right now.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.594
No,
it's okay.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.204
My children
are worried.

22:16.247 --> 22:19.990
About me, about their future,
our future.

22:21.992 --> 22:24.865
I don't know. I find it calms
the mind to recite things.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.215
So,
that's the poem.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.565
And the rest,
please?

22:31.611 --> 22:33.961
Reenu,
always the impatient one.

22:34.004 --> 22:35.876
Just like your mother.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.399
Blessing
and a curse.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.576
Veer, darling,
we've talked about this.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.449
Backhanded compliments --
not good.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.059
Raise people up.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.452
Yes,
of course.

22:46.495 --> 22:47.801
You can do it.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.415
We ran into some trouble
in Toronto.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.462
Remember Vikram?

22:56.505 --> 22:57.898
Vikram Dhar?

22:57.941 --> 22:59.421
With the stutter?

22:59.465 --> 23:02.250
Yes.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.600
Yeah, well,
he betrayed me.

23:04.644 --> 23:07.908
It was actually Alicia
who caught it.

23:09.692 --> 23:12.782
Vikram managed to drain
several of our accounts,

23:12.826 --> 23:19.354
and I took matters
into my own hands,

23:19.398 --> 23:22.009
and I tried to kill him,
but he got away.

23:22.052 --> 23:25.578
Yeah, it's embarrassing
to be fooled

23:25.621 --> 23:29.538
by somebody so unimportant,
somebody not family.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.671
So, what does
- that mean exactly?
- Wait, Vik did what?

23:31.714 --> 23:32.802
Like,
is it the Kapoors?

23:32.846 --> 23:34.674
It doesn't matter.

23:34.717 --> 23:39.679
Hey, we -- we are in
Big Sky country now.

23:39.722 --> 23:44.118
I have my family,
my -- my health,

23:44.161 --> 23:47.643
and now,
you have the truth.

23:47.687 --> 23:51.908
Dad, honestly,
how bad is it?

23:55.564 --> 23:57.523
This line
of questioning

23:57.566 --> 24:00.482
is teetering
on the disrespectful.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.920
Okay, we just --
we just want to know...

24:03.964 --> 24:06.619
are they gonna
come after us?

24:06.662 --> 24:11.537
Yeah, well, if they do,
then God help them all.

24:22.591 --> 24:25.072
Tonya: Mm.
Smells amazing.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.553
What are you making?

24:28.771 --> 24:29.990
Donno?

24:30.033 --> 24:31.861
Pot roast.

24:31.905 --> 24:33.863
It'll be good.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.343
Or not.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.519
I'm sure
it will be great.

24:38.912 --> 24:40.522
Something wrong?
No.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.916
Well,
you're mister black cloud.

24:42.959 --> 24:45.092
So?
It happens.

24:45.135 --> 24:46.572
You can talk
to me, Donno.

24:46.615 --> 24:48.661
I know.

24:49.836 --> 24:51.751
Now?

24:51.794 --> 24:54.362
Or you can
hold it in.

24:54.405 --> 24:55.711
I mean,
that's always good.

24:57.800 --> 25:00.542
I'm a good listener.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.761
Waitress.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.719
Sorta comes with
the job.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.593
Talk to me.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.771
I think
there's trouble coming.

25:11.814 --> 25:13.555
Okay?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.644
Not sure
what to do with that.

25:15.688 --> 25:18.168
You're gonna need to give me
a few more details.

25:18.212 --> 25:20.170
I'm team Ren.

25:20.214 --> 25:22.912
Me, too.
Not like I am.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.219
Sure.
I get that.

25:25.262 --> 25:26.568
I'm worried about her.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.483
Her family --
I mean, her dad,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.833
he's dangerous,
he's unpredictable.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.706
I got that.
Him showing up
isn't good.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.404
And Stone.

25:36.447 --> 25:38.406
I don't trust him.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.626
Whatever happens,

25:40.669 --> 25:42.758
we have to
have Ren's back.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.499
We will.

25:44.543 --> 25:48.198
She believes in you
for a reason.

25:48.242 --> 25:51.637
You work hard,
you have good ideas,

25:51.680 --> 25:53.421
but are you loyal?

25:53.464 --> 25:55.684
Of course I am.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.643
How do you mean?

25:57.686 --> 26:00.776
You asked me once

26:00.820 --> 26:05.215
if you were gonna have to
kill people working for Ren.

26:05.259 --> 26:07.957
Might just get your answer
before all this is over.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.488
I'll tell you,
it is so nice

26:17.532 --> 26:20.013
having warm bodies
in this office again.

26:20.056 --> 26:22.624
You know,
you may come to regret this.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.452
Cassie says
I talk too much.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.758
Yeah, well,
better than listening

26:25.801 --> 26:27.194
to all the voices
in my head all day long.

26:28.282 --> 26:29.544
Settling in, I see.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.067
Jerrie!
My sweet girl!

26:31.111 --> 26:32.634
Oh!

26:32.678 --> 26:34.505
Honey!
Oh, I missed you.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.637
I missed you.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.508
Hey.
Hi.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.815
I didn't think you'd be back
for a few weeks.

26:39.859 --> 26:41.817
Well, if I had known
you were gunning for my job,

26:41.861 --> 26:43.732
I would have
come sooner.

26:43.776 --> 26:45.125
So,
bring me up to speed.

26:45.168 --> 26:46.866
How much time
do you have?

26:46.909 --> 26:47.997
Depends.

26:48.041 --> 26:49.433
What are
we working on?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.305
Wolf?
The Syndicate?

26:52.872 --> 26:55.222
Yeah.
It's like you read my mind.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.702
I'm all yours.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.664
Hey.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.058
We got
the forensics back

27:05.101 --> 27:06.712
on those pills
that killed Mason Ford.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.365
And?

27:08.409 --> 27:10.846
I'd rather not
do it here.

27:15.764 --> 27:17.026
Synthetic opioids.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.898
Fentanyl.
Here in Helena.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.334
We knew that
from the coroner's report.

27:20.377 --> 27:22.031
Yeah, but these are cut
with something.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.903
Makes them stronger,
last longer,

27:23.946 --> 27:25.339
heightens the effects.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.906
Which makes it easier
to overdose on.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.168
Yep.
Cheaper for the maker.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.345
Do we know
what it is?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.564
They're running more tests
to be sure.

27:33.608 --> 27:36.045
Drugs. You ask me,
bring back Just Say No.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.307
The fried egg,
"This is your brain."

27:37.351 --> 27:38.744
That was --
That was powerful stuff.

27:38.787 --> 27:40.615
Deputy, please.
I have a migraine.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.051
It's the Bhullars.
We all know that.

27:42.095 --> 27:43.357
You know,
back when it was just

27:43.400 --> 27:45.402
Dietrich and his gang,
it was easy.

27:45.446 --> 27:47.404
We knew who they were.
Everyone played on their
side of the fence.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.580
It's always been
the Bhullars.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.104
The only difference now is that
they're here, in our backyard.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.758
And if they keep
cutting their batches,

27:52.801 --> 27:54.194
more people
are gonna die.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.717
We need
to nip this in the butt.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.327
It's actually bud, sir.
With a "D".

27:57.371 --> 27:59.721
Nip it in the bud.
Butt, two T's --

27:59.765 --> 28:01.723
that could be a trigger word
- for some of the younger --
- Deputy!

28:01.767 --> 28:03.943
If we could just trace this
back to the Bhullars,

28:03.986 --> 28:05.205
we could
take them down.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.902
Find out
how Mason got this.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.904
Copy.

28:11.907 --> 28:14.127
No, you can't quit, Bryce.

28:14.170 --> 28:15.911
We have a shipment

28:15.955 --> 28:17.434
that should've been
on the road hours ago.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.958
Job's way too risky.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.960
After what happened
to Jamison, I'm out.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.875
Alright, why don't we sit down
and talk about it?

28:22.918 --> 28:24.746
Don't need to.
I'm done.

28:26.008 --> 28:28.184
Donno: She's not done
talking to you.

28:35.452 --> 28:38.673
Mountain West Three-draw champ
2017 and 2019.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.892
What happened
in '18?

28:39.935 --> 28:41.807
I didn't compete.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.765
Divorce.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.898
Go on, Ginsu boy. Come at me
with that fish shucker.

28:45.941 --> 28:47.726
I will show you
what I got.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.640
Can we
not do this?

28:49.684 --> 28:51.425
Sorry, Tonya.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.427
My guys and I
are out.

28:53.470 --> 28:57.170
What if I up your rate,
say, 20%?

28:57.213 --> 28:58.649
20% ain't worth
dying for.

28:58.693 --> 29:00.216
That was
a one-time thing, okay?

29:00.260 --> 29:01.783
The guy
who killed Jamison,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.045
he's not
going to be a problem.

29:05.091 --> 29:07.223
Uh-oh,
knives out time,

29:07.267 --> 29:09.138
or you're just
happy to see me.

29:09.182 --> 29:11.793
These Montanans
are problematic.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.621
I'm sure Tonya has it covered,
and if she doesn't,

29:13.664 --> 29:14.840
then you can play
stick and poke.

29:14.883 --> 29:17.059
Okay.
Tonya,
got a problem?

29:17.103 --> 29:19.279
Nope.
Handling it.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.802
See, Donno?

29:20.846 --> 29:21.977
Girl power.

29:22.021 --> 29:22.978
Mm.

29:25.851 --> 29:27.896
You see that nice lady
behind me?

29:27.940 --> 29:29.985
She don't look nice.

29:30.029 --> 29:32.205
Kinda sexy,
definitely scary.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.815
But nice, nah.

29:33.859 --> 29:37.732
If you walk,
she will kill us both.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.517
Now,
do we have a deal?

29:40.561 --> 29:42.955
Thinking you double
my fee,

29:42.998 --> 29:44.870
seeing as both our lives
depend on it.

29:44.913 --> 29:47.046
I said 20%.

29:47.089 --> 29:49.831
I like double.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.224
With Jamison dead,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.487
the word's out
about that cargo.

29:53.530 --> 29:55.532
Extra risk
comes with a price.

29:55.576 --> 29:58.840
Double it is.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.418
- Problem solved?
- Doubled his fee.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.681
Is that in the budget
I gave you?

30:13.724 --> 30:15.901
Don't worry,
low-balled him to begin.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.076
We're good.

30:17.119 --> 30:19.861
See, Donno,
no blood spilled.

30:19.905 --> 30:21.732
Girl power.

30:21.776 --> 30:22.864
Donno: Mm.

30:34.267 --> 30:35.877
I could teach you
if you want.

30:35.921 --> 30:38.097
It helps clear the mind
of clutter

30:38.140 --> 30:40.012
so you can focus on
what's important.

30:40.055 --> 30:42.753
What's important
to <i>you,</i> Alicia?

30:42.797 --> 30:44.494
Your dad.

30:45.931 --> 30:48.803
It's cheesy, I know,
but it's true.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.067
I didn't think it was possible
to find love again.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.287
And then
I met your dad...

30:54.330 --> 30:55.505
I don't wanna
talk about that.

30:55.549 --> 30:59.466
Oh, I know.
It's gross, right?

30:59.509 --> 31:03.339
So let's talk about you
and about last night.

31:03.383 --> 31:06.473
I bet you have
a ton of questions.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.518
Not really.
Jag looked into it. It's true.

31:08.562 --> 31:09.955
Ah, sneaky.

31:09.998 --> 31:11.913
I like it.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.567
Are we in danger?

31:13.610 --> 31:16.831
- Financial or other?
- Does it matter?

31:16.875 --> 31:19.094
If we don't have money,
then we don't have protection.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.618
Don't tell me
we're broke.

31:23.185 --> 31:27.624
He thinks that they will
send someone to take him out.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.540
But the hope is,
Montana, long way.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.978
Out of sight,
out of mind.

31:33.021 --> 31:34.588
Why can't he just
tell me this himself?

31:34.631 --> 31:36.024
It's -- It's like I'm still
his little girl.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.156
Hm. Same.

31:38.635 --> 31:41.073
Oh, my dad.
Not -- Not Veer.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.118
That would be weird.

31:43.162 --> 31:45.425
I get it.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.514
Maybe you should just
not talk to him.

31:47.557 --> 31:50.082
I mean
not about business.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.000
Do you want my advice?

31:56.349 --> 31:58.133
Sure.
Go ahead.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.008
He needs to hand off
the business to one of you.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.097
Get out
before he gets taken out.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.750
So he has
a choice to make.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.970
You or Jag. Well,
it should be me.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.319
He's old school.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.974
Only men can run things,
blah, blah, blah,

32:13.018 --> 32:14.454
and all that
other crap

32:14.497 --> 32:16.978
that we've been dealing with
like since forever.

32:17.022 --> 32:20.068
But Jag. Really?
Dad knows that he's weak.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.548
Yeah,
pretty much.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.464
But I told him maybe
both of you could run things.

32:24.507 --> 32:25.987
But did he listen
to me?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.075
No.
Of course not.

32:27.119 --> 32:29.991
Uh,
Montana was <i>my</i> idea.

32:30.035 --> 32:31.471
He knows that.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.212
Okay,
none of this matters.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.474
He's never gonna retire.

32:34.517 --> 32:36.171
And I know that.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.868
But I also know

32:37.912 --> 32:42.003
that if one of you
was going to take over...

32:42.047 --> 32:45.224
I think
it should be you.

32:45.267 --> 32:47.661
You just
have to show him.

32:58.193 --> 33:01.022
We picked up dinner
on the way home.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.458
Fried chicken.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.373
Still hot
if you want some.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.201
Where were you
and your mother today?

33:07.637 --> 33:10.162
We went and talked to Jenny
at the station.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.860
She had some
follow-up questions.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.863
Dad, she's just
trying to help.

33:17.256 --> 33:20.215
All she and her band of idiots
are gonna do

33:20.259 --> 33:22.043
is waste your time.

33:27.353 --> 33:31.096
Do you have any idea
what he was doing out there?

33:31.139 --> 33:33.054
All by himself?

33:39.495 --> 33:40.844
No.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.260
You couldn't text?

34:05.304 --> 34:08.002
Been running around
all day.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.269
How long you gonna hold this
surveillance footage over me?

34:14.313 --> 34:16.880
- Donno showed me.
- Why do you care?

34:16.924 --> 34:19.013
Same team,
right?

34:19.057 --> 34:21.015
You okay?

34:21.059 --> 34:22.930
Yeah, I'm fine.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.888
It's just family.

34:24.932 --> 34:27.543
My dad's
got a new girlfriend.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.154
It's a whole thing.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.765
Yeah, well,
I-I know how that goes.

34:31.808 --> 34:34.289
Yeah, hey,
if -- if you want,

34:34.333 --> 34:37.553
I could do some digging on her
for you, you know?

34:37.597 --> 34:39.686
I used to do that kind of thing
with Dietrich.

34:39.729 --> 34:41.775
What are you,
a renaissance man?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.951
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, a-actually, I, uh --

34:43.994 --> 34:47.302
I dug up a little bit
on your family history, too.

34:47.346 --> 34:49.522
- What?
- Well, Dietrich's nothing if he ain't diligent.

34:49.565 --> 34:51.306
- What did you find?
- You really want to know?

34:51.350 --> 34:52.829
Yeah,
bring it on.

34:52.873 --> 34:55.180
Well, okay,
look, no offense. Ugh.

34:55.223 --> 34:57.138
But your father,
he, uh --

34:57.182 --> 34:58.835
he doesn't have
the best track record

34:58.879 --> 35:00.228
when it comes
to women.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.621
Yeah, he had, uh,

35:01.664 --> 35:03.971
Tammy the bartender
at the Jamaican resort.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.974
He had, uh,
a law clerk in Alberta.

35:07.017 --> 35:09.977
He had that girlfriend
in Seattle,

35:10.020 --> 35:12.632
uh, K-Kathy --
Kate.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.416
Uh,
she's a nail technician.

35:14.460 --> 35:17.376
Waitress?
Uh, yeah, waitress,
that's right.

35:17.419 --> 35:19.334
I remember her.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.162
She was perky.

35:22.772 --> 35:25.645
Yeah,
they always are.

35:25.688 --> 35:28.343
Hey,
if this new one

35:28.387 --> 35:30.171
goes the same way
the other one did,

35:30.215 --> 35:32.608
your problem's solved.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.349
Why?
What happened to her?

35:34.393 --> 35:36.308
Ren.
Yeah?

35:36.351 --> 35:38.614
We got a problem.

35:53.412 --> 35:56.110
This one is continuing to be
a problem.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.329
She's got
a hero complex.

36:01.246 --> 36:04.031
Can I help you,
Officer?

36:04.074 --> 36:05.206
Jenny: You just
killed a kid.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.425
What happened?

36:06.468 --> 36:08.601
A kid by the name
of Mason Ford died

36:08.644 --> 36:10.255
with your drugs
on him.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.692
Synthetic fentanyl,
laced with whatever filth

36:12.735 --> 36:14.128
that you're
cutting your batch with.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.912
I just
want you to know

36:15.956 --> 36:18.611
that I will not stop
until you go down.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.308
I'm sorry.

36:20.352 --> 36:21.614
I just
want to understand.

36:21.657 --> 36:25.400
You think <i>I</i> sold drugs
to some kid,

36:25.444 --> 36:27.054
and the kid
is dead?

36:27.097 --> 36:28.708
That kid
had a name.

36:30.100 --> 36:32.015
Are we doing this?

36:32.059 --> 36:34.322
No, we're not,
'cause if I remember correctly,

36:34.366 --> 36:37.238
you need a warrant to be
on private property.
Which you're standing on.

36:37.282 --> 36:38.283
So why don't you just
turn around, get out of here?

36:38.326 --> 36:39.719
'Cause you ain't gonna
do nothing.

36:44.854 --> 36:48.249
I'll see you all
very soon.

36:56.518 --> 36:59.086
Either of you
know about this?
No.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.740
I didn't come all this way
to push tainted product.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.437
You better find out
what she's talking about.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.526
I'll corner
some street-level players,

37:04.570 --> 37:06.441
see who
knows something.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.443
You have my permission
to not play nice.

37:08.487 --> 37:10.358
Hey, keep your ear
to the ground.

37:10.402 --> 37:12.926
Find out
who's messing with my product,

37:12.969 --> 37:14.493
and you do
what you do best.

38:34.660 --> 38:39.752
Hey, I hope me showing up early
is a-a happy surprise.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.406
I-I texted
but no answer.

38:41.449 --> 38:42.929
Aw, sorry.

38:42.972 --> 38:44.583
Yeah,
I've been on a tech break.

38:44.626 --> 38:47.368
Oh.
Surprise is nice sometimes.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.199
Cheers.
Cheers.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.595
So?

38:56.638 --> 38:59.380
How are you?

38:59.424 --> 39:01.600
I'm okay.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.993
Not sure if you're supposed to
feel a burden lift

39:04.037 --> 39:06.431
when a parent dies, but...

39:06.474 --> 39:08.041
here we are.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.439
You were right,
y'know.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.266
About going home.

39:17.616 --> 39:19.792
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.055
I didn't do anything.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.796
It was all you.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.275
Mm.

39:25.319 --> 39:27.147
How was it?

39:29.715 --> 39:32.457
Mm.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.765
She was angry
when she died.

39:36.809 --> 39:39.725
I was so mad
at her.

39:41.074 --> 39:43.642
'Cause I didn't get to say
all the things I wanted to say.

39:46.688 --> 39:49.299
Because she was sick

39:49.343 --> 39:52.477
and in the end,
it didn't matter.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.003
Wasn't gonna change
anything that happened.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.662
Give it time.

40:03.705 --> 40:06.012
The anger...

40:06.055 --> 40:08.318
It lets go
after a while.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.321
I promise.

40:11.365 --> 40:13.280
Yeah.

40:17.719 --> 40:21.331
Have you, uh --
Have you spoken to Cassie?

40:22.681 --> 40:24.291
I've -- I've tried
calling, but --

40:24.334 --> 40:26.685
Yeah,
I think she's content

40:26.728 --> 40:28.556
to stay off the grid
for now.

40:29.688 --> 40:31.646
Look, um...

40:31.690 --> 40:34.475
About Cassie.

40:34.519 --> 40:35.955
There's something
I've been wanting

40:35.998 --> 40:37.478
to talk
with you about.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.524
Something happened
while I was gone?

40:39.567 --> 40:41.743
Kind of took me
by surprise,

40:41.787 --> 40:43.179
to be honest.

40:44.746 --> 40:47.488
I'm just surprised
it took this long.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.404
I've seen the way
you two dance around each other.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.715
I missed you, Jerrie.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.978
Okay.

40:59.021 --> 41:01.633
So where
does that leave us?

42:13.661 --> 42:15.663
Bad move.

42:23.758 --> 42:27.588
