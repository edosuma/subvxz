00:13.881 --> 00:14.480

00:14.482 --> 00:15.314
>> DEE: I mean, I have a

00:15.316 --> 00:15.981
boyfriend.

00:15.983 --> 00:16.815
Is it that hard to believe?

00:16.817 --> 00:17.449
I got a boyfriend.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.217
His name's Ryan.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.118
>> FRANK: How the hell did you

00:19.120 --> 00:19.785
get a boyfriend?

00:19.787 --> 00:20.686
>> I met him on Bunchers.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.620
>> Right, right, so you went on

00:21.622 --> 00:22.554
a group date with a bunch of

00:22.556 --> 00:23.522
ugly chicks to make yourself

00:23.524 --> 00:24.490
look good, and you tricked a

00:24.492 --> 00:25.724
guy.

00:25.726 --> 00:26.692
>> Yes, of course, that's

00:26.694 --> 00:27.693
exactly what I did, and it

00:27.695 --> 00:29.128
worked well, and-and now we're

00:29.130 --> 00:30.329
going steady.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.563
>> CHARLIE: That's a good trick.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.564
>> Bunchers-- sounds like the

00:32.566 --> 00:33.365
'70s.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.366
Bunch of people would get

00:34.368 --> 00:35.334
together.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.301
The next thing you know, it was

00:36.303 --> 00:37.302
all asses and hands and tits

00:37.304 --> 00:38.504
and...

00:38.506 --> 00:39.505
I could slip right in and out

00:39.507 --> 00:40.506
without anybody noticing.

00:40.508 --> 00:41.707
It was great.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.674
>> I can definitely brush up on

00:42.676 --> 00:43.876
my game.

00:43.878 --> 00:45.244
I don't know if you guys noticed

00:45.246 --> 00:46.545
this, but, like, I'm kind of

00:46.547 --> 00:48.080
having a hard time closing the

00:48.082 --> 00:49.715
deal with the waitress.

00:49.717 --> 00:50.983
>> Is he...?

00:50.985 --> 00:51.817
>> Yeah, we've noticed.

00:51.819 --> 00:52.885
>> So, maybe I can go on, like,

00:52.887 --> 00:54.153
some group dates with you, and

00:54.155 --> 00:55.220
you can show me some skills, and

00:55.222 --> 00:56.321
I can figure out the final move

00:56.323 --> 00:57.423
that I need to, you know...

00:57.425 --> 00:58.924
Oh, and let's do 'em at Paddy's.

00:58.926 --> 00:59.925
We could make a bunch of money.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.326
>> It's a good idea.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.327
>> MAC: That's a great idea.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.429
>> We can make a bunch of money.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.263
I'll tell you what.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.164
As an erotic man, I have been

01:05.166 --> 01:06.065
keeping my eye on this Bunchers

01:06.067 --> 01:07.066
situation, and I got to say--

01:07.068 --> 01:08.333
I'm into it.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.401
So, I'll tell you what.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.436
I will take you two under my

01:10.438 --> 01:11.437
wing, and show you the DENNIS

01:11.439 --> 01:12.604

01:12.606 --> 01:14.273
>> Oh.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.541

01:15.543 --> 01:16.575
I'm all tied down, so I can't

01:16.577 --> 01:17.876
participate, but, uh, I think

01:17.878 --> 01:19.511
it'd be great to jump in on this

01:19.513 --> 01:20.612
trend.

DENNIS system.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.599
See, the girls will see the

02:13.601 --> 02:15.134
leash, and I'll say, "I've got a

02:15.136 --> 02:16.969
rescue dog outside," thereby,

02:16.971 --> 02:18.403
"D," demonstrating my value as a

02:18.405 --> 02:19.505
compassionate man.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.906
Later, when we go outside, the

02:20.908 --> 02:22.174
dog will be missing.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.342
I'll become hysterical and

02:23.344 --> 02:24.309
suggest that, maybe, the dog ran

02:24.311 --> 02:25.344
back to the apartment.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.678
And then we'll go back to the

apartment.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.647
The dog won't be there, either,

02:28.649 --> 02:29.781
and the girl will console me.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.949
With sex.

02:33.787 --> 02:34.620
>> He let it go.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.521
It probably got obliterated by a

02:35.523 --> 02:36.355
taxi or something.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.256

05:33.033 --> 05:33.965
You were supposed to want that,

05:33.967 --> 05:34.833
because he was supposed to tell

05:43.210 --> 05:44.109

05:44.111 --> 05:44.943
>> And there is no dog.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.812

>> Yeah. Oh, creatine is a

an inside knowledge of the

09:10.918 --> 09:11.550

09:11.552 --> 09:12.484

it.

Are you, are you rating me?

10:41.842 --> 10:42.807

10:42.809 --> 10:44.009
No, I'm just checking my phone.

10:53.854 --> 10:54.686
stupid.

10:54.687 --> 10:55.519

10:55.522 --> 10:56.321
five.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.155

10:57.157 --> 10:58.089

10:58.925 --> 11:00.425

11:00.427 --> 11:01.693

11:27.788 --> 11:28.887

11:28.889 --> 11:29.788

11:29.790 --> 11:30.555

11:30.556 --> 11:31.321

11:33.493 --> 11:35.060
I think we're gonna go.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.194
>> Okay, fine.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.162
Well, then, I don't want you to

11:37.164 --> 11:38.029

11:38.031 --> 11:38.997
That's not what I want anymore.

11:38.999 --> 11:39.964

11:55.182 --> 11:56.314
What else is there?

11:56.316 --> 11:57.849
>> Uh, can you put "Jews" in the

11:57.851 --> 11:58.650
"yes" column?

11:58.652 --> 11:59.401
>> What?

11:59.402 --> 12:00.151
>> I feel like we gotta get it

12:00.153 --> 12:00.919
out in the open.

12:00.920 --> 12:01.686
>> Would you leave the Jews out

12:01.688 --> 12:02.520
of it?

12:02.522 --> 12:03.388
>> No, because they have their

12:03.390 --> 12:04.556
"J" sites 'cause they don't want

12:04.558 --> 12:05.390
to be with us as much as we

12:05.392 --> 12:06.324
don't want to be with them.

12:09.196 --> 12:10.328

12:10.330 --> 12:11.262

12:15.435 --> 12:16.501
>> Let's switch gears and go to

12:16.503 --> 12:17.335
the joke.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.537
>> Yeah.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.738

12:19.740 --> 12:20.872

20:28.528 --> 20:29.760
Bullshit! Rate-- zero!

20:29.762 --> 20:31.028

20:45.712 --> 20:46.777
I think it's because we haven't

20:46.779 --> 20:48.045
really been tending bar.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.046
>> Well, there's still a bunch

20:49.048 --> 20:50.081
of dudes here.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.048
>> Yeah, there's a bunch of

20:51.050 --> 20:52.116

Deed-- the most empowered

20:54.087 --> 20:55.086

20:55.088 --> 20:56.087
>> They all do seem to be into

20:56.089 --> 20:57.088
her.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.122
>> Hey, Dee.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.123
>> You again? Listen.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.124
I'm not gonna change your

21:00.126 --> 21:01.125
rating, okay?

21:01.127 --> 21:02.093
Just be grateful for the time

21:02.095 --> 21:03.094
that we had together and

21:03.096 --> 21:04.128
beat it.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.129
>> Actually I was hoping to

21:05.131 --> 21:06.097
hang out again.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.098
>> Yeah? I bet you do.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.099
It's 'cause I gave you one

21:08.101 --> 21:09.100
star-- I played you.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.134
>> I don't need stars.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.102
I was just hoping to get laid

21:11.104 --> 21:12.103
again.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.137
>> What?

21:13.139 --> 21:14.138
>> Hey, Dee, any chance I could

21:14.140 --> 21:16.073
get Deed again?

21:16.075 --> 21:17.541
>> No, you're upset.

21:17.543 --> 21:19.210
Aren't you upset?

21:19.212 --> 21:20.211
You're upset about the zero

21:20.213 --> 21:21.379
rating I gave you.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.780
>> No. You could rate me lower

21:22.782 --> 21:24.115
if you like.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.116
>> Hey, are you the whore who

21:25.118 --> 21:26.450
bangs everybody?

21:26.452 --> 21:27.451
>> No, I'm not the whore...

21:27.453 --> 21:28.719
I-I'm the empowered woman who

21:28.721 --> 21:30.321
gives poor ratings to men.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.389
>> Yeah, sure.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.456
Can I get a rating?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.591
>> No! Why would you want that

21:33.593 --> 21:34.558
from me? What's going on?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.593
Get out of here!

21:35.595 --> 21:36.560
All three of you!

21:36.562 --> 21:37.561
Get out of here!

21:38.598 --> 21:39.597
Go, go, go, go. Go.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.931

21:40.933 --> 21:41.966
Okay, I think I know what's

21:41.968 --> 21:43.067
happening here.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.101
Guys?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.236
We've lost sight of what's truly

21:45.238 --> 21:47.071
important.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.173
You can't derive your self-worth

21:49.175 --> 21:50.975
from the opinions of others.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.777
No! No, you get your self-worth

21:52.779 --> 21:54.445
from when you convince yourself

21:54.447 --> 21:56.447
that you're tough and that

21:56.449 --> 21:57.648
you're straight.

21:57.650 --> 21:58.983
>> I am tough.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.818
>> Sure, yes, absolutely.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.920
Or-or that you have got a shot

22:02.922 --> 22:03.954
with a woman who we've all

22:03.956 --> 22:05.122
banged but who hates you.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.290
>> Right. You're saying that I'm

22:06.292 --> 22:07.291
getting closer.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.292
Nice. I got a shot.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.293
>> Yeah, you're getting close,

22:09.295 --> 22:10.294
buddy. You'll get there.

22:10.296 --> 22:12.363
Or you-- that your penis could

22:12.365 --> 22:13.464
ever possibly remain erect for

22:13.466 --> 22:14.765
more than a couple of seconds,

22:14.767 --> 22:16.200
even with a cock ring on.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.368
>> Hmm.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.436
>> Or that you are a powerful

22:18.438 --> 22:19.804
woman...

22:19.806 --> 22:20.938
instead of a dirty, dirty

22:20.940 --> 22:23.841
whore... who bangs toad people.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.142
Yeah, guys, guys, guys.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.644
Your true power comes not from

22:26.646 --> 22:27.878
outside sources, but from the

22:27.880 --> 22:29.313
delusional stories that you all

22:29.315 --> 22:31.515
convince yourselves of.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.384
And no one, no one can take that

22:33.386 --> 22:36.120
away from you.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.789
>> Wow.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.124
And what about you?

22:40.126 --> 22:41.058
>> Me? What about me?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.226
I'm good, man.

22:42.228 --> 22:43.294
I-I've been doing great.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.295
Yeah, this whole thing's been

22:44.297 --> 22:45.229
great for me.

22:45.231 --> 22:46.464
>> Well, that's good because

22:46.466 --> 22:47.565
you're down to zero stars.

22:47.567 --> 22:48.566
>> Oh, is he?

22:48.568 --> 22:49.834
>> Yeah, down to zero.

22:49.836 --> 22:50.868
>> I don't give a shit about

22:50.870 --> 22:51.869
that, you know what I mean?

22:51.871 --> 22:52.837
The star rating thing is not...

22:52.839 --> 22:53.838
(stammers)

22:53.840 --> 22:54.839
Can I see that for a second?

22:54.841 --> 22:55.873
>> Yeah.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.841
>> Let me see that, yeah.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.409
(groans)

22:58.411 --> 23:00.044
Yeah, you know... Goddamn it!

23:00.046 --> 23:02.012
Goddamn it! You son of a bitch!
