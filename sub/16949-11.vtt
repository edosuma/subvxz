{\an8}(Ray J)
Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

00:05.839 --> 00:07.674
{\an7}You know, I've been trying
to play the family card

00:07.741 --> 00:09.275
{\an7}and just be cool,
but it's just like,

00:09.342 --> 00:10.377
{\an7}I realized
it was too much

00:10.443 --> 00:12.011
{\an7}and it just really
needed to stop.

00:12.078 --> 00:13.947
{\an7}If you need me to hit Jason up,
I'll hit Jason up.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.115
{\an8}I got Jason number.

00:14.013 --> 00:15.115
{\an8}Okay.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.516
{\an8}Yup.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.818
{\an8}If I have to go through
you to get to the tape,

00:18.885 --> 00:20.353
{\an8}that's the ultimate goal.

00:20.420 --> 00:21.554
{\an8}Who's in the tape, bro?

00:21.621 --> 00:22.622
{\an8}He's a rapper.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.957
{\an8}A known rapper?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.327
{\an8}You're not gonna sit here
and talk about my mom.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.629
{\an8}I'm sick of it.

00:27.394 --> 00:29.629
{\an7}And that's why her lips
are (bleep) up.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.765
{\an8}Yo.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.765
{\an9}(bleep).

00:31.831 --> 00:33.666
{\an8}Don't (bleep) talk
about my mom, (bleep).

00:33.733 --> 00:35.568
{\an8}You want to step to me,
I'm gonna show your ass

00:35.635 --> 00:37.270
{\an8}who's the kid.

00:37.337 --> 00:38.671
{\an8}(woman)
You were in jail?

00:38.738 --> 00:40.507
{\an7}(woman)
Yeah, the citizen's arrest.

00:40.573 --> 00:43.710
{\an8}I could be in jail for
30 days to six months.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.613
{\an7}(Ray J)
I had this prenup
in my hand,

00:46.679 --> 00:48.415
{\an7}and I'm gonna just
rip the whole thing up.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.649
{\an8}(crowd cheering)

00:49.716 --> 00:51.518
{\an8}I want to be able
to say this because

00:51.584 --> 00:53.153
{\an8}I'm not necessarily in
agreement with you

00:53.219 --> 00:54.254
{\an8}being married.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.822
{\an8}Hello.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.090
{\an8}(Princess)
Your mom already said
she didn't want us

00:57.157 --> 00:58.458
{\an8}to get married.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.427
{\an7}And then you got me up here
coming up to this?

01:00.493 --> 01:02.061
{\an7}Your attitude,
I don't like it.

01:02.128 --> 01:04.030
{\an8}Anything else?

01:02.128 --> 01:04.030
{\an8}Be yourself.

01:04.096 --> 01:05.230
{\an8}Be <i> yourself.</i>

01:05.298 --> 01:06.599
{\an7}I'm about to be
in a minute.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.703
{\an8}(woman)
I'm here to introduce to you
the face of Ace.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.205
{\an8}(crowd cheering)

01:12.272 --> 01:13.406
{\an8}Isn't it Miss Boomerang?

01:13.473 --> 01:14.741
{\an8}I just threw her out
and she came back.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.009
{\an8}First of all, pause.

01:16.075 --> 01:17.210
{\an8}Why'd you see your way
back in the club--

01:17.277 --> 01:19.245
{\an7}I don't see what me
and Teairra

01:19.312 --> 01:20.914
{\an7}have anything
to do with you.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.482
{\an8}You're mad about a (bleep)

01:22.549 --> 01:24.417
{\an7}she don't want, I don't want,
and don't want you.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.885
{\an7}Shut the (bleep) up,
bitch!

01:25.952 --> 01:27.086
{\an8}You watch
your (bleep) mouth.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.590
{\an8}(bleep) raggedy-ass
(bleep).

01:30.657 --> 01:31.858
{\an8}Okay, that's an outfit.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.560
{\an8}Like it rejected
the rest of your face.

01:33.626 --> 01:34.861
{\an8}My nose is real.

01:34.928 --> 01:35.862
{\an8}All right, boo.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.263
{\an7}I got a Jewish nose,
baby.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.932
{\an8}It's called money.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.932
{\an8}No, bitch,
you got a (bleep) snout.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.200
{\an8}Goodbye, honey.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.468

{\an8}(Ray J)
Things have not been the same,
all right?

02:17.036 --> 02:19.205
{\an8}Me and Princess, we about
to get married in two weeks.

02:19.272 --> 02:20.573
{\an8}And we are drifting apart.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.509
{\an8}I mean, (bleep) ain't been
the same since she heard

02:22.575 --> 02:24.577
{\an8}my mama saying that she didn't
want us to get married.

02:24.644 --> 02:28.214
And we got into it
at my video shoot last week.

02:28.281 --> 02:29.916
This (bleep) all messed up.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.118
We gotta do
what we gotta do

02:32.185 --> 02:35.188
to make sure this wedding
is going through.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.656
I got some things I need to
discuss with you, all right?

02:36.723 --> 02:39.292
{\an1}Hold on, let me take
the gold rope off real quick

02:39.359 --> 02:40.326
'cause it's dangling.

02:40.393 --> 02:41.794
And I don't want
to mess it up

02:41.861 --> 02:43.429
and let it break,
you know what I'm saying?

02:43.496 --> 02:44.697
{\an3}Thank you.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.733
{\an1}Just go ahead and sit that--
put that in a safe.

02:46.799 --> 02:49.802
I said I wanted
a "Coming to America"

02:49.869 --> 02:53.206
flashback extravaganza,
and I'm gonna get it.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.341
{\an8}And you know what's even
more special?

02:55.408 --> 02:57.010
{\an8}I got my pops here with me.

02:57.076 --> 02:58.378
And this is just
one of those moments

02:58.444 --> 03:00.146
that you will just never forget.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.648
{\an5}Aced it, my brother.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.648
See you soon.

03:01.714 --> 03:02.749
{\an6}Aced it.

03:01.714 --> 03:02.749
All right.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.217
{\an5}Good job, guys.

03:02.815 --> 03:04.217
I appreciate it.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.752
{\an5}Talk to you soon, Dad.

03:04.284 --> 03:05.752
{\an3}You know?

03:05.818 --> 03:07.921
{\an1}Yeah, Pops, I want to come out
with that "ooh-wop."

03:07.987 --> 03:08.988
You know what I'm saying?

03:09.055 --> 03:10.690
So this is it, huh, Ray?

03:10.757 --> 03:12.058
{\an3}(bleep).

03:12.125 --> 03:13.493
It might be, Pops.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.794
Might not be.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.130
It's so mother(bleep)
stressful right now.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.932
I can't go to Mom's
and talk about it

03:18.998 --> 03:21.334
'cause Mom's gonna say,
"I told you, shh, don't do it!

03:21.401 --> 03:23.336
Just-- just-- just get out
of it now," right?

03:23.403 --> 03:25.004
So I gotta holler at my dad.

03:25.071 --> 03:28.007
I know Princess and I are
way stronger

03:28.074 --> 03:30.143
than what we're
going through right now.

03:30.209 --> 03:33.012
I just want her to be able
to understand like, look,

03:33.079 --> 03:34.380
we getting married.

03:34.447 --> 03:35.848
I don't care
what I used to do.

03:35.915 --> 03:37.684
I don't do that no more.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.285
And she know that.

03:39.352 --> 03:42.155
{\an1}So now that we together,
when we arguing, it's like,

03:42.221 --> 03:43.856
I'm shooting a video.

03:43.923 --> 03:45.992
Can I still be
creative

03:46.059 --> 03:49.162
without you thinking
that I'm up to something?

03:49.228 --> 03:50.430
What am I doing wrong?

03:50.496 --> 03:51.931
{\an1}You're not
doing nothing wrong.

03:51.998 --> 03:55.735
{\an1}When you find this person
that you really think

03:55.802 --> 03:57.570
{\an1}you want to spend
the rest of your life with,

03:57.637 --> 04:00.873
{\an1}you got to feel that divorce
is not an option.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.076
It's Princess forever.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.545
You guys gonna have
to just make it work

04:05.612 --> 04:06.946
and work together.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.349
{\an4}Everybody got
a different personality.

04:07.013 --> 04:09.349
Yeah.

04:09.415 --> 04:11.884
{\an1}But you'll work it out,
I'm sure,

04:11.951 --> 04:13.152
{\an1}because I believe
you love her

04:13.219 --> 04:14.520
and I believe
she loves you.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.522
(Ray J)
You know, my pops is right.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.324
I knew Princess was
the one for me

04:18.391 --> 04:20.259
when I got down
on that one knee.

04:20.326 --> 04:22.762
All the (bleep) we going through
was just wedding jitters.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.063
That's all it is.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.932
You the only one
I can talk to about this.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.467
I can't talk to Mom.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.836
'Cause the minute I say,
"I'm having a problem--"

04:29.902 --> 04:30.837
"Don't do it.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.205
Cut the wedding."

04:32.271 --> 04:34.374
{\an1}You know, when I told her
y'all having a few problems,

04:34.440 --> 04:37.210
{\an1}she just say, "They're having
a few problems!

04:37.276 --> 04:38.711
They're having problems!"

04:38.778 --> 04:41.781
Just trying to be patient
and just try to listen.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.816
All these problems I'm having
with Princess

04:43.883 --> 04:46.352
will probably have my mama
doing the happy dance right now.

04:46.419 --> 04:49.422
But I'm gonna take my pop's
advice and calm down

04:49.489 --> 04:52.892
and remember that
I'm gonna love Princess forever.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.427
You are you.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.763
{\an1}She is
who she is.

04:56.829 --> 04:58.698
{\an1}And you guys are gonna
put it together

04:58.765 --> 05:00.667
{\an1}and y'all gonna
make gravy, dude.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.369
{\an1}And maybe I might get a grandson
or a granddaughter

05:03.436 --> 05:05.371
out of this whole situation.

05:05.438 --> 05:06.639
{\an1}You guys are gonna
do good.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.207
I still gotta
figure it out, Pop.

05:08.274 --> 05:10.276
Love you, son.

05:10.343 --> 05:11.411
Love you, too.

05:12.712 --> 05:15.748
♪♪

05:22.255 --> 05:23.556
{\an8}Hey, how you doing?

05:22.255 --> 05:23.556
{\an8}How are you?

05:23.623 --> 05:24.791
{\an8}All right.

05:24.857 --> 05:26.526
{\an8}When I thought about it,
I was really wrong

05:26.592 --> 05:28.528
{\an8}for the things that
I said to Pam the other day.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.363
{\an8}I'm not gonna lie,
I do see now

05:30.430 --> 05:33.366
{\an8}how my mom has definitely been
adding some fuel to the fire

05:33.433 --> 05:36.536
and has played a role in
the arguments with Pam and A1.

05:36.602 --> 05:37.970
But that's not my fight anymore.

05:38.037 --> 05:40.339
At this point, I plan to build
a new relationship

05:40.406 --> 05:42.942
with my mother-in-law,
and hopefully from there,

05:43.009 --> 05:45.978
my mom will see that Pam's not
that bad of a person.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.114
{\an5}I feel so bad
about the other day.

05:46.045 --> 05:48.114
Mm-hmm.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.717
And I wanted to apologize
for my part

05:50.783 --> 05:51.951
in the things
that I said.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.519
You are my mother-in-law.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.921
No matter what, we should
have a good relationship.

05:54.987 --> 05:57.523
I should never call you
out of your name.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.292
I should never
like raise my voice

05:59.358 --> 06:00.426
{\an5}or anything like that.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.426
Right.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.994
And I love you,
of course.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.629
That was just
like way overboard

06:03.696 --> 06:04.731
and I've been feeling
horrible.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.100
So I do want to
say I'm sorry first.

06:07.166 --> 06:08.668
{\an1}It's not you,
it's your mother.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.705
{\an1}I'm trying now to have
a relationship,

06:12.772 --> 06:14.974
{\an1}but your mom
is kinda hard.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.009
{\an1}Your mother had y'all
car towed?

06:17.076 --> 06:18.945
Yeah, she did.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.046
{\an1}That's--
come on now.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.682
{\an1}Your mother should start
respecting A1

06:22.749 --> 06:24.851
{\an1}'cause he's
a good man to you.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.053
{\an1}I don't like the way
she treats you,

06:27.120 --> 06:28.821
whether you know it or not.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.223
She treats me fine.

06:30.289 --> 06:31.891
{\an1}Well, sometimes
she don't treat you right.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.726
I mean, you're mother
and daughter, you argue.

06:33.793 --> 06:35.762
{\an1}When she does what she does,
it hurts me.

06:35.828 --> 06:37.296
You just don't know it.

06:37.363 --> 06:39.632
(Pam)
Lyrica G is threatened by anyone

06:39.699 --> 06:41.801
{\an8}who shares a close bond
with Lyrica.

06:41.868 --> 06:44.070
{\an8}Her mother always
tries to run her life.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.306
But I think she really getting
fed up with the situation.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.741
This is crazy.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.309
{\an1}At the end of the day,
this is the stupidest thing

06:50.376 --> 06:51.844
that's never gonna
get us anywhere.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.313
{\an1}She told me that she's gonna
give me the car back.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.849
{\an1}And I was thinking, maybe
like you could ride with me

06:56.916 --> 06:58.951
to go do the trade-off
with the cars,

06:59.018 --> 07:01.521
and maybe that'll be
a first step of her seeing

07:01.587 --> 07:03.823
{\an5}that me and you
are bonding again.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.823
Right.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.092
And maybe
I would just love

07:06.159 --> 07:08.027
{\an5}if you and her had a...

07:06.159 --> 07:08.027
{\an1}Right.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.162
... you know,
some sort of bond.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.263
{\an1}But it starts with
me and you.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.232
{\an1}I love my son,
so I want his happiness.

07:13.299 --> 07:14.734
{\an5}You understand?

07:13.299 --> 07:14.734
But do you forgive me?

07:14.801 --> 07:16.736
{\an1}Oh, girl, I never
was mad at you.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.938
Okay, but I love you
and I, once again,

07:19.005 --> 07:20.339
I'm so sorry.

07:20.406 --> 07:23.176
And let's go get the cars
and hopefully just...

07:23.242 --> 07:25.111
try to be a little
smooth sailing from there.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.046
{\an3}Hooray.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.048
♪♪

07:42.595 --> 07:44.931
{\an5}(Hazel E)
That's right,
it's your girl Hazel E, baby.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.599
{\an8}And I'm back
in this bitch.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.733
{\an8}(laughing)

07:47.800 --> 07:49.368
{\an8}I've been living my life
to the fullest.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.572
I got a poppin' new record,
your girl's lit,

07:52.638 --> 07:54.307
and I don't know
if these hos is ready for me.

07:54.373 --> 07:56.909
I'm gonna link up
with my girl TT,

07:56.976 --> 07:58.611
have a couple
drinks, reminisce.

07:58.678 --> 08:01.113
I mean, hell, we've been friends
for over 10 years,

08:01.180 --> 08:03.916
and at this point, even though
we have our ups and downs,

08:03.983 --> 08:05.518
one thing's
for sure is we know how

08:05.585 --> 08:08.187
to lay that (bleep) to rest
and keep it pushin'.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.789
We gotta hang out
more, bitch.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.592
{\an1}Yeah, we do, I mean,
you don't get friendships

08:12.658 --> 08:14.327
{\an1}that last 10 years
in Hollywood.

08:14.393 --> 08:17.897
{\an1}It's a true,
honest, real--

08:17.964 --> 08:21.601
{\an5}Sisterhood, yeah.

08:17.964 --> 08:21.601
{\an1}Like you can always say,
Hazel's got my back.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.403
Remember when you came
in my house

08:24.470 --> 08:26.339
and poured out
all my Jack Daniel's

08:26.405 --> 08:27.907
{\an5}and put Coke in it?

08:26.405 --> 08:27.907
Yeah, I had to

08:27.974 --> 08:29.275
{\an1}because that was
my first time

08:29.342 --> 08:31.978
{\an1}even realizing like,
oh, she likes to take it there.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.279
{\an1}That's what
a real friend would do.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.648
And the thing is,
the gag is,

08:35.715 --> 08:36.948
that I was so (bleep) up

08:37.015 --> 08:38.985
that I didn't even realize
that it was Coke

08:39.051 --> 08:40.385
that I was drinking.

08:40.453 --> 08:42.020
We growed up, you know.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.389
{\an5}It's memories.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.389
Yeah, it is.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.025
Honestly,
sometimes Teairra likes

08:46.092 --> 08:48.361
to go overboard
with the liquor.

08:48.427 --> 08:51.163
To me, it seems like some things
really never change.

08:51.230 --> 08:54.166
Her ass is still on these
streets stirring up trouble.

08:54.233 --> 08:57.169
All these headlines of her going
ham on this Uber driver

08:57.236 --> 08:58.571
has flooded the Internet.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.307
And honestly, I need a moment
to catch this "T."

09:01.374 --> 09:03.542
{\an4}What's poppin'
with you?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.542
{\an3}Girl...

09:03.609 --> 09:05.211
I need to get caught up
to speed on the court--

09:05.278 --> 09:06.345
{\an3}This whole
(bleeps).

09:06.412 --> 09:08.981
{\an5}Teairra versus the People.

09:06.412 --> 09:08.981
{\an3}Yes, baby.

09:09.048 --> 09:12.218
(both laughing)

09:12.285 --> 09:14.387
{\an1}Teairra versus the People,
let's get it bracket--

09:14.453 --> 09:16.355
Teairra versus
the People, yes.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.158
I have to make
an appearance.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.727
And, you know, my attorneys--
I think I have good attorneys.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.462
{\an5}Just go an state your case.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.462
Go state my case.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.398
{\an5}The right people--

09:23.529 --> 09:25.398
State the proof.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.066
{\an4}You know what I'm saying,
walking you in.

09:25.464 --> 09:27.066
Yes.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.200
Stating the facts.

09:28.267 --> 09:30.636
And I feel like
I have proof

09:30.703 --> 09:32.538
{\an5}that I'm not guilty.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.538
{\an1}Right.

09:32.605 --> 09:33.839
You know what I'm saying?

09:33.906 --> 09:35.641
I think that everything
is gonna be okay.

09:35.708 --> 09:38.878
It's so stupid that I even have
to still deal with this case.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.013
But I know that
I didn't do anything wrong

09:41.080 --> 09:42.448
and I'm gonna get through this.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.583
My attorney's gonna take care
of everything.

09:44.650 --> 09:45.751
Enough about me.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.019
What's going on
with you?

09:47.086 --> 09:48.688
{\an1}Yeah, I mean,
you know,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.290
{\an1}I just dropped a single
with Fetty on it, you know?

09:51.357 --> 09:52.825
Well, he's hot right now,

09:52.892 --> 09:54.493
but he's also Masika's
baby daddy.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.696
{\an5}Yeah, allegedly or...

09:54.560 --> 09:56.696
How is that working out?

09:56.762 --> 09:58.497
I don't know if you've
been paying attention

09:58.564 --> 09:59.999
to social media, but...

10:00.066 --> 10:02.234
Uh-huh, I saw everything.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.503
She was saying that it wasn't
Fetty that was on the record.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.272
{\an5}It's Fetty on the--

10:04.570 --> 10:06.272
Do you know for sure, though?

10:06.339 --> 10:08.107
{\an1}I do know for sure
it's Fetty on the record.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.576
But I'm like, well, how you
know Fetty your baby daddy?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.912
Listen, I don't know
if this is Fetty Wap

10:12.979 --> 10:14.380
or Fetty Bop or Fetty Not.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.915
I don't know
who the (bleep) it is.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.783
I known Hazel longer.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.385
Hazel introduced me
to Masika.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.454
Now y'all fighting,
now I'm supposed to pick a side.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.022
Bitches, leave me out of it.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.557
{\an1}I don't understand that girl
and her spirit.

10:24.623 --> 10:26.892
She should just be proud
of her accomplishments.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.928
She has joined
the elite club

10:28.995 --> 10:32.231
of Fetty Wap's concubine

10:32.298 --> 10:35.134
{\an1}and all the women
that carry his children,

10:35.201 --> 10:36.969
{\an5}perhaps or not.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.969
Damn.

10:37.036 --> 10:39.205
Listen, I forgot all about
this bitch

10:39.271 --> 10:41.173
until she popped up
on my Twitter account

10:41.240 --> 10:43.442
claiming that that's not
Fetty Wap on my track.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.311
I'm 100% sure of it.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.948
Are <i> you</i> 100% sure
that that's the daddy?

10:49.015 --> 10:51.951
Just 'cause he's been there
does not mean he's the only one.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.252
Well, I'm happy
you back in town.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.553
Like what the (bleep)
are you doing?

10:54.620 --> 10:56.789
{\an5}Let's get some food.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.789
{\an1}Get dressed up,
you know--

10:56.856 --> 10:58.524
{\an5}And go out, okay, okay.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.524
Yeah, let's go.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.459
{\an1}Let's go give him
a run around the town

11:00.526 --> 11:01.694
{\an5}like we used to.

11:00.526 --> 11:01.694
{\an3}All right.

11:01.761 --> 11:02.795
Well, cheers to that.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.096
{\an5}I miss you so much.

11:02.862 --> 11:04.096
I know, baby.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.300
{\an8}I know Sonja loves you.

11:08.367 --> 11:12.371
{\an7}Little does she know,
I want the prenup for myself.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.106
{\an8}So I get to the courtroom,

11:14.173 --> 11:16.809
{\an8}I got a (bleep)
bench warrant.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.245
{\an8}You lied
and they came for me,

but to put you back

But I still can't ignore
what Ray and I

11:52.111 --> 11:53.245
have been going through lately.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.347
All of a sudden
we're fighting,

11:55.414 --> 11:58.851
and he's got this bad attitude
about everything I say or do.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.387
This is really happening,

12:01.454 --> 12:04.924
and we are part of such
a big moment, Princess.

12:04.990 --> 12:09.428
Real talk like, I mean,
Ray ripped his prenup up

12:09.495 --> 12:11.330
{\an5}at the engagement party.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.330
No, I know.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.432
The prenup came from Sonja.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.869
Oh, saying that
you guys should have one.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.271
{\an4}Yeah.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.271
But she's doing that
for both of y'all.

12:19.338 --> 12:20.573
No, she's doing it for him.

12:20.639 --> 12:23.876
I know Sonja loves you
unconditionally.

12:23.943 --> 12:26.712
It has nothing to do
with Princess and Ray.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.781
{\an1}Okay, it does have
something to do with me.

12:28.848 --> 12:29.915
She told me herself.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.918
{\an1}I walked in when
they were having lunch,

12:32.985 --> 12:34.820
and she pretty much told me

12:34.887 --> 12:36.922
{\an1}that she did not want us
to get married.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.891
{\an1}It's like
little does she know,

12:38.958 --> 12:41.026
{\an1}I want the prenup
for myself.

12:43.062 --> 12:46.565
{\an8}I thought about it,
and the prenup makes sense.

12:46.632 --> 12:48.667
{\an8}All this arguing that
we've been doing

12:48.734 --> 12:50.436
{\an8}is only
reminding me of the past.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.805
This is the first
time I've heard this.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.475
For me, I don't believe
in a prenup at all.

12:56.542 --> 12:58.944
I do need to make sure
Princess is protected.

12:59.011 --> 13:00.546
When Ray and I broke up,

13:00.613 --> 13:04.350
{\an1}he bought my trademark
to my name.

{\an1}Stuff that happens
like that when we break up,

{\an1}Bottom line,
I need to protect myself.

13:12.391 --> 13:15.261
{\an1}I'm just thankful to be
a part of such a big moment.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.364
Whatever you do, you got
my support 100%.

13:18.430 --> 13:22.501
I definitely understand
how Princess can feel that way.

13:22.568 --> 13:26.739
{\an8}But I understand Sonja
on a whole nother level.

13:26.805 --> 13:28.407
You know I'm here 'cause

13:28.474 --> 13:30.609
I just want to know
how you are doing.

13:30.676 --> 13:31.944
I'm doing okay.

13:32.011 --> 13:33.279
You don't seem okay.

Although we live far apart,

13:39.351 --> 13:41.387
we've always remained
really close.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.022
You know, at this point,

13:43.088 --> 13:45.124
{\an1}my issue isn't
with Sonja anymore.

13:45.191 --> 13:47.459
{\an1}My issue right now is
with me and Ray.

13:47.526 --> 13:50.529
I just want to make sure that
this is what he really wants,

13:50.596 --> 13:55.367
{\an1}because I'm not here
to make him choose anybody.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.003
{\an1}And I feel like the closer
to the date we are,

13:58.070 --> 14:01.407
I feel like we're just
not on the same page.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.475
It's getting close,
it's almost here.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.978
You know, you should
be happy right now.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.315
Just... kick the bull,
like it's you and him.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.584
If y'all gotta do little
things on writing on paper

14:11.650 --> 14:13.219
just to secure yourself
in the beginning,

14:13.285 --> 14:14.420
{\an5}then maybe do that.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.420
Yeah.

14:14.486 --> 14:16.355
That would make me happy.

Dominique is right.

Ray and I do need to block out
all the BS,

14:20.859 --> 14:24.597
but I still feel
like I need a prenup.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.298
I just need to make sure
I'm protected.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.200
{\an1}I need to do

14:43.782 --> 14:45.718
{\an8}but I hope she's taking it
a little bit more serious

14:45.784 --> 14:47.019
than the last time I saw her.

14:47.086 --> 14:48.921
She was drinking
and laughing

14:48.988 --> 14:50.823
and acting like
it really was no big deal,

14:50.889 --> 14:53.192
as if her lawyers was just gonna
take care of it for her.

14:53.259 --> 14:54.994
I haven't seen you
in a while, since...

14:55.060 --> 14:56.395
{\an5}Since happy hour?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.395
Even Teairra,

14:56.462 --> 14:57.630
I haven't really seen her
for a while.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.832
{\an1}Why?
She needs you in her life.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.034
{\an1}I asked her about the case
'cause that (bleep) was crazy.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.402
{\an1}I really didn't know
the whole thing would happen.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.271
{\an7}So after you heard
her whole story,

15:05.337 --> 15:07.106
{\an7}like what's your take on it,
you thought?

15:07.172 --> 15:08.974
I asked her
if she was drinking,

15:09.041 --> 15:10.909
'cause I know how her
temper can go.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.211
And she said no.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.013
I just worry about her
because, you know,

15:14.079 --> 15:15.648
I'm a little bit
concerned for her.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.782
I've been there firsthand

15:16.849 --> 15:18.250
when I've seen situations
happen

15:18.317 --> 15:20.319
with-- where we've gotten
kicked out of a restaurant

15:20.386 --> 15:21.954
{\an5}because of her temper.

15:20.386 --> 15:21.954
Yeah, you and me both.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.789
There's all times
when we all get (bleep) up

15:23.856 --> 15:24.990
{\an5}and do stupid stuff.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.990
Right, right.

15:25.057 --> 15:26.992
But when it happens
on a consistent pattern,

15:27.059 --> 15:29.128
it's like something's--
something's going on.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.462
Some people have
a chemical imbalance

15:30.529 --> 15:31.563
when they drink.

15:31.630 --> 15:32.998
My brother had a problem.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.234
You know,
and some days he was calm

15:35.301 --> 15:36.568
and some days he was crazy.

15:36.635 --> 15:38.737
And it just concerns me
'cause it's like...

15:38.804 --> 15:40.606
I already went through
a tragedy in my life,

15:40.673 --> 15:42.308
and I don't want to
see nothing happen to her.

15:42.374 --> 15:43.475
{\an1}You know, she doesn't
have family here.

15:43.542 --> 15:44.643
She doesn't have anything,

15:44.710 --> 15:46.512
{\an1}so I feel like I'm her
only support system.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.714
And I think like
it would be nice

15:48.781 --> 15:51.216
{\an1}for her other friends
to like reach out.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.551
Like I can't do this alone.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.019
Andrew's right.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.754
I think, as a friend,
it's time I really talk to her

15:55.821 --> 15:57.022
before it's too late.

15:57.089 --> 15:59.825
I can't handle
another person in my life

15:59.892 --> 16:01.360
going down this same path.

16:01.427 --> 16:03.228
{\an3}Hi, TT.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.263
{\an5}How are you guys?

16:03.295 --> 16:04.263
Hey, boo.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.764
{\an5}Good, how are you?

16:04.330 --> 16:05.764
{\an1}Hey.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.334
{\an5}What's going on?

16:05.831 --> 16:08.334
You look amazing.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.703
Had the craziest
freakin' morning.

16:10.769 --> 16:11.970
What's happened?

16:12.037 --> 16:13.238
{\an1}I had to
go to court today.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.406
{\an1}I'm shaking right now
'cause I don't know

16:14.473 --> 16:15.841
what's gonna (bleep) happen.

16:15.908 --> 16:19.645
{\an1}So there was a miscommunication
between my attorney and I,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.246
and I was late.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.048
{\an1}So I get
to the courtroom

16:23.115 --> 16:26.118
{\an1}and I got a (bleep)
bench warrant.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.455
{\an1}I'm gonna have to go
and turn myself in tomorrow.

16:29.521 --> 16:31.256
{\an1}I don't know what's
gonna happen.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.624
{\an1}I just want you to come
to court with me tomorrow.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.059
Yeah, you'll have
to show me where.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.196
I'll give you the bail money
just in case she locks me up.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.231
{\an4}'Cause a bench warrant
is serious.

16:37.262 --> 16:39.231
Right.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.366
Well, what does
your lawyer say, like--

16:40.432 --> 16:42.334
{\an1}He's telling me,
"You should be good.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.169
Just turn yourself
right in tomorrow."

16:44.236 --> 16:46.004
{\an1}But I'm gonna prepare
for the worst,

16:46.071 --> 16:47.673
so I'm gonna have
the money on deck,

16:47.740 --> 16:49.274
cash in your hand.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.177
{\an1}And if I get clink-clink,
then...

16:52.244 --> 16:53.545
Right, I got you.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.914
{\an1}I didn't think that it would
turn into this big issue.

16:55.981 --> 16:58.417
You shouldn't even be getting
yourself in these type of...

16:58.484 --> 16:59.818
{\an4}Exactly.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.818
... situations.

16:59.885 --> 17:02.388
{\an1}I can't even believe
I got into this situation.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.491
{\an8}I've been working really hard
to get my career back on track.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.260
{\an8}The court case just keeps
getting bigger and bigger.

17:08.327 --> 17:09.828
And I'm so (bleep) nervous.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.530
Like I'm scared
(bleep)less.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.898
I'm turning myself in tomorrow,

17:13.965 --> 17:16.935
and hopefully the judge
will see that I'm a good person,

17:17.002 --> 17:19.405
and I can get through
this bull(bleep).

17:19.471 --> 17:21.106
{\an1}I mean, it's a lesson,
though.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.608
{\an1}You know, like tone
your (bleep) down

17:22.674 --> 17:23.909
{\an1}and focus
on the right things.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.109
That's gonna elevate you.

17:25.176 --> 17:26.944
{\an1}Like I'm ready to look
in the mirror

17:27.012 --> 17:28.614
{\an1}and see like,
what is it, bitch?

17:28.680 --> 17:29.782
Get it together.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.621
♪♪

17:40.292 --> 17:41.660
{\an8}(Max)
After talking to Fizz,

17:41.727 --> 17:43.262
{\an8}I've finally come to
the understanding

17:43.328 --> 17:45.531
{\an8}that this beef with
Moniece is never gonna end.

17:45.597 --> 17:47.466
{\an8}We're just gonna have to be
the bigger people

17:47.533 --> 17:48.567
and set the example.

17:48.634 --> 17:49.968
At the end of the day,

17:50.035 --> 17:51.770
it's all about having
a clear conscience.

17:51.837 --> 17:54.006
That's why I had to
just tell Fizz like, look,

17:54.072 --> 17:55.507
you know I don't want
to be responsible--

17:55.574 --> 17:56.675
You told him about the tape?

17:56.742 --> 17:57.943
I had to tell him
about the tape.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.711
{\an5}Babe, why did you--

17:58.010 --> 17:59.711
I wouldn't be a real friend.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.547
{\an5}Why did you...

17:59.778 --> 18:01.547
'Cause I wouldn't be
a real friend.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.348
But he's gonna go tell her.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.416
He should tell her.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.454
I spent time with Cam
and I would hate to--

18:08.520 --> 18:10.289
him to grow up and be like

18:10.355 --> 18:13.058
that's the guy
that embarrassed my mother

18:13.125 --> 18:15.627
to the world and put out
a sex tape.

18:15.694 --> 18:16.795
You know what I'm saying?

18:16.862 --> 18:18.764
{\an1}She should learn
her (bleep) lesson.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.266
{\an1}Stop (bleep) lying on people
and thinking that

18:21.333 --> 18:24.069
{\an1}you don't gotta deal
with your real naked truth.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.737
Is that your job
to teach her her lesson,

18:25.804 --> 18:27.739
or is it our job to stay
rich and get money?

18:27.806 --> 18:29.074
She came for me.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.709
{\an1}She came for
my family.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.480
She (bleep) disrespected
my-- my whole character.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.048
I hear what you're saying,

18:36.114 --> 18:37.583
but, you know,
at the end of the day,

18:37.649 --> 18:39.785
{\an1}you need to just decide
what type of person you are.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.720
Would Beyoncé ever
release a sex tape?

18:41.787 --> 18:44.122
{\an4}Never.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.122
You know she wouldn't.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.390
Yep, you're right.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.625
{\an8}(Brandi)
Max is right.

18:46.692 --> 18:47.759
{\an8}What would Beyoncé do?

18:47.826 --> 18:50.562
{\an8}#wwbd.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.165
{\an8}My girl Be for sure
wouldn't be wasting

18:53.232 --> 18:56.201
her precious, hardworking time

18:56.268 --> 19:00.272
running around chasing
a fake chick like Moniece.

19:00.339 --> 19:03.809
I am much better than that.

19:03.876 --> 19:05.110
{\an1}(Brandi)
All I can think about is,

19:05.177 --> 19:07.246
{\an1}the wedding is around
the corner.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.448
{\an1}I can't even think
about no wedding right now.

19:09.515 --> 19:11.984
But remember when Ray
ripped up the prenup

19:12.050 --> 19:13.151
at the engagement?

19:13.218 --> 19:15.687
{\an1}When we were doing
the bridesmaids fitting,

19:15.754 --> 19:19.525
{\an1}she says that she's actually
gonna go get a prenup

19:19.591 --> 19:20.792
for herself.

19:20.859 --> 19:23.028
Ray basically doesn't know.

19:23.095 --> 19:25.664
{\an1}I kinda felt at the moment,
like oh, no.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.165
{\an1}Why are you
saying this to me?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.934
{\an1}But I do need to be
a friend to you.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.169
All you had to do
is just be a bridesmaid.

19:31.236 --> 19:33.972
Show up and smile,
catch a bouquet...

19:34.039 --> 19:35.474
eat some cake.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.010
{\an1}You don't think
I'm gonna come across

19:38.076 --> 19:40.312
disloyal to the Norwoods...

19:40.379 --> 19:41.813
{\an1}if I don't
say anything?

19:41.880 --> 19:44.683
I am so conflicted right now.

19:44.750 --> 19:48.687
I know that there's a big chance
that if I tell Ray J,

19:48.754 --> 19:51.223
she's going to be very upset.

19:51.290 --> 19:55.727
But I've known Sonja and Ray
practically my whole life.

19:55.794 --> 19:57.629
{\an1}Why would you even put
yourself in that situation?

19:57.696 --> 19:59.431
Like are you Ray's protector?

19:59.498 --> 20:01.066
{\an4}No.

19:59.498 --> 20:01.066
Are you his mentor?

20:01.133 --> 20:03.468
{\an1}No, I want
to help Princess, too.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.604
{\an5}Are you Princess's protector?

20:03.535 --> 20:05.604
{\an1}I felt bad that
she felt like that.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.272
{\an1}Are you going
on their honeymoon with them?

20:07.339 --> 20:09.908
{\an4}No, Max.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.908
All right, I'm just trying
to figure out like,

20:09.975 --> 20:11.944
'cause you acting
like you gotta do this.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.279
{\an5}And you don't gotta
do nothing.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.279
Okay.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.481
You don't have
to do nothing.

20:16.548 --> 20:20.419
I am not trying to be in other
people's business at all,

20:20.485 --> 20:22.921
but Princess telling me
about this prenup

20:22.988 --> 20:26.959
has put me in
the same situation I put her in

20:27.025 --> 20:28.627
when I told her
about my store.

20:28.694 --> 20:30.462
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

20:30.529 --> 20:32.664
{\an1}All this being in the middle
of people's business

20:32.731 --> 20:34.166
ain't for you.

20:34.232 --> 20:36.001
I'm just telling you

20:36.068 --> 20:37.469
it's time to switch it up
a little bit.

20:40.672 --> 20:44.843
{\an7}Max and Brandi have acquired
a sex tape of me

20:44.910 --> 20:46.378
{\an8}by way of Jason.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.348
{\an7}My question then was,
who's the person?

20:49.414 --> 20:52.050
{\an8}He says, "He's a rapper."

like Andrew and Nikki.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.569
Andrew was sitting in court
with me all day long.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.870
And then I get out of jail

22:18.937 --> 22:20.872
and they're both
there to bail me out.

22:27.145 --> 22:28.447
I never wanna go back to jail.

22:28.513 --> 22:31.383
Six hours in jail
felt like an eternity.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.251
It ain't for me, okay?

22:33.318 --> 22:34.686
{\an8}♪ Staring at the night sky ♪

22:34.753 --> 22:36.988

22:49.668 --> 22:51.703
This morning my girl Masika
reached out to me

22:51.770 --> 22:53.505
{\an8}to inform me
that this dough boy,

22:53.572 --> 22:56.308
{\an8}Jason Lee, is still running
his mouth about me.

22:56.374 --> 22:59.478
And you would've thought that
after my lawyers reached out

22:59.544 --> 23:01.146
he would have zipped it.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.781
So I'm catching up
with Masika today

23:02.848 --> 23:05.283
so I can fill her in
on what's really going on.

23:05.350 --> 23:07.018
{\an8}What the (bleep)
happened?

23:07.085 --> 23:10.822
{\an8}So... Max and Brandi

23:10.889 --> 23:14.993
{\an1}have acquired a sex tape
of me by way of Jason.

23:15.060 --> 23:18.363
{\an1}My question then was,
who's the person?

23:18.430 --> 23:20.265
{\an8}So I know this
lame Chihuahua would try

23:20.332 --> 23:21.700
{\an8}some type of retaliation,

23:21.767 --> 23:24.035
{\an8}but trying to dig up
a sex tape, to put it out?

23:24.102 --> 23:26.071
What woman would try to
do this to another woman,

23:26.138 --> 23:28.073
and most importantly,
what "mother,"

23:28.140 --> 23:30.008
since that's what you
like to talk about so much,

23:30.075 --> 23:32.310
would expose another mother?

23:32.377 --> 23:34.913
{\an1}Dreux calls me then
later that day and says,

23:34.980 --> 23:36.314
{\an1}"I kind of shook it
out of Jason.

23:36.381 --> 23:38.650
He says he's a rapper."

23:38.717 --> 23:41.486
So I'm like,
light bulb!

23:41.553 --> 23:44.222
{\an5}I dated this guy
named Phillip...

23:41.553 --> 23:44.222
Mm-hmm.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.359
{\an1}... on and off for like
two, two-and-a-half years.

23:47.425 --> 23:49.594
{\an1}And it was not like
a fly-by-night,

23:49.661 --> 23:51.196
hump-on-me situation.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.398
{\an1}Like it was
a I would go to Vegas,

23:53.465 --> 23:54.866
{\an1}he would come to LA,
we--

23:54.933 --> 23:55.934
So it was like
a legit thing?

23:56.001 --> 23:57.903
{\an1}It was a legit
like situationship

23:57.969 --> 23:59.304
{\an1}because he didn't live
here in LA,

23:59.371 --> 24:01.373
{\an1}so-- and I didn't
want long distance,

24:01.439 --> 24:03.008
{\an1}which was how we
ended it.

24:03.074 --> 24:05.210
But we ended as friends.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.746
{\an1}So I go to Phillip's
social media and I'm looking--

24:07.813 --> 24:12.184
{\an1}I see that he's gonna
be here in LA.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.618
{\an4}So I'm like,
all right.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.618
Okay.

24:13.685 --> 24:14.719
I'm going to pop up

24:14.786 --> 24:15.887
{\an1}and I'm gonna get
to the bottom of it.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.122
This is like
way too (bleep) much.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.290
Mm-hmm.

24:18.356 --> 24:21.293
{\an1}That's the only way I--
I see out of this.

24:21.359 --> 24:23.094
But I can't take
any (bleep) more.

24:23.161 --> 24:27.232
{\an1}More importantly, you have
some...

24:27.299 --> 24:30.502
{\an4}I've seen the tweets
between you and Hazel and...

24:27.299 --> 24:30.502
Girl.

24:30.569 --> 24:31.937
{\an1}You were like,
"The voice inflections.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.171
"Ain't no 1738.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.539
"Ain't no adlib.

24:34.606 --> 24:35.974
{\an1}This sounds likes
fat (bleep)."

24:36.041 --> 24:37.809
I was like
I gotta go.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.879
So there was a lot of unresolved
issues with Nazel and I.

24:40.946 --> 24:42.547
But you know what,
I don't give a (bleep),

24:42.614 --> 24:44.149
so I didn't even care to
address them.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.351
So when I was asked on
a talk show who was she,

24:46.418 --> 24:47.485
I said, "I don't know."

24:47.552 --> 24:50.488
So Nazel He posts
@MasikaKalysha--

24:50.555 --> 24:52.257
she knows exactly who I am--

24:52.324 --> 24:55.093
become the bitch just
did a song with @FettyWap,

24:55.160 --> 24:56.461
her baby daddy.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.496
So I press play and I hear
this voice come on.

24:58.563 --> 24:59.698
So I'm listening to it

24:59.764 --> 25:02.100
and I'm waiting for
Fetty's verse.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.535
And I'm like,
"Okay, so this is cool,

25:03.602 --> 25:04.669
but where's Fetty?"

25:04.736 --> 25:06.504
And I'm like,
wait a minute!

25:06.571 --> 25:08.440
This is not the guy.

25:08.506 --> 25:11.943
This-- this is actually
Betty Slop.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.380
So when I finally took
a painful ear

25:15.447 --> 25:17.649
to Nazel's track,
I called Fetty up

25:17.716 --> 25:20.051
and asked him if he heard
this debauchery

25:20.118 --> 25:21.319
and he didn't
even know who she was

25:21.386 --> 25:22.721
or what the song was
or anything.

25:22.787 --> 25:24.155
I had actually
FaceTimed him and I said,

25:24.222 --> 25:26.091
"I don't even know why I'm
bringing this up to you.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.727
"I just wanna know,
have you heard the song

25:28.793 --> 25:30.362
Hazel E put out saying
it's you?"

25:30.428 --> 25:31.830
And he was like,
"No, I don't even know

25:31.897 --> 25:33.031
what you're
talking about."

25:33.098 --> 25:34.466
So I'm like, "Okay, well,

25:34.532 --> 25:35.467
do you want me
to send it to you?"

25:35.533 --> 25:37.102
He's like, "Yeah."

25:37.168 --> 25:38.803
So we hang up,
I send it to him.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.972
It wasn't even like
two seconds.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.941
He is like,
"What the he..."

25:43.008 --> 25:44.609
Like it's just--
I can't even--

25:44.676 --> 25:46.278
the profanities,
the curse words.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.080
{\an1}So he's like, "Have the label
get that (bleep) down."

25:49.147 --> 25:50.515
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

25:50.582 --> 25:53.018
And for the same reason,
if he says it wasn't him,

25:53.084 --> 25:54.519
she would get attention
he didn't.

25:54.586 --> 25:56.755
{\an1}So I'm like, "Okay, well,
I'll be petty and post it."

25:56.821 --> 25:58.123
And he's like,
"Go for it."

25:58.189 --> 26:00.425
Masika is my sister
in petty crime.

26:00.492 --> 26:03.828
And it was slightly petty
for Masika to call Hazel out

26:03.895 --> 26:07.766
for allegedly lying about Fetty
being on her record.

26:07.832 --> 26:09.501
I don't know
Fetty's voice,

26:09.567 --> 26:11.870
but Masika was gung-ho
from the beginning

26:11.937 --> 26:13.505
that that was not him.

26:13.571 --> 26:16.107
Not the right tag,
not the right adlibs.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.176
But I don't study that man's
voice inflections,

26:18.243 --> 26:19.678
so I don't know.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.579
But I'm always gonna
support my friend.

26:21.646 --> 26:23.181
{\an1}I know no one has
seen her

26:23.248 --> 26:24.783
in a very long time.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.651
{\an5}This is Hollywood--

26:24.849 --> 26:26.651
It took a long time
to recover from

26:26.718 --> 26:28.386
all of that surgery.

26:29.821 --> 26:30.922
Here's the thing--

26:30.989 --> 26:32.624
{\an1}Eventually, you're gonna
run into the broad

26:32.691 --> 26:33.758
{\an1}so you might
as well just--

26:33.825 --> 26:35.427
There's no conversation
at all,

26:35.493 --> 26:38.063
unless you apologize
for the ignorant comment

26:38.129 --> 26:39.230
you said about
my child.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.699
I get it,
you're embarrassed.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.667
You lied about a record.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.669
Put it out, tried to
make money off of it

26:44.736 --> 26:46.137

put you back in your place

and he ripped it up.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.831
It was drafted
by his lawyer?

27:46.898 --> 27:48.099
It was drafted
by his lawyer

27:48.166 --> 27:49.401

that I should've
done my name too,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.795
and we've had verbal
agreements before

28:16.861 --> 28:18.229
when he didn't
follow through

28:18.296 --> 28:20.198
{\an5}with what he promised.

Ray and I had a fight,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.283
he bought the rights to my name.

28:38.349 --> 28:41.486
Another time, he basically
stole my car.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.421
When things go bad
between me and Ray,

28:43.488 --> 28:45.523
I just can't trust him.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.958
{\an5}I do have a question.

28:45.590 --> 28:46.958
{\an1}Sure.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.061

{\an1}if he ever has another child

28:54.365 --> 28:55.600
Okay, that's interesting.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.102
{\an1}No one's ever
asked that before.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.703
I could draft it.

I have no guarantees that
Ray's not gonna step out on me,

29:01.406 --> 29:03.374

29:03.441 --> 29:05.610
you better believe I'm taking

30:03.234 --> 30:05.236
Get out of my car!

30:05.303 --> 30:06.437
{\an1}Mom!

30:06.504 --> 30:07.772
{\an5}Bitch, get out
of my car!

30:06.504 --> 30:07.772
Hold on!

30:07.839 --> 30:08.973
Get out of my car!

30:09.040 --> 30:10.141
Why are you here?!

30:10.208 --> 30:12.010
I don't care if...

30:12.076 --> 30:13.144
(bleeps).

30:13.211 --> 30:14.312
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

30:14.379 --> 30:17.048
Yo, my mom is
all wound right now.

30:17.115 --> 30:19.083
There's no way this time

30:19.150 --> 30:21.052
that she's gonna be able
to say it was Pam.

30:21.119 --> 30:24.889
And though I will
always have my mama's back,

30:24.956 --> 30:26.524
there's a way to say
"get out of my car"

30:26.591 --> 30:28.026
without touching nobody.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.094
She came with me
because I asked her to.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.529
You didn't want A1 to be here.

30:31.596 --> 30:32.797
You were very clear
about that.

30:32.864 --> 30:35.433
So Pam actually offered,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.235
thinking that at some point
you guys would like

30:37.302 --> 30:38.670
hug it out or something,

30:38.736 --> 30:40.805
and I was like, "Let's just
make peace for once."

30:40.872 --> 30:43.441
Like does it always have to
be almost a fight every time?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.177
{\an1}You thought that that
would be okay for me to--

30:46.244 --> 30:47.612
Is anything okay?!

30:47.679 --> 30:48.646
{\an1}She was sitting there,
chilling,

30:48.713 --> 30:49.948
{\an1}driving my car
like it was hers.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.816
This is not fair for me.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.117
Like you guys
don't even try.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.719
{\an1}Yeah, but she shouldn't have
been behind my wheel!

30:54.786 --> 30:56.421
She drove for me!

30:59.724 --> 31:03.394
I love my daughter more
than anything in the world.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.496
She is my world.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.966
I don't know what it is
about Pam,

31:08.032 --> 31:11.202
but the sight
of her makes me mad.

31:11.269 --> 31:14.372
It's been such a challenge
accepting the fact

31:14.439 --> 31:18.409
that A1 and Pam
are now a part of our world.

31:18.476 --> 31:19.811
At this point, Pam,

31:19.877 --> 31:22.714
{\an1}I wanna believe that you're
sincere in your heart

31:22.780 --> 31:24.382
{\an1}because I am
a forgiving person

31:24.449 --> 31:25.717
and I can forgive you

31:25.783 --> 31:27.585
{\an1}even though I'm still
heated about

31:27.652 --> 31:30.688
any of my feelings about
all the things you said.

31:30.755 --> 31:31.856
{\an5}But, Mom, you gotta
let that go.

31:30.755 --> 31:31.856
You know?

31:31.923 --> 31:32.857
{\an1}I know!

31:32.924 --> 31:34.392
{\an1}But it's a process--
know that.

31:34.459 --> 31:35.627
{\an1}I would be
fake to sit here

31:35.693 --> 31:37.428
{\an1}and say it's just
gone away.

31:37.495 --> 31:39.564
Can we just try to be
a family?

31:39.631 --> 31:41.933
Can we just try, please?

31:42.000 --> 31:43.334
(Pam)
Whether I like it or not,

31:43.401 --> 31:44.969
I'm stuck with Lyrica G.

31:45.036 --> 31:48.206
{\an8}At least for as long
as our kids stay married.

31:48.273 --> 31:49.574
Can you hug
a person?

31:49.641 --> 31:51.142
Can you hug me?

31:51.209 --> 31:53.177
{\an5}Can you hug a person?

31:51.209 --> 31:53.177
She just asked you
for a hug.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.245
She can hug me.

31:54.312 --> 31:55.913
{\an5}Oh, see.

31:54.312 --> 31:55.913
Mom, don't be like that.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.815
{\an4}She want a hug, what
difference does it make?

31:55.980 --> 31:57.815
No, don't be like that.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.550
{\an5}No, that's a difference
that it makes.

31:57.882 --> 31:59.550
It makes a lot
of difference.

31:59.617 --> 32:00.852
{\an5}I wanna see
you guys hug.

31:59.617 --> 32:00.852
{\an1}Oh my God.

32:00.918 --> 32:01.953
{\an1}I swear to God,
I'm not feeling it--

32:02.020 --> 32:03.221
You ain't even mean.

32:03.288 --> 32:05.023
{\an1}Look at your face, you ain't
that type of person.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.190
You is not mean.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.592
{\an5}Okay, so hug.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.592
Look at your face.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.160
Okay, so hug,
so hug.

32:09.227 --> 32:10.328
You gonna feel it.

32:10.395 --> 32:11.329
Now.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.097
{\an5}(squealing)

32:11.396 --> 32:13.097
{\an1}Oh my God.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.833
And I'm doing it for your
daughter and my son, okay?

32:15.900 --> 32:17.402
I cannot believe my eyes.

32:17.468 --> 32:21.506
This is all I've ever wanted
is for our family to be family.

32:21.572 --> 32:22.573
You ain't even mean.

32:22.640 --> 32:23.875
{\an1}And we're
too grown and--

32:23.941 --> 32:25.109
I already know that.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.277
Then what's
the problem, Lord?

32:26.344 --> 32:27.578
{\an1}Okay, now you're talking
over me.

32:27.645 --> 32:28.613
{\an5}No, no, no, no, no...

32:27.645 --> 32:28.613
{\an1}See,
that ain't cool.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.714
I'm making a point.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.316
I said, "Lord,
what's the problem?"

32:31.382 --> 32:32.684
I think y'all should
hug again.

32:32.750 --> 32:33.951
(laughing)

32:37.555 --> 32:39.724
{\an7}When are you gonna
send the tape?

32:37.555 --> 32:39.724
{\an5}When I get back,
when I get back.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.693
{\an7}I want every copy
you have.

against Jason

33:04.716 --> 33:06.250
lit a little
fire under his ass

33:06.317 --> 33:07.685
and he decided to call Dreux

33:07.752 --> 33:10.254
and sell out the mystery man
behind the sex tape.

33:10.321 --> 33:11.756

Phillip is someone that
I date on and off

33:18.996 --> 33:21.299
for about two,
two-and-a-half years.

33:21.366 --> 33:22.800
{\an8}I wanted more.

33:22.867 --> 33:25.236
{\an8}He didn't want to give me
what I felt I deserved,

33:25.303 --> 33:27.305
{\an8}so we agreed to be friends.

33:27.372 --> 33:30.475
{\an8}I cannot believe that
he would violate me

33:30.541 --> 33:33.845
{\an8}in so many different way,
on so many different levels.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.013
{\an4}(Moniece)
The last time we spoke,
I thought we were friends.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.215
{\an3}And we are.

33:37.281 --> 33:39.117
We're not friends.

33:39.183 --> 33:40.952
{\an1}You and I dated
on and off for, what,

33:41.018 --> 33:42.787
{\an4}roughly two years
maybe?

33:41.018 --> 33:42.787
Right.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.055
Right.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.157
{\an1}So when I'm in
my own little bubble

33:46.224 --> 33:48.860
{\an1}and my son's father shows up
to tell me...

33:50.661 --> 33:54.098
{\an1}... that Jason Lee has
acquired a sex tape of me

33:54.165 --> 33:55.233
by way of you.

33:55.299 --> 33:57.168
Not by way of me.

33:57.235 --> 33:58.569
{\an5}I have two phones--

33:57.235 --> 33:58.569
Who got it and how?

33:58.636 --> 34:00.338
{\an5}Listen, I have
two phones.

33:58.636 --> 34:00.338
Mm-hmm.

34:00.405 --> 34:02.940
{\an5}The tape--

34:00.405 --> 34:02.940
{\an1}Please make sense
of it, Phillip.

34:03.007 --> 34:05.676
{\an5}First of all--

34:03.007 --> 34:05.676
Make sense of it,
Phillip, quickly.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.078
{\an5}You have two phones.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.078
No.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.713
That phone becomes
missing--

34:08.780 --> 34:11.248
{\an5}Mysteriously.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.248
Yes, mysteriously.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.350
{\an6}You know--

34:11.315 --> 34:12.350
You don't know how?

34:12.417 --> 34:13.384
You know-- I don't know how.

34:13.451 --> 34:14.719
If I knew, it
wouldn't be missing.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.054
Jason Lee finds
the phone.

34:17.121 --> 34:19.257
I lost a phone, he was
supposed to return it.

34:19.322 --> 34:20.525
{\an5}He looked in the phone...

34:19.322 --> 34:20.525
How--

34:20.591 --> 34:22.427
... to see whose
phone it is

34:22.493 --> 34:24.195
and stumbled
across the video.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.563
{\an5}(Moniece)
This is clearly
the biggest, boldest,

34:26.630 --> 34:29.833
most ignorant lie
I have ever heard

34:29.900 --> 34:31.402
in my entire life.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.737
How is it that of all
the people you meet,

34:33.804 --> 34:37.909
Jason Lee happens to
be the one to find this phone,

34:37.975 --> 34:42.112
and this phone just so happens
to have a tape of me?

34:42.179 --> 34:43.915
The tape is safe
with me.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.817
Nobody will ever have it.

34:45.882 --> 34:47.985
{\an1}I want the only copies
of the tape that you have.

34:48.052 --> 34:49.454
There's only one copy
'cause it's in a phone.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.588
{\an4}Okay, well,
then I need it.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.588
All right.

34:50.655 --> 34:51.688
{\an1}You can send it to
my attorney.

34:51.755 --> 34:53.056
Attorney for what?

34:53.123 --> 34:55.960
{\an1}Somehow, someway,
a way that I don't believe,

34:56.027 --> 34:57.495
{\an1}that tape escaped
your possession

34:57.562 --> 34:58.696
and was put into
the possession of

34:58.763 --> 35:00.598
{\an1}someone else and then
disseminated.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.166
First of all, you don't
have to worry about

35:02.233 --> 35:03.601
your tape getting out 'cause
I would never to that to you,

35:03.668 --> 35:04.836
but if that was the case

35:04.902 --> 35:06.337
of me being
thirsty or whatever,

35:06.404 --> 35:08.873
I would just sell the tape
to-- and get the bag.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.374
We'd have just
handled it after that.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.711
Phillip can't look me in my face
and convince me

35:13.778 --> 35:15.246
that the tape
will never leak.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.315
It already did.

35:17.381 --> 35:19.984
{\an1}This is me genuinely
offended,

35:20.051 --> 35:21.719
genuinely disgusted

35:21.786 --> 35:25.523
{\an1}and 100% mother(bleep)
angry that,

35:25.590 --> 35:28.426
{\an1}as my friend,
you would not defend me

35:28.493 --> 35:31.863
{\an1}and say, "Yo, bitch, this
(bleep) is wrong!"

35:31.929 --> 35:33.431
Why wouldn't
you do that?!

35:33.498 --> 35:35.533
Listen, you don't know
what I said to--

35:35.600 --> 35:37.034
{\an1}So then why don't you
let me know,

35:37.101 --> 35:39.170
{\an1}as somebody that
I thought was my friend,

35:39.237 --> 35:40.972
{\an1}that would never do
this to me,

35:41.038 --> 35:44.141
{\an1}somebody that I dated,
not just (bleep) for fun,

35:44.208 --> 35:48.746
somebody that I confided in,
somebody that I trusted in,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.115
{\an1}someone who
I've had conversations with

35:51.182 --> 35:53.084
about a relationship...

35:53.150 --> 35:55.086
(Moniece)
For his sake, I hope he sends

35:55.152 --> 35:56.754
all the copies over to my
attorney

35:56.821 --> 35:58.256
as I have requested.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.558
Same way I found
him here...

36:00.625 --> 36:02.159
I can find him
and get him to a courtroom.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.160
{\an1}When are you
gonna send it?

36:03.227 --> 36:04.462
I'm gonna send it in
a few days.

36:04.529 --> 36:05.596
But stop acting like
it wasn't consensual.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.331
Nobody said that.

36:07.398 --> 36:09.634
{\an5}The point is that it
wasn't intentional.

36:07.398 --> 36:09.634
{\an1}But that's beside
the point!

36:09.700 --> 36:12.069

or not...

36:09.700 --> 36:12.069
Heard you, heard you.

{\an1}... you're the only person

{\an1}So when are you
gonna send the tape?

36:14.939 --> 36:16.541

36:16.607 --> 36:18.409
{\an4}When are you gonna
send the tape?

Hey!

37:13.631 --> 37:16.400

We don't drink
poison over here.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.439
We don't-- we don't
do that.

37:21.505 --> 37:22.974
Okay.

37:23.040 --> 37:26.577
So I'm out at a popping-ass club
in LA, doing a hosting,

37:26.644 --> 37:28.346
{\an8}having a ball.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.749
{\an8}But when I look over,
I see guess who?

37:31.816 --> 37:32.917

You wanna show up
to my party?

I guess I'm gonna
treat this bitch one time.

{\an5}(Masika)
I really don't care what
this bitch has to say to me.

37:47.531 --> 37:49.700
{\an8}The only thing I wanna hear
from that collagen creation

37:49.767 --> 37:51.602
{\an8}is an apology about
what you said about my daughter.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.406
{\an5}What's up, honey?

37:53.704 --> 37:55.406
How are ya?

37:55.473 --> 37:57.541
I'm great, just got
back in the country.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.144
I see you had so much to
say while I was gone.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.046
{\an4}Well, before I say
anything...

38:00.211 --> 38:02.046
Mm-hmm.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.349
{\an1}... are you ready to
apologize for the ignorant,

38:05.416 --> 38:09.053
cowardly, asinine comment
you made about my child?

38:09.120 --> 38:10.788
I think your child
is beautiful.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.590
{\an5}I didn't make
any comment about her--

38:10.855 --> 38:12.590
No, you did.

38:12.657 --> 38:14.592
Uh, you actually referred
to my record,

38:14.659 --> 38:16.327
{\an5}saying it wasn't
your BD--

38:14.659 --> 38:16.327
And it's not.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.461
And then I said,
"Well, maybe

38:17.528 --> 38:18.729
the child
isn't yours as well."

38:18.796 --> 38:20.131
{\an1}Okay, this is not up
for debate.

38:20.197 --> 38:23.067
Of all the people in
the world to lie and pretend

38:23.134 --> 38:24.435
like you had on a record,

38:24.502 --> 38:25.736
why would you pick
my daughter's father?

38:25.803 --> 38:27.371
Like are you that jealous
that you want

him and my house, my body?

It's not gonna
happen, sweetheart.

{\an1}So either you're
going to apologize

38:34.578 --> 38:36.180
{\an5}for what you said
about my child--

38:34.578 --> 38:36.180
I'm not ever going to
apologize.

38:36.247 --> 38:37.181
{\an1}Okay, well, then
you're done.

You have BD money.

{\an5}Why aren't you getting
some work done?

38:38.749 --> 38:40.284
Girl...

38:40.351 --> 38:42.086
I expected you
to look magnificent.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.188
{\an5}I'm actually disappointed.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.188

I am.

38:45.956 --> 38:48.759
{\an1}You just got sucked
and plucked and plump, so...

38:48.826 --> 38:50.428
(bleep)!

38:50.494 --> 38:51.762
Bitch... (bleep).

38:53.197 --> 38:54.632
{\an1}This bitch
is done.

38:54.699 --> 38:57.435
This bitch, for some reason,
thinks that she's almighty

38:57.501 --> 38:59.537
and that I should be
bowing down for her.

38:59.603 --> 39:01.772
Bitch, you're finished when
I say you're finished.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.742
That's why I went ahead
and had to do what I had to do.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.478
{\an1}(bleep) you, you (bleep)
dog-ass bitch!

39:07.545 --> 39:09.613
{\an4}That's what
the (bleep) I said, ho!

39:07.545 --> 39:09.613
I can't hear you,
Lispy.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.648
Listen, ogre!

39:10.715 --> 39:11.816
{\an4}Go back--

39:10.715 --> 39:11.816
{\an3}Calm down.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.851
{\an1}Go back to the cave
you came!

39:13.918 --> 39:16.487
So Nazel He,
as I turn my back,

39:16.554 --> 39:18.989
thrusts a few drops
of liquid

39:19.056 --> 39:20.524
on my natural tresses.

39:20.591 --> 39:21.692
I understand
that you get your hair

39:21.759 --> 39:23.227
from the barnyard floor.

39:23.294 --> 39:26.564
You should be glad that I didn't
take that wig off to dry it.

39:26.630 --> 39:27.965
Don't come play with
the big dogs

39:28.032 --> 39:29.600

handle it, baby girl.

"Love &amp; Hip Hop: Hollywood"...

39:37.908 --> 39:39.243

{\an7}Yes.

{\an8}to get a prenup.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.397
{\an7}Got little Brandi coming up
to me, yapping and--

40:00.464 --> 40:01.465
{\an8}Saying what?

40:01.532 --> 40:03.334
{\an8}That you wanted
to get a prenup.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.835
{\an7}Somebody's about to
get kicked out the wedding.

40:06.270 --> 40:08.405
{\an8}I just wanted to know
my worst-case scenario.

40:08.472 --> 40:09.473
{\an8}It's a misdemeanor,

40:09.540 --> 40:10.841
{\an7}but misdemeanors carry
up to a year.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.510
{\an8}Oh my goodness.

40:12.576 --> 40:15.045
{\an7}You wouldn't be in
the little lockup you were in.

40:15.112 --> 40:17.581

liked at all.
