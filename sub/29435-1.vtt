NEWSWOMAN:
The farmhouse belonging

00:10.227 --> 00:11.707
to the former Mossad director

00:11.750 --> 00:13.578
was the apparent target
of mortar fire.

00:13.622 --> 00:15.189
Several terror groups

00:15.232 --> 00:17.365
have already claimed
responsibility.

00:17.408 --> 00:20.933
I just got a call from Tel Aviv.
Ziva's dead.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.326
We've lost agents before,
haven't we?

00:22.370 --> 00:25.112
And when we do,
it's all hands on deck!

00:25.155 --> 00:26.504
She's more than an agent to you.

00:26.548 --> 00:27.940
She was a daughter to you.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.725
ELBAZ:
Tali is Ziva's daughter.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.074
And your daughter, Tony.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.510
BISHOP:
Ziva rented this place
from you?

00:32.554 --> 00:33.946
ZIVA:
Eleanor Bishop,

00:33.990 --> 00:35.731
for the safety of my family,

00:35.774 --> 00:37.341
please keep my secret.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.995
Hello, Gibbs.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.085
No time for pleasantries.

00:42.129 --> 00:43.739
You're in danger.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.310
Ziver.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.705
[horn honks]

00:53.749 --> 00:55.968
Yo, Willie. What's going on?
I've been waiting for you, man.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.970
I've been looking all over
for you. Let me holler at you.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.363
Listen, my girl's
waiting on me, man.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.104
Oh, two minutes
ain't gonna kill you.

01:01.148 --> 01:04.107
I guarantee I got a special
as special as you.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.155
Ring-a-ding-ding, baby.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.460
Prepaid.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.419
Call anyone anytime.

01:11.462 --> 01:14.117
No proof of said
communication.

01:14.161 --> 01:15.162
No problem.

01:15.205 --> 01:16.641
I got a phone.

01:16.685 --> 01:18.078
You got one
your girl don't know about?

01:18.121 --> 01:19.775
Forget it, man.

01:19.818 --> 01:21.168
Buying stolen crap off you

01:21.211 --> 01:22.734
isn't gonna solve my problems.Hey.

01:22.778 --> 01:25.041
Who said it was stolen?I say whatever I want, dude.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.956
Okay, well, then,
say it again. Come on.

01:26.999 --> 01:28.871
Hey, say it again!
Say it again!Get off me, man!

01:28.914 --> 01:30.264
MAN:
Give me the keys.

01:30.307 --> 01:32.701
[chuckles]
Hey, hey, listen, friend,

01:32.744 --> 01:34.094
uh, can we talk about this?

01:34.137 --> 01:37.619
I guarantee I got
a special as special as you.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.403
Give me the keys!

01:39.447 --> 01:41.449
Get out of here!

01:42.624 --> 01:45.235
[dog barking in distance]

01:46.932 --> 01:48.891
[engine starts]Let's go!

01:53.113 --> 01:55.027
Get what you needed?

01:56.725 --> 01:58.205
Drive.

01:58.248 --> 01:59.597

02:34.328 --> 02:35.851
Ziver.

02:38.288 --> 02:39.942
Where you been?

02:39.985 --> 02:42.466
Come. We must get you
to a safe house.

02:42.510 --> 02:43.989
Ziva.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.518
Hey.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.174
Look at me.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.179
What happened to you?

03:02.965 --> 03:04.314
[heavy gunfire]

03:04.358 --> 03:07.274
[indistinct shouting
in distance]

[man shouts in distance]

03:26.293 --> 03:27.598
They're coming in
through the front door.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.557
Do you have any ammo?Not here. You?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.298
I'm traveling light.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.517
[window shatters, clattering]

03:41.525 --> 03:43.614
To decompression.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.137
Hey, I'm gonna go vintage Gibbs.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.314
I'm gonna make up a new rule.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.969
You talk about work,
you buy the next round.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.580
Hey.Mmm.

03:52.623 --> 03:55.713
[sighs]
Decompression starts now.

03:55.757 --> 03:58.586
You talk about work,
you buy the next round.

03:58.629 --> 04:01.110
Hmm.I'll tell you, this...

04:01.153 --> 04:04.287
this case was really hard to
get out of my head, you know?

04:04.331 --> 04:05.767
It's like...

04:05.810 --> 04:08.204
I don't know. After
what happened to Emily,

04:08.248 --> 04:10.206
I don't think Gibbs is
gonna let this one go.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.034
Excuse me, young lady?

04:12.077 --> 04:13.296
This fine gentleman here

04:13.340 --> 04:14.950
would like to buy us
the next round.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.647
Muchas gracias.[chuckles][cell phone rings]

04:16.691 --> 04:18.345
McGee.

04:18.388 --> 04:21.043
Hey. I thought
you were, uh...

04:21.086 --> 04:23.350
sticking to club soda
for a while.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.308
Sounds like a lot of worry
coming from someone

04:25.352 --> 04:26.831
who doesn't really worry
about me.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.007
Okay, we'll be
right there.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.182
What's going on?

04:30.226 --> 04:32.141
Neighbors heard gunfire
at Gibbs' house.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.143
Alexandria PD responded.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.536
Place is shot to hell.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.624
What about Gibbs?

04:36.667 --> 04:38.278
Police reported one fatality.

04:42.412 --> 04:44.632
Jimmy's on his way.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.024
[sirens blaring]

04:46.068 --> 04:47.548
Damn.

04:47.591 --> 04:48.723
Well, looks like Gibbs

04:48.766 --> 04:50.072
improvised some kind
of explosive

04:50.115 --> 04:52.379
for when our dead guy
came down the stairs.

04:52.422 --> 04:56.513
Lots of casings and footprints
upstairs outside the window.

04:56.557 --> 04:57.993
Dead guy wasn't working alone.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.560
Gun's empty.

04:59.603 --> 05:02.214
Gibbs ran out of ammo down here.
What about upstairs?

05:02.258 --> 05:03.564
Three hidden weapons
that I know of,

05:03.607 --> 05:04.826
but Gibbs didn't take
any of them.

05:04.869 --> 05:05.914
What about the ironing board?

05:05.957 --> 05:07.263
Shotgun's still taped
underneath.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.830
Left his cell here, too.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.658
TORRES: All I know is
there's only one reason

05:10.701 --> 05:13.269
why Gibbs wouldn't take
any of those weapons upstairs.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.359
This guy's friends
took Gibbs hostage?

05:18.535 --> 05:20.145
This stuff has moved.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.279
What?These motors.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.541
They were against
the wall before.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.673
Gibbs must have moved them.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.938
Looks like
an old coal chute.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.378
[grunts]

05:35.422 --> 05:37.380
Fresh scuff marks.

05:37.424 --> 05:38.642
And blood.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.340
TORRES: So, Gibbs
climbed out of a slide

05:40.383 --> 05:41.732
used for coal 100 years ago?

05:41.776 --> 05:43.299
Doesn't get more Gibbs
than that.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.394
Got a piece of fabric here.

05:51.438 --> 05:52.787
Looks like wool.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.267
It's not exactly
Gibbs's style.

05:55.311 --> 05:56.965
Well, could be one of these guys
tore their pants

05:57.008 --> 05:58.575
as they were
chasing Gibbs out.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.490
BISHOP:
Or this other person

06:00.534 --> 06:01.796
could've been with Gibbs.

06:03.058 --> 06:04.320
An ally.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.974
Bishop, you got something else?

06:07.018 --> 06:09.064
No.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.638
GIBBS:
Our six is clear.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.422
Hold up.

06:19.466 --> 06:20.554
There's no time to rest.

06:20.597 --> 06:21.990
Hey, stop!

06:22.033 --> 06:24.427
I don't need a damn breather.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.778
I just want to know
who we're running from.

06:30.825 --> 06:32.435
There's a woman.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.002
Her name is Sahar.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.178
She wants me dead,
and now she's after you, too.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.832
There was more than one person

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
shooting at us
outside that basement.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.488
Sahar works with a team,

06:41.531 --> 06:44.142
but she herself
is the true threat.

06:44.186 --> 06:45.970
Who is she?

06:46.014 --> 06:47.494
I do not know.

06:47.537 --> 06:48.973
Got a description?

06:49.017 --> 06:50.192
No.

06:50.235 --> 06:51.846
I've never seen her.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.456
Well, why does she
want you dead?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.153
I do not know.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.200
Well, what did I do
to piss her off?

07:01.246 --> 07:03.248
We got zero intel.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.472
We play smart.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.474
A safe house.We head west.

07:11.518 --> 07:14.129
There's a junkyard on Bryson.

07:14.172 --> 07:16.131
We get a car running

07:16.174 --> 07:18.002
good enough to get
us to a safe house.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.874
We call for backup.
We make a plan.

07:19.917 --> 07:20.918
No.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.486
This battle is mine alone.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.488
And for me,
there's no time for breathing.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.055
You're the one
who said "safe house."

07:27.098 --> 07:28.360
Yes, for you, Gibbs!

07:28.404 --> 07:31.015
You must go there now.

07:31.059 --> 07:33.322
I'll get word to you
when it is safe to leave.

07:33.365 --> 07:34.323
Ziva.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.498
Stop!

07:35.542 --> 07:37.326
No! No, I will not be convinced.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.719
I will not be swayed.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.198
This is the only path
that'll lead me

07:40.242 --> 07:42.200
back to Tony, back to my Tali.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.899
I will find Sahar,
and I will kill her.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.395
[phones ringing]

08:03.439 --> 08:04.919
[elevator bell chimes]

08:04.962 --> 08:06.137
So?

08:06.181 --> 08:07.878
Any word from Gibbs?Nothing.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.707
Hospitals haven't checked in
anyone matching his description.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.143
Come on, guys,

08:12.187 --> 08:14.145
please tell me we've got
something to go on here.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.973
Our dead guy's friends
left his body clean.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.627
No weapon,
no cell phone, no I.D.

08:17.671 --> 08:18.933
Jimmy's doing
the autopsy now.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.674
We're hoping
that gives us something.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.458
So, until then, what?
We're just gonna sit

08:22.502 --> 08:24.634
on our asses and wait
for the phone to ring?

08:24.678 --> 08:26.723
If Gibbs could've contacted us,
he would have.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.725
He wouldn't just stay
out there on his own

08:28.769 --> 08:30.422
for no reason.He might not be alone.

08:30.466 --> 08:31.989
What do you mean?
Who could he be with?

08:32.033 --> 08:33.382
McGEE:
I get the feeling Bishop

08:33.425 --> 08:35.950
had a theory, but, uh,
she didn't say what.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.082
Bishop should've beat us here.
Where is she?

08:38.126 --> 08:40.084
I thought she was with you guys.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.012
[sighs]

08:59.626 --> 09:01.628
[dog barking in distance]

09:01.671 --> 09:02.933
[creaking]

09:05.545 --> 09:07.372
That's rather unnerving.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.940
I-I noticed your car
parked out front.

09:09.984 --> 09:12.377
I wasn't expecting to see you
here on a work morning.

09:12.421 --> 09:14.379
Where's the coat?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.207
I'm sorry?Ziva's coat. It was hanging

09:16.251 --> 09:18.558
right there, and it was made
of fabric exactly like this.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.255
As you know,
I'm-I'm not responsible

09:20.298 --> 09:22.126
for any items left
in this office.Okay, listen to me.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.041
This game you're playing,
I'm done with it.

09:24.085 --> 09:25.956
You know how I got this?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.655
Whoever was wearing it was just
involved in a massive shootout.

09:32.354 --> 09:33.964
Is she all right?

09:35.009 --> 09:37.272
I think she escaped with Gibbs.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.319
Odette.

09:41.363 --> 09:44.627
Haven't I earned
her trust by now?

09:44.671 --> 09:46.673
Haven't I earned yours?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.896
You thought the death
of Ziva David

09:52.940 --> 09:56.073
was nothing more
than collateral damage.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.988
That the explosion
at the farmhouse

09:58.032 --> 10:00.774
was meant to destroy
the files of Eli David.

10:00.817 --> 10:03.341
It was really meant
to take out Ziva.Yes.

10:03.385 --> 10:06.518
She was the true target
of that attack all along,

10:06.562 --> 10:08.520
and she suspected as much.

10:08.564 --> 10:10.174
She used her
presumed death

10:10.218 --> 10:13.177
as a protective shield
for herself and her family.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.658
She sent her daughter to live
with the child's father.

10:15.702 --> 10:18.182
Tony.Then she went
deep undercover.

10:18.226 --> 10:22.273
For years, she sifted
through evil in every form,

10:22.317 --> 10:25.363
searching for the person
who wanted her dead.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.887
And that kind of...

10:26.930 --> 10:30.151
separation from everything
the heart holds dear, it...

10:30.194 --> 10:32.936
takes its toll in many ways.

10:32.980 --> 10:36.070
What about Tony? I mean, d...
d-does he know that she's alive?

10:36.113 --> 10:39.116
Does he know about any of this?That is not for me to say.

10:39.160 --> 10:43.120
But hear this message
loud and clear, Agent Bishop.

10:43.164 --> 10:46.994
The more people
who know Ziva David is alive,

10:47.037 --> 10:49.649
the more danger she's in.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.869
Who are you, really?

10:57.047 --> 10:59.049
[water dripping,
footsteps echoing]

11:03.706 --> 11:05.665
[exhales]

11:08.755 --> 11:10.234
[footsteps echoing]

11:10.278 --> 11:11.409
[gasps]

11:14.325 --> 11:16.980
[panting]

11:19.417 --> 11:21.855
TALI:
Ima!

11:21.898 --> 11:22.856
[distorted, echoing laughter]

11:22.899 --> 11:24.727
GIBBS:
Ziver.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.642
What happened to you? TALI: Ima, you wear it.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.557
[sighs]

11:28.600 --> 11:30.951
ZIVA:
I am weak.

11:30.994 --> 11:34.128
They believe the story.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.130
They believe you are dead.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.741
Ziva, we will
work together.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.569
We will find this
threat against you,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.614
and we will neutralize it.

11:42.658 --> 11:46.009
And you'll have
Tony and Tali again.

11:51.667 --> 11:55.236
I'm not myself, Adam.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.281
I am weak.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.419
Weakness...

12:06.160 --> 12:09.903
...is not accepting help
when you need it, my friend.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.038
Thank you.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.975
[humming a lullaby]

12:43.719 --> 12:45.895
GIBBS:
Are you okay?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.205
If you were gonna follow me,

12:51.248 --> 12:52.989
why the charade
of letting me go?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.557
Looked like
you needed space.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.566
GIBBS:
Found this.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.134
Someone ditched it in here.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.137
It's got one live round.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.491
You keep it.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.105
Ziva, I know
you want to work alone.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.325
I want to honor that,
but I can't.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.242
When I finally learned the name

13:28.285 --> 13:30.635
of this person
that wants me dead,

13:30.679 --> 13:32.768
I decided to stop hiding.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.292
The plan was simple.
Show myself.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.294
Kill Sahar before she killed me.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.644
She came after you first.Why?

13:39.688 --> 13:42.125
She does not know about Tali.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.301
What about DiNozzo?What could he possibly provide

13:44.345 --> 13:46.608
except tales of
old heartbreak?

13:46.651 --> 13:49.132
No.
[chuckles]

13:49.176 --> 13:50.786
She went after the person
she thought

13:50.830 --> 13:54.703
was most important to me
to use as leverage against me.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.710
You and I...
[chuckles]

14:01.753 --> 14:04.408
we are not who we once were.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.023
No matter who we are,
I'm not leaving you.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
I have a contact.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.991
He left me some intel.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.560
[exhales]
I must retrieve it.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.823
We must get out of here
and find a bus.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.086
Junkyard car is still
faster than a bus.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.133
[grunts] I'm not talking
about just any bus.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.094
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.968
Nick. Hey, yeah, it's me.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.665
I know. No, I know. I know.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.450
I was just... I was following
a lead on that fabric.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.889
No, it turned out
to be a dead end, so I, um...

14:52.587 --> 14:55.242
I, uh... I've got
to call you back.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.939
What are you doing here?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.724
Back at Gibbs' house,

14:59.768 --> 15:01.596
I could tell something
was going on with you.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.250
And you didn't show up
back at headquarters.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.513
So you pinged my phone?

15:05.556 --> 15:08.385
You want to tell me what you're
doing at Ziva's old office?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.736
Look, I can ask
as senior field agent

15:11.780 --> 15:13.434
or I can ask as a friend.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.915
But I'm not leaving here
until you give me an answer.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.659
The person Gibbs is with...

15:23.748 --> 15:25.489
...it's Ziva.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.929
She's alive.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.464
McGee, wait.I-I'm done talking about it.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.248
Well, I'm not.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.642
You knew and you didn't tell me.
What else is there to say?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.470
A lot. Just hear me out.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.385
My God, you have the
freaking legs of a giraffe.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.995
Just please, stop walking.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.651
Okay, all right.
Does Tony know?

15:56.694 --> 15:58.479
Huh? How long have you known?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.960
Were you ever planning
on saying anything?

16:02.700 --> 16:05.181
I can't even look
at you right now.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.055
[door closes]

16:10.578 --> 16:12.406
Hey. She asked me
not to say anything.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.060
I was just trying
to keep her safe.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.757
You can't just walk
into the men's room.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.498
Well, I just did,
so get over it.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.847
I'm not gonna get over it.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.370
Listen to me. Okay...

16:20.414 --> 16:22.851
Ziva has meant so much
to so many people.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.853
When she asks you
to do something,

16:24.896 --> 16:27.203
you trust her
and you do what she asks.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.727
Bishop, she was a sister to me.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.948
Okay? I had a right to know.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.386
I want to make this right.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.780
[sighs]

16:40.390 --> 16:42.349
If we're gonna help
Gibbs and Ziva,

16:42.392 --> 16:46.048
we need to put all the intel
we have together and find them.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.398
So start from the beginning
and tell me everything you know.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.400
Okay.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.012
We have to keep this between us.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.928
[indistinct chatter]

17:01.107 --> 17:03.196
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Falls Church City Park.

17:03.239 --> 17:07.809
Transfers available:
M23, M25 and M32.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.073
[sighs]

17:11.117 --> 17:14.859
Next stop is:
Broad Street and Falls Avenue.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.430
Sure would be nice to know
what we're doing here.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.694
Five seats
ahead of us on the left.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.046
GIBBS:
We're getting our intel

17:27.089 --> 17:29.091
from Grizzly Adams and his mom?No.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.616
Under that seat,
my contact left an SD card.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.402
When the passengers leave,
I will retrieve it.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.231
[chuckles]:
Wow.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.234
Wow, I haven't heard of a
drop on a bus since 1980.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.931
[laughs]
Well, that is rich,

17:42.974 --> 17:45.064
coming from a man with
a black-and-white television.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.762
I assume you still
have one of those.Hey, what I'm saying is

17:47.805 --> 17:50.069
we're putting our necks on the
line to trust this contact.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.244
Yes.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.202
So, can we trust him?

17:56.814 --> 17:57.989
You're not leaving this room

17:58.033 --> 17:59.774
until you tell me
what you found.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.733
Sahar has sent her men
to bring in Gibbs.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.432
She will use him to get to you.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.522
They'll never take him alive.
I must warn him.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.132
Ziva.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.483
If they find you with Gibbs,
you will pay the price.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.399
And so will I.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.314
GIBBS:
Ziva.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.230
Ziva.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.406
Can we trust him?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.930
I do not wish
to discuss my contact.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.155
Lady and gentlemen,

18:33.199 --> 18:35.940
I expect that when one of
our own goes off the grid,

18:35.984 --> 18:39.422
you'd have the common sense
to walk up here and update me

18:39.466 --> 18:41.729
without me having
to hunt you down.Yes, sir.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.209
Well, now that
I've hunted you down,

18:43.252 --> 18:44.732
I suggest that you get to it.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.125
Kasie analyzed
the casings

18:46.168 --> 18:48.170
found outside Gibbs'
basement window.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.476
Bullets were American-made.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.955
We also found a piece of fabric

18:50.999 --> 18:52.957
on the coal chute that Gibbs
used to escape from.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
But, uh,
that was a dead end.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.917
Well, the fabric
could belong to someone

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
that Gibbs is working with.Or not.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.790
BISHOP:
It could be from one
of his attackers.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.009
We don't have clarity
on that yet.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.750
Hoping to get some new leads
from Jimmy.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.143
We're headed down
to autopsy now.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.622
John Doe from Gibbs's basement.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.971
So, you're telling me

19:07.015 --> 19:09.670
you have nothing
on where Gibbs is now,

19:09.713 --> 19:12.629
who he's with
or who used his residence

19:12.673 --> 19:13.674
for target practice?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.502
Unfortunately, no.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.591
Do I need to make a speech
about the mountains

19:17.634 --> 19:20.115
that Gibbs would move
if the roles were reversed here?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.465
No, sir. We're aware.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.163
Then get back to work.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.295
And the minute you
find something,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.776
I'm your first call.Sir.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.519
Hey.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
You guys want to tell me
what's going on?

19:34.564 --> 19:37.088
Yeah, we're going to autopsy.No, no, no, no, no.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.177
Your neck is sweaty.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
What?
When you lie,

19:39.395 --> 19:40.353
your neck sweats.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.094
No, it doesn't.

19:44.748 --> 19:48.404
Please tell me we didn't
just lie to the director.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.105
Oh, wow.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.065
Oh, my God.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.980
My head is exploding.[Bishop sighs]

19:59.023 --> 20:00.329
We shouldn't have told him.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.939
Well, that's not
your choice to make.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.854
Listen, Nick, Jimmy's gonna
be down here any minute.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.856
Okay? We got to
keep this quiet.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.380
I mean, I didn't even know
this ninja,

20:07.423 --> 20:09.164
but this is, like,
the biggest news of my life.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.992
Ziva David is
freaking alive?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.255
[metal clattering]

20:14.517 --> 20:16.867
I'm sorry, uh, uh, c-come again?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.260
Jimmy, um...I dropped a pipette,

20:18.304 --> 20:20.175
and I was... I was
cleaning it up,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.134
and I heard you guys come in,
and-and I-I didn't say anything,

20:23.178 --> 20:24.658
and you guys were
talking, and...

20:24.701 --> 20:25.833
and I didn't
know what to do,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.051
uh, and then you said the...

20:27.095 --> 20:28.139
the thing about Ziva?

20:28.183 --> 20:30.316
And, uh...
and my ears heard it,

20:30.359 --> 20:32.492
and now I think, uh...
I think I need to...

20:32.535 --> 20:34.320
I-I think I need to sit down.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.844
Here.[mutters]

20:36.887 --> 20:39.325
What do we really know about
the attack at Gibbs's place?

20:39.368 --> 20:41.283
From what I got from Odette...

20:41.327 --> 20:42.806
Wait. The landlady?I think that's

20:42.850 --> 20:45.069
the least interesting
thing on her rÃ©sumÃ©.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.769
She said the person behind the
attack is a woman named Sahar,

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
motive unclear.No one comes at you that hard

20:50.814 --> 20:53.426
unless... unless you killed
someone that matters.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.428
That doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.256
Wait, Ziva's killed
that many people?

20:57.299 --> 21:00.998
Hey, guys, I thought maybe Jimmy
and I could do a tandem update.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.435
Whoa.

21:04.611 --> 21:08.049
There's, like,
some weird air in here.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.877
What's going on?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.444
Nothing.Nothing. No.
Not a whole lot.

21:11.487 --> 21:12.749
Pretty solid chance
I'm gonna throw up.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.535
Hey, is your neck sweating?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.537
[stammers]
Can we talk about your findings?

21:17.580 --> 21:19.060
Yeah. So, uh,

21:19.103 --> 21:22.585
John Doe here, his DNA
wasn't in the system...

21:25.022 --> 21:26.850
You want to hop on in there
with cause of death?

21:26.894 --> 21:28.635
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.376
Uh... [clears throat]

21:30.419 --> 21:34.075
Cause of death was, uh,
blunt force trauma.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.338
He hit his head
on the bottom step

21:36.382 --> 21:39.080
after the bomb...

21:39.123 --> 21:41.343
tumbled him backward.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
And he had...

21:42.953 --> 21:44.085
And he had...

21:44.128 --> 21:45.739
Red marks...Red marks, right.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.218
He had red mar...
he had red marks

21:47.262 --> 21:49.090
on the left side of his body.

21:49.133 --> 21:52.006
I confirmed that they
were bites from bedbugs.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.834
Uh, Mr. Doe here
is a side sleeper.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.052
Bites tell us
anything else?

21:55.096 --> 21:56.532
I collected a few
of the dead bugs

21:56.576 --> 21:57.838
from his clothing.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.448
We'll see if they have
anything to say.

22:02.582 --> 22:03.931
Okay, so listen.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.236
I got a thing
about weird air.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.848
I don't like it,
so I'm-a leave now.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.589
OTHERS:
Okay.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.592
Oh, sweet mama,
they're talking in unison.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.158
No. No. Mm-mm.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.297
Work boots like that,
he'll get off before downtown.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.213
Do not count your crocodiles
before they hatch.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.085
Right.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.486
Where'd you get that?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.183
The scar.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.492
That is not the question
you really wanted to ask.

22:44.537 --> 22:45.842
I got a lot of
questions, Ziva.

22:45.886 --> 22:47.496
I'm trying not to
ask the hard ones.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.195
The pills?

22:54.590 --> 22:57.158
[sighs] A couple of months
before the explosion,

22:57.201 --> 22:59.421
Tali and I went into this shop.

22:59.465 --> 23:04.426
She pointed to this necklace,
and-and-and she said, "Ima!"

23:04.470 --> 23:06.297
So I bought it for her.

23:06.341 --> 23:09.605
When I went to put it on her,
she said, "No, Ima."

23:09.649 --> 23:11.259
She wanted me to wear it.

23:11.302 --> 23:13.740
She wanted it for me.

23:15.481 --> 23:18.179
Whenever I held her,
she would take it

23:18.222 --> 23:22.009
between her little fingers
and-and she would smile.

23:24.098 --> 23:27.797
And now when I think about
holding her, I just...

23:27.841 --> 23:29.756
[exhales]

23:32.193 --> 23:34.500
If you had the chance
for one more minute

23:34.543 --> 23:35.936
with your daughter,
wouldn't you do anything

23:35.979 --> 23:37.546
in your power
to get back to her?

23:37.590 --> 23:39.809
Fight any demon with any weapon?

23:39.853 --> 23:43.117
If it meant you could hold her
one more time?

23:48.339 --> 23:51.473
One of my demons
has become anxiety.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.824
The pills, they...

23:54.868 --> 23:58.088
they quiet this demon, but...

23:58.132 --> 24:02.223
they also dull my senses, so...

24:02.266 --> 24:04.094
I will not be taking them
for now.

24:10.753 --> 24:12.146
[brakes hiss]

24:12.189 --> 24:13.669
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Now arriving at...

24:13.713 --> 24:15.018
He's leaving.

24:15.062 --> 24:17.194
â™ª

24:23.462 --> 24:25.028
The card is gone.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.943
He took it.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.513
He could not have gotten far.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.906
I'll loop around!

24:33.950 --> 24:35.648
I sent the file.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.911
You're going to have
to decrypt it.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.569
[grunting]

24:51.402 --> 24:53.404
[shouts, screams]

24:55.058 --> 24:57.452
Where's Sahar? Where is she?[grunting]

25:01.717 --> 25:02.892
Ziva!

25:02.936 --> 25:04.546
[grunts]

25:08.681 --> 25:10.117
You should have wounded him.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.684
We could've bled him
for information.

25:11.727 --> 25:13.250
Yeah, or he kills you first.

25:13.294 --> 25:14.643
Oh...

25:14.687 --> 25:17.037
[panting][siren approaching]

25:17.080 --> 25:18.255
Intel?

25:21.041 --> 25:23.173
We just need to decrypt it.

25:23.217 --> 25:24.827
[sighs]
We don't have time for this.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.002
Come on, let's go.

25:26.046 --> 25:28.091
[siren growing louder]

25:39.189 --> 25:40.451
Truck is clean.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.238
There's nothing that points
to where Sahar might be.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.067
Eh, we get the truck to NCIS,

25:47.110 --> 25:48.851
Kasie might be able
to pull something off it.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.158
This Kasie sounds
real impressive,

25:51.201 --> 25:52.899
but the answer's no.
Come on.

25:52.942 --> 25:55.466
Let's go.No. Got to make
a phone call first.

25:55.510 --> 25:58.295
To this Kasie?
McGee.

25:58.339 --> 26:00.428
Gibbs, I cannot
let you do that.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.430
I'm not asking your permission
on this one.

26:02.473 --> 26:04.301
This intel to be decrypted,
it is the whereabouts

26:04.345 --> 26:05.955
of someone who used to
work with Sahar.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.609
I do not want McGee
or anyone else

26:07.653 --> 26:09.306
showing up there
and getting hurt.Are you done?

26:09.350 --> 26:11.004
Once you get in that
truck, I will be.

26:11.047 --> 26:13.963
Grizzly already sent what was
on that thing to his people.

26:14.007 --> 26:17.227
Yes. And I will find a way to
decrypt it before they do.

26:19.055 --> 26:21.144
You sure about that?

26:21.188 --> 26:25.105
Ziva... what this is
is a race.

26:25.148 --> 26:27.107
Right now a head start
is the difference

26:27.150 --> 26:29.762
between winning
and dying.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.633
The truck can stay.

26:31.677 --> 26:35.898
But we are sending McGee
the file on this card.

26:38.248 --> 26:42.383
Gibbs.
Do not do this.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.298
[knocking]Stop the men's
room stuff.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.343
I'm coming in!All right, Bishop,

26:46.387 --> 26:48.215
you really need to stop
busting in here

26:48.258 --> 26:49.869
begging me to
forgive you, okay?

26:49.912 --> 26:51.522
That's not why I'm here.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.394
I'm not asking
for forgiveness.

26:53.437 --> 26:54.787
I stand by
what I did.

26:54.830 --> 26:56.353
I just need you
to understand it.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.704
Okay, seriously, somebody
is gonna call HR.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.575
Maybe me.Just listen to me.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.577
I grilled this guy
Matty at NSA,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.840
and he told me about
an operative in Syria

27:04.884 --> 27:08.104
who is aware of a woman
named Mira Sahar Azam.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.584
Is that the same name
Odette gave you?

27:09.628 --> 27:10.933
She only knew
the "Sahar" part,

27:10.977 --> 27:12.631
but it has to be
the same person.

27:12.674 --> 27:16.591
Mira Sahar Azam was thought
to have been a P.O.W. in Syria.

27:16.635 --> 27:20.334
She escaped one month before
the David farmhouse blew up.

27:20.377 --> 27:22.336
Were you able to pull
anything else off the name?

27:22.379 --> 27:25.078
No. It's like she's a ghost.[cell phone rings]

27:25.121 --> 27:26.296
McGee.

27:26.340 --> 27:27.733
McGee.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.952
Boss!

27:29.996 --> 27:31.258
Boss, where are you?

27:31.301 --> 27:33.086
Long story.

27:33.129 --> 27:34.609
Yeah, we-we figured
some of it out.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.089
Um, is she there?
Is Ziva there?

27:36.132 --> 27:38.526
He knows.

27:38.569 --> 27:40.223
Want to talk to him?

27:42.573 --> 27:45.620
She's here.
She says hi.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.449
Uh, we think we have
a full name for Sahar.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.320
Mira Sahar Azam.

27:50.364 --> 27:53.802
Mira Sahar Azam?
That mean anything?

27:54.847 --> 27:56.675
McGee, appreciate the lead,

27:56.718 --> 27:58.459
but you cannot get
involved in this.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.113
Who else there knows
what's going on?

28:00.156 --> 28:01.331
Just Torres.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.985
Uh, Jimmy found out, too.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.944
He was... under a table.

28:04.987 --> 28:06.423
Tim, you got to
keep this quiet.

28:06.467 --> 28:08.295
We're gonna find a way
to send you a file.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.644
Decrypt it, fast as you can.

28:09.688 --> 28:10.732
Okay. So I am getting involved?

28:10.776 --> 28:12.603
No, no. Just on the file.

28:12.647 --> 28:14.693
You call me back at this number
as soon as you have something.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.652
Oh, and, McGee, there is
a dead body in the alley

28:17.696 --> 28:19.523
between 16th and Mitchell.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.525
Bye.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.617
JIMMY:
Cause of death was a single
gunshot to the heart

28:26.661 --> 28:29.272
inflicted by an exceptionally
skilled shooter who knew

28:29.316 --> 28:32.232
within one eighth of an inch
exactly where to hit

28:32.275 --> 28:33.755
to cause the most damage.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.715
So, yeah, I think we can
safely narrow this down

28:36.758 --> 28:38.934
to one of two people.

28:38.978 --> 28:40.196
Did we I.D. this guy?

28:40.240 --> 28:43.156
No fingerprints,
no DNA in the database--

28:43.199 --> 28:44.810
same as his friend--
making this

28:44.853 --> 28:46.420
John Doe number two.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.727
Two bodies, zero leads.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.381
Doe number two is
a back sleeper, if that helps.

28:51.425 --> 28:53.166
Bedbugs here made
an absolute meal

28:53.209 --> 28:56.125
out of the back of
his arms and neck.

28:56.169 --> 28:57.910
These guys weren't sleeping
in the Four Seasons.

28:57.953 --> 28:59.607
Eh, not even close.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.869
Uh, the two Does do share

29:00.913 --> 29:02.697
another interesting
commonality, though:

29:02.741 --> 29:04.438
they both had
a significant amount

29:04.481 --> 29:06.614
of ash in their lungs.Smokers?

29:06.657 --> 29:09.312
More like they were breathing in
a big campfire.

29:09.356 --> 29:11.619
I decrypted the file Gibbs sent.

29:11.662 --> 29:14.317
Fastest geek in
the East, baby.It's an address

29:14.361 --> 29:16.319
belonging to someone
named Mr. Rogers.

29:16.363 --> 29:18.626
Location is a penthouse
in downtown D.C.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.802
I'll call Gibbs.No, I already did.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.109
He's on his way there.Well, let's roll.

29:23.152 --> 29:24.501
Gibbs said to stay put.

29:24.545 --> 29:26.503
What? Why?I have no idea.

29:26.547 --> 29:28.810
JIMMY:
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.551
Wait a minute.
You guys aren't thinking about

29:30.594 --> 29:32.553
actually going down there
anyway, are you?

29:32.596 --> 29:35.338
Because I-I am
super uncomfortable

29:35.382 --> 29:37.384
with being the only person
in this entire building

29:37.427 --> 29:39.821
to stop people from
finding out about...

29:39.865 --> 29:41.301
"Operation Z."

29:41.344 --> 29:44.521
[quietly]: Besides,
Gibbs already told you,

29:44.565 --> 29:46.828
do not go.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.569
How about the mountains
Gibbs would move

29:48.612 --> 29:50.005
if the roles were reversed?

29:50.049 --> 29:52.355
We don't know anything
about this "Mr. Rogers"

29:52.399 --> 29:54.053
or what they're
walking into.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.848
Let go of me.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.632
You want to know
what I would love?

30:10.591 --> 30:12.854
I would love to know
how these two

30:12.898 --> 30:15.857
homeless people got
all up in my crib.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.728
We took these off him.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.208
And those were
on the female.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.124
Hmm.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.128
[sighs]

30:27.129 --> 30:29.218
Oh.

30:29.262 --> 30:32.091
That is dope.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.222
Turkish?

30:33.266 --> 30:34.528
No.

30:34.571 --> 30:36.051
We're here for
some information.

30:36.095 --> 30:38.227
We need the location
of the woman named Sahar.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.663
That name doesn't ring a bell.

30:39.707 --> 30:42.275
What about
Mira Sahar Azam?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.368
That's an alias.

30:48.411 --> 30:52.546
But big props for even
knowing that much.

30:52.589 --> 30:54.591
[chuckles]

30:58.204 --> 30:59.858
Who are you?

31:02.730 --> 31:06.386
And think before you speak.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.692
Lies can get people hurt.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.914
My name is Ziva David.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.002
ROGERS:
No.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.526
Ziva David is dead.

31:22.402 --> 31:25.144
And yet, this is her face.

31:25.187 --> 31:27.842
The face of a real
American hero.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.583
[chuckles]

31:29.626 --> 31:31.237
Damn, this is messed up.

31:31.280 --> 31:32.586
Where is Sahar?

31:32.629 --> 31:35.589
If she knows
you're on U.S. soil,

31:35.632 --> 31:37.547
then so is she.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.594
But where?
Hell if I know.

31:40.637 --> 31:42.683
ZIVA:
You would know.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.076
You worked closely with her.

31:46.556 --> 31:50.821
Odd for a woman like you
to wear a...

31:53.259 --> 31:55.087
...decoration.

31:59.918 --> 32:04.313
A woman like you wears only
the thing that's her infinity.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.361
That which lasts forever,

32:08.404 --> 32:11.103
never leaves her,
never goes away.

32:11.146 --> 32:13.453
It's either her heart

32:13.496 --> 32:15.107
or her albatross.

32:16.935 --> 32:21.548
Pretty... please, tell me,
which one is this, Miss David?

32:21.591 --> 32:23.724
Why does Sahar want me dead?

32:23.767 --> 32:26.553
Because of your albatross.

32:26.596 --> 32:28.381
Because of your burden.

32:28.424 --> 32:31.297
Because of your
brother Ari.

32:31.340 --> 32:34.126
I could tell you
a real tearjerker

32:34.169 --> 32:35.997
about Ari Haswari.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.217
But you got to give me
a little, too, honey.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.827
So, tell me,

32:39.870 --> 32:43.004
what are you willing to
pay for what you want...

32:44.658 --> 32:46.268
...and for what you've done?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.269
Get down!

32:47.313 --> 32:48.444
[glass shatters][grunts]

33:03.329 --> 33:04.852
[yells, groans]

33:04.895 --> 33:06.375
Ziva!

33:11.511 --> 33:13.904
Buying stolen crap off you
isn't gonna solve my problems.

33:13.948 --> 33:15.036
Who said it was stolen?

33:15.080 --> 33:16.211
I say whatever I want, dude.

33:17.343 --> 33:18.997
BISHOP:
This is the place.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.173
Say it again!TORRES: Uh, yo,

33:21.216 --> 33:23.479
that gray-haired guy
is jacking that car.

33:23.523 --> 33:25.829
BISHOP:
Uh, that gray-haired guy

33:25.873 --> 33:27.701
looks a lot like Gibbs.GIBBS: Give me the keys!

33:27.744 --> 33:28.876
No.

33:28.919 --> 33:31.052
Get out of here!

33:31.096 --> 33:32.358
All right, on my go.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.190
[engine starts]

33:39.408 --> 33:41.541
GIBBS:
Let's go.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.022
Uh, McGee?

33:44.065 --> 33:46.241
What are we
doing, man?
Get in the car.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.026
We got to follow them.McGee, no.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.419
Get in.You saw her just then.
You both did.

33:50.463 --> 33:53.683
She was asking you
to stand down.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.338
Look, she knows what she needs
better than any of us.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.949
We have to trust her.
You have to trust her.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.614
K.H., let's giddyap
with that update.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.095
Daddy needs a new pair
of scrubs.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.924
[chuckles]Okay. First,
you and the Three Amigos

34:16.967 --> 34:19.231
are talking
in unison in autopsy,

34:19.274 --> 34:22.103
then the director calls and says
that he's on his way down

34:22.147 --> 34:23.713
for an update, and
now you're in here

34:23.757 --> 34:26.194
acting like
a cotton candy Gibbs?

34:26.238 --> 34:27.630
The director's
headed down right now?

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
He must know something's up.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.373
It's weird air, Jimmy,
and I don't like it.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.549
Okay, really fast, tell me
everything that you know.

34:33.593 --> 34:36.074
I just need to make sure that
you're not gonna say something

34:36.117 --> 34:37.423
the director shouldn't hear.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.512
Kasie, please.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.948
Look, everyone has left,

34:40.991 --> 34:42.906
I am under an immense amount
of pressure

34:42.950 --> 34:44.560
that you can't fathom

34:44.604 --> 34:46.823
and I can't discuss...
[stammers]

34:46.867 --> 34:48.825
because reasons.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.567
You are lucky
that you're so damn lovable.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.221
So, I managed to
pull blood samples

34:53.265 --> 34:56.224
from two of the bedbugs we got
off the dead guys' clothing.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.139
The first sample
matched John Doe number one,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.141
who the bug
had obviously bitten.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.491
And the second bug?It had been dead for months.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.624
Now, I'm thinking
its carcass just got stuck

35:04.667 --> 35:06.713
on Doe's clothing
while he slept.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.758
So the blood that
it was carrying

35:08.802 --> 35:10.847
was from someone
it had bitten months ago.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.153
Exactly.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.155
And that person was one

35:14.199 --> 35:16.940
Robert Hitchem.
He was arrested 15 years ago

35:16.984 --> 35:18.333
for armed robbery,
but after that,

35:18.377 --> 35:20.030
he bought a roadside diner,

35:20.074 --> 35:22.816
lived there, worked there
and turned his life around.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.774
Until he went back
to his old ways

35:24.818 --> 35:27.690
and helped our bad guys
in shooting up Gibbs's basement.

35:27.734 --> 35:31.477
Uh, no. Because this
is a "before" picture.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.655
There was a fire at
Bob's Diner five months ago.

35:35.698 --> 35:38.179
Robert Hitchem was killed
in the fire.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.442
The building
was abandoned.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.140
Kasie, what do we got?

35:42.183 --> 35:43.402
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

35:43.445 --> 35:44.751
Now, did the director
send you down here

35:44.794 --> 35:47.275
to try and trick us
into saying something?

35:47.319 --> 35:48.276
About what?About what?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.321
Oh, my God!

35:49.364 --> 35:50.800
Oh, we just talked in unison.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.585
[exhales sharply]
Okay.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.109
So, bottom line is, our bad
guys are breathing in ash

35:55.153 --> 35:56.937
from the fire
and sleeping on Hitchem's

35:56.980 --> 35:59.592
old bedbug-infested mattress
at his abandoned diner

35:59.635 --> 36:01.768
in the middle
of nowhere, Virginia,

36:01.811 --> 36:04.466
and I told Gibbs the same thing
when he called.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.685
Gibbs called?

36:08.427 --> 36:10.820
Was that part of the thing
I wasn't supposed to say?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.091
Was starting to wonder
if you were coming back.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.397
I surveyed the area.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.269
Three men, north side
of the building,

36:24.312 --> 36:26.445
heavily armed,
not visible from here.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.666
Also, I made a call.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.190
My associate is coming.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.237
I make a call,
it's World War III.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.718
You make a call, it's a party.My associate

36:38.761 --> 36:42.896
will bring everything we need
to take down Sahar.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.681
What exactly
is the guy bringing?

36:45.725 --> 36:50.338
The clasp was broken,
but I fixed it.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.471
I asked you a question.I fixed it while I was
sitting down there thinking

36:52.514 --> 36:54.516
of all the reasons why I
should walk away right now

36:54.560 --> 36:56.301
and do this on my own.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.433
You know, ever since
you showed up, I've been falling

36:58.477 --> 37:01.610
all over myself
trying to make you stay.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.656
I am done.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.353
Your way stops here.

37:05.397 --> 37:06.528
We do this the right way.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.964
Meaning what?

37:08.008 --> 37:10.140
Meaning, if she surrenders,
we arrest her.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.273
Gibbs, as long as she is alive,
she is a threat,

37:12.317 --> 37:14.493
and I will not have this threat
follow me back to my family...

37:14.536 --> 37:16.538
You do not want
to go down this road.

37:16.582 --> 37:20.542
The only way back to Tali,
back home, is if Sahar is dead.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.676
If you go outside the law,
you will lose who you are.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.068
You don't know who I am.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.505
You think
I don't know?!

37:26.548 --> 37:29.072
What you asked me on the bus,

37:29.116 --> 37:31.379
the answer,
Ziva, is yes.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.468
Yes, I would do anything
to have one more minute

37:33.512 --> 37:35.253
with my daughter.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.385
But it doesn't
matter.

37:37.429 --> 37:40.083
It does not matter, Ziva.
She's gone.

37:40.127 --> 37:44.000
I was not talking about Kelly!
I was talking about me.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.220
They reported my death,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.004
and you did not
question it.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.137
You didn't come
looking for me.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.272
You abandoned me.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.104
My associate is here.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.891
[sighs]

38:04.934 --> 38:06.719
Hope I didn't
keep you waiting.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.286
No.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.593
Gibbs?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.989
From your call, I gathered
time was of the essence.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.469
Still, I think
you'll find I curated

38:17.512 --> 38:19.166
a rather thoughtful collection.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.610
You sure he knows
how to handle these?

38:31.134 --> 38:33.572
Put me to work.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.400
I play a really good old lady.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.141
You've done
more than your share, O.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.841
Remember,

38:41.884 --> 38:44.800
on the other side of this,
your daughter is waiting.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.849
Keys.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.423
Director, I assure you,
everything we did

38:58.466 --> 38:59.946
was within the boundaries
of the law.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.339
Everything.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.384
We understand the gravity
of our actions,

39:03.428 --> 39:05.473
and we know
they won't be taken lightly.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.866
You're damn right, Agent Bishop.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.390
None of this
is being taken lightly.

39:09.434 --> 39:13.002
MPD is calling me about
a penthouse full of dead bodies,

39:13.046 --> 39:15.396
and I'm standing here
asking myself how long you knew

39:15.440 --> 39:17.616
about Ziva David
but you failed to inform me.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.401
Sir, I did what I had to do.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.012
Wow. Really? That's ballsy.

39:23.056 --> 39:26.102
You stood in my office, and you
lied to my face. All of you.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.626
Excuse me. I mean,
technically, the last time

39:27.669 --> 39:29.802
we were all in here,
I was in the dark, too.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.544
You think we give a damn
about technicalities, Nick?

39:32.587 --> 39:34.502
This is Gibbs's life
we're talking about.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.025
How could you not tell us?

39:36.069 --> 39:37.723
Hey, I'm the least
guilty one in here.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.551
Okay? Uh, Bishop
is the worst...[stammers]

39:39.594 --> 39:41.379
...and then there's McGee,
and then there's me.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.771
That's enough.
Agent Sloane is right.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.294
Lives are at stake here.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.774
We know where
Gibbs and Ziva are.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.255
I want the three of you there
as backup immediately.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.607
Things are gonna start
to get real dicey

39:52.651 --> 39:54.217
if I have to repeat myself.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.263
We're not going, Director.Excuse me?

39:56.306 --> 39:58.178
Ziva told us to stand down.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.397
You spoke to her?
No.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.702
Not in words. I saw her.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.182
But she didn't need to say it.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.618
She looked me right in the eye,

40:03.662 --> 40:05.098
and she asked
that we stand down.

40:05.141 --> 40:07.970
Agent McGee, unless
Ms. David somehow rose

40:08.014 --> 40:10.016
to the directorship
of this agency

40:10.059 --> 40:11.583
while I was out getting coffee,

40:11.626 --> 40:13.672
I would suggest that
the three of you get moving.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.195
Sir, you know Ziva.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.631
You know her.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.328
When she asks you
to do something,

40:18.372 --> 40:20.679
you trust her
and you just do what she asks.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.989
Leon, come on.
This is crazy.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731
Agent McGee, you
better hope to God

40:29.775 --> 40:31.211
that this is the right call.

40:36.738 --> 40:40.133
Your check-in is late.
Report back to me immediately.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.965

40:53.363 --> 40:56.236

41:01.676 --> 41:03.417
Powell?

41:06.072 --> 41:07.726
Powell.

41:12.557 --> 41:16.517
Your men outside didn't
surrender, and they're all dead.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.134
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.659
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

41:27.702 --> 41:29.878
in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.053
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

41:31.097 --> 41:32.315
one will be
provided for you.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.752
Ziva.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.494
If they find you with Gibbs,
you will pay the price.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.799
And so will I.

41:37.843 --> 41:40.149
ROGERS:
It's either her heart

41:40.193 --> 41:41.847
or her albatross.

If you go outside the law,
you will lose who you are.

You'd do well
to listen to him.

If you kill me, Ms. David,

a United States senator
will be dead by morning.

That is tomorrow's concern.
