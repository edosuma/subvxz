11:10.278 --> 11:11.409
[gasps]

11:14.325 --> 11:16.980
[panting]

11:19.417 --> 11:21.855
TALI:
Ima!

11:21.898 --> 11:22.856
[distorted, echoing laughter]

11:22.899 --> 11:24.727
GIBBS:
Ziver.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.642
What happened to you? TALI: Ima, you wear it.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.557
[sighs]

11:28.600 --> 11:30.951
ZIVA:
I am weak.

11:30.994 --> 11:34.128
They believe the story.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.130
They believe you are dead.

11:36.173 --> 11:38.741
Ziva, we will
work together.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.569
We will find this
threat against you,

11:40.612 --> 11:42.614
and we will neutralize it.

11:42.658 --> 11:46.009
And you'll have
Tony and Tali again.

11:51.667 --> 11:55.236
I'm not myself, Adam.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.281
I am weak.

12:03.113 --> 12:04.419
Weakness...

12:06.160 --> 12:09.903
...is not accepting help
when you need it, my friend.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.038
Thank you.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.975
[humming a lullaby]

12:43.719 --> 12:45.895
GIBBS:
Are you okay?

12:49.464 --> 12:51.205
If you were gonna follow me,

12:51.248 --> 12:52.989
why the charade
of letting me go?

12:53.033 --> 12:55.557
Looked like
you needed space.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.566
GIBBS:
Found this.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.134
Someone ditched it in here.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.137
It's got one live round.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.491
You keep it.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.105
Ziva, I know
you want to work alone.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.325
I want to honor that,
but I can't.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.242
When I finally learned the name

13:28.285 --> 13:30.635
of this person
that wants me dead,

13:30.679 --> 13:32.768
I decided to stop hiding.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.292
The plan was simple.
Show myself.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.294
Kill Sahar before she killed me.

13:37.338 --> 13:39.644
She came after you first.Why?

13:39.688 --> 13:42.125
She does not know about Tali.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.301
What about DiNozzo?What could he possibly provide

13:44.345 --> 13:46.608
except tales of
old heartbreak?

13:46.651 --> 13:49.132
No.
[chuckles]

13:49.176 --> 13:50.786
She went after the person
she thought

13:50.830 --> 13:54.703
was most important to me
to use as leverage against me.

13:58.359 --> 14:01.710
You and I...
[chuckles]

14:01.753 --> 14:04.408
we are not who we once were.

14:07.150 --> 14:10.023
No matter who we are,
I'm not leaving you.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.857
I have a contact.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.991
He left me some intel.

14:22.035 --> 14:25.560
[exhales]
I must retrieve it.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.823
We must get out of here
and find a bus.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.086
Junkyard car is still
faster than a bus.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.133
[grunts] I'm not talking
about just any bus.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.094
Thank you.
You're welcome.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.968
Nick. Hey, yeah, it's me.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.665
I know. No, I know. I know.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.450
I was just... I was following
a lead on that fabric.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.889
No, it turned out
to be a dead end, so I, um...

14:52.587 --> 14:55.242
I, uh... I've got
to call you back.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.939
What are you doing here?

14:58.201 --> 14:59.724
Back at Gibbs' house,

14:59.768 --> 15:01.596
I could tell something
was going on with you.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.250
And you didn't show up
back at headquarters.

15:03.293 --> 15:05.513
So you pinged my phone?

15:05.556 --> 15:08.385
You want to tell me what you're
doing at Ziva's old office?

15:10.083 --> 15:11.736
Look, I can ask
as senior field agent

15:11.780 --> 15:13.434
or I can ask as a friend.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.915
But I'm not leaving here
until you give me an answer.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.659
The person Gibbs is with...

15:23.748 --> 15:25.489
...it's Ziva.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.929
She's alive.

15:41.418 --> 15:43.464
McGee, wait.I-I'm done talking about it.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.248
Well, I'm not.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.642
You knew and you didn't tell me.
What else is there to say?

15:47.685 --> 15:49.470
A lot. Just hear me out.

15:49.513 --> 15:51.385
My God, you have the
freaking legs of a giraffe.

15:51.428 --> 15:52.995
Just please, stop walking.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.651
Okay, all right.
Does Tony know?

15:56.694 --> 15:58.479
Huh? How long have you known?

15:58.522 --> 16:00.960
Were you ever planning
on saying anything?

16:02.700 --> 16:05.181
I can't even look
at you right now.

16:06.487 --> 16:09.055
[door closes]

16:10.578 --> 16:12.406
Hey. She asked me
not to say anything.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.060
I was just trying
to keep her safe.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.757
You can't just walk
into the men's room.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.498
Well, I just did,
so get over it.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.847
I'm not gonna get over it.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.370
Listen to me. Okay...

16:20.414 --> 16:22.851
Ziva has meant so much
to so many people.

16:22.894 --> 16:24.853
When she asks you
to do something,

16:24.896 --> 16:27.203
you trust her
and you do what she asks.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.727
Bishop, she was a sister to me.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.948
Okay? I had a right to know.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.386
I want to make this right.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.780
[sighs]

16:40.390 --> 16:42.349
If we're gonna help
Gibbs and Ziva,

16:42.392 --> 16:46.048
we need to put all the intel
we have together and find them.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.398
So start from the beginning
and tell me everything you know.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.400
Okay.

16:50.444 --> 16:53.012
We have to keep this between us.

16:54.578 --> 16:56.928
[indistinct chatter]

17:01.107 --> 17:03.196
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Falls Church City Park.

17:03.239 --> 17:07.809
Transfers available:
M23, M25 and M32.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.073
[sighs]

17:11.117 --> 17:14.859
Next stop is:
Broad Street and Falls Avenue.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.430
Sure would be nice to know
what we're doing here.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.694
Five seats
ahead of us on the left.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.046
GIBBS:
We're getting our intel

17:27.089 --> 17:29.091
from Grizzly Adams and his mom?No.

17:29.135 --> 17:32.616
Under that seat,
my contact left an SD card.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.402
When the passengers leave,
I will retrieve it.

17:36.446 --> 17:38.231
[chuckles]:
Wow.

17:38.274 --> 17:41.234
Wow, I haven't heard of a
drop on a bus since 1980.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.931
[laughs]
Well, that is rich,

17:42.974 --> 17:45.064
coming from a man with
a black-and-white television.

17:45.107 --> 17:47.762
I assume you still
have one of those.Hey, what I'm saying is

17:47.805 --> 17:50.069
we're putting our necks on the
line to trust this contact.

17:50.112 --> 17:51.244
Yes.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.202
So, can we trust him?

17:56.814 --> 17:57.989
You're not leaving this room

17:58.033 --> 17:59.774
until you tell me
what you found.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.733
Sahar has sent her men
to bring in Gibbs.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.432
She will use him to get to you.

18:05.475 --> 18:08.522
They'll never take him alive.
I must warn him.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.132
Ziva.

18:10.176 --> 18:13.483
If they find you with Gibbs,
you will pay the price.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.399
And so will I.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.314
GIBBS:
Ziva.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.230
Ziva.

18:21.274 --> 18:23.406
Can we trust him?

18:23.450 --> 18:25.930
I do not wish
to discuss my contact.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.155
Lady and gentlemen,

18:33.199 --> 18:35.940
I expect that when one of
our own goes off the grid,

18:35.984 --> 18:39.422
you'd have the common sense
to walk up here and update me

18:39.466 --> 18:41.729
without me having
to hunt you down.Yes, sir.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.209
Well, now that
I've hunted you down,

18:43.252 --> 18:44.732
I suggest that you get to it.

18:44.775 --> 18:46.125
Kasie analyzed
the casings

18:46.168 --> 18:48.170
found outside Gibbs'
basement window.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.476
Bullets were American-made.

18:49.519 --> 18:50.955
We also found a piece of fabric

18:50.999 --> 18:52.957
on the coal chute that Gibbs
used to escape from.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.176
But, uh,
that was a dead end.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.917
Well, the fabric
could belong to someone

18:55.960 --> 18:58.180
that Gibbs is working with.Or not.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.790
BISHOP:
It could be from one
of his attackers.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.009
We don't have clarity
on that yet.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.750
Hoping to get some new leads
from Jimmy.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.143
We're headed down
to autopsy now.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.622
John Doe from Gibbs's basement.

19:05.666 --> 19:06.971
So, you're telling me

19:07.015 --> 19:09.670
you have nothing
on where Gibbs is now,

19:09.713 --> 19:12.629
who he's with
or who used his residence

19:12.673 --> 19:13.674
for target practice?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.502
Unfortunately, no.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.591
Do I need to make a speech
about the mountains

19:17.634 --> 19:20.115
that Gibbs would move
if the roles were reversed here?

19:20.159 --> 19:22.465
No, sir. We're aware.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.163
Then get back to work.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.295
And the minute you
find something,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.776
I'm your first call.Sir.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.519
Hey.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
You guys want to tell me
what's going on?

19:34.564 --> 19:37.088
Yeah, we're going to autopsy.No, no, no, no, no.

19:37.132 --> 19:38.177
Your neck is sweaty.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
What?
When you lie,

19:39.395 --> 19:40.353
your neck sweats.

19:40.396 --> 19:43.094
No, it doesn't.

19:44.748 --> 19:48.404
Please tell me we didn't
just lie to the director.

19:52.582 --> 19:54.105
Oh, wow.

19:55.324 --> 19:57.065
Oh, my God.

19:57.108 --> 19:58.980
My head is exploding.[Bishop sighs]

19:59.023 --> 20:00.329
We shouldn't have told him.

20:00.373 --> 20:01.939
Well, that's not
your choice to make.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.854
Listen, Nick, Jimmy's gonna
be down here any minute.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.856
Okay? We got to
keep this quiet.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.380
I mean, I didn't even know
this ninja,

20:07.423 --> 20:09.164
but this is, like,
the biggest news of my life.

20:09.208 --> 20:10.992
Ziva David is
freaking alive?

20:11.035 --> 20:13.255
[metal clattering]

20:14.517 --> 20:16.867
I'm sorry, uh, uh, c-come again?

20:16.911 --> 20:18.260
Jimmy, um...I dropped a pipette,

20:18.304 --> 20:20.175
and I was... I was
cleaning it up,

20:20.219 --> 20:23.134
and I heard you guys come in,
and-and I-I didn't say anything,

20:23.178 --> 20:24.658
and you guys were
talking, and...

20:24.701 --> 20:25.833
and I didn't
know what to do,

20:25.876 --> 20:27.051
uh, and then you said the...

20:27.095 --> 20:28.139
the thing about Ziva?

20:28.183 --> 20:30.316
And, uh...
and my ears heard it,

20:30.359 --> 20:32.492
and now I think, uh...
I think I need to...

20:32.535 --> 20:34.320
I-I think I need to sit down.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.844
Here.[mutters]

20:36.887 --> 20:39.325
What do we really know about
the attack at Gibbs's place?

20:39.368 --> 20:41.283
From what I got from Odette...

20:41.327 --> 20:42.806
Wait. The landlady?I think that's

20:42.850 --> 20:45.069
the least interesting
thing on her résumé.

20:45.113 --> 20:48.769
She said the person behind the
attack is a woman named Sahar,

20:48.812 --> 20:50.771
motive unclear.No one comes at you that hard

20:50.814 --> 20:53.426
unless... unless you killed
someone that matters.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.428
That doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.256
Wait, Ziva's killed
that many people?

20:57.299 --> 21:00.998
Hey, guys, I thought maybe Jimmy
and I could do a tandem update.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.435
Whoa.

21:04.611 --> 21:08.049
There's, like,
some weird air in here.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.877
What's going on?

21:09.920 --> 21:11.444
Nothing.Nothing. No.
Not a whole lot.

21:11.487 --> 21:12.749
Pretty solid chance
I'm gonna throw up.

21:13.837 --> 21:15.535
Hey, is your neck sweating?

21:15.578 --> 21:17.537
[stammers]
Can we talk about your findings?

21:17.580 --> 21:19.060
Yeah. So, uh,

21:19.103 --> 21:22.585
John Doe here, his DNA
wasn't in the system...

21:25.022 --> 21:26.850
You want to hop on in there
with cause of death?

21:26.894 --> 21:28.635
Oh, yes, right, yeah.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.376
Uh... [clears throat]

21:30.419 --> 21:34.075
Cause of death was, uh,
blunt force trauma.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.338
He hit his head
on the bottom step

21:36.382 --> 21:39.080
after the bomb...

21:39.123 --> 21:41.343
tumbled him backward.

21:41.387 --> 21:42.910
And he had...

21:42.953 --> 21:44.085
And he had...

21:44.128 --> 21:45.739
Red marks...Red marks, right.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.218
He had red mar...
he had red marks

21:47.262 --> 21:49.090
on the left side of his body.

21:49.133 --> 21:52.006
I confirmed that they
were bites from bedbugs.

21:52.049 --> 21:53.834
Uh, Mr. Doe here
is a side sleeper.

21:53.877 --> 21:55.052
Bites tell us
anything else?

21:55.096 --> 21:56.532
I collected a few
of the dead bugs

21:56.576 --> 21:57.838
from his clothing.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.448
We'll see if they have
anything to say.

22:02.582 --> 22:03.931
Okay, so listen.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.236
I got a thing
about weird air.

22:05.280 --> 22:07.848
I don't like it,
so I'm-a leave now.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.589
OTHERS:
Okay.

22:09.632 --> 22:12.592
Oh, sweet mama,
they're talking in unison.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.158
No. No. Mm-mm.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.297

33:46.285 --> 33:48.026
We got to follow them.McGee, no.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.419
Get in.You saw her just then.
You both did.

33:50.463 --> 33:53.683
She was asking you
to stand down.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.338
Look, she knows what she needs
better than any of us.

33:56.382 --> 33:58.949
We have to trust her.
You have to trust her.

34:08.959 --> 34:11.614
K.H., let's giddyap
with that update.

34:11.658 --> 34:14.095
Daddy needs a new pair
of scrubs.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.924
[chuckles]Okay. First,
you and the Three Amigos

34:16.967 --> 34:19.231
are talking
in unison in autopsy,

34:19.274 --> 34:22.103
then the director calls and says
that he's on his way down

34:22.147 --> 34:23.713
for an update, and
now you're in here

34:23.757 --> 34:26.194
acting like
a cotton candy Gibbs?

34:26.238 --> 34:27.630
The director's
headed down right now?

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
He must know something's up.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.373
It's weird air, Jimmy,
and I don't like it.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.549
Okay, really fast, tell me
everything that you know.

34:33.593 --> 34:36.074
I just need to make sure that
you're not gonna say something

34:36.117 --> 34:37.423
the director shouldn't hear.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.512
Kasie, please.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.948
Look, everyone has left,

34:40.991 --> 34:42.906
I am under an immense amount
of pressure

34:42.950 --> 34:44.560
that you can't fathom

34:44.604 --> 34:46.823
and I can't discuss...
[stammers]

34:46.867 --> 34:48.825
because reasons.

34:48.869 --> 34:51.567
You are lucky
that you're so damn lovable.

34:51.611 --> 34:53.221
So, I managed to
pull blood samples

34:53.265 --> 34:56.224
from two of the bedbugs we got
off the dead guys' clothing.

34:56.268 --> 34:58.139
The first sample
matched John Doe number one,

34:58.183 --> 35:00.141
who the bug
had obviously bitten.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.491
And the second bug?It had been dead for months.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.624
Now, I'm thinking
its carcass just got stuck

35:04.667 --> 35:06.713
on Doe's clothing
while he slept.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.758
So the blood that
it was carrying

35:08.802 --> 35:10.847
was from someone
it had bitten months ago.

35:10.891 --> 35:12.153
Exactly.

35:12.197 --> 35:14.155
And that person was one

35:14.199 --> 35:16.940
Robert Hitchem.
He was arrested 15 years ago

35:16.984 --> 35:18.333
for armed robbery,
but after that,

35:18.377 --> 35:20.030
he bought a roadside diner,

35:20.074 --> 35:22.816
lived there, worked there
and turned his life around.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.774
Until he went back
to his old ways

35:24.818 --> 35:27.690
and helped our bad guys
in shooting up Gibbs's basement.

35:27.734 --> 35:31.477
Uh, no. Because this
is a "before" picture.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.655
There was a fire at
Bob's Diner five months ago.

35:35.698 --> 35:38.179
Robert Hitchem was killed
in the fire.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.442
The building
was abandoned.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.140
Kasie, what do we got?

35:42.183 --> 35:43.402
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

35:43.445 --> 35:44.751
Now, did the director
send you down here

35:44.794 --> 35:47.275
to try and trick us
into saying something?

35:47.319 --> 35:48.276
About what?About what?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.321
Oh, my God!

35:49.364 --> 35:50.800
Oh, we just talked in unison.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.585
[exhales sharply]
Okay.

35:52.628 --> 35:55.109
So, bottom line is, our bad
guys are breathing in ash

35:55.153 --> 35:56.937
from the fire
and sleeping on Hitchem's

35:56.980 --> 35:59.592
old bedbug-infested mattress
at his abandoned diner

35:59.635 --> 36:01.768
in the middle
of nowhere, Virginia,

36:01.811 --> 36:04.466
and I told Gibbs the same thing
when he called.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.685
Gibbs called?

36:08.427 --> 36:10.820
Was that part of the thing
I wasn't supposed to say?

36:19.264 --> 36:21.091
Was starting to wonder
if you were coming back.

36:21.135 --> 36:22.397
I surveyed the area.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.269
Three men, north side
of the building,

36:24.312 --> 36:26.445
heavily armed,
not visible from here.

36:29.099 --> 36:30.666
Also, I made a call.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.190
My associate is coming.

36:34.496 --> 36:36.237
I make a call,
it's World War III.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.718
You make a call, it's a party.My associate

36:38.761 --> 36:42.896
will bring everything we need
to take down Sahar.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.681
What exactly
is the guy bringing?

36:45.725 --> 36:50.338
The clasp was broken,
but I fixed it.

36:50.382 --> 36:52.471
I asked you a question.I fixed it while I was
sitting down there thinking

36:52.514 --> 36:54.516
of all the reasons why I
should walk away right now

36:54.560 --> 36:56.301
and do this on my own.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.433
You know, ever since
you showed up, I've been falling

36:58.477 --> 37:01.610
all over myself
trying to make you stay.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.656
I am done.

37:03.699 --> 37:05.353
Your way stops here.

37:05.397 --> 37:06.528
We do this the right way.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.964
Meaning what?

37:08.008 --> 37:10.140
Meaning, if she surrenders,
we arrest her.

37:10.184 --> 37:12.273
Gibbs, as long as she is alive,
she is a threat,

37:12.317 --> 37:14.493
and I will not have this threat
follow me back to my family...

37:14.536 --> 37:16.538
You do not want
to go down this road.

37:16.582 --> 37:20.542
The only way back to Tali,
back home, is if Sahar is dead.

37:20.586 --> 37:23.676
If you go outside the law,
you will lose who you are.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.068
You don't know who I am.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.505
You think
I don't know?!

37:26.548 --> 37:29.072
What you asked me on the bus,

37:29.116 --> 37:31.379
the answer,
Ziva, is yes.

37:31.423 --> 37:33.468
Yes, I would do anything
to have one more minute

37:33.512 --> 37:35.253
with my daughter.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.385
But it doesn't
matter.

37:37.429 --> 37:40.083
It does not matter, Ziva.
She's gone.

37:40.127 --> 37:44.000
I was not talking about Kelly!
I was talking about me.

37:44.044 --> 37:46.220
They reported my death,

37:46.264 --> 37:48.004
and you did not
question it.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.137
You didn't come
looking for me.

37:52.313 --> 37:54.272
You abandoned me.

37:59.146 --> 38:01.104
My associate is here.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.891
[sighs]

38:04.934 --> 38:06.719
Hope I didn't
keep you waiting.

38:06.762 --> 38:08.286
No.

38:09.635 --> 38:11.593
Gibbs?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.989
From your call, I gathered
time was of the essence.

38:16.032 --> 38:17.469
Still, I think
you'll find I curated

38:17.512 --> 38:19.166
a rather thoughtful collection.

38:26.173 --> 38:28.610
You sure he knows
how to handle these?

38:31.134 --> 38:33.572
Put me to work.

38:33.615 --> 38:35.400
I play a really good old lady.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.141
You've done
more than your share, O.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.841
Remember,

38:41.884 --> 38:44.800
on the other side of this,
your daughter is waiting.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.849
Keys.

38:56.551 --> 38:58.423
Director, I assure you,
everything we did

38:58.466 --> 38:59.946
was within the boundaries
of the law.

38:59.989 --> 39:01.339
Everything.

39:01.382 --> 39:03.384
We understand the gravity
of our actions,

39:03.428 --> 39:05.473
and we know
they won't be taken lightly.

39:05.517 --> 39:06.866
You're damn right, Agent Bishop.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.390
None of this
is being taken lightly.

39:09.434 --> 39:13.002
MPD is calling me about
a penthouse full of dead bodies,

39:13.046 --> 39:15.396
and I'm standing here
asking myself how long you knew

39:15.440 --> 39:17.616
about Ziva David
but you failed to inform me.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.401
Sir, I did what I had to do.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.012
Wow. Really? That's ballsy.

39:23.056 --> 39:26.102
You stood in my office, and you
lied to my face. All of you.

39:26.146 --> 39:27.626
Excuse me. I mean,
technically, the last time

39:27.669 --> 39:29.802
we were all in here,
I was in the dark, too.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.544
You think we give a damn
about technicalities, Nick?

39:32.587 --> 39:34.502
This is Gibbs's life
we're talking about.

39:34.546 --> 39:36.025
How could you not tell us?

39:36.069 --> 39:37.723
Hey, I'm the least
guilty one in here.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.551
Okay? Uh, Bishop
is the worst...[stammers]

39:39.594 --> 39:41.379
...and then there's McGee,
and then there's me.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.771
That's enough.
Agent Sloane is right.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.294
Lives are at stake here.

39:44.338 --> 39:45.774
We know where
Gibbs and Ziva are.

39:45.818 --> 39:48.255
I want the three of you there
as backup immediately.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.607
Things are gonna start
to get real dicey

39:52.651 --> 39:54.217
if I have to repeat myself.

39:54.261 --> 39:56.263
We're not going, Director.Excuse me?

39:56.306 --> 39:58.178
Ziva told us to stand down.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.397
You spoke to her?
No.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.702
Not in words. I saw her.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.182
But she didn't need to say it.

40:02.225 --> 40:03.618
She looked me right in the eye,

40:03.662 --> 40:05.098
and she asked
that we stand down.

40:05.141 --> 40:07.970
Agent McGee, unless
Ms. David somehow rose

40:08.014 --> 40:10.016
to the directorship
of this agency

40:10.059 --> 40:11.583
while I was out getting coffee,

40:11.626 --> 40:13.672
I would suggest that
the three of you get moving.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.195
Sir, you know Ziva.

40:15.238 --> 40:16.631
You know her.

40:16.675 --> 40:18.328
When she asks you
to do something,

40:18.372 --> 40:20.679
you trust her
and you just do what she asks.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.989
Leon, come on.
This is crazy.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.731
Agent McGee, you
better hope to God

40:29.775 --> 40:31.211
that this is the right call.

40:36.738 --> 40:40.133
Your check-in is late.
Report back to me immediately.

40:43.528 --> 40:45.965

40:53.363 --> 40:56.236

41:01.676 --> 41:03.417
Powell?

41:06.072 --> 41:07.726
Powell.

41:12.557 --> 41:16.517
Your men outside didn't
surrender, and they're all dead.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.134
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:25.178 --> 41:27.659
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

41:27.702 --> 41:29.878
in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney.

41:29.922 --> 41:31.053
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

41:31.097 --> 41:32.315
one will be
provided for you.

41:32.359 --> 41:33.752
Ziva.

41:33.795 --> 41:36.494
If they find you with Gibbs,
you will pay the price.

41:36.537 --> 41:37.799
And so will I.

41:37.843 --> 41:40.149
ROGERS:
It's either her heart

41:40.193 --> 41:41.847

If you go outside the law,
you will lose who you are.

You'd do well

If you kill me, Ms. David,

a United States senator
will be dead by morning.

That is tomorrow's concern.
