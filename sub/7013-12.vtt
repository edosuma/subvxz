WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:07.269
Here you go, Red:
Belgian waffles.

00:07.340 --> 00:11.003
- What's Belgian about 'em?
- They crumble at the hands of the Nazis.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.513
This bacon is so amazing.

00:15.582 --> 00:19.018
Makes me regret
calling girls pigs all my life.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.645
Why is the loud one
eating my breakfast?

00:23.023 --> 00:27.289
Well, her father's in prison
and her mother's in Mexico.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.295
See, this is what I don't get
about your dad.

00:30.363 --> 00:34.857
If you're arrested for bribery,
can't you just bribe your way out?

00:36.436 --> 00:41.897
I mean, you're a briber.
That's what you do.

00:41.975 --> 00:47.038
My dad is broke. I mean, in fact,
the bank foreclosed on our ski cabin.

00:47.113 --> 00:50.139
Everything's gotta be moved out
this weekend...

00:50.216 --> 00:53.344
and it's all up to me.

00:54.921 --> 00:58.914
And I'm just so very small.

01:01.294 --> 01:05.424
Well, I'd like to help, but...
not as much as I'd like not to.

01:07.634 --> 01:10.296
Too late. Already packed
an overnight bag.

01:10.370 --> 01:16.104
Kitty, why is it we always do what you wanna do
and never do what I wanna do?

01:16.176 --> 01:19.976
It's in the Bible.
( Laughs )

01:21.281 --> 01:23.772
Well, have a fun weekend, Pops.

01:23.850 --> 01:28.287
Oh, you're coming too, pal.
And there's gonna be heavy lifting.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.481
You better bring Donna.

01:34.794 --> 01:38.025
Jackie, why can't Hyde help?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.032
Oh, that's right.
He's your boyfriend.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.534
I... guess that's punishment enough.

01:44.204 --> 01:46.399
Now, I've been with Steven
long enough to know...

01:46.473 --> 01:48.703
the best way to keep our relationship
going smoothly...

01:48.775 --> 01:52.677
is by never asking him to do stuff.

01:52.745 --> 01:56.078
So instead I told him I'd be out of town
this weekend for a big doll expo.

01:56.149 --> 01:59.778
Oh, there's a doll expo?

01:59.853 --> 02:02.788
Man, I've been lookin' for
Jungle-fightin' G.I.Joe.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.290
He's got vine grip
and poisoned darts.

02:05.358 --> 02:08.418
''Poison not included.''
( Chuckles )

02:08.495 --> 02:14.058
I left mine out in the rain. He got jungle rot.
I- I had to amputate his foot.

02:17.837 --> 02:20.601
- Okay, so you got plans this weekend?
- Yes, I do.

02:20.673 --> 02:22.698
- No, you don't.
- No, I don't.

02:22.775 --> 02:25.869
All right, good,
'causeJackie's at a doll expo...

02:25.945 --> 02:28.573
so I'm thinkin' you, me, Kelso
sneak up to her cabin...

02:28.648 --> 02:30.809
drink beer till we all look pretty.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.409
Great. Let me get rid of this customer.

02:33.486 --> 02:35.454
Next!

02:40.293 --> 02:42.454
- Read the top letter, please.
- It's an ''E.''

02:42.529 --> 02:44.554
No!

02:44.631 --> 02:46.656
Fail. Move along.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.827
Wh-What are you talkin' about, man?
That's an ''E.''

02:49.903 --> 02:52.701
'Kay, I'll give you one more chance.

02:52.772 --> 02:54.706
Read the top letter, please.

02:54.774 --> 02:58.107
- <i>''E. ''</i>
- No! Double fail!

02:59.646 --> 03:01.910
Double fail?
You made that up.

03:03.383 --> 03:08.480
This, my blind friend, is a <i>capital</i> ''E.''

03:10.623 --> 03:13.023
The double fail stands.

03:13.092 --> 03:15.287
Hey, wait a second.
Aren't you the guy...

03:15.361 --> 03:18.262
that got caught in the school shower
with the lotion and the <i>Playboy?</i>

03:18.331 --> 03:20.891
Pass, pass. Double pass.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.776
- Now, stay with me.
- Yeah. I'll be right on your bumper.

03:32.845 --> 03:35.871
- Don't tailgate.
- I'll keep a safe distance.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.577
Don't lollygag.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.653
- What do I even say?
-Just... smile and nod.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.953
Don't smile and nod.
You look like an idiot.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.996
- You know, I'm kind of excited about this road trip.
- <i>( Van Door Opens )</i>

03:55.068 --> 03:58.037
We've been talkin' about fooling around
in some place new and different-

03:58.104 --> 04:01.505
- <i>( Engine Starts )</i>
-you and me alone in a car
on a country road after dark?

04:01.574 --> 04:07.069
Yeah. And hey, if I don't get lucky with you,
we're bound to run into a farmer's daughter.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.876
Hmm.

04:09.949 --> 04:14.784
This is great: no broads,
just us guys.

04:14.854 --> 04:19.052
We can really get to know each other.

04:19.125 --> 04:23.425
Fez, you try and lure me in the hot tub,
and I'm kickin' your ass.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.732
I'm just saying,
we're all so tense.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.031
Well, we won't be for long.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.505
Last time I was here, I hid a stash.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.407
Just gotta remember where I put it.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.241
I know it was someplace
I could fit my hand.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.077
- Well, that rules out your face.
- What?

04:43.149 --> 04:45.140
Ow!

04:54.727 --> 04:58.823
Am I distracting you,
my big, strong driver man?

04:58.898 --> 05:02.265
Not at all, my... lonely hitchhiker.

05:07.240 --> 05:12.143
Well, how did you get your foot
all the way over here?

05:12.211 --> 05:14.577
You can thank my dad
for the ballet lessons.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.775
I will be sure to send him
a fruit basket.

05:17.850 --> 05:21.081
Wait. Wait a second. Donna,
when did that U-Haul we've been following...

05:21.154 --> 05:23.088
turn into an ice cream truck?

05:23.156 --> 05:28.059
- Oh- Oh, man. We lost Red.
- No. Wait, we can't be that far off-trail.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.493
- <i>( Paper Rustling )</i>
- Let's look atJackie's directions.

05:30.563 --> 05:33.930
Okay. ''I-43 to Highway 60.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.902
Head east when it gets different.''

05:37.970 --> 05:41.406
- ''When it gets different.''
What the hell does that mean?
- Wait. Let me see that.

05:41.474 --> 05:45.706
''Go a ways past the... fancy thing...

05:45.778 --> 05:49.407
and turn left at the ugly house.''

05:49.482 --> 05:53.282
Oh. Well, if the ''fancy thing's'' a dead cow,
then we're almost there.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.445
Hey, Kelso,
did you find the stash yet?

05:56.522 --> 06:00.253
No, there's nothin' in the kitchen
I can fit my hand in...

06:00.326 --> 06:03.727
you know, except for the garbage disposal.
( Screams )

06:03.796 --> 06:05.787
( Laughs )

06:09.035 --> 06:11.697
Well, I'm going to the corner
to buy some beer.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.166
Do not get in the hot tub without me.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.845
- <i>( Door Opens )</i>
- Man, it's like-

06:21.914 --> 06:26.248
- <i>( Door Closes )</i>
- that stash is probably starin' me right in the face.

06:26.319 --> 06:29.015
Oh! Ha!

06:30.390 --> 06:32.324
Yeah. It wasn't someplace
I could fit my hand.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.795
- It was someplace that could <i>eat</i> my hand.
- <i>( Vehicle Approaching )</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:41.595
- Hey. There's a truck pullin' up to the cabin.
- <i>( Brakes Squeak )</i>

06:41.667 --> 06:45.694
- Oh, it's Red!
- Is it a fire truck?

06:45.772 --> 06:48.798
The truck's not red.
The guy is Red, man. It's Red Forman.

06:48.875 --> 06:51.241
- Not it.
- <i>( Vehicle Doors Closing )</i>

06:51.310 --> 06:55.542
What? No, I said, ''Not it.'' If playground rules
aren't in effect, this is anarchy.

06:59.786 --> 07:03.745
Okay.Jackie's directions say,
''Pass the place I bought a green sweater.

07:03.823 --> 07:06.849
Don't stop.
The cotton has polyester in it.''

07:08.428 --> 07:10.623
This is great. We're lost.

07:10.696 --> 07:14.223
No, we're not lost.
We just need to find our bearings.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.736
( Sighs ) Where would she go around here
to find a green sweater?

07:17.804 --> 07:20.705
Why, the green sweater store, Donna.
Good thinking.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.968
Hey, why are you mad at <i>me?</i>

07:23.042 --> 07:26.443
I- Because you need to learn
to control your urges.

07:26.512 --> 07:31.142
If you'd have kept your big foot outta
my bean bags, we wouldn't be in this mess.

07:31.217 --> 07:35.347
Well, excuse me for reading <i>Cosmo</i>
and trying a little somethin'.

07:35.421 --> 07:38.413
If you think you're gettin' the topless nachos now,
you're crazy.

07:38.491 --> 07:42.791
Whatever. Ah, man, now I'm hungry.
I want my Twinkie.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.066
- You packed Twinkies?
- I packed <i>a</i> Twinkie.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.194
There's only one left, and it's mine.
Whoever packed it, snacked it.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.467
- I've been lookin' forward to it all day.
- Oh, you have?

07:57.844 --> 08:00.870
That's nice. That's-
That's very ladylike.

08:00.947 --> 08:04.474
- ( Gibberish )
- Eh.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.853
Jackie and the Formans are here.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.013
And we're not supposed to be here.

08:10.089 --> 08:13.252
And this is illegal.
We're busted.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.887
No, <i>you're</i> busted.
I'm out the bathroom window.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.892
What? Get off of me.

08:25.771 --> 08:28.262
( Voice Cracking )
Welcome to the cabin.

08:30.643 --> 08:33.736
- What are you doin' here?
- Yes!

08:33.813 --> 08:37.476
Well, you scared me.
I thought you were a robber.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.881
Now I really need to go to the bathroom.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.519
( Gasps )

08:44.590 --> 08:47.753
Yeah, there was no window in there.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.955
Steven, what are you doing here?

08:53.165 --> 08:55.360
Why don't you tell me?

08:58.504 --> 09:01.234
Oh, my God.
You heard about the foreclosure...

09:01.307 --> 09:06.768
and you knew I lied about the doll expo,
so you came up here to help me move my stuff.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.542
That's exactly what I did.

09:11.751 --> 09:13.810
And you found me out.

09:13.886 --> 09:17.083
Oh, Steven,
I completely misjudged you.

09:17.156 --> 09:21.286
I mean, somehow you've become
the boyfriend I always hoped you could be.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.022
And shame on you
for doubting me.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.663
Hey, I got beer and Pixy Stix.
Let's party.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.032
Hey, we said no broads.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.714
Why do you need alcohol?

09:48.788 --> 09:52.451
Is that beer really gonna
make your lives better?

09:52.525 --> 09:58.088
- Not if you don't let us drink it.
- ( Red ) Shut it.

09:58.164 --> 10:01.656
Now, let's clear this place out.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.431
If we hurry,
I don't have to sleep here.

10:05.504 --> 10:08.371
I hate nature.

10:08.441 --> 10:12.207
Oh, God. Steven, you know what? I thought you
finally understood what being a couple was about.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.543
Well, what is being a couple?

10:15.615 --> 10:18.083
It's all about give-and-take,
yin and yang.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.084
It's a philosophical paradox...

10:20.152 --> 10:22.848
like a tree falling in the forest
with no one around to hear it.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.380
Does it make a noise?
Who's to say?

10:26.459 --> 10:29.622
Okay. You're just confusing me.

10:29.695 --> 10:33.688
You see? It's murky.
That's what I'm up against.

10:33.766 --> 10:36.599
Oh, my God.
What a load of crap!

10:36.669 --> 10:40.605
Who's to say what crap is?

- ( Chuckles )
- Here. Pull my vase.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.537
Oh. I know this one.
No, thank you.

10:52.551 --> 10:57.955
No. Man, it's stuck. I put the stash in here,
and now I can't get my hand out.

10:58.024 --> 11:00.219
Oh, I can help.

11:00.292 --> 11:04.910
( Clicks Tongue ) Oh, damn.
I guess I left my Baby Oil in the other pants.

11:09.548 --> 11:13.678
- ( Straining )
- This vase smells like chocolate.

11:13.752 --> 11:16.585
Really? Aah!

11:18.157 --> 11:20.819

- ( Strains )
- What's goin' on?

11:31.637 --> 11:36.904
Oh,just a classic case
of hand stuck in vase.

11:36.976 --> 11:41.436
Well, get it off, or you'll have
a classic case of foot stuck in ass.

11:47.386 --> 11:50.253
- ( Groans )
- Hey, what's the teeny writing
on the bottom of the vase say?

11:50.322 --> 11:54.122
- What teeny writing? Aah!
- ( Both Giggling )

11:58.931 --> 12:01.525

12:14.980 --> 12:19.542
Steven, would you be careful?
That's my trophy for Prettiest Ballerina.

12:19.618 --> 12:21.813
( Gasps )
Oh, but that's right.

12:21.887 --> 12:25.414
You don't care about stuff
that's important to me.

12:25.491 --> 12:29.222
Hey, you know what? You're the one who lied
and said you were going to a doll expo.

12:29.294 --> 12:32.855
- Should've just told me what's goin' on with you.
- I shouldn't have to tell you.

12:32.931 --> 12:35.058
Okay? You should just know.

12:37.169 --> 12:39.103
- So-
- <i>( Kicks Box )</i>

12:39.171 --> 12:42.902
I'm just supposed to magically know that
''I'm going to a doll expo'' is Jackiespeak...

12:42.975 --> 12:47.503
for, uh, ''My parents' cabin is being foreclosed on.
I need help cleaning it out''?

12:47.579 --> 12:50.514
Yes.

12:50.582 --> 12:55.884
Steven, my family is falling apart,
and you've never, ever even asked about it.

12:55.954 --> 12:59.583
If you cared, you'd figure out what was
goin' on with me and find a way to help.

12:59.658 --> 13:01.888
Jackie, that's crazy.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.260
The only time people I know find a way to help
is when they're cuttin' a deal with the D.A.

She talked so much
on the way here...

to the hood of the van like a deer.

13:22.748 --> 13:24.682
Boy,Jackie looks mad.

13:24.750 --> 13:28.880
Yeah. I cheated on her, like, a hundred times,
and she never looked that pissed.

Come on, Kelso.
Grab that end of the couch.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.790

Why won't this thing come off? ( Strains )

14:23.308 --> 14:28.439
The Packers winnin' next year's Super Bowl-
That's what's in the bag.

14:34.620 --> 14:37.145
Is that what I think it is?

14:37.222 --> 14:40.214
If you mean paprika, yes, sir!

14:42.227 --> 14:44.320
Honey-

14:44.396 --> 14:47.422
Honey, paprika is red.

14:51.170 --> 14:54.731
If you mean green paprika, yes, sir!

14:56.909 --> 14:59.207
Green paprika?

14:59.278 --> 15:02.679
Hyde, what am I lookin' for here?

15:02.748 --> 15:04.739
( Sternly )
Oregano.

15:07.286 --> 15:09.652
If you mean oregano, yes, sir!

15:13.025 --> 15:16.483
( No Audible Dialogue )

15:16.628 --> 15:19.119
Did Jackie say anything
about Davis Street?

15:19.198 --> 15:24.101
Not unless it's ''the street
where I dropped my gum that time.''

15:24.169 --> 15:26.296
All right. That's it.
We're goin' home.

15:27.973 --> 15:32.672
- ( Exhales )
- And, Donna, I'm sorry about
what I said about your urges.

15:32.744 --> 15:36.942
I love your urges.
They've been... very good to me.

15:38.717 --> 15:41.948
Hmm. Thanks.
They do what they can.

15:45.624 --> 15:48.991
Um, I'm waiting for my apology.

15:51.096 --> 15:54.623
- For what?
- For that Twinkie you inhaled?

15:56.668 --> 15:59.637
Are you serious?

15:59.705 --> 16:03.664
( Scoffs )
Okay. I'm sorry I ate your Twinkie.

16:03.742 --> 16:07.234
You rolled your eyes.
It doesn't count if you roll your eyes.

16:09.047 --> 16:14.041
- Okay. I'm sorry I ate your Twinkie.
- Wh-You rolled your eyes again!

16:14.119 --> 16:17.145
- It was just a stupid Twinkie!
- It was <i>my</i> Twinkie, Donna.

16:18.223 --> 16:20.589
( Quietly )
It was <i>my</i> Twinkie.

16:23.462 --> 16:26.659
Do you idiots realize
how much trouble you're in?

16:28.066 --> 16:31.001
How can that bathroom
not have a window?

16:31.069 --> 16:32.593
Wh-What's goin' on?

16:32.671 --> 16:37.665
Well, apparently Hyde had a stash
that none of us knew anything about.

16:39.378 --> 16:43.439
Especially me- ( Chuckles )
though I think Fez knew too.

16:45.150 --> 16:49.644
That's the way you want it? Fine.
You have to sleep sometime.

16:51.156 --> 16:53.090
Okay, shut it.

16:53.158 --> 16:55.626
I'm calling your parents.

16:55.694 --> 16:57.889
I'm calling Immigration.

17:00.365 --> 17:02.663
And you-

17:02.734 --> 17:05.931
I warned you once about this crap.

17:06.003 --> 17:10.065
Now I have no choice.
You're outta the house.

17:10.142 --> 17:14.010
- No, wait. Look, that stash wasn't his. It was mine.
-Jackie-

17:14.079 --> 17:17.913
- Let me talk.
- Yeah, Hyde. Let her talk.

17:17.983 --> 17:22.477
Okay. Look, it's just- I've been having such
a hard time since my dad's been in jail...

17:22.554 --> 17:25.954
that I was looking for anything
that just might make me feel better.

17:26.023 --> 17:29.653
Mrs. Forman, it's like you with your menopause
and all that wine you're always drinkin'.

17:31.430 --> 17:33.489
<i>( Kelso )</i>
<i>No.</i>

17:36.234 --> 17:41.570
Well, you shut your dirty, little mouth.

17:46.445 --> 17:49.710
Now, Steven, you tell me the truth right now.
Is this yours or not?

17:49.781 --> 17:52.579
Mr. Forman, I'm telling you the truth.
It's not mine.

17:56.521 --> 17:59.217
Okay. Fine.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.124
Well, I don't care whose it is.
I'm throwin' it in the lake.

18:02.194 --> 18:04.924
What? I paid 20 bucks for that.

18:11.069 --> 18:13.867
You got my parents' number.

18:13.939 --> 18:16.772
That'll teach you to sell me out,
you son of a bitch!

18:16.842 --> 18:20.107
All right. All right. All right.
Let's go.

18:23.815 --> 18:27.683
So, I snuck up here behind your back...

18:27.753 --> 18:31.382
we have a huge fight,
and then you do something nice for me.

18:31.456 --> 18:35.825
It's like when the Grinch stole Christmas,
but all the little Whos sang anyway.

18:37.596 --> 18:40.463
I don't know. It's just what people do
for the people they care about.

18:40.532 --> 18:45.799
- Nobody I ever knew.
- That's 'cause you were poor,
and poor people are bad.

18:47.973 --> 18:51.739
But, look, it's like what I was
talkin' about before.

18:51.810 --> 18:56.975
I sensed you were in trouble, and I look for
a way to help you without you having to ask me.

18:57.048 --> 19:02.452
Jackie, to be fair, you heard Red say,
''Hyde, you're out of the house''...

19:03.555 --> 19:06.991
not ''Hyde, you're going to a doll expo.''

19:13.465 --> 19:15.729
- Well, anyway, thank you.
- Mmm.

19:17.702 --> 19:21.297
- Oh, so can you help me move
the mirror in the bathroom?
- What mirror?

19:21.373 --> 19:23.933
The one covering up the window.

19:31.283 --> 19:34.844
- Ah. That was a great trip.
- Yeah. Can't wait to do it again.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.356
Okay. Okay. Donna, I think...

19:38.423 --> 19:41.153
I may have overreacted a little bit.

19:41.226 --> 19:46.391
I mean, there are plenty
ofTwinkies in the world.

19:46.465 --> 19:51.266
I mean, sure, there was only one in the car,
and... you did go Godzilla on it...

19:53.605 --> 19:57.632
but... look, I'm sorry.

19:57.709 --> 20:02.942
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
it didn't taste very good.

20:03.014 --> 20:06.279
- I think it was a knockoff.
- Yeah, my mom buys ''Twonkies.''

20:08.086 --> 20:10.987
Look, Donna, we had a goal
at the beginning of this trip.

20:11.056 --> 20:14.219
We were gonna be romantic
in some place new and different...

20:14.292 --> 20:18.695
and I am a man who likes
to finish what he started.

20:18.763 --> 20:21.197
So may I suggest...

20:22.267 --> 20:24.201
on my kitchen table?

20:24.269 --> 20:26.260
Wha-

20:29.641 --> 20:34.305
You know what? Okay. All right. Yeah,
your parents won't be home until tomorrow.

20:34.379 --> 20:38.816
Oh, my God. You're going for this?
Okay. Okay.

20:38.884 --> 20:43.048
Great.
What the hell was in that ''Twonkie''?

20:45.156 --> 20:47.147
- <i>( Door Slides Shut )</i>
- <i>( Van Door Closes )</i>

20:54.866 --> 20:58.927
You believe that kid? First he doesn't show up,
then he blocks the driveway.

20:59.004 --> 21:03.338
Well, I will just be happy
to get back in our nice, quiet house.

21:07.746 --> 21:12.012
- Oh, my... God!
- <i>( Donna ) Oh, my God.!</i>

21:13.385 --> 21:15.876
All right.
It's Donna's butt.

21:17.055 --> 21:20.752
Damn it!
That's where I eat dinner!

21:32.737 --> 21:34.671
Scrub, damn it!

21:34.739 --> 21:37.833
I am scrubbing as hard as I can.

21:37.909 --> 21:40.173
This cleanser isn't strong enough.

21:40.245 --> 21:45.842
Kitty, it's bleach and lighter fluid.
There is nothing stronger.

21:45.917 --> 21:49.011
Well, it is not strong enough.

21:53.024 --> 21:55.891
- Nope. No good.
- We need a new table.
