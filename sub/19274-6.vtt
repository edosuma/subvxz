00:17.303 --> 00:20.641
♪ ♪

00:30.693 --> 00:31.314
You sure he's in there?

00:31.709 --> 00:32.767
Sixth race starts in ten.

00:33.127 --> 00:34.547
He's in there.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.978
...investor, right? It's
a quick, uh, eight-ball thing...

00:36.998 --> 00:37.979
Five grand buy-in.

00:37.999 --> 00:39.881
Should be a piece of cake.

00:39.901 --> 00:42.016
Well, this guy, he
shows up with two women,

00:42.036 --> 00:44.231
I mean, chests up to the ceiling.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.020
Suddenly I couldn't
remember my own name,

00:46.040 --> 00:48.056
never mind the numbers...

00:49.425 --> 00:50.792
Hey, Vinny.

00:50.812 --> 00:51.926
Hey, Scott.

00:51.946 --> 00:53.094
You guys are early.

00:53.114 --> 00:56.030
Sixth race doesn't start
for another ten minutes.

00:56.050 --> 00:58.166
Aw, we just came to
cheer for our horses.

00:58.186 --> 01:00.535
We got, like, what, 15
grand out there, right?

01:00.555 --> 01:01.869
Uh, right. 15.

01:01.889 --> 01:02.969
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

01:02.990 --> 01:05.339
'Cause the boss, he
heard it was more like 13.

01:05.358 --> 01:08.042
And word is it was 13 last time

01:08.062 --> 01:09.801
and the time before that.

01:09.822 --> 01:11.245
What? What? Who told him that?

01:11.265 --> 01:12.313
Doesn't matter.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.148
It matters, Vinny, because some jackass

01:14.168 --> 01:15.450
is screwing up my math.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.752
I mean, it only seems like 13

01:17.772 --> 01:19.787
because of the increased returns.

01:19.807 --> 01:21.589
You take the sixth race, okay?

01:21.609 --> 01:24.425
You want to drift Kentucky
Slim. Well, at nine-to-one,

01:24.445 --> 01:27.795
five grand's only gonna
return 45 minus the 17% take.

01:27.815 --> 01:28.696
You understand?

01:28.716 --> 01:31.299
So you got to use two grand

01:31.319 --> 01:34.135
to short Grandma's Noodles,
pushing Slim to 16-to-one.

01:34.155 --> 01:35.036
The only problem is...

01:35.056 --> 01:36.704
<i>Marone.</i> Stop talking.

01:36.724 --> 01:37.990
Scotty, check him.

01:39.060 --> 01:40.741
What are... You don't got to take...

01:40.761 --> 01:42.743
What are you doing?

01:45.900 --> 01:48.683
Guess what, Joe, I can do math, too.

01:48.703 --> 01:51.686
15 minus 13 is two.

01:51.706 --> 01:54.589
That's two grand you
been skimming from Leo.

01:54.609 --> 01:57.483
Whoa, you guys. Now, come
on, now. This is a mistake.

01:57.504 --> 01:59.543
- There's a lot to think about.
- Stop talking.

01:59.564 --> 02:01.297
Security!

02:14.416 --> 02:16.477
<i>We've got to get
on the new coding system.</i>

02:16.497 --> 02:18.513
<i>Yeah, but I don't want to
get on the new coding system.</i>

02:18.533 --> 02:20.181
I know, I know. But you have to use 'em.

02:20.201 --> 02:22.083
You keep putting the
old codes in your report,

02:22.103 --> 02:23.484
and it just keeps messing
the computer system.

02:23.504 --> 02:25.286
Why can't we just change
the computer system?

02:25.306 --> 02:27.488
When you're captain, you
can do whatever you want.

02:27.508 --> 02:29.290
But for now...

02:29.310 --> 02:31.826
- Okay.
- Don't panic!

02:31.846 --> 02:34.529
They're more scared of
you than you are of them.

02:34.549 --> 02:35.596
Gideon, we're working.

02:35.616 --> 02:37.632
Uh-huh. Paperwork.

02:37.652 --> 02:40.668
The cornerstone of every
successful police station.

02:40.688 --> 02:42.603
Like it or not, it's still important.

02:42.623 --> 02:45.273
Yes, well, so
is reading a crime scene.

02:45.293 --> 02:48.943
And these little guys are about
to make that a whole lot easier.

02:48.963 --> 02:50.578
They're called micro-drones,

02:50.598 --> 02:52.914
and they are capable of generating

02:52.934 --> 02:55.850
a 3-D crime scene photo in under

02:55.870 --> 02:56.851
five seconds.

02:56.871 --> 02:58.052
Not bad.

02:58.072 --> 03:01.359
Detective, your assessment?

03:01.380 --> 03:04.725
Suspect appears to have eaten
a rainbow sprinkle donut.

03:04.745 --> 03:07.495
- Mm.
- Gideon, sorry to interrupt your...

03:07.515 --> 03:09.864
whatever this is. Can
I borrow you a sec?

03:09.884 --> 03:12.934
Yes. As soon as we determine
this donut's time of death.

03:12.954 --> 03:15.203
Well, there's a situation.

03:15.223 --> 03:17.171
Guy here saying he wants to be a C.I.

03:17.191 --> 03:20.341
And this should interrupt
this coolness because...?

03:20.361 --> 03:22.777
Because it's not just any guy.

03:22.797 --> 03:24.545
Gideon, I need you.

03:24.565 --> 03:26.314
Now.

03:26.334 --> 03:28.449
All right.

03:33.107 --> 03:35.074
Well, hello, son.

03:36.644 --> 03:38.492
Dad.

03:43.684 --> 03:46.634
Look, I know that this
is an unusual situation,

03:46.654 --> 03:49.270
but, uh... but, frankly,
I'm in a tough spot.

03:49.290 --> 03:53.118
And, uh, since my brilliant
son bought a police station,

03:53.139 --> 03:55.321
coming here, that
seemed like a good idea.

03:55.342 --> 03:58.446
Although, suddenly, I'm thinking
I might be at a modeling agency.

03:58.466 --> 04:00.267
Why are you here?

04:00.288 --> 04:01.949
Well, it's a long and sordid story,

04:01.969 --> 04:03.384
but, uh, in a nutshell,

04:03.404 --> 04:05.419
the last few weeks, I've
been playing the horses

04:05.439 --> 04:08.289
with a fellow who happens to
be in the gambling business.

04:08.309 --> 04:09.423
You fixing races?

04:09.443 --> 04:10.424
Fixing?

04:10.444 --> 04:12.026
No. Not at all.

04:12.046 --> 04:13.845
Just, uh, harmless

04:13.866 --> 04:15.496
number-crunching, yeah.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.298
Uh, and that was fine,

04:17.317 --> 04:20.767
until I started hearing awful
things about this boss of mine,

04:20.788 --> 04:21.935
this, uh, Leo-Leo...

04:21.956 --> 04:22.970
Moretti?

04:22.990 --> 04:24.905
Moretti. You know him?

04:24.925 --> 04:26.736
Yeah, I'm familiar with his work.

04:26.757 --> 04:28.876
Well, then you know more than I do.

04:28.896 --> 04:29.877
I'm just a businessman.

04:29.897 --> 04:31.312
I mean, I had no idea

04:31.332 --> 04:32.780
that I was involved with a criminal,

04:32.800 --> 04:34.915
which is why I came
here when I realized...

04:34.935 --> 04:37.018
When you realized that
your scam went wrong.

04:37.038 --> 04:38.653
That's what this is, right?

04:38.673 --> 04:40.221
My son.

04:40.241 --> 04:41.989
He's always been resentful of the fact

04:42.009 --> 04:43.691
that a lot of my business ventures

04:43.711 --> 04:45.826
weren't as successful as I'd hoped.

04:45.846 --> 04:47.628
Never mind they put him through MIT.

04:47.648 --> 04:49.697
<i>Put me</i> through MIT?

04:49.717 --> 04:51.632
- Okay...
- Are you serious?

04:51.652 --> 04:55.336
Okay, Mr. Reeves, what
exactly are you offering here?

04:55.356 --> 04:57.838
Well, I was thinking, you
know, that if I could go back

04:57.858 --> 05:00.875
to this, uh, Moretti character
with some kind of a deal,

05:00.895 --> 05:03.177
you know, something illegal,

05:03.197 --> 05:07.481
then you guys could
record the transaction

05:07.501 --> 05:09.083
with some sort of hidden device,

05:09.103 --> 05:11.919
which I'm sure that my
genius son will come up with.

05:11.939 --> 05:13.587
You realize what happened here, right?

05:13.607 --> 05:15.990
He got busted scamming a bad guy,

05:16.010 --> 05:17.291
and now he's scamming us

05:17.311 --> 05:19.193
- to get out of it.
- I'm just trying

05:19.213 --> 05:20.261
to do the right thing.

05:20.281 --> 05:21.462
Give me a break!

05:21.482 --> 05:23.097
- You obviously intend...
- You're trying to use us

05:23.117 --> 05:24.298
as a "get out of trouble"...

05:24.318 --> 05:26.834
Okay, okay. Guys, guys... Okay!

05:26.854 --> 05:29.003
Family bonding time is over.

05:29.023 --> 05:30.805
Just take a minute.

05:30.825 --> 05:32.773
Gideon?

05:36.318 --> 05:37.745
<i>Hey, check it out.</i>

05:37.765 --> 05:40.848
I took Zingo to one of those,
uh, fancy grooming places.

05:40.868 --> 05:43.150
Cost, like, a million bucks, but, look,

05:43.170 --> 05:44.952
look how his coat just shines.

05:44.972 --> 05:45.953
Huh?

05:45.973 --> 05:47.254
Do you hear yourself?

05:47.274 --> 05:49.056
You know you treat that dog better

05:49.076 --> 05:51.425
than you do your girlfriends.

05:51.445 --> 05:55.363
Yeah, because Zingo doesn't
spaz out when I pet other dogs.

05:58.704 --> 06:00.567
"Woman with a bat."

06:00.588 --> 06:04.238
I'm guessing she's not headed to a game.

06:10.531 --> 06:11.712
Open up, damn it!

06:11.732 --> 06:14.099
I want my car back!

06:15.965 --> 06:17.546
Excuse me!

06:17.567 --> 06:20.421
Lady, excuse me, ma'am.

06:20.441 --> 06:21.789
- Hey! Lady! Hey.
- Hey!

06:21.809 --> 06:22.757
Chicago Police.

06:22.777 --> 06:24.058
There something we can help you with?

06:24.078 --> 06:25.192
I don't need help.

06:25.212 --> 06:27.061
My car got stolen.
I'm gonna get it back.

06:27.081 --> 06:28.829
The kid who took it lives in here.

06:28.849 --> 06:31.265
- How you know it was this kid?
- 'Cause it's obvious.

06:31.285 --> 06:33.300
Three cars go missing from
around here since he moves in.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.034
I see him out casing cars all
the time. I even got a picture.

06:36.055 --> 06:38.172
- That's right! I got your picture!
- Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:38.192 --> 06:39.807
Hey, hey, hey. Ma'am,
ma'am, ma'am, ma'am!

06:39.827 --> 06:41.442
You need to drop the bat, okay?

06:41.462 --> 06:42.910
Go home. Leave the policing to us.

06:42.930 --> 06:45.913
- Come on.
- What I need is my car,

06:45.933 --> 06:48.849
so I can go to work and not get fired!

06:48.869 --> 06:51.352
- Ma'am, I'm...
- Open up the damn door!

06:51.372 --> 06:53.954
Ma'am, I'm gonna count
to three. One, two...

06:53.974 --> 06:55.289
I'll take this.

06:55.309 --> 06:58.626
Now, we can either drive you
to work or drive you to jail.

06:58.646 --> 06:59.778
Your choice.

07:04.489 --> 07:05.744
Come on.

07:07.134 --> 07:09.003
Murphy,

07:09.023 --> 07:10.738
before he walked in that door,

07:10.758 --> 07:13.073
I had not spoken to my
father for six years.

07:13.093 --> 07:15.176
Why? Because he is, has been,

07:15.196 --> 07:18.145
always will be a con artist.

07:18.165 --> 07:21.582
Come on, you were a beat
cop for years, right?

07:21.602 --> 07:23.684
You're familiar with
the concept of lying.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.019
Yes, I know lying.

07:25.039 --> 07:26.939
But I also know Leo Moretti.

07:28.329 --> 07:30.925
He's been running rackets
in Chicago for decades.

07:30.945 --> 07:32.593
Drugs, stolen goods, even murder.

07:32.613 --> 07:33.861
If we catch him,

07:33.881 --> 07:35.496
it's great for the city and us.

07:35.516 --> 07:37.398
Great. Fantastic. I'm
sure there's lots of ways

07:37.418 --> 07:40.065
we can do that without
involving my father.

07:40.086 --> 07:41.768
I've tried, okay? Look.

07:41.789 --> 07:43.104
You see this guy?

07:43.125 --> 07:45.406
He was tired of Moretti putting
the squeeze on his family,

07:45.426 --> 07:47.074
so he turned state's evidence.

07:47.094 --> 07:48.876
This is what happened to him afterwards.

07:48.896 --> 07:51.078
None of our C.I.s will
go near Moretti now.

07:51.098 --> 07:52.613
Which is why we need your father.

07:52.633 --> 07:55.707
Who is unreliable and more
self-serving than a gas pump.

07:55.728 --> 07:57.776
So is every other C.I.
They're all working an angle.

07:57.797 --> 07:59.687
Well, my father has 50 angles.

07:59.707 --> 08:01.255
He is the smartest guy I know.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.990
He played you like a piano in there.

08:03.010 --> 08:05.392
First of
all, nobody's playing me.

08:05.412 --> 08:07.261
I see him for what he is.

08:07.281 --> 08:09.997
But this is a chance to get
a monster off the streets.

08:10.017 --> 08:11.733
Which is exactly what
he wants you to think!

08:11.753 --> 08:13.537
You're letting his charm
cloud your judgment.

08:13.557 --> 08:16.003
You're letting your feelings get in
the way of you doing your job.

08:16.023 --> 08:17.856
I don't have feelings about this!

08:29.718 --> 08:32.553
All right, listen up,
we're gonna do this.

08:32.573 --> 08:34.889
But if I get one whiff of your crap,

08:34.909 --> 08:37.558
I will stick your ass in prison so fast

08:37.578 --> 08:39.293
it will reverse the spin of the Earth.

08:39.313 --> 08:40.294
Are we clear?

08:40.315 --> 08:43.365
Whatever you say, son.

08:43.384 --> 08:44.516
Mm.

08:50.082 --> 08:52.331
Yep. That's Leo's place, all right.

08:52.351 --> 08:54.266
Not exactly a bastion of class.

08:54.286 --> 08:58.337
Mm. As opposed to the country
clubs that you hang out in.

08:58.357 --> 09:00.673
Look, our sources say
that Moretti's behind

09:00.693 --> 09:03.008
a holdup at a jewelry show last month.

09:03.028 --> 09:04.491
Did you hear anything about that?

09:04.512 --> 09:06.378
You know, as a matter of fact, I did.

09:06.398 --> 09:09.048
'Cause Leo's two gorillas
were babbling all week long

09:09.068 --> 09:11.016
about scoring some uncut diamonds.

09:11.036 --> 09:12.451
Two vendors were killed.

09:12.471 --> 09:14.219
If those diamonds are from that holdup,

09:14.239 --> 09:16.121
then we have Moretti
on theft and murder.

09:16.141 --> 09:18.223
He'll be looking for a buyer.

09:18.243 --> 09:20.352
Which might as well be me.

09:20.373 --> 09:22.461
Joe, Moretti wants you dead.

09:22.481 --> 09:23.929
You sure you can sell this?

09:23.949 --> 09:27.026
As long as I have you and
Chicago's finest backing me up.

09:27.047 --> 09:28.434
But there is one little thing.

09:28.455 --> 09:30.349
- Course. Here it comes.
- I can't go anywhere

09:30.369 --> 09:32.237
near Moretti without
offering him something.

09:32.257 --> 09:35.507
And I think maybe, what, 25
grand ought to do the trick.

09:35.527 --> 09:37.076
There it is. I'm
surprised he didn't shoot

09:37.096 --> 09:39.211
a little bit higher
though. 50, 100, maybe?

09:39.231 --> 09:40.579
Hey, do you want the key to my Rolls?

09:40.599 --> 09:42.648
Son, you just heard the detective say

09:42.668 --> 09:43.816
Leo wants to kill me.

09:43.836 --> 09:45.084
Now, what do you propose,

09:45.104 --> 09:46.885
I walk in there with a
big target on my chest?

09:46.905 --> 09:48.887
Okay, look, we could take
it out of the 1505 fund,

09:48.907 --> 09:50.689
but it's gonna take weeks to approve.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.758
And Moretti's gonna want
to move these rocks soon.

09:52.778 --> 09:54.460
No, no, I'll put up the cash.

09:54.480 --> 09:56.128
It's my money he wants anyway.

09:56.148 --> 09:58.597
Wow, you think
that I want to steal from you?

09:58.617 --> 10:00.499
Guys, just give it up already.

10:00.519 --> 10:01.934
Gideon, you'll get it back.

10:01.954 --> 10:03.802
We'll inventory and track the bills.

10:03.822 --> 10:06.138
That's not the only thing we'll track.

10:06.158 --> 10:08.507
<i>With all due respect, Gideon,</i>

10:08.527 --> 10:10.476
your father cannot wear this.

10:10.496 --> 10:12.644
He might as well walk in there wearing

10:12.664 --> 10:14.747
an "I'm with the cops" T-shirt.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.715
So shrink it.

10:16.735 --> 10:18.751
Ankle monitors are big for a reason.

10:18.771 --> 10:20.085
The tracking equipment,

10:20.105 --> 10:22.154
the security stuff so
people can't take 'em off.

10:22.174 --> 10:23.622
And we need GPS monitoring.

10:23.642 --> 10:25.591
That's only gonna make it bigger.

10:25.611 --> 10:27.059
A few years ago,

10:27.079 --> 10:29.395
I made a tracker for
the electronics division.

10:29.415 --> 10:31.730
It was for extreme mountain climbers.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.899
I was dating one at the time.

10:33.919 --> 10:35.434
Oh, calves like marble.

10:35.454 --> 10:36.568
Anyway, it was pea-sized,

10:36.588 --> 10:38.270
trackable through an avalanche.

10:38.290 --> 10:41.106
All right, fine. But we're still
gonna need an unbreakable band.

10:41.126 --> 10:42.374
Even titanium would snap...

10:42.394 --> 10:45.344
Carbon nanotubes.

10:45.364 --> 10:47.379
At $50,000 a strand?

10:47.399 --> 10:49.948
You're talking about spending

10:49.968 --> 10:52.445
half a million bucks
to protect 25 grand.

10:52.466 --> 10:53.819
It's the principle of the thing!

10:53.839 --> 10:56.455
He's got an old watch
that he likes to wear.

10:56.475 --> 10:57.723
We can make a replica.

10:57.743 --> 11:00.125
We? You mean me.

11:00.145 --> 11:02.979
God, it's like you read my mind.

11:08.787 --> 11:11.203
Chicago Police! Open up!

11:15.127 --> 11:16.675
Hey there.

11:16.695 --> 11:18.143
Uh, is your mom home?

11:18.163 --> 11:20.145
She's at work.

11:20.165 --> 11:22.635
Hey, um, do you know this boy?

11:22.656 --> 11:25.005
We talked to your neighbors;
they said he might live here.

11:25.026 --> 11:27.152
Uh, that's my brother, Luke.

11:27.172 --> 11:29.822
Good. Is, uh, is he
here? Can we talk to him?

11:29.842 --> 11:31.690
Down there.

11:31.710 --> 11:33.926
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

11:33.946 --> 11:36.121
Chicago Police.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.704
Looks like Bat Lady was right.

11:45.724 --> 11:48.674
Kid's got a dismantled
ignition right here,

11:48.694 --> 11:50.476
but where the hell is he?

11:50.496 --> 11:53.993
I don't know. Maybe he didn't
tell his sister he was leaving.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.847
Hey!

11:55.868 --> 11:56.933
There. There he is!

11:57.842 --> 11:59.475
Hey! Stop!

12:00.572 --> 12:02.539
Freeze! Chicago Police!

12:05.477 --> 12:07.043
Stop!

12:09.348 --> 12:10.762
Luke! Stop!

12:13.652 --> 12:16.419
Son of a bitch!

12:31.036 --> 12:33.352
Wow. It looks like the real thing.

12:33.372 --> 12:34.653
Uh-huh.

12:34.673 --> 12:37.055
Except it's not a cheap piece of crap.

12:37.075 --> 12:39.024
You're not gonna be able to get it off.

12:39.044 --> 12:41.059
Ow.

12:41.079 --> 12:43.061
I just hate doing this
without my lucky watch.

12:43.081 --> 12:44.630
You know, you remember,
you gave it to me.

12:44.650 --> 12:46.698
I gave it I back to
you after you stole it

12:46.718 --> 12:48.232
and said it was my graduation gift.

12:48.253 --> 12:49.535
You're gonna get it back, okay?

12:49.555 --> 12:50.736
After we bust Moretti.

12:50.756 --> 12:52.404
And the tracker's good.

12:52.424 --> 12:53.906
Traced him right to this van.

12:53.926 --> 12:55.741
Hear that? So wherever you go,

12:55.761 --> 12:57.409
whatever you say,

12:57.429 --> 12:59.745
we're gonna know about it,
so don't do anything stupid.

12:59.765 --> 13:03.916
And we got a tact team ready,
in case we need to go in.

13:03.936 --> 13:05.517
You ready to go?

14:02.560 --> 14:04.943

14:04.963 --> 14:07.030
25,000.

14:09.268 --> 14:11.483
Vincent told you that I was skimming.

14:11.503 --> 14:12.651
Well, in fact,

14:12.671 --> 14:16.321
I was, but I was making
side bets for you, Leo.

14:16.341 --> 14:18.123

you clocked one of my guys and ran off.

14:34.293 --> 14:36.299
Appreciate the dough, but, see,

14:36.320 --> 14:38.577
we got a principle around here that says

16:22.977 --> 16:25.133
- Gideon.
- Hi.

16:25.153 --> 16:26.368
Hey, I'm happy I caught up to you.

16:26.388 --> 16:27.839
Listen, before we do this today,

16:27.860 --> 16:29.537
- I think you really need to talk to...
- Conrad?

16:29.557 --> 16:30.759
I will, don't worry.
I'm gonna talk to him.

16:30.779 --> 16:31.962
I'm talking about your father.

16:31.982 --> 16:34.676
Murphy, normally I value
your wise perspective

16:34.696 --> 16:38.079
and sage advice, but
that is a terrible idea.

16:38.099 --> 16:40.048
He almost died last night;
that doesn't worry you?

16:40.068 --> 16:41.282
Trust me, this is not

16:41.302 --> 16:43.318
my father's first brush
with a loaded firearm.

16:43.338 --> 16:45.120
Well, maybe he's trying
to redeem himself,

16:45.140 --> 16:47.022
- to really change.
- Uh-huh, right, right.

16:47.042 --> 16:50.225
Like the greengrocer redemption of 2001,

16:50.245 --> 16:52.761
where I loaned him 20 grand
to start a produce company

16:52.781 --> 16:54.763
that magically became a poker game.

16:54.783 --> 16:55.576
Okay.

16:55.597 --> 16:58.233
Or the great holiday redemption of 2010,

16:58.253 --> 17:00.468
a.k.a. the reason we stopped speaking,

17:00.488 --> 17:03.004
where he roped two of my board
members into a pyramid scheme

17:03.024 --> 17:04.472
at my company Christmas party.

17:04.492 --> 17:07.608
Had to have him thrown out by
a security team in Santa hats!

17:07.628 --> 17:09.611
Okay. I get it. Can
you please listen to me?

17:09.631 --> 17:12.414
Look, back in the day, I had
a cousin, his name was Marco.

17:12.434 --> 17:14.148
We were very close as kids.

17:14.169 --> 17:16.678
- Later on, he started dealing.
- Murphy...

17:16.699 --> 17:20.516
Every time I would see
Marco, we would argue.

17:20.537 --> 17:22.018
I was trying to change him.

17:22.038 --> 17:23.619
And finally, I realized that I couldn't.

17:23.640 --> 17:25.689
I just had to make
peace with who he was.

17:25.709 --> 17:28.325
All right. And you
kumbaya'd it out, I got it.

17:28.345 --> 17:30.360
No. He died. I was too late.

17:30.380 --> 17:33.663
Some banger shot him before
I could even reach out.

17:33.683 --> 17:35.799
C.I. work is really dangerous.

17:35.819 --> 17:37.552
You can lose your father.

17:41.050 --> 17:42.739
I do appreciate your concern.

17:48.798 --> 17:51.292

17:51.313 --> 17:53.150
Technically, that's what bags are for,

17:53.170 --> 17:55.118
to carry things, you know.

17:55.138 --> 17:57.988
What? Fine. I'm gonna take it
to the evidence cage right now.

17:58.008 --> 17:59.589
And then you'll talk to your father?

Let's watch it again.

19:15.476 --> 19:16.757
Yes, please.

19:16.777 --> 19:18.723
Son of a bitch!

19:18.744 --> 19:20.614
Joe just got the
location of tonight's meet

19:20.635 --> 19:22.216
- from Moretti's people.
- Mm-hmm.

19:22.237 --> 19:24.598
It's at a diner on 54th and Ohio.

19:24.618 --> 19:27.067
We're gonna set up a perimeter here.

19:27.087 --> 19:28.402
And everyone gets that they're not

19:28.422 --> 19:30.370
just watching Moretti, right?

19:30.390 --> 19:32.673
I want eyes on my dad at all times.

19:32.693 --> 19:34.741
I get you're worried about his safety.

19:34.761 --> 19:36.710
Yeah, well, I'm worried

19:36.730 --> 19:40.147
he's gonna run like a gazelle
on the Serengeti, yeah.

19:40.167 --> 19:43.550
Well, in any case, we got
the whole block covered.

19:43.570 --> 19:45.052
All right.

19:45.072 --> 19:47.488
Have you made nice with him yet?

19:47.508 --> 19:49.756
What? Oh, come on.

19:49.776 --> 19:51.592
You, too? God.

19:51.612 --> 19:53.427
Who else did Murphy
tell to strong-arm me?

19:53.447 --> 19:55.429
For the record, I think she's right.

19:55.449 --> 19:58.665
You know, me and my pops,

19:58.685 --> 20:00.434
we used to fight like crazy

20:00.454 --> 20:02.436
when I was a kid.

20:02.456 --> 20:04.738
Now we shoot the breeze
at least twice a week.

20:04.758 --> 20:06.940
The man is 93 years old.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.676
Talks about the ladies at the rest home

20:09.696 --> 20:11.242
like he's 60.

20:11.263 --> 20:14.615
Well, if my old man
makes it to the rest home,

20:14.635 --> 20:17.084
the ladies should watch their pearls.

20:17.104 --> 20:19.204
That's all I'm saying.

20:20.507 --> 20:23.290
Fine. I'll talk to him.

20:23.310 --> 20:26.059
Bernie. Have you seen my dad?

20:26.079 --> 20:28.462
- Just left. Went to get a vest.
- Vest?

20:28.482 --> 20:30.936
What's he need a vest for?

20:30.957 --> 20:32.539
I thought it was for your operation.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.232
He said Murphy signed off.

20:36.723 --> 20:38.906
- Cobb?
- Mm-hmm.

20:38.926 --> 20:40.741
I'm looking for our C.I.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.808
You mean your dad?

20:41.828 --> 20:42.910
Well, I got a call from somebody.

20:42.930 --> 20:44.745
They wanted him down
in the basement ASAP

20:44.765 --> 20:46.213
for some new surveillance tech.

20:46.233 --> 20:49.249
Wait. Who specifically called you?

20:49.269 --> 20:52.352
Oh. Uh...

20:52.372 --> 20:55.440
Now that I think about it,
I don't really remember.

20:58.111 --> 20:59.326
You! Hey!

20:59.346 --> 21:01.228
Officer Blond Hair,
open that door, please.

21:01.248 --> 21:02.727
Yes, sir.

21:08.177 --> 21:09.578
Yeah, the money's gone.

21:09.599 --> 21:10.680
The money's gone.

21:10.701 --> 21:13.325
Lock this building down!

21:16.534 --> 21:19.371
Everyone, I need all eyes
looking for Joseph Reeves!

21:19.392 --> 21:20.622
We believe he's
somewhere in the building!

21:20.642 --> 21:23.186
Ada, my dad just bounced
with half a million dollars.

21:23.207 --> 21:24.277
Ping the tracker.

21:24.297 --> 21:26.680
I need it's precise location
down to the millimeter.

21:26.700 --> 21:28.548
Yeah, okay, on it.

21:28.568 --> 21:30.650
Basement floor.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.686
What? Ba...? I-I was just there.

21:32.706 --> 21:34.254
Where in the basement?

21:34.274 --> 21:35.655
Yeah, give me a sec.

21:35.675 --> 21:36.923
Your workshop.

21:36.943 --> 21:38.224
Oh!

21:39.646 --> 21:41.661
Pretty impressive, actually.

21:41.681 --> 21:43.396
I mean, he bypassed the alarm.

21:43.416 --> 21:45.999
He used a battery from one
of the Tasers to connect...

21:46.019 --> 21:47.367
I get it, Pete.

21:47.387 --> 21:49.502
Well, I'm just saying,
from a technical standpoint,

21:49.522 --> 21:51.438
it's incredible.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.406
I can see where you
get your talent from.

21:53.426 --> 21:54.974
Yes, okay, my father's a genius.

21:54.994 --> 21:58.978
He defeated my tracker with
my own damn tools, no less.

21:58.998 --> 22:00.042
How long has it been off?

22:00.063 --> 22:01.815
Uh, it's 20 minutes.

22:01.835 --> 22:04.284
Hey, uh, so I just checked
the security cameras,

22:04.304 --> 22:06.553
and Joe skirted the lock
on the evidence cage.

22:06.573 --> 22:08.288
It's pretty amazing, actually.

22:08.308 --> 22:10.207
- What?
- What about the exterior cameras?

22:10.228 --> 22:11.207
They get anything?

22:11.228 --> 22:13.093
There's a 16-foot lapse in coverage

22:13.113 --> 22:14.861
on the west side of the building.

22:14.881 --> 22:16.896
And that is where he went.

22:16.916 --> 22:18.131
Yeah.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.103
<i>Can she even do that?</i>

22:22.124 --> 22:23.770
Can she show my body-cam footage?

22:23.790 --> 22:25.271
'Cause I'm pretty sure she can't.

22:25.291 --> 22:26.673
Come on, man.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.241
You'd have done the same thing.

22:28.261 --> 22:30.410
Remember when Cobb ate that cockroach?

22:30.430 --> 22:32.112
You rode him for weeks.

22:32.132 --> 22:34.280
Yeah, because I was actually there.

22:35.735 --> 22:37.016
That was hilarious.

22:37.037 --> 22:38.687
But, you know, this-this was private.

22:38.707 --> 22:40.889
1305, looks like
we've located your suspect.

22:40.909 --> 22:42.157
Stolen vehicle report.

22:42.177 --> 22:45.627
Headed East on 85th off Crestview.

22:45.647 --> 22:47.893
Copy, Squad. Look at that.

22:47.914 --> 22:50.196
Look's like she's making
it up to you already.

22:50.216 --> 22:51.798
Let's get this little bastard.

23:22.282 --> 23:23.663
Uh-uh, buddy. I got you.

23:29.155 --> 23:30.537
Hands up!

23:30.557 --> 23:32.233
Out of the car!

23:32.254 --> 23:34.170
Luke, get out of the car!

23:41.267 --> 23:43.650
Is that the 2016 or 2017?

23:43.670 --> 23:44.709
What?!

23:44.730 --> 23:47.954
Production on the Cadillac
CTS-V began in 2004.

23:47.974 --> 23:49.923
Supercharged V8 engine,

23:49.943 --> 23:52.492
640 horsepower, top speed
of 200 miles per hour.

23:52.512 --> 23:55.128
Does that one have the
magnesium paddle shifters?

23:55.148 --> 23:57.430
What is up with this kid?

23:57.450 --> 23:58.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:58.618 --> 24:00.084
Hey. Hey, put your hands up!

24:01.018 --> 24:02.654
Kid, stop!

24:03.990 --> 24:05.405
Yeah.

24:05.425 --> 24:07.474
It's got the paddle
shifters. It's an eight-speed.

24:07.494 --> 24:09.175
3.7 seconds, zero to 60.

24:09.195 --> 24:11.829
Do have any idea how
much trouble you're in?

24:13.066 --> 24:15.181
Hey, hey, Brandt, hold on a sec.

24:15.201 --> 24:17.484
Hey, Luke, you go to school?

24:17.504 --> 24:19.819
Yeah? What school you go to?

24:19.839 --> 24:23.823
I used to go to Multiview,
but now I go to Sunshine.

24:23.843 --> 24:26.045
What the hell difference does
it make what school he goes to?

24:26.065 --> 24:29.496
Sunshine is a school for kids
with developmental disabilities.

24:29.516 --> 24:30.463
Autism,

24:30.483 --> 24:31.498
stuff like that.

24:31.518 --> 24:33.033
My cousin's kid goes there.

24:33.053 --> 24:35.201
So he's like Rain Man?

24:35.221 --> 24:37.437
Would you just shut up?

24:37.457 --> 24:39.005
Hey, Luke,

24:39.025 --> 24:41.374
how about this?

24:41.394 --> 24:43.795
What if we let you sit in our car?

24:45.410 --> 24:47.358
Can you answer a few questions for us?

24:47.379 --> 24:50.583
Okay.

24:50.603 --> 24:52.652
This is so cool.

24:52.672 --> 24:54.187
Why'd you run?

24:54.207 --> 24:56.456
You were gonna take the car away,

24:56.476 --> 24:58.558
but the lady... she never washed it.

24:58.578 --> 24:59.993
She used the wrong oil.

25:00.013 --> 25:02.295
But that car didn't belong to you.

25:02.315 --> 25:05.565
I needed it, for my collection.

25:05.585 --> 25:06.666
What collection?

25:06.686 --> 25:10.303
American cars from 1965 to 2005.

25:10.323 --> 25:12.238
Okay.

25:12.258 --> 25:13.807
Can we see your collection?

25:13.827 --> 25:16.042
Mm-mm.

25:16.062 --> 25:18.878
Okay, uh...

25:18.898 --> 25:20.880
how's this, kid?

25:20.900 --> 25:22.048
How about, um,

25:22.068 --> 25:26.319
we let you drive us to
the collection in our car?

25:26.339 --> 25:27.520
Wait. What?

25:27.540 --> 25:29.089
Okay. Yeah.

25:29.109 --> 25:30.724
Are you crazy?

25:30.744 --> 25:32.559
We can't let this kid drive the car.

25:32.579 --> 25:34.627
Hey, he's about to drive us

25:34.647 --> 25:37.363
to God knows how many
counts of felony auto theft.

25:37.383 --> 25:40.667
If you got a better idea, I'm all ears.

25:40.687 --> 25:43.436
Otherwise, I call shotgun.

25:43.456 --> 25:45.905
All right, facial recognition

25:45.925 --> 25:47.640
running at DuPage and Midway airports.

25:47.660 --> 25:49.209
Where's the O'Hare feed?

25:49.229 --> 25:51.277
- I'm not in the system yet.
- Why not?

25:51.297 --> 25:52.912
Because this is
technically illegal, Gideon!

25:52.932 --> 25:55.081
We need FAA approval to even get access

25:55.101 --> 25:56.149
- to these cameras.
- Please!

25:56.169 --> 25:57.751
My dad would be on one of those planes

25:57.771 --> 25:59.152
before we even pick up the phone.

25:59.172 --> 26:00.887
- Get the O'Hare feed online.
- Gideon?

26:00.907 --> 26:02.889
What? What? Hey, hey,
any APB hits on Joe?

26:02.909 --> 26:04.824
No, but I am working my local contacts.

26:04.844 --> 26:09.262
Local? Murphy, my father
has 500,000 of my dollars

26:09.282 --> 26:10.497
in his possession.

26:10.517 --> 26:11.865
Trust me, he's leaving town.

26:11.885 --> 26:13.566
Ada, pull up Union Station.

26:13.586 --> 26:15.102
Gideon, you
have to listen to me.

26:15.122 --> 26:17.873
- You're going about this all wrong.
- Scratch that. Scratch that.

26:17.893 --> 26:20.308
I'm gonna work on the drone,
you look at O'Hare still.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.875
Gideon, please.

26:21.895 --> 26:23.409
I know you want to catch your dad,

26:23.429 --> 26:25.712
but you have got to stop
thinking of Joe as your father

26:25.732 --> 26:27.247
and start thinking of him as a criminal.

26:27.267 --> 26:28.802
What the hell does that even mean?

26:28.823 --> 26:31.117
Criminals don't just up
and leave their home base,

26:31.137 --> 26:33.620
what they know the best;
and for Joe, that's Chicago.

26:33.640 --> 26:35.121
I think he's still here.

26:35.141 --> 26:36.389
Oh, right, where he's wanted

26:36.409 --> 26:38.644
by both police and a murderous gangster.

26:38.665 --> 26:39.746
That's my point.

26:39.767 --> 26:42.896
Joe doesn't care about
cops, but he knows

26:42.916 --> 26:44.898
that if he burns
Moretti, he's a dead man.

26:44.918 --> 26:46.966
So you think that he's still
gonna try to do this deal?

26:46.986 --> 26:48.001
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

26:48.021 --> 26:50.036
'Cause if Joe does this deal,

26:50.056 --> 26:53.206
he walks away with
500 grand in diamonds,

26:53.226 --> 26:55.208
and he stops Moretti from hunting him

26:55.228 --> 26:57.477
for the rest of his life.
Now, the only problem is

26:57.497 --> 26:59.512
we don't know where the new location is.

26:59.532 --> 27:02.182
And, obviously, your father's
not gonna go back to the diner.

27:02.202 --> 27:04.050
We know where Moretti is.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.885
Follow him

27:05.905 --> 27:07.854
to the new location, to my dad.

27:07.874 --> 27:09.856
Moretti's impossible to follow.

27:09.876 --> 27:12.559
When there's something going
on this big, like this deal,

27:12.579 --> 27:15.461
he is very careful, and I'm
talking about multiple cars,

27:15.481 --> 27:17.764
heat moves, countersurveillance.

27:17.784 --> 27:20.500
If any of his guys see a car follow him,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.101
forget it, deal's off.

27:22.121 --> 27:24.170
Then we'll follow all the cars

27:24.190 --> 27:26.406
with something he can't see.

27:29.596 --> 27:32.396
Not bad. Not bad at all.

27:36.894 --> 27:39.699
I added the range extenders
and the extra batteries,

27:39.719 --> 27:41.634
but the controls are
a little bit different

27:41.654 --> 27:42.902
than the regular drone,

27:42.922 --> 27:44.938
so I figure if you train me and Ada...

27:44.958 --> 27:46.706
No, no, no, no, no, no time for that.

27:46.726 --> 27:49.742
So you just put all these
controls into one panel.

27:49.762 --> 27:51.578
- See? Like that.
- Yeah, but you...

27:51.598 --> 27:53.112
What? What? I can handle it.

27:53.132 --> 27:55.114
Gideon, there are four drones.

27:55.134 --> 27:57.016
I have ten fingers.
He's my dad, all right?

27:57.036 --> 27:59.285
I will catch him.

27:59.305 --> 28:00.404
Mm-hmm.

28:04.377 --> 28:06.392
Mm-hmm. See that?

28:06.412 --> 28:07.678
Just like juggling.

28:12.116 --> 28:13.431
Okay.

28:13.451 --> 28:16.157
- Yeah, told you. Easy-peasy.
- Mm-hmm.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.070
Yeah,

28:19.090 --> 28:20.771
just keep in mind,
they're still fragile.

28:30.801 --> 28:33.869
Yeah, okay, well, you
know, I'll practice.

28:37.112 --> 28:38.311
Whoa.

28:39.271 --> 28:41.137
"Whoa" is right.

28:42.301 --> 28:45.096
This is gonna put this kid
away for, like, 30 years.

28:45.116 --> 28:47.331
Think you really want to do that?

28:47.351 --> 28:48.599
It's not our call.

28:48.619 --> 28:50.534
I mean, I bet you half of these

28:50.554 --> 28:52.203
aren't even from the 13th.

28:52.223 --> 28:54.705
I mean, either way you put
it, the kid's going away.

28:54.725 --> 28:56.807
Excuse me. I got a call
that you have my son.

28:56.827 --> 28:58.109
You're Luke's mom?

28:58.129 --> 28:59.910
We been trying to reach
you since yesterday.

28:59.930 --> 29:01.746
I'm sorry. I missed the calls.

29:01.766 --> 29:03.280
I-I work three jobs.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.949
What is going on?

29:04.969 --> 29:07.351
Ma'am, you see these cars?

29:07.371 --> 29:09.286
Your son stole 'em.

29:09.306 --> 29:11.756
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:11.776 --> 29:13.991
He confessed. He calls
'em his collection.

29:14.011 --> 29:15.444
Oh, God.

29:17.314 --> 29:19.330
I knew he liked cars, but...

29:19.350 --> 29:21.632
I had no idea.

29:21.652 --> 29:22.900
You have to understand,

29:22.920 --> 29:25.036
- he's-he's not like other kids.
- I know.

29:25.056 --> 29:26.604
I called his school.

29:26.624 --> 29:28.522
So then you got to
realize, he didn't know that

29:28.543 --> 29:31.208
- what he was doing was wrong.
- We understand, ma'am,

29:31.228 --> 29:32.343
but, um, I-I just doubt

29:32.363 --> 29:34.720
a prosecutor's gonna see it that way.

29:34.741 --> 29:36.580
Prosecutor?

29:36.600 --> 29:38.006
Yeah.

29:38.027 --> 29:40.718
He can't go to jail.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.771
It'll kill him.

29:44.742 --> 29:46.857
Please, I am begging you.

29:46.877 --> 29:48.192
Please don't do this.

29:48.212 --> 29:49.527
Hey, Luke?

29:49.547 --> 29:51.062
Hey, is there

29:51.082 --> 29:52.663
any car you can't steal?

29:52.683 --> 29:54.665
Uh... collect?

29:54.685 --> 29:56.967
No. Some cars are harder.

29:56.987 --> 29:58.854
Keyless cars are hard, but I, um...

29:58.856 --> 30:00.838
I figured out a way to trick the...

30:00.858 --> 30:03.507
Yeah. I don't need the details.

30:03.527 --> 30:05.042
Hey, Mom.

30:05.062 --> 30:07.311
Hi, baby.

30:07.331 --> 30:10.881
Hey, you know that car theft
class they teach at the garage?

30:10.901 --> 30:12.216
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

30:12.236 --> 30:15.304
I'm thinking Luke's
skills might be valuable.

30:18.242 --> 30:20.391
I got a friend over
at the A.S.A.'s office.

30:20.411 --> 30:22.159
Could give a call.

30:22.179 --> 30:23.627
What you think?

30:23.647 --> 30:28.750
I think it would be one hell of a bust.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.058
Make the call.

30:41.198 --> 30:43.347
<i>What are you
doing here exactly?</i>

30:43.367 --> 30:45.282
Pretty simple.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.917
Moretti's in the strip club, there.

30:46.937 --> 30:49.520
When he leaves to do
the deal, he's gonna send

30:49.540 --> 30:52.223
a bunch of cars out, and I'm
gonna follow them with these.

30:52.243 --> 30:53.924
And you're gonna control
these by yourself?

30:53.944 --> 30:56.727
Sending the micros

30:56.747 --> 30:58.295
over to you now, Murphy.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.831
Copy that.

31:05.589 --> 31:07.372
- Cute.
- Cute?!

31:07.393 --> 31:08.309
They're not cute.

31:08.330 --> 31:10.207
They're powerful
instruments of espionage.

31:10.227 --> 31:11.475
Whatever.

31:11.495 --> 31:12.610
As long as they're fast.

31:12.630 --> 31:14.278
Moretti will be leaving any second.

31:14.298 --> 31:15.746
Are you sure you can do this?

31:15.766 --> 31:17.515
Yes, yes, yes. I can and I will.

31:17.535 --> 31:19.801
Please, everybody, stop
asking that question.

31:24.441 --> 31:26.357
This is it. They're on the move.

31:26.377 --> 31:28.192
First car's heading

31:28.212 --> 31:30.394
south on Ohio, the second
car's heading north.

31:30.414 --> 31:32.548
Copy that.

31:33.951 --> 31:35.751
Okay, piece of cake.

31:38.556 --> 31:39.721
A third car's coming out.

31:41.225 --> 31:43.674
Someone keep eyes on that one, please.

31:43.694 --> 31:44.842
It took a left on 26th.

31:44.862 --> 31:46.544
Please don't let there be a fourth car.

31:46.564 --> 31:47.578
Why?

31:47.598 --> 31:48.846
Three is his magic number.

31:48.866 --> 31:50.447
- Dude, I can hear you.
- Yeah, well...

31:50.467 --> 31:51.849
Okay, we've got a fourth car.

31:51.869 --> 31:52.783
Damn it!

31:52.804 --> 31:53.951
Give me one second.

31:53.971 --> 31:55.352
Maybe we should get some follow cars

31:55.372 --> 31:56.720
- out on the road.
- Absolutely not.

31:56.741 --> 31:57.681
I almost got it.

31:57.702 --> 31:58.970
Wait, where did four go?

31:58.991 --> 31:59.931
I don't see it.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.559
Number three is locked. Where's four?

32:02.580 --> 32:03.645
We lost eyes on it.

32:07.109 --> 32:08.183
There.

32:15.059 --> 32:16.574
<i>We are now</i>

32:16.594 --> 32:18.742
trailing all four cars.

32:18.762 --> 32:20.177
Nice work.

32:20.197 --> 32:21.345
So far.

32:23.567 --> 32:24.515
Oh, whoa!

32:24.535 --> 32:25.583
Gideon, be careful.

32:25.603 --> 32:26.717
I am, I am.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.655
I'm going four different
directions here.

32:28.676 --> 32:31.871
Ada, can you pull anything
based on their driving patterns?

32:31.892 --> 32:33.724
Yeah. Yeah, a couple of the cars

32:33.744 --> 32:36.152
- are just driving in circles.
- Doesn't tell us anything.

32:36.172 --> 32:38.494
Just means they're trying
to throw off any follow cars.

32:38.515 --> 32:40.264
Whoa, whoa, Pete!

32:40.284 --> 32:41.657
The signals are shaky!

32:41.678 --> 32:43.434
Why are the signals getting shaky?

32:43.454 --> 32:45.135
'Cause they're not designed for this.

32:45.155 --> 32:47.972
Their signal can't handle four cars

32:47.992 --> 32:48.939
over five square miles.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.307
We got to weed out the decoys.

32:50.327 --> 32:51.742
Anyone see anything in those cars

32:51.762 --> 32:53.510
<i>- resembling Moretti?</i>
<i>- I'm trying,</i>

32:53.530 --> 32:55.045
<i>but the back windows are too tinted.</i>

33:03.459 --> 33:05.726
Ada, punch in on the second car.

33:08.379 --> 33:09.927
Moretti's in car number two.

33:09.947 --> 33:11.929
- What? How do you know that?
- The driver.

33:11.949 --> 33:13.430
They all have drivers.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.832
He looks nervous, okay?

33:14.852 --> 33:17.067
You don't look stiff like
that if you're just a decoy.

33:17.087 --> 33:18.969
You look like that if
the boss is in the car.

33:18.989 --> 33:20.404
That sounds pretty unscientific.

33:20.424 --> 33:23.007
I don't care how it sounds. We
need to make a decision here,

33:23.027 --> 33:25.527
and I've followed a hell of
a lot more bad guys than you.

33:28.232 --> 33:29.747
Fine. Number two it is.

33:29.767 --> 33:32.567
Pete, I'm losing the rest.

33:47.051 --> 33:49.284
♪ ♪

34:10.366 --> 34:12.148
<i>Suspect is in place.</i>

34:13.243 --> 34:14.757
Nice work, Detective.

34:14.777 --> 34:16.960
Save the props
until we make an arrest.

34:16.981 --> 34:18.818
It's not over till we
bring this guy down.

34:25.426 --> 34:27.408
<i>My father used to sneak me</i>

34:27.429 --> 34:28.985
into the zoo when I was a kid.

34:29.005 --> 34:31.554
Now, he knows that place
like the back of his hand.

34:32.014 --> 34:33.453
All right, we're in position.

34:33.862 --> 34:34.911
Any sign of Joe?

34:34.931 --> 34:36.913
No. Still M.I.A.

34:36.933 --> 34:38.915
Starting to think this is maybe just

34:38.935 --> 34:42.952
my father's parting "screw you"
to a guy who wants to kill him.

34:42.972 --> 34:44.453
Joe's too smart to poke the bear.

34:44.473 --> 34:45.521
Trust me, he'll show.

34:45.541 --> 34:46.922
Uh-huh. And then if he doesn't,

34:46.943 --> 34:48.524
can we still get Moretti on intent?

34:48.543 --> 34:49.891
It'll never stick.

34:49.911 --> 34:52.360
We need to see him take the
money and hand off the diamonds.

34:52.380 --> 34:53.663
Great.

34:53.683 --> 34:55.764
So it all hinges on my missing father.

34:55.784 --> 34:57.800
Geez, just like every
day of my childhood.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.969
This S.O.B. doesn't show up,

34:59.989 --> 35:01.337
I'm gonna kill him.

35:01.357 --> 35:04.006
Hell, I might kill him
even if he does show up.

35:04.026 --> 35:05.852
Screw this. Let's go.

35:05.873 --> 35:07.376
It's colder than hell out here.

35:07.396 --> 35:08.204
All right,

35:08.225 --> 35:09.645
Moretti's calling it. Told you.

35:09.665 --> 35:11.147
- Gideon?
- Once again,

35:11.167 --> 35:13.516
my father has managed
to screw everybody.

35:13.536 --> 35:14.717
He's here.

35:25.181 --> 35:27.229
Holy crap. You were right.

35:27.249 --> 35:28.497
Don't act so surprised.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.733
All right, once they make the exchange,

35:30.753 --> 35:32.019
we move in.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.547
Go check the back.

35:44.567 --> 35:47.516
Change the place on me,

35:47.536 --> 35:48.684
now you're late?

35:48.704 --> 35:50.553
Relax, Leo. Relax.

35:50.573 --> 35:53.189
Just trying to be careful,
for your sake as well as mine.

35:53.209 --> 35:55.424
The night guard here...
He's an old pal of mine.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.860
Besides, what I got in here

35:57.880 --> 36:00.162
is well worth waiting for, okay?

36:00.182 --> 36:01.497
400 G's.

36:01.517 --> 36:03.532
400? I said five.

36:03.552 --> 36:04.800
Five?

36:04.820 --> 36:08.337
No. Originally, we said three.

36:08.357 --> 36:10.906
Is he actually trying
to rip Moretti off now?

36:10.926 --> 36:12.475
No, you said
three. I said five.

36:12.495 --> 36:14.443
And I also told you
what I would do to you

36:14.463 --> 36:16.045
- if you tried to screw me on this.
- Whoa.

36:16.065 --> 36:18.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, now. Whoa.

36:18.067 --> 36:19.448
Gideon, if he doesn't lower that gun,

36:19.468 --> 36:20.549
we have to move in.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.385
All right. Here's the thing, Leo.

36:22.405 --> 36:25.521
The Israelis... They only brought three.

36:25.541 --> 36:27.757
But there's an extra 100 grand in here,

36:27.777 --> 36:28.891
and that's from me.

36:28.911 --> 36:31.260
They told me that
they would pay me back.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.529
You and I both know I'll
never see that money again,

36:33.549 --> 36:37.533
but I wanted to deliver
as much as I could for you.

36:37.553 --> 36:39.498
All right?

36:39.519 --> 36:41.570
So you got two choices.

36:41.590 --> 36:43.406
We do the deal for 400,

36:43.426 --> 36:45.541
which is more than
those rocks are worth,

36:45.561 --> 36:48.544
or you go ahead and shoot me.

36:48.564 --> 36:49.930
Kill me. Take everything.

36:53.892 --> 36:56.152
You're gonna have to deal
with the Israelis, though.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.287
- I can handle anyone.
- Sure, you can.

36:58.307 --> 36:59.522
Of course you can.

36:59.542 --> 37:00.623
But I know these guys,

37:00.643 --> 37:03.359
and it could get really, really messy.

37:03.379 --> 37:04.760
All right? Besides,

37:04.780 --> 37:07.047
you're a big businessman,
you got a lot on your plate.

37:08.521 --> 37:11.300
I mean, that's a lot of hassle
for a measly hundred grand.

37:11.320 --> 37:12.301
Damn.

37:12.321 --> 37:13.936
- He's good.
- Oh, no, no, no.

37:13.956 --> 37:17.191
My dad is the Picasso of BS.

37:21.831 --> 37:23.946
Okay. 400.

37:23.966 --> 37:26.682
But you and I are finished.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.785
I don't give a crap how smart you are.

37:29.805 --> 37:31.220
Moretti's in. Murphy,

37:31.240 --> 37:32.888
- get ready.
- I get it.

37:32.908 --> 37:34.590
Sorry it had to turn out like this.

37:34.610 --> 37:35.858
I see the diamonds.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.544
The money.

37:38.981 --> 37:40.963
Murphy, now!

37:40.983 --> 37:43.283
CPD! Drop your weapons!

37:45.387 --> 37:46.802
You lying piece of...

37:47.923 --> 37:50.372
Chicago police! Stop!

37:50.392 --> 37:52.259
Freeze!

37:53.796 --> 37:55.344
Stop right there!

37:55.364 --> 37:56.830
Drop your weapon.

37:59.468 --> 38:01.468
Hands in the air!

38:04.206 --> 38:06.607
I got you, big guy.
Come here. Come here!

38:09.812 --> 38:11.827
Leo Moretti, you're under arrest!

38:11.847 --> 38:13.929
- Finally. Stay on the ground.
- Hold on.

38:13.949 --> 38:15.464
Hold on. Hold on. Where is he?

38:15.484 --> 38:16.932
Murphy, Murphy, where's my father?!

38:16.952 --> 38:19.301
Does anybody have eyes on Joe?

38:19.321 --> 38:21.581
Negative.

38:21.602 --> 38:23.705
Nothing here.

38:23.726 --> 38:25.174
Okay, okay. Wait.

38:25.194 --> 38:27.579
One second. He's got to be
here. He's got to be here.

38:27.600 --> 38:28.511
He's here.

38:28.531 --> 38:29.812
He's...

38:29.832 --> 38:31.298
I...

38:32.902 --> 38:33.883
I...

38:33.903 --> 38:35.135
Damn it!

38:45.614 --> 38:46.652
Morning.

38:48.250 --> 38:50.399
Uh...

38:50.419 --> 38:52.434
That's a weird expression, isn't it?

38:52.454 --> 38:54.904
I never know whether it means
you're having a good morning

38:54.924 --> 38:56.438
or you wish that the other person's

38:56.458 --> 38:58.674
having a good morning. You okay?

38:58.694 --> 39:00.242
Yeah, I'm okay. Why wouldn't I be?

39:00.262 --> 39:01.677
Caught a major criminal yesterday.

39:01.697 --> 39:03.045
Only cost me a hundred grand

39:03.065 --> 39:05.181
and being humiliated by my father

39:05.201 --> 39:06.882
for the millionth time.

39:06.902 --> 39:09.151
I'm so sorry that we let Joe get away.

39:09.171 --> 39:11.253
I mean, I...

39:11.273 --> 39:13.022
You know what?
There's no excuse.

39:13.042 --> 39:14.990
Don't. No. That's...
Don't beat yourself up.

39:15.010 --> 39:16.926
That's what he does.

39:16.946 --> 39:18.694
He disappears. Done it my whole life.

39:18.714 --> 39:21.997
Just like David Copperfield,
without the money.

39:23.504 --> 39:24.466
You gonna be all right?

39:24.486 --> 39:25.935
Yeah.

39:25.955 --> 39:27.369
I'll be fine.

39:27.389 --> 39:31.507
I'm gonna get some air, call
my driver, go for a ride.

39:31.527 --> 39:33.742
Don't.

39:33.762 --> 39:35.177
I'll take you.

39:35.197 --> 39:36.345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:36.365 --> 39:38.247
I'd like that.

39:39.368 --> 39:41.317
- This one is the...
- 2017.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.485
Naturally aspirated. All-wheel drive.

39:43.505 --> 39:44.720
Seven-speed automatic.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.021
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

39:46.041 --> 39:47.790
All that matters to
me is that this model's

39:47.810 --> 39:49.325
supposed to be impossible to break...

39:50.646 --> 39:52.661
...into.

39:52.681 --> 39:53.696
Holy hell.

39:53.716 --> 39:55.330
Told you he was good.

39:55.351 --> 39:56.465
And he can fix them, too.

39:56.486 --> 39:58.035
Yeah, cars went
back to their owners

39:58.055 --> 39:59.605
in better shape than when he took them.

39:59.625 --> 40:01.537
- How long do we have him?
- 36 months.

40:01.557 --> 40:02.838
Every day after school.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.306
Then can I hire him full-time?

40:04.326 --> 40:06.126
If you know what's good for you.

40:08.163 --> 40:10.412
You seriously grew up here?

40:10.432 --> 40:12.848
I thought it would be bigger.

40:15.137 --> 40:17.987
Well...

40:18.007 --> 40:19.788
my dad was a con artist.

40:19.808 --> 40:22.825
Makes it kind of hard
to get a mortgage, so...

40:22.845 --> 40:24.093
Is your mom still here?

40:24.113 --> 40:27.730
Uh, she passed away when
I was in high school.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.899
Gideon, I'm sorry to hear that.

40:29.919 --> 40:32.134
No, it was a long time ago.

40:32.154 --> 40:35.571
Cervical cancer, so...

40:35.591 --> 40:37.740
I remember thinking the
one good thing about it

40:37.760 --> 40:41.728
was, uh, I wouldn't have to
lie to her for my dad anymore.

40:43.198 --> 40:45.147
He... he couldn't
have been all that bad.

40:45.167 --> 40:46.749
He did put you through MIT.

40:48.103 --> 40:50.019
Right, right, right. He put me...

40:50.039 --> 40:51.587
You know how I got through MIT?

40:51.607 --> 40:54.223
Uh, when my mom died,

40:54.243 --> 40:57.493
she wanted her life
insurance to pay my tuition.

40:57.513 --> 41:00.129
- Yeah.
- Instead...

41:00.149 --> 41:03.032
my father blew it on a
sure thing at the track.

41:03.052 --> 41:05.701
And I was so pissed...

41:05.721 --> 41:08.237
that I built a rocket.

41:09.625 --> 41:11.840
To get myself the hell off any planet

41:11.860 --> 41:13.309
that he was living on.

41:13.329 --> 41:14.476
And anyway, I sold it.

41:14.496 --> 41:16.412
That's what paid for college.

41:16.432 --> 41:18.514
Somehow, in my father's twisted logic,

41:18.534 --> 41:21.684
that counts as putting me through MIT.

41:21.704 --> 41:24.887
Look, I know you don't
want to hear this, but,

41:24.907 --> 41:26.255
you know, sometimes,

41:26.275 --> 41:28.791
it's the people that
piss you off the most

41:28.811 --> 41:30.277
that drive you the most.

41:33.031 --> 41:34.919
I think your dad
actually makes you better.

41:34.940 --> 41:37.222
It's kind of a miracle,

41:37.243 --> 41:40.536
actually, you didn't
turn into a con man, too.

41:40.556 --> 41:43.005
Well, who's to say I haven't?

41:43.025 --> 41:45.559
I convinced you I could
run a police station, right?

41:52.601 --> 41:54.550
Hello.

41:54.570 --> 41:56.385
Gideon, it's me.

41:58.473 --> 41:59.221
Where the hell are you?

41:59.241 --> 42:01.657
Look, Gideon, I know you hate
me right now, but come on.

42:01.677 --> 42:04.793
We both knew that I was
gonna do things my way, right?

42:04.813 --> 42:06.195
And you got your diamonds back,

42:06.215 --> 42:08.097
and you got your bad guy, didn't you?

42:08.117 --> 42:10.532
And you got away with a
hundred grand of my money,

42:10.552 --> 42:11.734
so everyone wins, right?

42:11.754 --> 42:13.969
Well, I am never gonna
be father of the year,

42:13.989 --> 42:15.471
but at least I care enough to...

42:15.491 --> 42:16.638
What?

42:16.658 --> 42:18.107
Steal from me?

42:18.127 --> 42:20.142
Embarrass me in front of
an entire police district?

42:20.162 --> 42:21.877
Look, I'm sorry you feel that way, son.

42:21.897 --> 42:23.312
I'm very proud of you, okay,

42:23.332 --> 42:24.947
and everything that you've accomplished.

42:24.967 --> 42:27.616
I know that I'm a screwup, but
I'm never gonna have to regret

42:27.636 --> 42:29.818
the way that you turned
out in spite of me.

42:29.838 --> 42:31.220
You've become a great man.

42:31.240 --> 42:34.556
So, listen, I just want to say...

42:34.576 --> 42:37.459
I love you, son.

42:37.479 --> 42:38.927
I love you.

42:38.947 --> 42:40.514
Very much.
