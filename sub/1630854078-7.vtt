[June] Previously on
The Handmaid's Tale...

00:03.634 --> 00:05.220
[Ezra] For those
who are truly righteous,

00:05.262 --> 00:06.974
He sometimes sends a refuge.

00:07.016 --> 00:09.186
[Serena] The Wheelers
arranged all of this?

00:09.228 --> 00:12.109
[Dr. Landers] Yeah, as soon as
they knew you might be staying.

00:12.151 --> 00:15.324
Isn't it incredible?
It's a full birthing suite.

00:15.365 --> 00:16.618
[Serena] I'm going for a walk.

00:16.660 --> 00:18.121
[Mrs. Wheeler] Absolutely not.

00:18.204 --> 00:20.542
You need to rest.
Your baby needs to rest.

00:20.584 --> 00:22.087
Go to your room.

00:22.129 --> 00:23.674
[sobbing]

00:23.716 --> 00:25.135
Come on, come on.
We can make it.

00:25.177 --> 00:27.348

-[agent] Get him!

00:29.143 --> 00:30.772
[June groaning]

00:31.272 --> 00:32.817
[June] He's not fighting you!

00:32.859 --> 00:34.487
Stop it!
He's not fucking fighting you!

00:36.617 --> 00:39.121
I never gave up hope,

00:39.538 --> 00:41.835
and you never gave up hope,

00:41.877 --> 00:45.885
because we knew that
we would find each other again.

00:45.927 --> 00:47.639
[Mr. Wheeler]
June Osborne was apprehended

00:47.847 --> 00:50.143
by one of my teams
in No Man's Land.

00:50.185 --> 00:51.855
[agent] They don't want him.
Dump 'im.

00:51.897 --> 00:53.149
-No, no, no. No, we stay toge--
-What?

00:53.191 --> 00:54.986
No, no!
Where are you taking him? No!

00:55.028 --> 00:56.406
[Serena]
What's gonna happen to her?

00:56.782 --> 00:59.120
[Mr. Wheeler] I'm going to
send Ezra to No Man's Land

00:59.161 --> 01:00.832
and have him
deal with her there.

01:00.873 --> 01:04.046
[Serena] I want to go with Ezra.
Bear witness.

01:07.094 --> 01:08.764
[breathing raggedly]

01:09.683 --> 01:10.977
Serena, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:11.018 --> 01:12.647
Just drive!

01:36.612 --> 01:38.198
-Where the fuck are we going?
-Just keep driving.

01:38.239 --> 01:40.703
Where? To Toronto? To Gilead?

01:41.830 --> 01:42.707
Is that what you're doing?

01:42.749 --> 01:44.543
So they can
fucking kill me there, Serena?

01:46.172 --> 01:47.174
What about Luke, Serena?

01:47.216 --> 01:48.844
What are those guys
gonna do to him?

01:48.886 --> 01:51.182

-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-You're fuckin' sorry?

02:01.787 --> 02:02.956
Fuck this!

02:03.581 --> 02:05.335
[tires screeching]

02:06.713 --> 02:08.007
[Serena] June.

02:08.049 --> 02:11.389
June, I'm not going
to shoot you.

02:11.890 --> 02:14.311
June, please. June!

[Serena continues groaning]

02:54.935 --> 02:56.605
[June] Jesus.

02:57.147 --> 02:58.901
Are you in fucking labor?

03:02.157 --> 03:03.284
Of course you are.

03:03.326 --> 03:05.623
-[breathing heavily]
-Jesus Christ!

03:05.665 --> 03:08.586
Would you give this to me?
Waving it around.

03:08.629 --> 03:09.631
When did it start?

03:09.673 --> 03:11.718
-I don't know. A while ago.
-Okay.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.054
-Has your water broken?
-Mmm-hmm.

03:13.681 --> 03:15.851
Um, how far apart
are the contractions?

03:15.893 --> 03:17.187
[Serena groaning]

03:17.270 --> 03:19.191
Okay, close.
Do you have a phone?

03:19.233 --> 03:20.861
-No.
-Okay, get out.

03:20.903 --> 03:22.155
-Come on.
-What?

03:22.197 --> 03:23.659
Get out
of the fucking car, please.

03:23.701 --> 03:27.374
Oh, God. Why?
What are you gonna do?

03:27.416 --> 03:29.921
I'm gonna try
to get us out of here. Okay?

03:29.963 --> 03:31.382
Get you to a doctor.

03:31.424 --> 03:32.551
No.

03:32.593 --> 03:35.265
Yes, Serena. You're gonna
have to go to a hospital.

03:35.306 --> 03:37.352
No hospital.
They're gonna find me there.

03:37.394 --> 03:40.024
Who the fuck is gonna find you?

03:40.108 --> 03:41.360
[engine revving]

03:43.573 --> 03:44.533
Fuck!

03:44.909 --> 03:47.539
Oh, my God. Okay.

03:47.581 --> 03:48.416
All right.

03:49.543 --> 03:51.547
Who the fuck was that guy?
Who was that guy you shot?

03:51.590 --> 03:54.136
-[groaning]
-Who was he?

03:54.596 --> 03:57.058
Were you trying
to get away or something?

04:05.408 --> 04:07.537
Okay, all right.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.626
Ugh, fuck.

04:15.512 --> 04:16.973
Okay. Okay.

04:17.015 --> 04:18.059
Come with me.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.353
-We gotta get you inside.
-Where?

04:19.394 --> 04:20.522
We're gonna
take you to that barn.

04:20.563 --> 04:21.733
-A barn?
-Yes, a barn.

04:21.775 --> 04:23.821
-You have a better idea, Serena?
-No. No, no, no.

04:23.862 --> 04:25.783
-Yeah, I didn't think so.
-Okay, wait, wait.

04:25.825 --> 04:27.327
-[breathes deeply]
-Just breathe. Okay.

04:27.369 --> 04:29.414
-There you go. There you go.
-Okay, okay.

04:29.456 --> 04:31.418
All right.
Maybe it'll have a manger, huh?

04:31.460 --> 04:34.132
Oh. Lovely.

04:40.103 --> 04:41.522
Okay.

04:44.863 --> 04:45.781
[Serena continues groaning]

04:52.002 --> 04:53.045
[Serena] Thank you.

04:53.922 --> 04:55.300
I'm so sorry to be late.

04:55.341 --> 04:57.179
Fred needed some encouragement

04:57.220 --> 04:58.891
before his address
to the Council.

05:00.393 --> 05:02.355
You know how men can be.

05:02.439 --> 05:04.694
We understand completely.

05:04.736 --> 05:08.034
May I present to you
our new Handmaid, Offred.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.038
[wife] Blessed be the fruit.

05:10.873 --> 05:12.083
May the Lord open.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.131
[wife] This way.

05:15.256 --> 05:18.554
[Handmaids] Push, push, push.

05:20.308 --> 05:21.435
[Handmaid groaning]

05:21.477 --> 05:25.778
[Handmaids]
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

05:27.280 --> 05:31.205
Push, push, push.

05:32.082 --> 05:36.340
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

05:36.382 --> 05:38.010
Blessed day, Mrs. Waterford.

05:38.052 --> 05:41.851
-Blessed day, Aunt Lydia.
-Indeed. The most blessed.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.939
[Handmaids]
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

05:43.981 --> 05:46.736
[Handmaid groaning]

05:46.778 --> 05:50.576
Breathe. And push, push.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.750
Glory be His name.

05:53.834 --> 05:57.633
We have now reached
the most sacred part

05:57.675 --> 05:59.469
of the birthing process,

05:59.511 --> 06:04.647
the one in which God truly makes
His glorious presence known.

06:04.939 --> 06:08.571
This vessel of God is ready

06:08.613 --> 06:13.247
to bring the fruits of His love
into the world.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.961
-[Handmaids] Push.
-[Handmaid groaning]

06:16.003 --> 06:21.096
[Handmaids]
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

06:21.138 --> 06:23.059
[Aunt Lydia]
But the Gates of Heaven

06:23.100 --> 06:25.939
do not open
without extraordinary effort.

06:26.315 --> 06:27.985
Do they, girls?

06:28.027 --> 06:32.077
We must beckon
this new soul forward.

06:32.118 --> 06:34.749
Support your sister
in her labors.

06:34.791 --> 06:38.089
Pray for her strength
and success.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.803
[groaning]

06:40.844 --> 06:45.186
[Handmaids]
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

06:45.228 --> 06:50.446
And push, push, push.

06:50.614 --> 06:55.498
There! Breathe,
breathe, breathe.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.880
-And push! Push!
-[Handmaids] Push.

06:58.922 --> 07:01.260
Breathe, breathe.

07:02.303 --> 07:04.600
-Come on, breathe.
-[Serena groaning]

07:05.101 --> 07:07.480
-Breathe.
-[groans]

07:07.940 --> 07:09.442
There you go.

07:10.444 --> 07:11.823
[Serena gasps]

07:12.867 --> 07:14.452
Was that it?

07:16.248 --> 07:17.668
[scoffs] No.

07:18.169 --> 07:20.339
[Serena breathing unsteadily]

07:29.859 --> 07:31.236
[Serena] It's so cold.

07:31.946 --> 07:33.574
[June] Yeah,
it's just gonna get colder.

07:41.340 --> 07:42.927
It can be like this
with the first one.

07:42.968 --> 07:45.641
I was in labor with Hannah
for 19 hours,

07:45.682 --> 07:46.893
and she almost broke my pelvis.

07:49.899 --> 07:51.193
[Serena shivering]

07:54.324 --> 07:56.078
Nichole was faster.

07:59.584 --> 08:01.421
Of course that time I was alone.

08:04.469 --> 08:06.390
[shivering]

08:07.392 --> 08:09.814
I remember thinking
that if anything went wrong,

08:12.235 --> 08:13.487
we would die,

08:14.114 --> 08:15.617
and no one would even know.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.669
No one
would come looking for us.

08:23.967 --> 08:26.471
It would be like
we never existed.

08:32.609 --> 08:33.737
[gasping]

08:34.989 --> 08:35.866
[crying]

08:43.422 --> 08:45.259
[continues crying]

08:54.444 --> 08:55.404
Okay.

08:56.031 --> 08:58.494
It's a big one. It's a big one.
I need you to breathe.

08:58.535 --> 09:00.373
-[Serena] I can't.
-Good. Yes, you can.

09:00.414 --> 09:02.836
You can do this.
You have to do this, okay?

09:02.920 --> 09:05.383
-I can't.
-Yes, you can.

09:05.424 --> 09:07.470
Yes, you can. Breathe, Serena.

09:07.846 --> 09:09.767
-[sobbing]
-There you go.

09:10.559 --> 09:12.898
Okay, I need to check something.
All right?

09:12.940 --> 09:14.902
-Check what?
-I need to check the cervix.

09:14.944 --> 09:17.115
I need to check to see
if I can feel the baby's head.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.952
Okay?

09:20.246 --> 09:21.749
[Serena groaning]

09:22.626 --> 09:23.628
Oh, God!

09:24.170 --> 09:25.548
Get away from me.

09:25.590 --> 09:28.137
I am trying to help you, Serena.

09:28.178 --> 09:29.890
You're trying to kill me
and my baby!

09:29.932 --> 09:32.353
-You're going to kill my baby.
-Okay, fine.

09:32.855 --> 09:35.777
You wanna do this on your own?
Do it the fuck alone!

09:39.159 --> 09:41.455
[groaning]

10:06.631 --> 10:08.760
[breathing heavily]

10:39.404 --> 10:41.909
[breathing heavily]

10:46.711 --> 10:48.422
[Handmaid] We're here with you.

10:53.181 --> 10:54.852
[footsteps receding]

11:06.499 --> 11:09.715
Gather close
around your sister, girls.

11:09.757 --> 11:13.055
Be there for Ofclarence
in her time of need.

11:21.571 --> 11:24.620
We will recite
the Prayer of Purification.

11:26.039 --> 11:27.208
[Handmaids] Grant that I may

11:27.291 --> 11:29.922
never cease grieving
because of it.

11:29.964 --> 11:32.009
-[Doctor] She's ready.
-[Handmaids] Never be content...

11:32.051 --> 11:33.553
Of course, do what you must.

11:33.930 --> 11:35.516
-It is God's will.
-[Handmaids] Never think that

11:35.600 --> 11:38.731
I can reach
a point of perfection.

11:46.496 --> 11:47.331
Girls.

12:25.784 --> 12:26.994
Girls.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.127
[Handmaids] Kill my envy,
command my tongue,

12:31.837 --> 12:33.381
trample down self.

12:34.467 --> 12:38.768
Deliver me from attachments
to things unclean.

12:39.435 --> 12:44.112
From wrong associations,
from the sugar of sin.

12:58.891 --> 13:01.772
Offred. Pray.

13:02.899 --> 13:05.279
Pray for the life of the child.

13:12.251 --> 13:13.461
[Handmaids praying indistinctly]

13:32.082 --> 13:34.963
[baby crying]

13:35.130 --> 13:37.384
[breathing heavily]

13:45.150 --> 13:47.029
Okay. Okay.

You came back.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.003
-[Serena groaning]
-[June] Okay.

16:01.005 --> 16:03.259

16:20.252 --> 16:21.797
[Serena] Oh.

-You feel that?
-Uh-huh. [laughs]

16:26.598 --> 16:28.393
[June] I can see his hair.

16:28.434 --> 16:30.982
-[Serena] What color is it?
-It's a little, uh, brownish.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.694
It's-- There's some blood,
but he's coming.

16:32.735 --> 16:34.530
-[Serena groaning]
-[June] He's got brown hair.

16:34.571 --> 16:36.409

[Serena groaning]

16:39.791 --> 16:41.544
Here, we're gonna
get the head out.

[Serena groaning]

16:48.266 --> 16:49.853
Breathe deep.

16:50.562 --> 16:53.443
-Breathe low.
-[groaning]

16:55.781 --> 16:58.453
Nice and low. Low.

17:06.344 --> 17:08.014
Oh, my God, it burns,
it burns, it burns.

17:08.097 --> 17:09.601
I know. I know.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.611
I feel so hot. I'm so hot.

17:14.652 --> 17:16.530
It's okay. You're just tired.

17:16.572 --> 17:18.201
-[groaning]
-That's it.

17:19.662 --> 17:21.833
-I can't. I can't.
-Yes, you can.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.505
Yes, you can. You can do this.
You're almost there, okay?

17:24.881 --> 17:26.760
We just gotta get his head out.

17:26.802 --> 17:29.264
He's right there.
Your baby's right there.

17:31.352 --> 17:34.274
[sobbing]

17:35.068 --> 17:37.447
-[screaming]
-There he is.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.705
His head's out.
You got his head out.

17:41.623 --> 17:43.919
His head's out. Okay?

17:44.169 --> 17:46.633
This is it, okay?
You just gotta do one more.

17:46.675 --> 17:48.846
You gotta get his shoulders out,
all right?

17:48.887 --> 17:51.392
Then it's all downhill
from there, okay?

17:52.185 --> 17:53.897
Okay, you can do this.

17:54.314 --> 17:56.318
Here we go.
You can do this. This is it.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.824
[groaning]

18:16.108 --> 18:17.904
-[laughing]
-[baby crying]

18:18.237 --> 18:20.785
He's here. He's here.

18:26.253 --> 18:27.924
[Serena laughing]

18:39.446 --> 18:41.075
[Serena] Is he okay?

18:45.626 --> 18:46.962
Is he okay?

18:49.341 --> 18:50.636
He's perfect.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.101
He's perfect.

18:54.142 --> 18:59.862
Oh, hello, baby. I'm your mama.

19:00.154 --> 19:01.532
Ah.

19:05.456 --> 19:07.795
[laughs]

19:12.012 --> 19:13.431
Praise be.

19:14.141 --> 19:15.894
[baby continues crying]

19:16.605 --> 19:19.902
Oh, my angel. [shushing]

19:30.674 --> 19:31.926
Praise be.

19:32.344 --> 19:36.060
[Serena]
Oh, I know. You're so...

19:39.817 --> 19:41.863
[Aunt Lydia]
Ofclarence has fulfilled

19:41.905 --> 19:43.867
her duty in this world.

19:45.370 --> 19:47.248
I know
you will mourn her, girls,

19:48.084 --> 19:49.671
but know that she is cherished.

19:51.215 --> 19:56.308
God is the true judge,
and she is His vessel.

19:58.521 --> 19:59.941
She has pleased Him,

20:00.651 --> 20:03.824
and He has sent her
to her final reward.

20:05.284 --> 20:06.705
Praise be.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.249
[Handmaids]
Praise be, Aunt Lydia.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.461
Praise be, Aunt Lydia.

20:11.923 --> 20:16.306
And now, let us
accompany our sister home.

21:25.737 --> 21:27.073
[baby coos]

21:30.706 --> 21:33.419
Little baby.

21:34.504 --> 21:36.593
I'm going to call you Noah.

21:42.395 --> 21:44.232
It's a nice name.

21:45.611 --> 21:47.615
"The savior of humanity."

21:51.079 --> 21:55.129
Baby Noah.
I can't believe you're here.

21:58.260 --> 22:01.851
I waited so long for you.
I wanted you so much.

22:05.149 --> 22:06.986
Was it worth it?

22:14.334 --> 22:17.382
Right now, I think it was.

22:20.304 --> 22:21.891
How's his latch?

22:22.977 --> 22:26.400
-It's strong, and he's hungry.
-Mmm. I bet.

22:30.241 --> 22:32.621
Hannah had
such a hard time breastfeeding.

22:33.665 --> 22:37.547
It was a tongue tie,
which we didn't know.

22:37.798 --> 22:40.846
But I would
just feed her and feed her,

22:40.887 --> 22:44.895
and she was still hungry,
and I felt so guilty.

22:45.479 --> 22:47.400
She used to get so many colds
when she was little,

22:47.442 --> 22:51.283
and I thought that was my fault
because of the nursing.

22:51.784 --> 22:53.412
But then it turned out
she got colds

22:53.454 --> 22:54.957
when she got older too, so...

22:57.420 --> 22:59.967
Sometimes I'd have to stay home
from work with her and...

23:01.261 --> 23:03.307
sometimes I couldn't
stay home from work.

23:05.937 --> 23:08.150
Sometimes I didn't
want to stay home from work.

23:15.247 --> 23:16.458
June.

23:19.339 --> 23:21.134
Why didn't you kill me?

23:29.109 --> 23:29.944
I don't--

23:29.985 --> 23:31.488
You've been the one
waving the gun around.

23:31.530 --> 23:34.035
No, not today,
at the Information Center,

23:34.077 --> 23:35.371
the protest.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.045
You had a gun.

23:40.131 --> 23:41.508
Yeah.

23:44.807 --> 23:48.982
Why didn't you kill me?
Why Fred and not me?

23:58.960 --> 24:00.714
I didn't want to.

24:27.976 --> 24:31.274
[breathing deeply]

24:31.734 --> 24:34.364
I imagined this moment
so many times.

24:35.992 --> 24:39.040
I always imagined
that he would be here.

24:41.086 --> 24:42.631
Fred.

24:45.637 --> 24:47.056
He looks like him.

24:51.356 --> 24:52.693
They...

24:54.655 --> 24:58.537
say that they always
look like their dads at first.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.293
It's evolutionary.

25:02.253 --> 25:05.677
So that the dads
don't kill them, you know?

25:07.513 --> 25:09.142
Evolution?

25:26.384 --> 25:28.180
Do you think
he's gonna be like him?

25:30.392 --> 25:31.604
It depends.

25:32.981 --> 25:34.067
On what?

25:34.818 --> 25:36.446
On who raises him.

25:39.953 --> 25:43.377
On what kind of person
they want him to become.

25:48.553 --> 25:50.391
On what you teach him.

25:55.275 --> 25:57.571
And on what you tell him
is his...

25:59.910 --> 26:01.287
to take.

26:08.845 --> 26:12.226
I want him to have everything.

26:13.228 --> 26:15.608
We all want that
for them, Serena.

26:32.016 --> 26:33.770
[birds calling]

27:09.006 --> 27:11.427
-Oh, is he okay?
-No, he's perfect.

27:15.603 --> 27:17.189
It's funny how

27:18.525 --> 27:21.072
every tiny baby you see
makes you feel like

27:21.114 --> 27:22.617
you've never seen a baby before.

27:23.493 --> 27:25.330
I tried to sleep.

27:26.541 --> 27:27.836
You did sleep.

27:27.877 --> 27:31.594
I just kept worrying
that I would smother him

27:31.635 --> 27:33.471
in these blankets and things.

27:34.098 --> 27:37.229
They're not supposed
to have bedding like this.

27:41.321 --> 27:44.493
We have to get you both
somewhere inside, Serena, okay?

27:45.162 --> 27:46.832
Somewhere where
they can take care of you.

27:46.874 --> 27:47.751
No.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.755
I told you
I can't go to a hospital.

27:49.796 --> 27:51.132
They'll find me there.

27:51.507 --> 27:52.301
Who will find you?

27:52.426 --> 27:53.804
The Wheelers.

27:56.769 --> 27:58.648
The family
that I've been staying with,

27:59.190 --> 28:01.695
they were the ones
looking for you.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.035
They've been controlling me.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.249
My every move.
They're everywhere.

28:09.251 --> 28:12.132
It's like I'm their Handmaid.

28:14.930 --> 28:15.932
It's like I'm you.

28:16.975 --> 28:17.811
[scoffs]

28:19.522 --> 28:21.109
As awful as that sounds--

28:21.150 --> 28:23.823
Yes. Which is why
they can't find me,

28:23.864 --> 28:26.202
and I can't let them
get their hands on my baby.

28:26.244 --> 28:28.540
So you understand.
I know that you do.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.170
Serena, you have no water,
you have no food.

28:31.212 --> 28:33.216
-It's freezing.
-But I'm so hot.

28:33.258 --> 28:35.972
No, I know.
That's because you have a fever.

28:36.013 --> 28:38.602
So we have to get you
the fuck out of this barn

28:38.644 --> 28:41.650
and take you somewhere
where they can take care of you.

28:42.944 --> 28:44.823
Or you are both going to die.

28:45.532 --> 28:47.369
And it will not be quick.

28:47.829 --> 28:50.793
Do you want to watch your baby
slowly starve to death

28:50.835 --> 28:55.427
in front of you
while you die of sepsis?

29:00.187 --> 29:01.314
No.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.501
Maybe you should take him.

29:14.674 --> 29:16.135
What are you talking about?

29:18.389 --> 29:20.227
There's nothing left
for me here.

29:20.268 --> 29:22.272
I can't go to Canada.

29:23.316 --> 29:25.655
I can't go back to Gilead.

29:27.199 --> 29:30.580
It's over.
I don't have a future.

29:33.963 --> 29:36.133
But you have a future.
Maybe you could...

29:38.096 --> 29:39.390
take him with you.

29:39.431 --> 29:41.269
Serena, you, you don't know
what you're saying.

29:41.310 --> 29:42.814
I know that I want
what's best for him,

29:42.856 --> 29:46.404
like what you did with Nichole,
with your daughter.

29:50.078 --> 29:52.792
He would be safe with you.

29:53.084 --> 29:55.046
You could care for him.

29:55.547 --> 29:59.138
You and your husband.
He's a good man.

30:00.725 --> 30:03.104
He could teach Noah
to be a good man.

30:04.774 --> 30:07.321
The kind of man
who would never do the things

30:07.362 --> 30:09.784
that his father did.

30:15.086 --> 30:16.965
The things that I did.

30:25.565 --> 30:26.525
No.

30:26.860 --> 30:29.824
June, I think
God sent you to me today.

30:30.158 --> 30:31.620
You came after me.

30:31.662 --> 30:33.791
What if He guided my hand
to save you,

30:33.832 --> 30:36.587
so that you could save my baby,
like an angel.

30:36.713 --> 30:37.632
Bullshit.

30:37.674 --> 30:39.218
There are avenging angels

30:39.259 --> 30:42.600
that rain down sulfur and fire
from the Lord.

30:44.186 --> 30:47.025
"Rejoice with Him, O heavens,

30:48.486 --> 30:51.242
for He will avenge
the blood of His children

30:52.870 --> 30:56.753
and take righteous vengeance
on His adversaries."

31:00.010 --> 31:02.014
They're still angels.

31:03.016 --> 31:05.646
Maybe that's what
you are for me.

31:11.407 --> 31:13.996
Is that what you think of me?

31:18.046 --> 31:22.220
"And when
she could no longer hide him,

31:22.512 --> 31:25.018
she built for him
an ark of bulrushes

31:25.060 --> 31:28.232
and placed this child therein."

31:33.284 --> 31:35.330
Maybe I'm the ark, June.

31:37.794 --> 31:39.588
Maybe I'm the vessel.

31:44.348 --> 31:45.893
I carried my baby.

31:47.437 --> 31:48.690
I delivered him.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.447
And I held him.

31:56.706 --> 32:00.588
Maybe that's all that was
meant for me in this life.

32:05.348 --> 32:07.310
Maybe it's God's will.

32:19.961 --> 32:22.007
[Noah fusses]

32:50.063 --> 32:51.315
God's will.

33:04.132 --> 33:05.343
A vessel.

33:10.061 --> 33:11.898
That's what you thought I was.

33:16.407 --> 33:17.743
What we were.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.628
Who we were...

33:25.174 --> 33:26.385
where we came from...

33:29.976 --> 33:31.520
what we wanted...

33:36.572 --> 33:38.284
none of that mattered to you.

33:43.377 --> 33:44.839
To any of you.

33:49.514 --> 33:50.976
I'm so sorry.

33:51.018 --> 33:52.980
I don't care that you're sorry.

33:55.652 --> 33:57.322
We mattered.

33:58.157 --> 33:59.576
We were...

34:01.748 --> 34:04.252
We are people.

34:07.258 --> 34:09.012
We have lives.

34:18.824 --> 34:22.205
And that's why
I'm gonna save yours, Serena.

34:25.671 --> 34:28.008
Because this isn't Gilead.

34:30.597 --> 34:32.768
And I am not you.

34:36.734 --> 34:39.657
[sobs] I don't deserve
to be saved.

34:39.782 --> 34:41.243
It's not for you.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.501
It's for him.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.513
Look at him.

34:53.142 --> 34:54.352
Look at your baby.

34:57.066 --> 34:57.943
You are the only person

34:57.985 --> 35:00.198
in the whole world
that he knows.

35:02.327 --> 35:05.041
You are the only familiar smell.

35:05.333 --> 35:08.047
You are the only voice
he recognizes.

35:12.305 --> 35:14.644
You love him.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.156
And you wanted him so much.

35:21.156 --> 35:22.158
[laughs softly]

35:24.956 --> 35:26.793
You're his mother.

35:30.132 --> 35:33.305
And he belongs with you.

35:38.608 --> 35:42.198
That is God's will.

36:01.779 --> 36:03.783
Do you understand me?

36:17.393 --> 36:19.230
Excuse me.
Could you please help us?

36:19.982 --> 36:21.443
-Immediate postpartum?
-[June] Yes.

36:21.526 --> 36:24.115
Um, six hours. Maybe eight.
It's okay.

Page Maternity and NICU.
Let's get fluids in her.

36:25.576 --> 36:26.663
It's gonna be fine.
They'll help you.

36:26.704 --> 36:27.790
Okay? I promise.

36:27.831 --> 36:29.459
It's gonna be all right, Serena.
Okay?

36:29.501 --> 36:31.673
We're going to sit down.
Here we go.

36:31.714 --> 36:34.469
-[nurse 1] Any complications?
-No. They're doing just fine.

36:34.511 --> 36:35.931
-June.
-[June] It's gonna be okay.

36:36.014 --> 36:37.601
Just go with them
and do what they say.

36:37.685 --> 36:38.645
It's gonna be fine.

36:38.687 --> 36:40.649
They're gonna
take care of him, okay?

36:40.691 --> 36:43.070
I'm gonna be right here, okay?
It's gonna be okay.

...use your phone. I'm fine.

Can I just please
use your phone?

-Please.
-Dial nine first.

[knocking on door]

37:21.271 --> 37:22.106
Hi.

37:23.860 --> 37:26.114
They took Noah to the NICU.

37:27.910 --> 37:29.162
That's okay.

37:36.510 --> 37:40.351
Look, you had a fever, right,
so he's fine.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.269
It's standard. They just--

37:41.311 --> 37:43.608
They need to keep an eye on him.

37:43.650 --> 37:46.071
Right. That's what they said.
It's just observation,

37:46.112 --> 37:47.448
except he didn't have a fever.

37:47.490 --> 37:48.868
He just was having trouble

37:48.910 --> 37:51.164
regulating his, um...
His temperature.

37:51.206 --> 37:55.297
And they said, um, that
he might have, uh, jaundice.

37:55.339 --> 37:58.805
But they're not sure
so they have to run some tests.

37:58.847 --> 38:01.101
Yeah, that's all very normal.

38:01.393 --> 38:04.232
That's what they keep saying.
It's just all so, um...

38:05.944 --> 38:07.405
impersonal and...

38:09.075 --> 38:11.873
I don't know. Very... medical.

38:14.502 --> 38:16.548
How are you feeling?

38:19.012 --> 38:20.807
Uh, my fever is down.

38:23.145 --> 38:24.188
They gave me antibiotics.

38:24.230 --> 38:25.482
I guess
they don't trust anything

38:25.524 --> 38:27.278
to resolve naturally here.

38:28.865 --> 38:30.619
They're not letting me feed him.

38:33.373 --> 38:36.756
They're waiting for us both
to be fully hydrated again.

38:36.797 --> 38:39.845
-That's good.
-They're giving him formula.

38:40.346 --> 38:41.891
He'll be fine.

38:44.020 --> 38:45.064
Promise.

38:55.542 --> 38:57.213
I just want to go home.

39:03.016 --> 39:04.895
There is no home, Serena.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.989
There's just wherever you are.

39:15.582 --> 39:17.128
No Man's Land.

39:19.717 --> 39:20.551
Yeah.

39:34.872 --> 39:35.957
June.

39:39.172 --> 39:40.424
Thank you.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.789
You're welcome.

40:36.411 --> 40:37.246
Luke.

40:39.292 --> 40:41.421
You're here.
Moira said they let you go.

40:42.506 --> 40:44.135
[Luke] At the border.

40:50.355 --> 40:51.942
I'm so happy to see your face.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.113
June, we did it.

40:54.447 --> 40:57.662
Tuello's got the USB.
He's working on it.

40:59.248 --> 41:00.668
Oh, thank you.

41:01.211 --> 41:02.923
Oh, thank you.

41:03.883 --> 41:06.137
Are you okay? Did she hurt you?

41:07.473 --> 41:10.647
No. She, she had her baby.

41:11.690 --> 41:13.193
While you were there?

41:13.653 --> 41:14.821
Yeah.

41:14.863 --> 41:16.909
It's, um... It's a boy.

41:16.951 --> 41:19.748
And he's healthy.
Well, healthy enough.

41:20.457 --> 41:22.879
He, he may have jaundice,
but that's...

41:22.921 --> 41:25.551
You know, that's completely
normal for babies, right?

41:25.593 --> 41:28.641
So, they may just put him
under one of those little lamps.

41:28.683 --> 41:31.312
All right. June, June, June.
What's going on with Serena?

41:33.734 --> 41:35.237
She's fine.

41:36.531 --> 41:38.451
She's, she's fine?

41:40.247 --> 41:41.792
Yeah. Let's, um...

41:41.834 --> 41:43.963
I'll tell you later.
Let's go home.

41:44.005 --> 41:45.925
Oh. Hold on. Give me a sec.

41:45.967 --> 41:47.052
[Captain]
Serena Waterford's room?

41:47.344 --> 41:48.973
211. Down the hall.

41:52.146 --> 41:53.273
What's going on?

41:53.315 --> 41:54.818
[indistinct chatter
over police comms]

41:55.193 --> 41:57.699
Don't worry.
They're not here for us.

41:58.868 --> 41:59.995
Come on.

42:00.663 --> 42:01.790
Oh, what's...

42:03.836 --> 42:06.299
[woman speaking indistinctly
over PA system]

42:07.844 --> 42:10.182
Serena Waterford?
We are Canadian Immigration.

42:10.223 --> 42:11.142
You are being detained.

42:12.144 --> 42:13.271
Detained?

42:13.396 --> 42:14.231
[June] Hey!

42:16.904 --> 42:19.533
Um, I'd like to speak
with a lawyer.

42:19.785 --> 42:20.953
[Captain]
As an undocumented person,

42:20.995 --> 42:23.124
you have
no immediate right to counsel.

42:23.166 --> 42:24.795
-Your phone call--
-What is going on?

42:24.878 --> 42:28.426
Illegal border crossing.
Lack of immigration status.

42:28.761 --> 42:29.763
[Serena]
There must be some mistake.

42:29.805 --> 42:31.224
-Please.
-You called them?

42:31.265 --> 42:33.144
She gave up her diplomatic visa

42:33.186 --> 42:35.357
when she left
that little Visitors Center.

42:38.196 --> 42:39.490
What about my baby?

42:41.662 --> 42:44.333
[Captain] The detention facility
has no infant care.

42:58.027 --> 43:00.574
Well, what does that mean?

43:02.369 --> 43:04.415
Where is my baby right now?

43:04.457 --> 43:06.461
The Child Protection Unit
is already here.

43:06.837 --> 43:09.341
They'll oversee his care.
That's all I can tell you.

43:09.383 --> 43:10.887
[sobbing] No, you can't do that.

43:10.970 --> 43:13.601
No, please! Please, wait, wait!

43:13.642 --> 43:15.605
Oh, please, don't take my baby!

43:15.646 --> 43:19.153
At last
she knows what it feels like.

43:19.195 --> 43:21.115
[Serena] Oh, please, stop!

43:21.199 --> 43:24.288
Please! Please!

43:24.873 --> 43:25.792
June!

43:26.375 --> 43:29.633
June, don't let them
take my baby, please!

43:29.716 --> 43:32.346
-[Luke] Justice. Right?
-[Serena] June, help me!

43:32.387 --> 43:34.893
-Right.
-[Serena] Help me, please!

43:35.393 --> 43:37.564
Please don't let them
take him from me!

43:37.607 --> 43:39.193
Please stop!

43:39.527 --> 43:41.949
Please help me!

43:42.825 --> 43:45.121
Please help me, June!

43:45.205 --> 43:47.125
June, do something!

43:48.503 --> 43:50.423
June, please!
