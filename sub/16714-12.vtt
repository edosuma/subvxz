Ow!

00:50.007 --> 00:53.008
Damn it! Mm.

01:17.935 --> 01:20.299
Aah! Aah!

01:20.304 --> 01:23.231
Help! Help me.

01:24.942 --> 01:27.743
So, who's your inspiration?

01:27.803 --> 01:30.121
You wouldn't know him. He's great,

01:30.126 --> 01:31.689
but a bit obscure.

01:31.694 --> 01:33.746
You want to try me?

01:33.751 --> 01:35.120
Trombone Shorty.

01:35.125 --> 01:37.815
Yeah. Yeah, he did some
studio work for Prince.

01:37.820 --> 01:40.886
Ok. So my man knows jazz.

01:40.891 --> 01:43.067
Yeah, I knew Prince a little bit.

01:43.072 --> 01:45.428
Hmm.

01:45.831 --> 01:47.004
This can't be good.

01:47.009 --> 01:48.227
It's not good.

01:48.232 --> 01:50.373
It's not even a teeny tiny bit good.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.248
Isn't Spencer supposed to be back today?

01:52.253 --> 01:54.123
He's adjusting to having his mom around,

01:54.128 --> 01:55.703
but, yeah, he should be here by now.

01:55.708 --> 01:56.704
Let's do this.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.062
Palm Springs, California.

01:59.067 --> 02:02.810
Playground to Hollywood,
currently a horror scene.

02:02.815 --> 02:07.039
Enter one male torso, unidentifiable.

02:07.110 --> 02:09.018
If it wasn't for a woman
who had some car trouble,

02:09.023 --> 02:10.854
no one would have ever
even found the body.

02:10.859 --> 02:13.278
And the coroner on site
said the dismemberment

02:13.283 --> 02:14.657
probably happened postmortem.

02:14.720 --> 02:17.494
Now, the 2004 torso murders here in D.C.

02:17.499 --> 02:18.983
are still unsolved.

02:18.988 --> 02:20.919
We profiled the unsub in that case,

02:20.944 --> 02:23.754
removed body parts as a
forensic countermeasure

02:23.755 --> 02:24.925
to prevent IDing the victims.

02:24.987 --> 02:28.193
We figured me must have gotten
locked up on another case.

02:28.198 --> 02:29.928
Now he may be back and taunting us.

02:29.933 --> 02:32.175
Any potential victims on the
local missing persons lists?

02:32.180 --> 02:33.898
So far there's been no reports

02:33.949 --> 02:35.912
of a missing male
there in the last month.

02:35.949 --> 02:40.043
So, no missing persons and a
chopped up body we can't identify.

02:40.110 --> 02:41.473
Is Robert Durst in town?

02:41.511 --> 02:43.644
Nope, he's serving 7
years on a weapons charge.

02:43.691 --> 02:45.457
Sorry I'm late, guys. Traffic was bad.

02:45.519 --> 02:46.756
Any I.D. on the torso victim?

02:46.781 --> 02:48.291
Uh, they don't have enough of him

02:48.296 --> 02:51.079
to do a query with the national

02:51.165 --> 02:53.196
missing and unidentified
persons database.

02:53.258 --> 02:56.588
He made a real effort to
pull of permanent concealment.

02:56.633 --> 02:59.811
Well, that could indicate a known
link between the unsub and the victim.

02:59.836 --> 03:02.953
Or he hoped to hide the fact that
a killer had just arrived in town.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.500
It strikes me that he must
be familiar with the area.

03:06.575 --> 03:08.633
I mean, you don't murder
someone out in the desert

03:08.715 --> 03:10.961
and then bring the body
back into a populated area.

03:11.023 --> 03:13.203
So the unsub was skilled
enough to hunt, kill,

03:13.266 --> 03:15.096
dismember, and dispose of his victims,

03:15.133 --> 03:16.086
all within city limits.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.906
And escape without being seen.

03:18.047 --> 03:19.828
And his tradecraft was on point, too.

03:19.901 --> 03:21.445
He brought an effective cutting tool

03:21.472 --> 03:24.425
and had a secure location
or vehicle to do the deed.

03:24.539 --> 03:26.320
That kind of planning could indicate

03:26.383 --> 03:28.891
he's been fantasizing about
something like this for quite a while.

03:28.915 --> 03:30.844
And if the reality didn't
live up to the fantasy,

03:30.917 --> 03:32.664
he'll keep at it until he gets it right.

03:32.750 --> 03:34.608
Wheels up in 30.

03:39.915 --> 03:43.226
Reid? Hey, are you good?

03:43.285 --> 03:46.375
Yeah. I'm good. I'm a little frazzled.

03:46.492 --> 03:49.085
How's your mom?

03:49.156 --> 03:51.445
You've got your hands full, I'm sure.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.969
I finally found an in-home nurse
that knows what she's doing.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.086
It's just we've had a little trouble
coordinating our schedules.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.455
Do you think you should be there
to help ease the transition?

03:59.479 --> 04:03.687
No, I think it's important that my
mom learns to rely on Nurse Campbell.

04:03.772 --> 04:06.615
She's your mother. If you
need more time, take it.

04:06.687 --> 04:09.031
Oh, all that I need
is a comprehensive plan

04:09.077 --> 04:10.685
to help me balance
being at home with her

04:10.750 --> 04:11.908
and doing my work here.

04:11.969 --> 04:13.569
Then you should take
the time to do that.

04:13.664 --> 04:16.430
That's just the thing. By distracting
my conscious mind with work,

04:16.485 --> 04:17.970
it will allow my subconscious
mind to form a plan

04:17.994 --> 04:20.516
at roughly 10 billion times the speed.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.693
Hi, it's Lisa. You know what to do.

04:26.584 --> 04:27.763
Hey, it's me.

04:27.829 --> 04:31.964
I know you don't want
to talk, uh, to me...

04:35.070 --> 04:40.840
But... I... I miss you.

05:29.127 --> 05:31.985
“A good husband makes a good wife.”

05:32.080 --> 05:34.969
John Florio.

05:36.255 --> 05:39.144
The victim in the dumpster
was Paul Mastriano,

05:39.191 --> 05:40.812
28-year-old real estate agent.

05:40.859 --> 05:42.781
When he didn't come
and pick his daughter up

05:42.828 --> 05:44.516
and take her to school
yesterday morning,

05:44.563 --> 05:47.120
his ex-wife immediately contacted
the Palm Springs police department.

05:47.144 --> 05:48.060
I'm sending you the deets now.

05:48.107 --> 05:49.880
We can rule out the D.C. torso case.

05:49.927 --> 05:51.146
He only killed prostitutes.

05:51.193 --> 05:53.312
How did the ex-wife I.D. this victim?

05:53.359 --> 05:56.960
She had his DNA profile when they
did a genealogy study together

05:57.038 --> 05:58.473
before they broke up last August.

05:58.567 --> 06:01.153
So they were married 7 years,
had a 6-year-old daughter.

06:01.207 --> 06:02.607
Did the wife say why they divorced?

06:02.635 --> 06:04.970
No, but let me look at records.

06:05.017 --> 06:08.515
Well, he had a domestic abuse
complaint and two DUls last year.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.796
Could the wife have had
something to do with the murder?

06:10.851 --> 06:12.936
Didn't your buddy
Judd Ray barely survive

06:12.976 --> 06:14.041
a hit his wife put on him?

06:14.088 --> 06:15.876
Yeah, she hired a hit man.

06:15.923 --> 06:18.358
But this, I mean, I've had cases

06:18.405 --> 06:20.013
where husbands dismembered their wives,

06:20.060 --> 06:22.049
but rarely is it the other way around.

06:22.096 --> 06:23.750
And she came in to I.D. him.

06:23.797 --> 06:26.237
In those cases, the guilty spouse

06:26.339 --> 06:29.257
didn't want law enforcement to
know that their other half was dead.

06:29.304 --> 06:31.226
He was last seen at a strip club

06:31.265 --> 06:33.335
about a mile away
from where his body was found.

06:33.390 --> 06:36.022
Well, a lot of creeps and criminals
run a place like that.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.172
We'll have to check that out.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.670
This story is blowing up on the news,

06:38.694 --> 06:40.819
this guy gotta know we found the body.

06:40.952 --> 06:42.179
It could cause him to accelerate.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.249
Penelope, any similar cases in the area?

06:44.327 --> 06:49.343
Well, I can check ViCAP
and neighboring states.

06:49.561 --> 06:53.202
Jeepers. Another body,
and by body I mean torso,

06:53.257 --> 06:54.936
was just found 10 blocks
from the original one.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.108
Was it found in a dumpster?

06:56.179 --> 06:58.090
Uh, no, pedestrian spotted
it in a parking lot.

06:58.137 --> 06:59.441
It could be an acceleration,

06:59.488 --> 07:01.314
or the unsub was interrupted.

07:01.424 --> 07:03.525
We are 20 minutes out.
Notify Chief Bailor

07:03.580 --> 07:05.393
to leave the body and
crime scene undisturbed

07:05.464 --> 07:06.244
until we get there.

07:06.291 --> 07:07.103
Consider it done.

07:07.128 --> 07:08.529
JJ, why don't you, Tara, and Luke

07:08.576 --> 07:09.704
go to the newest disposal site.

07:09.728 --> 07:11.154
Dave, Stephen, find out what you can

07:11.178 --> 07:12.650
about the first victim from the club.

07:12.674 --> 07:14.760
Spencer and I will go
to the Palm Springs P.D.

07:14.785 --> 07:17.861
and talk to the chief.
He's got his hands full.

07:21.839 --> 07:23.606
Yes, sir.

07:24.575 --> 07:27.256
We're very sorry about
the officers you lost.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.423
Worst thing in the department's history.

07:29.470 --> 07:31.921
But right now we have
to focus on this case.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.496
I've got conference room set up for you

07:33.520 --> 07:35.085
right over here with
everything you've got so far.

07:35.109 --> 07:37.865
Any I.D. on the second victim yet?

07:37.912 --> 07:39.112
No.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.861
But I've got 50,000 residents

07:40.955 --> 07:42.822
worried we have a serial
killer on our hands.

07:42.885 --> 07:45.898
Is that the first victim's
ex-wife and daughter?

07:47.346 --> 07:49.372
Madison was supposed to
see her dad yesterday.

07:49.419 --> 07:51.641
Do you mind if we talk to them?

07:51.688 --> 07:53.500
Thank you.

07:56.239 --> 07:57.560
Hi.

07:57.585 --> 08:00.580
Oh. If you're from social services,

08:00.653 --> 08:02.207
I haven't told her yet.

08:02.411 --> 08:04.587
Are you gonna take me to my daddy now?

08:04.634 --> 08:07.102
No, not yet, sweetheart.

08:07.549 --> 08:09.825
Actually, we are from the FBI.

08:10.140 --> 08:11.641
What's FBI?

08:11.666 --> 08:14.111
Whoa! That is a cool doll.

08:14.188 --> 08:15.721
What's her name?

08:16.408 --> 08:17.646
Sally.

08:17.693 --> 08:19.960
She has the same hair as you.

08:21.430 --> 08:24.019
Do you mind if my colleague Dr. Reid

08:24.066 --> 08:25.274
takes Madison to get a snack

08:25.321 --> 08:26.976
and we can chat for a few minutes?

08:27.023 --> 08:30.025
Maddie, you be a good girl
and you get something nice

08:30.072 --> 08:31.614
and you come right back, ok?

08:31.661 --> 08:32.548
Yes, Mommy.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.729
Ok.

08:33.775 --> 08:35.359
After you.

08:35.467 --> 08:36.842
What's FBI?

08:36.868 --> 08:40.164
FBI? You know, we're
kind of like the police.

08:40.210 --> 08:41.187
Let me ask you this...
Have you ever had

08:41.212 --> 08:43.054
a peanut butter and jellyfish sandwich?

08:43.206 --> 08:44.421
Eew!

08:45.655 --> 08:47.625
That's what he looked like.

08:47.742 --> 08:49.820
Paul and I were happy then.

08:49.921 --> 08:52.234
I'm so sorry for your
loss, Mrs. Mastriano.

08:52.320 --> 08:54.070
Thank you.

08:54.179 --> 08:56.685
I mean, I always thought
Paul's drinking would kill him,

08:56.732 --> 08:58.407
but I didn't think
it would be like this.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.177
Did he typically go drinking
with anyone in particular?

09:01.224 --> 09:03.859
No. He always drank alone.

09:03.906 --> 09:05.771
I mean, that's how bad it was.

09:09.385 --> 09:12.953
How am I gonna tell Maddie?

09:20.056 --> 09:21.777
Thanks for meeting me outside.

09:21.824 --> 09:23.669
I don't want the girls
seeing me with cops.

09:23.771 --> 09:25.101
It makes them nervous.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.803
No problem. We appreciate
you talking with us.

09:27.850 --> 09:30.740
When you called, you said Paul Mastriano

09:30.787 --> 09:33.909
came in the night before last.

09:33.956 --> 09:35.435
Is that him?

09:35.521 --> 09:39.395
Yeah. Came in all the
time after the divorce.

09:39.442 --> 09:42.564
Tell you the truth, he came in a
bunch of times before that, too.

09:42.611 --> 09:44.987
How much did he drink the
other night while he was here?

09:45.034 --> 09:46.969
5, 6 drinks.

09:47.016 --> 09:48.203
Paid his tab and left.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.393
Did he piss anyone
off while he was here,

09:50.440 --> 09:52.628
maybe get frisky with
one of the dancers?

09:52.675 --> 09:54.843
No way. He wasn't that kind of customer.

09:54.890 --> 09:56.832
He was a quiet guy,
just drinking by himself.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.200
What time did he leave?

09:58.247 --> 10:01.116
Candi was still on stage,

10:01.163 --> 10:02.459
so... around midnight.

10:02.522 --> 10:05.438
Anyone leave right
before or after he left?

10:05.493 --> 10:06.889
We're open 24/7.

10:06.936 --> 10:08.978
I got guys coming and
going day and night.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.893
Any security cameras inside?

10:10.940 --> 10:12.548
They make our customers nervous.

10:12.595 --> 10:13.896
Besides,

10:13.943 --> 10:16.398
we got 24-hour live security.

10:16.445 --> 10:18.754
Well, thank you for your time, Dwayne.

10:18.801 --> 10:20.647
You've been a big help.

10:23.085 --> 10:26.262
The unsub couldn't have known
Mastriano would leave early.

10:26.309 --> 10:28.344
Makes him a victim of opportunity.

10:28.391 --> 10:30.900
Unless the unsub did
something to make him leave.

10:30.947 --> 10:33.882
This is the second body
that the unsub has transported

10:33.929 --> 10:35.317
to a secondary disposal site.

10:35.364 --> 10:37.673
If he left it out in the
open like this on purpose,

10:37.720 --> 10:39.408
he may be making a statement.

10:39.455 --> 10:41.544
Yeah. Yeah.

10:41.591 --> 10:42.524
Oh...

10:42.571 --> 10:44.580
Judging by the lacerations,

10:44.627 --> 10:49.531
the unsub was really
pissed off at this victim.

10:49.578 --> 10:52.443
So much so, he missed something.

10:52.490 --> 10:55.917
Uh, hey, do you have an ICM scanner?

10:57.119 --> 10:58.785
Right here.

11:03.092 --> 11:05.201
The second victim is Brent Miller,

11:05.248 --> 11:07.179
date of birth, May 15, 1982.

11:07.281 --> 11:09.456
I asked Garcia to find
out what she can about him.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.891
How'd they make the I.D.?

11:10.938 --> 11:12.739
Oh, he did an ICM.

11:12.786 --> 11:14.908
Internal Cardiac Monitor
with a transmitter

11:14.955 --> 11:16.319
linked to the patient's medical file.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.111
Our agents are headed
over to the coroner's

11:18.158 --> 11:20.223
to see if he's determined
an official cause of death.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.291
Garcia, I'm putting you on speakerphone.

11:22.354 --> 11:23.885
Ok, there's no connection
between the victims,

11:23.909 --> 11:25.787
and there doesn't seem to
be anything on Brent Miller.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.198
He managed Downtown Bagels.

11:27.245 --> 11:28.580
He has no criminal record.

11:28.627 --> 11:29.935
He has no DMV infractions.

11:29.982 --> 11:32.383
Any family in the area?

11:32.430 --> 11:34.319
Mm, never married, no kids.

11:34.366 --> 11:37.088
Uh, he did just go
through a recent breakup,

11:37.135 --> 11:39.724
so his credit card receipts
have quite the bar tabs.

11:39.771 --> 11:41.271
The first victim, Paul Mastriano,

11:41.318 --> 11:43.094
went through a divorce a few months ago.

11:43.141 --> 11:45.550
Garcia, do you have any
information on Brent's relationship?

11:45.597 --> 11:47.467
Uh, according to social media...

11:47.623 --> 11:50.396
Ouch. His girlfriend of 3 years

11:50.443 --> 11:52.570
just moved to Alaska with
her new beau last month.

11:52.617 --> 11:54.025
You think that's significant?

11:54.072 --> 11:56.174
Both of our victims
had relationship issues

11:56.221 --> 11:57.901
and were apparently
drowning their sorrows.

11:57.943 --> 11:59.464
It's the best lead we have right now.

11:59.511 --> 12:02.315
It'd be a good idea to
canvass all the bars in town.

12:06.498 --> 12:09.187
You can't just cut me off.

12:09.413 --> 12:11.535
I didn't come back to argue.

12:11.777 --> 12:13.979
I thought I'd be gone
before you got home.

12:14.035 --> 12:16.569
You made a commitment to me.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.608
I've made up my mind.

12:25.317 --> 12:27.550
You're just gonna...

12:27.597 --> 12:29.107
throw us away?

12:29.154 --> 12:32.589
We waited 3 years just
to be able to get married.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.399
If there's another guy, just tell me.

12:34.446 --> 12:35.633
You owe me that.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.226
You're paranoid.

12:39.965 --> 12:41.902
It's Kate and Diane, isn't it?

12:41.988 --> 12:44.902
They're the only friends I have left.

12:45.012 --> 12:46.340
They care about me.

12:46.472 --> 12:48.613
They don't make me feel useless.

12:49.457 --> 12:51.774
You have to stop doing that.

12:53.394 --> 12:55.867
I'll try.

12:56.058 --> 12:58.547
Really. I'll get help.

13:03.722 --> 13:06.519
The police still have no suspects

13:06.582 --> 13:08.572
as the mutilated body count and fear

13:08.597 --> 13:09.893
rise in the community.

13:09.918 --> 13:11.253
Authorities would not go into detail,

13:11.277 --> 13:14.571
however, they did confirm that
this is the second mutilated corpse

13:14.596 --> 13:16.102
Discovered in the street...

13:23.847 --> 13:25.268
You ok?

13:25.375 --> 13:27.218
Not really.

13:27.265 --> 13:28.333
Hi.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.028
Babe.

13:30.403 --> 13:32.091
I love you.

13:32.204 --> 13:33.638
I'd do anything for you.

13:33.685 --> 13:35.948
What we're going through,
it's just married couple stuff.

13:35.995 --> 13:37.854
Don't let him play his tricks on you.

13:38.026 --> 13:40.784
You asked us to come to
prevent this from happening.

13:40.910 --> 13:42.668
Don't let them manipulate you.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.003
This is who we are.

13:58.018 --> 14:01.162
I can estimate that both
men were in their early 30s,

14:01.232 --> 14:02.771
and based on their torsos,

14:02.811 --> 14:04.521
they were about average
height and build.

14:04.615 --> 14:06.266
Similarities can mean
they're surrogates.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.795
Cause of death on the first victim
is undetermined

14:08.842 --> 14:11.509
because the appendage removal
was postmortem.

14:11.556 --> 14:14.307
But on the second victim,
it was antemortem.

14:14.332 --> 14:16.268
So his C.O.D. is exsanguination.

14:16.293 --> 14:18.863
Poor guy was alive
when he got chopped up.

14:18.965 --> 14:21.717
It goes beyond forensic
countermeasures. It's sadistic.

14:21.826 --> 14:24.002
And hard enough to do on a dead body.

14:24.057 --> 14:25.881
I mean, this guy's escalating.

14:25.975 --> 14:27.428
He's getting off on this.

14:27.553 --> 14:29.121
Yeah. Tell me about the hack job

14:29.207 --> 14:31.045
on the second victim's chest.

14:31.123 --> 14:34.014
The penetrating wounds to the
thoracic region were antemortem, too,

14:34.115 --> 14:35.966
yet there's no evidence
that the victim struggled

14:35.990 --> 14:36.803
during the attack.

14:36.828 --> 14:39.240
Then how did he control his victim

14:39.265 --> 14:40.428
while he was chopping him up?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.045
Toxicology on both victims

14:42.115 --> 14:44.725
showed a central nervous system
depressant and paralytic.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.240
Ok, so induced paralysis
followed by torture.

14:47.303 --> 14:49.256
That sounds like a date rape cocktail.

14:49.334 --> 14:51.137
Alcohol dosed with chloral hydrate?

14:51.162 --> 14:52.995
Someone slipped him a roofie.

14:54.529 --> 14:56.225
Looks good, Mark.

14:56.912 --> 14:58.443
Can I buy you another?

14:58.802 --> 15:00.665
I've already had way too many.

15:01.451 --> 15:02.791
But I'd take a beer.

15:02.826 --> 15:04.134
Great.

15:04.264 --> 15:06.317
Two Rocky Mountain, tall boys.

15:06.597 --> 15:07.631
What's up?

15:07.826 --> 15:09.857
Are you trying to get me drunk?

15:10.006 --> 15:13.014
Just helping you forget your troubles.

15:13.740 --> 15:15.506
Did Bill tell everybody?

15:16.506 --> 15:18.107
I'm in the same boat.

15:18.214 --> 15:20.186
Jarred just dumped me.

15:22.013 --> 15:24.012
To moving on.

15:25.539 --> 15:26.804
To moving on.

15:37.764 --> 15:39.597
Way too loud in here.

15:40.401 --> 15:41.967
Let's take a walk.

15:42.725 --> 15:45.514
Come on. Let's get out of here.

16:08.795 --> 16:11.397
Well, this is more public
than the prior victims.

16:11.444 --> 16:13.662
And this location concerns me.

16:13.741 --> 16:16.952
We have a significant and very
visible gay community here.

16:17.077 --> 16:18.444
This is right smack in the middle.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.662
It's probably just
coincidence, you know?

16:20.764 --> 16:22.303
If these are anti-gay hate crimes,

16:22.373 --> 16:24.021
then why were the first
two victims straight?

16:24.045 --> 16:25.780
With the way the unsub
had been escalating,

16:25.842 --> 16:29.787
I was expecting more
rage and overkill, but...

16:30.772 --> 16:32.162
This is...

16:32.350 --> 16:34.487
It's actually more controlled.

16:34.811 --> 16:37.100
Yeah. That and the location

16:37.264 --> 16:40.147
seems like it's staged
for maximum shock value.

16:40.172 --> 16:41.647
To horrify people in general

16:41.709 --> 16:42.951
or for someone in the gay community?

16:42.975 --> 16:44.730
It could be that the target is gay,

16:44.777 --> 16:45.965
or the unsub,

16:46.012 --> 16:47.825
or both.

16:53.147 --> 16:55.354
Mark, it's me.

16:56.022 --> 16:58.744
I know you're angry.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.160
Mark?

17:01.936 --> 17:03.803
Are you in there?

17:06.452 --> 17:07.465
Mark.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.413
Are you in there?!

17:10.787 --> 17:12.371
Mark?

17:12.834 --> 17:15.248
Are you home?

17:20.013 --> 17:22.998
Are you ok?

17:23.905 --> 17:25.881
Mark?

17:26.483 --> 17:28.287
Oh, thank God.

17:28.501 --> 17:31.177
There's been another murder.
I was... I was getting worried.

17:31.616 --> 17:33.259
Sorry. I...

17:33.639 --> 17:36.952
No, no, it's ok. I just, uh...

17:37.702 --> 17:39.889
I'm surprised.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.748
I'm happy you came back home.

17:42.850 --> 17:44.405
I'm not back.

17:44.561 --> 17:45.838
I just...

17:46.720 --> 17:49.077
I needed to know you were safe.

17:52.191 --> 17:53.991
You're hurt.

17:54.256 --> 17:56.615
Oh, it's nothing.
I just caught it on the latch

17:56.802 --> 17:58.287
when I was loading my van.

17:58.420 --> 18:00.186
Do they know who was killed?

18:00.537 --> 18:02.588
It didn't say, but...

18:03.248 --> 18:05.457
His body was found
just 6 blocks from here.

18:06.217 --> 18:08.080
I know this is difficult, Ms. Ericsson,

18:08.127 --> 18:10.449
but we may have found your brother.

18:10.889 --> 18:15.912
You said Dale had a unique
Y-shaped abdominal scar?

18:25.350 --> 18:27.233
We're very sorry for your loss.

18:27.444 --> 18:31.468
I can't stop imagining
what Dale went through.

18:36.602 --> 18:40.694
What they did to my brother is inhuman.

18:41.006 --> 18:43.084
And we are doing everything we can

18:43.162 --> 18:45.092
to make sure whoever is responsible

18:45.194 --> 18:46.658
is brought to justice.

18:48.108 --> 18:50.122
This unsub seems to be targeting men

18:50.169 --> 18:53.194
who were having relationship troubles.

18:53.303 --> 18:56.616
Do you know if Dale was going
through a breakup or anything?

18:56.809 --> 18:59.632
Yes, but he said it was just a fling.

19:00.061 --> 19:02.748
He's really careful,
though, about dating.

19:03.444 --> 19:05.497
He'd never just go off with some guy

19:05.522 --> 19:08.809
he didn't know and trust
from the local gay community.

19:09.694 --> 19:12.955
Did his sexuality cause
any issues between you two?

19:13.092 --> 19:15.614
No. I encouraged him to be himself

19:15.661 --> 19:18.740
and live his life.

19:21.108 --> 19:23.477
And now he's dead because of it.

19:24.139 --> 19:28.569
Your brother was not
killed because he was gay.

19:29.795 --> 19:32.356
Then why was he killed?

19:35.303 --> 19:37.751
We're looking
for a local male in his 30s

19:37.798 --> 19:41.319
with control issues.
He may be gay or bisexual,

19:41.373 --> 19:43.319
and he has been
harboring a kill fantasy.

19:43.381 --> 19:46.927
Serial killers exist along a
continuum just like anyone else.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.497
This one happens to be gay.

19:48.616 --> 19:51.372
Until now, he's been able to
sublimate his homicidal urges

19:51.397 --> 19:53.803
by controlling either his work
environment or his relationships.

19:53.827 --> 19:56.108
He may not be physically
imposing himself,

19:56.139 --> 19:59.280
so he drugs his victims to
paralyze and control them.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.927
He then chops of their
limbs as a method of torture

20:01.952 --> 20:03.709
before he removes their heads

20:03.741 --> 20:06.170
because this gives him the
ultimate feeling of power.

20:06.209 --> 20:08.030
It's also an act of depersonalization,

20:08.092 --> 20:10.584
meaning he's intentionally
negating the characteristics

20:10.631 --> 20:11.787
that make them uniquely human.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.717
We haven't found any of
the body parts in dumpsters.

20:13.741 --> 20:16.006
Do you still think that's
his disposal method?

20:16.123 --> 20:18.764
It's either that or he digs
shallow graves in the desert.

20:18.858 --> 20:20.944
It's easier to dig 5 one-foot holes

20:21.022 --> 20:22.577
than it is to dig one 5-foot hole.

20:22.702 --> 20:26.053
The torsos he displayed
are his trophies.

20:26.202 --> 20:27.537
He wanted them to be found.

20:27.616 --> 20:29.248
He targets victims of opportunity,

20:29.295 --> 20:32.092
but they've all been
blond, healthy, and slim.

20:32.170 --> 20:33.623
So he has a type.

20:33.717 --> 20:36.178
Which means his victims
are most likely surrogates

20:36.225 --> 20:38.170
for a current or ex-partner,

20:38.248 --> 20:40.295
even a spouse, who he controlled

20:40.389 --> 20:41.670
through non-violent manipulation.

20:41.694 --> 20:44.037
We believe he may have
been rejected recently,

20:44.077 --> 20:46.041
causing the unsub to escalate to murder

20:46.066 --> 20:47.754
in order to regain a sense of control.

20:47.808 --> 20:49.369
You should increase your nightly patrols

20:49.393 --> 20:51.597
of alleys and lots near bars and clubs.

20:51.690 --> 20:54.440
We will keep the community
apprised of any new developments.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.448
Thank you all.

20:59.722 --> 21:02.581
Oh, my God. It's Dale!

21:02.770 --> 21:04.849
Dale?

21:08.597 --> 21:10.276
Stay with me tonight.

21:10.768 --> 21:12.499
I don't need this pressure right now.

21:12.714 --> 21:15.435
We need each other,
especially right now.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.317
I need my friends, too.

21:17.364 --> 21:19.768
But I'm the one that holds you at night.

21:19.886 --> 21:21.862
Protects you.

21:22.929 --> 21:25.529
Please. Stay?

21:28.439 --> 21:30.350
I'll make you some chamomile.

21:30.517 --> 21:32.556
It relaxes you.

21:44.665 --> 21:46.033
Where are you going?

21:46.447 --> 21:48.225
I just need a second.

21:51.501 --> 21:54.407
God, can't I use the bathroom
without you hovering over me?

21:54.454 --> 21:57.690
You're right.
That's not the way I meant it.

21:57.845 --> 21:59.067
How did you mean it?

21:59.259 --> 22:02.006
I just wanted to make
sure you're all right.

22:09.399 --> 22:12.532
You're sweet, but I still need a minute.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.679
I need to tell you...

22:19.844 --> 22:21.848
I...

22:22.172 --> 22:26.266
I thought my life was
over when you left.

22:26.602 --> 22:29.883
I'm sorry I pushed you away, baby.

22:38.501 --> 22:40.946
Why don't you use the master bath.

22:48.621 --> 22:51.954
All of the media attention
should be working in our favor.

22:52.055 --> 22:53.790
Well, he knows we're
here and we're after him.

22:53.814 --> 22:55.135
It'll cause him to make mistakes.

22:55.182 --> 22:56.770
He'll get cocky, push the envelope,

22:56.840 --> 22:58.335
try to prove he's superior.

22:58.429 --> 23:00.231
And he'll take it out
on his next victim.

23:00.278 --> 23:01.487
We can't let that happen.

23:01.534 --> 23:03.451
No, we don't have to.
This kind of narcissism

23:03.476 --> 23:05.381
would play out in his
personal relationships as well.

23:05.405 --> 23:07.270
He could be married. I mean,
like with any relationship,

23:07.294 --> 23:09.126
he started out charming
and eventually...

23:09.173 --> 23:10.814
Gay marriage leads to gay divorce.

23:10.876 --> 23:12.799
There'd be a record of that.

23:12.846 --> 23:14.384
Give me what you got, wonder woman.

23:14.432 --> 23:16.876
Garcia, search Palm Springs
and the surrounding areas

23:16.923 --> 23:19.359
for male same sex couples
that filed for divorce

23:19.406 --> 23:20.894
within the last few months.

23:20.941 --> 23:24.043
Marital bliss, followed by marital diss.

23:24.090 --> 23:26.466
Of course. Why didn't
I think of that? Ok.

23:26.513 --> 23:30.853
There were 3 recent gay
divorces in Palm Springs,

23:30.923 --> 23:32.252
but they all moved
out of town after that.

23:32.276 --> 23:34.486
You know, actually, that small
number isn't all that shocking,

23:34.510 --> 23:36.235
taking into account the brief time frame

23:36.260 --> 23:37.700
and the fact that gay couples divorce

23:37.724 --> 23:39.157
at about half the rate
straight couples do.

23:39.181 --> 23:40.642
Maybe they aren't divorced yet.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.316
If they just separated, it
would still enrage the unsub,

23:43.363 --> 23:45.847
and it could have led to this.

24:40.967 --> 24:42.985
I told you that when you got engaged.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.221
You don't know who a man is
until you have your first big fight.

24:45.245 --> 24:48.654
I know. But every time I
think I'm finally over him,

24:48.814 --> 24:50.149
he does something sweet,

24:50.196 --> 24:51.973
and I'm right back in his arms.

24:52.020 --> 24:54.261
So he has some redeeming qualities?

24:55.329 --> 24:58.838
No one's 100% good or evil.

24:59.048 --> 25:01.618
Except maybe the psycho who killed Dale.

25:02.118 --> 25:04.915
I still can't believe he's gone.

25:08.712 --> 25:10.329
I should go.

25:10.431 --> 25:13.273
It was good to finally
spend time with you again.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.204
Sure you're gonna be ok?

25:15.282 --> 25:17.774
Just called an Uber.
She'll be here in two minutes.

25:17.899 --> 25:18.907
Be safe.

25:18.946 --> 25:21.072
You too.

25:29.759 --> 25:31.491
Hey, Wes.

25:32.103 --> 25:33.360
Mark.

25:33.548 --> 25:35.341
Have you seen Bill?

25:35.931 --> 25:37.603
I don't want to talk to you.

25:37.884 --> 25:40.712
I know I've been a terrible friend.

25:40.985 --> 25:43.182
Cutting Bill off from you was wrong.

25:43.501 --> 25:45.220
I'm trying to do better.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.520
Try somewhere else.

25:48.056 --> 25:49.275
Give me a chance.

25:49.462 --> 25:50.814
Please?

25:51.126 --> 25:53.971
Let me buy you a drink. Hear me out.

25:56.978 --> 25:59.446
I really messed up with Bill.

25:59.939 --> 26:01.745
I know that now.

26:06.634 --> 26:09.442
He just needs to...

26:09.759 --> 26:13.779
Uh, feel like he's his own man.

26:14.540 --> 26:16.682
Oh, I should have eaten something.

26:16.729 --> 26:19.087
This is going straight to my head.

26:19.251 --> 26:21.837
Bartender must have
mixed them pretty strong.

26:22.064 --> 26:25.892
Oh, whoa, I'm kind of dizzy.

26:26.204 --> 26:29.215
Maybe you're coming down with something.

26:30.087 --> 26:31.579
I'll get you home.

26:31.845 --> 26:34.946
My van's right around the corner.

26:44.181 --> 26:47.124
You brought this on yourself.

27:14.275 --> 27:17.056
We don't even know who was killed.

27:17.280 --> 27:19.381
It's terrible.

27:19.826 --> 27:21.948
Can't get much more public than this.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.929
Can't get any angrier than this either.

27:23.977 --> 27:27.352
No question this is meant to shock
and terrorize the gay community.

27:27.470 --> 27:29.755
But he keeps coming
back to the same area

27:29.802 --> 27:31.412
despite increased patrols here.

27:31.459 --> 27:34.821
To justify that risk, he must have
a very personal target in mind.

27:34.931 --> 27:38.227
Someone who's connected to this
neighborhood and this victim,

27:38.282 --> 27:40.931
and that's why he deviated from
his preferred physical type.

27:41.009 --> 27:43.657
These murders, they made me realize

27:43.727 --> 27:46.009
how awful I was to you.

27:50.465 --> 27:51.752
I want you back.

27:51.788 --> 27:54.788
It'll take more than
a half-assed apology.

27:54.881 --> 27:58.072
You're right, babe. What is it you need?

27:58.163 --> 28:00.296
I need to know it's
going to be different.

28:00.417 --> 28:03.152
It will. I promise.

28:03.381 --> 28:06.077
Let's go someplace where
we can talk about it.

28:14.381 --> 28:15.489
Dog tags.

28:15.536 --> 28:18.179
So he's not even trying
to hide his victims' identities anymore.

28:18.226 --> 28:20.915
He wants the target
to know who he killed.

28:20.962 --> 28:23.297
Yeah. Wesley Parham.

28:23.344 --> 28:24.647
I'm sending this to Garcia.

28:24.709 --> 28:27.722
Penelope, we need an
address and next of kin on...

28:27.769 --> 28:29.757
Hey, guess what. I'm already doing

28:29.804 --> 28:31.559
a military archival search,

28:31.606 --> 28:33.161
so you are welcome.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.889
Sergeant Wesley Parham,

28:35.958 --> 28:37.623
honorably discharged two years ago,

28:37.717 --> 28:38.979
45 Palm Canyon Drive.

28:39.026 --> 28:40.256
What else do you have on him?

28:40.313 --> 28:43.529
31 years old. Did 3
tours in Afghanistan.

28:43.618 --> 28:46.253
Super secret security clearance.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.833
And he was an army Intelligence officer.

28:47.857 --> 28:49.428
I'm sending pic and bio now.

28:49.514 --> 28:51.245
Moved here 18 months ago.

28:51.292 --> 28:52.732
No relatives in the area.

28:52.811 --> 28:56.130
No, but his partner, Nick Goode,

28:56.177 --> 28:57.889
works out of town,

28:57.920 --> 28:59.514
comes home on the weekends.

28:59.662 --> 29:01.732
He will be landing at Palm Springs

29:01.818 --> 29:03.201
International Airport in 30 minutes.

29:03.225 --> 29:05.709
Dave, you and Stephen bring
him in for an interview.

29:05.779 --> 29:08.162
In the meantime, we need
to build Wesley's timeline

29:08.187 --> 29:10.343
through the community. JJ, pull
together a press conference.

29:10.367 --> 29:11.655
We'll set it up near the memorial.

29:11.679 --> 29:12.446
Sure.

29:12.493 --> 29:14.717
Spencer and Tara
should keep photographing the crowd.

29:14.795 --> 29:17.305
This is exactly what
he was looking for...

29:17.352 --> 29:19.086
Attention and fear.

29:19.389 --> 29:22.801
Unless he's already started
stalking his next victim.

29:24.967 --> 29:27.048
Last night was, um...

29:27.095 --> 29:28.516
Great.

29:28.826 --> 29:30.287
Amazing.

29:30.478 --> 29:32.566
Yes. But...

29:33.232 --> 29:34.835
I couldn't stay.

29:35.147 --> 29:36.348
I needed some space.

29:36.373 --> 29:37.938
Space.

29:38.803 --> 29:41.208
To be honest, I feel
like I can't breathe

29:41.255 --> 29:42.588
in this relationship.

29:42.635 --> 29:44.211
And remember my last job?

29:44.258 --> 29:47.287
You called me 20 times a
day there, so they fired me.

29:47.373 --> 29:49.654
I called you out of love.

29:49.756 --> 29:50.936
That's not love.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.153
It's not?

29:52.607 --> 29:54.412
Look what's happening around us.

29:54.506 --> 29:56.826
It's dangerous.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.553
It's how things should be.

30:00.740 --> 30:02.311
You get married.

30:02.404 --> 30:05.341
You stay together for life.

30:05.686 --> 30:07.936
If I come back,

30:08.631 --> 30:10.804
it has to be on my terms.

30:11.154 --> 30:12.306
Of course, babe.

30:12.779 --> 30:15.154
You won't push away my friends?

30:15.321 --> 30:17.498
Whatever makes you happy.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.304
Nurse Campbell, hi, it's Spencer.

30:23.351 --> 30:24.485
Hello, Dr. Reid.

30:24.532 --> 30:25.640
How is she feeling?

30:25.687 --> 30:26.787
She's resting now.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.976
The new meds have her pretty wiped out,

30:29.023 --> 30:31.445
but when she's up, her
confusion and paranoia

30:31.492 --> 30:32.560
are pretty intense.

30:32.607 --> 30:34.662
If you can just remind her where she is

30:34.709 --> 30:37.107
and reassure her that everything
will be ok, I'll be home soon.

30:37.131 --> 30:38.352
Can I ask you something?

30:38.399 --> 30:39.400
Yeah, of course.

30:39.447 --> 30:42.848
Are you sure having her here at home
is the best thing?

30:42.895 --> 30:46.513
She'd probably be better off in
a comprehensive care facility.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.763
I'm trying to give my mother
the best possible care,

30:48.788 --> 30:51.342
and it's just I feel
like she feels safer

30:51.420 --> 30:53.748
and happier with me at home.

30:53.826 --> 30:56.337
Maybe if you were here
all the time, she would,

30:56.384 --> 31:00.432
but when you're gone, she's suffering.

31:05.849 --> 31:08.002
Sadly, I can't talk about this
right now, I have to go, ok,

31:08.026 --> 31:11.162
but I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

31:18.398 --> 31:20.586
The body placement shows
calculated targeting.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.490
That's why we believe
the person responsible

31:22.545 --> 31:25.506
for these crimes may be
involved in coercive control

31:25.638 --> 31:27.101
or domestic abuse with his partner.

31:27.148 --> 31:30.162
Anyone in the viewing
audience who knew Wesley Parham

31:30.287 --> 31:32.779
or saw him in the last 48 hours,

31:32.951 --> 31:34.064
please call the number on your screen.

31:34.088 --> 31:35.522
Or if you are here today,

31:35.560 --> 31:38.309
please let one of my colleagues
know immediately. Thank you.

31:38.343 --> 31:40.107
We knew Wesley from the neighborhood.

31:40.303 --> 31:42.904
Last night he had dinner
at a table on the patio

31:42.929 --> 31:44.441
right near us at Rebecca's.

31:44.549 --> 31:45.474
Was he with anyone?

31:45.499 --> 31:47.599
Not then. But around midnight,

31:47.624 --> 31:49.248
when I was walking Scruffy,

31:49.393 --> 31:51.834
I saw him talking to a guy
over by the parking area.

31:51.943 --> 31:54.691
Could you describe that guy?

31:58.181 --> 32:00.948
It's ok. Take your time.

32:05.490 --> 32:09.646
We would do this dinner
date kind of thing

32:09.701 --> 32:13.373
where... he would sit at our
favorite table at Rebecca's

32:13.435 --> 32:17.776
and we would share a
meal over the phone.

32:18.092 --> 32:19.654
But we got cut short last night

32:19.679 --> 32:22.099
because he was comforting an old friend.

32:22.201 --> 32:23.502
Who was that?

32:23.549 --> 32:25.817
Bill Seavers.

32:25.864 --> 32:29.054
He's sort of a... sad case.

32:29.101 --> 32:31.224
He just got out of a toxic relationship,

32:31.313 --> 32:33.263
but he can't manage to
stay away from the guy.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.006
Do you know who his partner is?

32:35.063 --> 32:37.584
No, but he was really controlling.

32:38.068 --> 32:39.831
How about where they live?

32:39.878 --> 32:41.349
I've never been to their place,

32:41.396 --> 32:46.895
but... Wesley said that
Bill was on his own now.

32:47.037 --> 32:49.029
That he was renting a room.

32:50.584 --> 32:52.912
Excuse me.

32:54.553 --> 32:57.342
Penelope, I need you to
pull up everything you can

32:57.367 --> 32:59.279
on a Bill Seavers.

32:59.309 --> 33:00.787
See if you can match him to photos

33:00.812 --> 33:02.943
taken by Spencer and
Tara at the memorial.

33:03.029 --> 33:05.974
Ok, I'm running facial
recognition software

33:06.017 --> 33:07.560
with Bill's profile pic.

33:07.701 --> 33:09.490
And... Bingo is his name-o.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.185
Bill was there.

33:11.326 --> 33:13.670
He left with a guy, uh,

33:13.846 --> 33:16.451
6'2”-ish, dark hair, slim.

33:16.506 --> 33:18.287
Yeah, that matches the description

33:18.375 --> 33:20.909
Emily sent of the guy
Wesley was last seen with.

33:20.956 --> 33:22.042
Can you I.D. him?

33:22.067 --> 33:26.440
Give my software a hard second and...

33:26.562 --> 33:27.925
Mark Tolson.

33:28.097 --> 33:30.753
Sending you the addresses
of Bill's rented room

33:30.778 --> 33:31.801
and Bill and Mark's old condo.

33:31.825 --> 33:33.178
All right. We'll take Bill's place.

33:33.202 --> 33:34.423
Send Prentiss to the condo.

33:34.502 --> 33:35.736
Mm-hmm.

33:35.775 --> 33:38.651
But I want to invite friends over

33:38.831 --> 33:41.636
and be more independent.

33:41.917 --> 33:44.112
Ok. But...

33:44.810 --> 33:47.653
Love is all about
depending on each other.

33:47.870 --> 33:49.393
I understand that.

33:49.689 --> 33:51.386
But not to the point

33:51.432 --> 33:54.687
where you're calling
every number on my cell.

33:55.373 --> 33:58.975
It's obvious from last
night that you still love me.

33:59.667 --> 34:01.112
That's all we really need.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.393
I want to...

34:02.418 --> 34:03.852
Shh...

34:04.405 --> 34:06.034
It's settled.

34:07.690 --> 34:10.188
This isn't the time
to be out there alone,

34:10.235 --> 34:12.245
with all our friends being killed.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.197
I just talked to Wesley last night.

34:16.003 --> 34:19.215
Let's face it. If Wesley
hadn't been flirting

34:19.277 --> 34:22.036
with every guy at Rebecca's
he'd still be alive.

34:25.623 --> 34:29.406
How did you know that that's where
I met up with Wesley last night?

34:30.261 --> 34:33.753
It's your favorite place.
I just assumed.

34:34.495 --> 34:36.447
You were following me again.

34:36.617 --> 34:38.196
No.

34:38.822 --> 34:41.152
This is exactly the kind of thing

34:41.199 --> 34:42.722
that Kate and Diane warned me about.

34:42.806 --> 34:44.214
You're jealous of my friends.

34:44.239 --> 34:45.589
You're not going anywhere.

34:45.703 --> 34:47.565
Mark's parents broke up
when he was 6.

34:47.590 --> 34:49.011
According to family court records,

34:49.070 --> 34:51.222
his dad would take him
to the butcher shop,

34:51.311 --> 34:53.643
where Mark had to chop
carcasses while Dad drank.

34:53.728 --> 34:56.745
And Mom retained full custody, and Dad
didn't bother to see him after that.

34:56.792 --> 34:58.932
Well, that makes sense,
and Mark's behavior reeks

34:58.977 --> 35:01.284
of abandonment issues combined
with a psycho-sexual thrill

35:01.362 --> 35:02.449
derived from butchering.

35:02.474 --> 35:03.807
He's a mix of Gacy and Dahmer.

35:03.847 --> 35:06.276
Mark must have had a
long-simmering desire to kill

35:06.301 --> 35:08.214
that he sublimated by controlling Bill.

35:08.268 --> 35:11.097
Till Bill was out the door,
threatening filing for divorce.

35:11.175 --> 35:13.087
That had to be the trigger
for the first murder.

35:13.112 --> 35:16.065
The discovery of the torso must have
scared Bill back into Mark's arms.

35:16.159 --> 35:17.495
But it was only temporary.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.378
No matter how frightened Bill
was, he knew Mark wouldn't change.

35:20.483 --> 35:22.534
That's why Mark escalated to overkill

35:22.612 --> 35:24.597
and started displaying
bodies in more public ways.

35:24.651 --> 35:26.924
The more indecisive Bill was
about getting back together,

35:26.957 --> 35:29.345
the more Mark tried to force
him back home with fear.

35:29.392 --> 35:31.118
They started out as rage kills

35:31.143 --> 35:33.862
but evolved into a more extreme
form of coercive control.

35:33.972 --> 35:36.079
A final rejection highly increases

35:36.104 --> 35:39.018
the risk of death to the
partner in cases like this.

35:39.573 --> 35:40.676
Let me go!

35:40.817 --> 35:43.121
You should have thought of that
before you rubbed up on Wesley.

35:43.145 --> 35:45.925
What are you talking
about? I never cheated.

35:47.597 --> 35:49.196
You killed him.

35:51.276 --> 35:53.472
Oh, you killed them all, didn't you?

35:53.643 --> 35:55.628
Uhh! Ohh...

35:55.865 --> 35:57.240
This is all your fault.

35:57.386 --> 35:59.573
You broke the rules.

36:26.456 --> 36:28.349
This is your fault.

36:29.338 --> 36:30.979
All your fault.

36:31.107 --> 36:34.396
No. Mark, you love me.

36:35.177 --> 36:37.220
You... you...

36:37.267 --> 36:38.742
That's why I need to do this.

36:38.943 --> 36:42.570
I need you to hurt the way I hurt.

37:05.833 --> 37:07.349
FBI!

37:07.513 --> 37:10.029
Drop it and show me your hands.

37:17.591 --> 37:19.669
It's ok. It's over.

37:19.694 --> 37:21.747
You're ok.

37:22.145 --> 37:24.421
Oh, my God. He was... oh, my God.

37:24.468 --> 37:26.880
Is there someone we can call for you?

37:26.953 --> 37:28.521
We're still married.

37:29.263 --> 37:31.450
You can't say a word to them.

37:32.115 --> 37:34.638
They'll never prove anything!

37:50.240 --> 37:51.695
Your husband's wrong.

37:51.818 --> 37:54.810
Marital privilege only applies
to words spoken between spouses.

37:54.849 --> 37:56.466
So I can testify against him?

37:56.513 --> 37:59.723
Legally, you can describe every
detail of what Mark did to you.

37:59.880 --> 38:02.802
You just can't say what he
confessed about other victims.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.533
Thank you.

38:04.615 --> 38:07.798
I want to make sure that he
never hurts another person.

38:08.521 --> 38:10.443
I knew something was wrong,

38:10.638 --> 38:12.497
but I... I never suspected
anything like this.

38:12.522 --> 38:13.465
You shouldn't have.

38:13.490 --> 38:16.310
But I thought that I
had found true love.

38:16.435 --> 38:19.042
I was so happy to get married.

38:19.521 --> 38:21.124
Now this.

38:21.606 --> 38:22.655
I'm such a fool.

38:22.700 --> 38:25.552
Bill, we see in others
what we want to see,

38:25.677 --> 38:28.404
and you trusted him, because
you're a trustworthy person.

38:28.529 --> 38:31.365
I tried so hard to be a better person,

38:31.513 --> 38:32.802
to make it work with Mark.

38:32.849 --> 38:34.786
That's the insidious
nature of coercive control.

38:34.833 --> 38:37.427
Victims oftentimes don't even
realize they're being manipulated

38:37.474 --> 38:39.505
and they blame themselves.

38:39.583 --> 38:42.099
I'll never feel safe in there again.

38:56.786 --> 38:59.107
How you doing?

38:59.608 --> 39:01.669
You know, Bill thought
he found true love,

39:01.732 --> 39:03.420
but it turns out he
didn't really even know

39:03.467 --> 39:05.552
the... person he was married to.

39:05.630 --> 39:09.150
Which got me thinking, do
we ever really know anyone?

39:09.607 --> 39:13.263
Well, that, my friend, is the
question that keeps us in business.

39:13.427 --> 39:14.818
I suppose it does.

39:14.942 --> 39:16.890
Spence...

39:17.394 --> 39:19.888
I know you've been under a lot of stress

39:20.029 --> 39:21.675
with your mom living
at the apartment.

39:21.700 --> 39:22.996
But I've known you long
enough to know

39:23.020 --> 39:25.622
there's something more going on.

39:26.271 --> 39:28.786
I really thought that
bringing her home with me

39:28.818 --> 39:30.313
was the best plan, but I don't know.

39:30.360 --> 39:32.380
I feel like now I...

39:32.575 --> 39:34.661
I made a mistake. It's
not really working.

39:34.802 --> 39:38.768
People and circumstances
change unexpectedly.

39:39.255 --> 39:42.685
We need to learn how
to adapt and regroup

39:42.758 --> 39:44.604
and go on.

39:50.286 --> 39:51.771
I might need to take a few days.

39:51.833 --> 39:54.529
I'm gonna fly to Houston
and talk to Dr. Stanfield.

39:54.669 --> 39:57.198
Sure. Take as much time as you need.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.411
Thanks.

40:00.544 --> 40:02.392
Spencer.

40:03.196 --> 40:05.966
I couldn't be more proud of you.

40:06.741 --> 40:07.995
Why?

40:08.919 --> 40:11.668
Because it's difficult
caring for family.

40:12.021 --> 40:15.146
But it takes tremendous
strength to ask for help.

40:23.122 --> 40:26.450
“Nothing is more sad
than the death of an illusion.”

40:26.569 --> 40:28.099
Arthur Koestler.
