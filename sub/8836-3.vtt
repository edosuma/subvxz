WEBVTT

01:19.539 --> 01:24.335
Lars: <i>JA</i>, I TOLD HIM,
I SAID, "MR. SPRAGUE,

01:24.502 --> 01:28.381
I'M GOING TO BUILD
YOUR BANK JUST LIKE
IT WAS MY OWN HOUSE."

01:28.548 --> 01:30.508
AND HE SAID TO ME,

01:30.675 --> 01:32.635
HE SAID--HA HA HA'.

01:32.802 --> 01:34.846
"IT'S GOT TO BE
BETTER THAN THAT'."

01:35.013 --> 01:36.055
HA HA'.

01:36.222 --> 01:39.058
EBENEZER SPRAGUE--
EVEN SOUNDS LIKE
A BANKER.

01:39.225 --> 01:40.602
AH, WELL, HE'S
NOT GOING TO BE

01:40.769 --> 01:43.021
AN EASY MAN TO
GET ALONG WITH,
YOU KNOW?

01:43.188 --> 01:47.275
BUT WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN HIS SOCIAL GRACES.

01:47.442 --> 01:50.570
WELL, NOT AS LONG AS
HE CAN HELP US GET
TO THE NEXT HARVEST.

01:50.737 --> 01:54.032
YEAH, I TOLD HIM THAT.
I SAID, "MR. SPRAGUE,

01:54.199 --> 01:57.243
"THE FARMERS AROUND
HERE HAD A VERY,
VERY BAD YEAR.

01:57.410 --> 02:03.041
THEY'RE GONNA NEED
MONEY FOR SEED AND
FOR NEW EQUIPMENT."

02:03.208 --> 02:05.293
AND NOT TO MENTION
FIXING UP
OLD EQUIPMENT.

02:05.460 --> 02:08.505
YEAH, I TOLD
HIM THAT, TOO.

02:08.671 --> 02:10.006
I SAID,
"MR. SPRAGUE,

02:10.173 --> 02:14.844
YOU ARE GOING TO BE
A WELCOME BLESSING
IN WALNUT GROVE."

02:16.054 --> 02:18.056
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID,

02:18.223 --> 02:20.433
"I AM NOT
A BLESSING.
I'M A BANKER."

02:20.600 --> 02:23.436
HEH HEH HEH HEH'.

02:23.603 --> 02:25.104
THEN HE SAID
SOMETHING ELSE, TOO.

02:25.271 --> 02:28.274
HE SAID THAT THE
BUILDING HAD TO BE
FINISHED IN 21 DAYS.

02:28.441 --> 02:30.109
THAT'S WHEN
HE GETS HERE.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.820
IF WE ARE NOT READY,

02:31.986 --> 02:37.575
THEN I HAVE TO PAY
A PENALTY FOR EVERY
DAY WE ARE LATE.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.953
WE'LL HAVE IT READY.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.663
Lars:
YOU BET YOU.

02:41.830 --> 02:42.872
HE BETTER
BE READY, TOO.

02:43.039 --> 02:44.290
WHEN THIS BANK
IS FINISHED,

02:44.457 --> 02:48.127
IT'S GONNA BE
THE BUSIEST SPOT
IN WALNUT GROVE.

03:08.648 --> 03:10.859
LAURA, HAVE YOU
FINISHED YOUR HOMEWORK?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.318
Laura: ALMOST, MA.

03:12.485 --> 03:13.653
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:13.820 --> 03:17.532
WELL, MAKING
DOUGH BALLS OUT OF
THE LEFTOVER BREAD

03:17.699 --> 03:18.658
FOR FISHING BAIT.

03:18.825 --> 03:20.785
THAT'S VERY FRUGAL
OF YOU, LAURA,

03:20.952 --> 03:22.203
BUT I THINK YOU'LL
BE NEEDING THE HOMEWORK

03:22.370 --> 03:23.580
BEFORE YOU
NEED THE BAIT.

03:23.746 --> 03:25.456
I'M ALREADY
ON PROBLEM 3.

03:25.623 --> 03:28.418
YOU BETTER HURRY
SO WE CAN TURN THE PAGE
AT THE SAME TIME.

03:31.588 --> 03:32.797
WELL, I THINK
I CAN DO IT.

03:32.964 --> 03:34.340
Caroline:
DO WHAT, CHARLES?

03:34.507 --> 03:35.717
FARM 40 MORE ACRES.

03:35.884 --> 03:38.428
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA
GET 40 MORE ACRES?

03:38.595 --> 03:40.513
I'M GONNA
BUY THEM.

03:41.514 --> 03:43.433
YOU'RE SITTING THERE
THIS VERY MINUTE

03:43.600 --> 03:46.853
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW WE'RE GONNA HOLD ON
TO THE LAND WE HAVE NOW.

03:47.020 --> 03:49.355
HOW IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU GONNA BUY
40 MORE ACRES?

03:49.522 --> 03:53.818
I THOUGHT
I'D TAKE A LOAN
FROM THE BANK.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.907
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU
NEVER WANTED TO BE OWING
TO ANYBODY AGAIN, EVER.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.533
I KNOW WHAT I SAID,
CAROLINE,

04:00.700 --> 04:02.368
BUT MANKATO'S
GROWING ALL THE TIME.

04:02.535 --> 04:04.913
THAT POPULATION
HAS DOUBLED. I DON'T
THINK IT'S GONNA STOP.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.373
AND THOSE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO NEED FOOD.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.709
I CAN SELL EVERYTHING
I CAN HARVEST.

04:09.876 --> 04:12.170
WELL, YOU'LL SAVE
SOME FOR US TO EAT,
WON'T YOU, PA?

04:12.337 --> 04:14.422
HEY, DON'T WORRY.
MY FAMILY GETS
PICK OF THE CROP.

04:14.589 --> 04:16.132
AND I THINK EVERY FARMER
AROUND HERE IS GONNA EXPAND.

04:16.299 --> 04:18.468
I DON'T WANT
TO BE LEFT OUT.

04:18.635 --> 04:21.804
MR. SPRAGUE COMES INTO
TOWN, HE AND I ARE GONNA
TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.724
Laura: PA SURE
LEFT THE HOUSE
EARLY THIS MORNING.

04:24.891 --> 04:26.935
Mary: HE AND
MR. HANSON HAVE TO
FINISH THE BANK TODAY.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.646
I HOPE THE BANK
GIVES PA A LOAN.

04:29.812 --> 04:30.813
HOW DO BANKS
MAKE MONEY

04:30.980 --> 04:33.024
IF THEY JUST GIVE
IT TO OTHER FOLKS?

04:33.191 --> 04:34.275
INTEREST.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.194
SURE, I'M INTERESTED.
THAT'S WHY I ASKED.

04:36.361 --> 04:38.321
NO, SILLY.
I SAID INTEREST.

04:38.488 --> 04:40.490
YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK
MORE THAN YOU BORROW.

04:40.657 --> 04:41.616
REALLY?

04:41.783 --> 04:42.575
YEP.

04:42.742 --> 04:44.369
MARY, DO YOU
HAVE ANY MONEY?

04:44.535 --> 04:45.912
NO. WHY?

04:46.079 --> 04:48.790
I WAS THINKING I MIGHT
LOAN YOU A PENNY.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.259
[HAMMERING]

05:00.426 --> 05:01.511
DON'T UNLOAD YET.

05:01.678 --> 05:02.553
BUT I HAVE
TO GET ON BACK.

05:02.720 --> 05:03.763
JUST WAIT HERE.

05:03.930 --> 05:05.556
[HAMMERING]

05:13.898 --> 05:17.902
HELLO,
MR. SPRAGUE'.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.739
PRACTICALLY
SANDED IT TO A SHINE.

05:21.906 --> 05:25.451
TOOK THE WHOLE MORNING.
HA HA HA'.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.415
OH, THAT IS SOLID
AS A ROCK.

05:30.581 --> 05:37.422
IT'LL STAND AS LONG
AS THE BANK. HA HA HA'.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.840
[STOMPS FOOT]

05:39.007 --> 05:40.091
[STOMPS FOOT]

05:40.258 --> 05:43.636
THE BEAMS ARE
12 INCHES APART. HA'.

05:53.396 --> 05:56.190
A REAL BARRELFUL
OF LAUGHS, ISN'T HE?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.442
YEAH.

06:11.164 --> 06:15.501
I'LL, UH, HAVE TO
TAKE OFF ONE DAY
FOR NONCOMPLETION.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.588
MR. SPRAGUE,
YOU SAID 21 DAYS.

06:18.755 --> 06:22.216
THE 22nd DAY
OF THE MONTH, AND
TODAY IS THE 22nd.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.594
THE CONTRACT CLEARLY
STATES THE BUILDING

06:24.761 --> 06:27.597
WILL BE COMPLETED
AT 12 NOON ON THE 22nd.

06:27.764 --> 06:30.933
IT IS NOW EXACTLY...

06:31.100 --> 06:33.603
12:48. YOU ARE
48 MINUTES LATE.

06:33.770 --> 06:37.023
THE CONTRACT ALSO STATES
THAT THE WAGON OUTSIDE
WILL BE UNLOADED BY YOU.

06:37.190 --> 06:39.525
YOUR PAYMENT IS DUE
AT 12 NOON TOMORROW.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.611
THE MONEY WILL BE
READY AND WAITING.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.253
OVER THERE.

07:01.506 --> 07:03.341
OVER HERE.

07:08.930 --> 07:09.847
THAT'S THE LOT
OF IT.

07:10.014 --> 07:12.016
GOOD.

07:22.318 --> 07:25.530
SOMETHING,
MR. INGALLS?

07:25.696 --> 07:27.782
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT I KNOW YOU
HAD A LONG TRIP,

07:27.949 --> 07:29.408
AND THIS BEING YOUR
FIRST NIGHT IN TOWN,

07:29.575 --> 07:31.536
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE TIRED AND LIKE
A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.412
I'D LIKE TO INVITE
YOU TO MY PLACE
FOR SUPPER.

07:33.579 --> 07:35.414
WHY?

07:35.581 --> 07:36.541
PARDON ME?

07:36.707 --> 07:39.752
WHY WOULD YOU WANT
TO INVITE ME FOR SUPPER?

07:39.919 --> 07:42.296
WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID.
YOU HAD A LONG TRIP, I
FIGURED YOU WERE TIRED--

07:42.463 --> 07:44.006
MR. INGALLS,

07:44.173 --> 07:47.468
I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE
OF MYSELF FOR A GREAT
MANY YEARS JUST FINE.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.720
TONIGHT WILL BE
NO DIFFERENT. GOOD DAY.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.270
HAVE A NICE EVENING.

07:59.230 --> 08:01.941
AH, THE SMELL OF INK
AND MONEY HAS SOURED
THE MAN,

08:02.108 --> 08:03.651
BUT A BANK
IS A BANK,

08:03.818 --> 08:05.444
AND THAT'S
WHAT WE NEED.

08:05.611 --> 08:06.737
WE NEED IT.

08:06.904 --> 08:10.491
YEAH, SO WE TAKE
THE BAD ALONG
WITH THE GOOD.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.369
Caroline: MISS BEADLE
SAYS THAT EVERY CHILD,

08:13.536 --> 08:16.122
NO MATTER HOW POOR,
SHOULD HAVE A TEXTBOOK.

08:16.289 --> 08:18.499
I THINK
SHE'S PERFECTLY RIGHT.

08:18.666 --> 08:22.753
YOU TAKE MARY
AND LAURA, FOR EXAMPLE.

08:22.920 --> 08:26.174
MARY'S ALWAYS HAVING
TO HOLD HERSELF BACK.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.676
AND LAURA,
SHE RUSHES SO MUCH,

08:28.843 --> 08:31.429
SHE DOESN'T GET THE MOST
OUT OF THE LESSONS.

08:31.596 --> 08:34.724
AND THEY'RE
THE LUCKY ONES.

08:34.891 --> 08:36.475
I'D LIKE TO HELP
MISS BEADLE.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.895
I'M TRYING TO THINK
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

08:41.814 --> 08:43.691
CHARLES...

08:43.858 --> 08:48.112
ARE YOU STILL STEWING
OVER THAT MR. SPRAGUE?

08:48.279 --> 08:50.907
YEAH, I GUESS I AM.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.658
IMAGINE THAT MAN
THINKING I INVITED
HIM TO DINNER

08:52.825 --> 08:54.327
JUST SO I COULD
GET SOMETHING FROM HIM.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.913
WELL, YOU KNOW
YOU DIDN'T INVITE
HIM OVER

08:57.079 --> 08:58.664
JUST TO GET
ON HIS GOOD SIDE,

08:58.831 --> 09:01.876
NO MATTER
WHAT HE THINKS.

09:02.043 --> 09:04.212
THAT'S TRUE.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.339
YOU INVITED HIM
OVER FOR DINNER

09:06.505 --> 09:12.511
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT PEOPLE DO
FOR NEW NEIGHBORS.

09:12.678 --> 09:15.348
SOME NEW NEIGHBOR.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.225
BET HE DOESN'T
HAVE MANY FRIENDS.

09:17.391 --> 09:21.354
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE ONE.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.855
COURSE, MAYBE WE'RE
BEING TOO HARD WITH HIM.

09:23.022 --> 09:24.565
MAYBE IT'S JUST 'CAUSE
HE'S NEW IN TOWN.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.526
OH, I HOPE SO.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.613
I WOULDN'T LIKE HIM
TO ACT THAT WAY
ALL THE TIME.

09:30.780 --> 09:34.367
ME NEITHER. I HAVE TO GO
IN THE BANK TOMORROW AND
ASK HIM FOR THE LOAN.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.118
I KNOW.

09:36.285 --> 09:37.912
OH, WELL.
GET SOME SLEEP.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.050
CAROLINE,
YOU KNOW WHAT'S
REALLY BOTHERING ME?

09:51.217 --> 09:52.551
YES.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.599
YOU'RE AFRAID YOU DID
INVITE HIM OVER JUST
TO GET ON HIS GOOD SIDE.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.059
HA'.

10:01.519 --> 10:03.062
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.648
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:07.817 --> 10:10.403
I THINK
YOU'RE ONLY HUMAN.

10:19.954 --> 10:20.955
SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

10:21.122 --> 10:22.206
MMM.

10:31.132 --> 10:33.175
I DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG I'M GONNA BE.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.094
IF YOU GET THROUGH HERE,
WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME
OVER AT THE BANK?

10:35.261 --> 10:36.721
ALL RIGHT.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.056
COURSE, IF YOU'D RATHER
WHILE AWAY THE TIME
WITH MRS. OLESON...

10:39.223 --> 10:40.975
I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH
TO SAY TO MRS. OLESON.

10:41.142 --> 10:42.101
I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE BANK.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.352
ALL RIGHT.

10:47.273 --> 10:49.650
OH, IT MUST
BE SO DIFFICULT

10:49.817 --> 10:53.279
FOR A MAN LIKE
MR. SPRAGUE, A MAN
OF HIS QUALITY,

10:53.446 --> 10:56.532
TO HAVE TO LIVE
SIDE BY SIDE WITH
COUNTRY FOLKS.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.368
LORD KNOWS HOW HARD
IT IS ON ME.

10:59.535 --> 11:00.786
NO MATTER HOW LONG
I LIVE HERE,

11:00.953 --> 11:02.330
I DON'T THINK I'LL
EVER GET USED TO IT.

11:02.496 --> 11:05.791
COURSE, WHEN QUALITY
IS INBORN...HA HA'.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.586
THAT WAS 3 DOZEN,
WASN'T IT, MRS. OLESON?

11:08.753 --> 11:12.465
HMM? OH, YES. YES.
3 DOZEN EXACTLY.
IS THAT CREDIT OR CASH?

11:12.631 --> 11:13.924
CASH, PLEASE.
ALL RIGHT.

11:18.095 --> 11:22.641
I THINK I SHOULD
INVITE MR. SPRAGUE
FOR DINNER.

11:22.808 --> 11:27.313
I THINK HE WOULD
APPRECIATE A NICE
HOME-COOKED MEAL...

11:27.480 --> 11:30.316
AND PARTICULARLY
WITH HIS OWN KIND.

11:30.483 --> 11:32.151
IF YOU WOULD JUST
PAY ME, MRS. OLESON,
PLEASE,

11:32.318 --> 11:33.903
MY HUSBAND'S WAITING
FOR ME AT THE BANK.
THANK YOU.

11:34.070 --> 11:37.990
OH'.? OH, WELL, UH,
I'LL WALK OVER THERE
WITH YOU.

11:38.157 --> 11:41.035
AH, HA'. IF YOU CAN
JUST WAIT ONE MINUTE
FOR ME NOW.

11:41.202 --> 11:42.995
I WAS PLANNING
ON GOING OVER
A LITTLE LATER,

11:43.162 --> 11:45.498
SO I BROUGHT SOME
OF MY THINGS DOWN,
BECAUSE AFTER ALL,

11:45.664 --> 11:49.460
YOU KNOW I REALLY
CAN'T GO OVER LOOKING
LIKE A SHOPKEEPER.

11:49.627 --> 11:51.712
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH
I AM ONE, IT REALLY
DOESN'T--I MEAN,

11:51.879 --> 11:53.881
IT ISN'T--YOU KNOW,
FOR A MAN WHO IS
SO IMPORTANT

11:54.048 --> 11:56.759
AS MR. SPRAGUE IS.

11:56.926 --> 12:00.054
NOW, I'VE GOT
EVERYTHING...YES, YES.

12:00.221 --> 12:01.514
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WELL
COME ALONG, MRS.INGALLS.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.016
WE MUSTN'T KEEP
MR. SPRAGUE WAITING.

12:15.361 --> 12:16.529
THIS IS, UH,

12:16.695 --> 12:18.322
REALLY NOT VERY MUCH
LAND, MR. INGALLS,

12:18.489 --> 12:20.408
NOT ENOUGH
FOR COLLATERAL.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.243
WELL, IT'S NOT JUST
THE LAND, MR. SPRAGUE,

12:22.410 --> 12:23.869
IT'S WHAT I'VE DONE
WITH IT. I'VE GOT
A CROP COMING UP.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.288
I HEARD LAST YEAR'S
WASN'T VERY GOOD.

12:26.455 --> 12:27.915
WELL, WE HAD A BAD
WINTER LAST YEAR,

12:28.082 --> 12:29.458
BUT NEXT YEAR
IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.879
I CANNOT USE NEXT
YEAR FOR COLLATERAL,
MR. INGALLS.

12:34.046 --> 12:35.506
WELL, MR. SPRAGUE,
I'M A HARDWORKING MAN.

12:35.673 --> 12:38.134
I'VE GOT A GOOD NAME
IN THIS TOWN.
YOU CAN ASK ANYBODY.

12:38.300 --> 12:41.053
NOR CAN I PUT
YOUR GOOD NAME
IN MY SAFE, SIR.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.223
WELL, I'M NOT
ASKING FOR CHARITY,
I'M ASKING FOR A LOAN.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.475
Mrs. Oleson: HELLO'.

12:46.642 --> 12:51.564
WELCOME TO WALNUT GROVE,
MR. SPRAGUE.

12:51.730 --> 12:55.151
I'M MRS. OLESON
OF OLESON'S
MERCANTILE COMPANY,

12:55.317 --> 12:56.402
JUST ACROSS THE WAY.

12:56.569 --> 12:57.820
HOW DO YOU DO,
MRS. OLESON?
I'M RIGHT--

12:57.987 --> 13:00.281
I WANTED TO MEET YOU
BEFORE YOU GOT THE NOTION

13:00.448 --> 13:03.701
THAT THERE WAS

TO CONTRIBUTE--

27:05.917 --> 27:08.253
NO.

27:08.420 --> 27:12.507
MR. SPRAGUE, THE ENTIRE
FUTURE OF AMERICA IS
DEPENDENT UPON THE CHILDREN.

27:12.674 --> 27:14.551
IT IS THE DUTY
OF EVERY CITIZEN--

27:14.718 --> 27:16.261
MY ONLY DUTY

27:16.428 --> 27:22.267
IS TO RUN AN HONEST
BANK AND MAKE A FAIR
PROFIT FOR MYSELF.

27:22.434 --> 27:23.351
BUT THE CHILDREN--

27:23.518 --> 27:24.602
CHILDREN WILL
GROW UP WITHOUT BOOKS.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.104
I DID, AND DID
VERY WELL, THANK YOU,

27:26.271 --> 27:27.939
AND NO ONE
CONTRIBUTED A THING.

27:28.106 --> 27:30.233
GOOD DAY, MRS. INGALLS.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.486
GOOD DAY.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.001
HELLO'.

TRYING MY SPOT TODAY.

YOU'D TRY SOME OF
MY DOUGH BALLS, MISTER.

WELL, IT'S JUST THAT
THE FISH IN OUR POND

ALL THAT FANCY STUFF.

29:05.578 --> 29:06.996
JUST TRY IT,

YOU CAN'T HAVE
ANY WORSE LUCK THAN
YOU'RE HAVING NOW.

29:09.416 --> 29:13.211
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
AS LONG AS IT'LL STOP
YOU PESTERING ME.

29:20.093 --> 29:21.511
OUCH'.
OOH, YOU HURT
YOURSELF.

29:21.678 --> 29:24.514
I DID NOT
HURT MYSELF.

29:24.681 --> 29:26.224
MAYBE I BETTER
BAIT THE HOOK.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.351
I KNOW
HOW TO BAIT A HOOK.

[JACK BARKING]

30:02.927 --> 30:05.263
Mr. Sprague:
NOW, I THOUGHT I HAD
THAT BOAT WELL ANCHORED,

30:05.430 --> 30:11.227
BUT THAT FISH--THAT FISH
WAS SO STRONG THAT HE
PULLED THE ANCHOR LOOSE.

30:11.394 --> 30:12.896
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,

30:13.062 --> 30:16.483
I WAS RIDING ALONG
ON THE CURRENT, HEADING
RIGHT FOR THE RAPIDS.

30:16.649 --> 30:17.942
OH...

30:18.109 --> 30:21.279
I KNEW THAT RIVER,
AND I KNEW THAT IF I
GOT IN THOSE RAPIDS,

30:21.446 --> 30:22.822
IT WAS GONNA CARRY ME
AROUND THE BEND,

30:22.989 --> 30:25.575
AND I KNEW WHAT
WAS AROUND THE BEND, TOO.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.035
WHAT?

30:27.202 --> 30:29.162
A 20-FOOT WATERFALL.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.455
OH, MY GOODNESS.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.915
WHAT DID YOU DO?

30:32.081 --> 30:34.459
WELL, UH, THERE WAS
A TREE GROWING NEXT
TO THE RIVER,

30:34.626 --> 30:38.463
AND I JUST REACHED UP
AND GOT A HOLD OF A LIMB
AND KIND OF HUNG ON.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.256
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO
LOSE THAT BOAT, YOU SEE.

30:40.423 --> 30:42.091
THAT BOAT COST ME
A LOT OF MONEY.

30:42.258 --> 30:46.721
SO, I, UH, I HOOKED
MY FEET UNDER THE SEAT,
CURLED UP MY TOES,

30:46.888 --> 30:48.640
AND THEN
I REALLY HUNG ON.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.808
YOU MUST HAVE
STRONG TOES.

30:50.975 --> 30:53.603
[LAUGHING]
I DO, I REALLY DO.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.897
HERE'S WHERE I
GET OFF.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.735
WHOA.

31:00.902 --> 31:01.986
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

31:02.153 --> 31:03.655
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE DOUGH BALLS.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.156
YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:05.323 --> 31:07.492
I'M SORRY THAT JACK
CHASED YOUR HORSE
THAT FIRST DAY.

31:07.659 --> 31:09.160
HE JUST HAD TO
GET USED TO HIM,
THAT'S ALL.

31:09.327 --> 31:12.539
WELL, I'M SORRY
I WAS SO GROUCHY
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.666
SEE,
IT'S THE SAME THING.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.960
WE JUST HAD TO
GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER, RIGHT?

31:17.126 --> 31:18.002
RIGHT.

31:18.169 --> 31:19.587
WILL YOU BE FISHING
AGAIN TOMORROW?

31:19.754 --> 31:21.798
YOU BRING THE DOUGH
BALLS TOMORROW?

31:21.965 --> 31:23.716
I WILL.
SEE YOU THEN.

31:23.883 --> 31:24.759
SEE YOU THEN.

31:24.926 --> 31:25.802
BYE.

31:25.969 --> 31:28.304
BYE-BYE.
TCH, TCH.
GIDDYAP, BOY.

31:39.190 --> 31:40.441
AND IT WAS A GOOD THING

31:40.608 --> 31:42.360
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR
A PLACE TO CAMP THAT NIGHT,

31:42.527 --> 31:44.571
AND THAT THEY PICKED
THAT VERY SPOT,

31:44.737 --> 31:47.657
OR HE WOULD HAVE NEVER
COME OFF OF THAT TREE.

31:47.824 --> 31:49.117
DID HE SAVE
THE BOAT?

31:49.284 --> 31:50.702
HE SURE DID.

31:50.868 --> 31:53.413
HE LOST ONE OF THE OARS,
BUT HE SAVED THE BOAT.

31:53.580 --> 31:55.331
NOW, I WISH I DID
GO FISHING WITH YOU.

31:55.498 --> 31:57.458
OH, HE'LL BE BACK.
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS NOW.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.711
WE'RE GONNA GO FISHING
TOGETHER A LOT.

31:59.877 --> 32:01.170
HE'S SO NICE.

32:01.337 --> 32:04.090
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
INTRODUCE YOUR FRIEND
TO MR. SPRAGUE.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.009
PERHAPS SOME
OF THE NICENESS
WOULD RUB OFF.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.428
WHEN WERE YOU TALKING
TO MR. SPRAGUE?

32:08.595 --> 32:14.100
I WENT INTO HIS BANK TODAY
TO SOLICIT A DONATION
FOR THE SCHOOLBOOK FUND.

32:14.267 --> 32:15.727
HE TURNED ME DOWN FLAT.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.353
BUT HE MUST BE
THE RICHEST MAN
IN WALNUT GROVE'.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.147
I'M SURE HE IS.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.732
BUT HE SAID NOBODY
BOUGHT BOOKS FOR HIM

32:20.898 --> 32:22.900
AND THAT HE WASN'T BUYING
BOOKS FOR ANYBODY ELSE.

32:23.067 --> 32:27.155
AND BEFORE I COULD EVEN
TELL HIM WHY I WAS THERE,

32:27.322 --> 32:31.242
HE ACCUSED ME
OF COMING BEGGING
FOR YOUR LOAN, CHARLES.

32:31.409 --> 32:34.078
"WILES OF A WOMAN,"
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.039
WHAT'S WILES?

32:37.248 --> 32:39.334
SOMETHING YOUR
MOTHER NEVER USES.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.753
OH, PLEASE, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HIM.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.212
ALL RIGHT. I WON'T
SAY ANYTHING,

32:43.379 --> 32:45.214
BUT I DON'T
WANT YOU GOING
IN THAT BANK AGAIN.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.550
YOU CAN BE SURE
I WON'T.

32:48.593 --> 32:51.095
MAYBE I SHOULD
INTRODUCE HIM TO MY FRIEND.

32:51.262 --> 32:54.724
MAYBE SOME OF THE NICENESS
WILL RUB OFF.

32:54.891 --> 32:59.228
HALF-PINT, I DON'T THINK
ANYTHING'D HELP MR. SPRAGUE.

33:08.988 --> 33:11.616
MISS BEADLE SURE
LOOKED SAD TODAY...

33:11.783 --> 33:13.284
SHE SURE DID.

33:13.451 --> 33:15.411
AND IT'S ALL THAT
MR. SPRAGUE'S FAULT.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.789
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GIVE
TO THE BOOK FUND IF HE WON'T.

33:17.955 --> 33:19.791
HE HAS A WHOLE BANK
FULL OF MONEY.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.043
YOU'D EXPECT HE COULD
GIVE JUST A LITTLE.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.671
MA SAYS MEANNESS SHOWS
ON A PERSON'S FACE.

33:24.837 --> 33:27.924
HE MUST BE
THE MEANEST-LOOKING MAN
IN WALNUT GROVE.

33:28.091 --> 33:32.303
YOU EVER SEE HIM?
NO.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.515
ME, NEITHER, AND I
SURE DON'T WANT TO.

33:35.682 --> 33:36.933
WELL,

33:37.100 --> 33:38.643
I GUESS WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO GO ON
SHARING OUR BOOKS.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.269
NO, WE WON'T.

33:40.436 --> 33:41.604
WHY NOT?

33:41.771 --> 33:43.856
'CAUSE I'M GOING
FISHING WITH MY FRIEND.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.733
IS THAT ALL YOU
EVER THINK ABOUT?

33:45.900 --> 33:46.943
JUST FISHING?

33:47.110 --> 33:49.737
NO. SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO THINK ABOUT RUNNING.

33:49.904 --> 33:51.781
COME ON.
I'LL RACE YOU HOME.

33:51.948 --> 33:54.158
[LAUGHING]

33:58.496 --> 34:00.331
Laura:
AND BECAUSE OF HIM,

34:00.498 --> 34:03.167
WE WON'T GET
OUR BOOKS FOR
A LONG, LONG TIME.

34:03.334 --> 34:04.335
MAYBE NEVER.

34:04.502 --> 34:05.962
Mr. Sprague:
MAYBE THE BANKER'S RIGHT.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.172
MAYBE THE FAMILY
SHOULD BUY THEIR
CHILDREN'S OWN BOOKS.

34:08.339 --> 34:10.216
DON'T YOU THINK THEY
WOULD IF THEY COULD?

34:10.383 --> 34:11.801
WELL, I THINK IF
SOMEONE WANTS SOMETHING,

34:11.968 --> 34:13.845
HE OUGHT TO WORK
VERY HARD TO GET IT.

34:14.011 --> 34:15.888
WELL, POOR FOLKS
WORK HARDER
THAN ANYBODY.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.015
THEY CAN'T HELP IT
IF THEY'RE POOR.

34:18.182 --> 34:19.642
IF YOU GIVE THINGS
TO FOLKS, THOUGH,

34:19.809 --> 34:21.769
SOMETIMES THEY GET
LAZY AND DON'T WANT
TO WORK AT ALL.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.980
NOT THE FOLKS
AROUND HERE.

34:24.147 --> 34:26.774
WELL, THIS BANKER--
YOU CAN'T RUN A BANK

34:26.941 --> 34:28.860
AND NOT JUST GIVE AWAY
MONEY TO EVERYBODY
THAT WANTS IT.

34:29.026 --> 34:31.320
I MEAN, HE'S JUST
BEING A GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.448
MAYBE SO,
BUT HE'S NOT BEING
A GOOD FRIEND,

34:33.614 --> 34:37.452
AND GOOD FRIENDS ARE
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
ANY OLD BUSINESS.

34:37.618 --> 34:38.703
YOU THINK SO?

34:38.870 --> 34:40.621
THAT'S
WHAT MY PA SAYS.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.957
HE SAYS WE
SHOULDN'T HATE
THE BANKER, EITHER.

34:43.124 --> 34:46.544
WE SHOULD
FEEL SORRY FOR HIM.

34:46.711 --> 34:47.920
WHY?

34:48.087 --> 34:51.716
WELL, BECAUSE
HE PROBABLY HASN'T
GOT ANY FRIENDS.

34:51.883 --> 34:55.720
"HAPPY IS A HOUSE
THAT SHELTERS
A FRIEND," PA SAYS.

34:55.887 --> 34:59.223
WELL, ACTUALLY,
RALPH WALDO EMERSON
SAID IT.

34:59.390 --> 35:01.476
YOU--YOU READ EMERSON?

35:01.642 --> 35:03.728
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S TOO HARD.

35:03.895 --> 35:06.314
MY PA READS IT
TO US.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.357
HE READS LOTS
OF THINGS TO US.

35:08.524 --> 35:10.026
BUT THAT'S
MY FAVORITE.

35:10.193 --> 35:12.528
BECAUSE IF
I CAN'T SLEEP,

35:12.695 --> 35:15.114
THEN I COULD
THINK ABOUT IT.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.157
HA HA HA'.

35:16.324 --> 35:17.241
HEY'. I GOT ONE'.

35:17.408 --> 35:18.534
SURE DID.

35:20.411 --> 35:21.454
OOH, HE'S A BIG ONE'.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.538
YEAH.

35:22.705 --> 35:23.748
PRETTY, TOO.
HA HA HA'.

35:23.915 --> 35:25.708
YEAH. HA HA HA'.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.384
SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO EAT SUPPER OVER
AT MY HOUSE?

35:35.551 --> 35:37.220
OH, I THINK I BETTER
BE GETTING BACK.

35:37.386 --> 35:38.346
BUT YOU SAID
YOU LIVED ALONE.

35:38.513 --> 35:40.556
WHAT'S THERE
TO GET BACK FOR?

35:40.723 --> 35:43.518
WELL, MAYBE
SOME OTHER TIME.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.102
DIDN'T YOU EVER
HAVE A FAMILY?

35:45.269 --> 35:48.022
HA HA HA'. WELL,
OF COURSE I DID,
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE BOY.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.024
NO, I MEAN
ONE OF YOUR OWN.

35:50.191 --> 35:54.111
NO, I--I NEVER
SEEM TO HAVE THE TIME.

35:54.278 --> 35:55.863
OH, IT DOESN'T
TAKE LONG.

35:56.030 --> 35:58.366
I'VE BEEN TO A WEDDING
IN CHURCH, AND IT JUST
TOOK A COUPLE MINUTES.

35:58.533 --> 36:03.704
NO, I DON'T MEAN THAT.
I MEAN THE COURTING
AND ALL THAT.

36:03.871 --> 36:06.999
WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T SPEND
ALL YOUR TIME FISHING.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.793
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SPEND IT COURTING.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.004
WELL, I THINK
IT'S A LITTLE LATE
FOR THAT NOW.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.631
OH, NO,
IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

36:13.798 --> 36:16.968
THERE'S A LOT OF
REALLY OLD LADIES
IN WALNUT GROVE.

36:17.134 --> 36:19.929
I BET SOME OF THEM ARE
EVEN OLDER THAN YOU ARE.

36:20.096 --> 36:23.182
HA HA'. I'M GLAD
TO HEAR THAT.

36:23.349 --> 36:24.433
TCH, TCH.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.402
Laura: COME ON,
MARY, HURRY UP.

36:34.569 --> 36:35.862
Mary: WHY ARE YOU
RUSHING SO, LAURA?

36:36.028 --> 36:37.530
I WANT TO GET
MY CHORES DONE.

36:37.697 --> 36:39.782
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU LOVED TO DO
YOUR CHORES SO MUCH.

36:39.949 --> 36:44.453
I HATE CHORES,
BUT I CAN'T GO FISHING
UNLESS I GET THEM DONE.

36:44.620 --> 36:47.290
HI'. I'LL BE THERE AFTER.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.003
HOW COME YOU'RE
NICE TO HIM?

36:52.169 --> 36:53.963
HE'S MY FRIEND.

36:54.130 --> 36:55.673
HE'S THE MEANEST MAN
IN WALNUT GROVE.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.174
HE IS NOT'.

36:57.341 --> 36:59.886
HE IS, TOO. HE WON'T
GIVE A PENNY TO
THE SCHOOLBOOK FUND,

37:00.052 --> 37:02.096
AND HE'S GOT MORE
MONEY THAN ANYBODY.

37:03.097 --> 37:04.557
YOU MEAN,
HE'S THE BANKER?

37:04.724 --> 37:07.518
OF COURSE.
THAT'S MEAN MR. SPRAGUE.

37:29.165 --> 37:30.458
I--I BEEN
WAITING FOR YOU.

37:30.625 --> 37:31.500
THEY'RE REALLY
BITING TODAY.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.711
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT ONE.

37:33.878 --> 37:37.006
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
WHO YOU WERE, MR. SPRAGUE?

37:40.384 --> 37:41.719
I--I--I DIDN'T
THINK IT MATTERED.

37:41.886 --> 37:44.722
WELL, IT DID.
I WAS TALKING TO YOU,

37:44.889 --> 37:46.682
AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
TELL ME IT WAS YOU,

37:46.849 --> 37:47.934
AND THAT ISN'T FAIR.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.227
WELL, I DIDN'T GET
YOUR NAME, EITHER.

37:50.394 --> 37:51.729
LAURA INGALLS.

37:51.896 --> 37:54.440
BUT I WASN'T
KEEPING IT A SECRET.

37:54.607 --> 37:58.069
INGALLS. YOU KNEW
VERY WELL WHO I WAS.

37:58.235 --> 38:01.113
I DIDN'T.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.032
EVERYONE KNOWS
WHO I AM.

38:03.199 --> 38:06.869
WELL, I DIDN'T.
ALL I KNEW IS THAT
YOU WERE MY FRIEND.

38:07.036 --> 38:09.205
YOU WERE MINE BECAUSE
YOU WANTED SOMETHING
FROM ME.

38:09.372 --> 38:11.749
YOU PA THOUGHT YOU
COULD SWEET-TALK ME
INTO GIVING HIM A LOAN.

38:11.916 --> 38:14.001
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

38:14.168 --> 38:18.506
YES, IT IS. NO ONE
TALKS TO ME UNLESS THEY
WANT SOMETHING FROM ME.

38:18.673 --> 38:21.133
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.178
I DID WANT
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

38:24.345 --> 38:28.766
I WANTED A BEST FRIEND
WHO'D WANT TO GO FISHING
AS MUCH AS I DID.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.560
BUT I DON'T ANYMORE.

38:31.727 --> 38:35.231
I'D RATHER
GO FISHING ALONE FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

39:05.386 --> 39:07.555
[WHISPERING]
Still can't sleep?

39:07.722 --> 39:10.307
No, sir.

39:10.474 --> 39:14.311
All I really wanted
was just to be his friend.

39:14.478 --> 39:17.314
I know that,
Half-pint.

39:17.481 --> 39:21.318
Then why wouldn't
he believe me?

39:21.485 --> 39:24.655
Well,
that's hard to say.

39:24.822 --> 39:29.160
Some folks just like
to think the worst
about other folks.

39:29.326 --> 39:32.830
Maybe he's just
afraid of being
hurt.

39:32.997 --> 39:34.623
I don't know
what you mean.

39:34.790 --> 39:38.961
Well, if you
never love someone,

39:39.128 --> 39:40.004
you never
have to worry about

39:40.171 --> 39:42.798
that person hurting you.

39:42.965 --> 39:44.592
Friends and loved ones

39:44.759 --> 39:47.970
are always the ones to
give you joy and sorrow.

39:51.182 --> 39:56.437
And Mr. Sprague is
really afraid of sorrow.

39:56.604 --> 39:59.565
That's right.

39:59.732 --> 40:02.902
But he won't ever
have any joy, either.

40:03.069 --> 40:05.279
I know.

40:05.446 --> 40:10.242
That's why you can't
go through this life
being afraid to love.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.536
'Cause without love,
there just--

40:12.703 --> 40:14.997
well, there just isn't
any reason for living.

40:29.261 --> 40:31.555
Now...

40:31.722 --> 40:33.015
why don't you try
closing your eyes

40:33.182 --> 40:37.103
and thinking about
all the people that
love you?

40:38.813 --> 40:39.897
All right.

41:31.448 --> 41:33.868
How is she?

41:34.034 --> 41:37.163
Well, she's asleep.

41:37.329 --> 41:41.208
Little tears still
drying on her cheeks.

41:41.375 --> 41:46.046
How could that man
accuse a child like that?

41:46.213 --> 41:49.300
I'm gonna
find out tomorrow.

41:49.466 --> 41:52.678
I'm gonna go in town
and have a nice talk
with Mr. Sprague.

42:02.897 --> 42:04.023
Charles: YAH'.

42:10.237 --> 42:12.156
WHOA'.

42:12.323 --> 42:14.783
THERE WE ARE.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.076
THANK YOU,
MR. SPRAGUE.

42:16.243 --> 42:17.203
I'LL BE HERE
WITH MORE NEXT WEEK.

MR. INGALLS.

42:19.872 --> 42:21.165
MR. TAYLOR.

42:21.332 --> 42:22.666
MR. INGALLS,
I'VE MADE A DECISION
REGARDING THE LOAN.

42:22.833 --> 42:24.585
I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT THE LOAN.

42:24.752 --> 42:27.046
I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT MY LITTLE GIRL
IS NOT A LIAR.

42:27.213 --> 42:28.547
WELL, I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.007
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

42:30.174 --> 42:31.717
NOW, YOU BROKE
THAT LITTLE GIRL'S HEART.

42:31.884 --> 42:33.636
SHE WENT DOWN
TO THAT POND EVERY DAY
TO SEE HER BEST FRIEND.

42:33.802 --> 42:35.095
THAT'S WHAT
SHE CALLED YOU--
HER BEST FRIEND.

42:35.262 --> 42:36.847
YES, BECAUSE SHE
WANTED ME TO LEND
YOU MONEY.

42:37.014 --> 42:39.183
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
THE SLIGHTEST IDEA
WHO YOU WERE.

42:39.350 --> 42:42.978
AND AS FOR THE LOAN,
I WOULDN'T TAKE IT IF IT
MEANT I'D LOSE EVERYTHING.

42:43.145 --> 42:44.563
MY LITTLE GIRL GAVE
SOMETHING TO YOU--
FRIENDSHIP--

42:44.730 --> 42:46.690
AND YOU TOOK IT AND
THREW IT RIGHT BACK
IN HER FACE.

42:46.857 --> 42:48.609
I DON'T NEED
ANY FRIENDS.

42:48.776 --> 42:51.445
WELL, THAT'S GOOD
FOR YOU, MR. SPRAGUE,
'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

42:54.615 --> 42:56.325
YOU KNOW,
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

42:56.492 --> 43:00.537
YOU CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING,
AND YOU CAN'T GIVE
ANYTHING EXCEPT MONEY.

43:00.704 --> 43:01.872
AND AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

43:02.039 --> 43:04.500
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING AT ALL.

ALL RIGHT,

DO THAT AT HOME.
