HUNTER, THE RODEO CLOWN, THE DOG

00:21.255 --> 00:25.393
AND RIGHT FROM THE JUMP, MEGAN

00:25.426 --> 00:26.727
STARTED RECRUITING ALLIES.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.064
>> I KIND OF FELT LIKE A GOOD
VIBE TOWARDS YOU, TOO.

00:30.098 --> 00:34.635
>> I LOVE THIS LITTLE GROUP OF
ODBALLS.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.671

THE SUMMER WAS COLD, HARD CASH.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.118
>> Julie: BE THE FIRST PERSON
TO PUSH YOUR BUTTON AND YOU WILL

00:50.151 --> 00:50.851
WIN $25,000.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.853
>> WHAT!

00:52.886 --> 00:56.624
>> Julie: ACCEPT IT, AND THE
FIRST TWIST OF THE SUMMER WILL

00:56.657 --> 00:59.026
BE RELEASED INTO THE GAME.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.063
>> AND KEVIN WAS FASTEST ON THE
TRIGGER FINGER, BUT EVERY

01:03.097 --> 01:05.866
TEMPTATION COMES WITH A
CONSEQUENCE.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.834
.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.669
>> OH!

01:08.702 --> 01:11.339
>> SORRY I'M LATE.

01:11.372 --> 01:16.344
>> AND "B.B. 18" FAN FAVORITE
WAS LAUNCHED IN THE HOUSE.

01:16.377 --> 01:21.849
>> WHICH ONE OF YOU WIT THE
APPLE.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.051
>> PAUL FROM SEASON 18 JUST
WALKED IN AND I AM FREAKING OUT.

01:24.084 --> 01:28.456
>> BUT JULIE CRASHED THE PARTY
WHEN SHE REVEALED THE FIRST-EVER

01:28.489 --> 01:29.657
"BIG BROTHER" SWAP.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.826
>> Julie: PAUL IS ACTUALLY
TAKING ONE OF YOUR PLACES IN THE

01:32.860 --> 01:33.227
GAME.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.362
>> OH, MY GOD!

01:34.395 --> 01:36.697
>> Julie: THAT MEANS ONE OF
YOU WILL BE EVICTED FROM THE

01:36.730 --> 01:38.966
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE TONIGHT.

01:38.999 --> 01:43.471
>> AND THE HOUSEGUESTS WERE
TASKED WITH TEMPTING PAUL FOR

01:43.504 --> 01:44.572
SAFETY.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.741
>> Julie: THERE ARE NINE
FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS INSIDE.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.976
>> OH, MY GOD.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.378
>> WHOA!

01:50.411 --> 01:52.313

PAUL.

01:52.346 --> 01:57.050
THE OTHER EIGHT BRACELETS YOU

01:57.084 --> 01:58.652
HOUSEGUESTS OF YOUR CHOICE.

01:58.686 --> 02:02.390

PITCHES--

02:02.423 --> 02:03.457
>> THIS IS A CHEESE SANDWICH.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.260
>> I AM A LOYAL, LOYAL PERSON.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.229
>> KEVIN I REMEMBERED YOUR NAME.

02:08.262 --> 02:12.099
>> HE SPREAD FRIENDSHIP TO EIGHT
LUCKY HOUSEGUESTS.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.734
>> CHEESE SANDWICH.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.403
>> ELENA THANK YOU.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.806

LIVES ON THE LINE, MATT,

02:18.839 --> 02:24.178

MEGAN, CAMERON AND ALEX WENT TO

02:24.212 --> 02:28.148
BATTLE.

02:28.182 --> 02:32.085
AND IN THE END, CHRISTMAS,

02:32.119 --> 02:35.323
JILLIAN, AND CAMERON WERE ON THE
BLOCK.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.691
AT THE NIGHT ONE EVICTION...

02:37.725 --> 02:42.463
>> Julie: WITH TWO VOTES TO
EVICT, CHRISTMAS, ARE YOU SAFE.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.600
>> THE MICROBIOLOGIST WAS SENT
BACK TO THE LAB.

02:46.634 --> 02:51.104
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 8-3,
CAMERON, YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

02:51.138 --> 02:54.107
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.778
>> TONIGHT, THE GAME KICKS INTO
GEAR WHEN THE FIRST HEAD OF

02:57.811 --> 02:59.012
HOUSEHOLD IS CROWNED.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.082
AND WITH NOMINATIONS LOOMING,
TENSIONS HIT A BOILING POINT.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.784
>> YOU'RE A SNAKE.

03:03.817 --> 03:04.685
OKAY.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.787
I'M TALKING-- YOU CAN TALK WHEN
I'M DONE.

03:06.820 --> 03:13.327
>> "THE SUMMER OF TEMPTATION"
HAS OFFICIALLY BEGUN.

03:13.361 --> 03:18.966
>> B.B. 19, BABY, B.B. 19.

03:18.999 --> 03:24.538
>> REALLY?

03:24.572 --> 03:27.641
REALLY, YOU'RE VOTING OUT
CAMERON?

03:27.675 --> 03:30.678
HAIRY CHEST NERD IS GETTING
VOTED OUT OVER THE COMPETITION

03:30.711 --> 03:31.845
BEAST CHRISTMAS?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.648
WOW, EVERYBODY IN THIS HOUSE IS
STUPID FOR NOT, OBVIOUSLY,

03:34.682 --> 03:35.849
VOTING OUT A STRONG PLAYER.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.019
>> THAT'S JUST, LIKE, NASTY TO
BE THERE.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.654
>> I COULDN'T EVEN LOOK.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.890
>> I GOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.993
THE VOTE ALLOWED ME TO KNOW HOW
MANY PEOPLE WANTED ME OUT FROM

03:46.026 --> 03:46.760
DAY ONE.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.829
NOW I KNOW, TWO.

03:48.862 --> 03:49.930
I'M COMING FOR YOU.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.500
I'LL FIND YOU.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.703
>> THAT WAS A BIG VOTE.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.103
8-3.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.338
THAT WAS BIG.

03:57.371 --> 04:00.508
>> I'M HAPPY AND GRATEFUL THAT I
AM SAFE THIS WEEK, BUT AT THE

04:00.541 --> 04:04.612
SAME TIME, IT'S SCARY TO THINK
THAT I WAS ALMOST EVICTED AFTER

04:04.645 --> 04:06.079
ONLY BEING IN THE HOUSE FOR A
FEW HOURS.

04:06.113 --> 04:06.947
>> OH, MY GOD.

04:06.980 --> 04:07.915
>> THANK YOU!

04:07.948 --> 04:09.850
>> CONGRATS!

04:09.883 --> 04:13.721
>> ONCE PEOPLE SEE YOU ON THE
BLOCK, IT'S ALMOST LIKE, OH,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.088
SHE'S COMFORTABLE BEING UP
THERE.

04:15.122 --> 04:21.028
NO, I'M NOT!

04:21.061 --> 04:22.663
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

04:22.696 --> 04:28.369
I WASN'T ON THE BLOCK AND MY
STOMACH WAS BRRR, AND MY NERVES

04:28.402 --> 04:30.003
WERE SHOT.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.038
OH, THIS IS INTENSE.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.741
I'M GETTING ANXIETY.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.477
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO BE IN
HERE.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.878
I NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.848
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A
VOTE LIKE THAT IN A WHILE.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.484
LIKE USUALLY IT'S COMPLETELY
UNANIMOUS.

04:43.517 --> 04:44.985
>> IT'S GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT
SEASON.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.087
>> ALL THE PEOPLE WHO PLAYED
BEFORE, I HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT

04:47.120 --> 04:48.889
FOR THEM.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.189
WOW.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.492
OH, GOD.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.662
>> THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.666
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHO VOTED FOR
JILLIAN.

04:58.699 --> 05:03.203
>> I SADLY VOTED TO EVICT
JILLIAN.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.706
>> I VOTE TO EVICT JILLIAN.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.274
>> I VOTE TO EVICT CHRISTMAS.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.276
>> I VOTE TO EVICT CHRISTMAS.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.011
>> I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.782
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THOSE FIVE
VOTES CAME FROM SOME OF THE

05:14.815 --> 05:15.883
GUYS.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.852
I'M A FAN OF THIS SHOW, AND I
KNOW THERE'S USUALLY AN

05:18.886 --> 05:22.723
ALL-GUYS' ALLIANCE THAT FORMS
REALLY EARLY ON, AND IT'S VERY

05:22.756 --> 05:24.692
CONCERNING TO SEE THAT.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.593
THAT MIGHT ALREADY BE HAPPENING.

05:25.626 --> 05:35.369
>> WE HAVE TO FOUND OUT THOSE
VOTES ASAP.

05:35.403 --> 05:38.038
>> IT'S AN INTERESTING HOUSE.

05:38.071 --> 05:41.475
>> BRO, I NEED TO GET IT
TOGETHER.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.812
>> IT'S LIKE YOU'VE GOT A WEEK
IN THE HOUSE SO TRY TO GET THOSE

05:44.845 --> 05:45.112
NERVES DOWN.

05:45.145 --> 05:45.913
>> YEAH.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.548
>> KNOW I'M HERE.

05:47.581 --> 05:48.916
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.418
YOUR FAMILY IS WATCHING.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.085
LIKE, ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING
THROUGH THE SAME THING.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.220
>> YEAH.

05:53.253 --> 05:56.223
>> JOSH IS A LITTLE WOUND UP
RIGHT NOW, AND I'M TRYING TO

05:56.256 --> 05:59.159
CALM HIM DOWN BECAUSE I LIKE THE
KID AND I WANT TO WORK WITH HIM,

05:59.192 --> 06:02.730
BUT THE PARANOIA OF THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE IS SETTING IN.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.732
YOU'VE GOT TO COUPLECOM DOWN.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.400
IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET HARDER
FROM HERE.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.769
>> I NEED TO SNAP OUT OF IT.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.071
TOMORROW I'LL BE FINE, SHAKE IT
OUT, I'LL BE GOOD.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.007
I THINK WE HAVE SOME TOUGH
PEOPLE IN HERE.

06:14.041 --> 06:14.908
>> YEAH.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.477
THAT EIGHT FOR JILLIAN.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.511
THAT WAS A SHOCKER.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.345
THAT'S PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.247
>> OPEN YOUR EYES.

06:20.280 --> 06:30.090
THE GIRLS AND RAMSESS ARE
FORMING.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.625
>> GOOD JOB, CODY.

06:31.659 --> 06:33.861
>> THANKS, MAN.

06:33.894 --> 06:39.767
>> I BET AN ALL-GUYS' ALLIANCE
IS FORMING.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.836
AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO
ABOUT IT.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.706
IF WE HAVE AN OPTION, GET ONE OF
THOSE STRONG GUYS OUT.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.176
>> YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO
STICK TOGETHER LIKE GLUE?

06:49.209 --> 06:56.684
>> YEAH.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.492
>> I LIKE OUR GROUP OF FOUR.

07:04.525 --> 07:05.125
I REALLY DO.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.193
>> ABSOLUTELY.

07:06.226 --> 07:10.297
>> LONG TERM, HAVING EIGHT
PEOPLE OR SUX PEOPLE NEVER

07:10.330 --> 07:11.532
WORKS.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.868
LIKE, SMALL GROUPS OF FOUR WORK
REALLY, REALLY WELL, USUALLY.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.737
WE CAN ADD PEOPLE IN AS WE NEED
THEM.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.807
>> ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO GUN FOR
H.O.H.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.811
>> WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE YET, BUT
THE H.O.H., OR HEAD OF

07:23.844 --> 07:28.916
HOUSEHOLD, IS THE PERSON IN THE
WHITE HOUSE WHO NOMINATES TWO

07:28.949 --> 07:30.017
HOUSEGUESTS FOR NOMINATION.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.887
>> I THINK I ALREADY KNOW WHO MY
NOMINATIONS WOULD BE.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.525
I'M FEELING MARK, I'M FEELING
PAUL, AND I'M FEELING CODY.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.828
IF ANY OF THOSE THREE GO, I AM
HAPPY.

07:40.861 --> 07:43.664
>> I DON'T TRUST PAUL.

07:43.697 --> 07:47.701
>> .

08:14.895 --> 08:24.638
>> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
THAT.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.875
>> IT'S OKAY.

08:27.908 --> 08:33.046
>> CHRISTMAS IS A VERY GENUINE
GOOD PERSON, AND I'M FEELING

08:33.080 --> 08:34.948
EXTREMELY WRONG FOR THAT VOTE
THEY GAVE HER.

08:34.982 --> 08:35.949
THIS IS MY THING.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.317
I'M JUST BEING MYSELF.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.720
>> YOU SHOULD.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.623
>> YEAH, SHE'S A GREAT
COMPETITOR, BUT I THINK I WAS

08:42.656 --> 08:43.824
TOO QUICK TO JUDGE.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.827
SHE HAS A BIGGER HEART, AND I
THINK THAT SHE'S SOMEBODY THAT

08:46.860 --> 08:49.329
KILLEEN ON BECAUSE IT'S
EXTREMELY HARD BEING WITHOUT MY

08:49.362 --> 08:50.263
FAMILY IN THIS HOUSE.

08:50.297 --> 08:52.499
I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE
ME LIKE THIS.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.068
>> NO, THIS IS LIKE AGGRESSIVE
SOCIAL CHESS.

08:55.102 --> 08:55.869
>> IT'S HARD.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.605
>> AND IT MESSES WITH YOUR
EMOTIONS.

08:57.638 --> 09:02.475
>> I'M A GENUINE PERSON AND
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO... ME UP

09:02.509 --> 09:02.976
IN THIS HOUSE.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.111
I HAVE A BIG HEART.

09:04.144 --> 09:08.415
>> THIS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE
OF THIS ENTIRE... GAME.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.418
JOSH IS ALREADY HAVING A HARD
TIME AND I'M TRYING TO BE THERE

09:11.451 --> 09:16.189
FOR HIM, GIVE HIM SOME WORDS OF
CHRISTMAS WISDOM, BUT THIS IS

09:16.223 --> 09:17.290
DAY TWO.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.593
AND IF HE KEEPS UP THIS
MENTALITY, IT'S GOING TO BE A

09:19.627 --> 09:20.594
REALLY LONG SUMMER.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.631
>> CAN I TELL YOU SOMETHING
BETWEEN ME AND YOU?

09:23.664 --> 09:24.932
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST.

09:24.965 --> 09:29.670
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
GRAVITATE TOWARDS YOU BECAUSE

09:29.703 --> 09:33.440
YOU'RE THE BAD-ASS WOMAN IN THE
HOUSE.

09:33.473 --> 09:35.175
>> WHAT'S YOUR FEEL ON MEGAN?

09:35.208 --> 09:40.681
>> I DON'T TRUST HER.

09:49.322 --> 09:54.061
>> I USED TO BE ON THE JERK
CREW.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.798
>> JERK!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.132
JERK!

09:59.166 --> 09:59.900
JERK!

10:14.447 --> 10:18.185
>> OH, MY GOSH, THE SUPER FAN IN
ME IS NERDING OUT RIGHT NOW.

10:18.218 --> 10:24.491
THIS IS NICOLE, THE SEASON 18
WINNER OF "BIG BROTHER."

10:24.524 --> 10:27.460
AND I AM JUST FAN BOYING.

10:27.494 --> 10:31.364
>> OH, MY GOD, NICOLE JUST
WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR AND

10:31.398 --> 10:34.802
SHE'S HERE, MY NUMBER ONE TOP
"BIG BROTHER" PERSON THAT I EVER

10:34.835 --> 10:36.303
WANTED TO MEET IS IN THE HOUSE.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.504
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER ABOUT IT.

10:37.537 --> 10:43.510
>> OH, MY GOD!

10:43.543 --> 10:45.512
>> SHE'S THE WINNER OF LAST
SEASON.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.613
>> WHAT'S HER NAME?

10:46.646 --> 10:54.955
>> NICOLE.

10:54.988 --> 10:59.059
>> LOOK, "BIG BROTHER," FIRST
YOU TOSS ME IN AS THE ONLY VET.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.696
THEN YOU GIVE ME A SHORT NUMBER
OF FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS. AND

11:02.730 --> 11:05.398
NOW YOU THROW NICOLE BACK IN THE
HOUSE.

11:05.432 --> 11:08.635
IT'S LIKE P.T.S.D.

11:08.668 --> 11:09.803
HOW ARE YOU, BABY GIRL?

11:09.837 --> 11:10.871
>> I LOVE YOU.

11:10.904 --> 11:14.808
WHAT'S UP, GUYS!

11:14.842 --> 11:16.844
IT'S CRAZY TO BE BACK IN THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.180
IT'S SO EXCITING THAT PAUL GETS
ANOTHER CHANCE!

11:20.213 --> 11:21.681
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.716
SO I'M ROOTING FOR HIM.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.753
I WANT TO MAKE SIGNS AND
T-SHIRTS.

ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY, LET'S
GATHER IN THE 11th ROOM!

11:28.021 --> 11:35.528
GUYS ON ONE SIDE, GIRLS ON THE
OTHER.

11:35.562 --> 11:38.565
I AM HERE TO HOST OF THE FIRST
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION OF

11:38.598 --> 11:39.499
THE SUMMER.

11:39.532 --> 11:44.905
LAST SUMMER, I WAS THE FIRST

11:44.938 --> 11:47.107
H.O.H. AND WENT ON TO WIN THE
WHOLE GAME.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.576
SORRY, PAUL.

11:49.609 --> 11:52.212
THE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD IS SAFE
FOR THE WEEK, AND WILL ENJOY THE

11:52.245 --> 11:54.882
PERKS AND PRIVILEGES OF THE HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD BEDROOM.

11:54.915 --> 11:58.118
BUT WITH THESE PERKS COME
RESPONSIBILITY OF NOMINATING TWO

11:58.151 --> 12:02.022
OF YOUR FELLOW HOUSEMATES FOR
EVICTION.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.925
IN THIS HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
COMPETITION, YOU WILL BE

12:04.958 --> 12:09.329
COMPETING IN TEAMS OF FOUR, TWO
MEN AND TWO WOMEN PER TEAM.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.765
A RANDOM DRAW WILL DETERMINE
TEAMS.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.134
>> I'M READY TO PLAY THE FIRST
H.O.H.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.204
BRING OUT MY INNER BEAST, SHOW
THESE PEOPLE WHAT THE RODEO

12:17.237 --> 12:18.671
CLOWN IS ALL ABOUT.

12:18.705 --> 12:22.109
SHOW THEM HOW WILD I CAN BE OUT
THERE, BUT YET HOW I CAN STICK

12:22.142 --> 12:24.177
THE WIN.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.114
>> I AM PUMPED!

12:27.147 --> 12:28.648
AND A LITTLE TERRIFIED.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.650
WE'VE ALREADY HAD AN EVICTION.

12:30.683 --> 12:32.786
PAUL IS OFFICIALLY A HOUSEGUEST.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.321
NICOLE JUST WALKED THROUGH THE
DOOR.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.622
THIS IS "BIG BROTHER"!

12:35.655 --> 12:37.124
I'M PLAYING "BIG BROTHER"!

12:37.157 --> 12:39.192
>> IT'S THE FIRST H.O.H.

12:39.226 --> 12:43.130
COMPETITION, AND THERE'S A TON
AT STAKE HERE BECAUSE YOUR BOY'S

12:43.163 --> 12:46.834
THE ONLY VET IN THE HOUSE, AND I
GOTTA PLAY MY CARDS RIGHT IF I

12:46.867 --> 12:49.870
WANT TO STAY IN THE HOUSE.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.851
WE'RE NUMBER ONE!

13:03.884 --> 13:05.418
>> SO WE WALK OUT INTO THE
BACKYARD.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.486
I'M IN THE JUNGLE.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.256
I HAVE MY ORANGE TEAM OF ALEX,
CHRISTMAS, AND RAMSES.

13:09.289 --> 13:16.129
ON THE YELLOW, ELENA, JILLIAN,
KEVIN AND JOSH.

13:16.163 --> 13:20.033
THEN THERE'S THE BLUE TEAM,
PAUL, MARK, RAVEN AND MEGAN.

13:20.067 --> 13:26.373
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE
PRETTY LILY PHILLY IN GOLD,

13:26.406 --> 13:27.140
NICOLE.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.675
I AM PUMPED FOR THIS COMP
TECTION.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.011
>> WELCOME BACK TO THE GARDEN OF
TEMPTATION.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.481
A CURSE HAS BEEN UNLEASHED AND
ROTTEN APPLES HAVE TAINTEDLY THE

13:34.514 --> 13:35.748
GARDEN.

13:35.782 --> 13:40.787
ON MY "GO," ONE PLAYER FROM EACH
TEAM WILL RACE ACROSS THE VINES

13:40.820 --> 13:42.890
IN THE GARDEN AND RETRIEVE A
ROTTEN APPLE.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.825
BRING IT BACK TO THE STARTING
PLATFORM AND HIT YOUR BUTTON SO

13:45.859 --> 13:47.727
THE NEXT PLAYER CAN GO.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.564
EACH TEAM MUST BRING BACK EIGHT
ROTTEN APPLES, TWO PER PERSON.

13:51.598 --> 13:55.969
ONCE A TEAM HAS RETRIEVED EIGHT
ROTTEN APPLES, THEY MUST HIT

13:56.003 --> 13:58.671
THEIR BUTTON TO ADVANCE TO THE
FINAL LEG OF THIS COMPETITION.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.475
ONLY THE FIRST TWO TEAMS TO
RETRIEVE EIGHT ROTTEN APPLES

14:02.509 --> 14:03.343
WILL ADVANCE.

14:03.376 --> 14:06.313
THE OTHER TWO TEAMS WILL BE
ELIMINATED.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.649
NOW, THIS IS A GARDEN OF
TEMPTATION AFTER ALL.

14:09.682 --> 14:14.521
IN THE GARDEN, YOU MAY COME
ACROSS A GOLDEN ALLE.

14:14.554 --> 14:18.158
SHOULD YOU BE THE FIRST TO PICK
A GOLDEN APPLE, RETURN IT TO THE

14:18.191 --> 14:21.661
STARTING PLATFORM AND HIT YOUR
BUTTON, YOU WILL BE SAFE FOR THE

14:21.694 --> 14:22.562
WEEK.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.931
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THE
FIRST ONE OUT.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.334
>> BUT EVERY TEMPTATION DOES
COME WITH A CONSEQUENCE.

14:27.367 --> 14:31.905
IF YOU EARN SAFETY FROM A GOLDEN
APPLE, YOUR TEAM WILL BE

14:31.939 --> 14:34.507
ELIMINATED FROM THE COMPETITION,
ENDING ALL OF THEIR CHANCES TO

14:34.541 --> 14:37.110
BE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD THIS WEEK.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.279
>> NO, WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

14:39.312 --> 14:47.587
>> WHO'S READY TO PLAY "HANGS IN
THE BALANCE?"

14:47.620 --> 14:49.056
>> IT'S THE FIRST H.O.H.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.191
THERE'S A LOT ON THE LINE HER.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.627
IT'S IN MY BEST INTEREST FOR MY
TEAM TO WIN.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.598
I HAVE TO MAKE SURE MY BUTT IS
COVERED, ESPECIALLY IN THIS

14:58.631 --> 14:59.366
FIRST WEEK COMING BACK.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.034
>> GO STRONG, GO STRONG.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.602
>> WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?

15:02.635 --> 15:07.140
>> I TOOK THE 25K IN THE FIRST
COMPETITION BUT I REALIZE IT

15:07.174 --> 15:11.244
CAME WITH A CONSEQUENCE AND NOW
I HAVE TO THROW THE H.O.H.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.746
THAT WOULD BE FINE IF I WAS
COMPETING BY MYSELF.

15:13.780 --> 15:17.317
BUT NOW I'M WITH A TEAM AND I
HAVE TO PUT MY TEAMMATES IN

15:17.350 --> 15:18.785
JEOPARDY, WHICH I'M NOT HAPPY
WITH.

15:18.818 --> 15:21.888
>> THIS H.O.H. COMPETITION IS
HUGE FOR ME AND MY TEAM.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.058
WE CAN GET THIS-- WE NEED TO GET
THIS-- BECAUSE BEING ON THE

15:25.092 --> 15:28.728
BLOCK TWICE IN ONE WEEK IS TO
THE SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO DO.

15:28.761 --> 15:36.136
>> ON YOUR MARK, GET SERKT GO!

15:36.169 --> 15:38.738
>> COME ON, CHRISTMAS!

15:38.771 --> 15:40.107
>> LET'S GO, PAUL!

15:40.140 --> 15:43.476
>> TO WIN THIS COMPETITION, EACH
TEAM MUST SEND ONE PLAYER AT A

15:43.510 --> 15:45.745
TIME TO SWING ACROSS THE JUNGLE
RIVER.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.614
>> YEAH, PAUL!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.349
GET IT, BABY!

15:49.382 --> 15:56.589
>> GRAB AN APEXPEL BRING IT BACK
WITHOUT DROPPING IT OR FALLING.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.926
ONCE ACROSS, YOU HAVE TO HIT THE
BUTTON BEFORE THE NEXT TEAMMATE

15:59.959 --> 16:01.194
CAN GO.

16:01.228 --> 16:05.598
THE FIRST TWO TEAMS TO GET EIGHT
APPLES SAFELY TO THEIR SIDE WILL

16:05.632 --> 16:07.867
MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PART OF THE
COMPETITION.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.269
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

16:09.302 --> 16:16.543
>> GO, GO, GO, GO!

16:16.576 --> 16:18.645
>> SO GOING INTO THIS H.O.H.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.514
COMPETITION, I DON'T FEEL TOO
GOOD ABOUT MY POSITION IN THIS

16:21.548 --> 16:23.183
HOUSE.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.653
I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT REALLY
BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY

16:26.686 --> 16:29.822
HOUSEGUESTS.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.058
>> YOU GOT IT!

16:31.091 --> 16:31.958
YOU GOT IT!

16:31.991 --> 16:33.893
>> WHERE'S THE GOLDEN APPLE?

16:33.926 --> 16:39.199
WHERE'S THE GOLDEN APPLE?

16:39.232 --> 16:43.536
SO I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GRAB
THIS GOLDEN APPLE AND I NEED TO

16:43.570 --> 16:44.471
ENSURE MY SAFETY THIS WEEK.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.406
>> OH, HE'S DOING IT!

16:46.439 --> 16:49.309
>> THAT'S WHY HE WAS SO ADAMANT
ON GOING FIRST.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.510
>> HE TOOK THE GOLD.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.480
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, BRO!

16:53.513 --> 16:55.648
YOU JUST SCREWED ME OVER.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.151
I HAVE NO SHOT AT SAFETY, NO
SHOT AT H.O.H.

16:58.185 --> 17:08.661
I COULD BE ON THE BLOCK THIS
WEEK BECAUSE OF YOU.

17:08.695 --> 17:16.336
>> I'M SORRY, YELLOW TEAM YOU
HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE

17:16.369 --> 17:16.936
COMPETITION.

17:16.969 --> 17:17.504
>> WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.838
>> HE GOT THE GOLD.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.341
>> YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS
GUNNING FOR ME?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.242
>> WHAT?

17:22.275 --> 17:23.042
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:23.076 --> 17:27.214
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ARE GUNNING FOR
ME.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.350
>> THIS MOVE FROM JOSH IS SO
SELFISH, HE LITERALLY MADE

17:30.383 --> 17:31.551
EVERYONE HATE HIM.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.453
>> I AIN'T GOING NOWHERE!

17:33.486 --> 17:36.189
I HAD A GUT FEELING ALL DAY.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.291
BABY, I PICK UP ON VIBES.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.226
I PICK UP ON VIBES.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.793
>> YOU'RE SAFE WE'RE NOT.

17:40.827 --> 17:45.298
>> I DON'T THINK HE WAS ON
ANYONE'S RADAR, BUT NOW HE IS.

17:45.332 --> 17:48.235
>> I COULDN'T EVEN SEE WHAT WAS
HAPPENING.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.369
>> BLUE TEAM WITH THREE APPLES.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.473
>> SO MY ADRENALINE IS PUMPING,
FIRST H.O.H.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.542
>> OH, MY GOD, HE'S SO BIG.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.610
>> AND, BAM!

17:57.644 --> 17:58.911
DISLOCATED FINGER.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.547
>> HOLY CRAP!

18:00.580 --> 18:05.418
>> MY FINGER LOOKS LIKE IT JUST
SPLIT INTO TWO, BUT ALL I KNOW

18:05.452 --> 18:07.220
IS I HAVE TO KEEP COMPETING.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.721
I NEED THIS H.O.H.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.657
>> BOY, YOU HAVE TO GO FAST NOW.

18:10.690 --> 18:14.227
HIT THE BUTTON, HIT THE BUTTON,
HIT THE BUTTON.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.995
>> PINK TEAM WITH A THIRD APPLE.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.965
>> WE WERE KIND OF NECK AND NECK
BUT A LITTLE BIT FALLING BEHIND

18:18.998 --> 18:23.570
SO I KNEW MY PORTION HAD TO BE
FASTER IF WE WERE GOING TO BEAT

18:23.603 --> 18:31.678
THE OTHER TEAMS.

18:35.114 --> 18:43.089
>> GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

18:43.122 --> 18:48.094
>> ORANGE TEAM WITH THEIR FIFTH
APPLE.

18:48.127 --> 18:52.199
>> THIS IS LITERALLY THE WORST
COMPETITION FOR ME.

18:52.232 --> 18:56.002
I'M NO SCIENTIST, BUT LONG VINES
AND SHORT LEGS ARE NOT A GREAT

18:56.035 --> 18:59.772
COMBINATION.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.342
>> YOU THINK I WOULD BE GOOD AT
THIS.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.776
I'M A DANCER.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.180
I'M USED TO KICKING MY LEGS.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.349
I'VE DONE SILK SO PRETTY.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.517
THIS AIN'T PRETTY.

19:10.550 --> 19:14.086
I LOOK LIKE A HOT MESS.

19:14.120 --> 19:20.927
>> PINK TEAM WITH SIX APPLES.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.700
>> BUT AS I'M SWINGING THROUGH
THESE VINES, I THINK TO MYSELF,

19:27.734 --> 19:30.537
DOMINIQUE, YOU SHOULD HAVE SPENT
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME IN THE

19:30.570 --> 19:33.039
GYM BEFORE YOU CAME TO THE B.B.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.207
HOUSE.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.376
>> HIT THAT BUTTON!

19:36.409 --> 19:42.048
GO!

19:42.081 --> 19:46.052
>> WE HAVE ONE APPLE LEFT IN
THIS COMPETITION, SO CODY NEEDS

19:46.085 --> 19:50.457
TO BOOK IT ACROSS THIS FIELD AND
GET BACK SO WE CAN ADVANCE TO

19:50.490 --> 19:51.224
THE NEXT ROUND.

19:51.258 --> 20:01.501
>> CODY'S LOOKING SOLID.

20:01.534 --> 20:06.506
>> WATCH OUT, LOSER.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.676
>> PINK TEAM IS THE FIRST TO
FINISH FINISH.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.777
CONGRATULATIONS, PINK TEAM!

20:10.810 --> 20:15.181
YOU GUYS WILL BE ADVANCING TO
THE NEXT STAGE.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.183
IT'S DOWN TO ORANGE VERSUS BLUE.

20:17.216 --> 20:20.620
WHO WILL JOIN THE PINK TEAM TO
BATTLE IT OUT FOR H.O.H.?

20:20.653 --> 20:24.457
>> IT LOOKS LIKE MY FINGER'S
DANGLING BY A THREAD TO STAY ON

20:24.491 --> 20:27.860
TO MY HAND, BUT I KNOW WE NEED
THIS FINAL APTOLL ADVANCE TO THE

20:27.894 --> 20:28.728
NEXT ROUND.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.198
THIS IS THE FIRST H.O.H., AND I
WANT IT.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.402
>> I'M NOT, LIKE, REALLY AN
ATHLETE, AND I'M NOT USED TO

20:35.435 --> 20:38.805
HEARING, LIKE, "GO, RAMSES!

20:38.838 --> 20:39.872
GRAMSES!"
WHICH IS AWESOME, BUT THE

20:39.906 --> 20:42.542
PRESSURE IS GETTING TO ME.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.311
>> COME ON, RAMSES!

20:44.344 --> 20:45.412
YOU'RE A BEAST!

20:45.445 --> 20:48.214
BEAST!

20:48.247 --> 20:48.981
>> RAMSES!

20:49.015 --> 20:50.783
OH, MY GOD!

20:50.817 --> 20:52.552
>> HIT THE BUTOP.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.053
YOU'RE A BEAST!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.822
YOU'RE A... BEAST.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.290
>> CONGRATULATIONS TEAM BLUE.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.792
YOU GUYS WILL BE ADVANCING TO
THE NEXT STAGE.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.429
>> THIS IS WHAT IT TOOK TO MOVE
ON TO THE NEXT ROUND.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.230
, BUT HEY, IT WAS WORTH IT.

21:04.263 --> 21:07.467
NOW IT'S TIME TO PLAY FOR THAT
H.O.H.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.903
>> NOT ONLY DID I LET MY TEAM
DOWN, BUT I FEEL LIKE THIS IS

21:10.937 --> 21:16.108
SUCH A BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT I
JUST LOST TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT I

21:16.142 --> 21:22.248
AM A STRONG COMPETITOR AND THAT
I CAN WIN CHALLENGES.

21:22.281 --> 21:25.852
>> WHO GOT THE GOLDEN APPLE.

21:25.885 --> 21:26.185
>> JOSH.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.086
>> WHO?

21:27.119 --> 21:27.854
>> JOSH.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.989
>> SEE WHAT JOSH DID TO HIS
TEAM?

21:30.022 --> 21:33.159
HE TOOK THE GOLDEN APPLE RIGHT
AWAY.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.093
>> HOLY CRAP!

21:34.126 --> 21:34.794
HE REALLY DID?

21:34.827 --> 21:38.030
>> AND HE THINKS HE'S SAFE NOW.

21:38.064 --> 21:41.968
Y I DON'T LIKE WHEN SOMEBODY
DOES SOMETHING SELFISH.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.437
IF YOU MAKE YOURSELF SELFISH AT
THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME

21:44.471 --> 21:45.838
EVERYBODY WILL TARGET YOU.

21:45.872 --> 21:51.043
JOSH IS A COWARD IN MY BOOK AND
I WILL TARGET HIM IN THE FUTURE.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.513
>> I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING
CLEAR.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.515
I'M AN INTELLIGENT GUY, AND I'M
A SMART GUY.

21:55.548 --> 21:59.118
>> AND GOT A BRAIN, AND I DON'T
WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU IN

21:59.151 --> 22:00.353
THIS GAME.

22:00.387 --> 22:02.455
I LOVE EVERYBODY BUT YOU, AND I
WANTED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR,

22:02.489 --> 22:05.958
I'M NOT H.O.H., BUT I'M TELLING
YOU YOU'RE A SNAKE.

22:05.992 --> 22:06.993
YOU CAN TALK WHEN I'M DONE.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.260
YOU'RE A SNAKE.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.464
EVERYBODY HAS A GOOD HEART HERE,
AND YOU'RE A SNAKE AND A BULLY,

22:11.498 --> 22:12.298
AND I'M DONE WITH YOU.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.134
>> I AM SO CONFUSED.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.002
AND I'M HURT.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.038
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID TO THIS
GUY.

22:19.071 --> 22:23.175
>> I AM ABOUT TO RIP SOMEBODY'S
HEAD OFF.

22:23.209 --> 22:24.210
I NEED SOME AIR.

22:24.243 --> 22:27.647
>> JOSH IS DIGGING HIMSELF A
GIANT GRAVE RIGHT NOW.

22:27.680 --> 22:32.318
NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE THE GOLDEN
APPLE SELFISHLY, BUT HE'S

22:32.351 --> 22:39.392
STIRRING UP A BIG POT OF CRAZY
AND EVERYBODY IS WATCHING.

22:39.426 --> 22:42.395
>> CONGRATULATIONS, BLUE TEAM
AND PINK TEAM.

22:42.429 --> 22:46.999
YOU HAVE BOTH ADVANCED TO THE
FINAL LEG OF THE H.O.H.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.034
COMPETITION.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.069
HERE'S HOW THIS LEG WORKS.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.773
YOU MUST BALANCE THE SEVEN GOOD
APPLES ON THE BRANCHES OF THE

22:53.806 --> 22:56.509
PUZZLE TREE, RACE BACK THROUGH
THE VINES, AND HIT YOUR BUTTON

22:56.543 --> 22:59.178
WITH ALL OF YOUR APPLES
REMAINING ON THE TREE.

22:59.211 --> 23:04.183
BUT HERE'S THE CATCH-- EACH TEAM
MUST CHOOSE ONE AND ONLY ONE

23:04.216 --> 23:06.218
OTHER TEAMMATE'S TO COMPETE IN
THIS FINAL LEG.

23:06.252 --> 23:07.954
>> OH, MY GOD!

23:07.987 --> 23:11.023
>> EVERYONE ELSE ON YOUR TEAM
WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BE

23:11.057 --> 23:13.693
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.127
MAKE YOUR CHOICE WISELY.

23:15.161 --> 23:19.031
BECAUSE THE WINNER WILL BE THE
FIRST H.O.H. OF THE SUMMER.

23:19.065 --> 23:21.033
>> YOU WANT IT?

23:21.067 --> 23:21.668
>> YEAH.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.902
>> I WANT TO WIN THIS H.O.H.

23:22.935 --> 23:26.906
BECAUSE I'M NOT AFRAID TO SPILL
FIRST BLOOD, AND I HAVE A GAME

23:26.939 --> 23:28.207
PLAN I'M READY TO EXECUTE.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.477
>> DO ANY OF YOU WANT TO DO IT?

23:30.510 --> 23:31.177
>> NO.

23:31.210 --> 23:34.481
>> MIKE HAS A DISLOCATED FINGER.

23:34.514 --> 23:39.285
MEGAN IS SHAKEN UP BECAUSE OF
JOSH, AND I'M THINKING I'M THE

23:39.318 --> 23:40.987
ONLY VIABLE OPTION HERE.

23:41.020 --> 23:41.954
>> GOOD LUCK.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.222
>> SAFE NO MATTER WHAT?

23:43.255 --> 23:46.993
>> PLUS I HAVE TO ENSURE MY
SAFETY THIS WEEK AND I SURE

23:47.026 --> 23:49.295
AIN'T COUNTING ON THEM SO HERE
GOES NOTHING.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.799
>> ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!

23:52.832 --> 23:56.836
>> IN ROUND TWO OF THIS H.O.H.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.138
COMPETITION, WE HAVE TO BALANCE
THESE SEVEN APPLES ON THE

23:59.171 --> 24:01.741
BRANCHES OF THIS TREE.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.976
>> THOSE ARE LIGHTER, AREN'T
THEY?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.177
THE GREEN ARE LIGHTER?

24:05.211 --> 24:08.848
>> THE FIRST THING I NOTICE
ABOUT THESE GIANT APPLES IS THAT

24:08.881 --> 24:10.583
THEY ALL WEIGH VERY DIFFERENT
WEIGHTS.

24:10.617 --> 24:11.818
>> COME ON, PAUL.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.920
>> SO THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO
BE PRETTY DIFFICULT TO GET THESE

24:13.953 --> 24:15.922
THINGS TO DO A BALANCING ACT.

24:15.955 --> 24:19.025
>> YOU GOT IT, CODY.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.927
>> SO I GET UP TO THE TREE.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.263
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GOING TO
BE THE BRANCHES, BUT, LITERAL

24:24.296 --> 24:27.333
LEASH THE ENTIRE TREE STARTS
MOVING.

24:27.366 --> 24:31.604
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIGGER
CHALLENGE THAN I INITIALLY

24:31.638 --> 24:32.138
THOUGHT.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.139
>> MY TREE IS PISSED.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.340
>> YOUR TREE IS ANGRY.

24:34.373 --> 24:35.775
>> YOU GOT IT, CODY.

24:35.808 --> 24:40.046
>> GO, CODY!

24:40.079 --> 24:46.686
>> YOU GOT IT, CODY.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.054
>> TAKE YOUR TIME, CODY.

24:48.087 --> 24:52.458
>> TAKE YOUR TIME, PAUL.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.527
>> COME ON, GUYS!

24:54.561 --> 24:55.695
>> YOU GOT IT!

24:55.728 --> 24:57.196
>> YOU GOT IT!

24:57.229 --> 24:59.131
YOU GOT IT!

24:59.165 --> 25:00.332
>> NICE AND EASY!

25:00.366 --> 25:03.803
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN
INCREDIBLE FOCUS SO I CAN JUST

25:03.836 --> 25:06.906
GET THESE THINGS BALANCED AS
QUICK AS POSSIBLE AND TAKE THIS

25:06.939 --> 25:07.406
COMPETITION.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.575
>> YOU GOT IT, PAL!

25:08.608 --> 25:09.842
>> YOU GOT THIS!

25:09.876 --> 25:16.148
AR>> COME ON, PLAY FOR AMERICA!

25:16.182 --> 25:16.816
FOR AMERICA!

25:16.849 --> 25:18.217
>> TAKE YOUR TIME, PAUL.

25:18.250 --> 25:22.054
>> THAT'S IT CODY, COME FROM
THAT END.

25:22.088 --> 25:26.158
I WANT TO YOU PUT IT UP A LEVEL.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.728
>> YOU SON OF A BITCH.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.497
THIS TREE IS PISSED AND MOVING
IN ALL SORTS OF DIRECTION.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.667
LISTEN, TREES, I'M TRYING TO
HOOK YOU UP WITH SOME APPLES BUT

25:34.701 --> 25:39.706
IF YOU KEEP MOVING AROUND OTHER
NEITHER OF US IS GOING TO BE

25:39.739 --> 25:39.972
HAPPY.

25:40.006 --> 25:44.343
>> GO!

25:44.376 --> 25:46.045
>> DON'T GIVE UP, PAUL.

25:46.078 --> 25:46.613
DON'T GIVE UP.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.715
>> DO NOT GIVE UP!

25:48.748 --> 25:50.583
>> TAKE YOUR TIME!

25:50.617 --> 25:51.684
TAKE YOUR TIME!

25:51.718 --> 25:54.687
YOU GOT IT, YOU GOT IT!

25:54.721 --> 26:02.028
>> THE WINNER OF THE FIRST

26:02.061 --> 26:03.429
H.O.H. IS CODY!

26:03.462 --> 26:08.034
>> IT WAS EXTREMELY COOL TO GET

26:08.067 --> 26:08.835
THIS VICTORY.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.569
I'M THE FIRST H.O.H. OF THE
SEASON.

26:10.603 --> 26:13.640
NOW I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE A
DECISION ON WHO TO PUT UP.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.541
>> M.V.P.!

26:15.574 --> 26:19.111
>> CODY, HE WASN'T FIRST
COMPETITION, AND NOW HE WON THE

26:19.145 --> 26:22.615
FIRST H.O.H., AND AT THIS POINT,
I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND

26:22.649 --> 26:26.653
OF TERROR HE IS ABOUT TO INFLICT
ON THIS HOUSE.

26:38.564 --> 26:44.070
>> GOOD JOB!

26:44.103 --> 26:48.340
>> FIRST H.O.H., BABY!

26:48.374 --> 26:49.541
FIRST H.O.H.

26:49.575 --> 26:53.279
>> NOW THAT I'M H.O.H., TIME TO
DRAW SOME LINES IN THE SAND.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.014
I WANT TO BE THE ONE THAT
DIVIDES THE HOUSE.

26:55.047 --> 26:58.517
I WANT TO SEE WHO MY FRIENDS ARE
AND WHO MY ENEMIES ARE, AND IT

26:58.550 --> 26:59.852
STARTS TODAY.

26:59.886 --> 27:03.589
>> RIGHT BEFORE WE STARTED THIS
COMPETITION, I SHOOK CODY'S HAND

27:03.622 --> 27:06.693
AND SAID, "HEY, NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, WE'RE SAFE, RIGHT?"

27:06.726 --> 27:10.196
AND HE NOLDED HIS HEAD AND SHOOK
MY HAND.

27:10.229 --> 27:11.530
GENTLEMAN'S HANDSHAKE.

27:11.563 --> 27:16.135
SO NOW MY PLAN IS TO JUST LAY
LOW, NOT ASK HIM ABOUT TNOT TALK

27:16.168 --> 27:18.838
TO HIM ABOUT IT, BECAUSE WE MADE
THE AGREEMENT AND IF I TRUFLT

27:18.871 --> 27:24.176
YOU AND YOU TRUST ME, WE DON'T
NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.513
>> I ALREADY CALLED OUT MEGAN
DURING THE COMPETITION, BUT I

27:27.546 --> 27:30.950
FEEL LIKE I NEED TO CLEAR THE
AIR AND CALL HER OUT IN FRONT OF

27:30.983 --> 27:33.452
THE EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE SO
I'M GOING TO DO IT RIGHT NOW.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.323
YOU KNOW WHAT, MEGAN, I'M GOING
TO TALK TO YOU AND DO IT IN

27:37.356 --> 27:38.424
PACKAGE.

27:38.457 --> 27:39.826
I THINK THE WAY YOU'RE PLAYING
THE GAME IS DISGUSTING.

27:39.859 --> 27:42.962
I LIKE YOU AS A PERSON BUT STOP
WITH THE MESSING YOU'RE DOING,

27:42.995 --> 27:44.731
WITH ALL THE ?IED REMARKS.

27:44.764 --> 27:49.568
>> I SWEAR THEY AM NOT TRYING TO
MESS WITH YOUR HEAD AT ALL AND I

27:49.601 --> 27:51.838
APOLOGIZE--
>> EVERYBODY WILL SEE IT.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.406
THEY'LL SEE IT GEE, I PROMISE,
IF YOU POINT IT OUT TO ME AND

27:54.440 --> 27:56.776
YOU THINK I'M DOING SOMETHING, I
WILL IMMEDIATELY STOP.

27:56.809 --> 28:00.246
>> LISTEN, IF I DIDN'T WIN
SAFETY TODAY I WAS GOING HOME

28:00.279 --> 28:02.081
BECAUSE YOU WERE GOING TO RALLY
AGAINST ME.

28:02.114 --> 28:05.484
>> NO, IF SOMEONE TOLD YOU I WAS
GOING TO REALLY AGAINST YOU--

28:05.517 --> 28:06.753
>> NOBODY TOLD ME ANYTHING.

28:06.786 --> 28:07.887
I HAVE COMMON SENSE.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.989
I GENUINELY LIKE EVERYBODY IN
THIS HOUSE.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.491
>> EVIDENCE NOT GUNNING FOR YOU
AT ALL.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.526
I'M NOT GUNNING FOR ANYONE.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.428
>> BE A HUMAN BEING.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.231
WHEN SOMEBODY IS DOWN, YOU DON'T
ATTACK THEM, EVERYBODY KNOWS

28:19.265 --> 28:19.932
THAT.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.067
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN ATTACKING YOU.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.836
>> OKAY, THIS IS WHY I DID IT IN
PUBLIC--

28:23.870 --> 28:25.872
>> I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK WE
NEED TO WALK AWAY.

28:25.905 --> 28:29.008
>> THIS IS WHY I DID IT PUBLIC
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND

28:29.041 --> 28:32.912
POP IN ON EVERY CONVERSATION SO
THAT PEOPLE DON'T COMPARE NOTES.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.047
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.683
GO POP IN THE CONVERSATION--
>> I'LL TELL YOU THAT I'M SORRY

28:37.716 --> 28:38.851
AND I WANT TO LEAVE IT THERE.

28:38.885 --> 28:42.789
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, AND
GENUINELY, I THINK YOU'RE A

28:42.822 --> 28:43.422
REALLY NICE GIRL.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.456
I THINK YOU'RE A NICE GIRL.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.524
AND YOU KNOW BETTER.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.460
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT WENT
AFTER THE GOLDEN APPLE.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.296
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SCREWED OVER
YOUR TEAM.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.164
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT ATTACKED ME.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.465
YOU'RE THE JERK HERE.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.067
NOT ME.

28:55.101 --> 28:58.670
YOU'RE SAFE THIS WEEK, AND I
JUST LEFT OUT HERE IN THE COLD.

28:58.704 --> 29:03.976
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH
THIS GIANT TARGET YOU PUT ON MY

29:04.010 --> 29:04.410
BACK?

29:04.443 --> 29:09.615
>> LISTEN TO ME.

29:10.749 --> 29:17.556
>> YEAH, FOR SURE.

29:17.589 --> 29:23.429
>> IF YOU GO... CRAZY AND START
YELLING LIKE... WHAT'S HE

29:23.462 --> 29:24.263
YELLING ABOUT MAN.

29:24.296 --> 29:25.431
JOSH IS JUST DIFFERENT.

29:25.464 --> 29:29.301
HE'S A MOMMA'S GUY, AND IT'S
HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HIS

29:29.335 --> 29:30.502
MINDSET, 100%.

29:30.536 --> 29:34.173
WHEN I GO HOME I'M NEVER GOING
TO YELL AT MY KIDS EVER AGAIN,

29:34.206 --> 29:35.107
EVER.

29:35.141 --> 29:36.909
THE KIDS IN HERE SOMETIMES
THEY'RE JUST NUTS.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.344
DID YOU COME FROM A BIG FAMILY.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.312
>> DID I SAY REALLY BAD WORDS.

29:40.346 --> 29:44.550
>> JUST THE INTIMIDATED LOOK IN
YOUR EYE SCARED...

29:44.583 --> 29:46.285
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN
AGAIN.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.053
>> I KNOW.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.055
>> I WILL CHILL FOR THE REST
WEEK.

29:49.088 --> 29:51.690
>> LET'S SAY ONE THING, IT'S
BEEN EVENTFUL.

29:51.723 --> 29:53.860
>> IT'S WITHIN AN EMOTIONAL
NIGHT.

29:53.893 --> 29:58.264
NOW I NEED TO FIND A WAY TO TRY
TO MOVE FORWARD AND TRY TO LAY

29:58.297 --> 30:02.234
LOW.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.539
>> THEY'RE EVEN YOUR COLOR.

30:07.573 --> 30:10.576
>> THAT IS AMAZING!

30:10.609 --> 30:12.378
WAIT SO WHAT IS THIS FOR, SHOW?

30:12.411 --> 30:16.415
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO?

30:16.448 --> 30:18.784
>> I WASN'T GOING TO BREAK THIS
OUT SO FAST.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.420
>> THINGS ARE A LITTLE TENSE
AFTER THIS H.O.H. COMP.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.054
CODY WON.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.956
JOSH IS FIGHTING WITH MEG.

30:23.990 --> 30:27.626
TENSIONS ARE RIDING HIGH, AND IF
THERE'S ONE THING YOUR BOY IS

30:27.659 --> 30:31.964
GOOD AT, IT'S BEING THE BREATH
OF FRESH AIR.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.100
LOOK, I MAY NOT HAVE WON H.O.H.

30:34.133 --> 30:40.606
BUT I'M GOING TO RIDE A BULL,
BRO!

30:40.639 --> 30:43.309
>> OOOOOOW!

30:43.342 --> 30:45.244
>> LOOK AT ME.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.778
I'M THE VET WHO CAME BACK.

30:46.812 --> 30:49.348
I LOST THE H.O.H., AND I'VE GOT
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

30:49.381 --> 30:59.225
OTHER THAN THE RASH I'M GOING TO
GET THESE FROM ASS-LESS CHAPS.

30:59.258 --> 31:02.594
>> YEE-HAW!

31:02.628 --> 31:06.132
>> PAUL THINKS HE CAN GET OUT OF
ANY SITUATION WITH HIS SOCIAL

31:06.165 --> 31:06.465
GAME.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.333
HE'S LOUD.

31:07.366 --> 31:08.767
HE TRIES TO GET ON EVERYBODY'S
GOOD SIDE.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.536
BUT I SEE RIGHT THROUGH THIS
GUY.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.971
I SEE HIM AS A THREAT.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.372
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A THREAT?

31:13.405 --> 31:23.449
YOU TAKE HIM OUT.

31:23.449 --> 31:28.587
YOU TAKE HIM OUT.

31:35.161 --> 31:39.966
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS ASSUMING.

31:39.999 --> 31:45.471
>> OH, YEAH.

31:53.279 --> 31:56.448
>> THIS IS YOUR H.O.H.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.017
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL
COMFORTABLE WITH.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.486
>> I LOOK AT THE CONVERSATIONS
WITH YOU AND MATT THE SAME WAY.

32:00.519 --> 32:01.053
>> GOOD.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.154
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

32:02.188 --> 32:03.889
YOU AND MATT ALL THE WAY TO THE
END.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.193
>> MYSELF, MARK, AND MATT, WE
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT AN ALLIANCE

32:07.226 --> 32:10.596
OR REQUESTING LIKE THAT, BUT I
FEEL LIKE WE'VE BEEN ON THE SAME

32:10.629 --> 32:11.230
PAGE SINCE DAY ONE.

32:11.263 --> 32:13.765
>> ME, YOU, AND MATT.

32:13.799 --> 32:14.333
I LOVE MATT.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.167
>> YEAH.

32:15.201 --> 32:18.004
>> I WANTED THIS, LIKE, WITH US
THREE.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.573
BUT, I MEAN, YOU'RE LIKE--
YOU'RE QUIET.

32:21.607 --> 32:24.276
SO I DIDN'T EYE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
YOU FELT ABOUT ME.

32:24.310 --> 32:26.778
I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS
CONVERSATION.

32:26.812 --> 32:29.581
LIKE, US THREE, LIKE, DUDE.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.682
CODY'S H.O.H.

32:30.716 --> 32:33.552
HE'S COMING TO ME TALKING ABOUT
AN ALLIANCE WITH MATT.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.688
THIS IS THE EXACT SITUATION I
WANT TO BE IN RIGHT NOW.

32:36.722 --> 32:39.858
DUDE, IT'S GOING TO BE A
BEAUTIFUL THING.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.529
I'M EXCITED, BRO.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.431
THE THREE OF US, WE ALL CAN
COMPETE.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.832
WE ALL HAVE A GREAT SOCIAL GAME.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.867
WE HAVE EVERYTHING.

33:37.716 --> 33:42.354
>> I GENUINELY FEEL EXTREMELY
BAD FOR THAT EXPLOSIVE ARGUMENT

33:42.388 --> 33:43.589
THEY HAD.

33:43.622 --> 33:47.393
I ISOLATED MYSELF PRETTY QUICKLY
IN THE GAME, AND I MADE A HUGE

33:47.426 --> 33:50.929
TARGET OUT OF MYSELF, AND IT'S
EXTREMELY UNACCEPTABLE.

33:50.962 --> 33:57.236
I JUST WANTED TO SAY, LIKE, I
FEEL LIKE... FOR THE WAY THAT I

33:57.269 --> 33:57.836
REACTED.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.504
THAT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.307
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOT INTO ME.

34:01.340 --> 34:08.614
I THINK IT WAS MY ADRE ADRENALIN
>> EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH.

34:08.647 --> 34:13.119
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M
AWAY FROM MY FAMILY, COMPLETELY

34:13.152 --> 34:15.221
DISCONNECTED AND I'M HAVING A
HARD TIME WITH THAT.

34:15.254 --> 34:20.792
BUT THE WAY I SCREAMED AT YOU,
NOBODY SHOULD DO THAT.

34:20.826 --> 34:21.460
AND I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.529
>> I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR JOSH.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.564
I THINK HE KNOWS HOW MUCH HE
SCREWED UP.

34:25.597 --> 34:28.467
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE'S
SAFE THIS WEEK, AND I'M NOT.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.404
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE
OUT SOME WAY TO FIX THE MESS HE

34:32.438 --> 34:33.472
CREATED.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.673
>> AND I JUST WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR HOW I REACTED--

34:34.706 --> 34:38.144
>> WELL, I HOPE YOU KNOW, I
FORGIVE YOU, BUT I WON'T FORGET.

34:38.177 --> 34:41.447
>> I KNOW, AND I COMPLETELY
RESPECT THAT.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.315
CAN I GIVE YOU A HUG IF YOU
DON'T MIND.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.784
>>
>> OH, YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

34:45.817 --> 34:50.956
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

34:50.989 --> 34:51.657
>> WHAT UP?

34:51.690 --> 34:53.859
>> I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH BASE.

34:53.892 --> 34:55.327
I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED WITH
YOU.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.529
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GO UP ON
THE BLOCK.

34:57.563 --> 35:01.133
YOU KNOW, THE STANDARD.

35:01.167 --> 35:04.836
, I'LL VOTE WITH YOU, OR WHOEVER
YOUR TARGET IS.

35:04.870 --> 35:10.242
YOU KNOW.

35:10.276 --> 35:15.347
CODY IS H.O.H., AND I HAVE ZERO
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

35:15.381 --> 35:19.818
THIS GUY IS STONE COLD WITH HIS
REACTIONS WITH ME.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.687
I DON'T WANT TO GO ON THE BLOCK
THE FIRST WEEK.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.255
IF YOU DO, I GET IT.

35:23.289 --> 35:23.889
I UNDERSTAND.

35:23.922 --> 35:25.524
FIGHT FOR MY LIFE.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.726
GO FOR THAT VETO.

35:27.759 --> 35:32.731
>> SO MEGAN COMES UP TO ME WITH
HER "BIG BROTHER" CLICHEED "SAVE

35:32.764 --> 35:36.602
ME" SPEECH, AND IF THERE'S ONE
THING I DON'T RESPECT, IT'S

35:36.635 --> 35:38.404
BEGGING AND SELFISHNESS.

35:38.437 --> 35:47.213
IF SHE THINKS SHE'S GOING TO GET
ANY INTELEFRO TELE FROM ME, SHE'

35:47.246 --> 35:48.079
WRONG.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.315
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR HEAD
IS AT--

35:49.348 --> 35:51.317
>> I'M NOT TELLING ANYBODY.

35:51.350 --> 35:53.919
>> I KNOW YOU'RE KEEPING TIGHT
LIPPED.

35:53.952 --> 35:55.887
I AM AN INTERROGATOR.

35:55.921 --> 35:59.057
I WORKED IN A PRISON, BUT HE'S
GIVING ME NOTHING!

35:59.090 --> 36:00.226
ALL RIGHT, HAVE FUN.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.527
THANK YOU FOR TALKING WITH ME.

36:01.560 --> 36:16.408
I DO APPRECIATE IT.

36:16.442 --> 36:21.747
>> I KNOW I CAN'T GO FAR IN THIS
GAME WITHOUT SOME KIND OF A

36:21.780 --> 36:23.014
TEAM.

36:23.048 --> 36:24.250
INDIVIDUALLY, IT JUST DOESN'T
WORK.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.653
UNIT COHESION IS IMPORTANT WHEN
YOU PUT A BUNCH OF LIKE-MINDED

36:27.686 --> 36:31.022
PEOPLE TOGETHER, SO WHAT I'M
TRYING TO DO IS FIND PEOPLE

36:31.056 --> 36:33.625
SIMILAR TO ME, SIMILAR IN THE
SENSE THAT THEY ARE LEVEL HEADED

36:33.659 --> 36:37.763
AND THEY WON'T CRACK UNDER ANY
KIND OF EMOTIONAL PRESSURE.

36:37.796 --> 36:43.068
MATT AND MARK, I JUST FEEL LIKE

36:43.101 --> 36:45.103
THERE'S JUST A NATURAL
CONNECTION WITH EACH OF THEM.

36:45.136 --> 36:47.072
>> THAT'S A CUTE BATHING SUIT.

36:47.105 --> 36:51.610
>> THE SECOND CORE OF THE TEAM
THAT I'M TRYING TO FORM IS THE

36:51.643 --> 36:52.778
BAIBZ.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.880
CHRISTMAS, DOMINIQUE, RAVEN, AND
ELENA.

36:54.913 --> 36:55.881
THEY ARE SMART.

36:55.914 --> 36:58.083
THEY KNOW HOW TO WORK THE GAME.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.386
AND THEN JESSICA.

37:00.419 --> 37:08.059
I MEAN, CLEARLY, JESSICA IS... I
DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO SAY IT.

37:08.093 --> 37:13.999
SHE IS DISTRACTING MY GAME.

37:14.032 --> 37:17.903
AND THEN THERE'S THIS GROUP THAT
I CONSIDER THE OUTSIDERS--

37:17.936 --> 37:21.973
MEGAN, ALEX, JASON, RAMSES,
JILLIAN, KEVIN, PAUL.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.075
THERE IS NO TOUGH CIEWLZ.

37:24.109 --> 37:28.980
NOW I'VE JUST GOT TO MAKE A
DECISION ON WHO TO PUT UP.

37:29.014 --> 37:39.458
I NEED TO CHUCK SOME WATER.

37:48.534 --> 37:51.269
>> CRAZY DAY.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.606
>> BASICALLY I WANT TO RUN IT BY
YOU, YOU AND MATT.

37:54.640 --> 37:58.444
SO THERE'S THE THREE OUTSIDE
CHICKS, YOU KNOW.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.077
ALEX.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.278
>> SHE'S THE BIGGEST THREAT.

38:00.312 --> 38:01.813
>> MEGAN.

38:01.847 --> 38:04.950
>> JILLIAN.

38:04.983 --> 38:10.356
>> SO THREE GIRLS AND THEN THE
GUYS?

38:10.389 --> 38:11.457
>> YEAH.

38:11.490 --> 38:12.691
>> YOU CAN TRUST ME.

38:12.724 --> 38:16.762
BUT IF IT'S TOO SOON, IT'S DAY
THREE, LIKE, I'M NOT GOING TO

38:16.795 --> 38:19.531
FORCE, ANY I'M NOT--
>> IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT,

38:19.565 --> 38:23.702
I'M GOING TO BACKDOOR PAUL.

38:23.735 --> 38:28.106
>> FOR ME, EVEN THOUGH PAUL IS
THE ONLY RETURNING PLAYER, I

38:28.139 --> 38:29.274
LOVE THE GUY.

38:29.307 --> 38:32.978
HE GAVE ME A FRIENDSHIP BRACE
AND THE HE SEEMS LIKE A VERY

38:33.011 --> 38:33.679
LOYAL GUY.

38:33.712 --> 38:37.115
I FEEL LIKE HE COULD BE AN ALLY.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.886
BUT I CAN'T TELL CORY BECAUSE
THIS IS HIS H.O.H.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.588
SO WHATEVER HE WANTS, I SUPPORT.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.323
>> I'M TELLING YOU THE GUY, HE'S
GOING TO PLAY BOTH SIDES.

38:45.357 --> 38:49.395
I DON'T THINK HE IS ALWAYS GOING
TO BE ON OUR SIDE.

38:49.428 --> 38:50.696
YOU BE I TALKED TO YOU?

38:50.729 --> 38:51.697
>> YEAH.

38:51.730 --> 38:52.297
>> TRUST.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.666
>> I TALK TO MATT, TRUST.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.167
I TALK TO HIM TAIN'T THERE.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.870
PUT IT THIS WAY-- PAUL IS SUCH A
WILD CARD.

38:58.904 --> 39:02.040
>> LIKE, TALKING TO PAUL, LIKE,
I TRUST HIM.

39:02.073 --> 39:04.910
HE'S JUST A GENUINE GUY, LIKE
LOYAL.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.512
YOU SAW LAST SEASON.

39:06.545 --> 39:09.180
BUT--
>> HE CAN-- HE DID IT ON BOTH

39:09.214 --> 39:12.250
SIDES, AND THEN HE WOULD GO IN
THE DIARY ROOM AND THEN...

39:12.283 --> 39:15.286
>> YEAR, IT'S A GAME NOW.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.039
* *
>> WITH ME BEING FIRST H.O.H., I

39:34.072 --> 39:36.975
UNDERSTAND HOW BIG OF A DECISION
THIS IS.

39:37.008 --> 39:37.809
HEY, Y'ALL.

39:37.843 --> 39:40.178
IT'S TIME FOR THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

39:40.211 --> 39:42.814
SO I'M SETTING THE TONE FOR THE
REST OF THE GAME.

39:42.848 --> 39:45.984
THERE ARE SOME CLEAR OUTSIDERS
IN THIS HOUSE, BUT THEN THERE'S

39:46.017 --> 39:46.952
ALSO PAUL.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.254
THE IDEA OF BACKDOING HIM IS
STILL ON MY MIND.

39:49.287 --> 39:52.991
BUT THEN AGAIN FIRK NOMINATE HIM
RIGHT AWAY, IT WOULD REALLY

39:53.024 --> 39:53.825
SHAKE THINGS UP.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.994
THIS IS THE NOMINATION CEREMONY.

39:56.027 --> 39:59.030
IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AS THE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE

39:59.064 --> 40:01.366
TWO HOUSEGUESTS FOR EVICTION.

40:01.399 --> 40:05.837
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE THE
KEYS OF THE HOUSEGUESTS I HAVE

40:05.871 --> 40:07.506
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

40:07.539 --> 40:11.610
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO LOCK IN
MY NOMINATIONS AND THEIR FACES

40:11.643 --> 40:13.211
WILL APPEAR ON THE MEMORY WALL.

40:13.244 --> 40:24.723
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST THEY HAVE
NOMINATED IS... THE NEXT

40:24.756 --> 40:34.800
HOUSEGUEST THAT I HAVE NOMINATED
IS...

40:34.800 --> 40:40.639
HOUSEGUEST THAT I HAVE NOMINATED
IS...

40:40.672 --> 40:46.011
>> I'VE NOMINATED YOU, JILLIAN,
AND YOU, MEGAN.

40:46.044 --> 40:54.052
MEGAN, I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU
THAT MUCH.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.655
JILLIAN, I FEEL LIKE YOUR
ASSOCIATION LIES WITH MEGAN.

40:56.688 --> 41:00.358
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

41:00.391 --> 41:03.061
>> I FEEL SO PISSED.

41:03.094 --> 41:05.764
THIS EARLY IN THE DPAIRNLG I'VE
ALREADY BEEN ON THE BLOCK TWICE.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.666
THAT SUCKS.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.434
BUT I THINK MEGAN IS THE TARGET.

41:09.467 --> 41:13.138
AND I'M HOPING THAT SHE GETS THE
VOTES AND NOT ME.

41:13.171 --> 41:16.942
>> I KNEW I MIGHT BE GOING UP ON
THE BLOCK THIS WEEK, BUT I'M NOT

41:16.975 --> 41:18.443
OUT OF THIS HOUSE YET.

41:18.476 --> 41:22.648
I AM GOING TO FIGHT MY BUTT OFF
FOR THIS VETO.

41:22.681 --> 41:26.785
AND I AM GOING TO LIVE TO SEE
ANOTHER DAY IN THIS HOUSE.

41:26.818 --> 41:27.886
WATCH ME.

41:27.919 --> 41:29.688
>> I THINK I'M OKAY WITH CODY.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.558
AND I THINK MY SOCIAL GAME HAS
BEEN SET UP WELL ENOUGH TO GET

41:32.591 --> 41:34.359
ME BY THE FIRST WEEK.

41:34.392 --> 41:35.293
BUT IT'S "BIG BROTHER."

41:35.326 --> 41:37.195
AND I'M THE ONLY VET IN THE
HOUSE.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.230
SO YOU CAN NEVER BE TOO SURE.

41:39.264 --> 41:42.200
>> I'VE SORT OF SHOWED EVERYONE
MY POSITION IN THE HOUSE.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.704
I'VE SHOWED EVERYONE HOW I
OPERATE AS AN H.O.H.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.573
I NOMINATED BOTH THE LADIES.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.808
BUT, PAUL, DUDE, YOU'RE STILL ON
MY RADAR.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.978
IF ONE OF THOSE GIRLS COMES OFF
THE BLOCK, YOU'RE STILL A

41:53.011 --> 41:54.145
POSSIBILITY.

41:54.179 --> 41:56.748
>> TUNE IN SUNDAY AT 8:00, 7:00
CENTRAL TO FIND OUT WHICH

41:56.782 --> 42:02.320
HOUSEGUEST WILL BE TEMPTED
INSIDE THE "DEN OF TEMPTATION."

42:02.353 --> 42:07.025
THEN WEDNESDAY AT 8:00, 7:00
CENTRAL, FIND OUT IF THE POWER

42:07.058 --> 42:09.160
OF VETO SAVES ONE OF THE
NOMINEES.

42:09.194 --> 42:12.497
AND ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT, AT
9:00, 8:00 CENTRAL, IT'S THE

42:12.530 --> 42:14.866
FIRST LIVE EVICTION OF THE
SUMMER.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.035
WHO WILL GO HOME AND WHO WILL
RISE TO POWER.

42:17.068 --> 42:23.875
ALL THIS AND MORE ON "BIG
BROTHER"!
