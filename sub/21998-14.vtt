I needed that talk.

40:14.220 --> 40:15.418
REBECCA: That's great.

40:16.161 --> 40:18.143
- Can I be really honest?
- Yeah.

40:20.551 --> 40:22.141
I'm not sure I'm at the right tree.

40:22.927 --> 40:24.117

41:01.253 --> 41:02.554
Sorry about earlier.

41:03.351 --> 41:04.850
It's a weird day for Daddy.

41:06.817 --> 41:07.821
I know.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.398
I've been taking the landline
off the hook.

41:14.622 --> 41:15.708
Why?

41:16.981 --> 41:19.515
'Cause the social workers
only call the landline.

41:21.956 --> 41:24.169
- You don't want us to foster again?
- No.

41:24.204 --> 41:26.182
No. I, uh...

41:26.978 --> 41:28.123
I don't mind that.

41:30.878 --> 41:32.212
You found Grandpa.

41:33.903 --> 41:36.336
And... but then you found Deja.

41:38.722 --> 41:40.379
Then you found a new job.

41:42.341 --> 41:44.808
It's like you want a new life.

41:46.057 --> 41:47.163
Tess.

41:48.502 --> 41:50.262
You are my entire world.

41:51.773 --> 41:55.015
- You know that, right?
- I guess.

41:55.112 --> 41:56.444
You guess?

42:00.569 --> 42:03.537
Hey, you never knew my dad, Jack.

42:05.581 --> 42:07.694
But, oh, man, he was the best dad ever.

42:09.248 --> 42:10.858
All I ever wanted to do with my life

42:10.883 --> 42:12.923
was be half the dad he was.

42:14.220 --> 42:16.179
And I was so scared about that.

42:17.928 --> 42:20.647
That I wouldn't be good
when the time came.

42:22.488 --> 42:24.491
And then you were born.

42:26.272 --> 42:27.612
And my life flipped.

42:30.545 --> 42:32.237
It did a somersault, you know?

42:33.706 --> 42:35.471
And, uh, I realized...

42:36.108 --> 42:37.844
I don't even have to try at this.

42:39.245 --> 42:41.145
I'm gonna be the best dad ever

42:41.180 --> 42:43.312
because I love this little girl so much

42:43.348 --> 42:45.408
that I don't even have a choice.

42:49.475 --> 42:51.074
You're my number one, baby girl.

42:53.058 --> 42:55.692

that made my life somersault.
