WEBVTT

00:02.979 --> 00:07.449
(Purposeful footsteps)

00:09.256 --> 00:10.790
(Knocking)

00:12.734 --> 00:14.268
Don't judge me for what
I'm about to ask you to do.

00:14.303 --> 00:16.537
Come inside, please.

00:16.572 --> 00:18.339
- What're you about to...
- It does not matter. It doesn't matter.

00:18.373 --> 00:20.641
What?

00:20.675 --> 00:23.877
That.

00:23.912 --> 00:26.080
- That's why you called me in here?
- Yeah, look at it!

00:26.115 --> 00:28.047
- I'm looking.
- No! Look at it.

00:28.082 --> 00:29.983
Uh, it looks like a bug...

00:30.017 --> 00:32.384
- Yeah.
- Trapped under a glass.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.454
I Googled that bug. It's
some sort of demonic cricket

00:34.489 --> 00:36.756
that "takes chunks out of
your skin when provoked."

00:36.790 --> 00:38.791
Chunks is the word that Google used.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.527
You Googled a bug?

00:40.561 --> 00:43.463
Yeah. I have a thing about
bugs with milky exoskeletons.

00:43.498 --> 00:44.664
I have this irrational fear they
are gonna crawl into my mouth

00:44.698 --> 00:47.467
and nest at night, so...

00:47.502 --> 00:49.168
So, what do you want me to do, kill it?

00:49.202 --> 00:52.104
(Sighs) No, I think I
just need moral support

00:52.139 --> 00:55.274
while I slip a piece of paper
under the glass with the bug

00:55.308 --> 00:58.010
and take the trapped
bug and walk it outside.

00:58.044 --> 01:00.078
Or we could just... kill it.

01:00.113 --> 01:03.149
No, that's not the way to go.
Oh! Oh my God! It's fleeing!

01:03.183 --> 01:04.849
- Whoa, it's fast!
- It's fleeing into the bathroom.

01:04.884 --> 01:06.118
That's why you use the cup method,

01:06.153 --> 01:08.053
because you'd keep it contained!

01:08.087 --> 01:10.555
Now it's just all out!

01:10.589 --> 01:12.349
Well... I guess I don't
even need to be here.

01:12.358 --> 01:14.192
Well, it's h...

01:14.226 --> 01:15.527
Now it's hiding somewhere in the darkness

01:15.561 --> 01:17.262
Waiting for nightfall.

01:17.296 --> 01:20.598
I... I can't... I can't sleep
here. I can't sleep here.

01:20.633 --> 01:22.134
Not with your mouth open anyway.

01:22.168 --> 01:26.304
<i>That's not a nice thing to say to me.</i>

01:26.338 --> 01:27.973
You know, sometimes I forget what
life was like before I knew you.

01:28.007 --> 01:30.607
Okay, bye-bye! Bye. Yup.

01:30.642 --> 01:32.777
'Kay. Hope you catch it!

01:32.811 --> 01:34.645
(Door shuts heavily)

01:34.680 --> 01:37.947
I can hear it. I can hear it.

01:39.216 --> 01:41.719
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -

01:43.955 --> 01:46.256
(Shower water turns off, water drains)

01:48.060 --> 01:49.593
(Tapping)

01:49.627 --> 01:51.195
<i>What the hell?</i>

01:51.229 --> 01:53.764
<i>Hey! Where's my towel?!</i>

01:53.799 --> 01:56.066
<i>John?</i>

01:56.100 --> 02:00.070
<i>Johnny?! Where's my towel?!</i>

02:00.104 --> 02:01.672
Anyways, I asked this kid to
come to the front of the class

02:01.706 --> 02:03.940
and solve this math equation

02:03.974 --> 02:07.444
and he was "pitching a tent." (Laughing)

02:07.478 --> 02:09.378
- He had a boner!
- Oh.

02:09.413 --> 02:13.149
And then I was thinking, these
are young boys, these poor kids,

02:13.184 --> 02:16.586
and it can't be easy having
a teacher like myself, so...

02:16.620 --> 02:20.023
- Mm...
- What was your question again?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.157
You know, it's been so
long I can't remember.

02:21.192 --> 02:23.492
(Door bursts open)

02:23.527 --> 02:26.562
There you are, John! Where did my towel go?

02:26.597 --> 02:29.665
Moira! Nanaimo bars.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.335
Accidentally doubled the batch
and Roland's on diabetes watch,

02:32.369 --> 02:34.870
so I thought why not share the wealth?

02:34.904 --> 02:36.805
Well, what a lovely gesture, huh, Moira?

02:36.840 --> 02:40.275
John, I had towel and now it's disappeared!

02:40.309 --> 02:41.777
There's a towel on the back of the door.

02:41.811 --> 02:43.445
No, that one has dirt on it!

02:43.479 --> 02:46.115
That's not dirt. I used it to kill a bug.

02:46.149 --> 02:48.652
(Moira screams in anguish)

02:50.286 --> 02:53.554
I'm sorry. I... I guess I'm stressed.

02:54.790 --> 02:58.260
Morning, Jocelyn!

02:58.294 --> 03:01.763
You know, Moira, you ever
need to just go somewhere

03:01.797 --> 03:04.299
to unwind and have some pampering,

03:04.333 --> 03:06.368
I know a great place in Elmdale.

03:06.402 --> 03:08.637
Let's not and say we did.

03:08.671 --> 03:11.072
You know, honey, a little
pampering might not be a bad idea.

03:11.106 --> 03:15.509
Could alleviate some of that
weight your carrying around.

03:15.543 --> 03:18.611
So now I'm fat and stressed?

03:19.948 --> 03:21.783
Emotional weight. Emotional.

03:21.817 --> 03:24.852
John, go find a towel now, please,

03:24.887 --> 03:27.288
or I will strip out of this robe

03:27.322 --> 03:31.025
and I will air dry in the street!

03:31.059 --> 03:32.793
Okay, well, I'm just gonna go home. Sorry.

03:32.827 --> 03:34.728
No, no, no. I didn't
say I didn't want them.

03:34.763 --> 03:37.498
Thank you. (Door closes)

03:37.532 --> 03:39.866
A little pampering. Great idea.

03:39.901 --> 03:42.703
- I think so, yeah.
- Yeah.

03:42.737 --> 03:45.572
(Truck zooms by, "Open" sign squeaks)

03:48.576 --> 03:51.444
Hey, Twy. (Sighs)

03:51.478 --> 03:53.012
(Twyla takes customer's order)

03:53.046 --> 03:55.581
Um, Twy...

03:55.616 --> 03:59.419
What is in the "Meadow Harvest" smoothie?

03:59.453 --> 04:01.621
Uh... you know, it changes every day.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.289
Just depends on my mood.

04:03.324 --> 04:05.891
But it's all organic, earthy ingredients.

04:05.926 --> 04:08.361
Okay, so it's like fruity or... ?

04:08.395 --> 04:10.662
Yes, it is. Yup. At times.

04:10.697 --> 04:13.898
And then other times, not.

04:13.933 --> 04:16.868
Okay! Well, today, is it more
fruity or more vegetably... ?

04:16.902 --> 04:18.837
No, I don't know.

04:18.870 --> 04:21.339
I've gotta check in the
back and see what we have.

04:21.374 --> 04:24.810
So Meadow Harvest doesn't refer
to anything... in particular.

04:24.844 --> 04:27.979
No, Meadow Harvest is
exactly how it sounds.

04:28.013 --> 04:30.481
It just changes everyday.

04:30.515 --> 04:33.617
Mm... okay. All right.
Well, I'll just um...

04:33.652 --> 04:36.253
Do that that then...
the Meadow Harvest thing.

04:36.287 --> 04:39.657
- Great!
- Thank you.

04:39.691 --> 04:41.191
Hi.

04:42.728 --> 04:44.595
Hi.

04:44.629 --> 04:47.130
Um, I just feel like I have to warn you,

04:47.165 --> 04:48.798
what you just ordered is gonna...

04:48.833 --> 04:50.600
Run through you like Niagara Falls.

04:50.634 --> 04:52.502
Excuse me?

04:52.536 --> 04:55.538
Uh, she's a sweet girl but
her smoothies are deadly.

04:55.573 --> 04:57.741
Um, I usually prescribe them to my patients

04:57.775 --> 04:59.676
when they're feeling a little... backed up.

04:59.710 --> 05:01.711
That's a lot of information.

05:01.746 --> 05:04.681
I'm... I'm... I'm
kidding. I'm actually not.

05:04.715 --> 05:07.751
I've absolutely done
that... With her smoothies.

05:07.985 --> 05:09.785
So are you a doctor or... ?

05:09.819 --> 05:11.587
I'm a veterinarian.

05:11.621 --> 05:14.223
Oh! It's basically the same thing.

05:14.257 --> 05:16.559
- Ted.
- Um... Alexis.

05:16.593 --> 05:19.695
I know. Without sounding too forward,

05:19.729 --> 05:23.799
I've seen you around and
uh... You know, I have to say,

05:23.833 --> 05:25.367
I think that you are
the most beautiful girl

05:25.402 --> 05:27.103
this town's ever seen.

05:27.137 --> 05:29.170
(Feigning humility) What? No.

05:29.205 --> 05:32.173
I'm sure there's like
another girl... somewhere.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.909
No, I mean it.

05:33.943 --> 05:35.744
Yeah.

05:35.778 --> 05:39.014
Well, it's really nice of you to say.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.850
I would love to take you
out to dinner sometime.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.219
- Oh!
- I feel good about this one.

05:44.253 --> 05:48.956
Yeah, it's a little less fruity
but a little more... something.

05:48.991 --> 05:51.659
Mm!

05:51.693 --> 05:52.760
Mm...

05:55.163 --> 05:57.397
(Giggles and spits)

05:59.534 --> 06:01.102
(Mouths) Oh my God.

06:01.136 --> 06:04.705
(Door opens and closes)

06:04.740 --> 06:09.243
So... about the bug thing.

06:09.277 --> 06:12.146
No explanation necessary.
You've got a thing about bugs.

06:12.180 --> 06:13.614
No, I don't have a thing about bugs.

06:13.648 --> 06:15.982
It was one bug, and that bug was milky.

06:16.017 --> 06:18.519
So... you're a man at one with nature.

06:18.553 --> 06:20.086
Yeah. I could not be
more at one with nature.

06:20.121 --> 06:22.088
I do Coachella every year, so...

06:22.123 --> 06:24.691
Mm. Oh! So you'd be... Into coming with me

06:24.725 --> 06:27.226
on the annual Turkey shoot then.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.963
That's something that should excite you.

06:29.997 --> 06:32.165
What?

06:32.199 --> 06:34.600
- The Turkey shoot?
- Mm.

06:34.635 --> 06:38.838
Roland's annual thing. We
go out and we hunt turkeys.

06:38.873 --> 06:42.275
Been doing it every year since I was
far too young to be holding a gun.

06:42.309 --> 06:44.443
Yeah... yes. Yeah. Let's do that.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.148
I was joking.

06:49.182 --> 06:52.417
I have a strong feeling
that would not be your thing.

06:52.451 --> 06:54.953
And what do think "my thing" is exactly?

06:54.988 --> 06:56.555
High thread count sheets?

06:56.589 --> 06:57.856
Colognes that smell like fireplace...

06:57.891 --> 06:59.491
Okay. Well, it might surprise you to know

06:59.492 --> 07:00.793
that I have more than one thing,

07:00.827 --> 07:04.396
so I will happily go with you on the hunt!

07:04.430 --> 07:06.699
Nothing would make me
more excited than to...

07:06.733 --> 07:09.067
Go hunting for...

07:09.101 --> 07:11.502
- Turkeys.
- Turkeys... with you,

07:11.536 --> 07:14.572
So... is this a tweed or a camo situation?

07:18.410 --> 07:21.478
Okay, did anyone actually see this pillow

07:21.513 --> 07:23.480
come out of this container?

07:23.515 --> 07:26.784
Seriously?! Go. To. Hell!

07:26.819 --> 07:28.419
You're off... you're a fool!

07:28.453 --> 07:30.221
Okay, Moira, why are we doing this?

07:30.255 --> 07:31.655
Why don't we wait for the girl to come in

07:31.690 --> 07:32.756
and help us make the bed?

07:32.790 --> 07:35.092
She never comes, John.

07:35.126 --> 07:37.194
(Knock at the door, Johnny sighs)

07:37.229 --> 07:41.365
<i>No. Bastard. Bastard!</i>

07:41.399 --> 07:43.166
- Jocelyn! Hi!
- Johnny.

07:43.201 --> 07:45.302
<i>Oh good, you're here, Moira.</i>

07:45.337 --> 07:48.138
I was just booking myself an
appointment with Janine at the salon

07:48.172 --> 07:50.840
and I said to myself, "wow,

07:50.874 --> 07:53.409
Moira really looks like
she needs a pick-me-up,"

07:53.444 --> 07:55.511
so I booked you a Mani too!

07:55.546 --> 07:57.880
Little girls spa day on me.

07:57.914 --> 08:01.217
Wow! What a nice gesture!

08:01.252 --> 08:04.019
May I see a spa treatment menu?

08:04.054 --> 08:05.821
Oh, well, it's just a salon,

08:05.856 --> 08:07.857
so they don't really do
all that kind of stuff.

08:07.891 --> 08:10.259
But she does give a mean scalp massage.

08:10.293 --> 08:13.428
Really mean?

08:13.463 --> 08:15.898
If you requested that, I guess, yeah.

08:15.932 --> 08:18.000
Moira, this sounds too good to pass up.

08:18.034 --> 08:20.035
Please, please do this, for me.

08:21.905 --> 08:23.505
Let me rephrase that.

08:23.539 --> 08:25.775
Do it for you because you deserve...

08:25.809 --> 08:28.109
Yes! My answer's yes, Jocelyn. Thank you.

08:28.144 --> 08:29.478
- Yay!
- Oh, yes.

08:29.512 --> 08:30.679
(Birds chirp)

08:32.649 --> 08:35.850
So, what're you doing tonight?

08:35.885 --> 08:38.052
Making chili. Might do some laundry.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.591
(Awkward silence)

08:44.594 --> 08:46.127
A polite person would now ask me

08:46.162 --> 08:48.896
what I'm doing tonight.

08:48.930 --> 08:51.499
That's what this is about? Sorry.

08:51.533 --> 08:52.933
Um... what're you doing tonight?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.735
Ted's taking me out.

08:54.770 --> 08:58.306
- Ted.
- Mm-hmm. Ted.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.776
I don't know his last name.
The... the, um, doctor.

09:01.810 --> 09:03.678
- The vet?
- Yeah, the doctor.

09:03.712 --> 09:06.680
The animal doctor.

09:06.714 --> 09:11.418
Yeah, we went to high school together.

09:11.452 --> 09:13.019
I think you'd be good for each other.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.189
Do you?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.557
I think he has everything
you're looking for in a husband.

09:18.591 --> 09:21.294
A husband?

09:21.328 --> 09:24.297
What am I looking for in a husband?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.865
Money.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.036
Hmm.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.941
(Birds chirp, crow caws)

09:35.975 --> 09:39.177
Did you know Richard Gere's
middle name is Tiffany?

09:39.212 --> 09:41.179
So Ted's taking me to Antonio's.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.181
What's Antonio's?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.951
<i>It's this little buffet
restaurant in Elmdale,</i>

09:45.985 --> 09:48.419
but he said that we
could order off the menu.

09:48.454 --> 09:49.821
Are you sure you wanna be
traveling so far out of town

09:49.856 --> 09:51.656
with a person you just met?

09:51.690 --> 09:53.858
I went on a blind date to Bali with Leo,

09:53.892 --> 09:57.761
so... I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be fine.

09:57.795 --> 09:59.296
So who is this person?

09:59.331 --> 10:01.832
Mm... he's cute.

10:01.867 --> 10:04.168
- And...
- And...

10:04.202 --> 10:05.836
He doesn't have a trust fund,

10:05.871 --> 10:09.673
so, like, that's a refreshing
change of pace for me.

10:09.707 --> 10:12.208
Speaking of people without trust funds,

10:12.230 --> 10:13.965
what about that beardy thing
that you spend time with?

10:13.999 --> 10:15.599
- What? Mutt?
- Yeah.

10:15.634 --> 10:17.868
- No. Ew. It's not a thing.
- Right.

10:17.902 --> 10:20.304
<i>- I'm looking for Alexis.
- Oh, you have a what?</i>

10:20.338 --> 10:22.373
<i>- (Gasps)
- A thing with Alexis tonight?</i>

10:22.407 --> 10:24.341
- Uh, a date.
- I think that's Ted.

10:24.376 --> 10:26.044
(Gasps) Why is he over there?

10:26.078 --> 10:28.979
Because he knows how much I love it when
mom and dad interrogate your boyfriends.

10:29.113 --> 10:30.981
- I wonder what they're asking?
- No, David!

10:31.015 --> 10:33.284
Tell me, Ted, are your
parents still together?

10:33.318 --> 10:34.485
Uh, no. They divorced
when I was in high school.

10:34.519 --> 10:36.987
Oh... alcoholism.

10:37.021 --> 10:39.089
No, I think they just realized that
they were better off as friends.

10:39.123 --> 10:42.058
<i>- Tsk, tsk. Affair. Poor thing.
- Hmm.</i>

10:42.093 --> 10:43.860
(Door opens) Okay. That's enough,
everybody. Thank you so much. Hey!

10:43.895 --> 10:45.328
Ted: Hey! Got the wrong room. Hi.

10:45.362 --> 10:47.030
- Yeah, you did. Okay.
- Yeah. Uh...

10:47.065 --> 10:50.500
Hey! I know you!

10:50.534 --> 10:52.602
Yeah, no, Stevie brought you in to see me.

10:52.636 --> 10:54.938
I had the pleasure of treating
your son's panic attack.

10:54.972 --> 10:58.407
So Antonio's buffet, huh?

10:58.441 --> 11:00.876
- So many choices, one little plate.
- Okay, you know what?

11:00.911 --> 11:04.580
Bye, guys. We'll see you in the morning!

11:04.614 --> 11:06.882
"In the morning!" Very funny, Alexis!

11:06.917 --> 11:08.818
Don't even think about
it. Ain't gonna happen.

11:08.852 --> 11:10.953
- Ted, not on the first date.
- Yes, sir.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.856
Don't wanna kill the buzz, but have fun.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.291
Alexis seems to have found
someone to keep her busy.

11:16.326 --> 11:18.293
What about you, David?

11:18.328 --> 11:21.096
I'm gonna go to bed. I have to be up early

11:21.130 --> 11:24.099
I stupidly agreed to go
hunting with Stevie tomorrow.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.334
- Hunting?!
- Yeah.

11:25.368 --> 11:26.602
- Hunting?!
- Yeah.

11:26.636 --> 11:28.237
You said hunting?!

11:28.271 --> 11:31.005
Yeah.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.040
(Door closes)

11:34.110 --> 11:35.777
Wow.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.880
(Crickets chirp, cell phone alarm rings)

11:40.716 --> 11:42.783
(Sighs)

11:42.817 --> 11:44.652
- Agh!
- It's me!

11:44.686 --> 11:46.787
- Who is it?
- It's your father!

11:46.821 --> 11:48.656
What're you doing lurking in our bedroom?

11:48.690 --> 11:50.824
I'm not "lurking" in your
room. Your alarm is going off,

11:50.859 --> 11:52.826
you're not turning off your alarm!

11:52.861 --> 11:55.329
Shoot!

11:55.364 --> 11:56.497
You know, I'm telling you, I... I... I...

11:56.531 --> 11:58.532
I'm not comfortable with you going hunting.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.401
I don't feel comfortable with it either!

12:00.435 --> 12:03.902
End. This. Now. Thank you.

12:05.006 --> 12:07.274
- All right, just be careful please!
- Okay. Thanks.

12:07.308 --> 12:09.628
You and your nightgown can
tippy-toe back to bed. I'm late.

12:11.000 --> 12:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here

12:19.260 --> 12:20.528
(Foliage crunches underfoot)

12:22.364 --> 12:23.364
(Coveralls zip)

12:25.066 --> 12:27.502
You ever killed before?

12:27.536 --> 12:30.737
Have I ever killed before? No.

12:31.808 --> 12:34.108
Elton John used to have an annual
hunt at his place in Windsor,

12:34.142 --> 12:35.742
but that was more about the lunch.

12:35.776 --> 12:37.677
(Yelling) Turkey virgin!

12:40.815 --> 12:44.183
Does this come in a slimmer cut?

12:44.218 --> 12:45.418
Here. You can take this one.

12:45.452 --> 12:48.121
It has a scope so you can see the head.

12:48.155 --> 12:51.825
Okay! (Clears throat)
Gather round, my shooters.

12:51.859 --> 12:54.193
Bob has a little prayer
here he'd like to offer up.

12:54.228 --> 12:57.229
Just a little convo with the
big man upstairs for a second.

12:57.263 --> 13:00.165
It happens every year.

13:00.199 --> 13:02.334
Our God, in these times of need,

13:04.604 --> 13:06.872
our light in these times of darkness...

13:06.907 --> 13:08.641
- David, do you wanna...
- Oh.

13:11.044 --> 13:13.078
(Lid snaps, traffic rumbles nearby)

13:13.112 --> 13:16.313
So is it, like, a small town thing

13:16.348 --> 13:19.884
to end the first date
with a kiss on the cheek?

13:19.919 --> 13:21.152
- (Laughs silently)
- What?

13:21.186 --> 13:23.287
Nothing.

13:23.321 --> 13:25.456
What?! It's not like it
was a bad date or anything.

13:25.490 --> 13:28.225
Well, it sounds like things got crazy.

13:28.260 --> 13:30.528
Yeah! I actually introduced him to Beyonce

13:30.563 --> 13:33.964
on the car ride on the way
home, so that was very special.

13:33.998 --> 13:36.499
It's just, if the date's a success with me,

13:36.534 --> 13:38.936
I'll let you know it.

13:38.970 --> 13:40.503
Okay... (Laughs)

13:40.538 --> 13:42.205
(Car rumbles)

13:44.809 --> 13:46.109
I mean, he might as well
have shaken your hand.

13:46.143 --> 13:47.578
Well, he did that too.

13:47.612 --> 13:49.813
- Hey!
- Hey!

13:49.847 --> 13:52.314
I thought that you could
use a proper smoothie!

13:52.348 --> 13:55.384
Well, lucky for you,
we're just finishing up.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.819
(Forced kiss)

14:00.591 --> 14:04.126
Uh, hey, Mutt. Do you want a ride?

14:04.160 --> 14:05.828
- I'm good.
- Are you sure? It's a long walk.

14:05.862 --> 14:07.229
I like walking.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.198
Suit yourself, bud.

14:09.232 --> 14:10.899
So you don't mind wrapping up?

14:14.036 --> 14:15.670
(Door bangs shut) Bye!

14:15.705 --> 14:17.472
(Car rumbles away)

14:21.677 --> 14:23.377
So how are your bowels? Good and tight?

14:23.412 --> 14:26.047
Yes. Thank you for the concern.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.049
Well, I just wanna make sure
you got the stomach for this

14:28.084 --> 14:31.719
'cause you, you kinda seem like
an indoors-y sort of guy to me.

14:31.753 --> 14:35.756
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, delicate. Fragile. Scrimpy.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.257
Thank you.

14:39.427 --> 14:40.861
Okay, get down.

14:43.564 --> 14:44.932
(Grunting and sighing)

14:47.401 --> 14:49.502
Have you ever held a gun before?

14:49.536 --> 14:52.271
Uh, yeah, but it wasn't this... heavy,

14:52.305 --> 14:54.473
which makes me think that
Elton's was actually a toy.

14:54.508 --> 14:56.308
All right, you gotta...

14:56.343 --> 14:58.778
Treat it like it's a newborn baby.

14:58.812 --> 15:00.713
Have to admit, not into babies

15:00.748 --> 15:03.883
so it's kind of a guessing game for me.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.417
Oh, you got soft hands.

15:05.452 --> 15:07.486
Okay, thank you. Thanks.

15:07.521 --> 15:08.987
You don't have to do this.

15:09.022 --> 15:12.323
Do what? Have fun?

15:12.358 --> 15:15.260
Smell like manure? Get called "scrimpy"?

15:15.294 --> 15:16.895
Who wouldn't wanna sign up for this?

15:16.929 --> 15:18.263
Yeah.

15:18.297 --> 15:20.132
(Diner door opens, music plays)

15:24.569 --> 15:27.004
Oh, uh, Jocelyn, would you grab us a table

15:27.039 --> 15:28.839
while I speak with my husband, please.

15:28.874 --> 15:31.441
Well, he should join us!
And... between you and me,

15:31.476 --> 15:33.177
people are noticing you!

15:33.211 --> 15:34.979
(Chuckles politely)

15:40.719 --> 15:43.619
Excuse me, cowboy, have
you seen my husband?

15:43.654 --> 15:47.023
Oh my God. Oh, oh, oh... (Laughs)

15:47.058 --> 15:50.093
Look at you. Boy, you look like...

15:50.127 --> 15:51.961
Who? Who do I look like?

15:51.996 --> 15:53.663
I wanna say Tanya Harding.

15:53.698 --> 15:55.131
Do you? How about... ?

15:58.836 --> 16:00.269
- Jocelyn!
- Mm-hmm.

16:00.304 --> 16:04.306
Oh my God, that's right! Why Jocelyn?

16:04.340 --> 16:05.741
Because everyone who
comes out of that salon

16:05.775 --> 16:07.943
looks just like Jocelyn.

16:07.977 --> 16:12.047
Wow! And is that you? Is that your... wig?

16:12.082 --> 16:14.416
No, it's a dead possum.
Yes, it's a wig, John.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.984
Is she still looking at us?

16:18.554 --> 16:22.290
Yes, she is. Yes. So what happened?

16:22.325 --> 16:24.125
I can't believe you're wearing this.

16:24.159 --> 16:26.293
This is what I get for being nice, John.

16:26.328 --> 16:28.429
I'm doing this for Jocelyn
because she paid for it,

16:28.463 --> 16:29.831
and it was her "little treat,"

16:29.865 --> 16:31.785
and I didn't have the
heart to rip it off my head

16:31.800 --> 16:33.835
much less torch it.

16:33.869 --> 16:35.002
So, now, until I get in the shower,

16:35.037 --> 16:36.677
I'm stuck looking like every other inmate

16:36.705 --> 16:39.173
in this godforsaken prison.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.475
She's coming over. I just told a joke.

16:41.509 --> 16:43.978
You did? (Laughs) You did!

16:44.012 --> 16:47.313
What do you think of your beautiful wife?

16:47.348 --> 16:49.983
Well, which... beautiful wife
are we talking about here, huh?

16:50.017 --> 16:52.518
Oh... (Laughs)

16:52.553 --> 16:55.555
Well, I can't tell you
how freeing it is, Jocelyn,

16:55.589 --> 16:58.792
to... to try something new like this. 'Tis.

16:58.826 --> 17:00.794
I mean, of course, as an actress,

17:00.828 --> 17:03.930
I can imagine what kind
of sad character might...

17:03.965 --> 17:05.865
<i>But not necessarily.</i>

17:05.898 --> 17:08.300
Sad?! You think this is a sad look?

17:08.334 --> 17:09.635
[Both] No! No.

17:09.669 --> 17:11.703
Not the look. No, Jocelyn,

17:11.738 --> 17:14.106
I'm talking about the inner sadness

17:14.141 --> 17:18.077
that would come from...
From living in such a...

17:18.111 --> 17:20.311
We have to get drinks. Several drinks,

17:20.346 --> 17:22.214
don't you think? Let's celebrate!

17:22.249 --> 17:25.516
Let's... celebrate drinking!
Okay. (Awkward laugh)

17:25.550 --> 17:27.585
(Turkey gobbles) Okay, David,

17:27.618 --> 17:30.354
<i>it's all yours. Aim for the face.</i>

17:30.389 --> 17:32.023
(Whispering) It's looking at me.

17:32.057 --> 17:34.725
That's it. You're locked
in. It's just you and him.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.727
- (Turkey gobbles)
- Okay...

17:36.762 --> 17:38.462
(Sharp inhale)

17:38.497 --> 17:39.664
(Whispering) Just point and shoot, David.

17:39.698 --> 17:40.899
Hard to do when you're talking, Bob.

17:40.933 --> 17:41.966
There's no one talking now.

17:42.001 --> 17:43.301
- Bob, you're talking.
- What?

17:43.335 --> 17:44.769
- Stop talking!
- Too much talking!

17:44.803 --> 17:46.637
Shoot the bird, David! Shoot it!

17:46.672 --> 17:47.538
Ronnie honestly, if you're
not gonna shoot it, I...

17:47.572 --> 17:49.173
(loud blast)

17:52.043 --> 17:54.278
(David gasps, horrified)

17:54.313 --> 17:56.714
- And... in the neck.
- It's still moving.

17:56.748 --> 17:59.216
Just let it bleed out.

17:59.250 --> 18:01.118
You okay?

18:01.152 --> 18:03.386
I feel like one of the Manson girls.

18:03.421 --> 18:05.488
First time's tough.

18:05.523 --> 18:06.956
Even tougher when you shoot it in the neck

18:06.990 --> 18:08.458
'cause then it takes longer to die.

18:08.492 --> 18:10.226
Okay, not helping, Ronnie.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.195
So, now what? Do we just...

18:12.229 --> 18:15.198
Wait until its Turkey family
comes and shoot them too?

18:15.232 --> 18:17.734
Hey, I think I see them.

18:17.768 --> 18:18.868
- (Turkeys gobble loudly)
- No, no.

18:18.902 --> 18:20.370
(Rhythmic knock at the door)

18:20.404 --> 18:22.305
<i>Yes! Heard you.</i>

18:25.608 --> 18:27.976
- Jocelyn! Hi.
- Hi.

18:28.010 --> 18:31.246
I just wanted to say how fun it
was to spend the day with you.

18:31.280 --> 18:34.650
Oh, Jocelyn, 'tis I who
owes you a big thank you.

18:34.684 --> 18:38.153
I also wanted to apologize
for Janine ruining your wig.

18:38.187 --> 18:39.555
No, don't be silly. I was...

18:39.589 --> 18:42.390
I was about to... Find a shower cap.

18:42.424 --> 18:44.692
I know you hate your hair, Moira.

18:44.727 --> 18:47.762
Almost as much as you hate this town.

18:47.796 --> 18:49.663
But there's a possibility you could be here

18:49.697 --> 18:51.432
a really long time.

18:51.467 --> 18:54.268
May I offer you something?

18:54.302 --> 18:57.872
The people here are
just trying to help you,

18:57.906 --> 19:01.075
and there'll be days when
your wigs need conditioning...

19:01.109 --> 19:04.912
Or one of your fashion-y
blouses shrinks in the dryer,

19:04.946 --> 19:09.083
and you'll have to go to Janine's
or get a shirt at the Blouse Barn,

19:09.117 --> 19:11.685
just like the rest of us.

19:11.719 --> 19:14.755
And I would hate for that
day to catch you by surprise.

19:14.789 --> 19:17.424
I don't hate this town, Jocelyn.

19:17.458 --> 19:21.695
It's just not mine,
and this is not my hair.

19:21.729 --> 19:23.062
I know. It's a wig.

19:23.097 --> 19:25.932
It's not my style.

19:25.966 --> 19:28.234
You? On you, it's adorable.

19:28.269 --> 19:30.503
You have a look that
says, "Hi. I'm Jocelyn,

19:30.537 --> 19:32.906
and I know who I am!"

19:32.940 --> 19:35.474
For that, you're very fortunate. You are.

19:35.509 --> 19:38.511
I don't who I am from
one moment to the next.

19:38.545 --> 19:43.216
So honestly, dear, I envy you, all right?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.951
But if you ever... Ever catch me shopping

19:45.985 --> 19:48.820
at the Blouse Barn,

19:48.854 --> 19:50.989
you must shoot me in the temple.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.324
Promise?

19:52.358 --> 19:55.394
Promise.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.062
My son is hunting right
now with your husband,

19:57.096 --> 19:59.064
so I... I know you people have guns.

20:04.335 --> 20:07.103
What about what we just
did, makes you think,

20:07.137 --> 20:09.873
"yeah, you know what? I wanna do
this year after year after year"?

20:09.907 --> 20:11.741
Was it the lying in the mud part

20:11.775 --> 20:14.310
or was it... Wearing the clothes (Sniffs)

20:14.344 --> 20:17.079
That smell like menthol
cigarettes and body odor?

20:17.114 --> 20:19.582
'cause usually it's more fun.

20:19.617 --> 20:22.585
Usually Ray comes and... gets wasted and...

20:22.620 --> 20:24.853
Spends the whole day
singing Carole King ballads.

20:24.888 --> 20:26.187
(Adjoining door opens) David, I...

20:26.222 --> 20:28.390
Need a towel, please.

20:28.424 --> 20:29.791
Is that a new wig? Because...

20:29.826 --> 20:31.106
You are reminding me of someone.

20:31.127 --> 20:33.094
Towel, please.

20:33.129 --> 20:36.331
I need my towels. Uh,
what... who did this to you?!

20:36.365 --> 20:37.866
You went to Janine's.

20:37.901 --> 20:40.068
Yes. Jocelyn took me to...

20:40.102 --> 20:42.738
(gasps) Jocelyn! You look like Jocelyn!

20:42.772 --> 20:46.373
Jocelyn. And what's your excuse?

20:46.408 --> 20:49.476
Oh, um... I shot a bird in the neck today.

20:49.511 --> 20:52.179
It was an indelible image
that I had scarred in my mind

20:52.213 --> 20:55.215
until I saw what was...
Happening up there with you.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.884
(Stifling laughter) So... thank you.

20:59.421 --> 21:01.288
I'm gonna get your towel.

21:05.726 --> 21:07.226
(Sighs)

21:07.228 --> 21:11.000
