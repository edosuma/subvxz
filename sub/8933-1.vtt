00:01.835 --> 00:02.402
This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:03.770
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.574
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.778
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.546
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:15.382 --> 00:16.950
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:17.917 --> 00:19.019
Yikes!

00:19.652 --> 00:20.820
Yaaaah...

00:23.523 --> 00:25.058
Yeaaaah!

00:25.058 --> 00:28.094
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.904
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:39.539 --> 00:40.740
Cyril Sneer!

00:44.444 --> 00:46.713
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:47.580 --> 00:49.082
the Raccoons!!

00:49.082 --> 00:51.718
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:04.097 --> 01:04.531
The magic of

01:04.531 --> 01:05.832
The magic
of the silver screen

01:05.832 --> 01:08.334
is coming to the
Evergreen forest.

01:08.334 --> 01:10.637
Cyril Sneer plans to immortalize

01:10.637 --> 01:13.039
the story of Saskatchewan Smith

01:13.039 --> 01:14.374
and the Prism of Zenda

01:14.374 --> 01:16.042
in a blockbuster movie.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.878
Mr. Knox and Lady Baden-Baden

01:18.878 --> 01:22.415
have kindly loaned Cyril
their world famous Prism

01:22.415 --> 01:24.217
to help publicize his movie.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.853
Lady Baden-Baden: Ooh,
I do hope you're taking

01:26.853 --> 01:28.655
good care of my Prism.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.924
You realize
it's been in my family

01:30.924 --> 01:33.259
ever since Saskatchewan Smith

01:33.259 --> 01:37.197
gave it to my
great-great-grandmamam.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.199
Now, I'm sure Mr. Sneer's

01:39.199 --> 01:42.402
security is fine, honeybunch.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.338
Besides, he's insured it,

01:45.338 --> 01:47.574
haven't you, Sir?

01:47.574 --> 01:49.242
Of course I have!

01:49.242 --> 01:51.945
Ehm, We-we'd better
get on with this.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.717
You were supposed
to get piranha.

01:57.717 --> 02:00.386
Saksatchewan Smith
never waded through

02:00.386 --> 02:02.188
gold fish infested rivers.

02:02.188 --> 02:05.492
Pig1: But boss, you only
gave us ten bucks to buy props.

02:05.492 --> 02:09.562
Don't give me
cheap excuses. Harumph.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.798
Movie lovers everywhere
have waited to see

02:11.798 --> 02:14.367
the story of Saskatchewan Smith.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.804
The man who fought his way
through trackless jungles,

02:19.472 --> 02:21.941
crossed piranha
infested rivers...

02:23.576 --> 02:25.478
They look
like goldfish to me.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.481
Facing death
every step of the way,

02:28.481 --> 02:31.284
knowing the slightest
mistake would turn him

02:31.284 --> 02:32.986
into food for the vultures...

02:35.155 --> 02:38.258
Until finally,
Saskatchewan Smith

02:38.258 --> 02:42.228
discovered the lost
city of Tiandor Bat.

02:42.228 --> 02:47.000
And there he found the
fabulous priceless gem...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.269
the Prism of Zenda.

02:53.106 --> 02:54.607
Ooh!

02:56.276 --> 02:58.545
Pig1: Aahh! Must've
blown a fuse, boss.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.915
I'll blow a fuse if you
don't get these lights back on!

03:01.915 --> 03:04.450
Ouch! Watch it!

03:04.450 --> 03:07.353
Look! Oh no!

03:07.353 --> 03:11.624
Uh... the Prism is gone!
Lady B-B: Oh! My precious prism!

03:11.624 --> 03:15.762
My precious prism is gone, Knoxy.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.965
Now, now,
don't fret mah dear.

03:18.965 --> 03:22.635
I'm sure Mr. Sneer
has an explanation.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.838
Don't you, Sir?

03:25.838 --> 03:28.708
Er..um.. of course I do!

03:28.708 --> 03:29.842
It's..um...

03:31.344 --> 03:33.713
Hidden! Yes, that's it!

03:33.713 --> 03:37.083
It's been hidden...
as part of um, ehm...

03:37.083 --> 03:39.819
part of the
publicity for the movie.

03:39.819 --> 03:42.722
Pig2: And whoever
finds it, wins a part

03:42.722 --> 03:46.192
in Mr. Sneer's
blockbuster movie,

03:46.192 --> 03:50.630
Saskatchewan Smith
and the Prism of Zenda.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.533
Wow! A part in the movie?

03:53.533 --> 03:57.337
Pig1: And everyone has
the run of Sneer mansion

03:57.337 --> 04:00.740
for twenty-four hours,
to find the gem.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.476
What?
I mean..that's right.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.479
I'm gonna find that gem.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.982
I'm gonna be a star!

04:16.356 --> 04:18.658
Aha! Here it is!

04:18.658 --> 04:21.628
My magnifying glass.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.029
Hurry up, Bert.

04:23.029 --> 04:24.931
Somebody will find
the Prism of Zenda

04:24.931 --> 04:27.000
before we get back
to Sneer mansion.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.735
Don't rush me, Ralph.

04:28.735 --> 04:31.838
A detective's got to
be properly prepared.

04:31.838 --> 04:34.641
Ehm, now...

04:34.641 --> 04:37.677
Let's go find that
hidden jewel, guys!

04:39.779 --> 04:41.948
Well, if it's
not in the room,

04:41.948 --> 04:43.750
somebody must have taken it!

04:43.750 --> 04:45.785
Pig1: I don't see how, boss.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.521
We were standing
guard every moment.

04:48.521 --> 04:49.956
Well, where is it then?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.758
Pig3: It's missing, boss.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.059
So's your brain!

04:53.059 --> 04:55.261
Check out everybody
who was in that room!

04:55.261 --> 04:58.131
We've got to find it
before Knox finds out!

04:58.131 --> 05:01.000
Pig1: Why don't you
just tell Mr Knox, boss?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.735
It's insured, isn't it?

05:02.735 --> 05:06.139
Do you know what those
gougers charge for insurance?

05:06.139 --> 05:08.541
Pig1: You mean, you
didn't insure it, boss?

05:08.541 --> 05:10.643
B-but you told Mr. Knox...

05:10.643 --> 05:12.545
I know what
I told Mr. Knox.

05:12.545 --> 05:15.281
Pig2: But that means,
if we don't find it,

05:15.281 --> 05:17.150
you'll have to pay Mr. Knox

05:17.150 --> 05:19.619
20 million dollars!!

05:19.619 --> 05:22.955
Why do you think I'm in
such a good mood, bacon breath?

05:22.955 --> 05:24.324
Okay, come on, come on!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.059
Look beind the desk!
Come on, come on!

05:26.059 --> 05:27.994
Let me get in there!

05:27.994 --> 05:30.330
Don't shove!
- Get off my foot!

05:30.330 --> 05:32.498
Green Bird:
Okay, everybody,
onward.!

05:32.498 --> 05:33.933
Yeah, let's follow him!

05:33.933 --> 05:35.335
Hey, don't let get away!

05:35.335 --> 05:38.171
It's gotta be
here' s about somewhere.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.939
Is it in here, Cedric?

05:39.939 --> 05:42.875
Cedric; I told you, Bert,
I don't know where it is.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.610
What do you
think you're doing?

05:44.610 --> 05:48.014
Looking for
the Prism of Zenda.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.315
Well, it's not here.

05:49.315 --> 05:52.452
Get out of my office,
you ring-tailed snoops!

05:52.452 --> 05:54.020
Okay Mr. Sneer,

05:54.020 --> 05:56.923
but Bert Raccoon,
ace detective,

05:56.923 --> 05:58.658
is not gonna give up!

05:58.658 --> 06:01.961
Ok, to the library men.

06:04.797 --> 06:06.866
Why did you
have to tell everyone,

06:06.866 --> 06:10.336
they could have the run of
the mansion for 24 hours!?

06:10.336 --> 06:12.572
They're driving me crazy!

06:14.507 --> 06:15.675
Didn't you hear me?!

06:15.675 --> 06:18.177
I said, get out and stay out!!

06:18.177 --> 06:21.280
Lady B-B: Mr. Sneer!
Oh,

06:21.280 --> 06:23.216
Sorry Lady Baden-Baden.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.717
Come in, come in.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.185
What can I do for you?

06:26.185 --> 06:29.389
Lady B-B: Well Mr. Sneer,
I'm just a teensy bit

06:29.389 --> 06:31.524
concerned about my prism.

06:31.524 --> 06:33.893
After all, there are a lot of

06:33.893 --> 06:37.363
'common types' running around
your mansion looking for it.

06:37.363 --> 06:40.266
And I know it's all
publicity for your movie,

06:40.266 --> 06:43.169
but I just want to
make sure it's safe.

06:43.169 --> 06:46.706
It is safe,
isn't it Mr. Sneer?

06:46.706 --> 06:50.410
Safe?
Of course it's safe.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.745
Er..um..as a
matter of fact it's uh...

06:52.745 --> 06:55.681
in the safe.
Yes, that's it.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.384
It's in the safe!

06:58.384 --> 07:00.086
I thought, the prism was

07:00.086 --> 07:02.889
hidden somehwere in the mansion.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.892
Er..no. I mean, yes...

07:05.892 --> 07:09.028
Um..there is a gem
hidden in the mansion.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.363
But it's a fake.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.566
The real prism is in the vault.

07:13.566 --> 07:16.436
It wouldn't do to leave
the real prism lying around.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.039
It might go..er..missing.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.509
I told you, Mr. Sneer
had things well in hand,

07:23.509 --> 07:25.578
my little turtle dove.

07:25.578 --> 07:28.514
Lady B-B: Oooh,
I'm sooo relieved.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.283
I'd be even more relieved,

07:30.283 --> 07:32.652
if I could see my prism.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.121
But it's..uh,
in the vault.

07:35.121 --> 07:40.593
Then, kindly lead
the way to the vault, Sir.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.232
You know,
it wouldn't surprise me

07:46.232 --> 07:48.835
if someone stole
the Prism of Zenda.

07:48.835 --> 07:52.538
I mean..after all,
it is priceless, isn't it?

07:52.538 --> 07:55.041
It's the sort of thing
people like to steal.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.277
But of course if
somebody had stolen it,

07:58.277 --> 08:00.480
I'd get it back. Honest.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.151
Lady B-B: Ooo, what a nice
vault you have Mr. Sneer.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.652
Where is the prism?

08:06.652 --> 08:09.255
It's..um.. in the safe.

08:09.255 --> 08:13.125
Then open it, Sir.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.397
Er.. I've
forgotten the combination.

08:18.397 --> 08:23.135
Pig3: Oh, 12, 14 and 33, boss.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.305
Ah yes! Thank you.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.144
It won't open.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.414
Pig1: Don't you
remember, boss?

08:35.414 --> 08:38.017
You told us to
set the time lock.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.820
You can't open it
for another eight hours.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.089
Did I? Of course I did.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.490
How could I have forgotten?

08:44.490 --> 08:48.461
Well, I suppose you might as
well leave, right Knox?

08:49.161 --> 08:51.297
I think we'd rather wait

08:51.297 --> 08:53.799
'til you open the safe.

08:53.799 --> 08:56.536
Wouldn't we, dearest?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
Wouldn't hear of it.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.539
It's damp down here.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.641
Why don't you get out...
I mean...

09:01.641 --> 09:03.209
go out.. to dinner.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.510
I'll, I'll buy.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.546
Lady B-B: Well, I am feeling

09:06.546 --> 09:08.781
a bit peckish.

09:08.781 --> 09:12.151
There is that new
restaurant that just opened.

09:12.151 --> 09:15.254
Chez Pricey.

09:15.254 --> 09:17.223
It's settled then.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.491
Dinner's on me!

09:18.491 --> 09:22.228
Now, that's mighty
neighbourly of you, Sir.

09:22.228 --> 09:27.767
We'll return for the
Prism of Zenda in eight hours.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.236
I'll be.. er...
looking forward to it.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.406
Eight hours, Sir.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.709
Aaah!

09:36.709 --> 09:40.012
Finally, a little
peace and quiet.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.214
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

09:42.214 --> 09:44.450
- Okay, come on!
- Over there!!

09:44.450 --> 09:46.886
Where does
a man have to go,

09:46.886 --> 09:49.789
to get some privacy
in his own house?

09:54.360 --> 09:57.763
Oh no! Are the
8 hours up already?

09:57.763 --> 10:00.433
Mr. Sneeer,
I believe it's time for us

10:00.433 --> 10:04.537
to have the Prism of Zenda.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.405
Uh.. of course...

10:06.405 --> 10:09.308
Care for a sandwich?
I made it myself.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.278
Lady B-B:
No, thank you, Mr. Sneer.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.549
We had a delightful
meal at Chez Pricey.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.752
Oh, the bill
came to a measly

10:19.752 --> 10:22.288
$350 dollars.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.424
Lady B-B: Not including
the tip, that is.

10:25.424 --> 10:29.862
Why..there's nothing
in this safe, Mr. Sneer?

10:29.862 --> 10:31.764
There isn't??

10:31.764 --> 10:34.233
You're right..uh,
Lady Baden-Baden!

10:34.233 --> 10:36.302
I..um..er..had the pigs

10:36.302 --> 10:39.071
take the gem to the uh, cleaners.

10:39.071 --> 10:40.940
Lady B-B: The cleaners?!

10:40.940 --> 10:42.642
The gem cleaners.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.144
Eh! It was..dirty.

10:45.144 --> 10:48.447
Nothing worse
than a dirty prism.

10:48.447 --> 10:53.119
Let us know where
this gem cleaner is, Sir,

10:53.119 --> 10:57.356
and we'll stop by and
collect the prism. Hmmm?

10:57.356 --> 11:00.726
I.. um, can't,
I..I don't know,

11:00.726 --> 11:02.828
which one the pigs took it into.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.665
Lady B-B: There can't be that
many gem cleaners around.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.933
You'd be surprised!

11:07.933 --> 11:09.335
Well my dear, I suppose,

11:09.335 --> 11:12.138
we'll have to wait
right here this time.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.674
Nonsense! Waste of time!

11:14.674 --> 11:16.976
Why don't you go...
uh.. shopping!

11:16.976 --> 11:20.446
Look at that old rag you're
wearing. Get a new one!

11:20.446 --> 11:22.915
Here, take my credit card!

11:22.915 --> 11:25.117
Lady B-B: Ooh! Well...

11:25.117 --> 11:27.153
No no, I won't
hear another word.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.288
I insist. Now get lost.

11:29.288 --> 11:31.490
I mean, run along, kids.

11:31.490 --> 11:34.427
Lady B-B: Uuh,
I do love shopping!

11:34.427 --> 11:38.931
Sometimes, I just
lose all control!

11:40.166 --> 11:43.602
Pig1: We just saw Knox
and Lady Baden-Baden, Sir.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.272
What happened?
I put'em off for now,

11:46.272 --> 11:48.474
but things are
getting out of hand.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.043
Pig1: You'd better
tell the truth, boss.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.945
Don't be ridiculous!

11:52.945 --> 11:55.514
I'd better find a better lie.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.651
And you three had
better produce that gem!

11:58.651 --> 12:00.352
Pig2: But we've checked everyone

12:00.352 --> 12:02.588
and we've looked
everywhere, Sir.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.356
Well,
look everywhere else!

12:06.225 --> 12:08.894
Where's my sandwiiiich?

12:10.129 --> 12:12.398
I've told you
a hundred times, Bert.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.499
I don't know!

12:13.499 --> 12:15.501
We've been
all over this place,

12:15.501 --> 12:17.203
and it's just not here.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.371
It's gotta
be here somewhere.

12:19.371 --> 12:22.208
I mean, it just didn't fly away.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.709
That's it!

12:23.709 --> 12:25.544
It's a trained parrot!

12:25.544 --> 12:27.413
The parrot took the gem.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.749
It must be up there
in the rafters.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.718
Pig1: If we don't
find that gem,

12:32.718 --> 12:35.087
you know, what
the boss'll do to us.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.556
Pig3: It doesn't
bear thinking about.

12:37.556 --> 12:38.824
Pig1: The bears!!

12:38.824 --> 12:41.594
There was a butler bear
standing right beside us

12:41.594 --> 12:43.195
when the lights went out.

12:43.195 --> 12:44.764

Anybody want to go fishing?

13:44.089 --> 13:46.258
It's all Knox's fault!

13:46.258 --> 13:49.161
He shouldn't have loaned
me the Prism of Zenda.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.398
Here's your
credit card, Mr. Sneer.

13:53.599 --> 13:56.235
Ouh! It's all worn out!

13:56.235 --> 13:59.505
Lady B-B: Yesssss...
I got a little carried away.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.274
I had to rent a truck
to take everything home.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.778
Has the Prism of Zenda
come back from the cleaners?

14:05.778 --> 14:08.447
Well, uh,
the fact is..er...

14:08.447 --> 14:11.283
The gem cleaners was..robbed!!

14:11.283 --> 14:15.287
Lady B-B: Ooh!
My prism! It's gone!

14:15.287 --> 14:18.457
Oh, Knoxy, my prism is gone!
My baby!

14:18.457 --> 14:20.993
Now don't fret, mah dear!

14:20.993 --> 14:22.995
It's insured...

14:22.995 --> 14:24.463
right, Mr. Sneer?

14:24.463 --> 14:26.832
I'll get it back!
I promise!

14:26.832 --> 14:29.201
I've got my best
agents on the job!

14:29.201 --> 14:31.570

14:31.570 --> 14:32.805
They'll find it!

14:32.805 --> 14:36.308
We've got it, boss.
We've got it!!

14:36.308 --> 14:37.610
Good work, men!

14:37.610 --> 14:41.280
I knew, I could
count on you, Mr. Sneer.

14:41.280 --> 14:44.550
You're a man of your word.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.685
Um.. right.

14:46.685 --> 14:50.055
Lady B-B: Uh, I find,
I'm terribly fatigued

14:50.055 --> 14:52.024
by all this excitement.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.894
Take me home, dearest.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.097
Certainly,
my little posey.

14:58.097 --> 15:02.601
Thanks again, Mr. Sneer,
for everything!

15:04.036 --> 15:06.305
Pig3: It worked.
He didn't even notice!

15:06.305 --> 15:08.507
What are
you talking about?

15:08.507 --> 15:12.244
Pig3: Uhm,
It's a fake, boss.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.580
We just made the gem.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.883
A fake? Oh no!

15:17.883 --> 15:20.886
When Knox finds out,
I'll be ruined!

15:20.886 --> 15:21.887
Aaaaah!

15:23.355 --> 15:23.889
I'll bet you'd like to

15:23.889 --> 15:25.190
I'll bet you'd like
to see your old buddy,

15:25.190 --> 15:27.326
Bert Raccoon, be a movie star,

15:27.326 --> 15:28.494
wouldn't you, Cedric?

15:28.494 --> 15:30.262
Um, sure, Bert.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.197
Then, why
don't you tell me

15:32.197 --> 15:35.267
where your Pop hid
the Prism of Zenda.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.069
I don't know, Bert.

15:37.069 --> 15:42.007
Oh, c'mon, Cedric.
You can tell..me!

15:42.007 --> 15:43.876
Oops..he, he...

15:43.876 --> 15:45.611
sorry, Cedric, I'll get 'em.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.249
Wait a minute!

15:51.951 --> 15:53.719
That's it, Cedric,

15:53.719 --> 15:56.689
I know where the
Prism of Zenda is hidden!!

15:58.424 --> 16:00.426
I suppose you're all wondering

16:00.426 --> 16:02.494
why I called you here.

16:02.494 --> 16:03.629
Get on with it!

16:03.629 --> 16:07.299
I, Bert Raccoon,
ace detective,

16:07.299 --> 16:10.102
am about to reveal
the whereabouts

16:10.102 --> 16:12.471
of the Prism of Zenda.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.374
We know, we know!
Hurry up!

16:15.374 --> 16:19.945
Triumph is to be
savoured, Mr. Sneer.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.048
Now..let's review the facts.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.416
Do we have to..?

16:24.416 --> 16:25.417
One!!

16:27.419 --> 16:29.922
The gem disappeared in the dark,

16:29.922 --> 16:33.225
but the lights were off
for only a few seconds.

16:33.225 --> 16:35.494
And when the lights
came back on,

16:35.494 --> 16:37.930
the pedestal was still rocking,

16:37.930 --> 16:40.332
as though someone had bumped it.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.401
So it couldn't have gone far.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.804
Two. Everyone has looked

16:45.804 --> 16:48.574
everywhere a gem
could be hidden.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.810
Except one place.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.846
Where? Where?

16:53.846 --> 16:57.783
Cedric, your
spectacles, if you please.

17:00.319 --> 17:04.423
Notice how glass is almost
invisible under water...

17:04.423 --> 17:05.424
So?

17:05.424 --> 17:08.160
The same is
true for crystals...

17:08.160 --> 17:10.496
Crystals, like...

17:10.496 --> 17:13.832
The Prism of Zenda!!!!

17:13.832 --> 17:15.000
Melissa/Schaeffer: Oh!

17:17.302 --> 17:18.704
The contest is over!

17:18.704 --> 17:20.839
Everybody, get out of my house!

17:20.839 --> 17:25.144
Hey!! What about my
starring role in your movie?

17:25.144 --> 17:26.278
The movie's off!

17:26.278 --> 17:30.315
I never want to hear about
the Prism of Zenda again!

17:31.116 --> 17:33.819
I'm sorry, Bert.
I thought you were brilliant!

17:33.819 --> 17:35.788
You deserve the
part in the movie.

17:37.356 --> 17:40.392
Oh well.
Easy come, easy go.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.762
But mark my words, Ralph,
one of these days...

17:43.762 --> 17:46.031
One of these days,

17:46.031 --> 17:48.400
Bert Raccoon's gonna be

17:48.400 --> 17:50.002
a staaaaar!!

17:51.203 --> 17:51.703
I can't believe that

17:51.703 --> 17:54.339
I can't believe
that ring-tailed reject

17:54.339 --> 17:55.741
actually found it.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.876
Pig1: Any way, now
you can tell Mr. Knox

17:57.876 --> 18:00.145
you've got the real prism.

18:00.145 --> 18:02.414
Are you out of your
microscopic mind?

18:02.414 --> 18:05.484
If I tell him I gave him a fake,

18:05.484 --> 18:07.319
he'll never trust me again.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.855
Pig2: Well, what are
you going to do, boss?

18:09.855 --> 18:13.258
We are
going to put it back,

18:13.258 --> 18:15.327
and Knox won't know
a thing about it.

18:16.829 --> 18:20.065
Pig3: Isn't breaking and
entering illegal, boss?

18:20.065 --> 18:21.767
Of course it's illegal!

18:21.767 --> 18:23.869
But Knox'll never find out.

18:23.869 --> 18:25.237

18:44.256 --> 18:46.692

Pig2: The gate was open.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.801
Be careful.

18:55.801 --> 18:58.270
There are pressure
pads on the floor.

18:58.270 --> 19:01.607
If we step on them,
the alarm goes off.

19:14.653 --> 19:16.555
Those are laser beams.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.825
Touch one of those and you're
going to be roast pork.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.431
Uh!..Oh!

19:27.432 --> 19:31.170
If you break any of those
beams and the alarm goes off,

19:31.170 --> 19:34.573
our great-grandchildren
will be visitng us in prison.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.845
Ha-haa! Now let's
get out of here

19:39.845 --> 19:41.580
before we wear out our welcome.

Pig1: A..a..a..choo!

19:45.484 --> 19:47.853
Quiet!!
Pig1: Sorry, boss.

19:56.061 --> 19:57.095
Now you've done it you

19:57.095 --> 19:58.997
brainless excuse for a burglar!

20:01.700 --> 20:03.335
Evening, Knox.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.370
What's the meaning
of this, Mr. Sneer?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.606
It's not what
it looks like, Knox.

20:07.606 --> 20:11.210
Lady B-B: Oooo.
He's got the Prism of Zenda.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.945
No, you don't understand.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.514
I was returning the real prism.

20:15.514 --> 20:17.849
It-it's down on the pedestal.

20:17.849 --> 20:21.954
You've already
returned it once, Sir!

20:21.954 --> 20:24.022
I gave you a fake, Knox.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.958
The real prism was lost.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.527
I didn't want to tell you,
so I gave you a fake.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.962
But you see,

20:29.962 --> 20:32.564
I gave you a fake!

20:32.564 --> 20:36.201
You don't think
I would have trusted you

20:36.201 --> 20:39.137
with the real
Prism of Zenda, do you?

20:39.137 --> 20:41.373
Huh! The real one

20:41.373 --> 20:44.710
was right here all the time.

20:44.710 --> 20:48.647
I mean, after all,
it is priceless.

20:48.647 --> 20:52.417
You mean...
I had a fake all along?

20:52.417 --> 20:56.054
That..is the real prism,

20:56.054 --> 21:00.993
and you've been caught
red-handed stealing it, Sir.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.728
Oh no!!!

21:04.896 --> 21:06.298

Cyril Sneer in jail
for jewel theft?

21:09.701 --> 21:12.537
Pop claims it
was all a misunderstanding.

21:12.537 --> 21:13.772
If he'd told the truth

21:13.772 --> 21:16.541
about losing the Prism
of Zenda in the first place,

21:16.541 --> 21:18.210
he wouldn't be in jail now.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.945
I know, I know.

21:19.945 --> 21:22.281
Aren't you worried
about him, Cedric?

21:22.281 --> 21:25.350
Not really.
I talked to Mr. Knox

21:25.350 --> 21:28.020
and I'm sure Pop'll be
out in a few days.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.922
As soon as the story
gets straightened out.

21:30.922 --> 21:34.259
Besides, Pop's been
working so hard lately,

21:34.259 --> 21:36.461
I think the rest
will do him good.
