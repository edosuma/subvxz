01:19.162 --> 01:20.747
<i>Think of your favorite film.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:23.958
<i>Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.</i>
<i>Just think of the title.</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:26.461
<i>For me, it's </i>Lawrence of Arabia.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.338
<i>I love getting lost in it.</i>

01:28.421 --> 01:31.758
<i>It's the biggest movie, and I love</i>
<i>seeing it on the biggest screen.</i>

01:31.841 --> 01:33.343
<i>Forget virtual reality.</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:36.679
<i>That's the hit that I'm chasing</i>
<i>every single time I'm in the theater.</i>

01:36.763 --> 01:38.681


01:44.020 --> 01:46.314
<i>My favorite film has changed</i>
<i>over the years.</i>

01:46.397 --> 01:47.857
<i>I get excited about new things,</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:50.068
<i>and sometimes old discoveries</i>
<i>grow over time.</i>

01:50.568 --> 01:52.195
<i>It always comes back to </i>Lawrence<i>, though.</i>

01:52.278 --> 01:55.782
<i>And part of the reason why is</i>
<i>the lead character, T.E. Lawrence.</i>

01:55.865 --> 01:59.911
<i>He was a real person, of course,</i>
<i>but in the hands of director David Lean</i>

01:59.994 --> 02:03.706
<i>and screenwriter Robert Bolt, he's also</i>
<i>a much-larger-than-life film character,</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:06.000
<i>played by Peter O'Toole</i>
<i>to such remarkable effect</i>

02:06.084 --> 02:09.254
<i>that the first-time film star</i>
<i>got nominated for Best Actor.</i>

02:09.337 --> 02:10.880
I know I'm not ordinary.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.216
-That's not what I'm saying.
All right.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.509
I'm extraordinary.

02:17.011 --> 02:18.138
What of it?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.684
<i>The T.E. Lawrence in the film</i>
<i>is a man of vision.</i>

02:22.767 --> 02:25.270
<i>He finds himself</i>
<i>at a crucial time and place in history,</i>

02:25.353 --> 02:27.605
<i>both smart enough</i>
<i>and stupid enough to believe</i>

02:27.689 --> 02:29.691
<i>that he can change that time and place.</i>

02:29.774 --> 02:31.776
<i>That combination</i>
<i>is what it takes sometimes.</i>

02:31.860 --> 02:34.154
<i>And sure enough, he does change history.</i>

02:34.237 --> 02:38.074
<i>And in turn, history changes him</i>
<i>and not necessarily for the better.</i>

02:40.326 --> 02:43.913
<i>There is darkness in the character</i>
<i>and monstrous weakness at times.</i>

02:43.997 --> 02:47.917
<i>He's painfully human, and that is part</i>
<i>of what I find so compelling about him.</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:50.211
I killed two people.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.630
One was a boy.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.465
I led him into a quicksand.

02:55.049 --> 02:59.304
The other was a man.
I had to execute him with my pistol.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.100
There was something about it
I didn't like.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.019
Well, naturally.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.937
No. Something else.

03:09.939 --> 03:10.940
I enjoyed it.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.485
<i>I think T.E. Lawrence</i>
<i>is one of the most interesting,</i>

03:14.569 --> 03:18.239
<i>complicated, frustrating,</i>
<i>and recognizably flawed characters</i>

03:18.323 --> 03:19.699
<i>I've ever seen in a film.</i>

03:20.742 --> 03:21.826
<i>But I don't like him.</i>

03:22.744 --> 03:26.539
No prisoners! No prisoners!

03:28.416 --> 03:31.294
<i>I admire him. I think</i>
<i>he was great by many metrics,</i>

03:31.377 --> 03:34.589
<i>but I wrestle with the idea</i>
<i>that I like him in any conventional sense,</i>

03:34.672 --> 03:37.050
<i>and that's part of what</i>
<i>keeps me coming back.</i>

03:37.634 --> 03:40.011
<i>It's one of the most slippery ingredients</i>
<i>in filmmaking.</i>

03:40.094 --> 03:41.554
<i>How do you define likability?</i>

03:41.638 --> 03:45.225
<i>How do you quantify it in a way</i>
<i>that you can reliably reproduce?</i>

03:45.308 --> 03:48.978
<i>And so what? If I don't like T.E. Lawrence</i>
<i>as a character, does that even matter?</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:51.231
<i>We're going to argue</i>
<i>that drama has very little to do</i>

03:51.314 --> 03:53.358
<i>with what we like</i>
<i>or what makes us comfortable,</i>

03:53.441 --> 03:55.318
<i>and that's part of the purpose of drama.</i>

03:56.027 --> 03:58.821
<i>Storytelling cannot start</i>
<i>at "happily ever after."</i>

03:58.905 --> 04:01.741
<i>And art is not just hanging out</i>
<i>with your friends on the couch.</i>

04:01.824 --> 04:05.745
<i>Art's where we confront the things</i>
<i>that terrify or upset or traumatize us.</i>

04:05.828 --> 04:09.082
<i>It's not just okay to tell stories</i>
<i>about characters we don't like.</i>

04:09.165 --> 04:10.124
<i>It's crucial.</i>

04:12.710 --> 04:15.505
-What's your name, fat-body?
-Leonard Lawrence, sir.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.340
Lawrence? Lawrence what? Of Arabia?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.341
Sir, no, sir!

04:18.424 --> 04:19.842
I don't like the name Lawrence.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.178
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.930
I don't like your kind of people.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.266
Like you?
Who the hell said I got to like you?

04:26.349 --> 04:29.060
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>your likability is at 26%.</i>

04:29.143 --> 04:31.604
Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability…

04:31.688 --> 04:32.772
Likability.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.440
God, you are a piece of work.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.025
Fuck you!

04:36.109 --> 04:37.485


04:37.568 --> 04:38.695
You're a funny guy.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.322
I'm funny how? I mean, funny
like I'm clown? I amuse you?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.659
I don't like your jerk-off name.
I don't like your jerk-off face.

04:44.742 --> 04:49.205
I don't like your jerk-off behavior.
And I don't like you, jerk-off.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.457
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

04:53.042 --> 04:53.876
Ow!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.921
<i>As a critic,</i>
<i>I am constantly challenging myself</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.464
<i>about why I love the things I do,</i>

04:58.548 --> 05:01.384
<i>why I'm drawn to the films</i>
<i>I find most compelling.</i>

05:01.467 --> 05:03.011
<i>There are times I am unsettled</i>

05:03.094 --> 05:05.096
<i>by the feelings I have</i>
<i>about characters in movies.</i>

05:05.179 --> 05:07.390
<i>And I love trying to unpack why that is.</i>

05:07.473 --> 05:11.269
<i>I wanna be challenged by characters.</i>
<i>I want to feel strongly about them.</i>

05:11.352 --> 05:14.397
<i>But I don't have</i>
<i>an overall need to like all of them.</i>

05:15.189 --> 05:18.192
<i>Art is not an endorsement.</i>
<i>It's an exploration.</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:20.653
<i>Some of the best art,</i>
<i>even in mainstream pop culture,</i>

05:20.737 --> 05:22.864
<i>takes us to some very dark places.</i>

05:24.449 --> 05:25.825
I'm finished.

05:25.908 --> 05:28.619
<i> One of the very first monsters</i>
<i>I ever found myself drawn to</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:31.039
<i>while I sat there in the dark</i>
<i>was Michael Corleone.</i>

05:31.122 --> 05:36.002
Don't be afraid, Carlo. Come on,
you think I'd make my sister a widow?

05:36.085 --> 05:38.588
<i>As an adult,</i>
<i>I don't like Michael Corleone.</i>

05:38.671 --> 05:41.466
<i>But I understand</i>
<i>why I felt myself drawn to him.</i>

05:41.549 --> 05:44.177
<i>He might be one of the richest characters</i>
<i>in American film.</i>

05:44.260 --> 05:45.428
<i>The first two </i>Godfather <i>films,</i>

05:45.511 --> 05:48.222
<i>which have to be considered</i>
<i>foundational, classic cinema,</i>

05:48.306 --> 05:51.184
<i>tell the story</i>
<i>of how a good man slowly compromises</i>

05:51.267 --> 05:53.311
<i>everything that matters</i>
<i>to him for his family</i>

05:53.394 --> 05:56.314
<i>in order to become</i>
<i>a powerful murderer and thief.</i>

06:06.032 --> 06:07.075
<i>It's the death of decency.</i>

06:11.079 --> 06:12.246
<i>By the end of the second film,</i>

06:12.330 --> 06:15.083
<i>he's as dark and ruined a figure</i>
<i>as I can imagine.</i>

06:15.166 --> 06:16.918
<i>He ends up unlikable to an extreme,</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:21.589
<i>but I understand every step he takes</i>
<i>on that long slide into oblivion.</i>

06:21.672 --> 06:25.301
Do you expect me to let you
take my children from me?

06:26.260 --> 06:27.470
Don't you know me?

06:27.553 --> 06:29.722
Don't you know
that that's an impossibility,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.599
that that could never happen?

06:31.682 --> 06:35.395
That I'd use all my power to keep
something like that from happening?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.855
<i>Michael begins the film</i>
<i>as the Corleone who got out.</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:40.441
<i>He's the immigrant's</i>
<i>American dream incarnate.</i>

06:40.525 --> 06:44.153
<i>The child who's more successful,</i>
<i>more integrated, more American.</i>

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.867
You don't come to Las Vegas and talk
to a man like Moe Green like that!

06:49.951 --> 06:53.037
Fredo, you're my older brother,
and I love you.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.708
But don't ever take sides
with anyone against the family again.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.253
<i>By the end of the film,</i>
<i>Michael's fall seems complete,</i>

07:00.336 --> 07:02.880
<i>culminating in one</i>
<i>of the most emotionally brutal</i>

07:02.964 --> 07:04.882
<i>but simple images possible,</i>

07:04.966 --> 07:07.593
<i>to close the door on everything</i>
<i>that made him decent.</i>

07:11.973 --> 07:14.392
<i>It's the second film</i>
<i>where Coppola and his collaborators</i>

07:14.475 --> 07:16.978
<i>tested the boundaries</i>
<i>of what we'll accept from a lead.</i>

07:17.061 --> 07:18.104
I'll talk to Fredo.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.941
<i>John Cazale's Fredo is a rat,</i>
<i>a piece of garbage who betrays his family,</i>

07:22.024 --> 07:24.944
<i>but he's also driven</i>
<i>by a twisted desire to be accepted</i>

07:25.027 --> 07:27.155
<i>and loved in the same ways</i>
<i>as his brothers.</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:30.199
I'm your older brother, Mike,
and I was stepped over!

07:30.283 --> 07:33.661
-That's the way Pop wanted it.
-It ain't the way Iwanted it!

07:35.204 --> 07:37.331
I can handle things! I'm smart!

07:37.832 --> 07:40.877
Not like everybody says, like dumb!

07:40.960 --> 07:43.171
I'm smart, and I want respect!

07:43.254 --> 07:46.716
<i>Michael's fury at being betrayed</i>
<i>by Fredo is understandable,</i>

07:46.799 --> 07:48.759
<i>especially in a film</i>
<i>that is as focused on the idea</i>

07:48.843 --> 07:50.553
<i>of family as the center of the world</i>

07:50.636 --> 07:53.097
<i>and honor as the thing</i>
<i>that drives every choice.</i>

07:53.181 --> 07:55.725
<i>By the time Michael gives Fredo</i>
<i>the literal kiss of death</i>

07:55.808 --> 07:57.477
<i>in the film's most powerful moment,</i>

07:57.560 --> 08:01.314
<i>neither one of the characters is defined</i>
<i>in any way by whether we like them.</i>

08:01.397 --> 08:03.191
I know it was you, Fredo.

08:03.941 --> 08:04.984
You broke my heart.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.279
You broke my heart.

08:09.113 --> 08:12.408
Take it, you dirty, yellow-bellied rat,
or I'll give it to you through the door.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.493
Listen, handsome. Open up.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.203
Well, he's getting too big.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.121
Yeah, well, he won't get any bigger.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.790
Yeah, this is what I get
for liking a guy too much.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.292
You found someone you like better.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.880
You might as well come down, Jarrett.
There's no one left but you.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.174
Here's my answer, you dirty--

08:28.257 --> 08:29.759


08:30.885 --> 08:32.887
Get out of my way, Johnny. I'm gonna spit.

08:34.722 --> 08:38.226
<i>America has always been</i>
<i>positively dizzy for criminals on film.</i>

08:38.309 --> 08:40.353
<i>From our earliest films to the silent era</i>

08:40.436 --> 08:43.231
<i>and straight in to the first blast</i>
<i>of studio talkies,</i>

08:43.314 --> 08:44.941
<i>gangsters were big business.</i>

08:45.024 --> 08:46.734
I ain't so tough.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.904
<i> When the Depression hit,</i>
<i>there was a Robin Hood romanticism</i>

08:49.987 --> 08:51.197
<i>to them on screen,</i>

08:51.280 --> 08:53.741
<i>and America seemed obsessed</i>
<i>with real criminals in the streets,</i>

08:53.824 --> 08:56.118
<i>with the press often treating them</i>
<i>like rock stars.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:58.246
<i>Makes sense that a generation later,</i>
<i>they would make</i>

08:58.329 --> 09:01.082
<i>genuinely rebellious movies</i>
<i>about those same criminals.</i>

09:01.165 --> 09:04.585
Hey, boy, what you doing
with my mama's car?

09:05.127 --> 09:08.297
<i>By the time we got</i>
<i>into the newly explicit visual language</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:10.550
<i>of </i>Bonnie and Clyde,
<i>it may have felt brand-new,</i>

09:10.633 --> 09:12.301
<i>but it was part of a cycle</i>
<i>where we grapple</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:15.263
<i>with our love of transgression</i>
<i>by destroying the characters we love</i>

09:15.346 --> 09:17.807
<i>precisely because they transgress</i>
<i>in ways we can't.</i>

09:17.890 --> 09:19.392
Hold it, hold it!

09:19.475 --> 09:20.685
Hey.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.007
Bonnie and Clyde <i>was</i>
<i>a point on a larger continuum,</i>

09:51.090 --> 09:55.595
<i>a sort of perpetually doomed collision</i>
<i>between lovers on a one-way ride to hell.</i>

09:56.304 --> 09:59.473
<i>These characters may seem like they love</i>
<i>each other or they're driven by desire,</i>

09:59.557 --> 10:01.892
<i>but the truth is</i>
<i>that death is what really drives them.</i>

10:01.976 --> 10:03.894
So you go on home,
and you sit in your room,

10:03.978 --> 10:09.900
and you think, "Now, when and how
am I ever gonna get away from this?"

10:13.237 --> 10:14.405
And now you know.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.868
<i>And some of our greatest cinema</i>
<i>challenges the things we like or love,</i>

10:18.951 --> 10:21.287
<i>daring us to really confront</i>
<i>our own hearts</i>

10:21.370 --> 10:23.331
<i>in the safety of that darkened theater.</i>

10:23.414 --> 10:26.917
<i>With </i>The Godfather,<i> Coppola was interested</i>
<i>in looking at the real moral cost</i>

10:27.001 --> 10:29.962
<i>of that powerful fantasy,</i>
<i>and he attached a price tag</i>

10:30.046 --> 10:32.506
<i>to a life of crime</i>
<i>that seemed too high to pay.</i>

10:32.590 --> 10:35.885
<i>The last thing he cared about</i>
<i>was making you like Michael,</i>

10:35.968 --> 10:38.387
<i>and it's the last thing</i>
<i>Michael cares about as well.</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:46.896


10:51.525 --> 10:54.028
<i>Maybe the greatest thing</i>
<i>about the wave of filmmaking</i>

10:54.111 --> 10:57.156
<i>that hit the American mainstream</i>
<i>like a tidal wave in the late 1960s</i>

10:57.239 --> 11:01.285
<i>and early 1970s was the way</i>
<i>filmmakers seemed determined to bring us</i>

11:01.369 --> 11:02.828
<i>a brand-new kind of protagonist,</i>

11:02.912 --> 11:05.498
<i>as they explored</i>
<i>the ugliest corners of human nature.</i>

11:05.581 --> 11:07.500
I gave you the prize years ago, Martha.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.670
There isn't an abomination award going
that you haven't won.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.923
I swear, if you existed, I'd divorce you.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.926
<i>Is there anyone alive who watched</i>
Who'sAfraid of Virginia Woolf?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.887
<i>and thought, "Wow, I would really like</i>
<i>to have them over for dinner."</i>

11:19.970 --> 11:23.140
You still look like you have
a pretty good body now too. Is that right?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.850
Martha, decency forbid--

11:24.934 --> 11:25.768
Shut up.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.479
Yes, he has a very firm body.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.064
Have you?

11:30.147 --> 11:31.732
<i>The movie's wildly entertaining,</i>

11:31.816 --> 11:34.151
<i>and with films like that,</i>
<i>it often leads audiences</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:37.613
<i>to wonder if there's something wrong</i>
<i>with the filmmaker or, even worse,</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:38.698
<i>wrong with them.</i>

11:39.240 --> 11:41.450
<i>How can you watch a film</i>
<i>about someone so awful,</i>

11:41.534 --> 11:44.662
<i>so morally bankrupt</i>
<i>and have such a good time?</i>

11:44.745 --> 11:47.039
Be careful, Martha.
I'll rip you to pieces.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.668
You are not man enough.
You haven't the guts!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.336
<i>It's because filmmakers can put us</i>

11:52.420 --> 11:54.130
<i>in the skin of people</i>
<i>who do terrible things,</i>

11:54.213 --> 11:57.508
<i>and they can make us feel like</i>
<i>we might cross those same lines.</i>

11:57.591 --> 11:59.260
<i>They can even give us permission to do so</i>

11:59.343 --> 12:01.387
<i>with that safe remove</i>
<i>of "it's just a movie."</i>

12:01.470 --> 12:06.267
<i>Are you behind on your credit card bills?</i>
<i>Good! Pick up the phone and start dialing.</i>

12:06.350 --> 12:09.937
I want you to deal with
your problems by becoming rich!

12:10.020 --> 12:10.938
Yeah!

12:11.021 --> 12:13.232
<i>If there's</i>
<i>any major American filmmaker</i>

12:13.315 --> 12:15.693
<i>whose body of work</i>
<i>challenges the entire idea</i>

12:15.776 --> 12:18.738
<i>that we have to like our lead characters,</i>
<i>it's Martin Scorsese.</i>

12:18.821 --> 12:22.366
<i>He has built his long and storied career</i>
<i>on films about people who are driven</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:24.034
<i>by passions that consume them.</i>

12:24.118 --> 12:25.786
<i>And he's never seemed terribly concerned</i>

12:25.870 --> 12:27.872
<i>with whether or not we like</i>
<i>his lead characters.</i>

12:28.914 --> 12:31.333
-You botherin' me about a steak, huh?
-That's great!

12:31.417 --> 12:32.626
You botherin' me about a steak?

12:32.710 --> 12:36.422
<i>In 1980's </i>Raging Bull,
<i>Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro,</i>

12:36.505 --> 12:38.674
<i>is barely functional as a person.</i>

12:38.758 --> 12:40.342
<i>And part of what compels us to watch</i>

12:40.426 --> 12:42.511
<i>is the magic trick</i>
<i>of his physical transformation</i>

12:42.595 --> 12:44.513
<i>between the first half of the film</i>
<i>and the second.</i>

12:44.597 --> 12:47.850
I coulda had class.
I coulda been a contender.

12:47.933 --> 12:52.646
I coulda been somebody
instead of a bum, which is what I am.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.648
<i>LaMotta drives</i>

12:54.732 --> 12:57.318
<i>LaMotta is only alive</i>

<i>He has a raw, brute gift for it.</i>
<i>And he's rewarded for it.</i>

13:00.821 --> 13:01.864
You fuck my wife?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.741
How could you ask me a question like that?

13:03.824 --> 13:06.994
Why don't you tell me, huh?
Did you fuck my brother? Huh?

13:07.077 --> 13:08.788
-Get off me, you fat pig!

13:08.871 --> 13:10.206
<i>There's no kindness in him,</i>

<i>flailing in the dark.</i>

13:21.467 --> 13:23.260
Oh, you motherfuck--

13:29.058 --> 13:30.768
<i>There is beauty in Scorsese's film,</i>

13:30.851 --> 13:33.145
<i>and there's</i>
<i>even dark, horrible humor to it,</i>

13:33.229 --> 13:35.356
<i>but there's nothing</i>
<i>that even remotely indicates</i>

13:35.439 --> 13:37.483
<i>we're supposed to like Jake LaMotta.</i>

13:37.566 --> 13:40.236
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's coming back to me.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.656
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.867
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Rupert Pupkin.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.911
Now, I know the name
doesn't mean very much to you,

13:48.994 --> 13:50.412
but it means an awful lot to me.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.248
That's "Rupert Pupkin."

13:52.331 --> 13:54.083
Pupkin. P-U-P-K-I-N.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.168
People often misspell it
and mispronounce it.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.796
-What is your real name?
-That's my real name. Rupert Pupkin.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.799
<i> Their next collaboration,</i>
King of Comedy, <i>was a movie</i>

14:01.882 --> 14:04.802
<i>that predicted the way celebrity culture</i>
<i>in America would metastasize.</i>

14:04.885 --> 14:08.597
Let's do something crazy tonight.
I wanna be crazy! I wanna be nuts!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.975
A lot of you
are probably wondering

14:11.058 --> 14:12.893
why Jerry isn't with us tonight.

14:12.977 --> 14:13.978
Well, I'll tell you.

14:14.061 --> 14:16.939
The fact is, he's tied up.
And I'm the one who tied him.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.109
<i> It was clear that Scorsese cared</i>
<i>as little about whether we liked Rupert</i>

14:20.192 --> 14:23.112
<i>as he cared about whether we liked</i>
<i>the victim of his attentions.</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:25.447
I had this conversation in my head.
This is beautiful.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.200
-Did it always turn out this way?
-Yeah, it did. And--

14:28.284 --> 14:29.743
<i>Jerry Lewis played a character</i>

14:29.827 --> 14:32.162
<i>that took the most acidic rumors</i>
<i>about Johnny Carson,</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:35.124
<i>ran them through the ugly truth</i>
<i>about Jerry Lewis,</i>

14:35.207 --> 14:37.084
<i>and came up with something</i>
<i>so intensely unlikable</i>

14:37.167 --> 14:38.752
<i>that it almost feels like a dare.</i>

14:38.836 --> 14:40.379
You gonna open the goddamn door?

14:40.462 --> 14:41.380
Mr. Langford.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.757
-Standing out there eight minutes.
-Sorry, sir.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.760
-I told you to call to get rid of you!
-Yeah, all right, I made a mistake.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.304
So did Hitler!

14:48.387 --> 14:51.140
So what's got into you?
I'm breakin' your balls a little bit.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.350
Now go home
and get your fucking shine box.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.060
-Motherfuckin' mutt!

14:55.144 --> 14:57.521
You… you fuckin' piece of shit!

14:58.147 --> 14:59.064
Get the door.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.986
<i>One of the biggest movies</i>
<i>in Scorsese's career</i>

15:04.069 --> 15:06.530
<i>came in the early '90s with</i> Goodfellas.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.449
<i>Based on the true story of Henry Hill,</i>

15:08.532 --> 15:11.327
<i>a lifelong mobster</i>
<i>who rolled over on his fellow criminals</i>

15:11.410 --> 15:12.786
<i>when he was finally caught,</i>

15:12.870 --> 15:17.082
<i>it is a powerfully made movie, seductive,</i>
<i>and there is a charisma to the way</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:19.960
<i>he presents this world</i>
<i>of scumbags and murderers.</i>

15:20.044 --> 15:22.713
<i>For us,</i>
<i>to live any other way was nuts.</i>

15:22.796 --> 15:25.132
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

15:25.215 --> 15:26.759
<i>If anyone complained twice,</i>

15:26.842 --> 15:29.762
<i>they got hit so bad, believe me,</i>
<i>they never complained again.</i>

15:29.845 --> 15:32.932
<i>Even as we watch these</i>
<i>career pieces of shit eat one another…</i>

15:33.515 --> 15:34.516
Oh no--

15:35.851 --> 15:38.687
<i> …Scorsese makes us feel</i>
<i>the same pull that Henry Hill felt,</i>

15:38.771 --> 15:39.605
<i>the same pull</i>

15:39.688 --> 15:41.774
<i>that so many other filmmakers</i>
<i>have indulged.</i>

15:42.358 --> 15:45.152
<i>Scorsese knows that he doesn't have</i>
<i>anything to worry about</i>

15:45.235 --> 15:48.280
<i>in terms of whether we like</i>
<i>his characters in </i>Goodfellas<i>,</i>

15:48.364 --> 15:51.533
<i>because he knows we'll be riveted</i>
<i>by the vicarious details of this life</i>

15:51.617 --> 15:53.535
<i>that we'll never experience for ourselves.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:55.829
-It's gonna be a good summer.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.963
<i> If there's any film of Scorsese's</i>
<i>that best exemplifies</i>

16:04.046 --> 16:06.715
<i>how little it matters</i>
<i>that we like the lead in a film,</i>

16:06.799 --> 16:09.259
<i>it is his early masterpiece </i>Taxi Driver<i>,</i>

16:09.343 --> 16:13.180
<i>a piercing study of what leads</i>
<i>a lonely man on the margins of society</i>

16:13.263 --> 16:15.265
<i>to commit an act of overheated violence.</i>

16:16.141 --> 16:18.185
<i>All the animals come out at night.</i>

16:19.144 --> 16:23.983
<i>Whores, skunk pussies, buggers,</i>
<i>queens, fairies, dopers, junkies.</i>

16:25.526 --> 16:27.069
<i>Sick, venal.</i>

16:28.028 --> 16:31.532
<i>Someday a real rain'll come</i>
<i>and wash all the scum off the streets.</i>

16:32.199 --> 16:34.451
<i>Travis Bickle is so socially bent</i>

16:34.535 --> 16:37.246
<i>that his idea of a first date</i>
<i>with campaign worker Betsy,</i>

16:37.329 --> 16:38.706
<i>played by Cybill Shepherd,</i>

16:38.789 --> 16:41.208
<i>is to take her to a porn theater</i>
<i>in Times Square.</i>

16:41.792 --> 16:42.876
You gotta be kidding.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.294
What?

16:44.378 --> 16:45.838
This is a dirty movie.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.590
<i>He starts the film damaged,</i>
<i>and little by little,</i>

16:48.674 --> 16:51.802
<i>we watch as his tenuous relationship</i>
<i>with reality slips away.</i>

16:52.386 --> 16:54.805
<i>He becomes focused</i>
<i>on a teenage prostitute next,</i>

16:54.888 --> 16:56.390
<i>but she's uninterested in being saved,</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:58.892
<i>and nothing she says or does</i>
<i>makes any sense to him.</i>

16:58.976 --> 17:01.603
I'm square?
You're the one that's square, man.

17:01.687 --> 17:05.149
I don't go screw and fuck with a bunch
of killers and junkies the way you do.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.359
You call that being hip?

17:08.986 --> 17:10.320
What world you from?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.239
<i>Bickle retreats into a fantasy</i>

17:12.322 --> 17:14.950
<i>in which he sees a way to become</i>
<i>powerful through violence.</i>

17:15.034 --> 17:18.078
<i>Whether focused on the political candidate</i>
<i>of the woman he wants</i>

17:18.162 --> 17:20.372
<i>or on the pimp of the girl</i>
<i>he wants to save,</i>

17:20.456 --> 17:23.208
<i>the violence is simply a way</i>
<i>of giving Travis a voice in the world,</i>

17:23.292 --> 17:27.046
<i>a chance for him to write his name</i>
<i>large enough for everyone to finally see.</i>

17:27.129 --> 17:29.798
<i>Listen, you fuckers,</i>
<i>you screwheads,</i>

17:29.882 --> 17:34.970
<i>here is a man who would not take it</i>
<i>anymore,</i> <i>who would not let--</i>

17:35.054 --> 17:37.806
<i>Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads,</i>

17:38.432 --> 17:41.769
<i>here is a man</i>
<i>who would not take it anymore,</i>

17:41.852 --> 17:46.523
<i>a man who stood up against the scum,</i>
<i>the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit.</i>

17:46.607 --> 17:48.400
<i>Here is someone who stood up.</i>

17:49.068 --> 17:50.903
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>about Travis that I like</i>

17:50.986 --> 17:54.656
<i>and nothing I feel like I'm supposed</i>
<i>to like, but I do feel for him,</i>

17:55.199 --> 17:59.286
<i>because Martin Scorsese and Paul Schrader</i>
<i>dare to slip so fully into his skin.</i>

18:00.287 --> 18:03.207
<i>The film builds to what any other movie</i>
<i>would offer up as a heroic ending,</i>

18:03.290 --> 18:06.794
<i>when all we're really watching</i>
<i>is a crazy loner murdering a pimp</i>

18:06.877 --> 18:09.213
<i>because of some strange,</i>
<i>possessive fantasy he had</i>

18:09.296 --> 18:10.672
<i>about an underage sex worker.</i>

18:11.381 --> 18:14.009
Get the fuck outta here, man.
Get outta here.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.719
Suck on this.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.638
-Ooh, ooh!
-Hey!

18:33.779 --> 18:35.531
Don't shoot him!

18:37.741 --> 18:39.743
<i>He's a violent man</i>
<i>in a seedy world,</i>

18:39.827 --> 18:42.538
<i>and the only reason he ends</i>
<i>the film driving his cab again</i>

18:42.621 --> 18:44.581
<i>is because he killed the right person.</i>

18:44.665 --> 18:48.252
<i>It's a hell of a message at what felt</i>
<i>like a culturally volatile moment.</i>

18:48.836 --> 18:50.963
<i>Clearly there is hunger</i>
<i>from some audiences</i>

18:51.046 --> 18:54.591
<i>for stories about characters</i>
<i>who are inspirational or aspirational,</i>

18:54.675 --> 18:57.761
<i>and fiction can easily become a way</i>
<i>to try on a life you wish you could live</i>

18:57.845 --> 19:00.639
<i>or one you wish you were strong enough</i>
<i>or good enough to live.</i>

19:00.722 --> 19:03.433
<i>But we're often drawn to stories</i>
<i>of darkness or dysfunction</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:06.019
<i>precisely because we want</i>
<i>to understand these people</i>

19:06.103 --> 19:07.896
<i>who seem so broken or wrong to us.</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:10.816
<i>The real question we're asking is this,</i>

19:10.899 --> 19:13.360
<i>should you try to make</i>
<i>every character likable?</i>

19:13.443 --> 19:15.529
<i>Would it fix every film to do so?</i>

19:15.612 --> 19:18.031
<i>You may think we're exaggerating,</i>
<i>but look at what happens</i>

19:18.115 --> 19:20.117
<i>when you flatten out</i>
<i>an interesting character</i>

19:20.200 --> 19:21.994
<i>because you're afraid</i>
<i>he's not likable enough.</i>

19:22.077 --> 19:25.831
<i>Tom Wolfe's </i>The Bonfire of the Vanities
<i>was a scathing satire.</i>

19:25.914 --> 19:29.334
<i>And in the novel, Sherman McCoy is</i>
<i>a self-anointed master of the universe,</i>

19:29.418 --> 19:33.505
<i>a Wall Street banker who's supposed to be</i>
<i>emblematic of an entire class of Americans</i>

19:33.589 --> 19:35.007
<i>who Wolfe observed.</i>

19:35.090 --> 19:38.468
<i>The moneyed, upper-class assholes</i>
<i>who pass money and influence down</i>

19:38.552 --> 19:40.053
<i>from generation to generation.</i>

19:40.137 --> 19:42.848
Let's not lose our composure
over a few hundred million dollars.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.141
-Back up.
-I am!

19:44.224 --> 19:47.311
<i>Sherman McCoy is in a car</i>
<i>with his mistress when they panic</i>

19:47.394 --> 19:49.771
<i>and run over a young Black man,</i>
<i>killing him with their car.</i>

19:50.939 --> 19:53.901
<i>It's a pretty insurmountable obstacle</i>
<i>when it comes to liking someone or not.</i>

19:53.984 --> 19:56.778
How? They don't have the full number.
They don't have a witness.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.615
<i>The movie committed</i>
<i>many of the worst sins of adaptation.</i>

19:59.698 --> 20:03.994
<i>Dropping subplots, botching tone,</i>
<i>playing satire straight by mistake.</i>

20:04.077 --> 20:06.663
<i>But by far, the biggest misstep came</i>
<i>at the casting stage.</i>

20:06.747 --> 20:11.835
<i>It seems insane to cast Tom Hanks</i>
<i>as a blond, Waspy, old-money monster,</i>

20:11.919 --> 20:14.254
<i>but there was a reason</i>
<i>the studio insisted.</i>

20:14.338 --> 20:16.506
<i>In a film that is about such awful people,</i>

20:16.590 --> 20:19.218
<i>casting Hanks lets you play</i>
<i>both sides against the middle.</i>

20:20.844 --> 20:23.972
I have protected you, Maria.
I have been a gentleman about this.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.059
I have done my best to keep your name
out of the papers. You have to help me.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.728
<i>Bruce Willis plays the narrator</i>
<i>of the book and the movie,</i>

20:29.811 --> 20:33.315
<i>and his identity as a British expat</i>
<i>living off the teat of America,</i>

20:33.398 --> 20:36.068
<i>even as he sent home reports</i>
<i>on how horrible it was,</i>

20:36.151 --> 20:38.612
<i>seemed annihilated</i>
<i>by that casting decision.</i>

20:38.695 --> 20:42.532
<i>Director Brian De Palma seemed determined</i>
<i>to find ways to make these characters</i>

20:42.616 --> 20:45.702
<i>unlikable by design, palatable by casting.</i>

20:46.787 --> 20:49.414
<i>And in the end,</i>
<i>even Hanks couldn't pull it off.</i>

20:49.915 --> 20:52.584
-Answer the question!
-I'm going to jail, aren't I?

20:53.752 --> 20:57.047
<i>When we're sitting in the dark,</i>
<i>wide-open to these characters,</i>

20:57.130 --> 20:59.591
<i>we don't ultimately care about "likable."</i>

20:59.675 --> 21:02.761
<i>We just wanna be interested,</i>
<i>and we want something that feels honest,</i>

21:02.844 --> 21:04.429
<i>something we recognize as real.</i>

21:05.472 --> 21:07.975
<i>I've gotten into the habit of taking</i>
<i>a new person to see </i>Lawrence

<i>every time it plays</i>
<i>in 70 millimeter in Los Angeles,</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:12.938
<i>which is once or twice a year</i>
<i>without fail.</i>

21:13.021 --> 21:13.855
Due west.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.359
<i>Even so, it took a long time for me</i>
<i>to realize that the film is ultimately</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:20.612
<i>about the importance of letting go</i>
<i>of the idea of being liked.</i>

21:21.280 --> 21:22.698
<i>Lawrence needs approval.</i>

21:22.781 --> 21:25.117
<i>He needs to be right.</i>
<i>He needs to be liked.</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:29.121
<i>But he sees that he's in a position to do</i>
<i>something no one else has ever done,</i>

21:29.204 --> 21:31.415
<i>and he sees it as a call to greatness.</i>

21:31.498 --> 21:34.293
<i>In recognizing the importance</i>
<i>of his own actions, he also recognizes</i>

21:34.376 --> 21:36.586
<i>that he can't worry</i>
<i>about what anyone thinks.</i>

21:37.087 --> 21:40.590
<i>He has to harden himself to scorn</i>
<i>and hatred if he's going to be great.</i>

21:40.674 --> 21:42.634
<i>Lawrence knows that he could be loved.</i>

21:42.718 --> 21:45.679
<i>But he knows that there's more</i>
<i>he can do if he's willing to be hated.</i>

21:46.179 --> 21:49.182
<i>T.E. Lawrence only truly becomes</i>
<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>

21:49.266 --> 21:51.435
<i>when he abandons all concern</i>
<i>with being liked.</i>

21:51.518 --> 21:53.270
Well, what's the trick, then?

21:53.353 --> 21:56.857
The trick, William Potter,
is not minding that it hurts.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.693
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>empathy trumps sympathy.</i>

21:59.776 --> 22:02.237
<i>One is earned,</i>
<i>and the other can be manipulated.</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:05.115
<i>If you give your time to a movie,</i>
<i>you have the right to expect</i>

22:05.198 --> 22:08.118
<i>that you will feel something</i>
<i>for the lead character, certainly.</i>

22:08.201 --> 22:10.746
<i>Just remember,</i>
<i>it's okay if you don't like him.</i>

22:11.747 --> 22:12.581
<i>Really.</i>
