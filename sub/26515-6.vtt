<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:22.027 --> 00:25.329
[Becky] <i>Bruce Wayne
was at the circus
the night your parents died.</i>

00:25.362 --> 00:27.431
[Bruce] I want to help you.

00:27.464 --> 00:29.667
He has volunteered
to be your foster parent.

00:29.701 --> 00:33.838
And, Dick, the police,
they believe it may not
have been an accident.

00:33.871 --> 00:35.106
Someone killed my parents?

00:35.140 --> 00:36.942
[Dick] <i>I'm gonna find out
who's running
this freak show.</i>

00:36.975 --> 00:39.444
-I'll come with you.
-I thought
we weren't splitting up.

00:39.476 --> 00:43.527
I'm coming back. I promise.

00:45.950 --> 00:46.984

00:47.018 --> 00:50.420
-[beeping]
-Nap time, kids.

00:50.454 --> 00:51.823
[Dr. Adamson]
Detective Grayson.

00:51.856 --> 00:53.959
Are you Mr. Adamson?
And what do you
want with Rachel?

00:53.991 --> 00:58.991
You found me.
So the Organization
is sending people to kill us.

00:59.130 --> 01:02.066
If you don't give me
some answers--

01:02.098 --> 01:04.902
[pan sizzling]

01:04.935 --> 01:06.885
[Dick groans]

01:10.740 --> 01:14.578
[Jason grunting]

01:14.611 --> 01:18.049
Dick Grayson in the flesh.
Nice to meet you, bro.

01:18.081 --> 01:20.781
I'm the new Robin.

01:33.798 --> 01:37.802
[priest] Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

01:37.835 --> 01:40.605
And He will welcome them
into the Kingdom of Heaven

01:40.638 --> 01:45.638
where they will dwell
in the house
of the Lord forever.

01:45.909 --> 01:48.513
Let us pray.

01:48.546 --> 01:51.382
Oh, God, who did instruct
the hearts of the faithful

01:51.415 --> 01:53.685
by the light
of the Holy Spirit,

01:53.718 --> 01:57.421
grant us in the same spirit
to be truly wise

01:57.454 --> 02:00.490
and ever to rejoice
in his consolation,

02:00.525 --> 02:03.727
through Jesus Christ,
our Lord.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
Amen.

03:15.132 --> 03:17.467
[Clay] They loved you.

03:17.502 --> 03:22.073
And they were proud of you.

03:22.105 --> 03:25.256
You know that, right?

03:31.282 --> 03:34.352
The police said
someone killed them.

03:34.384 --> 03:37.921
Someone burned
the trapeze ropes

03:37.955 --> 03:41.192
with hydrofluoric acid...

03:41.224 --> 03:43.860
[sighs]

03:43.894 --> 03:45.931
And disappeared.

03:45.963 --> 03:48.967
And the police can't find him.
Is that true?

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
-It's not your concern, Dick.
-Is it true?

03:56.139 --> 04:00.490
Someone will find who did it.

04:03.615 --> 04:05.082
I spoke with Ms. Bond.

04:05.116 --> 04:08.719
It sounds like
Bruce Wayne is serious
about takin' you in.

04:08.752 --> 04:11.623
-But I wanna stay with you.
-I want that, too.

04:11.657 --> 04:16.656
But part of my agreement
with your parents was
deciding what's best for you.

04:17.327 --> 04:19.430
Living with you
is what's best for me.

04:19.463 --> 04:23.199
Bruce Wayne
is a very wealthy man.

04:23.233 --> 04:26.471
And a very good man.

04:26.504 --> 04:31.504
He can give you everything
that I can't.

04:32.442 --> 04:34.843
I don't want to.

04:39.684 --> 04:42.653
Please don't make me.

04:42.685 --> 04:46.824
[sighs]

04:46.858 --> 04:49.526
I know you don't believe me,
kiddo,

04:49.560 --> 04:53.396
but trust me,
living with Bruce Wayne

04:53.430 --> 04:58.430
is gonna change
your life forever.

05:04.175 --> 05:07.324
[theme music playing]

05:21.860 --> 05:23.528
[Jason] Man, dude looks dead.

05:23.562 --> 05:28.562
[Dick] Trust me.
There's a difference between
dead and knocked out.

05:34.404 --> 05:36.439
[Jason] This is awesome!

05:36.473 --> 05:38.975
Robin and Robin, in action.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.377
Who the hell are you?

05:40.411 --> 05:45.411
Jason Todd. The new Robin.
Robin 2.0, right?

05:46.817 --> 05:48.185
[grunts]

05:48.218 --> 05:49.452
[pants]

05:49.487 --> 05:52.255
Hey, seriously, man,

05:52.288 --> 05:54.158
it's an honor to meet you.

05:54.190 --> 05:55.240
[sighs]

06:02.798 --> 06:04.235
Yep.

06:04.269 --> 06:05.970
[grunts in effort] I always
wondered what this moment
was gonna be like,

06:06.004 --> 06:09.240
never thought that
when it happened
I'd be saving your life.

06:09.273 --> 06:11.074
So, there's a new Robin, eh?

06:11.108 --> 06:13.142
Yours truly. In the flesh.

06:13.177 --> 06:14.112
[Dick grunts]

06:14.144 --> 06:16.613
-Does Batman know you're here?
-Of course.

06:16.646 --> 06:18.716
Bruce knows how badly
I've always wanted
to meet you.

06:18.750 --> 06:20.851
Pick your brain,
catch a couple of pointers,

06:20.884 --> 06:22.754
he's all, "Go for it, bro."

06:22.786 --> 06:25.154
Hey, let me go grab
my clothes.
I'll be right back.

06:25.189 --> 06:26.238
[sighs]

06:41.204 --> 06:42.341
[Jason] Can't believe it.

06:42.374 --> 06:46.444
Here we are, together,
in the same car.
This is so cool!

06:46.476 --> 06:48.478
Yeah.

06:48.512 --> 06:51.382
Real cool.

06:51.415 --> 06:55.620
[sniffles]

06:55.653 --> 06:57.689
So how long have you
and Bruce been, uh...

06:57.721 --> 07:00.257
-Been...
-Together?

07:00.290 --> 07:04.394
-Almost a year.
-A year?

07:04.427 --> 07:05.697
[chuckles softly]

07:05.730 --> 07:09.166
Wow. Okay.
Didn't waste any time.

07:09.201 --> 07:12.237
-So how did you and he--
-I was out boosting cars.

07:12.269 --> 07:15.271
Guess I chose the wrong one.
[chuckles] Or the right one.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.708
You tried to steal
the Batmobile?

07:16.740 --> 07:18.810
No, man. Just the hubcaps.

07:18.843 --> 07:20.610
And just like that,
he took you in?

07:20.644 --> 07:24.649
Guess he saw potential.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.817
So, what do you think
of the new suit?

07:26.850 --> 07:28.086
Upgrades are pretty sick,
right?

07:28.119 --> 07:30.420
The new tunic
is made with Zylon fibers,

07:30.454 --> 07:32.357
six times stronger
than Kevlar.

07:32.391 --> 07:34.625
Seriously, bro, you can
hit me with a flame thrower
from ten feet

07:34.658 --> 07:35.826
and I'd be like,
"That's all you got?"

07:35.860 --> 07:37.728
-Zylon fibers.
-Smart, right?

07:37.762 --> 07:39.697
Hey, no offense
but you gotta admit,

07:39.730 --> 07:44.730
the old version
was a little outdated.

07:48.505 --> 07:50.307
So how'd you find me anyway?

07:50.341 --> 07:51.375
The tracker.

07:51.408 --> 07:53.644
What tracker?

07:53.677 --> 07:55.846
In your arm.

07:55.879 --> 07:57.548
There's a fucking tracker
in my arm?

07:57.583 --> 08:02.151
Yeah. In mine, too.
Don't you remember him
putting it in?

08:02.185 --> 08:05.021
No.

08:05.055 --> 08:07.605
Maybe you forgot.

08:11.362 --> 08:12.596
So, where are we goin'?

08:12.629 --> 08:16.165
I gotta find a place
to put that guy.

08:16.199 --> 08:20.204
Can I make a suggestion?

08:20.237 --> 08:21.737
Sure.

08:25.110 --> 08:30.110
According to Bruce,
the design of this place
is inspired by Frank Lloyd.

08:30.615 --> 08:32.884
-Wright.
-I know, right?

08:32.917 --> 08:35.820
Dude's really into,
you know, lines and shit.

08:35.852 --> 08:37.489
Bruce has a bunch
of places like this.

08:37.522 --> 08:40.691
He calls them "safe houses,"
but they're more like condos.

08:40.725 --> 08:45.725
-Never been to one.
-You're lucky.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.666
[automated voice]
<i>Access denied.</i>

08:48.698 --> 08:50.349
I got this.

08:57.106 --> 08:58.775
<i>Access granted.</i>

08:58.809 --> 09:02.860
Guess he changed the locks.

09:23.433 --> 09:26.403
Why are you doing this?

09:26.437 --> 09:28.739
Why do you even
want to be Robin?

09:28.773 --> 09:31.942
Are you kidding?
This is the dopest gig ever.

09:31.975 --> 09:34.312
Hangin' out with Batman,
kicking bad guys' asses,

09:34.346 --> 09:39.017
being famous,
driving the goddamn Batmobile.

09:39.049 --> 09:43.850
He lets you drive
the Batmobile?

09:45.722 --> 09:47.825
Wouldn't you rather
have your own name?

09:47.859 --> 09:51.028
Like "Sparrow" or "Blue Jay,"
for "Jason"?

09:51.061 --> 09:52.197
Fuck, no.

09:52.230 --> 09:54.498
The whole point
is being Robin.

09:54.532 --> 09:56.301
Batman needs Robin.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.802
Why do you think he makes us
wear those lame colors?

09:58.836 --> 10:00.071
'Cause we're drawing fire.

10:00.105 --> 10:03.173
"Look over here, assholes!"

10:03.207 --> 10:08.207
Then boom, the Bat lands
and starts trashing ass.

10:08.278 --> 10:11.816
[elevator doors opens]

10:11.849 --> 10:16.849
Here, I'll go back
and get our friend.

10:25.129 --> 10:26.178
[pants]

10:31.635 --> 10:35.139
Who's this?

10:35.173 --> 10:37.575
-Niccolo Machiavelli.
-Oh, yeah.

10:37.607 --> 10:39.543
Bruce has talked
about that dude.

10:39.576 --> 10:42.913
Sounds like a total savage.

10:42.947 --> 10:44.649
"If an injury
has to be done to a man,

10:44.682 --> 10:49.287
it should be so severe
that his vengeance
need not to be feared.

10:49.321 --> 10:51.990
Severities should be
dealt out all at once,

10:52.023 --> 10:54.392
so that their suddenness
may give less offense.

10:54.426 --> 10:57.595
Benefits ought to be
handed out drop-by-drop

10:57.628 --> 11:02.433
so they may be
relished the more."

11:02.466 --> 11:05.135
You know, I used to
read about you as a kid.

11:05.169 --> 11:09.340
Bruce has told me tons of
awesome stories about you.

11:09.373 --> 11:10.875
I bet he has.

11:10.908 --> 11:12.177
[Jason] I know
it's none of my business,

11:12.210 --> 11:16.860
but he never said
why you quit.

11:18.982 --> 11:22.287
[grunts] I guess
I just couldn't cut it.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.188
Are you thirsty?
I'm gonna go
check out the brew sitch.

11:24.221 --> 11:27.827
-What?
-The beer situation.

12:00.157 --> 12:01.506
[pinging]

12:20.443 --> 12:23.443
[cell phone ringing]

12:27.251 --> 12:28.385
You've got impeccable timing.

12:28.419 --> 12:31.322
-Where the hell are you?
<i>-Chicago.</i>

12:31.355 --> 12:33.157
I thought you were
coming back here.

12:33.191 --> 12:35.960
Things got a little weird
at our friend's apartment.

12:35.993 --> 12:37.294
His name is Dr. Adamson,
by the way.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.397
<i>Doctor of what,
I have no idea.</i>

12:39.431 --> 12:41.099
Let me guess.
He tried to kill you.

12:41.131 --> 12:43.033
He tried to cook me
breakfast, actually.

12:43.067 --> 12:44.635
His friends tried to kill me.

12:44.668 --> 12:46.937
<i>Six of them. I got the feeling there's more
where they came from.</i>

12:46.971 --> 12:49.306
You took out six assassins
by yourself?

12:49.339 --> 12:50.407
Not bad.

12:50.441 --> 12:53.243
Robin's got some skills.

12:53.277 --> 12:54.476
[grunts]

12:59.783 --> 13:03.486
Any update on the family?

13:03.519 --> 13:07.292
Um, they're all dead.

13:07.325 --> 13:08.960
-Kory.
<i>-I didn't kill them.</i>

13:08.993 --> 13:11.861
I just walked in
and they were, like, dead.

13:11.895 --> 13:14.498
<i>Their heads exploded.</i>

13:14.530 --> 13:15.633
Hell of a coincidence.

13:15.666 --> 13:19.903
-I... [scoffs]
<i>-Ah, fuck.</i>

13:19.937 --> 13:23.374
[grunts softly]

13:23.407 --> 13:26.744
<i>Are you okay?</i>

13:26.777 --> 13:29.080
Just dealing with something.

13:29.113 --> 13:30.648
<i>Look, you guys
need to get out here.</i>

13:30.681 --> 13:32.450
I'm at 888
North Lakeshore Drive.

13:32.484 --> 13:35.153
<i>It's less than an hour.
You'll be safe here.</i>

13:35.186 --> 13:37.654
-Are you sure?
<i>-It's a safe house.</i>

13:37.687 --> 13:42.488
It has "safe"
right in the name.

13:44.294 --> 13:46.597
Hey, Jason, thanks
for the help back there.

13:46.630 --> 13:50.067
But I'm good now.
You should head back
to Gotham.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.570
What the hell, man?

13:51.602 --> 13:56.073
I'm not Robin anymore.
Have a safe trip back.

13:56.106 --> 13:57.375
You didn't have to do that.

13:57.408 --> 13:59.811
-Yeah, I did.
And you should, too.
-Why?

13:59.845 --> 14:02.246
Because we're not animals
in Bruce Wayne's private zoo.

14:02.279 --> 14:06.250
You don't get it, man.
He did it for you. For us.

14:06.283 --> 14:08.753
In case anything ever
happened, he could find us.

14:08.785 --> 14:10.488
Thanks for stopping by.

14:10.522 --> 14:12.956
Tell Bruce
I'm gonna need the place
for a couple of days.

14:12.990 --> 14:16.961
He should be okay with it.

14:16.994 --> 14:19.364
I'm not sure you really
understand him, man.

14:19.397 --> 14:23.701
I think I'm the one guy
in the world that does.

14:23.734 --> 14:25.269
Look, Jason,

14:25.302 --> 14:27.639
he might have you thinking
that you're a partnership,

14:27.672 --> 14:32.672
but everything Bruce does
is in the best interest
of one person. Bruce.

14:34.077 --> 14:35.947
Time to go.

14:35.980 --> 14:40.317
Sorry, man. I can't.

14:40.350 --> 14:45.000
He wanted me
to show you these.

14:50.260 --> 14:51.897
[Dick] How did you get these?

14:51.929 --> 14:55.966
[Jason] They were sent
to the Gotham PD
addressed to "Robin."

14:56.000 --> 15:01.000
Whoever sent them
thinks you're still Robin.

15:01.705 --> 15:04.705
I know these people.

15:06.910 --> 15:11.481
[crowd cheering]

15:11.514 --> 15:13.164
[inaudible]

15:19.990 --> 15:22.990
[cheering continues]

15:32.503 --> 15:34.153
[chuckling]

15:40.510 --> 15:43.880
[both grunting]

15:43.913 --> 15:45.182
Come here, kiddo.

15:45.216 --> 15:47.466
[both laughing]

15:50.921 --> 15:54.392
[yells]

15:54.424 --> 15:58.395
I worked with them
at the Haly's Circus.

15:58.428 --> 16:02.033
-[Jason] Before your
parents were...
-Yeah.

16:02.066 --> 16:04.168
[Jason] That must've sucked.

16:04.201 --> 16:06.705
-He burns them with acid.
-Hydrofluoric acid.

16:06.738 --> 16:08.839
[Jason] Calling card
of the Maroni crime family.

16:08.873 --> 16:11.842
-Harvey Dent, your parents--
-I know.

16:11.876 --> 16:15.446
Tony Zucco worked
for the Maronis
when he killed my parents.

16:15.480 --> 16:19.750
But they were
put away years ago.

16:19.783 --> 16:21.951
Why'd he do it?

16:21.985 --> 16:24.020
Haly owed the Maronis
protection money.

16:24.054 --> 16:27.759
Couldn't come up
with the cash.

16:27.792 --> 16:32.792
So my parents paid the debt
with their lives.

16:35.634 --> 16:37.402
Papers call this guy
"the Melting Man,"

16:37.434 --> 16:40.804
because he melts
the flesh right
off their bones.

16:40.837 --> 16:43.837
Creepy as shit, huh?

16:46.277 --> 16:47.544
Any idea who this freak is?

16:47.578 --> 16:49.613
The man
I'm thinking of is dead.

16:49.647 --> 16:51.115
So that's a no.

16:51.149 --> 16:56.120
[sighs]

16:56.153 --> 16:57.655
Have you checked back in
with the police?

16:57.688 --> 17:00.524
Why would I go
to the fucking cops?

17:00.557 --> 17:03.226
-Because five people
were murdered.
-The cops are a joke, man.

17:03.260 --> 17:07.131
There's two kinds,
useless and dirty.

17:07.164 --> 17:10.602
-Is that what Bruce says?
-No, it's what I say.

17:10.634 --> 17:14.138
They hit a dead end
so they came crawling
to Bruce and me. As usual.

17:14.173 --> 17:19.173
When Bruce realized
who the victims were,
he sent me to find you.

17:22.279 --> 17:24.829
[chuckles softly]

17:32.722 --> 17:34.825
[sighs]

17:34.858 --> 17:38.929
-You mind?
-Sure thing.

17:38.962 --> 17:41.164
[typing]

17:41.199 --> 17:42.199
Boom!

17:49.207 --> 17:51.910
[chuckles]

17:51.942 --> 17:54.479
[Dick] Phone bill paid
last month, utilities on.

17:54.511 --> 17:59.250
Looks like he's still alive.

17:59.282 --> 18:01.852

18:01.885 --> 18:04.087

<i>This is Clay Williams.</i>

18:05.557 --> 18:08.025
<i>I'm not home right now,
so please leave a message.</i>

18:08.058 --> 18:10.294
[beeps]

18:10.327 --> 18:12.997
Milwaukee's only an hour
and a half from here.

18:13.029 --> 18:14.531
I gotta go make sure
he's safe.

18:14.566 --> 18:17.335
-We're going on a road trip.
Excellent.
-Not us. Me.

18:17.367 --> 18:19.837
Look, I appreciate
you bringing this to me.
I really do.

18:19.871 --> 18:23.441
But there's no reason
for you to come.
This is personal.

18:23.473 --> 18:25.675
You're Bruce's Robin,
not mine.

18:25.709 --> 18:26.978
No, I'm my Robin.

18:27.011 --> 18:30.681
-I don't need your help.
-You did back
at that apartment.

18:30.713 --> 18:33.413
[computer beeping]

18:35.986 --> 18:36.986
Hmm!

18:46.931 --> 18:50.801
[elevator dings]

18:50.835 --> 18:53.203
-[Jason] Who are your friends?
-[Dick] Not important.

18:53.237 --> 18:54.571
-Who's he?
-Not important.

18:54.605 --> 18:56.240
-Anybody want a brew?
-Yeah, I do.

18:56.273 --> 18:57.909
No, he doesn't.
No one wants a brew.

18:57.942 --> 19:01.010
-That can't be Adamson.
-He's not Adamson.
Adamson's in the bathroom.

19:01.045 --> 19:02.646
-Unconscious.
-Hi, I'm Rachel.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.883
-Jason.
-Okay, who we all are
doesn't matter right now.

19:04.915 --> 19:07.951
Can we just chill out,
relax, sit on the couch
and watch TV or something?

19:07.984 --> 19:09.386
Yo, when did you
get another one?

19:09.420 --> 19:10.855
-That one's mine.
-[Gar] Yours?

19:10.888 --> 19:13.656
-Wait, you're Robin, too?
-I thought you were Robin.

19:13.690 --> 19:15.393
-I am.
-He was.

19:15.425 --> 19:17.327
[chuckles] Okay,
how many Robins are there?

19:17.361 --> 19:19.130
Are there a lot?
'Cause I would love to--

19:19.163 --> 19:20.696
Okay, quiet.

19:20.730 --> 19:25.035
Sit.

19:25.068 --> 19:26.419
Bathroom.

19:31.942 --> 19:36.942
-[whispers] Can I be Robin?
-Oh, my God.

19:38.250 --> 19:42.920
-What happened to him?
-I gave him something
to help him sleep.

19:42.952 --> 19:45.122
I kind of had my hands full.

19:45.155 --> 19:47.557
Well, did he say anything?

19:47.592 --> 19:50.094
He said he works
for something
called "the Organization."

19:50.126 --> 19:52.529
And they work
for Rachel's father.

19:52.563 --> 19:55.232
He seemed to have
people everywhere.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.534
You sure you weren't followed?

19:56.567 --> 19:57.968
You sure you weren't?

19:58.001 --> 19:59.202
-Him?
-Yeah.

19:59.237 --> 20:02.306
[chuckles] He's not
with the Organization.

20:02.339 --> 20:06.411
-He works for Batman, too?
-Yeah.

20:06.443 --> 20:08.979
He's my replacement.

20:09.012 --> 20:10.449
Oh, good.

20:10.481 --> 20:13.651
Yeah, that's good.
You said you didn't wanna be
Robin anymore, right?

20:13.684 --> 20:17.555
-Right.
-All right, so problem solved.

20:17.588 --> 20:22.192
Unless, of course,
you do wanna be Robin.

20:22.226 --> 20:26.030
In which case,
you should be Robin.

20:26.064 --> 20:30.902
Even though the new one's
probably younger,
and healthier and smarter.

20:30.935 --> 20:33.605
I'm just trying to get used
to the idea of being replaced.

20:33.637 --> 20:38.637
Wow. An honest answer,
for once. Well done.

20:40.111 --> 20:43.346
What is he doing here, anyway?

20:43.381 --> 20:45.182
Some people I know
were killed.

20:45.215 --> 20:47.585
The killer's still out there.

20:47.618 --> 20:49.686
There's someone
I need to check on,
make sure he's okay.

20:49.721 --> 20:52.190
-So go.
-What about him?

20:52.223 --> 20:56.894
He is handcuffed
and unconscious.
Pretty sure I can handle it.

20:56.928 --> 20:58.929
Unless you want me
to come with you.

20:58.962 --> 20:59.998
No. This is my problem.

21:00.030 --> 21:02.400
I'll be back. But I should
probably talk to Rachel.

21:02.432 --> 21:04.769
Oh, she's used to it by now.

21:04.803 --> 21:08.172
-What about the other Robin?
-He's comin' with me.

21:08.204 --> 21:10.407
[chuckles]

21:10.441 --> 21:12.477
And try not
to kill this one, okay?

21:12.509 --> 21:15.246
I didn't kill them.

21:15.278 --> 21:19.049

in a bluegrass band,</i>

<i>but didn't you wanna
work with them?</i>

21:25.221 --> 21:26.657
[man]<i>Uh-huh.</i>

21:26.691 --> 21:29.192
[woman]<i>Hmm.
And you basically created
a new genre.</i>

21:29.226 --> 21:30.394
<i>What do you call it again?</i>

21:30.428 --> 21:32.596
[man] <i>Well, if you take
bluegrass and jazz</i>

21:32.630 --> 21:35.633
<i>and put 'em together,
you get "bluegrazz."</i>

21:35.666 --> 21:37.336

21:37.368 --> 21:40.304

so new and fresh,
it took me by surprise.</i>

I was hoping for.</i>

21:53.916 --> 21:54.967
[sighs]

22:45.202 --> 22:49.039
The place is called Corvo.
It's some kind of speakeasy.

22:49.074 --> 22:51.608
Landlord said
he bounces the late shift.

22:51.642 --> 22:53.711
That's too bad.
Bouncers are assholes.

22:53.744 --> 22:56.682
Clay's not.
And how would you know anyway?

22:56.714 --> 22:59.884
Uncle Ray would take me
to bars with him all the time
when I was little.

22:59.917 --> 23:02.420
Everyone thought it was cute,
till it wasn't.

23:02.452 --> 23:03.922
He was a fun drunk.

23:03.954 --> 23:05.690
Then he'd get stupid,
then he'd start
throwing punches...

23:05.722 --> 23:07.490
Then the bouncers
would kick our asses out.

23:07.525 --> 23:08.759
Where were your folks?

23:08.792 --> 23:11.762
Mom was upstate.
Dad was downstate.

23:11.796 --> 23:14.230
Uncle Ray was the man
until he OD'd when I was 13.

23:14.265 --> 23:16.233
-Where'd you go?
-Wherever.

23:16.268 --> 23:20.538
Foster care. In and out
of the system,
the streets mostly after that.

23:20.570 --> 23:24.041
[chuckles] It's not all bad.
I survived.

23:24.075 --> 23:29.075
Now look, man,
we're living the dream.

-Yeah?

get into the VIP lounge?

25:02.640 --> 25:06.044
Dicky! Oh, Lord,
I can't believe it's you!

25:06.076 --> 25:07.778
-Is this you?
-Yeah, it's me.
I can't breathe.

you're next on the list.

You've seen anything
weird at home?

25:44.548 --> 25:46.718
Any people following you?

25:46.750 --> 25:49.086
Not that I've noticed.

25:49.119 --> 25:52.324
You still in touch
with anyone from the circus?
Since it shut down?

25:52.356 --> 25:56.060
I spoke to Abigail
a few years ago
after her husband died.

25:56.094 --> 25:59.663

with Percy
but I could never find him.

After the...

26:02.133 --> 26:07.037
[sighs] We all went
our own separate ways.

26:07.070 --> 26:08.605
Yeah.

26:08.638 --> 26:12.410
I think the last time
I saw any of them

26:12.442 --> 26:16.942
were at your parents' funeral.

26:18.583 --> 26:21.317
I should've kept in touch.

26:21.352 --> 26:22.619
Especially with you.

26:22.653 --> 26:27.592
Hey, it goes both ways.
I'm just glad you're okay.

-Detective, actually.

All I know is I'm just
so proud of you, kiddo.

27:08.532 --> 27:11.001
You know,
I used to wonder all the time,

27:11.036 --> 27:14.337
what my life would be like
if I'd stayed with you?

27:14.372 --> 27:16.875
You know,
gone to a normal school,

27:16.907 --> 27:19.076
had some normal friends.

27:19.108 --> 27:21.244
"Normal"?

27:21.278 --> 27:23.614
You mean "poor."

27:23.647 --> 27:26.683
'Cause that's what
it would've been. Poor.

27:26.718 --> 27:31.718
But look at how
you turned out. Perfect.

27:32.288 --> 27:35.459

Did you say somethin'?

You arrived right on schedule.

You know.

It's not possible.

because of this.

30:33.938 --> 30:35.307
You're cutting him a deal?

30:35.339 --> 30:38.375
Tony Zucco knows the players.
He knows the locations.

30:38.410 --> 30:40.278
And he knows
where the bodies are buried.

30:40.311 --> 30:43.347
He's the key to bringing down
the entire Maroni family.

30:43.381 --> 30:46.217
Instead of one guy,
we're gonna take down 50,
maybe more.

30:46.250 --> 30:48.653
That man murdered my parents
and you're letting him
walk free?

30:48.685 --> 30:51.021
We can't prove that,
Mr. Grayson.

30:51.055 --> 30:52.856
And he's not walking free.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.660
He'll be
in protective custody.

30:54.692 --> 30:59.692
His whole family will have
to be once the Maronis
find out he snitched on them.

31:01.098 --> 31:03.134
Things like this
happen all the time.

31:03.167 --> 31:05.303
I know it doesn't
seem fair, Mr. Grayson--

31:05.336 --> 31:07.872
[Dick] This is why people
like Batman do what they do.

31:07.904 --> 31:09.641
You don't cut a deal
with a guy like Tony Zucco.

31:09.674 --> 31:11.676
You lock him in a jail cell
until he takes
his last breath.

31:11.710 --> 31:16.710
Then you bury him under
the jail and burn it
to the ground.

32:13.604 --> 32:17.054
[driver] What the fuck?

32:18.942 --> 32:21.011
Jesus!

32:21.045 --> 32:22.680
-Watch out!
-[tires screeching]

32:22.712 --> 32:24.882
[grunts]

32:24.915 --> 32:26.250
What the hell's happening?

32:26.284 --> 32:30.554
[guard] Someone's on
the fucking roof. Come on.

32:30.587 --> 32:32.089
[gun cocking]

32:32.123 --> 32:35.558
-Oh, fuck!
-[driver] I don't see him!

32:35.593 --> 32:37.827
[guard] Keep looking.

[grunts]

33:08.659 --> 33:10.561
Please.

33:10.595 --> 33:13.864
How many people
have you killed that
begged for their life?

33:13.897 --> 33:15.532
Look, I'll give you
whatever you want.

33:15.566 --> 33:19.336
I want my parents back!

33:19.369 --> 33:21.972
Grayson.

33:22.006 --> 33:24.674
[grunts]

33:24.709 --> 33:26.810
Give me one reason not to.

33:26.844 --> 33:27.443

34:01.011 --> 34:03.748
[Zucco] The Maronis.

34:03.780 --> 34:08.186
[guns firing]

34:08.219 --> 34:13.023
You gotta help me.

34:13.056 --> 34:16.594
Please.

34:16.626 --> 34:17.626
No.

34:25.702 --> 34:27.202
[gunshots]

34:49.994 --> 34:52.230
I killed his father.

34:52.262 --> 34:55.065
[Jason] The guy who murdered
your parents?

34:55.099 --> 34:57.001
That's a win either way
you look at it.

34:57.034 --> 34:59.369
One less scumbag
on the face of the planet.

34:59.403 --> 35:01.871
Man,
that must've felt awesome.

35:01.905 --> 35:03.206
Yeah, that's the problem.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.244
Hey, you want my advice?
Don't be Robin.

35:06.277 --> 35:07.746
All those years
Bruce was helping me?

35:07.778 --> 35:10.014
He was turning me
into a weapon, his weapon.

35:10.047 --> 35:13.050
And he may have you convinced
that you can get everything
you ever wanted,

35:13.085 --> 35:16.487
but you can't unlearn
what he teaches you
and you can't control it.

35:16.521 --> 35:19.023
Believe me,
the price is too high.

35:19.056 --> 35:21.905
[cell phone chimes]

35:47.150 --> 35:49.219
-I gotta go.
-Where?

35:49.253 --> 35:51.222
I gotta take care
of this by myself.

35:51.255 --> 35:53.505

36:39.704 --> 36:44.704
[Melting Man]
That's close enough, Robin.

36:47.612 --> 36:52.612
I'm the one
you're looking for.
Let Clay go.

36:54.550 --> 36:56.487
Dick?

36:56.521 --> 36:57.789
You're gonna be okay, Clay.

36:57.822 --> 37:00.824
[Melting Man] No, he isn't.
He's going to die.

37:00.858 --> 37:03.360
So are you.

37:03.393 --> 37:06.431
You should thank me.
Death is better.

37:06.463 --> 37:08.465
-What happened to you?
-You did.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.135
The feds told me
what happened.

37:10.168 --> 37:14.972
Robin hijacked my father's
transport and offered him
up to the Maronis.

37:15.007 --> 37:17.342
After your little meltdown
in the feds' office,

37:17.375 --> 37:20.244
it wasn't hard
to link you to Robin.

37:20.277 --> 37:22.213
I didn't know
the Maronis would be there.

37:22.246 --> 37:24.849
No, you wanted
to do the honors.

37:24.882 --> 37:29.353
Either way, it seems
I have you to thank
for what followed.

37:29.387 --> 37:33.391
Seems your little act
of revenge had consequences.

37:33.423 --> 37:37.228
After my father was killed,
the deal was off.

37:37.260 --> 37:40.231
No more federal protection.

37:40.264 --> 37:43.733
So, the Maronis
came after my mother...

37:43.766 --> 37:46.070
And my sister...

37:46.103 --> 37:49.273
And my fiancee.

37:49.306 --> 37:52.210
They all melted.

37:52.242 --> 37:54.846
They tried to melt me, too.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.782
So, you thought
you'd even the score
by killing my family.

37:57.815 --> 38:02.815
That make you feel better?
Did your fucking plan work?

38:08.559 --> 38:12.309
Beyond my wildest dreams.

38:15.833 --> 38:19.336
When the acid strikes
your skin, it doesn't burn.

38:19.369 --> 38:21.639
It's much worse.

38:21.672 --> 38:26.344
-It's like insects eating away
at your flesh...
-[grunting]

38:26.376 --> 38:29.514
...burrowing inside of you.

38:29.547 --> 38:34.547
I can still feel them
crawling all over me.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.922
I didn't want this
to happen to you, Nick.

38:37.954 --> 38:40.824
I'm not Nick anymore.

38:40.858 --> 38:45.730
That's what the acid
did for me. It changed me.

38:45.764 --> 38:48.532
-[sizzling]
-[exclaiming in agony]

38:48.565 --> 38:50.802
You revealed
your true self on that bridge.

38:50.835 --> 38:55.072
Just like the acid peeled
away the surface to reveal
my true self underneath.

38:55.106 --> 38:56.340
He's an innocent man.

38:56.373 --> 38:57.876
-Let him go.
-No!

38:57.909 --> 39:02.909
He gave you an out, dumb-ass.
You should've taken it.

Oh, you're welcome,
by the way,
for saving your life.

And you're welcome
for me saving your life.

What do you think
you're doing? They're cops.

41:34.065 --> 41:35.632
That's the coolest part
about being Robin.

41:35.666 --> 41:38.469
Wearin' a mask. I can do
whatever the fuck I want.

41:38.503 --> 41:40.271
Did you not just hear
what I said?

41:40.304 --> 41:42.539
There is no way Batman's cool
with beatin' up cops.

41:42.572 --> 41:45.277
He isn't.
But I don't see him here.

41:45.309 --> 41:49.047
The cops in Gotham
kicked my ass every night.
Now I get to kick back.

41:49.079 --> 41:51.983
You obviously have
your own shit goin' on.

41:52.016 --> 41:54.219
But you're gonna wake up
one day and have
no idea who you are.

I don't wanna be Robin"

I'm tryin' to give it up.

Know what?

43:04.487 --> 43:08.387
That you work with Batman?

43:11.128 --> 43:14.277
I don't. Not anymore.
