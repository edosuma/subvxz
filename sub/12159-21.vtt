I'M AN EMBARRASSING
OLD DORK.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.004
WHY WOULD I WANT TO ADD
"OVERLY SENSITIVE" TO THAT LIST?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.706
UH, YOU NEED HELP WITH THAT,
MOM?

08:27.708 --> 08:30.275
NO, BUT IT IS NICE TO KNOW
I HAVE AT LEAST ONE DAUGHTER

08:30.277 --> 08:32.110
WHO ISN'T ASHAMED
TO BE SEEN WITH ME.

08:32.112 --> 08:35.313
I'M NOT ASHAMED
AROUND THE HOUSE.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.215
CAN'T YOU EVER
JUST BE NICE TO HER?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.316
IT'S IMPORTANT WITH PARENTS
TO SET LIMITS,

08:38.318 --> 08:40.118
OR THEY'LL NEVER LEARN.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.455
SHE ACTUALLY TRIED TO FIX EVE UP
WITH A KID FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.057
WHAT? WHO?
I DON'T KNOW --
SOME RANDOM SCIENCE NERD.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.393
OH, YIKES. POOR EVE.

08:48.395 --> 08:51.229
REMEMBER WHEN MOM TRIED TO
SET ME UP WITH THAT DOCTOR...

08:51.231 --> 08:53.365
WHILE HE WAS DELIVERING
MY BABY?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.401
HI, VANESSA.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.669
HEY, CAROL, CHUCK.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.304

A MOVIE ABOUT HIM,

YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE GREAT
IN THE PART?

NEXT TIME WE PLAY GOLF,
I'M GONNA BURY YOU.

ONE OF THOSE HOLES YOU
DUG WITH YOUR PUTTER.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.377
IT WAS GREAT.

THERE AND TALK TO OUR GUESTS?

IN, LIKE, ANY MINUTE.

THAT WORKED OUT.

I INTRODUCED HER TO.

FOR AN HOUR THE OTHER NIGHT.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.761
HE'S PRETTY COOL
ONCE YOU GET PAST THE FACT

09:56.763 --> 09:58.797
THAT HE'S GROWING PIG EMBRYOS
IN HIS WINDOWSILL.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.865
WELL, WHAT -- WHAT --
HE'S LIKE A SCIENCE GEEK

WELL -- WELL,
YOU CAN'T GO SEE HIM NOW.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.640
WE'RE HAVING A FAMILY BARBECUE.
WHO AM I GONNA TALK TO?

10:08.642 --> 10:10.575
UH, HOW ABOUT
THE REST OF YOUR FAMILY?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.210
UH, NOT REALLY MY THING.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.614
SORRY. BLAME MOM.
SHE'S THE ONE WHO PIMPED ME OUT.

HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

OF BACKWARDS-HAT.

THESE GUYS' NAMES?

WHEN KRIS MARRIES YOGA-PANTS,
I'LL LEARN HIS.

WHERE'S BRANDON TODAY?

10:28.629 --> 10:30.228
WHERE DID HE SAY
HE WAS GOING?

OUT.

10:31.598 --> 10:33.732
YEAH, HE'S OUT.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.002

THAT BRANDON'S
NOT COMING.

BE DISAPPOINTED?

MY WINE GLASS FOR.

ANOTHER BOY IN HER LIFE

10:51.752 --> 10:53.118
TO START MONOPOLIZING
HER TIME.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.819

BECAUSE YOU WANT TO.

YOUR LITTLE BUDDY AROUND

TO GET ATTACHED TO THESE KIDS

WHEN WE BROUGHT THEM HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

11:07.701 --> 11:11.369
UH, I WAS JUST TALKING
TO THE LARABEES.

11:11.371 --> 11:14.039
THEY SAID THAT EVE
AND THEIR SON ARE DATING.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.056
ABOUT MY SON GOING OUT
WITH THAT BOY.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.329
HEY, MIKE BAXTER HERE
FOR OUTDOOR MAN.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.765
HOW INVOLVED SHOULD WE BE
IN OUR KIDS' LIVES?

16:40.767 --> 16:43.701
WELL, WHEN THEY'RE BABIES,
THEY'RE COMPLETELY HELPLESS,

16:43.703 --> 16:45.203
AND YOU HAVE TO CHECK IN
ON THEM,

16:45.205 --> 16:47.705
YOU KNOW, ONCE, TWICE A DAY.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.308
BUT AS THEY GET OLDER,
WE NEED TO TURN THEM INTO PEOPLE

WHO CAN GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
ON THEIR OWN.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.278
NOW, IN THE OLD DAYS,
IT HAPPENED SOONER.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.848
YOUR DAUGHTER WOULD GET MARRIED
OUT TO FARMER BROWN AT 13,

16:56.850 --> 16:59.117
WHICH WAS OKAY BECAUSE --
LET'S BE HONEST --

16:59.119 --> 17:00.785
HER BEST YEARS WERE BEHIND HER.

17:00.787 --> 17:04.989
PLUS, HE PROBABLY HAD ENOUGH
GOATS TO MAKE THE DEAL.

17:04.991 --> 17:07.825
WELL, NOWADAYS, IT TAKES KIDS
LONGER TO BECOME INDEPENDENT.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.227
NOW, WHY IS THAT?

17:09.229 --> 17:11.996
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
THEY TRY TO PULL AWAY,

17:11.998 --> 17:13.398
AND WE HOLD ON TIGHTER.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.233

SUBTLE CLUES

TO BECOME INDEPENDENT --

"I HATE YOU!"

17:21.241 --> 17:24.375

"I WISH YOU WERE DEAD."

17:24.377 --> 17:26.244
MY ADVICE --
STAY CLOSE TO YOUR KIDS,

17:26.246 --> 17:28.579
BUT WHEN THEY'RE READY TO GO,
LET 'EM GO.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.081

OF FLUNKING PEOPLE?

17:59.746 --> 18:01.045

WELL, YOU PROBABLY HAD
YOUR TOWELETTES WITH YOU.

18:10.423 --> 18:14.525
OH, NO, NO. THIS WAS BIGGER
THAN TOWELETTES.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.527

BUT SHE DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT.

THAT'S A RARE THING, HUH?

3 BILLION OF THEM LEFT.

DON'T WANT YOUR HELP ANYMORE.

I TOTALLY RUINED MY PANTS,
