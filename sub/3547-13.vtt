WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:02.125
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.208 --> 00:04.250
<i>While Ian's wife, Jane,</i>
<i>was in a coma...</i>

00:04.333 --> 00:05.250
Do we have a deal?

00:05.333 --> 00:06.667
<i>...Susan got an ultimatum.</i>

00:06.750 --> 00:09.834
He's not crazy about me
spending time with my ex.

00:10.542 --> 00:12.417
<i>Mike's new hero...</i>

00:12.500 --> 00:14.125
I owe you one.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.959
After those mutts
knocked you around the other day,

00:16.041 --> 00:17.250
your boy paid them off.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.333
<i>...had a secret agenda.</i>

00:19.417 --> 00:22.417
- Gabrielle.
<i>- Gabrielle learned the identity...</i>

00:22.500 --> 00:24.542
I'm rich now.
I can give you anything you want.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.250
<i>...of her secret admirer.</i>

00:26.333 --> 00:27.333
Tell me everything.

00:27.417 --> 00:30.709
<i>And Orson's mother</i>
<i>shared some family secrets</i>

00:30.792 --> 00:35.250
<i>that Bree would later discover.</i>

00:38.375 --> 00:42.041
<i>If there was one thing</i>
<i>Orson Hodge understood,</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:43.583
<i>it was teeth.</i>

00:45.709 --> 00:48.458
<i>That's why</i>
<i>people stopped him at barbecues,</i>

00:50.417 --> 00:52.542
<i>during cocktail parties</i>

00:54.458 --> 00:57.125
<i>and in the occasional men's room.</i>

00:59.875 --> 01:02.000
<i>Yes, when it came to teeth,</i>

01:02.083 --> 01:05.875
<i>people expected Dr Hodge</i>
<i>to have all the answers.</i>

01:06.875 --> 01:10.709
<i>Sadly for Orson,</i>
<i>this was not always the case.</i>

01:13.750 --> 01:15.834
Well, it does look a little fishy.

01:15.917 --> 01:18.959
Fishy? It couldn't be more obvious.

01:19.041 --> 01:22.375
Alma killed Monique.
That's why she disappeared.

01:22.458 --> 01:23.500
And I bet she pulled the teeth

01:23.583 --> 01:25.417
so people would suspect
her dentist husband.

01:25.500 --> 01:27.083
Well, why would she keep them?

01:27.166 --> 01:29.500
She was probably gonna sneak in
and plant them in our house.

01:29.583 --> 01:31.250
Well, we've saved her the trouble,
haven't we?

01:31.333 --> 01:32.834
Is it a full set?

01:33.875 --> 01:35.792
Orson, not on the duvet.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.917
- Oh, it's okay. They won't stain.
- I don't care.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.083
I am not sleeping in the bed that
had your dead mistress's teeth in it.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.375
Let's just take them to the police.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.041
And say what?

01:46.125 --> 01:48.125
We can't prove
these came from Alma's.

01:48.208 --> 01:49.500
She'll deny ever having seen them.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.208
And don't forget,
I'm the one they suspect.

01:51.291 --> 01:52.792
Well, we have to do something.

01:52.875 --> 01:57.333
I agree, but not until
we put these back in her house.

01:57.417 --> 02:01.625
- And then we'll call the police.
- Trust me. She'll never get away with it.

02:14.625 --> 02:15.834
Hello.

02:16.542 --> 02:18.583
You've been very naughty,
haven't you?

02:18.667 --> 02:22.500
Orson? Is that you?

02:22.583 --> 02:25.709
I know what you and Alma are up to,
and it's gonna stop.

02:25.792 --> 02:29.667
<i>Yes, Orson was an expert on teeth.</i>

02:29.750 --> 02:33.750
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.208
Oh, I think you do.

02:36.291 --> 02:40.500
<i>That's how he could tell</i>
<i>when people were lying through them.</i>

03:22.583 --> 03:25.500
<i>It can happen so quickly.</i>

03:25.583 --> 03:27.792
<i>In the moment</i>
<i>it takes a gunman's bullet</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:30.041
<i>to enter his victim's leg.</i>

03:31.041 --> 03:36.291
<i>In the time it takes to tell a wife</i>
<i>her husband won't be home for dinner.</i>

03:37.250 --> 03:42.208
<i>In the instant it takes a father</i>
<i>to meet his son for the very first time.</i>

03:45.417 --> 03:49.166
<i>Yes, life, as we know it, can change</i>

03:50.959 --> 03:52.834
<i>in a heartbeat.</i>

03:52.917 --> 03:55.041
- Jane's still running a fever?
- Yes.

03:55.125 --> 03:58.750
And she hasn't responded
to any of the meds that we've tried.

03:58.834 --> 04:00.375
You think we should call her husband?

04:00.458 --> 04:01.959
Not just yet.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.875
Let's try vancomycin.
It worked for her before.

04:04.959 --> 04:07.000
I don't want Ian to worry.

04:07.709 --> 04:11.417
This is your new lawyer, Alan Marcus.
Alan, this is Mike Delfino.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.792
Hey, Mike. Sorry I couldn't
start on your case sooner.

04:13.875 --> 04:16.375
I was wrapping up
an armed robbery trial.

04:16.458 --> 04:19.417
It's nice to finally meet you.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.375
And you must be Ian.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.375
I can't thank you enough
for helping me out here.

04:24.458 --> 04:27.458
Susan and I are happy
to be of assistance.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.166
- So, should we get started?
- Sure.

04:38.667 --> 04:42.125
So, Mike, I've had a chance to review
all the evidence against you,

04:42.208 --> 04:46.083
and I've got a strategy
to ensure your case never goes to trial.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.709
Don't you love this guy?
What's the strategy?

04:49.792 --> 04:52.000
Pleading guilty?
What kind of a strategy is that?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.709
He'd only be pleading to manslaughter.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.417
It's still 10 years in prison.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.792
Well, which is better than life,

04:56.875 --> 04:58.500
and that's what Mike's risking
if he goes to trial.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.667
With good behaviour,
he could be out in five.

05:00.750 --> 05:03.583
With a better lawyer,
he could be out in zero.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.125
We need to find a lawyer
who believes that he's innocent.

05:06.208 --> 05:07.959
Well, the evidence against him
is very compelling.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.625
You're letting your feelings for him
cloud your judgement.

05:10.709 --> 05:13.625
My feelings for him?
Are we gonna do this again?

05:13.709 --> 05:17.333
Do you realise that every conversation
we have winds up being about Mike.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.667
"Who's the best lawyer for Mike?
How can we get Mike acquitted?"

05:19.750 --> 05:22.500
I have told you I love you
a thousand times.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.291
Where is all this jealousy coming from?

05:27.458 --> 05:30.792
Do you know what?
I have to catch that plane to Montreal.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.792
What? No, Ian.
We have to talk about this.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.583
I can't be late. It's business.

05:36.667 --> 05:39.917
Look, I have provided Mike
with the best lawyer I know.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.709
If you want to get someone else,
then you're on your own.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.166
What you doing?

05:50.250 --> 05:54.750
Oh, deciding what to wear
my first day back to work.

05:54.834 --> 05:58.709
- Do I look fat in this?
- I think you look good in everything.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.208
Wow. Your father has taught you well.

06:02.291 --> 06:03.792
What about the street fair?

06:03.875 --> 06:06.375
If you're going back to work,
who's gonna take me?

06:06.458 --> 06:09.625
- Mrs McCluskey. Won't that be fun?
- No.

06:10.834 --> 06:13.959
- Do you have to go back to work?
- Come on.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.500
You and your brothers will be thrilled.

06:16.583 --> 06:19.375
Don't you get tired of me yelling at you

06:19.458 --> 06:22.709
to clean up your room
and finish your homework?

06:22.792 --> 06:26.458
Yeah, but you've been a lot nicer
since you got shot.

06:28.792 --> 06:31.041
Oh, well, that's good to know.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.458
When you think about it,

06:32.542 --> 06:35.625
me going back to work
is not that big a deal.

06:35.709 --> 06:38.375
We're only losing a little time together
in the afternoon.

06:38.458 --> 06:42.291
But every hour counts.
I miss you all day long.

06:44.041 --> 06:47.458
Oh, honey. Jeez.

06:51.166 --> 06:52.417
Do you really mean that

06:52.500 --> 06:57.500
or are you manipulating Mommy
into feeling incredibly guilty?

06:57.583 --> 06:59.458
A little bit of both.

07:00.542 --> 07:03.291
Yep. Your father's taught you well.

07:07.792 --> 07:11.000
- The suspense is killing me.
- Here it comes.

07:11.083 --> 07:14.083
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

07:14.917 --> 07:19.458
the winner of this year's
Little Miss Snowflake Pageant is

07:19.667 --> 07:21.875
Sherri Maltby!

07:32.834 --> 07:34.041
God, I'm in shock.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.125
I mean, I knew she had a shot
at the top five,

07:36.208 --> 07:37.750
but to actually win?

07:37.834 --> 07:39.417
I was sure she'd lose
to that little blonde bitch

07:39.500 --> 07:41.333
who sang that patriotic medley.

07:41.417 --> 07:45.041
I know. She practically had sparklers
coming out of her ass.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.959
Totally shameless.

07:47.041 --> 07:49.083
Okay, hon,
let's go meet those reporters.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.125
What are you gonna tell them?

07:50.208 --> 07:53.208
- I owe it all to Beauty by Vern.
- Attagirl.

07:59.709 --> 08:02.875
- Oh, Zach, what are you doing here?
- I came to support you.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.792
Oh. Okay, why don't you support me
from the lobby?

08:05.875 --> 08:08.583
I have some networking to do.
My girl just won the pageant.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.208
Oh, yeah, I know. And you're welcome.

08:13.750 --> 08:14.792
What did you do?

08:14.875 --> 08:18.083
Don't worry, I paid the judges in cash.
There's no paper trail.

08:18.166 --> 08:20.166
You bribed the judges?

08:20.250 --> 08:22.750
Gabrielle, why are we fighting?
We should be celebrating.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.041
I got a limo outside,
a bottle of chilled Cristal.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.583
Come on, let's go. Let's party.

08:26.667 --> 08:30.291
Listen to me, you pimply psychopath.
You and I are never going to "party."

08:30.375 --> 08:33.250
In fact, the only reason we're even
gonna be in the same room again

08:33.333 --> 08:37.500
is if you strangle a cheerleader
and I wind up on the jury.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.959
God, I love it when we banter.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.625
Hello, Alma.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.291
Orson.

08:51.375 --> 08:53.792
Oh, I let myself in.
I hope you don't mind.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.417
Not at all.

08:56.542 --> 08:59.709
- You seem very cheerful.
- Oh, I am.

08:59.792 --> 09:03.041
'Cause the game's over and you lost.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.625
I told you what I'd do
if you pushed me away.

09:05.709 --> 09:09.625
Well, I'm afraid that threat
no longer has any teeth in it.

09:11.000 --> 09:15.291
Yes, your mother told me
about Bree's little discovery.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.166
What did you do with Monique's teeth?

09:17.250 --> 09:20.583
Maybe I threw them away.
Maybe I hid them here.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.333
You might find them
if the police don't find them first.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.542
Oh, I don't think
you'll bring the police into this.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.208
Well, neither will you, now.

09:29.959 --> 09:31.250
We're done.

09:31.333 --> 09:34.917
Why don't you do us all a favour
and go away?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.083
- You shouldn't treat me this way.
- Don't bother crying.

09:38.166 --> 09:41.208
Tears might've worked when we
were married, after you lost the baby.

09:41.291 --> 09:44.625
- They won't work now.
- We should have kept trying.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.333
If we'd had a child,
we'd still be together.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.458
I know. That's why I stopped trying.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.750
Goodbye, Alma.

10:02.583 --> 10:07.458
Well, here's some sucky news.
Ken just quit.

10:07.542 --> 10:11.041
- Your new manager? No.
- Yeah. So I'm screwed.

10:11.125 --> 10:12.750
I'm gonna have to drop out
of the street fair.

10:12.834 --> 10:17.208
Tom, no, you can't. You can't.
The pizzeria opens in a week.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.959
And that street fair
is the best advertising we're gonna get.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.333
I know, but I can't work it alone.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.625
Well, you know, hire someone else.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.709
Well, there's no time for that.

10:26.792 --> 10:31.333
The future of the restaurant is at stake.
It is time to get creative.

10:31.417 --> 10:35.000
Well, I do have one option,
but it would require some sacrifice.

10:35.083 --> 10:38.917
- Well, whatever it is gonna take.
- You could help me.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.417
What? No. Look, I'm wearing makeup.
I am holding a briefcase.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.417
- What does this suggest to you?
- You could call in sick.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.834
I can't call in sick
after eight weeks of sick leave.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.750
Especially when I've been fine
for three of them.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.417
Oh, crap. That's Ed.

10:57.542 --> 10:59.417
Lynette. Lynette, please.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.709
You're the one who said
that we need the street fair.

11:01.792 --> 11:06.041
My boss is waiting for me
outside in his car.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.333
What am I supposed to do?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.750
It's time to get creative.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.166
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.250
Hey, guys.

11:22.333 --> 11:25.625
Boy, didn't expect you
to still be wearing a sling.

11:25.709 --> 11:29.875
Yeah, it heals a little slower
when the bullet's still in there.

11:29.959 --> 11:33.333
- Oh, they couldn't get it out?
- No, it's too close.

11:33.417 --> 11:34.750
To what?

11:35.959 --> 11:38.417
- Everything.
- God, I'm so sorry.

11:40.458 --> 11:45.542
- Hey, you got a little cereal right...
- Cereal? I didn't have any...

11:45.625 --> 11:47.625
Oh, I know what that is.

11:47.709 --> 11:52.208
I get nauseous from the pain,
so that's just a little residual vomit.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.041
Lynette, you sure you're ready
to come back to work?

11:56.125 --> 11:58.959
Yeah, don't be silly. I'm fine.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.959
Come on, let's go sell some toothpaste.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.000
All righty, let's go.

12:06.834 --> 12:09.458
- Oh! Oh, son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry!

12:09.542 --> 12:11.417
- Don't touch me, okay?
- Anything we can do?

12:11.500 --> 12:14.083
My pills! My pain pills.
They're in my bag.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.000
Oh! Oh! My pills!

12:18.083 --> 12:21.959
I need my pills
and now they're all dirty!

12:25.625 --> 12:28.917
See you next week.
Thanks for understanding.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.875
Hey, looks like an interesting book.
What's it about?

12:39.500 --> 12:41.750
- Never mind. I'll wait for the movie.
- What's eating you?

12:41.834 --> 12:45.375
Those two guys you saved me from?
I know you paid them to attack me.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.000
That's a lie.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.709
Oh, hey!

12:48.792 --> 12:50.375
You wanna take a minute
to reconsider that?

12:50.458 --> 12:53.583
Okay. Okay, I needed a favour
and I wanted you to owe me.

12:55.458 --> 12:57.709
What favour?

12:57.792 --> 13:00.542
- You sure you wanna get into this now?
- Yeah.

13:00.625 --> 13:04.250
Okay. You remember my son, Zach?

13:04.375 --> 13:06.667
Vaguely. Why?

13:06.750 --> 13:09.750
Turns out you and I share
more than a cellblock.

13:20.375 --> 13:23.583
Hello, Bree. May I come in?

13:23.667 --> 13:25.917
What's a garden without a snake?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.959
I realise I'm not your favourite person,

13:29.041 --> 13:32.917
but I thought you should know
why Alma's moved here.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.250
She wants Orson back.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.458
Thanks for the heads up.
Now off you go.

13:38.542 --> 13:41.583
Orson and I may have our spats,

13:41.667 --> 13:47.041
but I'm still deeply concerned
about the state of his soul.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.834
Adultery is a sin.

13:48.917 --> 13:52.792
I wouldn't worry about Orson's soul.
He won't be sleeping with Alma.

13:53.750 --> 13:59.542
When I said adultery,
I wasn't referring to Orson and Alma.

13:59.625 --> 14:02.458
I meant Orson and you.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.417
- Excuse me?
- Our church doesn't accept divorce.

14:06.500 --> 14:10.083
In the eyes of God,
you're the other woman.

14:10.166 --> 14:14.667
I'm sure you don't see it that way
but Alma and I do.

14:15.458 --> 14:17.375
And Orson's beginning to.

14:22.250 --> 14:25.709
- Are those shoes suede?
- Yes. Why?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.625
No reason.

14:38.083 --> 14:41.291
Why the hell didn't anybody tell me
I had a son?

14:41.375 --> 14:42.583
You'd just come out of a coma.

14:42.667 --> 14:45.500
They probably figured
you had enough on your plate.

14:46.375 --> 14:49.917
- Why are you telling me now?
- Zach and I haven't spoken in months.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.208
Every time I've tried to contact him,
he won't return the calls.

14:53.291 --> 14:57.083
I don't know what you expect me to do.
I barely remember the kid.

14:57.166 --> 14:59.208
Yes, but he remembers you.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.417
And I think if you reach out to him,
he'll talk to you.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.583
Zach is all I have left in the world.

15:06.667 --> 15:10.333
Through everything that's happened,
I've never stopped loving him.

15:10.417 --> 15:14.166
Can you please get him
to come down here and see me?

15:16.792 --> 15:19.083
That's one hell of a favour.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.750
Man, you got some nerve.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.750
I know. It's kind of what got me in here.

15:28.709 --> 15:31.166
- Is it Gabby's birthday?
- No.

15:31.250 --> 15:34.375
- They're probably from Zach Young.
- What?

15:34.458 --> 15:35.792
You haven't heard?

15:35.875 --> 15:38.625
He has been begging Gabby
to go on a date with him.

15:38.709 --> 15:42.792
He's been sending her all sorts of stuff
to bribe her, even a diamond bracelet.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.458
Zach Young? Our Zach Young?

15:45.542 --> 15:46.834
How does he afford diamonds?

15:46.917 --> 15:49.041
His grandfather left him all that money.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.959
Yeah, I thought it was in a trust
and he couldn't touch it.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.959
Until he turned 18,
which was a month ago.

15:54.500 --> 15:55.625
Wow.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.208
So Zach Young is loaded, huh?

16:00.291 --> 16:02.625
- No. Absolutely not.
- Oh, come on.

16:02.709 --> 16:05.875
Mike needs a great lawyer.
Zach can afford a great lawyer.

16:05.959 --> 16:08.667
I don't care.
I'm not going out with Zach Young.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.208
It's one little date.

16:10.291 --> 16:13.041
You wouldn't even let
your own daughter go out with him.

16:13.125 --> 16:14.583
You said he was a psycho.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.583
He's matured, to the tune of $1 billion.

16:17.667 --> 16:19.709
Please do this, for Mike.

16:19.792 --> 16:22.750
Susan, do you know what your
obsession with Mike has cost you?

16:22.834 --> 16:25.250
First you piss off Bree and then Ian.

16:25.333 --> 16:27.500
And now you're pimping me out
to a teenager.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.250
Okay, I deserve the pimping remark.

16:29.333 --> 16:32.750
But let's not pretend that,
you know, we're above teenagers.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.000
Gabby, you're all I've got.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.166
- Fine. I'll do it.
- Thank you.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.291
This is a noble thing you're doing.

16:45.375 --> 16:48.208
How can you be so sure
Zach's gonna go along with this?

16:48.291 --> 16:52.083
Because he's a great kid,
and he's gonna wanna help Mike.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.291
And you're not gonna be wearing a bra
when you ask him out.

17:10.375 --> 17:14.583
Can you guys just take five, please?
Gabrielle, what are you doing here?

17:14.667 --> 17:17.291
Wow. You have your own
recording studio in your house?

17:17.375 --> 17:20.333
Yeah. I needed a place
to lay some tracks with my band.

17:20.417 --> 17:22.208
You see that guy?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.375
He used to tour with
the Doobie Brothers.

17:24.458 --> 17:26.125
How wild is that?

17:27.458 --> 17:30.208
Not as wild as what I'm about to say.

17:32.166 --> 17:35.959
- You can take me to dinner.
- Seriously? Awesome.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.959
Yeah. Here's how it's gonna work.

17:38.041 --> 17:41.083
We drive to the restaurant separately,
we will not have dessert,

17:41.166 --> 17:44.709
and under no circumstances
will you touch me. <i>Capisce?</i>

17:45.792 --> 17:47.125
- Okay.
- Great.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.583
In order for this magical night to occur,

17:49.667 --> 17:51.125
you're gonna need
to help Mike Delfino.

17:51.208 --> 17:55.875
- Mike? What happened?
- He's in jail, for murder.

17:55.959 --> 17:57.250
But Susan swears he's innocent,

17:57.333 --> 17:59.041
and she wants you to get him
a good lawyer.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.458
All right. We have a deal?

18:02.500 --> 18:03.583
No.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.667
- No?
- I would love to help Mike.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.959
It's just that
if I'm paying for a lawyer, you know,

18:11.041 --> 18:13.750
I would like to have
more than just one meal with you.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.625
I'd like to have a whole day.

18:15.709 --> 18:19.750
- A whole day?
- Yeah. Here's how it's gonna work.

18:19.834 --> 18:22.417
There's gonna be three meals,
with dessert,

18:22.500 --> 18:27.417
activities of my choosing
and a good night kiss.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.417
- Now do we have a deal?
- Not quite.

18:31.500 --> 18:34.750
The day starts with lunch,
and that kiss, off the table.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.625
Did they set bail for Mike?

18:41.709 --> 18:44.333
You know,
'cause I could throw that in, too.

18:44.417 --> 18:47.709
-$1 million.
- It's no biggie.

18:47.792 --> 18:50.625
One call to my accountant
and Mike's a free man.

18:52.792 --> 18:55.417
Or do you wanna tell Susan
that Mike's gonna stay in jail

18:55.500 --> 18:58.041
because you wouldn't kiss me?

18:59.041 --> 19:01.375
Okay, deal, you little skunk.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.792
Here you go,
you can come back for seconds.

19:05.875 --> 19:09.458
- Our famous pepperoni pizza.
- Here's another Canadian bacon.

19:09.542 --> 19:13.000
Great. Guess what?
Our line is the biggest one at the fair.

19:13.083 --> 19:14.417
I counted.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
- You know what I'm starting to think?
- What?

19:16.583 --> 19:20.709
This restaurant
is gonna be a big, fat hit.

19:20.792 --> 19:21.959
- There you go.
- Great.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.291
Can I talk to you about something?

19:34.625 --> 19:36.583
I think you hurt Lynette's feelings

19:36.667 --> 19:39.709
when you refused to go
to the street fair with her.

19:40.542 --> 19:43.166
She's gonna start to think
you don't like her.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.083
You don't want that, do you?

19:47.375 --> 19:48.709
Doorbell.

19:55.917 --> 19:58.917
Someone should be left
on a hillside to rot.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:02.166 --> 20:05.709
I'm Ed Ferrara, Lynette's boss.
Is she around?

20:05.792 --> 20:10.125
- Well, actually, she's at the doctor's.
- Oh.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.917
- Yeah. Well, could you give her this?
- Oh, sure.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.208
And tell her to get well.

20:14.291 --> 20:17.375
She doesn't need to come back to work
till she's good and ready.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.208
- I will make sure she gets this.
- Okay.

20:25.250 --> 20:27.250
Excuse me, mister?

20:27.333 --> 20:30.875
I just wanted to tell you our
babysitter gets mixed up sometimes.

20:32.917 --> 20:35.333
Lynette's not at the doctor's.

20:35.417 --> 20:38.041
- She's not?
- Nope.

20:38.125 --> 20:40.625
Well, where is she?

20:43.583 --> 20:47.458
- Excuse me. Hey.
- Try some of that. Hey!

20:47.542 --> 20:49.083
- Load me up again, would you?
- Yeah.

20:49.166 --> 20:52.583
I'm gonna go poach some customers
from that sausage-on-a-stick guy.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.000
Oh, I love it when you're ruthless.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.583
Scavo's Pizzeria!

20:57.667 --> 21:00.500
Try the smoked chicken
and sun-dried tomato.

21:00.583 --> 21:03.041
- Oh.
- This crust is fantastic.

21:03.125 --> 21:05.583
It's cornmeal. That's the secret.

21:09.166 --> 21:13.291
- It's not your only secret, is it,
Lynette? -Hi, Ed.

21:13.375 --> 21:15.458
How's the arm?

21:19.291 --> 21:20.792
On the mend.

21:20.875 --> 21:23.500
I'm gonna be there
bright and early Monday morning.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.417
Don't bother. You're fired.

21:25.500 --> 21:28.250
Wait, Ed. Ed, please don't go.

21:28.333 --> 21:31.250
Yes, I lied, and that was wrong,
but my husband needed my help.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.625
I need your help.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.917
You've been gone eight weeks,
with pay,

21:35.000 --> 21:36.417
while the company's been falling apart.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.041
And now you pull this on me?

21:38.125 --> 21:40.583
Like I said, really, really wrong,
but if you take me back,

21:40.667 --> 21:43.125
I swear, I will give you 100%.

21:44.917 --> 21:48.667
So if we have to work late,
you're gonna do it.

21:49.792 --> 21:53.417
If I ask you to miss
your kid's baseball game,

21:53.500 --> 21:56.250
you're gonna say, "No problem, Ed."

21:57.458 --> 21:59.166
You got it, Ed.

21:59.250 --> 22:01.500
Good. I'll see you Monday.

22:19.041 --> 22:22.500
Hi, it's me. Listen, we have to talk.

22:22.583 --> 22:25.792
Ian, I'm sorry, too.
We've gotta stop fighting like this.

22:25.875 --> 22:30.083
Susan, Jane's doctor called me.
She's taken a bad turn.

22:30.959 --> 22:32.750
Oh, Ian.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.250
I'm on the next flight out,
but it's not for a few hours,

22:35.333 --> 22:36.959
and Jane's parents are in Rome.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.417
Would you go to the hospital for me?

22:40.917 --> 22:43.375
- The hospital?
- Well, I know it's a lot to ask.

22:43.458 --> 22:47.500
But if something should happen, I...
Well, I don't want her to be alone.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.291
Oh, I'm stuffed.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.500
I can't believe you talked me
into that crème brûlée.

22:59.583 --> 23:02.458
Oh, don't feel guilty. I'm sure
we burned it off on the dance floor.

23:02.542 --> 23:05.959
I know. You're such a good dancer.
Where'd you learn how to salsa?

23:06.041 --> 23:09.041
I've been taking lessons
'cause I knew it was your favourite.

23:09.125 --> 23:11.750
- When did I say that?
<i>- Cosmo, </i>'98.

23:11.834 --> 23:14.166
And I knew you liked that Merlot
from your <i>Vogue </i>interview.

23:14.250 --> 23:17.375
You researched me? That's sweet.

23:17.458 --> 23:20.083
In a stalkery kind of way.

23:21.417 --> 23:25.917
Thanks again
for a surprisingly enjoyable night.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.291
See you around.

23:28.375 --> 23:29.625
Gabby.

23:32.667 --> 23:35.375
Oh, right, the kiss.

23:35.458 --> 23:38.583
Sorry. Didn't mean to welsh on you.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.959
All right, pucker up.

23:55.875 --> 23:59.166
- What the hell are you doing?
- But you said I could kiss you.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.583
Yes, my lips, not my oesophagus.

24:01.667 --> 24:04.417
For your information, I have been told
I'm a very good kisser, all right?

24:04.500 --> 24:05.667
By who?

24:05.750 --> 24:08.583
The same girl that taught you to use
your tongue like a windshield wiper?

24:08.667 --> 24:10.834
No, by women.
Women with lots of experience,

24:10.917 --> 24:13.291
and every single one of them
said that I was a great kisser.

24:13.375 --> 24:16.250
How much did you pay them
to say that?

24:20.166 --> 24:22.083
No!

24:22.166 --> 24:24.667
- You've paid women for...
- It's none of your business, all right?

24:24.750 --> 24:26.834
- It's none of your business.
- Yes, it is.

24:26.917 --> 24:28.333
You just vacuumed my tonsils.

24:28.417 --> 24:30.667
I deserve to know
where that mouth has been.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.709
You know what? I'm sorry. I gotta go.

24:32.792 --> 24:36.542
Zach. Zach, I'm not mad. Okay?

24:36.625 --> 24:39.959
I'm just a little grossed out, that's all.

24:48.709 --> 24:52.458
You heard me. You heard me, all right?
Read my lips. Just go, all right? Go!

24:52.542 --> 24:55.542
- You've got no right to be here.
- All right.

24:57.750 --> 25:00.792
What, another one?
You organ-donor people are vultures.

25:00.875 --> 25:05.709
No, actually, I'm a friend of Ian's.
He asked me to come, for Jane.

25:07.458 --> 25:11.458
You're the girlfriend. All right.
That's okay, then. Come on in.

25:18.792 --> 25:22.875
So, Erica, you were fighting
with that guy when I came in.

25:22.959 --> 25:27.041
Have you had a lot of those
organ-donor people around today?

25:27.125 --> 25:30.417
Oh, that wasn't about that.
No, that was Ted.

25:32.375 --> 25:35.875
What, Ian never told you
about Jane and Ted?

25:35.959 --> 25:39.166
- No. What about them?
- Nothing.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.917
Forget I mentioned it. It is not my place.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.500
- What?
- They had an affair.

25:45.583 --> 25:49.083
Jane cheated on Ian? When was this?

25:49.166 --> 25:54.083
I hate to dish my best friend
on her deathbed.

25:54.166 --> 25:58.208
But gossip was the foundation
of our relationship, so...

25:58.959 --> 26:01.291
It was five years ago.

26:01.375 --> 26:05.709
Ian was travelling a lot on business.
Jane was lonely and along came Ted.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.250
I'm just stunned.

26:12.875 --> 26:16.917
- So, I guess they worked it out, right?
- Well, Ian took her back.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.291
But if you're asking,
"Did he ever really trust her again?"

26:19.375 --> 26:21.041
I don't think so.

26:21.750 --> 26:23.208
Poor Ian.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.291
You don't know the half of it.

26:26.375 --> 26:30.000
I mean, to be betrayed
by somebody you love that much,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.166
you're just never the same.

26:44.125 --> 26:46.375
Hey. What are you doing here?

26:46.458 --> 26:49.166
Word on the street is
you're looking for a manager.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.625
Yeah.

26:51.166 --> 26:53.291
Here's my application.

26:53.375 --> 26:57.500
- I thought Ed took you back.
- He did. I told him I wasn't interested.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.041
What?

27:00.417 --> 27:05.000
- You're quitting?
- I had so much fun at the fair today.

27:05.083 --> 27:08.583
Working with you on something
that was all ours.

27:11.041 --> 27:14.875
- I want every day to be like that.
- Honey, so do I.

27:14.959 --> 27:16.291
Are you sure?

27:16.375 --> 27:19.041
I mean, your career's
always meant so much to you.

27:20.750 --> 27:22.625
When I got shot
and I was lying there bleeding,

27:22.709 --> 27:26.333
I wasn't thinking, "God,
I'm really gonna miss advertising."

27:27.750 --> 27:32.083
I think this could be the best thing
that's ever happened to our family.

27:32.166 --> 27:36.208
We can make our own hours.
We'll be together more.

27:36.291 --> 27:39.166
And, yes, the money
is gonna be a little tight,

27:39.250 --> 27:42.333
but I think this place
could be a gold mine.

27:44.542 --> 27:47.542
In that case, you're hired.

27:49.458 --> 27:52.834
You do, of course, realise
you have to sleep with the boss.

27:52.917 --> 27:54.458
I can do that.

27:55.750 --> 27:56.917
Okay.

28:00.917 --> 28:04.542
Whoa. It's a little soon
to be gunning for a promotion.

28:10.500 --> 28:13.125
- Your mother not home yet?
- I haven't seen her.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.792
Hello?

28:18.917 --> 28:20.542
What is it now?

28:22.834 --> 28:26.709
Alma did what?
No, no. I'll be right over.

28:27.959 --> 28:30.333
Hey, what did Alma do?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.792
I just thank the Lord
I got here when I did.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.959
Why didn't you call an ambulance?

28:43.041 --> 28:46.125
I thought it best for all concerned
to keep this quiet.

28:46.208 --> 28:48.875
By the way, she left a note.

28:58.875 --> 29:01.291
She only did this to upset me.

29:01.458 --> 29:03.083
She knows my history.

29:03.166 --> 29:05.917
She knows exactly
what buttons to push.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.250
Orson, calm down.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.625
Here.

29:16.834 --> 29:18.583
Our marriage is over.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.291
I will not submit to emotional blackmail.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.583
Are you all right?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.709
I feel dizzy.

29:29.792 --> 29:34.166
Then, perhaps, you should just sit.

29:42.333 --> 29:43.625
My God.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.083
Did you poison me?

29:48.166 --> 29:50.750
And kill my only child?

29:50.834 --> 29:53.083
You see how he talks to me?

29:55.625 --> 29:58.291
It's my fault. I upset him.

30:02.250 --> 30:05.834
Sorry about all this.
I just needed to get your attention.

30:08.917 --> 30:10.041
Why?

30:11.458 --> 30:13.041
What do you want?

30:13.125 --> 30:15.500
What every mother wants, dear.

30:16.709 --> 30:18.667
A grandchild.

30:38.417 --> 30:42.125
Well, why don't I give you two
some privacy?

30:42.208 --> 30:44.333
Thank you, Mother Hodge.

30:46.625 --> 30:48.083
You mustn't struggle.

30:49.291 --> 30:52.333
I want this baby to be born of love.

30:55.542 --> 30:58.125
I've been injecting myself

30:58.208 --> 31:00.542
with hormones

31:00.625 --> 31:02.583
to improve our chances.

31:04.375 --> 31:08.750
You wait and see.
This is gonna fix everything.

31:08.834 --> 31:13.041
- You're crazy.
- Crazy for you, mister.

31:13.125 --> 31:17.417
- I won't. You can't make me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.125
That drink had two kinds of pills in it.

31:20.208 --> 31:22.250
One to put you to sleep,

31:22.333 --> 31:26.917
and one to keep the part of you I need
nice and perky.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.583
Now, how about a little music?

31:46.166 --> 31:48.834
The doctor was just here,
he said her blood pressure's dropping.

31:48.875 --> 31:52.333
She could go any time.
I gotta go call her parents.

32:06.125 --> 32:08.667
- Hi.
- It's me. We just took off.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.458
I'll be there in about six hours.

32:10.542 --> 32:15.000
Sweetie, I don't think
she's gonna make it that long.

32:15.917 --> 32:17.667
Don't tell me that.

32:17.750 --> 32:21.375
You've done everything you could.
She knows that you love her.

32:21.458 --> 32:24.500
Well, it's just there's things
I've got to say to her.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.834
I've carried around
so much anger about something

32:26.917 --> 32:28.333
that doesn't mean anything now.

32:28.417 --> 32:30.417
I need her to know that.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.583
I'm gonna put the phone
up to Jane's ear,

32:34.667 --> 32:38.083
and you can tell her
whatever you need to, okay?

32:39.875 --> 32:41.166
Okay.

32:48.041 --> 32:50.000
Hello, Jane, darling. It's Ian.

32:51.125 --> 32:54.917
<i>I never imagined I'd have to say</i>
<i>goodbye to you like this.</i>

32:55.000 --> 32:57.500
<i>There's so much I want to say.</i>

33:11.250 --> 33:13.458
You play that pretty well.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.750
What are you doing here?

33:17.709 --> 33:19.875
I had a good time tonight.

33:19.959 --> 33:24.208
- But I hated the way it ended.
- Yeah, me, too.

33:26.125 --> 33:31.917
- Gabby, about those women...
- Forget about it.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.333
Give a horny kid a couple million bucks
and the Yellow Pages,

33:34.417 --> 33:36.083
and stuff is gonna happen.

33:36.166 --> 33:40.417
It's not just them.
I'm paying everyone that I know.

33:42.166 --> 33:45.166
Those guys in my band,
they're not my friends.

33:45.250 --> 33:47.291
I'm hiring them to hang out with me.

33:47.375 --> 33:51.333
So stop doing it. Stop buying people.

33:51.417 --> 33:54.333
Yeah, right.
And then I'd have no one at all.

33:56.375 --> 33:58.083
That's not true.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.333
You'd have me.

34:02.917 --> 34:07.125
As a friend.
A friend friend, not a girlfriend.

34:07.208 --> 34:11.000
I really cannot overstress that.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.166
Come on.

34:13.250 --> 34:16.792
Why do you wanna be my friend?
We have zero in common.

34:16.917 --> 34:18.458
I don't know.

34:20.083 --> 34:23.583
Maybe it's because
I think we're both adrift.

34:25.625 --> 34:29.875
It'd just be nice to have a pal
who gets what I'm going through.

34:36.250 --> 34:38.917
Why don't you play me
something you wrote?

34:39.000 --> 34:41.834
Yeah? Can I sing, too?

34:41.917 --> 34:44.875
- Sure. Why not?
- All right.

34:44.959 --> 34:48.250
<i>Gabby, sweet Gabby...</i>

34:48.333 --> 34:51.166
Whoa.
Why don't you just hum it, okay?

34:55.083 --> 34:56.959
Hi.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.750
Sorry, my book club ran late.

34:59.834 --> 35:02.458
- Didn't Orson make you dinner?
- Oh, no.

35:02.542 --> 35:06.166
He's been over at Alma's.
He's been there for a few hours now.

35:24.667 --> 35:26.792
What the hell is this?

35:28.041 --> 35:31.000
Oh, Bree, I'm so sorry
you had to find out this way.

35:31.083 --> 35:33.792
Not as sorry as you are gonna be.

35:33.875 --> 35:35.542
Orson, get up!

35:35.625 --> 35:37.417
Leave him alone.
He wants to be with me now.

35:37.500 --> 35:41.917
Orson, I have caught you cheating.
At least have the courtesy to wake up.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.917
Oh, for God sakes!

35:48.166 --> 35:49.625
Orson.

35:50.625 --> 35:51.875
Orson.

35:54.166 --> 35:56.709
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.

35:56.792 --> 35:58.000
You know men.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.166
The minute it's over, wham,
off to dreamland.

36:00.250 --> 36:02.750
He's not sleeping. He's out cold.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.375
Oh, I knew it.

36:11.458 --> 36:14.291
These are sleeping pills
and these are...

36:15.959 --> 36:17.500
Oh, my God.

36:22.250 --> 36:25.959
- You raped my husband.
- We made love.

36:26.041 --> 36:28.625
And when our baby's born,
he's gonna come back to me.

36:28.709 --> 36:30.291
- Baby?
- It's true.

36:30.375 --> 36:34.083
- I could be expecting right now.
- Were you expecting this?

36:44.166 --> 36:48.542
Andrew, I need you
to come over here right away

36:50.709 --> 36:52.875
and bring the wheelbarrow.

37:15.250 --> 37:16.333
Hi.

37:18.250 --> 37:20.917
Do you remember me?

37:22.500 --> 37:25.041
No. No, not really.

37:28.625 --> 37:30.417
But I know who you are.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.667
Okay, good.

37:40.041 --> 37:43.542
What you did, I'm really grateful.

37:44.750 --> 37:46.375
It's cool.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.500
So, if you need anything else,
I guess, just let me know.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.291
Well, I do need something

38:04.417 --> 38:06.291
but it's not for me.

38:11.583 --> 38:15.750
So, how you doing?
You look terrific. Really mature.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.083
Your mother would be proud.

38:19.125 --> 38:20.375
Thanks.

38:20.458 --> 38:23.000
I've really missed you a lot.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.750
And I'm sorry for...

38:26.750 --> 38:28.458
For everything.

38:28.542 --> 38:32.750
I hope you can forgive me.
I want us to be friends.

38:32.834 --> 38:35.417
And that's the only reason
you wanted to see me, right?

38:35.500 --> 38:39.208
- So we could be friends?
- Yes.

38:39.291 --> 38:40.750
Okay.

38:41.709 --> 38:43.208
That's great.

38:43.291 --> 38:44.792
That's fine.

38:49.208 --> 38:52.750
- Well, there is one other thing.
- Oh, yeah.

38:52.834 --> 38:56.041
It's just Felicia Tillman faked her death.

38:56.125 --> 38:59.125
She's still out there.
You and I, we both know that.

38:59.208 --> 39:04.709
If you gave or lent me some money,
I could hire someone to track her down.

39:04.792 --> 39:06.125
And then I could get out of here,

39:06.208 --> 39:08.917
and you and I could pick up
where we left off.

39:11.083 --> 39:12.291
Okay.

39:14.417 --> 39:16.667
You asked me how I was doing?

39:16.750 --> 39:19.166
I'm actually doing great.

39:19.250 --> 39:23.000
I've got the hottest, most amazing
girlfriend in the entire world,

39:23.083 --> 39:24.917
and I am gonna marry that woman.

39:25.000 --> 39:27.417
I'm gonna buy her
everything she wants.

39:28.959 --> 39:34.291
So I have got to learn to say no
when people ask me for money

39:34.375 --> 39:37.291
because I got a future wife
to think about.

39:38.417 --> 39:41.208
She's got really expensive taste.

39:45.667 --> 39:50.875
I do forgive you, though, Paul.

40:03.583 --> 40:07.583
- Hey, Susan.
- Hey. You're back.

40:07.667 --> 40:10.417
Yeah, Zach Young posted my bail.

40:10.500 --> 40:14.000
But I'm guessing
you had something to do with it.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.375
Maybe a little.

40:15.458 --> 40:20.125
Is there any way that I can thank you
for everything you've done?

40:21.458 --> 40:24.083
- Actually, yeah, there is.
- Good, good.

40:24.166 --> 40:25.750
Just tell me.

40:28.417 --> 40:30.291
I can't see you any more.

40:30.375 --> 40:32.959
I want you to understand,
it doesn't have anything to do with you,

40:33.041 --> 40:34.834
it's just...

40:43.709 --> 40:45.166
It's okay.

40:46.375 --> 40:47.959
I think I get it.

40:54.917 --> 40:56.667
Well, I...

40:56.750 --> 40:59.166
I should probably go.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.834
Bye. Good luck with everything.

41:01.917 --> 41:04.166
Good luck to you and Ian.

41:35.959 --> 41:39.542
<i>Yes, it can happen so quickly.</i>

41:39.625 --> 41:43.125
<i>Life, as we know it,</i>
<i>can change in the blink of an eye.</i>

41:46.166 --> 41:48.667
<i>Unlikely friendships can blossom.</i>

41:53.166 --> 41:56.208
<i>Important careers can be tossed aside.</i>

42:00.375 --> 42:03.500
<i>A long-lost hope can be rekindled.</i>

42:05.500 --> 42:10.250
<i>Still, we should be grateful</i>
<i>for whatever changes life throws at us.</i>

42:11.834 --> 42:15.208
<i>Because all too soon,</i>
<i>the day will come</i>

42:17.291 --> 42:20.041
<i>when there are no changes left.</i>
