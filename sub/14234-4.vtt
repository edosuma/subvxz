We need to find them.

12:06.234 --> 12:09.937

12:10.005 --> 12:14.276
Leila knew the girl
who was going to kill her.

12:14.343 --> 12:17.680
Her name was vicky.

12:17.747 --> 12:19.248
That's all I know.

12:22.151 --> 12:26.423

mr. Buchanan.

12:31.662 --> 12:33.697
How long have you
been standing there?

12:33.765 --> 12:34.765
- Long enough to know

12:34.833 --> 12:36.634
You've been keeping information
from me.

12:36.702 --> 12:38.903
Why wasn't I told you were
interviewing the pilot?

12:38.971 --> 12:40.805

You're not running
the investigation

about that.

- Oh, yes, I remember
your insinuation quite clearly.

12:49.282 --> 12:52.918
And I chose
not to be offended by it.

12:52.986 --> 12:56.856
- That's all you have
to say?

12:56.924 --> 12:59.927
- The president and I
have our differences.

12:59.995 --> 13:01.929
But the idea of me having
anything to do

13:01.997 --> 13:04.533
With trying to kill him...

13:04.601 --> 13:07.337
Is absurd.

13:07.405 --> 13:11.042
If only because that would
put you in charge.

13:17.851 --> 13:20.051
- There was this little girl.

13:20.118 --> 13:22.449
She couldn't have been
much older than david.

13:22.517 --> 13:26.218

And then today,
there she was.

13:34.520 --> 13:36.450
She was standing there
right in front of me.

13:36.518 --> 13:40.646
- Hmm. It's like a miracle.
- It's not a miracle.

13:40.714 --> 13:42.112
It's not a miracle.

13:42.180 --> 13:44.145
It's something else
that sophia's people can do

13:44.213 --> 13:46.311
That we just don't
understand.

13:46.377 --> 13:48.309
- Elias, it's natural
for you to question this.

13:48.376 --> 13:50.710
You feel betrayed.

the plane out of the sky

14:23.880 --> 14:25.583

14:25.651 --> 14:28.890

I should thank you.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.064

14:55.383 --> 14:56.516

14:56.584 --> 14:58.351

14:58.419 --> 15:00.286
That we were both being honest
with each other.

15:00.354 --> 15:04.022

24:42.005 --> 24:43.486
We have absolutely nothing
in common.

24:43.554 --> 24:45.319
- Come here.
Where are you going?

24:45.386 --> 24:47.417
This way. Come on.

24:49.764 --> 24:51.279
- Oh, thank you.

24:51.347 --> 24:53.043
It's all so delicious.

24:53.111 --> 24:54.941
- That's because I had nothing
to do with it.

24:55.009 --> 24:58.570
- Ha. I managed to marry
a cuban girl who doesn't cook.

24:58.638 --> 25:00.701
- So how did you two meet?

25:00.769 --> 25:03.132
- Ah.
- Our mothers set us up.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.678
- Ah. They came over together
from cuba

25:05.746 --> 25:07.328
As teenagers on the same
fishing boat.

25:07.377 --> 25:08.358
- Yes.

25:08.426 --> 25:10.274
- My mom was pregnant
and very alone.

25:10.323 --> 25:13.188
And christina's mom
took care of her

25:13.237 --> 25:14.318
During the trip.

25:14.386 --> 25:16.167
- Then they lost touch
when they got to miami.

25:16.216 --> 25:17.665
But then 30 years lar,

25:17.733 --> 25:19.863
They're standing in line
for bocaditos

25:19.931 --> 25:22.242
At la rosa bakery
and, uh...

25:22.310 --> 25:24.373
- And here we are.
[laughter]

25:24.441 --> 25:26.204
- Amazing.

25:26.272 --> 25:29.551
A refugee comes
to this country pregnant,

25:29.619 --> 25:32.197
Poor, alone,
and a generation later,

25:32.265 --> 25:34.762
Her son is the president.

25:34.830 --> 25:37.857
This is why your country
is truly great.

25:37.925 --> 25:39.674
- I couldn't agree more.
- Mm-hmm.

25:39.741 --> 25:41.920
- So you understand
why I'm hopeful

25:41.988 --> 25:44.800
That you will welcome my people
the way that this country

25:44.868 --> 25:46.550
Lcomed yours.

25:46.599 --> 25:49.140
My dream is that one day
my people

25:49.208 --> 25:50.958
Will sit around a table
like this

25:51.026 --> 25:53.004
And tell
their immigration stories

25:53.072 --> 25:54.992
And it will seem
no more strange

25:55.059 --> 25:59.067
Than a tale of a fishing boat
from cuba.

26:06.844 --> 26:09.580
- I-I am sorry--I'm sorry
that it's come to this.

26:09.648 --> 26:11.950
- If you were so sorry,
you would start talking.

26:12.017 --> 26:16.588
Who made that call, sophia,
and how do I stop them?

26:16.655 --> 26:18.156
- You know that I can't--
- no, no, no.

26:18.224 --> 26:20.724
It's not that you can't.
You won't.

26:20.792 --> 26:24.227
You do exactly what you want,
no matter the consequences.

26:24.295 --> 26:25.830
Isn't that right?

26:25.898 --> 26:27.432
- You--
- isn't that right?

26:27.499 --> 26:30.367
- The plane.
The passengers.

26:30.435 --> 26:31.902
It's all you.
You're pulling the strings.

26:31.970 --> 26:34.372
- You're wrong.
I didn't condone any of this.

26:34.440 --> 26:40.144
- You had one of your own killed
because he was going to talk.

26:40.212 --> 26:46.216
What? Did you think
I'd never figure that out?

26:50.888 --> 26:53.089
Sophia...

26:55.894 --> 26:58.963
You call yourself
my friend.

26:59.031 --> 27:01.098
If there's anything true
to that,

27:01.166 --> 27:03.767
If there's anything
that's real that's left,

27:03.835 --> 27:06.436
Please...

27:06.504 --> 27:10.107
Tell me what you know.

27:12.176 --> 27:14.511
- His name is thomas.

27:14.579 --> 27:18.615
He is intelligent,

27:18.683 --> 27:21.918
Charismatic.

27:21.986 --> 27:25.922
A natural leader.

27:25.990 --> 27:27.824
But we've always had
different ideas

27:27.892 --> 27:33.129
About how to adapt
to our presence here.

27:33.197 --> 27:35.832
He is less patient.

27:35.900 --> 27:37.734
Impulsive.
- Where is he now?

27:37.802 --> 27:39.069
- I don't know.

27:39.136 --> 27:40.737
But whatever he's
asking you for,

27:40.805 --> 27:41.805
Give it to him.

27:41.872 --> 27:44.607
- Well, what he wants...

27:44.675 --> 27:46.476
Is you and the detainees.

27:46.544 --> 27:47.577
That's not going to happen.

27:47.645 --> 27:50.447
- Listen to me, elias,

27:50.514 --> 27:52.115
I know him better than anyone.

27:52.183 --> 27:56.353
You need to give him
what he wants.

27:56.420 --> 28:00.857
- Or what?
- I don't know.

28:00.925 --> 28:04.661
But please, for the safety
of your people,

28:04.728 --> 28:06.529
Do what he says.

28:32.557 --> 28:34.924
- [sniffs]

28:41.731 --> 28:44.533
- Suki, I want you to go
to ward one.

28:44.601 --> 28:47.270
Jake, go to ward three,
please.

29:14.173 --> 29:15.273
- I'm positive.

29:15.341 --> 29:17.675
I've never seen her before
in my life.

29:19.178 --> 29:21.446
- [scoffs] then why is she,
uh, paying for you

29:21.513 --> 29:22.881
To live here?

29:22.948 --> 29:25.950
- [scoffs] I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:26.018 --> 29:27.185
- Well--

29:27.252 --> 29:29.086
- Now, I have seen
your credentials, agent collier.

29:29.154 --> 29:30.955
But I don't believe
I've ever seen yours.

29:31.022 --> 29:33.891
Who are you?
- Agent walker.

29:33.959 --> 29:37.128
- Agent walker must've left
his badge in the car again.

29:37.196 --> 29:38.696
Can we talk for a sec?

29:44.069 --> 29:45.869
- What are you doing?
Lower the hammer on her.

29:45.937 --> 29:47.704
She's obviously lying.
- And so are we.

29:47.772 --> 29:49.039
If she figures out
we're not here

29:49.106 --> 29:50.173
On official fbi business,

29:50.241 --> 29:51.341
She's gonna stop talking.

29:51.408 --> 29:54.043
- So what do we do?

29:54.111 --> 29:56.345
- All right,
just wait outside.

29:56.413 --> 30:02.353
Let me handle this.

30:02.421 --> 30:05.690
Sorry about that.

30:05.758 --> 30:08.325
- I told you
I don't know this person.

30:08.393 --> 30:10.827
- [shuts door loudly]

30:10.894 --> 30:12.228
- Okay, I understand.

30:12.296 --> 30:14.930
So how is she paying
your rent?

30:14.998 --> 30:20.937
- She's not paying my rent.
I don't know her.

30:21.005 --> 30:24.074
[music box plays brief note]

30:29.949 --> 30:32.584
Here is the document
that agent walker

30:32.652 --> 30:34.086
Was referring to.

30:34.153 --> 30:36.754
If you look, it clearly states
that a laura roderick paid

30:36.822 --> 30:38.055
Last month's rent.

30:38.123 --> 30:41.458
- Well, uh, there must be
some kind of a mistake.

30:48.499 --> 30:54.103
- Hey. Is this yours?

30:54.170 --> 30:57.040
What's your name?
- Adam.

30:57.107 --> 31:00.210
- Hi, adam.
My name is sean.

31:00.277 --> 31:03.913
- Are you a friend
of my mommy's?

31:03.980 --> 31:07.450
- Um, yeah.

31:07.518 --> 31:13.122
Yeah, I am. I have a picture
of us, actually.

31:13.190 --> 31:15.391
That's your mommy, right?

31:15.458 --> 31:16.993
- You're lucky.

31:17.061 --> 31:20.330
Grandma says we can't keep
real pictures of her.

31:20.397 --> 31:26.135
Are you going to see her soon?
- I don't know. I hope so.

31:26.203 --> 31:28.137
- Can you take a picture
of me?

31:28.204 --> 31:30.239
Show her how big I got?

31:30.307 --> 31:34.643
- Sure. Yeah.

31:34.710 --> 31:37.912
Ready? Smile.

31:37.979 --> 31:40.314
[camera clicks]

31:40.382 --> 31:42.816
Got a good one.
- Can I see?

31:42.884 --> 31:47.221
- Sure.

31:47.289 --> 31:50.457
[chuckles]
all right.

31:50.525 --> 31:52.659
[beep]

31:52.726 --> 31:54.727
I'll show that to her.

31:54.794 --> 31:58.396
I just wanted to make sure
you got your music box back.

31:58.464 --> 32:00.165
It's nice to meet you, adam.

32:00.232 --> 32:03.103
- Nice meeting you.
- Good-bye.

32:03.170 --> 32:07.106
- I'm sorry
I couldn't help you.

32:07.174 --> 32:10.043
- Okay, what you're doing
is aiding and abetting a felon.

32:10.111 --> 32:13.046
That could land you in jail.

32:13.114 --> 32:15.482
- Please go.
- I know why you won't talk.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.652
You're vicky's mother.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.355
And you're trying to protect her
along with your grandson adam.

32:20.422 --> 32:22.623
He's fine.
He's playing in his bedroom.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.358
- Where's your daughter,
mrs. Larson?

32:24.426 --> 32:26.559
- Please, no one's supposed
to know--

32:26.627 --> 32:28.293
- Then stop playing games.

32:28.361 --> 32:30.395
Or child protective services
can determine whose custody

32:30.463 --> 32:31.496
He should be in.

32:31.564 --> 32:34.100
- I don't know
where my daughter is.

32:34.167 --> 32:35.768
She just contacts me
every few months

32:35.836 --> 32:36.969
To check up on adam.

32:37.037 --> 32:39.305
- Well, you must have some way
to reach her.

32:51.620 --> 32:54.089
- I'm only supposed to call this
in an emergency.

33:01.330 --> 33:04.700
- Please.

33:04.767 --> 33:09.104
Don't do this.

33:09.172 --> 33:11.873
Look, I know that this isn't
your choice.

33:11.941 --> 33:15.043
I know that somebody else
is telling you to do this.

33:15.111 --> 33:19.314
You don't have to listen
to them.

33:19.382 --> 33:22.784
- Actually, I do.

who you are.

- He's after me, he's coming--
- who's coming?

- I was kidnapped, and I--
and I just shot somebody.

34:46.362 --> 34:47.463
- You shot somebody.

34:47.531 --> 34:49.164
You were kidnapped,
and you shot somebody.

34:49.232 --> 34:50.299
- I shot somebody just now.

34:50.366 --> 34:51.667
- All right, fine.
Just calm down.

34:51.734 --> 34:53.568
- Calm down? Are you listening
to what I'm saying?

34:53.636 --> 34:55.804
- I am trying
to listen to you,

34:55.871 --> 34:57.138
But you're not
making sense.

34:57.206 --> 35:00.276
- I need to go with you.

Copy that, unit 7.

she was kidnapped.

35:27.966 --> 35:30.668
And she shot one of her captors
in self-defense.

35:30.735 --> 35:33.036
- Any reports
of shots being fired?

35:33.104 --> 35:34.037
- Nope.

35:34.105 --> 35:35.038
- What do you think?

35:35.106 --> 35:36.072
- I'm not sure.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.608
But that's what
she believes.

tomorrow morning.

she wants to call.

- Let her.

And see if she can
give you a description

Of these captors.

- Leila really likes you.

38:12.660 --> 38:15.495
And you seem like
a decent guy.

38:15.563 --> 38:17.263
You are a decent guy, right?

38:17.331 --> 38:20.300
- Uh, I--I like to think so.

38:20.367 --> 38:23.336
- Good, well,
make my daughter happy,

38:23.404 --> 38:25.805
Treat her with respect...

38:25.873 --> 38:27.807
And that is all I ask.

38:29.910 --> 38:30.843
Scotch.

38:30.911 --> 38:33.379
Now, that is a serious drink.

38:34.682 --> 38:36.983
Sean...Try this.

38:37.050 --> 38:38.884
Very rare stuff.

38:38.952 --> 38:40.186
Gift from a friend.

38:42.956 --> 38:43.890
- Hmm.

38:43.957 --> 38:44.891
- You ready?

38:44.958 --> 38:45.892
- Yes, I am.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.261
- Welcome to the family.

38:48.328 --> 38:50.396
[glasses clink]
- well...Thanks.

38:59.974 --> 39:01.174
- Hey, miss.

39:01.242 --> 39:04.611
Can I get you
some water or tea?

39:04.679 --> 39:08.281
I might have
some tea back there.

39:08.348 --> 39:09.449
- Just have some water.

39:09.516 --> 39:11.618
Thanks.

39:11.686 --> 39:12.619
- Sure.

39:12.687 --> 39:13.920
I'll just be a minute.

39:25.899 --> 39:28.534
She made the call,
but walker didn't pick up.

39:32.404 --> 39:33.571
But she left a message.

39:40.379 --> 39:41.612
- You're gonna be fine.

39:41.680 --> 39:42.747
- Ugh!

39:42.815 --> 39:45.250
- You'll go on
with your life.

39:45.317 --> 39:47.985
Raise a bunch of babies.
Whatever.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.987
- Well, let's just hope
walker gets the message.

40:23.055 --> 40:25.856
Otherwise, I'm not sure
how we're gonna find him.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.661
- He'll get it.

40:30.729 --> 40:33.497
And when he does,
trust me, he'll come.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.307
[phone number ringing]

40:43.375 --> 40:45.309
Dempsey: I hope you're calling
with good news.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.310
- It worked.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.980
She called sean
and left him a message.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.915
As soon as he gets it,
he'll be on his way.

40:51.983 --> 40:54.785
- When he gets there,
take care of him.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.187
This time for good.

40:57.255 --> 40:58.621
- Yes, sir.
