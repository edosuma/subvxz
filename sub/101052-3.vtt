I'd really like to read
for the Steve role.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.970

-Yes, I-I know that.
-I'm sorry, I-I don't have

00:56.389 --> 00:59.517

for Chesterfield or not?

01:06.399 --> 01:07.817
Yeah.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.110
Can you re-slate?

01:09.194 --> 01:12.363

You know, Jon, he's-he's--

01:43.061 --> 01:44.896
He just doesn't cast me anymore.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.898
Oh, babe, I'm sorry.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.359
Don't be sorry.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.361

-We found Luntz.
-Thank God.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.085
Picked him up at a coffee shop
on Grand Street.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.712
He was a bit out of it,
claimed he was here

22:18.795 --> 22:20.255
at the station all morning
talking with you.

22:20.338 --> 22:21.882
Did he have it, the bag?

22:21.965 --> 22:23.759
Uh, no, sir, we caught
the guy who was holding it,

22:23.842 --> 22:25.635
but he handed it off
to some athletic freak.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.887
We lost him in a foot chase.

22:26.970 --> 22:29.890
Well, let's see what our friend
Harry has to say about that.

22:29.973 --> 22:31.266
Hey!

22:31.349 --> 22:32.726
Hello?!

22:32.809 --> 22:34.394
Settle down, Harry.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.772
Har-- What? Who is Har...?
Who is that?

22:36.855 --> 22:38.398
-S-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-What?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.776
-Settle down, Luntz.
-Who is Luntz?

22:40.859 --> 22:43.236
-Who is that? What is going on?
-Uh,

22:43.320 --> 22:46.114
{\an5}-o-okay, who are you?
-What the hell is wrong
with that mirror?

22:46.198 --> 22:48.158
I don't know who that is! What?!

22:48.241 --> 22:49.659
It's like-- it's not--

22:49.743 --> 22:52.287
-That's not me!
-Okay. Okay, okay!

22:52.370 --> 22:54.289
Okay, c-can we start here?

22:54.372 --> 22:56.416
If you're not Harry
and you're not Luntz,

22:56.500 --> 22:57.501
who are you?

22:58.543 --> 23:02.297
I'm John. I'm John.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.424
And I'm not--
That is not me in the mirror.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.801
That is not me.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.303
But it-it looks--
It's a reflection of...

23:08.386 --> 23:10.722
O-Okay. J-John. John.
John, John.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.556
-Look at me, John. John.
-Yeah.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.309
John, I'm here to help you.
Okay?

23:14.392 --> 23:15.477
John, right before this,

23:15.560 --> 23:17.312
-just before this moment.
-Yes.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.814
-Yeah.
-Where were you? Look at me.

23:18.897 --> 23:21.191
-Okay.
-Where were you?

23:21.274 --> 23:22.692
I-I was jogging downtown.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.278
And I just...
I-I don't know what happened.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.948
I just... I-I ended up here,
and I don't know why

23:28.031 --> 23:30.867
I am chained to this table,
and I don't know what that is.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.828
And I don't know who that is,

23:32.911 --> 23:37.165
but I know that that is not me.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.793
I don't feel good.

23:39.876 --> 23:42.295
I feel really weird.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.339
What is happening?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.258
I...

23:47.259 --> 23:48.885
(exhales)
John, I don't know.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.388
I-I don't know what's happening.

23:51.471 --> 23:54.349
{\an5}-But we're gonna find out,
okay? Together.
-Okay, please.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.351
-Please.
-All right?

23:57.310 --> 23:59.604
(entry bell jingles)

24:01.606 --> 24:03.817
Morena.

24:03.900 --> 24:06.486
Morena, it's me. It's Harry.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.196
Morena.
(exhales)

24:08.280 --> 24:09.906
Morena, i-it's me.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.242
(chuckles):
It's Harry.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.339
That place is a fraud.
He just wants your money.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.925
(siren wailing)

24:42.022 --> 24:44.566
You are not
who you appear to be.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.443
What did you say?

24:50.488 --> 24:54.492
I see a man pretending
to be something he's not.

24:57.871 --> 24:59.414
Do you even know?

24:59.497 --> 25:01.500
Know what?

25:01.583 --> 25:03.877
Do you know...

25:03.960 --> 25:05.921
who you are?

25:06.963 --> 25:08.423
I...

25:08.506 --> 25:10.300
I-I guess I don't.

25:13.511 --> 25:15.055
You want to find out?

25:18.475 --> 25:20.435
Are you a psychic?

25:21.478 --> 25:24.022
I'm Keith.

25:24.105 --> 25:26.274
Harry.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.652
Welcome, Harry.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.412
C-Can you help me?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.581
Oh, I most certainly can.

25:41.665 --> 25:45.585
Do we have, uh,
psychic-client confidentiality?

25:45.669 --> 25:48.755
(laughs)
You ain't my client.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.092
Yet.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.777
Your secrets are safe with me.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.615
I robbed a bank this morning.

26:15.699 --> 26:18.618
Oh, really?

26:18.702 --> 26:21.329
Why?

26:21.413 --> 26:24.499
Uh, to get money.

26:24.582 --> 26:26.501
What do you mean?

26:26.584 --> 26:29.629
I don't know.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.506
(sighs)

26:31.589 --> 26:33.967
Honestly, I...

26:34.050 --> 26:37.887
I-I think my girlfriend
is gonna leave me.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.390
She-she may be cheating on me.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.893
My career is...

26:43.977 --> 26:46.021
Hell, it's a dumpster fire. I...

26:46.104 --> 26:48.690
And I-I can't afford
our apartment.

26:48.773 --> 26:52.360
Did she say she was
gonna leave you over money?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.529
She said it isn't about money.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.698
But you robbed a bank.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.700
(scoffs)

26:58.783 --> 27:00.660
(plane passing overhead)

27:00.744 --> 27:02.120
It's...

27:15.633 --> 27:17.677
-Are you still with me?
-Uh...

27:17.761 --> 27:19.721
Okay, listen. In my experience,

27:19.804 --> 27:22.390
when people think things
are about money,

27:22.474 --> 27:24.100
they're generally about
something else.

27:24.184 --> 27:28.688
They're usually about
how much empathy you have.

27:28.772 --> 27:31.691
-Are you being generous?
-Look, this...

27:31.775 --> 27:33.109
With your empathy?

27:33.193 --> 27:35.862
Look, this isn't even
the crazy part.

27:36.821 --> 27:38.406
So why won't you look me

27:38.490 --> 27:40.116
-in the eye, then?
-(laughs): No.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.952
No, that is...
that is definitely a bad idea.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.413
See, that's, um...
(clears throat)

27:45.497 --> 27:47.582
That's kind of the problem.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.042
See, when I-I...

27:49.125 --> 27:50.585
Uh...

27:50.668 --> 27:53.588
When I lock eyes with people,

27:53.671 --> 27:56.466
I-I kind of jump
into their body.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.971
Like this.

28:02.055 --> 28:04.099
This-this isn't really me.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.102
Uh...

28:07.185 --> 28:09.229
So who is it, then?

28:09.312 --> 28:11.106
-(door opens)
-REECE: And here you go.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.607
Thank you.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.609
I was, uh, also able
to get in touch

28:14.692 --> 28:15.735
with your daughter's school.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.070
We'll have somebody pick her up
for you,

28:17.153 --> 28:18.446
drop her off
at your parents' house.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.740
-Thank God.
<i>-JOHN: A running dude,</i>

28:20.824 --> 28:22.075
I guess? I...

28:22.158 --> 28:23.576
I don't really know him.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.495
Why him?

28:25.578 --> 28:27.455
Uh, I don't know. I...

28:27.539 --> 28:30.458
I needed an escape, but...

28:30.542 --> 28:33.461
Now I kind of like
being this guy now.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.631
So...

28:36.714 --> 28:39.843
when you're him, where is he?

28:41.845 --> 28:45.598
You know, I never really
thought about it.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.726
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.816
...anything at all if I could
just have my body back.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.194
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

28:58.278 --> 29:00.530
(exhales)

29:03.867 --> 29:06.619
Amazing.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.166
John?

29:11.249 --> 29:12.709
Keith.

29:13.751 --> 29:15.295
And you are?

29:15.378 --> 29:17.547
Detective Reece.

29:18.381 --> 29:21.801
Detective Reece.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.053
Corduroy suit is
a very brave choice, Mr. Reece,

29:24.137 --> 29:26.723
but you do make it work.

29:31.728 --> 29:34.814
Where were you
before you popped up here?

29:34.898 --> 29:36.900
Where was I?

29:38.610 --> 29:40.904
Where was I? Where was I?

29:41.905 --> 29:45.074
Is anybody ever really anywhere,

29:45.158 --> 29:46.534
Mr. Reece?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.537
What does that even mean?
This is serious.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.081
-I am trying to track down...
-A bank robber?

29:52.165 --> 29:54.334
Well, he ain't here, honey.
So it looks like

29:54.417 --> 29:57.670
you're gonna have to make a deal
with me.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.923
A deal. Okay. What kind of deal?

30:00.965 --> 30:02.717
(chuckles):
Well,

30:02.800 --> 30:05.261
feels like a reward
is in order, no?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.304
-Does it?
-Mm-hmm.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.140
Hmm. Well, I might be open
to discussing that.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.185
But first, I'm gonna need
to know where you came from.

30:12.268 --> 30:13.728
Oh.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.898
Where have you come from,
Detective?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.233
Huh?

30:18.858 --> 30:22.237
Do we have a problem
dealing with stress?

30:23.112 --> 30:25.865
I have a problem
dealing with assholes.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.909
Now, we don't have to talk.

30:27.992 --> 30:29.911
I can just show you
right to your cell.

30:29.994 --> 30:32.205
Aw.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.749
He's at my shop
on Cherry Street.

30:34.832 --> 30:35.625
REECE:
Cherry Street.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.252
(echoing):
And where on Cherry Street?

30:37.335 --> 30:39.754
Do you have the cross street?

30:39.837 --> 30:42.590
No. No!
(grunts)

30:42.674 --> 30:45.760
No. No! No!

30:45.843 --> 30:47.262
(gasps)
No!

30:47.345 --> 30:48.721
-Keith?
-No.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.931
It's John again.

30:50.014 --> 30:52.809
John. I was just back
in my body,

30:52.892 --> 30:54.727
and he-he was there.
He was there.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.730
-He was with me.
-Where is "there"?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.941
Uh, uh, like a,
like a psychic shop.

31:00.024 --> 31:01.276
You're coming with me.
Let's go.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.652
Where-where are we going?

31:02.735 --> 31:04.737
Cherry Street.
Congratulations, John,

31:04.821 --> 31:06.239
you are now a human GPS.

31:06.322 --> 31:09.158
Where was I?

31:09.242 --> 31:10.827
You're with a cop.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.787
Hot daddy, cute suit.

31:12.870 --> 31:14.289
(quietly):
Okay.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.791
I'm stuck in this body forever.
I just--

31:16.874 --> 31:18.418
I just need to get that money
to Morena.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.795
This'll be fine.

31:20.878 --> 31:24.674
You really did do
all that stuff?

31:26.009 --> 31:29.637
Listen, listen...
I'm a scam artist.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.849
Just like you, but you're worse.
Because at least what I do

31:32.932 --> 31:35.268
-makes people feel better.
-(laughs): Oh, yeah.

31:35.351 --> 31:37.812
What are you laughing at?!

31:37.895 --> 31:38.980
Stop being such a dick, Harry.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.274
Thanks.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.359
You can't just shove a gun
in somebody's face

31:43.443 --> 31:46.279
because you want money.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.948
That's a person.

31:49.032 --> 31:51.951
And now...

31:52.035 --> 31:54.829
everybody that walks by,
you treat like a <i> husk</i>

31:54.912 --> 31:57.290
that you can just slither
in and out of,

31:57.373 --> 32:00.001
like a cheap hotel robe?!

32:00.084 --> 32:02.003
And worst of all,

32:02.086 --> 32:04.964
for all that talk about
your little girlfriend Morena,

32:05.048 --> 32:07.800
you treat her like she's
a problem that needs solving.

32:07.884 --> 32:11.721
-I know what I'm doing.
-Do you? Do you really?

32:11.804 --> 32:13.848
I'm-a need you
to get out of here.

32:13.931 --> 32:15.350
{\an5}-No. Hey...
-I'm-a need you
to get out of here

32:15.433 --> 32:16.851
{\an5}-before you drag my black ass
into this bullshit.
-Can I just stay here?

32:16.934 --> 32:19.854
{\an5}-Can I just stay here
until I figure this out?
-No, I'm-a need you to go!

32:19.937 --> 32:21.022
-You gots to go.
-Where am I gonna go?

32:21.105 --> 32:22.357
-You gots to go.
-They're gonna find me.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.358
-Get your hands off me.
-You know what?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.151
-What happened back there?
-Get the fuck out!

32:29.447 --> 32:31.866
Okay. Oh...

32:31.949 --> 32:34.035
(panting)

32:34.118 --> 32:35.828
(gate slams closed)

32:35.912 --> 32:38.331
Shit, the money!
No... no, Keith!

32:38.414 --> 32:40.833
Keith! (shouts)

32:40.917 --> 32:41.876
Open up.

32:41.959 --> 32:45.046
Please. Keith! Hey!

32:45.129 --> 32:47.215
(grunts)
Open up.

32:47.298 --> 32:49.759
Open up. Keith!

32:55.223 --> 32:56.516
Why don't you tell us
what happened, sir.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.393
Yeah, I, uh,
left my bag in there,

32:58.476 --> 33:00.228
and it has some really
important things in it.

33:00.311 --> 33:03.064
Then you come back
and get it in the morning.

33:03.147 --> 33:07.360
I-I don't even know
if it's even there anymore.

33:07.443 --> 33:10.196
I'm sorry, am I the only one
who-who knows

33:10.279 --> 33:12.865
it's-it's illegal to steal?

33:12.949 --> 33:14.742
You left it there you said.
Not the same as stealing.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.911
Please, it's really important
