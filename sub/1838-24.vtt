11:21.934 --> 11:23.700
WE'RE GONNA BE
DOING OUR PART, TOO,

11:23.700 --> 11:26.100
BECAUSE EDDIE AND I
ARE GONNA PERFORM
A LITTLE MAGIC TRICK,

11:26.100 --> 11:29.867

TO WARM UP THE CROWD
BEFORE STANLEY GOES ON.

11:29.867 --> 11:30.600

12:23.233 --> 12:26.100
A ROMANTIC DINNER
ON THE PIER,

12:26.100 --> 12:30.700
THEN A LITTLE
SLOW DANCIN'
FOR DESSERT.

12:32.700 --> 12:34.000
OK, YA LITTLE NASTY,

12:34.000 --> 12:35.100

12:41.800 --> 12:45.200
AND THERE IS
DEFINITELY NO DESSERT.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.100
THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MUCH OF A DATE.

12:48.100 --> 12:52.133
YOU KNOW, RAE, HIS PLAN
WAS MUCH MORE ROMANTIC.

12:52.133 --> 12:54.900
