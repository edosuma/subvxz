thanks for the rec on
where to get the vest.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.068
Great eye, Sean.
Funny story, actually.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.400
My new best friend Grant,
he said to me:

08:52.699 --> 08:57.159
"Colors don't bite.
They're just colors.”

08:57.454 --> 08:58.819
He's awesome.

08:59.122 --> 09:01.159
He's my best friend,
so you know how that goes.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.823
Sounds like a good guy.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.867
Yeah.
Yeah.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.958
Well, I think we can all agree
this night was a success.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.746
Yeah. I had fun.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.506
Hope to see you guys again soon,

09:11.801 --> 09:14.088
and I'll call you later, Penny.
Okay. Bye.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.879
A kiss on the cheek.
Could have got some tongue, bro.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.891
So, what do you think?

09:22.187 --> 09:25.725
| think knowing Grant
is making us so much cooler.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.311
No, no, no.
What do you think of Sean?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.942
| mean, he's cool too.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.729
Brad, know who would be
great couples friends for us?

09:34.032 --> 09:36.319
Who?
Max and Grant. Der!

09:36.618 --> 09:38.029
Are you in my brain?
| might be.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.116
OM-yes! Dream team, baby. Unh!
Unh!

09:41.414 --> 09:44.657
| mean, I'm in all of your heads
right now, because I'm thinking:

09:44.959 --> 09:49.294
Sean, Penny, Brad, Jane--
Dreamy teamy. Aah!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.002
| don't know.
That's on you, babe,

09:53.301 --> 09:55.167
seriously, because...

09:55.470 --> 09:57.256
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.795
| want to get to the bottom

09:59.099 --> 10:01.181
of why Sean
didn't want to have sex with us.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.059
| mean, was he shy?
Was he playing some games?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.470
What do you think
the deal was with that?

10:06.773 --> 10:09.686
Got off the phone with Grant.
| wanted to go do that thing

10:09.984 --> 10:12.851
where we go to a Gymboree
and we scream, "Aidan?"

10:13.154 --> 10:14.315
"Aidan, where are you, honey?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.730
Aidan, Daddy's getting worried.
Aidan?"

10:17.033 --> 10:18.990
But we can't
because obviously he's too busy

10:19.285 --> 10:20.867
taking Penny to a sample sale.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.869
Hey, man.
Chillax about Grant.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.656
Sometimes a boyfriend
isn't the coolest guy around.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.917
Maybe the coolest guy around
is the guy on the couch.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.998
Guy in the scarf
telling me to chillax?

10:31.297 --> 10:33.709
Come on. It's a way better
catchphrase than para hoy.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.669
Not everybody needs to live
for today,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.209
but everyone needs to chillax.

10:37.512 --> 10:39.048
Okay, you're done.
Hit the showers.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.587
Knock, knock, Dr. Spock.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.801
We were just cruising
the neighb.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.683
Wanted to see
if Grant was around,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.059
maybe wanted to hang out.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.470
Maybe feels like fixing things?
Whatever.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.105
Okay, this is very nice
that you guys like Grant,

10:51.401 --> 10:53.688
but it has got to stop.
It's starting to get cray.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.775
Max, I'm so sorry I'm late.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.734
| was doing a bachelor auction
for Jane

10:59.033 --> 11:00.569
but, special bonus:

11:00.869 --> 11:03.406
Enid will be joining us.
Hi.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.572
She has some great stories.
My husband's dead.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.250
That was her best story.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.707
Sorry, Max, but you said
you wanted us to like him.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.963
Well, we love him.
| mean, he's perfect.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.465
Alex, come on.
Nobody is perfect.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.546
God, you're so lucky, Max.
Yeah.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.757
Don't you think
he's lucky to have me?

11:22.056 --> 11:25.014
| used to think Michael Caine
was perfect until I met Grant.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.972
Okay, stop saying Grant is
perfect! Grant is not perfect.

11:28.271 --> 11:30.182
| will find what is wrong
with him right now.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.098
Whoa! Whoa.
Man, that was weird.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.938
| think we all just need
to sit down and chillax.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.853
Is that an indoor scarf?

11:38.156 --> 11:39.863
Look, did I or did I not call

11:40.158 --> 11:41.819
for an across-the-board
chillaxing?

11:42.118 --> 11:44.280
Yep. He is wearing one.
Yep. Definitely.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.365
And sunglasses.
And the shades.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.828
Oh, no. Jane, you guys
really have to cancel tomorrow?

11:51.127 --> 11:52.709
This sucks.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.870
Sean and I were so excited
to lock in

11:55.173 --> 11:57.710
the whole couples thing--
Unexpected Dave!

11:58.009 --> 11:59.044
Hi.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.880
Jane, I gotta call you back.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.761
So, what are you doing there,
friend?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.047
Well, Al told me
the door was broken,

12:05.350 --> 12:08.012
so I'm just here fixing it.
Had to be shirtless to do that?

12:08.311 --> 12:10.848
Well, I was crouching,
and you know how heat lowers,

12:11.147 --> 12:14.936
and the whole thermal
inversion thing, so voila.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.521
So how was the sample sale?

12:16.819 --> 12:19.311
Did you have a blast with Grant
looking at dumb clothes?

12:19.614 --> 12:21.104
The blastiest time ever.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.570
Grant rented us
Italian scooters. So cool.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.110
Well, I drive a food truck,
which is basically a car

12:27.413 --> 12:30.155
full of ovens, so...
Dave, it's not a contest.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.415
You don't have to compete
with Grant or Sean.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.917
Who's Sean?
The point is, you're our Dave.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.328
Everyone stop saying that!

12:36.631 --> 12:38.872
| almost forgot,
Grant bought our Dave something.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.506
He found this jacket

12:40.802 --> 12:43.260
and he just knew
it would look great on you.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.014
Damn it.
This will look great on me.

12:48.309 --> 12:51.893
| am really loving
this look on you, Sean.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.429
Yeah, well, thanks for buying
all this stuff for me

12:54.732 --> 12:56.143
and dropping it off
at my office,

12:56.442 --> 12:58.433
and strongly suggesting
| wear it today.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.192
Well, you said
you liked it on Brad.

13:00.488 --> 13:04.106
In passing. But I gotta admit,
it feels pretty right.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.652
I'm so bummed that Brad and Jane
aren't gonna get to see

13:07.954 --> 13:09.194
how cool you look.

13:09.497 --> 13:11.613
But today is gonna be fun.
| heard about this show

13:11.916 --> 13:14.328
from Max's boyfriend/my dear
friend Grant.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.288
[GASPS]

13:16.587 --> 13:19.079
They're couples-cheating
with Max and Grant.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.373
Grant's probably explaining
the art to them.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.132
Now we'll never know
what it means.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.590
Yeah, I'm sorry, babe.
| know how you want to be...

13:25.888 --> 13:27.925
couples friends with them.
No. You know what?

13:28.224 --> 13:29.840
Not anymore I don't.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.885
Who cares about being Jane and
Brad's stupid couples friends

13:33.187 --> 13:35.895
if we can be Max and Grant's
stupid couples friends?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.680
I'm getting really confused.

13:37.984 --> 13:39.691
Can't we hang out
just the two of us?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.818
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That makes perfect sense.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.820
We'll be each other's
couples friends.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.981
Sorry.
Damn it.

13:51.914 --> 13:54.030
Well, everyone was right.
Grant's perfect.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.166
| can't find a single thing
wrong with him.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.044
Yay, Grant!
Not "yay, Grant." Disaster.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.376
Why are you obsessed
with finding a flaw in him?

14:01.674 --> 14:04.041
Most people would be psyched
to find the perfect guy.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.176
Who doesn't turn his underwear
inside out,

14:06.471 --> 14:07.711
and go
"Good as new, baby."

14:08.014 --> 14:10.301
In this situation,
is he referring to his underwear

14:10.600 --> 14:11.681
as baby or you as baby?

14:11.976 --> 14:13.558
The underwear.
That's disturbing.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.515
Don't change the subject, okay?
| know what you're doing.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.021
When something is too perfect,
you blow it up.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.728
Do not use your dime-store psy--

14:21.027 --> 14:23.234
That's exactly what I'm doing,
but I have to.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.112
If Grant is perfect, that means
I'm not good enough for him.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.863
Max, don't say that.
It's true.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.866
| know I may be tough
on the outside...

14:30.161 --> 14:32.402
Not really.
but I'm fragile on the inside.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.740
A little on the outside too.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.576
And I have to be brave
for everybody.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.832
You love to play the victim.
The point is...

14:38.127 --> 14:40.539
that once Grant realizes
that he can do better than me,

14:40.838 --> 14:42.749
he's gonna dump me,
so I gotta dump him.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.131
It's called taking
prevemtive measures.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.507
Redemptive measures.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.635
| think I'd know
if I was being redemptive.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.092
We're not in Europe.
Okay, you're acting crazy.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.723
All you guys need is
a little time to reconnect.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.884
We'll stay away
SO you guys can have a nice,

14:56.187 --> 14:57.393
quiet dinner for two.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.055
You know what?
That's a great idea.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.441
A quiet dinner for two is
the perfect place to dump him.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.228
No! For love!
For dumping! Thank you.

than you are tall.

in the next coming weeks.

17:48.276 --> 17:49.516
Bonjour.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.856
How do you know
if you're with the right person?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.485
Max. Stop it.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.271
Sean and I are always saying

17:55.575 --> 17:57.407
we want to try absinthe
and just get crazy.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.036
Another thing that makes us have
everything in common with Grant.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.946
Grant and I have
a lot in common too.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.614
| mean, para hoy,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.123
kind of a mantra we started.

18:06.419 --> 18:09.081
Don't forget
our vest-tie combos, huh?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.121
Which I guess we also share
with Sean now.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.882
The look works.
Was kind of a him-and-me thing.

18:14.176 --> 18:17.089
Sean seems to have
leapfrogged you style-wise.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.549
End of an era, hombre.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.430
There's enough of Grant
to go around.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.966
We could learn a lot from him.
He knows so many facts.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.431
Well, I got a bunch
of facts too, so...

18:25.730 --> 18:27.141
| love learning new facts.
Hit me.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.477
You know what?
Keep your facts. I'll keep mine.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.981
MAX:
Here's a fun fact.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.268
Thinking of moving
out of the country. Where?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.812
Doesn't matter, but it will
sever all my personal--

18:36.115 --> 18:38.698
See, there you go.
Speaking of relationships,

18:38.993 --> 18:40.279
Grant, there is a wedding

18:40.578 --> 18:42.785
that Brad and |
are going to in Kona.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.787
That's Hawaii.

18:45.082 --> 18:49.246
And we would like for you to be
our plus-one. All expenses paid.

18:49.545 --> 18:51.627
Grant. Ding, ding, ding!

18:51.922 --> 18:53.959
Sean and I have a wedding
we want you to go to.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.215
It's in Europe,
so it's like a royal wedding.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.343
All expenses paid,
with a very generous per diem.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.596
Per diem?
We'll name a volcano after you.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.848
Do all those things
with them, Mr. Perfect.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.009
I'm sure you'll have
the free time you need.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.223
| think you and |
should have a chat--

19:08.522 --> 19:11.105
Why don't we just take that?
Yay, Grant.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.357
Isn't it gonna be fun
that we all get to keep

19:13.653 --> 19:15.064
hanging out all the time?

19:15.363 --> 19:16.694
SEAN:
So much fun. I can't wait.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.151
BRAD:
What should I wear?

19:19.450 --> 19:22.738
No, please stop!
| can't do this anymore!

19:23.037 --> 19:25.529
Okay? Look,
| wanted you all to like me

19:25.831 --> 19:27.242
because you always hate
everyone.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.248
That is correct.
With good reason.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.705
But I can't be everything
to everyone,

19:32.004 --> 19:33.961
and now I've got this Sean.
Who is this guy?

19:34.256 --> 19:36.122
He's a pharmacist.
I'm a teacher.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.666
What?
| am exhausted.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.676
| wish I could just chillax
like Dave.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.632
Which reminds me, Dave,

19:42.932 --> 19:45.048
what is it gonna take?
You're impenetrable.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.843
| am what I am.
| just did all of that stuff

19:48.145 --> 19:50.102
because I desperately
wanted to be liked.

19:50.398 --> 19:52.355
Wait a minute.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.516
You're not perfect.

19:54.819 --> 19:57.436
You're needy.
That's what he is.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.900
You're flawed officially.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.440
| am, although celebrating it
seems unnecessary.

20:02.743 --> 20:05.201
Yeah, well, I apologize.
That was very rude.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.237
GRANT: Max, I am
not strong like you are.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.451
| care too much what people
think of me.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.209
You don't care about anything,
and I'm lucky to have you,

20:13.504 --> 20:15.586
but I just can't try to
impress your friends.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.747
You don't have to try
to impress my friends.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.085
You've already won me over.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.467
Who cares
what these idiots think?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.048
Grant, you're right.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.088
It's tough being the cool guy
of the group.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.928
Come on, Dave.
This is Grant's moment.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.013
Hey, Grant.
What am I doing right now?

20:30.312 --> 20:32.553
What do these look like?
Sticks?

20:32.857 --> 20:34.018
If you were to describe these,

20:34.316 --> 20:35.852
what do they look like
as a body part?

20:36.152 --> 20:38.234
Legs.
Yeah!

20:38.529 --> 20:39.860
These are walking too, now.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.943
PENNY:
Aww. So cute.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.737
Penny, I'm so sorry
we couples-cheated on you.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.655
It's just Grant called and--

20:50.958 --> 20:52.619
| would have done
the exact same thing.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.659
Instead of competing,
let's just go back

20:54.962 --> 20:56.452
to us being couples friends.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.121
The original dream team.
Yes!

20:59.175 --> 21:01.166
You know, it's early.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.336
Why don't we go back to my place
for a little ménage a four?

21:04.638 --> 21:06.720
What's that now?
Because of the couples--

21:07.016 --> 21:09.053
Finally!

21:09.351 --> 21:12.434
Breadsticks strike again!
Breadsticks, and...

21:12.730 --> 21:14.141
BOTH: No.
Bye, bye, bye.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.025
BRAD & JANE: Bye, bye, bye.
Impenetrable!

21:21.447 --> 21:24.189
[GRUNTING]

21:24.492 --> 21:26.199
Should I be following you?
No!

21:26.494 --> 21:29.907
Oh, come on. Nobody saw that?
It was awesome.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.822
| am the cool guy.
