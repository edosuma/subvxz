They interrupt my practice
and they ruined my field.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.416
l don't want this thing to go unpunished.
Do you hear me?

13:54.667 --> 13:58.170
-All right, back to practice! Come on !
-Wait, wait, wait! He's encouraging this?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.047
Man, l twisted my ankle!

14:00.131 --> 14:01.924
You got buried in cement.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.760
We've got to put an end to this
before somebody gets hurt.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.430
So if there was a truce
that was reached before,

14:09.224 --> 14:10.516
there's gotta be a way to do it again.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.103
Oh, my God !

14:15.605 --> 14:16.772
ls that the cougar?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.774
No shit. She was there.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.108
(LAUGHlNG)

14:20.527 --> 14:22.402
Ladies, this

14:25.532 --> 14:26.615
is our power.

14:26.991 --> 14:30.661
And under no circumstances
do you give up that power

14:30.745 --> 14:34.122
until we are married
and signed up for half his shit.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.707
(BOTH GASPlNG)

14:39.295 --> 14:43.006
Yeah, that's me. l was so innocent back then.

14:43.758 --> 14:48.095
So, l know this was a long time ago,
but do you know how the war ended?

14:48.888 --> 14:53.475
Of course. lt was ended by me.
Let me show you something.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.777
"V" for virginity.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
SHlLO: Virginity?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.447
For reasons still unknown, during the war,

15:07.532 --> 15:10.826
the lacrosse players found themselves
incredibly sexually frustrated.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
And l found myself in a position
to do something about it.

15:13.705 --> 15:17.332
Only the allure of a virgin
would bring peace to both houses.

15:17.834 --> 15:21.044
Okay, so you slept with the entire
lacrosse team and the war just went away?

15:21.212 --> 15:24.548
Well, l slept with both teams but, yes,
the war went away.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.425
So what does this mean?
We have to find a virgin

15:26.509 --> 15:29.970
-who wants to bang the entire lacrosse team?
-Well, good luck with that.

15:30.054 --> 15:32.514
(LAUGHS) l don't think there's a virgin left
on the entire campus.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.682
Oh, my God ! Wait, l know one.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.392
-Don't even think about it.
-What are you talking about?

15:35.518 --> 15:38.979
-Denise.
-Mmm. That's not who l had in mind.

15:42.275 --> 15:48.071
"And with that, Juan Cala de Mercoles
and Susan held each other tightly

15:48.156 --> 15:51.033
"knowing this could be their last embrace."

15:54.287 --> 15:55.579
(DOOR OPENlNG)

15:57.040 --> 15:58.790
-Alex!
-Sammy.

15:59.208 --> 16:02.377
Dude, so much has happened
since you've been gone.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.171
(SlGHS)

16:04.255 --> 16:06.340
Dude, what happened to you? Look at this.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.716
-Ow! Yeah.
-Oops! Sorry.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.803
A lot, actually, um,
which is what l wanted to talk to you about.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.514
-Okay, sure.
-l have a favor to ask.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.099
Ask away, man !

16:18.770 --> 16:21.813
Okay, l don't know how to ask this,
so l'm just gonna put it out there.

16:21.898 --> 16:22.981
Okay.

16:23.566 --> 16:27.069
l need a virgin who's willing to have sex
with the lacrosse team.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.029
Yup. l'm not a virgin, bro.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.739
-You know that.
-Right.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.283
And you're not exactly who l was thinking of.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.536
l was thinking more along the lines of, um. . .

16:36.746 --> 16:38.372
l don't know. . . Skye.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.833
Oh, you're good, man !

16:41.918 --> 16:44.336
Oh, my God, you're doing this
with the whole straight face.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.921
This face is just like, "Virgin."

16:46.005 --> 16:47.881
No, no, no, Sammy,
listen to me for a second, okay?

16:47.965 --> 16:51.134
(STAMMERS) lf we don't do this,
we're all gonna die.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.887
l know you've only known her for a few days,
you're like that. . .

16:53.971 --> 16:56.765
-And are you wearing boat shoes?
-(LAUGHS) You're making fun of my shoes.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.225
Oh, hey!

16:58.434 --> 17:00.018
-What's so funny?
-Oh, my God, Alex was just

17:00.103 --> 17:02.854
making a hilarious joke about you.
You tell her.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.190
You know what? Forget it.
Forget l asked anything.

17:05.274 --> 17:08.318
Mmm-mmm, you have to tell her.
lt is hilarious.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.820
Oh ! Please tell me!

17:11.197 --> 17:12.280
Okay.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.118
So, the football team

17:16.619 --> 17:18.870
is in a war with the lacrosse team.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.498
You know, a very destructive,
horrible, horrible war.

17:21.624 --> 17:24.918
Oh ! l heard about that. That's really tragic.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.254
Yeah, and don't ask me why,

17:27.338 --> 17:30.966
but they need a virgin
to bring peace to the campus.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.676
(SAMMY LAUGHS)

17:33.302 --> 17:35.721
-l'm a virgin.
-l thought you might be.

17:35.805 --> 17:36.888
(SlGHS)

17:36.973 --> 17:38.765
SKYE: Two warring houses.

17:39.308 --> 17:42.602
Two lovers forced to sacrifice their love
for the greater good.

17:42.854 --> 17:46.565
-Hmm.
-Just like Juan Cala de Mercoles and Susan.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.152
-l'll do it.
-Great.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.154
Wait, wait. What?

17:52.697 --> 17:54.781
-Okay.
-Don't you see, sweetie?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.117
This is all meant to be.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.620
All love ends tragically,
just like Juan and Susan.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.333
-This is real?
-Yeah.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.462
Are you serious?

18:09.505 --> 18:12.048
Susan would never bang
the entire lacrosse team.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.009
She would for Juan.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.178
(CRYlNG) Do you even know Susan?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.054
l don't know why,
but this is the only way, Sammy.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.015
l know why. lt's destiny.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.267
There's gotta be another virgin on campus.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.603
-Think about what you just said.
-SAMMY: Oh, God !

18:25.229 --> 18:28.523

No, l won't think about anything !
