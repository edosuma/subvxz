00:07.823 --> 00:09.891
I am Austimus!

00:09.892 --> 00:12.412
I am Dezimus!

00:12.626 --> 00:14.663
And I...

00:14.664 --> 00:17.642
Am putting these away-imus.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.433
Before they break-imus,
because...

00:19.434 --> 00:23.115
Trust me, you
cannot afford-imus.

00:23.116 --> 00:26.708
Wow! You speak really
good Gladiator.

00:26.709 --> 00:30.817
Guess who got a job at the
Mall customer service.

00:30.818 --> 00:32.847
Congrats. What do
you have to do?

00:32.848 --> 00:37.514
I have to take calls from angry customers
complaining about bad service.

00:37.515 --> 00:39.588
Mall customer service.

00:39.589 --> 00:43.972
Oh, I'm sorry that salespeople
always keep you waiting.

00:43.973 --> 00:46.117
Please hold.

00:46.118 --> 00:48.863
Who do they call when they
want to complain about you?

00:48.864 --> 00:52.734
Me. That's the
beauty of this job.

00:52.735 --> 00:56.057
- How's the new song coming?
- It still needs a lot of work.

00:56.058 --> 00:58.165
- We don't have a second verse...
- Great, because I just booked Austin

00:58.166 --> 00:59.984
on "The Wanda Watson
Show" this week.

00:59.985 --> 01:03.233
- That's awesome, Trish!
- "Wanda Watson's" my favorite talk show.

01:03.234 --> 01:07.021
Last week she and Tom Hanks made
gift bags out of old socks.

01:07.022 --> 01:08.882
Ewe!

01:10.519 --> 01:13.921
Hey, Trish, jerk alert. Your
ex-boyfriend just walked in.

01:13.922 --> 01:16.331
Hey, guys. Hey, Trish.

01:16.332 --> 01:19.894
Trent, for the last time, I'm tired
of listening to your apologies.

01:19.895 --> 01:24.935
Well, then you don't have to listen.
Just read.

01:26.203 --> 01:28.363
"I'm"...

01:28.771 --> 01:30.991
"Sorry"...

01:31.674 --> 01:33.608
"That"... Okay, this
is gonna take forever.

01:33.609 --> 01:36.200
Okay, wait, please.
Just read it.

01:36.201 --> 01:39.149
"I pretended to be your boyfriend
just to become Austin's backup

01:39.150 --> 01:42.395
dancer and that I had another
girlfriend the entire time and"...

01:42.396 --> 01:45.186
This is ridiculous.

01:45.187 --> 01:47.822
And why should Trish accept
your T-shirt apology?

01:47.823 --> 01:53.595
Sure, it's clever and adorable
and sweet and kind of romantic.

01:53.596 --> 01:56.236
- Ally.
- Yeah.

01:57.449 --> 02:01.165
Look, okay, the
point is I'm sorry.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.304
So what do you say?

02:03.305 --> 02:07.609
Will you wear this
"apology accepted" hoodie?

02:07.610 --> 02:10.496
Does that answer your question?

02:10.497 --> 02:16.027
Trent, get your T-shirts and
your hoodie and get outta here.

02:16.028 --> 02:20.888
Yeah, get your T-shirts
and get out of here.

<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:33.524 --> 02:36.658
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:36.659 --> 02:38.190
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:38.191 --> 02:39.809
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:39.810 --> 02:42.854
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:42.855 --> 02:45.913
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:45.914 --> 02:47.527
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:47.528 --> 02:49.850
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:49.851 --> 02:53.988
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

02:53.989 --> 02:57.024
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

02:57.025 --> 03:00.094
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:00.095 --> 03:03.417
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:03.418 --> 03:06.067
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:06.068 --> 03:09.445
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:09.446 --> 03:12.563
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:12.564 --> 03:16.884
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:22.559 --> 03:27.187
<i>Whatever it is I've got it.
Don't know what to call it.</i>

03:27.188 --> 03:30.658
<i>There's no way to hide it.
Yeah, I've got it too.</i>

03:30.659 --> 03:34.846
<i>Whatever it is I've got it.
Don't know what to call it.</i>

03:34.847 --> 03:38.369
<i>There's no way around it.
Yeah, I've got it too.</i>

03:38.370 --> 03:42.030
<i>Whoa! Yeah, I've got it too.</i>

03:42.198 --> 03:45.918
<i>Whoa! Girl you've got it too.</i>

03:46.121 --> 03:49.781
<i>Whoa! Yeah, I've got it too.</i>

03:49.988 --> 03:53.708
<i>Whoa! Girl you've got it too.</i>

03:53.785 --> 03:55.705
<i>Whoa!</i>

04:00.954 --> 04:03.512
Man, another great song, Ally.

04:03.513 --> 04:06.008
You're the best
songwriter in the biz.

04:06.009 --> 04:09.667
I wouldn't say I'm the
best, but you can.

04:09.668 --> 04:12.603
I'll say it. That song is great.

04:12.604 --> 04:14.438
Trent, how long have you
been standing there?

04:14.439 --> 04:17.885
Long enough to know that
that is a great song.

04:17.886 --> 04:20.096
Look, I know there are no
shortcuts to making it.

04:20.098 --> 04:24.868
So I was hoping Ally would write me a
song to make me an overnight sensation.

04:24.869 --> 04:27.372
Why would I help you? You
hurt my best friend.

04:27.373 --> 04:29.953
Yeah, buh-bye.

04:30.893 --> 04:33.150
I said I was sorry.

04:33.151 --> 04:36.969
Don't you believe
in second chances?

04:36.970 --> 04:38.769
Of course I do.

04:38.770 --> 04:40.568
Well, I don't.

04:40.569 --> 04:43.449
So again, buh-bye.

04:44.244 --> 04:48.108
Austin, I gave you a second chance
when you kind of stole my song.

04:48.109 --> 04:49.896
Austin stole your song?

04:49.897 --> 04:53.252
She said "kind of".
It was an accident.

04:53.253 --> 04:57.577
And I'm glad I forgave you because
look how awesome it turned out.

04:57.578 --> 05:02.252
It turned out awesome
because I'm awesome-us.

05:02.253 --> 05:05.253
But he's jerk-imus.

05:05.866 --> 05:08.745
I believe everyone's born
with a seed of goodness,

05:08.746 --> 05:11.436
and if you water it with
kindness and trust,

05:11.437 --> 05:14.248
it will blossom into
something beautiful.

05:14.249 --> 05:18.086
Huh. I never thought
of it like that.

05:18.087 --> 05:20.075
You guys are really inspiring.

05:20.076 --> 05:23.045
In fact, I don't even need
your help anymore, Ally.

05:23.046 --> 05:26.364
A song just came to me. Thanks.

05:26.365 --> 05:28.400
See what just happened there?

05:28.401 --> 05:33.021
Austin, I think we made
a difference today.

05:40.371 --> 05:42.128
- Hey, Trish, what are...
- Excuse me.

05:42.129 --> 05:45.180
Mall customer service,
what's your complaint?

05:45.181 --> 05:47.026
Uh-huh.

05:47.027 --> 05:48.378
Uh-huh.

05:48.379 --> 05:54.279
Well, I can assure you, Trish from
the nail salon was fired last week.

05:55.069 --> 05:58.555
So, Trish, as you know,
since Austin became famous,

05:58.556 --> 06:01.258
he and I have been working on
his line of celebrity products.

06:01.259 --> 06:03.871
Austin cell phone case.

06:03.872 --> 06:06.919
Austin disposable wipes.

06:06.920 --> 06:08.298
Austin toothbrush.

06:08.299 --> 06:11.239
Electric and manual.

06:11.469 --> 06:14.437
But we're still trying to perfect
Austin's signature fragrance.

06:14.438 --> 06:16.849
We call this one "manly".

06:16.850 --> 06:18.710
Hmm.

06:18.810 --> 06:22.379
Oh! It smells like nacho
cheese and dirty socks.

06:22.380 --> 06:26.150
Exactly! The two most manly
smells we could think of.

06:26.151 --> 06:28.865
Ewe. What else you got?

06:28.866 --> 06:32.056
Check out this sweet puppy.

06:32.057 --> 06:35.492
Ewe! It smells like
honey and wet dog.

06:35.493 --> 06:40.353
Exactly, that's why we
call it "sweet puppy".

06:40.428 --> 06:42.648
What up?!

06:43.067 --> 06:46.619
Come on, Austin. We have some
important business to take care of.

06:46.620 --> 06:49.306
Let me guess. You want me to
sing to the girl at Zinga Juice,

06:49.307 --> 06:50.801
so you can get a free smoothie.

06:50.802 --> 06:53.837
No, I want you to sing to the
girl at the movie theater,

06:53.838 --> 06:55.326
so I can get some free tickets.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.607
Let's go.

07:01.185 --> 07:03.586
- Hello, Dez.
- Ooh. Uh...

07:03.587 --> 07:05.895
I don't think I'm supposed
to be talking to you.

07:05.896 --> 07:08.895
I just want to say, after
Austin, Ally, and Trish,

07:08.896 --> 07:12.434
you are the most important
person on team Austin.

07:12.435 --> 07:14.098
Why, thank you.

07:14.099 --> 07:17.101
You're welcome, and I think
you're an amazing director.

07:17.102 --> 07:19.136
I love what you did
in this video.

07:19.137 --> 07:23.073
<i>They wanna know-know-know
your name-name-name.</i>

07:23.074 --> 07:26.854
<i>They want the girl-girl-girl...</i>

07:27.112 --> 07:29.146
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

07:29.147 --> 07:31.550
There weren't really
five austins.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.351
No.

07:33.512 --> 07:35.780
So how'd you get the effect?

07:35.781 --> 07:39.612
I'm not just gonna tell
you my secret technique.

07:39.613 --> 07:41.657
You never know who
might be listening.

07:41.658 --> 07:44.958
I'll whisper it to you.

07:49.956 --> 07:52.352
Hey, Dez, here's those
sweaty gym socks you wanted.

07:52.353 --> 07:54.153
Ah.

07:54.157 --> 07:56.124
You making more
cologne for Austin?

07:56.125 --> 07:58.348
Nope, gift bags.

07:58.349 --> 08:00.393
<i>Whatever it is, I got it.</i>

08:00.394 --> 08:02.245
<i>Don't know what to call it.</i>

08:02.246 --> 08:04.539
<i>Ain't no way to hide it, girl...</i>

08:04.540 --> 08:07.170
Mr. Conley, where did
you hear that song?

08:07.171 --> 08:09.814
- Oh, it's all over the Internet.
- The Internet?

08:09.815 --> 08:11.848
You know, that place where
people go on their computers

08:11.849 --> 08:14.436
- to look up stuff and shop and...
- I know what the Internet is!

08:14.437 --> 08:17.822
- How did our song get online?
- It hasn't even been released yet.

08:17.823 --> 08:21.417
It's not Austin's song. It's
by this new artist T-Fame.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.928
I'm thinking about doing a cover
of it for my reggae band.

08:23.929 --> 08:25.404
You're in a reggae band?

08:25.405 --> 08:28.432
There's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

08:28.433 --> 08:30.635
<i>Whatever it is, I got it.</i>

08:30.636 --> 08:34.356
<i>Don't know what to call it...</i>

08:34.438 --> 08:37.359
Who's T-Fame and how'd
he get our song?!

08:37.360 --> 08:39.943
<i>Whatever it is, I got it.</i>

08:39.945 --> 08:42.780
<i>Don't know what to call it...</i>

08:42.782 --> 08:45.684
Excuse me. Can I borrow
that for a second?

08:45.685 --> 08:47.652
<i>Yeah, I got it, too.</i>

08:47.653 --> 08:50.934
<i>Whatever it is, I got it.</i>

08:50.935 --> 08:53.668
<i>Don't know what to call it.</i>

08:53.669 --> 08:58.470
<i>There's no way to hide
it yeah, I got it, too.</i>

08:58.471 --> 09:01.800
<i>Whatever it is, I got it.</i>

09:01.801 --> 09:04.186
<i>Don't know what to call it...</i>

09:04.187 --> 09:05.804
T-Fame is Trent.

09:05.805 --> 09:07.409
He stole our song.

09:07.410 --> 09:09.741
And he totally copied the
"Double Take" video.

09:09.742 --> 09:15.502
You know, I'm starting to think
we can't trust that guy.

09:20.189 --> 09:23.157
I can't believe that jerk
Trent stole my song.

09:23.158 --> 09:25.578
I'm never gonna
trust anyone again.

09:25.579 --> 09:27.333
You can always trust me.

09:27.334 --> 09:30.454
Can I, Austin? Can I?

09:31.692 --> 09:35.867
And how did he pull off the video? It's
exactly the same as "double take".

09:35.868 --> 09:38.172
Somebody must have told
him the secret technique.

09:38.173 --> 09:40.108
We'll probably never
know who it was.

09:40.109 --> 09:45.089
Okay, I did it! You broke me.
I'm so ashamed.

09:45.783 --> 09:48.694
I was gonna sing that song
on "The Wanda Watson Show".

09:48.695 --> 09:49.872
I hate that guy.

09:49.873 --> 09:53.825
Forget about Trent, or "T-lame,"
or whatever he's calling himself.

09:53.826 --> 09:58.385
He can't write his own songs, and
he's not as talented as Austin.

09:58.386 --> 10:01.061
Trust me. He's a
flash in the pan.

10:01.062 --> 10:04.378
T-Fame is no flash in the pan.

10:04.379 --> 10:09.530
His meteoric rise resembles that of another
overnight sensation... Austin Moon.

10:09.531 --> 10:14.702
I sat down with T-Fame to ask him, "is
there a new pop star rivalry brewing?"

10:14.703 --> 10:18.339
Is there a new pop
star rivalry brewing?

10:18.340 --> 10:20.307
Uh, well...

10:20.308 --> 10:26.208
T-Fame doesn't really like to start
any rumors, but yeah, it's on.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.287
Stay smooth.

10:31.353 --> 10:33.788
Whoa! Did you guys
hear the rumor?

10:33.789 --> 10:36.423
Austin and T-Fame
have a rivalry.

10:36.424 --> 10:39.660
There is no rivalry.
He just made it up.

10:39.661 --> 10:42.529
This is crazy. It's like
he's copying my whole life.

10:42.530 --> 10:44.698
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

10:44.699 --> 10:45.800
'Sup, losers?

10:45.801 --> 10:49.470
Meet T-Fame's new best bud Dex.

10:49.471 --> 10:52.506
- What up?!
- Two fingers.

10:52.507 --> 10:55.792
He's totally copying my life!

10:55.793 --> 10:57.966
You didn't even do the
"what up" right, Trent.

10:57.967 --> 11:00.847
Hey, it's T-Fame.

11:01.268 --> 11:03.968
No, it's Trent.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.354
Hey, chill, man.

11:07.355 --> 11:09.755
Stay smooth.

11:17.489 --> 11:19.366
There's two of him?

11:19.367 --> 11:22.303
This is my worst nightmare.

11:22.304 --> 11:25.728
You're not gonna get
away with this, Trent.

11:25.729 --> 11:27.308
I already did.

11:27.309 --> 11:29.103
And it's T-Fame now, okay?

11:29.104 --> 11:32.404
Capital "T", capital "F".

11:32.547 --> 11:35.094
It should be capital
"T" for thief.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.228
- You stole my song.
- Hey, Austin stole your song, too.

11:38.229 --> 11:40.941
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

11:40.942 --> 11:43.557
Okay, well, then mine
was an accident, too.

11:43.558 --> 11:45.101
I accidentally stole the CD.

11:45.102 --> 11:49.563
I accidentally shot a music
video, and I accidentally... Ooh!

11:49.564 --> 11:51.764
Made it a big hit.

11:51.765 --> 11:53.567
My bad.

11:53.568 --> 11:55.736
I knew you couldn't be trusted.

11:55.737 --> 11:58.336
I'm not a pushover like...

11:58.337 --> 12:00.090
Some people.

12:00.091 --> 12:02.643
Or a sucker like...

12:02.644 --> 12:04.545
Other people.

12:04.546 --> 12:06.976
Or a dimwit like...

12:06.977 --> 12:08.837
Dez.

12:10.203 --> 12:13.803
Ha! She called you a sucker.

12:15.457 --> 12:17.391
This ends now, Trent.

12:17.392 --> 12:20.092
I'm gonna go online and tell all
my fans what a fake you are.

12:20.093 --> 12:22.514
This feud is officially over.

12:22.515 --> 12:25.363
This feud is officially on.

12:25.364 --> 12:28.569
Austin Moon has accused
T-Fame of musical thievery.

12:28.570 --> 12:30.356
Sounds like someone is jealous.

12:30.357 --> 12:32.990
And by someone, I
mean Austin Moon.

12:32.991 --> 12:37.191
We have a new "crybaby
of the week".

12:39.966 --> 12:42.906
I'm not a crybaby.

12:43.203 --> 12:46.320
I can't believe the post
to your fans backfired.

12:46.321 --> 12:48.955
You can clear things up when you
go on "The Wanda Watson Show".

12:48.956 --> 12:51.485
It'll just be you and her.

12:51.486 --> 12:55.981
Austin, I can't wait to go on
"The Wanda Watson Show" with you.

12:55.982 --> 12:57.498
What are you talking about?

12:57.499 --> 13:00.301
You didn't know? He didn't know.

13:00.302 --> 13:03.771
I told Wanda we'd go on her show
and end our long-standing feud.

13:03.772 --> 13:07.043
Long-standing? You didn't
even exist two days ago.

13:07.044 --> 13:12.755
Yeah, you guys are going on between Kristen
Stewart, and... Don't freak out...

13:12.756 --> 13:15.160
The Bee Whisperer!

13:15.161 --> 13:17.618
- Who would freak out about...
- The Bee Whisperer?!

13:17.619 --> 13:19.586
I love The Bee Whisperer!

13:19.587 --> 13:21.705
Did you see the episode
where he got a thousand

13:21.706 --> 13:23.846
bees to rescue that
kitten trapped in a well?

13:23.847 --> 13:28.467
Yes! He can train the
bees to do anything.

13:28.645 --> 13:30.345
I can't believe this.

13:30.346 --> 13:32.917
First you steal my
song, then my video,

13:32.918 --> 13:34.979
and now you're stealing
my TV appearances?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.371
Aw, don't get upset, crybaby.

13:37.372 --> 13:39.573
Yeah, stay smooth.

13:39.574 --> 13:42.694
Dex, that's my thing.

13:42.730 --> 13:45.130
Stay smooth.

13:46.681 --> 13:52.038
I am not a big fan of T-Fame, but I
gotta say, I really like that Dex guy.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.939
There's just
something about him.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.794
I hereby call this team
Austin meeting to order.

14:05.795 --> 14:08.690
First up... Getting
back at t-fake.

14:08.691 --> 14:13.702
- Dez isn't here yet.
- Revenge waits for no one.

14:13.703 --> 14:15.624
I want Trent to pay
for what he did.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.610
We gotta come up with
something really good.

14:17.611 --> 14:19.775
Austin, we shouldn't
rush into anything.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.330
I know, Ally.

14:21.331 --> 14:24.546
You're gonna say we should sit
down and reason with him.

14:24.547 --> 14:27.138
Water the plant, people,
and goodness will grow.

14:27.139 --> 14:28.883
Blah, blah, blah.

14:28.884 --> 14:32.235
No, I was gonna say we
shouldn't rush our revenge.

14:32.236 --> 14:34.297
I wanna get this guy.

14:34.298 --> 14:37.152
We need to be ruthless,
plan every detail,

14:37.153 --> 14:42.313
make no mistakes. I don't
wanna go back to jail!

14:43.666 --> 14:46.717
I saw that in a movie once.

14:46.718 --> 14:48.752
I like this new Ally.

14:48.753 --> 14:52.566
We're gonna have a lot of fun together.
So what you got?

14:52.567 --> 14:56.727
This might be going too far, but
before Trent goes on "Wanda Watson"...

14:56.728 --> 15:00.988
We put a "kick me"
sign on his back.

15:03.348 --> 15:06.408
And old Ally's back.

15:06.438 --> 15:11.418
Hey, guys, check out my
super cool Austin suit.

15:12.322 --> 15:15.713
Dez, we don't have time for new
Austin Moon merchandise right now.

15:15.714 --> 15:18.516
No, this is how we'll
get revenge on Trent.

15:18.517 --> 15:21.351
We know he steals
everything from Austin.

15:21.352 --> 15:23.500
We'll leave this suit out
before "The Wanda Watson Show",

15:23.501 --> 15:26.010
and he won't be able
to resist taking it.

15:26.011 --> 15:30.916
And then we stick the "kick
me" sign on the back.

15:30.917 --> 15:34.697
Sweetie, the adults are talking.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.097
So where does the
revenge come in?

15:39.098 --> 15:44.808
This is a sticky suit. When
he stands up, this'll happen.

15:44.809 --> 15:48.207
- Awesome!
- What a great idea.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.077
Of course, he'll be even
more embarrassed because he

15:50.078 --> 15:55.298
won't be wearing extra pants
underneath like I am.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.655
Dez, you're not
wearing extra pants.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.261
What?

15:59.262 --> 16:01.062
Ah!

16:07.666 --> 16:10.501
The hilarious Kristen Stewart.

16:10.502 --> 16:15.662
We'll be right back with
Austin Moon and T-Fame.

16:20.783 --> 16:23.913
The trap's been set. Trent was
totally checking out my suit.

16:23.914 --> 16:25.997
We left it hanging up
in the dressing room.

16:25.998 --> 16:28.653
Now we just gotta sit back and
wait for him to steal it.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.657
Trent's gonna be so embarrassed when
his pants fall off on national TV.

16:32.658 --> 16:38.118
I almost feel bad that I'm
gonna enjoy this so much.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.383
I'm gonna go look out for Trent.

16:41.384 --> 16:46.419
It's The Bee Whisperer. I'm
gonna go get his autograph.

16:46.420 --> 16:48.572
- Hey, bee whisperer.
- Shh!

16:48.573 --> 16:51.886
Whisper. There are bees present.

16:51.887 --> 16:55.739
Now listen up, bees. When you
go out onstage remember...

16:55.740 --> 16:58.140
No stinging.

17:00.752 --> 17:02.930
This is so cool.

17:02.931 --> 17:05.810
This is so stupid.

17:06.564 --> 17:10.728
Here he comes, but he's
not wearing the suit.

17:10.729 --> 17:12.596
See you out there, Austin.

17:12.597 --> 17:16.733
I can't wait to promote
my new product line.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.682
- That's Austin's cologne.
- Oh.

17:19.683 --> 17:21.384
Not anymore.

17:21.385 --> 17:24.025
It's mine now.

17:24.075 --> 17:25.992
Later, losers.

17:25.992 --> 17:28.213
Bye, Dez.

17:28.877 --> 17:30.392
What up?!

17:30.393 --> 17:35.419
Your "what up's" getting worse.
It's not that hard.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.199
Great, now our plan
isn't working.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.063
I can't believe Trent's
gonna win again.

17:39.064 --> 17:41.797
Guys, don't give up yet.

17:41.798 --> 17:44.738
We still have this.

17:45.931 --> 17:48.931
Can we give up now?

17:50.198 --> 17:54.472
And we're back with
Austin Moon and T-Fame.

17:54.473 --> 17:57.375
So, guys, Let's keep this real.

17:57.376 --> 18:00.511
Tell me all about your rivalry.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.993
We don't have a rivalry.

18:02.994 --> 18:07.551
In fact, I'd like to hear
about T-Fame's next song.

18:07.552 --> 18:10.320
Since he writes his own songs.

18:10.321 --> 18:12.966
Whatcha working on, T?

18:12.967 --> 18:15.546
Uh, you know, lots of stuff.

18:15.547 --> 18:18.885
But right now I am really
pumped about my new cologne.

18:18.886 --> 18:21.826
It's called "stay smooth".

18:21.827 --> 18:23.687
Ooh.

18:25.168 --> 18:28.611
Oh! Smells like honey and...

18:28.612 --> 18:30.574
Wet dog.

18:30.575 --> 18:34.115
That's probably what it is.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.481
- 18,782.
- No.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.785
- 18,783.
- No.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.754
- 18,784.
- For the last time,

18:43.755 --> 18:46.252
I don't know how many
bees I have here!

18:46.253 --> 18:48.893
Leave me alone!

18:49.394 --> 18:50.661
What are you doing?

18:50.662 --> 18:53.628
I'm trying to count the bees.

18:53.629 --> 18:56.801
You're letting them out.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.522
Uh, now don't freak out, T-Fame.

18:59.523 --> 19:03.843
Uh, but a bee has
just landed on you.

19:03.865 --> 19:07.434
Oh, it's just one little bee.
No biggie.

19:07.435 --> 19:09.613
And there's another bee.

19:09.614 --> 19:12.785
And another one and another.

19:12.786 --> 19:15.081
A few bees have
never bothered...

19:15.082 --> 19:17.182
T-Fame.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.360
How about 5,000 bees?

19:21.392 --> 19:23.192
Ah!

19:24.563 --> 19:26.564
No... Get off...

19:26.565 --> 19:28.927
The bees are totally
going after Trent.

19:28.928 --> 19:31.389
Calm down. My bees don't sting.

19:31.390 --> 19:34.129
Nobody panic. Nobody panic.

19:34.130 --> 19:35.381
What did he just say?

19:35.382 --> 19:37.407
It was "something panic,
something panic".

19:37.408 --> 19:39.208
Ah!

19:40.269 --> 19:42.069
Ah!

19:42.437 --> 19:45.977
Aw! Please, get 'em off me!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.163
Oh!

19:49.164 --> 19:50.864
No, please! Help!

19:50.865 --> 19:52.785
Help!

19:52.835 --> 19:56.195
Please, it's tickling me.

19:56.415 --> 19:58.221
Get 'em off, please.

19:58.222 --> 20:01.462
Hey, Trent, stay smooth.

20:03.668 --> 20:07.547
Everyone's still buzzing about T-Fame
and Austin Moon's appearance on...

20:07.548 --> 20:09.473
"The Wanda Watson Show".

20:09.474 --> 20:12.676
T-Fame is now accusing Austin of...
Get this...

20:12.677 --> 20:16.680
Causing the bee attack.
T-Fame or t-blame?

20:16.681 --> 20:21.721
Looks like we have a new
"crybaby of the week".

20:25.355 --> 20:28.331
I can't believe Trent
didn't get stung once.

20:28.332 --> 20:30.832
Stupid bee whisperer.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.564
It's gonna take him a long
time to live this down.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.978
I know. When I destroyed
the "Helen" set,

20:35.979 --> 20:38.736
it took people a year to
stop talking about me.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.805
According to viewers,
T-Fame has the second most

20:41.806 --> 20:44.708
embarrassing TV disaster ever.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.158
Still at number one...

20:46.159 --> 20:49.999
Ally Dawson on "The Helen Show".

20:52.884 --> 20:54.684
Ow!

21:06.731 --> 21:09.220
- Classic.
- Never gets old.

21:09.221 --> 21:11.798
She had a drum on her head.

21:11.799 --> 21:15.026
Oh, laugh all you want,
someday I'll get my revenge.

21:15.027 --> 21:17.607
Sure you will.

21:22.784 --> 21:26.267
- Oh! Hey!
- Ow! Why did you kick me?

21:26.268 --> 21:28.428
Told ya.
