02:10.666 --> 02:11.541
Please, Mummy.

02:13.583 --> 02:17.083
I don't care, Mummy! Finding Puleng alive
is the only thing that matters.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.625
They're useless. I can find her.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.416
I can't just sit around
and do nothing, Mummy.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.875
Puleng needs me. I need to go.

02:32.750 --> 02:33.791
We can't.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.250
We don't know who, though.

02:43.333 --> 02:46.375
Fiks and I are working together
by ourselves to try and find Puleng.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.458
They don't know anything.
We can't trust them, Mummy.

02:49.541 --> 02:51.375
Please, Mummy. I need to go.

02:53.041 --> 02:53.875
Mummy, please.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.583
She's ruining everything.
What's she doing?

04:36.916 --> 04:39.416
Uh-uh.
What are you talking about?

05:00.791 --> 05:02.166
You need to believe me.

07:35.875 --> 07:37.500
Hey you, look at me!

07:39.000 --> 07:40.250
This child…

07:47.000 --> 07:49.750
Puleng. Puleng, I'm begging you.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.041
I need you to cooperate for now.

08:31.541 --> 08:33.708
Puleng, let's go to the bathroom, sisi.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.458
Don't stand there like a fucking dick.

08:41.541 --> 08:43.208
Follow these fucking people.

09:06.208 --> 09:09.500
Look, I know I am asking for a lot, okay?

09:18.041 --> 09:20.875
…what makes you think
he's even still alive? Huh?

09:35.958 --> 09:37.666
What did Reinhard say?

09:39.125 --> 09:40.833
You know I can't answer that.

10:00.666 --> 10:01.750
She must get out!

11:18.208 --> 11:19.291
What side are you on?

11:21.125 --> 11:22.083
Pick a side.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.458
And you?

12:09.875 --> 12:11.125
Look into the camera.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.125
You fucking cunt.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.291
Give it to Mommy.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.083
Give it to Mommy.

28:02.166 --> 28:04.875
Give it to Mommy.

28:04.958 --> 28:05.916
Thank you.

30:07.916 --> 30:10.541
Sir, could you please help me
with a situation here?

30:10.625 --> 30:12.916
My child's toy is under the bed, and…

30:13.583 --> 30:15.708
It's quite far and I can't reach it.

31:31.375 --> 31:32.375
Follow me.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.583
Please forgive me for leaving.

32:34.041 --> 32:37.041
Your computer is gone.
The police did a nonsense search

32:37.125 --> 32:39.375
like they were searching up their asses.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.125
What did you want us to do?

32:53.916 --> 32:55.833
You see, I told you.

32:55.916 --> 32:57.041
He's just like you.

37:07.458 --> 37:08.875
Give me my phone, Karabo!

40:12.958 --> 40:14.500
I'll smack you, Chuck Norris.

40:17.708 --> 40:18.750
Look, look, look!

40:22.458 --> 40:23.833
We're getting inside.

41:02.666 --> 41:04.000
We don't have a choice.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.500
It's true, isn't it?
