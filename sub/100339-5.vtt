'Almighty God, we give thanks
for all you have provided us.

00:04.090 --> 00:06.330
'For strengthening us
for your purpose.'

00:06.369 --> 00:08.609
Receive the body of Christ
given to thee.

00:08.650 --> 00:10.969
Preserve thy body and soul
unto everlasting life.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.929
'For bringing hope
in the darkest of hours.'

00:15.970 --> 00:17.689
HE PANTS

00:17.729 --> 00:18.889
'For guiding us.'

00:18.929 --> 00:20.729
'Receive the blood of Christ
shed for thee'.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.249
Preserve thy body and soul
unto everlasting life.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.610
Take it. Take it.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.609
'And above all,
we give thanks to you'

00:33.649 --> 00:36.810
for bringing us together
here in your presence,

00:36.850 --> 00:40.690
no longer strangers
but part of your family.

00:40.730 --> 00:43.929
And through that family,
may we find peace.

00:44.929 --> 00:47.090
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

00:49.929 --> 00:52.090
I've never seen them sit so still.

00:52.130 --> 00:53.770
I think I bored them
into submission.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.090
Whatever it takes.

00:55.130 --> 00:56.209
HUBBUB

00:56.249 --> 00:59.770
Oi. You lot, pack it in.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.649
Well, it was nice while it lasted.

01:02.690 --> 01:06.089
Got any more of that wine, Vicar?
Heathens. The lot of ya.

01:07.569 --> 01:08.809
Mrs Butler.

01:08.850 --> 01:11.690
How are you, June?
You coming to the fight?

01:11.729 --> 01:14.130
Oh, I don't think my nerves
could take it.

01:14.169 --> 01:16.449
Oh, I've been wanting to say, erm,

01:16.490 --> 01:19.250
Matthew isn't the easiest of boys...
Mum.

01:19.289 --> 01:21.490
In truth, he's a little bugger.
Mum!

01:21.530 --> 01:24.050
But spending time with you,

01:24.089 --> 01:25.610
it's changed him.

01:25.649 --> 01:27.009
It really has.

01:27.050 --> 01:29.809
Well, he's a wonderful boy.
You can be very proud of him.

01:34.330 --> 01:36.729
Right.
Time to bang a few heads together.

01:38.890 --> 01:43.369
At the risk of sounding patronising,
I'm proud of you too.

01:43.410 --> 01:45.369
Vic'd be lost without you.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.490
GEORDIE: So this happened last night
at about...?

01:50.530 --> 01:52.050
He's not entirely sure.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.809
How much did they take?
He's not entirely sure.

01:58.009 --> 01:59.970
What did these gentlemen look like?

02:00.009 --> 02:01.649
To be perfectly honest,

02:01.690 --> 02:04.410
I'm not entirely...
Not entirely sure.

02:06.130 --> 02:11.250
So, to clarify, at an unspecified
time on an unspecified street,

02:11.289 --> 02:14.289
some unspecified men robbed you.
That's about the size of it.

02:14.329 --> 02:15.449
Yes.

02:18.449 --> 02:20.210
Knock yourself out, Larry.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.410
Right.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.009
Just what I need, this.

02:29.049 --> 02:32.049
A night of masculine pursuits.
Steady on, Geordie.

02:32.090 --> 02:35.130
Two men, beer, no talk of women.

02:35.169 --> 02:37.650
How is the mother-in-law?
Still driving you round the bend?

02:37.690 --> 02:41.049
Ah. Only talking about manly things,
like boxing and...  Beer?

02:41.090 --> 02:42.530
Beer. Exactly.

02:42.569 --> 02:46.210
Beer, boxing, and...
Bakewell tart, anyone?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.489
Leonard asked if he could join us.
I can see that.

02:48.530 --> 02:51.009
Purely form a charitable aspect,
you understand.

02:51.049 --> 02:52.609
I'm a pacifist.

02:52.650 --> 02:53.769
Never (!)

02:53.810 --> 02:57.729
I'm not quite sure I'll have
the constitution for the violence.

02:57.769 --> 02:59.769
Or the blood, when it comes to that.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.210
Mm. Are you sure I can't tempt you?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.810
I'm fine, thanks.
How's the mother-in-law?

03:06.810 --> 03:08.690
Have your tickets ready,
please, gents.

03:08.729 --> 03:10.410
Programmes tuppence a go.

03:11.970 --> 03:13.049
Here he is.

03:13.090 --> 03:14.729
Good man.
Yeah, it's busy.

03:14.769 --> 03:17.489
Good turnout.
Some might say a resounding success.

03:17.530 --> 03:20.009
Night is yet young.
Half a crown.

03:20.049 --> 03:22.889
That's very generous of you.
Thanks, Keatsy.

03:26.530 --> 03:28.410
No-one ever got poor by giving.

03:28.449 --> 03:31.169
No-one ever got pleasantly drunk,
either. Pint?  Nah.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.370
Leonard?
Ooh... lemonade.

03:34.650 --> 03:35.930
Hey! Ellie!

03:37.489 --> 03:39.810
No. Geordie, no.
What?

03:39.850 --> 03:41.970
The romance has faded, has it?

03:42.009 --> 03:43.530
Ah, no talk of romance.

03:43.569 --> 03:46.850
Jack, will you tell them, the boxing
ring is no place to talk of romance.

03:46.889 --> 03:50.569
You've met my wife, Geordie.
It's precisely the place.

03:50.609 --> 03:53.130
Jack's having trouble with Mrs C.
Yeah, course he is.

03:53.169 --> 03:55.289
She's moved into the spare room.

03:55.329 --> 03:58.090
Oh, dear.
She'll hardly talk to me.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.970
When she does, she has
such a look of disappointment.

04:01.970 --> 04:03.370
Be back in a sec.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.930
KNOCKS

04:09.970 --> 04:11.090
How are we doing?

04:12.210 --> 04:15.210
A little nervous, I'm afraid.
Ah, what's to be nervous about?

04:15.250 --> 04:18.450
You try.
I can't seem to get through to them.

04:18.488 --> 04:19.728
Good luck, boys.

04:21.570 --> 04:25.369
Come on, there's a whole crowd
out there waiting to cheer you on.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.330
That didn't help, did it?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.890
Not really.

04:29.929 --> 04:32.970
Think I'm gonna be sick.
That's the spirit.

04:33.010 --> 04:36.650
Ladies and gentlemen,
honoured guests...

04:36.689 --> 04:39.729
Oh, and Inspector Keating.
LAUGHTER

04:41.770 --> 04:43.570
I wanted to start off
with a boxing joke,

04:43.609 --> 04:46.410
but, er, I can't remember
the punch line, so...

04:46.450 --> 04:47.850
GROANING

04:47.890 --> 04:49.410
That's the last one, I promise.

04:51.570 --> 04:52.929
This place...

04:54.650 --> 04:56.210
I love this place.

04:56.249 --> 04:58.770
I just wanted to prove that...

04:58.809 --> 05:01.369
that everyone deserves a chance
to learn a skill.

05:02.369 --> 05:05.850
To help these boys understand
who they are,

05:05.890 --> 05:07.169
what they stand for.

05:08.770 --> 05:10.330
I couldn't have done any of that...

05:11.450 --> 05:13.289
..without my lovely wife Marie.

05:13.330 --> 05:15.450

05:24.850 --> 05:28.210
Ladies and gentlemen,
this man has been a literal Godsend.

05:28.249 --> 05:29.369
No, it's all you, Vic.

05:29.410 --> 05:32.410
Don't let it go to your head,
but you're an inspiration.

05:32.450 --> 05:34.010
Thank you, son.

Doesn't say much for your sermons.

Is that a tear in your eye?
Oh, shut up.

06:50.249 --> 06:52.010
Is he ignoring me?
Ah!

06:52.049 --> 06:55.850
What?
I am not here to talk about romance.

06:55.890 --> 06:57.570
He's such a child.

06:57.609 --> 06:58.890
Just cos I said no.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.450
Said no to what?

07:02.489 --> 07:04.289
I thought he'd tell you?

07:04.330 --> 07:05.489
Tell me what?

keep moving.

You know what it looked like to me?

08:44.529 --> 08:46.450
No, but I suspect
you're gonna tell us anyway.

08:46.489 --> 08:48.889
It looked like he threw the fight.
Probably put a bet on.

08:48.930 --> 08:51.810
Let it all out, Geordie.
"Oh, he's a bad kid, I told you so."

08:51.850 --> 08:53.690
All right! Tetchy.

08:55.210 --> 08:57.210
Now, then. Ellie.

08:57.249 --> 08:59.570
You really know how
to cheer a fella up, don't ya?

08:59.609 --> 09:01.769
What did she say no to?

09:03.930 --> 09:05.690
He proposed.

09:05.729 --> 09:08.090
You proposed to Ellie?
All right, all right.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.690
Wasn't my finest hour.

09:09.729 --> 09:11.889
Why?
I don't know, I just...

09:11.930 --> 09:15.170
I was speaking to Vic about marriage
and... He asked for my advice.

09:15.210 --> 09:17.369
And that was your advice, was it?
Marry her?

09:17.409 --> 09:19.170
No, no. Not exactly.

09:20.290 --> 09:22.769
Sex is sex, Will.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.649
Most of the time
it's not even that good.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.009
You've made it very clear
you don't understand, Geordie.

09:27.050 --> 09:29.210
So, please can we stop
talking about it?

09:31.690 --> 09:33.649
Right, where the hell are the boys?

09:33.690 --> 09:35.090
I promised them a shandy.

09:37.609 --> 09:40.649
You're not losing hope, are you?
I don't know.

09:40.690 --> 09:42.009
Maybe.

09:42.050 --> 09:43.889
It happens sometimes.

09:43.930 --> 09:46.649
Get in a ring, all that pressure.

09:46.690 --> 09:49.930
It's up and down with these kids,
and today was a down day.

09:49.970 --> 09:52.930
Do you think I expect too much?
I think you expect miracles.

09:52.970 --> 09:54.889
Ah, what's wrong with that?
Nothing.

09:54.930 --> 09:56.609
I wouldn't have you any other way.

Matt?

Luke?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.489
Luke!
Matt!

10:24.529 --> 10:25.769
Luke?

10:27.249 --> 10:28.810
Luke!

10:28.850 --> 10:30.129
Call an ambulance.

10:33.810 --> 10:35.129
Excuse me. Through here.

Benzedrine.

10:55.249 --> 10:57.369
They've had the lot.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.290
Vic.
I didn't do enough for them.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.690
You saved them, Vic.
No.

11:05.729 --> 11:07.489
It wasn't enough.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.375
Good morning.

11:30.414 --> 11:31.694
If you say so.

11:31.735 --> 11:34.574
Full of sunshine
and flowers again, Mrs C.

11:34.615 --> 11:37.735
You're a veritable
cornucopia of joy.

11:37.775 --> 11:39.495
Where's my Brasso?

11:41.454 --> 11:44.414
Who's been cooking in my kitchen?!

11:44.454 --> 11:47.814
That would be your devoted husband.

11:47.855 --> 11:50.135
Dusting's done, vacuuming...

11:50.174 --> 11:51.255
Quiche.

11:52.414 --> 11:55.215
I have made a... quiche.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.015
A quiche?

11:58.054 --> 12:00.615
What unholy nonsense is this?

12:00.654 --> 12:02.574
Your duties for the day are done,

12:02.615 --> 12:04.735
so there's no excuse not to sit down

12:04.775 --> 12:06.975
and resolve
whatever may be troubling you.

12:07.015 --> 12:09.414
Leonard has offered to mediate.

12:09.454 --> 12:10.534
Leonard?

12:17.934 --> 12:20.135
These were locked?
Yeah.

12:21.495 --> 12:22.495
Larry.

12:22.534 --> 12:23.735
Found a key yet?

12:23.775 --> 12:26.735
Swept the whole place.
No key inside. Sorry, boss.

12:27.775 --> 12:30.414
That suggests there was
a third party involved, doesn't it?

12:30.454 --> 12:33.375
If they were locked from the
outside, then someone else was here.

12:37.135 --> 12:39.015
Maybe it was just hi-jinx.

12:39.054 --> 12:41.654
You know, a few...
few uppers, few whiskies.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.015
Come on, Will.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.735
There'd be a note
if it was intentional.

12:45.775 --> 12:46.775
Not always.

12:47.895 --> 12:50.095
But both of them,
I mean, two desperate people

12:50.135 --> 12:52.375
looking for a way out. No.

12:52.414 --> 12:54.895
No, they had this place,
they had a family.

12:56.334 --> 12:57.334
What is it?

13:03.135 --> 13:05.814
A Mr Lucas Rawlings
took out a personal advertisement

13:05.855 --> 13:07.775
once a week for the last two months.

13:07.814 --> 13:10.334
"Young male companion
looking for friendly gent

13:10.375 --> 13:11.934
"for meeting of like-minds."

13:11.975 --> 13:15.054
'Companion' spelt wrong.
'Gent' spelt wrong.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.215
No grammar to speak of.
Meeting of like minds, my arse.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.534
Luke's been importuning.

13:19.574 --> 13:21.735
Any responses?
Just one asking to meet.

13:24.654 --> 13:26.414
Still giving me the cold shoulder?

13:26.454 --> 13:28.054
Jesus would be proud.

13:28.095 --> 13:30.054
I'm standing here thinking.

13:30.095 --> 13:31.414
Such a child.

13:31.454 --> 13:34.054
Can you two cut to the part
where you kiss and make up?

13:34.095 --> 13:36.775
Oh, no kissing
unless we get married, apparently.

13:36.814 --> 13:38.334
Who's being a child now?

13:38.375 --> 13:40.215
Frank mark.

13:40.255 --> 13:42.975
We find out where
the franking machine's registered,

13:43.015 --> 13:45.735
we are one step closer
to finding our "friendly gent".

13:47.015 --> 13:48.454
William Davenport.

13:50.294 --> 13:52.454
Will you marry me?

13:53.454 --> 13:56.414
No.
See? Now we're even.

14:02.895 --> 14:05.255
I understand you're very upset

14:05.294 --> 14:07.615
about decisions I've made
in the past.

14:07.654 --> 14:10.215
But I feel it's unfair of you

14:10.255 --> 14:13.334
to judge me for something
I can no longer change.

14:14.414 --> 14:16.574
Very good, very succinct.

14:17.694 --> 14:19.855
Mrs C.
Mistakes, Jack.

14:19.895 --> 14:21.174
Not decisions.

14:21.215 --> 14:23.334
You've made horrible mistakes.

14:23.375 --> 14:25.375
Non-judgemental, Mrs C.

14:25.414 --> 14:28.975
And you've never made a mistake,
have you, Sylvia?

14:29.015 --> 14:30.215
Non-accusatory, Jack.

14:30.255 --> 14:32.414
Not one that ruined people's lives.

14:32.454 --> 14:35.015
Let's try and bring it back
to the here and now.

14:35.054 --> 14:38.615
I helped desperate families
cross a border.

14:38.654 --> 14:41.615
For monetary gain.
And then you lied about it.

14:41.654 --> 14:44.015
I didn't bloody lie!
Yes, you bloody did!

14:44.054 --> 14:46.975
Listen without fear or favour.

14:47.015 --> 14:49.975
You never asked about it.
Be honest, Sylvia.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.135
Yes. Let us do try and be honest.

14:52.174 --> 14:53.694
You didn't care
where my money was from

14:53.735 --> 14:56.414
when you were going through it
like water.

14:56.454 --> 14:58.694
Perhaps a little too honest there,
Jack.

14:58.735 --> 15:01.015
Sit down, Sylvia.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.654
Sit down.

15:09.615 --> 15:11.174
I'm not a saint.

15:11.215 --> 15:13.174
Never claimed to be.

15:13.215 --> 15:17.654
I made my fortune
through good means and bad.

15:17.694 --> 15:19.814
I've made my peace with that

15:19.855 --> 15:21.615
But if you can't...

15:22.615 --> 15:24.215
..then I'll go.

15:26.735 --> 15:28.414
Was that succinct enough for you?

15:37.215 --> 15:40.574
Franking machine's
only accessible to bank staff.

15:43.654 --> 15:46.934
According to Luke's police report,
he'd never importuned before.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.574
Hadn't so much as touched
a fella's knee.

15:51.814 --> 15:54.054
Do you think
I pushed the boys too hard?

15:54.095 --> 15:56.855
Do not be thinking that, Will.
I won't have it.

15:59.294 --> 16:02.135
Well, what do you know.
That's our fella.

16:02.174 --> 16:04.375
Him? Really?
Trust me.

16:06.534 --> 16:08.454
Mr Burrows.

16:08.495 --> 16:09.615
We meet again.

16:10.975 --> 16:12.775
It's franked in your offices.

16:14.495 --> 16:18.095
There are 30 men in my employ,
anyone could've written it.

16:18.135 --> 16:19.334
Ah.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.215
How many of them
have been loitering in dark alleys?

16:22.255 --> 16:24.095
Are you married, Mr Burrows?

16:24.135 --> 16:26.255
Course he is.

16:26.294 --> 16:28.255
Do you like the company of men?

16:28.294 --> 16:30.814
I'm not sure I like
what you're insinuating.

16:30.855 --> 16:33.375
Did you meet Lucas Rawlings?
I don't know any Lucas...

16:33.414 --> 16:35.135
Yes or no?

16:35.174 --> 16:38.975
If you lie to me, you're perverting
the course of justice.

16:39.015 --> 16:40.015
I...

16:41.054 --> 16:43.294
..replied to his advertisement...

16:44.414 --> 16:46.735
..asking for a...

16:46.775 --> 16:49.215
Meeting of minds?

16:49.255 --> 16:52.495
There was a tussle.
Men, you said.

16:53.694 --> 16:57.054
Two men robbed you.
His friend followed us.

16:57.095 --> 16:59.215
Dark-skinned chap.

16:59.255 --> 17:00.454
He beat me.

17:00.495 --> 17:04.775
And whilst I was on the ground,
he robbed me.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.294
GASPS

17:51.334 --> 17:52.775
Hey, it's all right.

17:52.814 --> 17:54.015
Nurse!

17:54.054 --> 17:55.574
Nurse.
Don't worry.

17:55.614 --> 17:57.134
I'm here.

18:04.094 --> 18:06.574
Did you intend to die, Matthew?

18:09.574 --> 18:10.735
Christ.

18:10.775 --> 18:12.415
And Luke?

18:14.614 --> 18:16.334
Why didn't you come to me?

18:16.374 --> 18:18.655
You know you can come to me.

18:18.695 --> 18:20.814
Would you give us a moment?

18:29.094 --> 18:31.255
Did you notice any tension
between them?

18:31.294 --> 18:33.134
Luke and Matt?
Mm.

18:34.534 --> 18:36.294
Only at the match.

18:36.334 --> 18:38.134
Nothing before that?

18:41.975 --> 18:43.935
Did you know
they were up to no good again?

18:45.655 --> 18:47.294
I suspected.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.894
Luke kept showing up with cash
he couldn't answer for.

18:49.935 --> 18:51.534
And Matt was covering for him.

18:53.294 --> 18:54.455
I told them that was it.

18:54.495 --> 18:56.655
After the match,
they were both out on their ear.

18:56.695 --> 18:58.975
I don't even know if I meant it,
really. I mean...

19:00.175 --> 19:02.015
What were they up to? Robbing?

19:02.054 --> 19:03.054
Hm?

19:04.294 --> 19:05.894
Importuning.

19:07.655 --> 19:09.015
Oh, Christ.

19:11.094 --> 19:12.655
Oh, what a mess.

19:14.374 --> 19:16.255
You know you can tell me anything.

19:17.854 --> 19:19.215
Did you get the note?

19:20.255 --> 19:21.695
You left a note?

19:24.134 --> 19:25.614
What did it say?

19:31.134 --> 19:32.455
Matt.

19:32.495 --> 19:35.534
We know Luke was meeting
with a gentleman.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.735
Was that what was in the note?

19:38.735 --> 19:40.215
Were you involved, too?

19:43.574 --> 19:45.534
Matt, what was in the note?
Don't touch me.

19:45.574 --> 19:46.894
Matt.
Get off me.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.574
Get off me!
Hey, Matty. Come on.

19:49.614 --> 19:53.094
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

19:59.255 --> 20:01.374
You know the law's changed.

20:01.415 --> 20:02.854
What law?

20:02.894 --> 20:05.775
When two people agree to commit
suicide and one survives...

20:06.814 --> 20:08.655
..they only get done
for manslaughter.

20:08.695 --> 20:11.614
Not murder like it used to be.
Which is relevant how?

20:14.374 --> 20:16.134
Front page.

20:19.215 --> 20:20.534
Maybe Matt read this.

20:20.574 --> 20:23.294
Same newspaper Luke's ad was in.

20:23.334 --> 20:25.255
Husband wants wife gone.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.655
50 years of marriage'll
do that to a chap.

20:29.175 --> 20:33.374
He kills her and makes it look like
he wanted to meet his maker as well.

20:35.975 --> 20:38.854
What, so you think Matt staged the
whole thing to look like a suicide?

20:38.894 --> 20:41.655
You think he tried to kill Luke?
I'm just keeping an open mind.

20:41.695 --> 20:43.334
Oh, you made up your mind
a long time ago.

20:43.374 --> 20:45.655
You have given him
chance after chance.

20:45.695 --> 20:47.975
He is a boy, Geordie,
not a master criminal.

20:48.015 --> 20:49.695
A criminal, nonetheless.

20:49.735 --> 20:52.015
Matt said he left a suicide note.

20:52.054 --> 20:54.574
Someone else was there,
someone took it.

20:54.614 --> 20:56.455
Whatever was in that note
was so damning,

20:56.495 --> 20:58.655
this person didn't want
anyone else to read it.

20:58.695 --> 21:01.215
If someone was there, Will,
who was it?

21:11.015 --> 21:12.054
Mr Burrows.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.775
What else happened with those boys?

21:14.814 --> 21:16.814
You promised.
After they beat you.

21:16.854 --> 21:18.614
You promised
this would go no further.

21:18.655 --> 21:19.975
Did you want to pay them back?
No.

21:20.015 --> 21:21.215
Did you find them at the gym?

21:21.255 --> 21:23.455
People will see.
Let them. Let them see.

21:23.495 --> 21:25.415
There was a suicide note.

21:25.455 --> 21:28.935
Did you take it?
I don't know anything about a note.

21:29.935 --> 21:31.255
Can we just...

21:40.054 --> 21:42.735
I was with the boy once,
that's all.

21:44.775 --> 21:47.015
I thought you wanted this.

21:47.054 --> 21:49.015
MATT: Yeah, well,
he doesn't anymore.

21:50.894 --> 21:53.015
I want what I paid for.

21:56.175 --> 21:58.374
What did they say?
I don't know.

21:58.415 --> 22:01.215
They must've said something.
I don't know.  What did they say?

22:02.334 --> 22:05.775
Something about,
"He makes us think this is normal.

22:05.814 --> 22:07.054
"It's not normal."

22:08.094 --> 22:11.374
All I know is the lad was willing
until his friend arrived.

22:11.415 --> 22:12.574
It was consensual.

22:12.614 --> 22:15.574
Luke's barely more than a child.
In your eyes, maybe.

22:30.415 --> 22:34.015
WALTER'S VOICE: "He makes us think
this is normal. It's not normal."

22:47.094 --> 22:49.054
Yeah, you've pulled something.

22:49.094 --> 22:51.054
Hey?
Just relax.

22:52.655 --> 22:54.894
You're doing so well, just relax.

23:07.775 --> 23:09.255
VIC: Just relax.

23:11.814 --> 23:13.614
Relax.

23:13.655 --> 23:16.215
Hey, hey.
Stay away!

23:16.255 --> 23:19.094
Stay away! Stay away from me!

23:19.134 --> 23:22.294
Yeah, a bit of ice on that,
should sort it.

23:24.054 --> 23:28.255
Hey. You don't fancy a pint, do ya?
It's been hell of a day.

23:30.255 --> 23:31.894
It's the boys.

23:33.215 --> 23:34.534
Luke?

23:34.574 --> 23:36.455
What's happening?

23:36.495 --> 23:38.255
Let me see him. I wanna see him!

23:46.415 --> 23:47.614
Jesus.

23:47.655 --> 23:49.094
Oh, my God.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.344
Did he suffer, do you think?

24:09.384 --> 24:10.584
I don't think so.

24:12.904 --> 24:16.065
What was so terrible that you felt
that was your only way out?

24:21.225 --> 24:22.624
Is it Vic?

24:25.344 --> 24:26.745
What did he do to you?

24:33.664 --> 24:37.025
Hang the diplomacy.
It's high time I gave...  Shoes!

24:40.864 --> 24:42.985
I gave you a piece of my mind.

24:43.025 --> 24:46.584
Operation Entente Cordial is FUBAR,
I'm afraid, Leonard.

24:46.624 --> 24:49.025
Hostilities have resumed.

24:49.065 --> 24:51.265
Hostilities never ceased.

24:51.305 --> 24:53.664
Because you're stubborn.
Both of you.

24:53.705 --> 24:55.545
Stubborn... sods.

24:56.545 --> 24:59.745
Have you ever thought,
it's not others who need to change?

24:59.785 --> 25:01.664
We are the ones who must change.

25:01.705 --> 25:04.985
You don't half talk
a lot of rot sometimes.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.864
You're impossible, Mrs C!
You expect too much of people.

25:07.904 --> 25:10.745
I doubt even Jesus would live up
to your standards.  Hear, hear!

25:10.785 --> 25:13.545
You're not going to leave her,
she's not going to leave you.

25:13.584 --> 25:17.265
You are simply going to have to
sit down and find a solution.

25:17.305 --> 25:19.265
You owe that much to each other.

25:21.265 --> 25:23.825
I do not want to see
either of you again

25:23.864 --> 25:26.985
until you can promise
to be pleasant to each other.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.584
Dickens!
DOG BARKS

25:33.944 --> 25:37.745
So, you say Luke took those tablets
of his own accord.

25:38.944 --> 25:42.025
And you had half the amount
that he had in his system.

25:42.065 --> 25:43.584
How'd you count for that?

25:43.624 --> 25:45.144
I can't.

25:45.184 --> 25:47.664
Who put the sign on the door
saying to call the police?

25:47.705 --> 25:48.904
Me.

25:48.944 --> 25:50.745
I didn't want other kids to find us.

25:50.785 --> 25:52.745
And you claim
there was a suicide note?

25:54.785 --> 25:56.265
Yes.
So where is it?

25:58.505 --> 26:01.344
Vic was gonna throw you out
the club for a mistake Luke made.

26:01.384 --> 26:02.624
That must've stung.

26:02.664 --> 26:04.825
No that's not true.
So tell me why, Matthew.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.745
He's exhausted, he's had enough.

26:06.785 --> 26:09.505
Did you kill Luke and set it up
to look like suicide?

26:09.545 --> 26:12.465
If Matt set this up, don't you think
it would've been more obvious?

26:12.505 --> 26:14.745
Did you want him to die, Matt?
It doesn't make any sense.

26:14.785 --> 26:17.065
Did you want him to die?
You can't claim Matt set it up

26:17.104 --> 26:19.065
if the evidence doesn't support it.

26:19.104 --> 26:20.664
Outside.

26:29.305 --> 26:31.545
Bloody hell,
could you undermine me any more?

26:31.584 --> 26:34.545
Matt's not gonna talk. Not with you
shouting your mouth off.

26:34.584 --> 26:36.825
He's not gonna talk with Vic there.

26:36.864 --> 26:38.465
Why not?

26:39.505 --> 26:41.144
Just give me five minutes with him.

26:42.785 --> 26:44.265
You're not gonna tell me, then?

26:44.305 --> 26:47.384
Just make an excuse,
get Vic out of there.

26:48.384 --> 26:49.664
Five minutes, Geordie.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.344
Operation Infant Cordial.

26:56.505 --> 26:58.344
It's like it's all a big joke
to you.

26:58.384 --> 26:59.864
I was desperate.

27:00.904 --> 27:02.785
I love you.

27:02.825 --> 27:05.985
And I don't know how to mend things
between us.

27:13.745 --> 27:15.864
I was married to a bastard once.

27:17.465 --> 27:19.424
I promised myself never again.

27:21.505 --> 27:22.985
And then I met you...

27:24.985 --> 27:27.944
..and I thought,
there's someone decent.

27:27.985 --> 27:29.664
And good.

27:31.825 --> 27:33.944
Someone I can trust.

27:35.025 --> 27:37.545
I'm still all those things.

27:37.584 --> 27:38.944
Are you?

27:41.184 --> 27:43.584
I have a past I'm not proud of.

27:43.624 --> 27:46.424
But then, I met a woman

27:46.465 --> 27:49.864
who made me want to be
so much better.

27:51.465 --> 27:53.225
I've written to Tariq.

27:54.424 --> 27:56.985
Offered him and his family
financial support.

27:57.025 --> 27:58.424
Good.

27:58.465 --> 28:02.184
And as for us,
no more lavish spending,

28:02.225 --> 28:03.664
no more frivolities.

28:06.545 --> 28:08.104
What do you say?

28:10.065 --> 28:12.384
I miss my lovely jewellery.

28:13.424 --> 28:14.985
I knew it.
HE CHUCKLES

28:15.025 --> 28:16.944
I knew it!

28:22.785 --> 28:25.144
I know how impossible
it must seem...

28:26.144 --> 28:27.545
..to say the words.

28:28.864 --> 28:30.584
But now is the time.

28:31.705 --> 28:35.904
Matt, if they charge you with
murder, then your life will be over.

28:35.944 --> 28:38.745
And is your silence really worth
more than your future?

28:41.025 --> 28:43.184
This is not your shame to carry.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.065
He said I was special.

28:58.624 --> 29:00.225
He said I was his favourite.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.384
He, erm...

29:17.465 --> 29:20.225
He takes them in
when no-one else will.

29:20.265 --> 29:22.505
He makes them feel safe.

29:22.545 --> 29:24.505
And then he molests them.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.505
Matt, Luke. All the boys.

29:38.825 --> 29:39.785
Hey.

29:41.384 --> 29:43.104
Just relax.

29:43.144 --> 29:45.265
He'd buy us beers, ciggies...

29:45.305 --> 29:48.745
Dirty magazines.
He'd look at the pictures with us.

29:50.104 --> 29:51.545
Make a laugh of it.

29:54.025 --> 29:55.785
Some nights, I...

29:55.825 --> 29:57.424
didn't say no.

30:01.785 --> 30:03.505
I should've said no, shouldn't I?

30:04.745 --> 30:06.944
Makes a game of it.

30:06.985 --> 30:09.144
Makes them believe
that they want it.

30:10.104 --> 30:12.025
It's what men do, isn't it?

30:13.705 --> 30:15.225
They treat us like dirt.

30:17.144 --> 30:19.065
Might as well
make a bit of money from it.

30:20.065 --> 30:22.225
It's not how it should be.

30:22.265 --> 30:24.025
Yeah, don't let him
make you think that.

30:24.065 --> 30:25.864
Do you believe him?

30:25.904 --> 30:27.825
There's no doubt in my mind.

30:33.705 --> 30:36.825
He'll have to come in
and make a statement.

30:36.864 --> 30:38.624
Matt tried to leave...

30:40.384 --> 30:42.545
..and I sent him back to Vic,
Geordie.

30:44.705 --> 30:46.505
I sent him back.

31:00.225 --> 31:01.705
What's going on?

31:02.825 --> 31:04.584
Search the place.
What's going on?

31:04.624 --> 31:05.864
Vic?

31:08.424 --> 31:11.384
You...
Will!

31:11.424 --> 31:13.104
Get up!

31:16.944 --> 31:18.944
Mr Morgan, I'd like to ask you
a few questions

31:18.985 --> 31:21.144
about the molestation
of Matthew Butler.

31:22.184 --> 31:24.985
What?  I suggest you come with us
voluntarily.

31:25.025 --> 31:26.225
But...

31:27.225 --> 31:29.384
..if you wanna make
things more official...

31:57.985 --> 32:01.184
Did you buy them, Mr Morgan?
Well, it wasn't my missus, was it?

32:02.465 --> 32:04.664
Well, who'd you buy them for?
The boys.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.384
I bought 'em all sorts.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.144
Er... car magazines, comics.

32:09.184 --> 32:10.785
What else did you buy them?

32:12.305 --> 32:14.944
You're gonna try and make
my generosity look sinister,

32:14.985 --> 32:15.985
aren't you?

32:16.025 --> 32:18.505
What did you expect in return?

32:18.545 --> 32:19.545
Nothing.

32:20.864 --> 32:23.025
You don't expect them
to pay you back?

32:23.065 --> 32:24.344
No.

32:24.384 --> 32:26.664
Not with a kiss?

32:29.265 --> 32:31.184
How could you even think that?

32:32.184 --> 32:34.184
Not by climbing into bed with them?

32:34.225 --> 32:35.825
Is that what Matt said?

32:35.864 --> 32:38.065
That is disgusting.

32:38.104 --> 32:40.025
That is disgusting lies.

32:40.065 --> 32:42.745
A boy made that up?
A convicted criminal.

32:42.785 --> 32:44.705
Yeah, I never agreed
with your scheme.

32:44.745 --> 32:47.025
I thought it was
a load of old bollocks.

32:48.424 --> 32:51.025
But I admired you
for standing by those boys.

32:53.745 --> 32:55.985
How quick you are
to throw them to the wolves.

32:56.025 --> 32:59.265
He's trying to ruin my reputation.
Why would he do that?

32:59.305 --> 33:01.424
Well... He was out the gym.

33:01.465 --> 33:03.584
I... I guess this is his revenge.

33:03.624 --> 33:06.144
Trying to kill himself
is his revenge?

33:06.184 --> 33:09.664
I've only done good for these boys!
You know that, Will, you saw it.

33:09.705 --> 33:12.065
And all you've got
is a couple of girly magazines

33:12.104 --> 33:14.104
and the words of a liar.

33:27.584 --> 33:29.184
Where's Matt?

33:29.225 --> 33:31.465
Dunno.
Has he given his statement?

33:31.505 --> 33:32.785
Don't think so.

33:36.545 --> 33:37.944
Matt!

33:37.985 --> 33:41.065
He's said all he's gonna say.
You need to tell Geordie.

33:41.104 --> 33:43.864
He has to stop telling these
vicious lies.  They're not lies.

33:43.904 --> 33:45.705
I know my son.

33:45.745 --> 33:48.745
Rotten through and through
like his father.

33:48.785 --> 33:51.065
Just tell Geordie what you told me.

33:51.104 --> 33:54.864
Don't you dare.  I will do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

33:54.904 --> 33:56.265
What will people think?

33:59.144 --> 34:00.825
Dirty little pervert.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.225
Don't bother coming home.
Mum.

34:04.265 --> 34:05.384
Mum.

34:05.424 --> 34:07.544
DOOR SLAMS

34:14.344 --> 34:15.984
What, you'll keep me safe, will you?

34:17.464 --> 34:19.625
Matt.
How's that worked out so far?

34:19.665 --> 34:21.784
How's that worked out?!

34:21.824 --> 34:23.145
Huh?
That's enough!

34:23.185 --> 34:25.504
No, Geordie. Geordie, leave him!

34:25.543 --> 34:26.745
Geordie!

34:34.424 --> 34:35.705
Get off me!

34:36.984 --> 34:38.264
Get off me.

34:47.665 --> 34:50.424
You know, it's times like this you
find out who your true friends are.

35:13.974 --> 35:15.454
It's from my father.

35:16.454 --> 35:17.894
I wrote to him.

35:17.934 --> 35:19.695
You didn't tell me that.

35:19.735 --> 35:22.494
I don't think
I was really expecting a reply.

35:25.255 --> 35:27.375
You read it, please.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.735
Do you want to know?
Yes. No.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.534
Do I?

35:42.894 --> 35:44.534
He wants to see you too.

35:46.175 --> 35:49.094
He says, er, it's been too long.

35:50.295 --> 35:51.974
He's blaming me.

35:52.014 --> 35:54.534
Leonard. No, he's blaming me
for his failings.

35:54.574 --> 35:55.855
He misses you.

35:55.894 --> 35:57.175
You don't know him.
No.

35:58.494 --> 35:59.894
But I know his son.

36:01.054 --> 36:03.215
And I've seen him grow
from a frightened boy

36:03.255 --> 36:05.414
into the formidable man
standing in front of me.

36:07.614 --> 36:10.695
Am I really formidable?
Terrifying.

36:12.974 --> 36:14.135
Write to him.

36:29.094 --> 36:30.255
Thanks.

36:35.375 --> 36:38.414
What does it say about me
that I liked Vic?

36:38.454 --> 36:40.295
It's what they do, these men.

36:40.335 --> 36:42.255
They pull the wool
over everyone's eyes.

36:42.295 --> 36:44.894
Everyone fell for him, Will.
Not just you.

36:44.934 --> 36:48.094
And they will keep falling for him
if you don't arrest him.

36:48.135 --> 36:49.934
On what evidence?
Matt's word.

36:49.974 --> 36:51.255
It's not enough.

36:51.295 --> 36:54.255
Well, the other boys then.
No-one's talking, Will.

37:00.375 --> 37:03.375
You can go if you like.
I'm not much company.

37:03.414 --> 37:05.574
Oh, I'd rather stay here
than go home.

37:06.655 --> 37:07.775
Mother-in-law?

37:09.614 --> 37:11.775
I had her committed to an asylum.

37:12.775 --> 37:14.934
Please tell me
this isn't one of your awful jokes.

37:14.974 --> 37:16.094
I wish to hell it was.

37:17.655 --> 37:19.215
How's Cathy?

37:19.255 --> 37:20.894
She's quiet. Sad.

37:22.295 --> 37:24.735
She hid it from me.
Not that I blame her.

37:26.054 --> 37:28.414
It's what she grew used to,
I suppose.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.375
Living with something like that.

37:31.934 --> 37:33.894
'Did you tell anyone?'

37:36.735 --> 37:39.094
Who?
It doesn't matter.

37:39.135 --> 37:40.735
They didn't wanna listen.

37:41.775 --> 37:44.735
She grew used to keeping
someone else's secret.

37:51.695 --> 37:52.775
Vic's not here.

37:52.815 --> 37:55.454
Can I come in? It won't take long.

38:02.295 --> 38:04.414
How long have you known?

38:04.454 --> 38:06.775
I don't know
what you're talking about.

38:06.815 --> 38:09.574
You had your suspicions, didn't you?
You must've done.

38:09.614 --> 38:12.054
And then they were confirmed.

38:15.135 --> 38:16.775
How we doing?

38:16.815 --> 38:18.574
A little nervous, I'm afraid.

38:18.614 --> 38:19.974
Good luck, boys.

38:21.135 --> 38:23.974
It was you
Matt and Luke came to, wasn't it?

38:26.054 --> 38:28.855
My husband is a kind man.

38:28.894 --> 38:31.735
You're his smoke screen, Marie.
He loves me.

38:31.775 --> 38:34.414
Did you go back to the gym
to speak to the boys?

38:35.414 --> 38:38.855
I'd like you to leave now.
Was it you who found them?

38:41.934 --> 38:44.494
Was it you
who took the suicide note?

39:02.135 --> 39:04.534
He helps the boys.

39:04.574 --> 39:06.934
He loves them.

39:06.974 --> 39:10.614
If you do nothing,
you're as much to blame as he is.

39:37.255 --> 39:40.175
After this, I have nothing more
to say on the matter.

40:00.735 --> 40:02.735
I want to hear you say it.

40:06.534 --> 40:08.655
I want to hear you say what you did.

40:09.614 --> 40:13.094
Those kids are li...  "He told us
it was because we were special."

40:13.135 --> 40:14.414
I'm not listening to this.

40:14.454 --> 40:17.054
"It was because he loved us,
we'd been chosen."

40:17.094 --> 40:18.534
I don't want to hear it.

40:18.574 --> 40:21.295
"He touches us. He hurts us.

40:21.335 --> 40:24.375
"We just want it to stop."
I swear on my life.

40:27.414 --> 40:28.934
On Marie's life.

40:30.215 --> 40:32.335
That is not me.

40:32.375 --> 40:34.494
I want to hear you say it, Vic.

40:37.855 --> 40:39.974
Well, hit me if you're gonna.

40:40.014 --> 40:42.295
Say you hurt them.

40:42.335 --> 40:44.574
That's what you wanna do, isn't it?

40:44.614 --> 40:46.175
Well, go on.

40:46.215 --> 40:48.614
They were in your care.
Go on, hit me.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.215
And you defiled them.
Hit me!

40:50.255 --> 40:53.534
You drove a boy to kill himself!
Go on, do it!

41:01.414 --> 41:02.974
I'm a good man.

41:04.614 --> 41:06.375
You really believe it, don't you?

41:08.695 --> 41:10.135
If that boy...

41:10.175 --> 41:15.295
wants to stand up in court and say
those vile things about me...

41:16.974 --> 41:18.894
..then that's what
he's gonna have to do.

41:20.295 --> 41:22.135
But it'll be my word against his.

41:23.295 --> 41:24.934
And I don't like his chances.

41:39.335 --> 41:42.094
I want you to read it.
I want you to read what he has done!

41:42.135 --> 41:44.295
Go on.
I already have.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.574
He has to be stopped.

41:49.614 --> 41:52.494
You do it.
You're the only one, Marie.

41:52.534 --> 41:54.215
You are the only one
who can stop this.

41:54.255 --> 41:56.934
We've been married for 19 years.

41:58.295 --> 42:01.534
When you live with someone like him,
they erode you.

42:02.534 --> 42:04.175
You lose all sense of who you are.

42:05.494 --> 42:07.454
And it's only about them.

42:07.494 --> 42:11.695
They make you feel weak and lost.

42:12.894 --> 42:14.175
Marie...

42:14.215 --> 42:16.335
You don't have to feel lost anymore.

42:31.135 --> 42:33.014
Marie would like
to make a statement.

42:58.934 --> 43:00.815
You think we're all naive,
don't you?

43:02.574 --> 43:05.655
You know, Will only fell for it
because he is the best of men.

43:08.054 --> 43:09.295
This has broken him.

43:10.335 --> 43:11.454
Yeah.

43:11.494 --> 43:13.255
Though I doubt you give a shit
about that

43:13.295 --> 43:14.974
any more than you do
about those boys.

43:16.534 --> 43:18.054
That you done, Keatsy?

43:18.094 --> 43:20.255
Only I'd like to get my head down
now.

43:23.534 --> 43:24.534
VIC GRUNTS

43:24.574 --> 43:26.335
COUGHS

43:59.175 --> 44:01.335
GLASS SMASHES,
CLATTERING

44:08.135 --> 44:09.775
God gave us Eden.

44:11.655 --> 44:13.534
He gave us perfection.

44:15.335 --> 44:17.094
And what did we do with it?

44:18.735 --> 44:20.454
We destroyed it.

44:21.775 --> 44:23.135
We sinned.

44:24.454 --> 44:28.934
And we grew prideful
and vengeful and angry.

44:30.295 --> 44:34.494
We surrounded ourselves with snakes
who only want the worst for us.

44:34.534 --> 44:36.175
And who do we blame for that?

44:37.775 --> 44:39.454
We blame God.

44:41.255 --> 44:42.974
How dare we?

44:43.014 --> 44:44.855
It is us.

44:45.894 --> 44:48.014
It is our doing.

44:49.375 --> 44:51.695
And it is all we deserve.

44:51.735 --> 44:56.934
God will always forgive,
he will always offer salvation.

44:56.974 --> 44:59.414
But I don't believe all of us
deserve it.

45:01.735 --> 45:06.014
If we sin, we break God's law.

45:06.054 --> 45:10.815
If you sin,
you do not deserve his love.

45:10.855 --> 45:13.775
You do not deserve his salvation.

45:14.775 --> 45:19.375
You deserve all of the snakes
and the misery and the suffering.

45:19.414 --> 45:21.775
That is all we deserve.

45:30.894 --> 45:32.454
It is all we deserve.

45:33.305 --> 45:39.632
