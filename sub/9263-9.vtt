they're on the team.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.288
(Landry)
You know, you gotta
make a change, my friend.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.665
This is
extremely important.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.959
This isn't just
a first date, this...

10:25.959 --> 10:27.627
This is your‐‐

10:27.627 --> 10:28.962
your pre‐release party.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.923
My what?
We're on the brink here.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.967
I mean, Dillon is
a .500 team right now,

10:33.967 --> 10:35.635
but you beat Gatling
this Friday‐‐

10:35.677 --> 10:36.970
which, good luck
with that, by the way‐‐

10:36.970 --> 10:38.805
and then you're
a winning team again,

10:38.847 --> 10:40.473
which is just
instant rock star status.

10:40.515 --> 10:43.268
All‐‐all these things
are older than we are.

10:43.309 --> 10:43.977
Well, it's called retro,

10:44.018 --> 10:45.812
and the chicks dig it,
trust me.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.313
Oh, I forgot you're such
an expert about that.

10:47.313 --> 10:48.982
Your last girlfriend
was what,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.483
Jenny Emil?

10:50.525 --> 10:51.985
That was like fifth grade
or something?

10:51.985 --> 10:52.986
I mean, that's fine.

10:53.027 --> 10:54.487
If you wanna get personal,

10:54.487 --> 10:55.488
I mean, you know,
that still hurts.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.657
And it was, you know,
it was a bad breakup.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.992
So thank you
for bringing that back up.

10:58.992 --> 10:59.826
I appreciate that.
Sorry.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.827
That's fine, I mean,
I'm just trying

11:00.827 --> 11:01.911
to help you out,
and you wanna get all personal.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.497
All right, well then,
let's get back to helping me out

11:04.539 --> 11:05.707
and stop this
heart‐to‐heart.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.709
No, no, no!
What's wrong with these?

11:07.750 --> 11:09.836
This is something
that Matt Saracen would wear.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.838
Julie Taylor's about to go
on her first date

11:11.838 --> 11:12.839
with a football player.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.007
She doesn't want the man,

11:14.007 --> 11:14.966
she wants the myth.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.843
So you gotta pull out

11:16.843 --> 11:19.345
your big guns here, buddy.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.347
Now tell me,
can you say...

11:21.347 --> 11:24.309
"Members Only"?

11:27.061 --> 11:30.023
Junior Silverio is the key
to the Gatling defense.

11:30.023 --> 11:33.860
We shut him down,
we shut down this team.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.528
Pudnick, get you up here.

11:35.570 --> 11:39.532
[players cheer him on]

11:39.532 --> 11:40.867
This is him right here.

11:40.909 --> 11:42.535
And it would be him too.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.871
If he was bigger, stronger,
and could actually tackle,

11:44.913 --> 11:46.080
it would be him.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.916
Now look,
we're not gonna run

11:47.957 --> 11:48.917
from this guy.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.543
We are gonna go through
this bump.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.670
We're gonna punch a hole

11:52.712 --> 11:53.880
right through the heart

11:53.880 --> 11:55.381
of this Eagles defense,
you understand?

11:55.423 --> 11:56.549
(players)
Yes, sir!

11:56.549 --> 11:58.509
It is going to be a war.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.386
And we're gonna
make a statement

12:00.386 --> 12:02.013
that's gonna lead us
all the way to State!

12:02.055 --> 12:03.348
(players)
Yes, sir!

12:03.389 --> 12:04.891
Bring it in.
Let's go, let's go!

12:04.933 --> 12:08.394
[players shouting]

12:08.436 --> 12:10.563
(Smash)
One, two, three!

12:10.563 --> 12:12.023
(players)
Panthers!

12:12.065 --> 12:14.067
What's up, Street?
What's up, fellas?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.860
Me and the guys
wanted to come by.

12:15.902 --> 12:16.903
How are you, man?
Oh, yeah.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.571
How you doing?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.572
Ain't y'all supposed to be
getting ready

12:19.614 --> 12:20.615
for Gatling this week?
Yeah, man.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.076
Been getting Saracen
killed back there, I hear.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.577
[laughter]

12:24.619 --> 12:25.912
You got my message, man?

12:25.954 --> 12:28.081
Yeah, yeah.
I got your message.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.457
If there's one thing
we don't allow,

12:29.457 --> 12:31.084
it's for somebody
to hit our quarterback.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.752
Riggins didn't hit me.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.045
I hit him.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.089
And I am fine.
So...

12:36.089 --> 12:37.882
Don't make anything of it,
all right?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.593
Where did all the pictures
on the wall go, man?

12:40.635 --> 12:43.388
Just, uh...I been here
for a while, man.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.765
You know, just wanted
to change things up, you know?

12:45.765 --> 12:46.599
The nurse outside
told us

12:46.641 --> 12:48.393
that we're
your first visitors today.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.769
Where's Lyla?

12:49.811 --> 12:51.396
She just not around,
or what?

12:51.437 --> 12:52.397
Busy.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
Yeah?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.779
Riggins and Lyla?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.952
You know me and the guys
always got your back.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.828
We're gonna take care
of this, man.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.295
Look, I'm just asking you

13:15.295 --> 13:16.629
to watch her
for a couple hours, okay?

13:16.671 --> 13:17.755
I'll give you
Julie's number.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.757
It's just...
she doesn't like...

13:19.799 --> 13:22.135
the idea of being alone
at night, so...

13:22.135 --> 13:23.636
You know, I'm‐‐
I'm really thrilled

13:23.636 --> 13:25.138
about the idea
of being left alone

13:25.138 --> 13:26.306
with your grandmother
at night.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.141
You know how I feel
about the whole situation.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.809
Landry, my grandma
is not a witch.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.311
Okay?
She's just not.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.479
Hey, Matt.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.107
Come here.
Hey, Lance, how you doin'?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.442
Uh, it's‐‐it's Landry.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.359
Huh? Yeah.
It's Landry.

13:38.401 --> 13:39.819
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.487
Uh, yeah.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.781
What's‐‐what's up, Coach?

13:43.823 --> 13:45.324
Big date night tonight?

13:45.366 --> 13:47.493
Oh, yeah, but, uh...

13:47.535 --> 13:49.495
I'm gonna have her home early,
right after the movie.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.372
Oh, I know you will.
I know you will.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.373
What's going on
with Riggins?

13:52.415 --> 13:54.542
Uh...what do you mean?

13:54.542 --> 13:56.294
What I mean is,
I have eyes.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.837
I wanna know
what's going on out there.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.840
You‐‐all due respect, sir,
I just don't really feel

14:00.840 --> 14:01.632
it's my place
to say anything,

14:01.674 --> 14:04.677
so I'm gonna‐‐
I'm‐‐I'm not going to.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.679
You know what, I appreciate
your allegiance

14:06.721 --> 14:08.681
to your teammates,
but you're also team captain.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.683
So if there's somethin'
going on out there

14:10.683 --> 14:12.351
that's gonna affect
his game Friday night,

14:12.351 --> 14:13.686
I suggest that you tell me.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.813
Well, it's‐‐
it's just a rumor.

14:15.855 --> 14:16.689
What kind of rumor?

14:16.731 --> 14:18.858
Somethin' about somebody
he hooked up with.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.193
Or‐‐maybe.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.360
Someone he hooked up with.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.196
And I don't even
think it's true,

14:23.237 --> 14:24.530
so that's why
I don't really want‐‐

14:24.572 --> 14:26.365
Who is it?

14:26.365 --> 14:27.450
Spit it out.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.702
Doesn't need to be anything
between us, spit it out.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.537
With Lyla.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.372
Lyla Garrity?

14:33.414 --> 14:35.917
Yeah.

14:35.917 --> 14:38.336
All right.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.837
Can I go now?
Yeah, have a good time
at the movies.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.381
Hey‐‐my daughter and I
talk a lot.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.509
Okay.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.263
Hey, Jordanna called.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.224
They invited us
to a barbeque tomorrow,

14:51.224 --> 14:52.558
when we get to Gatling.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.643
Hold up.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.728
You're gonna put Brian
and Junior in the same room?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.730
Look, they may be enemies
on the field,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.398
but off the field,
the Silverios

14:59.398 --> 15:01.192
are still some
of our best friends.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.693
Huh, well, why'd you
move us away from them?

15:02.735 --> 15:04.737
Because Dillon is safer,
that's why.

15:04.779 --> 15:05.905
Yeah, and whiter, too.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.908
You move us to Dillon to get us
out of the ghetto?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.660
Or to get us
away from Dad?

15:15.456 --> 15:16.958
You don't know
what you're talking about.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.876
No, I really want
to bring it up.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.419
Like, we‐‐we should
talk about this.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.255
You need to shut your mouth.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.756
Mama, I'm serious‐‐

15:23.798 --> 15:24.924
Take your smart mouth
and your plate

15:24.924 --> 15:28.261
and get away
from my table.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.389
You don't talk to me
like that.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.769
[doorbell rings]

15:36.811 --> 15:38.437
Hey.
Evening, Coach.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.438
Wait, wait, wait.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.441
Is that a Members Only jacket?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.277
Uh...yeah, what‐‐
what do you think?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.278
You think it's okay?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.404
Hey, Matt.
How are you?

15:46.445 --> 15:47.446
Come on in.
I'm fine.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.364
How are you doing, ma'am?

15:48.406 --> 15:49.782
(Tami)
Great. You look nice.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.783
(Matt)
Well, thank you.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.785
Um...is‐‐is Julie here?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.453
Is she ready?
Hey, Matt.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.621
Hi‐‐hi.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.664
Uh‐uh.
All right.

15:56.706 --> 15:57.832
Um, you know what?

15:57.874 --> 15:59.000
You look really nice.
Thanks.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.294
(Tami)
Let me just have
a quick word with little Jules.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.254
Why don't y'all go wait
in the living room?

16:03.296 --> 16:04.463
And, um...

16:04.505 --> 16:06.465
We'll just be a‐‐
just a sec, okay?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.633
(Taylor and Matt)
All right.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.302
Just come on,
just for one second.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.804
(Taylor)
Why don't you take
your Members Only jacket off

16:11.846 --> 16:13.806
and hang it on
the coat rack?
Sorry, what?

16:13.848 --> 16:14.974
Hang your jacket up, Matt.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.643
Oh, yeah.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.313
This is not actually what
you're gonna wear on your date.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.314
But this is what
people wear on dates.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.648
Not that other dress.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.775
I know, but baby, this is not
what you wear on dates.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.986
And you can't even walk
in those shoes.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.487
Come on.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.323
I love you.
Come on.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.949
You want a beer?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.492
Uh, no thanks.
I'm driving.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.328
I was joking.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.872
(Julie)
So, um, have you heard

16:37.872 --> 16:39.373
good things
about the movie?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.542
Oh, yeah, one of my people
recommended it, so...

16:41.542 --> 16:43.294
You mean Landry?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.838
Yeah.

16:45.838 --> 16:46.839
Uh, can I get‐‐

16:46.881 --> 16:49.008
Can I just get two
for Eragon, please?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.635
I'm sorry, sir.
Eragon is sold out.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.470
Oh, I'm Matt Saracen.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.974
QB1?

16:57.016 --> 16:58.351
[laugh]

16:58.351 --> 16:59.977
Quarterback?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.520
And...?

17:01.520 --> 17:02.688
And I thought
that you

17:02.688 --> 17:04.315
held tickets
for football players.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.859
Not since Reyes started
a fight in the balcony.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.361
It took
three security guards
[cell phone ringing]

17:08.361 --> 17:10.029
to break that one up.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.864
Yeah, but he's not
on the team anymore, so it's‐‐

17:11.864 --> 17:13.032
it's okay.
Hello?

17:13.032 --> 17:14.700
You can give me
those tickets.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.869
Uh...yeah.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.704
Yeah, yeah, just a second.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.539
Matt, it's, um‐‐

17:20.581 --> 17:22.041
Your people is calling.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.542
Huh?

17:23.542 --> 17:25.878
Hello?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.838
Whoa, I told you,
if anything goes wrong,

17:27.880 --> 17:28.881
just turn on
the Discovery Channel.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.550
She'll be all right.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.009
Okay, okay.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.053
All right, all right.
I'll be right there.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.013
Um, we gotta
go back to my house.

17:37.932 --> 17:40.393
(Matt)
Look, um, I'm really sorry

17:40.393 --> 17:42.520
that we had
to come back here, it's just‐‐

17:42.562 --> 17:44.063
It's only going to take
like a second, so I'll‐‐

17:44.063 --> 17:45.064
Okay, look, look, look,

17:45.106 --> 17:46.732
I‐I swear
I did not touch her.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.859
We were watching TV, and she
just started flipping out.

17:48.901 --> 17:49.902
Where is she?

17:49.944 --> 17:54.073
She's in the clos‐‐she
locked herself in the closet.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.408
What closet?
Right over here.

17:55.449 --> 17:59.745
[Mrs. Saracen crying]

17:59.787 --> 18:01.122
Gr‐‐Grandma?

18:01.122 --> 18:02.915
I'm gonna come in,
okay?

18:02.957 --> 18:04.625
(Mrs. Saracen)
I'm not gonna let him
touch me like that!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.419
I did not touch her‐‐
I know, it's fine.

18:06.460 --> 18:09.755
Um, Grandma, I'm gonna
have to come in there, okay?

18:09.755 --> 18:11.757
I want Joel.
I want Joel.

18:11.757 --> 18:12.758
She's asking for Joel‐‐

18:12.800 --> 18:13.676
Yeah, it's my grandfather.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.428
Your grandpa's been dead
for six years‐‐

18:15.428 --> 18:16.554
I know, I know that.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.930
[sobbing]
Joel...

18:17.972 --> 18:20.057
Oh...
I want Joel...

18:20.099 --> 18:21.934
I want Joel.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.769
[deep voice]
Dar‐‐darling?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.896
Are you‐‐
are you in there, darling?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.940
Joel, is that you?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.401
Oh, it's‐‐it's me.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.902
Hey, sweetheart.
I'm gonna‐‐

18:31.944 --> 18:33.779
I'm gonna need you
to come out of there, okay?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.448
Joel.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.783
Sing to me.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.410
Sing our song.

Oh, that's how we do it.

19:27.041 --> 19:28.000
(Mrs. Saracen)
Oh, Joel.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.835
Oh, that bed looks good.

19:29.877 --> 19:30.836
(Matt)
There you go.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.463
See you in my dreams,
okay?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.674
I love you.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.509
I love you too.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.011
Okay?

19:39.053 --> 19:40.805
Mister Sandman.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.682
You better get sweet dreams,
so he can come.

19:42.682 --> 19:43.683
[giggles]

19:43.724 --> 19:45.142
You get some sleep.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.110
Um...

19:55.695 --> 19:58.030
I'll‐‐I'll just get Landry
to take me home.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.490
Okay.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.885
Ly‐ly?
You in there?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.387
Comin' in, precious.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.638
[door opens]

20:23.556 --> 20:26.559
Honey...

20:26.559 --> 20:28.728
You didn't come down
for breakfast.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.646
You're late for school,
honey.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.568
Carpe diem.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.028
Daddy, I'll be
right down, okay?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.697
Okay.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.660
[door closes]

20:44.702 --> 20:46.579
Seems like
you got home mighty early

20:46.579 --> 20:47.913
from your date last night.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.124
How was the movie?

20:50.124 --> 20:51.125
Was it good or...

20:51.125 --> 20:52.918
You realize
we can't talk about

20:52.918 --> 20:53.753
these kind of things,
right?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.838
Oh, right, sorry.
I lost my head.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.922
I apologize.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.341
We never
went to a movie.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.762
And, no, we weren't
parked somewhere or anything.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.637
Matt just got a call,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.056
and he needed to help out
his grandma.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.516
Sorry about that.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.562
It was...sort of okay.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.606
It was like...
the first time

21:13.606 --> 21:15.816
I actually go to see
the real Matt Saracen.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.445
Hmm.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.905
I totally blew it.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.865
And that stupid jacket
didn't help any.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.409
Well, Matt, there's no reason
to blame the couture.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.911
Just 'cause you couldn't
pull it off.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.497
I end up singing
to my grandma.

21:29.497 --> 21:30.831
Look, all I asked you to do

21:30.831 --> 21:31.999
was watch her
for a couple hours‐‐

21:31.999 --> 21:33.375
Okay, listen, Casanova.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.460
You singing to your grandma

21:34.460 --> 21:36.462
was probably the only thing
that you did right.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.713
Oh, yeah?
Why is that?

21:37.755 --> 21:40.132
Well, I mean,
Julie totally bought it.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.801
She told me so
on the way home.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.968
What'd she say?

21:42.968 --> 21:44.762
Well, she said
that it was sweet.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.722
And vulnerable.

21:46.764 --> 21:47.973
Sweet and vulnerable?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.892
Mm‐hmm.
That's what she said?

21:52.645 --> 21:54.647
Great, sweet and vulnerable

21:54.647 --> 21:56.148
is like a kitten, Landry,
not a boyfriend.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.650
Well, calm down,
I mean, you gotta‐‐

21:57.650 --> 21:59.777
you gotta take what you got
and work with it.

21:59.819 --> 22:02.738
You know, drop the whole
quarterback macho thing.

22:02.780 --> 22:03.864
You clearly can't
pull that one off.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.076
And, you know, you use
the sensitive, artistic thing.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.744
So you think there actually
might still be a chance

22:08.786 --> 22:11.038
that she's kind of maybe
like, a little bit‐‐

22:11.038 --> 22:13.457
Singing to your grandma
may be the one thing

22:13.499 --> 22:14.959
that gets you into
Julie Taylor's funhouse.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.502
What?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.504
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about that.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.798
That's‐‐that‐‐
that's just wrong.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.760
We're just gonna have
to tell those people

22:24.802 --> 22:25.594
that they're gonna
have to provide

22:25.636 --> 22:27.847
first class
accommodations for us,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.015
just like we gave them

22:30.015 --> 22:31.475
when they came here,
and it's as simple as that.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.476
That's what we do.

22:32.518 --> 22:34.854
Well, I think, you know,
it's gonna be important

22:34.854 --> 22:36.814
not to put them
on the defensive.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.691
And I'm not sure that
that's gonna be the best way

22:38.691 --> 22:40.526
for us to get what we want.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.445
Oh, Tammy, you know
how these people are.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.823
Oh.
Well‐‐

22:45.865 --> 22:47.700
They don't‐‐
they don't like us.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.702
But I still think
that we might wanna just

22:49.702 --> 22:51.537
give it a little bit
of a different approach.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.582
Just sort of, you know,
tip it on its head a little bit,

22:54.582 --> 22:55.583
if you know what I mean.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.959
I know.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.128
I know.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.672
I see why my daughter
loves you, though.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.465
She speaks so highly
of you.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.884
Aww...she's a sweet girl.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.718
Yeah.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.721
Have you seen anything
lately with her,

23:08.721 --> 23:09.555
anything different?

23:09.555 --> 23:11.891
She got some big problem
or something?

23:11.891 --> 23:13.851
Well, um...

23:13.893 --> 23:15.561
She's not eating,
and she just seems...

23:15.561 --> 23:16.562
distracted.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.231
You know, I'm thinking
maybe it's just that...

23:19.231 --> 23:20.566
teenage girl thing.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.151
But I‐‐what do I know?

23:22.192 --> 23:23.903
I think, as a parent,
best thing you can do

23:23.903 --> 23:26.196
is, uh...

23:26.238 --> 23:27.740
just don't try to fix it.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.158
Just‐‐just be there
for her.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.744
Just let her know
you love her.

23:31.744 --> 23:33.704
That's good.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.624
You know, you and I
are gonna make a great team.

23:36.624 --> 23:38.959
Because I can tell
you just kill 'em with kindness.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.169
Okay.
And I'll just, uh,

23:40.210 --> 23:41.921
I'll put a little
pressure on 'em,

23:41.921 --> 23:44.256
and see if we can squeeze some
nicer digs out of 'em.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.884
Oh, okay.
All right, then.

23:46.926 --> 23:50.095
You need to get the lead
out of your ass before Friday.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.764
Come on, let's go.
Push!

23:51.764 --> 23:54.934
[grunting]

23:54.934 --> 23:56.602
Don't worry.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.104
I'll be ready for prime time,
just like Dad taught me.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.940
Would you shut up
about Dad

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
and stop bringing him up?

24:02.775 --> 24:04.777
Look, we going
to the city where he died.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.737
And I don't know why we're not
allowed to talk about him.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.780
Don't you think
that's weird?

24:07.780 --> 24:08.781
No.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.950
Mom might hate him,
but that don't mean I do.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.076
Seven.

24:12.117 --> 24:13.953
I remember the guy who taught me
how to throw a spiral.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.163
And took us fishing.
Your point is?

24:16.163 --> 24:17.122
And gave me my nickname

24:17.164 --> 24:19.959
after I crashed my bike
into the water heater.

24:19.959 --> 24:20.709
Well, you know what?

24:20.751 --> 24:22.127
I remember
other things, Brian.

24:22.127 --> 24:25.089
Don't matter, Sheila.
He was our dad.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.592
[grunting]
I don't see what
the big mystery is.

24:28.634 --> 24:29.969
The only mystery is how
you can move your mouth so fast,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.220
but your legs
are moving so slow.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.262
Come on.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.639
[grunting]

24:33.639 --> 24:35.307
Brian, let's go.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.725
[panting]

24:36.767 --> 24:38.769
Oh, my God, Brian!

24:38.811 --> 24:39.937
Breathe, breathe!

24:39.979 --> 24:42.106
[raspy panting]
Breathe.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.819
Yeah, clean
as a whistle.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.778
Yeah, at this point,

24:47.820 --> 24:49.571
I'm thinking
it's just anxiety.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.990
You been under
any stress lately?

24:50.990 --> 24:52.574
Yeah.

24:52.616 --> 24:54.827
We got a big game
coming up on Friday.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.829
Oh, yeah.
Gatling defense.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.039
Yeah.
I'd be stressing too.

24:59.039 --> 25:01.333
Just get some rest, okay,
and you'll be fine.

25:01.375 --> 25:02.793
And take it to 'em, okay?

25:02.835 --> 25:03.836
Yes, sir.
All right.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.254
Thanks.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.673
See? No big deal.
So just chill.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.675
Oh, please don't
tell me to chill.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.802
Since when did you start
having anxiety attacks?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.762
You know I always
get excited before games.

25:14.972 --> 25:17.850
Did your face
always break out too?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.018
Look...

25:19.018 --> 25:20.978
You either tell me
what's going on,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.688
or Mom's gonna find out.

25:22.688 --> 25:24.857
Come on.
[sighs]

25:24.857 --> 25:26.942
Look, it's just some
pick‐me‐ups I've been taking.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.944
I got it from my trainer.
It's all legit.

25:28.986 --> 25:29.987
[whispering]
Pick‐me‐ups?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.864
What, from some
fake bodybuilder

25:31.864 --> 25:32.698
at some stupid gym?

25:32.740 --> 25:33.949
Look, don't check me
on this, all right?

25:33.991 --> 25:35.325
I know what I'm doing.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.869
It's just gonna
give me a little edge.

25:36.869 --> 25:37.870
Boy, since the time
you were nine years old,

25:37.870 --> 25:38.871
it's been all about you.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.081
You never have to do
anything around the house,

25:41.081 --> 25:42.916
Sheila‐‐
just so you can practice.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.376
Somebody's gotta step up
and be the man of the house

25:44.376 --> 25:45.878
now that Dad's not around.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.796
You are gonna
get into trouble.

25:47.838 --> 25:48.881
Do you not
understand this?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.299
Look, Sheila,
let me just‐‐

25:50.340 --> 25:52.301
let me just be clear
with you, all right?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.011
Football is my life.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.889
That's all I got
in this world.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.224
I need your help.

Hi.

Coach.

27:09.128 --> 27:10.420
How you doing?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.464
Good.
Better than you.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.966
You got Gatling this weekend.

[chuckles]

27:15.843 --> 27:17.136
Well, you know what?

27:17.136 --> 27:18.470
We're gonna be patient
with the offense.

27:18.470 --> 27:19.972
We're gonna take what we can,
is what we're gonna do.

27:20.013 --> 27:20.764
I know you're busy,

27:20.806 --> 27:22.766
but I just wanted
to let you know

27:22.808 --> 27:23.934
I played in that scrimmage
the other night.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.979
And, uh...
think I did pretty well.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.146
I heard you did.
I heard you threw the ball well.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.106
And I heard
you gave 'em hell.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.983
And I'm sorry
I couldn't have been there.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.485
Did you, uh...

27:33.527 --> 27:35.487
did you hear anything else?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.948
Yeah.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.075
Yeah, I heard.

27:41.326 --> 27:44.079
Sorry I laid
your fullback out.

27:46.206 --> 27:47.833
You all right?

27:49.167 --> 27:51.503
You know, it's just
you think you...

27:51.503 --> 27:52.796
you think you know someone.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.340
And then you don't.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.466
Just don't.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.343
I didn't come here
to talk about that.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.137
But I want you to know that,

28:00.178 --> 28:03.140
you know, you don't have
to be alone with it either.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.183
I want you to know that.

28:05.183 --> 28:06.518
Oh, thank you.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.520

You have the best barbecue
I've ever tasted in Gatling.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.895
And I swear, if you ever
repeat that to anybody,

28:49.895 --> 28:51.563
I will deny, deny, deny.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.231
But it is‐‐
we don't have anything

28:53.273 --> 28:55.067
that comes close to that
in Dillon.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.068
Oh, we know.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.903
Oh, I'm sure you do.

at the Remington.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.919

move on from there.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.253
And here's another thing‐‐

29:15.253 --> 29:16.213
The Remington
is a five‐star hotel, buddy.

When we bring that entire

is gonna happen,

is gonna be sold out.

is gonna go through the roof.

picked up the phone

29:34.147 --> 29:36.441
and called the hotel
and explained that to them,

29:36.441 --> 29:39.361

37:24.909 --> 37:26.244
[hip‐hop music]

37:26.244 --> 37:27.579
Saracen drops back.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.457
He's got Smash Williams open
on the left for a scream.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.751
Ohh! And he's hit
by Silverio again.

37:32.792 --> 37:34.586
(field announcer)
Silverio again on the side.

37:34.627 --> 37:35.754
(Taylor)
Put him on his back, right now!

37:35.795 --> 37:38.423
You put him on his back!

37:38.423 --> 37:39.591
[whistle blows]

37:39.632 --> 37:40.633
(game announcer)
They have to be careful here,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.260
standing near
their own goal line.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.267
Oh, and Riggins is hit!

37:49.309 --> 37:51.770
He's hit by Silverio
for a safety.

37:51.811 --> 37:55.273
And that is two points
for the Gatling Eagles!

37:55.315 --> 37:57.400
And it may not
be pretty, folks,

37:57.442 --> 37:58.943
but it might be enough, and‐‐

37:58.943 --> 38:00.612
Hold on, hold on.
Looks like‐‐

38:00.653 --> 38:02.781
Looks like Riggins is hurt.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.783
Being helped off the field
by Smash.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.284
And it does not look good.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.953
It has just gone
from bad to worse here

38:08.953 --> 38:10.622
for Coach Taylor.

38:10.663 --> 38:12.624
(girl)
Hey, slut,
Riggins is over here.

38:12.665 --> 38:13.666
(second girl)
Riggins is that way!

38:13.666 --> 38:15.585
(girl)
What are you gonna do, huh?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.629
How was Riggins?
We heard about it.

38:17.670 --> 38:21.466
Hey, Lyla, does Riggins
prefer boxers or briefs?

38:21.466 --> 38:22.801
What are they saying?

38:22.842 --> 38:24.469
I don't know, I can't...

38:24.511 --> 38:25.303
(girl)
Who's next?

38:25.345 --> 38:27.806
Eeny, meeny,
miny, moe!

38:27.806 --> 38:29.307
[all shouting at once]

38:29.349 --> 38:32.435
(girl)
You get around, girl.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.270
Hey!

38:34.312 --> 38:35.313
What was that?

38:35.355 --> 38:36.648
Ohh!

38:36.689 --> 38:38.483
(girl)
Damn, bitch.

38:38.525 --> 38:39.818
What the hell is going on?

38:39.859 --> 38:41.653
[girls laughter]

38:41.653 --> 38:43.321
I don't know.
I'm going down there.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.489
Wait, wait, wait.
This one's me.

38:44.489 --> 38:45.490
This one's me.
This one's me.

38:45.532 --> 38:46.825
I'll be right back, babe.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.493
I'll take care of this.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.828
(game announcer)
25‐yard kickoff return by...

38:49.828 --> 38:51.120
I'll be back.

38:51.162 --> 38:54.457
First and ten, Gatling
from their own 40‐yard‐line.

39:02.382 --> 39:04.843
Honey, what happened
out there?

39:04.843 --> 39:07.679
What's going on?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.849
You gotta tell me, baby.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.810
What is it?

39:15.687 --> 39:18.022
I lost Jason.

39:18.022 --> 39:19.774
What?

39:24.904 --> 39:27.490
I was unfaithful, Daddy.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.081
Well...

39:35.081 --> 39:37.417
[crowd cheering]

39:38.710 --> 39:40.670
We all...

39:40.712 --> 39:41.671
make mistakes.

39:41.713 --> 39:45.383
And we‐‐we grow up.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.886
But you're my little girl.

39:47.927 --> 39:48.761
You're my daughter,

39:48.803 --> 39:51.681
and I want you to always
remember that.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.395
You've never
left a game before.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.898
[sniffles]

39:59.898 --> 40:02.567
It's only a game.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.028
You're my daughter.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.074
All right, offense on me!

40:10.074 --> 40:11.576
On me, listen up now.

40:11.618 --> 40:13.411
Listen, we got
one more shot at this.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.871
Let's make it count.
You understand?

40:14.913 --> 40:15.955
Let's go get 'em!

40:15.955 --> 40:17.624
Let's go!
Let's go!

40:17.665 --> 40:20.710
[cheers and applause]

40:22.128 --> 40:23.713
Riggins!

40:25.465 --> 40:27.926
It's time for you
to give the best you got.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.093
You got one more in you?

40:29.093 --> 40:30.094
Yes, sir.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.846
All right, then.
Let's go.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.937
(game announcer)
Well, this is all
she wrote, folks.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.773
Taylor has 13 seconds
left to work with.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.441
Hold on a second.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.902
The big Tim Riggins
is coming onto the field!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.946
He is really digging deep
here tonight

40:47.946 --> 40:50.114
and showing his teammates
what he's made of.

40:50.114 --> 40:51.741
Way to tough it out, Rig.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.119
All right, Rig.
Do this.

40:55.119 --> 40:56.788
Let's go, gentlemen.
Guys, listen up.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.831
We're going pro, right,
28, shovel.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.500
On one.
Ready?

41:00.541 --> 41:02.126
(game announcer)
Now, the Dillon faithful

41:02.126 --> 41:03.586
are on their feet.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.798
Let's see if Coach Taylor can
put some lipstick on this pig.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.633
Two eight!

41:08.675 --> 41:09.968
(Silverio)
Get ready!

41:10.009 --> 41:11.135
Get ready, Smash!

41:11.177 --> 41:12.804
2! 38!

41:12.845 --> 41:14.430
Hut!

41:15.807 --> 41:17.433
(game announcer)
He pitches it off to Smash!

41:17.475 --> 41:19.102
Oh, and Silverio's got him
in his sights!

41:19.143 --> 41:20.603
Oh! Oh!

41:20.645 --> 41:23.147
And he has laid down
on Tim Riggins!

41:23.189 --> 41:24.649
And he has sprung!

41:24.649 --> 41:25.650
Smash Williams
down the left side!

41:25.692 --> 41:28.945
Do you believe in miracles,
folks?!

41:28.987 --> 41:31.823
Because I just saw one!

41:31.864 --> 41:33.825
Touchdown!
Dillon Panthers!

41:33.866 --> 41:36.661
And that is the ball game!

41:36.661 --> 41:40.039
Dillon wins!
Dillon wins!
