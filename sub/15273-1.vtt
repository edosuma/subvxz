04:35.074 --> 04:37.076
God, you scared me.

04:37.109 --> 04:40.246
Who were you expecting?
Phantom of the Opera?

04:40.279 --> 04:42.849
I'm sorry, I was so
lost in thought.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.653
I think you've been working
too hard on your book

04:47.686 --> 04:48.587
about that witch's night.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.824
Well...

04:51.858 --> 04:54.260
after all, that's what
I'm here to study, right?

04:54.293 --> 04:56.929
Right. Absolutely right.

05:11.143 --> 05:12.578
Well, the tide went down.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.551
When the light is split into prisms,

05:21.220 --> 05:25.357
it travails and the
layers of your pregnancies,

05:25.391 --> 05:28.594
will be transformed into joys
and may they be multiplied.

05:30.562 --> 05:32.398
And let the suffering,
in which you shall

05:32.431 --> 05:35.768
give birth to your children,
become pleasure of the body.

05:35.802 --> 05:37.870
Silly book really has
ahold on you, doesn't it?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.638
This silly book just
happens to be

05:39.671 --> 05:42.208
the source of half the theories
on which I'm basing my book.

05:42.241 --> 05:45.111
Just be the key to the
mystery of the witch's light.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.746
It was written by this really
obscure German writer.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.783
- It's never been translated.
- No wonder.

07:17.236 --> 07:18.670
Miss, you all right?

07:20.006 --> 07:21.240
You all right, miss?

07:21.273 --> 07:22.741
Didn't hit you or anything,
did it?

07:22.774 --> 07:24.410
Yeah, it didn't
hit you coming down.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.578
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah.

07:26.612 --> 07:27.980
No, I'm okay.
Thank you.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.548
- You sure?
- Thank you.

07:29.581 --> 07:30.516
Okay, great.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.407
Please, can I have
my ball back?

08:01.280 --> 08:05.017
- Thank you.
- Till we meet again, Tommy.

08:05.051 --> 08:10.222
- How do you know my name?
- I know a lot of things.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.524
But you better hurry back.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.560
Your sister bought
a present for you.

08:26.472 --> 08:30.042
Gary, I hope you
realize how much I appreciate

08:30.076 --> 08:33.111
you coming here to do these
pictures for my book.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.447
It really means a lot to me
'cause...

08:35.481 --> 08:38.317
I believe in what I'm writing,
but I need proof.

08:38.350 --> 08:41.220
It's just sometimes
I feel confused, even scared

08:41.253 --> 08:42.821
to find what
I'm looking for.

08:42.854 --> 08:46.292
I think you're gettin' a
little carried away here, honey.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.894
You've been stressed out
for weeks now. In my opinion,

08:48.927 --> 08:51.063
all those book you've been
reading on esoteric sciences

08:51.097 --> 08:53.732
are not doing
a damn bit of good.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.434
You know what's weird though?

08:57.003 --> 08:58.104
What?

08:59.871 --> 09:01.473
I studied the hotel
from every angle.

09:03.475 --> 09:05.811
That light we see shining in
the upstairs window at noon,

09:08.180 --> 09:09.815
there doesn't seem to
be anything to cause it.

09:14.653 --> 09:18.790
Hey, thanks for bringing
me here too.

09:18.824 --> 09:21.360
I mean, the place is
absolutely incredible.

09:21.393 --> 09:23.829
I promise I'm gonna get some
really good pictures for you.

09:23.862 --> 09:24.530
Great.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.466
It's also kind of
a nice chance

09:27.499 --> 09:30.802
for us to get away together,
you know, alone?

09:33.205 --> 09:35.107
You know, I've been thinkinga
lot about us lately and...

09:35.141 --> 09:37.276
Oh, here it is.

09:37.309 --> 09:41.213
There's an infantile superstition
of the human spirit.

09:41.247 --> 09:44.383
That virginity can be a
virtue and not the barrier

09:44.416 --> 09:47.153
that separate signorance
from knowledge.

09:47.186 --> 09:50.389
See, even your poet knows
virginity is not natural

09:50.422 --> 09:51.723
for a grown woman.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.732
You know, this could
bethe perfect vacation.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.234
Just don't start, please.

10:04.203 --> 10:07.539
You gotta admit that
beinga virgin at your age

10:07.573 --> 10:09.375
- is just not...
- Just drop it!

10:11.777 --> 10:13.045
Okay?

10:14.113 --> 10:16.548
Okay.
Sorry.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.118
Forget it.

10:25.624 --> 10:28.694
What on earth possessed
you to want to buy this place?

10:28.727 --> 10:30.729
It's a marvelous deal.

10:30.762 --> 10:32.431
Fifty miles from Boston.

10:32.464 --> 10:35.000
The perfect place for a private club.
I mean...

10:35.033 --> 10:36.768
quite exclusive.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.004
Oh, we're gonna
rebuild everything.

10:39.037 --> 10:41.907
Of course, your father has
been skeptical from the start,

10:41.940 --> 10:45.344
but he'll soon see I was right.

10:45.377 --> 10:47.413
I'm going to
make it look fabulous!

10:47.446 --> 10:49.348
Just forget the whole thing.

10:49.381 --> 10:50.749
What, Freddy?

10:50.782 --> 10:53.452
The architect broke
his stupid leg today.

10:53.485 --> 10:56.222
He's at Boston Generalup
to his butt in plaster.

10:56.255 --> 10:59.225
So, no architect,
no site review,

10:59.258 --> 11:00.592
no trip to the island.

11:05.231 --> 11:09.935
Never say die, Freddy.
We'll change architects.

11:09.968 --> 11:13.105
A friend of mine told me
about the most marvelous person.

11:13.139 --> 11:14.740
And the Taylors used
the same one

11:14.773 --> 11:16.608
for that palace of theirs
in Florida.

11:16.642 --> 11:19.010
I know I wrote it down
here somewhere.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.448
Here it is.

11:30.522 --> 11:31.457
Could you get that?

11:38.930 --> 11:41.099
- John, was that the phone?
- No.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.835
- Hello.
- I'll get it.

12:16.868 --> 12:18.437
Hello.

12:18.470 --> 12:20.005
This is Mr. Brooks calling.

12:20.038 --> 12:23.642
We need an estimate on a hotel
my wife is interested in.

12:23.675 --> 12:25.977
And, um... the Taylors
referred us to you.

12:26.011 --> 12:27.379
You said you got my name
from the Taylors?

12:29.014 --> 12:31.049
I don't know anyone
named Taylor.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.954
That would be fine.
I have tomorrow off,

12:35.987 --> 12:37.323
I'll meet you then.

12:37.356 --> 12:38.857
Fine, so we'll see you
tomorrow.

12:38.890 --> 12:41.126
All right. Thank you.

12:41.159 --> 12:42.160
Bye-bye.

12:46.365 --> 12:50.168
- I'm sorry, John.
- I get it.

12:50.202 --> 12:54.673
I have to go.
You have to work.

12:54.706 --> 12:58.176
No.
I want you to stay tonight.

12:59.911 --> 13:03.615
But, um... I can't play
with you tomorrow.

13:05.617 --> 13:06.718
Because I have to work.

13:08.086 --> 13:10.256
I'll never understand
which you love more.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.923
Work or sex.

13:14.793 --> 13:18.129
Well, you of all people
should be able to answer that.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.937
Unruly lust
may be loosed

13:25.971 --> 13:27.473
in the bones of
a seasoned woman.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.045
May virtue be as wax in the
heat of your want on flames.

13:45.557 --> 13:50.028
What if I just kind of
get under the covers?

13:52.230 --> 13:54.733
Come on, be good and go
back to your sleeping bag.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.371
Please.

14:09.848 --> 14:12.718
Seriously, Leslie, I am
really concerned about you.

14:12.751 --> 14:14.520
I think we should
talk about this.

14:16.254 --> 14:17.656
I don't want to talk about it.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.792
I want to go to bed.

14:24.330 --> 14:25.364
Good night, Gary.

14:32.003 --> 14:33.204
Good night, Leslie.

14:59.197 --> 15:01.299
We whispered and we talked...

16:57.415 --> 16:59.985
I'm sorry, I won't be
able to stay and help you.

17:00.018 --> 17:02.954
But my son Jerry will be
able to help you very nicely.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.355
We're one family.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.425
Hope you like the house.
It was nice to meet you.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.428
Nice meeting you, sir.

17:10.462 --> 17:11.930
- Take care. Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.840
I'm supposed to be
showing you the property.

17:25.143 --> 17:26.277
Mr. Brooks.

17:29.047 --> 17:30.782
Mrs. Brooks.

17:30.816 --> 17:33.351
I think you're making a really
great choice here. Um...

17:33.384 --> 17:36.488
Good exposure, all the
rooms have an ocean view.

17:36.522 --> 17:38.824
We even have electricity now.
We just had it hooked up.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.693
And I think you're making
a super investment.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.795
I think you've got a great
nose for business.

17:43.829 --> 17:46.532
Oh, I certainly do.
But, uh...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.535
First we'll see the place
and then we'll decide.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.203
Voracious
and wicked nature,

17:52.237 --> 17:56.041
your greedy appetite
is never sated.

17:56.074 --> 17:59.978
Even before you savored the
fruit in its entirety,

18:00.011 --> 18:00.746
again you desire it.

18:02.480 --> 18:06.284
More than before,
and on into and again.

18:06.317 --> 18:07.052
Without end.

18:11.990 --> 18:13.191
Gary?

18:24.002 --> 18:24.703
Hi!

18:26.538 --> 18:28.139
My name is Sydney,
what's yours?

18:28.173 --> 18:29.675
Tommy.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.176
- Do you live here?
- No,

18:31.209 --> 18:35.180
but my dad wants to buy this
island right there.

18:35.213 --> 18:37.683
You shouldn't live here.
That's a bad place.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.517
My mommy told me
a witch lives there.

18:41.887 --> 18:42.954
Bye, Tommy.

18:54.232 --> 18:55.033
Jane!

19:10.882 --> 19:13.451
Hurry, Gary! It will be
gone in a couple of seconds!

19:33.271 --> 19:34.606
We should try tomorrow
from another angle.

19:37.142 --> 19:38.810
You got your witch's
light on film.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.411
It's fantastic.

19:42.648 --> 19:45.784
God, you look beautiful like that.
Stay right there.

19:47.919 --> 19:49.320
Come on, open your eyes.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.056
Come on, Gary.

19:51.089 --> 19:53.324
Come on, open your eyes.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.926
Stop it! Okay?

20:05.003 --> 20:06.604
- Mr. Brooks?
- Yeah.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.940
I'm sorry I'm late.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.943
I'm sorry. I'm never late. I had
a hell of a time getting here.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.179
Don't give it another thought,
Linda.

20:14.212 --> 20:17.015
- I may call you Linda?
- Oh, sure.

20:17.048 --> 20:21.419
Come on, let's go. We've
already wasted half an hour.

20:21.452 --> 20:24.489
I'm really sorry.
The traffic was terrible!

20:24.522 --> 20:27.125
Now I'm gonna need an estimateon
the cost of the renovation.

20:27.158 --> 20:29.360
But just remember one thing
Miss Donovan.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.262
We are not millionaires.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.197
Yet.

20:45.143 --> 20:46.544
Why was it so difficult to

20:46.577 --> 20:48.880
find someone to
take us to this island?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.784
Oh, you know, sailors are
weird, superstitious.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.653
They've got a bunch of
legends about this island.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.789
Witches and rainbows and shit.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.158
If you want my opinion,

21:00.191 --> 21:02.460
you're gonna make
a killing on this place.

21:02.493 --> 21:06.798
Okay, push this button
here, that will make...

21:06.832 --> 21:09.467
the tape start, so you
can hear music.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.402
Then push stop.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.672
And this button here is so you
can record your own voice.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.074
Jane loves Tommy very much.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.377
Then we can play it back.

21:23.381 --> 21:24.883
Jane loves Tommy very much.

21:35.226 --> 21:38.429
I love you, Jane.
I love you, Jane.

21:38.463 --> 21:42.100
I love you, Jane. I love you, Jane.
I love you, Jane.

21:54.746 --> 21:58.283
- Do you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

21:58.316 --> 22:01.019
That's amazing these
old projectors.

22:01.052 --> 22:02.520
God knows how
this thing got here,

22:02.553 --> 22:03.454
but I'd sure like
to get it to work.

22:09.594 --> 22:12.798
Shit! Somebody is coming.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.300
- So what?
- It's a private island.

22:15.333 --> 22:16.868
I know.

22:16.902 --> 22:17.969
I thought you asked permission

22:18.003 --> 22:19.470
to visit the island
and do research.

22:19.504 --> 22:22.173
- I did.
- So?

22:23.241 --> 22:25.276
They didn't give it to me.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.479
Oh, God, you're a genius
forgetting us into trouble.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.288
Come on.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.093
Listen, if you're not back
here before low tide,

22:42.127 --> 22:43.294
I'm leaving without you.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.563
We'll be back, Sam.
Scout's honor.

22:45.596 --> 22:46.431
I mean it.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.737
Hard-nosed bastard!

22:52.770 --> 22:54.672
Well, it's your own
damn fault, Rose.

22:54.705 --> 22:57.108
If you had given him a decent tip,
he would've softened up.

23:07.652 --> 23:10.121
I thought it was
in better shape!

23:10.155 --> 23:11.756
Oh, don't worry
about that.

23:11.789 --> 23:14.092
A coat of paint and this
place will be good as new.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.626
And look at that view!

23:15.660 --> 23:17.695
Quiet, tranquil, isolated.

23:20.165 --> 23:20.899
Let's have a look inside.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.035
I think you're gonna
change your mind

23:24.069 --> 23:24.970
as soon as
you see the interior.

23:28.840 --> 23:29.807
You know, this place is
quite a find...

23:37.215 --> 23:40.151
Oh, you folks are gonna be very
happy with this investment.

23:40.185 --> 23:41.953
I think with just a few minor
renovations you'll find that...

23:43.821 --> 23:46.892
it virtually pays for itself.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.295
I think in about a year, you'll
be living here rent-free.

23:50.328 --> 23:52.063
Let's take a look at the
grand salon.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.132
You'll find that this room

23:54.165 --> 23:58.036
is quite spacious, as all
the rooms on this floor are.

23:59.370 --> 24:00.671
This place is a wreck!

24:03.674 --> 24:07.145
It's going to cost me a
goddamn fortune to fix it up.

24:07.178 --> 24:09.380
That you bought for a sumway below....

24:09.414 --> 24:10.882
below market value.

24:13.284 --> 24:14.019
It was a lucky coincidence.

24:15.686 --> 24:17.855
The owners were
desperate to sell.

24:17.889 --> 24:19.891
In fact, had they given
us any kind of a time frame,

24:19.925 --> 24:21.559
we could've gotten
double what we paid for it.

24:23.895 --> 24:26.998
We were very shrewd to grabit
when we did, sight unseen.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.367
You really think so?

24:29.400 --> 24:30.969
You think I don't know?
No doubt about it.

24:33.939 --> 24:35.773
Well, now let's go check out
that kitchen.

24:35.806 --> 24:39.377
It's newly renovated,
pipes and wiring,

24:39.410 --> 24:42.613
has a wonderful double
gas stove and a really...

24:54.092 --> 24:56.794
This house shouldn't
cost that much to rebuild.

24:56.827 --> 24:59.030
The structure has good bones.

24:59.064 --> 25:03.701
Well, maybe so, but it
looks like a lot of work to me.

25:03.734 --> 25:06.404
This place
gives me the shivers.

25:06.437 --> 25:08.473
Don't worry about that. Have the
heating fixed up in a snap.

25:51.049 --> 25:55.353
- You live here?
- Nobody lives here, Tommy.

25:55.386 --> 25:57.188
Nobody.

26:07.365 --> 26:08.666
Just figures these people
would turn up today.

26:10.868 --> 26:13.938
They couldn't wait until tomorrow,
we're leaving anyway.

26:13.971 --> 26:15.806
I think we should just
make a run for it.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.144
Got plenty of pictures, jump
in the Zodiac, out of here.

26:19.177 --> 26:21.012
They'll nail us and
figure we're thieves.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.249
That's a dumb idea.

26:25.150 --> 26:26.884
That's a dumb idea.

26:26.917 --> 26:29.120
What do you suggest?

26:29.154 --> 26:33.124
- Let's wait until they leave.
- Shit!

26:33.158 --> 26:34.325
The hot plate.

26:36.327 --> 26:38.563
It's still hot.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.198
Someone's been here,
just now.

26:42.167 --> 26:43.201
Or...

26:45.236 --> 26:47.538
someone lives here.

26:47.572 --> 26:51.876
It's impossible. I assure
you, nobody has been here.

26:51.909 --> 26:53.778
Besides, my father would
have told me.

27:45.763 --> 27:48.466
No one's lived here for years.
Years!

27:48.499 --> 27:51.102
The last person,
that's what they say,

27:51.136 --> 27:54.405
was a woman, a movie actress.

27:54.439 --> 27:57.475
She was shooting a picture here
and fell in love with the place.

27:57.508 --> 28:01.212
I mean, really, let's face it.
This is a wonderful building.

28:01.246 --> 28:03.814
Have you ever seen
such elegance?

28:03.848 --> 28:07.318
Anyway, I guess she decided
to pack it in and stay here.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.619
- Alone?
- Well, that I don't know.

28:10.355 --> 28:13.558
All I know is she must
have been a little crazy.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.226
My father remembers her.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.662
He saw her in the movies
when he was a kid.

28:17.695 --> 28:22.633
In the end, she was kind of
like, um... like Gloria Swanson.

28:22.667 --> 28:24.269
In Sunset Boulevard.

28:24.302 --> 28:29.106
Well, if this is her, got to
give her credit. Not bad.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.776
They say at a certain point
she quit the movies all together,

28:31.809 --> 28:35.112
because she didn't want
people to see her getting old.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.615
Her last picture never even
came out!

28:37.648 --> 28:39.016
I guess she
paid off the producers

28:39.049 --> 28:39.850
not to put it on the market.

28:41.786 --> 28:45.956
At any rate, by the time
she retired, she was already...

28:45.990 --> 28:47.858
retirement age.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.594
She couldn't possibly
still be alive.

28:49.627 --> 28:50.661
And if she were?

29:35.039 --> 29:36.274
Aah!

30:19.950 --> 30:20.985
Oh!

32:34.385 --> 32:38.022
No! My baby.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.929
What are you talking about,
dear?

32:44.962 --> 32:48.365
Jane, calm down, honey.

32:48.399 --> 32:50.134
- What happened?
- I... I don't know.

32:52.770 --> 32:53.904
I don't know.

32:57.107 --> 32:59.276
It's like something pulled me
down in there.

33:01.912 --> 33:05.450
Are you okay now? Come on
downstairs and we'll lie down.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.918
I don't know what happened,
but I am not crazy!

33:18.262 --> 33:19.930
Uh, the tide's going out.

33:19.964 --> 33:21.899
I think we'd all better
get back to the boat.

33:21.932 --> 33:24.635
Yes, good idea. I think I've had
enough of this island.

33:32.577 --> 33:35.780
- Hey, they're leaving.
- Great!

33:38.082 --> 33:39.416
I think I have enough
for my book.

33:39.450 --> 33:41.586
I don't feel like hanging
around here anymore.

33:41.619 --> 33:44.922
- Let's just go.
- Okay.

33:44.955 --> 33:47.458
I'll go get the hot plate,
unless they made off with it.

33:49.694 --> 33:52.129
Now what do we do?
I told you to tip him!

33:53.864 --> 33:56.133
Jane isn't well, we have
to get back to Boston.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.736
Daddy, I'm all right.
Don't worry.

33:58.769 --> 34:02.573
But I want to get off
the island right now!

34:02.607 --> 34:05.409
Sir, I just don't think
that's feasible right now.

34:05.442 --> 34:07.011
Why don't we all go back
in the house and wait?

34:07.044 --> 34:08.779
When my father finds out
we're not back yet,

34:08.813 --> 34:10.246
he'll take care of everything.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.483
I certainly hope so.

34:12.516 --> 34:15.152
You know, this is all your fault,
you trusted that idiot.

34:17.788 --> 34:19.989
Nice lady, huh?

34:20.024 --> 34:21.859
Don't envy you having to work
with her for the next 6 months.

34:27.498 --> 34:31.536
She told me she lived
here for years and years.

34:31.569 --> 34:35.105
But I met her yesterday
in a park.

34:35.139 --> 34:36.940
What did she look like?

34:36.974 --> 34:39.009
Pretty old
and dressed in black.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.311
Look, there she is,
the woman in black.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.692
- Oops!
- Who are you?

34:54.725 --> 34:56.726
Uh... Hi, my name is Gary.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.697
I'm a photographer and I came to
the island with a friend of mine

34:59.730 --> 35:02.232
to shoot some pictures of
that crazy witch's light.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.168
You know very well that
this is private property

35:04.201 --> 35:06.003
and you're not supposed to
be here without permission.

35:06.036 --> 35:08.338
- What witch's light?
- Oh, nothing.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.140
It's an old wives' tale.

35:10.174 --> 35:11.942
Told you, people in this area
have very weird superstitions.

35:23.788 --> 35:26.557
And that's why I was determined
to visit this island.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.426
It's a mystery which
fascinates me.

35:29.459 --> 35:30.761
Oh, all right. What the hell?

35:33.030 --> 35:35.833
Goddamn it, the mystery now is
how to get off this island!

35:35.866 --> 35:39.604
I can help you there.
My Zodiac is parked outside.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.739
Obviously, we can't all fit.
But, uh...

35:41.772 --> 35:44.208
I can make a run,
send somebody back.

35:44.241 --> 35:45.776
Just look at that sea.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.477
We'll never get off this
island in no rubber dinghy.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.049
Don't worry anybody.

35:52.082 --> 35:54.384
As soon as my dad realizes
we are not back yet,

35:54.418 --> 35:56.053
he'll take care of everything.

35:56.086 --> 35:58.789
Great. Meanwhile, why don't
I do the honors of the house

35:58.823 --> 36:00.224
and rustle up some coffee.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.637
Umm...
I doubt if that's working.

36:14.839 --> 36:15.606
How did you guess?

36:20.611 --> 36:23.580
Okay, you can go home now.
I'm gonna stay for a while.

36:31.321 --> 36:32.256
Good night.

36:39.329 --> 36:40.998
Mrs. Brooks, would you
like some coffee?

36:41.031 --> 36:42.332
She better not.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.235
We don't want to strain
my wife's nerves.

36:45.269 --> 36:46.871
My nerves are just fine!

36:48.138 --> 36:49.306
A stinking lousy headache.

36:51.341 --> 36:53.811
That's foul!

36:53.844 --> 36:56.313
Well, if you really don't feel
well, why don't you go upstairs

36:56.346 --> 36:57.281
and lie down for a while.

36:58.548 --> 37:00.150
After all, it is a hotel.

37:00.184 --> 37:01.451
Jane, give me one of your pills.

37:06.991 --> 37:08.793
My pills, I had them
when I was....

37:12.229 --> 37:13.664
When I fainted in the bathroom.

37:13.698 --> 37:16.300
Well then, they must
still be there.

37:16.333 --> 37:19.069
- I'll go get them.
- Thank you, Tommy.

37:49.867 --> 37:51.435
Looking for this?

37:53.838 --> 37:54.604
Yes, thank you.

37:59.777 --> 38:04.214
- Do you wanna meet my parents?
- No, not yet, Tommy.

38:04.248 --> 38:05.049
There's no hurry.

38:09.353 --> 38:12.022
See, I was right.
It fell on the floor

38:12.056 --> 38:13.423
and Tommy found them right away.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.993
No, the woman in black
gave them to me.

38:16.026 --> 38:17.561
Stop this nonsense!
You hear me?

38:22.232 --> 38:25.502
Tommy, come here.
You're a good boy, okay?

38:25.535 --> 38:26.703
Look at me.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.441
I'm gonna get some rest,
somewhere.

38:35.379 --> 38:39.183
God knows how long
we're gonna be stranded here.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.659
Oh, I wouldn't mind if we have
to spend the whole night here.

38:51.595 --> 38:52.830
Would you?

40:55.852 --> 40:57.821
So, in just a few more months,

40:57.854 --> 41:00.524
you're gonna have a niece
or nephew to play with.

41:00.557 --> 41:02.592
- Does that make you happy?
- Yes.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.362
I have to go to the bathroom.

41:05.395 --> 41:07.031
Do you know where it is?

41:07.064 --> 41:08.532
- Yes.
- Okay.

41:25.549 --> 41:28.085
So, do you believe in
paranormal phenomena?

41:28.118 --> 41:29.686
What do you mean?

41:29.719 --> 41:33.857
Well, do you study professionally
or is it a hobby?

41:33.890 --> 41:38.528
You know, witches, spirits,
spells, unexplainable events.

41:38.562 --> 41:40.530
Yeah, I studied it for
so many years,

41:40.564 --> 41:42.099
I definitely believe in it.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.701
What does this island
have to do with it?

41:44.734 --> 41:46.103
Because they say on this island

41:46.136 --> 41:48.038
many witch burnings
have taken place.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.940
And the book
you're translating?

41:49.974 --> 41:52.376
Oh, it's an old German text,

41:52.409 --> 41:53.777
about a woman
accused of witchcraft.

41:55.312 --> 41:57.747
She was pregnant.

41:57.781 --> 41:59.649
And so preferred
to take her own life,

41:59.683 --> 42:01.551
rather than burn at the stake.

42:01.585 --> 42:04.588
And all this took place on
anisland in a new world.

42:04.621 --> 42:05.990
It was exactly like this one.

42:22.372 --> 42:24.141
I didn't touch it. I swear.

43:31.741 --> 43:34.711
There's three doors to hell.

43:34.744 --> 43:38.215
The first door needs to grieve.

43:40.584 --> 43:44.421
That one will be closed
now forever.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.061
Oh, it's so cold!

46:39.863 --> 46:42.432
There's a fireplace.
Why don't we use it?

46:42.466 --> 46:45.535
It'll keep us warm
while we wait.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.271
That sounds like
a good idea.

46:49.306 --> 46:50.307
That chair looks
just like the thing.

47:09.659 --> 47:12.061
Don't tell your wife. She will
probably make me pay for it.

47:45.695 --> 47:48.164
There's a lot of smoke.

47:48.197 --> 47:49.733
You know, it probably
hasn't been used in years.

47:49.766 --> 47:51.134
It's a storm. Low pressure.

48:29.339 --> 48:30.574
It's beginning to drop now.

49:03.607 --> 49:04.874
That is really pretty.

49:06.576 --> 49:08.211
- Is it old?
- I don't know.

49:10.847 --> 49:12.582
- Do you wear it all the time?
- Mm-hmm.

49:15.619 --> 49:16.553
Even in bed?

49:23.026 --> 49:25.361
I want to go look for Tommy,
maybe he's with Rose.

49:25.395 --> 49:27.564
You go, I want to read this.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.943
I'm gonna go stretch out,
getting kind of tired.

49:39.976 --> 49:42.712
Yeah, I think I'll
do the same thing.

49:42.746 --> 49:44.648
Safe to say, we're stuck
here for the night.

49:46.382 --> 49:48.384
Mr. Brooks...

49:48.418 --> 49:50.787
will you come and knock on my door
when the cavalry gets here?

49:50.820 --> 49:52.055
Sure will.

49:52.088 --> 49:54.123
Thanks. Good night.

50:02.398 --> 50:05.234
I'd like to know what
that chair was made out of.

50:05.268 --> 50:06.603
Wood sure smells funny.

50:09.238 --> 50:10.239
It's colder tonight.

51:05.629 --> 51:06.896
Stop!

51:17.707 --> 51:18.508
Gary, wait!

51:22.311 --> 51:23.580
Tommy?

51:38.595 --> 51:39.362
Tommy?

53:08.952 --> 53:11.320
Oh, my goodness, not again!

53:11.354 --> 53:13.289
A hundred rooms
and not one bed.

53:15.291 --> 53:16.359
Who needs a bed?

55:29.893 --> 55:32.161
- Where did everybody go?
- I don't know.

55:34.330 --> 55:36.900
Tommy, where have you been?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

56:01.257 --> 56:03.626
You know better
than that, Tony.

56:03.659 --> 56:05.294
Those are killer waves out there.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.497
If it'd make you feel any better,

56:08.531 --> 56:12.301
I'll take a spin around,
see if I can find Sam.

56:12.335 --> 56:14.337
I don't know what's
bothering you.

56:14.370 --> 56:15.704
They're in a hotel.

56:17.340 --> 56:18.942
Are you getting superstitious
on me, huh?

57:17.500 --> 57:21.837
The second door,
is the door of lust,

57:21.871 --> 57:25.374
which is the desire
of the flesh.

57:25.408 --> 57:26.943
There's always a flame.

57:58.641 --> 58:00.243
Where are we?
What the hell is going on?

58:02.946 --> 58:04.113
How is this possible?

59:07.343 --> 59:08.311
Linda?

59:14.150 --> 59:15.118
Linda?

59:16.352 --> 59:17.753
Linda?

59:21.657 --> 59:23.459
Giordano? Linda?

59:28.164 --> 59:29.632
Where the devil are you?

59:47.916 --> 59:49.152
Linda?

59:52.088 --> 59:53.422
Linda!

59:55.091 --> 59:57.060
Linda. Linda!

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:09.872
Linda!

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.344
Oh, dear God in heaven.

01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:28.624
Giordano?

01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:33.362
Linda?

01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:50.946
Linda!

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.048
Linda!

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:05.261
Sam you say? No, I don't
think he's at the island.

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:07.096
They saw his boat going in
the opposite direction

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.464
this afternoon!

01:01:08.497 --> 01:01:10.799
Are you sure
it was Sam's boat?

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:14.603
I didn't see it myself, but
the Foxy Lady is hard to mistake.

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.905
Would you take me to the
island in your boat?

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:20.143
I'm afraid my son
is stuck out there.

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.545
I am sorry, Mr. Giordano,

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:24.947
but it would be suicide to
try to go out there now.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.284
- It's blowing up a storm!
- I'll pay you anything.

01:01:28.317 --> 01:01:29.618
I wouldn't live to spend it.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.926
You know, Tommy, when I was
a kid, I was just like you.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.464
I had lots of friends
and I'd talk to them,

01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:44.167
and sometimes they'd
talk back to me.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.569
And I did all the voices
just like you.

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:50.473
Only I never had this old
lady who was dressed in black.

01:01:50.506 --> 01:01:52.575
There was one guy named
Captain Nemo,

01:01:52.608 --> 01:01:55.511
and Captain Nemo
was a big, fat dude.

01:01:55.544 --> 01:01:57.946
He was so fat, when
he sat around the house,

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.382
- he sat around the...
- Gary?

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.686
Did you get it?
Around the house?

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.354
I'll be right back.
Do not forget it.

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:08.824
Yo, what's up?

01:02:08.857 --> 01:02:10.326
The strangest
thing just happened.

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.888
The room went suddenly dark.

01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:15.324
And I walked in and
they were gone!

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:16.259
Maybe they just wanted
to be alone.

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:23.198
Jesus Christ! Help me get
her down, will you?

01:04:05.274 --> 01:04:06.675
Blood of a virgin...

01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:55.611
Jerry?

01:07:02.751 --> 01:07:04.019
Um... what's that?

01:07:29.645 --> 01:07:32.748
It's Jerry. We've gotta
get outta here.

01:07:32.781 --> 01:07:36.418
- We've gotta get out of here!
- Stop! Stop! Stop it!

01:07:36.451 --> 01:07:37.553
Leslie!

01:07:56.004 --> 01:07:57.372
Leslie?

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.408
Thank God, you're all right!

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:02.645
All right, listen to me.

01:08:04.813 --> 01:08:07.215
Linda and Jerry
have been killed.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.317
Now, you get dressed. We've
got to find a way out of here.

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:31.840
The upside down
cross where Jerry was burned,

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:33.008
and Linda's slashed throat.

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:37.078
It's all part of
an ancient ritual.

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.551
A satanic ritual.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.256
Where's Rose?

01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:53.862
She may be in trouble,
we have to go look for her.

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:07.876
Ah!

01:09:49.752 --> 01:09:53.154
We're trapped!
We're trapped in this place.

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:55.223
Gary, we've got to
get off this island!

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:57.425
We'll never make it
in the Zodiac.

01:09:57.459 --> 01:10:00.663
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:01.864
Maybe we can get
a message out.

01:10:20.015 --> 01:10:21.016
Hold this.

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:23.819
I got it.

01:10:30.558 --> 01:10:32.861
Damn it!
They're soaking wet!

01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:37.800
Here, use this.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:41.804
Thanks.

01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:20.542
Lets pray someone is out there
to see this.

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:28.183
All right! Come on,
let's get back inside.

01:11:28.216 --> 01:11:29.918
I am worried about the others.

01:11:53.608 --> 01:11:55.710
- Dad?
- What do you want?

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.045
Why aren't you in bed?

01:11:57.079 --> 01:11:59.414
Somebody is sending signals
from the island.

01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:01.884
Jesus, if you didn't watch
those cruddy movies,

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:04.019
you wouldn't be
getting nightmares.

01:12:04.052 --> 01:12:06.288
- Ah, Dad, listen!
- You listen.

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.655
You go to bed.
You need your sleep.

01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:46.688
Doesn't make any sense.
It's just...

01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:49.457
incomprehensible sounds.

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:52.727
No, let me hear it again,
it sounds like German.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.030
You know, this could be the
key to what is going on here.

01:13:59.367 --> 01:14:02.170
My son and those other
people are in danger!

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.739
I saw that flare with
my very eyes.

01:14:04.772 --> 01:14:07.809
- You have to do something.
- No. No.

01:14:07.842 --> 01:14:11.213
I believe you, but how
can I get out there?

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.748
God almighty can't even
handle that sea.

01:14:13.781 --> 01:14:17.485
Well, think of something!
My son could be in danger.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.587
You don't want that on
your conscience.

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.191
Fire from the greedy...

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.729
Lust from the harlot...

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:33.101
Fruit of the woman in labor.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:38.473
And the blood of a virgin.

01:14:42.577 --> 01:14:45.047
These are all
elements of witchcraft.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.449
There is a common denominatorin
all the mystery cults.

01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.488
Blood of a virgin.

01:15:24.652 --> 01:15:26.088
'F' for fear.

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:29.791
'B' for blood.

01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:51.980
Seems to be a
very unusual kind of spell.

01:15:54.882 --> 01:15:56.618
You all right?

01:15:56.651 --> 01:15:58.086
It's nothing.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.854
What do you think
it means?

01:15:59.887 --> 01:16:01.656
What do you think it means?

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:11.366
I really don't know.

01:16:11.399 --> 01:16:13.868
I really don't know.

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:41.896
Brooks? Mr. Brooks.

01:17:04.386 --> 01:17:05.753
Dad, what's wrong?

01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.038
Mr. Brooks!

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:39.654
It's okay.

01:17:48.996 --> 01:17:51.099
Gary. Gary!

01:18:00.975 --> 01:18:02.444
All right. Okay.

01:18:33.308 --> 01:18:34.509
Ughh!

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:18.152
Listen. Listen.

01:19:34.101 --> 01:19:36.037
It worked! It's a helicopter.

01:20:10.938 --> 01:20:12.874
Come on.

01:20:12.907 --> 01:20:14.609
I don't see anything.

01:20:14.642 --> 01:20:15.777
I don't see any boat.

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:34.729
Hey! Hey!

01:20:37.164 --> 01:20:39.000
Move. Move!

01:21:09.964 --> 01:21:10.932
Hey!

01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:23.711
Hey!

01:21:37.825 --> 01:21:38.960
Hey!

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:52.707
Hey!

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:58.713
Wind's comin' up.

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:01.015
We better head back.

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:06.187
No place we can land now anyway.

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.393
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:22:25.206 --> 01:22:26.107
Hey!

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:33.415
Wait a minute. I saw something.

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.927
Hey!

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:57.405
There's something there.

01:23:01.275 --> 01:23:02.910
No! I don't see anything.

01:23:04.712 --> 01:23:07.181
I thought I caught a flash
of something.

01:23:07.214 --> 01:23:08.783
But I guess it was
just a reflection.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:36.911
They probably already
landed down the coast a bit.

01:23:36.944 --> 01:23:39.981
Go home. Your son will be
waiting for you.

01:23:45.352 --> 01:23:46.287
Hey!

01:23:56.964 --> 01:23:58.299
They're leaving.

01:23:58.332 --> 01:24:00.267
Oh, God, help us,
they're leaving!

01:24:21.455 --> 01:24:22.857
God, what do we do now?

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.165
Look, there she is, the
woman in black!

01:24:38.239 --> 01:24:41.242
All right, stay here.
Stay here. Stay together.

01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.081
Hey, wait Gary!

01:24:53.087 --> 01:24:54.188
That's not her.

01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:04.566
Gary? Look!

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.602
The window's not broken anymore.

01:25:10.538 --> 01:25:11.739
Come on!

01:26:21.575 --> 01:26:22.977
I've been waiting for you.

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:30.584
I chose you all carefully.

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:34.689
Your weak souls are the
source of my existence.

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:42.229
And this body, a vessel
that shall contain them,

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:43.665
and carry out my tasks.

01:26:46.033 --> 01:26:47.334
Come on, Jane,
let's get out of here.

01:26:51.605 --> 01:26:55.042
There are three doors
to the dark side.

01:26:56.978 --> 01:27:00.782
Lust, avarice and ire.

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:08.656
Linda for the lust,
and Rose for greed,

01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:12.059
and ire of the persecuted witch.

01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:15.897
Add Jane's baby,

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:24.105
and the one element that unites
and completes the rest.

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:28.175
The loss of purity.
Yours does it.

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:32.646
- It's locked...
- Let's go!

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:37.745
Shit! Tommy.

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:40.882
- He's with Jane.
- You get the Zodiac ready.

01:28:40.915 --> 01:28:42.249
I'll be back. Go!

01:28:58.599 --> 01:28:59.834
Tommy?
Oh!

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:09.643
Tommy?

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:30.264
Tommy?

01:29:48.515 --> 01:29:50.717
Tommy! Tommy...

01:29:53.387 --> 01:29:54.355
Tommy!

01:30:04.866 --> 01:30:05.867
Aah!

01:30:11.338 --> 01:30:12.139
Aah!

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.541
Ugh...

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:41.869
Gary?

01:30:45.039 --> 01:30:45.873
Tommy?

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:51.245
It's me, Leslie, it's Gary.

01:30:51.278 --> 01:30:52.746
Oh, thank God!

01:32:27.441 --> 01:32:28.642
Jane!

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:32.813
No, Tommy!
It's not Jane!

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:36.650
No, Tommy!

01:32:55.902 --> 01:32:56.970
Oh!

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:06.980
I love you, Jane.

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:12.686
I love you, Jane. I love you, Jane.
I love you, Jane.

01:33:12.719 --> 01:33:21.362
I love you, Jane. I love you, Jane.
I love you, Jane.

01:33:48.422 --> 01:33:51.392
Good news. Tommy is fine,
you can leave the hospital.

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:53.060
You don't have to worry.

01:33:53.094 --> 01:33:54.295
It won't have
any effect on the baby.

01:33:56.097 --> 01:33:57.964
My baby?
