02:56.911 --> 02:58.641
oh!

04:38.311 --> 04:40.651
what is it about the dark

04:40.648 --> 04:43.718
that makes you
afraid, phil?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.517
i don't know
exactly.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.460
i'm just scared
there's something there

04:50.457 --> 04:51.757
that i can't see.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.459
hmm. do you know
what that might be?

04:54.461 --> 04:55.531
if i knew that,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.859
i probably wouldn't
be afraid of it.

04:57.865 --> 05:01.925
i guess that's
what you mean, right?

05:05.538 --> 05:06.968
sometimes
the hardest part

05:06.974 --> 05:09.544
is admitting
to yourself

05:09.543 --> 05:10.983
that something
exists

05:10.978 --> 05:13.748
which makes you
frightened.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.810
what made you afraid

05:15.816 --> 05:18.546
when you
were a little boy?

05:19.652 --> 05:22.052
you can't
tell anybody this.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.730
i had this nightmare
that wouldn't go away.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.473
michelle, for god's sake,
what are you doing?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.470
i'm in session.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.642
it's grandma.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.741
if there's
anything else

06:16.744 --> 06:18.884
i can do,
let me know.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.149

06:21.148 --> 06:24.018

06:35.728 --> 06:38.728
your grandma was
such a sweet lady.

right?

06:52.645 --> 06:54.175

it's michelle.

06:54.181 --> 06:58.181
my dad's the only one
that calls me 'shel.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.015
how did you
know her?

07:01.021 --> 07:02.491
she was
our employer.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.559
we cleaned her house
every week.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.929
anyway, we're
really sorry.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.429

07:10.431 --> 07:11.501

07:11.498 --> 07:13.628

being here today.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.834
we need to talk
about your mother.

07:15.836 --> 07:16.966
i'm sorry.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.500
i don't think
i know you.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.766
you know me.

07:26.946 --> 07:27.946
i don't think i do.

07:27.948 --> 07:31.778
you know there is
still evil here.

07:45.031 --> 07:46.501
who was that?

07:46.500 --> 07:50.070
a very
troubled man.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.570
he said that
you know him.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.114
we should get back
to our guests.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.251
â™ş he's a demon...

time.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.010
mrs. porter said

that's my daughter michelle.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.793
oh, you're
very pretty.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.720
i meant that
at your daughter.

09:19.726 --> 09:20.756
steve,

09:20.761 --> 09:22.261
mrs. porter
passed away.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.162
she was
my mother.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.104
we're here to close up the house.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.600
oh, but i mow
the lawn,

09:29.603 --> 09:32.173
and when mrs. porter
comes back,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.642
she'll want
the lawn mowed.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.041
no. she's not
coming back.

09:36.043 --> 09:37.843
how about
letting us sleep

09:37.844 --> 09:39.954
while you mow someone else's lawn,

09:39.947 --> 09:43.007
and then you finish
this lawn later?

09:43.016 --> 09:46.916
but mrs. porter said
the lawn is to be mowed

09:46.920 --> 09:49.650
exactly at 7:30.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.656
yeah.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.691

09:55.862 --> 09:57.962
o.k.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.155

09:59.166 --> 10:02.766
â™ş here he comes,
here comes speed racer â™ş

10:02.769 --> 10:04.339
â™ş he's a demon on wheels

10:04.338 --> 10:08.808

chasing after someone â™ş

10:08.809 --> 10:11.839
â™ş here he comes,
here comes... â™ş

10:12.311 --> 10:15.151
this house kind of
gives me the creeps.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.348
how long do you think
we'll be staying here?

10:18.352 --> 10:20.792
uh-huh.

10:20.787 --> 10:23.017
that's good.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.123
a few days?
a week?

10:25.125 --> 10:28.185
yeah, probably.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.729
is this you?

10:33.933 --> 10:35.203
ha ha ha!

10:35.202 --> 10:36.232
what's so funny?

10:36.236 --> 10:38.996
nothing. it's just
that you look

10:39.006 --> 10:40.666
a little...

10:40.674 --> 10:41.774
what?

10:41.775 --> 10:44.375
you look
a little goofy.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.054
i was 13.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.907
i <i>wa</i> goofy.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.731
yeah.

11:03.362 --> 11:07.802
how come we never came to see grandma that much?

11:07.801 --> 11:11.141
oh, i don't know.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.798
you get
so wrapped up

11:12.806 --> 11:15.006
in your own things.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.282
dad...

11:18.844 --> 11:20.954
it's o.k. if you
don't want to talk

11:20.947 --> 11:23.307
about what's
on your mind,

11:23.316 --> 11:24.446
but you can
tell me that

11:24.451 --> 11:27.991
instead of pretending
it's something else.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.255
are you
analyzing me?

11:33.427 --> 11:35.087
uh-oh.

14:54.126 --> 14:56.326
oh, nothing.
i was just thinking.

14:56.329 --> 15:00.399

15:01.500 --> 15:05.900

17:26.178 --> 17:29.408

why people eat pork.

17:41.527 --> 17:42.787
hi.

17:42.796 --> 17:45.826
i know this is
kind of last minute,

17:45.832 --> 17:47.372
but we were
wondering if--

17:47.367 --> 17:48.497
we're going to
the diner tonight.

17:48.501 --> 17:51.401
we thought you might
want to join us.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.474
that's really nice
of you, but--

17:54.474 --> 17:56.374
we want to
hang out with you

17:56.376 --> 17:58.506
before you go home
for your birthday.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.741
i have a mess
in here.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.576
you can clean up
after newton later.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.752
no. you don't
unders--

18:04.751 --> 18:07.621
how did you know
about newton,

18:07.620 --> 18:11.360
and how did you know
about my birthday?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.827
uh...

18:13.827 --> 18:17.727
some people think
it's really creepy,

18:17.730 --> 18:20.260
but really she's o.k.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.296
we'll help you.

18:25.804 --> 18:29.774
what did he get into
this time?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.882
the entire kitchen.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.884
it wa--it--it...

18:39.886 --> 18:43.616
i was just in here,
and there was...

18:44.156 --> 18:47.456
he--he'd eaten all...

18:47.893 --> 18:50.363
it was
a total wreck.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.803
your grandmother
loved him,

18:51.798 --> 18:54.568
but pigs
can be so messy.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.867
no. you don't
understand.

18:55.869 --> 18:59.199
it was a wreck.
it was a total--

18:59.205 --> 19:00.535
pigsty?
ha ha ha!

19:00.540 --> 19:04.710
i think you need
a milk shake.

19:14.553 --> 19:15.823
the star.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.222
she is such a show-off.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.524
if she weren't
my best friend,

19:19.526 --> 19:21.686
we'd have to burn her at the stake.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.460
can i have
another coke?

19:26.466 --> 19:28.766
right away.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.338
let's do it again.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.538
the fool.

19:38.545 --> 19:44.215
anyone need an attitude adjustment?

19:44.217 --> 19:45.877
no.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.288
mmm.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.195

20:21.520 --> 20:24.520
well, hello.

20:25.624 --> 20:27.864
the lovers.

20:28.493 --> 20:30.603
unmistakably
the lovers.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.827
it's the one on top

20:31.831 --> 20:34.901
that you should
look out for.

20:41.907 --> 20:43.367
that's pretty good.

20:43.376 --> 20:44.836
you must be
new around here.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.584
we know
most of the guys

20:46.579 --> 20:47.909
around glenrock.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.984
yes. i'm sure we do.

20:50.984 --> 20:54.694

20:54.687 --> 20:58.457
this is jules,
and this--

20:58.458 --> 20:59.618
michelle, right?

20:59.626 --> 21:00.886

21:00.893 --> 21:02.933
i heard about
your grandmother.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.459
i'm... i'm so sorry.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.374
thanks.
how did you know?

21:07.466 --> 21:10.026
oh, this is
a small town.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.866
news travels fast.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.741
are you going
to be here for long?

21:14.741 --> 21:15.841
um...

21:15.842 --> 21:17.842
just a few days,
i think.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.314
michelle's turning 18 next week,

21:19.312 --> 21:21.652
so she's got to get back and celebrate.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.708
oh, well, i'm sure
we could come up

21:23.716 --> 21:27.316
with an exciting
celebration for you

21:27.320 --> 21:30.050
maybe you could leave
michelle your number,

21:30.056 --> 21:32.486
and she can call you
if she's interested.

21:32.492 --> 21:35.832
that's a great idea.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.456
do you mind
if i sit down?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.665
sure.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.709
wow, that's a really
cool necklace.

21:47.707 --> 21:50.777
you like it?
check it out.

21:55.747 --> 21:57.547
it's beautiful.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.720
it's yours.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.748
oh, no.
i can't keep this.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.724
sure, you can.
looks great on you.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.894
consider it an early
birthday present.

22:09.895 --> 22:13.595
don't we have to go
do that--that thing?

22:13.599 --> 22:15.399
what thing?

22:15.401 --> 22:17.571
you know--that thing.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.669
no.
i don't remember us

22:19.672 --> 22:22.812
having to do
anything

22:22.809 --> 22:25.339
except
hang out here.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.105
well,

22:26.112 --> 22:28.682
i guess i should
be going.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.011
have
a great time

22:30.016 --> 22:32.416
doing
that thing.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.394
catch you later.

22:36.021 --> 22:39.121
i have two words
for you--

22:39.125 --> 22:40.655
"shut" and "up"!

22:40.660 --> 22:43.830
i have one word
for you--"psycho."

22:43.830 --> 22:47.000
i thought
he was cute!

22:46.999 --> 22:49.699
he forgot his watch.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.465
it doesn't
work, though.

22:54.474 --> 22:56.874
it looks like it's yours now, honey.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.576
â™ş chasing
after someone â™ş

23:08.587 --> 23:12.387
â™ş and he's coming...

24:24.229 --> 24:26.759
<i>hey,</i>
<i>check this out.</i>

24:26.766 --> 24:28.066
<i>oh, yeah.</i>
<i>that's great.</i>

24:28.067 --> 24:30.127
<i>maybe you should</i>
<i>join the circus.</i>

24:30.136 --> 24:31.636
<i>shut up.</i>

24:31.637 --> 24:33.937
<i>hey, check it out.</i>

24:33.940 --> 24:36.140
<i>you've seen</i>
<i>your sister naked,</i>

24:36.142 --> 24:39.882
<i>but have you ever</i>
<i>seen her boinking?</i>

24:41.514 --> 24:43.754
<i>let's go.</i>

24:48.153 --> 24:50.923
<i>shh.</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:57.664
<i>shh.</i>

25:17.082 --> 25:20.752
<i>you looking</i>
<i>for something?</i>

25:21.019 --> 25:24.619
<i>we were just...</i>
<i>we were just...</i>

25:24.624 --> 25:25.894
<i>just getting lost,</i>
<i>right?</i>

25:25.892 --> 25:27.292
<i>yeah. just</i>
<i>getting lost.</i>

25:27.293 --> 25:30.233
<i>jon, let's get</i>
<i>out of here.</i>

25:32.797 --> 25:34.827
<i>come on! bfp.</i>

25:34.834 --> 25:36.634
<i>let's go.</i>

25:36.636 --> 25:41.606
<i>i'll catch up</i>
<i>to you later.</i>

25:46.678 --> 25:49.208
<i>protecting</i>
<i>your sister.</i>

25:49.814 --> 25:52.184
<i>that's cool.</i>
<i>i like that.</i>

25:52.184 --> 25:54.794
<i>it's o.k., j.j.</i>

25:54.787 --> 25:57.617
<i>i'll see you</i>
<i>at home.</i>

25:57.822 --> 25:59.692
<i>don't you worry,</i>
<i>little man.</i>

25:59.692 --> 26:02.032
<i>i got you covered.</i>

26:29.187 --> 26:31.987
you need to act soon.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.291
you must prepare

26:33.292 --> 26:35.332
before
it's too late.

26:35.328 --> 26:37.758
i don't know what
you're talking about.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.163
your mother's death was no accident, jon.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.626
i can't help you
with this.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.695
i don't need
your help.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.804
you need mine.

26:45.805 --> 26:49.105
you came to me 30 years ago for help.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.848
that's all
behind me now.

26:55.848 --> 26:58.378
it's not behind you
at all.

26:58.384 --> 27:03.224
i can help you
stop him, jon.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.926
stay away from me.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.326
hi.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.289
hi.

27:44.296 --> 27:46.356
i have your watch.
it's upstairs.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.165
oh, hey,
don't worry about it.

27:48.167 --> 27:51.837
i hope i didn't offend
your friends last night.

27:51.837 --> 27:53.297
no.

27:53.305 --> 27:56.005
i--i brought these
anyway.

27:56.274 --> 27:59.244
that's so nice
of you.

27:59.711 --> 28:03.151
oh! come in.
come in.

28:06.117 --> 28:09.787
um, i was just
about to make dinner.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.819
mmm.

28:16.328 --> 28:19.328
looks like he had
the same idea.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.001
no! no!

28:21.000 --> 28:23.130
this is my
grandmother's pig.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.895
he must be
very dirty.

28:24.904 --> 28:29.274
actually, they're
very clean animals...

28:30.875 --> 28:33.935
cleaner than
a lot of people.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.176
dad, this is tony.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.021
hi, dad.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.991
he was just coming by
to say hi,

28:44.990 --> 28:48.430
and he brought us
these flowers.

28:54.132 --> 28:57.902
anything else
we can do for you?

29:03.374 --> 29:05.414
no.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.784
i'll just see myself
to the door.

29:08.781 --> 29:10.781
o.k.

29:11.883 --> 29:14.353
you know, you really
should be careful

29:14.353 --> 29:16.523
with that thing.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.016
you could hurt someone.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.885
i'll catch you later.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.755
o.k.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.073
what was that
all about?

29:36.075 --> 29:37.405
i don't like him.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.179
i noticed.
what's the deal?

29:39.178 --> 29:41.548
i just don't
like him!

29:43.248 --> 29:45.418
i don't know.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.347
he reminds me of someone i used to know.

29:48.354 --> 29:51.264
o.k., but he has been
very sweet to me.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.557
he tried to give me
a birthday present,

29:53.559 --> 29:56.259
and he brought us
these flowers.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.932
yeah, i guess
you're right.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.400
he must be
a real creep.

31:57.515 --> 32:01.175
picking up the mail?

32:02.154 --> 32:09.394
i used to sometimes do the
picking up the mail for mrs. porter.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.425
really?

32:10.429 --> 32:14.429
i'm sure that she really appreciated that.

32:14.433 --> 32:17.073
yeah,
but i didn't look at it

32:17.069 --> 32:18.569
because it's not
my affairs.

32:18.570 --> 32:21.100
right. i guess
you're right.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.106
people's mail
is their business.

32:23.108 --> 32:26.238
i don't look
at other people's affairs

32:26.245 --> 32:28.075
because it's not
my business.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.980
well, like
it's not my business

32:30.983 --> 32:35.653
to tell you
who to like and stuff.

32:36.287 --> 32:39.187
right.

32:39.390 --> 32:42.430
well, i'm going to
go inside now

32:42.428 --> 32:44.588
and take care
of my business.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.256
o.k.,
but if you ever...

32:46.265 --> 32:51.265
want to know what i think
about that, uh...

32:51.270 --> 32:52.500
bad guy...

32:52.504 --> 32:54.074
with the fast car,

32:54.073 --> 32:57.313
you just ask me, o.k.?

32:57.309 --> 32:59.179
i will.

32:59.178 --> 33:02.008
o.k., because
he's not like...

33:02.014 --> 33:04.654
he's not like
regular people.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.980
he's different.

33:05.985 --> 33:09.115
i saw him walking
the other night,

33:09.121 --> 33:12.521
and then i saw him
walking away.

33:12.524 --> 33:14.524
oh, no. i mean...

33:14.526 --> 33:16.456
i saw him walking,

33:16.462 --> 33:18.732
and then...

33:19.430 --> 33:22.330
and then
he was gone.

33:24.769 --> 33:26.399
uh, right.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.535
yeah.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.539
well, it was
really nice

33:29.541 --> 33:31.381
talking to you,
steve.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.477
thank you.

33:34.213 --> 33:36.613
â™ş here he comes,
here comes speed racer â™ş

33:36.615 --> 33:39.545
â™ş burnin' up
the quarter of a mile â™ş

33:42.521 --> 33:46.691
â™ş and he's gonna be chasin' after someone... â™ş

33:46.692 --> 33:47.492
aah!

33:47.493 --> 33:49.733
â™ş ...look alive

35:02.800 --> 35:06.700
<i>drink it,</i>
<i>and we all live forever.</i>

35:10.808 --> 35:13.278
<i>you freak!</i>

35:13.278 --> 35:15.478
<i>i'm going to</i>
<i>rip out your heart</i>

35:15.481 --> 35:18.381
<i>and eat it</i>
<i>while it beats.</i>

35:18.383 --> 35:19.683
<i>no!</i>

35:19.685 --> 35:21.685
<i>ugh!</i>

35:43.407 --> 35:45.707
<i>let's get out of here.</i>

35:50.148 --> 35:52.148
<i>hey, watch out!</i>

35:52.151 --> 35:53.821
<i>oh, my god.</i>

35:53.819 --> 35:56.849
<i>aah!</i>
<i>aah! aah!</i>

36:28.352 --> 36:29.692
hey,
what's your problem?

36:29.688 --> 36:31.688
you better wake
on up, buddy!

36:31.690 --> 36:33.960
come on.
let's get out of here.

36:33.959 --> 36:38.299
i got to get back to work
in 40 minutes.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.534
<i>archer continues to pester me</i>

37:15.534 --> 37:16.934
<i>about her death--</i>

37:16.935 --> 37:21.765
<i>i can't understand</i>
<i>that crazy old man.</i>

37:21.773 --> 37:24.943
<i>he asks me</i>
<i>about an old watch</i>

37:24.943 --> 37:26.783
<i>lisa was wearing</i>
<i>when she died.</i>

37:26.778 --> 37:29.508
<i>i can't remember there being</i>
<i>any old watch</i>

37:29.514 --> 37:33.254
<i>when they found</i>
<i>the body.</i>

37:35.987 --> 37:37.887
good morning.

37:37.889 --> 37:41.359
this is going to
take a lot longer

37:41.360 --> 37:45.700
we haven't even been through half of these rooms yet.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.527
let me give you
a hand.

37:47.532 --> 37:48.702
i'm happy to do it.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.900
i just don't really
want to spend

37:50.902 --> 37:56.442
where's that watch you were wearing the other night?

37:56.441 --> 37:58.581
that necklace?

37:58.577 --> 37:59.937
um...

37:59.945 --> 38:01.745
it's...

38:01.747 --> 38:02.977
ha!

38:02.981 --> 38:05.521
i can't remember.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.390
oh, great.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.888
think we can fix it?

38:15.894 --> 38:18.034
sure. hold this.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.700
grr...

38:19.698 --> 38:21.028
oh, come on.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.073
here. you just--

38:23.068 --> 38:25.298
aah! aah!

38:28.806 --> 38:31.976
maybe we should hire
an electrician.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.577
there must be
some tools

38:33.578 --> 38:35.908
around here
somewhere.

38:59.537 --> 39:01.667
here it is!

39:06.077 --> 39:07.707
aah!

39:07.713 --> 39:10.513
aah! ugh!

39:10.915 --> 39:14.515
oh, mr. porter,
you should use protection.

39:14.519 --> 39:15.589
i'll be careful.

39:15.587 --> 39:18.017
no, no. no.
you should use protection.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.763
here. these are
protection gloves.

39:20.759 --> 39:26.759
see, electricity--
electricity can kill you.

39:26.765 --> 39:30.595
they can protect you
from the electricity--

39:30.602 --> 39:32.672
even up to
a million volts.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.441
that's a lot
of electricity.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.610
mm-hmm.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.138
yeah.
thanks, steve.

39:38.143 --> 39:39.443
you're welcome.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.954
oh, no, mr. porter.
you keep them.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.907
you keep them
for a while

39:43.915 --> 39:46.415
because you may need
to use them again.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.518
well... thank you
very much.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.690
you're welcome.

41:13.871 --> 41:17.171
hello, jon.

41:18.008 --> 41:20.078
hello, father.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.245
change your mind?

41:26.251 --> 41:29.691
you were calling my mother before she died.

41:29.688 --> 41:30.918
she wouldn't listen
to me.

41:30.922 --> 41:34.092
what do you know
about her death?

41:35.659 --> 41:38.089
the sabbath approaches.

41:45.536 --> 41:49.266
this is the only way
to keep them away.

41:49.274 --> 41:52.184
father. no!

41:52.177 --> 41:54.037
stand back!

41:54.045 --> 41:56.145
oh, the spirit
indeed is willing,

41:56.147 --> 41:58.517
but the flesh
is weak...

41:58.517 --> 42:01.217
and so my blood

42:01.219 --> 42:05.119
is growing weak,
and they know that.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.523
who knows that?

42:06.525 --> 42:09.655
do you believe
in human evil, jon?

42:09.661 --> 42:13.961
i believe people
sometimes lose their way.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.065
what a very
thoughtful answer.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.567
you must feel
so very safe

42:18.570 --> 42:22.170
all that psychoanalytical blatherskite.

42:22.173 --> 42:23.913
hear no evil,

42:23.909 --> 42:25.309
speak no evil,
see no evil.

42:25.310 --> 42:29.980
is that how they teach psychology today?

42:31.749 --> 42:34.679
now, see this.

42:45.162 --> 42:47.202
<i>"dominatus..."</i>

42:51.169 --> 42:56.709
had not salomon dominion over demons?

42:56.941 --> 42:58.941
no doubt he tried.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.684
the rewards are...

43:01.680 --> 43:04.980
impossibly
tempting.

43:09.820 --> 43:11.220
30 years ago,

43:11.222 --> 43:15.592
you interrupted a cabalistic sabbath.

43:17.294 --> 43:19.734
your sister
wasn't just murdered.

43:19.731 --> 43:23.971
she was sacrificed
as part of a demonic ritual.

43:23.969 --> 43:27.369
the real ones
are very rare.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.842
they're very hard
to track.

43:29.841 --> 43:33.311
exactly when
the cabalistic sabbath occurs,

43:33.311 --> 43:36.181
which makes
the task at hand...

43:36.181 --> 43:38.981
very difficult.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.087
yes, i can see that.

43:42.087 --> 43:45.657
you already suspect that what i'm saying is true.

43:45.657 --> 43:47.917
you wouldn't be here
if you didn't.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.356
let me make
something

43:49.361 --> 43:51.391
very clear
to you, jon.

43:51.396 --> 43:53.796
you can't run away
from this.

43:53.798 --> 43:58.168
this evil will follow you
wherever you go.

43:59.036 --> 44:00.896
it already has.

44:00.905 --> 44:02.905
if you want
to stop it,

44:02.907 --> 44:05.407
you must cut it off
at the source,

44:05.410 --> 44:10.250
go back to where
it all started.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.020
but he died.

44:14.019 --> 44:16.149
they all died!

44:16.754 --> 44:20.124
i saw it
with my own eyes.

44:20.125 --> 44:26.955
a poorly extinguished fire
is quickly reignited.

44:28.298 --> 44:32.698
you must have somehow
<i>allowed</i> them to die.

44:32.704 --> 44:34.274
unless they die
by your hand,

44:34.272 --> 44:38.682
and take you and everyone
close to you with them.

44:38.677 --> 44:41.437
he's come back to finish
what you interrupted, jon,

44:41.446 --> 44:42.806
and each time
he kills,

44:42.814 --> 44:45.754
he can bring back
another of his minions

44:45.750 --> 44:49.050
you're saying i have to commit murder.

44:49.054 --> 44:52.994
you won't be
committing murder, jon.

44:53.724 --> 44:56.034
they're already dead.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.457
that book
will show you

44:57.462 --> 45:00.762
some of what
you need to know.

45:00.765 --> 45:02.965
take it with you.

45:08.205 --> 45:11.105
the beast will work
through the bloodline

45:11.109 --> 45:14.909
and sacrifice on the sabbath of the 18th year.

45:14.913 --> 45:17.783
he killed lisa
when she was 18, jon,

45:17.782 --> 45:19.082
and he killed
your mother

45:19.084 --> 45:21.224
so you'd bring michelle
to him.

45:21.219 --> 45:27.189
if you think my mother was killed,
tell me who did it.

45:27.424 --> 45:29.334
a man named jim norman

45:29.327 --> 45:32.357
was the last man
i heard of

45:32.363 --> 45:34.503
to violate
the sabbath.

45:34.499 --> 45:36.369
if you don't believe me,

45:36.367 --> 45:39.967
you may want
to call on him...

45:40.938 --> 45:42.768
unless
you'd rather wait

45:42.774 --> 45:47.414
for tony to come
knocking on your door.

46:08.065 --> 46:10.465
â™ş so you better
look alive â™ş

46:10.468 --> 46:14.398
â™ş he's busy revving up
the powerful mach five â™ş

46:14.405 --> 46:15.535
â™ş here he comes

46:15.540 --> 46:17.240
â™ş here comes
speed racer â™ş

46:17.242 --> 46:19.442
â™ş he's a demon
on wheels â™ş

46:19.444 --> 46:21.044
yep, definitely
looks like

46:21.045 --> 46:23.945
it's hyper-hydraulic
mulch-mode time.

46:23.948 --> 46:26.278
o.k., let's do it.

46:27.184 --> 46:30.394
â™ş here he comes,
here comes speed racer â™ş

46:30.388 --> 46:33.488
â™ş and when the odds
are against you â™ş

46:33.491 --> 46:37.331
â™ş and there's
dangerous work to do â™ş

46:37.328 --> 46:40.058
â™ş you bet your life
speed racer â™ş

46:40.064 --> 46:43.934
â™ş will be there
to see it through â™ş

46:45.203 --> 46:46.403
uh-oh.

46:46.404 --> 46:51.414
what's wrong
with the powerful mach five?

46:52.376 --> 46:54.276
oh.

46:54.279 --> 46:57.009
looky here.

46:58.882 --> 47:00.482
a red shoe.

47:00.485 --> 47:04.415
where did this
come from?

47:09.026 --> 47:10.356
ugh!

47:10.361 --> 47:12.061
i got you.

47:12.063 --> 47:15.433
you can't run away
like that.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.970
now, you stay on

47:17.969 --> 47:23.039
because i can't do anything
without my hat.

47:32.349 --> 47:34.149
oh, no!

47:34.152 --> 47:37.052
well, what do we
have here?

47:40.357 --> 47:42.527
somebody
come help me...

47:42.527 --> 47:44.557
hi, steve.
i've been thinking.

47:44.562 --> 47:47.062
we never really
had a chance

47:47.065 --> 47:49.165
to get to know
each other.

47:49.167 --> 47:51.897
you know, i'm not
such a <i>bad</i> guy

47:51.903 --> 47:54.073
once you get
to know me.

47:55.640 --> 47:57.040
no...

47:57.041 --> 47:58.241
here's a question.

47:58.243 --> 48:00.313
if a gardener
with a big mouth

48:00.311 --> 48:02.381
is alone in a field
being tortured

48:02.380 --> 48:05.010
and no one's there
to hear him scream,

48:05.016 --> 48:07.176
does it still hurt?

48:10.153 --> 48:12.893
no! no!

48:13.390 --> 48:16.160
no!

48:16.160 --> 48:18.900
no!

48:18.897 --> 48:20.197
no!

48:20.198 --> 48:24.168
aah! urgh!

48:26.236 --> 48:31.166
looks to me
like a bad hair day.

48:38.181 --> 48:41.451
mind giving me a hand?

51:11.301 --> 51:13.101
welcome back.

51:13.104 --> 51:16.214
when do we eat?

51:16.540 --> 51:20.340
you do only what
i tell you to do.

51:20.344 --> 51:25.084
i've waited too long
to get this right.

51:25.415 --> 51:29.085
i know we understand
each other.

51:39.229 --> 51:41.629
here. put these on.

51:41.632 --> 51:43.472
in fullbrook,
do you have

51:43.468 --> 51:45.198
a listing
for a jim norman?

51:45.203 --> 51:46.803
no, sir, i don't.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.274
how about james?

51:48.272 --> 51:49.542
i have "j" period.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.140
yes, yes,
of course

51:51.142 --> 51:53.112
i would be
interested

51:53.111 --> 51:54.111
in a "j" period.

51:54.112 --> 51:56.552
there's no need
to get testy, sir.

51:56.547 --> 51:58.147
it's 555-7309.

51:58.149 --> 51:59.549
09. thank you.

51:59.550 --> 52:01.220
you're welcome.

52:10.561 --> 52:11.791
hello.

52:11.796 --> 52:13.696
hello. my name
is jon porter.

52:13.698 --> 52:16.628
may i please speak
with jim norman?

52:16.634 --> 52:18.174
who is this?

52:18.169 --> 52:19.269
uh, jon porter.

52:19.270 --> 52:21.370
i hope i'm calling
the right number.

52:21.372 --> 52:25.142
did jim live in glenrock
for some time?

52:25.143 --> 52:28.643
great. i do have
the right number then.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.146
is he home?

52:30.148 --> 52:31.448
my husband is dead.

52:31.449 --> 52:34.219
he died
this morning.

52:34.918 --> 52:37.218
i--i see.

52:38.722 --> 52:41.492
i'm so sorry.

52:41.858 --> 52:44.458
look, look, look,
i--i'm try--

52:44.462 --> 52:46.302
please forgive me
for asking.

52:46.297 --> 52:48.757
i know it's none
of my business,

52:48.766 --> 52:50.526
but had he been ill?

52:50.535 --> 52:53.435
he bled to death.
it was horrible.

52:53.437 --> 52:56.607
i've never seen a body
mangled like that.

52:56.607 --> 52:58.337
there was just
so much blood,

52:58.342 --> 53:00.442
and i really
must say, jon,

53:00.444 --> 53:04.414
it was some
of my very best work.

53:04.415 --> 53:08.545
he's bleeding like
a stuck pig in summertime.

53:08.553 --> 53:13.223
there's no stopping this heavy flow.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.222
hello. <i>gazette.</i>

53:43.221 --> 53:46.821
yes. i'm trying
to get ahold of some--

53:46.824 --> 53:48.624
of some, uh,
back issues.

53:48.626 --> 53:51.256
do you have an archives
of some sort?

53:51.262 --> 53:54.302
well, how far back
you looking to go?

53:54.298 --> 53:56.368
uh...

53:56.833 --> 53:59.373
about 30 years.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.560
you know, jon...

54:28.566 --> 54:30.496
it wasn't
very nice of you

54:30.501 --> 54:31.631
to threaten
my pal tony

54:31.636 --> 54:34.836
with that great big
fire-poker of yours.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.811
that's o.k.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.910
i know
you didn't mean it,

54:41.912 --> 54:43.312
but tell me something.

54:43.314 --> 54:45.054
have you seen
that poker lately?

54:45.049 --> 54:48.319
i think i stuck it
to michelle.

55:09.339 --> 55:11.039
keep them closed.

55:11.042 --> 55:12.842
now...

55:12.843 --> 55:14.043
open them.

55:14.045 --> 55:15.535
happy birthday!

55:15.546 --> 55:16.776
is this for me?

55:16.781 --> 55:19.011
it is your birthday,
isn't it?

55:19.016 --> 55:20.646
thanks.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.321
o.k., um...

55:26.790 --> 55:29.020
yay!

55:29.026 --> 55:31.086
o.k. now i'm
going to do

55:31.095 --> 55:33.625
your birthday
tarot.

55:34.798 --> 55:37.768
cut the deck into three piles to the left.

55:37.768 --> 55:40.568
maybe it will
tell us something

55:40.571 --> 55:43.711
about mr. sex hunk
from the diner.

55:43.708 --> 55:45.968
this card is your
significator card.

55:45.976 --> 55:47.676
basically,
it represents you.

55:47.678 --> 55:52.608
these cards are the past,
the present...

55:52.616 --> 55:54.646
the future.

55:54.652 --> 55:58.352
this card represents
views of others,

55:58.356 --> 56:01.756
and the last card
is the outcome.

56:01.759 --> 56:03.589
o.k.

56:03.594 --> 56:06.904
go on. turn it.

56:09.799 --> 56:11.399
interesting.

56:11.402 --> 56:15.942
the lovers. how come
i never get that one?

56:15.940 --> 56:18.740
come on.
it's just tarot cards.

56:18.743 --> 56:22.083
taro.
taro cards.

56:22.079 --> 56:24.079
whatever.

56:28.418 --> 56:31.448
hi, dad.

56:35.158 --> 56:36.558
what's going on here?

56:36.560 --> 56:41.860
they're having a birthday party for me.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.572
who lit the fire?

56:50.473 --> 56:52.943
"a poorly
extinguished fire

56:52.943 --> 56:56.083
is quickly
reignited."

56:57.781 --> 56:59.081
where the hell's
the poker?

56:59.083 --> 57:04.423
i don't know.
what's the matter with you?

57:07.056 --> 57:11.626
nothing like a big, strong man
to stir up a fire.

57:11.629 --> 57:12.729
would you stop it?

57:12.730 --> 57:16.930
he'd old enough
to be your father.

57:20.603 --> 57:23.713
great earrings.

57:24.507 --> 57:26.177
oh, thanks.

57:26.177 --> 57:28.137
where'd
you get them?

57:28.145 --> 57:32.575
from someone
older than your father.

57:32.916 --> 57:36.646
so, anyone need anything
from the kitchen?

57:36.654 --> 57:38.054
yeah.

57:38.055 --> 57:39.755
no.

57:52.135 --> 57:54.195
aah!

58:24.167 --> 58:27.597
doesn't seem to be any evidence in the house.

58:27.605 --> 58:30.135
really? what do you
call this mess

58:30.140 --> 58:32.240
i just put in the ground?

58:32.243 --> 58:34.213
well, sir,
i'd call that buried.

58:34.211 --> 58:37.251
excuse me, but that was
my grandmother's pet,

58:37.248 --> 58:40.118
and somebody killed it
with a fire-poker,

58:40.117 --> 58:44.117
so if you could find them,
we'd all feel safer.

58:44.121 --> 58:47.161
here's your evidence.

58:48.058 --> 58:51.158
i'm not sure what purpose
it'll serve

58:51.161 --> 58:52.691
covered with
your fingerprints.

58:52.696 --> 58:54.196
this house was
deliberately vandalized.

58:54.198 --> 58:57.168
they left some mark
in the kitchen.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.167
which i noticed
you cleaned up.

58:59.169 --> 59:01.199
i want to know
who did this!

59:01.205 --> 59:03.935
i also want a complete
investigation into this

59:03.941 --> 59:08.641
and any connection it might have
to my mother's death.

59:10.079 --> 59:11.909
do i make myself clear?

59:11.916 --> 59:16.786
are you suggesting that mrs. porter was murdered, sir?

59:18.121 --> 59:21.861
i'm suggesting
you look into it.

59:37.607 --> 59:39.577
<i>commingle the blood</i>

59:39.577 --> 59:43.277
<i>and sacrifice the girl</i>
<i>in her 18th year.</i>

59:43.280 --> 59:47.050
<i>let life leave her body</i>
<i>at midnight</i>

59:47.051 --> 59:48.951
<i>and eat her</i>
<i>still-beating heart,</i>

59:48.953 --> 59:53.163
<i>thus assuming</i>
<i>the power of the beast.</i>

01:00:18.382 --> 01:00:23.352
<i>he's come back to
finish what you interrupted, jon.</i>

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:27.664
<i>he can bring back</i>
<i>another of his minions</i>

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.358
<i>unless you stop him.</i>

01:00:37.066 --> 01:00:38.966
<i>the false prophet</i>

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.799
<i>may sever a digit</i>

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:44.344
<i>to keep the latch closed...</i>

01:00:46.043 --> 01:00:49.883
<i>and spilling blood</i>
<i>on the circle,</i>

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:54.080
<i>desecrating the beast</i>
<i>and sending it back</i>

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:57.154
<i>from whence it came.</i>

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:10.303
look,
weird stuff happens around here,

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.870
like, every day.

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:14.399
one time, we drove
up to the top

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:16.295
of snyder hill
late at night.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:18.906
it's totally creepy
up there

01:01:18.909 --> 01:01:21.209
with that old
train tunnel.

01:01:21.211 --> 01:01:22.741
art...

01:01:22.746 --> 01:01:23.776
streiber.

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:27.781
he had his dad's
brand-new camaro.

01:01:27.785 --> 01:01:29.175
leather interior.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.746
the most exciting part wasn't the sex.

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:34.815
it was doing it in front of that tunnel.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:39.025
i felt like...
someone was watching us,

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:44.199
like... someone
i couldn't see.

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:49.236
speak of the devil.

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.246
he's so cute!

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:02.848
i told you he was going to come tonight.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:04.093
go over there.

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:05.318
are you crazy?

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:09.292
do you want me
to show you how?

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:11.493
watch and learn.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:25.111
that's a great jacket.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:27.009
thanks.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:29.280
can i try it on?

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:34.518
sure.

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:57.508
i bet you have
a great car

01:02:57.508 --> 01:03:00.108
to go with this
jacket, huh?

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:03.880
yes, i do.

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.521
and i was wondering
if michelle

01:03:10.521 --> 01:03:14.021
would like
to go for a ride.

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:22.897
ugh.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:51.331
feeling better, jules?

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:54.361
don't fuck with me.

01:04:05.508 --> 01:04:07.138
where's michelle?

01:04:07.144 --> 01:04:11.454
michelle left
with tony.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.248
no. she can't! no.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:18.491
well, she already did.

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:22.960
i understand, sir,
how traumatic

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.260
this time must be
for you.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:27.232
it must seem easier
to blame someone

01:04:27.231 --> 01:04:30.401
instead of accepting the circumstances of the accident.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:34.000
what the hell are you guys doing over there?

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:35.404
have you found
anything?

01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:38.235
why, yes. the blood
doesn't check out.

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:41.142
what do you mean
it doesn't check out?

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:43.184
there was blood
all over the kitchen.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:46.480
i realize that,
but according to our tests,

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.983
it wasn't pig blood.

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.322
it was human blood.

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.486
human.

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:59.362
it's your mother's
blood, sir.

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.260
that can't be.

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:04.896
it could be left
from the accident.

01:05:04.902 --> 01:05:07.372
no.

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:09.971
it was fresh.

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:10.913
i saw it.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.108
did your mother
mention anyone

01:05:13.110 --> 01:05:14.610
bothering her
before she died,

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:17.181
anyone who didn't
like her?

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.380
no.

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.651
well,
you let me know

01:05:23.654 --> 01:05:26.194
if you think
of anything.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.689
oh...

01:05:27.691 --> 01:05:32.261
you're not planning on leaving town right away,
are you, sir?

01:05:32.262 --> 01:05:35.632
no. i'll be here.

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:38.402
thanks for the coffee.

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:41.122
facing your deepest
fears, jon?

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:47.762
want to know
what happens

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:49.664
to little boys
who poke their noses

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:51.666
where they
don't belong?

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.568
want to know
what happens

01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:55.100
when they see things

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.805
they're not supposed
to see?

01:07:56.807 --> 01:07:58.767
you killed my sister.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:07:59.765
yes!

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.336
and i could kill you
right now,

01:08:02.345 --> 01:08:04.845
but that would be
too soon.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:08.348
and i want you
to see it this time

01:08:08.351 --> 01:08:09.351
when we do michelle.

01:08:09.352 --> 01:08:11.152
i won't
let that happen.

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:15.524
what are you,
some kind of tough guy now?

01:08:15.525 --> 01:08:18.385
how terrifying.

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:21.432
but you weren't
so tough

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:25.501
when we took care of your sister, now,
were you, j.j.?

01:08:25.502 --> 01:08:28.671
oh, but you <i>did</i> interfere.

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:33.412
that's why i've been taking
such good care of your family

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.510
over the years.

01:08:39.348 --> 01:08:41.247
let's see.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:43.520
first there was your wife.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.520
car wreck, wasn't it?

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.892
tell me,
have you ever seen a body

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:50.591
divided so neatly
in half before?

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:52.134
and then dad.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:54.459
oh, dear old dad.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.663
heart attack, right?

01:08:55.665 --> 01:08:57.425
funny how that happens

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:01.374
when you see something
really scary.

01:09:01.371 --> 01:09:04.511
mom. well...

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:07.238
mom was the easiest
one of all.

01:09:07.243 --> 01:09:09.484
just set the old bitch up

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:12.479
and knock her down.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.322
wham bam!

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.417
see you later, mom.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:24.358
i brought you here,
fucker.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:27.761
payback is a bitch.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:55.587
it's just i've never seen
that much blood.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:59.759
oh, my god.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:03.203
maybe it was just
some kind of accident.

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:05.600
what's going on?

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.372
i'm sorry.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:08.840
i didn't know
who to tell.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:11.908
my parents are out of town.
jules isn't home.

01:10:11.908 --> 01:10:14.378
i was going to
call the police--

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.877
maria,
what happened?

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.609
we don't know
where steve is.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:20.415
i went by the school

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:22.317
and saw steve's
lawn mower

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:23.819
with blood on it.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:26.590
then i found this.

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:34.599
and i found these
all around it.

01:10:35.764 --> 01:10:39.734
i found teeth like this
in tony's jacket pocket

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:42.536
that night
at the diner.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:58.617
come on, jules.
where are you?

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:48.374
sucking solo tonight?

01:11:48.371 --> 01:11:49.501
excuse me?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:51.706
do you mind
if i sit down?

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:56.408
um, actually,
i'm waiting for some...

01:11:56.413 --> 01:11:58.613
friends.

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:03.082
there's no smoking
in here.

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:11.558
listen...

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:13.931
why don't we just
get this over with?

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:17.670
i'm sure there's a cheap motel around here somewhere.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:19.567
you're disgusting.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:20.769
oh, that's true,

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.500
but no one does
the tongue tango

01:12:23.506 --> 01:12:25.706
like i do, sweetheart.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.508
pardon me.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:30.040
is this guy
bothering you?

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.446
kind of.

01:12:31.448 --> 01:12:32.508
may i?

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.015
hey, pal,

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:37.087
how about taking a walk?

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.720
fuck you.

01:12:41.657 --> 01:12:43.517
wrong answer.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.486
o.k. o.k.

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.404
sorry about that.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.100
hello. i'm vinnie.

01:12:53.103 --> 01:12:54.773
i'm maria.

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:58.471
maria. that's
a beautiful name.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:00.905
thanks.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.840
you're welcome.

01:13:02.846 --> 01:13:05.876
do you want
to sit down?

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:07.882
actually, i was
thinking about leaving

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:11.794
in case romeo
comes back for seconds.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:41.017
you have
really cute ears.

01:13:41.017 --> 01:13:42.447
oh, yeah?

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.592
they're good
to nibble on.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.487
mmm.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:52.190
you know,
i have a surprise for you.

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:53.185
you do?

01:13:53.196 --> 01:13:57.166
mm-hmm.
close your eyes.

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:06.213
o.k.

01:14:07.876 --> 01:14:10.646
surprise!

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:18.791
mmm. i almost forgot.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.558
i have a surprise
for you, too.

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:23.158
oh, really?

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:24.559
yes.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:26.691
now close your eyes.

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.629
o.k.

01:14:33.569 --> 01:14:35.499
surprise!

01:14:35.505 --> 01:14:37.065
aah!

01:14:56.525 --> 01:15:00.725
i thought you might
need some coffee.

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.598
thanks.

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:08.842
did you sleep?

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:13.268
i could hear you
walking around.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:18.748
what's the rifle for?

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:24.687
you know,
you always made it o.k.

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:29.117
for us to be straight
with each other.

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:31.555
yeah.

01:15:31.561 --> 01:15:32.231
yeah, well,

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.128
i think
it's time for us

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:37.060
to be straight
with each other.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.040
hello?

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:55.254
i have a package
for jon porter.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.221
hello?

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:06.034
package for jon porter.
i need your signature.

01:16:06.029 --> 01:16:07.329
what is it?

01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:10.230
i need your signature,
please.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:13.973
set it on the porch.
who's it from?

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.667
from your childhood
friends, jonny!

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:20.044
ah ha ha ha ha!

01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:22.213
oh, that's no way to treat

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:25.111
good old friends, jon.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:27.724
you remember vinnie,
don't you?

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:31.585
and our good buddy sean.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:33.148
ha ha ha ha!

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.886
come near here again,
i'll kill you.

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:38.591
boys and girls,
we're having a little party tonight,

01:16:38.595 --> 01:16:41.295
and you're both invited.

01:16:42.130 --> 01:16:43.360
catch you later.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:57.748
oh! oh, my god!

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.847
what is going on?

01:16:59.849 --> 01:17:01.249
oh, michelle.

01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:05.190
michelle, i'll
tell you everything.

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.921
who are those guys?

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:09.224
well, they're not human.

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:14.325
they may have been
human once...

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:17.300
they're what's left
when the humanity

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.230
has been sucked
out of them

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:23.335
and the evil
becomes incarnate.

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:25.739
i won't let them
near michelle.

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:28.882
"better is the end
of a thing

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:34.378
let us hope that
<i>ecclesiastes</i> is true.

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:58.973
can i help you with something?

01:17:59.908 --> 01:18:01.408
no. i just wanted--

01:18:01.411 --> 01:18:02.711
we've been getting
complaints

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:04.252
about illicit activities around here.

01:18:04.247 --> 01:18:05.777
did you know that?

01:18:05.782 --> 01:18:07.312
no. i mean, yes.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:10.686
i came here because my friend is missing.

01:18:10.687 --> 01:18:12.717
her name
is maria moore.

01:18:12.722 --> 01:18:14.422
i was supposed
to meet her

01:18:14.424 --> 01:18:16.394
at the diner
last night.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:18.062
she wasn't there.
she didn't call.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:22.061
i can't find her,
and i don't know what to do.

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:27.895
come down to the station
and tell us about it.

01:18:27.904 --> 01:18:30.044
let's go.

01:18:37.779 --> 01:18:40.949
do you really think
we'll find her?

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:43.280
of course
we will, honey.

01:18:43.286 --> 01:18:45.486
let's go.

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.399
would you like
a doughnut?

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:01.374
sure.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:08.080
i'm sorry.
did i say doughnut?

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:12.207
they're tasty
and so good for you.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:14.775
ha ha ha ha!

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:17.424
aah!

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:22.164
i still don't understand why we can't leave.

01:19:22.158 --> 01:19:24.128
because they will
follow you!

01:19:24.127 --> 01:19:26.257
they already have
the taste for you.

01:19:26.262 --> 01:19:31.372
wait for the sabbath.
that is when you will strike.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.366
what do we have to do?

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:39.473
desecrate him as he has done unto you.

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:44.005
but first,
you must bring me something of his...

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:48.053
something
that he has touched...

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.945
which your sister
also touched

01:19:52.955 --> 01:19:56.085
and michelle
has touched as well,

01:19:56.092 --> 01:19:59.362
and you had better
do it soon.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:10.039
oh, allow me.

01:20:10.039 --> 01:20:12.209
woo!

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.523
no! no!

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:28.391
looks like another
little piggy

01:20:28.391 --> 01:20:29.421
tried to get to market.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:32.125
seems to me
this little piggy

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.328
should have stayed
home today.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.100
would you like to know

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:39.498
what my tarot cards
have to say?

01:20:50.111 --> 01:20:53.281
leave me alone!

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:58.050
aah!

01:21:11.499 --> 01:21:14.269
aah!

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:19.614
help me!

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:28.882
uh!

01:21:29.284 --> 01:21:34.224
shh!
it's quiet time now.

01:22:21.436 --> 01:22:23.336
where did you put it?

01:22:23.339 --> 01:22:25.509
i think
it's in my room!

01:22:25.508 --> 01:22:27.538
hurry!

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:32.445
within the magic circle,

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:37.248
the false prophet
must sever a digit.

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:45.191
what are you doing?
let's go.

01:22:45.194 --> 01:22:46.434
i can't find it!

01:22:46.429 --> 01:22:48.359
what did you do
with it?

01:22:48.364 --> 01:22:49.334
i don't know.

01:22:49.332 --> 01:22:51.232
where's
that goddamn thing?

01:22:51.233 --> 01:22:52.603
oh, i got it!

01:22:52.601 --> 01:22:54.441
let's go!

01:23:38.446 --> 01:23:41.416
i'll take you down
with me!

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.147
where are we
going, father?

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:45.292
yeah. where are you
taking us?

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:48.487
leave here!

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:10.412
but we just
got here.

01:24:15.150 --> 01:24:18.320
what's the matter,
father?

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:22.387
don't like
what you see?

01:24:42.278 --> 01:24:45.478
what? come on, come on!

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:48.551
i can't
go down there again.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:54.724
archer!

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:02.364
archer!

01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:16.412
archer!

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:30.423
michelle?

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:36.396
michelle?

01:25:40.869 --> 01:25:42.899
jules?

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:49.283
michelle,
where are you?

01:25:51.379 --> 01:25:53.409
jules?

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:58.392
where are you?
you have to help me.

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.517
jules?

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:08.828
no.

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:13.603
jules?

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.513
no, not jules.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:23.339
aah! aah!

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:26.275
disappointed?

01:26:41.529 --> 01:26:45.429
<i>desecrate him as he has done unto you.</i>

01:26:45.434 --> 01:26:49.504
<i>the false prophet</i>
<i>must sever a digit</i>

01:26:49.505 --> 01:26:50.765
<i>to keep</i>
<i>the latch closed.</i>

01:26:50.773 --> 01:26:52.413
<i>dad? this is tony.</i>

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:55.908
<i>i want you to see it this time,</i>

01:26:55.911 --> 01:27:00.911
<i>i'm sending it back from whence it came.</i>

01:27:01.916 --> 01:27:04.916
give me your hands.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:09.391
bleed for daddy.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:12.591
oh... oh...

01:27:12.595 --> 01:27:13.985
no!

01:27:15.431 --> 01:27:16.931
no!

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.342
bitch.

01:27:22.338 --> 01:27:25.508
don't you want to bleed
for daddy, too?

01:27:25.507 --> 01:27:28.477
get away from me!

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:54.702
no!

01:28:23.498 --> 01:28:25.928
yes!

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:16.747
guns are not allowed.

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.755
scared, jon?

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.737
hard admitting it to yourself,
isn't it?

01:29:35.738 --> 01:29:37.568
aah!

01:29:37.573 --> 01:29:38.443
no!

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.140
get away from her!

01:29:40.142 --> 01:29:41.682
shut up.

01:29:41.677 --> 01:29:42.937
chain him.

01:29:42.945 --> 01:29:47.445
aah! aah! aah! aah!

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:01.497
michelle!

01:30:36.998 --> 01:30:40.798
you're mine now, bitch.

01:30:44.505 --> 01:30:46.535
not this time.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.585
hey!

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:03.621
aah! aah! aah!

01:31:58.546 --> 01:32:04.616
die...
you miserable fuck!

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:15.834
catch you later.

01:32:29.277 --> 01:32:31.277
michelle!

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:53.296
oh!

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:03.141
<i>good-bye, j.j.</i>

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:09.177
what is it?

01:33:11.586 --> 01:33:13.646
nothing.

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:17.292
let's go.

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:32.037
well,
i'm not as afraid

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.310
of the dark
as i have been.

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:40.006
can you think of why that might be?

01:33:42.383 --> 01:33:44.323
not exactly.

01:33:44.819 --> 01:33:48.389
i--i guess it's about
realizing what it is

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:50.220
that i'm really
afraid of,

01:33:50.225 --> 01:33:53.325
like if i'm afraid
to talk to julia.

01:33:53.328 --> 01:33:55.328
what i'm really
afraid of

01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:57.300
is that
she'll laugh at me

01:33:57.299 --> 01:33:59.969
and make me feel
like a jerk.

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:01.638
can she do that?

01:34:01.637 --> 01:34:05.207
no. i do that
to myself, i guess.

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:08.313
good. good.

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:17.047
i've been thinking a lot about what you said.

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:22.318
sometimes the
hardest part is admitting to yourself

01:34:22.324 --> 01:34:24.124
that something exists

01:34:24.126 --> 01:34:26.656
which makes you
frightened.

01:34:26.827 --> 01:34:30.327
is everything o.k.?

01:34:37.271 --> 01:34:39.011
yeah.

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:44.012
everything is fine.
