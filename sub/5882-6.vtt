WEBVTT

01:28.797 --> 01:30.006
You're asking if l'νe seen these before?

01:31.550 --> 01:32.842
They've been running this for ten years.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.469
The Playtex people are jealous.

01:34.553 --> 01:35.720
They shouldn't be.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.139
Maidenform is a dream,
but Playtex is a bra.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.558
I've never seen either brand go wrong.

01:40.642 --> 01:41.934
I had four of these up in my dorm.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.020
I didn't eνen know what advertising was.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.397
Why now? Sales are strong.

01:46.482 --> 01:48.441
Someone has a wife with an opinion.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.526
They would like to do
what Maidenform is doing,

01:50.611 --> 01:52.445
not what we're doing.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.615
Why? Then they both
have the same campaign.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.200
I loνe how they don't need a diagram.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.868
Peggy, do you wear Playtex?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.536
And if so, why?

02:01.872 --> 02:03.498
I do,

02:03.582 --> 02:06.459
and I agree with
the 95 women we surveyed

02:06.543 --> 02:08.419
about how well it fits.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.671
I find they both open easily.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.965
I like a happy client,

02:13.050 --> 02:14.842
although you'd think
someone would be able

02:14.927 --> 02:16.219
to talk them out of jumping
onto a bandwagon

02:16.303 --> 02:18.930
- as solid as this.
- Maybe they want us to raise the bar.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.349
Why, because their share
of the market keeps increasing?

02:21.433 --> 02:22.642
You see them every four months.

02:22.726 --> 02:23.726
Why not throw them a bone?

02:23.811 --> 02:24.894
Let them see they're paying for creatiνe.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.063
Just wrinkle it a little.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.606
I went to sleep in my bra,

02:28.690 --> 02:30.483
and I thought l was so-and-so.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.152
Thank you for that.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.905
Just for fun, let's say
we're looking for new,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.574
and by new I mean old Maidenform.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.495
Peggy, you dig in around
Playtex's unique benefits.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.830
Just the man to do it.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.081
What do I tell them?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.083
Tell them you couldn't get a hold of me.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.006
Mr. Phillips, your ex--

02:54.091 --> 02:55.758
your wife--

02:55.843 --> 02:57.260
Mrs. Phillips--

02:57.344 --> 02:59.345
Pauline. I see her.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.097
Thank you, Joyce.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.018
Hey, fella.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.938
Hey, Chauncey. Come here.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.567
Someone made you
smell like a girl, yes.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.111
Come on. This way.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.364
Hey, slugger.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.699
Hey, Dad.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.117
- Precious.
- Hi, Daddy.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.580
- You look well.
- So do you.

03:26.707 --> 03:27.915
How's your mother?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.501
Worse. She's νery erratic.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.754
Did you see the guy up at Brigham

03:33.839 --> 03:35.047
that Bob Levinson recommended?

03:35.132 --> 03:37.133
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.052
I can't leave right now.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.304
I wish you would have told me

03:41.388 --> 03:42.722
that you were going to be early.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.557
Well, I know you're not
good in the afternoons.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.934
That's not true anymore.
You know that.

03:47.978 --> 03:49.103
Okay.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.230
You two have a good time.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.982
I will try and call you from Nana's.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.358
Did you get a suite?

03:54.443 --> 03:56.485
They opened up the room next door.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.195
I even got a rollaway for Chauncey.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.157
'Cause he's a good boy. Yeah.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.326
We're going to haνe
a wonderful time on the town.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.745
I got tickets
for A Funny Thing Happened.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.079
We saw it.

04:07.164 --> 04:08.706
Not from these seats.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.291
I should go.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.090
So, you'll have to wait
a little while in my office,

04:18.175 --> 04:20.092
do your studies, work up an appetite.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.093
It's Memorial Day.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.762
All I have is German vocabulary.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.764
Hey, Duck. Sorry to bother you.

04:24.848 --> 04:27.099
Nice dog.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.309
Who are these?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.811
This is my son Mark
and my daughter Patricia.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.104
A handsome family.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.106
And this is Chauncey.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.734
I hope he can't smell cat on me.

04:36.818 --> 04:38.527
Freddie and I work together.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.112
Can I bend your ear a minute?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.614
Spit it out, Freddie.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.993
We're going to need
another box of brassieres.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.413
Yes. Of course.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.041
Enjoy your holiday.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.752
Come on, Chauncey.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.551
Her skin cleared up,
but she still looks unhappy.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.803
She's a cheerleader.

05:03.887 --> 05:05.930
For who, the University of Dour?

05:08.183 --> 05:09.183
Does she have any cute friends?

05:09.309 --> 05:11.602
These are the top three.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.522
I'm sorry, but compared to the kids
on American Bandstand,

05:14.606 --> 05:15.815
they look miserable.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.108
Those kids are drunk.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.109
Really?

05:18.193 --> 05:19.276
I don't know.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.321
What about the idea of them
going on a date?

05:23.949 --> 05:26.158
Mr. and Mrs. Fresh Face.

05:26.243 --> 05:28.035
We could do multiple panels in print,

05:28.120 --> 05:30.121
but it would really translate to TV.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.163
How?

05:31.248 --> 05:32.540
Like a contest?

05:32.624 --> 05:34.792
No, it's a story.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.003
Anticipation as they get ready,

05:37.087 --> 05:39.880
fixing their hair to look perfect.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.174
Their skin, it's not even on their mind.

05:42.259 --> 05:44.885
They're two kids
who used to haνe a problem.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.263
Thanks, Clearasil.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.266
Maybe, but it's prom night,

05:50.350 --> 05:55.229
and it ends with him at the door
and her and a corsage,

05:55.355 --> 05:57.523
the first moment
they see each other.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.649
And Dad with the Brownie?

05:58.734 --> 06:00.818
Clearasil...

06:00.902 --> 06:02.903
and some kind of line.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.323
What about "Thanks, Clearasil"?

06:06.408 --> 06:08.617
I need to think about it.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.494
I can work with that.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.580
You want to run this
by your father-in-law?

06:12.664 --> 06:14.415
Eventually.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.295
Have a nice holiday.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.935
So how the hell are you, Don?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.103
Good. How are you, Crab?

06:36.188 --> 06:37.646
Glad to be in shorts.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.898
You don't play?

06:38.982 --> 06:40.524
I don't mind watching.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.984
Whenever it's this hot,

06:42.069 --> 06:44.570
l think about that summer
they executed the Rosenbergs.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.905
It was always about to rain.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.239
I remember that.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.908
We were still in Manhattan.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.242
- I don't miss it.
- Yep.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.912
We get them to close Sing Sing,
we'll be in Shangri-la.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.455
I keep having this dream

06:54.539 --> 06:56.290
that there's a power failure
and the gates open.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.126
Hadn't thought of that.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.586
Let's change the subject.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.255
Eventually, I just said, "Fine.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.801
"lf Lem Jones Associates is falling apart,
maybe it's time to move on."

07:06.885 --> 07:08.803
I hadn't heard about that.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.222
I guess you PR men haνe the best PR.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.225
Yeah, I went to Rogers & Cowan
and left it burning behind me.

07:14.309 --> 07:15.518
What happened over there?

07:21.566 --> 07:26.612
I was on the team that took the fall
for the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.280
The Bay of Pigs?

07:28.365 --> 07:31.075
The CIA hired us
to help inspire the Cuban people

07:31.159 --> 07:34.286
to a coordinated wave
of sabotage and rebellion.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.538
You handled that?

07:35.622 --> 07:38.833
Not as badly as they did.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.293
But I don't know when Don's going
to be able to get away.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.170
High-class problems, my dear.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.632
Marcie, we should say
hello to Chuck and Ann.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.229
I didn't know you belonged here.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.107
I've been coming here
since l was a kid.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.817
We're guests of the Pattersons.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.029
Where's Tara?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.741
Over there, l think.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.326
I haven't seen you riding.

08:14.411 --> 08:16.745
I suppose that's true.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.206
I know you changed your schedule,

08:19.291 --> 08:21.834
and I'm afraid l had
something to do with that.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.044
No. Don't be ridiculous.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.800
All I wanted to say is
please ride when you want.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.343
I'll stay out of your way.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.388
It's very nice to see you.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.099
Arthur, it's okay.

08:37.184 --> 08:41.270
As we used to say in college,
let's be friends.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.356
Good. Because I think
you would have enjoyed

08:44.441 --> 08:46.358
seeing me get nosed
into the trough the other day.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.693
No.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.069
Yes.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.740
Mommy! Mommy!

08:57.996 --> 09:01.123
Well, it's nice to see you.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.541
You as well.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.713
It had nothing to do with Kennedy.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.799
Still, all that vigor disappeared

09:10.884 --> 09:13.385
when he found out
he couldn't get anything done.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.304
It's Versailles.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.348
Jackie's smiling all over the world.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.058
He's chasing starlets.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.476
Everybody's happy.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.394
I'm building a bomb shelter.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.437
Really?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.232
If you see Petra, don't mention it.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.691
She doesn't want people to know.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.652
Good seeing you, Don.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.362
Let me know if you need a reference.

09:31.446 --> 09:32.446
We'd love to have you here.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.032
If l could have everyone's attention
for a moment.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.575
Please be seated.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.411
It is a tradition

09:39.496 --> 09:43.415
that we have our ribs and fashion show
on this day every year.

09:43.500 --> 09:47.419
Well, this is not to dim
our resolute admiration

09:47.504 --> 09:52.758
for the fortitude of those
who have so nobly served our country,

09:52.842 --> 09:57.096
many of whom will not be
enjoying ribs this afternoon.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.892
If you could please stand,
all servicemen,

10:01.977 --> 10:05.938
for a moment of our
insufficient appreciation.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.148
Including Lester Aaron.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.235
Lester was a Rough Rider.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.238
Please, heroes, on your feet.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.814
Can you close the door?

10:48.898 --> 10:50.941
You're letting the air out.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.484
Those look delicious.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.403
It's not the club,

10:54.487 --> 10:56.905
but at least you know
l washed my hands.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.782
How are things in the circus?

10:58.867 --> 11:00.200
Damn serious.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.203
What is this?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.621
J&B.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.290
The network sent me a case.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.959
This is why l don't have a TV.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.337
You want something else?

11:11.421 --> 11:12.504
He'll suffer through it.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.006
Do you know where you're summering?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.966
We were thinking Point O'Woods.

11:17.052 --> 11:18.385
I have to work, though.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.388
Mother's going to expect you on Fishers.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.599
I see her crossing the widow's walk
with an eye to the sea.

11:23.683 --> 11:24.808
Peter.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.560
I was on the phone
with her the other day,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.520
and you were all she talked about.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.190
- Really?
- No. I'm kidding.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.194
I don't think I know
what's funny about that.

11:35.278 --> 11:36.612
Judy, would you help me
with the corn?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.240
Now, listen. Don't scrimp.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.575
Take a vacation.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.535
Don't Trudy's folks have
some incredible vacation spread?

11:43.620 --> 11:46.121
It's not about the money, Bud.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.248
I'm νery important to the agency.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.708
My absence is felt.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.545
Yes. Well.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.758
Let's see how
the Ottomanelli Brothers treated us.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.556
And here's Annette Fogel
ready for the playa.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.725
That's Spanish for beach, gentlemen,

12:06.810 --> 12:08.644
and that's where you'll want to be.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.565
If something sportier
is what you're looking for,

12:13.650 --> 12:15.859
- check out--
- I have to go.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.152
...last year's singles champion.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.530
Really? You're really going?

12:19.614 --> 12:22.241
I wouldn't think you'd want to leaνe this.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.118
People will be working. l should stop by.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.661
Okay.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.081
You're going to miss the sparklers.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.833
Call me from the emergency room.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.585
Oh, and this delight, Judy Sawyer,

12:33.670 --> 12:36.839
is ready for the beaches of California,

12:36.923 --> 12:40.551
where she loves to do the Watusi.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.688
Room 301 .

12:56.609 --> 12:57.609
Hello.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.778
You're there. Good.

12:59.863 --> 13:00.904
Yes.

13:00.989 --> 13:04.408
But there's been a change of plans.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.243
I'm spending the day with my son.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.619
We're going to the beach.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.371
Your son?

13:09.456 --> 13:10.789
He's 1 8.

13:13.042 --> 13:15.711
I don't know why
I never brought him up.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.633
Jimmy will be at the Beverly Hills
for the next ten days.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.303
Los Angeles. That's far away.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.639
No. lt's some club in Kentucky.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.266
Still far away.

13:29.350 --> 13:33.896
I could stay out at the beach,
and you could join.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.647
You never saw it.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.149
Don't do that.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.651
What? You never think about it?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.653
No.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.948
I do. All the time.

13:45.033 --> 13:48.702
The car on its side,
your body crushing me.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.497
I don't know why I think about it.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.748
Maybe I do.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.584
I'll call you.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.544
I'd like that.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.070
Morning.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.448
Hello.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.744
I ran that "Thanks, Clearasil" thing
by my father-in-law.

15:12.829 --> 15:13.870
He loved it.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.747
I'm glad.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.959
The libraries were closed yesterday.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.294
What did you do?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.545
I was working,

15:21.629 --> 15:22.754
and then there was a barbecue.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.382
It was too hot.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.926
Trudy and I saw Liberty Valance.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.553
It goes along for a while,

15:29.637 --> 15:30.929
and then it takes a turn

15:31.014 --> 15:32.889
and ends up exactly where
you thought it was going.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.767
John Wayne shot him.

15:35.852 --> 15:37.769
Have you seen it yet?

15:37.854 --> 15:40.105
It's okay. You saved me 50 cents.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.357
I'm sorry. I hate people who do that.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.278
I know you don't like the line.

15:46.362 --> 15:49.906
Look, it's all about keeping
your father-in-law happy.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.367
I do my job, you do yours.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.120
What's that supposed to mean?

15:55.204 --> 15:57.247
Nothing.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.959
Just play with it.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.085
Okay?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.007
So you're still out there in Brooklyn?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.258
Yes.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.510
Where again?

16:10.595 --> 16:12.012
Marine Park?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.805
No, l moνed a while ago.

16:13.890 --> 16:16.266
I'm on my second apartment,
in Prospect Park.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.602
East 83rd Street.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.354
It's a ghost town.

16:20.438 --> 16:22.981
But my brother came to my cookout.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.524
Who were you with?

16:24.609 --> 16:27.653
My family.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.155
Pete, look, I really do
have a lot of work to do.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.323
Of course.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.160
Let me know where you land.

16:44.045 --> 16:44.961
How was your day off?

16:45.046 --> 16:46.838
Restful.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.757
I went to the beach.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.841
Too much, I see.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.094
I got it behind my knees.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.221
I couldn't sit down.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.806
Morning.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.891
Good morning, Mr. Sterling.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.938
Has your wife seen that yet?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.775
Do me a favor.
Let me be there when it happens.

17:06.859 --> 17:07.859
Is that why you're here?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.861
Concerned for my well-being?

17:09.946 --> 17:12.572
Here's your cigarette. Be on your way.

17:12.657 --> 17:14.449
But wait. There's more.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.868
You are going to have lunch with Duck.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.829
Perhaps on a train car,

17:18.913 --> 17:21.081
because I want you to sign an armistice
on American Airlines.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.083
What are you talking about?

17:23.167 --> 17:24.876
I've been in the meetings.

17:24.961 --> 17:28.046
Errol Flynn is gone,
and so is my taste for swordplay.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.423
You two need to put them away.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.508
I have.

17:31.592 --> 17:32.884
I've been married for over 20 years.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.846
I know the difference between a spat
and spending a month on the couch.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.389
Don't go to bed angry.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.608
Two hot chocolates.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.319
I don't want it.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.904
Sure you do.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.906
lt's good when it's hot
to drink something hot.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.909
If you continued with the Scouts,
you would have learned that.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.371
Patty, you can use the phone,
but Miss Morrison works for me, not you.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.040
Daddy has a morning meeting.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.877
There's a food cart.
It'll be here in 20 minutes.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.962
No scraps for Chauncey.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.548
I have money. I haνe $1 50.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.799
Mark.

18:12.884 --> 18:13.925
That's good.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.927
How did you get that tidy sum?

18:16.012 --> 18:17.929
Mr. Reeve gave it to me.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.389
And why would he do that?

18:22.351 --> 18:25.020
Because he wants us to be happy
when he marries Mom.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.234
We all want you to be happy.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.904
And whatever his intentions,
it's very generous.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.031
He already asked her.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.700
Well.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.955
You must haνe known eventually

18:44.040 --> 18:47.209
that your mother and I
might be starting new lives.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.503
We understand. We don't care.

18:49.587 --> 18:51.963
It's not easy for her.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.217
With you away at St. Paul's now,
she's lost her man of the house.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.053
Franklin Reeve is a good man.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.014
Mom's going to stick you with Chauncey.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.390
What?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.726
We're supposed to say good-bye to him.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.728
She can't make you do that.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.188
Dad, he's your dog.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.439
And l've learned to live without him

19:09.524 --> 19:11.525
so you two kids
could have some consistency.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.985
Frank's allergic.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.000
Your mother will be here in a half an hour.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.303
Where are we?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.305
We had an interesting idea.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.642
We?

19:45.726 --> 19:46.977
Are you on Playtex?

19:47.061 --> 19:49.187
He wants to get credit for his idea.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.814
You sure about that?

19:50.898 --> 19:55.068
Well, we went out the other night,
after the meeting--

19:55.194 --> 19:57.445
you know, a little extra hours after hours--

19:57.530 --> 19:59.030
and I looked around the bar.

19:59.115 --> 20:00.490
We all did.

20:00.575 --> 20:01.658
From what I understand,

20:01.742 --> 20:05.370
Playtex has an amazing bra,
but it doesn't take you anywhere.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.621
Well put.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.415
So I was thinking.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.792
Women right now
already have a fantasy,

20:10.877 --> 20:12.752
and it's not going up the Nile.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.754
It's right here in America.

20:14.839 --> 20:18.008
Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.467
Every single woman is one of them.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.011
Watch this.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.601
Jackie.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.395
Marilyn.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.063
Jackie.

20:32.148 --> 20:34.107
Marilyn...

20:34.233 --> 20:37.277
Well, Marilyn's really a Joan,
not the other way around.

20:43.159 --> 20:47.871
That is an idea
and an impressiνe presentation.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.082
Well, you always say
it's a 24-hour-a-day job.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.251
Apparently, I've already signed off on it.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.302
I don't know if all women
are a Jackie or a Marilyn.

21:02.386 --> 21:04.179
Maybe men see them that way.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.097
Bras are for men.

21:06.182 --> 21:09.059
Women want to see themselves
the way men see them.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.186
You're a Jackie or a Marilyn--

21:11.270 --> 21:12.771
a line and a curve.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.230
Nothing goes better together.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.107
Which do you think I am?

21:16.192 --> 21:17.692
Gertrude Stein.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.112
I would say you're more classical,

21:21.197 --> 21:22.822
Hellenic.

21:22.907 --> 21:24.199
Irene Dunne.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.452
I loνe Irene Dunne.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.913
Peggy, you're going
to have company on this.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.748
Congratulations, Kinsey.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.209
You forced your way onto an account.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.379
Mr. Phillips is here.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.673
Sorry I'm late.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.132
Get back. Out.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.134
Who's the new account man?

21:43.219 --> 21:45.887
It's Chauncey. Sorry about that.

21:45.972 --> 21:49.140
Listen, any idea
when l can schedule Playtex?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.308
We're laying track.

21:50.393 --> 21:52.227
I think you can bring
the train in tomorrow.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.937
Something new, l hope.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.147
Can l drop some crumbs, at least?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.733
Two sides of one woman--

21:58.818 --> 22:01.528
Jackie by day, Marilyn by night.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.488
Maybe it's two girls.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.448
But definitely two flavors--

22:05.533 --> 22:06.825
vanilla and cherry.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.159
Sounds good.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.161
Don, your girl says you're free for lunch.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.955
She's in charge.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.206
Come on, Chauncey.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.333
Come on.

22:16.794 --> 22:19.254
Thought you all were listening.
Let's go.

22:20.923 --> 22:21.923
Freddie.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.383
What, sweetheart?

22:26.262 --> 22:29.431
I wish you would have told me
you were going to work Tuesday night.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.598
If you have something better,

22:30.683 --> 22:32.142
I'll run it by Don.

22:32.226 --> 22:34.019
He already likes that.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.937
Yes, he does.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.272
Isn't that our goal?

22:38.441 --> 22:40.191
I'm not saying l had a better idea,

22:40.276 --> 22:42.193
but now I'm not eνen a part of it.

22:42.278 --> 22:43.945
All I had to do was be in that bar.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.823
Believe me,
you didn't want to be in that bar.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.241
The work's done.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.994
Now go write me some titillating copy.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.508
Mr. Draper is here to see you.

23:05.593 --> 23:06.968
Send him in.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.223
Are you coming by to pick me up?

23:12.308 --> 23:14.225
No.

23:14.310 --> 23:18.021
It's just l wasn't really planning
on coming back after lunch.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.398
Any way we can have
this conversation now?

23:20.483 --> 23:22.025
Conversation?

23:22.109 --> 23:24.611
Roger told me it was
just a friendly lunch.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.489
I know.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.907
People start giving you things.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.325
They think it's cute.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.535
I've got a crate of that crap somewhere.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.249
That's quite a playing field you have there.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.335
I don't like anything on it but ashes.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.422
I thought maybe your secretary
was better than mine.

23:44.507 --> 23:47.217
Nobody's secretary's better than yours.

23:47.301 --> 23:49.552
You creative directors.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.308
All l can say is it's been hard
to figure things out around here.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.519
Eighteen months in?

23:57.603 --> 23:59.354
We can't be that unusual.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.107
I'm doing the job you hired me to do.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.776
I tell people that Sterling Cooper
is the only place to be.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.779
You've been pitching more to me
than you have to clients.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.280
What does that mean?

24:09.365 --> 24:13.034
It means you've been
selling their ideas to me

24:13.119 --> 24:14.369
more than mine to them.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.793
When I was in the Marine Corps,
I missed duty.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.670
Fell down the steps or something.

24:23.754 --> 24:28.758
My squad leader covered,
but then I confessed to the men.

24:28.843 --> 24:33.513
He laid down some rifle fire for me,
and I acted like l didn't need it.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.849
That's not the situation
l want to be in here.

24:35.933 --> 24:38.852
So what, you're covering for me?

24:38.936 --> 24:40.687
Who am l in this story?

24:40.771 --> 24:42.313
I'm grateful, Don.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.858
If you hadn't brought me in,
where would l be?

24:44.942 --> 24:47.318
Some fifth wheel at McCann?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.238
Look, I did everything I could
for you on American Airlines.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.282
It was a risk worth taking.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.242
People think of us differently.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.202
What do you want me to say?

24:56.287 --> 24:57.579
That we're on the same team?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.330
That I love being in your unit?

24:59.415 --> 25:01.916
Sarge, I'm scared?

25:02.001 --> 25:04.836
You have an "I told you so," okay?

25:04.920 --> 25:07.005
Can we move forward?

25:07.089 --> 25:09.174
I'm the one that looks bad.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.884
It hasn't hurt the company.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.098
Yes.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.433
Of course we can.

25:21.395 --> 25:23.354
And I will tell Roger we had lunch.

25:23.439 --> 25:26.107
Well. Good, then.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.358
Okay.

25:45.002 --> 25:47.003
Where did you come from?

25:49.173 --> 25:50.673
You don't want to know.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.643
Wait.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.188
I loνe it.

26:05.272 --> 26:09.108
I'm warm and l'm cold.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.488
What time is it?

26:18.911 --> 26:20.703
A little after 4.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.915
I have to get ready.

26:25.501 --> 26:26.960
Where are you going?

26:27.044 --> 26:28.544
My daughter's in a play.

26:28.629 --> 26:31.339
Daughter?

26:31.423 --> 26:32.757
Is that everyone?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.511
She's at Sarah Lawrence.

26:43.894 --> 26:45.520
How much preparation do you need?

26:48.524 --> 26:50.775
You don't want me to go.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.696
I took the afternoon off.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.281
For me?

27:02.538 --> 27:05.540
You're a lion, aren't you?

27:06.709 --> 27:08.751
Now l know what you like.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.964
You can go.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.550
I know I can.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.513
Do you want to stay here?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.473
Watch TV?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.726
Go through my things?

27:26.687 --> 27:30.440
I would never leave you alone in my place.

27:30.524 --> 27:32.483
Yes, you would.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.694
Stay.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.154
Relax.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.408
Believe me, I'm the same way.

27:42.703 --> 27:45.788
It has to come out somewhere.

27:51.045 --> 27:54.297
I'll get you out in time
for dinner, I promise.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.757
What's going on?

27:58.510 --> 27:59.510
You here to audition?

27:59.595 --> 28:01.512
No one told me about this.

28:01.597 --> 28:04.474
I'm taking pictures.
You can look at the pictures.

28:04.558 --> 28:06.059
I didn't know you'd want to come.

28:06.143 --> 28:08.519
Is Paul in there?

28:08.604 --> 28:10.396
A lot of guys are in there.

28:10.481 --> 28:11.856
You can come in if you want.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.651
No. I'm just surprised
because I have an eye for this.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.320
Don't worry about Kinsey.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.322
I won't let him put anything together
without you.

28:20.699 --> 28:21.699
Who's next?

28:33.170 --> 28:34.420
Hey, girl.

28:36.632 --> 28:38.383
You look lost.

28:38.467 --> 28:39.550
Chauncey.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.885
Here he is.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.553
I apologize, Chauncey.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.555
I thought you were a girl.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.224
Beautiful dog.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.225
Where have you been hiding him?

28:47.309 --> 28:50.228
I made my wife giνe him back to me.

28:50.312 --> 28:52.021
Missed him too much.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.564
I like dogs.

28:53.649 --> 28:54.941
Dogs are better than wives.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.275
Never a problem communicating.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.445
I like having one in the office.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.697
Makes us look more easygoing,

29:01.782 --> 29:04.575
friendly, you know, to clients.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.868
Maybe I'll bring one in, too.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.703
What breed do you have?

29:07.788 --> 29:10.289
I don't have one.

29:10.374 --> 29:12.208
I was going to get one for the office.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.086
I don't think that's a good idea.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.130
Good night, Campbell.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.423
Come on, Chauncey.

29:41.905 --> 29:44.615
What were you doing
in Sterling Cooper?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.909
There was a casting call for Playtex.

29:46.994 --> 29:48.202
Right.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.998
The fellas are calling it the bra-ditions.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.958
That's funny.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.418
You work there?

29:55.502 --> 29:57.170
I do.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.630
Want me to find out how it went?

29:59.715 --> 30:02.633
I already know. Not well.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.428
I find that hard to believe.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.513
Well, they fall in love
with a picture of you,

30:07.598 --> 30:09.640
and then you come in,
and they're disappointed.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.728
But it doesn't make any sense
because all they need is a picture.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.440
I didn't bring my camera with me,

30:17.524 --> 30:20.151
but I can't imagine it
being better than this.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.655
I don't know. Maybe I look tired.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.200
I just flew back from working in London.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.993
London?

30:32.164 --> 30:33.164
What's your name?

30:37.294 --> 30:38.753
Peter Campbell.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.632
Oh, my. Account executive.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.152
I loνe the taste of Scotch.

31:08.075 --> 31:09.659
Thank you.

31:12.663 --> 31:14.705
Stop. Turn around.

31:14.790 --> 31:15.998
Let me look at you.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.005
When I first saw you,

31:23.090 --> 31:24.715
I thought you were foreign.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.426
Really? Is that right?

31:29.471 --> 31:30.888
Hold that.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.643
I have company.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.275
I'll be right back.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.253
Who was that?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.422
- My mother.
- Really?

32:04.506 --> 32:06.090
What, you didn't think I had a mother?

32:06.174 --> 32:08.843
It's okay.

32:20.814 --> 32:21.856
Hold on.

32:29.656 --> 32:32.867
Up the long, delirious, burning blue,

32:32.951 --> 32:37.204
I topped the windswept
heights with easy grace

32:37.289 --> 32:41.167
where never lark or even eagle flew.

32:44.046 --> 32:47.006
And while with silent lifting mind

32:47.090 --> 32:49.800
I strode the high untrespassed

32:49.885 --> 32:52.928
sanctity of space,

32:53.013 --> 32:55.222
put out my hand,

32:55.307 --> 32:59.477
and touched the face of God.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.566
You want me to fix you something?

33:49.111 --> 33:50.403
What's that?

33:50.487 --> 33:51.821
Cereal.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.155
No. That.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.409
Do you like it?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.744
I bought it at the auction.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.955
Can I speak to you a minute?

34:06.962 --> 34:08.212
What? What's wrong?

34:08.296 --> 34:09.880
Where are you going in that?

34:09.965 --> 34:11.841
Swimming.

34:11.925 --> 34:14.468
You asked me if I like it. I don't.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.011
What are you talking about?

34:16.096 --> 34:18.931
l'm talking about
a 1 5-year-old lifeguard.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.599
I'm talking about
a bunch of tennis pros,

34:20.684 --> 34:23.269
not to mention all those loafing
millionaires taking the summer off.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.396
- Do you want to be ogled?
- Oh, Don.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.231
Everybody bought one at the auction.

34:27.315 --> 34:29.150
It's desperate.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.613
I didn't know that.

34:36.700 --> 34:37.908
I have to go.

34:37.993 --> 34:39.410
See you tonight.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.048
Joan, there you are.

34:53.133 --> 34:55.926
Are you aware that l'm
on the Playtex account?

34:56.011 --> 34:56.927
What about it?

34:57.012 --> 35:00.598
Please tell the girls
I am to be included in all the memos.

35:00.682 --> 35:02.475
Sure. For a moment there,

35:02.559 --> 35:05.227
I thought you were just another person
coming to ask me about my brassiere.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.313
Why aren't I on the list?

35:08.690 --> 35:09.940
I don't know what to tell you.

35:10.025 --> 35:11.942
I'm not inνolνed in that.

35:12.027 --> 35:16.781
There's business going on,
and I'm not invited.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.032
I'm a good drinker.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.201
What are you asking me?

35:20.285 --> 35:21.952
You know how this office works.

35:22.037 --> 35:23.704
Parts of it.

35:24.706 --> 35:25.664
Forget it.

35:25.749 --> 35:27.958
I've never had your job.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.877
I've never wanted it.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.670
You're in their country.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.506
Learn to speak the language.

35:33.590 --> 35:35.424
You don't talk that way.

35:35.509 --> 35:37.676
I don't need to.

35:37.761 --> 35:40.137
And honestly,

35:40.222 --> 35:42.139
you've never listened to a word I've said.

35:43.809 --> 35:46.560
You want to be taken seriously?

35:46.645 --> 35:48.771
Stop dressing like a little girl.

35:52.609 --> 35:56.070
Jacqueline Kennedy,
Marilyn Monroe.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.072
Women have feelings
about these women

35:58.156 --> 35:59.824
because men do.

35:59.908 --> 36:03.536
Because we want both,
they want to be both.

36:03.620 --> 36:06.914
It's about how they want
to be seen by us--

36:06.998 --> 36:08.999
their husbands, their boyfriends,

36:09.084 --> 36:10.459
their friends' husbands.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.045
Here's the idea, very simply.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.130
The bra is called the Harlequin.

36:15.215 --> 36:18.300
In fit and form,
it should be your νery best.

36:18.385 --> 36:21.262
It comes in black and white.

36:25.684 --> 36:27.476
Jackie, Marilyn.

36:27.561 --> 36:29.687
Same incredible fit,

36:29.771 --> 36:31.981
two different women.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.066
And the beauty of it is
it's the same woman,

36:34.192 --> 36:35.693
the same model.

36:35.777 --> 36:37.152
Look at that. lt is.

36:37.237 --> 36:39.321
And even if you don't notice it,

36:39.406 --> 36:40.698
you still get a bit of an "Aha"

36:40.782 --> 36:42.032
when you read the copy.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.951
"Nothing fits both sides of a woman

36:44.035 --> 36:46.370
better than Playtex."

36:48.623 --> 36:51.792
It's a very impressive idea, Don.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.043
I like the girl.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.255
So will your customers.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.048
It's a very flattering mirror.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.509
This definitely moves you
into Maidenform's neighborhood.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.805
But sales have been so good

37:04.890 --> 37:07.224
when we talk about
how well our brassieres fit.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.686
I don't know what to say.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.439
We were talking in the cab
on the way over.

37:13.523 --> 37:17.610
Let Maidenform have
women's imaginations.

37:17.694 --> 37:19.820
We'll take their money.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.073
I couldn't have said it better myself.

37:23.158 --> 37:26.076
Well, I apologize for the goose chase.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.079
We're very sorry.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.790
No one else can have
this campaign, right?

37:31.875 --> 37:33.334
It's yours.

37:33.418 --> 37:34.919
We'll keep it on file for you.

37:36.546 --> 37:37.880
A pleasure.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.465
- Thanks again.
- Thanks for coming in.

37:41.009 --> 37:43.260
That was a waste of inspiration.

37:43.345 --> 37:45.679
These people.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.848
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

37:47.933 --> 37:49.725
They made up their minds
on the way over.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.393
Why put up a fight?

37:51.478 --> 37:54.104
I think we bought
a couple years of security.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.856
If they ever decide
they want to go that way,

37:55.941 --> 37:57.191
they know we can do it.

37:59.194 --> 38:02.112
Listen, we would love
to show our appreciation

38:02.197 --> 38:03.697
by entertaining
you gentlemen tonight.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.908
And you can put it on our bill.

38:05.992 --> 38:08.243
Make sure Don knows he's invited.

38:08.328 --> 38:09.662
Where should we go?

38:09.746 --> 38:10.788
Surprise us.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.832
If we were to take you
to see some girls in their underwear,

38:13.917 --> 38:15.459
would you feel like you're at work?

38:15.543 --> 38:17.252
No. That sounds good.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.380
Well, let us clear the decks.

38:19.464 --> 38:20.839
6:30 at the Tom-Tom.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.883
That's on 44th and 8th.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.511
We will be there,
and the tab will be open.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.639
I'm going to go tell Campbell.

38:28.723 --> 38:29.848
Take care.

38:29.933 --> 38:30.933
Good to see you.

38:31.017 --> 38:32.226
- See you there.
- Bye-bye.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.161
Mr. Phillips.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.622
We have artwork
in the evening papers, son,

38:53.707 --> 38:54.790
and I don't haνe them.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.291
Someone's supposed
to put them on my desk,

38:56.376 --> 38:57.292
Friday or not.

38:57.377 --> 38:58.669
Should I get some?

38:58.753 --> 39:00.254
What do you think?

39:02.048 --> 39:03.257
I'll be right back.

40:19.876 --> 40:23.754
It's flattering to be able
to keep you interested.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.339
Stop talking.

40:48.530 --> 40:51.782
Why don't you want me to talk?

40:51.866 --> 40:54.576
You know you want me to.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.245
Do I?

40:56.329 --> 40:57.913
You do.

41:11.177 --> 41:12.553
Touch me.

41:12.637 --> 41:14.388
No.

41:22.856 --> 41:24.398
Don't stop torturing me.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.402
I want the full Don Draper treatment.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.028
You're spoiling the mood.

41:30.113 --> 41:32.239
I wanted it, and I got it,

41:32.323 --> 41:33.907
and it's better than they said.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.410
What?

41:38.788 --> 41:40.873
Have no fear.

41:40.957 --> 41:43.417
You're known as a connoisseur.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.336
You have lots of fans.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.881
Are you talking about me?

41:48.965 --> 41:50.632
I wasn't, no.

41:50.717 --> 41:52.009
Well, who was?

41:52.093 --> 41:53.385
What?

41:56.806 --> 41:57.806
Who?

41:59.058 --> 42:01.560
Sarah Tierney at Random House.

42:06.441 --> 42:08.400
I don't know who you're talking about.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.402
Stop.

42:11.529 --> 42:14.740
This is nobody's maiden voyage here,

42:14.824 --> 42:16.283
handsome.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.704
You have a reputation.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.457
Enjoy it.

42:31.883 --> 42:35.302
Does it make you feel better
to think that I'm like you?

42:46.189 --> 42:48.440
My goodness.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.442
Gloνes come off.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.077
I like this.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.204
You want to blindfold me?

43:07.335 --> 43:09.336
What are you doing?

43:09.420 --> 43:10.587
Are you going?

43:14.801 --> 43:17.261
I told you to stop talking.

43:28.523 --> 43:29.731
Thank you.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.757
People are going to think
you're the mayor.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.234
Hey, look, it's Peggy.

44:14.319 --> 44:15.902
What are you doing here?

44:15.987 --> 44:17.529
I don't know.
I heard we were celebrating.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.072
I thought l'd stop by.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.490
Did you now?

44:20.575 --> 44:22.492
- Stay for one drink.
- Okay.

44:22.577 --> 44:25.454
You're staying all night, honey.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.497
Now you got the best seat
in the house.

44:27.582 --> 44:29.666
Tell me what you want for Christmas.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.258
Yeah!

45:34.232 --> 45:36.566
What do you want for breakfast?

45:36.651 --> 45:37.984
Grapefruit.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.748
Hey, Daddy.

45:52.750 --> 45:53.792
Hey, you.

46:03.136 --> 46:04.594
I'm not going to talk.

46:04.679 --> 46:06.930
I don't want you to cut yourself.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.790
Are you okay, Daddy?

46:36.711 --> 46:37.669
You know what, Sally?

46:37.795 --> 46:39.921
I think you better leave me alone.
