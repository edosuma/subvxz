00:36.560 --> 00:38.660
Bells will ring
at the New York Stock Exchange

00:38.760 --> 00:41.445
for another day, on this March 18th.

00:44.280 --> 00:47.329
Okay, here we go. Are you listening?

00:47.440 --> 00:49.580
Are you paying attention out there?

00:49.680 --> 00:52.500
Good. Because it's about to get complicated,

00:52.600 --> 00:55.922
so I'm gonna start out slow
and make it nice and simple for you.

00:56.440 --> 00:59.364
You don't have a clue where your money is.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.060
See, once upon a time,

01:01.160 --> 01:04.099
you could walk into your bank,
and they'd open a vault

01:04.200 --> 01:06.362
and point to a gold brick.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.540
Not anymore.

01:08.640 --> 01:11.420
Your money, that thing that
you bust your ass for,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.060
it's nothing more
than a few photons of energy

01:14.160 --> 01:17.960
traveling through a massive
network of fiber optic cables.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.900
Why'd we do it?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.207
We did it to make it go faster.

01:22.680 --> 01:25.206
Because your money better be fast.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.564
Faster than the other guy's.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.740
But if you want faster markets
with faster trades,

01:30.840 --> 01:33.161
faster profits, faster everything,

01:34.320 --> 01:36.084
sometimes you're gonna blow a tire.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.580
And that is exactly what happened yesterday

01:38.680 --> 01:42.127
at 1:07 p.m., Eastern Standard Time.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.380
After heavy after-hours trading,
Ibis's stock price took an historic $67...

01:48.480 --> 01:50.687
...run by high-frequency
trading pioneer Walt Camby,

01:51.080 --> 01:54.580
disclosed that an algorithm managing
its portfolio suddenly went haywire.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.500
The trading algorithm seems to have
experienced an unexplained anomaly.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.020
A glitch.

01:59.120 --> 02:02.020
Shares of Ibis Clear Capital
getting killed this morning.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.620
...net loss of over $800 million.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.460
- It has gone haywire.
- An algorithm...

02:06.560 --> 02:07.540
- ...glitch...
- ...a glitch...

02:07.640 --> 02:08.900
- ...glitch!
- A glitch.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.460
Okay, so Ibis took a beating yesterday,

02:11.560 --> 02:14.420
but if you've been paying attention to me
for the past 16 months,

02:14.520 --> 02:17.490
Walt Camby has made you a lot of money.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.605
But if you were late to the party,
I'm not going to sugarcoat it,

02:23.240 --> 02:24.969
you got your ass smacked yesterday.

02:25.080 --> 02:29.369
But this is only the first round.
Because this, my friend, is an opportunity.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.524
So here's what you're gonna do.

02:31.920 --> 02:35.300
You're gonna stop whining,
and you're gonna get back in the ring

02:35.400 --> 02:37.129
because this stock is coming back.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.244
You know what that means?

02:40.760 --> 02:42.410
Let's go throw some punches.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.404
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

02:56.440 --> 02:57.780
What do you mean he's ordained?

02:57.880 --> 03:00.850
No, on a plane, Lee. A plane.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.500
All right. That makes more sense.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.780
Wait, Walt Camby's on a plane?

03:05.880 --> 03:08.645
Can you pick up the pace, please?
It's like dealing with my grandmother.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.761
Come on, I'm not having a conversation
with you through the goddamn door.

03:14.560 --> 03:17.300
All right, I'll leave it open next time.

03:17.400 --> 03:21.700
Wait, now, why the hell would Walt cancel?
He called me from Geneva yesterday.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.180
I don't know. He's on a plane.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.340
And how are we
just finding out about it now?

03:25.440 --> 03:26.441
That is a great question.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.300
You can ask him
the next time you talk to him.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.220
Here. First one's a yes. Second one's a no.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.980
Third one's just a signature.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.740
- Ten minutes, Mr. Gates.
- All right.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.860
- Thanks, Gen.
- Yep.

03:36.960 --> 03:40.660
The fill-in's name is Diane Lester.
They're setting up her remote feed now.

03:40.760 --> 03:43.940
- Who the hell is Diane Lester?
- She is the Chief Communications Officer.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.042
She wrote all the talking points anyway,
so should be fine.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.700
When am I getting
the revisions for the opening?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.660
We're making some changes on it.
Anybody seen Ron?

03:49.760 --> 03:51.460
Might I get those before the show
or after the show?

03:51.560 --> 03:53.700
You know the drill.
You just point the camera in my direction,

03:53.800 --> 03:54.801
and we'll figure it out together.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.500
It always sounds so simple
and yet so moronic.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.100
All right. Look out, fellas. Here we come.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.900
Edgar Rosenthal's office called.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.740
- He can't make dinner tonight.
- Thank Christ.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.740
Dinner at the nursing home with my nan
is more exciting than dinner with that guy.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.220
This is the 7th reschedule.
So can I just move it to the TBD list?

04:08.320 --> 04:10.060
Wait a minute, it's the 7th time
he's rescheduled on me?

04:10.160 --> 04:11.400
Yes, that's correct.

04:11.760 --> 04:13.330
That's ridiculous.
I'm calling him on his cell.

04:13.440 --> 04:14.900
Well, his office said that he's in a meeting.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.844
- Hey, Freddy, nice call on the yen yesterday.
- Eat a dick, Lee.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.980
Lee, this is Diane Lester.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.500
Alan, can you bring the boom in
for me, please?

04:23.600 --> 04:25.700
Ed! It's Lee Iacocca.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.820
Listen, I changed my mind
on this whole retirement thing.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.082
Turns out I want your job after all.

04:31.320 --> 04:32.606
Yeah, it's Gates.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.288
Okay. All right, I'll talk to you later.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.980
All right.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.500
So no dinner.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.365
Lee. Follow the noise. Diane Lester.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.940
- Memo of talking points.
- Hello? Hello?

04:45.040 --> 04:47.180
You guys at Ibis can't do anything
right these days, can you?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.620
Look, I'm really sorry to put you
in this situation, Lee.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.060
I fit was something we could control,
believe me, we would.

04:52.160 --> 04:54.860
I'm not the enemy here, Diane.
I'm friendly fire.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.500
We know that.
If you read my talking points...

04:56.600 --> 04:57.780
Guy's a billionaire. He owns how many jets?

04:57.880 --> 04:59.620
- ...Walt has already addressed the glitch...
- Five minutes!

04:59.720 --> 05:01.460
'Cause commercial flights, they get delayed,

05:01.560 --> 05:03.608
but private ones,
they get to do whatever the hell they want.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.220
- Ron! Where's Ron?
- I'm not sure. But here's a list of dinners...

05:07.320 --> 05:09.740
We'll be with you in less than five, Diane.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.500
Look at that. I wouldn't invite
any of those people to an audit.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.620
Ron!

05:13.720 --> 05:16.460
Ron. There you are.
Is that my Canadian commodities data?

05:16.560 --> 05:17.940
Yeah, yeah. Sorry.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.500
Sorry, I just ran all the way back
from the Village.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.300
I had a meeting with Tony Biscano
at Licem Pharmaceutical.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.640
Lee, I'll be in your ear.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.082
He gave me this.

05:29.760 --> 05:33.082
- What is it?
- It's erectile cream.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.500
Tony Biscano of Licem
gave you erectile cream?

05:36.600 --> 05:37.580
Yeah.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.740
I guess I wasn't aware of the exact nature
of your relationship.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.180
They've been testing this thing
for over a year

05:41.280 --> 05:42.940
and the approval from the FDA
finally came in last night.

05:43.040 --> 05:44.060
They're sending out a press release...

05:44.160 --> 05:46.340
- And it works?
- Apparently, yeah. Pretty damn well.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.140
- Have you tried it?
- I just got it, 30 minutes ago.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.340
- What the hell are you waiting for?
- You want me to...

05:50.440 --> 05:52.966
We're on in five minutes, aren't we?
Put it on!

05:54.280 --> 05:56.620
Mr. Gates, you need this.
Don't forget your talking points.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.609
Yeah, yeah. Put it on my desk.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.380
Okay, where is Diane Lester?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.687
She's all checked in on remote six.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.180
Who writes this shit?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.860
- Is the graphics package loaded?
- Last one is just coming in.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.100
Great.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.100
We are still working off the rehearsal script
for the opening, guys.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.340
But he didn't even stick
to the rehearsal script at rehearsal.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.020
- So, about dinner... Did you...
- Okay, you wore me down.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.220
I'm sorry?

06:19.320 --> 06:23.060
I'll go to dinner with you.
We'll go to Scalinatella's, let's say 9:30?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.020
I still have a boyfriend, Lee.
Just like I did yesterday.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.380
Yeah, he's still a bartender in Hoboken,
like he was yesterday.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.700
- Will this work, boss?
- This is a stuffed parrot.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.220
I said I wanted a live pigeon.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.300
Patty, God damn it.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.540
We don't have a live pigeon.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.460
- Admit it. You're gonna miss this.
- You can't find a live pigeon?

06:35.560 --> 06:38.700
I'm sure there are plenty of
emotionally stunted 7-year-olds

06:38.800 --> 06:41.180
hosting TV shows across the street.
Thank you.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.100
Cover yourself...
Roll with yourself in breadcrumbs

06:43.200 --> 06:44.260
and bring a fucking bird up here.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.580
Jim, can you punch Diane
up on the preview for me, please?

06:46.680 --> 06:47.900
Sure. There she is.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.180
Patty? Patty?

06:49.280 --> 06:52.409
- Hi, Diane, can you hear me?
- Yes. Yes, I can.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.900
Lee has read the talking points, right?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.180
Because I'm in a tough position here,

06:56.280 --> 06:58.300
and I just want to make sure
that he sticks to the script.

06:58.400 --> 07:02.420
He will. You know us, Diane.
We don't do "gotcha" journalism here.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.807
Hell, we don't do journalism, period.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.924
Scream one is up.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.683
Check. Check. Check.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.260
Money... Money... Money Monster.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.521
About time.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.081
All right, I'm ready.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.100
So, here's a novel idea.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.044
How about you just pick up
some takeout on your way home.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.900
God, stop. I'm getting depressed.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.731
Get into your most comfortable
pair of pajamas.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.540
No, no, no. This isn't really
a Friday night for you, is it? Can't be.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.700
Curl right up in front of the TV?

07:40.800 --> 07:45.647
It's 'cause the idea of television and
pajamas and takeout, good God, it's like...

07:46.200 --> 07:49.260
You get a pool cue, and I want you to
sharpen it down to a fine point.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.011
And I want you to shove it
straight through my eye.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.300
- Hold on a sec, Lee.
- Right into my brain.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.060
You're killing me here, Lenny.
Check your mark, please.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.300
You know what?
I drifted and I forgot to lock.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.561
Balls.

08:02.880 --> 08:03.900
That's it.

08:04.000 --> 08:07.322
I would rather you do that
than sitting at home in my underwear

08:08.080 --> 08:10.082
watching "Suck-My-QVC."

08:27.680 --> 08:29.340
Look at the new guy.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.220
Where's Leroy? Finally canned his ass.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.321
One minute to air.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.980
One minute. Clear the stage, please.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.419
Patty, honest answer.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.659
How many nights a week
do you eat dinner in your pajamas?

08:38.760 --> 08:41.820
Like, on average, over the course
of my life? Or just since James left?

08:41.919 --> 08:43.179
Listen, listen.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.660
Because I haven't eaten dinner alone
since the '90s. That's hand to God.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.460
Well, that's just awful.
That just makes me feel sorry for you.

08:49.560 --> 08:50.940
Why do you feel sorry for me?

08:51.040 --> 08:54.089
Hang on, Patty. Just one second.
Ron, you walking hard or what?

08:55.120 --> 08:56.860
This stuff is incredible.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.700
I'm talking zero to 60 in,
like, 20 seconds flat.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.020
Good, so it's a buy, then.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.540
All right. Put it away and find me
a better lead for next week's show.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.620
Put it away?

09:04.720 --> 09:05.780
- Lee, necklace.
- Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

09:05.880 --> 09:06.860
Thirty seconds till air. Thirty seconds.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.180
Where's my hat?

09:08.280 --> 09:10.660
Can we turn down the contrast
on her a little bit, please?

09:10.760 --> 09:11.761
Sure.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.540
- How's that?
- That's better. Thank you.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.801
- Fifteen seconds.
- Okay.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.247
Here we go. Good luck, everybody.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.762
- Open on VT 16.
- Ten, nine...

09:19.960 --> 09:21.962
- Coming out of the opening to camera 3.
- ...eight, seven...

09:22.320 --> 09:23.380
Six,

09:23.480 --> 09:24.540
five,

09:24.640 --> 09:25.580
four,

09:25.680 --> 09:27.380
three, two,

09:27.480 --> 09:29.448
- one.
- Track rollup.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.725
Here he is,
the wizard of Wall Street himself, Lee Gates.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.285
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

09:45.680 --> 09:49.480
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'
I welcome the money and the cash

09:50.120 --> 09:54.460
At the welcome mat swollen fat
In stupid stacks, the cash

09:54.560 --> 09:56.881
My money ain't funny and it keep comin'...

09:57.200 --> 09:59.646
Thank you very much.
The name is Lee Gates.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.700
The show is Money Monster,

10:01.800 --> 10:03.006
the day is Friday,

10:03.120 --> 10:06.500
and the Dow has dropped a seismic
seven points this morning.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.500
- Ready scream one.
- So what does that mean for the market...

10:08.600 --> 10:09.647
Should you...

10:12.480 --> 10:13.460
Ready cheer three.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.925
- ...or should you...
- Roll.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.780
And the answer is,
who cares about the Dow?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.340
It's a measly 30 companies.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.841
So why do you people
keep paying attention to it?

10:22.360 --> 10:24.540
Probably because
our network insists on tracking it.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.980
- Right here at the bottom of the screen...
- Not sticking to the script.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.460
...in large font all day.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.140
- Why does he keep talking?
- And why do they do that?

10:30.240 --> 10:31.780
Sacajawea, Lee.

10:31.880 --> 10:34.660
Because you people keep paying
so much attention to it.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.020
Sacajawea.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.168
- And the circle just keeps on turning.
- Shut up.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.140
Thank you.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.686
So let's try to ignore it.
Let's try to ignore it for one day.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.322
One day, and talk about the thing
that everybody else is talking about.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.180
Ibis Clear Capital is down another quarter
to $8.40,

10:52.280 --> 10:54.931
but rather than grabbing the third rail

10:56.480 --> 10:58.020
and losing control of our bowels,

10:58.120 --> 11:00.460
we here at Money Monster like to go...

11:00.560 --> 11:02.300
Straight to the Source!

11:02.400 --> 11:03.481
Straight to the source.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.980
As it turns out, Walt Camby is
35,000 feet in the air right now,

11:07.080 --> 11:09.811
but we have somebody
far prettier right here at sea level.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.540
It's his right-hand gal, Diane...

11:11.640 --> 11:13.180
- It's Lester.
- Lester.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.780
Is gonna be on the show
in a little while to explain

11:15.880 --> 11:17.660
not only what went wrong last week,

11:17.760 --> 11:21.420
but, more importantly,
what they're gonna do to fix it.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.841
But first,
let's talk market Movers and Shakers.

11:24.560 --> 11:27.340
Jim, cue clip package two and three
in case he skips one.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.500
Two and three?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.762
You're wondering,
"Should I sell? Should I unload?"

11:32.040 --> 11:33.180
You know what I'm gonna say to you.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.281
Roll balls.

11:36.600 --> 11:39.285
Grow some balls, man! Man up!

11:40.120 --> 11:41.180
Good one.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.090
Man up! Lenny, let me hear you say it.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.201
Lenny, let me hear it.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.060
Look at these numbers. See these?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.180
These are the stock prices
over the last three months.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.580
See these drops?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.700
Get used to it. It's just the way
the market works these days.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.420
Look at this. $3.50 here.
Almost five bucks there.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.140
If you panicked here, you would have sold...

11:58.240 --> 12:00.980
- Who's that guy?
- Who's what guy?

12:01.080 --> 12:03.321
- ...you whiners, you chickens.
- Camera 2.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.860
You know what I'm gonna tell you to do.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.645
Mark, can you pan over?
Do you see that guy?

12:09.240 --> 12:12.540
We're talking about 89% return. Even the
Teamsters get excited about these numbers.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.007
Somebody didn't tell me something.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.491
Looks like a delivery guy.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.780
Say it. I'm not gonna move until you say it.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.540
- Balls.
- Balls!

12:21.640 --> 12:23.220
There it is! Just under the wire.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.041
All right. Now, for the rest of you,
you know what that means.

12:27.760 --> 12:32.580
It's time for today's
"Can't Miss Stock Tip of the Millennium."

12:32.680 --> 12:34.140
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.900
Telecommunications.
Forget the top-rated stocks.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.660
Well, here he comes.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.242
Okay, Mark, stay with this guy.
I don't know who he is.

12:42.360 --> 12:45.380
Alan, there's no chance he's miked,
so just boom him in.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.481
Let's see what happens.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.180
Hopefully you've been listening
to our little birdy.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.100
Where's that stupid parrot?

12:51.200 --> 12:52.201
You got a delivery?

12:54.520 --> 12:56.124
- Don't move.
- What the hell?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.691
Is this a union thing?

12:59.960 --> 13:01.121
Jesus!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.611
Cut the feed.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.846
Turn those cameras back on!

13:08.160 --> 13:10.288
- Turn those cameras back on!
- Jesus Christ!

13:10.960 --> 13:13.486
Whoever's in there,
turn those cameras back on, right now!

13:13.640 --> 13:15.460
- I can't. Once I turn them off...
- You're lying!

13:15.560 --> 13:17.860
Turn the cameras back on
or I'm gonna shoot him in his head!

13:17.960 --> 13:19.980
Turn the cameras on, Patty! Turn them on!

13:20.080 --> 13:21.100
Patty?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.167
Patty!

13:22.280 --> 13:23.580
All right, I'm gonna count to three,

13:23.680 --> 13:25.125
- then I swear to God...
- Do something!

13:25.240 --> 13:26.340
- ...I'm pulling this trigger. One...
- Patty!

13:26.440 --> 13:27.771
Patty, what do you want me to do?

13:27.880 --> 13:29.245
- Turn them on, Patty!
- Two...

13:29.480 --> 13:30.845
- Patty!
- Three!

13:31.000 --> 13:32.729
- What do you want me to do?
- Put it up.

13:35.560 --> 13:36.925
Are we live?

13:37.360 --> 13:39.044
Yeah, we're live.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.540
All right, turn the cameras off again

13:40.640 --> 13:42.140
I'm gonna shoot him in his head.
You hear me?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.300
Everybody understands.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.940
- Don't try any tricks with the monitors.
- Call security.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.140
I got the whole broadcast here on my phone.

13:47.240 --> 13:50.722
If I see anything other than us,
I'm gonna shoot him in his head, all right?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.180
- Do you understand me?
- Everybody understands you.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.140
Everybody understands.
We stay on the air. All right.

13:56.240 --> 13:58.368
- We're staying on the air.
- Good.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.481
Good.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.740
No, wait.

14:02.840 --> 14:03.887
He's not picking up.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.260
- Okay.
- Pick a box.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.580
What do you mean?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.500
- I said, "Pick a box."
- What happens if I pick the wrong box?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.660
I said pick one!

14:10.760 --> 14:13.180
- I'm not picking a fucking box!
- Did he say "fucking" on air?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.180
Are you fucking kidding?
Call fucking security!

14:15.280 --> 14:17.660
Hi, there's a guy with a gun in studio 3.

14:17.760 --> 14:19.500
It sounds like a real cute stunt today.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.420
Would you turn on the goddamn TV?
It's not a stunt this time.

14:22.520 --> 14:25.000
- I need help. Help me, help me.
- Jesus!

14:26.400 --> 14:27.860
Stupid son of a bitch.

14:27.960 --> 14:30.964
Pick a goddamn box, Lee. Come on!

14:31.800 --> 14:33.211
Come on, Lee.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.451
Do it!

14:38.280 --> 14:39.805
That's right. Open it up.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.291
Jesus Christ.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.720
Now, pick it up.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.406
Yep. Take it out.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.324
- Now put it on.
- How do I know it won't blow up?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.442
'Cause I have the detonator. All right?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.164
If my thumb comes off this trigger,
then we all explode.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.007
- What if your thumb gets tired?
- You better hope it doesn't.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.651
Now put it on.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.440
Quickly!

15:13.440 --> 15:14.980
- Okay, listen up, everybody.
- Put it on.

15:15.080 --> 15:19.244
If you're not manning a camera
or a boom, get out right now.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.980
Stop what you're doing.

15:21.080 --> 15:24.580
If you're not core-one control room,
get going.

15:24.680 --> 15:26.900
Don't look up. Just go.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.161
Right now.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.205
Button it up.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.167
Good.

15:42.640 --> 15:43.971
Sit down.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.170
Something's wrong.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.820
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe, Lee.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.380
I can't catch my breath.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.980
Just stay calm. Don't panic. You can breathe.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.100
I'm having a heart attack.

15:59.200 --> 16:01.043
- Do I look stupid to you?
- You are not having a heart attack.

16:01.640 --> 16:03.961
- Just breathe.
- I can't breathe.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.380
- Just breathe.
- Oh, God.

16:05.480 --> 16:06.700
Patty, I'm gonna fucking die.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.380
- No, you're not.
- You're not gonna die, dipshit. Not yet.

16:08.480 --> 16:11.131
- Fuck you! I'm having a fucking heart attack.
- You're not having a heart attack.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.460
- You're having a panic attack.
- How do you know?

16:12.560 --> 16:15.564
'Cause it happens to me all the time.
Here, drink some water.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.970
That's not water.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.562
Lee, I want you to hear my voice.
I'm right here.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.411
Just keep breathing.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.540
Shots have been fired at FNN

16:31.640 --> 16:33.900
- on the set of Money Monster with Lee Gates.
- Bring it here.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.020
An intruder found his way into the studio...

16:36.120 --> 16:39.681
Turn on FNN, Money Monster.
Lee Gates has been taken hostage.

16:41.320 --> 16:42.401
Shit.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.250
- Shut those doors!
- Okay. Okay.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.250
I see you.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.780
Hey! Get out of there!
Nobody goes in the booth, all right?

16:49.880 --> 16:51.420
Nobody's leaving from here on out.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.820
Anybody tries anything stupid,

16:53.920 --> 16:55.524
and I start shooting.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.808
All right? I'm in charge.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.166
You! Stay still. Stop fucking moving.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.140
I got something I wanna say.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.980
- Patty, what do you want me to do?
- Wanna make sure I get time to say it.

17:08.079 --> 17:09.127
Follow him.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
All right.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.041
I want everyone to know something.

17:29.400 --> 17:31.562
I might be the one with the gun here,

17:31.800 --> 17:34.724
but I'm not the real criminal.
It's people like these guys!

17:35.040 --> 17:38.169
They're stealing everything from us
and they're getting away with it, too.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.801
Nobody's asking how. Nobody's asking why.

17:41.240 --> 17:43.481
I didn't steal anything from you.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.889
Be quiet, Lee.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.321
You got to open your eyes out there.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.641
It's not like the government's no help.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.900
How they just look the other way,
since after they're done stealing our money,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.685
they barely even have to pay any taxes on it!

18:04.400 --> 18:07.847
I'm telling you, it's rigged.
The whole goddamn thing.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.140
They're stealing
the country out from under us.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.660
Not the Muslims. Not the Chinese. Them.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.685
- Let me ask you this...
- Shut up, Lee! Shut the fuck up!

18:17.920 --> 18:18.921
Shut up!

18:19.080 --> 18:21.620
I came here to talk! Shut up for two minutes.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.721
All right. Okay.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.444
Jesus Christ.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.884
It's all fixed.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.602
They like how the math adds up,
so they got to keep rewriting the equation.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.140
Which means, the one time you finally
get a little extra money,

18:42.240 --> 18:44.481
you try and be smart about it,
you turn on the TV.

18:46.440 --> 18:48.044
That's how they fucking take it.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.644
They take it so fast
they don't even have to explain it!

18:52.120 --> 18:53.963
They literally own the airwaves.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.966
They literally control the information.
But not today.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.484
- What does this have to do with me?
- Everything, Lee.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.700
This has everything to do
with the both of you.

19:03.800 --> 19:06.326
That's why I'm here. Don't you understand?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.370
Two boxes.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.644
Two assholes.

19:13.640 --> 19:14.620
Two?

19:14.720 --> 19:15.881
Two.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.607
You didn't just come here for me.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.571
This is about Ibis.

19:23.680 --> 19:25.980
- Goddamn right, this is about Ibis.
- Okay, I get it.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.300
Turn that camera off.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.606
Turn the camera off.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.860
You lost a lot of money.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.740
You went on TV. You said it was safe.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.444
Four weeks ago. You stood right there.

19:35.600 --> 19:38.001
This is what you did. "Let's get into this."

19:38.360 --> 19:41.300
- "Ibis! Safer than a savings account!"
- I didn't say that.

19:41.400 --> 19:45.140
"Home run after home run... Walt Camby!"

19:45.240 --> 19:47.380
- I didn't do that!
- Don't fucking lie, Lee! That's what you said.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.100
I did recommend it, but I never said
it was safer than a savings account.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.420
You want to bet? Come on, let's bet.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.740
You said it was safer
than my savings account.

19:52.840 --> 19:54.683
- I would never say it.
- Come on. Let's bet.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.580
March the 6th, it was
Stock Pick of the Millennium. March the 6th.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.260
I make a stock pick every single day.
That's a fucking joke.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.180
You got the tapes back there, right?

20:02.280 --> 20:03.220
Fuck off.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.300
Find it.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.449
- March the 6th show.
- We do five shows a week.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.561
Find them!

20:09.040 --> 20:10.371
How many people are inside?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.724
A floor manager, a sound engineer,

20:14.040 --> 20:16.281
and three cameramen on the main floor.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.820
And the director, Patty Fenn.

20:17.920 --> 20:20.820
And five tech guys
in the enclosed control room.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.780
Okay, ESU will be here momentarily.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.780
So, we're gonna need
schematics on the building.

20:24.880 --> 20:27.180
Catwalks, exits, entrances,
the whole shebang.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.281
Got it.

20:29.720 --> 20:30.926
Vasquez?

20:31.040 --> 20:34.060
If that's Semtex, it's enough
for a fireball 50-feet from center.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.924
I got a line to the control room yet?

20:36.240 --> 20:39.100
Evacuate the rest of the building.
Once it's swept, nobody in or out.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.690
Come on. Let's go.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.060
Shuttle, shuttle, shuttle.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.020
Diversify, diversify, diversify.

20:44.120 --> 20:46.282
Freeze. There it is. Okay, we've got it.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.649
- Roll it, Jim.
- Rolling.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.402
There it is! That's it.
Let's settle this right now.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.620
The name is Lee Gates.
The show is Money Monster.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.540
The day is Friday, March 6th.
Let's get right to it.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.580
It's the Stock Tip of the Millennium!

21:08.680 --> 21:11.968
Let's see what old
lucky one-arm has for us today.

21:16.680 --> 21:17.900
Ibis Clear Capital.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.526
I know, I've talked this one up before,
but what can I tell you?

21:21.040 --> 21:22.485
I'm in love.

21:22.680 --> 21:28.100
This is Ibis's stock
since it went public 11 months ago.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.568
Look at those curves. So voluptuous.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.529
So full-figured!

21:33.720 --> 21:35.324
I'm genuinely attracted to it.

21:35.480 --> 21:36.700
Not sexually so much,

21:36.800 --> 21:40.060
although after half a dozen vodka tonics I
could talk myself into pretty much anything.

21:40.160 --> 21:44.529
No. I am in love with this intellectually.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.420
Because Ibis is run
by a man named Walt Camby.

21:49.520 --> 21:52.420
Walt was one of the first guys
to tap into the true market potential

21:52.520 --> 21:55.100
of high-frequency trading.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.060
Look at this.
Home run after home run after home run.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.820
And now he has finally gone public.

22:00.920 --> 22:04.820
Folks, there isn't a better bet out there.
Not bonds, not IRAs,

22:04.920 --> 22:06.300
not your savings account.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.721
None of them are as safe as Walt Camby.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.365
Cut it, Jim.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.700
Patty, put the numbers back up there.
Give me another fix.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.660
Come on.
Oh, my God, I'm going weak in the knees.

22:14.760 --> 22:16.762
- I was exaggerating to make a point.
- You lost a bet, Lee.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.860
I made a bad call.
How much are you into Ibis for?

22:19.960 --> 22:21.291
Sixty grand.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.820
Sixty grand? This is about sixty grand?

22:23.920 --> 22:25.700
Pocket change to you, right?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.484
Yeah, it kind of is. Okay, look.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.500
You give me five minutes,
and I can get you 60 grand in cash here,

22:30.600 --> 22:31.620
and I can make you whole.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.961
- That won't make me whole.
- All right. What's a number that will?

22:34.600 --> 22:36.284
$800 million.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.500
It's gonna take me a little longer
to get $800 million here, pal.

22:39.600 --> 22:42.500
That's how much went
fucking poof into thin air, you dumb shit.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.580
So that's what you owe us. 'Cause I'm not
the only one watching your show.

22:45.680 --> 22:47.700
I'm not the only shareholder
who got screwed over here.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.020
You're the only shareholder here with a gun.

22:49.120 --> 22:52.620
You think you're fucking funny, Lee?
Is this funny to you?

22:52.720 --> 22:54.085
Lee, don't provoke him.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.643
You must think I'm so stupid.

22:58.480 --> 23:00.687
Trying to fucking buy me off.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.130
I'm not stupid, Lee.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.483
I walked in here knowing there was only
one way this show was gonna end.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.564
I came in here knowing I'm not walking out.

23:18.280 --> 23:19.520
Sit down.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.300
Sit down.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.740
Where the hell is ESU?
And where's my negotiator?

23:29.840 --> 23:31.444
Negotiator's two minutes out.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.740
- Patty Fenn.
- This is Captain Marcus Powell.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.780
The network confirmed
you can stay live on the air.

23:36.880 --> 23:37.860
Just keep stalling him.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.060
What do you mean "keep stalling"?

23:39.160 --> 23:42.220
Tell him to say whatever it is this guy
wants to hear until we put a plan in place,

23:42.320 --> 23:43.940
whatever it takes to keep him
from setting off that bomb.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.060
Jesus.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.207
Fuck off.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.682
Lee? You have to keep stalling.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.740
Just keep talking to him.

23:50.840 --> 23:54.526
You're good at that. So just keep talking.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.485
Talk.

24:05.320 --> 24:11.202
Listen, I get it. What happened at Ibis is...
It's a disaster, there's no other word for it.

24:15.040 --> 24:17.540
I can promise you that Walt Camby

24:17.640 --> 24:20.371
is as sick about this as anybody else.

24:20.520 --> 24:23.649
Yeah? Is that what he told you
from his private fucking jet?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.207
Listen, if anybody is gonna
bounce back from it,

24:35.400 --> 24:38.420
it's Walt and Ibis.
This was an isolated incident.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.851
- What's this?
- It's completely unrelated...

24:40.200 --> 24:41.884
What is this? Who wrote this?

24:42.360 --> 24:44.169
- Somebody from my office.
- "Diane Lester."

24:46.560 --> 24:49.860
You see? This is what I'm talking about.
That's your problem.

24:49.960 --> 24:52.380
You just sit there
behind their little fucking desk,

24:52.480 --> 24:54.980
like their little fucking puppet,
buying into their bullshit,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.140
instead of trying to figure out
what really happened.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.100
You know what happened.
It was a computer glitch.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.980
A glitch! A glitch!
It was a fucking glitch! A glitch!

25:03.080 --> 25:04.320
Shut up about the glitch!

25:05.040 --> 25:06.041
All right?

25:06.240 --> 25:08.004
What the hell does that even mean?

25:09.880 --> 25:12.884
You see, you don't even know.
I'm not stupid, Lee. I told you.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.860
People just at home accepting this shit,
they're the stupid ones,

25:15.960 --> 25:17.500
because somehow these clowns

25:17.600 --> 25:20.340
lost $800 million overnight.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.965
Overnight.

25:22.080 --> 25:24.560
And nobody's even actually explained how.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.565
How is something like that even possible?

25:27.920 --> 25:29.445
How is that even fair?

25:31.920 --> 25:33.251
How's that fair?

25:34.120 --> 25:36.407
It's not a rhetorical question.
I want a fucking answer.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.700
What do you want from me, man?

25:37.800 --> 25:40.020
I don't run Ibis. I'm just a guy on TV.

25:40.120 --> 25:42.980
No, no. Do not do that, Lee. Do not do that.

25:43.080 --> 25:44.809
You don't get to pass the buck today, Lee.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.728
Not today. Not with me.

25:50.600 --> 25:52.380
So, what do we know about him so far?

25:52.480 --> 25:55.643
Name's Kyle Budwell.
No wants, no warrants, no priors.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.860
We sent a patrol to his residence
to locate family.

25:57.960 --> 25:59.883
They won't find anyone. The guy's a loner.

26:00.440 --> 26:04.340
Hundred bucks says this poor shithead
either lives by himself or with his mother.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.380
The real losers tend to stay home
with their mommies.

26:06.480 --> 26:10.326
But, hey, do your thing.
But watch and see, the guy's a loner.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.500
Yes?

26:12.600 --> 26:16.300
Can you patch this line directly into
the studio PA system for us, please, Patty?

26:16.400 --> 26:18.562
- We have a negotiator here.
- Okay.

26:18.680 --> 26:22.002
Charlie? Patch this line
into the PA system, please. Right now.

26:22.880 --> 26:26.060
It's all about...
It's high-frequency trading. It can...

26:26.160 --> 26:28.003
Let us know when we're on.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.170
Can he hear me?

26:30.680 --> 26:34.060
This is Oscar Nelson.
I'm a veteran negotiator with the NYPD.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.128
No. I don't want to talk to no cops.

26:36.240 --> 26:37.860
Don't think of me as a cop.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.564
Hey, what'd I just say? No cops!

26:40.680 --> 26:42.500
Cut the line! Cut it.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.620
I can handle it myself.

26:43.720 --> 26:44.700
Anybody comes on that mike,

26:44.800 --> 26:45.926
you gonna put a bullet in his head.
You hear me?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.220
- Cut the line. Cut it.
- Cut the line, Charlie. Right now.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.209
Do not cut this...

26:50.840 --> 26:54.540
Two people I came here to talk to.
Him and Walt fucking Camby.

26:54.640 --> 26:57.220
All right, well, then let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.060
All right, so let's get him
Walt fucking Camby already.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.100
Right. Exactly. Throw him under the bus.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.220
Look, he was supposed to be here today.
He didn't show up.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.940
It's his company. It's his crash.
So let's see what he has to say.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.041
Right. Yes.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.620
- What happened to the Ibis feed?
- I have no idea.

27:14.720 --> 27:15.820
God damn it.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.980
All right, find me Bree.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.460
Have her call Diane Lester
back on the phone.

27:18.560 --> 27:19.900
I want her back up on that screen.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.100
And find out everything and anything
you can about Ibis Clear Capital.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.620
- Got it.
- Yes, what is it?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.100
I want the PA system available
in case we need to speak to him again.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.460
Right.
Because it worked so well the first time.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.380
Look, just make sure you answer this phone.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.006
We'll be right downstairs
exploring means of extraction.

27:45.880 --> 27:48.201
I have Patty Fenn from Money Monster
on line three.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.300
Marta, when is he landing?

27:50.400 --> 27:53.140
I don't even know which plane he's on,
so I've no way of tracking him.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.500
He took the G-V to Geneva on Tuesday,

27:55.600 --> 27:58.080
but then he sent that to Hong Kong
to pick up Harvey Bergan.

27:58.280 --> 28:02.126
Last location I have for the Learjet
was Sao Paulo on Monday.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.660
Monday? That's four days ago.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.660
You know how he is with his planes.
When he's in the air, he's off the grid.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.780
Are you telling me that until he lands,
whenever the hell that may be, that he's...

28:10.880 --> 28:14.500
He's completely unreachable.
Which makes this one big clusterfuck.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.820
I have Patty Fenn on hold.
What should I tell her?

28:16.920 --> 28:17.921
She'll call back.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.287
Come on.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.180
Diane Lester's office
is giving me the runaround.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.220
Okay, Bree.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.620
Dave, I need an address for Ibis, ASAP.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.180
And, Bree, try Dan Issa at the SEC.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.620
They've got to be
sniffing around this train wreck already.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.500
Keep stalling, Lee. We're on it.

28:32.600 --> 28:36.700
Lenny, can you come around on this guy?
I'm losing him in a little shadow.

28:36.800 --> 28:39.201
- You kidding me?
- Just move in.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.485
What the hell are you doing?

28:45.800 --> 28:47.900
Director wanted a better angle on your face.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.161
There's kind of a...

28:50.080 --> 28:51.320
A little shadow.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.121
"A little shadow"?

28:53.640 --> 28:55.085
Patty, "A little shadow"?

28:56.320 --> 28:58.620
He could have killed you
much easier off camera, Lee.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.900
There's a reason
he's interrupted you on live TV.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.220
Look, give me a break, guy.
I'm just trying to do my job.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.163
They tell me to move in, I move in.

29:07.480 --> 29:09.323
All right, where do you want to go?

29:09.680 --> 29:11.140
Well, if you went over there,
it would be good.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.740
- Here?
- Yeah.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.700
See, I'm directing a show back here,
which means you're hosting one up there.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.802
So start hosting.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.961
Okay, first things first.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.780
- What's your name?
- Don't worry about my name.

29:27.880 --> 29:28.860
You're on TV. Trust me.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.930
They're gonna know your Little League
batting average by the time this is through.

29:32.040 --> 29:35.020
His name is Kyle Budwell.
The cops already tracked down his info.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.249
Doesn't even have to be your real name.
Just give me anything I can call you.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.363
Fine. Call me Kyle.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.884
Okay, Kyle.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.726
Got the address.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.620
All right, that's midtown.
Listen, Ibis is ducking our calls.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.580
I say we send somebody there
in person instead.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.140
- All right.
- Alan, see if you can put a mike on this guy.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.700
Lee, talk him through this.
I don't want him spooked.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.540
- Kyle, listen.
- Yeah.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.380
This is Alan. He's our sound guy.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.404
He wants to put a microphone on you,
so you can... No, it's okay. It's okay.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.563
You want people
to be able to hear you, right?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.740
- Why, they couldn't hear me before?
- They could... This will be better.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.620
We're tracking down Ron now.
I'm gonna put him on the air with you.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.780
- Kyle.
- Yeah?

30:16.880 --> 30:19.140
I'm gonna send one of my guys
over to Ibis's office

30:19.240 --> 30:21.447
and see if they can
get some answers in person.

30:21.920 --> 30:24.491
We've got a producer.
This kid's name is Ron.

30:25.160 --> 30:26.844
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.380
- Christ!
- Oh, my God!

30:29.480 --> 30:31.340
Ron! This stuff really works!

30:31.440 --> 30:33.860
- What's the stock trading at?
- $4.25.

30:33.960 --> 30:34.961
Christ!

30:35.840 --> 30:37.620
Shit, shit, shit. Shit. My phone.

30:37.720 --> 30:41.020
- No, it's okay. I need a break, anyway.
- Hold on.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.485
- Yeah?
- Hang on, Ron.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.246
Hey, Charlie.

30:44.360 --> 30:46.220
Hi, Ron.
I'm gonna put you on the air with Lee.

30:46.320 --> 30:48.460
Lee, you've got Ron. Patching Ron in.

30:48.560 --> 30:49.580
What do you mean
you're putting me on the air?

30:49.680 --> 30:50.660
You're going on the air?

30:50.760 --> 30:52.842
Who is that? Where are you?

30:53.240 --> 30:56.289
I'm in my office with Arlene.

30:56.520 --> 30:57.851
Who'd you just tell my name to?

30:58.240 --> 30:59.765
Is that Arlene from Product Placement?

31:00.080 --> 31:01.260
Get off my jeans.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.044
I thought you said the building was cleared.

31:03.440 --> 31:04.885
It was. We walked every floor.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.645
So, what's up, Lee?

31:08.120 --> 31:09.500
Hey, are you coming back?

31:09.600 --> 31:10.900
Where are you right now?

31:11.000 --> 31:14.020
I've just been going through tapes
for tomorrow,

31:14.120 --> 31:17.580
but everything looks good,
so I think we should be in good shape, so...

31:17.680 --> 31:19.842
Holy shit! That guy has a gun!

31:20.120 --> 31:21.406
Imagine my surprise.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.020
Now, do us a favor and get your ass
down to Ibis Clear Capital,

31:25.120 --> 31:26.326
would you, please?

31:26.560 --> 31:27.540
Okay.

31:27.640 --> 31:28.900
I like when he has the strippers on.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.001
Right. Right. Sure.

31:30.320 --> 31:32.380
- Don't be a schmuck, Ron. Get moving.
- Is this for real?

31:32.480 --> 31:33.780
Hey, turn it up, will you?

31:33.880 --> 31:35.260
There's a van and a crew
waiting downstairs for you.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.761
Let's go. Come on. Move.
You should be downstairs already. Let's go!

32:38.360 --> 32:39.725
What's taking them so long?

32:40.040 --> 32:42.042
It's midday traffic. What are you gonna do?

32:42.200 --> 32:43.531
Got it.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.283
So the home address is outdated.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.460
The family that's in there now
bought it six months ago

32:48.560 --> 32:52.770
from the estate of one Clara Budwell,
a 62-years-old deceased woman.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.380
Mama's boy. What'd I tell you?

32:54.480 --> 32:55.700
We tracked down the escrow company.

32:55.800 --> 32:58.700
They confirmed all the money from the sale
went to her son. Guess how much?

32:58.800 --> 32:59.780
Sixty grand.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.980
It's a good thing you didn't bet me, pal,
since he fits the profile to a fucking T.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.700
There has to be a current address
with the escrow company.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.801
Somewhere they sent the check to.

33:05.920 --> 33:07.763
- There is, but we need a subpoena to get it.
- Captain.

33:07.880 --> 33:09.620
Get somebody down to the courthouse, ASAP.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.643
Judge Reiner. He'll expedite.

33:11.760 --> 33:12.761
All right.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.300
We can try to gain access
through catwalks here

33:15.400 --> 33:19.020
or a crawlspace here, and get them out
through the hatch in the control room here.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.090
First, we save the hostages.
Second, we take out the psycho.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.844
Okay, we're here.
Just give us a minute to get set up.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.980
- We've got Ron. I'm putting him up.
- Okay, here we go.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.540
We've got Ron Sprecher
reporting from outside...

33:30.640 --> 33:32.500
As if this month couldn't get any worse.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.660
Ron, Ron, can you hear us?

33:33.760 --> 33:36.700
I'm here outside Ibis Clear Capital,
where their CEO...

33:36.800 --> 33:39.380
Security, there's a man down there
with a camera crew.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.740
Make sure he doesn't get in the building
under any circumstances.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.365
What did Teterboro say, Marta?

33:43.600 --> 33:46.300
I gave them the tail numbers
of both of these planes,

33:46.400 --> 33:47.845
no communication with either.

33:48.480 --> 33:51.420
Okay, I'm gonna down there
and try and buy us some time.

33:51.520 --> 33:53.460
I mean, obviously,
this guy just wants some answers.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.500
So do we.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.900
If we knew how we lost $800 million,
we wouldn't have lost $800 million.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.401
I get that, Avery,
but we still have to say something.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.300
Come on. You know Walt. He's an open book.
I know if he was here...

34:03.400 --> 34:05.500
But he's not here, Diane. He's not here.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.980
Okay, we can't just lock ourselves away here
and do nothing and hope it disappears.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.286
We are a publicly-traded company.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.340
We've got shareholders.
We've got a board of directors

34:12.440 --> 34:15.808
and we've got a CEO, even though
we don't know where he is right now.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.699
So, look,
I'm happy to have this conversation again

34:17.800 --> 34:20.804
when Walt lands,
but until then, it's not our call to make.

34:27.360 --> 34:32.139
So, he's got the stage all locked up.
These are the exits, front and rear.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.380
Now, the problem is,

34:33.480 --> 34:36.380
this guy's got complete range of vision
throughout the entire studio.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.060
So our only chance for a clean shot

34:39.159 --> 34:40.860
is from these catwalks above the stage.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.900
We're putting a man in position there
as we speak.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.060
What about the bomb?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.400
This is definitely a dead man's switch
here in his hand,

34:46.520 --> 34:48.966
which means, if you take him out
without disarming the bomb first...

34:50.000 --> 34:52.139
Got the warrant, got an address.
Sending a patrol there now.

34:52.239 --> 34:53.241
Great.

34:53.360 --> 34:55.580
You see this bulge right here?
That's the wireless receiver.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.060
Now, Captain, if we can destroy that,

34:57.160 --> 34:59.527
then the dead man's switch
is just another fucking switch.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.604
Except, in order to destroy it,
we got to what, shoot Gates?

35:02.840 --> 35:04.365
That's where this guy slipped up.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.740
If he wanted to ensure a kill shot,

35:05.840 --> 35:08.940
he should've put the receiver here,
right over the poor bastard's heart.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.361
But instead, he put it down here
next to his left kidney.

35:11.880 --> 35:15.420
If the bullet's on target, we get to him
quick enough to avoid too much blood loss,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.260
there's a good chance, Captain,
he could survive it.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.460
I'm sorry.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.860
Are you proposing
we shoot the star of a TV show

35:20.960 --> 35:23.440
live, on air, in front of millions of people?

35:24.520 --> 35:25.780
Yeah.

35:25.880 --> 35:28.300
I need you to talk to somebody
from Ibis Clear Capital.

35:28.400 --> 35:29.820
I need to talk... You wanna touch me?

35:29.920 --> 35:32.220
- Don't put your hands on me.
- Andre? It's okay.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.940
- That's, that's...
- Diane Lester. I'll be happy to talk to you.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.620
Do you have an earpiece
so I can hear everyone?

35:36.720 --> 35:37.780
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay, good.

35:37.880 --> 35:38.980
- Come on.
- All right.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.660
We're gonna talk to Diane Lester.
She's the PR lady. She's the...

35:42.760 --> 35:43.740
CCO.

35:43.840 --> 35:46.780
...Chief Communications Officer at Ibis.
Diane?

35:46.880 --> 35:50.020
Okay, get ready to put her on screen two.
We're gonna put her on screen two.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.180
We're ready when you are.

35:51.280 --> 35:52.611
And go, Jim.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.530
- Here she comes.
- All right.

35:55.440 --> 35:58.020
First, let me start off by saying

35:58.120 --> 36:00.740
on behalf of everyone here at Ibis,

36:00.840 --> 36:04.700
we are prepared to do whatever we can
to get you to put down that gun, Mr. Budwell.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.580
Now, I understand that
you've offered to compensate him

36:06.680 --> 36:08.409
for his losses personally, Lee.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.241
Well, we are absolutely willing to do
the same if it helps put an end to all this.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.860
All right, you walk away now,
double your money.

36:15.960 --> 36:17.485
She knows my last name.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.646
Everybody in the five boroughs
knows your last name by now, Kyle.

36:23.680 --> 36:25.540
No, it's too late for your money, lady.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.460
All I want from you is an answer.
I just wanna know what really happened?

36:28.560 --> 36:30.801
Goddamn it!

36:31.160 --> 36:32.810
Well, the truth is

36:34.480 --> 36:36.180
we don't know.

36:36.280 --> 36:39.250
We don't know why the algo
suddenly went haywire.

36:39.960 --> 36:43.300
And we don't know why the fail-safes
built to prevent...

36:43.400 --> 36:46.006
God, I really hope she has more to say
than "We don't know."

36:47.280 --> 36:48.820
We just don't know.

36:48.920 --> 36:51.740
Are you kidding?
This is all she's got? Are you kidding me?

36:51.840 --> 36:53.444
Sacajawea.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.180
Fine.

36:56.280 --> 36:59.204
Are you watching this?
This is getting out of control.

36:59.320 --> 37:01.780
The amount of scrutiny we're gonna get
after this idiot blows himself up

37:01.880 --> 37:03.700
is going to be unbelievable.

37:03.800 --> 37:06.620
You thought it was bad before?
It's about to get 100 times more intense.

37:06.720 --> 37:10.220
Look, don't worry, okay? We can handle it.
Gates is an idiot.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.210
Just stay the course, okay?
I'm working Mambo night and day.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.689
I would like to point out
that this affected all of us.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.020
All our board, our managers,
including myself.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.860
Our pensions were depleted overnight.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.420
- Diane.
- Our savings gutted just like yours.

37:25.520 --> 37:26.740
Wait. Wait. I'm sorry.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.220
Are you trying to make me feel sorry for you?

37:28.320 --> 37:30.380
Is that really what's happening right now?

37:30.480 --> 37:32.260
- No, I just...
- That's exactly what's happening.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.771
I understand you want specifics.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.540
Yeah. So why doesn't
she give him some specifics?

37:36.640 --> 37:39.100
We know this was
a completely isolated incident.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.850
It's what we call a black swan.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.131
It's impossible to predict,
but it's impossible to replicate.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.780
"Black swan"?

37:45.880 --> 37:46.940
That's her memo.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.610
She's reading from her memo.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.740
Diane. Diane.
We both read your talking points.

37:51.840 --> 37:55.460
He doesn't want some PR spin about
what's gonna go right next year.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.420
He wants an explanation
for what went wrong last week.

37:58.520 --> 37:59.521
Yeah.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.300
Right, I understand.
And we believe in complete transparency.

38:03.400 --> 38:04.820
That's why we disclosed...

38:04.920 --> 38:06.820
Where are your quants, Diane?
Where are your quants?

38:06.920 --> 38:10.100
- That's good. Go with that. Get an answer.
- I'm sorry?

38:10.200 --> 38:11.260
- Yeah.
- The quants you used.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.980
The guy who actually designed
the algorithm that crashed.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.900
Where is he? Is he in that
building right there behind you?

38:17.000 --> 38:18.700
'Cause I think
I'd like to ask him a few questions.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.460
No, these are our administrative offices.
Our quants aren't...

38:21.560 --> 38:23.660
Okay, then where is he? Is he in Mumbai?

38:23.760 --> 38:25.940
Russia? Yeah, he's in Russia.
They're all in Russia.

38:26.040 --> 38:26.980
I'm not sure.

38:27.080 --> 38:29.260
But if you'd like to talk to someone,
then I can make that happen.

38:29.360 --> 38:32.540
No, I don't want to talk to
some low-level schlub, God damn it.

38:32.640 --> 38:34.300
I want an explanation from you!

38:34.400 --> 38:37.540
And if you can't give me one,
then I want to talk to Walt Camby.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.801
No, I'm sorry,

38:38.920 --> 38:40.331
- but Walt is on a plane right now.
- God damn...

38:42.560 --> 38:44.460
Shit-fucking assholes.

38:44.560 --> 38:48.180
I'm getting so tired of this same old
bullshit over and over again, Lee.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.940
- Wait.
- Don't tell me to wait!

38:50.040 --> 38:50.980
What happened?

38:51.080 --> 38:53.020
He just shot out your monitor on the stage

38:53.120 --> 38:55.580
because you're giving him
the same corporate bullshit!

38:55.680 --> 38:56.820
I'm not.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.020
You have to understand
how delicate of a situation this is.

38:59.120 --> 39:02.580
I'm sitting 80-feet from a bomb!
Don't talk to me about delicate situations!

39:02.680 --> 39:05.160
You have got to wake up
and do the math here,

39:05.280 --> 39:07.123
because it is not adding up to me, either.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.765
Why is that so goddamn hard?

39:09.680 --> 39:10.980
Sorry, what do you mean?

39:11.080 --> 39:13.820
I mean, you better ask some real questions

39:13.920 --> 39:16.020
and get some real answers,
and hurry the fuck up!

39:16.120 --> 39:17.620
I want what happened to make sense!

39:17.720 --> 39:20.740
Do not talk to him like that.
Do not tell him things.

39:20.840 --> 39:22.980
- Right now!
- Don't do anything stupid.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.100
Let me get you some answers.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.900
You need to bargain for more time. All right?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.140
- Trade something.
- Give me 10 more minutes.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.820
Bargain with him.

39:28.920 --> 39:30.604
Kyle, look.

39:30.720 --> 39:33.803
You give me something,
I give you something. Okay?

39:34.120 --> 39:35.246
That's how this works.

39:37.400 --> 39:39.687
You do something for me,
I do something for you.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.331
Come on.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.924
Give me a chance.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.489
Let me figure this out.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.128
- Fine, you got 10 minutes.
- Okay. All right.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.167
Now what?

40:17.600 --> 40:20.763
I made myself extraordinarily clear
that you were not to go on camera.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.420
I am curious.
Who actually did design that algo?

40:23.520 --> 40:24.980
Why don't we call him together?

40:25.080 --> 40:27.020
Now, you listen to me, Diane. You're a CCO.

40:27.120 --> 40:29.340
And that is all you are and that is nothing.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.660
I've seen a dozen girls like you come and go.

40:30.760 --> 40:31.820
- Really? Girls like me?
- Yeah!

40:31.920 --> 40:32.980
I don't have to stand here
and listen to this.

40:33.080 --> 40:36.260
- Well, you're fired, Diane!
- You can't fire me. I don't report to you.

40:36.360 --> 40:39.443
It's not our job to bail out this psychopath!
Do not walk away from me!

40:39.600 --> 40:41.284
I don't report to you, Avery.

40:41.520 --> 40:45.500
Ryan, get me a list of every quant that's
been on our payroll since we went public.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.500
Walt's G-V radioed Teterboro.
Twenty minutes out.

40:48.600 --> 40:51.570
Have a car waiting downstairs for me.
And get me that list.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.888
This is Eagle One in first position.
Proceeding to two.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.380
Bree, I asked for Dan Issa from the SEC.

41:11.480 --> 41:13.540
I called twice and left word both times.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.641
All right, get me Ron.

41:15.480 --> 41:19.060
Ron, I need you to go down
to the SEC's offices on Vesey Street.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.700
Find Dan Issa. Do not take no for an answer.
You have nine minutes.

41:21.800 --> 41:22.780
Nine minutes?

41:22.880 --> 41:25.724
- Vesey Street's over a mile away.
- Then you better start running now.

41:26.320 --> 41:29.540
Hey, Dave, can you pull up a stock
price graphic for Ibis for me, please?

41:29.640 --> 41:33.140
- Okay. I'll need a second.
- Okay, then put their logo up on the nine-by.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.287
Okay.

41:35.160 --> 41:39.740
Lee? How many people do you think
are tuned into us right now at this moment?

41:39.840 --> 41:42.660
Millions probably? Tens of millions?

41:42.760 --> 41:45.820
That's tens of millions of investors,

41:45.920 --> 41:49.129
all with their fingers
on their E-trade accounts.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.700
Kyle, you bought Ibis at what, $75 a share?

41:52.800 --> 41:56.122
- Yeah. So?
- What if we can get it back there?

41:56.840 --> 41:59.684
How many times I gotta tell you,
it's too late for your money.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.045
You're not the only shareholder
that got screwed over.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.740
You came here because you had something
that you wanted to say.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.340
You want people
to finally listen to you, right?

42:09.440 --> 42:10.441
Yeah.

42:10.560 --> 42:12.180
Well, now they can.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.601
- Logo's ready.
- Put it up on the big screen.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.940
All right, Lee. Go to work.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.122
Watch what we can do.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.220
I want to talk to everybody out there.

42:21.320 --> 42:23.620
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.780
And here's what I want you to do.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.700
I want you to go to your computer

42:27.800 --> 42:30.940
and I want you to buy Ibis stock.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.620
I'm gonna be upfront with you.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.620
I don't want you to do it
because you're gonna make money.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.290
I want you to do it

42:37.040 --> 42:38.883
because it'll save my life.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.325
This is ballsy.

42:42.080 --> 42:43.300
The old Money Monster bump.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.620
The old Money Monster bump
on a massive scale.

42:45.720 --> 42:47.300
- Where's my stock price?
- Just got it up.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.700
It's simple math. Value comes from demand.

42:49.800 --> 42:52.900
So if every single one of you
buys a few shares,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.820
then we can get the price
of this sucker up in no time.

42:54.920 --> 42:56.649
And here's the crazy part.

42:56.760 --> 42:59.380
If we do it and everybody invests
just a little bit of money,

42:59.480 --> 43:01.660
the price starts to go up.

43:01.760 --> 43:05.940
And then the algorithms... They start to
take notice, and they start to buy it.

43:06.040 --> 43:07.220
Give it to me on the big screen.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.260
If you can fool them,
then the sky's the limit!

43:09.360 --> 43:13.140
Which means that together we can turn
a bad investment into a good one

43:13.240 --> 43:16.340
by sheer force of will.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.660
Nice.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.580
So, as of right now,

43:19.680 --> 43:23.620
I am moving Ibis from a sell to a buy.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.660
He's gonna call a triple.
Ready triple. Roll it.

43:26.760 --> 43:27.841
...and make it a rare...

43:29.240 --> 43:31.242
...Triple Buy!

43:37.280 --> 43:40.045
Come on. Come on.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.647
Come on, you son of a bitch.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.300
Come on, guys.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.926
We're human beings, we're not computers.

43:58.480 --> 44:00.300
We have a conscience.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.180
Refresh, refresh.

44:02.280 --> 44:03.780
- There it is.
- Yeah.

44:03.880 --> 44:05.803
$8.48.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.041
Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

44:09.160 --> 44:10.380
We take care of each other.

44:10.480 --> 44:11.766
It's embedded in our DNA.

44:11.880 --> 44:17.887
Not because an equation tells us to,
but because we feel it in here.

44:18.800 --> 44:21.167
And right now, I need your help.

44:21.720 --> 44:23.100
This looks promising.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.531
We can do the right thing.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.860
But we have to do it together.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.928
Come on. Refresh, refresh.

44:35.520 --> 44:36.540
So, I'm talking to every one of you.

44:36.640 --> 44:40.008
Every single person
that's watching me right now.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.900
I want you to dig as deep as you can

44:43.000 --> 44:46.891
and I want you to ask yourself,
what is a life worth to you?

44:53.640 --> 44:55.404
What's my life worth?

45:20.760 --> 45:23.366
I guess that answers that question, huh?

45:32.280 --> 45:34.362
Detective, one coming in.

45:43.480 --> 45:45.180
Ma'am. Excuse me.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.620
Ma'am. NYPD. You live here?

45:47.720 --> 45:49.220
Yeah. What's the problem?

45:49.320 --> 45:51.368
What's your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

45:52.040 --> 45:53.690
Why? Where is he?

45:54.280 --> 45:56.100
Where have you been all day?
If you don't mind me asking.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.580
I work in a glass box underground
for eight hours a day.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.700
So could you please just tell me
what the hell is going on here,

46:00.800 --> 46:02.060
because you're really
starting to freak me out.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.420
I'm gonna ask again.

46:03.520 --> 46:05.921
What is your relationship
to Kyle Budwell, ma'am?

46:09.280 --> 46:11.282
Why don't you take a wild guess.

46:15.280 --> 46:16.327
Powell.

46:17.240 --> 46:19.242
Okay, I'll clear a path.

46:19.800 --> 46:22.406
I should've taken that bet after all,
you sack of shit.

46:29.160 --> 46:31.447
This is really impressive, Lee.

46:32.320 --> 46:34.527
I mean, talk about market influence.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.728
Do you want to know
why that shit didn't work, asshole?

46:41.920 --> 46:45.060
Because even you don't buy
your own bullshit.

46:45.160 --> 46:48.528
You believe in money.
You don't believe in people.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.047
Lee, they tracked down his girlfriend.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.620
They don't believe in you, either.

46:53.720 --> 46:55.420
His pregnant girlfriend.

46:55.520 --> 46:58.603
- You got to be fucking joking.
- No, no joke, Lee.

47:00.120 --> 47:01.140
Quant.

47:01.240 --> 47:03.460
Quantitative analytics.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.642
Look, I have no idea
what you're saying right now.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.649
Does anybody there speak English?

47:11.320 --> 47:12.300
Fuck.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.900
I need the other number
for the guy in Moscow.

47:14.000 --> 47:17.004
Yeah, but he gave me another name.
This one's based out of Seoul.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.846
God damn it. Goodloe.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.521
- Shit.
- I've got it.

47:34.160 --> 47:36.811
Go get me a phone number.
I'm gonna find a translator.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.460
Amy! Amy! Amy!

47:46.560 --> 47:49.404
Bring your security pass and come with me.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.410
Hurts, doesn't it?

47:56.400 --> 47:58.767
Got your fancy education.

47:59.080 --> 48:01.606
Got your millions in the bank.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.809
Think you got it all made.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.084
You're not such a hot shit right now, huh?

48:11.680 --> 48:15.162
You want to sit here
and take stock of our lives, Kyle?

48:16.000 --> 48:18.128
How about we compare scores?

48:18.520 --> 48:19.780
How about we do that?

48:19.880 --> 48:22.247
Touchscreen. Shit, the touchscreen.

48:24.760 --> 48:28.207
All right. We got Kyle and we got Lee.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.060
Let's start with the obvious. Money.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.003
I got some. You don't, I gather.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.770
So, that's a point for me.

48:37.440 --> 48:38.487
Where you going with this, Lee?

48:38.600 --> 48:40.620
But then there's family.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.200
I'm divorced three times.
What about you? You got a wife?

48:44.840 --> 48:45.940
Girlfriend, then?

48:46.040 --> 48:47.201
Sacajawea, Lee.

48:47.320 --> 48:51.120
You got a girlfriend? That's nice.
The magic of young love.

48:51.240 --> 48:52.940
I think we can both agree
that's a point for you,

48:53.040 --> 48:56.540
since the first number on my speed-dial
is an escort service.

48:56.640 --> 48:59.180
- You don't know anything about me.
- I don't need to know about you!

48:59.280 --> 49:02.580
I know about me.
Seven years, three years, 14 months.

49:02.680 --> 49:04.540
The marriages, they get shorter
and they get shorter,

49:04.640 --> 49:06.802
but settlements, they get larger and larger.

49:06.920 --> 49:07.940
Lee?

49:08.040 --> 49:09.610
Look at me, Lee.

49:10.680 --> 49:12.284
Sacajawea.

49:13.120 --> 49:15.780
Hey, Kyle, you see her?

49:15.880 --> 49:19.726
That's Patty, my director,
and she wants me to shut up.

49:20.880 --> 49:22.700
Well, now, she's sick of me, too.

49:22.800 --> 49:27.044
And that's why she took a job
across the street and didn't tell me.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.325
People talk.

49:32.920 --> 49:35.740
They all leave sooner or later, Kyle.
That's just how it works.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.684
So trust me, that's gonna be a point for you.

49:40.680 --> 49:41.806
What about kids?

49:42.920 --> 49:44.331
You got a kid?

49:46.200 --> 49:48.089
One on the way, maybe?

49:49.080 --> 49:51.780
Yeah? She's expecting. It's a blessing.

49:51.880 --> 49:54.020
I have one myself.

49:54.120 --> 49:58.340
She must be six or seven. I have no idea.

49:58.440 --> 49:59.965
I send a check.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.860
Mazel tov on the bundle of joy.

50:02.960 --> 50:05.660
I think we can both agree
that's another fucking point for you.

50:05.760 --> 50:07.220
So, now, look at this.

50:07.320 --> 50:10.460
Kyle. Oh, my God.
We just got started and you're already ahead.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.380
Just... Just stay wide, Jim.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.767
So let me ask you something, Kyle.

50:15.400 --> 50:18.380
What about your life is so much shittier
than the rest of ours

50:18.480 --> 50:20.528
that you get to throw in the towel early?

50:21.480 --> 50:22.970
I want to know.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.540
You got a decent job.
You got two hands and two feet.

50:25.640 --> 50:27.768
You got a goddamn kid on the way!

50:28.320 --> 50:32.540
So before you blow me to kingdom come,
I want you to answer one question.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.644
What makes you such a giant fucking failure
compared to everybody else?

50:35.760 --> 50:37.420
You really gonna stand there
in your $1,000 suit

50:37.520 --> 50:39.124
and compare scores with me?

50:41.160 --> 50:44.340
My honest job pays me $14 an hour,
you cocksucker.

50:44.440 --> 50:46.204
So let's start there.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.289
You know how far $14 an hour
gets you here in New York?

50:51.160 --> 50:54.926
You know how much of that is left
after I pay my rent and all my fucking bills?

50:56.120 --> 50:58.900
I keep paddling as hard as I can
just to stay above water.

50:59.000 --> 51:00.260
It takes everything I got!

51:00.360 --> 51:01.860
And that's before the kid gets here.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.460
How the hell am I gonna supposed to
support him?

51:03.560 --> 51:04.660
How am I gonna take care of him?

51:04.760 --> 51:05.740
You'll take great care of him.

51:05.840 --> 51:09.180
He gets to grow up being the kid
whose old man blew himself up on live TV.

51:09.280 --> 51:10.940
- God damn it, Lee.
- He's the goddamn Father of the Year!

51:11.040 --> 51:12.980
Don't you fucking say
another word about my son

51:13.080 --> 51:15.220
or I'll end this right fucking now.
You hear me?

51:15.320 --> 51:16.820
- All right.
- You hear me?

51:16.920 --> 51:19.380
You want your brains splattered
all over downtown, Lee, huh?

51:19.480 --> 51:20.970
Mr. Budwell!

51:22.160 --> 51:23.525
Mr. Budwell.

51:26.520 --> 51:27.760
Yeah?

51:29.360 --> 51:31.169
Mr. Budwell, please stand by.

51:33.760 --> 51:34.841
Stand by for what?

51:35.880 --> 51:37.405
Stand by for what?

51:47.280 --> 51:49.123
Hi, Molly. I'm Marcus Powell. Come with me.

51:50.680 --> 51:52.409
You think I don't know what you're doing?

51:53.040 --> 51:54.500
I know what you're doing!

51:54.600 --> 51:58.140
Lee, we're gonna put his girlfriend
onscreen so you can talk to her.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.260
It's all a big stall.

51:59.360 --> 52:01.100
And you're gonna keep
your mouth shut until then.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.420
You hear me?
Sitting up there, trying to figure out

52:03.520 --> 52:05.966
how to keep me
from pulling this fucking trigger.

52:06.760 --> 52:09.220
Well, this stupid fuck's
gonna make me shoot him in his head,

52:09.320 --> 52:11.060
and there's nothing
you can do about it, lady!

52:11.160 --> 52:13.460
Just remember our only goal
is to get him to put the weapon down.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.620
Jerking me around all fucking day.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.370
Okay, Matty, go ahead.

52:17.760 --> 52:19.091
- Okay.
- Get in there.

52:19.880 --> 52:22.900
Your 10 minutes were up a long time ago.
Hey. Hey!

52:23.000 --> 52:26.620
You fucking crazy?
What the fuck are you doing?

52:26.720 --> 52:29.166
Kyle? Are you there?

52:30.400 --> 52:33.300
Okay, circle around, circle around
so you get that girl on camera.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.700
- Kyle? Kyle?
- Molly.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.100
- Can he see me?
- Yeah, I can see you.

52:37.200 --> 52:38.565
- Yeah, he can see you.
- Yeah.

52:39.240 --> 52:41.740
- He's not... Kyle. Kyle?
- Molly.

52:41.840 --> 52:43.126
Yeah, Molly, where are you?

52:44.240 --> 52:46.083
- Are you here? Where is she?
- Kyle?

52:46.920 --> 52:48.060
- Is she outside?
- Can he hear me?

52:48.160 --> 52:49.366
- Molly?
- Kyle.

52:50.000 --> 52:51.161
Yeah?

52:51.880 --> 52:53.370
What are you doing here?

52:54.240 --> 52:55.980
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

52:56.080 --> 52:59.209
Kyle, what are you doing here?

53:00.080 --> 53:01.820
Why... I thought you were working today.

53:01.920 --> 53:02.921
God.

53:04.280 --> 53:09.320
You are the dumbest son of a bitch
on the planet, you know that?

53:10.160 --> 53:12.500
They told me about the money, Kyle.

53:12.600 --> 53:16.020
You are so fucking stupid.

53:16.120 --> 53:17.940
That was everything we had.

53:18.040 --> 53:20.060
That was every last cent.

53:20.160 --> 53:24.140
You are such a fucking failure, Kyle,
you know that?

53:24.240 --> 53:26.900
You have always been such a fucking failure.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.780
- You sat down in the basement all night...
- Molly, just...

53:28.880 --> 53:32.940
...reading your fucking books, thinking you
are some kind of a smart guy, but you aren't.

53:33.040 --> 53:36.220
You fucking aren't.
And now you go and you do this?

53:36.320 --> 53:38.700
You blow all your mother's money
like some kind of a halfwit

53:38.800 --> 53:41.620
and then you come in here
with a fucking bomb?

53:41.720 --> 53:42.700
Turn it off, for Christ's sake!

53:42.800 --> 53:44.260
You hardly even know
how to use a screwdriver!

53:44.360 --> 53:46.044
That is how useless you are
around the house!

53:46.160 --> 53:47.740
And now you're going
and you're building fucking bombs?

53:47.840 --> 53:49.888
Since when did you become
such a man all of a sudden?

53:50.480 --> 53:51.970
But you're not a man.

53:52.080 --> 53:54.060
- You're a bitch. That's what you are.
- Turn it off.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.260
You hear me, Kyle? You are a bitch.

53:56.360 --> 54:00.001
You cry when we fuck, you pasty little bitch!

54:01.720 --> 54:03.380
Get the fuck off me, motherfucker!

54:03.480 --> 54:06.300
- Don't you fucking touch her. Hey!
- I am seven months' pregnant!

54:06.400 --> 54:08.220
And fuck you, too, Kyle!

54:08.320 --> 54:10.060
This is all your fucking fault!

54:10.160 --> 54:11.780
Why don't you just get it over with

54:11.880 --> 54:14.660
and shoot yourself in the head already,
you chickenshit!

54:14.760 --> 54:18.685
Come on. Just pull the fucking trigger!
Pull the fucking...

54:25.400 --> 54:26.401
Hey.

54:27.680 --> 54:28.727
Kyle.

54:30.320 --> 54:33.802
Back off, guys. Back off a little bit.
Give us some room. Little bit.

54:38.160 --> 54:41.050
She's gone. You take a deep breath.

54:41.760 --> 54:44.445
You keep your finger on that button.

54:46.480 --> 54:48.369
You hear me, Kyle?

54:48.920 --> 54:51.660
- Give me some sign that you're hearing me.
- I'm fucking hearing you.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.000
Okay.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.041
Okay, here we go.

54:56.480 --> 54:57.720
Let's take a seat.

54:58.800 --> 54:59.801
Come on.

55:01.080 --> 55:03.651
Come on. That's it.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.006
Hey.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.762
It's hard to believe
you're the calm one in the relationship.

55:13.560 --> 55:14.561
All right.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.923
It's okay, Kyle.
We've all been there, believe me.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.649
Just take a minute.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.660
You take your time.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.603
Nobody's going anywhere.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.764
Is that him again? Is that the quant?

55:52.360 --> 55:56.580
Translate this exactly, Amy, all right?
Tell him I need to ask him some questions

55:56.680 --> 55:59.650
and if he doesn't talk to me,
then people are going to die.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.340
Fine. Put her on.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.488
- Put her on.
- Alright.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.780
You speak English?

56:06.880 --> 56:10.460
Listen, lady,
I'm not getting mixed up in all this.

56:10.560 --> 56:13.900
I was hired to design a program.
My job was about data.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.180
It was about math.
It was about theoreticals. That's it.

56:16.280 --> 56:19.060
Yes, but this glitch was still a result
of a program you designed.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.820
Wrong. It's user error.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.540
They're only calling it a glitch because
nobody understands how the algo works.

56:25.640 --> 56:28.540
And if nobody can understand the math,

56:28.640 --> 56:30.780
then nobody has to explain the money.

56:30.880 --> 56:34.660
Well, that's why I'm calling you.
I want to understand.

56:34.760 --> 56:35.841
Fine.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.540
Algorithms make patterns,
they don't break them.

56:40.640 --> 56:43.540
And this algo was designed
to move in and out

56:43.640 --> 56:45.980
of hundreds of positions
in fractions of seconds.

56:46.080 --> 56:47.060
Right.

56:47.160 --> 56:51.900
What it wasn't designed to do
is consume large amounts of capital,

56:52.000 --> 56:54.100
accumulate leveraged positions or...

56:54.200 --> 56:58.060
Or hold a portfolio
for any extended period of time.

56:58.160 --> 57:00.180
Wait. What does that mean?

57:00.280 --> 57:02.060
It means

57:02.160 --> 57:05.500
there is no way that this algorithm

57:05.600 --> 57:08.860
could lose $800 million in one afternoon.

57:08.960 --> 57:12.681
It is literally a mathematical impossibility.

57:13.360 --> 57:16.420
So whatever went wrong,
whatever investment went haywire,

57:16.520 --> 57:18.820
it's not the computer's fault.

57:18.920 --> 57:23.130
There's human fingerprints all over this.

57:23.960 --> 57:25.849
Whose fingerprints?

57:25.960 --> 57:30.300
Like I said,
I don't want to get involved in this.

57:30.400 --> 57:32.100
Is there anything you can give me?

57:32.200 --> 57:33.340
Do the math.

57:33.440 --> 57:37.240
You can't find your boss,
and he can't find $800 million.

57:37.960 --> 57:40.122
Where did you say he was coming from?

57:41.120 --> 57:42.565
What a mess, huh?

57:43.360 --> 57:44.900
I take it you've heard by now?

57:45.000 --> 57:46.540
Yeah.

57:46.640 --> 57:49.211
Goodloe started calling me
the second I turned my phone back on.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.860
He and I had a disagreement over strategy.

57:52.960 --> 57:54.803
So I heard.

57:56.360 --> 57:57.940
You did good.

57:58.040 --> 58:01.442
I'm proud of you... Whatever Goodloe says.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.928
Here, I got you some chocolate.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.370
From Switzerland.

58:13.040 --> 58:16.249
Hey, I'll take those
and put them in the back for you.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.764
That's cold.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.660
Amy, can you sit up front, please?

58:38.760 --> 58:40.489
And don't say a fucking word.

58:48.920 --> 58:53.140
She's right. She's fucking right.
She's fucking right.

58:53.240 --> 58:55.607
She's fucking right!

58:58.080 --> 59:00.162
God damn it! Jesus.

59:00.960 --> 59:02.180
God, why do you always do this?

59:02.280 --> 59:03.860
This isn't good, Lee.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.100
You're so stupid, Kyle.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.771
You're so stupid, you stupid pussy.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.500
She's fucking right.

59:12.600 --> 59:13.700
Now what?

59:13.800 --> 59:16.380
What the fuck am I fucking doing?

59:16.480 --> 59:17.811
Shit!

59:18.840 --> 59:20.808
Do not...

59:21.480 --> 59:22.720
I'll do it.

59:23.800 --> 59:25.220
You got to fucking do it.

59:25.320 --> 59:28.767
I got to fucking do it.
You stupid piece of fucking shit.

59:35.360 --> 59:37.140
What the fuck am I fucking doing?
I've got to do this.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.241
Kyle.

59:53.280 --> 59:55.647
What am I gonna do? Shoot you?

59:56.440 --> 59:58.920
I don't want to shoot you, Kyle.
I don't want you to die.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.844
What chance do I have now?

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:05.460
There's still a way out of this.
I know there's still a way out.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.660
Tell me one reason
why I shouldn't put this gun in my mouth

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.380
and pull the fucking trigger.

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.448
Kyle, look at me.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.580
Hey.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:15.330
You made a mistake.

01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:18.042
That doesn't mean your life is over.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.420
What you need is a plan.

01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.260
No way any plan's gonna
help me through this.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.940
That's 'cause you're not thinking straight.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.725
I'm willing to help you if you'll let me.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:30.580
Step one.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.140
This gun and this vest
is not helping anything.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.300
- I know what you're trying to do.
- Signals get crossed. Things get chaotic.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.260
Innocent people get hurt.
It happens all the time.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.046
If I let any of these guys go then I'm dead.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.011
Jesus.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.561
Jesus.

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.700
All right.

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.245
We'll find another way.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.166
You got to give me some space.
I need to rethink this.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:02.886
Is Fox 2 in position? Make your move.

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:06.300
A plan, Kyle.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.084
That's all we need.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.500
We just got unobstructed access,
north side studio.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.060
Repeat. Unobstructed access on the north.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.700
- Go with him. Extraction only, though.
- Sir.

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.723
Do you understand?
Extraction only right now.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.762
Listen, I agree with you.
We need to get ahead of this one.

01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.442
And we're all about transparency, after all.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:53.140
I'm the CEO, so I'm the one
who needs to make the statement.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.260
We just need to make sure it's on our terms,
not on theirs.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.980
We're all set up at Federal Hall.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.060
We have the run of the place,
we have security onsite,

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:01.650
and no one knows you'll be going there.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:06.046
We're going in.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.060
We got company.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.685
Three, show me.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:28.447
Okay, as long as it's controlled.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.380
Give an exclusive to somebody you trust.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.660
I know just the person to call.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.000
That's my girl.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.251
All right, Lenny?

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:43.528
I want you to push in.
Block as much of his view as you can.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.361
Lee?

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.524
Do not make a move.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.900
If he turns around,

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.650
we are all gonna die.

01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:01.607
Go.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.460
All right, Lenny.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.210
You're the last manned camera.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.087
Balls.

01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.401
Patty Fenn.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:32.420
Patty, Diane Lester.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:35.780
You better have something for me, Diane,
and I mean, right the fuck now.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.460
It's good to hear your voice, too.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.980
I'm calling you to let you know
the information I gave you

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.460
might have been incorrect.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.289
What the hell does that mean? "Incorrect"?

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.300
Walt is going to make a statement after all.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.500
We're in the car
en route to Federal Hall right now.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.020
We'll be about 20 minutes away.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.980
Twenty minutes? We need help right now!

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.140
I'm trying to help you,
if you'll just listen.

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.740
I'm going to send you a text
explaining what I need from you.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.020
So just keep a lid on it.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:02.442
Because I'm giving you this exclusively.
Don't screw it up.

01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.605
Reporters.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.131
Hello? Diane?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.660
Okay, everybody.
We're gonna begin evacuation one at a time.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.842
You first. Follow me to the crawlspace.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.620
We're ready and in position.
Give me the green light, we go.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.700
If we take out the receiver on Gates' chest,
what's his chance of survival?

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.980
80% that he makes it.

01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.460
Okay.
What's the chance the bullet's on target?

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.140
- If it's a clean shot, 100%.
- 100%. Come on, let's be realistic here.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.820
I am being. Listen, 80% sounds about right
to us, to an officer.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:33.980
80%.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:38.540
So we got an 80% chance of an 80% chance.
Yeah, that's some shit math.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:42.122
Benson, let me know
when the control room is ready to evacuate.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:50.860
Now we're talking.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.220
Okay, guys,

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.860
how do we find out what Walt Camby's jet
was doing in South Africa?

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:58.100
- We could try the FAA.
- No, they won't help us.

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:03.500
What about the hacker guy
from the Citi security breach segment?

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.365
- The guy with the Yoda voice.
- Yes! Yes! Find him. Quickly.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.042
Watch your head. Step here.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.043
Bree, where the hell is Ron Sprecher?
And has he gotten to the SEC yet?

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:20.580
I will check,
but I need to tell you something first.

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:22.060
Okay, hold on. Just a second.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.860
Lee, Walt Camby has landed.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.291
He's on his way to Federal Hall.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.740
He'll be there in less than 20 minutes.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.980
And get this. He wasn't in Geneva yesterday.
He was in South Africa.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.060
So he lied to you. He lied to us.

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:37.900
He's been lying this whole time.
That means you've been lying, too, Lee.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.447
To everybody that's been watching. To Kyle.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.281
Oh, my God.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.689
Where'd everybody go?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.441
Where'd they go?

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.740
God damn it!

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:56.420
I knew this would happen.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.620
- Let's go. Who's next?
- Charlie, in the sound booth.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.700
How stupid am I?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.100
Okay. Quick as you can.

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:02.440
Get those hackers working.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.570
It's all your fault, Lee. You so stupid.

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.690
This is Dave.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.086
I got your email, Dave.

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.124
Help you, we will.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.700
This is Eagle One. Target is in position.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.040
Bunch of crooks.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.580
Camby's never coming here.
We have to figure out a way, Kyle.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.820
Patty, I really need to tell you something.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.500
Okay, hold on, just a second, Bree.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.568
No! Damn it! You need to hear this.

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:59.340
Okay. What is it?

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:01.920
Don't stop. Don't panic. Stay low.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.100
I'm so fucked!

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:07.300
- Eagle, Do you have a clean shot?
- I'm yellow. Yellow.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.811
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.180
They're going to shoot Lee.
I heard every word. I was five-feet away.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.100
Let's go. This isn't voluntary.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:14.725
- Grab whatever you can grab.
- Jim. Take Jim.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.965
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.008
I can't catch a fucking break.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.180
I'm never getting out of here. Fuck!

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.260
Lee.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.442
- Just one time. One fucking time.
- They're making us leave.

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.642
- Don't stop. It's gonna be fine.
- I'm good. Get Patty.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:30.660
Look at me.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.380
Don't look up. Look at me.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.451
There is a sniper on the catwalk
at your one o'clock.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.730
Where'd they fucking go?

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.420
He's about to lose it, Benson.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.000
- Hold on. I got one lagging.
- Benson, hurry the hell up!

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.487
There is a receiver on your vest.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.810
- Two seconds, I pull out my cuffs.
- Don't look down.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:52.460
If he shoots it out, it disables the trigger.

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.766
Get out of there, right now!

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.860
Come on!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.860
- You got a shot?
- Are you green or red?

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.325
- Green.
- Take the shot!

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.450
- What are you doing? What are you doing?
- Fuck!

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.051
The button!

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.140
- Are you all right?
- What the fuck?

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.527
They're shooting at me, not you!
God damn it!

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.100
Just keep your finger on the button.

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.406
Lee, can you hear me?

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.340
What is this? You been talking to the cops
this whole time?

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:21.725
That's Patty.

01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.840
Listen to me!

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:26.124
She found Walt Camby.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.500
I'm gonna take you to him.
But you got to trust me.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.045
I got a plan.

01:08:32.479 --> 01:08:34.562
Listen, you got to block my vest.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520
Go.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.769
- Hey, wait. What are we doing?
- We're getting out of here.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.885
Give me the mike.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:49.300
Are you setting me up?

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.370
You want some answers?
We're gonna get some answers.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:53.779
Lenny, you coming?

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.211
We're coming out!

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.420
Lenny.

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.567
You mind?

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.520
Balls.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.404
Holy shit.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.247
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't like elevators.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:26.051
Come on, Lenny.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.090
Lenny, where are you?

01:09:28.439 --> 01:09:31.779
What did I ever do to deserve
such a loyal goddamn crew, Lenny?

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:33.404
- Not much.
- That's right.

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.841
I need a satellite van and an audio package
downstairs in two minutes.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.140
Lenny, where are you?

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.939
Jim, where's my feed with Lenny?
I need it right now.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:43.087
Come on, Lenny.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.140
Patty tells us to stay, we stay.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.604
Okay, Lenny's up! He's live.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.122
Yeah, Patty. It's always Patty.

01:09:51.359 --> 01:09:54.330
My first day on the job she told me
I had a penis where my brain should be.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.363
She's right. She's always right.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.980
She stayed here longer
than she should have.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.081
I know that.

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.046
The truth is I don't know what I'd do
without her at this point.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.651
But if she was standing right here,
right now, I couldn't admit that.

01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:15.363
But luckily it's just you in front of me,
Lenny. You and your...

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.289
Your warm eyes and your gentle soul.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.364
All right, get the fuck out of here.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.847
- I got a signal.
- Okay, are we live?

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.220
Time to find Diane Lester. Let's go.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.607
- If you're still with us, here we go.
- Come on.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:12.930
- We're going that way, Lenny. That way.
- Okay.

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.686
- Captain.
- No.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.329
We're on the move. Clear a path.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.180
- That van comes with us!
- Clear the sat van.

01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.660
What are these people doing here?

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.260
Now they've left the building.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.780
They are taking to the streets.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:39.886
Kyle Budwell and host Lee Gates
seem to be working together at this point.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:44.201
Hello?

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.420
We're on our way to you now,
but we need something more.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.860
We've figured out where,
we need to find out why.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.420
He's been lying about everything.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.220
Keep him away from the news
until we figure out the connection.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.970
I understand.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.340
Here. You should put your suit on.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.500
I'll come back up for you
once they're all set up.

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.840
Thanks.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.807
Jim, throw the feed into my sat van.

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.020
You stay with Lenny on foot.
We're gonna go nat sound from his camera.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.122
Where the hell is Ron Sprecher?

01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.331
Patty! I just left the SEC.
I've been trying to call you.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:21.441
Yeah, Ron, listen.

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.780
- Yeah, they got nothing over here.
- What?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.121
Ibis's algorithm trades in dark pools,

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.420
so all their transactions are concealed.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.940
The one thing I was able to find out was,
on the day of the crash,

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.740
Ibis's transaction volume

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:34.780
dropped by nearly 90%.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:36.120
What does that mean?

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.125
I don't know.

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.700
How far away are you?

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.580
I'm on... Where am I? I'm on Vesey Street.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.300
Bring me what you have, Ron.
I'll meet you at the corner of Pearl and Pine.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:45.500
Start running. I'll see you in three minutes.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.940
What, three minutes? That's a half-mile away!
I can't run a half-mile in three...

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.041
Hello?

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.300
What are you folks doing?

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.580
He's not O.J.!
Get off the street! That's a bomb!

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.180
Bombs explode.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.860
You don't want to be near them
when they do.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.500
Frank Ross,
reporting from the eye in the sky.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.100
He is safely hovering above them.

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:07.940
It's a rather distressing scene
down here, honestly.

01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:12.020
New Yorkers flocking to the melee
despite repeated police warnings

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.460
to stay clear of the path of a man
with a bomb strapped to his chest.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.860
Apparently, a lot of people
sharing the feelings

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.540
of gunman Kyle Budwell this moment.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:23.980
They are lining the streets,
they're cheering him on, as if to say,

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.684
"Hey, Ibis, show us the money."

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:40.220
They're a bunch of crooks!
Blow 'em all to hell!

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.606
Get off me, man! Come on!

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:45.980
Stay close.
Don't let them get a shot at the vest.

01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.163
Now might be a good time
to tell you something about that vest then.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:54.340
There's not actually any Semtex in there.
It's just clay. Blocks of clay.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:55.420
What?

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.842
Yeah, I wanted to get your attention,
not blow up a goddamn building.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:02.683
Stand down. Easy.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.100
Well, they think it's real.

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.100
So whatever you do, don't take your finger
off that goddamn trigger.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.780
We're in this together, you dumb shit.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.700
The drama featuring
host Lee Gates and Kyle Budwell.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.620
Wow, this is getting crazy!

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.940
Look at all these people!

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:26.883
My phone is blowing up on this.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.340
If Kyle makes it out of this thing,
we got to get him on the show.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:33.365
And the next time I have a bad day,
I'm gonna come in, "Glitch!"

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.460
Diane, why would Ibis's trading volume
suddenly drop 90%?

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.700
90%?

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.140
No, that's not possible.
Ibis's algorithms trade continuously.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.891
Somebody would have had to have
taken the computers offline.

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.087
They would have...

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:50.363
Human fingerprints.

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.085
Walt.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.540
If Walt took that $800 million
away from the algorithm,

01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.140
what did he do with it?

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.527
I have his phone. Shit.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.300
He's deleted all his emails.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.620
Try texts.

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.700
Goodloe.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.980
Mambo... Mambo...

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.060
He and the COO keep mentioning
"Mambo" over and over again.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.180
"Mambo"?

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:11.700
Mambo, like the dance?

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:13.580
- "Mambo"?
- Keep it clear. Back it up, back it up!

01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.284
Hey! Hey!

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.180
Get out of the way! Hey!

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.361
Get out of the way!

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.460
Patty!

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.005
- We're on it, Diane.
- Stop. Stop. Stop. Patty.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:27.380
Get this earpiece to Lee.
He needs to hear me.

01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.100
Great. But how exactly
am I supposed to get this to him?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.044
I don't know, Ron. You're a producer.
Produce your way up there!

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.611
I'm not getting anything on the terminal.
I'm gonna do a web search.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.049
Okay, I'm getting...

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.940
"Mambo Pizza Place..."

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.180
"Mambo Italiano..." I'm not finding anything.

01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.500
"Mambo Snakes."

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.700
"Mamba" snakes. That's not it.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.780
Try "Mambo South Africa."
Try anything South African.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.881
Got it. One sec.

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.321
Holy shit.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.962
It's not a program. It's a goddamn person.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:11.086
Remember Zuccotti Park!

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.086
Occupy Wall Street!

01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:17.242
Hey, Lee! Lee!

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.001
Hey!

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.407
Lee!

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.287
Lee!

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:33.083
Do it, man! Come on. Blow this mother up!

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.721
Lee! Lee, hey! Lee! Your earpiece!

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.846
- Shit.
- Ron!

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.165
Do not shoot!

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.851
Do not shoot!

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.726
Lee, can you hear me?

01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.940
Camera mike's down.
He's not gonna be able to respond.

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:02.408
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Stay where you are!

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.401
Lee?

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.448
Lee, are you there?
If you can hear me, put your hand in the air.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.965
Okay. I can see you, but I can't get to you.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.883
What am I gonna do?

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.844
We either keep going or we stop.
It's up to you.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.860
ESU, forward.

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.740
First window we get,
we're taking the assailant down.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:44.921
Move them back.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.123
- Stay down.
- Stay behind the car.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.780
Diane, are you still there?

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:00.860
Yeah, I'm here.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.803
Okay. We are on Mambo.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.700
Our van can't get any closer.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:06.220
So keep Walt there.

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.164
Do not let him run before Lee can get to you.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.660
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.921
All right. Get on it, Dave.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.610
Print out everything you can
on this miners' strike.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.849
- I'm gonna need that, too.
- Okay.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:18.041
Lee?

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.524
You can hear me now.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.329
Which is good.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.260
I have a lot to explain,

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:28.523
and I need you to listen
very carefully for once.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.605
We're approaching Federal Hall.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.722
Jesus. Is that live?

01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.965
It is now.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.020
Did you get all that?
And that's before we start digging.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.169
- Ibis is a pig in a prom dress, Lee.
- Got it.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.820
We are trying to find the proof right now.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.660
See if you can get those hacker guys.
Find out what they've come up with.

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:51.140
Now, Lee,
we're making a pretty big leap here.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.700
So if Walt's gonna hang himself,
you're gonna have to hand him that rope.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.327
I'll just point the camera in your direction,
and we'll figure it out together.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.643
Hey. Get ready for a show.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.900
Well, these guys are certainly behaving

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.380
like they've got an appointment
with the Ibis Clear Capital CEO.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.780
Which begs the question
on everyone's mind,

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.689
where is Walt Camby?

01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:16.780
As a curious crowd assembles
outside Federal Hall,

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.260
the missing piece of the puzzle...

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:19.486
I trusted you.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.608
Yeah, well, I trusted you, too.

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.168
So I guess that means we're both wrong.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.485
What did you do, Diane?
I mean, you know me.

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.460
You know me better than my wife.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:33.688
- You know me better than anybody.
- I'm not so sure that's true.

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.260
I have no idea what you think I did.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.885
Save it for the cameras, Walt.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.620
An eyewitness in the crowd
may just have the answer.

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:42.860
Walt Camby?

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.180
He's inside. He just went up those stairs
and through those doors.

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.260
- You saw him?
- That's right.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.300
Guess there's nowhere to run now, huh?

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.370
This story does seem to be coming
to some sort of head down here.

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.780
- Hey there, big shot.
- Hey.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.420
- Ready for that interview now?
- Hey.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.500
Hey.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:24.648
You're just in time for the show.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.980
How was Geneva?

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.540
- It was fine.
- Yeah, I hear it's lovely this time of year.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.005
Can we get him a chair?

01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:33.090
Sam, give him a chair.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.540
The Iceland guys just came through
with all the facial recognition data.

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.500
This footage goes back months.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:41.100
Everywhere he's traveled.
There's way too much stuff.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.340
Okay, well, just focus on the last 48 hours.
And cue up the video package.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.580
Can we get everybody outta here?
Young lady, please, exit the building.

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.060
Wait a second, why does she get to leave?

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.820
This might be able to help
with your investigation.

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.540
This is all her fault.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.980
Go ahead, Diane, walk away.

01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.740
You're the only reason we're stuck here
with this psycho.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:58.260
You wanted transparency, Walt?
Well, here's your chance.

01:20:58.360 --> 01:20:59.361
Let's go.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:02.441
Everybody hates you.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.129
Okay, now look, everything is fine.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.300
So why don't we just put the weapons down,
and let's just talk about it.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.449
No, I... I think we can talk
with the weapons up. Right, guys?

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.726
- This is Money Monster, coming to you live.
- Back off.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.100
We're here with Ibis CEO Walt Camby.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:19.700
So, Walt,
now that we have you here in person,

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.280
we can finally ask the $800 million question.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.885
What happened at Ibis, Walt?

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.641
As we've been saying since day one,
this was an isolated computer glitch.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.700
Goddamn it!

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:34.540
- Glitch!
- He doesn't really like that word.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.180
I fuckin' hate that word!

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.500
Not the glitch.

01:21:37.600 --> 01:21:39.380
- Cue up video one.
- I fucking hate that word.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.403
And then line the rest of 'em up on my mark.

01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:45.322
You tried to convince us it's all too
complicated for us to understand.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.888
But it's not that complicated at all, is it?

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:51.120
It's actually the oldest story
in the book. Fraud.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:55.060
You took money out of your fund
and you invested it here.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.321
Go.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.368
Right here in platinum mines in South Africa.
Does that sound familiar?

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.780
I don't have our portfolio in front of me.
I can't exactly...

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.500
You really need your portfolio
to know where you put $800 million?

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.500
I don't put that much money anywhere.

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.860
The algorithms control our day-to-day...

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.060
But that's not how high-frequency trading
is supposed to work, is it?

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.260
They don't just put that much money
in one place

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.249
and just leave it there, do they?

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.926
It wasn't the algos pullin' the strings,
it was you.

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:26.100
The miners' union strike here
outside Johannesburg is on its second week.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.380
You. You bought and paid
for a two-week strike.

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:31.084
Come on. This is ridiculous.

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:32.521
Go.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.780
The strike had caused
the mining company's stock to drop.

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.884
You buy low, you get the strike to stop,
you sell high.

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.201
That's the plan.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.450
You make one big bribe to the right guy,
line your own pockets,

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:44.686
and no one'll be the wiser.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.140
You're making accusations
that have no basis in reality.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:49.287
Video three on my mark.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.020
- All right, all right, all right. One...
- Get it together.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.340
- Okay, it's there. Got it.
- It's defamation, okay?

01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.620
And there are laws about that.

01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:55.620
Go on, Walt.
Tell me about all the laws I'm breaking.

01:22:55.720 --> 01:22:57.300
Ready when you are, Lee. On your mark.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:22:58.460
Look, I'll give you this.

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:02.060
There really was a glitch in your system.
It just wasn't the computer.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.780
It was this guy. Moshe Mambo.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.006
We must say no!

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.660
We must say no to their businesses!
We must say no to their bribes!

01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.684
You tried to bribe the one guy
that couldn't be bought.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.406
All they care about is money!

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.244
If it takes two years, if it takes 20 years,

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.100
we will stay here and strike
until our voices are heard.

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:27.247
Pause.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:31.482
There. Right there. That's your glitch.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.660
Because that's what sent
the mining company's stock plummeting,

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.286
which sent
your secret $800 million investment

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:38.731
right into the toilet.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.683
Want me to keep goin'?

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.660
- Patty. You gotta see this.
- You made people a lot of money, Walt.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.060
You just needed to wreck industries and
destroy economies all over the world to do it.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.289
Okay. Get that ready right now. Lee?

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:53.100
You're gonna say everything I say.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.201
This is insane.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.700
I don't know the first thing
about some South African workers' strike.

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.041
I've never even heard of this Mambo.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.300
- Really? Never?
- Really? Never?

01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.100
Well, what were you two arguing about
this morning?

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.965
Then what were you two arguing about
this morning

01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:09.980
at 8:02 a.m., local time?

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:12.380
Or maybe they're speaking Swahili
in Geneva these days.

01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.450
They don't speak Swahili
in South Africa, either.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.340
And this wasn't the first time
you did it, either.

01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:22.046
This was just the first time
it didn't work out.

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.164
You feel that, Walt?

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:29.366
That sticky heat
risin' up the back of your neck?

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.324
That flop sweat?

01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.005
That's fear.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.642
Greed you're already acquainted with.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.291
That's all a great story, Lee.
I'm actually sorry the real one's so boring.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.860
But the truth is,
our computational systems are far too...

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.380
You know, forget it. Just shoot him.

01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.323
Actually, I got a better idea.

01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.489
Up. Up, up, up.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.447
Take the vest off. Put it on him.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:54.860
- Yeah?
- Go ahead.

01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:56.300
Hold on.
That's just gonna make things worse.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:58.164
I already told you, back off.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:24:59.601
Fuckin' cops.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.524
- Lenny.
- All right.

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.649
- Now? Okay.
- Just right here.

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:06.380
Listen, I'm gonna do you a solid.
And trust me on this.

01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.209
Don't turn your back on anybody.

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.207
You're a thief, Walt.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.100
And a crook.

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.770
And I want to hear you admit it.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.980
I didn't steal a dime,

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.540
- and we didn't do anything illegal.
- Bullshit!

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.740
- You manipulated stock prices.
- You don't care what I'm gonna say.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.940
- You bribed people.
- You need someone to blame.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.860
- You broke the law.
- You've already decided it's gonna be me.

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:28.203
What law?
Name one law you can prove I broke.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:30.409
No, don't look at him.
He can't prove it, either.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:33.126
This is just business.
And this is how business is done.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.851
- That doesn't make it right.
- Please.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.570
Tell that to the Chinese.

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.940
Tell that to the Russians.
'Cause if it's not us, it's gonna be them.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.087
Hell, it already is.

01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.660
You see, that's the irony about all this.

01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.603
You only came after me
'cause I lost you money.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:48.540
Nobody was asking questions
when everybody was makin' a profit.

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:51.484
You just gobbled up every dollar of stock
you could afford.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:54.900
As long as we kept paying you 18% ROI
every year,

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.460
then you could keep bragging to your friends
about what a genius you are.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.420
But, hey, you're not a genius,

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.620
you're a stockholder.

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:01.900
I told you what I want.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.980
Yeah, I get it. You want a profit.
That's what everybody wants.

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.940
- No, that's not what I want.
- Listen, just give us some time.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.020
We're gonna make every single dime...

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.380
I want to hear you admit it,
you son of a bitch!

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:10.481
I think he just did.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.604
No, I want to hear him say that he lied,
that what he did was wrong.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.140
Wrong? What does that even mean, wrong?

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:18.980
You got three seconds till I blow your ass
outta this goddamn building.

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.140
- Three.
- What's wrong with makin' a profit?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:22.060
- What's wrong with being faster...
- Two!

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.620
What's wrong with betting big?
Winning isn't wrong...

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.085
- One!
- Fine!

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.726
It was wrong.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:33.450
- It was wrong.
- Oh, my...

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:35.166
It was wrong.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.725
It was wrong.

01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.409
That's all I wanted to hear, man.

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:44.971
- Did you hear that?
- Nice.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:03.681
Kyle, don't.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:07.131
Kyle, don't.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.444
- Kyle, don't!
- No! Fuck! Don't!

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.380
- God! Kyle, no!
- Stand down!

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:13.811
- Goddamn it!
- I said stand down!

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.140
- Get his gun!
- I said stand down!

01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.340
- Hey!
- Call an ambulance!

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:18.060
- Shots fired. Repeat, we've got shots fired.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:20.561
What are you doin' to him?
Get him an ambulance!

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.100
Get him an ambulance!
Get him an ambulance!

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.580
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get off! What are you...

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.380
- Room is secure!
- He can't breathe!

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.323
- Hey!
- What are you doin' to him?

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.844
Get him an ambulance!

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.485
Hey, Kyle, you hang in there, buddy!

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.166
Kyle!

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.720
You hang in there, buddy.

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:54.340
- You're good to go, pal.
- Yeah.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.441
You're all set.

01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.847
That kid's a nutcase.

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.891
You son of a bitch.

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.280
Hey, all right.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.641
- Just sit down.
- You see that? He just assaulted me.

01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:10.060
Call a cop.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.161
You got a pulse?

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.046
You got anything?

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.241
No, sir.

01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.683
Oh, my God.

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:33.249
They shot him. Did you see that?

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.045
Clear for the coroner.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.245
Copy that.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.690
This is Powell. He's been taken out.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.844
Called at 3:58 p.m.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.809
Clear it. Studio has control.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.700
Excuse me, sir. A quick question.

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:40.962
You had the chance to leave.
Why did you stay?

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.700
I was just... I was just doin' my job.

01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:47.485
You know, I don't quit
until the director tells me to.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.020
Your name is?

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.380
My name is Lenny Libatino. It's...
it's L-E-N-N-Y, not... Not the I-E.

01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.970
When did you know you were in danger?

01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.620
I think right from the gunshot, you know,

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.008
but, like I said, I was more interested
in keeping him in the frame.

01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:06.060
Maybe I should have got hair and makeup
for Lenny, huh?

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:08.891
Host Lee Gates is recuperating
in a downtown hospital,

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:14.087
along with wounded producer Ron Sprecher.
He is expected to make a full recovery.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.481
How's Ron?

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.290
He's out of surgery, he's in recovery.
He's gonna be fine.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.686
Good.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:24.164
- What do you got there?
- Dinner.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:27.007
I heard you had an opening in your schedule.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.620
So this is a Friday night for you, huh?

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.846
Yep.

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.529
...thanks to this single individual.
Back to you, Sherry.

01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:39.460
The gunman's name is Kyle Budwell,

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.700
24 years old, a parcel truck driver
from Queens, New York.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.140
Further details about him are still unknown
at this hour, as are concrete motives.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.940
But it's been reported
that personal financial troubles,

01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:51.980
coupled with his mother's death
six months ago,

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.980
could have been contributing factors.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.084
And regulators are saying,
"Not so fast, Walt Camby."

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.940
The SEC just announced
that Ibis Clear Capital

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:03.362
is facing a Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act investigation.

01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:08.248
Violations of that act
can carry heavy criminal and civil penalties.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.820
Meanwhile, Vines of Ibis's CEO Walt Camby

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.420
have quickly become an online phenomenon,

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:18.411
variations of which have already racked up
over 10 million views online.

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.250
No! No! Fuck!

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.324
No! No! Fuck!

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.140
No! No! Fuck!

01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.844
Sherry Benedict, thank you for that report.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:30.020
We'll come back to you later in the day
as more information emerges.

01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.180
So what the hell kind of show
are we gonna do next week?

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:33.725
Things aren't all bad
for the Money Monster host,

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.460
as viewership of Money Monster,
which had recently slid in the ratings,

01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:40.723
skyrocketed after word
of the hostage crisis spread.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:44.609
Lee Gates may owe that gunman
a debt of thanks.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:46.980
Well, it may have been an eventful afternoon

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.140
outside the actual Stock Exchange,

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.460
but it was a rather pedestrian day inside.
The Dow was down nine points, less than...

01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:56.780
NASDAQ dropped 13 points,
thanks to a shaky morning in the tech sector.

01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:00.220
Wall Street is a casino.
They're gambling with your money.

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:05.060
Your company was called "a great vampire
squid wrapped around the face of humanity."

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:08.243
He found his fame on YouTube, of all places.
