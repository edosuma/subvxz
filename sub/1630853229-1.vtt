WEBVTT

03:08.318 --> 03:11.974
-Is this all of ours?
-Yeah, it's all ours.

03:17.719 --> 03:20.417
Leave the door open.
The others are right behind us.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.811
-They're always so slow!
-Always slow.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.294
-Wow.
-That's it? Wow?

03:41.482 --> 03:43.266
I told you it was only
20 minutes away.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.355
Yeah, by car, Mom.

03:45.399 --> 03:48.402
Do you ever try and see things
from someone else's perspective?

03:50.534 --> 03:51.883
Holy shit!

03:53.276 --> 03:55.060
Yeah, it's pretty impressive!

03:56.192 --> 03:58.107
No. Holy shit! It's so ugly.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.722
Idiot!

04:14.515 --> 04:16.517
Mom!

04:20.912 --> 04:24.046
-The dust is back.
-I'll get a vacuum.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.353
Steve, I wanna show you
your room. Come on.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.846
A play room, cool!

04:41.890 --> 04:44.153
-And you set up all my games.
-Just for you.

04:54.772 --> 04:57.949
I don't know why we have to keep
all these creepy paintings
and old stuff.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.691
Well, they came with the house.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.954
We'll probably get rid
of most of it.

05:02.998 --> 05:04.565
Here, this will cheer you up.

05:09.918 --> 05:12.921
-Stevie, come on.
-Coming!

05:16.359 --> 05:18.405
Yes! All our stuff!

05:18.448 --> 05:21.973
-Yay, belongings.
-I thought you'd be pleased.

05:22.017 --> 05:25.107
-You know nothing about me, Mom.
-Ellie.

05:25.150 --> 05:28.023
You might like this room.
Follow me.

05:31.113 --> 05:32.462
Come on.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.992
You know, when I was a kid,

05:41.036 --> 05:42.864
I would have loved to have
lived in a place like this.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.178
What's in there?

05:55.311 --> 05:56.965
That's the cellar.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.324
Why don't you check it out?

06:20.249 --> 06:22.251
It's filthy.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.515
I like to think of it
as character.

06:25.559 --> 06:30.346
Yeah. Nothing to see here.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.057
Get me out!

06:46.101 --> 06:48.843
There's something wrong
with the lock.

06:49.713 --> 06:51.846
-C'mon, it's not funny.
-Hang on, Ellie.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.195
Dad, c'mon!

06:59.201 --> 07:02.944
-Mom? Mom, Dad, get me out!
-OK, just wait. Calm down.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.384
Get me out!

07:08.428 --> 07:11.343
Brian, there's a key.
Over there, there's a key.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.650
-C'mon! Mom!
-We've got the key.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.044
-Just a minute.
-Get me out!

07:20.701 --> 07:22.833
-Hang on.
-Please, c'mon!

07:22.877 --> 07:24.444
Mom!

07:27.795 --> 07:29.449
Get me out!

07:30.580 --> 07:32.800
Get me out!

07:36.325 --> 07:38.240
-I'm done here.
-Ellie.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.590
-I'm not staying in this house!
-That's weird.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.269
You OK?
Can I come in?

08:16.278 --> 08:17.453
Hm...

08:19.455 --> 08:22.023
Listen, I wanted to ask
your opinion about something.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.681
What does this
make you think of?

08:31.032 --> 08:33.469
Absolutely nothing.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.297
But do they look like
they're having fun?

08:37.473 --> 08:40.128
They look like
brainwashed sheep.

08:40.171 --> 08:42.913
C'mon, Mom, don't you have focus
groups for this sort of thing?

08:42.957 --> 08:45.307
Well, I wanted
your perspective.

08:45.960 --> 08:49.137
-I hate your job, Mom.
-OK.

08:50.965 --> 08:53.315
Listen, I need you to watch
Steven tonight.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.144
We have to go into the office,
but we won't be late, I promise.

08:56.187 --> 08:59.147
So, you're leaving us here
on our first night?

08:59.974 --> 09:02.019
Come on, Ellie.
This one's a big deal.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.370
This one's important, OK?

09:06.328 --> 09:07.677
Fine.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.158
Thanks.

09:15.816 --> 09:17.644
Why did we have to move here,
Mom?

09:19.689 --> 09:22.126
I'm doing this for you guys.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.302
-So that you have a better life.
-No, you're not.

09:24.346 --> 09:26.566
You're doing it for yourself.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.636
-Where are your parents?
-They're in work.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.421
You're kidding?
You've just moved in.

09:56.465 --> 10:00.164
Yeah, they've an important pitch
tomorrow.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.558
She says they need it
to survive.

10:03.428 --> 10:06.388
I hope they go bust
and we have to sell the house.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.390
Come on, Ellie.
Maybe it won't be that bad.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.002
I don't know.

10:12.046 --> 10:16.528
I just miss everyone.
I miss you.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.922
Why don't you come and hang out?

10:18.966 --> 10:22.099
-I could come stay with you.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.841
-Yeah, why don't you?
-Just a minute.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.757
- You OK?
-It's nothing.

10:29.411 --> 10:30.281
Ellie?

10:32.283 --> 10:34.895
-Is everything OK? Ellie?
-I'm gonna kill you.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.592
Ellie!

10:37.724 --> 10:41.336
This is Sophie,
19-year-old vlogger, influencer.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.556
She's living
a jet-set lifestyle.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.384
Except she's not.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.952
She's an actress and we plan
to present her as a real vlogger

10:48.996 --> 10:50.737
with a real-life narrative.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.696
Now, these are some of the
initial ads which we will run

10:53.740 --> 10:56.438
on all social media platforms
to support the video content.

10:58.266 --> 11:01.312
You changed the colour
of her bracelet?

11:01.356 --> 11:03.271
Oh, we thought it was too...

11:03.314 --> 11:05.665
-Change it back.

11:07.101 --> 11:09.320
-I can take it.
-I got it.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.717
Ellie, what's up?

11:14.761 --> 11:16.719
-Mom, Steven keeps messing.

11:16.763 --> 11:19.243
He won't stay in bed.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.768
-We're going in!
-Put him on the phone.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.641
-Hello?
-Steven, come on, behave.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.643
-Or you'll be sorry for a week.
-OK.

11:31.386 --> 11:34.824
So, the target audience is
pretty self-explanatory,

11:34.868 --> 11:36.957
-16 to 19-year-olds.
-What did I miss?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.574
Where did you get this?

11:47.141 --> 11:49.012
I found them in there.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.710
What the...?

11:54.975 --> 11:56.585
I've had it with this house.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.981
Morgan from my class told me
the house was owned by a witch

12:01.024 --> 12:03.157
who made a pact with the devil.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.159
What? It's true!

12:08.249 --> 12:09.729
What's that?

12:30.227 --> 12:32.839
Delta...
Point vector... Sum...

12:33.796 --> 12:35.667
Epsilon...

12:35.711 --> 12:41.195
Partial One equals...
One N... DY by DX...

12:41.238 --> 12:43.371
One...

12:44.415 --> 12:46.548
Two...

12:46.591 --> 12:48.768
Three...

12:48.811 --> 12:50.726
Four...

12:51.379 --> 12:53.424
-Five...

12:53.468 --> 12:55.035
Six...

12:55.557 --> 12:57.689
-That's enough.

12:57.733 --> 13:01.215
-OK, bed.
-Ugh!

13:13.401 --> 13:14.968
Naomi?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.672
Naomi?

13:31.419 --> 13:33.073
Hello?

14:10.806 --> 14:12.460
Naomi?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.629
This demographic, teenage girls,
they respond well

14:51.673 --> 14:53.805
to aspirational marketing
and social competition,

14:53.849 --> 14:55.938
so can we create
a weekly vlogging chart

14:55.982 --> 14:58.201
where vloggers compete
to receive the most likes?

14:58.245 --> 15:00.203
Who's the prettiest?
Who gets the guy?

15:00.247 --> 15:03.032
-Natural selection.
-Law of the jungle.

15:03.076 --> 15:06.557
No, we call the competition
Natural Selection.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.560
-Nice.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.954
Ellie!

15:11.998 --> 15:14.522
Mom, all the lights
have gone out.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.742
Are the wall sockets out, too?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.529
-Yeah, I think so.
-All right.

15:21.572 --> 15:24.227
We have to see if the power's
cut or if we've blown a fuse,

15:24.271 --> 15:26.838
so I need you to go down
and check the circuit breaker,

15:26.882 --> 15:28.840
see if any of the trip switches
are down.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.842
I'm not going down
to that cellar.

15:30.886 --> 15:33.149
I'm not kidding you.
I'm leaving now.

15:33.193 --> 15:36.587
Ellie, can you just do this one
thing for Steven, if not for me?

15:36.631 --> 15:39.025
What if he wakes up in the dark
and no one's there?

15:41.462 --> 15:43.333
Fine.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.292
Listen, I'll stay on the line
with you.

15:57.391 --> 16:02.048
-Mom? Mom, are you still there?
-I'm here. I'm on the line.

16:30.032 --> 16:31.816
Are you OK?

16:34.819 --> 16:39.650
I can't see anything. I don't
know if I can do this, Mom.

16:39.694 --> 16:41.957
I know you can do this.

16:44.133 --> 16:47.615
Mom, I'm scared.
I'm sorry, I can't.

16:47.658 --> 16:51.575
You know what I do when
I'm scared, to clear my mind?

16:51.619 --> 16:53.273
-I count.
-Ah, no, not that, Mom.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.579
No, listen, there's ten steps
to the bottom.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.320
You counted them?

16:57.364 --> 17:00.802
Would you just... Could you just
trust me for once?

17:03.631 --> 17:05.981
-I'll try.
-Good.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.592
Now, I want you to count each
step, can you do that?

17:08.636 --> 17:11.465
-Yes.
-OK, just listen to my voice

17:11.508 --> 17:13.249
and nothing else,
just focus on the counting.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.816
Concentrate on that.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.353
One.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.443
-Good. Next step.

17:33.487 --> 17:36.055
-Two.
-OK, keep going.

17:39.841 --> 17:41.625
-Three.

17:41.669 --> 17:43.105
You're doing well.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.889
That's great, OK? Four.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.509
Four.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.036
Four.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.698
It's OK, it's fine.
Keep breathing.

18:10.741 --> 18:12.265
Concentrate.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.096
-Five.
-You're halfway there.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.887
Six.

18:28.890 --> 18:31.066
Just four more.

18:31.110 --> 18:34.025
OK? Don't quit now.
You're doing great, Ellie.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.723
Just keep counting.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.073
Seven.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.687
Eight.

18:43.731 --> 18:45.211
Good.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.087
Nine.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.961
One more.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.278
Ten.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.803
You're at the bottom. Can you
see the pillar in front of you?

19:12.847 --> 19:15.197
Eleven.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.590
Twelve.

19:17.765 --> 19:19.245
Thirteen.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.421
Fourteen.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.119
Fifteen.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.991
Sixteen.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.515
Seventeen.

19:29.690 --> 19:30.952
Eighteen.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.172
Nineteen.

19:34.216 --> 19:35.609
Twenty.

19:36.436 --> 19:38.002
Twenty-one.

19:38.829 --> 19:40.179
Twenty-two.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.833
Twenty-three.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.314
Twenty-four.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.536
Twenty-five. Twenty-six.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.452
Twenty-seven.

19:53.322 --> 19:54.671
Twenty-eight.

19:55.977 --> 19:58.327
Twenty-nine. Thirty.

20:01.504 --> 20:03.289
Ellie?

20:03.332 --> 20:06.292
-Ellie?
-Ellie!

20:21.263 --> 20:23.091
She's not here.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.010
What's going on?

20:34.711 --> 20:37.236
-Ellie!

20:39.325 --> 20:40.674
Ellie!

20:44.547 --> 20:45.853
Ellie!

20:53.556 --> 20:55.210
Ellie!

20:56.429 --> 20:59.519
-I think she's run away again.
-Right. She's done this before.

20:59.562 --> 21:02.522
Yeah, she'll turn up after
a few days in a friend's house.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.841
Why don't you go inside
and play?

22:36.964 --> 22:39.619
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:50.630 --> 22:52.458
She was right.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.375
About what?

22:59.160 --> 23:01.815
When she said I didn't know
who she was any more.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.387
She's grown up
and we haven't even noticed.

23:09.344 --> 23:12.478
No, she's still
a little girl to me.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.655
There's no way she ran away.

23:17.570 --> 23:20.573
She was angry, you know,
she's upset with us.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.535
You didn't hear her voice.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.757
Counting.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.274
Hello?

24:53.317 --> 24:56.756
Oh, I'm so sorry. I totally
forgot. I'll be right there.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.082
I'm sorry, Steven.

25:19.126 --> 25:21.520
I completely forgot.

25:23.217 --> 25:25.349
Did Ellie come back?

25:26.307 --> 25:27.743
No.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.353
Not yet.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.463
We've talked
to her friends.

25:52.507 --> 25:54.770
We've pulled CCTV from
every bus and train station,

25:54.814 --> 25:56.337
but no leads, unfortunately.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.821
We've checked
her social media history

26:01.864 --> 26:04.171
and there's a lot of harassment.

26:05.825 --> 26:08.175
Quite nasty bullying.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.090
Did she mention this to you?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.530
No.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.533
Well, don't worry,
she gave as good as she got.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.364
She didn't run away.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.497
Why do you say that?

26:26.541 --> 26:28.674
Something happened
in the cellar.

26:28.717 --> 26:30.850
I heard her voice, it was...

26:32.112 --> 26:33.940
She didn't sound right.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.248
Have you tracked her cell phone?

26:38.292 --> 26:43.689
Er... Her phone pinged off
the Three Rock mast at 8.42pm.

26:43.732 --> 26:47.562
That was me. I...
I talked to her.

26:48.084 --> 26:52.611
Can't you just please
check the house again?

26:52.654 --> 26:56.353
Where I last talked to her in
the cellar, for clues, anything.

26:56.397 --> 26:58.878
I can come up and take a look
again, if you want.

26:58.921 --> 27:01.402
What about specialists?
Forensics?

27:01.445 --> 27:03.404
It's not a criminal case.

27:03.447 --> 27:04.710
I'm really sorry.

28:26.835 --> 28:29.098
Steven? Come here.

28:40.196 --> 28:43.852
How was Ellie the night...
the last night?

28:43.896 --> 28:45.680
The same as always.

28:47.900 --> 28:50.206
Is there anything
that you forgot to tell us

28:50.250 --> 28:51.817
or anything strange?

28:52.774 --> 28:54.341
We played that.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.566
Go on.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.938
It's paint, plant-based

32:19.981 --> 32:22.941
so the chlorophyll shows up
as red under the UV light.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.813
It's very old. It's been there
since the '50s, maybe.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.686
Do you know anything
about the house's history?

32:29.730 --> 32:32.602
No, no.
We bought it at an auction.

32:32.646 --> 32:35.518
House and contents -
got it for nothing.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.913
Couldn't really turn down
that opportunity for the kids.

32:39.827 --> 32:43.178
I think, um... Might have been
an elderly lady?

32:43.222 --> 32:46.312
Who needed to make a quick sale
for nursing home costs?

32:47.095 --> 32:49.358
Well, the team haven't found
anything else

32:49.402 --> 32:51.404
that would give us
cause for concern.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.190
I'm afraid that's all we can do
for tonight.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.975
I'll follow up with you
in the morning.

32:59.151 --> 33:02.110
I promise you
we're doing everything we can.

33:02.154 --> 33:04.330
Thanks. I'll show you out.

33:51.290 --> 33:52.595
Mom.

33:52.639 --> 33:55.120
God! Steven!

33:56.643 --> 33:59.472
-What's the matter?
-I wet the bed.

34:01.169 --> 34:04.303
It's OK. Come on.
Let's get you changed.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.567
OK.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.831
What happened to Ellie?

34:14.226 --> 34:16.445
I don't know, Steven.

34:16.489 --> 34:20.058
But whatever did happen to her,
I promise you

34:20.101 --> 34:22.973
that we will do everything in
our power to get her back, OK?

34:23.017 --> 34:24.671
-OK.
-OK.

34:28.501 --> 34:29.893
Get some sleep.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.989
Hey, this is Ellie.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.689
I can't answer the phone
right now, I guess I'm away,

34:42.732 --> 34:44.995
but I'll try and get back to you
as soon as I can.

34:45.039 --> 34:47.346
-Probably when I'm home.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.330
Two.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.027
Three.

35:17.071 --> 35:18.725
Four.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.771
Five.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.251
Six.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.732
Seven.

35:26.559 --> 35:27.908
Eight.

35:28.778 --> 35:30.215
Nine.

35:30.954 --> 35:32.739
Ten.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.393
Eleven.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.395
Twelve.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.137
Thirteen.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.747
Fourteen.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.663
Fifteen.

35:44.446 --> 35:46.883
Sixteen.

35:46.927 --> 35:48.276
Seventeen.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.931
Eighteen.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.151
Nineteen.

35:54.239 --> 35:56.545
Twenty.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.982
Twenty-one.

35:59.026 --> 36:01.202
Twenty-two.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.596
Twenty-three.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.207
Twenty-four.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.775
Twenty-five.

36:08.818 --> 36:11.560
Twenty-six.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.084
Twenty-seven.

36:14.128 --> 36:16.478
Twenty-eight.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.785
Twenty-nine.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.396
Thirty.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.659
Thirty-one.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.096
Thirty-two.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.751
Thirty-three.

36:28.795 --> 36:31.754
-Thirty-four...

36:31.798 --> 36:33.756
Thirty-five.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.236
Thirty-six.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.369
-Thirty-seven.

36:38.718 --> 36:40.676
Thirty-eight.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.069
Thirty-nine.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.638
Forty.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.922
-You been up all night?
-I couldn't sleep.

38:37.184 --> 38:40.361
What is that? What does it mean?

38:40.405 --> 38:42.320
Have you thought about it?

38:42.363 --> 38:44.757
There's these symbols
above all the doors.

38:45.932 --> 38:48.238
And they're different,
but they're similar, right?

38:48.282 --> 38:51.590
And this... This is on the floor
in the cellar.

38:51.633 --> 38:54.767
It's some kind
of mathematical equation.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.944
We're going to get her back, K.
We are.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.992
She was being bullied.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.692
On her social media.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.826
We didn't even notice.

39:13.176 --> 39:16.136
It's because of me
they think she's a fraud.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.312
They don't agree
with what she stands for

39:18.356 --> 39:20.488
just cos she's different,
doesn't want to follow the pack.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.404
-I swear, those bitches...
-I know, I know, hey.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.406
All we can do is we support her,
OK?

39:25.450 --> 39:27.800
But it makes sense,
why she ran away.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.934
It does. I just wish
she could have talked to us.

39:31.978 --> 39:35.111
I feel so useless. I want to do
something but I don't know what.

39:35.155 --> 39:37.200
She's definitely coming back.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.555
I'm going to have
to go in today.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.688
Yeah, they loved the pitch.

39:46.732 --> 39:48.995
The last thing we need
is the business going under

39:49.038 --> 39:50.518
and us losing everything.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.438
Rob Clayton.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.875
Rob, it's Keira Woods
from the auction.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.225
You'll have to be
a bit more specific, I'm afraid.

40:02.269 --> 40:06.229
-We bought the XAÁOS property.
-Yes. What can I do for you?

40:06.273 --> 40:08.014
We're having some problems
with the house.

40:08.057 --> 40:09.450
I wondered if you had
any information

40:09.494 --> 40:11.452
on the previous owner.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.455
Not much. She's the daughter
of a well-known academic

40:14.499 --> 40:16.457
who owned the house originally.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.895
Do you have a name or a contact?

40:20.505 --> 40:22.681
We only dealt
with her solicitor, I'm afraid.

40:22.724 --> 40:25.814
-But leave it with me.
-OK, thank you.

41:00.980 --> 41:02.590
Erica, I need a favour.

41:05.071 --> 41:07.726
-Shoot.
-I sent you an email.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.467
Oh.

41:10.293 --> 41:13.688
Can you find out what font
or language these are?

41:13.732 --> 41:16.691
-And what they mean?
-Yeah, they look familiar.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.650
-Leave it with me.
-Great.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.218
We're talking about
target demographics,

41:22.262 --> 41:25.134
16 to 19-year-olds with a focus
on leaving cert students...

41:25.178 --> 41:26.919
Congratulations.

41:28.921 --> 41:32.228
We just loved
your Natural Selection campaign.

41:32.272 --> 41:33.708
Thank you.

41:33.752 --> 41:36.102
We had a similar campaign
go viral last year

41:36.145 --> 41:38.278
with the hashtag
"follow your heart".

41:38.321 --> 41:40.498
A wonderful campaign.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.283
We really like the simplicity
of the competition.

41:43.326 --> 41:45.459
Simplicity is key.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.593
I can't remember who said it,
and I am paraphrasing, but...

41:49.376 --> 41:53.293
..the receptivity of the great
masses is very limited...

41:55.513 --> 41:57.950
Their intelligence is small

41:57.993 --> 42:00.822
but their power of forgetting
is enormous.

42:00.866 --> 42:01.823
Nice.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.479
Excuse me.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.096
Hey, Keira.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.664
It's Hebrew,
Hebrew glyphs, to be exact.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.797
So, they don't mean anything
individually

42:18.840 --> 42:21.147
but when I put them
in a certain order,

42:21.190 --> 42:23.628
they spell "leviathan"?

42:24.324 --> 42:26.631
Some sort of sea creature
in Jewish mythology.

42:28.633 --> 42:30.417
Thanks.

42:54.354 --> 42:57.444
-Where's Dad?
-He had to work late.

42:59.359 --> 43:02.797
What happened to your face?
Let me see.

43:02.841 --> 43:06.061
Morgan said Ellie was dead,
so I hit him and he hit me back.

44:37.936 --> 44:40.808
Delta... Point vector...

44:40.852 --> 44:43.028
Sum... Epsilon...

44:43.550 --> 44:46.945
Partial One equals...
One N...

44:46.988 --> 44:48.947
DY by DX...

44:50.644 --> 44:51.776
One.

44:53.865 --> 44:55.388
Two.

44:56.955 --> 44:58.783
Three.

45:00.393 --> 45:02.482
Four.

45:03.309 --> 45:04.702
Five.

45:05.485 --> 45:07.705
Six.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.142
Seven.

45:11.317 --> 45:13.885
Eight.

45:16.757 --> 45:18.324
Nine.

45:20.152 --> 45:21.457
Ten.

45:21.501 --> 45:23.372
Steven!

45:24.199 --> 45:27.028
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

45:27.072 --> 45:29.074
Why are you doing that?
Counting?

45:30.162 --> 45:31.511
Was I?

45:33.556 --> 45:34.906
I thought you were playing
your game.

45:35.689 --> 45:37.299
Y-yeah.

45:37.343 --> 45:38.605
OK.

47:42.642 --> 47:44.296
Mom!

47:44.339 --> 47:45.863
Steven.

47:48.169 --> 47:49.649
Steven?

47:52.391 --> 47:54.610
-Steven?
-Mom, help!

47:54.654 --> 47:58.571
Steven.
What are you doing in there?

47:59.354 --> 48:03.358
-Help, I'm stuck!
-Just a second. I'm right here.

48:05.839 --> 48:08.015
Hang on a second.

48:08.059 --> 48:10.888
Wait. Steven?

48:10.931 --> 48:13.455
-Do you have the key?
-No.

48:13.499 --> 48:16.110
-The lock is jammed.
-It's dark, Mom, I'm scared.

48:16.154 --> 48:17.720
Hang on, I'm right here,
just outside.

48:18.547 --> 48:19.897
Hang on.

48:28.166 --> 48:29.732
Steven.

48:30.995 --> 48:32.997
Steven!

48:33.040 --> 48:35.521
Who are you talking to?

48:35.564 --> 48:38.350
-Where were you?
-I fell asleep in the playroom.

48:38.393 --> 48:41.483
-It's all right. OK.
-What's happening?

48:41.527 --> 48:44.182
-I thought I heard something.

48:44.225 --> 48:45.531
Shush.

48:46.271 --> 48:49.535
-Don't move.

49:27.399 --> 49:30.271
-Mom.

49:32.317 --> 49:33.927
Stay there.

49:44.285 --> 49:45.765
Mom!

49:46.940 --> 49:48.898
Steven!

49:48.942 --> 49:50.770
-Steven!
-It's stuck.

49:50.813 --> 49:52.119
I can't get it open.

50:21.496 --> 50:23.020
Steven!

50:24.804 --> 50:27.502
Steven, try pulling on the door.

50:27.546 --> 50:28.677
I am!

50:31.289 --> 50:33.117
The key!
What about the key?

50:38.339 --> 50:40.254
I can't reach it.
I need to get a chair.

50:40.298 --> 50:41.734
Hurry up!

50:46.304 --> 50:47.914
Hurry up!

50:50.090 --> 50:53.006
-That's it.

50:54.747 --> 50:57.489
Steven! Hurry!

51:01.145 --> 51:03.930
-I still can't get it to work.

51:18.945 --> 51:23.341
-One, two, three...

51:26.866 --> 51:28.824
-Steve, what's up?
-Dad!

51:28.868 --> 51:30.870
Mom's stuck
and I can't get her out.

51:33.046 --> 51:34.178
Brian.

51:57.157 --> 51:59.942
He's asleep, finally.

52:00.813 --> 52:03.598
What happened, K?

52:03.642 --> 52:05.905
The lights went out
and I got stuck in the cellar.

52:07.559 --> 52:09.430
There was something in there.

52:11.476 --> 52:13.652
-Something?
-Yeah, I heard something.

52:15.567 --> 52:18.570
It was in there with me.
A presence.

52:20.920 --> 52:23.314
Take a look. I dropped my phone.
It fell down the steps.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.186
It's not there any more.
It disappeared.

52:26.230 --> 52:28.232
I'm sure your phone
is still there.

52:28.275 --> 52:30.364
I also found out about the
family that used to live here.

52:30.408 --> 52:32.323
The Fetherstons.

52:33.759 --> 52:36.283
They all went missing, all
of them except their daughter.

52:37.415 --> 52:40.592
Missing, Brian. Just like Ellie.

52:40.635 --> 52:43.116
-What are you trying to tell me?
-I don't know!

52:43.160 --> 52:45.074
I just know that our daughter is
missing and something very wrong

52:45.118 --> 52:47.251
is happening in the place
that she disappeared.

52:50.471 --> 52:52.560
I'm going to go look
for your phone.

52:52.604 --> 52:55.259
-OK?

54:02.326 --> 54:04.806
Come in.

54:09.855 --> 54:11.813
I'm sorry,
I'm looking for Dr Fournet.

54:11.857 --> 54:14.294
-Who are you?
-Keira Woods.

54:14.338 --> 54:17.819
-I made an appointment with...
-What can I do for you?

54:17.863 --> 54:19.430
Um...

54:30.267 --> 54:32.312
Where did you get this?

54:32.356 --> 54:34.401
I bought John Fetherston's
family home.

54:35.446 --> 54:37.883
It was engraved on the floor
in the cellar.

54:40.320 --> 54:47.240
"Delta point vector sum epsilon
partial I equals 1N DY by DX."

54:51.810 --> 54:56.728
Call me Remi, please. I haven't
got used to this doctor thing.

54:56.771 --> 55:01.036
You see, I was in a car crash
and a bang to the head

55:01.080 --> 55:03.909
changed the parts of my brain
we don't usually use

55:03.952 --> 55:07.173
and...
well, now I'm a bloody genius!

55:10.307 --> 55:12.439
How does that work?

55:12.483 --> 55:15.224
Before the accident I could
barely add double numbers.

55:15.268 --> 55:17.575
But afterwards,

55:17.618 --> 55:20.752
I began to understand
the language of mathematics.

55:20.795 --> 55:22.536
I began to see patterns
in everything

55:22.580 --> 55:25.147
and somehow make sense
of the universe.

55:25.191 --> 55:27.585
That's my magic trick.

55:27.628 --> 55:30.065
I'm able to visualise
mathematical structures.

55:30.109 --> 55:33.286
That's pi,
that's Hawking radiation

55:33.330 --> 55:35.201
and that's a quantum star.

55:39.771 --> 55:42.774
Who was he, Fetherston?

55:42.817 --> 55:45.733
Well... You're standing
in his old office.

55:45.777 --> 55:48.736
He was a colleague
of Erwin Schroödinger.

55:48.780 --> 55:51.870
-Nobel Prize winner
-Cat in a box.

55:52.827 --> 55:55.700
-Yes, the cat.
-Yeah, I never understood it.

55:57.310 --> 55:59.094
It's simply his way
of illustrating

55:59.138 --> 56:02.315
the misrepresentation
of having quantum particles

56:02.359 --> 56:04.317
existing in two states.

56:06.972 --> 56:10.454
The cat in the box
is either dead or alive.

56:10.497 --> 56:13.935
We can't tell until we open
the box to observe it.

56:13.979 --> 56:16.982
So, until we do so,
the cat is both dead and alive.

56:21.987 --> 56:24.163
-I'm sorry, did I say something?
-No, no.

56:26.557 --> 56:29.298
My daughter is missing, so...

56:29.342 --> 56:30.996
I'm very sorry to hear that.

56:31.736 --> 56:33.868
Please continue.

56:33.912 --> 56:37.611
Well, Schroödinger came
to Ireland in the '40s

56:37.655 --> 56:41.528
to escape the Nazis and work on
his unified field theory here.

56:41.572 --> 56:45.445
Fetherston worked closely with
him until his son became ill

56:45.489 --> 56:47.795
and he disappeared
from academic circles.

56:47.839 --> 56:50.494
Completely disappeared?
I mean, does anyone know what
happened to him?

56:50.537 --> 56:52.060
No. It's a mystery.

56:52.104 --> 56:54.367
He has a daughter, Rose,

56:54.411 --> 56:56.630
who you must have purchased
the house from.

56:56.674 --> 56:59.328
I don't think
she ever recovered.

56:59.372 --> 57:01.679
Never really spoke
about what happened.

57:02.680 --> 57:06.988
I can't visualise this yet but
at first glance, your problem,

57:07.032 --> 57:10.557
your equation is definitely a
representation for a dimension.

57:10.601 --> 57:12.559
Or dimensions.

57:12.603 --> 57:14.169
There seems to be one variable

57:14.213 --> 57:16.520
that's interchangeable
for each dimension.

57:16.563 --> 57:19.131
It's incredibly complex, like
nothing I've ever seen before.

57:20.959 --> 57:23.396
Can you leave it with me
and I'll come back to you?

57:23.440 --> 57:25.311
That would be great. Thank you.

57:52.164 --> 57:54.775
-Hi.

58:01.086 --> 58:02.870
Hello, Keira Woods.

58:02.914 --> 58:05.699
Keira, it's Remi Fournet here.

58:05.743 --> 58:08.223
-Is everything OK?
-Yes, why?

58:08.267 --> 58:10.312
I called you a few times and...

58:10.356 --> 58:13.446
Oh, you know, I lost my phone. I
just managed to replace it now.

58:13.490 --> 58:16.144
That's strange.
Someone answered.

58:16.188 --> 58:19.147
-What did they say?
-It was counting.

58:19.191 --> 58:21.933
Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

58:23.021 --> 58:25.458
I wasn't sure if you were OK
or what was going on.

58:26.764 --> 58:28.374
-Keira?
-No, I'm OK.

58:29.114 --> 58:31.159
I wanted to let you know

58:31.203 --> 58:33.901
that I spoke to a colleague in
France about your equation.

58:33.945 --> 58:36.643
He seems to think it's related
to a branch of mathematics

58:36.687 --> 58:39.820
created by alchemists
in the 12th century.

58:39.864 --> 58:42.431
He likened it to more
of an incomplete sequence

58:42.475 --> 58:44.956
or an unfinished incantation.

58:46.305 --> 58:48.612
It's a very peculiar sequence
and it does seem to refer

58:48.655 --> 58:51.528
to dimensions,
but it's incomplete, as I said.

58:51.571 --> 58:53.442
Sorry I can't be more help.

58:53.486 --> 58:55.793
Well, thank you
for looking into it for me.

58:55.836 --> 58:58.099
There is one other piece
of information.

58:58.143 --> 59:00.275
My colleague has come across
a similar one

59:00.319 --> 59:02.451
engraved in a house in Belgium.

59:02.495 --> 59:04.671
An infamous house, actually,

59:04.715 --> 59:08.196
where a family went missing,
vanished into thin air.

59:10.329 --> 59:12.070
Keira?

59:12.810 --> 59:14.942
Keira?

59:21.645 --> 59:24.212
-Steve, I'm gonna talk to Mom.
-OK.

59:28.521 --> 59:30.741
-Hey, are you good?
-Yeah.

59:50.543 --> 59:52.110
I've emailed these to you.

59:53.546 --> 59:55.679
These are the engravings
above the door.

59:55.722 --> 59:58.203
They're Hebrew.
They mean "leviathan".

59:58.246 --> 1:00:01.249
Like I said, I don't know
what these triangles represent

1:00:01.293 --> 1:00:03.817
but the letters, this is what
they mean, look what it says.

1:00:03.861 --> 1:00:05.732
The abyss.

1:00:05.776 --> 1:00:08.169
Fetherston, the man who owned
the place, called it XAÁOS,

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:10.998
Greek for chaos,
the void before time, the abyss.

1:00:11.042 --> 1:00:13.174
You're making huge leaps
and connections between things

1:00:13.218 --> 1:00:15.002
that are completely unrelated.

1:00:15.046 --> 1:00:18.615
I could tell you that your name
Keira in Greek means Dark Lord

1:00:18.658 --> 1:00:20.529
and you're connected to this.

1:00:20.573 --> 1:00:23.707
-That's ridiculous!
-It also means dark-haired.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:25.534
You get my point?

1:00:25.578 --> 1:00:28.102
Look, the guy who owned this
house was an obsessed academic.

1:00:28.146 --> 1:00:30.191
All of this, it's decorative.

1:00:30.235 --> 1:00:32.759
It doesn't mean anything.

1:00:32.803 --> 1:00:35.544
You know better than anyone
that everything has a meaning.

1:00:35.588 --> 1:00:37.546
Every image, every word
is doing something.

1:00:37.590 --> 1:00:39.592
These are pieces in a puzzle,
can't you see that?

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:42.682
So, what are you suggesting?
What do all these symbols mean?

1:00:42.726 --> 1:00:45.076
I don't know yet. I've got
to show you something.

1:00:57.436 --> 1:01:00.657
Look. You see? Each step
is numbered, one to ten.

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:04.965
What about this? Look.

1:01:47.486 --> 1:01:49.488
I met with a physics
professor today.

1:01:49.531 --> 1:01:51.751
He thinks it's a formula
to a different dimension.

1:01:51.795 --> 1:01:54.014
-Another place, Brian.
-Keira.

1:01:54.058 --> 1:01:56.364
This is delusional thinking.

1:01:56.408 --> 1:01:59.150
The same equation was found
in another home in Belgium,

1:01:59.193 --> 1:02:01.761
where another family
went missing.

1:02:01.805 --> 1:02:04.198
This is our way to get her back,
I know it.

1:02:04.242 --> 1:02:06.548
Please, Brian, I need your help.

1:02:08.812 --> 1:02:10.422
No.

1:02:38.624 --> 1:02:41.888
Brian! What are you doing?

1:02:44.891 --> 1:02:46.458
Stop!

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.562
One...

1:03:04.215 --> 1:03:06.173
Two...

1:03:06.217 --> 1:03:07.392
Three...

1:03:24.278 --> 1:03:26.628
Ellie?

1:03:30.284 --> 1:03:32.156
Mom! Dad!

1:03:33.418 --> 1:03:35.115
Steven.

1:03:40.773 --> 1:03:43.080
-What?
-There's something in there.

1:03:43.123 --> 1:03:44.908
It looks like Ellie.

1:03:50.609 --> 1:03:54.178
Ten... Ten... Ten... Ten...

1:04:02.360 --> 1:04:03.796
It's Ellie's.

1:04:18.637 --> 1:04:21.161
Hi, Keira. Rob Clayton here.

1:04:21.205 --> 1:04:24.338
I've tracked down
Rose Fetherston.

1:04:24.382 --> 1:04:26.863
She's in a private nursing home
called St Anthony's.

1:04:26.906 --> 1:04:29.343
I'll put you in touch
with her carer, Ruth Collins.

1:04:59.330 --> 1:05:03.769
-Hi. Thank you for meeting.
-Rose agreed to it.

1:05:04.857 --> 1:05:08.208
She's inside.
She finds it peaceful here.

1:05:09.993 --> 1:05:12.386
-She doesn't speak much.
-OK.

1:05:12.430 --> 1:05:13.779
Thank you.

1:05:36.062 --> 1:05:37.890
Hello, Rose.

1:05:41.894 --> 1:05:45.550
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Keira.

1:05:49.597 --> 1:05:51.643
My family moved into your house.

1:05:53.253 --> 1:05:55.255
And now my daughter is missing.

1:05:57.954 --> 1:06:00.782
I came here to ask you
about your father.

1:06:07.050 --> 1:06:08.747
And about the cellar.

1:06:14.622 --> 1:06:17.886
I know you've lost your family.
I know what that's like.

1:06:17.930 --> 1:06:20.367
I've lost my daughter, so if
there's something that you know,

1:06:20.411 --> 1:06:22.761
will you please, please tell me?

1:06:29.028 --> 1:06:30.247
Leviathan!

1:06:30.290 --> 1:06:31.465
Yes.

1:06:36.427 --> 1:06:38.429
One of the seven
princes of hell.

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:43.651
What is it?

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:47.351
That isn't its name.

1:06:48.961 --> 1:06:52.008
Whose name? Rose, tell me.

1:06:53.792 --> 1:06:56.273
My father brought it
into our world.

1:06:57.970 --> 1:06:59.580
Your father? He was a scientist.

1:06:59.624 --> 1:07:03.497
He was, until my brother Jack
got sick

1:07:03.541 --> 1:07:05.282
and science couldn't help him.

1:07:07.327 --> 1:07:09.112
It's OK.

1:07:09.155 --> 1:07:11.288
Please take your time.

1:07:12.332 --> 1:07:16.989
Mathematics are supposed
to make sense of the universe,

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:19.513
to make order from chaos.

1:07:21.994 --> 1:07:24.431
But all he succeeded in doing

1:07:24.475 --> 1:07:26.825
was bringing darkness
into the world.

1:07:27.695 --> 1:07:33.310
A darkness that has existed
since before the universe began.

1:07:35.138 --> 1:07:37.009
Something ancient.

1:07:38.706 --> 1:07:43.276
Something that has been known...
by many names.

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:46.105
Where is my daughter?
Is she still in the cellar?

1:07:46.149 --> 1:07:49.587
It's not just the cellar.
It's the whole house!

1:08:46.383 --> 1:08:48.515
Hello, Keira...

1:08:48.559 --> 1:08:50.082
One...

1:08:51.083 --> 1:08:53.694
Two...

1:08:53.738 --> 1:08:55.392
Three...

1:10:18.301 --> 1:10:19.954
Hey.

1:10:19.998 --> 1:10:21.695
Look at this.

1:10:24.829 --> 1:10:28.180
These are the shapes
from over the doors, OK?

1:10:30.008 --> 1:10:32.663
Five acute triangles.

1:10:32.706 --> 1:10:34.317
And a pentagon.

1:10:36.841 --> 1:10:38.886
OK, and there's more.

1:10:48.896 --> 1:10:52.726
Leviathan the sea
serpent is misdirection.

1:10:57.209 --> 1:11:00.256
These are the Hebrew glyphs
over the five points.

1:11:06.087 --> 1:11:07.567
Look.

1:11:13.356 --> 1:11:14.966
Baphomet.

1:11:16.359 --> 1:11:19.492
It's some sort of demon

1:11:19.536 --> 1:11:22.539
that the occultists and
the Knights Templar worshipped.

1:11:22.582 --> 1:11:25.063
Some sort of gatekeeper
or soldier in hell.

1:11:29.807 --> 1:11:33.158
-An ancient evil.
-Look, look at the fingers.

1:11:33.941 --> 1:11:36.727
Just like in the painting.
And there.

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:41.297
Solve Coagula?

1:11:42.428 --> 1:11:44.822
This whole house has been
designed around it.

1:12:24.644 --> 1:12:26.472
Schroödinger's cat.

1:12:26.516 --> 1:12:29.214
That's Ellie - neither dead
nor alive until we find her.

1:12:37.962 --> 1:12:41.357
-Delta... Point vector...
-What's that?

1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:43.750
Sum... Epsilon...

1:12:43.794 --> 1:12:46.797
Partial One equals... 1N...

1:12:48.059 --> 1:12:50.540
DY by DX...

1:12:52.455 --> 1:12:54.152
-One...
-One.

1:12:55.327 --> 1:12:58.156
-Two.
-Two.

1:12:58.199 --> 1:13:00.680
That's the mathematical equation
on the cellar floor.

1:13:00.724 --> 1:13:02.682
I'm positive it's Fetherston.

1:13:02.726 --> 1:13:05.381
-He's reading it out loud.
-But what does that mean?

1:13:06.207 --> 1:13:08.732
-I think it opens the box.
- Seven...

1:13:10.386 --> 1:13:11.865
Eight...

1:13:16.043 --> 1:13:17.480
Nine...

1:13:21.571 --> 1:13:23.311
Ten...

1:13:23.355 --> 1:13:26.010
Eleven... Twelve...

1:14:16.408 --> 1:14:18.236
-Steven!

1:14:23.981 --> 1:14:25.635
Steven?

1:14:36.907 --> 1:14:38.343
Brian.

1:14:51.922 --> 1:14:54.185
Check upstairs.

1:15:05.457 --> 1:15:06.937
Steven?

1:15:28.785 --> 1:15:30.700
He's gone.

1:16:02.906 --> 1:16:06.562
Forty-one...
Forty-two...

1:16:07.345 --> 1:16:11.001
-Forty-three... Forty-four...
-Shush.

1:16:11.044 --> 1:16:14.004
Forty-five... Forty-six...

1:16:14.047 --> 1:16:15.658
Do you hear that?

1:16:25.015 --> 1:16:26.756
Steven!

1:16:30.716 --> 1:16:32.196
Carry him, quickly.

1:16:43.381 --> 1:16:45.818
-Take this off.

1:16:45.862 --> 1:16:49.082
He's so hot. Come on, Steven.
You're OK.

1:16:50.562 --> 1:16:53.391
-What happened?
-Nothing. You're safe now.

1:16:55.219 --> 1:16:57.351
-I'm thirsty.
-I'll get him some water.

1:16:57.395 --> 1:16:59.658
Tell me, Steven.
Did you see Ellie?

1:16:59.702 --> 1:17:01.573
I don't know.

1:17:02.313 --> 1:17:04.707
-I can't remember.
-It's OK. I'm sorry.

1:17:07.579 --> 1:17:09.668
You're so hot.

1:17:09.712 --> 1:17:11.888
Here, let me take this off.

1:17:16.762 --> 1:17:18.634
What is it?

1:17:20.287 --> 1:17:21.724
Nothing.

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:29.993
-I remember.
-What do you remember?

1:17:30.994 --> 1:17:34.258
I rode the beast
with seven heads and ten horns.

1:17:39.524 --> 1:17:41.526
Fifty... Forty-nine...

1:17:42.832 --> 1:17:45.051
-Forty-eight...
-Brian!

1:17:45.095 --> 1:17:46.836
Forty-seven... Forty-six...

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:50.274
Brian. Brian.

1:17:51.362 --> 1:17:56.236
Forty-three... Forty-two...
Forty-one... Forty...

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:58.412
Brian!

1:18:11.295 --> 1:18:14.646
Twenty... Nineteen...
Eighteen...

1:18:14.690 --> 1:18:16.343
Stop it!

1:18:17.649 --> 1:18:20.391
Please, Brian. Come back to me.

1:18:22.393 --> 1:18:24.482
Ten... Nine...

1:18:24.525 --> 1:18:26.832
Eight... Seven...

1:18:26.876 --> 1:18:29.139
Six... Five...

1:18:29.182 --> 1:18:31.968
Four... Three... Two...

1:18:32.011 --> 1:18:33.665
One.

1:18:34.492 --> 1:18:36.146
It's here.

1:20:09.892 --> 1:20:11.154
Ellie!

1:23:38.970 --> 1:23:41.755
..five billion, two million,

1:23:41.799 --> 1:23:43.670
seven hundred and two thousand
and one...

1:24:37.202 --> 1:24:39.117
..three million
and twenty-two...

1:24:39.161 --> 1:24:41.641
three million
and twenty-three...

1:24:41.685 --> 1:24:44.514
three million and twenty-four...

1:24:44.557 --> 1:24:46.342
Ellie.

1:24:47.517 --> 1:24:49.171
Ellie.

1:24:52.217 --> 1:24:54.959
Ellie! Ellie, it's Mom!

1:24:58.093 --> 1:24:59.920
Can you see me?

1:25:00.704 --> 1:25:03.315
Come on, Ellie. You don't have
to count any more.

1:25:03.359 --> 1:25:05.404
It's OK. Come on.

1:25:08.146 --> 1:25:10.757
I got you. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

1:25:49.231 --> 1:25:51.407
Come on.
Come on, it's all right.

1:26:17.607 --> 1:26:20.784
-You're not coming in!

1:26:20.827 --> 1:26:23.265
-You're not taking my family!

1:26:45.374 --> 1:26:47.419
Brian.

1:26:47.463 --> 1:26:50.814
-You found Ellie!
-Yes. Get Steven.

1:26:51.684 --> 1:26:53.295
Get Steven.

1:26:55.210 --> 1:26:56.298
Mom.

1:27:00.824 --> 1:27:02.478
I never stopped trying, Ellie.

1:27:05.176 --> 1:27:07.961
I never stopped
looking for you.

1:27:08.005 --> 1:27:09.702
I know.

1:27:14.316 --> 1:27:17.188
-Ellie?
-OK, we gotta go.

1:27:17.232 --> 1:27:19.669
C'mon, let's go. Let's go.

1:27:54.617 --> 1:27:56.271
-One...
-Two...

1:27:57.533 --> 1:27:59.491
Three...

1:27:59.535 --> 1:28:03.495
Four... Five... Six...

1:28:03.539 --> 1:28:06.411
Seven... Eight...

1:28:06.455 --> 1:28:09.240
Nine... Ten...

1:28:21.905 --> 1:28:24.516
Nineteen... Twenty...

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:27.780
Twenty-one... Twenty-two...

1:28:27.824 --> 1:28:30.305
Twenty-three... Twenty-four...
