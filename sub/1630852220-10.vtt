01:30.280 --> 01:34.918
<i>In the Bay of Naples, a few kilometers
from Pompeii and Vesuvius,</i>

01:34.920 --> 01:38.918
<i>lies the world's most surprising
underwater archeological site.</i>

01:38.920 --> 01:42.360
<i>Here is the lost Roman city of Baia.</i>

01:44.640 --> 01:49.118
<i>Since the first century BC
it has been an exclusive place...</i>

01:49.120 --> 01:52.240
See the lovely parmigiana
Mom made for you?

02:03.160 --> 02:06.720
Patrizia, will you tell me
what's the matter?

02:09.000 --> 02:12.600
Last night I saw
a documentary about bees.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.760
The males do nothing
from morning till night.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.560
They only wake up
when the Queen sends for them.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.520
They mate in flight for safety.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.160
And they fuck so much
that their balls explode.

02:43.520 --> 02:45.160
And then they die.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.078
One after another,

02:50.080 --> 02:53.000
'cause they're no good
for anything anymore.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.800
That's all they can do.

04:12.040 --> 04:16.878
From the samples you brought from Milan,
I see you do elegant stuff.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.920
What's the retail price? 1,200?

04:20.959 --> 04:24.160
You sell them to retailers at 500 max.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.238
Once you buy fabric,
pay seamstresses, packing, shipping,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.360
you're left with 10%, right?

04:34.200 --> 04:35.878
Right.

04:35.880 --> 04:38.280
Go with us
and your earnings will triple.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.278
And how?

04:43.280 --> 04:47.918
Our labor costs are low:
two or three euros an hour.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.760
It depends what their work's like.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.838
You only have to decide, Evelina.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.318
You can work with subcontractors
in your area that cost more

04:58.320 --> 05:01.878
and won't do an hour of overtime
for love or money,

05:01.880 --> 05:04.880
or you can make real money with us.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.398
- The paper pattern?
- I only have them for the samples.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.158
- You'll do patterns and size-charts.
- No problem... Fabric?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.600
I'll courier it all to you tomorrow.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.760
- Dad, I got A in math!
- Well done!

06:41.760 --> 06:43.558
What's the matter?

06:43.560 --> 06:46.438
- You take a bath in perfume?
- You don't like it?

06:46.440 --> 06:50.600
I like it, on a woman, though.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.640
Let's go wash our hands,
dinner is ready.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.360
Well done, Daddy's little scholar.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.758
How did the checkup go?
Is the baby growing?

07:14.760 --> 07:17.000
- Everything's good.
- And Patrizia?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.680
She decided to have a rest.

07:21.760 --> 07:26.440
Good, if only
she'd give it a rest for real.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.198
What's happening
in Central Naples is no good,

07:34.200 --> 07:37.440
and if the problem spreads
it'll weaken Secondigliano.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.198
And to keep helping a weak clan

07:43.200 --> 07:44.520
is too risky.

07:46.120 --> 07:50.078
I don't think Patrizia's fit
to rule right now.

07:50.080 --> 07:52.720
You're her husband,
make her see reason.

07:54.840 --> 07:57.998
Now she has two options:

07:58.000 --> 08:00.438
be a woman or a commander.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.318
I'd like to know
what it is that you want,

08:03.320 --> 08:06.798
if you want to raise a kid

08:06.800 --> 08:09.240
or you want to mourn your wife.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.278
Now let's eat, I'm starved.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.518
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.958
Lord, bless this food.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.438
Our Father...

08:26.440 --> 08:30.520
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

08:58.040 --> 09:00.160
The Levantes are behind the bust.

09:01.520 --> 09:04.120
They want to take Secondigliano.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.160
They blamed Nicola and killed him.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.678
Now they're hand in hand
with the Graduate,

09:12.680 --> 09:16.160
who took everything
that was Blue Blood's.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.120
My husband's one of them, Gennaro.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.600
And you didn't notice
anything, Patrizia?

09:39.640 --> 09:42.278
I told you: a boss can never
trust anyone.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.080
- I know.
- Doesn't look like it.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
What are you going to do?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.918
I can only do two things.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.400
Be a wife and mother and leave
everything to the Levantes.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.800
Or I wipe out every last one of them.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.080
I handed over a kingdom to you.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.920
Mine, the Savastanos'.

10:27.240 --> 10:30.398
And you're still here
asking me which way to go.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.280
No, Gennaro.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.680
You're wrong.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.400
I just wanted you to know.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.160
This is my house.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.120
And in my house I call the shots.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.398
OUR BROTHERS

11:39.400 --> 11:42.278
You're nuts coming here.

11:42.280 --> 11:45.118
You know the Capaccios
run Forcella now.

11:45.120 --> 11:49.640
Since you killed his brother,
the Graduate's looking all over for you.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.880
I could have put it here for you.

12:05.800 --> 12:07.840
I'm the one who needs to be pardoned.

12:18.840 --> 12:21.438
I know what you're risking,
Pure'n'Simple,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.920
but you gotta set up a meeting
for me with our most trusted guys.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.080
You got it.

13:54.280 --> 13:56.080
How do you feel?

13:57.360 --> 13:59.600
I managed to get some rest.

14:16.640 --> 14:19.878
I had to make a decision
before talking to you.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.480
And I've made it.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.920
I have to think about
our Bianca first.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.240
It's best if I hand over the command
of Secondigliano to you.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.520
Bianca?

14:44.480 --> 14:46.360
That was my mother's name.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.880
We'll do whatever you want, sweetheart.

15:58.480 --> 16:01.480
This place is like a jail.

16:02.680 --> 16:07.320
But if Patrizia hadn't given us
a crash pad, by now we'd be dead.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.720
I don't want to mourn you.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.720
I can't stop now.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.600
First I gotta avenge our brothers.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.360
You building a tower?

17:04.240 --> 17:07.478
Things aren't going well, Azzurra.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.598
Secondigliano's about to blow up.

17:09.599 --> 17:14.400
- That's not our problem.
- Yes, it is.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.599
When things are going well,
we're all friends.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.397
But when things get outta balance,

17:22.400 --> 17:25.160
who knows what could happen.

17:30.120 --> 17:34.838
You put Patrizia there, for a reason:

17:34.840 --> 17:37.520
to buy us our freedom.

18:20.425 --> 18:24.383
I hadn't heard the news.
Congratulations.

18:24.385 --> 18:27.825
- Thank you. So, how are things?
- Good.

18:31.705 --> 18:35.385
Igor, for the moment, I can't
personally handle the shipments.

18:36.425 --> 18:39.505
My husband Michelangelo
will handle them.

18:44.705 --> 18:47.025
Talk to him like you talk to me.

19:46.945 --> 19:48.305
One.

19:53.465 --> 19:55.065
One.

20:00.545 --> 20:02.225
Gimme twenty.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.785
Morning, Don Michelangelo. Please.

21:21.905 --> 21:25.223
We're done here, Donna Patrizia.
It's 213 grand.

21:25.225 --> 21:28.385
In line with last week,
maybe a bit more.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.905
This isn't a neighborhood.

21:47.745 --> 21:50.105
It's a city within a bigger city.

21:52.985 --> 21:55.865
Secondigliano doesn't answer to anyone.

22:01.185 --> 22:03.345
Enzo came to me.

22:06.385 --> 22:08.385
He loathes everyone.

22:09.825 --> 22:13.023
He says that your family's
behind the bust

22:13.025 --> 22:14.745
and now he asks for my help.

22:17.345 --> 22:19.625
He wants to kill you all.

22:21.065 --> 22:23.385
Why didn't you tell me straightaway?

22:24.545 --> 22:26.545
Because I had doubts.

22:28.345 --> 22:30.025
About me?

22:31.625 --> 22:33.265
Yeah.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.305
And now it's gone?

22:42.345 --> 22:44.345
No.

22:50.105 --> 22:52.225
But I've made a choice.

22:55.265 --> 22:57.265
Enzo's here...

22:59.265 --> 23:01.505
But you gotta make me a promise.

23:02.865 --> 23:08.425
You gotta make a choice,
like I did, and remove all doubt.

23:58.665 --> 24:00.625
Enzo...

24:04.305 --> 24:06.105
What have you done, bro'?

24:12.545 --> 24:15.065
Check out the hair.

24:17.105 --> 24:19.145
Hey, Enzo.

24:25.305 --> 24:27.185
I'm glad to see you.

24:44.105 --> 24:48.425
Patrizia and I have
the same enemy: the Levantes.

24:50.065 --> 24:52.783
First they used
the Capaccios like puppets,

24:52.785 --> 24:55.303
then they took our turf.

24:55.305 --> 24:57.545
We gotta hide to talk.

24:59.785 --> 25:02.343
They better not think
I've forgotten them.

25:02.345 --> 25:04.625
I think about them all the time.

25:08.825 --> 25:10.545
Night and day...

25:12.785 --> 25:14.625
All the time.

25:16.505 --> 25:18.945
What do you got in mind, Enzo?

26:06.905 --> 26:09.385
Patrizia just wants to be a mom.

26:11.825 --> 26:14.105
She's made up her mind.

26:15.905 --> 26:18.743
And she's handed everything over to me.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.745
Shipping, dealing spots...

26:21.905 --> 26:23.305
Secondigliano.

26:27.185 --> 26:31.825
She handed it over to me, Dad,
not to you.

26:42.785 --> 26:45.105
You never liked this place.

26:46.665 --> 26:51.465
You never came here to work,
but our family's fortune starts here.

26:56.145 --> 26:57.825
Michelangelo...

27:02.945 --> 27:05.623
To make concrete

27:05.625 --> 27:08.185
you need to mix sand with cement.

27:09.665 --> 27:13.983
And what comes out is a new substance,

27:13.985 --> 27:16.303
that belongs to us,

27:16.305 --> 27:18.705
it belongs to our family.

27:21.345 --> 27:25.225
You and Patrizia are like
sand and cement.

27:29.065 --> 27:34.625
You've become a substance
that can build something very big.

27:36.185 --> 27:40.665
And if you understand it,
so does she.

27:42.745 --> 27:44.585
You're right, Dad.

27:47.105 --> 27:49.545
There's something else
we have to settle.

27:51.025 --> 27:53.185
We have to kill Blue Blood.

28:44.145 --> 28:48.025
- Well?
- It's good, I like it.

29:58.665 --> 30:00.583
Thanks for coming, guys.

30:00.585 --> 30:03.225
They told us you'd retired.

30:12.345 --> 30:15.663
Maybe it's time for me
to get back to work.

30:15.665 --> 30:18.625
We missed you, Don Gennaro.

30:21.185 --> 30:22.905
Let's go.

31:30.025 --> 31:31.545
Go, go!

31:39.305 --> 31:41.065
There's no one here.

31:46.945 --> 31:49.345
Run, it's a trap! Sons of bitches!

34:49.185 --> 34:50.862
You pieces of shit!

34:50.864 --> 34:53.105
Guys, after him!

35:42.985 --> 35:44.465
Mom?

35:45.865 --> 35:48.905
I'm fine, why? What's happened?

35:50.665 --> 35:52.345
Calm down, Mom.

35:54.305 --> 35:56.105
What are you saying?

35:57.225 --> 35:59.065
And how are they?

36:00.705 --> 36:02.785
The main thing is that they're okay.

36:05.465 --> 36:07.225
I'll be right there.

36:14.985 --> 36:16.705
We failed.

37:41.705 --> 37:43.865
Good evening, Don Gennaro.

37:48.465 --> 37:52.183
Mistral's sorry,
but he couldn't come to the meeting.

37:52.185 --> 37:54.745
- He sent his regards.
- Don't worry about it.

37:55.905 --> 37:59.345
I know what it means
to live on high alert.

38:03.665 --> 38:06.903
With all due respect,

38:06.905 --> 38:10.503
we thought you'd retired
from our business.

38:10.505 --> 38:13.023
Or am I wrong?

38:13.025 --> 38:15.743
It's true.

38:15.745 --> 38:18.745
But now I've got money,
contacts and skills.

38:20.025 --> 38:23.545
Above all, I need to take back
everything that's mine.

38:26.985 --> 38:29.185
Excuse me, if you'll allow me...

38:33.065 --> 38:36.665
Can I ask you something Mistral
would have asked for sure?

38:39.105 --> 38:41.025
Go ahead.

38:42.305 --> 38:44.825
Why did you choose him?

38:46.905 --> 38:50.065
The next war's gonna be long and hard.

38:51.985 --> 38:55.543
And a man who had the guts to eat
his enemy's heart in prison

38:55.545 --> 38:57.385
is a man who'll do anything.

38:58.465 --> 39:01.705
And I need someone like that
to win this war.

39:03.065 --> 39:05.265
But that's water under the bridge.

39:06.665 --> 39:09.983
After that, he did 20 years
of maximum security

39:09.985 --> 39:13.625
and his friends all turned
their backs on him.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.305
I know.

39:25.065 --> 39:30.383
But I also know that he once had
enormous ambition

39:30.385 --> 39:33.385
and that's something that never dies.
