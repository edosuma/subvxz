We got freakin' gold
coming our way, man,

00:20.601 --> 00:22.159

the freakin' effort

00:22.234 --> 00:24.559
and the work for this.

00:24.561 --> 00:26.399
[Dustin] If you guys thought
that journey was hard,

00:26.474 --> 00:27.879
wait till we start diggin'.

00:27.954 --> 00:29.559
This is going to be
the hardest thing

00:29.561 --> 00:30.879
we've ever done.

00:30.881 --> 00:32.559
So, y'all ready
for a challenge?

00:32.561 --> 00:33.759
-[Kayla] Yeah.
-[man] Yup.

00:33.761 --> 00:35.199
All right. Let's build camp.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.479
Let's get the dredges ready.
Let's go find a spot to dig.

00:38.481 --> 00:40.439
We got a lot of work to do

00:40.441 --> 00:43.959
and we don't have
a whole bunch of time
to do it.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.519
I want to be digging soon

00:45.521 --> 00:47.759
to pay for all
of this adventure.

00:47.834 --> 00:49.559
We need to get up
into that creek up there

00:49.601 --> 00:51.119
and go find some gold.

00:51.121 --> 00:52.599

This is the start of all that
and I'm excited for it.

10:24.434 --> 10:27.119

10:41.881 --> 10:43.319
waking up
early in the morning,

10:43.361 --> 10:46.079
diving for gold,
doesn't seem so bad.

10:46.154 --> 10:48.919
<i> I hope to God that there is</i>
<i> so much gold in there</i>

10:48.921 --> 10:51.399

all of this worthwhile.

the water here is steeper

11:34.241 --> 11:36.199
[tense music playing]

11:53.481 --> 11:56.719
[tense music playing]

12:01.001 --> 12:03.919
Right now,
I'm gonna go up the creek

See what we're getting into.
It may just shut us down.

12:07.121 --> 12:09.079
It could be that
we just get there

12:09.081 --> 12:10.119
and we can't go anywhere.

12:10.121 --> 12:11.239
The water might be too hot.

12:22.874 --> 12:24.519
That's where all
this gear comes in.

12:24.521 --> 12:26.119
If you guys would go look
for some gold,

12:26.121 --> 12:28.279
see what the gold content
might be in the sides

12:28.281 --> 12:29.679
and the edges
and behind the big rock.

12:29.754 --> 12:31.919
-Yup.
-That would be awesome.

12:31.921 --> 12:33.639
Y'all do the sampling.

to where we're at right now.

13:05.441 --> 13:08.439
I actually don't know how far,

13:08.481 --> 13:09.999
I... You know what,
I think it is.

13:10.074 --> 13:11.919
It's that [bleep] drop
right now.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.439
-[man] Where that tree is?
-[Dustin] That's the
property line.

13:13.441 --> 13:15.879
I think that's it.
I'll tell you once I see it.

13:15.881 --> 13:17.179
[man] No.

13:17.181 --> 13:19.759
So let's go see
what the access looks like.

13:20.961 --> 13:22.299
[man] Huh,
I thought this was it.

13:22.301 --> 13:24.439
I said, "Hey, this is pretty,
we can do this."

13:24.441 --> 13:26.959
[Dustin] No.
This would be too easy.

13:31.041 --> 13:32.679

some pretty fast water.

-[man] <i> That's moving, dude.</i>
-[Dustin] <i> Yeah, it's moving</i>

13:40.241 --> 13:41.919
[Dustin] It's all water
from here out.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.879
Yeah, I don't know
if the water is too crazy.

13:43.954 --> 13:45.319
Nothing I can do.

13:46.481 --> 13:48.359
[Scott] A cliff...

13:48.434 --> 13:51.599
Just past the cliff,
there's another draw
that comes down.

13:51.601 --> 13:54.399
We ain't getting up this way.
We got to go up and over.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.599
[Dustin] All right.
Why don't you explore that?

13:56.601 --> 13:58.839
You see if you can make
a trail over the top.

13:58.841 --> 14:00.679
-[Scott] All right.
-I can walk this, I think.

14:00.681 --> 14:01.839
But, well, let's see.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.759
-Uh, James.
-[James] Yeah?

14:03.794 --> 14:05.599
-You got a shovel to help him?
-[James] Okay.

you got to do to get there.

can find a way over the top,

20:31.681 --> 20:32.719
to get to where
we're gonna dredge,

20:32.721 --> 20:34.159
we're gonna spend
a lot of time

20:34.194 --> 20:36.072
just trying to get there.

20:36.074 --> 20:39.159
[Paul] Hopefully, those guys
can find a better access
up and over the top.

20:39.161 --> 20:42.359
[tense music playing]

20:42.361 --> 20:45.599
[Scott] [bleep]
get out of my face.

20:48.001 --> 20:50.159
Oh, it opens up
big time here, dude.

20:50.161 --> 20:52.199
-[James] What's that?
-[Scott] It opens up big time.

20:53.401 --> 20:55.839
[narrator] <i> Hundreds of feet</i>

21:04.001 --> 21:06.239
-[Scott] Wow.
-[James] Holy [bleep].

21:07.801 --> 21:10.639
That looks like the dive spot
Dustin's talking about.

21:11.681 --> 21:13.879
Wow.

21:13.921 --> 21:15.879
[Scott] The whole river
is covered in snow,
look at that.

21:15.881 --> 21:17.039
[James] Yeah, it is.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.799
We're gonna have to
wait for it to...

21:19.201 --> 21:20.679
[sighs]

21:20.754 --> 21:22.759
Man, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

21:24.041 --> 21:25.352
Are you going out there?

21:25.354 --> 21:27.279
I'll go out to that rock
at least and take a look.

21:27.281 --> 21:29.479
That'll give me
a good look up and down.

21:29.481 --> 21:31.679
To see if we might have
missed something, you know.

21:31.754 --> 21:33.119
[James] Just be careful, man.

21:33.121 --> 21:34.599
Yeah. We get anchored up.

21:34.601 --> 21:37.319
[tense music playing]

21:37.321 --> 21:38.799
[James] You bang on it.

21:42.321 --> 21:43.439
[Scott] To me.

21:46.201 --> 21:47.719
Nice and slow.

21:48.961 --> 21:50.239
[James] Careful, Scott.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.039
It's [bleep] vertical.

21:54.321 --> 21:57.039
Basically, this squeeze
right here,

21:57.041 --> 22:00.919
that choke point behind me,
that's the line.

22:00.921 --> 22:03.319
That's where
the snow melt stops.

22:03.361 --> 22:06.239
I can't see flowing water
at all upstream.

22:07.281 --> 22:09.639
<i> Nothing but snow</i>
<i> and avalanche debris.</i>

22:10.481 --> 22:12.159

22:12.161 --> 22:14.239
<i> There's snow going for miles</i>

22:17.041 --> 22:19.599
[Scott] <i> It's sheer</i>
<i> vertical here.</i>

22:19.601 --> 22:22.759
It's sheer vertical there.

22:23.761 --> 22:26.239
I don't see a viable option

22:26.241 --> 22:29.599
for this to be any
kind of a route to work, man.

22:29.674 --> 22:30.719
This is...

22:31.441 --> 22:32.959
This is no-go.

22:32.994 --> 22:34.399
[James] Yeah. It's too much.

22:34.401 --> 22:36.159
[Scott] I can tell you
honestly, though.

22:36.161 --> 22:38.359
If I was working below,

22:38.401 --> 22:40.519
feel a whole lot better
about that not being there.

22:41.841 --> 22:43.399

23:09.601 --> 23:11.039
All I know, James,
I really hope that

23:11.041 --> 23:13.279
Dustin and them are having
a hell of a lot better luck

23:13.354 --> 23:15.239
at finding a route to work
than we are.

23:15.241 --> 23:16.799
[James] I can see him.

23:18.001 --> 23:19.639
Dustin!

23:22.081 --> 23:24.359
[tense music playing]

23:24.361 --> 23:26.119
[man] They're on a cliff
up there.

23:26.234 --> 23:27.839
-But we could see them?
-Oh, yeah.

23:27.914 --> 23:29.799
-That's [bleep] high, dude.
-About top, top. Top, top.

23:29.801 --> 23:32.719
[bleep] that way, that way.

23:35.841 --> 23:37.759
[Dustin] This ain't it!

23:37.834 --> 23:38.999
It's further up!

23:39.041 --> 23:40.159
[man] Is it really?

23:40.161 --> 23:42.759
He said it's further up,
it's not the spot!

23:45.161 --> 23:46.679
[man] I can just
stick to that, man,

23:46.681 --> 23:49.079
it's just one section!

too strong, man.

[Dustin] [bleep]
that's crazy, man.

24:29.521 --> 24:31.439
[man] It's pile
of snow up there now.

24:31.441 --> 24:34.079
[man] Holy [bleep] there's
[bleep] snow up there still.

24:34.154 --> 24:36.439

all the way across the creek.

gonna be so much damn snow.

24:58.521 --> 25:00.599
You would think
it was wintertime here.

This is not going as planned.

25:07.081 --> 25:09.599
[Carlos] Our gold
is underneath that snow.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.319
Means it's a late start for us

25:11.361 --> 25:13.199
until that snow
gets out of there.

There's a fault line
running right here.

25:23.241 --> 25:24.759
I wanna do samples

25:24.761 --> 25:26.199
because it might
give us an idea

25:26.201 --> 25:27.279
of what we can expect to find

25:27.354 --> 25:28.999
when we do hit bedrock there.

[Carlos] Holy [bleep]
what the [bleep] was that?

25:36.641 --> 25:37.519
That was me.

25:37.521 --> 25:38.799
I rolled the rock.

25:42.001 --> 25:44.399

came down on Kayla.

26:50.681 --> 26:53.399
Kayla was down the bottom,
doing some panning,

-[Kayla] Just a little puffy.

tonight and tomorrow.

Well, whenever
you guys are ready,

that there's no way

-[Paul] Yeah.

28:09.081 --> 28:11.559
Here comes Scott and James.

28:11.561 --> 28:13.239
Hopefully they got us a trail.

28:13.281 --> 28:15.719
What, you guys decided to
just take the afternoon off?

28:15.794 --> 28:17.439
-Just lounge around?
-[groans]

28:17.441 --> 28:18.705
[Kayla] Yup,
that's what we did.

28:18.781 --> 28:20.679
-[Dustin] Find us a trail?
-[Scott] [bleep] no.

28:20.681 --> 28:22.079
-[James] There's no way.
-[Dustin] So,
there's no trail?

28:22.081 --> 28:23.759
-No way in hell.
-Not that way.

28:23.761 --> 28:25.479
-It's vertical.
-[man] Wow.

28:25.481 --> 28:26.639
[Scott] You saw
where I was standing there?

28:26.641 --> 28:28.239
How vertical? Thousand feet...

28:28.241 --> 28:30.639
-Vertical, vertical.
-400 feet, 200 feet?

28:30.641 --> 28:31.559
I can do 200 feet.

28:31.634 --> 28:33.119
Three to four.

28:33.121 --> 28:34.399
-Three to four.
-[man] Wow.

28:34.401 --> 28:36.319
[Scott] Somewhere
in that neighborhood.

28:36.321 --> 28:40.039
And we got sights on up creek.

28:40.041 --> 28:41.519
-It's all snow covered.
-[Scott] Yup.

28:41.521 --> 28:43.199
[Kayla] We ran into snow, too.

28:43.201 --> 28:45.119
But just past that snow
that you guys ran into,

28:45.194 --> 28:48.999
there's like a 20-foot tall
[bleep] ice dam.

28:50.881 --> 28:53.239
You don't think there's any
access at all from up there?

28:53.601 --> 28:55.399
None?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.319
[Scott] It just gets steeper
and steeper and steeper.

28:58.394 --> 28:59.479
[James] Walking up the creek
is our only hope.

28:59.521 --> 29:00.839
[Scott] Yup.

29:01.441 --> 29:03.759
[Dustin] <i> This place</i>
<i> is not easy to dig.</i>

29:03.761 --> 29:05.319

29:05.394 --> 29:07.399
I've got a whole
new set of problems.

29:08.761 --> 29:12.839
It seems like
McKinley on steroids.

29:12.841 --> 29:15.919
[dramatic music playing]

29:22.961 --> 29:24.359
[Kayla] It could
have been way worse.

29:24.434 --> 29:26.559
If I had broken my ankle,
you know,

29:26.634 --> 29:28.479
I'd be out for several weeks

29:28.481 --> 29:30.519
that I wouldn't be able
to really do anything.

29:31.321 --> 29:32.999
I'm gonna put some ice on it.

29:33.001 --> 29:34.759
Hopefully,
it'll go down by the morning.

29:34.761 --> 29:37.439
I'm not glad it happened,
but I'm glad it happened

29:37.441 --> 29:41.199
before I'm actually
mining and diving,

29:41.201 --> 29:43.879
stuff like that,
because if it keeps me

29:43.881 --> 29:45.279
out of the water,
that would have pissed me off

29:45.281 --> 29:46.559
a whole lot more.

29:46.634 --> 29:49.639
[dramatic music playing]

29:57.441 --> 29:58.999
[Scott] I think these will do.

30:00.241 --> 30:02.159
[James] That rock
is teetering, so...

30:02.161 --> 30:05.159
-You guys, is that
all we're gonna need?
-Yeah.

30:05.161 --> 30:07.039
[Dustin] Well, we have to get
this rock down today, guys.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.159
It has to be
pushed over the edge

30:09.234 --> 30:10.879
before there's humans
down there.

30:10.881 --> 30:12.079
-Absolutely.
-All right.

30:12.081 --> 30:14.239
So, we'll head up
there right now

30:14.241 --> 30:16.239
and see if we can get
this rock to bust loose, huh?

30:16.241 --> 30:17.679

30:17.754 --> 30:18.952
-Let's rock.
-Let's get up the hill.

30:19.027 --> 30:20.839
It's better to deal with it
in the dive site,

30:20.841 --> 30:22.519
when we put it there
on purpose

30:22.561 --> 30:23.825
rather than deal with it
at the dive site

30:23.901 --> 30:26.359

there on its own.

[narrator] <i> Dustin must devis</i>

30:46.081 --> 30:47.559
What do you think of our

30:49.201 --> 30:51.519
[Dustin] That is a big
damn rock.

30:51.521 --> 30:52.879
I don't think you could aim
that thing more

30:52.881 --> 30:54.399

30:55.601 --> 30:56.799
[Dustin] Oh, that'd kill you.

30:58.121 --> 31:00.359
All right, guys,
let's set up a rope.

31:00.434 --> 31:02.159
Let's knock that boulder off.

31:02.234 --> 31:03.959

[James] Yup.
Should we try to get
that ground rock out of there

40:30.721 --> 40:32.239
[Carlos] [bleep] dang!

40:41.801 --> 40:44.959
[tense music playing]

40:54.241 --> 40:55.719
[Dustin]
The bag's [bleep] heavy.

40:59.161 --> 41:00.759
I'm out of shape.

41:02.281 --> 41:04.439
This is a dangerous
[bleep] area.

41:06.121 --> 41:08.519
It's been a while since
I've been in the water
like this.

41:15.001 --> 41:16.279
See all that?

41:16.281 --> 41:19.319
[tense music playing]

41:26.121 --> 41:27.759
[breathes heavily]

41:27.834 --> 41:29.039
That was something.

41:32.561 --> 41:33.519
[man] That was crazy.

41:33.594 --> 41:35.112
That [bleep] could hit you.

41:36.801 --> 41:40.319
[narrator] <i> Desperate</i>

-Thank you.

41:54.801 --> 41:56.119
[Carlos] I've never
seen nothing like this.

41:56.121 --> 41:58.399
Look how thick that is, dude.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.559
[Dustin] Yeah.

41:59.634 --> 42:00.999
A lot of ice.

42:02.121 --> 42:03.839
[Carlos] Hey, can you imagine
what's in here, dude?

42:03.914 --> 42:06.399
Underneath these rocks?

42:06.401 --> 42:10.199
[Dustin] Oh, my [bleep] dude,
this is gonna be full of gold.

42:10.241 --> 42:13.319
[country music playing]

42:16.201 --> 42:17.599
[Dustin] Oi!

42:17.601 --> 42:18.799
The rock's right here.

42:18.874 --> 42:20.279
[Carlos] Oh, yeah?

42:20.321 --> 42:21.919
[Dustin] The impact
is right here.

42:21.994 --> 42:23.579
[Carlos] [bleep] I thought
you were gonna bring

42:23.581 --> 42:26.239
-this whole thing down, dude.
-It looks like a damn crater.

42:26.241 --> 42:28.999
[narrator] <i> But even</i>
<i> a 4,000-pound boulder</i>

42:29.001 --> 42:30.919
<i> couldn't smash</i>
<i> through the barrier</i>

42:30.921 --> 42:32.719
<i> around their dive site.</i>

42:34.921 --> 42:37.119
I got a feeling
we're gonna have a big payday

42:37.121 --> 42:39.439
once we get all the snow
out of the way.

42:41.681 --> 42:44.199
[James] Set the pump up down
here somewhere on the wall?

42:44.274 --> 42:45.679
We're gonna burn that edge

42:45.754 --> 42:47.279
until that starts
to collapse in.

42:47.354 --> 42:49.439
-[Carlos] Okay. Got it.
-If we can get up there,

42:49.441 --> 42:51.119
that would be nice

42:51.121 --> 42:54.239
to put, like,
a sprinkler setup there.

42:54.241 --> 43:00.599
So, right now,
we're about to set up a pump,

43:00.601 --> 43:03.399
so we can pump some water up
and melt some ice.

43:03.881 --> 43:05.959
A little ice hydraulic-ing.

43:08.321 --> 43:09.639
All right.
Let's get that over there

43:09.641 --> 43:11.959
and fix it in a position.

43:11.961 --> 43:13.559
Spin it so
we can put that pipe on.

43:13.601 --> 43:15.159
[James] Okay.

43:15.161 --> 43:16.399
[Carlos] That'll work.

43:16.401 --> 43:18.119
[James] I got the gasket
for this.

43:20.041 --> 43:21.319
I think it's gonna work,

43:21.321 --> 43:22.799
but I can't guarantee it.

43:25.761 --> 43:27.639
[Dustin] There it goes.

43:27.641 --> 43:29.959
It's starting to to...
Starting to power up.

43:31.641 --> 43:32.719
It's coming.

43:32.721 --> 43:34.039
Let it happen.

43:37.081 --> 43:39.119
There it goes.
There it goes. There it goes.

43:40.281 --> 43:42.119
All right.
That's a lot of water.

43:42.194 --> 43:43.719
[Carlos] That is
a lot of water.

43:49.281 --> 43:50.999
Holy [bleep]
look how fast that works.

43:51.001 --> 43:52.599
[man] Holy moly!

43:52.601 --> 43:54.519
[laughter]

43:55.761 --> 43:57.359
Man, the pump's working great!

43:58.841 --> 44:00.959
It's a start,
we're cutting the snow.

44:04.201 --> 44:05.479
[Carlos] Today is a mess.

44:05.481 --> 44:07.199
We can clear
this whole out, man.

44:17.761 --> 44:18.999
-Be careful.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:19.041 --> 44:20.859
I'm always careful.

44:21.361 --> 44:24.879
What we're gonna do is,
we're gonna lash it off
to one of these.

44:24.881 --> 44:26.559
And just tie it off
really good.

44:26.561 --> 44:28.719
And we're gonna
let it spray all night,

44:28.721 --> 44:30.599
one spot out there
in the middle,

44:30.601 --> 44:32.879
and hopefully overnight,

44:32.914 --> 44:34.599
it'll just burn a hole
right through the center,

44:34.601 --> 44:35.919
and this whole thing
would collapse,

44:35.921 --> 44:36.799
then we won't be around.

44:37.161 --> 44:39.199
Be like a time bomb.

44:45.001 --> 44:47.399
[Carlos] It's gonna work,
dude. It's gonna work.

44:47.474 --> 44:49.119
[Dustin] We can
leave this all night.

44:49.841 --> 44:51.079
I hope it works.

44:51.081 --> 44:52.559
Let's get out of here.

44:52.634 --> 44:54.119
It's starting
to look dangerous.

44:58.201 --> 45:01.319
[dramatic music playing]

45:03.201 --> 45:05.079
[Dustin] Carlos, you think
the sprinklers worked, yeah?

45:05.121 --> 45:06.679
[Carlos] Yeah, dude, I...

45:06.721 --> 45:07.799
Man, I hope it's working.

45:07.801 --> 45:09.352
It should work.

45:17.561 --> 45:20.799
[narrator] <i> Dustin and Carlo</i>

45:35.721 --> 45:37.559
Not fast enough, man.

45:37.561 --> 45:39.199
Yeah, it's melting.
Don't get me wrong.

45:39.201 --> 45:41.999
It's melting, but it's just
not melting fast enough.

45:42.074 --> 45:43.919
[Dustin] How thick you think
that is right there?

45:43.921 --> 45:46.839
[Carlos] That's at least
about 20 feet right there.

45:46.841 --> 45:49.479
Twenty feet of snow, huh?
Just won't go, dude.

45:49.554 --> 45:51.719

[Dustin] Not gonna work.

46:09.921 --> 46:11.559
I don't know what else to do.

46:11.561 --> 46:14.359
[Carlos] You have to
come up with better ideas.

46:14.361 --> 46:16.519
[Dustin] I bought
these claims,

46:16.521 --> 46:19.879
thinking I was, uh, smarter
than I actually am.

46:19.954 --> 46:21.359
Now, I can't dig on 'em

46:21.434 --> 46:23.639
because there's too much
ice and snow.

46:23.681 --> 46:25.279
