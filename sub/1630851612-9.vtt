00:38.239 --> 00:39.238
You have something powerful.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.406
<i> The "alter ego" semi-finals...</i>

00:40.441 --> 00:42.808
- Whoa.
-<i> ...Begin now.</i>

00:42.843 --> 00:43.909
It just got real, y'all.

00:48.582 --> 00:52.284
Welcome to "alter ego,"
the semi-finals.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.420
I'm your host rocsi diaz.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.588
Before we get into it,
I've gotta introduce

00:56.624 --> 01:00.426
my favorite judging panel
in town. Hello?

01:00.461 --> 01:01.927
Musician, producer,

01:01.996 --> 01:03.729
and tech entrepreneur will.I.Am!

01:06.667 --> 01:09.068
Singer, songwriter, and artist,

01:09.103 --> 01:10.936
the legendary alanis morissette.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.243
Producer, artist,
and innovator, grimes.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.583
And actor, singer,
and host nick lachey.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.785
'sup?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.587
Hey, you guys.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.622
It's tonight's semi-finalists,

01:30.658 --> 01:32.391
misty rose, queen dynamite,

01:32.393 --> 01:35.794
wolfgang champagne,
and night journey.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.097
These four alter egos
have made it through

01:38.165 --> 01:39.798
our auditions,
the head-to-heads.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.433
Yeah!

01:41.435 --> 01:43.268
And by the end of tonight,

01:43.304 --> 01:45.437
two alter egos
will be eliminated

01:45.439 --> 01:47.439
and reveal their identity
to the judges,

01:47.475 --> 01:50.309
and two will secure
their spots in the finale.

01:52.746 --> 01:55.747
Alanis, what does it take
to be a winner

01:55.783 --> 01:56.982
on this stage tonight?

01:57.051 --> 01:58.917
I think it's a combination
of things.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.186
So, your voice, your movement,

02:01.222 --> 02:02.754
would you be alter ego

02:02.790 --> 02:04.823
where millions and millions
of people are watching you

02:04.825 --> 02:08.894
and you're a superstar
fueling this new technology
into the next era for us?

02:08.929 --> 02:12.064
- So, godspeed.
- Hell, yeah.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.633
Good luck to you all.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.336
These are huge stakes
and a lot on the line

02:17.404 --> 02:19.204
to be
the next generation superstar.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.641
Misty rose, you're up first.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.949
We're in the semi-finals now.
Like, this is real.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.518
Like, the competition is--

02:32.553 --> 02:34.386
it's ramping up, I'll say that.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.756
When misty rose
and samaera hit the stage,

02:37.791 --> 02:39.191
you never know
what you're gonna get.

02:39.226 --> 02:41.226
Like, I love pushing the limits.

02:41.262 --> 02:44.596
For the semi-finals,
misty is bringing it.

02:44.632 --> 02:47.566
She is on roller skates.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.701
<i> ( music playing )</i>

02:49.770 --> 02:50.903
like, it definitely adds
something different,

02:50.971 --> 02:52.704
because no one else
is on roller skates.

02:52.773 --> 02:57.075
I love challenge,
so I'm in it to win it now
at this point.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.310
Like, it's game time.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.847
Whoa, she got roller skates on.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.148
Hey, y'all.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.584
So this is, like,
the bring it or go home round,

03:05.586 --> 03:06.785
you know what I mean?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.787
This is, like,
where it's all on the line.

03:08.822 --> 03:12.057
So how have you elevated
your game, so to speak,

03:12.092 --> 03:13.892
as we get into
this semi-final round now?

03:13.928 --> 03:15.928
I quite literally elevated

03:15.996 --> 03:18.530
by getting onto
these roller skates,

03:18.599 --> 03:21.233
and I truly believe that I am

03:21.268 --> 03:23.869
going to embody misty rose
in this performance.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.705
I'm gonna give you guys a show.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.940
All right, well,
let's give it a go.

03:28.942 --> 03:30.909
All right, let's rock and roll!

03:33.280 --> 03:35.214
Will: Oh, she really is
for real skating.

03:35.282 --> 03:37.816
- Alanis: Yes.
- Wow, okay.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.918
I'm really blown away now.
Let's do this, misty rose.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.871
Wow.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.075
That's what this show
is all about, right?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.110
We're trying to find
the next generation superstar,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.746
and that alter ego
is supposed to embody

05:47.781 --> 05:49.748
all of those things
coming together.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.617
Perfect use of technology,
perfect use of creativity,

05:52.686 --> 05:54.386
and a great voice.

05:54.421 --> 05:57.055
It was, like, the trifecta
of seeing all those things
come together.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.925
- So way to kick off the show.
That was fantastic.
- Thank you so much.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.728
I'm selling tickets to
"the misty rose show" right now.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.730
Just wait till you
get to the actual show.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.898
It's gonna just like
that performance.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.667
I love it.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.369
Misty rose, remind me why

06:10.437 --> 06:12.437
you're here
at "alter ego" again.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.906
I wanna be the next
digital pop superstar.

06:14.942 --> 06:17.209
I mean,
who else has an opportunity
like this, you know?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.346
Wow!

06:22.983 --> 06:25.083
Judges, it's time for your vote.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.486
Uh-oh. Whoa.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.755
Remember, the alter ego
who is on the diamond

06:29.790 --> 06:34.025
at the end of the show
will automatically advance
to the finale.

06:34.061 --> 06:37.863
She will need at least
three of your votes
to get that spot.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.866
If misty rose doesn't get up
on the diamond,

06:40.868 --> 06:45.670
she'll be up for elimination
by an audience and judge vote.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.672
Nick?

06:47.708 --> 06:51.777
Obviously we don't know
what the other three alter egos
are gonna do tonight,

06:51.845 --> 06:53.779
but what I just heard
from misty rose

06:53.814 --> 06:56.548
was certainly finale-worthy.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.083
Thank you!

06:58.118 --> 07:00.552
And again, I love the way
she incorporated

07:00.587 --> 07:02.587
all the elements of what
we're trying to do here,

07:02.623 --> 07:05.857
which is discover, you know,
the next generation superstar.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.093
So until she's dethroned,

07:08.128 --> 07:09.494
she absolutely deserves
to be on that diamond.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.897
- I love it.
- Thank you so much.

07:13.100 --> 07:16.968
Grimes, does she have your vote
to be on that diamond?

07:18.772 --> 07:20.739
Yeah, absolutely, definitely so,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.308
and I would make out
with misty rose, so...

07:23.343 --> 07:26.077
Misty: Oh, my god.
I would love to.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.212
Thank you.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.383
That is the coolest thing
in the freaking world

07:31.418 --> 07:34.886
because grimes is, like,
one of the coolest people
in the freaking world.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.390
- I don't know about that.
- But that--

07:38.425 --> 07:43.595
that to me is--
that's dope-dope.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.264
I don't know what
the other singers are gonna do,

07:46.266 --> 07:48.600
but there's no roof
on this building right now

07:48.635 --> 07:52.471
- 'cause you just blew it off.
- Ooh! Thank you!

07:52.473 --> 07:56.641
And so, boom,
I'm with misty on the diamond.

07:56.677 --> 08:00.745
- Thank you so much, will.
- Rocsi: Alanis?

08:00.747 --> 08:03.882
I just think your voice
and your movement
and that whole performance,

08:03.951 --> 08:07.385
the whole package deal of that
was super impressive.

08:07.454 --> 08:10.055
I want misty on that diamond.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.824
Thank you.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.527
You really
only needed three votes

08:15.629 --> 08:17.696
to get on that diamond,
but you got all four, mama.

08:17.698 --> 08:20.499
You are going up there,
taking that spot.

08:22.503 --> 08:24.369
Coming up,
our semi-finals continue.

08:24.438 --> 08:26.638
Can the rest of
the alter egos step up

08:26.673 --> 08:28.540
and show that they've got
what it takes

08:28.575 --> 08:30.308
to be
the next generation superstar?

08:30.344 --> 08:33.778
Two will go to the finale,
and two will go home.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.848
- Man, this is gonna be tough.
- I know.

08:36.917 --> 08:39.117
"alter ego" continues
after this.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.656
I am shocked that I'm here.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.591
- ( pants )
- there are singers,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.093
and then there are entertainers.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.629
I'm not really afraid of what
people think of me anymore.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.330
I get goose bumps
every time you sing.

08:52.399 --> 08:54.132
( vocalizing )

08:54.201 --> 08:57.736
I will not hear
the end of it if I lose.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.838
Night journey: I definitely
feel more pressure.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.207
Wolfgang: There's no way
not to be nervous.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.441
It just got real, y'all.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.310
Rocsi:
The alter ego who received

09:05.345 --> 09:08.480
the fewest audience votes is...

09:12.252 --> 09:14.719
Announcer:<i> Wolfgang's at</i>
<i> the motion capture stage.</i>

09:14.788 --> 09:17.389
<i> Going to rocsi</i>
<i> in three, two, one.</i>

09:20.460 --> 09:23.428
Welcome back to "alter ego."
I'm rocsi diaz.

09:23.463 --> 09:27.232
We just saw misty rose
earn a spot on the diamond

09:27.267 --> 09:29.067
with her semi-final performance.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.902
If she remains on the diamond,

09:30.938 --> 09:33.171
she will get a coveted spot
in the finale.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.907
But will she able to stay there?

09:35.943 --> 09:39.811
That's up to our next alter ego.
It's wolfgang champagne.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.783
Wolfgang: I am shocked
that I'm here.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.752
It's like waking up
from a coma and just saying,
"am I still here?"

09:47.788 --> 09:49.621
but there's no way
not to be nervous

09:49.656 --> 09:51.556
because of the magnitude
of the show.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.891
Yeah, well, thank you very much.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.859
I'm looking forward
to performing.

09:54.895 --> 09:57.128
I did opera for over 26 years.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.064
I went to
the juilliard opera center.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.300
It was what I trained to do
right out of high school.

10:02.336 --> 10:06.137
Doing opera allowed me
to have a long career.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.140
I've lived a life to 60.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.743
Technically, I'm supposed
to retire in five years,

10:11.778 --> 10:15.146
but I'm still driving a truck.

10:15.148 --> 10:16.581
We sleep in a little bed

10:16.616 --> 10:19.184
and go out for three,
four months at a time

10:19.219 --> 10:21.152
living in your truck.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.756
The purpose of me personally
being here on "alter ego"?

10:24.791 --> 10:27.993
My daughters, emma and grace,
they're beautiful people,

10:28.028 --> 10:30.095
but I never see my family
driving a truck.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.031
So, it'll allow me family time
and inspire my kids

10:33.066 --> 10:37.102
that nothing is out of reach
no matter how old you get.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.841
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

10:42.876 --> 10:44.075
How you been, man?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.644
It's great seeing you here, man,

10:45.679 --> 10:47.245
'cause I'm still here.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.981
If I wasn't here,
I really wouldn't like
any of you at all.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.716
That's all I'm gonna say.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.918
I feel conditionally loved
by you, wolfgang.

10:53.954 --> 10:57.756
Hey, no. Miss morissette,
you have not saved me,

10:57.758 --> 10:59.958
made me safe, or done anything.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.060
So you don't get
to call me wolfy.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.428
You gotta call me spatula,

11:03.463 --> 11:05.397
because before
the end of the night,

11:05.432 --> 11:08.066
I'm gonna flip you
to team wolfpack right here.

11:08.068 --> 11:09.267
Yeah!

11:13.940 --> 11:16.641
In the event
that you win this thing,

11:16.677 --> 11:19.077
what kind of fan experience
would you promise your fans?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.712
Like, what kind of a show
would you put on?

11:20.747 --> 11:22.914
Live, love, and laugh, baby.

11:22.949 --> 11:23.948
The tour would be

11:23.984 --> 11:27.585
"wolfy's doggone
state of the arts tour."

11:27.587 --> 11:28.920
yeah!

11:28.955 --> 11:32.057
You'll have a howling good time!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.592
All right, well, wolfy,

11:34.628 --> 11:36.361
let's see if you can
keep moving forward, man.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.363
- You ready to go?
- Let's go!

11:41.168 --> 11:44.035
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
he could really take it
to the next lev.

11:44.071 --> 11:47.472
This whole thing,
this howling at the moon stuff?

11:47.474 --> 11:48.640
Smart.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.278
Yeah!

13:35.615 --> 13:37.916
Will.I.Am: Whoo!

13:37.951 --> 13:40.084
Crowd: Wolfy! Wolfy!
Wolfy! Wolfy!

13:40.120 --> 13:43.388
That's right!

13:43.423 --> 13:46.257
Wolfy, before we start talking
about that amazing performance,

13:46.326 --> 13:51.229
I do I wanna show some love
to our bomb house band.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.231
A massive applause

13:53.233 --> 13:56.267
for adam blackstone
and the alter ego band.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.705
That was a really emotionally
evocative performance,

14:00.740 --> 14:02.674
and I think we all felt it.

14:02.709 --> 14:05.877
Like, in a million years,
I would never be
in front of you guys.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.912
I love everybody,
and I love every--

14:07.948 --> 14:10.915
everything that you guys
have done for me.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.017
Aw, man.

14:15.856 --> 14:19.424
You know, there are singers,
and then there are entertainers.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.626
And you are
an absolute entertainer,

14:21.661 --> 14:24.462
and don't ever stop.

14:24.464 --> 14:29.234
Crowd: Wolfy! Wolfy! Wolfy!
Wolfy! Wolfy!

14:29.269 --> 14:32.237
It's time to figure out whether
or not wolfgang champagne

14:32.272 --> 14:36.307
will take a spot on the diamond
away from misty rose.

14:36.309 --> 14:40.712
Remember, he needs
at least three of your votes
to put him there,

14:40.747 --> 14:43.147
so choose carefully.
What do you think, grimes?

14:43.183 --> 14:46.150
Grimes:
I love wolfgang champagne.

14:46.186 --> 14:47.919
I mean, I think you really
showed yourself as, like,

14:47.954 --> 14:50.054
a three-dimensional artist.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.790
But, misty rose, you've been
really winning me over,

14:52.792 --> 14:57.428
and I don't think I can
take misty off the diamond.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.898
However, that was such
a good performance,

14:59.966 --> 15:01.432
and I will be fighting
for you, wolfy.

15:05.739 --> 15:10.074
Misty rose,
that was the best use of props

15:10.110 --> 15:13.411
aligning with the alter ego.

15:13.480 --> 15:18.750
But, wolfy, I wasn't expecting
radiohead, "creep."

15:18.785 --> 15:22.487
to hear that
with a pop opera twist to it
was pretty magical.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.256
But then today
was the first time that we saw

15:25.292 --> 15:27.592
- a sensitive side to wolf.
- Mm-hmm.

15:27.627 --> 15:30.862
Will:
I thought that that dynamic,
to go from all those gears

15:30.897 --> 15:33.598
has been
pretty freaking fantastic.

15:33.633 --> 15:37.001
And so with that, I would like
to see wolfy on the diamond.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.671
Rocsi: That is one vote
for wolfgang

15:39.706 --> 15:41.339
and one vote for misty rose.

15:41.374 --> 15:45.109
Alanis, does wolfgang deserve
to be on the diamond?

15:45.145 --> 15:48.146
I think, wolfy, you're a huge,
huge superstar.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.283
But I loved
misty rose's performance,

15:52.319 --> 15:55.153
and I felt to be a really
holistic experience

15:55.188 --> 15:57.588
on multiple levels.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.924
So as much as it tortures me
to say this,

15:59.960 --> 16:03.528
I'm going to keep misty
on that diamond.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.369
Rocsi:
Wolfy needed three votes
to be on the diamond.

16:11.438 --> 16:15.173
Later tonight,
you'll be at the mercy
of an audience and judge vote.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.941
Oh, wolfy!

16:16.943 --> 16:18.743
Rocsi:
Because two alter egos
are going home

16:18.745 --> 16:21.045
at the end of the night.
We're gonna find out.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.947
More show after this.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.051
I just want everybody to come,
laugh, have a good time,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.486
and not learn a thing.

16:31.257 --> 16:33.624
<i> ♪ the things you say </i>

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
♪ we're unpredictable

16:35.662 --> 16:41.265
( humming "unbelievable" )

16:41.267 --> 16:44.102
- that sounds about right.
- It's "unbelievable."

16:45.238 --> 16:46.904
sadly, that's what I do
with my own lyrics.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.307
You know what?
If it's your song,
you can do whatever you want.

16:49.309 --> 16:52.310
I cannot remember a lyric
to save my life.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.112
<i> ♪ you're unbelievable </i>

16:58.218 --> 17:00.084
welcome back.
You're watching "alter ego."

17:00.120 --> 17:01.452
I am rocsi diaz.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.489
We have four alter egos
competing for two spots

17:04.524 --> 17:05.890
in the finale tonight.

17:05.925 --> 17:08.893
Misty rose is currently
on the diamond.

17:08.928 --> 17:11.562
We'll see if she stays up there.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.898
But there's an alter ego
who's been dying

17:13.933 --> 17:17.235
to get on this stage
and give it all that she's got.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.037
So let's give her that chance.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.139
Give it up for queen dynamite.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.509
Queen dynamite:
To be in the semi-finals,

17:24.544 --> 17:27.378
it feels like, "is this real?"

17:27.380 --> 17:29.580
if I go to the finals,

17:29.582 --> 17:32.183
like, my head is blown.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.351
Like, it is blown.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.020
Like, "oh, my gosh, this is it."

17:36.056 --> 17:37.889
<i> ( music playing )</i>

17:37.957 --> 17:40.758
well, I would want
queen dynamite's brand to be

17:40.794 --> 17:43.227
somewhat of women empowerment.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.263
She lets everyone know that,
guess what.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.698
You can accomplish everything
you set out to do.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.868
Because coming from being
a teenage mother,

17:50.904 --> 17:53.538
it's been about ten plus years

17:53.606 --> 17:56.941
I have been waiting
for this opportunity.

17:56.976 --> 18:00.711
My daughter is izaria.
She is 12 years old.

18:00.747 --> 18:05.149
And my son is dash.
He is about to turn seven.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.086
My kids are definitely
my inspiration to keep fighting.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.255
And I know that
I will not hear the end of it

18:11.257 --> 18:13.424
from my daughter if I lose.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.059
I'm like, "no."

18:16.529 --> 18:20.531
if I won "alter ego,"
like, my kids will know

18:20.633 --> 18:23.901
that they can do
whatever they want to do.

18:23.903 --> 18:27.538
Whatever dreams they have,
it's nothing that can stop them.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.374
So, I really hope I win.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.276
I really hope so.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.048
- Whoo!
- Nick: So, queen dynamite,

18:37.117 --> 18:39.584
I'm curious, how are you
gonna up your game

18:39.586 --> 18:42.220
from the head-to-head rounds
to now the semi-final rounds?

18:42.255 --> 18:44.589
Well, in the head-to-heads,

18:44.624 --> 18:47.458
I really didn't know
who queen dynamite was.

18:47.494 --> 18:50.261
So I feel like I was able
to mesh that now,

18:50.263 --> 18:51.896
so I think
I'm just gonna be able

18:51.931 --> 18:53.898
to put on a great show.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.502
I want you all to know
who I am as queen dynamite.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.738
I wanna give my best.
So, I think I'm gonna rock it.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.042
All right,
let's see you rock it then,
queen dynamite.

21:06.599 --> 21:10.034
The world knows queen dynamite.
You are letting it show, girl.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.638
That was absolutely amazing.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.974
Judges, what did you think
of queen dynamite's performance?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.109
Alanis?

21:18.111 --> 21:20.544
I noticed a big evolution

21:20.580 --> 21:23.347
from auditions
to head-to-heads to here.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.116
It really shined through
in your performance

21:25.151 --> 21:27.885
that you've been upping
the ante on your own.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.387
Thank you so much.

21:30.923 --> 21:34.191
The diamond vote
is extremely important tonight.

21:37.263 --> 21:40.631
So, judges,
should queen dynamite

21:40.633 --> 21:43.434
be on the diamond
and in the finale?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.603
It's time to cast your votes.

21:45.638 --> 21:49.073
- Crowd: Dynamite! Dynamite!
- Whoo!

21:49.075 --> 21:54.078
I have to be real
with my decision.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.448
Queen dynamite,
your voice is powerful.

21:59.385 --> 22:02.086
But, misty rose,
you're so dynamic.

22:03.956 --> 22:08.492
And I'm gonna be putting
misty rose on the diamond.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.130
Rocsi: Queen dynamite,
you need three votes

22:13.199 --> 22:15.499
to get on the diamond,
and that is one for misty.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.303
One more vote for misty rose
will keep her on the diamond

22:19.339 --> 22:22.340
and put you at risk
of going home tonight.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.543
Alanis?

22:25.578 --> 22:28.179
I was already excited
before you started to sing

22:28.214 --> 22:32.917
just based on the whole look
of the experience.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.819
'cause it was an experience.
It wasn't just a performance.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.387
Thank you.

22:36.389 --> 22:40.057
But there's an intangible thing
that misty rose has

22:40.126 --> 22:43.594
that has me want to keep you
on the diamond.

22:43.629 --> 22:44.895
Thank you!

22:46.799 --> 22:49.266
Rocsi: That is two votes
for misty rose

22:49.302 --> 22:50.868
to stay on the diamond.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.371
We know you need
at least three votes

22:53.406 --> 22:54.872
to be put on the diamond.

23:00.279 --> 23:04.448
But sadly, that means
that you are at risk

23:04.517 --> 23:07.184
of going home tonight,
queen dynamite.

23:07.186 --> 23:09.887
With only two spots
on the line for the finale,

23:09.956 --> 23:12.890
this semi-final round
is getting intense.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.592
Our last performance
is after the break,

23:14.627 --> 23:15.893
so do not go anywhere.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.928
This is "alter ego" on fox.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.534
Misty gave a great
performance tonight.

23:23.603 --> 23:27.138
Like, misty just
wasn't on the docket for me
before until tonight.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.739
- She won you over, huh?
- Yeah, she won me over.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.708
Night journey can mess it up.
It's hers to take
or hers to mess up.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.276
Hanging in the balance.
I agree.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.982
Announcer:<i> Night journey</i>
<i> is ready for her performance.</i>

23:38.017 --> 23:40.618
<i> Motion capture is set.</i>

23:40.686 --> 23:41.619
Welcome back to "alter ego."

23:41.654 --> 23:43.521
what?

23:43.556 --> 23:46.056
Rocsi:
Misty rose is on the diamond,

23:46.125 --> 23:48.592
and there is only one thing
standing between her

23:48.628 --> 23:52.396
and a spot in the finale.
It's night journey.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.868
Night journey:
I definitely feel more pressure

23:57.904 --> 24:00.171
going into this round than
I have this whole competition.

24:00.206 --> 24:03.374
It's a little more tense
when we're all
around each other.

24:03.409 --> 24:06.076
Night journey is all about
the light and the dark,

24:06.112 --> 24:09.146
and that's where I get, like,
a lot of my inspiration.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.215
Growing up,
I always had depression,

24:11.250 --> 24:12.583
and that's something
I struggled with.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.186
And then as I got older,
it developed into bipolar.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.423
Music saved my life,
'cause I started writing music

24:19.425 --> 24:21.892
when I felt like
I didn't have any hope,

24:21.928 --> 24:24.261
and it gave me a way
to express how I feel.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.263
♪ and I know

24:26.265 --> 24:29.233
♪ time will not retreat

24:29.268 --> 24:31.902
♪ but I'm standing on my feet

24:31.938 --> 24:35.072
that's why night journey
is so obsessed
with telling a story.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.708
Night journey really gave me
an opportunity

24:37.743 --> 24:40.244
to see that there is light
in my dark,

24:40.279 --> 24:42.713
and I'm okay because of that.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.081
Thank you.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.083
The judges are looking
for more than just a singer.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.751
They're looking for an artist.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.221
I'm not really afraid of what
people think of me anymore,

24:50.256 --> 24:51.422
and I might be able to be

24:51.457 --> 24:53.457
the next digital superstar
because of it.

24:54.594 --> 24:57.595
Grimes: Night journey,
if you were to put out a record,

24:57.630 --> 24:58.896
how would you describe
your music,

24:58.965 --> 25:00.831
and what genre
would your music be?

25:00.867 --> 25:02.366
- Indie.
- Cool.

25:02.435 --> 25:04.235
I would want my music
to be something

25:04.270 --> 25:06.337
that people turn on
when they're alone,

25:06.372 --> 25:09.273
and I would want it
to be for all the people
who feel lost.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.408
Okay.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.446
Night journey,
are you ready to sing for us?

25:15.515 --> 25:16.580
I'm ready!

25:20.920 --> 25:22.219
- Ooh!
- That's cool.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.855

Rocsi: Wow! Night journey!

27:06.726 --> 27:09.426
Crowd: Night journey!
Night journey!

27:09.462 --> 27:13.664
Judges, what did you think
of night journey?

27:15.067 --> 27:17.468
Singing with that kind of soul,

27:17.503 --> 27:19.837
that's not something
that's really taught,

27:19.872 --> 27:21.372
and night journey, really,

27:21.440 --> 27:23.907
she identifies
and sings from a place

27:23.943 --> 27:26.276
that makes it palpable.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.912
If you become
the next digital superstar,

27:28.948 --> 27:32.916
for that digital superstar
to have soul,

27:32.952 --> 27:34.785
I mean, that's the integration
of everything,

27:34.820 --> 27:37.254
and I'm here for you and it.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.023
Thank you so much.

27:41.794 --> 27:45.729
All right,
this is a huge decision
for the judges right now.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.731
The alter ego
they put on the diamond

27:47.800 --> 27:51.001
will automatically advance
to the finale.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.870
No one has been able
to knock misty rose

27:52.905 --> 27:55.039
off the diamond tonight,

27:55.074 --> 27:56.907
but will night journey
be able to?

27:56.909 --> 27:59.143
She will need
at least three votes.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.613
Judges, this is all
on you right now.

28:02.615 --> 28:04.615
It's time for your vote.

28:04.650 --> 28:07.885
Misty rose,
I think overall tonight

28:07.953 --> 28:12.089
you are probably most improved
in the whole show.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.725
And then, night journey,
it's, like, you've got something

28:14.794 --> 28:16.960
that's just really emotional

28:17.029 --> 28:20.097
and I get goose bumps
every time you sing.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.701
And so I am putting
night journey on the diamond.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.369
Thank you so much.

28:28.107 --> 28:32.076
That is one vote
for night journey to move on.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.210
Nick?

28:33.279 --> 28:34.545
Nick: This is a huge deal

28:34.580 --> 28:37.748
to get a guaranteed spot
in the finale.

28:37.783 --> 28:41.552
That being said,
there was something
about all the elements

28:41.587 --> 28:44.421
of what in my mind this show is

28:44.457 --> 28:46.423
that came together
for misty rose in a way

28:46.459 --> 28:47.958
that was really,
really powerful tonight.

28:47.993 --> 28:52.796
And so my vote would be to keep
misty rose on the diamond.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.735
Rocsi:
So far that is one vote each.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.436
Alanis?

28:59.472 --> 29:04.308
Misty rose,
I felt your performance
was so whole, you know?

29:05.644 --> 29:07.377
Then, night journey,

29:07.413 --> 29:08.746
just my overall
impression of you

29:08.781 --> 29:10.981
is that I would be
super fangirl-ing out

29:11.016 --> 29:12.883
just following your career.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.752
So I'm gonna ask night journey
to jump up there.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.057
That is two votes
for night journey.

29:20.092 --> 29:22.559
But night journey,
you need three votes

29:22.628 --> 29:24.495
to take that diamond spot.

29:24.497 --> 29:26.764
Will, it is all up to you.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.702
I think they both have
the ability to go to the final.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.205
- I like misty rose's pizzazz.
- Yeah.

29:35.274 --> 29:38.709
But then I like
night journey's depth.

29:38.744 --> 29:42.746
But the best performance
of the night...

29:42.782 --> 29:44.148
- Night journey,
night journey.
- ...Is misty.

29:44.183 --> 29:45.349
Yeah.

29:48.687 --> 29:51.755
Rocsi: I'm sorry, night journey.
You didn't get the three votes

29:51.791 --> 29:54.224
required to take a spot
on the diamond,

29:54.226 --> 29:57.461
so misty rose is going
to the finale.

29:57.496 --> 30:00.430
Which means, night journey,

30:00.466 --> 30:04.701
unfortunately, you are now
in danger of going home tonight.

30:04.737 --> 30:07.738
Three alter egos remain
in the running

30:07.807 --> 30:09.740
- for one spot in the finale.
- Oh, damn.

30:09.775 --> 30:13.510
Let's welcome wolfgang champagne

30:13.512 --> 30:15.946
and queen dynamite
back to the stage.

30:15.981 --> 30:17.981
Nick: Yeah!

30:18.017 --> 30:20.284
Rocsi: I will now
ask the audience to vote

30:20.319 --> 30:22.052
for their favorite alter ego.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.855
The alter ego that receives
the least votes

30:24.924 --> 30:26.857
will be eliminated.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.427
It just got real, y'all.

30:33.866 --> 30:35.465
They're so
dramatically different,

30:35.501 --> 30:38.001
- it's almost a matter of
which one do you prefer?
- Yeah.

30:42.107 --> 30:45.008
Only one alter ego
can move on to the finale.

30:45.044 --> 30:48.278
The audience votes
have officially been counted.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.787
And I can now confirm
that the alter ego

30:56.822 --> 31:00.891
who received
the fewest audience votes,

31:00.926 --> 31:05.829
becoming the first alter ego
to leave us tonight is...

31:19.511 --> 31:22.713
Rocsi:
We have three alter egos
up for elimination:

31:22.748 --> 31:25.716
Wolfgang champagne,
night journey,

31:25.751 --> 31:28.085
or queen dynamite.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.188
I can now confirm that
the alter ego

31:31.223 --> 31:33.657
who received
the fewest audience votes,

31:33.726 --> 31:37.461
becoming the first alter ego
to leave us tonight...

31:39.465 --> 31:40.898
Is...

31:44.837 --> 31:47.104
Queen dynamite.

31:50.075 --> 31:54.044
That means, wolfgang champagne
and night journey,

31:54.079 --> 31:56.313
you are safe for now.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.583
The judges will decide
your fate later tonight.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.055
Queen dynamite, before you go,

32:05.090 --> 32:07.891
would you please sing
one last song

32:07.960 --> 32:10.861
and then reveal your
true identity to the judges?

32:10.896 --> 32:12.663
Of course, I will.

32:12.665 --> 32:14.231
Yeah!

32:18.637 --> 32:21.405
- I really wanna meet
queen dynamite.
- Grimes: Yeah.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.674
Will: She, like,

Dynamite! Dynamite!

34:28.467 --> 34:29.533
Wow.

34:29.601 --> 34:32.269
Meet dasharra,
aka queen dynamite.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.708
I thought for sure
you were gonna be, like, 6'2".

34:40.879 --> 34:42.546
I mean, you have this,
like, huge presence

34:42.581 --> 34:43.914
even though you're so small.

34:43.949 --> 34:46.950
I'm happy that
I made it here, okay?

34:46.952 --> 34:49.386
- Listen.
- You made it really far.

34:49.421 --> 34:51.388
Dasharra: I made it.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.390
I kind of put
everything behind me,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.624
like, when I had my children,

34:54.660 --> 34:57.194
I kind of forgot
about being a singer.

34:57.229 --> 35:01.731
And honestly,
I feel like "alter ego"
and queen dynamite--

35:01.767 --> 35:03.900
which I love her so much--

35:03.902 --> 35:05.902
she just helped me
get back out there

35:05.938 --> 35:08.238
and face whatever fears
I did have.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.540
You know,
any lack of confidence
I did have,

35:10.576 --> 35:11.808
I don't have that anymore.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.579
So I'm just very thankful
for queen dynamite, yes?

35:17.116 --> 35:20.250
Don't stop,
because you have so much light,

35:20.319 --> 35:21.384
and you light up the room.

35:21.420 --> 35:24.020
And your voice
has a similar power

35:24.056 --> 35:26.990
- to mary j's voice.
- Thank you.

35:27.025 --> 35:30.594
We need that joy,
that uplifting in life,

35:30.629 --> 35:35.065
- and you have
something powerful.
- Thank you so much.

35:35.100 --> 35:38.869
Is there anything that you would
like to say to queen dynamite?

35:38.871 --> 35:41.505
Queen dynamite,
I love you so much.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.574
- Like...
- ( crowd whooping )

35:49.548 --> 35:55.018
she has brought me
a lot of peace, a lot of joy.

35:55.087 --> 35:58.755
'cause, you know,
sometimes you just
don't believe you can do it.

35:58.790 --> 36:01.057
But, I mean, queen dynamite,
she can do it.

36:02.227 --> 36:05.529
- Rocsi: Dasharra,
thank you so much.
- Thank you.

36:05.564 --> 36:08.431
And as we say goodbye
to queen dynamite,

36:08.467 --> 36:12.302
wolfgang champagne
and night journey
await their fate.

36:12.304 --> 36:15.472
One more identity
will be revealed later tonight.

36:15.507 --> 36:19.576
Do not go anywhere.
We'll be right back with more
"alter ego" after this.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.983
Welcome back.

36:27.019 --> 36:30.353
It's been an action-packed night
tonight on "alter ego,"

36:30.389 --> 36:33.890
and now only
two alter egos remain.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.859
Wolfgang champagne,

36:35.861 --> 36:38.728
he has been a fan favorite
and frontrunner.

36:38.797 --> 36:43.066
And night journey, she has
connected with the audience
and touched our souls.

36:43.068 --> 36:48.238
The judges can only save
one of them,

36:48.273 --> 36:51.341
and that alter ego
will move on to the finale.

36:52.911 --> 36:57.414
( crowd howling )

36:57.482 --> 36:58.548
wolfy!

36:58.584 --> 37:01.818
- ( crowd shouting )
- judges?

37:01.820 --> 37:05.722
Wolfy, I just want you to know
that you have really moved me,

37:05.791 --> 37:08.892
and I was incredibly impressed
by your artistry.

37:08.927 --> 37:11.828
And then, night journey,
I can feel your pathos
when you sing.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.898
So, I'm going to...

37:14.933 --> 37:16.466
Save night journey.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.902
That's one vote
for night journey.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.704
Nick?

37:20.739 --> 37:23.206
Wolfy, I mean, look,
as we've said all along,

37:23.275 --> 37:25.675
you are--
you're an entertainer.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.211
And, night journey,
your emotional connection

37:28.280 --> 37:31.748
to what you're singing
is really, really contagious.

37:31.783 --> 37:36.052
And it's a really
difficult decision, but...

37:36.088 --> 37:38.154
( howls )

37:41.193 --> 37:43.827
there's just something
I cannot get enough of
with this guy,

37:43.862 --> 37:46.062
and I wanna see him
in the final, so...

37:46.098 --> 37:48.498
Rocsi:
That's one vote for wolfy,

37:48.533 --> 37:50.467
one vote for night journey.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.701
Will?

37:51.737 --> 37:55.071
So there's a part of me
that's, like, dang,

37:55.073 --> 37:56.740
I need wolfy in my life.

37:58.577 --> 38:03.847
But the artist that's complete
is night journey.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.348
So, night journey.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.853
That is two votes
for night journey,

38:09.888 --> 38:12.055
one vote for wolfy.

38:12.090 --> 38:14.257
There's only one vote left.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.426
If this ends up in a tie,

38:16.461 --> 38:19.129
it goes back
to the studio audience.

38:19.164 --> 38:22.265
( crowd murmuring )

38:22.301 --> 38:23.533
alanis?

38:23.568 --> 38:26.369
Alanis:
People love you, wolfgang.

38:26.438 --> 38:28.138
You aren't easily categorized.

38:28.173 --> 38:31.374
And part of what I love
about your not being
so easily categorized

38:31.410 --> 38:33.743
is that I actually in some ways
also relate to it.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.579
Because when
I was first making music,
people would say to me,

38:36.615 --> 38:37.914
"well, what are you?

38:37.949 --> 38:40.750
Are you alternative?
Are you rock? Are you pop?

38:40.786 --> 38:43.887
What are you?", you know?
And I would just say, "yes."

38:44.956 --> 38:46.756
and I feel that from you.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.592
Night journey,
we were talking earlier about

38:49.628 --> 38:51.795
who we would imagine
at award shows

38:51.830 --> 38:54.264
or shows in general,
who we could see there.

38:54.266 --> 38:56.866
I do think it could
very well be night journey,

38:56.902 --> 38:58.435
so I'm choosing night journey.

39:02.574 --> 39:05.608
Rocsi:
And there you have it.

39:05.644 --> 39:09.979
Congratulations.
You are advancing to the finale.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.349
We will see you there.

39:14.219 --> 39:16.052
It really breaks my heart
to say this,

39:16.088 --> 39:18.888
but it is the end
of your journey here

39:18.924 --> 39:20.724
and your time at "alter ego."

39:20.792 --> 39:23.360
but would you sing one last time

39:23.428 --> 39:26.162
and come out here
and meet everyone in person?

39:26.231 --> 39:27.931
No! I lost!

39:27.966 --> 39:32.702
I'm going home, putting my tail
between my legs!

39:32.738 --> 39:36.673
It would be greatest honor
to come out and meet you all
and sing for you.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.943
Whoo!
( howls )

39:39.978 --> 39:42.946
rocsi: Everyone, give it up
for wolfgang champagne!

39:42.981 --> 39:45.582
Crowd: Wolfy! Wolfy!
Wolfy! Wolfy!

39:45.584 --> 39:49.085
I gotta say, I am incredibly
curious to meet wolfy.

39:50.188 --> 39:51.621
Alanis: Yes.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.395

41:29.154 --> 41:33.356

Wolfy! Wolfy!

41:33.391 --> 41:36.292
I didn't think I was
gonna be crying already.

41:36.361 --> 41:37.894
Oh, my gosh.

41:37.963 --> 41:41.798
- I'm so sad to see you go.
- Not as sad as I am!

41:43.101 --> 41:45.869
Oh, my goodness.
Judges, this is the human

41:45.904 --> 41:47.971
behind wolfgang champagne,

41:48.006 --> 41:51.140
aka matthew.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.077
I don't even know
how to say this

41:54.079 --> 41:56.713
because I'm gonna tear up.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.915
I am 60 years old.

41:58.917 --> 42:00.316
And someone said to me
the other day,

42:00.352 --> 42:01.451
"you're middle-aged."

42:01.520 --> 42:04.254
and I said,
"only if I live to 120."

42:05.624 --> 42:08.458
first off, you guys
made me feel relevant.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.593
You made me feel that
as that long as I'm breathing,

42:10.629 --> 42:13.196
something really cool
can happen.

42:13.231 --> 42:16.032
I was sleeping in the back
of a truck eight weeks ago.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.233
And now you're here
in hollywood.

42:17.269 --> 42:20.603
And now I'm here
making rocsi cry.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.939
( howling )

42:22.974 --> 42:24.841
we've seen
so many sides of wolfy,

42:24.876 --> 42:26.910
so it's been awesome
to have you on the show,

42:26.912 --> 42:29.345
and I wish you could
go all the way.

42:30.549 --> 42:32.916
You talk about what the show
has given you.

42:32.951 --> 42:35.385
I just hope you can truly
appreciate and you recognize

42:35.420 --> 42:37.320
and realize what
you've given to this show.

42:41.326 --> 42:44.761
Wow. Two bittersweet goodbyes,
but a very exciting night

42:44.796 --> 42:47.764
for misty rose
and night journey,

42:47.799 --> 42:51.434
who have advanced to the finale.

42:51.436 --> 42:56.539
It won't be long
before we have our first
next generation superstar

42:56.608 --> 42:58.708
standing right here
on this stage.

42:58.743 --> 43:02.378
Come back next week
for the second night
of semi-finals. Good night.
