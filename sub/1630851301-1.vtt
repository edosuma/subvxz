WEBVTT

02:00.303 --> 02:01.805
Mom!

02:02.705 --> 02:04.241
The delivery guy's here!

02:04.274 --> 02:06.944
With Melvin's... weird shit.

02:12.816 --> 02:14.786
Enjoying the show?

02:24.294 --> 02:26.231
He wants it in the basement.

02:41.345 --> 02:45.615
This thing is heavy.
I might need a small hand.

02:45.649 --> 02:48.686
I have small hands! See?

02:53.190 --> 02:54.758
Melvin!

02:57.828 --> 02:59.931
Go call your stepfather.

03:05.703 --> 03:07.238
Melvin!

03:13.843 --> 03:15.680
Hey, professor g!

03:15.712 --> 03:17.715
Ah! Yes, young Danny, yes!

03:17.747 --> 03:19.550
Are you going to do
a show this year?

03:20.684 --> 03:23.120
Well, I don't know
about that, louisie and I,

03:23.152 --> 03:27.291
we've been having a lot of trouble
with Carolina, and all her drama.

03:27.323 --> 03:29.960
Aw, come on, you
didn't do one last year either!

03:29.994 --> 03:31.329
Yeah, we miss it!

03:31.362 --> 03:33.197
That's like Halloween for us!

03:33.229 --> 03:35.600
Are you still
building your museum?

03:35.632 --> 03:38.168
Ah, yes. Yes.

03:38.202 --> 03:41.072
The amazing museum
of the macabre.

03:41.104 --> 03:43.139
Yes, yes, I will.

03:43.173 --> 03:44.875
But I'll tell you what.

03:44.907 --> 03:47.043
If you stop
by after trick or treating,

03:47.077 --> 03:51.048
I promise I will have something
for you, something, uh,

03:51.080 --> 03:53.017
something special,
I promise you.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.217
Like what?

03:54.251 --> 03:56.120
Something that just might be

03:56.152 --> 03:59.656
the prized piece
of my entire collection.

03:59.690 --> 04:02.393
I call her... masquerade.

04:02.425 --> 04:06.196
- Her?
- El demonia de la mascarada.

04:07.698 --> 04:11.235
The skeleton of a young woman
who was besieged by a curse.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.137
A curse they called...

04:13.169 --> 04:15.039
Being under the moon,
young friends.

04:15.071 --> 04:16.773
What does that mean?

04:16.805 --> 04:19.009
It means you still breathe.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.144
Live in the natural world,

04:21.177 --> 04:23.780
but your soul
has been disembodied.

04:23.813 --> 04:25.650
And is now trapped in hell.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.953
Now according to the witches
that cursed her,

04:28.986 --> 04:33.224
time here, and time down in hell
are very, very different.

04:33.256 --> 04:35.258
Like, how?

04:35.292 --> 04:40.364
One minute here, is like
a million years down below.

04:40.397 --> 04:42.700
This sounds
awesome, professor g,

04:42.732 --> 04:44.201
does she come awake
at Halloween?

04:45.436 --> 04:48.104
No. She's just bones
at this point,

04:48.138 --> 04:51.308
bones in a box,
for old collectors like me.

04:51.340 --> 04:54.044
And you should buy it,
just for your museum.

04:54.078 --> 04:58.315
I intend to, sir, in fact, I
have a date with her right now,

04:58.347 --> 05:01.051
so I bid you all
a temporary farewell,

05:01.085 --> 05:03.821
but if one of you, or all of you
would like to come by

05:03.854 --> 05:06.890
after trick or treating, we'll
be waiting for you tonight.

05:08.258 --> 05:09.327
Bye-bye now.

05:10.927 --> 05:12.228
Bye-bye.

05:16.967 --> 05:19.136
The Harley brothers,
are going to be very happy

05:19.169 --> 05:21.472
that you decided
to help them, Richard.

05:21.504 --> 05:24.408
- Do I have a choice?
- Do any of us anymore?

05:25.775 --> 05:26.775
I should.

05:27.443 --> 05:29.780
I've done my time, Finn.

05:29.813 --> 05:31.883
I earned the right
to walk away on my own terms.

05:33.850 --> 05:35.318
Of course you have.

05:36.487 --> 05:38.489
This'll be fast and easy.

05:38.522 --> 05:40.791
You'll be set up
for a long time, Richard.

05:40.823 --> 05:43.927
Consider it, uh, a thank you.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.997
From the Harley brothers,
going to get you on the road to

05:48.030 --> 05:50.001
being the father,
you always should've been.

05:52.136 --> 05:53.871
All I need is when and where.

05:58.075 --> 05:59.077
I like that.

06:08.018 --> 06:09.119
What's that?

06:10.087 --> 06:12.023
That's the physical address.

06:13.823 --> 06:15.893
The street's one you know.

06:15.926 --> 06:17.995
You and my father grew up there,

06:18.027 --> 06:20.765
before it became
a rich man's neighborhood.

06:21.931 --> 06:23.801
I'm not doing this alone.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.935
You know I have a partner.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.171
You mean, your daughter.

06:28.438 --> 06:31.542
You don't have to qualify it.
She's my partner.

06:31.575 --> 06:33.945
She's also the best locksmith
in the region.

06:35.445 --> 06:37.215
So where the fuck is she?

06:38.482 --> 06:41.486
She's getting the supplies.
And the car.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.089
Mouse is getting the car.

06:48.191 --> 06:49.259
Richard.

06:52.261 --> 06:54.164
Nothing that attracts attention.

06:57.568 --> 06:58.568
Right?

07:08.078 --> 07:09.847
Hey! My wallet!

07:09.879 --> 07:11.314
Sorry not sorry!

07:37.975 --> 07:40.111
Fuck you!

07:42.078 --> 07:45.148
I know I'm hell of a late,
I got everything ready.

07:45.181 --> 07:47.116
Got some dope costumes.

07:47.150 --> 07:50.154
And there's a pink bear there
with your name on it, dad.

07:52.289 --> 07:54.425
- Kidding.
- Costumes?

07:55.325 --> 07:58.128
It's a smuggler's house
on Halloween.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.163
We're not sneaking in.

08:00.196 --> 08:02.032
So you're doing what exactly?

08:03.133 --> 08:06.270
Walking right up
to the front door, and knocking.

08:08.972 --> 08:10.875
That is fantastic.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.078
Just plant the folder where
the cops find it. Get the money.

08:14.111 --> 08:17.014
The you can retire. Go off and
be fucking father of the year.

08:18.047 --> 08:21.985
I fucking love that everybody
thinks I'm retiring too.

08:24.688 --> 08:26.023
One more thing.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.359
You're not going to like it.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.429
But I'm afraid
I'm going to have to insist.

08:33.297 --> 08:34.631
Always one more thing.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.902
Percy's going with you.

08:41.171 --> 08:43.273
He's your muscle, Richard.

08:44.340 --> 08:46.310
And this is
not fucking negotiable.

08:47.978 --> 08:50.681
Maybe I can get
that pink bear costume to Percy?

08:50.714 --> 08:54.352
I think that he needs a little
bit of pink in his life.

08:55.551 --> 08:59.255
I don't work
with people like Percy.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.423
I don't like guns.

09:01.358 --> 09:02.493
He's going with you.

09:03.594 --> 09:06.129
You're picking him up
after his little shakedown.

09:06.162 --> 09:08.132
You're going to
complete the mission,

09:08.165 --> 09:11.101
help the Harley brothers,
and then you can ride off

09:11.133 --> 09:13.003
into the fucking sunset.

09:13.036 --> 09:15.172
His little shakedown?

09:15.205 --> 09:17.206
I can just imagine.

09:17.239 --> 09:20.043
It's just a little scare tactic.
That's all.

09:22.111 --> 09:23.111
Come here.

09:24.681 --> 09:27.151
Percy is sick.

09:27.183 --> 09:29.585
And I don't want
him around my daughter.

09:29.619 --> 09:32.189
Christ, everyone's talking
like I'm not even here.

09:32.221 --> 09:35.558
- I can fucking handle my shit, dad!
- Stop!

09:38.995 --> 09:39.995
Richard.

09:40.596 --> 09:42.600
He's under your command tonight.

09:44.100 --> 09:45.601
Besides.

09:45.634 --> 09:47.638
Percy is misunderstood.

09:49.071 --> 09:50.340
You should cut him some slack.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.022
Get me the phone,
and dial Percy.

10:12.162 --> 10:13.497
Oh!

10:26.609 --> 10:28.678
Hey, dumb-ass,
take my shotgun out.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.085
Take my shotgun out.

10:39.189 --> 10:40.291
Good girl.

10:46.463 --> 10:48.699
Yeah, she looks
all innocent now.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.736
She's going to grow up
to be just like you.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.073
A woman.

10:57.773 --> 11:00.110
And women are
only good for two things.

11:01.378 --> 11:04.415
Getting fucked,
and talking shit.

11:06.215 --> 11:09.019
And we know you have
a big fucking mouth, don't we?

11:12.354 --> 11:13.390
What about this?

11:14.557 --> 11:16.494
Open your legs,
you fucking whore.

11:19.262 --> 11:21.065
Can that take both barrels, huh?

11:26.103 --> 11:27.104
Mm.

11:29.806 --> 11:32.176
What about that
big fucking mouth, huh?

11:33.109 --> 11:35.479
No! Please.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.816
Sir, please, don't hurt me,
please.

11:41.884 --> 11:45.321
This big mouth can take this
whole thing, can't it? Huh?

11:49.658 --> 11:51.194
You make me sick.

11:55.599 --> 11:56.834
Get this in there.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.070
Come on!

12:01.305 --> 12:04.275
What do you think, dumb-ass,
can she do it? Can mommy do it?

12:07.409 --> 12:09.446
All that big mouth bullshit...

12:10.513 --> 12:13.417
And you can't fit this
in that big fucking mouth.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.354
Piece of shit.

12:23.225 --> 12:24.427
I have an idea...

12:25.561 --> 12:27.163
Let's make that hole bigger.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.368
- Percy.
- <i>Richard and mouse think they're done working</i>

13:04.401 --> 13:05.469
<i>with the Harley brothers.</i>

13:05.502 --> 13:07.838
Ah, the golden boy.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.806
<i>Yeah, well, there's a big payout
tonight if you end these motherfuckers.</i>

13:10.840 --> 13:12.508
For killing Richard and mouse?

13:12.542 --> 13:15.412
Shit. I'd have
done that for free.

13:59.589 --> 14:02.560
I guess I'm not so bad at
this Halloween stuff after all.

14:31.021 --> 14:32.256
Ah...

14:33.056 --> 14:34.725
La demonia...

14:36.725 --> 14:37.994
Join me if you'd like.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.631
This is the first time
human eyes have laid

14:41.665 --> 14:44.235
on her in over a century!

14:45.435 --> 14:47.638
The cute guy
that helped me move it down here

14:47.671 --> 14:49.672
says it smells like cat piss.

14:49.705 --> 14:50.907
I tend to agree.

14:54.009 --> 14:56.612
Don't worry,
I'm not going to date him.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.882
Mom said, he
only makes minimum wage,

14:58.915 --> 15:00.651
and I ain't got time for that.

15:01.551 --> 15:04.287
No, no, I'm not.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.657
I'm not worried,
I actually thought

15:06.690 --> 15:08.892
you two would
make a lovely couple.

15:09.859 --> 15:11.427
He's in
his thirties and probably

15:11.460 --> 15:13.430
lives in a trailer, so...

15:13.463 --> 15:15.966
- You're almost 40.
- But I live in a house.

15:18.534 --> 15:20.536
No, no...

15:30.446 --> 15:32.482
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.888
Yes.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.894
Yo, so that's got to suck,
huh, Melvin?

15:47.497 --> 15:50.401
Beauty is only skin deep,
Caroline.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.570
Now, I wouldn't agree with this,
but some would say

15:53.603 --> 15:56.640
she's the most beautiful
girl in the room.

16:01.143 --> 16:04.715
Anyway, come on, come on.
Let's get this up on the ledge.

16:06.383 --> 16:08.852
This is
a lot of work on a holiday.

16:08.884 --> 16:09.952
Gosh!

16:12.555 --> 16:16.560
And by the way, Melvin.
She's got no skin.

16:18.161 --> 16:20.873
Just come on, just come on. All right?
Just come on, lift it up, will you?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.766
Easy. Come on!

16:22.798 --> 16:24.900
Easy!

16:24.933 --> 16:27.436
- Lift it!
- I'm trying.

16:27.470 --> 16:29.440
Ah! God!

16:31.840 --> 16:33.042
Pay attention!

16:34.911 --> 16:39.015
I can't ask you to do anything
without you screwing something up!

16:39.047 --> 16:40.149
God!

16:48.056 --> 16:50.494
Louisie! I need a hand!

16:52.428 --> 16:55.064
Melvin, you know
I don't like dark places!

16:59.034 --> 17:00.034
God!

17:01.904 --> 17:03.506
I just need some help
setting this up,

17:03.540 --> 17:05.575
could you get
your heiny down here?

17:05.608 --> 17:06.675
Okay.

17:08.011 --> 17:09.012
I'm coming.

17:19.722 --> 17:21.958
Ew! It's a bone.

17:21.991 --> 17:24.493
Will you just grab
a corner, please!

17:24.526 --> 17:26.695
- I can't, I just can't.
- Ah...

17:27.863 --> 17:29.498
Then tell your daughter

17:29.532 --> 17:32.535
to get her ass down here
and help, just once!

17:33.570 --> 17:35.071
Oh, now there it is.

17:35.103 --> 17:37.072
Now you're going to sit there

17:37.106 --> 17:40.444
with your mouth hanging open,
just like her!

17:40.476 --> 17:42.579
Oh, jeez!

17:42.611 --> 17:44.648
Oh, god!

17:44.680 --> 17:48.918
You know, I can't.
I'm just... I, I just cannot

17:48.952 --> 17:52.823
seem to do what
I want to do in this house.

17:52.856 --> 17:55.725
I'm paying for something
that isn't even mine!

17:56.859 --> 18:02.732
I'm living in a house with a
stepdaughter who's almost 40 years old,

18:02.764 --> 18:06.002
and unable
to be self sufficient!

18:06.034 --> 18:09.973
And therefor she's
like a pet we have to feed!

18:10.907 --> 18:12.576
Yeah!

18:12.609 --> 18:15.978
But her life expectancy
is greater than ours.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.714
Yeah, so she's here forever!

18:19.014 --> 18:20.984
And it's heartbreaking to me!

18:21.016 --> 18:23.820
Yeah, no, no, no, you're
going to listen all of this,

18:23.852 --> 18:26.489
oh, no, don't cry,
you're going to listen to all of this,

18:26.523 --> 18:29.658
because the night is ruined!

18:29.692 --> 18:32.162
This whole night is ruined,
I have a coffin

18:32.195 --> 18:35.031
that I can't now set up
in the window for the neighbors

18:35.063 --> 18:37.600
to see and do you know why?

18:37.634 --> 18:41.905
Because my wife
is afraid of the dark!

18:41.937 --> 18:43.273
Oh, that's right!

18:43.305 --> 18:45.542
But she doesn't seem
to have a problem

18:45.574 --> 18:49.979
at night when she's got her head
buried in those books, huh?

18:50.013 --> 18:52.849
Why? Why don't you seem
to have a problem then, louisie?

18:52.881 --> 18:54.283
I mean, it's
perfectly dark then.

18:54.317 --> 18:57.854
Why aren't you crying
all night then?

18:57.887 --> 18:58.922
Huh?

19:00.290 --> 19:02.725
Because I'm with you.

19:05.194 --> 19:06.530
What?

19:06.562 --> 19:07.930
Aw, shit!

19:08.865 --> 19:11.768
Because, I'm... oh! I'm with you?

19:11.801 --> 19:14.538
I'm with you?

19:14.571 --> 19:17.674
Ah! You are kidding me! Ah!

19:17.706 --> 19:19.609
Because I'm with you?

19:19.641 --> 19:23.846
I'm with you,
she says. Jesus Christ!

19:38.328 --> 19:41.898
Melvin! This is a chair leg!

19:43.866 --> 19:45.836
You got ripped off again.

19:47.337 --> 19:49.540
Rags and chair legs.

20:19.401 --> 20:20.703
Melvin!

20:29.344 --> 20:32.782
Melvin! Please, get down here!

20:33.683 --> 20:34.917
Melvin!

20:38.920 --> 20:43.826
Melvin, come here!

20:43.859 --> 20:46.228
Hold on, louisie...

20:46.262 --> 20:47.262
Please!

21:38.046 --> 21:39.081
Louisie!

21:40.817 --> 21:41.918
The power's out!

21:48.090 --> 21:49.158
I'm coming, louisie.

21:52.829 --> 21:55.065
Melvin!

21:55.098 --> 21:56.299
It's me.

21:56.331 --> 21:57.434
That's Melvin.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.696
Get off her!

22:40.976 --> 22:41.976
Got you!

22:57.193 --> 22:59.395
<i>Are they still fighting?</i>

22:59.427 --> 23:03.532
I don't know,
Melvin's like such a nerd.

23:03.565 --> 23:06.401
He never did
any stupid shit like my dad.

23:08.503 --> 23:10.807
<i>Dude, what's going on?</i>

23:10.840 --> 23:13.877
I... I think they're inside.

23:16.445 --> 23:17.981
Louisie, my god!

23:19.948 --> 23:21.016
Oh! Louisie!

23:23.319 --> 23:24.454
Oh, my god!

23:26.254 --> 23:28.457
Shit!

23:36.965 --> 23:38.001
Shit!

23:42.271 --> 23:44.107
Let me in, Melvin...

23:46.108 --> 23:49.412
I... I got to go. Call me later,
I'll let you know.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.284
I need help.

23:56.218 --> 23:57.553
Oh, my god.

23:59.955 --> 24:01.123
Caroline!

24:02.457 --> 24:04.459
Louisie... oh!

24:04.493 --> 24:07.563
Hurry! Your mother's hurt bad!

24:07.597 --> 24:09.532
Oh, Jesus! Louisie.

24:09.564 --> 24:10.900
Oh, louisie...

24:13.135 --> 24:15.171
Oh, louisie.
Hey, get the medical kit.

24:15.204 --> 24:18.241
Get the medical kit!
Hurry, get the medical kit!

24:18.273 --> 24:19.273
Oh, louisie.

24:25.648 --> 24:26.983
What happened...

24:28.618 --> 24:31.154
I think it's
the vampire, louisie.

24:31.186 --> 24:34.556
Oh, no, no, no. I know
it sounds impossible, but

24:34.590 --> 24:37.226
it bit you,
holy shit, it bit you!

24:37.260 --> 24:41.196
Oh, it picked you up by your
damn head and it bit your neck!

24:41.230 --> 24:43.466
Oh, god, it was over
by the door.

24:43.498 --> 24:47.102
And it came...
I saw it couldn't come through the door.

24:47.136 --> 24:49.138
It couldn't come to...

24:49.170 --> 24:52.941
I told you to get the damn medical
kit, from the fucking pantry!

24:52.975 --> 24:54.142
Get the medical kit!

24:56.512 --> 24:57.580
Melvin...

24:59.215 --> 25:00.884
She is all I've got.

25:03.151 --> 25:05.554
You're the only thing
she has now.

25:06.621 --> 25:09.124
I love her,
please take care of her...

25:16.666 --> 25:18.434
Louisie...

25:18.466 --> 25:20.270
Oh, god!

25:20.302 --> 25:21.638
Oh, god, no!

25:23.238 --> 25:26.042
Weezy. Weezy. Weezy!

25:26.074 --> 25:29.178
I promise if you just stay with
me, if you just stay with me...

25:30.178 --> 25:31.690
I promise I'll never
yell at her again,

25:31.714 --> 25:34.117
I'll never,
I'll never yell at her again,

25:34.149 --> 25:36.253
do you hear me?
Do you hear me, weezy!

25:37.218 --> 25:38.987
Weezy! Do you hear me?

25:39.021 --> 25:41.224
I promise you, I will
never yell at her again!

25:50.699 --> 25:53.135
- Mouse...
- Fuck, dad, stop.

25:53.168 --> 25:54.638
Jesus fucking Christ.

26:14.622 --> 26:16.992
Who is it! Oh, shit
it's the trick or treaters!

26:17.025 --> 26:19.262
Oh, Jesus Christ!
It must be the neighbors kids!

26:23.733 --> 26:26.703
- This looks fucked.
- Keep your fucking tampon in, I got it.

26:26.735 --> 26:28.137
Fuck off.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.538
All right, I'll go get them!

26:29.571 --> 26:31.306
Caroline. Caroline!

26:31.340 --> 26:33.510
Okay. Eureka, bitch!

26:38.647 --> 26:40.350
- What the hell?
- Fuck!

26:41.617 --> 26:43.418
What the hell
are you doing in my house?

26:45.654 --> 26:48.424
- We're here for the money, bitch.
- Mouse!

26:48.456 --> 26:50.592
We don't have any money
lying around in this house.

26:50.626 --> 26:52.028
Percy!

26:52.061 --> 26:53.330
Shut your fucking mouth.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.738
Caroline, goddammit, I need you!

27:06.708 --> 27:09.144
That was a big fucking mistake.

27:16.452 --> 27:18.154
Be cool, Percy. Be cool!

27:38.073 --> 27:39.574
Okay? It's all right, okay?

27:39.608 --> 27:42.378
Listen, listen!
You've got a job to do.

27:43.478 --> 27:44.746
Stay in the game. Go!

27:44.780 --> 27:45.780
Come on.

27:50.351 --> 27:52.589
Motherfucker! Now...

27:53.522 --> 27:56.591
I was going to rape your daughter
while you were still alive,

27:56.625 --> 27:58.061
so you could watch!

27:59.160 --> 28:01.330
But you're just
going to have to trust me.

28:01.362 --> 28:03.632
I'm going to
make it fucking slow,

28:03.666 --> 28:05.068
and painful.

28:07.535 --> 28:08.535
Fuck this.

28:12.174 --> 28:14.609
Oh. That's a nice knife.

28:14.642 --> 28:16.311
I'm going to fuck you with that.

28:16.344 --> 28:17.646
Fuck you, Percy!

28:20.349 --> 28:21.451
No, no.

28:22.584 --> 28:24.553
- No!
- Goodnight, bitch!

28:50.678 --> 28:52.114
Oh, my god.

28:57.253 --> 28:58.620
Here, here, here, here.

29:03.892 --> 29:04.892
Caroline...

29:05.727 --> 29:07.496
I need you to help
with your mom.

29:08.597 --> 29:10.733
She's not doing so well.

29:16.605 --> 29:17.640
Come on, daddy.

29:18.741 --> 29:21.411
Aren't you going to help
your daughter? Come on, daddy!

29:22.410 --> 29:23.645
You're pathetic.

29:26.415 --> 29:28.184
How do you want to die?

29:28.216 --> 29:30.585
Do you want me
to choke you to death?

29:30.619 --> 29:32.788
Or do you want to die
by this knife,

29:32.821 --> 29:35.558
that's going to have your
daughter's cunt blood on it, huh?

29:49.437 --> 29:51.439
Nice try, you little bitch.

30:26.242 --> 30:28.311
Okay, you psycho bitch.

30:48.696 --> 30:51.867
That's right. On your knees.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.283
Fuck!

32:05.808 --> 32:06.975
Dad, what happened?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.583
What happened to mom?

32:14.949 --> 32:17.052
I'm scared!

32:24.993 --> 32:26.663
I can't explain any of it.

32:28.763 --> 32:32.635
Can it get any worse?
Can it? Can it?

32:38.940 --> 32:40.709
This is our goddamn house.

32:45.414 --> 32:46.849
This is our goddamn house.

32:51.853 --> 32:56.758
And nobody, is going to
prevent us from saving weezy.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.561
You hear me?

33:02.164 --> 33:03.164
Nobody.

33:27.822 --> 33:29.492
I think I'm fucked up.

33:31.025 --> 33:32.628
You don't have time to be.

33:35.464 --> 33:38.067
Jesus fucking Christ!

33:38.100 --> 33:39.502
Listen.

33:39.534 --> 33:41.003
Percy's dead.

33:41.035 --> 33:43.905
Right? I mean deader than dead.

33:43.938 --> 33:47.542
We're in a world of hurt,
we got to get out of here.

33:47.576 --> 33:50.613
- What about the people who live here?
- Not our problem.

33:50.646 --> 33:52.013
And what about the money?

33:52.046 --> 33:54.383
- We don't need...
- I need it!

33:55.751 --> 33:56.886
I need the money.

34:00.522 --> 34:01.522
Okay.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.501
All right, give me your hand.

34:17.940 --> 34:24.514
<i>Truco...
O-trato... truco...</i> Trick.

34:26.848 --> 34:29.851
Trick... <i>O</i> treat.

34:33.922 --> 34:36.025
Trick or treat!

34:52.507 --> 34:53.507
Okay.

34:55.810 --> 34:58.780
You see that girl, you run.

34:58.813 --> 35:01.716
Whatever you do,
do not look into her eyes.

35:03.118 --> 35:04.953
Dad, you're freaking me out.

35:04.987 --> 35:06.822
Do what I say.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.926
No matter how crazy it sounds.
We still got to job to do.

35:20.235 --> 35:21.571
What the fuck?

35:25.172 --> 35:26.908
Okay.

35:26.942 --> 35:29.144
We stay focused, we get
the money, and we get out.

35:29.177 --> 35:31.947
- But what if there is no money?
- There's money!

35:31.980 --> 35:33.648
Percy was going crazy over it.

35:45.192 --> 35:47.428
Hey. Dad, a little help?

35:51.299 --> 35:54.002
Mouse, get
your head in the game!

35:55.938 --> 35:57.240
Oh, my head is in the game.

35:58.574 --> 36:03.311
My head is fucking scrambled,

36:03.344 --> 36:06.714
but it's in the game enough to know
that you're freaking the fuck out!

36:06.748 --> 36:08.551
And you never
freak out about anything!

36:12.321 --> 36:15.290
And I'm s... I'm scared.

36:16.725 --> 36:18.627
And I don't know
what the fuck is out there!

36:27.868 --> 36:29.237
We got set up, didn't we?

36:31.639 --> 36:33.641
That's not
what I'm worried about.

36:33.674 --> 36:35.310
That girl out there, she's...

36:38.045 --> 36:39.281
She did things.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.819
She did things that are
physically impossible to do.

36:46.822 --> 36:48.925
We'll get the money
but that's the easy part.

36:50.324 --> 36:52.093
Getting out of here
is going to be hell.

36:54.228 --> 36:55.297
Who is she?

36:57.898 --> 36:59.034
What is she?

37:00.835 --> 37:01.835
I don't know.

37:06.842 --> 37:07.877
Hey, look.

37:10.679 --> 37:12.359
I haven't always been
a good father to you.

37:13.281 --> 37:15.250
- But...
- No, just don't. Don't.

37:16.784 --> 37:17.784
Don't start.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.623
Look, don't get me wrong.

37:21.956 --> 37:25.860
Mom was a shitbag and I'm glad
you were the one that stepped in.

37:25.893 --> 37:27.996
- Yeah, she was a nasty woman.
- Yeah.

37:31.065 --> 37:36.304
But... you've never said
I love you in your entire life.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.842
So why start now?

38:03.065 --> 38:04.065
Weezy?

38:05.366 --> 38:06.801
Weezy, can you hear me?

38:13.308 --> 38:14.377
What a night, huh?

38:20.915 --> 38:23.284
I hope you can hear me
in your dreams, my love.

38:26.822 --> 38:28.157
My little weezy.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.067
I am so...

38:40.402 --> 38:41.804
So sorry.

38:42.938 --> 38:44.306
For the things I said.

38:47.976 --> 38:51.013
I'm so sorry for leaving you
in the dark in that moment.

38:55.951 --> 38:56.985
I failed you.

39:00.388 --> 39:02.090
I brought that thing here.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.929
I've ruined everything!

39:12.868 --> 39:14.228
But I'm going to
make things right.

39:18.038 --> 39:19.475
I'm going to make things right!

39:33.420 --> 39:35.991
Oh, dear god. Oh, dear god!

39:38.092 --> 39:40.061
Go, go, go!

39:45.467 --> 39:48.471
Professor g
putting on a show tonight!

39:49.837 --> 39:51.873
Guys! Guys! Get out of here!

39:51.906 --> 39:53.441
Go! Show is canceled!

39:53.475 --> 39:56.377
Wait! No, don't go there, no!

39:56.411 --> 39:59.081
- Whoa!
- No, no, Danny. Danny!

39:59.114 --> 40:00.791
Get your sister
and get the hell out of here!

40:00.815 --> 40:02.518
Oh, snap,
there's the demon girl!

40:07.556 --> 40:09.858
Danny! Danny, look, look!

40:09.891 --> 40:12.094
Danny, it's canceled,
there's not going to be a show!

40:12.127 --> 40:14.137
- Get your sister and get the fuck out of here!
- Professor g,

40:14.161 --> 40:16.264
- this shit is lit!
- Danny!

40:16.297 --> 40:18.866
I'm telling you this isn't a
show, would you get your sister?

40:18.900 --> 40:21.336
Danny, just get your sister
yourself and get her out of here!

40:21.368 --> 40:23.471
Danny, are you listening to me!

40:23.505 --> 40:24.874
There's kid out there!

40:27.976 --> 40:29.478
Rosie! Rosie!

40:31.513 --> 40:35.016
Hey, get the fuck out of here!
Go home!

40:35.049 --> 40:37.552
Fucking Halloween is canceled,
there's no more candy, okay?

40:37.585 --> 40:39.221
Get the fuck out of here!

40:39.253 --> 40:42.257
Hey, I said, get out!

40:42.290 --> 40:45.828
- Leave the...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! You're going to get us killed, come on!

40:54.636 --> 40:57.072
Hey, sis! Come on!

40:57.105 --> 40:58.940
When I say run...

40:58.973 --> 41:00.609
That's a really cool costume.

41:05.947 --> 41:07.349
Run!

41:07.382 --> 41:09.418
- Oh, Jesus, open the door!
- Open the door!

41:09.451 --> 41:11.052
Open the fucking door!

41:11.085 --> 41:13.120
Open the door!

41:15.924 --> 41:17.458
Let my daughter in!

41:17.491 --> 41:18.960
We're not going to hurt you!

41:18.993 --> 41:21.629
The guy who tried
to hurt you is dead!

41:21.663 --> 41:24.032
Come on open the door, please!

41:37.645 --> 41:39.247
Pick the lock.

41:39.281 --> 41:41.183
I can't, my kit's inside!

41:43.685 --> 41:45.186
Pick the lock.

41:51.058 --> 41:53.961
- I love you dad.
- I love you too, kiddo.

41:58.032 --> 42:00.034
I'll buy you some time.

42:04.038 --> 42:05.674
I don't know what you are.

42:05.706 --> 42:07.241
But I've seen you bleed.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.110
And it's all I need.

42:13.581 --> 42:16.218
Sorry, I don't speak that shit!

42:20.188 --> 42:21.456
You cracked my bat!

42:22.357 --> 42:24.259
I'm going to crack your skull!

42:44.279 --> 42:45.514
Excuse me.

42:45.547 --> 42:47.282
Can I use your phone?

42:47.315 --> 42:49.451
I need to tell my mom
my sister's dead.

43:14.542 --> 43:17.378
Die, you fucking shit!

43:19.547 --> 43:22.985
Die until
you can't fucking die anymore!

43:28.623 --> 43:29.691
Fuck you!

43:29.723 --> 43:30.992
Come on.

44:12.433 --> 44:13.701
M... mouse!

44:14.636 --> 44:15.636
Mouse!

44:17.471 --> 44:18.471
Mouse...

44:36.357 --> 44:38.761
No, no, no, no, no! No, no!

44:52.574 --> 44:53.574
Danny!

44:57.145 --> 44:59.815
Danny! Danny!

45:11.259 --> 45:12.293
Danny!

45:15.864 --> 45:17.566
No!

45:18.500 --> 45:20.601
No! Agh!

45:57.237 --> 45:58.306
Come on!

45:59.239 --> 46:01.208
Your name is mouse,
right? Come on.

46:01.241 --> 46:03.711
Come on!
It's dad, you got to fight it!

46:33.373 --> 46:34.408
Choke her.

46:34.442 --> 46:35.543
Dad!

46:36.978 --> 46:39.681
I'll see you in hell!

46:39.714 --> 46:44.786
And I'll fuck you! With
a pitchfork for all eternity!

46:45.752 --> 46:48.589
Choke!

46:52.293 --> 46:53.729
God!

47:13.714 --> 47:14.749
Momma?

47:17.951 --> 47:20.188
Momma, you got to take a sip.

47:21.422 --> 47:22.791
You got to take a sip.

47:29.663 --> 47:31.699
Momma, wake up.

47:36.404 --> 47:38.306
Wake up.

47:38.339 --> 47:40.509
Wake up. Wake up.

47:43.444 --> 47:44.446
Wake up.

47:45.779 --> 47:47.381
Please, don't leave me.

47:52.252 --> 47:55.656
You're the only person in the
whole world that even likes me.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.669
It's Melvin, right?

48:44.038 --> 48:45.840
The kids called me professor g.

48:47.909 --> 48:49.011
I always liked that.

48:50.712 --> 48:53.480
I never knew what the "g"
stood for though,

48:53.514 --> 48:55.350
because my last name
starts with an "s."

48:55.382 --> 48:57.018
Yeah, well, Melvin...

48:59.987 --> 49:02.624
She's going to be
waking up soon.

49:02.656 --> 49:06.360
If I know my daughter,
she's going to be a handful.

49:08.929 --> 49:11.799
Got anything better than
duct tape to restrain her with?

49:11.833 --> 49:14.569
Eh, duct tape's
pretty damn good.

49:14.601 --> 49:16.804
Yeah, it is, Melvin,
but there's not enough of it.

49:16.837 --> 49:19.840
There's probably a ton
of things down there, but...

49:19.873 --> 49:22.009
You know, she was down there.

49:22.043 --> 49:23.612
That's where she bit my wife.

49:26.147 --> 49:28.549
Why hasn't she come through
that door and killed us all?

49:28.583 --> 49:29.651
Hard to say.

49:30.985 --> 49:34.589
Look, we brought her in a box,
and she had no say...

49:35.822 --> 49:37.792
And we never
brought her upstairs.

49:39.594 --> 49:40.903
She cannot
come through that door...

49:40.927 --> 49:43.065
Will you try to make sense?

49:48.735 --> 49:49.735
All right.

49:50.772 --> 49:53.442
I'm not letting my daughter
succumb to that thing.

49:56.911 --> 49:59.914
If we have to kill it to bring
her back, we'll kill it.

49:59.947 --> 50:01.850
Do you even know how to kill it?

50:01.882 --> 50:03.451
You saw what happened.

50:05.420 --> 50:07.522
It is not a thing,
mister, what...

50:08.522 --> 50:10.458
Listen, who the hell
are you anyway?

50:11.625 --> 50:14.395
You come inside my house,
I don't even know your name!

50:14.429 --> 50:15.964
You came in here to Rob me?

50:15.996 --> 50:18.933
- Kill me?
- I did not try to kill you!

50:20.601 --> 50:22.470
Percy tried to kill you!

50:22.502 --> 50:23.771
And Percy's dead.

50:26.641 --> 50:28.042
My name is Richard.

50:28.074 --> 50:30.878
That is my daughter.
And I want to get her,

50:30.911 --> 50:32.813
the hell out of here,
you understand?

50:36.918 --> 50:38.686
We wouldn't be
in this situation,

50:38.719 --> 50:41.590
if you'd opened... the door!

50:42.623 --> 50:43.625
Melvin!

50:45.058 --> 50:47.561
Well, my wife is
in there sick too!

50:47.594 --> 50:50.165
And I could've gotten her
some help if it wasn't for you!

50:51.498 --> 50:54.034
While you do whatever you need
to do for your daughter,

50:54.067 --> 50:55.669
and then I'm going
to find my phone

50:55.703 --> 50:57.706
- and I'm going to call the police.
- Police?

51:02.710 --> 51:04.079
The ambulance, okay?

51:08.715 --> 51:09.918
I'll be quick.

51:13.888 --> 51:14.989
Don't be quick.

51:17.090 --> 51:18.893
Be careful.

51:18.926 --> 51:20.061
Save it.

51:38.712 --> 51:39.712
Speaker?

51:40.748 --> 51:41.850
Play wedding song.

52:01.668 --> 52:02.937
Daddy?

52:06.040 --> 52:08.009
I can feel the worms,

52:08.042 --> 52:10.911
crawling into my eyes,

52:10.944 --> 52:12.580
and into my mouth...

52:43.710 --> 52:47.515
The worms are
shitting in my mouth, daddy.

52:48.616 --> 52:49.618
Help me.

52:50.752 --> 52:56.324
The worms, they're crawling
inside every hole, daddy.

52:56.357 --> 53:00.661
Every... single... hole.

53:02.029 --> 53:03.764
You did this to me.

53:40.735 --> 53:44.172
I am in hell because of you.

53:48.208 --> 53:51.612
God, if you're up there,
don't forget us little people down here.

53:51.645 --> 53:52.645
Please...

53:55.415 --> 53:58.318
I never prayed a day in
my entire life, you know that?

54:00.821 --> 54:01.956
Isn't that something?

54:11.965 --> 54:13.445
Kind of crazy
when you think about it.

54:15.335 --> 54:17.738
More than fifty years of life.

54:17.772 --> 54:19.974
Yeah. Let's see.

54:20.007 --> 54:22.143
That's more than 18,000 days,

54:23.076 --> 54:25.279
that I've never put
my hands together and spoke with

54:25.311 --> 54:27.882
an entity that I believe
held the key to salvation.

54:29.215 --> 54:30.719
I often thought about why.

54:31.953 --> 54:35.357
Well, that's not true, it's
not often, but it's sometimes.

54:37.924 --> 54:40.644
You think if I prayed to god tonight,
this all could've been avoided?

54:44.165 --> 54:47.701
I mean, what about Allah?
I mean, what god does what?

54:47.735 --> 54:49.837
And who does what,
and why and when?

54:49.869 --> 54:51.839
And where,
and it's all bullshit.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.175
Try to wake her up.

54:57.011 --> 54:58.146
Richard.

54:58.179 --> 55:00.947
Two weeks ago, I ordered an item

55:00.980 --> 55:04.951
for my collection for a museum
I foolishly tried to open.

55:04.985 --> 55:08.723
- Ah, the museum of the macabre.
- Melvin.

55:08.755 --> 55:10.958
I don't care. All right?

55:12.058 --> 55:15.129
Richard. I ordered
the remains of a vampire.

55:16.197 --> 55:18.099
A vampire, Richard,
that's what they said.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.436
El demonia de la mascarada.

55:23.770 --> 55:25.239
The demon of the masquerade.

55:26.973 --> 55:28.008
My wife?

55:30.043 --> 55:32.179
I think she removed
that stick from the dress.

55:34.081 --> 55:35.750
And that stick was a stake.

55:38.485 --> 55:40.288
She removed the stake, Richard.

55:41.788 --> 55:43.057
That girl out there?

55:44.058 --> 55:45.293
That's a real vampire.

55:46.192 --> 55:47.696
That's what we're up against.

55:49.797 --> 55:50.965
A vampire?

55:52.967 --> 55:55.036
Yeah. So you'll excuse me,

55:55.069 --> 55:59.306
if I ask you to join me with praying
hands, and on bended knee.

56:07.248 --> 56:10.083
Melvin! Melvin.

56:10.116 --> 56:12.886
Please let me in,
it's freezing outside.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.057
- Melvin!
- That's not your little friend, Melvin.

56:17.090 --> 56:19.293
Melvin, I'm so scared.

56:19.326 --> 56:21.329
He never
called me by my first name.

56:22.263 --> 56:24.531
- Professor g...
- Please, help me.

56:24.565 --> 56:27.902
- That's right.
- I was the only one who believed in you.

56:27.935 --> 56:29.270
Pray with me!

56:29.302 --> 56:31.839
- Melvin, please!
- All right.

56:31.871 --> 56:33.808
All right. Can't hurt.

56:33.840 --> 56:37.011
- I've always loved your museum.
- God.

56:37.043 --> 56:39.379
God, we need you,
we need your help right now.

56:39.413 --> 56:41.458
You know where we are,
you know Danny's hurt out there.

56:41.482 --> 56:43.551
You know where Danny is,
we need you to help him.

56:43.583 --> 56:46.186
- Would you help him?
- I thought you never prayed before.

56:46.219 --> 56:48.156
Please let me in.

56:48.188 --> 56:50.223
I'm not praying with words
from a Bible, Richard,

56:50.257 --> 56:51.826
I'm praying
with words from my heart.

56:53.393 --> 56:55.237
God, you're the only one
that can help us right now,

56:55.261 --> 56:57.364
you know everything
that's going on right now,

56:57.397 --> 56:58.999
only you can help us right now!

56:59.032 --> 57:00.534
All right, my turn.

57:00.567 --> 57:02.336
Might not be as fancy as yours.

57:03.938 --> 57:05.907
I've got
a few things I need to say.

57:07.407 --> 57:08.976
Then by god, say it!

57:11.846 --> 57:13.214
I'm cold.

57:13.246 --> 57:15.949
I'm so fucking cold.

57:15.982 --> 57:19.186
And my sister's neck is open.

57:19.219 --> 57:21.855
It's like she has two holes!

57:21.889 --> 57:24.192
Three when you think about it.

57:24.225 --> 57:26.927
And they all bleed, Melvin.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.529
- They all bleed.
- Richard?

57:28.561 --> 57:30.240
Look, we're not just praying
for your daughter,

57:30.264 --> 57:31.474
we're praying
for that boy out there,

57:31.498 --> 57:33.467
they're both savable!

57:33.500 --> 57:35.936
Richard! You know it's true.

57:35.969 --> 57:38.339
You know what under
the moon means, Richard.

57:38.371 --> 57:42.844
You've already let your daughter burn for
millions of years. Each minute you sit?

57:42.877 --> 57:44.920
- You let her burn!
- Don't listen. Just don't listen.

57:44.944 --> 57:47.547
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No, no! Just stay with me. Stay with me.

57:47.581 --> 57:49.550
Got it! Keep praying!

57:49.583 --> 57:52.186
God, we need you help.
We need your help right now.

57:52.219 --> 57:54.288
- Please don't leave my daughter.
- Oh.

57:54.321 --> 57:56.156
- What?
- Stop, stop, stop.

57:56.190 --> 57:58.393
- I said, come on!
- Stop, it's the lights!

58:00.094 --> 58:03.097
They did that when
masquerade was nearby.

58:27.955 --> 58:31.592
<i>Playing
shitty stepdaughter song.</i>

58:41.335 --> 58:44.138
Richard. Can you let me in?

58:44.170 --> 58:45.605
Please help me.

58:45.639 --> 58:47.475
Mouse and I are under the moon.

58:48.475 --> 58:50.944
I can help you get her back.

58:50.978 --> 58:52.647
And I...

58:52.679 --> 58:54.948
I need someone to get me back.

58:56.150 --> 58:58.252
Vampires cannot come
inside the home

58:58.284 --> 59:00.087
if you do not invite them in!

59:00.119 --> 59:02.522
I got to take that chance!
That's my daughter!

59:02.556 --> 59:05.426
Wait, Richard, you got to listen
to me, you got to listen to me!

59:05.458 --> 59:07.694
They're driven by demon spirits.

59:07.728 --> 59:10.563
Their servants are not,
and despite all the cat calls,

59:10.596 --> 59:13.301
and their taunts,
there's nothing she can do!

59:13.333 --> 59:15.469
It's masquerade
talking through them!

59:15.502 --> 59:17.304
She wants us to open that door,

59:17.337 --> 59:19.040
the longer we stay close to her,

59:19.072 --> 59:20.951
the more we risk looking into
her eyes, Richard.

59:20.975 --> 59:22.509
- We must keep praying!
- Hey, dad!

59:26.346 --> 59:28.315
You did this to me, fucker!

59:29.248 --> 59:35.156
You taped these things to my
hands you stupid son of a bitch!

59:58.244 --> 01:00:00.681
You did to me, daddy.

01:00:00.714 --> 01:00:03.583
You killed your own daughter,
you piece of shit!

01:00:03.616 --> 01:00:07.354
You killed your own daughter,
I hate you!

01:00:17.764 --> 01:00:19.766
Melvin!

01:00:19.799 --> 01:00:21.234
Richard.

01:00:24.071 --> 01:00:25.071
That's Caroline.

01:00:27.141 --> 01:00:28.676
Come with me.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:29.708
No.

01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:39.520
Caroline!

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.659
Caroline! Let me in!

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:46.726
Mouse?

01:00:50.464 --> 01:00:52.766
Kiddo, what... no.

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:04.677
Look at what you did
to me, daddy.

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:07.482
Look at what you did to me!

01:01:16.757 --> 01:01:19.527
No!

01:01:21.328 --> 01:01:22.530
Caroline!

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:27.768
I know I haven't
been perfect, kid.

01:01:29.168 --> 01:01:30.304
Trust me, I know.

01:01:31.871 --> 01:01:33.674
But, I will be better.

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:36.610
We can make it together!

01:01:38.177 --> 01:01:39.346
I'm so sorry...

01:01:42.648 --> 01:01:44.484
<i>Can you hear me Caroline?</i>

01:01:45.384 --> 01:01:48.622
<i>Woah. Yeah. What is this?</i>

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:53.261
<i>This is us talking.
It's pretty cool actually.</i>

01:01:56.897 --> 01:01:59.165
<i>Momma? This is scary.</i>

01:01:59.199 --> 01:02:02.570
<i>Considering how the
evening has been as a whole,</i>

01:02:02.603 --> 01:02:05.706
<i>this can hardly be
considered scary.</i>

01:02:05.739 --> 01:02:08.409
<i>This is just ...Us.</i>

01:02:09.543 --> 01:02:11.145
<i>Daddy...</i>

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:17.717
<i>It's taking everything I have
to tell you to help me.</i>

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:20.855
<i>Let him in.</i>

01:02:20.888 --> 01:02:23.891
<i>It's the only way to save me.</i>

01:02:23.924 --> 01:02:28.728
<i>I was taken under the moon,
saving you.</i>

01:02:28.761 --> 01:02:32.232
<i>Please... save me too.</i>

01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:36.304
<i>Look at your mother, Caroline.</i>

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:02.196
<i>Do you think
anyone will miss me?</i>

01:03:02.929 --> 01:03:06.366
<i>I missed you, Caroline.</i>

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.269
<i>I missed you too, momma.</i>

01:03:22.415 --> 01:03:24.417
<i>That's it, daddy.</i>

01:03:24.451 --> 01:03:26.554
<i>That's it, Richard, that's it.</i>

01:03:26.587 --> 01:03:28.589
<i>That's it.</i>

01:03:29.489 --> 01:03:34.295
<i>I know you're coming to save me.
I'm so happy!</i>

01:03:34.328 --> 01:03:35.730
<i>She's so happy.</i>

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.836
Do you
know how to save my daughter?

01:03:43.302 --> 01:03:44.538
Do you?

01:03:45.806 --> 01:03:48.542
<i>No, no, Richard.</i>

01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:52.679
<i>Your little slut daughter
is going to suffocate</i>

01:03:52.712 --> 01:03:54.981
<i>in the hot coals.</i>

01:03:55.014 --> 01:03:59.886
<i>With worms crawling through
her bleeding eye sockets.</i>

01:04:00.853 --> 01:04:03.723
<i>Screaming for you.</i>

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:07.761
<i>Regretting coming to save you.</i>

01:04:23.777 --> 01:04:25.545
Melvin!

01:04:25.578 --> 01:04:28.415
Melvin!

01:04:31.752 --> 01:04:34.455
Get your ass over here!

01:04:38.391 --> 01:04:40.793
The tape! The tape, where is it!

01:04:40.826 --> 01:04:44.831
- We used it all on me!
- Oh, come on, oh, my god, goddammit!

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:46.532
He's just a boy, use your shirt!

01:04:46.565 --> 01:04:47.876
I don't have a shirt
just laying around!

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.603
Use the shirt you got on!

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.272
I'm not taking my shirt off.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.882
I have fucking issues
with taking my shirt off!

01:04:52.906 --> 01:04:56.509
- For god's sake, be a man!
- Aw, man, fuck you!

01:04:56.543 --> 01:04:59.613
Okay. It's going to be
all right. Danny, I got you.

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.414
- Danny, I got you.
- Move.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.860
You mind telling me
why you had to choke him out?

01:05:04.884 --> 01:05:08.388
Well, he tried to invite
your mail order vampire inside.

01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:12.860
Oh, jee...
Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh...

01:05:12.893 --> 01:05:14.728
Oh, shit.

01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:16.831
Oh, my god. Richard! Look...

01:05:17.730 --> 01:05:20.500
Trying not to think
about that right now, Melvin!

01:05:20.534 --> 01:05:22.311
Richard, you got to listen,
now listen. Listen!

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:24.003
Look, it's the eyes.

01:05:24.036 --> 01:05:26.572
It's the eyes, I think
that's how she gets them!

01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:28.842
She uses them through the eyes.

01:05:49.628 --> 01:05:51.065
They say that the eyes...

01:05:52.799 --> 01:05:54.668
Are the window to the soul.

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:57.905
Yeah...

01:05:57.938 --> 01:05:59.340
I guess that was true.

01:06:00.107 --> 01:06:01.107
What the...

01:06:31.938 --> 01:06:32.938
Oh, shit.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:35.842
Oh, shit, man!

01:06:49.054 --> 01:06:53.025
Praying didn't work at all! All this
time, it was just a bunch of bullshit!

01:06:53.058 --> 01:06:55.661
You're staring at a vampire called
the demon of the masquerade,

01:06:55.694 --> 01:06:58.398
you're doubting there's a god?
You got a cross in this house Melvin,

01:06:58.431 --> 01:06:59.641
because I'm not
doubting for one more minute.

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:01.134
You're talking to an atheist.

01:07:01.168 --> 01:07:02.370
Good point though.

01:07:09.009 --> 01:07:10.711
Shut up!

01:07:30.197 --> 01:07:31.432
Melvin!

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.566
Melvin, you coward!

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:37.470
Dammit, Melvin!

01:07:39.505 --> 01:07:40.774
Mouse!

01:07:43.509 --> 01:07:45.078
Mouse...

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:37.997
Dad...

01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:08.962
Hey!

01:09:12.298 --> 01:09:14.700
Fucking bitch!

01:09:17.270 --> 01:09:20.040
Enjoy your trip to hell...

01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:49.603
Richard!

01:09:49.636 --> 01:09:52.639
Richard! No,
this can't be happening!

01:09:54.038 --> 01:09:56.743
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, god!

01:09:58.178 --> 01:10:00.948
Louisie!

01:10:00.981 --> 01:10:04.017
Louisie! Please.

01:10:04.049 --> 01:10:06.652
Sorry, Melvin,

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:12.593
looks like the end of your
pathetic story is your new friend

01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:15.294
smashing your brains out.

01:10:15.328 --> 01:10:16.563
Shit!

01:10:24.103 --> 01:10:27.106
Hell awaits, you piece of shit!

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:29.241
This is fucked up!

01:10:29.275 --> 01:10:32.312
Your wife
and stepdaughter never loved you.

01:10:32.344 --> 01:10:36.115
No one loved you
your entire life.

01:10:36.148 --> 01:10:37.817
This can't be happening!

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:13.921
Yeah!

01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:23.097
Whoa!

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:25.831
You see that?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.968
She bought it, Melvin!

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.802
She bought it!

01:11:29.835 --> 01:11:32.739
That was fucking awesome!

01:11:32.771 --> 01:11:35.708
Oh, my god, Richard!
You are a genius!

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:38.979
For all that talk
about the worms,

01:11:39.012 --> 01:11:41.348
she sure took one off the hook!

01:11:45.118 --> 01:11:46.285
Yeah, baby!

01:12:44.544 --> 01:12:46.379
Still nothing?

01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:50.182
No, I'm afraid.
Danny's out, he's sleeping.

01:12:50.215 --> 01:12:53.053
His vitals are fine,
he's just... sleeping.

01:12:54.987 --> 01:12:55.987
Hmm.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:01.125
What?

01:13:02.428 --> 01:13:03.428
Eh, nothing.

01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:05.798
Nothing, just...

01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:10.870
Just a story that accompanied
masquerade's coffin about

01:13:10.904 --> 01:13:12.172
sleeping under the...

01:13:14.874 --> 01:13:16.176
It's nothing, nothing.

01:13:28.087 --> 01:13:29.188
Nothing at all, Richard.

01:13:49.875 --> 01:13:51.078
I guess this is it then.

01:13:59.552 --> 01:14:01.021
Where's the bitch?

01:14:04.089 --> 01:14:05.525
You mean masquerade.

01:14:10.062 --> 01:14:11.431
Let's just say safe.

01:14:13.066 --> 01:14:15.068
That is, others are safe.

01:14:16.502 --> 01:14:19.406
Now, I have
her locked away in storage,

01:14:19.438 --> 01:14:23.043
and she's primed to be
the prized piece

01:14:23.075 --> 01:14:25.377
of my museum of the macabre.

01:14:34.486 --> 01:14:36.389
I'm just kidding,
Richard, I'm just kidding.

01:14:39.157 --> 01:14:41.895
She's burning. Burning
right there in the back yard.

01:14:43.329 --> 01:14:46.166
The sun's doing
what it does to vampires.

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:50.169
Uh, you good?

01:14:51.536 --> 01:14:53.072
You got enough for your trip?

01:15:02.048 --> 01:15:03.048
Melvin?

01:15:07.687 --> 01:15:09.589
You ever come
into contact with some

01:15:09.621 --> 01:15:12.058
duffle bags full of money? Hmm?

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:16.396
You ever
move something like that,

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.931
you ever keep
something like that here?

01:15:21.467 --> 01:15:23.503
Anybody ever ask you to do that?

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:30.410
- No.
- Are you sure?

01:15:33.079 --> 01:15:35.382
Yeah. I am.

01:15:38.151 --> 01:15:40.587
They say the eyes are
the windows to the soul.

01:15:47.026 --> 01:15:48.328
Well, that sucks for you.

01:15:49.262 --> 01:15:51.632
Because you only got
half a soul left.

01:15:57.971 --> 01:16:00.307
I only had
half a soul to begin with.

01:16:59.798 --> 01:17:01.033
Speaker.

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:06.438
Play best stepdaughter
song ever.

01:17:06.472 --> 01:17:10.310
<i>Playing
best stepdaughter song ever.</i>
