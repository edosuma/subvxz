it's out there somewhere.

that's really true?

on what your idea
of treasure is.

lf you were to find it,

01:00:10.691 --> 01:00:12.483
what would you do with it?

some of it to my mom.

is pretty leaky,

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:36.382
l'd give it to our town,

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.467

Mr. Bruchschnauser

that makes it look

is true or not,

that is true.

Well, what about
Hollywood?

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.833
l never really liked decaf
soy lattes that much anyway.

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:43.753
l just order them because
everybody else does.
(CHUCKLES)

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:46.630
But listen, if we really
wanna put O'Malley's Cove

01:29:46.715 --> 01:29:48.632
back on its feet again,

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:50.551
we're gonna have
to do something

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.054
to let the whole world
know about this place.

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:55.389
We?

01:29:56.475 --> 01:29:58.142
l wonder how
we're gonna do that.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.940
MAN: Can l get a dolly
over here?

01:30:09.154 --> 01:30:10.196
EDDlE: Okay.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.363
Now remember,

01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:13.741
the bad pirates are trying
to steal the treasure,

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.618
so you need
to protect it. Got it?

01:30:15.994 --> 01:30:17.703
Got it.
EDDlE: Okay, everybody.

01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:20.289
Let's do this.
Let's make a movie.

01:30:20.373 --> 01:30:21.791
Eddie Thornton.

01:30:21.875 --> 01:30:24.919
Charlene, how many times
do l have to tell you,

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:26.754
we're not coming back?

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.257
That's right. Beethoven
and l are making
our own movies now.

01:30:30.342 --> 01:30:32.718
With a little help
from our friends.

01:30:32.803 --> 01:30:37.056
All right, people.
Let's move it.
Places, everybody.

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.141
Pirates, thank you
very much. Okay.

01:30:39.226 --> 01:30:41.602
Let's get our
butts in gear.
Come on !

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:43.354
MAN: Ahoy there, lad.

01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:48.609
Looks good.

come in for a little more.

01:30:48.693 --> 01:30:50.694
And here's your coffee,
Mr. Thornton.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:53.114
Uh, regular,
just the way you like it.

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:57.368
Hmm. Mmm-hmm.

01:30:59.412 --> 01:31:01.038
We're gonna be
in the movies.

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:11.841
Thanks, Grandpa.

01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:14.885
What'd you say, Sam?

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.220
Nothing.

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:20.141
Never mind.

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:21.725
Let's roll it.

01:31:29.568 --> 01:31:31.318
