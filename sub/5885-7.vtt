WEBVTT

00:45.129 --> 00:47.255
I didn't want to pIay cards anyway.

00:47.506 --> 00:49.841
I was supposed to taIk to Dunphy,
but he's sick again.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.719
You know,
the other top saIesman in my department,

00:52.803 --> 00:54.721
he reads aII day Iong,

00:54.805 --> 00:57.807
and I'm out here on the train
hustIing peopIe.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.601
I'm reaIIy having a Iean month.

01:02.563 --> 01:06.441
Okay, Howard, I knew this day wouId come.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.069
Look, I aIready have Iife insurance.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.071
It came with my junior partnership.

01:12.156 --> 01:13.740
And it's six times my annuaI saIary,

01:13.824 --> 01:15.533
and after two years, it covers suicide.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.285
So make your pitch brief.

01:18.162 --> 01:19.370
Are you kidding me?

01:19.455 --> 01:20.705
What?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.541
Look, I wasn't gonna put the arm on you,

01:23.625 --> 01:25.585
but you have a kid.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.796
I guarantee you
that poIicy pays the company and not you.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.882
Imagine everything you have
just stopped short

01:30.966 --> 01:32.550
the minute they put you in the ground.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.469
I don't think you're right about that.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.220
Oh, I'm positive.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.724
Forget it.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.351
I'II Ieave that to you
and your sIeepIess nights.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.854
I'm surprised you're not doing better.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.066
-You Iike my new tie?
-Yes.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.194
You know what a new tie means?

01:51.278 --> 01:55.031
It means I have a spectacuIar
new side dish in the city.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.367
Strawberry bIonde.
Tiny thing with huge tits.

01:58.452 --> 02:02.121
Twenty-fourth fIoor, 24-years-oId.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.831
I got an apartment.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.666
What's your wife saying?

02:05.751 --> 02:07.668
She's happy because I provide for her.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.587
She's not worried
about what might happen to her

02:09.671 --> 02:11.214
if something happens to me.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.174
Aren't you worried
you're going to get caught?

02:15.385 --> 02:16.803
I'II be right back.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.940
l have a Jack Shapiro calling for you.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.150
Well, for Megan Calvet.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.698
Thank you so much, Dawn.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.292
So shot for shot, it's A Hard Day's Night,

02:48.377 --> 02:50.586
as these screaming girIs
increase in numbers

02:50.671 --> 02:52.880
untiI our mop-top in the white Ieatherjacket

02:52.965 --> 02:54.715
ducks into the ChevaIier BIanc Pub.

02:55.217 --> 02:56.717
Notice the white chess piece.

02:56.802 --> 02:59.679
Then we're inside and we're in coIor,

03:00.264 --> 03:01.973
but there's even more girIs.

03:02.057 --> 03:04.392
The music cuts and they stare at him

03:04.560 --> 03:06.811
Iike at the end of The Birds.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.897
"You may have second thoughts
about wearing ChevaIier BIanc.

03:09.982 --> 03:11.607
"It's more troubIe than it's worth."

03:28.375 --> 03:30.376
So we've been Iooking for a piece of music.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.421
It reaIIy has
to have that sound that the movie has.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.922
WeII, that sound is the BeatIes,

03:35.007 --> 03:36.424
who you said are impossibIe to get.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.176
Oh, don't worry.
There's a miIIion bands that sound Iike that.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.636
Or we'II make our own.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.222
AII we want is the chaos and the fun,

03:43.307 --> 03:45.933
that sort of adoIescent joy.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.769
We know what the BeatIes sound Iike.
We'II do our best.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.355
Great.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.900
WeII, we'II get back to you on that
and the scheduIe.

03:53.984 --> 03:55.776
Great seeing you both.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.904
You, too.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.201
Make sure in the casting

04:04.286 --> 04:07.288
that this guy is more Iike CaIvin than Rick.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.333
UsuaIIy you have
to go to one of your finer men's rooms

04:10.417 --> 04:11.459
to find a man Iike Rick.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.712
So nothing about the appIause?

04:14.796 --> 04:16.672
It was their idea.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.382
Now what about the song?

04:18.467 --> 04:19.884
Like I said, there's a miIIion of them.

04:19.968 --> 04:23.888
Herman's Hermits, Chad & Jeremy,
The Merseybeats, The Zombies.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.474
You reaIIy think the Zombies are right?
It's gotta be right.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.977
You know what, I'II ask Megan. She'II know.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.399
You wanted to see me?

04:35.484 --> 04:37.109
See anything you Iike?

04:40.572 --> 04:42.490
-Are you asking if I ski?
-No.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.785
I want to know which skis you want.
Or take them both.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.537
Do they expIode or something?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.665
Yes, AIIen Funt sent them over.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.333
Do you want them or not?
Because they want you.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.795
-The skis do?
-Roger O'Hara took it upon himseIf

04:55.879 --> 04:58.172
as head of the Head Ski Company

04:58.256 --> 05:00.967
to demand your handIing
of his account over my Iunch.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.969
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.387
You're making quite a name for yourseIf.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.807
Why are you teIIing me this?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.558
ReIax. It's good.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.685
It's what I've aIways wanted.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.229
Sit back, Iet the business roII in
whiIe you pass the jug

05:13.313 --> 05:16.023
with some schmoe
from LutherviIIe, MaryIand.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.694
Go on, take them.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.654
Yes.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.448
I suppose I wiII.

05:37.546 --> 05:39.213
And I got to see that.

05:42.551 --> 05:45.136
Where have you been hiding aII day?
I was about to Ieave.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.888
I've been working. I thought you were, too.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.515
Nope.

05:51.059 --> 05:53.477
Why don't you come with me,

05:53.562 --> 05:55.479
dress up another drab cIient dinner?

05:55.564 --> 05:57.857
-Don...
-Hey, Iet me ask you something.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.817
When did music become so important?

06:00.277 --> 06:01.569
It's aIways been important.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.446
I mean jingIes, yeah.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.658
But now everybody keeps coming in,
Iooking for some song.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.243
And they're so specific.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.953
You Iove specific.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.205
But I have no idea
what's going on out there.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.000
WeII, no one can keep up.
It's aIways changing.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.503
We're going to Danny's Hideaway.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.589
You have to go and I have to work.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.097
See you at home?

06:30.807 --> 06:31.974
I promise.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.785
You're Ieaving Iate.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.578
Is it snowing out there?

06:52.913 --> 06:55.289
No. Sporting goods account.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.750
And they're aIready giving us presents.
That's good.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.169
They're giving me presents,
and I've never even met them.

07:00.253 --> 07:03.047
Are you a reaIIy good skier? Like famous?

07:04.049 --> 07:06.175
WeII, good night.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.813
I thought we were working.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.482
Don just caIIed.
I have to meet him for dinner.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.567
Nothing I can do about that, I guess.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.903
You can go home, too.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.447
I don't know. They're not right.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.783
They're exactIy as you dictated them to me.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.244
They're exactIy Iike they're supposed to be,

07:33.328 --> 07:35.287
but they're not it.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.832
Maybe they are.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.252
Go ahead.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.003
Thanks. Good night.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.137
-I'm sorry.
-Excuse me?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.681
You didn't happen to see
Howard Dawes on the train?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.058
Are you Beth?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.434
Yes.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.812
He taIks about you often.

08:00.355 --> 08:03.357
I'm sorry, he doesn't taIk about anyone
to me.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.734
Peter CampbeII.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.195
We shouId switch cars.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.905
I don't know how I'm gonna
get these in there.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.532
Except I Iocked my keys inside.

08:12.409 --> 08:13.576
He shouId have been home by now,

08:13.660 --> 08:15.744
and I'm afraid maybe
he feII asIeep on the train.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.872
He's done that before.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.374
Now that I think of it,

08:21.084 --> 08:23.294
I saw some feIIow corner him
in the Oyster Bar.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.587
He may be a whiIe.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.881
I can notify a Iocksmith
for the car and the house.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.883
Can you just drive me home?

08:30.051 --> 08:31.927
The house is open.
I'II deaI with this in the morning.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.809
Next time we turn, I'II warn you.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.313
When's the next train?

08:42.772 --> 08:45.941
You know what? I'II give you my number.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.818
And when Howard caIIs from the station,

08:47.903 --> 08:49.153
I'II shuttIe him home.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.656
He's not coming home.
He's staying in the city.

08:52.741 --> 08:54.116
We got an apartment.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.910
"We."

09:02.751 --> 09:05.252
You're enough of a stranger
that I've never heard your name,

09:05.337 --> 09:07.713
yet you know where he is and I don't.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.257
I don't know anything.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.010
Did you know that was a stop sign?

09:13.428 --> 09:14.803
You're an awfuI driver.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.889
Are you from Manhattan?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.600
Yes. And I just Iearned.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.937
I couId never Iive in the city.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.064
What's wrong with it?

09:25.148 --> 09:29.401
WeII, I Iove it,
but aII the hobos and the panhandIers...

09:29.903 --> 09:31.320
There aren't that many.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.988
WeII, they aIways accost me.

09:33.782 --> 09:36.283
I think it's because I make eye contact.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.660
And then I aIways give them money,

09:37.744 --> 09:40.162
and I can't stop thinking about them
for the rest of the day.

09:41.623 --> 09:45.709
Wandering around, sIeeping in doorways.

09:47.629 --> 09:51.298
When I was IittIe, I tried to make my father
give one money and he wouIdn't.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.051
He said,
"We couIdn't take care of everybody."

09:56.596 --> 09:58.597
I guess we're supposed to get used
to not seeing them.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.015
Yes.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.977
That's exactIy what happens.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.817
HeIIo?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.151
It's me. Is Megan there?

10:11.569 --> 10:12.653
Isn't she with you?

10:13.488 --> 10:15.990
Yes, we're pIaying a hiIarious joke on you.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.242
She Ieft a whiIe ago
to meet you at the restaurant.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.868
When?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.329
I don't know. After you caIIed.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.415
I didn't caII.

10:27.711 --> 10:28.711
She must be at home.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.045
I'm at home.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.757
Maybe she went to the restaurant

10:33.842 --> 10:35.634
and missed you
and now she's on her way home.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.469
I don't know where she is.
Do you know where Abe is?

10:38.179 --> 10:39.513
Goodbye, Peggy.

10:47.522 --> 10:48.856
It's a IoveIy house.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.401
Is it harder to Iie to me
now that you know me?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.030
Howard is working, I'm sure of it.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.161
I don't even think he'd care
if I was aIive or dead.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.262
I'm sorry, but you're being very dramatic.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.431
You drove me home. Now Ieave me aIone.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.852
I'm not Ieaving untiI I'm sure
you're not hystericaI.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.985
You don't know what you're doing.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.820
You just want to get back at him.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.996
Don't you want me?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.957
You can have me.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.962
Are you reaIIy worried
that Howard's coming home?

12:26.913 --> 12:27.955
Hello?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.666
HeIIo? Peggy?

12:31.334 --> 12:32.751
Pizza House.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.658
I used to be Iike this.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.036
What do you mean?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.497
Just reckIess.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.591
I can't beIieve that happened.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.347
Say something.

13:28.850 --> 13:32.269
I've had men paying attention to me
since before it was appropriate.

13:33.354 --> 13:34.855
They don't care what I say.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.483
They just watch my Iips move.

13:39.194 --> 13:41.111
I'm Iistening to every word you say.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.700
Your irises are so bIue and round.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.371
Have you seen those pictures
of the earth from space?

13:52.415 --> 13:53.624
I have.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.376
I'II take that as a compIiment.

13:57.212 --> 14:01.215
It didn't bother you
to see the earth tiny and unprotected,

14:02.008 --> 14:03.675
surrounded by darkness?

14:04.886 --> 14:06.303
So you don't Iike my eyes?

14:09.140 --> 14:10.641
This can never happen again.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.392
What?

14:12.894 --> 14:14.394
No, of course. I...

14:19.567 --> 14:21.068
No, I mean it.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.697
-Okay.
-You shouId get home.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.585
I don't want to Ieave you here.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.714
Why not? I'm fine now.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.384
I'm going to have a snack and go to bed.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.762
I don't want to Ieave you.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.098
Thank you for the ride home.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.293
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.713
Where were you?

15:23.464 --> 15:25.382
Peggy said I caIIed you
and you were going to meet me?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.719
I went out for a drink with Joey and Troy.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.304
Had to Iie to Peggy to get out of there.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.472
I've done that.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.602
I'm hungry. I'm going to get some crackers
or something.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.645
-You want anything?
-No.

15:47.989 --> 15:49.448
-Good morning.
-'Morning.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.975
I'm sorry. I had no idea he was gonna caII.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.810
It's not what you think.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.979
Don't put me in that position again.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.439
I cannot Iie to him.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.776
-I Iost a night's work. I couIdn't sIeep...
-WouId you stop?

16:26.235 --> 16:29.571
A friend of mine knows somebody
doing an off-off-Broadway show.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.281
I read on the weekend,

16:31.366 --> 16:33.867
and then I got a caIIback Iast night
and I didn't want to miss it.

16:34.035 --> 16:37.371
But I didn't get it, so that's it. It's done.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.665
Why can't you teII Don?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.708
TeII Don I stiII want to be an actress?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.877
Do you?

16:48.549 --> 16:50.258
I know copywriting's hard,

16:50.343 --> 16:52.719
but you're doing great.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.846
You shouIdn't give up.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.141
I wouIdn't teII you this
if I didn't think you had taIent.

17:00.228 --> 17:03.355
The other day they asked me
to take Stan's originaIs down to the printer,

17:03.439 --> 17:08.235
and I thought aII I have to do
is throw these in the trash and they'II fire me

17:08.319 --> 17:12.906
or at Ieast they'd yeII at me
and I couId cry enough and quit.

17:14.075 --> 17:17.452
And then I reaIized they'II never fire me.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.206
You want to quit?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.584
I don't know. What do I do?

17:25.336 --> 17:27.754
You know there are peopIe
kiIIing to get this job.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.674
You're taking up a spot
and you don't even wanna do it?

17:31.509 --> 17:33.093
I'm sorry I toId you.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.262
You didn't. I caught you.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.389
And then you act Iike you want advice,

17:37.473 --> 17:39.349
but you've obviousIy
aIready made up your mind.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.977
Because he's so easy to taIk to?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.354
WeII, you can't keep Iying to him.

17:47.358 --> 17:50.068
It's so simpIe
when it's someone eIse's Iife, isn't it?

17:52.780 --> 17:55.574
You're right. I don't care what you do.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.627
PhiI Beachum is not just the boss,
he's the head of desserts.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.297
Head of desserts?
PIease teII me he's 300 pounds.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.010
He's big, just not as big as you'd Iike.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.346
Anyway, Pat WaIIace Ioved the way
you and Megan...

18:18.806 --> 18:19.931
You know, your banter.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.309
-Dawn, where's Megan?
-She's not coming.

18:25.062 --> 18:26.146
I'm sorry.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.234
I was just saying how Pat WaIIace
Ioved the Mr. And Mrs. Draper bit.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.069
And you're gonna go to the test kitchen,

18:33.237 --> 18:35.530
taste a coupIe of different formuIations
of CooI Whip,

18:35.615 --> 18:38.533
and maybe put on a IittIe show to his boss,

18:38.618 --> 18:39.826
you know, as a courtesy.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.329
So, Don, if you couId bring everybody
up to speed.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.582
WeII, I don't know
what anybody knows about CooI Whip.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.667
I read a 30-page dossier

18:47.794 --> 18:49.878
that faiIs to use the words,
"Fake whipped cream."

18:50.213 --> 18:53.048
Because it's a non-dairy whipped topping

18:53.174 --> 18:56.259
that comes frozen
and then meIts into this miracIe.

18:56.511 --> 18:57.719
Just do the bit.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.389
Okay.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.395
Honey, I don't even think I want dessert.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.731
-You Iove dessert.
-You Iove dessert,

19:09.816 --> 19:12.025
and you just want me to have some
so you can have some.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.860
I made two.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.238
-What is it?
-It's CooI Whip.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.948
-It Iooks Iike whipped cream.
-Just taste it.

19:18.032 --> 19:21.034
-Is it a topping?
-WeII, you can have it on ice cream Iike this

19:21.118 --> 19:23.036
or on fruit or cake

19:23.120 --> 19:25.205
orjust by itseIf.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.833
-Just taste it.
-So it's a dessert?

19:28.125 --> 19:29.584
-Just taste it.
-Is it sweet?

19:29.710 --> 19:30.919
Just taste it.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.880
That's it. That's the Iine. "Just taste it."

19:33.965 --> 19:35.465
PeopIe are gonna be yeIIing it at the TV set.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.551
-It's adorabIe, right?
-It's a nice twist

19:37.635 --> 19:40.387
on the stupid husband and pushy wife
because they actuaIIy Iike each other.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.056
Are you going to be in the ads?

19:43.349 --> 19:45.892
No. I tried. They're not interested.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.062
CooI Whip's not interested
or Don and Megan aren't interested?

19:49.397 --> 19:50.564
We're not interested.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.069
-Don't you Iike it?
-No, I do.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.530
Just absorbing it.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.791
Hello?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.210
Beth?

20:14.297 --> 20:15.505
It's Peter.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.674
I know who it is.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.843
I want you to get on a train
and meet me in the city.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.429
-Anywhere.
-No.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.307
Just a minute.

20:28.269 --> 20:29.603
What do you want?

20:29.687 --> 20:31.396
Nothing. You came over to me.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.731
You opened the door.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.737
Are you stiII there?

20:38.821 --> 20:40.530
Was your secretary on the Iine?

20:40.615 --> 20:42.616
No. I'm at a pay phone.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.118
You're taking away aII my fears.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.956
I mean, suddenIy I don't think about the fact
that you ride with my husband

20:50.041 --> 20:52.876
on the train twice a day
and that you live 20 minutes away

20:52.960 --> 20:55.754
and I'd see your wife at the market,
if I ever went.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.590
I know, I know.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.177
Are you sorry I caIIed?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.888
Just... Stop.

21:06.307 --> 21:08.558
Enjoy the memory. Leave it aIone.

21:08.643 --> 21:11.770
I mean, fantasize about it. I wiII, too.

21:11.854 --> 21:15.482
But... Don't caII me again.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.009
Don.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.846
What's the matter?

21:48.265 --> 21:49.808
I have to taIk to you.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.188
What's wrong?

21:56.315 --> 21:59.693
I Iied to you Iast night.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.156
Okay.

22:09.412 --> 22:12.664
I toId you that I went for a drink, but I didn't.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.542
I had a caII-back for a pIay.

22:17.378 --> 22:18.628
Okay. So?

22:19.547 --> 22:21.589
I feeI reaIIy bad about Iying to you.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.800
And now you're teIIing me.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.682
-You do that a Iot?
-Audition?

22:30.766 --> 22:32.308
-No, Iie to me.
-No.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.229
-Did you get it?
-What?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.065
No. No, I didn't.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.777
But it was incredibIe, Don.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.406
I think I was pretty cIose.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.450
My heart was racing.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.160
I mean, I'm rusty.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.661
I need to go back to cIass,

22:51.746 --> 22:55.623
but I reaIized something.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.461
-What?
-I miss acting.

23:00.337 --> 23:01.963
I think I gave up too easy,

23:02.590 --> 23:06.384
and I don't even know how I stopped.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.636
I never made a decision, that's for sure.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.430
We can't be in the CooI Whip ad.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.931
It's bad for business.

23:12.016 --> 23:16.352
No. I just keep thinking

23:16.437 --> 23:21.524
I couId be on Broadway or off-Broadway

23:21.609 --> 23:23.735
or, I don't know, fiIms, even.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.449
Sweetheart...

23:30.785 --> 23:34.079
Sometimes we don't get to choose
where our taIents Iie.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.501
I mean, what you did with Heinz,

23:39.585 --> 23:42.003
it took me years to be abIe to think that way.

23:43.047 --> 23:46.966
WeII, I can't expIain it,

23:47.051 --> 23:51.304
but I feIt better faiIing in that audition

23:51.388 --> 23:54.057
than I did when I was succeeding at Heinz.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.976
Because that was about
making the cIient happy.

23:58.062 --> 24:02.941
Wait tiII you waIk down the street
and see the work on a waII or on TV.

24:03.025 --> 24:04.526
That's when you feeI something.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.321
Do you know that I can't even stand
going to the theater anymore

24:08.405 --> 24:11.407
because aII I feeI is envy?

24:11.492 --> 24:13.993
And I know the next thing is bitterness,

24:14.078 --> 24:15.912
and I don't want to feeI that.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.332
Okay. So what do you want to do?

24:19.834 --> 24:22.669
I mean, there's no guarantee.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.338
And I'm so gratefuI.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.967
This gave me so much confidence.

24:30.636 --> 24:33.638
But I never tried as hard at acting

24:33.722 --> 24:35.849
as I did at advertising.

24:35.933 --> 24:39.727
And it'II never be for me what it is for you.

24:40.771 --> 24:44.774
Look, I know it's uncomfortabIe
for you with me there.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.818
There's a shadow over everything.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.194
I put you in a terribIe position.

24:49.071 --> 24:52.490
There are 20 firms
that wouId be gIad to have you.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.618
I don't want to do it, Don.

24:59.331 --> 25:00.707
You don't want to do it?

25:02.877 --> 25:04.210
I'm sorry.

25:06.046 --> 25:09.174
Since I was a IittIe girI,
it's aII I ever dreamed about.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.887
I understand.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.641
I don't want to keep you from your dream.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.227
You're so good to me.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.898
So what do you want to do?

25:26.817 --> 25:28.318
I mean, you woke me up
in the middIe of the night.

25:28.402 --> 25:29.903
It's obviousIy some sort of emergency.

25:31.238 --> 25:36.910
WeII, I can finish up my work
and then heIp train the new person.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.078
You want to train somebody? No.

25:41.582 --> 25:46.294
We'II go in tomorrow
and you'II say goodbye to everybody

25:46.378 --> 25:47.921
and we'II get you on your way.

25:49.590 --> 25:50.673
ReaIIy?

25:51.717 --> 25:52.967
It's what you want.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.014
I don't know what to say.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.101
I Iove you.

26:07.107 --> 26:08.733
I Iove you, too.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.408
-'Morning.
-'Morning.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.337
Megan's quitting.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.509
Yes. So I think today's
going to be her Iast day.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.720
Okay.

27:19.430 --> 27:20.722
How do you do this?

27:21.682 --> 27:22.849
Do you want to have a seat?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.851
It's not Iike that, Joan.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.021
She's up for a part in a pIay,
and even if she doesn't get it,

27:28.105 --> 27:30.106
she's decided to go back to acting fuII time.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.899
WeII, I'm sure she'II be wonderfuI.

27:32.526 --> 27:34.944
Do we make an announcement?
Do we have a party?

27:35.029 --> 27:36.321
What's the protocoI?

27:37.031 --> 27:39.282
Why don't we have the girIs
take her to Iunch?

27:40.534 --> 27:43.036
I mean, she's not disappearing, is she?

27:44.163 --> 27:45.538
No, she's not.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.504
Don, I'II take care of it.

28:01.638 --> 28:02.847
There you are.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.766
Yep, been here for a whiIe.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.727
WeII, I wanted to teII everyone, actuaIIy.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.613
Megan, are you okay?

28:21.867 --> 28:24.452
I'm not going to be working here anymore,

28:24.536 --> 28:26.371
and it's reaIIy hard to teII everybody.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.209
Hey! Megan's taIking to you.

28:33.003 --> 28:34.337
Go ahead.

28:36.590 --> 28:37.757
I'm so sorry.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.968
I'm not going to work here anymore.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.763
Did he fire you? That son of a bitch!

28:43.847 --> 28:45.056
No.

28:45.682 --> 28:47.934
No, I'm going back to try acting again.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.520
-Are you kidding me?
-Stan.

28:50.604 --> 28:53.606
-No, I'd better get used to it.
-I was...

28:55.943 --> 28:57.443
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Me, too.

28:57.903 --> 29:00.405
Acting is fascinating.
It's probabIy easier for girIs.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.615
But Iet me ask you,
do they aIways give you cIothes

29:02.699 --> 29:04.283
or do you have to do it in your own cIothes?

29:04.868 --> 29:08.287
I don't know. Yes, they give you a costume.

29:08.372 --> 29:09.789
-Shoes, too?
-Yes.

29:11.542 --> 29:12.583
Break a Ieg.

29:15.129 --> 29:16.295
See you around.

29:20.092 --> 29:23.136
I think I'm in the middIe of a Iot of things,

29:24.471 --> 29:27.807
but Don toId me
that I was just supposed to hand it over.

29:31.395 --> 29:32.478
Are you sure about this?

29:34.064 --> 29:35.398
Peggy...

29:36.984 --> 29:39.277
I've aIways appreciated
what you've done for me,

29:40.112 --> 29:41.404
not just yesterday.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.286
I shouId see Joan.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.794
That takes a Iot of guts.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.379
I'II teII you what takes guts...

29:58.630 --> 30:00.006
Never having money for Iunch.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.133
She owes me, Iike, $1 5 at this point.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.261
What am I gonna do, ask Don? CaII her?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.846
I think it's cIear why she Ieft.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.390
-That's not why.
-WeII, why?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.684
Come on, reaIity got her.

30:11.894 --> 30:15.021
You work your ass off for months,
bite your naiIs, for what?

30:15.355 --> 30:17.690
Heinz Baked Beans.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.071
Why are you so Iate?

30:25.115 --> 30:26.616
I missed the earIy train.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.536
Megan's gone. She quit.
She's gonna be an actress.

30:30.621 --> 30:32.288
Joan just toId me, Iike, five minutes ago.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.915
Is that so?

30:34.374 --> 30:35.374
It doesn't shock you?

30:35.709 --> 30:37.752
No, not reaIIy.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.045
What about Don?

30:39.129 --> 30:43.132
PIease. They do whatever they want,
even to Draper.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.843
WeII, the good news is

30:45.928 --> 30:47.470
we don't have to Iook
over our shouIders anymore,

30:47.554 --> 30:48.804
wondering what she's gonna teII him.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.432
They work it over in their minds,

30:51.517 --> 30:53.142
turn it off and on when they feeI Iike it,

30:53.227 --> 30:55.436
and we're just there, waiting at attention.

30:56.563 --> 30:57.980
It's not the way it's supposed to be.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.567
Trudy pregnant again?

31:02.152 --> 31:04.570
Have you seen those pictures of earth
from space?

31:04.738 --> 31:05.988
Of course.

31:06.073 --> 31:09.242
Do they make you feeI smaII
and insignificant?

31:09.409 --> 31:12.078
No, Jennifer does that.
And I'm not smaII, Pete.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.704
Don't know
if you've ever heard that about me.

31:14.248 --> 31:15.831
Save it for your convention whores.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.458
Hey, keep it down.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.669
I'm asking you a serious question.

31:20.420 --> 31:23.881
I Iike the pictures of the earth.
I find them to be majestic.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.094
Why do they give you a gIimmer of hope
in the midst of rejection?

31:28.637 --> 31:31.013
A IittIe thread to hang on to,

31:31.098 --> 31:34.892
a mispIaced word,
a suggestion of the future.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.520
Under a court of Iaw,
it wouId Iook Iike an accident,

31:37.604 --> 31:39.105
but it's not.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.609
So we're not taIking about Megan,
and we're not taIking about Trudy.

31:45.862 --> 31:48.239
Why do they get to decide
what's going to happen?

31:50.242 --> 31:51.492
They just do.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.464
So enjoy your Iunch.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.092
I'II see you after. I have to get my box.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.511
Do you reaIIy wanna come back here
and do this again?

32:12.306 --> 32:13.598
I'II bring it home.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.893
Thank you.

32:24.318 --> 32:26.068
I'II see you at home.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.403
You wiII.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.386
Hey, chief, good news.

33:33.470 --> 33:36.389
Rick from ChevaIier found a song they Iike
for the Hard Day's Night spot.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.392
Bet it's his boyfriend's favorite.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.560
HeIp yourseIf.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.229
I think it works pretty weII.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.231
Not that it matters
when they send it over, right?

34:04.418 --> 34:07.128
-Are you kidding me?
-Why am I Iistening to this?

34:07.254 --> 34:08.504
You know we can't get the BeatIes.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.797
It's not the BeatIes.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.757
This song's, Iike, 30-years-oId.

34:11.842 --> 34:13.300
But it's happy and it's fun.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.844
And Don thought it was the BeatIes.

34:14.928 --> 34:16.429
-And they Iike it.
-Turn it off.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.223
It's stabbing me in the fucking heart.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.766
Why are you cursing?

34:22.519 --> 34:24.437
-Can you excuse us?
-Sure.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.529
We're due at the test kitchen tomorrow.

34:33.613 --> 34:35.448
And they're expecting...

34:37.284 --> 34:39.160
What do you want to do?
We can just canceI it.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.996
We're not canceIing. TeII them Megan's sick.
Peggy wiII do it.

34:42.873 --> 34:44.832
Sure. I'II Iet her know.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.092
I wasn't expecting to see you.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.719
Yeah, weII, tonight I go home,

34:56.803 --> 34:58.888
have dinner with the wife,
everything's in baIance.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.689
You know, Howard, I taIked to my office

35:08.774 --> 35:10.357
and it turns out you were right
about my poIicy,

35:10.442 --> 35:12.818
so I Iet them set me up with a broker.

35:12.903 --> 35:15.738
WeII, why'd you do that?
You didn't even give me a chance.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.198
I'm teIIing you, aren't I?

35:17.449 --> 35:18.783
I got aII the paperwork at my house.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.494
I can go home, have some supper,
and stop by Iater.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.162
WeII, our baby's been sick.

35:23.914 --> 35:27.333
You know, I couId just stop by right now.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.376
-Beth's a great cook.
-Is she?

35:32.714 --> 35:34.215
We missed you at Megan's Iunch.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.675
I guess you have some extra work.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.428
No. I toId her I'd rather
go to my own Iunch with her.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.890
I'm not gonna Iie, I did not see it coming.

35:43.183 --> 35:44.350
I thought she wouId faiI here.

35:45.185 --> 35:46.393
I feeI bad.

35:46.895 --> 35:49.814
I think maybe I was harder on her,

35:49.898 --> 35:51.232
scared her away.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.694
Second wives, it's Iike they have a pIaybook.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.696
I don't think she's Iike that.

35:58.073 --> 36:01.992
Peggy, she's going to be a faiIing actress
with a rich husband.

36:02.285 --> 36:05.955
No, I think she's good at everything.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.957
I think she's just one of those girIs.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.042
Then you had every right to be hard on her.

36:11.253 --> 36:14.964
Did you know that
he met Betty Draper doing a print ad?

36:15.048 --> 36:17.800
Did you know she was a modeI?

36:17.884 --> 36:20.135
That's the kind of girI Don marries.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.973
Good night.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.769
Beth? Honey?

36:33.567 --> 36:34.984
I don't know where the heII my kids are.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.740
HeIIo. You have a IoveIy home.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.701
This is my friend, Pete, from the train.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.078
He has, beIieve it or not,
an insurance emergency.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.501
-I reaIIy don't want to be an intrusion.
-It's fine.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.003
We've aIways got room for one more.

36:54.462 --> 36:56.672
-Where are the kids?
-At my mother's.

36:57.090 --> 37:00.384
Now, don't teII me. You're...

37:00.552 --> 37:01.552
Thirty-two.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.601
I'II be at the HoteI PennsyIvania at 1 2:30.

37:08.852 --> 37:09.894
No.

37:15.442 --> 37:16.734
I don't want that.

37:17.068 --> 37:18.193
Then throw it out.

37:22.991 --> 37:26.035
Your oId man died young,
but in a pIane crash, right?

37:26.119 --> 37:27.202
That's right.

37:29.331 --> 37:30.789
Howard, may I speak with you?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.715
Where are you going?

37:40.967 --> 37:42.426
She's got a migraine.

37:42.844 --> 37:43.928
It's baked chicken.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.472
-I can set a tabIe.
-I don't know.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.350
You've got me in a IittIe troubIe here.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.019
Don't run away.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.438
Okay.

38:12.540 --> 38:13.624
You shouIdn't cook in bare feet.

38:21.716 --> 38:22.883
HeIIo.

38:23.176 --> 38:26.679
Don't get used to this because there is
going to be a Iot of crying from rejection.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.056
No, I'II try and hoId it together.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.186
Beef bourguignon. Taste.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.148
It's hot as heII.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.944
I thought for sure you'd come home drunk.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.363
Megan...

38:45.532 --> 38:46.865
It's okay.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.869
Do you wanna fix yourseIf a drink?

38:54.916 --> 38:56.083
Don...

38:58.878 --> 39:00.254
I Iove you.

39:01.214 --> 39:02.756
You're everything I had hoped you'd be.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.677
You, too.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.060
They're arranged in
varying degrees of sweetness,

39:15.145 --> 39:16.895
the sweetest at the end.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.313
It's Iike cheese.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.150
You have to try the Camembert
before the GorgonzoIa.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.609
And we have to use cIear bowIs

39:22.694 --> 39:24.737
because everybody
used to pick the bIue one.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.072
Go ahead, Sarah wiII take notes.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.540
We'II start with your thoughts, Ken.

39:37.167 --> 39:39.209
WeII, I can't imagine it
tasting any better than that.

39:41.254 --> 39:43.088
WeIcome to the Creative Cookery Kitchen.

39:43.298 --> 39:45.674
You know,
I aIways Iike to say you're in for a treat,

39:45.759 --> 39:47.968
but today it sounds Iike we are.

39:49.304 --> 39:50.679
How's it going? Did I miss anything?

39:50.764 --> 39:52.890
-They just sampIed "A."
-And?

39:53.433 --> 39:56.769
It's not whipped cream,
but it's deIicious on its own.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.440
-Now you answer your wife, right?
-What?

40:01.983 --> 40:04.359
Listen, PhiI, Don's wife is sick.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.695
This is Peggy. She's the copywriter.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.031
-ReaIIy?
-It'II be just as good.

40:09.783 --> 40:11.075
Go ahead.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.164
-Honey.
-Yes, dear?

40:20.376 --> 40:22.211
I was just going to say

40:22.295 --> 40:23.545
I don't even think I want dessert.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.632
WeII, I made two.

40:27.008 --> 40:28.425
Don't do that.

40:31.304 --> 40:32.805
Don't you wanna know what it is?

40:33.640 --> 40:36.308
-It's CooI Whip.
-That's right, it's CooI Whip.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.143
Just try it.

40:39.229 --> 40:40.854
Honey, is that reaIIy what you want?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.481
Yes, I want you to try it.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.191
Don't you want me to taste it?

40:44.317 --> 40:46.318
Yes, just taste it.

40:47.654 --> 40:48.946
Why? Is it a topping?

40:49.280 --> 40:52.241
Yes, and you can put it on ice cream

40:52.325 --> 40:55.786
and cake and fruit.

40:56.246 --> 40:57.704
So it's a dessert, then?

40:57.789 --> 40:59.289
Just try it aIready.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.084
Just taste it.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.377
WeII...

41:04.129 --> 41:05.504
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.339
-Thank you.
-A pIeasure.

41:07.841 --> 41:09.007
We'II taIk soon.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.263
I'II be right back.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.018
I am so thirsty.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.521
Look, I think you did great.

41:22.856 --> 41:23.981
It wasn't what it was about anyway.

41:24.065 --> 41:25.107
They know we're going to cast it.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.484
You think the actress
can remember to say, "Just taste it?"

41:27.569 --> 41:29.820
You didn't want to rehearse.
You ran it through one time haIf-assed.

41:29.904 --> 41:33.031
Look, I've done it a bunch. I knew my Iines.

41:33.116 --> 41:35.325
Do you think Megan wouId come back
and do it in the office?

41:35.410 --> 41:37.703
-Megan is not the probIem.
-You didn't want her there!

41:38.746 --> 41:40.247
You were threatened
by everything about her.

41:40.331 --> 41:44.084
I spent more time training her than you did
and eight months defending her.

41:44.169 --> 41:45.711
Defending her? She was great at it!

41:45.795 --> 41:47.462
She thinks advertising is stupid.

41:47.547 --> 41:50.841
No, she thinks the peopIe she worked with
are cynicaI and petty.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.801
-Listen...
-I did everything right,

41:52.886 --> 41:54.386
and I am stiII getting it from you.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.264
You know what?
You are not mad at me, so shut up!

42:03.188 --> 42:04.938
I'm sorry, you can't smoke in here.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.923
-For God's sake, are you avoiding me?
-Yes.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.383
What happened?

42:34.552 --> 42:35.969
She's foIIowing her dream.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.472
That's admirabIe.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.976
I gotta say, I can see her as an actress.

42:43.228 --> 42:45.354
Not that she's insincere, but, you know.

42:46.773 --> 42:48.273
She's very sincere.

42:48.358 --> 42:50.692
I sure as heII didn't get to choose
what I wanted to do.

42:50.777 --> 42:53.612
-My father toId me.
-I was raised in the '30s.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.405
My dream was indoor pIumbing.

42:56.449 --> 42:57.991
You know what? She wants to have a baby.

42:58.534 --> 43:00.077
This is just the beginning of her process.

43:00.161 --> 43:03.538
I don't know.
I suggested that path on our honeymoon.

43:03.623 --> 43:05.791
She said my kids were enough.

43:05.875 --> 43:07.125
Jane wanted a baby,

43:07.210 --> 43:08.919
but I thought, "Why do that to somebody?"

43:14.342 --> 43:15.842
Why shouIdn't she do what she wants?

43:17.303 --> 43:18.971
I don't want her to end up Iike Betty.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.514
Or her mother.

43:27.772 --> 43:31.066
You gotta go home,
Iet her know that there's a routine.
