00:48.440 --> 00:50.960
Hello, Pa.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.360
-See you soon, Mr. Benjamin.
-Thank you, Kitty.

00:54.360 --> 00:56.320
I've got Harris's list.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.080
Give it back!

01:05.680 --> 01:07.040
Give it back!

01:07.040 --> 01:10.760
You shouldn't be reading
that, you virgin.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.840
Give it back, stop!

01:15.840 --> 01:18.200
Let's see what's in
here about you girls.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.760
Here's yours, Fanny.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.120
"Miss Fanny Lambert.

01:21.120 --> 01:22.760
The very thing in winter
for those who love

01:22.760 --> 01:24.280
a fat, jolly girl,

01:24.280 --> 01:26.840
a fine, bouncing
crummy wench,

01:26.840 --> 01:30.760
and not amiss in summer,
barring perspiration."

01:30.760 --> 01:32.480
Does it say I stink?

01:32.480 --> 01:34.280
Perspire doesn't mean stink.

01:34.280 --> 01:36.200
Yeah, it does.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.840
Here's Kitty's.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.480
I've read mine already.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.840
I'm appealing.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.760
Appalling--read mine.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.480
No, Emily, wait your turn.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.840
"Betsey Fletcher,
Russell Street.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.480
This girl is new
upon the town,

01:48.480 --> 01:51.200
having been debauched
not six months ago."

01:53.320 --> 01:55.280
She's one of Nancy's girls.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.200
What's in there for Nancy?

01:58.480 --> 02:01.200
Fanny, Kitty,
you're both wanted.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.120
Culls are waiting.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.280
"Nancy Birch, Russell Street."

02:08.120 --> 02:11.080
"When flagellation
is required,

02:11.080 --> 02:13.840
she acquits herself to
the entire satisfaction

02:13.840 --> 02:16.720
of her cull."

02:16.720 --> 02:18.440
Read your sister's.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.360
"Miss Charlotte Wells."

02:22.800 --> 02:25.000
"Her extravagance would
scatter the fortune

02:25.000 --> 02:27.520
of any but the most
ambitious keeper.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.560
But her eyes dart delight.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.880
Her bosom enchants to rapture,

02:32.880 --> 02:36.960
and her wit makes her
the very meteor of the hour."

02:36.960 --> 02:38.280
I'll be in there next year.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.680
I doubt it.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.800
You ma keeps you
cosseted up like a baby.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.440
She's waiting for
the right cull.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.120
Better get a move on.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.360
-You're losing your shine.
-What, like you have?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.840
Read mine.

02:48.840 --> 02:50.680
"Miss Emily Lacey.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.440
A wretched piece,

02:52.440 --> 02:55.600
nasty, disagreeable,

02:55.600 --> 02:57.720
snuffy letch

02:57.720 --> 02:59.600
without even
one good quality."

02:59.600 --> 03:02.280
It doesn't say that.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.880
"Walks like a parrot..."

03:06.160 --> 03:10.120
"...and swears like
a drunken drab."

03:10.120 --> 03:12.680
When the time comes,
I hope your quim splits.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.160
Emily Lacey!

03:16.720 --> 03:18.400
All of you.

03:20.840 --> 03:22.880
I've got an officer out there
with such hard prickstand

03:22.880 --> 03:24.400
he can hardly walk.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.000
Mr. Gibbon's arrived to ponder
the riddle of the female,

03:26.000 --> 03:27.160
and you're all
sitting in here

03:27.160 --> 03:30.240
on your goods
like pecking hens.

03:30.240 --> 03:33.120
Take me to the
circle of bliss!

03:33.120 --> 03:36.840
Emily, go and service
Mr. Holland before he expires.

03:36.840 --> 03:38.120
Eat fast.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.520
Scrub up.

03:42.360 --> 03:45.600
Stop vexing my best girl.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.840
I need you to play.

03:55.440 --> 03:59.120
She's as pure as the
snow on St. Paul's.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.680
What's your price,
so I may have her?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.840
You're a valued
patron, Mr. Gibbon,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.120
so you'll pardon my candor

04:07.120 --> 04:08.600
when I tell you you'll
mount that harpsichord

04:08.600 --> 04:09.840
before you have my daughter.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.120
Clawing your way up
in the world?

04:12.120 --> 04:14.160
I'm soon taking
a fine new house,

04:14.160 --> 04:15.600
in Soho.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.120
Greek Street.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.920
When we're settled there,

04:19.920 --> 04:23.120
I'll be taking sealed bids
for Lucy's virginity.

04:23.120 --> 04:26.360
Twenty-five pounds
to have her now.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.040
Sealed bids.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.160
As I did for Charlotte,
my older daughter.

04:31.160 --> 04:35.680
She is one of the brightest
stars in London's firmament.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.240
And I intend no less for Lucy.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.120
Miss Lambert, at last.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.720
Fanny, the Lieutenant
would cherish a voyage

04:44.720 --> 04:46.040
on your peaks.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.480
At your service.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.360
I'll give you thirty
pounds to have her,

04:49.360 --> 04:50.600
now on that stool.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.720
That's out of the question.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.560
-Forty.
-I know her value.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.240
Fifty.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.160
Fifty pounds.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.600
Lucy?

05:05.720 --> 05:08.480
What is keeping Miss Carter?

05:14.040 --> 05:18.800
What a hell-bound
spider you are.

05:18.800 --> 05:21.920
I'm clawing my way upwards
in the world, Mr. Gibbon,

05:21.920 --> 05:23.680
not down.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.680
"At Lydia Quigley's
house of earthly delights,

05:31.680 --> 05:34.240
Michelangelo himself
could not do justice

05:34.240 --> 05:37.240
to the perfect alabaster
of Miss Pettifer's bosom."

05:37.240 --> 05:38.480
The musk, madame.

05:38.480 --> 05:41.360
That's most gratifying.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.560
I'm sure I don't deserve it.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.680
The French Piece.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.040
Read hers.

05:49.040 --> 05:52.360
"Miss D'Aubigne,
Golden Square, Soho."

05:55.920 --> 06:01.560
It says here you're
dead behind the eyes!

06:01.560 --> 06:03.600
Charles?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.920
Morte derriÃ¨re les yeux.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.600
I want eager zeal, comprends?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.040
Or you'll go to the
pimps of Cheapside

06:11.040 --> 06:12.120
and you won't be smiling then!

06:18.800 --> 06:20.120
She says that
from now on,

06:20.120 --> 06:23.120
she'll be the
very spirit of joy.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.920
We're rehearsing
a tableau, Mama.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.160
Diana, bathing with
her nymphs; look.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.920
The Duke of Cumberland
is bringing his retinue

06:31.920 --> 06:33.160
after the play.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.360
Make sure he gets
anything he wants.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.560
Where are you going?

06:37.560 --> 06:40.800
To watch the sport
in Covent Garden.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.360
"This radiant, young
votary of Venus

07:28.360 --> 07:31.160
possesses between
her lithesome legs

07:31.160 --> 07:34.480
a gateway to the
temple of bliss..."

07:34.480 --> 07:37.040
That's me.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.240
I'm bliss, I'm radiant...

08:00.000 --> 08:04.480
I'm sunk in lust and lechery.

08:04.480 --> 08:07.480
What is the cost to my soul?

08:07.480 --> 08:09.160
Five shillings.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.160
Go home to your wife, Ned.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.840
Cleanse these streets

08:19.840 --> 08:23.160
with the fire and
purity in our hearts!

08:23.160 --> 08:28.000
The fornicators, the adulterers,
the abusers of themselves,

08:28.000 --> 08:32.120
the child-stealers, and all
the abominations of Sodom...

08:32.120 --> 08:35.600
They have taken our
great city and sunk it

08:35.600 --> 08:38.240
in the vilest sin.

08:49.840 --> 08:53.320
God lights His
righteous fire tonight.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.480
The burning of the harlots!

08:55.480 --> 08:57.320
Burning!

08:57.320 --> 08:59.080
Margaret!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.640
They're coming for us!

09:04.200 --> 09:05.840
We will cleanse these streets

09:05.840 --> 09:07.880
with a fire of purity.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.720
It is God's work
we do tonight.

09:10.720 --> 09:13.760
Let us pray that
we do it well.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.640
They've never touched us,
all the years we've been here.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.320
I'll hold them off.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.600
Open the door
in the name of the king!

09:27.600 --> 09:29.360
Wait a while!

09:29.360 --> 09:32.640
Why wake Christian people
in the middle of the night?

09:36.840 --> 09:40.120
Feel God's righteous fire!

09:40.120 --> 09:41.840
Burn, harlots!

09:41.840 --> 09:44.240
Burn, you sinners!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.240
Will you walk with me?

09:48.240 --> 09:50.120
If we seem a couple,
they might not arrest me.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.360
I'm sorry.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.320
Please, Mr. Oswald!

10:12.720 --> 10:14.360
Jacob, son.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.240
Up to the attic and hide.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.600
Open the door!

10:19.600 --> 10:22.720
It pains me to tell you
that the constables have come.

10:22.720 --> 10:25.200
I haven't finished
yet--curse you!

10:27.360 --> 10:29.480
I need to get you out.

10:29.480 --> 10:31.240
What is it, what is it,
what do we do?

10:31.240 --> 10:33.360
Go out the back,
Lieutenant.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.240
Get these on.

10:35.240 --> 10:37.120
Who dares interfere with
an Englishman's right

10:37.120 --> 10:38.120
to go whoring?

10:38.120 --> 10:39.840
Mr. Holland,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.000
set yourself straight!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.360
Think of the safety
of these girls!

10:42.360 --> 10:43.600
We should run, let's run!

10:43.600 --> 10:46.000
No--if you run,
you'll be rape-fodder!

10:48.640 --> 10:50.000
Go to Charlotte

10:50.000 --> 10:51.720
and tell her
what's happening.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.320
Get yourself straight, girls.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.880
Open the door!

10:56.880 --> 10:58.960
Open the door.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.640
Margaret Wells,
I am charging you

11:06.640 --> 11:09.720
under the Disorderly
Houses Act of 1752,

11:09.720 --> 11:12.720
that you do keep an
obscene and bawdy house--

11:12.720 --> 11:16.360
You lie, and your warrant
is a trumped-up sham!

11:16.360 --> 11:19.840
Get your hands off my tenants!

13:06.360 --> 13:08.200
Charlotte...

13:09.760 --> 13:11.440
Howard!

13:11.440 --> 13:14.840
I've ridden hard
to be with you.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.840
Now you must ride harder.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.320
How I have pined for you.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.440
Night after night,
all alone!

13:23.440 --> 13:25.320
Have you signed the contract?

13:25.320 --> 13:26.520
Are you mine?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.600
I want to be your
lord and master.

13:29.600 --> 13:33.480
Surely you don't want
to talk about that now?

14:04.880 --> 14:06.360
What's in the box?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.120
It's a gift isn't it?

14:08.120 --> 14:09.720
Wait.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.840
You are the pineapple
of Great Britain.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.360
Most lovers would bring pearls.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.240
I cut it from our hothouse.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.960
And as I did so,
I thought of Eve.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.320
She came to my mind
in your form.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.120
Naked, she was tempted
by such a fruit,

14:39.120 --> 14:41.480
tempted to know sin...

14:44.080 --> 14:48.640
So if I am Eve,
then you are?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.200
The serpent!

14:53.480 --> 14:55.520
A person is here
for Miss Wells.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.080
Her sister.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.120
Lucy?

15:03.240 --> 15:04.480
Curse you, Haxby!

15:04.480 --> 15:06.240
Why didn't you
damn well wait?

15:20.600 --> 15:21.720
It's Ma.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.880
I pay my taxes
and my levies.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.600
I support the night watch.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
I donate to the
parish for the poor;

15:35.600 --> 15:37.520
I keep my house in
excellent repair--

15:37.520 --> 15:39.720
The warrant is
signed by a witness

15:39.720 --> 15:42.720
who declares that he paid
you for intimate congress

15:42.720 --> 15:44.600
with the women
who abide with you.

15:44.600 --> 15:45.880
What witness?

15:45.880 --> 15:48.200
The court is not
obliged to name him.

15:48.200 --> 15:49.760
I take money for
furnished rooms.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.240
These girls are my tenants.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.120
There's nothing
illegal in rent.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.000
Your business is
procuring harlots.

15:56.000 --> 16:00.120
Nothing would distress this
dissolute and shameless whore!

16:00.120 --> 16:01.720
Order!

16:01.720 --> 16:04.320
Let not her tongue sway you,

16:04.320 --> 16:06.120
for this harlot has slithered

16:06.120 --> 16:09.880
from her mother's womb
to lure mankind to vice.

16:09.880 --> 16:11.360
No, Sir!

16:11.360 --> 16:13.840
I am Charlotte Wells and I am
here to speak for my mother.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.320
Sit down, Charlotte!

16:15.320 --> 16:18.120
The warrant must be faulty
and the witness false.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.240
He can only have been paid
to smear my mother's name.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.720
How dare you
interrupt this court.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.080
We are pursued and
harried like prey!

16:25.080 --> 16:28.520
My mother protects her girls
because the law does not!

16:28.520 --> 16:30.360
Charlotte, sit down!

16:30.360 --> 16:34.600
These she-hounds are
a cancer in our city

16:34.600 --> 16:36.200
and must be cut out!

16:36.200 --> 16:37.080
Margaret Wells
should be commended

16:37.080 --> 16:39.120
for the way she runs her house,

16:39.120 --> 16:42.480
She is the exemplar of
all the bawds in London!

16:42.480 --> 16:44.520
In your own words,
you have admitted

16:44.520 --> 16:47.720
that your mother
is a common bawd.

16:50.520 --> 16:54.360
I grieve for the desperate
women I have seen today,

16:54.360 --> 16:58.240
who, faced with starvation,
have sold their flesh.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.720
But you are no such
creature, Margaret Wells.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.440
You are a leech

17:03.440 --> 17:05.200
grown fat upon
the sins of others.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.480
Not true!

17:06.480 --> 17:09.880
A vile parasite engaged
in a brutal trade.

17:11.720 --> 17:15.240
I fine you 100 pounds for
running a disorderly house,

17:15.240 --> 17:16.880
and if I see you
before me again,

17:16.880 --> 17:18.520
I'll have you whipped
and transported.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.920
-Empty the court!
-That's justice?

17:20.920 --> 17:22.680
It's not enough!

17:22.680 --> 17:24.320
That is not enough!

17:24.320 --> 17:26.640
-That is not enough--
-You shut your mouth!

17:26.640 --> 17:27.560
Egregious shame!

17:29.480 --> 17:31.440
Florence Scanwell,
that blind bitch.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.480
Someone had to shut her up.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.520
You have imperiled
my move to Greek Street!

17:36.520 --> 17:39.320
My final payment
was due today,

17:39.320 --> 17:41.000
how am I going to
I afford it now?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.080
I'll help you.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.040
Most certainly;
a hundred pounds!

17:44.040 --> 17:45.560
I have some pressing
gaming debts.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.200
But once they're clear...

17:47.200 --> 17:48.640
You're contracted
to a baronet.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.400
He should be paying your debts!

17:51.400 --> 17:53.240
Ma, I haven't signed.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.920
How can I relinquish
my freedom to a man

17:54.920 --> 17:56.680
who thinks I'm a pineapple?

17:58.680 --> 18:01.480
Damn you for a stupid slut.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.280
You need to be his property.

18:03.280 --> 18:06.080
Men don't respect whores;
they respect property.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.920
That's for what you made me.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.320
Got excellent news,
august and venerable madam.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.000
The Wells woman.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.280
Bloody Margaret Wells,
leaving us to walk home.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.000
Why couldn't she get
us sedan chairs?

18:39.000 --> 18:40.800
They took all her money.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.200
She's as tight
as a nun's nip.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.920
Why are you moaning?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.280
She loves you.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.960
She loves my profit.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.080
She loves my pert heavers.

18:50.080 --> 18:53.280
She'll have them worn
to sagging, and for what?

18:53.280 --> 18:57.760
Enough of your spite
and lamenting.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.200
You're like a stinging fly!

19:07.480 --> 19:09.640
My cunny puts
food on his table.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.160
I'm sick of Covent Garden;

19:11.160 --> 19:13.880
sick of Margaret Wells
and her twofaced clucking!

19:13.880 --> 19:15.160
Sweet Emily.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.640
Why don't you just cluck off?

19:41.280 --> 19:44.480
Our new home, if I
can still pay for it.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.720
That money-grabbing landlord.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.280
What a weasel.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.080
He's given me till Monday,
but he's hiked the rent.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.000
Ma, there's your solution.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.240
Sell her virginity.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.320
I'm keeping you intact
till we move in.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.040
Why, when it's coming anyway?

19:57.040 --> 19:58.480
You'll get a finer class.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.640
You may leap up
to where Charlotte is

19:59.640 --> 20:00.720
in one great step.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.640
You had me out at twelve.

20:02.640 --> 20:05.000
Do not think I balk at it.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.920
If you want to keep her
immaculate, fine.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.160
Let her marry a shopkeeper.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.000
And see a man own
everything she earns?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I wouldn't wish
marriage on a dog.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.080
I'm worth at least
fifty pounds, Ma.

20:26.280 --> 20:29.080
They can view you
tonight at the playhouse.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.920
And I'll take sealed bids.

20:35.760 --> 20:39.320
You'll be a Wells woman,
through and through.

20:55.720 --> 21:00.680
I believe in your crusade
against the daughters of vice.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.480
It is not my intention
to charge you any rent.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.880
I am a plain speaker,
Mrs. Quigley.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.240
I am not ignorant of
your name or your house.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.000
You suckle and nurture
an evil trade in flesh.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.640
Why offer me this?

21:19.440 --> 21:23.040
You currently live in a hovel.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.640
You cannot see your child

21:24.640 --> 21:29.240
but she is stooped and thin
with the pallor of a ghost.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.680
What do you want?

21:31.680 --> 21:33.720
I want you to
impale Margaret Wells

21:33.720 --> 21:35.800
on the spear of your campaign.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.480
There are viler bawds than she.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.160
I am fit and well
and my cheeks are rosy.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.000
I'd like to see
Margaret Wells publicly flayed

21:44.000 --> 21:49.480
until her back resembles
a latticed tart.

21:49.480 --> 21:53.240
Would you not
enjoy that too?

21:53.240 --> 21:55.080
Make an example of her.

22:06.800 --> 22:10.960
I worship you, George Howard.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.200
Enter.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.320
I've prepared a fresh copy
of the contracts, my lord.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.240
You'll be responsible
for her debts

22:22.240 --> 22:24.520
as well as her upkeep.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.640
I must advise you,
it will drain your funds.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.520
I want sole ownership now!

22:30.520 --> 22:33.440
I want Charlotte Wells
contracted as mine!

22:36.000 --> 22:40.720
"A busy week for toast
of the town Miss C. W.,

22:40.720 --> 22:46.240
lately in the keeping of
young Baronet Hardhead."

22:46.240 --> 22:49.080
"She was blazing a trail
at the boxing on Tuesday.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.440
At the Masquerade
on Wednesday..."

22:50.440 --> 22:55.080
She said she'd been
living like a nun!

22:55.080 --> 22:57.400
She was out every night!

22:59.480 --> 23:01.240
You knew.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.720
Why didn't you
damn well tell me?

23:07.800 --> 23:12.280
Come in for a
nip of gin, Mags.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.680
Florence Scanwell, Nancy.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.520
What do we know about her?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.760
They say that on
her wedding night,

23:17.760 --> 23:19.160
she saw her husband's
prick and thought it

23:19.160 --> 23:20.320
such a fiendish thing,

23:20.320 --> 23:23.760
she stabbed her own eyes
out with a brooch.

23:28.960 --> 23:31.480
These boys come to pay my rent.

23:33.720 --> 23:37.200
Strange about the
timing though, isn't it?

23:37.200 --> 23:39.400
Just when you're set
to move up in the world,

23:39.400 --> 23:41.000
you get raided.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.520
Who wants me, Nance?

23:44.520 --> 23:46.320
Who have you offended?

23:49.240 --> 23:52.000
Whose name is on my warrant?

25:02.000 --> 25:05.160
Look what came
to the door, Ma.

25:05.160 --> 25:06.720
I would have sent
it away, but it has

25:06.720 --> 25:10.040
some rather unusual curves.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.800
It's looking for a position.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.640
I'm never stuck
for a position, sir.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.320
It's got a spark.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.480
I've been told Mrs. Quigley's
is the outstanding house.

25:20.480 --> 25:24.040
This is my entry
in Harris's List.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.640
I have the gateway
to the temple of bliss.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.880
Have you been long on the town?

25:30.880 --> 25:32.040
I've got good experience.

25:32.040 --> 25:33.520
I'm the best girl
in my current house.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.720
-Any children?
-None living.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.080
What do you know
of art and culture

25:40.080 --> 25:43.880
and the current subjects
of conversation?

25:43.880 --> 25:46.560
I can talk if they want.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.200
What instruments do you play?

25:48.200 --> 25:50.000
The male instrument.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.940
In other words, you're nothing
more than a rutting post.

26:00.313 --> 26:04.520
Every one of my girls
moves, eats, speaks,

26:04.520 --> 26:08.920
sings, and plays like a lady.

26:08.920 --> 26:11.800
The only way she differs
is in her worship of Venus.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.200
I earn a fortune
for my current house.

26:14.200 --> 26:17.720
You're nothing but a
bare-forked animal, my dear.

26:17.720 --> 26:21.160
Shakespeare--and my girls
would know that.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.240
Take her out.

26:23.240 --> 26:24.720
I am constantly asked for.

26:24.720 --> 26:28.000
Mrs. Wells has me on my back
morning, noon, and night

26:28.000 --> 26:30.800
and I know I can do better.

26:30.800 --> 26:34.160
Presumably Wells owns
the dress you're standing in.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.880
What's your debt to her?

26:35.880 --> 26:37.320
Don't know, maybe five pounds?

26:37.320 --> 26:41.240
As an act of benevolence,
I'll settle it.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.720
Then your debt
becomes payable to me.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.800
So you will take me?

26:48.240 --> 26:51.160
I'll have to refine you and
dress you in a proper style.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.240
These costs will be
added to your debt.

26:53.240 --> 26:54.480
So you'll work like a black.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.520
Do you understand?

27:04.440 --> 27:07.880
You can't lock me in!

27:07.880 --> 27:09.640
Let me out!

27:13.720 --> 27:15.640
You are cutting out my heart,

27:15.640 --> 27:17.160
you treacherous whore.

27:17.160 --> 27:19.760
Howard!

27:19.760 --> 27:21.000
Pining alone.

27:21.000 --> 27:22.640
Living like a nun.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.200
Well, don't you dare come
to the playhouse tonight,

27:24.200 --> 27:27.920
you cheating, ly--
you don't deserve to live!

27:41.960 --> 27:46.440
Mumma's ordered me
to try the goods.

27:46.440 --> 27:48.000
You let me out,

27:48.000 --> 27:50.680
or I'll tell every cull
I'm a prisoner here.

27:50.680 --> 27:52.760
You'll be hanged for
a kidnapping pimp,

27:52.760 --> 27:55.880
and so will Mrs. Quigley.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.400
Then go.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.480
As soon as your debt is paid.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.440
What's your name?

28:12.440 --> 28:14.200
Emily Lacey.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.680
Miss Lacey.

28:16.680 --> 28:18.080
I bet you made that up.

28:18.080 --> 28:21.000
What's your real name,
Sally Piddle?

28:23.720 --> 28:27.520
I'm the Duchess of Quim.

28:27.520 --> 28:32.320
I'll wager you're a wild
bouncing kind of a ride.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.920
We'll teach you all the
refinements you'll need--

28:34.920 --> 28:37.880
music, dancing, French.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.920
So climb on.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.680
I won't harm you; look.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.040
We had a girl who left

28:45.040 --> 28:48.320
to be mistress to
the Duke of Norfolk.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.800
So.

28:57.800 --> 29:01.680
You will teach my cunny French?

29:01.680 --> 29:03.440
Oui.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.880
Stay.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.520
You need rest.

29:11.520 --> 29:14.760
I must sort things for Lucy.

29:14.760 --> 29:17.400
I've reserved the box.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.800
The word is out.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.000
You will have bids.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.160
See what I've been
keeping for you?

30:03.040 --> 30:05.240
My mother took me down
St. Martin's Lane.

30:05.240 --> 30:08.720
She'd spent every last farthing
on her gin, the slut--

30:08.720 --> 30:11.960
and she was a bunter;
no one'd go near her.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.480
She sold me to a bawd
for a pair of shoes.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.560
I was ten.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.280
I know.

30:25.160 --> 30:28.520
Do you know that woman's name?

30:28.520 --> 30:30.480
Mrs. Quigley.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.960
She dressed me warm,

30:34.960 --> 30:38.760
she gave me a full meal.

30:38.760 --> 30:41.560
She said if I pleased
her gentlemen,

30:41.560 --> 30:45.760
I'd be her own sweet girl.

30:45.760 --> 30:50.000
I swore it wouldn't
be like that for you.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.240
I gave you schooling.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.720
I gave you time.

30:59.960 --> 31:01.480
Do you like them?

31:04.480 --> 31:06.080
They don't fit.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.240
Then make them.

31:36.040 --> 31:38.400
Howard!

31:38.400 --> 31:39.760
Where's your fine lady?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.520
In Richmond.

31:41.520 --> 31:43.480
Not your wife, man!

31:43.480 --> 31:46.160
He means Miss Wells.

31:46.160 --> 31:51.200
Lord Repton is besotted
with Miss Wells.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.040
The sister comes out tonight,

31:53.040 --> 31:54.320
have you heard?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.880
Wells junior.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.080
Maidenhood to
the highest bidder,

31:58.080 --> 32:01.560
and I swear that will be me.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.480
My husband loves a hymen.

32:06.280 --> 32:08.040
I had Charlotte's.

32:08.040 --> 32:12.240
I would like her sister's too.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.040
All there for the taking, Lucy.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.800
Snuff?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.720
I've carried you
before, Miss Wells.

33:06.720 --> 33:08.000
I'd be insulted
you don't recall

33:08.000 --> 33:11.480
only I was at the back.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.800
Now I've graduated
to the front.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.440
Congratulations.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.320
But I won't be doing
this for very long.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.520
I thought I might set
myself up as a fancy-man.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.440
There must be many a lady
who'd pay for a throw

33:21.440 --> 33:24.640
with a well-shaped man like me.

33:24.640 --> 33:27.440
My price is very fair.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.400
I'd even give you
the first one for free.

33:29.400 --> 33:30.920
Nothing comes for free, sir.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.560
You would, I guarantee it.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.000
Right, Seamus.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.960
You're a harlot, sir.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.960
You lied to me.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.520
You went out every
night I was away.

34:39.520 --> 34:44.560
Yes, but all of London
knows my constancy.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.360
So why do you not
sign my contract?

34:46.360 --> 34:48.040
I don't want to be
owned, like your wife.

34:48.040 --> 34:50.280
Then I have no
surety of your faith.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.600
You have my word.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.960
A whore's word?

34:57.120 --> 35:02.120
Take it or not,
as you please.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.800
What have you done?

35:18.800 --> 35:21.960
Why does he scorn you?

35:21.960 --> 35:24.560
I won't sign
his poxy contract.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.200
You are the village idiot.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.760
Lucy.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.440
Lucy!

35:52.440 --> 35:53.800
Lucy.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.120
Whatever is the matter?

35:56.120 --> 35:57.840
Control yourself.

35:57.840 --> 36:00.800
You must shine!

36:08.160 --> 36:11.480
-Lord Repton.
-My dear.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.040
Let me see her.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.000
Silly girl.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.440
The opera moves her.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.000
She cries.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.960
Why, the poor lamb...

36:25.360 --> 36:28.120
Please.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.440
May I offer you this note?

36:32.920 --> 36:36.600
Gentlemen, I'm
considering all bids.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.520
I'm not ready.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.400
It's not hard.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.560
You'll learn to be the
Queen of Pretend, as I am.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.640
You know why the men
sing so high, don't you?

36:56.200 --> 36:58.360
Done to them when
they're little boys

36:58.360 --> 37:01.200
to stop their voices breaking.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.600
That's the cruelty
of the opera.

37:03.600 --> 37:07.040
The subject is love,
but the men have no balls

37:07.040 --> 37:10.000
and the virgins are
all played by whores.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.760
The tears worked,
you clever minx.

37:17.760 --> 37:20.120
They want you more than ever.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.560
Nancy sent me.

37:26.560 --> 37:28.280
Who signed that warrant?

37:28.280 --> 37:29.680
Charles Quigley.

37:35.280 --> 37:36.800
Lydia Quigley!

37:36.800 --> 37:40.000
Are you coming after me
with lawmen and judges?

37:40.000 --> 37:41.320
You?

37:41.320 --> 37:45.800
See how this sluice rat
behaves at the opera.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.800
I want one hundred pounds or
I'll have you up before a judge

37:47.800 --> 37:50.040
for a malicious prosecution.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.600
Do you really think
you'll have the judge's ear?

37:54.120 --> 37:58.040
Oh--one of your girls
came to me today.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.880
A pert little doxie by
the name of Emily Lacey.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.560
A very rideable piece.

38:02.560 --> 38:04.120
She's mine now.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.520
You cannot steal my girls!

38:05.520 --> 38:09.320
She implored me to take her
from your flyblown cunny house.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.800
Damn you for a kidnapping pimp!

38:10.800 --> 38:12.040
Come, my doves.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.040
Let's leave this rat
to eat its young.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.480
He offers twice
the highest bid.

38:30.480 --> 38:31.840
For me?

38:35.200 --> 38:36.680
We need the money.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.520
Then take it.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.520
If you are free
to lie and cheat

38:50.520 --> 38:52.480
and play the whore,
then so will I be.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.560
Look at this quagmire
you've come from.

39:06.560 --> 39:08.320
Look at what
I've done for you!

39:08.320 --> 39:11.440
Your sister will realize
I am quite man enough.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.360
You may wait.

39:19.360 --> 39:22.280
I'd rather be cut in quarters.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.800
Charlotte!

39:23.800 --> 39:26.000
Charlotte, you infernal whore!

39:29.800 --> 39:32.040
I'll go after her, my lord.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.880
We are honored
by your generous bid.

39:34.880 --> 39:37.360
My precious girl.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.440
I am yours, my lord.

39:47.520 --> 39:49.200
Why are you driving him away?

39:49.200 --> 39:50.880
He's an easy keeper.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.960
He's a snake.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.320
You could have him dropping
jewels on your pillow,

39:58.320 --> 40:01.880
but no, you provoke
him to this spite!

40:01.880 --> 40:03.560
Indulge him.

40:03.560 --> 40:05.440
Take his contract.

40:05.440 --> 40:08.760
I'm thinking about your future.

40:08.760 --> 40:12.200
You have never, ever had
to sell yourself for pence

40:12.200 --> 40:13.840
or beg for food.

40:13.840 --> 40:16.120
My ma sold me for
a pair of shoes.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.600
I've heard about those
shoes so many times

40:17.600 --> 40:21.080
I could start a cobbler's.

40:21.080 --> 40:23.920
The only safety is in money!

40:23.920 --> 40:25.960
I hate money!

40:27.640 --> 40:33.400
Money is a woman's only
power in this world.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.600
Make it your solace
and your dream

40:36.600 --> 40:41.360
and one day wealth,
real lasting wealth,

40:41.360 --> 40:43.480
will make you free.

40:43.480 --> 40:45.080
Are you free?

40:45.080 --> 40:51.000
I will be, when I'm
in my new house.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.920
Thank you, Ma,
for all you've done

40:54.920 --> 40:57.560
for Lucy and for me.

40:57.560 --> 41:00.600
You never, ever sold us short.

41:11.800 --> 41:15.160
I can't get it in, you slog!

41:26.600 --> 41:30.480
I'm soft as a rotted
fruit, curse you!

41:30.480 --> 41:32.560
You're the most
hideous piece of flesh

41:32.560 --> 41:34.760
I've ever had in my life,

41:34.760 --> 41:38.920
even more insipid than
my dull, fatiguing wife.

41:42.640 --> 41:44.800
You're clearly frigid,
still a virgin.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.440
I shall ask your mother
for my money back.

41:46.440 --> 41:52.040
No...please, my lord,
just tell me what to do.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.640
I've had enough of you!

41:54.640 --> 41:56.120
I'll do anything you like,
just don't tell my ma.

42:02.840 --> 42:08.040
In return for my silence,
you will tell everyone

42:08.040 --> 42:11.480
that I impaled you, hard.

42:14.000 --> 42:19.920
When Charlotte asks what it
was like, what will you say?

42:19.920 --> 42:23.160
It was like the opera.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Do you need a ride?

43:54.000 --> 43:55.440
My offer still stands.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.640
Like I said,
first one for free.

43:57.640 --> 43:59.880
Think like a whore.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.840
How much can you get?

44:02.840 --> 44:05.040
A guinea.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.120
For what?

44:07.120 --> 44:08.480
Sell me your charms.

44:08.480 --> 44:09.840
I offer you love.

44:09.840 --> 44:12.600
Then you're a fool.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.960
For a harlot,
that doesn't exist.

44:17.560 --> 44:20.680
Then I have nothing.

44:20.680 --> 44:24.280
Hunger in my stomach
and a mouth full of breeze.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.880
Here's tuppence.

44:31.880 --> 44:35.040
What's that for?

44:35.040 --> 44:37.120
Your company.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.000
I want your forgiveness.

45:04.760 --> 45:06.080
Eight shillings.

45:55.960 --> 45:58.440
I prayed for boys, William.

46:00.400 --> 46:04.280
Every time,
I prayed for a boy.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.840
She's strong.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.440
Like her mother.

46:18.360 --> 46:23.080
This city is
made of our flesh,

46:23.080 --> 46:26.440
every beam, every brick.

46:30.480 --> 46:33.000
We'll have our piece of it.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.440
Sting Margaret Wells.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.120
Don't confront her.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.160
Quigley must be stood up to.

46:52.160 --> 46:53.800
I must strike back!

46:55.520 --> 46:58.520
Leave my house
or conflict there will be.

46:58.520 --> 47:00.040
I'm quaking with fear.

47:01.880 --> 47:04.360
I told them I'd try
my chances in America.

47:04.360 --> 47:06.920
-I'm leaving.
-I say when you leave!

47:06.920 --> 47:09.360
Thank you, Ma, for
the gift of whoring.

47:09.360 --> 47:12.400
-I'm no good at this.
-You have to have a keeper!

47:15.680 --> 47:16.800
I want Lucy.

47:16.800 --> 47:19.200
Your daughter is a goddess.

47:19.200 --> 47:21.320
What will happen if I say no?

47:25.920 --> 47:27.960
Now that's how a whore
makes an entrance.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.520
Kindness is a cruelty.

47:32.520 --> 47:34.560
I will bring her down.

47:34.560 --> 47:38.000
To capture beasts,
you must have bait.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.880
You are a monster!

47:41.040 --> 47:41.920
Bitch!

47:44.280 --> 47:47.000
-Ma!
-Charles, speak to me!

47:47.000 --> 47:48.520
We'll hang for this.

47:49.960 --> 47:52.120
London is a den of peril.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.440
No one is safe.
