A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÃ’ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.520 --> 00:22.280
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:32.200 --> 00:34.880
CATS ARE SUPERIOR

04:13.200 --> 04:15.120
What have you done?

04:16.280 --> 04:18.040
She's dead.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.560
I'm going to kill you!

04:41.160 --> 04:42.880
I'm going to kill you!

04:49.080 --> 04:50.600
Bitch!

05:29.720 --> 05:31.280
Die!

08:18.680 --> 08:20.160
Come here.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.440
Come to me.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.760
GOD'S GONE

12:52.160 --> 12:53.560
Anna.

13:10.560 --> 13:12.040
What happened to you?

13:26.920 --> 13:29.160
I've lost my brother.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.040
It's not fair.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.080
Astor!

14:06.400 --> 14:08.000
Get out!

14:21.520 --> 14:22.880
Well?

14:23.240 --> 14:24.600
He's not here.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.840
Astor!

14:46.320 --> 14:49.000
You need to rest, let's go home.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.080
I have to go.

14:59.560 --> 15:00.960
Where?

15:04.920 --> 15:06.560
Somewhere.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.920
You coming back?

15:23.200 --> 15:24.440
Wait!

15:27.840 --> 15:30.080
You're not going anywhere without me.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.800
Mister.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.600
Mister.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.080
I'm Pietro, from building B.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.920
- What do you want?
- At home... my mama.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.600
- What do you want?
- Mama's not well.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.800
Please, you gotta come.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.760
- Where?
- That way.

16:27.840 --> 16:29.960
Let's see what's good to eat.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.080
You have these and you don't share 'em?

16:41.760 --> 16:44.480
Your mother's done for,
it's too late for the hospital,

16:44.640 --> 16:46.680
it's full of people dying there.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.280
Listen.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.040
Listen carefully.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.960
- Do you really want to help your mother?
- Yes.

17:06.360 --> 17:07.800
Another one.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.720
Don't worry, my dear, it'll be all right.

17:37.120 --> 17:40.480
Now we'll free you
from this shell of pain.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.960
Squirt, go get me two plastic bags.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.440
One's not enough, it could break, okay?

18:08.720 --> 18:12.920
Now I'll put the bags over her head
and she'll stop suffering.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.120
Get on top of her.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.920
No, on top, lie over her.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.040
Come on, lie down flat.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.560
Come on.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.400
That's it, good boy.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.040
Now, hug her.

18:41.080 --> 18:46.000
Now your mother's soul
will leave her body,

18:47.360 --> 18:49.600
it'll pass through you

18:50.120 --> 18:53.600
and you'll feel it slip inside you,
like a caress.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.680
It'll be her last goodbye, for good.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.160
Do you understand?

19:02.360 --> 19:03.560
Go.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.240
Are you ready?

19:08.520 --> 19:09.720
Ready.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.560
Did you feel her?

19:42.520 --> 19:45.280
I saw your mother's soul,

19:46.840 --> 19:49.560
it was shining, so brightly.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.280
- I didn't see it.
- You can't, it's invisible.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.320
- I've got special glasses.
- Where did she go?

20:01.520 --> 20:03.680
She's flying around the world,

20:03.880 --> 20:06.960
together with the souls of all the others

20:07.800 --> 20:10.480
like her, who are dead.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.680
All together, they're going
to Etna, the volcano,

20:15.240 --> 20:17.600
they pass through the crater

20:18.160 --> 20:20.560
into a better dimension.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.840
What's a synonym for rich?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.400
Wealthy.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.480
You're too young, but if you could
understand what I'm writing,

21:05.680 --> 21:07.840
you'd say I'm a genius.

21:10.560 --> 21:13.160
You're not going to die,
are you, Saverio?

21:14.160 --> 21:17.280
Of course not, I'm different.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.320
Look.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.440
Look.

21:24.160 --> 21:26.120
Not a single blotch.

21:27.200 --> 21:30.320
I've never been better in my whole life.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.400
I'm pervaded by grace.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.800
Know what that means?

21:38.000 --> 21:42.840
Grace is when God sees you and says:
"Okay, you're a good guy."

21:43.520 --> 21:47.440
God spared very few
chosen ones from the virus.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.160
I'm a bard,

21:51.640 --> 21:56.600
my mission is to chronicle
the end and the rebirth.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.080
Come here.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.920
I name you my assistant.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.720
We'll start from there
and go through all the houses.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.000
It's all right.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.160
You're about to be freed.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.360
Squirt.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.720
Yum.

24:06.240 --> 24:10.200
Soon, my dear assistant,
our mission will be accomplished.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.200
- And we'll go away.
- Where?

24:13.400 --> 24:15.560
To visit the Etna sanctuary.

24:15.880 --> 24:19.240
- It snows there in winter, can you ski?
- No.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.240
Me neither.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.440
How much farther?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.560
Not much, see?

25:04.200 --> 25:05.760
Are you awake?

25:07.240 --> 25:08.440
Yeah.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.160
Can't sleep?

25:13.960 --> 25:14.920
No.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.760
You?

25:19.400 --> 25:21.120
Me neither.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.600
What are you thinking about?

25:28.240 --> 25:30.120
My dogs.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.320
I had two.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.240
Dogs live 14 years, like us.

25:38.360 --> 25:41.560
It's true, I never thought about it.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.560
In 14 years they do everything,

25:45.920 --> 25:48.280
they're born, they live, they die.

25:49.360 --> 25:53.720
In the end, what counts is not
how long you live, but how you live.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.160
If lived to the fullest,

25:57.600 --> 26:00.000
a short life is as good as a long one.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.440
Don't you think?

26:06.040 --> 26:07.160
Yes.

26:15.760 --> 26:17.640
I really like you.

27:40.720 --> 27:42.000
Hi.

27:46.520 --> 27:49.120
- What are you doing?
- Shining shoes.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.640
- What's your name?
- 'Ndraveche.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.840
Cool, 'Ndraveche.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.880
I made it up myself.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.880
- And what's your name?
- Astor.

28:05.760 --> 28:09.480
- Did you make that up too?
- No, my mama did.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.240
It's nice here.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.040
Yeah.

28:21.320 --> 28:23.960
Do you know a lake
called The Reeds?

28:25.040 --> 28:29.120
Where there's a blond boy
called Pietro?

28:36.680 --> 28:38.840
Want to see something special?

28:39.320 --> 28:41.560
- Is it far away?
- No.

28:47.520 --> 28:48.880
Are we friends?

28:57.400 --> 29:00.240
- Can I come in?
- Not yet.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.280
Can I help you?

29:13.840 --> 29:15.200
One?

29:17.640 --> 29:19.000
One.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.480
1,500 euros.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.600
Thank you, sir.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.360
Right, it's all there.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.320
Do you want to walk or to go by car?

29:31.840 --> 29:35.040
- By car.
- Okay, it's the same price.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.960
- But I have to blindfold you.
- Okay.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.920
You can take the blindfold off.

30:46.480 --> 30:47.720
Hi, Astor.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.040
Hi.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.960
Who are you?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.320
I'm Tonino.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.680
Hi, Tonino.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.280
- How do you know my name?
- I know everything.

31:01.120 --> 31:03.320
I died eating an old <i>pandoro</i>.

31:04.360 --> 31:08.400
- What's <i>pandoro</i>?
- Like a brother to <i>panettone</i>, a cake.

31:09.680 --> 31:11.280
Cakes...

31:12.600 --> 31:16.640
Shush, you can't talk! This is theater!

31:21.000 --> 31:24.880
This is the tale
of Tonino and 'Ndraveche,

31:25.240 --> 31:27.440
the greatest of friendships.

31:27.840 --> 31:31.920
'Ndraveche and I were always together,
we did puppet shows.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.120
Then I died

31:35.440 --> 31:37.760
and 'Ndraveche was left all alone.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.560
You, Astor, do you want
to become 'Ndraveche's friend?

31:42.760 --> 31:45.320
You can use all the puppets you want.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.520
Yes.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.640
Why do you make us eat with sticks?

31:57.960 --> 32:00.680
Chinese people eat with chopsticks,

32:01.240 --> 32:04.000
to be faster, so they get full quicker.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.400
I don't like Chinese food.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.480
Seriously?

32:09.680 --> 32:13.480
My father's a great expert
in Chinese food,

32:13.680 --> 32:18.440
once he took me to China
to taste egg rolls.

33:27.680 --> 33:29.600
There's a wire!

33:33.000 --> 33:35.400
- Are you okay?
- Just a scratch on my leg.

33:35.600 --> 33:39.440
WELCOME TO "NUCCI'S" ETNA

33:40.640 --> 33:42.520
Who are they?

33:43.200 --> 33:44.800
Welcome!

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
Welcome to Etna!

33:55.560 --> 33:57.520
You've arrived at Customs.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.680
It's been ages since anyone came.

34:02.280 --> 34:03.400
Hi.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.760
You want to see the volcano?
It's spectacular.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.280
Yes.

34:13.400 --> 34:16.920
Unfortunately,
you need permission to go up.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.040
Permission from whom?

34:28.280 --> 34:31.280
Permission from Nucci, that's me.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.280
Around here, everything is mine,

34:35.480 --> 34:39.560
every stone, every plant,
every grain of asphalt, too.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.880
After the Red Fever
there are no laws,

34:43.080 --> 34:45.240
everyone can do what they want.

34:47.040 --> 34:49.360
You're contradicting yourself.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.000
You say everyone can do what they want

34:53.480 --> 34:56.400
and isn't that a law?

34:57.520 --> 35:00.080
As you can see, laws still exist.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.840
My father was a lawyer in Catania,

35:05.360 --> 35:07.120
Luigi Nucci, criminal lawyer.

35:07.680 --> 35:09.440
Can we go up?

35:09.640 --> 35:13.600
As I said, there's the Nucci protocol,
you need permission.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.400
Do we have your permission?

35:19.200 --> 35:23.120
Wait a minute.
Let me take a good look at you.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.560
If I go through anyway, what happens?

35:37.320 --> 35:39.200
Something bad happens.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.720
Nucci, will you let us through, please?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.840
There's an exception to my law,

35:56.040 --> 35:58.560
pretty girls can go through.

35:59.840 --> 36:01.600
Ugly boys can't.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.720
Fine, I'm ugly and you're handsome.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.400
Let's go, Anna, forget about it.

36:14.680 --> 36:17.240
You've gone past the wire,
you're in deep shit.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.920
Yeah, yeah.

36:19.360 --> 36:20.560
See ya.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.320
Wait.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.000
Go.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.920
Open up, assholes!

37:08.560 --> 37:10.840
What the fuck are you putting on me?

37:14.960 --> 37:16.320
Be still.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.520
Let go of me!

37:56.080 --> 37:58.320
You need to be patient.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.960
You know the story of the boa,
the cat and the dog?

38:10.800 --> 38:13.440
An enormous boa constrictor eats a cat.

38:15.080 --> 38:19.640
You know, you can live
in a python's stomach for years.

38:22.360 --> 38:26.440
So the cat gets cozy,
makes a bed and waits.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.760
One day, the boa finds a dog.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.720
And what does he do? He eats him.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.600
So, in the python's stomach
there are a cat and a dog,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.360
that have always hated each other.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.840
The dog says to the cat:

38:55.040 --> 38:57.520
"I know we hate each other's guts,

38:58.200 --> 39:02.320
but if we want to get out of here
we've got to team up."

39:04.160 --> 39:08.560
The cat replies that it's impossible
because he's a cat

39:09.640 --> 39:11.520
and he jumps at him.

39:11.720 --> 39:15.880
They go at each other,
biting and scratching.

39:18.200 --> 39:21.880
The python feels
an insane pain inside him,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.080
an incredible tussle.

39:24.280 --> 39:27.240
Then the cat makes a gash,

39:28.120 --> 39:31.840
an enormous gash,
and they both come out of it.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.360
The python dies, they're alive.

39:35.560 --> 39:38.040
Covered in shit, but they're alive.

39:39.040 --> 39:41.440
So the dog says to the cat:

39:42.200 --> 39:45.880
"Peace?"
And the cat replies: "No fucking way.

39:46.440 --> 39:50.320
If we didn't hate each other,
we'd be dead by now."

39:50.880 --> 39:52.240
You get it?

39:53.040 --> 39:54.920
No, what does it mean?

39:55.640 --> 39:58.360
That war's war
and cats are superior.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.120
Nucci.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.800
- Are you done?
- All done.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.240
What did you do to him?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.800
Why?

40:11.000 --> 40:14.640
That's what happens when
you pass the wire without my permission.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.880
He'll die with that on his head.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.320
Piece of shit.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.600
Now you can go up to the volcano.

40:27.720 --> 40:28.960
Take it off him.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.960
Why don't you try and take it off?

40:32.160 --> 40:34.840
Anna, forget it, let's go.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.520
I'm going to rest for a bit.

41:03.240 --> 41:05.800
Stop. That's enough.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.680
We need to find a screwdriver
or some pliers.

41:14.280 --> 41:16.160
It's no good with rocks.

41:17.800 --> 41:21.040
We won't find anything farther up,
let's go back down.

41:21.960 --> 41:24.280
No, those guys are there.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.640
I have to climb the volcano.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.240
Maybe we'll find something farther up.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.040
- Can you breathe, at least?
- Yeah.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.240
Can you make it?

42:44.800 --> 42:46.880
<i>Saverio, you've got a blotch.</i>

42:50.040 --> 42:52.200
What the fuck did you say, Squirt?

42:53.720 --> 42:55.920
What the fuck did you say?

42:56.120 --> 42:57.880
You've got a blotch.

42:59.760 --> 43:03.400
I can't have any blotches,
I am the chosen one.

43:04.880 --> 43:07.360
I am pervaded by grace.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.840
- Where?
- On your back.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.320
- Where, on my back?
- The right side.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.160
Go away.

44:11.520 --> 44:13.800
- Where to?
- I don't give a fuck!

44:14.000 --> 44:17.200
I don't give a fuck where you go,
you hear me?

44:18.920 --> 44:22.840
It's all dead people here!
Go be with kids your own age!

44:27.640 --> 44:28.960
Go away!

44:33.560 --> 44:35.520
Do whatever the fuck you want.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.000
Get out.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.040
Where are you going?

45:18.240 --> 45:20.200
I said get out.

45:23.920 --> 45:26.080
- Can I come...?
- Get out!

45:32.920 --> 45:35.400
Get out of this fucking car!

46:33.200 --> 46:34.840
It's boiling.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.280
- What?
- I'm thirsty.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.080
Tilt your head back.

47:03.640 --> 47:04.840
More.

47:46.600 --> 47:49.400
Pietro, there's nothing here.

47:51.160 --> 47:52.880
That's not true,

47:53.720 --> 47:56.240
from here,
the souls return to the Creator,

47:56.440 --> 47:58.800
they leave the body,

47:59.000 --> 48:03.840
they cross the world, the sea
and they arrive here.

48:05.400 --> 48:09.000
They enter the volcano
and rise up to Heaven.

48:10.880 --> 48:13.280
This is happening here,

48:14.320 --> 48:16.040
right now.

48:17.040 --> 48:19.960
Where? I can't see anything.

48:20.160 --> 48:22.440
Because they're invisible.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.520
I've got some glasses
in my front pocket, get them out.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.640
These?

48:41.440 --> 48:43.800
My friend Saverio gave them to me.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.760
With these you can see the souls.

48:49.400 --> 48:50.880
Put them on me.

49:00.600 --> 49:02.160
I can't.

49:04.920 --> 49:07.480
Hold a lens against a hole.

49:15.120 --> 49:16.840
You see anything?

49:20.520 --> 49:22.320
Only more yellow.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.880
Let's go back down, what do you say?

49:31.000 --> 49:32.720
You try them on.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.280
Well?

49:54.080 --> 49:56.920
- I can't see anything.
- Are you sure?

49:57.760 --> 49:59.480
Look harder.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.440
There's one down there.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
And another one up there.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.800
What are they like?

50:18.680 --> 50:21.080
Like luminous jellyfish.

50:24.600 --> 50:25.920
Beautiful.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.840
I knew it.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.400
Pietro, let's go.

50:36.480 --> 50:39.080
It'll be dark soon, come on.

50:39.600 --> 50:41.400
No, I'm staying here.

50:42.200 --> 50:44.920
I can't do it, I'm exhausted.

50:45.840 --> 50:47.280
You go.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.720
Let's go, you can't stay here.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.880
Please.

51:02.880 --> 51:04.520
All right.

51:06.160 --> 51:07.800
We'll stay here.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.880
The mainland.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.560
Please, say something.

54:52.960 --> 54:54.680
In my backpack...

54:59.240 --> 55:01.680
there are two plastic bags...

55:04.720 --> 55:06.400
get them.

56:06.760 --> 56:08.360
Saverio.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.600
Can you hear me? It's Pietro.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.560
Assistant, how are you?

56:36.040 --> 56:37.800
Good and you?

56:38.960 --> 56:40.440
I feel like shit.

56:52.040 --> 56:54.120
You got two plastic bags?
