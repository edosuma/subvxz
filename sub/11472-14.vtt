you can go see

You can go see
The Rolling Stones
at Altamont, too.

Come on, Dad.
Don't make a big deal
out of it.

00:11.044 --> 00:13.046
It would be so much fun.

00:13.079 --> 00:14.615
I'm sure it'd be fun.

in a cloud of

wag his bloody tongue?

it's terrific.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.996
Ben Fredricks.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.968
Excuse me. I have
to use the restroom.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.037
We don't have
a restroom.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.872
We have a toilet.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.419
Just calm down.
I've stolen
hall passes like,

10:19.452 --> 10:20.587
eight times
in the past week.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.689
It's fine.
Ha ha ha!

10:24.725 --> 10:26.159
Hey, Millie,
what's wrong?

10:27.493 --> 10:28.562
Goliath's dead.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.831
Oh, God, Millie.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.199
(SNORTS)
Who's Goliath?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.668
Goliath's her dog.

10:35.536 --> 10:37.103
What happened?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.406
Some maniac ran over him
last night with their car.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.012
God, Millie...

10:46.046 --> 10:48.582
Someone hit him
with a car?
That's horrible.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.416
I'm so sorry.

10:51.652 --> 10:53.820
He must've gotten out.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.923
(WEEPING) My dad found
him on the street

10:56.957 --> 10:58.859
right between
our houses.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.334
The worst part is...

11:09.603 --> 11:11.171
They didn't even stop.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.276
Who would do that?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.783
Well, I gotta
go to class.

11:22.816 --> 11:26.452
I have a test.
See you.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.389
Yeah, see you,
Millie.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.960
Oh, my God.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.363
Lindsay...
We killed Millie's dog.

11:43.770 --> 11:46.306
Hey, guys...

11:46.339 --> 11:48.308
I killed Millie's dog.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.611
Like, with
your bare hands?

11:50.644 --> 11:52.979
No. I ran it over.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.447
Oh.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.049
You're pretty sick.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.351
I didn't do it
on purpose, doofus.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.220
Yeah, it was
an accident.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.454
I always say...

12:01.487 --> 12:04.390
Girl plus car
equals dead animal.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.425
True.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.361
We have to tell Millie.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.830
Why?

12:09.863 --> 12:12.065
It's not gonna bring
her dog back, Lindsay.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.267
It will just
upset her more.

12:15.536 --> 12:18.238
It's not like you
killed a human being.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.540
It's just a dog.

12:19.573 --> 12:23.544
It's even worse, Ken.
I love dogs.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.512
Why? Dogs suck.

12:25.546 --> 12:28.649
They're stupid,
and they smell,
and they're ugly.

12:28.682 --> 12:30.416
They don't even
like us people.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.686
They pretend to,
but they're just
kissing our asses

12:32.719 --> 12:33.987
so we'll feed 'em.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.289
I ain't buying
into that hoodwink.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.724
Oh, man.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.492
Lindsay...Look.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.128
Oh, God.
Poor Millie.

12:44.230 --> 12:45.832
She's just...

12:45.866 --> 12:49.536
Sitting there...
by herself.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.242
I am telling you,
M.A.S.H. is not funny.

12:56.276 --> 12:59.680
I heard Radar O'Reilly
has, like, no fingers.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.015
That's why he always
carries a clipboard.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.950
Hey, hey, Billy!
You know what?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.286
I'm still stuffed
from your mom's
pot roast.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.121
Why, I couldn't even eat
breakfast this morning,

13:08.154 --> 13:10.090
but I'll tell you,
it was goo‐ood!

13:10.123 --> 13:12.526
I'll see you in
gym class, big guy.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.029
Whoa...
Wait a minute.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.898
What the hell
was that?

13:18.899 --> 13:19.966
What‐‐I‐‐wh‐what?

13:20.000 --> 13:23.103
He ate your mom's
pot roast?

13:23.136 --> 13:25.772
I...really don't
wanna talk about it.

13:25.806 --> 13:28.341
Come on, Bill.
You have to talk
about it.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.278
You can't tell
anyone, ok?

13:32.846 --> 13:36.149
What? Tell us.

13:37.217 --> 13:41.321
My mom is...
Kinda dating
Mr. Fredricks.

13:46.727 --> 13:48.829
Don't say a word.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.396
I didn't say
anything.

13:50.430 --> 13:53.299
Good. Don't.

14:08.414 --> 14:09.415
Hey.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.184
How's it going?

14:12.318 --> 14:14.655
Ok. You?

14:14.688 --> 14:15.922
(SNORTS)

14:15.956 --> 14:19.660
I don't know.
Perlick's gonna
kill me.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.294
I didn't do any
of the assignment.

14:22.395 --> 14:23.396
Me, either.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.032
You kidding me?

14:27.634 --> 14:30.203
I was...
up all night crying.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.143
You know...

14:38.512 --> 14:39.880
I know how you feel.

14:42.816 --> 14:45.085
I had a dog
that died once, too.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.655
What was his name?

14:49.790 --> 14:51.091
Bobo.

14:51.525 --> 14:54.060
He was so smart.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.763
He used to sit
with me and watch TV
all day long.

14:56.797 --> 14:59.132
He loved TV.

14:59.165 --> 15:02.503
Goliath used to attack the TV
if there was a cat on it.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.204
Ha ha ha!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.172
So, what happened?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.309
Well...he was
epileptic...

15:09.342 --> 15:14.615
So, all of a sudden,
he would start to
froth at the mouth,

15:14.648 --> 15:18.051
and then his
little legs would
get all tense,

15:18.084 --> 15:21.955
and he would start
shaking and then...
poop himself.

15:21.988 --> 15:26.359
And get his paws in
the poop and get poop
all over the place.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.630
Aw...Poor puppy.

15:29.663 --> 15:33.600
My parents
couldn't take it.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.035
They didn't
even tell me

15:35.068 --> 15:37.871
that they were going
to put him to sleep.

15:37.904 --> 15:41.942
One day, I got home,
and...he was gone.

15:45.712 --> 15:49.382
I'm putting Goliath to rest
under his favorite tree.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.152
Do you wanna come?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.555
Yeah.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.829
Well...Here comes
Bill's future dad.

16:02.863 --> 16:06.767
Oh, come on, Neal.
We promised Bill we
wouldn't say anything.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.769
We can make jokes
to each other,

16:08.802 --> 16:10.904
just not to Bill.

16:10.937 --> 16:13.840
Besides, I can kinda
see why Mr. Fredricks
is dating her.

16:13.874 --> 16:15.275
She is kinda hot.

16:15.308 --> 16:19.846
Oh, God! She's
your friend's mother.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.047
Weirdo.

16:21.081 --> 16:22.916
All right,
everybody.

16:22.949 --> 16:26.286
We have some potential
basketball superstars
in this class,

16:26.319 --> 16:29.990
so today, we're gonna work
on fundamentals, all right?

16:30.824 --> 16:32.425
Who knows?
Maybe one of you

16:32.458 --> 16:35.095
might even make
the school team
next year.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.298
But, uh, let's
warm up, all right?

16:38.331 --> 16:41.401
10 laps around
the gym. Come on.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.636
Mr. Fredricks?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.870
Yes, Bill?

16:43.904 --> 16:45.506
I can't run.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.040
Why?

16:47.073 --> 16:49.009
I have better
things to do.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.244
Excuse me?

16:51.277 --> 16:53.747
I have better things to do
than run around a gym

16:53.780 --> 16:56.082
and shoot a stupid ball
in a hoop.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.353
Oh, really, Bill?

17:00.386 --> 17:02.022
What better things
do you have to do?

17:02.823 --> 17:04.157
Anything.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.327
Pick my nose
and eat it...

17:07.360 --> 17:11.197
Or read the comics
or go to the bathroom.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.735
Uh, all those are
better than gym class.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.069
Heh! He is so dead.

17:16.102 --> 17:17.470
Kill him, Mr. Fredricks.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.773
Shut up, Alan.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.276
For once in your life,
shut your big, stinkin'
trap, ok?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.779
He was the one‐‐
I'm talking to you.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.614
Shut your mouth.

17:27.648 --> 17:31.484
I've had it with
the constant comments and
the incessant cackling.

17:32.118 --> 17:33.319
You got me?

17:35.455 --> 17:36.857
Ok.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.259
Bill, you're gonna
run the laps...

17:39.292 --> 17:40.627
and you're gonna
do the drills.
You know why?

17:40.661 --> 17:41.895
'Cause this
is my gym.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.397
I'm the teacher.
You're the student.

17:44.430 --> 17:45.431
Ok? Sit down‐‐

17:45.465 --> 17:47.834
You can't tell me
what to do.

17:47.868 --> 17:50.537
You keep walking,
you're in big trouble,
Mr. Haverchuck!

17:50.571 --> 17:53.406
What are you gonna do,
call my mom?

17:53.439 --> 17:54.941
Hey, Bill!

17:54.975 --> 17:56.209
Leave me alone.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.216
(WHISPERING) Never
thought I'd say this,

18:03.249 --> 18:05.686
but Haverchuck's the king!
Heh heh heh.

18:07.688 --> 18:10.757
MILLIE: You were
always there for me,
my entire life,

18:12.225 --> 18:14.327
but I know you're
with Jesus now,

18:14.360 --> 18:17.698
and you're happy in heaven
with all the other dogs,

18:17.731 --> 18:19.533
and you can run and play,

18:19.566 --> 18:22.335
and you never have to be
on a leash again...

18:22.368 --> 18:24.605
'Cause there are
no leashes in heaven.

18:26.039 --> 18:30.443
You're my favorite puppy.
I love you, Goliath.

18:33.179 --> 18:35.015
Lindsay, you wanna
say something?

18:35.048 --> 18:36.517
Huh?

18:36.550 --> 18:39.520
Do you wanna say
something to Goliath?

18:39.553 --> 18:42.723
Um...No. That's ok.

18:43.657 --> 18:44.658
Lindsay...

18:46.059 --> 18:48.529
Say something
to Goliath.

18:51.765 --> 18:52.833
Um...

18:54.134 --> 18:55.335
Goliath...

18:57.103 --> 19:01.307
You were a sweet dog,
and...

19:03.209 --> 19:05.779
You had really nice fur...

19:07.213 --> 19:11.284
And...There's no leashes
in heaven...

19:11.885 --> 19:13.119
I already said that.

19:13.153 --> 19:18.124
Oh. Um...I remember when

19:18.158 --> 19:20.326
my mom used to come over
in her furry boots

19:20.360 --> 19:22.663
and you would
hump her foot...

19:22.696 --> 19:24.197
Ha!

19:24.230 --> 19:25.932
And we thought
that was funny...

19:25.966 --> 19:30.470
And then you got spayed,
and you didn't do it
anymore.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.140
And we're not sad now
because...

19:34.174 --> 19:39.613
you lived a very long...
Long, happy life.

19:39.646 --> 19:40.647
That's right.

19:41.247 --> 19:43.717
A long
and happy life.

19:43.750 --> 19:48.421

20:52.318 --> 20:53.820
Hey, Linds,
your old man

20:53.854 --> 20:55.956
make up his mind yet
about the concert?

20:55.989 --> 20:58.525
Huh? Nah,
but count me in.

20:58.559 --> 20:59.960
He's just making
me sweat it.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.796
After school,
Kim and I are going
to the record store.

21:02.829 --> 21:03.930
You wanna come?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.499
Uh... What?

21:06.533 --> 21:08.034
I'm gonna buy
some Who albums

21:08.068 --> 21:10.070
so I can sing along
to the concert.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.506
You're going
to The Who concert?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.075
Millie, what about
your parents?

21:15.108 --> 21:18.344
Ever since my dog died,
they've been letting
me do anything.

21:18.378 --> 21:21.948
Well, I'm gonna go
home and study for
my trig test.

21:21.982 --> 21:25.552
Right, Millie?
Don't you think
you should study?

21:25.586 --> 21:28.288
Oh, yeah.
That's right.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.123
I forgot about that.

21:30.156 --> 21:32.893
Well, you know...
Blow it off.

21:32.926 --> 21:35.962
You're in mourning.
You can't be expected
to do homework.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.464
Good point.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.466
I guess I'm gonna
blow it off.

21:40.500 --> 21:44.605
Oh, my God.
I am so bad.

21:44.638 --> 21:47.207
All right, I'll
meet you out front
right after school,

21:47.240 --> 21:48.509
and we'll go
to the mall.

21:48.542 --> 21:49.910
And you're gonna
wear your big coat,
right?

21:49.943 --> 21:51.244
The one with
the pockets?

21:51.277 --> 21:54.515
Ok. See you, Linds.

21:54.548 --> 21:57.083
She loves my big coat.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.485
She's been talking
about it all day.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.454
Millie, please don't
wear your big coat.

22:01.487 --> 22:04.190
Lindsay, when you
started hanging out
with them,

22:04.224 --> 22:08.294
I felt kinda bad for you
because I thought you would
turn into a dirtbag.

22:08.328 --> 22:11.965
But then I realized that
you were just exploring,

kind of exploring, too.

(INTRO TO SQUEEZE BOX

22:27.948 --> 22:29.215
It's kinda catchy.

Yeah. I like
the banjo.

22:51.905 --> 22:53.139

Hey, Kim.

23:24.037 --> 23:25.305
Oh, hey.

23:25.338 --> 23:26.540
Hey, will you
do me a favor?

23:26.573 --> 23:28.675
Will you give this
to Ken?

23:29.910 --> 23:32.045
You're copying
Ken's homework?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.580
Attempting to.

23:33.614 --> 23:36.482
He writes like
a mental patient.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.521
I was thinking,

23:40.554 --> 23:43.423
we should tell Millie
the truth.

23:43.456 --> 23:45.391
We can't do that.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.594
We have to.
Why?

23:47.628 --> 23:50.797
Because she's gonna wind up
getting into trouble.

23:50.831 --> 23:53.266
Why? 'Cause she's
hanging out with us?

23:53.299 --> 23:54.735
What's the difference?

23:54.768 --> 23:56.436
You're only hanging out
with her 'cause you
feel guilty.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.004
No, I'm not.

23:58.038 --> 23:59.740
She's kinda funny.

23:59.773 --> 24:02.208
Yeah, but you don't
know Millie.

24:02.242 --> 24:03.577
She's really smart,

24:03.610 --> 24:04.878
and she really
loves church,

24:04.911 --> 24:07.013
and she loves
her family a lot‐‐

24:07.047 --> 24:08.314
And what, we're scum?

24:08.348 --> 24:09.583
No. That's not
what I'm saying.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.752
Well, what are
you saying, Lindsay?

24:11.785 --> 24:14.187
I just don't think
we should interfere
with her life.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.924
What are you so worried
about anyway, you know?

24:17.958 --> 24:19.826
That Millie's gonna start
hanging out with us

24:19.860 --> 24:21.628
and then you're not gonna
have anyone to run to

24:21.662 --> 24:23.697
when you get scared
of your bad friends?

24:23.730 --> 24:24.798
Kim.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.900
And you know what,
if you do tell her,

24:26.933 --> 24:28.101
I'll kick your ass.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.345
I don't know
what else I can do.

24:39.379 --> 24:41.548
If he hates me,
he hates me.

24:41.582 --> 24:43.349
He's just having
a really hard time
with this.

24:43.383 --> 24:44.951
Well, so am I.

24:44.985 --> 24:47.220
Honey, you just need
to spend more time
with him.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.656
You need to get
to know each other
a little bit better.

24:49.690 --> 24:52.125
Look, he doesn't
want to know me.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.326
He doesn't care.

24:53.359 --> 24:54.595
Oh, come on.

24:54.628 --> 24:56.563
Don't be
such a baby.

24:56.597 --> 24:59.065
Come here. Come here.

24:59.099 --> 25:00.567
What?

25:03.269 --> 25:05.906
You should take him
someplace special.

25:05.939 --> 25:08.008
You know, show him
that you like him.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.442
What, like the movies?

25:09.475 --> 25:11.912
I'm not seeing
that Stripes crap again.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.479
He's been bugging me
to take him

25:13.514 --> 25:15.782
to this
Go‐Cart City place,

25:15.816 --> 25:17.551
but I keep
saying no.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.185
Maybe you could
take him there.

25:19.219 --> 25:20.386
Really? I love
Go‐Cart City.

25:20.420 --> 25:21.755
You do?
I do.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.724
Yeah, I'll take him there.

25:23.757 --> 25:25.859
Really?
Yeah.

25:25.892 --> 25:27.661
He's fat.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.462
He's a gym teacher,
and he's not even
in good shape.

25:29.495 --> 25:30.864
He never runs,

25:30.897 --> 25:33.399
and you never see him
play the games with us.

25:33.433 --> 25:35.135
NEAL: You should
tell your mom
to dump him.

25:35.168 --> 25:38.138
Even if he wasn't
the biggest jerk
in the world,

25:38.171 --> 25:39.439
he has
a terrible job.

25:39.472 --> 25:40.807
He's a gym teacher.

25:40.841 --> 25:42.809
There's no
upward mobility.

25:42.843 --> 25:44.444
It's not like
you can become...

25:44.477 --> 25:46.913
CEO of a school.

25:46.947 --> 25:49.315
Yeah. My mom really
likes him, you know?

25:49.349 --> 25:51.918
And he acts different
around her than he
does around us.

25:52.586 --> 25:54.320
He's all sweet and phony.

25:55.021 --> 25:55.922
It's sick.

25:55.956 --> 25:59.726
Maybe‐‐maybe he's not
such a bad guy.

26:00.561 --> 26:01.628
Excuse me?

26:01.662 --> 26:04.297
He let you be captain
in gym class.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.667
You're right.
I'll just start
calling him "daddy" now.

26:06.700 --> 26:07.734

26:13.006 --> 26:14.107
Hi, Fredricks.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
Uh, listen, Bill,
I was just wondering,

26:16.176 --> 26:19.045
maybe tomorrow,
you might want to go
to Go‐Cart City with me.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.016
Um...

26:23.049 --> 26:24.651
We'd love to go.

26:25.552 --> 26:28.288
"We"? Uh...

26:28.321 --> 26:30.390
O‐ok.
All right.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.025
We can all go.
You wanna go, Sam?

26:33.226 --> 26:34.394
Sure.

26:34.427 --> 26:36.062
All right. Ok, Bill?

26:36.096 --> 26:37.130
I guess.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.965
Yeah, I guess so.

26:38.999 --> 26:39.833
All right.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.803

gonna have some fun.

26:43.537 --> 26:44.938
Thanks a lot, Neal.

26:44.971 --> 26:45.872
What?

26:45.906 --> 26:47.440
No one else is gonna
take us there.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.109
It's all the way
out in the boonies.

26:49.142 --> 26:51.311
So, you know I didn't
wanna go with him.

26:51.344 --> 26:54.848
We'll just ditch him
and ride go‐carts
all day.

26:57.483 --> 26:58.952
No way. Absolutely not.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.622
Lindsay, that song
is pornographic.

27:01.655 --> 27:03.724
Dad, come on.
Don't be a prude.

27:03.757 --> 27:06.760
If I was such a prude,
you wouldn't exist.

27:06.793 --> 27:09.663
Fine. Then I'm gonna
be the only kid in
the whole school

27:09.696 --> 27:11.364
who can't go
to a rock concert.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.566
JEAN: All right,
all right.

27:12.599 --> 27:14.100
Maybe we could
chaperone you.

27:14.134 --> 27:16.402
You know, sit behind you,
be real quiet.

27:16.436 --> 27:17.571
It could be fun.

27:17.604 --> 27:19.005
I don't wanna do that.

27:19.039 --> 27:22.609
Dad, look, I understand
your concerns.

27:22.643 --> 27:25.546
I have them myself,
but I...

27:25.579 --> 27:26.847
I wouldn't be
fighting you.

Millie is going.

27:28.982 --> 27:29.850
Millie is?

27:29.883 --> 27:32.218
Yeah. Her parents
said she could go,

27:32.252 --> 27:34.187
and I just sort of
wanted to go
to keep an eye on her.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.624
Oh, honey, you really
are such a good girl,

27:37.658 --> 27:38.892
aren't you?

27:38.925 --> 27:41.662
Yeah. I can
handle myself.

the trophies, whatever.

were into comedy,

a couple of things.

31:40.433 --> 31:41.968
Let's race.

31:42.736 --> 31:44.671
Whoo‐hoo!

31:55.348 --> 31:56.617
Oh, yeah!

31:56.650 --> 31:58.251
Whoo!

32:03.323 --> 32:06.259
No! No! No way!

32:15.702 --> 32:18.338
Come on, buddy!
I got you!

32:36.823 --> 32:38.291
FREDRICKS: Here I come!

32:57.678 --> 32:59.546
Bill, that was
incredible!

32:59.580 --> 33:01.047
Bill, that
was so cool!

33:01.081 --> 33:02.916
You should've
seen yourself
spin out.

33:02.949 --> 33:05.686
The ice cream
is mine.

33:06.452 --> 33:07.754
What is it, Bill?

33:07.788 --> 33:09.355
I hate you!

33:10.323 --> 33:11.658
You what?

33:12.793 --> 33:13.927
You always have to win.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.563
All you care about
is winning.

33:16.597 --> 33:20.266
You don't care at all
about other people's
feelings.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.769
I'm sorry, Bill.
I...

33:39.586 --> 33:40.754
Hey, guys.

33:40.787 --> 33:43.423
Have you
seen Millie?

33:43.456 --> 33:44.691
No.

33:44.725 --> 33:46.459
Ok.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.460
DANIEL: Hey.
Hey.

33:47.493 --> 33:49.229
How do you like
the magic bus?

33:49.262 --> 33:52.398
Wow. It's amazing.
Yeah.

33:52.432 --> 33:54.868
Hey, come back.
I got a Who‐dog
with your name on it.

33:54.901 --> 33:56.102
Ok.

33:57.337 --> 33:58.505
Hey.

33:58.539 --> 33:59.540
Hey.

34:02.042 --> 34:03.209
Have you
seen Millie?

34:03.243 --> 34:04.410
Yeah,
she's right there,

34:04.444 --> 34:06.747
playing Frisbee
with Stroker.

34:06.780 --> 34:08.148
You know,
she's pretty hot.

34:08.181 --> 34:10.551
I like it when
the good girls
cross over.

34:10.584 --> 34:12.553
Shut up.

34:12.586 --> 34:14.220
Keep away from her.

34:14.254 --> 34:17.123
God. Who are you,
her mom?

34:17.157 --> 34:18.391
Hey, Millie.

34:21.995 --> 34:23.263
Millie?

34:24.831 --> 34:26.066
Millie!

34:27.568 --> 34:31.037
MARK: Uh‐oh.
Skinny's in trouble.

34:31.071 --> 34:34.107
Millie. Honey,
I thought we agreed

34:34.140 --> 34:35.776
that you were not going
to go to this concert.

34:35.809 --> 34:37.544
I didn't,
you did.

34:38.344 --> 34:41.047
Well, you're not going.

34:41.081 --> 34:42.549
Yes, I am.

34:43.984 --> 34:45.351
Don't talk back to me.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.487
Mom, this is important
to me.

34:47.521 --> 34:50.323
I'm a straight "A" student.
I never do anything wrong.

34:51.057 --> 34:52.826
Honey,
you're just a kid.

34:52.859 --> 34:54.528
Mom, I'm 15.

34:54.561 --> 34:56.329
You don't know
the kind of things
that could happen.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.931
I can't believe
you can't trust me.

34:57.964 --> 34:59.399
It's not like
I'm gonna drop acid

34:59.432 --> 35:01.467
or have sex
in the parking lot.

35:01.501 --> 35:03.504
Millie!

35:03.537 --> 35:04.871
You...

35:04.905 --> 35:06.106
You get in this car.

35:06.139 --> 35:08.341
I am taking you home
right now.

35:08.374 --> 35:09.375
No.

35:10.176 --> 35:12.646
Just leave me alone.

35:14.615 --> 35:15.882
Fine.

35:15.916 --> 35:19.085
You go right ahead
and do what you
want to do.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.555
Obviously,
you don't care
what I think.

35:27.493 --> 35:29.930
MARK: What a mouth
on that chick!

35:29.963 --> 35:32.666
That's it!
You tell Mama!

35:32.699 --> 35:34.701
Tell her how it is!

35:52.653 --> 35:54.354
I'm sorry, Bill.

35:54.387 --> 35:58.224
I didn't mean
to crash into you.

35:58.258 --> 36:01.562
It's...Wet track today.
I don't know.

36:04.197 --> 36:05.732
We just don't know
each other, do we?

36:05.766 --> 36:08.434
I mean, I thought
we knew each other
in class this year,

36:08.468 --> 36:11.371
but we don't know
each other at all.

36:13.674 --> 36:15.809
But I know what you
think of me.

36:15.842 --> 36:19.412
You think
I'm a stupid jock
gym teacher, right?

36:19.445 --> 36:22.583
Bing! You‐‐you're
probably right.

36:24.450 --> 36:25.819
But I don't know
what to‐‐

36:25.852 --> 36:28.221
I mean,
you know what I am?

36:28.254 --> 36:32.092
I'm a guy who loves
your mother very much.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.895
She's a special woman.
I love her.

36:34.928 --> 36:37.898
You know,
she's had a hard time
the past few years.

36:37.931 --> 36:39.499
What do you
know about it?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.703
Only what she tells me.

36:45.939 --> 36:47.608
But I think she deserves
to be happy,

36:47.641 --> 36:49.676
and, you know,
I can make her happy.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.348
I've never cared
about anybody

36:55.381 --> 36:58.484
as much as I care
about your mom.

36:58.519 --> 37:01.421
I might not be
as bad a guy
as you think I am.

37:33.854 --> 37:35.288
Hey.
Hey.

37:38.391 --> 37:39.926
I'm really glad
that you could come.

37:41.161 --> 37:42.295
Huh? Oh.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.830
Yeah, me, too.

37:43.864 --> 37:45.999
I love The Who.

37:46.032 --> 37:50.370
Pete Townshend's
really been inspiring me
as a songwriter.

37:50.804 --> 37:52.172
Oh, really?

37:52.205 --> 37:53.774
Yeah.

37:54.708 --> 37:56.910
Actually, I wrote
a song for you.

37:57.978 --> 37:59.212
If you
want to hear it...

37:59.245 --> 38:00.547
Yeah.

38:00.581 --> 38:01.715
Yeah.

38:08.822 --> 38:09.990
Check it out!

38:10.023 --> 38:11.558
Whoo! Uh...

38:11.592 --> 38:13.126
Uh, hey,
look at me!

38:13.159 --> 38:15.028
I'm Pete Townshend!

38:15.061 --> 38:17.564
All right, Townshend!
Whoo!

38:20.300 --> 38:23.436
DANIEL: Yeah, man!
Tonight's gonna rock!

38:25.271 --> 38:27.874
MARK: Nice!
Yeah, Ken!

38:27.908 --> 38:30.010
Smash me
a piece of that!

38:32.679 --> 38:34.648
That‐‐he‐‐he's
a crack‐up, right?

38:43.289 --> 38:45.826
Yeaaaaah!

38:45.859 --> 38:48.829
This is the biggest favor
I ever did for you.

38:48.862 --> 38:51.431
NICK: You're buying me
a new guitar, man.

38:53.867 --> 38:54.868
Hey.

38:55.669 --> 38:56.670
You ok?

38:56.703 --> 38:58.772
I've never seen her
like that.

39:00.406 --> 39:02.242
I feel kinda sick.

39:02.275 --> 39:05.345
Hey, who wants a beer?
Anybody?

39:05.378 --> 39:07.948
I'll have
one of those.

39:07.981 --> 39:09.215
Go ahead.
Snag it.

39:09.249 --> 39:10.617
Here you go.
Opener.

39:11.284 --> 39:12.853
Millie,
you don't drink.

39:15.055 --> 39:16.990
Now's a good time
to start.

39:24.397 --> 39:25.732
Bottoms up.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.004
I killed your dog!

39:31.672 --> 39:32.873
What?

39:34.107 --> 39:35.108
Um...

39:36.409 --> 39:38.812
I was the one
that ran him over.

39:40.013 --> 39:42.382
I'm so sorry,
Millie.

39:43.116 --> 39:45.385
That's not very funny.

39:47.353 --> 39:49.623
I'm not kidding,
Millie.

39:50.323 --> 39:51.525
It's true.

39:55.328 --> 39:57.631
Why didn't you
say something?

39:57.664 --> 39:59.733
Why didn't you
tell me?

40:00.767 --> 40:02.168
I don't know.

40:02.202 --> 40:04.971
Well, we didn't know
how to.

40:05.005 --> 40:06.540
Lindsay?

40:08.542 --> 40:10.143
I'm really sorry,
Millie.

40:18.051 --> 40:20.186
She's really mad.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.387
Good.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.156
I'm gonna go
talk to her.

40:25.191 --> 40:27.193
Hey, Kim.

40:27.227 --> 40:28.695
Thanks.

40:36.770 --> 40:39.239
LINDSAY: You know,
I'm glad we didn't go
to that concert.

40:39.272 --> 40:41.107
I hear they're
so noisy, anyway.

40:41.141 --> 40:44.511
Yeah. I hear
that the bathrooms
smell really bad

40:44.545 --> 40:47.380
and that it's
not safe to sit.

40:47.413 --> 40:49.850
Could you imagine
holding it for 4 hours?

40:54.154 --> 40:55.488
Oh!

41:02.062 --> 41:05.431
Look. I found this
in my drawer the other day.

41:05.465 --> 41:08.001
I thought maybe
you might want it.

41:08.034 --> 41:09.202
Wow.

41:10.236 --> 41:11.572
I remember that.

41:11.605 --> 41:12.939
That's the day Goliath

41:12.973 --> 41:15.576
stole all the steaks
off the barbecue
and ate them.

41:16.843 --> 41:17.878
Oh, yeah.

41:18.579 --> 41:21.281
Your dad was so mad.

41:21.314 --> 41:22.649
Yeah.

41:26.252 --> 41:28.989
He was a good dog,
Lindsay.

41:29.623 --> 41:31.725
Yeah,
he was a good dog.

41:38.198 --> 41:40.266
ANNOUNCER: <i>Looks inside,</i>
<i>tries to put the ball</i>

41:40.300 --> 41:42.769
<i>in the corner to Warnsey.</i>
<i>There's nothing there...</i>

42:00.420 --> 42:02.422
Oh, I'm‐‐
I'm sorry, Bill.

42:02.455 --> 42:04.558
Did you want
to watch something?

42:05.592 --> 42:07.628
Dallas is on.

42:15.501 --> 42:17.370
<i>Yes, I'm right</i>
<i>in the middle.</i>

42:17.403 --> 42:18.672
PAM EWING: <i>Well, Bobby‐‐</i>

42:18.705 --> 42:20.741
<i>Wait a minute.</i>
<i>Is it true?</i>

42:22.809 --> 42:24.344
<i>You can do</i>
<i>something about it.</i>

42:24.377 --> 42:25.879
<i>What?</i>

42:25.912 --> 42:27.413
<i>Honey, it's like</i>
<i>J. R. said.</i>

42:27.447 --> 42:28.849
<i>I either vote</i>
<i>for Mama or Daddy,</i>

42:28.882 --> 42:30.250
<i>and either way</i>
<i>I lose.</i>

42:30.283 --> 42:32.653
<i>Well, can't you</i>
<i>just not vote?</i>

42:32.686 --> 42:34.220
<i>Yes, I can abstain,</i>

42:34.254 --> 42:36.456
<i>or I can ask to be excused</i>
<i>from the committee,</i>

42:36.489 --> 42:38.158
<i>but I'm not</i>
<i>gonna do it.</i>

42:38.625 --> 42:40.561
That's Pamela

42:40.594 --> 42:43.964
and Bobby,
J. R.'s brother.

42:46.867 --> 42:47.934
Oh, yeah?

42:48.602 --> 42:49.936
J.R.'s evil,

42:50.937 --> 42:53.273
so Bobby has to
protect Pamela.

42:56.476 --> 42:58.812
What, so‐‐so
Bobby's a good guy?

42:59.345 --> 43:00.981
Yeah.

43:01.014 --> 43:04.150
Yeah, but right now
he's caught in
a Ewing land battle.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.321
What kind of land battle?
With Bobby, or‐‐

43:08.354 --> 43:09.923
Wait‐‐

43:09.956 --> 43:12.225
I'm sorry.

43:14.294 --> 43:16.830
It's ok. I'll tell you
during the commercial.
