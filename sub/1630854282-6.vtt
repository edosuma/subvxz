WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:03.086
CALIAN:
Tom murdered Liam Collins.

00:03.128 --> 00:05.005
I wish you would have
come to me sooner.

00:05.046 --> 00:07.924
I mean, why wouldn't you trust
me with something like this?

00:10.802 --> 00:13.972
I think I know
who killed Liam Collins

00:14.014 --> 00:15.432
and it wasn't Tom.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.519
-Then who?
-The old sheriff,

00:19.561 --> 00:24.691
my mentor, Otis Clay.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.900
Why would a retired sheriff

00:25.942 --> 00:27.318
kill the man
sent to replace him?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.238
Well, what if retirement
wasn't his idea?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.823
Come on, think about it.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.408
We both know what
Otis is capable of

00:33.450 --> 00:35.035
when someone gets in his way.

00:35.076 --> 00:37.579
I mean,
the man is prideful to a fault.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.873
That'd go a long way
towards providing motive.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.212
Besides, from what I gather
from Ruby, it wasn't Griffin.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.259
I should've came to you
sooner with my suspicions.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.511
I'm sorry.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.973
(sniffles) Yeah.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.808
I wish you had.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.520
But I still have

01:02.562 --> 01:04.773
too many unanswered questions
with Otis,

01:04.814 --> 01:07.150
starting with where he was
the night Liam was killed.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.069
And even more damning,

01:09.110 --> 01:12.072
the undertaker
was able to recover a .36.

01:12.113 --> 01:15.116
Otis carries a .36 caliber.

01:15.158 --> 01:16.993
Exactly.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.663
And you know who doesn't?

01:20.705 --> 01:22.207
Tom.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.712
I wonder what Otis
would have to say for himself.

01:29.547 --> 01:33.134
And that's why I think we...

01:33.176 --> 01:35.345
should pay him a visit.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.682
You comin'?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.311
♪ ♪

01:55.990 --> 01:57.909
FRANCIS:
Hoyt!

01:59.327 --> 02:00.954
Ah, damn it.

02:00.995 --> 02:04.332
Francis.
It's good to see you.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.961
How's, uh, how's Lucia doin'?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.298
Visiting her abuelita.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.716
Hadn't seen her
since Founders' Day.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.468
N-Not that I was looking
for any particular reason.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.555
(clears throat) So, how's
everything out at the ranch?

02:18.596 --> 02:22.684
It's been a struggle
since the cattle were stolen.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.311
Cash is tight,
but we'll manage.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.692
I heard about the shootout.
What you did.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.694
The question is, how are you?

02:32.735 --> 02:36.614
Eh. It's just a scratch, really,
you know, a little sore,

02:36.656 --> 02:38.825
you know, a small price to pay

02:38.867 --> 02:40.702
to keep innocent folks
out of harm's way.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.538
When we heard you were shot,
we were worried.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.206
We want you to be
around for a while.

02:46.541 --> 02:47.917
We?

02:49.252 --> 02:51.588
Ah...

02:51.629 --> 02:53.381
I know we're bad
at showing it,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.300
but Anna Maria and I, we...

02:55.341 --> 02:57.969
we always considered you
part of the family.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.808
You know, it was your father's
idea that we settle here.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.437
There was a big oak tree
right over there.

03:08.813 --> 03:10.607
What? That old stump
behind the dentist?

03:10.648 --> 03:11.983
Yeah, they cut it down

03:12.025 --> 03:14.194
so they could build
the Side Step,

03:14.235 --> 03:18.406
but, years ago, it was the
only shade for miles around.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.867
And when your father and I,
we spotted it,

03:20.909 --> 03:23.369
he said, right then and there,

03:23.411 --> 03:25.413
"This is where
we build the future."

03:25.455 --> 03:28.833
You were born in a small cabin
just outside of town.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.586
Even though your father
never saw you grow up,

03:31.628 --> 03:35.131
you're still the firstborn
son of Independence.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.550
Take pride in that, mijo.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.677
Take pride in that.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.638
(Luis speaking in Spanish)

03:41.679 --> 03:43.848
FRANCIS:
Good to see you, Hoyt.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.393
Your father and I,
we were supposed

03:47.435 --> 03:49.646
to run this ranch together.

03:49.687 --> 03:52.899
Maybe there's still a place
for a Rawlins after all.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.110
Come by later. We'll talk
about the future, hmm?

04:01.950 --> 04:03.826
Huh, I'll be damned.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.957
(indistinct chatter)

04:16.130 --> 04:18.925
Ethan, were you gonna tell me
you'd be early?

04:18.967 --> 04:21.803
-And if I had?
-KATE: I would have
thrown you a parade.

04:21.844 --> 04:23.680
Well, your presence
is parade enough.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.723
Well, that's very flattering,

04:25.765 --> 04:27.642
but if I'm not mistaken--
which I rarely am--

04:27.684 --> 04:29.269
we're not supposed to meet
for a few more days.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.979
Yes, that was the plan,

04:31.020 --> 04:33.356
but I heard about
the Eli McDowd debacle

04:33.398 --> 04:35.525
and I got on the first coach
that I could,

04:35.566 --> 04:37.318
just to make sure
you were safe and sound.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.987
As you would for any
other detective in the field.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.489
I wouldn't leave the office
for about half of them.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.741
You know how
I feel about you.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.077
Oh, that's done.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.162
Let's just-- let's stick
to business, shall we?

04:48.204 --> 04:50.623
I can't pretend
that we never happened, Kate.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.208
It's easy.
You should try it.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.668
Now, can I please tell you

04:53.710 --> 04:55.003
about how Tom Davidson
killed Liam Collins?

04:56.879 --> 04:59.215
Of course.
What do you have?

04:59.257 --> 05:02.468
I have a witness.
The wife.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.014
-Oh?
-Mm-hmm.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.849
Will she testify?

05:07.890 --> 05:09.934
Plus evidence to suggest motive.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.978
The Davidsons, they're
buying up land and properties

05:12.020 --> 05:13.813
under all these company
aliases.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.732
And you realize that owning
property is not evidence,

05:15.773 --> 05:17.442
especially for murder.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.193
I would say eyewitness testimony
is, wouldn't you?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.739
Yes, I would,
but only if she testifies.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.491
Otherwise, I need more.
I need something tangible.

05:29.412 --> 05:32.332
Yes, Katherine, I will meet
with your witness tomorrow.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.250
-(pats arm)
-Good man.

05:34.292 --> 05:37.003
You know, I knew you'd listen
to reason eventually.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.423
(short whistle)

05:40.465 --> 05:42.633
-Hi.
-Morning.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.512
So, I have some good news.

05:46.554 --> 05:49.098
Our meeting has been moved up
to tomorrow.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.142
-Tomorrow?
-Hmm.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.894
I thought
we had a few more days.

05:52.935 --> 05:55.772
Well, we did, and then
Ethan arrived early, so...

05:56.898 --> 05:58.983
All right,
where is he?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.027
He's upstairs,
resting up.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.866
Kate Carver, are you
sleeping with your boss?

06:06.908 --> 06:10.745
Listen to me, first of all,
Ethan is not my boss.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.747
He is my handler--
that is a glorified messenger

06:12.789 --> 06:14.540
who couldn't cut it
in the field.

06:14.582 --> 06:18.336
Second of all, what we had--
had, past tense-- was fun

06:18.378 --> 06:20.254
and is not happening anymore.

06:20.296 --> 06:25.051
Now, please, God, enough about
my disintegrated love life.

06:25.093 --> 06:28.137
Um, I know that I don't have
to tell you

06:28.179 --> 06:29.639
that tomorrow
is serious business,

06:29.680 --> 06:31.307
and I've been thinking
we may need more

06:31.349 --> 06:33.142
than a couple of
Davidson shell companies.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.269
I was going to ask you
if you feel comfortable

06:35.311 --> 06:36.979
going against Tom in public?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.191
-Testify?
-Mm-hmm.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.362
It would be
his word against mine.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.447
Well, we need a stronger case.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.449
I thought
that's what Ethan is for.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.951
Doesn't he have the resources

06:49.992 --> 06:51.577
to open up
a real investigation?

06:51.619 --> 06:54.038
Yes, he does, but we still
have to be thorough.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.624
When things like this proceed
without caution,

06:56.666 --> 06:58.334
people-- people get hurt.

06:58.376 --> 07:02.422
And I refuse
to make that mistake.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.843
I will find out what I can.

07:06.884 --> 07:08.636
(door closes)

07:08.678 --> 07:10.638
Oh, well, hiya, sunshine.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.433
What brings you to Hagan's
on this beautiful morning?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.394
Just looking
for Sheriff Davidson.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.440
He's not at the jailhouse.
Have you seen him?

07:20.481 --> 07:22.316
He hasn't left
his new office.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.193
Thank you.

07:25.194 --> 07:26.988
ABBY:
Bye, Kai.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.075
Hi.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.746
He didn't even know
I was here.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.623
I think he likes you.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.375
Yeah, well, what can I say?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.586
I have that effect
on some people.

07:43.921 --> 07:46.466
That's not a heart
I'm willing to break.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.226
(gunshot)

08:08.696 --> 08:11.908
-KAI: Sheriff.
-TOM: Kai.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.452
You wanted to see me?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.246
Is this about the other night
at the restaurant?

08:17.288 --> 08:20.541
I understand you
used to work the railroads.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.085
Did you ever see or speak
to the men in charge?

08:23.127 --> 08:27.048
Never spoke.
Only saw them at the fights.

08:28.549 --> 08:30.551
The fights?

08:30.593 --> 08:34.639
We work long hours.
We were underfed and underpaid.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.390
To earn extra money,

08:36.432 --> 08:37.975
the workers
would fight each other.

08:39.685 --> 08:41.395
Fights.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.735
HOYT:
Aw, hell no.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.196
Tricky son of a bitch!
That's a sacred tree stump!

08:50.238 --> 08:52.657
TOM:
What else can you tell me
about these fights?

08:52.698 --> 08:55.117
KAI: The bosses would dust off
their top hats

08:55.159 --> 08:56.994
and watch.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.955
Place bets.

08:58.996 --> 09:01.290
For us,
it was life or death.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.585
For them,
a source of amusement.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.671
A spectacle.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.591
Did you ever fight?

09:10.633 --> 09:12.093
MAN:
Get your damn hands
off me, Hoyt.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.219
No.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.554
MAN:
I didn't mean nothing by it.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.473
HOYT:
I'm just saying,
have some decency.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.144
Here's your damn hat back.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.896
MAN:
I was just watering!

09:23.938 --> 09:26.190
Thanks for dropping in, Kai.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.705
Hey, boss,
I got a question for you.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.331
Mr. Virgil Green.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.874
Indeed.
Who's asking?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.751
Tom Davidson,

09:45.793 --> 09:47.461
sheriff and proprietor
of this fine establishment.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.505
I'd like to welcome you
to Independence.

09:49.547 --> 09:52.216
My Aunt Teresa told me
you'd be coming through town.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.719
And I must say,
your timing is impeccable.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.304
You've arrived on the occasion

09:56.345 --> 09:58.014
of our town's
inaugural Fight Night.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.682
Would you be interested
in staying?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.934
-I'd be honored.
-Excellent.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.644
I'll put you up
in our best suite,

10:03.686 --> 10:05.479
and consider yourself
a guest of honor.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.190
And if there's anything that
you need, don't hesitate to ask.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.610
-Miss Carver here...
-Hi.

10:10.651 --> 10:12.903
...will handle everything.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.197
Thank you.

10:18.868 --> 10:23.247
CALIAN:
So, what else makes you think
that Otis killed Liam Collins?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.166
A .36 is common enough.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.834
GUS:
You don't find it curious

10:26.876 --> 10:28.878
that he hasn't been
in town since the murder?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.380
He lived in town over
ten years and now he's a ghost.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.257
CALIAN:
Doesn't mean he's guilty.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.759
And that's why
we're going to go

10:34.800 --> 10:36.552
let him tell
his side of the story.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.763
And it shouldn't be
that hard either.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.849
Only thing that man loved more
than the law was talking.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.517
From the news out of Austin

10:43.559 --> 10:45.728
to the latest rash
he found on his person.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.813
(horse neighs)

10:50.483 --> 10:52.943
Not only that, but...

10:52.985 --> 10:55.237
I'm sure
whatever he has to say,

10:55.279 --> 10:56.947
it's been wearing on him.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.116
You may be right.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.411
But I hope for your town's sake,
you're wrong.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.582
(gunshot)

11:06.624 --> 11:08.376
OTIS:
Howdy, boys!

11:08.417 --> 11:11.462
Next time you might want
to announce yourselves.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.838
(laughs)

11:27.019 --> 11:28.646
(Otis chuckles)

11:30.773 --> 11:31.816
Excuse the mess.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.611
Well, we, uh,
we missed you in town.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.488
I was wondering why
you haven't been around.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.532
Oh, you know how it is.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.034
I got things to do.
You get busy.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.663
Besides, I wouldn't want to
step on the new sheriff's boots.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.916
He doesn't need the old guard
looking over his shoulder.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.752
Never mind all that.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.295
My friends are here.

11:53.337 --> 11:55.339
Let's have ourselves a drink.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.717
No, thanks.
We're all right.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.679
What's with you two?

12:01.721 --> 12:03.222
Gus, you on duty or something?

12:03.264 --> 12:06.016
Otis, I think you need
to take a seat.

12:07.476 --> 12:09.186
I got to ask you
some questions.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.450
-On the house.
-Thanks, Kai.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.453
(Kate chuckles)

12:31.208 --> 12:32.293
Mmm.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.837
You really think
you're going to find anything

12:34.879 --> 12:36.172
in that book?

12:36.213 --> 12:37.715
Went over this for weeks
with Liam.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.134
He brought it back after
accepting the offer out here.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.470
I keep thinking
there must be something in here,

12:42.511 --> 12:46.223
some thing he didn't tell me.
Some reason why.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.641
Let me take a look.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.148
Ah, "From one sheriff
to the next."

12:54.190 --> 12:55.691
This was a gift?

12:55.733 --> 12:57.318
From the previous sheriff
of Independence.

12:57.359 --> 12:57.985
Otis Clay.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.197
Liam met with him
to formally accept the job.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.866
But what did you know
about him?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.951
He was a law-and-order type,

13:05.993 --> 13:07.745
the good kind,
I guess you could say, but...

13:08.329 --> 13:10.790
He wasn't too happy
about his early retirement.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.459
He was the last person

13:13.501 --> 13:15.169
Liam spoke to here
before we left Boston.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.962
Maybe he has some information

13:17.004 --> 13:18.839
that would help
our case with Ethan.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.258
Is Otis still around?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.093
He lives a couple miles
out of town.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.095
If you leave now,
you could be back before dark.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.306
Cover for me with Tom?

13:27.348 --> 13:29.308
Sure.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.769
Few things I want to discuss
with His Majesty anyway.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.938
Okay.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.946
You.
You're not seriously

13:41.987 --> 13:43.823
thinking about throwing
a Fight Night here.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.075
I didn't realize I was required
to check with my dancers first.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.286
It is a horrible idea.
Tom Hagan tried it once.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.914
-Disaster.
-Yeah, well, I'm not Hagan.

13:51.956 --> 13:54.542
This I know.
You know, he listens to me

13:54.583 --> 13:55.709
and he learns
from his mistakes,

13:55.751 --> 13:57.294
which Fight Night was one of.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.880
By the way, it cost hundreds
of dollars to repair afterwards,

13:59.922 --> 14:01.674
not to mention the hell that
crowd puts my girls through.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.341
Dancers can have the night off.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.051
Was thinking of bringing
the White Doves in anyway.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.594
But how is it different
for them?

14:05.636 --> 14:07.763
Miss Carver, this is about
more than just making a profit.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.431
I'm doing this for Independence.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.100
I didn't peg you for selfless.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.560
Well, I guess you could write
a new song about me then.

14:12.601 --> 14:13.143
KATE:
I'll pass.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.813
I want to start giving back
to this town

14:15.855 --> 14:17.898
-and I want to do it my way.
-What the hell are you gonna do
about fighters?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.859
Drag a couple of drunks
out of a saloon,

14:19.900 --> 14:21.777
-pit 'em against each other?
-You worry about bringing
that charm and wit

14:21.819 --> 14:23.571
to keep the crowds at bay.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.575
I'll take care of the fighters.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.538
-(door opens)
-Hey!

14:35.583 --> 14:38.460
Exactly what kind of pugilist
did you have in mind, huh?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.755
See it?

14:41.797 --> 14:44.592
That's going to leave one
hell of a scar right there.

14:44.633 --> 14:48.178
Him?
Yeah, good luck.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.848
He'd never risk
messing up his pretty face.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.684
-We'll see about that.
-What?

14:55.311 --> 14:57.104
Course I heard about Griffin.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.690
They say he killed
that young sheriff coming in.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.483
But there are questions
whether or not

15:01.525 --> 15:02.943
we got the right man.

15:03.527 --> 15:07.239
You mean you think
you killed the wrong man.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.034
You want
some help from your old boss?

15:10.075 --> 15:14.079
I see.
Let's get to it then.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.832
So what was
Mr. Collins shot with?

15:16.874 --> 15:19.835
-Believe it was a revolver.
-A .36.

15:27.468 --> 15:30.054
This should work.
Come on.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.230
How do you know it was
a revolver, a .36 no less?

15:40.272 --> 15:42.191
The powder burn on his shirt.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.151
Figured it happened
pretty close.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.569
Easy shot.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.154
Any chance
he had an accomplice?

15:47.196 --> 15:47.863
Possibly.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.866
Another set of prints
were found at the campsite.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.451
How'd you find the body?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.954
Moved.
Buried in a shallow grave.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.874
That is curious.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.086
As is burying a man
murdered in cold blood.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.380
Any idea
when this all happened?

16:04.421 --> 16:07.341
He was supposed to arrive
in Independence that Sunday.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.426
Between the train
and their wagon party,

16:09.468 --> 16:11.470
I figure
somewhere around the first.

16:11.512 --> 16:15.933
Lot of rain the week before.
Cloudy, not a lot of stars.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.103
Wouldn't even see him coming.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.563
Remember
our first case together?

16:21.605 --> 16:24.316
Llewelyn boy who disappeared
down that well?

16:24.358 --> 16:26.819
If it wasn't for you
finding him, Cal...

16:26.860 --> 16:29.363
Damn lucky to have
you two by my side.

16:29.405 --> 16:31.407
(chuckles)

16:31.448 --> 16:33.325
Still can't believe
how y'all met.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.868
Buffalo soldier
on one side,

16:34.910 --> 16:37.287
driving out an Apache
on the other.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.832
Could have killed each other,
but you didn't.

16:39.873 --> 16:41.667
He was shot.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.711
Didn't seem like
he was in a rush to get back.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.129
It would have made more sense

16:45.170 --> 16:47.089
to stick with Calian
and his people

16:47.131 --> 16:49.800
than go to a man who didn't
care about either of us.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.262
It's a hard world.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.639
Not easy to make
the right choices sometimes.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.892
Thankful you two did.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.354
I made the wrong decision
with you, though, didn't I, Gus?

17:03.564 --> 17:05.107
What's that about?

17:05.149 --> 17:07.401
I should have had you take
my place when I left.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.696
But it wasn't all up to me,

17:10.738 --> 17:12.865
but I'll tell you this.

17:14.158 --> 17:16.952
I wish to hell
it wasn't that Tom Davidson

17:16.994 --> 17:19.788
or that son of a bitch
Liam Collins.

17:19.830 --> 17:23.542
Half of me thinks
it's not so bad he's dead.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.252
Put him out of his misery.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.384
(hoofbeats approach)

17:33.802 --> 17:36.638
Well,
who the hell's this now?

17:45.981 --> 17:48.192
Otis, this is Abigail Walker.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.902
New law clerk
Tom brought in for help.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.320
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Clay.

17:51.361 --> 17:54.156
Please.
Call me Otis.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.741
(sighs)

17:55.783 --> 17:58.368
Why don't we go back inside
so we can talk some more?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.831
What are you doing here?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.958
I wanted to speak
to the old sheriff.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.586
It's not a good time.
Augustus believes

18:07.628 --> 18:09.588
he has something to do
with Liam's murder,

18:09.630 --> 18:12.382
as an accomplice, maybe more.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.176
ABBY:
I don't know about that,
but I do know

18:14.218 --> 18:16.678
he met with Liam before
accepting the job out here.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.806
Abby, you should go.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.893
No.
I'm the law clerk after all.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.937
Someone has to take
his account.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.485
So, just picture it.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.279
The Winning Spirit
of Independence.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.866
Sounds like something
that more suits a horse.

18:37.908 --> 18:40.702
-Why me?
-I've seen you in action.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.705
Easily quickest draw
in the town.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.375
I can only imagine what
you can do with those fists.

18:46.416 --> 18:49.002
Or I could ask that tracker
friend Calian of yours

18:49.044 --> 18:50.462
if you'd like.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.714
No, I'm not saying
I couldn't be persuaded.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.384
I just need to know
what's in it for me.

18:55.425 --> 18:59.763
Town hero isn't enough, huh?
I can understand that.

19:00.764 --> 19:02.516
All right.
What'd you have in mind?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.768
That's a good question.
I don't know.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.856
Month of free drinks at Hagan's?

19:08.897 --> 19:12.484
Tell your deputy to lay off
with his baseless accusations.

19:12.526 --> 19:15.070
Week's worth of beer.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.364
And I'll talk
to Augustus for you.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.329
The thing is...
a man willing to put himself

19:24.371 --> 19:28.375
in harm's way could use a
little padding in his pockets.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.878
Assuming bets can be placed.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.006
That wouldn't be illegal,
right?

19:34.047 --> 19:36.758
I don't see an issue
with a few small wagers.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.844
-Deal.
-Deal.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.679
Who am I gonna be fighting?

19:40.721 --> 19:42.598
Someone from out of town.
From Brenham.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.309
Think of it as a chance
to give Independence a win.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.648
I also want tonight
to make a lasting impression.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.401
Well, that's
a Hoyt Rawlins specialty.

19:56.486 --> 19:58.780
Why don't you just say what
you're getting at, Augustus?

19:58.822 --> 20:01.074
You think I was involved
in Liam Collins' murder.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.868
-That it?
-Otis, listen...

20:02.910 --> 20:04.912
What the hell is this?
I didn't pull that damn trigger.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.539
-Just tell us why you stepped
down as sheriff.
-I retired.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.458
I don't need to explain
myself to you.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.628
Did you ever meet
with Liam Collins?

20:12.669 --> 20:14.796
Once. Months back.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.299
He wanted to get out of Boston
in a hurry.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.884
Did he say why?

20:18.926 --> 20:21.929
No, but I have some ideas.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.181
Was he running
from someone in Boston?

20:24.223 --> 20:26.391
Or did someone want him
out here, or...?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.809
Thought crossed my mind, too.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.770
Felt like someone
was pulling the strings.

20:29.811 --> 20:33.148
-Who?
-Hell. You don't think
those Davidsons

20:33.190 --> 20:35.609
-know how to throw
their money around?
-The Davidsons?

20:35.651 --> 20:38.028
Yeah, and anyone else
with more money than sense.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.822
The rest of us just have
to go along to get along.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.950
Look at me,
for Pete's sake.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.451
Wait, wait, wait, I thought
you said you wanted to retire.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.912
I never said I wanted to.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.623
I was forced out!
All right?

20:51.375 --> 20:53.126
Didn't think you'd understand.

20:54.419 --> 20:58.507
I was offered money
and I took it.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.218
By who?

21:02.803 --> 21:07.224
Got word from the judge,
cash and a land offer.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.309
Judge Carter?

21:09.351 --> 21:11.687
Nah, some other circuit judge.

21:11.728 --> 21:13.272
I don't remember.

21:15.315 --> 21:18.277
I loved my job.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.196
Now, way I see it,
newcomer taking your job

21:21.238 --> 21:23.615
seems like an awful good reason
to put him down.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.536
You think
I'd kill a man for that?

21:27.577 --> 21:29.663
Well, if you didn't,
then who did?

21:29.705 --> 21:31.415
OTIS:
I don't know.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.042
Collins was clearly
running from something.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.711
Looking over his shoulder.

21:35.752 --> 21:37.546
Thought there was
someone following them.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.258
-Them?
-He had a wife.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.846
Far as I know,
they never found her, did they?

21:48.682 --> 21:50.892
Look, did you ever meet
with Tom Davidson

21:50.934 --> 21:52.894
prior to him
being named sheriff?

21:52.936 --> 21:54.855
Hell no.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.857
Son of a bitch
just took my job.

21:56.898 --> 21:59.609
Didn't even have the decency
to come and shake my hand.

21:59.651 --> 22:04.156
And you ask why
I haven't been back to town.

22:05.615 --> 22:09.244
My succession had been handled.

22:09.286 --> 22:10.829
Without me.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.001
I'm sorry, Augustus.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.463
CALIAN:
You still haven't answered
where you were that night,

22:19.504 --> 22:21.423
the night Liam Collins
was murdered.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.050
OTIS:
With Francis Reyes.

22:23.091 --> 22:25.969
He asked for some help
on a cattle drive

22:26.011 --> 22:28.764
on the night in question.

22:28.805 --> 22:30.932
And Francis
will attest to that?

22:30.974 --> 22:33.935
I'm getting fed up
with the accusations.

22:33.977 --> 22:37.064
