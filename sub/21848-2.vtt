40:22.253 --> 40:24.189
Everything went great.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.024
Thank you. Thank you.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.093
Thank you.
There were
complications --

40:28.126 --> 40:30.929
But I'm okay?
Yeah, but the surgery --

40:30.962 --> 40:32.063
I don't care.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.733
You saved me. Thank you.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.535
My son's
going to be here soon.

40:36.568 --> 40:38.169
I told him
you said it would be okay,

40:38.203 --> 40:40.071
but he flew in anyway.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.941
You saved me.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.213
You're gonna be a beautiful
mother of the groom.

41:13.705 --> 41:15.173
Go on and take a bow.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.975
You've earned it.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.911
Why does it matter
who gets credit?

41:19.945 --> 41:24.082
It matters because
the people who get credit,

41:24.115 --> 41:25.951
they don't have to do
scut work.

Jerry: Dr. Murphy,

* I'd take care of you

41:56.682 --> 42:00.752
* If you'd ask me to

42:02.988 --> 42:10.596
* In a year or two

42:10.629 --> 42:12.063
* Oh, oh, oh
