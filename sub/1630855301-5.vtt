WEBVTT

02:32.361 --> 02:34.655
It's okay, Danny.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.575
This is going to be a process.

02:42.037 --> 02:45.290
How about we go further back? Okay?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.049
How about we talk about...

02:56.969 --> 02:58.762
you, when you were a little boy.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.016
What about it?

03:03.016 --> 03:07.104
Well, can you tell me
about the good times?

03:08.272 --> 03:09.940
Can you tell me a happy memory?

03:13.068 --> 03:18.323
"Fourteen, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19."

03:18.991 --> 03:20.742
We struck out 19 times.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.245
- And won.
- Amazing.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.830
Swoboda hit two homers.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.374
But the Cubs won too.

03:27.374 --> 03:32.212
Stop worrying about the Cubs.
I'm telling you, Dan, this is our year.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.508
I can hear you in there.
What part of "bedtime" wasn't clear?

03:38.510 --> 03:40.470
You think that they have
channel nine in London?

03:40.470 --> 03:41.555
I don't know.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.849
London's pretty far.

03:45.851 --> 03:49.104
You cheer 'em on while I'm gone.
They need it.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.522
Cleon.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.234
- Jones steps to the plate.
- Cleon.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.404
- Jenkins deliver.
- Cleon.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.781
A swing and a miss! He struck 'em out.

03:59.781 --> 04:00.866
What?

04:00.866 --> 04:04.703
Mets lose 'cause Danny Sullivan
didn't cheer loud enough.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.207
I'll cheer, okay? I'll cheer.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.001
Dad's picking me up pretty early.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.382
I wish you didn't have to go.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.345
I'll be saying the same thing to you
come Christmas.

04:21.345 --> 04:24.181
You'll be just fine. Good night, Danny.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.350
Good night, Adam.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.028
<i>You were twins, right?</i>

04:40.239 --> 04:42.282
My mom used to say that
we were joined at the hip.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.743
And it was true.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.411
When was this?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.873
We were in grade school, my brother and I.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.878
It was summer, the tail end.
You know, when school's back.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.506
And that was the first time
you two had been apart?

04:58.715 --> 04:59.800
Yeah.

05:02.052 --> 05:05.138
<i>The thing is, is Adam was the one
who always had my back.</i>

05:22.698 --> 05:23.907
Come on in.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.010
Hey, man.

05:43.677 --> 05:44.887
Hey, Bill.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.263
Should we get some?

05:46.263 --> 05:48.932
Sure. I mean, I guess.

05:50.893 --> 05:53.896
I forgot my money. Do you have any on you?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.152
Wow.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.905
I get my allowance today
for the whole week.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.156
We could get change.

06:04.823 --> 06:05.908
I'll pay you back.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.292
Just use ten cents, okay?

06:15.292 --> 06:17.669
Don't worry.
Like I said, I'll pay you back.

06:26.553 --> 06:27.596
Pick a hand, Danny.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.190
Payback.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.752
We tried to reach your mother,
but we keep getting no answer.

06:59.253 --> 07:03.215
The machine's broken.
She says it's not worth fixing.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.217
She works afternoons at the hospital.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.302
And since your dad, well, he...

07:10.347 --> 07:11.723
That's why Mr. Jones is here.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.812
Mr. Jones is our guidance counselor
for elementary school.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.565
Now, this is not an ideal way
to start off.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.859
Now, clearly,
what Mr. Carter did was not acceptable,

07:21.859 --> 07:23.735
but neither is throwing
a tantrum like that.

07:23.735 --> 07:24.820
It's okay.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.451
Do you have something you want to say,
Danny?

07:33.370 --> 07:34.413
Can I go home?

07:34.413 --> 07:38.375
Of course. Of course you can.
You and I can meet once a week.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.009
Give this to your mother.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.636
Don't slam the screen.

08:30.636 --> 08:31.929
Sorry, Mom.

08:33.554 --> 08:34.806
Happy Friday.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.059
How was my big boy's
first full week of third grade?

08:38.559 --> 08:39.394
Fine.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.188
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, Mom.

08:50.822 --> 08:51.990
Let me see that smile.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.256
They're moving out
of the bed-and-breakfast.

09:07.965 --> 09:09.675
Yeah, baby, it's closing up.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.885
Who's gonna live there now?

09:13.637 --> 09:16.598
I don't know. Ghosts, maybe.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.436
Made you PB and J.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.025
- Can't you stay home?
- Sorry, baby.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.153
We only got my paychecks
putting food on the table.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.239
And I gotta go get dressed for work.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.614
Can't you not go tonight?

10:15.032 --> 10:16.450
You know I gotta work, baby.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.744
I don't like staying here alone.

10:23.081 --> 10:26.418
You'll be perfectly fine. You miss Adam?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.045
It's not fair.

10:28.629 --> 10:29.880
Send me to Dad's.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.262
You got the list of numbers.
You call me if you get scared.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.057
Let me come with you.

10:40.057 --> 10:41.141
You know you can't.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.019
Just this one time.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.772
Please. I'm begging you.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.734
Please, Mom.

11:26.270 --> 11:27.104
Please, Mom.

11:30.274 --> 11:31.400
Okay.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.696
- God. You choose.
- Good.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.577
And I choose this.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.871
No. Too hot.

11:51.461 --> 11:52.671
This one.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.721
You like it?

12:00.721 --> 12:02.264
<i>I spoke with your mom.</i>

12:04.975 --> 12:07.519
What? We-- You spoke to my mom?

12:09.855 --> 12:11.398
Is she okay? How is she?

12:11.398 --> 12:13.567
She's okay. Yeah, she's okay.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.612
She says she wants to come see you.

12:17.196 --> 12:18.655
- Really?
- Really.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.197
- What was that?
- Nothing.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.461
Thought you fell into a well.

13:14.461 --> 13:18.507
Your shift starts at--
Oh, no. Uh-uh. No way.

13:18.507 --> 13:21.301
Kid can't come in here. It's state law.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.886
- Color.
- I could get shut down.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.429
- But Mario said--
- I know. Let me handle it.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.390
We've been over this. Candy, I'm serious.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.308
Count to ten Mississippi,
and then put your song on.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.560
You know which one, right?

13:32.312 --> 13:35.023
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi...

13:35.023 --> 13:38.068
- Hey, it's a onetime thing.
- Every time is a onetime thing.

13:38.068 --> 13:40.696
...four Mississippi, five Mississippi,
six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,

13:40.696 --> 13:44.157
I'm sorry that Pete turned out to be
the same asshole he always was.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.493
...eight Mississippi, nine Mississippi, ten.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.210
They come in here
and see a kid eating in the bar and--

13:55.210 --> 13:57.671
It's double illegal if he's sitting at it.

14:03.177 --> 14:04.636
Come on, Candy.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.181
What? I shouldn't let the kid
play the jukebox now?

14:07.181 --> 14:09.683
It's not my fault
you guys got the same favorite song.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.352
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.687
Takes one to know one.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.316
- How you doing, Dan?
- Hi, Mario.

14:19.735 --> 14:23.405
Get him a Coke and a burger or something.
Kid's thin as a reed.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.949
- Last time. I promise.
- Sure.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.487
Thanks, but that was--
Watch your step, girl.

15:03.487 --> 15:04.738
Sorry.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.302
How y'all doing?

15:28.554 --> 15:29.930
What can I get you folks?

15:29.930 --> 15:31.890
Couple of pitchers of Bud, please, ma'am.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.523
Hey, little man. What you got there?

15:39.523 --> 15:40.691
Coloring book.

15:41.859 --> 15:45.070
Dinosaurs. Cool.

15:46.238 --> 15:49.116
You ever get down to the
Museum of Natural History?

15:50.075 --> 15:53.161
Yeah. Fourth floor, all dinosaurs.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.663
Yeah. They have that--

15:54.663 --> 15:59.168
that big mural with
the pterodactyls on it. Yours is better.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.546
Excuse me. You're sitting on my shirt.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.089
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.633
Hey there. Hey. Hi.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.720
Where y'all from?

16:09.720 --> 16:12.306
- We're just having a beer.
- That so?

16:12.306 --> 16:13.682
Yeah.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.479
Yeah. Look, man.
We don't want any trouble, okay?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.564
That so?

16:24.401 --> 16:25.819
Danny, come on over here please.

16:26.403 --> 16:27.821
You best listen to your mama, son.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.200
Nobody told you you could talk to him.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.784
Nobody told me I had to ask permission.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.331
You niggers is hardheaded.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.923
I got you. Just breathe, okay?

16:47.966 --> 16:50.594
Sometimes I think
the blood that night marked me.

16:50.594 --> 16:51.678
What do you mean?

16:52.304 --> 16:54.723
Well, from ancient Judaism
to Shakespeare, blood,

16:54.723 --> 16:58.393
especially blood spilled in violence,
has magical powers.

16:59.561 --> 17:03.690
It can ward off evil,
or it can even summon it.

17:08.278 --> 17:12.115
Is that what you think?
That what happened to you is your fault?

17:13.825 --> 17:15.868
Well, everything that came afterwards

17:16.619 --> 17:18.997
couldn't possibly
just be a coincidence, could it?

17:33.679 --> 17:34.763
Hey, baby.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.016
Why aren't you asleep?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.893
I can't stop thinking about the fight.

17:39.893 --> 17:42.980
I'm sorry. You wanna sleep in my bed?

17:50.779 --> 17:52.155
But just tonight, okay?

17:56.785 --> 17:57.828
Come here.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.293
<i>The thing is,
is Dad going left us vulnerable.</i>

18:06.086 --> 18:07.838
My mom was perpetually disappointed.

18:07.838 --> 18:11.925
I mean, always thinking that she wanted
someone to fix things

18:11.925 --> 18:14.553
or help make life turn out
the way she'd expected.

18:18.140 --> 18:19.391
We needed a savior.

18:42.456 --> 18:43.457
Hello.

18:53.550 --> 18:58.222
Hey. I'm Marlin. You know, like the fish.

18:59.556 --> 19:00.641
Sit down. Go on.

19:00.641 --> 19:01.767
We're good, Joe.

19:03.227 --> 19:06.813
Seriously, I don't bite, Christopher.

19:08.232 --> 19:09.233
Go on.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.113
Coffee?

19:16.698 --> 19:18.116
- For real?
- Yeah.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.494
- Sure.
- Okay.

19:21.912 --> 19:22.913
Milk and sugar?

19:23.497 --> 19:26.708
Nah, just sugar. Strong and black like me.

19:27.793 --> 19:28.794
Okay.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.005
So, I'm senior counselor here,

19:32.005 --> 19:34.091
and I'm gonna manage your intake.

19:34.091 --> 19:37.094
Now, the first thing I'm gonna tell you
is that you can trust me.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.014
I know you think that's bullshit,
and that's okay.

19:41.807 --> 19:44.226
Anything you managed to hide
and didn't surrender,

19:44.226 --> 19:46.979
you can give it to me now.
No consequences.

19:47.771 --> 19:52.192
They find it on you after you leave
this room, can't make any promises.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.278
Nah, man. I ain't got nothing.

19:54.778 --> 19:55.779
Okay.

19:57.531 --> 19:58.824
Breaking and entering.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.660
Yeah, man.
My grandma locked me out the house,

20:02.578 --> 20:04.538
and I was supposed to be staying with her.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.750
How you gonna arrest me
for breaking into my own house?

20:11.587 --> 20:12.838
That's a good point.

20:15.507 --> 20:20.846
Wow. Your birthday was yesterday?
You made juvie by a day.

20:20.846 --> 20:22.306
Nah, I don't need no juvie none.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.775
So here's the thing, Christopher Forbes.

20:33.775 --> 20:39.114
You can try and sound all hard,
but it's rough in here.

20:40.115 --> 20:44.119
And you look a lot younger than you are,
and you're too small.

20:44.703 --> 20:45.913
And in here...

20:47.706 --> 20:49.708
too small gets tested just like too big.

20:51.835 --> 20:55.172
So you're gonna need a friend.
I can be that friend.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.883
I can watch out for you.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.094
Nah, man, I'm good.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.350
Yeah. Whatever you say, kid.
Look, follow the rules.

21:06.350 --> 21:10.062
Don't get... pulled into shit you can avoid.

21:11.480 --> 21:14.316
And you and me,
we'll make sure you do your six months

21:14.316 --> 21:17.986
and get you outta here in,
hopefully, one piece.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.740
- You got me?
- I got you.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.784
Say, "I got you, Marlin."

21:24.409 --> 21:26.286
- I got you, Marlin.
- Okay.

21:27.371 --> 21:28.205
All done, Joe.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.916
I got the ribs. Give me a second.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.547
Don't even worry about it.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.427
You know what, Joe?
Sorry, one more thing I've gotta ask him.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.929
Hold on one sec. Sorry.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.475
What's up?

21:59.778 --> 22:01.488
Guy from my block taught me that.

22:02.239 --> 22:05.909
And that thing that you said about
watching out--

22:06.410 --> 22:08.370
Not that I need it or anything.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.372
- No. Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:16.003 --> 22:17.421
We're good, Joe.

23:16.688 --> 23:17.898
How you doing?

23:21.026 --> 23:24.696
Passed this place a hundred times,
never came in.

23:26.865 --> 23:28.116
Why today?

23:29.743 --> 23:33.914
I guess I decided to take
your sign as a sign.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.670
- Can I get you something?
- Yeah, why not?

23:42.172 --> 23:45.300
I'll take a beer.
Miller, if you got it on tap.

23:45.843 --> 23:47.302
- That we do.
- Thanks.

23:51.557 --> 23:53.141
You care to join me?

24:18.584 --> 24:20.043
Am I drinking alone?

24:30.679 --> 24:34.391
You don't really know any
of that happened though. Not really.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.896
No, not exactly. But there's a difference.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.063
How so?

24:40.063 --> 24:42.482
Well, there are things
that you know because you've lived them.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.942
Things you know because you've read them.

24:43.942 --> 24:46.153
But there are some things you know
because you've been told

24:46.153 --> 24:47.529
the story a thousand times.

24:48.197 --> 24:50.866
You know them as well as
if you lived them yourself.

24:50.866 --> 24:52.409
Your mother, she told you?

24:52.409 --> 24:53.660
They both did.

24:55.412 --> 25:00.501
All the time when we were growing up.
They told Adam and me.

25:02.336 --> 25:03.629
So, what happened then?

25:05.297 --> 25:09.301
They talked and talked all night
until my mom's shift was over.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.679
<i>Whatever they said exactly, I don't know.</i>

25:12.679 --> 25:15.974
<i>But it's what people say
when they fall in love.</i>

26:15.826 --> 26:18.328
<i>I guess my mom hoped
that Marlin would save us.</i>

26:19.329 --> 26:21.915
That he could be someone
who could keep the monsters out.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.670
And I guess she thought
that Marlin was the guy for the job.

26:27.546 --> 26:29.214
I mean, I guess we both did.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.259
But?

26:34.386 --> 26:37.097
But the truth is,
is that we didn't stand a chance.

26:39.016 --> 26:40.893
The monsters were already there.

27:21.016 --> 27:22.476
Boy, you get 'em!

28:45.309 --> 28:46.560
You make breakfast every day?

28:50.355 --> 28:52.399
- Good morning, sir.
- Look who's up early.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.526
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:54.526 --> 28:56.111
Come on, let's have some breakfast.

28:56.111 --> 28:58.864
- Do you wanna sit down?
- No. Don't wanna be late.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.991
- Adam's back today.
- Have a good day, young man.

29:02.075 --> 29:03.744
Hey, your lunch box.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.126
And don't forget your jacket.

29:26.725 --> 29:31.063
Danny, wait up! Hold the doors!

29:38.403 --> 29:41.073
- Hey.
- How was Dad's?

29:41.073 --> 29:43.575
- It was okay.
- Mom had a guy over.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.912
Dad asked about you a bunch of times.

29:46.912 --> 29:47.996
He really misses you.

29:50.666 --> 29:51.959
He's going to London again.

29:52.584 --> 29:55.003
He said when he gets back,
he's gonna ask Mom if he can come over.

29:55.796 --> 29:57.089
She's only gonna say no.

29:57.089 --> 30:00.175
Yeah, but you know Dad, he'll keep asking.

30:00.676 --> 30:03.762
I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't just
come over and kidnap you.

30:03.762 --> 30:07.182
- I wish.
- Danny, heard you got beat up by a girl.

30:07.182 --> 30:08.976
Hear you choked on your own cock.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.444
I really miss him.

30:20.696 --> 30:24.533
Like I said,
Adam always had my back, you know?

30:28.328 --> 30:30.747
<i>My dad travels a lot,</i>

30:30.747 --> 30:32.916
which is why we don't really
get to see him.

30:34.001 --> 30:39.131
And he's--
His company's opening an office in London.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.926
He's gonna have an apartment there now.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.763
That's why he got me this.

30:49.808 --> 30:52.603
So when my dad's work
gets settled at the travel agency,

30:52.603 --> 30:54.813
we're gonna go visit
all the places in the book.

30:56.023 --> 30:59.526
Like it says on the cover, A to Z.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.626
Thank you, Danny. That was very good.

31:18.337 --> 31:19.713
Teacher's pet.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.175
That's enough.

31:25.219 --> 31:26.887
Sarah. Thank you.

31:26.887 --> 31:28.639
Thank you.

31:29.181 --> 31:30.766
Thank you.

31:31.975 --> 31:33.018
Thank you.

31:33.685 --> 31:35.562
Dan, could you hold back for a minute?

31:36.063 --> 31:37.105
Thank you.

31:37.940 --> 31:39.858
Thank you so very much.

31:40.817 --> 31:41.860
Thank you.

31:50.869 --> 31:52.079
Come on.

31:56.250 --> 31:57.292
Take a load off.

32:08.595 --> 32:09.847
You're a sweet kid, Danny.

32:12.474 --> 32:15.519
Sensitive... I can tell that.

32:16.854 --> 32:18.021
Wouldn't you say that's true?

32:21.441 --> 32:24.570
I guess. I don't know.

32:24.570 --> 32:25.696
I think you are.

32:26.530 --> 32:31.159
I think you feel things deeply.
Very deeply.

32:32.452 --> 32:36.498
Your dad's not around, huh, Dan?
And your mom, she works a lot.

32:36.498 --> 32:39.960
Two jobs.
Seems to me like you need a friend.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.714
Someone to talk to.
Someone that thinks you're special.

32:46.049 --> 32:47.259
I see you, Dan.

32:48.760 --> 32:53.265
I think you're special.
You don't have to feel so alone.

32:54.850 --> 32:58.729
I don't wanna hurt you, son.
I wanna help you.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.524
If something's bothering you,
you promise--

33:09.448 --> 33:10.741
What's going on here exactly?

33:13.327 --> 33:14.369
Just talking.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.331
Boy's mom asked me to pick him up.

33:18.207 --> 33:19.291
Let's go, Dan.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.683
He seemed just like
what the doctor ordered.

33:37.184 --> 33:38.143
It's funny, right?

33:39.520 --> 33:40.771
Not really, no.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.066
No, I guess not.

33:45.984 --> 33:47.194
<i>What'd you say?</i>

33:48.570 --> 33:50.239
They need to mow their grass,
don't you think?

33:50.239 --> 33:51.448
Do you mow lawns?

33:52.157 --> 33:53.367
No? You want to?

33:53.367 --> 33:55.369
Want me to carry that? Okay.

33:56.286 --> 33:57.496
Come on.

34:00.749 --> 34:01.750
Up you go.

34:07.464 --> 34:09.007
I got worried when you didn't come out.

34:12.594 --> 34:13.804
Okay.

34:19.935 --> 34:21.687
Okay, here we go.

34:24.523 --> 34:25.357
All right.

34:49.547 --> 34:50.716
You okay, Dan?

34:52.717 --> 34:53.719
Yeah?

34:58.724 --> 35:00.184
What were you doing back there?

35:02.853 --> 35:03.854
Nothing.

35:05.772 --> 35:06.773
Did he touch you?

35:11.320 --> 35:12.529
You can tell me.

35:21.538 --> 35:26.293
So, I'm thinking of proposing to your mom.

35:28.462 --> 35:30.005
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:30.005 --> 35:31.381
I think she'd like that.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.136
Don't you think? Yeah?

35:36.845 --> 35:40.224
Truth is she's having trouble
making ends meet.

35:42.893 --> 35:44.895
She's having trouble, what with both jobs.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.190
Real truth is,

35:50.150 --> 35:54.238
I'm not even sure
how she could keep you, you know?

35:58.325 --> 36:00.869
I'd be willing to help her out.

36:02.204 --> 36:07.376
But... we gotta make a pact.

36:10.629 --> 36:13.507
You know, like a secret.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.009
Think we can do that?

36:17.427 --> 36:19.054
- Sure.
- Yeah?

36:42.870 --> 36:44.037
Can I stop now?

36:47.749 --> 36:48.959
It's--

36:49.751 --> 36:54.631
It's really important
that you try to continue.

36:57.009 --> 36:58.844
And we can stop at any time.

37:00.971 --> 37:04.016
But it's important that you try.

37:08.061 --> 37:09.813
We're gonna do something.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.941
And you're gonna like it.

37:18.363 --> 37:19.990
And it's gonna be our secret.

37:24.703 --> 37:25.829
Come on.

37:32.961 --> 37:34.087
Come on.

37:45.307 --> 37:46.141
Don't.

38:01.365 --> 38:02.533
Come on. Over here.

38:05.077 --> 38:07.621
I just wanna show you something. Come on.

38:17.548 --> 38:18.799
Come on.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.873
Hey, you don't wanna
upset your mom, do ya?

38:53.125 --> 38:55.460
I want you to look at me.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.964
Hey, none of that.

39:03.844 --> 39:04.928
Be a good boy.

39:05.429 --> 39:08.182
Now, come on. I wanna--
Just want to show you something.

39:10.434 --> 39:11.435
Come on.

39:17.232 --> 39:21.320
I wanna see what's in the barn.
Take me instead. I won't tell Mom.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.447
None of that bullshit!

39:32.664 --> 39:33.999
It's okay, Dan.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.709
Okay, come on.

39:52.518 --> 39:54.895
<i>How long after did he marry your mom?</i>

39:55.521 --> 39:58.106
<i>Was a few months. That winter.</i>

39:58.649 --> 39:59.858
<i>And he kept it up?</i>

40:01.276 --> 40:02.277
Why stop?

40:06.156 --> 40:07.199
And your mom?

40:09.618 --> 40:10.619
She never knew.

40:11.495 --> 40:12.663
And it was always Adam?

40:13.580 --> 40:14.665
Every time.

40:16.792 --> 40:17.960
He was my savior.

40:21.380 --> 40:22.798
So what happened to him?

40:24.132 --> 40:25.259
How did he die?

40:36.103 --> 40:38.105
What has any of this
got to do with Ariana?

40:40.190 --> 40:44.152
I thought that we were here to talk
about Ariana and Rockefeller Center.
