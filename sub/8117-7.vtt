WEBVTT

00:35.536 --> 00:37.771
All right.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.640
Let's catch some dinner.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.946
I was kind of surprised
that you suggested this trip.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.381
Well...

00:49.049 --> 00:50.918
every man needs a hobby.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.320
When did you pick it up?

00:52.353 --> 00:56.056
Well, when I got to Terra Nova,

00:56.090 --> 00:59.760
fish were the only thing I could
hunt that didn't hunt me back.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.697
This place must be
full of fun memories.

01:03.731 --> 01:07.000
Actually...

01:07.034 --> 01:09.537
sometimes I kind
of miss those days.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.771
One time,

01:10.804 --> 01:12.506
I brought my son out here.

01:12.540 --> 01:16.009
Well, I strong-armed him
into coming.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.446
That didn't work out
too good.

01:18.479 --> 01:22.316
It's the first time I ever
heard you talk about Lucas.

01:22.350 --> 01:25.353
So, how long has it been
since he went missing?

01:26.854 --> 01:29.423
That's not
my favorite topic.

01:30.891 --> 01:31.959
Come on.

01:31.992 --> 01:34.395
Oh! Oh, yeah,
I got something.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.696
Set it!
Like this?

01:35.729 --> 01:36.697
There you go.

01:36.730 --> 01:37.798
What now?

01:37.831 --> 01:39.867
Reel the bastard in.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.101
Come on!

01:41.135 --> 01:43.103
Come on, baby!

01:43.137 --> 01:44.705
Oh, yeah.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.040
Come on.
Yeah, Mama!

01:47.074 --> 01:49.577
Higher, Jim.

01:49.610 --> 01:50.711
Come on!

02:03.191 --> 02:04.525
Whew! Fun hobby.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.859
Yeah.

02:09.997 --> 02:12.366
Hey, guys.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.601
Hey.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.002
Don't mind me.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.770
I'm only home for a minute.

02:16.804 --> 02:19.740
I have seven reentry work-ups
to do this afternoon.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.577
You know, the team...
They've been away in the wild

02:23.611 --> 02:25.879
for about, what, six months now?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.582
That's a long time.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.585
The leader
is some guy named, um...

02:31.619 --> 02:34.588
What is again now?
It's, um,

02:34.622 --> 02:35.889
Ken Horton?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.526
Ken Horton? He's back?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.262
Who's Ken Horton?

02:41.295 --> 02:42.530
He's a geologist.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.097
He's like Marco Polo, Darwin

02:44.131 --> 02:46.133
and Shackleton all
rolled in one.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.701
Here...

02:49.102 --> 02:52.373
Atlas of a Long Forgotten
World by Ken Horton. Hmm.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.475
Do you think
he'll sign it for me?

02:54.508 --> 02:55.676
Well, let's go find out.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.877
Come on.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.995
Horton, welcome back.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.464
Marcus, so good
to see you.

03:16.497 --> 03:17.998
It's Malcolm. Malcolm.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.333
Of course.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.901
So sorry.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.035
This is
Dr. Shannon.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.747
She's gonna do your
physicals and blood work-ups.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.149
Yeah, just to be safe. You never
know what you might've been exposed to

03:26.173 --> 03:27.575
out there,
after all that time.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.077
Then I place myself entirely
in your capable hands.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.379
Okay.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.714
Maddy...

03:33.747 --> 03:35.816
Give them a hand
unpacking the rover, would you?

03:35.849 --> 03:38.218
There's a good chap.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.425
They say a man's
nature is revealed

03:44.458 --> 03:47.328
by how he
discharges his debts.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.672
Sounds like
a fortune cookie, Boylan.

03:48.696 --> 03:53.066
Mm, and you've made a
deal with the Sixers.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.003
Mira's calling in her favor.

03:56.036 --> 03:59.640
What's she want?

03:59.673 --> 04:03.210
Some kind of illness swept
through the Sixer camp.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.144
They need medicine.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.047
Don't they have you for that?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.182
Not this time.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.952
What they need is
tightly controlled.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.388
Azimeth, schedule II isomorph.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.625
It's kept in a locked
cabinet in the infirmary.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.226
You need an access card
to get to it.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.630
I don't have an access card.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.002
Mira's asking me
to rob my mother?

04:29.036 --> 04:31.939
Mira's the only one who
can talk to the future.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.308
Do you want to get
that girlfriend of yours

04:34.342 --> 04:36.610
to Terra Nova or not?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.127
Well, you don't seem
any worse for the wear

04:54.161 --> 04:55.062
of six months OTG.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.564
So I can go?

04:56.597 --> 04:59.433
Says here you had a
stroke four years ago.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.002
Not long after I came
through the portal, yes.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.003
Okay, well, I'd like

05:03.036 --> 05:05.706
to do a cerebro-scan just,
uh, get a better sense

05:05.739 --> 05:07.107
of how well you're recovering.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.176
It's been a long day.

05:09.209 --> 05:11.379
Can't that wait?

05:13.547 --> 05:16.183
I'll tell you what...
I'll make a deal with you.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.785
I'll schedule it for next week

05:17.818 --> 05:19.520
if you say hello
to my daughter.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.157
This is Maddy.
Hi.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.092
She's a huge fan.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.194
You don't say.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.463
Well, I've got to pop off
to the lab.

05:29.497 --> 05:31.432
Perhaps you'd like
to come along.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.935
Yeah!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.036
I can't tell you what.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.406
Atlas of a Long Forgotten World
means to me.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.007
When I first found out

05:40.040 --> 05:42.510
that my mom was recruited
to Terra Nova, I was terrified.

05:42.543 --> 05:45.045
You know, it seemed
so far away, so alien.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.048
Then I-I read
your book and...

05:48.081 --> 05:51.184
well, after that,
I couldn't wait to come.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.218
Oh, you're very sweet.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.625
Well, well, well,
look at all this mess.

05:57.658 --> 06:01.128
It'll take the balance of
my life to sort through it.

06:01.161 --> 06:05.699
Well, if there's anything
I can do, I'd be happy to help.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.768
In fact, I just finished
a medical internship,

06:07.801 --> 06:11.171
so I was kind of looking
for something new.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.907
But only if that
works for you.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.275
I'd be delighted.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.777
Really?

06:16.810 --> 06:17.810
Really.

06:19.346 --> 06:23.116
You can't do it, Josh.
You know that.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.752
If I don't, the deal's off.

06:26.019 --> 06:26.987
Do you have any idea

06:27.020 --> 06:29.590
what Taylor would do to
you if you got caught?

06:29.623 --> 06:32.292
You'd be lucky to get away
with just being banished.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.261
Guess I better not
get caught then.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.829
They're Sixers.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.331
It's not like
I'm giving them guns.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.267
They're sick,
they need the medicine.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.334
Oh, don't make this out

06:41.368 --> 06:43.737
to be some kind of
humanitarian gesture.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.340
I promised Kara
I'd get her here.

06:47.374 --> 06:49.543
Things in 2149
are getting worse every day.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.979
Mom will just have
to do without some chems.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.146
She'll cope.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.549
Glad to see you've got your
justifications all worked out.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.350
That's not fair.
You know what?

06:57.384 --> 07:00.020
I'm done.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.222
How do you even know

07:02.255 --> 07:04.067
that Mira and Boylan can do any
of the things they promised?

07:04.091 --> 07:07.661
You could be walking into
a world of hurt for nothing.

07:10.998 --> 07:14.367
Most of these specimens come
from the same valley.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.337
We found over 30
entirely new species.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.207
Things we never even knew
existed.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.709
They're beautiful.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.844
Mm, but first things first.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.481
Tomorrow we have to catalog
all the rock samples

07:27.515 --> 07:29.550
according to where
they were found.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.586
So, bring a light snack
and your love of dull tasks.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.255
And remember, don't take schist
for granite.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.490
That's very clever.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.295
You wrote that in your
first chapter of Geomorphisis.

07:42.329 --> 07:44.231
Right. Of course.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.169
Ah, the old memory's
not as sharp as it used to be.

07:49.202 --> 07:52.540
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.308
Would you mind signing
my copy of Atlas?

07:55.342 --> 07:57.344
Oh, I'd be happy to.

07:57.377 --> 07:58.555
And also, I've
been dying to know,

07:58.579 --> 08:00.614
did you ever get a chance

08:00.648 --> 08:03.150
to radioisotope the
coastal outcroppings?

08:03.183 --> 08:04.618
No.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.120
Continental drift never
interested me much.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.989
Really?

08:09.022 --> 08:11.358
'Cause in your letter, you
said that you couldn't wait

08:11.391 --> 08:14.127
to go to Terra Nova
to investigate it.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.395
I wrote you?

08:15.428 --> 08:16.997
Yeah. Years ago.

08:17.030 --> 08:20.433
I... I wrote you a fan letter
first, obviously.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.169
Oh, is it on here?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.671
Your reply? No.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.339
I used this stationary set
I got for Christmas,

08:26.373 --> 08:28.408
and in your response,
you said,

08:28.441 --> 08:30.377
it was quaint
to get a real letter,

08:30.410 --> 08:31.845
you had to answer in kind.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.089
It's okay if you don't remember.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.216
I mean, I'm sure you get tons
of dorky kids

08:36.249 --> 08:37.384
writing you, so...

08:37.417 --> 08:38.818
Do you still have it?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.854
Yeah, it's one
of my most prized possessions.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.498
I wouldn't have dreamt
of leaving it behind.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.256
Can I borrow it?

08:44.291 --> 08:47.327
I'd-I'd love to make a copy
for my archives.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.528
Really?

08:48.562 --> 08:52.299
I'm-I'm sure you've written
to tons more interesting people.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.501
But none as charming.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.003
Sure. I'll bring it in.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.470
Perfect.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.806
See you tomorrow, then?

08:58.839 --> 09:00.007
Yes.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.778
You owe me 500 terras,

09:04.812 --> 09:08.015
and this is what you
bring me as payment?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.984
It's not only broken.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.485
It's worthless.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.688
Look, I can come up
with the money.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.389
I just need more time.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.059
Three days,
and that's it.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.094
Thank you.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.040
Boylan?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.517
The Eleventh Pilgrimage
is next month,

09:34.541 --> 09:36.443
and I want proof
that Kara's really coming.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.778
How am I supposed to get proof?

09:37.811 --> 09:41.314
We're cut off from
2149, remember?

09:41.348 --> 09:44.051
Look, Mira's the only one
with a line to the future,

09:44.084 --> 09:46.253
and she's given me every
assurance that Kara...

09:46.286 --> 09:48.756
Well, if she wants those meds,
I want more than assurances.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.928
I will read you
a bedtime story.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.496
But you don't do
the voices right.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.699
I want Daddy to read
my bedtime story.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.467
Well, bad luck, kid.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.468
You're stuck with me.

10:01.501 --> 10:02.670
Daddy's gone fishing.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.604
Now go on,
wash up.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.675
Go on.

10:07.708 --> 10:08.709
Hey.
Hey.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.644
I hear
you have a new internship.

10:10.678 --> 10:11.745
Yeah.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.580
Well, I thought
you'd be thrilled.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.949
What's wrong?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.518
No, it's stupid.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.888
What? If you can't tell
your old mum something stupid,

10:20.921 --> 10:23.724
who can you tell? Hmm?

10:23.757 --> 10:25.492
It's just...

10:25.525 --> 10:29.129
Horton forgot this joke
from his first book, and then,

10:29.162 --> 10:32.432
he, like, totally contradicted
something he told me

10:32.465 --> 10:33.767
in his letter.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.568
Like, right here, he says...

10:37.504 --> 10:38.972
Wait...
the signatures don't match.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.974
Zoe, why is the
water still running?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.643
You better not be making
swamps for dinosaurs in there.

10:43.677 --> 10:44.978
Mom, the signatures
don't match.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.179
Oh, honey, he had a stroke.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.181
I mean, he's not the
man he was. I know, but...

10:48.215 --> 10:51.018
Heroes rarely live up
to our expectations of them.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.085
Maybe...

10:52.119 --> 10:53.987
I don't know.
Maybe you just need to think

10:54.021 --> 10:56.623
about all the things
that made you look up to him

10:56.656 --> 10:57.825
in the first place, okay?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.426
I need to go
and scold Zoe. Zoe!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.008
This one's all you, kid.

11:38.365 --> 11:42.903
We agreed you'd do as I
said, no questions asked,

11:42.936 --> 11:45.906
and now you demand proof?

11:45.939 --> 11:48.641
You're asking a lot.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.642
It's my mom.

11:49.676 --> 11:53.446
You're asking me to
steal from my mother.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.630
Kara?

12:10.663 --> 12:13.801
Oh... Oh, my God, Josh,
it's really you.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.369
I've missed you.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.106
Does this mean it's true,
what they're telling me

12:19.139 --> 12:21.008
about being
on the next Pilgrimage?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.877
I promised you I'd get you here.

12:23.911 --> 12:27.080
You kept your promise.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.690
What happened?

12:37.724 --> 12:38.491
Get her back.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.759
You'll have
plenty of time

12:39.793 --> 12:42.162
to talk once Boylan
gets her here.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.264
Proof enough?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.501
You'll get your meds.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.777
Well, how big

12:57.811 --> 12:59.980
would you say the
fish I caught was?

13:00.013 --> 13:02.682
Well, I'd say that fish was
as big as you want it to be.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.552
Well, I think we
should say eight feet.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.554
What?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.130
Fire's gone cold.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.200
Couple days old
at least.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.634
Sixers?

13:21.668 --> 13:24.437
They would never
be this careless.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.307
Terra Nova, standard issue.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.409
Curran.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.577
Curran?
Got to be.

13:30.610 --> 13:33.013
Who else would be living
out here on their own?

13:33.046 --> 13:35.916
Well, if he left it behind,
it must have been in a hurry.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.920
I tell you what...

13:39.953 --> 13:41.621
Why don't you head in?

13:41.654 --> 13:45.092
Tell Washington I'll be
out for another day or so.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.627
Wait, don't tell me
you're having a change of heart

13:47.660 --> 13:49.162
about banishing Curran?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.931
He murdered a fellow soldier.

13:50.964 --> 13:51.999
What do you think?

13:52.032 --> 13:56.436
So, you're, what,
you're going to kill him?

13:58.205 --> 14:02.109
Outpost five is just a couple
of clicks north of here.

14:02.142 --> 14:04.677
I'll pick up
a rover there.

14:04.711 --> 14:07.014
I'll see you back
at the colony.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.218
It's a damn shame what the mold

14:11.251 --> 14:12.886
did to these beautiful trees.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.624
As you can see,
every apple in Terra Nova...

14:17.657 --> 14:21.461
is inedible.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.529
Yeah, that's too bad.

14:22.562 --> 14:23.396
My little sister Zoe

14:23.430 --> 14:25.632
has always dreamt
of trying apple pie.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.569
By the way, did
you have a chance

14:29.602 --> 14:31.204
to look for
that letter?

14:31.238 --> 14:32.472
Yeah, I brought it with me.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.342
It's right here.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.513
Thank you.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.362
Remember that expedition you
were on when you wrote me

14:46.386 --> 14:49.789
with, um, gosh,
what was his name?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.824
I'm afraid I don't recall.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.027
Well, it was a
pretty big deal,

14:54.061 --> 14:55.604
you know, someone
you'd worked with before.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.197
Come on, you must remember.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.865
I don't.

14:58.898 --> 15:03.803
Details become so jumbled.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.407
When you're my age,
you'll understand.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.977
Right. Sorry.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.544
What's this?

15:13.746 --> 15:18.751
A few hundred miles north,
I found a species of beetle.

15:18.785 --> 15:22.289
They feed
on the apple blight mold.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.492
Hmm. Well, go ahead, open it.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.694
Go on.

15:43.176 --> 15:46.646
In a few weeks,
Zoe can have her pie.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.754
At first I just thought
he was embarrassed

16:18.778 --> 16:22.615
because he didn't remember,
and then he got...

16:22.649 --> 16:26.753
I don't know, mad almost.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.390
Maybe Mom's right... maybe
I just expected too much.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.559
Maybe he wants
your blood.

16:32.592 --> 16:33.560
What?

16:33.593 --> 16:36.563
Well, my friend Nina said
a vampire came through

16:36.596 --> 16:37.730
on the last Pilgrimage.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.167
Your friend Nina is just trying
to scare you.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.771
Well, maybe one will come
on the 11th.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.207
We can hope.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.102
Oh, hey,

17:15.135 --> 17:16.669
I got xiph kebabs
for dinner tonight.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.506
I'm late for work,
I'm gonna eat at the bar.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.773
Okay, well, don't
work too late.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.646
Something wrong?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.482
No, everything's fine.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.751
Okay, see you.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.763
Copied the
access code.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.441
But you stripped the
identification info, right?

17:45.465 --> 17:47.134
Like, it won't trace
back to her?

17:47.167 --> 17:50.270
No one is going to know
it's your mum's badge.

17:56.609 --> 17:57.610
What's that for?

17:57.644 --> 18:00.012
In case someone
walks in on you.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.715
One shot with this on
the lowest setting,

18:02.749 --> 18:04.817
they won't even remember
their own name.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.450
Damn it, Boylan.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.229
Curran, wake up.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.196
I said wake up.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.997
Now, that is
one nasty-looking leg wound.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.537
Stinks, too.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.908
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.953
And you just left him out there?

19:46.986 --> 19:50.757
I wasn't about to wrestle him
into the rover, Wash.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.292
What do you think
he's going to do

19:52.325 --> 19:53.893
to Curran if
he finds him?

19:53.926 --> 19:55.462
I don't know...

19:55.495 --> 19:57.797
but I wouldn't want to be
in his shoes right now.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.275
Anyway, it's a good
thing you're back.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.568
We had a break-in in the
infirmary last night.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.375
Broke in through the window.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
Knew exactly which
room to target.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.779
And exactly
what they were after.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.881
They've taken every
vial of Azimeth.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.015
Yeah, makes sense.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.084
It's got
a high street value.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.052
Well, yeah, in
Chicago, but

20:20.086 --> 20:21.163
here we barely have streets.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.789
I mean, you think
there's Azimeth junkies

20:22.822 --> 20:24.257
in Terra Nova?

20:24.291 --> 20:26.459
I'll tell you one thing...
You gotta be high,

20:26.493 --> 20:31.063
drunk, or desperate
to use a sonic pistol

20:31.097 --> 20:32.932
indoors
in such close quarters.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.100
Whoever did this

20:34.133 --> 20:36.436
is hurting this morning.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.346
Hey, where's Horton?

20:46.379 --> 20:47.447
Just running
some tests.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.715
Can I help you?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.718
His preliminary report should
have been filed yesterday.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.629
How am I supposed to allocate
lab resources when he...?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.788
I want to talk to you
about your report.

20:55.822 --> 20:56.623
What was that?

20:56.656 --> 20:59.025
The summary of
your findings?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.092
Sorry, I can't hear you.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.794
The summary of your...!

21:03.062 --> 21:04.864
Really?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.133
Have your report on
my desk by Monday

21:07.166 --> 21:09.502
or I'll cut
your funding.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.639
How's that for funny?

21:14.741 --> 21:15.442
Oh, I gotta go.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.109
I have to drop
Zoe off at school.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.545
9:00 tomorrow?

21:18.578 --> 21:19.446
Yeah.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.714
Uh, by the way, can
I get my letter?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.984
Certainly. Of course.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.487
Um... let's see,

21:27.520 --> 21:31.358
I scanned it and then
I put it, uh...

21:31.391 --> 21:33.460
somewhere.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.962
Look, I'm sure
it'll turn up.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.063
Yeah, that's okay.

21:37.096 --> 21:38.264
I'll just get it
another time.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.740
Why would he pretend
to lose my letter?

21:47.774 --> 21:49.842
The only thing I can
think of is that he knew

21:49.876 --> 21:51.019
that the signatures
didn't match,

21:51.043 --> 21:53.145
but... so what?

21:53.179 --> 21:55.047
He supposedly had
a stroke, right?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.316
Maybe you should trick him
into eating garlic.

21:57.350 --> 21:58.317
What?

21:58.351 --> 22:00.319
It burns them.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.356
Zoe, he's still not a vampire.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.792
I think he is.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.762
I have to get that letter back.

22:13.400 --> 22:15.802
So, what now, are you
going to kill me?

22:18.104 --> 22:21.541
You seem to be doing a pretty
good job of that yourself.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.719
Drink this
it'll help the infection.

22:32.752 --> 22:35.187
You've been hit
by an ancestral Komodo.

22:35.221 --> 22:38.357
I was trying
to set a snare.

22:38.391 --> 22:40.292
It was on me before
I even saw it.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.461
Took one bite and left.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.295
No, it didn't leave.

22:43.329 --> 22:46.332
It's tracking you.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.934
Komodos are cowards.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.736
They hang back

22:49.769 --> 22:54.306
till they're confident that
their prey is incapacitated.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.008
They've got bacteria

22:56.042 --> 23:00.613
that lives in special ducts
under their tongues.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.983
One bite
and you're infected.

23:05.284 --> 23:06.429
When you're too weak
to fight back,

23:06.453 --> 23:09.121
Komodo moves in,
finishes the job.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.425
Why are you helping?

23:12.459 --> 23:14.360
You're the one
who exiled me for murder.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.363
Lay back,
gather your strength.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.999
Let me worry about the Komodo.

24:48.555 --> 24:50.823
No, I don't understand
how anyone could justify

24:50.857 --> 24:52.525
stealing from a hospital.

24:52.559 --> 24:53.936
You know, when you're
looking to get high,

24:53.960 --> 24:55.795
you don't care
about anything else.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.330
Look at that kid, your
buddy who got a parasite

24:58.364 --> 25:00.567
from drinking
Taroca root.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.669
Hunter had nothing
to do with this, Dad.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.371
I didn't say that he did.

25:05.404 --> 25:06.615
Well, I just hope
you can recover

25:06.639 --> 25:08.808
some of the missing chems.

25:08.841 --> 25:11.077
I have a patient with
a rare neurological disorder,

25:11.110 --> 25:12.679
and the only thing
that's going to help

25:12.712 --> 25:14.547
is a small dose
of Azimeth.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.716
She'll die without
that treatment.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.117
Can't you order more?

25:18.150 --> 25:19.595
I have to wait
till the 11th Pilgrimage

25:19.619 --> 25:21.120
just to requisition it.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.593
That's just stupid.

25:26.626 --> 25:27.970
Has anyone ever thought
that the thing

25:27.994 --> 25:31.230
this place needs most is a way
to communicate with 2149?

25:32.699 --> 25:34.867
What's wrong with him?

25:37.704 --> 25:39.606
You know what I think?

25:39.639 --> 25:44.410
I think the stroke's just a way
of him explaining his mistakes.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.680
He's not, he's not
the real Ken Horton.

25:47.714 --> 25:48.981
No, he stole his identity

25:49.015 --> 25:51.017
to come to Terra
Nova in his place.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.219
Probably paid some Facer
a fortune to help him.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.787
What's a Facer?

25:55.955 --> 25:59.859
They're... doctors that make
you look like someone else.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.394
That's how he got rid
of his fangs.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.396
Do you talk like that in school?

26:04.430 --> 26:05.898
'Cause you sound crazy.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.736
But then again,
look at me.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.871
Facers, stolen
identities...

26:12.639 --> 26:13.940
And I don't even
have any proof.

26:13.973 --> 26:15.642
I mean, he burnt
the letter.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.912
But I kept the envelope.

26:20.913 --> 26:25.117
And the real Horton licked it,
so it has his DNA.

26:26.518 --> 26:29.255
So all I have to
do is get a sample

26:29.288 --> 26:30.657
of the fake Horton's DNA

26:30.690 --> 26:32.058
and compare it, right?

26:32.091 --> 26:33.459
Now, all these specimens

26:33.492 --> 26:35.227
have to be cataloged
in the database

26:35.261 --> 26:37.697
according to
their phyla.

26:37.730 --> 26:38.965
Phyla... got it.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.500
Oh, it was Dr. Grazier,
by the way.

26:43.335 --> 26:47.573
The colleague I was working
with back in 2144.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.108
You asked about him
yesterday.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.777
Oh, right, yeah.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.679
Was there a question
about our expedition?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.747
Uh, yeah.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.983
I don't remember
what it was, sorry.

26:57.016 --> 27:00.019
Oh, well, it'll come back
to you just like it did to me.

27:02.021 --> 27:04.156
I'd better go get started, then.

27:04.190 --> 27:06.325
Yeah.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.068
What are you doing?

27:16.102 --> 27:17.303
Whoa, you need
authorization

27:17.336 --> 27:18.871
to use the DNA sampler.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.506
Oh, sorry, I didn't realize.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.541
Whose DNA are
you comparing?

27:25.244 --> 27:26.112
If you don't have

27:26.145 --> 27:27.113
the subject's permission,
this is

27:27.146 --> 27:28.748
a very serious violation
of privacy.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.751
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.089
I just, I just think
that maybe.

27:37.123 --> 27:40.092
Horton isn't
who he says he is,

27:40.126 --> 27:42.361
and I promise,
I think I can prove it.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.263
If you just give me
ten more minutes, I...

27:44.296 --> 27:46.565
Come again? You think
Horton's a fraud?

27:46.598 --> 27:48.567
Yeah.

27:50.469 --> 27:51.303
Watch out, watch out.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.405
It'll go faster if I help.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.758
Josh?

28:12.725 --> 28:15.762
Yeah.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.597
I'm meeting
Mira tonight.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.399
Once they get
their meds,

28:20.432 --> 28:23.635
they're going to let me
contact my people in 2149,

28:23.669 --> 28:25.437
and it's official...

28:26.438 --> 28:27.573
Kara's on the 11th.

28:29.441 --> 28:31.443
That's great.

28:31.477 --> 28:34.914
Thank you...
for everything.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.218
My dad's asking
a lot of questions.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.619
I don't think
he's gonna stop

28:40.652 --> 28:41.864
until he figures out
the whole truth.

28:41.888 --> 28:44.156
Well, the truth
would be very bad

28:44.190 --> 28:45.992
for business.

28:52.698 --> 28:53.942
Why don't you cut
out early tonight?

28:53.966 --> 28:55.802
Go and hang out with
the family, you know,

28:55.835 --> 28:59.305
play the dutiful son, and
I promise, by tomorrow,

28:59.338 --> 29:01.473
no one will suspect you.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.510
Okay.

29:13.853 --> 29:16.889
Hey, Willy...
how'd you like

29:16.923 --> 29:19.458
to work off that money
you owe me?

29:19.491 --> 29:22.694
Oh, it's a match.

29:22.728 --> 29:24.296
No, not possible.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.540
No, I'm afraid
there's no question.

29:25.564 --> 29:27.466
Dr. Horton is
who he says he is.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.501
I was so sure.

29:29.535 --> 29:30.545
I'm sorry I
wasted your time.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.603
No, no problem.

29:31.637 --> 29:32.839
I guess I'll just have

29:32.872 --> 29:36.508
to keep putting up
with his casual insolence

29:36.542 --> 29:39.145
and being treated
like his research assistant.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.481
Thanks for helping me out.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.216
No, no, not at all.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.452
Better delete
those files, eh?

29:46.485 --> 29:48.787
Yeah.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.232
You wanted to see me?

30:00.266 --> 30:01.700
Yeah, my patient
here stumbled in,

30:01.733 --> 30:03.335
complaining he
cracked a rib.

30:03.369 --> 30:04.971
Claims he fell
down some stairs.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.281
On the same night
as the break-in.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.983
What an amazing coincidence.
My thoughts exactly,

30:08.007 --> 30:10.442
so I ran him
through the iso-scanner

30:10.476 --> 30:14.480
and his tissue exhibits damage
consistent with a sonic blast.

30:14.513 --> 30:16.082
Must hurt like hell.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.885
Not at the moment... luckily
for him, he's high on Azimeth.

30:18.918 --> 30:20.752
Nice work.

30:20.786 --> 30:22.354
Think I'll take a look
around his place.

30:22.388 --> 30:25.291
Yeah, let me know as soon
as you find those chems.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.927
My patient's due another
treatment in a few days.

31:02.528 --> 31:03.562
Beat it.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.102
Go on! Scram!

31:10.836 --> 31:13.105
Get outta here!

31:26.152 --> 31:27.886
Good, you're awake.

31:29.621 --> 31:30.456
The Komodo?

31:30.489 --> 31:34.526
Like I told you,
Komodos are cowards.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.762
You've just got
to face a coward down.

31:36.795 --> 31:39.665
You never answered me.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.334
Why save a murderer?

31:42.368 --> 31:45.037
I like a good redemption story.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.306
You play
your cards right,

31:47.339 --> 31:49.708
I might even let you
back inside the gates.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.412
What do you
expect in return?

31:53.445 --> 31:56.515
You travel to the coordinates
I marked on your map.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.751
The Sixer camp is somewhere
in that area, up in the trees.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.320
You won't have
to try to find them.

32:01.353 --> 32:03.222
You just stumble around,
they'll find you.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.524
Yeah, and when I do,
they'll kill me.

32:05.557 --> 32:06.292
I don't think so.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.726
You murdered
a Terra Novan.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.129
They might even bake you a cake.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.865
You tell 'em
you're seeking asylum,

32:13.899 --> 32:16.302
you make friends,
ingratiate yourself.

32:16.335 --> 32:17.669
You're gonna find out for me

32:17.703 --> 32:20.706
who inside Terra Nova is
supplying information to Mira.

32:20.739 --> 32:21.940
If she's
got a spy,

32:21.974 --> 32:23.809
she's gonna keep that
secret pretty close.

32:23.842 --> 32:26.478
You do it, Curran...

32:26.512 --> 32:28.214
or the next time
I track you down,

32:28.247 --> 32:32.284
the last thing you're going
to see alive will be my face.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.389
What Malcolm said
got me thinking.

32:37.423 --> 32:38.957
Horton was
an important guy.

32:38.991 --> 32:40.292
Tons of research projects.

32:40.326 --> 32:42.594
He must have had
some sort of assistant,

32:42.628 --> 32:44.997
you know, someone to handle
his correspondence.

32:45.031 --> 32:47.199
Maybe Horton did actually
write the letter,

32:47.233 --> 32:49.435
but his assistant was the one
that mailed it,

32:49.468 --> 32:51.803
and that's why the DNA matches
but the signatures don't.

32:51.837 --> 32:53.105
What if he stole

32:53.139 --> 32:55.841
his boss's identity
to get to Terra Nova?

32:55.874 --> 32:57.709
So are they both vampires?

32:58.944 --> 33:00.112
Sometimes you worry me.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.713
Go on, I'll pick you up

33:01.747 --> 33:03.682
after school.

33:09.021 --> 33:11.323
Who was Ken Horton's
research assistant?

33:12.058 --> 33:14.893
Andrew Fickett.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.928
Same height, age, build.

33:16.962 --> 33:19.431
Whereabouts unknown.

33:19.465 --> 33:23.169
Any mention of him stops right
before Horton's Pilgrimage.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.204
Bring up all the
crimes in Cambridge

33:25.237 --> 33:28.174
for the preceding
six months.

33:29.575 --> 33:31.910
Here.

33:31.943 --> 33:33.945
"Unidentified male
found in park..."

33:33.979 --> 33:36.982
"Eyes and hands mutilated,

33:37.015 --> 33:39.285
identification impossible."

33:40.952 --> 33:43.021
Oh, my God.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.923
He didn't just steal
his identity.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.359
He killed him.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.531
Reading material like that's
liable to give you nightmares.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.732
I should go.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.134
My mom's expecting me.

33:55.167 --> 33:57.969
Your mother's
in surgery.

33:58.003 --> 34:00.038
No one's expecting you.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.975
I'm sorry. I thought I had
the reservation for 2:00.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.278
Uh, that's okay.
I was just leaving.

34:17.856 --> 34:21.025
We searched his house, and
found only one empty bottle.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.895
Where's the rest
of the Azimeth?

34:23.929 --> 34:25.864
I used it.

34:25.897 --> 34:26.965
You'd be in a coma.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.900
Okay.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.636
I sold it.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.003
To who?

34:32.036 --> 34:33.405
I don't remember.

34:33.438 --> 34:35.407
You going to arrest me or what?

34:35.440 --> 34:37.676
That's what you want, isn't it?

34:38.844 --> 34:41.246
Question is...

34:42.914 --> 34:43.914
...why?

34:45.817 --> 34:46.952
Hey!

34:46.985 --> 34:48.554
You covering for somebody?

34:49.721 --> 34:50.922
Are you?
Who is it?

34:52.958 --> 34:55.025
It was Boylan.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.895
It was Boylan!

34:56.928 --> 34:57.963
Yeah.

34:57.996 --> 34:58.964
Should have known.

34:58.997 --> 35:01.967
Keep an eye
on this joker.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.001
Sorry I'm late,
Mrs. Reed.

35:03.034 --> 35:04.570
I was looking
for my dad.

35:04.603 --> 35:05.437
Is Zoe ready?

35:05.471 --> 35:07.139
I really have
to go find him.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.608
Dr. Horton picked her up
a few minutes ago.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.877
Dr. Horton?
You let her leave with him?

35:11.910 --> 35:13.279
I'm sorry.
He said you knew.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.046
Oh, my God.
Where'd they go?

35:15.080 --> 35:16.014
They went that way.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.916
The orchards.

35:32.063 --> 35:33.865
When will there be pie?

35:33.899 --> 35:34.933
Hmm. Soon.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.068
Just have to wait for
a few more of these to ripen.

35:37.102 --> 35:39.070
Get away from her.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.007
Leave now, or I'll
tell everyone...

35:42.040 --> 35:43.108
What?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.345
Tell everyone
I saved the apple harvest?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.448
Why don't you find something
more interesting

35:49.481 --> 35:52.684
for your little sister to do
while we have a chat?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.888
Zoe, run and find Dad, okay?

35:56.922 --> 36:00.592
Tell him I'll be home in plenty
of time to make the asparagus.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.465
Nicely done.

36:07.899 --> 36:09.401
Daddy! Daddy!

36:09.435 --> 36:12.238
Hey, Z. Daddy's got to go
catch a bad guy, okay?

36:12.271 --> 36:14.072
But...
Wait.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.942
Shouldn't Maddy be watching you?

36:16.975 --> 36:19.245
She said to tell you

36:19.278 --> 36:22.581
something
very important.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.783
If anything happens
to me, my dad will...

36:24.816 --> 36:27.152
Oh, he'll suspect, all right,
but without proof, he'll...

36:37.363 --> 36:39.265
Can't let you go.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.632
Sorry.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.310
Andrew, right?

36:51.343 --> 36:52.944
I know what it's like

36:52.978 --> 36:56.047
to be the one in the
background, overshadowed.

36:56.081 --> 36:59.585
In my old school, everybody was
happy to cheat off my homework,

36:59.618 --> 37:02.153
but no one even
knew my name.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.989
It's not fair.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.459
You did all that work, all those
years, and Horton was recruited.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.564
Killing him was wrong, but
you've more than made up for it.

37:12.598 --> 37:13.932
You deserve a second chance.

37:13.965 --> 37:17.503
I mean, isn't that
what this place is about?

37:17.536 --> 37:19.505
Promise I won't tell
anyone what I know.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.274
Ha! You're never gonna
let this go.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.309
He was your hero.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.346
Funny thing is,
you would have hated him.

37:27.379 --> 37:28.747
He lied to everyone,

37:28.780 --> 37:30.282
stole research.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.017
I wanted to save you
from all that.

37:32.050 --> 37:35.321
I wanted to be
the perfect Dr. Kenneth Horton,

37:35.354 --> 37:37.222
but you...

37:37.255 --> 37:39.858
had to keep that letter.

37:44.663 --> 37:47.098
The spider's bite is painless.

37:47.132 --> 37:48.500
Please...

37:48.534 --> 37:52.237
Your family will just think
you fell asleep and got stung.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.221
You okay?

38:10.255 --> 38:12.057
You all right?

38:12.090 --> 38:13.325
Okay.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.663
It's all right.
It's okay.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.331
When I think about

38:19.365 --> 38:21.600
what almost
happened out there...

38:21.633 --> 38:23.402
Thank God
for your panic words.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.537
Asparagus?

38:26.805 --> 38:30.275
I always thought
you were being paranoid.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.511
But I guess
I was wrong.

38:34.245 --> 38:36.882
Hey.
You feeling better, sweetie?

38:36.915 --> 38:39.585
Yeah, a little.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.353
Maddy, what on earth
possessed you

38:41.387 --> 38:45.256
to try and deal with
all of this on your own?

38:45.290 --> 38:47.926
I didn't have any proof.

38:50.629 --> 38:53.799
And I did try and talk
to you, Mom.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.168
Yes, you're right.
You did.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.537
But if I'm not
listening to you,

38:58.570 --> 39:00.539
then you have
to make me listen, okay?

39:00.572 --> 39:02.674
Or you go and get
your father.

39:02.708 --> 39:03.642
Yeah.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.143
That being said,

39:05.176 --> 39:07.446
you trusted you gut, even
when all the evidence was

39:07.479 --> 39:08.747
against you.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.617
Proud of you.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.720
I just keep thinking
of Dr. Horton.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.221
You know, how he
was just killed

39:16.254 --> 39:20.358
before he could even come
here and live out his dream.

39:24.463 --> 39:25.897
Do you think the things

39:25.931 --> 39:27.966
that Fickett said
about him were true?

39:27.999 --> 39:31.036
All I know is that the
real Horton took the time

39:31.069 --> 39:34.806
to write to a young girl
who loved his work.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.575
That's right.

39:46.618 --> 39:47.819
What's going on?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.555
Go check on Zoe.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.094
What are you doing with this?

39:56.127 --> 39:57.672
It's for your patient.
I swear, I didn't know.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.364
I didn't think
anyone would get hurt.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.568
You broke into
a clinic.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.170
You stole from
your mother.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.337
You didn't think

40:06.371 --> 40:07.439
anyone would get hurt?

40:07.473 --> 40:09.608
I'm sorry.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.443
I don't understand.

40:11.477 --> 40:12.844
Did you use it?

40:13.645 --> 40:14.880
Did you sell it?

40:16.214 --> 40:18.817
I gave it all to the
Sixers... The Sixers?!

40:18.850 --> 40:20.952
Why, Josh?

40:20.986 --> 40:23.822
They promised me
they'd get Kara here.

40:23.855 --> 40:26.692
Who?

40:26.725 --> 40:28.894
Who said the Sixers
could do that?

40:33.532 --> 40:35.501
I hate violence.

40:35.534 --> 40:38.436
It's never the answer.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.371
You got my son caught up
with the Sixers.

40:40.405 --> 40:41.873
He could've been killed.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.976
Look, the kid came to me
with a problem. I was just...

40:45.010 --> 40:47.278
Yeah, and you gave
him false hope.

40:47.312 --> 40:50.281
The Sixers don't have the
technology to get his girlfriend here.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.683
They can barely
feed themselves.

40:51.717 --> 40:54.853
I might be a lot of things,
Shannon, but I am no liar.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.524
Now I don't know
how she does it, but...

41:00.458 --> 41:03.795
Mira can talk to the future.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.867
No, no, that's not possible.

41:08.900 --> 41:12.738
The portal has to be open
to talk to 2149.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.372
Well, apparently,
the Sixers

41:14.405 --> 41:16.808
have figured out
a way around that.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.280
Lucas.

41:22.313 --> 41:25.250
Your son? What about him?

41:34.292 --> 41:36.895
The kid's a genius.

41:36.928 --> 41:41.266
The whole reason
they recruited him

41:41.299 --> 41:43.802
was so he could try to figure
out some way to communicate

41:43.835 --> 41:47.238
with Hope Plaza
between pilgrimages.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.009
You think the Sixers
captured him

41:51.042 --> 41:53.111
and forced him
to work for them?

41:58.650 --> 42:03.021
Look, if you're right,
then at least

42:03.054 --> 42:06.224
there's a chance
he's still alive.

42:06.257 --> 42:09.761
There might even be a chance
of getting him out of there

42:09.795 --> 42:11.597
and bringing him back home.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.399
No, Shannon.

42:14.432 --> 42:17.603
There's no chance
of that.

42:17.636 --> 42:20.606
No chance at all.

42:20.639 --> 42:22.741
How do you know that?

42:26.878 --> 42:30.281
How are things
between you and Josh?

42:32.818 --> 42:36.087
They've been better.

42:36.121 --> 42:39.157
Fathers and sons.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.893
Let me put it this way.

42:43.428 --> 42:44.963
Maybe you should be grateful

42:44.996 --> 42:47.298
that the worst you have
to worry about

42:47.332 --> 42:51.336
is your boy getting in over
his head because of a girl.
