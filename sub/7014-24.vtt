00:04.980 --> 00:07.734
Guys... I have to tell you about
this dream I had.

00:07.768 --> 00:10.657
No. Eric, I can't hear another one
of your lame dreams.

00:10.707 --> 00:16.199
"Guys, I dreamt I was purple and I could fly
and luke skywalker was my lab partner."

00:16.703 --> 00:19.670
No. It was about donna.

00:19.832 --> 00:22.378
Okay, it was five years in the future.

00:22.467 --> 00:25.629
Five years in the future?
Did you see jackie?

00:25.705 --> 00:29.427
How's she holdin' up?
Do I need to get out now?

00:29.719 --> 00:33.985
Hyde, in my dream, donna gave up
her life plans to be with me.

00:34.103 --> 00:37.059
And she was so miserable, she left me.

00:37.832 --> 00:39.309
That's it ?

00:39.393 --> 00:43.525
I took my feet off the table
and turned slightly to the left for that?

00:45.070 --> 00:50.504
Look, you guys, what if I really am holding donna
back.. and she just doesn't realize it yet?

00:51.486 --> 00:53.921
I feel like I could be ruining both of our lives.

00:53.974 --> 00:58.635
Eric, relax, okay? It's just a stress dream, 'cause
you're gettin' married tomorrow.

00:58.676 --> 01:05.233
Now I had a dream last night that's worth telling.
Okay, donna was in a wet t-shirt contest...

01:10.941 --> 01:14.296
No, I can't. Forget it. It's too dirty.

01:15.888 --> 01:17.326
So who's gonna be your best man?

01:17.366 --> 01:21.249
Oh, you know what? Why don't you guys
just decide who my best man is?

01:21.383 --> 01:27.040
Whoa, you want us to choose? Well, if that's not
an invitation to dress a dog up in a tuxedo,

01:27.067 --> 01:29.393
I don't know what it is.

01:29.862 --> 01:33.100
All right. If anyone should be
the best man, it's me.

01:33.181 --> 01:36.003
I'm gonna be a father, so I really need the money.

01:37.105 --> 01:39.846
You don't get paid to be the best man.

01:39.886 --> 01:43.622
You do it for the satisfaction
of nailing the hottest bridesmaid.

01:43.675 --> 01:45.341
It's in the bible.

01:45.892 --> 01:49.022
Well, I can't do that, 'cause I'm bringin' brooke.

01:49.144 --> 01:51.698
Yeah, we're getting pretty serious.

01:51.845 --> 01:56.145
Girls, man.. you get 'em pregnant,
they get all clingy.

hey, on earth, green means go!

02:17.258 --> 02:20.765
Gosh, I didn't know they let
brain-dead morons drive cars.

02:20.805 --> 02:24.957
And I didn't know they let brain-dead morons
into the police academy.

02:25.024 --> 02:27.322
Oh, they do!

02:28.625 --> 02:29.405
Brooke?

02:32.535 --> 02:36.069
Hi, michael. This is my mother.

02:38.165 --> 02:43.229
Yeah, we.. we met. It didn't go very well.

Merci Ã  Raceman

03:24.080 --> 03:25.877
Here she is.

03:25.955 --> 03:30.408
Welcome, or as I like to say,
happy trailers to you.

03:31.952 --> 03:34.132
A trailer.

03:34.408 --> 03:37.439
Well, son, you finally made it.

03:37.569 --> 03:40.774
Well, and.. and.. and just look
at all the nature.

03:40.850 --> 03:45.876
I mean, right in your front yard,
you have a beautiful apple core.

03:46.605 --> 03:49.522
Donna... don't take offense, but

03:49.574 --> 03:51.736
a trailer? I think you could do better.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.810
Oh, that's funny. I was
just thinking so could my dad.

03:54.914 --> 03:59.263
Hey, watch it, donna. She's wrong, pammy.
I can't do better than you.

03:59.315 --> 04:02.023
I've tried and failed on several occasions.

04:02.075 --> 04:07.518
Oh, bobby. Oh, I think I hear a chicken.
I'll be in the car.

04:07.596 --> 04:09.341
I'll go with you.

04:09.445 --> 04:14.010
We're in the honeymoon stage where
she doesn't mind if I get handsy.

04:19.873 --> 04:21.019
Well,

04:21.618 --> 04:24.457
I think this place is great.

04:24.509 --> 04:30.681
You can just drive your car right up to it,
and then you have a walk-in closet.

04:30.993 --> 04:33.623
And look at our teeny, tiny bathroom.

04:33.701 --> 04:37.582
Eric, can I talk to you privately
in the living roo..

04:38.415 --> 04:40.967
..the, uh, dining...

04:41.045 --> 04:44.040
..the left front quadrant?

04:47.238 --> 04:48.931
Son...

04:49.035 --> 04:52.082
living here is a real bad idea.

04:52.160 --> 04:55.754
There's no privacy. Where will you hide
if donna has a chore for you?

04:55.832 --> 04:58.488
You'll have to dive under the trailer.

04:58.670 --> 05:02.081
Honey, would you help me unload some
groceries from the car?

05:02.160 --> 05:07.394
See what I mean? I'm cornered, like an animal..
Coming, honey.

05:08.149 --> 05:11.587
Your life is gonna be a living hell.

05:16.827 --> 05:20.421
So... home sweet home.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.817
Yeah.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.280
Hey, donna, um... hey...

05:27.608 --> 05:30.733
Um, don't take this the wrong way, but...

05:31.593 --> 05:34.107
is this really what we want?

05:34.289 --> 05:36.789
What? Of course it is.

05:36.971 --> 05:38.065
Why?

05:38.117 --> 05:41.502
I don't know. I just... you know,
it's such a big step. And,

05:41.581 --> 05:44.185
I just really want to make sure
this is what we want, what you want.

05:44.237 --> 05:46.945
Eric, the life I want is with you.

05:47.154 --> 05:48.716
I love you.

05:48.924 --> 05:52.232
Yeah, I know, but.. wait a minute.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.669
This isn't about this place. This is about me.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.117
No. Are you having doubts about me?

05:58.169 --> 06:03.403
Because if you are, tell me now. Don't wait, like, ten years
from now when we're both too fat to get dates.

06:03.482 --> 06:08.924
No, no, no, forget it. I'm happy.
I'm happy, happy, happy, happy.

06:09.049 --> 06:11.153
Okay, now you're saying "happy" way too much.

06:11.209 --> 06:13.509
Uh, because I'm very happy.

06:13.559 --> 06:18.570
If I were less happy, I'd say it less.
I think that's how language works, donna.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.122
Okay.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.722
I'm gonna go pump out the toilet.

06:31.185 --> 06:33.435
So forman nixed our best man idea.

06:33.518 --> 06:37.752
Apparently you wearing a giant trench coat
and standing on my shoulders isn't classy.

06:38.352 --> 06:42.769
Not classy? Did you tell him I'll be wearing
a plastic flower that sprays water?

06:44.319 --> 06:47.069
So let's just do rock, paper, scissors
to see who the best man is, all right?

06:47.135 --> 06:50.369
No, no, no, no. I hate that game.
I always lose.

06:51.158 --> 06:53.509
'Cause you always pick rock.

06:54.158 --> 06:56.558
That's because nothing beats rock.

06:57.358 --> 06:59.458
Paper beats rock. Those are the rules.

06:59.525 --> 07:01.425
Eh, not buying it.

07:02.975 --> 07:06.286
Fine. We'll play a new game. How about

07:07.075 --> 07:10.974
cockroach, foot, nuclear bomb?

07:12.342 --> 07:15.289
Foot squashes cockroach.

07:15.639 --> 07:19.206
Nuclear bomb... blows up foot.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.896
And cockroach...

07:22.489 --> 07:24.989
survives nuclear bomb.

07:25.889 --> 07:28.473
Oh, that's great.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.823
I'll be nuclear bomb. Nothing beats nuclear bomb.

07:32.723 --> 07:36.609
I just told you, cockroach beats nuclear bomb.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.873
Oh, we'll see about that.

07:41.256 --> 07:42.323
Laurie,

07:42.439 --> 07:46.356
it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride in a
wedding dress. Make sure eric doesn't come in.

07:46.406 --> 07:48.539
What, you want laurie to guard the door?

07:48.573 --> 07:51.889
She's never kept a man out of anywhere in her entire life.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.089
That is not true.

07:55.789 --> 07:57.772
Jackie, watch the door.

07:59.306 --> 08:03.622
So... donna, rehearsal dinner tonight,
wedding tomorrow, you excited?

08:03.673 --> 08:06.173
Um, actually, I'm a little nervous.

08:06.222 --> 08:08.489
Oh, that's just cold feet.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.022
Yeah, but here's the thing--

08:10.089 --> 08:13.539
whenever anyone's nervous about marriage,
everyone says it's just cold feet.

08:13.589 --> 08:18.672
But half of all marriage send in divorce, so half of those
people getting married should have cold feet.

08:18.922 --> 08:22.755
But by the time they realize their feet
were right, it's too late.

08:23.093 --> 08:24.757
Too late!

08:25.477 --> 08:29.293
How do I know what to do?
There is no answer!

08:29.427 --> 08:31.294
I can't breathe.

08:32.844 --> 08:34.977
How you feel is totally normal.

08:35.027 --> 08:40.727
A lot of the guys that I'm dating were nervous before
their weddings, but now they're all happily married.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.770
You do make a mother proud.

08:47.887 --> 08:48.870
Ready?

08:49.449 --> 08:51.030
One, two, three.

08:52.814 --> 08:57.537
Cockroach beats nuclear bomb.
That is 38 wins in a row.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.853
I think it's safe to say that I'm the best man.

09:01.964 --> 09:04.964
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I just noticed something.

09:05.137 --> 09:08.069
Cockroach always wins.

09:08.970 --> 09:11.320
One more time, for all the marbles.

09:12.220 --> 09:15.538
Fine. One, two, three.

09:16.237 --> 09:19.270
Foot, I forgot about foot.

09:19.870 --> 09:22.553
So foot always wins.

09:23.587 --> 09:27.928
One more time. Winner, best man, period.

09:28.778 --> 09:30.961
One, two, three.

09:32.945 --> 09:37.287
Bomb?! Nuclear bomb beat foot. It's like
everything in this game loses to something else!

09:38.403 --> 09:40.253
Yes, it's exactly like that.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.170
Wait, except...

09:42.520 --> 09:44.170
aha.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.003
I was so blind.

09:48.903 --> 09:51.900
Nuclear bomb beats everything.

09:52.153 --> 09:55.193
One more time, winner take all.

09:56.010 --> 09:58.160
One, two, three.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.743
I'm going home.

10:16.572 --> 10:17.706
Boy,

10:17.755 --> 10:23.439
wish I had a dollar for every awkward lunch I've had
with my mom and a strange guy that knocked me up.

10:27.987 --> 10:30.237
come on, guys, we have to get past this.

10:30.454 --> 10:32.787
- The baby's coming in a month.
- Oh,

10:32.870 --> 10:39.785
and michael's willing to wait that long. I'm surprised he doesn't
just honk his horn and try to scare it out in a week.

10:40.652 --> 10:44.135
Hey, if I wanted to scare a baby,
I wouldn't honk.

10:44.652 --> 10:47.802
I'd wear a mask and make ghost sounds.

10:50.269 --> 10:52.719
You were still rude.

10:52.935 --> 10:58.539
I think it's common courtesy to wait 30 seconds
at a green light before honking.

10:58.789 --> 11:01.355
Pass the rolls, please.

11:03.088 --> 11:05.005
Pass the rolls, please.

11:05.072 --> 11:10.322
I will, but I feel it's common courtesy
to wait 30 seconds before passing the rolls.

11:11.788 --> 11:15.357
Hey, I just remembered there's another room here.

11:17.691 --> 11:21.091
So, michael, I haven't told brooke yet,

11:21.157 --> 11:25.836
but I'm here to take her home to chicago
to have the baby and live with me.

11:26.107 --> 11:29.490
What? No, but I'm not in chicago.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.372
That's its major attraction.

11:34.972 --> 11:39.155
Oh, yeah? Well, what about the lake?

11:44.596 --> 11:46.802
Jackie, do you think eric and I are making a mistake?

11:46.834 --> 11:48.796
You are.

11:49.374 --> 11:52.841
But eric's just praying this whole thing
goes through before you notice.

11:53.814 --> 11:59.395
No, I'm serious. Up until now, everything in our
relationship has been really great..

11:59.507 --> 12:02.844
our first date, our first kiss,

12:02.938 --> 12:05.404
even getting engaged.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.844
But now, in the pit of my stomach,
I feel really sick.

12:08.911 --> 12:12.311
Come on, donna, you and eric are meant to be together.

12:12.364 --> 12:15.911
You're like a fat girl and a cat.
It just works, you know?

12:17.164 --> 12:19.257
Oh, come on.

12:19.817 --> 12:22.567
All right, look, I'm gonna go pick up my dress.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.950
And I'm gonna try not to look prettier than you,
but I can't promise.

12:39.511 --> 12:42.428
Oh, god, I can't do this.

12:52.053 --> 12:54.579
Okay, let's get a picture of the wedding party.

12:54.657 --> 12:58.511
Oh, mom, would you fix your top?
This isn't "playboy."

12:58.589 --> 13:01.584
She's fine. Don't fuss with her.

13:03.641 --> 13:06.636
Kitty, correct me if I'm wrong,

13:06.714 --> 13:12.298
but at a wedding rehearsal, isn't it tradition
for the bride and groom to.. well, you know,

13:12.350 --> 13:14.173
show up?

13:14.356 --> 13:17.793
Red, they will show up.
Everything is just fine.

13:17.871 --> 13:20.397
Eric better have a good reason for being late.

13:20.463 --> 13:24.563
There's only two acceptable excuses
for tardiness in a pinciotti household.

13:24.613 --> 13:27.980
One.. traffic was terrible.

13:28.096 --> 13:31.959
Two.. I should have left earlier, but I was doin' somethin'.

13:32.453 --> 13:34.953
Well, donna's not here either. Oh,

13:34.995 --> 13:37.932
maybe her new house ran out of gas.

13:38.558 --> 13:41.370
I'm sorry I'm late. Oh, good,

13:41.432 --> 13:46.989
They're here. I told you everything would be
fine. Eric and donna are here.

13:47.082 --> 13:49.971
What? No, eric's not with me.

13:50.659 --> 13:52.409
He's not here ?

13:52.452 --> 13:55.515
Oh, maybe he's stuck in traffic.

13:56.223 --> 14:01.265
What traffic? 90% of this town's
population is in this room.

14:02.983 --> 14:06.670
Look, you can't take brooke to chicago.

14:06.754 --> 14:10.128
We're gonna raise our baby
together... here,

14:10.212 --> 14:13.608
- Okay? We had it all figured out.
- Oh, really?

14:13.712 --> 14:16.399
So where were you going to live?

14:16.546 --> 14:21.942
Are you planning to get married?
And who's gonna stay home with the baby?

14:22.192 --> 14:24.588
No, tha..

14:27.046 --> 14:30.213
we figured out other stuff,

14:31.088 --> 14:35.400
like she's gonna be the one that
does the breast-feeding.

14:36.296 --> 14:41.916
And then if someone needs to go bowling, I'll do it.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.125
Now I appreciate your concern,
but I'm gonna do what's best for my kid.

14:47.208 --> 14:52.437
Well, then think, michael. You're going away
to the police academy for the next six months.

14:52.521 --> 14:56.145
You don't have the time to help brooke
raise a baby. I do,

14:56.208 --> 15:02.291
and I have a house and a backyard and an extra bedroom,
and I love brooke more than anything in the world.

15:02.348 --> 15:05.681
How can that not be what's best for her?

15:08.723 --> 15:10.994
So, um...

15:11.057 --> 15:14.411
how's the big argument going?

15:20.724 --> 15:23.619
All right, brooke, um...

15:24.632 --> 15:28.652
your mom and I thought that, um...

15:29.507 --> 15:33.673
maybe since I'm gonna be at police academy, that

15:33.757 --> 15:37.028
you might wanna have the baby in chicago.

15:37.741 --> 15:41.657
You know, just so you have your mom there.

15:41.720 --> 15:43.220
Just for now.

15:44.220 --> 15:49.741
Oh, my god, michael. Thank you so much.

15:49.824 --> 15:53.324
I'll come visit, and it'll be great.

15:53.824 --> 15:55.741
What do you know?

15:56.074 --> 15:58.220
You're a gentleman.

15:58.991 --> 16:01.095
And your daughter's a lady,

16:01.220 --> 16:05.928
all except for the bathroom sex
that resulted in our child.

16:10.782 --> 16:14.793
Kitty, eric is over two hours late.
Let's go home.

16:14.855 --> 16:20.439
He's not late, mr. Forman. He didn't show up
because he doesn't want to marry me.

16:20.543 --> 16:23.397
Hey, you don't know that.

16:23.855 --> 16:27.605
Maybe he's just playing hard to get.

16:29.207 --> 16:32.602
I'm gonna make him pay for this.
I'm not strong,

16:32.665 --> 16:35.665
but I know a lot of ways
to destroy men emotionally.

16:36.227 --> 16:38.561
I can vouch for that.

16:39.061 --> 16:44.415
Okay, okay. Let's just.. let's turn those
frowns upside down. I know.

16:44.457 --> 16:48.352
I know. We'll all go back to my house
and enjoy the mexican fiesta I prepared.

16:48.436 --> 16:53.436
I probably won't serve the tiny wedding cakes,
since nobody's getting married.

16:53.485 --> 16:56.985
But there are three kinds of burritos.

16:58.068 --> 17:02.089
Donna, in troubled times like this,

17:02.152 --> 17:07.652
I have a friend I like to turn to..
gooseberry gloss lipstick.

17:07.734 --> 17:12.339
Nobody can feel sad with full, juicy, red lips.

17:12.402 --> 17:18.944
Okay, no offense,but I don't think your lipstick is
gonna help me, because I am not a superficial jerk!

17:23.714 --> 17:25.589
Better.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.735
How could eric do this to me?

17:29.861 --> 17:34.235
I mean, what kind of a horrible person skips out
on someone they've known their whole life?

17:34.298 --> 17:37.357
I mean, someone they're supposed to love?

17:37.565 --> 17:42.648
Uh-huh. Um, donna, why is your suitcase
in the backseat?

17:42.711 --> 17:48.815
Huh? Oh, I was just.. I don't know.
I thought may.. Hey, I showed up, okay?!

17:55.474 --> 17:58.474
what the hell are we gonna do
with all these bride and groom cookies?

17:58.536 --> 18:00.307
Give me the groom.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.038
Well, did you find eric?

18:11.079 --> 18:15.452
No, and the cruiser's gone.
I also noticed that he took his retainer.

18:17.235 --> 18:19.686
So it's probably gonna be an overnighter.

18:20.884 --> 18:22.811
And I couldn't find him either.

18:22.915 --> 18:27.498
I followed a trail of candy wrappers,
and it just circled back around to me.

18:28.618 --> 18:32.134
Donna, I know how difficult this is for you.

18:32.212 --> 18:36.691
Now I've been with a lot of men in my life..
rich men, poor men..

18:36.769 --> 18:39.493
well, not poor,

18:39.816 --> 18:42.394
upper middle-class.

18:43.253 --> 18:49.373
My point is, none of them ever loved me
the way I know eric loves you.

18:49.503 --> 18:53.968
Well, thanks, pamela, but if eric loved me,
he'd be here right now.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.989
Oh, hey, kitty,

18:57.119 --> 19:01.156
listen, I think I'm just gonna take donna
home and call it a night.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.927
Oh, don't you dare.

19:02.979 --> 19:08.838
We need to act like everything is normal. Keep the party going.
Keep donna happy. Didn't you have a speech to give?

19:08.946 --> 19:12.337
- Kitty, I don't think it's still appropriate..
- Okay, bob's got a speech.

19:12.459 --> 19:16.524
Everybody, listen to bob's speech.
Speech! Speech!

19:16.566 --> 19:21.941
I guess I could change a few things as I go along.

19:22.454 --> 19:27.121
"To the lovely bride and the handsome bride..."

19:28.287 --> 19:33.204
"I know that one of you will make yourself very happy."

19:33.787 --> 19:39.021
"Your life will surely be enriched
by all the time you spend with...

19:39.250 --> 19:41.697
..alone..

19:41.700 --> 19:49.980
"You are truly one soul becoming one
joined... alone forever."

19:50.480 --> 19:54.084
"So I don't look at this as the day I lose
a daughter."

19:54.146 --> 19:56.917
"I look at this as the day I gain...

19:57.458 --> 19:59.458
..nobody."

19:59.521 --> 20:01.438
Salut.

20:12.840 --> 20:14.548
Hello.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.256
Yeah, we kinda figured.

20:19.643 --> 20:21.293
Uh-huh.

20:22.289 --> 20:25.623
Well, do you wanna talk to her? She sittin' right here.

20:26.498 --> 20:27.998
Okay.

20:32.889 --> 20:35.077
Wrong number.

20:37.702 --> 20:40.580
Hyde, what did he say?

20:40.723 --> 20:44.285
- He said he's really sorry.
- He's sorry?

20:45.056 --> 20:48.952
He left me the day before our wedding,
and he's sorry?

20:49.035 --> 20:51.244
What.. what does that mean?

20:51.369 --> 20:53.515
It means he's not coming.

20:54.161 --> 20:59.181
Not tonight, not to the wedding.
He's gone.

21:02.681 --> 21:08.098
Man, I am glad to be here.
I have had a rough day.

21:08.348 --> 21:15.848
Being around all this love and happiness oughta cheer me right up.
I mean, this is a happy day. Look at all the love.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.908
Wait, hey, where's eric?

21:24.958 --> 21:28.047
I can't believe forman took off, man.
That's not like him at all.

21:28.088 --> 21:30.880
Usually he ruins things by staying.

21:31.016 --> 21:36.943
- So, steven, you know, since the church is booked already,
you think maybe we...- No! -...Oh, come on!

21:37.005 --> 21:43.096
Look, eric jilts donna and all you guys can talk about
is yourselves. Well, there are bigger issues here, people.

21:43.138 --> 21:46.034
Donna is single. Whoo-hoo!

21:46.408 --> 21:50.034
Wait a minute. I get it now.
Cockroach beats everything.

21:50.096 --> 21:54.263
Let's play, and I warn you, I'm going to be cockroach.
