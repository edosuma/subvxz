WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:07.549
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:07.632 --> 00:10.260
- What you doing?
- I'm planning dinner tonight.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.512
Uh, the menu is pan-roasted
chicken breast

00:12.595 --> 00:14.180
with orzo in a red wine sauce.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.056
Are we celebrating me
doing something great?

00:16.140 --> 00:18.476
'Cause I do great things
all the time and nothin'.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.563
Rick and his fiancee
are in town

00:21.646 --> 00:23.064
to sign the lease
on their new apartment

00:23.148 --> 00:25.525
and Val has invited them
for dinner.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.943
Isn't that gonna be awkward?

00:27.026 --> 00:29.863
You loving Rick
right in front of his fiancee?

00:29.946 --> 00:31.448
Stop it.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.908
Rick and Julie don't know
a lot of people, so I want to--

00:33.992 --> 00:37.036
Just see if she has
a big ass, right?

00:37.120 --> 00:39.414
Speaking of fiances,
have you guys seen

00:39.497 --> 00:41.332
my engagement ring today?

00:41.416 --> 00:44.252
Hello, Lisa.
Good morning.

00:44.335 --> 00:46.629
- You named your diamond Lisa?
- That's right.

00:46.713 --> 00:49.007
Lisa was this girl in school
who told me I was fat

00:49.090 --> 00:52.469
and would never get married.
Crack ho.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.182
Hey, did you, uh, read my essay?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.976
Oh, no, not yet,
but it is so on my list.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.603
Did you fill out
your application

01:01.686 --> 01:02.854
for the NYU summer program?

01:02.937 --> 01:05.482
Not yet,
but it's so on my list.

01:05.565 --> 01:06.900
I know what you're doing.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.651
You're procrastinating
until it's too late.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.528
I know what you're doing,
you haven't read my essay

01:10.612 --> 01:12.197
because you don't even
wanna think about me

01:12.280 --> 01:13.490
going to Paris for the summer.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.700
- Unh-unh.
- Uh-huh. You're so obvious.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.911
- You're more obvious.
- Well, you're little.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.121
You're untidy.

01:20.205 --> 01:23.166
I don't understand why
you're not being supportive.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.210
Not supportive?
Wait a second.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.170
You decided you didn't
want to go to Columbia

01:27.253 --> 01:29.547
and I wasn't happy,
but I supported it.

01:29.631 --> 01:33.551
And then you got accepted
to NYU and I wept with support.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.428
And now I wanna go to Paris.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.180
And I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.723
You were doing so well.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.102
Holly, do you realize if you do
this summer program, you could

01:43.186 --> 01:45.438
get your math and science
requirements out of the way?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.858
Or I could sew my face
to the carpet.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.778
Come on, I did it and I got out
in three and a half years.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.321
Haven't you always told me
that college is

01:53.404 --> 01:55.156
the most fun experience
of your life?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.449
Yes! Yes.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.785
Then why do you want me
to get out so fast?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.370
It's so much fun
to tell people

02:00.453 --> 02:02.956
you graduated
in three and a half years.

02:03.039 --> 02:04.707
I'm talking about Paris.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.502
I mean, why do you think I spent
four years studying French?

02:07.585 --> 02:10.003
Don't make me waste it
on some French-Canadian.

02:11.297 --> 02:12.715
You're going to be a tour guide.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.260
In Paris. I'll be surrounded
by French culture.

02:15.343 --> 02:18.680
I'll be learning about art,
history and cowardice.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.933
I just think that there are
more productive ways

02:22.016 --> 02:23.768
to spend your summer
than fooling around in Paris.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.729
It's not fooling around.
It's an official internship.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.773
You know what?
I'm taking my essay back.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.818
- You don't even get to read it.
- Fine, turn it in. Good luck.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.904
Well, I don't need your luck
because my essay's kick-ass.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.739
Good for you.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.533
And I'm gonna get
that internship.

02:38.616 --> 02:42.287
I hope you do, and if you do
I will not fight you on it.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.580
Oh, my God.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.540
You don't think
I can get it, do you?

02:45.623 --> 02:47.917
I just want what's best for you.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.878

[instrumental music]

03:36.382 --> 03:38.718
So what do you think?

03:38.801 --> 03:40.929
- I think you're going to Paris.
- Really?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.139
Yeah, the internship people
will love this essay.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.016
Oh, I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.309
I value your opinion so much.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.727
As soon as I was
finished writing it

03:47.810 --> 03:49.479
I was like I have got
to get this to Tina.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.482
She is so smart. She's, like,
the smartest person I know.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.151
- Hey, hey, ladies.
- Hey.

03:55.234 --> 03:57.028
Oh, hey, Henry,
thank you so much for coming.

03:57.111 --> 03:58.404
Yeah, no problem.
Where's the essay?

03:58.488 --> 04:00.239
Right here. I didn't let
anybody else read it.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.533
You're the smartest person
I know.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.161
Let's be real.

04:06.245 --> 04:07.246
Okay, I have a deadline.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.790
It has to be postmarked
by tomorrow.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.917
Okay, that's okay.
Yeah, Kate's out of town.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.377
I'll read it tonight.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.545
So tell them. Tell them
what you told me outside.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.630
No, no, no.
It's no big deal.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.007
- No big deal? Man, it's huge.
- What's huge?

04:19.091 --> 04:22.512
Henry won the Smartest Guy Ever
New York Award.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.389
That's not the exact title.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.809
It's, uh, I-I was selected
as a national merit scholar.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.937
- And tell them the best part.
- Oh, I get to meet Bill Joy.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.356
No, about the cashish.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.316
They're gonna give him,
like, a million dollars.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.526
Ten thousand.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.487
- Ooh, come to Tina.
- Yeah.

04:39.570 --> 04:41.489
- Bill Joy, Henry? Bill Joy?
- Yeah, I know.

04:41.572 --> 04:44.867
- How awesome is that?
- Okay, who's Bill Joy?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.078
He's, like, the Thomas Edison
of the internet

04:47.161 --> 04:48.830
and Henry's hero.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.040
Oh, you remember that?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.418
Did you think I was
just hot for your body?

05:01.759 --> 05:03.970
So when are you guys
actually moving to New York?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.972
Right after the honeymoon
and I'm so dreading it.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.265
The honeymoon?

05:07.348 --> 05:10.143
No, it's just that moving
is so stressful.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.603
Oh, it is stressful,
they say that moving

05:12.687 --> 05:14.605
is one of the most
stressful times in your life.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.607
Second only
to marrying someone.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.486
I meant burying someone.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.779
Yeah, there's nothing
more stressful

05:21.863 --> 05:23.489
than covering up a murder.
More coffee?

05:24.824 --> 05:27.243
So, Jules, how many carats
in that little bauble?

05:27.326 --> 05:28.411
Lauren, some people don't feel--

05:28.494 --> 05:29.954
Three and a half.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.873
Ooh, holy moly.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.417
Hey, um, do you wanna try on
mine and I can try on yours?

05:34.500 --> 05:35.793
No.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.380
[knock on door]
Don't you wanna get that?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.966
Yeah, I thought maybe you could
get it on your way out.

05:45.845 --> 05:48.556
- Oh, hey, Henry.
- Hey. Hey, congratulations.

05:48.639 --> 05:51.684
- I heard you got engaged.
- You didn't finish.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
To a doctor.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.105
Hey, Henry,
did you meet everybody?

05:56.189 --> 05:57.774
- Everybody, this is Henry.
- Hi.

05:57.857 --> 06:00.193
He came over to read my essay
'cause he's supportive

06:00.276 --> 06:02.236
of me going to Paris.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.905
See you guys.

06:05.531 --> 06:06.532
Mmm.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.700
This ice cream is great.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.660
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Don't eat it.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.496
Oh, God.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.331
Is it from a mad cow?

06:14.832 --> 06:16.459
No, no. I forgot this.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.045
Magic chocolate. Yes.

06:19.128 --> 06:20.630
I thought you'd like it.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.507
It's crazy how much
he loves that stuff.

06:22.590 --> 06:25.885
- What is it?
- Magic chocolate.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.471
It's, uh, regular gooey
chocolate at first

06:28.554 --> 06:32.350
and then, two seconds later,
a hard candy shell.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.310
Magic.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.978
I guess they don't
have that in Houston.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.397
What are you talking about?
They have it everywhere.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.691
I once had it in Chile.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.153
So why don't you ever
have it at home?

06:44.237 --> 06:46.155
Because you don't allow
ice cream around the house

06:46.239 --> 06:49.534
and without the ice cream,
it can't make the shell.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.453
You don't like ice cream?
What is the matter with you?

06:54.122 --> 06:56.290
I don't wanna get fat.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.420
You know, I couldn't
even look at magic chocolate

07:01.504 --> 07:02.505
for, like, two years

07:02.588 --> 07:04.757
after the giant-size "X-Men"
incident.

07:04.841 --> 07:08.219
Oh, yeah,
that was a bad day.

07:08.302 --> 07:11.722
I dripped some magic chocolate
on his comic books.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.975
You should have seen his face.
I mean, I'm sure you've seen it.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.519
God forbid you touch
his comic books, right?

07:16.602 --> 07:19.313
Oh, you collected comic books?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.066
I collect comic books.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.946
- You never told me that.
- Well, yeah, I think I did.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.574
Well, then,
why don't I remember it?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.534
Well, you know, sometimes
you get kinda caught up

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
in not listening to me.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.668
[laughs]

07:46.632 --> 07:49.886
So what'd you think?
Did you like my essay?

07:49.969 --> 07:53.472
It's good.
It's really good.

07:53.556 --> 07:57.810
I mean, really, really good.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.522
There's a, a lot
of good stuff in here.

08:01.606 --> 08:07.153
Five pages of really
good, good stuff.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.823
Good job, Holly.

08:10.907 --> 08:13.618
Hey, listen,
this is really important.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.827
You have to be honest

08:14.911 --> 08:16.829
and if you didn't like it,
I need to know.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.789
Well, it's not
that I didn't like it.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.085
It's just I didn't really
get a sense of, of, um..

08:23.169 --> 08:26.255
Okay, these people are probably
gonna wanna get an idea

08:26.339 --> 08:29.592
of who you are, you know,
and this could be anybody.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.385
Can you be more specific?
Where doesn't it sound like me?

08:32.470 --> 08:33.638
Can you at least give me a page?

08:33.721 --> 08:38.267
Uh, one through five.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.684
You know what? You don't know
what you're talking about.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.520
You've changed since
you got that smart award.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.105
Okay, well,
I'm gonna get going.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.066
Wait, where are you going?
You read this crap.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.776
Can't you see I'm desperate?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.863
Okay, I think
I would have remembered

08:50.947 --> 08:53.991
if you told me you still
have one baby tooth.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.953
You know, Julie, it's just that
we went to high school together

08:57.036 --> 08:59.288
and I don't forget anything.
I'm like an elephant.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.708
Hardly, you're, like,
the furthest thing

09:02.792 --> 09:06.295
from an elephant, which I know
you didn't tell me.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.797
Thanks again for dinner.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.800
And thanks for remembering
to leave the cilantro out.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.594
Since when don't you
like cilantro?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.101
She is lovely.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.985
Okay, I'm coming to the last
paragraph. Are you bored yet?

09:29.068 --> 09:31.654
I'm not bored at all.
It's great. Keep going.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.114
Okay.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.658
"And finally, I guess
my biggest selling point

09:35.741 --> 09:38.202
"for being a tour guide
is that I'm loud.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.497
I can out-loud
those loud American tourists."

09:42.873 --> 09:44.083
That's funny.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.502
It's honest.
It totally sounds like you.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.837
You don't think
it's too jokey

09:47.920 --> 09:49.255
like I'm not
taking it seriously?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.507
No, it's great.
Don't touch it.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.801
- Don't do anything else to it.
- Really?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.970
- Really.
- Oh, thank you so much.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.555
I couldn't have done this
without you.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.348
- You did it without me.
- I know.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.684
But you told me all the stuff
that was great about me.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.146
I mean, I had no idea
I did so many cute things.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.148
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, okay.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.692
Well, thanks again.
You're the best.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.529
[clears throat]
Oh, is that my <i> linge?</i>

10:13.612 --> 10:16.324
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you not understand that?

10:16.407 --> 10:21.120
I said laundry in French,
the language spoken in Paris

10:21.203 --> 10:23.372
where I'll be spending
the summer.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.333
You know, they don't
have "Fear Factor" there.

10:25.416 --> 10:26.542
What?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.838
God, I'm gonna miss
your playful sense of humor

10:30.921 --> 10:33.132
when I'm in the city of lights.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.301
Oh, if you're wondering who
I was just on the phone with

10:35.384 --> 10:37.511
it was one of the number one
scholars in the nation

10:37.595 --> 10:39.013
who loved my essay.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.558
Okay. I never said I didn't want
you to go to Paris, I said--

10:42.641 --> 10:43.976
That you want me
to hurry up and go to college

10:44.060 --> 10:45.394
so I can hurry up and get out.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.563
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go hurry up

10:47.646 --> 10:50.191
and print out
my five page ticket to <i> Paris.</i>

10:55.154 --> 10:56.864
Oh, God. Oh, God.

10:56.947 --> 11:00.284
- What happened?
- Where is it? Where is it?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.914
It's gone. It disappeared.
My essay's gone.

11:04.997 --> 11:08.000
- No, it can't be.
- It's gone.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.211
What did you do?

11:22.932 --> 11:26.519
- Here, man. This is for you.
- What's this for?

11:26.602 --> 11:29.355
Well, you got your award thing
this afternoon, right?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.731
And there are gonna
be people there

11:30.815 --> 11:32.066
taking pictures of you
for the paper.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.317
- Yeah.
- Well..

11:33.401 --> 11:34.819
We just got these
new jackets in at the store.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.112
I wanted my boy to look sharp.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.989
Hey, that's really,
that's really cool, man.

11:39.073 --> 11:41.117
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, my treat.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.995
- Well, thanks, man.
- That's no problem.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.581
Hey, and maybe after
you pick up your 10,000

11:47.665 --> 11:49.458
you can thank old Gary
with one of those

11:49.542 --> 11:52.002
George Foreman grills.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.796
Red.

11:53.879 --> 11:56.298
[cell phone rings]

11:56.382 --> 11:58.050
- Hello?
- 'I'm screwed, Henry.'

11:58.134 --> 12:00.886
(Holly)
'I lost my essay
and I don't know where it is.'

12:00.970 --> 12:04.014
- Tell Holly I said hi.
- Wait, wait, wait.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.142
What do you mean you lost it?
Didn't you back it up?

12:06.225 --> 12:08.811
(Holly)
'Of course, I backed it up.
What do you think I am, stupid?'

12:08.894 --> 12:11.772
Okay, okay,
calm down, calm down.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.607
I'm gonna walk you
through it, okay?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.819
You need to press option F and
type in the name of your file.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.779
(Holly)
'I don't know
the name of the file.'

12:18.863 --> 12:20.614
How can you not know
the name of your file?

12:20.698 --> 12:24.326
(Holly)
'Because I don't. I'm not
a wizard, I'm a person.'

12:24.410 --> 12:25.995
I'm gonna have to go over there.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.997
But what about your thing?
What about your award thing?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.498
Uh, I still got an hour.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.001
I'm sure she just saved it
to another file. I'll find it.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.794
Oh, thanks again
for the jacket, man.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.922
Hey, you're my friend
and I'm real proud of you.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.842
Just don't sweat in it and you
might wanna leave on those tags.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.429
[instrumental music]

12:47.475 --> 12:49.852
Okay. No, come on up.

12:51.187 --> 12:53.022
That was Rick.
He's on his way up.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.273
He said he wants to talk
to me about something.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.774
He sounded kind of weird.

12:55.858 --> 12:57.359
I know what he wants
to talk about.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.445
He realized
his fiancee is gross

12:59.528 --> 13:01.697
and he wants
to be engaged to you.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.493
Okay, first of all,
his fiancee is not gross.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.661
She's under
a lot of stress right now.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.288
She's moving,
she's planning a wedding.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.832
She just met
her fiance's old girlfriend

13:11.916 --> 13:13.709
so you know,
she snapped like a psycho.

13:13.792 --> 13:16.212
[knock on door]

13:16.295 --> 13:17.796
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.298
Hope you don't mind me
dropping by.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.050
No, no. Come on in.

13:22.510 --> 13:25.596
- You okay?
- Yeah, I was just up all night.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.057
- Can I talk to you?
- Oh, yeah.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.308
Why don't we go outside?

13:29.391 --> 13:31.519
Okay. Just let me
get my jacket.

13:44.823 --> 13:45.991
Do you wanna sit down?

13:46.075 --> 13:48.661
Yeah, no,
it won't take that long.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.079
Julie's actually
waiting for me.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.956
Oh, why didn't you
have her come up?

13:52.039 --> 13:54.208
Well, that's kind of the thing.

13:54.291 --> 13:56.168
- She hates me.
- No, she doesn't hate you.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.420
She's just, she's,
she's just kind of..

13:58.504 --> 14:01.465
She's just a big baby
is what she is.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.759
And, and she's wrong.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.844
About what?

14:05.928 --> 14:10.766
She doesn't want us to have any
more contact with each other.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.352
- Ever.
- What?

14:13.435 --> 14:16.939
Well, last night she said
she was picking up some vibe.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.607
Vibe? What kind of vibe?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.277
Uh, a, a vibe between..

14:21.360 --> 14:23.237
- Us?
- You know.. Yeah..

14:23.320 --> 14:24.613
There's no vibe between us.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.740
That's what I told her,
you know?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.701
Like, over and over again
last night.

14:28.784 --> 14:29.910
You know, I said
we were just friends.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.620
That is,
we are just friends.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.789
Yeah, and whatever vibe
she was picking up

14:33.872 --> 14:35.374
was just, you know,
two old friends

14:35.457 --> 14:36.959
who were really comfortable
with each other.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.127
Yeah, that's all it was.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.378
Yeah, that's all it was.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.130
- We have a history.
- We have a past.

14:41.213 --> 14:43.757
We know things about each other
that no one else would know.

14:43.841 --> 14:46.427
It's just crazy
that she sensed something.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.553
It's insane.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.430
- It's ridiculous.
- Yeah.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.027
I'm sorry.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.737
I'm sorry. Ahem.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.488
I think I've been wanting
to do that

15:06.572 --> 15:08.657
since the day I ran into you
at the diner.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.784
You, you,
that was, we would..

15:10.868 --> 15:13.162
Oh, I'm getting married
in a month.

15:13.245 --> 15:15.414
Yeah, you know what this was?

15:15.497 --> 15:18.709
This was the goodbye kiss
that we never had.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.169
Yes, yes.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.838
Yeah, when we were
in high school and we broke up

15:22.921 --> 15:23.964
you know,
it was never really official.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.466
We just sort of faded out.

15:25.549 --> 15:29.053
But now it's official.
We can just both move on.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.682
And that is what
I think we should both do.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.809
We should just move on

15:35.893 --> 15:39.647
and, uh, never have any contact
with each other, ever.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.569
The, the thing is,
you know..

15:45.653 --> 15:48.113
...Julie can be sometimes
a little insecure

15:48.197 --> 15:49.823
but I, I do love her.

15:49.907 --> 15:51.283
Of course you do.

15:52.826 --> 15:57.498
And I hope that you and Julie
have a great everything.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.800
[instrumental music]

16:16.767 --> 16:18.560
I'm never gonna find it.
We're running out of time.

16:18.644 --> 16:19.728
It's got to be postmarked today.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.522
Stop it.
You're being very negative.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.441
You can't say that until
we've tried everything possible.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.112
We've now tried
everything possible.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.114
- It's not there.
- I knew it.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.949
No, no, no!

16:32.032 --> 16:34.201
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:34.284 --> 16:35.869
I think your hard drive crashed.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.454
It's really bizarre. I don't
know if it was a virus--

16:37.538 --> 16:40.916
I have my old essay.
It wasn't that bad, was it?

16:40.999 --> 16:44.253
There was some really
good stuff in there.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.089
Really, really good, Holly.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.632
Oh, crap.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.259
Well, what if
you write it again?

16:50.342 --> 16:52.302
No, I'll never be able
to remember everything.

16:52.386 --> 16:54.930
Plus, I had it perfect
and if I write it now

16:55.013 --> 16:57.725
it'll be all filled
with hatred and bitterness.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.729
But you heard it.
You can help me.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.605
Uh, no, no, I can't.

17:03.689 --> 17:04.982
Yeah, I read
the whole thing to you.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.525
You can help me remember
the things I forgot.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.109
No, no, really, Holly,
I, I can't.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.404
Please, Henry,
I really, really want this.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.739
I know, but I can't.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.281
Listen,
it's the biggest thing

17:13.365 --> 17:15.117
I've ever had
the chance to do.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.368
Before I start four years
of college, I wanna go.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.746
I wanna see what's out there.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.372
I wanna see
if I can do it on my own.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.665
But I can't do it
on my own without you.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.377
Please, Henry. I need you.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.049
Are you gonna help me?

17:31.133 --> 17:32.301
Yeah, I'm gonna help you.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.344
Oh, Henry,
thank you so much.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.930
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.057
- Really, thank you.
- Yeah.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.643
- Well, it's almost 5 o'clock.
- Yeah. I know what time it is.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.270
It's gotta be postmarked today
and the post office closes--

17:43.353 --> 17:44.938
Don't worry about it.
We'll make it.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.106
Oh, you forgot
to take the tags out.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.483
Oh!

17:55.616 --> 17:57.034
- Hi.
- Hello.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.704
I got you a little something.

18:00.788 --> 18:02.790
- For what?
- Open it.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.669
Oh, I guess mine
is coming tomorrow.

18:10.589 --> 18:13.217
- Paris?
- No, that one is for me.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.720
- This one's for you.
- New York?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.847
Yeah, it's for you to look at

18:18.931 --> 18:20.516
when you're missing me
in Paris

18:20.599 --> 18:23.101
and this is for me to look at
when I'm missing you here.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.437
Aww.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.482
Thank you, but I didn't
get accepted yet.

18:28.565 --> 18:29.858
You will.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.736
I read the essay you
accidentally left on my pillow.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.823
Oh, thank you, Val.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.157
[knock on door]

18:37.241 --> 18:38.867
- Hey, ready to go?
- Yes, let's go.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.537
- Where are you guys going?
- To the diner to meet Henry.

18:41.620 --> 18:42.871
I'm gonna buy him
anything he wants

18:42.955 --> 18:44.289
after what he did
for me yesterday.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.624
Yeah, I knew
he'd find your file.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.251
- The guy's a genius.
- No, he didn't find it.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.877
My computer crashed,
so he helped me rewrite

18:48.961 --> 18:50.754
the whole thing and then he went
with me to the post office

18:50.838 --> 18:52.422
to mail it. How great is he?

18:52.506 --> 18:54.258
Wait, what about his
scholar award thing?

18:54.341 --> 18:55.509
What about it?

18:55.592 --> 18:57.344
Well, his appointment
was 5 o'clock yesterday.

18:57.427 --> 18:58.720
No way. He was with me
at 5 o'clock.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.639
He didn't say anything about..

19:02.558 --> 19:05.060
Oh, my God. I have to go.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.562
Can you believe he did that?

19:06.645 --> 19:07.855
Especially after I bought him

19:07.938 --> 19:09.857
that gorgeous
brown suede jacket.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.568
Gorgeous?

19:12.651 --> 19:13.944
Gay.

19:16.071 --> 19:17.573
[instrumental music]

19:22.452 --> 19:25.038
- Hey.
- What did you do?

19:25.122 --> 19:26.582
I don't know.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.041
I'm gonna need
a little bit more data.

19:28.125 --> 19:31.670
Was your awards dinner
yesterday at 5 o'clock?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.589
- Okay, look--
- How could you do that?

19:33.672 --> 19:34.965
You were gonna get
your picture in the paper

19:35.048 --> 19:36.383
and you were gonna
meet your idol.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.136
- Yeah, but you--
- Why didn't you tell me?

19:39.219 --> 19:42.014
Come here, listen, come here.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.308
You know, it's not like
I gave up the award.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.684
I'm still gonna get the money

19:45.767 --> 19:48.687
and one of these days,
I'll meet Bill Joy.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.105
Yeah, but it was
such a big deal

19:50.188 --> 19:52.190
and I know how important
it was to you.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.567
Yeah, but so are you.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.235
You know, just 'cause
we're not together

19:55.319 --> 19:57.779
doesn't mean I don't want
good things to happen for you.

19:59.239 --> 20:02.367
You know what, Henry?
You're incredible.

20:02.451 --> 20:05.621
- Ah.
- Sometimes I wonder--

20:05.704 --> 20:09.041
Kate? Hey. Oh, my gosh.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.754
You weren't supposed to
be back till tomorrow.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.714
I couldn't wait.
I missed you too much.

20:15.797 --> 20:18.300
I missed you too.
Come on. Are you hungry?

20:18.383 --> 20:21.219
- Mm, not really.
- Me neither.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.348
Hey, Holly.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.141
Oh, uh,
we're cool, right, Holly?

20:26.224 --> 20:28.226
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.274
- Where's he going?
- Somewhere with Kate.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.776
That was really awesome
what he did for you.

20:35.859 --> 20:38.612
I know.
He's unbelievable, isn't he?

20:42.741 --> 20:44.993
Oh, my God.
Tell me you're not..

20:48.080 --> 20:49.539
Gary!
