biggest snobs

08:32.440 --> 08:33.568
and cuntiest critics,

08:33.568 --> 08:35.029
and I just feel like
they hate it.

08:35.029 --> 08:36.198
Do they hate it?

08:36.198 --> 08:38.327
‐ I think‐‐
I think people like it.

08:38.327 --> 08:39.872
‐ Have you seen Sheila?

08:39.872 --> 08:41.834
Is‐‐is she looking
at me right now?

08:41.834 --> 08:43.588
‐ Oh, I don't know
where she is.

08:43.588 --> 08:46.426
I‐‐I would say
don't over‐think it.

08:47.888 --> 08:51.019
‐ Annie, you brought
a distro guy as your date?

08:51.019 --> 08:52.105
‐ Oh, yeah.

08:52.105 --> 08:53.984
Well, he's, um...

08:53.984 --> 08:56.071
‐ I mean, I'm her boyfriend,
actually.

08:56.071 --> 08:58.117
‐ Oh, I get this.
I get this.

08:58.117 --> 08:59.829
Sheila will think
I'm not a fucking snob

08:59.829 --> 09:01.456
in my ivory tower.

09:01.456 --> 09:02.585
I know all my employees.

09:02.585 --> 09:03.795
I'm a man of the people.

09:03.795 --> 09:06.341
I‐‐I'm Mother Teresa,
but less of a bitch.

09:06.341 --> 09:07.970
‐ Yes.
‐ This is a nice move, Annie.

09:07.970 --> 09:09.932
‐ Yeah.
‐ Okay, you guys get out there

09:09.932 --> 09:11.894
and just dazzle
these motherfuckers, okay?

09:11.894 --> 09:13.898
And stay ordinary.

09:15.819 --> 09:19.117
‐ Okay, I'm gonna go to the bar
and get us a drink,

09:19.117 --> 09:21.330
and then we're gonna go
to Burger League, right?

09:21.330 --> 09:24.879
‐ Well, maybe not that quick,
but yes.

09:24.879 --> 09:26.423
‐ Okay, I'm gonna get you
that pink wine.

09:26.423 --> 09:28.762
‐ Okay, rosé, but yep.

09:31.224 --> 09:32.561
Oh.

09:32.561 --> 09:34.189
AMADI: Hey.
ANNIE: Gabe is going insane.

09:34.189 --> 09:35.984
You're exactly right.
He's freaking out.

09:35.984 --> 09:38.865
Sorry.
‐ Oh, hey, Annie, this is Nick.

09:38.865 --> 09:40.368
Nick's probably
the best illustrator

09:40.368 --> 09:42.163
who's ever lived in Portland.
ANNIE: Oh.

09:42.163 --> 09:45.044
‐ Oh, he did that summer cover
that you like, on your cubicle.

09:45.044 --> 09:46.421
‐ Wow, wait, that was you?

09:46.421 --> 09:48.008
The dog in the bikini?

09:48.008 --> 09:50.847
That's, like, my favorite cover
we had all year.

09:50.847 --> 09:52.433
‐ That's my dog.
ANNIE: What?

09:52.433 --> 09:53.895
‐ Yeah, Popcorn.
‐ Wow.

09:53.895 --> 09:55.565
‐ She was the model
for that one, so...

09:55.565 --> 09:57.986
‐ So you live
with Popcorn the model?

09:57.986 --> 09:59.114
Sounds kind of intimidating.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.617
‐ I mean, it's quite a life,
you know?

10:00.617 --> 10:02.746
16‐pound model
running around your apartment.

10:02.746 --> 10:05.000
‐ Ooh, yeah.
‐ Recently ate a dead bird.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.420
‐ Well, that's my kind of girl.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.006
‐ I'll hook you guys up.
‐ Cool.

10:08.006 --> 10:09.593
NICK: Yeah.

10:11.973 --> 10:12.975
MAUREEN: Maureen.

10:12.975 --> 10:15.271
TONY:
Maureen, oh, my God.

10:15.271 --> 10:17.526
When I said
subtle aromatic au jus,

10:17.526 --> 10:19.028
was I just jerking myself off?

10:19.028 --> 10:20.574
'Cause this smells like piss.

10:20.574 --> 10:23.747
‐ Sir, on my honor
as a part‐time catering worker,

10:23.747 --> 10:26.586
I can assure you that
there is no urine in that food.

10:26.586 --> 10:27.546
TONY: Just...

10:27.546 --> 10:30.510
Oh, hi!

10:30.510 --> 10:32.263
‐ I'm, like,
settled in for the night.

10:32.263 --> 10:36.564
I wake up mid‐flight
fully hallucinating.

10:36.564 --> 10:38.108
The hit's, like,
fully taken hold.

10:38.108 --> 10:40.112
I'm, like...I don't know
what's going on.

10:40.112 --> 10:41.364
I think the flight
attendants are, like,

10:41.364 --> 10:42.785
skeletons coming for me.
‐ No!

10:42.785 --> 10:44.872
‐ I'm ready to, like,
jump out of my seat.

10:44.872 --> 10:46.124
Yeah.
‐ That's my nightmare.

10:46.124 --> 10:48.462
‐ It was horrifying.
Horrifying.

10:48.462 --> 10:50.967
‐ God.
‐ Whoa.

10:50.967 --> 10:53.388
‐ Hey, Nick, this is Ryan.
Ryan, Nick.

10:53.388 --> 10:55.309
‐ Sorry, what's your name?
NICK: Hm?

10:55.309 --> 10:56.813
‐ What's your name?
NICK: Nick.

10:56.813 --> 11:00.236
‐ Hey, Nick.
Ryan.

11:00.236 --> 11:03.450
‐ Yeah, you know, um,
Gabe told me to, like, mingle,

11:03.450 --> 11:04.537
and I do want to,

11:04.537 --> 11:06.039
so I really
want to meet Sheila.

11:06.039 --> 11:07.375
That's...

11:07.375 --> 11:08.586
that's Sheila, right?

11:08.586 --> 11:10.130
NICK: Yeah,
that's her right over there.

11:10.130 --> 11:12.176
I can introduce you,
if you want.

11:12.176 --> 11:13.178
Kind of makes it easier.

11:13.178 --> 11:14.264
‐ Really?

11:14.264 --> 11:15.767
Yeah.
I mean, I would love that.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.565
I don't know if I've had enough
wine at this point, but...

11:18.565 --> 11:20.527
‐ No, she's totally not scary.

11:20.527 --> 11:22.614
I've been working for her
for, like, ten years.

11:22.614 --> 11:24.994
‐ Yeah,
I'm very star‐struck by her.

11:24.994 --> 11:26.288
Would you mind, Amadi,

11:26.288 --> 11:27.958
if I left Ryan with you
for just a minute?

11:27.958 --> 11:29.043
‐ Yeah, that's cool.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.462
ANNIE: You're good,
right, Ryan?

11:30.462 --> 11:32.759
‐ Yeah, sure.
Okay.

11:35.557 --> 11:37.143
You know about Alcatraz?

11:37.143 --> 11:38.478
‐ The prison?

11:38.478 --> 11:40.609
‐ Yeah, but originally,
it was a military base.

11:40.609 --> 11:41.861
Did you know that?

11:41.861 --> 11:43.363
‐ I didn't know that.
‐ Yeah, well, it's true.

11:43.363 --> 11:46.286
‐ I need to show you something.

11:48.248 --> 11:50.044
You should stay
down here and die.

11:55.429 --> 11:57.684
CHRIS: Sheila!
‐ Hi, Chris!

12:02.109 --> 12:03.111
NICK: Wait right here.

12:03.111 --> 12:04.280
Perfect.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.076
‐ Now we're just
gonna have a conversation.

12:06.076 --> 12:07.203
Okay, you're gonna pretend
to talk to me.

12:07.203 --> 12:08.790
ANNIE: Yeah.
‐ Don't look back at her.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.042
‐ Okay.
‐ Stay right here with me.

12:10.042 --> 12:11.378
‐ Okay.
NICK: And as soon as she's done

12:11.378 --> 12:13.883
talking to this guy,
we're gonna make our move.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.260
ANNIE: Okay.
‐ Don't‐‐no, no.

12:15.260 --> 12:16.597
Stay right here.
SHEILA: I'd love to.

12:16.597 --> 12:18.058
Let's set it up.
‐ Okay, it's almost time.

12:18.058 --> 12:19.060
CHRIS: Yeah, sure.
Congratulations.

12:19.060 --> 12:20.062
NICK: Okay, now laugh.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.064
[both laugh]

12:21.064 --> 12:22.066
Okay, let's go.

12:24.404 --> 12:26.951
‐ Oh, hey, Nick Powell.
I was hoping I'd see you here.

12:26.951 --> 12:28.120
‐ Sheila,
I want to introduce you

12:28.120 --> 12:29.832
to one of your star employees.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.794
SHEILA: All right.
‐ This is Annie Easton.

12:31.794 --> 12:32.963
ANNIE: Hi.

12:32.963 --> 12:34.591
‐ "Hello, I'm fat."

12:34.591 --> 12:37.221
Oh, my God.
That piece blew my mind.

12:37.221 --> 12:40.102
‐ Oh. Oh, my God.
You saw that?

12:40.102 --> 12:44.778
‐ Yes. In fact,
I sent it to my mom, actually.

12:44.778 --> 12:47.743
I mean, that mind prison shit,
that is real.

12:47.743 --> 12:50.039
‐ Yeah, so real.

12:50.039 --> 12:52.168
God, I honestly
can't believe you read it.

12:52.168 --> 12:53.546
‐ I mean, of course I read it.

12:53.546 --> 12:55.592
It shattered
our traffic records.

12:55.592 --> 12:59.015
Gabe said you went rogue
when you posted it.

12:59.015 --> 13:02.188
‐ I‐‐I did, yeah.

13:02.188 --> 13:05.194
‐ You know, as your publisher,
I should probably

13:05.194 --> 13:07.156
tell you
you should never do that again.

13:08.283 --> 13:09.787
But we're off the clock,
so fuck it.

13:09.787 --> 13:11.999
I loved it!
ANNIE: Oh, wow.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.460
Ma'am, you have to stop.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.130
Like, this is too much
for me to take.

13:15.130 --> 13:16.257
It's so nice.

13:16.257 --> 13:18.513
‐ She's adorable.
Where'd you find her?

13:18.513 --> 13:22.604
‐ Well, gulp, gulp, gulp.
But, you know.

13:26.862 --> 13:28.658
‐ Ta‐da!

13:28.658 --> 13:30.035
‐ Holy shit.

13:30.035 --> 13:31.622
What is this?

13:31.622 --> 13:34.545
‐ It's a gas mask collection.

13:34.545 --> 13:35.547
[laughs]

13:35.547 --> 13:36.841
I just hung it up.

13:36.841 --> 13:37.968
Some of these date
all the way back

13:37.968 --> 13:40.640
to World War...eight?

13:40.640 --> 13:41.642
Yeah?

13:41.642 --> 13:42.727
Yeah, that sounds right.

13:42.727 --> 13:44.690
‐ Hey, Ruthie, you live here?

13:44.690 --> 13:46.569
‐ Yeah, I've lived here
for two years.

13:46.569 --> 13:48.321
This is my room.

13:48.321 --> 13:50.075
Do you like
how I've arranged them?

13:50.075 --> 13:51.954
The ones that had people
die in them most recently

13:51.954 --> 13:53.415
are closest to my bed.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.587
‐ Yeah, um, that's nice.

13:55.587 --> 13:57.256
It's just,
don't you think it's unusual

13:57.256 --> 13:58.926
that you live
with Tony and Gabe?

13:58.926 --> 14:01.180
‐ No. I needed a place to stay,

14:01.180 --> 14:03.435
and they needed
a beautiful teen daughter

14:03.435 --> 14:04.521
with huge, rockin' tits.

14:04.521 --> 14:06.942
‐ Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just...

14:06.942 --> 14:09.280
I'm, like, thrown
by this whole arrangement.

14:10.992 --> 14:12.662
‐ Well, it's weird
you're not thrown

14:12.662 --> 14:14.625
that you have an alcoholic wife
that only fucks you

14:14.625 --> 14:15.835
when you make money.

14:15.835 --> 14:18.381
‐ Hey, whoa, wait.
Ruthie...

14:18.381 --> 14:20.929
Okay, look, hey,
I'm sorry if I offended you.

14:20.929 --> 14:22.933
I wasn't trying
to get you upset.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.060
I'm just asking questions.

14:24.060 --> 14:26.314
‐ Well, you didn't
get me upset.

14:26.314 --> 14:28.318
But I'm sure your mom's upset,

14:28.318 --> 14:30.364
screaming in hell
because her son fucking sucks

14:30.364 --> 14:32.619
and he's a piece of shit
and he's an asshole.

14:32.619 --> 14:34.539
‐ Ruthie.

14:34.539 --> 14:37.837
‐ Have you done any freelance
stuff outside of Portland?

14:37.837 --> 14:39.006
‐ Oh, no.

14:39.006 --> 14:40.384
I mean, I would love to,

14:40.384 --> 14:42.429
but I was doing the calendar

14:42.429 --> 14:44.141
up to, like, two months ago,
so...

14:44.141 --> 14:45.394
‐ Oh, well, you should.

14:45.394 --> 14:47.356
I mean, you should
get a feel of, you know,

14:47.356 --> 14:49.443
working with a variety
of editors.

14:49.443 --> 14:50.947
Let me know
if you want to pitch something

14:50.947 --> 14:52.449
to one of my other papers.

14:52.449 --> 14:53.619
‐ Oh, my God.
I would love that.

14:53.619 --> 14:56.625
That would be amazing.

14:56.625 --> 15:00.424
I mean, if Gabe's okay with it,
then yeah.

15:02.136 --> 15:03.346
‐ Hey, Annie,

15:03.346 --> 15:05.893
do you mind if I give you
a piece of advice?

15:05.893 --> 15:07.939
‐ Of course.
It would be my honor.

15:07.939 --> 15:10.820
‐ Gabe is truly the best
at what he does.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.035
He's brilliant,
but he's a narcissist,

15:14.035 --> 15:16.915
so it may seem
like he's helping you,

15:16.915 --> 15:20.005
but at the end of the day,
he's looking out for himself.

15:20.005 --> 15:23.261
So you need to look out
for yourself too.

15:24.096 --> 15:25.474
‐ Yeah.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.442
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

15:30.442 --> 15:32.029
Totally.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.200
‐ So, you know,
as you develop your voice

15:34.200 --> 15:35.410
as a writer‐‐
‐ Hello, there.

15:35.410 --> 15:36.997
ANNIE: Hi.
‐ Just checking on my girl.

15:36.997 --> 15:38.667
ANNIE: Hey.
RYAN: How we doing on time?

15:38.667 --> 15:40.797
‐ Oh, yeah, good.
Um...

15:41.632 --> 15:43.761
Yeah, Sheila, this is Ryan.

15:43.761 --> 15:46.265
‐ Oh, hey.
I'm Annie's burger.

15:46.265 --> 15:47.727
I mean, boyfriend.

15:48.521 --> 15:50.357
[gong clangs]

15:50.357 --> 15:53.906
‐ Ladies and gentlemen,
dinner is served.

15:53.906 --> 15:57.371
‐ [sighs]
Well, excuse me.

15:57.371 --> 15:59.083
ANNIE: Yeah.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.755
I‐‐I can't believe
you just touched my ass

16:01.755 --> 16:03.341
in front of Sheila.

16:03.341 --> 16:05.053
And also,
you interrupted something

16:05.053 --> 16:06.598
that was kind of important.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.980
‐ Okay, sorry.
God.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.399
ANNIE: Okay, I'm sorry.

16:11.399 --> 16:12.902
I'm not trying
to make you feel bad.

16:12.902 --> 16:14.656
I just...

16:14.656 --> 16:17.452
you know, this is almost over,
and then we can go, right?

16:17.452 --> 16:19.875
And now it's time for dinner.
You love dinner.

16:19.875 --> 16:20.918
‐ I do like dinner.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.964
‐ Yeah, okay.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.638
‐ Hey, Annie.

16:26.638 --> 16:28.433
I saw you talking to Sheila.

16:28.433 --> 16:31.523
Did she say anything about me?

16:31.523 --> 16:33.193
‐ Uh, no.
Nothing.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.197
‐ God damn it.

16:35.197 --> 16:38.328

You want to hook up, don't you?

Well, you should know
I'm married.

17:00.998 --> 17:03.253
I just wanted to apologize

17:03.253 --> 17:05.090

out or something.
