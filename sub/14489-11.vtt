But the money's
not invisible.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.016
If the Mafia sees stacks
of cash floating out,

14:09.099 --> 14:11.685
won't they shoot first
and ask questions later?

14:12.269 --> 14:14.605
Not if Zoidberg
eats the money.

14:14.772 --> 14:17.107
Everything he swallows
turns invisible.

14:17.358 --> 14:18.942
Like so.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.988
Then later we just retrieve
it at our convenience.

14:23.155 --> 14:27.868
Hold on, that much cash would
weigh over 300 pounds.

14:28.202 --> 14:30.204
How can Zoidberg walk out
with that much weight?

14:30.454 --> 14:33.499
And he may be invisible,
but he's not insmellable.

14:33.624 --> 14:35.667
He stinks like
the inside of a Tauntaun.

14:35.793 --> 14:37.878
Won't someone
notice the stench?

14:38.045 --> 14:40.047
No, and to keep you
on your toes,

14:40.130 --> 14:43.342
I'll explain why only
after the heist has begun.

Ew.

It ain't my gambling diaper.
ljustchangedit Must be the shrimp.

15:12.413 --> 15:15.416
It's working. Zoidberg,
what are you doing?

15:15.666 --> 15:17.584
Sorry,
I'm just so hungry.

15:17.960 --> 15:22.548
Don't spoil your appetite. You need

Stop griping.
Now get in there,

16:06.049 --> 16:08.385
and remember,
eat everything in the safe,

16:08.719 --> 16:10.721

the little metal box.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.890
That's the most
valuable thing of all.

hold the land for 100 years,
