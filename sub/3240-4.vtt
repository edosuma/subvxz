How'd she treat you?
Poorly at first.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.356
She was old, angry,

30:26.358 --> 30:28.959
But someone
had to take care of her.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.794
<i>No one else would.</i>

30:30.796 --> 30:33.130
<i>Marta, take me through</i>

30:33.132 --> 30:35.966
The night gloria died,
step by step.

30:35.968 --> 30:39.436
It was like any other.
Dinner was served at 5:00.

30:39.438 --> 30:42.673
I helped dress her for the party
at half past.

30:42.675 --> 30:45.309
She was cold,
so I made her a fire.

30:45.311 --> 30:46.877
A fire?

30:46.879 --> 30:48.812
<i>While she was dressing...</i>
<i>The sun was still out.</i>

30:48.814 --> 30:50.380
It was warm, mid-80s.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.983
A fire would have been
unbearable.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.552
Something doesn't fit.
We have to go there.

30:55.554 --> 30:57.487
Conrad's not gonna
let us in.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.090
It's not his anymore.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.694
Ray: Be careful
with those boxes.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.730

mr. Berkowitz.

31:06.732 --> 31:09.733
Excuse me.
Who are you?

31:09.735 --> 31:11.501
Um, detective martinez,

31:11.503 --> 31:13.337
Where's gloria carlyle's
bedroom?

31:13.339 --> 31:15.739
Upstairs.
Master suite.

31:15.741 --> 31:16.506
Great.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.942
Touch nothing!

31:22.146 --> 31:24.314
Marta said gloria
was cold.

31:24.316 --> 31:25.682
She wanted a fire.

31:25.684 --> 31:28.018
Older people
get cold, henry.

31:28.020 --> 31:32.055
I think there
was another reason.

31:46.838 --> 31:48.872
People do that?
They burn letters?

31:48.874 --> 31:51.008
I've only seen that
in old movies.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.076
Those movies weren't old
to gloria.

31:57.382 --> 32:00.717
This room is filled
with degas, monet,

32:00.719 --> 32:02.085

by an unknown argentinean.

32:11.296 --> 32:13.297

32:13.299 --> 32:15.399
Damn it!
This isn't a complete set.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.401
There's only 23
champagne glasses.

32:17.403 --> 32:18.635
We're missing one.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.570
The list was checked
only a week ago.

32:20.572 --> 32:22.706
Look.
"complete set."

Never drink
and you never lose your head.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.051
Were they stored here?
Yeah.

You know your glassware.

32:46.765 --> 32:49.099
She never drank,
yet there's one glass missing.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.801
Marta's story
doesn't make sense.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.070
Okay, ray.
I'll check the dinner plates.

32:53.072 --> 32:55.072
Dinner.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.107

this is annoying,

your phone?

32:59.611 --> 33:01.345
Marta, I don't care
where you're from,

33:01.347 --> 33:03.347
What kind of troubles you had
back in the home country.

Yeah, traditional.

Don't call me again,

33:29.974 --> 33:32.676
It didn't happen here.
She was given the drug later.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.311
What about
the liver sample?

33:34.313 --> 33:36.146
Duck confit's
incredibly salty.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.547
The sodium in her system

33:37.549 --> 33:39.649
Would have accelerated
the drug's effect.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.719
The time of poisoning was wrong
by 30 minutes, maybe an hour.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.654
So, she was killed
before the gala.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.655
Let's check the car.

I want you both out.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.500

33:56.502 --> 33:58.568
Why do you not want us
to find your mother's killer?

33:58.570 --> 34:00.737
You have marta.

Who was in this limo

Conrad, sofia, marta --

34:59.530 --> 35:02.799
Jo, you don't
have to call anyone.

35:02.801 --> 35:04.301
I know who did it.

35:08.139 --> 35:09.739
Lieutenant reece,

35:09.741 --> 35:12.709
I want an explanation
for this.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.711
That's why we're here.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.079
Who killed my mother?

35:16.081 --> 35:17.447
Henry: Gloria did.

35:19.817 --> 35:20.984
It was suicide?

35:20.986 --> 35:22.152
My autopsy revealed

35:22.154 --> 35:23.920
A woman
with months to live.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.590
Gloria knew this,
so she planned her own death,

35:26.592 --> 35:28.158
Down to the last detail --

35:28.160 --> 35:30.760
When she would take the drug
that would kill her,

35:30.762 --> 35:33.096
How much time
she would have after that.

35:33.098 --> 35:35.132
She chose
the night of the gala

35:35.134 --> 35:38.168
Because it was a celebration
of her favorite place

35:38.170 --> 35:40.003
And her one chance
to tell everyone

35:40.005 --> 35:41.771
Exactly what she thought
of them.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.607
The party
was her suicide note.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.942
She left the gala
knowing she only had

35:45.944 --> 35:47.577
A few moments to live.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.813
But she was held up
by lance.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.315
The drug was acting
too fast now.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.218
When she came to the stairs,
she fell.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.488
And here was my mistake.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.290
I couldn't imagine her

36:00.292 --> 36:02.292
Dragging herself
across the floor,

36:02.294 --> 36:04.961
30 meters,
in pain few could imagine.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.297
I thought only fear
could drive someone to do that.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.633
Henry, you're lecturing.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.468
Why did she do it?

36:11.470 --> 36:12.669
Because there was
another reason.

36:14.138 --> 36:16.339
There was a letter
in gloria's fireplace,

36:16.341 --> 36:18.141
Burned the night she died.

36:18.143 --> 36:19.509

36:35.159 --> 36:36.826
In the 1950s,

36:36.828 --> 36:39.296
Fernando costa was
a young painter on the rise --

36:39.298 --> 36:41.498
Promising, but hardly worthy
of this museum.

36:41.500 --> 36:44.501

could make this happen.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.536

He told me
how he'd found out

37:11.697 --> 37:15.765
And threatened to ruin
this young painter.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.201
And mother relented
and stayed.

37:18.203 --> 37:21.371
Father took pride
in having won her back.

37:21.373 --> 37:25.041
He said it was just a dalliance
that she'd forgotten.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.043
But he was wrong.

37:27.045 --> 37:30.480
She never forgave him.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.585
And I never forgave her.

37:43.060 --> 37:44.628
She donated
millions of dollars

To secretly keep
this painting

37:46.198 --> 37:47.731
On display...

41:01.059 --> 41:03.726
Someday I'll be gone
and you'll still be here.

41:05.429 --> 41:08.598
Abigail...

41:08.600 --> 41:10.667
This may be rash...

41:15.105 --> 41:17.774
I don't know
what the future holds.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.309
But as long
as I'm alive...

41:19.311 --> 41:21.277
¶ I give myself
in sweet surrender ¶

41:21.279 --> 41:22.745
...I will always love you.

41:24.081 --> 41:25.682
Forever.

41:25.684 --> 41:28.284
Will you marry me?

41:28.286 --> 41:33.523
¶ my one and only

41:33.525 --> 41:40.230
¶ love
