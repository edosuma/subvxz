11:07.867 --> 11:09.500
WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.467
ALL RIGHT.
SHAWN, I'M SORRY.

11:11.467 --> 11:14.834
NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.
NOT THIS TIME.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.400
I WANT TO HEAR
THAT YOU WERE WRONG,

11:17.400 --> 11:20.567
THAT I ASKED YOU TO BACK OFF,
AND YOU WOULDN'T TAKE "NO"
FOR AN ANSWER,

11:20.567 --> 11:23.934
THAT YOU TOTALLY
DISREGARDED MY FEELINGS.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.400
YOU WENT WAY TOO FAR
THIS TIME, CORY.

11:26.400 --> 11:29.100
ALL RIGHT, I DID THAT.
OK, BUT--

11:29.100 --> 11:31.867
OH, THERE BETTER NOT
BE A "BUT."

11:31.867 --> 11:33.767
I DID THIS
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

11:36.100 --> 11:38.767
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT MY POETRY
IS ABOUT, DO YOU?

11:38.767 --> 11:41.300
THAT POEM THAT FEENY
READ IN CLASS--

11:41.300 --> 11:45.600
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT?

11:45.600 --> 11:47.000
NOTHIN'.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.000
CORY...

11:50.000 --> 11:52.200
I CAN'T SAY
CERTAIN THINGS,

11:52.200 --> 11:54.800
SO I WRITE THEM DOWN.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.133
THAT'S HOW
I GET THEM OUT.

11:56.133 --> 11:59.667
NOW, I DO THAT FOR ME,
NOT FOR ANYONE ELSE.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.767
I HEARD THE POEM, SHAWN.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.567
YOU HEARD IT, BUT YOU
DIDN'T LISTEN TO IT.

12:03.567 --> 12:05.400
THAT POEM
YOU JUST READ--

12:05.400 --> 12:08.200
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHO THAT WAS ABOUT?

12:08.200 --> 12:10.100
ME.

12:11.133 --> 12:12.400
IT'S ABOUT ANGELA.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.934
I WROTE THAT FOR HER.

12:15.934 --> 12:17.767
WELL...

12:28.567 --> 12:31.367
ANGELA, WAIT.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.600
THANK YOU.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.834
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.734
WELL, THAT'S A FIRST.

12:50.734 --> 12:53.300
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
I READ SHAWN'S POEM.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.400
AND...
NO.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.500
I'M NOT SORRY I READ
SHAWN'S POEM.

12:56.500 --> 13:01.300
DON'T YOU SEE THAT HE
WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU
HOW HE FEELS?

13:01.300 --> 13:03.133
THEN HE SHOULD TELL ME.

13:03.133 --> 13:06.500
ANGELA, HE--HE'S
WRITING POEMS FOR YOU.

13:06.500 --> 13:10.200
I MEAN,
HE OBVIOUSLY IS STILL
IN LOVE WITH YOU,

13:10.200 --> 13:12.400
AND I KNOW YOU STILL
LOVE HIM.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.700
REMEMBER? YOU TOLD ME.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.000
WE WERE IN THE BATHROOM,
AND YOU WERE IN A TOWEL--

13:16.000 --> 13:19.033
I REMEMBER.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.500
MAYBE I DO STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR SHAWN, OK?

13:20.500 --> 13:25.100
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.400
I'M FINALLY OK.
I'VE STARTED TO MOVE ON.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.500
HUH.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.900
THEN WHAT WAS
THE SLAP ABOUT?

13:33.900 --> 13:38.667
HOW CAN HE STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME AND NOT
WANT TO BE WITH ME?

13:39.867 --> 13:41.600
I DON'T KNOW.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.467
YOU KNOW,
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

13:43.467 --> 13:46.200
HE'S THE ONE THAT WANTED
TO MEET NEW PEOPLE.

13:46.200 --> 13:51.700
IF HE CAN'T TELL ME
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT ME,
THEN--THEN WHAT ARE WE?

13:51.700 --> 13:57.500
WELL, IT'S NOT MY NATURE
TO INTERFERE...

14:00.066 --> 14:01.700
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.133
MAYBE...HIS POETRY
IS--IS...

14:04.133 --> 14:08.800
THE ONLY TRUE WAY
THAT HE CAN TELL YOU
HOW HE FEELS.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.600
YOU KNOW? SO...

14:10.600 --> 14:12.900
MEET HIM HALFWAY.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.600
TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.

14:25.734 --> 14:27.367
SHAWN...
ANGELA...

14:28.400 --> 14:29.767
GO AHEAD.

14:29.767 --> 14:30.867
YOU SURE?

14:30.867 --> 14:33.767
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HIT ME AGAIN,
ARE YOU?

14:33.767 --> 14:35.767
I'M SORRY I DID THAT.

14:35.767 --> 14:38.367
NO, IT'S COOL.
I PROBABLY DESERVED IT.

14:38.367 --> 14:40.467
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

14:42.734 --> 14:47.900
LOOK, I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THESE WORDS IN MY HEAD
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

14:47.900 --> 14:50.467
'CAUSE I WANT TO SAY
THIS RIGHT.

14:50.467 --> 14:54.834
OH, JUST...
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.734
WE USED TO TALK.

14:57.734 --> 15:00.066
I MEAN, REALLY TALK.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.200
I MISS THAT.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.367
I MISS IT, TOO.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.400
THINGS JUST GOT WEIRD.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.000
I MEAN, I GOT WEIRD.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.800
BUT I DON'T WANT US
TO EVER STOP TALKING.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.700
I COULDN'T STAND THAT.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.700
OH, NEITHER COULD I.

15:14.700 --> 15:17.133
AND WHEN I HEARD
THAT POEM--

15:17.133 --> 15:20.300
YEAH, THE POEM. THAT'S
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

15:20.300 --> 15:23.767
I WROTE THAT...
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:26.600 --> 15:27.600
YOU DID?

15:27.600 --> 15:30.600
YEAH, LIKE WAY BEFORE
WE BROKE UP.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.233
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FEEL WEIRD,

15:33.233 --> 15:36.400
AND, YOU KNOW...
EVERYTHING'S OK.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.300
OHH. WELL, GREAT.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.400
BECAUSE, UM, IT WOULD'VE
REALLY BEEN AWKWARD

15:42.400 --> 15:44.767
KNOWING THAT YOU STILL
HAD FEELINGS FOR ME,

15:44.767 --> 15:48.100
YOU KNOW, WHEN--WHEN
I'VE CLEARLY MOVED ON.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.934
RIGHT.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.900
SO I--I GUESS
WE'VE BOTH MOVED ON.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.867
YEAH.

15:57.934 --> 16:00.934
WE CAN JUST...
GO FORWARD AS FRIENDS.

16:00.934 --> 16:03.467
GOOD FRIENDS.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.834
HEY, ARE WE EVER GONNA
SEE YOU TWO APART?

16:11.834 --> 16:14.500
NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.033
HEY, EVERYBODY!

16:17.033 --> 16:19.200
WHEN'S THE NEXT TEST, HUH?
HEY, WHO CARES?

16:19.200 --> 16:23.500
LISTEN, MAN, I THOUGHT
I'D BE THE LAST PERSON
TO SAY THIS,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.834
BUT, UH, HEY, THANKS
FOR LETTING US ALL KNOW

16:25.834 --> 16:27.100
WE JUST HAD
TO MELLOW OUT.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.100
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S
THE SUCCESS RATE

16:29.100 --> 16:30.100
OF THIS SYSTEM
OF YOURS?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.100
SYSTEM?
WHAT SYSTEM?

16:31.100 --> 16:34.567
THE ERIC MATTHEWS
FOOLPROOF STUDY SYSTEM.

16:34.567 --> 16:36.867
OHH, DUDE!
TOTALLY MADE THAT UP.

16:36.867 --> 16:37.867
YOU TOTALLY DID
WHAT?

16:37.867 --> 16:39.567
OH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
STOP GRUMBLING.

16:39.567 --> 16:42.367
NOW, I KNOW YOU GUYS
ARE ALL INTERESTED TO SEE
IF THIS IS GONNA WORK,

16:42.367 --> 16:43.567
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SO AM I.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.867
SO ARE YOU?! YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:45.867 --> 16:49.100
[EVERYONE TALKING AT ONCE]

16:50.200 --> 16:51.767
OK, WHAT HAS HE
DONE NOW?

16:51.767 --> 16:56.300
HE TALKED US INTO THIS
IDIOTIC STUDY SYSTEM OF HIS.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.400
OH, INTERESTING.
HMM.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.100
LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN,

17:00.100 --> 17:02.100
YOUR GRADES.

17:03.300 --> 17:04.700
YES!
YES!

17:04.700 --> 17:06.567
I CAN'T SEE!

17:07.600 --> 17:09.967
AUDREY,
YOU GOT AN "A"!
SO DID I!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.500
ERIC! ERIC! ERIC!

17:13.500 --> 17:15.100
ERIC! ERIC!

17:15.100 --> 17:17.467
FEENY! FEENY!

17:18.500 --> 17:19.867
HANG WITH ME, HMM?

17:19.867 --> 17:22.000
WELL, I DID NOTHING WRONG.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.867
IS IT A CRIME TO TAKE OFF
YOUR LEFT SHOE AND TAKE
YOUR FRIEND TO THE CINEMA?

17:25.867 --> 17:28.500
TAKE OFF YOUR LEFT SHOE?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.400
OH, NOT NOW, FEENY,
COME ON.

17:30.400 --> 17:33.834
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WAS
SO UPTIGHT ABOUT THE FINALS,

17:33.834 --> 17:35.967
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
TRIED TO RELAX THEM A BIT.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.200
OH, I SEE.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.934
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'M IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR INSIGHT.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.400
A RECENT UNIVERSITY
STUDY SHOWED

17:42.400 --> 17:45.934
THAT NONSTOP FOCUSING
ON ONE'S STUDIES

17:45.934 --> 17:47.500
HINDERED PERFORMANCE.

17:47.500 --> 17:53.300
SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA
TO PUT DOWN THE BOOKS
AND CLEAR ONE'S MIND.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.300
YEAH.

17:54.300 --> 17:57.300
AFTER ONE HAS
STUDIED THOROUGHLY

17:57.300 --> 18:00.200
AND ABSORBED
THE MATERIAL.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.900
YEAH.

18:01.900 --> 18:04.233
YOU FORGOT THAT PART,
DIDN'T YOU?

18:04.233 --> 18:05.734
YEAH. YEAH.

18:05.734 --> 18:08.800
I DIDN'T DO SO GOOD,
DID I?

18:08.800 --> 18:11.033
YEAH.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.400
DOH!

18:17.400 --> 18:18.834
I TOLD YOU.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.567
HEY.

18:24.567 --> 18:25.867
THEY'RE NOT HERE YET.

18:25.867 --> 18:27.767
YOU'RE KIDDING?
WE'RE GONNA MISS
THE MOVIE.

18:27.767 --> 18:28.834
I KNOW.

18:28.834 --> 18:31.967
SO, UH, IS EVERYTHING OK
WITH YOU AND ANGELA?

18:31.967 --> 18:34.133
YEAH, WE--WE
TALKED IT OUT.

18:34.133 --> 18:37.967
I TOLD HER THAT I WROTE
THE POEM BEFORE WE BROKE UP,

18:37.967 --> 18:40.200
AND EVERYTHING'S OK.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.200
GOOD.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.100
HEY, WAIT.

18:43.100 --> 18:45.567
SHAWN, IS THAT
THE BOOK YOU WROTE
THE POEM IN?

18:45.567 --> 18:46.567
MM-HMM.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.367
ISN'T THAT THE BOOK
THAT I GAVE YOU

18:48.367 --> 18:49.367
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY?

18:49.367 --> 18:50.834
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

18:50.834 --> 18:53.767
WELL, MY POINT IS YOU
AND ANGELA BROKE UP
BEFORE YOUR BIRTHDAY.

18:53.767 --> 18:57.033
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
WRITTEN THAT POEM
2 MONTHS AGO.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.767
SHAWN.

19:01.033 --> 19:03.500
OK. OK. YOU GOT ME.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.300
I WROTE IT AFTER WE BROKE UP.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.800
HOW LONG AFTER?
NOT LONG AFTER.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.800
HOW LONG AFTER?
I WROTE IT
2 WEEKS AGO.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.033
OH, SHAWN, YOU STILL
DO LOVE ANGELA!

19:11.033 --> 19:13.934
LET'S KEEP IT DOWN,
LET'S KEEP IT DOWN.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.867
I CAN'T GET HER OUT
OF MY MIND, YOU KNOW?

19:17.867 --> 19:19.133
I MISS HER.

19:19.133 --> 19:21.233
I MISS HOW SHE MADE
ME FEEL.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.033
I MISS THE FACT THAT
I COULD TELL HER THINGS

19:23.033 --> 19:25.400
THAT NO ONE ELSE UNDERSTANDS,
NOT EVEN CORY.

19:25.400 --> 19:26.500
THEN TELL HER THAT.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.767
I--I CAN'T
TELL HER THAT.
WHY NOT?

19:27.767 --> 19:29.734
BECAUSE I TOLD HER
THAT I NEEDED MY SPACE.

19:29.734 --> 19:31.934
I TOLD HER THAT I WANTED
TO MEET NEW PEOPLE.

19:31.934 --> 19:32.900
I DID THIS.

19:32.900 --> 19:34.133
WELL, IF YOU TWO
LOVE EACH OTHER,

19:34.133 --> 19:35.133
YOU SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

19:35.133 --> 19:36.767
MAYBE IF ANGELA
KNEW HOW YOU FELT--

19:36.767 --> 19:37.800
NO, IT'S TOO LATE.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.300
ANGELA'S NOT IN LOVE
WITH ME ANYMORE.

19:39.300 --> 19:43.734
SHE TOLD ME SHE'S OVER ME
AND SHE JUST WANTS TO BE
FRIENDS.

19:43.734 --> 19:45.300
Cory: HEY!

19:45.300 --> 19:47.367
LISTEN, ARE YOU OK
WITH US ALL GOING OUT?

19:47.367 --> 19:51.000
I MEAN, I HOPE I DIDN'T
MESS EVERYTHING UP FOR YOU.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.600
I'M OK.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.400
YOU MEAN WELL.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.700
YOU ALWAYS MEAN WELL.

19:57.700 --> 20:01.567
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T TELL SHAWN
ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL, RIGHT?

20:01.567 --> 20:03.367
I KNOW.

20:03.367 --> 20:04.667
I WANT YOU TO PROMISE ME,

20:04.667 --> 20:07.800
PROMISE ME YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL ANYONE, EVEN CORY.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.233
OK.
I MEAN THAT.

20:10.233 --> 20:11.734
PINKY SWEAR.

20:12.800 --> 20:13.800
I SWEAR.

20:13.800 --> 20:15.867
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SWEAR?

20:15.867 --> 20:19.467
I SWEAR THAT I'M GOING
TO KILL YOU IF WE
MISS THIS MOVIE.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.600
WHAT TOOK YOU GUYS
SO LONG?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.100
WE WERE JUST TYING UP
SOME LOOSE ENDS.
RIGHT, COR?

20:24.100 --> 20:29.600
YEAH. HEY, WE--WE BETTER
GET GOING IF WE DON'T
WANNA MISS THIS MOVIE.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.500
ARE WE OK?

20:34.500 --> 20:38.100
YOU'RE MY DATE,
AREN'T YOU?

20:47.367 --> 20:51.000
MY NEXT POEM IS CALLED
<i>FRUSTRATION.</i>

20:51.000 --> 20:53.033
[BONGOS PLAY]

20:58.367 --> 21:01.033
COME ON, TOPANGA!

21:09.500 --> 21:13.834
I CALL THIS NEXT POEM
<i>FEENY.</i>

21:16.867 --> 21:20.233
MR. FEENY IS VERY SMART

21:20.233 --> 21:24.000
ON MANY SUBJECTS,
INCLUDING ART.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.900
AND YET HE CAN'T HELP ME
WITH MY FRUSTRATION.

21:26.900 --> 21:30.767
COME ON, TOPANGA!
