just for today,

05:06.806 --> 05:08.266
{\an3}just while we're here,
you can pretend

05:08.349 --> 05:11.060
{\an3}we're in, like,
Hawaii or something.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.521
I don't think so.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.732

Hi.

05:19.527 --> 05:21.404
Hi.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.949
I'm all right, I guess.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.077
Listen, I was wondering--
I don't know what you guys

05:28.161 --> 05:29.245
are doing tonight,
but I though that

05:29.328 --> 05:30.538
maybe you'd like to come over
to my house for dinner.

05:30.621 --> 05:33.833
My mom's kind of worried
about you.

05:34.667 --> 05:35.585
Unless, of course,
you're busy.

05:35.668 --> 05:39.255
No, we're not busy.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.257
Great, then I'll see you
tonight.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.425
Okay.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.178
Tell your mom thSure.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.224
You don't mind, do you?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.101
No, of course not.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.566
{\an3}How 'bout this issue--
October 17.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.985
{\an3}We had the Bonnie
Bernstein piece

06:01.069 --> 06:02.028
{\an3}on foreign
exchange students,

06:02.111 --> 06:05.239
{\an3}and your article on
high school contributions

06:05.323 --> 06:06.282
{\an3}to the Somalian relief
fund was excellent.

06:06.365 --> 06:08.534
{\an1}Two stories you can be sure
every other high school

06:08.618 --> 06:10.745
{\an1}in the country
has done... twice.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.914
Then I think we should go
with our first instincts

06:12.997 --> 06:15.249
{\an3}and focus on the issue
with Brandon's editorial

06:15.333 --> 06:16.292
{\an3}on the cancelled
football game.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.294
Oh, but the rest
of that issue stinks.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.504
Come on, Andrea,
it doesn't stink.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.756
Gil, let's face it.

06:21.839 --> 06:22.715
Almost everything
we've done this year stinks.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.301
You nailed it the day
you walked in here.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.261
<i>The Blaze</i> is okay,
it's passable.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.097
{\an1}But we have not
published one issue

06:29.180 --> 06:30.973
{\an1}distinctive enough
to win us any awards.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.185
That may be so, but you're being
much too hypercritical.

06:34.268 --> 06:34.685
Isn't she?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.979
Isn't she always?

06:37.063 --> 06:38.648
{\an1}You guys,
I have reason to be.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.608
{\an1}Look at this, we received
another entry form

06:40.691 --> 06:41.984
for a high school
journalism award.

06:42.068 --> 06:45.196
This one sends the winning
editors on a trip to D.C.

06:45.279 --> 06:46.531
{\an3}Really?

06:46.614 --> 06:47.657
Well, don't pack your bags,
Brandon.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.660
It's not like we're going to win
any awards this year.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.203
You know, that's one thing

06:52.286 --> 06:53.955
{\an3}I really like
about you, Andrea.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.540
{\an3}It's your
positive attitude.

06:55.623 --> 06:58.668
Look, I'm just
being realistic, okay?

06:58.751 --> 07:00.878
I mean, Gil and I have spent
the last hour

07:00.962 --> 07:02.296
going over back issues.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.923
There is nothing here.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.717
{\an3}Andrea, the year's
not over yet.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.136
Well, we better hurry up.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.221
We publish three more issues
before the contest deadline,

07:10.304 --> 07:11.556
and I want the Class of '93
to be remembered.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.518
I want to be remembered.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.020
Don't worry, Andrea.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.981
We'll remember you.

07:21.607 --> 07:24.527
(lush pop intro playing)

07:24.610 --> 07:26.320
I did a little noodling
over the weekend

07:26.404 --> 07:27.989
and I think I have it here.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.907
This is the feel
we need on this song.

07:29.991 --> 07:32.034
Now, I know it's
not what you're used to.

07:32.118 --> 07:32.702
I just want you to listen to it,

07:32.785 --> 07:35.163
just groove on it.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.165
You feel it?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.209
You feel it?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.919
Uh, it's... it's different.

07:42.003 --> 07:44.046
{\an1}Of course it's different.
It has to be different.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.048
{\an1}Who wants more of the same?
Now here, listen to this.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.258
Hey, listen.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.218
(lush, synthesized orchestra

07:49.302 --> 07:50.428

07:50.511 --> 07:52.054
(music clicks off)hat?

07:52.138 --> 07:55.141
Yeah, I-I guess it is.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.936
What do you think?

07:59.020 --> 08:01.230
Uh, well, don't ask me.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.190
{\an1}I don't really know
that much about music.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.234
Well, you know what
you like, don't you?

08:05.318 --> 08:05.735
Come on, tell him.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.070
It's fabulous.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.908
David, it's fabulous.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.075
You see?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.535
She knows.

08:14.619 --> 08:15.786
I know, Davey...

08:15.870 --> 08:17.914
It's perfect.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.463
{\an1}David, why are you
recording this song?

08:25.546 --> 08:28.090
{\an3}You heard what Serge
said, he likes it.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.092
{\an1}Yeah, but I thought you
were going to go with hip-hop.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.093
Rap, you know, the hot stuff.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.261
Which is exactly what
I tried telling him,

08:33.346 --> 08:34.764
{\an3}but he said that this
song is commercial.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.142
{\an1}Well, I guess he
knows what's best.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.980

ballad playing)

08:43.063 --> 08:45.107

08:48.736 --> 08:50.571
{\an1}Hi, Duke.
How are you doing?

08:50.655 --> 08:51.447
You remember me?

08:51.530 --> 08:52.823
We met last year
at the racetrack.

08:52.907 --> 08:53.950
Oh, yeah, sure.

08:54.033 --> 08:54.951
{\an3}How you doing,
sweetheart?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.953
Good.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.121
Hey, big Hey.

08:59.205 --> 08:59.997

09:00.081 --> 09:03.125
{\an3}Nah, just here
on a little busineAh.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.049
Hey, busy, kid?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.300
Yeah, sort of.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.677
{\an1}Me, too. That's why this'll
only take a minute.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.013
Can we step outside?

09:16.097 --> 09:19.058
{\an3}Sure. Just let me tell
Nat I'm gonna be a minute.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.604
Sure thing, kid.

09:28.818 --> 09:32.238
We had a conversation
a couple of weeks ago.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.198
{\an3}In case you've
forgotten,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.659
{\an3}maybe I should
refresh your memory.

09:36.742 --> 09:37.994
No, I remember
what you said.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.078
Then where's my money?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.872
{\an3}I said I'd let you slide one
time and one time only.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.000
And I paid you every cent.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.126
That was the last time.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.211
{\an3}Where's the money
you owe me now?

09:49.714 --> 09:50.298
I'll, I'll get it.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.841
I just need a few days, Duke.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.010
I like you.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.679
I do.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.973
But this guy in my car--

09:59.056 --> 10:00.182
that's Tony--

10:00.266 --> 10:03.185
{\an3}and Tony, he doesn't
like anybody.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.855
{\an3}So, you know how much
you owe us, right?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.898
Yeah.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.026
It's a lot of money, kid.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.527
You got till Friday.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.241
(car door opens, engine starts)

10:19.910 --> 10:22.913
Well, who wants some seconds?

10:22.997 --> 10:24.081
Without Jim and Brandon here,

10:24.165 --> 10:25.791
{\an3}there's practically
a whole pie left.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.376

I'm stuffed.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.878
Dylan?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.379
Yeah, thanks.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.007
You know, it seems like

10:33.090 --> 10:33.883
{\an1}the first meal
I've had in a few days.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.010
{\an1}It's certainly the first
one I've tasted.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.928
Well, you come here as much
as you want, Dylan.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.347
BRENDA:
Yeah, no matter what.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.556
Remember, this is home.

10:40.639 --> 10:40.848
Thanks, Bren.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.562
Why am I doing this?

10:46.645 --> 10:47.938
{\an3}I'm supposed to
be on a diet.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.065
Would somebody
please stop me?

10:49.148 --> 10:50.358
Save me from myself.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.568
Now, what do you need
to diet for, Kelly?

10:52.651 --> 10:55.363
{\an1}That's what I keep
asking her.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.781
{\an3}Well, we've been eating
so much junk food

10:56.864 --> 10:59.784
{\an3}the past few weeks, I
must've gained five pounds.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.619
So, do like I do:

11:01.702 --> 11:03.913
{\an3}Eat today,
diet tomorrow.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.915
{\an3}Someday, Dylan, that's
going to catch up with you.

11:05.998 --> 11:06.749
{\an1}Yeah, but till then,
pass the pie.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.918
{\an1}BRENDA:
Brandon, better get in here

11:09.001 --> 11:10.252
quick, the pie
is going fast.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.213
{\an3}I didn't think you'd be home
for dinner tonight, honey.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.006
{\an3}I thought you and Dad
were both working late.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.133
Nah, things were kind of slow
and Nat said

11:16.217 --> 11:16.926
he'd close up by himself.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.219
{\an3}Oh, well, I'll
set you a place.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.595
{\an1}No, Mom,
that's all right.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.930
I'm not really hungry
and I've got a lot

11:21.013 --> 11:23.307
Brandon, just sit down
and eat something.

11:23.391 --> 11:23.766
{\an1}Mom, listen to what
I'm saying here.

11:23.849 --> 11:27.103
I'Brandon...!y.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.816
Sorry, I've just
got a lot on my mind.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.859
Apparently.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.404
Brandon, have you
met these people?

11:36.487 --> 11:37.947
Yeah. Hi, guys.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.907
Tough day at the office?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.617
Something like that.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.953
{\an3}Mrs. Walsh, I hate
to eat and run,

11:44.036 --> 11:45.955
but I told my Mom I'd
be home early tonight.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.581
{\an3}DYLAN:
Thanks, it was great.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.792
I'm glad to see you relaxing
a little bit, Dylan.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.292
I'll get coats.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.254
See ya. later, man.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.436
Dylan, don't take me home yet.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.146
Let's go to your house.

12:10.229 --> 12:12.148
I thought you said you
had to be home early.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.608
That's what I told the Walshes.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.492
Not tonight, Kel.

12:26.704 --> 12:29.665
You know, you haven't wanted
to be alone with me in days.

12:29.748 --> 12:30.958
What's the matter with you?

12:31.041 --> 12:32.126
How can you ask me that?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.002
You know what's the matter.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.546
Then let me help you.

12:35.629 --> 12:37.798
Don't keep pushing me away.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.678
{\an3}I haven't been sleeping,
I'm tired...

12:45.931 --> 12:48.559
{\an1}All right.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.561
{\an3}I'm sorry.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.854
That's all right.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.981
Just take me home.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.070
(door opens)

13:00.154 --> 13:01.489
Hi, honey.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.740
{\an1}Hi, baby.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.575
How'dOh...er go?

13:04.658 --> 13:07.203
{\an3}well, Brenda and Kelly
and Dylan were fine.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.078
{\an3}It's Brandon I'm
worried about.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.164
What's the matter?

13:10.247 --> 13:12.917
{\an3}I don't know,
he just seems...

13:13.000 --> 13:15.377
{\an3}distracted.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.505
I'll talk to him.

13:23.969 --> 13:24.929
(knocking)

13:27.473 --> 13:28.849
Can I come in?

13:28.933 --> 13:29.934
Sure.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.067
Ooh, what's this?

13:38.150 --> 13:41.362
Jose Canseco rookie card.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.781
{\an1}Oh! Must be worth
six or seven bucks.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.616
Twenty, if it's mint.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.408
Whew!

13:48.661 --> 13:50.579
{\an1}You've got some
great cards here.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.789
Yeah, they're okay.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.582
Nothing outstanding.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.209
{\an3}I'm actually thinking about
getting them appraised.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.294
Maybe selling them.

13:58.170 --> 14:00.256
What's going on, Brandon?

14:00.339 --> 14:03.217
{\an1}One week you're
buying skis and stereos.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.802
{\an1}The next week,
you're talking about

14:04.885 --> 14:06.011
{\an1}selling off
your baseball cards.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.221
{\an1}What's wrong
with this picture?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.098
There's nothing
going on, Dad.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.559
{\an3}I told you, I'm not
necessarily selling them.

14:11.642 --> 14:12.893
I'm just looking into it.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.647
{\an1}Brandon, I know
you've been gambling.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.314
Dad...

14:17.398 --> 14:19.066
{\an1}You know,
I was never a guy

14:19.149 --> 14:20.609
{\an1}who believed in
get-rich-quick schemes.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.945
{\an1}Probably why
I never got rich.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.072
{\an1}But gambling--
it's just not worth it.

14:25.155 --> 14:26.782
The house always wins.

14:26.865 --> 14:27.950
I know that.

14:28.033 --> 14:28.826
Then why do you do it?

14:28.909 --> 14:30.828
Dad, I just bet on
a couple of games.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.162
It's no big deal.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.124
You're not in any trouble?

14:35.207 --> 14:36.584
Of course not.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.130
Look son, if you
have a problem...

14:41.213 --> 14:44.133
Dad, I don't have
a problem, okay?

14:44.216 --> 14:47.761
{\an3}God, how many times do I
have to repeat myself?

14:47.845 --> 14:48.846
Okay... okay, okay.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.504
Steve, wait!

15:22.588 --> 15:24.173
{\an1}Donna.

15:24.256 --> 15:24.840
What are you doing here
soI, uh,?

15:24.923 --> 15:25.424
I wanted to
talk to you.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.551
{\an3}Listen, I need
a favor.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.011
Anything for you.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.846
{\an3}Actually, it's
for David.

15:30.929 --> 15:31.347
Then forget it.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.015
No, Steve, listen.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.850
{\an3}I was in the studio
with David last night

15:34.933 --> 15:36.644
and something is
definitely wrong.

15:36.727 --> 15:38.312
Look, I don't want
to hear it, okay?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.938
In case you've forgotten,
I'm no longer his manager.

15:40.022 --> 15:40.689
I'm not interested

15:40.773 --> 15:42.316
{\an1}in being his armchair
quarterback,

15:42.399 --> 15:43.901
{\an1}and I certainly don't want
to be his shrink, okay?

15:43.984 --> 15:44.526
It's his gig.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.194
{\an1}And I'm late
for detention.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.237
Steve, wait.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.865
{\an3}This producer Menkon is
ruining everything.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.367
{\an3}He's not picking David's
best material

15:51.450 --> 15:53.160
{\an3}and then he's making
it even worse.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.370
Please.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.205
I know how angry you are.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.831
{\an3}But you're the only one
that can help him.

15:57.915 --> 15:58.999
{\an1}Well, he should have
thought of that

15:59.083 --> 15:59.333
before he blew me off.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.710
{\an3}I know.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.878
{\an3}And David feels
terrible.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.046
He didn't want
to cut you out.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.881
What, they held a gun
Tto his head?.

16:05.964 --> 16:06.590
{\an1}I don't think so,
Donna.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.342
{\an1}People do what they want
to do.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.052
Steve, you're his friend.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.720
Besides, at this point,

16:11.804 --> 16:12.554
he hasn't cut you out
of anything.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.556
Ten percent of nothing
is nothing.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.933
You're there. You have a mouth.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.059
{\an1}Yeah...

16:17.142 --> 16:18.894
and the only reason David
allowed me to come

16:18.977 --> 16:20.604
is because I promised not
to say anything.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.023
Steve, please,

16:23.107 --> 16:24.525
will you just come and see
what's going on?

16:28.987 --> 16:31.407
{\an3}Put, uh, $15 on UCLA
for me, will ya?

16:31.490 --> 16:32.241
Oh, big spender, Miller.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.410
{\an3}Come on, you're
on a roll.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.619
{\an3}Might as well make
some dough.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.829
I'm in for $30.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.080
You got it, Stuart.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.082
Any other takers?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.250
{\an1}Morning,
gentlemen.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.793
Hiya, Walsh.

16:42.876 --> 16:43.877
Would you do me a favor?

16:43.961 --> 16:45.879
Tell Miller that he's betting
like an old lady?

16:45.963 --> 16:46.839
Hey,

16:46.922 --> 16:48.966
{\an1}just make sure you pay up
when I win, will ya?

16:50.968 --> 16:53.095
(laughing)

16:53.178 --> 16:55.973
{\an1}So, how do you keep track
of your bets, Jeff--

16:56.056 --> 16:57.933
{\an1}flash paper
in your locker?

16:58.016 --> 16:59.101
Yeah, right.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.270
{\an3}You been watching too
many old movies, Walsh.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.272
This is the age
of electronics.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.273
{\an3}Everybody's got
a code name.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.276
{\an3}I use the Vegas
point spread.

17:07.358 --> 17:08.819
Very professional.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.820
{\an3}Full-service
operation, Walsh.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.698
{\an3}You bet with me,
I pay on time

17:12.781 --> 17:13.949
{\an3}and I even save
you the cost

17:14.031 --> 17:15.951
of a phone call
to your bookie.

17:16.034 --> 17:18.619
{\an1}Well, I might just have
some action for you.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.496
{\an1}If you think
you can cover it.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.165
Course I can.
I can handle anything.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.208
Who do you like?

17:23.291 --> 17:25.127
The CeltOoh.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.670
A traditionalist.

17:26.753 --> 17:27.838
Mm-hmm.

17:27.921 --> 17:30.048
No points with that.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.258
Even-steven.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.344
{\an3}How much?

17:36.263 --> 17:39.183
Either you are very confident,

17:39.266 --> 17:41.351
very rich or very stupid.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.479
{\an1}We'll find out soon
enough, won't we?

17:49.735 --> 17:52.654
{\an3}Hi, Kelly.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.741
{\an3}Sorry you had to leave
so early last night.

17:57.576 --> 18:00.496
I told you my mom
expected me home.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.623
Sorry I mentioned it.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.833
{\an6}Brenda, why don't you
just ask Dylan to
move in with you?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.335
{\an1}What is that supposed
to mean?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.669
It means you like
him coming around

18:07.753 --> 18:08.962
to cry on your shoulder.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.173
{\an1}Look, Kelly,
what is wrong with you?

18:11.256 --> 18:13.467
{\an1}Dylan and I have gone
through a lot together,

18:13.550 --> 18:14.885
{\an1}and I think,
at a time like this,

18:14.968 --> 18:16.845
{\an1}he needs as many friends
as he can get.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.180
I'm sorry.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.934
{\an3}I'm just going through
a lot right now.

18:22.017 --> 18:23.185
We all are.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.480
I know, I'm sorry.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.190
Yeah.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.858
See ya.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.904
(toilet flushing)

18:37.449 --> 18:39.159
{\an3}You heard that,
didn't you?

18:39.243 --> 18:42.579
This isn't a competition,
you know.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.874
This is Dylan's feelings
you're talking about.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.961
I know.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.799
Ever since the funeral, it's
like I can't even talk to him.

18:53.882 --> 18:55.759
Nothing I say cheers him up.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.761
Why don't you both back off
a little?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.847
You're right.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.392
Thanks.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.489
{\an3}Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.033
I can't do it, man.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.035
{\an1}I mean, I just,
I can't be here, I...

19:22.119 --> 19:22.744
I wake up in the morning

19:22.828 --> 19:24.413
{\an1}and for the first
few seconds,

19:24.496 --> 19:25.622
before I open my eyes,

19:25.706 --> 19:27.082
{\an1}I think everything's
gonna be the same.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.584
And then it hits me.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.877
That he's gone

19:29.960 --> 19:31.086
{\an1}and it's never gonna
be the same and...

19:31.169 --> 19:33.088
{\an1}and coming to school
just seems stupid.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.089
Let's cut out of here.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.090
Go shoot some pool, huh?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.258
Nah.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.759
Glad to know your heart's
in the right place, man,

19:37.843 --> 19:39.887
I think I should hang out
by myself for awhile.

19:39.970 --> 19:40.804
See ya.

19:40.888 --> 19:43.182
ANDREA:
<i>I've been wracking my brains</i>

19:43.265 --> 19:43.724
{\an1}trying to come up
with leads,

19:43.807 --> 19:45.601
and then it hit me...

19:45.684 --> 19:46.977
there's a great story,

19:47.060 --> 19:47.436
{\an1}right there in front
of my nose.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.354
There often is.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.898
You just gotta
sniff it out.

19:50.981 --> 19:51.940
So what do you got?

19:52.024 --> 19:52.900
Well, we haven't done

19:52.983 --> 19:55.110
this month's senior
profile yet, right?

19:55.193 --> 19:56.778
{\an3}Right.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.781
I want to interview
Dylan McKay.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.617
Interesting.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.619
{\an1}I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.621
What do you mean
it's not a good idea?

20:05.704 --> 20:07.122
{\an3}I mean, it's definitely
newsworthy

20:07.205 --> 20:08.624
and it could
help Dylan.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.833
How?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.752
Because talking helps,
that's how.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.921
Well, you may want to believe
that, Andrea.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.422
I mean, you might even really
believe that, but we all know

20:15.505 --> 20:17.466
what's going on here.

20:17.549 --> 20:18.800
You want a good news story,

20:18.884 --> 20:19.927
{\an1}and you're willing
to use one

20:20.010 --> 20:21.136
{\an1}of your friends
to get it.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.471
Excuse me, Brandon,

20:22.554 --> 20:23.305
it's not like I'm sneaking
around publishing

20:23.388 --> 20:25.766
{\an3}the unauthorized
biography

20:25.849 --> 20:26.683
of Dylan McKay.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.143
Look, I'm just going to ask him.

20:28.226 --> 20:29.937
If he doesn't want to do it,
he can say no.

20:30.020 --> 20:30.979
{\an3}She's right,
Brandon.

20:31.063 --> 20:31.980
She's doing her job.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
And in this case,
it means asking the source.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.108
Well, I guess that means

20:35.192 --> 20:36.777
you're a better journalist
than I am, Andrea,

20:36.860 --> 20:38.987
'cause there's no way in a
million years I'd ever do it.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.324
I'm going to go look for Dylan
before third period, okay?

20:42.407 --> 20:44.993
Don't botherWhy? went home.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.954
Because he can't deal
with any of this, Andrea.

20:47.037 --> 20:47.496
And the last thing he's gonna
want to deal with

20:47.579 --> 20:49.706
is a nosy reporter.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.504
(phone ringing)

20:55.587 --> 20:56.672
(on answering machine):
It's Dylan.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.090
You kno(beep) to do.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.050
Hi, Dylan, it's Andrea.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.302
Are you there?

21:05.806 --> 21:08.517
Well, I just wondered
if you felt up to some company.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.810
But I, I guess you're not there.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.144
So I'll just call you later...

21:11.228 --> 21:13.063
Andrea, wait, uh, I'm here.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.065
Hi, Dylan.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.818
Uh, Brandon told me
that you, uh, went home.

21:17.901 --> 21:21.321
Yeah, I... just had a little
trouble putting one foot

21:21.405 --> 21:21.738
in front of the other today.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.865
Well, I, um...

21:23.949 --> 21:25.117
Look, I just wanted to say

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
if there's anything I can do
for you...

21:27.160 --> 21:28.453
You know, like,

21:28.537 --> 21:30.539
like if you want to talk
or something,

21:30.622 --> 21:31.707
I'm, I'm a great listener.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.667
Thanks. I, uh...

21:33.750 --> 21:34.876
appreciate that.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.754
Uh, maybe I could come over
or something.

21:38.797 --> 21:42.718
Yeah, uh... if you want to.

21:42.801 --> 21:43.719
Great.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.720
I'll, uh,

21:44.803 --> 21:45.721
I'll come over after school.

21:45.804 --> 21:46.763
Okay.

21:46.847 --> 21:47.556

David, you're hitting
the consonants too hard.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.533
{\an1}You've got
to soften them up.

22:06.616 --> 22:07.743
{\an3}(sighing):
All right.

22:07.826 --> 22:08.744
Let's do it again.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.745
From the top.

Steve...

22:19.671 --> 22:21.757
How's it going?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.425
Well, David's been working
on this vocal

22:23.508 --> 22:25.427
for the past couple
of days.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.137
Cut.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.139
{\an1}(over speaker):
Cut.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.391
{\an1}David, let's take it again
from the top, okay?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.435
Okay.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.562
(intro begins again)

22:35.645 --> 22:39.357
{\an1}This isn't exactly
dance music.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.319
{\an1}What happened
to hip-hop?

22:42.402 --> 22:43.945
What is this, a party

22:44.029 --> 22:44.738
{\an3}or a recording
session?

22:44.821 --> 22:45.947
{\an1}We're guests
of the artist.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.752
Cut, cut.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.170
The levels are wrong.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.839
{\an1}Hold on, we'll go again
from the top.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.966
{\an1}Maybe we should try
a different mike.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.719
So...

23:07.803 --> 23:09.679
Davey has a lot of friends, huh?

23:09.763 --> 23:12.182
{\an1}Excuse me,
I was just wondering

23:12.265 --> 23:12.641
{\an1}why you picked
this song.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.684
I mean, it's good,

23:14.768 --> 23:16.436
{\an1}but it's certainly
not one of his best.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.979
Really?
And what makes you the expert?

23:18.063 --> 23:19.648
I'm Steven Sanders.

23:19.731 --> 23:20.899
I used to be

23:20.982 --> 23:22.150
David's manager.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.152
{\an3}"Used to be" is the
key phrase there.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.821
I'm his producer.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.489
{\an3}And I think I've been
around this block

23:27.572 --> 23:28.657
{\an3}a few more times
than you have.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.617
Yeah, maybe.

23:30.700 --> 23:31.618
But what was your last hit?
"Disco Duck"?

23:31.701 --> 23:32.577
Steve...

23:32.661 --> 23:34.496
Look...

23:34.579 --> 23:36.498
{\an3}I don't know who the hell
you think you are,

23:36.581 --> 23:40.836
{\an3}but the last thing I need
in here is negativity.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.504
{\an3}So, why don't you take your
attitude out of here

23:42.587 --> 23:44.506
{\an3}before you get the
talent nervous.

23:44.589 --> 23:48.343
Fine.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.686
Uh, where's Steve going?

23:57.769 --> 23:59.688
He had to leave.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.943
Said to tell you he loved it.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.905
{\an3}Remember... no
negativity.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.825
Or you're out
the door, too.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.243
{\an3}So Davey,

24:13.326 --> 24:14.494
{\an1}everything
sounds great.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.537
Let's take it again
from the top, okay?

24:15.620 --> 24:19.249
(intro begins again)

24:22.794 --> 24:23.670
SPORTSCASTER:
The Celtics down by 18.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.881
Parrish has fouled out
of the game

24:25.964 --> 24:27.048
at the end of the third quarter.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.759
Oh, that's it,
the fix is in.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.845
How much you got
Enough.line, pal?

24:31.928 --> 24:34.055
This is why I didn't want
to give you Duke's number

24:34.139 --> 24:34.598
in the first place.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.808
You're out of control.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.768
I know Nat, I know.

24:38.852 --> 24:39.769
But this is it--
I win this bet,

24:39.853 --> 24:41.021
I'm through; no more.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.814
{\an1}And what if you don't
win this bet?

24:42.898 --> 24:44.774
Don't even think about it.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.318
You should.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.239
DYLAN:
<i>Hey, would you like some tea?</i>

24:51.323 --> 24:51.990
ANDREA:
<i>Sure.</i>

24:52.073 --> 24:53.742
{\an1}Well, they say
it calms the nerves.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.119
{\an3}Oh, is that
what they say?

24:56.203 --> 24:58.121
Mm-hmm.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.414
{\an3}Well...

24:59.497 --> 25:00.332
(clears throat)

25:00.415 --> 25:01.791
...they say the same
thing about Scotch,

25:01.875 --> 25:04.628
{\an3}but with tea,
there's no hangover.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.254
(classical music playing)

25:06.338 --> 25:08.423
Could not...

25:08.506 --> 25:09.966
be in school today.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.593
{\an1}Well, if anybody deserves
to feel like that, it's you.

25:11.676 --> 25:13.595
{\an3}Hmm.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.263
But, you know,
this is nice.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.265
{\an3}I mean, being
here with a girl

25:17.349 --> 25:17.766
{\an3}who's not really
my girlfriend.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.935
{\an1}(laughs)

25:20.018 --> 25:22.604
That's because you don't have
to worry about impressing me.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.774
{\an3}Yeah, or hurting
your feelings or...

25:25.857 --> 25:27.776
{\an3}Well, I can
just be myself,

25:27.859 --> 25:28.610
{\an3}and there's no
strings attached.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.820
{\an3}You don't want
anything from me.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.115
{\an3}Everybody
else does.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.952
Brenda, Kel,

25:37.035 --> 25:38.995
especially my dad.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.623
Why? What did he want?

25:41.706 --> 25:45.001
{\an3}He wanted me to be
the man he never was.

25:45.085 --> 25:45.835
What's wrong with that?

25:45.919 --> 25:48.797
{\an3}It just seems a
little hypocritical.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.632
I hate a hypocrite.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.842
{\an1}Do you think your dad
was a hypocrite?

25:52.926 --> 25:55.804
I used to; I did.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.722
{\an3}I mean, but then
there toward the end,

25:57.806 --> 25:59.808
{\an3}I realized that that's
just the only way

25:59.891 --> 26:02.477
{\an3}he knew how
to live life.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.812
{\an3}So I accepted it
on his terms.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.814
Then he died.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.816
{\an1}Then why don't you continue
to accept him?

26:07.899 --> 26:10.110
{\an1}I mean, why go change
the terms now?

26:11.903 --> 26:14.322
You're pretty smart.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.657
(laughs):
Oh.

26:15.740 --> 26:16.908
{\an1}Yeah, that's what
I've been told.

26:16.992 --> 26:21.454
No, I mean, you're
smart about people.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.623
Like I said,

26:23.707 --> 26:24.708
I'm a good listener.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.296
Dylan, um, I was thinking
on my way here--

26:29.379 --> 26:31.506
and I don't want you
to take this

26:31.589 --> 26:32.799
{\an1}the wrong way--
but, uh,

26:32.882 --> 26:35.844
I was wondering

26:35.927 --> 26:38.888
if you'd be interested
in being the subject of, um,

26:38.972 --> 26:39.848
{\an1}this month's
senior profile.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.142
Ah, strings.

26:42.225 --> 26:43.977
I should have known better.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.854
No strings.
I mean, you can say no.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.648
I said no...

26:48.732 --> 26:50.775
to the <i> Times, Daily News,</i>
<i>People</i> magazine.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.694
Why should I talk to you?

26:52.777 --> 26:55.363
Because I'm your friend.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.700
Why don't we keep it that way?

27:00.285 --> 27:01.911
SPORTSCASTER:
Where else but the Garden

27:01.995 --> 27:03.872
could the Celtics make
a comeback like this?

27:03.955 --> 27:05.165
It's one of those games

27:05.248 --> 27:07.042
where it doesn't matter
who wins or loses.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.710
Oh, yes, it does, buddy.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.253
McHale has the ball
at the foul line.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.504
He's already missed
the first of two.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.049
But the Celts only need one
to take the game here tonight.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.342
McHale sets, and it's good!

27:15.425 --> 27:16.718
Yes, yes!

27:16.801 --> 27:17.385
And so,
the Celtics have done it.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.429
They've bCha-ching!Lakers...

27:19.512 --> 27:19.929
Nat, Nat, did you
hear that?

27:20.013 --> 27:22.307
What? it! I did it!

27:22.390 --> 27:22.891
Oh, that's
great.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.851
Steve, Steve, sit down.

27:24.934 --> 27:25.769
{\an1}Anything you want,
it's on me.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.562
{\an3}Wait a second.
What's going on here?

27:27.645 --> 27:29.397
The Celts won, and I'm back
in the land of living, my man.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.565
{\an3}Oh, yeah?

27:30.648 --> 27:32.901
Nat, if I ever want
to make another bet,

27:32.984 --> 27:34.402
slap me upside the head,
would you?

27:34.486 --> 27:35.236
Okay, I will.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.863
I cannot wait
to see Jeff Stellar.

27:36.946 --> 27:39.532
How much did you bet?

27:39.616 --> 27:40.575
Fifteen.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.619
You're jumping up
and down over $15?

27:42.702 --> 27:44.037
Hundred, Steve.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.663
$1,500.

27:45.997 --> 27:48.541
(laughing):
Yeah. You're kidding.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.542
No.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.419
You got to be out of your mind.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.754
Not anymore.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.756
Brandon, I hate
to burst your bubble,

27:54.839 --> 27:55.965
but what makes you think

27:56.049 --> 27:58.593
Stellar can come up
with that kind of dough?

27:58.676 --> 27:59.677
Come on, Steve.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.430
No bookie would ever take a bet
he couldn't cover.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.890
Guys get seriously ill
from doing stuff like that.

28:03.973 --> 28:07.060
Brandon, he takes penny ante
bets from school boys.

28:07.143 --> 28:08.853
$10, $20, maybe $30.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.940
You're talking about
some real money here.

28:12.023 --> 28:12.941
{\an3}Stellar hasn't
got it.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.402
Well, he better have it.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.861
Yeah, well, he might not.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.331
Well, there he is.

28:28.415 --> 28:30.792
{\an1}Yeah, at least
he showed up at school.

28:30.875 --> 28:31.167
{\an3}That's a good
sign, isn't it?

28:31.251 --> 28:32.794
{\an3}Good luck.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.629
Morning, Jeff.

28:34.712 --> 28:37.424
{\an1}Looks like I wasn't
overconfident at all,

28:37.507 --> 28:38.466
{\an1}was I?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.176
{\an3}Nope. You weren't
too stupid, either.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.178
{\an1}I'll find that out
when you pay me.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.472
{\an3}Don't worry, Brandon.
I got you covered.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.642
{\an1}Good. I didn't want to have
to break your kneecaps.

28:47.725 --> 28:48.435
(laughs)

28:48.518 --> 28:49.978
So, you working
this afternoon?

28:50.061 --> 28:52.147
{\an3}Good.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.648
{\an3}I don't like to carry
cash around school,

28:53.731 --> 28:54.858
so, I'll see you
at the Pit later.

28:54.941 --> 28:57.152
Yeah, make it
before 6:00.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.486
No problem.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.991
So?

29:03.074 --> 29:03.950
{\an3}So it looks
like he's got it,

29:04.033 --> 29:05.869
{\an3}or he's going to
have it by tonight.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.371
{\an1}You lead a charmed
life, Brandon.

29:08.455 --> 29:10.373
Yeah.

29:18.173 --> 29:19.841
Andrea.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.384
(clears throat)

29:21.468 --> 29:22.802
Hi.

29:22.886 --> 29:24.888
Uh, Dylan, look,

29:24.971 --> 29:27.056
I'm... I'm sorry
about yesterday.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.309
No. That's, uh...
that's why I'm here, actually.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.895
I thought about what you said,
and, um,

29:31.978 --> 29:33.855
I don't know,
maybe you're right.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.484
Maybe... Maybe telling my story
will help somehow.

29:37.567 --> 29:37.984
You mean that?

29:38.067 --> 29:40.028
Yeah.

29:40.111 --> 29:42.030
I just... I don't want you
to write it.

29:42.113 --> 29:45.200
Oh, uh, what,

29:45.283 --> 29:48.203
{\an3}you want Brandon
to write it?

29:48.286 --> 29:49.037
No. I, uh...

29:49.120 --> 29:51.831
I want to write it.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.459
You do?

29:54.542 --> 29:55.835
Yeah.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.212
I can put two sentences
together, you know.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.755
I know.

29:58.838 --> 30:00.673
I... I didn't mean it like that.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.091
The thing is, I...
I don't know...

30:02.175 --> 30:04.052
I don't know
if I want it published.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.554
You know, I just want
to write it first, and...

30:06.638 --> 30:08.848
I'd like you
to help me.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.558
Sure.

30:10.642 --> 30:11.893
I'd love to.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.686
Thanks.

30:16.814 --> 30:18.066
{\an6}KELLY:
Are you ready
for this?

30:18.149 --> 30:21.778
{\an1}I gained two pounds yesterday,
and I didn't eat anything.

30:21.861 --> 30:22.904
{\an1}Something is definitely
wrong with me.

30:22.987 --> 30:25.198
{\an3}Nothing is wrong
with you.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.407
{\an3}It's probably
just water.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.201
{\an3}What time of
the month is it?

30:28.284 --> 30:29.410
No, it's not that.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.955
{\an1}I'm just on my way
to being a bona fide porker.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.206
(laughing):
What? I'm serious.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.792
{\an1}When I was little,
I was a major butterball,

30:35.875 --> 30:38.962
and no matter what anybody said,
it was definitely not cute.

30:39.045 --> 30:42.382
I'm never going to let myself
get that way again.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.592
{\an3}I'm prepared
this time.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.052
What is that?

30:46.135 --> 30:47.095
Don't worry, I bought
'em at the drugstore.

30:47.178 --> 30:49.097
They're harmless.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.181
{\an3}It's just one of those
over-the-counter diet pills.

30:50.265 --> 30:50.974
Do they work?

30:51.057 --> 30:53.476
I don't know,

30:53.560 --> 30:55.144
but if it does what the ad
says, it'll cut my appetite

30:55.228 --> 30:57.939
{\an3}and help me to lose those
stubborn five pounds.

30:58.022 --> 30:58.982
Well, I don't see five pounds.
I think you look great.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.359
That's camouflage.

31:01.442 --> 31:03.903
I'm just glad it's
not bikini season.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.619
{\an5}ANDREA:
<i>The best advice</i>
<i>anybody ever gave me</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:14.789
{\an1}about writing was: "Don't
talk about it, do it."

31:14.872 --> 31:15.915
{\an3}Ah, yes, the
Nike approach.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.919
{\an1}All I can say is, if I had
a house like this to myself,

31:20.003 --> 31:20.962
{\an1}I could write
and write and write.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.590
You sound like
Virginia Woolf.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.341
{\an1}You read
<i>A Room of One's Own?</i>

31:25.425 --> 31:26.801
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

31:26.884 --> 31:28.803
{\an1}We just read that
in AP English class.

31:28.886 --> 31:30.179
{\an3}Oh, you guys read some
great stuff in that class.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.640
Brandon showed me
your reading list.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.309
{\an1}Well, you should have
taken that class.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.603
I mean, you... you've
done most of the work.

31:36.686 --> 31:38.980
Eh, like I should have done a
lot of things, but I didn't.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.524
And why didn't you?

31:41.608 --> 31:43.151
I mean, I spent my whole life
fighting my father,

31:43.234 --> 31:47.113
and now that he's not here
to fight anymore, I kind of...

31:47.196 --> 31:48.031
I realize
he was right all along.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.325
I was just too stubborn

31:50.408 --> 31:51.826
to admit it.

31:51.909 --> 31:53.703
{\an1}It's not too late
(laughs)e.

31:53.786 --> 31:54.954
That's what he said.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.122
Well, then do it.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.000
{\an1}I mean, it's three months
until graduation.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.169
Yeah, but will three months
of hard work make up

32:01.252 --> 32:03.963
for three years of goofing off?

32:04.047 --> 32:05.632
{\an1}Well, I know, uh,
one class you can start with.

32:05.715 --> 32:07.008
AP English?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.177
{\an1}Look, you've done most
of the work.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.220
You think Meyers
He might.for it?

32:11.304 --> 32:13.556
If we talk to him.

32:17.935 --> 32:20.104
Hey, someone's
looking for you.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.273
{\an1}Oh, great.
Uh, listen, do me a favor.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.859
{\an1}Give me a minute,
would you?

32:24.942 --> 32:26.527
{\an3}Yeah, I know, but
make it fast.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.529
It's starting
Yeah, yeah, okay.

32:28.613 --> 32:30.531
You want to step
into my office?

32:30.615 --> 32:31.282
Lead the way.

32:34.077 --> 32:36.037
Brandon, uh...

32:36.120 --> 32:39.040
{\an1}I don't know how to tell you
this exactly, but, um,

32:39.123 --> 32:42.001
{\an1}I mean, it's unusual
for me, but...

32:42.085 --> 32:43.211
{\an1}I'm going to need
a little more time.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.253
What?!

32:44.337 --> 32:46.756
I'm good for it,
really I am.

32:46.839 --> 32:47.757
{\an1}It's just, this weekend
kind of stacked up...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.384
What was all that crap
you told me at school?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.677
I can cover your action,
Brandon, no problem.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.553
I thought I could,
but it's either you,

32:52.637 --> 32:54.222
or the whole football team,
and you are a lot smaller.

32:54.305 --> 32:56.224
(laughs)

32:56.307 --> 32:57.183
{\an1}This isn't
Brandon,man.

32:57.266 --> 32:59.060
it's no big deal really.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.395
I'll pay off.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.062
{\an1}I've been in business
a long time.

33:01.145 --> 33:03.564
I don't welch.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.025
How could you take a bet
you couldn't cover, huh?

33:06.109 --> 33:07.360
You know what I
could do to you?

33:07.443 --> 33:09.404
Do you? Do you?!

33:09.487 --> 33:11.197
Brandon, calm down.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.573
Don't tell me
to calm down.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.783
{\an3}Don't you say
anything to me.

33:13.866 --> 33:15.576
{\an3}You just listen to me
for a minute, all right?

33:15.660 --> 33:16.786
(tires screeching)

33:16.869 --> 33:18.037
{\an3}You're going to
get me that money,

33:18.121 --> 33:19.580
and you're going
to get it for me

33:19.664 --> 33:20.915
{\an3}in 24 hours, you
understand me?

33:20.998 --> 33:21.582
Brandon,
what the hell are you doing?

33:21.666 --> 33:22.333
{\an3}I don't care
how you get it.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.251
I don't care who
you have to beg.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.293
{\an3}I don't care if you
have to steal it.

33:24.377 --> 33:26.421
{\an3}I want the money,
you understand?

33:26.504 --> 33:27.422
{\an3}You give me the money,
or I'm gonna break

33:27.505 --> 33:28.589
every bone in your body.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.299
{\an1}Steve, man, get this guy
off me! He's crazy!

33:30.383 --> 33:32.510
Brandon, go inside.
You better watch it.

33:32.593 --> 33:35.054
(thudding, debris clattering)

33:35.138 --> 33:36.347
(panting)

33:36.431 --> 33:39.016

Well, that's the final mix.

34:07.044 --> 34:09.005
Huh, what do you think?

34:09.088 --> 34:09.589
Is this terrific or what?!

34:09.672 --> 34:11.299
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.801
You guess so?

34:13.885 --> 34:16.219
This has platinum
written all over it.

34:16.304 --> 34:19.974
I guess it's just, uh,
still kind of hard

34:20.056 --> 34:22.018
hearing my own stuff,
that's all.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.812
Artists--
you're all so insecure.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.438
{\an1}Believe me,
this stuff is great.

34:26.522 --> 34:28.815
Yeah, we've got a meeting
with Curtis Bray tomorrow.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.193
{\an5}(laughing):
When he hears this,
he's going to flip out.

34:30.275 --> 34:32.195
Well, what if he doesn't?

34:32.277 --> 34:34.447
David...

34:34.530 --> 34:35.864
(exhales loudly)

34:35.947 --> 34:37.992
Mellow. Hmm? Hmm?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.619
He's going to love it.

34:42.789 --> 34:46.167
Brandon, why didn't you tell me
a little bit about this sooner?

34:46.250 --> 34:47.168
Maybe I could have helped.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.337
I didn't want anyone to know.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.880
{\an3}You could always go
to your dad.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.174
No, no, I can't
tell my dad.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.342
I've been lying to him
for too long,

34:54.425 --> 34:56.761
telling him I'm just
betting chump change.

34:56.844 --> 34:57.929
It's not his problem. I can't
drag him into it.

34:58.012 --> 35:00.640
{\an3}Yeah, well, which is worse,
telling your dad or Duke?

35:00.723 --> 35:02.350
I don't know.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.227
I'm out of control, man--
I don't know what

35:04.310 --> 35:06.395
I would have done to that kid
if you wouldn't have shown up.

35:06.479 --> 35:10.191
{\an6}How could you even expect
Jeff to come up with that
kind of money?

35:10.274 --> 35:12.902
I don't know.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.153
Maybe you could go to your mom.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.321
Tell her some kind of sob story.

35:15.404 --> 35:17.198
No, I don't think so.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.200
She put the brakes on that kind
of thing a long time ago.

35:19.283 --> 35:20.535
{\an3}She gives me a check at the
beginning of the month

35:20.618 --> 35:21.994
and I've got to make it last.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.704
{\an3}And it's all gone right
now, except $300.

35:23.788 --> 35:24.747
I'll take it.

35:24.831 --> 35:25.748
Yeah, but then what?

35:25.832 --> 35:27.166
Then I'll pray.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.710
What do you think
they're gonna do to me,

35:29.794 --> 35:31.212
break my nose,
maybe break my thumbs?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.714
No. Not for $1,500.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.217
Steve, he's got this big goon
that drives him around.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.011
They're just trying
to scare you; you'll see.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.096
I don't think so.

35:58.823 --> 35:59.574
Hey, BrandHi.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.743
I got soHow much?for you.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.036
200 bucks, that's it?

36:04.120 --> 36:05.163
Don't sweat it, Brandon.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.581
{\an1}There'll be more
in a couple of days.

36:06.664 --> 36:07.915
{\an1}But you better keep
your hands off me

36:07.999 --> 36:08.749
{\an1}or you can forget
about seeing a penny.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.043
{\an3}Look, Jeff, don't
worry about it.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.336
{\an6}You're not the one
who's gonna take the
heat around here, I am.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.548
{\an1}I know it's almost
the end of the year,

36:15.631 --> 36:16.757
{\an1}but he's read most
of the books.

36:16.841 --> 36:17.675
{\an1}He's smarter than
half the class.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.886
{\an3}Why this sudden
interest in literature?

36:19.969 --> 36:21.596
{\an1}'Cause he wants
to turn his life around.

36:21.679 --> 36:23.764
This is the first step.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.391
Where is he?

36:25.474 --> 36:28.269
Outside.

36:33.399 --> 36:36.777
{\an1}I hear you want
to be in my class.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.738
If you'll have me.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.489
{\an1}I'll talk to Mrs. Teasley
about it.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.491
{\an1}But first, there are
a few conditions.

36:42.575 --> 36:43.576
{\an3}Like...?

36:43.659 --> 36:45.578
You can't cut.

36:45.661 --> 36:46.954
Okay.

36:47.038 --> 36:47.413
And you'll do the work.

36:47.496 --> 36:49.290
I can do that.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.666
And you'll think.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.668
That might be a tough one.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.504
Somehow I doubt that.

36:56.589 --> 36:59.383
(phone ringing)

37:01.385 --> 37:03.179
{\an3}Brandon...

37:03.262 --> 37:05.139
Nat's on the phone for you.

37:05.222 --> 37:06.515
Did you tell him I was here?

37:06.599 --> 37:08.643
Well, of course I did.

37:10.728 --> 37:12.813
Thanks.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.275
Hey, Nat.

37:16.359 --> 37:18.611
Brando, you better
get in here.

37:18.694 --> 37:19.320
Duke's waiting for you.

37:19.403 --> 37:22.114
And he's not happy.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.867
God, Nat, do me a favor.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.494
Don't tell him where
I live, okay?

37:26.577 --> 37:28.996
Believe me, pal,
he already knows.

37:31.707 --> 37:32.583
Thanks.

37:37.630 --> 37:41.425
(pop music playing)

37:45.554 --> 37:47.431
(music ends)

37:51.268 --> 37:54.689
So David, what
do you think, hmm?

37:54.772 --> 37:57.316
I have to say, it's the best
work I've ever done.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.526
Really?

37:58.609 --> 37:59.485
Oh, absolutely.

37:59.568 --> 38:00.653
I love the way
the song turned out.

38:00.736 --> 38:04.532
You know, in my career,

38:04.615 --> 38:07.702
I've always prided myself on
being able to spot talent.

38:07.785 --> 38:08.369
It's a gift I have.

38:08.452 --> 38:11.205
Absolutely. A gift.

38:11.288 --> 38:15.543
{\an3}But every now and then,
my vision clouds.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.712
Who knows why?

38:17.795 --> 38:20.548
{\an1}I mean, you can't
explain these things.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.885
{\an1}The sound isn't what
I was hoping for.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.470
{\an3}Yeah, I think I know
what you mean.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.432
In fact, I didn't want
to bring this up,

38:29.515 --> 38:31.392
but when you asked me
to produce this album,

38:31.475 --> 38:35.229
this wasn't at all
what I thought

38:35.312 --> 38:36.355
I'd have to work with.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.566
Wait a second,
I don't understand.

38:38.649 --> 38:39.734
You said that

38:39.817 --> 38:44.363
that was my best material.
The most commercial song I had.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.198
I keep trying to tell the kid

38:46.282 --> 38:47.241
it all comes down
to the material.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.535
If it isn't there, no matter
how much production

38:49.618 --> 38:52.288
{\an3}you throw at it,
it won't work.

38:52.371 --> 38:55.541
So true, Serge, so true.

38:55.624 --> 38:58.878
The producer serves
the material,

38:58.961 --> 38:59.754
the artist guides the product.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.965
That's what I was
trying to explain.

39:03.049 --> 39:03.924
But you chose the song.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.384
I didn't even want to use it.

39:05.468 --> 39:05.926
I wanted to go with
the hip-hop stuff.

39:06.010 --> 39:07.762
You didn't say anything.

39:07.845 --> 39:08.888
Serge is a producer,

39:08.971 --> 39:10.931
not a mind reader, David.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.559
Well, I can do other material.

39:13.642 --> 39:15.603
Sorry, kid, it's just not
going to work out.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.480
So that's it?

39:17.563 --> 39:18.939
I don't even get another chance?

39:19.023 --> 39:20.566
You're young, kid.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.610
{\an1}There'll be plenty
more chances for you.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.404
But it wasn't my fault.

39:25.488 --> 39:25.946
You heard my songs.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.948
David, I heard a demo.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.617
{\an1}A teenager fooling around
in his garage.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.661
Do you know how many more
teenagers there are out there?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.580
{\an1}Hmm?

39:34.663 --> 39:36.040
Good luck.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.462
David.

39:41.545 --> 39:45.299
{\an1}Well, kid, we tried.
It's showbiz.

39:45.382 --> 39:46.092
{\an3}No it isn't. This has nothing
to do with show business.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.135
{\an3}You're just an
over-the-hill hack

39:48.219 --> 39:50.930
{\an6}with no taste trying to
hold on to a lousy job,
and you know what?

39:51.013 --> 39:53.974
I don't need you
or Icon Records.

39:55.601 --> 39:59.688
{\an1}Dylan, how long are you
going to do be doing that?

39:59.772 --> 40:01.649
{\an3}Kel, I told you-- I'm writing,
and it's not something

40:01.732 --> 40:04.276
{\an3}I know when
I'm going to finish.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.820
{\an3}Can't you do homework
or something?

40:05.903 --> 40:07.947
I guess.

40:11.742 --> 40:15.788
{\an1}But I can think of something
I'd rather be doing.

40:15.871 --> 40:18.290
Can you?

40:18.374 --> 40:21.794
Not now Kel, come on.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.671
{\an3}Well, at least I can read
what you've written.

40:23.754 --> 40:27.716
No, not until it's finished.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.718
Great.

40:29.802 --> 40:32.847
{\an3}Hey, it's not
personal, okay?

40:32.930 --> 40:35.516
{\an3}It's just, I'm writing
about my dad

40:35.599 --> 40:36.517
{\an3}and feelings and
stuff and...

40:36.600 --> 40:40.354
{\an3}I just don't want to
share it until it's done.

40:40.437 --> 40:40.729
I understand.

40:40.813 --> 40:41.689
You sure?

40:41.772 --> 40:44.567
Yeah.

40:44.650 --> 40:45.568
I told Donna and David
that I'd meet them

40:45.651 --> 40:46.569
at the Peach Pit anyway.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.363
All right.
I'll call you later.

40:49.446 --> 40:50.990
You don't have to.

40:51.073 --> 40:52.199
I want to.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.410
Don't be mad.

40:54.493 --> 40:56.912
I'll be fine.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.706
{\an1}Just go on back
to your writing, okay?

41:07.631 --> 41:08.966
(sighs)

41:24.481 --> 41:25.441
{\an3}Hi, Duke.

41:25.524 --> 41:26.483
{\an1}Brandon.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.319
And how are you today?

41:30.070 --> 41:32.406
Ah, okay... one,

41:32.489 --> 41:33.407
two,

41:33.490 --> 41:35.409
three, four,

41:35.492 --> 41:37.244
five...

41:37.328 --> 41:38.621
Five.

41:38.704 --> 41:40.623
{\an1}What, are you
kidding me or what?

41:40.706 --> 41:43.083
Huh? You owe me three times
this much.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.585
I know.

41:44.668 --> 41:45.252
The rest is coming.

41:45.336 --> 41:46.879
I just need a little more time.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.380
{\an1}You never learn,
do you kid?

41:48.464 --> 41:49.798
It's a good thing you got
such good friends.

41:54.803 --> 41:57.598
{\an1}And you owe your
good friend Nathaniel here

41:57.681 --> 42:00.976
a thousand bucks, huh?

42:01.060 --> 42:02.728
Nice to see you, Nat.

42:02.811 --> 42:06.357
Lay low for awhile, kid.

42:14.573 --> 42:16.242
You paid off Duke for me?

42:16.325 --> 42:17.660
Yeah.

42:17.743 --> 42:18.786
{\an3}And you're gonna work
off every cent.

42:18.869 --> 42:20.829
I will, Nat, I promise,
Every last cent.

42:20.913 --> 42:25.084
How many times did I ask you:
Is everything all right?

42:25.167 --> 42:26.252
Could you handle this?

42:26.335 --> 42:26.877
You were right.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.837
(sighs)

42:28.921 --> 42:30.673
I got out of control.

42:33.175 --> 42:35.261
Nah, it's more than that.

42:35.344 --> 42:36.637
{\an3}You know how many
gamblers think

42:36.720 --> 42:37.805
{\an3}they can get out
of the hole

42:37.888 --> 42:39.640
by betting again and again
and again?

42:39.723 --> 42:41.684
I know.

42:41.767 --> 42:42.768
Do you?

42:46.105 --> 42:49.149
I ever catch you
gambling again,

42:49.233 --> 42:51.652
the first call I make
is to your father.

42:51.735 --> 42:54.655
Thanks, Nat.

42:54.738 --> 42:58.659
I won't forget this.

42:58.742 --> 43:00.619
Neither will I.

43:07.126 --> 43:07.668
So, how'd it go?

43:07.751 --> 43:10.671
Down the tubes.

43:10.754 --> 43:11.505
What?

43:11.588 --> 43:13.465
They dumped me.

43:13.549 --> 43:15.009
Why?

43:15.092 --> 43:16.593
'Cause Bray hated the song.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.180
We all hated the song.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.098
At least he showed
he had taste.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.891
{\an3}So that's it, the
whole thing's over?

43:22.975 --> 43:27.521
{\an6}Well, it's better to be
dumped than have your name
on something that you hate.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.063
Yeah, I guess so.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.857
(hip-hop music playing)

43:29.940 --> 43:34.528
Hmm, now that's a song.

43:34.611 --> 43:37.448
Maybe next time,
you'll listen to me.

43:37.531 --> 43:41.201
Does that mean there
might be a next time?

43:41.285 --> 43:44.663
{\an3}There might be.
If you listen to me.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.665
So, who wants what?

43:46.749 --> 43:47.833
{\an3}I think we'll all
have hamburgers

43:47.916 --> 43:49.668
{\an1}and French fries,
on me.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.712
Ah! What's the occasion?

43:51.795 --> 43:54.131
Silver and I are
back in business.

43:56.759 --> 43:58.177
{\an1}You know, I'm not very hungry.
I'll just have coffee.

43:58.260 --> 43:59.636
Okay, doll.

44:01.555 --> 44:03.724
Look, don't you think

44:03.807 --> 44:05.059
you're overdoing this diet
thing a little bit?

44:05.142 --> 44:07.853
Donna, I've already lost
a pound and a half.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.605
Only have a few more to go.

44:09.688 --> 44:10.439
Stop worrying about me.

44:10.522 --> 44:11.940
I'll be right back, okay?

44:15.694 --> 44:16.737
So, what do you think?

44:16.820 --> 44:17.738
This is a good song.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.116
(sighs)
