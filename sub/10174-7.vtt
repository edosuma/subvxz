No, I'm gonna sublet
my apartment on BnBNYC,

00:14.669 --> 00:17.671

I don't have a jerb right now.

18:09.400 --> 18:10.863
All right, thanks, Trey.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.055
No problem.

18:28.348 --> 18:30.852
(sighs heavily)

18:47.634 --> 18:48.967
Hey.

18:55.308 --> 18:56.608
(whispering) Bazinga.

18:57.235 --> 18:59.826
I am so sorry that my phone
was on "do not disturb."

18:59.882 --> 19:01.416
I love that function.

19:01.517 --> 19:04.086
You must have been so
scared here, all alone

19:04.187 --> 19:06.019
and that had just happened.

19:06.289 --> 19:07.323
Um...

19:07.424 --> 19:08.385
Actually...

19:10.427 --> 19:11.560
I was.

19:11.661 --> 19:13.629
I felt really brave, though.

19:13.730 --> 19:16.298
My mom always said that
French people hate Jews.

19:16.399 --> 19:18.267
I'm pretty sure it's
unrelated, though, right?

19:18.368 --> 19:20.569
Right, he probably didn't
know that you were...

19:21.362 --> 19:22.862
Perfect nose.

19:22.897 --> 19:24.573
Uh... I'm...

19:24.674 --> 19:26.475
Dude, ew!

19:26.576 --> 19:28.677
Ohhhh! Ew!

19:28.778 --> 19:30.679
- What the (bleep)?
- What the (bleep)?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.058
- A (bleep) condom!
- Ab, this is it!

19:33.093 --> 19:35.005
This could be the key
to the whole crime!

19:35.040 --> 19:37.554
This could unlock the whole
thing, it's only six to...

19:37.654 --> 19:39.221
- Six-and-a-half
hours old. - What?

19:39.322 --> 19:40.489
Fresh on his tail.

19:40.590 --> 19:43.589
We could find out exactly who
this guy is through his DNA!

19:43.624 --> 19:46.128
Trail him down, nail him down! Fist!

19:46.229 --> 19:48.035
Okay, I don't think
that's a good idea, dude.

19:48.070 --> 19:49.006
You didn't see him.

19:49.041 --> 19:51.133
- He was dangerous.
- Really?

19:51.234 --> 19:53.035
Yeah, we gotta just, like,
throw that condom away

19:53.136 --> 19:56.075
and act like we never saw it
and never bring it up again.

19:56.110 --> 19:56.972
You sure?

19:57.073 --> 19:58.691
- 'Cause, I'm like, this is the whole thing.
- I am positive, dude!

19:58.726 --> 20:00.776
You didn't see this guy! He had pecs...

20:00.877 --> 20:02.878
Like, they were bigger than my boobs!

20:02.979 --> 20:04.179
God.

20:04.280 --> 20:08.550
To be that horny and move so
efficiently is something that,

20:08.651 --> 20:12.020
you know, even though
I hate him, I admire.

20:12.555 --> 20:14.323
So, sex!

20:14.424 --> 20:17.593
Sex with Blake Griffin, dude,
you didn't even talk about it.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.629
It wasn't full peena-vageena.

20:20.730 --> 20:21.830
Penis in vagina.

20:21.931 --> 20:24.099
That sucks. Is it... Was it okay?

20:24.200 --> 20:27.536
It was awesome. We did stuff that
I never even thought of before.

20:27.637 --> 20:30.172
All I gotta say, it was nothing but net.

20:30.273 --> 20:31.407
Oh!

20:31.508 --> 20:34.231
And by nothing but net, I mean
he fingered me 'til I (bleep).

20:34.266 --> 20:35.043
Wow.

20:35.145 --> 20:37.146
Lincoln loved it, even.
He thought it was so hot.

20:37.247 --> 20:38.597
You told Lincoln?

20:38.632 --> 20:39.882
Was he jealous?

20:39.983 --> 20:41.547
I think he was okay with it.

20:43.186 --> 20:44.253
Thank you.

20:44.354 --> 20:45.387
Mm-hmm.

20:45.488 --> 20:47.656
This is Blake Griffin's shoe.

20:47.757 --> 20:49.591
Now I use it as a murse.

20:49.692 --> 20:51.460
A male purse.

20:51.561 --> 20:53.295
We're Eskimo brothers.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.197
Heh heh heh.

21:01.237 --> 21:03.339
I'm so happy to be home.

21:03.440 --> 21:06.179
I have frosting in
every one of my crevices.

21:06.214 --> 21:07.609
Ilana?

21:07.711 --> 21:09.778
(coughing)

21:09.879 --> 21:12.214
(woman slowly speaking Japanese)

21:12.669 --> 21:14.274
(phone app, translating)
What's up, bitch?

21:15.305 --> 21:21.661
