<i>So, Axl was back</i>
<i>for winter semester,</i>

00:07.854 --> 00:09.873
<i>and this time,</i>
<i>he was hitting it hard.</i>

00:10.006 --> 00:10.844
Ow!

00:14.564 --> 00:16.077
<i>You see, Axl and Hutch</i>
<i>had been embroiled</i>

00:16.207 --> 00:18.999
<i>in an epic finger-slap war</i>
<i>for weeks</i>

00:19.115 --> 00:20.645
<i>with no winner in sight.</i>

00:20.865 --> 00:22.652
<i>At this point,</i>
<i>it was going from open warfare</i>

00:22.741 --> 00:25.469
<i>to a covert operation</i>
<i>inside enemy territory.</i>

00:26.382 --> 00:28.970
So resulting in...

00:30.194 --> 00:31.663
Yes? You there?

00:31.939 --> 00:33.072
What is your name, sir?

00:33.168 --> 00:35.520
Uh, Axl.

00:35.807 --> 00:37.556
Well, "Uh, Axl,"

00:37.700 --> 00:39.466
given what we know
about the theory of relativity

00:39.547 --> 00:41.041
and how it predicts
that a compact mass

00:41.117 --> 00:43.097
will deform space
in an energy vortex,

00:43.214 --> 00:46.707
what will this create?
And explain.

00:47.396 --> 00:49.406
This will, uh

00:49.484 --> 00:51.587
predict and explain...

00:52.593 --> 00:53.775
a black hole,

00:54.113 --> 00:55.621
defined
as a region of space-time

00:55.703 --> 00:58.407
where gravity prevents anything,
even light, from escaping.

00:58.847 --> 01:01.741
Wow. I actually
reached someone. Hm.

01:01.912 --> 01:02.730
Now I'm almost glad

01:02.832 --> 01:05.416
they defunded the space program
so I can be here.

01:05.767 --> 01:06.972
You may sit.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.309
Uh...

01:08.638 --> 01:10.918
<i>No, Axl wasn't</i>
<i>an astronomy genius.</i>

01:11.000 --> 01:13.122
<i>He just happened to watch</i>
<i>"Hot Tub Time Machine"</i>

01:13.215 --> 01:14.707
<i>27 times.</i>

01:15.242 --> 01:16.044
Hi.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.867
Yes. Once again, negotiations
with the bus drivers

01:19.987 --> 01:21.501
have stalled.

01:21.635 --> 01:25.185
Those big whiners are still
holding out for a living wage.

01:25.302 --> 01:26.496
But not to worry.

01:26.608 --> 01:27.879
We broke the janitors' union,

01:27.970 --> 01:30.456
and we will break
these people, too.

01:30.665 --> 01:34.151
So, as of Monday,
there will be no bus service,

01:34.250 --> 01:37.690
and in order to minimize
inconvenience to me,

01:37.831 --> 01:40.843
we suggest forming carpools!

01:40.948 --> 01:42.066
Carpool?!

01:42.234 --> 01:44.155
Wait a minute!
Wait, wait. What?

01:44.260 --> 01:45.806
Find somebody.
Find anybody.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.263
We're full!
We're full!

01:50.846 --> 01:52.116
- Hey--
- Full!

01:54.348 --> 01:56.262
Oh, hey!
There you are.

01:56.396 --> 01:57.433
I've been looking all over.

01:57.541 --> 02:00.162
So, Nancy, we carpool buddies,
neighbor?

02:00.449 --> 02:01.135
What?

02:01.244 --> 02:03.044
Oh, I kind of already said
I would with Bill.

02:03.135 --> 02:04.743
Oh, that's okay.
Bill's cool with it.

02:04.828 --> 02:06.244
We're good friends.
Right, Bill?

02:06.322 --> 02:06.942
Uh--

02:07.033 --> 02:08.231
See?
He's good with it.

02:08.315 --> 02:10.612
Hey, carpool!
We got a carpool!

02:10.702 --> 02:11.583
- Oh!
- Hey.

02:11.687 --> 02:12.955
Keep walking.
We're full.

02:13.069 --> 02:14.136
Hey, hey!

02:14.216 --> 02:16.345
For tomorrow, though,
pages 33 and 34

02:16.423 --> 02:17.435
from your textbooks.

02:17.569 --> 02:19.693
And I am talking to no one.

02:20.782 --> 02:22.292
Hey, you're Axl, right?

02:22.665 --> 02:23.249
Yes.

02:23.328 --> 02:24.224
- Zoe.
- Ah!

02:24.309 --> 02:26.414
You were really on it today
with that answer.

02:26.660 --> 02:27.930
Well, yeah.
Well, you know?

02:28.041 --> 02:30.462
Space-- that's where
everything's headed.

02:30.546 --> 02:31.688
Good to know about it.

02:31.793 --> 02:34.060
I mean, you really
seemed to be knowledgeable,

02:34.139 --> 02:36.373
and I'm just dying in there.

02:36.871 --> 02:37.712
Ah, sorry.

02:37.794 --> 02:39.078
I've got my roommate's bra on,

02:39.158 --> 02:41.124
and she's, like,
way smaller than me.

02:41.558 --> 02:43.842
Anyway, I'm so behind,
and I was wondering,

02:43.949 --> 02:45.680
would you like to start
a study group?

02:46.065 --> 02:47.002
Oh, uh,
he's not even--

02:47.079 --> 02:48.100
Yes, sure.
Definitely.

02:48.188 --> 02:49.379
I love to study.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.913
- And I especially like to do it in a group.
- Okay, great.

02:52.013 --> 02:53.759
We'll figure out the details
after class tomorrow.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.268
This will be awesome.
See you later.

02:56.575 --> 02:57.485
Bye.

02:58.241 --> 03:00.457
Yeah.
That sure will be awesome.

03:00.649 --> 03:02.456
But you do know
you're not in this class?

03:02.593 --> 03:03.701
Oh, I am now.

03:08.002 --> 03:08.869
Listen,
this week's a little crazy,

03:08.960 --> 03:11.321
so Tuesday I'm gonna need you
to pick Sue up from work.

03:11.455 --> 03:12.748
Got it.
Where's that again?

03:13.164 --> 03:14.593
Seriously, Mike?

03:14.739 --> 03:16.278
You don't know
where your daughter works?

03:16.544 --> 03:17.569
I think that's sad.

03:17.662 --> 03:18.770
I think <i>you're</i> sad.

03:18.924 --> 03:20.393
Well, we're all sad.
That's a given.

03:20.465 --> 03:21.903
So, where does
your daughter work?

03:23.156 --> 03:25.538
I know it's potatoes, Frankie.

03:25.633 --> 03:28.008
We've been eating her funky
potato rejects for weeks.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.326
I just don't know where it is.

03:29.408 --> 03:31.719
It's Spudsy Malone's
at the mall, okay?

03:31.807 --> 03:32.499
And then after,

03:32.587 --> 03:34.342
she needs to go
to her J-P-la meeting, so--

03:35.460 --> 03:37.517
Who's the jerk
that keeps honking their car--

03:37.600 --> 03:38.736
Crap!

03:38.826 --> 03:39.958
Brick! Carpool!

03:40.063 --> 03:42.415
Carpool!

03:42.972 --> 03:44.161
Hey, Nancy,
we'll be right there.

03:44.239 --> 03:45.312
He's just tying his shoe.

03:45.850 --> 03:47.031
Wake up!

03:47.947 --> 03:50.377
<i>Yeah, carpool got off</i>
<i>to a bit of a rocky start,</i>

03:50.528 --> 03:52.370
but soon we fell into a rhythm.

03:52.478 --> 03:54.565
<i>Nancy</i>
<i>was the delicious carpool.</i>

03:54.818 --> 03:56.007
I hope everyone likes

03:56.092 --> 03:58.844
fresh-baked
chocolate-chip muffins...

03:59.290 --> 04:02.023
and "Madagascar 3"!

04:03.569 --> 04:05.304
<i>Bill was the fun carpool.</i>

04:05.617 --> 04:07.940
Stoplight!
You know what that means--

04:08.159 --> 04:10.008
time for
"Stoplight car-dance!"

04:10.126 --> 04:12.607
♪ Brother Tony
with the tenor saxophone ♪

04:12.696 --> 04:16.223
♪ is just a shy boy
smokin' in the morning sun ♪

04:16.380 --> 04:18.567
<i>And I was, well...</i>

04:18.702 --> 04:19.625
We're late.

04:19.721 --> 04:21.214
I've never, ever been late
in my life!

04:21.320 --> 04:23.461
You don't know that, Dotty.
We're not there yet.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.224
Mom, you forgot my lunch.

04:25.348 --> 04:26.473
Oh, crap!

04:26.573 --> 04:29.459
Okay, not a problem.
We'll build a lunch.

04:29.706 --> 04:32.403
Everybody, get ready.
I'm hitting the brakes.

04:35.468 --> 04:36.626
So, how'd we do?

04:36.715 --> 04:38.051
I found a French fry.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.225
Ooh.
Cough drop.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.629
Your car is filthy.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.904
Yes, well, if I had cleaned it,
Brick wouldn't have a lunch,

04:42.975 --> 04:44.083
now, would he, Ella?

04:44.166 --> 04:46.904
I found an orange
and half a granola bar. Sweet.

04:47.076 --> 04:49.369
We're gonna be late!
It's 7:56!

04:49.478 --> 04:51.523
Relax, Dotty.
We're gonna be fine.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.519
Everybody hang on
to Dotty's seat belt.

04:53.603 --> 04:54.852
It's the only good one.

04:58.747 --> 05:00.942
Hey, hey, hey!
Look at this!

05:01.180 --> 05:01.969
Whoa.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.233
Are those
IU basketball tickets?

05:04.326 --> 05:05.119
Yeah.

05:05.201 --> 05:06.553
Four seats
to the Michigan game.

05:06.658 --> 05:07.630
Corporate just sent them
over to me

05:07.707 --> 05:09.725
for going six months
without a workplace injury.

05:10.015 --> 05:11.944
Well, what about
when the salt from that pretzel

05:12.088 --> 05:13.747
slit my tongue?

05:14.436 --> 05:15.926
You can submit forms
all day, Jim.

05:16.037 --> 05:17.572
You're not getting
workman's comp.

05:17.693 --> 05:19.182
Sure.
Make light.

05:19.261 --> 05:21.409
I still can't drink
orange juice.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.682
Hey, if you're looking
for someone to go with you,

05:23.849 --> 05:25.512
I'm free.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.221
Hold on.
You're taking Jim?!

05:27.341 --> 05:29.818
I'm the one who usually
gets injured around here!

05:30.086 --> 05:32.785
If anyone gets to go to the game
with Mike, it should be me.

05:32.912 --> 05:33.848
Look, guys--

05:33.932 --> 05:35.428
I invited you
to Metal-Fest,

05:35.522 --> 05:38.230
Metal-Mania,
Hedonism II in Jamaica.

05:38.473 --> 05:39.690
The Chuck's starting to think

05:39.766 --> 05:40.974
you don't want to hang out
with the Chuck

05:41.060 --> 05:43.597
when all the Chuck has done
is really just put himself

05:43.688 --> 05:44.807
out there, man.

05:44.896 --> 05:45.848
Mike's old!

05:45.935 --> 05:47.531
He doesn't want to go
to Metal-Fest!

05:47.722 --> 05:50.729
Besides, I'm the one
that he usually does stuff with.

05:50.811 --> 05:52.293
Well, that makes you
a boss-hog.

05:52.384 --> 05:53.349
- And a kiss-up.
- He went to my church.

05:53.447 --> 05:54.435
- You know what?
- We're text-message buddies.

05:54.557 --> 05:56.148
...a lot more chill
at work.

05:56.245 --> 05:57.955
Guys.

05:58.315 --> 06:02.598
Hey, guys, look, I'm not taking
anybody from work, okay?

06:07.276 --> 06:08.306
You know what?

06:08.457 --> 06:10.400
We may not have had
a workplace injury,

06:10.583 --> 06:12.845
but we do have
an internal one...

06:14.307 --> 06:15.736
right here.

06:22.915 --> 06:23.935
Hey.

06:24.023 --> 06:24.845
Whoa!

06:24.909 --> 06:26.358
Be cool, man.
Not here to hit you.

06:26.444 --> 06:28.604
I need your book.
Got to study up on my astronomy.

06:28.814 --> 06:30.919
Studying up
for study group! Ahh!

06:31.099 --> 06:33.049
Okay, I get
why you're doing this.

06:33.198 --> 06:35.267
That Zoe is a hot-tay!

06:35.400 --> 06:36.771
But, hey,
I'm actually in the class.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.912
Nobody invited me.

06:37.996 --> 06:40.561
That's cold--
cold as ice!

06:40.645 --> 06:42.023
Well, maybe if you paid
a little bit more attention

06:42.124 --> 06:44.421
during "Hot Tub Time Machine,"
you would have been invited.

06:44.519 --> 06:46.199
Now, let's say we learn me
some astronomy.

06:46.464 --> 06:48.442
And just to confirm,
that is the planet one

06:48.586 --> 06:50.742
and not the horoscope one,
right?

<i>All those years we spent</i>
<i>trying to get Axl to study,</i>

07:01.990 --> 07:03.481
and all it took was a hot girl.

07:03.630 --> 07:05.331
<i>It seems so obvious now.</i>

07:05.440 --> 07:06.972
And so the Cat's Eye nebula

07:07.094 --> 07:09.635
is in the constellation Draco,
the dragon.

07:09.728 --> 07:11.232
Easily remembered by the fact

07:11.333 --> 07:13.036
that we're
the East Indiana Dragons--

07:13.125 --> 07:15.516
you know, the team
that I play football on.

07:15.607 --> 07:17.481
Wow, Axl.
That's so smart.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.385
We're the Dragons,
and Draco's a dragon.

07:20.513 --> 07:21.366
Yeah.

07:21.459 --> 07:22.986
What do you know?
Gym Shorts got one.

07:23.158 --> 07:26.647
Also, Draco's 3,300 light-years
away from Earth.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.264
You know that's gonna be
on the test.

07:28.348 --> 07:29.141
Do we, Aaron?

07:29.217 --> 07:31.188
Do we really know
what's gonna be on a test?

07:31.276 --> 07:32.659
'Cause I feel it's best
to just study hard

07:32.768 --> 07:35.148
and be prepared
for any eventuality.

07:35.232 --> 07:37.133
Oh, I'm never gonna get
all of this.

07:39.217 --> 07:43.659
Oh! I am so tight
from sitting.

07:45.002 --> 07:45.804
Anyway,

07:45.902 --> 07:47.860
what did people get for
number six in the study guide?

07:47.963 --> 07:49.735
Um, that would be
the, um--

07:50.100 --> 07:51.060
Ring nebula,

07:51.305 --> 07:52.628
which is formed
by ionized gas--

07:52.695 --> 07:53.549
I got this, Gym Shorts.

07:53.652 --> 07:55.019
The ionized gas is expelled

07:55.111 --> 07:56.519
into the surrounding
interstellar medium,

07:56.636 --> 07:58.029
- which then causes a large--
- I think what Aaron's trying--

07:58.131 --> 08:00.195
Aah! Dude!

08:00.278 --> 08:01.037
I am so sorry.

08:01.128 --> 08:02.124
Do you have quarters
for laundry?

08:02.211 --> 08:03.379
'Cause you're gonna want to wash
those pants.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.898
Seriously, that stain
is in a really weird place.

08:06.676 --> 08:08.176
Oh, man.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.736
Good guy.

08:11.837 --> 08:13.620
So, um, Halley's comet.

08:13.707 --> 08:14.713
<i>Axl was lucky.</i>

08:14.800 --> 08:16.467
<i>He only had one person</i>
<i>mad at him.</i>

08:16.562 --> 08:17.801
<i>I had three.</i>

08:20.668 --> 08:21.378
Damn it!

08:21.470 --> 08:23.838
I let you stay up late to watch
the finale of "Shark Tank"

08:23.934 --> 08:26.089
after you promised me
you would wake up early!

08:26.515 --> 08:27.481
What are you doing?

08:27.756 --> 08:29.442
I'm jazzing up breakfast
with a banana.

08:29.628 --> 08:31.447
Oh, no.
Breakfast is over.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.467
Here.
You can have it for lunch.

08:34.299 --> 08:35.313
Axl says
he can't go to the game

08:35.428 --> 08:38.236
'cause he's boning up
for some big astronomy test.

08:38.331 --> 08:39.510
Did you know
he was taking astronomy?

08:39.583 --> 08:40.604
Of course I know
he's taking astronomy.

08:40.693 --> 08:42.649
- I'm his mother.
- I'll go!

08:42.746 --> 08:43.818
What about Rusty?

08:43.929 --> 08:44.966
I'm not taking my brother.

08:45.053 --> 08:47.214
He'll sneak in beers
and try to sell them to minors.

08:47.285 --> 08:48.596
Mom won't let me eat breakfast.

08:48.691 --> 08:49.513
Well, I'm sure you're learning

08:49.593 --> 08:50.714
whatever lesson
you're supposed to learn.

08:52.131 --> 08:53.490
Wait!
My pagoda project!

08:53.587 --> 08:55.116
I didn't finish!

08:55.688 --> 08:56.778
Pagoda!

08:58.025 --> 08:58.801
Sorry.

08:58.886 --> 08:59.928
Sorry.

09:00.249 --> 09:01.605
This won't take but a sec.

09:01.847 --> 09:04.445
Here, Dotty.
Hold that till it dries.

09:04.526 --> 09:05.760
Whoa!

09:06.410 --> 09:08.381
Rough morning.
Won't happen again.

09:09.277 --> 09:10.442
<i>But it did.</i>

09:15.888 --> 09:16.534
Damn it!

09:16.603 --> 09:17.907
I let you stay up late
to watch "Undercover Boss"

09:18.021 --> 09:19.440
'cause you said
you could handle it.

09:19.554 --> 09:20.812
Now, where are your shoes?!

09:20.906 --> 09:22.198
I was hoping you'd know.

09:22.355 --> 09:23.569
Rusty's out, too.

09:23.666 --> 09:25.757
He's not allowed
on the IU campus anymore.

09:25.852 --> 09:27.154
Apparently,
he <i>did</i> do that beer thing.

09:27.270 --> 09:28.008
I'll go.

09:28.086 --> 09:29.326
Why don't you just take my dad?

09:29.435 --> 09:30.652
Why don't I just take poison?

09:31.046 --> 09:32.276
Found them.

09:32.505 --> 09:33.828
Now, what did I do
with my coat?

09:34.722 --> 09:35.985
This is Sue's coat.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.108
It's the coat that's here!

09:37.384 --> 09:39.158
Sorry, Nancy.
Rough morning.

09:39.251 --> 09:40.414
It won't happen again.

09:40.950 --> 09:42.621
<i>Yeah, you know how this goes.</i>

09:47.049 --> 09:48.676
Damn it. I told you
not to let me stay up

09:48.764 --> 09:50.677
and watch
"House Hunters International."

09:50.794 --> 09:53.859
Who knew Prague was
so affordable and cosmopolitan?

09:53.956 --> 09:55.846
I can't believe it.
Even your dad has plans.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.887
He's trying to figure out
which pill makes him dizzy.

09:58.029 --> 09:58.970
I'll go!

09:59.055 --> 10:01.238
What about that guy at
the gas station? You guys chat.

10:01.532 --> 10:02.480
That's a woman.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.991
And we're not close.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.675
I guess I'm down
to asking Brick.

10:07.034 --> 10:08.676
Who am I kidding?
He's not gonna want to go.

10:08.785 --> 10:09.818
I'll go!

10:09.902 --> 10:10.950
Go where?

10:11.033 --> 10:12.449
To the game.

10:12.526 --> 10:14.409
There you go.
Take Sue.

10:14.785 --> 10:16.119
Where's my stupid coat?

10:16.425 --> 10:18.397
Uh, are you sure
you want to go?

10:18.512 --> 10:20.628
These are floor seats, Sue,
against Michigan.

10:20.711 --> 10:22.139
You got
to really watch the game.

10:22.272 --> 10:24.147
I will.
I promise!

10:24.684 --> 10:26.708
Okay, fine.
But from now on, speak up.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.750
I was this close to going
with Tag.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.073
Damn.

10:39.538 --> 10:40.328
I was gonna hit you,
but it looked like

10:40.420 --> 10:41.890
somebody beat me to it.

10:41.994 --> 10:43.459
What's going on?
I haven't seen you in days.

10:43.545 --> 10:44.574
I'm dying here, man.

10:44.658 --> 10:45.756
I'm crapping out
in my real classes

10:45.851 --> 10:47.269
'cause I'm spending so much time
studying for a class

10:47.344 --> 10:49.247
I'm not even taking
just to hook up with a girl.

10:49.668 --> 10:52.176
Now, when I say it out loud,
it does actually make sense.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.510
I can't keep this up.

10:53.613 --> 10:55.616
Kenny, you got to help me, man.
You got to help me, Kenny!

10:55.694 --> 10:58.608
Kenny!
Hey, game over, man.

10:58.689 --> 10:59.805
Time to pull the rip cord.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.565
- You got to come clean with this chick.
- No.

11:01.691 --> 11:03.555
It's been so long since
I touched a girl, Hutch.

11:03.661 --> 11:04.562
I thought
when I came to college,

11:04.651 --> 11:06.554
it'd be this buffet of women
from all around the world--

11:06.643 --> 11:08.902
Kentucky, Illinois,
Northern Illinois--

11:08.991 --> 11:10.690
- but it isn't, man. It just isn't!
- Okay!

11:15.590 --> 11:17.965
What does a heart attack
feel like?

11:19.917 --> 11:20.934
Hey, Sue.

11:21.011 --> 11:22.746
Oh, hey! Good news--
you're off the hook.

11:22.826 --> 11:23.992
Turns out Greg from softball

11:24.091 --> 11:25.150
can make it to the game
after all.

11:25.659 --> 11:26.979
Oh, really?

11:27.079 --> 11:28.014
Yeah.
So you got more time

11:28.108 --> 11:30.115
to do the other stuff
that you like to do.

11:30.218 --> 11:32.712
And your mom will be around,
so it's good.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.265
Oh, okay.

11:38.845 --> 11:40.053
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

11:40.168 --> 11:41.323
We'll be there in a second.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.876
Brick, carpool!

11:43.000 --> 11:44.900
Frankie, it's dinner time.

11:45.129 --> 11:46.686
Oh.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.325
Well, we can always
use the practice.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.738
Yeah.
About that...

11:51.917 --> 11:54.666
I just wondered if you could be
a little more on time.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.287
You've been running
a little late this past week,

11:56.364 --> 11:57.788
and, well, it's probably Dotty.

11:57.878 --> 11:59.096
She's kind of a nervous Nellie.

11:59.217 --> 12:01.930
So, if you could, you know,
try to be on time.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.696
Oh, gosh, sure.
I can do that.

12:03.818 --> 12:05.495
Thank you so much.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.759
Oh, and, also, when you're
picking up from school,

12:07.841 --> 12:10.388
if you could maybe just be a
little more on time then, too.

12:10.624 --> 12:12.366
Dotty gets scared
when she's still there

12:12.466 --> 12:13.988
after the teachers go home.

12:14.072 --> 12:15.178
Of course.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.265
Still adjusting
to that time change.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.008
Why don't they
just leave it alone, right?

12:19.136 --> 12:20.188
Right.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.054
Oh, and just one more
tiny thing.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.198
Uh-huh.

12:23.292 --> 12:25.601
If you could maybe pack a little
bit more in Brick's lunch.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.703
He's been begging the girls
for food on the way to school.

12:28.806 --> 12:30.055
Got it, got it, got it.
More lunch.

12:30.133 --> 12:31.621
Anyway, good talk.

12:31.696 --> 12:33.017
It's been a rough week.
Thanks for understanding.

12:44.524 --> 12:45.531
Hey.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.014
Hey.
How was the game?

12:48.417 --> 12:49.205
Great.

12:49.295 --> 12:52.023
Unbelievable seats.
IU won it in overtime.

12:52.111 --> 12:54.161
Mm-hmm.
And did Sue like it?

12:54.270 --> 12:55.943
Uh, didn't take her.
Greg got free.

12:56.014 --> 12:57.612
He moved his wife's C-section
to Friday.

12:57.784 --> 13:00.166
Yeah.
I know you didn't take Sue.

13:00.255 --> 13:03.004
We microwaved pancakes
and read <i>People</i> magazine.

13:03.091 --> 13:04.184
Oh, good.

13:04.271 --> 13:05.906
No, it's not good, Mike.

13:05.976 --> 13:08.375
She really wanted to go
to the game with you.

13:08.465 --> 13:09.988
What?
No, she didn't.

13:10.057 --> 13:10.734
She just volunteered

13:10.812 --> 13:12.024
'cause I didn't have
anybody to go with.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.005
Are you that clueless?

13:14.083 --> 13:15.794
It wasn't about the game
for her.

13:15.853 --> 13:17.701
It was a special night
with her dad,

13:17.895 --> 13:21.443
eating cotton candy,
getting a cute t-shirt, talking.

13:21.530 --> 13:23.930
Yeah, none of those things should
happen at a basketball game.

13:24.060 --> 13:26.611
Look, I saved her from a miserable night.

13:26.687 --> 13:27.719
She would have been bored.

13:27.897 --> 13:29.941
Why? 'Cause she's a girl?

13:30.027 --> 13:30.854
Come on, Frankie.

13:30.923 --> 13:33.573
For the most part,
girls are not gonna be

13:33.669 --> 13:35.730
as into a game
as a guy would be.

13:35.821 --> 13:37.192
Are you kidding me?

13:37.277 --> 13:38.620
What is this, the '50s?

13:38.701 --> 13:40.172
I'm sorry, but that's insane.

13:40.255 --> 13:42.078
Girls like sports, Mike.

13:42.209 --> 13:43.906
Why would my dad
have taken me and my sister

13:43.998 --> 13:46.371
to all those
Indianapolis Indians games?

13:46.614 --> 13:49.112
'Cause he didn't have any sons, and
he wanted to go to an Indians game.

13:49.322 --> 13:50.952
So you're saying
if I had a brother,

13:51.032 --> 13:53.291
my dad would have taken me
to less games?

13:53.382 --> 13:56.200
No. I'm saying he would have
taken you to <i>no</i> games.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.514
Wow.

13:57.631 --> 14:00.146
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

14:00.226 --> 14:01.608
Yeah, you can "Wow"
all you want,

14:01.720 --> 14:02.872
but you're just as guilty.

14:02.948 --> 14:04.668
You never took Axl to a play.

14:05.155 --> 14:06.757
I've never taken anyone
to a play.

14:07.184 --> 14:10.427
Okay, then, uh,
how about the ice capades?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.029
You took Sue to the ice capades

14:12.121 --> 14:14.142
and never thought about
asking Axl.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.728
Oh, yeah, like I'm gonna get Axl
to put on pants

14:16.828 --> 14:19.050
to watch princesses skate
on ice.

14:19.474 --> 14:21.114
You don't know.
He might have loved it.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.134
Could have taken up skating,
become a gold medalist,

14:23.244 --> 14:24.589
- bought us a house.
- No, no.

14:24.673 --> 14:25.962
Don't try and turn this on me.

14:26.081 --> 14:28.475
Face it-- you don't have
a leg to stand on.

14:28.616 --> 14:30.998
Oh, I got legs--
two of them, just like Axl--

14:31.071 --> 14:32.535
that might have been perfect
for ice skating,

14:32.617 --> 14:35.191
only we'll never know 'cause
you took Sue to ice capades.

14:35.282 --> 14:36.921
Hey, I still do stuff with Axl.

14:37.004 --> 14:39.844
When is the last time you did
anything like that with Sue?

14:39.955 --> 14:41.287
Hey, I spend time with Sue.

14:41.377 --> 14:43.224
I watched her play volleyball,
Frankie.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.013
Got her checked out
at the emergency room.

14:45.094 --> 14:46.915
I'm just saying,
you don't know where she works.

14:47.018 --> 14:49.467
You have no idea
what J-P-la is.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.725
Nobody does.

14:51.221 --> 14:52.303
Look, I'm a good dad.

14:52.403 --> 14:54.195
I'm not gonna stand here
and let you make me feel bad.

14:54.299 --> 14:56.305
Stupid tickets.
I should have taken Dave.

14:57.342 --> 14:58.762
Leaving doesn't make it right.

14:58.841 --> 15:00.079
Makes you quieter.

15:01.239 --> 15:03.417
<i>I did worry</i>
<i>I was a little harsh with Mike.</i>

15:03.554 --> 15:06.408
<i>Unfortunately, I was up</i>
<i>all night worrying about it,</i>

15:06.521 --> 15:07.869
<i>which meant...</i>

15:11.906 --> 15:14.343
Oh, come on!
Let's go!

15:14.496 --> 15:16.300
We have a quiz first period,
you know.

15:16.561 --> 15:19.488
It's really important.
It's 12% of our grade.

15:19.564 --> 15:20.992
"12% of our grade."

15:21.616 --> 15:22.506
Nerd.

15:22.721 --> 15:24.682
Listen, we're gonna make it.
We got plenty of time.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.257
Just regular bread today?
No baguette?

15:28.600 --> 15:30.223
Tell your mom I'm not a fan.

15:30.741 --> 15:32.222
We left too late.

15:32.721 --> 15:34.034
My mom and dad were talking

15:34.134 --> 15:35.625
about your mom
always being late,

15:35.698 --> 15:38.573
and my dad said
your mom's a real case.

15:40.474 --> 15:42.606
Hey, could you move over?!

15:42.691 --> 15:44.534
We're kind of in a hurry here!

15:44.626 --> 15:45.958
We should be there already!

15:46.041 --> 15:47.062
We're gonna miss the quiz!

15:47.154 --> 15:48.562
I'm gonna get my first zero!

15:48.657 --> 15:50.156
Would you calm down, Dotty?

15:50.262 --> 15:51.584
It's middle school.

15:51.912 --> 15:53.775
You know, I read that schools
test too much anyway.

15:53.878 --> 15:55.705
It's all just a race
to nowhere.

15:56.046 --> 15:57.656
We're all gonna get
tardies now.

15:57.768 --> 15:59.790
We won't be able to go
to the no-tardy party,

15:59.990 --> 16:01.989
and there's ice cream,
and we get to wear a badge

16:02.076 --> 16:03.720
that says we're in
the no-tardy club!

16:03.807 --> 16:06.690
Look, you're all gonna go
to the no-tardy party, okay?

16:06.773 --> 16:08.407
I've got this covered.
I can do it.

16:20.082 --> 16:22.042
Hey, lucky us.

16:22.245 --> 16:23.464
Looks like you got
a couple extra minutes

16:23.551 --> 16:25.302
to study for that quiz, so...

16:26.035 --> 16:27.646
You know, are you sure
you want to--

16:28.023 --> 16:30.423
Ah, all right.
Now, good luck on that quiz.

16:30.678 --> 16:33.612
And, hey, we don't have to tell
your parents about this, right?

16:39.796 --> 16:41.492
<i>Mike didn't want to hear it</i>
<i>at the time,</i>

16:41.698 --> 16:42.912
<i>but the more</i>
<i>he thought about it,</i>

16:43.001 --> 16:45.101
<i>the more he realized</i>
<i>maybe he didn't always give Sue</i>

16:45.198 --> 16:46.851
<i>the attention he should have.</i>

16:48.061 --> 16:49.538
Heading out
to paint the garage.

16:49.664 --> 16:50.567
I'll go!

16:50.663 --> 16:52.212
No. I got to get this
done fast.

16:56.132 --> 16:57.231
Going to the hardware store.

16:57.393 --> 16:58.361
Come on, Axl.

16:59.006 --> 17:00.061
I'll go!

17:02.491 --> 17:03.395
I'm gonna go get milk.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.281
I'll go!

17:04.391 --> 17:06.709
Oh, great.
No sense both of us going.

17:25.154 --> 17:27.268
Hey.
Home from school, huh?

17:27.364 --> 17:28.428
Yep.

17:29.436 --> 17:31.240
No, uh,
J-P-la tonight?

17:31.624 --> 17:32.382
Nope.

17:32.630 --> 17:34.698
Yeah.
Uh-huh.

17:35.938 --> 17:37.821
You have to work today
at the potato place

17:37.930 --> 17:39.562
on the third floor of the mall?

17:39.942 --> 17:42.539
No. I'm picking up
a double shift on Saturday.

17:42.791 --> 17:44.773
Dad, why are you talking to me?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.547
No reason.

17:48.918 --> 17:50.945
Hey, you know, uh...

17:51.036 --> 17:52.993
I was thinking
about going to get a burger

17:53.074 --> 17:54.657
- for dinner.
- I'll go!

17:54.827 --> 17:56.046
No, Sue.
You don't have to volunteer.

17:56.306 --> 17:59.244
I was asking you if you
want to go with me to dinner.

17:59.339 --> 18:00.860
Oh, I get it.

18:00.961 --> 18:04.005
You mean you'll sit in the car
while I run in and go get it.

18:04.131 --> 18:07.076
No. I'm-- I'm asking you
to dinner--

18:07.168 --> 18:09.682
you, me, in a restaurant,
just the two of us.

18:10.244 --> 18:12.284
What's wrong?
Is mom sick?

18:12.426 --> 18:13.446
Are <i>you</i> sick?

18:13.538 --> 18:14.576
Is grandma sick?

18:14.740 --> 18:16.012
Am <i>I</i> sick?!

18:16.107 --> 18:17.352
Nobody's sick.

18:17.469 --> 18:18.425
Oh, no!

18:18.530 --> 18:19.814
You and mom
are getting a divorce.

18:19.907 --> 18:20.598
I knew it.

18:20.694 --> 18:21.844
Are you ready
for a younger woman?

18:22.014 --> 18:24.304
God, no.
She'd want kids.

18:24.398 --> 18:26.493
Look, Sue, nobody's sick,
no divorces.

18:26.569 --> 18:28.611
I just want to grab a burger
with you.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.410
Really?!

18:30.493 --> 18:31.512
Yeah.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.015
Okay!

18:34.095 --> 18:36.069
This is gonna be so much fun!

18:36.315 --> 18:37.306
But no potatoes.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.873
I am so over potatoes.

18:44.112 --> 18:45.843
Okay, I, like,
always get this wrong.

18:46.027 --> 18:48.721
Which planet has the hottest
surface temperature?

18:49.226 --> 18:50.869
What?

18:50.972 --> 18:52.261
Sorry.
It's hard to concentrate

18:52.347 --> 18:54.353
'cause I'm sitting next to
a hot planet right now.

18:58.906 --> 19:00.525
Wow.
You're good at that.

19:00.655 --> 19:02.149
But there is a test tomorrow,

19:02.232 --> 19:04.416
- and we really should stay focused.
- Right.

19:04.548 --> 19:05.622
Right.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.827
Uh-- pbht!--
Venus is the hottest,

19:07.901 --> 19:09.793
due to the greenhouse effect.

19:09.894 --> 19:11.442
Great. Uh, now,

19:11.736 --> 19:14.271
what planet's gravitational pull
is so strong,

19:14.352 --> 19:17.614
it easily attracts asteroids
and comets into its atmosphere?

19:17.869 --> 19:19.040
That'd be Jupiter.

19:19.122 --> 19:21.702
But your gravitational pull
is much stronger.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.087
Axl, please.
You're not making this easy.

19:28.188 --> 19:29.718
There's plenty of time
for that later.

19:29.816 --> 19:30.977
We really got to study.

19:32.274 --> 19:32.984
Hmm.

19:33.137 --> 19:34.151
Well,

19:34.249 --> 19:36.252
actually, I don't.

19:36.364 --> 19:38.865
Funny story--
I'm not actually in this class.

19:38.957 --> 19:40.865
I only pretended to be
to get to know you, so--

19:40.935 --> 19:42.146
What?

19:42.234 --> 19:44.003
- Romantic, right?
- Are you kidding me?!

19:44.159 --> 19:47.454
- I only pretended to like you
so you'd help me with the class! - What?!

19:47.568 --> 19:49.372
When we are done making out,
we are so talking about this.

19:49.468 --> 19:51.735
Oh, uh, hey.
What are you doing?

19:51.869 --> 19:53.870
Leaving.
I got to go find that Aaron guy.

19:53.974 --> 19:55.147
If I fail another class,

19:55.238 --> 19:57.355
my dad's gonna make me work
at his tile store.

19:57.451 --> 20:00.563
So you were just using me
for my brain?!

20:00.814 --> 20:02.225
Well, joke's on you,
'cause I'm barely passing

20:02.321 --> 20:03.902
any of my classes!
Wait.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.708
Do you have any hot friends
you can tell about me?!

20:06.789 --> 20:07.960
Perhaps
your small-bra'd roommate?

20:08.075 --> 20:09.383
I'm desperate!

20:10.233 --> 20:12.048
<i>So thanks to a class</i>
<i>he wasn't taking,</i>

20:12.137 --> 20:14.345
<i>Axl finally learned</i>
<i>how to study</i>

20:14.536 --> 20:16.265
<i>and decided</i>
<i>to apply that knowledge</i>

20:16.345 --> 20:17.887
<i>to the classes he was taking.</i>

20:17.992 --> 20:19.929
Oh! I'm awake!
I'm awake!

20:20.048 --> 20:21.098
Yeah, you are.

20:26.161 --> 20:28.031
Have a good day at school.

20:28.409 --> 20:30.703
<i>And I learned</i>
<i>an important lesson, too--</i>

20:30.834 --> 20:32.451
<i>if you're bad enough</i>
<i>at something,</i>

20:32.559 --> 20:34.373
<i>they'll ask you</i>
<i>not to do it anymore.</i>

20:34.452 --> 20:35.777
Oh, crap.
I'm late for work.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.396
<i>And as for Mike...</i>

20:39.703 --> 20:40.381
Where are you gonna put

20:40.465 --> 20:41.950
a bacon cheeseburger,
onion rings,

20:42.043 --> 20:43.108
and a chocolate shake?

20:43.200 --> 20:44.733
I'm starving!

20:44.891 --> 20:46.050
I missed lunch.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.129
There was a J-P-la
emergency.

20:48.223 --> 20:50.084
New freshman transferred in
from Muncie.

20:50.180 --> 20:51.786
Big transition for him.

20:51.905 --> 20:53.804
Yeah.
I can imagine.

20:53.871 --> 20:56.800
What exactly is this J-P-la
thing that you do?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.152
Your mom has no idea.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.009
Oh. It's awesome.

21:00.107 --> 21:02.557
I mentor the mentors
who mentor the freshmen.

21:02.832 --> 21:04.335
We're actually doing an assembly
on Tuesday

21:04.433 --> 21:06.054
about achieving
teen excellence.

21:06.149 --> 21:07.305
And parents can come.

21:08.028 --> 21:09.676
I told mom about it,
and she's checking.

21:09.758 --> 21:10.872
I'll go.

21:11.375 --> 21:12.746
Really?!

21:13.171 --> 21:14.249
Yeah.

21:14.612 --> 21:15.861
That would be great!

21:18.209 --> 21:20.997
But, you know, I'm not just
doing it for the assemblies.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.075
Yeah, I really do
want to help people.

21:23.297 --> 21:27.062
But it will look good
on the old college application.

21:28.637 --> 21:30.339
Thought about
where you'd like to go?

21:30.590 --> 21:32.996
Well, if I want to study
marine biology...
