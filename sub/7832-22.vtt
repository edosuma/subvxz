at your gazebo reservation form?

- Beat it!
- [ Chuckles ] Yes, well, we each have a good case.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.905
What part of''beat it''
didn't you understand?

12:30.015 --> 12:32.381
Hmm, I guess it would be the ''it.''

12:32.485 --> 12:36.319
I'm not exactly sure to what
that refers. It's- Ow!

12:36.422 --> 12:40.586
Oh, it's hopeless. There are some
she-males in gazebo three...

12:40.693 --> 12:43.025
a nasty looking spider
in gazebo six...

12:43.129 --> 12:45.723
and the less said about gazebo eight,
the better.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.822
Ah, Chief, thank God you're here.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.424
We reserved gazebo seven,
and look.

12:50.536 --> 12:53.937
Geez. How many gazebos
do you she-males need?

12:55.374 --> 12:57.740
Beer me, boys.

12:57.843 --> 13:00.607
Why do we live in a town
where the smartest have no power...

13:00.713 --> 13:02.613
and the stupidest run everything?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.683
- Maybe I should just move back to Alabama.
- No.

13:04.784 --> 13:09.244
We should fix things here. If we put our minds to it,
there's no limit to what we can accomplish.

13:09.355 --> 13:12.688
- I think the girl's right.
- Good point.

13:17.062 --> 13:19.690

- What's going on? Where's the mayor?

13:47.159 --> 13:49.423
- He skipped town.
- Really?

So, who's in charge?

13:51.864 --> 13:56.233
Well, that's a good question. Let's, uh, take
a quick look at the town charter.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.867
- [ All ] Done.
- Finished.

14:01.974 --> 14:04.101
According to the charter,
''should the mayor abdicate...

14:04.210 --> 14:07.407
a council of learned citizens
may rule in his stead.''

14:07.513 --> 14:09.538
Well, there's no one
more learned than us.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.811
So, I guess... we're in charge.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.443
What!
Let me see that.

14:15.554 --> 14:19.752
Let's see here. ''We the people,''
''cruel and unusual,'' blah, blah, blah.

''Ritual circumcision,''
yak, yak, yak.

Ah, geez,
I'll take your word for it.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.131

- [ Cheering ]

14:27.233 --> 14:29.133
With our superior intellects...

14:29.235 --> 14:32.568
we could rebuild this city on a foundation
of reason and enlightenment.

14:32.671 --> 14:34.798
We could turn Springfield
into a utopia.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.501
- A new Athens.
- Or Walden Two.

known as the ''Bright Pack''...

for the better part of three days.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.985

So, Lisa, what do you and your fellow

15:01.600 --> 15:03.500
- Business as usual?
- No, Kent.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.935
We're gonna use the power of good ideas
to change things for the better.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.065
Well, excuse this jaded reporter
if he says he's heard that before.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.769
- Oh, well, we really mean it.
- [ Gasps ] You do?

15:12.878 --> 15:15.847
Yes. For example, no one
was showing up for jury duty.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.041
So we made the experience
more exciting...

15:18.150 --> 15:20.380
by synergizing it
with his comic book collection.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.851
''You have been chosen
to join theJustice Squadron...

Fortress of Vengeance.''

15:29.295 --> 15:30.887
Oh, I am so there.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.930
We studied traffic patterns
and found that...

15:33.032 --> 15:35.899
drivers move the fastest
through yellow lights.

15:36.001 --> 15:41.439
So now, we just have the red
and yellow lights. [ Chuckles ]

15:44.743 --> 15:48.440
Come on.
Stay yellow. Stay yellow!

15:48.547 --> 15:52.313
Man, I'm making record time,
if only I had someplace to be.

15:52.418 --> 15:56.047
And we've really elevated the level
of discourse at the dog track.

15:56.155 --> 15:59.454

<i>with classical music.</i>

Oh, excellent. Not only are

16:43.836 --> 16:45.736

It's the dawn of
an enlightened Springfield.

16:52.177 --> 16:55.544
Excellent. Now, next week
is our state of the city address.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.581
Has everyone finalized
their proposals?

16:57.683 --> 17:01.119
Well, first of all, I have a plan to eliminate
obesity... in females.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.484
Oh, please. For a nickel
a person tax increase...

17:03.589 --> 17:05.614
we could build a theater
for shadow puppets.

17:05.723 --> 17:09.125
- Balinese or Thai?
- Why not both? Then everybody's happy.

17:09.228 --> 17:11.423
Oh, yeah.
Everyone's real happy then!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.589
