WEBVTT

00:07.216 --> 00:09.593
Here,
Crickety McCrickerson...

00:10.219 --> 00:11.049
Bo--

00:11.304 --> 00:12.965
Do you want to find
the Zambian cricket

00:13.222 --> 00:14.723
of good fortune or not?

00:15.933 --> 00:16.183
[Thud]

00:16.434 --> 00:17.549
Ow!

00:18.019 --> 00:21.887
I think my shins passed
"good fortune" two hours ago.

00:28.613 --> 00:29.443
Warmer.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.733
The stupid chirping is
bouncing off every wall.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.822
You need to be
able to distinguish

00:34.076 --> 00:35.156
the original
cricket sound

00:35.411 --> 00:38.118
from the echo
of its sound.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.963
Hale went
full speakeasy?

00:50.635 --> 00:51.169
Ridiculous.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.177
Shh!

00:52.428 --> 00:53.793
Warmer, Bo.

00:54.138 --> 00:55.378
Warmer.
That's good.

00:56.057 --> 00:56.967
Good, Bo.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.307
Now concentrate.

01:03.606 --> 01:04.937
Ah-ha!
Gotcha!

01:08.611 --> 01:09.771
I missed him.

01:10.196 --> 01:11.902
Again.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.568
It was behind you
the entire time.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.373
That was your
last chance

01:21.624 --> 01:23.910
to secure the
cricket's good fortune.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.284
Something you desperately
need for The Dawning.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.160
And you failed, Bo.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.628
That's a bit harsh.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.215
Perhaps you need to let
me do my job, bartender.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.476
| wish Kenzi
were here.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.890
You heard
what Stella said.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.649
Humans taint this
part of the process.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.231
I am never
gonna be ready.

01:49.485 --> 01:51.271
Don't talk like that.

01:51.529 --> 01:52.735
You're going to pull
through this just fine.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.320
You don't know that!

01:54.573 --> 01:57.610
Bo, The Dawning
isn't all horror shows

01:57.868 --> 01:59.824
and near-death
experiences.

02:00.079 --> 02:00.568
It's--

02:00.830 --> 02:02.161
Something that
we all go through.

02:02.415 --> 02:03.951
And yes, some
of it is difficult.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.744
But it is
manageable.

02:06.002 --> 02:07.492
So you have
been listening.

02:08.838 --> 02:10.794
Hale said he had
to drink six pints

02:11.048 --> 02:11.753
of sour
Lochness juice.

02:12.008 --> 02:12.793
[Laughing]

02:13.050 --> 02:14.586
And Dyson told
you about his fleas.

02:14.844 --> 02:15.879
Yeah.

02:16.137 --> 02:18.173
I guess I do have
a fighting chance.

02:18.431 --> 02:19.796
Atta girl.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.055
Alright, coach...
What's next?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.349
In order to enter
the temple

02:27.606 --> 02:29.346
you must be given
The Invitation.

02:30.026 --> 02:31.106
So now you wait.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.770
Oh, please tell
me that involves

02:33.029 --> 02:34.394
sitting on
my tired little ass.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.152
The day is yours.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.362
Yes!

02:39.035 --> 02:40.150
Trick...

02:41.620 --> 02:44.327
I owe you an apology
for my rudeness.

02:45.624 --> 02:48.286
To make it up, I'd like
to take you to dinner.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.166
Tonight.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.453
Sure.
Of course.

02:53.007 --> 02:53.962
Tonight.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.667
Wear something nice.

03:02.058 --> 03:04.970
[Phone ringing]

03:05.227 --> 03:06.637
Hey,babe.

03:09.607 --> 03:11.563
Yeah,
I miss you too.

03:15.404 --> 03:19.818
No... all I want is the
longest afternoon nap ever.

03:20.076 --> 03:22.863
Then popcorn and a movie
on the couch with you.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.788
Yeah,
I'll call you later.

03:25.831 --> 03:26.786
Love you.

03:27.041 --> 03:33.583
[Cranks turning]

03:38.010 --> 03:48.853
[Crying]

03:52.191 --> 03:54.773
Life is hard when you don't
know who you are.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.602
It's harder when you don't
know what you are.

03:58.197 --> 04:00.153
My love carries
a death sentence.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.194
l was lost for years...

04:03.452 --> 04:05.238
Searching while hiding.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.368
Only to find that I belong
to a world hidden from humans.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.741
I won't hide anymore.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.584
I will live
the life I choose.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.632
If you are a cricket,
I will totally kill you.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.850
Eek! l was on my way
over when I called--

04:31.105 --> 04:32.595
I couldn't wait
to see you.

04:32.857 --> 04:34.768
Oh, hon, me too,
but I'm so tired--

04:35.025 --> 04:36.014
How did it go today?
Did you kick ass?

04:36.277 --> 04:38.768
You look tired.
Are you a little tired?

04:39.029 --> 04:40.155
Are you on crack?

04:41.824 --> 04:43.030
Seriously, hon. Have you
been doing experiments

04:43.284 --> 04:45.616
without your respirator
thingy. Because--

04:45.870 --> 04:47.280
Look!

04:48.831 --> 04:50.787
"We congratulate you
on being the recipient

04:51.041 --> 04:53.248
"of The Moses Gomberg
Distinguished Award

04:53.502 --> 04:55.083
"for Outstanding
Contribution in the Field--

04:55.337 --> 04:56.713
"of Free Radicals!"

04:58.632 --> 04:59.496
The banquet is tonight?

04:59.758 --> 05:02.170
I know. I wasn't
their first choice.

05:02.428 --> 05:04.168
The award was originally
going to Michael Snoode.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.966
I take it his
science is sucky?

05:06.223 --> 05:07.133
He's a total fraud.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.597
He completely fudged
his radical numbers.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.011
It's all over
the message boards.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.225
Bo, I knew they'd have to
choose another recipient,

05:12.480 --> 05:14.061
but I didn't think
it would be me!

05:14.315 --> 05:15.851
Well, that's...
radical!

05:16.108 --> 05:17.063
You'll come
with me, right?

05:17.318 --> 05:18.899
I mean, you'll be
my plus-one?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.729
And see the sexiest scientist
in the universe celebrated?

05:22.990 --> 05:23.775
Hell yes.

05:24.033 --> 05:24.567
Eek!

05:24.825 --> 05:26.986
Okay, you go home,
get yourself all dolled up,

05:27.244 --> 05:28.074
Crack open
some bubbly.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.739
We'll hit the
pre-awards cocktails at 4,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.703
settle in for the
banquet at 5 and wait

05:31.957 --> 05:34.164
for the six o'clock acceptance
speeches to begin.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.749
Yes, we will!
Yes, we will!

05:36.003 --> 05:36.583
[Gasp!]

05:36.837 --> 05:37.792
Acceptance speeches...

05:38.047 --> 05:38.877
l have to write one.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.746
Oh my God,
I need to steam my dress.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.589
I need a dress.
Have to have a dress--

05:42.843 --> 05:44.174
Do you have a dress?

05:44.428 --> 05:45.292
l have a dress--

05:45.554 --> 05:47.385
We should both wear
dresses. I love you!

05:48.474 --> 05:49.839
Well, well, well...

05:50.643 --> 05:52.008
Aren't you two cute.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.225
Who are you
all sparkly for?

05:56.982 --> 05:58.768
I'm taking you
out to lunch.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.729
Why would you
want to do that?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.147
Because everyone's
been lying to you.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.156
This is lunch?

06:08.410 --> 06:10.742
Tomato juice,
celery, vodka...

06:10.996 --> 06:12.372
Looks like lunch to me.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.325
| always thought a Dark bar

06:14.583 --> 06:16.244
would be more
leather and spikes.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.742
With peanut shells
on the floor--

06:18.003 --> 06:19.868
For some reason,
I always saw peanut shells.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.257
But, this looks like
a Light bar to me.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.964
Except more attitude.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.087
We've got
serious attitude.

06:26.428 --> 06:29.386
Yeah, but that's not what we're
here to talk about, is it?

06:31.016 --> 06:31.641
There's a good chance

06:31.892 --> 06:33.302
you won't make it
through The Dawning.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.892
That's not
what Trick says.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.726
Or Hale, or Dyson...

06:36.981 --> 06:40.144
l have listened to them
bullshit you all week.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.356
The Dawning--

06:43.988 --> 06:45.944
The Dawning is
the most brutal thing

06:46.198 --> 06:47.734
you'll ever
go through.

06:47.992 --> 06:48.822
Times infinity.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.317
Are you trying to throw
me off my game?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.865
Because this is my life
we're talking about here.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.489
I'm trying
to help you.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.625
Oh...

07:07.886 --> 07:09.012
The leather.

07:10.639 --> 07:11.594
The leather.

07:13.642 --> 07:17.134
When in doubt...
always go with leather.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.147
Strange device.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.563
It must be Hale's.

07:29.825 --> 07:30.860
Wait--

07:31.994 --> 07:34.360
I've seen something
like this before.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.362
Though never so complex.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.204
What is it?

07:37.458 --> 07:40.370
This is Bo's invitation
to The Dawning.

07:40.628 --> 07:41.868
In the form
of a game.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.745
She must have
activated it.

07:45.007 --> 07:45.917
[Ding]

07:46.175 --> 07:47.381
lt's ready!

07:47.635 --> 07:48.966
The game has begun.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.880
We'll have
to do it for her.

07:51.138 --> 07:51.968
Do what?

07:52.222 --> 07:53.177
Play the game.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.388
Wherever she is,
whatever she's doing,

07:55.643 --> 07:56.974
the game will affect her.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.603
So what do we do?

07:59.188 --> 08:00.769
Someone else
has to play.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.813
Who?

08:03.067 --> 08:05.774
Her closest blood relative.

08:06.028 --> 08:06.778
[Machine whirring]

08:07.029 --> 08:09.190
And Bo's
immediate future...

08:09.448 --> 08:11.689
depends on you.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.202
Why didn't anyone
else tell me this?

08:17.498 --> 08:19.489
Because they are
trying to protect you.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.740
But once you're inside,
you have to know

08:22.002 --> 08:23.742
it is only you.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.585
What if I'm not
strong enough?

08:25.839 --> 08:26.794
You gotta--

08:27.424 --> 08:29.164
What's that shit called?
"Self-talk."

08:29.426 --> 08:32.793
What? Like, I'm powerful,
and brave, I'm--

08:33.055 --> 08:33.919
Bo--

08:34.181 --> 08:34.966
Right?

08:35.224 --> 08:36.259
Yeah.
That's me.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.472
l'm Pike.

08:39.228 --> 08:40.684
Gosh, I have
wanted to meet

08:40.938 --> 08:43.145
the unaligned
Succubus for years.

08:43.399 --> 08:46.482
Oh honey, if you're trying to
pick up you're going too slow.

08:46.735 --> 08:48.600
Why don't we skip to the
part where she says no,

08:48.862 --> 08:49.487
then you can scoot.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.274
Look, I don't want to
rain on anyone's parade.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.568
But my friends and |--

08:53.826 --> 08:55.566
Well, we were
wondering how you can...

08:55.828 --> 08:57.568
call yourself "unaligned"
when you're clearly Light.

08:57.830 --> 08:59.695
And how you can just
walk into one of our bars

08:59.957 --> 09:02.949
and play in our sandbox.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.450
Okay...

09:04.712 --> 09:05.997
Is there going
to be trouble here?

09:06.255 --> 09:08.792
Something tells me we're
not in for a group hug.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.587
We're gonna
need a distraction.

09:13.846 --> 09:14.801
'Kay.

09:15.556 --> 09:16.591
[Whack!]

09:16.849 --> 09:18.009
That'll do!

09:20.227 --> 09:21.512
Go, go, go!

09:30.195 --> 09:30.695
Thanks.

09:30.946 --> 09:31.856
Balzac.

09:32.114 --> 09:33.149
Well, thanks, Balzac,
I owe you one.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.362
Excellent.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.366
No!

09:35.617 --> 09:36.743
--Crap!
--What?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.404
You said you owe me one,
then you shook on it--

09:38.662 --> 09:40.744
softest hands,
do you moisturize?

09:40.998 --> 09:41.862
But that favour?

09:42.124 --> 09:43.955
I'm really gonna have
to call that in now.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.586
You must help me find
that which I truly seek.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.168
Once again--
What?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.958
You made a deal
with a Spriggan.

09:50.215 --> 09:50.965
And it's binding.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.593
What the hell's
a Spriggan?

09:56.597 --> 09:58.053
So I shook the hand
of a Dark Pixie,

09:58.307 --> 09:59.797
and now I owe
you my IOU?

10:00.058 --> 10:01.434
Yeah, uh-huh, exactly..

10:01.685 --> 10:03.550
I'm not much of a
"rules" kind of girl.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.222
You couldn't walk
away if you wanted to.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.266
Watch me.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.639
This is me,
walking away--

10:08.901 --> 10:10.266
[Laughing]

10:10.527 --> 10:11.482
Ah--
Ha ha.

10:12.905 --> 10:14.941
[Laughing]
They all try that one!

10:15.199 --> 10:16.279
They all try,
it never works though--

10:16.533 --> 10:17.864
But I love
your chutzpah.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.450
But that favour?
Saving cookie?

10:20.704 --> 10:22.695
I really need it.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.287
But then you're free!

10:24.541 --> 10:25.621
Of course you,
my dear, have made no

10:25.876 --> 10:27.457
binding agreement
so you may leave.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.918
What, and miss
all the fun?

10:30.172 --> 10:32.709
--Nuh-uh.
--So what's this favour?

10:38.847 --> 10:41.839
Whichever I choose...
Bo will be affected?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.226
Yes.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.977
But each could either
help her or hinder her.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.267
I can't do this.

10:49.525 --> 10:52.107
Bo is a descendant
of your blood.

10:52.361 --> 10:53.316
Whatever she
would choose,

10:53.570 --> 10:55.276
will be a choice
derived from you.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.147
Therefore you already
know the answer.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.777
There's isn't much time.
You must choose.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.667
[Cranks turning]

11:10.921 --> 11:12.536
Now we wait.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.749
How many sub-basements
does this place have?

11:18.011 --> 11:21.219
Well, Fang's secret lair
is very... well, secret.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.680
Wait a minute-- Fang?
The Tong Boss?

11:23.934 --> 11:25.549
That guy's seriously
bad news, dude.

11:25.811 --> 11:27.267
Yes, but with Bo's
Succubus charm,

11:27.521 --> 11:28.806
he'll be putty
in our hands.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.270
And you're sure this
Cookie we're rescuing

11:30.524 --> 11:31.229
from him is here?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.269
Oh yes,
she's very small--

11:33.527 --> 11:33.982
[Knocking]

11:34.236 --> 11:35.396
Ah-ha...

11:35.654 --> 11:37.485
All right.
Let's do this.

11:38.574 --> 11:40.735
Great. Bricks.

11:40.993 --> 11:44.235
That means
the secret hideout must be...

11:44.496 --> 11:45.656
Here!

11:47.916 --> 11:49.656
Only it's not.

11:49.918 --> 11:50.668
What do we do now?

11:50.919 --> 11:52.079
Bo, you wanna
step in here?

11:52.337 --> 11:54.123
|f Fang's hide-out
is so secret,

11:54.381 --> 11:56.246
how did we
find it so easily?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.839
There's got
to be a catch.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.629
No, I don't think so, dear.
I really don't thinnk so.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.503
I think we took a wrong-turn
at the pistons?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.390
Ah-ha.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.596
Excellent!

12:09.855 --> 12:10.605
[Sigh]

12:10.856 --> 12:12.642
Bo has succeeded.

12:13.942 --> 12:14.806
And if she'd failed?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.569
It would have
turned black.

12:16.820 --> 12:18.230
And Bo?

12:19.489 --> 12:22.652
The result would
not have been good.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.079
The feared Tong Boss is
a teenaged hipster?

12:33.337 --> 12:34.292
Do not be fooled
by his appearance.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.538
Fang is as dangerous
as his name suggests.

12:39.676 --> 12:40.882
Oh.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.588
It's one of those
kinds of games.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.965
And what kind of
game would that be?

12:48.226 --> 12:51.013
The kind that
needs to be fed.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.812
And again,
you must choose.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.072
[Liquid pouring]

13:01.323 --> 13:02.608
Yewberries?

13:03.325 --> 13:05.281
Oh, dear...

13:10.165 --> 13:11.280
So!

13:12.542 --> 13:14.282
You find your way in.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.877
Very admirable.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.706
You sit.

13:22.511 --> 13:27.096
You very pretty girls.
Mr. Fang likes you a lot.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.839
You...

13:29.101 --> 13:30.841
Come work for Mr. Fang.

13:31.103 --> 13:32.434
No, thanks,
Mr. Fang.

13:32.688 --> 13:33.894
[Whispering]
Not my type.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.523
Please, don't
agitate him...

13:35.774 --> 13:38.015
So what's your
type anyway, blondie?

13:38.276 --> 13:41.643
Well... it's nothing
you'd see in a mirror.

13:42.656 --> 13:43.862
Poser.

13:49.538 --> 13:50.744
What you
gwai Io want?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.329
Oh, great, now
she's done it.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.197
She's agitated him.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.867
Mr. Fang...

13:57.504 --> 14:00.291
You are
so beautiful...

14:03.093 --> 14:04.708
Yewberries
are poisonous!

14:04.970 --> 14:06.585
They affect each kind
of Fae differently!

14:06.847 --> 14:08.053
Yes.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.046
Some, they
render senseless.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.471
Some are inflicted
with temporary paralysis.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.890
I refuse to do this.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.520
You have no choice.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.244
Mr. Fang...

14:33.498 --> 14:37.366
you're going to tell me
where Cookie is, okay?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.249
You're going
to give me Cookie

14:45.510 --> 14:47.466
and you're going
to be cool-- [Mumbling]

14:49.890 --> 14:51.471
[Mumbling]
Mither Thang, gi a cu-ee.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.633
What the hell's
wrong with you?

14:54.895 --> 14:55.634
[Mumbling] | hab na idea.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.261
Oh no--
Oh dear, oh dear!

14:57.522 --> 14:58.272
Oh dear,
oh dear!

14:58.523 --> 15:00.354
You in big trouble, lady.

15:01.276 --> 15:02.061
--Cu-ee o'er de.
--What?

15:02.319 --> 15:03.274
O'er de!

15:03.528 --> 15:04.643
Stop talking!

15:08.283 --> 15:09.523
Wrong move, honey.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.867
You think you can mess
with the great Fang?

15:20.128 --> 15:22.335
Oh my--
Is he dead?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.754
We must get Cookie!

15:29.012 --> 15:29.592
Pick one.

15:29.846 --> 15:30.255
Which one?

15:30.514 --> 15:31.253
Your choice, Bo.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.595
Which one?

15:32.849 --> 15:33.599
[Whoosh!]

15:33.850 --> 15:36.592
Um, does anyone else
realize we're being shot at?

15:37.646 --> 15:39.477
What's with the--
old-timey blow darts?

15:39.731 --> 15:41.687
That, that's just Whitman.
He's trying to kill me.

15:41.942 --> 15:43.523
BO: Who's Whitman?!

15:46.947 --> 15:48.687
Wow!
That was close, huh?

15:48.949 --> 15:50.064
[With lisp] What the hell
is happening to me?

15:50.325 --> 15:51.940
Hm?
Sorry, dear?

15:52.202 --> 15:53.066
What happened
to me in there?!

15:53.328 --> 15:55.068
Look at you!
You got your tongue back.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.786
Yay! That's
a very good question.

15:57.040 --> 15:57.620
l have no idea.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.739
Why is this Whitman guy
trying to kill you?

16:00.001 --> 16:02.083
He has something I want.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.702
But he's the
one chasing you.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.621
Which, technically,
isn't my problem anymore.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.044
Here's your "cookie" --
that which you truly seek.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.838
Done deal
and deal done.

16:11.096 --> 16:13.087
Oooh, except
this isn't it.

16:13.348 --> 16:14.679
That which
I truly seek.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.264
No, this will merely
grant us passage.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.268
Passage to where?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.259
Oh, here
and there...

16:19.521 --> 16:20.601
Come!
We must hurry!

16:20.856 --> 16:23.063
We have to get the
prescription from the Landlady.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.271
Forty minutes tops!

16:24.526 --> 16:28.394
[Phone ringing]

16:28.655 --> 16:29.280
Hey! Lauren!

16:29.531 --> 16:30.281
Mmm--

16:30.532 --> 16:32.739
Why do chemists
like nitrates?

16:32.993 --> 16:35.530
Oh honey, I'm so not
the person to ask.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.279
No, no!
Why do chemists like nitrates?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.031
Oh, it's a joke!
Oh, yeah-- Uh, why?

16:41.293 --> 16:44.831
Because they're
cheaper than day rates.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.592
And pause for laughter.
Okay, listen--

16:49.843 --> 16:52.175
I am so glad that
you are coming tonight.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.215
I'd be a mess
if you weren't there.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.258
By the way, can I
borrow your bracelet?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.972
The one, um--
You know the one.

16:58.226 --> 16:59.727
Look, hon, I'm
gonna be a little late.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.184
Like, forty minutes.

17:01.438 --> 17:02.518
Forty?!

17:02.772 --> 17:04.763
Forty-five, fifty.
An hour tops!

17:05.025 --> 17:05.810
Who is that?

17:06.067 --> 17:07.398
--What?
--Where are you?

17:07.652 --> 17:11.895
Oh, no, I'm at The Dal.
Emergency training session.

17:12.157 --> 17:12.771
We'll miss the cocktails,

17:13.033 --> 17:14.273
but we'll make it
in time for the banquet.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.070
Okay? I promise.

17:28.673 --> 17:29.924
How long have we
been walking for now?

17:30.175 --> 17:31.335
Oh, an hour or so.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.335
You said this entire thing
would take "an hour or so."

17:34.596 --> 17:36.928
But it's just one more stop
and then we're done, right?

17:37.182 --> 17:38.718
Oh, yes.
Absolutely!

17:38.975 --> 17:40.351
We must find the Landlady
then use the cookie

17:40.602 --> 17:41.637
to gain entrance
to Brazenwood--

17:41.895 --> 17:43.851
An hour, hour
and a half, tops!

17:44.189 --> 17:46.054
Did you just say
"Brazenwood."

17:46.316 --> 17:47.726
What's Brazenwood?

17:47.984 --> 17:50.441
Uh, only a Dark
and lawless territory

17:50.695 --> 17:51.684
where the fringe
of society, lost souls

17:51.947 --> 17:54.814
and the criminally inclined
go to live and die.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.861
Exaggerations!
It's in the country.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.825
Lovely people. Quiet.
Keep to themselves.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.664
It is a hell-hole and I am not
going past the front gate.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.748
So--
Shall we?

18:06.002 --> 18:07.117
No!

18:07.545 --> 18:09.627
You lie about the
time this will take,

18:09.881 --> 18:11.291
you lie about
what we're after--

18:11.549 --> 18:13.130
Now you want us to go
to a Dark, lawless town

18:13.385 --> 18:14.215
in the middle
of nowhere?

18:14.469 --> 18:15.834
Where you'll
probably end up dead.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.085
l have to get to my girlfriend.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.883
It's a very
important day for her

18:19.140 --> 18:20.220
and she's
very important to me.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.557
Except that you lie
to her constantly.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.928
Not the healthiest relationships
from what I can see--

18:26.189 --> 18:27.929
Please, we don't
have time for this.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.601
I don't care!
I'm leaving!

18:29.859 --> 18:30.439
No, no, no, no!
You can't!

18:30.694 --> 18:32.559
We must
save Hannah!

18:33.196 --> 18:34.276
Talk.

18:34.531 --> 18:35.987
Fast.

18:36.241 --> 18:36.570
I'm a bounty hunter

18:36.825 --> 18:38.486
for the Demetrius Institute
for Higher Learning.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.654
It is a school that
specializes in giving rare

18:40.912 --> 18:44.871
and outcast Dark Fae
a home and education.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.410
Hannah is being
exploited by Whitman.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.501
And I must save her,
so please--

18:49.754 --> 18:51.494
I need your help.

18:54.509 --> 18:56.875
You better be
telling the truth.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.103
Muzzle it, bitches!

19:12.610 --> 19:13.986
You're trespassing.

19:14.237 --> 19:15.192
My dearest Landlady,

19:15.447 --> 19:17.938
we are here
for the prescription.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.076
You.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.918
lnfinity or a pit
of snakes?

19:32.172 --> 19:34.003
Great.
Good choices.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.042
Hurry Trick--

19:35.300 --> 19:37.461
I know, I know.
I have only minutes.

19:37.719 --> 19:38.629
Seconds!

19:39.804 --> 19:41.920
The sands of the hourglass
appear to be speeding up.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.966
Two cards...

19:46.227 --> 19:47.967
choose one.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.184
I hate this.

19:49.439 --> 19:50.645
We're on a bit
of a schedule.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.106
Choosing
supremely sucks.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.191
Come on, hot pants.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.364
You must make
a choice, Trick.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.700
Hesitating could kill her.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.035
Listen to
your instincts.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.699
Focus.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.282
Do it!

20:30.188 --> 20:30.893
[Whispering]
Shit...

20:31.147 --> 20:32.683
No one ever picks--

20:33.358 --> 20:34.643
--him.

20:34.901 --> 20:35.731
[Laughing]

20:35.985 --> 20:37.771
They're just cards.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.828
Who are you?

20:53.086 --> 20:55.042
We didn't come
here to play games.

20:55.380 --> 20:58.747
[Cranks turning]

21:02.345 --> 21:04.085
Again?

21:04.347 --> 21:06.133
You must pick one.

21:06.391 --> 21:08.427
The last time
I chose poison.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.470
Yes.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.683
That was surprising.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.025
Bo's favourite drink.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.689
No.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.404
Her least favourite.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.113
One Elderberry cocktail

21:28.371 --> 21:31.909
with nectar
of gnome coming up.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.202
I don't like you.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.792
You're trouble
and my babies smell it.

21:36.045 --> 21:36.830
Now, get out!

21:37.088 --> 21:39.579
Not until we get
our prescription.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.547
You got payment?

21:50.894 --> 21:52.555
These are some
mighty powerful tears.

21:52.812 --> 21:55.474
Hannah is
a mighty powerful girl.

22:04.449 --> 22:05.404
Now get her out of here.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.273
[Dog barking, yelping]

22:07.535 --> 22:09.196
Petunia?!

get out of here!

22:17.462 --> 22:18.622
Or maybe we
gotta get into here.

Come on!

22:19.964 --> 22:21.750
It's okay,
it's okay.

22:22.717 --> 22:23.046

22:23.301 --> 22:24.632
I'm over here
in the open!

22:42.028 --> 22:42.892
We don't have much time.

22:43.154 --> 22:45.531
You must get
to Brazenwood.

the cookie to gain entrance--

leaving you here.

No-- No, no, no...
I'll just slow you down.

to get Hannah.

riddled with land mines.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.682
If we go in without
actually using that cookie?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.218

think of all people,

should go alone.

You can stop crying now.

30:03.719 --> 30:06.051
No. I. Can't.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.258
It's what Squonks do.

to be this age.

leave this place.

But, Mr. Whitman tells me
things about the world.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.582
And it sounds awful.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.377
I think he's telling you those
things to make you cry more.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.465
To collect more tears.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.257
At least my tears
make people happy.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.470
But you can
be happy too.

No, I'm-- I'm
just a weirdo-- [Sniff]

31:05.781 --> 31:07.032
We have
to get out of here.

won't come willingly--

No!

31:10.244 --> 31:10.994

31:12.079 --> 31:13.034
If you move
a Squonk involuntarily,

they will dissolve
into tears. Literally.

happy that you're here.

trying to con me.

Look, I am not
conning you.

There is a nice man who
has been looking for you.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.067
He wants to take
you to a school

31:49.325 --> 31:51.441
where you can be
with others like yourself.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.363
Other Squonks?

31:53.788 --> 31:56.450
Other kids who are just
as exceptional as you.

31:57.124 --> 32:00.036
Can we maybe have
this little love-fest later?

32:00.294 --> 32:03.411
Will there be boys?

have time for that--

Tell me again.

33:44.899 --> 33:47.686
You're smart,
you're fast...

33:47.943 --> 33:50.559
...and you're a helluva
lot cuter than him.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.946
Right...

34:06.712 --> 34:07.667
Don't I get a gun?

34:07.922 --> 34:08.911
He's got a gun!

34:09.173 --> 34:11.505
Don't matter if he's
heeled or not, honey.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.045
You draw
with what you got.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.259
Oh shit...

34:21.936 --> 34:23.016
[Gasp!]

34:24.480 --> 34:26.266
Oh, double shit...

34:27.274 --> 34:28.810
The Dark don't
play fair, do they?

34:29.068 --> 34:30.433
It's not a Dark thing.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.025
This has to stop--

34:33.781 --> 34:35.487
No interference.

34:36.075 --> 34:37.736
What the hell do I do?

34:40.162 --> 34:41.402
Okay, Trick...

34:41.664 --> 34:43.245
YOU have to concentrate.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.785
Empty your mind
of all thought.

34:46.043 --> 34:47.829
Clear your head.

34:48.087 --> 34:50.920
Focus.
Trust your instincts.

34:51.173 --> 34:51.753
Listen to your gut--

34:52.007 --> 34:53.543
Stella--

34:54.093 --> 34:57.005
I mean this
with all due respect--

34:57.471 --> 34:59.678
But shut the hell up.

35:26.917 --> 35:30.159
Time to put that
cricket down for good.

35:32.840 --> 35:33.795
[Whoosh!]

35:40.306 --> 35:42.092
Shit...

35:51.859 --> 35:53.815
[Laughing]

36:00.701 --> 36:03.443
You have...
quite an effect on me.

36:03.704 --> 36:05.660
What if I did this?

36:10.336 --> 36:12.918
[Energy pulsing]

36:13.505 --> 36:15.041
[Laughing]
I did it!

36:19.720 --> 36:21.426
I declare a winner!

36:21.680 --> 36:22.840
You may take
your claim!

36:23.098 --> 36:26.056
[Laughing]

36:26.310 --> 36:27.425
Are we gonna pass
the gatekeeper?

36:27.686 --> 36:30.268
I really like him!
He's so fun!

36:31.065 --> 36:32.680
You know,
you really are a weirdo.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.852
Sweet!

36:35.110 --> 36:36.190
But a weirdo.

36:36.445 --> 36:37.651
Thanks.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.606
[Giggling]

36:48.832 --> 36:50.572
[Knocking on door]

36:59.718 --> 37:01.674
Well, it's about
damn time!

37:04.306 --> 37:05.887
That we met?

37:07.142 --> 37:08.598
Well, damnit, I agree!

37:08.852 --> 37:10.353
Uh, Dr. Taft?

37:10.604 --> 37:11.229
Please.
Isaac.

37:11.480 --> 37:12.515
Wow.

37:12.773 --> 37:13.432
Come in, come in!

37:13.690 --> 37:15.897
I'm a huge fan
of your work

37:16.151 --> 37:17.812
on tissue-engineered
vascular grafts, |--

37:18.070 --> 37:19.480
Oh, no, it's the other way
around, Dr. Lewis.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.444
You're the reason
I went to tonight's

37:21.698 --> 37:23.950
Science and
Technology Snorefest.

37:24.201 --> 37:24.860
Oh.

37:25.119 --> 37:26.029
Was it was that bad?

37:26.286 --> 37:29.323
Oh, my God...
The geekage was stifling.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.661
But--

37:30.916 --> 37:32.656
I snagged you this.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.163
Oh, wow.

37:39.425 --> 37:40.255
That's my name.

37:40.509 --> 37:41.669
Yup.

37:43.178 --> 37:43.633
Thank you.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.388
Listen, I don't wanna
impose but I was wondering

37:45.639 --> 37:47.425
if I could take you for
a drink or something?

37:47.683 --> 37:48.843
I just wanna get in
that head of yours?

37:49.101 --> 37:49.965
[Laughing]
Yeah--

37:50.227 --> 37:51.808
You want to get
inside my head?

37:52.062 --> 37:55.099
Yeah, your papers,
they blow me away.

37:55.357 --> 37:56.142
You read my papers?

37:56.400 --> 37:57.810
I've read
all your papers.

37:58.068 --> 38:01.777
You make morphogenesis
and RNA splicing seem exciting.

38:02.489 --> 38:03.945
Don't know how,
but you do.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.530
So what do you say?
Huh?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.944
Take you out,
I got this bar

38:07.202 --> 38:09.113
with this mixologist
that kills it.

38:10.497 --> 38:11.577
Okay!

38:12.666 --> 38:14.998
I'd hate to let
my dress go to waste.

38:15.252 --> 38:16.458
Exactly.

38:16.712 --> 38:17.121
Just give me a sec--

38:17.379 --> 38:18.585
Sure.

38:21.717 --> 38:22.376
Hey, Isaac?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.090
Yeah?

38:24.344 --> 38:26.335
Why do chemists
like nitrates?

38:26.930 --> 38:28.591
Why?

38:28.849 --> 38:30.589
Because they're
cheaper than day rates.

38:30.851 --> 38:32.057
[Chuckling]

38:32.311 --> 38:34.267
That's funny...

38:34.688 --> 38:36.303
I can't find
Bo anywhere.

38:36.857 --> 38:39.974
And this game's been
too quiet too long.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.476
Patience.

38:43.447 --> 38:43.902
ls Bo here?

38:44.156 --> 38:45.566
I woke from the effects
of the dart--

38:45.824 --> 38:47.906
I couldn't get another cookie
to get into Brazenwood.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.024
Whitman--
He was gone.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.651
I think he's gonna
try and kill Bo--

38:50.913 --> 38:51.777
And it's my fault.

38:52.039 --> 38:53.745
Bo's in Brazenwood?

38:56.877 --> 38:58.617
What does that mean?

38:58.879 --> 39:00.619
Something
about happiness.

39:00.881 --> 39:03.668
And yet... unhappiness.

39:03.926 --> 39:05.041
Gee, ya think?

39:05.302 --> 39:06.633
You guys
would not believe

39:06.887 --> 39:08.752
the craziness that
I have just been through--

39:09.014 --> 39:10.174
Hi!

39:10.432 --> 39:12.673
You're just in time.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.601
In time for what?

39:27.866 --> 39:29.402
Hannah's tears
are a source

39:29.660 --> 39:32.527
of both happiness
and unhappiness.

39:32.788 --> 39:35.029
[Cranks turning]

39:35.290 --> 39:36.791
And I believe...

39:37.042 --> 39:38.623
we've reached the
end of the game.

39:38.877 --> 39:40.538
So, what
happens next?

39:41.088 --> 39:43.625
Something most
likely unexpected.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.457
[Cranks turning]

39:46.718 --> 39:53.055
[Circus music playing]

39:53.308 --> 39:54.684
Well--
That's it?

39:55.894 --> 39:57.430
That was beautiful.

39:58.647 --> 39:59.762
Balzac: Ahem!

40:00.274 --> 40:02.105
Isabeau, on this day
in this place,

40:02.359 --> 40:05.692
you are hereby officially
invited to The Dawning.

40:06.488 --> 40:08.649
May your destiny be
of your own choosing.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.655
[Sniffling]

40:12.077 --> 40:15.114
Bo: So Balzac was my
invitation all along.

40:15.372 --> 40:17.283
And you passed.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.448
Congratulations.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.287
Thank you.

40:26.133 --> 40:28.044
Thank you so much--
Oh, my God!

40:28.302 --> 40:28.836
Lauren--

40:29.094 --> 40:30.254
Oh, my God--

40:31.096 --> 40:32.461
Shit!

40:50.240 --> 40:51.901
Lauren!

40:53.619 --> 40:54.825
Lauren!

40:56.079 --> 40:58.786
Guess she went
to the banquet without you.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.460
And the award
for Worst Girlfriend Ever!

41:04.212 --> 41:05.622
Goes to me...

41:06.673 --> 41:08.288
She'll forgive you.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.010
Here's to your Dawning.

41:14.264 --> 41:15.549
May you not die.

41:18.352 --> 41:19.011
I won't.

41:19.269 --> 41:20.475
You sure about that?

41:21.855 --> 41:24.016
No.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.889
Well, if I was
a gambling woman

41:26.151 --> 41:27.436
my money
would be on you.

41:27.694 --> 41:29.025
Cheers.

41:30.781 --> 41:31.736
[Clink]

41:43.877 --> 41:45.287
Let me ask
you something.

41:46.088 --> 41:48.750
You weren't the one that
made the deal with Balzac.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.831
You could have
left at any time.

41:51.301 --> 41:52.416
Truth.

41:52.678 --> 41:54.543
So why didn't you?

41:55.681 --> 41:57.342
You think I'd ever
hear the end of it

41:57.599 --> 41:58.805
if one little hair
on everyone's

41:59.059 --> 42:01.391
favourite Succulette's
head was harmed?

42:01.645 --> 42:02.976
Nope.

42:03.230 --> 42:06.017
So I decided to stick
around, like-y or not.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.935
Like-y.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.240
I was wrong
about you.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.078
You're one
of the good ones.

42:24.084 --> 42:25.415
Well.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.037
You really do suck
at reading people.

42:30.298 --> 42:33.540
So, I...
better get going.

43:04.332 --> 43:05.993
No.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.333
No!

43:08.587 --> 43:10.168
Please tell me
she's not the one.
