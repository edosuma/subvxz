02:46.775 --> 02:48.993
Two large Bushmills please, darling.

03:40.537 --> 03:42.289
Lads want another drink?

03:46.043 --> 03:47.795
What about you?

04:56.363 --> 04:59.016
Leave it out, will you?

04:59.116 --> 05:01.618
- Get in.
- All right, all right.

05:03.995 --> 05:06.168
Inside.

07:17.796 --> 07:19.573
Harold will be well pleased.

07:19.673 --> 07:22.392
- When is he back?
- Today.

07:23.301 --> 07:25.036
Highly confidential.

07:25.136 --> 07:28.560
I need them tomorrow,
for a council meeting.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.835
No sweat. I'll get them photocopied.

07:31.935 --> 07:34.312
And the Americans?

07:34.938 --> 07:37.591
- I reckon they're coming.
- Good.

07:37.691 --> 07:42.037
- About the nosh: on the corporation?
- Of course, councillor.

07:43.238 --> 07:45.911
- See you, Jeff.
- See you.

08:29.951 --> 08:31.828
Wait a minute!

09:24.464 --> 09:27.868
Here's the plans, he needs them
back by this afternoon.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.936
Good old George.

09:30.679 --> 09:33.665
- Everything all right while I was away?
- Yeah.

09:33.765 --> 09:36.084
The new casino has gone through.

09:36.184 --> 09:39.813
- No problems?
- No, everything's all right.

09:40.772 --> 09:43.008
Did anyone guess where I was?

09:43.108 --> 09:46.612
Alan reckoned a health farm.

09:46.945 --> 09:49.681
One or two rumours about New York.

09:49.781 --> 09:52.659
- But nobody guessed?
- No.

10:27.485 --> 10:31.410
Should have left 10 minutes ago,
I'm late for church.

10:32.323 --> 10:34.871
I hate being late for church.

10:36.161 --> 10:37.833
There you are.

10:38.663 --> 10:41.712
Bye bye, have a nice Easter.

10:43.835 --> 10:46.713
God rot your soul.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.904
Oh, Christ, Harold, she's always worse
when she's going to church.

11:11.905 --> 11:15.016
Mother's got really religious in her
old age, ain't she'?

11:15.116 --> 11:17.644
Church three times a day.
It's Good Friday.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.479
Have a Bloody Mary.

11:19.579 --> 11:23.108
She thinks Paula is an angel
and I'm the devil in disguise.

11:23.208 --> 11:26.444
Ah well, me and Paula have only
been divorced ten years, love.

11:26.544 --> 11:28.613
Give her a chance to get used to it.

11:28.713 --> 11:30.407
Cheers.

11:30.507 --> 11:34.307
- Have you organised everything?
- Yes, it's coming along.

11:35.804 --> 11:38.523
Charlie should be landing about now.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.567
Here.

11:42.143 --> 11:44.212
Maybe we should have gone
to the airport to meet him.

11:44.312 --> 11:46.589
Nah, play it cool.

11:46.689 --> 11:48.967
When the governor of Coca-Cola
drops in to London,

11:49.067 --> 11:51.535
the Queen don't go dashing
off to Heathrow, does she?

11:52.070 --> 11:54.597
- Queen?
- Well, you know what I mean.

11:54.697 --> 11:56.349
All playing it up, right?

11:56.449 --> 11:59.436
You went to school with Princess Anne,
played hockey with her, all that.

11:59.536 --> 12:02.105
It's lacrosse at Benenden.
Hockey's frightfully vulgar.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.357
Yes, yes, plenty of that, yeah.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.401
The Yanks love snobbery.

12:06.501 --> 12:08.528
They really feel they've
arrived in England

12:08.628 --> 12:10.739
if the upper classes
treat them like shit.

12:10.839 --> 12:14.092
Gives them a sense of history.

12:14.634 --> 12:17.245
We'd better check
how the chef's progressing.

12:17.345 --> 12:20.098
Ere, that geezer
don't half know about grub.

12:20.390 --> 12:22.667
The smells that have been coming up
from the galley all morning

12:22.767 --> 12:24.711
have been driving me potty.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.654
You lay off the vodka.

12:27.272 --> 12:29.774
Oi!

12:31.609 --> 12:34.137
- Ça va?
- Ah, Madame, regardez-moi ça.

12:34.237 --> 12:37.223
J'ai grands assiettes bleues
avec ces frises.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.791
C'est ridicule!
Je veux des assiettes blanches

12:44.664 --> 12:47.108
That's a right horrible ponce.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.611
Well, he's French, ain't he?

12:49.711 --> 12:52.259
C'est vraiment merveilleux.

12:52.380 --> 12:55.349
- Nous remercions beaucoup.
- Merci.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.535
Very nice.

12:57.635 --> 13:00.288
These French geezers
really know their stuff, eh?

13:00.388 --> 13:04.233
- That new?
- Bought 'em yesterday, 20 quid apiece.

13:04.809 --> 13:07.587
I bet Harold was reluctant
to take the labels off, eh?

13:07.687 --> 13:11.157
He broke two of them demonstrating
their exquisite delicacy.

13:11.983 --> 13:14.201
He doesn't know his own strength.

13:17.572 --> 13:20.225
Have you sorted out Immigration
for the Yank?

13:20.325 --> 13:22.102
Yeah, Parky's dealt with that.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.670
Then you may go and
have a drink on deck.

15:24.741 --> 15:26.309
Hello mate, are you all right?

15:26.409 --> 15:28.311
Having a good time?

15:28.411 --> 15:30.413
Enjoy yourselves.

15:31.289 --> 15:32.815
Councillors.

15:32.915 --> 15:34.712
Excuse me a moment.
I won't keep him long.

15:35.793 --> 15:39.342
Those plans came in very handy,
my son, much obliged.

15:39.547 --> 15:40.907
No sweat, Harold.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.493
The license on the casino,
that go through alright, no problems?

15:43.593 --> 15:45.536
- A slight one.
- What's that?

15:45.636 --> 15:47.622
Councillor Taylor seemed to think
you're a gangster.

15:47.722 --> 15:49.123
Leave off!

15:49.223 --> 15:50.500
What's the SP on the American?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.102
Just pump him full of information,
everything you've got.

15:53.269 --> 15:55.421
Instant planning permission,
all that sort of chat?

15:55.521 --> 15:57.048
- Yeah, plenty of, er...
- Fine.

15:57.148 --> 15:59.717
The Yanks think we're a crock-handed
corner shop over here, know what I mean?

15:59.817 --> 16:01.803
Exude efficiency, right?

16:01.903 --> 16:04.347
I'll tell him how quickly my
little enterprises are springing up.

16:04.447 --> 16:06.915
- That should appeal, OK?
- Yeah, terrific, terrific.

16:07.950 --> 16:10.728
Parky, you're not drinking?

16:10.828 --> 16:13.231
Harold, you know I only drink
when I'm on duty.

16:13.331 --> 16:15.608
- How's business, alright?
- A drizzle of complaints.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.710
You get a lot of that in your game, eh?

16:18.336 --> 16:19.904
- Hello, Dave.
- Hello, Mr Shand.

16:20.004 --> 16:22.156
How are you?
Last time I saw you, you had spots.

16:22.256 --> 16:23.908
Thanks very much!

16:24.008 --> 16:25.994
Even I notice the coppers
are getting younger now.

16:26.094 --> 16:29.247
- He's a detective sergeant now, Harold.
- Is he?

16:29.347 --> 16:31.440
Celebration! Oi, come here.

16:31.557 --> 16:33.543
- Champagne, my son.
- Thanks very much.

16:33.643 --> 16:37.817
- Here's to you.
- Nice to see real friends doing well.

16:38.356 --> 16:39.966
- Here's to real friends.
- Real friends!

16:40.066 --> 16:42.113
Alright, George?

16:43.694 --> 16:44.762
Jeff.

16:44.862 --> 16:46.363
Won't be a minute, alright?

16:48.991 --> 16:51.436
Keep your eyes on
the boys' behaviour, will you?

16:51.536 --> 16:53.771
I don't want any of 'em
acting like delinquents.

16:53.871 --> 16:56.357
No chance, they know it's important.

16:56.457 --> 16:59.005
I told 'em to put
their wedding suits on.

17:00.128 --> 17:01.946
I think you're gonna like Charlie.

17:02.046 --> 17:03.656
So what's the plan?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.282
A cocktail here
so we can clog the marina,

17:05.383 --> 17:09.579
then off down the river so they can see
the scope of the whole project.

17:09.679 --> 17:11.164
Terrific. Have you fixed the moorings?

17:11.263 --> 17:12.915
Yeah, it's all under control.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.061
Another thing...

17:15.351 --> 17:18.046
Harris has got a lot of talking to do
this afternoon...

17:18.146 --> 17:19.672
can you keep him off the booze?

17:19.771 --> 17:22.273
Top him up with
Perrier water or something.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.844
Harold, he's here.

17:24.944 --> 17:27.538
You two pipe him aboard
and I'll be up, all right?

17:34.843 --> 17:37.047
I can't believe you're here!

17:39.834 --> 17:43.804
- The kid from New Jersey, eh?
- The boy from Stepney.

17:44.046 --> 17:46.514
Charlie, have some champagne.

17:46.883 --> 17:50.411
You should be the captain of this boat!
Great timing!

17:50.511 --> 17:52.705
Listen I wanna propose a toast.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.958
- Hands across the ocean, right?
- To the future.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.544
To the future here, yeah?

17:58.644 --> 18:02.423
Harold, I don't think you met Tony,
did you, when you were over there'?

18:02.523 --> 18:04.759
- Tony who?
- Tony, my lawyer.

18:04.859 --> 18:08.579
- Mr. Shand, Tony.
- Very nice to meet you.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.183
Charlie, Tony, would you like
to come and meet some people now?

18:12.283 --> 18:13.750
- Would that be OK?
- Good.

18:14.243 --> 18:16.495
They're important, but they're nice.
Come on.

18:19.373 --> 18:21.692
Keep your eye on that Tony.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.761
He never said
he was gonna bring anybody.

18:24.921 --> 18:27.532
They always come in twos.
Like the bailiffs.

18:27.632 --> 18:29.884
Means they mean business.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.322
Hi.

19:30.653 --> 19:32.496
Hi.

20:11.902 --> 20:15.473
"Happy are those
who are called to His supper.

20:15.573 --> 20:19.393
"Lord, I am not worthy to receive You,

20:19.493 --> 20:22.917
"but only say the word
and I shall be healed."

20:45.611 --> 20:46.982
Oh, my God!

20:47.813 --> 20:49.656
Ladies and gentlemen.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.288
I'm not a politician.

21:01.327 --> 21:05.690
I'm a businessman
with a sense of history.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.067
And I'm also a Londoner,

21:08.167 --> 21:15.141
and today is a day of great historical
significance for London.

21:16.425 --> 21:19.644
Our country is not an island anymore.

21:20.221 --> 21:24.500
We're a leading European state.

21:24.600 --> 21:29.046
And I believe that this is the decade,

21:29.146 --> 21:34.969
in which London
will become Europe's capital.

21:35.069 --> 21:38.514
Having cleared away the outdated,

21:38.614 --> 21:43.290
we've got mile after mile and
acre after acre of land,

21:43.494 --> 21:46.497
for our future prosperity.

21:47.498 --> 21:50.359
No other city in the world...

21:50.459 --> 21:55.089
has got right in its centre,
such an opportunity...

21:55.214 --> 21:58.159
for profitable progress.

21:58.259 --> 22:02.559
So it's important that
the right people...

22:03.931 --> 22:07.184
mastermind the new London.

22:08.060 --> 22:14.613
Proven people, with nerve,
knowledge and expertise.

22:16.610 --> 22:19.954
That, ladies and gentlemen,

22:21.115 --> 22:24.243
is why you are all here today.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.839
All trusted friends.

22:30.207 --> 22:35.588
And why Charlie and Tony are here today,
our American friends,

22:36.338 --> 22:41.264
to endorse the global nature
of this venture.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.938
Let's hear it, ladies and gentlemen.

22:46.182 --> 22:50.812
- Hands across the ocean!
- Hands across the ocean!

22:59.653 --> 23:02.640
There used to be 80 or 90 ships
in here at one time.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.334
They used to queue up to get in...

23:05.451 --> 23:09.205
all the way from Gallions Reach
right the way down to Tilbury.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.967
Used to be the greatest docks in
the world at one time, this.

23:14.293 --> 23:17.012
Things change, Harold.
Don't get nostalgic.

23:17.379 --> 23:19.031
Look to the future.

23:19.131 --> 23:22.054
You realise you're
35 minutes away from Europe?

23:22.343 --> 23:24.161
Great potential.

23:24.261 --> 23:26.080
I live in a new country,

23:26.180 --> 23:30.025
and I respect the past, but always
keep my eye on the future.

23:33.521 --> 23:35.898
Don't touch, I'll take care of that.

23:43.906 --> 23:46.684
You have a good sleep, Charlie,
we've got a tight schedule.

23:46.784 --> 23:49.437
I want you to meet my property lawyers.
The best!

23:49.537 --> 23:53.065
And then there's an accountant
who specialises in gambling tax.

23:53.165 --> 23:56.193
This isn't a horse race.
Don't rush me, Harold.

23:56.293 --> 23:58.362
Then there's someone
you have got to meet.

23:58.462 --> 24:02.808
Harold, I said don't rush me.
I hate tight schedules.

24:03.050 --> 24:07.271
I'll get everything covered that I
have to cover, but in my own time.

24:09.431 --> 24:12.480
We're just docking now. It will be
nice and quiet if you want to sleep.

24:13.519 --> 24:17.569
Come on, Harold.
Let's leave Charlie alone for a while.

24:28.242 --> 24:30.790
Bad luck putting the hat on the bed.

24:31.996 --> 24:35.566
Relax, he'll be alright.

24:35.666 --> 24:39.090
Yeah, poor old sod is tired.

25:09.867 --> 25:12.315
Look out for the boys in blue.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.677
Yeah?

25:26.258 --> 25:28.226
Yeah.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.185
What?

25:39.939 --> 25:41.907
Right.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.830
This...

25:53.994 --> 25:56.747
diabolical liberty.

25:58.540 --> 26:00.337
What is it?

26:01.085 --> 26:04.088
Blown up. He's dead.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.993
Eric is dead. Car bomb.

26:09.093 --> 26:11.161
Eh?

26:11.261 --> 26:13.330
Mother's all right,
suffering from shock.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.931
She's in the London Hospital.

26:15.557 --> 26:17.309
I don't understand.

26:17.893 --> 26:21.067
You need a million dollar computer
to understand this.

26:21.689 --> 26:25.926
Who'd do such a thing, it's outrageous.
Outside a church...

26:26.026 --> 26:29.513
you don't go crucifying people outside
a church on Good Friday.

26:29.613 --> 26:33.117
- What's the matter, Harold?
- Eric's been blown up.

26:34.034 --> 26:36.502
- A bomb?
- Yeah, in the Rolls.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.127
- I don't believe it. When?
- Just now.

26:40.290 --> 26:42.318
Mother's in hospital
suffering from shock.

26:42.418 --> 26:43.885
I'm not surprised.

26:44.086 --> 26:46.655
She went to church to say her prayers,
not to get blown up.

26:46.755 --> 26:47.990
But why?

26:48.090 --> 26:50.592
Someone trying to discredit you
in front of...

26:51.010 --> 26:53.308
What, the Yanks?

26:54.221 --> 26:57.291
No, nobody knew, did they?

26:57.391 --> 27:00.044
- Well, they mustn't find out.
- They're sleeping.

27:00.144 --> 27:05.257
Right, I want everybody in the
corporation working on this, fast!

27:05.357 --> 27:07.051
And I want Colin here.

27:07.151 --> 27:09.637
Where is he? He should have been here.
Where is he?

27:09.737 --> 27:11.805
- He went swimming.
- Swimming?

27:11.905 --> 27:13.432
He should have been here.

27:13.532 --> 27:16.352
Right, I want everybody working.
Jeff, you get on the blower.

27:16.452 --> 27:19.355
Razors, you round 'em all up
and you get 'em moving, fast.

27:19.455 --> 27:23.550
Right, keep them on their toes because
I want this settled, tonight.

27:25.627 --> 27:28.050
And you'd better see your mother.

27:29.798 --> 27:31.766
Yeah, yeah.

27:32.342 --> 27:35.788
Listen, if anyone hears anything,
anything at all,

27:35.888 --> 27:38.061
I'll be at the Mayfair casino, right?

27:41.602 --> 27:44.070
It's the work of a maniac.

27:48.192 --> 27:51.536
I'll have his carcass
dripping blood by midnight.

28:29.191 --> 28:31.159
More bad news.

28:31.902 --> 28:33.303
Colin.

28:33.403 --> 28:35.780
- Colin?
- Yeah.

28:36.156 --> 28:38.249
Dead.

29:40.596 --> 29:43.440
I did my national service with Colin.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.645
We did six months
in the glasshouse together.

29:47.895 --> 29:53.117
Two kids of 18, six months. They put us
right through it, the bastards.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.911
Salisbury Plain manoeuvres.

30:00.532 --> 30:04.332
Used to hump this bleedin'
great wireless about.

30:07.539 --> 30:12.069
One winter, snow, blizzards,

30:12.169 --> 30:14.467
freezing the bollocks off the ponies.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.673
I got lost.

30:16.924 --> 30:20.428
In them days you stayed lost,
until they nicked you for being AWOL.

30:21.970 --> 30:25.565
And Colin, on a 24 hour pass,

30:27.100 --> 30:29.819
he came out looking for me on his own.

30:30.604 --> 30:33.402
It's lucky he found me or I
would've froze to death.

30:34.650 --> 30:36.572
Yeah.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.288
Colin never hurt a fly...

30:41.782 --> 30:44.501
well, only when it was necessary.

30:44.910 --> 30:48.814
It was always clean, wasn't it?
Never anything malicious about Colin.

30:48.914 --> 30:51.733
- Why slice him up?
- On my grief.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.926
Sorry, H.

31:00.259 --> 31:02.853
Me and Colin was very close.

31:04.513 --> 31:07.357
I've known him since we was at school.

31:10.936 --> 31:12.904
What's going on?

31:16.066 --> 31:19.536
They try and blow up me mum,
wipe out me best mate...

31:20.487 --> 31:22.598
What are they trying to do?

31:22.698 --> 31:25.701
Put the frighteners on me,
wind me up, what?

31:34.042 --> 31:35.839
Harold,

31:36.169 --> 31:37.821
I've kept it all incognito,

31:37.921 --> 31:40.515
they're gonna collect the body
in an ice cream van.

31:40.966 --> 31:43.076
There's a lot of dignity in that,
isn't there?

31:43.176 --> 31:45.162
Going out like a raspberry ripple.

31:45.262 --> 31:48.982
They're gonna store the body in the
freezer down the abattoir.

31:49.224 --> 31:51.601
Alright, granddad.

31:53.103 --> 31:54.900
Thanks for the call.

31:56.398 --> 31:59.468
- Did anyone see anything?
- Not what happened,

31:59.568 --> 32:02.638
the pool attendant found him but
I told her it was a haemorrhage.

32:02.738 --> 32:05.224
- Good lad.
- Better close the bars, Harold.

32:05.324 --> 32:08.327
No, open up, let 'em enjoy the holiday.

32:09.411 --> 32:12.414
If you hear anything,
anything at all, you give me a bell.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.087
Come on.

32:39.191 --> 32:42.469
- Thank Christ you're here.
- Any news?

32:42.569 --> 32:44.680
Colin's murdered.

32:44.780 --> 32:46.932
- Colin's what?
- Dead.

32:47.032 --> 32:49.601
- Where?
- In the swimming pool.

32:49.701 --> 32:53.522
- Drowned?
- Don't be stupid, he did lifesaving.

32:53.622 --> 32:56.124
What does it all mean,
a bomb in here and...

32:56.458 --> 32:59.586
- A what?
- There was a bomb in the casino.

33:00.754 --> 33:02.551
You'd better show us.

33:09.805 --> 33:12.165
I wonder how it got disconnected?

33:12.265 --> 33:15.564
Well the wire must have come loose
when Lou opened it.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.734
Stroke of luck, though, wannit?

33:21.358 --> 33:23.326
Last night...

33:24.403 --> 33:27.076
Were there any peculiarities?

33:27.280 --> 33:30.434
Usual crowd, regular punters,
nothing really.

33:30.534 --> 33:32.436
What, no strangers?

33:32.536 --> 33:36.836
A few Arabs, it was a good night,
nothing unusual.

33:37.332 --> 33:39.584
Nothing unusual he says!?

33:39.960 --> 33:43.113
Eric's been blown to smithereens,
Colin's been carved up,

33:43.213 --> 33:45.324
and I've got a bomb in me casino,

33:45.424 --> 33:48.410
- and you say nothing unusual?
- Well, you know what I mean, Harold.

33:48.510 --> 33:52.080
Parky. Meeting King George V dock now.

33:52.180 --> 33:56.084
He's put out a story the bomb in the car
was a gas leak. Buy us some time.

33:56.184 --> 33:58.561
Nice one, come here.

34:00.981 --> 34:04.405
There was nothing unusual
when I was in New York, was there?

34:05.235 --> 34:06.720
No, nothing at all.

34:06.820 --> 34:09.914
- Nothing alien?
- No.

34:11.199 --> 34:14.393
How much did we pay
Parky last year? Twenty grand?

34:14.494 --> 34:16.521
- More.
- Right.

34:16.621 --> 34:19.418
Then he can start
earning his bloody money.

34:30.260 --> 34:32.637
Who's having a go at me?

34:35.891 --> 34:39.485
Can you think of anybody who might have
an old score to settle, or something?

34:42.105 --> 34:44.402
Who's big enough to take you on?

34:48.402 --> 34:50.780
Well there was a few.

34:50.947 --> 34:52.824
Like who?

34:56.536 --> 34:59.789
Nah, they're all dead.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.702
Let's walk.

35:32.072 --> 35:36.327
We can't have bombs going off, Harold.
We can't have corpses,

35:36.493 --> 35:39.813
I had to stick my neck right out to keep
this out of the forensic blokes' hands.

35:39.913 --> 35:41.189
Did you come up with anything?

35:41.289 --> 35:43.066
Nothing.
I thought you were gonna tell me.

35:43.166 --> 35:45.634
- What, no whispers?
- Not a thing.

35:49.965 --> 35:51.808
Look at this place.

35:53.218 --> 35:57.038
You know I once caught the pox
off some Indonesian bird here,

35:57.138 --> 35:59.265
I was just a bobby on the beat then.

36:00.559 --> 36:05.314
So this is where they're gonna build
the 1988 Olympic stadium?

36:07.065 --> 36:10.260
Can you imagine nig-nogs doing
the long jump along these quays?

36:10.360 --> 36:13.704
Stick a rocket up their arsehole,
they'll jump alright.

36:17.450 --> 36:19.686
I want action on this, Parky.

36:19.786 --> 36:22.288
The Yanks are clean,
we've checked them out.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.691
You got to go down to
a third division messenger

36:24.791 --> 36:27.214
to even come up with a sniff
of villainy with that lot.

36:28.753 --> 36:30.447
How about Tottenham?

36:30.547 --> 36:33.766
They can't even nick car batteries
without getting electrocuted.

36:35.969 --> 36:38.997
- Some of the Clancy mob are out.
- Nah.

36:39.097 --> 36:42.851
This is too accomplished for them.

36:43.268 --> 36:46.112
Besides, no one's had
their teeth pulled out.

36:47.188 --> 36:49.235
The spades?

36:49.399 --> 36:51.617
Would they overlap?

36:52.402 --> 36:55.180
I've never dealt in narcotics.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.225
How do I know?
I don't know what they're after, do I?

36:58.325 --> 37:00.668
I'll check it out.

37:00.994 --> 37:02.812
I'm sorry about Colin.

37:02.912 --> 37:06.024
I'll put him on
the missing persons list.

37:06.124 --> 37:08.401
That should hold it off for a while.

37:08.501 --> 37:11.800
Just as well, the commissioner
will be poking around.

37:12.005 --> 37:13.865
Well, stall him.

37:13.965 --> 37:17.264
We should have sorted this out
by this afternoon, I'm hoping.

37:18.762 --> 37:21.957
We're looking forward to this this deal
of yours, Harold, with the Yanks,

37:22.057 --> 37:24.855
the legitimisation of your corporation.

37:25.560 --> 37:28.939
But we don't like fuss. Calm exteriors.

37:29.564 --> 37:32.801
For ten years there's been no aggro
and it's all been down to you, Harold.

37:32.901 --> 37:34.511
You've had it under control.

37:34.611 --> 37:37.264
Now do yourself a favour
and get this lot under control

37:37.364 --> 37:39.787
before the heavy mob is on you
like a ton of hot horse shit.

37:40.408 --> 37:42.535
Give us that case.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.897
Get that checked out, will you?

37:45.997 --> 37:48.920
- What is it?
- It's the bomb from the casino.

37:50.085 --> 37:52.153
Are you riding around
with a bleedin' bomb?

37:52.253 --> 37:54.676
It's all right, it's been disconnected.

37:55.423 --> 37:57.576
I'll get the bomb people
to have a look at it.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.144
No Parky, get it checked out
privately, right?

38:00.929 --> 38:03.102
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

38:06.351 --> 38:09.149
I want the name of your top grass.

38:11.106 --> 38:12.757
No way, Harold.

38:12.857 --> 38:16.110
- I'll get more out of him than you can.
- That's true.

38:16.820 --> 38:22.326
You do realise how much this deal
is gonna be worth in 1988, yeah?

38:22.617 --> 38:24.915
Billions.

38:25.537 --> 38:29.041
I'll cut in you in for a percentage
for the name of your grass.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.570
- He trusts me, Harold.
- I trust you.

38:33.670 --> 38:35.780
I've known him a lot of years.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.382
Then you should remember
his name, shouldn't you'?

38:40.677 --> 38:43.305
- If I give it to you...
- No ifs, Parky.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.767
A percentage?

38:50.937 --> 38:52.297
Erroll.

38:52.397 --> 38:55.116
- Erroll the Ponce from Brixton?
- Yeah.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.311
Can't trust nobody.
Did you hear all that?

39:06.411 --> 39:08.647
- Yeah.
- Brixton.

39:23.678 --> 39:25.304
Oi.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.020
Which one's Erroll's house?

39:30.727 --> 39:33.150
Never heard of him, man.

39:33.980 --> 39:37.450
Razors, little bit of respect here,
I think.

39:47.035 --> 39:48.878
Fucking hell!

39:48.995 --> 39:50.689
What are you doing?

39:50.789 --> 39:52.232
Are you crazy?

39:52.332 --> 39:55.506
I don't like people looking up
my nose when I'm talking to 'em.

39:55.668 --> 39:57.465
He could have killed me.

39:58.046 --> 39:59.155
The way it's been going today,

39:59.255 --> 40:01.723
I'll probably get you
a cut-price funeral.

40:04.135 --> 40:06.182
Now Erroll's house, which one is it?

40:07.639 --> 40:09.607
Number 33.

40:11.142 --> 40:16.068
This used to be a nice street, this.
Decent families, no scum.

40:37.252 --> 40:40.029
Beauty and the beast. Blow his head off.

40:40.129 --> 40:41.948
Hey...

40:42.048 --> 40:44.926
Are you in training
or are you doing this for pleasure?

40:45.510 --> 40:50.123
- We had a party last night.
- Booze, bints and pox, eh?

40:50.223 --> 40:52.976
Harold, get him to take
that metal out of my earhole.

40:53.101 --> 40:57.947
No, I'm disgusted. Shoot him,
let's put some muck on the ceiling.

40:58.398 --> 41:00.049
Please! What do you want?

41:00.149 --> 41:01.593
You seen anything of my Eric

41:01.693 --> 41:04.116
flying past your window
about two hours ago, eh?

41:05.363 --> 41:07.265
What are you talking about?

41:07.365 --> 41:11.620
Come on, downstairs.
Down to the kitchen with you, my son.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.545
I want verbals with you.

41:14.747 --> 41:18.547
Put some deodorant on.
I'm heavily into personal protection.

41:35.935 --> 41:37.732
Filth.

41:38.813 --> 41:42.408
Is there no decency
in this disgusting world?

41:43.026 --> 41:46.621
Here, while he's with us,
give yourself another prick.

41:56.289 --> 41:58.541
Tell him what your name is.

41:59.584 --> 42:01.301
Razors.

42:02.337 --> 42:05.198
Otherwise known as Clapham Junction.

42:05.298 --> 42:09.223
Or as the youth of today call him:
The Human Spirograph.

42:11.638 --> 42:14.082
65 inches of stitching.

42:14.182 --> 42:16.000
Now you're gonna feel
what it's like, boy.

42:16.100 --> 42:18.211
And he was a very popular fellow.

42:18.311 --> 42:20.063
Harold, what do you want?

42:22.273 --> 42:23.490
Well...

42:23.942 --> 42:28.117
I have it from a very reliable source,
that you know what's what,

42:29.072 --> 42:32.225
and you have ears and I wanna
know what you've heard.

42:32.325 --> 42:34.543
Look, am I supposed to know something?

42:35.662 --> 42:37.539
Razors.

42:39.332 --> 42:42.085
- What do you know about Colin?
- What about Colin?

42:42.460 --> 42:44.279
I don't know nothing about Colin.

42:44.379 --> 42:46.597
Look Harold, I've been here all night.

42:47.006 --> 42:48.491
Look, what's up?

42:48.591 --> 42:50.827
Someone's been playing
Guy Fawkes with my Rolls,

42:50.927 --> 42:53.976
and a touch of Jaws in the lido.
That's what's up, mate.

42:56.849 --> 42:58.293
What about Eric?

42:58.393 --> 43:00.440
- Eric?
- You heard.

43:02.522 --> 43:04.649
Well, he doesn't like Colin.

43:04.857 --> 43:07.802
I mean, queers get
right up his hooter, you know?

43:07.902 --> 43:11.618
After what happened this morning,
you'd have to find his hooter to get up it.

43:11.948 --> 43:14.041
Is something up with him, then?

43:14.325 --> 43:17.294
Well, let's put it this way:

43:17.495 --> 43:21.733
apart from his arsehole being about
fifty yards away from his brains,

43:21.833 --> 43:25.712
and the choirboys playing hunt the thimble
for the rest of him, he ain't too happy.

43:25.812 --> 43:30.182
- Well, I haven't heard anything.
- Well, use your Scouse ears.

43:39.267 --> 43:44.130
Listen, Erroll, the only decent grass
is the grass that grasses to me, right?

43:44.230 --> 43:46.448
Harold, if I knew something...

43:51.946 --> 43:53.993
Colin's been stabbed!

43:56.284 --> 43:59.604
Well, his boyfriend used to
come hereto score,

43:59.704 --> 44:02.565
but he never said nothing
so I know nothing.

44:02.665 --> 44:04.567
I mean, a lot of people
come here to score,

44:04.667 --> 44:07.779
but we sell very good shit.

44:07.879 --> 44:09.676
Like you?

44:09.839 --> 44:13.058
- Who's got it in for me?
- I don't know!

44:13.593 --> 44:15.140
Cut him.

44:20.266 --> 44:22.518
I still can't hear anything.

44:26.856 --> 44:29.358
I don't fucking know!

44:43.122 --> 44:44.748
Minded your car, mister.

44:45.083 --> 44:47.176
You should've asked for the money first.

44:47.376 --> 44:49.970
I could've slashed your tyres.

44:54.008 --> 44:57.432
Here you are, go and get drunk.

45:03.684 --> 45:05.461
Little acorns, eh?

45:05.561 --> 45:07.296
From little acorns grow...

45:07.396 --> 45:10.365
Exactly, that's how I started.

45:10.483 --> 45:12.593
- Didn't we all?
- Not Jeff.

45:12.693 --> 45:14.637
Busy getting himself an education,
weren't ya?

45:14.737 --> 45:19.083
- Different generation, that's all.
- Billiard halls was my game.

45:19.242 --> 45:21.619
Remember old Sammy? Sammy?

45:22.120 --> 45:26.170
I tore up two of his tables in a week.
He used to pay me not to play.

45:30.753 --> 45:32.530
What do you think?

45:32.630 --> 45:36.054
Look, you told the Yanks
you control it here.

45:36.217 --> 45:38.202
If they're sticking
that many million in it,

45:38.302 --> 45:41.372
if they wanna test you do control it.

45:41.472 --> 45:44.751
Nah, it's way off the mark. Leave off!

45:44.851 --> 45:46.711
They might check books and finances

45:46.811 --> 45:48.755
but they're not going to start
wiping out me firm, are they?

45:48.855 --> 45:51.278
They don't want anarchy.

45:55.695 --> 45:58.118
These people deserve something
better than this.

45:59.907 --> 46:02.876
Not dog shit on the doorstep.

46:22.722 --> 46:24.519
So nothing?

46:24.932 --> 46:28.586
- Not a word, or no one's heard.
- No one's heard nothing?

46:28.686 --> 46:30.813
That just ain't natural.

46:32.908 --> 46:35.218
It's like one of them
silent, deadly farts.

46:35.318 --> 46:37.820
No clues, and then pow,
you go cross-eyed.

46:38.070 --> 46:39.597
We've asked all the usual.

46:39.697 --> 46:42.141
Well maybe it's about time
you asked the unusual, innit?

46:42.241 --> 46:43.684
Like who?

46:43.784 --> 46:46.662
- All the chaps are out asking, H.
- What, you've given up?

46:47.288 --> 46:50.066
- Where are they?
- Down the casino.

46:50.166 --> 46:53.135
Well get them off their arses
and make them start again, right?

46:53.711 --> 46:55.838
Go on, what are you waiting for?

47:05.156 --> 47:08.275
- Have you heard from Parky?
- Not yet.

47:09.352 --> 47:11.980
Eugene will phone
the minute he checks in.

47:13.105 --> 47:15.357
- Razors is back with the car.
- Eh?

47:16.025 --> 47:18.198
Dinner at the pub.

47:19.111 --> 47:20.638
Oh, Christ.

47:20.738 --> 47:23.161
You gotta entertain 'em a bit,
haven't ya?

47:29.497 --> 47:30.481
You refreshed?

47:30.581 --> 47:32.775
You bet, I'm ready
for your tightest schedule.

47:32.875 --> 47:36.424
Nah, like you said, Charlie,
it's not a horse race. Relax, eh?

47:36.587 --> 47:38.948
Sorry to hear the news, Harold.

47:39.048 --> 47:41.300
Victoria was just telling us about it.

47:43.469 --> 47:48.019
Yes, well she hasn't been well for a
long time, has she, Harold? Poor mother.

47:48.140 --> 47:51.544
Don't worry, she'll be all right.
She's a fighter, you know.

47:51.644 --> 47:53.838
But I had to spend some time
with her, you understand.

47:53.938 --> 47:55.590
That's nice.

47:55.690 --> 47:58.113
Well, shall we go? Dinner?

47:58.317 --> 48:01.491
It's my favourite pub, Charlie.
You're gonna love it, I'm telling ya.

48:07.451 --> 48:10.374
I bought this pub
about two years ago, Charlie.

48:10.830 --> 48:12.940
To stop the breweries
turning it into a slum.

48:13.040 --> 48:15.693
It's got real Old London character.
You'll love it.

48:15.793 --> 48:17.445
That's nice.

48:17.545 --> 48:19.155
I'll take the councillor in the Merc.

48:19.255 --> 48:21.741
Oh, God help me.
Have you seen him drive?

48:21.841 --> 48:24.059
You can always walk, sunshine.

49:24.945 --> 49:26.742
Let me out!

49:27.031 --> 49:28.557
Stand back! Stand back!

49:28.657 --> 49:31.125
It might still be dangerous. Stay back!

49:43.798 --> 49:46.033
- Are you all right, Pete?
- I'm all right.

49:46.133 --> 49:47.368
What about your customers?

49:47.468 --> 49:49.203
I don't know. I think they're all right.

49:49.303 --> 49:51.225
It blew up there,
there was no one up there.

49:54.183 --> 49:55.730
Jesus.

49:58.729 --> 50:00.981
If we've been five minutes earlier...

50:02.775 --> 50:04.343
Yeah.

50:04.443 --> 50:05.886
What the hell's going on?

50:05.986 --> 50:08.955
- Keep 'em there, Jeff. It's not safe.
- Yeah, alright.

50:10.950 --> 50:13.748
- What is it?
- You go and help Pete, right?

50:15.246 --> 50:16.897
Occupy 'em.

50:16.997 --> 50:20.501
Anything that's necessary.
Just buy me some time, right?

50:20.876 --> 50:23.029
Yeah, er... I'll take them to Justine's.

50:23.129 --> 50:24.113
Terrific.

50:24.213 --> 50:26.465
- Get Razors to book a table.
- Yeah.

50:28.217 --> 50:30.453
- It was the gas.
- Gas?

50:30.553 --> 50:33.956
This natural gas causes
dangerous leaks sometimes.

50:34.056 --> 50:35.833
Harold wants us to go on
to a restaurant,

50:35.933 --> 50:39.812
while he's dealing with it.
He'll join us later.

50:39.937 --> 50:42.256
Jeff, stay with Harold, will you?
I'll drive.

50:48.070 --> 50:51.557
Stand well back! Please stand well back!

50:51.657 --> 50:54.809
There may be more explosions.

50:55.570 --> 50:59.965
...need to get through.
Stand well back. Thank you.

51:08.299 --> 51:11.723
Well, that French cook was taking
a lot of trouble, but this is ridiculous.

51:11.886 --> 51:13.746
How'd they get in here
in the first place?

51:13.846 --> 51:14.789
Ah, leave off, H.

51:14.889 --> 51:17.083
You know how many people
come up here during the night.

51:17.183 --> 51:19.919
What, nobody spotted nothing?
Nothing at all?

51:20.019 --> 51:21.941
Nothing happened tonight, mate.

51:22.605 --> 51:25.216
Mind you, a couple of days ago
two guys come up.

51:25.316 --> 51:26.817
They wanted protection.

51:27.860 --> 51:30.554
I thought they were comedians:
they had big hats, sunglasses,

51:30.654 --> 51:33.998
I thought the agency sent them
down for cabaret.

51:34.241 --> 51:37.540
Protection? Out on my boozer?

51:37.745 --> 51:39.480
What, he actually made threats?

51:39.580 --> 51:43.505
Yeah, I told 'em to piss off.
I took no notice of 'em.

51:46.045 --> 51:48.489
- Much obliged.
- I'm sorry, mate, you know...

51:48.589 --> 51:51.012
Didn't wanna worry you. Sorry.

51:52.343 --> 51:54.345
Razors, come here.

51:55.262 --> 51:57.665
Get on the trumpet.
I want all the corporation

51:57.765 --> 52:00.334
at the Mayfair Casino
in half an hour. Right?

52:00.434 --> 52:04.171
And I want 'em all there.
I don't want any excuses.

52:04.271 --> 52:06.549
I'm gonna nail these bastards, right?

52:06.649 --> 52:09.552
- You don't know who they are, H.
- Well we're gonna find out, aren't we?

52:09.652 --> 52:11.971
It's getting dark.
People get frightened in the dark.

52:12.071 --> 52:13.973
They talk, don't they?

52:14.073 --> 52:15.950
Hello, Parky,

52:16.158 --> 52:18.660
I'm afraid the dinner's
got a little bit burnt.

52:23.666 --> 52:25.985
What did these comedians look like?

52:26.085 --> 52:28.154
I don't know, H,
I've never seen them before.

52:28.254 --> 52:31.699
They just looked like any other Micks.
Heavy Micks.

52:31.799 --> 52:34.347
- Micks?
- Yeah, you know, Irish.

52:34.635 --> 52:36.728
Quite hard looking Paddies.

52:36.845 --> 52:40.394
I never dreamed
they'd do this, mate. I'm sorry.

52:41.350 --> 52:42.943
Harold.

52:47.731 --> 52:50.575
Irish, he said. Irish.

52:50.818 --> 52:53.262
This is Special Branch, Harold.
It ain't normal villainy.

52:53.362 --> 52:55.931
It's indecently abnormal.
That was meant for me.

52:56.031 --> 52:58.100
It's serious.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.917
Listen.

53:00.744 --> 53:04.565
Check out all the Micks in the heavy mob
who are working on my manor.

53:04.665 --> 53:06.692
I want names and addresses, right?

53:06.792 --> 53:09.195
Will you listen to
what I'm trying to tell you?

53:09.295 --> 53:11.923
- This is very serious.
- Oh, leave off.

53:12.256 --> 53:14.867
It's just villains trying to
frighten their way into a few quid.

53:14.967 --> 53:18.537
Harold, we're talking about bombs.
Two bleedin' bombs.

53:18.637 --> 53:20.122
Did you get that one checked out,
by the way?

53:20.222 --> 53:23.608
Still waiting for the report
Well, get a fucking move on.

53:23.851 --> 53:27.588
Harold, if that bomb is Irish,
it's a different game.

53:27.688 --> 53:29.215
Those boyos don't know the rules.

53:29.315 --> 53:32.113
Names and addresses of the Micks, right?

53:36.322 --> 53:38.599
Two or three Micks have been very busy,

53:38.699 --> 53:42.419
covering a lot of ground here
since yesterday,

53:43.078 --> 53:45.751
and not one of you lot
has turned up with a thing.

53:46.290 --> 53:49.443
It's impossible no one knows nothing.

53:49.543 --> 53:53.138
Someone, somewhere, knows. Right?

53:53.881 --> 53:56.179
And we're gonna find him.

53:56.467 --> 54:01.080
I want a top capture from every manor,
and I don't want no punters.

54:01.180 --> 54:04.775
This is personal,
I want the man who knows.

54:05.267 --> 54:08.771
Right. Who fancies what?

54:11.148 --> 54:14.051
Well, me and Chris will take Soho.
We'll go and see Maltese Charlie.

54:14.151 --> 54:16.369
A couple of drinks and he'll talk.

54:16.945 --> 54:18.430
Use that, it's cheaper.

54:18.530 --> 54:20.766
Remember, the license is in the post.

54:20.866 --> 54:24.353
Well, I only use it to get the pigeons
off the caravan roof, don't I?

54:26.455 --> 54:29.629
I don't want want none of you playing
Roy Rogers with this lot, right?

54:29.833 --> 54:32.653
As soon as you've finished with 'em,
you give 'em back to Razors.

54:32.753 --> 54:34.405
How about the Finsbury Park Hillbillies?

54:34.505 --> 54:37.074
I like the singsong,
but who do you fancy for a lullaby?

54:37.174 --> 54:40.369
- Well, Chopper's in the boob.
- Harry and Pinchers?

54:40.469 --> 54:42.204
- Both of 'em?
- Why not?

54:42.304 --> 54:44.456
They're like Siamese twins, them two.

54:44.556 --> 54:46.875
Pick 'em up together,
then split 'em apart.

54:46.975 --> 54:49.398
We'll interfere with
their telepathy, right?

54:50.187 --> 54:52.381
Has anybody seen the Major lately?

54:52.481 --> 54:55.092
I heard he's a sick man. Bedridden.

54:55.192 --> 54:58.345
It will make a nice change for him,
a night out. Eh?

54:58.445 --> 55:00.848
Right, arm up and get going.

55:00.948 --> 55:02.975
And use the butcher's truck, right?

55:03.075 --> 55:05.978
Me and Razors will take the trip
to the Elephant and Castle.

55:06.078 --> 55:08.647
- Where do we meet?
- Two hours from now at the abattoir.

55:08.747 --> 55:12.234
And remember: scare the shit
out of 'em but don't damage 'em.

55:12.334 --> 55:14.695
I want 'em conscious and talkative.

55:14.795 --> 55:16.592
And lads...

55:18.340 --> 55:20.387
try and be discreet, eh?

55:44.742 --> 55:46.769
I think we'd be employing
your talents better

55:46.869 --> 55:49.292
if you went to help Victoria
with the Yanks.

55:49.955 --> 55:52.253
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

55:53.959 --> 55:55.756
Do you reckon...

55:57.004 --> 55:59.723
Colin was jealous of you?

56:00.090 --> 56:01.967
Come again?

56:02.843 --> 56:07.439
Well, I was trying to ease him out,
you know how potty he could go.

56:07.848 --> 56:09.770
So?

56:10.434 --> 56:13.312
Well, is Colin the reason for all this?

56:13.479 --> 56:17.609
You know how bitchy queers get
when their looks start fading...

56:17.983 --> 56:21.077
I don't know, he wasn't my type.

56:22.780 --> 56:27.501
- How do you stay so cool?
- I'm on the winning side.

56:28.535 --> 56:30.161
Yeah.

56:31.371 --> 56:34.249
- Help Vicky out, right?
- Yeah.

56:35.417 --> 56:38.862
But I want you at the abattoir
by midnight, right?

56:38.962 --> 56:40.588
All right.

56:52.559 --> 56:54.169
Thank you, Ricardo.

56:54.269 --> 56:56.588
If I knew Mr. Shand
wanted this table tonight...

56:56.688 --> 56:58.966
Well there was a change of plan.

56:59.066 --> 57:01.113
You can say that again.

57:01.360 --> 57:03.703
Would you care for a drink
before you order?

57:05.280 --> 57:06.724
Charlie?

57:06.824 --> 57:10.227
- Yeah, bourbon on the rocks.
- I'll have the same, please.

57:10.327 --> 57:12.354
A screwdriver, lots of vodka.

57:12.454 --> 57:14.547
San Pellegrino for me, please.

57:14.706 --> 57:17.234
I think we should skip
the flambé cooking,

57:17.334 --> 57:19.757
considering the gas situation in London.

57:20.712 --> 57:23.590
That sort of thing doesn't
happen twice in one day.

57:24.383 --> 57:26.601
You should level with us.

57:28.053 --> 57:31.022
We're not just a pair of jerks
out of college, you know.

57:32.683 --> 57:34.626
No, absolutely not.

57:34.726 --> 57:37.820
Two bombs, that affects everyone.

57:38.647 --> 57:40.569
Let's order, shall we?

57:40.899 --> 57:44.118
Soupe du jour and the chef's special.

57:46.280 --> 57:48.032
I'll have my usual.

57:48.991 --> 57:53.621
No soup, hors d'oeuvres and the special.

57:55.414 --> 57:57.291
I'll have the same.

57:57.499 --> 58:01.445
So Charlie, how did you
know about the bombs?

58:01.545 --> 58:03.947
It's our business to know these things.

58:04.047 --> 58:06.766
And Ricardo,
a bottle of champagne, very cold.

58:09.636 --> 58:12.080
Harold has got bad problems.

58:12.180 --> 58:16.526
- But he's dealing with them right now.
- He's been dealing with them all day.

58:16.685 --> 58:20.422
- He's very thorough.
- I like your loyalty.

58:20.522 --> 58:22.740
I'm being frank.

58:22.983 --> 58:26.762
Victoria, unless you tell us
what Harold's bad problems are

58:26.862 --> 58:28.597
and how he's dealing with them,

58:28.697 --> 58:31.350
I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do.

58:31.450 --> 58:33.435
Tony and me,
we're gonna leave the table,

58:33.535 --> 58:35.958
we're gonna check out of the Savoy,

58:36.246 --> 58:38.899
grab the first plane home.

58:38.999 --> 58:40.967
There will be no deal.

58:41.919 --> 58:44.467
It's not a good idea
to bullshit us, Victoria.

58:47.049 --> 58:49.017
Cheers.

58:51.762 --> 58:53.764
Well?

58:56.558 --> 58:58.856
A car was blown up,

58:59.394 --> 59:01.547
then a bomb was found
at the Mayfair Casino.

59:01.647 --> 59:03.924
It hadn't detonated.

59:04.024 --> 59:06.677
One of our men was found
dead in a swimming pool.

59:06.777 --> 59:08.303
Yeah, he was stabbed.

59:08.403 --> 59:11.223
I'm giving Charlie
all the essential details.

59:11.323 --> 59:13.450
Well, I think that is
an essential detail.

59:15.077 --> 59:18.814
Auto, casino, stabbing,
a bar blown up...

59:18.914 --> 59:22.359
- What is this, a gang war?
- No, no question.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.256
Then what?

59:24.503 --> 59:28.849
Isn't it obvious, Charlie? This deal
is very big, someone is envious.

59:29.633 --> 59:33.262
Harold and I have no doubt that
by tomorrow the problem will be settled.

59:33.387 --> 59:36.857
- You sound very confident.
- I am.

59:38.600 --> 59:41.649
Tony, you're the lawyer.
Tell me what you think.

59:44.648 --> 59:47.968
I think we can afford to give you
24 hours to resolve your problems

59:48.068 --> 59:50.536
before we make a final decision.

59:52.030 --> 59:55.249
OK, Victoria,
I'll give you till tomorrow.

59:56.243 --> 01:00:00.480
But just one more foul-up and
we're on our way back home.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.627
That goes without saying.

01:00:05.544 --> 01:00:08.593
Nothing personal, Victoria,
but business is business.

01:00:08.964 --> 01:00:10.556
I understand.

01:00:58.096 --> 01:01:00.457
Harold, what are you doing
this side of the river?

01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:02.250
You're straying a bit, aren't you?

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:04.127
How's it going, Billy, all right?

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:06.171
- Scotch?
- Sorry to hear about your mother.

01:01:06.271 --> 01:01:09.069
Car blew up, didn't it?
That's what I heard.

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:11.551
What's up, Harold?
You got a spot of bother?

01:01:11.651 --> 01:01:13.261
No, no.

01:01:13.361 --> 01:01:15.097
The music's loud in here, innit?

01:01:15.197 --> 01:01:17.495
- I'll get him to turn it down a bit.
- No, listen, Billy.

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:20.519
I've got a little bit of business
I want to drop your way.

01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:21.895
Can we talk in the other bar?

01:01:21.995 --> 01:01:23.355
- Right.
- Nice one.

01:01:23.455 --> 01:01:25.673
Jimmy, bring the drinks around the back.

01:01:33.173 --> 01:01:35.158
I heard about this
American number, Harold.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.119
If there's anything going, put me in.

01:01:37.219 --> 01:01:39.663
Well, the thing is, Billy, there's
plenty of money for everybody,

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:41.957
I just need the right people,
you know what I mean?

01:01:42.057 --> 01:01:44.480
Well I'm your man, you know.

01:01:46.978 --> 01:01:49.856
Walk to the car, Billy,
or I'll blow your spine off.

01:01:50.941 --> 01:01:52.426
It's not a shooter is it, Harold?

01:01:52.526 --> 01:01:54.302
Oh, don't be silly, Billy.

01:01:54.402 --> 01:01:56.825
Would I come hunting for you
with me fingers?

01:02:02.202 --> 01:02:04.563
It's all gonna happen,
with or without Harold.

01:02:04.663 --> 01:02:07.482
My hotels are gonna be there!

01:02:07.582 --> 01:02:09.192
Will you get us a cab to the Savoy?

01:02:09.292 --> 01:02:11.653
I'll show you the plans tomorrow.

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:13.196
Magnificent.

01:02:13.296 --> 01:02:16.283
High in the sky hotels,
well, you know what I mean.

01:02:16.383 --> 01:02:18.326
Something to be proud of.

01:02:18.426 --> 01:02:20.120
Yes, well I think it's time
we all went home, don't you?

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.123
No, come on, Victoria.
Charlie understands.

01:02:23.223 --> 01:02:24.624
You understand, don't you, Charlie?

01:02:24.724 --> 01:02:26.126
We're two of a kind, me and him.

01:02:26.226 --> 01:02:28.503
We've had to claw our way
out from the gutter.

01:02:28.603 --> 01:02:31.026
We're self-made men, right, Charles?

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:35.302
I don't think Mr. Restivo is as familiar
with the gutter as you assume.

01:02:35.402 --> 01:02:38.472
If you don't watch your fucking step,
councillor, you'll be right back in it.

01:02:38.572 --> 01:02:40.574
Come on Vicky, don't be like that.

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:45.270
I'll tell you what...

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.481
we'll have some more brandies
at the bar, eh?

01:02:47.581 --> 01:02:50.004
And I'll tell you
all about my plans, Charlie.

01:02:50.542 --> 01:02:52.778
Don't be hostile, Vicky.

01:02:52.878 --> 01:02:55.405
- Jeff.
- Hello Jeff.

01:02:55.505 --> 01:02:56.990
Charlie.

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.637
Tony.

01:02:59.217 --> 01:03:01.719
- Everything all right?
- You tell me...

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:05.473
I've put our American friends
in the picture about today, Jeff.

01:03:06.099 --> 01:03:09.148
Oh, then you'll understand
why Harold couldn't make it.

01:03:09.644 --> 01:03:10.962
It's all under control.

01:03:11.062 --> 01:03:13.882
Oh, I'm sure Harold Shand
can find a way out of this one.

01:03:13.982 --> 01:03:17.861
Meantime, I'm going to have a piss.
Stay right where you are, folks.

01:03:20.155 --> 01:03:23.750
- That guy's a loudmouth.
- I don't like drunks.

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:25.936
Do you trust him?

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:28.522
Harold can handle him.

01:03:28.622 --> 01:03:32.171
A city councillor is a very wise
investment at the moment.

01:03:32.334 --> 01:03:34.402
We'll talk about that tomorrow.
Good night, Victoria.

01:03:34.502 --> 01:03:35.945
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:03:36.045 --> 01:03:37.197
Good night.

01:03:37.297 --> 01:03:40.200
- Good night. Thanks for the dinner.
- Good night, Charlie.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.347
Good night.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.455
Oh, Christ, am I pleased to see you!

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.728
That bloody Harris is a liability.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.585
Any news?

01:03:50.685 --> 01:03:52.129
No, not yet.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:54.256
Where have the Yanks gone?
I've just bought some more brandies.

01:03:54.356 --> 01:03:56.449
Go home, Harris. Go home.

01:03:57.651 --> 01:04:00.053
Don't look down
your nose at me, Victoria.

01:04:00.153 --> 01:04:01.471
It makes you go cross-eyed.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:04.995
You can't even see that
I'm not the real bastard. He is.

01:04:09.204 --> 01:04:11.047
Aren't you?

01:04:11.998 --> 01:04:14.466
I'll get you a cab home, councillor.

01:04:14.834 --> 01:04:16.862
I'll talk to you later.

01:04:16.962 --> 01:04:18.655
OK.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.552
Bastard.

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:44.572
God, I don't think I've ever been
so pleased to see anyone in my life.

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:49.080
It's been a hard night.

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:52.417
You did a good job.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.792
Without the helpful Councillor Harris.

01:04:59.004 --> 01:05:01.051
He fancies you, you know...

01:05:03.174 --> 01:05:05.472
then a lot of people do.

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:15.316
Must be my sparkling personality.

01:05:49.137 --> 01:05:52.641
I'll see you to your door, just in case.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.393
Thanks.

01:05:57.354 --> 01:05:59.777
If you miss it, it's unlucky.

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:09.870
It won't move unless
you press the button, you know.

01:06:20.293 --> 01:06:21.778
It's not moving.

01:06:21.878 --> 01:06:24.221
It's temperamental, I'll do it.

01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.142
I hate lifts.

01:06:36.267 --> 01:06:39.236
Gets really claustrophobic in here
with a lot of people.

01:06:41.648 --> 01:06:43.900
Depends on the people.

01:07:06.381 --> 01:07:09.350
I wanna lick every inch of you.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.396
Saved by the bell. Good night.

01:08:04.689 --> 01:08:06.691
Bastard.

01:08:33.635 --> 01:08:36.621
It's a long time
since I've been to a funeral.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.268
That's a strange thing.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:41.000
Did Jeff tell you about the funeral
the day you got back?

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.069
A funeral every half hour
down the East India Dock Road.

01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:47.490
A woman got out of the funeral car
and gobbed at him.

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:50.993
- Eh?
- I didn't see it properly, H.

01:08:51.194 --> 01:08:52.979
I didn't crack on.

01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.965
You're gonna love this here.

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:07.585
You're gonna love this.

01:09:45.163 --> 01:09:47.587
Shut up all of ya!

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:16.283
For more than ten years
there's been peace.

01:10:17.238 --> 01:10:19.933
Everyone to his own patch.

01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:22.456
We've all had it sweet.

01:10:23.328 --> 01:10:27.607
I've done every single one of you
favours in the past.

01:10:27.707 --> 01:10:31.611
I've put money in all your pockets.
I've treated you lot well.

01:10:31.711 --> 01:10:34.305
Even when you was out of order, right?

01:10:38.092 --> 01:10:40.765
Well now there's been an eruption!

01:10:43.389 --> 01:10:46.563
It's like fuckin' Belfast
on a bad night.

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:53.508
One of my closest friends
is lying out there in the freezer.

01:10:53.608 --> 01:10:55.301
And believe me, all of you.

01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:59.597
Nobody goes home
until I find out who done it, and why.

01:10:59.697 --> 01:11:03.246
Harold, believe me, if I knew I'd say.

01:11:04.035 --> 01:11:06.754
The last thing I want is any trouble.

01:11:06.954 --> 01:11:10.358
- Everything's going too well for us.
- You lying bastard.

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:14.737
Am I? Look, things have never been so good
between South London and the East End.

01:11:14.837 --> 01:11:20.093
You bastard. You rotten bastard.
Course he knows!

01:11:23.304 --> 01:11:26.978
- Get him out of here.
- Bastard!

01:11:27.308 --> 01:11:31.358
Oi! Jeff, you behave yourself!

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:39.278
Right lads, it's your decision.

01:11:40.947 --> 01:11:43.620
Frostbite or verbals,
one of the two, right?

01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:55.465
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen.

01:11:58.297 --> 01:11:59.741
Listen.

01:11:59.841 --> 01:12:02.827
If you kill him,
we've got gang war on our hands, right?

01:12:02.927 --> 01:12:06.080
We already have.
They're walking all over you.

01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.603
That's 'cause we ain't got no lead!

01:12:15.648 --> 01:12:19.093
Parky. About time.

01:12:19.193 --> 01:12:21.991
- Well?
- You've got to drop it Harold,

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:24.307
it's not that lot.

01:12:24.407 --> 01:12:26.809
- I've had the bomb checked.
- And?

01:12:26.909 --> 01:12:29.457
It's the same sort of device
the IRA use.

01:12:29.954 --> 01:12:32.940
This is Special Branch now, Harold.
I'm turning it over to them.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:35.258
What do the Irish got to do with me?

01:12:35.376 --> 01:12:37.403
It's just a bunch of hoods
trying to muscle in.

01:12:37.503 --> 01:12:39.489
For Christ's sake, Harold,
they're not just gangsters.

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:42.325
They run half of Londonderry on terror.
Could be London next.

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:44.243
Oh, no, I run London.

01:12:44.343 --> 01:12:47.246
Not now, Harold, they're
taking it away from you.

01:12:47.346 --> 01:12:50.099
It's Special Branch now,
and I'm getting out.

01:12:53.144 --> 01:12:57.990
Remember who pays your wages, Parky,
you ain't going nowhere.

01:12:59.192 --> 01:13:03.492
Now, tell me something worthwhile.

01:13:06.032 --> 01:13:10.582
There was a robbery at Councillor
Harris's demolition yard, explosives.

01:13:10.703 --> 01:13:14.107
We pulled in the security guard, Flynn.
We grilled him for hours,

01:13:14.207 --> 01:13:16.776
but he just wouldn't crack,
he was too scared.

01:13:16.876 --> 01:13:20.071
Alan, check out this geezer Flynn,
bring him in.

01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:22.093
Harold, you can't do that!

01:13:22.465 --> 01:13:25.809
Don't you ever tell me
what I can or can't do.

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:29.038
Bent law can be tolerated for
as long as they're lubricating,

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:31.561
but you have become definitely parched.

01:13:31.682 --> 01:13:34.210
If I was you, I'd run for cover
and close the hatch,

01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:38.110
cause you're gonna wind up on one of
those meat hooks, my son.

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:44.345
Right, let 'em go,
they don't know nothing.

01:13:44.445 --> 01:13:46.472
Jeff, clean 'em up and get them home.

01:13:46.572 --> 01:13:48.891
Give 'em a grand each expenses,
just keep 'em sweet.

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.788
What are you doing?

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.770
I'm gonna go home,
I need some time to think.

01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:56.149
Alan, first thing in the morning,
that security geezer, right?

01:13:56.249 --> 01:13:58.046
Razors, come on, son.

01:13:59.085 --> 01:14:02.338
Dave, do as he says,
put 'em in a bubble bath.

01:14:02.713 --> 01:14:05.090
- Eh?
- You heard.

01:14:06.092 --> 01:14:07.969
Come on, lads, let's be having you.

01:15:47.234 --> 01:15:49.486
How did it go with Charlie?

01:15:51.238 --> 01:15:53.683
Well, I stopped them going home.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:54.934
Going home?

01:15:55.034 --> 01:15:58.413
Yeah, they were going home.
They're not stupid.

01:15:59.372 --> 01:16:03.025
They knew it was a bomb,
and now they know the rest.

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:05.528
- How?
- I told them.

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:09.223
- You did what?
- I told them everything, Harold.

01:16:09.757 --> 01:16:11.850
I had to.

01:16:13.719 --> 01:16:15.596
Victoria,

01:16:16.639 --> 01:16:18.607
listen sweetheart,

01:16:19.266 --> 01:16:21.210
I'm setting up
the biggest deal in Europe,

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:23.504
with the hardest organisation

01:16:23.604 --> 01:16:26.027
since Hitler stuck a
swastika on his jockstrap.

01:16:26.899 --> 01:16:31.512
I've been to incredible lengths
all day to keep it incognito,

01:16:31.612 --> 01:16:36.162
and now you, over a sherry,
calmly tell the whole story.

01:16:36.409 --> 01:16:41.130
I had to tell them everything
or the deal would have been finished.

01:16:42.498 --> 01:16:45.818
Harold, your trouble is you just
don't understand their psychology.

01:16:45.918 --> 01:16:48.591
Bollocks, you smart-arsed prat.

01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:53.346
I can't talk to you.

01:16:54.468 --> 01:16:56.329
I'm going to bed. Good night.

01:16:56.429 --> 01:16:58.706
Come here! I'm talking to you!

01:16:58.806 --> 01:17:01.650
Don't treat me like one of your thugs.

01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.277
What's happening to me?

01:17:12.653 --> 01:17:14.450
I'm sorry.

01:17:14.722 --> 01:17:19.953
For ten years it's been calm,
no trouble.

01:17:20.478 --> 01:17:22.196
And now this.

01:17:25.916 --> 01:17:28.444
Listen, I wouldn't hurt you
for the world. Come here.

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:31.638
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so scared, Harold.

01:17:33.132 --> 01:17:35.384
I don't want to die.

01:17:35.634 --> 01:17:38.512
Don't let them kill us.

01:17:40.347 --> 01:17:42.144
Alright.

01:17:42.767 --> 01:17:44.735
It's alright.

01:17:54.028 --> 01:17:56.997
It will be alright, believe me.

01:19:12.857 --> 01:19:15.030
What is it, boy?

01:20:19.965 --> 01:20:21.933
For Christ's sake...

01:20:22.676 --> 01:20:24.473
Help me.

01:20:35.731 --> 01:20:37.663
Hurry.

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:45.699
I'm sorry, H.

01:20:46.116 --> 01:20:49.039
It's alright, Alan it's not your fault.
You weren't to blame.

01:20:49.286 --> 01:20:50.896
There's some fresh coffee
in the kitchen.

01:20:50.996 --> 01:20:52.940
Go and make yourself some breakfast.

01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:54.757
Ta.

01:21:07.221 --> 01:21:10.065
So someone got to him before you could.

01:21:12.977 --> 01:21:15.024
How did they know?

01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:19.199
- Or was it a coincidence?
- That's stretching it a bit, innit?

01:21:24.905 --> 01:21:27.624
That means it's someone close to home.

01:21:34.832 --> 01:21:38.802
You know, last night in the restaurant,
I had a funny feeling.

01:21:39.128 --> 01:21:43.178
Harris... being really strange.

01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:49.771
He said something to Jeff,
just as we were leaving.

01:21:51.015 --> 01:21:54.268
He said that I'd got it all wrong,
that Jeff was the real bastard.

01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.772
Why should he say that?

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:26.425
Hello, Razors?

01:22:26.884 --> 01:22:28.994
That funeral you told me about,

01:22:29.094 --> 01:22:32.206
something about
a bird gobbing in Jeff's face.

01:22:32.306 --> 01:22:33.791
That's right.

01:22:33.891 --> 01:22:36.519
Well, find that woman.
I wanna talk to her.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:40.609
Well, get her name and address
off the undertakers.

01:22:41.065 --> 01:22:43.259
How do I know? I wasn't there, was I?

01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:44.468
Look up the Yellow Pages.

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:46.991
There can't be that many
undertakers in the area.

01:22:48.113 --> 01:22:52.334
Right. And as soon as you've found her,
come and pick me up.

01:22:52.951 --> 01:22:55.670
Right. I'll see you. Ta-da.

01:23:29.113 --> 01:23:30.956
Mrs. Benson?

01:23:35.369 --> 01:23:37.896
You're a bastard, Harold Shand.

01:23:37.996 --> 01:23:40.339
A vicious bastard.

01:23:40.624 --> 01:23:43.944
You deserted him,
and left him to die in a stinking ditch,

01:23:44.044 --> 01:23:46.717
and you didn't have the decency to...

01:23:55.139 --> 01:23:58.167
- When did he die?
- Ten days ago. You should know.

01:23:58.267 --> 01:24:00.210
Where?

01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:02.107
Belfast.

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:05.403
Belfast?

01:24:06.942 --> 01:24:10.867
- What was he doing there?
- That Jeff Hughes sent him.

01:24:11.029 --> 01:24:14.016
- What?
- He was hired.

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:17.269
The blond one, that Colin,
always asked him

01:24:17.369 --> 01:24:19.792
to do the chauffeuring on the long runs.

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.333
- To chauffeur?
- A minicab.

01:24:27.004 --> 01:24:29.051
Your husband drove Colin...

01:24:32.509 --> 01:24:34.620
and he got topped in Belfast?

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:36.893
He was left there.

01:24:37.473 --> 01:24:40.567
I was left with all the arrangements,

01:24:42.019 --> 01:24:44.647
to bring the body back here...

01:24:45.564 --> 01:24:48.237
and not so much as a penny
for me and the kids.

01:24:50.444 --> 01:24:52.805
And Jeff Hughes hired him?

01:24:52.905 --> 01:24:54.702
Yes.

01:24:56.992 --> 01:24:59.478
And that bastard hasn't
paid me any compensation.

01:24:59.578 --> 01:25:01.563
All right, all right, all right.

01:25:01.663 --> 01:25:04.586
You'll get some compensation,
the corporation will look after you.

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:08.135
- Is there anything you need?
- I'll need a hundred quid a week.

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.510
Alright.

01:25:11.798 --> 01:25:13.925
Anything else you want?

01:25:16.261 --> 01:25:18.855
I just want him back.

01:25:38.909 --> 01:25:42.834
Get him a decent stone.
Send me the bill.

01:28:07.599 --> 01:28:10.443
- Drink?
- Yeah.

01:28:18.276 --> 01:28:22.531
- Do you ever worry about your liver?
- No, we're just good friends.

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:27.603
My mum used to have a go at
my old man about his boozing,

01:28:27.703 --> 01:28:28.770
and he always used to say:

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.919
"If you drink less than your doctor,
you're all right."

01:28:34.626 --> 01:28:36.753
It's hot in here, shall we go on deck?

01:28:36.962 --> 01:28:38.884
Hot?

01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:41.742
Are you hot?

01:28:41.842 --> 01:28:43.810
This'll cool you down.

01:28:51.309 --> 01:28:53.436
What did you want to talk about?

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:57.073
Shouldn't we be, well...

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.489
with all what's going on...

01:29:01.153 --> 01:29:03.371
Everything's alright.

01:29:03.655 --> 01:29:05.657
Alright?

01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:08.622
I'm using the word the way you use it.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:12.088
What?

01:29:13.874 --> 01:29:15.067
Alright?

01:29:15.167 --> 01:29:18.862
I remember vividly when you met me at
Heathrow off the plane from New York,

01:29:18.962 --> 01:29:22.511
I said "How's things been?",
and you said "Alright".

01:29:25.552 --> 01:29:28.430
- I'm not with you.
- Aren't ya?

01:29:29.389 --> 01:29:31.186
Top-up?

01:29:33.935 --> 01:29:36.713
Quite frankly,
I'm a bit flabbergasted...

01:29:36.813 --> 01:29:40.408
you forgot to mention this carry on
in Belfast while I've been away.

01:29:43.278 --> 01:29:44.971
Ah, that.

01:29:45.071 --> 01:29:47.198
Yeah, that.

01:29:47.908 --> 01:29:50.911
What about this minicab driver,
Phil Benson?

01:29:52.412 --> 01:29:53.772
He's...

01:29:53.872 --> 01:29:56.716
Well, he was a friend of Colin's.

01:29:57.375 --> 01:29:59.218
He got killed.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.114
It's a long story.

01:30:02.214 --> 01:30:06.014
- I know I should've told you, but...
- Well, tell me now.

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:08.203
What the bloody hell was Colin doing

01:30:08.303 --> 01:30:11.665
with a Limehouse
minicab driver in Belfast?

01:30:11.765 --> 01:30:13.642
Colin can't drive.

01:30:14.476 --> 01:30:16.478
Ah, that makes sense.

01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:20.865
Second question:
Belfast, what was he doing there?

01:30:21.650 --> 01:30:23.385
I know Colin fancied soldiers,

01:30:23.485 --> 01:30:25.987
but that's taking his buggering
a bit far, innit?

01:30:26.530 --> 01:30:30.375
- He had to make a delivery.
- A delivery of what?

01:30:30.492 --> 01:30:32.102
Come on, I'm curious!

01:30:32.202 --> 01:30:36.457
What, Chieftain tanks, bars of
chocolate, Fiesta Durexes, what?

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:38.942
Money.

01:30:39.042 --> 01:30:41.465
What, ain't they got
any banks out there?

01:30:41.628 --> 01:30:44.927
Well, what money, what for and who to?

01:30:46.716 --> 01:30:49.560
He was delivering for Harris.

01:30:52.848 --> 01:30:54.332
He had a problem.

01:30:54.432 --> 01:30:55.959
He was being leant on to deliver,

01:30:56.059 --> 01:30:59.233
to deliver money, I mean, to Belfast.

01:30:59.563 --> 01:31:01.798
Leant on by who?

01:31:01.898 --> 01:31:05.618
He's got 100 Micks on his labour force,
he's out of business without them.

01:31:06.444 --> 01:31:10.949
He was being leaned on to
organise a delivery. He asked me.

01:31:12.701 --> 01:31:17.877
So you got my Colin to deliver
for Harris money to Belfast?

01:31:18.748 --> 01:31:20.670
Yeah.

01:31:22.961 --> 01:31:25.259
Well, that is irregular.

01:31:25.630 --> 01:31:30.076
I don't approve of my men
delivering funds for the IRA.

01:31:30.176 --> 01:31:33.121
He had no choice.
He has to do what they ask.

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:35.564
Otherwise his buildings don't get built.

01:31:35.891 --> 01:31:39.645
That's why he never has a strike.
That's why we use Harris.

01:31:41.271 --> 01:31:43.398
Jesus Christ!

01:31:45.817 --> 01:31:49.196
Of all the faces here you could
have used, of all of them...

01:31:50.363 --> 01:31:54.037
you have to pick Colin
for a job like that?

01:32:03.293 --> 01:32:05.670
So he took a dip, yeah?

01:32:06.588 --> 01:32:08.635
Yeah, he stupidly helped himself.

01:32:09.049 --> 01:32:10.909
How much?

01:32:11.009 --> 01:32:13.182
- Five grand.
- Do what?

01:32:15.013 --> 01:32:18.858
You mean all this anarchy
is for five poxy grand?

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:24.022
And three of their top men
were wiped out.

01:32:26.149 --> 01:32:28.651
The night Colin delivered.

01:32:37.410 --> 01:32:41.606
So they put two and two together
and come up with the answer, ain't they?

01:32:41.706 --> 01:32:44.425
'Cos Colin's my man, it's down to me.

01:32:44.584 --> 01:32:47.086
I'm the one that's
grassed them up, aren't I?

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:49.468
This is all revenge.

01:32:49.673 --> 01:32:51.641
Yeah.

01:32:53.426 --> 01:32:55.303
Revenge.

01:32:56.763 --> 01:32:58.731
I'll fucking show them.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.695
That security guard, he could
give us a clue, couldn't he?

01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:09.576
- Did he say anything?
- Nah, not much when Alan got to him.

01:33:10.819 --> 01:33:12.262
No?

01:33:12.362 --> 01:33:16.287
Nah, Alan found him dying.
He'd been nailed to the floor.

01:33:20.453 --> 01:33:21.354
When was this, then?

01:33:21.454 --> 01:33:25.191
It must have been just after you
saw him and before Alan saw him.

01:33:25.291 --> 01:33:27.569
Otherwise you'd have noticed,
wouldn't you?

01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:30.071
I mean a geezer nailed to the floor,

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:32.782
a man of your education would definitely
have spotted that, wouldn't he?

01:33:32.882 --> 01:33:34.242
Now look...

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.594
Traitor! Fucking Judas!

01:33:36.845 --> 01:33:38.330
I didn't do nothing.

01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:42.918
Maybe you didn't nail the geezer, but
it's down to you all the same, isn't it?

01:33:43.018 --> 01:33:45.670
- It had nothing to do with me.
- Don't lie to me, boy,

01:33:45.770 --> 01:33:49.399
I can smell your lies
and I can smell something else and all,

01:33:49.941 --> 01:33:55.663
I can smell your greed and ambition,
and something disgusting like betrayal.

01:33:56.322 --> 01:33:58.016
Why, Jeff?

01:33:58.116 --> 01:33:59.684
Why?

01:33:59.784 --> 01:34:02.332
He threatened to kill me, I was scared.

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:17.535
- You put the finger on me, didn't you?
- I didn't. It was Harris.

01:34:17.635 --> 01:34:23.107
For Micks, pig-eyed Micks,
redneck terrorist scum.

01:34:23.558 --> 01:34:25.752
Don't blame me, blame Colin.

01:34:25.852 --> 01:34:27.545
Revenge?

01:34:27.645 --> 01:34:29.923
It's me who's gonna take revenge.

01:34:30.023 --> 01:34:31.991
I'll crush them like beetles.

01:34:32.525 --> 01:34:35.971
- Never.
- You watch, I'm gonna annihilate them.

01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:39.745
- You can't wipe them out.
- You just watch me.

01:34:40.366 --> 01:34:45.271
Kill ten, twenty, bring out the tanks
and the flamethrowers,

01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:48.340
They pour back.
It's like an army of ants.

01:34:49.167 --> 01:34:50.652
Work with them.

01:34:50.752 --> 01:34:54.096
- It's my manor!
- Jesus Christ.

01:34:54.631 --> 01:34:58.576
The British Army has been diving about,
with shit flying at 'em from all angles,

01:34:58.676 --> 01:35:00.495
for the last ten years,
and you're not impressed?

01:35:00.595 --> 01:35:01.579
Shut up.

01:35:01.679 --> 01:35:03.248
They can take over here
any time they want.

01:35:03.348 --> 01:35:05.875
- Just shut up.
- You won't stop them.

01:35:05.975 --> 01:35:09.194
To them you're nothing, nothing,
the shit on their shoes.

01:36:55.585 --> 01:36:57.302
Jeff...

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:02.633
He was with Harris.

01:37:03.092 --> 01:37:05.310
He's done me over.

01:37:06.679 --> 01:37:08.289
I'm gonna kill him.

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:09.707
Razors!

01:37:09.807 --> 01:37:12.275
Gimme that fucking gun!

01:37:12.852 --> 01:37:15.275
- Razors!
- Harold!

01:37:16.314 --> 01:37:18.487
Take it easy.

01:37:19.025 --> 01:37:21.368
- Calm down..
- Give me the gun.

01:37:27.242 --> 01:37:29.811
You've got Harris, right?

01:37:29.911 --> 01:37:31.563
You've got him.

01:37:31.663 --> 01:37:37.215
Now you use him. You use him to stop
this bloody havoc, right?

01:40:05.274 --> 01:40:08.594
- Councillor Harris's office please.
- Yes, sir. I'll show you the way.

01:40:08.694 --> 01:40:11.413
- Thank you.
- He's on the second floor.

01:40:13.157 --> 01:40:16.602
- A friend of yours, sir?
- Yes, a very old friend, yeah.

01:40:16.702 --> 01:40:20.206
Nice man, Councillor Harris.
And a hard worker.

01:40:21.249 --> 01:40:23.067
Been on that bloody phone all afternoon.

01:40:23.167 --> 01:40:24.213
Has he?

01:40:25.044 --> 01:40:27.613
He's done a lot for the Irish
community round here, has he?

01:40:27.713 --> 01:40:29.949
So they tell me, yes.

01:40:30.049 --> 01:40:32.118
Do you know, it's three weeks
since they turned over

01:40:32.218 --> 01:40:34.537
the pages of the Book of Remembrance?

01:40:34.637 --> 01:40:36.664
There's a work to rule.

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:37.915
I said to the union bloke,

01:40:38.015 --> 01:40:40.001
I said it's a good job they didn't
work to rule in 14-18

01:40:40.101 --> 01:40:42.649
in the trenches in France.

01:40:56.117 --> 01:40:58.415
- Is this it?
- The very same.

01:40:58.661 --> 01:41:00.396
Are you gonna need me to
show you the way down again?

01:41:00.496 --> 01:41:02.919
No, I think I can manage. Thanks a lot.

01:41:11.924 --> 01:41:13.451
Harold.

01:41:13.551 --> 01:41:15.553
How unexpected.

01:42:21.369 --> 01:42:23.041
Harold, call it off!

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:27.775
You can't do it.
You can't deal with these people.

01:42:27.875 --> 01:42:29.569
For Christ's sake,
they're not interested in money.

01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:32.092
They're political, they're fanatics!

01:42:32.296 --> 01:42:34.264
Come on, George.

01:42:47.103 --> 01:42:49.025
Come in.

01:42:53.859 --> 01:42:56.612
O'Flaherty, Harold Shand.

01:42:58.114 --> 01:43:00.742
There's 60 grand here.

01:43:01.826 --> 01:43:03.269
To make sure there's no more aggro.

01:43:03.369 --> 01:43:06.022
We'll have to wait
and see the boss about that.

01:43:06.122 --> 01:43:07.315
Where is he?

01:43:07.415 --> 01:43:10.443
He's out there.
He just won the last race.

01:43:10.543 --> 01:43:11.986
He'll be back in a minute.

01:44:36.629 --> 01:44:38.823
This is Mr. Shand.

01:44:38.923 --> 01:44:42.017
He's brought the money
and he wants an answer.

01:44:45.054 --> 01:44:48.899
- How much is that?
- 60 grand, it's in the case.

01:44:49.392 --> 01:44:51.360
You'd better count it.

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:55.196
If you don't mind, I will.

01:46:11.056 --> 01:46:14.526
You wait here. I'll go and get 'em.
All right? I won't be a minute.

01:46:18.355 --> 01:46:20.823
Mr. Restivo, please.

01:46:36.332 --> 01:46:38.175
Where's Charlie?

01:46:39.585 --> 01:46:41.612
Everything's alright.

01:46:41.712 --> 01:46:44.240
All the troubles are over.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:46.217
What did he say?

01:46:47.343 --> 01:46:49.078
Sorry, Harold.

01:46:49.178 --> 01:46:53.182
But I'm glad you dropped in
to say goodbye. That's real nice.

01:46:53.516 --> 01:46:55.668
- What, are you leaving?
- Yeah.

01:46:55.768 --> 01:46:58.896
- You're not going back to New York?
- Next flight out.

01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:01.632
'Ere, come on, Charlie!

01:47:01.732 --> 01:47:05.052
I know we've had a few problems,
but you've only been here a couple of days.

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:07.221
Yeah, a couple of days
that turned out to be

01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:09.744
another St. Valentine's Massacre.

01:47:10.115 --> 01:47:13.334
But that settled it, once and for all.

01:47:14.411 --> 01:47:17.898
Yes, I'd like a porter
to suite 513 please,

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.900
and we'd like a cab right away.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.922
Thank you.

01:47:22.503 --> 01:47:24.947
You two can't wait
to get out of here, can you?

01:47:25.047 --> 01:47:29.142
I always react like that to bombs
blowing up, mass murders...

01:47:29.343 --> 01:47:31.220
It's a hang-up of mine.

01:47:32.513 --> 01:47:36.542
It's coming to something when the Mafia
can't handle a little problem, innit?

01:47:36.642 --> 01:47:38.169
A little problem?

01:47:38.269 --> 01:47:40.817
Tony did you hear what he said?
A little problem...

01:47:40.938 --> 01:47:44.008
Harold, this is like
a bad night in Vietnam.

01:47:44.108 --> 01:47:46.802
But it's over,
I've pulled the plug on 'em.

01:47:46.902 --> 01:47:49.700
We do not deal with gangsters, period.

01:47:50.155 --> 01:47:52.532
This country is a worse risk
than Cuba was.

01:47:53.117 --> 01:47:56.370
It's a banana republic. You're a mess.

01:47:57.162 --> 01:47:58.914
Ciao, Harold.

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:03.547
Bon voyage, then.

01:48:11.385 --> 01:48:13.228
I'll tell you something...

01:48:15.681 --> 01:48:18.000
I'm glad I found out in time
just what a partnership

01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:20.523
with a pair of wankers like you
would've been.

01:48:21.061 --> 01:48:24.110
A sleeping partner's one thing,
but you're in a fucking coma!

01:48:24.523 --> 01:48:27.927
No wonder you got an energy crisis
your side of the water!

01:48:28.027 --> 01:48:32.807
But us British, we're used to
a bit more vitality, imagination,

01:48:32.907 --> 01:48:35.455
touch of the Dunkirk spirit,
know what I mean?

01:48:37.453 --> 01:48:39.730
The days when Yanks could come over here

01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:41.690
and buy up Nelson's Column,

01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:45.694
a Harley street surgeon and a couple
of Windmill Girls are definitely over!

01:48:45.794 --> 01:48:46.946
Now look...

01:48:47.046 --> 01:48:50.140
Shut up, you long streak
of paralysed piss.

01:48:52.843 --> 01:48:56.768
What I'm looking for is someone
who can contribute

01:48:57.723 --> 01:49:00.876
to what England has given to the world:

01:49:00.976 --> 01:49:04.547
culture, sophistication, genius.

01:49:04.647 --> 01:49:08.367
A little bit more than an 'ot dog,
know what I mean?

01:49:09.985 --> 01:49:14.365
We're in the Common Market now,
and my new deal is with Europe,

01:49:15.407 --> 01:49:20.646
I'm going into partnership with a German
organisation. Yeah! The Krauts!

01:49:20.746 --> 01:49:26.002
They've got ambition, know-how,
and they don't lose their bottle.

01:49:27.294 --> 01:49:29.341
Look at you...

01:49:30.005 --> 01:49:31.927
The Mafia?

01:49:32.216 --> 01:49:34.343
I've shit 'em.

01:50:01.662 --> 01:50:03.709
Here, hold up, where's Victoria?

01:50:04.305 --> 01:50:10.324
