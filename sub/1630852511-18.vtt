We're just all about

09:17.491 --> 09:19.190
By the way, she probably is
pissed at him, obviously.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.426
He's, like, talking to,

ruminating.

09:27.467 --> 09:31.403
- That's gonna blow up.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.204

and told the girls

09:33.307 --> 09:34.773
I leaked the wedding speech.

he's telling people.

The fact that they actually
believe what he's saying,

09:43.650 --> 09:44.983
it's so ridiculous.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.351
It makes no sense.

This is the most vulnerable
part and time of my life

their support, I don't.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.726

09:54.795 --> 09:55.927

the wedding speech.

09:55.996 --> 09:56.962
I don't give a [bleep].

wearing thin,

22:19.539 --> 22:20.805

22:20.873 --> 22:24.308
- Speeches are definitely
a touchy topic when

[cheers and applause]

24:01.607 --> 24:04.241
<i> [inspirational music]</i>

24:04.310 --> 24:08.479
- I have been with KultureCity
for over three years.

24:08.548 --> 24:12.082
And this is actually my
first speech with KultureCity

24:12.185 --> 24:14.485
because if you
know me, you know

24:14.554 --> 24:19.957
that I am petrified and awful
at speeches, so here we are.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.259
A few years ago,
my son Greyson and I

24:22.328 --> 24:27.131
were departing Orlando airport
after his autism diagnosis.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.233
While waiting for
a delayed flight,

24:29.302 --> 24:34.238
Greyson could no longer
handle the sensory overload.

24:34.307 --> 24:35.906
It was just too much for him.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.675
I didn't understand what
he was going through.

24:37.743 --> 24:42.313
I didn't understand sensory
overload, sensory needs.

24:42.381 --> 24:46.183
And the worst part
of our experience

24:46.252 --> 24:50.020
was the fact that the airline
airport and the people

24:50.089 --> 24:52.156
surrounding us didn't help.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.893
They kind of just stood there
and watched and most likely

24:55.962 --> 24:57.795
thought that I was
just a bad mother

24:57.864 --> 25:01.365
and I couldn't control
my two-year-old son

25:01.434 --> 25:03.868
when obviously
that wasn't the case.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.404
At KultureCity, we create
sensory accessibility

25:07.473 --> 25:10.374
and inclusion for those
with invisible disabilities.

25:10.443 --> 25:14.411
My goal at KultureCity
is to make every airport

25:14.480 --> 25:17.915
sensory inclusive
certified so no family goes

25:17.984 --> 25:19.049
through what I went through.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.352
By telling Greyson's
story, Greyson

25:21.420 --> 25:23.554
has become a hero to so many.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.256
His journey helps
other families

25:25.324 --> 25:27.625
know there are people
like myself fighting

25:27.693 --> 25:29.760
to make the limits limitless.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.795
Without getting
too emotional,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.964
I wouldn't to know where I
would be without the help

25:34.033 --> 25:36.734
and support from KultureCity.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.569
Hi.

25:38.638 --> 25:39.603
Oh.

25:44.010 --> 25:50.314

Mommy is so proud of you.

at Casa di Amore.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.236
- What a stalker.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.771
- He said, make sure
to get the steak,

27:53.839 --> 27:55.406
fried ravioli,
prosciutto,

27:55.474 --> 27:56.974
Caesar salad,

27:57.043 --> 27:57.975
- Come on.

27:58.044 --> 27:59.143
We can't order like that.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.344
I'm on the stripper diet.

28:00.413 --> 28:02.913
- Mike probably has
crazy FOMO that me

28:02.982 --> 28:04.448

28:04.517 --> 28:08.819
I mean, Mike loves food so
much that he's ordering my meal

28:08.888 --> 28:10.354

28:10.423 --> 28:13.490

I think Angelina's
going to give it to him.

- I know.
- She's not going to hold back.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.395

feel betrayed.

28:20.466 --> 28:21.732

because those guys

28:23.436 --> 28:24.368
came to him.

28:24.437 --> 28:25.736
- Yeah.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.571
- And I guess he could have
just said, like, nah,

28:27.640 --> 28:28.906
I'm not touching that,
whatever.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.641

guy, like,

28:32.478 --> 28:33.977
That's the messenger
right there.

28:34.046 --> 28:34.978
Did he have to tell us?

28:35.047 --> 28:36.013
Of course he did.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.581
He tells us everything.
- Right.

28:37.650 --> 28:40.317
It's like giving information
to the press, you know?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.186
Like, you know he's going
to blast it out there.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.554

<i> Tonight Mike's come over.</i>

30:45.611 --> 30:49.146
But first, I am actually going
to have a lunch with Deena

30:49.215 --> 30:52.015
and Nicole for the first
time since they brought

30:52.084 --> 30:54.151
our [bleep] onto social media.

30:54.220 --> 30:55.752
Bye, Peanut.

30:55.821 --> 30:59.523
<i> - ♪ I'll be</i>
<i> the last one standing ♪</i>

30:59.592 --> 31:00.791
<i> ♪ Today is my day ♪</i>
- How are you?

31:00.860 --> 31:02.092
- I'm all right.

31:02.161 --> 31:05.028
<i> - ♪ I'll be</i>
<i> the last one standing ♪</i>

31:05.097 --> 31:06.463
- Where's my drank?

31:06.532 --> 31:09.600
<i> [upbeat music]</i>

31:09.668 --> 31:13.136
- OK.

31:13.205 --> 31:15.272
<i> Walking into this lunch,</i>
<i> I am very angry.</i>

31:15.341 --> 31:16.840
- I hope she's
not coming in hot.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.910
- Like, I want to hear, like,
what do they know about Chris?

31:19.979 --> 31:21.478
What did he say?

31:21.547 --> 31:23.513
<i> And why did they put all</i>
<i> of our [bleep] on social media</i>

31:23.582 --> 31:25.816
when we all promised each
other we wouldn't bring

31:25.885 --> 31:27.017
[bleep] to social media
anymore?

31:27.086 --> 31:29.052
And here we are.

31:29.121 --> 31:31.054
- Oh, god.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.256
- What the [bleep] is this?

31:32.324 --> 31:34.157
- I did believe you
did leak the speech.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.894
- Mike is getting
us all stirred up.

31:36.962 --> 31:38.962
- You don't know what the
[bleep] I'm going through.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.832
- I want to run away.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.369
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

31:45.437 --> 31:46.837
- So much for not
drinking today.

31:46.906 --> 31:49.306
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.441
- Cheers.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.677
- Oh god.

31:53.746 --> 31:54.778
- Hi.

31:54.847 --> 31:56.146
My voice is a little bad.
- Oh, hey.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.547
- Are you sick?
- No.

31:57.616 --> 31:58.982
- OK.

31:59.051 --> 32:01.919
- I have, like, allergies
really bad, so don't mind it.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.120
- You sound like an old lady.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.922
You sound terrible.
- Did you walk here?

32:04.990 --> 32:06.390
- No.
- Do you want a martini?

32:06.458 --> 32:07.658
- I need something.

32:07.726 --> 32:10.427
- I haven't talked to
Ang since, obviously,

32:10.496 --> 32:12.629
after everything went down.

32:12.698 --> 32:13.830
- So...

32:13.899 --> 32:14.865
<i> - And obviously,</i>
<i> you know, there's</i>

32:14.934 --> 32:16.199
an elephant in the room.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.436
We have to talk, but I
feel like Angelina's nose

32:19.505 --> 32:21.538
looks great.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.607
- Like, I'm just
going to get to it.

32:23.676 --> 32:24.808
Why are you guys mad?

32:24.877 --> 32:27.144
I just wanted to know.

32:27.212 --> 32:32.316
- So, as you know, Mike had
talked to Chris or whatever.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.151
I'm sure you know about that.

32:34.219 --> 32:38.789
Then we heard Chris say he has
receipts that you were the one

32:38.857 --> 32:40.457
that leaked the speech.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.092
- Yeah, so when we heard all
the stuff from Mike,

32:42.161 --> 32:43.694
it brought up a
lot of emotions.

32:43.762 --> 32:46.330
And then we see all
these articles happening.

32:46.398 --> 32:48.665
<i> I was a little upset with</i>
<i> you, and I was more hurt,</i>

32:48.734 --> 32:49.967
<i> I think.</i>

32:50.035 --> 32:51.301
So we did the tweet,
and I was like,

32:51.370 --> 32:52.402
why am I even tweeting this?

32:52.471 --> 32:54.004
- I was blindsided.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.173
My Twitter is going off,
and I'm like,

32:56.241 --> 32:57.574
what the [bleep] is this?

32:57.643 --> 33:00.110
<i> These tweets from the</i>
<i> meatballs and Jenni,</i>

33:00.179 --> 33:01.578
they were very hurtful to me.

33:01.647 --> 33:02.746
How come you guys
didn't text me,

33:02.815 --> 33:04.681
hey, like, Chris is
telling Mike that,

33:04.750 --> 33:05.682
like, you leaked the speech?

33:05.751 --> 33:06.917
Is it [bleep] true?

33:06.986 --> 33:08.852
- You know, Mike kind of
got us a little riled up.

33:08.921 --> 33:10.320
- I'm very hurt
that the meatballs--

33:10.389 --> 33:12.522
and Jenni is included also--

33:12.591 --> 33:15.926
that they would actually go
ahead and just believe Chris.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.227
No call to me.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.595
<i> No text to me.</i>

33:18.664 --> 33:20.464
<i> I mean, we are going</i>
<i> through a messy divorce.</i>

33:20.532 --> 33:22.966
Why would you believe
somebody you hardly even know?

33:23.035 --> 33:24.434
- Like, I'm sitting
here dealing

33:24.503 --> 33:26.403
with this [bleep] kid
that's, like, literally

33:26.472 --> 33:27.838
telling you guys [bleep].

33:27.906 --> 33:30.107
And then you got Mike over
here, taking the bait.

33:30.175 --> 33:32.242
Chris is giving him the
bait, and he's taking it.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.810
- We just believed the speech.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.445
- I did believe you
did leak the speech.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.513
- Yeah.
- Why?

33:36.582 --> 33:37.514
- I don't know.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.815
Because you hated us.

33:38.884 --> 33:39.850
- Yeah.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.051
You said, I get the last laugh.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.219
- You being mad is
not hurting them.

33:42.287 --> 33:43.220
It's hurting you.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.788
- I will get the last laugh.

33:44.857 --> 33:47.591
- But again, like, nobody came
to me, which I'm upset about.

33:47.659 --> 33:48.592
I'm like, come on.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.227
We had the Dr. Drew [bleep].

33:50.295 --> 33:52.529
- You're trying to deal with
this social media thing.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.664
- If I say that I'm never
going to go on social media,

33:54.733 --> 33:56.566
I want the same respect.
- What do you think?

33:56.635 --> 33:57.901
- No, I won't take
it to social media.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.436
I'm never going to
be the one that's,

33:59.505 --> 34:03.607
like, the first one on social
media to disrespect somebody.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.075
- We're sorry that
that happened.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.276
- Yeah.
We should not have tweeted.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.711
That was really immature of us.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.646
Like, I take full
responsibility for that.

34:09.715 --> 34:10.981
It should have been
like, did you really

34:11.050 --> 34:12.282
[bleep] leak the speech?
- Yeah.

34:12.351 --> 34:13.617
I would have [bleep]
looked at that text

34:13.685 --> 34:15.118
and been like, [bleep] that.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.453
No, I didn't [bleep] leak it.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.754
And that would have been it.

34:17.823 --> 34:20.190
- I know in my heart
of hearts that Angelina

34:20.259 --> 34:23.260
was so upset at us that
she leaked the speech.

34:23.328 --> 34:24.694
<i> I would love for</i>
<i> her to admit it,</i>

34:24.763 --> 34:26.496
<i> but you know, girl,</i>
<i> it is what it is.</i>

34:26.565 --> 34:28.532
Like, Ang, I'm sorry
I tweeted that,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.333
but, like,
let's just all move on

34:30.436 --> 34:32.002
and never talk
about this again.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.504
- We handled it,
like we said, the wrong way.

34:34.573 --> 34:37.941
And we regret it, and,
you know, moving forward,

34:38.010 --> 34:40.677
it's not-- we're not
going to go to Twitter.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.045
Sorry, girl.
- Yeah.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.680
- We were babies.

34:43.749 --> 34:47.250
- I actually did not expect the
meatballs to apologize to me,

34:47.319 --> 34:50.253
and I'm happy that they,
you know, said sorry to me.

34:50.322 --> 34:51.254
I deserved a sorry.

34:51.323 --> 34:52.255
I'm sorry.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.658
I'm sorry that I
deserved a sorry.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.126
- We shouldn't have did that.
- I know.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.260
- I was like, yeah,
we are stupid.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.528
- Why would we do that?

34:58.597 --> 34:59.796
- Did Jenni tell you guys
to tweet that, like,

34:59.865 --> 35:02.165
let's all tweet it?

35:02.234 --> 35:03.900
- No.
- Nicole.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.335
- Stop looking at me.
- I know.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.536
- Why are you looking at me?

35:06.605 --> 35:07.604
- I know Jenni told
you guys to do it.

35:07.673 --> 35:09.072
- No, she didn't.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.942
- There's been many, many,
many situations that the girls

35:12.010 --> 35:14.077
have actually said,
Jenni had no involvement

35:14.146 --> 35:15.579
in this situation.
No.

35:15.647 --> 35:17.047
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:17.116 --> 35:20.050
And then come to find out,
Jenni actually has

35:20.119 --> 35:21.785
had part in those situations.

35:21.854 --> 35:23.120
<i> So you know, it's very</i>
<i> hard to trust her.</i>

35:23.188 --> 35:24.221
<i> I've got to tell you.</i>

35:24.289 --> 35:25.422
You got to understand, like,
why

35:25.491 --> 35:28.992
I thought that because
there's that text.

35:29.061 --> 35:30.026
- Yeah.

35:30.095 --> 35:31.261
- I feel bad for Chris.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.462
- He might be there,
and he might

35:32.531 --> 35:33.964
be the one that's taking
the [bleep] picture,

35:34.032 --> 35:35.499
for all I know.

35:35.567 --> 35:38.702
- I just asked Chris
if he's in Mexico.

35:38.770 --> 35:43.673
- Zack texted to Chris and
said, how's Mexico, bro?

35:43.742 --> 35:46.176
And he knew Chris
wasn't in Mexico.

35:46.245 --> 35:47.911
Why would you do that?

35:47.980 --> 35:48.979
- I think this
is a conversation

35:49.047 --> 35:50.180
you have to have with her.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.715
- I am,
but I'm explaining to you guys

35:51.783 --> 35:52.816
what I'm going to say.

35:52.885 --> 35:55.051
Mike is a whole nother beast.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.388
Mike was on Twitter, full
force, like, let's do it.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.422
Like, what dirt you got on her?

35:59.525 --> 36:00.624
- We didn't know that.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.058
- What receipts you got on her?
Oh no.

36:02.127 --> 36:03.593
I got all the [bleep]
receipts in my phone.

36:03.662 --> 36:04.728
- Can I see his messages?

36:04.796 --> 36:05.829
- Yeah.

36:05.898 --> 36:08.198
- I just want to see
what's happening.

36:08.267 --> 36:09.266
- "Tell me more."

36:09.334 --> 36:10.500
- That's weird.

36:10.569 --> 36:13.203
- I don't know how
Chris and Mike spoke.

36:13.272 --> 36:14.538
I don't know how
that came about.

36:14.606 --> 36:15.772
- He must have reached out
because I don't think

36:15.841 --> 36:17.841
Mike reached out.
- Oh, let me show you that.

36:17.910 --> 36:20.343
On Twitter, Mike's,
like, making appointments

36:20.412 --> 36:22.112
to, like, talk to Chris.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.980
Chris, call me back
at, like, 3:30.

36:24.049 --> 36:25.182
- See, that I don't know.

36:25.250 --> 36:26.516
- Yeah, we didn't know that.

36:26.585 --> 36:27.951
- I just feel like,
you know, everybody should

36:28.020 --> 36:30.120
just stay in their lane.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.288
- You have all the receipts.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.989
I mean, he wasn't
trying to hide it.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.425
- But Mike has been
swerving all over the road.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.661
Mike has not been
staying in his lane.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.963
- Then there's more.

36:40.032 --> 36:42.899
- "So you can DM and we
can start this party."

36:42.968 --> 36:44.401
- Let's start this party?

36:44.469 --> 36:45.869
- I need another drink.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.672
- He knows that he stirred
this whole [bleep] thing up.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.840
- [sighs]

36:54.213 --> 36:56.346
<i> [upbeat funky music]</i>

36:56.415 --> 36:58.348
- Mike is a whole nother beast.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.251
He knows that he stirred
this whole [bleep] thing up.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.619
- I'm like, what is happening?

37:02.688 --> 37:04.854
Mike just went crazy
with this whole thing.

37:04.923 --> 37:05.855
<i> And he got messy.</i>

37:05.924 --> 37:07.123
<i> And he got too deep.</i>

37:07.226 --> 37:08.892
It just-- it doesn't
make sense to me.

37:08.961 --> 37:11.194
- Why are you
calling it a party?

37:11.263 --> 37:13.296
You don't know what the
[bleep] I'm going through.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.065
I don't care if you think
I cheated on my husband

37:15.133 --> 37:16.533
with [bleep] 25 guys.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.401
That does not
give you the right

37:18.470 --> 37:21.771
to call this-- to let this
kid call you, you call him,

37:21.840 --> 37:23.940
and you guys shoot the [bleep],
and you're, like, best friends

37:24.009 --> 37:25.709
with him and you're
listening to every [bleep]

37:25.777 --> 37:27.644
little God-given
word he's giving you?

37:27.713 --> 37:29.412
- Wow, so this is getting
really messy, huh?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.114
- It's getting grimy.
- It's going to be messy.

37:41.760 --> 37:46.630
- What are you doing?

37:46.698 --> 37:47.998
- Oh, all right.

37:48.066 --> 37:49.566
I'm going over to Angeliners'.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.903
She wants to sit down and--

37:53.972 --> 37:55.472
- You know what?

37:55.540 --> 37:57.974
There is a lot of drama, and
you don't refuse to sit-down.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.143
- So this sit-down
needs to happen.

38:00.212 --> 38:01.378
Am I excited about it?

38:01.446 --> 38:04.147
Not so much because
I know her nickname

38:04.216 --> 38:05.915
is Hurricane Angeliners.

38:05.984 --> 38:09.386
And I know right now her
life is extremely messy.

38:09.454 --> 38:10.587
- Wish me luck, honey.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.522
I'm going in raw dog.

38:12.591 --> 38:13.623
- I love you.
Bye.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.624
<i> - Bye.</i>

38:14.693 --> 38:15.825
- Have you spoke to Mike?

38:15.894 --> 38:17.193
- Yeah.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.296
He's telling me, oh, I
have no problems with you.

38:19.364 --> 38:21.164
And then I messaged Lauren.

38:21.233 --> 38:24.868
And Lauren's like, it's
not our fault that people

38:24.936 --> 38:26.102
come to us with this.

38:26.171 --> 38:30.106
That's his whole MO.
"I didn't do anything.

38:30.175 --> 38:31.675
People come to me
with these things."

38:31.743 --> 38:33.576
- But I think Chris
reached out to Mike.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.111
- It doesn't matter
who reached--

38:35.180 --> 38:38.214
like, the fact that, like, he's
taking phone calls from him,

38:38.283 --> 38:41.484
and he's literally, like,
spewing it out to you guys

38:41.553 --> 38:43.453
and, like, riling you guys up.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.587
- We're always in the middle.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.891
- Is Mike, The Situation,
a changed man?

38:47.959 --> 38:49.125
I don't know anymore.

38:49.194 --> 38:50.660
<i> - You know, we make jokes.</i>

38:50.729 --> 38:52.362
There's old Mike and new Mike.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.931
<i> And this pot that Mike has</i>
<i> stirred up is, like, huge.</i>

38:55.000 --> 38:57.934
Like, yo, stop stirring it
so fast, Mike.

38:58.003 --> 38:58.968
Relax.
- He is backtracking.

38:59.037 --> 39:00.970
- Why? What's happening?
- Why?

39:01.039 --> 39:03.506
- Because he's trying
to text me now,

39:03.575 --> 39:07.377
tell me he sent me
Lauren's skincare launch.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.446
- I'm gonna do a
skincare launch party.

39:09.514 --> 39:10.513
- OK.

39:10.582 --> 39:12.215
- But since Angelina
blocked me--

39:12.284 --> 39:13.516
- Yeah.

39:13.585 --> 39:15.685
- --should I invite
someone who blocked me?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.587
- Just send the
invite as a gesture.

39:17.656 --> 39:18.922
She doesn't have to accept it.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.357
She doesn't have to come.

39:20.425 --> 39:21.358
- Are you going?

39:21.426 --> 39:22.959
- I don't know.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.327
I don't know.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.397
I'm like, you really want
me to go to that, like,

39:27.466 --> 39:28.398
doesn't your wife not like me?

39:28.467 --> 39:29.632
He's like, no.

39:29.701 --> 39:30.867
- I'm so confused.

39:30.936 --> 39:33.069
- He always likes my
pictures on Instagram.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.704
It'll be, like,
me sitting there,

39:34.773 --> 39:36.406
and he'll, like, put,
like, heart face--

39:36.475 --> 39:39.376
heart eye emojis.

39:39.444 --> 39:41.077
Look at this picture of me.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.579
- Why is he sending
those emojis?

39:42.647 --> 39:45.081
- This is weird because it's
like, you know, in group chat,

39:45.150 --> 39:47.817
like, Mike will show us,
like, everything he's talked

39:47.886 --> 39:50.520
about with the exes
and say how messy

39:50.589 --> 39:54.524
her life is and, like, she's
cheating, and she's wrong.

39:54.593 --> 39:57.193
- Why is he [bleep] heart
eyes emojing my [bleep]--

39:57.262 --> 39:59.262
- Well, we didn't know
you guys were speaking.

39:59.331 --> 40:03.099
- But how can you also be
liking all of her pictures

40:03.168 --> 40:05.935
and inviting Angelina
to the skincare launch

40:06.004 --> 40:08.905
and then talk so
badly about her?

40:08.974 --> 40:10.874
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.977
- He needs to learn that he
can't [bleep] do this anymore.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.945
He's a [bleep] gaslighter.

40:16.014 --> 40:17.947
He's trying to do
"Matrix" [bleep], and it's

40:18.016 --> 40:19.282
not happening no more.

40:19.351 --> 40:20.517
- Listen,
we're staying out of this.

40:20.585 --> 40:21.885
- And Jenni too.

40:21.953 --> 40:25.121
- Mike is sitting here,
getting us all stirred up.

40:25.190 --> 40:26.356
- I want to run away.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.158
- And he's the one
that did all of this.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.094
- This is too messy.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.262
This is a dumpster fire.

40:32.330 --> 40:33.496
I'm sending it to
the squad right

40:33.565 --> 40:35.532
now because I am shooketh.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.768
- Like, he literally
opened this can of worms,

40:38.837 --> 40:41.371
and now he's trying to
shut it, but the worms

40:41.473 --> 40:42.372
are just coming out, Mike.

40:42.474 --> 40:44.040
- How can I ever
trust Mike again?

40:44.109 --> 40:46.242
- You're going to have to
have a conversation with him

40:46.311 --> 40:47.577
about that.
- He's got to stop.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.879
Mike doesn't respect me,
but today,

40:49.948 --> 40:51.214
I'm going to make
sure he respects me

40:51.283 --> 40:54.117
because I'm [bleep] done.

40:54.186 --> 40:55.785
- [groans]

40:58.390 --> 40:59.355
- You need to [bleep] stop
getting involved

40:59.424 --> 41:00.523
in people's lives.
- Let's be real.

41:00.592 --> 41:02.091
You had multiple side pieces.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.660
And then you're
mad at everybody

41:03.728 --> 41:05.161
for finding out
that you're [bleep]

41:05.263 --> 41:06.162
cheating with everybody.

41:06.264 --> 41:07.397
- [bleep] all of you then.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.232
- I need to take a
step back because it's

41:09.301 --> 41:10.700
affecting my whole life.

41:10.769 --> 41:11.868
It's not worth it.

41:11.937 --> 41:13.269
- What are you,
[bleep] delusional?

41:13.338 --> 41:15.338
[all screaming]

41:15.407 --> 41:16.906
- It's too much.
