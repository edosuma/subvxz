WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:05.439
Ugly... cheesy...

00:05.439 --> 00:08.075
That is <i>so</i> last year.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.410
Stupid pet catalog.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.546
Five bucks for
a squeaker mouse

00:12.546 --> 00:14.815
and it's not even
a good faux fur.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.984
These people don't know
diddly about cats.

00:16.984 --> 00:18.418
Do they have a section
on muzzles?

00:18.418 --> 00:21.688
No. Why would a cat need a...

00:21.688 --> 00:22.456
( <i>chuckles</i> )

00:22.456 --> 00:23.924
Aren't you the witty one.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.827
( <i>phone rings</i> )

00:27.661 --> 00:29.830
Hello?

00:29.830 --> 00:32.766
Oh, Hilda, that is so juicy.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.234
I understand--
you're sequestered

00:34.234 --> 00:35.702
and you can't discuss the case.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.804
Call me the minute you break.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.841
First day on other
realm jury duty

00:40.841 --> 00:43.176
and Hilda's
already on trial,
and it's a biggy.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.612
Is it that shady ring
of magic carpet cleaners?

00:45.612 --> 00:48.448
No. The defendant is
the other realm's biggest

00:48.448 --> 00:51.385
and sleaziest supplier
of black market hot tubs.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.853
Lou Packard.

00:52.853 --> 00:53.854
You know him?

00:53.854 --> 00:55.355
We've broken bread.

00:55.355 --> 00:58.025
Lou taught me all about
the world of commerce

00:58.025 --> 00:59.493
how to move merchandise.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.228
Wait a minute.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.431
You two were actually
in business together?

01:04.431 --> 01:07.301
If Thailand
could talk.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.502
I'll tell
you something

01:08.502 --> 01:09.503
if Lou's convicted

01:09.503 --> 01:10.771
and turned
into a feline

01:10.771 --> 01:12.706
he'll be appalled
by the outerwear

01:12.706 --> 01:13.707
in this catalog.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.243
I mean, what cat
with any self-respect

01:16.243 --> 01:18.512
would be caught dead
wearing this?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.180
( <i>chuckles</i> )

01:20.180 --> 01:21.782
The joke's on you.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.785
I said a cat <i>with</i>
self-respect.

01:27.988 --> 01:34.094
♪ Life's changing around me,
and I'm gonna make it mine ♪

01:34.094 --> 01:40.400
♪ I'm reaching out

01:40.400 --> 01:43.804
♪ Time's moving way too fast ♪

01:53.447 --> 01:59.152

02:11.898 --> 02:12.933
I knew we should have
shoved our way

02:12.933 --> 02:13.900
up to the front.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.202
Why? He's handing
out English papers

02:15.202 --> 02:17.371
not Macy Gray
tickets.
-Exactly.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.672
I kicked butt
on that paper.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.874
I want to collect my "A"
and slide into the weekend

02:20.874 --> 02:23.076
basking in the afterglow
of a job well done.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.645
Beats my weekend plans:

02:24.645 --> 02:26.847
helping my mother
pick out her new
toilet seat

02:26.847 --> 02:28.782
and recovering from the
"F" I'm about to get.

02:28.782 --> 02:29.983
You really think
you failed?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.385
No, but this way
if I did

02:31.385 --> 02:33.153
I won't be
disappointed.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.122
I'm going shopping
this weekend, too.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.224
The Apocalypse Fest
and Parking Lot Sale.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.393
Killer deals.
Everything is priced to move.

02:39.393 --> 02:42.295
Miles, you're up.
Look alive.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.432
Professor Carlin, I don't mean
to lay a guilt trip on you

02:45.432 --> 02:47.134
but a bad grade could put

02:47.134 --> 02:50.370
a dark cloud over
my entire apocalypse weekend.

02:50.370 --> 02:51.838
Bring me back a hat?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.774
I always do, sir.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.509
Professor Carlin,
I just want to say

02:55.509 --> 02:56.576
what a pleasure it is

02:56.576 --> 02:58.545
to explore American
literature with you.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.514
I mean,
as Mark Twain once said...

03:00.514 --> 03:02.382
This bites the big one!

03:02.382 --> 03:04.718
Ah, yes-- Becky Thatcher
in <i>Tom Sawyer.</i>

03:04.718 --> 03:07.988
She was a real potty mouth.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.358
Sabrina, are you all right?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.559
No, I'm not all right.

03:12.559 --> 03:15.262
I got a "C"! A "C"!

03:15.262 --> 03:22.402
( <i>dramatic music playing</i> )

03:22.402 --> 03:24.071
Big deal.
You got a "C."

03:24.071 --> 03:25.205
It's not like
it's the first one

03:25.205 --> 03:26.873
you've ever gotten.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.974
Oh, my God, it is.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.744
Roxie, this paper is my future.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.079
Getting a "C" is like being told

03:32.079 --> 03:34.347
"Nice try. Now go hose down
the Slurpee machine."

03:34.347 --> 03:36.383
Hey, I got a "C,"
and I have no intention

03:36.383 --> 03:38.685
of hawking big gulps
for the rest of my life.

03:38.685 --> 03:39.286
I got a "D"

03:39.286 --> 03:42.422
and a... giant
question mark.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.423
I'm sorry, guys.

03:43.423 --> 03:45.025
You know how I am
about my grades.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.259
-Psycho.
-Psycho.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.161
Hey, I worked really hard
on this paper.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.963
I just don't get
what the problem is.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.164
The problem is Carlin.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.999
He doesn't want to spoil
his reputation

03:52.999 --> 03:54.534
as the toughest teacher
at Adams.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.803
Not to mention
he's a pawn of
the establishment.

03:56.803 --> 03:58.705
No connection between
<i>Huckleberry Finn</i>

03:58.705 --> 04:01.441
and the rise of the
military-industrial
complex? Please.

04:01.441 --> 04:04.311
Mystery solved about <i>his</i> grade.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.880
You're going to obsess
about this, aren't you?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.749
No. Obsessing is
what Miles does.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.083
I prefer confrontation.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.551
You hate confrontation.

04:11.551 --> 04:12.652
Good point.

04:12.652 --> 04:15.388
Would you go ask Carlin
why he gave me a "C"?

04:15.388 --> 04:18.024
Fine. I'll do it,
but you owe me.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.601
Professor Carlin?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.202
Oh, hello, Sabrina.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.971
I don't mean to
be disrespectful
or anything

04:30.971 --> 04:32.839
but I just wanted to talk to you
about the grade you gave me

04:32.839 --> 04:33.707
on the <i>Huck Finn</i> paper.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.309
I think it is bogus
and totally ridiculous.

04:36.309 --> 04:37.911
Well, I like students
who aren't afraid

04:37.911 --> 04:39.913
to express their opinion.
Keep up the good work.

04:39.913 --> 04:42.082
Professor Carlin, it was
a well-constructed essay.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.316
My footnotes were awesome.

04:43.316 --> 04:44.584
I triple-checked for typos.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.253
I even included
that bonus paragraph

04:46.253 --> 04:48.021
"Factoids of
The Mighty Mississippi."

04:48.021 --> 04:51.658
Look, Sabrina, the mechanics
of your paper were good

04:51.658 --> 04:55.362
but your thesis lacked depth,
originality and punch.

04:55.362 --> 04:56.863
It was oozing with punch.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.766
If you want to argue
that <i>Huckleberry Finn</i> is

04:59.766 --> 05:02.669
about hypocrisy in society,
I'm all for that

05:02.669 --> 05:05.071
but you need specifics
to back it up:

05:05.071 --> 05:07.874
how did Huck's upbringing
impact his relationship with Jim

05:07.874 --> 05:08.809
as they rode down the river?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.677
Why did I have to say "river"?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.846
Still, I don't think
I deserved a "C."

05:12.846 --> 05:15.148
Well, just work harder
on your next assignments

05:15.148 --> 05:16.850
and eventually
you'll get that "P."

05:16.850 --> 05:18.785
I mean, "B."

05:18.785 --> 05:21.188
I'm going to try
the third floor.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.691
"B"? I want an "A"!

05:24.691 --> 05:25.826
( <i>banging on door</i> )

05:26.126 --> 05:27.260
( <i>men shouting</i> )

05:27.260 --> 05:28.228
Oops.

05:32.199 --> 05:35.769
Hilda, Lou Packard has swindled
hundreds of gullible women

05:35.769 --> 05:37.671
out of their life savings.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.507
Yes, I'm sure he has
a very nice smile.

05:40.507 --> 05:44.177
No, I will not go to your bank
and make a withdrawal.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.179
Call me later.

05:46.179 --> 05:46.513
I can't believe it.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.482
Hilda is developing a crush
on Lou Packard.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.551
What on earth?

05:52.052 --> 05:54.721
What is all of this?

05:55.488 --> 05:57.724
Salem, what did you do,
rob a Petco?

05:57.724 --> 05:58.892
Petco? Please.

05:58.892 --> 06:03.663
These are all custom-designed
Salem Saberhagen originals.

06:03.663 --> 06:07.100
"Anti-tick shampoo
with jojoba"?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.070
Zellie, witness the rebirth
of animal retail.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.905
My new business...

06:13.373 --> 06:14.975
Cat-opia!

06:14.975 --> 06:15.508
"Furniture, apparel,
cuisine

06:18.044 --> 06:20.614
<i>pour le chat a la mode."</i>

06:20.614 --> 06:23.049
"For the cat
with ice cream on top"?

06:23.049 --> 06:25.886
The gals in accounting
came up with that.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.621
Salem, you can't
open a store.

06:27.621 --> 06:29.756
You're no good
with the general public

06:29.756 --> 06:31.091
and you have no thumbs.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.659
Not a factor,
baby doll.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.262
This is strictly
an Internet operation

06:35.262 --> 06:36.663
catering to the millions

06:36.663 --> 06:38.832
of felines
with discretionary income.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.367
I hate to burst your bubble

06:40.367 --> 06:43.003
but not many cats know
how to work a computer.

06:43.003 --> 06:47.507
Please! Show me a cat
that can't work a mouse.

06:47.507 --> 06:51.311
( <i>chuckles</i> )

06:51.311 --> 06:53.780
I've got a much better vibe
about this paper.

06:53.780 --> 06:55.215
I'm feeling very confident.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.316
Then why did
you chew off

06:56.316 --> 06:57.484
nine of your
fingernails?

06:57.484 --> 06:58.485
I need the fiber.

06:58.485 --> 07:00.186
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

07:00.186 --> 07:02.122
I told you guys
what Professor Carlin said

07:02.122 --> 07:03.523
about supporting
our arguments.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.225
We all worked very hard
on our papers

07:05.225 --> 07:07.594
and I'm sure it'll be reflected
in our grades.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.229
But don't go by me.

07:11.965 --> 07:12.766
I can't believe this.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.867
We did everything
he wanted

07:13.867 --> 07:14.868
and we all got Cs.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.836
This is awesome!
I shot up to average.

07:16.836 --> 07:19.105
In a month,
I could be wrecking the curve.

07:19.873 --> 07:20.974
This is insane.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.610
I mean, I supported
my thesis 25 different ways.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.545
This paper is filthy
with subtext.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.113
Spellman, when are you
going to realize?

07:27.113 --> 07:29.015
it doesn't matter
how hard you work
for Carlin--

07:29.015 --> 07:31.952
"C" is the best grade
anyone ever gets in his class.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.457
Hilda, I don't care
how dreamy Lou's eyes are

07:37.457 --> 07:41.161
love notes don't usually contain
the words "or else."

07:41.161 --> 07:42.829
Oh, honey, I've got to go.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.030
Hi, Sabrina.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.966
How'd you do on your
English paper?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.767
I got a freakin' "C,"
okay?!

07:47.767 --> 07:49.302
You're kidding.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.271
I thought it was
a wonderful paper.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.973
I loved the way
you identified

07:52.973 --> 07:54.908
Hawthorne's symbolic
use of color--

07:54.908 --> 07:57.010
Dimmesdale's
white lofty brow

07:57.010 --> 07:58.578
Chillingworth's
black heart

07:58.578 --> 08:00.814
and Hester Prynne's
scarlet letter.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.649
All leading to Sabrina's
big fat "C."

08:02.649 --> 08:04.884
You know, maybe I'm
just not cut out
for college.

08:04.884 --> 08:06.953
Maybe I should drop out,
join a road crew

08:06.953 --> 08:08.788
and pick up trash
along the highway.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.890
I could meet interesting
felons, work outdoors

08:10.890 --> 08:13.860
plus I'm one of the few people
who looks really good in orange.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.628
Honey, you're not
picking up trash.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.163
You're going
to stay in school

08:17.163 --> 08:18.598
and finish your education.

08:18.598 --> 08:20.166
You know, I used
to love English.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.835
It was always
my favorite language.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.970
But now I don't care
if I read another novel

08:23.970 --> 08:25.038
as long as I live.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.407
Oh, honey, I know
plenty of tough graders

08:27.407 --> 08:28.875
but turning students off

08:28.875 --> 08:32.212
to learning really
cracks my corn.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.347
I'm going to give Professor
Carlin a piece of my mind.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.081
No, please, don't.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.316
Look, I don't want Carlin
singling me out

08:36.316 --> 08:38.118
because I cried to my auntie.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.486
I'm not going in
as your aunt.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.121
I'm going in
as an educator.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.123
I'll be professional
and discrete.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.058
You know how good
I am with people.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.027
Oh, Professor,
so sorry to hear

08:47.027 --> 08:50.263
your wife left you.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.598
She did?

08:55.301 --> 08:57.537
Excuse me.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.304
Are you Professor Carlin?

08:58.304 --> 09:00.573
Yes, I am.

09:00.573 --> 09:04.411
I'm afraid I've already hired
my graduate T.A.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.013
Oh, you thought I was
a graduate...

09:07.013 --> 09:08.248
Aren't you sweet.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.949
That depends on who you ask.

09:09.949 --> 09:10.517
And you would be?

09:10.517 --> 09:13.053
Single... I mean, Zelda.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.421
I mean, Professor
Zelda Spellman.

09:14.421 --> 09:17.057
Hi, Zelda.
I'm Arthur.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.391
It's a pleasure
to finally make
your acquaintance.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.560
-I've been hearing
wonderful things about you.
-Really?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.995
They say the quality
of the science department's

09:21.995 --> 09:24.431
gone up 12 notches
since you came aboard.

09:24.431 --> 09:27.901
Well, I do have
a passion for physics.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.370
I try to use it
to inspire my students.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.638
That's very admirable.

09:31.638 --> 09:34.040
Thank you.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.609
You're welcome.

09:36.609 --> 09:40.480
So, uh, not that
you need a reason

09:40.480 --> 09:42.782
but what brings you here?

09:42.782 --> 09:45.318
Oh, yes. My niece Sabrina.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.054
Ooh, I wasn't supposed
to say that.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.356
Oh, look, just between us,
she's feeling very frustrated

09:50.356 --> 09:51.424
about her
Hawthorne paper

09:51.424 --> 09:53.960
which I read
and thought was quite good.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.896
It was good
but not great.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.531
A great paper
would have explored

09:58.531 --> 09:59.999
Hawthorne's frequent
use of mirrors

09:59.999 --> 10:01.301
to reveal the characters
in her thoughts

10:01.301 --> 10:06.706
and the emotional tension
between them.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.008
I'm surprised that
wasn't obvious to you.

10:09.008 --> 10:11.945
Well, I just skimmed it, really.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.580
But the issue is bigger

10:13.580 --> 10:15.014
than this one paper.

10:15.014 --> 10:17.250
I'm afraid that by being
so tough on your students

10:17.250 --> 10:19.519
you're destroying
their morale.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.188
Zelda, I know I'm not
the world's easiest teacher

10:22.188 --> 10:25.291
but I feel my role
is to raise the bar
and show these kids

10:25.291 --> 10:27.527
that they're capable
of doing better.

10:27.527 --> 10:28.027
That's what's going
to prepare them

10:28.027 --> 10:29.429
for the demands
of the real world.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.029
It's true.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.931
It's very competitive
out there.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.501
Things were so much simpler
when I went to school.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.637
We went to class
during the day,
studied at night

10:37.637 --> 10:40.306
and fought the Ottoman Empire
on the weekends.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.876
Rival football team.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.377
Football fan, are you?

10:44.377 --> 10:48.915
Well, I certainly could be.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.650
So, did you
talk to Carlin?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.752
Oh! We chatted some.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.320
Well, what did he say?

10:54.320 --> 10:56.156
Oh, this and that.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.557
What this? What that?

10:57.557 --> 10:59.058
Well, he said
that if you work harder

10:59.058 --> 11:00.460
you'll get a better grade

11:00.460 --> 11:02.462
and something
about mirrors

11:02.462 --> 11:03.863
that I didn't
quite understand.

11:03.863 --> 11:04.197
That's all you
got out of it

11:04.197 --> 11:05.365
that I should
work harder?

11:05.365 --> 11:07.167
That's the gist of hit.
Got to go.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.401
Whoa, whoa.
I get the feeling

11:08.401 --> 11:10.103
there's something
you're not telling me.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.571
Oh, all right.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.573
Professor Carlin and I
have a date tonight.

11:13.573 --> 11:15.608
A date? You went in there
to bolster student morale

11:15.608 --> 11:17.210
and you came out
dating the enemy?

11:17.210 --> 11:20.180
Sweetheart, he's not
Saddam Hussein.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.381
He's a man
of strong convictions

11:21.381 --> 11:23.583
trying to get the best
out of his students.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.885
I'm convinced that
if you really apply yourself

11:25.885 --> 11:28.254
your hard work will pay off.

11:28.254 --> 11:28.655
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.192
Thanks for nothing,
Aunt Sellout.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.027
This is incredible.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.161
I can't believe
I got an "A"

11:35.161 --> 11:36.153
on the Hemingway paper.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.030
That's the first "A"

11:37.030 --> 11:39.232
Professor Carlin's given out
this decade.

11:39.232 --> 11:39.966
You know,
I didn't believe it

11:39.966 --> 11:40.600
but I guess it's true--

11:40.600 --> 11:42.035
if you really
apply yourself

11:42.035 --> 11:44.204
your hard work
will be rewarded.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.071
So, what time are you
picking me up

11:45.071 --> 11:46.606
for our date tonight?

11:46.606 --> 11:47.273
The sooner the better.

11:47.273 --> 11:49.309
Looks like you're
not the only one

11:49.309 --> 11:51.010
who's applying herself.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.479
What does that mean?

11:53.479 --> 11:54.380
Your aunt's doing
all the work

11:54.380 --> 11:56.950
and you're the one
getting rewarded.

11:56.950 --> 11:59.185
Congratulations
on your "A."

12:11.631 --> 12:13.633
Stop staring at me.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.968
I can't help it.

12:14.968 --> 12:15.501
I never thought

12:15.501 --> 12:16.336
that you would be the one

12:16.336 --> 12:19.339
to rip apart the moral fabric
of academia.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.007
What can I say?
I'm good with my hands.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.376
For the hundredth time

12:23.376 --> 12:24.677
my "A" had nothing to do

12:24.677 --> 12:26.813
with my aunt
dating Professor Carlin.

12:26.813 --> 12:28.982
Miles, would you
just lay off of her?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.450
We should
admire Sabrina.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.718
Thank you, Roxie.

12:31.718 --> 12:33.620
She was just using her wits
and her aunt's body

12:33.620 --> 12:35.488
to get the grade
she couldn't earn on her own.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.656
I did earn it.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.825
That "A" was
a huge accomplishment for me.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.461
Of course-- another milestone
in your insatiable quest

12:41.461 --> 12:43.696
to climb the ladder
of corruption and evil.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.001
Hey, I'm on your side.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.637
Remember me when
you reach the top.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.508
"Through his juxtaposition
of the ravages of war

12:55.508 --> 12:57.010
"to the beauty of the landscape

12:57.010 --> 12:58.778
"Hemingway reveals
his personal code

12:58.778 --> 13:01.114
in a world fraught
with cruelty and suffering."

13:01.114 --> 13:01.648
This is a darn good paper.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.449
I earned that "A."

13:03.449 --> 13:05.318
Or maybe
this is an average paper

13:05.318 --> 13:07.220
and I earned
the eternal contempt

13:07.220 --> 13:08.955
of my friends and classmates.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.323
I need another opinion.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.492
Where am I going to find someone

13:12.492 --> 13:15.461
who's impartial and objective
with a strong ethical sense?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.664
Greetings, little lady.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.500
May I please speak
to the feline of the house?

13:20.500 --> 13:21.834
What are you doing?

13:21.834 --> 13:25.138
Branching out
from the Internet
to direct sales.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.841
I need your opinion
on my new products.

13:30.176 --> 13:31.678
"Saberhagen's Miracle
Worm Elixir?

13:31.678 --> 13:34.213
Eliminates worms, blemishes
and limp-whisker syndrome."

13:34.213 --> 13:35.448
What's in this?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.350
( <i>laughing</i> ):
Like I'd tell <i>you.</i>

13:37.350 --> 13:38.685
Patent Pending.

13:38.685 --> 13:39.786
Salem, I don't have time

13:39.786 --> 13:41.054
for your snake oil
Hucksterism.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.955
I got to figure out
whether I earned that "A"

13:42.955 --> 13:44.657
or if Professor Carlin
just gave it to me

13:44.657 --> 13:45.925
'cause he's dating
Aunt Zelda.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.293
Dating?

13:47.293 --> 13:49.595
For the past week, he's been
chasing her around the house

13:49.595 --> 13:50.630
like an animal in heat.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.465
Speaking of which

13:52.465 --> 13:54.701
can I interest you
in a home spaying kit?

13:54.701 --> 13:55.968
"An animal in heat"?

13:55.968 --> 13:59.238
$12.99, and you get
a full refund

13:59.238 --> 14:01.908
should you inadvertently
have kittens.

14:11.651 --> 14:12.752
Professor Carlin,
do you have a minute?

14:12.752 --> 14:13.986
Uh, maybe later, Sabrina.

14:13.986 --> 14:15.188
I have a class if...

14:15.188 --> 14:17.023
I could just get
this door open.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.124
I'll be quick.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.059
I just wanted to talk
to you about this thing

14:20.059 --> 14:21.160
between you and my aunt.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.864
Ah, yes, the exquisite Zelda.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.665
Hey, you never told me

14:25.665 --> 14:26.699
your aunt was a vision
of loveliness.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.001
Not unlike
the young Lady Chatterley.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.437
Funny, I don't know how
that didn't come up in class.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.172
Listen, can I ask you
about my grade?

14:33.172 --> 14:35.441
You must be quite pleased
about finally getting that "A."

14:35.441 --> 14:36.609
I'm outraged.

14:36.609 --> 14:37.944
It's one thing
to work hard for an "A"

14:37.944 --> 14:39.212
but it's another
to be handed one

14:39.212 --> 14:40.613
you may not deserve
because your aunt

14:40.613 --> 14:41.881
is dating
your English professor.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.316
I don't like what
you're implying.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.084
Okay, maybe you didn't do it
on purpose

14:45.084 --> 14:47.220
but if you were easier on me
than everyone else

14:47.220 --> 14:48.254
that's just not right.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.856
I don't understand--
first you complain

14:49.856 --> 14:51.791
my grades are too hard--
now they're too soft.

14:51.791 --> 14:52.959
I just want what's fair.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.861
I would really like it
if you would reread my essay

14:54.861 --> 14:56.095
and give me the grade I deserve.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.096
All right, fine.

14:57.096 --> 14:58.364
If it will make you happy

14:58.364 --> 15:00.433
I'll take it home
and have a look at it tonight.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.834
What is with the doors
in this building?

15:04.971 --> 15:06.205
Thank you.

15:07.006 --> 15:09.342
No, Hilda,
even if he <i>is</i> proven innocent.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.343
I have no intention

15:10.343 --> 15:12.478
of double-dating in a hot tub

15:12.478 --> 15:15.114
with you,
Lou and his brother Stu.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.116
Oh, what now?

15:17.316 --> 15:20.820
Hey, foxy mama,
what are you doing later?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.588
I knock off at 5:00.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.524
I'm going to knock
you off right now.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.725
Hilda, I've got to go.

15:25.725 --> 15:28.094
Salem, Arthur's going
to be here any minute.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.596
I can't have you driving around
the living room on a forklift.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.800
Sorry, but one of my boys
called in sick.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.868
Oh, feast your eyes
on this baby.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.438
I know I'm going to be sorry
I asked this

15:38.438 --> 15:39.639
but what is that?

15:39.639 --> 15:41.140
Meet the Relax-a-Cat

15:41.140 --> 15:43.676
the one-stop feline
pleasure center.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.912
Let me demonstrate.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.814
( <i>low rumbling</i> )

15:47.814 --> 15:49.782
Oh, go work it, baby.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.050
That's disgusting.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.552
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

15:52.552 --> 15:53.553
Arthur's here.

15:53.553 --> 15:54.720
Floor show's over.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.721
In a minute.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.056
This is the best part.

15:57.056 --> 16:00.726
No, this is the best part.

16:00.726 --> 16:04.697
( <i>yelling</i> )

16:04.697 --> 16:07.967
Mmm... peanut butter?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.969
Interesting.

16:13.206 --> 16:14.140
Hi.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.009
Hello.
You look absolutely ravishing.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.211
Thank you.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.247
I've always depended on
the compliments of strangers.

16:21.247 --> 16:23.816
I believe the correct
Tennessee William's quote

16:23.816 --> 16:25.585
is "the kindness of strangers."

16:25.585 --> 16:27.453
I was making a joke.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.689
Oh, well,
I'll get my bag.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.524
We'll be on our way.

16:31.524 --> 16:35.795
Hey, Zelda,
what is all this junk?

16:35.795 --> 16:37.697
Just a few
odds and ends.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.499
Shouldn't we be going?

16:39.499 --> 16:43.469
"The Ultimate Kitty
Colon Cleanser."

16:43.469 --> 16:44.904
I'm thinking of starting

16:44.904 --> 16:46.672
a little business
on the side.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.041
I like to dabble
in different fun
things.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.110
A cat colon cleansing company?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.346
You have to admit,
you don't see anyone
else doing it.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.114
"Kitty Culottes"?

16:55.114 --> 16:56.148
"Feline Footwear"?

16:56.148 --> 16:58.217
Zelda, you shouldn't
be wasting your time

16:58.217 --> 16:59.218
with this nonsense.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.286
It's my time.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.587
I can do what
I want with it.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.989
Why are you always
telling me

17:02.989 --> 17:04.490
what I should
and shouldn't do?

17:04.490 --> 17:06.626
It's just... I hate dabblers.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.028
You also hate wines
that aren't from France

17:09.028 --> 17:10.696
restaurants
without Maitre d's

17:10.696 --> 17:12.198
movies without
subtitles...

17:12.198 --> 17:13.199
That's not true.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.901
I enjoyed
<i>Bonfire of the Vanities.</i>

17:14.901 --> 17:16.135
Of course, that was after

17:16.135 --> 17:18.037
a bottle of excellent
French burgundy.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.673
As usual, you're missing
the entire point.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.308
You criticize everything.

17:22.308 --> 17:23.809
Zelda, all I was
trying to say was

17:23.809 --> 17:25.845
it's the dabblers
and dilettantes of the world

17:25.845 --> 17:26.879
who lower the bar

17:26.879 --> 17:28.614
and undermine the work
of serious thinkers.

17:28.614 --> 17:29.916
And it's the narrow-minded

17:29.916 --> 17:31.384
judgmental blowhards
of the world

17:31.384 --> 17:32.518
who stifle creativity.

17:32.518 --> 17:33.452
I hate those people, too.

17:33.452 --> 17:34.787
I was talking about you.

17:34.787 --> 17:35.988
Is that another joke?

17:35.988 --> 17:38.224
Do you see me laughing?

17:38.224 --> 17:41.894
Hey, Salem, you left
your sample case at my house

17:41.894 --> 17:44.297
and there's an awful odor
coming from it.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.400
Yeah, that worm elixir has
a shelf life of one hour.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.069
But I got a new idea
that'll go through the roof.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.437
Flea-nut Butter.

17:51.437 --> 17:53.272
Actually that
doesn't sound too bad

17:53.272 --> 17:54.640
but I just might be giddy

17:54.640 --> 17:57.310
because of my moral victory
with Professor Carlin.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.478
I might be getting
a lower grade. Woo-hoo!

17:59.478 --> 18:00.880
Zelda:
You pompous jerk!

18:00.880 --> 18:02.715
Carlin:
You frivolous
little dilettante.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.383
You should really
be happy now.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.786
Sounds like Zelda's
going to score you an "F."

18:06.786 --> 18:07.887
Woo-hoo!

18:07.887 --> 18:09.956
Oh, no.

18:09.956 --> 18:10.957
I have had it

18:10.957 --> 18:12.758
with your nit-picking
perfectionism

18:12.758 --> 18:14.460
always demanding
that I do better.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.829
Hello! Physically impossible.

18:16.829 --> 18:18.464
I was trying to inspire you.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.633
But obviously,
you're a hopeless case.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.834
You infuriate me.

18:21.834 --> 18:22.835
You disgust me.

18:22.835 --> 18:23.903
You repulse me.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.905
-Are we going to kiss now?
-No.

18:25.905 --> 18:26.906
Just checking.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.907
Hi, guys.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.008
Care for some dried fruit?

18:29.008 --> 18:30.443
No, thank you.
I was just leaving.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.044
Oh, come on.
The figs are
really yummy.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.045
Yummy?

18:33.045 --> 18:34.347
You call yourself
a college student?

18:34.347 --> 18:35.514
You sound
like a five-year-old.

18:35.514 --> 18:37.583
How dare you
insult my niece?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.485
No, no, no.
He was right to insult me.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.053
I'd like to substitute "yummy"

18:41.053 --> 18:42.755
with "gastronomically pleasing."

18:42.755 --> 18:43.823
Don't pander to him.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.758
If you want to say "yummy,"
you say "yummy."

18:45.758 --> 18:48.594
If you want to call
him a big dummy,
you go right ahead.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.695
But I don't want to.

18:49.695 --> 18:50.696
Well, I do.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.032
Dummy, dummy, dummy,
dummy, dummy!

18:53.032 --> 18:54.467
Nanny-nanny-nanny goat.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.304
And on that mature note,
I bid you <i>adieu.</i>

18:58.304 --> 19:02.475
Wait! Wait!

19:02.475 --> 19:04.543
She doesn't know
what she's saying!

19:04.543 --> 19:06.312
She's not my real aunt!

19:06.312 --> 19:08.247
I am so getting an "F."

19:10.282 --> 19:11.784
So, we're into
bribes now.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.886
That is so <i>Godfather.</i>

19:13.886 --> 19:15.087
I like it.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.123
It might be my last chance
to salvage a decent grade.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.858
You really think pork
pate and a hard salami

19:18.858 --> 19:19.859
is going to help you?

19:19.859 --> 19:20.926
And what's that stuff?

19:20.926 --> 19:22.595
Flea-nut butter.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.996
I'm desperate.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.201
Good morning,
Professor Carlin.

19:29.201 --> 19:30.202
Hello, Sabrina.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.138
I just wanted to bring
you some things

19:32.138 --> 19:34.040
to apologize
for the whole dilettante

19:34.040 --> 19:35.541
aunt debacle.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.009
"Debacle"? It's
a good word.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.878
Definitely a step
up from "yummy."

19:38.878 --> 19:40.680
You know, who
was I to argue

19:40.680 --> 19:42.682
with your whole
grading method?

19:42.682 --> 19:45.251
Some naive college
student, that's who.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.420
So, I say let
bygones be bygones.

19:47.420 --> 19:51.457
You know, we go back
to the original grade,
start fresh. Pate?

19:51.457 --> 19:52.658
No, thanks.

19:52.658 --> 19:55.127
Sabrina, I reread your paper,
and you were right.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.862
The grade I gave you
wasn't fair.

19:56.862 --> 19:57.997
So I changed it.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.366
Why did I open my big mouth?

20:00.366 --> 20:01.901
A-plus? Are you drunk?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.135
When I went through it again

20:03.135 --> 20:05.304
I discovered nuances
I'd missed on the first read.

20:05.304 --> 20:06.672
You did a truly superior job.

20:06.672 --> 20:07.973
You deserved a better grade.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.909
Even though my aunt
called you pompous?

20:09.909 --> 20:13.012
Well, I can be
a bit pompous sometimes.

20:13.012 --> 20:15.748
I'm afraid I owe Zelda
an apology.

20:15.748 --> 20:18.117
You know, Professor Carlin,
I just want to point out

20:18.117 --> 20:20.453
that you have a lot of
bright, motivated students.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.487
And I think it's great

20:21.487 --> 20:22.855
that you want
to raise the bar

20:22.855 --> 20:24.790
but sometimes you have
to meet us halfway.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.092
Point taken.

20:26.092 --> 20:28.360
Miss Spellman,
you've a lot of gumption.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.930
"Gumption"? Is that
the best word you
can come up with?

20:30.930 --> 20:32.098
Yes, it was.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.033
And I'm fine with
that; great word.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.810
Great to see you again, Lou.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.645
The years
have been good to you.

20:46.645 --> 20:47.813
You, too.

20:47.813 --> 20:51.217
We got some memories,
don't we, Saberhagen?

20:51.217 --> 20:53.352
We'll always have Bangkok.

20:53.352 --> 20:57.289
Hmm, you know, I thought
I was a goner this time.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.058
Thank God for that ditzy blond

20:59.058 --> 21:01.527
who kept winking at me
from the jury box.

21:01.527 --> 21:02.962
That's my Hildy.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.765
So, let's get down to business.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.066
Ready to buy me out

21:07.066 --> 21:09.568
make a fortune
cleaning cat colons?

21:09.568 --> 21:10.703
I've done worse.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.638
Yeah. To me.

21:12.638 --> 21:15.941
( <i>laughing</i> )

21:15.941 --> 21:18.144
Schnapps?

21:18.144 --> 21:19.111
Please.

21:23.482 --> 21:25.951
To us.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.520
( <i>low humming</i> )

21:27.520 --> 21:29.221
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Oh...

21:29.221 --> 21:30.222
I got the good jet.
