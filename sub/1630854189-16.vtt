Oh, hey, sorry, did I wake you?

(yawns) No. Snowball
either puked up her dinner,

00:11.178 --> 00:13.754
or she's going through
a Jackson Pollock phase.

00:13.906 --> 00:16.164

00:21.263 --> 00:22.412
Oh, a song I'm working on.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.097
I want something new
for when that producer

00:24.174 --> 00:25.415
comes to see me play.

00:25.434 --> 00:26.600
Well, if you need a beatboxer,

00:26.752 --> 00:28.435

00:30.680 --> 00:32.180
That was on there? (groans)

listening to Melinda Gates

00:35.110 --> 00:37.369
teach me about impactful giving.

00:37.596 --> 00:39.020
Play your song for me.

on a rhyme,

00:42.951 --> 00:44.268
I'm pretty good.

00:44.436 --> 00:45.786

all of our cats
are available for rescue.

Great, I'd love to.

Your cat spends the morning on
a carefree frolic in the garden.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.759
Later, you notice red hives

03:05.853 --> 03:07.427
on its belly. What do you do?

03:07.579 --> 03:09.229
What do you do?!

03:10.098 --> 03:11.264
Take her to the vet?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.249
Good answer.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.934
Sorry I got all up in your face.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.195
I just wanted to simulate
the high-intensity experience

03:16.363 --> 03:17.921
of cat ownership. You did great.

03:17.923 --> 03:19.606
There's a box you can check for

03:19.683 --> 03:21.849
"don't want to talk
to this one again."

03:22.761 --> 03:25.186
Go ahead and try
and bring me down, but, uh,

03:25.280 --> 03:27.522
my boyfriend
is writing a song about me.

03:27.616 --> 03:30.617
Really? What did he rhyme
with "settling"?

03:30.694 --> 03:33.045
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.862
Carter's son is coming over
for the weekend,

03:34.957 --> 03:36.289
so I went out and bought
a bunch of things

03:36.442 --> 03:37.941
I thought a 14-year-old boy
might like.

03:38.034 --> 03:39.626
I didn't know
the grocery store sold

03:39.778 --> 03:41.703
marijuana and boobs.

03:41.797 --> 03:43.388
I'm gonna be his stepmom soon,

03:43.540 --> 03:45.206
so I want him to come over
and have fun,

03:45.226 --> 03:47.300
and then go home and tell
his mom that he likes me more

03:47.453 --> 03:48.952
and that I'm prettier.

03:48.971 --> 03:52.456
Well, if you want, I can help
you put the "step" in stepmom.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.567
All right, I'm loving this.

04:12.644 --> 04:14.327
Wow, okay, still going.

04:14.480 --> 04:15.645
Yeah, okay,

04:15.664 --> 04:16.813
not feeling left out at all.

04:16.832 --> 04:19.675
Starting to feel
a little left out.

04:20.986 --> 04:22.577
CJ, I got all
your favorite foods.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.488
I got chicken nuggets,
chicken fingers,

04:24.581 --> 04:25.747
chicken patties,

04:25.841 --> 04:27.248
and something
called Beyond Chicken

04:27.268 --> 04:28.658
that they said
tastes like real chicken,

04:28.677 --> 04:30.385
but it really doesn't
taste like chicken.

04:30.512 --> 04:33.105
Just eat your broccoli
and be sad, vegans.

04:33.332 --> 04:34.998
I was kind of feeling Taco Bell.

04:35.017 --> 04:36.683
Oh, tacos are cool, too.
Let's go.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.594
Uh, hold up. Now, I love Taco
Bell just as much as anyone.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.430
In fact, I'm the one who got the
Mexican Pizza back on the menu.

04:42.524 --> 04:44.190
My grandfather
marched on Washington,

04:44.343 --> 04:45.600
I marched on Chalupa Boulevard.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.954
But Randi bought 200 bucks
worth of groceries,

04:49.123 --> 04:50.938
so we're eating here.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.775
-Fine.
-Buzzkill.
He always buzzkilling.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.295
Oh, no, no,
I'm a part of this one.

04:56.522 --> 04:58.297
(laughs)

04:58.524 --> 05:00.373
Yeah. Uh-uh-uh.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.526
Okay, which one's the producer?

05:02.544 --> 05:04.377
Oh, it's the guy
in the cowboy hat, isn't it?

05:04.454 --> 05:06.046
(country accent):
Sure do like your songs, Max.

05:06.198 --> 05:08.031
I understand
your pretty little filly here

05:08.050 --> 05:09.549
does a mean beatbox. (laughs)

05:09.718 --> 05:11.217
It's actually Kelsey Morgan,

05:11.312 --> 05:13.053
the woman in the pantsuit.

05:13.205 --> 05:14.704
Ugh, damn the patriarchy.

05:14.723 --> 05:17.574
-I've got so much to unlearn.
-(chuckles)

05:17.576 --> 05:18.984
I'm gonna take my seat.

05:19.135 --> 05:21.061
-Wish me luck.
-Break a leg.
And if you get nervous,

05:21.229 --> 05:22.487
just picture the audience naked,

05:22.639 --> 05:24.990
except Randi,
I can't compete with that.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.475
You got this, brother.

05:27.569 --> 05:29.745
(laughs) Yes.

05:32.148 --> 05:34.407
Everyone has one but me.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.668

Where's CJ?

05:36.895 --> 05:38.228
At a movie with a friend.

05:38.230 --> 05:40.413
It's rated R, but I taught him
how to buy a ticket

05:40.566 --> 05:41.915
for another movie and sneak in.

05:42.067 --> 05:44.992

Gabrielle Union?

but very personal to me.

07:16.995 --> 07:19.679
In Saint-Tropez,
in Rome, at Normandy.

07:19.831 --> 07:22.649
It was a different kind
of D-Day.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.514

I talked to Kelsey,

07:48.618 --> 07:51.970
and she wants to record
with me. (laughs)

07:52.121 --> 07:53.713
Why aren't you jumping
up and down with me?

07:53.865 --> 07:56.975
It's weird for a grown man to be
jumping up and down by himself.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.720
Max, why did you change
the song you wrote about me

08:00.872 --> 08:01.813
to be about Brigitte?

08:01.965 --> 08:04.374
Oh, Kat, I think
we both know why.

08:05.060 --> 08:08.010
The song's not about anyone
specifically. I just made it up.

08:08.137 --> 08:10.213
Oh, so you didn't go
skinny-dipping with Brigitte

08:10.232 --> 08:11.973
in La Fontaine Saint-Michel?

08:12.034 --> 08:14.400
I think you're focusing
on the wrong thing here.

08:14.553 --> 08:16.495
Kelsey Morgan
is working on songs

08:16.646 --> 08:18.479
for Chris Stapleton's
next album.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.499
Can't you just
be excited for me?

08:20.667 --> 08:21.983
Well, it's kind of hard
to be excited

08:22.002 --> 08:23.409
when you started writing
a song about me

08:23.562 --> 08:26.153
and ran out of things to say
20 seconds in.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.580
And what would he say?

08:27.733 --> 08:31.343
"Oh, Kat, I love your fruit
with the googly eyes"?

08:31.494 --> 08:33.086
I was so excited to tell you
my good news,

08:33.238 --> 08:35.680
and you're kind of
crapping all over it.

08:35.907 --> 08:38.475
It is because she ate ice cream.

08:41.504 --> 08:44.748
Yes! Winner, winner,
chicken dinner.

08:44.750 --> 08:46.249
And breakfast and lunch.

08:46.268 --> 08:47.859
Seriously, y'all, I bought
a buttload of chicken.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.679
All right, Junior, time for bed.
It's a school night.

08:51.773 --> 08:53.198
Aw, give him a break.

08:53.349 --> 08:55.942
I've been taking him to school
these last six games.

08:56.094 --> 08:57.869
Oh, it's on.

08:58.021 --> 09:00.021
No, it's off.

09:00.115 --> 09:02.115
-Aw, man.
-Boo.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.375
Night, little man.

09:03.526 --> 09:04.859
You might want
to sleep on your stomach

09:04.878 --> 09:07.103
after that spanking
I just gave you.

09:07.122 --> 09:08.454
What are you doing?

09:08.607 --> 09:11.198
-What are you talking about?
-Last night with dinner,

09:11.218 --> 09:12.458
tonight with video games,

09:12.611 --> 09:14.127
you keep making me
the bad cop with CJ.

09:14.279 --> 09:16.112
I'm trying to be
Chris Tucker in<i> Rush Hour,</i>

09:16.131 --> 09:18.782
you got me looking like
Denzel in<i> Training Day.</i>

09:18.800 --> 09:20.800
Well, what's the big deal
if I want to spoil him a little?

09:20.952 --> 09:23.469
I want him to know that
he's gonna have a cool stepmom.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.397
But that means
I have to be the hard-ass,

09:25.473 --> 09:27.974
and that's his mom's job.
She's Denzel.

09:28.068 --> 09:32.529
Trust me, King Kong
ain't got nothing on her!

09:33.723 --> 09:35.481
SHEILA:
Hello, dear.

09:35.634 --> 09:37.576
What are you doing here?

09:37.761 --> 09:39.411
You can't get rid
of any more of my clothes.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.580
I never even got to wear
those orange Crocs.

09:41.807 --> 09:44.657
I know you had a rough night,
so I brought some Chardonnay.

09:44.826 --> 09:47.234
You do realize it's noon?

09:47.312 --> 09:50.404
I know, I'm sorry.
I slept in this morning.

09:50.498 --> 09:52.165
How you doing?

09:52.259 --> 09:53.666
Oh, great.

09:53.819 --> 09:56.744
My boyfriend wrote a song
about his perfect ex-girlfriend,

09:56.838 --> 09:57.912
and I'm having full-fledged

09:57.931 --> 09:59.747
imaginary conversations
with her.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.341
It is torturous for me, too.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.102
I look this good,
and no one else can see me.

10:04.329 --> 10:07.997
As you know, I've had a tune
or two written about me.

10:08.016 --> 10:09.999
I was there the morning
Lionel Richie

10:10.093 --> 10:11.276
wrote "All Night Long."

10:11.353 --> 10:12.777
And...?

10:12.929 --> 10:16.097
And nothing. It's just hard
to work that into conversations.

10:16.116 --> 10:19.100
Max says this is just
the way he writes,

10:19.119 --> 10:20.285
but I can't shake the feeling

10:20.436 --> 10:22.120
that he'd rather
be with Brigitte.

10:22.271 --> 10:23.529
How can you blame him?

10:23.698 --> 10:27.241
He's riding the tea cups
after le Splash Mountain.

10:28.203 --> 10:30.629
Sweetheart,
he's lucky to have you.

10:30.780 --> 10:32.538
You're generous and thoughtful

10:32.633 --> 10:34.115
and loving.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.541
But that's boring.

10:35.694 --> 10:38.378
I want to be sexy
and fun and adventurous.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.547
Well, if you want
to inspire him,

10:41.700 --> 10:43.475
lean into your wild side.

10:43.668 --> 10:44.959
Do something daring

10:44.978 --> 10:46.536
and a little reckless.

10:46.554 --> 10:49.630
Ooh, like Olivia Newton-John
at the end of<i> Grease.</i>

10:49.724 --> 10:52.466
She got a perm, put on
those tight leather pants,

10:52.544 --> 10:54.043
and rode off in a convertible.

10:54.062 --> 10:55.636
That's a wild girl car.

10:55.805 --> 10:59.549
I was thinking a drug-fueled
weekend in Vegas with you, Max,

10:59.567 --> 11:03.403
and an open-minded
Cirque du Soleil acrobat,

11:03.555 --> 11:04.996
but you do you.

11:08.818 --> 11:10.076
Ooh, grab a controller.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.745
Can't. I'm meeting a friend
at the library to study.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.506
How are you supposed to get
better at video games

11:14.733 --> 11:17.233
if you keep going to the library
on a Saturday?

11:17.252 --> 11:19.678
See, this is why China
is kicking our ass.

11:19.829 --> 11:21.680
I've got a project.

11:21.831 --> 11:22.588
Okay.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.831
(bottles clinking)

11:24.000 --> 11:26.351
Wait, what's clinking around
in your backpack?

11:26.502 --> 11:27.668
Nothing.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.262
Boy, I'm from Detroit,

11:29.414 --> 11:32.524
smuggling beer in a backpack
is called a Motown Special.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.359
Wh...

11:34.510 --> 11:35.768
What is wrong with you?

11:35.921 --> 11:37.937
They weren't for me.
My friend Preston wanted them,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.106
but if he's
pressuring me to drink,

11:40.258 --> 11:42.258
I see now he's not
a real friend at all.

11:42.351 --> 11:44.610
Save that weak-ass line
for your dad.

11:44.763 --> 11:47.280
-Oh, what?
You're gonna tell him?
-Of course I am.

11:47.432 --> 11:49.098
If I told him
that Drake slid into my DMs,

11:49.233 --> 11:50.283
I'm gonna tell him this.

11:50.452 --> 11:51.859
-But Randi...
-Uh-uh, go to your room

11:51.878 --> 11:54.528
or time-out or whatever
that crap is that parents say.

11:54.622 --> 11:56.606
If you tell my dad,
then he's gonna tell my mom,

11:56.624 --> 11:57.549
and she's gonna go nuts.

11:57.700 --> 11:58.775
(sighs)

11:58.868 --> 12:00.944
I guess you're not as cool
as I thought.

12:00.962 --> 12:01.886
CJ...

12:02.113 --> 12:03.555
Whatever.

12:06.042 --> 12:08.709
Okay, fine, fine.
I won't tell him.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.286
Seriously? You're the best.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.972
I know. I know. Just make sure
your mom knows, too.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.807
And if you could somehow work
into the conversation

12:14.901 --> 12:16.793
that I know Drake, even better.

12:16.811 --> 12:19.904
I will. Thank you so much.

12:20.741 --> 12:24.617
And just so you know, you wrap
the bottles in a towel, fool.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.064
Is it hot in here
or is it just me?

12:30.158 --> 12:32.417
Trick question, it's both.

12:33.828 --> 12:35.754
Hey. Whoa, you look amazing.

12:35.905 --> 12:37.146
Ooh,

12:37.165 --> 12:38.998
sex candles. Race you to naked.

12:39.150 --> 12:40.500
This counts as foreplay.

12:40.652 --> 12:43.152
-No, no, no, no. Not yet.
We'll get there.
-Oh. Oh...

12:43.171 --> 12:45.004
Because it's our anniversary

12:45.098 --> 12:47.599
that I did not forget.

12:47.750 --> 12:50.417
I ordered your gift,
but, you know, supply chain.

12:50.495 --> 12:53.087
Well, it's not our anniversary.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.515
I wanted to do something
to celebrate your good news

12:55.667 --> 12:57.275
about the producer
with a romantic night

12:57.426 --> 12:59.018
of spontaneous adventure where

12:59.170 --> 13:01.279
-anything can happen.
-Aw, cool.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.281
-Well, we could go b...
-No, no, no, no,

13:03.508 --> 13:05.008
a romantic night
of spontaneous adventure

13:05.101 --> 13:06.451
that I have
completely planned out.

13:06.602 --> 13:09.195
A real adventure
or a Kat adventure?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.847
Because a Kat adventure
always means

13:10.849 --> 13:14.017
I have to look up words
I don't know, like ornithology.

13:14.110 --> 13:15.943
Just say we're going
bird-watching,

13:15.962 --> 13:17.444
so I can get high first.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.023
Well, tonight,
we're gonna get high

13:20.116 --> 13:22.634
on excitement and temerity.

13:23.878 --> 13:25.211
It means recklessness.

13:25.363 --> 13:28.765
Now, go put on some clothes
for getting cr-azy.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.385
You really think
you can compete with me?

13:33.146 --> 13:36.481
After tonight,
Max will be so inspired by me,

13:36.708 --> 13:38.708
he will never
think of you again.

13:38.801 --> 13:40.109
So...

13:43.898 --> 13:46.074
Step off.

13:54.150 --> 13:56.576
Okay, here we are.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.169
Okay, get ready.

13:58.362 --> 14:00.730
One...

14:00.748 --> 14:02.081
-two. I did it on two.
-Whoa.

14:02.250 --> 14:04.250
Temerity. (laughs)

14:04.344 --> 14:05.902
Water tower?

14:05.995 --> 14:08.495
-You gonna whack me?
-No.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.257
We're gonna sneak in
this locked gate.

14:11.409 --> 14:14.243
Uh, whoa, rebellious much?

14:14.262 --> 14:17.430
Climb this bad boy,
take in a spectacular view,

14:17.582 --> 14:19.582
and then write our names
on a little heart

14:19.601 --> 14:20.841
for all the world to see.

14:20.935 --> 14:23.119
You're not exactly dressed
for climbing.

14:23.179 --> 14:25.846
Hey, if my mother can do
a 5K walk in heels

14:25.940 --> 14:27.699
to support
bringing back quaaludes,

14:27.926 --> 14:29.442
I can climb this water tower.

14:29.594 --> 14:31.761
Right.

14:31.854 --> 14:34.188
Just get in here like this.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.190
-Here we go. Oh!
-Oh.

14:36.209 --> 14:38.376
Uh-oh. Ow. Uh, my hair's caught.

14:38.527 --> 14:40.712
Well, not my hair,
my extensions.

14:40.863 --> 14:42.363
They're polyester like my dress.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.531
I guess my theme tonight
is "flammable." (laughs)

14:44.551 --> 14:47.051
-I got you. Ready?
-(stammers) Ow! Ow. No. Ow.

14:47.278 --> 14:48.945
That's actually making it worse.
Let me just-- I got it.

14:48.963 --> 14:51.280
-Okay? Just let me get it.
-Okay.

14:51.299 --> 14:52.298
Ow. Ah.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.725
(screams)

14:55.729 --> 14:57.896
Oh, my God, are you okay?

14:58.047 --> 14:59.305
I'm good.

14:59.457 --> 15:02.025
What a spontaneous moment.

15:02.961 --> 15:05.128
All right, let me just, uh,

15:05.146 --> 15:07.554
let me just wipe my hands off
on this garbage

15:07.723 --> 15:08.648
and then the, uh,

15:08.800 --> 15:11.200
the fun will begin. (laughs)

15:13.729 --> 15:14.987
-Hey, baby.
-Hey.

15:15.140 --> 15:18.324
Guess who ate 76 olives
in under a minute?

15:18.476 --> 15:20.309
I don't know,
but he sounds like an idiot.

15:20.403 --> 15:22.645
Yeah, yeah, that Darren.
(laughs)

15:22.664 --> 15:24.313
He sure is stupid.

15:24.407 --> 15:26.090
Hey, I was thinking,
uh, tomorrow,

15:26.317 --> 15:27.442
we take CJ to Dave & Buster's.

15:27.444 --> 15:29.576
Seal the deal that
you the coolest stepmom.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.488
S-So, listen,
something happened earlier,

15:32.548 --> 15:35.099
and I felt like I did
the right thing at the time,

15:35.326 --> 15:38.752
but... now I kind of feel like
I should tell you about it.

15:38.846 --> 15:41.013
Damn it,
is Drake's light-skinned ass

15:41.166 --> 15:42.589
texting you again?

15:42.684 --> 15:44.943
It's not that.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.928
-I caught CJ stealing beer.
-What?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.280
But I promised him
that I wouldn't tell,

15:49.507 --> 15:50.281
so you can't
do anything about it.

15:50.508 --> 15:51.932
He stole a bottle of my beer,

15:52.026 --> 15:54.010
I'm gonna open up a can
of my whoop-ass.

15:54.028 --> 15:55.678
But if you snitch on me
being a snitch

15:55.697 --> 15:57.146
then we both gonna get stitches,

15:57.148 --> 15:59.348
and it's a new year,
so I know you're not even close

15:59.367 --> 16:00.700
to fulfilling your deductible.

16:00.852 --> 16:02.443
Look, drinking is different

16:02.462 --> 16:04.704
than fast food for dinner
or video games.

16:04.856 --> 16:06.355
If you let him slide on this,

16:06.449 --> 16:07.690
he's gonna think he can
get away with anything.

16:07.709 --> 16:10.259
Yeah, Drake said the same thing.

16:11.454 --> 16:13.454
I just don't want him
to hate me.

16:13.506 --> 16:14.955
I get it.

16:15.049 --> 16:17.458
You're about to be a stepmom
to a teenager, that isn't easy.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.702
This is the hardest part
about being a parent.

16:19.721 --> 16:21.754
If they don't hate you
every now and then,

16:21.889 --> 16:24.190
it means
you're not doing it right.

16:25.393 --> 16:26.709
Okay.

16:26.802 --> 16:28.544
I guess we should
just go talk to him.

16:28.637 --> 16:31.155
I'll do it by myself,
take the heat off of you.

16:31.382 --> 16:33.640
No, no, I want to be there.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.702
So, do we use your belt or mine?

16:36.645 --> 16:38.538
Kidding. Right?

16:41.893 --> 16:43.909
-(wind whistling)
-Oh, wow.

16:44.062 --> 16:45.411
This is incredible.

16:45.563 --> 16:47.321
I've never seen the city
from up here.

16:47.415 --> 16:50.233
Yeah, and this high up,
you can barely smell the sulfur

16:50.251 --> 16:52.401
from the tire factory.

16:52.495 --> 16:55.829
This is, this is our home town.
(laughs)

16:55.998 --> 16:58.182
Wow! (spits)

16:58.409 --> 17:01.185
I feel like Beyoncé
in "Crazy In Love."

17:01.337 --> 17:02.687
I, uh,

17:02.856 --> 17:06.507
wrote you a poem for tonight.

17:06.675 --> 17:08.026
Just... Oh!

17:08.253 --> 17:11.587
Oh! Crap. There it goes.

17:11.606 --> 17:13.680
You'll have to trust me,
it was really good.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.034
I rhymed "salad" and "valid."

17:16.185 --> 17:19.445
I don't need a poem. Come here.

17:19.597 --> 17:21.205
Oh...

17:21.357 --> 17:24.709
My heel's caught.
(stammers, shrieks)

17:24.860 --> 17:26.285
Oh.

17:26.437 --> 17:27.937
(sighs)

17:27.955 --> 17:29.772
You okay?

17:29.865 --> 17:31.440
I've never been better.

17:31.459 --> 17:33.959
-(siren chirps)
-OFFICER: This is the
Louisville Police.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.386
You are trespassing.

17:35.496 --> 17:37.055
(screams)

17:37.206 --> 17:38.372
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

17:38.466 --> 17:41.951
Oh, it's okay.
Just another memory.

17:41.969 --> 17:44.937
We'll be right down.

17:45.973 --> 17:48.291
Our night ended
in handcuffs, too,

17:48.309 --> 17:51.152
but not in the same way.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.641
Sorry tonight was such a fail.

18:05.734 --> 18:09.662
Only song you could write
about this would be "Womp Womp."

18:10.815 --> 18:13.925
I kind of thought
that's what this was about.

18:14.152 --> 18:16.485
Why are you trying
to compete with a song?

18:16.504 --> 18:20.156
Because your relationship
with Brigitte was so passionate

18:20.174 --> 18:24.251
and exciting and chock-full
of public nudity.

18:24.329 --> 18:26.086
Well, so is a night on ecstasy,

18:26.164 --> 18:28.255
but when you wake up naked
under an overpass,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.516
you wish you'd never done it.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.193
I have heard.

18:33.521 --> 18:36.531
I'm not with Brigitte
for a reason.

18:38.267 --> 18:41.160
I just want to be
exciting for you.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.513
You are.

18:44.532 --> 18:47.625
And if what you really need
is a song

18:47.776 --> 18:50.369
that's all about you,

18:50.521 --> 18:53.464
I can't think of anything
easier to write.

18:56.861 --> 18:59.971
Would it help if I laid down
a fresh funky beat?

19:01.215 --> 19:03.516
-It would not.
