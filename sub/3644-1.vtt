WEBVTT

00:06.794 --> 00:09.096
(Squeaking)

00:09.098 --> 00:12.199
(Dial tones beeping)

00:18.406 --> 00:20.507
I'm in.

00:23.912 --> 00:25.979
(Beeping continues)

01:04.152 --> 01:06.253
(Gasps)

01:18.566 --> 01:20.968
(Beeping resumes)

01:44.926 --> 01:46.493
(Beeping)

01:47.962 --> 01:49.563
Oh, no.

02:06.047 --> 02:08.048
Kirsten Clark, this is a very serious

02:08.050 --> 02:09.515
accusation against you.

02:09.518 --> 02:11.184
You do understand that?

02:11.186 --> 02:13.800
I understood the first three
times you told me, Doctor Hardwyck.

02:13.888 --> 02:16.923
Do you mind not doing
that while I talk with you?

02:17.959 --> 02:19.192
Thank you.

02:19.194 --> 02:20.694
Do you have a response for Camille?

02:20.696 --> 02:22.062
Yes.

02:22.064 --> 02:23.430
Why would I sabotage her research

02:23.432 --> 02:24.931
when she's perfectly capable

02:24.933 --> 02:26.600
of screwing it up by herself?

02:26.602 --> 02:28.135
See?

02:28.137 --> 02:30.037
This is the crap I've been
getting from her all year.

02:30.039 --> 02:31.538
Kirsten: I don't say this maliciously.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.173
It's just that Camille's
work is often shoddy.

02:33.175 --> 02:34.541
I believe her grades reflect that.

02:34.543 --> 02:36.410
We share a house, so she had access

02:36.412 --> 02:38.278
to my optogenetics harness. Plus she wants

02:38.280 --> 02:39.946
to publish first, so she has a motive.

02:39.948 --> 02:42.616
I demand a full investigation,
and I want Kirsten

02:42.618 --> 02:45.085
placed on academic suspension
while it's taking place.

02:45.087 --> 02:47.120
This is about the dishes I
left in the sink, isn't it?

02:47.122 --> 02:49.022
What? No. You think I want you

02:49.024 --> 02:50.457
suspended because you
left dishes in the sink?

02:50.459 --> 02:54.428
Would it kill you to clean up the
kitchen after you're done in there?

02:54.430 --> 02:56.063
I don't know. Would it kill you

02:56.065 --> 02:57.364
to close your door when
you have a guy over?

02:57.366 --> 02:59.066
- That was one time.
- Kirsten, Camille,

02:59.068 --> 03:01.168
I need you ladies to focus, all right?

03:01.170 --> 03:03.603
Academic suspension is the nuclear option.

03:03.605 --> 03:06.560
There must be some way Kristen
can prove she didn't do it.

03:06.674 --> 03:09.042
We also can't rule out that Camille
did this to herself to sabotage me.

03:09.044 --> 03:10.577
I'll take a polygraph right now...

03:10.579 --> 03:12.979
right now. How about you?

03:12.981 --> 03:15.148
I'd fail.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.751
That sounds like an
admission of guilt to me.

03:17.753 --> 03:20.153
Polygraphs don't work on me. I fail them.

03:20.155 --> 03:22.489
Because of this condition
of yours... temporal...

03:22.491 --> 03:25.025
- Dysplasia, yes.
- That's convenient.

03:25.027 --> 03:27.994
Kirsten, we run a strict code of conduct

03:27.996 --> 03:30.997
here in the PhD program.
Till further notice,

03:30.999 --> 03:33.333
I'm gonna place you on academic suspension.

03:33.335 --> 03:34.601
Sorry.

03:37.472 --> 03:40.741
There, it's fixed. You're welcome.

03:43.678 --> 03:45.512
Okay?

03:49.550 --> 03:52.185
- Kirsten Clark?
- Yes.

03:52.187 --> 03:54.187
Detective Fisher, L.A.P.D.

03:55.490 --> 03:58.091
I'm sorry, Miss Clark,
I have some bad news.

04:04.265 --> 04:06.133
That's him.

04:06.135 --> 04:08.068
- Would you like a moment?
- To do what?

04:08.070 --> 04:10.103
To be alone with your father.

04:18.112 --> 04:19.312
Turn around.

04:30.224 --> 04:32.325
Turn around.

04:42.370 --> 04:44.171
No, I'm good.

04:44.173 --> 04:46.473
The police department has
a grief counselor available

04:46.475 --> 04:47.741
if you'd like to speak to someone.

04:47.743 --> 04:50.177
- Are you sure he killed himself?
- Yes.

04:51.078 --> 04:52.846
I think you're wrong.

04:52.848 --> 04:55.115
When someone shoots themselves,
compared to when they're shot

04:55.117 --> 04:57.384
by someone else, there are certain...

04:57.386 --> 04:59.085
are you sure you want to hear this?

04:59.087 --> 05:00.587
Certain what?

05:00.589 --> 05:02.823
Indicators... powder residue
on the suicide's hand,

05:02.825 --> 05:06.092
location of the wound, number of
shots fired, angle of the shot.

05:06.094 --> 05:09.095
Every indicator about your
father points to suicide.

05:09.097 --> 05:10.630
He shot himself in the chest.

05:10.632 --> 05:12.632
The head is favored by 75% of suicides.

05:12.634 --> 05:15.101
Which means the chest is favored by 25%.

05:15.103 --> 05:17.337
He obviously falls in that percentile.

05:18.406 --> 05:19.873
What about the gun?

05:21.642 --> 05:23.410
It fell on the floor next to him.

05:23.412 --> 05:25.111
- Near which hand?
- His right.

05:25.113 --> 05:26.480
- He was left-handed.
- Doesn't matter.

05:26.482 --> 05:28.281
- Why not?
- He shot himself in the heart.

05:28.283 --> 05:30.517
It's easier to do that with
your right hand than your left.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.589
We photographed the entire
room, over 400 pictures.

05:35.591 --> 05:37.157
I want copies.

05:37.159 --> 05:39.226
It doesn't work that way.

05:40.161 --> 05:42.829
Why weren't you and your father close?

05:42.831 --> 05:44.331
What makes you think that?

05:44.333 --> 05:46.166
Because the usual reaction I see

05:46.168 --> 05:48.435
when someone's parent is
killed is different than yours.

05:48.437 --> 05:50.570
- You've seen a lot of that?
- Yes.

05:50.572 --> 05:52.305
My heart weeps for you.

05:53.241 --> 05:55.275
Why weren't you close?

05:55.277 --> 05:58.178
- I didn't kill him.
- I wasn't implying you did.

05:58.180 --> 06:01.281
Good, because I was in class
this morning when he was murdered.

06:01.283 --> 06:03.350
- Check with the university.
- I already did.

06:03.352 --> 06:04.651
And it was a suicide.

06:04.653 --> 06:07.187
Man: Fisher, you're up.

06:07.189 --> 06:09.489
Excuse me.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.491
Man on TV: ... At least three seriously.

06:11.493 --> 06:13.827
<i>A spokesman for Applied
Holographics says</i>

06:13.829 --> 06:16.496
- <i>that the company will issue a statement later today...
- (Phone camera clicks)</i>

06:16.498 --> 06:18.798
<i>... and that their
main concern right now</i>

06:18.800 --> 06:21.268
is the safety of their staff.
The cause of the explosion...

06:21.270 --> 06:23.770
Same device used yesterday
at the Elmwood apartments?

06:25.673 --> 06:27.173
We'll talk about it later.

06:27.175 --> 06:29.442
Don't stress. I'm finished.

06:30.611 --> 06:32.546
Why weren't you and your father close?

06:32.548 --> 06:34.481
You're the detective.

06:34.483 --> 06:36.816
Detect.

06:38.853 --> 06:42.889
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

06:52.466 --> 06:54.568
What are you doing?

06:54.570 --> 06:56.469
- Kicking you out.
- This is my house.

06:56.471 --> 06:58.905
Not after I sue you for academic sabotage.

07:00.341 --> 07:01.441
(Scoffs)

07:05.513 --> 07:07.547
It's not your room anymore.

07:09.216 --> 07:10.750
Can I get you anything?

07:10.752 --> 07:13.219
A cold drink? Restraining order?

07:14.789 --> 07:17.657
I'm locked out of the
university's computer system.

07:17.659 --> 07:19.292
Yes, you're on academic suspension,

07:19.294 --> 07:21.227
so Hardwyck revoked your account.

07:21.229 --> 07:24.230
You know it wasn't me.
Maybe it was that horny T.A.

07:24.232 --> 07:26.766
you screwed for an "A." He seemed
threatened by how smart you are.

07:26.768 --> 07:29.502
Okay, I know you don't get
relationships, like, at all,

07:29.504 --> 07:31.638
but I don't need to
screw anyone for an "A."

07:31.640 --> 07:33.873
Maybe not, but it wouldn't hurt your G.P.A.

07:33.875 --> 07:35.675
if you did Hardwyck once or twice.

07:36.777 --> 07:39.579
Look, I'm not striking the right tone here.

07:39.581 --> 07:41.348
I need to use your laptop.

07:41.350 --> 07:44.017
What? Are you... what?

07:46.454 --> 07:49.556
No. No way.

07:49.558 --> 07:51.524
You probably didn't hear,

07:51.526 --> 07:54.260
but someone close to me died today.

07:54.262 --> 07:56.296
What? Who?

07:56.298 --> 07:58.565
Doesn't matter. But I want
to look at the police files,

07:58.567 --> 08:00.433
and the only way to access them

08:00.435 --> 08:01.868
is with an exploit I wrote last semester.

08:01.870 --> 08:04.371
- The face recognition one?
- No, a back door probe.

08:04.373 --> 08:06.339
It's behind the university's firewall.

08:06.341 --> 08:08.842
Okay, you want to use my laptop

08:08.844 --> 08:10.810
to hack into the L.A.P.D.'s data server?

08:10.812 --> 08:11.845
Yes.

08:11.847 --> 08:15.315
Well, that's... help me,

08:15.317 --> 08:17.651
what is the word I'm looking for? Illegal.

08:17.653 --> 08:20.286
So that's a no on the laptop?

08:21.455 --> 08:24.357
You would have a better chance
breaking into Hardwyck's office

08:24.359 --> 08:27.360
and using his computer than borrowing mine.

08:27.362 --> 08:29.329
Okay.

08:31.298 --> 08:33.299
- (Door opens, closes)
- I'm pretty sure I was kidding.

08:33.301 --> 08:34.467
No?

08:48.616 --> 08:49.683
(Beeps, whirs)

08:49.685 --> 08:51.484
Good night, Vanessa.

08:51.486 --> 08:53.386
Good night, Professor.

08:59.460 --> 09:02.429
Worn-down keys.

09:03.164 --> 09:04.431
(Beeping)

09:08.502 --> 09:09.803
(Chirps, whirs)

09:47.374 --> 09:49.142
Stay where you are.

09:49.144 --> 09:50.643
(Radio chatter)

09:52.847 --> 09:54.748
You guys are a little over-dressed

09:54.750 --> 09:57.150
for campus security, don't you think?

10:11.999 --> 10:13.700
Don't I at least get to make a phone call?

10:13.702 --> 10:15.935
Woman: To whom? Everyone you know

10:15.937 --> 10:18.404
is either dead or hates you.

10:18.406 --> 10:20.540
<i>I could call a lawyer.</i>

10:20.542 --> 10:22.575
Lawyers aren't really my thing.

10:22.577 --> 10:24.644
Tell me about your father.

10:24.646 --> 10:25.912
Why did he kill himself?

10:25.914 --> 10:27.680
He didn't. And he wasn't my father.

10:27.682 --> 10:29.482
I know,

10:29.484 --> 10:31.084
but I don't know what else to call him.

10:31.086 --> 10:34.521
My real father parked me
with him when I was eight.

10:34.523 --> 10:36.589
What do you know about your real father?

10:36.591 --> 10:38.825
- Nothing.
- Not true.

10:38.827 --> 10:41.127
I know he didn't want
a kid. Does that count?

10:42.062 --> 10:44.497
Why did your father place you with Ed?

10:44.499 --> 10:45.899
Place me?

10:45.901 --> 10:47.500
I wasn't placed. When my mother died,

10:47.502 --> 10:49.469
daddy saw no benefit in me.

10:49.471 --> 10:51.538
We had no family. He and Ed were friends.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.740
Ed agreed to take me in. I
wasn't placed. I was abandoned.

10:53.742 --> 10:55.842
But Ed never formally adopted you.

10:55.844 --> 10:58.044
- That was something neither he nor I wanted.
- Why not?

10:58.046 --> 11:01.514
Because it would have implied a
closeness that didn't exist. Where am I?

11:01.516 --> 11:04.217
Is that why you didn't feel
anything when you saw him dead?

11:04.219 --> 11:06.019
How do you know that?

11:06.021 --> 11:08.822
I have access to certain police records.

11:08.824 --> 11:11.491
Why didn't you feel
anything when you saw Ed?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.694
You wouldn't understand.

11:14.696 --> 11:17.497
Try me. I'm a very understanding person.

11:17.499 --> 11:19.232
You can ask anyone.

11:21.135 --> 11:22.836
How long have I been in this room?

11:22.838 --> 11:24.637
- Answer my question.
- I'm trying to.

11:24.639 --> 11:27.473
- How long have I been in this room?
- Guess.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.010
- An hour.
- One minute.

11:33.514 --> 11:35.148
You really don't know, do you?

11:35.150 --> 11:36.683
I have this condition.

11:36.685 --> 11:38.818
It's called "temporal dysplasia."

11:38.820 --> 11:40.820
I have no time perception.

11:40.822 --> 11:43.623
I've read about the condition.
I thought it was made up.

11:43.625 --> 11:46.526
I wish, 'cause then you can
unmake it up. It really sucks.

11:46.528 --> 11:48.595
I use memory, logic, and math

11:48.597 --> 11:50.096
to approximate a time difference,

11:50.098 --> 11:52.498
but I don't know what time feels like.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.834
- Memory, math, and logic?
- Tell me where I am.

11:54.836 --> 11:56.603
- Downtown L.A.
- Fine.

11:56.605 --> 11:57.904
You say I've been in
this room for one minute.

11:57.906 --> 11:59.606
Let's work backwards. Try to follow.

11:59.608 --> 12:03.676
It's a 22-minute car trip
from Caltech to downtown.

12:03.678 --> 12:06.079
I didn't have to pee, and I wasn't hungry,

12:06.081 --> 12:09.015
so I know I wasn't in Hardwyck's
office for more than an hour.

12:09.017 --> 12:11.584
The Uber ride to Caltech from my place

12:11.586 --> 12:13.720
is 44 minutes on average.

12:13.722 --> 12:15.555
Let's add 10 minutes at
home with my roommate,

12:15.557 --> 12:17.590
because that's what I
think I can tolerate of her.

12:17.592 --> 12:20.159
It's 47 minutes from my
house to the police station.

12:20.161 --> 12:22.161
And I know I spent 73
minutes viewing dead Ed

12:22.163 --> 12:23.696
and talking with Detective Tight-Ass,

12:23.698 --> 12:25.765
because I checked the
time. So, doing the math,

12:25.767 --> 12:27.567
that's four hours and eight minutes.

12:27.569 --> 12:29.068
But that's just numbers.

12:29.070 --> 12:31.537
I don't know what four hours
and eight minutes feels like.

12:31.539 --> 12:33.139
I don't even know how
long I just spoke for.

12:33.141 --> 12:34.641
46 seconds.

12:34.643 --> 12:36.809
My time perception is spot on.

12:36.811 --> 12:38.778
The reason I didn't react

12:38.780 --> 12:40.546
when I saw Ed in the morgue

12:40.548 --> 12:43.182
is because the moment I saw him,

12:43.184 --> 12:45.051
it was as if he had been dead forever.

12:45.053 --> 12:47.654
The moment I saw him, the
knowledge of him being dead

12:47.656 --> 12:49.589
was instantly familiar.

12:49.591 --> 12:51.591
That's temporal dysplasia.

12:51.593 --> 12:52.992
May I go now?

12:52.994 --> 12:57.030
You have been on my radar a long time.

12:57.032 --> 12:58.731
Really? Then why am I now

12:58.733 --> 13:00.867
off your radar and in
your Chinese restaurant?

13:00.869 --> 13:02.669
My name is Maggie Baptiste,

13:02.671 --> 13:04.671
and I'm working on a
project that needs someone

13:04.673 --> 13:06.606
with your particular aptitude.

13:06.608 --> 13:08.875
There are projects that need
someone with temporal dysplasia?

13:08.877 --> 13:10.743
One. Mine.

13:10.745 --> 13:12.745
I represent a federal agency

13:12.747 --> 13:14.747
that's investigating a very serious crime.

13:14.749 --> 13:16.950
- FBI?
- Don't waste your time guessing.

13:16.952 --> 13:19.719
That's good, Maggie Baptiste,
because I'm already not interested.

13:19.721 --> 13:22.055
This crime is extremely time-sensitive,

13:22.057 --> 13:24.057
- life and death.
- I already have a crime to solve.

13:24.059 --> 13:26.726
Don't get up. I'll show myself out.

13:26.728 --> 13:28.227
(Sighs)

13:28.229 --> 13:30.663
Kirsten,

13:30.665 --> 13:32.665
you have two choices.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.233
One... you come work with me.

13:34.235 --> 13:36.369
At your unguessable agency?

13:36.371 --> 13:39.038
Two... I let you leave.

13:39.040 --> 13:41.607
Your roommate just kicked you out,

13:41.609 --> 13:43.176
so you have nowhere to live,

13:43.178 --> 13:44.811
and you're on academic suspension,

13:44.813 --> 13:47.013
so your doctoral plans are officially crap.

13:47.015 --> 13:49.949
And the only person who may
or may not have cared about you

13:49.951 --> 13:51.985
may or may not have killed himself,

13:51.987 --> 13:53.953
you have no money and nowhere to go.

13:54.888 --> 13:56.889
I know a horny T.A.

13:56.891 --> 13:58.891
I could swap sex with for a place to stay.

13:58.893 --> 14:01.294
I know that's not who
you are, and so do you.

14:02.763 --> 14:04.764
Someone with temporal dysplasia

14:04.766 --> 14:06.833
can work at your unguessable agency?

14:06.835 --> 14:08.768
Let's find out.

14:29.690 --> 14:32.025
- (Beeping)
- (Whirring)

14:49.009 --> 14:51.377
(Computers beeping)

14:54.681 --> 14:56.916
(People chattering)

15:03.190 --> 15:06.426
Welcome to the Stitchers program.

15:12.766 --> 15:14.767
What is that?

15:15.702 --> 15:17.870
We call it the fish tank.

15:17.872 --> 15:20.840
Is that because it looks like a fish tank?

15:20.842 --> 15:23.142
I hope you people are
smarter than you are creative.

15:23.144 --> 15:25.745
I thought we were gonna wait
till she had her psych evaluation.

15:25.747 --> 15:27.980
There's no time. Interview
her if you feel the need,

15:27.982 --> 15:30.383
- but I want her prepped in 20.
- Prepped for what?

15:30.385 --> 15:34.720
What's your problem that makes it
that you don't have any friends?

15:34.722 --> 15:36.489
Why do you smell like meat?

15:36.491 --> 15:38.357
I had beef fry for breakfast.

15:38.359 --> 15:40.760
Beef fry? Is that a quantum computer?

15:40.762 --> 15:42.228
It's like bacon, but made with beef.

15:42.230 --> 15:44.097
- What are you, Muslim?
- No, I'm an atheist.

15:44.099 --> 15:46.432
- Atheists don't eat pig?
- Not if it makes their grandmother sad.

15:46.434 --> 15:48.134
- She Muslim?
- Jew-ish.

15:48.136 --> 15:50.136
You gonna stalk her on
koshermatchmaker.com?

15:50.138 --> 15:52.305
- I'm just asking.
- No, you're just jabbering.

15:52.307 --> 15:54.407
You ever been diagnosed?
You may be clinical.

15:54.409 --> 15:56.742
You're like Gollum. You've been
living in your cave so long,

15:56.744 --> 15:58.377
you've forgotten how to talk
to the rest of us hobbits.

15:58.379 --> 16:00.513
A simple Tolkien reference, and
I'm supposed to be impressed?

16:00.515 --> 16:03.516
Name all the actors who
played Doctor Who since 1963,

16:03.518 --> 16:05.518
and maybe you'll get a reaction out of me.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.436
I'm the smartest person in my program.

16:07.437 --> 16:09.217
Oh, so in your little
circle you're the smartest?

16:09.218 --> 16:11.958
- So what does that make you? Queen of the <i>Estupidos </i> ?
- You're quite the tool.

16:11.960 --> 16:14.427
Thanks for making my point for me.

16:15.762 --> 16:17.263
Okay, that concludes our interview.

16:17.265 --> 16:19.398
Has anyone actually explained
to you what we do here?

16:25.172 --> 16:27.440
This is the second corpse I've seen today.

16:27.442 --> 16:30.209
Probably not your fault. Probably.

16:30.211 --> 16:31.944
What did he die of?

16:31.946 --> 16:34.847
He died of explosion...
explosive concussion,

16:34.849 --> 16:36.916
if you want to get all
technical, and I know you do.

16:36.918 --> 16:38.784
- Who is he?
- You heard about the two bombs...

16:38.786 --> 16:40.820
one yesterday and one from today?

16:40.822 --> 16:43.289
This gent's our bomber... Peter Brandt.

16:43.291 --> 16:45.291
28 years old, recently graduated

16:45.293 --> 16:48.060
from the chemical engineering
program at U.C. Santa Monica

16:48.062 --> 16:51.130
with a master's in... wait for it...

16:51.132 --> 16:53.966
energetic molecular studies. Explosives.

16:53.968 --> 16:55.868
Why is he here? Are you guys coroners?

16:55.870 --> 16:57.870
No, he's here to share
his memories with us.

16:57.872 --> 16:59.372
But he's dead.

16:59.374 --> 17:01.274
Fun fact... after death,

17:01.276 --> 17:03.342
consciousness lingers for 30 seconds.

17:03.344 --> 17:06.512
After 10 minutes, the
brain starts to degrade.

17:06.513 --> 17:09.147
If we get a sample in here fast
enough, we can start a protocol

17:09.150 --> 17:11.184
that will slow down further
deterioration for days.

17:11.185 --> 17:13.819
- Sample? You mean corpse?
- Tomato, to-mah-to.

17:13.820 --> 17:15.820
You're getting this guy's
dead, degrading brain

17:15.823 --> 17:17.290
to talk to you? How?

17:17.291 --> 17:20.560
By inserting a living
consciousness into those memories.

17:20.561 --> 17:21.993
We call it "stitching."

17:21.996 --> 17:23.963
- That's impossible.
- Is that so,

17:23.964 --> 17:26.999
Dr. I've-never-studied-
neuroscience-unlike-Cameron?

17:27.001 --> 17:29.835
The brain is a bioelectrical device,

17:29.837 --> 17:31.237
emphasis on "electrical."

17:31.239 --> 17:32.838
Even after death, the wiring,

17:32.840 --> 17:34.907
the synapses... they're
all still in there...

17:34.909 --> 17:36.509
For a while anyways.

17:36.511 --> 17:38.377
And that means, so are the memories.

17:38.379 --> 17:41.113
But it takes a living consciousness
to access and interpret them.

17:41.115 --> 17:42.982
And that's where you come in.

17:42.984 --> 17:45.384
You want to insert my consciousness
into this guy's dead brain?

17:45.386 --> 17:47.486
It sounds icky when you put it like that.

17:47.488 --> 17:49.989
- Has anyone ever done this before?
- Gone in? One person.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.557
Her name's Marta. She's
no longer with the program.

17:51.559 --> 17:53.125
Why not?

17:53.127 --> 17:55.995
She couldn't handle it.

17:55.997 --> 17:58.164
So what do you want me to do
once I'm inside his memories?

17:58.166 --> 18:00.166
We think yesterday's bomb was an accident.

18:00.168 --> 18:02.235
Brandt blew up his
apartment while prepping it.

18:02.237 --> 18:04.136
The second bomb, the
one from this morning...

18:04.138 --> 18:06.005
that one took out a high-tech
firm in Santa Monica.

18:06.007 --> 18:09.041
If Brandt died yesterday, how
did he set off a bomb today?

18:09.043 --> 18:10.910
That, Sparky, is the question.

18:10.912 --> 18:13.045
We traced some shady Bitcoin
transactions Brandt made.

18:13.047 --> 18:15.648
Past month, he purchased
enough explosives, timers,

18:15.650 --> 18:18.184
circuit boards, pressure
switches to make four bombs.

18:18.186 --> 18:20.519
And you think he planted the
other bombs before he died?

18:20.521 --> 18:22.255
Well, that's the nightmare scenario.

18:22.257 --> 18:24.190
The bomb that took out
Brandt's apartment downtown...

18:24.192 --> 18:25.891
that was just big enough for one device.

18:25.893 --> 18:27.326
That means there are two
devices unaccounted for.

18:27.328 --> 18:29.195
We need you to go back into Brandt's memory

18:29.197 --> 18:30.997
and find out where those
other two bombs are.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.099
There are a whack of lives at stake.

18:33.101 --> 18:34.967
- This really works?
- Mm-hmm.

18:34.969 --> 18:36.102
Show me.

18:36.104 --> 18:37.436
All right.

18:37.438 --> 18:39.939
Let's get those clothes
off you and get busy.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.020
When you're inside someone else's memory,

18:43.022 --> 18:44.622
your mind projects an image of yourself

18:44.624 --> 18:46.957
as if you were actually there.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.560
Dressed like this?

18:49.562 --> 18:52.530
Yep. That material is
a mesh polyester fiber

18:52.532 --> 18:55.032
coated in zinc-blackened
nickel over copper.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.234
Makes for a better connection

18:57.236 --> 18:59.103
between your skin and our sensors.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.971
- Whose idea was that?
- That would be me.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.473
Cameron: This is Linus. He handles

19:02.475 --> 19:05.209
bioelectrical engineering
and communications.

19:05.211 --> 19:07.078
Originally you were supposed
to be completely naked,

19:07.080 --> 19:09.180
but there was some
pushback, so we compromised.

19:09.182 --> 19:11.349
- By dressing me up as Catwoman?
- Oh, it's cool.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.084
We're men of science.

19:13.086 --> 19:14.618
Comm links.

19:14.620 --> 19:16.520
We'll be able to talk to
each other through these.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.723
I'll be driving Brandt's memory for you,

19:18.725 --> 19:20.725
but I'll be driving blindfolded,
so you gotta lead me.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.993
How do I choose which memory to go to?

19:22.995 --> 19:24.628
When we get a new sample,

19:24.630 --> 19:26.430
the first thing we do
is map their memories.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.499
Some have incredibly
strong synaptic connections,

19:28.501 --> 19:30.301
which means those are
more emotionally charged.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.303
Those memories will pull you like a magnet.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.239
Oh, this is Ayo. She's here to
make sure you don't get dead.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.341
Nice.

19:37.343 --> 19:41.011
Kirsten, are you ready?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.747
Let's find out.

19:46.051 --> 19:49.153
Okay, Stretch, into the drink.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.289
Stations, everyone.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.459
Keep your feet in contact with the pads.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.661
- Why?
- Anchor points. You'll need them.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.497
- For what?
- You'll see.

19:59.499 --> 20:02.032
Lights to 20%, please.

20:03.235 --> 20:05.503
<i>Okay, everyone, the
mission clock is running.</i>

20:05.505 --> 20:09.106
Captain's log, Stardate 2015.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.075
- Seriously?
- Look, I don't tell you

20:11.077 --> 20:13.210
how to be an emotionally vacant,
relationshiply void young woman;

20:13.212 --> 20:15.212
you don't tell me how to run my lab.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.548
- Fair enough.
- Stardate...

20:17.550 --> 20:19.550
you know what? Never mind.
Forget it. You ruined it.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.619
All right, I need a go,
no-go for stitch neurosync.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.320
- Life-sci.
- Good to go.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.755
- Sub-bio.
- Go.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.191
- Engineering.
- All systems online. Go.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.693
- Communications.
- Go for the stitch, <i>mon capitaine !</i>

20:29.695 --> 20:33.097
- Medical.
- She's looking good. Go.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.666
- Comm check. One-two, one-two.
- I hear you.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.735
See those keyboards under your hand?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.371
You're going to use those to
bounce yourself out of the memory.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.541
When the time comes, you're going
to type in your username "Kirsten,"

20:43.543 --> 20:45.176
followed by your exit pin code.

20:45.178 --> 20:47.344
What's my pin code?

20:48.346 --> 20:52.216
"iheartlinus," lowercase, no spaces.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.518
- I can change that, right?
- Absolutely not.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
Comm check complete. Okay, we are go.

20:56.522 --> 20:59.623
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.760
You're on, princess.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.829
Close your eyes. Try to relax

21:04.831 --> 21:07.431
and don't forget, whatever you
see in there, you're not alone.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.600
I'm with you.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.101
Trust me.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.304
Aye-aye, <i>mon capitaine.</i>

21:13.306 --> 21:15.306
Stitch neurosync in three,

21:15.308 --> 21:19.243
two, one.

21:19.245 --> 21:21.545
Mark.

21:26.318 --> 21:28.385
(Gasps, breathing hard)

21:46.905 --> 21:49.139
- Cameron: <i>Slow your breathing down.
- Where am I?</i>

21:49.141 --> 21:51.208
<i>In Brandt's apartment.
There must be some clue</i>

21:51.210 --> 21:52.776
<i>to where he planted those bombs.</i>

21:52.778 --> 21:55.746
I'm cold. I'm cold. I'm really cold.

21:55.748 --> 21:58.582
- Ayo?
- Body temp is 98.6, steady.

21:58.584 --> 22:01.252
- (Panting)
- You're not cold.

22:03.822 --> 22:06.524
- She's going into shock.
- This is why we do psychological testing.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.626
- Yes, that worked so well for Marta.
- I'm bouncing her.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.694
We need to know where
the other two bombs are.

22:10.696 --> 22:14.164
Kirsten, slow your breathing down.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.233
<i>Really try. Otherwise
we have to bounce you.</i>

22:17.869 --> 22:20.204
Kirsten: I thought I had to do that.

22:20.206 --> 22:23.774
But after that, you're gonna
have to make the bounce yourself.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.310
- And if I can't?
- We can still do it for you,

22:26.312 --> 22:29.346
but your consciousness won't like
being yanked out when it's not ready.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.582
It leaves a mark, a bad one.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.219
<i>Slow your breathing down.</i>

22:42.193 --> 22:44.495
- Linus: <i>We should bounce her.
- Is that Linus?</i>

22:44.497 --> 22:45.963
Yeah, he thinks we should bounce you.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.965
Just tell him to shut the hell up.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.301
Hey, I think she likes you.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.269
Fine, we won't bounce you as long as you

22:52.271 --> 22:54.939
calm yourself down. Can you do that for me?

23:00.812 --> 23:03.380
She's stabilizing.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.450
Hey, much better.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.386
Much better.

23:19.898 --> 23:23.000
Am I really still back in
the lab, in the fish tank?

23:23.002 --> 23:24.535
Yep.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.573
Dressed like Catwoman?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.709
Without the cat ears and stilettos,

23:31.711 --> 23:34.244
but for the most part, yeah.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.981
Brandt: I told you... time is my point.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.450
Woman: You wouldn't understand.
This is my life's work.

23:39.452 --> 23:40.951
Brandt: I do understand.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.820
Julie!

23:42.822 --> 23:44.588
Okay.

23:44.590 --> 23:46.390
What do you want me to do?

23:46.392 --> 23:48.926
Take a walk around the
apartment. Check it out.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.596
And what am I looking for?

23:52.598 --> 23:55.332
<i>Scraps of paper with
addresses on them,</i>

23:55.334 --> 23:57.334
<i>pictures of buildings or places... </i>

23:57.336 --> 24:02.039
<i>something that's gotta tell us
where those other two bombs are.</i>

24:02.041 --> 24:04.475
<i>(Dial tones beeping)</i>

24:04.477 --> 24:06.076
I hear something.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.446
Follow it.

24:14.586 --> 24:17.488
Uh, there's a door, but I can't open it.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.723
You're a consciousness
now, not physical matter.

24:19.725 --> 24:21.725
You have to will it to open.

24:31.536 --> 24:33.470
I'm in.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.806
<i>(Dial tones beeping)</i>

25:14.079 --> 25:17.614
Man: Signal is failing. Signal is failing.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.983
- Cameron.
- I see it.

25:21.486 --> 25:23.687
I don't understand it, but I see it.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.557
- What is happening?
- Her E.E.G. is off the chart.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.392
It's like her brain's
in freakin' overdrive.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.527
Julie: This is it.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.763
- This is it.
- You made this?

25:34.466 --> 25:36.500
Brandt: <i>You're gonna
save so many lives.</i>

25:37.469 --> 25:39.002
Julie Malarek.

25:39.004 --> 25:41.004
- Linus.
- Checking.

25:41.006 --> 25:44.141
- They're taking it from me.
- No, they can't.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.410
They did.

25:46.412 --> 25:50.581
They're stealing it from me,
and nobody is stopping them!

25:52.650 --> 25:55.953
<i>(Heart monitor beeping rapidly)</i>

25:55.955 --> 25:58.489
- Linus.
- Julie Malarek.

25:58.491 --> 26:00.824
She died three months ago, a
traffic accident of some kind.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.629
- It's all your fault.
- She's gone, pal.

26:05.631 --> 26:07.431
- Somebody help me.
- It's all your fault.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.973
(Gasps)

26:27.018 --> 26:30.154
<i>(Dial tones beeping)</i>

26:55.680 --> 26:59.216
(Beeping)

26:59.218 --> 27:00.851
Oh, no.

27:04.589 --> 27:06.690
- (People exclaim)
- Man: Whoa, come on.

27:18.570 --> 27:21.471
Hey, are you okay, Rocky?

27:21.473 --> 27:23.941
You were wrong. The
bomb in his apartment...

27:23.943 --> 27:26.076
it wasn't an accident.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.479
My head's beginning to hurt.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.114
Her cerebral temp is rising.

27:31.116 --> 27:33.083
Linus: <i>Brandt's memory
is beginning to collapse.</i>

27:33.085 --> 27:35.185
- Sub-bio, boost the A.T.P.
- We're at maximum.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.655
Not to alarm you, Princess, but
Brandt's brain is collapsing,

27:38.657 --> 27:41.158
which is a very bad thing.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.161
Yeah, I can see it happening.

27:44.163 --> 27:47.164
- You gotta bounce now.
- Cerebral temperature is 103.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.166
Total memory collapse in 14 seconds.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.635
- First name.
- 10 seconds.

27:51.637 --> 27:54.071
And now your exit pin code.

27:54.073 --> 27:57.140
iheartlinus.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.209
- Yeah, you do.
- Make the bounce!

28:03.014 --> 28:05.682
Okay, just relax while
we take off the restrai...

28:05.684 --> 28:08.120
- Ayo: Okay, hold up.
- Cameron, that anomaly just shocked...

28:08.121 --> 28:08.992
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.589
Kristen, are you okay?

28:19.230 --> 28:21.164
Blue door.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.000
Sepulveda.

28:31.309 --> 28:33.610
I'm so sorry,

28:33.612 --> 28:35.279
Julie.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.621
<i>* get in mind *</i>

28:44.623 --> 28:47.691
<i>* now often you won't let it up *</i>

28:47.693 --> 28:50.060
<i>* feeling tired *</i>

28:50.062 --> 28:52.796
<i>* gets in my bones through the night *</i>

28:52.798 --> 28:55.132
<i>* while I'm awake... *</i>

28:55.134 --> 28:57.000
Oh my god.

28:57.002 --> 28:59.736
<i>* I cannot say, it's odd to be nervous *</i>

28:59.738 --> 29:02.139
<i>* to leave my love at your gate *</i>

29:02.141 --> 29:06.176
<i>* so don't hold back *</i>

29:06.178 --> 29:08.111
<i>* and I'll get to greeting you... *</i>

29:08.113 --> 29:10.681
<i>(coffee grinder buzzing)</i>

29:15.653 --> 29:18.221
Oh. You're up.

29:18.223 --> 29:20.223
How are you feeling?

29:20.225 --> 29:21.858
Like I got hit by a bus.

29:21.860 --> 29:23.226
Fantastic. You hungry?

29:23.228 --> 29:25.128
I made us some kale,
tarragon breakfast smoothies.

29:25.130 --> 29:27.631
- Whose bed did I just wake up in?
- Mine.

29:27.633 --> 29:29.733
- And where did you sleep?
- Right next to you.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.202
- Ow!
- Ow!

29:32.204 --> 29:35.305
- I was unconscious, you pig.
- Get over yourself.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.374
For the record, I slept
on top of the sheets.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.042
I was babysitting you to
make sure you were okay.

29:39.044 --> 29:41.078
So how did I get into these pajamas?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.680
Ayo from the lab changed you.
She helped bring you here.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.084
I don't remember any of that.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.753
Do you remember

29:49.755 --> 29:51.955
anything from after the stitch,

29:51.957 --> 29:54.224
like... kissing me?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.392
I kissed you?

29:55.394 --> 29:57.027
You don't have to say it like that.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.696
I don't know what happened.

29:59.698 --> 30:03.367
I was just very... affected

30:03.369 --> 30:05.068
by being in Brandt's memory.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.372
Yeah, apparently.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.374
Well, if it makes you feel better,

30:10.376 --> 30:13.677
- I don't feel like kissing you now.
- Mm-hmm, much better.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.213
Drink your sludge and get dressed.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.215
We're wanted back at the lab.

30:20.651 --> 30:22.753
Mm, it's good.

30:22.755 --> 30:24.755
Good morning.

30:24.757 --> 30:27.357
While the two of you were
having a little sleepover,

30:27.359 --> 30:29.893
I decided to search all
the social media sites.

30:29.895 --> 30:31.497
Julie Malarek and Peter Brandt met

30:31.500 --> 30:34.297
while they were grad
students at U.C. Santa Monica.

30:34.299 --> 30:36.733
Now by all accounts,
they were a happy couple.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.436
But then three months ago she
died when she got hit by a bus.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.838
I saw it happen. She walked
away from Peter upset.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.875
She said something about someone
stealing something from her.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.877
Julie majored in electrical engineering

30:46.879 --> 30:49.279
with an emphasis on holography.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.014
You guys see where I'm going with this?

30:51.016 --> 30:52.949
Applied holographics. The second bomb.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.951
Bingo.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.254
That's the building she came
from right before she died.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.189
<i>She was furious, out of her mind.</i>

30:59.191 --> 31:02.125
If Applied Holographics
stole Julie's research,

31:02.127 --> 31:04.861
maybe Brandt blamed them for her
death and was getting revenge.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.363
There are two more bombs. Where are they?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.398
Stitch me back into Brandt's
memory and I'll find them.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.134
That's no longer an option. Brandt's
brain has hit its "best by" date.

31:11.136 --> 31:12.836
Yeah, he's done.

31:18.876 --> 31:20.844
Sepulveda, a blue door...

31:20.846 --> 31:22.345
<i>I saw both during the stitch.</i>

31:22.347 --> 31:23.880
It meant something to Peter.

31:23.882 --> 31:25.482
What was the emotion?

31:25.484 --> 31:28.151
I don't know, but it was strong.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.887
I've had two teams searching
all of Sepulveda Boulevard

31:30.889 --> 31:33.423
since last night looking for
blue doors. So far... nothing.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.325
Well, then they're doing it wrong.

31:35.327 --> 31:37.828
Sepulveda boulevard is 43 miles long.

31:37.830 --> 31:39.496
You think you can search faster?

31:39.498 --> 31:42.866
Actually, I wouldn't mind
doing some field work.

31:42.868 --> 31:45.869
The agency has people
who handle the field work.

31:45.871 --> 31:48.772
Unsocialized nerds and girls
in cat suits need not apply.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.307
Okay, I was just saying.

31:50.309 --> 31:52.876
Cameron: Look, we don't even
know how accurate this memory is.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.845
Brandt's brain was so
degraded and concussed,

31:54.847 --> 31:56.980
it could have been a mixture of
thoughts and ideas from anywhere...

31:56.982 --> 31:59.416
a book he read, a cartoon
he watched when he was five.

31:59.418 --> 32:03.019
No, the memory was real
and emotionally charged.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.457
I'll do it myself.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.893
- Kirsten.
- Told you.

32:09.895 --> 32:12.262
(Sighs) Smartass.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.836
Kirsten, Kirsten.

32:19.838 --> 32:23.039
The Stitchers program is
as clandestine as they come.

32:23.041 --> 32:25.108
We don't stray outside our mandate, ever.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.477
If you get caught
someplace you don't belong,

32:27.479 --> 32:30.247
the agency will swoop in
and disappear all of us.

32:30.249 --> 32:32.816
And I'm too old to do a stint in Gitmo.

32:33.551 --> 32:35.552
I'm not.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.926
Still not a fan of psychological testing?

32:46.797 --> 32:48.798
Deal with this.

32:56.307 --> 32:58.542
Kirsten, wait.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.944
We have to find that blue door.

33:00.946 --> 33:03.013
Okay, you heard Maggie.
There's two teams on it already.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.348
Yeah, two ineffectual teams.
There are two more bombs to find.

33:05.350 --> 33:06.983
I can do this so much faster.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.986
Oh, come on, Cameron. You
asked me to trust you and I did.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.088
Now I'm asking you to trust me.

33:13.157 --> 33:15.859
Lives are at stake. You said so yourself.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.596
All right, ace, what's your plan?

33:23.100 --> 33:24.601
Good, you're here.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.003
It's about time you
came back for your stuff.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.272
I was just about to
burn it in the backyard.

33:29.274 --> 33:33.977
Oh my god, this is all part of
your delusional whatever, isn't it?

33:33.979 --> 33:36.947
Listen, I don't know you, but I know her.

33:36.949 --> 33:39.082
Get out of here before I tase both of you.

33:39.084 --> 33:41.151
We work for a secret
government agency that hacks

33:41.153 --> 33:43.220
into the brains of corpses
and reads their memories.

33:43.222 --> 33:44.921
(Whispers) You have no
filter at all, do you?

33:44.923 --> 33:46.423
You know that bomber on the news?

33:46.425 --> 33:48.625
He died in an explosion,
and I read his memories.

33:48.627 --> 33:51.595
He's planted two more bombs, but the trained
monkeys at the agency can't find them.

33:51.597 --> 33:53.430
Trained monkeys? That's hurtful.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.565
But I can find them, if you help me.

33:57.301 --> 33:58.602
You guys don't really hack

33:58.604 --> 34:00.604
into dead people's brains
and read their memories.

34:00.606 --> 34:03.206
(Scoffs) Yeah.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.041
Look, we don't have a lot of time.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.448
I need to get into the
Caltech computer system.

34:06.450 --> 34:07.616
I need to run an image search

34:07.618 --> 34:09.351
for buildings on
Sepulveda with a blue door.

34:09.353 --> 34:11.687
Do you know how long Sepulveda is?

34:11.688 --> 34:14.322
Apparently 43 miles.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.092
But you know that face
recognition exploit I wrote?

34:17.094 --> 34:19.127
If I change four lines of
code, I can make it search

34:19.129 --> 34:20.929
for blue doors instead of faces.

34:20.931 --> 34:23.598
You still think I'm the
queen of <i>Estupidos?</i>

34:24.766 --> 34:26.935
- You said that?
- I haven't seen either of you

34:26.937 --> 34:30.906
do anything smart yet, so... yeah.

34:32.574 --> 34:34.676
Please be seated.

34:36.812 --> 34:38.612
Damn it.

34:38.614 --> 34:41.315
- Okay, are you sure you rewrote the code correctly?
- Yes.

34:41.318 --> 34:43.184
You ran it three times. There's no building

34:43.186 --> 34:44.920
with a blue door on Sepulveda Boulevard.

34:44.922 --> 34:46.588
(Kirsten clears throat)

34:47.956 --> 34:50.292
There has to be. I saw it.
It was in Brandt's memory.

34:50.293 --> 34:52.226
What if the blue door in Brandt's memory

34:52.228 --> 34:54.728
was a visual placeholder
for non-visual information?

34:56.264 --> 34:58.833
Double major in data retrieval systems.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.101
May I?

35:01.737 --> 35:05.774
Let's try Occam's razor.

35:05.776 --> 35:08.109
The simplest solution
is most often correct.

35:08.111 --> 35:10.045
So let's try a simple Boolean search...

35:10.047 --> 35:12.047
"blue door"

35:12.049 --> 35:14.683
plus "Sepulveda."

35:19.088 --> 35:21.189
What's that picture?

35:25.594 --> 35:27.595
- It's all your fault.
- She's gone, pal.

35:27.597 --> 35:29.030
- Help me.
- It's all your fault!

35:29.032 --> 35:33.668
"Jane Pica, Dean of the electrical
engineering program at U.C. Santa Monica

35:33.670 --> 35:36.004
- and president of Blue Door Consulting... "
- On Sepulveda Boulevard.

35:36.006 --> 35:37.706
"... Announcing the purchase

35:37.708 --> 35:39.774
of her holographic projection technology

35:39.776 --> 35:41.676
by Applied Holographics."

35:41.678 --> 35:45.080
Pica's the one who sold Julie's
research to Applied Holographics.

35:45.082 --> 35:46.881
And with the school's tech transfer rules,

35:46.883 --> 35:49.017
there's nothing Julie or
Peter could do to stop her.

35:49.019 --> 35:51.353
True, but Peter could get revenge.

35:51.355 --> 35:53.688
Where does this Jane Pica live?

35:54.690 --> 35:57.625
At 3:30. Can you do that?

35:57.627 --> 35:59.094
There she is.

35:59.096 --> 36:01.196
I'm still not convinced
this is a good idea.

36:01.198 --> 36:02.864
I am.

36:04.734 --> 36:06.468
For the love of Zod.

36:06.470 --> 36:08.970
Excuse me.

36:08.972 --> 36:11.306
- Jane Pica?
- Yeah.

36:15.011 --> 36:17.879
- <i>(Car alarms blaring)
- Man: Someone call 911.</i>

36:21.283 --> 36:23.418
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:23.420 --> 36:25.220
Please tell me there
wasn't anyone in there.

36:25.222 --> 36:26.721
No, nobody.

36:26.723 --> 36:29.758
There was a skinny guy at
Julie Malarek's funeral,

36:29.760 --> 36:31.993
short and thinning hair. We need a name.

36:31.995 --> 36:34.396
- My house.
- A word of advice...

36:34.398 --> 36:36.164
next time you steal someone's technology,

36:36.166 --> 36:38.199
make sure their boyfriend
wasn't a bomb-making genius.

36:38.201 --> 36:41.436
- What are you talking about?
- You stole Julie Malarek's research and sold it.

36:41.438 --> 36:43.371
- You killed her.
- That wasn't my fault.

36:43.373 --> 36:46.141
Yeah, tell that to your
unique fixer-upper here.

36:46.143 --> 36:48.710
The skinny guy at the funeral.

36:49.445 --> 36:51.721
Fred. Fred Castellano.

36:51.722 --> 36:52.891
Where can we find him?

36:52.895 --> 36:55.950
U.C. Santa Monica, the science building.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.752
Who are you people?

36:57.754 --> 36:59.220
Friends of Julie.

37:03.759 --> 37:06.227
So Castellano funnels
Julie's research to Pica,

37:06.229 --> 37:08.863
who sells it to applied
holographics for a small fortune.

37:08.865 --> 37:12.100
Pica got rich, Castellano got a
finder's fee, and Julie got screwed.

37:12.102 --> 37:13.835
And Brandt gets revenge.

37:13.837 --> 37:15.403
We've got to clear this building.

37:15.405 --> 37:17.472
If a bomb goes off in here,
it's gonna be a disaster.

37:17.474 --> 37:20.809
- <i>(Alarm ringing)
- Check out the testicles on Cameron.</i>

37:20.811 --> 37:22.310
Thank you.

37:22.312 --> 37:24.345
Fred Castellano.

37:24.347 --> 37:26.848
Room 230.

37:26.850 --> 37:28.249
Wait.

37:34.423 --> 37:37.158
Forget Castellano. The
bomb's in the basement.

37:42.765 --> 37:44.199
It's down here.

37:44.201 --> 37:46.201
(Fred yelling, muffled) Help! Help!

37:46.203 --> 37:48.002
<i>Help!</i>

37:50.306 --> 37:53.308
Holy big freakin' bomb, Batman.

37:53.310 --> 37:55.743
- (Muffled screams)
- (Timer beeping)

38:05.187 --> 38:08.790
- Thank god.
- We're gonna get you out of here, okay?

38:08.792 --> 38:10.358
No!

38:11.293 --> 38:13.394
It's a mercury tumbler switch.

38:13.396 --> 38:16.030
If it moves even a little,

38:16.032 --> 38:18.233
it will detonate the bomb.

38:18.235 --> 38:20.135
Okay, this officially sucks.

38:20.137 --> 38:22.137
I've been up for two days,

38:22.139 --> 38:23.938
staying so still.

38:25.174 --> 38:27.108
I can't do this anymore.

38:27.110 --> 38:30.078
Sure you can. We're gonna help you.

38:30.080 --> 38:32.914
I don't deserve to live. I'm sorry.

38:32.916 --> 38:34.549
Julie, I'm so sorry.

38:36.785 --> 38:40.355
The man with the motion-sensitive
detonator is sobbing.

38:40.357 --> 38:42.557
- Get out of here, Cameron.
- Sorry, cupcake,

38:42.559 --> 38:44.159
not without you.

38:45.461 --> 38:47.929
- Please.
- Cameron, you're smart.

38:47.931 --> 38:49.264
You can figure out how do defuse this.

38:49.266 --> 38:50.932
I harvest the memories of the dead.

38:50.934 --> 38:53.334
This requires a completely
different skill set.

38:54.970 --> 38:57.939
In the stitch, you said you heard

38:57.941 --> 39:00.508
cell phone tones?

39:00.510 --> 39:01.876
Yes.

39:01.878 --> 39:04.412
Yes, five... five of them.

39:04.414 --> 39:07.248
- What are you doing?
- Being someone with temporal dysplasia.

39:09.118 --> 39:11.419
<i>(Dial tones beeping rapidly)</i>

39:17.459 --> 39:19.561
Listen.

39:22.131 --> 39:24.098
(Dial tones beeping)

39:27.503 --> 39:29.837
- Cell phone.
- Here.

39:31.540 --> 39:33.975
Okay.

39:35.411 --> 39:38.012
It's 5-8-5-4-3.

39:38.981 --> 39:40.081
Of course.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.284
No!

39:51.994 --> 39:53.328
Oh.

40:01.503 --> 40:03.438
It spelled "Julie."

40:14.149 --> 40:16.117
Police!

40:18.320 --> 40:19.654
Easy, Detective.

40:19.656 --> 40:21.956
We're the good guys.

40:24.260 --> 40:28.896
I was... there was... I
was holding the thing...

40:29.932 --> 40:32.967
Looks like it's all clear.

40:32.969 --> 40:35.603
Okay, Miss Clark, what the
hell really happened in there?

40:35.605 --> 40:37.438
I told you. We were studying.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.307
We heard a noise in the
basement and we checked it out.

40:39.309 --> 40:41.909
- And then defused a bomb?
- It's actually not that hard to do

40:41.911 --> 40:44.045
- once you figure out a few ba...
- Shut up.

40:44.047 --> 40:46.648
Fine, you two want to play?

40:46.650 --> 40:48.483
That's fine. We'll play.

40:48.485 --> 40:51.152
- You're under arrest.
- Maggie: No, they're not.

40:53.222 --> 40:54.989
N.S.A.?

40:54.991 --> 40:56.924
Ish.

40:59.361 --> 41:01.262
We did everything we were supposed to do.

41:01.264 --> 41:03.631
We found the bombs, saved
who knows how many people?

41:03.633 --> 41:05.700
The agency probably
thinks we're superstars.

41:05.702 --> 41:08.603
The agency is considering yanking
our funding because of you two.

41:08.605 --> 41:10.471
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

41:10.473 --> 41:12.473
Unfortunately for that point of view,

41:12.475 --> 41:15.009
I have convinced them to
give us another chance.

41:15.011 --> 41:16.944
I assured them that this is a rookie error

41:16.946 --> 41:19.580
and from now on we're going
to stick to our mandate...

41:19.582 --> 41:22.283
inside work only, very inside.

41:22.285 --> 41:23.518
Am I clear?

41:24.453 --> 41:25.987
Clear?

41:25.989 --> 41:28.323
I didn't want to be
here in the first place.

41:32.961 --> 41:34.962
What, I suppose you want me to... ?

41:34.964 --> 41:36.597
Fine.

41:39.201 --> 41:41.169
Wait. Kirsten.

41:41.171 --> 41:43.471
The thing about being stitched...

41:43.473 --> 41:46.708
it made me feel things
I've never felt before.

41:46.710 --> 41:49.344
When I was a little girl, I had to learn

41:49.346 --> 41:52.747
how to identify emotions by
flash cards of human faces.

41:52.749 --> 41:55.616
But this time I felt
them, and they were real.

41:55.618 --> 41:57.652
Now I know what grief feels like.

41:57.654 --> 41:59.654
Now I know what anger feels like.

41:59.656 --> 42:03.157
I might even know what love feels like.

42:03.159 --> 42:06.094
I'm not a fan. I'm out.

42:06.096 --> 42:07.795
That's too bad. We've been asked

42:07.797 --> 42:09.664
to look into the death
of a research scientist,

42:09.666 --> 42:13.000
and we've only got 48 hours
before his memories collapse.

42:13.002 --> 42:15.470
He and his partner developed
the Stitchers technology.

42:15.472 --> 42:17.305
His name was Ed Clark.

42:20.376 --> 42:23.277
The agency isn't convinced
that he killed himself.

42:23.279 --> 42:25.079
I know he didn't.

42:28.484 --> 42:30.518
Who was his partner?

42:30.520 --> 42:32.620
Dr. Daniel Stinger.

42:37.092 --> 42:39.193
Your father.

42:40.262 --> 42:42.063
I'm in.
