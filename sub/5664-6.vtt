ZOE:

00:29.291 --> 00:30.958
Wow.

00:30.958 --> 00:33.625
He is fast with that blade.

00:30.958 --> 00:33.625
Mmm.

00:33.625 --> 00:36.333
The technique makes for

00:33.625 --> 00:36.333
excellent theater, but in

00:36.333 --> 00:37.875
actual combat,

00:36.333 --> 00:37.875
he would be bested

00:37.875 --> 00:41.625
by the most rudimentary

00:37.875 --> 00:41.625
rapier skills. Oh, uh,

speaking of skills,

00:41.625 --> 00:45.333
what secret skills

00:45.333 --> 00:46.166

(diners gasping in awe,

00:47.750 --> 00:48.750
laughing)

00:48.750 --> 00:50.250
Sorry. What?

00:50.250 --> 00:51.750
Uh...

00:51.750 --> 00:54.250
what was your

00:51.750 --> 00:54.250

"20 Questions

01:02.625 --> 01:04.666
to Ask on a First Date"?

01:07.625 --> 01:11.583
I see we both walk the

01:07.625 --> 01:11.583
same Internet paths.

01:11.583 --> 01:12.541
My apologies.

01:12.541 --> 01:14.250
None needed.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.791
We were both nervous

01:14.250 --> 01:16.791
about tonight.

01:16.791 --> 01:18.208
In a good way.

01:18.208 --> 01:20.208
The truth is

01:20.208 --> 01:22.958
it has been some time since...

01:22.958 --> 01:26.125
Things are so very

01:22.958 --> 01:26.125
different now.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.375
You two lovebirds

01:32.333 --> 01:34.375
on a date?

01:34.375 --> 01:37.208
No. Well, well... yes.

01:34.375 --> 01:37.208
Oh...

01:43.208 --> 01:44.750
I've been accosted

01:43.208 --> 01:44.750
by a highwayman.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.041

Got a sec?

01:57.583 --> 01:59.625
Absolutely. Nice tie.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.625
Thanks.

02:00.625 --> 02:02.583
I got a thing tonight.

02:03.958 --> 02:04.958
Don't eyebrow me.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.541
It's a work thing.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.041
I like it anyway.

02:09.041 --> 02:10.916
You're wondering

02:09.041 --> 02:10.916
if I spoke to my sister

02:10.916 --> 02:12.708
about the Nevins investigation.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.000
I said I would take care of it.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.000
I don't doubt

02:14.000 --> 02:16.333
that you will. But you mentioned

02:14.000 --> 02:16.333
a family matter,

02:16.333 --> 02:18.041
and sometimes

02:16.333 --> 02:18.041
the personal may

02:18.041 --> 02:19.333
jam up the professional.

02:19.333 --> 02:20.458
Danny, I get it.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.833
Nevins is a criminal,

02:21.833 --> 02:23.708
and you're gonna

02:21.833 --> 02:23.708
use him to bag even

02:23.708 --> 02:26.541
bigger bad guys.

02:23.708 --> 02:26.541
Nothing gets in the way of that.

02:26.541 --> 02:29.041
Good. 'Cause the ducks I had

02:26.541 --> 02:29.041
to line up on this one--

02:29.041 --> 02:31.291
Homeland Security, NSA--

02:31.291 --> 02:33.708
I had to pull 31 flavors

02:31.291 --> 02:33.708
of favors on this.

02:33.708 --> 02:34.791
Asset's in motion.

02:33.708 --> 02:34.791
This is the one

02:34.791 --> 02:36.333
that puts you on the map.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.541
Hell, I land this,

02:36.333 --> 02:38.541
I own the map.

02:38.541 --> 02:39.833
I sit down with Jenny and Joe

02:38.541 --> 02:39.833
tonight.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.666
So do not worry.

02:41.666 --> 02:43.666
Good luck

02:43.666 --> 02:44.666
with your thing.

03:07.125 --> 03:10.666
It's all so close.

03:10.666 --> 03:13.750
I can feel it.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.875
The last flower.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.875
A flavor of fear,

03:18.875 --> 03:22.791
both sweet and bitter.

03:22.791 --> 03:24.583
For this,

03:24.583 --> 03:28.500
I require

03:24.583 --> 03:28.500
a most skilled emissary.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.750
(speaking in foreign language)

03:37.583 --> 03:42.875
There is a red lady from Caribee

03:42.875 --> 03:45.291
whose sting

03:45.291 --> 03:48.666
brings the nightmare, insanity.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.833
(buzzing)

03:55.583 --> 03:58.708
One kiss and you'll flee

03:58.708 --> 04:00.666
most all you can see.

04:00.666 --> 04:05.750
This comely red lady

04:05.750 --> 04:07.958
from Caribee.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.750
Welcome, my lady.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.875
Bring me the final bloom I need.

04:16.875 --> 04:20.375
The fear

04:20.375 --> 04:24.291
of fear itself.

04:33.666 --> 04:36.708
(quietly sniffs, sighs)

04:40.625 --> 04:43.500
(buzzing)

04:53.750 --> 04:57.750
Easy there, little fella.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.166
(buzzing)

04:59.166 --> 05:00.625
(rattling)

05:00.625 --> 05:02.500
(buzzing)

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
Ow! Son of a... mm!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.416
Go away! Get out of here!

05:06.416 --> 05:08.208
(groans)

05:08.208 --> 05:11.750
(distant buzzing)

05:16.541 --> 05:18.541
(buzzing)

05:23.041 --> 05:24.541
Go.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.333
No, no, no!

05:26.333 --> 05:27.708
(shouting)

05:30.958 --> 05:32.958
ABBIE:

05:30.958 --> 05:32.958
You drew a lucky straw

05:30.958 --> 05:32.958
on this one, Crane.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.958
How so?

05:32.958 --> 05:35.958
Judge Chrysdale

05:32.958 --> 05:35.958
is a history buff.

05:35.958 --> 05:38.500
Loves anything to do

05:35.958 --> 05:38.500
with the Revolution,

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
Civil War, so on.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.500
You quote a little Jefferson,

05:41.500 --> 05:43.166
uh, offer your apologies,

05:43.166 --> 05:45.375
the whole immigration

05:43.166 --> 05:45.375
snafu goes away.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.583
Fine. But the charges

05:45.375 --> 05:47.583
made against me

05:47.583 --> 05:49.458
remain a farce, Lieutenant.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.458
Flagged as a risk

05:49.458 --> 05:52.458
to national security.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.583
For transporting

05:52.458 --> 05:55.583
my own property.

05:52.458 --> 05:55.583
You smuggled ancient artifacts

05:55.583 --> 05:56.875
into the country and got caught.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.500
This guy is-is-is

05:56.875 --> 05:59.500
very straightforward.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.250
You just play the hits and be

05:59.500 --> 06:01.250
charming, we'll get out of here

06:01.250 --> 06:03.625
by lunch, at which time you

06:01.250 --> 06:03.625
can tell me all about your...

06:03.625 --> 06:05.375
date with Zoe last night.

06:05.375 --> 06:06.666
There's nothing to tell

06:06.666 --> 06:09.083
except it was

06:06.666 --> 06:09.083
an unmitigated disaster.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.083
Mmm.

06:10.083 --> 06:12.416
What of your Agent Reynolds?

06:12.416 --> 06:14.125
We're fine. And he's not mine.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.625
He must be aware

06:14.125 --> 06:16.625
that you had no way of knowing

06:16.625 --> 06:20.375
that Miss Jenny and Master Joe's

06:16.625 --> 06:20.375
query into Sheriff Corbin's past

06:20.375 --> 06:22.625
would intersect with

06:20.375 --> 06:22.625
a federal investigation.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.958
Yeah, that's on me.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.958
Danny and I are friends,

06:24.958 --> 06:27.458
but professional courtesy

06:24.958 --> 06:27.458
has limits. I respect that.

06:27.458 --> 06:30.750
And what if you were

06:27.458 --> 06:30.750
more than friends?

06:27.458 --> 06:30.750
Well, that would be complicated.

06:30.750 --> 06:33.250
But that's all that we are,

06:30.750 --> 06:33.250
so it's not.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.625
He's crazy.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.625
He's-he's lost his mind.

06:36.625 --> 06:38.625
Isn't that your lawyer, Crane?

06:38.625 --> 06:40.916
Yes.

06:40.916 --> 06:43.958
(murmuring,

06:40.916 --> 06:43.958
indistinct conversations)

06:45.958 --> 06:48.833
CHRYSDALE:

06:45.958 --> 06:48.833
When I say "order,"

06:45.958 --> 06:48.833
I mean order!

06:48.833 --> 06:52.750
This is my courtroom.

06:48.833 --> 06:52.750
No one leaves!

06:54.166 --> 06:55.833
Brenda, next case.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.833
Your Honor,

06:55.833 --> 06:57.833
perhaps a short

06:57.833 --> 06:59.916
recess before you hear

06:57.833 --> 06:59.916
opening arguments?

06:59.916 --> 07:02.166
Don't tell me

06:59.916 --> 07:02.166
how to run my courtroom!

07:02.166 --> 07:04.125
Proceed.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.250
There's

07:04.125 --> 07:05.250
a criminal element here,

07:05.250 --> 07:06.708
and it needs

07:05.250 --> 07:06.708
to be torn out

07:06.708 --> 07:07.541
by the root.

07:07.541 --> 07:10.708
Sir, are you feeling okay?

07:10.708 --> 07:12.708
Are you challenging

07:10.708 --> 07:12.708
my authority?

07:12.708 --> 07:13.708
I am on the side

07:12.708 --> 07:13.708
of right!

07:13.708 --> 07:15.208
This man is clearly mad.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.458
There's something very wrong

07:15.208 --> 07:17.458
with him.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.083
We need to get

07:17.458 --> 07:19.083
everyone out of here.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
WOMAN:

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
Judge, you need a doctor.

07:20.291 --> 07:21.625
CHRYSDALE:

07:20.291 --> 07:21.625
Bailiff,

07:21.625 --> 07:23.875
this woman is threatening...

07:21.625 --> 07:23.875
Leave now.

07:23.875 --> 07:26.041
the sanctity of this bench.

07:23.875 --> 07:26.041
CRANE: Very quickly.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.541
Draw your weapon

07:26.041 --> 07:27.541
and eliminate her.

07:27.541 --> 07:28.583
What?

07:28.583 --> 07:29.916
Sir?

07:28.583 --> 07:29.916
I said shoot her!

07:29.916 --> 07:32.250
My name is Ichabod Crane

07:32.250 --> 07:33.625
for the defense.

07:33.625 --> 07:34.916
Whilst I hold

07:33.625 --> 07:34.916
your office

07:34.916 --> 07:37.708
in the highest esteem, I fear,

07:37.708 --> 07:39.625
in your current condition,

07:37.708 --> 07:39.625
you may not be able

07:39.625 --> 07:41.208
to uphold the law.

07:41.208 --> 07:43.458
This isn't the law.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.458
The whole system

07:44.458 --> 07:46.000
is filled with liars,

07:46.000 --> 07:47.625
people trying to...

07:47.625 --> 07:51.458
(buzzing)

07:47.625 --> 07:51.458
manipulate the law,

07:47.625 --> 07:51.458
to manipulate me,

07:51.458 --> 07:53.541
undermining my authority,

07:53.541 --> 07:54.875
trying to make me

07:54.875 --> 07:56.875
weak. You can't

07:56.875 --> 07:58.416
trust anyone.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.708
(moans, gasps)

08:06.666 --> 08:08.666
Judge Chrysdale?!

08:14.416 --> 08:16.166
CRANE:

08:14.416 --> 08:16.166
What happened to this man?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.666
Whatever it is, it killed him.

08:21.666 --> 08:25.083
After driving him mad.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.958
The woman.

08:27.958 --> 08:30.541
Which woman?

08:32.708 --> 08:35.541
Whatever she was,

08:35.541 --> 08:38.666
I fear the foul creature

08:35.541 --> 08:38.666
is far from done.

09:17.583 --> 09:18.750
Damn, I thought I cleared

09:17.583 --> 09:18.750
that location for cameras.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.083
You're good. So is Reynolds.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.750
So he's coming down hard

09:21.083 --> 09:22.750
on Nevins?

09:22.750 --> 09:25.250
I can't tell you the details.

09:25.250 --> 09:26.750
But yes and soon.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.750
So...

09:28.750 --> 09:31.583
it's over. Okay?

09:31.583 --> 09:33.583
Doesn't sound

09:31.583 --> 09:33.583
like you're giving me a choice.

09:33.583 --> 09:36.708
Look, I want to know what the

09:33.583 --> 09:36.708
connection was between Corbin

09:36.708 --> 09:39.333
and Nevins as bad

09:36.708 --> 09:39.333
as you do.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.625
Nevins is dangerous.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.625
Corbin was our mentor.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.291
And Joe's father.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.625
He is not gonna be happy

09:44.583 --> 09:46.625
about this.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.791
I'll talk to him.

09:48.791 --> 09:50.708
No, I'll do it.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.125
We started this whole thing

09:50.708 --> 09:53.125
together, I think it's...

09:53.125 --> 09:55.625
best if we finish

09:53.125 --> 09:55.625
it the same way.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.916
It's good

09:55.625 --> 09:58.916
that you tried to help.

09:58.916 --> 10:02.208
Tell me how it goes.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.583
♪ I see a lot of love

10:02.208 --> 10:04.583
in your heart... ♪

10:08.125 --> 10:10.541
CRANE:

10:08.125 --> 10:10.541
I found this insect

10:10.541 --> 10:13.083
near the judge's bench.

10:10.541 --> 10:13.083
At first I thought the swarm

10:13.083 --> 10:15.500
we witnessed was made of bees,

10:13.083 --> 10:15.500
but the distinct coloration

10:15.500 --> 10:19.208
and long antenna mark this

10:15.500 --> 10:19.208
as a Jack Spaniard,

10:19.208 --> 10:22.583
a genus of wasp

10:19.208 --> 10:22.583
exclusive to the Caribbean.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.625
Has a hell of a sting.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.500
Preliminary coroner's report

10:24.625 --> 10:27.500
says that Judge Chrysdale

10:27.500 --> 10:29.458
died of an extreme

10:27.500 --> 10:29.458
brain aneurysm.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.708
The swarm is deadly...

10:29.458 --> 10:31.708
Mm-hmm.

10:31.708 --> 10:34.208
and I believe,

10:31.708 --> 10:34.208
harbinger of a great evil.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.083
The thing that you saw

10:34.208 --> 10:36.083
in the courtroom--

10:36.083 --> 10:38.541
you said that it took on

10:36.083 --> 10:38.541
a... almost human shape.

10:38.541 --> 10:43.083
Yes. My research marks

10:38.541 --> 10:43.083
it as a demonic creature

10:43.083 --> 10:48.416
of Trinidadian origin,

10:43.083 --> 10:48.416
known as a Soucouyant.

10:48.416 --> 10:52.041
One sting from a Jack Spaniard

10:48.416 --> 10:52.041
in her swarm sparks a fever,

10:52.041 --> 10:54.791
bringing with it paranoia

10:52.041 --> 10:54.791
that grows in ferocity until

10:54.791 --> 10:58.166
death overcomes.

10:54.791 --> 10:58.166
The judge was ranting

10:54.791 --> 10:58.166
about a loss of order.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.708
A man you said was fair

10:58.166 --> 11:00.708
and even-keeled.

11:00.708 --> 11:04.291
There is a passage

11:00.708 --> 11:04.291
in Grace Dixon's journal

11:04.291 --> 11:09.083
referencing a fit of paranoia

11:04.291 --> 11:09.083
suffered by your pal Washington.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.041
General Washington?

11:09.083 --> 11:11.041
Paranoid. No.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.041
Mm.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.750
Yes. December 1776,

11:12.750 --> 11:14.916
the Colonial troops

11:12.750 --> 11:14.916
were camped out

11:14.916 --> 11:17.250
in Pennsylvania

11:14.916 --> 11:17.250
after a harsh winter.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.125
Ah. "I was summoned by a woman

11:19.125 --> 11:21.666
"of exceeding bravery

11:19.125 --> 11:21.666
and fortitude.

11:21.666 --> 11:23.708
"A former seamstress

11:21.666 --> 11:23.708
who became

11:23.708 --> 11:25.916
Washington's most trusted

11:23.708 --> 11:25.916
wartime operative."

11:25.916 --> 11:28.500
Betsy Ross.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.875
Your ancestor and my trusted

11:28.500 --> 11:30.875
companion knew one another?

11:30.875 --> 11:32.916
No name's given,

11:30.875 --> 11:32.916
but it does sound like her.

11:32.916 --> 11:35.083
Well, read on, Lieutenant.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.833
(grunting)

11:36.833 --> 11:38.666
ABBIE:  "I entered the camp

11:36.833 --> 11:38.666
to find it gripped

11:38.666 --> 11:40.458
by a pall of fear

11:38.666 --> 11:40.458
and paranoia."

11:42.750 --> 11:45.250
Miss Dixon?

11:45.250 --> 11:46.708
Your reputation precedes you.

11:46.708 --> 11:47.958
As does yours.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.375
I hope I'm not too late.

11:49.375 --> 11:51.041
You placed these

11:49.375 --> 11:51.041
to ward off the evil

11:51.041 --> 11:52.500
that threatens this camp?

11:52.500 --> 11:54.833
A folk remedy

11:52.500 --> 11:54.833
to keep insects at bay.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.875
Tea tree oil,

11:54.833 --> 11:56.875
cucumber peel, cinnamon...

11:56.875 --> 11:58.458
...vanilla and citronella.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.291
Yes, I, uh, know it well.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.333
Sadly, it was too little,

12:00.291 --> 12:02.333
too late.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.625
Come.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.500
Please tell me you can help him.

12:16.916 --> 12:20.250
Oh, the sting

12:16.916 --> 12:20.250
of a Soucouyant is fatal

12:20.250 --> 12:22.416
within ten hours of being stung.

12:22.416 --> 12:23.958
But I've learned of a bit

12:23.958 --> 12:25.583
of Trinidadian Obeah.

12:25.583 --> 12:27.250
Herbs that will slow the effect

12:27.250 --> 12:30.375
of the sting.

12:27.250 --> 12:30.375
I brewed up a tonic. (sighs)

12:34.958 --> 12:36.750
(gasps)

12:34.958 --> 12:36.750
Don't touch me.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.541
General Washington,

12:36.750 --> 12:39.541
Miss Dixon is here

12:39.541 --> 12:40.625
to tend to your discomfort.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.125
I'd sooner let her slit

12:40.625 --> 12:43.125
my throat.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.250
If you have any sanity left,

12:43.125 --> 12:45.250
General,

12:45.250 --> 12:48.750
I entreat you to

12:45.250 --> 12:48.750
take this medicine.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.083
General Howe must have

12:51.583 --> 12:54.083
brought this evil upon us.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.750
The tonic will slow the fever.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.333
(gasps)

12:56.750 --> 12:59.333
The only cure

12:59.333 --> 13:01.541
is the death of the

12:59.333 --> 13:01.541
creature that infected him.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.541
BETSY:

13:08.041 --> 13:09.541
You've done your part.

13:09.541 --> 13:11.208
It's time I did mine.

13:13.708 --> 13:16.125
CRANE:

13:13.708 --> 13:16.125
Betsy must have found a way

13:13.708 --> 13:16.125
to dispose of the Soucouyant.

13:16.125 --> 13:20.208
But how? And what of this tonic

13:20.208 --> 13:22.208
Miss Dixon used to buy

13:20.208 --> 13:22.208
the general more time?

13:22.208 --> 13:24.625
There's nothing else

13:22.208 --> 13:24.625
in the passage except this.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.500
"When comes the beauty

13:27.208 --> 13:30.500
from Caribee,

13:30.500 --> 13:32.583
"she spends her time

13:30.500 --> 13:32.583
in Port of Spain,

13:32.583 --> 13:35.166
"watching foul flies

13:32.583 --> 13:35.166
roost in the spice tree

13:35.166 --> 13:39.166
under which Sir Chadwick prays

13:35.166 --> 13:39.166
on bended knee."

13:39.166 --> 13:43.583
What the hell does that mean?

13:39.166 --> 13:43.583
Uh... a Caribbean nursery

13:39.166 --> 13:43.583
rhyme? Or a riddle.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.083
(phone ringing)

13:43.583 --> 13:45.083
Or...

13:45.083 --> 13:46.583
perhaps a cipher hidden within.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.541
Agent Mills here.

13:48.541 --> 13:50.125
REYNOLDS:

13:48.541 --> 13:50.125
Abs, we got a second

13:48.541 --> 13:50.125
suspicious death.

13:50.125 --> 13:51.583
Head of the PTA killed

13:50.125 --> 13:51.583
inside her kitchen.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.250
I need you over here

13:51.583 --> 13:54.250
right away.

13:51.583 --> 13:54.250
On my way.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.208
It seems the creature

13:54.250 --> 13:56.208
struck again.

13:56.208 --> 14:00.583
Figure out what this means.

13:56.208 --> 14:00.583
I'm gonna go check this out.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.458
REYNOLDS:

14:00.583 --> 14:02.458
Whatever happened

14:00.583 --> 14:02.458
to this woman

14:02.458 --> 14:03.916
is too damn similar

14:02.458 --> 14:03.916
to that judge.

14:03.916 --> 14:06.708
You think it's some kind of

14:06.708 --> 14:08.625
toxin or virus?

14:06.708 --> 14:08.625
That's for the lab coats.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.708
I have a call into CDC.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.708
Until then,

14:10.708 --> 14:12.625
we monitor

14:10.708 --> 14:12.625
the situation.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.125
And the fire?

14:12.625 --> 14:15.125
A book burning.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.625
She showed up

14:15.125 --> 14:16.625
to the library

14:16.625 --> 14:19.791
a few hours ago

14:16.625 --> 14:19.791
and checked out a stack.

14:19.791 --> 14:21.708
Orwell, Salinger, Vonnegut.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.750
Neighbors heard her ranting

14:21.708 --> 14:24.750
about the board of education's

14:24.750 --> 14:26.791
conspiracy

14:24.750 --> 14:26.791
to corrupt young minds.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.750
Full-scale paranoid episode.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.083
Stay with me on this, Mills.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.083
Another one pops up,

14:31.083 --> 14:33.625
it's gonna turn into a circus

14:31.083 --> 14:33.625
around here real quick.

14:33.625 --> 14:35.875
No way I'm losing

14:33.625 --> 14:35.875
control of this.

14:39.750 --> 14:42.125
(phone ringing)

14:42.125 --> 14:44.750
I assume

14:42.125 --> 14:44.750
this call does not bode well.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.166
Another victim--

14:44.750 --> 14:47.166
housewife, mid-30s,

14:47.166 --> 14:48.541
chairwoman of the PTA.

14:48.541 --> 14:50.541
Don't acronym, Lieutenant.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.333
"Parent Teacher Association."

14:52.333 --> 14:54.083
Hold on.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.750
There's a pattern here.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.625
She's an authority figure.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.375
Person in a position of power.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.208
As were the other victims.

15:01.208 --> 15:03.583
A judge, General Washington...

15:03.583 --> 15:05.333
So it stands to reason,

15:05.333 --> 15:07.750
if the Soucouyant is the queen

15:05.333 --> 15:07.750
of her swarm,

15:07.750 --> 15:09.208
that she would attack

15:07.750 --> 15:09.208
other leaders.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.500
People in the driver's seat.

15:11.500 --> 15:15.291
And look at me,

15:11.500 --> 15:15.291
profiling a bug. I got to go.

15:15.291 --> 15:18.666
On me, Agent Mills.

15:15.291 --> 15:18.666
Who were you on the phone with?

15:18.666 --> 15:21.875
My roommate.

15:18.666 --> 15:21.875
I need you focused

15:18.666 --> 15:21.875
on this case, Agent.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.083
Instead of letting

15:21.875 --> 15:23.083
your personal life

15:23.083 --> 15:24.541
hamper another investigation.

15:35.541 --> 15:36.958
Okay...

15:36.958 --> 15:38.416
(engine starts)

15:47.000 --> 15:48.625
(engine revving,

15:47.000 --> 15:48.625
tires screeching, horn honking)

15:52.666 --> 15:54.625
(tires squealing)

15:54.625 --> 15:57.166
(horn honking)

15:57.166 --> 15:58.791
(tires squealing)

15:58.791 --> 16:02.166
Is everything

15:58.791 --> 16:02.166
all right?

15:58.791 --> 16:02.166
You tell me.

16:04.625 --> 16:08.041
(tires squealing)

16:08.041 --> 16:09.833
(horn honking)

16:09.833 --> 16:12.125
Whoa! Where are we going?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.625
I want some answers.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.625
I'm not sure I understand.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.750
We have a dead judge,

16:16.750 --> 16:18.083
dead housewife,

16:16.750 --> 16:18.083
and a cause of death

16:18.083 --> 16:19.583
that doesn't make any sense.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.125
Cut the crap for once.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.875
Why don't you tell me

16:22.875 --> 16:24.375
what's really going on?

16:24.375 --> 16:25.666
What's your game

16:24.375 --> 16:25.666
with my Nevins case?

16:25.666 --> 16:27.083
I spoke to Jenny already.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.458
You sent her in

16:27.083 --> 16:28.458
there, didn't you?

16:28.458 --> 16:30.583
No. I told you,

16:30.583 --> 16:33.166
her thing didn't start anywhere

16:30.583 --> 16:33.166
near your investigation.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.625
You said a lot,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.625
but none of it adds up.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.875
How did Granger

16:35.625 --> 16:37.875
really die?

16:37.875 --> 16:40.291
Why are you using your sister

16:37.875 --> 16:40.291
to blow a hole

16:40.291 --> 16:41.958
in the biggest case

16:40.291 --> 16:41.958
of my career?

16:41.958 --> 16:43.666
And who is that damn Crane guy?

16:43.666 --> 16:45.916
He's no historical

16:43.666 --> 16:45.916
consultant.

16:45.916 --> 16:48.125
Look, I know

16:45.916 --> 16:48.125
you like to win, Abbie,

16:48.125 --> 16:50.875
but going behind my back,

16:48.125 --> 16:50.875
undermining my authority?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.750
(laughs)

16:52.750 --> 16:54.541
You want to take it all away,

16:52.750 --> 16:54.541
is that it?

16:54.541 --> 16:55.958
You want it all for yourself?

16:56.958 --> 16:58.666
Hmm?

16:58.666 --> 17:00.666
Danny...

17:02.416 --> 17:03.750
Danny, please

17:02.416 --> 17:03.750
listen to me.

17:02.416 --> 17:03.750
To what?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.708
More lies, more double-talk?

17:05.708 --> 17:07.333
You've been stung by something.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.666
I've seen it

17:07.333 --> 17:08.666
in the other victims.

17:08.666 --> 17:11.250
It's impairing your judgment.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.000
(gasps)

17:21.583 --> 17:23.625
(panting)

17:25.625 --> 17:27.208
Okay, fine.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.250
Who are you calling?

17:27.208 --> 17:29.250
You trying to play me?

17:29.250 --> 17:32.250
Reynolds.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.250
You think I'll go

17:29.250 --> 17:32.250
down without a fight?

17:36.583 --> 17:39.041
Damn it, Mills, get off of me!

17:39.041 --> 17:42.625
I am sorry, Danny.

17:42.625 --> 17:43.708
Gonna get you some help.

17:43.708 --> 17:46.000
(grunts)

17:43.708 --> 17:46.000
I promise.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
(groans)

17:49.583 --> 17:50.958
Well, I gave

17:49.583 --> 17:50.958
him a sedative.

17:50.958 --> 17:52.666
Should knock him

17:50.958 --> 17:52.666
out for a bit.

17:52.666 --> 17:55.375
What happened

17:52.666 --> 17:55.375
to him anyway?

17:52.666 --> 17:55.375
He was stung by

17:55.375 --> 17:57.375
a Trinidadian paranoia monster.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.333
Welcome to Sleepy Hollow.

17:57.375 --> 18:00.333
Mm.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.416
CRANE:

18:00.333 --> 18:03.416
Lieutenant, the entry in

18:00.333 --> 18:03.416
Grace Dixon's journal--

18:03.416 --> 18:05.166
'tis not a riddle

18:03.416 --> 18:05.166
nor a nursery rhyme.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.541
'Tis a ditty devised

18:05.166 --> 18:07.541
to have a double meaning.

18:07.541 --> 18:08.750
It's the Trini way.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.333
I was down there

18:08.750 --> 18:10.333
once for Carnival.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.125
It's all about the

18:10.333 --> 18:12.125
double entendre.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.625
Listen: "When comes

18:12.125 --> 18:14.625
the beauty from Caribee,

18:14.625 --> 18:17.625
she spends her time

18:14.625 --> 18:17.625
in Port of Spain."

18:17.625 --> 18:19.125
Not time as measured by a clock.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.416
The herb Spanish thyme. Next.

18:22.416 --> 18:25.666
"Watching foul flies roost

18:22.416 --> 18:25.666
in the spice tree."

18:25.666 --> 18:27.500
Not a foul scent, but a spice.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.833
Bird pepper.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.833
A list of ingredients.

18:29.833 --> 18:34.000
For the tonic Miss Dixon used to

18:29.833 --> 18:34.000
treat Washington. And finally:

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
"Under which Sir Chadwick prays

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
on bended knee."

18:37.000 --> 18:38.916
Chadon Beni-- a

18:37.000 --> 18:38.916
medicinal herb that only

18:38.916 --> 18:41.791
grows in Trinidad, but I know

18:38.916 --> 18:41.791
someone who may have a supply.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.666
You stay here with Reynolds.

18:43.666 --> 18:45.708
Joe and I will be back

18:43.666 --> 18:45.708
as soon as we can.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.791
Nice.

18:47.666 --> 18:49.791
Thank you.

18:49.791 --> 18:52.291

Hope you know how much

19:25.791 --> 19:27.666

19:31.666 --> 19:33.291
So, what is this guy, some kind

19:33.291 --> 19:35.083

19:33.291 --> 19:35.083

19:36.541 --> 19:41.458
Jenny Mills. Long time.

19:41.458 --> 19:43.250
Long enough for you

19:41.458 --> 19:43.250
to get a man.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.291
Oh, no, he's not my...

19:43.250 --> 19:45.291
No, no, no, we're not...

19:45.291 --> 19:46.333

19:53.250 --> 19:54.500
(chuckling)

19:53.250 --> 19:54.500
Uh, we need something

19:54.500 --> 19:57.291
off the red list, Azzaca.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.750
Chadon Beni.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.083
That is a tough one

19:59.750 --> 20:02.083
on short notice.

20:02.083 --> 20:05.041
I have to call a fella

20:02.083 --> 20:05.041
who could call a fella

20:02.083 --> 20:05.041
who has a boat, but...

20:05.041 --> 20:07.416
No time to haggle.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.416
Quarter pound.

20:07.416 --> 20:08.708
Friends-and-family rate.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.958
We're on the clock.

20:10.958 --> 20:14.541
An Obeah man is only capable

20:10.958 --> 20:14.541
of so much, Jennifer Mills.

20:14.541 --> 20:16.166
I cannot bend time and space.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.333
And if we pay cash?

20:18.875 --> 20:22.541
Oh, you mean to say

20:18.875 --> 20:22.541
that  Chadon Beni?

20:23.583 --> 20:25.583
I have a pinch

20:23.583 --> 20:25.583
for emergencies.

20:25.583 --> 20:26.875
Oh. Yeah.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.916
I like this one.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.416
Keep him.

20:32.833 --> 20:34.750
(both chuckle)

20:49.541 --> 20:52.000

20:49.541 --> 20:52.000
low and indistinct)

20:54.958 --> 20:56.541

20:58.166 --> 21:00.875

20:58.166 --> 21:00.875
A shadow older than time falls

21:00.875 --> 21:02.333
over your soul.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.708
You shall be claimed.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.958
Hey, let her go. Come on.

21:04.708 --> 21:06.958
Come on, get off her, man!

21:06.958 --> 21:08.500
(grunts)

21:08.500 --> 21:10.541
Azzaca, what the hell?

21:11.666 --> 21:13.875
Watch yourself, sis.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.000
Your fate has changed.

21:17.208 --> 21:18.208
Protect her.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.666
Mills, where am I?

21:34.666 --> 21:36.291
Somewhere safe.

21:38.291 --> 21:40.458
(handcuffs rattling, clacking)

21:40.458 --> 21:41.791
You can't do this to me.

21:41.791 --> 21:43.958
You need to stay still.

21:43.958 --> 21:45.750
There's something

21:43.958 --> 21:45.750
in your system,

21:45.750 --> 21:48.625
and the more that you struggle,

21:45.750 --> 21:48.625
the faster it'll kill you.

21:48.625 --> 21:50.083
(panting softly)

21:50.083 --> 21:52.166
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

21:52.166 --> 21:53.583
No.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.791
We have people

21:53.583 --> 21:55.791
working on medicine.

21:55.791 --> 21:57.291
You just need to

21:55.791 --> 21:57.291
hang in there.

21:57.291 --> 21:58.666
The roommate?

21:58.666 --> 22:01.208
You trusted me before.

22:01.208 --> 22:04.041
Remember? Right?

22:01.208 --> 22:04.041
Hold on to that, Danny.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.583
(wry chuckle)

22:05.583 --> 22:08.375
You just can't see

22:05.583 --> 22:08.375
what you do to people.

22:10.166 --> 22:14.333
All I can do

22:10.166 --> 22:14.333
is try to do my best,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.083
be a friend, and do

22:14.333 --> 22:17.083

22:17.083 --> 22:19.708
The Outer Banks.

22:19.708 --> 22:22.083
That little shack on the beach.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.916
It wasn't much--

22:23.583 --> 22:25.916
the fan barely moved the air--

22:30.875 --> 22:33.708
that's when I found you.

22:34.958 --> 22:37.166
That's when I knew.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.333
And you left that place,

22:40.000 --> 22:43.333
but I'm still there.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.708

24:54.791 --> 24:58.083
the Soucouyant can be

24:54.791 --> 24:58.083

24:58.083 --> 25:00.125
follow her home

24:58.083 --> 25:00.125

25:00.125 --> 25:02.083

25:00.125 --> 25:02.083
Folklore...

25:02.083 --> 25:03.666
usually has a basis in reality.

25:03.666 --> 25:05.708
What if the answer here isn't

25:09.208 --> 25:10.875
You want to kill bees?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.583
Wasps? Destroy the hive.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.000
They never stray far

25:13.583 --> 25:16.000

I always thought

25:47.166 --> 25:48.958
it was decorative.

25:49.791 --> 25:50.791
Look...

25:50.791 --> 25:54.333
A tree with six blossoms.

25:54.333 --> 25:57.500
This is the sixth creature

25:54.333 --> 25:57.500

25:57.500 --> 25:58.791
Whatever it is she's planning,

25:58.791 --> 26:01.000
I fear she may be close

25:58.791 --> 26:01.000
to achieving her goal.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.375
What if the Soucouyant's hive

26:02.375 --> 26:04.125

26:05.583 --> 26:07.583

Yeah. I've tried it.

26:16.750 --> 26:20.291
My dad used to bring me here

26:16.750 --> 26:20.291
when I was a kid, remember?

26:20.291 --> 26:22.875
Where is your friend?

26:22.875 --> 26:24.041
Mills isn't a part of this.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.666
Hmm.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.875
(chuckles)

26:33.083 --> 26:34.875
Look at us.

26:38.583 --> 26:39.750
So what are these?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.708
Bank accounts? Transit numbers?

26:44.750 --> 26:46.625
That's Liechtenstein

26:44.750 --> 26:46.625
and that's Geneva.

26:46.625 --> 26:48.625
It was your father's idea.

26:46.625 --> 26:48.625
I wanted to hide the cash

26:48.625 --> 26:50.291
in Bolivia, like a...

26:50.291 --> 26:52.041
Butch and Sundance thing.

26:52.041 --> 26:54.208
Back then your father

26:52.041 --> 26:54.208
was much smarter

26:54.208 --> 26:56.000
than me with money.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.583
Congrats on your inheritance.

26:57.583 --> 27:01.250
I mean, even though...

26:57.583 --> 27:01.250
you had to get it by selling out

27:01.250 --> 27:02.291
your friends.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.875
(gun cocks)

27:14.291 --> 27:16.750
Boy, you look like your father,

27:16.750 --> 27:19.666
when we were shavetails

27:16.750 --> 27:19.666
down at Parris Island.

27:21.333 --> 27:24.750
This is where you give me

27:21.333 --> 27:24.750
what I want, son.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.250
That was the arrangement.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.458
What, you think

27:45.708 --> 27:47.458
I'm the villain here?

27:47.458 --> 27:48.541
No, no, no,

27:48.541 --> 27:50.458
it doesn't work

27:48.541 --> 27:50.458
like that.

27:50.458 --> 27:53.666
In this game, son,

27:50.458 --> 27:53.666
the debts collect  you.

27:55.458 --> 27:57.666
Your father learned that

27:55.458 --> 27:57.666
the hard way.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.458
Well, I'm not my father.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.583
Yeah.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.708
Ever asked yourself

28:03.708 --> 28:06.583
why you need to know?

28:06.583 --> 28:07.750
Why we're playing

28:06.583 --> 28:07.750
ring-around-the-rosy

28:07.750 --> 28:09.541
over this little hunk of stone?

28:10.583 --> 28:13.291
You're  exactly  like him.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.583
You're drawn to the darkness,

28:14.750 --> 28:17.583
and you can't look away.

28:18.583 --> 28:19.875
That...

28:19.875 --> 28:23.583
that badge of your father's,

28:19.875 --> 28:23.583
that, uh...

28:23.583 --> 28:26.833
Mayberry sheriff vibe...

28:26.833 --> 28:29.416
that was not

28:26.833 --> 28:29.416

28:29.416 --> 28:31.666
No, he knew the truth.

28:31.666 --> 28:33.625
There is no good...

28:33.625 --> 28:35.833
no evil...

28:35.833 --> 28:38.041

29:50.625 --> 29:52.958

If there's money...

29:52.958 --> 29:55.416
my dad's money.

29:55.416 --> 29:56.416
You believe him?

29:56.416 --> 29:57.583
I don't know.

29:57.583 --> 29:59.416
Well, we got more than

29:57.583 --> 29:59.416
we could've hoped for.

30:00.458 --> 30:01.833

Go!

30:20.250 --> 30:23.583
These ruins are ancient.

30:23.583 --> 30:25.958
The architecture...

30:25.958 --> 30:27.958
unlike anything

30:25.958 --> 30:27.958
I've ever seen.

30:33.083 --> 30:37.541

30:51.583 --> 30:53.625
I'll buy us some time.

30:53.625 --> 30:54.833
All right.

30:54.833 --> 30:57.333
Okay... hey...

30:57.333 --> 30:59.791
Secrets.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.958
Chaos.

31:07.916 --> 31:10.375
Loneliness.

31:13.708 --> 31:15.666
Innocence lost.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.166
Death.

31:22.583 --> 31:24.708

31:24.708 --> 31:26.583
CRANE:

31:24.708 --> 31:26.583
Fear itself.

31:32.166 --> 31:36.083
The tree, the flowers,

31:36.083 --> 31:38.625
the creatures you summoned,

31:36.083 --> 31:38.625
they all serve a single purpose,

31:38.625 --> 31:39.750
do they not?

31:39.750 --> 31:41.750
You're cultivating

31:41.750 --> 31:43.041
forms of terror.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.208
Very specific ones.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.208
And I should

31:45.208 --> 31:47.208
thank you

31:47.208 --> 31:48.750
and your lady friend

31:48.750 --> 31:51.083

31:51.083 --> 31:54.500
Calling beasts out of the box

31:51.083 --> 31:54.500

31:54.500 --> 31:57.166

32:25.083 --> 32:27.041

32:35.833 --> 32:37.583
all the fear I need,

He'll make a full recovery,

38:46.791 --> 38:48.541
and... thankfully,

38:48.541 --> 38:50.708
he doesn't remember anything,

38:48.541 --> 38:50.708
which is a blessing

38:50.708 --> 38:52.125
on so many levels.

38:52.125 --> 38:53.125
Uh...

38:53.125 --> 38:54.916
I'm trying to figure out

38:54.916 --> 38:57.041
where Pandora

38:54.916 --> 38:57.041
may have gone.

38:57.041 --> 38:58.666
That passage

38:58.666 --> 39:01.666
under the tree,

38:58.666 --> 39:01.666
the stairwell leading down...

39:01.666 --> 39:06.166
Trees are often associated with

39:01.666 --> 39:06.166
the entrance to the underworld.

39:06.166 --> 39:09.250
Yggdrasil,

39:06.166 --> 39:09.250
the Norse realm of Hel.

39:09.250 --> 39:10.833
The levels

39:09.250 --> 39:10.833
of Dante's  Inferno

39:10.833 --> 39:13.666
can be interpreted

39:10.833 --> 39:13.666
as a stairwell of sorts.

39:10.833 --> 39:13.666
Yeah,

39:13.666 --> 39:14.541
that sounds like good news.

39:16.083 --> 39:17.666
You're thinking

39:16.083 --> 39:17.666
that everything up until now

39:17.666 --> 39:19.083
has been a warm-up act.

39:20.375 --> 39:23.291
I'd stake my life on it.

39:23.291 --> 39:24.791
The tree,

39:24.791 --> 39:26.875
the types of fear she raised--

39:26.875 --> 39:29.166
she's preparing something.

39:29.166 --> 39:32.833
I fear her return

39:29.166 --> 39:32.833
is inevitable.

39:32.833 --> 39:35.625
The only question is...

39:35.625 --> 39:39.250
what insidious plan

39:35.625 --> 39:39.250
does she have for her return?

39:39.250 --> 39:41.500
Whatever it is,

39:41.500 --> 39:44.083
she messed with our town,

39:44.083 --> 39:46.166
our friends,

39:46.166 --> 39:49.458
and the people

39:46.166 --> 39:49.458
that we care about.

39:49.458 --> 39:51.708
If she wants a rematch,

39:49.458 --> 39:51.708
I say bring it on.

39:51.708 --> 39:54.041
Oh, Lieutenant,

39:54.041 --> 39:56.375
that is a quote we can live by.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.125
(thunder rumbling)

40:05.125 --> 40:06.375
(grunting quietly)

40:07.583 --> 40:09.083
(grunting)

40:13.625 --> 40:16.166
(overlapping, indistinct voices)

40:27.458 --> 40:30.250
(gasping, panting)
