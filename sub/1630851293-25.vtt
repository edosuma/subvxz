00:41.166 --> 00:42.166
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"!

00:42.233 --> 00:43.000
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:43.066 --> 00:43.766
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:43.833 --> 00:44.766
JUST TIME FOR A QUICK RECAP OF

00:44.833 --> 00:46.366
THE WEEK, IN WHICH THE U.S.

00:46.433 --> 00:47.833
SURPASSED 700,000 COVID DEATHS,

00:47.900 --> 00:49.000
R. KELLY WAS FOUND GUILTY,

00:49.066 --> 00:50.466
AND THERE WAS A GAS CRISIS IN

00:50.533 --> 00:51.966
THE U.K., THANKS TO A

00:52.033 --> 00:53.133
COVID-INDUCED SHORTAGE OF TRUCK

00:53.200 --> 00:55.300
DRIVERS EXACERBATED BY BREXIT.

00:55.366 --> 00:56.866
IT CAUSED MASSIVE PANIC BUYING,

00:56.933 --> 00:58.100
BUT ALSO, THIS INCREDIBLE

01:23.100 --> 01:23.533
EXCELLENT.

01:23.600 --> 01:24.433
TAUNTING PEOPLE WAITING FOR

01:24.500 --> 01:25.233
PETROL IN THEIR STUPID CARS BY

01:25.300 --> 01:26.100
SINGING YOUR HORSE RUNS ON

01:26.166 --> 01:27.166
CARROTS IS OBJECTIVELY

01:27.233 --> 01:27.766
HILARIOUS.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.233
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, WHILE, YES,

01:29.300 --> 01:30.733
HORSE OWNERS DON'T NEED PETROL,

01:30.800 --> 01:31.666
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT CAR OWNERS

01:31.733 --> 01:33.066
DON'T HAVE TO CLEAN UP THEIR

01:33.133 --> 01:35.966
VEHICLE'S ENORMOUS SHITS.

01:36.033 --> 01:37.266
SO THE GRASS IS ALWAYS GREENER.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.466
BUT LET'S FOCUS ON THE EVENTS IN

01:38.533 --> 01:39.633
CONGRESS THIS WEEK.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.733
FOR A START, THE SENATE HELD A

01:40.800 --> 01:42.133
HEARING ON FACEBOOK AND

01:42.200 --> 01:44.333
INSTAGRAM'S IMPACT ON TEENAGERS'

01:44.400 --> 01:47.100
MENTAL HEALTH,

01:47.166 --> 01:51.766
A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.966
BUT ONE THAT PROMPTED THIS

01:54.033 --> 01:55.100
REMARKABLE QUESTION POSED BY

01:55.166 --> 01:56.066
SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:

01:56.133 --> 01:56.833
>> WILL YOU COMMIT TO ENDING

01:56.900 --> 01:57.866
FINSTA?

01:57.933 --> 01:58.600
>> SENATOR, AGAIN, LET ME

01:58.666 --> 02:00.033
EXPLAIN, WE DON'T ACTUALLY DO

02:00.100 --> 02:01.166
FINSTA.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.533
WHAT "FINSTA" REFERS TO IS YOUNG

02:02.600 --> 02:04.333
PEOPLE SETTING UP ACCOUNTS WHERE

02:04.400 --> 02:04.900
THEY MAY WANT TO HAVE MORE

02:04.966 --> 02:05.966
PRIVACY.

02:06.033 --> 02:08.100
>> FINSTA IS ONE OF YOUR

02:08.166 --> 02:11.000
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

02:11.066 --> 02:11.600
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT GOOGLE

02:11.666 --> 02:12.433
OR APPLE.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.866
IT'S FACEBOOK, CORRECT?

02:15.933 --> 02:17.900
>> FINSTA IS SLANG FOR A TYPE OF

02:17.966 --> 02:20.233
ACCOUNT.

02:20.300 --> 02:21.433
IT'S NOT A PRODUCT.

02:21.500 --> 02:22.766
>> OKAY, WILL YOU END THAT TYPE

02:22.833 --> 02:24.600
OF ACCOUNT?

02:24.666 --> 02:25.500
>> WE -- I'M NOT SURE I

02:25.566 --> 02:26.966
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE

02:27.033 --> 02:28.733
ASKING.

02:28.800 --> 02:29.400
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

02:29.466 --> 02:33.600
DON'T.

02:33.666 --> 02:35.166
'CAUSE WHAT HE JUST ASKED YOU

02:35.233 --> 02:35.866
MADE NO SENSE.

02:35.933 --> 02:36.633
AND EVEN BLUMENTHAL'S AIDE SEEMS

02:36.700 --> 02:37.400
AWARE OF THAT, AS HE VISIBLY

02:37.466 --> 02:38.466
WINCED IN PAIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER

02:38.533 --> 02:41.233
HEARING IT.

02:41.300 --> 02:42.500
THAT IS THE EXPRESSION OF

02:42.566 --> 02:43.600
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THEY'RE GOING

02:43.666 --> 02:45.066
TO HAVE TO STAY LATE TONIGHT

02:45.133 --> 02:46.266
EXPLAINING TO THEIR BOSS, YET

02:46.333 --> 02:47.700
AGAIN, WHAT "FINSTA" IS, BUT

02:47.766 --> 02:49.200
ALSO WHAT TWITTER IS AND WHY

02:49.266 --> 02:49.800
HE'S CURRENTLY GETTING ROASTED

02:49.866 --> 02:53.366
ON IT.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.866
BUT THE REAL DRAMA THIS WEEK

02:55.933 --> 02:56.500
CONCERNED THE FATE OF

02:56.566 --> 02:57.133
THE BUILD BACK BETTER

02:57.200 --> 02:57.966
ACT -- A KEY PART OF BIDEN'S

02:58.033 --> 02:58.800
AGENDA, PROJECTED TO COST

02:58.866 --> 02:59.966
$3.5 TRILLION OVER TEN YEARS,

03:00.033 --> 03:00.600
WITH DEMOCRATS INTENDING TO PAY

03:00.666 --> 03:01.333
FOR IT THROUGH INCREASED TAXES

03:01.400 --> 03:04.033
ON THE WEALTHY.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.066
IT CONTAINS, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

03:05.133 --> 03:06.466
FUNDING FOR AT-HOME CARE,

03:06.533 --> 03:08.300
UNIVERSAL PRE-K, FREE COMMUNITY

03:08.366 --> 03:09.500
COLLEGE, STEPS TO ADDRESS

03:09.566 --> 03:10.300
CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPANDED

03:10.366 --> 03:11.433
MEDICARE, AND AN EXTENSION OF

03:11.500 --> 03:15.100
THE CHILD TAX CREDIT -- WHICH

03:15.166 --> 03:16.433
ALONE IS ESTIMATED TO MEAN

03:16.500 --> 03:17.033
4.3 MILLION FEWER CHILDREN IN

03:17.100 --> 03:20.400
POVERTY.

03:20.466 --> 03:21.600
IT IS A BIG DEAL AND

03:21.666 --> 03:22.666
WOULD MAKE THIS COUNTRY A

03:22.733 --> 03:23.766
BETTER PLACE.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.033
BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

03:25.100 --> 03:25.800
BECAUSE TO PASS THE BILL,

03:25.866 --> 03:26.800
DEMOCRATS ARE USING SOMETHING

03:26.866 --> 03:27.433
CALLED "RECONCILIATION" TO EVADE

03:27.500 --> 03:28.600
A FILIBUSTER, WHICH REQUIRES THE

03:28.666 --> 03:29.100
SUPPORT OF EVERY SINGLE

03:29.166 --> 03:30.000
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR.

03:30.066 --> 03:32.233
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MODERATES

03:32.300 --> 03:33.866
LIKE KYRSTEN SINEMA AND

03:33.933 --> 03:35.200
JOE MANCHIN ARGUE IT COSTS TOO

03:35.266 --> 03:35.800
MUCH.

03:35.866 --> 03:36.933
NOW, TO COUNTER THAT,

03:37.000 --> 03:37.533
PROGRESSIVES HAVE SAID THEY'LL

03:37.600 --> 03:39.300
OPPOSE THE BIPARTISAN

03:39.366 --> 03:40.900
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL -- WHICH

03:40.966 --> 03:42.166
MANCHIN AND SINEMA WANT --

03:42.233 --> 03:43.133
UNLESS THE LARGER BILL IS

03:43.200 --> 03:47.833
GUARANTEED TO PASS ALONGSIDE IT.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.800
AND IF ALL OF THIS

03:49.866 --> 03:51.133
SEEMED CHAOTIC,

03:51.200 --> 03:51.900
JEN PSAKI ATTEMPTED TO REASSURE

03:51.966 --> 03:52.666
REPORTERS IT WAS ALL PART OF THE

03:52.733 --> 03:53.133
PROCESS:

03:53.200 --> 03:53.900
>> THIS IS WHY WE ALL CAME TO

03:54.000 --> 03:54.700
WASHINGTON.

03:54.766 --> 03:55.333
IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE OF A TV

03:55.400 --> 03:56.966
SHOW.

03:57.033 --> 03:58.000
UH, WE'RE -- WE -- I -- I'M NOT

03:58.066 --> 03:59.500
IN A POSITION TO LOOK IN A

03:59.566 --> 04:01.400
CRYSTAL BALL HERE.

04:01.466 --> 04:02.300
>> WHICH TV SHOW?

04:02.366 --> 04:03.633
>> MAYBE "THE WEST WING" IF

04:03.700 --> 04:05.566
SOMETHING GOOD HAPPENS, MAYBE

04:05.633 --> 04:07.600
"VEEP" IF NOT, I'M NOT SURE.

04:07.666 --> 04:08.733
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

04:08.800 --> 04:09.933
WANT TO BE "THE WEST WING."

04:10.000 --> 04:11.100
EVERY ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO BE

04:11.166 --> 04:12.800
"THE WEST WING."

04:12.866 --> 04:13.800
WHY WOULDN'T THEY?

04:13.866 --> 04:14.866
IT'S AMERICAN FAN-FICTION

04:14.933 --> 04:16.233
WRITTEN BY A MAN DRUNK ON

04:16.300 --> 04:16.766
LIBERAL RIGHTEOUSNESS AND

04:16.833 --> 04:19.700
WEAPONS-GRADE COCAINE.

04:19.766 --> 04:20.966
UNFORTUNATELY, THOUGH, THIS

04:21.033 --> 04:22.100
WHITE HOUSE MIGHT BE MORE OF A

04:22.166 --> 04:23.000
"MR. ROBOT," IN THAT I'M NOT

04:23.066 --> 04:27.200
SURE EVEN THE PEOPLE INVOLVED

04:27.266 --> 04:28.900
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON,

04:28.966 --> 04:30.466
AND UNLESS THEY'RE CAREFUL, IT

04:30.533 --> 04:33.366
MIGHT STOP AFTER FOUR YEARS.

04:33.433 --> 04:37.566
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY THIS, TO

04:37.633 --> 04:40.000
BIDEN'S CREDIT, HE SEEMS, SO

04:40.066 --> 04:42.666
FAR, TO BE SIDING WITH THE

04:42.733 --> 04:43.966
PROGRESSIVES, OR AT THE VERY

04:44.033 --> 04:44.566
LEAST, NOT SELLING THEM OUT.

04:44.633 --> 04:45.133
WHICH MAKES SENSE -- THE BILL

04:45.200 --> 04:45.866
CONTAINS POLICIES HE RAN ON, AND

04:45.933 --> 04:46.700
ITS CONTENTS ARE BROADLY

04:46.766 --> 04:46.933
POPULAR.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.600
BUT SINEMA AND MANCHIN SEEM

04:48.666 --> 04:52.833
UNMOVED.

04:52.900 --> 04:55.433
INJURE HIS CASE, HE WASN'T EVEN

04:55.500 --> 04:58.866
MOVED WITH THOSE MAKING IT IN

04:58.933 --> 05:06.100
PERSON THIS WEEK.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.000
PADDLING OUT

05:07.066 --> 05:07.600
TO HIS BOAT IN KAYAKS TO HEAR

05:07.666 --> 05:08.166
HIM EXPLAIN WHY HE'S HOLDING

05:08.233 --> 05:09.033
THINGS UP.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.000
>> WE WANT TO GET A GOOD BILL

05:10.066 --> 05:10.633
THAT'S A BALANCED BILL, THAT'S

05:10.700 --> 05:11.233
WELL DONE.

05:11.300 --> 05:12.666
AND I KNOW IT WON'T BE ENOUGH

05:12.733 --> 05:13.300
FOR SOME, IT'LL BE TOO MUCH FOR

05:13.366 --> 05:13.733
OTHERS.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.800
IN WEST VIRGINIA, YOU KNOW, WEST

05:14.866 --> 05:15.300
VIRGINIA'S A LITTLE BIT

05:15.366 --> 05:15.900
DIFFERENT THAN IT USED TO BE.

05:15.966 --> 05:16.866
>> THERE'S A LOT OF POVERTY.

05:16.933 --> 05:17.466
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR THE

05:17.533 --> 05:18.066
POOR IN WEST VIRGINIA?

05:18.133 --> 05:18.700
>> WE'RE WORKING -- WE'RE GOING

05:18.766 --> 05:19.333
TO BE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

05:19.400 --> 05:20.266
CREATE GOOD OPPORTUNITY.

05:20.333 --> 05:20.833
>> John: WOW.

05:20.900 --> 05:21.433
I'M NOT SURE WHICH STAGE OF

05:21.500 --> 05:22.433
CAPITALISM WE'VE REACHED IF

05:22.500 --> 05:23.433
WE'RE NOW "KAYAKING OUT TO A

05:23.500 --> 05:24.633
POLITICIAN'S YACHT TO BEG HIM TO

05:24.700 --> 05:25.466
HELP THE POOR," BUT IT'S GOTTA

05:25.533 --> 05:28.566
BE ONE OF THE LAST ONES.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.433
I'M PRETTY SURE IT GOES OCEAN ON

05:29.500 --> 05:31.166
FIRE, BOOKSTORE BILLIONAIRE

05:31.233 --> 05:33.100
LEAVES THE PLANET, THEN

05:33.166 --> 05:37.266
BOAT BITCH SAYS NO, AND THEN

05:37.333 --> 05:38.166
IT IS BASICALLY ALL OVER AT THAT

05:38.233 --> 05:42.066
POINT.

05:42.133 --> 05:42.800
BUT I WILL SAY, AT LEAST

05:42.866 --> 05:43.333
MANCHIN'S ACTUALLY

05:43.400 --> 05:44.033
ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE.

05:44.100 --> 05:44.600
KYRSTEN SINEMA HAS BEEN MUCH

05:44.666 --> 05:45.300
MORE EVASIVE.

05:45.366 --> 05:46.100
SHE'S MADE A NAME FOR HERSELF AS

05:46.166 --> 05:46.733
TRYING HARD TO BE "THE FUN ONE"

05:46.800 --> 05:47.400
IN THE SENATE, DRESSING HERE

05:47.466 --> 05:48.266
LIKE A POWERPUFF GIRL IN WITNESS

05:48.333 --> 05:50.066
PROTECTION.

05:50.133 --> 05:51.600
BUT IT'S BEEN A LOT LESS FUN

05:51.666 --> 05:52.800
THIS WEEK WATCHING HER TURN

05:52.866 --> 05:53.733
BASIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HER

05:53.800 --> 05:55.000
BARGAINING POSITION INTO A

05:55.066 --> 05:57.966
SHITTY GAME.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.400
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO

05:59.466 --> 06:00.666
PROGRESSIVES THAT ARE FRUSTRATED

06:00.733 --> 06:03.533
THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

06:03.600 --> 06:05.633
>> I'M IN THE SENATE.

06:05.700 --> 06:06.433
>> John: OH, FUCK RIGHT OFF.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.666
AND IT GETS WORSE.

06:08.733 --> 06:09.533
WHEN THAT REPORTER ASKED HER A

06:09.600 --> 06:10.266
SECOND TIME, SHE SAID "I'M

06:10.333 --> 06:10.866
CLEARLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE

06:10.933 --> 06:11.600
ELEVATOR."

06:11.666 --> 06:12.800
WHICH IS ABOUT AS MADDENING AS

06:12.866 --> 06:13.566
WHEN YOU TELL YOUR DAD "I'M

06:13.633 --> 06:14.833
HUNGRY" AND HE SAYS "NICE TO

06:14.900 --> 06:15.366
MEET YOU, HUNGRY.

06:15.433 --> 06:18.766
I'M DAD."

06:18.833 --> 06:21.000
I MEAN, YEAH, YOU TECHNICALLY

06:21.066 --> 06:22.466
"GOT ME" AND YOU CERTAINLY HAVE

06:22.533 --> 06:23.733
A PLAYFUL WAY WITH WORDS, BUT

06:23.800 --> 06:24.700
I'VE GOT A FUCKING PROBLEM THAT

06:24.766 --> 06:25.966
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SOLVE.

06:26.033 --> 06:27.200
AND THAT EVASIVENESS MAY HAVE

06:27.266 --> 06:28.200
REACHED ITS PEAK WHEN SHE TOOK

06:28.266 --> 06:29.900
OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF

06:29.966 --> 06:31.233
NEGOTIATIONS FOR ARIZONA, WHERE

06:31.300 --> 06:32.000
SHE ATTENDED A FUNDRAISER AT A

06:32.066 --> 06:32.933
HIGH-END RESORT AND SPA IN

06:33.000 --> 06:36.966
PHOENIX LAST NIGHT.

06:37.033 --> 06:37.600
AND AMID ALL OF THE FRUSTRATIONS

06:37.666 --> 06:38.766
WITH SINEMA, HER SUPPORTERS HAVE

06:38.833 --> 06:39.733
TRIED TO CAST HER ECCENTRICITIES

06:39.800 --> 06:44.600
AS AN ASSET, WITH ONE SAYING,

06:44.666 --> 06:45.266
"SHE DOESN'T THINK IN A LINEAR

06:45.333 --> 06:46.166
PROCESS, LIKE 'OKAY, WILL THIS

06:46.233 --> 06:46.666
IMPACT MY RE-ELECTION?'

06:46.733 --> 06:47.366
SHE JUST BEATS HER OWN DRUM.

06:47.433 --> 06:48.533
WHEN SHE LEAVES IN THE MIDDLE OF

06:48.600 --> 06:49.166
SOMETHING AND SAYS, 'I GOT STUFF

06:49.233 --> 06:50.200
TO DO,' IT'S BECAUSE SHE HAS

06:50.266 --> 06:51.600
PLANS.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.233
SOMETIMES, SHE'S JUST MORE

06:53.300 --> 06:54.033
INTERESTED IN TRAINING FOR AN

06:54.100 --> 06:54.866
IRONMAN.

06:54.933 --> 06:59.066
MORE POWER TO HER, MAN."

06:59.133 --> 07:00.766
EXCEPT, HERE'S THE THING, NO,

07:00.833 --> 07:01.233
NOT MORE POWER TO HER.

07:01.300 --> 07:01.833
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF HER OWN

07:01.900 --> 07:02.900
SUPPORTERS TELLING YOU SHE'S

07:02.966 --> 07:03.900
IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND,

07:03.966 --> 07:04.800
DOESN'T THINK IN A LINEAR

07:04.866 --> 07:05.633
PROCESS, AND WANDERS OFF IN THE

07:05.700 --> 07:08.166
MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION.

07:08.233 --> 07:09.500
AND IT'S NOT GREAT WHEN A

07:09.566 --> 07:11.266
SENATOR'S STRENGTHS ARE HOW I

07:11.333 --> 07:13.566
WOULD DESCRIBE ANY CAT.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.300
THOSE QUALITIES, IN A CIVILIAN,

07:15.366 --> 07:16.533
MIGHT MAKE YOU A FUN ECCENTRIC,

07:16.600 --> 07:17.233
BUT WHEN YOU'RE A SENATOR, IT

07:17.300 --> 07:18.433
JUST MAKES YOU BAD AT YOUR

07:18.500 --> 07:19.633
FUCKING JOB.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.466
LOOK, THIS BILL COULD MATERIALLY

07:21.533 --> 07:26.533
BENEFIT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.866
AND IF YOU ARE BLOCKING IT, YOU

07:27.933 --> 07:28.700
OWE PEOPLE MORE THAN VAGUE

07:28.766 --> 07:29.400
PLATITUDES SHOUTED FROM A BOAT,

07:29.466 --> 07:30.833
AND A CUTESY "I'M IN THE SENATE"

07:30.900 --> 07:32.366
COMMENT.

07:32.433 --> 07:35.333
BECAUSE IF THESE TWO KEEP THIS

07:35.400 --> 07:38.133
SHIT UP, THEIR WINDOW FOR SAYING

07:38.200 --> 07:40.633
"I'M IN THE SENATE" MAY RAPIDLY

07:40.700 --> 07:40.933
BE CLOSING.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.066
AND NOW THIS.

07:45.133 --> 07:45.566
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

07:45.633 --> 07:50.266
NEWSCASTERS TAKE ISSUE WITH THE

07:50.333 --> 07:56.066
TERM "LEAF-PEEPING."

07:56.133 --> 07:58.533
>> WE ARE GOING LEAF-PEEPING.

07:58.600 --> 07:58.900
>> LEAF-PEEPING.

07:58.966 --> 08:03.533
A LITTLE CREEPY BE.

08:03.600 --> 08:04.966
>> LEAF-PEEPING.

08:05.033 --> 08:06.366
>> I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SOUNDS

08:06.433 --> 08:06.933
A LITTLE PERVY.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.966
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.

08:09.033 --> 08:13.566
>> IT'S WEIRD, RIGHT?

08:13.633 --> 08:14.666
>> A BEAUTIFUL TIME.

08:14.733 --> 08:15.833
>> I FIND LEAF-PEEPING TO BE

08:15.900 --> 08:18.600
JUST MILDLY DISTURBING.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.633
>> I STILL SAY IT SOUNDS A

08:20.700 --> 08:22.500
LITTLE DIRTY.

08:22.566 --> 08:24.033
>> GET YOUR LEAF-PEEPING ON.

08:24.100 --> 08:25.000
>> LEAF-PEEPING.

08:25.066 --> 08:26.966
I'VE NEVER SAID THAT BEFORE.

08:27.033 --> 08:27.433
FIRST TEN.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.866
>> IT'S THE TYPE OF PEEPING

08:28.933 --> 08:32.866
THAT'S LEGAL.

08:32.933 --> 08:33.866
>> THAT'S --

08:33.933 --> 08:35.166
>> THAT'S THE CREEPIEST THING

08:35.233 --> 08:36.500
I'VE EVER HEARD.

08:36.566 --> 08:38.033
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYBODY CALL AT

08:38.100 --> 08:39.700
THAT.

08:39.766 --> 08:40.466
>> EXCEPT FOR THE PRODUCER THAT

08:40.533 --> 08:42.600
ROTATES.

08:42.666 --> 08:42.866
[LAUGHTER]

08:42.933 --> 08:43.433
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.533
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

08:44.600 --> 08:44.800
CHEMICALS.

08:44.866 --> 08:45.766
THE SUBSTANCES THAT, ALONG WITH

08:45.833 --> 08:46.400
SPAGHETTI, HEINEKEN, AND HUMAN

08:46.466 --> 08:47.366
ARMS, SHOULD NEVER BE KEPT IN A

08:47.433 --> 08:50.000
VAT IN YOUR NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE.

08:50.066 --> 08:50.766
SPECIFICALLY, WE'RE GOING TO

08:50.833 --> 08:52.066
TALK ABOUT A PARTICULAR CLASS OF

08:52.133 --> 08:54.600
CHEMICALS CALLED PFAs, WHICH

08:54.666 --> 08:55.866
STANDS FOR "PER- AND

08:55.933 --> 08:57.200
POLYFLUOROALKYL SUBSTANCES."

08:57.266 --> 09:04.100
THEY GO BY A WIDE VARIETY OF

09:04.166 --> 09:09.966
CHEMICAL NAMES LIKE ALL OF THES

09:10.033 --> 09:12.100
THESE, AND ARE USED BY

09:12.166 --> 09:12.600
RECOGNIZABLE BRANDS LIKE

09:12.666 --> 09:13.233
GORE-TEX AND TEFLON, AMONG MANY

09:13.300 --> 09:13.900
OTHERS -- BUT THE MAIN THING

09:13.966 --> 09:14.700
THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY

09:14.766 --> 09:15.366
MAKE SURFACES THAT DON'T GET

09:15.433 --> 09:16.100
STUFF STUCK TO THEM, WHICH IS

09:16.166 --> 09:16.733
SOMETHING A LOT OF US CARE

09:16.800 --> 09:17.533
ABOUT.

09:17.600 --> 09:18.366
ALTHOUGH, ARGUABLY, SOME MORE

09:18.433 --> 09:19.066
THAN OTHERS:

09:19.133 --> 09:19.666
>> MISSY!

09:19.733 --> 09:20.800
>> YES, CHEF.

09:20.866 --> 09:22.900
>> IF YOU SAUTE SCALLOPS IN A

09:22.966 --> 09:23.600
NONSTICK PAN, THEY WON'T STICK.

09:23.666 --> 09:24.200
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED FUCKING

09:24.266 --> 09:25.200
NON-STICK!

09:25.266 --> 09:25.900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT "NON-STICK"

09:25.966 --> 09:27.300
MEANS IN TEXAS, SWEETHEART, BUT

09:27.366 --> 09:28.966
FUCK ME.

09:29.033 --> 09:30.066
>> John: YOU KNOW, AS TEMPTED AS

09:30.133 --> 09:31.833
I AM TO MOCK GORDON RAMSAY, AS A

09:31.900 --> 09:33.433
BRITISH PERSON WHO HAS ALSO

09:33.500 --> 09:34.900
INEXPLICABLY MADE A CAREER OUT

09:34.966 --> 09:36.100
OF SHRIEKING OBSCENITIES AT

09:36.166 --> 09:37.533
AMERICANS AND NOT UNDERSTANDING

09:37.600 --> 09:39.433
TEXAS, GAME HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO

09:39.500 --> 09:41.500
RESPECT GAME.

09:41.566 --> 09:42.900
AND WHILE I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM,

09:42.966 --> 09:44.700
HE SCREAMS, WE ALL SCREAM FOR

09:44.766 --> 09:48.866
NON-STICK PANS, THERE'S JUST TWO

09:48.933 --> 09:49.633
BIG PROBLEMS HERE: FIRST, THESE

09:49.700 --> 09:50.466
CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO A

09:50.533 --> 09:52.166
MASSIVE ARRAY OF HEALTH ISSUES.

09:52.233 --> 09:52.800
HIGH EXPOSURE TO THESE TWO MAJOR

09:52.866 --> 09:54.900
PFAs ALONE HAVE BEEN LINKED TO

09:54.966 --> 09:56.133
HIGH CHOLESTEROL, ULCERATIVE

09:56.200 --> 09:58.100
COLITIS, PREGNANCY-INDUCED

09:58.166 --> 09:59.200
HYPERTENSION, THYROID DISEASE,

09:59.266 --> 10:00.733
TESTICULAR AND KIDNEY CANCER,

10:00.800 --> 10:03.466
AND DECREASED RESPONSE TO

10:03.533 --> 10:05.300
VACCINES.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.233
WHICH IS CLEARLY TERRIBLE,

10:06.300 --> 10:07.100
ALTHOUGH ALSO SHOULDN'T BE THAT

10:07.166 --> 10:07.633
SURPRISING, SEEING AS THE

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
ORIGINAL NAME FOR THIS SHOW WAS

10:08.766 --> 10:09.966
"THAT THING YOU LIKE IS BAD WITH

10:10.033 --> 10:12.333
SADDY LONGLEGS."

10:12.400 --> 10:13.900
AND SECOND, PFAs ARE WHAT'S

10:13.966 --> 10:15.200
KNOWN AS "FOREVER CHEMICALS" --

10:15.266 --> 10:16.100
STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THEY HAVE

10:16.166 --> 10:17.400
LIFETIMES IN THE THOUSANDS OF

10:17.466 --> 10:19.466
YEARS.

10:19.533 --> 10:20.633
AND THAT COMBINATION OF TOXICITY

10:20.700 --> 10:23.133
AND LONGEVITY IS A REAL PROBLEM,

10:23.200 --> 10:24.466
AS ONE CHEMICAL ENGINEER TRIED

10:24.533 --> 10:26.000
TO EXPLAIN TO CONGRESS A FEW

10:26.066 --> 10:27.700
YEARS BACK.

10:27.766 --> 10:29.400
>> IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

10:29.466 --> 10:31.000
THIS IS A MANMADE CHEMICAL.

10:31.066 --> 10:33.166
WE JUST PASS THE BATON TO OUR

10:33.233 --> 10:35.400
GENERATIONS OF KIDS.

10:35.466 --> 10:38.133
IN FACT, IF YOU WERE TO

10:38.200 --> 10:40.466
INCINERATE AND CREMATE ME, I

10:40.533 --> 10:41.000
WOULD TECHNICALLY BE A

10:41.066 --> 10:43.100
FLUOROCHEMICAL HAZARDOUS SOURCE.

10:43.166 --> 10:44.866
THE TEFLON MESH THAT IS USED IN

10:44.933 --> 10:46.633
MY HERNIA PRODUCES A VERY TOXIC

10:46.700 --> 10:49.166
GAS AND DECOMPOSES TO SOMETHING

10:49.233 --> 10:51.033
CALLED DEVIL'S PISS, WHICH IS

10:51.100 --> 10:53.600
HYDROFLUORIC ACID.

10:53.666 --> 10:55.833
YOU CAN'T KILL THIS BEAST.

10:55.900 --> 11:00.133
YOU CAN ONLY CONTROL IT.

11:00.200 --> 11:04.800
>> John: YEAH, THAT DOESN'T

11:04.866 --> 11:05.300
SOUND GREAT, DOES IT?

11:05.366 --> 11:07.100
ALSO, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

11:07.166 --> 11:09.300
THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED

11:09.366 --> 11:10.233
DEVIL'S PISS THAT ISN'T

11:10.300 --> 11:10.766
GORDON RAMSEY'S

11:10.833 --> 11:12.233
VERY REAL LINE OF ALCOHOLIC

11:12.300 --> 11:13.500
SPARKLING WATER,

11:13.566 --> 11:15.000
"HELL'S SELTZER," WHICH YOU CAN

11:15.066 --> 11:15.600
APPARENTLY GET IN FLAVORS SUCH

11:15.666 --> 11:16.466
AS MEAN GREEN, BERRY INFERNO,

11:16.533 --> 11:17.533
KNICKER TWIST, AND

11:17.600 --> 11:18.333
THAT'S FORKED.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.100
HELL'S SELTZER: FOR PEOPLE WHO

11:19.166 --> 11:21.766
HATE WATER AND THEMSELVES.

11:21.833 --> 11:22.700
BUT THAT MAN IS ABSOLUTELY

11:22.766 --> 11:23.166
RIGHT.

11:23.233 --> 11:23.900
TO AN EXTENT YOU MAY NOT

11:23.966 --> 11:25.433
CURRENTLY REALIZE, THE WORLD IS

11:25.500 --> 11:26.900
BASICALLY SOAKED IN THE

11:26.966 --> 11:28.033
DEVIL'S PISS RIGHT NOW.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.533
AND NOT IN A REMOTELY HOT WAY.

11:29.600 --> 11:30.733
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT WE'D TAKE

11:30.800 --> 11:32.500
A LOOK AT JUST HOW BAD THESE

11:32.566 --> 11:34.633
SUBSTANCES ARE, HOW LONG SOME OF

11:34.700 --> 11:36.000
THEIR MAJOR MANUFACTURERS KNEW

11:36.066 --> 11:37.066
ABOUT IT, AND HOW HARD THIS WILL

11:37.133 --> 11:38.533
ALL BE TO FIX.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.100
AND LET'S START BY LOOKING AT

11:40.166 --> 11:42.733
ONE OF THE MOST UBIQUITOUS PFAs:

11:42.800 --> 11:44.400
PFOA, ALSO KNOWN AS C8 BECAUSE

11:44.466 --> 11:45.733
OF ITS EIGHT CARBON MOLECULES.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.633
3M STARTED SELLING C8 BACK IN

11:48.700 --> 11:50.300
1951 TO THE CHEMICAL GIANT

11:50.366 --> 11:52.733
DuPONT, WHICH THEN USED IT TO

11:52.800 --> 11:54.666
MAKE TEFLON, WHICH IT MARKETED

11:54.733 --> 11:56.200
THROUGH ADS LIKE THIS:

11:56.266 --> 11:58.466
>> I USED TO BE A SLAVE TO

11:58.533 --> 11:59.166
SCRAPING AND SCRUBBING POTS AND

11:59.233 --> 12:00.400
PANS.

12:00.466 --> 12:01.633
BUT I'VE BEEN LIBERATED BY

12:01.700 --> 12:02.566
TEFLON.

12:02.633 --> 12:04.666
FOOD DOESN'T STICK TO TEFLON

12:04.733 --> 12:06.066
LIKE IT DOES TO OTHER THINGS.

12:06.133 --> 12:08.200
SEE?

12:08.266 --> 12:09.533
>> John: OKAY, "I USED TO BE A

12:09.600 --> 12:10.900
SLAVE" IS JUST NOT SOMETHING

12:10.966 --> 12:12.133
THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF A

12:12.200 --> 12:13.766
WHITE CHILD'S FACE UNLESS IT'S

12:13.833 --> 12:15.133
PINOCCHIO AFTER HE BECOMES A

12:15.200 --> 12:16.666
REAL BOY, AND EVEN THEN, HE'S

12:16.733 --> 12:18.066
STILL NOT "REALLY" FREE, IS HE?

12:18.133 --> 12:19.200
HE'S A SLAVE TO SOCIETY AND A

12:19.266 --> 12:20.233
PRISONER OF HIS OWN MIND, JUST

12:20.300 --> 12:21.766
LIKE THE REST OF US.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.833
YOUR NOSE MIGHT NOT BE GROWING

12:23.900 --> 12:24.433
ANY MORE, GNOCCHI, BUT MAKE NO

12:24.500 --> 12:25.033
MISTAKE -- YOU ARE LYING TO

12:25.100 --> 12:27.933
YOURSELF.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.366
BUT THE THING IS, BY THE TIME

12:29.433 --> 12:30.866
THAT AD AIRED, 3M AND DuPONT

12:30.933 --> 12:31.700
ALREADY KNEW THAT THESE

12:31.766 --> 12:33.600
CHEMICALS ACCUMULATED IN HUMANS

12:33.666 --> 12:35.433
AND ANIMALS, THAT THEY DIDN'T

12:35.500 --> 12:36.633
DEGRADE IN THE ENVIRONMENT, AND

12:36.700 --> 12:37.200
THAT THEY COULD INCREASE THE

12:37.266 --> 12:38.000
SIZE OF THE LIVER IN RATS,

12:38.066 --> 12:39.733
RABBITS, AND DOGS.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.000
SO THE WARNING SIGNS WERE VERY

12:41.066 --> 12:43.366
MUCH THERE BEFORE THEY HAD A

12:43.433 --> 12:44.633
WHITE CHILD SLAVE CLAIM TEFLON

12:44.700 --> 12:46.166
LIBERATED HER FROM THE

12:46.233 --> 12:47.733
BACK-BREAKING LABOR OF SCRAPING

12:47.800 --> 12:49.100
MUFFIN TRAYS.

12:49.166 --> 12:49.933
AND IN THE DECADES THAT

12:50.000 --> 12:50.733
FOLLOWED, THEY LEARNED EVEN

12:50.800 --> 12:57.000
MORE.

12:57.066 --> 12:58.300
IN 1981, 3M FOUND THAT INGESTION

12:58.366 --> 12:59.933
OF PFAs CAUSED BIRTH DEFECTS IN

13:00.000 --> 13:00.933
RATS, AND WHEN THEY TOLD DuPONT

13:01.000 --> 13:01.933
ABOUT THIS AND DuPONT THEN

13:02.000 --> 13:03.600
TESTED THE CHILDREN OF EMPLOYEES

13:03.666 --> 13:04.533
IN THEIR TEFLON DIVISION, THEY

13:04.600 --> 13:05.433
FOUND THAT, OF SEVEN BIRTHS, TWO

13:05.500 --> 13:06.433
HAD EYE DEFECTS -- INFORMATION

13:06.500 --> 13:07.300
THAT, INTERESTINGLY, DuPONT DID

13:07.366 --> 13:09.700
NOT MAKE PUBLIC.

13:09.766 --> 13:11.066
AND BY 1991, IT HAD GOTTEN

13:11.133 --> 13:12.866
UNAMBIGUOUS WARNINGS THAT IT

13:12.933 --> 13:16.433
THEN SPECTACULARLY IGNORED.

13:16.500 --> 13:18.066
>> 3M TOLD DuPONT THAT UNDER NO

13:18.133 --> 13:19.733
CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU PUT IT

13:19.800 --> 13:21.133
IN WATERWAYS.

13:21.200 --> 13:21.833
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE

13:21.900 --> 13:22.800
DOCUMENT.

13:22.866 --> 13:26.533
DON'T PUT THIS IN THE WATERWAYS.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.400
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY

13:28.466 --> 13:30.200
START DUMPING SO MUCH C8 INTO

13:30.266 --> 13:31.533
THE WATER THAT THEY, AT ONE

13:31.600 --> 13:32.866
POINT, LOSE TRACK OF HOW MUCH

13:32.933 --> 13:34.600
THEY'VE ACTUALLY PUT OUT THERE.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.633
>> John: WOW.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.666
HARMFUL CHEMICALS ARE NOT

13:37.733 --> 13:38.733
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD "LOSE TRACK

13:38.800 --> 13:39.600
OF."

13:39.666 --> 13:40.933
THEY'RE NOT YOUR CAR KEYS OR

13:41.000 --> 13:45.933
YOUR MIDDLE CHILD.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.500
OH, OH, I'M SORRY, I LOSE HIM IN

13:47.566 --> 13:48.200
A SUPERMARKET "ONE" TIME AND

13:48.266 --> 13:48.766
SUDDENLY "I'M" A BAD PARENT?

13:48.833 --> 13:49.333
CALM DOWN.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.233
IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS GONNA RUN

13:50.300 --> 13:52.233
OUT OF FOOD.

13:52.300 --> 13:55.633
BUT WAIT, IT GETS EVEN WORSE.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.166
TWO YEARS AFTER THAT, IN 1993, A

13:57.233 --> 13:58.400
DuPONT COMPANY MEMO SHOWS THAT

13:58.466 --> 13:59.933
FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY HAD A

14:00.000 --> 14:02.100
VIABLE CANDIDATE TO REPLACE

14:02.166 --> 14:03.700
C8 -- ONE THAT APPEARED TO BE

14:03.766 --> 14:04.966
LESS TOXIC AND STAYED IN THE

14:05.033 --> 14:05.866
BODY FOR A MUCH SHORTER DURATION

14:05.933 --> 14:06.266
OF TIME.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.333
BUT THE COMPANY DECIDED AGAINST

14:07.400 --> 14:08.566
IT, BECAUSE THE RISK WAS TOO

14:08.633 --> 14:10.900
GREAT -- SPECIFICALLY, THE RISK

14:10.966 --> 14:12.433
TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE, AND THE

14:12.500 --> 14:13.766
FACT THAT TEFLON PRODUCTS WERE

14:13.833 --> 14:16.000
WORTH ROUGHLY A BILLION IN

14:16.066 --> 14:24.100
ANNUAL REVENUE TO THEM, PROVING

14:24.166 --> 14:25.033
ONCE AND FOR ALL CORPORATIONS

14:25.100 --> 14:26.500
TRULY ARE PEOPLE --

14:26.566 --> 14:27.033
SPECIFICALLY, SOCIOPATHS.

14:27.100 --> 14:27.666
AND YET DESPITE KNOWING ALL OF

14:27.733 --> 14:28.300
THAT, DuPONT KEPT PUSHING FOR

14:28.366 --> 14:28.933
TEFLON TO BE USED IN MORE AND

14:29.000 --> 14:29.300
MORE PLACES.

14:29.366 --> 14:30.400
AND IN THIS AD FROM 1994, THEY

14:30.466 --> 14:31.166
BASICALLY PRESENT IT AS BEING

14:31.233 --> 14:33.700
WIZARDRY.

14:33.766 --> 14:37.033
>> CHEMISTRY IS THE -- IS THE

14:37.100 --> 14:38.000
PRACTICE OF MAGIC.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.100
PEOPLE THINK OF TEFLON AND THEY

14:39.166 --> 14:39.966
THINK OF FRYING PANS.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.566
TEFLON IS NOT ONE THING.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.066
PUTTING TEFLON ON A SURFACE WILL

14:44.133 --> 14:44.733
STOP BUGS FROM CRAWLING UP

14:44.800 --> 14:45.400
TREES.

14:45.466 --> 14:46.533
THEY'LL FALL RIGHT OFF THE TREE.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.233
TEFLON IS A CHAIN LOOP, IT'S

14:48.300 --> 14:48.866
SOMETHING I'VE COME UP WITH FOR

14:48.933 --> 14:49.766
BICYCLES.

14:49.833 --> 14:52.700
YOU KNOW, ONLY DuPONT MAKES

14:52.766 --> 14:53.300
TEFLON, BUT YOU CAN USE IT IN

14:53.366 --> 14:53.866
SATELLITES, ON FABRICS, OR

14:53.933 --> 14:55.000
LEATHER.

14:55.066 --> 14:56.566
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU HEARD

14:56.633 --> 15:02.500
ABOUT A LEATHER RAINCOAT?

15:02.566 --> 15:04.400
YOU CAN LET YOUR IMAGINATION RUN

15:04.466 --> 15:04.600
WILD

15:04.666 --> 15:05.200
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU GET TO PUT

15:05.266 --> 15:06.066
SOMETHING NEW IN THE WORLD.

15:06.133 --> 15:06.666
>> John: OKAY, THERE'S A LOT I

15:06.733 --> 15:07.366
DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THAT AD,

15:07.433 --> 15:08.600
INCLUDING WHY IT WAS SHOT BY

15:08.666 --> 15:10.500
SOMEONE WHO'S STILL TESTING OUT

15:10.566 --> 15:11.800
THE ZOOM FUNCTION ON THEIR

15:11.866 --> 15:12.900
CAMCORDER OR WHY THAT INCEL

15:12.966 --> 15:13.866
SANTA GIGGLED SO MENACINGLY AT

15:13.933 --> 15:15.666
THE IDEA OF A NONSTICK LEATHER

15:15.733 --> 15:19.966
RAINCOAT.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.233
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY,

15:21.300 --> 15:21.766
IF THAT'S HIS BAR, IT

15:21.833 --> 15:22.366
DOES SEEM PRETTY EASY TO MAKE

15:22.433 --> 15:23.333
SOMETHING NEW IN THE WORLD.

15:23.400 --> 15:23.966
I'LL SHOW YOU: LEATHER UMBRELLA,

15:24.033 --> 15:24.800
LEATHER FLOWER, LEATHER SNAKE,

15:24.866 --> 15:26.766
AND LEATHER ELMO.

15:26.833 --> 15:27.533
THAT IS FOUR GREAT IDEAS I JUST

15:27.600 --> 15:28.433
CAME UP WITH, AND I'M NOT EVEN A

15:28.500 --> 15:31.366
PhD IN A COSBY SWEATER.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.600
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE

15:32.666 --> 15:34.000
THE EPA WAS IN ALL THIS, YOU

15:34.066 --> 15:35.200
SHOULD KNOW, THEY WERE MORE THAN

15:35.266 --> 15:37.333
A LITTLE HAMSTRUNG HERE.

15:37.400 --> 15:42.000
UNDER THE 1976 TOXIC SUBSTANCES

15:42.066 --> 15:42.933
CONTROL ACT, THE EPA CAN REQUIRE

15:43.000 --> 15:43.600
TESTING FOR CHEMICALS ONLY WHEN

15:43.666 --> 15:45.200
IT'S BEEN PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF

15:45.266 --> 15:46.533
POTENTIAL HARM -- A SETUP "WHICH

15:46.600 --> 15:47.233
LARGELY ALLOWS CHEMICAL

15:47.300 --> 15:50.233
COMPANIES TO REGULATE

15:50.300 --> 15:51.233
THEMSELVES."

15:51.300 --> 15:54.233
WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTELY

15:54.300 --> 15:55.400
TERRIFYING SEQUENCE OF WORDS

15:55.466 --> 15:56.000
RIGHT UP THERE WITH "INCOMING

15:56.066 --> 15:59.066
FACETIME FROM JEFFREY TOOBIN."

15:59.133 --> 16:01.000
NOBODY WANTS TO HEAR THAT.

16:01.066 --> 16:01.666
AND EVEN WHEN THE EPA HAS TAKEN

16:01.733 --> 16:02.300
STEPS, THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY

16:02.366 --> 16:03.100
LIMITED.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.500
FOR INSTANCE, IN 2016, THEY

16:04.566 --> 16:05.800
ISSUED A HEALTH ADVISORY FOR TWO

16:05.866 --> 16:07.433
OF THE BIGGEST PFAs -- INCLUDING

16:07.500 --> 16:09.933
C8 -- SETTING AN "ACCEPTABLE

16:10.000 --> 16:13.800
LEVEL" FOR THEM IN DRINKING

16:13.866 --> 16:14.966
WATER OF 70 PARTS PER TRILLION,

16:15.033 --> 16:15.566
WHICH, INCIDENTALLY, A LOT OF

16:15.633 --> 16:16.533
PEOPLE STILL THINK IS TOO HIGH.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.466
BUT ALSO, CRUCIALLY, AN EPA

16:17.533 --> 16:18.866
HEALTH ADVISORY IS

16:18.933 --> 16:24.133
NON-ENFORCEABLE.

16:24.200 --> 16:24.300
ALL

16:24.366 --> 16:24.966
AND NO ONE IS GOING TO RESPECT A

16:25.033 --> 16:25.533
RULE IF IT'S NOT ENFORCED.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.800
IT'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE SIGNS

16:26.866 --> 16:29.600
EVERYONE SEES BUT IGNORES, LIKE

16:29.666 --> 16:31.266
"PLEASE TAKE ONE" ON A CANDY

16:31.333 --> 16:32.066
BOWL OR "PLEASE, NO SCULPTURE

16:32.133 --> 16:32.633
FUCKING" AT MADAME TUSSAUDS.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.500
I'M DOING IT.

16:33.566 --> 16:34.633
I'M TAKING TWO FUN-SIZE SNICKERS

16:34.700 --> 16:35.433
BARS, AND THEN I'M GONNA FUCK

16:35.500 --> 16:38.466
WAX MICHAEL BUBLE.

16:38.533 --> 16:39.366
I'M DOING IT.

16:39.433 --> 16:40.166
IT'S ALREADY DONE.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.733
GET OVER IT.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.366
AND THAT LAX LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT,

16:43.433 --> 16:44.800
COMBINED WITH DUMPING ON A SCALE

16:44.866 --> 16:47.333
SO HIGH THEY "LOSE TRACK" OF IT,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.466
HAS HAD SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.

16:49.533 --> 16:50.600
WHEN EPIDEMIOLOGISTS STUDIED THE

16:50.666 --> 16:51.666
MEDICAL HISTORY OF PEOPLE WHO

16:51.733 --> 16:53.033
LIVED NEAR A DuPONT PLANT, THEY

16:53.100 --> 16:54.233
FOUND RESIDENTS WITH HIGHER

16:54.300 --> 16:55.733
EXPOSURE TO DRINKING WATER

16:55.800 --> 16:57.400
CONTAMINATED WITH C8 HAD MUCH

16:57.466 --> 16:58.833
HIGHER RATES OF KIDNEY AND

16:58.900 --> 17:00.633
TESTICULAR CANCERS.

17:00.700 --> 17:02.033
AND IT WAS EVEN WORSE FOR THE

17:02.100 --> 17:04.433
PEOPLE WORKING INSIDE THE

17:04.500 --> 17:05.633
FACILITIES -- AS THIS MAN, WHO

17:05.700 --> 17:10.966
WORKED IN ONE OF DUPONT'S

17:11.033 --> 17:11.600
TESTING LABS, AND HAS BEEN

17:11.666 --> 17:14.566
DIAGNOSED WITH ULCERATIVE

17:14.633 --> 17:15.200
COLITIS AND RECTAL CANCER, CAN

17:15.266 --> 17:16.233
ATTEST.

17:16.300 --> 17:16.900
>> PEOPLE WOULD HANDLE THAT

17:16.966 --> 17:17.666
PRODUCT ON THE JOB, EVERY DAY,

17:17.733 --> 17:20.366
DAY IN, NIGHT OUT, AND THEN WE

17:20.433 --> 17:22.633
WENT TO 12-HOURS SHIFTS,

17:22.700 --> 17:24.300
AT 12 HOURS AT A TIME,

17:24.366 --> 17:25.033
WE HEATED IT AND BREATHED IT

17:25.100 --> 17:26.066
EVERY DAY.

17:26.133 --> 17:35.733
KEN WORKED ON A FOUR-MAN TEAM AT

17:35.800 --> 17:37.066
DuPONT'S PLANT TESTING C8

17:37.133 --> 17:37.533
BETWEEN 1974 AND 2001.

17:37.600 --> 17:38.233
OF THE FOUR, HE IS THE ONLY ONE

17:38.300 --> 17:39.533
STILL ALIVE.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.433
>> THE PEOPLE I LOVED, THEY

17:40.500 --> 17:41.933
DIED.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.433
WE WERE LIKE A FAMILY.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.033
>> John: LOOK, THAT IS CLEARLY

17:45.100 --> 17:45.600
AWFUL.

17:45.666 --> 17:46.266
BUT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO

17:46.333 --> 17:46.866
LIVE IN A TOWN WHERE PFAs ARE

17:46.933 --> 17:47.833
DUMPED, OR WORK IN A FACTORY

17:47.900 --> 17:48.933
THAT MAKES THEM, TO BE AFFECTED.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.433
REMEMBER, PFAs LAST A LONG TIME,

17:51.500 --> 17:52.833
SO IF THEY SINK INTO THE

17:52.900 --> 17:54.400
GROUNDWATER OR ARE RELEASED INTO

17:54.466 --> 17:56.466
THE AIR, THEY CAN TRAVEL.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.766
AND THEY CAN BIOACCUMULATE,

17:57.833 --> 17:58.933
MEANING THEY BUILD UP IN YOUR

17:59.000 --> 18:00.133
BODY OVER TIME.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.800
AND THAT BRINGS US TO A SHOCKING

18:01.866 --> 18:03.200
DISCOVERY.

18:03.266 --> 18:04.933
BECAUSE IN THE 1970s, DuPONT

18:05.000 --> 18:06.266
AND 3M STARTED TESTING WORKERS

18:06.333 --> 18:07.633
TO CHECK THE LEVELS OF PFAs IN

18:07.700 --> 18:09.500
THEIR BLOOD.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.133
AND 3M WANTED A CONTROL GROUP

18:12.200 --> 18:12.866
WITH "CLEAN BLOOD" SO THEY'D

18:12.933 --> 18:13.800
HAVE A BASELINE.

18:13.866 --> 18:14.866
BUT AS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL

18:14.933 --> 18:16.233
ACTIVIST POINTS OUT, THE COMPANY

18:16.300 --> 18:20.700
QUICKLY REALIZED SOMETHING

18:20.766 --> 18:21.366
TRULY HORRIFYING.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.633
>> THERE WAS NO CLEAN BLOOD.

18:22.700 --> 18:23.333
THEY TESTED KIDS, THEY TESTED

18:23.400 --> 18:24.900
ADULTS, THEY WENT TO ASIA, THEY

18:24.966 --> 18:28.000
WENT ALL OVER THE WORLD AND

18:28.066 --> 18:29.100
EVERYWHERE THEY LOOKED,

18:29.166 --> 18:30.166
PRACTICALLY, THEY FOUND THEIR

18:30.233 --> 18:33.266
CHEMICALS IN PEOPLE'S BLOOD.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.933
EVENTUALLY, THEY DID FIND SOME

18:35.000 --> 18:39.166
CLEAN BLOOD.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.833
IT TURNED OUT IT WAS THE BLOOD

18:41.900 --> 18:43.633
THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM ARMY

18:43.700 --> 18:44.966
RECRUITS AND ARCHIVED, SAVED, AT

18:45.033 --> 18:46.866
THE START OF THE KOREAN WAR.

18:46.933 --> 18:48.533
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

18:48.600 --> 18:49.500
IN FACT, A CDC STUDY HAS FOUND

18:49.566 --> 18:51.800
THAT C8 IS NOW IN THE BLOOD OF

18:51.866 --> 18:57.166
99.7% OF AMERICANS.

18:57.233 --> 18:58.500
MEANING, AT THE VERY LEAST,

18:58.566 --> 18:59.366
VIN DIESEL AND I FINALLY HAVE

18:59.433 --> 18:59.866
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

18:59.933 --> 19:00.833
EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT OUR

19:00.900 --> 19:01.900
GENETIC MAKEUP, GENERAL

19:01.966 --> 19:03.233
ATTITUDE, AND VOCAL TIMBRE IS

19:03.300 --> 19:05.033
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT, BUT WHEN

19:05.100 --> 19:06.366
IT COMES TO TOXIC CHEMICALS IN

19:06.433 --> 19:06.966
OUR BLOOD -- IT'S POTATO,

19:07.033 --> 19:09.266
POTAHTO, MY FRIEND.

19:09.333 --> 19:12.833
OR SHOULD I SAY, MY FAMILY.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.300
AND WHILE DuPONT MAY BE A

19:14.366 --> 19:15.166
PARTICULARLY STARK EXAMPLE,

19:15.233 --> 19:15.866
THEY'RE FAR FROM THE ONLY ENTITY

19:15.933 --> 19:17.666
INVOLVED HERE.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.100
THE MILITARY USES PFAs IN FOAM

19:19.166 --> 19:20.633
TO EXTINGUISH FIRES, SO THEY'VE

19:20.700 --> 19:22.700
BUILT UP AROUND MILITARY BASES.

19:22.766 --> 19:24.300
AND MANY COMPANIES HAVE USED A

19:24.366 --> 19:25.600
LOT OF PFAs IN A LOT OF THEIR

19:25.666 --> 19:27.500
PRODUCTS.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.300
FOR INSTANCE, A SHOE COMPANY

19:29.366 --> 19:30.900
CALLED WOLVERINE USED PFAs IN

19:30.966 --> 19:33.600
ITS WATERPROOF HUSH PUPPIES.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.700
BUT IT WAS ONLY AFTER LOCAL

19:34.766 --> 19:36.100
REPORTING THAT RESIDENTS NEAR

19:36.166 --> 19:37.166
ITS FACTORY IN BELMONT,

19:37.233 --> 19:38.300
MICHIGAN, KNEW TO GET THEIR

19:38.366 --> 19:39.500
WATER TESTED -- AND FOR ONE

19:39.566 --> 19:40.800
FAMILY, THE McNAUGHTONS, THE

19:40.866 --> 19:42.533
RESULTS WERE PRETTY STRIKING.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.133
AND BEFORE YOU WATCH THIS,

19:44.200 --> 19:46.200
REMEMBER: THE EPA'S ACCEPTABLE

19:46.266 --> 19:47.766
LEVEL IN DRINKING WATER IS

19:47.833 --> 19:49.300
70 PARTS PER TRILLION.

19:49.366 --> 19:50.533
>> THEY LIVED IN THEIR HOUSE

19:50.600 --> 19:51.533
ABOUT THREE YEARS WHEN TOBYN

19:51.600 --> 19:53.366
LEARNED SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH

19:53.433 --> 19:54.900
THEIR SON, JACK.

19:54.966 --> 19:57.033
>> WE WERE REALLY EXCITED.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.966
I WANTED THAT TO GO REALLY WELL,

19:59.033 --> 19:59.666
SO I DRANK EIGHT GLASSES OF

19:59.733 --> 20:00.400
WATER A DAY.

20:00.466 --> 20:01.533
I, LIKE, KEPT TRACK.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.966
I ATE REALLY HEALTHY.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.000
>> IN APRIL OF 2016, JACK WAS

20:05.066 --> 20:06.400
BORN.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.466
>> HE HAD AN IMMENSE APPETITE

20:07.533 --> 20:11.733
FOR WATER.

20:11.800 --> 20:12.866
HE WAS THIRSTY ALL THE TIME.

20:12.933 --> 20:14.133
>> TEST SHOWED ALMOST 2,000

20:14.200 --> 20:16.200
PARTS PER TRILLION OF PFAs IN

20:16.266 --> 20:19.833
THE MCNAUGHTON'S WATER.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.200
AS SOON AS THEY COULD, TOBYN AND

20:21.266 --> 20:22.800
SETH HAD JACK'S BLOOD TESTED.

20:22.866 --> 20:24.533
THE RESULTS -- 484,000 PARTS PER

20:24.600 --> 20:25.300
TRILLION, MORE THAN 100 TIMES

20:25.366 --> 20:28.233
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.500
>> HE'S THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

20:30.566 --> 20:31.600
PFAs THAT WE KNOW RIGHT NOW OF

20:31.666 --> 20:33.033
ANY CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES.

20:33.100 --> 20:34.766
HE GETS SICK MORE OFTEN AND HIS

20:34.833 --> 20:37.166
VACCINATIONS HAVEN'T WORKED.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.366
>> John: WOW, THAT IS

20:38.433 --> 20:39.900
INCREDIBLE.

20:39.966 --> 20:41.533
USUALLY WHEN YOUR CHILD IS THE

20:41.600 --> 20:43.200
HIGHEST IN SOMETHING, YOUR

20:43.266 --> 20:44.166
INSTINCT IS TO BRAG ABOUT IT,

20:44.233 --> 20:45.266
BUT GOOD LUCK FINDING A BUMPER

20:45.333 --> 20:46.466
STICKER WITH "MY CHILD HAS THE

20:46.533 --> 20:47.666
HIGHEST LEVEL OF PFAs IN THE

20:47.733 --> 20:52.633
UNITED STATES."

20:52.700 --> 20:57.100
NOBODY WANTS THAT SHIT.

20:57.166 --> 20:57.933
AND LOOK, I HAVE TO TELL YOU:

20:58.000 --> 20:58.566
WOLVERINE SAYS IT'S MOVED TO FIX

20:58.633 --> 20:59.166
THE PROBLEM FOR HOMEOWNERS IN

20:59.233 --> 21:02.133
THAT AREA, ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD

21:02.200 --> 21:03.800
KNOW, IT IS JUST NOT A SIMPLE

21:03.866 --> 21:04.400
THING TO GO ABOUT DOING.

21:04.466 --> 21:05.833
>> THIS IS WHAT I AFFECTIONATELY

21:05.900 --> 21:06.833
CALL MEGATRON -- MY WHOLE HOME

21:06.900 --> 21:08.600
FILTER, THIS RIGHT HERE.

21:08.666 --> 21:10.933
BUT IT GOES THROUGH EACH OF

21:11.000 --> 21:12.766
THESE TANKS -- THESE ARE FULL OF

21:12.833 --> 21:14.400
GRANULATED CARBON AND IT GOES

21:14.466 --> 21:16.366
THROUGH THEM IN ORDER AND THEN

21:16.433 --> 21:20.300
COMES OUT THIS ONE AND IS CLEAN.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.033
SO EVERY WEEK THEY COME AND TEST

21:22.100 --> 21:25.100
IT AT THE INTAKE AND THEN ALSO

21:25.166 --> 21:26.866
AT THE EXIT SO THAT WE KNOW THAT

21:26.933 --> 21:32.666
THE WATER IS EMPTY OF THAT.

21:32.733 --> 21:34.100
>> John: OH, GREAT NEWS!

21:34.166 --> 21:34.666
YOU DID IT, WOLVERINE!

21:34.733 --> 21:35.366
PROBLEM SOLVED.

21:35.433 --> 21:36.833
ALL IT TAKES IS A FOUR-TANK

21:36.900 --> 21:37.966
SYSTEM AFFECTIONATELY NICKNAMED

21:38.033 --> 21:39.233
"MEGATRON," A SPARE ROOM LARGE

21:39.300 --> 21:40.633
ENOUGH TO HOUSE IT, AND A WEEKLY

21:40.700 --> 21:41.266
VISIT FROM A TANK TECHNICIAN FOR

21:41.333 --> 21:42.200
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

21:42.266 --> 21:43.866
WATER PROBLEM?

21:43.933 --> 21:44.833
MORE LIKE "WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?"

21:44.900 --> 21:48.433
THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT WORKS.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.400
BUT CLEARLY, A MEGATRON IN EVERY

21:49.466 --> 21:51.133
HOME IS NOT A VIABLE SOLUTION

21:51.200 --> 21:52.000
FOR THIS OR, INDEED, ANY

21:52.066 --> 21:53.666
PROBLEM.

21:53.733 --> 21:54.800
AND MAYBE BECAUSE OF THAT -- AND

21:54.866 --> 21:56.100
DEFINITELY BECAUSE OF A

21:56.166 --> 21:58.100
COURT-APPROVED SETTLEMENT --

21:58.166 --> 21:59.266
WOLVERINE HAS SINCE GONE TO THE

21:59.333 --> 22:00.666
TROUBLE AND EXPENSE OF SWITCHING

22:00.733 --> 22:01.700
THAT WOMAN FROM HER TAINTED WELL

22:01.766 --> 22:02.700
WATER TO THE MUNICIPAL WATER

22:02.766 --> 22:04.066
SUPPLY.

22:04.133 --> 22:05.866
AND YET, MANY COMPANIES ARE

22:05.933 --> 22:10.366
CONTINUING TO DO THE BARE

22:10.433 --> 22:11.866
MINIMUM HERE OR EVEN TRYING TO

22:11.933 --> 22:12.666
EVADE RESPONSIBILITY.

22:12.733 --> 22:13.500
DuPONT, FOR INSTANCE, SETTLED A

22:13.566 --> 22:14.233
CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT WITH

22:14.300 --> 22:16.333
RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN WHERE IT

22:16.400 --> 22:16.966
WAS DUMPING C8, AND, SHORTLY

22:17.033 --> 22:17.800
AFTERWARD, AGREED TO EVENTUALLY

22:17.866 --> 22:20.100
PHASE OUT USING THE CHEMICAL.

22:20.166 --> 22:21.133
WHICH SOUNDS GOOD.

22:21.200 --> 22:22.733
BUT THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT

22:22.800 --> 22:24.433
ASTERISKS ON THAT.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.233
BECAUSE WHILE THEY DID STOP

22:26.300 --> 22:27.733
USING C8, THEY SIMPLY SWITCHED

22:27.800 --> 22:29.166
TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF PFAs,

22:29.233 --> 22:30.466
SOMETHING CALLED "GEN-X,"

22:30.533 --> 22:31.800
SPINNING THE MANUFACTURE OF IT

22:31.866 --> 22:33.000
OFF INTO A SEPARATE COMPANY,

22:33.066 --> 22:34.400
CHEMOURS.

22:34.466 --> 22:35.766
NOW, DID THEY DO THAT SO THAT

22:35.833 --> 22:37.466
ANY LEGAL LIABILITY WOULDN'T

22:37.533 --> 22:39.400
STICK TO THEM, AND INSTEAD,

22:39.466 --> 22:40.666
SLIDE RIGHT OFF THEM LIKE BUGS

22:40.733 --> 22:43.300
ON A TEFLON TREE?

22:43.366 --> 22:45.166
WHO CAN SAY?

22:45.233 --> 22:47.533
APPARENTLY NOT ME, LEGALLY.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.233
WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT, WHILE

22:48.300 --> 22:50.133
CHEMOURS CLAIMS GEN-X IS SAFER,

22:50.200 --> 22:51.966
SCIENTISTS STILL HAVE

22:52.033 --> 22:52.566
SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT ITS

22:52.633 --> 22:54.966
PRESENCE IN THE WATER SUPPLY.

22:55.033 --> 22:55.966
>> THIS IS, IN MY VIEW, MORE OF

22:56.033 --> 22:57.000
A RISK THAN WE SHOULD BE FORCED

22:57.066 --> 22:58.966
TO TAKE.

22:59.033 --> 23:00.033
THIS COMPOUND'S A MEMBER OF A

23:00.100 --> 23:01.600
CLASS OF COMPOUNDS THAT ARE ALL

23:01.666 --> 23:02.966
THOUGHT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

23:03.033 --> 23:05.966
PEOPLE SICK WITH CANCERS OF

23:06.033 --> 23:06.766
VARIOUS KINDS, OTHER KINDS OF

23:06.833 --> 23:08.400
DYSFUNCTION.

23:08.466 --> 23:09.233
WE DON'T KNOW THE FULL EXTENT OF

23:09.300 --> 23:11.000
IT.

23:11.066 --> 23:12.400
>> SO, WITH WHAT THESE

23:12.466 --> 23:13.300
SCIENTISTS DO KNOW, WE ASK THEM

23:13.366 --> 23:14.500
IF THEY THINK THE WATER IS SAFE

23:14.566 --> 23:15.266
ENOUGH TO DRINK.

23:15.333 --> 23:16.400
>> NOPE.

23:16.466 --> 23:17.400
I DRINK TEQUILA STRAIGHT, BUT I

23:17.466 --> 23:24.066
WON'T DRINK THE TAP WATER.

23:24.133 --> 23:24.866
>> John: WELL, THAT DOESN'T

23:24.933 --> 23:26.133
SOUND GOOD.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.400
IF CASUAL FRIDAY SCIENTIST OVER

23:27.466 --> 23:28.033
HERE WON'T DRINK THE TAP WATER,

23:28.100 --> 23:28.700
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CAUSE FOR

23:28.766 --> 23:29.466
ALARM.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.400
AND WHILE WE'VE JUST FOCUSED ON

23:30.466 --> 23:31.466
A HANDFUL OF INDIVIDUAL PFAs

23:31.533 --> 23:32.700
TONIGHT, THERE ARE HUNDREDS, IF

23:32.766 --> 23:33.733
NOT THOUSANDS, OF THEM.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.266
SO THE PROBLEM IS, IF AND WHEN

23:35.333 --> 23:36.833
GEN-X IS EVENTUALLY FOUND TO BE

23:36.900 --> 23:37.633
HARMFUL, COMPANIES CAN

23:37.700 --> 23:39.666
PRESUMABLY JUST MOVE ON TO

23:39.733 --> 23:40.633
ANOTHER ONE, THEN ANOTHER ONE,

23:40.700 --> 23:43.300
AND SO ON.

23:43.366 --> 23:44.566
AND SO ON.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.000
AND AT THIS POINT, YOU MIGHT BE

23:47.066 --> 23:49.700
THINKING, "HOLY SHIT, THIS IS

23:49.766 --> 23:50.533
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.166
SHOULD I START IMMEDIATELY

23:51.233 --> 23:51.766
THROWING AWAY ALL MY PANS?"

23:51.833 --> 23:52.366
WELL, I'LL START WITH THE GOOD

23:52.433 --> 23:53.366
NEWS: MEGHAN McCAIN IS NO

23:53.433 --> 23:56.266
LONGER ON "THE VIEW."

23:56.333 --> 23:57.300
THIS ROCK LOOKS LIKE

23:57.366 --> 23:57.800
COOKIE MONSTER.

23:57.866 --> 23:58.600
AND NO, YOU DON'T NECESSARILY

23:58.666 --> 23:59.166
NEED TO THROW AWAY ALL YOUR

23:59.233 --> 24:00.100
PANS.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.700
EXPERTS SAY THAT IT'S VERY

24:01.766 --> 24:03.166
UNLIKELY PFAs WILL BE RELEASED

24:03.233 --> 24:05.233
IF THE PANS AREN'T OVERHEATED OR

24:05.300 --> 24:06.933
SCRAPED.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.933
NOW, YOU'RE UNDER SLIGHTLY MORE

24:09.000 --> 24:10.633
RISK OF EXPOSURE FROM CLOTHING

24:10.700 --> 24:12.133
THAT CONTAINS PFAs -- WHICH IS,

24:12.200 --> 24:13.733
UNFORTUNATELY, MOST STAINPROOF

24:13.800 --> 24:15.733
OR WATERPROOF FABRICS, INCLUDING

24:15.800 --> 24:16.766
CERTAIN ITEMS FROM COMPANIES

24:16.833 --> 24:18.733
LIKE LULULEMON, NORTH FACE, AND

24:18.800 --> 24:20.533
PATAGONIA -- OR, INDEED, FROM

24:20.600 --> 24:25.633
FOOD WRAPPERS THAT CONTAIN PFAs,

24:25.700 --> 24:27.466
WHICH ARE, UNFORTUNATELY, USED

24:27.533 --> 24:28.833
BY MULTIPLE CHAINS, INCLUDING

24:28.900 --> 24:31.366
SOME OF THE PACKAGING AT

24:31.433 --> 24:32.433
STARBUCKS, CHICK-FIL-A, AND

24:32.500 --> 24:32.666
SUBWAY.

24:32.733 --> 24:33.266
AND ALL THESE COMPANIES INSIST

24:33.333 --> 24:34.266
THEY'RE WORKING TO REMOVE PFAs

24:34.333 --> 24:34.866
FROM THEIR PRODUCTS COMPLETELY

24:34.933 --> 24:38.333
IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS,

24:38.400 --> 24:38.900
AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S TRUE.

24:38.966 --> 24:39.700
BUT WE HAVE HEARD THINGS LIKE

24:39.766 --> 24:41.933
THAT BEFORE, AND YET, HERE WE

24:42.000 --> 24:42.733
FUCKING ARE.

24:42.800 --> 24:43.600
AND IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S EASY TO

24:43.666 --> 24:44.366
KNOW WHICH PRODUCTS YOU'RE

24:44.433 --> 24:45.266
BUYING DO AND DON'T CONTAIN

24:45.333 --> 24:47.066
PFAs.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.333
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO CARRY

24:48.400 --> 24:49.900
LABELS STATING, "THIS PRODUCT

24:49.966 --> 24:52.000
CONTAINS DEVIL'S PISS," ALTHOUGH

24:52.066 --> 24:52.900
THAT'S ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD

24:52.966 --> 24:54.000
IDEA, AND THEY SHOULD ABSOLUTELY

24:54.066 --> 24:55.500
HAVE TO DO THAT.

24:55.566 --> 24:57.033
BUT THE BIGGER ISSUE IS, NO

24:57.100 --> 24:59.266
MATTER HOW RESPONSIBLE CONSUMERS

24:59.333 --> 25:03.500
CHOOSE TO BE, IF THE FACTORY

25:03.566 --> 25:04.200
THAT MAKES THE CHEMICALS DOESN'T

25:04.266 --> 25:05.066
DISPOSE OF ITS WASTE PROPERLY,

25:05.133 --> 25:06.033
IT'S LIKELY GETTING INTO YOUR

25:06.100 --> 25:06.900
BLOODSTREAM ANYWAY.

25:06.966 --> 25:08.233
WHICH IS PRETTY FRUSTRATING, AS

25:08.300 --> 25:09.333
THE ACTIVIST YOU SAW EARLIER

25:09.400 --> 25:11.000
POINTS OUT:

25:11.066 --> 25:11.800
>> NO ONE SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW,

25:11.866 --> 25:13.900
I'M GOOD WITH A LITTLE TEFLON

25:13.966 --> 25:15.900
CHEMICAL IN MY BABY'S BLOOD."

25:15.966 --> 25:17.733
NO ONE SAID THAT.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.466
THEY SAID, "I LOVE THESE PANS."

25:19.533 --> 25:20.666
>> John: EXACTLY.

25:20.733 --> 25:22.033
NO ONE LOVES PANS SO MUCH THAT

25:22.100 --> 25:23.733
THEY'D BE WILLING TO PUT POISON

25:23.800 --> 25:25.700
IN THEIR BABY'S BLOOD.

25:25.766 --> 25:27.533
WELL, TO BE HONEST, ONE PERSON

25:27.600 --> 25:29.500
DOES BUT, IN HIS DEFENSE, THE

25:29.566 --> 25:34.366
PANS DON'T FUCKING STICK!

25:34.433 --> 25:35.966
NOW, IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

25:36.033 --> 25:38.866
WHAT THE WATER IS LIKE WHERE YOU

25:38.933 --> 25:39.366
LIVE, YOU CAN GO TO THIS

25:39.433 --> 25:41.133
ADDRESS,

25:41.200 --> 25:41.933
EWG.org/PFAsMap, AND IF YOU

25:42.000 --> 25:42.600
DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU

25:42.666 --> 25:43.566
SEE, YOU CAN CONSIDER SOLUTIONS

25:43.633 --> 25:44.200
LIKE DRINKING BOTTLED WATER, OR

25:44.266 --> 25:50.300
USING A REVERSE OSMOSIS FILTER.

25:50.366 --> 25:51.666
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT

25:51.733 --> 25:52.566
SHOULDN'T JUST BE ON US

25:52.633 --> 25:53.066
AS INDIVIDUALS.

25:53.133 --> 25:54.000
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS, PFAs

25:54.066 --> 25:54.666
SHOULDN'T BE IN MOST CONSUMER

25:54.733 --> 25:55.033
PRODUCTS AT ALL.

25:55.100 --> 25:55.900
AND AS COMPANIES SEEM UNLIKELY

25:55.966 --> 26:00.533
TO ALL TAKE THEM OUT

26:00.600 --> 26:01.933
VOLUNTARILY, WE BADLY NEED

26:02.000 --> 26:03.400
LEGISLATION LIMITING THEIR USE

26:03.466 --> 26:04.533
TO ONLY ESSENTIAL ITEMS, LIKE

26:04.600 --> 26:05.666
CERTAIN MEDICAL DEVICES AND

26:05.733 --> 26:06.433
PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.133
BUT NOT JUST THAT -- WE NEED TO

26:07.200 --> 26:07.766
CHANGE THE WAY WE REGULATE PFAs

26:07.833 --> 26:09.200
COMPLETELY.

26:09.266 --> 26:10.766
INSTEAD OF REGULATING THEM ONE

26:10.833 --> 26:12.400
AT A TIME, AS WE DO NOW, WE

26:12.466 --> 26:13.433
SHOULD DO IT AS AN ENTIRE CLASS

26:13.500 --> 26:15.266
OF CHEMICALS.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.866
THIS WOULD ENABLE THE EPA TO

26:16.933 --> 26:18.000
MORE EFFECTIVELY REGULATE NOT

26:18.066 --> 26:19.266
JUST THE PFAs ALREADY IN USE,

26:19.333 --> 26:20.600
BUT REPLACEMENTS LIKE GEN-X WHEN

26:20.666 --> 26:22.833
THEY'RE INTRODUCED.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.566
AND IN THE MEANTIME, IF

26:24.633 --> 26:25.966
COMPANIES ARE GOING TO KEEP

26:26.033 --> 26:27.366
LEANING IN ON THE CONVENIENCE OF

26:27.433 --> 26:29.166
THEIR PRODUCTS WITHOUT

26:29.233 --> 26:30.400
ACKNOWLEDGING THE COST, MAYBE WE

26:30.466 --> 26:31.366
CAN HELP THEM, BY PROVIDING

26:31.433 --> 26:32.000
THEIR ADS WITH SOME MUCH-NEEDED

26:32.066 --> 26:38.433
CONTEXT.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.633
>> CHEMISTRY IS THE PRACTICE OF

26:39.700 --> 26:43.200
MAGIC.
