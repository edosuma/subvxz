-Hi.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.029
Gosh.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.657
Did you feel bad
for the street vendor again?

02:38.199 --> 02:40.618
It's not that.
I bought it because it's tasty.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.870
-It is tasty.
-Yeah.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.497
What's with the uniform?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.000
I told you I'm transferring
to the security division.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.002
That was today?

02:53.923 --> 02:55.175

02:57.260 --> 02:59.095
She's transferring
to the security division,

marking the official beginning
of her elite career path.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.018
You know that, right?

03:05.101 --> 03:06.477
Yes, of course.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.397
It's something worth celebrating

03:09.480 --> 03:10.607
with the whole family.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.651
I mean, your wife was appointed to Seoul

03:13.735 --> 03:15.862
upon her promotion as assistant inspector.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.116
Have you been in touch
with your father lately?

03:20.950 --> 03:22.869
No, I'm not.

03:23.369 --> 03:25.747
DEOKHOON: Well, he's getting old,

03:25.830 --> 03:27.540
so he should pull himself together

03:27.624 --> 03:29.250
and try to stay healthy.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.294
Yes.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.296
All right.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.674
How's the prep
for the promotion exam going?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.886
I should be preparing,
but I can't seem to find time for it.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.764

Stop being so condescending
as if you're much older.

03:55.109 --> 03:57.737
Your new executive title
doesn't mean you're mature.

03:57.820 --> 03:58.821
As I always say,

03:58.905 --> 04:01.950
if KNPU accepted women
when I was applying for university,

04:02.033 --> 04:03.368
I'd be an executive too by now.

didn't gain you anything.

you should've come to

Yes, she's all right.

Just forget
what my dad said about your father.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.314
I've forgotten about it too.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.492
It's from my church back in high school.

know about the incident at your wedding.

38:42.945 --> 38:46.949
Even I wouldn't give a promotion

38:47.033 --> 38:48.826
to a drug addict's son.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.800
If this case ends well,

39:04.884 --> 39:07.470
you'll get a sizeable bonus
and a special promotion.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.931
You can't stay in the lower ranks forever.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.895
Officer Park,

39:15.978 --> 39:19.523
chances like this don't come every day.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.610
You can rise through the ranks

39:23.486 --> 39:25.404
with the help of the prosecution.

39:27.615 --> 39:29.950
BIG BROTHER: I mean,
your wife was appointed to Seoul

39:30.034 --> 39:32.161
upon her promotion as assistant inspector.

39:32.828 --> 39:33.829
How great is that?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.058
SOUTHERN SEOUL PLAZA

41:01.125 --> 41:02.126
Please.

41:26.275 --> 41:27.693
I'll do it on one condition.

41:27.776 --> 41:28.777
A condition?

41:28.986 --> 41:30.154
I don't need any bonus.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.409
But I want to move up two ranks.

41:39.079 --> 41:40.664
-Two ranks?
-Yes.

41:42.416 --> 41:46.253
Clearly, I'll be the only one
busting my chops in this case.

41:47.546 --> 41:49.423
I think I deserve that much.

41:52.426 --> 41:54.595
If this ends well,

41:54.678 --> 41:56.680
won't you rise through the ranks?

41:57.765 --> 41:58.891
Why don't you...

42:00.851 --> 42:05.397
rise through the ranks
with the help of a police underling?

42:13.447 --> 42:14.823
Has there been a precedent?

42:14.907 --> 42:16.784
In 1989 for catching Im Jongseok,

42:16.867 --> 42:19.995
the head of the National Council
of Student Representatives.

42:28.295 --> 42:29.296
All right.

42:41.058 --> 42:43.477
DOHYUNG: Lately, premium-quality meth
with over 95% purity

42:43.561 --> 42:47.106
has been widespread
in Gangnam much like Japan.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.899
Namely, Gangnam Crystal.

42:48.983 --> 42:51.694
CHANGSIK: We thought it might be linked
to gangsters in Gangnam,

42:51.777 --> 42:53.862
so we did some digging.

42:53.946 --> 42:55.281
DOHYUNG: Before, Jang Kyungchul,

42:55.364 --> 42:57.950
also known as "Sergeant Jang,"
was the boss of the area.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.702
But Jung Gicheul took him down,

42:59.785 --> 43:02.329
which Busan's Song Donghyuk
turned a blind eye to.

43:02.413 --> 43:05.165
CHANGSIK: Jung Gicheul
is now the head of Gangnam Union,

43:05.249 --> 43:08.627
and the main members of this new gang
are Yeoksam High graduates.

43:09.128 --> 43:11.797
They've been like brothers
since they were young,

43:11.880 --> 43:13.632
so they have a strong bond
like a family.

43:13.716 --> 43:16.802
So we thought our usual
investigation methods wouldn't work,

43:16.927 --> 43:19.388
which is why we planned this.

43:20.514 --> 43:22.308
DOHYUNG: When Jung was trying
to get rid of Jang,

43:22.391 --> 43:24.310
one of their members was stabbed to death.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.853
His name was Kwon Taeho.

43:25.936 --> 43:28.564
He was Jung Gicheul's best friend
from high school.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.693
The Gangnam Union members
said Sergeant Jang was the murderer,

43:32.776 --> 43:35.946
but since he went missing,
the case remains unsolved.

43:37.156 --> 43:38.157
JUNMO: Gangnam Union...

43:38.699 --> 43:41.243
Is there anything else
special about them?

43:41.327 --> 43:43.996
CHANGSIK: Gangnam Union seized power
in Gangnam really quickly.

43:46.290 --> 43:47.458
On the outside,

43:47.541 --> 43:50.919
it almost looks like a social club
for young entrepreneurs.

43:52.254 --> 43:55.883
But during the past six months in Gangnam,

43:55.966 --> 43:58.385
they have taken over
almost every nightclub there.

43:59.345 --> 44:00.971
JUNMO: Where did they get all that money?

44:01.055 --> 44:02.514
KARAOKE, LUCKY DISCO, LUCKY DISCO

44:02.598 --> 44:05.267
I'm sure it has something to do
with Gangnam Crystal.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.647
DOHYUNG: Junmo, you'll now become
Kwon Taeho's fake cousin

44:09.730 --> 44:11.857
of the same age named Kwon Seungho

44:11.940 --> 44:13.734
and get close to the Gangnam Union.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.695
This is the background
we made up for Kwon Seungho.

44:16.779 --> 44:18.739
He works in a fishing crew.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.157
Kwon Seungho.

44:20.240 --> 44:23.077
DOHYUNG: I'll take care of his backstory
in advance.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.161
Don't worry about that.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.246
CHANGSIK: You know Sikgaek
in Yeoksam-dong?

44:26.914 --> 44:29.583
They recently took over that business.

44:30.042 --> 44:33.003
Some of the members have dinner there
multiple times a week,

44:33.087 --> 44:34.963
and we suspect they're the higher-ups.

44:35.881 --> 44:38.342
Security is key
to the success of this operation.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.553
There might be cops
who are close with the gangsters,

44:41.637 --> 44:43.722
so let's keep it discreet from the start.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.807
Hey.

44:46.058 --> 44:48.644
You're taking sick leave
when you look so healthy?

44:50.396 --> 44:51.397
Junmo.

44:51.897 --> 44:52.898
Are you okay?

44:52.981 --> 44:53.982
Hey.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.361
-Take care, okay?
-Okay.

44:57.444 --> 44:58.904
YOUNGPYO: Get well soon.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.030
Asthma?

45:01.865 --> 45:04.201
Gangnam Union's boss, Jung Gicheul.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.539
According to his travel records,

45:08.622 --> 45:10.290
in the past six months,

45:10.374 --> 45:12.543
he's visited Japan and China twice.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.588
China?

45:17.131 --> 45:19.800
If they're cooking
Gangnam Crystal themselves,

45:19.883 --> 45:23.971
they might be buying the ingredient,
ephedrine, from China.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.850
CHANGSIK: Gangnam Union and Jung Gicheul.

45:29.435 --> 45:32.396
The worst drug crime in Korean history.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.234
Now, let's think about

45:38.193 --> 45:40.237
how Kwon Seongho

45:40.320 --> 45:42.656
should first approach Jung Gicheul.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.826
Let me try my way.

46:35.375 --> 46:37.044

46:38.712 --> 46:40.380
Bring me the owner.

46:40.464 --> 46:42.591
I'm the owner. I'm not sure what you mean.

46:44.009 --> 46:46.804
I know Gangnam Union took over this place.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.597
Isn't Jung Gicheul the owner?

46:49.097 --> 46:50.474
Bring me Jung Gicheul.

46:51.975 --> 46:52.976
Hurry.

46:53.560 --> 46:54.561
He's over there.

46:59.066 --> 47:00.067
MAN: Who are you?

47:00.567 --> 47:03.237
We have customers,
so stand up quietly and leave.

47:05.155 --> 47:08.242
If I stand up,
you'll be lying down, you rats.

47:08.534 --> 47:11.703
-(SNICKERS)
-Just bring Jung Gicheul to me already.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.664
What?

47:14.998 --> 47:17.167
Damn it. Fine.

47:19.169 --> 47:20.254
You fucking...

47:24.716 --> 47:25.717
Fuck.

47:28.053 --> 47:31.682
Boss, why don't we eat
somewhere other than Sikgaek today?

47:31.765 --> 47:33.058
Why?

47:33.433 --> 47:35.477
Bring Jung Gicheul to me.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.396
Bring the owner here.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.648
Do you hear me?

47:39.731 --> 47:41.483
Go and get Jung Gicheul.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.278
Apparently, some nut
is causing a scene there.

47:44.361 --> 47:47.030
I'll go take care of it
after we have dinner.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.241
Who is he?

47:49.324 --> 47:53.370

47:57.833 --> 47:59.501
No, stop!

47:59.585 --> 48:00.878
Don't throw that.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.256
He wants to speak to Gicheul.

48:05.757 --> 48:06.884
Me?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.010
Yes, Boss.

48:08.468 --> 48:09.553
Why?

48:09.636 --> 48:11.597
You know those guys never tell you why.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.764
Just forget it.
