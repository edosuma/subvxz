00:00.125 --> 00:01.532
- [Gordon] Tonight on "Hotel Hell,"

00:01.532 --> 00:04.806
I'm trying to breathe life back
into a historic country inn.

00:04.806 --> 00:06.892
You know, it smells like shit.

00:06.892 --> 00:09.884
The hotel's arrogant
owner, Robert Dean II.

00:09.884 --> 00:12.387
- I've always thought you
should live with nice things

00:12.387 --> 00:13.263
if you can afford them.

00:13.263 --> 00:16.047
- Treats the inn like his personal castle

00:16.047 --> 00:18.362
and treats his loyal staff with disdain.

00:18.362 --> 00:20.113
Go on then, you pompous fuck.

00:20.113 --> 00:22.699
- Excuse me, don't talk to me like that.

00:22.699 --> 00:24.263
- Well, what's wrong with it?

00:24.263 --> 00:26.505
Is this hotel beyond my help?

00:26.505 --> 00:29.300
- I'm barely surviving,
financially and emotionally.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.250
- I mean, I'm gonna lose everything.

00:32.392 --> 00:35.260
(dramatic music)

00:50.485 --> 00:53.266
(tiger roaring)

00:57.870 --> 01:00.602
- [Gordon] The historic Juniper
Hill Inn sits on a hilltop

01:00.602 --> 01:03.323
above the quaint village
of Windsor, Vermont.

01:03.323 --> 01:05.346
Built in 1902, the country mansion

01:05.346 --> 01:10.560
boasts 28 luxurious bedrooms
and two grand dining rooms.

01:10.966 --> 01:15.043
- It is filled with original
works of art and antiques,

01:15.043 --> 01:16.847
all museum quality.

01:16.847 --> 01:18.589
- [Gordon] Antiques dealer, Robert Dean II

01:18.589 --> 01:20.288
and his boyfriend, Ari Nikki,

01:20.288 --> 01:22.029
bought the business six years ago.

01:22.029 --> 01:24.438
- I've always thought that you
should live with nice things,

01:24.438 --> 01:25.307
if you can afford them.

01:25.307 --> 01:26.941
- I think it looks good there, Robert.

01:26.941 --> 01:27.962
- I thought you'd like it.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.924
The guests that we don't
want here are people

01:30.924 --> 01:33.207
who don't have a lot of money.

01:33.207 --> 01:34.730
- [Gordon] The inn may look the part,

01:34.730 --> 01:37.211
but despite Robert's dreams
of an elite country estate,

01:37.211 --> 01:39.307
the hotel is barely functioning.

01:39.307 --> 01:42.373
- Robert Dean has no hotel
or no restaurant experience.

01:42.373 --> 01:44.392
- The price is maybe a
little bit high for locals.

01:44.392 --> 01:45.519
- $350?

01:45.519 --> 01:47.625
- Two night minimum, so that's.

01:47.625 --> 01:48.963
- [Both] $700.

01:48.963 --> 01:51.048
- The lack of communication
is very frustrating.

01:51.048 --> 01:52.633
- Where are you?

01:52.633 --> 01:54.249
- I know the customers see that every day.

01:54.249 --> 01:56.387
- I need my key too, because with this one

01:56.387 --> 01:57.570
I can't even get in my room.

01:57.570 --> 01:58.439
- Okay.

01:58.439 --> 01:59.849
- [Gordon] With bookings
at an all-time low,

01:59.849 --> 02:02.038
the hotel is in serious financial trouble.

02:03.196 --> 02:04.718
But that doesn't stop Robert

02:04.718 --> 02:06.418
from living a millionaire's dream.

02:06.418 --> 02:10.112
- Robert believes this
place is his playground.

02:11.900 --> 02:13.320
A playground for his friends.

02:13.320 --> 02:15.622
- We've gotta have a
lot of clothes made by.

02:15.622 --> 02:18.187
(group laughing)

02:18.187 --> 02:22.611
- He comps all their meals and
rooms, but we never get tips.

02:22.611 --> 02:24.415
- They're having a hard time paying me,

02:24.415 --> 02:26.803
because they give away all
of their money and food

02:26.803 --> 02:27.960
to their friends, showing off,

02:27.960 --> 02:29.618
using this as their private castle.

02:29.618 --> 02:31.192
- [Gordon] With hardly any paying guests,

02:31.192 --> 02:33.643
it's no wonder that
this inn is in the red.

02:33.643 --> 02:34.852
- Yes, we are losing money,

02:34.852 --> 02:36.993
more or less like $200,000 a year.

02:37.876 --> 02:39.920
- I think that the
place is gonna be closed

02:39.920 --> 02:41.964
and that's very sad.

02:41.964 --> 02:43.465
- Gordon is gonna come into this place

02:43.465 --> 02:45.623
and say this place is fucked.

02:45.623 --> 02:48.731
- If I don't stop this
business from bleeding money,

02:48.731 --> 02:49.631
it's doomed.

02:51.441 --> 02:54.851
(jaunty music)

02:54.851 --> 02:56.715
I'd love to own an inn
in a setting like this.

02:56.715 --> 03:00.399
If you get it right, you'd
make an absolute fortune.

03:00.399 --> 03:02.237
Before I get to Juniper
hill, I want to find out

03:02.237 --> 03:04.635
what the town's folk
think of their local inn.

03:05.716 --> 03:06.822
- Hello.
- How are you?

03:06.822 --> 03:07.906
- [Shopkeeper] Very well and yourself?

03:07.906 --> 03:09.741
- Yeah, well, I have
been driving all morning.

03:09.741 --> 03:12.275
How's Juniper Hill Inn?

03:12.275 --> 03:14.475
- You're gonna love it, it's beautiful.

03:14.475 --> 03:15.633
- And reputation?

03:15.633 --> 03:18.500
- It tends to be a little on
the high end for our area.

03:18.500 --> 03:21.701
But I would love to have
a place to go to locally.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.848
- Do they not invite locals up there?

03:22.848 --> 03:24.913
- I feel that I'd be interrupting.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.227
I feel like I'd be intruding.

03:26.227 --> 03:27.377
- Oh, really?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.450
What a shame. Thank you so much.

03:30.450 --> 03:32.358
- Have a great day and welcome to Windsor.

03:32.358 --> 03:33.473
- Thank you very much, indeed, take care.

03:33.473 --> 03:35.243
- Enjoy your visit.
- Thank you.

03:37.574 --> 03:39.990
Here we are, Juniper Hill Inn.

03:39.990 --> 03:43.473
Now who in the hell would
bring an RV all the way up here

03:43.473 --> 03:44.995
and not stay in that stunning hotel?

03:44.995 --> 03:45.864
Look at it.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.093
My God, that's beautiful, wow.

03:49.093 --> 03:50.848
Okay, around to the front door.

03:53.744 --> 03:55.005
Can't believe they
haven't cleared the snow

03:55.005 --> 03:56.677
for guests to come in.

03:56.677 --> 03:59.750
(dramatic music)

03:59.750 --> 04:00.992
Wow.

04:00.992 --> 04:03.685
(jaunty music)

04:06.136 --> 04:07.580
You're kidding me.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.449
It's locked.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.739
That's not very welcoming.

04:11.997 --> 04:14.865
(dramatic music)

04:16.253 --> 04:18.946
(jaunty music)

04:24.667 --> 04:26.047
Why would you have a big mansion

04:26.047 --> 04:29.637
that guests can't arrive
through the front fucking door?

04:30.968 --> 04:33.471
Jesus, who wants to enter
through the back door?

04:34.774 --> 04:37.885
- Mr. Ramsay's here, I need
you to do Room One, right away.

04:41.562 --> 04:44.054
- [Gordon] Well, at
least this door's open.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.316
Finally.
- Hello there.

04:45.316 --> 04:47.057
- How are you?
- How are you, Mr. Ramsay?

04:47.057 --> 04:48.757
- Gordon, please, bloody
hell, what a nightmare.

04:48.757 --> 04:49.852
- I'm Robert Dean.

04:49.852 --> 04:50.720
- Robert Dean.

04:52.052 --> 04:52.921
- Were you over there?

04:52.921 --> 04:54.263
- [Gordon] I was at the front door, yes.

04:54.263 --> 04:56.619
- Okay, this is actually our
entrance and in the winter,

04:56.619 --> 04:59.591
because of snow, we
have to keep that locked

04:59.591 --> 05:02.886
because otherwise the snow load
comes off and kills people.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.585
- Kills people?
- Yeah, it can.

05:04.585 --> 05:05.617
- Have you killed anyone so far?

05:05.617 --> 05:08.808
- No. (laughs)

05:08.808 --> 05:10.013
- Where's all this stuff from?

05:10.013 --> 05:13.141
(suspenseful music)

05:14.335 --> 05:17.129
An aftermath of a antiques fair.

05:17.129 --> 05:18.488
This looks like it could
be a beautiful room,

05:18.488 --> 05:20.289
but you can't tell because it's stuffed

05:20.289 --> 05:21.404
with so much clutter.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.384
That's the reception desk?

05:22.384 --> 05:23.253
- [Robert] No.

05:23.253 --> 05:24.428
- [Gordon] My God, so what is that?

05:24.428 --> 05:25.940
- That is our bar, right now.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.796
- [Gordon] You are kidding
me, this is the bar?

05:27.796 --> 05:29.006
- Yes.
- With what, that?

05:29.006 --> 05:30.445
- [Robert] Martinis.
- Martinis.

05:30.445 --> 05:31.967
Well, God bless him.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.458
Made of pigs, pig martini?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.637
- Well, we have three
rescue pot bellied pigs.

05:35.637 --> 05:36.597
- You have three pigs here?

05:36.597 --> 05:38.025
- Right.

05:38.025 --> 05:39.537
- What is that for?

05:39.537 --> 05:40.872
Were you born with this in your mouth?

05:40.872 --> 05:41.740
- Yeah, don't I wish.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.609
- [Gordon] Honestly?

05:42.609 --> 05:44.229
- Actually, no, that was a gift from-

05:44.229 --> 05:45.098
- A giant?

05:45.098 --> 05:46.523
- So, yeah. (laughs)

05:46.523 --> 05:47.806
- [Gordon] Robert
obviously loves to show off

05:47.806 --> 05:49.855
all his expensive antiques, but as a guest

05:49.855 --> 05:51.549
I don't feel comfortable.

05:51.549 --> 05:53.739
I feel like I'm in a museum.

05:53.739 --> 05:56.168
- [Robert] This is the
main formal dining room.

05:56.168 --> 05:58.681
- This big chair here is for one?

05:58.681 --> 06:02.424
- Just kind of, we're known
as a romantic destination and-

06:02.424 --> 06:03.293
- Just out of interest, how do?

06:03.293 --> 06:04.718
- Well, we would move the table.

06:04.718 --> 06:05.587
- Move it in for me, please.

06:05.587 --> 06:06.652
- [Robert] Yes.

06:06.652 --> 06:09.346
(lilting music)

06:09.346 --> 06:12.497
- Wow, so you got a sofa on the table.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.071
- We thought it was kind of nice to have,

06:14.071 --> 06:15.722
like, a cosy banquette.

06:16.906 --> 06:17.836
- Ugh.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.119
- Well, three US
presidents have dined here.

06:20.119 --> 06:21.235
- [Gordon] Oh really, which ones?

06:21.235 --> 06:23.070
- Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.239
- Teddy Roosevelt dined in here, wow.

06:25.239 --> 06:26.834
- I wanted to try to give him

06:26.834 --> 06:29.670
a little bit of sense of
the history of Juniper Hill.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.798
- Wow, okay, so that's the dining room.

06:31.798 --> 06:33.654
- [Robert] Well, we have two dining rooms.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.281
- God, you must be busy
with two dining rooms.

06:36.281 --> 06:38.356
- [Robert] Well, I wish we were busy.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.274
- [Gordon] Bloody hell.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.176
- We have spurts of being incredibly busy.

06:43.184 --> 06:45.561
Where we lack is all the other times.

06:45.561 --> 06:46.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:47.584 --> 06:49.732
- This place looks like
a millionaire's mansion,

06:49.732 --> 06:51.119
not a struggling business.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.715
I've got to scratch beneath the surface.

06:53.715 --> 06:56.416
This place, per week, is turning how much?

06:56.416 --> 07:00.076
- We're lucky if we're doing,
you know, 15,000 a month.

07:00.076 --> 07:02.161
- What does it cost to
keep the place open?

07:02.161 --> 07:03.562
- 30.

07:03.562 --> 07:04.865
- Really?
- Yep.

07:06.290 --> 07:10.743
- So you're losing $200,000 a year?

07:10.743 --> 07:12.171
- It's been a nightmare.

07:12.171 --> 07:14.100
We maintained our room rates, thinking

07:14.100 --> 07:16.868
that the economy wouldn't
be this long a haul.

07:16.868 --> 07:19.543
- But we've all experienced
those kind of difficulties,

07:19.543 --> 07:21.253
myself included, but you navigate

07:21.253 --> 07:22.254
your way of that recession.

07:22.254 --> 07:25.143
- Unfortunately, my partner lost his job.

07:25.143 --> 07:27.989
We expected him to have his
job for a little longer.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.451
- He must've gained a substantial
pay-off or retirement?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.848
- It's all been put into this.

07:32.848 --> 07:34.089
- How much?

07:34.089 --> 07:34.975
- Over a million dollars.

07:34.975 --> 07:37.165
- A million dollars, into this already?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.249
- Yes.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.834
- And does he have an
active role in the business?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.649
- He tries to maintain the accounting

07:41.649 --> 07:44.673
and he helps just about with everything.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.070
We're in trouble.

07:46.070 --> 07:46.938
- Trouble?

07:46.938 --> 07:48.259
You'd never guess by
the look of this place.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.918
It's more like Buckingham
Palace than the Skid Row.

07:50.918 --> 07:51.787
Do you know what, Robert, honestly,

07:51.787 --> 07:53.369
I'd like to go straight to my room

07:53.369 --> 07:54.686
if you wouldn't mind, please.

07:54.686 --> 07:55.554
- Okay, all right.

07:55.554 --> 07:56.737
- [Gordon] Wow, this place goes on.

07:56.737 --> 07:57.904
- [Robert] It does, it's the largest

07:57.904 --> 07:59.948
colonial revival mansion in New England.

07:59.948 --> 08:00.845
- [Gordon] And more paintings.

08:00.845 --> 08:03.076
- [Robert] And you're in
the Maxwell Evarts suite,

08:03.076 --> 08:04.630
which is the original.

08:04.630 --> 08:06.406
- Okay, wow, beautiful room.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.426
I mean, this is a,

08:12.426 --> 08:15.783
this is a beautiful room,
but what is that smell?

08:15.783 --> 08:17.589
I mean, seriously.

08:17.589 --> 08:18.457
- It does smell.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.396
- Yeah, but it smells like shit.

08:20.396 --> 08:22.971
I mean, that is horrific.

08:22.971 --> 08:25.227
Oh my God, it smells like sewage.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.249
Coming up, Robert's staff turn on him.

08:30.249 --> 08:32.022
- I'm supposed to tell
you the truth, right?

08:32.022 --> 08:33.544
- The truth is all I want to know.

08:33.544 --> 08:34.879
- I'm telling you exactly how I feel

08:34.879 --> 08:37.288
and how the people that I work with feel.

08:37.288 --> 08:38.873
The entire staff is ready to walk out.

08:38.873 --> 08:41.207
- You can talk to him,
he's your fucking chef.

08:41.207 --> 08:44.044
- I'm beyond angry, I'm beyond pissed off.

08:44.044 --> 08:46.130
- And I have to step in.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.882
How dare you?

08:47.882 --> 08:49.609
You still haven't got it.

08:49.609 --> 08:51.229
Get your head out of your ass

08:51.229 --> 08:53.106
and start getting a little fucking real.

08:53.106 --> 08:54.628
- Excuse me.

08:54.628 --> 08:56.710
- Go on then, you pompous fuck.

08:56.710 --> 08:59.578
(dramatic music)

09:02.290 --> 09:03.957
I'm at Vermont's Juniper Hill Inn,

09:03.957 --> 09:06.953
and I've just met its
owner, Robert Dean II,

09:06.953 --> 09:10.175
who's filled his hotel with
expensive art and antiques.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.666
Were you born with this in your mouth?

09:11.666 --> 09:14.846
But he can't fill his rooms,
and his business is struggling.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.995
You're losing $200,000 a year?

09:17.995 --> 09:18.986
- It's been a nightmare.

09:18.986 --> 09:20.299
- And no wonder, because

09:20.299 --> 09:22.041
although the room he's
put me in looks nice.

09:22.041 --> 09:22.909
Beautiful room.

09:22.909 --> 09:24.616
It has one major drawback.

09:24.616 --> 09:25.951
What is that smell?

09:25.951 --> 09:28.485
It smells like raw sewage.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.746
- We had a plumbing issue and-

09:29.746 --> 09:32.812
- It's like someone's
shat under the bed, and-

09:32.812 --> 09:33.680
How much?

09:33.680 --> 09:37.177
- This room goes for $350 a night.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.267
- $350 a night for a
room that smells of shit.

09:40.267 --> 09:41.498
You are kidding me?

09:41.498 --> 09:42.801
- [Robert] We haven't rented it, though.

09:42.801 --> 09:43.948
- Bloody hell.

09:43.948 --> 09:46.742
- It's been out of use for four months.

09:46.742 --> 09:48.578
- Four months?

09:48.578 --> 09:49.446
Oh, come on.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.872
- It has been.
- This is crazy.

09:50.872 --> 09:51.740
- It is crazy.

09:51.740 --> 09:52.609
- It doesn't make sense.

09:52.609 --> 09:53.822
I've got to get out of
here, it stinks of shit.

09:53.822 --> 09:54.691
Is there another room, please?

09:54.691 --> 09:55.626
- Yes, I have Room Two.

09:55.626 --> 09:56.495
- Bloody hell.

09:56.495 --> 09:59.800
- I didn't realise.
- $350, to be caked in shit.

10:01.591 --> 10:04.656
Wow, it's gorgeous, and this
one doesn't smell like crap.

10:04.656 --> 10:06.199
I'm gonna quickly unpack,

10:06.199 --> 10:09.672
and then I would like to
have a quick bite of lunch.

10:09.672 --> 10:11.593
- [Robert] Okay, I'll notify the chef.

10:11.593 --> 10:12.696
- What time's the
restaurant close for lunch?

10:12.696 --> 10:13.564
I know it's two o'clock.

10:13.564 --> 10:15.563
- Well, we actually don't
serve lunch normally,

10:15.563 --> 10:17.867
but we're happy to prepare you something.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.108
- Is that a joke?

10:19.108 --> 10:19.977
- We serve breakfast and dinner.

10:19.977 --> 10:22.132
- No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:22.132 --> 10:24.144
You don't actually serve lunch?

10:24.144 --> 10:25.013
- No.

10:25.013 --> 10:25.882
- The restaurant's closed for lunch?

10:25.882 --> 10:27.450
- Yes, if someone requests lunch

10:27.450 --> 10:29.139
we'll make lunch for them, but-

10:29.139 --> 10:31.235
- Could you prepare lunch for me?

10:31.235 --> 10:33.310
- Ah, yes, I can, I'll tell the chef.

10:33.310 --> 10:34.582
- Please.
- Okay.

10:34.582 --> 10:36.813
- [Gordon] Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

10:36.813 --> 10:38.774
- Not open for lunch.

10:38.774 --> 10:40.703
- [Robert] Gordon is gonna want lunch.

10:40.703 --> 10:41.571
- Huh?

10:41.571 --> 10:42.440
- Gordon wants lunch.

10:43.487 --> 10:46.563
- What am I supposed to
do with that information?

10:46.563 --> 10:49.337
(birds chirping)

10:49.337 --> 10:52.068
- (sighs) That is a
welcome breath of fresh air

10:52.068 --> 10:54.727
on the back of that disgusting
smell of crap in that room,

10:54.727 --> 10:55.596
I can't believe it.

10:55.596 --> 10:57.209
And the rooms are gorgeous, and yet

10:57.209 --> 11:00.931
how could you have a room that
has been smelling for months

11:00.931 --> 11:03.658
that bad and then he sticks me in it?

11:03.658 --> 11:04.527
What a muppet.

11:07.907 --> 11:10.566
Despite the hideous smell
in that first guest room,

11:11.577 --> 11:13.371
I've still worked up quite an appetite.

11:13.371 --> 11:14.445
Hello.

11:14.445 --> 11:15.998
- Hi, how are you?

11:15.998 --> 11:16.867
Barbara.
- Barbara.

11:16.867 --> 11:17.792
How glamorous are you?

11:17.792 --> 11:19.752
- How nice to see you.
- [Gordon] Likewise.

11:19.752 --> 11:21.389
- I have a mad crush on Gordon.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.662
As he knows, I'm a cougar.

11:23.662 --> 11:24.630
- How old are you now?

11:24.630 --> 11:26.738
- I'm old.
- You're not old.

11:26.738 --> 11:28.501
- Last week I turned 70.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.548
- You're kidding me.

11:30.548 --> 11:31.417
You look a million dollars.

11:31.417 --> 11:33.537
- You have made my year.

11:33.537 --> 11:35.195
- 70?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.618
Watch out Joan Collins, I'm
telling you now, bloody hell.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.481
Barbara, what's wrong with this place?

11:42.481 --> 11:43.370
In a nutshell.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.975
- Don't get any people,

11:44.975 --> 11:46.956
like pulling teeth to get my paycheck.

11:47.947 --> 11:48.816
- You don't get paid?

11:48.816 --> 11:50.366
- It takes forever to get my paycheck.

11:50.366 --> 11:52.816
And when I do, usually
something's left out.

11:52.816 --> 11:54.860
- But hold on a minute,
you don't get paid,

11:54.860 --> 11:55.729
and when you do-

11:55.729 --> 11:58.572
- Not on time, we're supposed
to get paid every two weeks.

11:58.572 --> 11:59.949
- So what do you earn a fortnight?

11:59.949 --> 12:02.831
- I made 6,000 this year.

12:02.831 --> 12:04.839
- $6,000 a year?

12:04.839 --> 12:06.789
That's ridiculous.

12:06.789 --> 12:08.666
- You know, you gotta
have the money flowing

12:08.666 --> 12:11.293
and it's almost come to a
standstill at this point.

12:11.293 --> 12:14.380
My last paycheck was $48.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.538
- Unbelievable, Robert's
obviously got enough money

12:16.538 --> 12:20.511
to fill the guest rooms with
fine art and antique furniture,

12:20.511 --> 12:22.596
but he doesn't pay his staff.

12:22.596 --> 12:24.525
I am starving, what would you recommend?

12:24.525 --> 12:26.538
- The crab cakes with a little salad.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.289
So this is the dinner menu.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.054
- Okay, 'cause we're not open for lunch.

12:30.054 --> 12:30.922
- Right.

12:30.922 --> 12:31.981
- And the lamb sounds great as well.

12:31.981 --> 12:33.586
- You want the lamb?

12:33.586 --> 12:34.598
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:34.598 --> 12:37.326
- Darling, is this a prix fixe menu, or?

12:37.326 --> 12:38.194
- Yeah.

12:38.194 --> 12:39.063
- 'Cause there's no prices on here.

12:39.063 --> 12:41.323
What sort of restaurant doesn't
have prices on the menu?

12:41.323 --> 12:42.887
It's like a club for millionaires where,

12:42.887 --> 12:45.025
if you have to ask, you can't afford it.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.216
I've got a supplement of $15
for my lamb, how much is?

12:48.216 --> 12:49.582
- An upcharge for the lamb.

12:49.582 --> 12:50.572
- Is Robert nearby?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.963
(suspenseful music)

12:55.963 --> 12:57.962
How much is it for three courses?

12:57.962 --> 13:00.426
- $59.
- $59.

13:00.426 --> 13:01.489
So if we had the lamb.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.116
- It would be.
- 74.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.504
- People are horrified
at the price of the food.

13:05.504 --> 13:07.839
This is why a lot of people think

13:07.839 --> 13:10.060
that Juniper Hill is snobbish.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.885
- When we typically take a reservation,

13:11.885 --> 13:13.960
we will tell people it's
a three course meal.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.264
- That's for the residents.

13:15.264 --> 13:17.151
I'm talking about a local coming in here.

13:17.151 --> 13:20.102
- We're reservation
only, so nobody walks in.

13:20.102 --> 13:21.092
We don't have walk-ins.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.817
- What, how can you expect
to appeal to the locals?

13:25.294 --> 13:27.380
- We haven't identified
the appropriate people

13:27.380 --> 13:28.610
to come here or-

13:28.610 --> 13:29.479
- Hold on a minute.

13:29.479 --> 13:30.347
What do you mean appropriate people?

13:30.347 --> 13:32.906
- People who can afford
$59 for three courses.

13:32.906 --> 13:34.043
- Appropriate people?

13:34.043 --> 13:36.201
What a snob, where does he think he is?

13:36.201 --> 13:37.411
The Ritz?

13:37.411 --> 13:39.493
And where's your table,
which one's your table?

13:39.493 --> 13:43.928
- Well, most of the time I eat
in our RV, our motor coach.

13:43.928 --> 13:45.419
- Say that again?

13:45.419 --> 13:47.389
- We have a motor coach to the side.

13:47.389 --> 13:48.703
- Christ, and where did it come from?

13:48.703 --> 13:50.278
Is it yours, do you rent it?

13:50.278 --> 13:51.185
- Yeah, it's ours.

13:51.185 --> 13:52.787
I mean, we owe on it, but we bought it.

13:52.787 --> 13:53.906
- You bought it?

13:53.906 --> 13:54.775
- Yeah.

13:54.775 --> 13:55.867
- How much was that?

13:55.867 --> 13:57.371
- Over $100,000.

13:57.371 --> 13:59.985
- $100,000?

13:59.985 --> 14:01.132
You're three years away from 50,

14:01.132 --> 14:03.677
you should not be living in an RV.

14:03.677 --> 14:08.890
- We don't live in an
RV, it is a motor coach,

14:08.932 --> 14:11.184
which is the higher end version of an RV.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.020
It is that psychological break for us

14:14.020 --> 14:17.054
and it gives me a place to
relax and kind of unwind.

14:17.054 --> 14:19.661
I actually love it, I could
live there the rest of my life,

14:19.661 --> 14:20.530
to be honest with you.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.028
It's quiet, it's clean.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.582
- I suppose if this
place doesn't get fixed

14:23.582 --> 14:25.484
then you might be in
there full time, yeah.

14:25.484 --> 14:28.351
(dramatic music)

14:31.246 --> 14:33.164
I've just sat down for lunch
at the Juniper Hill Inn.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.033
Hello.

14:34.033 --> 14:36.115
And already I found out the
staff aren't paid on time.

14:36.115 --> 14:37.533
- Like pulling teeth to get my paycheck.

14:37.533 --> 14:41.475
- And the owners live in a camper outside.

14:41.475 --> 14:42.382
How much was that?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.883
- Over $100,000.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.364
- [Gordon] This place is baffling.

14:45.364 --> 14:47.098
I hope the food makes more sense.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.110
Excellent, wow.

14:49.110 --> 14:50.647
- There you go.

14:50.647 --> 14:53.309
- Where are the crab cakes?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.072
Oh, that's them there, underneath there.

14:55.072 --> 14:57.251
Are they mini crab cakes, are we?

14:57.251 --> 14:59.514
- The chef has decided
that those are the size

14:59.514 --> 15:00.713
that he needs to serve.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.581
- Ugh, I mean that tastes dreadful.

15:04.581 --> 15:09.795
That thing tastes sort of washy
and soapy, and $20 for that?

15:09.962 --> 15:13.986
He's as cheap with his crab
cakes as he is with his staff.

15:13.986 --> 15:17.639
Now for the lamb, with Robert's
ridiculous $15 extra charge.

15:18.606 --> 15:22.829
- It's a rack of lamb
encrusted in macadamia nuts,

15:22.829 --> 15:26.322
fresh herbs and a little
bit of Dijon mustard.

15:26.322 --> 15:29.512
It's served with a
honey vinegar reduction.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.785
- It's not even cooked
properly and rested.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.225
I'm gonna take that off.

15:34.225 --> 15:37.669
I always get nervous when
you see white fat like that

15:37.669 --> 15:39.963
on the side of a chop.

15:39.963 --> 15:42.890
(lively suspenseful music)

15:42.890 --> 15:44.239
- Is it to your liking?

15:46.529 --> 15:47.937
- It's pretty raw in the centre.

15:47.937 --> 15:50.557
- [Barbara] You like the flavour
of it, though, the honeygar?

15:52.640 --> 15:53.790
- No, way too sweet.

15:57.603 --> 16:00.418
- I'm not satisfied with
the quality of the foods

16:00.418 --> 16:01.670
coming out of the kitchen.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.901
I believe our chef has a learning curve

16:03.901 --> 16:05.571
to be where he needs to be.

16:05.571 --> 16:06.614
- Thank you.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.980
- We just lost our other chef.

16:09.980 --> 16:11.283
- Why did the chef leave?

16:12.277 --> 16:13.765
- I'm supposed to tell
you the truth, right?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.579
- Truth is all I want to know.

16:15.579 --> 16:16.716
Why did the chef leave?

16:16.716 --> 16:18.398
- Well, her paycheck.

16:19.656 --> 16:22.675
She put everything on her charge cards

16:22.675 --> 16:26.111
and she just figured she
wasn't paid back for what she-

16:26.111 --> 16:28.509
- The chef bought produce
on her credit card?

16:28.509 --> 16:29.875
- She did everything.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.336
She was the best chef ever.

16:32.336 --> 16:33.632
- Barbara, that's dreadful.

16:34.603 --> 16:37.685
I'm starving, the peanut
butter chocolate decadence,

16:37.685 --> 16:38.553
I could do with some of that.

16:38.553 --> 16:41.094
Pick me up, please, thank you.

16:41.094 --> 16:43.993
God, a chef that left because
she had to buy produce

16:43.993 --> 16:45.296
on her own credit card, I mean,

16:45.296 --> 16:47.278
this guy's priorities are upside down.

16:48.262 --> 16:49.305
A bit like this inn.

16:50.564 --> 16:52.210
- Okay, are you ready?

16:52.210 --> 16:55.510
This, he said, he doesn't
care for the sweetness,

16:55.510 --> 16:57.371
there's fat around it.

16:57.371 --> 17:00.799
He didn't care for the
flavour of the honeygar.

17:00.799 --> 17:03.667
(dramatic music)

17:04.935 --> 17:08.424
(suspenseful music)

17:08.424 --> 17:10.407
- Wow, thank you very much.

17:10.407 --> 17:11.277
Did you cut it in half?

17:11.277 --> 17:12.278
'Cause it looks like someone's taken it.

17:12.278 --> 17:13.146
- [Barbara] I did.

17:13.146 --> 17:14.461
- [Gordon] And where's
the other half gone?

17:14.461 --> 17:16.338
- [Barbara] It goes to
another person who orders it.

17:16.338 --> 17:18.577
- Oh no, I want my other half.

17:18.577 --> 17:23.067
$74, this place is insane.

17:24.690 --> 17:26.598
Listen, half my dessert's missing.

17:26.598 --> 17:30.978
If you think I'm spending
$74 for a dessert

17:30.978 --> 17:33.014
that is half-cocked.

17:37.943 --> 17:40.101
It's actually quite nice, there is hope.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.354
- I'm sorry, I'm going to say that that

17:42.354 --> 17:44.126
is not a dessert that he made.

17:44.126 --> 17:45.033
- [Gordon] Barbara made it.

17:45.033 --> 17:45.902
- Nope.

17:45.902 --> 17:46.770
- Somebody else makes desserts?

17:46.770 --> 17:47.639
- It's ordered.

17:47.639 --> 17:48.985
- Like store-bought?

17:48.985 --> 17:50.455
- Like through one of our purveyors.

17:50.455 --> 17:53.344
- What? Where's the chef?

17:53.344 --> 17:54.657
- He's in the kitchen.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.615
- Can we get him out, please?

17:56.615 --> 17:57.483
What?

17:59.726 --> 18:00.595
- How're you doing, chef?

18:00.595 --> 18:01.873
- Giulian, in my opinion,

18:01.873 --> 18:04.261
is not living up to his
potential as a chef.

18:04.261 --> 18:05.929
He will try to cut corners,

18:05.929 --> 18:08.557
and I think Gordon needs
to know these things.

18:08.557 --> 18:11.205
- I've just spent $74 for three plates

18:11.205 --> 18:14.608
of absolute dire, dated, shit food.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.504
Crab cakes.
- Yes, sir?

18:18.504 --> 18:20.777
- You can't put two
little half testicle-sized

18:20.777 --> 18:23.436
fucking crab cakes that came from a can.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.400
There's bigger fucking cakes, chef,

18:25.400 --> 18:27.388
at a fucking canape party.

18:27.388 --> 18:30.183
My lamb was cold in the
middle, the fat was white.

18:30.183 --> 18:31.778
It was more like a mouthful of sugar.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.697
The best tasting dish for me

18:33.697 --> 18:36.171
was the fucking chocolate peanut thing

18:36.171 --> 18:38.326
that I got served half a portion,

18:38.326 --> 18:41.788
that's not even made fucking in-house.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.551
(suspenseful music)

18:44.551 --> 18:45.573
What is this?

18:45.573 --> 18:47.022
There's no synergy here.

18:47.022 --> 18:49.702
- There is honestly a lack
of communication, often.

18:49.702 --> 18:51.725
Sometimes when I'm in the middle
of doing breakfast service

18:51.725 --> 18:53.591
for the ten people that we randomly get,

18:53.591 --> 18:56.042
I get five texts from
him asking me a question.

18:56.928 --> 18:58.669
- [Gordon] So why are you texting him?

18:58.669 --> 18:59.806
- If you have a question,

18:59.806 --> 19:01.561
you should maybe leave the RV
and come out and talk to us.

19:01.561 --> 19:02.715
- [Robert] Show me those texts.

19:02.715 --> 19:03.820
- Are you nit picking?

19:03.820 --> 19:04.708
Are you trying to control him?

19:04.708 --> 19:05.576
Are you?

19:05.576 --> 19:06.580
- No, I'm trying to make sure,

19:07.553 --> 19:09.806
I haven't been sleeping very
well, to be honest with you,

19:09.806 --> 19:11.925
and I've been beaten down.

19:13.090 --> 19:14.498
- I'll take responsibility for everything

19:14.498 --> 19:15.478
that happens in the kitchen.

19:15.478 --> 19:16.760
- You don't own the place.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.266
You own it, yet he's
acting more responsible.

19:20.181 --> 19:21.870
What do you earn a week, if
you don't mind me asking?

19:21.870 --> 19:23.006
$1,000?

19:23.006 --> 19:24.782
- Before taxes, 400.

19:26.124 --> 19:29.721
- Jesus Christ Almighty, $400 a week,

19:29.721 --> 19:31.661
to be the head chef in a luxury hotel?

19:31.661 --> 19:32.849
That's insane.

19:32.849 --> 19:34.761
I mean, you're barely surviving.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.583
- I don't know that I'm
even barely surviving.

19:37.583 --> 19:39.804
- If you're not happy with
your work environment,

19:39.804 --> 19:40.983
you should leave.

19:40.983 --> 19:44.145
- Are you taking the piss, or
is this just an abuse for you?

19:44.145 --> 19:45.970
What are you doing to these people?

19:47.070 --> 19:50.532
This is their livelihoods,
this is your responsibility.

19:50.532 --> 19:52.119
(suspenseful music)

19:52.119 --> 19:56.376
Rob's world and you're in
an RV at a hundred grand.

19:57.728 --> 20:00.273
- Everybody is disgusted
that you live in that thing,

20:00.273 --> 20:03.192
they really are, because
it costs so much money

20:03.192 --> 20:05.382
and they can't get their paycheck on time.

20:06.810 --> 20:08.785
- Well, that is not the,
that is not the case.

20:08.785 --> 20:10.074
- That is part of the issue.

20:10.074 --> 20:12.326
We are surrounded by wealth
and reminded of poverty

20:12.326 --> 20:14.454
at the same time because of that RV.

20:14.454 --> 20:15.322
It's a symbol.

20:15.322 --> 20:18.374
To me, that RV is a
symbol, and it's a symbol

20:18.374 --> 20:20.533
that you're separating
yourself from everybody else.

20:20.533 --> 20:23.400
- I'd be very careful about
coming down on me too hard.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.383
- I'm telling you exactly how I feel

20:27.383 --> 20:29.489
and how the people that I work with feel.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.897
- Let me tell you how I feel.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.170
When you're in your fucking
kitchen all day long,

20:33.170 --> 20:34.724
and you're an the goddamn internet

20:34.724 --> 20:37.247
instead of actually trying to
perfect a menu and get a menu.

20:37.247 --> 20:40.334
How long did I ask for you
to make a menu of your own?

20:40.334 --> 20:41.658
- And if I'm on the computer, usually it's

20:41.658 --> 20:44.932
'cause I'm trying to research
menus, research ingredients.

20:44.932 --> 20:45.860
- Give me a break.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.278
- I've given you plenty of breaks.

20:47.278 --> 20:48.967
I work very long days

20:48.967 --> 20:50.709
and I haven't been paid in three weeks.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.721
There's only been one
paycheck that I got on time.

20:52.721 --> 20:54.692
Almost the entire staff
is ready to walk out

20:54.692 --> 20:57.079
because they are tired
of not getting paid.

20:57.079 --> 20:58.755
- Anything to say?

20:58.755 --> 21:01.271
(dramatic music)

21:01.271 --> 21:02.679
No.
- We do things.

21:02.679 --> 21:03.826
- [Gordon] Oh, please.

21:13.033 --> 21:15.348
It's my first day at
Vermont's Juniper Hill Inn,

21:15.348 --> 21:17.548
and the battle between
the chef and the owner.

21:17.548 --> 21:20.061
- I'd be very careful about
coming down on me too hard.

21:20.061 --> 21:20.929
- [Gordon] Has turned what should be

21:20.929 --> 21:24.294
a charming country inn into a war zone.

21:24.294 --> 21:26.213
- I'm telling you exactly how I feel.

21:26.213 --> 21:27.933
I work very long days

21:27.933 --> 21:29.664
and I haven't been paid in three weeks.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.666
There's only been one
paycheck that I got on time.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.637
Almost the entire staff
is ready to walk out

21:33.637 --> 21:36.035
because they are tired
of not getting paid.

21:36.035 --> 21:36.974
- Anything to say?

21:39.080 --> 21:39.948
No.

21:41.078 --> 21:43.605
- We're tired and half the team's broke.

21:43.605 --> 21:46.105
I'm beyond angry, I'm beyond pissed off.

21:48.166 --> 21:49.959
(melancholic music)

21:49.959 --> 21:53.094
- Well, I just got a new
asshole ripped to me.

21:53.094 --> 21:55.242
Gordon says that I live
in a fantasy world,

21:55.242 --> 21:59.194
and that I live in a million dollar RV

21:59.194 --> 22:02.332
while our employees can't pay their bills

22:02.332 --> 22:03.959
and all of this kind of stuff,

22:03.959 --> 22:05.554
'cause we don't pay them on time.

22:05.554 --> 22:06.774
And they're all complaining

22:06.774 --> 22:09.402
that they haven't gotten their
paychecks this time either.

22:09.402 --> 22:10.921
- [Ari] Well, they haven't.

22:10.921 --> 22:13.788
- [Robert] And he said that
everything is all about me.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.201
- I can't believe what
a mess this place is.

22:17.201 --> 22:19.537
I've got to get off this hill for a bit.

22:19.537 --> 22:21.101
There's someone I need to see.

22:22.311 --> 22:24.386
Hello, is that Lida?

22:24.386 --> 22:25.595
It's Gordon Ramsay.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.701
I've got some questions about
Robert and Juniper Hill,

22:27.701 --> 22:30.228
would you mind if I pop over
for five minutes, please?

22:31.466 --> 22:33.650
Great, I'll see you then.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.199
Thanks, Lida.

22:35.199 --> 22:38.067
(dramatic music)

22:39.862 --> 22:42.164
I think the old chef
that quit would be able

22:42.164 --> 22:45.292
to give me some insight into
what's wrong with Juniper Hill.

22:49.342 --> 22:51.350
(hand knocking)

22:51.350 --> 22:53.164
- [Lida] Hello, how are you?
- Lida, how are you?

22:53.164 --> 22:54.603
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

22:54.603 --> 22:55.472
Come on in.

22:56.616 --> 22:57.484
- Give me a little insight

22:57.484 --> 22:59.786
to what it was like
actually working there.

22:59.786 --> 23:02.570
- I have to say it was a
very interesting five years.

23:02.570 --> 23:04.426
Things were going very,
very, well and then,

23:04.426 --> 23:07.418
all of a sudden, two years into it,

23:07.418 --> 23:08.982
they stop answering the phone.

23:11.161 --> 23:13.330
Robert, I think, thought
he was too important

23:13.330 --> 23:16.094
to answer the phone or he was
too busy doing other things.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.626
- So preoccupied and distracted.

23:17.626 --> 23:19.441
- Very, very preoccupied and distracted,

23:19.441 --> 23:22.767
and not focused at all on
maintaining his own business.

23:22.767 --> 23:23.635
- Wow.

23:23.635 --> 23:24.504
- I was getting cut out of a living

23:24.504 --> 23:25.676
when they did this all this stuff.

23:25.676 --> 23:28.429
I used to earn 40,
$50,000 in one restaurant

23:28.429 --> 23:30.517
and now I'm down to earning 15.

23:30.517 --> 23:31.789
- Were you paid on time?

23:32.839 --> 23:34.059
- Not very often.

23:34.059 --> 23:36.656
- Wow, did you ever use your
own money to buy things?

23:36.656 --> 23:38.063
- All the time.

23:38.063 --> 23:40.941
And then I would have to
demand to be paid back,

23:40.941 --> 23:42.987
or we weren't gonna open for dinner.

23:42.987 --> 23:43.856
- It's insane.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.446
- Barbara has been shorted checks a lot.

23:45.446 --> 23:47.198
- She's barely earning $100 a week.

23:47.198 --> 23:48.970
- Yeah, and he won't pay her.

23:48.970 --> 23:51.504
And then if he had a private
party with all his friends,

23:51.504 --> 23:53.120
he didn't tip them.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.007
- You're kidding me?
- No.

23:55.007 --> 23:56.008
- That is just disgusting.

23:56.008 --> 23:58.509
I mean, that's where I draw
the, you can't do that.

23:58.509 --> 23:59.377
- No.

23:59.377 --> 24:01.587
- You just can't treat people like that.

24:01.587 --> 24:04.486
He's a confirmed snob, and he
thinks he's above the town.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.074
He thinks he's untouchable.

24:06.957 --> 24:08.821
I'm here to make this place work,

24:08.821 --> 24:10.950
and the first thing I'm
gonna do is burst his bubble.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.839
- I'd like to be a fly on
that wall, but. (laughs)

24:13.839 --> 24:16.174
- Would you come back and
walk through the doors

24:16.174 --> 24:17.415
to have a look at it
at the end of the week

24:17.415 --> 24:19.959
and just come back for dinner?

24:19.959 --> 24:22.055
- No.
- No, just won't go, or?

24:22.055 --> 24:24.141
- No, I'm not even
interested in getting in,

24:24.141 --> 24:26.508
I just fear getting in one more battle

24:26.508 --> 24:27.853
with Ari or Robert, and-

24:27.853 --> 24:29.417
- What a shame, after five years.

24:29.417 --> 24:30.313
- Yeah.

24:30.313 --> 24:32.386
- Do you think I've got
a chance of saving it?

24:32.386 --> 24:34.672
- The problem he has now
is nobody will work there.

24:34.672 --> 24:37.477
- You know, I'm there to get
this place turned around.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.469
Those staff deserve a better future.

24:39.469 --> 24:42.200
- They do, you know, I
feel terrible for them.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.069
- Listen, thank you.

24:43.069 --> 24:44.307
- You're very welcome.

24:44.307 --> 24:45.175
- Appreciate your time.

24:45.175 --> 24:46.653
- Enjoyed it.
- Thanks, Lida, likewise.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.521
- Nice to meet you.
- Good to see you, too.

24:47.521 --> 24:48.627
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.867
(dramatic music)

24:52.867 --> 24:54.817
- How sad is that, after
five years of her life

24:54.817 --> 24:58.133
dedicated to the Juniper Hill, you know,

24:58.133 --> 25:01.219
she won't even step foot in the door.

25:01.219 --> 25:02.877
She doesn't wanna even see them.

25:06.715 --> 25:08.894
The old chef left because
she couldn't stand it.

25:08.894 --> 25:11.448
And the current chef looks
like he's ready to walk, too.

25:11.448 --> 25:14.472
I wonder if everyone here is
feeling the same frustration?

25:15.520 --> 25:16.498
What's wrong with the place?

25:16.498 --> 25:17.726
- What's wrong with the place?

25:17.726 --> 25:20.322
We're lacking paychecks on time.

25:20.322 --> 25:22.491
- [Gordon] Paycheck, you
don't get paid on time either?

25:22.491 --> 25:23.533
- No.

25:23.533 --> 25:25.171
- We're missing basic supplies, too.

25:25.171 --> 25:26.039
- Basic supplies?

25:26.039 --> 25:26.954
- We don't even have, I mean,

25:26.954 --> 25:29.894
Noelle purchased guest
checks for us today.

25:29.894 --> 25:32.419
We've been using scrap pieces of paper.

25:32.419 --> 25:34.294
(dramatic music)

25:34.294 --> 25:35.163
- First name is?

25:35.163 --> 25:36.031
- I'm Ryan Keith.

25:36.031 --> 25:37.537
- Ryan Keith, and what you do?

25:37.537 --> 25:38.601
- I'm the estate manager here,

25:38.601 --> 25:39.998
I do all the maintenance on the house.

25:39.998 --> 25:40.978
I've done everything here, though.

25:40.978 --> 25:43.105
That's why he likes me
to spread out my talents

25:43.105 --> 25:45.879
to try and help anybody
wherever they need help.

25:45.879 --> 25:46.747
- How's morale?

25:48.037 --> 25:50.362
- Not good. (chuckles)

25:50.362 --> 25:52.886
I personally haven't been
paid since the 6th of January,

25:52.886 --> 25:55.148
here it is the 1st of February.

25:55.148 --> 25:56.838
- That's nearly a month.

25:56.838 --> 25:59.674
- You pay the employees
before paying your bills

25:59.674 --> 26:01.999
when they've done the work,
that's their livelihood.

26:01.999 --> 26:04.230
- I'm amazed you're still here,
working as hard as you are,

26:04.230 --> 26:07.108
because staff never needs
to be treated like this,

26:07.108 --> 26:08.724
let me tell you.

26:08.724 --> 26:10.257
- It's almost as if what
you're saying to him

26:10.257 --> 26:14.074
doesn't get through, because
he sees you as not an equal.

26:14.074 --> 26:15.568
He treats me like that,
and that really bothers me,

26:15.568 --> 26:18.025
because I feel like
I've contributed a lot.

26:18.025 --> 26:19.412
It's actually pretty degrading.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.122
- This is insane.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.631
Coming up, oh my God.

26:23.812 --> 26:27.170
I uncover the shocking extent
of Robert's reckless spending.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.400
Thousands of dollars worth.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.361
- Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

26:30.361 --> 26:32.175
- [Gordon] Robert's dreadful
communication skills

26:32.175 --> 26:33.044
cause a meltdown.

26:33.044 --> 26:34.344
- I said where does this chicken?

26:34.344 --> 26:35.387
- So ask him again.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.283
Tempers flare.

26:36.283 --> 26:37.938
- Excuse me, I am the boss.

26:37.938 --> 26:39.992
- And Robert reveals his true colours.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.297
How dare you?

26:41.297 --> 26:44.164
(dramatic music)

26:45.895 --> 26:48.306
(lilting music)

26:48.306 --> 26:51.048
I'm shocked with what I'm
finding at the Juniper Hill Inn.

26:51.048 --> 26:52.664
Owner Robert wants to kill his chef.

26:52.664 --> 26:55.876
- How long did I ask for you
to make a menu of your own?

26:55.876 --> 26:58.128
- And the rest of the
staff want to kill Robert.

26:58.128 --> 26:59.233
How's morale?

26:59.233 --> 27:00.102
- Not good.

27:00.102 --> 27:01.684
- [Gordon] Estate
manager, Ryan, has told me

27:01.684 --> 27:03.227
about some of the problems.

27:03.227 --> 27:05.500
But now he wants to show me.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.730
- If you wanna see the
root of the problem,

27:06.730 --> 27:07.836
let's go to the basement.

27:07.836 --> 27:08.704
- [Gordon] To the basement.

27:08.704 --> 27:09.911
- [Ryan] Yes, please.

27:09.911 --> 27:11.735
- [Gordon] Jesus, what's in there?

27:11.735 --> 27:13.685
- Everything.
- Oh, really?

27:13.685 --> 27:15.593
- The majority of it is personal items.

27:15.593 --> 27:18.377
- Look, even the shelves are all lined.

27:18.377 --> 27:21.300
Bloody hell, look at this place.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.323
Oh my God.

27:24.323 --> 27:27.282
(dramatic music)

27:27.282 --> 27:29.003
Look at this stuff.

27:29.003 --> 27:33.121
Stereos, wine racks, quilts, chairs,

27:33.121 --> 27:36.698
tables, copper pans,
more chairs over there.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.584
Look at these.

27:37.584 --> 27:39.232
- [Ryan] Robert prides
himself in having to have

27:39.232 --> 27:40.744
the very best of everything.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.912
- Christ, there's enough in
here to open three restaurants.

27:42.912 --> 27:44.841
Is all this stuff still brand new?

27:44.841 --> 27:45.926
- [Ryan] Most of it is brand new.

27:45.926 --> 27:48.637
- [Gordon] It's littered
with thousands of dollars.

27:48.637 --> 27:51.796
Robert's got so much stuff he
could furnish a dozen houses.

27:51.796 --> 27:54.208
But he doesn't pay his staff, it's crazy.

27:55.123 --> 27:55.991
Where are we going?

27:55.991 --> 27:58.772
- [Ryan] Brace yourself,
we're going up to the office.

27:58.772 --> 28:00.315
- [Gordon] You're kidding me.

28:00.315 --> 28:02.453
Oh no, come on.
- Please, come in.

28:02.453 --> 28:03.568
- [Gordon] This is the office?

28:03.568 --> 28:04.486
- [Ryan] This is the office.

28:04.486 --> 28:05.355
- [Gordon] You are kidding me.

28:05.355 --> 28:06.223
- [Ryan] Not at all.

28:06.223 --> 28:07.092
I wanted you to see.

28:07.092 --> 28:09.533
- Jesus Christ.
- Scares me half to death.

28:09.533 --> 28:12.546
- Oh my gosh, this is insane.

28:12.546 --> 28:13.683
It would only take a day or two

28:13.683 --> 28:15.153
to sort out this hoarder's heaven,

28:15.153 --> 28:16.738
but Robert's left it in chaos.

28:16.738 --> 28:19.939
No wonder he spends all
day hiding in his RV.

28:19.939 --> 28:22.077
This guy has lost the plot.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.141
- [Ryan] This is disturbing.

28:24.141 --> 28:25.955
- [Gordon] Please tell me there's no more.

28:25.955 --> 28:27.155
- Yes, there's more.

28:27.155 --> 28:28.823
This is where the pigs are kept.

28:29.980 --> 28:32.504
- At least they look happy, hey.

28:32.504 --> 28:34.464
Pigs, who live a life of luxury

28:34.464 --> 28:36.299
while everyone around them suffers,

28:36.299 --> 28:37.821
sounds strangely familiar.

28:37.821 --> 28:38.843
Bloody hell.

28:39.803 --> 28:42.768
So the owners live out, the pigs live in.

28:42.768 --> 28:43.811
(pig grunts)

28:43.811 --> 28:44.943
- [Ryan] There's more.

28:44.943 --> 28:46.320
We'll check out the storage units.

28:46.320 --> 28:47.706
- [Gordon] Storage units?

28:47.706 --> 28:48.822
You are kidding me.

28:48.822 --> 28:49.761
- No.

28:49.761 --> 28:50.855
- [Gordon] Oh my God.

28:52.659 --> 28:54.286
- [Ryan] This one's all personal items.

28:54.286 --> 28:56.257
- Oh, Jesus.

28:56.257 --> 28:57.456
I mean, I swear to God.

28:57.456 --> 29:00.240
It's like a special edition of "Hoarders."

29:00.240 --> 29:02.610
I mean, honestly, wow.

29:04.661 --> 29:06.955
I'm in shock, you know that?

29:06.955 --> 29:08.456
And this one?

29:08.456 --> 29:11.744
- All of this entire storage
unit is full of chairs.

29:13.707 --> 29:15.435
- Oh my God.

29:16.318 --> 29:18.873
Look at this stuff, honestly.

29:18.873 --> 29:20.249
I mean, they must be packed

29:20.249 --> 29:22.606
with thousands of dollars worth of-

29:22.606 --> 29:24.827
- Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

29:24.827 --> 29:26.824
- How much stuff does one need?

29:26.824 --> 29:29.321
(metal clanking)

29:29.321 --> 29:30.189
Bloody hell.

29:31.876 --> 29:34.159
I can't believe how much
stuff Robert has bought.

29:34.159 --> 29:35.880
He must have spent a fortune.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.767
I've got to meet Robert's partner Ari,

29:37.767 --> 29:40.262
and find out why he's financing all this.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.825
- Welcome, welcome, my name's Ari.

29:43.825 --> 29:45.778
- It's a pleasure, please.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.518
My God, so, how much money

29:49.518 --> 29:51.270
have you put into this
business personally?

29:51.270 --> 29:52.952
- More or less over a million dollars.

29:52.952 --> 29:53.820
- A million dollars.

29:53.820 --> 29:54.940
And how much have you seen back?

29:54.940 --> 29:55.809
- Nothing.

29:56.921 --> 30:00.154
It was all my severance
packages, my income

30:00.154 --> 30:03.105
that I had when I was working,
and then my retirement plans.

30:03.105 --> 30:06.421
Robert's savings are in
artwork and antiques.

30:06.421 --> 30:10.570
I am supporting this inn with my savings.

30:10.570 --> 30:12.500
- [Gordon] Clearly this
is a beautiful place,

30:12.500 --> 30:13.980
but putting your entire life savings

30:13.980 --> 30:15.940
into a sinking ship is insane.

30:15.940 --> 30:16.983
And with Robert at the helm,

30:16.983 --> 30:18.620
treating his staff so poorly,

30:18.620 --> 30:20.601
I don't see things getting any better.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.939
Robert is in a fantasy world

30:24.939 --> 30:28.526
and I've been struggling all
day to get through to him.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.113
This place, it's dreamland, a playground

30:32.113 --> 30:33.576
for your boyfriend, Robert.

30:34.668 --> 30:37.660
Your biggest problem is not Juniper Hill.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.103
Your biggest problem is fucking Robert.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.015
(thunder crashing)

30:56.022 --> 30:57.795
I'm at Vermont's Juniper Hill Inn,

30:57.795 --> 30:59.359
and I've just had a difficult conversation

30:59.359 --> 31:02.226
with Robert's partner, Ari,
who seems strangely unconcerned

31:02.226 --> 31:03.853
about how bad things really are here.

31:03.853 --> 31:06.084
How much money have you put
into this business personally?

31:06.084 --> 31:08.111
- More or less over a million dollars.

31:08.111 --> 31:08.980
- A million dollars.

31:08.980 --> 31:10.422
And how much have you seen back?

31:10.422 --> 31:11.291
- Nothing.

31:12.518 --> 31:13.623
- But I've tried to make him see

31:13.623 --> 31:15.396
who's to blame for the problems.

31:15.396 --> 31:17.849
Your biggest problem is fucking Robert.

31:21.715 --> 31:23.133
Dinner time is approaching.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.884
Word has spread about me being at the inn,

31:24.884 --> 31:26.104
and the place is bustling.

31:26.104 --> 31:27.741
- [Robert] Good to see you, hello there.

31:27.741 --> 31:28.610
- Robert, hey.

31:28.610 --> 31:29.806
- [Robert] Nice to see.

31:29.806 --> 31:30.734
- [Gordon] I'm learning a lot

31:30.734 --> 31:32.277
about why the inn is struggling,

31:32.277 --> 31:33.716
by watching Robert and Ari deal

31:33.716 --> 31:35.770
with the new influx of guests.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.418
Anyone with any restaurant experience

31:37.418 --> 31:39.109
would stagger the seating of guests,

31:39.109 --> 31:40.817
but as if they're just welcoming people

31:40.817 --> 31:42.590
to a dinner party at a private house.

31:42.590 --> 31:44.112
- [Robert] Hello there, how are you?

31:44.112 --> 31:45.968
- [Gordon] Robert and Ari
seat everyone at once.

31:45.968 --> 31:47.125
- There in the corner.

31:47.125 --> 31:48.835
- Make pretend you're back in 1902.

31:48.835 --> 31:50.714
It's meant to be a relaxed evening.

31:50.714 --> 31:51.602
- Order in.

31:51.602 --> 31:52.944
- [Gordon] And that's
a recipe for disaster

31:52.944 --> 31:55.467
for chef Giulian and the wait staff.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.490
- Chef, I'm making a change on 21.

31:57.490 --> 31:59.359
- Write it down, don't tell
me, just write it down.

31:59.359 --> 32:00.427
- [Barbara] Here's an order.

32:00.427 --> 32:02.641
- [Giulian] Are you guys kidding
me with all these orders?

32:02.641 --> 32:04.496
Who sat everybody at once like this?

32:04.496 --> 32:05.364
- [Waitress] Your best friends.

32:05.364 --> 32:06.754
- We don't know about pacing?

32:06.754 --> 32:07.623
- [Waitress] Your best friends.

32:07.623 --> 32:10.659
I mentioned, they said
they can't, slam through.

32:10.659 --> 32:11.647
- Who's writing the tickets?

32:11.647 --> 32:13.214
Do you know what I mean,
table four, table five?

32:13.214 --> 32:15.570
- Some of them have names on
them, some of them do not.

32:15.570 --> 32:16.439
- Who wrote that ticket?

32:16.439 --> 32:17.510
There's not even a table number on there.

32:17.510 --> 32:19.679
- [Waitress] Table four,
she just got their lobster.

32:19.679 --> 32:21.128
- [Ryan] Where's table 23, they've got.

32:21.128 --> 32:22.598
- I need one person at a time.

32:22.598 --> 32:24.037
I need less talking in
the kitchen, please.

32:24.037 --> 32:25.664
- Table 23 has got no food.

32:25.664 --> 32:26.571
- Every time I try to put
things up in the window,

32:26.571 --> 32:28.146
eight people ask me for something.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.428
- [Gordon] With Giulian
having been slammed

32:29.428 --> 32:31.092
by the owners' dreadful seating,

32:31.092 --> 32:33.297
Ari isn't helping the strained atmosphere

32:33.297 --> 32:34.391
with an awkward art lesson.

32:34.391 --> 32:37.029
- But then, like this, this is from 1800

32:37.029 --> 32:39.386
and it was painted for a opera house,

32:39.386 --> 32:40.999
'cause you know what it is?

32:40.999 --> 32:42.955
(jaunty music)

32:42.955 --> 32:43.824
- [Guest] What is it?

32:43.824 --> 32:45.819
- Come on, everybody has
to know what that is?

32:45.819 --> 32:48.228
It's Hannibal going across the alps

32:48.228 --> 32:49.792
with the white elephants.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.200
Everybody should know that.

32:55.694 --> 32:56.862
- [Gordon] On the other side of the house,

32:56.862 --> 32:59.625
Robert's also busy giving a lecture.

32:59.625 --> 33:01.450
- This is one of the
original signs to the house.

33:01.450 --> 33:03.639
There's a lot of history here.

33:03.639 --> 33:06.559
Teddy Roosevelt actually was
best friends with the man,

33:06.559 --> 33:07.967
or a very good friend with the man

33:07.967 --> 33:10.313
who actually built the
house, Maxwell Evarts.

33:11.512 --> 33:13.222
- Do you always get
this backed up, I mean?

33:13.222 --> 33:14.233
- Yes.
- Yeah?

33:14.233 --> 33:18.227
- When I have poor seating.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.915
Robert has groups of his friends come in,

33:19.915 --> 33:21.199
and seating them at once.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.971
- Okay, so you're waiting
for your starters now?

33:22.971 --> 33:23.840
- Yes.
- Okay.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.193
Well, let me check on those
for you and see how it's going.

33:26.193 --> 33:27.549
- [Guest] Okay, thank you.

33:29.373 --> 33:32.327
- Robert, this ticket system
is bollocks, you know that?

33:34.212 --> 33:36.182
Handwritten tickets, no time on there,

33:36.182 --> 33:38.208
no proper dates, no coordination.

33:39.237 --> 33:40.614
Who trains the front of house team?

33:40.614 --> 33:42.804
Who's in charge of the
restaurant, who is that?

33:42.804 --> 33:44.576
- I would be the host, and then-

33:44.576 --> 33:45.445
- You'll be the host.

33:45.445 --> 33:47.318
- Yes, the chef takes over the kitchen.

33:47.318 --> 33:48.872
- This place is such a mess.

33:48.872 --> 33:51.886
Clearly, Robert has no
idea how to run a hotel.

33:51.886 --> 33:53.481
Yeah, hi, I've had better days.

33:53.481 --> 33:54.349
- Me too.

33:54.349 --> 33:55.218
- Yeah, go on, what's the matter?

33:55.218 --> 33:56.400
- I'm trying to straighten
out the damn drinks,

33:56.400 --> 33:59.303
'cause they lost 30 something drinks.

33:59.303 --> 34:03.022
- Oh my God, Robert, we lost 30 drinks.

34:03.022 --> 34:03.890
- At least.

34:03.890 --> 34:06.463
I often find drinks not written down or,

34:06.463 --> 34:08.297
just a lack of follow-through,

34:08.297 --> 34:11.395
and it's a big problem when
we're trying to make money.

34:11.395 --> 34:12.830
- There's no communication between the bar

34:12.830 --> 34:15.503
and the dining room, so
people get served drinks,

34:15.503 --> 34:16.563
but no one remembers to charge for them.

34:16.563 --> 34:18.089
But we're losing big money there.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.996
- No kidding, and they're
losing their checks

34:19.996 --> 34:21.989
and I'm going crazy trying
to figure out a system.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.313
- They have hardly any guests

34:23.313 --> 34:24.898
and don't charge the ones they do have,

34:24.898 --> 34:26.368
no wonder this place is in the red.

34:26.368 --> 34:27.237
How does that happen?

34:27.237 --> 34:28.902
- They're supposed to
write the drinks down,

34:28.902 --> 34:31.143
and then apply them to a table and a room,

34:31.143 --> 34:33.726
and then they go into the computer.

34:33.726 --> 34:35.554
- The ticket system is bogus.

34:35.554 --> 34:37.534
And as I feared, seating everyone at once

34:37.534 --> 34:40.507
is already causing problems
for the staff and the guests.

34:41.911 --> 34:43.114
- It's not very warm.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.243
- It's burnt.

34:45.158 --> 34:46.357
- [Gordon] With guests now suffering,

34:46.357 --> 34:47.483
and the kitchen falling apart

34:47.483 --> 34:51.529
from Robert's ill-managed
seating, I have to step in.

34:51.529 --> 34:52.804
Just stop there.

34:55.324 --> 34:57.972
You have to be fucking kidding me.

34:57.972 --> 35:01.299
This goose liver is
burnt to a cinder, stop.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.957
Giulian, come round, buddy.

35:02.957 --> 35:04.615
I know we're in the shit and we're busy.

35:04.615 --> 35:06.077
Food's dying in the window.

35:07.127 --> 35:12.080
A foie gras salad, I mean, honestly?

35:12.080 --> 35:14.753
It's like a piece of fucking beef jerky.

35:16.105 --> 35:17.221
Where's Ari?

35:17.221 --> 35:19.442
Get me Ari, urgently.

35:19.442 --> 35:22.038
I mean honestly, come on, guys.

35:22.038 --> 35:22.907
- [Ari] Hello.

35:22.907 --> 35:24.071
- [Gordon] I stopped that.

35:24.071 --> 35:25.198
I've just had enough.

35:25.198 --> 35:26.402
- [Ari] What is that?
- [Gordon] What is that?

35:26.402 --> 35:27.471
- [Giulian] Foie gras.

35:27.471 --> 35:28.628
- That's foie gras?

35:28.628 --> 35:29.497
That is not foie gras.

35:29.497 --> 35:31.099
- This is not funny, guys.

35:31.099 --> 35:31.986
- No, that is not funny.

35:31.986 --> 35:32.903
- I mean, I know we're in the shit,

35:32.903 --> 35:35.343
but does anyone have any standards here?

35:35.343 --> 35:36.511
- Yes.

35:36.511 --> 35:38.555
- Well, can I see them?

35:38.555 --> 35:40.755
Can I see something to hold onto?

35:40.755 --> 35:43.841
'Cause right now I just
wanna get out of here.

35:43.841 --> 35:47.313
- I can only as good as I am
with the tools that I have.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.753
I'm embarrassed and I
know that I can do better,

35:49.753 --> 35:51.203
I know the staff can do better.

35:51.203 --> 35:53.945
- First off, no more fucking
tickets in the kitchen.

35:53.945 --> 35:55.822
Give him 10 minutes to catch up, okay?

35:55.822 --> 35:56.691
- [Waitress] All right.

35:56.691 --> 35:59.096
- And Robert, is it
possible for the first time

35:59.096 --> 36:01.046
put the phone away, get your jacket off

36:01.046 --> 36:03.788
and fucking dig deep a
little bit, yeah, please?

36:03.788 --> 36:05.477
Yeah, somebody?

36:05.477 --> 36:07.542
I'm concerned that food is in the window

36:07.542 --> 36:09.023
and it's just dying.

36:09.023 --> 36:11.525
- Entrees on table six, are in the window.

36:11.525 --> 36:14.007
- Entrees, send them, they
shouldn't be sat here, I mean.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.249
- How am I supposed to
do everything back here?

36:16.249 --> 36:17.156
- Are you with me?

36:17.156 --> 36:18.024
- I'm with you.

36:18.024 --> 36:18.893
- Are you an owner?

36:18.893 --> 36:19.762
- I'm with you.

36:19.762 --> 36:20.630
- Are you an entrepreneur?

36:20.630 --> 36:21.499
- I keep trying to, you know.

36:21.499 --> 36:23.902
- You can talk to him,
he's your fucking chef.

36:23.902 --> 36:25.296
- Well, when I try to communicate he says,

36:25.296 --> 36:26.832
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no,

36:26.832 --> 36:27.701
I can't do it."

36:27.701 --> 36:28.569
- No, he doesn't.

36:28.569 --> 36:29.866
Fucking find your balls

36:29.866 --> 36:30.784
and tell him you need to talk to him.

36:30.784 --> 36:31.785
- I found my balls.

36:31.785 --> 36:33.151
Do I want him to walk out?

36:33.151 --> 36:35.028
- He's not gonna walk out
if you communicate with him.

36:35.028 --> 36:35.977
Talk to him then.

36:35.977 --> 36:37.426
- Well, I have been trying to.

36:37.426 --> 36:40.752
- So when he finishes it,
send the fucking food.

36:40.752 --> 36:42.723
- There's always a third dish not ready

36:42.723 --> 36:43.592
or a fourth dish not ready.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.038
- Well, it must be one
or two minutes behind,

36:45.038 --> 36:45.906
but unless you fucking ask,

36:45.906 --> 36:48.020
how are you supposed to fucking know?

36:48.020 --> 36:48.979
- I have been asking.

36:48.979 --> 36:50.460
I said, "Where is this chicken?"

36:50.460 --> 36:51.760
- So ask him again.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.628
(dramatic music)

36:55.653 --> 36:58.134
It's the middle of dinner
service at Juniper Hill Inn,

36:58.134 --> 37:01.450
and chef Giulian is drowning
under a flood of orders.

37:01.450 --> 37:04.015
- How am I supposed to
do everything back here?

37:04.015 --> 37:05.777
- Owner Robert has finally decided

37:05.777 --> 37:07.508
to get his hands dirty to try and help,

37:07.508 --> 37:10.410
but he's utterly incapable of
communicating with his chef.

37:10.410 --> 37:13.890
When he finishes it,
send the fucking food.

37:13.890 --> 37:16.601
- There's always a third dish
not ready or a fourth dish.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.144
- Well, it must be one
or two minutes behind,

37:18.144 --> 37:19.033
but unless you fucking ask,

37:19.033 --> 37:20.962
how are you supposed to fucking know?

37:21.939 --> 37:23.264
(dramatic music)

37:23.264 --> 37:24.796
- Where's the soup go, Giulian?

37:24.796 --> 37:27.215
- Table 23, I just told
you one minute ago.

37:27.215 --> 37:28.394
- I need foie gras, where is it?

37:28.394 --> 37:29.624
- I know, I have it right behind me.

37:29.624 --> 37:32.112
- All right, well you see, okay.

37:32.112 --> 37:32.981
- Giulian!
- Yes.

37:32.981 --> 37:34.308
- [Gordon] That's what
you call communication.

37:34.308 --> 37:35.970
- It's better communication.

37:35.970 --> 37:37.361
- That's what you call
communication, Robert.

37:37.361 --> 37:40.197
There's a difference between interrupting

37:40.197 --> 37:41.396
and no communication.

37:41.396 --> 37:43.763
And when you fucking put
those entrees up there,

37:43.763 --> 37:45.306
you make sure they go.

37:45.306 --> 37:47.069
You've got to start stepping up

37:47.069 --> 37:49.206
and fucking dictating a little bit,

37:49.206 --> 37:50.708
'cause this is just madness.

37:50.708 --> 37:51.576
- I agree.

37:53.992 --> 37:55.640
- Jesus Christ.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.611
- It was fuck ups from start to finish.

37:58.611 --> 38:02.376
And it was a cluster-fuck
and Gordon saw that.

38:02.376 --> 38:04.294
- Dreadful, with an owner and chef

38:04.294 --> 38:06.536
so incapable of communicating
with each other,

38:06.536 --> 38:08.601
it's no surprise the diners are unhappy.

38:08.601 --> 38:10.206
And they're not the only ones.

38:10.206 --> 38:12.219
While Robert and Ari are living the dream,

38:12.219 --> 38:15.034
their staff are living a nightmare.

38:15.034 --> 38:17.391
Hopefully, by gathering
everyone in one room.

38:17.391 --> 38:18.259
Okay.

38:18.259 --> 38:19.539
I can get to the root of the problem.

38:19.539 --> 38:23.855
I've never seen a hotel,
an inn, in such disarray.

38:23.855 --> 38:25.201
- There needs to be structure,

38:25.201 --> 38:27.630
and there isn't structure.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.914
It's just like a scramble.

38:29.914 --> 38:30.907
- It's a mess.

38:32.114 --> 38:34.105
- There was no order in the kitchen.

38:34.105 --> 38:37.004
Nobody took responsibility
for any one thing.

38:37.004 --> 38:41.477
- No one has been taught any
standards in any department.

38:41.477 --> 38:43.761
- Really, it's like I'm
racing from thing to thing.

38:43.761 --> 38:46.680
Nobody knows what the other one's doing.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.317
- There's nobody here that is in control,

38:48.317 --> 38:49.537
willing to take charge.

38:49.537 --> 38:51.644
- I did 40 fucking
dinners by myself tonight.

38:51.644 --> 38:53.541
- I could help you and you've never asked.

38:53.541 --> 38:54.974
I can cook the rack of lamb.

38:54.974 --> 38:55.843
- Excuse me, excuse me.

38:55.843 --> 38:58.296
- Bragging about one plate
is nothing to brag about.

38:58.296 --> 38:59.165
- Excuse me.

38:59.165 --> 39:00.267
- Excuse me.

39:00.267 --> 39:01.581
- I am the boss.

39:01.581 --> 39:02.905
- You can't call yourself the boss

39:02.905 --> 39:04.712
if you don't fucking pay them.

39:07.159 --> 39:09.672
I mean, honestly, do you
think that's normal, Ari?

39:09.672 --> 39:11.778
Do you think that's the way
to look after your team?

39:11.778 --> 39:14.677
- Every pay period, there is
a problem with the checks.

39:14.677 --> 39:16.096
Every pay period, there's
a problem with the checks.

39:16.096 --> 39:16.965
- And a lot of that's-

39:16.965 --> 39:17.837
- I don't know what the problem is,

39:17.837 --> 39:18.705
but I know it's the same
two people doing it.

39:18.705 --> 39:20.829
- And you get to know about it first

39:20.829 --> 39:22.664
or do you have to go
asking for your salary?

39:22.664 --> 39:23.697
- I always ask for it.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.709
- That's absolutely
wrong, and the reason is-

39:25.709 --> 39:26.578
- He's lying?

39:26.578 --> 39:28.420
- No, no, no, he's not lying.

39:28.420 --> 39:30.891
I would rather have them
wait than write a check

39:30.891 --> 39:32.768
that's going to bounce, because I don't-

39:32.768 --> 39:35.646
- What, how about telling
him it's not gonna be ready?

39:35.646 --> 39:38.305
Rather than having to
ask, like some skivvy,

39:38.305 --> 39:41.034
cap in hand, "Please,
sir, may I get paid?"

39:43.393 --> 39:44.884
Anybody else have to wait?

39:44.884 --> 39:45.753
- [Waitress] Yes.

39:45.753 --> 39:46.622
- How long?

39:46.622 --> 39:48.252
- Five days, more, I have sleepless.

39:48.252 --> 39:49.121
- Barbara?

39:49.121 --> 39:50.505
- I had to wait five weeks.

39:50.505 --> 39:51.373
- You had to what?

39:51.373 --> 39:53.768
- I had to wait five weeks
before I got a paycheck.

39:53.768 --> 39:55.729
- Five weeks?

39:55.729 --> 39:59.211
Guys, you come in and
you work your ass off,

39:59.211 --> 40:00.504
the least these two guys can do

40:00.504 --> 40:02.673
is pay your fucking salary on time.

40:02.673 --> 40:05.217
- I don't have a secretary,
Gordon, I'm sorry.

40:05.217 --> 40:06.896
I'm trying to communicate with brides,

40:06.896 --> 40:08.387
I'm trying to send out things.

40:08.387 --> 40:12.183
I have to have peaceful
time in order to do my work.

40:12.183 --> 40:14.831
- Are you always this pathetic?

40:14.831 --> 40:16.332
- I am not pathetic.

40:16.332 --> 40:17.573
- Well, when are you gonna stand up

40:17.573 --> 40:20.034
and start showing some
respect for your team

40:20.034 --> 40:21.786
and start growing a pair

40:21.786 --> 40:23.757
to sort of understand the mess you're in?

40:23.757 --> 40:25.706
- I understand the mess we're in.

40:25.706 --> 40:27.688
I'm fighting for the team.

40:27.688 --> 40:29.846
- You dug the fucking hole.

40:29.846 --> 40:30.715
- Yes, we did.

40:30.715 --> 40:32.401
- And put them in it.

40:32.401 --> 40:33.269
So they're fucked.

40:33.269 --> 40:34.674
- They don't have to work here.

40:35.779 --> 40:36.648
- Oh, my God.

40:36.648 --> 40:37.885
- I mean, you know, the bottom line is-

40:37.885 --> 40:38.845
- Robert, how dare you?

40:38.845 --> 40:40.993
- No, they don't have to work here.

40:40.993 --> 40:42.424
- How dare you?

40:43.433 --> 40:45.059
How fucking dare you?

40:45.059 --> 40:47.940
They don't have to work here, oh my God.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.335
- I can't.

40:50.335 --> 40:53.828
- You disrespectful, disgusting man.

40:53.828 --> 40:55.882
They don't have to work here.

40:55.882 --> 41:00.137
I don't think you realise
how fucking lucky you are,

41:00.137 --> 41:01.649
because if it wasn't for one, two, three,

41:01.649 --> 41:04.099
four, five, six of them, you'd be driving

41:04.099 --> 41:06.177
that RV miles away from here.

41:07.373 --> 41:09.344
- Robert definitely needs a reality check.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.221
It's life or death right now.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.400
And I don't think he actually realises

41:13.400 --> 41:14.529
what kind of jeopardy this place is in.

41:14.529 --> 41:16.778
- This is not all about you, Robert.

41:16.778 --> 41:19.823
Robert's world, Robert's
bubble, Robert's dream.

41:19.823 --> 41:21.523
You're not the lord of the manor

41:21.523 --> 41:24.411
and you're not the Great
Gatsby, you're Robert.

41:24.411 --> 41:25.812
Is it only me in here, that's-

41:25.812 --> 41:27.602
- Excuse me, excuse me.

41:27.602 --> 41:29.552
- Go on then, you pompous fuck.

41:29.552 --> 41:30.973
- Excuse me.

41:31.887 --> 41:32.756
Don't talk to me like that.

41:32.756 --> 41:33.702
- What was wrong with it?

41:33.702 --> 41:34.570
I wanna know, what's wrong with it?

41:34.570 --> 41:35.730
- Don't speak to me like that.

41:35.730 --> 41:36.598
- Well, I'm telling you,

41:36.598 --> 41:37.467
you need to get your head out your ass

41:37.467 --> 41:39.979
and starting getting
a little fucking real.

41:39.979 --> 41:43.774
You still haven't got it
that this place is sinking.

41:43.774 --> 41:45.192
Start paying a little bit more attention

41:45.192 --> 41:47.111
to the guys on the ground,

41:47.111 --> 41:49.551
understand how hard it is out there.

41:49.551 --> 41:52.710
Forget your fucking antique road show,

41:52.710 --> 41:56.266
and start from the bottom,
running this business.

41:56.266 --> 41:59.801
You're right, there's no
structure, it's fragmented.

41:59.801 --> 42:03.776
The team need a leader,
they need a structure.

42:03.776 --> 42:07.391
They need a mentor,
they need some support,

42:07.391 --> 42:09.185
and all they get is nitpicks.

42:09.185 --> 42:11.124
What kind of motivation is that?

42:11.124 --> 42:13.460
All I've heard since I've been here,

42:13.460 --> 42:15.618
you just blaming people.

42:15.618 --> 42:18.674
Well I'm blaming you
for not taking charge.

42:18.674 --> 42:20.512
Get fucking real.

42:21.804 --> 42:24.671
(dramatic music)

42:34.904 --> 42:37.268
Next time, my hotel hell continues.

42:37.268 --> 42:39.799
Robert's mismanagement
spreads like a virus,

42:39.799 --> 42:41.843
this time taking down the kitchen.

42:41.843 --> 42:42.880
What's the matter with you?

42:42.880 --> 42:43.749
Now, do you want to give me your jacket

42:43.749 --> 42:44.762
and I'll do it for you?

42:44.762 --> 42:47.713
Open up, come on, you've just shut down.

42:47.713 --> 42:50.017
And there's a revelation so shocking.

42:50.017 --> 42:51.800
That is disgusting.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.897
I have to do something
I've never done before.

42:54.897 --> 42:56.159
I think my time's done here.

42:56.159 --> 42:57.622
- [Robert] Gordon left.

42:58.571 --> 43:01.289
- I cannot stand any
more of his bloody lies.

43:01.289 --> 43:04.198
- I just don't seem like
I can do it any more.

43:05.395 --> 43:06.524
I know I can't do it.

43:06.524 --> 43:08.066
- [Child] One potato, two potato.

43:08.066 --> 43:10.933
(tiger roaring)
