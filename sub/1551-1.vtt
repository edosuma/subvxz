<i>Send him in.</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:37.395
<i>Will you
commit to this program?</i>

02:39.333 --> 02:40.595
<i>I can't.</i>

02:51.211 --> 02:53.577
<i>Will you
commit to this program?</i>

03:02.723 --> 03:05.089
<i>Will you commit
to this program?</i>

03:06.927 --> 03:08.155
<i>I can't.</i>

04:13.494 --> 04:14.620
<i>There's no place
it won't catch up to you.</i>

04:14.695 --> 04:17.163
<i>It's how every story ends.</i>

04:17.231 --> 04:19.927
<i>It's what you are,
Jason, a killer.</i>

04:21.135 --> 04:22.534
<i>You always will be.</i>

04:22.603 --> 04:25.163
<i>Go ahead. Go on.
Go on! Do it! Do it!</i>

04:28.342 --> 04:30.401
<i>She wouldn't
want me to.</i>

04:30.477 --> 04:32.945
<i>That's the only
reason you're alive.</i>

04:33.013 --> 04:34.480
Who is "she"?

04:34.548 --> 04:37.312
Marie Kreutz, his girlfriend.

04:37.384 --> 04:39.045
She was killed in India.

04:39.119 --> 04:42.247
Director of Operations
Ward Abbott arranged it.

04:45.692 --> 04:49.355
So we have a dirty section
chief who kills Bourne's girl.

04:49.430 --> 04:52.661
Bourne comes back for revenge,
tapes Abbott's confession

04:52.733 --> 04:54.826
and Abbott commits suicide.

04:54.902 --> 04:57.063
Now Bourne's gunning for us.

04:57.504 --> 04:59.870
You couldn't
make this stuff up.

05:01.608 --> 05:05.271
Bourne's last confirmed
location was Moscow,
six weeks ago.

05:05.345 --> 05:06.369
Right.
Sir.

05:06.447 --> 05:08.142
He's on the run.
He's dangerous.

05:08.215 --> 05:11.446
Well, sir, with respect,
I think something else
could be going on here.

05:11.518 --> 05:13.850
What? What's he after?

05:13.921 --> 05:17.379
The reason Bourne went
to Moscow was to see the
daughter of his first target.

05:17.458 --> 05:18.789
What's your point, Pam?

05:18.859 --> 05:21.384
Maybe he was
retracing his steps.

05:21.462 --> 05:24.226
He's looking for something.
Something in his past.

05:24.298 --> 05:27.461
Maybe he hasn't found
it yet and we need
to know what it is.

05:27.534 --> 05:30.367
Are you telling me he's not
a threat to this agency?

05:30.437 --> 05:33.372
I think if he wanted
to hurt us, he could
have sent the tape to CNN.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.237
Maybe he still will.

05:36.743 --> 05:41.077
My number one rule is hope for
the best, plan for the worst.

05:42.616 --> 05:47.713
As far as I'm concerned,
Bourne is still a serious
threat until proven otherwise.

05:48.288 --> 05:49.312
Let's keep looking.

05:49.389 --> 05:51.254
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

06:33.500 --> 06:37.163
This one's three years
ago. They had half of Interpol
after him.

06:37.237 --> 06:40.934
Turned up in Naples,
Berlin, Moscow...

06:41.008 --> 06:42.703
Disappeared again.

06:44.178 --> 06:45.770
The girl that he
was on the run with.

06:46.914 --> 06:51.146
Marie Kreutz. She was found
dead in a river
halfway round the world.

06:51.652 --> 06:53.813
She'd been shot in the head.

06:55.689 --> 06:57.589
What connects the dots?

07:09.536 --> 07:11.629
Turn off the tape recorder.

08:00.420 --> 08:02.115
Where's my sister?

08:06.460 --> 08:08.394
Why don't you sit down?

08:19.873 --> 08:21.363
Where is she?

08:25.279 --> 08:26.678
She's dead.

08:29.850 --> 08:31.408
She was killed.

08:33.587 --> 08:34.952
I'm sorry.

08:45.799 --> 08:48.267
I knew this could
end this way.

08:51.972 --> 08:53.337
It was always
gonna end this way.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.637
I didn't believe that.

09:04.084 --> 09:05.915
And how did she die?

09:09.156 --> 09:10.646
She was shot.

09:13.660 --> 09:15.753
We were together in India.

09:18.298 --> 09:19.856
He came for me.

09:23.136 --> 09:24.694
You killed him?

09:28.041 --> 09:29.133
Yes.

09:30.210 --> 09:31.700
And now what?

09:34.581 --> 09:38.176
Someone started all of this
and I'm gonna find them.

09:49.963 --> 09:51.692
Hey. It's me.

09:51.765 --> 09:55.030
Yeah. He knows
the whole story.

09:56.036 --> 09:57.628
Bourne's just the
tip of the iceberg.

09:57.704 --> 10:00.571
Have you heard
of an Operation Blackbriar?

10:01.308 --> 10:02.741
I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.

10:02.809 --> 10:03.935
I'll see you first thing.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.170
Okay.

10:19.292 --> 10:23.160
Scanning. GoSat 21.
I have a hit on ECHELON.
Blackbriar.

10:23.230 --> 10:24.720
I repeat, Blackbriar.

10:24.798 --> 10:28.234
Looks like it's coming
from a European signal.

10:28.301 --> 10:30.030
NSA, please confirm
your receipt.

10:30.804 --> 10:32.669
I'll bring up the
frequency and the coordinates

10:32.739 --> 10:34.138
...intercept of
our principal...

10:34.207 --> 10:36.266
Sir!
What you got?

10:36.343 --> 10:39.244
We intercepted a call
in London. Keyword,
"Blackbriar."

10:39.312 --> 10:40.677
Okay, send it to
New York right away.

11:00.634 --> 11:01.658
Track the phone?

11:01.735 --> 11:03.760
Registered to a London
reporter named Simon Ross.

11:03.837 --> 11:05.464
<i>Works at the
Guardian newspaper.</i>

11:05.539 --> 11:06.904
You're tracking him?
Sir. Yeah.

11:06.973 --> 11:07.997
Thanks, Mike.

11:08.074 --> 11:10.508
We have a survey team
covering him at work

11:10.577 --> 11:12.511
and a sneak and peek's
on their way to his apartment.

11:12.579 --> 11:14.604
Well, who talked to him?
How did he find out
about Blackbriar?

11:14.681 --> 11:16.205
I don't know.
We pulled his background

11:16.283 --> 11:18.251
and ran a cross-check
on any known anomalies.

11:18.318 --> 11:21.344
We've come up with nothing.
But I think if we follow Ross,
we're gonna be able...

11:21.421 --> 11:24.151
Ray, Ross is easy.
We want the source.

11:41.141 --> 11:43.302
<i>Have you heard
of an Operation Blackbriar?</i>

11:43.376 --> 11:44.638
<i>You have details?</i>

11:44.711 --> 11:46.110
<i>I'm gonna get my head
around this and type it up.</i>

11:46.179 --> 11:48.511
<i>I'll see you first thing.</i>

11:48.582 --> 11:50.345
Is that all?
Yeah.

11:53.119 --> 11:57.453
I want rendition protocols
and put the asset on standby,
just in case.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.121
People, listen up!
This is a full priority
situation.

12:02.195 --> 12:03.719
Jimmy, give me
Ross' profile on one.

12:03.797 --> 12:05.389
Yes, sir.

12:07.868 --> 12:11.099
Our target is a British
national, Simon Ross.
A reporter.

12:11.171 --> 12:15.904
I want all his phones,
his BlackBerry, his apartment,
his car,

12:15.976 --> 12:18.206
bank accounts, credit cards,
travel patterns.

12:18.278 --> 12:20.371
I want to know what he's
gonna think before he does.

12:20.447 --> 12:22.244
Every dirty little
secret he has.

12:22.315 --> 12:26.649
And most of all, we want
the name and real-time
location of his source.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.951
This is NSA priority
level four. Any questions?

12:32.192 --> 12:33.489
All right, let's get to it.

13:05.992 --> 13:07.016
What?

13:10.030 --> 13:11.395
<i>Will you
commit to this program?</i>

13:16.570 --> 13:17.832
<i>I can't.</i>

14:09.489 --> 14:12.083
Copy that. Mr. Wills,
the subject is entering
his office.

14:12.158 --> 14:13.523
Give me some eyeballs
on the street.

14:13.593 --> 14:14.924
Where's my picture, please?

14:14.995 --> 14:16.428
Coming online.

14:16.496 --> 14:17.986
Online now.

14:19.633 --> 14:21.760
Jimmy, how you
doing with the phone line?

14:21.835 --> 14:24.736
Yeah, we have an
office line. We're working
on his cell.

14:24.804 --> 14:26.795
How long?
An hour, sir.

14:27.374 --> 14:28.432
That's too long.

14:29.309 --> 14:30.799
So how do we know he's not
spinning for someone?

14:30.877 --> 14:33.004
There was more. He was scared.

14:33.079 --> 14:35.445
Scared about what?
Blackbriar.

14:36.850 --> 14:38.647
Sorry. Call for you.
Who is it?

14:38.718 --> 14:40.709
Won't give his name.

14:40.787 --> 14:42.118
Excuse me.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.815
He's on my line.
Thanks.

14:48.662 --> 14:49.754
Simon Ross.

14:49.829 --> 14:51.160
Camera three, screen.

14:51.231 --> 14:52.528
Why aren't we hearing this?

14:52.599 --> 14:55.295
Jimmy? That's a hard line,
Jimmy. Why don't we have it?

14:55.368 --> 14:58.667
We have his line, sir,
but he's not on it.
He's using a different phone.

14:58.738 --> 15:01.070
<i>I've been
reading your stories.</i>

15:01.541 --> 15:03.736
<i>Who is this?
This is Jason Bourne.</i>

15:04.377 --> 15:08.245
Waterloo Station.
South entrance.
Thirty minutes. Come alone.

15:12.452 --> 15:13.817
Get me audio
as soon as you can, Ted.

15:13.887 --> 15:15.377
Street teams
Alpha, Bravo.

15:15.455 --> 15:16.888
Okay, guys,
let's work it. Come on.

15:16.956 --> 15:18.719
Where's he going?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.852
Okay, he is on the move.
Give me eyeballs
on the street. Let's go.

15:35.008 --> 15:36.202
Subject
exiting the building.

15:36.276 --> 15:38.676
All right,
everyone, let's find out
where he's going.

15:43.950 --> 15:45.747
<i>Mobile One,
I need audio.</i>

15:45.819 --> 15:47.116
<i>Audio engaged.</i>

15:47.187 --> 15:48.916
Mobile One should
have him. Mobile One should
have him.

15:48.988 --> 15:51.821
Get Mobile One on it.
Let me know when you hear it.

15:51.891 --> 15:54.291
<i>Hi. Waterloo Station,
south entrance.</i>

15:54.360 --> 15:55.520
Mr. Wills.
Where's he going?

15:55.595 --> 15:56.892
Destination is
Waterloo Station.

15:56.963 --> 15:57.987
Okay, Waterloo Station.

15:58.064 --> 16:00.532
Give me eyes at Waterloo.
Put everyone in play.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.625
<i>Let's
activate the asset.
Mobilize Tracker Three.</i>

16:22.622 --> 16:24.112
Are we at the bridge yet?
Not yet, sir.

16:24.190 --> 16:25.282
Okay, Mobile Three,
tell them to stay back.

16:25.358 --> 16:26.382
Sir.

16:26.459 --> 16:27.653
Please maintain
visual contact.

16:42.976 --> 16:44.204
Prepaid phone.

16:46.446 --> 16:47.936
Here you go.

16:55.355 --> 16:58.688
<i>Mobile One,
give me the subject's
current location.</i>

17:00.994 --> 17:02.120
Copy that.

17:02.195 --> 17:05.631
Sir, the subject is arriving
at the south entrance of
Waterloo Station.

17:50.777 --> 17:51.766
Hello?

17:51.845 --> 17:53.005
Give me that on five
and seven as well.

17:53.079 --> 17:54.171
Jimmy, I need that phone.

17:54.681 --> 17:57.582
<i>I want you to listen
very carefully to what I'm
about to tell you.</i>

17:57.650 --> 17:58.708
What the hell's going on?

17:58.785 --> 18:02.016
Ten o'clock, to your left,
across the street, there's
a silver Chrysler Voyager.

18:02.088 --> 18:04.352
<i>There's a surveillance
team inside.</i>

18:04.424 --> 18:06.392
<i>Directly across the street,
twelve noon,</i>

18:06.459 --> 18:08.393
<i>there's a man on the
second story, static post.</i>

18:08.461 --> 18:10.156
He's watching you.

18:10.663 --> 18:12.995
Now, there's a bus stop
50 meters to your left.

18:13.066 --> 18:14.055
I want you to walk towards it.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.101
Jimmy, I need that
phone! I need it yesterday.

18:16.169 --> 18:18.262
He's on the move.
He's on the move.

18:18.338 --> 18:19.498
That's not
his phone, sir.

18:19.572 --> 18:20.596
Say again?

18:20.673 --> 18:21.799
That's not his phone, sir.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.137
What do you mean
that's not his phone?

18:23.209 --> 18:24.938
Where the hell did
he get another phone?

18:25.345 --> 18:27.074
<i>Well, no,
you just have to...</i>

18:27.146 --> 18:28.579
<i>Grab Team B, stand by.</i>

18:28.648 --> 18:29.979
Grab Team B.
We're in position.

18:30.049 --> 18:32.108
All right, there's a man
in a blue hooded sweatshirt.

18:32.185 --> 18:35.211
<i>He's talking on a phone.
Walk directly to him and stop.</i>

18:35.288 --> 18:38.086
Jimmy, we need the
call. I need that cell phone.

18:38.157 --> 18:40.557
Do not let him
get out of sight.

18:40.627 --> 18:42.561
All right, turn around.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.293
Okay, who's the guy
in the blue hood?

18:49.369 --> 18:51.200
Is that his contact?

18:53.339 --> 18:55.364
All right, there's a bus
coming. It'll be there
in ten seconds.

18:55.441 --> 18:57.739
When it stops, I want you
to walk directly to your left.

18:57.810 --> 19:00.677
<i>There's an overpass.
Go up the stairs.
Stop at the newsstand.</i>

19:00.747 --> 19:02.214
<i>You'll get
further instructions.</i>

19:02.282 --> 19:03.909
Okay. Okay.

19:03.983 --> 19:05.075
Get ready to move.

19:05.551 --> 19:06.575
Watch that bus.
Watch that bus.

19:06.653 --> 19:07.881
What? All right,
what's going on?

19:07.954 --> 19:09.353
Somebody tell me.
We lost the feed.
Grab Team B.

19:09.422 --> 19:11.083
Intercept the contact
and stay with Ross.

19:14.727 --> 19:16.490
Hey! Stop!

19:18.164 --> 19:20.689
Mobile One.
Target's on the move.

19:22.302 --> 19:24.293
Okay, he's on the move.
Do not lose Ross.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.270
Blue hood! Down! Now!

19:29.642 --> 19:31.735
Go! Let's go.

19:31.811 --> 19:33.176
Oh, shit.

19:36.916 --> 19:37.905
What the hell was that?

19:40.753 --> 19:43.313
Sir, we've lost all
communication with Mobile One.

19:48.561 --> 19:50.791
To the right! Heading west.
Let us know when you get
a visual!

19:50.863 --> 19:52.922
What was the last
known position, please?

19:52.999 --> 19:56.435
On the walkway,
heading towards
the concourse, sir.

19:56.502 --> 20:00.598
It's a surveillance nightmare.
It's the busiest terminal
in London.

20:00.673 --> 20:02.402
Give me all of CCTV's eyes.

20:02.475 --> 20:03.499
On it, sir.

20:04.143 --> 20:05.371
Sir, asset's on scene.

20:31.070 --> 20:32.594
Who's your source?

20:32.672 --> 20:34.105
What's his name?
What's your source's name?

20:34.173 --> 20:36.539
Look, what's going on?
Why are these people after me?

20:36.609 --> 20:37.906
Because you found something.

20:37.977 --> 20:39.877
You talked to someone
inside Treadstone.

20:39.946 --> 20:41.743
Someone who was there at
the beginning. Who is it?

20:41.814 --> 20:43.111
You know I can't
tell you that.

20:43.182 --> 20:47.516
You have no idea what you're
into here. These people will
kill you, if they have to.

20:47.587 --> 20:49.646
Was it Blackbriar?
Is that what this is?

20:49.722 --> 20:51.019
What's Blackbriar?

20:51.090 --> 20:54.526
Treadstone upgrade.
My source told me
it all started with you.

20:54.594 --> 20:57.859
He said that
you were square one,
the dirty little secret.

20:57.930 --> 21:00.160
He said he knows
who you are.

21:03.736 --> 21:05.863
All right, we have to move.

21:06.706 --> 21:08.401
Answer your phone.

21:11.277 --> 21:13.711
Coming online.
You got visual?

21:14.781 --> 21:16.180
Where the hell is he, people?

21:19.385 --> 21:22.752
Do exactly as I say.
I need you to move
up to your right.

21:22.822 --> 21:25.086
First escalator on the right.

21:38.805 --> 21:42.297
Tie your shoe. Tie your shoe
right now. Tie your shoe.

21:49.348 --> 21:50.440
Wait.

21:51.517 --> 21:52.643
<i>Wait.</i>

21:57.423 --> 22:00.119
I'm gonna walk by you.
I want you to move along
the far wall

22:00.193 --> 22:04.186
to your left in four,
three, two, one.

22:04.297 --> 22:05.628
Stand up.

22:05.698 --> 22:07.063
That's it.

22:09.869 --> 22:11.598
Where the hell is he?

22:11.671 --> 22:13.730
We cannot afford
to lose this guy, people.

22:17.910 --> 22:21.812
All right, that line you're
on is good. Stay on that line.
Stay on that line.

22:21.881 --> 22:24.748
I've gotta go and pick
up the kids. Can you go and
get the shopping done?

22:24.817 --> 22:27.945
Oh, the bin man,
I think he's one of them.

22:28.020 --> 22:29.749
The garbage man? Negative.

22:29.822 --> 22:32.620
Oh, Jesus. Jesus!
He's reaching for something.

22:32.692 --> 22:33.784
Oh, God, he's got a gun.
Stay on the line.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.293
He's got a gun.
He's got a gun.

22:35.361 --> 22:36.988
Stay on the line you're on.
Do not deviate.

22:39.866 --> 22:41.231
Okay, there he is!
Here he goes.

22:41.300 --> 22:42.324
Grab Team A. Go!

22:42.401 --> 22:43.561
He's still talking
to somebody.

22:43.636 --> 22:45.331
He's getting instructions.
Jimmy, get me the
conversation.

22:45.404 --> 22:46.735
Mobile Two, I want...
Come on, lock the box.

22:46.806 --> 22:48.364
Lock the box.
Move in, Grab Team C.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.143
<i>Hurry, Ross. We gotta move.</i>

22:52.211 --> 22:53.838
Okay, move through this crowd.
Move through this crowd.

22:53.913 --> 22:55.608
Get undercover right now.
Move through this crowd.

23:04.023 --> 23:05.012
Get in the store.

23:05.091 --> 23:07.059
<i>There's someone on your tail.
Get in the store.</i>

23:07.126 --> 23:08.616
You're gonna proceed
out the east exit.

23:08.694 --> 23:11.822
That's to your right
as you come into the store.

23:20.173 --> 23:21.834
Head into the liquor
store in front of you.

23:21.908 --> 23:24.376
<i>Go into the back
and lock the door.</i>

23:25.378 --> 23:27.141
Mobile Four is down.

23:27.580 --> 23:31.175
This guy's got help.
Tell me when the asset's
in the nest.

23:35.555 --> 23:37.489
Get me a feed in there!

23:37.557 --> 23:40.754
I want Grab Team C in there.
Tell me what's going on.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.661
Team Four is mobile.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.232
Jesus Christ.

24:31.377 --> 24:33.368
That's Jason Bourne.

24:33.446 --> 24:36.540
He's picking us apart.
Do you think he's the source?

24:36.716 --> 24:38.240
He's gotta be.

24:41.220 --> 24:44.451
Block all the exits.
Give the asset a green light.

24:45.758 --> 24:47.521
Take them both out.

25:05.144 --> 25:06.702
Stay there.

25:07.713 --> 25:11.581
I'm gonna get us out of here.
You gotta do exactly
what I say.

25:12.018 --> 25:14.714
Listen to me! This isn't
some story in a newspaper.

25:14.787 --> 25:17.881
This is real.
You understand me?

25:18.357 --> 25:19.551
Okay.

25:30.336 --> 25:31.325
Call all agents back.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.895
Give Bourne's location
at the back of the store
to the asset.

25:33.973 --> 25:34.962
Yes, sir.

25:53.492 --> 25:55.119
Kill the cameras.

26:01.133 --> 26:03.226
<i>Bourne.
Wait. Something's not right.</i>

26:03.869 --> 26:06.337
I can see the entrance
from here. If I go now,
I can make it.

26:10.476 --> 26:11.602
Bourne?

26:11.677 --> 26:13.440
Just stay where you are.

26:13.612 --> 26:15.705
<i>I don't think
we should wait!</i>

26:17.049 --> 26:19.017
<i>I think someone's coming.</i>

26:19.085 --> 26:20.143
<i>I'm going for it.</i>

26:20.219 --> 26:21.379
No, no, no, no, no!

28:05.157 --> 28:06.954
We have a situation.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.456
Yeah.

28:13.532 --> 28:15.261
Director Kramer
would like to see you.

28:15.334 --> 28:16.460
We need to get
those warrants...

28:16.535 --> 28:18.833
He said it's urgent.

29:17.396 --> 29:21.196
<i>What the police will
tell me is that they believe
the victim is 35-year-old</i>

29:21.267 --> 29:24.668
<i>Simon Ross, a well-known
Journalist based here
in London</i>

29:24.737 --> 29:26.500
<i>with the Guardian newspaper.</i>

29:26.572 --> 29:29.166
<i>It appears that
he was gunned down</i>

29:29.241 --> 29:31.903
<i>right in the middle of the
Waterloo Station concourse</i>

29:31.977 --> 29:34.537
<i>around 3:45 this afternoon</i>

29:34.613 --> 29:37.309
<i>in full view of
hundreds of commuters.</i>

29:37.383 --> 29:38.941
<i>Over the years,
he's uncovered a lot of</i>

29:40.085 --> 29:41.985
<i>unsavory stories about terror</i>

29:42.054 --> 29:45.319
<i>that have upset certain
Western governments and...</i>

30:08.314 --> 30:10.544
Hi, how are you?
Right over there?

30:10.616 --> 30:11.810
All right.

30:12.551 --> 30:13.984
Good morning, sir.
Can I take your order?
Yes.

30:14.053 --> 30:18.922
I'll have the Heart-Healthy
omelet with goat cheese
and peppers, please.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.891
Anything for you, ma'am?
Just coffee, please.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.120
Are you sure? I'm buying.

30:22.194 --> 30:23.286
I'm good.

30:25.698 --> 30:29.156
So, when the Director called
and it was suggested that
we bring you on...

30:29.234 --> 30:32.203
Suggested? You sure it
was just a suggestion?

30:39.345 --> 30:41.370
You know, it's funny
how different things look

30:41.447 --> 30:44.245
depending on where
you sit, right?

30:44.617 --> 30:46.881
I look at this as
a favor for you, Pam,

30:46.952 --> 30:50.217
giving you an opportunity
to complete some unfinished
business.

30:50.289 --> 30:51.517
Meaning?

30:51.824 --> 30:55.282
Bourne. He's here.
He's a threat.

30:55.728 --> 30:57.719
And we both want
the same thing.

30:57.796 --> 31:00.356
But we both go about it
in two very different ways.

31:00.432 --> 31:02.957
The past is past,
Pam. All right?

31:04.103 --> 31:05.400
We were careless
in Stockholm.

31:05.471 --> 31:07.132
So what was Waterloo?
Just careless again?

31:07.206 --> 31:10.573
We had a leak. A serious
national security situation.

31:10.643 --> 31:13.510
Bourne showed up on our
surveillance and we had
very little time to react.

31:13.579 --> 31:15.877
And a reporter got killed.

31:15.948 --> 31:18.883
Bourne saw us coming.
The question is what
was he doing there?

31:18.951 --> 31:20.384
No, the real question
is how you managed

31:20.452 --> 31:22.943
to get into a firefight
at a public train station.

31:23.022 --> 31:26.116
You know as well as I do
decisions made in real
time are never perfect.

31:26.191 --> 31:30.287
Don't second-guess
an operation
from an armchair.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.527
I'll see you at the office.

31:36.902 --> 31:38.802
Enjoy your egg whites.

31:58.824 --> 32:00.291
People!

32:00.359 --> 32:03.522
This is Pamela Landy
and her associate, Tom Cronin.

32:03.595 --> 32:05.927
She's gonna be quarterbacking
the search effort.

32:05.998 --> 32:07.488
Say your names.
State your specs, please.

32:07.566 --> 32:11.627
Well, let's do names later,
okay? What's Bourne's last
fixed position?

32:11.704 --> 32:13.171
<i> London, 1200 Zulu.</i>

32:13.238 --> 32:15.263
Status. What is he?
Armed? Wounded?

32:15.340 --> 32:18.070
Alive,
mobile and unknown.

32:18.143 --> 32:19.633
Do we have an ECHELON package?
Yes.

32:19.712 --> 32:21.771
Why isn't it on?
We were waiting.

32:21.847 --> 32:24.111
Waiting? For what?
What... Listen,

32:24.183 --> 32:27.209
<i>people, do you have any idea
who you're dealing with?</i>

32:27.286 --> 32:28.446
<i>This is Jason Bourne.</i>

32:28.520 --> 32:32.012
<i>You are nine hours
behind the toughest target
you have ever tracked.</i>

32:32.091 --> 32:36.494
Now, I want everyone
to sit down, strap in
and turn on all you've got.

32:37.763 --> 32:39.458
That would mean now!

32:39.531 --> 32:40.964
Thank you.

32:41.033 --> 32:42.466
Give me a team
deployment plan.

32:42.534 --> 32:45.662
I want everything you got
on Ross on screen one.

33:08.093 --> 33:09.651
Sir,
I think we have something.

33:09.728 --> 33:11.696
<i>We just hacked Ross' e-mail
account at the Guardian.</i>

33:11.764 --> 33:14.358
Found a round-trip ticket
to Turin, Italy, yesterday.

33:14.433 --> 33:17.061
0800 arrival, 1205 departure.

33:17.136 --> 33:20.663
I think we can be pretty
certain that Bourne's
not your source, then.

33:20.739 --> 33:21.797
How?

33:21.874 --> 33:24.399
Ross's call to his editor
where he said he'd just
met the source

33:24.476 --> 33:27.502
took place just after
his Turin flight landed.

33:27.579 --> 33:29.740
He met his source in Turin.
So?

33:29.815 --> 33:32.340
What? So, what? Bourne met
Ross in Turin for breakfast

33:32.417 --> 33:35.716
and then at noon the same day
Bourne calls Ross to demand
a meet at Waterloo?

33:35.788 --> 33:37.653
Maybe they were even
on the same flight.

33:38.290 --> 33:39.621
Pull up
everything you've got.

33:39.691 --> 33:42.956
Cross-check the secure
cell phone usage of everyone
with SCI clearance

33:43.028 --> 33:46.156
against all calls going in
and out of Turin, Italy,
the morning Ross was there.

33:46.231 --> 33:49.758
This guy you're after is
a CIA operative with clearance
above top secret.

33:49.835 --> 33:52.565
He's committing treason
by talking to Ross.

33:52.638 --> 33:53.662
Do you really think
while doing that

33:53.739 --> 33:55.832
he's gonna use a cell phone
that he knows we can track?

33:55.908 --> 33:57.603
Zero results
on the cross-check.

33:57.676 --> 33:59.405
So, you got any better ideas?

33:59.478 --> 34:01.639
Yeah, look at all the people
whose cell phones were
switched off

34:01.713 --> 34:03.374
the entire period
Ross was in Turin.

34:03.448 --> 34:05.245
I mean, if your people are on
their phones as much as mine,

34:05.317 --> 34:07.683
the list should
be pretty small.

34:12.257 --> 34:15.954
Three names. Tom Brewster,
Jack Boulin and Neal Daniels.

34:16.027 --> 34:18.860
Okay, now check everything
in Ross' apartment against
those names.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.592
Check for common patterns.

34:20.666 --> 34:23.100
Look for anything that
indicates who Ross met.

34:23.168 --> 34:25.466
Pull up his socials.
Pull it up.

34:25.536 --> 34:26.936
See those documents?

34:27.005 --> 34:28.563
Break it.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.333
Over here. What is that?

34:31.577 --> 34:34.273
All right. Right there.
Initials.

34:34.346 --> 34:37.076
Pull that up.
Bring that up on main.

34:41.085 --> 34:42.576
Neal Daniels.

34:42.654 --> 34:44.485
He's station chief
in Madrid, isn't he?

34:44.556 --> 34:45.784
Yeah.

34:49.695 --> 34:51.560
All right, call the RSO
at the embassy.

34:51.630 --> 34:53.996
Have them take Daniels
into custody, if he is there.

34:54.065 --> 34:56.933
Anna, get grab teams
to the Calle Norte safe house.

34:57.002 --> 34:59.527
Send them in heavy.
Tell them we'll assist
with the entry.

34:59.605 --> 35:01.698
Heavy? Daniels isn't
really that much of a...

35:01.773 --> 35:03.138
I'm worried about Bourne.

35:03.208 --> 35:04.698
If he is not the source,

35:04.776 --> 35:07.244
then he is after the source,
the same as we are.

35:41.079 --> 35:42.546
ETA, Team Two.

35:42.614 --> 35:44.104
Three minutes
to destination, sir.

36:07.906 --> 36:11.933
<i>Your mission
will save American lives.</i>

36:16.348 --> 36:19.943
Really give yourself
to this program.

36:20.752 --> 36:21.946
<i>I can't.</i>

36:22.387 --> 36:23.615
<i>You can.</i>

37:01.626 --> 37:03.992
Sir, they're at
the front door.

37:22.447 --> 37:24.381
Five seconds.
Put it up live.

37:32.991 --> 37:34.322
<i>We're in.</i>

37:37.896 --> 37:39.727
The alarm's down.

37:40.365 --> 37:41.855
That's gotta be Bourne.

37:55.313 --> 37:56.940
<i>The safe is empty.
Shit.</i>

37:57.015 --> 37:58.812
<i>Looks like he left in a hurry.</i>

37:58.884 --> 38:00.215
Track Daniels' passports.

38:00.285 --> 38:01.547
Stand by.

38:33.718 --> 38:34.980
Hammond.

38:59.611 --> 39:01.408
God damn it!
Get a backup team in there!

39:12.991 --> 39:16.085
Get me a secure line in there.
Get the second team
over there now!

39:26.204 --> 39:28.195
What are you doing here?

39:29.641 --> 39:31.973
I was posted
here after Berlin.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.807
Where's Daniels?

39:39.284 --> 39:40.717
Where is he?

40:04.509 --> 40:05.498
Hello?

40:05.577 --> 40:06.771
Who is this?

40:07.879 --> 40:09.779
This is Nicky Parsons.

40:11.550 --> 40:13.518
She was Treadstone. Logistics.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.748
She was with us when
we hunted Bourne in Berlin.

40:20.926 --> 40:23.156
Nicky, I need to
do an ID challenge.

40:23.228 --> 40:24.923
Code in, Sparrow.

40:35.173 --> 40:36.265
Response, Everest.

40:41.346 --> 40:45.510
Nicky, this is Noah Vosen.
How long have you been
on-site?

40:45.584 --> 40:47.245
I just walked in.

40:48.320 --> 40:52.051
<i>We have two officers on-site.
Are you in contact with them?</i>

40:55.393 --> 40:58.692
They're down.
Unconscious but alive.

41:02.901 --> 41:04.664
Any sign of Neal Daniels?

41:04.736 --> 41:05.794
No.

41:06.471 --> 41:08.598
Nicky, this is Pam Landy.

41:09.441 --> 41:11.409
<i>We have reason to believe
there's a connection between</i>

41:11.476 --> 41:13.774
Neal Daniels and Jason Bourne.

41:15.447 --> 41:19.440
Bourne? You're still looking
for Bourne? I thought that
case was closed.

41:19.517 --> 41:22.350
No, some people are convinced
he's still a threat.

41:22.420 --> 41:24.888
I disagree, but to find out
I need to talk to him.

41:24.956 --> 41:26.548
Hold on, Nicky.

41:28.293 --> 41:30.386
What the hell are you doing?
I'm trying to send
him a message.

41:30.462 --> 41:32.828
You don't think Bourne
is a threat? He just took
out two more of my men.

41:32.897 --> 41:34.489
The only way this has
a happy ending, Noah,

41:34.566 --> 41:35.794
is if we bring him in alive.

41:35.867 --> 41:37.801
He is going after Daniels.

41:37.869 --> 41:39.598
He wants revenge, Pam,
and the only realistic way

41:39.671 --> 41:41.696
to end this is to
eliminate the threat.

41:41.773 --> 41:43.673
How long until backup?

41:45.010 --> 41:47.638
Nicky, I need you to stay put
and secure the premises.

41:47.712 --> 41:51.614
<i>Backup will be arriving
in approximately one hour.
Do you copy?</i>

41:54.586 --> 41:55.917
<i>Copy, sir.</i>

42:00.892 --> 42:02.154
How long do I have?

42:02.227 --> 42:03.319
Three minutes.

42:05.897 --> 42:07.558
My car's outside.

42:09.100 --> 42:11.091
I know where Daniels is.

42:29.921 --> 42:31.388
Come on.

42:32.090 --> 42:33.387
Two minutes
to destination, sir.

42:33.458 --> 42:34.584
Grab Teams A and B...

42:35.327 --> 42:36.453
Where was Daniels headed?

42:36.528 --> 42:40.897
At 8:00 this morning,
he wired $100,000 to
a bank account in Tangier.

42:41.700 --> 42:45.534
Right, that's 300 miles away.
If we hurry, we can make
the morning ferry.

42:46.671 --> 42:47.660
Where are you parked?

42:47.739 --> 42:51.004
To the right, 20 meters,
north side of the street.

42:56.648 --> 42:57.740
They're coming.

42:57.816 --> 42:58.908
Keep moving.

43:00.185 --> 43:02.813
Two subjects seen
exiting safe house.

43:14.866 --> 43:15.890
What the hell is this?

43:16.668 --> 43:18.727
Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no!

43:25.410 --> 43:27.173
What the hell just happened?

43:27.245 --> 43:28.906
We've lost visual contact
with the subjects, sir.

43:28.980 --> 43:29.969
Christ!

43:32.550 --> 43:36.714
Issue a standing kill
order on Jason Bourne,
effective immediately.

43:37.922 --> 43:40.186
Send out a system one alert
to all Spanish contacts.

43:40.258 --> 43:44.388
I want all air and ground
border exits locked down.

44:05.817 --> 44:07.444
What's going on?

44:09.187 --> 44:11.018
What's Daniels got?

44:12.590 --> 44:14.751
What's Operation Blackbriar?

44:16.795 --> 44:20.561
Do you want to tell me,
or should I call Kramer
and ask him?

44:24.302 --> 44:26.395
For Christ's sake, Pam,
we're in the middle
of an operation.

44:26.471 --> 44:27.768
Bullshit.

44:29.007 --> 44:30.998
You want Jason Bourne,

44:31.943 --> 44:33.433
level with me.

44:41.486 --> 44:45.320
Operation Blackbriar started
as an NEAT surveillance
program.

44:45.390 --> 44:46.584
And what is it now?

44:46.658 --> 44:49.991
It is now the umbrella program
for all our black ops.

44:50.061 --> 44:53.827
Full envelope intrusion,
rendition, experimental
interrogation

44:53.898 --> 44:56.196
is all run
out of this office.

44:58.136 --> 45:01.264
We are the sharp end
of the stick now, Pam.

45:01.339 --> 45:02.863
Lethal action?

45:03.842 --> 45:05.639
If we have to, sure.

45:06.945 --> 45:10.381
That's what makes us special.
No more red tape.

45:11.349 --> 45:13.442
No more getting the bad guys
caught in our sights,

45:13.518 --> 45:14.780
then watching them escape

45:14.853 --> 45:17.014
while we wait for someone
in Washington to issue
the order.

45:18.523 --> 45:19.956
Oh, come on.

45:21.693 --> 45:25.254
You've seen the raw intel,
Pam. You know how real
the danger is.

45:25.330 --> 45:27.855
We need these programs now.

45:27.932 --> 45:29.900
What's the connection
to Daniels?

45:29.968 --> 45:33.665
He ran all of our operations
in Southern Europe
and North Africa,

45:33.738 --> 45:35.171
so he has everything.

45:35.240 --> 45:38.937
Names, dates, ghost sites,
who's cooperating
with us abroad.

45:39.010 --> 45:40.875
Every operation.

45:40.945 --> 45:43.778
You want that stuff
in Bourne's hands, out on the
market to the highest bidder?

45:43.848 --> 45:45.509
I don't think so.

45:47.418 --> 45:51.081
Bourne's not after money.
He's after Daniels
for a reason.

45:51.890 --> 45:54.484
Well, what does it matter
what Bourne is after?

45:54.559 --> 45:57.960
When we find Daniels,
and, believe me,
we'll find him,

45:58.029 --> 45:59.724
if you're right,

46:00.398 --> 46:02.298
we get Bourne, too.

46:30.962 --> 46:32.862
Why did you come back?

46:35.099 --> 46:37.465
Why are you
looking for Daniels?

46:47.111 --> 46:49.136
Do you know who that is?

46:50.548 --> 46:52.106
That's Daniels.

46:54.018 --> 46:56.578
I don't know who that is.
Who is he?

47:02.260 --> 47:04.524
He was there
at the beginning.

47:05.630 --> 47:07.655
I remember meeting him.

47:10.134 --> 47:11.726
The first day.

47:11.803 --> 47:13.862
Daniels brought me to him.

47:16.541 --> 47:18.873
That's where it all
started for me.

47:19.577 --> 47:23.479
Something happened to me
and I need to know what it was

47:25.583 --> 47:28.051
or I'll never
be free of this.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.821
Daniels said the training
was experimental.

47:34.626 --> 47:36.560
Behavior modification.

47:37.629 --> 47:41.292
They had to break down
the agents before they
became operational.

47:43.034 --> 47:45.366
He said you
were the first one.

47:48.473 --> 47:50.464
Why are you helping me?

48:01.285 --> 48:03.344
It was difficult for me

48:04.956 --> 48:06.253
with you.

48:22.106 --> 48:24.631
You really don't
remember anything.

48:28.613 --> 48:29.671
No.

48:38.356 --> 48:39.983
We have to move.

48:49.634 --> 48:52.899
Sir? Mr. Wills? You're gonna
want to look at this.

49:03.681 --> 49:05.342
He's in Tangier.

49:12.290 --> 49:13.723
Noah Vosen.

49:23.134 --> 49:25.034
We have found Daniels.

49:29.607 --> 49:32.440
They've just tracked
Daniels' passport
to a hotel in Tangier.

49:32.510 --> 49:34.410
They're holding up
a bank transfer he made
to keep him in place

49:34.479 --> 49:37.175
while they bring an asset
up from Casablanca.

49:37.248 --> 49:38.738
They're gonna take him out.

49:47.058 --> 49:48.047
Yeah.

49:48.126 --> 49:50.151
<i>WOIt's Pam Landy.
She says it's urgent.</i>

49:51.963 --> 49:53.396
Tell her I'm unavailable.

49:53.464 --> 49:54.488
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

50:49.187 --> 50:51.519
Sir, asset has
arrived at the airport.

51:13.744 --> 51:16.212
Give me the
subject's location.

51:16.280 --> 51:19.545
Subject is now on foot
and entering Hotel Velasquez.

51:19.617 --> 51:21.676
Hotel is 2.2 kilometers
from the bank.

51:23.521 --> 51:26.718
All right, get an elevation
and a floor plan, tic-tac-toe.

51:26.791 --> 51:27.917
Locate the room.

51:27.992 --> 51:29.425
Give the asset
subject location

51:29.493 --> 51:31.427
and the route between the
subject's hotel and the bank.

51:48.145 --> 51:49.169
Do we have
that room yet?

51:49.247 --> 51:51.477
Yes, sir. It's room 117.

51:52.083 --> 51:54.449
All right, get a hold
of the hotel trunk line.

51:54.518 --> 51:58.113
Run all calls through here
with an ISO on room 117.

52:11.736 --> 52:14.000
His location's being
blocked by the firewall.

52:14.071 --> 52:16.505
No, they found Daniels.
They know where he is.

52:16.574 --> 52:18.405
They'll get one of the
operatives to terminate him.

52:18.476 --> 52:19.966
Find out who.

52:23.848 --> 52:24.974
<i>Desh.</i>

52:27.818 --> 52:30.753
Tell him you're gonna
meet him and you have
a new phone for him.

52:30.821 --> 52:32.982
If you stop Desh,
they'll just get someone else.

52:33.057 --> 52:35.048
No, we're not gonna stop him,
we're gonna follow him.

52:35.126 --> 52:36.388
He'll take us
right to Daniels.

53:14.598 --> 53:17.328
Sir, the asset is
deviating off course.

53:19.737 --> 53:21.170
Let it play.

53:53.537 --> 53:55.471
Asset unscheduled stop.

54:26.137 --> 54:29.004
Sir, asset is on the move
en route to subject.

54:29.073 --> 54:31.234
Sir, we have
an unauthorized breach.

54:31.308 --> 54:34.505
Someone with active system
knowledge penetrated
our protocol.

54:34.578 --> 54:38.446
Instructions were sent to
the asset at 1411 local time.

54:38.516 --> 54:40.211
Trace is confirmed and valid.

54:40.284 --> 54:43.583
It came from a computer
belonging to Nicky Parsons.

54:47.158 --> 54:49.023
Where did the
course deviation occur?

54:49.093 --> 54:51.687
South to Rue de Belgique,
stationary Place de France.

54:52.863 --> 54:54.922
That's where Parsons is.

54:54.999 --> 54:57.229
When we're finished with
Daniels, send the asset
after her.

54:57.301 --> 54:58.290
Yes, sir.

54:58.369 --> 55:00.599
We find Parsons,
we find Bourne.

55:00.671 --> 55:02.696
Noah, what are you doing?

55:03.074 --> 55:04.666
Not now.
I wanna know what's going on.

55:04.742 --> 55:06.107
I said not now!

55:06.177 --> 55:08.475
What basis are you continuing
this operation on?

55:08.546 --> 55:11.379
On the basis that
Nicky Parsons has compromised
a covert operation.

55:11.449 --> 55:12.643
She is up to her neck
in this!

55:12.716 --> 55:14.377
This is about Daniels,
not Nicky!

55:14.452 --> 55:15.646
She has betrayed us.

55:15.719 --> 55:17.311
You don't know
the circumstances, Noah.

55:17.388 --> 55:19.185
She's in league
with Jason Bourne,
for Christ's sakes!

55:19.256 --> 55:22.123
You do not have the
authority to kill her!

55:22.193 --> 55:25.287
Oh, yes, I do. And you
had better get on board.

55:25.362 --> 55:27.330
Noah, she's one of us.

55:27.398 --> 55:30.367
You start down this path,
where does it end?

55:31.001 --> 55:32.969
It ends when we've won.

55:46.383 --> 55:49.318
When we're finished with
Daniels, send the asset
after them.

55:49.386 --> 55:50.546
Yes, sir.

55:50.621 --> 55:52.680
Okay, come on.
Stand by...

56:13.144 --> 56:14.577
Two minutes, sir.
Two minutes.

56:14.645 --> 56:17.375
Tell the bank
to release the funds.

56:32.696 --> 56:33.856
Hello?

56:42.039 --> 56:43.700
He's on the move.

57:21.745 --> 57:22.837
On it, sir.

57:22.913 --> 57:24.073
Two hundred meters.

57:24.148 --> 57:25.945
Okay, come on,
I want to lay in
some preliminary tracking.

01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:21.795
Code it in.
We need to be dead.

01:09:29.606 --> 01:09:32.473
Sir? Asset confirms
both targets are down.

01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:44.577
I want to be sure
about this.

01:09:44.654 --> 01:09:46.747
Ask the station chief
from Rabat
to confirm the deaths

01:09:46.823 --> 01:09:48.551
and do
a sub-rosa collection
of the bodies.

01:09:48.625 --> 01:09:50.616
I want to
tie this thing off
completely.

01:09:50.694 --> 01:09:52.752
And keep an eye on Landy.

01:10:02.839 --> 01:10:03.863
Yeah?

01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:05.601
<i>Bourne and Nicky Parsons
are dead.</i>

01:10:06.176 --> 01:10:07.507
You sure about that?

01:10:07.577 --> 01:10:10.444
<i>Our station chief
in Rabat is confirming.</i>

01:10:11.882 --> 01:10:14.350
I can't afford to have this
come back to me.

01:10:15.318 --> 01:10:17.582
Don't worry.
You're protected.

01:10:17.988 --> 01:10:20.650
Just remember
why we put Landy there.

01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:23.716
If Blackbriar goes south,

01:10:23.794 --> 01:10:26.763
we'll roll it up,
hang it around her neck
and start over.

01:11:35.198 --> 01:11:37.098
I can see their faces.

01:11:43.073 --> 01:11:45.132
Everyone I ever killed.

01:11:47.644 --> 01:11:49.908
I just don't know
their names.

01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:07.563
Marie used to try to

01:12:10.167 --> 01:12:12.328
help me remember the names.

01:12:24.814 --> 01:12:27.044
I've tried to
apologize for...

01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:29.814
For what I've done.

01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:35.114
For what I am.

01:12:38.028 --> 01:12:40.360
None of it
makes it any better.

01:12:56.513 --> 01:12:58.947
They're gonna
come for you again.

01:13:03.954 --> 01:13:06.184
You're gonna
have to run now.

01:14:30.106 --> 01:14:31.596
We should go.

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:02.028
It gets easier.

01:16:04.033 --> 01:16:06.524
Station chief in Rabat
just called.

01:16:06.603 --> 01:16:08.298
They found a body.

01:16:10.807 --> 01:16:12.365
Bourne?
Desh.

01:16:19.682 --> 01:16:21.741
Pam. You need to see this.

01:16:29.325 --> 01:16:32.192
A passport
for Gilberto de Piento
just cleared immigration.

01:16:32.262 --> 01:16:35.663
It's an early
Treadstone identity
registered to Jason Bourne,

01:16:35.732 --> 01:16:38.826
but he never used it,
and it never
went to the grid.

01:16:38.902 --> 01:16:40.460
Bourne's alive.

01:16:48.077 --> 01:16:49.101
They don't know?

01:16:49.179 --> 01:16:52.171
Well, if they knew,
Vosen wouldn't be
in his office right now.

01:16:52.248 --> 01:16:53.715
It's a hell of a risk.

01:16:55.018 --> 01:16:57.486
<i>Maybe Bourne wants
us to know.</i>

01:16:57.554 --> 01:17:00.921
<i>Just like Naples.
Maybe he's communicating.</i>

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:04.150
Maybe he's trying to
communicate with you.

01:17:04.227 --> 01:17:06.593
Then we should
communicate back.

01:17:07.564 --> 01:17:09.555
I think I know
what Bourne's
looking for.

01:17:17.974 --> 01:17:20.841
<i>MAN ON PA:
Gilberto de Piento.
Gilberto de Piento.</i>

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.208
<i>Your party
is waiting for you.</i>

01:18:55.572 --> 01:18:57.062
Pamela Landy.

01:18:57.140 --> 01:18:59.074
<i>I hear you're still
looking for me.</i>

01:19:02.545 --> 01:19:03.705
Bourne?

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:05.441
<i>What do you want?</i>

01:19:08.985 --> 01:19:10.009
Yeah?

01:19:10.086 --> 01:19:12.350
<i>WILLS O VER INTERCOM:
Better get in here.
We got a situation.</i>

01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:14.315
I...

01:19:15.925 --> 01:19:18.621
I wanted to thank you
for the tape.

01:19:19.929 --> 01:19:22.989
<i>LAND Y ON SPEAKER:
It's all tied off. It's over.</i>

01:19:23.066 --> 01:19:25.296
<i>I guess I owe you
an apology.</i>

01:19:26.603 --> 01:19:28.400
Is that official?

01:19:28.471 --> 01:19:31.338
<i>No. Off the record.
You know how it is.</i>

01:19:31.407 --> 01:19:32.396
You tracing this?

01:19:32.475 --> 01:19:33.965
Fifty seconds
to trace.

01:19:34.043 --> 01:19:35.943
Goodbye.
Wait. Wait.

01:19:38.781 --> 01:19:41.215
David Webb.
That's your real name.

01:19:43.219 --> 01:19:47.053
<i>You were born 4/15/71
in Nixa, Missouri.</i>

01:19:47.824 --> 01:19:50.850
<i>Why don't you come in
and we'll talk about it?</i>

01:19:51.728 --> 01:19:53.958
Something is
very wrong here.

01:19:56.265 --> 01:19:57.596
Bourne?

01:19:59.636 --> 01:20:01.103
Get some rest, Pam.

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.762
<i>You look tired.</i>

01:20:05.074 --> 01:20:07.133
He's looking right at her.

01:20:10.146 --> 01:20:11.238
People, listen up!

01:20:11.314 --> 01:20:13.214
This is a national
security emergency.

01:20:13.282 --> 01:20:15.250
We have an imminent threat.

01:20:15.318 --> 01:20:16.979
I'm going out there.

01:20:17.053 --> 01:20:19.419
If I show myself,
he'll find me.

01:20:19.489 --> 01:20:22.356
Jason Bourne is alive
and is at large
in New York City,

01:20:22.425 --> 01:20:24.825
and, we believe,
within 1,000 yards
of this building.

01:20:24.894 --> 01:20:27.556
I want an immediate
12-block lockdown
of the area.

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:29.188
Send a flash message
to Langley.

01:20:29.265 --> 01:20:31.597
Prep for local backup
assistance.

01:20:33.736 --> 01:20:35.169
Landy just left
the building!

01:20:35.238 --> 01:20:36.671
Stay with her phone.

01:20:53.589 --> 01:20:56.717
She's using her cell.
There's an incoming text.

01:20:56.793 --> 01:20:58.021
Get it.
Working on it, sir.

01:20:58.094 --> 01:20:59.186
How many do we have
on Landy?

01:20:59.262 --> 01:21:00.422
Six men.
More on the way.

01:21:00.496 --> 01:21:03.727
I've got it, sir!
Coming up
on the screen now.

01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:10.735
Anybody not on Landy
goes directly
to Tudor City.

01:21:10.807 --> 01:21:13.275
Get the vehicles.
We're going mobile.

01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:16.340
Team Two. Team Two.
All teams, call in.

01:21:52.548 --> 01:21:54.106
178th.

01:21:58.554 --> 01:22:00.283
There's only one way
out of there.
Why would he do that?

01:22:00.356 --> 01:22:01.653
He's trapping himself.

01:22:01.724 --> 01:22:03.487
It's a bad place to meet.
It's too exposed.

01:22:03.559 --> 01:22:05.493
He wouldn't have chosen it
if he didn't have a reason.

01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:13.594
Subject is en route.

01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:15.603
<i>Roof 43,
let me know
when you have visual.</i>

01:22:15.671 --> 01:22:17.468
<i>Roof 43, standing by.</i>

01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.204
Standing by.

01:22:25.281 --> 01:22:28.648
Okay, folks, here we go.
Box 200 meters.

01:22:28.718 --> 01:22:30.049
Visual on leader.

01:22:30.119 --> 01:22:32.451
<i>43 ground in position.</i>

01:22:32.922 --> 01:22:35.652
As soon as
you have eyes on Landy,
I wanna know.

01:22:50.206 --> 01:22:51.366
Okay, here we go.

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:53.271
Copy that. I see her.

01:23:05.354 --> 01:23:07.322
Any sign of Bourne?

01:23:07.390 --> 01:23:08.652
<i>Negative.</i>

01:23:09.725 --> 01:23:11.454
<i>No sign of target.</i>

01:23:22.805 --> 01:23:24.204
Noah Vosen.

01:23:25.274 --> 01:23:26.764
This is Jason Bourne.

01:23:28.077 --> 01:23:30.773
I was wondering
when you were going to
make this call.

01:23:30.847 --> 01:23:32.405
<i>How did you
get this number?</i>

01:23:32.481 --> 01:23:36.383
You didn't actually think
I was coming
to Tudor City, did you?

01:23:38.354 --> 01:23:39.878
No, I guess not.

01:23:39.956 --> 01:23:41.821
But if it's me
you want to talk to,

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:44.359
perhaps we can
arrange a meet.

01:23:44.427 --> 01:23:46.190
Where are you now?

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:49.122
I'm sitting in my office.

01:23:50.499 --> 01:23:51.989
I doubt that.

01:23:52.535 --> 01:23:54.366
And why would
you doubt that?

01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:55.836
If you were
in your office right now,

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:58.965
we'd be having
this conversation
face to face.

01:24:05.982 --> 01:24:07.381
<i> Noah Vosen.</i>

01:24:10.419 --> 01:24:12.148
This is a code ten abort.

01:24:12.221 --> 01:24:14.689
I want everyone
back in the vehicles.
This is a code ten abort.

01:24:14.757 --> 01:24:16.520
Let's go! Let's go!

01:24:39.015 --> 01:24:40.073
Yeah?

01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:41.446
Wills, check my office.

01:24:46.188 --> 01:24:47.177
Damn it!

01:24:47.256 --> 01:24:48.883
<i>What's going on?</i>

01:24:51.894 --> 01:24:54.362
We need building security
up here.

01:24:55.631 --> 01:24:57.496
<i>He's got everything.
God damn it!</i>

01:24:57.566 --> 01:24:59.659
All right,
set a four-block perimeter
around the building.

01:24:59.735 --> 01:25:01.032
Somebody
give me a visual.

01:25:01.103 --> 01:25:02.502
I want the entire building
searched.

01:25:02.571 --> 01:25:05.904
Every room, every hallway,
every closet,
every goddamn air duct.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:07.966
You understand?
I want him found!

01:25:11.614 --> 01:25:12.876
What just happened?

01:25:12.949 --> 01:25:16.441
Bourne just broke into CRI.
He got into Vosen's safe.

01:25:18.421 --> 01:25:19.615
Where to?

01:25:19.689 --> 01:25:22.021
415 East 71st Street.

01:25:22.858 --> 01:25:25.884
Four-fifteen-seventy-one?
Jesus, Pam.

01:25:51.454 --> 01:25:53.115
Target in sight.

01:25:57.893 --> 01:25:59.485
North on Eighth.

01:26:06.535 --> 01:26:08.025
He's headed east
in the Port Authority.

01:26:08.104 --> 01:26:10.072
All agents have
shoot-on-sight
authorization.

01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:36.263
Right there!

01:27:19.075 --> 01:27:20.508
Sir, he drove off the roof.
What?

01:27:20.576 --> 01:27:22.476
He drove off the roof!

01:27:23.913 --> 01:27:26.040
He's on foot.
He's running.

01:27:36.692 --> 01:27:37.920
Police! Freeze!

01:27:37.993 --> 01:27:39.756
Put your hands
in the air!

01:27:49.371 --> 01:27:50.998
Call for backup!

01:28:15.531 --> 01:28:18.261
Sir, sir,
take a look at this!
Bourne's birthday, sir.

01:28:18.334 --> 01:28:19.665
What about it?
Check that out.

01:28:19.735 --> 01:28:24.104
<i>Sir, Landy told Bourne
that his birthday
was 4l15l71.</i>

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:26.808
Oh, my God. It's a code.

01:28:27.443 --> 01:28:30.071
Everything stops.
Everything stops!
Listen up!

01:28:30.146 --> 01:28:32.979
<i>4l15l71.
New assignment, numbers.</i>

01:28:33.048 --> 01:28:34.913
What does it mean?
Give me encryption codes!

01:28:34.984 --> 01:28:37.544
Sir, if you plug them in
as variables
of longitude and latitude

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:39.383
you get Cameroon.

01:28:39.455 --> 01:28:42.424
41571 is the zip code
for Varney, Kentucky.

01:28:45.327 --> 01:28:46.521
What date did she give him?

01:28:46.595 --> 01:28:49.223
<i>4/15/71.</i>

01:28:49.298 --> 01:28:51.061
I don't believe it.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:55.263
SRD is at 415
East 71st Street.

01:28:55.337 --> 01:28:57.066
<i>She just gave him
the training facility.</i>

01:28:57.139 --> 01:28:58.265
Oh, Christ.

01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.774
Bring all the teams
in behind us.

01:30:59.228 --> 01:31:00.923
Hurry up!
Somebody call 911!

01:31:00.996 --> 01:31:02.020
Help him!

01:31:36.365 --> 01:31:38.925
<i>The asset lost Bourne.
We lost him.</i>

01:31:47.076 --> 01:31:49.203
Hello?
Albert, it's Vosen.

01:31:50.446 --> 01:31:54.143
Bourne knows everything
and he's on his way
to you right now.

01:31:54.683 --> 01:31:56.913
He's coming home, Noah.

01:31:56.985 --> 01:31:58.816
<i>How long do I have?</i>

01:31:58.887 --> 01:32:00.115
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:02.521
Just get the hell
out of there.

01:32:02.624 --> 01:32:04.592
No, I'm gonna stay.

01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:08.187
<i>He'll head for
the training wing.
That's what he knows.</i>

01:32:08.464 --> 01:32:12.298
I'll keep him in play
till you get there.

01:33:03.485 --> 01:33:05.510
They'll kill you
for giving me this.

01:33:05.587 --> 01:33:08.488
<i>4l15l71 isn't
much of a code.</i>

01:33:08.557 --> 01:33:11.321
My guess is Vosen
is on his way already.

01:33:12.261 --> 01:33:14.092
Why'd you do it?

01:33:14.163 --> 01:33:16.290
Because this isn't
what I signed up for,

01:33:16.365 --> 01:33:18.663
what they did to you,
Blackbriar.

01:33:19.101 --> 01:33:20.625
This isn't us.

01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:26.369
Then do something about it.
Everything you need
is in there.

01:33:30.612 --> 01:33:32.011
Everything.

01:33:33.382 --> 01:33:36.647
David. Why don't
you come in with me?

01:33:36.718 --> 01:33:38.208
Lt'll be better
if we do this together.

01:33:38.287 --> 01:33:39.686
No.

01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:43.888
This is where
it started for me.

01:33:44.259 --> 01:33:46.124
This is where it ends.

01:33:59.274 --> 01:34:00.764
That's Landy.

01:34:07.082 --> 01:34:09.915
<i>Mandy Aaron,
dial extension 200, please.</i>

01:34:09.985 --> 01:34:12.579
<i>Mandy Aaron,
dial extension 200.</i>

01:34:13.188 --> 01:34:14.655
All right,
lock this building down.

01:34:14.723 --> 01:34:17.248
Set a secure perimeter
of one block.

01:34:23.565 --> 01:34:27.023
Hello. This is Pamela Landy.
I have to send
a classified document.

01:34:27.102 --> 01:34:28.933
Get a team to SRD
after Bourne.

01:34:29.004 --> 01:34:30.801
And put someone
in every public area
of this hospital.

01:34:30.873 --> 01:34:33.899
Okay. Elevator shafts,
service entrances, go!

01:34:39.214 --> 01:34:41.842
Damn it! South bay! Go!

01:34:42.351 --> 01:34:44.216
Gentlemen, this is
a priority one situation!

01:34:44.286 --> 01:34:45.685
You will give us
your full cooperation.

01:34:45.754 --> 01:34:47.915
Give me playback
for the entire building
for the last three minutes.

01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:49.014
Yes, sir.

01:35:00.802 --> 01:35:02.235
Move! Move!

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:10.003
This one, here!
Where is this?

01:35:10.078 --> 01:35:11.204
First floor.

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:13.373
I'll take Landy on my own.

01:35:48.717 --> 01:35:51.413
You better get yourself
a good lawyer.

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:08.599
<i>A republic lives
on the knife's edge.</i>

01:36:16.478 --> 01:36:20.471
<i>When we are finished
with you, you will
no longer be David Webb.</i>

01:36:22.918 --> 01:36:25.785
<i>You may not even
remember who he was.</i>

01:36:28.357 --> 01:36:31.383
<i>You know why
we're treating you
like this?</i>

01:36:33.095 --> 01:36:34.119
Hello, Jason.

01:36:37.332 --> 01:36:40.563
I believe you've been
having some problems.

01:36:40.636 --> 01:36:42.297
Put the gun down.

01:36:43.372 --> 01:36:46.341
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't want to talk.

01:36:49.578 --> 01:36:51.910
I've spent three years
running.

01:36:52.614 --> 01:36:55.811
Three years trying
to find out who I am.

01:36:55.884 --> 01:36:58.819
You've still not got it
all back, have you?

01:36:59.488 --> 01:37:01.820
Still not filled in
the pieces.

01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:03.551
It was always you.

01:37:05.627 --> 01:37:07.424
I'm unarmed, Jason.

01:37:07.929 --> 01:37:10.523
Why me? Why did you pick me?

01:37:11.833 --> 01:37:14.529
Your really don't remember,
do you?

01:37:16.838 --> 01:37:19.864
We didn't pick you.
You picked us.

01:37:22.978 --> 01:37:24.639
You volunteered.

01:37:26.548 --> 01:37:27.947
Right here.

01:37:30.986 --> 01:37:32.510
Even after you were warned.

01:37:42.597 --> 01:37:44.428
Captain Webb.

01:37:44.499 --> 01:37:45.796
Good morning, Captain.

01:37:51.339 --> 01:37:53.364
You came in here.

01:37:55.444 --> 01:37:58.277
You didn't even blink, Jason.

01:38:03.385 --> 01:38:05.444
You just handed me these.

01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.820
Has everything
been explained to you?

01:38:16.598 --> 01:38:17.929
Yes, sir.

01:38:20.535 --> 01:38:22.833
You said you wanted to serve.

01:38:24.539 --> 01:38:27.565
Your missions will save
American lives.

01:38:27.642 --> 01:38:29.507
I understand, sir.

01:38:32.147 --> 01:38:34.809
You said I'd be
saving American lives.

01:38:35.317 --> 01:38:37.012
You were.

01:38:37.085 --> 01:38:39.246
I was killing for you.

01:38:41.456 --> 01:38:42.889
For them.

01:38:43.759 --> 01:38:48.423
You knew exactly
what it meant for you
if you chose to stay.

01:38:48.697 --> 01:38:52.929
When we are finished
with you, you will
no longer be David Webb.

01:38:53.001 --> 01:38:55.231
I'll be whoever
you need me to be, sir.

01:38:57.139 --> 01:38:59.767
You can't outrun
what you did, Jason.

01:39:00.408 --> 01:39:03.002
You made yourself
into who you are.

01:39:03.845 --> 01:39:06.814
Eventually
you're gonna have to
face the fact

01:39:06.882 --> 01:39:11.478
you chose right here
to become Jason Bourne.

01:39:17.993 --> 01:39:20.461
You haven't slept
for a long time.

01:39:25.834 --> 01:39:27.927
Have you made a decision?

01:39:32.507 --> 01:39:34.202
This can't go on.

01:39:34.943 --> 01:39:36.740
You have to decide.

01:39:40.315 --> 01:39:41.646
Who is he?

01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:43.779
We've been through that.

01:39:47.322 --> 01:39:48.914
What did he do?

01:39:49.491 --> 01:39:51.322
It doesn't matter.

01:40:05.173 --> 01:40:07.164
You came to us.

01:40:09.845 --> 01:40:11.813
You volunteered.

01:40:12.647 --> 01:40:15.810
You said
you'd do anything
it takes to

01:40:16.484 --> 01:40:18.645
save American lives.

01:40:19.287 --> 01:40:21.414
You're not a liar,
are you?

01:40:22.457 --> 01:40:24.948
Or too weak

01:40:25.827 --> 01:40:27.658
to see this through?

01:40:29.331 --> 01:40:30.821
This is it.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.798
Let go of David Webb.

01:40:40.508 --> 01:40:44.205
Really give yourself
to this program.

01:41:09.504 --> 01:41:11.335
You're no longer

01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:13.807
David Webb.

01:41:15.176 --> 01:41:19.340
From now on,
you'll be known as
Jason Bourne.

01:41:21.082 --> 01:41:23.243
Welcome to the program.

01:41:36.431 --> 01:41:38.262
Do you remember now?

01:41:47.042 --> 01:41:48.532
I remember.

01:41:50.779 --> 01:41:52.679
I remember everything.

01:41:54.249 --> 01:41:56.410
I'm no longer Jason Bourne.

01:41:58.086 --> 01:42:00.350
So now
you're gonna kill me.

01:42:01.623 --> 01:42:02.783
No.

01:42:04.526 --> 01:42:08.656
You don't deserve the star
they'd give you
on the wall at Langley.

01:42:23.078 --> 01:42:25.137
<i>He's headed
for the roof!</i>

01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:12.521
Why didn't
you take the shot?

01:43:21.503 --> 01:43:24.631
Do you even know
why you're supposed
to kill me?

01:43:34.049 --> 01:43:35.448
Look at us.

01:43:38.453 --> 01:43:40.819
Look at what
they make you give.

01:44:31.973 --> 01:44:33.497
Good morning, senators.

01:44:33.575 --> 01:44:38.569
If I may, I'd like to
begin by making a statement
for the record.

01:44:41.349 --> 01:44:45.979
<i>The file indicates
that Ezra Kramer
authorized six illegal...</i>
