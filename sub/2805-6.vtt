PETER:
<i>Previously on</i> White Collar…

00:02.794 --> 00:04.254
NEAL: The <i>Mosconi Codex.</i>

00:04.338 --> 00:06.048
This is no ordinary book.

00:06.590 --> 00:07.925
-Neal.
-Hello, Rebecca.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.092
You two know each other?

00:09.176 --> 00:12.471
I swear I had my key card
when I left work.

00:12.554 --> 00:15.390
We figure out what's hidden in those pages
and get to it first.

00:15.474 --> 00:17.351
I'm the reason the thief got in.

00:17.434 --> 00:19.436
My hope was that
the owner would let us study

00:19.520 --> 00:21.230
and look at the codex, and now it's gone.

00:21.647 --> 00:25.275
PETER: David Siegel. Cause of death
was a gunshot wound to the sternum.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.362
And we are no closer
to figuring out who did this and why.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.155
Dr. Summers, I need your help.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.282
Just because a person
starts doing good things

00:32.366 --> 00:34.701
doesn't mean
he wants to stop doing bad things.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.746
NEAL: <i>I've been serving too many masters.</i>
<i>I'm through being everyone's puppet.</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:40.249
Which strings exactly
do you plan on cutting?

00:40.666 --> 00:41.667
All of them.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.205
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

01:20.289 --> 01:22.583
Even the chip in the cover works.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.251
How'd you pull that off?

01:24.334 --> 01:27.087
I don't make them. I just sell them.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.510
You son of a bitch.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.470
Freeze! Hands in the air.

01:35.554 --> 01:36.847
FBI! Don't move!

01:44.479 --> 01:45.689
He's all yours.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.026
-What?
-Don't "what" me.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.612
You know what.
I gave you specific instructions.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.488
"Sit down, make the deal, get arrested."

01:53.572 --> 01:54.740
Three out of three
not good enough for you?

01:54.823 --> 01:57.618
I don't remember mentioning anything
about follow-up questions

01:57.701 --> 02:00.162
or interrogating the suspect
before the arrest.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.997
Interrogating the suspect…
What are… What, the chip?

02:02.080 --> 02:04.166
-The chip.
-I was gathering information.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.502
-For you or for us?
-If I were up to something,

02:06.585 --> 02:08.337
you really think I'd do it
when you had ears on me?

02:08.420 --> 02:09.880
That's exactly when you'd do it.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.216
I have a feeling this is about
more than passports.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.426
Oh, it's about passports.
Also about the $2 million

02:14.510 --> 02:15.677
that went missing in the last case.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.638
Oh, Dr. Summers might have some
insight into its location.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.933
Dr. Summers had a tendency to take
bad guys who want to be good

02:21.016 --> 02:22.184
and turn them into worse guys.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.811
What exactly happened
during your therapy session?

02:27.439 --> 02:29.858
She encouraged me to be
the man I really am.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.196
I think Lucy told Charlie Brown that
and only charged him 5 cents.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.866
And what kind of man
might that be, exactly?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.743
We were gonna discuss that
at our next session.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.245
Now I have to wait 20 years.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.330
I think these belong to Jones.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.883
Hey, where'd you get all these?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.802
Confiscated in various busts
around the city.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.428
Most in the last few weeks.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.013
It's first-rate and identical.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.598
These were all made by the same person.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.017
-You're sure about that?
-Yeah, the eagle's eye.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.477
There's a tiny dot
in the center of this one

03:05.561 --> 03:07.396
and in the one I bought from Ivan.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.189
That dot is as good as a fingerprint.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.443
So we're looking at a fairly
large forgery operation.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.820
You think Ivan's the artist?

03:14.903 --> 03:16.780
No, he says he only
sells them, and I believe him.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.407
Anyone this good would take credit.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.201
Think this has something to do
with the uptick of crime in Little Odessa?

03:21.285 --> 03:23.161
PETER: I don't believe in coincidences.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.497
Ivan's parking tickets.

03:25.581 --> 03:28.792
Ten so far this year, and they're all
in the exact same spot.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.838
I want traffic surveillance video
for the past six months on that address.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.214
JONES: Already on it.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.136
-Really?
-Really.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.932
Same spot, day after day.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.642
-Right in front of the hydrant.
-PETER: Mmm-hmm.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.769
There's plenty of metered
parking down the street.

03:47.853 --> 03:48.979
Why risk another ticket?

03:49.062 --> 03:50.314
Doris Day parking.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.901
I'm sorry. Doris Day what?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.194
Spot right in front.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.780
The kind of parking Doris Day
miraculously finds in all her movies.

03:58.864 --> 03:59.948
I never knew you were a fan.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.158
Oh, I love 'em.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.035
Place looks abandoned.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.079
Yeah, not a bad spot
for a passport forgery operation.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.664
Let's get a warrant and check it out.

04:14.046 --> 04:17.925
The history of cryptography,
oddly cryptic.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.427
Any luck finding out
what type of code this is?

04:20.511 --> 04:23.972
Oh, I've ruled out transposition
and Caesar shifts.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.850
Oh, and Sudoku and Kenken.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.685
Well, in a happy accident,

04:28.769 --> 04:30.687
you may have proven
the Riemann Hypothesis.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.232
The only thing I've proven
is that we need help.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.817
I've studied every pattern, every symbol.

04:35.901 --> 04:39.279
I can only conclude
that it is of alien origin.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.906
I think you're right.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.659
Aha! Finally, you've come around.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.494
I think you're right. We need help.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.703
Oh.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.999
Well, I do know a monk in Berlin
who dabbles in quantum mechanics.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.793
You think Hagen's using monks?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.503
I think Hagen is using you.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.797
And me.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.091
The only chance we have
of getting a leg up on him

04:59.174 --> 05:01.760
is by deciphering the codex first.

05:01.844 --> 05:02.845
Until then…

05:02.928 --> 05:04.763
It's ticking clocks and phone calls.

05:04.847 --> 05:08.016

Honey, that is a world away
from actually doing it.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.189
You remember first time I was on the ice,
it was our second date.

11:29.481 --> 11:30.649
How could I forget?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.861
-You were supposed to teach me.
-Well, how could I?

11:33.944 --> 11:36.738
You were sprawled out
on the ice like Bambi

11:37.739 --> 11:39.241
and looking just as adorable.

11:39.575 --> 11:40.617
Good save.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.495
All right, this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna start with the basics.

11:43.579 --> 11:46.748
Then we're gonna move to Tonya Harding
and Nancy Kerrigan, hopefully by midnight.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.710
Uh-huh, and then one day,
I will finally teach you how to skate.

11:49.793 --> 11:52.296
No, you're gonna teach me
how to skate as soon as this case is over.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.716
How do I look?

11:56.341 --> 11:57.968
Like an FBI accountant.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.721
Agent Gruetzner's conservative attire

12:00.804 --> 12:05.475
is just an attempt to disguise
his subversive and bohemian proclivities.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.113
That sounds familiar.

Yeah, it's not the first time
the Suit's gotten under my skin.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.243
I just heard from the exigent supervisor.

12:23.327 --> 12:26.622
Looks like Sergei wants to meet at a
vodka bar tomorrow, and that's a problem.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.415
I need to be in Little Odessa
at the same time

12:28.498 --> 12:30.334
I promised Rebecca a meeting with you.

You say problem, I say opportunity.

You can slip away,
and big brother will be none the wiser.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.635
True. Do we have an office yet?

12:39.718 --> 12:40.844
Yeah, and it's not far.

12:40.928 --> 12:43.222
Dr. Gravich, my former chiropractor

12:43.305 --> 12:46.225
and hero to ambulance chasers everywhere

12:46.308 --> 12:49.853

from 1:00 until 2:00 every day.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.146
A chiropractor's office?

12:52.272 --> 12:56.485
With some posters and sundry
accoutrements, it'll look the part.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.113
And to keep her from asking too many
questions, we can show her the codex.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.865
She is a Mosconi expert.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.534
That's why she started
working at the museum.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.618
Until you got her fired.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.079
Maybe she'll forgive us if we give her
a little peek at our chapter.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.540
So you can reward her for your misdeed

13:09.623 --> 13:12.668

with her information.

are in a van a few blocks away.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.819
Any closer and I think it'd be too risky.

-Which is why I made these.

-Yes.

We did three of them.

-Ooh, three? Three.
-Yes.

to drink until the bottle is empty.

without insulting Sergei.

All I know is that he brings
terrible people to Little Odessa.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.089
Everyone is scared of him.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.842
Then why are you with him?

23:03.926 --> 23:05.928
In the beginning, he was a good man.

23:06.637 --> 23:08.472
I moved from Moscow to be with him.

23:09.932 --> 23:11.725
Now he treats me like possession.

23:13.769 --> 23:15.604
Last week, he thought I cheated on him.

23:18.565 --> 23:20.442
So he hit me.

23:21.109 --> 23:25.989
(SCOFFS) And the next day, like nothing
happened, he asks me to marry him.

I'm curious to know what you think.

24:14.705 --> 24:17.958
So Katya's had trouble
executing her salchow.

24:18.041 --> 24:21.378
In my opinion, the problem
is her center of gravity

24:21.461 --> 24:22.963
when she lands on the inside edge.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.756
Well, that would be a problem.

24:25.048 --> 24:28.260
The salchow always lands
on the outside edge.

24:28.886 --> 24:31.305
All she needs is a slight adjustment.

24:31.722 --> 24:35.309
The extension of her free foot
on the three spin

24:35.392 --> 24:36.727
tends to be a bit shallow.

24:38.312 --> 24:40.397
Okay. Work your magic.

35:12.321 --> 35:13.697
-on the Biellmann spin.
-(LAUGHS)

35:14.740 --> 35:17.326
Oh, you have no idea what
any of that means, do you?

35:17.409 --> 35:20.412
No. A commentator once
said it on my research DVDs.

35:20.495 --> 35:21.872
It sounded good.

35:23.790 --> 35:24.791
(SIGHS)

35:24.875 --> 35:26.210
-Thank you.
-(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

35:26.293 --> 35:27.419
Sure.

35:27.503 --> 35:28.504
Oh.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.714
Good luck.

35:32.341 --> 35:34.051
-I'll walk you out.
-Thank you.

35:35.260 --> 35:36.345
Bye.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.058
What'd you find?

35:41.141 --> 35:44.102
Surveillance cameras a block from
the vodka room led us to a cabbie.

35:44.186 --> 35:45.854
He picked them up and brought them here.

35:45.938 --> 35:47.356
Anything special about the place?

35:47.439 --> 35:49.024
No, it's just your average
office building.

35:49.107 --> 35:51.735
Accountants, therapists,
nothing out of the ordinary.

35:52.611 --> 35:54.363
Is there any reason
he'd slip away to come here?

35:54.988 --> 35:56.532
Neal always has a reason.

36:11.547 --> 36:13.215
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

36:13.298 --> 36:15.926
You can pull the ripcord
on your safety chute.

36:16.134 --> 36:18.554
Rebecca just called on the burner phone.

36:18.637 --> 36:20.180
Really? What did she say?

36:20.264 --> 36:22.558
Do I detect a lilt in your voice?

36:22.641 --> 36:25.227
Agent Gruetzner sees all. You like her.

36:25.310 --> 36:26.645
What is this, sixth grade?

36:26.728 --> 36:28.397
Personally, I don't see the attraction.

36:28.480 --> 36:32.317
She doesn't want to rob you or arrest you
or charge you with insurance fraud.

36:32.401 --> 36:34.361
Just tell me what she said.

36:34.653 --> 36:37.239
She wants to meet at the Rare Book Room.

36:37.781 --> 36:39.283
You know, there's
nothing more enchanting

36:39.366 --> 36:42.828
than a beautiful woman
cradling a classic opus

36:43.036 --> 36:45.038
in her soft, gentle hands.

36:45.747 --> 36:47.207
Would you like to take the lead
on this one?

36:47.291 --> 36:49.960
No, you're the front man.
I'm merely rhythm guitar.

36:50.043 --> 36:51.503
Yeah, well, so was John Lennon.

36:51.837 --> 36:53.046
Thank you for that.

36:54.173 --> 36:55.215
Hey.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.093
Leave your heart off your sleeve.

37:05.058 --> 37:06.602
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.

37:06.685 --> 37:10.772
Uh, just a routine call. We're checking
all the offices in the area.

37:11.481 --> 37:14.776
Anything unusual occur here
in the last couple days?

37:14.860 --> 37:17.529
Not unless you consider
a room full of herniated discs unusual.

37:17.613 --> 37:19.615
Hmm. Mind if I poke around?

37:19.698 --> 37:21.575
Honey, you go ahead and poke.

37:21.658 --> 37:22.868
(PHONE RINGING)

37:24.369 --> 37:25.996
Hello, Dr. Gravich's office.
How can I help you?

37:27.247 --> 37:29.082
Well, what seems to be the problem?

37:29.625 --> 37:31.001
Um…

37:31.084 --> 37:33.921
How's Thursday?
He's here from 10:00 a.m. till 5:00.

37:35.464 --> 37:36.590
Okay.

37:43.805 --> 37:44.806
Hmm.

38:18.757 --> 38:21.134
-You mind if I read over your shoulder?
-(CHUCKLES)

38:22.135 --> 38:24.429
It's not exactly light reading.

38:25.514 --> 38:27.516
-Oh, Mosconi.
-Yeah.

38:27.599 --> 38:30.644
I figured we could,
um, start our research.

38:31.895 --> 38:34.398
Does that mean you've come to a decision?

38:35.107 --> 38:36.567
Yes, it does.

38:37.651 --> 38:39.361
I will help you with the codex.

38:41.822 --> 38:42.948
Um…

38:43.031 --> 38:44.074
But…

38:44.157 --> 38:46.618
I should tell you something first,
just so you know.

38:46.702 --> 38:47.828
Tell me.

38:48.078 --> 38:49.329
I, uh…

38:50.497 --> 38:52.708
I did time.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.585
Really?

38:54.835 --> 38:56.336
-Wow.
-I was 19.

38:56.420 --> 38:59.464
It was a semester in Marrakech.

38:59.548 --> 39:05.429
So I'm in the Menara Gardens,
and there was this beautiful green tile.

39:05.512 --> 39:06.889
What, in the Saadian Pavilion?

39:08.348 --> 39:09.391
Yes.

39:09.725 --> 39:13.270
So it had fallen off the roof,
and I pocketed it.

39:13.353 --> 39:17.941
And I always meant to take it back,
and then when I tried…

39:18.025 --> 39:19.151
You got pinched.

39:20.194 --> 39:22.863
It was the scariest night of my life.

39:23.655 --> 39:25.574
Um, I'm sorry. "Night"?

39:25.657 --> 39:26.825
Singular?

39:26.909 --> 39:28.619
-Believe me…
-One night in jail?

39:28.702 --> 39:30.537
One night in a Moroccan prison is enough.

39:30.621 --> 39:32.581
All right.

39:35.042 --> 39:37.878
Look, we've worked with ex-cons before.

39:38.504 --> 39:41.632
Even seasoned,
hardened criminals, like yourself.

39:41.757 --> 39:43.008
Did you have a prison bitch?

39:43.091 --> 39:44.801
(LAUGHS)

39:45.260 --> 39:46.720
-PATRON: Shh!
-(CHUCKLES)

39:46.803 --> 39:48.055
Sorry.

39:50.432 --> 39:53.227
And, in the interest of full disclosure…

39:54.603 --> 39:56.980
Look, our copy of the codex is incomplete.

39:57.064 --> 39:58.315
Oh.

39:58.649 --> 39:59.691
How much do you have?

39:59.775 --> 40:02.945
A single chapter. It's chapter 13.

40:03.028 --> 40:05.072
-Does that mean anything to you?
-(SIGHS)

40:07.658 --> 40:09.201
-You know what?
-What?

40:09.284 --> 40:10.661
I'm done with games.

40:11.245 --> 40:13.121
Games? What are you talking about?

40:13.205 --> 40:14.665
Did I say… What did I say?

40:14.748 --> 40:17.334
Go ahead. Open it. Chapter 13.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.052
No luck? Try this one.

40:33.559 --> 40:36.979
Mosconi was incredibly superstitious.

40:37.062 --> 40:42.317
In all the books he ever produced,
he never wrote a chapter 13.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.203
That's it.

40:53.287 --> 40:54.746
You're getting your sea legs back.

40:54.830 --> 40:56.206
Frozen sea legs.

40:56.290 --> 40:57.374
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

40:57.457 --> 40:59.042
Is it really okay that we're doing this?

40:59.126 --> 41:02.212
Well, technically, it's a crime scene,
so don't touch anything.

41:02.296 --> 41:04.715
Okay. All right,
tell me how to turn again.

41:04.798 --> 41:07.676
Uh-oh. All right, just put pressure
on the outside blade.

41:07.759 --> 41:08.760
-Yes.
-And lean.

41:08.844 --> 41:10.512
Oh! Oh, like that!

41:10.596 --> 41:11.680
-There you go.
-Yeah!

41:11.763 --> 41:13.015
-Good.
-Whoa. Wait, wait! Whoa!

41:13.098 --> 41:14.183
I got you. I got you.

41:14.266 --> 41:15.475
-(GIGGLING)
-Whoa!

41:15.976 --> 41:17.644
-Okay.
-I got you.

41:17.728 --> 41:19.271
Yeah. You always do.

41:22.316 --> 41:23.400
Okay.

41:41.543 --> 41:43.504
PETER: Kind of like our second date.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.048
ELIZABETH: Little better.
