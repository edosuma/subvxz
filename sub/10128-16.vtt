AND VERY POSSIBLY THE LAST ONE
BEFORE WE'RE MARRIED.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.700
I WANT THIS VALENTINE'S DAY
TO SET THE STAGE

00:30.700 --> 00:32.300
FOR EVERY VALENTINE'S DAY
WE SHARE TOGETHER

00:32.300 --> 00:33.867

A BIG DEAL FOR ME,

00:49.967 --> 00:51.600
SO I'D RATHER
NOT TALK ABOUT IT, OK?

00:51.600 --> 00:53.500
BECAUSE YOU MISS ANGELA?

00:53.500 --> 00:57.133
BECAUSE I'M AT A PAY PHONE,
AND THERE ARE COWBOYS AROUND.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.734
WELL, I MISS YOU, BUDDY.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.600

GONNA SAY IT.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.300
YOU DON'T MISS ME?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.300
COME ON, LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.900

01:33.500 --> 01:36.100
SHAWN STILL ON HIS QUEST
FOR SELF-DISCOVERY?

01:36.100 --> 01:37.700
FORGET SHAWN. ENOUGH SHAWN
AND HIS SEARCH FOR HIMSELF

01:37.700 --> 01:39.867
AND IS HE GOING OUT
WITH ANGELA OR IS HE NOT?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.500
THIS VALENTINE'S DAY
IS ABOUT US, BABY.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.500

VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU, CORY.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.400

01:49.400 --> 01:52.200
HUH? YOU REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
LAST YEAR, RIGHT?

01:52.200 --> 01:54.000
OH, PLEASE, LET'S NOT
TALK ABOUT LAST YEAR.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.200
NO, NO, NO, LAST YEAR--
HERE WE GO.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.900
LAST YEAR, WE WERE--
I MEAN, YOU AND I WERE--

01:59.900 --> 02:01.834
I CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT.

02:01.834 --> 02:04.000
BROKEN UP BECAUSE
YOU KISSED ANOTHER GIRL?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.700
LIKE AN ELEPHANT,
THE MEMORY ON THIS ONE.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.100
YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

02:07.100 --> 02:08.767
YOU KISSED
THAT SOAP OPERA GUY.

02:08.767 --> 02:09.967
YOU MEAN, THE ARTIST?

02:09.967 --> 02:11.734
WHATEVER! THE POINT IS,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:11.734 --> 02:13.767
I MEAN, TODAY WAS THE DAY WE
WERE SUPPOSED TO TALK ABOUT

02:13.767 --> 02:16.100
OUR PLANS FOR VALENTINE'S
DAY. YOU KNEW THAT.

02:16.100 --> 02:18.100
MORGAN CALLED ME.
SHE NEEDED A RIDE
HOME FROM SCHOOL.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.500
MORGAN, WHY DID YOU CALL HER?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL MOM?

02:21.500 --> 02:23.400
YOU KNOW TODAY'S THE DAY
BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.200
YOU KNOW I AM TRYING
TO GET THE FOCUS BACK
ON CORY AND TOPANGA.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.867
MOM FORGOT
ABOUT ME AGAIN,

02:27.867 --> 02:29.467
JUST LIKE SHE FORGOT
TO BUY THE VALENTINES

02:29.467 --> 02:30.867
FOR ME TO HAND OUT
AT SCHOOL,

02:30.867 --> 02:33.100
WHICH IS WHY
BOBBY PORTERFIELD
THINKS I DON'T LIKE HIM,

02:33.100 --> 02:35.400
WHICH IS WHY HE DIDN'T
INVITE ME TO HIS PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.367
I'M VERY SAD ABOUT THIS.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.200
HEY.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.300
NO.
WHY DON'T WE
INVITE MORGAN

02:41.300 --> 02:43.500
NO. NO. NO!
TO SPEND
VALENTINE'S DAY WITH US?

02:43.500 --> 02:46.100
DO YOU WANT TO HEAR
WHAT MY ANSWER IS?

02:46.100 --> 02:48.600
NO! CORY, THIS PARTY WAS
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOUR SISTER.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.133
WITH THE NEW BABY COMING,
SHE'S FEELING VERY EXCLUDED.

02:51.133 --> 02:53.400
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
FEELS EXCLUDED? ME!

02:53.400 --> 02:54.600
THIS IS YOUR SISTER.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.000
THIS IS WHY I NEVER
ASKED HER OUT
ON A DATE.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.133
NOW, DOES
OUR FIRST ENGAGED
VALENTINE'S DAY

03:00.133 --> 03:01.200
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU
AT ALL?

03:01.200 --> 03:02.767
OF COURSE IT MEANS
SOMETHING TO ME, CORY,

03:02.767 --> 03:05.033
BUT SOMETIMES THINGS COME UP
THAT ARE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN YOU AND ME.

03:05.033 --> 03:08.600
OH, WHAT'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN YOU
AND ME EXCEPT ME?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.967
SOMETIMES
THINGS COME UP.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.000
I HATE
THAT THINGS COME UP.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.200
I HATE IT.
I HATE IT!

03:14.200 --> 03:17.033
DON'T LOOK AT ME
IF I REPULSE YOU.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.400
I NEVER SAID "REPULSED."

03:18.400 --> 03:21.400
YOU LAUGHED AT ME
WHEN I TRIED ON
THE ORANGE DRESS.

03:21.400 --> 03:24.500
YOU LOOKED LIKE
THE GREAT PUMPKIN,
CHARLIE BROWN.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.367
ERIC, YOUR MOTHER
IS ENORMOUS FOR A REASON.

03:27.367 --> 03:30.200
ENORMOUS?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.600
WELL, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

03:31.600 --> 03:34.000
I AM 7 1/2 MONTHS
PREGNANT. I WADDLE.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.967
I CAN HEAR MY THIGHS
RUB TOGETHER LIKE
A HUMAN CRICKET.

03:38.967 --> 03:42.734
EEW! MY MOMMY SAID,
"THIGHS RUB TOGETHER." EEW!

03:42.734 --> 03:44.200
DO YOU
STILL LOVE ME?

03:44.200 --> 03:45.734
NO.

JUST PAINT GOODYEAR

WHILE I'M
MAKING THE INCISION,

17:37.567 --> 17:40.033
EVEN THOUGH
I'D ADVISE YOU NOT TO.

17:43.500 --> 17:47.900
OH, THAT'S GOING TO BE
A TOUGH IMAGE TO GET RID OF.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.834
WHAT A GLORIOUS EXPERIENCE.

17:49.834 --> 17:53.934
YOU MUST BE VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE NEW BABY, MORGAN.

17:53.934 --> 17:56.000
I GUESS.

17:59.934 --> 18:01.800
SO WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO?

18:01.800 --> 18:03.467
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO?

18:03.467 --> 18:05.200
I MEAN, DO
YOU GUYS WANT ME
TO MOVE OUT OR--

18:05.200 --> 18:06.600
NO! NO, ERIC,
WE DON'T WANT THAT.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.000
THIS IS
REALLY NEW TO US,

18:08.000 --> 18:10.467
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
JACK AND I ARE READY
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

18:10.467 --> 18:12.200
YOU DO
LIVE TOGETHER.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.800
YEAH, BUT, ERIC,
WE DON'T WANT
ANYTHING TO CHANGE.

18:14.800 --> 18:17.600
NO, WE DON'T
WANT ANYTHING
TO CHANGE, ERIC.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.700
GUYS, YOU'RE
KIDDING YOURSELVES.
IT HAS CHANGED.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.467
IT WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME AGAIN.

18:24.767 --> 18:25.967
I'M GONNA MOVE OUT.

18:28.567 --> 18:31.300
ALL RIGHT, THE NURSE
IS GOING TO HELP PUSH

18:31.300 --> 18:33.300
AS I PULL THE BABY OUT.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.734
YOU MAY FEEL SOME MOVEMENT.
UH-HUH.

18:35.734 --> 18:38.400
IT SHOULD BE OVER
IN A MINUTE.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.400
[BABY CRIES]

18:39.400 --> 18:41.967
ALAN, CAN YOU SEE THE BABY?

18:41.967 --> 18:44.233
OH, MY GOD, HONEY.
IT'S A BOY!

18:44.233 --> 18:45.900
ANOTHER ONE?!

18:45.900 --> 18:47.734
[CRIES]

18:47.734 --> 18:49.900
OH, IT'S OK.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.233
OH, HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:52.233 --> 18:53.767
YOU WANT TO CUT
THE CORD, ALAN?

18:53.767 --> 18:54.767
YEAH.

18:54.767 --> 18:55.734
RIGHT HERE.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.233
AND NOW WE'LL
GIVE HIM A BATH

19:02.233 --> 19:04.734
AND RETURN HIM
TO HIS MOTHER.

19:04.734 --> 19:09.000
OH, HURRY UP.
I CAN'T WAIT TO HOLD HIM.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.934
OH, HE'S PERFECT.

19:11.934 --> 19:13.500
JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.133
ALL RIGHT, KIDDO,
BATH TIME.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.300
DOCTOR, HIS BREATHING
IS IRREGULAR.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.500
WHAT? NO, IT ISN'T.

19:20.500 --> 19:21.867
Dr. Taylor:
GET HIM TO I.C.U.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.567
WAIT, WAIT. THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH HIM.

19:23.567 --> 19:24.567
IS HE GOING TO BE OK?

19:24.567 --> 19:25.834
THIS IS
JUST A PRECAUTION.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.500
WELL, WHERE
ARE YOU TAKING HIM?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.500
NEONATAL I.C.U.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.700
YOU CAN FOLLOW
THE NURSE THERE.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.233
ALAN, INTENSIVE CARE?

19:33.400 --> 19:34.734
OH, HE'S--
HE'S GONNA BE OK.

19:34.734 --> 19:36.000
HE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.300
WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND
DECIDE ON A NAME, OK?

19:38.300 --> 19:41.734
ALAN, YOU BRING HIM
BACK TO ME.

19:44.133 --> 19:46.500
[SIGHS]

19:49.900 --> 19:51.400
[SIGHS]

19:51.400 --> 19:53.600
CORY,
YOU TRANSPARENT MORON,

19:53.600 --> 19:56.834
IF YOU SIGH ONE MORE TIME,
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO SIGH ABOUT.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.600
NOT FOR ONE MINUTE...

19:58.600 --> 20:00.934
ON THIS NATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED DAY OF LOVE,

20:00.934 --> 20:03.700
DID I NOT
THINK ABOUT YOU AND
WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.934
CORY, WE ARE HERE
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT REASON.
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

20:06.934 --> 20:08.900
BUT THERE ARE OTHER
THINGS IN THIS WORLD
MORE IMPORTANT THAN US.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.834
I DON'T BELIEVE IT,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHY
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED,

20:10.834 --> 20:12.867
BECAUSE
THERE IS NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT THAN US.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.200
UH...

20:18.200 --> 20:21.967
I ONLY GOT TO HOLD HIM
FOR A SECOND. UH...

20:21.967 --> 20:23.567
HE'S NOT BREATHING
ON HIS OWN.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.500
THEY GOT HIM
ON A RESPIRATOR.

20:25.500 --> 20:29.100
AND, UH...THEY, UH...

20:29.100 --> 20:33.867
THEY DON'T KNOW IF--
HE'S JUST SO SMALL, SO HELPLESS.

20:33.867 --> 20:38.000
UH...I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.767
I CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN
JOSHUA OR DANIEL.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.233
WHERE'S THE BABY?
