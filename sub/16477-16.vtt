WEBVTT

00:03.071 --> 00:04.605
Operation Willoughby is a go.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.574
McGEE:
Our target is Kai Chen.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.376
Wealthy businessman
suspected of committing

00:08.409 --> 00:11.312
acts of terror to manipulate
the stock market.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.314
McGEE:
Reeves was trained as a pilot

00:13.347 --> 00:14.715
to infiltrate Chen's operation.

00:14.748 --> 00:17.251
Get him out of there now.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.719
I volunteered for Willoughby.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.054
I know what
I signed up for.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.722
Let me see this
through to the end.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.757
NSA has a new recording
from last night,

00:23.791 --> 00:25.726
same two callers.
Get it to Qasim.

00:25.759 --> 00:28.196
Qasim, these conversations
you've been listening to,

00:28.229 --> 00:30.231
they're about a terrorist
we've been tracking for months.

00:32.666 --> 00:35.103
QUINN: Bishop, get your mind
off revenge.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.337
You need to stay out of it.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.072
If Gibbs finds out
you're working on this,

00:38.106 --> 00:39.207
and I'm helping you,

00:39.240 --> 00:40.408
he'll kill us both.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.144
I'm willing to take that chance.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.615
* Life is just a beach,
I'm playing in the sand *

00:47.648 --> 00:50.084
* Act like you know
who's in the room... *

00:50.118 --> 00:52.420
(exhales)

00:52.453 --> 00:56.257
* Spaceship fly
going to the moon... *

00:56.290 --> 00:57.758
(sighs)

00:57.791 --> 01:00.794
* Give me, give me all,
you gotta not hold back *

01:00.828 --> 01:03.464
* Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's mitt *

01:03.497 --> 01:06.267
* Killing competition like
just like that *

01:06.300 --> 01:09.603
* I don't really care
I just own what's mine *

01:09.637 --> 01:12.140
*

01:16.777 --> 01:19.780
DISTORTED VOICE:
Commander Turner.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.849
Aren't you going to say hello?

01:21.882 --> 01:24.152
Who is this?

01:24.185 --> 01:26.487
I think you know who it is.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.157
You let us down,
Commander Turner.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.259
That has consequences.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.694
(gasps)

01:34.828 --> 01:37.565
You should be very proud.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.200
Oh, God.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.770
She really is a beautiful child.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.272
Please.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.507
You didn't do
what you were told,

01:46.540 --> 01:48.576
and now you have
a choice to make.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.212
Kill yourself...

01:51.245 --> 01:52.480
or we kill your daughter.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.415
(crying): No.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.286
(crying)

02:02.723 --> 02:04.725
*

02:38.326 --> 02:40.294
Whoa, where's the fire?
Oh.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.796
Oh, sorry about that.
Sorry about that, McGee.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.366
Well?

02:45.399 --> 02:48.369
Oh, there is a fire
in my pocket.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.470
Oh.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.472
Uh, $32.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.907
We got a two-for-one coupon
to the Golden Corral.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.477
Ooh, I love those wings.
Hmm?

02:56.510 --> 02:59.980
And then we have a business card
to a sword swallower?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.782
Hmm?
That's weird.

03:01.815 --> 03:03.617
Hey, how'd you get my wallet?

03:03.651 --> 03:07.355
Oh, um, the same way
I got your watch... again.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.822
(whoops)

03:08.856 --> 03:11.959
Torres is giving us a lesson
in the art of pickpocketing.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.994
Thanks for being such a good
sport. Bishop?

03:14.027 --> 03:17.431
You're up--
Remember, bump, grab, slip.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.332
(whispers):
Bump, grab, slip.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.268
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.904
Oh.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.440
Ah! Well, she's
got the bump down.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.309
Really?
I am so sorry.

03:28.342 --> 03:29.843
Mm-hmm.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.313
TORRES: It's okay, it's
okay. Small casualty.

03:32.346 --> 03:33.614
It's all good.
Quinn?

03:33.647 --> 03:34.682
Hmm?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.916
Let's see what you got.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.418
You mean, other than...

03:37.451 --> 03:38.686
your badge?

03:38.719 --> 03:39.887
Ooh!
Ooh.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.690
The student becomes the master.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.957
Nice.
(chuckles)

03:50.798 --> 03:53.000
We need to talk. Chen.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.602
I found a translator
for the last message

03:54.635 --> 03:56.537
intercepted from Chen's people.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.771
What's it say?

03:57.805 --> 03:58.972
You tell me.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.509
Looks like it's just
a bunch of song lyrics.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.612
Must be another code.

04:04.645 --> 04:07.281
Maybe operational info
on Chen's next attack.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.549
When's Interpol
gonna make a move

04:08.582 --> 04:09.683
on the yacht he's staying on?

04:09.717 --> 04:11.485
They did. This morning.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.820
But he wasn't there.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.655
Always one step ahead.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.823
But they did get lucky

04:15.856 --> 04:18.025
reconstructing some
shredded documents.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.294
They picked up a trail
on some low-level courier

04:20.328 --> 04:21.962
Chen's people's
been using in D.C.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.364
I'll grab my SIG.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.832
Easy, Rambo.

04:24.865 --> 04:28.068
Look, Gibbs doesn't want you
anywhere near this case.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.504
And MI6 doesn't want me
sharing intel

04:30.538 --> 04:32.072
with anybody
who's not been read in.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.509
Did you forget the part
where Chen killed my boyfriend?

04:35.543 --> 04:39.447
That's why we're talking,
but, still, I go alone.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.014
If I need any backup,
I'll let you know.

04:42.550 --> 04:43.584
GIBBS:
Grab your gear.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.086
We got a body.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.722
Oh.
Sorry about that, Gibbs.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.458
Just a second. I'm
still missing a 20.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.859
Torres, cough it up.

04:51.892 --> 04:55.329
Hey, just making sure
you're paying attention.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.730
Wait, who's got my...

04:56.764 --> 04:59.433
Just making sure you're
paying attention.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.701
(laughs)

05:05.072 --> 05:06.774
(chuckles):
Oh...

05:09.443 --> 05:11.879
Our victim, Lieutenant
Commander RenÃ©e Turner.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.347
Uh, the neighbor
heard a gunshot.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.748
Called the cops.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.384
The wound looks self-inflicted.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.552
Well, if it is, it's
interesting timing.

05:18.586 --> 05:19.753
I just found plane tickets

05:19.787 --> 05:21.522
to Orlando,

05:21.555 --> 05:24.358
and a confirmation to
a Disney World hotel.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.494
Booked this morning.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.697
And there's fresh groceries in
the fridge and a couple of pies.

05:29.730 --> 05:33.100
Looks like Dutch apple
and pumpkin. Crisp.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.437
I skipped breakfast.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.972
She leave a note?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.441
Actually,
it's a popular misconception

05:40.474 --> 05:44.111
that most suicide
victims leave notes.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.046
In fact, only about a third

05:46.079 --> 05:47.781
leave them behind.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.719
Sometimes the lack of
a final message is for the best.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.655
I once attended
a crime scene

05:54.688 --> 05:56.457
where the note was so offensive,

05:56.490 --> 05:58.992
that the grieving wife,

05:59.026 --> 06:01.629
when she had
finished reading it,

06:01.662 --> 06:02.730
began to mutilate
her husband's body,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.698
starting with his...

06:04.732 --> 06:06.800
Okay, Duck.
I got it.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.136
We need to pick up the daughter.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.404
Social Services are

06:10.438 --> 06:12.005
on their way
to the school.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.775
Bishop, find out
where the husband's assigned.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.677
And somebody turn
that damn thing off.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.146
Uh, actually, Gibbs,
I just got

06:19.179 --> 06:20.781
a text from my landlord.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.016
My water heater exploded.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.518
Don't you mean burst?

06:24.552 --> 06:26.420
There's a difference?

06:26.454 --> 06:28.522
Yeah, a burst is a leak.

06:28.556 --> 06:31.859
Exploded means casualties.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.528
Eh, well, the "burst"
sounds pretty bad.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.530
Do you mind if I, you know...

06:38.198 --> 06:41.068
Thanks. Um, do you mind?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.070
Boss, I don't know what's going
on here, the TV won't turn off.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.505
I don't know what
the deal is.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.773
Maybe it's got
a short in it,

06:45.806 --> 06:47.074
or something's wrong
with the pi...

06:49.242 --> 06:50.644
It's off.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.982
(indistinct chatter)

06:55.015 --> 06:58.886
(trumpets playing)

07:04.257 --> 07:05.993
(sighs)
Subtle.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.761
Yeah. I was trying
to flash the lights.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.997
You mean get me canned?

07:10.030 --> 07:11.632
What's with the 911 text?

07:11.665 --> 07:13.634
I found Chen's courier.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.638
And so you jumped in your
Winnebago to come to tell me?

07:17.671 --> 07:20.774
No... I jumped in his.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.512
(grunting)

07:36.590 --> 07:38.191
McGEE: Lieutenant Commander
RenÃ©e Turner

07:38.225 --> 07:40.528
was assigned to the Defense
Logistics Agency.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.864
Her husband is stationed at our
naval base in Yokosuka, Japan.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.933
Has he been notified?
TORRES: Quinn's on it.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.668
In the meantime, the daughter's
gonna stay with her grandma.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.236
You check Turner's psych evals?

07:49.269 --> 07:51.071
Yes. No history
of depression,

07:51.104 --> 07:52.540
or anything that might indicate

07:52.573 --> 07:55.075
she's a suicide risk.
C.O.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.277
TORRES: He said Commander
Turner was stable, well-liked.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.246
Yeah. The only blip
on her record is this...

07:59.279 --> 08:01.248
Turner recently
made several large

08:01.281 --> 08:03.250
computer purchases
on behalf of the DLA,

08:03.283 --> 08:04.885
then cancelled the orders
at the last minute.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.820
How's that blippy?

08:06.854 --> 08:09.056
Well, she should've never placed
the orders in the first place.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.124
DLA was already overstocked
on that model.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.993
Yeah, but what does that mean?

08:13.026 --> 08:15.062
It means something.
Find out what.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.765
Okay, he definitely
means you, because, uh,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.800
computers are not my thing.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.069
I'll run it down with Bishop.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.871
Whenever she gets back.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.272
MAN:
I told you I have no idea.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.240
I don't have a clue
what Chen is up to.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.109
I make deliveries, that's it.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.911
If that were true,
Dabney,

08:30.944 --> 08:32.279
do you really think
I would've gone through

08:32.312 --> 08:34.014
all this trouble
of tracking you down?

08:34.047 --> 08:36.249
Well, I don't really know you.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.985
I'm a very efficient person.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.987
And a terrible driver.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.690
You were riding my brakes
the entire time.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.592
Well, maybe if you didn't drive
around in Walter White's lab.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.694
Hey. This is my house, buddy.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.062
And you know what? I've already
told you twice... shoes off.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.799
Okay, guys, let's focus.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.234
We know Chen
is planning an attack

08:54.267 --> 08:56.169
on the financial district.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.305
Well, then you know
more than me.

08:58.338 --> 09:00.808
Talk!
I can't help you.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.311
Hey!

09:04.344 --> 09:06.179
How about now?
Oh, come on, man!

09:06.213 --> 09:08.048
That's grape juice.
That's gonna stain.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.783
That's a nice rug.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.284
Bed, Bath & Beyond?

09:11.318 --> 09:13.721
That was my Nana's.
Oh.

09:13.754 --> 09:16.189
Chen. Talk.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.726
Okay. I might've overheard
some of his guys

09:18.759 --> 09:20.661
talking about some sort
of attack, maybe.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.596
On something electrical,
I think.

09:22.630 --> 09:23.864
The electrical grid?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.198
Could've been.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.233
Where's Chen?

09:32.372 --> 09:33.340
(gasps)
Hey.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.808
Oops.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.076
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.079
Look, I don't
have a clue

09:39.112 --> 09:40.313
where Chen is.
I've never even met the guy.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.682
I mean, his people call me,

09:41.715 --> 09:43.116
I do what they say, that's it.

09:44.317 --> 09:46.319
There's nothing else
I can tell you.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.892
What do you think?
I believe him.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.694
Good, because we're
out of juice.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.228
I looked at his
navigation system.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.797
There's a record
of all the places

09:56.830 --> 09:58.065
he's been to in
the last week.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.332
Something might
connect to Chen.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.635
REEVES:
Okay. I'll check it out.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.937
You should head back
to NCIS.
No way.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.639
I'm coming with you.
Gibbs ordered you
to stand down.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.040
I'm not afraid of Gibbs.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.710
Well, actually,
I'm a little bit afraid of him.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.111
And Qasim wouldn't want you

10:11.144 --> 10:12.980
putting yourself
at risk like this.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.116
Well, Qasim wasn't
exactly someone

10:16.149 --> 10:18.385
I would go to for
tactical advice.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.722
QASIM:
So plan is you hang out
by the bar.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.724
And then when they start
dividing up the teams,

10:23.757 --> 10:25.993
we'll accidentally
bump into each other.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.663
Act surprised, and then
I'll add you as my fourth.

10:29.697 --> 10:32.733
Just don't mention that you were
all-state six years in a row.

10:32.766 --> 10:35.368
Just one problem.

10:35.402 --> 10:38.405
The NCIS Bowl-Off
ended an hour ago.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.873
Hi, I'm...
Hi.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.941
Pete.
Leaving.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.042
I'm not.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.746
Right. Well.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.214
It was nice meeting
you, whoever you are.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.415
(chuckles)

10:52.385 --> 10:54.254
So.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.925
Do you bowl?

10:57.958 --> 10:59.192
(laughs)

10:59.226 --> 11:00.360
(they both laugh)

11:02.462 --> 11:04.097
That was quick.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.767
Did they have Orange
Julius, Dr. Palmer?

11:06.800 --> 11:07.901
Not Palmer.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.102
So my wait continues.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.470
What do you got?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.106
Well, so far, only this
toxicology report.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.309
Everything clear,
except for one anomaly.

11:16.343 --> 11:20.047
Commander Turner had
unusually high levels

11:20.080 --> 11:22.783
of oxytocin in her bloodstream.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.052
Has more in common
with a lactating mother

11:25.085 --> 11:27.788
or a love-sick teen.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.823
Not really seeing
a connection there, Duck.

11:29.857 --> 11:34.094
Oxytocin is often referred to
as "the cuddle hormone"

11:34.127 --> 11:38.365
because it's largely responsible
for our feelings of affection.

11:38.398 --> 11:42.102
For someone in the midst of
a suicide to experience, well,

11:42.135 --> 11:46.206
emotions that would cause
that hormone to spike,

11:46.239 --> 11:47.875
Well, it's very odd.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.142
Add it to the list.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.944
Well, unfortunately,

11:50.978 --> 11:53.346
we'll never know what
she was really thinking.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.182
Actually, I think we might.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.786
Abby ran a diagnostic
on Commander Turner's smart TV.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.188
Reason it wouldn't power off
is 'cause it was just hacked.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.923
It was hacked? How?

12:02.956 --> 12:05.759
Someone with an external
I.P. address

12:05.793 --> 12:08.528
ran a video stream
directly into the house.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.965
This is what we were able to
retrieve from the TV's cache.

12:11.999 --> 12:14.334
DISTORTED VOICE: You didn't do
what you were told.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.336
And now have a choice to make.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.538
Kill yourself

12:18.571 --> 12:21.975
or we kill your daughter.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.811
Well that would explain
the spike

12:23.844 --> 12:25.813
in Turner's oxytocin level.

12:25.846 --> 12:29.983
Her suicide was not the act
of a depressive individual.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.218
It was an act of love.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.087
A Sophie's Choice.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.457
DISTORTED VOICE: You didn't do
what you were told.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.992
Wonder what she was told to do.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.193
And by whom?

12:40.227 --> 12:41.528
Good question.

12:41.561 --> 12:44.031
I can't wait for you
to figure it out and tell me.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.098
What do you got, Abbs?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.433
Uh, sorry, Boss.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.868
Well, I was trying to backtrace

12:47.901 --> 12:49.036
the hacker's I.P. address,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.338
uh, but it was offline.

12:51.371 --> 12:52.973
Until two minutes ago.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.074
It just went live.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.142
You got a location?

12:55.175 --> 12:58.211
You got a doubt?

13:04.918 --> 13:08.555
McGee says the I.P. address
is still active.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.290
Someone's in there.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.592
I can't get decent Internet
in my apartment,

13:12.625 --> 13:15.062
and this guy's online?

13:19.366 --> 13:20.934
Quinn.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.441
Looks like someone
just logged off.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.943
We missed him.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.044
(nearby blipping)

13:31.078 --> 13:32.579
Or not.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.089
Freeze!
NCIS!

13:47.094 --> 13:48.328
Hi, Gibbs.

13:48.361 --> 13:52.065
Bishop. How's that
water leak coming?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.575
Agent Bishop,
you were specifically told

14:02.609 --> 14:04.511
to stay away from the Chen case.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.180
Yes, but...
And you,
Officer Reeves,

14:07.214 --> 14:09.282
I don't know where to start,
but it'll probably be

14:09.316 --> 14:11.084
with us reevaluating
your relationship here.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.420
I take full responsibility,
Director, but please know

14:13.453 --> 14:15.255
this wasn't
Agent Bishop's fault...

14:15.288 --> 14:16.356
Save it!

14:16.389 --> 14:17.657
Gibbs can handle her.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.326
Right now,
cards on the table.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.594
I need to know what you know,
and I mean everything.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.364
We translated the last message

14:24.397 --> 14:26.433
that NSA intercepted
from Chen's people.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.901
REEVES: Well,
it's just a bunch

14:27.935 --> 14:29.002
of random song lyrics.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.270
Some kind of code?

14:30.303 --> 14:32.439
The kind we can't crack. Yet.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.042
And the courier you picked up?
He told us

14:35.075 --> 14:37.444
he made a delivery on Chen's
behalf to that radio tower.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.312
That's the same place
where that video

14:39.346 --> 14:40.981
to Commander Turner was from.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.382
Well, it can't be a coincidence.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.384
Chen must be involved
in Turner's death.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.053
The attack
on the electrical grid,

14:46.086 --> 14:47.654
how confident was the courier?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.489
Well, he just heard whispers.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.959
Chen keeps his people
highly compartmentalized.

14:51.992 --> 14:55.595
And that kid was a few fries
short of a Happy Meal anyway.

14:55.628 --> 14:58.298
Well, he doesn't think much
of you, either.
What's this?

14:58.331 --> 15:01.201
That's the bill
for shampooing his carpeting.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.637
VANCE:
How'd the interrogation go?
Page two.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.107
He gave up the name of the guy
who owns the radio tower.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.442
Well, we need to pick him up.
He might know what Chen's up to.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.079
Yes, we do, Agent Bishop,
but we're not done here.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.514
I still need to have that chat
with Officer Reeves.

15:14.547 --> 15:18.218
Actually, we can do it
on the way to my 2:30.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.288
Why don't you grab these boxes,
follow me out to my car.

15:33.166 --> 15:36.003
I have absolutely no idea what
you could have been thinking.

15:36.036 --> 15:37.670
I can't stand
the sidelines, Gibbs.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.639
You can't, or you won't?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.408
Does it make a difference?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.677
I need people I can trust
to follow orders.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.346
No, you need people who care.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.982
And right now I care more than
anyone else in this building.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.084
Bishop, taking down Chen...

15:52.452 --> 15:55.622
...it's not gonna bring
your boyfriend back.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.328
Qasim wasn't just
my boyfriend, Gibbs.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.201
(groans softly)

16:08.235 --> 16:10.470
(sighs)

16:11.738 --> 16:14.074
* I don't know why I came

16:14.107 --> 16:16.309
* Guess I'm searching
for something *

16:16.343 --> 16:17.444
* And when your eyes
caught mine... *

16:17.477 --> 16:18.711
Mm, yuck!

16:18.745 --> 16:20.647
Hey.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.082
* Away from all these feelings

16:22.115 --> 16:23.450
* Emotions got me stumbling...

16:23.483 --> 16:25.452
(doorbell rings)

16:25.485 --> 16:28.288
* 'Cause I think
we started something. *

16:33.393 --> 16:35.195
Am I late?
Early.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.397
Again?
Mm-hmm. But it's
your birthday,

16:37.430 --> 16:39.766
so you can do
whatever you want.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.735
Oh. My God.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.337
Except that.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.472
I'm so sorry.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.739
Ah...

16:46.773 --> 16:49.242
(chuckles)
Forget about it.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.777
I'm sure I'll make it back

16:50.810 --> 16:54.247
to that village in Djibouti
again... one day.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.482
(sneezes)

16:55.515 --> 16:57.550
Oh. You feeling okay?

16:57.584 --> 16:59.552
Yeah. My...

16:59.586 --> 17:02.189
allergies just kicked
in for some reason.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.092
I got a new perfume.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.093
(sneezes)

17:06.126 --> 17:07.427
I'm gonna wash it off.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.629
No. Don't.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.531
(sneezes)
I like it. It...

17:11.564 --> 17:12.632
(sneezes)

17:12.665 --> 17:14.501
You want me to get
Nasonex?

17:14.534 --> 17:15.702
(exhales)

17:15.735 --> 17:18.138
This isn't how
I imagined this.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.107
Imagined what?

17:24.477 --> 17:25.678
(sneezes)

17:27.247 --> 17:29.616
His name is Kevin Lane.
He purchased the abandoned

17:29.649 --> 17:32.685
radio tower last
year on eBay.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.754
Oh, I actually think
I bid on that.

17:34.787 --> 17:36.356
What really impresses me

17:36.389 --> 17:38.558
is I have no idea
if you're joking or not.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.360
LANE: Sorry, boys,
I don't know who that is.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.729
TORRES:
Was.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.832
She killed herself, after
receiving a threatening message.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.767
From your compound.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.836
I don't have a clue
what you're talking about.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.238
So you're clueless.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.772
No, I'm a carpet
salesman.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.308
With enough emergency supplies
for World War III.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.843
No, just enough to survive.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.811
What, a zombie apocalypse?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.413
(chuckles):
The end of the world, man.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.681
It's coming sooner
than you think.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.183
Oh, you're one of those.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.185
If you mean one of
the smart ones, yeah.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.520
Between top soil depletion, the
fish hatcheries collapsing...

18:07.554 --> 18:08.688
Okay, we get it, man.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.457
...rogue nukes,
rogue comets,

18:10.490 --> 18:12.392
antibiotic-resistant
infections...

18:12.425 --> 18:14.461
Oh, wait,
I've heard of that one.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.828
Kai Chen.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.698
Why is he getting deliveries
to your compound?

18:18.731 --> 18:20.867
(scoffs)
Name doesn't ring a bell.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.673
Oh, you mean Bobby.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.708
Probably because he's one
of my business partners.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.677
A silent one.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.645
I'm guessing his real name
isn't Bobby?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.449
Keep talking.

18:36.483 --> 18:39.486
Look, about a year ago,

18:39.519 --> 18:41.721
some people in the Yahoo
Preppers Forum that I moderate

18:41.754 --> 18:43.856
pooled our resources
and bought a piece of land

18:43.890 --> 18:45.725
that we could hole up in.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.360
Then we were outbid
on an old missile silo,

18:47.394 --> 18:49.829
but we got the radio tower
for $20,000.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.731
With a working generator.
(chuckles)

18:51.764 --> 18:53.300
Bobby threw in ten.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.703
Am I the only one
uncomfortable with Chen

18:56.736 --> 18:59.306
investing in a, uh,
doomsday compound?

18:59.339 --> 19:01.208
Maybe the attack
he's planning

19:01.241 --> 19:03.643
on the electrical grid is
bigger than we thought.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.278
Hey, does Gibbs know
you're in here?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.314
He knows.
We worked it out.

19:07.347 --> 19:09.549
GIBBS: How do you contact him?
I don't.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.883
I mean, if you think
I'm paranoid,

19:10.917 --> 19:12.685
you should see this guy.
I've only seen him once,

19:12.719 --> 19:14.854
and that's when he came
to inspect the land.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.190
He works mostly through
encrypted chats,

19:17.224 --> 19:18.491
third-party middlemen.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.826
Any names?

19:19.859 --> 19:21.461
No.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.530
You know, but...

19:23.563 --> 19:25.965
about a month ago I was working
down in the bomb shelter,

19:25.998 --> 19:28.868
and some of his
delivery guys showed up.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.570
They had no idea I was there.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.205
Overheard them say something

19:32.239 --> 19:34.841
about, um... flying
back into town this weekend.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.445
WOMAN:
My REACT teams are in position

19:38.478 --> 19:40.580
at every airport that fits
your source's description.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.515
Chen is the target.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.950
All other considerations
extraneous.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.952
And when we get eyes on him?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.420
Arrest him.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.222
Belay that order.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.290
Says who?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.492
Says the ranking member
of the House Subcommittee

19:52.525 --> 19:53.960
on Counterterrorism.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.495
I want to talk to him.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.531
Her. She's standing
right in front of you.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.867
Oh.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.269
TORRES (clears throat):
The-the...

20:02.302 --> 20:04.471
the time, this
thing I have...

20:04.504 --> 20:05.472
Since when?

20:05.505 --> 20:06.739
Since yesterday.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.676
I was gonna tell you tonight.
Tonight?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.778
But when I heard about
your op, I came right over.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.480
I've been tasked
with supervising

20:13.513 --> 20:15.315
any activities
involving Chen.

20:15.348 --> 20:17.784
Supervising or sabotaging?

20:17.817 --> 20:19.886
Agent Gibbs, I agree,
we need to find Chen

20:19.919 --> 20:21.454
and put the screws to him.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.955
That's exactly
what we're doing.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.591
But our lawyers insist

20:24.624 --> 20:27.394
we don't have enough evidence
to arrest him, Lee.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.663
The body in our autopsy
would say otherwise...

20:30.697 --> 20:31.598
Lee.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.334
I have read your report
on Commander Turner,

20:34.367 --> 20:36.669
and any evidence connecting Chen
to her death

20:36.703 --> 20:38.571
is circumstantial at best.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.273
We have reason to believe
that Chen

20:40.307 --> 20:41.641
is planning a terrorist attack.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.042
We've suspected that for months.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.379
But if you arrest him now,
without sufficient evidence,

20:46.413 --> 20:48.648
he'll be back on the street
in two hours.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.384
And make sure
we can never find him again.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.285
Right.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.457
Agent Andrews, your order is

20:57.490 --> 20:59.359
to surveil Chen,
but do not engage.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.463
Agent Gibbs,
understand?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.965
Hard not to,

21:05.998 --> 21:08.501
with you two finishing
each other's sentences.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.471
(door opens)

21:11.504 --> 21:12.605
(door closes)

21:12.639 --> 21:14.507
(door slams)

21:19.379 --> 21:20.747
Hey. What's going on, Gibbs?

21:20.780 --> 21:23.316
No compression. Rebuilding.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.452
I mean with Chen.
McGee just briefed me

21:25.485 --> 21:27.687
on the congresswoman's
stand-down order?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.989
No. Not standing down.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.825
Well, the REACT teams
aren't allowed to arrest him,

21:32.859 --> 21:35.094
so what are they gonna do,
throw him a tea party?

21:35.127 --> 21:38.865
Get close enough
to access his laptop remotely.

21:38.898 --> 21:40.867
That plan didn't work out
so well last time,

21:40.900 --> 21:42.902
and it almost got Reeves killed.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.604
Well, we're just gonna have
to be a little more careful.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.906
I don't understand this.
After everything Chen has done,

21:46.939 --> 21:48.875
after everything we think
he might do,

21:48.908 --> 21:51.444
how can you just stand there?

21:53.012 --> 21:55.448
You aren't just standing there.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.049
No.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.652
You know something's off.
Yes.

21:59.686 --> 22:00.987
And you've got a plan.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.422
Working on it.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.690
(chuckles)

22:03.723 --> 22:06.526
I'm glad you came by.
I kind of hit a wall.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.861
All right, well,
what do you got so far?

22:08.895 --> 22:11.864
I'm thinking that we
arrest Chen anyway.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.801
Better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.103
That works for me.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.972
But I'm not holding my breath.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.941
We still have to find Chen.

22:21.974 --> 22:23.976
And when it comes
to airports,

22:24.010 --> 22:25.812
he's always been one step ahead.

22:25.845 --> 22:28.615
(door creaks open)

22:28.648 --> 22:30.617
You come alone?

22:30.650 --> 22:32.485
Yeah.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.469
Chen?

22:49.502 --> 22:51.671
Hello, Agent Bishop.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.573
Agent Gibbs.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.477
I heard you wanted to see me.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.156
Are you going to put

23:10.189 --> 23:11.991
those down so we can talk?

23:12.024 --> 23:13.125
Bishop.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.529
Hands on the table.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.798
Legs apart.

23:18.831 --> 23:22.569
I assure you I am not armed.

23:22.602 --> 23:23.803
(grunts, chuckles)

23:24.837 --> 23:27.139
Did Qasim like it rough, too?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.608
(grunts)

23:28.641 --> 23:29.942
(laughs)

23:32.579 --> 23:33.680
Talk.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.682
I told you.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.216
I heard you wanted
to see me.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.785
You heard from who?

23:38.818 --> 23:40.787
Little birdie
who works at an airport.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.723
That apparently is crawling
with NCIS agents.

23:43.756 --> 23:47.159
Well, that's what happens
when you kill one of us.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.629
(chuckles)
I have not killed anyone.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.198
Commander Turner
would disagree with that.

23:52.231 --> 23:55.034
We know about your attack
on the electrical grid.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.669
Sounds scary.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.505
Have any suspects?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.139
Why are you in my house?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.041
Why do you think?

24:02.074 --> 24:03.876
You want us to arrest you?

24:03.910 --> 24:06.513
You cannot arrest me.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.047
Yeah? You know,
I keep hearing that.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.949
Why don't we see what happens.
Bishop.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.787
(grunts)

24:14.821 --> 24:17.056
Better to ask forgiveness
than permission.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.158
You will get neither,
Agent Bishop.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.893
I am not the enemy.

24:20.927 --> 24:22.194
Well, that is
news to me.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.664
Then apparently
you have not heard.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.033
Heard what?

24:27.066 --> 24:29.836
We are on the same team now.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.509
When were you
gonna tell me?!

24:36.543 --> 24:38.545
Tell you what?

24:38.578 --> 24:39.512
Chen.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.913
How long have you known

24:40.947 --> 24:42.782
that Chen was working
with the CIA?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.250
He didn't.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.219
I found a corkscrew down
in the break room.

24:47.253 --> 24:49.155
The pinot can wait.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.858
What the hell is my agent
talking about, Jenna?

24:51.891 --> 24:53.593
Good question. What are you
talking about, Agent Gibbs?

24:53.626 --> 24:55.595
Chen.
He came to my house.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.930
He told me that he's
working with the CIA now.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.668
Even has you and SecDef
on his direct dial.

25:01.701 --> 25:04.270
You heard what the man said.
Start talking.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.938
You're not authorized.

25:05.972 --> 25:09.742
Would you like to take
that steak au poivre to go?

25:09.776 --> 25:12.011
Chen came to us with an offer.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.080
We finalized the deal today.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.983
There is a Syrian warlord
we've been trying to locate,

25:17.016 --> 25:19.986
one that Chen has done
business with in the past.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.954
Chen has agreed
to help us find him.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.990
All of a sudden
he's our best bud?

25:24.023 --> 25:28.227
Sometimes the enemy of my enemy
is my friend, Agent Gibbs.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.962
Jenna, Chen is
a suspected terrorist.

25:29.996 --> 25:32.832
He tried to kill two of
our people. He succeeded once.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.333
And he killed Commander Turner.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.803
And the warlord
that Chen is helping us find

25:36.836 --> 25:39.138
has been financing ISIS cells.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.675
They're attacking NATO troops.
Soldiers are dying, Lee.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.344
We need his help.

25:45.377 --> 25:49.682
And before either of you ruin
what's left of our dinner,

25:49.716 --> 25:50.817
I get it.

25:50.850 --> 25:52.719
We're not gonna let Chen walk.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.622
But we're gonna hit the pause
button on the investigation.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.356
Until you get what you what.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.593
What we all want,
Agent Gibbs.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.128
Until we have
actionable intelligence...

26:02.161 --> 26:04.731
Yeah. Pause button.

26:05.932 --> 26:09.035
Got it. I'm not hungry.

26:11.671 --> 26:13.773
(whirring)

26:22.348 --> 26:25.051
Uh... you got my message.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.385
Yeah. All ten of them.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.920
I see you're taking it out

26:27.954 --> 26:29.321
on the dust mites.
What are we gonna do?

26:29.355 --> 26:31.123
We can't just let Chen get away.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.892
That's exactly what we've been
ordered to do.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.194
Yeah, well, that congresswoman
can take her pause button

26:35.227 --> 26:37.930
and shove it up her ass.
Gibbs has just
let you back in.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.066
You fall out of line now
and you're done.

26:40.099 --> 26:43.135
Besides...
What?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.204
I think that congresswoman
has made the right call.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.708
That Syrian warlord is
destabilizing an entire region.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.810
That warlord's name
is Asu Harari,

26:50.843 --> 26:52.712
and he's a two-bit player
in Aleppo.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.347
I monitored his communications
when I was at the NSA.

26:55.381 --> 26:57.349
I-I know his entire network.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.251
This is a bad call.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.689
We have a coded message
from Chen

27:02.722 --> 27:04.156
on a suspected terrorist attack.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.026
And we can't arrest him
because he's the CIA's lapdog?

27:07.059 --> 27:08.695
That-that is nuts.

27:08.728 --> 27:10.730
Okay, well, you say you know
this Harari guy.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.364
Why don't we find him ourselves.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.833
Then the CIA
won't need Chen.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.702
That could take months.
So?

27:15.735 --> 27:18.705
I spent months taking pilot
lessons just to take Chen down.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.306
Clay, I-I can't eat,
I can't sleep,

27:20.339 --> 27:22.174
and I sure as hell
am not slowing down

27:22.208 --> 27:24.010
until Chen is off the street.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.245
Look, I hear you. I do.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.115
But this is a marathon, Ellie--
it's not a sprint.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.783
If you aren't willing
to make the sacrifices

27:30.817 --> 27:33.185
and commit to
the long haul,

27:33.219 --> 27:35.688
maybe you shouldn't be
running this race.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.859
You really caught me
off guard tonight.

27:39.892 --> 27:42.128
Especially
with the bowling alley.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.996
This is where we had
our first date.

27:44.030 --> 27:46.232
I wanted to bring you here
to celebrate.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.300
*

27:48.334 --> 27:51.170
(sighs)
What's the problem, Ellie?

27:58.077 --> 28:01.080
What do you want from me?

28:03.816 --> 28:06.786
I want you to stop being afraid.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.921
I want you to admit
that you can't breathe

28:08.955 --> 28:11.724
when you're
not with me.

28:11.758 --> 28:14.393
And most of all...

28:14.426 --> 28:16.395
I want you.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.798
You have me, Qasim.

28:18.831 --> 28:23.936
I-I spend 65%
of my free time with you.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.805
We have gone on 104 dates.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.373
We've...
You're proving my point.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.075
This is what you do, Ellie.

28:29.108 --> 28:32.078
You hide your feelings
behind that brain of yours.

28:32.111 --> 28:34.947
Behind statistics, metrics...

28:34.981 --> 28:36.949
Well, all of those things
are true.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.819
But not relevant.

28:39.852 --> 28:44.356
The world isn't all zeros
and ones.

28:46.392 --> 28:51.397
You can't reduce love
to a binary code.

28:53.465 --> 28:54.934
That's it.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.168
What's it?

28:56.202 --> 28:57.937
Qasim was trying to tell me

28:57.970 --> 29:01.207
that the world isn't reducible
to zeros and ones.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.475
But I got bratty
and I argued with him.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.812
I pointed out
that the crappy music playing

29:05.845 --> 29:08.815
at the bowling alley
was all zeros and ones.

29:08.848 --> 29:11.951
I'm sorry,
I flunked nerd in school.

29:11.984 --> 29:13.252
Chen's code.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.822
I think I know how to crack it.

29:15.855 --> 29:18.324
There are two general ways
to hide information.

29:18.357 --> 29:19.959
One is security
through math.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.062
Which is just your basic,
everyday encryption.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.465
BISHOP: The second is
security through obscurity.

29:26.498 --> 29:30.236
Which is where the data is not
encrypted-- it's just hidden.

29:30.269 --> 29:33.372
Like if you secretly put a
key underneath your doormat.

29:33.405 --> 29:36.142
Once you know the secret,
then it's easy

29:36.175 --> 29:37.243
to unlock the door.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.845
You figured out Chen's secret?

29:38.878 --> 29:40.146
Abby.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.215
Chen's message appeared to be

29:43.249 --> 29:45.084
random snippets
of song lyrics.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.518
But when you convert
those snippets

29:46.552 --> 29:49.221
to binary,
aka zeros and ones,

29:49.255 --> 29:51.858
the result is
an executable file.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.392
A what?

29:53.425 --> 29:54.560
Oh, you're cute.

29:54.593 --> 29:56.395
A computer program,
Gibbs.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.565
The song lyrics were
a computer program.

29:59.598 --> 30:00.900
Actually, it's a computer virus.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.301
That does what?

30:02.334 --> 30:04.303
Exploits the vulnerability
of diesel generators

30:04.336 --> 30:06.372
in older electrical plants.
Look at this.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.276
Now, DoD tested its weakness
a couple years ago.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.244
Congresswoman sent over
a tape of this.

30:12.278 --> 30:14.046
She's on her way over now
with the full file.

30:14.080 --> 30:15.882
"Aurora Vulnerability."

30:15.915 --> 30:17.149
That's a pretty name.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.018
Once infected,
the virus turns the generators

30:19.051 --> 30:21.420
on and off so quickly
they basically...

30:23.322 --> 30:25.257
Whoa, okay,
that was not pretty.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.293
This must be how Chen
is planning on taking out

30:27.326 --> 30:28.460
the electrical grid.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.130
Okay. Let's go.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.598
Thanks, Abbs.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.437
Bishop?

30:39.972 --> 30:40.940
What are you doing?

30:40.973 --> 30:43.142
The cavalry went that way.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.311
Uh, I was just gonna take
the stairs.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.880
I forgot something in my car.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.192
No, any power plant

31:00.226 --> 31:02.494
with a pre-2K diesel
generator is at risk.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.530
Do we know how Chen's planning
to disseminate the virus?

31:04.563 --> 31:07.066
Originally, Commander Turner.

31:07.099 --> 31:10.202
Well, Chen was
blackmailing her

31:10.236 --> 31:13.205
into buying these infected
computers for the DLA.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.575
Once they rotated into
the DoD's system,

31:16.608 --> 31:18.044
the virus would be in the wild.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.378
But she wouldn't play ball.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.080
She died for it.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.482
So what's Chen's Plan B?
Working on it.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.251
So right now,
we're just sitting ducks.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.653
Not necessarily. We've got
the virus's source code.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.655
I could always make an
anti-virus out of it.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.924
How long?
A few hours.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.659
Too long.
Go, get it done.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.364
So much for your pause button.

31:38.397 --> 31:40.366
We made a calculated bet.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.101
Yeah? Well, you bet wrong.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.303
And your Agent
Bishop was right.

31:44.336 --> 31:45.938
I have arranged
a video conference

31:45.972 --> 31:47.106
with the Joint
Chiefs in MTAC.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.307
I'd like her
to brief them.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.043
When's she back?

31:51.077 --> 31:52.979
Where did she go?

31:53.012 --> 31:54.981
I just bumped into her
in the parking lot.

31:55.014 --> 31:57.483
Torres.
Calling her now.

31:57.516 --> 32:01.653
(phone ringing)

32:01.687 --> 32:03.255
This is Flemming.

32:03.289 --> 32:06.158
Um... this is Torres?

32:08.294 --> 32:09.728
Why do you have
Agent Bishop's cell phone?

32:09.761 --> 32:12.264
And where the hell is mine?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.967
VANCE:
McGee, put up
the parking lot surveillance.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.303
(phone ringing)

32:28.447 --> 32:29.681
She's not answering.

32:29.715 --> 32:31.450
McGee, locate that phone.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.155
There it is.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.690
The bump, grab and slip.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.292
She must've been
waiting for me. I...

32:40.326 --> 32:42.728
I didn't even feel a thing.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.630
Yeah, she's either
a fast learner,

32:44.663 --> 32:46.498
or she's playing us.

32:47.599 --> 32:48.734
All right,
got a location.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.569
Bishop shut the cell off,
but I was able

32:50.602 --> 32:53.072
to ping the last tower
she was connected to.
Where?

32:53.105 --> 32:55.707
North of DC, Highway 19.

32:55.741 --> 32:57.709
Where's she going?
I don't know, but

32:57.743 --> 33:00.646
she sent a text
before she went dark.

33:00.679 --> 33:04.450
That's the number
the CIA uses to contact Chen.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.085
She knew I had the number.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.587
She's going after Chen.
We don't have time for this.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.589
McGee, finish that anti-virus.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.590
Torres, MTAC.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.492
Quinn, let's go.

33:16.528 --> 33:17.763
(brakes squeal)

33:23.835 --> 33:26.772
*

33:50.162 --> 33:53.099
*

34:03.309 --> 34:04.610
(electricity buzzes)

34:14.586 --> 34:17.589
All right, this is where
Bishop shut off the cell.

34:17.623 --> 34:19.258
What's her plan?

34:19.291 --> 34:21.627
To be honest, Agent Gibbs,
she may not have one.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.462
She always has a plan.

34:23.495 --> 34:24.696
I hope so,
but when it comes to Chen,

34:24.730 --> 34:26.465
she hasn't exactly
been thinking clearly.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.467
That makes two of you!

34:28.500 --> 34:30.102
All right, I got something.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.239
Radio tower.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.073
It's about 20 miles away.

35:02.468 --> 35:05.471
Agent Bishop.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.573
Surprise.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.442
I was expecting
the congresswoman.

35:10.476 --> 35:11.743
Well,
something came up.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.213
She sends her regards.

35:14.246 --> 35:15.581
I see.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.816
How did you know
I would be alone?

35:17.849 --> 35:19.685
Because you're a rat.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.587
And if your people found out

35:21.620 --> 35:25.324
you were doing business with
the CIA, you'd be a dead rat.

35:25.357 --> 35:27.693
You did not come here
to talk business.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.295
This is personal.

35:29.328 --> 35:33.365
No, this is pleasure.

35:33.399 --> 35:37.236
I am not responsible for what
happened to your boyfriend.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.870
He is.

35:38.904 --> 35:42.441
Qasim made his own choices
in life.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.943
QASIM:
I'm really sorry, Ellie.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.713
I shouldn't have pressured
you or said those things.

35:47.746 --> 35:50.616
No, you're right...
about everything. I...

35:50.649 --> 35:52.884
I know I overanalyze things.

35:52.918 --> 35:54.920
My mom says it's because
I prefer to think

35:54.953 --> 35:56.755
rather than feel.

35:56.788 --> 36:00.259
Yes, I use my brain
to push people away.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.197
I don't want to push you away.

36:05.231 --> 36:07.233
But?

36:07.266 --> 36:11.703
But... I'm just not ready.

36:11.737 --> 36:15.607
I'm not saying
I won't be one day.

36:15.641 --> 36:18.210
Well, I choose to wait.

36:18.244 --> 36:21.413
So take all the
time you need.

36:21.447 --> 36:24.483
I'm not going anywhere.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.552
You're right.

36:26.585 --> 36:29.855
Life is about choices, Chen.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.424
And I've made mine.

36:37.596 --> 36:40.799
I got him.

36:40.832 --> 36:44.803
In there. Move!

36:44.836 --> 36:47.406
You have nothing on me.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.974
Put those handcuffs on.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.510
We know about your plan

36:51.543 --> 36:53.445
to attack
the electrical grid.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.418
Knowing and proving

36:59.451 --> 37:01.820
are two entirely
different beasts.

37:01.853 --> 37:05.557
My lawyer will have me
free in two hours.

37:05.591 --> 37:07.893
NCIS is wasting its time.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.828
I didn't call NCIS.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.563
I called the Syrians.

37:11.597 --> 37:15.033
Apparently,
Asu Harari

37:15.066 --> 37:18.437
heard that you sold him out
to the CIA.

37:18.470 --> 37:19.838
He's been looking for you.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.974
A few of his American contacts
are on their way.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.910
(grunting)

37:24.943 --> 37:27.413
Have fun with that.

37:27.446 --> 37:30.382
Wait!

37:30.416 --> 37:32.918
Make it quick.
I've got a 3:00.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.920
You cannot do this.

37:34.953 --> 37:37.055
They're going to kill me.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.326
Only if you're lucky.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.394
I have money.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.863
Just name your price.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.632
You know what?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.034
I have a better idea.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.805
What is that?

37:53.839 --> 37:57.909
The code you created
to blow up all those generators.

37:57.943 --> 38:02.448
Just like the one
you're cuffed to.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.917
(panting)
You set me up.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.621
I'm not responsible
for what happens to you, Chen.

38:09.655 --> 38:13.659
You've made your choices
in life just like Qasim.

38:15.093 --> 38:17.729
And now
you have one more to make.

38:19.698 --> 38:21.467
(grunts)

38:23.469 --> 38:26.672
Bishop! Bishop!

38:36.948 --> 38:39.718
Bishop? You all right?

38:39.751 --> 38:43.422
(explosion)

38:46.124 --> 38:49.628
What happened?

38:49.661 --> 38:52.964
Chen forced Commander Turner
to make a Sophie's Choice.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.033
He just made his.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.809
Boat-building and booze?

39:03.842 --> 39:07.379
Sounds like
a dangerous combination.

39:07.413 --> 39:09.981
Hasn't failed me yet.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.150
I have to admit,

39:12.183 --> 39:14.986
your team impressed
the hell out of me, Gibbs.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.556
I think it's time you...

39:17.589 --> 39:20.492
climbed out
of the NCIS trenches.

39:20.526 --> 39:23.128
You've earned a seat
in the big chair.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.631
Director?

39:26.865 --> 39:29.034
Old Lee.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.638
That seat's taken.

39:32.671 --> 39:34.573
And if there's a vacancy?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.875
(door closes,
footsteps approaching)

39:36.908 --> 39:40.045
Sounds like you have company.

39:43.181 --> 39:45.451
Thank you for the time,
Agent Gibbs.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.619
I appreciate the consideration.

39:47.653 --> 39:52.123
And the discretion
about other things.

39:54.693 --> 39:55.927
Agent Bishop.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.464
Congresswoman.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.765
Uh.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.467
Wait.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.968
Just checking.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.007
Did I, uh,
interrupt something?

40:09.040 --> 40:11.142
No.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.078
Just talking about you.

40:13.111 --> 40:16.782
How much trouble am I in?

40:16.815 --> 40:19.117
With her?

40:19.150 --> 40:20.819
None.

40:20.852 --> 40:24.590
And you?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.994
Gibbs, uh...

40:29.027 --> 40:31.897
I don't blame you
if you want me gone.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.699
I broke your trust,
I went rogue,

40:33.732 --> 40:37.769
and I did exactly what
you were worried I would do.

40:37.803 --> 40:39.204
Twice.

40:39.237 --> 40:41.206
Yeah.

40:41.239 --> 40:45.811
But I also did exactly what you
would've done if you were me.

40:45.844 --> 40:49.648
And if I had to do it over,

40:49.681 --> 40:52.951
I'd do the exact
same thing again.

40:52.984 --> 40:56.555
Well, then we got a problem.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.962
Each time you go rogue,
there's a price to pay.

41:05.864 --> 41:08.099
And it's not cheap.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.570
I understand.
No.

41:11.603 --> 41:14.673
You don't.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.208
But you will soon.

41:25.617 --> 41:27.953
I got this for Qasim.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.822
I had it with me
the night he was shot.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.659
I never had the chance
to give it to him.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.961
I can't stop
looking at it.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.496
(paper rustling)

41:39.698 --> 41:42.233
But I need to.

41:47.205 --> 41:49.675
Thanks.
