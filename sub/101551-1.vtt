WEBVTT

00:41.216 --> 00:45.888
<i>Hey, jungle monster,
you ever been fucked by a girl?</i>

00:47.690 --> 00:49.257
<i>Cause Sally is horny.</i>

00:55.497 --> 00:56.899
<i>Good job, Sally.</i>

00:56.933 --> 00:59.802
When I grow up,
I want to be Butch Savage.

00:59.836 --> 01:02.337
I want to be Butch Savage.

01:02.371 --> 01:07.342
<i>Hey, little dudes and dudettes,
do you want to be the next Butch Savage?</i>

01:07.376 --> 01:12.749
<i>Then follow Butch's three rules
of living savage.</i>

01:12.782 --> 01:15.685
<i>Number one, never settle.</i>

01:15.718 --> 01:18.855
<i>You get too comfortable,
you lose your drive.</i>

01:18.888 --> 01:21.858
<i>Number two, work hard.</i>

01:21.891 --> 01:24.326
<i>There are no shortcuts.</i>

01:24.359 --> 01:29.799
<i>Number three, eat
sugary savage cereal every day.</i>

01:29.832 --> 01:34.771
<i>It'll give you strong muscles
and big brains like Butch.</i>

01:34.804 --> 01:38.741
<i>Get out of here, bananas,
I ain't no monkey.</i>

01:38.775 --> 01:41.811
<i>I'm a savage.</i>

01:41.844 --> 01:43.813
- Savage!
- Savage!

02:03.900 --> 02:06.703
My name is Luke. I'm from
Los Angeles, California.

02:06.736 --> 02:10.773
I live here in Reseda now
with my best friend Tanner.

02:10.807 --> 02:12.809
Dude, you're supposed to get
the missiles by the silo.

02:12.842 --> 02:15.878
And my favorite dog,
Mr. Perfect.

02:19.381 --> 02:21.617
Hey, uh, Luke,
you're being a little bitch or are you...

02:23.686 --> 02:26.354
My name's Tanner.
I live in Los Angeles.

02:26.388 --> 02:27.757
Look, here's the boob.

02:27.790 --> 02:30.660
I like to say that I am
electively a single.

02:30.693 --> 02:34.262
- All right, Henry.
- Henry. - Yeah.

02:34.296 --> 02:35.397
I like his new uniform.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.268
<i>Time to go to church.</i>

02:40.302 --> 02:42.337
Finish your beer.
We got Bingo at eight.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.607
- Oh, yes,
- <i>♪ Captain Wonder's ♪</i>

02:44.640 --> 02:46.609
<i>♪ Shit Show Bingo ♪</i>

02:46.642 --> 02:48.578
<i>♪ He's a homeless David Bowie
With stale popcorn ♪</i>

02:53.683 --> 02:56.686
All right, ladies and
gentlemen, this is Shit Show Bingo.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.654
Fine, fine, fine, fine.

02:58.688 --> 03:01.456
Ladies and gentlemen,
we got N39.

03:01.490 --> 03:04.426
N39 cocaine time.

03:04.459 --> 03:07.529
That's right,
looking for a little white girl.

03:08.931 --> 03:12.635
- By white girl I mean cocaine.
- Bingo!

03:14.003 --> 03:16.005
- She told me, no.
- Oh, yeah.

03:16.038 --> 03:20.076
Tanner works at my
all-time favorite bar No Bar.

03:20.109 --> 03:23.378
That mustache looks like
a rat got stuck on a glue trap.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.481
You look like the bad guy
from every '80s movie.

03:26.515 --> 03:28.584
You mind if I plug this in?

03:28.618 --> 03:32.088
- Can't you just get a new one if it dies?
- Tanner, it's late.

03:32.121 --> 03:34.489
I can't risk this
bad boy dying on me.

03:34.523 --> 03:36.626
There's nothing more embarrassing
than a grown man pushing a scooter.

03:36.659 --> 03:39.662
I don't want to call it a dive because
it's nicer than a dive, it's a lounge,

03:39.695 --> 03:41.530
just the kind of place
you go to hang out.

03:41.563 --> 03:43.833
How about a free drink
for your old friend, Gerry.

03:43.866 --> 03:45.668
What are you even doing here,
Gerry?

03:45.701 --> 03:48.004
- I eighty-sixed you last week.
- He eighty-sixed you last week.

03:48.037 --> 03:52.008
That was last week though.
It's this week. Okay.

03:52.041 --> 03:55.645
All right, don't talk about me
when I'm gone, please.

03:55.678 --> 03:57.379
Yeah. Bye, Gerry.

03:57.412 --> 03:59.882
Aside from Tanner
and, of course, Mr. Perfect,

03:59.916 --> 04:03.451
my third favorite person
in Los Angeles is Brandy.

04:03.485 --> 04:08.624
She's an angel sent down
for the world but mainly me.

04:08.658 --> 04:11.027
Brandy, how's the film industry?

04:11.060 --> 04:14.063
Brandy is great.
Luke's got a really big crush on her.

04:14.096 --> 04:16.699
She's super nice.
She's also a porn star.

04:16.732 --> 04:21.804
It's fucking exhausting. I had two
jobs today. My back is killing me.

04:22.705 --> 04:26.042
Tanner is convinced
that Brandy's in porn.

04:26.075 --> 04:30.378
I don't know. And, honestly,
if she does do porn, it doesn't bother me.

04:30.412 --> 04:32.949
I respect her right to do
what she wants with her body.

04:32.982 --> 04:35.685
My buddy Luke, he's got a
pretty sweet gig. He cleans pools.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.687
Um, he does it part time.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.723
I'm an idea man.
I'm an entrepreneur.

04:40.756 --> 04:46.028
Okay, I take an idea and I say, "What do
we need to turn the idea into reality?"

04:46.062 --> 04:48.430
What I present to you today

04:48.463 --> 04:51.399
is not just an opportunity to change
your bank account or your body.

04:51.433 --> 04:54.136
It's an opportunity
to change your life.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.838
I don't get it.

04:55.872 --> 04:58.875
Uh, he likes to say
he's an idea guy

04:58.908 --> 05:05.781
but usually his ideas involve getting
other people to help him sell, uh, teas,

05:05.815 --> 05:08.117
like weight loss teas.

05:08.150 --> 05:13.890
That's right, I sell tea, herbal
weight loss tea. But it really works.

05:13.923 --> 05:16.592
I get two dollars and
fifty cents from every sale.

05:16.626 --> 05:20.596
And if I recruit someone else, I get
a dollar twenty-five from their sales.

05:20.630 --> 05:25.500
It's incredible, man.
The sky is endless.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.469
Is that the right analogy?

05:27.502 --> 05:29.972
Anyway, I am about 25 grand
in debt from the stuff

05:30.006 --> 05:32.608
but Nicky Steele says...

05:32.642 --> 05:37.847
It takes money to make other people
make money to make you money.

05:40.850 --> 05:44.486
My life is good.
I have a job sometimes.

05:44.519 --> 05:49.091
But I come from a family
of excellence.

05:49.125 --> 05:53.863
There's a part of me that feels like
I am destined for bigger things.

05:53.896 --> 05:56.599
Nicky Steele's herbal
weight loss tea

05:56.632 --> 05:58.634
starts generating revenue
the minute you sign...

05:58.668 --> 06:00.970
- Why aren't you cleaning the pool?
- Jimmy.

06:01.003 --> 06:03.205
What are all these people doing
here? What's going on?

06:03.239 --> 06:05.675
Did we hire them? They feel old.

06:05.708 --> 06:07.576
- Do they swim?
- I can't swim.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.745
- I thought we were getting a free lunch.
- Yeah.

06:09.779 --> 06:13.916
My clients' houses are not a
backdrop for your pyramid scheme.

06:13.950 --> 06:18.955
Jimmy, is it really a pyramid
scheme if everybody makes money?

06:18.988 --> 06:20.890
Yes.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.260
But, Luke,
let's put it this way,

06:24.293 --> 06:30.633
his heart's in the right place but
his head it's crammed way up his ass.

06:33.035 --> 06:37.505
I'm sorry I... I liked your dad, Luke, he's
a great guy, but this is it, you gotta go.

06:37.539 --> 06:38.874
You're fired.

07:06.035 --> 07:09.605
I guess everyone has their
own way of wooing a potential mate.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.808
Tanner has this thing.

07:12.842 --> 07:13.743
Unbelievable.

07:13.776 --> 07:15.244
Dinner and a movie.

07:15.277 --> 07:19.015
Well, dinner
and a very specific movie.

07:20.349 --> 07:23.819
A moving drama
about the Holocaust.

07:23.853 --> 07:28.891
I hate that this works,
but it works.

07:34.730 --> 07:35.998
Call me, Tanner.

07:36.032 --> 07:37.133
May the odds ever be
in your favor.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.104
Tanner's really great.

07:42.138 --> 07:46.776
He's, uh, got really great hair
and, um...

07:50.312 --> 07:54.617
Dude, it's time for us to do
something with our lives.

07:54.650 --> 07:57.653
Look, dude, I support
your entrepreneurial spirit.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.357
I really do, but the weight loss
tea, no, thanks.

08:01.390 --> 08:05.895
I'm not talking about the tea, okay,
I'm talking about a real power move, okay?

08:05.928 --> 08:08.597
I'm talking about something to put us
on the map, man, get us out of Reseda.

08:08.631 --> 08:11.333
Let's take... let's take Mr. Perfect
and get up to the hills.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.235
Of course, I want to take
Mr. Perfect to the hills.

08:13.269 --> 08:16.305
But, dude, I make money to drink
and hang out with my friends.

08:16.338 --> 08:18.307
My life is pretty great.

08:19.842 --> 08:22.044
I mean, here's the thing.
I like working at the bar.

08:22.078 --> 08:25.314
I do. It's easy. It's fun.
I'm flushed with cash.

08:25.347 --> 08:29.251
Hell, half the time I take care of Luke's share
of the rent and it doesn't even bother me.

08:29.285 --> 08:33.989
But, um, you know,
my liver's got its limitations

08:34.023 --> 08:39.628
and, uh, you know, it's...
it's a gig with an expiration date.

08:42.865 --> 08:45.668
What's up big guy? What... what's got
you talking like a career counselor?

08:47.870 --> 08:51.841
What are you even doing here right now?
Did... did Jimmy fire you again?

08:53.342 --> 08:57.813
The little guy caught me selling my tea to
some people I met outside the nursing home.

08:59.115 --> 09:00.282
I need a scream shower.

09:06.822 --> 09:09.158
What's a scream shower?

09:13.028 --> 09:14.763
He thinks I can't hear him.

09:17.933 --> 09:19.101
Screaming.

09:24.406 --> 09:29.011
So then he says to me, "Well,
if it's a 401(k) and not a 403(b),

09:29.044 --> 09:30.846
are you really diversified?

09:37.353 --> 09:40.956
Okay, okay, okay, settle down, settle down.
Come on. Come on.

09:42.057 --> 09:43.425
Let us pray.

09:43.459 --> 09:45.728
Blessed to be here.

09:45.761 --> 09:48.964
Lord, Father, God,
thank you for Ryan

09:48.998 --> 09:54.036
who is striving to create job
opportunities for those less fortunate.

09:54.069 --> 09:56.105
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you. Thank you.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.942
I'm adopted,
which I'm thankful for

09:59.975 --> 10:03.212
but I think my dad
always wanted my brother

10:03.245 --> 10:06.315
and he got me
and then he got my brother.

10:06.348 --> 10:11.720
And, Luke, he's working
in pool sanitation, Lord,

10:11.754 --> 10:15.491
it is really something else.

10:18.127 --> 10:21.764
Lord Father God, we give thanks and praise
for all these wondrous and bountiful gifts

10:21.797 --> 10:24.166
in your and Jesus' name.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.901
Amen.

10:25.935 --> 10:27.970
Amen. Mm-mm.

10:28.003 --> 10:32.308
Apparently, before Luke came along,
our family was pretty well off.

10:32.341 --> 10:35.144
But we're glad to have a brother
though, you know.

10:36.779 --> 10:41.250
You know I, uh, been having a little, uh, little
drama going on at work myself these days.

10:41.283 --> 10:42.751
What's up, Dad?

10:42.785 --> 10:45.487
Well, as you may
or may not be aware,

10:45.521 --> 10:49.124
the attendance of the church has been
slowly declining since the late 90's.

10:49.158 --> 10:52.194
Our revenue is based mainly
on tithing.

10:52.228 --> 10:55.931
So, when the people disappear,
so does the money.

10:55.965 --> 10:58.968
We need 75 grand just to make
the rest of the year's rent.

10:59.001 --> 11:02.071
And then, eventually, we're going
to need another 100 to fix that roof

11:02.104 --> 11:03.739
that's not getting any better.

11:05.474 --> 11:10.779
You know, what we really need is our
own version of <i>Love is Underground</i>.

11:10.813 --> 11:14.116
I believe that those are Wild Wood
Brothers over in Charleston made.

11:14.149 --> 11:16.385
Oh, I saw that.

11:16.418 --> 11:20.256
The one where the police officers are
stuck in the sewer during a hurricane.

11:20.289 --> 11:22.358
You know,
they thought they were gonna die

11:22.391 --> 11:25.461
and then they found Jesus
and then they didn't die.

11:25.494 --> 11:27.429
Oh, I love that they don't die.

11:28.964 --> 11:31.166
So,
this was a financial success?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.102
Oh, yes, the church funded
it, completely paid off their mortgage.

11:33.135 --> 11:34.470
No way.

11:34.503 --> 11:36.205
I'm serious.
Look it up.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.008
Love is Underground,
stars, um, oh,

11:39.041 --> 11:44.079
oh, and wonderfully devout
young man from Growing Pains.

11:44.113 --> 11:46.015
And what is his name, uh...

11:46.048 --> 11:47.416
Kirk Cameron.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.118
It's already made
three million dollars.

11:49.151 --> 11:51.420
Oh, it's completely
revolutionized the church.

11:51.453 --> 11:53.522
Y'all couldn't have gone
into the film business.

11:53.555 --> 11:57.126
Well, anyway, I...
I suppose it's my fault.

11:57.159 --> 12:00.296
Uh, your mother,
God rest her sweet soul.

12:00.329 --> 12:02.965
Well, she wanted to put you all
in commercials

12:02.998 --> 12:06.935
to make some extra money to make up for Luke's
adoption fee which was pretty exorbitant.

12:06.969 --> 12:10.939
But, well, anyway,
I just couldn't stomach

12:10.973 --> 12:13.509
the thought of my child
being the face of yogurt.

12:15.377 --> 12:19.381
Oh, baby girl, this is so good.
Thank you. Praise God.

12:19.415 --> 12:20.349
Praise God.

12:25.622 --> 12:30.225
<i>Well, Sally, some people
might call this a dead end.</i>

12:30.259 --> 12:33.262
<i>What do you say
we make it a cul-de-sac?</i>

12:35.264 --> 12:38.534
Can we cease the fucking
Butch Savage marathon, please?

12:38.567 --> 12:41.136
Butch Savage is a great
American hero.

12:41.170 --> 12:46.875
Can you name another wrestler slash actor
slash independent presidential candidate?

12:46.909 --> 12:51.280
- Whatever.
- Brandy, looking great like a brand-new pair of socks.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.049
- What?
- Never mind.

12:55.551 --> 12:59.589
Tanner, have you heard of a
movie called <i>Love Is Underground</i>?

13:01.523 --> 13:03.158
It's about some cops
in the sewer.

13:03.192 --> 13:04.426
I guess I must have missed it.

13:04.460 --> 13:06.295
What about <i>God's Not Dead</i>?

13:06.328 --> 13:09.498
It's a Christian movie
starring Kevin Sorbo.

13:09.531 --> 13:14.002
That movie starring Hercules
was shot for nothing

13:14.036 --> 13:17.573
and now, it's a
multi-million-dollar franchise.

13:17.607 --> 13:19.575
What are you saying?
You want to go see a Christian movie?

13:19.609 --> 13:22.311
I want to make
a Christian movie.

13:23.946 --> 13:26.315
I want to make the best Christian
movie Jesus has ever seen.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.517
Nobody buys movies anymore.

13:28.550 --> 13:31.520
I have over 150 credits
all online.

13:31.553 --> 13:32.921
That's where it's at.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.925
Wow, look at this.
<i>War Room</i>, 73 million.

13:36.959 --> 13:39.228
<i>Courageous</i>, 33 million.

13:39.261 --> 13:40.996
<i>Fireproof</i>, 35 million.

13:41.029 --> 13:44.032
Christians support
anything Christian.

13:44.066 --> 13:48.470
Churches, literally, buy out
entire theaters, rent buses,

13:48.504 --> 13:51.540
and take their congregation
to see movies.

13:51.573 --> 13:55.010
Faith-based,
the entire genre is a gold mine.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.378
Yeah.

13:56.412 --> 13:58.947
- Are you in?
- What, "Am I in"?

13:58.981 --> 14:03.952
Dude, this is, um, this is a good idea.
This is a really good idea.

14:03.986 --> 14:07.489
But I make margaritas
and you clean pools.

14:07.523 --> 14:09.958
Neither one of us know anything
about making movies.

14:09.992 --> 14:11.326
Exactly.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.663
She knows a lot
about making movies.

14:13.696 --> 14:16.565
Yeah, I do. Thank you.
I mean, kind of.

14:17.533 --> 14:21.170
Plus, dude,
it seems like a lot of work.

14:23.338 --> 14:25.240
Nicky Steele says...

14:25.274 --> 14:27.309
You work hard, you play hard.

14:27.342 --> 14:29.646
You work harder,
you play harder.

14:29.679 --> 14:33.182
You work hardest,
you play rock hard.

14:36.586 --> 14:39.988
If I see Nicky Steele,
I'm going to kick him in the dick.

14:40.022 --> 14:41.290
Uh, Herman, you want another?

14:42.491 --> 14:46.061
Does a tree shit in the woods
if you don't hear it fall?

14:46.094 --> 14:48.330
That's a yes.

14:48.363 --> 14:52.401
I hear you, old timer. Just a five-pound
bag of flour make a big ass biscuit.

14:52.434 --> 14:56.673
Holy fucking shit. Tanner!

14:56.706 --> 14:58.474
Hey, man, how you doing?

14:58.507 --> 15:00.409
- No, you still work here?
- Yeah, man, it's the best.

15:00.442 --> 15:04.313
Whoa. This guy right here
is a fucking legend.

15:04.346 --> 15:06.114
What's it been, like,
10 years now?

15:06.148 --> 15:08.685
No, no, no,
like, uh, like seven.

15:08.718 --> 15:11.320
Yeah, give or take
daylight saving whatnots.

15:11.353 --> 15:13.021
I mean I remember you man.

15:13.055 --> 15:15.524
First time I met this guy,
pay attention future me,

15:15.557 --> 15:18.327
it was Halloween, you were
dressed as Napoleon Dynamite.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.462
He had his fucking hair permed
and all that shit.

15:20.496 --> 15:21.530
It's flipping sweet.

15:21.563 --> 15:24.132
Man, you were going places.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.705
It was 2007, is that right?

15:28.738 --> 15:30.572
2004.

15:31.674 --> 15:33.342
Who's playing pool,
motherfuckers?

15:33.375 --> 15:35.177
Hey, come smell my finger.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.785
I'm in.

15:48.457 --> 15:50.158
Man, look at this one.

15:50.192 --> 15:53.630
This is a farming drama
called <i>Jesus Plows</i>.

15:53.663 --> 15:55.397
Oh, wow.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.366
Look, this is a religious
NASCAR movie.

15:57.399 --> 15:59.301
That's racing on the streets
of gold.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.837
Religious NASCAR.

16:00.870 --> 16:03.238
Or maybe we watch
the <i>Firefighter saga</i>,

16:03.272 --> 16:07.142
<i>High Risk Higher Purpose</i>
one, two and three.

16:07.175 --> 16:10.345
And if they're making three
of those, they're making money.

16:10.379 --> 16:13.716
All of these are made by the same
company, it's called Christflix.

16:13.750 --> 16:14.784
I'm gonna email them.

16:18.420 --> 16:21.523
"Dear Sir or Madam,

16:21.557 --> 16:25.360
we are two young gentlemen
looking to make a Christian movie

16:25.394 --> 16:28.297
for our Lord and savior's body.

16:28.330 --> 16:32.200
We'd love to meet with you
before he is risen.

16:32.234 --> 16:35.404
AKA,
at your earliest convenience.

16:35.437 --> 16:36.371
Truly...

16:38.540 --> 16:40.743
Amen, Luke and Tanner."

16:51.386 --> 16:55.557
So, we were thinking,
what about a family drama?

16:55.592 --> 16:58.293
You know what, I'm gonna stop you
right there. I don't give a shit.

16:58.327 --> 17:01.263
For these movies to make money,
it needs four things.

17:01.296 --> 17:02.732
Four.

17:02.765 --> 17:05.467
One, two, three, four.

17:05.500 --> 17:10.172
One, you need an A, B, or C list
celebrity who's also a Christian,

17:10.205 --> 17:12.174
at the very least a Republican.

17:12.207 --> 17:15.612
I mean Kirk Cameron,
Kevin Sorbo, the fat Superman.

17:15.645 --> 17:17.780
- Dean Cain. He's a real deal actor.
- Mm-Hmm.

17:17.814 --> 17:20.750
Two, you need some keywords
in the title.

17:20.783 --> 17:25.755
I'm talking purpose, faith,
prayer, heaven, Huckabee.

17:25.788 --> 17:29.726
Yeah, yeah, think like, you know,
<i>Thoughts & Prayers,</i> the movie <i>,</i> you know.

17:29.759 --> 17:32.829
<i>Or like, uh,</i>
<i>Faith and Furious</i>, you know.

17:32.862 --> 17:36.298
Uh, like, uh,
<i>Prayer and Prejudice</i>, you know.

17:36.331 --> 17:38.467
<i>I Heart Huckabee.</i>

17:38.500 --> 17:39.869
- I think that one's taken.
- Oh, that's actually... I think that is a movie.

17:39.902 --> 17:41.536
But anyway, you know,
you get the idea.

17:41.570 --> 17:44.272
Three, peril.

17:44.306 --> 17:48.543
Most people become Christians when they are
three years old or if they're faced with death.

17:48.578 --> 17:52.682
So, unless you're going to make
the Christian look who's talking,

17:52.715 --> 17:55.350
I need some dire straits.

17:55.384 --> 17:59.254
Yeah, I think hikers lost on Everest, you
know, a rodeo clown facing his last bull,

17:59.287 --> 18:03.893
or a homeless woman who discovers that
her cat is really her guardian angel

18:03.926 --> 18:08.430
and then the homeless woman turns
out to be Kentucky clerk Kim Davis.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.232
That'd be awesome.
I'm just spitballing.

18:10.265 --> 18:13.703
But, um, lastly,
you got to talk about God.

18:13.736 --> 18:15.938
It doesn't have to be God, God,

18:15.972 --> 18:21.443
you can talk about it like a higher
power or just straight up JC.

18:21.476 --> 18:22.979
Bonus points
if God's actually in it.

18:23.012 --> 18:26.481
Yeah, but good luck.
His agent's a real asshole.

18:29.919 --> 18:32.554
Why do all these
Christian movies have to be bad?

18:33.555 --> 18:38.895
They don't have to be bad.
They just don't have to be good.

18:38.928 --> 18:42.330
Your dad's gonna buy anything
that has Jesus in it somewhere.

18:43.365 --> 18:45.735
Get me a movie
with those four things

18:45.768 --> 18:49.005
and I will write you a check for
two hundred thousand dollars.

18:49.038 --> 18:50.773
Boom.

18:50.807 --> 18:54.577
I mean why don't you
just help us finance our movie?

19:01.684 --> 19:03.418
No.

19:03.452 --> 19:06.622
What kind of sucker would invest
in an imaginary dream

19:06.656 --> 19:09.025
that might somehow benefit them
in the end?

19:09.058 --> 19:10.827
No.

19:10.860 --> 19:15.031
But if you figure out
how to make it, I will buy it

19:15.064 --> 19:19.769
and if it costs less than 200k,
you can keep the profits.

19:19.802 --> 19:22.270
Would you mind
if I prayed over us real quick?

19:22.304 --> 19:23.606
- I mean, I just feel like...
- You know what, no. Fuck no.

19:27.677 --> 19:28.978
So, how do you know this woman?

19:29.011 --> 19:32.547
Um, me and Tiff dated
back in 2014.

19:33.448 --> 19:35.350
- Damn.
- It ended well.

19:36.052 --> 19:37.319
- Did it?
- Pretty well.

19:37.352 --> 19:38.320
Hey, Tanner.

19:38.353 --> 19:39.421
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:39.454 --> 19:40.489
How are you doing?

19:40.522 --> 19:42.357
Wow.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.459
- You... you look... you look amazing.
- Uh... Hi.

19:44.493 --> 19:46.662
- Hi. Hello. Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

19:46.696 --> 19:48.030
I'm... Wow, I'm good.

19:50.767 --> 19:52.367
You are good.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.770
- You are good. Yeah.
- Ah... Thanks. Thanks.

19:53.803 --> 19:56.706
Hey, um, where am I?

19:56.739 --> 19:58.306
This is the Encino Velodrome.

20:04.013 --> 20:05.447
It was built in 1962.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.583
They did the Olympic
trials here.

20:07.617 --> 20:09.852
That's Henry,
he practices on Sundays.

20:13.923 --> 20:15.658
That's great. Wow.

20:15.691 --> 20:18.393
So, uh, what's... what's going on?

20:18.426 --> 20:19.695
Why'd you call?

20:19.729 --> 20:22.330
Um, we want to make a movie.

20:22.364 --> 20:23.866
We're going to make a movie.

20:23.900 --> 20:26.401
We're...
we're going to make a movie

20:26.434 --> 20:31.107
and, uh, we thought it would be smart to
enlist the help of a filmmaker friend.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.610
Tanner told me all about your short
film at Sundance. Sounds awesome.

20:34.644 --> 20:40.850
I... wanted to preface just kind of by saying what
we're about to tell you is a great opportunity.

20:42.551 --> 20:44.553
Who is this?

20:44.587 --> 20:49.725
- Um, this, you might remember, is my friend Luke.
- I'm Luke.

20:52.028 --> 20:55.064
- Luke. Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.097 --> 20:57.133
Um, wow.

20:57.166 --> 21:00.036
- Yeah, so you and Luke want to make a movie.
- Mm-hmm.

21:00.069 --> 21:01.804
Do you have a director
who's directing?

21:01.838 --> 21:04.573
- Co...
- You're... you're directing with him?

21:04.607 --> 21:05.708
Do you have a script?

21:05.741 --> 21:07.409
- Writing it.
- Working on it.

21:07.442 --> 21:08.978
- Okay, you're gonna write a script.
- Mm-hmm.

21:09.011 --> 21:09.946
Do you have a producer?

21:11.747 --> 21:14.382
You know you need
a producer, right?

21:14.416 --> 21:17.587
Like, you have to have somebody who can connect
all the dots and make all the things happen.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.522
You gotta get your shit
together, guys.

21:20.555 --> 21:22.658
What about post-production?
Have you thought about that?

21:22.692 --> 21:24.894
Have you thought about
who's gonna do your editing?

21:24.927 --> 21:27.029
You've got color correction to deal with.
You've got special effects.

21:27.063 --> 21:29.131
- Mm-hm. Tiffany.
- Yeah.

21:29.165 --> 21:32.134
You are so smart.

21:32.168 --> 21:34.904
Will you help us, please?

21:34.937 --> 21:37.139
Please, please, please,
will you help us? Come on.

21:37.173 --> 21:39.507
We want to make
a really good movie.

21:39.541 --> 21:43.646
Only because you are still
clearly doing CrossFit,

21:43.679 --> 21:48.117
- your abs are popping, I... I will help you a little bit.
- Okay.

21:48.150 --> 21:49.451
What are you doing later?

21:49.484 --> 21:50.786
You know what I'm doing later.

21:50.820 --> 21:52.454
- Yeah. I don't feel great.
- Okay.

21:59.729 --> 22:03.866
Hey, you two tried, uh,
not sucking at this?

22:03.900 --> 22:05.768
Okay.

22:05.801 --> 22:08.204
- These guys, every fucking Tuesday.
- Every fucking Tuesday.

22:08.237 --> 22:11.674
Anyway, I think we write
something original.

22:13.475 --> 22:16.012
You know it's like,
uh, Shawshank.

22:16.045 --> 22:19.982
It's a guy in prison, he doesn't want to
be there anymore and so, he breaks out.

22:20.016 --> 22:21.717
- It's cliché.
- Yeah.

22:21.751 --> 22:25.821
You two are getting schooled
by this rookie, I found.

22:25.855 --> 22:29.158
You seen this guy?
Call him Scottish Thor.

22:29.191 --> 22:32.460
Found him up at this, uh,
liquor store up Lankershim.

22:32.494 --> 22:34.597
Guy was already holding an ax
in his hand.

22:34.630 --> 22:35.865
Perfect.

22:35.898 --> 22:38.701
Come on, go play dart.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.938
- Every Tuesday, he's the worst.
- Every Tuesday, these guys.

22:41.971 --> 22:44.173
So, what do you want to do?
You just write something ourselves?

22:44.206 --> 22:46.676
No man, Nicky Steele says...

22:46.709 --> 22:49.511
You really want the job done,
you've got to do it...

22:49.544 --> 22:50.980
All by yourself. Yeah, I know.

22:51.013 --> 22:53.883
Hey, Nicky Steele doesn't rely
on other people.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.585
Nicky Steele should have relied
on a lawyer.

22:56.619 --> 23:00.555
The guy spent years in prison
before he came up with the tea scam.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.524
Apples and oranges, Tanner.

23:02.557 --> 23:03.826
Apples and...

23:03.859 --> 23:05.061
oranges.

23:07.229 --> 23:08.731
Oh, shit.

23:08.764 --> 23:09.799
Yeah.

23:20.810 --> 23:22.778
- <i>Huh?</i>
- Yo, where you at?

23:22.812 --> 23:24.647
The crew's going to be here
any minute?

23:24.680 --> 23:27.249
<i>Shit! Dude,</i>
<i>I'm sorry I totally blanked.</i>

23:27.283 --> 23:28.985
Why are you out of breath?

23:29.018 --> 23:30.518
<i>What?</i>

23:30.552 --> 23:33.155
Wait, is that Gaga
in the background?

23:34.190 --> 23:36.959
Yeah, that's definitely a weight dropping.
Dude, are you doing CrossFit?

23:36.993 --> 23:38.694
What? No, no, no, that's crazy.

23:39.662 --> 23:41.664
It's too much, man.
You gotta stop.

23:41.697 --> 23:43.565
There is nothing weird about it.

23:43.599 --> 23:46.202
Great job, Tanner.
Awesome elbows.

23:46.235 --> 23:48.104
Dude.

23:48.137 --> 23:50.039
<i>Okay, listen up,</i>
<i>just gather up the troops</i>

23:50.072 --> 23:51.140
<i>and I'll be there in an hour
to pound out the script.</i>

23:58.948 --> 24:01.717
There they are,
the mighty ducks.

24:01.751 --> 24:04.620
Why do we need to do this
on Monday?

24:04.653 --> 24:05.855
Jesus, Herman.

24:05.888 --> 24:07.590
It's Saturday, man.

24:07.623 --> 24:11.227
Yeah, I guess my eyes
are bigger than my liver.

24:11.260 --> 24:15.064
Uh, well, right now,
I'm, uh, working on this movie.

24:15.097 --> 24:16.799
Beer.

24:16.832 --> 24:19.135
- There he is.
- Oh.

24:19.168 --> 24:26.008
Ah, Luke's offered to, uh, pay me with,
uh, free drinks and, uh, that's fine.

24:27.877 --> 24:29.245
Isn't it a little early?

24:29.278 --> 24:31.747
I don't need a clock
to tell me I'm thirsty.

24:31.781 --> 24:35.351
I think I have a lot to offer. Um, I'm...
I mean, I'm in the film industry,

24:35.384 --> 24:39.955
so, I have a lot of
hands-on experience, um, myself.

24:39.989 --> 24:42.124
But, like if this were
<i>Dumb and Dumber,</i>

24:42.158 --> 24:44.894
Tanner would be the dumb and Luke
would definitely be the dumber.

24:45.828 --> 24:47.897
So, it could be
a giant shit show.

24:47.930 --> 24:50.199
We're going to assign
some tasks.

24:50.232 --> 24:55.037
This is a little thing my filmmaking
for dummies book calls pre-production.

24:55.071 --> 24:56.972
I can tell you one thing.

24:57.006 --> 24:59.141
We're going to need
a green screen.

24:59.175 --> 25:04.346
Marlon, how hard would it be
to blow up something?

25:04.380 --> 25:08.384
I have an idea. For such an epic in shot
it could only be pulled off by someone...

25:08.417 --> 25:10.753
Somebody who specializes in
explosives in Iraq War Part 1.

25:10.786 --> 25:12.221
Exactly.

25:12.254 --> 25:14.757
Give me the date of the shoot,
motherfucker.

25:14.790 --> 25:17.993
I asked Luke what the fuck
is a faith-based movie.

25:18.027 --> 25:20.062
He said, no, you know,
essentially, it's about religion

25:20.096 --> 25:22.398
and keep those answers short
because if you start getting I...

25:22.431 --> 25:24.166
I lose my concentration.

25:24.200 --> 25:29.071
Brandy, some problems
can only be solved over a meal.

25:29.105 --> 25:31.006
- PJ's Diner has a special...
- Not gonna happen.

25:32.174 --> 25:33.075
Okay.

25:34.276 --> 25:35.945
Let's talk cameras.

25:35.978 --> 25:37.980
Who here understands
how they work?

25:44.353 --> 25:45.921
Gotta get some det cord.

25:45.955 --> 25:50.726
Yeah, is, uh, Mel Harris
still alive?

25:50.759 --> 25:52.194
Mel?

25:52.228 --> 25:53.696
Mel, this is Herman.

25:53.729 --> 25:56.198
I know it's been like 35 years,

25:56.232 --> 25:59.668
but I've got a picture that I'm producing
here I'd really like you to be a part of it.

25:59.702 --> 26:02.371
- Let's think prayer.
- Mm-hm.

26:02.404 --> 26:03.973
Where have we never seen
one done?

26:04.006 --> 26:05.274
Uh, prayer and war.

26:05.307 --> 26:06.942
They pray in like
every war movie.

26:06.976 --> 26:09.044
<i>Saving Private Ryan, Platoon.</i>

26:09.078 --> 26:12.281
Blow up a tank, a jeep.

26:12.314 --> 26:14.283
What about a prayer at sea?

26:15.284 --> 26:17.119
<i>Titanic. Sharknado.</i>

26:17.153 --> 26:19.155
I blew up a whale one time.

26:19.188 --> 26:21.056
You know what movie
they never pray in?

26:23.225 --> 26:24.126
<i>Alien.</i>

26:27.363 --> 26:28.831
A prayer in space.

26:28.864 --> 26:30.366
Blow up alien.

26:30.399 --> 26:33.402
The first prayer ever
to be prayed in space.

26:33.435 --> 26:36.338
An astronaut stuck on Mars

26:36.372 --> 26:41.076
being chased by aliens and crazy
creatures shouts out to her creator...

26:41.110 --> 26:44.713
"Lord, save me
from these space monsters."

26:44.747 --> 26:48.784
And whose face burst
through the clouds to save her?

26:48.817 --> 26:49.985
God!

26:52.021 --> 26:53.022
- God.
- God.

26:55.257 --> 26:58.727
We've got the crew.
We're working on the cast.

26:58.761 --> 27:01.330
Now we just need to find
the golden goose.

27:03.032 --> 27:05.467
That means money.
We're looking for money.

27:05.501 --> 27:07.336
All right. So then, it's like...

27:11.307 --> 27:13.909
...the spaceship lands perfectly
on Mars.

27:15.911 --> 27:17.313
Boom.

27:17.346 --> 27:20.282
This has been a Luke
and Tanner production.

27:21.951 --> 27:23.385
Uh, it's beautiful.

27:23.419 --> 27:25.221
Hey, how are you thinking
we finance this thing?

27:25.254 --> 27:26.889
We, like, try to get a loan
or talk to a rich friend?

27:26.922 --> 27:29.258
Dude, you remember
what Jane said?

27:29.291 --> 27:32.294
She said what kind of suckers would give
money to some sort of imaginary dream

27:32.328 --> 27:35.231
in hopes that in the end
it would benefit them?

27:35.264 --> 27:37.233
Yeah, but Nicky Steele says...

27:37.266 --> 27:40.336
Don't bother finding the people
who believe in you.

27:40.369 --> 27:45.908
Find the people who believe in the
idea of you and the idea of your ideas.

27:52.014 --> 27:55.050
Hey dad, I'm with Tanner.

27:55.084 --> 27:56.418
What's your weekend look like?

28:00.889 --> 28:05.561
<i>♪ I hung a cross

28:05.595 --> 28:10.065

28:54.943 --> 28:56.111

28:57.846 --> 29:01.183
This one pours a hazy golden yellow color
with a white head that clings to the glass,

29:01.216 --> 29:05.387
aroma of rye and spice
and even some grassy notes.

29:05.421 --> 29:07.089
It's coffee?

29:07.122 --> 29:08.424
Oh, yes.

29:08.457 --> 29:10.059
Grown in Chile
in the southernmost...

29:10.092 --> 29:11.126
I just want a coffee.

29:16.666 --> 29:18.567
But why Guatemala?

29:18.601 --> 29:23.339
Because, basically, it's sunny
in Guatemala 270 days a year.

29:23.372 --> 29:24.641
Seriously, that many.

29:24.674 --> 29:26.609
- Two hundred and seventy?
- Yeah.

29:26.643 --> 29:30.245
Um, have you ever seen a little
movie called <i>Schindler's List</i>?

29:30.279 --> 29:31.180
It's church.

29:31.213 --> 29:33.048
Come to see if my dad...

29:33.082 --> 29:35.484
All right,
put your hands up, Elevates.

29:35.517 --> 29:37.486
How big is your love?

29:37.519 --> 29:40.356
- My love is big.
- Yeah, my love is big, too.

29:40.389 --> 29:42.191
You know whose love
is the biggest?

29:42.224 --> 29:43.292
- Christ's.
- Wow.

29:44.393 --> 29:46.462
So, how big is your love?

29:46.495 --> 29:49.298
And how big is your cross?

29:49.331 --> 29:52.034
- There's a symbol of that love.
- I'll just sit in the back.

29:52.067 --> 29:56.004
I've a very, very small
room but my cross is still enormous.

29:56.038 --> 29:57.139
It's big.

29:57.172 --> 29:59.508
- It's enormous.
- Oh, Jesus.

29:59.541 --> 30:00.909
Here we go.

30:00.943 --> 30:04.413
<i>♪ If I had a life-size cross ♪</i>

30:34.443 --> 30:36.011
Thank you.

30:37.446 --> 30:39.114
All right, you can have a seat,
Elevate Church.

30:41.584 --> 30:44.019
Hello, Elevate.

30:44.052 --> 30:47.089
Let's give it up one more time
for the Incredible Band.

30:50.092 --> 30:51.293
Right.

30:51.326 --> 30:52.762
Well, before you all leave,

30:52.796 --> 30:55.364
I do want to let you know what our
mission's team members were up to.

31:03.238 --> 31:06.475
Did you guys...
Did you guys see that?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.988
She was looking like
right at me.

31:20.022 --> 31:23.325
So, that's it for today, you guys.
Have a wonderful Sunday.

31:23.358 --> 31:25.561
And remember, stay woke.

31:37.306 --> 31:39.441
I want to get out of here
as soon as possible.

31:39.475 --> 31:42.344
Hey. Aloha, amigos,
welcome to Elevate.

31:42.377 --> 31:43.445
I'm Hoyt.

31:43.479 --> 31:45.314
Is this your first time here?

31:47.382 --> 31:50.152
Elevate is a community of people
just looking to do life together.

31:50.185 --> 31:52.387
Anyway, we're just here
to meet my dad.

31:52.421 --> 31:55.023
He's actually the pastor here.

31:55.057 --> 31:57.092
Oh, you're Pastor Michael's son?

31:57.125 --> 31:59.261
- Yeah, I'm Pastor Michael's son.
- Wow.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.496
But he's...

32:02.397 --> 32:04.734
You know and you're not...

32:04.767 --> 32:06.401
I'm adopted.

32:06.435 --> 32:07.569
Oh.

32:07.604 --> 32:10.072
- Jesus.
- Oh, easy, bud.

32:10.840 --> 32:11.741
Listening.

32:14.309 --> 32:15.344
We're good guy.

32:16.545 --> 32:18.080
Let's go find my dad.

32:20.717 --> 32:22.585
You're not gonna believe this.

32:22.619 --> 32:25.454
Christflix said they'll give us
two hundred thousand dollars.

32:25.487 --> 32:27.624
We split it, 50/50.

32:27.657 --> 32:29.726
Elevate pays off their mortgage.

32:29.759 --> 32:33.763
Tanner and I get a film career and
you would be the executive producer.

32:34.731 --> 32:37.667
We do an offering,
like you do for the mission's trips.

32:38.601 --> 32:41.336
What's the budget
of this so-called movie?

32:41.370 --> 32:46.074
Um, we're gonna need food,
cameras, um, sound design.

32:46.108 --> 32:48.143
Sound design.
Sound design has to be epic.

32:48.176 --> 32:50.178
- It's gotta be right up there with <i>Sharknado</i>.
- Yeah.

32:50.212 --> 32:51.213
You know, that's the....

33:04.126 --> 33:06.161
- Yeah, so probably at least a thousand there, maybe.
- Yeah.

33:06.194 --> 33:07.664
Also, the actor's
probably gonna be pricey.

33:07.697 --> 33:09.799
We're planning to get
some real star power.

33:09.832 --> 33:12.267
Nobody wants to watch a movie
starring somebody they don't know.

33:14.436 --> 33:16.706
You boys clearly
haven't thought this through.

33:16.739 --> 33:19.141
Actually, Sir, we have.

33:22.244 --> 33:23.512
What do you two even know
about making a movie?

33:23.545 --> 33:26.248
We... we know everything
about movies.

33:26.281 --> 33:28.685
I've been watching movies in
your basement since I was seven.

33:30.419 --> 33:33.890
You do realize that watching
a movie and making movie...

33:33.923 --> 33:36.659
Never mind, Lord.

33:36.693 --> 33:39.596
Tanner, did you know that I had
to get Luke that pool cleaning job

33:39.629 --> 33:41.330
from the man who cleans
our baptismal?

33:42.632 --> 33:45.267
And I told Jimmy
my son was reliable.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.202
Guess what Jimmy told me
last week?

33:47.235 --> 33:51.340
That good help is hard
to come by, impossible even.

33:53.241 --> 33:56.445
Tanner, look, now, I'm not
worried about you, but Luke...

33:56.478 --> 33:58.915
Well, come on, son,
let's face it,

33:58.948 --> 34:02.619
we all know that you love finding
a deal that's too good to be true.

34:02.652 --> 34:09.626
I mean, you should see the stack of tea I have in
my closet down and, oh, floor to ceiling, son.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.429
Floor to ceiling.

34:15.865 --> 34:17.767
Dad, we can do this.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.134
We just need a little help.

34:20.202 --> 34:22.537
This could be like that church
in South Carolina.

34:22.571 --> 34:23.940
Okay?

34:23.973 --> 34:25.808
Your version
of <i>Love is Undergroun</i>.

34:25.842 --> 34:27.275
We could save the church.

34:27.309 --> 34:29.378
We could be
your Wild Wood Brothers.

34:34.216 --> 34:35.718
I... suppose you could.

34:37.820 --> 34:42.190
But let's be honest, boys...

34:43.926 --> 34:45.360
you'll not.

34:47.529 --> 34:50.867
You know how a lot of people say
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree

34:50.900 --> 34:53.502
when it comes to kids
and their parents?

34:53.535 --> 34:56.839
Well, with Luke and his dad, it's like Luke,
the apple, was falling out of the tree

34:56.873 --> 34:58.875
but before it hit the ground,
somebody grabbed it

34:58.908 --> 35:01.276
and then chunked it
into the neighbor's yard

35:01.309 --> 35:02.477
because they're not alike
at all.

35:04.847 --> 35:07.215
- He never saw potential in me.
- That's not true.

35:07.249 --> 35:11.453
No, it is true. My dad's the nicest
guy in the world to everybody but me.

35:11.486 --> 35:12.822
When we were
in the fourth grade.

35:12.855 --> 35:14.691
Ryan wanted to do
a lemonade stand, okay.

35:14.724 --> 35:17.627
Bought the lemons, set up a
table, made a colorful sign.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.929
I went to do it
and my dad stopped me.

35:19.962 --> 35:23.265
He said, "We can't risk what happened
with the boy scouts happening again."

35:23.298 --> 35:24.734
What happened
with the boy scouts?

35:24.767 --> 35:26.636
There's a reason
they don't sell cookies anymore.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.709
It's time to show my dad
what we can do.

35:32.742 --> 35:34.342
What?

35:34.376 --> 35:35.978
Let's sell these people
on funding our dream.

35:36.012 --> 35:37.714
You want to take advantage
of these people?

35:37.747 --> 35:39.481
- I want to help them.
- We're gonna...

35:39.514 --> 35:40.583
I got an idea.

35:46.823 --> 35:51.761
Matthew, Mark, Luke and...

35:52.962 --> 35:54.463
Uh, Tanner.

35:54.496 --> 35:56.766
Tanner, this is Troy.

35:56.799 --> 36:00.469
He's done the videos of my dad's
church for like 20 years.

36:00.502 --> 36:01.871
He went to film school.

36:01.904 --> 36:04.907
The Oxnard School
for the Cinematic Arts.

36:04.941 --> 36:07.009
The Oxnard School.

36:07.043 --> 36:11.346
Troy, Tanner and I want to make an
incredible Christian feature film.

36:11.379 --> 36:12.915
We were thinking
you could help us,

36:12.949 --> 36:15.585
show the church people
our potential.

36:17.519 --> 36:20.388
The Prodigal Son Returns.

36:20.422 --> 36:23.793
But to reach the flock,
he needs a master.

36:24.961 --> 36:26.528
Okay.

36:26.561 --> 36:29.564
Oh, um, Luke and I know
a lot about movies,

36:29.599 --> 36:32.367
we just don't know a lot
about making a Christian movie.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.505
I think you've come to the
right Christian, filmmaker.

36:36.538 --> 36:40.810
Now, if there's one thing I learned at
Oxnard School for the Cinematic Arts,

36:40.843 --> 36:45.982
it's that if you want to make a feature
film, you've got to start with a short...

36:47.016 --> 36:49.018
A short what?

36:50.452 --> 36:51.888
A short film.

37:00.062 --> 37:02.098
All right, next.

37:02.131 --> 37:05.635
Hi. My name is Rheagann
and I really like space.

37:05.668 --> 37:08.570
- I love kids, man. Kids are honest.
- Yeah.

37:10.039 --> 37:13.308
Hey, big nose,
you got a big nose.

37:14.811 --> 37:17.445
- You set up these auditions?
- Look, you said kids were honest.

37:17.479 --> 37:20.549
You look like if you took off your
glasses, your nose would come with it.

37:21.449 --> 37:23.686
Thank you very much.
You did great.

37:23.719 --> 37:27.790
You look like if Draco Malfoy drank
Monster and listened to Nickelback.

37:27.824 --> 37:30.026
- Hear me.
- We gotta find somebody to play God.

37:31.694 --> 37:33.495
What do you think
about Hulk Hogan?

37:33.528 --> 37:35.564
Oh, Christermania, brother.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.399
Next.

37:37.432 --> 37:43.039
How dost thou leave thine craft
mindfully towards the heavens.

37:43.072 --> 37:48.744
Thou art not one with Earth
and yet art.

37:49.912 --> 37:53.649
I didn't understand a whole lot
of it but it sounded like music.

37:53.683 --> 37:55.685
- I'm classically trained, so.
- Oh.

37:56.586 --> 37:58.921
Midpoint montage.

37:58.955 --> 38:00.590
See what I'm doing?

38:00.623 --> 38:02.390
- When it's separate?
- Yes, exactly.

38:02.424 --> 38:04.627
And then together,
they learn and they go.

38:04.660 --> 38:06.028
Act three.

38:06.062 --> 38:07.763
Okay, do we have to do that now?

38:07.797 --> 38:09.832
Next.

38:09.866 --> 38:14.837
I believe the best way to
experience space is through dance.

38:14.871 --> 38:17.173
Five, six, seven, eight.

38:23.846 --> 38:26.182
What are you doing later?
Are you busy?

38:26.215 --> 38:28.450
Oh, man, you think...

38:28.483 --> 38:30.653
you think there's any chance
Butch Savage would do this movie?

38:30.686 --> 38:33.656
Butch Savage would be
the all-time win.

38:33.689 --> 38:39.862
Wide shot, medium, close-up,
extreme close-up.

38:39.896 --> 38:43.498
When you look back and you see
only one set of footprints,

38:43.531 --> 38:47.435
my astronaut,
that is when I carried you.

38:49.504 --> 38:50.206
It's good.

38:50.239 --> 38:51.607
It's really good.

38:51.641 --> 38:52.909
Yeah.

38:52.942 --> 38:54.143
Do you think it's epic enough?

38:54.176 --> 38:55.543
I mean, it's pretty epic.

38:56.846 --> 38:58.147
What else?
What else could go in there?

39:12.094 --> 39:15.197
I asked for a fucking God wig.
This is like Gandalf.

39:17.633 --> 39:19.735
I think we got to get an actor,
man.

39:19.769 --> 39:21.737
You think we try Stallone,
Chuck Norris?

39:21.771 --> 39:25.074
We could get...
we could get Butch Savage.

39:25.107 --> 39:26.642
Butch Savage.

39:26.676 --> 39:28.510
Motherfucker won't last a day
in Iraq.

39:28.543 --> 39:32.682
Well, you know, I actually heard
that Butch Savage is Born Again.

39:32.715 --> 39:34.150
- Oh, no way.
- Mm-hm.

39:34.183 --> 39:37.086
Look... look what just came up
on the Google!

39:37.119 --> 39:41.157
It's a Butch Savage commercial
about the church.

39:41.190 --> 39:42.959
- Did he just say the Google?
- He did, yeah.

39:46.896 --> 39:49.665
I'm Butch Savage
and I like to pray.

39:49.699 --> 39:54.136
Where? Costa Mesa,
Grace Bible Church of the Most High,

39:54.170 --> 39:57.173
where we are getting jacked
for Jesus,

39:57.206 --> 40:02.745
shredded for Solomon,
absolutely abdominal for Abraham.

40:02.778 --> 40:05.681
Chicken for Christ.

40:05.715 --> 40:07.817
Mm. Both powerful.

40:07.850 --> 40:10.953
I choose this.

40:14.023 --> 40:15.157
Holy shit.

40:16.058 --> 40:17.893
I'm gonna call. We gotta call.

40:21.664 --> 40:24.300
<i>Grace Bible Church of the Most
High reflecting God's love since 1964.</i>

40:24.333 --> 40:28.570
Yeah, hi.
Uh, is Butch Savage there?

40:28.604 --> 40:31.640
<i>Butch Savage?</i>
<i>Why would he be here right now?</i>

40:31.674 --> 40:33.909
We're doing
a Christian movie, uh,

40:33.943 --> 40:37.613
and we'd love to cast Butch
in the role of God.

40:37.646 --> 40:41.083
<i>Well, this is his
church, not his agent.</i>

40:41.117 --> 40:43.886
I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear.
This is a...

40:43.919 --> 40:47.189
It's an independent film, we're funding
it mainly out of pocket but we were...

40:50.893 --> 40:52.161
She hung up.

40:52.194 --> 40:53.996
Dude,
we got to get Butch Savage.

41:00.302 --> 41:03.239
Hey, I'm calling because I saw
that you worked with Butch Savage.

41:03.272 --> 41:05.573
I'm trying to get
his phone number.

41:05.608 --> 41:07.943
I'm just no good at
asking people for money, you know.

41:07.977 --> 41:09.945
I know, but I run the announcements so
we can do an offering there to fund it.

41:09.979 --> 41:12.081
I'm telling you,
everyone would be really excited about it.

41:12.114 --> 41:14.150
- Do you mean like in the main service?
- Yeah.

41:15.251 --> 41:16.252
Stick with me.

41:16.285 --> 41:18.120
- That's crazy.
- I know.

41:18.154 --> 41:19.822
So, when I'm doing
yogurt, I like to put as many...

41:19.855 --> 41:21.757
Son of a bitch.

41:21.791 --> 41:22.858
No, not you.

41:23.926 --> 41:25.928
Mr. Perfect. Mr. Perfect.

41:29.231 --> 41:33.202
Evidently, preachers and bartenders
have a lot more in common than you may think.

41:33.235 --> 41:38.808
Why? Because if they both do their job
right, they're making at least 10 percent.

41:38.841 --> 41:40.242
- Hello, Elevate.
- So, what we're gonna do

41:40.276 --> 41:41.811
is take a little bit of that
preacher tip,

41:41.844 --> 41:44.046
put it in the prayer
and space pocket.

41:44.080 --> 41:47.716
Before you guys leave today, I want
to share a very special video with you

41:47.750 --> 41:51.921
from two of our newest members,
Luke and Tanner.

41:51.954 --> 41:53.089
Enjoy.

41:56.659 --> 42:02.231
<i>This is Houston Contact
with a test One, two, three, four...</i>

42:05.101 --> 42:10.239
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

42:14.810 --> 42:17.913
Troy, what the itchy double hockey
sticks is this? Turn that off.

42:31.127 --> 42:33.863
<i>When you see</i>
<i>only one set of footprints,</i>

42:33.896 --> 42:37.766
<i>it was then my astronaut
I carried.</i>

42:46.108 --> 42:50.880
Christian movies are a great way
to impact the world

42:50.913 --> 42:53.315
and they're also very lucrative.

42:53.349 --> 42:58.888
Now, obviously,
all of us have eternal security

42:58.921 --> 43:02.858
but financial security
is also very important.

43:03.792 --> 43:08.397
We've been working really hard on a
story about an astronaut who finds God

43:08.430 --> 43:12.902
only after being pushed
to her limits by desperation.

43:12.935 --> 43:13.936
And space monsters.

43:15.337 --> 43:18.474
Um, we've started the casting
process, which is a little tricky,

43:18.507 --> 43:20.743
we want to get the right actors
for the right roles.

43:20.776 --> 43:24.413
Ladies and gentlemen,
in the role of God,

43:24.446 --> 43:29.852
I present to you Butch Savage.

43:35.824 --> 43:39.862
I have to be honest right now
with myself.

43:41.063 --> 43:45.801
We don't exactly 100 percent
have Butch Savage.

43:46.835 --> 43:50.439
So... so to make this movie,
which could impact the lives of millions,

43:50.472 --> 43:53.475
we're going to take up
an offering today.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.744
So, let's make it a reality.

43:55.778 --> 43:58.080
There's two offering buckets
upfront, if you're feeling generous.

43:58.113 --> 43:59.215
We really appreciate it.

43:59.248 --> 44:00.950
Have a wonderful Sunday.

44:04.019 --> 44:05.721
Dude, you got Butch Savage?

44:07.122 --> 44:10.426
Luke got Butch Savage.
Oh, my gosh. I am so excited.

44:10.459 --> 44:13.062
Butch Savage has been my
favorite actor since I was a kid.

44:15.497 --> 44:16.799
Luke's my best friend.

44:41.290 --> 44:43.525
Do you know
how you're actually gonna...

44:43.559 --> 44:45.894
Yeah, I'm thinking like Jessica
Chastain, Matt Damon in the Martian

44:45.928 --> 44:48.097
but not Jessica Chastain and Matt
Damon in <i>Interstellar</i>. You know?

44:48.130 --> 44:49.565
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

44:49.599 --> 44:51.900
- Yeah. I like it.
- Yeah.

44:51.934 --> 44:52.401
- You want to... you want to run it?
- Let's do it.

44:52.434 --> 44:53.769
Okay.

45:00.576 --> 45:03.345
I think we overdid it
with the green screen suits.

45:03.379 --> 45:05.214
What?

45:05.247 --> 45:06.815
No way. All these people walking
around, you got to be safe.

45:07.549 --> 45:12.221
A Prayer in Space,
day one could not be going better.

45:12.254 --> 45:14.857
We're talking
green screen suits.

45:14.890 --> 45:17.526
These things fit
like a fucking glove.

45:17.559 --> 45:19.094
I look like an Avenger.

45:19.128 --> 45:21.563
Let's try one. Let's... let's get one
of these going. Astronaut, you ready?

45:21.598 --> 45:22.531
Yeah.

45:22.564 --> 45:24.199
Get in there.

45:24.233 --> 45:27.536
Uh, camera's spinning.
Sound, how we feeling?

45:27.569 --> 45:29.405
Sound is feeding.

45:29.438 --> 45:32.374
The movie's great,
the script's great, Tanner's great

45:32.408 --> 45:36.579
and, you know, it's hard to make something
bad that's about God and praising Him.

45:36.613 --> 45:39.214
And I'm excited
for everyone to see it.

45:39.248 --> 45:43.118
- Ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-ro-row your boat.
- Action!

45:43.152 --> 45:44.253
Do I sound like a director?

45:46.221 --> 45:47.356
Cut!

45:47.389 --> 45:49.992
Moving on. Action!

45:50.025 --> 45:52.961
Action!

45:52.995 --> 45:54.363
All right.

45:55.297 --> 45:56.932
Action, astronaut!

45:58.100 --> 46:02.004
Hey, Mom, we're finally here.

46:02.037 --> 46:03.072
On Mars?

46:03.105 --> 46:05.507
Yeah, Mom, on Mars.

46:05.541 --> 46:08.010
It's pretty scary.

46:08.043 --> 46:15.084
Always remember, if you're ever
feeling alone or end up actually alone on Mars,

46:15.117 --> 46:17.219
God is always with you.

46:17.252 --> 46:19.555
Come on, Mom,
I am a scientist now.

46:19.589 --> 46:21.557
I'm not allowed
to believe in God anymore.

46:22.991 --> 46:23.992
And cut!

46:24.026 --> 46:25.060
Fucking perfect.

46:27.563 --> 46:29.098
Stinking perfect.

46:30.999 --> 46:32.401
- That was really good.
- Felt good.

46:32.434 --> 46:33.502
- Yeah, yeah.
- That one felt good.

46:33.535 --> 46:35.170
Yes.

46:35.204 --> 46:37.005
We're saving Butch Savage
to the end, right?

46:37.039 --> 46:39.541
Oh, yeah, last day.

46:39.575 --> 46:41.510
Gives us time to really
grease the wheels.

46:43.946 --> 46:47.449
I, honestly, have no idea
if he's gonna show up at all.

46:47.483 --> 46:50.587
I... I've left close
to a hundred messages.

46:50.620 --> 46:52.321
Nicky Steele says...

46:52.354 --> 46:56.392
The only thing standing
between you and your dreams

46:56.425 --> 47:00.462
is you and your dreams.

47:02.398 --> 47:04.333
Action, astronaut!

47:06.168 --> 47:09.271
Mom, the crew is gone.

47:09.304 --> 47:10.572
All of them.

47:10.607 --> 47:11.940
You're alone?

47:11.974 --> 47:15.144
I'm alone, Mom, on Mars.

47:25.287 --> 47:28.725
Oh, don't be scared,
it's just me Herman.

47:28.758 --> 47:30.559
And I'm having a great time.

47:33.529 --> 47:35.164
Did you see that space monster?

47:36.131 --> 47:39.001
Uh...

47:39.034 --> 47:40.703
- Uh, back to one.
- Okay.

47:40.737 --> 47:45.107
Ah, the only reason
that I'm here, it's Tanner.

47:45.140 --> 47:49.178
I don't know, I guess I...
I felt bad for them.

47:50.780 --> 47:55.585
Okay, I'm gonna go back
in there, pretend like I care.

48:02.592 --> 48:05.461
So, that was her crying out.

48:05.494 --> 48:09.364
Now we've just got God
coming through the heavens.

48:09.398 --> 48:12.201
- And the explosion.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

48:12.234 --> 48:14.102
What do you think
he likes to be called?

48:15.170 --> 48:18.173
BS, the Savage.

48:18.207 --> 48:21.611
I think, it's probably
just Butch, you know.

48:21.644 --> 48:25.113
Anyway, stop worrying, okay.

48:25.147 --> 48:28.283
Butch is gonna show up
and he's going to crush it.

48:28.317 --> 48:30.152
Okay,
this guy's a pro, you know.

48:30.185 --> 48:32.421
It's what pros do. I'm positive.

48:35.123 --> 48:37.459
I got a missed call
from the old lady.

48:37.493 --> 48:40.028
I was hoping
it was about Butch Savage.

48:40.062 --> 48:43.700
But the voicemail just said,
"Is my prescription ready?"

48:44.667 --> 48:47.236
I don't know what that means.

48:47.269 --> 48:49.538
That's a wrap
on week one, everybody.

48:49.571 --> 48:51.608
Let's go to bingo.

48:51.641 --> 48:55.544
Hey, jungle monster, I don't
think you have a balanced diet.

48:59.314 --> 49:01.517
<i>You needed more lead.</i>

49:01.550 --> 49:05.053
All right, first pull
out of the soup shoot, pay attention.

49:05.087 --> 49:09.626
We got B-6, 6, 6.

49:12.729 --> 49:14.697
Hail Satan.

49:14.731 --> 49:16.498
Dude, where's Tanner?

49:17.466 --> 49:19.201
I'm sure he's on his way.

49:22.337 --> 49:25.708
Yeah, so it's just G, C, D,
you're throwing some lyrics

49:25.742 --> 49:28.778
about God equals nature
type stuff, everybody cries.

49:28.811 --> 49:30.813
- Yeah. Cool.
- Yeah.

49:30.847 --> 49:32.414
All right,
you want to play some tunes?

49:32.447 --> 49:33.683
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

49:34.617 --> 49:35.818
Maybe let's pray first.

49:35.852 --> 49:36.753
Okay.

49:49.398 --> 49:50.299
All right.

49:52.434 --> 49:53.770
Cool.

49:53.803 --> 49:56.171
So, the entire crew
goes into the cave

49:56.204 --> 49:58.808
- but only the astronaut comes out.
- Okay.

49:58.841 --> 50:00.576
And then we...

50:00.610 --> 50:03.111
Hey, man, uh, I was talking
with some of the crew

50:03.145 --> 50:06.415
and, uh, we've got some, uh,
some notes for the script.

50:06.448 --> 50:08.585
You asked for notes?

50:08.618 --> 50:11.253
Well, I mean Hoyt was talking about
the astronaut's arc and how...

50:11.286 --> 50:14.222
Yes, the astronaut's arc is one
of the best aspects of the film.

50:14.256 --> 50:16.793
But what if she reconnects with her
mom right before the space mons...

50:16.826 --> 50:18.427
We're good on notes, guy.

50:20.228 --> 50:22.130
Actually, dude,
Hoyt writes on a FOX show.

50:22.164 --> 50:24.499
He's got some really great ideas
to make this thing pop.

50:24.533 --> 50:28.605
I think <i>A Prayer in Space</i> is
just the beginning for Tanner.

50:28.638 --> 50:30.707
I think this is really
just gonna be a...

50:30.740 --> 50:33.876
a launching pad for him,
you know, into space.

50:36.244 --> 50:38.881
Dude, we have to stick
to the original vision

50:38.915 --> 50:41.249
or this whole thing
could go off the rails.

50:41.283 --> 50:44.286
And between you and I,
Hoyt is weirding me out.

50:45.788 --> 50:48.156
Hoyt is trying to help us.

50:48.190 --> 50:49.324
That's what we have Herman for.

50:51.961 --> 50:53.295
That's what we have Tiffany for.

50:53.328 --> 50:55.665
Um-um, don't bring me into this.

50:55.698 --> 50:58.567
Actually, Tanner, I've been meaning to
bring up the whole bar crew situation.

50:59.636 --> 51:02.404
Look, I only have
two goals in life,

51:02.437 --> 51:06.809
that's to make the best Christian movie
that's ever been made and to marry Brandy.

51:07.944 --> 51:10.145
Dude, Brandy is never going to.

51:13.248 --> 51:14.149
Never mind.

51:19.554 --> 51:20.923
Can you believe that shit?

51:20.957 --> 51:22.424
I've never said Luke is right
about anything

51:22.457 --> 51:24.694
but I gotta tell ya,
Luke is right.

51:24.727 --> 51:26.963
Hoyt, mm-hmm, not to be trusted.

51:26.996 --> 51:29.564
They don't blink,
none of them, they just...

51:46.716 --> 51:51.788
No, no, no, nobody goes inside
without wearing one of these.

51:51.821 --> 51:53.388
Excuse me?

51:53.422 --> 51:55.625
It doesn't make any sense
to me either.

51:55.658 --> 51:59.394
No, no, no, no, young
lady, I am not putting that on.

52:08.838 --> 52:14.977
Okay, so, uh, why don't you just wait
right here and, um, I'll go and get them.

52:15.011 --> 52:16.913
Luke, Tanner.

52:21.984 --> 52:24.654
- Pastor Mike.
- Hey, boys, happy last day.

52:24.687 --> 52:26.388
Hey.

52:26.421 --> 52:28.457
Yeah. Where's Butch Savage?
Can't wait to meet him.

52:28.490 --> 52:31.493
Uh, the Savage
is in his dressing room. Right?

52:32.595 --> 52:34.731
- Yeah, of course.
- Okay, okay.

52:34.764 --> 52:39.234
Oh, FYI, I saw one of your crew members
pouring alcohol into his coffee.

52:41.470 --> 52:43.538
Herman.

52:43.572 --> 52:45.440
Well, anyway, look, I...
I only have an hour and I wanted me Butch.

52:45.474 --> 52:46.876
And come on, it's time.

52:46.909 --> 52:47.910
- Before we do that...
- Let's go meet him.

52:47.944 --> 52:49.411
I've been waiting all day.

52:49.444 --> 52:50.980
- Okay, let's go.
- Come on.

53:01.356 --> 53:04.060
Hey, Butch Savage,
are you sleeping?

53:04.093 --> 53:07.395
My father is here.
He wants to meet you.

53:08.765 --> 53:10.800
Sorry, come back another time.

53:12.935 --> 53:14.837
What the fuck?

53:14.871 --> 53:19.809
Uh, Butch or...
or, uh, Mr. Savage, this is Pastor Mike.

53:19.842 --> 53:21.744
Our church funded
this little mission

53:21.778 --> 53:24.379
and, uh,
I'm such a big fan and all

53:24.412 --> 53:28.618
and well, I was just wondering, I would love
to come in and just say a little quick hello.

53:28.651 --> 53:29.919
Just a minute.

53:29.952 --> 53:31.621
I'm doing Savage sit-ups.

53:31.654 --> 53:33.555
Something's off.

53:33.589 --> 53:35.925
Something's off my butt.

53:41.898 --> 53:43.032
Busted.

53:43.065 --> 53:45.400
Oh, I knew it.

53:45.433 --> 53:46.869
It's not that, Dad.

53:46.903 --> 53:48.537
It's just not clear
from the agent.

53:48.570 --> 53:50.372
Uh, he's got the whole day
to show up.

53:50.405 --> 53:52.975
Oh, Luke, I am ashamed.
How could you, son.

53:53.009 --> 53:54.911
You know we can't afford
to be just donating money.

53:54.944 --> 53:56.846
I'm sorry but I'm gonna have
to shut this down.

54:00.049 --> 54:04.020
Dad, it's the last day.
We can still finish.

54:04.053 --> 54:10.793
Look, I can play God or Jesus,

54:10.827 --> 54:15.497
the prodigal son that's come down
from heaven to fix all the problems.

54:21.536 --> 54:25.407
Ladies and gentlemen, my son...

54:27.043 --> 54:32.380
Well, I'm guessing he convinced you
all to be part of this little movie

54:32.414 --> 54:35.985
by promising something
he clearly could not deliver.

54:36.018 --> 54:38.588
I'm sorry you've all wasted
your time.

54:40.488 --> 54:43.425
But the movie is cancelled.

54:55.838 --> 55:01.077
Tanner, thank you
for being so nice to my son.

55:01.110 --> 55:07.683
But you might want to consider getting
yourself some more trustworthy friends.

55:19.461 --> 55:22.497
Some people
just never seem to change.

55:34.243 --> 55:35.144
Fuck.

55:37.079 --> 55:39.749
I need a drink. No Bar?

55:41.784 --> 55:43.185
We were so close to finishing.

55:44.220 --> 55:46.454
We can still finish, man.

55:46.488 --> 55:48.523
Your dad just canceled us.

55:48.556 --> 55:51.127
I can't believe you didn't get Butch.
You told me you got Butch.

55:52.228 --> 55:56.032
I just know how much you love
him, okay, all the marathons.

55:57.166 --> 55:58.601
I didn't want to disappoint you.

55:59.669 --> 56:03.205
Luke, we're supposed
to be teammates.

56:04.173 --> 56:07.643
Teammates have to communicate in order
to work. There's no lying in team.

56:09.111 --> 56:11.781
Besides, I could use a break.

56:15.851 --> 56:17.954
What does Nicky Steele
have to say about this one?

56:25.728 --> 56:30.532
Hey, at least there's one
good thing left in the world.

56:30.565 --> 56:31.634
You want to go get a drink?

56:33.035 --> 56:35.537
Thanks, Luke.

56:35.570 --> 56:37.773
Now that the shoot is canceled, I guess
I have to go back to my other projects.

57:19.815 --> 57:21.549
We don't wake up this early.

57:21.584 --> 57:22.885
Mr. Perfect heard you.

57:24.153 --> 57:27.223
I told you, this is the only
time I could help you move.

57:27.256 --> 57:31.293
You're helping a buddy move or you're leading
a meeting of the Dead Poets Society.

57:37.666 --> 57:39.602
Why are you being so weird?

57:46.075 --> 57:47.843
Come on, Mr. Perfect.

57:47.877 --> 57:49.812
Let's see what daddy number two
is really doing.

57:55.951 --> 57:57.853
What the fuck?

58:01.390 --> 58:05.928
This is the address
but I don't see a moving truck.

58:05.961 --> 58:06.862
Do you?

58:20.876 --> 58:22.978
Okay, so then he says,

58:23.012 --> 58:26.215
"Hey, silly boy, I think
your fish put on a few pounds."

58:30.119 --> 58:31.020
I get it.

58:40.729 --> 58:42.598
What the hell is going on?

58:43.866 --> 58:46.268
Sorry, friend, I think
you're in the wrong abode.

58:46.302 --> 58:48.404
I'm at the right abode all right
,funny guy.

58:48.437 --> 58:52.808
Tanner,
what the fuck is this shit, man?

58:52.842 --> 58:56.846
Uh, guys, I... I am very sorry.

58:56.879 --> 58:58.214
Can we talk about this outside?

58:59.148 --> 59:01.684
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

59:05.054 --> 59:08.824
Luke, I joined a small group that some of
the younger people from the church hosts.

59:08.858 --> 59:11.227
What the fuck is a small group, man?
They didn't look small.

59:11.260 --> 59:12.895
They looked fucking
normal size to me.

59:12.928 --> 59:15.064
No, it's...

59:15.097 --> 59:17.967
Look, it's just a smaller gathering
than the Sunday service, okay?

59:18.000 --> 59:21.937
We get together, we talk about life, uh,
we help each other out, it's awesome.

59:23.839 --> 59:25.274
This is officially the only
thing worse than CrossFit, man.

59:26.942 --> 59:28.911
All right, look, man,
I wanted to invite you

59:30.346 --> 59:33.782
but I don't know with your dad and
stuff, you clearly hate this.

59:34.984 --> 59:36.018
My dad.

59:38.721 --> 59:39.755
Fuck you, man.

59:47.296 --> 59:49.298
Come on, Jolene, not now.

59:49.331 --> 59:51.100
Not now.

59:51.133 --> 59:53.435
The battery life
on these things is just...

59:58.908 --> 1:00:00.743
Are you okay?

1:00:00.776 --> 1:00:02.411
I'm fucking fine.

1:00:02.444 --> 1:00:04.713
Mr. Perfect and I
have never been better.

1:00:16.492 --> 1:00:20.462
Uh, I'm sorry, guys.

1:00:20.496 --> 1:00:22.865
Yeah, I thought we were getting
robbed or something.

1:00:22.898 --> 1:00:24.800
It's kind of weird.
I've never seen him like that.

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:26.135
Let's lighten the mood.

1:00:26.168 --> 1:00:28.037
All right,
let's get back to Romans.

1:00:30.172 --> 1:00:33.075
"The result was that their foolish
minds became dark and confused.

1:00:33.108 --> 1:00:34.977
Claiming themselves
to be wise without God,

1:00:35.010 --> 1:00:37.012
they became utter fools,
instead.

1:00:37.046 --> 1:00:40.816
And then, instead of worshiping
the glorious, ever-living God,

1:00:40.849 --> 1:00:44.053
they took wood and stone and
made idols for themselves."

1:01:13.816 --> 1:01:15.117
No way!

1:01:31.867 --> 1:01:34.470
So really,
I just wanted you two to meet.

1:01:34.503 --> 1:01:37.273
Tanner here is one
of the funniest guys I know.

1:01:37.306 --> 1:01:40.509
He's an actor,
a writer, director.

1:01:40.542 --> 1:01:42.144
He's a creator.

1:01:42.177 --> 1:01:44.346
Well, you guys know
it's a tough business

1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:47.283
but I got the feeling
that you guys are even tougher.

1:02:17.913 --> 1:02:21.116
So, what are you thinking
like comedy, drama?

1:02:21.150 --> 1:02:25.554
Oh, um, is it too soon
to reboot <i>Two and a Half Men</i>?

1:02:25.588 --> 1:02:29.358
Yeah, like a... like a really
intelligent poignant comedy.

1:02:45.908 --> 1:02:50.179
All right,
and next fall we got Dirty 30.

1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:53.650
Dirty 30, I-30.

1:02:53.683 --> 1:02:56.985
Bingo!

1:02:59.054 --> 1:03:00.356
Proud of you, buddy.

1:04:17.299 --> 1:04:21.103
Make sure you get at the micro fungus.
It hides in the cracks.

1:04:21.136 --> 1:04:23.505
It's sneaky.
But that's the good stuff.

1:04:33.583 --> 1:04:35.083
I tied up the hose
the way you like.

1:04:35.117 --> 1:04:36.686
You still going over
to Riverside?

1:04:36.719 --> 1:04:38.420
No.

1:04:38.454 --> 1:04:39.354
Come here.

1:04:40.255 --> 1:04:41.156
Come here.

1:04:42.625 --> 1:04:46.228
Where I'm about to send you
is a gift.

1:04:46.261 --> 1:04:50.098
A gift given to you by me,
Jimmy.

1:04:51.066 --> 1:04:53.435
And it's one
that will change your life.

1:04:53.469 --> 1:04:57.339
This, my young friend,
is my best customer.

1:04:57.372 --> 1:04:59.676
Traditionally,
I'd handle it myself

1:04:59.709 --> 1:05:03.580
but my daughter is up for <i>American
Ninja Warrior</i> teen edition

1:05:03.613 --> 1:05:06.315
and I want to be able
to give her my good juju.

1:05:06.348 --> 1:05:09.351
Yeah, okay, cool.
It's no problem.

1:05:09.384 --> 1:05:12.755
"Yeah. Okay, cool. No problem."

1:05:13.690 --> 1:05:16.458
No, that's not gonna cut it.

1:05:16.492 --> 1:05:18.327
I need this man's pool
to sparkle.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:21.263
I need it to look like a bee
has never died in it.

1:05:21.296 --> 1:05:25.635
I need it to look like not one
kid has ever taken the tugboat

1:05:25.668 --> 1:05:28.437
to brown town
in the shallow end.

1:05:28.470 --> 1:05:30.640
I need it to look like
the Olympics.

1:05:30.673 --> 1:05:33.141
And I'm not talking about the shitty
ones that took place in Russia

1:05:33.175 --> 1:05:35.143
where they killed all the dogs.
No.

1:05:36.746 --> 1:05:41.818
I am talking about
motherfucking Sydney.

1:05:41.851 --> 1:05:44.587
Okay, I'm on it.

1:05:44.621 --> 1:05:45.521
My man.

1:05:53.663 --> 1:05:56.565
That last meeting, you killed it in there.
You know that.

1:05:56.599 --> 1:05:59.101
I...
I feel like it went really well.

1:05:59.134 --> 1:06:03.171
And these new head shots,
they look great. You look great.

1:06:04.841 --> 1:06:07.476
You're gonna be on a show
in no time. I know it.

1:06:07.509 --> 1:06:10.412
Dude, thank you so much,
um, honestly, I...

1:06:10.445 --> 1:06:13.215
I... I've never felt so good
about the way things are moving.

1:06:13.248 --> 1:06:14.784
You don't have to thank me.

1:06:14.817 --> 1:06:18.287
If anything, I...
I appreciate what we have here.

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.690
It's been really great spending
so much time with you.

1:06:20.723 --> 1:06:22.558
Yeah.

1:06:22.592 --> 1:06:24.661
Um, well you know, fingers
crossed, it all works out.

1:06:26.161 --> 1:06:28.463
I truly think God
put you in my life for a reason.

1:06:29.799 --> 1:06:30.700
God is good.

1:06:39.709 --> 1:06:41.844
Oh, okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:46.481
Hoyt,
you know about me and Lisa.

1:06:48.918 --> 1:06:51.654
I, uh, I guess I...
I misread something.

1:06:52.655 --> 1:06:54.156
You know, it's fine.

1:06:54.189 --> 1:06:56.458
Let's just forget
it ever happened.

1:06:56.491 --> 1:06:58.293
Let's go grab a bite.

1:06:59.328 --> 1:07:00.228
Hoyt, I'm...

1:07:01.731 --> 1:07:02.632
I'm gonna go.

1:07:08.938 --> 1:07:10.773
You know, you look like, um,

1:07:14.209 --> 1:07:17.346
You look like a really handsome
version of Owen Wilson.

1:08:08.998 --> 1:08:10.265
Welcome, friend.

1:08:27.850 --> 1:08:30.285
I'm so glad you decided
to join us.

1:08:30.318 --> 1:08:33.288
You know, when you hold
these kinds of parties...

1:08:34.724 --> 1:08:37.727
...sometimes,
only the weirdos show up.

1:08:39.294 --> 1:08:40.930
I'm actually here
to clean the pool.

1:08:42.965 --> 1:08:44.667
My God

1:08:46.535 --> 1:08:52.274
So wrong of me to assume
you were part of the lifestyle.

1:08:54.911 --> 1:08:56.879
Well, welcome.

1:08:56.913 --> 1:08:59.682
Ah, the Roman bath
could really use some scrubbing.

1:09:04.352 --> 1:09:05.353
Hey, I gotta ask.

1:09:06.923 --> 1:09:09.257
You're Nicky Steele, aren't you?

1:09:11.661 --> 1:09:12.995
Why are you following me?

1:09:13.029 --> 1:09:14.764
Who do you work for, fucker?

1:09:14.797 --> 1:09:17.532
CIA? IRS? Yelp?

1:09:17.566 --> 1:09:20.302
Oh, I actually work for you.

1:09:21.536 --> 1:09:22.739
Sales.

1:09:24.006 --> 1:09:28.845
Oh. Shit.
Hey, guy, you got to speak up.

1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:31.948
What do you know
about the yo-yo?

1:09:31.981 --> 1:09:34.751
Not much, I guess.

1:09:34.784 --> 1:09:38.453
Then I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

1:09:38.487 --> 1:09:43.793
The key to success is the yo-yo.

1:09:43.826 --> 1:09:46.696
Check it.
It goes down, it goes up.

1:09:46.729 --> 1:09:52.702
It can walk the dog.
It can go around the world.

1:09:52.735 --> 1:09:58.975
But at the end of the day, it always
rises back up to its little blue home.

1:09:59.008 --> 1:10:01.844
Now,
you being a fine tea salesman,

1:10:01.878 --> 1:10:04.847
you spend your days talking about
tea, talking about weight loss,

1:10:04.881 --> 1:10:08.584
but you do it,
so that at the end of the day,

1:10:08.618 --> 1:10:11.386
you can go
to your little blue home.

1:10:12.588 --> 1:10:18.326
Now you keep at it and one day,
that home is going to look just like this.

1:10:23.065 --> 1:10:26.368
What a relief.

1:10:28.137 --> 1:10:29.772
Man, I didn't know
what to expect.

1:10:29.806 --> 1:10:31.707
I walk in, I get kicked
in the balls, you know,

1:10:31.741 --> 1:10:36.879
but is there anything you could
give me to increase my sales?

1:10:39.381 --> 1:10:42.384
Well, yes.

1:10:45.154 --> 1:10:47.824
It's all about recruitment.

1:10:47.857 --> 1:10:51.627
Selling the tea is for suckers.
You got to sell the sellers. Check it.

1:10:51.661 --> 1:10:54.597
You sell bucks worth of tea,
what do you get?

1:10:54.630 --> 1:10:56.431
- Five bucks?
- 250.

1:10:56.464 --> 1:10:57.800
Jesus Christ.

1:11:00.069 --> 1:11:06.142
Okay, 250. Now, let's say, you recruit
your buddy and he sells 50 bucks,

1:11:06.175 --> 1:11:11.147
you get a buck and a quarter
for doing nothing, all right?

1:11:11.180 --> 1:11:15.017
Plus, you make money on the
inventory you have to sell him.

1:11:15.051 --> 1:11:19.021
You get money from him twice.

1:11:19.055 --> 1:11:21.356
So it really is
a pyramid scheme?

1:11:24.459 --> 1:11:28.831
Pyramids are great, guy,
if you're on top.

1:11:32.467 --> 1:11:38.107
You want to take a real little peek
into the Nicky Steele crystal ball?

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:47.149
You want to see what the future of
entrepreneurial sales is really like?

1:11:47.183 --> 1:11:48.550
Do you?

1:11:48.584 --> 1:11:49.919
- Do you?
- Yeah.

1:11:49.952 --> 1:11:50.953
Yeah.

1:11:55.925 --> 1:12:00.830
Shazam, the Amish.

1:12:00.863 --> 1:12:02.798
Any questions?

1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:05.868
Yes.

1:12:06.869 --> 1:12:09.705
So, the... the future
of entrepreneurial sales

1:12:09.739 --> 1:12:13.009
is the one group of people that
doesn't believe in technology?

1:12:15.945 --> 1:12:21.651
These guys can't do shit,
they can't smoke, they can't get high,

1:12:21.684 --> 1:12:24.654
they can't get drunk,
they can't see tits,

1:12:24.687 --> 1:12:31.060
except for one year when they
turn and they go on Rumspringa.

1:12:31.093 --> 1:12:34.830
And these bad boys
are ready to burst.

1:12:34.864 --> 1:12:39.702
Now who do you think the first
person they see is going to be?

1:12:41.503 --> 1:12:43.039
You?

1:12:43.072 --> 1:12:43.973
No.

1:12:45.207 --> 1:12:47.143
You.

1:12:47.176 --> 1:12:50.146
The minute they step off
the compound,

1:12:50.179 --> 1:12:57.552
the first person they're gonna
see is you and you have got a kit.

1:12:57.586 --> 1:13:02.557
Five hundred bucks buys them
a bottle of Nicky Steele vodka,

1:13:02.591 --> 1:13:04.559
a carton
of Nicky Steele cigarettes,

1:13:04.593 --> 1:13:08.664
a genuine certified
Nicky Steele vape pen.

1:13:08.698 --> 1:13:11.000
Oh, Chihuahua.

1:13:11.033 --> 1:13:14.937
And a coupon for 30 minutes
with Destiny.

1:13:15.871 --> 1:13:18.274
Not that these bad boys
are gonna need 30 minutes.

1:13:18.307 --> 1:13:20.910
It's gonna be the quickest
25 dollars she ever made.

1:13:24.847 --> 1:13:30.920
So, the future is swindling the
Amish, making readymade Rumspringa's?

1:13:32.822 --> 1:13:34.857
Readymade Rumspringa.

1:13:37.126 --> 1:13:41.030
Readymade Rumspringa.

1:13:42.031 --> 1:13:44.633
Fuck me.

1:13:46.268 --> 1:13:48.871
Would you just sign that?

1:13:48.904 --> 1:13:52.742
Don't worry, I will photocopy your signature
onto a legal document at another time

1:13:52.775 --> 1:13:59.281
because you, my friend, have just
made yourself a fast one-y honey.

1:14:10.926 --> 1:14:12.828
Yeah.

1:14:12.862 --> 1:14:15.131
I'm going to need
the yo-yo back, too.

1:14:17.066 --> 1:14:18.701
Thank you.

1:14:44.260 --> 1:14:47.029
Hey, man, can... can we talk?

1:14:47.063 --> 1:14:48.230
It's been a weird
couple of weeks.

1:14:51.867 --> 1:14:54.036
Honestly,
aspects of it are great.

1:14:54.070 --> 1:14:58.841
You know, the, uh, community sense
of something bigger than yourself,

1:14:58.874 --> 1:15:03.045
it's like a, uh, healthier
less drunk version of the bar.

1:15:03.079 --> 1:15:05.948
Dude, I get it, man,
I grew up there.

1:15:05.981 --> 1:15:08.751
I think I'm less jaded
by the people than the religion.

1:15:08.784 --> 1:15:09.685
Hmm.

1:15:09.718 --> 1:15:11.153
Half of them babysat me.

1:15:12.188 --> 1:15:14.023
I do like how the people
at your dad's church don't

1:15:14.056 --> 1:15:16.025
try to pretend
like they know everything

1:15:16.058 --> 1:15:17.760
or try to shove it all down
my throat.

1:15:19.395 --> 1:15:24.967
Just the rules, you know, this idea of
being afraid to be who you really are.

1:15:29.805 --> 1:15:31.107
Hey, man, are we cool?

1:15:33.275 --> 1:15:34.210
We're cool.

1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:41.217
You look like the Lannister
that works at Urban Outfitters.

1:15:44.353 --> 1:15:47.790
You look like Sean Penn if you couldn't
change a tire and he had a nut allergy.

1:15:50.426 --> 1:15:51.994
Shit.

1:15:52.027 --> 1:15:53.162
Check it out.

1:15:53.195 --> 1:15:54.096
Yeah.

1:15:56.332 --> 1:15:58.367
Oh, yeah, okay.

1:16:07.109 --> 1:16:09.812
This might be our best one yet.

1:16:12.915 --> 1:16:14.884
Why did I have to be Khaleesi?

1:16:19.755 --> 1:16:20.723
Hello.

1:16:23.325 --> 1:16:24.260
Yeah.

1:16:25.494 --> 1:16:26.695
Are you serious?

1:16:28.230 --> 1:16:31.901
Well, no, no, exactly. What...
what role is bigger than God?

1:16:34.203 --> 1:16:35.871
Wow.

1:16:35.905 --> 1:16:37.773
Thank you so much.

1:16:37.806 --> 1:16:38.941
Yeah, thank you.

1:16:41.844 --> 1:16:42.745
We're back on.

1:16:45.381 --> 1:16:47.416
Thank you all so much

1:16:47.449 --> 1:16:53.422
for coming out to the last day
of filming <i>A Prayer in Space</i>.

1:16:53.455 --> 1:16:56.258
Now, you may
or may not believe in God,

1:16:56.292 --> 1:17:00.095
but it's clear
that you believe in us.

1:17:01.830 --> 1:17:06.335
Now, we all have our differences,
especially you and I, Hoyt,

1:17:08.270 --> 1:17:11.373
but there's one thing
that the church

1:17:11.407 --> 1:17:17.079
and the bars have in common,
that's community.

1:17:17.112 --> 1:17:20.783
So, let's come together
and crush this.

1:17:20.816 --> 1:17:23.152
Marlon, how are we looking
with the explosives?

1:17:23.185 --> 1:17:24.753
TNT, baby.

1:17:26.355 --> 1:17:28.457
The bad boys are straight out of 1991
and they're packing motherfucking heat.

1:17:28.490 --> 1:17:32.228
Great. We're gonna need to get
this shot off before he gets here.

1:17:32.261 --> 1:17:33.295
We've got an hour.

1:17:36.465 --> 1:17:37.866
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1:17:53.148 --> 1:17:55.217
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Space shot.

1:18:08.163 --> 1:18:11.267
- What's the frame for this per shot like kind of...
- Shh.

1:18:16.105 --> 1:18:20.109
I made a hot sexy mistake
with my best friend

1:18:20.142 --> 1:18:23.178
but this movie
is bigger than me.

1:18:23.212 --> 1:18:25.214
It's bigger than any of us.

1:18:25.247 --> 1:18:29.518
I mean it's, you know, so...

1:18:30.552 --> 1:18:32.955
He...
he called it a sexy mistake?

1:18:36.058 --> 1:18:37.493
I mean, that's a compliment.

1:18:37.526 --> 1:18:42.431
Okay, we're gonna need
all hands on deck.

1:18:42.464 --> 1:18:44.300
- You, too, Tiff.
- Hmm?

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:45.401
Get in there.

1:18:45.434 --> 1:18:46.935
- Oh,
- Need you in.

1:18:46.969 --> 1:18:47.870
Come on.

1:18:50.906 --> 1:18:52.574
Everybody in position.

1:18:54.943 --> 1:18:55.878
All right, here we go.

1:19:04.420 --> 1:19:06.255
Action, space monsters!

1:19:09.358 --> 1:19:12.261
And action, explosives!

1:19:24.273 --> 1:19:26.975
And action, explosives!

1:19:36.952 --> 1:19:39.088
I don't know what you want
from me, motherfuckers.

1:19:39.121 --> 1:19:41.156
This shit is like 30 years old.

1:19:48.097 --> 1:19:51.033
Okay, guys, it's fine,
just crop out the explosives

1:19:51.066 --> 1:19:52.401
and I'll add that in VFX.

1:19:52.434 --> 1:19:55.037
I can fix this whole thing
in the edit.

1:19:55.070 --> 1:19:56.205
You know how to edit?

1:19:56.238 --> 1:19:57.973
Uh, yeah, I'm an editor.

1:19:58.006 --> 1:20:00.442
Worked for Nat Geo,
Disney, Marvel.

1:20:00.476 --> 1:20:03.011
I mean,
I do all their digital content.

1:20:03.045 --> 1:20:04.513
What...
what did you guys think I did?

1:20:04.546 --> 1:20:08.283
- Oh.
- But I talk about it all the time.

1:20:08.317 --> 1:20:10.219
I'm so sorry.

1:20:13.989 --> 1:20:14.890
He's here.

1:20:25.534 --> 1:20:28.605
Oh, my gosh. Dude, that is so much fun.
You're totally right.

1:20:28.638 --> 1:20:30.539
- In the future, cars won't even exist.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:20:30.572 --> 1:20:33.208
wait, wait, wait, wait,
I've got another piece of big news.

1:20:33.242 --> 1:20:35.043
- To PR your backspot?
- Yes.

1:20:35.077 --> 1:20:38.180
Um, actually I...

1:20:38.213 --> 1:20:40.315
I think I'm gonna ask Lisa
to marry me.

1:20:40.349 --> 1:20:42.585
- No shit.
- Yeah.

1:20:42.619 --> 1:20:44.052
I'm happy for you, man.

1:20:44.086 --> 1:20:45.421
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Genuinely.

1:20:45.454 --> 1:20:48.056
Thank you.
Um, will you be my best man?

1:20:48.991 --> 1:20:51.226
Who else are you gonna ask?
Herman?

1:20:55.164 --> 1:20:56.365
Fair point.

1:20:56.398 --> 1:20:58.701
Hey, reps for Jesus, right?

1:20:58.735 --> 1:21:00.569
- Yeah?
- The shirts are perfect.

1:21:00.603 --> 1:21:01.604
Let's get in there.

1:21:07.509 --> 1:21:09.411
Are you ready for this?

1:21:09.445 --> 1:21:11.046
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:21:13.081 --> 1:21:14.316
We made a movie.

1:21:14.349 --> 1:21:15.384
We made a movie.

1:21:18.387 --> 1:21:20.690
Uh, Elevate Church,
thank you so much for coming.

1:21:20.723 --> 1:21:24.460
Uh, before we get started, Luke and I
just wanted to say a real quick thank you.

1:21:24.493 --> 1:21:28.130
Um, we put a lot of blood, sweat and
tears into this over the last few months

1:21:28.163 --> 1:21:30.432
and none of it would be possible
without you.

1:21:30.466 --> 1:21:31.634
So, thank you.
Thank you very much.

1:21:37.473 --> 1:21:40.342
And now, without further ado,

1:21:40.375 --> 1:21:45.080
the world premiere screening
of <i>A Prayer in Space</i>,

1:21:46.215 --> 1:21:52.020
the story of the first prayer
ever to be prayed in space.

1:21:52.054 --> 1:21:53.590
Enjoy the movie, everybody.

1:21:59.194 --> 1:22:02.297
<i>Hey, Mom, we're finally here.</i>

1:22:02.331 --> 1:22:03.733
<i>On Mars?</i>

1:22:03.766 --> 1:22:06.401
<i>Yeah, Mom, on Mars.</i>

1:22:07.503 --> 1:22:09.438
<i>It's pretty scary.</i>

1:22:09.471 --> 1:22:12.007
<i>Always remember,</i>
<i>if you're ever feeling alone</i>

1:22:12.842 --> 1:22:19.081
<i>or end up actually alone on
Mars, God is always with you.</i>

1:22:19.114 --> 1:22:22.217
<i>Come on, Mom,
you know I'm a scientist.</i>

1:22:22.251 --> 1:22:24.052
<i>I'm not allowed
to believe in God anymore.</i>

1:22:29.792 --> 1:22:33.228
<i>Mom, the crew is gone.</i>

1:22:34.263 --> 1:22:35.430
<i>All of them.</i>

1:22:36.733 --> 1:22:40.168
<i>I'm alone on Mars.</i>

1:22:44.273 --> 1:22:49.646
<i>Lord, save me
from these space monsters.</i>

1:23:06.261 --> 1:23:13.502
<i>Astronaut, you have come closer
to touching the hand of God</i>

1:23:13.535 --> 1:23:16.305
<i>than any other astronaut
before you.</i>

1:23:17.272 --> 1:23:24.179
<i>Leap up and use the lower gravitational
pull to fly yourself toward me.</i>

1:23:24.212 --> 1:23:27.850
<i>You are the first astronaut
to give a prayer in space</i>

1:23:27.884 --> 1:23:30.720
<i>and I have heard you
loud and clear.</i>

1:23:31.621 --> 1:23:36.726
<i>Heaven, the final,
final frontier.</i>

1:23:39.194 --> 1:23:40.429
<i>Boom.</i>

1:23:46.736 --> 1:23:53.141
<i>Mom, my body is coming back home
and my soul is coming back to Jesus.</i>

1:24:27.509 --> 1:24:31.914
With this check for one hundred
thousand dollars,

1:24:31.948 --> 1:24:35.652
you two have saved our mortgage
and our church.

1:24:35.685 --> 1:24:37.820
Now, I'll admit I had my doubts.

1:24:37.854 --> 1:24:43.593
But at the end of the day,
I will always invest in family.

1:24:43.626 --> 1:24:46.461
My dad, eventually, came around.

1:24:46.495 --> 1:24:49.231
In fact, he saved the movie.

1:24:49.264 --> 1:24:53.268
And even though we didn't get Butch
Savage, Christflix still bought it.

1:24:54.236 --> 1:24:56.438
I love you, Son.

1:24:56.471 --> 1:25:02.679
Now, I know we've had our differences,
but I am truly, truly proud of you.

1:25:03.713 --> 1:25:04.947
Love you.

1:25:08.483 --> 1:25:09.351
Thank you, Son.

1:25:10.620 --> 1:25:13.589
And to you,
our wonderful congregation,

1:25:13.623 --> 1:25:16.759
I am so glad
that you all felt the same way.

1:25:17.827 --> 1:25:21.430
Thank you for investing
in our church family.

1:25:21.463 --> 1:25:24.266
Now, we still desperately need
to fix that roof.

1:25:24.299 --> 1:25:27.637
So please, please pray
that we find the funds.

1:25:28.905 --> 1:25:33.542
But for now, what did you
all think of the film?

1:25:37.947 --> 1:25:40.482
<i>♪ There is a world up above us ♪</i>

1:25:40.515 --> 1:25:42.250
<i>♪ And man, it's pretty great ♪</i>

1:25:42.284 --> 1:25:44.386
<i>♪ Yeah, clouds and
golden walkways ♪</i>

1:25:44.419 --> 1:25:46.022
<i>♪ And around it
there's a gate ♪</i>

1:25:46.055 --> 1:25:48.323
<i>♪ But you got to ignore
The doorman ♪</i>

1:25:48.356 --> 1:25:50.026
<i>♪ If you wanna get inside ♪</i>

1:25:50.059 --> 1:25:53.228
<i>♪ 'Cause we got boots
On the ground in the sky ♪</i>

1:25:54.797 --> 1:25:57.299
Could I have used the 50 grand?

1:25:57.332 --> 1:25:58.601
Sure.

1:25:58.634 --> 1:26:00.803
But Jimmy gave me back
my pool gig.

1:26:00.837 --> 1:26:05.407
And my dad,
well, it's the least I could do.

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:06.876
Something else will come along.

1:26:10.813 --> 1:26:15.017
