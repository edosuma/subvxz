04:34.600 --> 04:36.500
SHE'LL DO ANYTHING
TO STOP IT,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.600
EVEN IF IT MEANS

10:37.433 --> 10:40.167
- NO, NO, NO,
I'M JUST TALKING TO ROBERT.

10:40.167 --> 10:41.667
- WHAT ARE YOU, BRAGGING?

10:41.667 --> 10:42.933
- WHAT?

10:42.933 --> 10:44.267
YEAH, ROBERT TOLD ME

10:44.267 --> 10:47.300
ABOUT YOU AND HAPPY HIPS
OVER THERE.

10:49.167 --> 10:51.767
- OH, GREAT.
THAT'S JUST GREAT, ROBERT.

10:51.767 --> 10:55.067
- IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO EARN SOME JEWELRY.

10:55.067 --> 10:57.600
[laughter]

10:57.600 --> 10:59.300
- LISTEN,
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

10:59.300 --> 11:02.267
BUT I THINK MAYBE
THIS MIGHT BE DEBRA'S WAY

11:02.267 --> 11:04.800
OF TRYING TO...COMPENSATE.

11:04.800 --> 11:06.433
- HOW SO, MA?

11:06.433 --> 11:09.600
- WELL, IF YOU CAN'T
COOK IN THE KITCHEN...

11:13.933 --> 11:15.867
- OKAY.
GOOD-BYE.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.767
- YOU GUYS ARE WAY OFF.

11:17.767 --> 11:18.800
THERE.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.067
- WHAT ARE YOU--

11:20.067 --> 11:23.233
- HOLY CRAP!

11:23.233 --> 11:25.200
- THAT'S DEBRA'S
AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.533
SHE WATCHES HIM
FLEX ALL AROUND,

11:26.533 --> 11:30.033
AND THEN SHE GOES HOME
ALL...INSPIRED.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.933
- WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

11:32.933 --> 11:35.300
WHY DO YOU TELL MOM AND DAD
THINGS LIKE THAT, HUH,

11:35.300 --> 11:39.533
MY PERSONAL THINGS?
WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.967
- BRINGS US CLOSER.

11:44.967 --> 11:47.200
- WHAT ARE YOU SO UPSET ABOUT?

11:47.200 --> 11:48.500
SOUNDS LIKE MR. MUSCLE HERE

11:48.500 --> 11:51.600
IS SAVING YOU
SOME PREP WORK.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.267
- I DON'T LIKE THAT,
FRANK.

11:53.267 --> 11:54.833
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
RAYMOND,

11:54.833 --> 11:58.500
I THINK THAT DEBRA IS PLAYING
A VERY DANGEROUS GAME.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.233
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:00.233 --> 12:01.733
WHO CARES WHERE
SHE GETS HER APPETITE

12:01.733 --> 12:04.167
AS LONG AS SHE HAS
HER MEAL AT HOME?

12:04.167 --> 12:05.667
- STOP.
STOP.

12:05.667 --> 12:06.967
- RAYMOND,

12:06.967 --> 12:09.567
YOU HAVE TO GET DEBRA
OUT OF THIS CLASS RIGHT NOW.

12:09.567 --> 12:12.133
- WHY?
THIS GUY IS HELPING OUT.

12:12.133 --> 12:13.433
MAYBE RAY DOESN'T
HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

12:13.433 --> 12:16.133
TO GET DEBRA'S
MOTOR RUNNING.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.867
- RAYMOND'S GOT PLENTY.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.133
- THANK YOU...

12:22.767 --> 12:25.167
MOM.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.633
UNH.

12:30.100 --> 12:32.300
- HUH.

12:32.300 --> 12:35.400
HEY, THIS IS
A GOOD-LOOKING GUY.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.133
WHAT?

12:38.133 --> 12:40.633
HE'S LIKE A GLADIATOR.

12:40.633 --> 12:41.967
COME ON, ROBERT,

12:41.967 --> 12:44.100
YOU CAN'T SAY
THIS ISN'T A HANDSOME MAN.

12:46.600 --> 12:50.633
- MA, PLEASE,
I REALLY NEED MY PANTS.

13:09.033 --> 13:10.300
- HEY.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.900
- HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

13:11.900 --> 13:14.033
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO PICK ME UP AT 2:00.

13:14.033 --> 13:15.333
- YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE

13:15.333 --> 13:16.700
WE COULD GO OUT
AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT.

13:16.700 --> 13:17.900
- OKAY, GREAT.

13:17.900 --> 13:19.433
BUT I'M GOING TO BE
ANOTHER 45 MINUTES.

13:19.433 --> 13:20.233
- WELL--

13:20.233 --> 13:21.467
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.533
all: HEY!

13:22.533 --> 13:23.867
- SO WHO'S READY TO SWEAT?

13:23.867 --> 13:25.633
- WHOO!
- ALL RIGHT!

13:31.933 --> 13:33.800
- LISTEN, I WAS THINKING
WE COULD GO TO TUTO BENES,

13:33.800 --> 13:35.200
YOU KNOW,
BUT I DON'T HAVE RESERVATIONS,

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
SO WHY DON'T WE
JUST GO NOW?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.600
- NAH. NO.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.533
- HI.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.767
ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE THE CLASS TODAY?

13:48.667 --> 13:50.600
- MAYBE.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.367
- [laughing]
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:53.367 --> 13:54.500
- WELL, THERE'S
AN EXTRA SPACE

13:54.500 --> 13:56.067
IN CASE YOU DECIDE
TO STAY.

13:56.067 --> 14:00.600
- HMM.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.900
- RAY,
YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE CLASS.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.600
- MAYBE I WILL.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.033
WHY?
WOULD THAT RUIN IT FOR YOU?

14:06.033 --> 14:07.200
- NO, I MEAN,
I DON'T CARE.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.567
YOU DO WHAT YOU WANT.

14:18.833 --> 14:21.733
- OKAY, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE START WITH A QUICK WARM-UP?

14:21.733 --> 14:24.167
[music plays]

14:24.167 --> 14:25.967
OKAY, V-STEPS, AND...

14:25.967 --> 14:28.767
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT...

14:34.400 --> 14:36.067
- YOU GONNA DO 40 MINUTES
OF THIS, REALLY?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.100
COME ON.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.500
- RAY, WOULD YOU BE QUIET?

14:38.500 --> 14:40.733
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE?

14:40.733 --> 14:43.767
- I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'D PAY MONEY FOR THIS.

14:43.767 --> 14:45.933
YOU KNOW, WE GOT A FLIGHT
OF STAIRS AT HOME.

14:45.933 --> 14:47.667
- HEY, JUST SHH, SHH!

14:47.667 --> 14:48.700
- AND GRAPEVINE!

14:48.700 --> 14:52.200
HERE WE GO!

14:52.200 --> 14:53.967
- OW!
- SORRY. SORRY.

14:53.967 --> 14:54.967
- YOU FEELIN' IT?

14:54.967 --> 14:56.233
- YEAH!
- YEAH!

14:56.233 --> 14:57.833
- I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
all: YEAH!

14:57.833 --> 15:00.333
- BRING IT ON!

15:00.333 --> 15:01.533
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

15:01.533 --> 15:03.800
- NOTHIN'.
I'M IN THE ZONE.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.667
- HEY! LOOKING GOOD, DEBRA.
LOOKING GOOD!

15:07.667 --> 15:10.467
OKAY, GUYS, KNEE LIFTS,
READY, COUNTDOWN, AND...

15:10.467 --> 15:13.067
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT...

15:16.233 --> 15:18.633
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

15:41.167 --> 15:43.333
AROUND THE WORLD!
HERE WE GO!

15:56.767 --> 15:58.233
[music stops]

16:27.300 --> 16:29.633
- I'LL BE IN THE JUICE BAR.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.500
WELL, I GUESS I'M NOT
AEROBICALLY GIFTED.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.467
- [chuckles]

16:41.467 --> 16:43.233
THAT'S OKAY; A LOT OF PEOPLE
BREAK THE BOOM BOX

16:43.233 --> 16:46.467
ON THEIR FIRST TIME OUT.

16:46.467 --> 16:48.033
- HA.
THAT'S FUNNY.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.033
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX?

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
- WHAT?

16:54.600 --> 16:55.567
- YEAH.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.900
I MEAN,
THE KIDS AREN'T HOME,

16:56.900 --> 16:58.400
AND, UH...

16:58.400 --> 17:00.767
THE HONEYMOON SUITE
IS VACANT.

17:00.767 --> 17:01.767
MMM...

17:01.767 --> 17:03.300
- OHH...HA HA.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.567
NO, NOT RIGHT NOW.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.800
- WHY?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.267
- UM, YOU KNOW,

17:12.267 --> 17:14.433
I'M JUST NOT REALLY
IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.033
- WHY, 'CAUSE YOU MISSED
THE CLASS?

17:17.033 --> 17:18.333
- MISSED THE CLASS?

17:18.333 --> 17:19.967
NO, I'M JUST, YOU KNOW,
NOT IN THE MOOD.

17:19.967 --> 17:22.833
- WHY?

17:22.833 --> 17:24.133
- WHAT ARE YOU, SEVEN?

17:24.133 --> 17:26.367
HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GONNA ASK ME WHY?

17:26.367 --> 17:28.967
- JUST UNTIL
YOU REALLY TELL ME. WHY?

17:28.967 --> 17:31.133
- OKAY, BECAUSE THE KIDS
ARE GONNA BE HOME ANY MINUTE,

17:31.133 --> 17:32.500
I HAVE A SINK
FULL OF DISHES,

17:32.500 --> 17:34.500
AND I JUST--
WHY DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN IT?

17:34.500 --> 17:36.300
I'M JUST NOT IN THE MOOD.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.133
- HOW ABOUT NOW?

17:48.933 --> 17:49.933
YEAH.

17:49.933 --> 17:51.167
- WHAT?

17:51.167 --> 17:53.733
- YEAH. ARE YOU
IN THE MOOD NOW, HUH?

17:53.733 --> 17:56.600
HUH? KICK ONE, TWO,
KICK ONE, TWO.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.067
KICK ONE, TWO.

17:58.067 --> 18:01.233
I'M A MANIAC!
MANIAC!

18:02.500 --> 18:03.833
- AH.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.033
NOW I'M IN THE MOOD.

18:05.033 --> 18:07.167
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

18:07.167 --> 18:08.400
- ALL ABOUT WHAT?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.800
- EVERY TIME
YOU GO TO THE CLASS,

18:09.800 --> 18:11.533
YOU GET ALL TURNED ON
BY HUNKY JOE, RIGHT?

18:11.533 --> 18:13.300
AND THEN...AND THEN
YOU COME HOME TO ME

18:13.300 --> 18:17.233
TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.

18:17.233 --> 18:19.100
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

18:19.100 --> 18:20.300
- LOOKIN' GOOD, DEBRA.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.567
LOOKIN' GOOD!

18:22.567 --> 18:24.133
- SO...

18:24.133 --> 18:25.600
YOU'RE GETTING ALL PARANOID

18:25.600 --> 18:27.500
'CAUSE WE HAD A LITTLE
EXTRA SEX LAST WEEK.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.267
- THREE TIMES.
THREE TIMES, RIGHT?

18:29.267 --> 18:30.700
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

18:30.700 --> 18:32.767
I'M SURPRISED
IT WASN'T ON THE NEWS.

18:34.367 --> 18:39.133
- SO YOU THINK I'M CHEATING
ON YOU WITH YOU?

18:44.300 --> 18:45.933
- PUT IT HOWEVER
YOU WANT, ALL RIGHT?

18:45.933 --> 18:47.200
YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.700
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TIRED.

18:48.700 --> 18:52.500
COULD YOU JUST
CALL YOURSELF AN IDIOT?

18:52.500 --> 18:55.400
- YEAH.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.167
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT,
RIGHT?

18:57.167 --> 18:59.133
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT
IF I DID THAT TO YOU?

18:59.133 --> 19:01.233
- OH, PLEASE!

19:01.233 --> 19:02.467
WHAT ABOUT EVERY YEAR

19:02.467 --> 19:04.333
WHEN THAT STUPID
SWIMSUIT ISSUE ARRIVES?

19:04.333 --> 19:06.300
I KNOW I'M NOT GONNA BE
GETTING MUCH SLEEP THAT NIGHT.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.667
WHY IS THAT, RAY?

19:07.667 --> 19:09.533
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:09.533 --> 19:11.033
DON'T TRY AND MAKE THAT
LIKE THIS.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.400
- WHAT ABOUT
THE NAKED CHANNEL

19:12.400 --> 19:13.667
THAT YOU'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO CHECK

19:13.667 --> 19:17.133
TO SEE IF THEY FORGOT
TO SCRAMBLE IT?

19:17.133 --> 19:18.500
- I'M NOT CHECKING IT.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.600
IT'S ON THE WAY
TO THE TRAVEL CHANNEL.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.033
THAT'S NOT--

19:22.033 --> 19:23.533
- WHO'S THE ONE
IN THE BEDROOM

19:23.533 --> 19:25.733
WITH ALL THE LITTLE
CHARACTER SUGGESTIONS, HUH?

19:25.733 --> 19:29.033
"I'M THE STOCK BOY,
AND YOU CAN'T REACH THE SAUCE."

19:29.033 --> 19:33.400
OR, "OOH, COME TO BED
WITH A LIMP."

19:33.400 --> 19:35.500
- LOOK...THAT ISN'T
THE SAME, ALL RIGHT?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.100
YOU CAN'T COMPARE THAT.
- NO? WHY IS THAT?

19:37.100 --> 19:38.600
- BECAUSE NONE OF THOSE
THINGS ARE REAL, OKAY?

19:38.600 --> 19:40.300
THEY'RE ALL MAKE-BELIEVE!
THEY'RE GAMES!

19:40.300 --> 19:41.900
THIS GUY IS REAL.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.500
HE'S FLESH AND BLOOD
AND SWEAT AND MUSCLES, OKAY?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.767
AND I DON'T LIKE IT!
I DON'T LIKE IT!

19:59.600 --> 20:01.000
- RAY, DID IT EVER
OCCUR TO YOU

20:01.000 --> 20:03.033
THAT TAKING
AEROBICS CLASSES

20:03.033 --> 20:06.300
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF?

20:08.167 --> 20:10.167
YEAH, SO IF I FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF,

20:10.167 --> 20:14.200
I FEEL BETTER ABOUT
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.667
- YEAH, BUT THAT GUY--

20:15.667 --> 20:18.100
- THAT GUY JUST TEACHES CLASS;
THAT'S ALL.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.567
- THAT'S ALL?
- THAT'S IT.

20:22.567 --> 20:25.367
YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN
GOOD-LOOKING MEN BEFORE.

20:27.733 --> 20:29.967
- WHERE?

20:29.967 --> 20:33.233
- ALL YOU EVER DO IS COMPLAIN
ABOUT HOW LITTLE SEX WE HAVE,

20:33.233 --> 20:34.733
AND LAST WEEK,
WE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH,

20:34.733 --> 20:37.433
AND ALL IT DID
WAS MAKE YOU SUSPICIOUS.

20:41.267 --> 20:42.700
- AH, I DON'T KNOW.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.033
I'M AN IDIOT, I GUESS.

20:45.033 --> 20:47.367
- MY IDIOT.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.200
YEAH.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.733
- THERE'S THAT KISS AGAIN.

20:56.733 --> 20:59.200
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

20:59.200 --> 21:00.733
- THE KIDS ARE GONNA BE HOME
IN 15 MINUTES.

21:00.733 --> 21:03.467
- WELL, GOOD, THEN WE'LL
HAVE TIME FOR A NAP TOO.

21:05.167 --> 21:06.600
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE GARBAGE?

21:06.600 --> 21:07.900
- AH, JUST LEAVE IT.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.500
- OH, YOU'RE DIRTY.

21:18.900 --> 21:21.033
- HEY.
- HEY.

21:21.033 --> 21:23.767
YOU HERE AGAIN?
- YEAH.

21:23.767 --> 21:25.133
I JUST--

21:25.133 --> 21:28.633
I WANTED TO BRING HUNKY JOE
A NEW BOOM BOX.

21:28.633 --> 21:29.900
- HE'S NOT TEACHING
CLASS TODAY.

21:29.900 --> 21:30.967
- WHAT?

21:30.967 --> 21:32.600
- HI, EVERYBODY.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.067
all: HEY.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.067
- EVERYBODY READY TO MOVE?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.633
HERE WE GO.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.800
[music starts]

21:44.800 --> 21:47.367
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT...

21:54.333 --> 21:57.300
- YOU KNOW, I'M FEELING BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.
