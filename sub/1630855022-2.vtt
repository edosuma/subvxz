WEBVTT

00:08.550 --> 00:10.761
What do you think about these?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.221
Does he need sunglasses?

00:12.221 --> 00:15.265
Well, he doesn't need anything.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.894
- But he is expecting 40 gifts.
- Oh, man.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.730
You really set a precedent for yourself.

00:21.730 --> 00:24.149
Is he still giving you penguins
for your birthday?

00:24.149 --> 00:25.692
Oh, no, puffins.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.237
- Puffins.
- Yeah, puffins. Yeah.

00:28.237 --> 00:29.947
And if I had a time machine,

00:29.947 --> 00:33.408
where I could go back to the day,
one time 20 years ago,

00:33.408 --> 00:36.537
where I said I thought puffins were cute,
one time.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.330
Yeah, that's what you'd do.

00:38.330 --> 00:42.000
Oh, no, that's all I'd do.
That reminds me.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.002
I need to get puffin crackers.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.214
Oh, yeah. Nice. Yeah, cute.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.925
Okay, so, how many is that?

00:51.009 --> 00:52.719
With what I have at home,
I think we're up to 37.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.972
- Thirty-seven, okay, okay.
- Yeah.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.643
Why don't you give him a bunch
of quarters for the MORPHO machine?

01:01.311 --> 01:03.856
Yeah, Dusty's definitely not a gamer.

01:04.438 --> 01:05.732
It's not a game.

01:06.567 --> 01:09.236
Wait, Cass, have you not tried it yet?

01:09.236 --> 01:12.739
I feel like you always know
about things before me.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.449
Well, what does it do?

01:14.449 --> 01:15.534
I don't know.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.619
I guess it just tells you
your whole reason

01:17.619 --> 01:19.496
for existing on this earth.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.960
I got "Storyteller"
and I swear to God, it felt like--

01:25.669 --> 01:28.005
it felt like someone just reached
into my soul

01:28.005 --> 01:30.716
and articulated my secret dream.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.221
Well, I guess it helps
if you have a secret dream.

01:37.181 --> 01:38.765
You're going. You're going.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.810
- Go do it. Cass, go do-- Scoot.
- No.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.021
Scoot. Just go do it.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.459
- Nat?
- Hey.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.211
Yeah?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.380
Is this a joke?

02:54.258 --> 02:56.176
Is it a joke to you?

02:56.969 --> 02:58.053
So what'd you get?

02:59.471 --> 03:00.764
Just all of this.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.933
Oh, no, no. From the MORPHO?

03:03.517 --> 03:08.564
I've been taking pictures of people
with the best potentials. So...

03:09.314 --> 03:12.860
Well, I don't think
that mine is photo-worthy, so...

03:15.112 --> 03:16.113
Come on.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.740
- Birthday party.
- Okey doke.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.012
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.098
What happened? Where were you?

04:27.059 --> 04:29.061
I did it. I cracked.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.646
- No.
- Yeah.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.398
How did you get in the store?

04:34.066 --> 04:36.652
I woke up Mr. Johnson.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.820
He wasn't that mad, actually.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.617
Okay. What did you get?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.369
I got "Teacher/Whistler."

04:46.370 --> 04:47.704
What's a teacher whistler?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.250
No, a "Teacher/Whistler."

04:51.250 --> 04:55.170
- No, you got a slash?
- I got a slash, yeah. Look at this.

04:55.879 --> 04:56.880
Yeah,

04:56.880 --> 04:59.842
it seems I have two
equally viable life potentials

04:59.842 --> 05:01.844
and I'm currently achieving them both.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.887
- That's amazing.
- Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.601
I mean, I had a very visceral,
negative reaction at first.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.521
- But then I went for a walk...
- Yeah.

05:12.521 --> 05:16.650
...and I thought, you know what,
this is good, actually, the--

05:16.650 --> 05:20.070
It's good because it's--
What's it? Validating.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.905
I just can't believe
you actually tried it.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.323
I know.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.702
- I mean, you were so against it.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.871
I was afraid to tell you that I tried it.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.499
Because you were so-- I mean, you know,
you were taking it, like, so personal.

05:33.417 --> 05:34.501
So you did try it?

05:35.294 --> 05:36.295
Yeah.

05:36.670 --> 05:37.671
I--

05:44.970 --> 05:47.764
"Loyalty." Yes, another accurate card.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.100
- Oh, no.
- You're incredibly loyal.

05:53.604 --> 05:55.147
What the fuck?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.442
What the fuck?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.112
You got fucking "Royalty"?

06:02.654 --> 06:04.406
- Yeah.
- Wow.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.950
- What does that even mean though?
- I don't know.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.494
Are you supposed to marry
some prince or something?

06:10.162 --> 06:11.413
Okay, first of all,

06:11.413 --> 06:14.791
I don't like that you think I had
to marry into royalty.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.420
And secondly,
I'm not even taking it seriously,

06:18.420 --> 06:21.423
because, like,
it probably doesn't mean anything. Like--

06:21.423 --> 06:23.550
- Yeah. No. It's like--
- It can't even be-- You know.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.845
- Like, it doesn't mean anything.
- Except this one is extremely specific.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.015
Yeah, but maybe your card means something,
and my card means nothing.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.099
Right.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.189
So did you use the machine
before or after I asked you

06:37.189 --> 06:38.899
if you had used it and you said no?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.444
I think after.

06:42.444 --> 06:43.946
- You think after?
- Yeah.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.281
Pretty big difference between the two.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.284
Yeah, it was definitely before I knew
you had such an issue with it.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.994
I don't have an issue with it.

06:50.994 --> 06:53.830
I think it's great, fun for the town.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.249
I mean, look at us.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.669
I have two equally viable potentials
that I'm already achieving,

06:58.669 --> 07:01.088
and yours is completely unattainable, so...

07:06.218 --> 07:07.219
Okay.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.889
Thanks, Angelia.

07:53.015 --> 07:54.808
Because I thought you were joking.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.395
A moat poses
too many safety issues, Martha.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.105
I won't approve it.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.442
Drowning, for one.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.320
I'm being ridiculous.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.571
No, I'm busy.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.407
Perhaps you've heard of a little
town-wide function called Deerfest,

08:10.407 --> 08:12.367
which I single-handedly plan.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.703
I'll bring it up at the next town meeting,

08:14.703 --> 08:17.414
but I'm not gonna
make promises I can't keep.

08:18.457 --> 08:19.499
Honestly.

08:20.167 --> 08:23.921
I broke up with Martha 30 years ago,
and she still finds excuses to call me.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.632
Oh, Cass. If those are more mugs--

08:27.257 --> 08:29.927
It's been hard enough moving the rest
of your recent projects,

08:29.927 --> 08:32.179
with your wine glasses
and your tea towels and whatever.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.347
Well, these are T-shirts,

08:34.347 --> 08:36.850
and maybe they would move

08:36.850 --> 08:39.852
if you put my stuff here
with the "Izzy's picks"

08:39.852 --> 08:41.855
- instead of hiding them in the back.
- Don't be insane.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.066
- They'd accuse me of nepotism.
- Mom, it's your store.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.693
It's also my office,
and I am under constant scrutiny.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.404
As mayor, everything I do is political.

08:50.155 --> 08:52.908
Oh, my God.
What does this even mean, Cass?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.952
It doesn't mean anything. It's a joke.

08:54.952 --> 08:57.287
So is this your first act as Queen?

08:57.287 --> 09:00.165
Making meaningless joke T-shirts
for your people?

09:00.707 --> 09:02.501
- How did you--
- Nat told me.

09:02.501 --> 09:04.378
And guess what?

09:04.962 --> 09:07.965
I got "Dancer" from that machine,
something I actually accomplished,

09:07.965 --> 09:10.759
but you don't see me going around
bragging about it to everyone.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.678
I wasn't bragging.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.221
I wasn't. Nat was just there.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.682
And did Nat suggest the lipstick?

09:17.266 --> 09:20.310
Well, maybe she'll write
about it in the <i>Deerfield Digest</i>.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.272
"Woman wears wrong shade
of lipstick for her complexion."

09:23.272 --> 09:24.731
Okay, this has nothing to do with that.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.817
I'm wearing lipstick
because we're hosting dinner tonight.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.069
- You know that.
- And why are you hosting dinner?

09:30.028 --> 09:33.031
- For Dusty's birthday.
- Don't shout at me, Cass.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.784
I cannot be expected
to remember everybody's birthday.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.995
- I'm not a computer.
- But it's not actually his birthday.

09:37.995 --> 09:39.329
His birthday was 11 days ago,

09:39.329 --> 09:41.415
and then we moved the dinner three times
because of you.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.041
Well, if it's in my calendar,
I'll be there.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.294
Now is there anything else or are we good?

09:46.128 --> 09:47.129
We're good.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.639
Empress Matilda's cousin,
this dude Stephen of Blois,

09:57.639 --> 09:59.183
was basically like,

09:59.183 --> 10:02.144
"Yeah, Henry said on his deathbed
that I could be heir."

10:02.144 --> 10:03.979
But everyone knew Matilda deserved it.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.191
Sorry, Lydia.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.236
Your presentation is great and extensive.

10:11.236 --> 10:15.115
It's just-- I can tell everybody's
really distracted, you know?

10:16.158 --> 10:18.368
I get it.
How are we supposed to invest in history

10:18.368 --> 10:21.288
when you've all got so many questions
to be answered

10:21.288 --> 10:23.540
about what's happening right now,
here in this town?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.960
Specifically, where did this friggin'
MORPHO machine come from?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
That's what they're all wondering.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.340
I mean, what does MORPHO even mean?

10:31.340 --> 10:32.591
It's a butterfly.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.010
It's a butterfly, yeah.
No, that I mean, yeah.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.887
I'm also able to look up things
on the Internet.

10:36.887 --> 10:39.598
You had to look it up?
There's a giant butterfly logo on it.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.558
It's also the shape of a butterfly

10:41.558 --> 10:43.810
and makes butterfly wings
when you put your fingerprints on it.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.145
I understand that, Lydia.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.524
It's just, I meant,
maybe MORPHO means something else,

10:48.524 --> 10:50.609
like, maybe it's also the name
of a company?

10:51.193 --> 10:53.320
So, I did a little search--

10:53.320 --> 10:56.281
We all did a search. You get pictures
of the Blue Morpho butterfly,

10:56.281 --> 10:57.866
but there's no company or anything.

10:57.866 --> 11:00.160
You think the company
would use the same name?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.371
They're using our fingerprints
and social security numbers

11:02.371 --> 11:04.915
as some sort of data mining,
bullshit scheme.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.792
Okay, I've never
had my fingerprints taken,

11:06.792 --> 11:08.252
and Johnson's doesn't even have Wi-Fi.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.920
Yeah,
and even if they're scrubbing our data,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.005
I never said anything
about being a meteorologist

11:12.005 --> 11:13.757
or even thought about wanting to be one.

11:13.757 --> 11:14.842
You don't have to.

11:16.385 --> 11:19.471
Who's to say a person
can't change their potential?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.682
You can't. I tried it three times.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.476
- Okay.
- "Morpho" means "shapely one" in Greek,

11:24.476 --> 11:26.937
and the Ancient Greeks thought
the Blue Morpho could bring messages

11:26.937 --> 11:29.815
about your future and grant wishes
and tell you your destiny.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.860
I put that in the group chat.
So don't act like you knew that.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.278
It's not destiny.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.656
Destiny means,

11:38.323 --> 11:40.325
you know, something will happen
no matter what you do.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.536
Potential is when something could happen.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.706
And it's not necessarily a good thing.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.586
Did your card say something bad?

11:53.172 --> 11:55.257
- No, I was just--
- What did you get, Jacob?

11:55.257 --> 11:57.759
- I was just saying that--
- Oh, shit. What'd you get?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.345
I'm gonna go.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.139
- Everything okay?
- Yeah,

12:02.139 --> 12:04.850
you said that I could be excused
from the Henry stuff, so...

12:05.684 --> 12:07.019
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.272
You really upset him there.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.900
Come on. Let's learn from this, all right?

12:12.900 --> 12:15.402
We can't put that much pressure
on Jacob at the moment, guys.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.446
You were the one who asked
if he got something bad.

12:17.446 --> 12:19.364
- No.
- Obviously he got something bad.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.533
Why wouldn't you tell someone
if you got something good?

12:47.184 --> 12:48.227
Help!

12:50.521 --> 12:51.522
Help!

12:53.440 --> 12:55.192
Help! Somebody out there?

13:01.698 --> 13:03.867
Help! Help me!

13:04.493 --> 13:05.494
Hey!

13:06.286 --> 13:08.080
- Who's that?
- Oh, shit.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.248
Jacob!

13:11.208 --> 13:13.585
Hey, how you doing?

13:14.795 --> 13:16.171
Are you okay? I'm good.

13:16.171 --> 13:18.257
I mean, I'm better now that you're here.

13:18.257 --> 13:21.552
I smacked my head real good,
but I should be all right.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.428
I'm trying not to move myself, you know,

13:23.428 --> 13:25.389
because they say you
shouldn't move yourself.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.724
my phone's strapped into my bike.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.102
Okay, don't move.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.937
- Just stay there...
- Okay.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.814
...and I'll call for help. Okay?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.607
- Okay, all right. Yeah.
- Okay?

13:35.607 --> 13:36.942
- Okay.
- All right.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.402
- It's gonna be all right.
- Okay, fuck.

13:38.402 --> 13:41.238
- Take deep breaths.
- I'm good. It's all good.

13:41.238 --> 13:45.075
You got this. You got this, Jacob.
You're my hero!

13:46.827 --> 13:47.911
All right.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.914
- Honestly, I'm worried.
- Why?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.416
Dad was already raging against the machine

13:52.416 --> 13:54.251
since before it told him
he's reached his peak,

13:54.251 --> 13:56.545
and now Mom's the people's princess.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.422
Like, why is no one talking about this?

13:58.422 --> 14:00.215
Everyone is talking about it, actually.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.593
And your mom is very, very proud of it.

14:02.593 --> 14:06.597
I'm not very proud of it.
And do you have to be texting right now?

14:06.597 --> 14:09.558
I'm asking Principal Pat about her
accident, if that's all right with you?

14:10.726 --> 14:13.604
- Principal Pat was in an accident?
- I don't wanna know.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.273
What about you, Tri?
What did your potential say?

14:16.940 --> 14:19.651
- "Potter."
- Potter, cool.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.028
As in, like, Harry Potter?

14:21.028 --> 14:23.614
Yes, Dad. Like Harry Potter.

14:23.614 --> 14:24.865
Like, ceramics.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.658
- Yes, thank you.
- Yeah.

14:26.658 --> 14:31.330
One of my students did it a few times,
and it came out the same every time.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.414
Yeah.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.625
Yeah?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.752
Did that happen to you?
How many times did you do it?

14:36.752 --> 14:38.462
- Just a few times.
- Well, I got "Dancer,"

14:38.462 --> 14:40.088
in case anyone was wondering.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.507
Not that it's a big surprise.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.718
My career in New York was pretty robust.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.430
But then... life happened.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.143
Would anyone like
some Châteauneuf-du-Pape?

14:53.143 --> 14:54.394
Yes, I'll have some.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.397
Would anyone but Trina like
some Châteauneuf-du-Pape?

14:57.397 --> 15:00.275
I won't say no, Cass.
This wine is delicious.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.363
It's a 2011, which was
a particularly good year in the region.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.657
So you will taste hints
of strawberry and leather.

15:06.657 --> 15:08.617
- Wow.
- I think I'll have some also.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.454
We are celebrating after all.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.748
Cary, I thought we'd at least wait
for dessert.

15:14.748 --> 15:15.832
I can't wait.

15:15.832 --> 15:18.460
- You're finally retiring, aren't you?
- We're not retiring.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.796
But we are changing course.

15:20.796 --> 15:23.924
We're actually getting a divorce.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.428
What?

15:29.304 --> 15:31.849
The MORPHO inspired us.
We couldn't be happier.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.560
How--

15:34.560 --> 15:36.311
how did the MORPHO inspire you?

15:36.311 --> 15:39.356
- Okay, well, my card made me realize...
- Yeah.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.608
...that what I really need is
to spend time alone.

15:42.192 --> 15:47.114
So, I'm taking a trip to Europe
for a year as a single woman.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.576
What is happening?

15:51.076 --> 15:52.786
What did your card say?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.371
- "Healer."
- "Healer"?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.539
"Healer."

15:55.539 --> 15:59.543
A sign from the universe
to engage in self-healing.

15:59.543 --> 16:03.172
Or maybe it meant doctor as in
the profession that you do every day.

16:03.172 --> 16:06.008
No. I don't wanna be a doctor anymore.

16:06.008 --> 16:09.052
I'm all doctored out.
I was a doctor in Ireland.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.972
I moved back here
to take over Mom's practice.

16:11.972 --> 16:15.893
Sweetie, I have never taken time
for myself, even when I got sick.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.144
She never has.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.604
This was the reminder I needed.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.981
- That's awesome, Grandma.
- Thank you, baby.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.901
- I got "Male model."
- Make it stop.

16:23.901 --> 16:25.152
So, specifically male?

16:25.152 --> 16:27.738
I've been telling him
for years he has a gorgeous figure.

16:27.738 --> 16:28.822
Yeah, well.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.283
- It's your job to say that.
- Not anymore, apparently.

16:31.283 --> 16:35.579
Cary has already signed with an agency
that specializes in regional commercials.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.581
- What is it? Mall appearances...
- Right.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.499
...and handsome Santas.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.168
- Oh, shit.
- Handsome Santas?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.419
Yes. Who knew? It's a thing.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.296
This is gonna be so good for us.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.007
Eloise and I were joking the other day.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.759
I said, "We should have
gotten divorced years ago."

16:48.759 --> 16:51.136
- That's a good one, Dad.
- No, but we're glad we didn't.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.973
Because we know how upsetting separation
is for sensitive children.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.934
No, I'm pretty upset right now.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.977
Well, please excuse me.

16:58.977 --> 17:02.564
Oh, Izzy! I hope you're not--
I was not referring to you and Martha.

17:02.564 --> 17:05.651
Obviously,
not every separation is damaging.

17:05.651 --> 17:07.903
Cass turned out delightfully unscathed.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.570
Eloise, not to worry.

17:09.570 --> 17:11.740
Takes way more than that to offend me.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.368
And nobody has to tell me
how wonderful my daughter is.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.204
Thank you all for dinner.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.208
And happy birthday, Dusty.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.710
That's right, it's my birthday party.

17:24.795 --> 17:25.753
Bye, Grandma.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.758
Wow. I'm sorry.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.885
I didn't mean to upset your mother.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.554
It wasn't about her.

17:33.554 --> 17:35.305
Somehow it always is. So...

17:35.305 --> 17:37.057
So do you still love each other?

17:37.057 --> 17:38.600
Oh, God, yes.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.645
Son, trust me, more than ever.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.315
That's why we're setting each other free.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.990
I know it's a lot to deal with, Son.

17:52.990 --> 17:55.075
You know. But you just gotta trust us.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.828
We're doing the right thing for ourselves
and for our relationship.

17:57.828 --> 17:59.997
- Are you flexing?
- No.

17:59.997 --> 18:01.623
These are my relaxed arms.

18:01.623 --> 18:03.500
When did you get so jacked, Dad?

18:04.376 --> 18:05.460
I'm not jacked.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.964
I'm quietly jacked at best.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.883
"Low-key jacked," you'd probably say.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.634
I would never say that.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.304
I just wish you could see
the upside of this, Son.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.683
I mean, this machine, it's helping us to--

18:19.683 --> 18:24.146
to embrace new sides of ourselves
and to learn new things about each other.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.272
Like you.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.692
You never knew
that I was quietly jacked, right?

18:29.318 --> 18:32.196
- And I never knew you could whistle.
- What are you doing right now, though?

18:32.196 --> 18:34.323
I'm baring myself, Son.

18:35.991 --> 18:37.492
And I want you to bare yourself too.

18:37.492 --> 18:39.077
I don't want to take my shirt off.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.831
I want you to whistle for me, Son.

18:42.831 --> 18:43.916
Right now.

18:43.916 --> 18:46.793
How do you get your chest
to be like in two separate parts?

18:46.793 --> 18:50.923
I do a superset with an incline press
and incline dumbbell fly.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.300
And I put a bit of sunscreen
in between my pecs.

18:53.884 --> 18:55.302
I don't like looking at it.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.428
Well...

18:59.431 --> 19:03.352
I'm not putting my shirt back
on until you whistle.

19:06.897 --> 19:10.192
In all those years I lived in Ireland,

19:10.192 --> 19:14.571
when I could just jump
on a flight to Spain for 50 bucks.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.407
I mean, I didn't realize
how much I would miss that.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.117
Yeah.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.912
So you'll have to give me
all your Europe recommendations.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.288
Oh, yeah.

19:23.288 --> 19:26.124
Because I'm definitely the person to ask.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.837
No, wait. Didn't you spend
a semester abroad in college?

19:30.379 --> 19:31.463
Just in Italy.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.716
Just in Italy. Okay.

19:34.716 --> 19:37.094
I lived in Montepulciano, Tuscany.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.137
Monteputia-- Say that again.

19:39.137 --> 19:41.014
Montepulciano.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.808
Oh, my God. That's so beautiful.

19:42.808 --> 19:48.647
There was this little café
where I could read and drink wine and...

19:50.399 --> 19:52.192
- Whatever.
- What were you gonna say?

19:54.152 --> 19:57.698
I don't know, it's like every time
I have a glass of Montepulciano,

19:57.698 --> 19:59.908
I can literally smell the linseed oil

19:59.908 --> 20:02.703
that they would clean the bar
of the café with.

20:03.996 --> 20:05.747
You should go back.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.041
Oh, yeah.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.210
How big is your suitcase? Can I fit?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.546
I mean, I can contort my body.
I'm so little.

20:12.546 --> 20:16.425
Oh, no. You know I would in a heartbeat.
Pop Trina in a carry-on.

20:16.425 --> 20:19.219
Excuse me. I can fit in a carry-on.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.724
But I also kind of like the idea
of doing this on my own.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.769
Wait. Why are we doing the dishes?

20:27.769 --> 20:29.688
Let's see what those boys are up to.
Come on.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.079
Uh-oh.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.665
Oh, my.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.958
Work it, babe.

20:49.958 --> 20:52.252
Yeah, we were just having a bit
of guy time down here.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.837
It's more of a father-son thing.

20:53.837 --> 20:57.633
Oh, yes.
This is very classic father-son behavior.

20:57.633 --> 20:59.092
So I'm gonna just--

20:59.092 --> 21:01.386
I'm gonna get out of the way.

21:02.554 --> 21:04.515
What's going on with this shirt?

21:04.515 --> 21:06.433
Why didn't you? Why did you--

21:06.433 --> 21:08.644
Babe,
why are you holding the shirt like that?

21:25.327 --> 21:26.620
Daddy.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.829
Don't call him "Daddy."

21:27.829 --> 21:31.083
Oh, my God. You-- Stop. It's too sexy.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.293
You're just saying that
because you're my ex-wife.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.547
Okay, Eloise.
So, I just wanted to give you this.

21:36.547 --> 21:39.007
- Now, it's about wine...
- Yes.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.343
...but it gets deep
into the geography as well, so...

21:41.343 --> 21:42.928
I thought you'd only been to Italy.

21:42.928 --> 21:44.012
- This is--
- Oh, yeah.

21:44.012 --> 21:46.682
Well, at one point I thought
I might go to France, but...

21:47.266 --> 21:49.226
- I feel bad taking this.
- Oh, no, don't.

21:49.226 --> 21:51.270
And I never look at it.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.731
Well, thank you.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.234
And I hope you know we love you both.

21:57.234 --> 22:00.112
- Love you too, Mom.
- Love you too.

22:00.112 --> 22:02.865
- Yes. We love you both. Both of you.
- Yes. She just said it, Dad.

22:02.865 --> 22:05.284
She just said it.
You're so sweaty now. Look at that.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.452
That's okay. He still smells amazing.

22:08.620 --> 22:12.291
All right. We can all smell my father
later on. Let's get you guys home.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.001
Okay. You got everything, baby.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.253
- Love you.
- Take care.

22:16.753 --> 22:17.754
Be good.

22:21.133 --> 22:22.467
I'm sorry, what?

22:25.262 --> 22:28.265
Hey. I know that was a shock for you.

22:28.265 --> 22:31.894
- Yeah.
- But they seem really happy.

22:31.894 --> 22:34.229
So, that's gotta be good, right?

22:36.273 --> 22:37.441
I mean, you know,

22:37.441 --> 22:41.445
I'd like it to be recognized
that it's extremely rash

22:42.779 --> 22:43.906
and destabilizing.

22:43.906 --> 22:46.491
You know, now that the catwalk
and whistling have concluded.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.620
We don't need to encourage people
to have a divorce.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.164
You think the world
needs more divorced models?

22:52.164 --> 22:54.791
- I was--
- This is madness! No?

22:55.334 --> 22:56.668
What is going on with everybody?

22:56.668 --> 22:58.921
Why is everybody so desperate
to change their lives overnight?

22:58.921 --> 23:01.715
And why did you get me a theremin?
Let's talk about that.

23:02.424 --> 23:03.842
About what? The theremin?

23:03.842 --> 23:06.220
The theremin, yes. Yes, the theremin.

23:06.220 --> 23:08.680
I didn't ask for this.
It wasn't on my list.

23:08.680 --> 23:09.932
What are you--

23:10.682 --> 23:13.602
What are you trying to say to me
when you get me something like that?

23:13.602 --> 23:17.397
I just thought I'd give you something
to try that's different and unique.

23:18.023 --> 23:19.399
Because I'm not unique.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.611
Oh, my God, Dusty. No. Oh, my gosh.

23:22.611 --> 23:25.739
You are special. You are amazing.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.951
But, sweetie,
your dad is pursuing a new career,

23:28.951 --> 23:30.369
your mom is traveling the world,

23:30.369 --> 23:33.330
and you can't even try
a little musical instrument?

23:33.330 --> 23:35.415
- She said Europe.
- What?

23:35.415 --> 23:37.709
No, it was just, like, you said,
"Oh, she's traveling the world."

23:37.709 --> 23:38.877
She said Europe.

23:38.877 --> 23:41.922
Okay, well, that's one more continent
than you're willing to try, so...

23:41.922 --> 23:44.842
I have been to Europe, Cass.
Where do you think Ireland is?

23:44.842 --> 23:48.136
You haven't actually been
to Europe, Dusty.

23:48.136 --> 23:51.014
You came from Europe.
You actually haven't been anywhere.

23:51.014 --> 23:52.850
I'm sorry, Amelia Earhart.

23:52.850 --> 23:56.979
I forgot about your little voyage
through the vineyards two decades ago.

23:59.231 --> 24:00.357
Well, I'm sorry too.

24:00.858 --> 24:06.071
I am sorry that you have no interest
in broadening your horizons.

24:07.155 --> 24:09.575
And I'm sorry that I bought you something
that you didn't ask for.

24:10.242 --> 24:11.952
- Apology accepted.
- No!

24:12.786 --> 24:14.413
You don't get to accept
my fake apology, so...

24:14.413 --> 24:15.998
I accept it wholeheartedly.

24:18.166 --> 24:20.252
You asked if I was happy.

24:22.421 --> 24:23.714
Are you happy?

24:24.506 --> 24:25.674
Is this happy--

24:25.674 --> 24:30.345
I don't know if this is happy, Cass.

24:30.345 --> 24:33.599
I've never really had to think about it,
and that was just fine.

24:34.183 --> 24:36.101
But now because
of some stupid fucking machine,

24:36.101 --> 24:37.519
I have to think about it all the time.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.730
Well, I have to think
about it all the time too.

24:39.730 --> 24:43.525
And what I think, is
if and how I can be happier.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.738
Maybe you should try that too.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.376
So, that's new.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.461
What is?

25:02.461 --> 25:04.463
You and Dad fighting.

25:05.839 --> 25:08.050
Well. It's nothing to worry about.

25:08.550 --> 25:10.511
- We're okay.
- I'm not worried.

25:10.511 --> 25:14.223
Apparently,
only really happy people get divorced.

25:14.223 --> 25:18.018
Did you know that tasting wine
is a five-step process?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.939
That's not what wi-- Wow.

25:21.939 --> 25:23.690
Where are the five steps exactly?

25:24.149 --> 25:26.944
Okay. All right, that was a freebie.

25:27.694 --> 25:31.740
The first step, you want
to look at the color.

25:33.951 --> 25:34.952
Wow.

25:35.285 --> 25:39.456
Okay, so, take this glass and hold it up.
Tilt it towards the light.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.792
It's red.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.212
So next, you wanna swirl. Okay.

25:45.212 --> 25:46.922
So very gentle with your wrist.

25:47.714 --> 25:50.676
Okay, now that opens the wine up.

25:50.676 --> 25:53.470
Now, do you see those little streaks
on the side of the glass?

25:54.179 --> 25:55.931
- Yeah.
- Those are called legs.

25:55.931 --> 26:00.018
Question. Do we ever actually
get to drink the wine, or is it just...

26:00.018 --> 26:02.062
Will you tell me what you smell?

26:04.273 --> 26:05.399
Like, cherry?

26:05.399 --> 26:07.609
- Yes. Okay. So, now sip.
- Okay.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.949
Sip. Yep. That's good.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.661
And now you savor.

26:25.586 --> 26:29.006
This MORPHO thing's really
throwing you for a loop, isn't it?

26:31.133 --> 26:32.551
It really is.

26:33.719 --> 26:35.345
I think what I'm realizing

26:35.345 --> 26:40.017
is that I wanna be the kind
of mom that you admire.

26:40.934 --> 26:41.977
You are.

26:42.769 --> 26:47.357
No, but, like... to be that, I can't--

26:47.357 --> 26:49.443
I can't have my own frustrations,
you know?

26:49.443 --> 26:53.488
Like, I can't be the type of person
who is so bitter about her failed dreams

26:53.488 --> 26:56.783
that she just has to make you feel small
at every opportunity.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.329
Well, I don't know
who you could possibly be talking about.

27:00.329 --> 27:02.331
It's purely hypothetical.

27:02.331 --> 27:04.041
Of course.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.211
I just don't wanna fuck you up.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.048
Well, I am pretty fucked up already.

27:11.048 --> 27:13.634
So you may have just missed the boat.

27:26.355 --> 27:29.274
If this is about the whole machine thing,

27:29.274 --> 27:32.069
I think you need to let yourself
off the hook a bit.

27:32.069 --> 27:34.613
It's only important
if you want it to be important.

27:40.452 --> 27:43.163
I think I want it to be important, Trina.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.998
And if that's--

27:46.124 --> 27:48.126
I know you're laughing at me, but...

27:48.126 --> 27:49.837
I'm not laughing at you.

27:51.547 --> 27:53.465
I just need it to mean something.

27:54.675 --> 27:55.759
Well...

27:57.803 --> 27:59.221
Make it mean something.

29:12.419 --> 29:15.631
I'm pulling my products.
You can't sell them anymore.

29:15.631 --> 29:17.257
I'll call you back.

29:19.510 --> 29:21.595
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

29:22.429 --> 29:26.308
You don't get to decide
what other people should want.

29:26.308 --> 29:27.559
Okay?

29:27.559 --> 29:31.355
Do you think that the people
of Deerfield want cheap deer shit?

29:31.355 --> 29:36.193
When was the last time anybody
even saw a fucking deer in this town?

29:36.193 --> 29:39.488
It shouldn't even be called Deerfield.
It should be called Field.

29:39.488 --> 29:44.743
Well, the deer statues are top sellers.
Unlike anything you've made.

29:44.743 --> 29:46.662
Yeah? Yeah?

29:46.662 --> 29:50.123
Okay, well let's take a look
at your other top sellers, shall we?

29:50.624 --> 29:51.917
Like this here.

29:53.460 --> 29:57.965
"Home is for family."
Really? Is that what home is for?

29:57.965 --> 30:01.134
Well, then please,
I mean, let me purchase all of these.

30:01.134 --> 30:04.388
As well as a rock, because as we all know,

30:04.388 --> 30:06.557
"Deerfield rocks."

30:06.557 --> 30:08.892
I mean, you know what doesn't rock?

30:09.685 --> 30:12.104
Painted rocks. Painted rocks do not rock.

30:12.688 --> 30:14.898
Painted rocks fucking suck!

30:14.898 --> 30:16.608
You don't like my rocks?

30:18.402 --> 30:20.237
Sheila. I love your rocks, they're great.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.239
I was just kinda making an overall point.

30:22.239 --> 30:26.285
So, I would actually love
to purchase one of your rocks.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.162
Fifty dollars? For the small one?

30:29.162 --> 30:32.249
They're expensive
because of the fine detail.

30:32.749 --> 30:33.750
Okay.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.961
You know what?
I will be back to purchase a rock.

30:35.961 --> 30:40.591
Right now, my hands are full,
because I am taking these pillows.

30:40.591 --> 30:42.176
Call the mayor.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.063
Okay. I know you didn't wanna do this.

30:55.063 --> 30:59.151
But I really think it's going
to inspire people.

31:00.694 --> 31:02.738
I find it really embarrassing.

31:02.738 --> 31:07.034
I know, but, it's good for the store.

31:09.536 --> 31:12.956
Now please hold it up high for me.
