WEBVTT

00:10.110 --> 00:12.328
All right, one more shot.
Here's to New York.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.231
The only place
tha_t could _turn a natural
disaster Into a party.

00:15.310 --> 00:18.006
Here's to the hurricane
blowmg offshore

00:18.080 --> 00:20.878
and leaving us
the hell alone.

00:20.950 --> 00:22.349
Drink, drink!

00:22.420 --> 00:25.548
EMCEE: All right,
everybody, final question.

00:25.620 --> 00:28.589
Superman's father's name.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.787
Trick question.
Krypton dad or real dad?

00:30.860 --> 00:33.499
Krypton!
Oh! Whoa.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.323
Perfect memory girl,

00:35.400 --> 00:36.958
you have an unfair advantage.
Not supposed to play,
remember?

00:37.030 --> 00:38.258
EMCEE: Pencils down,
pencils down.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.059
I'm not playing,
I'm simply offering

00:40.140 --> 00:43.837
emotional support to my team.
I'm like a cheerleader.

00:43.910 --> 00:45.639
I'm gonna keep
my eye on you, then.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.632
Well, why should
that change? You've been
doing it all night.

00:49.180 --> 00:52.616
All right, the correct
answer is Jor-El.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.945
Ladder Company 70
nailed it!

00:58.050 --> 00:59.551
All right!

01:01.260 --> 01:03.353
All right, that means
we got a tie

01:03.430 --> 01:06.126
between Major Crimes
and Ladder Company 70.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.794
That means a bonus
question will determine
tonight's champion.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.521
Buy me a victory
drink after?

01:10.600 --> 01:12.329
Hey, why don't you
back up, beefcake?

01:12.400 --> 01:13.537
Oh ho ho!

01:13.600 --> 01:14.692
I know Kung furate,
why don't you get back

01:14.770 --> 01:16.135
on your side, man.
Cops over here,

01:16.210 --> 01:17.734
chutes and ladders
over there, pal!

01:17.810 --> 01:19.801
All right, all right.
Listen, we played a song

01:19.880 --> 01:21.677
before all 30 questions
tonight. Okay.

01:21.740 --> 01:24.903
Give us the song titles
of the third, ninth,

01:24.980 --> 01:26.743
and 17th songs we played.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.118
Hey, can I get
your number?
Yes, you may.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.543
Thank you.

01:30.620 --> 01:31.814
6-4-6...
Uh-huh.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.209
...5-5-5...
Uh-huh.

01:33.290 --> 01:36.259
...0-1-7-1.
0-1-7-1.

01:36.330 --> 01:37.581
Mmm-hmm.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.027
It shouldn't take that long
to type my number down.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.625
I'm sending
a message.
Oh.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.258
Will I like it?

01:47.340 --> 01:48.762
It's a winner.

01:48.840 --> 01:49.966
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.134
Oh.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.572
I got it.
We got it!

01:58.650 --> 01:59.639
We got it!
Got it!

01:59.720 --> 02:00.709
Got it!
I got it!

02:00.780 --> 02:02.179
Whoo!

02:15.660 --> 02:16.968
I don't see what
the big deal is.

02:17.030 --> 02:18.395
Looks fine out there.

02:18.470 --> 02:19.892
Give it a few hours.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.764
I just heard on the radio,
could be worse than Sandy.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.398
Category four maybe.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.777
All right, well,
we gotta stack these bags
around these pylons

02:27.840 --> 02:29.239
storm's coming up
from the South.

02:29.310 --> 02:30.777
Damn it!

02:35.880 --> 02:37.108
Oh!

02:41.860 --> 02:43.748
I'm not gonna lie,
I got a "Hunker down
for the hurricane"

02:43.830 --> 02:45.183
happy hour hangover.

02:45.260 --> 02:46.522
Come by my lab.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.794
I'll hook you up
with a hangover cure

02:47.860 --> 02:49.259
I picked up
in Med school.
Oh, thank you.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.467
What do we got?

02:50.530 --> 02:52.896
Body of a young girl.
Right over here.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.473
Girl's name is
Sadie Kopinski.

02:59.540 --> 03:02.077
19-year-old
from Yonkers.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.142
Some kind of ligature
was used to strangle her.

03:04.210 --> 03:06.269
Still haven't
determined the source.

03:06.350 --> 03:07.669
Unis are canvassing
the beach for something

03:07.750 --> 03:09.388
that would've left
a pattern like that.

03:09.450 --> 03:12.248
And she has a contusion
on her left parietal bone.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.414
Lack of defensive wounds
suggests she was knocked out
before she was strangled.

03:15.490 --> 03:18.755
CSUs are trying
to get what they can
before the wind picks up.

03:18.830 --> 03:20.650
Scene's a mess.
I doubt they'll find much.

03:21.530 --> 03:23.066
She's just a baby.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.818
Hurricane Guin continues
to pound Its way

03:40.880 --> 03:43.678
toward the tri-stat_e area
With no sngn of letting up.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.583
Boasting sustained winds
over 90 miles per hour,

03:46.660 --> 03:49.083
Guin promises to be
the most powerful storm

03:49.160 --> 03:51.355
to hit the city
since Hurricane Sandy...

03:51.430 --> 03:52.692
Hey, what are
we looking at?

03:52.760 --> 03:53.954
Oh, at my apartment.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.850
Actually, uh,
from the camera
inside the ATM

03:55.930 --> 03:56.999
across from my apartment.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.469
What are you,
spying on yourself?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.395
No, I just, uh, didn't know
if I closed my windows,

04:00.470 --> 04:02.563
and with the storm coming,
I ain't taking any chances.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.868
That your neighbor?
Yup.

04:03.940 --> 04:05.828
She's smokin'.
Yep.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.434
No, no, no, wait.
Go back.

04:07.510 --> 04:09.501
No, that's
not happening.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.413
_ Looks like
my wmdows are closed,
so crisis averted.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.970
Spying on your neighbor
again there, Jay?

04:14.050 --> 04:15.449
What?
No!

04:15.520 --> 04:17.044
Ah.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.189
What do we have
on our Vic?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.418
Sadie Kopinski,
former student

04:21.490 --> 04:23.048
at the Big Apple
School of Beauty.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.279
Dropped out earlier this year

04:24.360 --> 04:25.987
after her second arrest
for drug possessnon.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.857
She lived with her parents,
Ray and Fiona Kopinski

04:27.930 --> 04:29.420
out in Yonkers,
both of which

04:29.500 --> 04:31.388
were on the graveyard shift
at the time of Sadie's death.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.335
No sign of forced entry
or struggle at the home.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.038
So my guess is,
she wasn't killed there.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.829
You got a timeline for her
the night she was killed?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.832
Street cam outside
her parents' place

04:38.910 --> 04:41.674
caught her leaving
Sunday night at 6:30 PM.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.002
Where'd she go next?

04:43.080 --> 04:44.945
According to her
cell phone GPS,
she was home all night.

04:45.010 --> 04:46.568
Which we know isn't true.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.470
Sadie left her cell phone
at home before heading out.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.984
What kind of 19-year-old
leaves her cell phone at home?

04:51.050 --> 04:53.553
Sadie's cell had one of those
"Find My Phone" apps

04:53.620 --> 04:55.918
installed by her parents,
which they access regularly.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.184
She probably leaves
her phone at home

04:57.260 --> 04:58.727
in case her parents try
to check up on her.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.655
Maybe she's up to old habits?

05:00.730 --> 05:03.426
Not necessarily.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.058
Just got Delina's
autopsy report,

05:05.130 --> 05:07.234
and it looks like
her tox screen
came back clean.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.291
So Sadie wa_sn't
currently usmg.

05:09.370 --> 05:10.701
Anything else?

05:10.770 --> 05:13.375
Delina did find traces
of polyethylene resin

05:13.440 --> 05:14.668
throughout her
thoracic region.

05:14.740 --> 05:16.276
It's a chemical compound

05:16.350 --> 05:19.171
found in plastic bags, tubing,
adhesive tape, and bottles.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.343
Any of those things
could've made contact
with her body

05:21.420 --> 05:23.741
after it was dumped
at the beach.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.845
See if you can run down
any of Sadie's friends.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.581
Carrie and I'll
talk to her parents.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.116
We're on it, boss.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.028
Sadie had her
problems, but...

05:36.100 --> 05:38.125
Who would want
to hurt my little girl?

05:44.840 --> 05:46.262
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.399
We're gonna
do our best

05:48.480 --> 05:50.038
to find whoever
did this, okay?

05:53.150 --> 05:56.142
FIONA: Ever since
she was little,
she loved makeup.

05:56.220 --> 05:58.188
I'd let her do mine.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.980
We'd sit around
for hours.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.187
She wanted to do makeup
for Broadway shows,

06:03.260 --> 06:07.458
but she was never
able to stay sober
long enough to.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.798
I'm sorry.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.467
You sure I can't
get you anything?

06:15.540 --> 06:16.859
Nah, I'm good.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.228
Any idea where
Sadie went last night?

06:20.310 --> 06:22.778
No, we didn't even know
that she'd left the house

06:22.850 --> 06:24.670
till after we came home
from work this morning.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.001
Can you think of anyone
who would want

06:26.080 --> 06:28.219
to hurt your daughter?

06:28.280 --> 06:29.679
She was turning
her life around,

06:29.750 --> 06:31.843
going to NA meetings.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.478
Anything out
of the ordinary?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.686
I mean,
coming out of rehab

06:34.760 --> 06:36.113
must have been
a tough adjustment.

06:38.660 --> 06:41.493
Actually,
there was a setback
a few weeks ago.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.720
What happened?

06:42.800 --> 06:44.222
Sadie was arrested
for petty theft,

06:44.300 --> 06:46.188
but the charges
were dropped.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.295
Never went on her record.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.201
Why were the charges dropped?

06:50.270 --> 06:52.067
I don't know.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.438
Sadie didn't want
to talk about it.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.876
We were just relieved.

07:00.020 --> 07:03.114
She had had so many
tough breaks.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.211
We didn't want to look
a gift horse in the mouth.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.520
There it is, no wonder why
it didn't show up at first.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.862
Sadie's latest
brush with the law

07:18.930 --> 07:20.591
was erased from
the OM. database.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.194
But you found it, Detective.

07:22.270 --> 07:25.967
Sadie was arrested
for stealing the purse
of a Betty Wiggins,

07:26.040 --> 07:27.507
but then the charges
were withdrawn

07:27.580 --> 07:30.845
by Betty's grandson,
Robert.

07:30.910 --> 07:32.377
Robert Wiggins.

07:32.450 --> 07:34.816
As in Robert Wiggins?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.780
Oh, my God.
One and the same.

07:36.850 --> 07:38.078
Who the hell
are you talking about?

07:38.150 --> 07:39.139
Robert Wiggins?
Yeah.

07:39.220 --> 07:40.778
Better known as R-Dubbs.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.487
What is it

07:42.560 --> 07:44.653
Drug dealer turned
heavy-hitting music producer.
RDub.

07:44.730 --> 07:48.120
Multiple arrests
for aggravated assault,
drugs, firearm possession.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.929
He even did a stretch
up at Riker's.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.390
So what do we think,
that he got his grandmother
to refuse to prosecute

07:53.470 --> 07:55.062
so he could take care
of it on his own?

07:55.140 --> 07:56.539
That makes sense.

07:56.610 --> 07:59.602
I mean, lyrically, RDub's
all about street justice.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.814
You think I'd kill a girl
for robbing my grandma?

08:06.880 --> 08:09.348
You've assaulted people
over a hell of a lot less.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.638
I would kill someone
for robbing my grandmother,

08:11.720 --> 08:13.654
so I ain't insulted
by the inquiry.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.483
What about a girl?
Would you kill her?

08:15.560 --> 08:17.118
I don't hit girls.

08:17.190 --> 08:19.727
I got a business to run,
which is what I was doing

08:19.800 --> 08:21.290
night before last.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.021
I was at a show in Philly.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.159
Someplace called
Low End Theory.

08:25.230 --> 08:26.993
_Someone there
Will remember me.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.765
You better
hope they do.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.831
And don't even think
about leaving town.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.777
Look.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.001
I wanted to press charges,
but the detective on the case

08:35.080 --> 08:37.048
convinced me it'd be
a waste of my time.

08:37.110 --> 08:39.305
He said there wasn't enough
evidence against her.

08:39.380 --> 08:41.109
Remember the name
of this detective?

08:41.180 --> 08:43.887
Uh...
Frank something.

08:43.950 --> 08:45.417
Frank Fleming.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.258
She wanted to do makeup
for Broadway shows...

08:53.930 --> 08:55.488
He's not our killer.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.893
He's not our killer.
He's not?

08:59.970 --> 09:02.336
I saw the initials "FF"
on a ticket envelope

09:02.400 --> 09:04.937
in Sadie's room.
Frank Fleming.

09:05.010 --> 09:06.807
You think he bought
her the tickets?

09:06.880 --> 09:09.132
I don't know, but he buried
the case for some reason.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.349
Listen, Delina's report
said that Sadie

09:11.410 --> 09:14.948
had a resin on her chest
consistent with adhesive tape.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.341
What if Sadie_
was wearing a Wire?

09:17.420 --> 09:19.547
You think Fleming
tossed Sadie's case

09:19.620 --> 09:22.748
in exchange for her
working as a confidential
informant?

09:22.830 --> 09:24.127
That's kind of a leap.

09:24.190 --> 09:26.852
I'm the queen of leaping
to conclusions, you know that.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.592
You're the queen
of a few other things
I can think of too.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.069
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

09:31.130 --> 09:32.631
Let's bring Fleming in.

09:32.700 --> 09:35.066
If he leveraged Sadie
into doing his dirty work,

09:35.140 --> 09:37.108
that could be
how she got killed.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.678
Lieutenant Al Burns.
Frank Fleming.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.342
Thanks for
coming in, Frank.

09:51.950 --> 09:54.783
Major Crimes.
I musta hit the big time.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.124
Yeah.
Something like that.

09:57.190 --> 09:58.987
If you're looking for me
to consult on the case,

09:59.060 --> 10:01.153
when it comes
to narcotics, I'm the guy.

10:01.230 --> 10:02.788
Actually,
there is a case.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.269
Sadie Kopinski.

10:04.330 --> 10:06.639
What about her?

10:06.700 --> 10:08.065
That's what
I want to know.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.058
Tweaked-out C.I.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.209
You pick her up?

10:12.270 --> 10:14.329
Because she is into me
for 10 grand

10:14.410 --> 10:15.900
of buy money
that I fronted her.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.845
That's the least
of your troubles, Detective.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.279
Sadie's dead.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.113
What?

10:22.180 --> 10:24.512
And you got a lot
of explainin' to do, Frank.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.149
I didn't know
she was dead.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.391
What'd you think happened
when you lost track of her?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.134
I figured
she ditched the wire

10:41.200 --> 10:43.464
and bolted with the money
I gave her for the buy.

10:43.540 --> 10:45.599
It wouldn't be
the first time a CI. took off

10:45.670 --> 10:46.876
with a bag full of cash.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.805
Did you even
look for her?

10:48.880 --> 10:51.974
I scoured the park
where she was set
to meet the dealer.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.575
There was
no sign of her,
so I left.

10:54.650 --> 10:55.912
And you got
Sadie killed.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.413
Back off, Lieutenant.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.817
You have no idea
how much...

11:03.530 --> 11:04.554
What?

11:06.390 --> 11:07.391
Forget it.

11:09.530 --> 11:10.667
Oh.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.289
It's okay, Frank.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.568
What's okay?

11:20.540 --> 11:22.405
We figured out

11:22.480 --> 11:24.846
who gave these
Broadway tickets to Sadie.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.646
I thought maybe
it was payment,

11:28.720 --> 11:29.789
or you were bangin' her.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.587
It wasn't like that.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.810
No, it wasn't.

11:35.460 --> 11:36.722
She mattered to you.

11:38.390 --> 11:42.429
You two...
Was it serious?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.321
You wouldn't
be the first good cop
to fall for a troubled...

11:45.400 --> 11:47.334
No, it wasn't
anything like that.

11:50.370 --> 11:53.498
She... She was
a good kid.

11:56.580 --> 11:58.400
When I wired her up,

11:58.480 --> 12:03.213
I just thought we'd be getting
another scumbag drug dealer
off the streets.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.315
I never thought it would
end up like this.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.355
Then you gotta help us
nail her killer.

12:10.590 --> 12:12.353
Who was the dealer
she met up with?

12:14.360 --> 12:16.294
All right, so,
meet our prime suspect,

12:16.360 --> 12:18.328
at least according
to Frank Fleming, anyways,

12:18.400 --> 12:19.936
a dealer named
Bobby Ewers.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.059
Now, Fleming sent over
Sadie's C.I. file,

12:22.140 --> 12:25.462
so it does look like
she met up with Ewers
a few days ago.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.337
There's something
you should know
about Ewers, Carrie.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.777
This guys works
for one of the East Coast's
nastiest crime syndicates.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.774
It's run by Lorenzo Abrelli,
aka The Shadow.

12:33.850 --> 12:36.614
The Shadow?
Mmm-hmm.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.513
Now, we've got next to nothing
on this guy on the database.

12:39.590 --> 12:42.889
He's never been arrested.
People haven't even
seen him in years.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.882
This guy is literally
a ghost.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.099
I mean, all I could
find on him?

12:47.960 --> 12:50.326
These low-res photos.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.924
I know about
this guy, Lorenzo.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.639
He grew up in the Jersey
foster-ca re system,

12:54.700 --> 12:55.997
bounced from
family to family,

12:56.070 --> 12:58.004
probably because
of his volatile temper.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.777
When he was 12 years old,
system lost track of him.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.502
How'd that happen?
A fi re destroyed
the foster home he was in,

13:03.580 --> 13:05.548
left him with a nasty
scar on his arm.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.669
This boy walked
out of the hospital.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.513
Nobody's seen him since.

13:09.580 --> 13:12.117
But now, he's got
a wall of people
surrounding him,

13:12.190 --> 13:15.409
protecting him. All of them
capable of murdering a CI.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.620
Whoa, hold on.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.624
There's some activity
on Sadie's credit card.

13:19.690 --> 13:21.954
Looks like Ewers bought
a train ticket to Toronto.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.123
Leav_es Penn Station
in an hour.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.760
And he's running up a tab
at a bar across the street
from the station.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.535
Jeez, looks like
he's buying a drink

13:28.600 --> 13:29.635
for everybody in the house.

13:29.700 --> 13:31.008
Generous guy.

13:31.070 --> 13:33.106
Hey boss, we got
a patrol car down
the block from the bar.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.102
All right, let's pick him up.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.636
We're bringing the party
here, boys.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.177
Yep.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.588
We found
your ditched car.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.914
And guess what?
There's blood
in the trunk.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.552
I'm betting
once they run it,

13:50.630 --> 13:52.279
they'll find out
it belongs to Sadie.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.759
I didn't kill her.

13:53.830 --> 13:56.822
Oh, we are way
past that, Bobby.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.460
We have all the evidence
we need to conVIct you.

14:03.770 --> 14:05.658
Okay, maybe I freaked out

14:05.740 --> 14:07.276
when I realized _
she was wearing a Wire,

14:08.110 --> 14:09.270
and I hit her,

14:09.340 --> 14:11.103
but she was
definitely alive.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.614
I didn't know
what to do, so I took her
to the people I work for.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.148
You brought
an unconscious C.I.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.848
to the headquarters
of a major drug operation?

14:18.920 --> 14:20.615
Yeah.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.214
That's what
my bosses said, too.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.155
You mean Lorenzo's people.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.822
I don't know who it was.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.519
I work with a guy, Diego.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.160
He told me to get lost
for an hour while they
cleaned up my mess.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.969
Who exactly
cleaned up your mess?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.463
I don't know.
By the time I came back,

14:37.540 --> 14:38.632
Diego was gone,
and the girl's body

14:38.710 --> 14:40.109
was already in my trunk.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.878
Where can we find Diego?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.178
He texted me
later that night.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.899
Said he was booking it
for Brazil.

14:47.080 --> 14:48.308
Where'd you
meet up with him?

14:51.620 --> 14:52.689
Can't tell you that.

14:53.890 --> 14:55.619
Not without
some reCIprOCIty.

14:56.890 --> 14:58.824
_ You think this
is a negotiation?

14:58.890 --> 15:00.949
I want immunity
and witness protection.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.225
My bosses find out I ratted,
I'm a dead man.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.521
Oh.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.292
Okay.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.964
Here's my counteroffer.

15:12.570 --> 15:14.003
Go screw yourself.

15:22.650 --> 15:24.481
How can I make a deal
With some scumbag

15:24.550 --> 15:25.710
who knocks a girl out

15:25.790 --> 15:27.018
and delivers her to
Where she got killed?

15:27.090 --> 15:28.648
Look, I know
he's a piece of shit, okay?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.153
But he could lead us
to Sadie's killer.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.788
We need that address.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.691
Well, I've been
tracking Bobby's movements
using his cell phone

15:33.760 --> 15:35.250
from the night
of Sadie's death.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.592
Here's a list
of the towers

15:36.660 --> 15:38.389
that his cell phone
pinged off of.

15:38.470 --> 15:39.823
Looks like
he started his evening

15:39.900 --> 15:41.731
on the Upper East Side,
then he hit Liberty park.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.859
Where he met
with Sadie.
And after that?

15:43.940 --> 15:46.408
And after that,
he hit an industrial
manufacturing neighborhood

15:46.470 --> 15:47.778
in the South Bronx.

15:47.840 --> 15:49.774
Mostly just a bunch
of meat processing plants

15:49.840 --> 15:51.649
and some other factories,

15:51.710 --> 15:55.419
a coat factory
and an industrial
bakery, to be exact.

15:57.850 --> 15:59.249
CSU's are trying to get
What they can

15:59.320 --> 16:00.981
before the Wind picks up.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.880
Scene's a mess.
Doubt they'll find much.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.889
Al, you may not
have to make a deal.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.951
At Sadie's crime scene,
there was a wrapper.

16:09.030 --> 16:11.328
Southview Bakery.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.198
Come on, a crime syndicate
working out of a bakery?

16:14.270 --> 16:15.464
Do you have
anything better?

16:16.440 --> 16:17.964
No.
So, Jay?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.133
Have some unis
_ meet us there
in unmarked cars.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.575
I have a feeling
we're walking into a room

16:21.640 --> 16:23.676
full of people
who don't want to see us.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.605
NEWSCASTER: With storm surges
expected to be over 10 feet,

16:26.680 --> 16:28.910
flooding and power outages
are expected,

16:28.980 --> 16:32.017
and Mayor de Blasio
is asking that all
non-essential personnel

16:32.090 --> 16:33.352
please remain indoors.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.718
Here we go.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.189
We're going in
on my signal.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.024
Al, wait.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.624
Stand by.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.374
That's him.
That's Lorenzo the Shadow.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.308
That's him?

17:05.390 --> 17:07.017
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

17:21.770 --> 17:22.998
Freeze, police!

17:23.070 --> 17:24.731
Let me see your hands!
Don't move!

17:24.810 --> 17:26.539
Okay, okay,
my hands are up,
just don't shoot.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.872
Don't even
think about it.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.575
Get his gun.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.044
You're making a mistake.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.270
Wouldn't be the first,
and it won't be the last.

17:35.350 --> 17:36.374
Cuff him up.
All right.

17:36.450 --> 17:38.680
What's your name,
big guy?

17:38.750 --> 17:39.887
Huh?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.585
Ah, no I.D.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.252
Oh. You gonna
tell us your name,

17:44.330 --> 17:45.820
or do we just call you
The Shadow?

17:47.430 --> 17:48.454
Or you could call him
"Mr. Shadow,"

17:48.530 --> 17:49.554
keep things formal.

17:50.400 --> 17:51.424
My name is go f...

17:51.500 --> 17:52.762
Don't say
anything, Lorenzo.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.331
Oh, Lorenzo.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.300
See, now that
wasn't so hard, was it?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.679
Nice to meet you, Lorenzo.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.674
You're dead.
I'm sorry, boss.

18:02.740 --> 18:03.775
They already called you
The Shadow, I figured...

18:03.850 --> 18:04.839
All right, shut up.
Both of you.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.002
Who are you?

18:06.080 --> 18:07.377
I'm just a bean counter.

18:08.050 --> 18:09.517
Lot of beans.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.218
You don't know
the half of it.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.689
I'm sure we will,
once we get you back

18:12.750 --> 18:15.548
to Major Crimes,
Steven Patchett.

18:15.620 --> 18:17.429
Call me Stevie.
Everyone does.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.455
OFFICER: We're gonna
transport these guys in.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.259
Right behind you.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.298
You need a new nickname.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.361
You're not in the
shadows anymore.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.660
How about
Lorenzo the Mute?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.968
Did you know 100 people
in the United States

18:37.040 --> 18:38.871
are killed every year
by lightning strikes?

18:38.950 --> 18:41.339
You a weatherman
as well as being
a criminal accountant?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.240
You know, I resent that.
I mean, would you call

18:43.320 --> 18:45.185
the Yankees' accountant
"Yankee Accountant?"

18:45.250 --> 18:46.683
No, you would not.
So, you know,

18:46.750 --> 18:49.355
your characterization
is as lazy as it is
fallacious.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.753
Even though, yes,
my client is technically
a criminal.

18:52.830 --> 18:54.855
Strike that.
Uh, alleged criminal.

18:54.930 --> 18:56.795
You know, I have
an office in West...

18:56.860 --> 18:58.066
Shut up.

18:58.130 --> 19:00.291
I don't care about your
office in Westchester.

19:00.370 --> 19:02.167
Just shut up.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.434
Thank you.
Sure.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.637
I was gonna
shoot him myself.

19:05.710 --> 19:07.507
Get down!

19:10.180 --> 19:11.374
Drive!

19:20.960 --> 19:22.188
Hey, Al.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.524
AL: Jay, listen,
we've been ambushed.

19:24.590 --> 19:27.058
Some of Lorenzo's
guys followed us
and shot up the car.

19:27.130 --> 19:28.256
We're in the Bronx, but...

19:28.330 --> 19:29.627
Whoa, whoa, Al, Al.

19:29.700 --> 19:31.292
Uh, I didn't catch all that.
Can you repeat it?

19:31.370 --> 19:33.634
AL: I think
we've lost 'em for now.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.861
We gotta hole up somewhere.
We're heading towards...

19:35.940 --> 19:37.635
Al?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.439
Al?

19:39.510 --> 19:40.875
Hey, boss?

19:42.210 --> 19:43.768
Carrie and Al
were just ambushed.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.169
Their car
just got shot up.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.399
What do you mean?
Where, Where are they?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.311
I don't know.
Somewhere in the Bronx.

19:48.380 --> 19:49.711
Lost the signal
before they could tell me
exactly where they were.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.782
Look, that narrows it down
to, like, 60 square miles.

19:54.290 --> 19:55.416
I got nothing.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.582
We have to find out
Where they are,

19:56.660 --> 19:57.649
and we have to get them help.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.152
All right.
Come on.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.827
Ah, come on.
It's this frickin' storm.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.197
The whole system's down
because of it.

20:06.270 --> 20:07.464
I can't even get a...
Jay.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.064
Just do whatever the hell
you have to do

20:09.140 --> 20:10.368
and find them,
you got that?

20:10.440 --> 20:12.362
All right.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.406
Okay, so there are
no phone signals

20:15.480 --> 20:16.833
'cause the cell towers
are overloaded.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.707
Do we have coms
with anybody up there?

20:18.780 --> 20:20.338
Uh...

20:21.380 --> 20:22.938
No. It's a mess.

20:23.020 --> 20:24.544
Can't get anything.
They're all out on calls.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.588
Maybe we should go.
Go

20:26.650 --> 20:28.880
Wander around the Bronx with
What, a frickin' megaphone?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.655
We have to find
their location.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.186
Try to get through
to any precincts,

20:32.260 --> 20:34.455
see if there's been
any reports of any
shots fired.

20:34.530 --> 20:37.226
Once we find out
Where they were ambushed,
then we find them.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.621
Yes, ma'am.
All right.

20:52.350 --> 20:54.272
515t has seen
better days. Hey.

20:54.350 --> 20:55.578
Good thing you
remembered this place.

20:55.650 --> 20:56.969
The engine's shot.

20:57.050 --> 20:58.745
Hi, how may I help you?
Carrie Wells, Major Crimes.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.515
Richie Gardner,
Probationary Officer.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.285
You're a probey?
How long you
been on the job?

21:02.360 --> 21:04.385
One week.
Four days, actually.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.155
Okay, well, welcome
to the deep end.

21:06.230 --> 21:08.221
We got a hurricane,
a wanted criminal,

21:08.300 --> 21:09.756
and a bunch of guys
out there with guns

21:09.830 --> 21:12.060
who are trying to find us
so they can set Lorenzo free.

21:12.130 --> 21:13.222
Where are the
holding cells?

21:13.300 --> 21:15.029
Uh, we only
have the one.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.660
Place is under renovation.
It's in the bullpen.

21:17.740 --> 21:18.866
Any guests tonight?

21:18.940 --> 21:20.032
RICHIE: Just the guys
you're checking in.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.372
And here's the keys.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.810
Lock the door,
hunker down.
Storm's coming.

21:28.480 --> 21:29.913
Ah!

21:29.980 --> 21:31.948
Hey, you just ripped
a $2,000 suit, you know,

21:32.020 --> 21:33.112
that's the
fourth violation.
Shut up!

21:33.190 --> 21:34.657
My statutory rights...

21:36.790 --> 21:39.258
Ugh, this cut on my hand
needs medical attention,

21:39.330 --> 21:41.025
now you're legally required
to provide that.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.749
Okay, you know What?
If you shut up,

21:42.830 --> 21:44.229
I will provide you
with medical attention.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.460
No, no, no, wait,

21:45.530 --> 21:46.565
you can't put me
in the cell with him.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.188
He's gonna try and kill me.

21:48.270 --> 21:50.033
"Try" is actually
optimistic on my part.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.863
He is going to
successfully kill me.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.874
And then he'll likely kill
the family I'll never have.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.305
But maybe I could
have that family

21:55.380 --> 21:57.075
if you don't
put me in there.
You talk an awful lot.

21:57.140 --> 21:58.175
Do you know that?
Are you good?

21:59.380 --> 22:01.211
All right,
you know What? Listen.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.510
Shut up.
You talk too much,

22:03.590 --> 22:05.148
way too much.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.380
This is the part
Where you roll over

22:06.450 --> 22:07.712
on _the_whole
organization, huh?

22:07.790 --> 22:09.314
I keep immaculate books.

22:09.390 --> 22:11.358
Well, they're not
actually books, per se,

22:11.430 --> 22:12.681
'cause everything's
on computers these days...

22:12.760 --> 22:14.057
Oh, my God!

22:14.130 --> 22:15.449
But I can give you
a big, juicy collar.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.724
I'm gonna need
a first aid kit.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.062
I'll check with Richie.
Yeah.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.064
You know what?
To give me a big
juicy collar,

22:20.130 --> 22:21.666
I need a witness
Who's brave enough
to testify at trial.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.059
Are you gonna do that?

22:26.410 --> 22:29.732
I swear to you.
Anything you need.

22:29.810 --> 22:33.576
Fine, you can stay
out here with me.

22:33.650 --> 22:36.915
If you shut up
and stop annoying me.

22:36.980 --> 22:38.845
Sit down.
Don't talk.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.717
My anatomy thanks you.

22:44.230 --> 22:46.687
Who are you?
Who are you?

22:46.760 --> 22:48.853
Lieutenant Al _Burns.
One more time.

22:48.930 --> 22:51.626
Who are you?
Oh, I'm Francis Shadez.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.294
Administrative assistant.
I work here.

22:54.370 --> 22:57.066
Okay, if you work here,
can you help me find
a first aid kit?

22:57.140 --> 22:58.266
Yeah.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.228
Sure, it's back here.
I'll show you.

23:03.280 --> 23:04.702
Ah.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.278
Hey.

23:09.350 --> 23:10.374
What, you don't
trust me?

23:11.450 --> 23:12.940
I don't trust anyone.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.623
Shit.
Here you go.

23:17.690 --> 23:20.921
Ah, thank you.
No cell phone reception.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.649
Landlines are still down.
I'll check again.

23:22.730 --> 23:23.958
Go.

23:24.030 --> 23:25.019
Oh, it hurts.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.805
Any word?
Not yet, no.

23:31.870 --> 23:33.735
Working on
Ewers's phone.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.402
He's one of
Lorenzo's top guys.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.731
He's got
all the cell numbers,

23:36.810 --> 23:38.038
so we're gonna run
a track and trace.

23:38.110 --> 23:39.975
Find Lorenzo's troops
before they ﬁnd ours.

23:42.650 --> 23:44.208
We better hurry.
Storm's here.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.918
Hold on.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.182
Cracked it!

23:52.260 --> 23:53.659
Yes!
Nice job.
Okay.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.220
Okay, okay.

23:55.300 --> 23:56.653
All right, I'm entering
phone numbers

23:56.730 --> 23:58.061
of known_ Lorenzo
assoqates,

23:58.130 --> 24:00.018
see if they're on the move.
ALICE: Yeah, go, go, go.

24:07.410 --> 24:09.935
Oh, no.
Oh, my God.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.301
There's a dozen of 'em.

24:12.380 --> 24:14.143
JAY LEE: And look where
they're all headed.

24:14.220 --> 24:18.213
16lst and Grand Concourse.
That's the Slst Precinct.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.814
And that's Where
Carrie and Al
would head for.

24:19.890 --> 24:22.085
Jay, we gotta call 'em.
We gotta warn 'em.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.582
Yep.
Already on it.

24:26.190 --> 24:27.828
CHERIE: Answer.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.788
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
We're sorry, your call
can not be completed.

24:29.860 --> 24:32.465
Come on.
Please check the number
and dial again.

24:32.530 --> 24:34.259
Ah.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.467
Precinct landlines are down.
There's no way to get
through to 'em, boss.

24:36.540 --> 24:40.499
They're surrounded
and they have no idea
What's coming at them.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.082
We're gonna be
stuck here for a while.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.048
I should check the breach
pomts downstairs.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.449
I'll come with you.

25:02.530 --> 25:04.464
Richie. Keep
an eye on him.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.998
Check the landlines,
and, um, if he annoys you,

25:07.070 --> 25:08.992
just, you know, shoot him.

25:14.810 --> 25:17.404
She was, uh...

25:17.480 --> 25:19.948
She was joking,
by the way.

25:20.010 --> 25:22.376
I know you're
a little green, but, uh...

25:22.450 --> 25:24.941
Cops are prone
to bouts of jocularity.

25:25.020 --> 25:28.751
You know,
it, uh, helps relieve
the stress of the job.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.085
I'm not a kid,
and I don't feel the
stress of the job.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.129
Come on, I can see it.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.553
Hey, it's just
two guys talking, right?

25:36.630 --> 25:38.495
I mean, look at you.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.060
You're shaking like a leaf.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.797
You know what?

25:42.870 --> 25:46.260
You will be better off
in the cell.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.005
Oh, come... Come on.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.900
Ah!

25:51.980 --> 25:53.299
You... She said
I could sit here.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.813
Let's go.
Ah.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.009
Go.

26:09.260 --> 26:10.488
RICHIE: They're loose!

26:11.830 --> 26:14.298
The emergency lights
should've kicked on by now.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.497
This place must
have backup power.

26:23.540 --> 26:24.700
Ah!

26:24.780 --> 26:26.145
Hey.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.644
Al, I saw a fuse box
on the way in now.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.917
Maybe it's connected
to the backup generator.

26:35.990 --> 26:39.050
I'll go help Richie.
Watch your ass.

26:39.130 --> 26:40.654
That's What I got
you for, right?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.263
Move a muscle,
it'll be the last breath...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.737
Oh, sorry.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.336
You're quite the badass.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.729
I'll hold onto this.

26:52.810 --> 26:54.277
You think I'm a badass?

26:55.280 --> 26:56.508
Okay.

27:00.680 --> 27:02.011
Bingo, baby.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.412
Come on, come on, come on.

27:04.490 --> 27:05.718
Yes.

27:07.020 --> 27:09.250
What happened?
They overpowered me.

27:09.320 --> 27:11.185
I'm sorry.
Which way did they go?

27:11.260 --> 27:12.955
That way.
All right.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.422
You two stay here.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.095
All right.

27:38.450 --> 27:40.213
Clear.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.297
Clear.

28:20.290 --> 28:21.894
Clear.

28:28.870 --> 28:30.565
I'll take the stairs.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.198
You take the hall.

29:01.470 --> 29:02.664
Oh!

29:02.740 --> 29:03.934
Shit.

29:04.570 --> 29:05.901
Anything?

29:05.970 --> 29:07.699
Nothing.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.159
Don't move.
Okay, don't shoot.

29:40.240 --> 29:41.275
Get out.
Ow!

29:41.340 --> 29:42.739
Ow, ow, ow.

29:50.550 --> 29:52.245
Take it easy.
Ow!

29:52.320 --> 29:53.787
Okay, okay.
All right.

29:53.860 --> 29:55.589
Just... Ah!

30:02.030 --> 30:03.019
Now what?

30:03.100 --> 30:05.364
We wait for this storm
to blow over,

30:05.430 --> 30:06.966
then we all
head downtown.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.529
CARRIE: Damn it.

30:19.210 --> 30:20.768
Lorenzo's boys
are back in town.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.019
Al, we got
guys with guns
headed this way.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.226
How much ammo you got?

30:36.300 --> 30:37.756
Four in this clip,
one full.

30:37.830 --> 30:39.388
I got one clip, it...

30:39.470 --> 30:40.596
It's not gonna be enough.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.303
Richie, we need ammo.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.133
Well, ever since
the construction
started to happen,

30:48.210 --> 30:49.507
it's been locked
in the Captain's safe.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.002
He's the only one
that knows the code.

30:52.310 --> 30:53.868
They're trying to break
the front door down!

30:53.950 --> 30:55.474
Let's get down there.

30:56.120 --> 30:57.212
You stay here.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.157
Remember how I always
wanted to be more like

31:07.230 --> 31:08.254
Butch Cassidy?

31:08.330 --> 31:09.854
This isn't what I meant.

31:09.930 --> 31:12.069
You know, I'm Butch Cassidy.
You're the Sundance Kid.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.119
Is this really
a time to...

31:23.110 --> 31:24.247
Ah!

31:24.310 --> 31:26.278
One clip left.

31:26.350 --> 31:27.669
You guys need
more ammo, right?

31:27.750 --> 31:29.615
How'd you get into
the Captain's safe?

31:29.680 --> 31:31.409
Well, he and I shared
some things.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.548
This isn't for a Glock.

31:32.620 --> 31:34.850
I'll take it.
All right.

31:34.920 --> 31:36.911
Okay.
I'll check the
back entrance.

31:36.990 --> 31:38.321
I'll cover you.
Go, go, go.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.032
Don't move.
Al.

31:53.110 --> 31:54.429
What the hell are you
doing here?

31:54.510 --> 31:55.636
Figured you could
use the help.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.132
So you came
through a hurricane?

31:57.840 --> 31:59.603
Whoo!
Hey, boys.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.617
Hey, we came to the rescue.
It's crazy out there.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.615
It's crazy in here too,
and I'm not sure
we needed rescumg.

32:09.460 --> 32:10.882
Could use your
help, though.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.587
Okay.
All right.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.491
Let's go.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.795
MAN: Give us Lorenzo
and we're gone!

32:20.370 --> 32:21.530
Hey.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.669
Welcome to the party.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.935
I think we can keep 'em
pinned down from here.

32:25.010 --> 32:26.034
Go.

32:35.750 --> 32:36.876
I'm... I'm out.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.582
Okay, listen to me.

32:39.650 --> 32:41.117
Richie, is there
a way out of here?

32:41.190 --> 32:43.909
Some kind of obscure way
they might not know about?

32:43.990 --> 32:45.958
Uh, the... Down
in the basement,

32:46.030 --> 32:47.679
there's a door
with a deadend alley.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.296
Great.
Okay, you and Richie

32:49.360 --> 32:50.759
take Lorenzo
and the accountant,

32:50.830 --> 32:52.627
see if there's a way out
through that alley.

32:52.700 --> 32:53.769
We'll hold 'em off
from here.

32:53.830 --> 32:54.899
Okay.
Go.

33:15.960 --> 33:18.588
Ah! NO!

33:18.660 --> 33:20.480
Get u |
Ahip'

33:20.890 --> 33:22.323
Oh!

33:22.400 --> 33:24.163
Please be gentle.
This is my calculating hand.

33:27.170 --> 33:29.138
Drop the gun,
or he's dead.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.374
I said drop it.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.133
Drop it!

33:37.210 --> 33:38.541
It's okay, Richie.

33:41.950 --> 33:43.872
Keys.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.645
Let's go, keys!

33:48.260 --> 33:50.251
Pick 'em up, Stevie.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.452
Let's go,
get the keys!

33:54.530 --> 33:56.020
Okay, okay, okay.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.789
Come on, come on!

34:00.770 --> 34:01.839
Get 'em off me.

34:08.080 --> 34:09.968
The storm's almost over
and this place is gonna
be surrounded.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.541
You're not gonna
get outta here.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.641
You bastard.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.984
You're my ticket
outta here.

34:19.050 --> 34:21.041
Put the cuffs on her.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.656
You mean our ticket,
don't ya?

34:25.190 --> 34:26.782
Come on, put the
cuffs on her.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.327
Ah!

34:29.460 --> 34:30.893
Oh!

34:36.500 --> 34:37.728
Ah!

34:48.150 --> 34:49.879
Pretty badass
for an accountant.

34:54.620 --> 34:55.917
We gotta get
Richie upstairs.

35:10.470 --> 35:11.835
Let's finish this.
You ready?

35:11.910 --> 35:12.968
Born ready, boss.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.473
Francis, stay back.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.030
I'd like
to stay with him,

35:16.110 --> 35:17.634
if that's okay with you.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.348
Just stay close, okay?

35:19.410 --> 35:20.707
I will.
All right.

35:25.020 --> 35:26.578
Ah!

35:26.650 --> 35:28.481
Okay, okay.

35:28.560 --> 35:29.982
Get him down
on the floor.

35:30.890 --> 35:32.380
He can rest.
Ah.

35:32.460 --> 35:34.428
Remain steady.
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

35:34.500 --> 35:36.149
Ow.

35:43.870 --> 35:46.304
JOANNE: I know about
this guy, Lorenzo.

35:46.370 --> 35:47.837
A fi re destroyed
his foster home.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.901
Left him with a nasty
scar on his arm.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.959
So, uh, Stevie.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.783
How long you been
Lorenzo's accountant for?

36:03.860 --> 36:05.487
Uh...
I don't know.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.050
Maybe about a year or so?

36:08.090 --> 36:09.193
I was on my
way out, though.

36:09.260 --> 36:11.148
I don't think he liked
the way I did business.

36:13.730 --> 36:15.436
Get down!

36:18.240 --> 36:20.060
That's odd.

36:20.140 --> 36:21.402
Seems like
he was protecting you

36:21.480 --> 36:23.107
when we got shot at
in the car.

36:23.180 --> 36:24.772
Right.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.078
More like
I was in his way
or something.

36:27.480 --> 36:30.972
So, uh, so,
you think the judge
will go easy on me

36:31.050 --> 36:32.540
if you tell him
I saved your life?

36:32.620 --> 36:34.417
No.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.583
I don't think that's
gonna happen, Lorenzo.

36:37.690 --> 36:38.850
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:38.930 --> 36:41.558
Excuse me?
Smart.

36:41.630 --> 36:44.622
Hiding in plain sight
as the accountant.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.668
Hiding?

36:46.730 --> 36:49.198
Okay, are you sure
you didn't take a blow
to the head too?

36:49.270 --> 36:52.137
As a boy, Lorenzo was...

36:53.240 --> 36:54.832
Was involved in a fire.

36:54.910 --> 36:56.901
His arm was badly burned.

36:56.980 --> 36:58.379
And I imagine the scars

36:58.450 --> 37:00.873
look a _lot like
What I just saw
on your arm.

37:00.950 --> 37:04.545
So, uh...
If I'm Lorenzo...

37:04.620 --> 37:07.487
Then, like, Why...
Why didn't I kill you
when I had the chance?

37:07.550 --> 37:09.279
Too smart.

37:09.360 --> 37:12.852
You're not gonna
blow the cover you spent
years building, are you?

37:12.930 --> 37:16.422
Easier to shoot the guy
you paid to pretend
to be Lorenzo.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.822
You're a hero,
'cause you saved me.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.595
You cut a deal,
agree to testify,

37:21.670 --> 37:24.969
post bail, and then
you disappear

37:25.040 --> 37:26.302
into the shadows.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.009
My God.

37:29.080 --> 37:30.707
What?

37:37.950 --> 37:40.180
Oh.

37:42.260 --> 37:43.852
Pretty smart theory.

37:46.590 --> 37:49.889
Course,
you got nothing
to hold me on.

38:05.610 --> 38:06.838
Your belt.

38:09.680 --> 38:11.841
You strangled Sadie
with your belt.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.342
The markings are
the same as the studs,

38:13.420 --> 38:15.115
and I bet forensics
can prove it.

38:15.190 --> 38:17.784
You are good.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.819
You know...

38:24.000 --> 38:25.467
I know about you.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.568
The famous memory cop.

38:30.140 --> 38:31.835
I know about you, too.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.370
Lorenzo.
Sad little boy.

38:37.240 --> 38:39.549
Orphaned.
Ignored.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.612
A victim of the
foster care system.

38:44.320 --> 38:45.981
I feel sorry for that boy,

38:47.290 --> 38:48.757
but I won't hesitate

38:48.820 --> 38:51.550
to shoot the
cold-blooded murderer

38:51.630 --> 38:53.359
standing in front of me.

38:55.730 --> 38:58.051
That's touching.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.496
But you know,
you should feel
sorry for yourself.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.389
You see, I'm good
with numbers.

39:04.570 --> 39:07.903
Like, how many bullets
were in that gun,

39:07.970 --> 39:11.235
and how many
bullets went out.

39:11.310 --> 39:13.346
I could have used one shot
to kill that big moron,

39:13.410 --> 39:15.219
but I used four.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.077
I emptied it.

39:17.150 --> 39:20.483
Pretty clever,
pretending the gun
isloaded.

39:20.550 --> 39:22.108
Oh, but it's empty.

39:23.660 --> 39:24.888
You know it.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.882
And I know it.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.848
I don't need bullets
to take you out.

39:40.910 --> 39:41.979
Let's see.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.047
Ah!

39:54.860 --> 39:57.078
I'm sorry, was that
your calculating hand?

40:11.040 --> 40:13.167
MAN: Hey, no joke.
It's a true story.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.969
Saw, like, ten guys,
all myself.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.576
I had nine bullets.
It's weird.

40:16.640 --> 40:18.278
Hey, you know, I...
All right.

40:20.250 --> 40:21.911
Hey.

40:21.980 --> 40:23.516
Hey, you feelin'
all right there, kid?

40:23.580 --> 40:26.242
You okay? Yeah,
it's all good. Okay?

40:26.320 --> 40:27.742
JAY LEE: So, you know, maybe

40:27.820 --> 40:29.788
it's a good idea for you
to talk to a counselor.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.088
Oh.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.754
But you know, listen,
you handled yourself

40:33.830 --> 40:34.956
really well back there.

40:35.030 --> 40:36.622
I knew you had
my back, so...

40:36.700 --> 40:38.725
Hey, Francis.
Hey, tell me,

40:38.800 --> 40:40.529
What do you think
about my boy Jay here?

40:40.600 --> 40:42.465
He's kind of
a hero, isn't he?

40:42.540 --> 40:44.030
You let him do
all your talking
for you?

40:44.100 --> 40:45.761
No, I don't.
Danny, uh...

40:45.840 --> 40:47.034
Yeah.
I got this, okay?

40:47.110 --> 40:48.361
Oh. Oh, I bet you do.

40:48.440 --> 40:49.577
Okay, yes, I...
Yeah?

40:49.640 --> 40:52.541
Okay, yes.
Thank you very much.

40:52.610 --> 40:54.407
Look, you were really
cool under fire.
Thank you.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.744
Really, really,
really standup job.

41:02.360 --> 41:03.918
That was crazy.
Gonna take your tie off.

41:03.990 --> 41:05.127
A little better.
CARRIE: Hey!

41:05.190 --> 41:06.919
ALL: Hey!

41:06.990 --> 41:09.254
I can't believe you
brought us all out here
and it's closed.

41:09.330 --> 41:11.218
It's not closed.
It's a little surprise.

41:11.300 --> 41:13.689
It's closed to the public,
but open to us.

41:13.770 --> 41:15.795
AW. That's sweet.
Thank you.

41:15.870 --> 41:16.996
What?

41:17.070 --> 41:19.436
Uh... What is this?

41:19.510 --> 41:23.002
That is a love meter.
It can test your pa55ion.

41:23.080 --> 41:24.377
Oh, really?
Well, no offense,

41:24.440 --> 41:25.941
I could find other
ways to, you know...

41:26.010 --> 41:27.079
ALL: Oh!
I'm sure you could!

41:27.150 --> 41:28.469
JAY LEE: Right.
AL: Wait.

41:28.550 --> 41:29.574
Who's first?
No, hold on a second.

41:29.650 --> 41:30.969
Shots.
Oh.

41:31.050 --> 41:33.610
To say thank you,
thank you, here.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.282
Oh, my.
You gotta do it
all in one.

41:35.360 --> 41:36.679
Oh, my God!

41:36.760 --> 41:40.127
All right, to my partner,
Al, who saves my ass

41:40.190 --> 41:42.226
every time, and,
um, you know,

41:42.300 --> 41:43.790
occasionally
I save his too.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.919
I'll drink to that.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.820
To Al.
And to the
rest of you,

41:47.900 --> 41:49.538
thanks for being
there for us.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.862
Hey, we're there
for each other, right?

41:50.940 --> 41:52.532
AL: Always.
Ah, all right, go!

41:52.610 --> 41:53.929
Oh!

41:54.010 --> 41:55.204
Mmm!
CARRIE: Oh, my God.

41:55.280 --> 41:56.838
Oh, it all went
down my front.
Ah!

41:56.910 --> 41:58.400
Hey, J-bones!
Mmm?

41:58.480 --> 41:59.572
Oh, gosh.
It's you, baby.

41:59.650 --> 42:01.003
What?
You're first up,
come on.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.775
Oh, no, no, no.
Let's go.

42:02.850 --> 42:04.147
Come on!
Jay, come on!

42:04.220 --> 42:05.915
Why can't you
have fun? Come on.
Oh, okay.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.514
Oh, my God,
that's horrible.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.615
Go ahead.
Okay, um...

42:09.690 --> 42:10.816
What do Iwhat do I do?

42:10.890 --> 42:12.983
You grab it
and you squeeze it.

42:13.060 --> 42:14.459
Grab and squeeze it!
Grab it and squeeze it!

42:14.530 --> 42:16.157
CARRIE: That's it, go!
Okay.

42:19.800 --> 42:21.734
ALL: Oh!

42:23.940 --> 42:25.601
You are uncontrollable.

42:25.670 --> 42:26.864
MAN: Oh, my God.

42:30.780 --> 42:32.509
How much you pay the guy
to rig the machine?

42:32.580 --> 42:33.979
You know me so well.
