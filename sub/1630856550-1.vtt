00:02.480 --> 00:04.613
[dramatic music]

00:05.788 --> 00:07.094
[Cortana] Chief?

00:08.530 --> 00:09.705
Wake up.

00:09.748 --> 00:11.272
I need you to wake up.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.364
Please, wake up.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.932
He'’s dying.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.674
We'’re losing him!

00:24.502 --> 00:25.895
Sever the connection.

00:25.938 --> 00:28.289
[jumbled radio transmissions]

00:35.339 --> 00:37.298
[Highroller] Condors dispatched
to grid one, niner,

00:37.341 --> 00:39.169
seven, niner, six, six.

00:39.213 --> 00:42.477
Stand by for ETA on station.
How copy?

00:42.520 --> 00:44.957
[Nix] Good copy, Highroller.
Evac on the way.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.266
[radio chatter]

00:49.310 --> 00:51.138
[Shepherd] Silver, this
is Shepherd requesting

00:51.181 --> 00:52.356
support in the village, over.

00:54.532 --> 00:55.490
[Kai] Chief.

00:58.493 --> 01:01.017
Shepherd 7, this is Silver 1.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.150
Inbound to your location. Out.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.760
Riz, on me.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.153
Maintain overwatch.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.545
[Vannak] Kai doesn'’t
need a spotter.

01:07.589 --> 01:10.809
Maintain overwatch, Vannak.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.811
I know this isn'’t
what we trained for.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.551
Try to stay focused
on the mission.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.080
-[Spartans thumping]
-[tense music]

01:20.123 --> 01:22.169
-He serious?
-Don'’t start.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.996
What mission?

01:24.039 --> 01:25.389
Third civilian
evac in six months.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.131
-This is babysitting.
-For his protection.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.307
Yeah, for babies.

01:30.351 --> 01:35.573

[townspeople chatter]

01:43.059 --> 01:45.453
[radio chatter continues]

01:51.589 --> 01:53.025
Make a hole!

01:55.202 --> 01:57.160
We really need you
to move down, sir.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.380
Corporal, what'’s the hold-up?

01:59.423 --> 02:01.556
It'’s this lady, sir,
she'’s some sort of shaman.

02:01.599 --> 02:03.427
Priest person.
A shaman priest person?

02:03.471 --> 02:05.560
I don'’t know what
you call it exactly.

02:05.603 --> 02:07.257
I'’m a Baptist.

02:07.301 --> 02:09.172
Corporal, did you explain
politely and clearly

02:09.216 --> 02:11.174
that this is
a temporary evacuation,

02:11.218 --> 02:13.045
and we are operating
under the full authority

02:13.089 --> 02:18.573
of the UNSC 709,
Section Four, Subsection A?

02:18.616 --> 02:20.923
Yes, sir. I don'’t think
she wants to comply.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.577
Then we comply
her ass, corporal.

02:22.620 --> 02:23.621
Ma'’am, place your hands--

02:23.665 --> 02:26.363
[crowd shouting]

02:26.407 --> 02:27.582
Stand down!

02:27.625 --> 02:28.626
Lower your weapons!

02:28.670 --> 02:31.412
[Chief] Kai, talk to me.

02:31.454 --> 02:35.024
Our captain continues to
win hearts and minds, Chief.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.983
[Chief] Hold the commentary,
just give me the sit-rep.

02:38.027 --> 02:42.553
[Kai] Shepherd is interfacing
with local leadership.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.165
I make 20 possible hostiles.

02:45.208 --> 02:46.644
[Chief] Copy that, Silver 2.

02:51.388 --> 02:55.000
Been meaning to ask you,
did you take your pellet out?

02:55.043 --> 02:57.177
What are you talking about?

02:57.220 --> 02:59.091
Riz say something to you,
'’cause you know she's--

02:59.135 --> 03:01.398
No one said anything. Relax.

03:01.442 --> 03:02.660
It'’s just a feeling.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.795
I pulled it three weeks ago.

03:06.838 --> 03:09.014
-And?
-And what?

03:09.058 --> 03:11.147
-Do you feel any different?
-No.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.675
I watch programs sometimes.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
Programs?

03:19.721 --> 03:21.462
Like, about animals and stuff.

03:21.505 --> 03:23.072
Oh.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.118
-Don'’t do that.
-Wait, hold on.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.644
You see that?
Call it in.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.167
It'’s a flash.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.603
-A flicker.
-[tense music]

03:32.647 --> 03:34.736
You want me to
call in a flicker?

03:34.779 --> 03:35.954
Do you see it or not?

03:38.087 --> 03:40.959
Covenant. They come here,
they see your little village,

03:41.003 --> 03:42.396
they will burn it.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.528
Plasma. You understand?

03:44.572 --> 03:47.662
You, your people, all this,
turned into glass.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.795
Get that translator down here.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.667
-Sir.
-I understand you.

03:52.710 --> 03:54.408
Good. That'’s great,
now I'’d appreciate--

03:54.451 --> 03:56.366
I understand you'’re
the same that came before.

03:56.410 --> 03:58.542
-Excuse me?
-To our first home.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.109
Forty-two years ago.

04:00.152 --> 04:03.112
On that planet, it was warm.

04:03.155 --> 04:05.114
On that planet, there were fish.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.898
Ma'’am, I'm trying
to help you people.

04:06.942 --> 04:08.552
-I'’m trying to--
-To save us.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.946
Yes, that'’s what
you said the last time.

04:10.989 --> 04:15.124
Before you scattered our
people to planets like this.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.690
I don'’t think we
will need your help.

04:19.519 --> 04:22.566
[townspeople gasp]

04:24.176 --> 04:26.701
What'’s the problem, Captain?

04:26.744 --> 04:28.485
You should know I'’m authorized
to use whatever force

04:28.529 --> 04:33.273
I deem necessary
to protect you, ma'’am.

04:33.316 --> 04:36.450
Sir, still no
contact with Bravo.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.147
You'’ll excuse me.

04:40.628 --> 04:43.674
-Not everything has a soul.
-[crowd chattering]

04:43.718 --> 04:46.590
Some things, not all.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.898
Some places have souls,
like this one.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.073
[crowd chattering]

04:51.116 --> 04:53.597
Did you know that?

04:53.641 --> 04:54.772
It'’s true.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.777
He'’s going to think about it.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.476
[crowd laughing]

05:02.519 --> 05:05.957
Our faith tells us
that to leave our planet

05:06.001 --> 05:09.744
in its time of torment is
no different than to abandon

05:09.787 --> 05:11.311
a dying child or parent.

05:15.053 --> 05:18.448
Have you family, Spartan?

05:20.450 --> 05:21.582
Have you faith?

05:25.803 --> 05:27.501
No.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.764
These things are not
for you, are they?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.550
[Highroller] This is
Highroller FLEETCOM EWS

05:33.594 --> 05:35.596
tracking Covenant
CPV-Class Destroyer

05:35.639 --> 05:37.511
approaching Sanctuary.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.513
ETA one, one mikes,
this is not a drill.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.428
[soldiers shouting]

05:41.471 --> 05:43.255
Where are my goddamn Condors?

05:43.299 --> 05:44.953
Sir, Bravo'’s somewhere
up on that hill.

05:44.996 --> 05:46.650
Comms are out, they got
no idea what'’s coming.

05:46.694 --> 05:47.738
What you want me to do?
We'’ve got 19 minutes--

05:47.782 --> 05:49.305
I'’ll get your marines.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.611
What? No. Hell no.
I can'’t risk--

05:50.654 --> 05:53.004
Sir, let him go, please.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.571
I'’ll bring them back, sir.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.181
Dust-off is in
one-five, you copy?

05:56.225 --> 05:57.574
Riz, get to the Condors.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.141
Help the villagers evac.

05:59.183 --> 06:01.535
-Copy that, Chief.
-[Nix] Go, Marines!

06:01.578 --> 06:03.406
Ten mikes, then this
whole planet is glass.

to your 12.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.731
Well, that'’s straight up.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.951
The Nubian Ibex can scale
an 80-degree slope, over.

06:26.995 --> 06:31.173
-What?
-What?

06:31.216 --> 06:34.698

[Vannak]
Approaching the ridge.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.283
You should hit the road
on the other side, Chief.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.633
I'’m going to lose him
in that fog.

06:56.677 --> 06:59.201
[tense music]

07:14.912 --> 07:18.263
[eerie radio interference]

07:23.660 --> 07:27.577
Silver 3, you hearing
this interference, over?

07:27.621 --> 07:29.710
-Silver 3.
-[Vannak] Affirmative.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.581
But your signal is
breaking up, over.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.675
I see you on the marker.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.939
Confirm contact
with Bravo Team, over.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.290
Negative.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.944
Just the vehicles.

07:49.207 --> 07:52.341
[Vannak] Sit-rep
eight, shit, nine.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.995
It'’s a bad copy, 3.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.909
Come again.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.346
[Vannak] You got six
minutes before those

07:57.389 --> 07:58.347
Covenant ships arrive.

07:58.390 --> 07:59.957
We'’re out of time.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.959
Copy that.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.658
You and Kai get those
people on the Condors.

08:04.701 --> 08:05.702
I'’m just going
to check on something.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.791
[Vannak] Negative.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.837
If you do not turn back
now, you will not make it.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.578
Chief?

08:11.621 --> 08:14.668
-Don'’t wait up.
-[tense music]

08:18.976 --> 08:21.631

08:21.675 --> 08:24.895
-[soldiers shouting]
-Oh, come on.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.681
Hold fire!
Hold fire, Blue!

08:31.467 --> 08:33.991
-Shit.
-It'’s a Spartan.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.428
Master Chief.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.648
-You Bravo?
-We'’re Bravo.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.258
-Communications team.
-I know.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.782
I can tell from your aim.

08:41.825 --> 08:42.826
Where'’s the rest of your unit?

08:42.870 --> 08:44.306
We were out by the relay.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.613
Fog came in, comms went down.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.179
Couldn'’t find anyone.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.400
Got separated,
tried calling out.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.881
Okay. I'’ll try
to find your buddies,

08:53.924 --> 08:55.970
but we got to get you
off this mountain.

08:56.013 --> 08:58.189
Shepherd X-Ray,
this is Silver 1.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.235
I'’ve got elements
of Bravo Team.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.802
Requesting exfil.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.762
-Shepherd X-Ray?
-There'’s no comms here.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.851
Interference from the relay.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.331
It'’s probably
a magnetic anomaly.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.463
Oh, for the last time.

09:11.507 --> 09:13.727
It is not a goddamn
magnetic anomaly.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.599
-Shut your holes. Both of you.
-Okay.

09:16.643 --> 09:20.037
Come on. Let'’s move.
On me.

09:20.081 --> 09:21.299
Rand, let'’s go.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.260
What?

09:25.303 --> 09:26.870
What'’s the problem, Private?

09:26.914 --> 09:29.003
Private Rand thinks
he saw something in the fog.

09:29.046 --> 09:31.875
Private Rand thinks that if
we make noise or if we move,

09:31.919 --> 09:32.789
-then we'’re gonna--
-[Rand yells]

09:32.833 --> 09:34.574
Run.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.010
-Go!

09:49.284 --> 09:50.807
Pick up that weapon.

09:57.509 --> 09:59.642
What'’s your name, Corporal?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.078
Perez.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.863
Stay close to me, Perez.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.126
I can'’t see anything.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.214
I think they'’re gone.

10:06.257 --> 10:09.478
No. They'’re close.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.001
How do you know?

10:11.045 --> 10:13.047
The smell.
Move!

Corporal?

[solemn music]

12:22.306 --> 12:23.786
Perez?

12:32.969 --> 12:34.275
-I got you, Marine.
-[Perez groans]

12:34.318 --> 12:35.929
I got you.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.151
Kai, we got to go.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.587
One more minute!

14:09.631 --> 14:11.111
Come on, Chief.

-[ship explodes]
-[townspeople screaming]

14:22.818 --> 14:24.559
It'’s getting
a little warm in here.

Kai, you copy?

14:26.300 --> 14:29.346
[dramatic music]

14:54.502 --> 14:56.591
Find your faith, Spartan.

14:56.634 --> 14:58.245
I have seen your death.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.463
It comes soon.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.950
Chief, let'’s go.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.438
[woman]
Stay with me.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.490
-[loud banging]
-[Keyes] Welcome back.

17:37.969 --> 17:41.582
I know that was difficult.

17:41.625 --> 17:44.889
I don'’t expect you to like it,
but we have to accept it.

17:44.933 --> 17:47.588
Bear in mind,
would'’ve been a lot worse.

17:47.631 --> 17:52.071
Admiral, we need to debrief
on what we ran into out there.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.290
What you saw in Sanctuary
has been happening across

17:54.334 --> 17:55.509
all of the outer colonies.

17:59.165 --> 18:02.559
While you were deployed,
we lost Madrigal.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.518
We lost Estuary.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.260
And FLEETCOM predicts
that the Covenant will glass

18:07.303 --> 18:10.480
-Fumirole next.
-Sir, this is different.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.700
The Covenant
was already there,

18:12.743 --> 18:14.484
on Sanctuary before
they glassed it.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.619
Doesn'’t make sense, does it?

18:18.662 --> 18:21.752
If your plan is to glass
a planet, why invade it first?

18:21.796 --> 18:23.493
Put it in your report.

18:23.537 --> 18:25.321
ONI will conduct intel analysis.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.454
We don'’t need ONI
to tell us what we saw.

18:27.497 --> 18:28.411
Sorry.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.632
First time down here.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.634
No one told me it'’s
like a maze, isn'’t it?

18:40.467 --> 18:42.469
Well, please don'’t
mind me. Carry on.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.253
Sir, if I may.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.560
Who the hell is this guy?

18:46.603 --> 18:50.259
Mr. Ackerson is
Dr. Halsey'’s replacement.

18:50.303 --> 18:51.782
Replacement, sir?

18:51.826 --> 18:53.828
Director of
the Spartan program.

18:53.871 --> 18:57.005
Oh, that'’s very
generous, Admiral.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.747
But no one can
replace Dr. Halsey.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.357
She was one of a kind.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.838
-Is.
-Hm?

19:03.881 --> 19:05.753
You said was.

19:05.796 --> 19:06.928
-Did I?
-She'’s not dead.

19:06.971 --> 19:10.366
No, no, of course not, no.

19:10.410 --> 19:14.457
Our Dr. Halsey is nothing
if not a survivor.

19:14.501 --> 19:17.634
I can only hope she survives
long enough to face the full

19:17.678 --> 19:20.376
consequences of her actions,
wouldn'’t you agree?

19:23.988 --> 19:24.902
Look.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.516
I'’m not here to
replace Dr. Halsey

19:29.559 --> 19:31.518
or to dismantle her work,

19:31.561 --> 19:33.955
problematic as it may be.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.304
No, I'’m here...

19:37.001 --> 19:38.481
because I believe in you.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.529
And I believe in this program.

19:42.572 --> 19:45.358
Point is, I need you

19:45.401 --> 19:47.838
to be the very best
operators you can be.

19:47.882 --> 19:49.840
Well, you can start by
telling FLEETCOM

19:49.884 --> 19:51.277
to let us off the leash.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.626
We need real combat missions.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.541
Mr. Ackerson, this is--

19:54.584 --> 19:56.760
Vannak-134.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.197
Of course it is.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.764
And this is Kai-125.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.462
Big fan.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.204
Riz-028. Good to see
you back on your feet.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.382
And the Master Chief.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.082
It'’s an honor.

20:18.608 --> 20:21.655
Keeping the enemy engaged in the
outer colonies is the mission.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.352
We keep the fight out
there, we have peace here,

20:23.396 --> 20:25.354
people feel safe.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.616
Are they?

20:29.271 --> 20:32.231
We will turn this around,
I assure you.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.802
Well.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.414
I have taken enough
of your time.

20:41.457 --> 20:42.328
Carry on, Admiral.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.466
Very well.
Ten-hour leave.

20:50.510 --> 20:53.208
Medical needs to clear each
of you before you'’re relieved.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.470
Sir.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.168
Who is he?

21:00.346 --> 21:01.869
He'’s the boss.

21:01.912 --> 21:05.351
[tense music]

21:12.575 --> 21:15.274
[alarm buzzing]

21:17.101 --> 21:19.669
[dance music]

21:19.713 --> 21:22.150
[Minnie] Welcome one...

21:22.193 --> 21:25.675
and welcome all to this,

21:25.719 --> 21:30.027
our humble pile of rock!

21:30.071 --> 21:32.073
[Minnie laughing]

21:32.116 --> 21:33.683
Bring them in!

21:33.727 --> 21:36.077
Come on, darlings,
don'’t be shy!

21:36.120 --> 21:37.644
In you come!

21:37.687 --> 21:39.254
Come on, now.

21:39.298 --> 21:44.564
Now, this is lot 436,

21:44.607 --> 21:47.871
hailing from planets former
and parts various.

21:47.915 --> 21:52.180
And hey, hey, no visible
disease in these ones.

21:52.223 --> 21:53.399
[crowd laughing]

21:53.442 --> 21:55.923
Now here, we'’ve got a pair.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.447
And your Minnie'’s
kind-hearted,

21:58.491 --> 22:00.667
so they never will
be parted, bless them.

22:00.710 --> 22:02.451
What'’s your names, darlings?

22:02.495 --> 22:04.540
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh?

22:04.584 --> 22:07.021
-Too late.
-[crowd laughing]

22:07.064 --> 22:09.066
Go on, boy.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.678
Tell him who you are.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.462
Felix from Harvest.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.682
[crowd chattering]

22:15.725 --> 22:17.597
We escaped the glassing
on a fuel barge.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.382
Me, my sister, my mom
got split up on Sedra.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.384
I don'’t where they are now.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.213
Six months, seven planets,
no one would take us.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.041
[Vera] What'’s his trade?

22:27.084 --> 22:28.347
Merchants mate.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.958
Botanical fibers mostly.
Metals, salt.

22:31.001 --> 22:32.786
-Oh!
-[crowd laughing]

22:32.829 --> 22:36.355
Now what are you
supposed to be, eh?

22:36.398 --> 22:38.792
Oh, thief.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.794
Oh, kidnapper!

22:40.837 --> 22:42.578
Thug.

22:42.622 --> 22:46.756
And oh, oh!
What do we have here?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.977
-[Minnie groans]
-You don'’t want to know.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.719
[blows land hard]

22:54.547 --> 22:56.810
-A killer!
-[crowd cheering]

22:56.853 --> 22:59.160
And a liar!

22:59.203 --> 23:03.033
Oh, you see?
[laughing]

23:03.077 --> 23:07.951
-[Minnie shouting]
-[crowding cheering]

23:11.215 --> 23:14.088
[Minnie laughing]

23:14.131 --> 23:18.701
Most will be sent back into
the merciless void of space.

23:18.745 --> 23:22.488
But for the lucky few,
in exchange for asylum,

23:22.531 --> 23:26.666
these persons submit
to indentured service

23:26.709 --> 23:29.799
for the next two years.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.801
Selection!

23:31.845 --> 23:35.849
What say you?

23:35.892 --> 23:38.634
[crowd shouting]

23:43.073 --> 23:44.248
Here.

23:46.729 --> 23:47.687
Him?

23:47.730 --> 23:50.777
Yeah!

23:50.820 --> 23:53.649
-Tag him, then. Tag him!
-What? What?

23:53.693 --> 23:55.825
[gun snaps]

23:55.869 --> 23:57.653
The man'’s a criminal!

23:57.697 --> 24:00.090
[Minnie] No.
A Criminal? Where?

24:00.134 --> 24:03.398
Listen to me,
I have something you want.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.835
I very much doubt that, sugar.

24:05.879 --> 24:09.535
I know the location of...
of a thing of great value.

24:09.578 --> 24:12.015
Of a thing of great value?

24:12.059 --> 24:14.540
Think you'’re the first man to
walk into a roomful of pirates

24:14.583 --> 24:16.237
with promises of treasure?

24:16.280 --> 24:19.066
Not treasure.
A bounty.

24:20.328 --> 24:21.851
For Catherine Halsey.

24:21.895 --> 24:27.204
-[crowd murmuring]
-[Minnie laughing]

24:33.907 --> 24:36.518
If you know where Halsey is,

24:36.562 --> 24:38.825
why not collect
the bounty yourself?

24:38.868 --> 24:40.653
I'’m no bounty hunter.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.785
Just a merchant'’s mate, sir.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.874
And the thing is, see,
the place they got her,

24:44.918 --> 24:46.963
it ain'’t so easy to get to.

24:47.007 --> 24:49.923
On account of having to wade
through all the bullshit?

24:49.966 --> 24:53.970
[crowd laughing]

24:54.014 --> 24:56.669
So, I imagine you'’ll be wanting
a share of this bounty, then.

24:56.712 --> 24:59.106
Well, times being
what they are, sir,

24:59.149 --> 25:03.066
I suppose the right to live
free among you fine folk

25:03.110 --> 25:04.546
would be payment enough for me.

25:07.636 --> 25:12.075
-[laughing]
-[all laughing]

25:12.119 --> 25:13.468
Get him out of here.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.776
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, my darling.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.778
-And come on in!
-I'’m telling the truth!

25:18.821 --> 25:21.781
There you go,
there'’s the next one!

25:21.824 --> 25:23.260
Give us the next ones!

25:23.304 --> 25:25.915
Plenty more
where they came from.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.003
Come on, now!

25:27.047 --> 25:28.962
Come on!

25:29.005 --> 25:31.791
[crowd cheering]

25:34.663 --> 25:37.318
[door sliding]

25:57.033 --> 25:59.993
[static hissing]

26:03.300 --> 26:05.172
-[gunfire]
-[soldier shouting]

26:05.215 --> 26:06.826
[Ackerson] John.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.784
Come in, please.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.751
I know what you'’re thinking.
Sorry. Three weeks.

26:18.794 --> 26:20.840
Haven'’t done anything
with the place.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.712
You know someone suggested
I should get a plant.

26:28.630 --> 26:33.635
Ah...
So, met with your team,

26:33.679 --> 26:35.594
each of them
remarkable warriors.

26:35.637 --> 26:36.769
Yes, sir.

26:39.293 --> 26:42.035
You know we don'’t have to
be so formal, John, in here.

26:47.649 --> 26:51.174
But whatever
makes you comfortable.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.785
Yes, sir.

26:56.179 --> 26:58.225
I apologize for not knowing
who you were yesterday.

26:59.530 --> 27:01.532
Looked up your record.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.012
You were in the field before.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.624
Before I joined ONI
and hid behind this desk.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.103
-No, sir, that'’s...
-It'’s all right.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.975
-...not what I meant.
-I'’m joking, John.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.805
But yes, I have seen combat.

27:12.848 --> 27:15.808
That'’s good. For us.

27:15.851 --> 27:19.376
To have someone in charge
who'’s been there.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.552
Who understands
what it'’s like.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.560
I know this enemy, sir.

27:29.604 --> 27:33.216
Everything they do
has meaning, intention.

27:33.260 --> 27:36.176
The Covenant attacked
the comms relay on Sanctuary.

27:36.219 --> 27:38.091
Then they glassed the planet.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.267
Clearly, the relay
wasn'’t the objective.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.269
What do you think
they were after?

27:42.312 --> 27:45.489
The experience
of taking it, sir.

27:45.533 --> 27:46.708
I think they were training.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.014
Training?

27:49.755 --> 27:50.799
For what?

27:52.714 --> 27:56.022
I don'’t know.
Whatever comes next.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.677
Something bigger, maybe.

28:01.984 --> 28:04.204
Do you mind if I
ask you some questions?

28:04.247 --> 28:05.858
Please.

28:05.901 --> 28:08.730
Have you ever experienced
hallucinations?

28:08.774 --> 28:10.471
-What?
-Sleeplessness? Confusion.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.038
The sensation of lost time.

28:12.081 --> 28:13.648
I thought we were
talking about Sanctuary.

28:13.692 --> 28:19.132
-We are.
-No, listen to me.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.701
We need to find out
what they were doing

28:22.744 --> 28:24.398
so that we can make--

28:24.441 --> 28:26.922
I need to know what
you were doing, John.

28:29.055 --> 28:32.362
Six months ago,
Dr. Halsey was implicated

28:32.406 --> 28:34.451
in a number of crimes.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.976
The ONI has since become aware

28:37.019 --> 28:43.417
of certain unauthorized
procedures and projects,

28:43.460 --> 28:45.985
including the creation
of an illegal AI.

28:46.028 --> 28:49.205
-What is this?
-Which was implanted

28:49.249 --> 28:52.992
into the UNSC'’s most important
strategic asset, John.

28:53.035 --> 28:55.081
-You.
-Yeah.

28:55.124 --> 28:59.346
Well, they took her out.

28:59.389 --> 29:02.349
It. So...
you don'’t need to worry.

29:02.392 --> 29:03.829
That'’s my job, to worry...

29:05.482 --> 29:09.573
about your readiness,
your reliability.

29:09.617 --> 29:12.011
Is there some question
about my reliability, sir?

29:12.054 --> 29:14.361
-No, not at all.
-Then I think we'’re done.

29:14.404 --> 29:17.973
Sit down, please.

29:18.017 --> 29:20.584
[tense music]

29:27.766 --> 29:31.030
Look, I want you to know
you can talk to me, John.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.555
Everyone knows the Master Chief.

29:34.598 --> 29:38.037
I suppose-- I wonder

29:38.080 --> 29:39.908
if anyone really knows John.

29:42.519 --> 29:44.217
May I go now?

29:45.392 --> 29:46.959
No.

29:51.702 --> 29:53.879
[Soren]
They never stole a ship.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.924
Never looked down
the barrel of a gun.

29:55.968 --> 29:58.971
[Carina] You can teach
them to be pirates.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.103
[Soren] I don'’t need more
dead weight. I need leaders.

30:01.147 --> 30:03.584
[woman]
You have Antares.

30:03.627 --> 30:06.326
[Soren] Don'’t remind me.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.589
[Laera] Oh, there you are.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.112
Where have you been all day?

30:17.772 --> 30:19.208
What'’s with him lately?

30:21.776 --> 30:24.518
I saw a family
at the gate today.

30:24.561 --> 30:26.781
From Madrigal, I think.

30:26.825 --> 30:32.308
Little boy, same age
as Kessler, same eyes.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.137
And I thought, that'’s us,
but for a little luck.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.882
They were us, Soren,

30:40.926 --> 30:42.971
and there was nothing
I could do.

30:43.015 --> 30:45.017
You know I'’d never
let that happen.

30:45.060 --> 30:48.063
Mm, you can'’t
control everything.

30:48.107 --> 30:52.546
Planets turn to embers,
people turned away,

30:52.589 --> 30:57.377
indentured, lost.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.292
[Soren] I can'’t worry
about an entire galaxy.

30:59.335 --> 31:02.948
How can you not?
Everything'’s on fire.

31:04.601 --> 31:06.777
Are you listening to yourself?

31:06.821 --> 31:08.301
You sound ridiculous.

31:09.519 --> 31:11.173
Nope. Sorry.

31:11.217 --> 31:13.001
-I'’m ridiculous?
-I didn'’t say that.

31:13.045 --> 31:16.613
Me? I'’m the ridiculous one?

31:16.657 --> 31:18.398
While you sit here
playing Pirate King,

31:18.441 --> 31:20.400
pretending that
everything as it was,

31:20.443 --> 31:22.402
fantasizing about being the hero

31:22.445 --> 31:24.795
that brings Catherine Halsey
to justice.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.667
I don'’t fantasize
about Catherine--

31:26.710 --> 31:29.931
I saw the look in your eyes
when that boy said her name.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.933
You think
I don'’t know that look.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.892
It'’s the same look
you get every time

31:33.935 --> 31:36.024
some poor, desperate fool
comes in here

31:36.068 --> 31:38.070
claiming to have seen her.

31:38.113 --> 31:41.247
-One time!
-Four times in six months.

31:41.290 --> 31:44.685
And everyone knows it'’s
all ghost stories and rumors.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.208
-[Soren growls]
-Except for you.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.862
I'’m ridiculous.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.999
[Laera] One of us needs
to see the world as it is.

31:55.435 --> 31:57.219
-I see it.
-Do you?

31:59.308 --> 32:00.962
Because you need to be
kinder to your crew.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.487
I'’ll handle my crew.

32:04.531 --> 32:06.837
[Laera] You brought that
treasure back from Madrigal.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.970
You didn'’t share it with them.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.408
They didn'’t do any of the work.

32:12.452 --> 32:15.150
There was nothing to share.
It wasn'’t that much.

32:15.194 --> 32:17.718
But they don'’t know that.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.241
They talk to
the other syndicates.

32:19.285 --> 32:21.069
Good. Let '’em go.

32:22.331 --> 32:23.898
We'’re slipping.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.900
I don'’t know how it happened.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.773
But the other families,
they'’re not afraid...

32:33.299 --> 32:34.213
of you.

32:40.262 --> 32:43.483
You want me to remind them?

32:43.526 --> 32:46.268
-I wanna go away.
-Where?

32:46.312 --> 32:47.356
Anywhere.

32:49.141 --> 32:51.317
Maybe we just go.
You, me, Kess.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.797
-Just get on that ship and--
-And what?

32:56.278 --> 32:57.888
Run?

33:04.243 --> 33:05.287
We don'’t run.

33:15.341 --> 33:16.429
We don'’t run.

33:20.346 --> 33:21.564
[Kai] Hey, Chief.

33:24.089 --> 33:25.307
Come look at this.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.271
[Keyes] Linguistics
specialist Perez

33:32.314 --> 33:34.795
assisted Spartan'’s Silver
team in maintaining

33:34.838 --> 33:37.450
a defensive perimeter

33:37.493 --> 33:40.453
until all civilians
were safely evacuated.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.455
[Vannak] Someone should
tell that to the civilians.

33:42.498 --> 33:45.284
[Keyes] Because of
the bravery and initiative

33:45.327 --> 33:49.027
she exhibited on behalf
of her fellow Marines,

33:49.070 --> 33:52.421
Corporal Perez led
the evacuation of civilians

33:52.465 --> 33:54.423
while returning fire,

33:54.467 --> 33:57.992
inflicting significant
losses on the enemy.

33:58.036 --> 34:02.257
This Colonial Cross
is presented

34:02.301 --> 34:05.260
to Corporal Talia Perez.

34:06.696 --> 34:09.830
[spectators applaud]

34:15.400 --> 34:17.185
[audience applauds]

34:17.228 --> 34:19.492
[Stephanie]
Where is the Master Chief?

34:19.534 --> 34:22.668
Hello, Stephanie.
Great to see you again.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.933
Master Chief and Silver Team
can'’t be here today.

34:28.414 --> 34:31.156
They'’re out there
fighting for you.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.809
[Vannak] Turn it off.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.027
I had enough of
this guy in my debrief.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.378
We are dictating tempo.

34:36.422 --> 34:38.206
What questions did he ask you?

34:39.641 --> 34:41.905
Hey, answer me this.

34:41.949 --> 34:44.038
How come every time we evac
some Outer Colony shithole,

34:44.081 --> 34:45.822
it'’s all in a day's work,

34:45.866 --> 34:47.694
but when you guys do it,
you'’re war heroes?

34:47.737 --> 34:49.565
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.045
I heard they brought home
a bunch of empty coffins.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.091
Yeah. Put you in one, bitch!

34:53.134 --> 34:54.657
[VAL-015] You need to keep
the people in line, Chief.

34:54.701 --> 34:56.355
This is why you don'’t go
taking your pellet out.

34:56.398 --> 34:57.834
Makes you emotional.

34:57.878 --> 34:59.227
Leads to bad decisions.

34:59.271 --> 35:02.448
-Shut your mouth.
-Or what?

35:02.491 --> 35:05.451
Halsey'’s gone.
She can'’t help you.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.017
Silver Team isn'’t
Mommy'’s favorite anymore.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.237
Say what you want about Halsey.

35:09.281 --> 35:11.065
At least she kept us
in the fight.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.763
This new guy, he'’s got us
escorting a tech team

35:13.807 --> 35:15.417
on some fix-it mission.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.376
-You believe that?
-What'’s he got you fixing?

35:17.419 --> 35:19.204
I don'’t know.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.336
Comms relay went down
in some nowhere system.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.773
No combat. It'’s bullshit.

35:23.817 --> 35:26.124
So, why send Cobalt team?

35:26.167 --> 35:28.213
Well, I think it came
down to looks, didn'’t it?

35:28.256 --> 35:29.823
That is affirmative.

35:29.866 --> 35:32.304
They insisted on
the most attractive team.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.262
So, sorry, Riz.

35:34.306 --> 35:37.396
-Suck big ass, Karim.
-Nice.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.267
Is Vannak still
writing your material?

35:39.311 --> 35:42.270
Boy, I'’m about
to wear you like a sock.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.968
Stop picking on Silver.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.275
They have feelings now.

35:47.319 --> 35:48.189
Let'’s move.

35:49.712 --> 35:50.626
Hey, Val.

35:53.542 --> 35:55.414
Just treat it like it'’s real.

35:55.457 --> 35:57.067
Always, Chief.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.550
[Kai] If I ask nicely,
do you think they'’ll let me

36:01.594 --> 36:03.161
shoot those guys?

36:03.204 --> 36:05.467
[Ackerson]
...the battle space.

36:05.511 --> 36:09.079
There will be losses,
but we are winning,

36:09.123 --> 36:12.605
and we will continue to win

36:12.648 --> 36:15.216
because we have something
the enemy does not.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.958
We have heroes.

36:18.001 --> 36:21.831
[crowd cheers and applauds]

36:23.529 --> 36:24.834
[Kai] Chief, you all right?

36:24.878 --> 36:27.446
[tense music]

36:31.537 --> 36:33.147
I get that you have
to lie to the public.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.410
That'’s what you people do.

36:35.454 --> 36:36.977
But if you'’re sending Cobalt
to another comms relay,

36:37.020 --> 36:38.587
you better tell '’em
to expect the Covenant.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.110
Excuse me.

36:40.154 --> 36:42.722
I told you
what hit us on Sanctuary.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.593
Nobody out there
knows anything,

36:44.637 --> 36:46.508
and no one in here
seems to give a shit!

36:46.552 --> 36:48.249
Keep your voice down.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.816
You'’re a non-
commissioned officer.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.165
Just because you
don'’t see a response

36:51.209 --> 36:52.949
doesn'’t mean it's not happening.

36:52.993 --> 36:55.343
-Just listen to me, please.
-I did listen to you, John.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.911
I read your report.
It'’s all there.

36:57.954 --> 36:59.391
Let'’s review, shall we?

36:59.434 --> 37:01.044
You pursued the captive Marines

37:01.088 --> 37:02.045
and were surrounded
by a significant

37:02.089 --> 37:03.395
force of at least 30.

37:03.438 --> 37:04.700
-Yes.
-Sangheili.

37:04.744 --> 37:06.441
-That'’s right.
-Yes.

37:06.485 --> 37:07.790
Apparently under the
command of an elite who--

37:07.834 --> 37:09.357
how did you know
he was the leader?

37:09.401 --> 37:11.185
I know a leader
when I see one, sir.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.361
Yeah, right.
Of course you do.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.364
Yeah. Well...
it all makes sense to me.

37:16.408 --> 37:21.326
I guess my only question
is how are you alive?

37:22.805 --> 37:24.154
Did you defeat them all?

37:26.635 --> 37:28.550
Did they defeat themselves?

37:30.422 --> 37:34.164
[scoffs] They disappeared.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.124
I see.

37:37.167 --> 37:39.648
You know, John,

37:39.692 --> 37:41.650
I never approved
of Halsey'’s methods.

37:41.694 --> 37:42.956
-No.
-What she did to you all

37:42.999 --> 37:44.349
was unconscionable.

37:44.392 --> 37:45.959
-The Cortana system--
-No, no.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.701
-Was never intended to be--
-No, sir.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.617
It'’s no wonder
you'’re experiencing some...

37:51.660 --> 37:52.618
-I'’m not experiencing...
-...irrational...

37:52.661 --> 37:54.010
...any residual side effects.

37:54.054 --> 37:55.664
-No, sir.
-Memory.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.492
-Negative, sir.
-Emotional dysregulation,

37:57.536 --> 37:59.538
John, and until you are
willing to be honest

37:59.581 --> 38:01.714
and forthcoming with me
about your condition--

38:01.757 --> 38:04.238
-What condition?
-I cannot authorize Silver Team

38:04.282 --> 38:06.066
to perform combat operations.

38:08.634 --> 38:09.809
No, sir.

38:09.852 --> 38:12.290
Take your hand off me.

38:13.856 --> 38:14.422
Don'’t do it.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.339
Silver Team'’s
the best weapon you got.

38:27.479 --> 38:29.350
Just tell '’em what
they'’re walking into.

38:31.004 --> 38:32.527
Tell Cobalt.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.443
That is all.

38:41.275 --> 38:44.496
-[Kessler] Where are you going?
-[Soren] To work.

38:44.539 --> 38:47.020
[Kessler] You said you don'’t
have to do that anymore.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.500
-I never said that.
-You did.

38:48.543 --> 38:49.849
Yeah. Well...

38:51.285 --> 38:53.592
sometimes I still gotta go.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.855
[Kessler] Why?

38:55.898 --> 38:59.032
'’Cause I'm the boss.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.687
And every now and then
the boss has to remind people

39:01.730 --> 39:03.645
that he can do
all their jobs too.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.605
Or they won'’t let you boss them.

39:06.648 --> 39:07.823
That'’s exactly right.

39:09.172 --> 39:10.652
Get that thing off your head.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.657
This look tight to you?

39:19.313 --> 39:21.576
-Are you scared?
-Am I scared?

39:23.361 --> 39:25.450
Do you know who
your dad is, huh?

39:25.493 --> 39:26.886
Do you know who your dad is?

39:26.929 --> 39:28.583
-Yeah.
-And what do people say

39:28.627 --> 39:29.932
about your dad?

39:29.976 --> 39:31.369
He'’s a bad man.

39:31.412 --> 39:34.023
He'’s a very bad man.

39:36.069 --> 39:38.376
Look at us.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.073
Just two handsome devils

39:40.116 --> 39:41.901
who ain'’t scared
of nothing and nobody.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.774
What about the monster?

39:51.432 --> 39:53.347
What did we say about that?

39:53.391 --> 39:55.436
-I'’m too old.
-You'’re too old

39:55.480 --> 39:58.265
and too big to be scared of
nonsense and make-believe.

39:58.308 --> 39:59.309
Right?

40:01.268 --> 40:03.401
I know what you want me to say.

40:03.444 --> 40:07.883
Say it. There'’s no such thing
as monsters.

40:07.927 --> 40:11.191
-Why not?
-'’Cause it's a lie.

40:12.888 --> 40:14.368
Where are you getting this from?

40:14.412 --> 40:16.283
Somebody put this in your head?

40:16.326 --> 40:17.545
No, it'’s just there.

40:24.509 --> 40:28.556
Okay. Last time.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.863
There'’s no such
thing as monsters.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.734
No creatures
who come in the night

40:32.778 --> 40:37.435
to snatch little boys away
and steal their souls.

40:37.478 --> 40:39.785
-Do you swear?
-Yes.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.482
[Kessler] Do you
swear on my life?

40:46.792 --> 40:48.837
It'’s time
for you to go to bed.

40:48.881 --> 40:51.057
[faint ominous music]

40:51.100 --> 40:53.363
[gun clicking]

40:59.761 --> 41:03.548
Swear it. There'’s
no such thing as monsters.

41:03.591 --> 41:04.766
I already told you.

41:07.421 --> 41:08.857
You'’re too old for this.

41:15.429 --> 41:20.565
-[ominous thudding]
-[men yelling]

41:29.051 --> 41:31.663
She'’s looking good, Antares.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.496
[Carina]
What'’s got into him?

41:53.511 --> 41:57.123
-You comfortable?
-Yes, sir. Very.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.646
Good.

41:58.690 --> 41:59.821
Now I'’m gonna give
you one chance

41:59.865 --> 42:01.823
to get your story straight.

42:01.867 --> 42:04.130
Don'’t have me flying
all the way out there

42:04.173 --> 42:07.437
and then suddenly
your memory gets fuzzy.

42:07.481 --> 42:10.223
-What'’s your name again?
-Felix.

42:10.266 --> 42:13.661
See, Felix, just '’cause
we take you out there...

42:15.533 --> 42:17.709
doesn'’t mean we bring you back.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.233
You understand?

42:23.497 --> 42:25.499
I know where she is.

42:30.286 --> 42:32.811
[tense music]

42:45.171 --> 42:47.695
[door clanks, slides open]

42:49.044 --> 42:53.048
[lively chatter]

43:02.231 --> 43:06.714
-You need to press the--
-You need to be more careful.

43:06.758 --> 43:08.063
Admiral!

43:08.107 --> 43:10.109
Not anymore.

43:10.152 --> 43:15.157
I'’m just a private citizen now,
a regular Joe.

43:15.201 --> 43:17.203
Someone had to take
the fall for Halsey.

43:17.246 --> 43:18.857
My number was up.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.511
But you know I have
a habit of lingering,

43:21.555 --> 43:23.557
especially where
I'’m not wanted.

43:26.865 --> 43:29.563
What are you going
to tell me about Sanctuary?

43:29.607 --> 43:32.653
They glassed it.
Just like everywhere else.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.612
You'’ll have to do
better than that.

43:38.877 --> 43:40.618
What did you see?

43:40.661 --> 43:44.317
I'’m afraid that's
classified, ma'’am.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.059
You should know there are
elements within the UNSC

43:47.102 --> 43:51.019
that don'’t take these events
as seriously as you and I do.

43:51.063 --> 43:52.934
Ackerson, for one.

43:54.544 --> 43:57.678
What do you know about Ackerson?

43:57.722 --> 44:00.855
I know you'’ll find him
unresponsive to your theories.

44:00.899 --> 44:05.251
He'’s ambitious, he's not
interested in controversy.

44:05.294 --> 44:08.907
Frankly, no one wants to
believe this war is changing.

44:11.953 --> 44:13.825
I want you to pursue evidence

44:13.868 --> 44:15.130
of the Covenant'’s
other activities,

44:15.174 --> 44:18.133
and when you find it,
bring it to me.

44:20.614 --> 44:21.920
Here.

44:24.749 --> 44:27.229
Press the button,
and I'’ll find you.

44:32.278 --> 44:33.801
What will you do for me?

44:36.412 --> 44:38.023
I'’ll believe you.

44:41.330 --> 44:42.114
[dramatic music]

44:44.377 --> 44:45.987
[dramatic music]

44:46.031 --> 44:48.990
[Felix] So, I turn up
for this salvage job.

44:49.034 --> 44:52.777
Well, the crew,
these aren'’t farmers.

44:52.820 --> 44:55.693
I'’m talking
very scary individuals.

44:55.736 --> 44:58.521
Like... bounty hunters.

44:58.565 --> 44:59.871
-Not bounty hunters.
-No, I'’m serious.

44:59.914 --> 45:03.178
Would you just let
him tell it, Carina?

45:03.222 --> 45:05.354
So, I'’m running
the flat-loader,

45:05.398 --> 45:08.444
and they'’ve got
this big crate,

45:08.488 --> 45:11.665
and I lower it onto the deck
and the side panel falls off.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.233
They didn'’t think
I saw, but I did.

45:14.276 --> 45:16.061
A cryo-tube.

45:16.104 --> 45:17.758
And there'’s this woman in it,

45:17.802 --> 45:19.891
and I'’m thinking,
I know that face.

45:21.980 --> 45:23.895
Her picture was all over
the place, remember?

45:25.897 --> 45:28.073
Catherine Halsey.

45:28.116 --> 45:29.291
I knew.

45:31.424 --> 45:33.731
and the
ship went missing.

45:33.774 --> 45:36.908
And I was the only one who
knew the course they'’d plotted.

45:36.951 --> 45:38.736
Right through...

45:38.779 --> 45:41.303
-[alarm beeping]
-Oh, shit.

45:46.308 --> 45:49.007
-Get us onto that airlock.
-Aye, Captain.

45:53.011 --> 45:54.969
I'’m gonna need to suit up.

45:55.013 --> 45:57.711
That ship looks
ready to break apart.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.408
You should be careful.

46:00.627 --> 46:01.933
You should be careful.

46:03.935 --> 46:05.371
You'’re coming with me.

46:06.546 --> 46:09.114
[tense music]

46:42.712 --> 46:47.674
We could split it,
the bounty, maybe 60/40.

46:50.068 --> 46:52.635
You'’re right. Dumb idea.

46:55.464 --> 46:56.988
Cargo hold'’s down there.

47:03.516 --> 47:05.300
They said you used
to be a Spartan.

47:07.433 --> 47:09.914
[Soren] Long time ago.

47:09.957 --> 47:13.004
[Felix] So, you knew
her, then? Halsey.

47:14.440 --> 47:16.746
They say she'’s a genius,

47:16.790 --> 47:18.966
but a little
on the evil side, right?

47:22.796 --> 47:24.667
Whoa.

47:24.711 --> 47:26.626
What do I do?

47:26.669 --> 47:28.019
Don'’t touch anything.

47:31.326 --> 47:34.025
[feet thudding]

47:39.291 --> 47:41.293
[Felix] She took
little kids, right?

47:46.776 --> 47:49.954
[ominous thudding]

47:59.224 --> 48:01.052
It'’s not about
the money for you, is it?

48:04.142 --> 48:08.146
It'’s about what
she did to ya, that arm.

48:12.019 --> 48:13.673
I said the wrong
thing, didn'’t I?

48:13.716 --> 48:17.764
[Soren] Yep, you did.

48:25.511 --> 48:27.165
[massive whooshing sound]

48:27.208 --> 48:28.818
[Felix] Oh, shit!

48:28.862 --> 48:32.213
[Felix gasping]

48:32.257 --> 48:33.736
Let'’s go back.

48:39.090 --> 48:40.700
Calm down.

48:43.746 --> 48:46.097
There she is, told ya.

48:47.185 --> 48:49.665
[feet thudding]

48:57.891 --> 48:59.284
[Felix exclaims]

49:06.508 --> 49:08.206
Sorry!

49:27.877 --> 49:30.532
-Which panel?
-What?

49:30.576 --> 49:32.317
You said one of
the panels fell off.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.188
Which one?

49:34.232 --> 49:36.930
Right.
Um... on the side there.

49:36.974 --> 49:39.977
You were on the flat-loader
and you saw her.

49:40.020 --> 49:41.935
How?

49:41.979 --> 49:43.328
Right.

49:43.371 --> 49:44.851
Um...

49:44.894 --> 49:48.115
No, I got down first to look.

49:48.159 --> 49:52.076
Who are you?
Who are you working for?

49:54.382 --> 49:56.558
[thunderous hum]

49:56.602 --> 49:59.387
Antares!
What the hell are you doing?

50:00.519 --> 50:02.956
[loud banging]

50:03.000 --> 50:05.176
[Felix] I don'’t think
they'’re coming back.

50:08.440 --> 50:09.702
Shit.

50:12.966 --> 50:16.187
[footsteps approaching]

50:18.841 --> 50:20.626
Who'’s first?

50:20.669 --> 50:23.629
[Felix] Soren-066,
you'’re under arrest...

50:23.672 --> 50:26.414
[men grunting]

50:29.200 --> 50:32.855
...for the crimes of piracy,
kidnapping, extortion,

50:32.899 --> 50:34.161
and treason.

50:43.692 --> 50:47.131
[distant upbeat music]

51:19.772 --> 51:22.253
[woman] Hi there, sailor.
What are you looking for?

51:25.125 --> 51:26.344
First time?

51:29.303 --> 51:31.088
Welcome back, customer.

51:31.131 --> 51:33.133
Setting your visual paramiters.

51:41.359 --> 51:44.318
I don'’t really know
what people say to each other.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.324
I think there might be
something wrong with me.

51:52.587 --> 51:56.548
Like there'’s a part
of me that'’s missing...

52:00.117 --> 52:03.381
or sometimes
there'’s a sound...

52:03.424 --> 52:06.253
like something in my head
that doesn'’t belong.

52:06.297 --> 52:11.128
And I think maybe
it'’s a part of you...

52:11.171 --> 52:15.044
that got embedded
somehow in me.

52:15.088 --> 52:17.395
Oh, sweetie.

52:17.438 --> 52:19.310
You miss her, don'’t you?

52:21.834 --> 52:25.446
-You don'’t have to do that.
-Do what?

52:25.490 --> 52:28.928
-Talk.
-But I want to be her for you.

52:28.971 --> 52:31.713
Yeah. Well, you can'’t.

52:31.757 --> 52:33.367
Is it my nose?

52:34.847 --> 52:36.283
-No.
-Are you sure?

52:36.327 --> 52:38.764
-Your nose is fine.
-You can change it.

52:38.807 --> 52:40.722
I know I could
change it. I don'’t...

52:40.766 --> 52:42.333
[clears throat]

52:42.376 --> 52:43.551
I don'’t wanna change it.

52:49.209 --> 52:51.342
Well, maybe you don'’t
really want her at all.

52:52.952 --> 52:54.301
Don'’t you even know what you--

52:54.345 --> 52:58.740
[eerie interference]

52:58.784 --> 53:00.046
You should'’ve stayed with me.

53:00.089 --> 53:01.700
Sweetie?

53:01.743 --> 53:04.181
[John gasps]

53:07.445 --> 53:11.057
Oh, darn. Looks
like our time'’s up.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.190
To add more time,
please swipe.

53:17.716 --> 53:19.370
Hi there, Sarah,
what do you--

53:21.807 --> 53:24.244
[pensive music]

53:26.594 --> 53:28.422
[Makee] You should'’ve
stayed with me.

53:36.300 --> 53:39.520
[woman vocalizes]

53:39.564 --> 53:42.219
[Storyteller]
It'’s very old, the monster.

53:45.222 --> 53:49.878
Older than the light,
older than this rock...

53:52.011 --> 53:53.447
older than your god.

54:02.021 --> 54:03.370
It knows us...

54:06.199 --> 54:08.201
inside and out.

54:13.467 --> 54:15.426
Smells our fear.

54:15.469 --> 54:18.298
[dramatic music]

54:21.345 --> 54:23.303
Sees our secrets.

54:25.784 --> 54:26.741
It'’s been here...

54:30.092 --> 54:31.877
all that time.

54:36.534 --> 54:38.275
Waiting.

54:40.842 --> 54:42.322
To meet you...

54:44.846 --> 54:46.370
in the dark.

54:57.424 --> 54:59.557
There'’s nothing
you can give it.

55:02.516 --> 55:05.127
[Kwan] The only thing
the monster wants

55:05.171 --> 55:06.520
is for you to know...

55:10.655 --> 55:12.439
that there'’s nothing
you can ever love

55:12.483 --> 55:14.833
that it can'’t take away.

55:14.876 --> 55:17.488
[pensive music]

55:20.404 --> 55:22.493
You believe me now,
don'’t you?

55:34.505 --> 55:36.550
[dramatic music swells]

55:42.295 --> 55:46.295
[closing theme music plays]
