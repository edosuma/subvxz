You really know me, internet.

00:32.572 --> 00:34.907
- Hey, guys!
- Yeah, Steven?

00:34.941 --> 00:37.609
You guys should take
this online quiz I found.

00:37.644 --> 00:39.878
It tells you what...

00:39.913 --> 00:41.713
It tells you what character you are

00:41.781 --> 00:44.750
- from "Crying Breakfast Friends"!
- Eh... why?

00:44.784 --> 00:47.820
It's just fun to see yourself
as a cartoon character.

00:47.854 --> 00:50.656
Like weeping eggcup,
who's neurotic and uptight,

00:50.723 --> 00:52.925
<i>or pining grapefruit,
the sensitive older one</i>

00:52.959 --> 00:54.927
<i>who wishes he was a better role model.</i>

00:54.961 --> 00:58.964
Uh, maybe we can do that thing
after we've fixed the van.

00:58.998 --> 01:03.168
Okay.
I'll go find someone else!

01:03.203 --> 01:05.404
Do you understand that cartoon show?

01:05.471 --> 01:07.573
I don't understand anything anymore.

01:09.409 --> 01:12.211
Hey, Steven. Is there
any more engine oil?

01:12.245 --> 01:13.712
I need it for this sandwich.

01:13.746 --> 01:17.816
- I...think that's for cars.
- Well, is there any more of it?

01:17.884 --> 01:19.685
Dad's probably got some outside.

01:19.719 --> 01:22.688
Oh! But, uh, you got to
take this online quiz.

01:22.722 --> 01:27.593
- Which Crying Breakfast Friend are you?
- That show's really weird.

01:27.627 --> 01:29.962
Who wants to watch
a cartoon about people crying?

01:29.996 --> 01:32.564
- I do!
- Okay, okay!

01:32.632 --> 01:35.267
Uh... what's the first question?

01:35.301 --> 01:39.471
- Do you ever act without thinking?
- Nope. Never.

01:39.505 --> 01:42.708
Are you afraid of taking
risks and trying new things?

01:44.043 --> 01:46.545
<i>Terrified.</i>

01:46.579 --> 01:49.648
Amethyst, are you taking this seriously?

01:49.682 --> 01:52.384
- Of course I am.
- Okay.

01:53.853 --> 01:56.355
<i>Are you insecure about
your relationships</i>

01:56.389 --> 01:58.724
<i>and how you're perceived
by other people?</i>

01:58.758 --> 02:01.295
N-N-No...
Yes? Eh...

02:01.329 --> 02:04.031
- What's the right answer?
- There is no right answer.

02:04.065 --> 02:06.133
You're just supposed to answer honestly.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.568
- Nah, I'm bored.
- Wait ... I have loads more

02:08.603 --> 02:11.758
probing, personal questions to ask!

02:12.240 --> 02:15.309
Garnet! W-What are
you doing in my room?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.177
I saw a corrupted gem.

02:17.212 --> 02:19.647
I followed it through the
tunnel it dug in the rock.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.583
- Yeah, right.
- Where did it come from?

02:22.617 --> 02:24.418
It's similar to Pearl's description

02:24.452 --> 02:26.987
of the creature she saw
slinking through the temple.

02:27.022 --> 02:31.358
- You saw the Slinker?!
- I thought we agreed there was no Slinker

02:31.393 --> 02:34.261
and that we weren't going
to call it "the Slinker".

02:34.296 --> 02:35.663
Yes, we did.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.932
But now it's undeniable
the creature exists

02:37.966 --> 02:40.534
- and that Steven's name stuck.
- Yes!

02:40.602 --> 02:44.271
No! Look, why don't you
just let me look for it?

02:44.306 --> 02:46.907
Because you won't.

02:50.345 --> 02:53.581
- How long's this thing been in here?
- Ah!

02:53.615 --> 02:55.616
Look, Steven!
I'm a pachyderm!

02:55.650 --> 02:59.186
Oh! 
And there's a prize inside!

02:59.220 --> 03:01.388
<i>Shhh! Keep quiet.</i>

03:06.595 --> 03:09.463
Oh, Garnet.
Stern but practical.

03:09.497 --> 03:11.265
Just like spilt milk.

03:11.299 --> 03:13.634
You're not still on about
that dumb cartoon, are you?

03:13.668 --> 03:15.436
Oh, right ... the quiz!

03:15.470 --> 03:18.572
Do you get defensive when
people ask you questions

03:18.607 --> 03:21.508
about the feelings you
prefer to keep hidden?

03:21.543 --> 03:25.713
Don't get all
psycho-logical on me, Steven.

03:26.548 --> 03:28.382
Uh... sorry?

03:42.631 --> 03:44.598
No.

03:47.235 --> 03:49.036
<i>Aw, man!</i>

03:49.070 --> 03:51.372
<i>I think my favorite
round thing was in there.</i>

03:51.406 --> 03:53.707
I'll get you a new round thing.

03:53.742 --> 03:56.677
Ugh! This is my stuff
you're messing with!

03:56.711 --> 03:59.046
<i>If it's gonna get ... Ugh!
... wrecked,</i>

03:59.080 --> 04:01.382
<i>I'm gonna be the one to wreck it!</i>

04:03.118 --> 04:05.953
See?!
That's how it's do...

04:14.195 --> 04:17.064
Amethyst got poofed!

04:17.098 --> 04:18.464
Slinker!

04:24.372 --> 04:27.141
G-G-G-Garnet?

04:27.175 --> 04:31.645
Steven, remember ... our
bodies are only an illusion.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.313
Amethyst will be fine.

04:33.348 --> 04:36.550
B-B-But Pearl took two
whole weeks to come back.

04:36.584 --> 04:39.520
And I already miss Amethyst so much!

04:39.554 --> 04:42.656
Don't worry. She'll be
back before you know it.

04:47.362 --> 04:49.163
Literally.

04:53.702 --> 04:56.036
Amethyst's back!
Amethyst's back!

04:56.071 --> 04:59.769
- Ugh. Huh?
- Looks like you...

04:59.866 --> 05:02.443
grew a few feet since
the last time I saw you!

05:02.477 --> 05:03.610
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!

05:03.678 --> 05:06.647
That was fast.
Even for you.

05:07.716 --> 05:09.516
Eh! It's no big deal.

05:09.551 --> 05:12.486
I didn't want to keep my
biggest fan waiting.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.520
Ugh!

05:14.823 --> 05:16.023
Hmm.

05:16.091 --> 05:19.226
Okay, okay!
We got a Slinker to slink!

05:20.361 --> 05:22.129
Wa-ugh!

05:22.463 --> 05:23.764
Hmm.

05:23.798 --> 05:27.634
Where would I go
if I was a monster?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.672
Hey! Over here.

05:31.740 --> 05:35.609
- Your new form is really interesting.
- Thanks, Steven.

05:35.643 --> 05:38.078
I didn't even know you could
come back this different.

05:38.146 --> 05:41.648
- Thanks, Steven.
- So, why'd you come back with four legs?

05:41.683 --> 05:46.086
- 'Cause I like walking!
- Wow. I want four legs, too!

05:46.154 --> 05:49.656
No, you don't.
Amethyst rushed her regeneration.

05:49.691 --> 05:52.726
<i>- She should have taken her time.
- Like Pearl?</i>

05:52.761 --> 05:57.364
Yes. Pearl put a bit more...
thought into how she came back.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.333
<i>Pearl, Pearl, Pearl!</i>

05:59.367 --> 06:00.834
You know I can hear you!

06:00.869 --> 06:03.504
I'm sorry I'm not like
Pearl with her fancy form

06:03.538 --> 06:06.895
and her clean room
with no monsters in it.

06:08.877 --> 06:11.059
<i>Amethyst?</i>

06:11.513 --> 06:15.215
Amethyst's gem!
She got poofed again!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.251
This is a good opportunity for her.

06:17.318 --> 06:19.839
Now she can make a better form.

06:19.874 --> 06:22.343
She's coming back!

06:24.259 --> 06:27.227
You're right.
This is much better!

06:27.262 --> 06:29.530
She's doing Pearl!

06:33.635 --> 06:36.503
Hey, Garnet. What do you
think of my new look, Garnet?

06:37.772 --> 06:41.241
I'm more like Pearl now.
Isn't it wonderful? Ha!

06:41.276 --> 06:44.378
I feel...
practically perfect!

06:44.412 --> 06:47.281
We need to focus on
listening for the creature.

06:47.315 --> 06:49.783
<i>Oh, but I can't focus.</i>

06:49.818 --> 06:52.519
All these rocks are different sizes.

06:52.554 --> 06:55.789
We'll have to organize
them by shape and color.

06:55.824 --> 06:59.293
Didn't anyone tell nature
how I want it to look?

07:00.328 --> 07:04.164
- Don't encourage her.
- But I need encouragement, Garnet.

07:04.199 --> 07:06.600
I need everyone's constant approval.

07:06.634 --> 07:09.469
I need to loquaciously
converse so I can show off...

07:09.504 --> 07:11.505
how smart I am.

07:11.539 --> 07:14.541
You can converse with me.
Let's finish that quiz.

07:14.576 --> 07:16.944
Do you need to plan
ahead before you act?

07:16.978 --> 07:20.380
- Oh, thoroughly.
- Do you obsess over little details?

07:20.415 --> 07:23.550
- Completely entirely!
- Wow, you're so method.

07:23.585 --> 07:25.419
Next time, can you come back as me?

07:25.486 --> 07:27.621
This is not a good choice for your form.

07:27.689 --> 07:30.591
Lighten up, Garnet.
Can't you take a joke?

07:30.625 --> 07:33.760
It's not funny.
You've made yourself ridiculous.

07:33.795 --> 07:37.814
- Ridiculous?!
- Keep your voice down! The creature.

07:37.849 --> 07:41.835
Grrr! You wanted me to be
more like Pearl, and now I am!

07:41.903 --> 07:44.671
Pearl would have taken
her regeneration seriously!

07:44.706 --> 07:48.175
What do you care?!
My form is my business!

07:48.209 --> 07:51.411
It's my business when it
affects the strength of the team!

07:52.380 --> 07:54.348
So what?!
I'm not strong enough?

07:54.382 --> 07:59.419
- Amethyst!
- Are you saying I'm weak?!

08:00.955 --> 08:03.812
Is it weird I'm getting numb to this?

08:06.427 --> 08:07.961
Unh?

08:07.996 --> 08:09.363
Mnh!

08:14.402 --> 08:15.669
Okay!

08:15.703 --> 08:17.704
You know, I wasn't
feeling this at first,

08:17.739 --> 08:20.607
but I think I might be
coming around! Ha!

08:20.842 --> 08:23.781
Yo, Ste-Man.
My seams straight?

08:24.011 --> 08:26.947
Does that new form... hurt you?

08:28.116 --> 08:31.151
No.
Hey, Garnet.

08:31.185 --> 08:35.155
How'd you like to mix
it up with this?

08:35.188 --> 08:37.924
<i>Just a little somethin'
I threw together. You know.</i>

08:37.958 --> 08:40.494
This form isn't sustainable, Amethyst.

08:40.528 --> 08:44.464
But... you're the one who said
I needed to be stronger!

08:47.468 --> 08:50.504
Okay, if it's my monster,
then I'll deal with it.

08:50.538 --> 08:52.631
Raaaahh!

08:53.808 --> 08:55.909
<i>Amethyst!</i>

09:01.115 --> 09:02.549
Stay behind me!

09:03.885 --> 09:05.051
Amethyst!

09:05.086 --> 09:06.186
Hah!

09:08.956 --> 09:10.891
Amethyst!

09:23.838 --> 09:26.106
<i>- Let it go!
- No!</i>

09:26.174 --> 09:28.775
Ugh.
You wanted me to be stronger!

09:28.809 --> 09:31.945
<i>I'm doing it!
I'm being what you want!</i>

09:32.013 --> 09:33.713
I don't want this!

09:34.615 --> 09:35.582
Huh?

09:36.817 --> 09:40.153
Well, what do you want?!
Just tell me, and I'll do that!

09:40.221 --> 09:41.922
I can't tell you, Amethyst!

09:41.956 --> 09:44.157
You have to figure
this out for yourself!

09:45.960 --> 09:49.834
She can't. She doesn't
want to think about herself!

09:50.836 --> 09:51.736
<i>What?</i>

09:59.244 --> 10:00.678
Good catch.

10:04.082 --> 10:06.784
<i>I knew that thing was real!</i>

10:06.819 --> 10:09.320
When Amethyst gets back,
we have to go find it.

10:09.354 --> 10:12.356
- How long has it been?
- Four hours.

10:12.424 --> 10:15.393
Four hours?!
She's never taken so long.

10:15.427 --> 10:17.428
What is she doing in there?

10:17.462 --> 10:20.464
I'm not sure.
I was too hard on her.

10:23.202 --> 10:24.836
Oh, oh!
She's coming back!

10:27.739 --> 10:29.974
All right.
Everyone be supportive.

10:35.714 --> 10:38.783
- What?
- Aw, you barely changed.

10:38.851 --> 10:39.851
Steven!

10:44.456 --> 10:46.190
It's perfect.

10:46.792 --> 10:49.460
Ehh, whatev.
It's just what feels right.

10:49.494 --> 10:53.331
- That's why it's perfect.
- It is a marked improvement.

10:53.365 --> 10:57.001
You finally fixed that shoulder strap
that's always bugged me!

10:57.035 --> 11:00.137
- Welcome back!
- Well done, Amethyst!

11:00.205 --> 11:01.906
Knock it off!
Hunnhh!

11:01.940 --> 11:05.376
- We got to go find the Slinker!
- No, it's hug time!

11:05.410 --> 11:08.517
Ugh! This is so dumb!
