Typical Thomas.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.977
Signs us up
for a tug-of-war tournament

00:21.021 --> 00:22.457
and don't show up for practice.

00:22.500 --> 00:25.068
He's gonna be here soon.
He's just seeing a client.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.505
Yeah, but it is
pretty convenient.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.246
Well, at least
it's for a good cause.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.727
Winner gets ten grand to donate
to the charity of their choice.

00:31.770 --> 00:34.121
And we should donate
our winnings to Jindog.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.600
What do you guys think?

00:35.644 --> 00:39.213
Jin. Look, whilst we support
your dog-walking app,

00:39.256 --> 00:42.216
we've already picked a charity;
it's Hawaii Foodbank.

00:42.259 --> 00:43.739
Well, that's great,
'cause Jindog's proceeds

00:43.782 --> 00:45.567
goes toward
the same cause, so...

00:45.610 --> 00:47.047
So you're telling me you donate

00:47.090 --> 00:49.092
all your profits
to feed the hungry?

00:49.136 --> 00:51.573
No, I keep my profits. I'm
just saying I'm always hungry.

Ah.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.402
This spot should do.

00:54.445 --> 00:55.968
Great.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.927
By the way, it's tug-of-war.
Why do we need to practice?

00:57.970 --> 00:59.581
Because there is
strategy involved.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.843
It's not just about strength.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.280
He's right.
In the Makahiki games,

01:03.324 --> 01:07.980
we call tug-of-war hukihuki,
which means "pull, pull."

01:08.024 --> 01:09.765
That's what we chant when
we're working together.

01:09.808 --> 01:11.201
Let's give it a try.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.724
Oh, wait a minute.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.857
Thomas isn't here.
Can't practice three on three.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.859
Oh, no, no, we'll do, uh,
two strongest

01:16.902 --> 01:18.165

RICK:
No offense, Jin,

01:22.691 --> 01:24.823

the second strongest here.

I have to agree.
Have you seen Juliet's arms?

01:27.522 --> 01:29.741
Well...Have you seen my core?

Thomas just signed us up
yesterday.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.796
Yeah, I ate pancakes

really advertise.

Mm, I can relate.

02:23.317 --> 02:26.842
So, Sato, how can I help you?

02:28.539 --> 02:30.324
Actually, I don't need any help.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.178
Well, the future
is female, right?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.180
But...

03:44.224 --> 03:45.312
why am I here?

03:45.355 --> 03:50.447
My son Kota was
kidnapped last night.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.970
He's my only child,

03:52.014 --> 03:54.799
and will someday take
over the family business.

03:54.843 --> 04:00.327
Obviously, I can't go
to HPD or the FBI,

04:00.370 --> 04:03.982
so I'd like you to find him.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.376
I'm flattered, but, uh,

04:06.420 --> 04:10.337
Mr. Shima,
you have plenty of resources.

04:10.380 --> 04:11.729
Not like you.

04:11.773 --> 04:14.210
Well, that may be
the case, but...

04:14.254 --> 04:18.388
helping a criminal organization
secure its future

04:18.432 --> 04:21.739

So I'm gonna have
to very respectfully decline.

04:29.094 --> 04:32.228
I had a feeling you would.

So I'm going to offer you
something you can't refuse.

I don't help you find your son?

we need to do

08:56.013 --> 08:57.624
whatever we can to help him.

08:57.667 --> 08:58.973
Calling us was dangerous
but smart.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
I can't believe
Magnum pulled it off.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.020
I can't believe we're dealing
a guy like Osi Shima.

09:03.064 --> 09:06.154
Way people talk about him,
he's a myth, or a ghost.

Well, that explains why he went
to Thomas instead of the cops.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.854

poisoned for leverage.

There's no way Thomas would have
taken that case otherwise.

poison Shima used on Magnum,

and we have a time frame.

09:22.431 --> 09:23.867
Okay, that's a good idea.

09:23.911 --> 09:25.869
So I guess that meeting
with the chef

to lure Thomas there.

He's a ghost,
like you said.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.359
who he was
in recent contact with.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.839
We need to go to that sushi bar.

No, no, no, no, this is
the yakuza we're dealing with.

of them than you, no offense.

learn in the 30 seconds

11:00.311 --> 11:01.530
you've been standing there?

11:01.573 --> 11:03.445
A lot, actually.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.882
In the last 30 seconds,
six cars have driven by.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.144
It's not even rush hour.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.016
Means that this street
is pretty busy.So?

11:09.059 --> 11:10.713
So, you should probably have
your tech guy--

11:10.757 --> 11:12.367
I'm-I'm assuming
that's not you--

11:12.410 --> 11:13.803
look into whatever
rideshare cars

11:13.847 --> 11:15.196
drove by this street

11:15.239 --> 11:16.676
around the time Kota was taken.

11:16.719 --> 11:17.938
How will that help?

11:17.981 --> 11:19.591
Well, a lot of these cars
have dashcams.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.724
T-That seems like a long shot
that one of those drove by

11:21.768 --> 11:23.726
at the exact same time
of the kidnapping.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.510
That may be the case, but we
could still learn something

11:25.554 --> 11:27.295
about the scene
around the time he was taken.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.384
TOWER:
Like what?Like if he was being followed

11:29.427 --> 11:32.126
or being staked out
or if he was somehow in

11:32.169 --> 11:33.605
on his own kidnapping.

11:33.649 --> 11:34.868
That's ridiculous.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.260
Maybe, but I mean,

11:36.304 --> 11:37.697
I've seen everything
in my line of work,

11:37.740 --> 11:39.568
and I've learned not
to rule anything out.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.526
[sighs]

11:43.093 --> 11:44.529
We should get going.

11:51.623 --> 11:53.974
[door bells tinkle]

11:54.017 --> 11:56.324
Can I help you?

11:56.367 --> 11:59.501
Hi. Um, my name is Mr. Kim
from the Public Health Board,

11:59.544 --> 12:02.069
and I'm just doing
a random food inspection.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.766
I wasn't aware
that you were coming.

12:03.810 --> 12:06.334
Well, that's why they call it
"a random inspection."

12:06.377 --> 12:08.640
So, I'm in charge,
and hope you don't mind.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.252
Um, unless if there's something
you're hiding?

12:11.295 --> 12:12.470
Hiding? Like what?

12:12.514 --> 12:13.776
Oh, I don't know.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.039
Um, maybe buying cheap tuna

12:16.083 --> 12:18.085
with exposed radiation
from Fukushima.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.217
No, no, no.
No, nothing like that, I swear.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.263
Okay, it's just gonna take
a couple of minutes.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.960
I won't get in your way,
you won't get in mine.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.788
Understood.Okay.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.140
[soft clicking]

12:32.926 --> 12:34.231
Arigato.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.064
HIGGINS:
And we have video.

12:41.108 --> 12:44.198
Way to go, Jin.
Now for the audio.

12:48.593 --> 12:51.509
How's everything?
It's good?

12:55.644 --> 12:59.256
Mr. Kim, how was the inspection?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.823
Very good.
Attention, everyone!

13:00.867 --> 13:05.175
There's no
radioactive tuna here. Eat away!

13:07.003 --> 13:08.265
Bye.

13:09.353 --> 13:11.486
[door bells tinkle]

13:17.057 --> 13:20.321
[door opens]Hi. Would you like to dine in?

13:20.364 --> 13:22.932
No, I'm here looking
for my brother Thomas.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.847
See the resemblance?

13:25.935 --> 13:28.242
Yeah, his phone went dead
when he walked in here.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.200
I don't know what to say.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.549
I haven't seen your friend.

13:31.593 --> 13:35.379
Hmm. See,
something's not adding up here,

13:35.423 --> 13:37.773
so I might have
to call the police on this one.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.514
Yeah, of course.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.821
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.867
Okay.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.306
Cool.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.224
RICK:
And right on cue...

13:54.268 --> 13:55.312
[touch tones sounding]

13:55.356 --> 13:56.444
[line ringing]

13:56.487 --> 13:58.011
Hello. Someone just came in

13:58.054 --> 13:59.447
and asked for Thomas Magnum.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.144
SHIMA:
Were they HPD?

14:01.188 --> 14:02.667
SATO:
No, but he said
he was gonna contact them.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.539
SHIMA:
Stay there. I'll send men over

14:04.582 --> 14:05.975
in case he comes back.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.194
Yes, Mr. Shima.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.586
[phone clicks off]Okay.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.327
Now I should be able
to get Shima's number.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.808
But his phone was out of frame.
We didn't see what he dialed.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.810
No, we didn't see it,
we heard it.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.466
Every touch tone is a distinct
combination of two frequencies.

14:18.509 --> 14:20.598
Isolating the call.

14:21.382 --> 14:24.254
[touch tones sounding]

14:24.298 --> 14:25.603
We have Shima's number.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.215
Okay, I'm in.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.739
Wow. There are a lot of messages
to weed through.

14:30.782 --> 14:32.045
This could take some time.

14:32.088 --> 14:34.612
Try searching, uh,
"toxin," or-or "poison."

14:34.656 --> 14:36.005
Okay.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.747
I found a text thread.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.141
Right. Looks like this is the
guy that supplied the poison.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.577
Did it say what poison it is?

14:42.620 --> 14:45.667
Mm, no, but I can narrow down
his location,

14:45.710 --> 14:47.843
and then,
we can just ask him ourselves.

14:52.326 --> 14:54.284
MAGNUM:
So, how does

14:54.328 --> 14:56.721
a Vietnamese woman
end up being a bodyguard

14:56.765 --> 14:59.463
for the head of the yakuza?

15:02.162 --> 15:04.425
Ah. Right. Sorry.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.994
I'm used to talking things
through with a partner.

15:08.037 --> 15:10.735
Yup, well, I'm not your partner.

15:10.779 --> 15:12.955
No. No, you're not, but...

15:12.999 --> 15:16.045
you might be the last person
I work with.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.924
I spent most
of my twenties in prison.

15:24.967 --> 15:27.491
When I got out, it was
hard to make ends meet.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.973
One night, I was hanging
at an underground card room,

15:31.017 --> 15:32.627
a known gang hot spot.

15:32.670 --> 15:36.109
Shima and his men were there.
Place got raided by HPD.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.981
And there was no way I was
going back to prison, so,

15:39.025 --> 15:41.984
I took down a few cops
to get away.

15:42.028 --> 15:45.988
Turns out by doing that,
Shima was able to escape, too.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.992
Couple days later,
he recruited me.

15:51.211 --> 15:54.823
If you're as good at your job
as Shima says you are,

15:54.866 --> 15:57.434
it means at least two things--
you're smart

15:57.478 --> 15:59.219
and tough.

15:59.262 --> 16:01.699
So much else you could be doing
with your life.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.658
You trying to rehabilitate me?

16:03.701 --> 16:06.008
[vehicle door opens]

16:06.922 --> 16:08.706
We tracked down all
the rideshare cars

16:08.750 --> 16:10.708
that were in the area.

16:10.752 --> 16:12.841
Turns out you were right.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.365
Mm-hmm. It's got
to be tough to admit.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.716
A driver with a dash cam
drove by before the kidnapping.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.414
Recorded a black
Taurus staked out

16:20.457 --> 16:22.459
in front of Kota's apartment.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.026
We tracked it back to Soko.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.985
You're kidding.

16:26.028 --> 16:28.030
It's a warehouse owned
by Jumak. They're a...

16:28.074 --> 16:29.727
Korean gang. Yeah, I know.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.687
Well, what you might not know is
that they used to be our rivals.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.036
But we've had
a long-standing truce.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.864
We're technically still
in a truce,

16:35.907 --> 16:37.779
but after they wrongfully
accused us

16:37.822 --> 16:41.043
of stealing a drug shipment last
month, tensions have been high.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.436
So you think this kidnapping

16:42.479 --> 16:44.177
could have something
to do with the stolen drugs?

16:44.220 --> 16:47.832
If Jumak is behind this, Shima
will end the truce immediately.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.747
And the island's two
biggest gangs would go to war.

16:49.791 --> 16:51.836
Oahu would become
a battleground.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.708
The collateral damage
could be massive.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.015
Guess you just got another
reason to find Shima's kid.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.156
Okay, I got into
the poison supplier's burner,

17:07.200 --> 17:08.984
but he's using a spoofing app,

17:09.028 --> 17:11.073
so zeroing in on his location
is gonna take a minute.

17:11.117 --> 17:13.815
Gordie.
What's the word?

17:13.858 --> 17:14.859
I spoke with Noelani.

17:14.903 --> 17:16.296
Giving her Magnum's symptoms

17:16.339 --> 17:18.254
and timeline only narrowed down
the potential poisons

17:18.298 --> 17:19.299
to about a hundred.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.257
Now even if we had a sample

17:21.301 --> 17:22.563
of his blood, there
wouldn't be enough time

17:22.606 --> 17:24.086
to run it through
a mass spectrometer.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.522
So, what are you saying?

17:25.566 --> 17:26.784
I'm saying our best bet is

17:26.828 --> 17:28.569
to go after
the antidote directly.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.788
"Our"?Look, I know
my hands are usually tied,

17:30.832 --> 17:32.616
but Magnum's life is
on the line.

17:32.660 --> 17:34.270
I'll do whatever it takes
to help.

17:34.314 --> 17:36.229
Thank you, Gordon.

17:36.272 --> 17:37.839
[computer chirps]Okay.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.102
I've got the poison supplier's
location,

17:40.146 --> 17:42.104
but it was only able to narrow
it down to a remote street

17:42.148 --> 17:44.019
in the Waianae foothills.JIN:
Looks like

17:44.063 --> 17:45.629
there's eight houses
on that street.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.588
We can't go busting
into all of 'em.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.069
Hang on. Uh, I have an idea.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.288
I saw something installed
on this guy's phone.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.550
It's an app. Here it is.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.856
It measures kilowatt hours.

17:54.899 --> 17:56.684
Yeah, that's how
solar power is measured.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.947
About one in every three houses
on this rock has solar.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.992
If we see which of those
eight houses has panels,

18:01.036 --> 18:02.690
we could get lucky.

18:02.733 --> 18:04.779
I'll get in the air
and start looking at rooftops.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.476
Jin, you afraid of heights?

18:06.520 --> 18:08.043
No, just spiders. Why?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.480
You're rolling with me.
Four eyes is better than two.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.308
Okay.
Rick and I will drive there,

18:12.352 --> 18:13.744
and you guys can tell us
what you see.

18:13.788 --> 18:15.137
KATSUMOTO:
I'll shake down some CIs,
see if I can

18:15.181 --> 18:16.704
get any lead on whoever's
babysitting Magnum.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.097
Let's keep each other
in the loop, okay?

18:27.541 --> 18:29.804
[speaking foreign language]

18:35.462 --> 18:37.507
What's going on?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.901
When Tower told me
what you uncovered,

18:39.944 --> 18:43.818
I had no choice
but to call for a Chigu.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.167
Chigu?

18:45.211 --> 18:46.821
It's where two bosses
meet to hash things out

18:46.864 --> 18:49.519
with their men at a neutral
location-- a parlay.

18:49.563 --> 18:52.740
Is what Tower relayed
to me accurate?

18:52.783 --> 18:55.395
It's, uh, yeah, it's...

18:55.438 --> 18:58.398
[coughing]

18:59.703 --> 19:02.141
SHIMA:
Your symptoms...

19:02.184 --> 19:04.186
It seems

19:04.230 --> 19:06.971
you are getting me answers
just in time.

19:07.972 --> 19:11.062
Uh, yeah, yeah,
I was saying that, uh,

19:11.106 --> 19:13.195
I don't have proof yet,

19:13.239 --> 19:16.981
but all signs point to Jumak.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.593
Then...

19:19.636 --> 19:21.377
the Chigu will happen.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.162
Later today.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.862
Shima, I need that antidote.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.690
No.

19:29.733 --> 19:33.520
I didn't hire you
to figure out who took my son.

19:33.563 --> 19:37.567
I hired you... to get him back.

19:37.611 --> 19:41.745
You only have
a few hours left, so do it

19:41.789 --> 19:43.704
while you still have time.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.104
According to TC and Jin,

19:53.148 --> 19:55.977
that has got to be our
poison supplier's house.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.459
You okay?

20:00.286 --> 20:03.245
Truthfully? Not really.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.727
I mean, I'm holding it
together, obviously, but

20:06.770 --> 20:08.816
thinking about losing
Thomas is making me...

20:08.859 --> 20:10.165
Scared?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.949
And angry.

20:11.993 --> 20:14.256
I think about what life
would be like without him.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.781
And then I think what I would
do to whoever took him away.

20:17.825 --> 20:20.262
I know how you feel.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.003
Trust me. We all do.

20:24.005 --> 20:27.791
But what we need to do right now

20:27.835 --> 20:30.272
is be on our A game for Thomas.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.187
You're right.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.450
Okay, let's go.
I've got your back.

20:34.494 --> 20:36.060
I got yours.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.556
Hello. How can I help...?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.254
[groans]

20:55.297 --> 20:58.648
[panting, groaning]

20:58.692 --> 21:01.956
Now, you gave Osi Shima
a poison,

21:01.999 --> 21:03.784
and he used it on our friend.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.307
What did you give him?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.396
You realize what Shima will do
to me if I tell you?

21:07.440 --> 21:10.007
I'd be worried about
what she's gonna do to you, pal.

21:10.051 --> 21:12.619
[groaning]

21:12.662 --> 21:14.969
Okay! [panting]

21:16.100 --> 21:17.754
It was
a cholinesterase inhibitor.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.887
Great. Now tell us again
as if we're not scientists.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.063
It's a deadly poison
used in nerve agents

21:22.106 --> 21:24.239
for chemical warfare.
[grunting]

21:24.283 --> 21:26.763
Am I gonna have to choke you to
death, or are you gonna help us?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.591
[groans]
I can help!

21:28.635 --> 21:31.115
[panting]

21:35.032 --> 21:36.338
Easy.

21:36.382 --> 21:38.601
Just grabbing a vial.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.214
Give me that.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.259
Is that the antidote?

21:44.303 --> 21:45.869
No, it's atropine sulfate.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.350
It won't cure your friend,

21:48.394 --> 21:50.570
but it'll pause the symptoms
and buy him some more time.

21:50.613 --> 21:53.224
Okay. So where's the antidote?I don't have it.

21:53.268 --> 21:55.879
Really?I swear, I don't have it,
and neither does Shima.

21:55.923 --> 21:57.707
I told him I had the poison,
but not the antidote.

21:57.751 --> 22:00.797
Closest place to find it
is a lab on Maui.

22:00.841 --> 22:03.278
Shima said the poison
alone would be fine.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.847
If Shima doesn't have
the antidote...

22:06.890 --> 22:09.328
Then he never had any intention
of curing Thomas.

22:11.417 --> 22:14.071
[panting]
Tell us about this lab.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.814
This is the place.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.295
Black Taurus that staked out
Kota must be around back.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.036
But this is as far
as we can go.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.559
If the Taurus came
straight here,

22:23.603 --> 22:25.735
there's still a chance
Kota's son could be inside.

22:25.779 --> 22:29.173
Which is why you're
going in. Alone.

22:29.217 --> 22:31.741
Min and I can't risk Jumak
seeing our faces here.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.439
I don't understand.

22:33.482 --> 22:34.701
Your boss's son could be inside,

22:34.744 --> 22:36.180
and you don't want
to help look for him?

22:37.660 --> 22:39.401
You're only screwed
if you get caught.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.664
It's not about us.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.623
Shima called a Chigu
with the Jumak boss.

22:43.666 --> 22:44.928
So they're already
in negotiations

22:44.972 --> 22:46.408
about the terms of the meet.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.105
He's right.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.107
If we get caught,
that jeopardizes everything.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.588
The fragile peace between our
two organizations falls apart,

22:52.632 --> 22:53.894
and Shima wouldn't want that.

22:53.937 --> 22:55.678
He loves his son, but...

22:55.722 --> 22:57.419
[coughs softly]

22:57.463 --> 22:59.726
...he loves the yakuza more.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.510
[sighs]

23:01.554 --> 23:03.425
I guess I'm going in alone.

23:03.469 --> 23:05.906
Not exactly.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
Here.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.267
Stay in touch.

23:20.311 --> 23:22.226
Sure thing.

23:25.273 --> 23:28.363
[coughing]

23:33.803 --> 23:34.761
You good?

23:34.804 --> 23:35.892
Yeah.

23:35.936 --> 23:37.546
If I'm not back
in ten minutes,

23:37.590 --> 23:39.418
something went very badly.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.245
[coughing]

23:47.382 --> 23:48.688
[coughing]

23:48.731 --> 23:50.385
[high-pitched ringing]

24:00.134 --> 24:01.962
[door squeaking open]

24:02.005 --> 24:04.704
[electrical crackling]

24:10.536 --> 24:12.451
See anything yet?

24:12.494 --> 24:14.322
No sign of Kota yet.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.500
[indistinct voices]

24:18.544 --> 24:20.850
[panting]

24:22.591 --> 24:23.853
[men speaking foreign language]

24:23.897 --> 24:25.855
I hear them. Do not get caught.

24:25.899 --> 24:27.988
[indistinct chatter]

24:28.031 --> 24:29.990
[muffled chatter]

24:30.033 --> 24:32.514
Thanks for the advice.
I was really thinking

24:32.558 --> 24:34.473
about getting caught
until you said that.

24:36.431 --> 24:38.738
[electrical crackling]

24:49.749 --> 24:51.707
Yeah, I-I see the Taurus.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.230
Checking it out now.

24:58.627 --> 25:01.456
Okay.

25:03.066 --> 25:04.633
Find anything?

25:04.677 --> 25:07.375
There's nothing here.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.811
I'm heading back in.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.859
[high-pitched ringing][coughs]

25:14.469 --> 25:16.906
[coughing]

25:18.908 --> 25:21.258
They're coming back. [panting]

25:21.302 --> 25:23.304
MIN:
Just get back here, okay?

25:23.347 --> 25:24.435
What was that?

25:24.479 --> 25:25.524
You okay?

25:29.223 --> 25:33.009
Are you there? Thomas? Thomas?!

25:38.885 --> 25:39.842
[engine starts]What are you doing?

25:39.886 --> 25:41.757
Leaving.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.542
What are youdoing?

25:43.585 --> 25:46.196
Going in after him.Min.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.981
He got caught
with an earpiece.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.548
The Chigu's in two hours.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.158
Shima'd be pissed
if you went in there.

25:51.201 --> 25:52.768
Shima also said not
to let Magnum out of our sight.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.117
So pick your poison.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.989
No pun intended.

25:56.032 --> 25:59.470
Hey! You're on your own.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.298
I know.

26:04.214 --> 26:06.173
Don't make me ask twice.

26:06.216 --> 26:07.827
What are you doing here?

26:07.870 --> 26:12.309
I'm gonna be honest with you.
I'm not well.

26:12.353 --> 26:15.617
I can't see. [coughs]

26:15.661 --> 26:18.272
I got this bad cough.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.189
I actually thought
this was a Walgreens.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.886
[coughing]

26:23.930 --> 26:25.801
Very well.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.369
You're about
to feel a lot worse.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.721
[electrical crackling]

26:32.765 --> 26:35.028
[blow landing, yelling]

26:37.073 --> 26:39.380
[grunting]

26:42.949 --> 26:44.907
[grunting]

26:44.951 --> 26:46.692
Last chance.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.477
Yeah, I got nothing.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.087
Okay.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.437
[loud thudding]

26:58.486 --> 27:01.184
[gunfire]

27:19.725 --> 27:22.205
[groaning]

27:23.903 --> 27:25.687
[both grunting]

27:55.586 --> 27:57.937
[gunshots]

27:57.980 --> 28:00.200
[panting]

28:02.463 --> 28:04.770
Are you all right?Yeah.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.816
[coughs]

28:07.860 --> 28:09.905
[panting]

28:09.949 --> 28:12.603
Thank you.

28:12.647 --> 28:15.215
No. Thank you.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.391
You're welcome. Even
though you didn't listen

28:17.434 --> 28:19.262
to my advice about
not getting caught.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.874
I did my best.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.311
[Magnum coughing]

28:26.139 --> 28:27.749
Who are you?

28:27.793 --> 28:29.664
What do you mean?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.189
I mean, when I first starting
showing symptoms,

28:33.233 --> 28:37.019
it-it seemed like
you actually cared.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.892
What can I say?

28:39.935 --> 28:41.415
Gangster with a heart of gold.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.069
No, I'm not buying it.

28:43.112 --> 28:46.463
When you took out those men,
you-you fired your gun

28:46.507 --> 28:48.291
in a weaver stance.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.772
That's something they teach
at HPD tac training.

28:50.816 --> 28:52.731
You also used Krav Maga.

28:52.774 --> 28:54.428
That's something else
that they teach at HPD.

28:54.471 --> 28:58.171
Look, if you are
who I think you are,

28:58.214 --> 29:01.304
you know you can trust me.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.658
How long you been undercover?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.795
Two years.

29:13.839 --> 29:16.493
Special unit
of the HPD Gang Task Force.

29:16.537 --> 29:18.495
So, that time you saved Shima

29:18.539 --> 29:20.846
at the, uh... the raid--

29:20.889 --> 29:22.499
you set that all up?

29:22.543 --> 29:25.676
It was the only way to earn
my way in into the yakuza.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.504
Well done.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.158
[coughs]

29:29.202 --> 29:31.421
Look, I wish I knew more
about the poison,

29:31.465 --> 29:33.380
but Shima didn't loop me in
on it.

29:33.423 --> 29:36.644
It's fine. I got help.

29:36.687 --> 29:39.386
Is there anything else
that you can tell me

29:39.429 --> 29:41.518
about Jumak that could
potentially link them

29:41.562 --> 29:43.303
to the kidnapping?

29:43.346 --> 29:44.695
I'm guessing
you'll find out more than I know

29:44.739 --> 29:46.175
from the phone that you grabbed.

29:46.219 --> 29:48.525
But it has been tense lately,

29:48.569 --> 29:50.919
and there are some yakuza
who are fed up with the truce.

29:50.963 --> 29:52.965
They think it's time
for a change.

29:53.008 --> 29:54.705
A war might be inevitable.

29:55.489 --> 29:56.925
[phone buzzes]

29:59.623 --> 30:02.496
Damn it. Look, I got to go.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.846
But first... [sighs]

30:04.890 --> 30:06.848
I need a favor.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.936
Yeah?

30:07.980 --> 30:09.155
I need you to shoot me.

30:09.198 --> 30:11.244
Why?

30:11.287 --> 30:12.680
Tower knows
I went in to get you.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.377
Shima's gonna ask why
I didn't bring you back.

30:14.421 --> 30:15.857
I got to tell him something.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.772
Trust me, it'll look better
with a gunshot wound.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.861
You can blow cover.I'd rather take the bullet.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.864
I didn't waste two years
of my life when I am this close.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.866
If you don't shoot me,
I'm gonna do it myself.

30:24.910 --> 30:27.042
All right. Fine.

30:27.086 --> 30:29.610
Shoot here.

30:29.653 --> 30:31.481
And try not to hit bone.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.267
[sighs]

30:35.050 --> 30:36.573
On the count of three.

30:36.617 --> 30:37.879
Yeah.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.185
One...

30:39.228 --> 30:41.056
Mother! [groans]

30:41.100 --> 30:42.536
Nice count.

30:42.579 --> 30:44.538
Works every time.

30:44.581 --> 30:47.584
You all right?No, you just shot me.

30:51.806 --> 30:53.329
[coughing]

30:54.591 --> 30:56.985
Here's your phone back.
Call your friends.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.769
You don't need a ride?

30:59.640 --> 31:02.077
Nah, I'll steal one of theirs.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.210
[chuckles softly]

31:04.253 --> 31:06.690
I'll see you soon, Thomas.

31:06.734 --> 31:08.779
See ya.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.874
[phone beeps]

31:15.917 --> 31:17.876
[phone ringing]It's Magnum.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.442
Or someone calling
from his phone.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.444
Thomas?
MAGNUM:
Hey.

31:21.488 --> 31:22.750
Uh, thank God.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.187
Are you okay?Yeah, I'm fine for now.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.885
Where are you?Kapolei.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.669
Okay, we're on our way. We'll
meet you at the guesthouse.

31:28.712 --> 31:29.888
Okay.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.546
The phone you lifted
should be uploaded soon,

31:36.590 --> 31:38.853
but in the meantime,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.507
this should keep
your symptoms at bay,

31:40.550 --> 31:42.509
at least for a few hours.Yeah, well,

31:42.552 --> 31:44.119
I'll take what I can get.

31:44.163 --> 31:47.514
You know, um,
being forced to work

31:47.557 --> 31:49.864
without you has-has
reminded me of something.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.910
What's that?

31:51.953 --> 31:55.087
How much more work
I do than you do.

31:55.130 --> 31:59.004
[chuckles]I mean... it's not even close.

31:59.047 --> 32:01.571
We can debate that later.

32:01.615 --> 32:04.096
For now, it's just
good to have you back.

32:04.139 --> 32:06.925
It's good to be back.

32:08.317 --> 32:10.667
TC and Jin are almost to Maui.

32:10.711 --> 32:11.973
They should make it to the lab

32:12.017 --> 32:13.322
and return
with the antidote soon.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.498
Yeah, well,
we don't have much time

32:15.542 --> 32:17.892
to find Shima's son
before he calls off the truce.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.025
He's meeting the head
of Jumak soon.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.896
KUMU:Wait. You still want
to solve this case?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.463
Shima doesn't even
have the antidote.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.465
Yeah, well, TC'll come through.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.510
It's not about finding
the antidote anymore.

32:27.554 --> 32:28.990
It's about stopping a war
from breaking out.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.992
Well, forgive me
for being selfish,

32:31.036 --> 32:32.733
but if two gangs want
to take each other out,

32:32.776 --> 32:34.430
I'd prefer that over you

32:34.474 --> 32:35.518
putting yourself jeopardy.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.824
Nah, Magnum's right.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.000
Last time there was a war
like this, crime,

32:39.044 --> 32:40.697
drive-by shootings,
civilian casualties--

32:40.741 --> 32:42.264
they all skyrocketed.

32:42.308 --> 32:44.745
Okay, the phone's uploaded.
I'll see what I can find.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.703
MAGNUM:Yeah, I also found
something, uh,

32:46.747 --> 32:48.618
that was interesting
at the warehouse.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.098
The car that supposedly was used

32:50.142 --> 32:53.710
to stake out Shima's son
had dust all over it.

32:53.754 --> 32:55.582
Cobwebs on the tires.

32:55.625 --> 32:57.497
Means it probably
hadn't been driven

32:57.540 --> 32:59.368
for at least a few days.Yeah.

32:59.412 --> 33:02.023
So if that car wasn't used
to stake out Shima's son,

33:02.067 --> 33:04.721
then your source was either
lying or wrong. Who was it?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.506
It was Tower.Shima's guy?

33:06.549 --> 33:10.205
Yeah. Tower led us
to the warehouse, and

33:10.249 --> 33:13.208
Min said that a lot of
the yakuza guys are fed up

33:13.252 --> 33:16.211
with the gang truce
and want some change.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.560
My gut's telling me that Tower

33:17.604 --> 33:19.954
is-is framing Jumak
to start a war.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.131
Good theory, but all we have
so far is a dusty car.

33:23.175 --> 33:24.306
No, I might have more.

33:24.350 --> 33:25.916
It looks like this phone

33:25.960 --> 33:27.875
belonged to the Jumak boss's
right hand man.

33:27.918 --> 33:29.833
With this number,
I have the cell of every

33:29.877 --> 33:31.139
single Jumak member on Oahu.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.359
What'd you find?Well, it's what I didn't find.

33:33.402 --> 33:36.014
So, on the night of the
kidnapping, there are no orders,

33:36.057 --> 33:38.886
or updates or anything
regarding Kota on this phone,

33:38.929 --> 33:40.931
or on any phone that
it was in contact with.

33:40.975 --> 33:44.370
The only messages exchanged that
night were about some UFC fight.

33:44.413 --> 33:46.067
So no one from Jumak was

33:46.111 --> 33:48.026
anywhere near
Shima's son that night.

33:48.069 --> 33:51.029
And if Tower's making a power
grab and trying to frame 'em,

33:51.072 --> 33:52.639
he's got to be the guy
that grabbed Kota.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.771
Yeah, yeah. I'll take it
a step further and say that

33:54.815 --> 33:56.773
Tower had something
to do with the stolen drugs

33:56.817 --> 33:59.080
that Jumak is blaming
on the yakuza.

33:59.124 --> 34:00.995
That makes sense. Okay,
we need to get to Tower's

34:01.039 --> 34:03.693
and see if we can find any clues
as to where Shima's son is.

34:03.737 --> 34:05.086
I'll have units standing by.

34:05.130 --> 34:07.219
The second you guys
find anything, we'll move in.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.613
Great. But you guys are
gonna have to go without me.

34:10.657 --> 34:11.745
Why?

34:11.788 --> 34:14.922
I got to try and crash a meeting

34:14.965 --> 34:17.185
and stop a gang war
from breaking out on Oahu.

34:28.022 --> 34:31.112
Was pretty bold of you
to kick the door open like that.

34:31.156 --> 34:33.114
Not really. I mean, we have
the benefit of knowing

34:33.158 --> 34:35.247
Tower's at his
big meeting, so...Yeah,

34:35.290 --> 34:37.423
but I feel like he's the type
of guy who would like

34:37.466 --> 34:39.164
a big muscly dog,
you know,

34:39.207 --> 34:42.123
to compensate
for having a small...

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
brain.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.351
No sign of Kota.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.831
Well,
I found the next best thing.

34:58.835 --> 35:00.620
What are you searching for?

35:00.663 --> 35:02.143
Whatever he was
searching for.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.145
I'm looking
at his recent activity.

35:05.581 --> 35:07.757
Uh, that's a livestream
of Kota.

35:07.801 --> 35:09.368
Looks like he's alone.
No guards.

35:09.411 --> 35:10.934
He clearly isn't going anywhere.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.023
Tower must have wanted to
keep eyes on his insurance plan.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.982
Can you enlarge it?Yeah.

35:15.025 --> 35:16.636

35:16.679 --> 35:18.986

use to build condominiums.

of the island

35:20.379 --> 35:22.207
with that much construction
is Ward Village.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.165
If I can triangulate
the position of the cranes,

35:24.209 --> 35:25.732
I could figure out
which building he's in.

35:25.775 --> 35:27.429

of your shipments.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.314
So,

35:42.357 --> 35:46.187

for taking my son,

I'll give you
one last chance

to come clean about.

with the kidnapping.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.495

36:44.027 --> 36:46.204
to stop a war from breaking out.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.207

36:49.859 --> 36:51.513
Tower tracked a car

36:51.557 --> 36:54.951
that was supposedly staking out
your son to a Jumak warehouse.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.388
That car hadn't been
driven in weeks.

36:56.431 --> 36:59.173
All right, he lied about
that car to start a war.

36:59.217 --> 37:00.696
If your two gangs
take each other out,

37:00.740 --> 37:03.743

I'm assuming, him as the boss.
