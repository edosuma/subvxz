00:20.728 --> 00:23.485
- That is one fine ass cowboy.
- Really?

00:23.645 --> 00:25.111
<i>... Texas, Cash Browler!</i>

00:25.271 --> 00:26.780
Okay, if you want to choose

00:26.940 --> 00:30.200
- a guy that rides horses...
- Yes, I'm choosing him!

00:30.935 --> 00:33.662
There's this abandoned power plant,
they got copper wire out there.

00:33.822 --> 00:35.622
We were gonna go out there
and steal it.

00:35.782 --> 00:38.637
- I don't look for you to call me mom.
- Well, what do you want?

00:38.757 --> 00:41.127
I just really would love to see
if I can lend a hand.

00:41.287 --> 00:44.631
J.D. McCoy, he's got the best arm any
high school quarterback I've ever seen.

00:44.791 --> 00:46.466
I know what I've got
with Matt Saracen.

00:46.626 --> 00:49.719
If I bench him, halfway through
his senior year, it will kill him.

00:50.748 --> 00:52.180
Let's go, let's go!

00:52.567 --> 00:55.831
Hey, we run red eagle! Rig,
you're over George's side to mark...

00:55.951 --> 00:58.723
<i>Now Coach Taylor's experiment,
alternating two quarterbacks,</i>

00:58.843 --> 01:00.502
<i>is backfired in a big way.</i>

01:00.622 --> 01:03.134
<i>His team is dazed and confused.</i>

01:05.233 --> 01:07.862
<i>And that's the third
delay of game penalty.</i>

01:08.874 --> 01:10.073
What is that?!

01:12.671 --> 01:14.586
<i>Here we go again
with the switcheroo.</i>

01:14.706 --> 01:17.689
<i>McCoy is coming in for Saracen.
Buckle up, folks.</i>

01:18.199 --> 01:19.712
You stay right there!

01:20.968 --> 01:22.877
Josh, what are you doing?
Go over there.

01:23.246 --> 01:25.672
- J.D!
- On the side!

01:25.832 --> 01:27.382
Together, come on!

01:27.792 --> 01:30.510
<i>Now, J.D. McCoy
is not fairing any better.</i>

01:30.670 --> 01:33.471
<i>Coach Taylor's indecision
in picking a quarterback</i>

01:33.832 --> 01:35.515
<i>is a certified disaster.</i>

01:39.053 --> 01:40.733
<i>McNaulty over the ball...</i>

01:40.853 --> 01:43.648
<i>There's a snap, it's a fake hand off,
swing pass to the right.</i>

01:44.392 --> 01:45.275
Pick him up!

01:45.695 --> 01:49.571
<i>He cuts inside and picks up a block.
He is gonna score.</i>

01:49.731 --> 01:50.905
<i>Touchdown.</i>

01:51.229 --> 01:53.908
Oh, hell, oh, hell!

01:55.445 --> 01:58.344
<i>Panthers are coming off for lost,
and if they loose this one,</i>

01:58.464 --> 02:01.207
<i>they can kiss this season goodbye.</i>

02:02.312 --> 02:04.502
Let's keep our composed right there.
Do you understand me?

02:04.809 --> 02:07.328
Stay calm, stay steady.
They're getting confused out there.

02:07.448 --> 02:09.674
We're gonna win this game thing,
you understand?

02:09.912 --> 02:11.259
Let's go, come on.

02:36.235 --> 02:37.577
Here we go again!

02:41.699 --> 02:45.243
<i>Touchdown, he is in, folks!
Touchdown Panthers...</i>

02:45.363 --> 02:47.045
<i>Oh my, what a pass!</i>

02:48.818 --> 02:50.877
<i>Matt Saracen
has been hanging tough</i>

02:50.997 --> 02:54.776
<i>but J.D. McCoy
is </i> on fuego <i> tonight.</i>

02:55.213 --> 02:58.598
<i>The freshman has really shown
his stuff in this new offense.</i>

03:00.910 --> 03:02.728
<i>McNaulty back to the pass...</i>

03:02.888 --> 03:05.167
<i>Bubble screen to the left,
he cuts inside</i>

03:05.287 --> 03:08.216
<i>and he takes it to the barn.
Touchdown.</i>

03:08.336 --> 03:12.320
<i>This has turned out to be
one wild shoot-out, folks.</i>

03:12.480 --> 03:14.864
Let's go, bring it in!
Bring it in, let's go!

03:15.024 --> 03:17.648
Listen up, J.D, you're in,
you understand?

03:17.770 --> 03:21.413
We're going straight up the field,
play pass, we got to get what we can.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.414
You understand me?
Clock management.

03:23.574 --> 03:25.667
Let's take it to 'em.
Let's go.

03:28.644 --> 03:31.923
<i>It looks like the torch
has been passed to the freshman.</i>

03:32.083 --> 03:34.551
<i>It was Saracen's turn
but J.D. McCoy</i>

03:34.711 --> 03:37.303
<i>is coming in
with under a minute to go.</i>

03:38.346 --> 03:40.306
<i>McCoy in the shotgun,
there's the snap.</i>

03:40.682 --> 03:41.964
<i>He rose right,</i>

03:42.211 --> 03:45.270
<i>he's got Brooks on the edge,
inside the thirty yard line.</i>

03:45.430 --> 03:46.938
Let's go, let's go!

03:49.843 --> 03:51.568
<i>Now there's no more time-out</i>

03:51.728 --> 03:54.529
<i>and the clock is rolling,
they're gonna have to hurry.</i>

03:55.672 --> 03:57.574
<i>There's the snap, he looks left...</i>

03:58.379 --> 04:00.076
<i>He's got a man over the middle.</i>

04:00.236 --> 04:02.061
<i>And a nice touch pass
to Tim Riggins.</i>

04:02.181 --> 04:05.665
<i>He's down inside the fifteen to the ten.
And a big hit.</i>

04:06.221 --> 04:09.628
<i>As Tim Riggins goes down
inside the five.</i>

04:09.788 --> 04:11.114
<i>That's a first down folks,</i>

04:11.234 --> 04:14.479
<i>and that'll stop the clock
while the refs reset the ball.</i>

04:17.874 --> 04:21.209
9-29 down, key that damn defense.
You understand me? Get there, let's go.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.892
<i>And Matt Saracen
is going back into the game.</i>

04:24.052 --> 04:26.590
<i>The ball is set,
the clock is winding.</i>

04:26.710 --> 04:30.024
<i>Coach Taylor has this McNaulty defense
trying to sub</i>

04:30.144 --> 04:32.358
<i>for the Saracen offense.
But there is no time.</i>

04:32.689 --> 04:35.936
<i>We are under ten seconds, folks.
They're gonna have to hurry.</i>

04:36.300 --> 04:37.113
Blue, 8!

04:37.273 --> 04:39.204
<i>And it's too late.
There is the snap.</i>

04:39.324 --> 04:40.973
<i>It's a hand-off to Riggins...</i>

04:41.093 --> 04:44.287
<i>No! Saracen has the ball
on the keeper</i>

04:44.447 --> 04:46.571
<i>What a call!
Touchdown.</i>

04:46.691 --> 04:49.557
<i>My grandmother
could have walked that one in.</i>

04:49.677 --> 04:52.335
<i>Panthers win, Panthers win!</i>

05:03.957 --> 05:06.135
- Good game, Matt!
- You too.

05:12.554 --> 05:16.465
<i>Let's the coronation begin.
There's another king in the castle:</i>

05:16.585 --> 05:19.948
<i>J.D. "young gun" McCoy
has arrived</i>

05:20.108 --> 05:22.533
<i>and he is the real deal, my friends!</i>

06:22.523 --> 06:25.422
Thank you for doing that, honey.
I appreciate that.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.016
What is that mess on your leg?

06:28.176 --> 06:31.043
Were you drawing on yourself
with pens or something?

06:31.762 --> 06:34.439
It's a tattoo. Do you guys
want tortilla soup on your salad?

06:35.371 --> 06:38.179
Like a little lick-n-stick tattoo?
That seems a little...

06:38.299 --> 06:40.001
A little young, doesn't it, for you?

06:40.121 --> 06:42.572
I've a real tattoo,
the ones lick-n-stick are modeled after.

06:47.204 --> 06:48.645
What did you... What?

06:49.246 --> 06:50.246
You're kidding?

06:51.458 --> 06:52.660
It's a tattoo.

06:52.983 --> 06:55.168
- Where do you have a tattoo?
- On my ankle.

06:55.328 --> 06:58.880
What were you thinking?
Why did you get a tattoo? Honey!

06:59.316 --> 07:02.119
What? I was walking home from work,
and I had my paycheck,

07:02.239 --> 07:04.719
- I've always wanted one so I bought it.
- You got to be kidding me.

07:05.182 --> 07:08.431
I knew that job was a terrible idea.
You have permanently

07:08.591 --> 07:11.684
- marked your body. Your beautiful body.
- Is that what you do with your money?

07:11.844 --> 07:14.614
Your skin is now ruined.
Do you realize that? Forever.

07:14.734 --> 07:17.231
- What were you thinking?
- Tyra said you'd get upset about it.

07:17.512 --> 07:20.485
What? Tyra? What do you want Tyra
to have to do with anything?

07:20.645 --> 07:23.404
- Tyra was there when I got it.
- Well, that's just fascinating.

07:23.853 --> 07:25.698
Really? That's fascinating?

07:26.486 --> 07:29.077
- Don't you dare talk to me like that.
- It's a tattoo, mum.

07:29.237 --> 07:30.870
It's this big,
you're acting as though

07:31.030 --> 07:33.289
I have giant, like,
dancing Popeye on my biceps...

07:33.654 --> 07:36.251
- Don't be a smart ass.
- I'm not being a smart ass.

07:36.371 --> 07:40.088
I'm telling you, it's done, it's over,
it's on my leg. Too late.

07:50.858 --> 07:54.278
You've thrown away my porn again?
I ain't finished with this one yet.

07:54.398 --> 07:56.490
I'm pretty sure, I can tell
what comes out in the end.

07:56.610 --> 08:00.140
Dude, you do not have
to hide porn from a baby.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.441
Babies are not freaked out
by boobies.

08:02.561 --> 08:04.737
There's more than boobs
in those magazines, first of all.

08:04.897 --> 08:06.840
What? Vaginas?
Babies love vaginas, man.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.286
They took a trip through one.
It's like looking at a postcard.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.328
How many times do I have to tell you?
Clean up all this before the baby comes.

08:12.488 --> 08:14.372
- OK?
- Baby's here. Baby's here.

08:14.629 --> 08:17.179
- There's the little monkey.
- Hey, guys.

08:17.435 --> 08:19.001
- How's it going?
- How's the boy?

08:19.161 --> 08:20.767
He's doing well.

08:23.114 --> 08:24.579
Someone is wiped out.

08:25.454 --> 08:27.885
Hey, little man! You wake up
a little bit and we'll play, okay?

08:29.657 --> 08:33.349
I'll be working an extra three-hours
shift tonight. I'll be back by ten.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.462
- To pick him up.
- Alright.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.145
OK, bye, precious.

08:38.738 --> 08:39.741
Look...

08:40.333 --> 08:44.301
You know, Erin, ten o'clock,
it's awfully late to be moving Noah.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.749
Maybe he could sleep over.

08:49.389 --> 08:51.070
Or he can just move in.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.746
Our names are next to each other
on the birth certificate.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.866
I figured it'd be easy enough to
put them next to each other on a lease.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.085
Or you can just pick Noah up at ten.

09:02.775 --> 09:05.173
God, I wish it was that easy.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.466
I wish I could think about

09:08.145 --> 09:09.863
long-term things but...

09:10.116 --> 09:11.966
Well, I'm still trying
to get more hours

09:12.086 --> 09:14.942
at the dealership so you can
come back to part-time.

09:15.468 --> 09:18.518
- It's just...
- I know. Car sales suck right now.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.814
I'll come up with plenty
of more money though, I promise.

09:23.215 --> 09:25.443
I know you're working hard,
thank you.

09:26.684 --> 09:28.154
Don't work too hard, okay?

09:28.492 --> 09:30.539
- Be good.
- Bye, mama.

09:30.774 --> 09:32.158
- Bye.
- See you at ten.

09:41.102 --> 09:42.198
Damn it, Missy.

09:42.318 --> 09:45.129
No, I do not understand
why you haven't sold this house yet.

09:45.974 --> 09:48.241
It's steal at 250.

09:48.556 --> 09:51.363
No, don't tell me that,
that's just an excuse.

09:51.556 --> 09:53.351
Listen, I'll leave or take 220.

09:53.471 --> 09:55.765
Yes, I will. I'll take 220.
Just get the thing sold.

09:56.348 --> 09:59.194
No, I don't want to hear
your excuses, Missy.

09:59.465 --> 10:00.519
Listen, I...

10:00.679 --> 10:03.564
I've been a salesman my whole life.
Don't tell me how to sell.

10:04.179 --> 10:07.766
All right, here's what you do.
You go out and you just tell everyone

10:08.132 --> 10:12.377
that when all the scared rats
are leaving a sinking market,

10:12.497 --> 10:15.314
that's when a real entrepreneur
steps in.

10:15.752 --> 10:17.243
A true visionary.

10:17.363 --> 10:19.121
You say it, just like that. No...

10:19.281 --> 10:23.084
I am emerging money here,
Missy, why... Wait!

10:23.378 --> 10:26.800
Those guys are gonna come out
on a black, 8 parade, Coach Crowley.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.916
Slide the sandbag over,
and punch him in the mouth.

10:29.036 --> 10:32.343
We go double Y, motion away,
he's gotta drop and cover.

10:32.980 --> 10:36.121
Matt and J.D. will need two more
wideouts if we stay with spread.

10:36.241 --> 10:38.762
- You understand that, don't you?
- What about our power game, Coach?

10:38.882 --> 10:41.936
- None of them {\guys }can leave the block.
- We sub in an out-and-down distance,

10:42.096 --> 10:43.920
start double flex,
it works for both of them.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.357
You want to install another set?
Another set?

10:46.889 --> 10:48.985
As more blocking schemes, more raps?

10:49.145 --> 10:51.529
More zone reach for Matt and J.D?

10:51.689 --> 10:55.449
- Good, it'd place our strength.
- No, our strength is J.D. McCoy, Coach.

10:59.318 --> 11:00.392
Go on.

11:02.725 --> 11:04.749
All right, we've beaten McNaulty.

11:05.001 --> 11:07.442
And it was a great strategy
to platoon that game,

11:07.562 --> 11:09.078
but we're done with that.

11:09.198 --> 11:10.569
We're passed that.

11:11.817 --> 11:13.339
Matt's a tough kid.

11:13.855 --> 11:15.226
He'll be all right.

11:15.996 --> 11:18.246
And he deserves all of our respect.

11:19.035 --> 11:21.101
And we all feel this, Coach.

11:23.505 --> 11:25.843
But you've got to tell him
the truth, Eric.

11:29.341 --> 11:32.528
There's gotta be something big,
people don't have what they need.

11:33.542 --> 11:36.684
- All right, you got any ideas?
- Sharp pencil.

11:38.299 --> 11:41.454
You're onto something. We'll invent
the pencil sharpener all over again.

11:42.517 --> 11:44.067
Come on, seriously...

11:44.212 --> 11:46.254
Think about, like...
little things.

11:47.118 --> 11:48.544
Like post-it notes.

11:48.704 --> 11:51.755
- Just got to focus, you know.
- No, you're right, you're right.

11:53.627 --> 11:55.577
I got nothing. I got nothing.

11:57.510 --> 12:00.260
You could always flip
Buddy Garrity's house.

12:01.173 --> 12:03.142
What are you talking about?
It's not an invention.

12:03.302 --> 12:05.853
Well, his house
is on the market for 250.

12:06.013 --> 12:08.230
I happen to know he'll take 220.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.194
Maybe you throw a 30 in there
and sell it for 350.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.937
I mean, it's flipping houses,
I saw it on TV, it works.

12:14.057 --> 12:16.822
Okay, well guess what, genius?
House market sucks right now.

12:16.982 --> 12:18.057
Yeah.

12:18.177 --> 12:21.923
Yeah, it's when all the scared rats are
running away from a sinking market

12:22.043 --> 12:24.264
that the real entrepreneurs come in.

12:24.987 --> 12:26.749
The true visionaries.

12:33.397 --> 12:35.883
Well, I'm good with design
and you know this.

12:36.717 --> 12:39.173
220 thousands?
What's this? It's a steal.

12:39.315 --> 12:42.598
220,000? How much
would down payment need for 220,000?

12:42.962 --> 12:44.267
35 grand.

12:45.243 --> 12:47.093
Yeah, but I don't have that.

12:49.071 --> 12:51.488
Billy and I have
some copper wire money.

12:51.608 --> 12:52.781
So I mean...

12:53.601 --> 12:55.341
We'd all go in on it, but...

12:55.461 --> 12:57.571
The only is, you got
to convince that guy.

13:21.866 --> 13:22.983
Hey, Coach.

13:26.394 --> 13:28.485
J.D. is gonna start Friday.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.814
All right?
You're gonna be QB 2.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.042
Okay...

13:40.182 --> 13:41.965
Listen, I want you to know...

13:42.916 --> 13:46.020
- I'm willing for making this decision.
- I know.

13:46.140 --> 13:47.872
Oh, my lord, have mercy.

13:48.032 --> 13:50.624
Coach Eric Taylor, how are you?

13:50.884 --> 13:54.420
- Hello, Mrs. Saracen.
- Mercy! What a surprise to see you

13:54.580 --> 13:56.126
- on my door step.
- How are you?

13:56.246 --> 13:58.092
I'm great.
Have you had supper?

13:58.212 --> 14:00.235
Yes, ma'am, I have.
Yes, I have.

14:00.355 --> 14:03.053
- I would like to fix you something.
- I appreciate that.

14:03.213 --> 14:05.514
Yes, ma'am, I've already...
Thank you very much.

14:06.925 --> 14:09.316
- Hello, how do you do?
- It's my mother.

14:13.065 --> 14:14.981
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

14:15.101 --> 14:17.401
- I heard a lot about you.
- This man walks on water.

14:18.742 --> 14:20.085
Walks on water!

14:20.205 --> 14:22.587
- And he's a hero in this house.
- Thank you very much.

14:22.707 --> 14:25.974
I'm gonna get you just something little
that maybe you can take at home.

14:26.094 --> 14:28.868
I don't mind to be it.
I don't mind to be it.

14:33.394 --> 14:35.668
Tell your grandma thank you,
would you?

14:38.527 --> 14:39.715
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.259
- Very nice to meet you.
- That's nice to meet you, too.

14:49.301 --> 14:50.562
Are you okay?

14:54.714 --> 14:55.822
I'm fine.

15:00.155 --> 15:01.957
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

15:24.018 --> 15:27.293
I'm sorry. I understand you're hurting.
This is power ballets?

15:27.413 --> 15:29.590
Really? How cliché can you be?

15:52.352 --> 15:53.831
Well, let's go.

15:58.073 --> 15:59.252
What's going on, Tyra?

15:59.784 --> 16:00.795
Nothing.

16:02.817 --> 16:04.200
Nothing's going on?

16:04.751 --> 16:05.925
No, really.

16:06.613 --> 16:09.162
Cause where I sit,
I see you and your senior year

16:09.282 --> 16:11.496
kinda going off the deep end
a little bit.

16:11.616 --> 16:13.281
And you've been skipping school,

16:13.401 --> 16:17.313
and Mr. Tracton said you just
completely screwed up a history test.

16:18.175 --> 16:20.307
You win some, you loose some.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.738
Who's the guy in the truck?

16:26.454 --> 16:27.528
Excuse me?

16:27.941 --> 16:31.491
That man that has been dropping you off
at school every day.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.626
I think I'm allowed
to have a boyfriend, Mrs. T.

16:35.746 --> 16:39.084
You are allowed to have a boyfriend.
He didn't look like a boy to me.

16:40.149 --> 16:42.578
And I tell you right now,
if that relationship is anything

16:42.698 --> 16:45.841
like what I can imagine it is,
that is a one-way ticket to nowhere.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.367
I don't see it as any of your business,
to be honest with you.

16:49.487 --> 16:52.889
I feel like it is my business,
because I've made an investment in you.

16:53.569 --> 16:56.523
And because I care about you.
I feel like we've made it this far,

16:56.643 --> 16:57.646
together.

16:59.278 --> 17:02.474
And I don't like what I'm seeing.
I don't like it.

17:02.877 --> 17:06.550
So look, we think we can turn
this thing over, about 30 days time.

17:06.929 --> 17:09.546
And get you a 20% profit
on your investment.

17:09.715 --> 17:12.005
Now, you ain't gonna get
a return like that anywhere else

17:12.125 --> 17:13.992
it doesn't involve
some crazy ass risk.

17:16.183 --> 17:18.915
How do I know
this isn't some crazy ass risk?

17:19.781 --> 17:21.584
- Excellent question, Billy.
- That's good.

17:21.744 --> 17:23.670
I tell you why.
Cause people need housing.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.255
And in this neck of the woods,
there's a serious lack of

17:26.415 --> 17:27.742
upgraded upscale housing.

17:27.863 --> 17:30.970
Now, I did some research.
The good houses, they go. Quick.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.071
I don't know, Jason.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.016
It's a lot at stake here.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.851
You know? This is my money
to start a new life with Mindy.

17:39.527 --> 17:41.771
It's a lot at stake here
for all of us, Billy.

17:41.891 --> 17:44.524
And that's how I know it's gonna work,
cause we're all gonna get together

17:44.685 --> 17:46.318
- and make it work.
- Teamwork.

17:46.625 --> 17:49.070
It's when all the scared rats
start running away

17:49.231 --> 17:52.341
from the sinking market that
the true entrepreneurs come in, Billy.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.368
True visionaries.

17:57.922 --> 17:59.748
- I'm a visionary.
- Look at you.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.379
- I'm in.
- Grand!

18:07.552 --> 18:10.843
- Really?
- Yeah, let's do this! So what's next?

18:11.003 --> 18:13.636
We go to the bank tomorrow
to get details on the loan.

18:13.797 --> 18:16.889
We'll probably need a check, though.
From you guys, for the down payment.

18:17.344 --> 18:19.893
- It's gonna be great!
- Alright!

18:26.090 --> 18:28.540
Hey, there, beautiful.
What you looking at?

18:29.748 --> 18:31.572
I just got a C- at my history test.

18:32.186 --> 18:35.159
C-? My mom would
make me cake for a C-.

18:35.546 --> 18:37.312
Well, you were trying
to be a cowboy,

18:37.432 --> 18:39.482
I'm trying to get into college.
A little different.

18:39.602 --> 18:42.290
So, how did that meeting
go at the school?

18:42.878 --> 18:44.454
Alright, I guess.

18:44.869 --> 18:47.503
- She doesn't like you very much.
- They usually don't.

18:49.166 --> 18:52.294
No, it's not like she thinks you're bad
or anything. She...

18:52.414 --> 18:55.470
thinks you're some cowboy who just
wanders around from town to town.

18:56.722 --> 18:57.722
You met me!

18:58.504 --> 19:01.468
I like to think
there's more in you than that.

19:02.497 --> 19:05.564
Sometimes, {\I guess }it just takes the right
woman to make it more in your heart.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.823
- Didn't you take some this morning?
- I did just take it this morning.

19:14.983 --> 19:17.217
- You ever been thrown off a horse?
- No.

19:17.337 --> 19:19.776
It ain't like the aching
goes away real quick.

19:19.896 --> 19:23.290
I wouldn't take it if it didn't hurt.
But that hurts. A lot.

19:35.804 --> 19:37.034
I feel old.

19:40.033 --> 19:43.102
I feel old, and out of control.

19:44.479 --> 19:46.730
Why would she go
and get a tattoo like that?

19:46.850 --> 19:49.520
- I don't know.
- Why would she do that?

19:49.690 --> 19:53.487
You know, it's a rose, and a heart,
and a... What does that even mean?

19:53.966 --> 19:56.257
You know, a lot of kids
are getting tattoos

19:56.377 --> 19:58.117
and it doesn't have
to mean anything.

19:58.277 --> 20:01.195
No, honey, it means something.
For sure.

20:02.531 --> 20:05.213
Frankly, it doesn't make me feel
any better knowing Tyra was involved.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.210
That girl is just off the deep end
this year.

20:08.370 --> 20:10.712
I don't know what
is going on with her.

20:10.832 --> 20:14.416
I think she's becoming
a good old-fashioned bad influence.

20:15.864 --> 20:18.273
And that is a slippery slope.

20:20.831 --> 20:22.181
What do you mean?

20:22.875 --> 20:25.235
You know, parties, boys...

20:27.262 --> 20:28.377
Drugs...

20:30.184 --> 20:32.162
I see it at school every day.

20:33.604 --> 20:35.701
Not while she's my girl, no, sir.

20:40.692 --> 20:42.661
Thank God, you are here!

20:43.512 --> 20:45.068
Little man giving you trouble?

20:45.188 --> 20:47.916
Yeah. He's just so fussy, tonight.
I mean...

20:48.076 --> 20:51.235
I have no idea why,
and I've got to get some sleep

20:51.355 --> 20:53.341
or I'm gonna pass out...

20:53.511 --> 20:55.716
I don't know,
you have a way with him

20:55.938 --> 20:57.967
- of making him...
- Take a break, okay?

20:58.177 --> 21:00.303
I got some exciting news
to tell you.

21:00.514 --> 21:02.555
I got some irons on the fire.
Things are looking...

21:05.268 --> 21:07.235
Things are looking up, so...

21:08.395 --> 21:09.777
Don't go anywhere.

21:15.182 --> 21:18.113
Mile Launder Road.
This feels legit, Billy...

21:18.273 --> 21:21.973
We need the cash, okay? We have
to be at the bank in the morning.

21:24.071 --> 21:25.930
Are you kidding me?
Guy Raston?

21:26.050 --> 21:28.596
- Just calm down.
- You wanna deal with this cat?

21:28.716 --> 21:30.917
Look, man, we didn't have
anyone else to go to...

21:31.037 --> 21:33.817
- Anyone would have been better!
- Look at them!

21:34.374 --> 21:36.099
If it ain't the Duke boys.

21:36.411 --> 21:37.961
They always come back.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.690
How you doing, Timmy?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.015
How's football, man?

21:54.076 --> 21:56.026
Did you lose some weight, man?

21:57.050 --> 21:59.206
Alright. I give you 10.

21:59.578 --> 22:01.110
That'll work.

22:02.288 --> 22:03.597
You want all 3?

22:04.111 --> 22:06.245
That's what I just said.
I give you 10 for all 3.

22:06.830 --> 22:09.372
- 10 grand for 3 spools? It's worth...
- Make it 8.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.917
- Give me 2 for my hooker.
- What is going on here, Guy?

22:12.077 --> 22:14.835
We talked about this. You know what kind
of legwork I had to do to get...

22:14.996 --> 22:18.257
Man, I feel sorry about that.
But do we got a deal, or what?

22:18.890 --> 22:21.259
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Seriously, listen!

22:21.470 --> 22:24.055
- We're way in over our heads right now.
- He's robbing us.

22:24.175 --> 22:26.014
{\We robbed these.}
We gotta be at the bank, tomorrow.

22:26.174 --> 22:27.535
I don't care, man.

22:27.655 --> 22:30.476
You guys gonna make a deal
or sit around arguing like dumb asses?

22:30.637 --> 22:32.019
What the hell did you call me?

22:33.853 --> 22:35.994
I called you a dumb ass, Billy.

22:36.164 --> 22:39.945
A stupid, short, white-trash,
red-neck dumb ass.

22:40.616 --> 22:42.103
But it ain't all bad,

22:43.530 --> 22:46.944
cause, boy, that Mindy gets
one hell of a VIP dance, doesn't she?

22:49.614 --> 22:52.374
- Billy, let's go.
- That's good, man.

22:53.765 --> 22:55.877
Billy, come on!
Get off!

22:59.875 --> 23:01.008
Go to the truck!

23:02.671 --> 23:04.094
Go, go, go!

23:11.545 --> 23:13.020
Get down!
Get down!

23:24.938 --> 23:26.288
You like that one.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.621
Hey, son, I got some news for you.

23:32.183 --> 23:34.207
Your daddy'll buy a house today.

23:36.088 --> 23:38.896
But don't get too excited,
cause it's not for us to live in.

23:39.016 --> 23:41.686
I'm gonna fix it up.
Then I'm gonna sell it.

23:42.061 --> 23:44.468
Then you and me, and your mommy...

23:45.279 --> 23:46.638
can live together.

23:49.172 --> 23:50.711
Yeah, I like it, too.

24:25.597 --> 24:29.104
I understand that your friends are late.
I'm sure there's a explanation

24:29.224 --> 24:31.722
but unfortunately,
we have to have everyone present.

24:32.727 --> 24:36.061
- That shower could be keeping them.
- They'll be here, though.

24:36.181 --> 24:39.606
- They will definitely be here.
- Always late, but worth the wait,

24:39.766 --> 24:41.636
as those license plates always say.

24:41.756 --> 24:43.485
Just a few minutes, Barb,
I promise.

24:52.181 --> 24:53.835
You got a plan?
What are we gonna tell?

24:53.955 --> 24:56.783
Awesome! The idiot brigade is here.
It's only 45 minutes late.

24:56.903 --> 24:59.000
- And where is your suit?
- We got a little messed up.

24:59.919 --> 25:02.879
No thanks to you 2,
the bank has approved our loan.

25:03.131 --> 25:04.131
No way...

25:04.251 --> 25:06.299
We played the crippled
football stars not giving up.

25:06.648 --> 25:08.676
Our guy was so emotional,
so believable.

25:08.930 --> 25:11.033
Cause I'm a crippled football star
who's not giving up.

25:11.153 --> 25:13.404
Where is the money?
We gotta put it in the bank by tomorrow.

25:13.524 --> 25:15.246
This loan depends on it.

25:16.645 --> 25:19.351
- We had a little hiccup.
- What kind of hiccup?

25:20.065 --> 25:23.202
- Well, its a...
- OK, remember when I said...

25:23.785 --> 25:27.360
Remember when I said we have
a lot of copper wire money?

25:28.054 --> 25:30.906
What I meant to say was
we just have a lot of copper wire.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.622
Like a lot.

25:32.742 --> 25:35.536
It's not exactly liquid.
I guess it's the term...

25:35.656 --> 25:39.145
I'm pretty sure I know how to explain
exactly what's at stake, here, Billy.

25:39.265 --> 25:40.963
Telling somebody something is liquid

25:41.083 --> 25:44.158
when it's not quite liquid
is a pretty dumb ass thing to do.

25:44.278 --> 25:47.132
Let's not start with the name calling.
Otherwise, I'll walk right out of here.

25:47.292 --> 25:49.675
It's not fair. I can't punch you,
you're in a wheelchair.

25:49.836 --> 25:53.304
I'll swing back. Just ask your brother.
You wanna take this outside, shorty?

25:55.592 --> 25:56.891
OK, you're in public.

25:59.389 --> 26:00.398
Ladies,

26:01.516 --> 26:04.441
let me take a gander at that wire.
I might know a guy.

26:14.465 --> 26:15.791
Is everything OK?

26:16.211 --> 26:20.193
Oh yeah, she just needs a lot of water.
I don't remember she gets angry.

26:20.362 --> 26:22.249
It's really a codependent thing
going on.

26:24.959 --> 26:26.253
As long as you're OK.

26:28.929 --> 26:31.374
Actually, I wandered
looking for something to buy you.

26:31.712 --> 26:34.194
I stopped at this little hair salon
in town,

26:34.314 --> 26:36.945
that little place, you know,
on 7th street...

26:37.496 --> 26:38.497
and...

26:39.032 --> 26:40.928
Anyway, they had a chair opened.

26:41.048 --> 26:43.219
And... that means I can rent it.

26:44.290 --> 26:48.211
And I guess, you know, if I did rent it,
I'd be living here for a while...

26:48.741 --> 26:51.146
help out, till you graduate.

26:54.718 --> 26:56.458
You do whatever you want.

27:07.638 --> 27:10.888
- It's premium stuff, man.
- That's an understatement.

27:11.747 --> 27:14.302
- Is it all you got?
- All I got?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.305
Yeah, that's all we got.

27:18.602 --> 27:21.726
We can make a deal, man.
How does 20 sound?

27:22.444 --> 27:23.447
Grand?

27:23.730 --> 27:25.084
Yeah, 20 grand.

27:25.722 --> 27:29.316
- I gotta confer with my people first.
- Why?

27:29.917 --> 27:30.943
Let's do it.

27:39.396 --> 27:40.704
That'll work.

28:45.719 --> 28:48.103
I've never seen anything
like that before.

28:48.314 --> 28:49.799
I figured you hadn't.

29:09.753 --> 29:12.099
Can we come in
and talk to you for a sec?

29:12.508 --> 29:13.629
Yeah, sure.

29:15.170 --> 29:17.467
Your mother and I would like
to have a conversation

29:18.432 --> 29:20.804
- about the tattoo, right?
- However with calm.

29:23.218 --> 29:25.100
- We want...
- What the hell were you thinking?

29:25.260 --> 29:26.643
Hon! What we mean is...

29:26.963 --> 29:30.813
We'd like to have a better understanding
of what your thought process was.

29:30.974 --> 29:32.981
Just what I was saying.
What were you thinking?

29:33.142 --> 29:36.610
- It's not a big deal. Everyone has one.
- Yes, honey. It is a big deal.

29:36.771 --> 29:39.322
It's a big deal and the biggest deal
is you never discussed it

29:39.482 --> 29:41.157
with your father or with me.

29:41.317 --> 29:45.077
- Because you guys would've said no.
- You're damn right we would've said no!

29:45.345 --> 29:48.290
- Well, you wonder why I don't ask you.
- {\If we would've }Say no or not is not the point.

29:48.410 --> 29:49.665
What's the point?

29:49.826 --> 29:52.969
This is not like you. And if there's
something going on in your life

29:53.089 --> 29:55.170
that you feel you need
to talk about with us,

29:55.331 --> 29:58.048
we want you to be able to share that
with us. We want to understand

29:58.209 --> 30:00.843
- what this is about.
- It doesn't mean anything!

30:01.004 --> 30:04.481
If it doesn't mean anything,
let's just go on and have it removed.

30:04.601 --> 30:08.143
I looked into a place in San Antonio,
it's very reputable,

30:08.303 --> 30:10.352
and we're gonna go
and get it removed.

30:10.775 --> 30:13.818
- You two have fun, cause I'm not going.
- It's not your decision to make.

30:13.938 --> 30:16.443
- Last I checked, it's on my ankle.
- You know what?

30:16.603 --> 30:20.155
Until you're 18 years old,
it's not your ankle, OK? It's my ankle.

30:20.315 --> 30:23.175
So we're going to San Antonio on Friday
and we're getting it removed.

30:23.295 --> 30:24.725
End of conversation.

30:26.331 --> 30:28.078
I sold your house, Buddy.

30:28.699 --> 30:31.248
- It's my pleasure, it's my job.
- I knew you could do it, Missy.

30:31.459 --> 30:34.813
- Just need you to...
- You're making me one happy guy.

30:35.452 --> 30:36.588
Perfect.

30:37.190 --> 30:39.643
- Oh, good.
- This is... good.

30:40.331 --> 30:41.490
Piece of cake.

30:42.420 --> 30:46.176
What are these names?
Billy and Tim Riggins, and Jason Street?

30:46.296 --> 30:47.640
What's this?

30:48.362 --> 30:49.821
They're the buyers.

30:56.615 --> 30:58.358
Alright. This is the American dream.

30:58.519 --> 31:00.611
- To the American dream.
- Owner of a house.

31:00.820 --> 31:02.007
Alright.

31:06.545 --> 31:07.857
That didn't go down well.

31:07.977 --> 31:10.997
- It is known that you got a pink shirt.
- Shut up, man.

31:13.313 --> 31:14.339
Hey, Missy.

31:15.668 --> 31:16.668
Is Buddy happy?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.837
<i>- Not exactly.
- What does he want? More money?</i>

31:19.058 --> 31:22.383
No, he's not gonna sell you the house.
Mr. Garrity was happy with the offer

31:22.543 --> 31:24.400
<i>till he saw your names on it.</i>

31:24.859 --> 31:26.721
What did he say?
Guys!

31:27.045 --> 31:29.649
Something in the vane of
the house can rot into the ground

31:29.769 --> 31:32.184
before I sell it to these
clam cord idiots.

31:32.666 --> 31:35.247
- I think it was a pass.
- Thanks.

31:36.303 --> 31:37.553
Don't shush me!

31:45.703 --> 31:47.350
- Hey, Mrs. T.
- Hey.

31:48.209 --> 31:49.696
I just wanted to...

31:51.747 --> 31:53.498
You've done a lot for me...

31:54.024 --> 31:56.284
You've been there for me,
and you've...

31:56.889 --> 31:58.043
always come through.

31:58.204 --> 32:01.042
Which means there are...
very few people in my life who

32:01.568 --> 32:03.118
I can say that about.

32:04.669 --> 32:06.668
It means a lot.
It really does.

32:06.788 --> 32:07.788
Thank you.

32:08.638 --> 32:09.638
But...

32:10.172 --> 32:12.058
you're wrong about Cash.

32:12.966 --> 32:15.517
- I know you think he's a bad guy.
- I don't think he's a bad guy.

32:15.637 --> 32:17.975
Well, bad for me.
Whatever, but...

32:19.334 --> 32:20.464
you're wrong.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.572
He's such a good guy.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.857
He really is.

32:32.558 --> 32:33.610
Okay...

32:36.656 --> 32:39.495
I don't care about Cash.
I just care about you.

32:40.371 --> 32:42.463
- It's not my priority straight.
- Well...

32:43.465 --> 32:44.923
that's what I wanna see.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.168
Thank you.

33:17.797 --> 33:21.094
- What the hell are you doing?
- I do whatever you ask me to.

33:21.214 --> 33:24.165
I helped you win the State championship.
I got you to 3 to 1 this season.

33:24.285 --> 33:27.424
I work my ass off at practice.
I do everything that you say.

33:28.370 --> 33:31.392
If it's cause J.D. is better than me,
tell me that.

33:33.546 --> 33:36.719
My job is to fill a team out there
that wins games.

33:36.839 --> 33:39.646
Right now,
that means J.D. McCoy. Yes.

33:51.265 --> 33:53.618
- Then I quit.
- You're not quitting this team.

33:53.778 --> 33:55.911
I'm not gonna let you quit.
I know you.

33:56.072 --> 33:58.166
You quit this team,
you gonna hate yourself.

33:58.286 --> 34:01.459
You wanna be pissed? Fine go ahead.
You be pissed. I don't give a damn.

34:02.096 --> 34:04.246
But you're not quitting this team.

34:08.402 --> 34:09.402
Fine.

34:11.257 --> 34:13.101
Fine, I'll sit on your bench.

34:14.009 --> 34:17.367
I'll come to practice
and I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

34:18.922 --> 34:20.469
But I'm gonna hate it.

34:22.724 --> 34:24.395
And you're gonna hate it.

34:28.772 --> 34:29.902
Good talk, Coach.

34:39.013 --> 34:42.666
It's not you, Jason. It's not about you.
It's about Riggins.

34:42.974 --> 34:45.036
Riggins has got my daughter,
as you well know.

34:45.157 --> 34:48.331
And just between you and me,
I'm not real fired up about it.

34:48.541 --> 34:50.618
I mean, Tim is great
on a football field,

34:50.737 --> 34:52.510
but I really don't realist the idea

34:52.670 --> 34:55.096
of him being the father
of my grandchildren.

34:55.453 --> 34:56.942
You know what I mean?

34:57.834 --> 34:59.641
And I can't talk to Lyla about this.

35:00.049 --> 35:02.167
I love that little girl.
She's all I've got left.

35:02.287 --> 35:05.096
But if I talk to her about him,
she's gonna hate me.

35:05.216 --> 35:08.008
I'm not gonna let those Riggins
buy the house! It's ridiculous!

35:08.128 --> 35:11.203
Let me put it this way.
You're not selling Riggins the house.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.531
You're selling me the house.

35:14.293 --> 35:17.609
And you'd do that, wouldn't you?
You'd sell that house to me.

35:20.092 --> 35:21.535
I can buy your house.

35:22.010 --> 35:24.660
But I can't buy it
without those guys, OK?

35:25.061 --> 35:27.366
And I got a baby now.
Alright?

35:28.377 --> 35:30.628
And I've got a woman
that I love to death

35:30.748 --> 35:32.947
that is keeping me an arm's length,
until I can show her

35:33.067 --> 35:35.770
that I know how to make real money
in this world.

35:36.209 --> 35:37.888
And buying your house
is the first step.

35:38.486 --> 35:40.936
And I'm not gonna
take no for an answer.

35:43.702 --> 35:46.319
If you ever cared about me
as a person, Mr. Garrity,

35:46.439 --> 35:48.315
if you ever cared about me
as a player,

35:49.190 --> 35:51.747
as the quarterback
of the Dillon Panthers,

35:51.867 --> 35:53.320
then you will sell me that house.

35:54.859 --> 35:56.930
Look, Mr. Garrity.
You remember...

35:58.439 --> 36:00.848
You remember when I was a sophomore?

36:01.198 --> 36:04.954
We had that last regular season game
against Midland, that year.

36:07.354 --> 36:10.268
We needed to win that game
to go to the playoffs. Remember?

36:10.388 --> 36:12.338
4th quarter, we're down by 6.

36:12.974 --> 36:16.016
2 minutes left to go.
We drive right down that field.

36:16.136 --> 36:17.875
We end up at the 4th to go.

36:18.901 --> 36:21.137
I step back into that dark,
and there...

36:21.257 --> 36:22.838
I sent a quick slant...

36:23.210 --> 36:25.393
I hit that receiver right scoring...

36:25.736 --> 36:27.730
Touchdown! State playoffs!
You remember that?

36:31.765 --> 36:32.894
That was good.

36:33.422 --> 36:34.790
That guy...

36:36.366 --> 36:38.406
That guy is who you're gonna
sell that house to.

36:49.287 --> 36:51.423
You wanna think big, man.
Vaulted ceilings.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.047
What are you talking about?
You know how much this is gonna cost?

36:54.257 --> 36:56.663
- That's ridiculous.
- What are you talking about?

36:56.783 --> 36:59.929
Raise the ceiling.
This house is stuck in the 60's, man.

37:00.098 --> 37:01.930
You get rid of all
this textured wood crap.

37:02.141 --> 37:04.737
- Raise the ceiling.
- You wanna get rid of the wood?

37:04.857 --> 37:06.685
I don't know, man.
I kinda...

37:06.846 --> 37:09.568
- He wouldn't like the wood, you idiot.
- Why you go with the name calling?

37:09.688 --> 37:12.618
- I'm not calling you an idiot.
- This crappy wood, Billy?

37:12.738 --> 37:15.190
What are you talking about?
You want cottage cheese on the ceiling?

37:15.310 --> 37:17.539
No, I don't want
cottage cheese ceiling, OK?

37:17.659 --> 37:19.447
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

37:19.608 --> 37:20.992
Guys, guys!

37:21.152 --> 37:22.492
Why am I here with him?

37:24.349 --> 37:27.789
We gonna keep some things waiting.
Vaulted ceilings? No way in 30 days.

37:27.909 --> 37:30.293
Great ideas, guys.
Keep them coming.

37:31.301 --> 37:34.365
- What am I doing here?
- I'll tell you. Come here.

37:36.334 --> 37:39.176
I'm used to raising roof.
I'm gonna raise me the ceiling.

37:40.572 --> 37:42.638
- I bought this house.
- What?

37:42.758 --> 37:44.723
I bought this house.
I mean not for us to live in.

37:44.884 --> 37:48.830
We gonna fix it up, and turn it over
in about 30 days, make a lot of money...

37:48.950 --> 37:51.259
This gonna get us a great nesting
to start our life.

37:51.379 --> 37:53.442
Finally, you know, some good money.

37:55.032 --> 37:57.068
It's not quite the reaction
I was hoping for.

37:58.557 --> 38:00.170
I'm moving back East

38:00.950 --> 38:02.352
with my parents.

38:02.914 --> 38:04.004
I have to.

38:04.390 --> 38:06.871
This isn't working.
None of this is working.

38:07.551 --> 38:08.606
It's too hard.

38:08.726 --> 38:11.976
I need to go and make a different plan
and start over.

38:12.096 --> 38:15.170
This is a different plan.
This is a new plan, this is a good plan.

38:15.331 --> 38:17.881
- This is gonna make money!
- Jason, this is crazy.

38:18.983 --> 38:20.752
I don't know what else to do.

38:20.872 --> 38:22.806
I have to go home.
I can't...

38:23.227 --> 38:24.430
I'm sorry.

38:28.739 --> 38:31.061
You can come visit.
He's your son, too. Anytime.

38:32.901 --> 38:36.604
Erin, you can't just
take Noah, and go...

38:38.783 --> 38:40.499
This plan is gonna work.

38:57.855 --> 39:00.427
- What did she say?
- She's excited.

39:01.025 --> 39:03.743
She's really excited.
She's thrilled, she can't...

39:04.147 --> 39:06.817
She can't wait to see
what we do with the place.

39:07.148 --> 39:09.265
We got a lot of work to do.
Come on.

39:31.616 --> 39:32.642
Come here.

39:40.875 --> 39:42.272
What are we doing?

39:45.434 --> 39:48.806
Did I ever tell you that
I almost dropped out of high school?

39:50.237 --> 39:52.856
You almost dropped
out of high school?

39:55.608 --> 39:57.809
I know it's hard to believe, huh?

39:58.128 --> 40:01.463
Your momma was a little bit
of a wild child back in the day.

40:03.341 --> 40:04.897
So, what happened?

40:06.511 --> 40:09.490
What happened was your dad happened.
I mean, your dad...

40:09.610 --> 40:10.823
You know...

40:11.848 --> 40:13.830
He had struggles of his own, too.

40:14.162 --> 40:18.162
But, you know. We were lucky. We just
had each other, always managed to...

40:18.534 --> 40:20.713
pull each other
up by our bootstraps.

40:21.354 --> 40:24.819
But I know how easy
that road is to go down.

40:26.391 --> 40:29.043
And I don't... You know...
I guess when I see

40:29.163 --> 40:32.528
you getting a tattoo,
it's starting making me worry.

40:35.204 --> 40:38.981
And you know you are just...
independent and...

40:39.550 --> 40:41.734
smart and... beautiful

40:41.894 --> 40:45.364
and you're not gonna need any guy
to pull you out of some hole.

40:47.503 --> 40:49.207
But, I feel like...

40:53.332 --> 40:56.306
I feel like I need you to promise me
that that's true.

40:57.957 --> 40:59.473
I promise.

41:00.587 --> 41:02.662
I'm not going down that road.

41:16.478 --> 41:18.094
Alright, let's go home.

41:19.370 --> 41:21.006
So I can keep the tattoo?

41:21.515 --> 41:23.517
Honey, I guarantee you that
by the time you're 30,

41:23.637 --> 41:26.062
you're gonna
take that thing off yourself.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.397
And I'm not gonna pay for it, then.

41:31.621 --> 41:34.120
2%! We don't drink that!
That's wrong!

41:34.280 --> 41:36.121
- Next time...
- We don't use grape jelly!

41:36.520 --> 41:39.929
- We like strawberry jelly.
- I thought everybody liked grape...

41:40.241 --> 41:41.918
No! We don't like grape jelly.

41:42.471 --> 41:46.465
And did you buy any of those cookies
I like, those vanilla creams?

41:47.406 --> 41:49.365
I forgot. I know I meant...

41:49.706 --> 41:52.510
Well listen! Young lady,
if you ever do,

41:52.630 --> 41:54.841
go buy something
that I might wanna eat,

41:54.961 --> 41:56.850
right there is
where I like to keep 'em!

42:02.990 --> 42:05.191
She's pretty serious
about her cookies.

42:12.417 --> 42:13.992
Do you like grape jelly?

42:14.643 --> 42:16.119
Nobody likes grape jelly.

42:24.652 --> 42:26.867
You know, I was wondering
if maybe this Friday

42:26.987 --> 42:29.347
it'd be alright if I went
to one of your games.

42:34.767 --> 42:36.139
But I don't have to go.

42:36.424 --> 42:40.321
- If you'd rather, I'd...
- This might not be the best week, OK?

42:42.247 --> 42:43.247
Why?

42:44.423 --> 42:46.483
You know I play quarterback, right?

42:47.541 --> 42:49.780
I've been starring
since sophomore year.

42:49.900 --> 42:52.751
You know I thought I was doing OK.
We won State.

42:54.753 --> 42:55.753
But...

42:56.399 --> 43:00.028
there is this new freshman this year,
and everyone thinks he's...

43:01.050 --> 43:03.951
the next Peyton Manning
or something, so...

43:05.718 --> 43:07.157
I got replaced.

43:08.636 --> 43:10.926
Oh, Matt. I'm sorry.

43:11.550 --> 43:12.550
It's OK.

43:13.439 --> 43:15.372
Is that why the coach was here?

43:18.758 --> 43:20.483
You don't deserve that.

43:21.568 --> 43:24.542
I didn't really deserve the job
in the first place.

43:26.448 --> 43:29.318
The only reason I ever started
was because...

43:29.720 --> 43:31.757
our quarterback, Jason Street...

43:33.912 --> 43:36.074
he got paralyzed
in the middle of a game.

43:36.696 --> 43:38.019
Oh, my God!

43:40.800 --> 43:42.510
That was pretty horrible.

43:45.859 --> 43:49.121
You know. They needed me
and I stepped up and worked my ass off.

43:49.241 --> 43:51.840
I did everything I could,
you know, but...

43:54.868 --> 43:56.469
I guess this wasn't really enough.

43:57.879 --> 43:59.305
Sounds like you did a great job.

44:01.119 --> 44:02.119
Thanks.

44:04.078 --> 44:07.064
Did you ever think about, maybe,
just taking a break?

44:09.178 --> 44:10.992
I can't quit the team.

44:13.721 --> 44:15.637
What would they do?
Shoot you?

44:16.525 --> 44:17.748
Probably.

44:18.517 --> 44:19.826
We do that in Texas.

44:23.037 --> 44:24.509
You want a cookie?

45:42.209 --> 45:45.037
- Hi. Can I talk to Cash?
- Cash doesn't live here.

45:45.197 --> 45:46.538
When you see Cash,

45:46.698 --> 45:50.125
just tell him he owes Ally and Tucker
$1,600 in child support.

45:53.922 --> 45:56.297
If you accept this kid,
the team is gonna accept him.

45:56.752 --> 45:58.375
I'm asking for your help.

45:58.635 --> 46:00.419
McCoy, get in!

46:01.897 --> 46:03.805
Have a drink, man.
This is a party.
