WEBVTT

00:00.731 --> 00:02.673
OOH. GREAT SHIRT ALERT.

00:02.673 --> 00:05.676
YEAH?
NO. I JUST MADE UP THAT PHRASE
"GREAT SHIRT ALERT,"

00:05.676 --> 00:09.440
AND IT'S REALLY FUN TO SAY.
(chuckles) OH, WELL,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID IT TO ANDY.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.013
I MEAN, COME ON.
GREAT SHIRT ALERT.
YEAH?

00:13.013 --> 00:16.016
NO. I JUST WANTED TO TRY
SAYING IT. JULES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.789
IT'S SO FUN!
I HAVE HAD THE WORST WRITER'S
BLOCK. THIS IS THE ONLY SONG

00:18.789 --> 00:22.123
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH
IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS.

00:22.123 --> 00:24.725
в™Є WRITER'S BLOCK,
WRITER'S BLOCK, WRITER'S в™Є

00:24.725 --> 00:27.158
в™Є WRITER'S, WRITER'S, WRITER'S,
BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK, BLOCK в™Є

00:27.158 --> 00:29.460
(hammering and sawing)
HEAR THAT?

00:29.460 --> 00:31.802
THAT'S WHAT YOUR STUPID SONGS
SOUND LIKE IN MY HEAD!

00:31.802 --> 00:34.265
WHY DO WE STILL
HAVE TO HANG OUT HERE

00:34.265 --> 00:37.368
WHEN YOUR BATHROOM'S
BEING REMODELED?
MY KITCHEN IS OUR HANGOUT.
IT'S--IT'S OUR TURF.

00:37.368 --> 00:40.641
IT'S OUR CLUBHOUSE. OUR...
(rolls tongue) BARRIO.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.314
WHY DID YOU TEACH HER
HOW TO ROLL HER R's?

00:43.314 --> 00:45.816
MOLLY...
(rolls tongue) RINGWALD.

00:45.816 --> 00:47.718
I'M REALLY SORRY.

00:47.718 --> 00:50.151
OH, COME ON.
THE CONSTRUCTION'S NOT THAT BAD.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.654
YOU KNOW,
WE GOT TO MEET GERALD.
THIS HAS BEEN
A GREAT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.258
YOU GUYS REALLY GOT ME
THROUGH SOME STUFF.
WE KNOW YOUR FATHER'S
A TOUGH COOKIE.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.260
BUT JUST REMEMBER,
ALL THAT YELLING IS

00:59.260 --> 01:01.462
JUST HIM SHOWING YOU
HIS LOVE, YOU KNOW?

01:01.462 --> 01:04.365
I DO NOW.
WHO LAYS TILE BETTER THAN YOU?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.397
NO ONE. I CAN DO THIS.

01:06.397 --> 01:08.799
HE'S BACK.
YOU GO, GERALD!

01:08.799 --> 01:12.143
YEAH, YEAH!
YOU DAD WAS WRONG ABOUT YOU!

01:12.143 --> 01:14.145
HIS DAD WAS NOT WRONG,

01:14.145 --> 01:17.148
BUT YOU DO WHAT YOU DO
FOR GOOD TILE, YOU KNOW?

01:17.148 --> 01:19.180
OH, I CAN'T WAIT FOR
THIS BATHROOM TO BE DONE!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.152
IN FACT, PUT IT
IN YOUR CALENDARS,

01:21.152 --> 01:23.454
BECAUSE I'M GONNA HAVE
A BATHROOM-WARMING PARTY.

01:23.454 --> 01:26.457
CAN I BRING SARA TO WHAT SOUNDS
LIKE THE WORST PARTY EVER?

01:26.457 --> 01:29.260
OOH, YOU MEAN SARA,
YOUR NEW GIRLFRIEND?

01:29.260 --> 01:31.262
OOH-OOH-OOH-OOH!(scoffs)

01:31.262 --> 01:33.364
OH, THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.

01:33.364 --> 01:36.597
I-I THOUGHT YOU WERE ALL
GONNA DO IT.
HEY, WHERE DID YOU
EVEN FIND THE SPACE

01:36.597 --> 01:38.829
TO PUT IN
A GIANT MASTER BATHROOM?

01:40.831 --> 01:42.873
BALLS!

01:42.873 --> 01:44.375
I LOVE YOU.

01:44.375 --> 01:47.238
NOT HAPPENING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NOT HAPPENING"?

01:47.238 --> 01:50.241
I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO LOVE YOU?
THAT "I LOVE YOU"
DOESN'T MEAN "I LOVE YOU."

01:50.241 --> 01:53.484
IT MEANS "LET'S HAVE SEX."
IT DOESN'T THIS TIME.
TRUST ME.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.749
I CAN BE QUICK.
YOU BROKE THE TRUST!

01:58.749 --> 02:02.253
LOOK, OUR SEX SCHEDULE IS
ONE AND A HALF TIMES A WEEK.

02:02.253 --> 02:06.126
IT HAS BEEN TEN DAYS
SINCE OUR ONE OR OUR HALF.
OUR HALF? COME ON.
IT'S YOUR HALF.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.129
YEAH, IT IS.
I ADMIT, IT'S BEEN TOO LONG,

02:09.129 --> 02:12.233
BUT I GOT SIDELINED BY
THAT U.T.I. ALL RIGHT, REACT.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.665
(mutters, coughs)

02:14.665 --> 02:17.137
BUT NOW YOU WANT SEX SO BADLY
THAT IT'S TOO MUCH PRESSURE.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.770
IT MAKES ME NOT WANT IT.
SO YOU WANT ME TO NOT WANT IT?

02:19.770 --> 02:22.813
NO, I WANT YOU TO WANT IT, BUT I
DON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU WANT IT.

02:22.813 --> 02:26.317
HOW WILL YOU KNOW I WANT IT?
IF I WANT IT, YOU'LL WANT IT.

02:26.317 --> 02:28.819
TRUE. OKAY.
WE CAN DO THIS.

02:28.819 --> 02:29.820
OKAY.

02:29.820 --> 02:31.682
ALL RIGHT.

02:33.354 --> 02:36.687
JUST GIVE ME MY HALF!

02:36.687 --> 02:38.689
(camera shutter clicks)
HEY, THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

02:38.689 --> 02:41.632
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR SCHOOL
MAKES YOU DO PHOTO PROJECTS.

02:41.632 --> 02:44.395
IT'S LIKE THEY CATER TO
THE WEIRD, ARTSY-FARTSY KIDS.

02:44.395 --> 02:47.368
I STARTED
THE PHOTOGRAPHY CLUB.
COOL.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.540
NICE SAVE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW THIS IS...
(mouths word)

02:49.540 --> 02:51.272
ALL ABOUT STOLEN MOMENTS.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.675
SO YOU JUST GOTTA PRETEND
LIKE I'M NOT HERE.
JUST DO IT, NERD.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
HURTFUL.
OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.781
(woman) в™Є AHH в™Є

03:00.781 --> 03:02.483
в™Є HOT STUFF в™Є

03:02.483 --> 03:04.715
в™Є YOU SUPERSTAR в™Є

03:04.715 --> 03:07.458
SERIOUSLY?
IF THERE'S A CAMERA AROUND,
WE BRING THE SEXY.

03:07.458 --> 03:08.959
IT'S HOW WE DO.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.961
WELL, THE CAMERA WOULD BEG
TO DIFFER.

03:10.961 --> 03:12.693
(Laurie gasps)

03:12.693 --> 03:15.566
IT'S A DEVIL CAMERA!
I'M A SEAL.

03:15.566 --> 03:19.230
NO POSING, OKAY? JUST GO SIT
ON THE BENCH AND TALK.

03:19.230 --> 03:22.233
(camera shutter clicking)
OH, I KNOW.
WHY DON'T WE PLAY THAT GAME

03:22.233 --> 03:25.236
WHERE WE GUESS WHO'S
GONNA DIE FIRST? LAURIE.
LAURIE.

03:25.236 --> 03:27.878
YOU GET DEFIBRILLATED AT
A KID ROCK CONCERT ONE TIME...

03:27.878 --> 03:32.613
WELL...
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GRAYSON
BEING IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP?

03:32.613 --> 03:34.315
I DON'T KNOW.

03:34.315 --> 03:38.589
AND I CAN'T REALLY BE JEALOUS
BECAUSE I NEVER GOT IN THE GAME.

03:38.589 --> 03:41.552
BUT HONESTLY,
IT--IT DOES KINDA SUCK.

03:41.552 --> 03:44.825
(camera shutter clicks)
SHA-BOOM.
A MOMENT HAS BEEN STOLEN.

03:44.825 --> 03:48.299
TRAVIS, LET ME SEE THAT.
I WAS SAD. THAT'S NOT FAIR.

03:48.299 --> 03:51.632
OOH. WHOA. I LOOK HOT
WHEN I'M DEPRESSED.

03:51.632 --> 03:55.005
OH!
THAT'S WHY I ALWAYS GET HIT ON
WHEN I'M AT FUNERALS.

03:55.005 --> 03:56.006
UH-HUH.

03:56.006 --> 03:58.639
AW, WHY CAN'T SOMEONE DIE?

03:58.639 --> 04:01.241
STOP IT.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.944
YOU'RE JULES, RIGHT?

04:03.944 --> 04:05.376
SARA.

04:05.376 --> 04:08.279
OH. HI. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE GRAYSON'S, UH--
I AM.

04:08.279 --> 04:09.880
(chuckles) HAVE A SEAT.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.983
WELL, I'M JUST GONNA DIVE RIGHT
IN. YOU'VE GOT GORGEOUS HAIR.

04:12.983 --> 04:15.686
IT'S LIKE YOU HIT
YOUR HEAD ON A ROCK,

04:15.686 --> 04:19.290
AND HONEY IS POURING OUT.
I JUST HAD IT DONE
FOR YOUR BATHROOM PARTY. TWICE.

04:19.290 --> 04:21.492
OH, I FORGOT.
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

04:21.492 --> 04:23.894
(singsongy) I'M INSANE!
NO WAY! ME, TOO.

04:23.894 --> 04:25.936
(laughs)
HEY, DON'T BE NERVOUS
ABOUT TONIGHT, OKAY?

04:25.936 --> 04:27.838
'CAUSE IT'S TOTALLY CASUAL.

04:27.838 --> 04:30.871
I MEAN, DON'T WEAR JEANS,
'CAUSE WE'RE NOT ANIMALS.
(chuckles) OKAY, THANKS.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.874
OH, I GOTTA RUN. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE AS COOL AS GRAYSON SAID.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.806
OH. PEACE.

04:35.806 --> 04:37.378
PEACE?

04:37.378 --> 04:40.981
WHAT KIND OF A SKANK
WEARS A WATCH?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.754
NICE TRY, LAURIE,
BUT I LIKE HER.

04:43.754 --> 04:45.285
(laughs)

04:45.285 --> 04:47.017
OH, YOU'RE SERIOUS.
YEAH.

04:47.017 --> 04:49.990
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.692
MM!
(Travis) OH. OH.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.694
SHE LET YOU KISS HER
THAT WAY?

04:53.694 --> 04:56.026
YEAH, DAD.
I LICK HER MOUTH.

04:56.026 --> 04:56.997
MMM!

04:56.997 --> 04:59.530
SHA-BAMMY!

04:59.530 --> 05:03.033
(scoffs) I'M MAKING OUT
WITH A DOG. DELETE THAT.
FINE.

05:03.033 --> 05:06.036
(grunts)
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE
SOME NOTES, JUNIOR.

05:06.036 --> 05:09.480
DOG TRAVIS HAS MORE GAME
THAN YOU.
LOOK, I GOT IT COVERED,
ALL RIGHT?

05:09.480 --> 05:13.784
(laughs) TRAVIS!
YOU JUST UNDID MY BRA!

05:13.784 --> 05:15.416
SERIOUSLY?

05:15.416 --> 05:18.749
I'VE GOT GOT HEATED FLOORS,
A STEAM SHOWER,

05:18.749 --> 05:21.752
FLAT SCREEN,
AND CHECK OUT THE TUB.

05:21.752 --> 05:24.725
IT IS SO DEEP I CAN RENT IT OUT
FOR WATER BIRTHS.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.628
(Laurie) WOW, JULES!

05:27.628 --> 05:30.060
IT'S LIKE A BATHROOM
FROM A FAIRY TALE!

05:30.060 --> 05:33.734
I CAN TOTALLY PICTURE A PRINCESS
COPPING A SQUAT IN HERE.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.066
WE'RE IN A BATHROOM.

05:36.066 --> 05:39.740
IS THAT ONE OF THOSE ELECTRONIC
TOILET SEATS FROM JAPAN?
MM-HMM.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.112
HOLY GODS,
IT CLEANS YOUR HOO.

05:42.112 --> 05:44.114
THERE ARE A LOT MORE SETTINGS
TO FIGURE OUT.

05:44.114 --> 05:47.117
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONE BUTTON
THAT JUST SAYS "NO."
OH.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.950
OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO PUSH THAT.
I'LL BET.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.422
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS

05:51.422 --> 05:54.425
THAT SOMETIMES IT YELLS AT ME
IN JAPANESE.
MM.

05:54.425 --> 05:57.758
WOW. BRACE YOURSELVES. GRAYSON'S
ON HIS WAY UP WITH SARA.
OH, HERE WE GO.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.090
WHAT? IS HE BEING
MORE OF A COCKY JERK

06:00.090 --> 06:03.534
NOW THAT HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND?
NO, SORT OF THE OPPOSITE.

06:03.534 --> 06:06.897
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
YEAH, MY LITTLE SARE-BEAR'S
TUMMY WAS GROWLING...

06:06.897 --> 06:09.840
(baby voice)
SO WE GOT A WITTLE NUM-NUM.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.002
A WITTLE
NUM-NUM-NUM-NUM-NUM.

06:12.002 --> 06:15.676
OH, NO.
(normal voice) HERE. LET ME
TAKE YOUR PURSE. (grunts)

06:15.676 --> 06:18.509
WHAT DO YOU GOT IN THERE,
ROCKS?
OH.

06:18.509 --> 06:21.381
I'M KIDDING, YOU.
SHA-MOO.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.955
(camera shutter clicks)

06:24.955 --> 06:27.588
(electronic male voice)
FURASSHU!
(flushes)

06:27.588 --> 06:30.861
OH, THAT MEANS "FLUSH."
YAY!
OH.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.865
в™Єв™Є

06:43.934 --> 06:46.907
HEY, SORRY. I'D LOVE TO STAY,
BUT THE OLD BALL AND CHAIN...

06:46.907 --> 06:49.409
I'M KIDDING. BYE, GUYS.
BYE! SEE YA!

06:49.409 --> 06:51.712
(Laurie) WE'LL MISS YOU!
(laughs)

06:51.712 --> 06:53.113
OH, NO!
OH, MY LORD!

06:53.113 --> 06:54.645
DOWNRIGHT PAINFUL.

06:54.645 --> 06:56.947
DID YOU SEE GRAYSON
JUST STANDING THERE,

06:56.947 --> 06:58.989
HOLDING SARA'S PURSE?

06:58.989 --> 07:01.522
I'VE GOT ONE BETTER THAN
"GREAT SHIRT ALERT."

07:01.522 --> 07:03.824
GRAYSON IS TOTALLY
PURSEY-WHIPPED.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.055
(laughs)
THAT'S GOOD.

07:05.055 --> 07:07.427
THAT IS REALLY
GONNA CATCH ON.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.929
PURSEY MAGNET.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.661
PURSEY HOUND.

07:10.661 --> 07:13.464
PURSEY CAT.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

07:13.464 --> 07:16.607
MAYBE GRAYSON'S
JUST BEING CAREFUL. BECAUSE--

07:16.607 --> 07:19.640
I'M SORRY. I JUST--
I-I REALLY MISS MY BATHROOM.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.743
AHH. YES. CONTINUE.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.775
MAYBE GRAYSON'S
JUST BEING CAREFUL

07:24.775 --> 07:26.917
BECAUSE IT'S
A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

07:26.917 --> 07:29.119
THEY PROBABLY HAVEN'T EVEN
SHAVED EACH OTHER YET.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.752
I NEVER GOT
THIS WHOLE GRAYSON THING,

07:31.752 --> 07:34.054
BUT NOW SEEING HIM
ALL WEAK AND SUBMISSIVE,

07:34.054 --> 07:35.656
IT'S OH, SO HOT.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.689
COME ON. I THINK IT MAKES HIM
SO UNATTRACTIVE.

07:38.689 --> 07:41.091
YEAH. IT'S A TOTAL...
(makes whooshing sound)

07:41.091 --> 07:44.895
WHAT? IT'S THE UNIVERSAL SIGN
FOR LADY TURNOFF.
NO, IT'S--IT'S NOT.

07:44.895 --> 07:47.067
HE'S JUST
GONNA PUSH SARA AWAY.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.070
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?
I DON'T WANNA WATCH
A FRIEND DROWN.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.573
PLUS, I-I LIKE SARA.
SHE WAS SO NICE TO ME

07:52.573 --> 07:54.575
THIS MORNING
WHEN I RAN INTO HER.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.147
(crying)
I'M SORRY I'M CRYING.

07:57.147 --> 08:00.811
YOUR HAIR'S SO MUCH NICER
THAN MINE.
I KNOW. EVERYTHING IS.

08:00.811 --> 08:02.713
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

08:02.713 --> 08:04.685
THAT'S HOW I REMEMBER IT.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.687
WHY ARE YOU
SO INTO PHOTOGRAPHY?

08:06.687 --> 08:07.988
I FEEL LIKE PHOTOS

08:07.988 --> 08:11.592
REALLY CAPTURE
OUR COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUS.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.194
PLUS, BEING PRETENTIOUS
REALLY WORKS ON ME.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.097
YOU SHOULD WORK THAT ANGLE
IN COLLEGE. GET YOURSELF A SCARF

08:17.097 --> 08:20.170
AND WATCH THE NERDY GIRLS START
THROWING THEIR LEGS OPEN.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.702
YEAH, I LOVE KYLIE.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.834
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE
GOING TO DIFFERENT COLLEGES,

08:23.834 --> 08:27.037
I THINK WE'RE
GONNA STAY TOGETHER.
(both laugh)

08:27.037 --> 08:28.238
ARE YOU DONE?

08:28.238 --> 08:31.682
(both) NO. (laughing)

08:37.087 --> 08:40.050
OH! I REALLY DIG THIS ONE
OF KYLIE KISSING THE DOG.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.993
LOOKS LIKE AN OLD PORTUGUESE MAN
AND HIS MISTRESS.

08:42.993 --> 08:46.526
SHE WON'T LET ME USE IT, THOUGH.
I HAD TO PRETEND I DELETED IT.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.060
ART SHOULD NEVER BE COMPROMISED
FOR THE SAKE OF VANITY.
(Jules) Laurie, bring up coffee.

08:50.060 --> 08:53.864
We're working in my bathroom
today.
SHE SLEPT IN THERE
LAST NIGHT.

08:53.864 --> 08:57.007
Honey,
you have a problem.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

08:57.007 --> 08:59.670
ARE YOU PLANNING ON LEAVING
THE BATHROOM TODAY?

08:59.670 --> 09:01.612
NO, NO, NO. NOT--NOT TODAY.

09:01.612 --> 09:04.114
SO ELLIE PULLED
THE WHOLE TO-GET-SEX-MORE-

09:04.114 --> 09:07.147
YOU-HAVE-TO-WANT-IT-LESS THING?
(laughs) CLASSIC.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.780
I CAN'T HANDLE IT, MAN.
I'M NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

09:09.780 --> 09:12.282
CALM DOWN, A-TEAM.
YOU CALM DOWN!

09:12.282 --> 09:14.284
LOOK, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS

09:14.284 --> 09:17.027
JUST PICTURE ELLIE
WITH A BUCKET HEAD.
A BUCKET ON HER HEAD?

09:17.027 --> 09:19.630
NO, THE BUCKET IS HER HEAD.
HOW WOULD THAT HELP?

09:19.630 --> 09:22.062
HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED
INSIDE OF A BUCKET

09:22.062 --> 09:23.964
AND NOT SEEN
SOMETHING DISGUSTING?

09:23.964 --> 09:27.998
FISH GUTS, DIP, SPIT,
DEAD RATS.
THAT'LL WORK.

09:27.998 --> 09:31.001
SORRY I YELLED.
APOLOGY HUG.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.845
(grunts)

09:34.845 --> 09:37.577
ELLIE THINKS
OUR APOLOGY HUGS ARE WEIRD.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.049
SHE'S WEIRD. (grunts)

09:39.049 --> 09:42.082
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.314
STILL HAVING WRITER'S BLOCK?

09:44.314 --> 09:48.088
в™Є TRYING TO BREAK IT
BY SINGING EVERY WORD I SAY в™Є

09:48.088 --> 09:49.589
(bottle clinks)

09:49.589 --> 09:53.023
DAMN IT! I JUST GOT PERFUME
ALL OVER MY CONTRACTS.

09:53.023 --> 09:56.697
THAT'S IT. IF I WANTED TO BE
A BATHROOM ATTENDANT,

09:56.697 --> 09:59.169
I WOULD HAVE STAYED
A BATHROOM ATTENDANT.

09:59.169 --> 10:01.101
GOOD DAY.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.305
SO... в™Є WHY DID
YOU HAVE ME OVER? в™Є
I GRABBED
ONE OF TRAVIS' CAMERAS,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.808
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOME OF THE PICTURES

10:07.808 --> 10:10.811
THAT HE'S BEEN TAKING
OF YOU AND SARA.
OH.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.183
WELL, THERE YOU ARE
SPOON-FEEDING HER ICE CREAM...

10:13.183 --> 10:16.286
(chuckles)
BRUSHING HER GLORIOUS HAIR...

10:16.286 --> 10:18.719
SARE-BEAR.
(beep)

10:18.719 --> 10:21.852
GRAYSON, YOU ARE ACTING
LIKE A TOTAL PURSEY.
A...

10:21.852 --> 10:24.695
(beep)
OKAY, LOOK AT THIS.
YOU'RE PAINTING HER TOENAILS.

10:24.695 --> 10:26.697
WHOA. HOW DID TRAVIS
GET THIS PICTURE?

10:26.697 --> 10:28.198
THAT'S IN MY BEDROOM.

10:28.198 --> 10:31.261
(camera shutter clicking)

10:35.335 --> 10:37.407
(sighs)

10:37.407 --> 10:39.169
YOU ENJOY YOUR SHOWER?

10:39.169 --> 10:40.110
YEAH.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.175
HO HO! YAY! MINE! YES!

10:45.175 --> 10:47.017
(camera shutter snaps)

10:47.017 --> 10:48.949
(singsongy) SHA-BAM.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.121
DAMN IT, ANDY.
FOR ONCE I WAS COMING TO YOU,

10:51.121 --> 10:54.354
AND YOU RUINED IT!
YOUR BUCKET WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
FILLED WITH FISH GUTS,

10:54.354 --> 10:57.357
BUT I LOOKED INSIDE,
AND IT WAS NOTHING BUT SEX.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.430
WHAT?
IT WAS JUST
AN EIGHTH OF A SECOND.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.432
CAN'T WE GET
THAT MOMENT BACK?

11:02.432 --> 11:04.264
(makes whooshing sound)

11:04.264 --> 11:06.196
IT'S ALL-NATURAL LIGHT.

11:06.196 --> 11:08.238
DUDE, A BUCKET HEAD?

11:08.238 --> 11:11.071
REALLY?
AH, I TOOK A SWING.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.403
DON'T HELP ANYMORE.
WHAT YOU GUYS LOOKING AT?

11:13.403 --> 11:17.377
I PRESENT TO YOU THE CROWN JEWEL
OF STOLEN MOMENTS.
(chuckles)

11:17.377 --> 11:19.179
ME BUTT-NAKED.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.212
LET ME SEE THAT, 'CAUSE I'M
GONNA SMASH YOUR CAMERA.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:22.212 --> 11:23.854
GIVE IT!
OH!

11:23.854 --> 11:26.917
OH, CHILL, EL.
I'VE SEEN YOU NUDE.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.920
MAN, I VIDEOTAPED THE BIRTH OF
YOUR CHILD, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.063
AT LEAST HERE YOU'RE NOT
ALL, YOU KNOW, INSIDE OUT.
NO ONE'S SEEING THAT PICTURE.

11:33.063 --> 11:35.065
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE STUFF
YOU SAID

11:35.065 --> 11:37.728
ABOUT ART BEING MORE IMPORTANT
THAN VANITY?

11:37.728 --> 11:39.730
OH, NO.
HOW WILL I SLEEP AT NIGHT?

11:39.730 --> 11:41.772
OH, RIGHT.
I HAVE PILLS FOR THAT.

11:41.772 --> 11:44.404
ARE YOU REALLY CRITICIZING ME
FOR TAKING CARE

11:44.404 --> 11:46.977
OF MY GIRLFRIEND?
в™Є I AM в™Є

11:46.977 --> 11:51.241
OKAY, I HATE MYSELF, BUT YOU
SEE HOW ANNOYING THAT IS?
I'M FINALLY IN
A REAL RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.

11:51.241 --> 11:53.243
I'M TRYING
TO REALLY BE IN IT.

11:53.243 --> 11:56.246
OKAY? HELL, YOU'VE BEEN ON ME
SINCE THE DAY WE MET

11:56.246 --> 11:59.790
TO BE MORE OPEN
AND EMOTIONALLY AVAILABLE.
BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO BECOME A LADY BUTLER.

11:59.790 --> 12:02.152
I'M NOT A LADY BUTLER.
YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT.

12:02.152 --> 12:04.154
BECAUSE I'VE MET
A LADY BUTLER BEFORE,

12:04.154 --> 12:07.027
AND SEE, UM,
THEY DON'T TALK BABY TALK.

12:07.027 --> 12:09.199
(baby voice) OH, SARE-BEAR,
I WUV YOU SO MUCH.

12:09.199 --> 12:11.161
IT'S LIKE I DON'T HAVE
TEETH NO MO'.

12:11.161 --> 12:13.133
SARA LOVES
THAT I'M SO INTO HER.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.406
(normal voice) NO, SHE DOESN'T.
IF YOU KEEP IT UP, YOU WATCH.

12:16.406 --> 12:19.209
SHE'S GONNA SAY SHE NEEDS SPACE
AND SHE'LL START PULLING AWAY.

12:19.209 --> 12:22.172
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
(electronic male voice)
FURASSHU.

12:22.172 --> 12:25.045
SHUT UP!
DON'T YOU YELL AT MY TOILET.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.048
LOOK, I'M SORRY THAT I FOUND
SOMEONE THAT I CARE ABOUT.

12:28.048 --> 12:30.350
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WOULD
MAKE YOU SO JEALOUS.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.352
I'M NOT JEALOUS.
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

12:32.352 --> 12:37.057
I MAY NOT BE EXPRESSING IT WITH
MY TONE RIGHT NOW, BUT I AM.

12:37.057 --> 12:40.130
IF ANYBODY'S JEALOUS, YOU'RE
JEALOUS OF ME AND MY BATHROOM.

12:40.130 --> 12:42.933
SO YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY INSANE,

12:42.933 --> 12:44.234
SO I'LL JUST SAY...

12:44.234 --> 12:47.267
BACK.. THE HELL... OFF.

12:49.499 --> 12:52.172
(melancholy tone plays)
(electronic male voice
speaks indistinctly)

12:52.172 --> 12:53.944
YOU SAID IT.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.511
CAN YOU BELIEVE GRAYSON?

13:01.511 --> 13:03.213
JEALOUS? I'M NOT JEALOUS.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.215
YOU ARE A LITTLE JEALOUS.

13:05.215 --> 13:07.257
I KNOW.
BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

13:07.257 --> 13:09.119
THIS IS WHERE YOUR FAMILY
HANGS OUT NOW?

13:09.119 --> 13:12.322
YEP. GET COMFORTABLE.
(chuckles)

13:12.322 --> 13:14.394
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:14.394 --> 13:18.268
WE DON'T TOUCH THE TOWELS
IN THE SPECIAL BATHROOM.
(whispers) YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

13:18.268 --> 13:21.201
OH, SORRY.
JUST DON'T DO IT AGAIN.
(chuckles)

13:21.201 --> 13:23.203
MAYBE WITH GRAYSON AND SARA,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.275
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO,
YOU KNOW,

13:25.275 --> 13:27.437
NOT BUTT IN.

13:27.437 --> 13:29.139
YES, I MEDDLE,

13:29.139 --> 13:31.912
BUT I DO IT BECAUSE I KNOW
ULTIMATELY, YOU'RE ALL GRATEFUL.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.514
WE ARE?
YOU--YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.516
YES. YOU LOVE IT
THAT I CARE SO MUCH.

13:36.516 --> 13:40.050
I MEAN, IF TRAVIS KNEW I WAS
DOING IT, HE'D PROBABLY THANK ME

13:40.050 --> 13:43.823
FOR TRIMMING HIS HAIR
WHILE HE'S SLEEPING.
I KNEW IT. YOU KNOW
I WANT TO GROW IT OUT.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.126
SWEETIE, IT HIDES
YOUR PRETTY FACE.

13:46.126 --> 13:50.260
KYLIE! GET YOUR GRUBBY PAWS
OFF MY TOWELS.
SHE WAS PRETTY CLEAR
THE FIRST TIME.

13:50.260 --> 13:52.232
FINE.
YOU WANT ME TO BACK OFF?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.234
OKAY, THEN GUESS WHAT.
I'M OUT.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.436
I WILL NEVER MEDDLE
IN YOUR LIVES AGAIN.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.069
(laughing)

13:59.069 --> 14:00.570
(laughs)

14:00.570 --> 14:03.113
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'LL SEE.
EVERYBODY, GO.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.845
GET OUT. I'M GONNA PRESS
MR. TOILET MAN'S "NO" BUTTON.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.217
GO.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.149
HEY, UH, MRS. TORRES?

14:09.149 --> 14:10.620
(liquid splashing)

14:10.620 --> 14:13.283
(Jules) NO!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME?!

14:13.283 --> 14:15.285
WILL YOU PLEASE CHANGE YOUR MIND

14:15.285 --> 14:18.158
ABOUT LETTING ME
USE YOUR PICTURE?
NO CHANCE, LANCE.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.160
(sighs) CAN YOU BELIEVE HER?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.893
TRAVIS,
YOU'RE SUCH AN ASS.

14:22.893 --> 14:24.334
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

14:24.334 --> 14:26.636
(door opens and closes)

14:26.636 --> 14:29.139
NEVER PRESS
THE "NO" BUTTON.

14:29.139 --> 14:31.241
(grunts)

14:31.241 --> 14:32.903
SORRY IT DIDN'T WORK.

14:32.903 --> 14:35.605
APOLOGY HUG ACCEPTED. (grunts)
(grunts)

14:35.605 --> 14:37.607
SO ELLIE JUST DROPPED ROBE,

14:37.607 --> 14:39.879
AND THE BUCKET HEAD
JUST DISAPPEARED, HUH?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.052
(sighs) THE BUCKET
DIDN'T DISAPPEAR.

14:42.052 --> 14:45.485
I'M SORRY, MY HOT NAKED WIFE
WITH A BUCKET HEAD? I'M IN.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.487
YOU JUST NEED
TO GET TO A PLACE

14:47.487 --> 14:50.160
WHERE THERE'S NO SEXUAL DESIRE
LEFT WHATSOEVER.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.122
I CAN PROBABLY DO THAT

14:52.122 --> 14:55.625
IF I SPENT A LITTLE PRIVATE TIME
WITH... YOU KNOW, MYSELF.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.298
HEY, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MAKING SHOWER BABIES.

14:58.298 --> 15:01.901
ALL RIGHT, IT'S NOT A SIN
IF YOU'RE DOING IT FOR LOVE.
(mutters)

15:01.901 --> 15:03.233
FOR LOVE.

15:03.233 --> 15:06.236
FOR LOVE!

15:06.236 --> 15:08.238
IT'S GREAT OF YOU
TO HAVE ME OVER.

15:08.238 --> 15:09.579
I'VE MISSED OUR TALKS.

15:09.579 --> 15:12.212
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU GET ME.
MORE PINOT?

15:12.212 --> 15:15.085
BRING IT. SO MY DAD AND I
WENT TO COUNSELING TOGETHER.

15:15.085 --> 15:17.447
NOW DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD TRY--
LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT THERE,
GERALD.

15:17.447 --> 15:19.149
I'M DONE WITH MEDDLING.

15:19.149 --> 15:22.592
I STUCK MY NOSE IN MY FRIEND'S
BUSINESS, AND I HURT HIM.

15:22.592 --> 15:25.295
I PROBABLY WASN'T EVEN RIGHT
ABOUT IT ANYWAY.

15:25.295 --> 15:28.298
(man speaking indistinctly
on TV)
HEY. I FIGURED
YOUR FOOTSIES WERE COLD,

15:28.298 --> 15:30.300
SO I WARMED UP YOUR SOCKS
IN THE DRYER.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.462
(turns off TV)
OH, COME ON, SWEETIE.

15:32.462 --> 15:35.265
YOU GOTTA PUSH.
IT'S A 2-PERSON EFFORT.

15:35.265 --> 15:36.236
(chuckles)

15:36.236 --> 15:38.208
UM, THANKS.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.210
YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING

15:40.210 --> 15:42.572
MAYBE I JUST MIGHT CRASH
AT MY PLACE TONIGHT,

15:42.572 --> 15:45.075
JUST GET A LITTLE SPACE.

15:45.075 --> 15:46.476
OH. YEAH.

15:46.476 --> 15:48.378
THAT'S COOL.

15:48.378 --> 15:52.082
I JUST NEED TO LET PEOPLE BE.
JULES, YOU HAVE A GIFT,

15:52.082 --> 15:55.125
AND THAT GIFT IS HELPING PEOPLE.
YOU DID IT FOR ME.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.387
LAST NIGHT, MY DAD AND I
HUGGED FOR THE FIRST TIME.

15:57.387 --> 16:00.590
WAS IT AS BEAUTIFUL
AS IT WAS IN MY DREAMS?

16:00.590 --> 16:03.994
TAKE A GUESS. YOU NEED
TO GET BACK TO BUTTIN' IN.

16:03.994 --> 16:07.497
WHAT IF PEOPLE NEVER REALIZE
HOW MUCH I HELP THEM?
THAT'S THE BURDEN
OF BEING A HERO.

16:07.497 --> 16:09.569
I'M LIKE BATMAN.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.242
(chuckles)
THANK YOU, GERALD.

16:12.242 --> 16:15.645
NO, THANK YOU. NOT MANY CLIENTS
INVITE ME BACK JUST TO TALK.

16:15.645 --> 16:17.347
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

16:17.347 --> 16:19.379
SEE, UM, THERE'S
A FEW TILES OVER THERE

16:19.379 --> 16:22.212
THAT ARE
JUST A LITTLE UNEVEN.

16:22.212 --> 16:24.514
OH, NO. MY DAD WAS RIGHT.
I'M USELESS.

16:24.514 --> 16:27.317
NO. IT'S MY FAULT.
HOW COULD IT BE YOUR FAULT?

16:27.317 --> 16:30.490
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST FIX IT, GERALD.
GOT IT.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.462
WHY IS KYLIE SO MAD?

16:32.462 --> 16:35.465
COULD BE NOTHING. COULD BE THAT
SHE'S PRETENDING TO BE ANGRY

16:35.465 --> 16:37.467
SO SHE DOESN'T FEEL
SO GUILTY

16:37.467 --> 16:40.330
ABOUT BEING KNOCKED UP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S KID.
THAT'S COMFORTING.

16:40.330 --> 16:43.473
SHE'S MAD 'CAUSE YOU FOUGHT
TO USE MY PHOTO, NOT HERS.

16:43.473 --> 16:46.005
WOMEN DO LOVE
WHEN MEN FIGHT FOR THEM.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.138
THERE IS NOTHING LESS SEXY

16:48.138 --> 16:51.281
THAN A DUDE WHO RESPECTS
A RESTRAINING ORDER. UGH.
THAT'S A GREAT STORY.

16:51.281 --> 16:53.343
LOOK, TRAV,
IT'S ALL ABOUT EFFORT.

16:53.343 --> 16:57.347
THERE IS NO END TO WHAT A MAN
MUST DO FOR A WOMAN.

16:57.347 --> 16:59.349
(Spanish accent)
HEY THERE, BABY.

16:59.349 --> 17:02.422
(lighter clicks)

17:02.422 --> 17:05.695
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE FROM AROUND HERE.

17:05.695 --> 17:08.798
ARE YOU LOST, ELLIE TORRES?

17:08.798 --> 17:10.700
HEY.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.202
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:12.202 --> 17:13.703
DON'T BE RUDE.

17:13.703 --> 17:17.107
I LEFT MY BATHROOM TO COME OVER
HERE, AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL.

17:17.107 --> 17:20.270
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.
SHE ASKED FOR SPACE.
I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE RIGHT.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.442
REALLY?
NO, I-I KNEW I WOULD BE..

17:22.442 --> 17:24.244
WELL, GO AHEAD.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.615
GLOAT.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.077
LATER.

17:27.077 --> 17:29.179
NOW I'M HERE TO APOLOGIZE.

17:29.179 --> 17:31.321
SCOOT IT.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.083
SEE...

17:33.083 --> 17:35.054
WHEN YOU ACT LIKE A PURSEY,

17:35.054 --> 17:37.087
YOU ARE JUST SO NOT SEXY.

17:37.087 --> 17:38.228
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

17:38.228 --> 17:41.331
I-I WANT YOU TO BE
THAT EDGY, ALOOF GUY

17:41.331 --> 17:44.294
THAT I-I-I KIND OF FIND
ATTRACTIVE.

17:44.294 --> 17:47.297
BUT THAT'S NOT FOR YOU,
AND IT'S NOT FOR SARA.

17:47.297 --> 17:49.569
THAT'S JUST FOR ME, AND...

17:49.569 --> 17:51.201
SORRY.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.804
(whispers) I'M BATMAN.
(chuckles)

17:54.804 --> 17:58.478
(chuckles)
HOW CAN I STILL NOT UNDERSTAND
WHAT WOMEN WANT?

17:58.478 --> 18:01.781
WOMEN JUST WANT A GUY
WHO RESPECTS OUR INDEPENDENCE

18:01.781 --> 18:04.314
BUT ALSO WANTS
TO TAKE CARE OF US.

18:04.314 --> 18:07.357
WE WANT A GUY WHO'S SECURE
BUT ALSO GETS JEALOUS.

18:07.357 --> 18:09.619
WE WANT A GUY
WHO TRULY LISTENS TO US

18:09.619 --> 18:12.462
BUT ALSO WANTS US
TO KINDA SHUT UP.

18:12.462 --> 18:15.525
LIKE YESTERDAY, WHEN YOU WERE
BEING A LITTLE MEAN TO ME,

18:15.525 --> 18:17.597
BUT YOU WEREN'T
BEING TOO MEAN?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.499
THAT WAS SO HOT.

18:23.273 --> 18:26.276
WELL, I KNOW YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW TO FIX IT WITH SARA,

18:26.276 --> 18:28.308
SO GO AHEAD.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.312
IT'S EASY. JUST TREAT HER
LIKE YOU TREAT ME.

18:32.312 --> 18:35.285
OH, I'M SORRY,
MR. SAD PANTS.
