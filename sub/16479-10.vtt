WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:02.759
JESS: What a Halloween!
Whoa!

00:02.761 --> 00:04.428
Whoa!
Yes! Marcia Clark

00:04.430 --> 00:06.730
cleaned that party out.

00:06.732 --> 00:08.432
I can't believe
nobody got our costumes.

00:08.434 --> 00:09.967
I know.
I'm not Shapiro.

00:09.969 --> 00:13.270
I'm very clearly
Travolta<i> playing</i> Shapiro.

00:13.272 --> 00:14.671
Where-where is the...
Where did the Juice go?

00:14.673 --> 00:15.839
Is he back on the freeway?

00:15.841 --> 00:18.775
Three, two, one.
Midnight, November 1.

00:18.777 --> 00:20.777
Merry Christmas season.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.279
Mm.
Okay.

00:22.281 --> 00:23.280
(whistles)
(muttering)

00:23.282 --> 00:24.414
NICK:
Uh, Jess,

00:24.416 --> 00:26.149
Winston has something
he would like to tell you.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.250
Oh!
Go ahead, Winston.

00:27.252 --> 00:28.752
What? Oh, yeah,
yeah, from...

00:28.754 --> 00:31.455
We did rock-paper-scissors.
Okay.

00:31.457 --> 00:32.456
Well, you know,

00:32.458 --> 00:33.757
well, we were all thinking,

00:33.759 --> 00:35.926
and we were all
on the same page.

00:35.928 --> 00:37.127
We were thinking

00:37.129 --> 00:41.231
that maybe
we don't do Christmas this year.

00:43.635 --> 00:45.802
You know, that would be

00:45.804 --> 00:49.806
a great seminar topic in a

00:49.808 --> 00:51.842
school for demons!

00:51.844 --> 00:52.809
Backup. I need
backup. Your turn.

00:52.811 --> 00:53.944
Well, Jess, Christmas is just

00:53.946 --> 00:56.313
so stressful with the lists

00:56.315 --> 00:58.315
and the lines
and-and the dancing girls

00:58.317 --> 00:59.983
at TV Town Song Room.

00:59.985 --> 01:01.952
TV Town Song Room?

01:01.954 --> 01:03.787
Do you mean
Radio City Music Hall?
Yeah.

01:03.789 --> 01:06.056
How could you get
so many things wrong in a row?

01:06.058 --> 01:07.491
At Radio City
Music's Hall.

01:07.493 --> 01:08.825
What is going on here?

01:08.827 --> 01:10.994
Christmas isn't stressful.

01:10.996 --> 01:12.029
Babe.
Babe.
CECE: You get

01:12.031 --> 01:13.363
more stressed out by Christmas

01:13.365 --> 01:14.798
than anyone I know.

01:14.800 --> 01:18.368
The spirit of Christmas.

01:19.338 --> 01:21.371
(electrical hissing,
booming clack)

01:21.373 --> 01:23.306
Son of a whore!

01:23.308 --> 01:25.175
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
(yelling)

01:25.177 --> 01:28.245
In my defense,
I hadn't slept for six days.

01:28.247 --> 01:30.013
But I do see
your point.

01:30.015 --> 01:31.248
Okay. Great.
Hmm.

01:31.250 --> 01:33.216
So it's official.
Christmas is canceled.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.185
No, Christmas
is not canceled.

01:35.187 --> 01:37.554
Christmas gifts are how
you show the people you love

01:37.556 --> 01:39.389
that you care
in a very special, magical

01:39.391 --> 01:41.658
and highly mandatory way.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.560
You want me to shop until I
drop, and I don't want to drop.

01:43.562 --> 01:44.728
How about this?

01:44.730 --> 01:47.364
One special gift, one person,

01:47.366 --> 01:50.534
and a guessing game at the end.
Secret Santa!

01:50.536 --> 01:52.536
One moment, please.
(Jess sighs)

01:52.538 --> 01:54.438
(whispering)

01:54.440 --> 01:56.373
It's the perfect compromise.
Come on.

01:56.375 --> 01:58.341
(whispering)

01:59.678 --> 02:00.944
General agreement.
NICK:
General agreement.

02:00.946 --> 02:02.779
Sure.
We can do that.
We can do it.

02:02.781 --> 02:05.115
Yes! It's a deal. Okay.

02:05.117 --> 02:06.516
(Nick screaming)

02:06.518 --> 02:07.717
(laughing):
Whoa. Whoa.

02:07.719 --> 02:09.252
Oh.
It's just me.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.921
I'm feeling really good.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.756
¶ ¶

02:16.628 --> 02:18.628
Merry Christmas Eve Eve,
everybody!

02:18.630 --> 02:23.133
Secret Santa starts tonight at
6:00 p.m., aka 7:00 p.m. eve.

02:23.135 --> 02:24.634
Snacks will be potluck.

02:24.636 --> 02:25.902
I call baba ghanoush.

02:25.904 --> 02:27.137
It brings back
such good memories.

02:27.139 --> 02:29.372
My dad waking me up
with hot cocoa,

02:29.374 --> 02:33.076
my dog Frank dressed up
as Rudolph,

02:33.078 --> 02:34.411
looking out the window,

02:34.413 --> 02:36.146
watching for snow,

02:36.148 --> 02:37.714
dancing around
the Christmas tree

02:37.716 --> 02:38.748
to the sweet sounds

02:38.750 --> 02:40.083
of Darlene Love's

02:40.085 --> 02:41.718
"Christmas
(Baby Please Come Home)."

02:41.720 --> 02:42.953
Darlene what now?

02:42.955 --> 02:45.088
¶ The snow's coming down ¶

02:45.090 --> 02:46.456
Love me some Darlene.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.959
¶ I'm watching it fall... ¶

02:48.961 --> 02:50.460
What am<i> I</i> watching now?

02:50.462 --> 02:53.263
Two kilos of uncut joy.
Little reminder--

02:53.265 --> 02:55.632
uh, tonight is
for Secret Santa gifts only.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.234
So, married people,

02:57.236 --> 02:59.903
please exchange your gifts
at another time.
CECE:
Oh, don't worry.

02:59.905 --> 03:02.472
Schmidt and I aren't getting
each other gifts this year.
Uh-uh.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.474
Is that 'cause of
the Jew thing?
Jew thing?

03:04.476 --> 03:07.244
That's just a phrase that falls
out of your mouth these days.

03:08.180 --> 03:10.113
Oh, sorry.

03:10.115 --> 03:13.617
I-I took the last
Jew thing.

03:13.619 --> 03:15.919
This will be the only gift that
Cece is getting this Christmas,

03:15.921 --> 03:18.655
so whoever has her,
please step it up.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.857
CECE: Right, and the
same goes for my man.

03:20.859 --> 03:23.260
Just because he doesn't believe
in the Lord doesn't mean

03:23.262 --> 03:25.629
he can't have cake
at the birthday party.

03:25.631 --> 03:28.632
So, whoever has him
better bring it

03:28.634 --> 03:31.768
because I know
I got the perfect gift for...

03:31.770 --> 03:32.969
JESS:
Up-bup-bup-bup!

03:32.971 --> 03:34.538
<i> Secret</i> Santa.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.805
Also, to that point,

03:35.807 --> 03:37.807
we're all in danger
of revealing ourselves

03:37.809 --> 03:40.644
through little clues such as...

03:40.646 --> 03:42.846
cave man wrapping skills.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.714
I got mozzarella sticks
for fingers.

03:44.716 --> 03:46.683
You're making this
very stressful, Jess.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.186
No, it's not, because
we have a Secret Santa helper,

03:49.188 --> 03:50.287
and his name is...

03:50.289 --> 03:52.455
Robby!
Whoa!
Oh.
Oh.

03:52.457 --> 03:53.657
How long you been
out there, man?

03:53.659 --> 03:55.525
Eh, long enough
to make it weird.

03:55.527 --> 03:56.893
But I could hear
everything, though, so...

03:56.895 --> 03:58.895
Sorry about the wait.
Oh, it's okay.

03:58.897 --> 04:01.164
I slept in a
little bit.
(laughs)

04:01.166 --> 04:03.333
Robby is going to wrap
and label all of your gifts

04:03.335 --> 04:04.901
to ensure anonymity.

04:04.903 --> 04:06.303
I'm just gonna go wait
in Jess' room.

04:06.305 --> 04:07.737
I look forward to working
with you all.

04:07.739 --> 04:09.005
I got to get back to work.

04:09.007 --> 04:11.374
I told the entire staff
they can have three days off

04:11.376 --> 04:13.376
'cause Christmas is usually dead
at the bar.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.313
So, it's just gonna be me
and the receipts.
SCHMIDT: You haven't

04:16.315 --> 04:18.715
done those yet? Nick,
our accountant needs them today.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.183
Yeah, I know.
It's the<i> do</i> date,

04:20.185 --> 04:22.018
so, I'm going to do them today.

04:22.020 --> 04:23.253
D-U-E, Nicholas.

04:23.255 --> 04:27.591
D-O-I-N-G-I-N-G.
<i> Doing.</i> The doing date.

04:27.593 --> 04:31.528
And if you think about it,
D-O-I-N-G shouldn't be doing.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.530
It should be freaking "doyng."

04:33.532 --> 04:36.333
(laughing)
Nick, you got 'em?!

04:36.335 --> 04:38.101
You look like you should be
paying child support in Florida.

04:41.673 --> 04:43.873
I get Nick the perfect gift,

04:43.875 --> 04:46.042
and then he goes
and buys it for himself.

04:46.044 --> 04:47.911
What am I supposed
to get him now?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.412
You could get Nick
some tap shoes, right?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.714
They do make walking fun.
(scoffs)

04:50.716 --> 04:53.383
I told you that
about tap shoes, you tree.

04:53.385 --> 04:55.018
Now think, Jessica.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.853
You're the greatest gift-giver
of all time.

04:57.789 --> 04:59.456
(gasps)
I've got it.

04:59.458 --> 05:01.458
Whatever it is,
I got it covered.

05:01.460 --> 05:02.626
Oh, no, Robby.

05:02.628 --> 05:04.628
What I'm giving him
cannot be wrapped.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.096
Is it a memory?

05:06.098 --> 05:08.298
No.
Ah.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.967
A house?
No.

05:15.374 --> 05:17.274
Damn it, man, false alarm.

05:17.276 --> 05:19.242
I thought that was the mailman
with my Secret Santa gift.

05:19.244 --> 05:20.543
Yes, I know, Winston.

05:20.545 --> 05:22.912
You've run in here at least
six times. You know,

05:22.914 --> 05:25.315
now you can just
<i>track</i> the package.
I can?

05:25.317 --> 05:26.616
Yes.

05:26.618 --> 05:31.121
Let's see.
KXHD136.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.555
You memorized
the package tracking number,

05:32.557 --> 05:34.891
but you didn't know
that you could use that number

05:34.893 --> 05:37.127
to track the package?
What?!

05:37.129 --> 05:40.463
9:18 a.m. refused delivery?

05:40.465 --> 05:42.399
Did you refuse a package

05:42.401 --> 05:45.468
to Retired Rear Admiral
Jay Garage-A-Roo?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.971
Listen to what you just asked.
Of course I did.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.639
Damn it!

05:49.641 --> 05:51.274
Damn it! Damn it!
Damn it! Damn it!

05:51.276 --> 05:52.776
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

05:52.778 --> 05:54.978
Damn it, Schmidt!<i> I</i>

05:54.980 --> 05:57.314
am Retired Rear Admiral
Jay Garage-A-Roo!

05:57.316 --> 05:59.482
It is my Secret
Santa alias. Yeah.
Oh.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.185
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn
it! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

06:02.187 --> 06:03.787
I don't have a gift
for tonight now.

06:03.789 --> 06:05.422
Well, this is not
my problem, Winston.

06:05.424 --> 06:08.024
Oh, no, it<i> is</i> your problem.
Oh, you had me?

06:08.026 --> 06:10.860
I did not have Jess, I did not
have Nick, I do not have you.

06:10.862 --> 06:15.999
It's fairly obvious
who I<i> do</i> have.

06:18.870 --> 06:21.471
I figured it out.
You have Cece.
Oh.

06:21.473 --> 06:23.440
My Cece. My Cece
can't go gift-less.

06:23.442 --> 06:25.542
I like to think of
her as<i> our</i> Cece.

06:25.544 --> 06:28.511
You screwed the pooch
on this one, Winston.
Me? I didn't screw the pooch.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.979
Yes, you did.
You didn't sign for it!

06:29.981 --> 06:32.315
How was I supposed to sign
for Garage-A-Roo's package?

06:32.317 --> 06:34.150
You and your dang old aliases.

06:34.152 --> 06:36.219
You have a new alias
every day, Winston.

06:36.221 --> 06:37.954
Yes, but you should
know it's me!
Garage-A-Roo, Kenneth.

06:37.956 --> 06:40.490
But it was me clearly!
Kenneth, Kenneth.

06:40.492 --> 06:42.959
Rick Smits, Big Poppy Jones.

06:42.961 --> 06:44.694
These are the dumbest names
I've ever heard!

06:44.696 --> 06:46.663
Pontius Pilate.
AKA Idiot.

06:46.665 --> 06:48.365
Maybe that truck is still
in the neighborhood.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.300
Let's go out
and try and get it.
Wait!

06:50.302 --> 06:54.838
This just became a Schmidt and
a Jay Garage-A-Roo mess-around.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.506
Freakin' Jay Garage-A-Roo.
(laughs)

06:56.508 --> 06:59.309
So I fly you down.
You are my gift to Nick.

06:59.311 --> 07:00.143
What do you say?

07:00.145 --> 07:01.311
I don't know, Jess.

07:01.313 --> 07:03.580
I mean, I have
a really big pitch tomorrow.

07:03.582 --> 07:04.981
It's a treatment for...

07:04.983 --> 07:08.585
I mean, the polite term
is "gravelly bowel syndrome."

07:08.587 --> 07:10.320
So fly down for one night.

07:10.322 --> 07:11.988
What could be more romantic

07:11.990 --> 07:13.556
or magical?

07:13.558 --> 07:14.991
I will orchestrate
the whole surprise.

07:14.993 --> 07:16.326
Lighting, blocking,

07:16.328 --> 07:17.394
costumes...
Okay, you know what?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.895
I... I'm in.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.730
You are? I thought
I was gonna have to give you

07:20.732 --> 07:22.365
the hard sell.
That's part of the reason

07:22.367 --> 07:23.366
why I'm in. But...

07:23.368 --> 07:24.701
also, I haven't seen Nick

07:24.703 --> 07:26.770
in a couple weeks,
and I really miss his nonsense.

07:26.772 --> 07:28.671
And that ass-- am I right?

07:28.673 --> 07:29.873
She's in!

07:29.875 --> 07:31.040
Whoo!

07:31.042 --> 07:33.410
ROBBY: Pope Francis,
we have a miracle worker.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.479
The only thing
left to do is...

07:37.416 --> 07:38.948
Hey, Nick.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.518
I, um, just am doing
a little laundry.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.254
I got just enough room
for your bedsheets.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.955
May I do the honors?

07:45.957 --> 07:47.957
But don't touch them--
they're exactly how I like them.

07:47.959 --> 07:51.227
But I'm really glad you called.
The bar is an absolute zoo.

07:51.229 --> 07:53.029
I haven't even gotten
to the receipts yet.

07:53.031 --> 07:53.897
Wait, what?

07:53.899 --> 07:55.098
The point is, I'm swamped,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.599
and I'm not gonna make it
for Secret Santa.

07:56.601 --> 07:57.534
What?
I'm sorry.

07:57.536 --> 07:59.402
I'm just not gonna make it.

07:59.404 --> 08:01.204
Jess, Nick is still gonna
enjoy seeing Reagan,

08:01.206 --> 08:03.807
even if it means she's
just gonna hang out
with him at the bar.

08:03.809 --> 08:05.608
Yeah, it's the thought
that counts.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.911
Yeah.
If you're
in the lump of coal business!

08:07.913 --> 08:09.279
I have to go help Nick

08:09.281 --> 08:11.714
so he can be here
for the surprise.

08:11.716 --> 08:13.049
Did you get...
No, you don't have a drink.

08:13.051 --> 08:14.083
What do you want, a beer?

08:14.085 --> 08:15.552
I'll get you
in a second there, buddy.

08:15.554 --> 08:17.387
Weirdly, this is
not the first time

08:17.389 --> 08:18.922
Nick has failed
to mention elves

08:18.924 --> 08:20.457
in a crisis situation.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.292
CECE:
This is way worse

08:22.294 --> 08:23.893
than you said.

08:23.895 --> 08:25.929
I'm out of here--
it's my day off, and...

08:25.931 --> 08:28.164
You know what, actually,
I don't need more than that.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.599
Wait, wait, no.
Cece, I need your help.

08:29.601 --> 08:30.600
I need your help.

08:30.602 --> 08:32.836
We have to get Nick home
for Secret Santa.

08:32.838 --> 08:34.838
Ooh, you have him.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.773
Yes, I got Nick.
I got Nick.

08:36.775 --> 08:38.174
Reagan's flying out
from Seattle.

08:38.176 --> 08:39.476
Oh...

08:39.478 --> 08:41.644
And we're double-teaming him.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.847
Okay, listen to me
very carefully, okay?

08:43.849 --> 08:45.949
You mean "tag-teaming."

08:45.951 --> 08:47.283
This is
the exact same thing

08:47.285 --> 08:49.586
that happened when you handed
that checkout guy coupons

08:49.588 --> 08:51.621
and said that
we'd been scissoring all day.

08:51.623 --> 08:54.591
Oh. He helped us with our bags.
He was such a gentleman.

08:54.593 --> 08:56.759
No, he was not.

08:56.761 --> 08:58.461
Hey, what are you two
doing here?
What are all

08:58.463 --> 09:01.264
these elves doing here?
They just got off a shift
at the mall.

09:01.266 --> 09:04.334
You know, I've been thinking,
since they're all regular size,

09:04.336 --> 09:07.003
my theory is
it's a mall for giants.
Let us help.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.172
We'll man the bar.
You can hit the receipts.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.040
Ah, it'll be fine.
Someone just has to give

09:11.042 --> 09:12.509
my Secret Santa gift.
It's for...

09:12.511 --> 09:14.677
No! Sorry.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.146
Look, I know you don't
love Secret Santa, but...

09:17.148 --> 09:19.282
don't be alone on
Christmas Eve Eve.

09:19.284 --> 09:21.217
Be with the people you love.

09:22.954 --> 09:24.554
All right, you're right.

09:24.556 --> 09:25.788
I'll take the help.

09:25.790 --> 09:28.458
Uh, time for the receipts,
I guess.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.260
Let me go grab my calculator.

09:32.130 --> 09:34.697
(groans)
We have a lot of work to do.

09:35.834 --> 09:37.500
One, two,

09:37.502 --> 09:38.868
three, four...

09:40.972 --> 09:42.672
Whoa! Whoa.
Excuse me, uh,

09:42.674 --> 09:44.974
Deb, we need to check
your trunk-- we're
looking for a package.

09:44.976 --> 09:48.378
It is addressed to Retired
Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.913
What a stupid name.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.915
Tell it to your stupid
wife, man-- it's one
of our inside jokes.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.383
You two don't have inside jokes.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.685
Man, we got loads
of inside jokes!

09:55.687 --> 09:58.555
My turtleneck,
uh, my trick hip,

09:58.557 --> 10:00.723
that "Hok-fooey, Jean Luc!"

10:00.725 --> 10:02.091
Get off my truck.

10:02.093 --> 10:05.261
Please, it is
Christmas Eve... Eve.

10:05.263 --> 10:06.896
That's right.
Yes.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.865
That's my night.
So go home

10:08.867 --> 10:10.767
and wait for your package.

10:10.769 --> 10:12.035
All right, fine.
(chuckles)

10:12.037 --> 10:13.503
Okay, whatever.

10:13.505 --> 10:14.604
(sighs heavily)

10:14.606 --> 10:16.873
You know what, Deb,
that's where you're wrong.

10:16.875 --> 10:17.874
There was a time

10:17.876 --> 10:19.876
when we didn't need
people like you.

10:19.878 --> 10:20.944
There was a time
where a man

10:20.946 --> 10:23.012
could go into a place,
buy a thing

10:23.014 --> 10:24.347
and leave with that thing.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.282
And you weren't involved<i> at all.</i>

10:26.284 --> 10:27.717
You lost me, Schmidt.
What are you talking about?

10:27.719 --> 10:30.019
Stores, Winston!
Oh, stores!

10:30.021 --> 10:31.120
I remember those.

10:31.122 --> 10:32.288
Stores?

10:32.290 --> 10:34.691
What are you gonna do?
Pay sales tax?

10:34.693 --> 10:36.192
Park?

10:36.194 --> 10:37.894
(laughing)

10:37.896 --> 10:39.562
Stores!
Oh!

10:39.564 --> 10:41.230
Brick and mortar, baby!
(shattering)

10:41.232 --> 10:42.966
I know that she loves me,

10:42.968 --> 10:45.268
so why won't she touch me?
Larry,

10:45.270 --> 10:47.203
you've got to go home, okay?

10:47.205 --> 10:48.938
Why isn't Nick gone?

10:48.940 --> 10:50.406
It's been four hours.

10:50.408 --> 10:52.909
Reagan's on a plane,
Secret Santa's in an hour,

10:52.911 --> 10:54.143
I'm freaking out...

10:54.145 --> 10:56.446
Well, you can call me Ice Cube.

10:57.082 --> 10:58.615
Because I'm done wrapping.

10:58.617 --> 11:00.383
That is how
you won me over. Look,

11:00.385 --> 11:01.751
the missing piece
of the puzzle

11:01.753 --> 11:03.453
is Nick.
I'm gonna go check in.

11:04.089 --> 11:05.622
One hour till Secret Santa!

11:05.624 --> 11:06.456
Great.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.991
You ever done any Santa work

11:07.993 --> 11:09.692
at the Chatsworth Penney's?

11:10.629 --> 11:12.061
Larry?

11:12.063 --> 11:12.962
Robby!

11:12.964 --> 11:14.631
(crying, sniffling)

11:15.634 --> 11:16.966
(knocking)

11:16.968 --> 11:20.136
Come in.
A little North Pole knock-knock.
(chuckles)

11:20.138 --> 11:21.137
I finished.
Oh.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.472
Thank you, Jess.
And thank you

11:22.474 --> 11:24.574
for what you said about
being with the people

11:24.576 --> 11:25.842
you care about
on Christmas.

11:25.844 --> 11:27.644
Oh, you're welcome.
I-I meant it.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.846
And that is why
I bought a ticket

11:29.848 --> 11:32.448
to go to Seattle to be
with Reagan tonight.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.784
Oh... fa...

11:34.786 --> 11:37.587
¶ La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la. ¶

11:42.027 --> 11:43.459
All right, so how do
I surprise Reagan?

11:43.461 --> 11:44.861
Here's what I'm thinking.
I'm thinking I go

11:44.863 --> 11:46.429
dressed as a fireman,
I knock on the door,

11:46.431 --> 11:48.097
I reveal myself
to be a stripper,

11:48.099 --> 11:50.033
and then I reveal
myself to be Nick.

11:50.035 --> 11:51.934
How does that even... uh...

11:51.936 --> 11:54.203
Are you sure you want
to go to Seattle?

11:54.205 --> 11:56.305
I mean, it's Seattle. Ew.
I mean, it was...

11:56.307 --> 11:58.608
it was basically
your idea, right?

11:58.610 --> 12:00.376
Why don't we
just get you home to...
I got no time.

12:00.378 --> 12:02.945
I'm on a no-fly list, so
I need to leave right now.

12:02.947 --> 12:04.147
Checking in is
very difficult.

12:04.149 --> 12:06.349
Why not just take
that name literally

12:06.351 --> 12:07.950
and you no fly?

12:07.952 --> 12:10.019
Off to Seattle.
Wait, Nick! No! No!

12:10.021 --> 12:12.655
I can't let you go!
Your hair looks so stupid!

12:12.657 --> 12:14.657
What?
You look like a total dork.

12:14.659 --> 12:16.526
My hair looks stupid, I
look like a total dork?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.960
We can't let TSA
see you like this.

12:17.962 --> 12:19.962
But I've had this haircut
for a little bit now.
I know.

12:19.964 --> 12:22.198
You let me go to work, though?
It just looks particularly bad

12:22.200 --> 12:24.200
right this minute.
Then I'll just go like this.

12:24.202 --> 12:26.736
How about now?
No. Mm-mm. Didn't fix it.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.375
I get the impression you don't
want me to go to Seattle.

12:32.377 --> 12:36.145
That's because I don't want you
to go to Seattle.

12:36.147 --> 12:38.314
Well, why not?
I can't tell you.

12:38.316 --> 12:39.549
I mean, i-is this
about Reagan?

12:39.551 --> 12:40.750
Do you not like her?

12:40.752 --> 12:42.318
No, I like Reagan--
she looks like

12:42.320 --> 12:45.021
the front of a ship
come alive. Heh.
Is that why

12:45.023 --> 12:46.222
you've been acting so weird?

12:46.224 --> 12:49.225
I haven't been acting weird.
You've been weird

12:49.227 --> 12:50.993
since the day I got
back from New Orleans.

12:50.995 --> 12:52.395
You're acting
really squirrelly.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.264
You don't think I've
noticed, but I've noticed.

12:55.266 --> 12:57.767
Okay, you're way off base.
I mean, what is it?

12:57.769 --> 12:59.769
I took your advice--
I'm gonna be with somebody

12:59.771 --> 13:02.205
who I find really
special on Christmas.

13:02.207 --> 13:04.207
Nick...
But, surprise, I've still
done something wrong.

13:04.209 --> 13:06.209
Don't go to Seattle. Trust me.

13:06.211 --> 13:08.878
Why is nothing I do ever
good enough for you?

13:08.880 --> 13:12.949
What do you want from me?
I'm doing everything I can here!

13:12.951 --> 13:16.953
Nick, I'm flying Reagan out
from Seattle to surprise you.

13:16.955 --> 13:19.655
I'm your Secret Santa, you jerk.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.928
So<i> this</i> is what it feels like
to be instantly sorry.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.131
SCHMIDT: Where is everyone?
I thought this place

13:28.133 --> 13:29.799
would be crazy.
Ha-ha-ha!

13:29.801 --> 13:31.400
Yeah, those were the days.

13:31.402 --> 13:33.469
Now people prefer
to shop online.

13:33.471 --> 13:34.604
My grandfather
opened this store.

13:34.606 --> 13:37.540
Now it closes with me.
So, to answer your question,

13:37.542 --> 13:39.208
yes, I do drink.

13:39.210 --> 13:41.544
Um... hey, we're looking
for a beanbag chair.

13:41.546 --> 13:42.779
Hey! We have one.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.380
Nice!

13:44.382 --> 13:47.416
Heck, I'll go get it for you.
I'm not doing anything.
Great, great.

13:47.418 --> 13:49.986
Brick and mortar, baby.

13:49.988 --> 13:51.220
(sighs)

13:51.222 --> 13:53.289
A beanbag chair, Winston?
Yeah.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.459
You thought that would be a...
a suitable gift for my bride?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.161
You wouldn't get it.
I mean, it's a reference

13:58.163 --> 14:00.363
to a classic Winston-Cece
mess-around.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.633
Beanbag chair!

14:03.635 --> 14:05.768
Never in my life have I heard

14:05.770 --> 14:07.770
of a game of one-on-one
Pictionary.

14:07.772 --> 14:09.472
We had a moment.
Unmoved.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.307
Okay.
Had you drawn
a picture poo-poo,

14:11.309 --> 14:12.975
would that have been
a good gift for my Cece?

14:12.977 --> 14:13.976
(laughing):
It would have
been hilarious.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.845
Look, Schmidt, I get it

14:15.847 --> 14:17.446
that you are closer
to her than I am.

14:17.448 --> 14:18.781
Uh-huh.
However,

14:18.783 --> 14:20.283
I got my own thing
going on with her.

14:20.285 --> 14:22.585
And I feel like you
don't respect that.

14:22.587 --> 14:24.420
Closer to her?
You are.

14:24.422 --> 14:26.189
That's a good way to
describe our relationship,
Yeah.

14:26.191 --> 14:27.757
comparatively to yours.
Yeah.

14:27.759 --> 14:32.428
Yes, considering
we are man and wife.
Yeah.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.631
Winston, this is
a very cozy,
(sighs)

14:35.633 --> 14:38.301
inoffensive blanket.
Get it.

14:38.303 --> 14:40.203
Has no relevance towards
our relationship.

14:40.205 --> 14:41.470
Why would I do that?
Get the blanket.

14:41.472 --> 14:42.638
No.
Winston, please.

14:42.640 --> 14:44.273
Just get the blanket
and let's go.

14:44.275 --> 14:45.942
Well, since you
asked nicely, no.

14:45.944 --> 14:47.677
Just get the blanket.
No. I don't want
the damn blanket.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.845
Here's the beanbag chair.

14:48.847 --> 14:50.646
Yeah, stores
are the best.

14:50.648 --> 14:52.148
Hey, you guys want
to go get lunch or something?

14:52.150 --> 14:53.282
Nah. How much is it?

14:53.284 --> 14:54.517
It's $249.99.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.319
What? For a beanbag chair?
For a beanbag chair?

14:56.321 --> 14:58.688
Well, we have a cheaper one--
we're just, we're out of stock.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.858
I could order it for you, but
it would take seven to ten days.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.326
Man, stores are the worst.

15:03.328 --> 15:04.894
The admiral will take this.

15:04.896 --> 15:05.895
<i> Whatever happened to Hanukkah?</i>

15:05.897 --> 15:07.163
Hey, Jess, about that...

15:07.165 --> 15:08.564
the-the stuff I s...
Oh, wait,

15:08.566 --> 15:11.968
it's fine-- I...
I must have seemed so crazy.

15:11.970 --> 15:14.237
Let's just enjoy
the holiday, okay?

15:14.239 --> 15:16.305
Okay,

15:16.307 --> 15:17.473
Secret Santa.

15:17.475 --> 15:20.009
By now, the suspense
must be killing you.

15:20.011 --> 15:21.377
As you all know,

15:21.379 --> 15:22.879
uh, Nick knows

15:22.881 --> 15:25.348
his Secret Santa gift
is Reagan flying out

15:25.350 --> 15:27.316
from Seattle to surprise him.

15:27.318 --> 15:28.317
All right.

15:28.319 --> 15:30.386
Merry Christmas,
Nick.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.055
All right, Cece.
That big boy's for you.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.891
What in the hell is that?

15:34.893 --> 15:36.459
Winston, what'd you do with
the thing we just bought?

15:37.662 --> 15:40.162
(gasps)
Beanbag chair!

15:40.164 --> 15:43.866
Beanbag chair!
It's from Winston!

15:43.868 --> 15:45.101
WINSTON: They had to make it
out of this dumb blanket.

15:45.103 --> 15:47.937
Winston, you remembered
our game night. I love it.

15:47.939 --> 15:49.238
You do?

15:49.240 --> 15:50.740
She does.
I do.

15:51.542 --> 15:52.775
Well, you know what, Winston?

15:52.777 --> 15:54.443
You were right--
it's the perfect gift.

15:54.445 --> 15:55.411
I guess I
just have

15:55.413 --> 15:56.879
to come to terms with the fact

15:56.881 --> 15:59.382
that my wife is a little bit
weirder than I thought she was.

15:59.384 --> 16:00.616
It's a prototype, you know?

16:00.618 --> 16:02.018
The real one's on its way.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.419
Didn't have a lot of beans,

16:03.421 --> 16:05.588
so I had to pad it
with rice and oatmeal.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.124
It's a great gift.
Thank you. Good job.
It's perfect!

16:08.126 --> 16:10.126
All right, well, whoever got
Schmidt better have brought it,

16:10.128 --> 16:12.228
'cause Winston set the bar
really high.

16:12.230 --> 16:14.063
Oh, here we go,
here we go.

16:14.065 --> 16:15.865
Here we go. Ooh...
Ooh...

16:15.867 --> 16:18.200
Cashmere socks!<i> Dayanu!</i>

16:18.202 --> 16:20.436
Well, it's not Winston,
it's not Jess.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.239
Cece?
No. No, it's not me.

16:23.241 --> 16:24.941
I got you, boy.
No way.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.542
I got you. This is me.
This is you?

16:26.544 --> 16:29.111
Nicholas! (laughs)
Yeah, come on.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.613
I don't know why I'm
finding the image

16:30.615 --> 16:33.649
of you mispronouncing the word
"cashmere" in a store...

16:33.651 --> 16:35.451
to be so joyful.

16:35.453 --> 16:36.452
"Cadsh-mer."

16:36.454 --> 16:37.954
Winston.
Oh.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.422
Ha-ha! I get one?

16:39.424 --> 16:41.390
Oh, man.
Yeah. Everybody gets one.

16:41.392 --> 16:42.825
That's crazy.
I get one, too.

16:42.827 --> 16:44.293
You know.
Yeah, everybody does.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.628
Aah! For me?

16:45.630 --> 16:48.464
Oh, my stars! A check
made out to my phone company?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.132
Cece, girl,
is this for that night

16:50.134 --> 16:51.634
we got bombed
and called Iceland?

16:51.636 --> 16:52.768
You know it is!

16:52.770 --> 16:53.736
Okay, hold on,
wait a minute,

16:53.738 --> 16:55.738
I had... I had Winston, too.

16:55.740 --> 16:58.240
Somebody got left out.
Who didn't get one?

16:58.242 --> 17:00.042
Oh, Winnie got two gifts?

17:01.012 --> 17:03.212
That's for Winston.
Yeah.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.450
Oh... no, no, it's...

17:07.452 --> 17:08.751
it's fine.

17:08.753 --> 17:10.686
It's... it's my fault.

17:10.688 --> 17:12.288
I must have gotten
so tipsy

17:12.290 --> 17:14.824
on Halloween, I forgot
to write down my own name.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.692
See? It's right there
in the song.

17:16.694 --> 17:19.996
He makes a list,
he checks it twice.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.697
See, this is
probably why Santa

17:21.699 --> 17:22.698
stopped drinking.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.866
Well, here, you know what?

17:23.868 --> 17:25.334
Have this one.

17:27.638 --> 17:31.807
Oh, my God, a hamster?!

17:31.809 --> 17:32.842
You're a pet guy, man.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.844
I am. I am.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.113
But... Jess, you...

17:37.115 --> 17:38.881
you should have him.
No.

17:38.883 --> 17:41.717
I-I got the best gift of all.

17:41.719 --> 17:44.653
Watching you guys give each
other gifts that show you care.

17:44.655 --> 17:46.122
Well, you can't not have a gift.

17:46.124 --> 17:47.823
Besides, Ferguson's
gonna eat him, anyway.

17:47.825 --> 17:49.525
Oh. Well, if...

17:49.527 --> 17:51.627
if Ferguson will eat him,
then I...

17:51.629 --> 17:52.628
I'll take him.

17:52.630 --> 17:54.730
Thanks, Winston.
Of course.

17:54.732 --> 17:57.133
Great Secret Santa, everyone.

17:57.135 --> 17:59.235
You want to go to bed,
little guy?

18:00.171 --> 18:02.071
You want to see
your new room?

18:03.641 --> 18:05.207
(sighs)

18:05.209 --> 18:06.675
I feel horrible.

18:06.677 --> 18:08.644
You have no idea.
She and I got in a thing.

18:08.646 --> 18:09.845
I said something
so stupid.

18:09.847 --> 18:10.746
(door opens)

18:10.748 --> 18:12.014
Sleigh!

18:12.016 --> 18:13.349
OTHERS:
Hey, Reagan.

18:13.351 --> 18:14.650
Hey.
Really?

18:14.652 --> 18:16.819
Do you know how hard it was
to put this thing on

18:16.821 --> 18:18.888
in an airplane bathroom?
<i> Do</i> I.

18:26.664 --> 18:29.098
If you don't get off that wheel
right now,

18:29.100 --> 18:30.866
there's gonna be hell to pay.

18:30.868 --> 18:32.868
Now!

18:32.870 --> 18:34.904
Whoa. Did you understand me?

18:40.111 --> 18:41.777
Oh, you're awa...

18:41.779 --> 18:43.579
you're awake. Great.
Nick, how often

18:43.581 --> 18:45.915
do you sneak into my room
in the middle of the night?

18:45.917 --> 18:48.751
Uh, that you're awake,
uh, this is a first.

18:48.753 --> 18:49.952
Here.
Weird.

18:49.954 --> 18:52.188
Here's some cocoa.

18:52.190 --> 18:54.190
Hey, I wanted to say
that I'm sorry

18:54.192 --> 18:55.858
about what I said.

18:55.860 --> 18:58.294
I know you are. Thanks.

18:58.296 --> 19:01.197
I also want to
say thank you.

19:01.199 --> 19:03.466
Even though I knew Reagan
was coming, when I saw her

19:03.468 --> 19:06.135
I felt like it was Christmas
morning and I was ten.

19:06.137 --> 19:08.904
But a ten-year-old
about to have sex

19:08.906 --> 19:11.474
with Santa!

19:11.476 --> 19:13.409
And it was-- yeah,
this is getting weird.

19:13.411 --> 19:15.211
Anyway, I just
wanted to say...

19:15.213 --> 19:17.480
I'm sorry and thank you.
