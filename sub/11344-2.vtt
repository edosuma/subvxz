(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.104 --> 00:06.707
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.510
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.543 --> 00:11.445
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.479 --> 00:13.047
are members
of an elite squad

00:13.081 --> 00:14.715
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.550
These are their stories.

00:18.452 --> 00:19.553
(guard)
My name's Ed,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.489
and I'm here to listen
to your problems

00:21.522 --> 00:22.656
with empathy...

00:22.690 --> 00:25.093
without judgment
or advice.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.527
Go away.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.429
I care about you,
and I'm sure

00:28.462 --> 00:29.530
many others do too.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.165
Please just leave me alone!

00:32.300 --> 00:33.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Take it easy.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.603
There's got to be a lot of
folks that would miss you.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.206
No!
No one.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.408
What about the baby's father?

00:40.441 --> 00:42.810
You don't understand.

00:42.843 --> 00:46.580
[sobs]

00:46.614 --> 00:50.084
I was raped!

00:50.118 --> 00:51.452
Name?
We never got that far.

00:51.485 --> 00:53.587
Is this her room?
No, she came in here
when the maid was cleaning.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.588
I don't even think
she was staying here.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.490
I need everybody out.
Now.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.663
It's cold out here.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.198
I brought you
something to drink.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.736
I can't drink coffee.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.504
It's just cocoa, okay?

01:12.306 --> 01:16.310
Why don't you take it?
It'll warm up your hands.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.412
I'm just gonna put it
right there, okay?

01:18.446 --> 01:19.447
Here you go.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.888
Thanks.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.624
I'm Olivia.

01:30.658 --> 01:31.892
April.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.796
What's going on, April?

01:35.829 --> 01:37.698
[siren wails]

01:37.731 --> 01:41.269
April, have you picked out
a name for your baby?

01:43.771 --> 01:46.140
Sarah.

01:46.174 --> 01:48.876
Sarah was my mom's name.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.812
She died last year.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.714
Breast cancer.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.819
The security guard
told you?

01:58.852 --> 01:59.920
Yes.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.556
That's why I'm here.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.525
I'm from
the Special Victims Unit.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.730
What if I can't
love my baby?

02:09.763 --> 02:10.731
My baby!

02:10.764 --> 02:12.866
You chose
to keep your baby.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.568
You gave her
a beautiful name.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.737
You already love your baby.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.641
I can't do this alone.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.742
Well, you don't have to.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.412
I want you
to listen to me.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.647
I'm gonna help you.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.582
I promise you,
I will help you.

02:28.616 --> 02:29.450
How?

02:29.483 --> 02:30.251
We're gonna figure it
out together.

02:30.284 --> 02:32.920
Now, will you give me
your hand?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.458
Come on.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.560
[sobs]
No!

02:39.593 --> 02:43.397
[sobbing]

02:43.431 --> 02:44.565
It's okay.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.367
It's okay.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.736
[sobbing]
No.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.552
(Dr. Lambert)
Patient presented

03:38.586 --> 03:39.953
as depressed and tearful
upon arrival.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.555
(Benson)
Her name's April.
April Troost.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.357
Ran a tox screen on her
as well as a blood alcohol.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.358
Both negative.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.359
What about the pregnancy?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.027
She's approximately 35 weeks.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.696
No sign of distress
or malnutrition.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.697
She's good to go.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.698
You mean give birth.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.400
No.
I mean I'm releasing her.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.001
Uh, maybe you missed
the part

03:54.034 --> 03:55.369
where she was gonna
take a swan dive

03:55.403 --> 03:56.537
off a 20-story building.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.038
Her suicidal ideation
has passed,

03:58.071 --> 04:00.007
and she has no history
of prior attempts.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.542
Well, can you guarantee
that she's not

04:01.575 --> 04:02.910
gonna climb out
on the ledge tomorrow?

04:02.943 --> 04:05.012
No, of course not.
So then put her
on a psych hold

04:05.045 --> 04:06.847
until the baby is born.
I can't do that.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.048
She's not acutely psychotic

04:08.081 --> 04:09.750
or a danger
to herself or others.

04:09.783 --> 04:11.719
Hey.
Hey!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.754
The baby--
Baby doesn't count?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.923
Look, she agreed
to outpatient counseling.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.559
My job's done.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.797
I thought I was dealing
with the rape.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.933
Until yesterday.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.935
I just snapped.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.837
That happens.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.940
You're not the first person
to go through this.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.646
Everywhere I look,
I see his face.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.948
Even when I close my eyes.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.651
Why don't you
tell me about him.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.988
We met at a bar
and talked all night.

04:51.592 --> 04:55.028
He offered to walk me home,
and I thought...

04:55.062 --> 04:57.965
Finally, a gentleman.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.634
Went to my apartment.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.570
And I remember praying,

05:02.603 --> 05:06.607
"Please kiss me good night."

05:06.640 --> 05:12.346
It'd been so long.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.448
That's when he shoved me in
and locked the door.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.717
Why didn't you
call the police?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.819
I was a fool.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.421
I actually believed
that he was

05:20.454 --> 05:23.391
interested in me.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.593
A nurse's aide.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.060
I barely have my GED.

05:27.094 --> 05:31.064
April, what happened to you
wasn't your fault.

05:31.098 --> 05:36.937
Facing him is gonna help you
deal with this.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.138
I can't.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.874
You gotta be strong
for little Sarah.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.110
You're all she has.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.547
And I promise
I will help you.

05:46.580 --> 05:49.750
How?

05:49.783 --> 05:53.421
By arresting the man
that raped you.

05:53.454 --> 05:56.089
Tell me his name.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.632
Barclay Pallister.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.870
(Barclay)
You expect me to remember

06:09.903 --> 06:11.839
a woman I met in a bar
eight months ago.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.107
You drank, you laughed,
one thing led to another.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.009
Maybe I'd remember
if we'd had sex.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.511
You did,
and she's calling it rape.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.979
Yeah, by the way,
congratulations.

06:19.012 --> 06:19.980
You're the daddy.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.148
The hell I am.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.583
I didn't have sex
with anybody.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.051
I certainly
didn't rape anyone.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.753
I'm happily married.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.789
Happy enough for the wife
to alibi you?

06:28.822 --> 06:29.790
I was probably here.

06:29.823 --> 06:31.925
I spend more time in the lab
than I do at home.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.193
No alibi.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.597
Well, maybe she saw my photo
in Forbes or Fortune.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.131
Thought I was
an easy target.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.068
All those NBA players out there
and she picked you.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.636
Look, I don't mean to brag,

06:42.670 --> 06:45.038
but women have been crawling
out of the woodwork

06:45.072 --> 06:49.543
ever since my company
went public.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.812
What's up with the stiffs?

06:51.845 --> 06:52.913
They're my gold mine.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.115
I invented
an eco-friendly method

06:55.148 --> 06:57.084
of turning these cadavers
into dust

06:57.117 --> 06:58.519
without ever
lighting a match.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.053
My flash-freeze method

07:00.087 --> 07:02.055
will revolutionize
mortuary science.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.892
And that gets you laid
like a rock star.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.660
I'd never be unfaithful
to my wife.

07:06.694 --> 07:07.528
She stood by me

07:07.561 --> 07:09.497
one failed experiment
after another.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.131
So you have no problem
taking a paternity test.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.132
If it's necessary.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.901
But I'm telling you,

07:13.934 --> 07:15.135
the kid isn't mine.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.637
(Stabler)
DNA proves it.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.071
April Troost's kid

07:18.105 --> 07:20.173
is definitely yours.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.174
But that's impossible.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.976
I didn't touch her.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.878
Immaculate conception's
not gonna hold up in court,

07:24.912 --> 07:25.946
so why don't you try again?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.180
(Zierko)
All right.

07:27.214 --> 07:28.048
Mr. Pallister admits

07:28.081 --> 07:29.917
that he met the defendant
at a bar.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.918
They had drinks,

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
but he does not remember

07:31.985 --> 07:33.821
having sexual relations
with her.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.022
Okay, so you had one too many,

07:35.055 --> 07:36.089
you didn't know
what your body was doing.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.659
Intox defense.
That's...better.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.693
I'd know
if I raped her.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.928
You did.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.964
And April Troost has
a swollen belly to prove it.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.699
In light of the DNA results,

07:45.733 --> 07:47.234
we'll stipulate to paternity.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.237
But the sex was consensual.
There was no rape.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.979
(April)
I begged him to stop.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.848
But he wouldn't listen.

08:00.881 --> 08:04.918
(Novak)
This was after
he bolted the door.

08:04.952 --> 08:08.121
Yes.

08:08.155 --> 08:12.059
He threw me on the floor,
and he pinned me.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.226
I couldn't move.

08:13.260 --> 08:14.962
Did you scream?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.930
At the top of my lungs.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.266
But then he covered my mouth
with his hand.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.834
And I could barely breathe.

08:20.868 --> 08:21.902
Did you fight him?

08:21.935 --> 08:25.939
I think I scratched
his face.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.241
But then he got more violent,

08:28.275 --> 08:30.711
and he put his hands
around my neck like this,

08:30.744 --> 08:33.013
and he choked me.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.182
And I thought
if I stopped screaming,

08:35.215 --> 08:37.651
then maybe...

08:37.685 --> 08:40.320
maybe he wouldn't kill me.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.290
What happened next?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.235
He raped me--

08:55.268 --> 08:59.873
He raped me
over and over and over.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.744
[sobbing]

09:03.777 --> 09:05.278
Do we really want to put
that poor woman

09:05.312 --> 09:06.279
through any more pain?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.347
What are you offering?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.750
Probation,
no jail time,

09:09.783 --> 09:11.952
you and I take
the rest of the afternoon off.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.020
I'd rather work.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.688
15 years.
He does it all.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.090
He's a contributing member
of society, and she belongs

09:17.124 --> 09:17.991
in a psych ward.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.727
Your own detectives
tried to commit her.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.361
You can't use that.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.363
I can in a custody hearing.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.765
First he denies
having sex with her,

09:24.798 --> 09:26.700
now he wants to be
Father of the Year?

09:26.734 --> 09:29.102
It's his baby too.
He'll fight her for it.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.005
Unless she agrees
to a plea.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.275
Ready?

09:37.377 --> 09:39.847
I can't face him again.

09:39.880 --> 09:40.781
You're already
halfway there.

09:40.814 --> 09:43.350
All you have to do
is keep your eyes on me.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.385
[sighs]

09:45.418 --> 09:47.087
Thank you.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.355
(Zierko)
Why did you wait

09:48.388 --> 09:51.291
eight months to report
the alleged rape?

09:56.396 --> 10:00.668
I was scared.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.303
Confused.
Humiliated.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.238
Would you say suicidal?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.339
I wanted to end my life.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.708
Yes.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.009
And your baby's?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.344
No.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.881
That's why I couldn't
hurt myself.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.849
I love my baby too much.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.350
A love so strong,

10:17.384 --> 10:19.186
you're willing to charge
the baby's father

10:19.219 --> 10:20.320
with rape?

10:20.353 --> 10:21.354
It's the right thing
to do.

10:21.388 --> 10:24.057
And nothing
will change your mind?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.293
No.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.198
How about
half a million dollars?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.900
You called my office
this morning

10:32.933 --> 10:34.634
and said you wanted to settle.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.778
What the hell
were you thinking?

10:44.812 --> 10:45.913
That lawyer told me

10:45.946 --> 10:47.948
if I lose,
Barclay will take the baby.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.282
He was lying to you.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.851
I didn't know.

10:50.884 --> 10:51.719
You sandbagged me.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.721
Now the jury sees you
as a gold digger,

10:53.754 --> 10:54.722
not a rape victim.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.723
I'm sorry!

10:55.756 --> 10:57.290
I made a mistake.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.826
Why didn't you
just call me?
Because you'd be mad at me.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.694
You are.
I can see it in your eyes.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.062
I'm not mad.
I'm--I'm--

11:02.095 --> 11:04.297
I'm disappointed.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.099
How bad is it?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.968
Our only choice is to put you
back on the stand

11:08.001 --> 11:09.369
to turn down the settlement.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.338
I'll recall you tomorrow,
and you can testify again.

11:11.371 --> 11:15.375
I will do anything
to set things right.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.316
(Judge Seligman)
My court starts
at 9:00 sharp, Ms. Novak.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.318
Where's your witness?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.320
I'm sure she's just delayed,
Your Honor.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.222
We've been waiting
40 minutes.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.058
She's made her decision.
She wants to settle.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.059
She had every intention

11:32.092 --> 11:33.326
of testifying today.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.461
If I could just have
a brief continuance.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.796
[phone rings]

11:35.829 --> 11:37.998
(Seligman)
Miss Troost has obviously
changed her mind.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.466
I'm not gonna keep that jury
waiting any longer.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.434
(clerk)
Your Honor, I have
Detective Stabler on the line.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.904
Highway police just found
Miss Troost.

11:52.780 --> 11:53.814
(Officer Lowry)
She was traveling

11:53.847 --> 11:55.248
eastbound, missed the curve,

11:55.282 --> 11:56.349
and ran off the cliff
right here.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.417
(Stabler)
No guardrail.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.485
(Lowry)
I bet they'll find

11:58.518 --> 12:00.287
the money
for one after this.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.355
The gas tank burst
into flames on impact.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.957
No survivors.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.099
(Benson)
What time?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.401
Fire Department got the call
around 5:00 this morning.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.469
They said it'd been burning
for quite a while.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.972
She probably fell asleep
at the wheel.

12:19.006 --> 12:22.776
I think you'll find
it's a suicide.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.445
Liv, there's nothing
you could've done.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.014
I was angry,
and I let it show.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.282
You got pissed off
because she lied to you.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.118
She needed somebody
to believe in her.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.860
The trial can still go on
without April, can't it?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.328
What's the point?

12:41.361 --> 12:43.296
I'm offering Barclay a deal.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.099
He raped her and he left her
with a child.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.202
The jury knows
that he did it.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.138
The jury's going to acquit.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.240
Last two words they heard
were cash settlement.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.508
Which she was about
to turn down.

12:55.542 --> 12:59.312
Unless she says so on the stand,
it's inadmissible.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.415
So we just let Barclay walk?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.117
Find me some evidence

13:04.151 --> 13:06.019
she was gonna turn
down the settlement,

13:06.053 --> 13:09.189
and I'll use it to bluff Barclay
into a plea.

13:11.591 --> 13:14.527
(Benson)
There's no suicide note,
no diary.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.997
[sighs]

13:17.030 --> 13:17.931
Nothing on her email.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.067
No documents relating
to the settlement.

13:20.100 --> 13:23.236
Just bills.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.106
Sofa's wet.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.009
What's with the white crust?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.177
(Siper)
Hydrogen peroxide.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.311
Foams up when it comes
into contact

13:31.344 --> 13:32.612
with blood cells.

13:32.645 --> 13:37.184
Bubbles dry and leaves
this white crust.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.419
Check out the wall.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.989
See these smears?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.590
Tried to wipe off the blood.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.025
(Stabler)
And on the floor.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.226
(Siper)
No body,

13:46.259 --> 13:48.328
but this is definitely
a crime scene.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.131
I'd say we have a homicide.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.265
Perp kills April here,

13:52.299 --> 13:54.968
stuffs her body in the car,
and sends it over the cliff.

13:55.002 --> 13:55.969
(O'Halloran)
I figured out

13:56.003 --> 13:57.404
how the crash was rigged.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.906
Looks like
a paint mixing can.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.940
Similar.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.510
But these are used
to store chemicals in labs.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.078
Like Barclay Pallister's.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.479
It was thrown from the car
on impact.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.348
See the angle
of these dents?

14:08.381 --> 14:09.482
They're consistent
with the pail

14:09.516 --> 14:10.217
being wedged under the dash

14:10.250 --> 14:12.252
when the pedal's
to the metal.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.454
I found more evidence
up there.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.223
See these tire marks
in the pavement?

14:16.256 --> 14:19.192
Wheels spun in place.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.161
He wedged in the can,
and revved the engine.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.195
Shift the car into drive,

14:22.229 --> 14:24.264
it takes off
like a rocket.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.632
Kills April in her apartment,

14:25.665 --> 14:27.500
stages the crash here.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.368
With her history,

14:28.401 --> 14:29.569
Barclay knew we'd rule it
a suicide.

14:29.602 --> 14:32.605
Her body burns up so no one ever
knows what he did to her.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.142
I sent everything from the car's
interior over to the morgue.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.310
Maybe Warner can piece together
how she died.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.279
(Warner)
This is all
that survived the fire.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.381
(Benson)
Not very much.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.150
Fire Marshal says
an accelerant was used,

14:43.183 --> 14:44.517
probably gasoline,
to enhance the burn.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.354
Smart guy, wanted to make sure
we didn't find a body.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.422
I didn't.

14:49.456 --> 14:50.657
You mean it was incinerated?

14:50.690 --> 14:53.293
No, I mean, there wasn't one
in that car.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.462
Body burns,
you always find something.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.663
Partial long bones,

14:56.696 --> 14:58.031
dental fillings.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.699
Son of a bitch used
his technology

14:59.732 --> 15:00.700
to vaporize her.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.701
He had to have access

15:01.734 --> 15:03.103
to her home
and her car.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.372
Maybe--maybe somebody
saw him with her.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.140
April keep her car
in a garage?

15:07.174 --> 15:08.375
(doorman)
She parks it

15:08.408 --> 15:09.376
on the street.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.978
Poor Ms. Troost.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.345
She's such
a sweet lady.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.947
Were you the doorman
last night?

15:13.981 --> 15:14.982
Until 11:00.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.349
Who relieved you?
No one.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.350
After I leave,

15:17.384 --> 15:18.986
visitors have
to be buzzed in.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.153
(Munch)
Well, how about security

15:20.187 --> 15:22.355
cameras,
surveillance video?

15:22.389 --> 15:23.490
Management's too cheap.

15:23.523 --> 15:24.457
When I retire in August,

15:24.491 --> 15:26.726
won't even be a day guy
on the door anymore.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.996
(Munch)
When is the last time
you saw April Troost?

15:29.029 --> 15:32.465
Well, she came home
from a dinner date around 10:00.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.433
You sure it was a date?

15:33.466 --> 15:34.434
She was all dolled up.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.435
She went to Luigi's,

15:35.468 --> 15:37.070
which is kinda romantic.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.338
How do you know
what restaurant?

15:38.371 --> 15:40.273
She brought me
a doggie bag.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.476
Nice T-Bone
for my rottweiler.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.577
(Luigi)
'Course I remember her.

15:44.611 --> 15:45.578
She special ordered.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.414
No garlic
because of the baby.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.449
Maybe she was hoping
for a good night kiss.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.483
I don't think so.

15:50.517 --> 15:51.985
They barely spoke
the whole meal.

15:52.019 --> 15:52.986
What did he look like?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.387
Tall.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.989
And from his Black
American Express card,

15:56.023 --> 15:57.024
very rich.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.425
You get a copy
of the receipt?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.527
Should be behind
the bar somewhere.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.295
(Fin)
Uh, how was she acting?

16:02.329 --> 16:03.130
Pretty upset.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.497
Before dessert,
she yelled at him

16:04.531 --> 16:05.498
and stormed out.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.599
(Munch)
Do you know why?

16:06.633 --> 16:08.201
I figured
it was the hormones.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.770
Here it is.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.340
Barclay Pallister.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.347
(Zierko)
This is sour grapes.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.748
You had to dismiss
the rape case,

16:21.781 --> 16:23.150
so you're trying
to pin a homicide

16:23.183 --> 16:24.417
on an innocent man.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.553
The only reason that we lost
the rape case

16:26.586 --> 16:28.021
is because your client killed

16:28.055 --> 16:29.089
April Troost.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.091
Kind of hard to kill someone
in a crowded restaurant.

16:31.124 --> 16:32.625
(Stabler)
But easy at her apartment.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.328
I never went
to her apartment.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.729
Where'd you go after Luigi's?
Straight home.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.498
Will your wife
vouch for that?

16:38.531 --> 16:40.300
She left me
after you charged me with rape.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.102
Well, if the screw fits.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.636
My client met Ms. Troost
in a neutral location

16:43.670 --> 16:44.704
with plenty of witnesses.

16:44.737 --> 16:45.705
No law was broken.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.440
What about witness tampering?

16:47.474 --> 16:48.241
She invited him.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.343
So what do a victim
and a rapist

16:50.377 --> 16:53.046
talk about
over a plate of pasta?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.114
Money.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.448
She had me by the balls,

16:55.482 --> 16:57.550
so I gave her half a million
in cash.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.124
You walked through this city
carrying $500,000

17:04.157 --> 17:05.692
and just handed it over to her.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.759
Yeah.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.461
Then why did she leave crying?

17:08.495 --> 17:09.729
'Cause she's crazy.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.464
I was happy to pay her

17:11.498 --> 17:12.765
just to get her
out of my life.

17:12.799 --> 17:16.769
She left with the money,
and I never saw her again.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.205
The problem is
neither has anyone else.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.372
(Zierko)
We're through here.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.408
Charge my client
or leave.

17:25.478 --> 17:28.248
By the way, your cleanup job
at the apartment sucked.

17:28.281 --> 17:31.151
You should've let April
burn up in that car.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.819
You've made an awful lot
of mistakes,

17:32.852 --> 17:34.687
and I promise they're gonna
catch up to you.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.828
Every piece of evidence points
to Barclay Pallister.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.330
CSU checked his lab.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.565
Same chemical cans,

17:45.598 --> 17:48.301
same industrial strength
hydrogen peroxide.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
Which you could find
in any lab.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.104
It's still circumstantial.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.105
Well, look, the blood

17:52.139 --> 17:53.306
on the sofa,
walls, floor--

17:53.340 --> 17:54.507
they're a DNA match
to April.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.842
We don't have
a body.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.245
Captain, got a nosy neighbor
off the canvass.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.779
Said she complained to April
about loud music

17:59.812 --> 18:00.813
the night she died.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.282
April apologized

18:02.315 --> 18:03.816
and said she'd tell her friend
to turn it down.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.585
Did the neighbor get
a look at this friend?

18:05.618 --> 18:06.586
She just said him.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.354
(Munch)
I may know who.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.755
April's LUDs,
four incoming calls

18:08.788 --> 18:09.889
to her cell phone
after dinner,

18:09.922 --> 18:10.890
all from the same number.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.325
Barclay Pallister.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.160
No.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.228
A Roger Mason.
Lives on East 82nd.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.529
(Roger)
April didn't answer the phone.

18:16.563 --> 18:20.600
I was worried about the baby,
so I kept calling.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.469
That's what friends do.

18:22.502 --> 18:23.703
Most female homicide victims

18:23.736 --> 18:25.672
are killed
by a man they know.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.140
That's another thing
friends do.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.141
You think I killed her?

18:28.175 --> 18:29.376
(Fin)
You got impatient,

18:29.409 --> 18:30.377
'cause she didn't return
your calls.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.378
went over to her apartment,

18:31.411 --> 18:32.612
got in a fight,
and killed her.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.814
I'd never hurt my baby.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.383
Your baby?

18:36.416 --> 18:38.351
(Monica)
Our baby.

18:38.385 --> 18:41.521
We were going to adopt
her unborn child.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.456
April never mentioned that.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.826
We agreed to pay
for the costs and the fees

18:46.859 --> 18:48.861
of the pregnancy
and delivery.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.663
How much does a bouncing
baby girl go for these days?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.532
$50,000.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.634
Sounds like you were
buying a baby.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.669
April didn't
want to keep the baby.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.538
This was best for everyone.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.939
Now do you understand?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.641
We could never hurt April.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.443
Then what was so urgent
that night?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.444
April was depressed.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.379
She'd been through a lot.

19:06.413 --> 19:07.747
Her husband died.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.183
She lost her job,
got behind in the rent.

19:10.217 --> 19:12.419
We had been giving her
extra cash.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.288
But then two days ago
she stopped returning our calls.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.890
(Fin)
April sure made a bundle
off of that rape.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.560
Talk about making a silk purse
out of a sow's ear.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.462
Half a million
from Barclay Pallister,

19:22.495 --> 19:24.264
and 50 grand
for selling the baby.

19:24.297 --> 19:25.932
Not exactly
the poor, fragile victim

19:25.965 --> 19:26.933
we thought she was.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.668
(Benson)
You have no idea.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.403
Meet the Ramseys.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.305
The Harts.
The Fritzlers.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.773
All expectant parents.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.242
All paid 50 grand

19:35.275 --> 19:36.776
to adopt April Troost's baby.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.811
There could be dozens of marks
we don't even know about.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.548
She used the rape and pregnancy
to turn a quick buck.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.683
And everybody she scammed
has motive to kill her.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.953
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Captain Cragen.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.921
I'm Captain Cragen.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.258
Lorraine Dillon.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.793
I'm April Troost's mother.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.865
April said that her mother's
name was Sarah.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.901
I've had six husbands
and as many last names.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.770
But I've always been Lorraine.

20:03.803 --> 20:04.737
Your daughter

20:04.771 --> 20:07.307
also said that you died
of cancer last year.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.810
She always had a problem
with the truth.

20:10.843 --> 20:12.612
When she was a child,

20:12.645 --> 20:13.713
she'd run away.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.248
And when I brought her
back home,

20:15.282 --> 20:17.750
she'd make all these
crazy allegations

20:17.784 --> 20:19.686
against my former husbands.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.621
When's the last time
you saw her?

20:21.654 --> 20:24.257
It was about
four years ago.

20:24.291 --> 20:26.793
We had a fight.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.729
She stole several very expensive
pieces of jewelry,

20:29.762 --> 20:31.664
including
my grandmother's diamond

20:31.698 --> 20:33.266
and ruby necklace.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.601
Did you call the police?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.869
She was my daughter.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.971
Maybe if I'd had, she'd--

20:39.005 --> 20:43.310
she would still be alive.

20:43.343 --> 20:45.345
Do you have any idea
who did this?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.479
Mrs. Dillon,

20:46.513 --> 20:48.381
we think April was mixed up

20:48.415 --> 20:49.382
in some illegal activity.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.650
There are quite a few suspects.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.785
What did she do?

20:52.819 --> 20:55.822
She took a lot of money
from a lot of people.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.794
April always had a way
of hiding things.

21:01.828 --> 21:03.663
I remember once
she said something

21:03.696 --> 21:06.799
about a safe deposit box.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.335
[drill hammers]

21:13.706 --> 21:14.974
Take all the time you need.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.744
Thank you.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.647
(Lorraine)
Any jewelry in there?

21:20.680 --> 21:22.915
No.
Headshots.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.620
(Lorraine)
Those are very handsome men.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.323
(Benson)
And well known.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.759
He's a musician.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.928
This one owns the hottest
restaurant in New York.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.832
This is that new third basemen
that just came up from AAA.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.034
These guys are a lot more
than just good looking.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.871
How about this guy?

21:44.904 --> 21:46.639
Barclay Pallister.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.576
The man who raped my daughter?

21:49.609 --> 21:52.311
Why would she have
his photograph?

22:01.388 --> 22:03.022
April was stalking
Barclay Pallister.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.457
And dozens of other men.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.026
(Benson)
All handsome, rich,
talented,

22:07.059 --> 22:08.728
at the top
of their professions.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.962
I know this guy.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.499
J.J. Price.
I've got his CD.

22:12.532 --> 22:14.133
It's quite a gene pool
she's got here.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.902
April was looking
for a champion breeder.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.437
Barclay was the winner.

22:17.470 --> 22:18.538
(Fin)
Some ho tricked me

22:18.571 --> 22:20.407
into fatherhood,
I'd be pretty worked up.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.641
(Cragen)
And paying child support

22:21.674 --> 22:22.775
for the next 18 years.

22:22.809 --> 22:25.945
17.5% of your income
before taxes.

22:25.978 --> 22:26.979
With April and the baby dead,

22:27.013 --> 22:28.415
Barclay dodges that bullet.

22:28.448 --> 22:29.616
Not for the murder charge.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.783
If he did it.

22:30.817 --> 22:33.420
He's only one of the men
April was stalking.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.488
Let's find out
who else she burned.

22:35.522 --> 22:36.589
(Don)
Oh, that crazy chick?

22:36.623 --> 22:38.858
What'd she say I did?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.059
So you know her?

22:40.092 --> 22:43.029
Yeah, I really wish
I didn't.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.632
You two have sex?

22:45.665 --> 22:46.733
Most likely, yeah.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.067
You forget a hottie like that?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.402
You must get a lot of action.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.837
Dude, you don't know
the half of it, man.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.938
I remember her face.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.105
I just don't remember
the name.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.507
The whole night
was kinda fuzzy.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.174
Where'd you meet her?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.709
At my restaurant.

22:56.743 --> 22:59.479
Every man with a pulse
checked her out.

22:59.512 --> 23:00.780
But she only had eyes
for you?

23:00.813 --> 23:01.714
And my wallet.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.683
But a body like that
is worth every penny.

23:03.716 --> 23:04.884
How much she cost you?

23:04.917 --> 23:05.885
(Don)
Nothing.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.019
She bought me a beer.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.421
Bet that happens a lot.

23:08.455 --> 23:09.956
Well, they usually
expect me to pay,

23:09.989 --> 23:11.791
especially after signing
my last big contract.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.560
But she was different.

23:13.593 --> 23:14.761
She knew everything
about me,

23:14.794 --> 23:15.862
down to my stats.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.565
What'd you do
after the drink?

23:18.598 --> 23:19.832
Think we went back
to my crib.

23:19.866 --> 23:20.900
You think?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.134
That's all you remember?

23:22.168 --> 23:23.803
Dude, I remember
porcelain, man.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.438
Up close
and personal.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.974
How many drinks
did she buy you?

23:28.007 --> 23:30.042
Just one, which never
gives me a hangover.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.110
I was sick as a dog.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.512
Groggy, nauseous?

23:32.545 --> 23:33.513
Both.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.614
I thought I had the flu.

23:34.647 --> 23:35.615
Did you see a doctor?

23:35.648 --> 23:36.616
Didn't have to.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.685
Pulled a random drug test
the next morning.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.686
I failed.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.920
What'd you take?

23:40.953 --> 23:41.921
Nothing.

23:41.954 --> 23:43.923
She doped me.

23:43.956 --> 23:47.627
All right.
What'd they find?

23:47.660 --> 23:50.129
Rohypnol.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.571
What are you doing here?

23:58.605 --> 23:59.872
Just need to ask you
some questions.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.874
Get the hell away from me.
Hear me out.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.810
The rape charge was dropped.
I don't need to talk to you.

24:03.843 --> 24:04.677
Please, just listen to me.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.513
Now, the first time
that you met April,

24:06.546 --> 24:07.647
she bought you a drink.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.748
Yeah, so?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.517
What's the next thing
you remember?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.985
Waking up in my own bed,
alone.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.587
Loss of memory.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.788
Headache?

24:15.822 --> 24:16.823
Nausea.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.928
She put something
in my drink?

24:21.961 --> 24:23.863
Rohypnol.

24:23.896 --> 24:29.569
I told you
I didn't rape her.

24:29.602 --> 24:33.072
I know.

24:35.642 --> 24:39.211
But if she slipped me
a Roofie...

24:39.245 --> 24:42.849
how did I get it up?

24:42.882 --> 24:44.551
The only explanation
is a technique

24:44.584 --> 24:47.019
called electro ejaculation.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.721
I don't like
the sound of that.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.289
Nothing to it.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.924
Insert this end
in the rectum,

24:51.958 --> 24:55.628
an electric shock causes
an involuntary ejaculation.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.198
Love used to be simpler.

24:59.231 --> 25:01.668
The first procedure
was done back in the '70s

25:01.701 --> 25:04.170
on a teenager who died
in a motorcycle accident.

25:04.203 --> 25:05.938
His parents wanted
grandchildren.

25:05.972 --> 25:08.641
It's called
Posthumous Reproduction.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.610
The sperm from a corpse
is viable?

25:10.643 --> 25:12.612
If harvested
within 30 hours.

25:12.645 --> 25:13.646
Will this thing work

25:13.680 --> 25:14.914
if the guy's not dead?

25:14.947 --> 25:15.915
They've recently

25:15.948 --> 25:17.083
started using this technique

25:17.116 --> 25:19.318
on paraplegics
and coma victims.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.588
If your guys were drugged,

25:21.621 --> 25:23.656
they never knew it happened.

25:23.690 --> 25:24.523
(Cragen)
And this is legal?

25:24.557 --> 25:26.693
No state law provides
clear guidance

25:26.726 --> 25:28.094
on how to retrieve sperm
from a man

25:28.127 --> 25:29.829
who's incapacitated
or dead.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.864
And you talked to all the men
that April stalked?

25:31.898 --> 25:32.865
(Benson)
34 guys,

25:32.899 --> 25:33.866
same story.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.001
April buys 'em a drink.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.703
Next thing they know,
it's morning,

25:36.736 --> 25:37.937
she's gone,
they're sick puppies.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.239
Any nightmares
about cattle prods?

25:40.272 --> 25:41.808
Oh, they never knew
what hit 'em.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.710
I thought I heard
of every sex crime.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.912
Damn, who thinks
this stuff up?

25:45.945 --> 25:48.014
Okay, so we know that April
used Barclay Pallister's

25:48.047 --> 25:49.148
sperm to impregnate herself.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.650
What did she do
with the rest?

25:50.683 --> 25:52.251
(Stabler)
A lot of women
out there'd pay big money

25:52.284 --> 25:54.821
to have one of these guys
father their children.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.323
Sperm banks make big bucks
off genius sperm.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.891
We have seven sperm banks
in New York City.

25:58.925 --> 25:59.892
(Cragen)
Let's split 'em up

25:59.926 --> 26:01.661
and hit 'em all.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.032
(woman)
Welcome to the institute.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.767
Please have a seat
and fill this out.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.801
We're not interested

26:08.835 --> 26:09.802
in your services.

26:09.836 --> 26:10.803
Do you know this woman?

26:10.837 --> 26:13.706
April.
She used to work here.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.107
What was her job?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.375
Collections.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.311
She was our accountant.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.947
(woman)
You lying son of a bitch.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.250
You're a fraud.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.152
Listen to that crap.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.687
(McManus)
Excuse me.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.688
Who are you?

26:28.721 --> 26:29.689
(Benson)
The police.

26:29.722 --> 26:30.690
What's going on in here?

26:30.723 --> 26:31.691
That quack tricked me.

26:31.724 --> 26:32.825
I did nothing of the sort.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.126
I want my money back.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.127
Stop.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.829
Now, what exactly
is the problem?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.831
He said my baby
would be playing Mozart.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.399
I told you
there were no guarantees.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.267
She can't even
play Chopsticks!

26:41.300 --> 26:43.102
All she does
is bang on the damn keys!

26:43.135 --> 26:44.270
All right, what exactly
did you promise her?

26:44.303 --> 26:45.404
Nothing.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.139
I inseminated her
with the life juice

26:47.173 --> 26:48.307
of a renowned musician.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.375
A genius in his field
who will

26:49.408 --> 26:51.277
remain nameless.
Then why am I stuck with her?

26:51.310 --> 26:52.645
You provided 50%

26:52.679 --> 26:53.980
of her genetic material.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.347
Perhaps she inherited
your traits.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.417
Okay, how much did you pay
for this super sperm?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.086
$20,000.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.654
I want this woman arrested

27:01.688 --> 27:02.689
for trespassing.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.090
[metal clinks]

27:04.123 --> 27:05.725
What are you doing?

27:05.758 --> 27:06.859
I'm arresting you.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.260
For what?

27:08.294 --> 27:09.896
Stealing sperm.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.764
What?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.705
(McManus)
This is absurd.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.139
You obviously don't understand
the magnitude of my work.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.941
I'm saving the human race.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.776
(Stabler)
By stealing sperm.

27:23.810 --> 27:24.744
I didn't steal anything.

27:24.777 --> 27:25.845
(Benson)
You conspired

27:25.878 --> 27:29.816
with April Troost to forcibly
obtain the mother lodes.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.750
Nobody was forced.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.418
She explained my mission
to the gentlemen,

27:32.451 --> 27:33.720
and persuaded them
to donate.

27:33.753 --> 27:35.421
Yeah, with a cattle prod.

27:35.454 --> 27:36.723
I had no idea.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.725
I'm sorry
if people were hurt.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.426
But their suffering will benefit
the greater good.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.328
And how's that?

27:42.361 --> 27:43.763
The intelligence
of the world's population

27:43.796 --> 27:45.397
is rapidly declining.

27:45.431 --> 27:46.699
Poor, less educated people

27:46.733 --> 27:48.901
are reproducing
at higher rates

27:48.935 --> 27:50.302
than bright,
successful ones.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.171
I have four kids.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.106
Yes.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.709
My work will
reverse mankind's

27:56.743 --> 27:59.111
inevitable demise
by spreading the seeds

27:59.145 --> 28:02.849
of world class scientists,
musicians, athletes.

28:02.882 --> 28:06.218
You're nothing but a Nazi trying
to engineer a master race.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.557
He's a nut job.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.493
A lot of researchers think
he's Nobel Prize material.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.763
Who, the Dr. Mengele
fan club?

28:16.796 --> 28:19.398
Almost everyone
in genetic engineering.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.901
His work in pre-implantation
genetic diagnosis

28:21.934 --> 28:24.270
allows us to screen embryos
for severe disorders

28:24.303 --> 28:27.406
like Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis,
Down Syndrome.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.808
He's legit.

28:28.841 --> 28:30.743
And controversial.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.144
He just invented a technique

28:32.178 --> 28:34.280
for couples to select
their own baby's sex.

28:34.313 --> 28:36.849
And he's researching ways
of manipulating

28:36.883 --> 28:38.350
inherited characteristics

28:38.384 --> 28:40.753
like height, eye color,
intelligence--

28:40.787 --> 28:41.988
Making designer babies.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.155
He can't do it yet.

28:43.189 --> 28:44.290
But in our lifetime,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.458
wealthy couples are gonna be
able to custom-order a baby.

28:46.492 --> 28:47.526
And the couples
who can't afford it?

28:47.559 --> 28:50.396
There'll be two races:
the enhanced and the average,

28:50.429 --> 28:52.431
driving a bigger wedge
between the rich and the poor.

28:52.464 --> 28:55.034
Looks like McManus'
research is on ice.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.135
What happened?

28:56.168 --> 28:57.203
His clinic's broke.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.204
He makes hundreds
of thousands

28:58.237 --> 29:00.006
selling genius sperm.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.007
But his research
is expensive.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.242
It's a temporary setback.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.477
Dr. Frankenstein
had a backup plan.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.019
What's that?

29:13.052 --> 29:14.086
April's life insurance policy

29:14.120 --> 29:16.155
naming you
as the sole beneficiary.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.391
$5 million?

29:19.425 --> 29:20.827
You just went
from zero to rich

29:20.860 --> 29:22.528
faster than it takes
to drive off a cliff.

29:22.561 --> 29:26.032
How could I know April was gonna
have a tragic accident?

29:26.065 --> 29:28.267
Well, she didn't.
You murdered her.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.869
That's preposterous.

29:29.902 --> 29:31.570
It's more like ingenious.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.538
You recognize that?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.373
It's a chemical
storage can.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.108
We found it at the scene
at April's car crash.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.810
It's just like the one
you use at your lab.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.578
Know what else we found
at your lab?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.814
Hydrogen peroxide.

29:41.848 --> 29:43.916
Same concentrate that was used
to clean up April's blood

29:43.950 --> 29:44.984
in her apartment.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.485
Hundreds of labs
use these things.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.519
But I bet yours was

29:47.553 --> 29:49.822
the only one who took out
an insurance policy

29:49.856 --> 29:51.223
on the one person who could
blow the whistle

29:51.257 --> 29:52.358
on where you got your sperm.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.060
(Stabler)
She suckered you, too,
didn't she?

29:54.093 --> 29:56.162
She blackmailed you
so nobody would find out?

29:56.195 --> 29:57.196
That's why you
were so broke.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.031
And if your clinic
closes down,

29:59.065 --> 30:00.432
you're not saving the world.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.234
So you murdered her
for the insurance money.

30:02.268 --> 30:04.203
No.
I loved her.

30:04.236 --> 30:06.105
Oh, so you were sleeping
with her too.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.940
(McManus)
That's disgusting.

30:07.974 --> 30:10.109
She's my daughter.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.611
I didn't kill her.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.981
And I can prove it.

30:17.917 --> 30:18.885
Who told you?

30:18.918 --> 30:21.854
Your father.

30:21.888 --> 30:24.490
Mother always said
never trust a man.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.959
Where's the baby, April?

30:26.993 --> 30:28.460
It was stillborn.

30:28.494 --> 30:29.996
You're a liar.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.130
What, you didn't need
it anymore,

30:31.163 --> 30:32.164
so you killed it?

30:32.198 --> 30:33.966
That's not a very
nice thing to say

30:34.000 --> 30:35.501
to someone in mourning.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.503
Cut the act, April!
I'm sick of your crap.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.108
You were my friend.
You promised to protect me.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.442
When you were a rape victim,

30:43.475 --> 30:45.244
not a rapist.

30:45.277 --> 30:46.645
You sexually assaulted
three dozen men.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.915
Really?

30:48.948 --> 30:50.416
Did they tell you
I assaulted them?

30:50.449 --> 30:53.152
We've got you on extortion
and fraud.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.321
Not to mention ripping off
childless couples.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.923
And extorting
half a million dollars

30:56.956 --> 30:58.224
from Barclay Pallister.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.458
It was a settlement.

30:59.491 --> 31:00.359
There's nothing illegal

31:00.392 --> 31:03.129
about being paid
for my pain and suffering.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.297
Faking your own murder
for the insurance money is.

31:05.331 --> 31:06.198
Gotta hand it to you.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.967
Smearing your own blood
on the walls?

31:08.000 --> 31:08.968
That was good.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.569
You have a sick imagination.

31:10.602 --> 31:12.638
On my best day
I couldn't make this stuff up.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.041
I'm the victim here.
None of this is my fault.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.243
April Troost, you are
under arrest for fraud.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.078
You have the right
to remain silent.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.179
Anything you say can...

31:21.713 --> 31:25.684
You're only charging April
with fraud and extortion?

31:25.717 --> 31:27.419
She's a walking
crime spree.

31:27.453 --> 31:28.921
My hands are tied.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.622
Three dozen of her victims
don't even have

31:30.656 --> 31:31.924
a memory of being raped.

31:31.958 --> 31:32.925
What about the baby?

31:32.959 --> 31:35.127
No hospitals
in the tri-state area

31:35.161 --> 31:36.562
even have a record
that she delivered one.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.597
Casey, trust me,
she did.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.266
And then she sold it
or she drowned it

31:40.299 --> 31:41.267
or who knows.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.102
But that evil bitch did

31:43.135 --> 31:44.103
something terrible
with that baby.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.005
You know, for all we know,

31:46.038 --> 31:48.374
it really was stillborn,
and that's not a crime.

31:48.407 --> 31:49.541
No, it's a con!

31:49.575 --> 31:52.044
April has been scamming us
since day one.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.346
She never had any intention
of jumping off that ledge.

31:54.380 --> 31:55.948
She played you,
so now you're pissed.

31:55.982 --> 31:56.815
Yes, I'm pissed.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.717
But we still have
to find that baby.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.253
Not to mention ruining
Barclay Pallister's life.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.423
That's not our fault.
That's April's.

32:04.456 --> 32:07.193
And knowing her, she will find
someone else to blame.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.061
Her mother.

32:09.095 --> 32:12.464
April was raised without
any moral values whatsoever.

32:12.498 --> 32:13.699
So she's a sociopath.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.168
April's well aware
of right and wrong,

32:16.202 --> 32:18.204
but she believes
the law doesn't apply to her.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.339
That's how she was brought up.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.974
My mother told me
that storks bring babies

32:22.008 --> 32:23.609
and that Santa came
down the chimney.

32:23.642 --> 32:25.477
But you know what,
you grow up and you realize

32:25.511 --> 32:27.279
that some of the things
your parents told you

32:27.313 --> 32:29.415
aren't true.
Not if you're brainwashed.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.716
April Troost is like

32:30.749 --> 32:33.219
a suicide bomber,
indoctrinated from birth.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.754
She lives her life
by the lies her mother told her.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.991
Ignorance of the law
is no defense.

32:39.025 --> 32:40.592
Mental defect is.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.029
Your shrink will agree,
April wasn't responsible

32:43.062 --> 32:44.396
for her actions.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.001
Mother had me running scams

32:49.035 --> 32:50.402
from the day I was born.

32:50.436 --> 32:53.072
I saved her thousands
in hospital bills.

32:53.105 --> 32:55.474
(Huang)
She conned her doctor?

32:55.507 --> 32:58.510
She took him
for everything he had.

32:58.544 --> 33:03.015
He was husband
number two.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.117
Do you find tricking people
amusing?

33:05.151 --> 33:07.586
Absolutely.

33:07.619 --> 33:08.687
Mother always said

33:08.720 --> 33:10.722
if you're too stupid
to see the wool

33:10.756 --> 33:11.790
being pulled over your eyes,

33:11.823 --> 33:12.758
you deserve what you get.

33:12.791 --> 33:15.127
So it's okay
to rip people off,

33:15.161 --> 33:17.129
to break the law?

33:17.163 --> 33:19.598
[scoffs]

33:19.631 --> 33:21.533
I know there are rules.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.269
But they don't apply to me.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.105
How did that
go over in school?

33:26.138 --> 33:27.506
I didn't go to school.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.508
Mother didn't want me picking up
any bad habits.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.343
Like what?

33:31.377 --> 33:32.578
Feeling sorry for people.

33:32.611 --> 33:36.182
What mother called
"getting soft."

33:36.215 --> 33:39.151
She taught me to stay alert.
Be on the lookout.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.552
For what?

33:40.586 --> 33:44.090
There are always people who want
to take advantage of me.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.792
That's why I have to take
advantage of them first.

33:46.825 --> 33:48.827
Survival of the fittest.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.662
Screw or get screwed.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
Mother drilled that into me.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.800
She taught me everything
she knew about people.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.668
Men in particular.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.172
She went through six husbands
and their fortunes.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.144
What about your father,
Dr. McManus?

34:05.177 --> 34:08.380
Husband number one.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.649
She left him right
after I was born.

34:10.682 --> 34:13.619
He was brilliant
but broke.

34:13.652 --> 34:16.155
I didn't meet him
until a year ago.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.758
He was thrilled to find
the daughter he never knew.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.295
And how did you feel?

34:23.329 --> 34:25.131
It was the opportunity
of a lifetime.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.298
I needed a job,

34:26.332 --> 34:27.833
and he paid me well

34:27.866 --> 34:30.569
to bring him
the best genetic material.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.838
Barclay Pallister.

34:32.871 --> 34:35.841
April, don't you think

34:35.874 --> 34:38.177
that he deserves to know
where his baby is?

34:38.210 --> 34:42.881
Only if I get a sweet deal.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.684
Why should you get a break?

34:45.717 --> 34:49.355
I'm too beautiful for prison.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.389
(Lorraine)
I had no idea

34:50.422 --> 34:51.890
how sick she really is.

34:51.923 --> 34:54.160
April fooled everybody.

34:54.193 --> 34:55.227
She's quite an actress.

34:55.261 --> 34:57.396
I bailed her out,
and this is the thanks I get.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.431
All of her problems
are my fault.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.400
Can she do this?

35:01.433 --> 35:03.302
Can she tell
all these lies in court?

35:03.335 --> 35:05.137
I can make sure
the jury hears the truth.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.438
You can testify.
No.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.908
Let her say what
she wants about me.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.344
I'm on my way
back to Florida tonight.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.883
Hi, Mom.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.318
How could you do this
to your own mother?

35:19.351 --> 35:20.286
Oh, some mother.

35:20.319 --> 35:23.222
You led the cops right
to my safe deposit box.

35:23.255 --> 35:25.257
Too bad the money
wasn't there.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.658
This is not about the money.

35:26.692 --> 35:28.894
Just tell them
where the baby is.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.862
Are you kidding?

35:30.896 --> 35:33.399
I'm through with you.

35:36.402 --> 35:38.170
No way I'm letting April walk.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.137
Well, if we don't give her

35:39.171 --> 35:41.573
some kind of plea,
we may never find the baby.

35:41.607 --> 35:42.608
How do we know
it's alive?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.276
I'm sure of it.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.178
It's her only
bargaining chip.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.546
We checked out all the couples
who had contracts

35:47.579 --> 35:48.914
to buy April's baby.

35:48.947 --> 35:49.781
None of them have
the child.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.717
Hotel clerk says
she checked in alone.

35:51.750 --> 35:52.718
She was not pregnant.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.453
There are no leads
off her LUDs.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.687
That baby could be anywhere.

35:55.721 --> 35:57.223
Black market in newborns?
That's booming.

35:57.256 --> 35:58.557
She's a cold-hearted bitch.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.226
But is she crazy?

36:00.259 --> 36:01.793
No.
She's amoral.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.362
She knows what she's doing
is wrong.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.697
The jury will see it
as just another con job.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.533
Take her to trial,
you're never gonna find the kid.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.700
(Stabler)
Wherever the baby is,

36:08.734 --> 36:09.901
it's better off
than being with April.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.403
Unless she sold the kid
to a pedophile.

36:11.437 --> 36:13.872
You have to find my baby.

36:13.905 --> 36:14.873
Mr. Pallister.

36:14.906 --> 36:15.874
You must make April

36:15.907 --> 36:17.243
tell you where the baby is.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.910
(Novak)
She won't.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.546
Unless we let her off,
and I can't do that.

36:20.579 --> 36:22.914
You have to.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.817
She's a dangerous woman.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.287
You owe me.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.525
Do we have
any other leverage on her?

36:37.296 --> 36:38.530
(McManus)
You're wrong about April.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.299
She's a sweet girl.

36:40.332 --> 36:43.001
If anyone's to blame,
it's her mother.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.771
I never should've chosen
Lorraine.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.974
For what?

36:49.007 --> 36:50.276
My first experiment.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.511
I was looking
for the perfect woman.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.846
Bright, beautiful,
accomplished.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.348
Lorraine was ideal.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.318
I married her,
and we had April.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.919
She was a beautiful baby.

37:00.952 --> 37:02.654
Smart.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.490
170 IQ.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.325
Great, but what happened
to your experiment?

37:06.358 --> 37:08.760
I thought I'd picked
the ultimate mate,

37:08.794 --> 37:12.331
but Lorraine wanted
to be rich.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.366
I wasn't.

37:14.400 --> 37:19.705
I didn't see April
till she found me last year.

37:19.738 --> 37:23.309
I was just so happy
to have my daughter back.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.476
Your daughter's

37:24.510 --> 37:26.978
using you to scam
rich and powerful men.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.380
She meant no harm.

37:28.414 --> 37:29.681
She was just trying
to help me.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.016
By claiming Barclay Pallister

37:31.049 --> 37:32.651
raped her and then having
his child to prove it?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.019
She knew it was wrong.

37:34.052 --> 37:36.021
And she came to me.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.390
And she said
that she had to die

37:38.424 --> 37:39.691
to fix this mess she made.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.627
Right, and you'd collect
on her insurance.

37:41.660 --> 37:42.428
No, no, I was--

37:42.461 --> 37:44.396
I was gonna give April
all the money

37:44.430 --> 37:45.797
so she and the baby
could start a new life.

37:45.831 --> 37:48.667
Except that new life
doesn't include the baby.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.636
What do you mean?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.338
April doesn't have the child.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.373
And she won't tell us
where it is.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.542
She'll tell me.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.510
(McManus)
April, you're confused.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.779
You're not thinking about
what's best for the baby.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.448
I'm not confused.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.082
I'm thinking about
what's best for me.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.083
No one else will.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.752
I will.
Yeah, right.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.320
They offer you a deal

38:08.354 --> 38:10.088
if you got me
to give up the kid?

38:10.121 --> 38:12.491
No, I'm just trying
to help you.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.361
Why?

38:15.394 --> 38:18.330
I'm your father.
I love you, April.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.431
Love is for suckers.

38:19.465 --> 38:20.732
That baby's my ticket
out of here.

38:20.766 --> 38:24.970
I want my deal.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.373
I can't give you one.

38:27.406 --> 38:30.376
Well, then I can't
give you my baby.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.012
Please.

38:34.045 --> 38:37.416
Take this baby away from her
before she destroys it.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.596
Fine, you have your deal.
No jail.

38:50.629 --> 38:51.697
Now, where's the baby?

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
Nice doing business with you.

39:12.951 --> 39:14.520
Novak let you off,
didn't she?

39:14.553 --> 39:15.854
Yeah.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.456
I'm glad.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.625
Why?

39:19.658 --> 39:21.527
Because you don't deserve
to be a mother.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.761
And I'm gonna make sure

39:22.794 --> 39:25.130
that you never see
that child again.

39:25.163 --> 39:27.866
Good.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.901
Maybe the kid'll have
a chance.

39:35.641 --> 39:37.509
(woman)
You poor thing.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.478
They stole your purse
at the funeral?

39:39.511 --> 39:40.779
Yes.

39:40.812 --> 39:44.450
My credit cards,
my ID, my cash.

39:44.483 --> 39:45.551
My daughter is dead,

39:45.584 --> 39:47.486
and I just want to
get my grandbaby

39:47.519 --> 39:48.487
back to Florida.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.488
Well, here's a voucher

39:49.521 --> 39:51.623
for a train ticket
to Miami.

39:51.657 --> 39:52.858
Thank you.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.660
(Benson)
You're not going anywhere.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.463
Detectives.

39:57.496 --> 39:58.864
Oh, man, you are
a piece of work.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.638
Just curious.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.139
How did you track me down?

40:08.173 --> 40:10.442
Your daughter gave you up.
You two have been

40:10.476 --> 40:11.309
working together
all along.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.178
That was quite
a performance you gave

40:13.211 --> 40:15.080
at our squadroom.
Well, that's my girl.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.915
I taught her
everything she knows.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.485
Well, you won't be teaching
that child a damn thing.

40:19.518 --> 40:21.520
I can't prove that you broke
the law this time.

40:21.553 --> 40:23.789
But lady...

40:23.822 --> 40:25.190
I am gonna get you.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.542
(Cragen)
Olivia.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.543
How's the baby?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.545
Sarah's fine.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.714
Not that April
or her mother give a damn.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.916
I bet you they're
in a bar right now

40:50.949 --> 40:51.917
laughing at us.

40:51.950 --> 40:52.951
Let it go.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.487
I can't.

40:55.521 --> 40:56.655
They scammed everyone,

40:56.688 --> 40:57.989
and we just let them walk.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.190
We got the baby.

40:59.224 --> 41:02.227
I know, but we haven't seen
the last of them.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.564
They will never stop
playing their sick games.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.265
Okay, she's
medically cleared.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.767
You can take her.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.801
Hi.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.672
(Cragen)
Liv, you gotta stop

41:13.705 --> 41:14.906
beating yourself up.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.176
The baby matters more.
Now she'll be loved.

41:22.681 --> 41:24.149
(Barclay)
I was up all night

41:24.182 --> 41:25.617
preparing her room.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.152
'Cause Sarah deserves
the best.

41:27.185 --> 41:28.754
(Stabler)
Well, she's certainly got it.

41:28.787 --> 41:29.821
(Benson)
You take care.

41:29.855 --> 41:32.558
Thank you.

41:32.591 --> 41:36.695
I hear April's IQ is 170.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.898
That's what Dr. McManus
says, yeah.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.800
Yes, I've read up on him.
He's brilliant.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.870
And she has good genes
on my side too.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.905
She's perfect.

41:48.974 --> 41:49.040
