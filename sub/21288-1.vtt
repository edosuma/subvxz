00:20.020 --> 00:23.022

00:58.600 --> 01:00.601
( rattles, hisses )

01:06.608 --> 01:15.282

02:01.121 --> 02:04.748
( shouting in Spanish )

02:22.308 --> 02:24.309
SANTOS LIVES!
SANTOS lS PRESENT!

02:32.777 --> 02:34.862
So how have you been?
Do you stiII, uh...

02:35.029 --> 02:38.323
Shh! My wife would kill me.

02:38.491 --> 02:39.658
l switched to birds.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.952
- Birds?
- Birds.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.954
( Iaughs )
Exotic-- import-export.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.331
- l got my own plane.
- Mmm?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.208
How about you?
StiII writing?

02:48.376 --> 02:50.669
Si. l'm down here
doing a story on the rainforest.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.840
Huh. Poor Santos,
he was in the middle of that shit.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.929
They would stop at nothing.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.931
They had the government
in their pocket.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.933
All they wanted was land--

03:05.101 --> 03:08.937
our land, our rainforest.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.652
But Santos,
he could not stand for it.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.905
He organized the people.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.823
( chainsaws buzzing )

03:30.501 --> 03:32.878
Oh no. Not again.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.599
Man: For the last time, Santos,
get the hell out.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.310
( gunshot )

04:01.032 --> 04:04.243
Radio host: RafaeI Santos--
leader of the rubber tappers,

04:04.410 --> 04:06.912
staged a passive
resistance in Padre

04:07.080 --> 04:09.122
against the cattle ranch company.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.417
Santos-- a symbol today
for environmentaIists

04:12.585 --> 04:14.628
and ecology groups
all over the world--

04:14.796 --> 04:16.838
has been the target
of death threats.

04:17.005 --> 04:18.673
Santos vehemently states,

04:18.841 --> 04:21.760
"We will not allow this deliberate
destruction to continue."

04:22.929 --> 04:24.930
( wipes feet )

04:29.143 --> 04:31.436
Buenas noches.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.019
( grunts, groaning )

05:14.147 --> 05:16.315
 Papi!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.276
( metal clanks )

05:21.154 --> 05:23.196
 Papi!  Papi!

05:23.364 --> 05:25.824
 Mami, mami!

05:27.160 --> 05:29.161
 Papi!

05:30.663 --> 05:32.831
Papi,  que te pasa?

05:32.999 --> 05:36.168
Papi. Ma--  mami!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.836
 Mami!

05:38.004 --> 05:41.506
-  Mami!  Mami!
-  Rafael!

05:41.674 --> 05:44.009
Man: To kill a man
in front of his daughter--

05:44.177 --> 05:46.219
that is the work of a coward.

05:46.387 --> 05:47.429
( crying )

05:47.597 --> 05:50.515
But it is an old story--

05:50.683 --> 05:52.934
lndians against rubber tappers,

05:53.102 --> 05:55.354
tappers against lndians
for a piece of land,

05:55.521 --> 05:57.522
cattle ranchers against both,

05:57.690 --> 05:59.608
and buying everything
with big money.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.526
- Yeah, l remember that.
- ( laughs )

06:01.694 --> 06:04.529
Do you know where
l can pick up a cheap car?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.365
You can take mine.
I don't use it.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.116
- You're gonna give me your car?
- Yes.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.786
( crowd clamoring )

06:10.953 --> 06:14.623
SAVE OUR AMAZON

06:14.791 --> 06:16.666
SANTOS LlVES!

06:16.834 --> 06:19.711
( clamoring continues )

06:31.057 --> 06:32.849
Man:
 Santos vive!

06:33.017 --> 06:35.018
Crowd:
 La lucha continua!

06:35.186 --> 06:37.729
( chanting continues )

06:37.897 --> 06:40.023
 La lucha continua!

06:44.320 --> 06:46.071
Man:
 Santos vive!

06:46.239 --> 06:48.240
 La lucha continua!

06:48.408 --> 06:51.076
( chanting continues )

07:01.754 --> 07:04.631
But Rafael Santos never stopped

07:04.799 --> 07:06.758
believing in non-violence.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.344
Although threatened many times...

07:09.512 --> 07:12.222
- ( cameras cIicking )
- ...he and his followers held fast

07:12.390 --> 07:15.100
LET US FlGHT TO SAVE OUR AMAZON
to the principIes of passive resistance,

07:15.268 --> 07:18.603
teaching us
that to stop the bloodshed

07:18.771 --> 07:21.565
and wanton rape of the land,

07:21.732 --> 07:25.777
we must think not
of the differences that separate us,

07:25.945 --> 07:29.114
but the common interests
that bind us together--

07:29.282 --> 07:33.160
our love of the rainforest
and all the living things in it,

07:33.327 --> 07:38.081
and our need to improve
the impoverished state

07:38.249 --> 07:40.375
of men and women
of this country.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.462
Rubber tappers, lndians,

07:43.629 --> 07:46.798
farmers and environmentalists

07:46.966 --> 07:49.885
must all work together
to help each other

07:50.052 --> 07:54.890
so that our dear
departed friend-- ahem--

07:55.057 --> 07:59.561
Rafael Santos,
leader of the Rubber Tappers' Union,

07:59.729 --> 08:04.316
good father, husband
and friend to the rainforest,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.318
you may rest in peace.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.654
( thunder rumbling )

08:14.160 --> 08:17.704
- ( praying in Spanish )
- ( rain pattering )

08:35.306 --> 08:38.308
( thundering continues )

08:42.020 --> 08:43.813
- Woman: How are you doing?
- Woman #2: Fine.

08:43.981 --> 08:47.692
- Woman: Holding up okay?
- l guess.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.736
Do you want me
to do anything?

08:49.904 --> 08:53.281
lt's okay.
You have done a lot already.

08:55.826 --> 08:58.578
WeII then,
you must've been very close.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.622
Did you see a man?

09:00.790 --> 09:02.791
No, just a policeman.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.460
Policeman?

09:05.628 --> 09:07.379
What policeman?

09:09.715 --> 09:12.092
Just a policeman.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.805
Gloria, have you eaten
anything yet?

09:16.973 --> 09:18.723
Alyssa's been looking for you.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.059
She's in the kitchen. Go.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.854
- Ahem. Hello.
- Hello.

09:25.022 --> 09:26.565
l'm very sorry about your husband.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.192
- You have my condolences, ma'am.
- Thank you.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.654
Do you feel that you know
who killed your husband?

09:32.822 --> 09:38.076
l feel that anybody
who didn't stop it did it.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.249
( sighs )

09:45.918 --> 09:47.752
- Are you okay?
- Yes, l am okay.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.588
Do you want something to eat?
Are you hungry?

09:49.755 --> 09:51.423
- GirI: Yes.
- Woman: Yes?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.009
( both chuckle )

09:57.013 --> 09:59.389
Hello.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.308
l don't think we have met.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.477
l don't think we have.
l'm R.J. O'Brien.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.523
- Alyssa Rothman.
- Pleased to meet you.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.985
So are you here for a visit?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.154
Yeah.
What about you?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.281
- l work here.
- Yeah?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.159
l'm with the Rainforest
Preservation Society.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.620
Oh yeah. What do you--
what do they do?

10:21.787 --> 10:25.624
We're a privately-endowed foundation
that supports Santos's work.

10:25.791 --> 10:27.334
Oh, so you're the good guys

10:27.501 --> 10:30.670
in this whoIe
rainforest enchilada, huh?

10:30.838 --> 10:34.257
lt's just a little bit more than
an enchilada to me, Mr. O'Brien.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.676
Oh.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.720
WeII, see,
as far as l'm concerned,

10:38.888 --> 10:41.806
that's the probIem--
everybody takes this thing too seriously.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.225
I mean, in America
you got the politicians,

10:44.393 --> 10:46.519
you got the singers
and the Hollywood actors

10:46.687 --> 10:48.647
all jumping on the bandwagon
doing speeches

10:48.814 --> 10:51.775
about the poor birds and the bees
in the Amazon. ( laughs )

10:51.942 --> 10:55.570
You know what l mean? lt's just like--
it's like the fucking fashion, you know?

10:55.738 --> 11:00.158
Well, l'm not in Hollywood,
as you can see here.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.035
lt's been a long time
since l've known

11:02.203 --> 11:04.788
that this cause is a lot more
than just the birds and the bees, okay?

11:04.955 --> 11:06.748
- Mm.
- There're people out there with rights,

11:06.916 --> 11:08.792
the right to live the way--
the way that they want.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.252
And Santos and l have been
working to protect that right.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.006
So yes, it is very serious, Mr. O'Brien,
and it's not an enchilada,

11:15.174 --> 11:19.010
which by the way is a Mexican dish,
not a BoIivian.

11:20.805 --> 11:25.266
Well, as l predicted, l offered Nacia
the check and she refused it.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.726
- As you predicted.
- Yeah.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.937
You're much too pure
for the rest of us, Alyssa.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.689
- Oh yes.
- Lucavida wanted to help

11:30.856 --> 11:32.607
and she had the right to say
yes or no.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.193
- l know. You know l didn't mean to--
- l know,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.237
- and that's why l keep you around.
- Yes.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.947
Oh, we're going to be late
for the meeting.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.324
- Do you need a ride?
- Um, no. No, l have my car.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.952
- Okay. Don't be late.
- I won't. Bye.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.251
( instrumental music playing )

12:02.430 --> 12:06.725
Priest: Gentlemen, l wish to thank you
for your presence here today.

12:06.892 --> 12:10.186
And of course l would like
to thank Mr. Lucavida,

12:10.354 --> 12:12.897
who's been kind enough
to lend us his lovely house

12:13.065 --> 12:16.818
in order that we may discuss
the unfortunate circumstances

12:16.986 --> 12:19.904
surrounding the death
of our dear friend.

12:20.072 --> 12:23.241
A house built with the money
he stole from the rubber tappers.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.327
We're not to blame for the old rivalries

12:26.495 --> 12:29.664
between you-- the tappers--
and the lndian tribes.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.084
The big ranchers--
you destroy everything.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.961
Please.

12:35.129 --> 12:38.089
Our situation is
only going to get worse

12:38.257 --> 12:42.719
unless we learn to coexist within
the economic realities of this country.

12:42.887 --> 12:47.265
Gentlemen, this is our test.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.101
lf we fail, we all lose.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.353
Man: No, l don't accept
as an economic reality

12:52.521 --> 12:56.024
a group of cattIe ranchers
destroying all our rubber trees

12:56.192 --> 12:57.859
so they can export
their meat to the gringos.

12:58.027 --> 13:01.613
We want to know
who killed Rafael Santos first.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.117
Se metio, senor.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.956
Buenos dias.
Buenos dias.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.834
And who are you?

13:15.002 --> 13:18.421
Well, l'm R.J. O'Brien. l, uh--

13:18.589 --> 13:22.258
l knocked on your door, but there was
nobody there to answer. And, uh--

13:22.426 --> 13:25.762
well, l'm down here doing an article
for an American magazine and--

13:25.930 --> 13:28.306
Shall l call the police?

13:28.474 --> 13:31.601
- l'm sure Mr. O'Brien...
- Yes.

13:31.769 --> 13:36.147
...didn't realize it was my home
into which he was intruding.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.317
Now wait a minute.
You're not Mr. Lucavida?

13:40.319 --> 13:42.862
- Please.
- lt's a pleasure to meet you.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.240
This is not a good time
for an interview.

13:45.407 --> 13:48.493
- No.
- Perhaps l can call you.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.787
Man:  Santos vive!

13:50.955 --> 13:52.872
Crowd:
 La lucha continua!

13:53.040 --> 13:55.500
( continue speaking Spanish )

13:55.668 --> 13:59.254
-  La lucha continua!
-  Santos vive!

13:59.421 --> 14:01.381
( chanting continues )

14:06.428 --> 14:09.264
- Man: Rafael Santos.
- Crow: Presente.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.433
( ballad playing )

14:27.449 --> 14:30.493
R.J.: lt seems like he was
against progress for your country.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.704
I mean,
he fought against bank loans

14:32.872 --> 14:35.874
for the building of roads,
for the buiIding of dams.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.127
- lt's no wonder he pissed people off.
- Man: He was not against progress.

14:39.295 --> 14:42.046
He was against
the destruction of the rainforest,

14:42.214 --> 14:45.300
against development that
only benefits the big companies

14:45.467 --> 14:47.218
and the powerful
who expIoit us.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.679
He probably pissed off
some landowners, right?

14:49.847 --> 14:52.307
Rafael made a lot of enemies
in his Iifetime.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.059
He's not the first to die
over the rainforest.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.811
He won't be the last.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.606
 Que pasa, Aringo.  Que tienes?
 Que tienes, Aringo?  Que pasa?

14:59.773 --> 15:01.024
Hey hey,  que pasa?

15:01.191 --> 15:03.109
( groans )

15:03.277 --> 15:04.319
Woman: Dios.

15:04.486 --> 15:07.739
( altercation continues )

15:07.907 --> 15:10.241
( grunts )

15:10.409 --> 15:13.119
No pictures!

15:13.287 --> 15:15.622
- Give me the camera!
- ( woman screams )

15:15.789 --> 15:18.416
Un momento.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.419
l'll give you the film.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.008
Lo siento.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.427
Aqui aqui aqui.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.429
( groans )

15:33.724 --> 15:35.683
( sighs )

15:41.065 --> 15:42.941
Muchas gracias.

15:43.108 --> 15:46.110
( chattering in Spanish )

15:54.119 --> 15:56.079
The guy's got a bad temper.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.915
The whoIe goddamned roII
of film-- can you believe that?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.334
- We have to go now.
- Oh no, amigos--

16:01.502 --> 16:03.628
no no no, no no no.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.672
 Amigos!

16:05.839 --> 16:08.466
The interview is not over yet!

16:11.428 --> 16:14.764
That's probabIy how
you stuck by Santos!

16:18.477 --> 16:22.021
- ( music pIaying )
- ( women laughing, cheering )

16:26.860 --> 16:29.696
( cheering )

16:56.306 --> 16:59.308
( whistle blows )

17:05.898 --> 17:10.694
Excuse me, do you know
where Senor Pedrosa is?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.912
( train whistle blows )

17:33.052 --> 17:35.720
( siren blaring )

17:45.689 --> 17:47.190
( siren stops )

17:48.192 --> 17:51.944
lf l could ask you a few questions.
Who do you think kiIIed Santos?

17:52.112 --> 17:54.572
I mean, given the fact
that he was asking for it.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.408
You want to be more carefuI
choosing your words, Mr. O'Brien.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.577
Well, let's face it.
The guy was a pain in the ass.

17:59.745 --> 18:03.039
- He was giving everybody trouble.
- Mmm, not unlike yourself.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.124
He got the wrong people angry.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.001
What wrong peopIe
are you talking about?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.753
Well, that's hard to tell--

18:08.921 --> 18:11.589
cattle ranchers, authorities,

18:11.757 --> 18:13.841
lndians.
Who knows?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.384
And what about
the timber industry?

18:15.552 --> 18:17.428
You guys weren't very happy
with him either, were you?

18:17.596 --> 18:20.723
The timber industry is older
than the rubber business.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.518
Yeah, but you cut down the forest,
you destroyed the trees.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.854
Ah, no more than you destroy
your hair when you cut it.

18:27.022 --> 18:29.524
Yes, but what are you gonna do
when your resources are depleted?

18:29.691 --> 18:31.651
Ah, that will only happen
if we become greedy.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.278
( gunshots )

18:34.446 --> 18:36.322
( shouting in Spanish )

18:38.492 --> 18:40.910
( gunshot )

18:41.078 --> 18:42.995
( shutter clicks )

18:44.790 --> 18:47.291
( clicking continues )

18:47.459 --> 18:49.544
- Quieto. Quieto.
-  No!

18:49.711 --> 18:52.630
( speaking Spanish )

18:58.345 --> 19:00.263
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.
- Step back!

19:00.430 --> 19:01.973
Put down your weapons.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.309
( speaks Spanish )

19:06.311 --> 19:09.397
- ( R.J. groans )
- Nobody's gonna hurt you.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.941
- ( shutter clicks )
- l'll kill him.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.403
Okay. Let's go.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.990
Let's go.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.992
( grunts )

19:24.204 --> 19:26.831
( groaning )

19:37.467 --> 19:38.634
No pictures.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.846
Hey, stop it.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.681
 Alto!
You're gonna kill him!

19:43.849 --> 19:45.183
 Alto!

19:49.897 --> 19:51.856
Take them.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.326
( speaking Spanish )

20:06.747 --> 20:09.749
R.J.: What about
the fucking phone call?!

20:19.384 --> 20:21.427
Do you wanna tell me
what that was all about?

20:22.429 --> 20:25.598
Exc-- can you hear--
excuse me, can you fucking hear me?!

20:25.766 --> 20:28.142
Huh?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.646
You speak English?

20:31.813 --> 20:34.565
 Habla espanol?

20:36.026 --> 20:38.277
 Como estas?

20:38.445 --> 20:40.238
Ah, bien. Bien.

20:40.405 --> 20:42.365
( whispers )
Fuck me.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.954
- ( keys cIinking )
- ( locks opening )

20:58.590 --> 21:01.259
( pants )

21:03.762 --> 21:05.429
What?

21:13.313 --> 21:15.314
( footsteps approaching )

21:21.863 --> 21:24.031
( blows )

21:24.199 --> 21:26.200
What the fuck?

21:30.414 --> 21:32.540
( blows )

21:41.925 --> 21:44.969
What the fuck is this?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.315
( sighs )

21:57.482 --> 21:59.608
( tisks )

21:59.776 --> 22:02.403
Mr. O'Brien.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.656
( sighs )

22:07.576 --> 22:10.786
What do you know
about your friend in your cell?

22:10.954 --> 22:12.705
( Iaughs )
My friend?

22:12.873 --> 22:14.582
Mm-hmm.

22:14.750 --> 22:18.002
Well, he's my long-lost lndian brother.
What do you think?

22:19.671 --> 22:21.339
He attempted
to escape with you.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.882
( snorts )
No.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.218
No, he took me--
he fucking took me hostage.

22:32.225 --> 22:35.853
What was your business, my friend,
with Senor Pedrosa?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.605
- ( panting )
- Hmm?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.316
Look, do you have any charges
to bring against me

22:40.484 --> 22:44.195
or are you just jerking my chain
to justify a day's pay?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.405
Don't talk to me like that, all right,

22:46.573 --> 22:48.366
Mr. Ponytail?
Don't talk to me like that!

22:48.533 --> 22:51.786
The man who was arrested
with you yesterday, my friend,

22:51.953 --> 22:55.414
is the murderer
of Rafael Santos.

22:55.582 --> 22:59.377
( sighs )
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.879
No, l'm not kidding you.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.341
l'm just as interested
in his capture as you are.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.052
( sighs )

23:08.220 --> 23:10.304
Mr.--

23:10.472 --> 23:14.683
Mr. O'Brien, that's unlikely.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.228
You're not cooperating too much.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.398
- What the fuck do you want me to say?
- You know, you're gonna be my guest.

23:20.565 --> 23:23.567
Guard, take him
back to his cell. Now!

23:23.735 --> 23:27.780
You can't fucking do this, man.
l am an American reporter working here.

23:27.948 --> 23:31.742
CaII AIyssa Rothman
with the Rainforest Society.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.203
She's a very good friend of mine.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.373
( sirens blaring )

23:48.510 --> 23:50.511
Djamori?

24:08.822 --> 24:12.575
R.J.: Somebody call
the American ambassador!

24:12.742 --> 24:16.328
l am an innocent American
being heId against my wiII.

24:17.330 --> 24:21.083
Someone caII
the goddamn ambassador!

24:21.251 --> 24:22.877
Hello?!

24:23.044 --> 24:24.587
That's him.

24:24.754 --> 24:28.632
Somebody call the ambassador!

24:29.634 --> 24:32.136
Look, you might as weII
let him go. He's harmless.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.971
Yeah.

24:35.098 --> 24:37.141
- HeIIo!
- Sanchez.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.018
- Sanchez: Si, Mayor.
- Take him out.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.651
R.J.: Alyssa!

25:01.166 --> 25:04.168
( chattering )

25:08.882 --> 25:10.883
Man: Reo.

25:33.156 --> 25:36.283
Take a seat.
Asientos, senores.

25:39.162 --> 25:41.622
Did the suspect
know Santos personally?

25:41.790 --> 25:44.375
l cannot comment
on that question.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.127
Which tribe is he from
and did he have any accomplices?

25:47.295 --> 25:50.130
That wiII come out
of our legal investigation.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.675
Then, what-- what kind of questions
are we supposed to ask?

25:52.842 --> 25:54.802
Do you think
you know why he did it?

25:54.970 --> 25:59.640
His reasons will be brought
to Iight at his triaI,

25:59.808 --> 26:04.979
but in the meantime we have
his fuII signed confession.

26:05.146 --> 26:08.065
( journalists murmuring )

26:08.233 --> 26:09.567
( coughs )
Bullshit.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.655
( coughing )

26:14.823 --> 26:19.326
And solid evidence,
including witnesses,

26:19.494 --> 26:22.454
and everything--
everything to convict him.

26:24.708 --> 26:26.917
What if he was framed?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.588
That's all.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.974
( ballad playing )

26:57.157 --> 26:59.867
( woman moaning )

27:03.955 --> 27:06.957
( louder moaning )

27:15.467 --> 27:17.301
Go.

27:17.469 --> 27:19.428
- ( man moans )
- Yeah.

27:19.596 --> 27:21.722
( moaning continues )

27:21.890 --> 27:25.225
Do it! Whoo! Yeah!

27:26.561 --> 27:27.728
Yeah.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.980
Woman:
 Si! Oh, si.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.982
Whoo!

27:36.071 --> 27:39.073
- ( bed frame squeaking )
- ( rapid moaning )

27:42.077 --> 27:45.329
Woman:
 Ay, mi amor!

27:52.420 --> 27:55.422
( knocks )
Thank you.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.138
AIyssa: Djamori gets
arrested for questioning

28:03.306 --> 28:05.933
and two days later he's dead?
l don't believe this.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.018
lt's true.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.187
But you know exactly
what's gonna happen if--

28:10.355 --> 28:11.897
lf they don't have a trial for this,

28:12.065 --> 28:14.692
They're just gonna conveniently
Iet everything just bIow over.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.903
You're probably right, Alyssa,
but the police seem convinced.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.738
- Oh, the police?
- Mmm.

28:19.906 --> 28:22.866
Since when did you start placing
so much faith in the authorities?

28:23.034 --> 28:25.285
Since l have
a great deal of work to do.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.995
Now why don't you run along

28:27.163 --> 28:30.124
and go find another righteously
indignant souI to rant to?

28:30.291 --> 28:33.585
Well, because l'm not done ranting
to this righteously indignant soul.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.879
- All right.
- ( laughs softly )

28:36.047 --> 28:38.674
Sometimes we have to--
we must work together.

28:38.842 --> 28:42.970
We have to compromise in the interest
of getting something done.

28:43.138 --> 28:44.555
( marmoset chattering )

28:44.723 --> 28:47.975
RafaeI Santos
did not die in vain.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.977
( honks )

29:15.587 --> 29:17.588
R.J.: Ahem.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.592
So are you here to see someone?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.344
Uh, yeah.
Actually, l'm here to see you.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.597
l wanna thank you

29:26.765 --> 29:29.808
and, um, as you can see,
l'm unarmed and l'm not dangerous.

29:29.976 --> 29:34.438
And I just thought maybe
we could talk like good boys and girls.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.647
Okay then.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.357
Let me ask you this.

29:37.525 --> 29:39.985
Why did you follow me
to Lucavida's house?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.738
- l followed you?
- Yes, you did.

29:42.906 --> 29:46.200
And l didn't like it. Father Benacio
caIIed together that meeting

29:46.367 --> 29:49.369
and he did it to bring together
the people at odds over Santos's death

29:49.537 --> 29:51.538
and the people concerned
about the rainforest.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.291
l'm all in favor of proper relations.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.085
Mr. O'Brien,

29:57.253 --> 30:00.631
you have absolutely nothing to say
that holds any interest to me.

30:06.513 --> 30:08.263
Well, l think l do.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.976
I think the guy who's in jaiI
for killing Santos is innocent.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.603
What makes you think that?

30:14.771 --> 30:17.648
Well, it's a gut feeling,
but, uh...

30:17.816 --> 30:19.483
l have some ideas.

30:23.530 --> 30:27.324
Sandra, hi. This is R.J. O'Brien.
You remember meeting him--

30:27.492 --> 30:29.493
l remember him
from Mr. Lucavida's house.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.745
So what brings you here,
Mr. O'Brien?

30:31.913 --> 30:34.331
- Well, actually l was--
- Well, actually-- l'm sorry.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.209
Um, Mr. O'Brien was
in jail with Djamori

30:37.377 --> 30:39.503
and he aIso beIieves
Djamori was framed.

30:39.671 --> 30:42.589
And why do you say that?
Did the lndian say something to you?

30:42.757 --> 30:46.009
WeII no.
He didn't say anything,

30:46.177 --> 30:48.178
but l thought that perhaps
with your connections

30:48.346 --> 30:50.639
that we could get
an interview through the police,

30:50.807 --> 30:53.684
- maybe talk out of his own safety.
- I'm afraid that is not possibIe.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.353
- Why?
- The lndian is dead.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.855
He's dead?

30:58.022 --> 31:01.358
He hanged himself last night
in his cell.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.193
Unbelievable.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.114
What did they do,
slip him a pre-knotted noose?

31:07.282 --> 31:09.032
l agree with him 100%.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.034
l mean, this whole thing
is just way too convenient.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.997
That may very well be,
but who's gonna challenge the police?

31:15.164 --> 31:17.833
l'll challenge the police,
but l've gotta have more information.

31:18.001 --> 31:19.751
l don't know the first thing
about this guy.

31:19.919 --> 31:23.130
Well, what l know is that
he's from the Zingari tribe

31:23.298 --> 31:26.425
and their territory's way up
in the highlands.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.302
WeII, then I guess
an excursion is in order.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.721
l hate to burst your bubble,
Mr. O'Brien,

31:30.889 --> 31:32.723
but you're gonna
be like a flea on a gorilla.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.809
The rainforest is
no place for a gringo.

31:35.977 --> 31:38.145
Well, thanks for the advice.

31:40.648 --> 31:43.817
l guess Santos is gonna become
a worId martyr for this one.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.777
He was a bit of a publicity hound,
wasn't he?

31:45.945 --> 31:47.571
No, not really.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.740
l mean, he just realized
that there was a connection

31:49.908 --> 31:52.826
between the rubber tappers' struggle
to save their way of Iife

31:52.994 --> 31:55.037
and the world's concern
for the ecoIogy.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.747
So the pubIicity
that he generated

31:56.915 --> 31:59.082
was basicaIIy just
to pull the two together.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.501
Mmm, pure at heart.

32:01.669 --> 32:03.921
- No!
- What?

32:04.088 --> 32:06.423
Alyssa: No, they're not supposed
to be burning out here.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.761
 Alto!  Alto!

32:10.929 --> 32:13.347
-  Alto!
- Watch out, watch out, watch out!

32:14.349 --> 32:16.224
 Ayudame!
( continues in Spanish )

32:16.392 --> 32:18.268
- What's going on?
- Somebody set her house on fire

32:18.436 --> 32:20.228
and her son's still inside.

32:29.530 --> 32:32.282
Wait. Wait!

33:12.115 --> 33:14.157
( groans )
Shit.

33:14.325 --> 33:16.159
-  Como se llama?
- Antonio.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.286
Alyssa: Antonio.
Come on, Antonio. Come on, baby.

33:18.454 --> 33:22.040
Come on, come on! Come on!
Come on, Antonio. Breathe! Come on!

33:28.006 --> 33:29.923
- Come on.
- ( woman crying )

33:30.091 --> 33:32.300
Come on, come on, come on.

33:32.468 --> 33:35.387
Come on, come on.
Come on, breathe. Come on.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.519
( crying )

33:44.897 --> 33:48.734
Come on! Come on, breathe!
Do you hear me?! Come on.

33:48.901 --> 33:52.154
- Come on, please! Oh God.
- ( both crying )

33:52.321 --> 33:55.198
Come on, come on,
come on, please.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.743
Please please please.

33:57.910 --> 34:01.079
( Antonio coughing )

34:07.879 --> 34:10.880
( speaking Spanish )

34:15.762 --> 34:18.764
( crying )

34:22.226 --> 34:24.853
lt's all right.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.982
lt's okay.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.752
There he is right there. See?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.379
Let's wait for the police to leave.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.103
Adelante.

36:00.491 --> 36:04.286
Ataninde,
un momento por favor.

36:04.453 --> 36:07.330
My name is Alyssa Rothman.
We met at Lucavida's.

36:07.498 --> 36:10.250
l'm with the Rainforest Society,
and we wouId very much Iike

36:10.418 --> 36:12.711
- to speak to you about Djamori.
- I was the one

36:12.879 --> 36:17.340
who was arrested with Djamori.
I don't think he kiIIed Santos.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.266
Ahem. Um,

36:26.434 --> 36:28.935
can l ask you a few questions?

36:29.103 --> 36:31.938
Uh, excuse me.
l'm trying to help!

36:32.106 --> 36:34.774
No--  no escuchas?

36:34.942 --> 36:37.360
l'm trying to help.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.198
Scratch that idea.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.868
( sighs )

36:45.036 --> 36:47.746
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

36:47.914 --> 36:49.873
Come on,
we're following him.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.541
We're-- no, we're not.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.793
- This is no time to give up.
- l'm not giving up.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.880
I just don't think it's right
that you go follow him-- hey!

36:57.924 --> 37:00.967
- Sorry.
- Asshole.

37:54.522 --> 37:57.315
( pants )
Where in the hell is it?

37:57.483 --> 38:01.361
Alyssa: l have no idea.
Santos said he was there once,

38:01.529 --> 38:04.656
but the only thing he said was
that it was a Iong trip.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.879
 Nos estan siguiendo?

38:20.047 --> 38:22.549
Si. Ahi estan.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.383
( groans softly )

39:05.551 --> 39:08.553
( footsteps )

39:11.015 --> 39:14.017
lt looks like we're up the creek
in more ways than one.

39:15.019 --> 39:17.020
Son of a bitch!

39:22.526 --> 39:25.528
- ( groans )
- Shh. Shh-shh!

39:27.406 --> 39:30.033
- What?
- Quiet. Be quiet.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.371
( rustling )

39:38.876 --> 39:41.086
l just heard something.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.388
( gunshot )

40:01.232 --> 40:03.942
( gunshots )

40:21.794 --> 40:24.129
( gunshot )

40:37.268 --> 40:40.728
( Alyssa chokes, coughing )

40:44.316 --> 40:48.111
Shh. Shh.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.997
What the hell.
( grunts )

40:59.165 --> 41:01.166
Ow.

41:12.678 --> 41:15.680
( groaning )

41:17.183 --> 41:19.309
( motor whirring )

41:20.978 --> 41:23.480
- ( mumbles )
- ( gasps )

41:23.647 --> 41:25.815
- God.
- ( groaning )

41:30.905 --> 41:34.240
You're lucky it didn't go
through the bone.

41:35.242 --> 41:37.994
( whimpers, mumbles )
l am really scared.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.663
Look,

41:40.831 --> 41:43.666
those lndians
didn't have any guns.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.628
Whoever shot us
came from back there.

41:46.795 --> 41:49.214
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry, l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.700
The Zingari territorial boundaries.

42:17.868 --> 42:20.245
See?

42:26.168 --> 42:28.211
Come on.

42:32.383 --> 42:35.552
( squeals )

43:01.745 --> 43:03.121
( both whispering )

43:03.289 --> 43:05.415
Shh.

43:05.583 --> 43:08.001
( rustling )

43:13.424 --> 43:15.300
Right.

43:23.267 --> 43:26.227
( panting )

43:28.314 --> 43:30.565
l think we lost them.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.942
All right, you wait here.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.194
- l'm gonna see if l can find the river.
- No. No, l don't--

43:35.362 --> 43:37.655
Just wait here one second!

43:48.000 --> 43:49.834
God.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.774
( muffled screams )

44:25.704 --> 44:28.831
- ( groans )
- Why are you following me?

44:28.999 --> 44:30.833
Hmm?

44:31.001 --> 44:33.586
This is my territory.

44:34.755 --> 44:37.965
You could've saved me a trip if you'd
answered my questions about Djamori.

44:38.133 --> 44:41.302
Djamori was killed
by a white man and l can kill you

44:41.470 --> 44:45.014
whenever l fucking want to.

44:48.811 --> 44:50.645
( shouts )

44:50.813 --> 44:52.146
 Camina!

45:08.706 --> 45:10.832
( chattering )

45:10.999 --> 45:14.001
( thunder rumbling )

45:45.242 --> 45:48.244
( thundering intensifies )

45:55.252 --> 45:57.754
Hold on.

45:57.921 --> 45:59.922
Please, his shoulder
has been hurt.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.341
Is there anything
that you can give him for it?

46:04.845 --> 46:06.387
Si.

46:06.555 --> 46:08.598
R.J.:
You know Djamori.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.767
Do you think he killed Santos?

46:10.934 --> 46:14.896
Yeah, he could have done it, maybe not.

46:15.063 --> 46:16.689
But either way, he's dead.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.733
Yeah, but if we don't
find out the truth,

46:18.901 --> 46:21.486
more people are just gonna
keep getting kiIIed.

46:21.653 --> 46:24.363
l don't believe
the white man's truth anymore.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.577
Toma.

46:36.668 --> 46:38.836
( groans softly )

46:48.472 --> 46:51.307
l can't believe
l've lost my fucking camera!

46:51.475 --> 46:53.351
You didn't.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.520
lt's right here.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.816
You are quite the Girl Scout,
aren't you?

46:59.983 --> 47:02.527
Brownie.

47:17.501 --> 47:19.794
Bring the prisoner.

47:29.054 --> 47:31.013
Two blows to the head,

47:31.181 --> 47:34.100
covered up with false hair.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.396
But what killed him was the blow
to the back.

47:38.564 --> 47:41.190
He burst his kidneys.

47:42.359 --> 47:45.194
White man's truth.

47:45.362 --> 47:47.613
l'm sorry.

47:50.284 --> 47:53.578
I'd Iike to take some pictures.
l'd like to prove he didn't kill himself.

48:06.091 --> 48:07.925
( shutter clicking )

48:43.795 --> 48:45.463
Did you know Rafael?

48:46.465 --> 48:49.926
l spent five years working
outside the reservation

48:50.093 --> 48:52.303
for the government,
for the Zingari tribe.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.013
That's when l met Santos.

48:54.181 --> 48:56.307
You were his partner, right?

48:57.726 --> 49:00.102
He knew how to use the law
to protect the lndians

49:00.270 --> 49:02.355
and the rubber tappers.

49:02.522 --> 49:05.274
l know how to protect
the movement from outside threats.

49:05.442 --> 49:07.109
And?

49:07.277 --> 49:08.861
And he failed.

49:09.029 --> 49:10.613
He died.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.782
He failed before he died,

49:12.950 --> 49:16.202
when he decided to fight
the exploiters with empathy--

49:16.370 --> 49:19.121
passive resistance bullshit.

49:19.289 --> 49:23.125
Well, it seemed to work
aII right for Gandhi.

49:30.550 --> 49:34.053
You don't happen to know who
might've put this hole in me, do you?

49:34.221 --> 49:37.640
There's a lot of fools
Iooking for goId.

49:41.687 --> 49:44.689
( tribal music playing )

49:52.823 --> 49:55.992
( speaking native language )

50:00.288 --> 50:02.957
( speaks native language )

51:13.779 --> 51:16.530
( thunder rumbles )

51:16.698 --> 51:19.700
( rain pattering )

51:23.371 --> 51:25.790
( instrumental music playing )

51:39.930 --> 51:43.265
( hissing )

51:51.775 --> 51:54.652
- ( hissing continues )
- ( roars )

52:00.784 --> 52:02.952
( roars )

53:34.669 --> 53:37.087
( sniffs )

53:37.255 --> 53:39.924
( groans softly )

53:46.598 --> 53:49.225
You stole the blankets!

53:51.811 --> 53:54.563
lt's the middle of the night.
Come back to bed.

54:02.697 --> 54:04.365
We are so different.

54:04.532 --> 54:07.910
You're here for a story

54:08.078 --> 54:09.912
and l'm here because l care.

54:10.080 --> 54:15.709
l bet if all the logging
and all the burning stopped tomorrow,

54:15.877 --> 54:18.879
you'd find another cause.

54:19.047 --> 54:21.924
And l guess you don't hold
anything sacred, huh?

54:22.092 --> 54:24.760
l guess you've just seen
so much in this worId

54:24.928 --> 54:27.096
that you've deveIoped
this profound philosophy

54:27.264 --> 54:29.932
that there's nothing worth
caring about. Is that it?

54:30.100 --> 54:32.142
No.

54:32.310 --> 54:35.854
- l don't care about a lot.
- Mmm?

54:43.530 --> 54:45.990
l care about you.

54:47.158 --> 54:48.867
You don't know me.

54:49.035 --> 54:51.287
No, but l want to.

55:17.147 --> 55:19.481
Good morning.

55:19.649 --> 55:21.567
Thank you for the ride back.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.320
We probably wouldn't have found
our way by ourseIves.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.161
- Morning.
- Come on.

55:34.497 --> 55:36.290
( mumbles )

55:55.101 --> 55:57.603
Hey, you wanna have a little drink
before we part company?

55:57.771 --> 55:59.480
l don't think so.

56:04.569 --> 56:08.197
Ataninde, please, do you have
any idea who killed them?

56:09.741 --> 56:12.701
Santos had many enemies.

56:12.869 --> 56:15.204
lt could have been anyone.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.585
Yeah. Well, the arrow indicates
that it was an Indian.

56:23.296 --> 56:26.548
Appearances can be deceiving,
Mr. Magazine Writer.

56:26.716 --> 56:29.510
You shouId know that.
You write the truth every day.

56:36.684 --> 56:40.104
Where-- do you know
where we can get this film developed?

56:40.271 --> 56:42.564
Yeah, we have a makeshift
Iab at the office

56:42.732 --> 56:45.234
that we use for our newsletter.

56:45.402 --> 56:48.195
Oh, God, you're so beautiful
when you say that.

56:49.197 --> 56:53.033
Do women in New York
actually fall for these lines?

56:53.201 --> 56:55.744
All the time.

56:55.912 --> 56:59.790
Funny.
lt sounds pretty cliche to me.

57:01.126 --> 57:04.128
( music playing )

57:16.266 --> 57:18.934
Alyssa:
Can l come in?

57:20.437 --> 57:24.481
l've been trying to get ahold of Sandra,
but I can't find her anywhere.

57:25.942 --> 57:27.818
So how is it going?

57:27.986 --> 57:30.112
Really good.

57:37.495 --> 57:39.746
These are beautiful!

57:42.417 --> 57:45.002
Are you gonna use
all of these in your article?

57:45.170 --> 57:46.962
You can bet
your sweet ass l am.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.590
( laughs )
You are so charming.

57:50.884 --> 57:53.010
That's great.

57:54.012 --> 57:57.306
- l meant it affectionately.
- ( laughs )

57:57.474 --> 57:59.141
Oh.

58:00.435 --> 58:03.187
Alyssa: We have work to do.
( laughs )

58:18.661 --> 58:20.787
( groans )

58:27.837 --> 58:29.713
( laughs )

58:29.881 --> 58:32.216
- Perdon.
- Perdon.

58:33.510 --> 58:36.261
Oh-oh-oh, shoot shoot,
I have to caII Sandra.

58:36.429 --> 58:39.014
- Now?
- Yes, now. Just real fast.

58:39.182 --> 58:41.892
- Shall l get horizontal or--
- Yes, you shouId.

58:42.060 --> 58:44.061
- ( laughs )
- 213.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.777
  l cannot see

58:51.945 --> 58:55.030
  Why do you want me?

58:55.198 --> 58:57.199
  Yeah.

59:00.411 --> 59:03.205
  l cannot see

59:03.373 --> 59:07.042
  Why you look so...

59:07.210 --> 59:09.002
Mmm.

59:09.170 --> 59:11.046
  Want me?

59:12.298 --> 59:15.175
Don't move.

59:19.722 --> 59:23.058
You should have left
after the funeral

59:23.226 --> 59:25.477
like your friends.

59:27.564 --> 59:30.524
This is none of your business.

59:32.944 --> 59:34.945
Tie him up.

59:36.114 --> 59:37.864
( panting )

59:40.910 --> 59:42.578
Listen, we can--

59:42.745 --> 59:45.122
we can make a deal here.

59:45.290 --> 59:48.917
Uh, you can have the pictures
as far as l'm concerned.

59:49.085 --> 59:51.420
l'll get out of this fucking country
anyway. Your food sucks!

59:51.588 --> 59:53.797
- ( phone rings )
- HeIIo?

59:53.965 --> 59:55.507
Hi. lt's me Alyssa.

59:55.675 --> 59:59.219
We just got back and R.J. managed
to get ahoId of some information

59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.513
that proves that Djamori
didn't kiII himseIf.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.599
You know,

01:00:03.766 --> 01:00:06.435
I was getting ready
to arrest you myself,

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:11.440
but apparentIy some fucking
drug dealer got you before l did.

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.775
( tisks )

01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:15.902
l don't like you.

01:00:16.070 --> 01:00:17.863
( pants )
Listen, this isn't that important to me.

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.906
- l wanna get the fuck--
- l don't like you!

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:24.745
l never liked you.

01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:28.373
l don't like this fucking ponytail!

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:29.708
l don't like it!

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.501
Fuck you.

01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.797
Don't ever talk to me
like that, gringo maricon.

01:00:35.965 --> 01:00:40.385
- ( grunts, groaning )
- Don't forget! Never.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.392
Alyssa, where are you?

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.102
l'm calling from his hotel.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:50.479
( whispers )
His hotel.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.564
AIyssa, do me a favor
and come to the office.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:54.816
You get to the office right away, okay?
I'II meet you there.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:57.444
- l wanna hear more about this.
- But this is good news, isn't it?

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:00.489
lt's great news. l just don't wanna
discuss it on the phone.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.699
Now go to the office.

01:01:02.867 --> 01:01:05.452
Okay, l'll be right there.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.162
Bye.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.497
Shoot.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.667
( panting )

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:14.044
( muffled groans )

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:20.050
( gagging, breathing heavily )

01:01:30.728 --> 01:01:33.355
( bomb ticking )

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.651
Good luck.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:56.837
( groaning )

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:10.142
( muffled scream )

01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:14.563
- Alyssa: R.J., come on, open up.
- ( chair tapping )

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:17.566
What are you doing?
Come on, open the door.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.402
( groaning )

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.657
( knocks )
R.J., are you all right?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.201
- ( groaning continues )
- Come on.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.245
R.J., are you all right?

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.373
- ( doorknob rattling )
- Jesus.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.086
Oh my God.

01:02:39.714 --> 01:02:41.298
- Move!
- l'm trying.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.967
l'm trying.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:45.802
Let me get this.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.098
Come on!

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:00.025
( people screaming )

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.951
( tires screeching )

01:03:10.119 --> 01:03:11.578
Who would do--
who did this?

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:14.498
Valdez and a bunch
of fucking cops!

01:03:14.665 --> 01:03:15.999
Valdez?

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.341
And now what the fuck
are we gonna do?

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:27.135
All right. Let's go back to my office.
Sandra will know what to do.

01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:30.138
Yeah? Well, we need somebody
who is not afraid of the cops.

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.973
Well, believe me, Sandra is not.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:35.310
Fuck! Unbe-fucking-lievable!

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.979
( honks )

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.822
- Oh my God, wait. Wait wait wait.
- What?

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:49.741
- Oh Jesus.
- What?

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.369
Sandra knew about the bomb
in your room.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.996
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:58.625
lt's just the way that she was reacting
when l was talking to her on the phone.

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:02.170
Are you sure you're not reading
something into this

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.089
because this is our last chance?

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.758
l don't know.

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:20.063
( hinges squeal )

01:04:35.454 --> 01:04:37.998
You were right.

01:04:38.165 --> 01:04:41.251
Lucavida is paying everybody,
incIuding your boss Sandra.

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:45.422
- ( siren blaring )
- ( siIent )

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.260
( shouts )

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.354
- Ataninde, please listen to me.
- Enough.

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.565
No! Ataninde, no.
l will not shut up, okay?

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.526
Listen to me. Listen to me, okay?
There's no place else that we can turn.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.904
- And we need your help, all right?
- R.J.: AII right, Iisten.

01:05:09.071 --> 01:05:12.407
They're aII in this together. Lucavida
is financing the whole forest operation.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:14.409
( speaks Spanish )

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:17.162
What does that gotta do with me?

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:21.625
So you're saying that Santos'
death's got nothing to do with you

01:05:21.792 --> 01:05:24.044
and that Djamori's death
got nothing to do with you?

01:05:24.211 --> 01:05:26.922
Look, you white people
mind your own business,

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:28.757
and I'II take care
of my people, okay?

01:05:33.512 --> 01:05:37.015
Don't you realize
we're on the same freaking side?

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:40.226
Can you hear me?

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:44.940
You know, you're a fucking hypocrite,
you know that?

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.695
-  Concha su fucking madre!
- Alyssa: Stop it, okay?

01:05:50.863 --> 01:05:52.656
- Just take it easy.
- Shit!

01:05:52.823 --> 01:05:55.575
Calm down.
Calm down, all right?

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.037
You guys are going too far.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:02.415
You are both
responsible for this.

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.627
lt has cost us a lot of money.

01:06:05.795 --> 01:06:07.629
I think I know
where they might be.

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:11.132
- l'll get the bastard.
- No more vioIence.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.219
Senor VaIdez, wouId you mind
waiting outside for me, please?

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.513
Why not?

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:19.641
And you listen to me.

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:23.603
l've done my best for you,
but I cannot--

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.981
lt's yourjob.

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.775
Just do it, hmm?

01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:38.785
Nacia:
Tell him to bring more if he can.

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:42.288
Yes, as soon as possible. Okay.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.835
Some of them already left.

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.712
A lot of good it's gonna do us.

01:06:48.879 --> 01:06:51.506
- At Ieast they wiII protect you.
- What we need right now is a plane,

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:54.092
not a protest movement.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:57.429
Holy fuck!

01:06:57.596 --> 01:07:00.140
- Damn it!
- What?

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:02.851
I had Chato's number
the whole goddamned time.

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:05.687
- He's got a plane.
- Who's this Chato?

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:08.523
( phone ringing )

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.444
- Yeah. Hello.
- R.J.: Chato?

01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.530
- Chato, it's R.J.
- Oh, how are you, my friend?

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:17.615
- Where you been?
- Listen, man, straighten up.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:19.868
This is some serious shit,
all right?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.537
I need to get a pIane
out of here right now.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.456
No no, l can't--
l can't do it, man.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:26.791
Man, there are people
trying to kill me.

01:07:26.959 --> 01:07:28.710
( softly )
l'm tied up at this moment.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.880
Chato, Iisten to me,
this is no fucking joke!

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:36.051
All right? And my life is
on the line here. l need your help.

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:39.971
Okay okay. l meet you
at the embarcadero in Bella Vista.

01:07:48.981 --> 01:07:50.732
Remember, Bella Vista.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:55.111
Don't move!
Don't fucking move.

01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:58.406
( speaking Spanish )

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:01.076

- You two, sit! You two, sit!

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:04.245
- ( speaking Spanish )
- Alyssa: Get off of me.

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:07.165
She doesn't know a fucking thing.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.750
lt's you who we want.

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.752
- The embassy knows every fucking thing.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.170
God damn you, pig!

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.546
Do you like that?

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:14.798
- Good.
- The fucking embassy.

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:21.970
Take him away.

01:08:22.139 --> 01:08:24.182
The embassy!

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:28.353
Don't try anything.
l'll blow his brains out.

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:38.571
The American embassy knows everything.
You guys are in deep shit.

01:08:40.073 --> 01:08:42.951
AII right, aII right,
this is a police matter!

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:45.453
And anyone-- anyone--

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.622
who tries to interfere
will be arrested.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.792
Now move!

01:08:54.212 --> 01:08:56.339
You don't hear me? Get out!

 Camina!  Camina!  Camina!

01:09:11.104 --> 01:09:13.689

Alyssa, get out of the line.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.601

We are not moving!

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:41.819
Do you wanna die, bitch?
Is that what you want?

01:10:41.987 --> 01:10:44.489

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:04.355
Where are you going?

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.024
If you go back there,

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.406
Crazy fucking lndian.

01:14:36.263 --> 01:14:38.431
Come on, hurry up!

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:41.184
Forget about him. He's dead.

Okay, buddy,

01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:58.951

We're going home now.

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:33.027
What?

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:36.531
Write about what you feel,

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.033

l'm sorry, my friend.

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:29.959

  With you, l understand

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:54.609
  What words cannot explain

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.737
  Just the touch of your love

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.804
  Where no one knows

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:27.308
  The look on my face

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:31.812
  OnIy you see

01:17:36.401 --> 01:17:40.738
  Where children can be free

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.990
  Where l found you

01:17:43.158 --> 01:17:46.035
  And you found me
