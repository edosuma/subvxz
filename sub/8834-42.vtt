[Rebecca Cunningham] I remember
Christmas when I was a little girl.

01:13.125 --> 01:18.333
I remember the lights,
the toys, the candy,

01:18.625 --> 01:21.625
but most of all,
I remember the snow. [sighs]

01:22.667 --> 01:24.166
You know, Molly,

01:24.250 --> 01:28.125
that's what I'd really like for Christmas,

01:28.208 --> 01:30.542
to see it snow.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.291
[Molly] Christmas isn't for two days.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.917
Maybe we'll get some.

01:35.458 --> 01:39.083
It never snows in Cape Suzette.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.917
I'm off to shop till I drop.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.125
Be good. Remember,
Santa's checking his list.

01:44.375 --> 01:45.834
[Baloo] [chuckles] Later, Becky.

01:45.917 --> 01:47.458
Bye, Mom.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.000
[Wildcat] Hey, Baloo, check it out.

01:53.709 --> 01:56.041
Now that's what I like to see--

01:58.125 --> 02:00.792
A guy who gets into his work.

02:01.959 --> 02:03.000
Hi, pumpkin.

02:03.083 --> 02:04.625
Going to help us decorate?

02:04.834 --> 02:06.875
Nope, writing Santa.

02:06.959 --> 02:10.583
You already sent him one.
No fair writing two.

02:10.667 --> 02:14.375
[Molly] This is a special-delivery
emergency letter.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.583
My last candy cane!

02:17.667 --> 02:22.375
Well now, we might be able to do
something about this.

02:22.625 --> 02:25.375
Hmm...

02:25.458 --> 02:26.458
Yep.

02:27.125 --> 02:29.583
This is the one to put under your pillow.

02:29.792 --> 02:30.917
What for?

02:31.166 --> 02:32.917
For the Peppermint Fairy.

02:33.417 --> 02:35.000
Oh, Baloo.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.166
You've heard of the tooth fairy.

02:37.500 --> 02:39.458
Well, this is her cousin.

02:39.542 --> 02:40.500
Really?

02:40.667 --> 02:42.500
Wow! Thanks, Baloo.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.125
Better remember to slip a candy cane
under her pillow tonight.

02:51.875 --> 02:54.208
[cock-a-doodle-do]

02:55.500 --> 02:56.583
[Rebecca Cunningham] Wake up, Baloo.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.125
It's an emergency.

02:58.208 --> 03:00.125
What? What?

03:00.208 --> 03:02.083
The store gave me the wrong present.

03:02.166 --> 03:05.166
I wanted a nutcracker,
not a vegetable slicer.

03:05.333 --> 03:09.500
Get that soap shipment loaded
and watch Molly.

03:09.750 --> 03:14.125
Load Molly on the plane-- [mumbles]

03:17.834 --> 03:18.750
Molly!

03:19.959 --> 03:22.542
Oh! Candy cane! Candy cane!

03:22.917 --> 03:24.375
Don't tell me you forgot.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.041
[Baloo] Peppermint Fairy to the rescue!

03:43.291 --> 03:46.709
Did the Peppermint Fairy forget something?

03:46.792 --> 03:48.041
Oh, hi.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.959
The Peppermint Fairy told me to--

03:51.333 --> 03:53.000
There's no Peppermint Fairy.

03:53.083 --> 03:54.917
You lied to a little kid.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.792
I was only trying--

03:56.875 --> 04:01.000
I bet that Santa stuff is baloney, too.

04:01.083 --> 04:04.500
Oh, no, Molly, Santa hates baloney.

04:04.583 --> 04:08.000
How can I write Santa
if there is no Santa?

04:08.583 --> 04:10.417
Now, wait a minute.

04:14.041 --> 04:17.208
Of course there's a Santa Claus.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.208
Yeah? Prove it.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.375
OK, I will.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.709
I'm flying you to the North Pole.

04:23.792 --> 04:26.417
You can give your letter
to Santa in person.

04:26.875 --> 04:27.792
Really?

04:28.333 --> 04:31.041
Really. Get your coat on.
We got to hurry...

04:31.250 --> 04:33.041
Before Rebecca gets back.

04:33.375 --> 04:35.041
What are you doing?

04:35.500 --> 04:37.834
Don't worry, Kit. Papa Bear's got a plan.

04:40.917 --> 04:43.000
[Louie] Louie's place. It's your dime.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.500
Why, deck the halls, it's Baloo.

04:46.125 --> 04:48.917
Of course I know it's Christmas.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.500
Sure, I'll do you a favor.
What have you got?

04:53.083 --> 04:55.458
You want me to dress up as <i>who?</i>

05:01.959 --> 05:04.083
[Wildcat] OK, Mr. Soap flakes,

05:04.166 --> 05:06.959
you're going on a big trip.

05:09.083 --> 05:11.709
[Baloo] Sorry, Wildcat, no time for cargo.

05:11.792 --> 05:13.417
We're taking off.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.333
[Wildcat] You really are
going to the north pole?

05:17.625 --> 05:18.583
Yep.

05:18.667 --> 05:22.208
I'll put in a good word
for you with Santa.

05:22.291 --> 05:26.667
That's great, but take me.
I won't say anything.

05:26.792 --> 05:30.458
I'll sit quietly.
I'll be quiet in the backseat.

05:31.834 --> 05:33.291
[birds calling]

05:36.208 --> 05:37.166
[Molly] Can I look yet?

05:37.417 --> 05:38.375
Not yet.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.291
You'll spoil the surprise.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.250
Who's there?

05:45.709 --> 05:47.667

05:47.750 --> 05:49.667
Well, come right in.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.041
Wow!

05:59.709 --> 06:01.291

06:04.959 --> 06:06.959
