00:03.836 --> 00:05.503
Okay, dude,
this is not worth it.

00:05.578 --> 00:06.789
This is sick.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.575
Like disgusting sick,
not <i> sick</i> sick.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.210
Yo, pull it together, man.

00:10.245 --> 00:12.378
We can't keep letting Cooper
get the better of us.

00:12.414 --> 00:13.651
Look what he did to your hair.

00:13.699 --> 00:15.074
You look like a human
whoopee cushion.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.425
Now hurry it up.
The garbage truck's

00:16.449 --> 00:17.917
gonna be here in,
like, 15 minutes.

00:18.229 --> 00:20.053
Oh, man.

00:20.784 --> 00:22.276
Oh, this is gnarly.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.222
Yes. That is
definitely a keeper.

00:24.377 --> 00:25.948
Yeah, imagine the look on
the Coop's face when he

00:25.972 --> 00:28.386
opens his car
and all these guts spill out.

00:29.736 --> 00:31.569
Dude, what do you think
this is from?

00:31.660 --> 00:32.917
Uh, mountain lion, probably.

00:32.964 --> 00:35.417
Oh, yeah.

00:35.933 --> 00:37.167
What about this?

00:37.256 --> 00:39.323
Cobra.

00:41.273 --> 00:42.605
Gross.

00:43.081 --> 00:45.241
Dude, what about this?

00:50.731 --> 00:53.832
Get out of here!
Go!

00:57.589 --> 01:00.572
I'm never riding a bike again.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.401
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Christine, is everything...?

01:02.425 --> 01:04.655
- Wow, wow, okay.
- What happened?

01:04.691 --> 01:06.468
Look, I was teaching her
how to ride a bike, okay?

01:06.492 --> 01:08.492
And she was doing really
great. She was...

01:08.516 --> 01:11.346
A little wobbly at first,
and then I just

01:11.394 --> 01:14.081
kind of let her go
and then, bam... hit the ground.

01:14.167 --> 01:16.919
Booth, I-I don't want Christine
riding a bicycle

01:16.997 --> 01:20.705
until I can properly
teach her about the physics.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.980
What physics?
What are you talking about, huh?

01:23.028 --> 01:24.246
Physics. You get on,

01:24.294 --> 01:26.714
fall off, you figure it
out, you get back on.

01:26.762 --> 01:29.558
What physics?
Gyroscopic forces,

01:29.606 --> 01:32.575
acceleration
due to gravity, friction.

01:32.623 --> 01:33.684
"Friction"?

01:33.755 --> 01:35.895
Don't you think
that it's-it's good

01:35.950 --> 01:38.348
to not know how something works?

01:38.405 --> 01:40.684
I mean, come on, science takes
the magic out of everything.

01:40.708 --> 01:42.130
There's no magic to begin with.

01:42.223 --> 01:45.144
It's just rules that govern the universe.
Next thing you know

01:45.192 --> 01:46.309
you're gonna be telling her that 
rainbows are...

01:46.356 --> 01:47.652
light refracted through water?

01:47.653 --> 01:49.614
She already knows that.
Of course she does.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.130
Now that Christine's
had some time to self-soothe,

01:52.200 --> 01:53.919
I'm going to go check in on her.

01:54.403 --> 01:55.554
Oh...

01:55.589 --> 01:56.688
Oh.

01:56.805 --> 01:58.239
Yeah, all right, well, I guess

01:58.287 --> 02:00.191
we're going to work,
because there's a body...

02:00.239 --> 02:02.458
Ooh, found in a dumpster
full of animal guts?

02:02.506 --> 02:04.763
That's your territory.
It'll be fascinating

02:04.798 --> 02:07.457
to see how non-human viscera

02:07.505 --> 02:09.175
effects the decomposition

02:09.223 --> 02:11.005
of a human corpse.

02:11.184 --> 02:13.497
There goes my appetite.
You'd think after 12 years

02:13.590 --> 02:16.278
you could handle a little
viscera with your oatmeal.

02:19.379 --> 02:22.411
Three dumpsters filled
with entrails and fluid.

02:22.459 --> 02:24.616
Aren't these bags
not supposed to leak?

02:24.651 --> 02:27.512
Look. Cam?

02:27.911 --> 02:31.156
No. No, that would be
the liver of a moose.

02:31.191 --> 02:32.528
Damn it!

02:32.576 --> 02:33.770
Yeah.

02:33.871 --> 02:35.793
Hey, good try, though, you know?

02:35.879 --> 02:37.028
Maybe next time.

02:37.176 --> 02:39.058
Yeah?
You want to take my place?

02:39.106 --> 02:40.365
I would, but unfortunately

02:40.400 --> 02:42.167
they haven't, you know, invented

02:42.202 --> 02:44.754
a specialized wheelchair
for intestine diving.

02:44.824 --> 02:46.171
- Yeah.
- Dr. hodgins?

02:46.206 --> 02:47.238
Yeah?

02:47.274 --> 02:48.506
Have you found time of death?

02:48.542 --> 02:50.475
No. No, not even close.

02:50.510 --> 02:51.843
No, this pool
of carcasses is like

02:51.878 --> 02:53.778
Christmas to carrion feeders,
you know?

02:53.814 --> 02:55.258
They hopped around,
so it's close to impossible

02:55.282 --> 02:57.048
to figure out
when or where they started.

02:57.084 --> 03:00.251
Yes! I found a human humerus.

03:00.287 --> 03:01.887
Part of one.
Mm.

03:01.935 --> 03:05.572
Well, based on the head diameter
and cortical involution,

03:05.634 --> 03:07.361
I'd say the victim is female,

03:07.409 --> 03:08.460
mid-40's.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.295
Oh, my God.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.298
This is disgusting.

03:12.386 --> 03:13.579
Do we have the skull?

03:13.627 --> 03:15.228
Oh, hey, Rodolfo?

03:15.335 --> 03:17.469
Gonna need
to find the skull asap.

03:17.504 --> 03:19.170
As we all know,

03:19.206 --> 03:21.706
skulls don't float, so...

03:23.113 --> 03:25.090
No.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.684
Angie, here, techs found this

03:32.719 --> 03:35.153
for you at the scene.

03:37.024 --> 03:39.691
What?
I'm having too much fun.

03:39.726 --> 03:42.088
I hope you're still having fun
when you're in hell.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.829
Ten more minutes, okay?

03:44.865 --> 03:46.439
Oh!

03:46.556 --> 03:48.619
I can smell it through my mask.

03:49.203 --> 03:51.169
This is so disgusting.

03:53.532 --> 03:56.099
I'll give you five.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:27.218 --> 04:30.154
Oh, what's that?
Yes, I did fish

04:30.202 --> 04:32.107
every last bone
out of the carcass pit.

04:32.155 --> 04:33.607
Are you looking for praise

04:33.655 --> 04:35.467
for performing
the most basic tasks?

04:35.515 --> 04:37.903
I... I was just pointing it out.

04:37.951 --> 04:40.109
Do we have any idea about the...

04:40.157 --> 04:43.029
- Sock, I guess?
- Yeah, it's made of chain metal.

04:43.077 --> 04:44.677
It's the only
article of clothing I found

04:44.724 --> 04:46.090
in the entire dumpster.

04:46.192 --> 04:48.198
So we're looking for
some sort of knight.

04:48.253 --> 04:49.518
Do knights play Golf?

04:49.566 --> 04:50.612
Look, take a look

04:50.660 --> 04:52.565
at the fracture to the hamulus.

04:52.658 --> 04:55.059
It's called a Golfer's fracture,
i believe.

04:55.385 --> 04:57.987
Dr. Fuentes is correct.
This fracture is

04:58.035 --> 04:59.720
extremely common in Golfers.

04:59.768 --> 05:03.241
The result of years of stress
on the wrist.

05:03.343 --> 05:05.576
This body just keeps getting
weirder by the second.

05:05.679 --> 05:07.945
Uh, it gets even weirder.

05:08.048 --> 05:09.781
In the victim's sinuses
alone I pulled out

05:09.883 --> 05:12.003
spores from six species of tree
from around the world,

05:12.085 --> 05:14.319
including dacrydium cupressinum,

05:14.421 --> 05:16.154
which only grows in New Zealand.

05:16.256 --> 05:17.601
So we're looking for

05:17.697 --> 05:19.163
a well-traveled knight

05:19.272 --> 05:22.554
with a love for America's
favorite pastime, Golf.

05:22.981 --> 05:25.077
Just a working theory.

05:28.968 --> 05:30.635
You building a bike?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.913
I wish.
No, this is how Bones wants me

05:32.984 --> 05:35.106
to teach Christine
how to ride a bike.

05:35.208 --> 05:37.163
- Kind of ruins the fun.
- Exactly, right?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.592
So, what do you have for me?

05:38.640 --> 05:41.312
Yeah, uh, so, Angela
sent over the victim's I.D.,

05:41.414 --> 05:43.448
Phyllis Paul. She was
reported missing on Tuesday

05:43.496 --> 05:45.583
by her live-in girlfriend,
Nancy Alpert.

05:45.685 --> 05:47.632
Huh. Phyllis Paul.

05:47.913 --> 05:50.405
College Golfer,
competed professionally.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.684
Yeah, but she never Came close

05:51.710 --> 05:53.590
to winning a competition.
For the past ten years

05:53.678 --> 05:56.212
she taught private Golf lessons.
I sent you her web site.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.448
Oh, thanks, Aubrey.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.624
All right, well,
i tell you what, let's, uh,

06:00.695 --> 06:02.939
bring her girlfriend in.
We can, uh, talk to her.

06:02.988 --> 06:06.756
"Trail equals wheel radius

06:06.858 --> 06:10.393
times cosine of head
angle minus rake"?

06:10.487 --> 06:13.355
- What is this?
- It's-it's a disaster. It's a mess.

06:13.465 --> 06:15.665
I know that this is difficult,

06:15.767 --> 06:18.568
Ms. Alpert, but
can you tell me

06:18.670 --> 06:21.404
the last time that
you saw Phyllis?

06:21.506 --> 06:23.473
Tuesday morning.
She left for the second day

06:23.551 --> 06:25.985
of her competition and she
never Came home that night.

06:26.087 --> 06:27.954
Okay, she was in
a Golf tournament?

06:28.056 --> 06:29.288
No.

06:30.625 --> 06:33.392
Lumberjacking.

06:33.495 --> 06:35.628
"Lumberjacking"?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.965
Right, okay.

06:39.067 --> 06:41.334
And, uh, this was
a hobby of Phyllis' or...?

06:41.436 --> 06:42.835
I wish it were just a hobby.

06:42.937 --> 06:45.638
She'd found her calling as a...

06:45.740 --> 06:48.537
Lumberjill, or whatever
they're called. Six months

06:48.592 --> 06:50.827
in these silly competitions
and she'd won more titles

06:50.897 --> 06:52.358
than 20 years of Golfing.

06:52.406 --> 06:54.632
I'm getting the sense
that you were not a fan.

06:54.734 --> 06:56.000
It was a waste of time.

06:56.102 --> 06:58.236
Why? She was
winning money.

06:58.338 --> 07:00.538
I had more than enough
for the both of us.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.240
We were gonna retire together,

07:02.296 --> 07:04.842
travel, take cooking classes...

07:04.944 --> 07:06.511
Get married.

07:06.613 --> 07:08.983
It must have upset you
when she took her life

07:09.085 --> 07:10.114
in a new direction.

07:11.038 --> 07:12.913
I'm sorry, if you're insinuating

07:12.969 --> 07:14.919
that I would ever hurt Phyllis,

07:15.021 --> 07:16.254
then you're mistaken.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.281
I've been in love with her

07:18.329 --> 07:20.892
since she gave me
my very first Golf lesson.

07:20.994 --> 07:24.554
Any idea who might
have wanted Phyllis dead?

07:24.609 --> 07:26.931
Probably one of
those lumberjackers.

07:27.150 --> 07:30.051
Just last month they threw
a Golf club through our window.

07:30.132 --> 07:31.866
How do you know it
was a lumberjacker?

07:31.948 --> 07:33.702
'Cause there was
a note attached.

07:33.773 --> 07:35.640
"Stick to Golfing, you..."

07:36.709 --> 07:38.643
Well, I'd rather
not say the word.

07:38.745 --> 07:40.111
You can read it yourself.

07:40.213 --> 07:42.180
I gave it to the police.

07:49.856 --> 07:51.400
There's something
you wanted to show me?

07:51.424 --> 07:52.731
<i>Si, si, si.</i>

07:52.793 --> 07:56.360
I found significant
fracturing of the hyoid.

07:56.463 --> 07:59.363
We will have to analyze
it to determine

07:59.466 --> 08:01.599
if it indicates cause of death.

08:01.701 --> 08:04.368
In addition,
I was looking at the striae

08:04.471 --> 08:06.237
where the victim was cut apart.

08:06.339 --> 08:08.339
Now, the tool that was used

08:08.441 --> 08:10.308
made this wave pattern.

08:10.410 --> 08:11.843
What do you make of it?

08:11.945 --> 08:13.511
Well, at first
I wasn't sure, but then

08:13.613 --> 08:15.313
I heard that the victim
was a lumberjack.

08:15.415 --> 08:19.217
So I thought, "Rodolfo..."

08:19.319 --> 08:20.551
Uh, chain saw.

08:20.653 --> 08:21.786
I concur.

08:21.888 --> 08:24.322
A chain saw's teeth
are J-shaped

08:24.424 --> 08:28.326
and make this type of
wave-like kerf mark.

08:28.428 --> 08:30.294
The victim was dismembered
with a chain saw

08:30.396 --> 08:32.073
and she was wearing
those chain metal socks

08:32.097 --> 08:33.366
at time of her death,

08:33.419 --> 08:35.900
which I learned are used for
protecting the lumberjack

08:36.001 --> 08:37.602
from a wild swing of the ax.

08:37.703 --> 08:40.638
The victim was killed
mid-competition.

08:40.740 --> 08:44.174
So someone is going to have to
go to the Lumberjacking contest.

08:44.277 --> 08:46.511
Booth and I will go, yeah.
Oh, hey, hey,

08:46.559 --> 08:48.479
Dr. Brennan...
If you'd like

08:48.581 --> 08:50.381
to spend a little
more time in the lab,

08:50.483 --> 08:52.316
I'm willing to go in your place.

08:52.418 --> 08:54.652
Shh. It's a small sacrifice

08:54.754 --> 08:57.088
- for my favorite boss.
- I sense

08:57.190 --> 08:58.756
that you are being disingenuous

08:58.858 --> 09:00.958
and that you just want
to go to the competition.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.460
Okay, fine, yes, I want to go.

09:03.508 --> 09:05.463
But come on, what guy wouldn't?

09:05.565 --> 09:07.064
All men love chain saws.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.933
That is not a proven fact.

09:09.035 --> 09:10.428
Yes, it is.

09:10.553 --> 09:11.678
Greg.

09:11.741 --> 09:13.108
How do you feel
about chain saws?

09:13.178 --> 09:14.147
I love chain saws.

09:14.195 --> 09:15.811
Boom.

09:15.874 --> 09:19.043
Okay, while Greg is an
adequate security guard,

09:19.145 --> 09:21.579
he's not a sufficient
sample size

09:21.627 --> 09:23.494
to extrapolate

09:23.650 --> 09:25.149
the preferences of
an entire gender.

09:25.251 --> 09:27.184
Booth and I are going
to the competition.

09:27.287 --> 09:29.487
Please clean and
rearticulate the Bones.

09:29.589 --> 09:30.721
Take pictures.

09:30.823 --> 09:33.210
Oh sure, I'll-I'll
chatsnap it.

09:36.296 --> 09:38.282
<i>This is quite impressive.</i>

09:38.352 --> 09:39.556
Well, no, no, no,
it's not impressive.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.754
I think the word that
you're looking for is badass,

09:41.801 --> 09:43.594
all right? This is a major sport,

09:43.672 --> 09:45.736
Bones. It's huge,
and less face it,

09:45.838 --> 09:47.040
it's way more
exciting than Golf.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.586
I imagine the muscle groups

09:48.634 --> 09:52.143
used to swing an ax
are the same as those used

09:52.245 --> 09:54.045
to swing a Golfing stick.

09:54.147 --> 09:55.958
Four years of playing Golf
and you're still calling it

09:55.982 --> 09:57.259
- a Golfing stick.
- It's a stick

09:57.283 --> 09:59.243
used to Golf.
How is that not accurate?

09:59.298 --> 10:00.430
My point is that both

10:00.523 --> 10:03.446
Golfing and Lumberjacking
are just

10:03.524 --> 10:05.422
- applied physics.
- No.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.546
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You d...

10:07.594 --> 10:08.993
Don't try to ruin this for me

10:09.047 --> 10:11.040
like you're ruining
bike riding for Christine.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.844
But everything's mathematics.

10:12.892 --> 10:16.118
Sports, architecture, comedy.

10:16.196 --> 10:18.899
- Comedy is not math.
- Yes, it is. By vectoring

10:18.947 --> 10:20.999
the English language, I can make

10:21.101 --> 10:24.903
a multitude of hilarious jokes.

10:25.005 --> 10:26.504
- Please don't.
- No. For example,

10:26.606 --> 10:28.640
what did the math teacher

10:28.742 --> 10:30.742
say to the Lumberjack?

10:30.844 --> 10:31.844
Don't care.

10:31.912 --> 10:33.178
Make sure you use

10:33.272 --> 10:35.914
the correct "log-arithm."

10:36.000 --> 10:39.032
Hmm? It's all just
simple "geome-tree."

10:39.125 --> 10:41.654
Tree. Like, a tree,
'cause it's a log.

10:41.710 --> 10:44.305
It comes from a tree.
It's a play on words.

11:25.481 --> 11:26.564
Every

11:26.612 --> 11:30.613
person I see is carrying
at least six lethal implements.

11:31.204 --> 11:32.704
Excuse me. Are you
in charge here?

11:32.806 --> 11:34.628
Yeah, Dick Scarn.

11:34.676 --> 11:37.375
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.
This here is my partner,

11:37.477 --> 11:39.293
- Dr. Temperance Brennan.
- Okay. How can I help you?

11:39.317 --> 11:41.550
Well, I'm sorry to report
that one of your lumberjills

11:41.653 --> 11:43.719
- has been murdered.
- Murdered? Who?

11:43.821 --> 11:46.247
- Phyllis Paul.
- Oh.

11:46.341 --> 11:48.677
- Well, too bad.
- <i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

11:48.763 --> 11:50.278
Would you mind
if we ask you a few questions?

11:50.302 --> 11:51.731
Well, they need me
at the main stage,

11:51.755 --> 11:53.394
but, uh, you-you can
walk with me.

11:53.442 --> 11:54.230
Okay.

11:54.332 --> 11:56.216
What happened to your femur?

11:56.403 --> 11:59.286
- Uh, chain saw snapped. I got boned.
- Mm.

11:59.349 --> 12:01.411
- "Bone" is not a verb.
- I got a bone.

12:01.474 --> 12:02.763
- What bone?
- No. A "bone"

12:02.811 --> 12:04.239
is a hard piece of wood, Bones.

12:04.287 --> 12:06.107
- Wait. Who's Bones?
- She's Bones.

12:06.155 --> 12:07.129
I'm Bones.

12:07.177 --> 12:08.200
Oh... oh, I thought
she was Brennan.

12:08.224 --> 12:10.139
Booth, this is exactly why you shouldn't
call me "Bones.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.411
" Right, because, you know what?
This happens all the time.

12:12.435 --> 12:16.216
- When was the last time you saw Phyllis?
- Uh... Tree climb on Tuesday.

12:16.279 --> 12:17.481
She was in that competition,
and...

12:17.505 --> 12:19.466
She hasn't showed up
for anything since.

12:19.552 --> 12:21.001
She was pretty good at these
events, huh? Oh, yeah.

12:21.025 --> 12:22.841
Are you kidding?
When she Came on the scene,

12:22.903 --> 12:24.143
she outclassed the competition.

12:24.194 --> 12:27.208
- Anyone in particular that she dethroned?
- Yeah.

12:27.318 --> 12:30.239
- Helga Thisk.
- Where can we find Helga?

12:30.287 --> 12:32.727
- <i>On the hot zone, ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Right over there.

12:32.789 --> 12:34.556
<i>We got Helga Thisk.
Go get 'em, girl.</i>

12:34.658 --> 12:35.742
Thank you.

12:35.790 --> 12:37.948
Whoa, whoa, Bones. Bones,
let's just wait. Wait.

12:37.995 --> 12:40.061
Just wait until she puts
down that big chain saw

12:40.163 --> 12:42.484
before we accuse
her of murder, okay?

12:48.038 --> 12:49.971
All right!

12:50.073 --> 12:51.940
(Applause, cheering
and whooping)

12:52.042 --> 12:55.209
Okay, we can go now. Come on.

12:58.506 --> 13:01.698
Okay, uh, Ms. Thisk,

13:01.734 --> 13:03.901
can you please put that ax down?

13:04.310 --> 13:06.904
- You're sure Phyllis is dead?
- Yes, her body

13:06.939 --> 13:08.439
was dismembered, and

13:08.474 --> 13:10.264
- is currently decomposing.
- Helga, I took

13:10.327 --> 13:13.373
a look at your competition
history with Phyllis.

13:13.452 --> 13:14.952
Outsider coming in, taking over

13:14.987 --> 13:17.146
the top Lumberjill spot.

13:17.209 --> 13:18.449
That's got to be tough for you.

13:18.513 --> 13:20.161
- It's just a game, Agent Booth.
- Oh, come on.

13:20.185 --> 13:22.226
Let's lose that "it's
just a game," okay?

13:22.261 --> 13:24.278
There's a lot of money
to be made here.

13:24.313 --> 13:26.081
Right? There's tons of sponsors.
You would remove

13:26.105 --> 13:27.302
- anyone who got in your way.
- Mm-hmm.

13:27.326 --> 13:29.266
What? You think I killed Phyllis?

13:29.302 --> 13:31.975
Why would I kill her?
We were training partners.

13:32.053 --> 13:33.911
She was giving me
all her secrets.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.630
- What secrets?
- Just some math

13:35.678 --> 13:37.615
stuff that she'd use
to calculate each chop,

13:37.670 --> 13:39.036
like they do it in Golf.

13:39.131 --> 13:42.568
As they should do it
in every athletic endeavor.

13:42.662 --> 13:44.607
Measuring angles
and diameters forever

13:44.670 --> 13:46.318
- before she even took her first swing.
- Helga,

13:46.342 --> 13:48.099
Can you think of anyone
who'd want to hurt Phyllis?

13:48.123 --> 13:49.310
Probably the crazy fans.

13:49.358 --> 13:51.028
They hated her. They said

13:51.076 --> 13:53.373
she was making the sport dull
with all her measuring.

13:53.435 --> 13:55.061
- Don't blame 'em.
- Helgy!

13:55.096 --> 13:56.607
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

13:56.717 --> 13:59.451
I'm sorry. This is
my husband Ragnar.

13:59.615 --> 14:01.959
Ragnar, these people
are from the FBI.

14:02.084 --> 14:04.482
- Phyllis was murdered.
- Wow!

14:04.600 --> 14:07.307
I mean, I didn't take Phyllis
for the getting-murdered type.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.631
It's a shame.

14:08.709 --> 14:10.677
- You don't seem too upset.
- Oh, no. I'll say

14:10.712 --> 14:12.212
a "yoho" for her later. For now,

14:12.247 --> 14:13.810
we got a competition to think
of. We've got to head over

14:13.834 --> 14:15.526
- to the stage for the Jack and Jill.
- Whoa.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.286
- Wait a second. A two-man saw?
- Bones, we got to see it.

14:17.310 --> 14:18.829
It's a fan favorite.
Booth, we're in the middle

14:18.853 --> 14:20.398
- of a murder investigation.
- Yes, and the fans

14:20.422 --> 14:22.522
are our possible suspects
here, so,

14:22.557 --> 14:24.264
what kind of detectives
would we be

14:24.312 --> 14:26.756
if we didn't check out
the most popular event?

14:32.951 --> 14:35.335
Hey, how's it going up here?

14:35.370 --> 14:37.470
The day started out well.

14:37.505 --> 14:40.080
I analyzed the hyoid further,
found fracturing on

14:40.166 --> 14:41.841
the Greater Cornua, which means

14:41.876 --> 14:44.143
that the cause of death
was most likely strangulation.

14:44.179 --> 14:45.445
- Nice.
- No, no.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.463
Not nice.
I spent the last few hours

14:47.541 --> 14:48.715
scraping tiny pieces

14:48.750 --> 14:51.447
of solid matter out of the bone
that got lodged

14:51.541 --> 14:53.525
into the striae
during dismemberment.

14:53.573 --> 14:56.089
- This is the slowest process.
- I know it doesn't

14:56.124 --> 14:57.602
- seem like a lot,
- but hey, hey, hey,

14:57.626 --> 14:59.259
this could actually
help me determine

14:59.294 --> 15:00.533
where the victim was cut up.

15:00.588 --> 15:02.345
Also, I analyzed

15:02.416 --> 15:04.315
the nine-iron that was thrown
through the victim's window,

15:04.339 --> 15:05.963
and I think
I may have found traces

15:06.011 --> 15:08.134
of Permethrin
and Piperonyl Butoxide.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.070
- Pesticides.
- Professional grade.

15:10.148 --> 15:11.671
We may be looking for an exterminator.

15:11.706 --> 15:13.890
- How's it going up there?
- Well... Let's ask her.

15:13.994 --> 15:16.601
Um, yeah, you go
ahead and do that.

15:16.649 --> 15:17.859
- I'm actually working on my own thing.

15:17.883 --> 15:19.405
What? Is your own thing
more important than chain saws?

15:19.429 --> 15:21.715
- Dr.Hodgins?!
- Yeah, I-I got to go. Hey, Cam.

15:21.763 --> 15:23.499
Dr. Hodgins!
Dr. Saroyan.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.782
- Yes.
- As you know, uh,

15:26.867 --> 15:28.767
Dr. Brennan and I Came
to the conclusion

15:28.928 --> 15:31.128
that the victim was dismembered
with a chain saw.

15:31.226 --> 15:33.718
Yes. I have since learned
that each competitor

15:33.780 --> 15:35.785
at the Lumber Sports
Competition has his

15:35.914 --> 15:37.881
or her own unique chain saw.

15:38.033 --> 15:41.249
Therefore, I believe
it is absolutely necessary

15:41.336 --> 15:43.069
to the case to subpoena

15:43.104 --> 15:47.040
each chain saw so that
I may test them... to match

15:47.075 --> 15:50.076
the resulting striations
to the striations

15:50.111 --> 15:52.900
on the victim's Bones,
thus enabling me

15:52.948 --> 15:57.408
to determine whose chain saw
was used to dismember the body.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.486
So... you want
to play with chain saws?

16:00.522 --> 16:03.322
Play with chains... no.

16:03.415 --> 16:05.291
I don't even like chain saws.

16:05.327 --> 16:08.165
No. Believe me,
if there is another way

16:08.428 --> 16:11.062
to find the correct chain saw,
I'll do it.

16:11.333 --> 16:12.986
Really? 'Cause I was
actually gonna say,

16:13.040 --> 16:15.283
I think testing chain saws
is an excellent idea.

16:15.370 --> 16:18.150
Really? But since you'd prefer
to do it a different way...

16:18.198 --> 16:19.118
No, no.

16:19.166 --> 16:20.204
- Thank you.
- Sure.

16:20.239 --> 16:23.430
The lumber sports saved
this sliced wood

16:23.478 --> 16:25.845
from Monday's
chain saw competition,

16:25.880 --> 16:28.147
and... it's a real treat...

16:28.183 --> 16:30.583
They're even labeled with
each competitor's name.

16:30.618 --> 16:32.684
- Great.
- So why don't you compare

16:32.739 --> 16:34.288
the striations on the Bones

16:34.336 --> 16:35.688
- to those on this wood?
- Good.

16:35.724 --> 16:37.590
That way you don't have to worry

16:37.638 --> 16:39.410
about testing those chain
saws yourself.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.028
- Mm-hmm.
- Since you didn't want to do it anyway.

16:42.239 --> 16:44.230
Yay.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.166
Hey, Angie.

16:47.202 --> 16:49.739
Hey, um, I'm looking at
this photo you just sent,

16:49.809 --> 16:51.304
but I am so confused.

16:51.339 --> 16:54.723
It's labeled "crime scene,"
but we don't even know where

16:54.771 --> 16:56.171
this murder took place.

16:56.270 --> 16:59.238
Yeah, um, that's because, uh...

16:59.273 --> 17:02.041
It's from a different murder,

17:02.239 --> 17:04.376
not this case.

17:06.207 --> 17:07.894
Oh, my God. Wait a second.

17:07.942 --> 17:11.244
I remember this. This is from,
uh, the lobbyist's murder,

17:11.292 --> 17:12.214
the one that Zack committed.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.871
Confessed to, not committed.

17:15.123 --> 17:17.684
Are-are... are you
trying to prove that?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.503
What can I do to help?

17:21.684 --> 17:25.597
Okay, um, I think I may have
found a way to prove

17:25.633 --> 17:26.713
that the killer wasn't Zack

17:26.748 --> 17:28.848
based on the severity
of the stabbing.

17:29.003 --> 17:30.645
Here. See, look.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.207
There's too much blood.

17:32.356 --> 17:34.873
I mean, if Zack were to stab
someone, which...

17:34.909 --> 17:38.944
But still, uh, he'd do it
as cleanly as possible.

17:39.106 --> 17:41.395
Yeah, I-I just don't
know if this is enough

17:41.512 --> 17:43.048
to overturn a conviction.

17:43.084 --> 17:45.762
It's a start.

17:46.129 --> 17:48.320
Yeah, it is.

17:48.465 --> 17:51.989
Can I show you something
from the current case?

17:52.394 --> 17:54.060
Yeah.

17:55.102 --> 17:57.067
- What's up?
- Okay.

17:57.246 --> 18:00.317
So when Helga said
that fans hated Phyllis,

18:00.457 --> 18:02.856
I went online, and I found this.

18:02.973 --> 18:05.659
"North East Lumber Sports fans
are the bombest fans."

18:05.707 --> 18:07.441
Wow. This gene frong

18:07.489 --> 18:09.475
- guy is really die-hard.
- Yeah, and

18:09.510 --> 18:11.076
he hated Phyllis.

18:11.112 --> 18:13.545
He thought that she was ruining
the sport. Check this out.

18:13.581 --> 18:16.348
What's up, everybody?
Gene frong in the house.

18:16.383 --> 18:17.850
Right behind me here
is Phyllis Paul.

18:17.885 --> 18:20.786
She's measuring her log,
and like always,

18:20.821 --> 18:22.121
she's taking her sweet time.

18:22.156 --> 18:23.755
Hey! Hey, Phyllis?!

18:23.791 --> 18:25.157
What's taking you so long?

18:25.192 --> 18:26.892
Yeah, we're bored.

18:26.927 --> 18:28.872
Hurry it up. Hey. I got to
say, it is kind of boring.

18:28.896 --> 18:30.362
Phyllis sucks!

18:30.410 --> 18:32.895
Phyllis sucks! Phyllis sucks!

18:33.007 --> 18:35.000
- That's right.
- Hit her in the face!

18:35.035 --> 18:36.789
- Hit her in the face!
- Phyllis sucks!

18:36.837 --> 18:39.179
They're doing it.

18:39.390 --> 18:40.606
I did some digging.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.530
Gene works for his dad's
extermination company.

18:43.578 --> 18:44.656
Angie, I think you just

18:44.726 --> 18:46.765
found our nine-iron thrower.

18:47.070 --> 18:48.539
<i>Look, Bones,
if I were an 18-year-old</i>

18:48.587 --> 18:49.748
punk, where would I be?

18:49.783 --> 18:51.617
- Where the beer is.
- Come on.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.553
I was a teenager once, Booth,

18:54.588 --> 18:57.990
and I observed that my peers
enjoyed the consumption

18:58.025 --> 19:00.058
of inexpensive alcohol.

19:00.094 --> 19:01.505
Now, this is what
I'm talking about...

19:01.529 --> 19:03.259
Good old-fashioned log roll.

19:03.361 --> 19:04.997
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

19:05.032 --> 19:07.266
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

19:07.301 --> 19:09.234
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

19:09.270 --> 19:11.492
Oh!

19:11.563 --> 19:13.407
- Hey, excuse me.
- Ah! Whew! That's two.

19:13.461 --> 19:14.719
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

19:14.813 --> 19:17.430
Gene Frong, need a word
with you over here, please?

19:17.680 --> 19:19.341
I'm 21, I swear!

19:19.389 --> 19:21.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:22.950 --> 19:24.883
Hey!

19:24.919 --> 19:26.218
Oh. Sorry.

19:26.253 --> 19:27.686
Oh. Hey!

19:27.721 --> 19:30.022
Oh. Sorry.

19:31.325 --> 19:34.059
Oh, come on, you got
to be kidding me.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.268
- Will you get down now?!
- I'll stay up

19:36.316 --> 19:38.348
- here all day.
- Well, he can't stay there forever.

19:38.372 --> 19:40.377
Oh, Bones, we don't have
enough time here. We don't.

19:40.401 --> 19:41.845
- Let's go. Relax!
- Booth! Booth! Booth!

19:41.869 --> 19:43.184
Stop! No.

19:43.262 --> 19:45.520
Successful axmanship requires

19:45.582 --> 19:47.762
- mathematic calculation.
- You got to be kidding me.

19:47.817 --> 19:53.045
First, we find the radius of
the log and divide it by 1.25.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.414
- Come on.
- Then...

19:55.449 --> 19:58.261
Okay, just take a step a back. Take a step
back. What? We plot the angle of attack.

19:58.285 --> 20:00.819
Enough is enough here with this.

20:00.854 --> 20:02.988
That's right!
Good chop!

20:03.023 --> 20:04.568
(Indistinct chatter,
applause and cheering)

20:04.592 --> 20:06.925
Okay, okay, okay,
I'm coming down.

20:06.961 --> 20:08.760
Shh. Put it down! Put it down!

20:08.796 --> 20:10.840
You see that, Bones, huh?
Don't need science

20:10.894 --> 20:12.728
- to take care of this guy.
- Let's go.

20:14.168 --> 20:16.668
Hey, Cam. What's up?
Hey, based on

20:16.762 --> 20:20.073
what Rodolfo found on the hyoid,
I examined the tissue around

20:20.121 --> 20:22.370
the victim's neck
and found hydrogenated

20:22.418 --> 20:24.887
- Triglycerides.
- That's vegetable shortening.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.089
What was it doing
around her neck?

20:26.113 --> 20:28.221
The murderer's hands
must have been covered in it.

20:28.269 --> 20:31.418
Well, the grease-to-person ratio
at this event is

20:31.480 --> 20:33.605
exceptionally high,
but I'll do my best

20:33.653 --> 20:37.756
to keep an eye out
for users of Triglycerides.

20:37.791 --> 20:40.854
<i>Look, I think when Phyllis
didn't listen to your request</i>

20:40.902 --> 20:43.792
to stick to Golf, you decided
to kick it up a couple notches.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.707
What?! No. I loved Phyllis.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.855
Well, I don't tend to
throw Golfing sticks

20:47.941 --> 20:49.925
through the windows
of people that I love.

20:49.973 --> 20:51.074
Golf clubs.
They're not sticks.

20:51.098 --> 20:52.337
Same thing.
Yeah, okay.

20:52.373 --> 20:54.740
Maybe that was a little
too crazy, but I would...

20:54.775 --> 20:56.746
I would never kill Phyllis.

20:56.842 --> 20:58.998
- She was too much fun to have around.
- Yeah.

20:59.046 --> 21:01.426
At first, the whole measuring
thing sucked, but...

21:01.474 --> 21:03.649
A bunch of us would start
going to her events

21:03.684 --> 21:06.184
just to yell at her,
and that was a lot of fun.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.786
The flapjack guy even sold

21:07.821 --> 21:09.588
special pancakes
just to throw at her.

21:09.623 --> 21:12.918
Cam said that the killer's hands
were covered in shortening.

21:12.966 --> 21:13.901
Gene, did

21:13.949 --> 21:16.026
the flapjack guy have anything
against Phyllis?

21:16.074 --> 21:17.929
Yeah, they had a...

21:17.965 --> 21:19.980
Hilarious feud going on.

21:20.028 --> 21:22.134
What kind of feud?
Well, uh, at first,

21:22.169 --> 21:24.369
she said that his coffee
tasted like dirt,

21:24.405 --> 21:26.305
so then he put a spider
in her mug.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.806
And that's when she let all

21:27.841 --> 21:29.853
the air out in his tires,
and that's when he started

21:29.877 --> 21:32.177
selling the "fling a flap
at Phyllis" special.

21:32.212 --> 21:33.979
- I think we need to talk to him.
- Okay.

21:34.014 --> 21:35.514
Um, can I... can I go now?

21:35.549 --> 21:38.283
I have to pee really,
really bad.

21:38.319 --> 21:42.120
That's due to the fact that
you consumed 24 ounces of beer.

21:42.156 --> 21:44.256
Fluid is filling your bladder,

21:44.291 --> 21:48.360
applying pressure to stretch
receptors, which signal

21:48.395 --> 21:50.333
- your urethra.
- Lady,

21:50.482 --> 21:53.224
you're not making this
any easier for me.

21:57.036 --> 21:58.785
Does that help?

22:06.230 --> 22:08.331
Get two orders right here,
this one.

22:12.770 --> 22:14.437
Oh, my God.

22:14.472 --> 22:16.005
Family recipe,

22:16.040 --> 22:18.338
passed down from flap to flap
for generations.

22:18.426 --> 22:19.471
So, I understand

22:19.519 --> 22:22.511
you had a bit of a feud going
with Phyllis Paul.

22:22.547 --> 22:24.914
Oh, it wasn't that bad.
Really? I...

22:24.949 --> 22:27.550
Beg to differ... it says here
that after the pancake tossing,

22:27.585 --> 22:29.530
Phyllis reported your truck
to the health department.

22:29.554 --> 22:31.253
That was just Phyllis
being Phyllis.

22:31.289 --> 22:33.589
She wasn't the nicest Jill
at the Jamboree.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.559
But after a failed
inspection, you had to buy

22:36.594 --> 22:38.160
a brand-new truck.
Planning on it.

22:38.196 --> 22:40.730
Yeah, it was time to retire
that rusty old clunker anyway.

22:40.765 --> 22:42.869
Listen, Jack, we found traces

22:42.955 --> 22:44.884
of vegetable shortening
on Phyllis's neck.

22:44.932 --> 22:45.946
How do you explain that?

22:45.994 --> 22:47.136
Vegetable shortening.

22:47.171 --> 22:49.405
What do you think I am?
I cook with butter,

22:49.440 --> 22:50.970
that I make from scratch.

22:51.018 --> 22:53.963
I should have caught that.
Hold on a second here.

22:56.848 --> 22:58.347
No, there's a, uh,

22:58.383 --> 23:00.940
complexity of the flavor,
no aftertaste.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.056
That's definitely butter.

23:02.104 --> 23:05.150
Why am I getting a hint of a...
Like, a smoked meat?

23:05.198 --> 23:08.307
Bits of bacon in the batter.
I cure it myself.

23:08.489 --> 23:12.268
Adds a hint of umami, which
balances out the sweetness.

23:12.927 --> 23:14.705
That's beautiful.

23:14.815 --> 23:16.929
It's a flap family secret.

23:16.964 --> 23:18.630
So, what about Phyllis?

23:18.721 --> 23:20.632
Anything strange going on
with her lately?

23:20.668 --> 23:22.835
Eh, Phyllis kept to herself.

23:22.870 --> 23:24.345
Brought her own "healthy" food

23:24.393 --> 23:25.792
in those little
tupperware containers.

23:25.816 --> 23:27.393
- Yeah, I know the type.
- Yeah.

23:27.463 --> 23:30.627
In fact, last Tuesday's the
first time I ever saw that gal

23:30.675 --> 23:31.893
eating carbohydrate.

23:32.646 --> 23:34.646
Wait, did you say last Tuesday?

23:34.682 --> 23:37.306
Yeah.
Still obnoxious as ever,

23:37.354 --> 23:38.955
jabbering away on the phone
the whole time,

23:38.979 --> 23:41.954
but oh, boy, she made her way
through a giant Jack stack

23:41.989 --> 23:43.525
faster than I can flip a flap.

23:43.627 --> 23:45.846
Thanks, Jack.

23:46.060 --> 23:47.326
Ooh.

23:47.361 --> 23:49.328
Can I take
my giant Jack stack to go?

23:49.363 --> 23:50.863
You better.

23:52.132 --> 23:53.966
Dr. Fuentes,

23:54.001 --> 23:56.835
have you found a wood slab
that matches the striations?

23:56.871 --> 23:58.103
Not yet.

23:58.138 --> 24:00.572
I was looking at the hyoid
and the surrounding area

24:00.608 --> 24:02.007
to determine cause of death.

24:02.042 --> 24:03.542
I found something interesting

24:03.577 --> 24:05.110
on the C4 Vertebra.

24:05.145 --> 24:08.213
Crushing fracture
on the anterior surface.

24:08.249 --> 24:10.045
The fracturing is too extensive

24:10.093 --> 24:11.640
to have been caused
by human hands.

24:11.725 --> 24:14.554
Whatever implement was used
squished its way

24:14.624 --> 24:16.210
into the tissue of the neck

24:16.327 --> 24:17.968
and made contact
with the front of the Vertebra.

24:17.992 --> 24:20.592
There's a substantial amount
of muscle in the neck,

24:20.628 --> 24:22.577
so whatever implement
was used must have been

24:22.625 --> 24:25.292
- extremely strong.
- My guess is a pliable metal.

24:25.413 --> 24:29.067
But why would the murderer cover
it in vegetable shortening?

24:30.471 --> 24:32.511
Hey, so, I got something
really interesting for you.

24:32.539 --> 24:33.944
- What is it, Aubrey?
- So, the day

24:34.008 --> 24:36.233
that Phyllis died,
she ate pancakes.

24:36.281 --> 24:38.822
- Okay, you know what? I got to go.
- Wait-wait. Booth, Booth, look.

24:38.846 --> 24:40.946
You know that Phyllis
was an intense competitor

24:40.981 --> 24:42.187
who ate clean, right?

24:42.235 --> 24:43.882
Look, there's got to be a reason

24:43.918 --> 24:44.950
that Phyllis bought

24:44.985 --> 24:46.518
a stack of pancakes from a guy

24:46.553 --> 24:47.786
that she hated.

24:47.808 --> 24:49.141
My guess is she was stressed.

24:49.189 --> 24:50.398
All right,
let's just think about it.

24:50.422 --> 24:51.935
When an athlete gets stressed,
you know,

24:51.959 --> 24:53.692
their... their scores,
they go down.

24:53.727 --> 24:56.128
What do you say we just go check
out the tournament web site

24:56.163 --> 24:57.663
and look at her scores?

24:57.698 --> 24:58.997
That's good thinking.

24:59.033 --> 25:00.332
Wait a second.

25:00.367 --> 25:01.767
That doesn't add up.

25:01.802 --> 25:04.678
Well, she was winning, but...
Not as much

25:04.726 --> 25:06.483
- as her past competitions...
- You might be right.

25:06.507 --> 25:07.940
- Phyllis was off.
- Huh?

25:07.975 --> 25:11.343
Come on! I'm, like,
a Forensic Food-Ologist.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.643
Hello?

25:18.519 --> 25:20.382
Hey, Angie?

25:20.476 --> 25:22.107
I just ran
the solid matter that Rodolfo

25:22.155 --> 25:23.740
found in the chain saw
striations

25:23.788 --> 25:25.061
- through the mass spec.
- Did it give you

25:25.085 --> 25:28.030
any indication of where
Phyllis' body was dismembered?

25:28.132 --> 25:30.053
Well, I found
<i>Aphanomyces Laevis,</i>

25:30.088 --> 25:32.983
<i>Lasiodiplodia Theobromae,</i>
and <i> Phialocephala Virens.</i>

25:33.054 --> 25:34.324
They're plant fungi.

25:34.359 --> 25:36.515
But they feed on plants from
completely different climates.

25:36.539 --> 25:38.226
I'm talking, like, where...

25:38.257 --> 25:40.537
Where does a cactus grow
next to a water Lily?

25:40.585 --> 25:42.059
In a plant nursery?

25:42.094 --> 25:44.632
Oh, yeah, right. Huh.
Sometimes I forget

25:44.710 --> 25:46.054
these things exist
outside of nature.

25:46.078 --> 25:48.429
Well, I can run a search
for all the nurseries

25:48.491 --> 25:50.733
in the area of the
Lumberjack Tournament.

25:50.889 --> 25:53.194
Yeah. Um, by the way,
i think I found something

25:53.257 --> 25:55.390
- on the Lobbyist's rib.
- Didn't Brennan

25:55.444 --> 25:57.396
already analyze
the Lobbyist's bones?

25:57.453 --> 25:58.788
She missed something.

25:58.823 --> 26:00.189
Brennan missed something?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.608
- On a bone?
- Inside one of the wound tracts

26:02.694 --> 26:05.140
I found what could be the
killer's microbial signature.

26:05.265 --> 26:07.441
It's a combination of all
the particles every human emits.

26:07.465 --> 26:09.165
It can be used to distinguish

26:09.200 --> 26:12.062
between individuals.
Yeah, I've-I've heard of that,

26:12.140 --> 26:13.236
but there are variables.

26:13.271 --> 26:15.858
I don't think that's
ever actually held up in court.

26:15.906 --> 26:17.306
First time for everything.

26:17.342 --> 26:18.808
Yeah.

26:21.012 --> 26:23.279
Okay, uh,
so these are the nurseries

26:23.314 --> 26:25.581
located within a five-mile
radius of the tournament.

26:25.629 --> 26:28.394
It looks like they're all
in a densely populated area.

26:28.538 --> 26:29.733
Yeah, there's no way the killer

26:29.757 --> 26:31.717
could have dismembered
the victim with a chain saw

26:31.749 --> 26:33.589
at any of these places
without someone hearing.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.865
Angie, what about

26:34.913 --> 26:37.493
any nurseries in the area
that closed?

26:37.528 --> 26:38.959
I mean, a bunch of
untended plants...

26:38.983 --> 26:41.132
that would explain the
amount of fungus I found.

26:41.198 --> 26:42.421
Yeah.

26:44.021 --> 26:46.155
Bonnie's Garden.

26:46.971 --> 26:49.405
Huh. It was closed a year ago.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.808
And it's located a half mile
from the tournament.

26:57.155 --> 26:59.282
There's blood here.

26:59.317 --> 27:01.284
And a lot of it.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.786
This is definitely where
our victim was dismembered.

27:03.821 --> 27:06.489
Yeah, a remote area, drainage...

27:06.601 --> 27:08.202
It's pretty clever.

27:08.250 --> 27:10.026
Guys, look.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.061
This pot is singed

27:12.096 --> 27:14.563
along the rim.

27:14.599 --> 27:16.632
Someone tried to burn
the victim's clothing?

27:16.668 --> 27:17.843
Definitely.

27:17.891 --> 27:19.991
And the other sock.

27:20.905 --> 27:23.372
Wait a minute.

27:24.695 --> 27:26.108
What is this?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.921
It's a flipline.
It's a steel cable that

27:28.007 --> 27:31.947
Lumberjacks use to scale the
pole in the tree climb event.

27:32.171 --> 27:34.550
Belonged to our victim.
You think

27:34.585 --> 27:36.779
- this could be the murder weapon?
- It definitely

27:36.827 --> 27:38.187
- fits the parameters.
- Hold on a second.

27:38.209 --> 27:40.710
I can tell you for sure.
Can you hold that out?

27:41.373 --> 27:43.673
Yep. Lipids.

27:43.873 --> 27:45.952
This flipline is covered in fat.

27:45.999 --> 27:48.062
Hey, ten to one,
it's vegetable shortening.

27:48.163 --> 27:50.166
Well, if so,
we've got our murder weapon.

27:50.201 --> 27:51.233
Yes!

27:51.269 --> 27:53.369
King of the plant graveyard.

27:53.404 --> 27:55.327
I still don't understand
why'd you put

27:55.375 --> 27:57.306
shortening on a flipline.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.752
Well, a slippery
flipline would make it

27:58.776 --> 28:00.976
nearly impossible
to scale the pole.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.163
Sabotage.

28:03.303 --> 28:05.264
- That explains her lower scores.
- But Phyllis

28:05.312 --> 28:07.116
- was still winning.
- So maybe

28:07.194 --> 28:09.518
this saboteur
just got impatient,

28:09.554 --> 28:11.487
killed her instead.

28:23.820 --> 28:26.176
No, no. No, no. Bones,
what are you doing?

28:26.224 --> 28:27.551
Proving to you that

28:27.575 --> 28:30.522
- Lumberjacking is physics.
- I am sure that it is,

28:30.570 --> 28:31.415
but I told you,
I don't want to know.

28:31.463 --> 28:33.505
Don't you wonder how
the world functions?

28:33.547 --> 28:34.518
You know what, Bones?

28:34.553 --> 28:36.102
Some things in life,
they need to be a mystery, okay?

28:36.126 --> 28:37.754
Like the Internet.
Why planes fly.

28:37.790 --> 28:39.577
Farts.
Transfer protocol,

28:39.625 --> 28:41.938
manipulation of air pressure,

28:42.016 --> 28:44.055
- vibrations of the anal...
- Nah!

28:44.103 --> 28:46.330
Don't need to know that
right now, okay?

28:46.365 --> 28:48.131
What is this?
Th-this is silly!

28:48.167 --> 28:49.750
Hi, Cam. Go ahead.

28:49.798 --> 28:52.436
I found epithelial cells
on the flipline,

28:52.471 --> 28:56.039
so I ran the DNA
and got a hit from the Maryland

28:56.075 --> 28:58.308
- volunteer fireman database.
- Well, who is it?

28:58.356 --> 29:00.377
Ragnar Thisk.

29:00.412 --> 29:02.425
Helga's husband?
Well, looks like the husband

29:02.503 --> 29:03.761
wanted to get a leg up
for the wife.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.566
Tell you what, hey...
You up for, uh, another visit

29:06.621 --> 29:07.784
to the Lumberjack Show?

29:07.820 --> 29:09.119
Huh?

29:09.167 --> 29:11.040
And we're not taking these.

29:11.136 --> 29:14.597
- Sabotage...
- Never. Dispute is about community.

29:14.761 --> 29:16.613
- Oh!
Ah, thas what assesed sponsors...

29:16.660 --> 29:18.660
sponsored... money at risk?

29:18.708 --> 29:19.910
And you were the loser.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.871
This woman is not a loser.

29:21.996 --> 29:23.834
I'm merely stating a fact.

29:23.869 --> 29:26.480
She lost, ergo she is a loser.

29:26.566 --> 29:29.206
Ragnar, you're very protective
of your wife there.

29:29.261 --> 29:31.575
I bet you would do anything
to see her win.

29:31.610 --> 29:32.843
Maybe even commit...

29:32.878 --> 29:34.044
- Murder?
- No!

29:34.079 --> 29:35.512
Then why did we find

29:35.547 --> 29:37.547
your DNA on Phyllis's flipline,

29:37.583 --> 29:39.950
the implement used
to murder her?

29:41.253 --> 29:43.820
Okay. I greased the flipline.

29:43.856 --> 29:46.472
I was trying to sabotage
Phyllis, but I didn't

29:46.520 --> 29:48.785
- kill her, okay?
- Rag, how could you do that?

29:48.833 --> 29:50.761
I could see how hard
you were working.

29:50.796 --> 29:53.363
All those late nights spent
practicing with Phyllis.

29:53.399 --> 29:54.628
- Ragnar, please.
- Sometimes you

29:54.652 --> 29:55.893
didn't even get
home till morning.

29:55.917 --> 29:57.434
Come on, now, I wasn't
working that hard.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.527
Oh... Don't be humble.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.477
What about all those weekend
Lumberjacking trips

30:01.511 --> 30:03.941
you and Phyllis
were always going on?

30:04.191 --> 30:06.363
She'd come home
completely wiped.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.628
Phyllis's training must have

30:07.676 --> 30:10.769
really tuckered her out.

30:11.456 --> 30:12.716
Mr. Thisk,

30:12.751 --> 30:14.918
can you please step outside?

30:15.320 --> 30:17.187
Thank you.

30:28.200 --> 30:30.527
Okay, Phyllis and i
were sleeping together.

30:30.575 --> 30:31.761
We were gonna leave

30:31.809 --> 30:34.011
Nancy and Ragnar
and get married.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.161
We even got fitted for rings
last week.

30:38.239 --> 30:40.373
And now...

30:40.652 --> 30:43.246
She's gone.

30:44.416 --> 30:45.972
There... there, there.

30:46.020 --> 30:46.985
What does "there, there" mean?

30:47.033 --> 30:48.167
It's okay.

30:48.215 --> 30:49.746
It's supposed to comfort her.

30:49.870 --> 30:50.910
Maybe try the bear.

30:50.965 --> 30:52.331
Let's give her
some time, please.

30:52.402 --> 30:53.924
- Do you want a bear?
- Stop.

30:53.959 --> 30:55.225
Give her the bear.

30:55.260 --> 30:56.827
Helga. Please.

30:56.862 --> 30:58.095
Hey. What's up?

30:58.130 --> 31:00.144
I need you to swab
something for me.

31:00.192 --> 31:02.265
I've been looking
at the striations on the bone.

31:02.301 --> 31:03.567
I found kerf marks

31:03.602 --> 31:04.901
on the right femur.

31:04.937 --> 31:07.170
Now, they appear
to have been made by an ax,

31:07.206 --> 31:09.401
and they were made
prior to the chain saw damage.

31:09.487 --> 31:11.052
Wait a minute. You
think someone attempted

31:11.076 --> 31:13.103
- to chop up the body with an ax first?
- Exactly.

31:13.213 --> 31:15.252
But if a Lumberjack took a swing
on the bone, he or she

31:15.276 --> 31:17.736
would have been strong enough
to do more damage than this.

31:17.791 --> 31:19.349
In addition, none of the slabs

31:19.385 --> 31:21.666
of wood that Cam gave us
match the striations.

31:21.791 --> 31:23.081
So if we're not looking
for a Lumberjack...

31:23.105 --> 31:25.182
We're not looking
for a Lumberjack's chain saw.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.057
The killer could have used
any make or model

31:27.127 --> 31:28.759
of chain saw in the world.

31:28.794 --> 31:32.996
How will we ever figure out
which one it is?

32:09.291 --> 32:11.408
It was his idea.

32:11.783 --> 32:13.994
Look, I don't care
whose idea this was.

32:14.042 --> 32:15.872
Someone tell me what's going on.

32:15.908 --> 32:17.307
Okay.

32:17.342 --> 32:18.742
I'll explain, I guess.

32:18.777 --> 32:20.931
Based on a multitude
of evidence,

32:21.009 --> 32:22.798
Hodgins and I Came
to the conclusion

32:22.908 --> 32:24.478
that the killer's
not a Lumberjack.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.771
So we're not looking
for a Lumberjack's chain saw,

32:26.819 --> 32:28.819
we're looking for a regular
consumer chain saw.

32:28.854 --> 32:30.654
So...

32:30.689 --> 32:32.022
We're testing all of them.

32:32.057 --> 32:33.824
And what exactly
is the plan here?

32:33.859 --> 32:35.826
Look, Cam, if we can find
the make and model

32:35.861 --> 32:38.462
of the chain saw that was used,
we may be able to match it

32:38.510 --> 32:40.264
to a chain saw owned
by one of the remaining

32:40.312 --> 32:43.079
non-lumberjack suspects.

32:43.902 --> 32:45.277
Unfortunately,
there's a small grain

32:45.301 --> 32:47.003
of intelligence in that theory.

32:47.039 --> 32:48.128
So...

32:48.206 --> 32:49.372
We can keep going?

32:49.408 --> 32:51.174
Just get it over with.

32:51.210 --> 32:52.576
Yeah!

32:54.947 --> 32:57.180
So it looks like Phyllis'
girlfriend, Nancy,

32:57.216 --> 32:59.854
is our prime suspect. I mean,
she definitely has motive.

32:59.902 --> 33:01.613
And the force profile indicates

33:01.661 --> 33:03.080
that the killer is
not a lumberjack.

33:03.128 --> 33:04.134
Well, Aubrey, you know,

33:04.170 --> 33:05.980
went and checked out her house,
no one was there.

33:06.004 --> 33:08.198
And he's also checking out
the country club.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.327
Booth, is that...?

33:10.362 --> 33:13.029
You can't hide from me,
you lumber slut.

33:13.899 --> 33:15.098
Nancy!

33:15.133 --> 33:17.000
Nancy Albert, hold on.
Oh.

33:17.035 --> 33:18.768
Easy. Okay.

33:20.772 --> 33:22.572
Wow!

33:22.608 --> 33:24.174
Okay, look at that, huh?

33:24.209 --> 33:25.876
Talk about a good Seth joyner
takedown.

33:25.911 --> 33:26.921
All right, that's it.
Turn around.

33:26.945 --> 33:28.578
Let's go. Let's go.

33:28.614 --> 33:31.581
I hate to tell you, but you
are under arrest. Up.

33:35.312 --> 33:37.979
Nancy, I hear you've
got quite the temper?

33:38.015 --> 33:39.849
I'm sorry, wouldn't you
if you just found out

33:39.927 --> 33:41.631
your girlfriend was in
love with someone else?

33:41.655 --> 33:44.336
It might lead someone to murder.
I didn't kill her.

33:44.372 --> 33:45.896
I just found out
about it this morning.

33:45.942 --> 33:47.746
- This morning? From whom?
- I got a call

33:47.771 --> 33:48.809
from our jeweler.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.058
He asked if the ring fit.

33:50.093 --> 33:51.526
I never received any ring.

33:51.562 --> 33:53.028
How do you know
that Phyllis wasn't

33:53.063 --> 33:54.926
planning on giving you
a ring before she died?

33:54.996 --> 33:56.074
He said she'd had it

33:56.099 --> 33:59.067
resized to a nine.
I'm a five and a half.

33:59.102 --> 34:01.449
It was obviously
meant for that Ogre.

34:01.496 --> 34:04.005
- So you knew about Helga?
- I suspected.

34:04.041 --> 34:06.575
Yeah, but this
just confirmed it.

34:06.610 --> 34:09.176
You don't buy a four-carat
diamond for a friend.

34:09.293 --> 34:10.340
Four carats.

34:10.364 --> 34:13.266
That's a very expensive ring.

34:13.606 --> 34:15.473
You know if Helga
actually got it?

34:15.498 --> 34:17.254
Well, good luck
finding it if she did.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.420
It probably looks
like a speck of dust

34:19.456 --> 34:21.989
on those sausage
fingers of hers.

34:22.087 --> 34:24.487
The hard sell... again.

34:35.047 --> 34:36.882
Hey, Hodgins, these striations

34:36.907 --> 34:38.897
still don't match.

34:39.022 --> 34:40.275
Why are you yelling?

34:40.310 --> 34:41.678
Well...

34:41.703 --> 34:42.928
Just grab another saw.

34:42.998 --> 34:44.286
Well, I'm going to test this one

34:44.312 --> 34:46.225
for a third time,
just to be sure.

34:47.139 --> 34:48.560
Okay.

34:48.936 --> 34:50.428
Whoa!
Oh!

34:50.514 --> 34:53.783
Sorry. Hey, no worries,
no worries. All good.

34:53.983 --> 34:55.446
It was getting
a little loud in here

34:55.471 --> 34:57.672
so I rigged this up so that
I'd actually be able to know

34:57.767 --> 34:59.300
when the mass spec was finished.

34:59.429 --> 35:00.729
- Ah, genius.
- Right? Yeah.

35:00.764 --> 35:01.997
Let's see what we got here.

35:02.032 --> 35:03.444
So it looks like

35:03.545 --> 35:04.647
we do have the results

35:04.725 --> 35:06.035
from the particulates
in the axe wound.

35:06.059 --> 35:09.660
Okay. Glucose, sucrose,

35:09.685 --> 35:12.252
sodium nitrate, lipids...

35:12.509 --> 35:14.442
Hold on a second.

35:14.478 --> 35:15.758
This all looks like
a combination

35:15.782 --> 35:17.288
of sugar, syrup, and pig fat.

35:17.313 --> 35:19.335
- Why would you have sugar on an axe?
- Yeah.

35:19.483 --> 35:22.038
That's more like a
kitchen implement.

35:22.108 --> 35:25.170
Hey, Jack flap told Aubrey
he cures his own bacon.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.555
A meat cleaver would
create a marking

35:27.591 --> 35:29.967
with a similar profile
to that of an axe head.

35:30.053 --> 35:32.085
Let's cleanup,
check the Bones again.

35:32.248 --> 35:34.181
- Yeah.
- Okay.

35:35.198 --> 35:37.448
Good-bye,<i> Precioso.</i>

35:37.580 --> 35:39.567
<i>So I'm holding Nancy,</i>

35:39.603 --> 35:40.880
<i>but I just don't think
she'd have it in here</i>

35:40.904 --> 35:42.385
<i>to dismember Phyllis' body.</i>

35:42.432 --> 35:45.104
So I looked into our one
suspect with the money motive,

35:45.166 --> 35:46.975
Jack flap is about to default

35:47.010 --> 35:48.910
on a $30,000 loan
that he took out

35:48.946 --> 35:50.478
to pay for that new truck.

35:50.514 --> 35:52.158
- He paid if off two days ago.
- Okay.

35:52.202 --> 35:53.855
So he sold off the ring
and he used that money

35:53.879 --> 35:56.051
- to pay off the loan.
- If not,

35:56.086 --> 36:00.355
that would be one giant
Jack stack of a coincidence.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.459
These marks could just as easily

36:04.494 --> 36:05.527
be from a meat cleaver.

36:05.562 --> 36:06.995
Yeah, but anyone

36:07.030 --> 36:08.630
with a kitchen
could have a meat cleaver.

36:08.665 --> 36:10.732
Well, wait a second,
what is this?

36:10.767 --> 36:12.051
What is it?

36:12.129 --> 36:14.769
A scratch on the posterior
surface of the femur.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.520
Considering the width, it seems
to be from a chain saw,

36:17.637 --> 36:18.614
but it's so faint.

36:18.639 --> 36:21.176
Could it be a hesitation mark?
Chain saws are so powerful

36:21.211 --> 36:22.744
even just by touching the bone

36:22.779 --> 36:24.546
it would cause more
damage than this.

36:24.581 --> 36:26.481
Well, all the more reason

36:26.516 --> 36:28.094
- to get back to those chain saws.
- Mmm.

36:28.118 --> 36:30.385
If we could figure out
what type was used

36:30.420 --> 36:32.420
this injury might
actually make sense.

36:33.382 --> 36:36.505
The scratch on the femur
is confounding.

36:36.591 --> 36:40.606
The width and the
unique damage pattern

36:40.661 --> 36:42.197
indicate that it was made

36:42.232 --> 36:44.232
with a chain saw, but a tool

36:44.267 --> 36:46.224
with that much power
would cause more damage.

36:46.318 --> 36:49.544
Okay, let's see if we can
find the scenario that works.

36:51.645 --> 36:53.175
Okay, what if the killer

36:53.200 --> 36:56.544
only lightly touched the
bone with the chain saw?

37:00.624 --> 37:01.872
No. A moving

37:01.922 --> 37:04.466
chain saw creates an incision
that's deeper

37:04.528 --> 37:06.020
than the one we found.

37:06.045 --> 37:08.310
What if the chain saw wasn't on?

37:09.233 --> 37:10.966
Okay.

37:12.207 --> 37:13.974
No. The mark on the femur

37:13.999 --> 37:16.036
indicates that the chain was moving.
So it's not

37:16.108 --> 37:18.318
from a chain saw that was on,
and it's not from a chain saw

37:18.342 --> 37:20.542
that was off, but we know
it's from a chain saw.

37:21.224 --> 37:23.380
Hopefully that's the last time
i say chain saw today.

37:23.474 --> 37:26.808
Well, the chain was moving,
but the saw was off.

37:27.005 --> 37:28.943
It's almost as if the chain

37:28.986 --> 37:31.486
wrapped itself around
the circumference

37:31.515 --> 37:32.680
of the bone.

37:36.864 --> 37:38.631
- Stop it. That's not good.
- Let me just see.

37:38.655 --> 37:40.722
Stop it.
Let me just... let me see.

37:40.747 --> 37:43.206
No, don't touch it because
then everybody... ugh.

37:43.241 --> 37:45.028
Oh, my God.

37:45.169 --> 37:48.138
- Is everything okay?
- I'm fine. Everything is fine.

37:48.286 --> 37:49.911
- Okay, can you move your toes?
- Uh-huh.

37:49.958 --> 37:51.411
Good, now I can kill you.

37:51.455 --> 37:53.955
What... for what?
For this little scratch?

37:54.171 --> 37:55.349
What happened?

37:55.462 --> 37:58.224
He was testing that saw and
then hit a hard spot.

37:58.249 --> 38:00.451
- Ah!
- A bone of sorts.

38:00.522 --> 38:02.412
Yes, anyway,
the-the chain snapped,

38:02.437 --> 38:04.561
it whipped around the log,
and then it clipped him.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.193
Ouch.
Well, no, no, no, no.

38:06.283 --> 38:08.936
No ouch, no. I mean,
it barely even hurts.

38:09.018 --> 38:10.475
- This is it.
- This is what?

38:10.500 --> 38:12.647
This must be what happened
to the victim's femur.

38:12.696 --> 38:15.967
The scratch Rodolfo found
was from a chain saw chain.

38:16.022 --> 38:18.126
It snapped off the holder
and therefore

38:18.161 --> 38:20.592
wasn't going fast enough
to penetrate the bone.

38:20.662 --> 38:22.318
So if the chain saw snapped...

38:22.444 --> 38:24.850
Then the killer must have
a similar injury to Rodolfo.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.873
It's not an injury.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.975
- Good work, Dr. Fuentes.
- Any time.

38:29.037 --> 38:32.990
Okay. Well, I'm going to look
for hospital records.

38:34.381 --> 38:37.579
<i>Oh, Aye Dios Mio,
Y La Virgin Santo.</i>

38:41.585 --> 38:43.184
I didn't do anything.

38:43.220 --> 38:45.120
No, you just stole
Phyllis' diamond ring

38:45.155 --> 38:47.055
so you could pay
off your loan, right?

38:47.090 --> 38:48.556
But she caught you,

38:48.592 --> 38:50.108
and in doing so you killed her,

38:50.133 --> 38:52.537
and you still sold it off.
You can't prove that.

38:52.608 --> 38:54.729
Oh, but we can prove
that you chopped up her body.

38:54.764 --> 38:56.164
Why did you check in

38:56.199 --> 38:57.983
to the emergency room
last Tuesday night?

38:58.053 --> 38:59.067
I, uh...

38:59.102 --> 39:01.006
Cut myself with a kitchen knife.

39:01.084 --> 39:03.071
Had to get a few stitches.

39:03.106 --> 39:04.606
Your shin's a strange place

39:04.641 --> 39:05.873
to cut yourself
with a kitchen knife?

39:05.897 --> 39:07.694
Who said it was on my sh...
Checked out

39:07.719 --> 39:09.444
your hospital records.
I wouldn't describe

39:09.469 --> 39:11.975
22 stitches as a-a "few."

39:13.083 --> 39:15.608
That cut is from a chain saw.

39:15.633 --> 39:16.998
Almost certainly from the one

39:17.023 --> 39:19.053
you used to dismember
Phyllis' body.

39:19.089 --> 39:20.889
Our lab is tearing apart
your truck right now.

39:20.920 --> 39:21.960
It's only a matter of time

39:21.992 --> 39:23.625
before we find Phyllis' DNA,

39:23.660 --> 39:25.960
so why don't you come clean?

39:27.597 --> 39:29.483
We were joking around
doing stupid pranks,

39:29.508 --> 39:32.623
and she took it too far.
She took my truck.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.571
The truck was all I had.

39:34.654 --> 39:37.572
Okay, so-so you sold off
her engagement ring

39:37.607 --> 39:39.007
to get back at her?

39:39.042 --> 39:40.319
I heard her gabbing on her phone

39:40.343 --> 39:41.787
to her jeweler.

39:41.826 --> 39:43.556
I just knew if I could get
that ring it was my chance

39:43.580 --> 39:45.233
to pay off my debt.
She owed me.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.848
But Phyllis caught you?

39:46.883 --> 39:48.383
She was going to turn me
into the cops

39:48.418 --> 39:51.037
after everything she'd done.

39:53.623 --> 39:56.157
I'm not sorry.

39:57.678 --> 40:02.897
Without my truck,
my life was over anyway.

40:07.631 --> 40:09.537
Cam, you got a minute?

40:09.616 --> 40:11.582
- Of course.
- So...

40:11.694 --> 40:13.975
I wanted to wait until the
case was over to tell you.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.812
I found proof that Zach
didn't kill the lobbyist.

40:18.326 --> 40:20.949
Okay. I'm not gonna ask
when you found time

40:20.984 --> 40:22.295
to do this,
but what did you find?

40:22.319 --> 40:23.985
I was looking at
the lobbyist's rib.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.253
I was with Dr. Brennan

40:25.288 --> 40:27.036
when she analyzed that;
She found nothing.

40:27.061 --> 40:28.686
Within one of the stab wounds,

40:28.711 --> 40:30.458
I found the microbial signature

40:30.493 --> 40:33.092
of the killer and it is
not a match for Zach.

40:33.196 --> 40:36.412
But the chances of
a microbial signature

40:36.499 --> 40:38.733
surviving this long
are infinitesimal.

40:38.758 --> 40:40.537
Yeah, it had Anthrax in it,

40:40.594 --> 40:43.178
which is the only bacteria
that can survive this long.

40:43.273 --> 40:45.573
- That's very fortunate.
- Right?

40:45.609 --> 40:47.514
Can you believe that luck?

40:47.608 --> 40:49.310
I'm trying to.

40:49.346 --> 40:51.546
Wow, this is conclusive.

40:51.581 --> 40:54.048
And yet you don't seem excited.

40:54.084 --> 40:55.850
Well, I'm...

40:55.885 --> 40:58.286
Just a little worried

40:58.321 --> 41:00.288
that this is too good
to be true.

41:00.323 --> 41:02.857
You think I planted evidence?

41:02.892 --> 41:05.319
Look, we all know
that Zach is innocent,

41:05.350 --> 41:07.007
and that it's not fair
that he's locked up,

41:07.031 --> 41:09.029
so I can understand why

41:09.108 --> 41:11.532
doing something like that
might be tempting.

41:15.936 --> 41:18.473
And I'm sorry, but I...

41:18.701 --> 41:21.542
Can't look at evidence that
may have been tampered with.

41:23.513 --> 41:25.847
Then toss it.

41:40.130 --> 41:43.928
The radius is... 8.24 inches.

41:43.998 --> 41:44.828
Okay, let's go Bones.

41:44.898 --> 41:46.194
Let's hurry it up here.
We've been standing here

41:46.218 --> 41:47.733
waiting for you to do your stuff

41:47.758 --> 41:48.693
for, like, 20 minutes.

41:48.718 --> 41:50.171
Important to be thorough, Booth.

41:50.226 --> 41:53.101
What is the temperature of the
water in degrees celsius?

41:53.273 --> 41:54.664
- Cold.
- Cold, freezing cold.

41:54.703 --> 41:55.969
Let's go. Let's do this.
Okay, we're ready.

41:55.993 --> 41:56.773
Come on, put the stuff down.

41:56.798 --> 41:58.960
Okay, do both husband
and wife understand

41:58.985 --> 42:01.554
- the terms of the agreement?
- Oh, yes.

42:01.579 --> 42:04.385
The winner gets to
teach Christine

42:04.412 --> 42:06.256
how to ride the bike their way.

42:06.343 --> 42:09.250
Which will be me because I've
just spent the last two days

42:09.296 --> 42:11.282
- learning the physics of the sport.
- And I've been spending

42:11.306 --> 42:14.062
the last two days
enjoying the sport, huh?

42:14.156 --> 42:16.250
Your hair looks beautiful today,
I must say.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.656
It's gonna look that much better

42:17.710 --> 42:18.695
when it gets all wet.

42:18.726 --> 42:20.890
I hope your lack of scientific

42:20.915 --> 42:23.148
- strategy results in you losing.
- We'll work on that

42:23.187 --> 42:24.539
trash talking later, okay.

42:24.574 --> 42:26.741
- Are the competitors ready?
- Ready.

42:26.776 --> 42:27.975
Ready.
On your mark...

42:28.011 --> 42:29.445
Get set...

42:29.505 --> 42:30.604
Roll!

42:30.780 --> 42:33.381
Oh. Whoa, all right, huh?

42:36.286 --> 42:38.101
Whoa. What are
you doing?

42:38.171 --> 42:39.319
- Lowering the surface friction.
- Oh really?

42:39.343 --> 42:40.429
- Lower this.
- Oh.

42:40.484 --> 42:42.265
Ineffective.
I control the torque.

42:42.392 --> 42:44.425
You don't control
the torque, now, huh?

42:44.461 --> 42:46.609
Jumping is not a
traditional move in this sport.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.813
It's not? You didn't study that
one, huh? You didn't, huh?

42:48.837 --> 42:49.717
Kind of, caught you off guard?

42:49.742 --> 42:52.771
My strategy can
accommodate that.

42:53.106 --> 42:54.484
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

42:55.305 --> 43:01.171
