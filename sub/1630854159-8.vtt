♪ Get up,
we're getting ready to roll ♪

00:04.905 --> 00:08.342
What about Kilimanjaro
for the honeymoon?

00:08.342 --> 00:09.743
You mean like to climb?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.445
It's more of
a strenuous hike.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.248
Is there a beach
at the top?

00:14.248 --> 00:18.652
Ooh, I don't want to lie,
but I do want you to say yes.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.753
Morning!

00:19.753 --> 00:21.322
Morning.
Morning.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.557
I made you coffee, and
I found your special milk.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.260
Thank you. No.
No, no more special milk.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.928
No more extra pillows.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.264
Hotel Nolan
is officially closed.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.266
Two nights
is more than enough.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.868
I know. I'm back in my place
tonight, I swear.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.405
Uh, my new mattress
and white-noise machine
arrived today.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.273
I wish I had that machine
last night.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.442
That sound
was driving me crazy.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.544
I didn't notice anything.
I did.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.778
Every time I thought
it was going to stop,

00:44.778 --> 00:46.380
it just ramped
back up again.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.548
Was I snoring?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.883
No. It was much softer
than that.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.085
Like scratching.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.453
Oh, probably a raccoon.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.088
I'll check the crawl space
when I come home.

00:54.088 --> 00:56.290
What do you know about
the history of your house?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.459
I know what year
it was built.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.295
No, I mean, like,
has anyone died here?

01:01.295 --> 01:04.132
My house is not haunted.
You don't know that.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.201
The only unwanted entity
in this house,

01:07.201 --> 01:08.936
I'm looking at right now.

01:08.936 --> 01:12.540
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

01:12.540 --> 01:18.146

01:18.146 --> 01:20.781
Bah-bah-bah. Ohh.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.617
Any chance you're gonna
make it to the pediatrician
appointment today?

01:23.617 --> 01:25.986
I mean, if everyone just
confesses to their crimes,

01:25.986 --> 01:27.621
sure, but I doubt it.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.789
Well, the thing is

01:28.789 --> 01:30.824
Jack is due for
his vaccinations today.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.826
And you're usually there
to soothe him.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.229
He'll be fine. Just give him
Tylenol and cuddles.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.064
I know. I just don't want him
to feel betrayed.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.967
Like I took him to this place
he got jabbed by needles.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.002
Better he feels
<i>I</i> betrayed him?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.905
Y-Yeah.

01:44.905 --> 01:47.341
I can see who's gonna be
the disciplinarian.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.009
I got to go.

01:49.009 --> 01:51.111
Bye, honey!

01:56.617 --> 01:59.853
So, uh, I've been thinking.
Things are good between us.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.856
Yeah.
You know, we've been
through a lot,

02:02.856 --> 02:05.326
and we've come
through it stronger.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.528
I agree.

02:07.528 --> 02:11.832
So, uh, maybe it's time
to move in together.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.768
Maybe. Sure.

02:14.768 --> 02:18.272
I mean, your place
is kind of small, though.

02:18.272 --> 02:21.275
I-I know, but with
my new promotion,

02:21.275 --> 02:24.945
I could maybe afford a cardboard
box deep in the Valley.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.981
Wait. You want
to buy a house?

02:27.981 --> 02:30.951
Yeah. That's what
grownups do, right?

02:30.951 --> 02:33.654
And I know you won't go anywhere
without Tamara.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.424
So what if we got a place
with a converted garage?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.060
I'll have to
think about it.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.362
Great.
Let's talk tonight.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.231
I'll start looking
at listings.

02:43.231 --> 02:46.133
So, I think I've proven myself,
you know,

02:46.133 --> 02:47.701
with my contributions to cases,

02:47.701 --> 02:50.338
and, you know,
I-I know I'm young,

02:50.338 --> 02:53.207
but I really think that I could
really help out around--

02:53.207 --> 02:55.309
Hey, sir, I was wondering
if I could have a minute.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.677
You got 20 seconds. Go.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.212
Okay. So you remember
the diamond case, right?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.547
It was my--
my first case.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.682
Look, you're not gonna get
to the point at this rate.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.685
Okay.
I want to be a detective,

03:04.685 --> 03:06.420
and I will do anything
to make that happen.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.055
Is that it?

03:08.055 --> 03:10.057
Yes.
Alright.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.725
Shadow Harper
and Lopez today.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.527
- Hey, Tim.
- Yeah?

03:13.527 --> 03:15.396
I'm reassigning Aaron
for today.

03:15.396 --> 03:17.298
Lucy, that means
you're back on gopher duty.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.734
Okay.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.103
I could handle
one day alone.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.239
Is there some reason
you two can't ride together?

03:28.242 --> 03:30.778
Of course not.
No, sir.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.480
Good.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.317
Sorry.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.887
Um...

03:39.887 --> 03:41.455
I'll go get the gear. Okay.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.757
Officer Thorsen
reporting for duty.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.225
Grey just
signed off on it.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.627
Told you he would.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.296
I didn't realize
you wanted to be a detective.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.464
I mean, to me, it seems like
the most effective way

03:50.464 --> 03:53.100
to make sure other people
aren't railroaded like I was.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.736
'Cause the detective
that was assigned <i>my</i> case,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.105
he dropped the ball
every step of the way.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.773
Well, he <i>was</i> French.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.610
So, what, you've never seen,
like, a bad American detective?

04:02.610 --> 04:04.111
That's fair.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.646
But I do have to
warn you,

04:05.646 --> 04:08.782
being a detective is nothing
like being on patrol.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.884
The hours are brutal,

04:10.884 --> 04:13.554
and the cases are
emotionally devastating

04:13.554 --> 04:15.823
in a way that patrol
can't prepare you for.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.958
Are you sure
you want this?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.259
Yes, I'm sure.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.795
What do you say
we start with a test?
Oh.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.831
How about a game
of five questions?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.466
Okay. Let's go. Yeah.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.835
As a detective, you need to
ask the right questions,

04:27.835 --> 04:29.970
so I'll send you the first page
of a case file.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.173
You can ask us five questions
and five questions only.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.609
So think carefully about what
you need to know to solve it.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.445
Oh, I got this.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.279
Alright,
so the records get dodgy,

04:39.279 --> 04:41.849
but so far I haven't found
anyone who's died in your house.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.517
On your land
is a bigger question.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.619
Okay. I appreciate
all the hard work.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.621
I think I'm just gonna
call an exterminator.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.823
Look, I-I think you need
to broaden your understanding

04:49.823 --> 04:52.960
of what's possible.
Have you tried ayahuasca?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.428
<i>Hmm.</i>

04:54.428 --> 04:56.364
<i>You know, it really shifts
the way you see the world.</i>

04:56.364 --> 04:57.698
<i>I think
it'd be good for you.</i>

04:57.698 --> 05:00.000
<i>Is that the one that makes you
vomit uncontrollably?</i>

05:00.000 --> 05:01.134
<i>It's very cleansing.</i>

05:01.134 --> 05:02.836
<i>Yeah, I-I think
I want to keep</i>

05:02.836 --> 05:05.038
<i>my perception
the way it is.</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
So...

05:14.815 --> 05:16.617
how's single life going?

05:16.617 --> 05:18.519
It's good.
No one to complain

05:18.519 --> 05:20.821
when I watch football
all Sunday.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.657
You didn't leave
the house once?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.058
I walked Kojo.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.460
Tim, what?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.195
I spend all week outside.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.631
No, I know, but we live
in a vibrant city.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.900
There's always <i>something</i>
amazing going on.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.802
Okay, so, don't get me wrong,
I love L.A.,

05:34.802 --> 05:36.737
but it is <i>not</i>
a vibrant city, okay?

05:36.737 --> 05:40.007
It's a loosely stitched together
patchwork of strip malls.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.010
You're hopeless.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.248
<i>Hey! You busy?</i>

05:48.248 --> 05:51.519
Uh, no.
Wh-Where are you?

05:51.519 --> 05:54.187
An open house.
It was on my way to work.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.656
Uh, what do you think?

05:55.656 --> 05:56.724
It needs some work,

05:56.724 --> 05:58.058
<i>but, uh,
it's three bedrooms.</i>

05:58.058 --> 06:01.729
Yeah, I-- I can't really see
anything. Can we talk later?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.330
Okay. Love you.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.832
Yeah.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.167
Are you-- Are you and Chris,
uh, moving in together?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.269
No. Uh, it's--
I mean, he seems to
think you are.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.505
Yeah, I mean,
I don't know.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.141
He kind of sprang it on me
this morning.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.245
You guys are happy, right?

06:18.245 --> 06:20.013
Yeah.
Those are the obvious
next steps.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.115
Yeah, no, we're super happy.
It's-- It's good.

06:22.115 --> 06:25.285
<i>7-Adam-100,
I have an in-progress vandalism</i>

06:25.285 --> 06:27.287
<i>on West 3rd
south of Olympic.</i>

06:27.287 --> 06:29.457
Yeah. Show us responding.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.794
No, no, no, no!
Not the Corvette!

06:33.794 --> 06:34.795
You should've
thought of that

06:34.795 --> 06:36.029
before you flirted
with that whore!

06:36.029 --> 06:37.798
Babe! Aah!
Oh, my God.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.199
Our accountant?
She's 60!

06:39.199 --> 06:41.268
And a stone-cold fox!

06:41.268 --> 06:44.772
<i>Okay, ma'am-- ma'am,
put down the golf club.
Oh, yeah?</i>

06:44.772 --> 06:46.106
Sir, no!
Put the golf club down!

06:46.106 --> 06:47.975
You wouldn't dare!
Is this what you want?

06:47.975 --> 06:50.310
<i>Okay, that's it!
Enough! Weapons down!</i>

06:50.310 --> 06:53.080
<i>Weapon?
It's a golf club.</i>

06:53.080 --> 06:54.314
<i>Now.</i>

06:54.314 --> 06:57.117
<i>I-- Look, Officer,
this is a misunderstanding.</i>

06:57.117 --> 06:59.453
<i>Who called you?</i>
That doesn't matter.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.422
<i>It was the busybody
across the street, wasn't it?</i>

07:02.422 --> 07:04.792
I bet she's posting
on Nextdoor!

07:04.792 --> 07:06.293
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course she is.</i>

07:06.293 --> 07:08.261
<i>You know, what else has she got
in her sad little life?</i>

07:08.261 --> 07:11.665
She needs to put down the phone
and take in her garbage bins!

07:11.665 --> 07:13.333
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

07:13.333 --> 07:15.102
<i>Actually, can you guys
do something about that, huh?</i>

07:15.102 --> 07:16.504
<i>She just leaves them
out there for days.</i>

07:16.504 --> 07:18.606
<i>Not our jurisdiction.</i>

07:18.606 --> 07:20.307
Okay. Fine.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.745
Mm. So where do you want
to go for brunch?
In bed.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.947
<i>Mmm. I like the way
you're thinking.</i>

07:26.947 --> 07:29.249
Okay. Either of you want
to make a report

07:29.249 --> 07:30.918
about the damage
to your cars?

07:30.918 --> 07:32.452
At this point,

07:32.452 --> 07:34.287
<i>we have the body shop
on speed dial.</i>

07:40.594 --> 07:45.198
So, have you thought of
your first question?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.634
Yes.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.537
I already went over the file
you gave me.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.304
The remains were found
on the grounds

07:51.304 --> 07:52.840
of the La Brea Tar Pits complex,

07:52.840 --> 07:56.043
and a female guard went missing
one month prior.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.277
Correct.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.312
And it's always
the boyfriend.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.149
Okay. First question.
Was she seeing anyone?

08:02.149 --> 08:04.484
Yes. And he also worked
at the museum.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.119
A paleontologist.

08:06.119 --> 08:08.121
Oh, okay. So he had access
to the grounds.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.858
Interesting.
Did he have an alibi?

08:10.858 --> 08:12.693
No, he did not.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.127
Okay.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.463
So why haven't you and Bailey
set a date?

08:16.463 --> 08:18.966
Oh, we're enjoying
being engaged.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.468
Hm. Have something to do
with her crazy ex?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.904
Are they even divorced?

08:23.904 --> 08:25.639
Uh, yeah, they have been
for a while now.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.240
How did you
even know about that?

08:27.240 --> 08:28.709
I mean, cops gossip.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.478
Really? About me?
What else do they say?

08:31.478 --> 08:33.213
Well, they don't say, like,
anything bad.

08:33.213 --> 08:34.582
They just mention--

08:34.582 --> 08:36.483
Whoa.

08:36.483 --> 08:37.585
Light it up.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.762
Ma'am?

08:50.564 --> 08:52.933
Uh, ma'am, can you turn
the engine off for me?

08:52.933 --> 08:55.102
I can't stop. I have to
keep driving. I'm sorry.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.437
Ma'am, I need you
to stop the car.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.739
<i>What is that
around your neck?</i>

08:58.739 --> 09:00.207
<i>He made me put it on.</i>

09:00.207 --> 09:03.510
<i>He said to drive
or he'd kill me.</i>

09:03.510 --> 09:04.945
<i>Ma'am, is that a bomb?</i>

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
I have to go.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.515
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't want to die.</i>

09:08.515 --> 09:09.683
<i>I have to go.</i>

09:09.683 --> 09:11.218
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?
No. No!</i>

09:20.093 --> 09:24.397
<i>Air-3 is lifting off now.
ETA-- 5 minutes from target.</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:27.134
You made the right call. We have
to assume it's a real explosive.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.702
Coordinating with
the bomb squad now.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.470
Yes, sir.
What would you like us to do?

09:30.470 --> 09:33.273
Follow her, but stay
out of radio range.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

09:33.273 --> 09:34.808
If the bomb has
a remote trigger,

09:34.808 --> 09:38.045
our radio signal
could set it off.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.613
Dropping back.
<i>We'll clear the streets.</i>

09:39.613 --> 09:41.281
Air support's on its way.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.549
Sir, maybe we can get
a court order

09:42.549 --> 09:43.751
for all the cell carriers.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.619
Get phone numbers attached
to her home address.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.987
It's already in process.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
7-Adam-100, 2331,

09:49.056 --> 09:50.958
stand by
for victim information.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.626
Copy.
Copy.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.962
Where do you want us?
<i>Scout for a staging area.</i>

09:54.962 --> 09:56.897
Bomb squad needs
a wide-open space.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.799
We have to limit
potential casualties.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.668
There's an empty lot
near Nolan's location.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.803
Perfect.
I'll send backup to you now.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.839
So, Harper, Lopez, Nolan says
the driver's under duress.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.474
Said she was told
to keep driving

10:07.474 --> 10:08.642
or the bomb would detonate.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.443
Did he give her
a destination?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.445
No. Doesn't seem to be
about a target.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.947
<i>She's</i> the target.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.183
<i>So we need to find
whatever we can on her.</i>

10:16.183 --> 10:17.951
Whoever chose her
did it for a reason.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.820
We're on it. Nolan...

10:19.820 --> 10:22.322
bomb squad needs to know
what they're dealing with.
Can you get a picture?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.324
No problem.
Turning off radio, going dark.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.194
Want you to pull up
next to that car.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.361
Try and stay parallel.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.797
The bomb car?
Yeah.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
Okay. Getting closer
to the bomb car.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.169
Alright.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.370
Closer. Alright.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.809
Uh, it's a hinged collar
secured around her neck,

10:41.809 --> 10:43.977
kind of like handcuffs. Nolan...

10:43.977 --> 10:47.014
With quarter-twenty tapped
standoffs at regular intervals.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.148
Nolan.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.351
The explosive is built
into the side of the unit.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.821
Contains C-4. It's connected
with red and green wires.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.322
J-John!
Almost done.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.323
No, we have to fall back.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.825
I just need a better look
at the clasp.

10:57.825 --> 10:59.326
It's-- It's secured
under her chin

10:59.326 --> 11:02.696
with a pin post lock, dual-post
shackle-style mechanism.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.868
God. Did you get it?
That was some slick driving.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.369
Thanks.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.571
Okay. Hopefully,
that's all they need.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.373
I-I mean, that was
a pretty precise description.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.876
Oh, in my previous life,
I was a contractor.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
I'm surprised you remember
your past lives.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.012
Celina.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.848
I'm sorry.
Just kidding.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.315
We're on our way
to the victim's house now.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.517
I need a scrub of
all social-media posts.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.319
Thanks.
Pam's a lawyer.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.021
We should start
with her client list.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.990
I already put in a call
to her old law firm.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.691
She had
a criminal-defense practice,

11:31.691 --> 11:33.593
so there's no telling
who she pissed off.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.162
Look at you.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.097
I mean, if I want to become
detective before I'm 30,

11:37.097 --> 11:38.598
I got to be on my game, right?

11:38.598 --> 11:41.068
Does that mean you've thought
of your third question?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.936
I have, but I don't
want to just assume

11:42.936 --> 11:44.671
that the paleontologist
boyfriend did it,

11:44.671 --> 11:47.941
so I need a more complete
picture of the guard's life.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.509
Does she have
a criminal record?

11:49.509 --> 11:52.112
As a matter of fact,
she was under investigation

11:52.112 --> 11:53.513
at the time
of her disappearance.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.750
They suspected her of stealing
small artifacts from the museum

11:56.750 --> 11:58.752
and selling them
on the black market.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.120
Maybe she got greedy

12:00.120 --> 12:01.789
or threatened
to go to the police,

12:01.789 --> 12:04.992
and whoever she was working with
decided she was a liability.

12:05.959 --> 12:08.628
Is there a question
in there?

12:08.628 --> 12:09.797
Not yet.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.200
Perfect.
There's plenty of space to--

12:15.969 --> 12:17.104
Awesome, dude.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.939
Flag on the play.
Parking lot is not empty.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.440
Sgt. Grey:
<i>Clear it out now.</i>

12:20.440 --> 12:22.742
I'm redirecting the bomb squad
to your location.

12:22.742 --> 12:27.080
<i>Hey! LAPD! We need you guys
to clear out! Let's go!</i>

12:27.080 --> 12:29.582
There's a bomb!
Run like hell!

12:29.582 --> 12:30.884
Let's go!

12:32.385 --> 12:34.721
Let's roll!

12:38.358 --> 12:40.460
We have Pam's
mobile number.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.465
Hi. It's Pam, right?
My name is John.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.968
We have the bomb squad
on the way to help you out.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.302
You are gonna be okay.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.138
Right now,
I need you to follow us.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.505
Can you do that?

12:52.505 --> 12:53.807
I need to call my mom.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.475
I need to tell her
that I love her.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.778
We can do that, but right now,
I need you to follow us

12:58.778 --> 13:00.613
so we can meet up
with the bomb squad, okay?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.849
He told me
to keep driving.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.450
He said that I would die
if I didn't.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.318
Pam, that's a lie.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.155
Bomb squad says there's no GPS
on your collar, alright?

13:08.155 --> 13:09.923
He can't tell
if you're stopped or not.

13:09.923 --> 13:10.757
Are you sure?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.492
Yes.
Yes, Pam, I am sure.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.927
Now we're gonna pull out
in front of you

13:13.927 --> 13:15.328
and you're gonna
follow us, okay?

13:15.328 --> 13:16.496
Okay.

13:22.035 --> 13:25.873
<i>I have a visual.
Will maintain contact.</i>

13:25.873 --> 13:27.374
Alright, Pam.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.441
Now, I want you to park

13:28.441 --> 13:30.277
right up next
to the orange cone

13:30.277 --> 13:31.845
that Sergeant Bradford
is setting out.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.181
Okay?
Okay.

13:37.784 --> 13:41.855
Yeah, you got it.
Gonna take you to a safe spot.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.691
Alright, Pam, just checking in.
How are you doing?

13:44.691 --> 13:47.694
Um... not great.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.829
Please get this thing
off of me.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.731
That's what
we're here to do.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.803
Alright. And there they are.
Bomb squad is here.

13:56.803 --> 13:59.039
We're gonna have you
out of that in no time.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.475
Now, Pam, earlier you said you
wanted me to call your mother.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.544
Is there anyone else
you want me to get ahold of?

14:04.544 --> 14:07.647
No. Not really.

14:07.647 --> 14:08.916
Is that pathetic?

14:08.916 --> 14:11.551
Not at all.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.986
There's nothing like
a traumatic event

14:12.986 --> 14:16.990
to make you realize that your--
that your life is empty.

14:16.990 --> 14:19.659
Come on, Pam.
I don't believe that.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.363
My entire life is work.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.266
I have no friends.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.201
I'm completely alone.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.238
You're not alone, Pam.
'Cause I'm here now.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.441
Everyone here
is here to help you.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.776
I need you to cut off
your engine now, Pam.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.912
You see that guy behind you
in the doughboy suit?

14:38.912 --> 14:42.115
That's Mike. Mike is absolutely
the best there is.

14:42.115 --> 14:45.385
Alright? He's gonna get you
out of there in no time.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.620
The only problem is, uh,

14:47.620 --> 14:49.789
he tells very bad
dad jokes,

14:49.789 --> 14:52.059
so I'm gonna have to
apologize in advance.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.294
Alright.
He's there at your window.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.396
<i>It's locked.</i>

14:56.396 --> 14:58.765
I just need you to reach down
and open the door, okay, Pam?

14:58.765 --> 15:01.634
I can't.
I can't move. Hey...

15:01.634 --> 15:03.903
Yes, you can do this.
You can do this, Pam.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.139
Just take a--
take a nice deep breath.

15:06.139 --> 15:08.575
Reach down.
Unlock that door.

15:10.643 --> 15:14.547
I-I can't.
I can't. I can't.

15:14.547 --> 15:18.118
You got this.
I know as soon as I move,
this thing's gonna go off!

15:18.118 --> 15:20.787
No, come on. Come on, Pam.
It's almost over.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.921
Mike is right there.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.890
You just
need to open the door for him.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.893
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
You got this, Pam.

15:26.893 --> 15:28.728
Okay.
Okay.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.497
I'm gonna reach over.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.132
I'm gonna--

15:32.132 --> 15:34.134
I'm gonna unlock it, okay?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.903
It started beeping.

15:36.903 --> 15:38.405
Do you hear that?
Why is it beeping?

15:38.405 --> 15:40.340
It's beeping.
Why is it beeping?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.575
Uh, don't worry about that, Pam.
Just open the door, okay?

15:42.575 --> 15:43.676
Just open that door.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.126
Go get those kids
out of here!

15:59.126 --> 16:00.127
Okay.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.861
- This is crazy.
- It's crazy.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.962
Yo, this is
so crazy, yo. Wait.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.931
We were just skating.
Look, look.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.033
Look at this.
Look at this.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.934
I need you all to back up
another 10 yards.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.670
<i>Yo, Officer, what happened?
I heard a lady blew up?</i>

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
We're not sharing
any information at this time.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.640
Back up!

16:22.015 --> 16:23.150
<i>I pushed back
the perimeter.</i>

16:23.150 --> 16:24.151
<i>Good.</i>

16:24.151 --> 16:26.319
<i>Do you think
she felt it?</i>

16:26.319 --> 16:27.387
<i>Her death?
Yeah.</i>

16:27.387 --> 16:28.788
<i>No.</i>

16:28.788 --> 16:31.324
But everything up to that point
was torture.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.792
What'd the bomb squad
say?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.127
They confirmed what
we already suspected.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.628
<i>Device appears
to be homemade</i>

16:35.628 --> 16:37.397
<i>using items you can find
at any hardware store.</i>

16:37.397 --> 16:39.032
<i>Do they know what
triggered the explosion?</i>

16:39.032 --> 16:40.900
<i>Most likely, the device
was on a timer,</i>

16:40.900 --> 16:42.569
<i>but they need to put the bomb
back together to be sure.</i>

16:42.569 --> 16:44.671
<i>Ah, that's gonna be
a hell of a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

16:44.671 --> 16:47.140
<i>I'm sure videos are already
popping up on social media.</i>

16:47.140 --> 16:48.808
<i>And the news choppers
are already here.</i>

16:50.210 --> 16:52.879
Okay, well, if her car and her
license plate get leaked online,

16:52.879 --> 16:54.514
<i>it's not gonna be long
till her name does, too.</i>

16:54.514 --> 16:57.184
<i>Ohh, I can't imagine
finding out something</i>

16:57.184 --> 16:59.519
<i>about someone I love
like this on ClipTalk.</i>

16:59.519 --> 17:01.221
<i>We're not gonna
let that happen.</i>

17:01.221 --> 17:03.090
<i>Nolan, I want you and Juarez
to go to the victim's house.</i>

17:03.090 --> 17:03.956
<i>Right.</i>

17:06.359 --> 17:08.195
<i>Who would do
something like this?</i>

17:12.099 --> 17:14.201
It's officially
a homicide.

17:16.303 --> 17:18.171
Was anyone else
injured?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.340
Nothing serious.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.842
That's strange, right?

17:22.842 --> 17:25.445
I mean, bombs are usually
for mass-casualty events.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.381
If you want to kill one person,
a gun is a lot easier.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.118
They didn't just want her dead.
They wanted her terrified.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.288
Hold on. I just got video
footage from Pam's house.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.996
Can't see his face.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.001
Alright. The garage camera's
triggered 7 minutes later.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.141
Is there
any other angle?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.442
No, that's it.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.477
Wait, wait.
Go back real quick.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.613
Yeah. I feel like
she recognizes him.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.215
Yeah, she doesn't
seem scared.

18:02.215 --> 18:05.752
Whoever he is,
she wasn't expecting trouble.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.621
Alright, mother's name is
Marianne Winfield.

18:08.621 --> 18:11.424
62, works in PR, and...

18:11.424 --> 18:14.594
man, she's about to receive
the worst news of her life.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.464
Alright.
I'll do the talking.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.566
It's better
if only one of us speaks.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.967
That way,
the person can focus

18:20.967 --> 18:22.335
a little easier
on what we're telling them.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.103
Well, I can do it.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.638
You sure?

18:25.638 --> 18:28.275
I have to make my first
death notification sometime.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.344
Might as well be today.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.012
Okay.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.681
Don't speak
in euphemisms.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.650
No "passed on"
or "in a better place."

18:37.650 --> 18:39.919
Just be direct.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.421
"We have bad news.

18:41.421 --> 18:44.123
Your daughter Pam was killed
today in an explosion."

18:44.123 --> 18:45.925
You know, when the police
told my mom

18:45.925 --> 18:49.496
that they'd recovered my sister,
they said, "We found her."

18:49.496 --> 18:52.365
And for a second,
we thought...

18:53.500 --> 18:55.368
So you understand
how important this is.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.837
Yeah. I do.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.506
Okay.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.314
Celina Juarez.
This is Officer John Nolan.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.738
That poor woman.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.507
The last moments of her life
must have been agony,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.543
just wondering if the bomb
was gonna go off,

19:36.543 --> 19:37.710
praying it wouldn't.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.512
I'm guessing
that was the point.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.814
No way someone goes through
that much trouble of building

19:41.814 --> 19:44.551
something like that unless they
want to terrorize their victim.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.385
Yeah.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.989
Hey.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.324
I saw the news.
Are you okay?

19:51.324 --> 19:53.426
Yeah, I'm fine,
but it's crazy out here.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.563
Okay. Look, if you
don't have time, I get it.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.265
But a Realtor friend of mine
just slipped me a listing.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.233
<i>It hasn't been
posted online yet.</i>

20:00.233 --> 20:02.602
So, uh, if you like it,
I think we should move on it.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.571
Wow. Um, okay.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.907
Chen, chat with your boyfriend
on your own time.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.277
He's in a mood.
I'll let you go.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.512
Just text me and let me know
what you think?

20:12.512 --> 20:13.946
Yeah, I-I'll do that.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.718
Thanks.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.690
Pam Winfield was an in-house
counsel at Sunvale Oil

20:23.690 --> 20:24.957
for the past five years.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.859
Security e-mailed me
a list of people

20:26.859 --> 20:28.728
who sent threatening letters
to the company.

20:28.728 --> 20:32.432
The first guy lives
over on Orange Grove.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.966
Alright, let's go
pay him a visit.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.803
How's the Tar Pits
case going?

20:36.803 --> 20:39.306
I haven't been
thinking about it.

20:39.306 --> 20:41.441
After what happened,
it seems kind of silly.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.710
Part of being a detective
is juggling cases,

20:43.710 --> 20:47.046
switching between
wildly different gears.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.750
Okay. Um...

20:50.750 --> 20:53.953
Okay. We have the boyfriend.
We have the artifacts broker.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.289
Both have motive
to kill the guard.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.291
I-I feel like I need to know
more about the theft.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.461
Like, how did she get roped up
in this in the first place?

21:01.461 --> 21:03.496
Is that
a fourth question?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.832
Yes. Did the guard
take the job at the museum

21:05.832 --> 21:07.600
in order to gain access
to the artifacts?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.936
It's hard to say,
but we <i>do</i> know

21:09.936 --> 21:11.404
that her
black-market contact

21:11.404 --> 21:13.606
was also her
high-school sweetheart.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.242
<i>Another</i> love interest?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.345
Okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.987
This is a lot.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.190
Watching her die,
having to tell her mother.

21:31.190 --> 21:34.126
It's more than anyone should
have to deal with in a day.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.195
But our shift
isn't over yet.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.665
I know. I'm okay.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.672
Hey. Where are you?

21:45.672 --> 21:47.106
I'm under the house.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.608
Why?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.811
I keep hearing this noise,
and it's driving me crazy.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.780
And you thought
it would be a good idea

21:53.780 --> 21:55.482
to go under there
by yourself?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.816
That's why
I FaceTimed you.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.285
That's not the same.
It's not--

21:59.285 --> 22:01.488
Wait. What is that?

22:01.488 --> 22:02.822
What is what?
Aah!

22:02.822 --> 22:03.856
Bailey?

22:05.157 --> 22:06.626
Bailey?! What is what?!
Bailey!

22:06.626 --> 22:10.062
Sorry. False alarm.
It's just this guy.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.231
Oh, God!

22:12.231 --> 22:13.633
What is <i>that</i>
doing under there?

22:13.633 --> 22:16.736
I don't know.
Should I move it?
Yeah.

22:16.736 --> 22:20.072
No! No! Not till
you consult an exorcist.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.514
Look, if you don't want to
move in, just tell Chris that.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.981
That's...

22:28.981 --> 22:31.484
The question is,
<i>why</i> don't I want to move in?

22:31.484 --> 22:33.720
I don't get what the problem is.
I mean, Chris is great.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.489
We're great together.
We never fight.

22:36.489 --> 22:39.426
Maybe that's the problem.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.360
Oh, you think we should be like
that couple from this morning?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.329
No, I'm not saying that,
but-- No.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.764
But do you guys not fight

22:44.764 --> 22:46.766
because you don't
disagree on things,

22:46.766 --> 22:49.536
or because you don't think
it's worth the bother?

22:53.272 --> 22:54.741
Lucy.
Yeah?

22:54.741 --> 22:57.877
You deserve someone
who's worth the effort.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.619
What was that?

23:10.923 --> 23:11.691
He--

23:15.127 --> 23:17.730
Control, 7-Adam-100.
There is a second bomb.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.231
Repeat.
There's a second bomb.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.373
What's your name?!
Hey!
at's your name?

23:29.976 --> 23:31.744
Get me as close
as you can, okay?

23:31.744 --> 23:32.612
Right.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.147
Hey. Reach out.

23:36.282 --> 23:38.317
Reach out. Reach out. Okay.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.122
Can you get closer?
Yeah.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.290
Here, here, here.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.492
Got it!

23:48.127 --> 23:50.162
Hi. I'm Lucy.

23:50.162 --> 23:52.331
Hi. H-He told me
to keep driving.

23:52.331 --> 23:54.667
I don't want to die!

23:54.667 --> 23:57.637
Sir, we're here to help you.
What's your name?

23:57.637 --> 23:59.138
Creighton.
Creighton Mitchell.

23:59.138 --> 24:00.607
Okay. Creighton,
we're gonna try

24:00.607 --> 24:02.274
and get you to drive
somewhere safe.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.010
You think
you can do that?

24:04.010 --> 24:05.745
I can't breathe.

24:05.745 --> 24:08.414
I feel like I'm dying.
I think I'm dying.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.282
Creighton, you're probably
having a panic attack right now.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.151
I just need you
to try and stay calm.

24:12.151 --> 24:15.187
Maybe turn on the radio
for some music?

24:15.187 --> 24:17.089
<i>A woman is dead today</i>

24:17.089 --> 24:19.191
<i>after an unknown assailant
apparently strapped</i>

24:19.191 --> 24:21.160
<i>an explosive device
to her neck.</i>

24:21.160 --> 24:23.262
Oh, my God!
This happened to somebody else?!

24:23.262 --> 24:24.030
And she's dead?!

24:24.030 --> 24:24.997
Creighton,
listen to me.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.432
That is not gonna be you, okay?

24:26.432 --> 24:28.768
You can bet your ass
this isn't gonna be me!

24:33.305 --> 24:34.373
Creighton!

24:37.977 --> 24:39.145
Creighton, stop!

24:39.145 --> 24:41.480
<i>You could detonate
the device!</i>

24:41.480 --> 24:42.982
I'm not just gonna wait
for this thing

24:42.982 --> 24:45.117
to blow my head off!

24:45.117 --> 24:46.886
<i>Everyone, back up!
Get inside the house!
There's a bomb!</i>

24:46.886 --> 24:49.622
<i>Back up!
Clear it out! Clear off
the sidewalk! Let's go!</i>

24:54.861 --> 24:56.062
Ow!

24:57.496 --> 25:00.800
I'm alive!

25:06.539 --> 25:08.140
Yeah, so the bomb
was on a timer.

25:08.140 --> 25:09.576
He had 3 minutes left.

25:09.576 --> 25:11.177
<i>It's a good thing he bailed
when he did.</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:12.979
<i>We would have never
made it on time.</i>

25:12.979 --> 25:14.313
<i>How long
did he have total?</i>

25:14.313 --> 25:15.648
<i>Couldn't tell
from the device,</i>

25:15.648 --> 25:17.684
<i>but as long as he was driving
plus 3 minutes.</i>

25:17.684 --> 25:19.986
Okay, thanks. Bye.

25:19.986 --> 25:21.921
What time was the device
activated?

25:21.921 --> 25:24.490
Uh, I don't know.
Uh, a while?

25:24.490 --> 25:26.525
He activated it right before
he put me in the car.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.661
Alright, we'll get the GPS
off your car.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.830
What exactly can you
remember from this morning?

25:30.830 --> 25:32.398
<i>I was going to work.</i>

25:32.398 --> 25:34.901
<i>I-I-I heard a knock at the door
and when I answered it,</i>

25:34.901 --> 25:37.570
<i>Richard was standing there
with a collar and a gun.</i>

25:37.570 --> 25:39.872
Richard?
Dormer.
Richard Dormer.

25:39.872 --> 25:42.541
I-I used to work with
his sister at Sunvale.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.877
Oh. Sunvale Oil?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.746
Did you know
Pam Winfield?

25:46.746 --> 25:49.115
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

25:49.115 --> 25:51.517
<i>The woman they were
talking about on
the radio this morning,</i>

25:51.517 --> 25:52.752
<i>uh, that was Pam.</i>

25:52.752 --> 25:54.453
<i>What?!</i>

25:54.453 --> 25:57.924
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.
Were you close?</i>

25:57.924 --> 25:59.458
<i>I-I-I mean,
I-I worked with her.</i>

25:59.458 --> 26:01.594
<i>Wh-What is this?
What's going on?</i>

26:01.594 --> 26:04.797
<i>That's what we're trying
to figure out here.</i>

26:04.797 --> 26:06.565
<i>What did Richard
say to you?</i>

26:06.565 --> 26:08.267
<i>He told me if-- if I didn't
put the collar on,</i>

26:08.267 --> 26:09.368
<i>he'd kill me.</i>

26:09.368 --> 26:11.403
<i>And he didn't
give you any reason?</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:13.205
<i>It was all so fast.</i>

26:13.205 --> 26:14.641
<i>I-I-I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

26:14.641 --> 26:16.242
Uh, do you have
his sister's number?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.110
She might be able
to give us some insight.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.013
<i>No, no.
She's-- She's dead.</i>

26:22.815 --> 26:24.016
Do you know
what happened?

26:26.653 --> 26:28.387
<i>We...</i>

26:28.387 --> 26:30.456
<i>We sent her abroad
to handle a deal,</i>

26:30.456 --> 26:34.861
<i>and she was kidnapped
and... she was killed.</i>

26:37.163 --> 26:38.798
How were you and Pam
involved?

26:38.798 --> 26:41.333
<i>It was our call,</i>

26:41.333 --> 26:42.735
<i>whether or not
to pay the ransom.</i>

26:42.735 --> 26:44.671
<i>I mean-- And we were
going to, I-I swear.</i>

26:44.671 --> 26:46.405
But, you know,
you negotiate these things.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.075
You-- It's how you do it.
They expect you to do it.

26:49.075 --> 26:52.845
But these guys, they panicked
or-- I don't know.

26:52.845 --> 26:57.183
<i>All I know is...
she died over there.</i>

26:58.150 --> 27:00.286
7-Adam-15, I need you
to pick up Richard Dormer.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.022
Proceed with extreme caution.
He might be our bomber.

27:05.091 --> 27:06.959
Stay alert.
Watch his hands.

27:09.996 --> 27:12.464
Richard Dormer, keep your hands
where I can see them!

27:12.464 --> 27:14.466
Is this all for me?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.968
Turn around.
Get on the ground.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.204
<i>I'm unarmed.
I know how this ends.</i>

27:18.204 --> 27:19.806
I don't mind
going to prison.

27:19.806 --> 27:22.474
Turn around and get
on the ground, now.

27:25.377 --> 27:27.013
We need the bomb squad
to do a search

27:27.013 --> 27:28.447
before we process
the house.

27:28.447 --> 27:31.483
<i>You don't have to be afraid.
The explosives are gone.</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:33.485
The third bomb's
already out there.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.656
<i>Apparently there were
three people who signed off</i>

27:37.656 --> 27:39.558
on negotiating rather
than paying the ransom--

27:39.558 --> 27:40.626
Pam, Creighton,

27:40.626 --> 27:42.895
and Henri Parsons,
the company CEO.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.231
You have a phone number?
Yes, but he is not answering.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.800
Lopez is getting authorization
to track it as we speak.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.301
Alright, well,
based on Creighton's GPS,

27:49.301 --> 27:50.970
he had 43 minutes
from the time

27:50.970 --> 27:52.471
<i>the bomb was activated
until it was detonated.</i>

27:52.471 --> 27:54.406
Why 43 minutes?

27:54.406 --> 27:55.908
You're the detective.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.377
Okay. Henri drives
a black BMW 5 Series,

27:58.377 --> 27:59.578
and he lives
in Cheviot Hills.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.380
We could head up there,
drive a grid.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.015
<i>It's a start.</i>

28:04.516 --> 28:07.319
Okay. I guess we should pick up
a pair of garden shears.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.822
Don't think we can
rely on that working again.

28:09.822 --> 28:10.990
Yeah.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.495
More home listings?

28:16.495 --> 28:17.496
Yeah.

28:17.496 --> 28:18.831
Oh, you've
gotta be kidding me.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.034
This one's in Monrovia.
Who wants to live in Monrovia?

28:22.034 --> 28:24.470
It looks like Chris does.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.477
Do you love him?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.718
I mean, we haven't even
been dating that long.

28:39.718 --> 28:40.652
It's not...

28:48.127 --> 28:49.295
He loves you.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.430
I know.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.266
I know, and I feel like
I should love him back.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.468
He's so great
in so many different ways.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.637
It's just...

28:58.637 --> 29:00.672
He's just not...

29:12.351 --> 29:15.121
You know, you killed
an innocent woman today.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.755
There was nothing innocent

29:16.755 --> 29:17.957
about Pam Winfield.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.459
She got what she deserved.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.130
She experienced exactly what
she forced my sister

29:24.130 --> 29:25.898
to experience--

29:25.898 --> 29:30.837
43 minutes of terror
and then darkness.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.238
What do you mean?

29:32.238 --> 29:35.107
Where she was abducted,
where they held her,

29:35.107 --> 29:36.976
and where she died.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.145
It took 43 minutes

29:39.145 --> 29:40.913
to drive her out to the desert

29:40.913 --> 29:42.448
to be executed.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.518
<i>Kidnappers</i> killed
your sister.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.487
It wasn't Pam's fault

29:48.487 --> 29:50.256
or Creighton's fault
or Henri's!

29:50.256 --> 29:52.291
She trusted them!

29:52.291 --> 29:53.960
She believed their promises

29:53.960 --> 29:57.529
that if anything happened,
they would have her back!

30:01.968 --> 30:05.637
You know, every single person
in that company is guilty.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.139
Every single one.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.208
They all knew
she was taken,

30:09.208 --> 30:11.343
and not one person
fought for her.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.678
Not one.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.313
People she worked with
for years

30:14.313 --> 30:17.549
just sat on their hands
and let her die.

30:19.385 --> 30:21.487
Henri's not just
driving around randomly

30:21.487 --> 30:22.688
like the others,
is he?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.029
Now, I've been assuming
foul play,

30:30.029 --> 30:32.631
but maybe the victim
committed suicide

30:32.631 --> 30:36.168
or got drunk
and had an accident.

30:36.168 --> 30:39.505
Was there a question in there?
You've only got one more.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.509
No. No, there's not.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.046
Nolan,
what do we got?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.848
The third victim isn't just
randomly driving around.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.817
He's on his way
to Sunvale Oil offices.

30:51.817 --> 30:54.220
The third bomb's gonna
take out the whole company.

31:07.166 --> 31:08.500
Stay with him.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.501
Yeah.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.074
<i>Keep moving. Keep moving.</i>

31:15.074 --> 31:16.275
<i>The far side of
the parking lot. Keep--</i>

31:20.412 --> 31:22.614
<i>Control, 7-Adam-15.
I've located our third victim.</i>

31:22.614 --> 31:24.951
<i>Corporate offices, Sunvale Oil.
He's confirmed on site.</i>

31:29.355 --> 31:31.690
<i>Nolan's inside
with the bomb.</i>

31:31.690 --> 31:33.092
We need to clear
the building.

31:41.968 --> 31:43.635
We need you to clear out. Move.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.137
Everyone, listen up!

31:45.137 --> 31:46.973
We have a credible threat
at this location!

31:46.973 --> 31:49.141
<i>I need everyone
to move with purpose!</i>

31:49.141 --> 31:50.642
<i>Come on. Everybody
move quickly but stay calm.</i>

31:50.642 --> 31:52.111
Let's go. This way.
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.612
Let's spread out and make sure
there are no stragglers.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.617
Mr. Parsons. Mr. Parsons.
Hey. I'm John Nolan.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.919
<i>Help me.
Please help me.</i>

32:00.919 --> 32:03.255
That's why I'm here.
That's why-- What's this?

32:03.255 --> 32:05.624
He-- He told me
to stream an apology.

32:05.624 --> 32:07.659
Okay. First, we're gonna get
all these people out of here.

32:07.659 --> 32:09.395
<i>Folks, come on.
We're gonna move outside.</i>

32:09.395 --> 32:11.563
No. He told me
not to let them go.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.232
He said he'd kill me
if they left.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.934
<i>Relax. Okay? No-- You've been
told a lie. Okay, folks?</i>

32:15.934 --> 32:18.670
The bomber is right now
outside in my car.

32:18.670 --> 32:22.408
I can guarantee he does not have
a remote trigger with him.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.909
This bomb is on a timer.

32:23.909 --> 32:24.943
<i>You're sure?</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:26.512
<i>100%.
Nice and safe, guys.</i>

32:26.512 --> 32:27.313
<i>Everyone move outside.</i>

32:27.313 --> 32:28.414
Downstairs.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.348
The far side
of the parking lot

32:29.348 --> 32:30.482
as fast as you can, alright?

32:30.482 --> 32:31.984
Quick and safe.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.986
<i>How long ago did he put
this bomb on your neck?</i>

32:33.986 --> 32:35.454
<i>Huh? Uh...
You gotta think, okay?</i>

32:35.454 --> 32:38.024
<i>The timer is for 43 minutes,
so you have to think.</i>

32:38.024 --> 32:40.159
How long ago did he put this
on your neck?

32:40.159 --> 32:41.193
Uh... uh...

32:41.193 --> 32:43.329
More than a half-hour.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.963
Uh, maybe 40 minutes?

32:44.963 --> 32:48.434
Okay. That's... not great.
It could be worse.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.603
<i>Everyone out!
Come on, ladies. Move, move!</i>

32:51.603 --> 32:52.804
What about me?

32:52.804 --> 32:56.375
You and I, we're gonna
focus on this bomb, okay?

32:56.375 --> 32:58.344
<i>Let's take a look here,
see what we've got, alright?</i>

32:58.344 --> 33:00.179
<i>Stay nice and calm
for me.</i>

33:00.179 --> 33:02.781
Tell me how to
disarm the bomb.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.050
No.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.617
My T.O. is up there,

33:05.617 --> 33:07.853
and he's not gonna leave
someone who is scared and alone.

33:07.853 --> 33:10.056
If that bomb goes off,
you're killing him, too.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.058
Yeah, well, he's making
a choice to stay.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.659
And you're making a choice
to kill people.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.028
There have to be
consequences!

33:16.028 --> 33:19.331
My sister is dead.
They need to pay.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.833
Look, I get it.
<i>This is the hinge point.</i>

33:21.833 --> 33:24.703
My little sister was taken away
from me a long time ago,

33:24.703 --> 33:26.004
and I spent
most of my life

33:26.004 --> 33:27.473
thinking of all
the different ways

33:27.473 --> 33:29.141
I would hurt
the person responsible.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.977
But all that hate
just ate away at me

33:31.977 --> 33:34.012
until I didn't
recognize myself.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.348
Your sister
wouldn't want this.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.150
<i>Okay.</i>

33:38.150 --> 33:41.153
<i>This is entirely smooth.
I can't get in from the back.</i>

33:41.153 --> 33:43.722
I want my apology.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.192
I want him to admit
what he did

33:46.192 --> 33:48.394
for the whole world
to hear.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.661
Where does this go?

33:49.661 --> 33:51.230
Is the bomb squad coming?

33:51.230 --> 33:52.731
Yeah, any minute now.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.233
I only have a couple
of those left.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.534
"We."

33:55.534 --> 33:57.503
I'm staying with you
till we figure this out.

33:59.438 --> 34:00.772
<i>The floor is clear.</i>

34:00.772 --> 34:03.109
<i>We should go.
The bomb squad is almost here.</i>

34:04.310 --> 34:05.444
<i>John?</i>

34:05.444 --> 34:07.045
<i>Go.</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:09.615
<i>You don't
have to do this.</i>

34:09.615 --> 34:11.283
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

34:11.283 --> 34:12.951
<i>Harper, go.</i>

34:22.861 --> 34:24.296
<i>Not a good time.</i>

34:24.296 --> 34:26.432
Richard says he'll tell us
how to disarm the bomb

34:26.432 --> 34:28.033
if Parson just admits
what he did.

34:28.033 --> 34:30.802
I didn't do anything.
I was negotiating.

34:30.802 --> 34:34.740
Hey. Your semantics are
gonna get us both killed.

34:37.042 --> 34:38.310
I'm sorry.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.247
<i>We let her die.
It was my fault.</i>

34:41.247 --> 34:42.814
I made the call.

34:42.814 --> 34:45.784
Susan Dormer is dead
because of me.

34:51.757 --> 34:55.627
There's two wires in the back,
a red and a green one.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.264
Cut the green wire.

35:07.139 --> 35:09.675
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

35:09.675 --> 35:10.742
He's lying.

35:10.742 --> 35:11.977
What?

35:11.977 --> 35:14.313
He doesn't want an apology.
He wants Parsons dead.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.347
Cut the red one.

35:22.788 --> 35:23.955
Are you sure?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.291
Yes.

35:30.262 --> 35:32.998
Okay. Nice and easy.

35:43.242 --> 35:47.045
<i>Thank you.
And... thank</i> you.

35:47.045 --> 35:48.514
<i>You saved my life today.</i>

35:48.514 --> 35:52.484
<i>That kind of insight
in a rookie is... remarkable.</i>

35:55.554 --> 35:56.722
You know, I...

35:56.722 --> 35:59.325
I wouldn't be
making so much progress

35:59.325 --> 36:01.092
without
such a great T.O.

36:02.528 --> 36:03.662
Thank you again.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.631
You know,
I wouldn't mind at all

36:05.631 --> 36:08.667
if you repeated that
in front of Sgt. Grey.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.703
Just saying, repeating things
is good in general.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.306
Sgt. Grey, imagine--
Have you seen "Inception"?

36:14.306 --> 36:15.807
I'll walk you through it.

36:15.807 --> 36:19.010
Okay, so, I think
I solved your case.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.812
You have one more question
you could ask.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.047
Nope.
Don't need it.

36:22.047 --> 36:24.916
Hmm. Cocky.
Alright, let's hear it.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.219
Okay, so, the victim was dating
one of the scientists

36:27.219 --> 36:29.054
who worked at the Tar Pits, right?

36:29.054 --> 36:31.323
And she was part
of a smuggling ring

36:31.323 --> 36:33.191
that sold artifacts
on the black market.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.428
So, was it
a jealous lover

36:36.428 --> 36:39.197
or a criminal enterprise
gone wrong?

36:40.566 --> 36:42.501
Actually, it was both.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.036
She was sleeping with both
the smuggler and the scientist,

36:45.036 --> 36:48.307
and they found out
and they killed her together.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.279
I think you have a <i>long</i> road
to detective, Officer Thorsen.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.113
Wait.
Was I at least close?

36:55.113 --> 36:56.915
You had
five questions.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.183
Right.

36:58.183 --> 37:00.852
And you never asked
the <i>a</i> of the remains.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.788
Well, no, no, no.
The-- The-- The file said

37:02.788 --> 37:04.623
that she was 32
when she went missing.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.926
Right, but the bone
was thousands of years old.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.928
You see, the Tar Pits
are constantly

37:09.928 --> 37:11.563
turning up
ancient remains.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.599
So in-- in this case,

37:13.599 --> 37:16.668
the killer was
a-a saber-toothed tiger.

37:18.604 --> 37:20.071
Wait. What happened
to the missing guard?

37:20.071 --> 37:23.309
Oh, she was found
in Mexico a year later.

37:23.309 --> 37:26.077
You see, you assumed
that there was a connection

37:26.077 --> 37:29.214
between the female remains
and the missing woman. Yeah.

37:29.214 --> 37:33.319
First rule of investigation--
Don't make assumptions.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.794
Oh.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.434
Looks like a toy store
threw up in our house.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.068
Well, Jack got
two shots today.

37:50.068 --> 37:52.404
I didn't want him to
associate me with needles.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.440
Did he cry?

37:54.440 --> 37:56.107
No.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.410
Did <i>you</i> cry?
That's irrelevant.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.680
Not according to
our living room, it's not.

38:01.680 --> 38:04.483
Doesn't Jack already have
a basketball hoop?

38:04.483 --> 38:07.653
Well, yeah, but now
he's got an outside one

38:07.653 --> 38:09.755
<i>and</i> an inside one...

38:15.394 --> 38:18.430
Ohh.

38:18.430 --> 38:21.132
I don't know how you deal with
watching him get shots so often.

38:21.132 --> 38:24.536
Well, I know
it's for his own good.

38:24.536 --> 38:28.173
I know I have to be tough
to show him how to be tough.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.711
And... I fill him full of
ice cream right after.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.981
Oh, you didn't tell me
<i>that</i> trick.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.951
Because you want
to be his favorite.

38:39.951 --> 38:42.320
I'm already his favorite.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.122
Let me guess.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.791
Chris wants to buy
a house in Chatsworth?

39:52.791 --> 39:55.060
No.

39:55.060 --> 39:59.264
Look, this clearly
isn't working out.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.933
I don't know why
you won't just admit it.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.235
Unless-- Is it guilt?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.804
Is it because of
what Rosalind did to him?

40:05.804 --> 40:07.939
Oh, like I'm the only one
that's stayed too long

40:07.939 --> 40:09.741
when things
aren't working.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.242
You dated
a lifeguard.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.878
You don't even like
going to the beach.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.279
This isn't about me.
Uh--

40:14.279 --> 40:15.614
No, it's not.
This is not about me.

40:15.614 --> 40:16.915
This is about you... Okay.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.951
...staying in this
safe relationship...

40:19.951 --> 40:20.986
because you're scared.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.555
Of course I'm scared.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.791
If we do this
and it doesn't work,

40:25.791 --> 40:26.925
I'll have ruined

40:26.925 --> 40:28.827
the most important
relationship in my life.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.096
♪ Never trust a man

40:31.096 --> 40:34.933
♪ I'm scared to go home

40:34.933 --> 40:39.771
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said, um--
No. Um...

40:39.771 --> 40:41.907
You're right.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.576
So we should just keep going
the way we have been, right?

40:44.576 --> 40:46.177
It's not worth the risk.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.747
♪ I'm working on safe

40:48.747 --> 40:50.749
♪ I'm working on plan

40:50.749 --> 40:52.183
Unless it is.

40:53.519 --> 40:59.725
♪ Life is just adjusting
to the dealer's latest hand ♪

41:01.660 --> 41:04.129
Do you want to get dinner
sometime?

41:06.131 --> 41:07.432
Yes.

41:07.432 --> 41:09.300
Yeah?
Yeah.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.302
No. Uh...

41:11.302 --> 41:13.138
I-- S-- Oh.
Okay.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.306
No, no.
It's just, um...

41:17.075 --> 41:20.045
Not yet.

41:20.045 --> 41:23.649
I owe it to Chris to end things
the right way with him.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.019
Ask me again.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.855
Later. After.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.158
Deal.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.266
