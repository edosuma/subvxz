WEBVTT

00:09.677 --> 00:12.344
-Where's garaboski?
-Uh-oh.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.779
-Did we do it?
-Did we finally break him?

00:13.781 --> 00:15.247
You broke him.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.448
(all cheering)

00:16.450 --> 00:19.318
Quiet! Mr. Garaboski
retired yesterday.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.587
(all cheering)

00:21.588 --> 00:23.855
Quiet! The guy survives
vietnam and mrs. Garaboski,

00:23.858 --> 00:26.225
And he can't get past you.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.363
Now, he left a letter here
that expressed his feelings.

00:32.433 --> 00:33.832
"dear you little--"

00:33.834 --> 00:35.234
Okay, i can't read this.

00:37.304 --> 00:40.239
He always talked about
the good old days
before 1985.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.842
What happened in 1985?

00:42.843 --> 00:45.444
That was the year the new york
board of education said you
couldn't hit a kid with a ruler.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.213
"bored" of education?
I do believe i am.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.384
Well, now you're gonna need
a new english teacher.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.370
That's okay, thanks.

00:54.371 --> 00:56.355
Uh, i don't know, maya.
You may want to consider
this one.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.390
(rock music playing)

01:00.428 --> 01:03.362
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome ms. Harper burgess.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.268
You got a bike
that goes with that outfit?

01:10.404 --> 01:14.239
1800 cc twin cam fat bob
fuel tank wide glide.

01:14.241 --> 01:15.941
What do you ride?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.709
He rode a sheep.

01:20.014 --> 01:25.350
62-pound quad hoof
white fleece, kind you count
before you fall asleep. Baa baa.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.421
Wanna race?

01:29.423 --> 01:30.489
No.

01:33.294 --> 01:37.463
Ms. Burgess is here to teach
you about great books
and great ideas.

01:37.465 --> 01:40.265
Please give her
the same respect
that you give me.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.768
Oh, we could do better
than that.

Frank miller,
<i>the dark night returns.</i>

02:43.430 --> 02:44.696
This is batman.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.498
A future batman.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.566
What's the difference?

02:47.568 --> 02:49.501
This story is
the continuation

02:49.503 --> 02:51.803
Based on an original
series of characters.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.406
Do you guys
know what that means?

02:54.408 --> 02:55.741
All: Yeah.

02:56.944 --> 03:00.012
Um, aren't you supposed
to be teaching us
the important books?

03:00.014 --> 03:04.383
Mmm, this graphic novel
was as important to its
style of literature

03:04.385 --> 03:06.685
As any book you can think of.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.920
What's it about?

03:07.922 --> 03:10.489
It's about a world
that's become so tough

03:10.491 --> 03:12.524
That batman fights superman.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.861
You will tell me
why he does that.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.397
You're gonna start
by teaching us a comic book,

03:18.399 --> 03:21.050
Miss motorcycle?

03:21.051 --> 03:23.702
Yeah, and you're gonna start
by not calling me miss anything.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.637
You can call me
harper.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.473
-Harper?
-Yes?

03:28.475 --> 03:29.575
I just wanted to see
if it would work.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.377
Farkle?

03:32.379 --> 03:33.912
You know my name, harper?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.581
I know all of your names.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.116
Mr. Matthews told me
all about you.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.685
When is this due, please?

03:39.687 --> 03:40.986
Hi, riley.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.454
Hi.

03:43.490 --> 03:44.690
How do you like
having him here?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.425
It's terrible.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.393
It's wonderful.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.896
My father gave me
my love of books.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.097
He did?

03:52.099 --> 03:53.732
He's why i became
a teacher.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.634
It's why he named
me harper.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.637
You'll figure it out.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.341
Riley, stop me right now.

04:02.342 --> 04:04.075
-From what?
-I can't like
a teacher, i'm maya.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.011
It's a good day, maya.

04:06.013 --> 04:09.514
School got better and now
nothing bad is ever going
to happen again.

04:09.516 --> 04:11.750
So, i'm passing by
your classroom

04:11.752 --> 04:13.452
On this, your first day,

04:13.454 --> 04:15.153
And i can't help noticing

04:15.155 --> 04:17.489
That somebody has a comic book--

04:17.491 --> 04:19.858
That everybody has a comic book.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.560
They're graphic novels.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.594
Pipe down, farkle.

04:22.596 --> 04:25.597
I think harper's trying
to teach us something important.

04:25.599 --> 04:26.999
Oh, harper is?

04:27.001 --> 04:29.468
Hm? Well, she's not.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.837
It isn't literature,
it's comic books.

04:31.839 --> 04:34.439
Which are against
school policy, miss burgess.

04:34.441 --> 04:38.043
And so is calling miss burgess
by her first name.

04:39.513 --> 04:43.482
You will gather these up,
and you will teach something
important.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.785
<i>To kill a mockingbird?</i>

04:46.787 --> 04:48.053
Are you familiar
with this?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.621
I know this book.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.556
Then teach it, miss burgess.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.533
So...

05:03.604 --> 05:05.671
<i>The dark knight returns.</i>

05:07.541 --> 05:09.041
Read it tonight,

05:09.043 --> 05:12.577
And tomorrow we will
learn something important.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.013
(all cheering)

05:15.015 --> 05:16.648
Ah, stop it.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.517
You're not supposed
to like a teacher.

05:18.519 --> 05:19.651
You're maya.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.487
Oh, no, what are you
doing to me?

05:29.263 --> 05:30.662
Girls,

05:30.664 --> 05:32.631
Slow down.
What is the rush?

05:32.633 --> 05:34.566
Dinner is keeping us
from our homework.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.670
The new english teacher
wants us to read this.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.805
Well, this looks like
a comic book.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.223
Yes.

05:41.224 --> 05:42.640
Didn't we have a teacher
who taught us--

05:42.643 --> 05:43.508
Yes.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.545
Tell me more about
this new english teacher.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.080
-Motorcycle.
-Leather jacket.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.482
Sounds familiar.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.883
Weren't you on the committee
to hire the new english teacher?

05:55.956 --> 05:56.989
Yes.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.023
Principal yancy
doesn't like her very much.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.591
She's a young idealist.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.176
You think she's gonna
win him over.

06:01.177 --> 06:02.760
I'm just looking
for a little action.

06:04.665 --> 06:06.698
Not all history
repeats, cory.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.533
Why, what happened
to you guys?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.302
Well, we had
a pretty cool
teacher once.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.970
Feeny!

06:14.041 --> 06:16.975
No, we actually had
one other teacher.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.744
Did that teacher
get along with
the principal?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.663
Feeny was the principal.

06:20.664 --> 06:22.581
Feeny taught you
every year and was also
your principal?

06:22.583 --> 06:24.182
Yes.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.752
That would never happen today.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.153
We'll see.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.623
Our principal won't
let her teach us this.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.108
But she is anyway?

06:33.109 --> 06:34.592
It's a more
complicated world now.

06:34.595 --> 06:37.629
Heroes and villains
aren't as easily recognized.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.832
Maybe it takes
different teaching methods
to tell them apart.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.669
She thinks this will help,
and i like that she believes
in something.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.638
But cory, the world isn't
so different that the principal

06:46.640 --> 06:48.039
Doesn't still make
the final decision.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.708
Yeah, that's interesting,
isn't it?

06:49.710 --> 06:52.277
Yancy has a lot of power.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.012
He's like...

06:54.014 --> 06:56.848
Who's a guy with
a lot of power, girls?

06:58.318 --> 06:59.951
Superman.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.753
Whoa.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.357
-Then harper's like--
-batman!

07:05.359 --> 07:06.758
Whoa!

07:07.694 --> 07:09.594
What's the difference
between the two?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.363
Well, one has superpowers
and one doesn't.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.898
Well, how can that
be a fair fight?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.900
I mean, that's like a fight
between you and me.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.136
I know.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.306
You know,
i don't want harper...

07:21.308 --> 07:22.641
-Batman.
-...To lose.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.778
Well, maybe you should
do your homework and find out
what happens next.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.381
(giggles) yeah,
like they're gonna run--

07:32.719 --> 07:34.820
This is gonna be real trouble,
isn't it, cory?

07:34.822 --> 07:36.154
I hope so.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.728
Can good change?

07:43.730 --> 07:45.230
Good is good.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.549
Can evil change?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.867
It seems like just
when we think we've seen
the worst that there can be,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.636
Somebody comes up
with something.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.904
Why do you suppose that is?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.207
Because it's evil
that fascinates us.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.242
But doesn't good
have to win in the end?

07:57.244 --> 07:58.643
Does it?

08:00.013 --> 08:02.414
So i'm passing by your classroom
on this, your second day,

08:02.416 --> 08:04.282
And i see no  <i> mockingbird.</i>

08:04.284 --> 08:06.351
But i still see comic books.

08:06.353 --> 08:09.087
Yes, we're studying
the nature of good and evil.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.822
(gasps)
i don't care.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.824
-Class dismissed.
-Excuse me?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.359
Study hall, all of you!

08:14.361 --> 08:17.229
Except farkle. You...
Go sit in a garbage can.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.731
Yay!

08:20.667 --> 08:22.434
Leave now.

08:24.404 --> 08:25.770
Go.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.739
-Riley.
-Yes.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.350
If i may explain
my lesson plan.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.285
Oh, there's no need,
miss burgess. You're fired.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.788
You are brand-new, kid.

08:43.790 --> 08:46.858
You think there are heroes
and villains? There aren't.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.227
There are only kids
who come and go.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.164
You really think that
you've affected anybody?

08:56.103 --> 08:57.269
Uh...

08:57.271 --> 08:59.104
What's going on here?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.939
I've been fired.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.041
I want to thank you
for believing in me.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.876
You're welcome.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.977
Oh, wait.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.312
That hasn't changed.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.398
Uh...

09:09.399 --> 09:11.483
How can you possibly fire
someone like her, yancy?

09:11.485 --> 09:13.184
Go back to your class, matthews.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.987
You're right, this isn't
history, this is english, but...

09:16.924 --> 09:18.990
You know what history
has in common with
the great books?

09:20.027 --> 09:21.493
It turns out

09:21.495 --> 09:23.128
There are heroes
and villains.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.930
All through them.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.800
And the villains will
always cause trouble.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.136
But there's always
gonna be heroes
to fight back.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.971
You ruined my
entire lesson.

09:32.973 --> 09:36.074
She was hired
to teach literature,
but she's not.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.277
She rides a motorcycle
and she teaches comic books.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.379
How is that a teacher?

09:41.381 --> 09:43.214
That can be
a great teacher.

09:43.216 --> 09:47.152
A passionate teacher
who doesn't believe
that kids just come and go.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.355
And if you let her go, then...

09:50.357 --> 09:52.924
You have to be prepared
to let me go as well.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.327
Let  <i> you  </i> go?

09:56.863 --> 09:58.863
[exhales] well, i wasn't
prepared for that at all.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.932
Just give me a second--

10:00.934 --> 10:02.367
Okay, i'm good.
You're fired, too.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.779
How was everybody's
day today?

10:14.781 --> 10:15.947
It was a good day

10:15.949 --> 10:17.816
And then my friends
treated me nicely

10:17.818 --> 10:19.017
And then my teacher
measured me,

10:19.019 --> 10:22.287
And i'm growing,
and then jenny lewis loves me.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.957
Wait a minute,
this already happened.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.927
Yeah, i'm out of stuff.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.831
He's right.
Nothing new happened at all.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.432
Dad got fired today.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.902
(chuckles nervously)
well, there's that.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.206
You know how you thought
there might be trouble

10:41.208 --> 10:42.941
Between yancy
and the new teacher?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.409
The young idealist
who was gonna win him over?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.878
She didn't... So much.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.413
But you defended her?

10:48.415 --> 10:49.914
-I did.
-So yancy fired you?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.816
So much.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.319
Yancy can't fire you.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.821
According to statue 3028,
teacher dismissals have
to come from the state.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.056
Mom, do you know everything?

10:58.058 --> 10:59.190
Yeah.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.160
So mr. Matthews is safe?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.829
Aw, maya... You care?

11:05.599 --> 11:07.532
No, i just haven't
spoken yet.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.002
I've met principal yancy.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.237
He can be pretty stubborn.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.205
Yeah, he's gonna
pursue this.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.607
What will we do next?

11:15.609 --> 11:18.260
Well, he has to take it
to his boss.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.912
He has to take it
to the superintendent
of schools.

11:23.583 --> 11:26.017
Doesn't that make
you guys nervous?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.253
Um, they don't seem nervous.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.261
Today's lesson.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.214
Okay.

11:39.215 --> 11:41.232
So i've learned
it's more difficult to get
rid of rabble rousers

11:41.234 --> 11:42.367
Than i thought.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.936
Too bad for you,

11:44.937 --> 11:47.504
I've got a great relationship
with the superintendent
of schools.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.040
(chuckles)

11:49.042 --> 11:50.875
How's your
relationship, matthews?

11:58.251 --> 12:00.251
Okay, so why do i
have to do anything?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.289
Mr. Turner and i
go back a bit.

12:04.291 --> 12:07.459
So, i hear you want
to dismiss a couple
of educators, yancy?

12:07.461 --> 12:10.061
She's here one day,
and she's teaching comic books!

12:10.063 --> 12:12.931
Yeah, my first day
i taught  <i> the   x-men.</i>

12:12.933 --> 12:15.066
(chuckles)

12:15.068 --> 12:16.301
That's funny.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.071
Oh, no!

12:21.908 --> 12:24.142
Now, why would i do that,
i wonder?

12:24.144 --> 12:26.077
Matthews?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.011
Well, you took characters
we already loved to show us

12:28.014 --> 12:30.281
That good and evil
wasn't always so
black and white.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.050
-How come?
-So we'd understand
it better when

12:32.052 --> 12:33.351
You taught us real books.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.386
Cory, you were listening.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.307
How could i not?

12:39.308 --> 12:41.358
I mean, you wore
a leather jacket
to work every day.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.527
You taught comic books

12:42.529 --> 12:44.963
And you rode to work
on a motorcycle.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.970
Right up until
the day the bike and i
both got totaled.

12:51.972 --> 12:55.406
But things happen for a reason.
I married my nurse.

12:55.408 --> 12:56.941
Aw.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.443
You fell in love with her?

12:58.445 --> 13:00.111
Nah, in case it ever
happens again.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.279
I--

13:03.583 --> 13:06.518
There's a pretty cool bike
parked next to your
sensible sedan.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.053
What, did you buy that
from feeny?

13:11.191 --> 13:13.024
Well, it only had
four miles on it.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.962
The roll-up windows
are a real workout.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.366
Hey, burgess,

13:21.368 --> 13:24.102
You be careful
on that bike, okay?

13:28.008 --> 13:29.691
Thank you, sir.

13:29.692 --> 13:31.375
Jon, i just wanted her to teach
<i>to kill a mockingbird.</i>

13:32.612 --> 13:33.978
Your mom or your dad?

13:35.115 --> 13:36.047
My dad.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.348
What about him?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.484
He named her
harper lee burgess.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.086
I figure she'll get
around to it.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.422
Isn't this the one
about understanding

13:44.424 --> 13:47.492
That people turn out
pretty good if you give
them a chance?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.427
Don't ask me,
i read comic books.

13:51.698 --> 13:52.997
Look, yancy,

13:52.999 --> 13:55.500
I'll observe harper's class,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.101
I'll make my decision then.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.470
I already made my decision
on matthews long ago.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.107
I hired him, you know?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.044
I did not know that.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.646
I withdraw my objection.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.281
Too late for that.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.951
Too important.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.620
What a kid is taught
is what a kid becomes.
That's the job we have.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.490
You ask me to see
how it's being done,
and i will.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.295
Hmm.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.198
Interesting lesson.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.567
Let's see what comes of it.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.077
We have some special guests
in our classroom.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.745
Please behave as you
normally would.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.046
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.481
We love harper.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.149
Do you understand,
uncle jon?

14:45.151 --> 14:47.185
Real uncle, or do you
just call him that?

14:47.187 --> 14:49.153
He comes over like
a million times a week--

14:52.626 --> 14:53.725
I withdraw my complaint.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.825
You got them calling you
by your first name?

14:54.828 --> 14:58.129
S, i wanted them to put
gether the  <i> mockingbird  </i> thing

14:58.131 --> 15:01.266
To see how much i care
about what i'll be teaching.

15:01.268 --> 15:05.169
All right, does anybody
understand the significance
of harper's name

15:05.171 --> 15:08.172
In regards to the author
of  <i> to kill a mockingbird?</i>

15:09.175 --> 15:11.276
Harper's first name
is charles twain!

15:13.446 --> 15:15.346
You're doing a bang-up job
with her, matthews.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.117
Look, she was told
by the principal not to
teach us something,

15:19.119 --> 15:21.119
But she did anyways.
That's gotta mean something.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.121
Psst, will you stop
helping us?

15:24.257 --> 15:26.190
Yeah, it means something.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.393
Now, may i see
what you've learned?

15:28.395 --> 15:31.396
Because that's
what means everything.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.464
Farkle goes first,
farkle always goes first!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.768
Stuart minkus' kid?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.136
-Yeah.
-Super genius?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.470
-Outer space.
-Real human boy?

15:39.472 --> 15:40.605
We're not sure yet.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.106
Sit down.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.676
I'll make the presentation.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.244
You like this teacher?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.478
I like both of these teachers.

15:47.480 --> 15:48.813
Are you familiar
with the material?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.682
Me? No, i never saw
this thing before.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.283
I never saw this thing
before in my life.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.786
Yeah, i read it.
I read it, actually,
a lot.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.289
Thanks for telling the truth.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.326
Yeah, i can't
help myself. (sighs)

16:01.328 --> 16:04.562
Now, i prefer someone
who is unfamiliar with
the material.

16:04.564 --> 16:09.334
Someone who is
notoriously unteachable.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.904
How you doin'?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.575
Not you, riley.

16:17.577 --> 16:18.910
I only looked
at the pictures.

16:18.912 --> 16:20.211
I read the words.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.546
It's a duet.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.349
I hope you learned
something, girls.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.317
I learn something
all the time.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.752
I come here
because my apartment leaks.

16:28.788 --> 16:29.921
Come here.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.322
Yes...?

16:33.193 --> 16:35.326
I know you just
say this stuff.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.262
I know you're a lot
smarter than you want
us to know.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.464
Shh.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.233
We got this.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.634
I hope so.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.303
Our future's in your hands.

16:51.644 --> 16:54.212
In frank miller's
<i>the dark night returns</i>

16:54.214 --> 16:56.180
The keyword is dark.

16:56.182 --> 17:00.418
He doesn't write
heroes or villains
that you are used to.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.922
You have to really think
about what's right
and what's wrong.

17:04.924 --> 17:07.291
The pictures
make you work, too.

17:07.293 --> 17:10.361
You have to look
up, down, across,
and sideways,

17:10.363 --> 17:14.265
But i believe he's trying
to get us to look at
what our own world has become.

17:14.267 --> 17:17.268
Up, down, across,
and sideways.

17:18.304 --> 17:21.372
Heroes that should be friends
with a common goal,

17:21.374 --> 17:24.058
Fight each other
instead.

17:24.059 --> 17:26.743
One hero was trying
to inspire his old friend
to take a look at the world,

17:26.746 --> 17:28.379
And realized
that it's changed.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.782
So, he needed
to change, too.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.418
But he wouldn't,

17:33.420 --> 17:34.986
So he fought
against him.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.754
Which was hard to look at,

17:36.756 --> 17:38.456
Because the world
is dark enough

17:38.458 --> 17:40.658
And heroes
are supposed to bring light.

17:41.661 --> 17:45.396
Everyone in this room
knows that someone
with real power

17:45.398 --> 17:48.900
Doesn't need to hit a kid
with a ruler to get the kid
to want to learn.

17:48.902 --> 17:51.769
Because this is a new world,
and we don't do that here.

17:53.406 --> 17:57.308
Frank miller turned
a comic book into--
what's the word?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.242
You know the word.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.610
Literature.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.947
And harper here,

18:02.949 --> 18:06.484
Is named after someone
who gave us a great story.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.888
Which her father taught her
to appreciate,

18:10.890 --> 18:13.324
And it means everything to her

18:13.326 --> 18:15.393
That her father taught her.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.595
She's taught me
so much already.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.264
You did that
in two days?

18:20.266 --> 18:21.632
(laughs)

18:21.633 --> 18:22.999
They're smarter
than they want us
to know.

18:23.002 --> 18:24.702
She did that
in two days!

18:24.704 --> 18:26.304
Shape up, matthews.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.474
Yes, sir.

18:29.476 --> 18:33.010
Jon, comic books
are against school policy.

18:33.012 --> 18:36.881
Yeah, and you can hit
a kid with a ruler
in 19 states.

18:43.690 --> 18:46.724
Hey, matthews, i know
it was you that chose
harper for these kids.

18:46.726 --> 18:51.362
Is that because maybe
she, uh... Reminded you
of someone?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.298
-No.
-Okay.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.439
Riles?

19:01.441 --> 19:02.640
Yeah?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.408
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.011
I don't know yet.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.479
Is that okay?

19:08.481 --> 19:09.614
Yeah.

19:15.421 --> 19:17.054
Am i supposed
to ask you now?

19:17.056 --> 19:19.824
That would certainly
keep this going, so...

19:21.528 --> 19:22.760
-Maya?
-Yes!

19:23.897 --> 19:26.430
Do you have
any idea what you want
to be when you grow up?

19:26.432 --> 19:27.732
No.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.536
But being a teacher
might be cooler
than i thought.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.337
You know what else
is cool?

19:33.339 --> 19:37.041
Uncle jon used to take
care of shawn when he
was younger,

19:37.043 --> 19:38.809
You don't say.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.295
I do say.

19:41.296 --> 19:43.780
And my dad said
that they were really
good for each other.

19:48.621 --> 19:51.756
Okay, riley,
i finished this  <i> archie</i>
comic you gave me.

19:51.758 --> 19:56.427
I wanted to start him
on the road to good books.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.429
What'd you learn
from it, augs?

19:58.430 --> 20:00.430
Well... This dark-haired girl
and this blonde girl

20:00.433 --> 20:02.700
Both like the same boy
and they all stay
best friends.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.135
Could that
really happen?

20:04.137 --> 20:05.670
-No.
-Okay.

20:10.710 --> 20:11.976
Good morning.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.111
Before we begin today,

20:14.113 --> 20:16.547
A decision
has been reached.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.982
Now, i know you're all
going to remain
quiet and calm.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.651
Both:
We love her!

20:24.857 --> 20:27.141
Thank you.

20:27.142 --> 20:29.426
We appreciate it
when students are
fond of a teacher.

20:29.429 --> 20:33.464
I mean, it factors into
a decision, but it cannot
be the first priority.

20:33.466 --> 20:34.765
Uh-oh.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.068
That has to be

20:37.070 --> 20:41.072
Preparation that a teacher
puts into a lesson plan,

20:41.074 --> 20:42.940
And what the students
take from it.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.542
Cory, what are you
teaching today?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.844
I don't know.
I'm probably
making something up.

20:49.449 --> 20:52.416
All right, now ms. Burgess
went against school policy.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.553
The principal decided
what he saw fit.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.156
Right and wrong
can be difficult
to identify sometimes.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.092
That's what you just read
in english class.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.627
But this is history.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.762
And what does history
teach us. You?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.864
When it's a struggle
between right and wrong,

21:06.866 --> 21:09.166
That's when the real hero
fights hardest.

21:10.570 --> 21:12.136
So...

21:12.138 --> 21:14.639
For the greater good
of this school,

21:14.641 --> 21:17.074
It has been decided

21:17.076 --> 21:19.510
That someone had to go.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.948
So i would like
to introduce you to
your new english teacher.

21:23.950 --> 21:24.982
No!

21:24.984 --> 21:27.018
Why is it worth
learning anything

21:27.020 --> 21:29.804
If we can't change
the world for the better?

21:29.805 --> 21:32.589
How are we supposed to be heroes
if we can't do anything
about anything?

21:32.592 --> 21:33.924
Hi!

21:33.926 --> 21:35.926
(all cheering)

21:38.164 --> 21:39.530
Wow!

21:39.532 --> 21:41.599
Sometimes you can
beat superman.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.034
Very good, maya.

21:43.036 --> 21:44.468
You get an a.

21:44.470 --> 21:47.004
This new teacher's out
to ruin my reputation.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.479
He was one of
your teachers, mommy?

21:55.481 --> 21:58.215
Yeah, mr. Turner helped
me learn everything i know.

21:58.217 --> 21:59.817
She knows everything.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.252
I know.

22:01.254 --> 22:03.120
Was my daddy
a good student?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.655
He was a wonderful student.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.257
Why would you lie
to my kid?

22:08.795 --> 22:10.194
He tried his best.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.629
Why would you lie
to my kid?

22:11.631 --> 22:16.567
He was so bad, he became
a teacher so he could
go back to school again.

22:19.605 --> 22:23.007
So... Word has it
you took care
of shawn hunter?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.608
Yeah, i did.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.977
His dad was a little
off and on.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.512
No kid should have that.

22:28.514 --> 22:29.547
Yeah.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.615
Did you care
about him, though?

22:31.617 --> 22:33.084
You weren't his real father.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.552
No, i wasn't.

22:34.554 --> 22:36.787
But was it possible
for you to--

22:36.789 --> 22:38.522
Yes, maya.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.890
I loved him
like a son.

22:41.761 --> 22:43.094
I still do.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.830
That's good.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.232
Dad?

22:48.234 --> 22:49.266
Yeah?

22:49.268 --> 22:50.668
Thank you for being
a good teacher.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.203
Yeah, thanks.

22:53.639 --> 22:54.789
Boy, there's nothing better

22:54.790 --> 22:55.940
Than hearing that
from your students.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.011
Mr. Turner.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.980
Thank you for being
a good teacher.

23:02.982 --> 23:04.882
Yeah, thanks.

23:07.587 --> 23:09.887
You gave me
an a-minus once.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.088
Topanga.

23:12.125 --> 23:14.225
-Topanga.
-I want you to change it.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.094
Okay.
