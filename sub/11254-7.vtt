This is a good idea.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.629
{\an3}You don't want to miss out
on the next Facebook.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.549
- Oh. Good news.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.134
I've got a window
at 4:00 tomorrow.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.635
Your place?
- No.

07:49.719 --> 07:53.472
{\an1}- Well, I could push it to 4:10,
but then it gets dicey.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.892
{\an3}- Alicia,
I'm not a piece of meat.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.643
{\an3}Are you even interested in me
as a person?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.104
{\an3}I mean, you never ask me
anything about myself.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.230
- Okay, fine.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.357
What's your favorite color?

08:03.441 --> 08:04.483
{\an3}- Oh, blue.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.736
{\an1}- Oh, mine too.
This was meant to be.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.696
Tomorrow at 4:00.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.531
- Well, wait a minute, now!

08:10.615 --> 08:12.909
- Ooh.
Table beer.

08:12.992 --> 08:17.622
- Oh, there's a whole
energy right here.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.082
{\an3}- Mm-hmm.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
- All right, everybody!

08:21.667 --> 08:23.878
Boyce's commercial airs
in 15 minutes.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.463
- Oh, I'm so excited!

08:25.546 --> 08:27.006
{\an3}Oh, um, Lolli,
so how long

08:27.089 --> 08:31.260
have Stamps and the white girl
been, um, dating?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.054
- Stamps and Alicia?

08:34.138 --> 08:35.181
Ha!

08:35.264 --> 08:37.140
[together]
Ha!

08:37.225 --> 08:38.683
{\an3}- No, no, no, no.
Don't laugh.

08:38.768 --> 08:39.809
Robyn is very astute

08:39.894 --> 08:41.354
{\an3}at picking up
on social cues.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.980
- [gulps]
- Is she now?

08:43.063 --> 08:45.024
Uh, b-babe, you ain't gonna
believe this.

08:45.107 --> 08:49.862
Robyn thinks that this one
and this one are smashin'.

08:51.155 --> 08:52.949
{\an1}- Haha! Come on, now.
That's ridiculous.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.450
- Yeah. Ridiculous.
- Pfft.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.993
{\an3}- Yeah, I just call 'em
like I see 'em.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.119
- Nothing gets past her.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.038
{\an3}That's why
I couldn't cheat.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.707
{\an3}Not that I would,
because I wouldn't,

09:01.791 --> 09:05.461
{\an3}but if I wanted to,
which I don't, I couldn't.

09:05.544 --> 09:07.296
[clears throat]

09:07.380 --> 09:08.965
Love you, dumpling.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.466
- Love you more.

09:10.549 --> 09:13.052
{\an1}- Well, you know,
I hate to question someone

09:13.135 --> 09:16.973
{\an1}who's "never wrong,"
but you're wrong.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.891
- Way wrong.
- Couldn't be wronger.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.726
{\an1}- Okay, they're right.
It's true.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.770
- No--what the hell? No!
- Say what now?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.897
- When I say, "Always,"
you say, "Right"!

09:24.981 --> 09:25.856
Always!
- Right!

09:25.940 --> 09:27.149
- Always!
- Right!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.651
{\an3}When I say, "Never,"
you say, "Wrong"!

09:28.734 --> 09:29.652
Never!
- Wrong!

09:29.735 --> 09:30.861
- Never!
- Wrong!

09:32.697 --> 09:33.572
- Oh, my goodness.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.033
So you and you are...

09:36.117 --> 09:38.786
- Smashing!

09:38.869 --> 09:39.996
- Behind my back.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.080
- Why did you tell them?

09:41.163 --> 09:42.456
- Stamps, be realistic.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.750
{\an3}It was only a matter of time
before this got out,

09:44.834 --> 09:46.335
and I don't want
to lie to Boyce.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.047
- Oh, how noble of you.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.465
- I can't believe this.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.717
- I have needs, Boyce.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.218
I've been working
very long hours,

09:54.302 --> 09:56.095
and Stamps
is very attractive.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.680
He's in incredible shape.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.973
{\an1}I mean,
have you seen his abs?

09:59.056 --> 10:00.850
{\an3}They're like speed bumps,
just ba-ba--

10:00.933 --> 10:02.226
- La-la-la!
- Okay, all right. Okay.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.312
That's enough.
That's plenty.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.897
- He is beautiful.

10:08.941 --> 10:10.943
{\an1}- The bottom line is,
it was just sex--

10:11.027 --> 10:12.570
very quick and to the point.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.821
- She's not kidding.

10:13.904 --> 10:15.531
I mean, if anything,
I'm the victim here.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.615
I'm the one that got hurt.

10:16.699 --> 10:17.867
{\an3}- Oh, it was
a little hot wax.

10:17.950 --> 10:19.452
{\an3}Boo-hoo.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.996
{\an3}Can't we just please
get past the fact

10:22.079 --> 10:24.123
{\an3}that I slept with Stamps
a couple of times?

10:24.206 --> 10:25.249
- It was 11.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.543
I'm a person!

10:27.626 --> 10:28.836
- Oh, my God!

10:28.919 --> 10:29.962
This is supposed to be

10:30.046 --> 10:32.048
{\an1}a relaxing evening
for my husband.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.466
- I mean, really, Alicia,

10:33.549 --> 10:35.384
{\an3}you come and tell me
I'm down in the polls,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.595
and here you are,
down on Stamp's--

10:37.678 --> 10:39.180
- Baby!

10:39.263 --> 10:41.057
- Okay!

10:42.183 --> 10:43.434
Daddy, what did you do?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.853
{\an1}- Just checking on the score
of the Cardinals game.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.146
- You can't change
the channel.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.397
My commercial's
about to come on.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.690
- Well, I can't turn away!

10:49.774 --> 10:51.484
Wainwright's working on
a no-hitter.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.569
- It's the second inning, Dad!

10:53.652 --> 10:54.779
Turn it back.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.155
{\an1}- All right.
All right.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.990
What's got you so worked up?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.408
{\an3}- Ah...
[mutters]

10:59.492 --> 11:02.161
Just found out something
about Stamps and Alicia.

11:02.244 --> 11:05.039
- That they're getting it on?

11:05.122 --> 11:06.415
{\an3}- You knew?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.000
Why didn't you say anything?

11:08.084 --> 11:10.586
{\an1}- I stay out
of grown folks' business.

11:10.669 --> 11:12.797
{\an3}- You know what? My campaign
has got enough problems.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.964
I don't need this.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.466
- Well, careful, Boyce.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.259
{\an1}If you stand in the way
of their romance,

11:17.343 --> 11:19.678
{\an1}you risk pushing them
closer together.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.847
{\an1}Toula's father
found that out the hard way

11:21.931 --> 11:24.683
in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding."

11:24.767 --> 11:27.978
{\an3}- Thank you, Dad.
Big help.

11:28.062 --> 11:31.023
{\an3}- Hey, I just wanted
to make sure we're cool.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.274
- Cool?

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
You know, I don't think cool

11:34.276 --> 11:36.404
is how I feel right now.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.823
{\an3}- Look, I'm sorry
if you felt I disrespected you,

11:38.906 --> 11:42.243
{\an3}but I spend
17 working hours a day,

11:42.326 --> 11:44.453
{\an3}every day,
thinking about this campaign.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.039
{\an3}For one hour a day,
I have me time.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.541
Sometimes I take a hot bath,

11:48.624 --> 11:50.167
sometimes I eat a brownie,

11:50.251 --> 11:52.086
{\an3}and sometimes,
on low-carb days,

11:52.169 --> 11:54.130
I booty-call your brother.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.507
- If you'd let me watch
the Cardinals game,

11:56.590 --> 11:59.677
I wouldn't have
to listen to this.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.680
{\an1}- Alicia, I am
in this campaign to win it.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.516
{\an1}Now, I need to know
that you're giving me 100%.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.643
And even if 1% of that

12:07.726 --> 12:11.981
{\an1}is slowed down by
my brother's speed bumps,

12:12.064 --> 12:13.315
then we have a problem.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.735
{\an3}- I am in this 100%,
and if I have to kill Stamps

12:16.819 --> 12:20.322
{\an3}to get you elected,
I will do it.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.074
{\an1}- Good.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.452
{\an1}You know, you can
be terrifying sometimes.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.245
- All right, everybody.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.165
{\an3}T minus two minutes
until Boyce's commercial.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.500
- Ah, look at you two!

12:31.584 --> 12:32.793
Made up already, huh?

12:32.877 --> 12:33.961
- Yeah, I knew you would.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.421
I sensed it.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.174
- Of course you did.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.176
{\an3}Should've known
you were a freak.

12:40.259 --> 12:44.096
{\an3}It's always
the uptight ones.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.681
- You know,
I got to say,

12:45.764 --> 12:47.766
I think it's pretty chill
that you guys were able

12:47.850 --> 12:50.561
to move past
your snafu from earlier.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.854
- Well, it's behind us, so...

12:51.937 --> 12:53.230
- Well, I'm just saying,

12:53.314 --> 12:56.192
{\an3}if I hired a superhot manager
for our store

12:56.275 --> 12:58.027
{\an3}and she started sleeping
with my brother--

12:58.110 --> 12:59.361
- Hold up a minute, honey.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.614
{\an3}Who's this trollop
you're hiring?

13:01.697 --> 13:03.657
- Robyn, it's just
a "for instance."

13:03.741 --> 13:06.035
- Oh, oh, okay. So it's not
a "Darlene from the bank"?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.746
- Anyway, we're past it, guys.
- Oh, come on, Paul.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.498
{\an1}Nobody goes in the bank
anymore.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.208
I know your game.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.127
{\an3}- Oh, God forbid we hire
a little eye candy

13:15.211 --> 13:16.962
to draw people into the store.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.632
{\an1}- Oh!
So it <i> is</i> Darlene.

13:19.715 --> 13:23.344
{\an3}- She's very unhappy
at the bank!

13:23.427 --> 13:24.553
- Wait a minute. Wait.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.055
Can't we just put
a pin in this for now?

13:26.138 --> 13:28.849
{\an3}- You really think you got
a shot at Darlene?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.935
You're not cut like Stamps.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.603
- I really don't want
to be involved--

13:32.686 --> 13:34.063
- Take the compliment!

13:34.146 --> 13:36.106
{\an3}And there's no way
that hoochie Darlene

13:36.190 --> 13:37.358
is working in our store!

13:37.441 --> 13:39.193
{\an3}- Would you two
calm down?

13:39.276 --> 13:41.320
No one cares about
your stupid store!

13:41.403 --> 13:43.614
{\an1}- Stupid?

13:43.697 --> 13:44.907
{\an3}- Your father
doesn't think it's stupid.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.075
He's investing in it.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.576
- What?
- What?

13:47.660 --> 13:48.827
- Dad, you can't do that!

13:48.911 --> 13:52.540
- I just really miss
video stores.

13:52.623 --> 13:54.500
- Dad, no one goes
to video stores anymore.

13:54.583 --> 13:55.876
They're obsolete.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.002
- That's what they said

13:57.086 --> 13:59.755
about Toula's travel agency.

13:59.838 --> 14:02.216
- Enough with
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding."

14:02.299 --> 14:05.344
- You should watch it.
You might learn something.

14:05.427 --> 14:08.347
- You know,
if I do, I'll stream it,

14:08.430 --> 14:10.683
{\an1}like everybody else does
in the world today.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.644
{\an1}- Why you got to be so negative
about our store, Boyce?

14:13.727 --> 14:15.938
- Because
it's a terrible idea.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.398
It's 30 years too late.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.191
I can't believe
you two are so clueless.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.442
- We're clueless?

14:20.526 --> 14:21.652
{\an1}You're the one
that didn't know

14:21.735 --> 14:22.945
{\an1}your campaign manager
and your brother

14:23.028 --> 14:24.530
{\an3}were bumping uglies
under your nose.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.574
- Okay, that was unnecessary.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.950
- Yeah, and we have
moved past it.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.618
- Oh, yeah?
Then why does it keep coming up?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.788
{\an3}- 'Cause y'all keep
bringing it up!

14:32.871 --> 14:36.041
- All I wanted was a nice, quiet
evening with my family.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.626
- Well, Boyce, we're--

14:37.710 --> 14:39.795
- Ba-ba-ba-ba.
Do not say that we are family.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.422
Because we are not family.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.716
{\an3}Not by blood.
Not by marriage.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.259
We're not even play cousins.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.719
{\an1}- [gasps]

14:46.802 --> 14:49.471
{\an1}Well, if you hate us so much,
why did you invite us?

14:49.555 --> 14:51.056
both: We didn't!

14:51.140 --> 14:52.308
- Okay.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.101
{\an1}We know when
we're not welcome.

14:54.184 --> 14:56.854
{\an3}- Really?
Did you sense it?

14:56.937 --> 14:59.648
{\an1}- Okay.
You just lost our vote.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.150
- Oh, great.
- Good-bye.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.527
{\an3}We're gonna go put all those
Saxby signs back up.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.821
{\an1}- Yeah, because we are
Saxby people now.

15:05.904 --> 15:08.907
- Mm-hmm.
- Good. Go to his house.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.119
- ♪ Saxby the Choice ♪

15:12.202 --> 15:14.997
- What he said!

15:15.080 --> 15:16.665
- Don't--don't take my sign!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.626
{\an3}- Hey, guys!
Guys, it's on! It's on!

15:18.709 --> 15:19.585
{\an1}- Ooh!

15:19.668 --> 15:20.836
<i>- I'm Boyce Ballentine,</i>

15:20.919 --> 15:22.004
<i>and I approve this message.</i>

15:22.087 --> 15:23.339
[all sighing and groaning]

15:23.422 --> 15:25.633
- Whoa, whoa.
Did we just miss my commercial?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.218
{\an3}- Well, the last two seconds
were great.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.304
- Let's watch
the ball game, then.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.142
- Bro, I'm really sorry

15:35.225 --> 15:36.852
{\an3}about the whole mess
with Alicia.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.020
{\an3}I mean, I tried to break it off
with her for, like, a week,

15:38.103 --> 15:40.856
{\an3}but, man, she wants
what she wants.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.358
- Oh, I know.

15:42.441 --> 15:43.942
She's a piece of work.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.486
- Trying to tell her "no"

15:45.569 --> 15:47.613
is like being on the phone
with a credit card company.

15:47.696 --> 15:48.739
You keep saying,

15:48.822 --> 15:50.991
"Representative,
representative."

15:51.075 --> 15:52.034
But the machine
just ignores you

15:52.117 --> 15:55.788
{\an3}and makes you
keep having sex with it.

15:55.871 --> 15:59.208
- I was with you right up
until the end there, uh...

15:59.291 --> 16:01.168
- Ah!
There he is.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.711
The "milkman."

16:03.796 --> 16:05.631
- Uh, not anymore, Lolli.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.676
Today is the day I'm gonna go
to Alicia and end it.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.094
- Good for you, Stamps.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.387
{\an3}I mean,
you saying no

16:11.470 --> 16:14.264
{\an3}to unlimited sex
with no strings attached--

16:14.348 --> 16:15.391
I'm impressed.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.351
{\an1}- I know.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.144
{\an1}I don't know
who I am anymore.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.148
{\an3}- Babe, even though
last night

16:23.232 --> 16:25.275
{\an3}was not
the relaxing evening

16:25.359 --> 16:27.736
{\an3}we planned for,
the plus side is,

16:27.820 --> 16:30.906
{\an3}we got Paul and Robyn
out of our lives.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.366
- And you know what?

16:32.449 --> 16:34.868
{\an1}Even if I lose to Saxby
by two votes,

16:34.952 --> 16:36.912
it's totally worth it.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.372
{\an3}- Ha!
You know that's right.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.416
{\an1}- And I bet you, if we checked
our phones right now,

16:40.499 --> 16:41.542
{\an1}we'd have ten messages
from them.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.377
{\an3}- Oh, yeah.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.878
"It's Paul and Robyn,

16:44.962 --> 16:47.965
your neighbors from Vegas."

16:48.048 --> 16:49.842
- "We can't stay mad at you."

16:49.925 --> 16:51.719
both: "Shut up!"

16:52.886 --> 16:53.971
{\an3}- Oh...

16:54.054 --> 16:56.098
{\an3}No, I don't have
any messages.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.767
You?
- I got one. Let's see here.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.519
No, it's nothing.

17:00.602 --> 17:03.856
{\an1}Just another robocall
from Saxby.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.776
{\an3}- Hmm...
How do you feel?

17:07.859 --> 17:09.611
- I don't know.
How do you feel?

17:09.694 --> 17:12.614
{\an3}- [scoffs]
I feel good!

17:12.698 --> 17:15.325
I feel terrible.

17:15.409 --> 17:19.663
{\an3}I feel like I just kicked
a puppy into another puppy.

17:20.622 --> 17:24.001
{\an1}- Me too.
I mean, I don't get it.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.627
{\an1}It's what we wanted
for years.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.713
No more Paul and Robyn.

17:27.796 --> 17:29.131
So why do we feel so bad?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.175
- I don't know!

17:31.258 --> 17:32.593
- Well, you know what?

17:32.676 --> 17:34.887
What's done is done.
We can't dwell on it.

17:34.970 --> 17:38.140
{\an1}Might as well just kick back
and enjoy the quiet.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.350
{\an3}- Agreed.

17:40.434 --> 17:43.228
{\an3}[sighs]

17:43.312 --> 17:45.355
both: Damn it!

17:49.902 --> 17:51.820
- Look, Alicia,
we need to talk.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.448
{\an1}- Oh, Stamps, hey.
We're over.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.742
{\an3}- I-I'm sorry.
What?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.119
{\an1}- Us hooking up--
it's run its course,

17:59.203 --> 18:00.662
{\an1}and now it's getting
in the way,

18:00.746 --> 18:02.039
so moving on.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.083
{\an3}- No!
No, no, no. No.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.294
{\an3}Now, I was gonna
break up with you, man!

18:07.377 --> 18:09.129
{\an1}- Oh.
Good!

18:09.213 --> 18:10.339
{\an3}No.
No, no, no!

18:10.422 --> 18:12.049
{\an3}It's not good!
Okay?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.259
{\an3}You've been in control of this
every step of the way.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.427
At least let me have this.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.887
{\an1}- Okay, fine.
Proceed.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.264
- Thank you.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.433
{\an3}[huffs]
Look, Alicia, you know,

18:21.517 --> 18:23.352
{\an3}we have had
a really good time,

18:23.435 --> 18:25.020
{\an3}and you're a sweet girl,
but...

18:25.103 --> 18:26.146
[cell phone ringing]

18:26.230 --> 18:27.564
It's best that I move--
- Ooh!

18:27.648 --> 18:29.066
I've been waiting
for this reporter

18:29.149 --> 18:30.609
to get back to me all day.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.820
- You've got to be kidding me.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.363
{\an1}- Can we just
put a pin in this

18:34.446 --> 18:35.739
and then wrap it up later?

18:35.823 --> 18:36.698
{\an1}Great!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.992
Bob. Oh, hey.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.911
{\an1}Oh, no,
this is a perfect time.

18:40.994 --> 18:43.288
{\an1}Uh-huh.
That's right!

18:45.207 --> 18:48.252
- She's hurting on the inside.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.129
- Bob, you crazy bastard.
I love it!

18:54.132 --> 18:55.717
- Do we need Spanish onions?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.553
- I don't know.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.346
Get a couple to be safe.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.307
- How are we on pluots?
- I don't know.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.893
- Oh!
- [gasps]

19:04.977 --> 19:08.397
- No, shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up!

19:08.480 --> 19:09.439
- It's Boyce and Lolli,

19:09.523 --> 19:10.440
your old neighbors

19:10.524 --> 19:11.608
when you lived in Vegas!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.735
{\an3}- Oh. Hey.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.904
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We know who you are.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.907
- It is so great
to see you guys!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.493
{\an1}- Hey, hope there's no hard
feelings about what happened.

19:21.577 --> 19:22.786
{\an1}- Whatever you say.
It's cool.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.204
{\an3}- Yeah.
We'll see you around.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.414
{\an3}- Yeah.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.165
- Well, guess we're
finished shopping.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.501
{\an3}- Hey, uh, what do you
have in there?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.628
Pretzel sticks, peanuts,
and Rice Chex?

19:31.712 --> 19:36.425
- You, uh, putting together
a little--little party mix?

19:36.508 --> 19:37.801
- Yes, we are.

19:37.885 --> 19:38.927
- Yeah. Party.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.971
And I was thinking,

19:41.054 --> 19:42.431
if the two of you
are not busy--

19:42.514 --> 19:44.933
{\an3}- [shrieks]
- Of course we're coming!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.768
{\an3}- Can't stay mad
at our best friends!

19:46.852 --> 19:47.978
- All right!

19:48.061 --> 19:50.939
- We got the karaoke machine
in the Winnebago!

19:51.023 --> 19:52.858
- I'm not even surprised.
