00:11.594 --> 00:15.098
WORKING IN TEAMS
HAD THE ARTISTS BUTTING HEADS.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.975
- JUST LET ME KNOW
WHAT TO DO NEXT.

00:17.058 --> 00:19.227
- PLEASE DON'T [bleep]
THESE TENTACLES UP.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.687
- CRIS AND AARON ARE DOING THE
SAME EXACT THING WE'RE DOING.

00:20.770 --> 00:21.771
- WE'RE DOING ONE OF THOSE TOO.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.773
- MOTHER[bleep], DUDE.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.859
THEY'RE DOING A DNA HELIX
AND TENTACLES.

00:25.942 --> 00:27.861
- JUST AS EXPECTED,
THESE GUYS CANNOT CREATE ART.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.864
announcer: IN THE ELIMINATION
TATTOO, THE ARTISTS WENT

00:30.947 --> 00:34.659
HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE ULTIMATE
TEST OF PRECISION.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.786
- I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I DID A PORTRAIT.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.913
- I'M READY TO WATCH EVERYBODY
ELSE FALL DOWN AND ME TO RISE.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.790
THIS MAY BE ONE OF MY BEST WINS.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.792
I'LL PUT MONEY ON THE FACT

00:42.876 --> 00:44.919
THAT I JUST BEAT
YOU HEAD TO HEAD AGAIN.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.671
- DING, DING, DING! IT'S ON.
- OH, IT'S OVER ALREADY.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.548
- OH.
- OH.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.675
- I FEEL A LOT
OF [bleep] PRESSURE RIGHT NOW.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.427
- I'LL BE [bleep] LIVID
IF I GO HOME BEFORE YOU GUYS.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.678
- DON'T [bleep] WITH ME,
ALL RIGHT?

00:53.762 --> 00:55.805
- MIND YOUR ANXIETY,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.640
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T NO WAY
YOU'RE GOING TO THE FINALE

AARON, CRIS,

01:00.894 --> 01:02.937
AND ERIK WERE THE BOTTOM THREE.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.899
- CRIS, THESE MADE-UP CONSTANTLY
CHANGED THOSE CONTOURS.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.609
YOU DID PUT A FEW YEARS ON HER.

01:07.692 --> 01:09.319
- I'M JUST DISAPPOINTED
IN MYSELF

01:09.402 --> 01:10.945
JUST BEING DOWN HERE
SO MANY TIMES.

01:11.196 --> 01:12.906
- WHEN YOU HAVE
THAT MANY POOR OUTINGS,

01:12.989 --> 01:14.949
YOU NEED TO CATCH UP.
- AARON--

01:15.033 --> 01:15.950
- I DON'T FEEL
THIS IS A VERY PRECISE TATTOO.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.911
IT LOOKS RUSHED.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.913
- IT WAS METICULOUS AND TEDIOUS,
AND I TOOK A LOT OF TIME.

01:19.996 --> 01:21.664
{\an8}- BUT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT LOOKS METICULOUS.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.833
{\an8}AS FAR AS CAPTURING THE LIKENESS
OF THIS YOUNG GIRL,

01:23.917 --> 01:26.294
{\an8}Y'ALL BOTH MISSED THE MARK.
- ERIK--

01:26.377 --> 01:28.838
- YOU ALTERED DETAILS
WHICH CHANGED THE SHAPE

01:28.922 --> 01:30.256
OF THIS LADY'S FACE.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.217
- THE PEOPLE STANDING NEXT TO ME

01:32.300 --> 01:33.468
HAVE BEEN AT THE BOTTOM
SO MANY DAMNED TIMES.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.428
I HAVE ONE BAD DAY.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.388
I BASICALLY DON'T THINK
I DESERVE TO GO HOME.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.475
- YOUR REPORT CARD
CAN ONLY SAVE YOU SO MUCH.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.185
- AARON, YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE <i> INK MASTER.</i>

01:47.565 --> 01:49.734

{\an8}THERE'S ONLY FIVE ARTISTS
LEFT IN THIS COMPETITION

06:13.039 --> 06:14.874
{\an8}AND I WANT TO BE BLOWN

06:14.957 --> 06:16.125
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.127
- THESE GUYS HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY

06:18.211 --> 06:19.587
KNOW EVERY ASPECT
OF THEIR TATTOO.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.339
- WOW.

- NIKKO.

06:31.974 --> 06:35.228
- NIKKO HURTADO.

TATTOOS.

06:38.147 --> 06:40.149
{\an8}TODAY, I'M REALLY LOOKING
FOR THESE ARTISTS

06:40.233 --> 06:43.528
{\an8}TO GIVE THEIR CANVASES
THE BEST THEY HAVE.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.321
THEY SHOULD BE THE CREAM
OF THE CROP,

06:45.571 --> 06:47.281
SO IF I DON'T SEE
SOME CREATIVE WORK TODAY,

06:47.365 --> 06:48.574
I'M GONNA
BE PRETTY DISAPPOINTED.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.368
- HELL YEAH, DUDE.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.286
- THESE JUDGES
ARE SOME HEAVY HITTERS.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.996
{\an8}I GOT TO MAKE SURE
MY TATTOO IS ON POINT,

06:54.080 --> 06:57.166
{\an8}'CAUSE WE ARE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH NOTHING.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.085
THIS IS A GAME CHANGER.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.421
- IN EVERY ELIMINATION TATTOO,
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE TATTOOING

07:02.505 --> 07:05.341
HEAD TO HEAD WITH AT LEAST ONE
OTHER ARTIST.

07:05.424 --> 07:09.804

THE SAME SUBJECT...

- A GRIM REAPER.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.893
- [bleep]

07:15.977 --> 07:19.230
- THE PERSONIFICATION OF DEATH
EXISTS IN ALMOST EVERY CULTURE,

07:19.480 --> 07:21.899
BUT THE MOST
COMMON IS THE GRIM REAPER.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.734
DEPICTED WITH A CLOAK, HOOD,

07:23.818 --> 07:26.112
AND SCYTHE FOR REAPING SOULS,

07:26.195 --> 07:29.198
THIS IMAGE OF DEATH HAS BEEN
AROUND SINCE THE 15th CENTURY.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.285
- GRIM REAPER'S A SUPER
CLASSIC TATTOO DESIGN.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.121
IF YOU CAN'T TATTOO A GRIM
REAPER THIS LATE IN THE GAME,

07:35.204 --> 07:36.914
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.916
- EACH GUEST JUDGE
HAS PICKED A SKILL

07:39.000 --> 07:41.419
THAT THEY WILL BE
JUDGING YOUR TATTOO ON.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.337
- WHAT?
- OH, MAN.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.214
- I'LL BE JUDGING YOU GUYS
ON CREATIVITY.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.300
GRIM REAPER'S BEEN
DONE A MILLION TIMES,

07:47.383 --> 07:49.343
SO I'LL SEE
HOW YOU GUYS DO IT DIFFERENTLY.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.137
- I'LL BE JUDGING YOU GUYS
ON HOW YOU USE CONTRAST

07:51.220 --> 07:53.347
TO SEPARATE EACH ELEMENT
OF THE DESIGN.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.224
- I'LL BE JUDGING COMPOSITION.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.852
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT THE TATTOOS FIT THE CONTOUR

07:57.935 --> 07:59.228
OF THE BODY AND FLOW NATURALLY.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.147
- THE JUDGES ARE GONNA

08:01.230 --> 08:02.398
SCRUTINIZE EVERY LITTLE DETAIL
WE DO.

08:02.481 --> 08:06.235
{\an8}NOW, THE GAME IS REALLY ON.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.029
- THIS IS GETTING TIGHT.
- YEAH.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.072
- THIS IS IT.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.449
- WE'VE GOT SIX PEOPLE
BEATING YOUR TATTOO UP NOW.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.659
- OH, MAN.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.785
- SO EVERY LITTLE BIT YOU DO
IS GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.787
- OH, MY GOD.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.873
- THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR ERROR AT ALL.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.416
- THIS TATTOO'S GONNA
BE THE DEATH OF ONE OF YOU.

08:20.499 --> 08:22.168
- NO PRESSURE.
- OH, BOY.

08:22.251 --> 08:26.923
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.799
SINCE THERE IS NO FLASH
CHALLENGE,

08:28.883 --> 08:32.385
I WILL BE ASSIGNING
THE HUMAN CANVASSES.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.846
- OH, NO.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.181
{\an8}- BECAUSE I AM A HUMAN CANVAS
MYSELF,

08:35.264 --> 08:37.015
{\an8}I'M HOPING TO GIVE EVERYBODY

08:37.099 --> 08:39.769
{\an8}THE BEST ARTIST
SUITED FOR WHAT THEY WANT.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.437
WHAT'S THE LONGEST YOU SAT FOR?
- EIGHT HOURS.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.980
- EIGHT HOURS?
OKAY, GOOD.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.815
{\an8}- I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW DAVE THINKS,

08:44.899 --> 08:47.485
{\an8}SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE'S
GONNA HAND THESE SKULLS OUT.

08:47.568 --> 08:49.278
- I'D LIKE A GRIM REAPER
ON MY BACK.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.405
- COLOR ON MY UPPER ARM.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.324
- BLUE AND PURPLE
WOULD BE MY IDEAL COLORS.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.159
{\an8}- IT'S GONNA BE HARD
TO MAKE A GRIM REAPER DARK

08:55.243 --> 08:57.411
{\an8}AND EVIL DOING IT IN COLOR.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.330
{\an8}THAT'S A ROUGH ONE.

08:59.413 --> 09:01.540
- A SCARY GRIM REAPER
SITTING ON A THRONE OF SKULLS.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.000
- A THRONE OF SKULLS?
- YEAH.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.335
- MAN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:04.585 --> 09:05.836
{\an8}THAT IS A LOT
TO SHOVE INTO SIX HOURS.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.425
JUST GIVE ME A SIMPLE GRIM
REAPER AND LET ME DO MY THING.

09:11.509 --> 09:15.263
- BACK, ARM, ARM, BACK, ARM.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.433
{\an8}- WE STARTED WITH 18 ARTISTS,

09:19.517 --> 09:21.936
{\an8}AND NOW WE'RE DOWN TO FIVE.
HERE YOU GO.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.230
EVERY ONE OF THESE TATTOOS
SHOULD BE BULLETPROOF.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.444
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

09:30.528 --> 09:32.863
PLEASE READ THE ARTIST'S NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.032
- CRIS?

09:35.116 --> 09:36.033
- JASON?

09:40.579 --> 09:42.331
- ERIK.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.374
{\an8}- DAVE DEFINITELY GAVE ME
THE HARDEST CANVAS.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.709
{\an8}I'M FEELING THE PRESSURE.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.877
- CLEEN ROCK ONE.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.587
- MARK?
- YES, HI.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.839
GRIM REAPER IN COLOR
ON THE ARM--

09:49.922 --> 09:51.465
{\an8}I'M FEELING SUPER CONFIDENT.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.509
{\an8}I'M READY TO WIN
THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.428
- THIS WEEK, THERE WILL BE
NO HUMAN CANVAS JURY.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.557
ALL DECISIONS ARE COMPLETELY
UP TO THE PANEL OF JUDGES.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.393
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A GRIM REAPER

10:02.476 --> 10:05.521
THAT WILL BE SCRUTINIZED
LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.440
GOOD LUCK.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.275
{\an8}- A GRIM REAPER IS DEFINITELY
ONE OF THOSE ICONIC IMAGES.

10:09.358 --> 10:12.403
{\an8}WE REALLY WANT TO SEE
THESE FINAL FIVE ARTISTS

10:12.486 --> 10:14.530
{\an8}BRING SOMETHING
SPECIAL TO THIS DESIGN...

10:14.613 --> 10:16.240
- YOU CAN HAVE A SEAT RIGHT
THERE.

10:16.324 --> 10:17.950
- AND REALLY SHOW
THAT THEY CAN PULL OFF CONTRAST,

10:18.034 --> 10:20.036
COMPOSITION, AND CREATIVITY.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.288
- SO HE GAVE ME YOU
BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF COLOR.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.248
- PERFECT.
- YOU WANT TO PUT THE SICKLE--

10:24.332 --> 10:26.042
- I'D PREFER IT BE IN. YEAH.
- OKAY, COOL.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.169
- YEAH.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER TATTOOS?

10:28.252 --> 10:30.046
- YEAH, I HAVE MY BACK, MY RIBS,
AND MY LOWER STOMACH.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.922
- WE EXPECT TO SEE
THE BEST OF THE BEST.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.799
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS GONNA BE A BIG TATTOO.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.009
{\an8}- THERE'S NO WAY I'M DOING
A THRONE OF SKULLS TODAY, 'CAUSE

10:35.092 --> 10:37.011
{\an8}IT'S JUST NOT GONNA WORK.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.471
IF YOU WANT A GRIM REAPER
SITTING IN A THRONE,

10:38.554 --> 10:40.431
THE HEAD'S GONNA BE SUPER SMALL.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.849
THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH SURFACE
AREA ON HIS ARM

10:41.932 --> 10:43.267
TO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.353
IT'D JUST BE A [bleep] SHOW.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.979
I HAVE TO TALK MY CANVAS
OUT OF IT, BECAUSE IF NOT,

10:47.063 --> 10:48.939
I'M DEFINITELY SCREWED.
- YEAH.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.191
- MAYBE WE COULD DO, LIKE,
HIM WEARING, LIKE,

10:50.274 --> 10:52.234
A NECKLACE OF SKULLS

10:52.318 --> 10:53.819
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.322
{\an8}MY CANVAS WANTS
THIS TATTOO RIGHT ON HER BACK.

10:56.405 --> 10:59.116
- WHERE ARE WE PUTTING IT AT?
- DEFINITELY ABOVE THAT.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.910
- BUT SHE HAS OTHER TATTOOS
THERE.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.162
YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT ANYTHING
UP HERE?

11:03.245 --> 11:04.997
- I HAVE ALREADY HAVE THOSE
THREE LETTERS, LIKE, COMING--

11:05.081 --> 11:06.791
- LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.209
SO I'M ALREADY SCREWED
ON COMPOSITION--

11:08.292 --> 11:10.002
BAM, RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.921
SO I JUST WANT TO PLACE IT
IN AN AREA

11:12.004 --> 11:13.798
WHERE IT'S GONNA LOOK
RIGHT ON YOUR BODY.

11:13.881 --> 11:15.007
SO I REALLY HAVE TO PULL
A BAD-ASS TATTOO

11:15.091 --> 11:18.803
OUT OF MY POCKET.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.596
- GONNA BE THE SCARY ONE.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.348
SKULL MASTER.

11:22.431 --> 11:26.435
IT'S A HARD ONE, MAN.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.604
GOT IT DRAWN UP YET?
- YEP.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.439
- THIS ONE'S GONNA BE FUN.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.233
I'M STOKED
ERIK GOT THE HARDEST SKULL.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.526
{\an8}I JUST BEAT HIM IN A HEAD
TO HEAD

11:33.609 --> 11:35.569
{\an8}AND I NEED TO BEAT HIM AGAIN.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
I KNOW I CAN KNOCK IT OUT
OF THE PARK WITH THIS DESIGN.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.572
- YOU'RE DOING YOURS COLOR
OR BLACK AND GRAY?

11:38.823 --> 11:41.951
- COLOR. PRETTY STOKED.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.661
- SO YOU'RE NOT SHOWING
THE FACE?

11:43.744 --> 11:44.620
- NO, HE WANTS IT
ALL GHOULISH.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.455
- YEAH.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.374
{\an8}MARK'S DONE ONE GOOD TATTOO
SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE,

11:48.457 --> 11:49.375
{\an8}AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE THINKS HE'S HOT [bleep]?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.085
- IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.503
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.598
- YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO TATTOO A GRIM REAPER,

12:04.849 --> 12:09.437
AND YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.605
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.
- SO GET THE SHIRT--

12:11.689 --> 12:12.982
- LET'S GET THIS DONE.
- ALL RIGHT, GIRL.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.359
- FOR THESE LAST FIVE TATTOOERS,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.611
WE SAVED THESE GUEST JUDGES
ALL THE WAY TILL THE END.

12:17.695 --> 12:20.698
{\an8}THIS IS IT. THESE GUYS
ARE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.533
THE STAKES ARE HIGH.

12:22.616 --> 12:23.742
- HERE WE GO.

12:29.832 --> 12:32.126
{\an8}- MY CANVAS ORIGINALLY
WANTED A COLORED GRIM REAPER

12:32.209 --> 12:34.211
{\an8}SITTING ON A THRONE OF SKULLS.

12:34.295 --> 12:37.173
WE'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO DOING
A PARTIAL GRIM REAPER.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.675
I JUST TOLD HIM IF HE'S GONNA
DO IT, IT'S GOT TO BE BIG.

12:39.758 --> 12:41.886
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO A HEAD
THE SIZE OF A QUARTER.

12:41.969 --> 12:43.554
- BECAUSE OF THE DETAIL
ON THE FACE?

12:43.637 --> 12:45.639
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.516
- I MEAN, HE'S A BIG GUY--DO
SOMETHING THAT'S A LOT BROADER.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.517
MAKE IT LOOK AS CREEPY
AS POSSIBLE.

12:48.767 --> 12:50.936
WITH ONLY FIVE PEOPLE LEFT,

12:51.020 --> 12:52.730
EVERY TATTOO I DO RIGHT NOW
HAS TO BE THE BEST OF MY CAREER.

12:52.813 --> 12:53.814
I THINK IT'S GONNA LOOK
PRETTY AWESOME.

12:53.898 --> 12:55.608
I'M STOKED.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.278
{\an8}- I LOVE TATTOOING GRIM REAPERS
AND I LOVE DRAWING GRIM REAPERS.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.031
I DEFINITELY WOULD GET
THIS ON MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.908
AS A KID GROWING UP,

13:03.991 --> 13:05.910
I WOULD DRAW IT NONSTOP
BECAUSE I WAS BORN

13:05.993 --> 13:07.536
WITH A RARE CONDITION
CALLED PECTUS EXCAVATUM.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.622
I HAD A SUNKEN-IN CHEST.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.624
IT WAS PRESSED AGAINST MY HEART
AND IT WAS REALLY HARD

13:11.707 --> 13:14.001
FOR ME TO BREATHE
AND DO REALLY ACTIVE THINGS.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.836
ART COMPLETELY TOOK OVER
MY LIFE.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
THIS SPOT HURT?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.923
- OH, YEAH.

13:19.006 --> 13:21.133
- I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT,
THEN I'M GONNA WIN.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.219
- THREE HOURS TO GO, EVERYBODY.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.311
{\an8}- MY STRATEGY WITH THIS TATTOO
IS TO DO A DIFFERENT STYLE

13:32.394 --> 13:34.772
{\an8}OF GRIM REAPER AND MAKE
IT STAND OUT FROM ALL THE REST.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.649
- WHAT'S UP, MARK?
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

13:36.732 --> 13:38.609
- GOOD.
- YOU'VE BEEN TATTOOING FOREVER.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.736
I REMEMBER SEEING YOUR NAME
AROUND WHEN I FIRST STARTED.

13:40.986 --> 13:42.780
- IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
IN THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.198
WE'VE GOT SIX JUDGES
AND WE'RE SO CLOSE.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.991
I CANNOT STUMBLE NOW.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.535
- ALL BLACK AND GRAY?

13:47.618 --> 13:49.578
- NO, THIS ONE'S GONNA
BE FULL COLOR.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.038
- MARK'S TATTOO--
COMPOSITIONALLY,

13:51.121 --> 13:52.331
IT'S VERY FORCED.

13:52.414 --> 13:53.707
{\an8}THE FACE OF THE GRIM REAPER--

13:53.791 --> 13:55.125
{\an8}IT'S SOLID BLACK.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.585
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A COVER UP.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.296
HE NEEDS TO STEP IT UP.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.714
- ONE HOUR LEFT.

14:10.266 --> 14:13.727
{\an8}- I'M SUPER WORRIED THAT I
WENT TOO BIG WITH THIS TATTOO.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.604
- HI, GUYS.
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.232
- GOOD, HOW ARE YOU?
- JAMMING, JAMMING, JAMMING.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.609
I MIGHT NOT FINISH.
IT WOULD SUCK SO BAD

14:20.693 --> 14:22.695
TO COME THIS FAR AND THEN
TO GO HOME.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.281
- I WAS GONNA DO
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

14:25.364 --> 14:28.951
AND DO, LIKE, THIS REAL HEAVY,
HEAVY DUTY LIGHT SOURCE,

14:29.034 --> 14:30.786
AND THEN TIME WAS JUST TICKING,
TICKING, TICKING,

14:30.869 --> 14:33.038
AND I JUST STARTED
RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.332
- CLEEN'S TATTOO
WORRIES ME THE MOST.

14:35.416 --> 14:37.251
THERE'S NO CONTRAST
SHOWING RIGHT NOW.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.378
{\an8}THERE'S JUST A WHOLE LOT
OF LINE WORK.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.630
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO DO SOME MAGIC
TO MAKE THAT LOOK GOOD.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.881
- I'M LIKE,
FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.719
{\an8}- I WAS DOUBTING MYSELF.
- YEAH,

14:47.011 --> 14:49.179
{\an8}BUT A MASTER
WOULD NEVER DOUBT THEMSELF.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.307
- I CAN'T STAND THIS TATTOO.
- FROM THE LOOKS OF THIS TATTOO,

14:51.390 --> 14:51.807
YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU DO.
- THAT'S FIGHTING WORDS.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.406
- I'M FIGHTING WITH THE TIME
ON THIS ONE,

15:07.489 --> 15:11.285
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BIG TATTOO.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.662
IT'S GONNA BE A RACE
TO THE FINISH LINE.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.623
- OW.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.790
- STAKES ARE SO HIGH RIGHT NOW.

15:16.874 --> 15:18.584
THERE'S FIVE OF US LEFT.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.002
SO I'M GONNA MAKE THIS THE MOST
BAD-ASS GRIM REAPER

15:20.085 --> 15:21.795
YOU EVER DID SEE.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.547
RAD, I DON'T EVER GET
TO DO BLACK AND GRAY.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.716
SO YEAH,
I LIKE DOING STUFF LIKE THIS.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.052
- I'M BRINGING A LOT
OF CREATIVITY TO THIS DESIGN.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.763
I HAVE THE PERFECT CONTRAST,
THE PERFECT COMPOSITION--

15:30.846 --> 15:31.639
{\an8}I'MA WIN.

15:35.726 --> 15:36.810
- TEN...

15:36.894 --> 15:37.811
NINE...

15:37.895 --> 15:38.687
EIGHT...

15:38.771 --> 15:39.688
SEVEN...

15:39.772 --> 15:40.689
SIX...

15:40.773 --> 15:41.857
FIVE...

15:41.940 --> 15:42.983
FOUR...

15:43.067 --> 15:44.026
THREE...

15:44.109 --> 15:45.110
TWO...

15:45.194 --> 15:46.820
ONE.

15:46.904 --> 15:47.696
THAT'S IT.
TIME'S UP.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.864
MACHINES DOWN.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.824
NO MORE TATTOOING.

15:50.908 --> 15:53.827
- THAT'S IT.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.871
- TAKE A LOOK IN THE MIRROR.

15:55.954 --> 15:57.623
- OH, YEAH.

15:57.706 --> 15:58.707
THAT'S BAD-ASS.
I LIKE THAT.

15:58.791 --> 16:02.628
- IT'S [bleep] AWESOME.

16:02.711 --> 16:03.712
- OH, MY GOD.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.091
THAT IS AMAZING.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.093
- MARK'S DESIGN, TO ME,

16:09.176 --> 16:10.719
IT LOOKS LIKE A USED CONDOM
HOLDING A SICKLE.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.596
{\an8}IT'S SUB-PAR.
THE EXECUTION IS HORRIBLE.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.598
HE MISSED EVERY SINGLE MARK
THAT THE JUDGES WANTED TO SEE.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.601
- NO PROBLEM.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.520
- THERE'S ONLY FIVE OF US LEFT,
YOU KNOW?

16:19.603 --> 16:21.188
AND EVERYBODY'S DOING
PRETTY GOOD TATTOOS.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.232
- I FEEL CONFIDENT, MAN.
I MEAN,

16:23.315 --> 16:25.567
I DEFINITELY LET EVERYTHING GO
THAT I HAD BEFORE--

16:25.651 --> 16:27.569
WORRYING ABOUT EVERYTHING,

16:27.653 --> 16:29.196
AND I FEEL LIKE I'M DOING
BETTER TATTOOS NOW.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.906
- MM.
- YOU DON'T THINK THAT?

16:30.989 --> 16:33.158
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I WOULD BE--

16:33.242 --> 16:34.868
- I'M NOT--I'M NOT--HONESTLY,
HOW COULD YOU BE CONSIDERED

16:34.952 --> 16:36.161
AN INK MASTER,
IF YOU'VE SKATED

16:36.245 --> 16:37.746
THROUGH THIS COMPETITION?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.832
- THAT'S FOR THE JUDGES
TO DECIDE.

16:40.124 --> 16:41.667
- I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU THROWN YOUR HANDS UP

16:41.750 --> 16:43.836
AND GIVEN UP?
"WHATEVER. I DON'T CARE.

16:43.919 --> 16:45.713
I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE."

16:45.796 --> 16:46.839
- I'VE NEVER SAID
I DON'T CARE.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.215
I'M STILL DOING AS BEST

16:48.298 --> 16:50.217
AS I POSSIBLY COULD TO BE HERE.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.344
- NOW THAT IT'S DOWN TO THE END,
YOU'RE FIGHTING.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.388
- BUT I'M FIGHTING WHEN IT
MEANS THE MOST RIGHT NOW.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.639
- YEAH, BUT YOU WEREN'T FIGHTING
AT THE BEGINNING.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.725
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:57.808 --> 16:59.768
THAT'S BECAUSE I WAS
DOUBTING MYSELF ALL THE TIME.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.687
- YEAH, BUT A MASTER
WOULD NEVER DOUBT THEMSELF.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.772
- EVERYBODY HERE HAS BEEN UPS
AND DOWNS TOO.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.648
THIS IS ALL SOME MENTAL
MIND [bleep], MAN. IT'S LIKE--

17:05.733 --> 17:06.942
- WELL YEAH,
BUT GOING INTO EVERY TATTOO,

17:07.025 --> 17:08.944
YOU SHOULD HAVE 100% CONFIDENCE.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.238
- I HAVE ENOUGH TALENT THAT I
SHOULD BE GOING TO THE FINALE,

17:11.320 --> 17:12.531
AND I HAVE THE POTENTIAL
TO DO A REALLY GOOD TATTOO.

17:12.614 --> 17:13.741
- BUT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN.

17:13.824 --> 17:13.866
THAT'S THE POINT.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.963
- TODAY, YOU ALL HAD
TO TATTOO A GRIM REAPER,

17:28.047 --> 17:29.798
AND YOU'RE BEING JUDGED

17:29.882 --> 17:31.550
ON THE SKILLS PICKED
BY OUR GUEST JUDGES:

17:31.633 --> 17:33.552
CREATIVITY, COMPOSITION,

17:33.635 --> 17:36.722
AND CONTRAST.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.349
- OBVIOUSLY, OUR PANEL OF JUDGES
TODAY IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

17:39.433 --> 17:42.060
YOUR TATTOOS ARE GONNA BE
SCRUTINIZED LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.812
IT'S GONNA GET PRETTY ROUGH
TODAY.

17:44.062 --> 17:46.690
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE IN YOUR SHOES RIGHT NOW.

17:46.774 --> 17:50.319
- MARK, LET'S START WITH YOU.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.738
HOW YOU FEELING
WITH THIS PANEL OF JUDGES

17:52.821 --> 17:54.865
HERE CRITIQUING YOUR WORK?

17:54.948 --> 17:56.241
- AS SOON AS I WALKED IN,
IT LOOKED TWICE AS INTENSE

17:56.325 --> 17:57.993
AS IT USUALLY DOES.

17:58.076 --> 17:59.328
- THE OVERALL FEEL
OF THIS TATTOO

17:59.411 --> 18:01.371
IS VERY BUBBLY AND CARTOONY.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.415
IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE, LIKE,
A DARK, EVIL SIDE.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.000
{\an8}- AS FAR AS THE CONTRAST,

18:05.083 --> 18:07.294
{\an8}THE BLACK FACE AND THE CLOAK--

18:07.377 --> 18:09.838
{\an8}YOU DEFINITELY COULD HAVE SHOWN
A LITTLE MORE DIMENSION,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.590
{\an8}ADDING A LITTLE SHADE
AS IF IT WAS EMPTY,

18:11.673 --> 18:13.425
{\an8}NOT JUST A SOLID BLACK BLOB.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.344
{\an8}- FROM A COMPOSITIONAL
STANDPOINT,

18:15.427 --> 18:17.554
{\an8}I THINK WE ALL AGREE
IT'S A BIT JUVENILE.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.224
IT LACKS THAT SERIOUS LOOK
THAT A GRIM REAPER SHOULD HAVE.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.934
IT'S NOT A TATTOO
DESIGNED FOR AN ADULT.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.019
YOU SHOULD LOVE WHAT YOU DO,

18:24.102 --> 18:25.896
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEN DON'T DO IT.

18:25.979 --> 18:26.897
AND FROM THE LOOKS
OF THIS TATTOO,

18:27.147 --> 18:28.524
YOU DON'T LOVE WHAT YOU DO.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.526
- THAT'S PRETTY ROUGH, 'CAUSE I

18:30.609 --> 18:31.985
LOVE TATTOOING MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.987
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE TO IT.

18:34.071 --> 18:34.822
- I DON'T GET THE FEELING
THAT YOU PUT ANY LOVE INTO IT,

18:34.905 --> 18:36.990
ANY EFFORT--

18:37.074 --> 18:37.783
AND YOU JUST DID
THE BARE MINIMUM.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.833
- CLEEN.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.877
- TECHNICALLY, IT'S SMOOTH
AND SOUND AND SOLID.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.003
THE OUTLINE IS CLEAN,
THE BLACK IS BLACK,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.047
THE COLOR IS BRIGHT,

18:52.297 --> 18:54.341
BUT THERE'S JUST A LOT
OF PROBLEMS WITH THE DESIGN.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.301
I CAN'T GET
AWAY FROM THIS HOODIE.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.303
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE CLOAK
OVER THE SKULL,

18:58.387 --> 19:00.180
WHICH GIVES IT EVEN
MORE OF THAT HOODIE LOOK.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.391
- I GUESS IT'S--I MEAN,
THAT'S MY STYLE.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.434
YOU KNOW, I TRY NOT TO DO
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.019
- I KNOW IT'S YOUR STYLE,
BUT I THINK THE SKULL

19:06.270 --> 19:08.063
COULD HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE MORE REFINED.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.315
BECAUSE IT WAS ON A GIRL,
IT LOOKS A LITTLE UGLY.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.067
- THE CREATIVITY IN IT'S GOOD,

19:12.317 --> 19:14.027
I JUST THINK YOU MAYBE
PUT TOO MUCH INTO IT.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.529
{\an8}WHEN I'M CREATING A TATTOO
FOR SOMEBODY,

19:15.612 --> 19:16.822
{\an8}I ALWAYS TRY TO LOOK
AT WHAT THE PERSON

19:16.905 --> 19:18.991
{\an8}LOOKS LIKE AND TRY
TO MAKE IT FIT THEM.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.909
AESTHETICALLY, I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE LET UP A LITTLE BIT

19:21.159 --> 19:22.536
MORE AND TRY
TO GIVE HER SOMETHING SOFT.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.746
- YOU DROPPED IT ON THIS ONE.

19:24.830 --> 19:27.499
IF YOU WOULD HAVE GONE WITH
A MORE REALISTIC, FINER LINE

19:27.583 --> 19:30.586
INSTEAD OF A HEAVY, BOLD,
CARTOONY STYLE,

19:30.669 --> 19:32.838
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD
A MUCH DIFFERENT FEEL.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.923
TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE ALWAYS SOLID,

19:35.007 --> 19:37.092
BUT THIS DESIGN IS PROBABLY ONE
OF MY LEAST FAVORITE

19:37.175 --> 19:41.305
I'VE SEEN FROM YOU
THIS COMPETITION.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.975
- JASON.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.769
HOW DID YOU LAND ON THIS VIEW?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.021
- SHE WANTED
SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE,

19:49.104 --> 19:51.064
SO I THOUGHT, "WELL,

19:51.148 --> 19:53.066
"LET'S JUST MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT
JUST TOOK SOMEBODY'S SOUL

19:53.150 --> 19:53.942
AND IT'S REVELING
IN THE POWER OF THAT."

19:54.192 --> 19:55.527
- YOU TOOK A BIG RISK

19:55.611 --> 19:57.279
ON THE ANGLE OF THAT SKULL,

19:57.362 --> 19:58.614
BUT YOU REALLY NAILED
THE CONTRAST

19:58.697 --> 20:00.032
WITH THAT SOUL ESCAPING.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.075
IT BREAKS IT UP REALLY WELL.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.952
AND THEN, YOU HAVE
SOME REALLY DENSE, DARK AREAS

20:04.036 --> 20:06.747
THAT MAKE IT WORK WITH
THAT SOFT SHADOW COMING THROUGH.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.874
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.500
- I'M REALLY IMPRESSED.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.461
IT'S TELLING A CREATIVE STORY.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.879
YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT THE GRIM REAPER WAS,

20:13.962 --> 20:16.173
AND REAPING YOUR SOUL,

20:16.256 --> 20:20.969
AND YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD
WITH THE CREATIVENESS.

20:21.053 --> 20:25.974
- ERIK.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.018
HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS IMAGERY?

20:28.101 --> 20:29.937
- OUT OF MY HEAD.
I LIVE IN MY SKETCHBOOK, SO--

20:30.228 --> 20:33.106
- AS FAR AS CREATIVE GOES,
I LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU DREW IT

20:33.190 --> 20:35.108
AND CREATED IT OUT OF NOTHING
AND IT'S YOUR STYLE.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.361
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE
WITH THE TATTOO IS THE SCYTHE.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.488
IT LOOKS LIKE PART OF THE CLOAK.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.782
AND THE COLORS DON'T EVEN MATCH
ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE.

20:41.865 --> 20:44.409
- THE SCYTHE IS AN OPAQUE BROWN
AND THE CLOAK IS BLACK AND GRAY,

20:44.493 --> 20:46.620
SO I KNOW THAT WILL LIGHTEN UP,
SO AS SOON AS IT HEALS,

20:46.703 --> 20:48.580
IT SHOULD STAND APART
A LITTLE BETTER.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.457
- THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
THAT YOU HAVE HERE IS

20:50.540 --> 20:51.875
THAT EVERYTHING
IS THE EXACT SAME SHAPE--

20:51.959 --> 20:54.127
THE EXACT SAME JAGGED LINES.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.130
THE SCYTHE HAS 'EM, THE CLOAK
HAS 'EM, THE SKULL HAS 'EM.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.174
IT'S SO JAGGED
THAT YOU DON'T DIFFERENTIATE

20:59.424 --> 21:01.593
YOUR PARTS AND PIECES
OTHER THAN WITH THE COLOR.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.221
- ON A COMPOSITION STANDPOINT,
IT'S A LITTLE AVERAGE.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.181
I DON'T THINK
YOU TOOK MANY RISKS,

21:06.264 --> 21:07.933
AND ESPECIALLY IN A COMPETITION
LIKE THIS,

21:08.016 --> 21:10.102
YOU REALLY HAVE TO CHALLENGE
YOUR OWN STATUS QUO.

21:10.394 --> 21:15.107
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
YOU'RE GONNA REALLY STAY IN IT.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.110
- CRIS.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.028
- TECHNICALLY,
IT'S PRETTY SMOOTH.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.989
DESIGN-WISE, THERE'S SOME WEIRD

21:22.072 --> 21:23.991
[bleep]
GOING ON WITH THIS TATTOO.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.243
- I WANTED TO DO
MORE OF A STYLIZED GRIM REAPER.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.203
I TRIED TO BE MORE CREATIVE
WITH IT.

21:28.286 --> 21:30.122
- I THINK YOU GOT TWO THINGS
CONFLICTING.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.040
YOU HAVE THIS TATTERED PART
OF THE CLOAK,

21:32.290 --> 21:34.459
AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS NICE
REFINED PART OF THE CLOAK.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.461
KIND OF REMINDS ME,
LIKE, OF A VIRGIN MARY.

21:36.545 --> 21:38.672
DOESN'T REALLY LOOK
LIKE A TOUGH GRIM REAPER.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.841
I THINK SOME TEETH AND STUFF
WOULD HAVE HELPED IT A LOT.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.427
- COMPOSITIONALLY, SOMETHING
JUST DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.137
THE WAY THE HAND'S POSITIONED,

21:45.387 --> 21:47.973
IT ALMOST LOOKS
LIKE IT'S ON THE SIDELINES

21:48.056 --> 21:49.975
READY TO ROOT FOR THE TEAM.

21:50.058 --> 21:52.519
DOESN'T HAVE A VERY STRONG
ENERGY LIKE IT SHOULD.

21:52.602 --> 21:54.479
- I'VE GIVEN YOU EVERY SHOVE
I COULD,

21:54.563 --> 21:56.023
AND YOU JUST KEEP
GIVING ME THE SAME STUFF.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.442
I CAN'T STAND THIS TATTOO.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.156
- JUDGES, IT'S TIME
TO DETERMINE A WINNER.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.033
WHO HAD THE BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY?

22:06.116 --> 22:08.076
- IF I HAD TO WEAR ONE
OF THE FIVE TATTOOS,

22:08.160 --> 22:10.162
I WOULD CHOOSE TO WEAR JASON'S.

22:10.245 --> 22:11.997
- I ONLY SAW ONE
THAT WAS THE GRIM REAPER,

22:12.080 --> 22:13.665
AND THAT WAS JASON.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.126
- MY TOP WOULD BE JASON,
ALSO.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.670
I THINK THAT YOU REALLY DID
CAPTURE A MOOD WITH THAT TATTOO,

22:18.754 --> 22:21.256
AND IT DID LOOK SINISTER, EVIL--

22:21.339 --> 22:23.300
IT HAD A WHOLE FEEL ABOUT IT
THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

22:23.383 --> 22:24.926
- FINAL DECISION.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.219
- JASON.
- JASON.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.763
{\an5}- JASON.
- JASON.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.806
- JASON.
- JASON.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.683
- THE WINNER OF BEST TATTOO
OF THE DAY IS JASON.

22:31.767 --> 22:32.976
- THANK YOU.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.102
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.271
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

22:36.354 --> 22:38.774
THE JUDGES WILL DELIBERATE
ON WHO WILL BE CLOSING SHOP.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.776
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT,

22:40.859 --> 22:41.526
AND WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
WHEN WE HAVE A DECISION.

22:49.493 --> 22:53.080
- I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.040
- THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE IT.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.042
- CONGRATS, JASON.
- YEAH.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.168
- THAT WAS THE COMEBACK
OF THE YEAR RIGHT THERE.

22:58.251 --> 22:59.669
- THANKS, GUYS.

22:59.753 --> 23:00.921
{\an8}- JASON'S TATTOOS
ARE SO INCONSISTENT.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.923
{\an8}HE'S UP AND DOWN, UP AND DOWN.

23:03.006 --> 23:04.800
YEAH, HE DID A GOOD ONE TODAY,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:04.883 --> 23:06.218
HE'S PROBABLY GONNA
DO A BAD ONE TOMORROW.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.261
I THINK YOU GOT AN EASY WIN.

23:08.345 --> 23:10.222
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A BLACK
AND GRAY SKULL HANDED TO YOU.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.057
- I DON'T THINK IT WAS--I DON'T
THINK IT WAS AN EASY WIN.

23:12.140 --> 23:14.142
- YOU KNOW?
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE JUST

23:14.392 --> 23:15.769
BEING A SORE LOSER,
BECAUSE I MEAN, REALLY DUDE.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.979
- NO, NO. I'M NOT BEING SORE.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.981
I'M JUST SAYING I THINK YOU
PROBABLY GOT AN EASIER CANVAS.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.192
- YOU JUST HAD ONE DOWN.
- YEAH, I KNOW, I-I--

23:22.275 --> 23:23.985
- GRANTED, IT WAS IN FRONT
OF SIX OF THE BAD-ASS JUDGES,

23:24.069 --> 23:26.071
BUT...
- THAT SHOULD HAVE--

23:26.154 --> 23:28.115
- IT PROVES THAT EVERYBODY
CAN DROP THE BALL, DUDE.

23:28.198 --> 23:29.324
CLEEN HAS BEEN UNDERESTIMATING
ME THIS WHOLE TIME.

23:29.407 --> 23:32.202
{\an8}ALL SIX JUDGES LOVED MY TATTOO.

23:32.285 --> 23:35.163
IN UNISON, ONE AFTER ANOTHER,
THEY CALLED MY NAME: JASON DUNN.

23:35.413 --> 23:37.874
WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT
MY TRACK RECORD NOW, CLEEN?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.128
- I'LL JUST SAY, LIKE,
SUBJECT MATTER OVERALL,

23:41.211 --> 23:43.046
BLACK AND GRAY, WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT EASIER TO DO

23:43.130 --> 23:44.589
THAN A COLORED GRIM REAPER.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.383
- WELL, SHE WANTED COLOR TOO,

23:46.466 --> 23:48.301
BUT I TALKED HER
INTO BLACK AND GRAY.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.220
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ENTITLED,
BRO, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:50.470 --> 23:52.180
I'M SICK OF YOUR [bleep].

23:52.264 --> 23:54.099
- MAYBE I DID HAVE
A TOUGH CANVAS.

23:54.182 --> 23:55.892
- THOSE ARE THE CARDS
YOU GOT DEALT.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.019
YOU THINK NOTHING FAZES YOU?
IT WILL.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.688
AND IF YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE TOP THREE, FINE.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.814
I'M BRINGING IT TOO.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.194
[ominous music]

24:06.278 --> 24:09.197
♪ ♪

24:09.281 --> 24:11.199
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY
WE'RE LOOKING AT GRIM REAPERS,

24:11.283 --> 24:13.410
TESTING FOR CONTRAST,
COMPOSITION,

24:13.493 --> 24:15.245
AND CREATIVITY.

24:15.328 --> 24:17.330
LET'S START WITH MARK.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.166
- MY MAJOR PROBLEMS
WITH THIS TATTOO

24:19.249 --> 24:20.167
IS THERE IS A COUPLE
OF DESIRED EFFECTS

24:20.458 --> 24:22.002
THAT HE WAS NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE.

24:22.085 --> 24:24.045
THE DEPTH OF THAT DARK SHADOW

24:24.129 --> 24:25.255
IN THE FACE WITH JUST THOSE EYES
SHOWING THROUGH--

24:25.505 --> 24:27.215
IT JUST DIDN'T COME ACROSS.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.800
- CREATIVELY, I THINK
HE COULD HAVE DONE IT

24:28.884 --> 24:30.468
MORE OF A SKULL SHAPE IN IT.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.387
I THINK RIGHT NOW,
YOU'RE LOOKING

24:32.471 --> 24:33.555
AT MORE OF A GHOST
THAN A GRIM REAPER.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.390
- COMPOSITION, I FEEL,

24:35.473 --> 24:37.392
IS IRRELEVANT
BECAUSE THE DESIGN--

24:37.475 --> 24:39.728
THE LAYOUT
IS JUST ALL AROUND BAD.

24:39.811 --> 24:42.314
- IT LOOKS LIKE A CHILD DRAWING.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.982
- NEXT UP, WE HAVE CLEEN.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.110
- I THINK THE COLORS ARE GARISH.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.654
THE BLUE IS WAY
TOO WALL-TO-WALL.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.698
- IF WE REALLY JUST LOOK
AT THE DESIGN

24:51.781 --> 24:53.867
AND WHAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE WRINKLES OF FABRIC,

24:53.950 --> 24:56.369
IT'S JUST WIGGLY,
BLUE [bleep].

24:56.453 --> 24:59.247
- THIS IS A SILLY ATTEMPT
AT A GRIM REAPER.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.292
THIS IS CLEEN'S WORST TATTOO,
AESTHETICALLY AND ARTISTICALLY.

25:02.375 --> 25:04.669
- NEXT UP, WE HAVE CRIS.

25:04.753 --> 25:07.380
- CREATIVELY, I THINK
THAT HE REALLY MISSED THE MARK.

25:07.464 --> 25:08.965
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT,
I JUST KEEP SEEING

25:09.049 --> 25:10.967
A VIRGIN MARY-TYPE SKELETON.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.094
- YEAH.
- I DON'T SEE A GRIM REAPER.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.264
- HE'S JUST BLANKETED
THIS DESIGN WITH THE SAME SHADE.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.308

34:19.223 --> 34:21.141
- HOW MANY COLORS
YOU GONNA DO ON THAT FLOWER?

34:21.225 --> 34:23.018
- JUST BLUE AND MAGENTA.
- THE COLOR CHOICES

34:23.101 --> 34:24.728
THAT MARK'S MAKING
ARE JUST REALLY POOR,

34:24.812 --> 34:26.938
AND THEY'RE NOT GONNA
LOOK GOOD ON THE SKIN.

34:27.023 --> 34:28.858
- 15 MINUTES LEFT.

34:28.940 --> 34:29.358
- BOTH THOSE GUYS ARE SWEATING.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.659
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE BOTH EQUALLY CRAPPY.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.161
IT'S A TOUGH ONE, MAN.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.161
- FIVE...

34:41.245 --> 34:42.163
FOUR...

34:42.246 --> 34:43.164
THREE...

34:43.246 --> 34:44.165
TWO...

34:44.248 --> 34:45.917
ONE...

34:46.000 --> 34:46.958
TIME'S UP.
MACHINES DOWN.

34:47.043 --> 34:47.960
NO MORE TATTOOING.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.922
- WHO'S GOING HOME?

34:51.005 --> 34:52.672
- CRIS' TATTOO
HAS TOO MUCH GOING ON.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.925
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF SKIN

34:54.007 --> 34:55.885
TO MAKE THIS THING BREATHE.

34:55.967 --> 34:56.010
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT BETTER THAN MINE.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.263
- COOL, MAN.

34:59.347 --> 35:01.015
- MARK'S TATTOO IS WAY TOO DARK.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.892
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE COLORFUL AND VIBRANT,

35:03.142 --> 35:04.393
BUT HIS LOOKS
LIKE A PUDDLE OF [bleep].

35:07.355 --> 35:09.524
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.776
- YOU TWO ARE ON THE CHOPPING
BLOCK RIGHT NOW.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.945
- I'M READY TO FIGHT.

35:14.028 --> 35:14.904
RUBENDALL'S GONNA BE FIRED UP,
BRO.

35:15.154 --> 35:16.489
I GOT SOMETHING TO PROVE.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.449
- I SEE IT IN YOU, FOR SURE.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.701
CRIS, YOU'RE JUST SO QUIET
ALL THE TIME.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.411
- I'M JUST TIRED, YOU KNOW?
LIKE, I'M JUST TIRED OF--

35:22.495 --> 35:24.872
- HEY, [bleep]
GETTING SERIOUS TODAY.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.749
- I'M CONFIDENT IN MY TATTOO.
- YEAH.

35:26.833 --> 35:27.875
- YOU KNOW,
OBVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW MUCH

35:27.959 --> 35:30.002
ABOUT THE WHOLE SUBJECT.

35:30.086 --> 35:30.962
- THAT'S WHAT I'M BANKING ON
TO GET THE WIN.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.464
- BUT I STYLIZED IT MY OWN WAY

35:33.548 --> 35:35.633
THAT I WOULD UNDERSTAND IT, THAT
I FEEL LIKE I DID A GOOD JOB.

35:35.716 --> 35:37.385
- YEAH, BUT FUNDAMENTALS
ARE FUNDAMENTALS, CRIS, AND--

35:37.468 --> 35:39.512
- BUT THAT'S WHAT I USED.
I USED--

35:39.595 --> 35:41.222
- I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S A COP
OUT AT THIS POINT, MAN.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.307
I MEAN, YOU KNOW--
- NO, NO, NO.

35:43.391 --> 35:44.976
I'M NOT--NOT AT ALL.
IT'S JUST THAT I DON'T DO IT.

35:45.226 --> 35:47.019
- HEY, YOU BETTER
BRING IT DOWN THERE,

35:47.103 --> 35:48.896
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SIX JUDGES
AGAIN

35:48.980 --> 35:50.982
THAT ARE NOT [bleep] AROUND.
- WE'LL SEE.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.859
- I WANT BOTH OF YOU TO GO.
I DON'T CARE.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.735
- YEAH, AND YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME
TOO, MAN.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.195
- I'LL GO HOME
WHEN THE CASH IS IN MY HAND.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.198
[rock music]

35:59.282 --> 36:00.867
♪ ♪

36:08.624 --> 36:11.252
- MARK AND CRIS,

36:11.335 --> 36:14.172
YOU FACED OFF TATTOOING A DESIGN
BY JASON.

36:14.255 --> 36:16.465
A SPOT IN THE TOP FOUR
IS ON THE LINE.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.050
ONE OF YOU WILL WIN,

36:18.134 --> 36:22.013
AND ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

36:22.263 --> 36:23.681
LET'S SEE HOW YOU DID.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.893
CRIS.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.562
- TECHNICALLY, I THINK
IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD FROM AFAR,

36:29.645 --> 36:32.940
BUT WHAT WAS THE STRATEGY
BEHIND SHRINKING THIS DESIGN?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.067
- I WAS JUST INTIMIDATED
TO DO IT AT THAT SIZE,

36:35.151 --> 36:36.986
'CAUSE I THOUGHT THAT I
WOULD TAKE LONGER WITH IT.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.030
- I THINK YOU COULD'VE
DONE IT FASTER IF YOU

36:39.113 --> 36:41.073
ENLARGED THE DESIGN
AND SIMPLIFIED IT AS YOU WENT.

36:41.157 --> 36:45.036
I THINK THAT CENTER'S GONNA
BE UNREADABLE IN THE FUTURE.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.371
- THE THING I HATE ABOUT THIS
TATTOO THE MOST IS

36:47.455 --> 36:50.917
HOW MUCH REALLY LIGHT BABY BLUE
AND WHITE IS IN THIS WATER.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.002
THOSE LIGHT COLORS
ARE NOT ENOUGH CONTRAST

36:53.085 --> 36:55.755
TO THIS PERSON'S SKIN TONE
TO MAKE IT WORTHWHILE

36:55.838 --> 36:58.507
SPENDING ALL THAT TIME
STABBING THIS GUY WITH A NEEDLE.

36:58.591 --> 36:59.842
- THESE ARE THE THINGS

36:59.926 --> 37:02.094
THAT SCREAM INEXPERIENCE

37:02.178 --> 37:04.013
AND SCREAM YOUNG,

37:04.263 --> 37:05.806
AND THAT'S DISTURBING TO ME,

37:05.890 --> 37:07.099
BECAUSE YOU'RE COMING HERE

37:07.183 --> 37:08.476
TO TAKE THE TITLE OF SOMEBODY

37:08.559 --> 37:09.977
WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING ALL AROUND,

37:10.061 --> 37:12.146
AND YOU DON'T.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.065
- MARK.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.442
- FIRST GLANCE, IT HAS A PRETTY
GOOD OVERALL LOOK TO IT.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.069
I REALLY LIKE THE WAY YOU
USED THE LIGHT GRAY IN THE WATER

37:18.319 --> 37:19.862
TO LET THE FLOWER
STAND OUT STRONG.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.989
BUT I THINK THERE'S A FEW AREAS

37:22.073 --> 37:23.991
IN THIS TATTOO WHERE THE LINE
WORK HAS SOME PROBLEMS.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.826
THESE LITTLE PETALS
THAT SWING EVERYWHERE--

37:25.910 --> 37:28.037
THERE'S SOME KINKS
IN A FEW OF 'EM.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.914
- THERE'S THIS HUGE PINK PETAL
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DESIGN,

37:29.997 --> 37:32.124
AND IT'S JUST AN EYESORE.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.085
YOU SHOULD HAVE ADDED A FOLD
AND YOU DIDN'T.

37:34.168 --> 37:36.128
- I THINK WHAT I JUST FIGURED
WAS ONE

37:36.212 --> 37:37.505
THAT YOU COULD SEE THAT ACTUALLY
FELL THE OTHER DIRECTION.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.507
- YOU WOULD SEE TWO PARTS OF IT.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.592
LOOK AT THE CONSISTENCY
OF ALL THE OTHER PETALS.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.011
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.930
- WHAT KIND OF TATTOOS
DO YOU NORMALLY DO?

37:46.013 --> 37:47.932
- I DO SOME JAPANESE
AND UNDERWATER STUFF.

37:48.015 --> 37:49.976
- HOW COME YOU JUST
DIDN'T DESTROY THIS, DUDE,

37:50.059 --> 37:52.061
WITH THAT STYLE
IF YOU'VE DONE IT SO MUCH?

37:52.144 --> 37:54.105
- I WAS A LITTLE RATTLED
WITH THE DRAWING.

37:54.188 --> 37:56.148
JASON DREW SUCH A CRAZY PIECE.
I THINK HE DREW, LIKE,

37:56.232 --> 37:58.526
A SIX-HOUR TATTOO THAT I HAD
TO TRY TO DO IN FOUR HOURS.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.944
- I KNOW YOU'RE
ON A TIME RESTRAINT,

38:00.027 --> 38:02.238
BUT I REALLY EXPECTED A LOT.

38:02.321 --> 38:03.948
RIGHT NOW, I'M STILL UP
IN THE AIR IN MY MIND

38:04.031 --> 38:06.450
WITH WHO I CHOOSE.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.035
- LET'S DO A SIDE-BY-SIDE
COMPARISON

38:08.119 --> 38:10.079
AND SEE WHERE WE'RE ALL SITTING.

38:10.162 --> 38:11.956
{\an8}- AT A GLANCE, BOTH OF THEM
STAND OUT AS WHAT THEY ARE.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.833
{\an8}BOTH OF THEM DID A DECENT JOB.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.085
{\an8}- WHO'S GOING HOME?

38:16.168 --> 38:17.628
{\an8}- MARK, YOU'VE BEEN
TATTOOING FOR 20 YEARS.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.255
{\an8}YOU DID CERTAIN THINGS RIGHT,

38:19.338 --> 38:22.049
{\an8}BUT YOUR TECHNICAL ABILITY
IS NOT AS STRONG.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.136
- I KNOW FOR A FACT I CAN STILL
TAKE OUT ANY ONE OF THESE GUYS.

38:25.219 --> 38:27.138
I CAN SEE THE FINALE
RIGHT AHEAD.

38:27.221 --> 38:30.141
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO STAY IN THIS COMPETITION.

38:30.224 --> 38:31.058
- CRIS,
HOW LONG YOU BEEN TATTOOING?

38:31.142 --> 38:33.144
- EIGHT YEARS.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.062
- CRIS, YOU'VE MADE MISTAKES.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.064
AND THE DESIGN FLAWS--

38:37.148 --> 38:38.232
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THEM
AS THEY WERE COMING.

38:38.482 --> 38:40.484
IT SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.236
- I'VE JUST BEEN LETTING
EVERYTHING GET TO ME, MAN,

38:42.319 --> 38:44.196
AND IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD
FOR ME.

38:44.280 --> 38:45.156
IT WAS NERVES,
IT WAS MY MACHINE--

38:45.448 --> 38:47.158
IT WAS EVERYTHING, HONESTLY.

38:47.241 --> 38:48.451
- I THINK YOU GAVE UP, MAN.

38:48.534 --> 38:49.869
YOU JUST CHECKED OUT.

38:49.952 --> 38:51.620
- YOU HAVE TO STAND UP FOR IT.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.539
- I KNOW YOU GUYS
SEE A LOT IN ME,

38:53.622 --> 38:56.167
AND I--YOU KNOW,
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.628
- IT COMES DOWN
TO WHO WANTS IT MORE.

38:59.712 --> 39:00.880
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S POLL THE JUDGES.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.131
WHO WINS THE FACE OFF?

39:02.381 --> 39:04.216
{\an8}- I AM LEANING
TOWARDS MARK'S TATTOO

39:04.300 --> 39:06.218
{\an8}JUST 'CAUSE THE OVERALL FEEL
IS MORE OPEN.

39:06.302 --> 39:08.304
{\an8}ALL THE FROSTING
YOU PACKED ON THIS TATTOO, CRIS,

39:08.387 --> 39:11.474
{\an8}IS WEIGHING IT DOWN.

39:11.557 --> 39:13.642
- NIKKO.
- I'VE GOT TO GO WITH MARK.

39:13.726 --> 39:15.478
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF HEART.
YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR SPOT.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.981
YOU KNOW, AND CRIS, YOU'RE NOT.
- ROSE.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.067
- MARK.
- MIKE.

39:21.150 --> 39:24.111
- YOU'RE NOT SHOWING
YOU WANT IT, SO MY VOTE IS MARK.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.738
- CHRIS.

39:25.821 --> 39:28.115
- I'M GOING WITH MARK.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.992
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:34.705 --> 39:40.002
CRIS YOU DO NOT HAVE
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE <i> INK MASTER.</i>

39:40.086 --> 39:42.421
- I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

39:42.505 --> 39:44.090
TO WIN THIS COMPETITION
RIGHT NOW.

39:44.173 --> 39:46.258
I DO THINK YOU HAVE ABILITY.

39:46.342 --> 39:48.219
BUT CRIS,
GET YOUR ATTITUDE STRAIGHT.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.555
DON'T HO-HUM YOUR WAY
THROUGH THIS [bleep].

39:51.639 --> 39:54.475
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.983
- IT'S A HARD LIFE LIVING HERE.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.152
I TRIED NOT TO DOUBT MYSELF
AS MUCH AS I COULD,

40:05.236 --> 40:07.279
BUT I LET THE COMPETITION
GET INTO MY HEAD WAY TOO MUCH.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.907
I TRIED AS HARD
AS I POSSIBLY COULD

40:09.990 --> 40:10.574
AND I CAME UP SHORT.

40:17.414 --> 40:19.625
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER:</i>

40:19.708 --> 40:22.169

STANDING.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.839
THIS IS THE TIME
TO FIGHT LIKE NEVER BEFORE.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.173
- SO HOW MANY TIMES
YOU GONNA SIT HERE AND TALK

40:26.257 --> 40:28.217
[bleep] ABOUT MY TATTOO?

40:28.300 --> 40:29.927
- I'M READY TO DEFEND.
I'M READY TO FIGHT.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.595
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO THE FINALE.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.806
- OKAY,
YOU EGOTISTICAL [bleep].

40:33.889 --> 40:35.891
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT DID
A TATTOO THAT'S NOT CENTERED!

40:35.975 --> 40:37.309
IF YOU KNEW HOW TO TATTOO,
YOU'D HAVE A [bleep] INK

40:37.393 --> 40:39.061
IN THE SKIN, BUT YOU DON'T!

40:39.145 --> 40:41.355
- THIS IS THE END OF THE ROAD,
SO GO OUT AS HARD AS YOU CAN.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.315
- I GOT [bleep] CRAZINESS
WITH THIS TATTOO.

40:43.399 --> 40:44.316
- YOU HAD TO KNOCK IT
OUT OF THE PARK.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.943
- IT'S JUST NOT SOLID.

40:46.026 --> 40:47.194
YOU'RE A BETTER ARTIST ON PAPER.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.612
- I GOT THE HEART [bleep] TIGER.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.364
- OH, [bleep] CHOKE YOUR ASS.

40:50.447 --> 40:51.740
- AND I'LL WIN EVERY [bleep]
TIME.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.617
- HEY, GUYS, GUYS, DON'T.

40:53.701 --> 40:53.742
- YOU DO NOT WANT
TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.
