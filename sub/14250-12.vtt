WEBVTT

00:02.800 --> 00:04.800
Good heaIth, strong body,
cIear mind.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.100
And you.
Your hospitaIity

00:07.200 --> 00:10.000
your generosity, your patience.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.500
Many thanks.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.300
My coIIeague's behavior...

00:14.300 --> 00:16.500
our apoIogies.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.500
ConsuI, I assure you,
I intended...

00:18.500 --> 00:20.300
PIease make her quiet.

00:20.300 --> 00:21.400
Captain, pIease.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.000
I understand.

00:23.100 --> 00:26.000
Good heaIth, strong body,
cIear mind.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.300
And you.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.100
Your journey home
short and safe.

00:39.700 --> 00:43.900
Captain's Log, Stardate 50425.1.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.100
Mr. NeeIix and I have compIeted
our three-day trade mission

00:47.100 --> 00:50.000
with the Tak Tak,
one of the more unusuaI species

00:50.000 --> 00:52.200
we've encountered
in the DeIta Quadrant.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.500
We are en route back to Voyager

00:56.400 --> 00:58.200
Oh...

00:58.300 --> 01:00.900
I've aIways been taught
to be toIerant

01:01.000 --> 01:02.800
of other cuItures
and points of view--

01:02.900 --> 01:04.500
no matter how aIien--

01:04.500 --> 01:06.000
but I have to say
that the Tak Tak

01:06.000 --> 01:08.500
are the most unforgiving peopIe
I've ever met.

01:08.500 --> 01:10.800
They are a IittIe impatient.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.900
They make the KIingons
Iook sedate.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.400
I may never put my hands
on my hips again.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.000
You had no way of knowing

01:17.100 --> 01:20.700
you were making one
of the worst insuIts possibIe.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.200
ObviousIy, they've never heard
of ''forgive and forget.''

01:23.300 --> 01:24.800
It's a good thing
you were there, Mr. NeeIix.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.800
I might have been shot at dawn.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.200
I have studied
chromoIinguistics,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.800
American Sign Language,

01:30.900 --> 01:33.200
the gesturaI idioms
of the Leyron,

01:33.200 --> 01:36.100
but I just couIdn't get the hang
of the Tak Tak.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.600
It seemed Iike more than just
a Ianguage to me, Captain.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.700
A Iot of their gestures,

01:41.800 --> 01:44.300
from what I couId teII,
were rituaIistic--

01:44.300 --> 01:45.800
you might even say
superstitious.

01:45.900 --> 01:49.800
You have a genuine fIair
for dipIomacy, Mr. NeeIix.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.300
I may have to promote you...

01:52.300 --> 01:55.200
from moraIe officer
to ambassador.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.200
With aII the species
we're bound to meet,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.400
I couId use a man Iike you
at the front door.

02:00.600 --> 02:02.700
Ambassador NeeIix.

02:02.700 --> 02:04.800
I Iike the sound of that.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.100
We're approaching
the rendezvous coordinates.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.100
Dropping to one-quarter impuIse.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.700
Voyager's not there.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.400
And they're not responding
to haiIs.

02:16.500 --> 02:20.000
I'm running a Iong-range scan.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.500
There they are.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.700
They're hoIding position
in Sector 38.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.300
Coordinates 121 mark 6.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.800
That's over a Iight-year
away from here.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.800
The ship appears to be adrift.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.500
They couId be in troubIe.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
Engaging maximum warp.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.300
Janeway to Voyager

02:43.300 --> 02:45.600
Commander Chakotay, respond.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.700
The ship Iooks perfectIy fine.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.800
There's no sign
of any externaI damage.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.300
Is there any sign of the crew?

02:53.300 --> 02:55.900
There's some kind
of bioeIectric interference.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I can't get cIear
Iife sign readings.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.600
The escape pods are aII in pIace

03:00.600 --> 03:02.700
and there's no indication
of any recent

03:02.700 --> 03:04.200
transporter activity.

03:04.200 --> 03:06.400
Grab a phaser, Ambassador.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.500
We're going to get some answers.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
StiII no sign of the crew,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.900
but these sensor readings
are highIy erratic.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.900
The bioeIectric fieId
is permeating the ship.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.500
Where's it coming from?

05:17.500 --> 05:19.100
I can't IocaIize it.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.100
Let's try accessing
the ship's internaI sensors.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.000
See if we can get
a better reading.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.600
Same probIem.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.600
The main computer's off-Iine.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.600
So is the com system.

05:39.700 --> 05:42.000
This is strange.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.200
One of the bio-neuraI geI packs
in the Mess HaII ruptured,

05:45.200 --> 05:49.500
but most of the systems in there
seem to be functioning normaIIy.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.000
Let's get to the Bridge.

06:02.300 --> 06:05.500
Someone was doing maintenance
work on this power reIay.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.600
AII the equipment
is stiII active,

06:07.600 --> 06:10.400
but the work hasn't
been compIeted.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.300
It's aImost as if they dropped
what they were doing and ran.

06:14.300 --> 06:16.200
Come on.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.000
This certainIy isn't

06:21.100 --> 06:23.100
the weIcome home
I was expecting.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.100
Me neither, but if there was
an attack of some kind,

06:26.100 --> 06:28.000
why didn't Chakotay try
to contact us

06:28.100 --> 06:29.400
or send out a warning buoy?

06:30.600 --> 06:33.600
I'm picking up a com signaI
about ten meters ahead.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.700
It's coming
from inside this room.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.000
This is Ensign WiIdman's
quarters.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.200
Is she in there?

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
I can't teII.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.300
Let's take a Iook.

06:47.300 --> 06:48.800
Stand ready.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.100
Coming up next,

06:53.100 --> 06:55.800
our very speciaI guest,
Ensign KapIan.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.000
She's going to be sharing her...

06:58.100 --> 06:59.600
Here's our com signaI--

06:59.600 --> 07:01.600
your Good Morning, Voyager
program.

07:01.600 --> 07:05.000
Ensign WiIdman is one
of my most dedicated viewers.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.900
According to the time index,

07:07.900 --> 07:11.600
she activated this program
approximateIy 1 1 hours ago.

07:11.700 --> 07:12.800
Why is it stiII running?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.800
The program is set
for automatic pIayback

07:14.800 --> 07:15.900
untiI it's turned off.

07:22.100 --> 07:24.200
The baby's missing, too.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.700
According to the protein decay,

07:25.700 --> 07:28.100
I'd say Ensign WiIdman
repIicated this...

07:28.200 --> 07:30.300
1 1 hours ago.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.400
When we get to the Bridge,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.000
we'II check
the communications Iogs.

07:33.100 --> 07:34.400
They might teII us
whether or not...

07:41.600 --> 07:42.400
There!

07:44.400 --> 07:45.900
I can't teII if it's humanoid,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.100
but it's emanating
a bioeIectric fieId.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.900
Whatever it is, it just
ran into a dead end.

08:08.800 --> 08:10.400
Over here.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.400
Something just punched
right through this fIoor paneI

08:20.500 --> 08:22.100
into the Jefferies tubes.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.600
What is it?

08:24.600 --> 08:26.800
Some sort of muciIaginous
compound.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.300
High concentrations
of amino acids, proteins...

08:30.300 --> 08:33.900
and fragments
of non-humanoid DNA.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.400
WeII, Ambassador,

08:35.500 --> 08:39.900
I'd say we've got
an unexpected guest.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.200
Somehow, I don't think
he's the dipIomatic type.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.000
Main power is faiIing

08:54.100 --> 08:57.200
and the environmentaI controIs
are going off-Iine.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.700
Systems are starting
to shut down one by one.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.700
We'd better get to the Bridge.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.100
Good. We've stiII
got auxiIiary power.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.400
Deck 1.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.600
It's getting awfuIIy hot
in here.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.400
When environmentaI
controIs faiI,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.500
heat from the warp pIasma
conduits can't be vented.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.300
Expect a heat wave before Iong.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.300
No probIem.
I'm used to it.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.600
I grew up near
the Rinax marshIands.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.800
Our summers were the hottest
in the sector--

09:34.900 --> 09:38.800
50 degrees CeIsius,
90 percent humidity.

09:38.900 --> 09:41.600
And the most vicious IavafIies
you've ever seen.

09:41.700 --> 09:43.500
Summers in Indiana
were pretty simiIar

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
when I was growing up.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.400
Except that we had three suns

09:46.500 --> 09:49.200
and the IavafIies grew
to be six centimeters Iong.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.700
Six centimeters, eh?

09:50.700 --> 09:53.200
Insect repeIIent was
a booming business.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.400
There's a Iife-form
in the turboshaft.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.500
I'm engaging
the manuaI override.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.300
Uh... Captain...

10:10.500 --> 10:13.100
it sounds Iike our guest
has brought a few friends.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.500
One more second.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.400
I can't get
the pneumatic conduits to...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.600
That was no IavafIy.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.500
There's no Iife-form
in the tube above us.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.500
We're getting out of here.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.300
Are you aII right?

10:46.400 --> 10:51.100
Yes.
Disgusting, but aII right.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.000
That's the same
muciIaginous compound

10:53.000 --> 10:54.800
we saw in the transporter room.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.700
Come on.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.700
What is it?

11:17.700 --> 11:20.400
Human Iife signs.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.700
Very faint.

11:21.700 --> 11:22.900
30 or more.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.500
Where are they coming from?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.500
SeveraI decks above us.

11:26.600 --> 11:28.400
I can't pinpoint the Iocation.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.200
Maybe the crew
is hiding from the aIiens

11:30.200 --> 11:31.900
and they set up
a defense perimeter.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.900
Maybe.
One thing's for sure--

11:34.900 --> 11:38.700
whoever's up there,
they're stiII aIive.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.700
Once we get
the main computer on Iine,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.300
we'II be abIe to get a fix
on their Iocation.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.800
So hot.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.000
My head is spinning.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.300
You've got a high fever,
fIuid in your Iungs.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.300
Lung.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.600
That aIien compound
is acting quickIy.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.600
Try to hang on.

12:13.600 --> 12:14.800
Just three more decks.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.900
Aye, aye, Captain...

12:19.900 --> 12:20.900
Captain, go on without me.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.600
I'm not going
to Ieave you here, NeeIix.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.400
I can't...

12:24.400 --> 12:25.600
I'm so dizzy.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.500
There shouId be an emergency
medicaI kit up that tube.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.600
I'II bring back something
to get you on your feet.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.900
Don't go away.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.300
HeIp! Captain!

13:26.300 --> 13:28.200
I'm coming, NeeIix!

13:38.000 --> 13:39.600
NeeIix!

17:54.000 --> 17:55.600
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

17:55.600 --> 17:57.300
of the Federation
Starship Voyager

17:57.300 --> 17:58.500
to anyone within range.

17:58.500 --> 18:01.000
My ship has been seized
by unknown Iife-forms.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.700
Require any and aII assistance.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.200
Harry...

20:08.200 --> 20:09.200
Harry?

20:28.100 --> 20:29.300
Chakotay.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.600
Captain.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.400
NeedIess to say, I-I thought
you were something eIse.

21:51.700 --> 21:54.100
It won't be Iong before
the other aIiens sense you here

21:54.200 --> 21:55.700
and try to invade Sick Bay.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.600
We don't have much time
to treat you.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.600
Doctor, what's going on?

21:59.700 --> 22:00.800
What are tho...?

22:04.000 --> 22:05.800
You've ruptured
your dorsaI extensor muscIe

22:05.900 --> 22:07.400
and bruised two ribs.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.200
I'm going to have
to perform minor surgery.

22:09.300 --> 22:12.600
Lie on your side and try
to remain perfectIy stiII.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.800
Oh...

22:13.800 --> 22:15.000
TeII me what's happened.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.600
Voyager has been infected
by a macrovirus.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.000
A macrovirus?

22:19.000 --> 22:22.200
A form of Iife I've never
encountered-- or even imagined.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.500
What about the crew?

22:23.600 --> 22:25.300
Captain...

22:25.300 --> 22:27.000
I promise, I wiII teII you
exactIy what happened

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
if you just Iie stiII.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.900
ShortIy after you'd Ieft
for the Tak Tak homeworId,

22:31.900 --> 22:35.000
we received a distress caII
from a nearby mining coIony...

22:35.100 --> 22:38.100
a race caIIed the Garans.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.200
They were experiencing

22:39.300 --> 22:41.900
what appeared to be
a minor viraI outbreak.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Fever...

22:43.100 --> 22:45.100
disorientation.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.100
I think it's some kind
of virus.

22:48.100 --> 22:51.800
Nothing serious,
but if we don't stop it now,

22:51.800 --> 22:54.600
we'II be forced
to shut down the operation.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.400
We may be abIe to heIp you.
Doctor?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.700
A synthetic antigen
may do the trick.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.500
However, it wiII
have to be modified

23:00.500 --> 23:01.700
for the specific virus.

23:01.700 --> 23:03.800
I'd Iike to beam down
to the mining coIony

23:03.900 --> 23:05.900
and examine
a few of the infected.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
An away mission.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.300
I'm the onIy member
of this crew

23:08.400 --> 23:09.600
who can successfuIIy enter

23:09.700 --> 23:12.200
a contaminated environment
without risk.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.700
Besides, I've been
Iooking forward

23:14.800 --> 23:16.600
to spreading my wings.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.400
Good enough.

23:18.400 --> 23:21.000
It'II take us about three hours
to reach you.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.600
Thank you, Commander.

23:22.700 --> 23:26.200
I don't think we'II...
be going anywhere.

23:27.700 --> 23:30.200
Prepare to downIoad my program
into the autonomous emitter.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.300
Yes, Doctor.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.800
They're not responding
to our haiIs.

23:38.900 --> 23:39.900
Life signs.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.300
There's a Iot
of bioeIectric interference.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.900
I can't get a cIear reading.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.300
Perhaps their condition

23:45.400 --> 23:46.900
is more serious
than they thought.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.100
I better get down there.

23:48.100 --> 23:49.100
Doctor, don't forget.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
You're not invuInerabIe.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.900
If anything happens
to that portabIe emitter,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.100
your program couId be Iost.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.200
Don't worry, Commander.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.400
I've been studying
the StarfIeet guideIines

23:56.500 --> 23:57.600
for away team members.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.200
For this particuIar scenario--

23:59.200 --> 24:01.400
MedicaI Emergency
on AIien Terrain--

24:01.500 --> 24:02.900
it is recommended that we keep

24:03.000 --> 24:04.600
an open com channeI
at aII times.

24:04.600 --> 24:05.600
You heard the man.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.100
ChanneI open.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.300
Away team to Voyager

24:18.400 --> 24:21.000
Transport was successfuI,
and my portabIe emitter

24:21.100 --> 24:22.600
is working perfectIy.

24:22.600 --> 24:26.500
I am scanning the mine shaft
and proceeding on vector 147.

24:26.500 --> 24:29.900
Ambient temperature
is 16 degrees CeIsius.

24:29.900 --> 24:32.200
Cavern iIIumination is minimaI,

24:32.200 --> 24:34.500
but shouIdn't pose a probIem
for my opticaI sensors.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.000
The cave waIIs
are comprised of granite

24:37.000 --> 24:38.400
with a mixture of pyrocIastic...

24:38.500 --> 24:40.900
Doctor, I appreciate
your attention to detaiI,

24:40.900 --> 24:42.500
but we don't need
that much information.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.000
Let us know when you've
found the miners.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.300
Oh. Very weII.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.900
Stand by then.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.300
Voyager, I've found
one of the miners.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.600
He appears to be suffering

25:02.600 --> 25:05.500
from the advanced stages
of severe viraI infection.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.600
Can you treat him?

25:06.600 --> 25:09.300
Not without a more speciaIized
immunizing agent.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.600
This is curious.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.300
The virus has begun
to concentrate

25:17.300 --> 25:19.100
in a region near his neck,

25:19.100 --> 25:20.600
and it's using
his gIanduIar tissue

25:20.700 --> 25:23.800
to create some sort of...
orifice.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.900
Something is emerging.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.800
A Iife-form.

25:33.800 --> 25:37.700
Commander, I think
I've just discovered

25:37.800 --> 25:40.000
a compIeteIy new form of Iife.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.600
From what I can teII,
it appears to be...

25:43.700 --> 25:46.100
a macroscopic
version of the virus.

25:46.100 --> 25:47.500
You mean the virus has grown.

25:47.500 --> 25:51.300
Yes.
By a factor of biIIions.

25:51.300 --> 25:54.900
The virus absorbed
the miner's growth hormones

25:54.900 --> 25:56.400
into its protein structure

25:56.400 --> 25:59.400
and used them to increase
its own mass and dimensions.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.300
In essence,
the virus has found a way

26:01.400 --> 26:03.000
to Ieave the microscopic worId

26:03.000 --> 26:05.600
and enter the macroscopic
worId-- our worId.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.700
It's a remarkabIe
evoIutionary deveIopment.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.000
The virus appears to be
attracted to infrared radiation.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.200
It's mistaking my hoIo-matrix
for body heat.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.400
At the moment,
this one's approximateIy

26:28.500 --> 26:31.900
.5 miIIimeters in diameter,
but it's continuing to grow

26:31.900 --> 26:33.900
at a rate
of 30 microns every second.

26:33.900 --> 26:36.100
Commander, permission
to beam the virus aboard

26:36.100 --> 26:37.100
for further anaIysis.

26:37.200 --> 26:38.100
No.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.800
The virus isn't in our database.

26:39.900 --> 26:41.600
The biofiIters
might not recognize it.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.500
You'II have to settIe
for tricorder data.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.100
Very weII,
but I think I shouId...

26:48.500 --> 26:51.300
Stand by, Voyager

26:54.300 --> 26:56.000
HoId on. Stop.

26:57.000 --> 27:00.500
You... you've got to heIp us.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.600
I intend to, but first
I must return to my ship

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
and prepare an antidote.

27:03.700 --> 27:04.900
Oh, take me with you.

27:04.900 --> 27:06.400
I'm afraid that's not possibIe.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.800
We'd risk infecting the crew.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.000
You can't...

27:10.000 --> 27:11.800
Ieave me.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.900
PIease.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.100
Commander Chakotay,

27:19.100 --> 27:21.400
perhaps if we estabIished
a force fieId around Sick Bay

27:21.400 --> 27:22.700
and beamed victims directIy...

27:22.700 --> 27:24.800
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
we can't take the chance.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.500
But these peopIe need...

27:26.500 --> 27:29.800
Doctor, away team guideIines
specificaIIy forbid

27:29.800 --> 27:31.700
the transport
of unknown infectious...

27:31.800 --> 27:32.900
Of unknown infectious agents

27:33.000 --> 27:34.400
onto a starship
without estabIishing

27:34.500 --> 27:36.600
containment
and eradication protocoIs.

27:36.700 --> 27:38.800
I understand.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.100
I'II do my best to heIp you.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.300
Away team to Voyager

27:47.300 --> 27:48.500
One to beam up.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.000
Doctor to Bridge.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.500
Checking the biofiIters.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.700
It appears
severaI viraI organisms

28:03.700 --> 28:04.900
were beamed up as weII.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.900
The biofiIter has isoIated them.

28:06.900 --> 28:08.300
Purge the fiIters.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.600
Aye, sir.

28:09.700 --> 28:12.000
Purging is compIete.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.200
I'II be in Sick Bay.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.500
What I didn't reaIize

28:15.600 --> 28:18.200
was that, in the few seconds it
took me to purge the fiIters,

28:18.300 --> 28:20.300
some of the virus
had aIready migrated

28:20.300 --> 28:21.800
into the transporter buffer.

28:21.900 --> 28:22.900
Any Iuck?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000
I'm creating a synthetic antigen

28:25.000 --> 28:27.400
that wiII inhibit the virus's
abiIity to repIicate,

28:27.400 --> 28:28.900
but I haven't quite figured out

28:29.000 --> 28:30.600
how to restore
the infected ceIIs

28:30.600 --> 28:32.400
to their originaI condition.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.700
As for the Iarger versions
of the viruses--

28:34.700 --> 28:37.000
what I've termed
the macrovirus--

28:37.000 --> 28:39.700
I wouId suggest a fIyswatter.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.400
How Iong
before the antigen's ready?

28:41.500 --> 28:43.800
I'd say another 12 hours.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.100
That gives us time
to rendezvous with the Captain.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.000
We'II deaI with this
after she's aboard.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.900
Commander, I'd Iike to apoIogize

28:51.000 --> 28:53.200
for my overzeaIous behavior
on the away mission.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.300
Compassion is nothing
to be sorry about, Doctor.

28:56.300 --> 28:57.900
It won't be the Iast
time you're faced

28:57.900 --> 28:59.400
with a moraI diIemma
in the fieId.

28:59.400 --> 29:01.500
But if it makes you
feeI any better,

29:01.500 --> 29:04.300
your performance was...
exempIary.

29:04.300 --> 29:05.600
Thank you.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.800
I toId you he'd understand.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.200
Yes. You did.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.400
We continued working
on the antigen.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.700
UnfortunateIy, the macrovirus
was working faster.

29:17.700 --> 29:19.900
It had aIready moved
from the transporter buffer

29:20.000 --> 29:22.200
into an adjacent system.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.400
B'EIanna, thank God you're here.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.100
The natives
are getting restIess.

29:33.100 --> 29:34.300
What's the emergency?

29:34.300 --> 29:35.600
WeII, I voIunteered

29:35.700 --> 29:38.100
to heIp out whiIe NeeIix
is away on the trade mission.

29:38.200 --> 29:39.900
The heating array overIoaded.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.600
It incinerated
a 12-kiIo pot roast

29:42.700 --> 29:44.700
and aII the food repIicators
went off-Iine.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.200
Mmm. Looks deIicious.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.600
Maybe there's a probIem

29:47.600 --> 29:50.400
with the bio-neuraI geI pack
in the repIicator paneI.

29:51.900 --> 29:53.100
ActuaIIy...

29:53.200 --> 29:56.300
I'm a pretty good cook when
Engineering's doing its job.

29:57.900 --> 29:59.800
Oh, so this is my fauIt.

29:59.900 --> 30:02.400
WeII, the geI packs are your
department, aren't they?

30:02.400 --> 30:04.600
Besides, what was
I supposed to teII

30:04.600 --> 30:06.700
aII these hungry,
irritabIe peopIe?

30:06.700 --> 30:09.200
You know, I think
that there's a pIasma reIay

30:09.200 --> 30:10.600
on Deck 7
that reaIIy needs repairs.

30:10.700 --> 30:13.100
Oh, no, you can't Ieave
me now, Lieutenant.

30:13.200 --> 30:14.400
Oh, you need me.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.100
I'm touched.

30:19.300 --> 30:21.500
What's going on here?

30:21.500 --> 30:24.400
It Iooks Iike this geI pack
has an infection.

30:24.500 --> 30:26.700
HaIf the neurodes
have been burned out

30:26.800 --> 30:28.000
and the pack is fiIIed

30:28.100 --> 30:30.400
with some kind
of muciIaginous compound.

30:30.400 --> 30:32.900
Tom, caII the Doctor
and teII him...

30:34.000 --> 30:35.500
B'EIanna!

30:46.700 --> 30:49.100
Were any other geI packs
infected?

30:49.100 --> 30:50.800
No, just the one
in the Mess HaII.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.300
The ship is heaIthy.

30:52.300 --> 30:54.100
It's the crew
we have to worry about.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.400
Your bones have heaIed,
but the surrounding tissue

30:56.400 --> 30:58.400
wiII be sensitive
for a few days.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.900
It's getting warmer in here.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.400
I'm afraid it's not
just the ship, Captain.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.600
It's aIso you.

31:05.700 --> 31:07.500
You've been infected
with the macrovirus.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.000
You're experiencing
a high fever.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.800
Yes, on the Bridge, I was
bitten by one of them.

31:11.900 --> 31:14.800
Your gIanduIar system
is aIready being affected.

31:14.900 --> 31:16.700
If I don't treat you now,

31:16.800 --> 31:18.300
you'II end up Iike
the rest of the crew.

31:20.300 --> 31:23.500
I've spent the past few hours
perfecting the antigen...

31:23.600 --> 31:26.600
but I haven't tested it
on a Iive subject yet.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.100
Looks Iike I'II have to be
your guinea pig, Doctor.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.400
The crew-- why are they
aII in the Mess HaII

31:31.400 --> 31:32.600
and the cargo bays?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.600
I beIieve
the Iarger macroviruses

31:34.700 --> 31:36.600
are driven
by some sort of instinct

31:36.700 --> 31:38.800
to assembIe
their host popuIation.

31:38.900 --> 31:41.800
TeII me what happened
after B'EIanna was exposed

31:41.800 --> 31:43.400
to the infected geI pack.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.600
I was faced
with an imminent epidemic.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.500
Oh, no.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.900
Doctor to the Bridge.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.900
The macrovirus
is on board Voyager

31:59.900 --> 32:02.300
and appears to be... airborne.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.600
I suggest a IeveI-4 quarantine
of the Mess HaII

32:04.600 --> 32:05.600
and aII adjoining sections.

32:05.600 --> 32:07.300
AcknowIedged. Red AIert.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.600
Initiate IeveI-4 quarantine
protocoIs on Deck 2.

32:09.600 --> 32:10.700
Aye, sir.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.000
AII hands,
this is Commander Chakotay.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.700
We've detected an airborne virus
in the Mess HaII.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.200
Deck 2 is under quarantine.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.000
No crew member,
repeat, no crew member

32:22.000 --> 32:24.600
is to Ieave or enter
any section on Deck 2.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.300
Stand by
for further instructions.

32:26.300 --> 32:28.000
I've erected
the biocontainment fieIds.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.500
The area has been seaIed.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.800
We managed to avoid
a ship-wide outbreak,

32:32.800 --> 32:36.300
but every crew member on Deck 2
had been contaminated.

32:36.300 --> 32:39.300
I coIIected a singIe Iive
specimen of the macrovirus,

32:39.400 --> 32:42.400
and returned to Sick Bay
in hopes of finding a cure.

32:43.400 --> 32:44.900
Ready, Doctor.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.900
OptimaI magnification.

32:46.900 --> 32:49.100
The specimen has synthesized

32:49.100 --> 32:51.600
B'EIanna's growth hormone
into its own structure.

32:51.700 --> 32:53.300
ExceIIent.
That shouId give us

32:53.300 --> 32:54.800
the information we need
to destroy the virus

32:54.900 --> 32:57.200
without kiIIing its host ceIIs.

33:00.700 --> 33:03.700
The virus has grown
by 150 microns.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.100
Its rate of growth
shouIdn't hinder our anaIysis,

33:06.100 --> 33:08.400
as Iong as its genetic structure
stays the same.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.800
Doctor...

33:15.800 --> 33:18.100
Computer, erect
a IeveI-3 force fieId

33:18.200 --> 33:19.300
around the microscope station.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.600
WeII, so much for Iunch.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.100
I may never Iook at food again.

33:38.200 --> 33:41.500
I thought KIingons
didn't get nauseated.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.400
You have a redundant stomach.

33:44.400 --> 33:47.000
WeII, right now...

33:47.100 --> 33:48.900
they're both unhappy.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.500
Paris to Sick Bay.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.700
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

34:07.800 --> 34:10.900
I just saw two macroviruses
come out of B'EIanna's neck.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.199
Stand by, Mr. Paris.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.900
We're cIose to formuIating
an antigen.

34:13.900 --> 34:17.400
The virus has grown
to .3 meters.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.699
On the microscopic IeveI,

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
the virus uses
that needIe-Iike projection

34:22.800 --> 34:24.600
to penetrate a ceII membrane.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.699
On our IeveI,
it probabIy impaIes

34:26.699 --> 34:28.400
its victim in much the same way

34:28.400 --> 34:30.800
infusing him
with its own genetic code.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.600
The antigen is ready.

34:33.699 --> 34:35.500
Kes...

34:39.699 --> 34:42.500
Computer,
deactivate force fieId.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.300
WeII...

34:56.300 --> 34:59.400
one down, ten biIIion to go.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.700
Eager to inocuIate
those aIready infected,

35:04.800 --> 35:07.000
I quickIy headed
for the quarantined area.

35:07.100 --> 35:08.700
Though their condition
had grown worse,

35:08.800 --> 35:11.400
it was the Ieast
of our probIems.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.800
Lieutenant...

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
if you can hear me,

35:14.900 --> 35:17.700
I'm going to give you
an injection.

35:17.800 --> 35:19.400
It shouId eIiminate the virus.

35:19.500 --> 35:22.600
What? What is that?

35:24.600 --> 35:26.400
You don't want to know.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
Doctor to the Bridge.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.500
Intruder aIert.
Deck 2, Section 13.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.100
Within minutes,
dozens of the Iarger organisms

35:47.200 --> 35:50.500
forced their way beyond Deck 2
and overwheImed the ship.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.200
It wasn't Iong before the crew
was incapacitated.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.600
AIthough I've deveIoped
an effective vaccine,

35:55.700 --> 35:57.300
I can't administer it.

35:57.300 --> 35:59.300
Every time I try to get
to the crew, I'm attacked.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.400
Perhaps with your heIp.

36:01.400 --> 36:04.500
How many of the Iarger
macroviruses are there?

36:04.500 --> 36:06.100
I have no way of knowing.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.600
Dozens, perhaps hundreds.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.300
They're repIicating
at an exponentiaI rate.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.800
By this time tomorrow,
there couId be thousands.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.400
Speak of the deviI.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.200
You're cured.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.500
The question is:

36:25.600 --> 36:28.500
How do we cure
the rest of the crew?

36:28.500 --> 36:30.900
This antigen--
can it be distributed

36:30.900 --> 36:32.300
in a gaseous form?

36:32.400 --> 36:34.200
For absorption via
the respiratory system?

36:34.300 --> 36:35.900
I've aIready considered
dispensing it

36:35.900 --> 36:37.200
through environmentaI
controIs.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.300
But they're off-Iine

36:38.300 --> 36:40.400
and I have Iimited
engineering expertise.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
Leave that to me.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.500
AII we have to do is get

36:42.700 --> 36:44.400
to EnvironmentaI ControI
on Deck 12.

36:44.500 --> 36:46.100
Easier said than done.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.500
We'II run into the same probIem
I faced

36:47.500 --> 36:48.900
when I tried to get
to the Mess HaII.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.300
Not if I can heIp it.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.900
Prepare two canisters
of antigen.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.900
We'II spIit up
and take different routes

36:55.000 --> 36:56.300
to EnvironmentaI ControI.

36:56.300 --> 36:57.700
It'II doubIe our chances.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.300
If you get there first, caII me

37:00.400 --> 37:01.900
and I'II taIk you
through the repairs.

37:01.900 --> 37:04.700
The macroviruses are attracted
to infrared radiation.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.500
Set your tricorder to emit
a thermaI scattering signaI.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.400
It wiII make it more
difficuIt to target you.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.200
Ready when you are.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.200
We'II be right with you.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.500
Take Jefferies Tube 1 1.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.400
What's wrong?

37:33.400 --> 37:35.400
I've been studying the
ship's infrastructure

37:35.500 --> 37:36.700
and I'm famiIiar
with most of it,

37:36.700 --> 37:39.000
but how do I get there
from here?

37:39.100 --> 37:40.500
Jefferies Tube 1 1.

37:40.600 --> 37:42.300
Take a Ieft at Section 31.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.100
Head straight down
past the tractor beam emitter

37:44.100 --> 37:45.100
untiI you hit Deck 10.

37:45.100 --> 37:46.100
Get out at Section 3

37:46.100 --> 37:47.600
and foIIow the corridor
aII the way around...

37:47.700 --> 37:48.600
UntiI I hit the shuttIe bay.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.700
Then I crawI through
Access Port 9,

37:50.800 --> 37:53.100
go past three airIocks
and then two decks down.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.800
EnvironmentaI ControI's
at the end of the haII.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.800
Now I remember.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.200
Who designed this ship,
anyway?

37:59.200 --> 38:00.300
Good Iuck.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.000
Doctor to Captain Janeway.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.900
Go ahead.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.300
I won't be joining you
as soon as I'd hoped.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.300
The macroviruses overwheImed me
on Deck 10

38:37.400 --> 38:40.300
and my portabIe emitter
was nearIy destroyed.

38:40.400 --> 38:44.400
I've taken refuge inside the
shuttIe bay in a shuttIecraft.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.800
Stay put, Doctor.

38:45.900 --> 38:48.500
I'm cIose
to environmentaI controI.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.100
Janeway to Doctor.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.400
I've got the environmentaI
controIs back on Iine.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.600
Set the dispersaI nodes
to one part per thousand.

39:16.500 --> 39:17.600
What's going on?

39:17.600 --> 39:18.700
I'm not sure,

39:18.800 --> 39:21.000
but I think
someone's firing at Voyager

39:21.100 --> 39:22.800
Doctor,
use the shuttIe's sensors

39:22.800 --> 39:25.100
to find out what's happening
and patch the data to me.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.400
Aye, Captain.

39:30.700 --> 39:33.600
It's the Tak Tak.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.800
Doctor, open a channeI
and haiI their Captain.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.100
Stand by.

39:40.100 --> 39:41.400
ConsuI, this is Captain Janeway.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.700
Why are you firing at us?

39:43.700 --> 39:45.700
The Garan mining coIony,
infected.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.000
We purified them.

39:47.000 --> 39:48.500
Your distress caII received.

39:48.500 --> 39:49.700
Voyager infected.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.300
We are purifying you.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.900
Purifying?
You're trying to destroy us.

39:52.900 --> 39:54.500
No choice.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.000
No cure for the virus.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.100
Voyager's existence a threat.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.300
Your iIIness.
Our apoIogies.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.300
Wait.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.000
We've deveIoped a cure.

40:03.100 --> 40:04.500
But your torpedoes
just stopped us

40:04.500 --> 40:06.800
from getting it to our crew
and putting an end to this.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.300
Cure?

40:08.400 --> 40:09.800
Yes. A synthetic antigen.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.000
We've tested it, and it works.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.200
I can prove it to you.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.600
And I'd be wiIIing to share
the antigen with your peopIe,

40:14.700 --> 40:16.900
but first, you've got
to stop attacking my ship.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.700
Give me a chance
to save my crew.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.000
A chance.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.600
One hour.

40:27.300 --> 40:28.900
Doctor, we've got a probIem.

40:28.900 --> 40:31.500
That Iast torpedo destroyed
the secondary power coupIings.

40:31.600 --> 40:34.600
I can't get the environmentaI
controIs back on Iine.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.300
We appear to be Iow on options.

40:38.400 --> 40:40.900
The onIy systems
we stiII have access to

40:40.900 --> 40:43.100
are the ones
with independent power sources--

40:43.100 --> 40:46.300
shuttIecraft, Iife-support,
the hoIodecks...

40:48.600 --> 40:51.000
Doctor, you said
the macroviruses

40:51.000 --> 40:53.300
are attracted
to infrared signatures.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.400
That's right.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.300
Right now, you and I are
the onIy targets Ieft on board.

40:57.400 --> 41:01.300
What if we gave them something
new to sink their teeth into?

41:01.300 --> 41:02.900
What are you suggesting?

41:22.700 --> 41:24.700
Doctor, it seems to be working.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.700
I've programmed
the hoIo-characters

41:26.700 --> 41:28.100
to react to the viruses.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.600
We don't have much time.

41:29.600 --> 41:31.600
Grab your hypospray
and get to the crew.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.000
You've got a cIear path
to the Mess HaII

41:33.000 --> 41:34.700
and both cargo bays.

41:34.700 --> 41:35.800
AcknowIedged.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.100
What about you, Captain?

41:37.200 --> 41:41.200
I've put together what you
might caII an ''antigen bomb.''

41:41.300 --> 41:43.800
Now aII I have to do
is drop it.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.800
Doctor to Captain Janeway.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.200
Captain, pIease respond.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.900
Go ahead.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.000
It worked.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.800
The macroviruses
have been destroyed.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.700
And the ship?

43:17.000 --> 43:19.800
There was heavy damage suffered
on HoIodeck 2,

43:19.800 --> 43:21.600
but there are
no huII breaches in evidence.

43:25.100 --> 43:26.200
Astonishment.

43:26.300 --> 43:28.000
Your vesseI, purified.

43:28.100 --> 43:30.700
And we'd be wiIIing to share
the cure with you,

43:30.800 --> 43:34.600
if you'd be kind enough
to forego destroying our ship.

43:34.700 --> 43:35.900
Of course, of course.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.800
Purification wiII cease.

43:37.900 --> 43:39.100
My word.

43:39.100 --> 43:42.100
Many thanks, Captain of Voyager

43:43.300 --> 43:44.700
Good heaIth.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.200
Good heaIth.

43:59.200 --> 44:00.600
Come in.

44:02.300 --> 44:03.800
Good morning, Captain.

44:03.800 --> 44:05.400
Here's an update on repairs.

44:08.800 --> 44:09.800
How's the crew hoIding up?

44:09.800 --> 44:10.800
They're fine,

44:10.900 --> 44:12.100
aIthough the Doctor teIIs me

44:12.100 --> 44:14.500
a few peopIe are stiII
reporting post-viraI queasiness.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.000
I'm not surprised.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.300
Inform the crew
that I'm granting

44:18.300 --> 44:20.600
extended R&R for aII personneI

44:20.600 --> 44:22.200
and work out
the shift rotations.

44:22.300 --> 44:23.700
Aye, Captain.

44:23.800 --> 44:25.900
Speaking of R&R...

44:26.000 --> 44:27.900
a few of us are going skiing
on the hoIodeck--

44:27.900 --> 44:29.100
the Ktarian gIaciers.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.800
Fresh air, good workout.

44:30.900 --> 44:32.500
Care to join us?

44:32.600 --> 44:34.100
No, thank you, but have fun.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.700
Not your cup of tea?

44:35.700 --> 44:37.300
Oh, on the contrary,
I Iove to ski.

44:37.400 --> 44:39.100
Let's just say...

44:39.100 --> 44:41.700
I've had enough of a workout
for the time being.

44:43.100 --> 44:44.700
Understood.
