under his pillow.

There was no pill for his sickness.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.453
No medicine to ease his mind.

00:39.915 --> 00:43.793
He left blood and sweat
and part of his soul in a foreign land.

00:44.837 --> 00:47.588
My father never talked to me
about the war he fought.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.298
He never talked to anyone.

Ever vigilant. Ever silent.

Friend or foe?

-Don't know.
-Skynet doesn't have friends.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.206
Well, it's got foes. And whatever
the opposite of foes are, okay?

01:22.374 --> 01:24.375
-Friends.
-We don't know anything here.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.586
All we know is his name's on the list.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.214
Everyone we found on the list was
a Skynet target and needed protecting.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.383
Not everyone needs protecting.

Quarter inch to the left.

He. Leo.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.195
He had some issues
during my divorce.

03:16.697 --> 03:19.031
Some days I wanted to kill him.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.325
But we went to someone.

a little about yourself.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.348
Well, I've been a family counselor
for 20 years.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.768
I started my work

I've treated civilians almost exclusively.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.577
He wanted computer equipment.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.583
JOHN:
He tied us up.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.252
BOYD:
What happened next?

36:58.091 --> 36:59.800
Nothing.

37:02.971 --> 37:04.805
Nothing happened.

37:08.184 --> 37:10.978
The guy got what he wanted,
and he let us go.

37:11.438 --> 37:13.147
You know...

37:14.316 --> 37:18.485
...John, sometimes children feel
like they need to...

37:19.613 --> 37:21.614
...protect their parents.

37:21.781 --> 37:24.074
But that's not your job.

37:29.205 --> 37:30.998
You're not one of my vets.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.666
Your not a--

37:32.834 --> 37:34.877
You're not a soldier.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.838
You get to be a kid.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.636
No.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.247
[DING]

38:15.210 --> 38:17.711
WOMAN:
I know the records are in there.

38:17.921 --> 38:21.882
MAN: No, you don't. It's a waste of time.
WOMAN: It's not a waste of time.

38:33.520 --> 38:46.907
[DING]

39:23.403 --> 39:24.778
It was here for Dr. Sherman.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.406
-It was there to kill him.
-Or protect him.

39:27.615 --> 39:30.951
Whatever Sherman is or isn't supposed
to do, he's gonna live to do it.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.119
For now.

39:33.788 --> 39:37.249
I guess we're not gonna get any
answers from this. What'd you do to it?

39:37.417 --> 39:38.959
CAMERON:
Nothing.

39:39.127 --> 39:41.712
Once I accessed the CPU,
the chip destroyed itself.

39:42.422 --> 39:46.341
-This model has been redesigned.
-With a self-destruct feature?

39:50.805 --> 39:54.016
Skynet must not want me
reprogramming in the future.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.227
-This is one way to stop you.
JOHN: I guess they're getting smarter.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.645
We should too.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.154
Time's up, Savannah.

40:07.947 --> 40:09.490
See you next week.

40:09.657 --> 40:13.952
Could you play for a minute, Savannah?
I'd like to speak with the doctor.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.498
I'm very impressed with your work.

40:18.124 --> 40:23.170
Oh, well, you've done
some good work too, Ms. Weaver.

40:26.466 --> 40:28.383
Savannah seems happier.

40:29.177 --> 40:32.554
I gather you've worked hard to show her
the mother she knew...

40:32.764 --> 40:34.348
...before her father's death.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.519
I have, yes. But I wasn't speaking
of your work with Savannah.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.356
I meant the insight you had
into my project.

40:42.524 --> 40:44.983
I could use someone with your instincts
on my team.

40:46.027 --> 40:52.282
I'm-- I'm flattered, but I do have
a responsibility to my patients.

40:54.369 --> 40:56.537
As a consultant, then.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.540
You compared the AI to a child.

40:59.707 --> 41:00.707
Help me raise it.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.837
Well, you realize you're talking to a man
who doesn't even know...

41:05.004 --> 41:06.880
...how to run his own lawn mower.

41:07.048 --> 41:11.802
Just treat it like one of your patients.
You'll do quite well.

41:16.057 --> 41:20.561
When I was a child, I did my sums
on rolls of butcher paper.

41:20.937 --> 41:24.231
My father would bring them home
from work.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.900
I liked the way the paper smelled.

41:28.236 --> 41:30.737
That's my most vivid memory
from childhood.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.698
What did the paper smell like?

41:32.866 --> 41:34.408
Cow's blood.

41:43.960 --> 41:48.213
SARAH: In 1678, doctors diagnosed the
mental affliction soldiers suffered from...

41:48.381 --> 41:50.757
...as nostalgia.

41:56.055 --> 41:57.472
Homesickness.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.475
A longing to return to the past.

42:01.853 --> 42:05.898
The cruel reality of war is
that there is no return home.

42:06.399 --> 42:08.942
No return to innocence.

42:12.488 --> 42:15.282
What is lost, is lost forever.

42:18.077 --> 42:22.623
Like my father,
war's wounds have bled me dry.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.628
No words of comfort.

42:32.967 --> 42:35.469
No words of forgiveness.

42:40.642 --> 42:42.643
No words at all.

42:47.273 --> 42:50.484
I have to say, I was surprised
when you called.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.821
Why don't you start by telling me
why you're here?

42:56.866 --> 42:59.368
[GRUNTING]

43:04.999 --> 43:06.375
[CRUNCH]
