00:01.066 --> 00:02.300
Can you please explain to me

00:02.367 --> 00:04.467
why we keep volunteering
for the dance committee

00:04.533 --> 00:06.867
when we know Kate's gonna be
put in charge?

00:06.934 --> 00:09.133
I don't know,
I'm just here for the free food.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.533
Gordo, there is no free food here.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.367
You're right. See ya!

-[WHOOSHES]
-[BOTH SCOFF]

00:20.400 --> 00:23.033
Well, I know that I'm here because
being on the dance committee,

00:23.100 --> 00:25.567
it gives us an excuse
to go to the dance without dates.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.233
Who says we can't get dates?

00:28.567 --> 00:31.500
Fine, just as long as we don't end up
on the clean-up crew again.

00:31.567 --> 00:32.700
Ugh.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.100
The problem isn't
that I don't have a date,

00:35.166 --> 00:37.533
it's just that Josh Hartnett
doesn't go to this school.

00:39.700 --> 00:44.300
Well, I'm sure you're all extremely
excited about the Spring Fling Dance.

00:45.033 --> 00:48.500
You know, putting together
a good dance committee is a...

00:48.567 --> 00:53.400
It's a delicate balance involving
matching personalities and abilities.

00:53.467 --> 00:54.433
However, I have a meeting.

00:54.500 --> 00:57.033
So, Kate, you're in charge
of the decorations.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.166
Miranda, you cover the food,

00:58.233 --> 01:00.767
and, you, kid with the face,
you handle the music.

01:00.834 --> 01:03.200
Naturally, he picked me
for the decorations.

01:03.266 --> 01:05.200
That's the most important part.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.266
[MOUTHING] "Most important part."

[MOCKING]
"That's the most important part."

01:10.767 --> 01:13.767
You know, you're right, Kate.
Decorations are a big deal.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.400
You and Lizzie are in charge.

01:16.767 --> 01:17.934
[CHUCKLES WRYLY]

the most important part.

[THEME SONG PLAYING]

02:02.567 --> 02:05.633
Mom, what do you think
about this table decoration?

02:05.700 --> 02:08.800
I think they'd better not be
from my garden.

02:08.867 --> 02:13.266
But, Mom, the Spring Fling decorations
are really, really important.

02:13.333 --> 02:14.367
I mean, if I bomb this,

02:14.433 --> 02:16.033
I'm gonna be known
as the girl who messed up

02:16.100 --> 02:17.100
the whole entire dance.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.000
And then, I'll end up a mathlete.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.500
Hey, I was a mathlete.

02:26.533 --> 02:28.033
Take all the flowers you need, honey.

02:28.100 --> 02:29.100
Thanks, Mom.

02:32.166 --> 02:34.233

02:34.300 --> 02:35.300
"Why are you mad at me?"

02:35.367 --> 02:38.467
And she was like,
"Because you never let me talk."

02:38.533 --> 02:42.734
You gotta admit, Lanny, you do tend
to dominate the conversation.

02:55.066 --> 02:58.100
The BMX Tornado Rider.

02:59.333 --> 03:03.934
You're right, Lanny.
It's bike time, big time.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.967
Okay, minor change to the dance theme.

03:09.066 --> 03:11.967
Instead of a Spring Fling,
it's Fashion Week in Paris.

03:12.033 --> 03:14.266
Uh, the school already voted, Kate.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.533
Uh, fine, we'll compromise.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.934
Springtime in Paris.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.300
I say we put
the Eiffel Towerover here,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.166
and people can enter
from over there

03:22.233 --> 03:24.800
under a huge canopy of yellow roses.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.000
No, pink.

03:26.066 --> 03:27.533
No, yellow.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.767
Uh, no, daisies.
Roses are so expensive.

03:30.834 --> 03:32.433
Think "Paris in the spring," Lizzie!

03:32.500 --> 03:34.433
Think "Let's stay on the budget,"
Kate.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.233
Think twice
before volunteering for anything.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.734
And we're gonna have
to get rid of Principal Baldy here.

standard to metric.

11:45.433 --> 11:46.467
But I had a reason.

11:46.533 --> 11:48.900
We have to wake up, people!
The metric system is here.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.567
This wasn't about the science lab
at all, was it?

11:53.633 --> 11:54.633
No.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.400
Oh...

11:57.600 --> 12:01.333
The statue of our first principal
has been defaced.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.900
Now, until whoever has committed this
act of vandalism comes forward,

12:08.533 --> 12:11.367
the Spring Fling Dance is canceled.

12:12.266 --> 12:13.266
That is all.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.133
I didn't even do anything.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.233
So why do I feel like I'm in so
much trouble?

12:20.800 --> 12:23.233
Maybe it's because I still have
a head in my backpack.

12:25.367 --> 12:27.066
So, when are you going to tell?

12:27.367 --> 12:28.367
Um...

12:28.433 --> 12:29.800
Lizzie, you can't tell.

12:29.867 --> 12:31.433
Well, uh...

12:31.900 --> 12:33.300
She has to tell,

12:33.367 --> 12:34.967
or else the
dance will be canceled,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.066
and Cody and I will never
have our moment.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.400
Well I was go...

12:38.467 --> 12:39.600
She can't tell.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.433
If she tells, everyone in school
will know that she's a fink.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.500
A fink?

12:44.000 --> 12:46.800
You know, a rat, a stool pigeon,
a snitch.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.934
Okay, she has to tell
because of Cody.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.400
You know? Cody? A hunk, a hottie,
a heartthrob.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.433
My first dance with an actual date.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.734
Whoo-hoo! Bike time!

12:57.800 --> 13:01.834
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Yeah!

13:02.233 --> 13:05.000
Anyway, you guys, thanks for talking
this over with me.

13:05.066 --> 13:06.533
It's helped a lot.

13:11.133 --> 13:14.967
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands

13:15.033 --> 13:18.800
together for the BMX Tornado Rider!

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Cool.

13:22.633 --> 13:24.033
Well, where's yours?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.867
We only had enough money for one,
so we're gonna share.

13:26.934 --> 13:30.200
Aw, that's so sweet.
They're gonna share.

13:30.266 --> 13:31.467
That's nice, kids.

13:36.233 --> 13:37.500
You think that's gonna work?

13:37.667 --> 13:40.066
Mmm, no. Not a chance.

13:44.633 --> 13:47.000
I could be wrong
about this, Lanny, but

13:47.066 --> 13:50.266
I believe we're two of the happiest
kids in the world.

13:52.166 --> 13:55.934
No, no, no, no, no, no, Lanny,
you first.

13:56.233 --> 13:58.400
No, Lanny, I insist.

13:58.467 --> 14:01.133
You go ahead. Head butt!

14:23.867 --> 14:29.266
Hmm... I would've thought having a
bike would be more... Fun.

14:40.900 --> 14:47.066
A rat, a stool pigeon, a fink.
A rat, a stool pigeon, a fink.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.900
My first dance with an actual date.

14:49.967 --> 14:54.533
An actual date, date, date. Tell!

14:54.600 --> 14:55.600
Don't tell.

14:55.667 --> 14:56.667
Tell!

14:56.734 --> 14:58.000
Don't tell.

14:58.066 --> 15:00.300
Stop telling her to tell.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.734
You keep out of this.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.300
I'm not keeping outta this.
You keep out o' this.

15:05.133 --> 15:08.500
-Ow! Cut that out.
-Ow! You cut that out.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.266
Hey, you kids, cut that out.

15:12.266 --> 15:14.633
I gotta stop eating
right before I go to bed.

15:27.767 --> 15:28.767
Don't do it!

15:39.734 --> 15:42.266
Oh! So, did you tell?

15:42.333 --> 15:43.667
Of course she didn't tell

15:43.734 --> 15:44.734
Actually...

15:45.567 --> 15:47.700
PRINCIPAL TWEEDY: <i>Will all students </i>
<i>please report to the gym </i>

15:47.767 --> 15:49.867
<i>for an emergency assembly.</i>

15:49.934 --> 15:51.934
I hope I did the right thing.

15:58.166 --> 16:02.567
It gives me great pleasure to
announce the Spring Dance is back on!

16:04.000 --> 16:08.200
The person responsible for damaging
the statue has been identified.

16:13.166 --> 16:16.367
Apparently, looks can't kill,
because I'm still alive.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.300
Lizzie McGuire has confessed

16:19.367 --> 16:23.834
to beheading the statue of my friend
and mentor, Walter Patterson.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.700
I knew she did it. I just didn't
wanna tell on her.

16:27.767 --> 16:31.400
Of course, Miss McGuire will not be
permitted to attend the dance.

16:33.934 --> 16:34.934
Hey, Lizzie,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.433
why'd you knock the head off that,
"Hey, you kids, cut that out" guy?

16:38.500 --> 16:40.433
She didn't do it, Ethan.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.233
She wanted
everyone to go to the dance,

16:43.433 --> 16:46.734
so she said she did it,
even though she didn't.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.100
The kids are really quiet tonight.

16:58.567 --> 16:59.567
It's kinda nice.

17:00.667 --> 17:04.200
No, Sam, it's not.
Something's wrong with them.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
They're not fighting.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.934
All right, we'll be good parents
and we'll talk to 'em.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Who first?

17:13.633 --> 17:14.633
Matt'll be easier.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.900
-Good thinking.
-Yep.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.100
Hey, Matt, honey,
is everything okay?

17:21.166 --> 17:23.000
Yeah, just fine.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.567
Bike workin' out all right?

17:25.900 --> 17:28.033
Yeah, the bike's great.

17:28.467 --> 17:30.133
You guys sharin' okay?

17:30.333 --> 17:32.033
The sharing's fine. I mean,

17:32.100 --> 17:36.000
Lanny goes and rides the bike,
then I go ride the bike.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.633
Well, what's the problem, then?

17:39.266 --> 17:43.667
The problem? The problem is,
there's no "we" in "bike."

17:44.433 --> 17:45.433
I miss Lanny.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.667
Well, I can't speak for Lanny.

17:49.734 --> 17:50.734
Somebody's got to.

17:52.200 --> 17:56.367
But I bet he feels exactly
the same way you do.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.467
Why don't you give him a call?

18:04.934 --> 18:07.834
Hello, Lanny?
Don't say anything.

18:07.900 --> 18:09.433
I wanna talk.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.633
This bike thing was a stupid idea.

18:11.700 --> 18:14.900
We had more fun earning it
than we do having it.

18:15.834 --> 18:19.000
What's the point of being friends
if we're never in the same room?

18:19.767 --> 18:22.433
Uh-huh. Yeah.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.734
You are so right.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.900
You've got such a way with
words, Lanny.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.800
So, we're agreed.

18:29.867 --> 18:33.533
We sell the bike and we use the money
to go into the ostrich business.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.467
See you soon.

18:37.066 --> 18:40.166
Dad, could you give me a
ride to Lanny's?

18:40.233 --> 18:44.266
And, I'm gonna need you to clean
out the tool shed.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.900
I knew we shoulda
started with her.

18:54.533 --> 18:56.800
Hey, what's wrong, sweetie?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.200
Mom...

19:02.567 --> 19:03.700
I don't know.

19:03.767 --> 19:07.233
I just wanted to decorate the dance
so maybe I could become popular,

19:07.934 --> 19:10.533
and then Kate had to go
and break the statue head,

19:10.567 --> 19:14.033
and I really didn't
wanna go to Canada, and so then

19:14.100 --> 19:16.734
we tried to chew gum and stick the
head back together,

19:16.800 --> 19:18.066
and it kept falling apart,

19:18.133 --> 19:19.567
and then...

19:19.633 --> 19:20.967
I don't know, the only way that

19:21.033 --> 19:22.900
Miranda could go out with Cody Pierson

19:22.967 --> 19:25.767
is if I took the blame
for it, so then, I did,

19:25.834 --> 19:29.433
and now, everyone's at the dance
having a good time except for me.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.734
And I'm stuck here all by myself.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.567
Oh, well,

19:34.066 --> 19:36.934
let's just try to sort this out
one piece at a time.

19:37.934 --> 19:42.734
There's a statue, and, uh, you...
Canada...

19:43.367 --> 19:44.767
Who's Cody Pierson?

19:45.667 --> 19:46.667
Oh...

19:46.734 --> 19:48.467
Okay, lemme, uh, see who that is, and

19:48.533 --> 19:49.967
then we'll keep workin' on this, okay?

19:50.033 --> 19:51.767
-Mmm-hmm.
-Mmm.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.834
Lizzie, there's someone here
to see you.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.333
Hey.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.333
Hey. I thought you were gonna
be at the dance.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.834
Well, my best friend wasn't gonna
be there, so, why would I wanna go?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.867
Besides, I brought you mini-donuts.

20:14.166 --> 20:15.166
Thanks.

20:15.567 --> 20:16.900
Oh, hey, guys!

20:18.333 --> 20:19.333
Hey.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.300
Oh, hey, Cody.

20:25.467 --> 20:26.467
Got it!

20:26.533 --> 20:28.166
Did you guys tell more
people to come?

20:29.033 --> 20:30.033
Uh, no?

20:30.100 --> 20:32.734
Hail, my fair maiden.
We come bearing libations.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.633
Yeah, what he said.

20:34.700 --> 20:35.767
Huh?

20:36.533 --> 20:38.367
Aren't you guys supposed to be
at the dance?

20:38.433 --> 20:40.567
Oh, Lizzie, Lizzie, Lizzie,

20:40.633 --> 20:44.266
since you couldn't come to the party,
the party's comin' to you.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.667
I don't know what to say.

20:47.734 --> 20:48.900
You don't gotta say anything.

20:48.967 --> 20:51.734
Just, uh, show us where the stereo
is and I'll crank some tunes.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.033
Oh, I'll show you. I'll show you where
the music is, I'll show you.

20:54.100 --> 20:56.433
-Thanks, Mom.
-SAM: I got it!

21:02.033 --> 21:05.867
You guys, I have two of the best
friends in the whole entire world.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.600
You know, Gordo and I were
just saying the same.

21:15.467 --> 21:17.000
Where is everybody?

21:18.567 --> 21:20.500
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING]

21:28.600 --> 21:30.100
Mom, the Spling Fring...

21:30.800 --> 21:32.100
The Spling Fring...

21:32.166 --> 21:34.800
Mom, the Spling Fling decorations
are really...

21:36.433 --> 21:37.567
Ask. A...

21:39.000 --> 21:42.200
For the BD... That's not it.

21:42.266 --> 21:44.633
Decorations are the most
important part.

21:44.700 --> 21:47.333
Until, uh... Then the heat went...
Mmm...

21:47.400 --> 21:48.734
And get you a job as a lum...

21:49.800 --> 21:51.900
We smuggle you into Canada...

21:54.100 --> 21:55.767
He wasn't even looking at us.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.967
I have the two... What is it?

21:59.533 --> 22:01.433
Two of the bestest friends.
