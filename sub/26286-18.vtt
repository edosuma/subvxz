00:00.188 --> 00:01.822
Previously on This Is Us...

00:01.923 --> 00:03.750
Our kid is 12 weeks early.

00:03.820 --> 00:05.070
Two and a half pounds.

00:05.095 --> 00:07.492
He's hooked up
to all those IVs and machines.

00:07.593 --> 00:09.187
We've actually... we've been thinking

00:09.212 --> 00:11.835
about relocating... out to California.

00:11.938 --> 00:14.531
You know, to be there for Kate,
to help out with the baby.

00:14.864 --> 00:17.257
Kevin, if having kids is
something you need

00:17.282 --> 00:20.046
to make your life complete,
you have to tell me.

00:20.262 --> 00:22.343
If I have to choose
between a life with you

00:22.489 --> 00:24.601
and a life with kids, it's no contest.

00:24.646 --> 00:25.789
I choose you.

00:26.047 --> 00:28.960
For the past 20 years
I have stood by your side

00:28.985 --> 00:30.519
through every flight of fancy,

00:30.544 --> 00:32.609
and for the first time...
the first time...

00:32.723 --> 00:34.257
I have a flight of fancy,

00:34.282 --> 00:36.726
and I am not going to give that up.

00:37.214 --> 00:38.867
I am not going to bend.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.274
It's time to go see her, Tess.

00:41.366 --> 00:42.445
I'm not ready.

00:42.470 --> 00:43.953
Oh, did you bring the
Pin the Tail on the Donkey

00:43.978 --> 00:45.898
from my office? Thank you.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.200
I promised I'd bring it.

00:47.271 --> 00:49.046
We're all going to see Randall's mother.

Hey, come on, girls,
let's make breakfast.

01:56.767 --> 01:59.914
There's my big, strong two-week-old.

02:00.193 --> 02:02.595
Oh, you're doing so good, Jack.

02:02.620 --> 02:04.570
So well, doing so well.

02:04.710 --> 02:05.976
He's young and impressionable.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.534
- Don't.
- Good morning.

02:07.734 --> 02:09.132
I brought some coffee.

02:09.273 --> 02:10.972
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.078
Yours is decaf,
'cause I didn't think that

02:13.103 --> 02:15.921
little Jack should have any
caffeine in his breast milk.

02:16.964 --> 02:19.523
Well, the doctor said it's fine,
as long as I time the caffeine

02:19.548 --> 02:21.115
between feedings.

02:21.245 --> 02:23.132
- Well, better safe than sorry.
- Mm-hmm.

02:23.219 --> 02:24.625
Did I show you this apartment

02:24.650 --> 02:26.070
that Miguel is seeing for us today?

02:26.095 --> 02:27.628
- Look at those Spanish tiles.
- Yeah.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.742
I think we're really gonna
love living out here.

02:29.767 --> 02:31.585
And we love that you're moving out here.

02:32.097 --> 02:33.531
Do we really have to do it this way?

02:33.556 --> 02:35.585
I mean, this just takes forever.

02:35.610 --> 02:39.148
Yeah, but you actually get
to taste the coffee this way.

02:40.043 --> 02:41.921
Yeah. Here, try it.

02:46.140 --> 02:50.546
Mmm... Oh, my gosh!
It-it tastes like coffee.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.601
- Shut up. You know it tastes better.
- It does.

02:52.626 --> 02:54.710
See, this is what I want
right here, you know.

02:54.735 --> 02:56.969
I mean, who could spend 20 minutes doing

02:56.994 --> 02:59.171
pour-over coffee if there was
a screaming baby in the house?

02:59.196 --> 03:00.265
Right?

03:01.485 --> 03:02.885
You want to talk about it some more?

03:02.958 --> 03:05.242
No. No, I'm... look, I'm kidding.

03:05.267 --> 03:06.421
I'm kidding.

03:06.554 --> 03:08.255
Total ki... get over here. Come here.

03:08.413 --> 03:10.437
I want to see if pour-over coffee breath

03:10.462 --> 03:12.273
- is better than regular coffee breath.
- Okay.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.125
Oh, shoot.

03:38.564 --> 03:39.687
Hello.

03:49.098 --> 03:53.703
synced and corrected by susinz
*www.addic7ed.com*

03:57.750 --> 03:59.476
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

03:59.501 --> 04:00.921
I came as soon as I could.

04:00.946 --> 04:02.828
- Miguel's picking up the kids.
- It's okay.

04:02.853 --> 04:04.187
- I'm fine.
- Mm.

04:05.282 --> 04:07.016
My arm really hurts, though.

04:07.392 --> 04:09.539
Mm, but they gave me stuff for it.

04:09.702 --> 04:11.546
I'm on so many pain meds,

04:11.571 --> 04:13.210
I feel really loopy.

04:14.211 --> 04:16.289
- Hmm.
- Okay.

04:16.314 --> 04:19.209
Jack, I just looked down for one second

04:19.375 --> 04:22.351
'cause Kate wanted peaches
and the peaches fell out

04:22.376 --> 04:23.765
- of the bag.
- Hey, hey, it's okay.

04:23.874 --> 04:24.968
Doesn't matter.

04:26.770 --> 04:28.000
What did the doctor say?

04:28.272 --> 04:29.367
Mm...

04:29.392 --> 04:32.859
he said I broke my arm in two places.

04:33.226 --> 04:35.835
Mm. My MRI looked good.

04:37.022 --> 04:39.234
But he wants to keep me overnight

04:39.837 --> 04:42.664
to, you know, monitor me

04:42.689 --> 04:45.226
and just be extra cautious.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.273
All right, little man.

04:50.298 --> 04:53.501
Let's see if you can
breathe on your own.

04:54.637 --> 04:56.872
Come on, buddy, come on, buddy.

04:57.312 --> 04:58.507
Come on.

05:02.367 --> 05:03.476
He's doing it.

05:05.168 --> 05:07.235
Yeah, blood oxygen levels are steady.

05:07.260 --> 05:09.929
His lungs are functioning well
without the ventilator.

05:10.459 --> 05:13.632
What you are looking at
is some top-notch breathing.

05:13.657 --> 05:14.921
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God. I've never been

05:14.946 --> 05:16.859
so proud of somebody
for doing something so basic.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.773
This is great.

05:18.836 --> 05:20.312
This is great, this is exactly what

05:20.337 --> 05:22.789
we want to see
at 30 weeks developmentally.

05:23.119 --> 05:25.515
Now, Jack is still very new at this,

05:25.540 --> 05:28.046
which means that we all
have to monitor him closely.

05:28.571 --> 05:30.257
So let's go over how we do that.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.507
Oh, hold on one second.

05:32.562 --> 05:34.281
I just... want to...

05:36.040 --> 05:37.914
peanuts from the plane...

05:37.939 --> 05:39.023
I know it's in here somewhere.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.140
I have a little notebook.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.906
Here we go. Sorry, sorry.

05:41.931 --> 05:44.312
I just don't want to forget anything.

05:44.422 --> 05:46.929
All right, when it
comes to Baby Jack's breathing,

05:46.977 --> 05:49.789
it's all about minding our As and Bs.

05:49.814 --> 05:51.585
"A" stands for apnea,

05:51.768 --> 05:53.718
"B" stands for bradycardia.

05:53.935 --> 05:56.296
And how do you spell that last word?

05:56.739 --> 05:58.195
- Brady...
- Mom?

05:58.277 --> 06:00.304
Dr. Green could get
called away at any second,

06:00.329 --> 06:01.640
so I think that we should just

06:01.665 --> 06:03.703
keep the questions and maybe
the spell-check until the end.

06:03.816 --> 06:04.929
- Okay.
- All right.

06:04.954 --> 06:07.960
Breathing doesn't come naturally
to Jack just yet.

06:07.985 --> 06:10.382
He needs to remember to do it, okay?

06:10.407 --> 06:11.641
And sometimes he'll forget.

06:11.666 --> 06:13.166
Now, when he does forget,

06:13.323 --> 06:15.007
that's called apnea.

06:15.053 --> 06:17.593
Which leads to bradycardia,
or "bradying,"

06:17.789 --> 06:19.957
or an extremely low heart rate.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.539
- Jesus.
- No, I know it sounds scary.

06:22.827 --> 06:24.394
And when that happens, you're gonna hear

06:24.419 --> 06:26.453
all sorts of beeping and alarms,

06:26.478 --> 06:28.484
which can make it even scarier.

06:28.509 --> 06:30.765
But there's actually
a very simple solution

06:30.953 --> 06:32.562
when that happens... just...

06:35.186 --> 06:36.343
give him a little tap.

06:36.368 --> 06:38.523
- Tap.
- Okay? It startles him

06:38.548 --> 06:41.757
just a little to remind him to breathe.

06:41.797 --> 06:44.171
Will the nurses respond
if he stops breathing, though?

06:44.196 --> 06:45.203
Oh, yeah. Yeah,

06:45.228 --> 06:46.804
- a nurse will be here immediately.
- Okay.

06:46.829 --> 06:48.414
- But if you're sitting here...
- Mm-hmm.

06:48.489 --> 06:49.984
...just go ahead and tap him yourself.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.390
- Okay, and what about...?
- Is it dangerous

06:52.415 --> 06:55.148
for him if he starts to bray...

06:55.173 --> 06:56.398
- Bradying.
- Bradying. Brady.

06:56.423 --> 06:57.546
No. No, not at all.

06:57.571 --> 06:59.921
- Not if he's dealt with swiftly.
- Hmm.

07:00.978 --> 07:02.648
- Okay, so does it matter...
- You know what?

07:02.673 --> 07:04.132
I got to go, um...

07:04.486 --> 07:06.625
but we will talk later. This is good.

07:06.650 --> 07:07.851
This is very good.

07:09.264 --> 07:10.468
I...

07:12.569 --> 07:13.695
Siri,

07:13.720 --> 07:16.156
how do you spell "bradycardia"?

07:27.756 --> 07:29.171
- Hello?
- Dad.

07:29.196 --> 07:31.593
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, there's my Fab Four.

07:32.844 --> 07:34.820
Hey, Dej, we should probably
hit the road soon if we're gonna

07:34.845 --> 07:36.671
make it to your debate
tournament in Newark.

07:37.710 --> 07:39.296
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:42.523 --> 07:43.851
Uh, I have back-to-back

07:43.876 --> 07:45.921
beginner's ballet classes,
so Zoe and Kevin

07:45.946 --> 07:47.718
are gonna come watch
the girls while I'm gone.

07:47.828 --> 07:50.359
- Great.
- Are you staying here tonight

07:50.384 --> 07:51.539
when you get back?

07:51.649 --> 07:54.882
Oh, I, um... maybe.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.093
Just waiting for Jae-Won
to tell me tomorrow's schedule.

07:57.968 --> 07:59.664
Hey, Dej, I'm gonna go get
your backpack.

08:00.371 --> 08:01.664
Okay.

08:12.928 --> 08:14.750
Did you know Deja joined
the debate team?

08:14.929 --> 08:16.179
It's news to me.

08:16.483 --> 08:18.117
Yesterday was the first I'd heard of it.

08:18.346 --> 08:19.413
Same.

08:22.931 --> 08:25.414
Randall, the other night
I-I said some things

08:25.439 --> 08:26.898
- that I didn't...
- No, we both did.

08:30.453 --> 08:33.241
Do you think we can talk
when Deja and I get back later?

08:33.488 --> 08:35.640
Figure out how we're gonna
make our way through this?

08:36.573 --> 08:37.726
Yeah.

08:42.610 --> 08:44.312
You remember, uh...

08:44.962 --> 08:48.015
few months back when we finally
did that escape room together?

08:48.835 --> 08:50.195
Oh, that was a disaster.

08:50.658 --> 08:53.187
Deja and Tess hated it,
Annie got claustrophobic.

08:53.212 --> 08:55.218
Yeah, but then... right before

08:55.243 --> 08:57.828
all three girls went
into full meltdown mode...

08:57.853 --> 08:59.179
We found the door.

09:00.039 --> 09:01.367
We found the door.

09:07.023 --> 09:09.203
I'm not seeing the door here, Randall.

09:22.859 --> 09:24.039
- Yeah.
- I want to give her the flowers.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.867
- You can give her the chocolates.
- No, Kev.

09:25.892 --> 09:28.639
Hey, guys. Hi.

09:30.367 --> 09:32.350
- Come on, come on inside.
- It looks worse

09:32.375 --> 09:33.859
- than it is.
- Come on.

09:35.156 --> 09:37.998
- Thank you so much for picking them up.
- Of course.

09:38.023 --> 09:39.593
- Hey, bud.
- Yeah. Let me know if you

09:39.618 --> 09:41.796
- need anything else, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, man.

09:41.937 --> 09:43.237
I'll give you guys some privacy.

09:45.195 --> 09:46.623
How are you guys?

09:46.648 --> 09:48.475
Your face looks really messed up.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.843
Kevin.

09:50.071 --> 09:51.570
That's okay.

09:52.085 --> 09:54.164
I bet it looks pretty messed up.

09:54.329 --> 09:55.343
Hmm.

09:55.368 --> 09:57.273
Nobody's given me a mirror,

09:57.298 --> 09:59.929
which is probably for the best.

10:00.084 --> 10:03.062
Mom, wh-why are you
talking like that, all slow?

10:03.929 --> 10:05.617
'Cause I'm on medicine, bud.

10:05.676 --> 10:07.382
Makes my arm not hurt,

10:07.407 --> 10:10.265
but it also makes me really sleepy.

10:12.996 --> 10:14.234
It's okay.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.023
Hey, guys, can you give me
a second to talk

10:21.048 --> 10:23.125
- to your dad alone, please?
- Go, uh, go wait outside.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.398
- Okay?
- Okay.

10:24.505 --> 10:25.812
- Okay.
- I love you guys.

10:25.837 --> 10:26.937
- Go ahead.
- Love you.

10:26.962 --> 10:28.203
I love you.

10:30.187 --> 10:32.054
Go ahead. I'll be right out.

10:34.847 --> 10:38.304
Jack, you got to take them home.

10:38.329 --> 10:39.523
They're really scared.

10:39.548 --> 10:42.031
No, come on, I'm-I'm not gonna
leave you here overnight.

10:42.056 --> 10:43.976
I... it's one night.

10:44.635 --> 10:45.781
Please.

10:46.888 --> 10:48.062
Okay.

10:49.537 --> 10:50.703
If that's what you want.

10:50.754 --> 10:52.109
Mm-hmm. It is.

11:05.368 --> 11:07.875
So... your first debate meet.

11:09.154 --> 11:11.125
Hey, how'd you get interested
in debate anyway?

11:11.695 --> 11:12.914
I don't know.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.544
Just happened, I guess.

11:16.731 --> 11:17.968
Hmm.

11:18.216 --> 11:19.687
When did you and Beth stop knowing

11:19.712 --> 11:21.406
how to have a conversation
with each other?

11:23.522 --> 11:25.189
- What are you ta...
- Randall.

11:25.668 --> 11:27.835
Come on, I know what it's like
to live in a house

11:27.860 --> 11:30.117
where people are pissed off
at each other all the time.

11:35.581 --> 11:37.164
Do the other girls feel it, too?

11:38.356 --> 11:40.156
Not Annie, she's too young,

11:40.181 --> 11:41.640
but Tess,

11:42.215 --> 11:43.593
she does for sure.

11:48.781 --> 11:49.898
Hello, hello, hello?

11:49.923 --> 11:52.726
Cool uncle and hot aunt in the hizzy!

11:52.751 --> 11:54.062
- Who's home? Anybody?
- Hi!

11:54.262 --> 11:55.500
- Hello?
- Hey.

11:55.525 --> 11:57.640
- Hey!
- Hey, guys. Thanks so much

11:57.665 --> 11:59.093
for coming to hang out
with the girls today.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.382
- Anytime. It'll be fun, right?
- I think so. Yeah.

12:01.407 --> 12:03.664
You know, I haven't seen you
since L.A. How have you been?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.976
Uh, I'm good, really good.
Thank you, yeah.

12:06.001 --> 12:07.257
And wildly sober, so you have

12:07.282 --> 12:08.648
- nothing to worry about...
- That's great, Kev. That's so good.

12:08.673 --> 12:10.593
Thank you, guys.
Thank you, guys, so much.

12:13.827 --> 12:15.257
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

12:15.282 --> 12:17.554
Uh, she typically has
at least one really mean

12:17.579 --> 12:19.847
- zinger for me.
- Hey, guys, I need your help.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.882
I have to pick an outfit
for yearbook photos.

12:21.938 --> 12:23.046
- Cool.
- Oh, I am all over it.

12:23.071 --> 12:24.078
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:24.103 --> 12:25.203
Can I come?

12:25.228 --> 12:27.496
Well, this is clearly
a two-person job, Annie.

12:27.521 --> 12:29.695
You simply must come. Ah.

12:30.968 --> 12:31.968
Have fun.

12:31.993 --> 12:34.031
I can't decide
between, like, five outfits.

12:34.056 --> 12:35.265
Don't worry, I got you.

12:35.290 --> 12:37.062
Aunt Zoe, I want to
show you my new paints.

12:39.994 --> 12:42.710
Do you think we would like
living in Atwater Village?

12:42.795 --> 12:46.218
Miguel found this place
that has the cutest coffee shop

12:46.243 --> 12:49.265
on the corner, and it's
five minutes away from you guys.

12:51.430 --> 12:54.640
I guess. And what about Santa Monica?

12:54.931 --> 12:56.343
I know that you love the ocean.

12:56.394 --> 12:58.757
Yeah, but isn't that,
like, an hour away?

12:58.782 --> 13:00.656
I mean, we're moving here to help you.

13:00.681 --> 13:03.383
I want to be able to just... pop over.

13:08.924 --> 13:10.437
Do you think he's warm enough?

13:11.103 --> 13:14.196
- Yeah.
- 'Cause, you know, I could ask for...

13:14.221 --> 13:15.531
I think he's fine.

13:16.030 --> 13:17.164
Okay.

13:20.198 --> 13:22.335
They just haven't taken his
temperature for a little bit,

13:22.438 --> 13:25.382
and we're supposed to take
his temperature regularly

13:25.407 --> 13:26.859
when he's out of the Isolette,

13:26.884 --> 13:29.140
- so...
- Okay, I'll put him back.

13:29.674 --> 13:33.031
I'm-I'm probably just being
a little overcautious.

13:33.056 --> 13:36.085
And you think I'm not being
overly cautious?

13:36.110 --> 13:38.328
No. That's not what
I'm saying, sweetheart.

13:38.353 --> 13:39.773
I just, I have in my notes

13:39.798 --> 13:41.156
that we're suppo...

13:42.403 --> 13:43.562
Nurse?

13:44.928 --> 13:46.179
Nurse!

13:46.853 --> 13:48.148
We need help over here!

13:51.920 --> 13:53.084
Hey.

13:53.235 --> 13:54.890
Hey. Hey.

13:54.915 --> 13:57.283
There you go. It's okay.

13:57.308 --> 13:58.703
He's okay. I tapped him.

13:58.728 --> 13:59.937
He's fine, see?

14:01.558 --> 14:03.093
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

14:03.270 --> 14:04.992
He was bradying, and I tapped him

14:05.017 --> 14:08.203
the way that Dr. Green told us
to, and I think he's okay

14:08.228 --> 14:09.398
'cause the alarm shut off.

14:09.423 --> 14:11.953
- Yup, he's breathing just fine.
- Yeah?

14:11.978 --> 14:13.296
Way to go, Grandma.

14:13.367 --> 14:15.578
No, I mean, I didn't really do anything.

14:18.516 --> 14:19.914
I would have tapped him.

14:20.855 --> 14:23.367
But I wanted to make sure
the nurses were coming.

14:23.392 --> 14:25.328
I know you would have done that,
of course.

14:25.353 --> 14:26.453
No, but when I hold him,

14:26.478 --> 14:27.875
it regulates his breathing,

14:28.169 --> 14:30.750
but I put him down because
you were driving me crazy.

14:37.623 --> 14:39.812
Um, I'm gonna just, uh...

14:40.657 --> 14:43.367
I'm gonna head back
to your house, and I'll, um,

14:43.512 --> 14:45.265
take Audio to the dog park.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.578
Mom and I were supposed to build
an obstacle course for Hammy.

14:53.070 --> 14:55.164
Well, Hammy looks tired.
I don't, I don't think

14:55.189 --> 14:56.890
he should be doing any obstacles, Kev.

14:58.424 --> 15:00.531
Mom and I were supposed
to watch Hook tonight.

15:00.857 --> 15:03.250
Okay, well, you can...
we can watch it tomorrow.

15:03.275 --> 15:04.921
But it's due back
to Blockbuster tomorrow.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.992
Well, we'll just, we'll re-rent it, pal.

15:07.226 --> 15:08.710
Blockbuster's not going anywhere.

15:08.737 --> 15:10.499
Randall said she might
have brain damage.

15:10.524 --> 15:11.585
What?

15:11.610 --> 15:14.296
Come on, guys, your mom,
she doesn't have brain damage.

15:14.390 --> 15:16.057
All right, here, clear-clear the table.

15:16.223 --> 15:18.015
Dinner... is served.

15:18.430 --> 15:19.515
Ew.

15:19.955 --> 15:21.132
What is this?

15:21.782 --> 15:23.117
Corn sandwiches.

15:23.272 --> 15:25.679
I used to eat these all the time
before I met your mom.

15:26.274 --> 15:27.843
You're really lucky you met her.

15:27.876 --> 15:29.390
Ha, ha, very funny.

15:29.827 --> 15:31.027
Try one.

15:31.693 --> 15:32.953
Go on, try it.

15:34.097 --> 15:35.242
It's good, right?

15:35.354 --> 15:36.976
And it's good for you, you know,

15:37.001 --> 15:38.351
'cause corn.

15:40.656 --> 15:43.210
We were supposed to have lasagna
before Mom got run over.

15:43.235 --> 15:44.734
She didn't get run over, Kev.
She's fine.

15:44.759 --> 15:46.093
Then why couldn't she come home?

15:46.118 --> 15:48.125
Because they're just
being extra cautious.

15:48.150 --> 15:49.929
Cautious that she
doesn't have brain damage?

15:49.954 --> 15:51.031
- Kev, she doesn't have...
- Do you even think Mom'll be

15:51.056 --> 15:52.453
able to understand Hook
when she gets home?

15:52.478 --> 15:54.328
Yes, she will be able
to understand Hook.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.359
Now, all of you, eat your dinner.

16:05.552 --> 16:07.420
- Hey, who wants ice cream?
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.445 --> 16:08.687
Yeah? Okay.

16:08.791 --> 16:11.703
Tess? Yo. Hey. We're making
brownies downstairs

16:11.728 --> 16:13.429
if you want to... Oh, my God,
what happened in here?

16:13.454 --> 16:15.398
It's like a Forever 21 exploded.

16:15.423 --> 16:17.828
I'm still trying to pick
an outfit for yearbook photos.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.640
I thought you and Zoe
landed on something.

16:19.665 --> 16:22.945
We did, but I hate it.
I hate all my clothes.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.046
Okay, well, why don't you tell your mom?

16:27.071 --> 16:28.117
I'm sure she'll take you shopping.

16:28.142 --> 16:30.921
She's too busy teaching all the
time and fighting with my dad.

16:32.044 --> 16:33.195
They fighting?

16:33.727 --> 16:36.117
Not like yelling fighting,

16:36.142 --> 16:37.375
but I can tell.

16:37.491 --> 16:39.726
So I'm trying not to bother them
with my stuff.

16:41.088 --> 16:42.164
Okay.

16:43.279 --> 16:44.953
I get that, but you know what,

16:44.978 --> 16:46.312
um, well, you wouldn't be bothering me

16:46.337 --> 16:48.062
with your stuff, you know?

16:48.754 --> 16:49.835
What do you got?

16:52.166 --> 16:54.914
Tess, come on, look,
I got a lot more going on

16:54.939 --> 16:56.406
up here than people give me credit for.

16:56.431 --> 16:57.671
Come on, hit me.

17:00.382 --> 17:02.703
Do you remember
when I told you I was gay?

17:03.072 --> 17:05.429
Mm-hmm. Via text.
It was very modern of you.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.179
I thought coming out to you guys

17:11.636 --> 17:13.140
would be the hardest part,

17:14.460 --> 17:15.664
but instead

17:15.849 --> 17:18.551
I just have a million
more questions about myself.

17:18.964 --> 17:22.233
Like, what clothes make me feel
like "the real me"?

17:22.578 --> 17:26.289
What books should I be reading?
What movies should I be seeing?

17:28.211 --> 17:30.390
When will I finally decide
to tell my friends?

17:36.143 --> 17:37.243
What you got?

17:39.332 --> 17:41.820
I-I've never been through what
you're going through right now.

17:43.077 --> 17:45.382
I mean, I once had to kiss
Topher Grace in this indie film

17:45.407 --> 17:47.210
that I did, but that wasn't like...

17:52.065 --> 17:53.531
Tess, I'm not gonna sit here and

17:53.556 --> 17:55.945
pretend like I know how you're
feeling, okay, 'cause I don't,

17:55.970 --> 17:58.335
but, you know, this whole idea
of not really knowing

17:58.360 --> 18:00.595
who you are deep down inside,
that's my life story.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.398
Please.

18:02.423 --> 18:04.125
No, wait, hold on, hear me out, though.

18:04.618 --> 18:05.734
Um...

18:08.694 --> 18:10.429
I'll tell you what,
one thing that I have learned,

18:11.270 --> 18:12.311
um...

18:12.965 --> 18:15.992
I don't think we figure out
exactly who we are all at once.

18:17.740 --> 18:20.250
I think it happens over
a long period of time,

18:20.275 --> 18:22.143
just, like, piece by piece, you know?

18:22.582 --> 18:24.914
Like, um... Okay, take, me for instance.

18:24.939 --> 18:27.374
A couple years ago,
I get close with your dad,

18:27.447 --> 18:30.117
and I find a piece of myself in that.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.484
And then I meet your aunt,
and I, and I find

18:32.509 --> 18:33.828
another piece of myself.

18:35.777 --> 18:38.101
Honey, I think that's sort of
how it works, you know.

18:38.674 --> 18:40.687
I think we go through this life
slowly but surely,

18:40.712 --> 18:42.921
just collecting these
little pieces of ourselves

18:43.280 --> 18:45.195
that we can't really live without until,

18:45.733 --> 18:48.233
you know, eventually, we have
enough of them to where we...

18:48.258 --> 18:49.365
we feel whole.

18:54.071 --> 18:55.820
And you think that'll happen for me?

18:56.774 --> 18:58.875
Nah, probably not. I mean,
you're not that special.

19:00.589 --> 19:02.031
Do I think it will happen for you?

19:02.056 --> 19:03.328
I know it will happen for you.

19:04.695 --> 19:05.896
Tess Pearson,

19:05.989 --> 19:07.734
you, my niece, have

19:07.759 --> 19:11.273
so many years ahead of you
to find all of your pieces.

19:14.422 --> 19:15.937
Now, was that corny, or did I just...

19:15.962 --> 19:17.162
did I nail it?

19:17.938 --> 19:19.476
- No? Laid it on too think?
- You nailed it.

19:19.501 --> 19:20.843
I nailed it. Yes!

19:21.085 --> 19:23.386
I felt pretty strong there
at the end, yeah.

19:23.753 --> 19:28.054
Release. Turn in. Big finish.
And bend down.

19:28.079 --> 19:30.247
Beautiful, beautiful. And finish.

19:30.560 --> 19:31.617
Beautiful.

19:31.642 --> 19:33.765
And great class, ladies.

19:34.471 --> 19:37.210
All right, next week
we'll focus on jetés, right?

19:37.352 --> 19:39.039
And hopefully hear the next chapter

19:39.064 --> 19:41.226
in the saga of Diane's
neighbor's yappy dog.

19:48.055 --> 19:49.155
Hey, Beth.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.531
Tanya's got strep.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.929
Do you think you could cover
her Sunday a.m. class?

19:53.331 --> 19:54.703
- Oh, sure.
- Great.

19:54.744 --> 19:56.007
You can do it with your eyes closed.

19:56.032 --> 19:57.898
It's literally just four moms
with no rhythm

19:57.923 --> 19:59.671
trying to drop ten pounds
they'll never drop.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.953
You sure this is the right address?

20:23.824 --> 20:25.734
This neighborhood looks a little rough.

20:25.813 --> 20:27.375
Yup. This is it.

20:34.713 --> 20:35.898
Uh...

20:36.106 --> 20:37.742
where's the school?

20:38.665 --> 20:40.343
Oh, there's no school.

20:41.072 --> 20:43.093
There's no debate team either.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.757
I think arguing with random strangers

20:45.782 --> 20:47.359
about weird stuff is stupid.

20:47.781 --> 20:50.703
Oh. Okay. So where are we?

20:52.865 --> 20:55.101
You remember a while back
when you took me

20:55.126 --> 20:57.060
to your dad's building
because you wanted me

20:57.085 --> 20:58.554
to sign my adoption papers?

20:58.639 --> 20:59.703
Yeah.

20:59.765 --> 21:02.664
Remember when...
you told me you had everything

21:02.689 --> 21:04.304
you were gonna say planned out?

21:04.727 --> 21:06.226
- Yeah?
- Yeah, well...

21:06.251 --> 21:08.390
you're not the only one
in the world who can

21:08.415 --> 21:10.382
drag somebody on a long car ride

21:10.407 --> 21:13.009
just to give them a big speech
at a meaningful location.

21:17.174 --> 21:19.367
I lived in this house for eight months

21:19.392 --> 21:20.914
when my mom was in rehab.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.421
Oh, wow.

21:23.464 --> 21:24.539
Deja, I didn't know you...

21:24.564 --> 21:25.851
Not now, I'm doing a speech.

21:27.444 --> 21:29.976
Now, there were houses where the parents

21:30.001 --> 21:31.554
drank more or...

21:32.135 --> 21:34.343
they hit harder, but, um...

21:35.538 --> 21:36.937
this house...

21:38.098 --> 21:40.710
this was Mr. and Mrs. Johnson's house.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.109
This is where they kept you hungry.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.828
Now, they would load up on foster kids,

21:48.853 --> 21:50.187
as many as they can get,

21:50.212 --> 21:51.898
just for the government stipend

21:51.923 --> 21:53.242
and they would blow

21:53.795 --> 21:55.421
all the money they got...

21:55.977 --> 21:58.045
on scratcher tickets.

22:00.223 --> 22:02.101
Anyway... every single night,

22:02.126 --> 22:04.648
we would split a can of soup

22:04.675 --> 22:06.578
four ways, five ways.

22:07.119 --> 22:10.454
And just watch Mr. Johnson
scratch his way

22:10.479 --> 22:12.296
through... $30 worth

22:12.321 --> 22:15.593
of those stupid scratcher tickets.

22:18.128 --> 22:20.695
One night he didn't
even bother to buy the soup.

22:22.302 --> 22:23.351
So...

22:23.812 --> 22:26.085
I stole one of his
tickets when he was...

22:26.203 --> 22:27.773
getting up to grab a beer.

22:29.590 --> 22:30.898
And if we won,

22:31.262 --> 22:33.312
we were going to sneak out to buy

22:33.337 --> 22:35.195
burgers and fries and...

22:35.400 --> 22:37.921
dip 'em in the, the chocolate Frosties.

22:37.946 --> 22:39.031
Have you ever done that?

22:39.056 --> 22:40.109
No?

22:40.621 --> 22:41.835
It's the best.

22:41.953 --> 22:43.679
It's so good.

22:44.906 --> 22:46.664
But, of course...

22:47.250 --> 22:48.554
we didn't win.

22:50.464 --> 22:52.562
Nobody ever won at that house.

22:54.756 --> 22:57.320
'Cause most people don't win, Randall.

22:58.985 --> 23:00.328
But you did.

23:01.424 --> 23:04.070
You won the lottery. You won it twice.

23:04.206 --> 23:07.585
Once when you got adopted
and again when you met Beth.

23:09.336 --> 23:12.398
I don't know what's going on
between you two,

23:12.961 --> 23:14.593
but you got to get it together.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.640
You owe it to the world...

23:20.057 --> 23:22.710
that let you win the lottery twice.

23:29.664 --> 23:30.647
Now come on.

23:30.854 --> 23:32.359
This speech made me want a burger.

24:34.259 --> 24:36.561
Get me whatever you're having
with an iced tea.

24:36.586 --> 24:38.696
All right? Got to make a quick call.

24:51.412 --> 24:52.912
Randall, hey, I've got

24:52.937 --> 24:55.102
- your schedule for Monday.
- Hey, Jae-Won.

24:55.127 --> 24:56.586
I know my swearing in is coming up,

24:56.611 --> 24:58.000
but I need to ask you something.

24:58.341 --> 25:00.860
And after I do, I need you
to take a deep breath

25:01.336 --> 25:02.969
and then answer me calmly.

25:03.750 --> 25:04.860
Hit me.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.733
Okay, um...

25:08.482 --> 25:09.703
what would happen...

25:11.031 --> 25:12.156
if I resigned?

25:13.219 --> 25:14.242
What?

25:14.267 --> 25:15.571
What do you mean, resigned?

25:16.361 --> 25:18.110
Like from city council, if I decided

25:18.135 --> 25:20.117
I couldn't go through
with accepting the position.

25:20.174 --> 25:22.883
Oh, God, I knew I should
have taken that job at MSNBC

25:22.908 --> 25:24.000
- when I had the chance.
- Jae-Won.

25:24.025 --> 25:25.358
I'm not saying it's happening.

25:25.383 --> 25:27.375
I just need to know what would happen.

25:28.107 --> 25:29.586
Will you talk me through it, please?

25:29.976 --> 25:31.156
Just step by step.

25:33.349 --> 25:35.063
You'd need to do it in writing.

25:36.719 --> 25:38.008
Things would break quickly.

25:38.033 --> 25:40.328
Um, there'd be
an emergency special election

25:40.353 --> 25:43.086
paid for by the taxpayers who
just paid for the last election.

25:44.121 --> 25:46.180
It would basically confirm
the worst fears

25:46.205 --> 25:48.016
of everyone who put
their faith in an outsider

25:48.041 --> 25:50.524
with zero experience
in government or politics.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.031
Got it.

25:53.179 --> 25:54.672
Thank you for educating me.

25:55.797 --> 25:57.305
Randall... you're not
really thinking about...

25:57.330 --> 25:58.379
Got to run, Jae-Won.

26:06.321 --> 26:07.563
Yeah. Oh, I love these.

26:07.588 --> 26:09.189
- These are great.
- Yeah.

26:11.902 --> 26:13.503
Oh, I... oh, well, thank you.

26:13.722 --> 26:14.946
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

26:17.906 --> 26:20.703
Um... the brownies smell
like they're almost done.

26:20.751 --> 26:21.836
You want to go check?

26:21.861 --> 26:23.367
- I'll meet you in there. Okay.
- Okay.

26:28.663 --> 26:29.781
What?

26:39.437 --> 26:41.852
You know, my mom didn't want
kids at first either.

26:43.471 --> 26:44.836
- Is that right?
- Mm-hmm.

26:45.787 --> 26:47.906
Yup. Not for a really long time, anyway.

26:47.931 --> 26:49.164
And then she, uh...

26:50.730 --> 26:51.992
she was amazing at it.

26:53.638 --> 26:55.203
She used to do this thing, she would...

26:55.473 --> 26:57.281
she would write these really dumb jokes

26:57.306 --> 26:58.860
on the, the banana peels

26:58.885 --> 27:01.235
of the bananas that she would
pack for our lunches...

27:01.446 --> 27:02.781
...when we were kids...
did I ever tell you that?

27:02.806 --> 27:04.313
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:04.338 --> 27:06.344
Uh, five days a week. Three jokes.

27:06.369 --> 27:07.594
Every day, I mean...

27:08.281 --> 27:09.352
that's...

27:10.477 --> 27:12.031
that's next-level, right?

27:15.699 --> 27:17.805
I guess all I'm saying is,
I think sometimes,

27:18.419 --> 27:20.071
you know, people think
they know what they want...

27:21.283 --> 27:22.664
but then time goes by

27:22.689 --> 27:24.500
and things just, they change.

27:25.462 --> 27:26.594
Hmm.

27:29.293 --> 27:31.578
Watching you with the girls, Zoe, you...

27:33.143 --> 27:34.469
You're amazing with them.

27:35.939 --> 27:37.742
And I think, maybe...

27:37.767 --> 27:38.836
uh...

27:40.124 --> 27:41.491
I'd be pretty good at it, too.

27:44.847 --> 27:46.055
Aunt Zoe.

27:46.988 --> 27:48.172
I got to...

27:48.197 --> 27:49.805
- go check on the brownies.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:56.220 --> 27:57.242
Hey, man.

27:57.368 --> 27:59.274
- Hey.
- Didn't expect you to still be here.

27:59.474 --> 28:00.586
Where's Beth?

28:10.051 --> 28:12.094
Thank you so much for
meeting me on such short notice.

28:12.119 --> 28:13.086
No problem.

28:13.111 --> 28:14.844
I'm honored to meet
the new councilman's wife.

28:16.109 --> 28:17.953
So I'd love to hear more about you.

28:18.150 --> 28:19.891
It'll help me find exactly
what you're looking for.

28:19.951 --> 28:22.508
Okay. Well, as you know,
my husband will be

28:22.533 --> 28:24.578
working down here full-time, and...

28:24.958 --> 28:27.164
the commute from our house in
Jersey's already killing him.

28:27.189 --> 28:28.656
He hasn't even been sworn in yet.

28:29.496 --> 28:30.867
We thought we could make it work,

28:30.892 --> 28:32.485
but it's pretty clear that we can't.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.321
So here we are.

28:35.287 --> 28:36.336
Here we are.

28:38.758 --> 28:40.602
I think you will really love Philly.

28:41.461 --> 28:43.219
- Let's go see some places.
- Great.

28:55.857 --> 28:57.190
Yeah, come in.

28:58.744 --> 29:00.133
We can't sleep.

29:01.642 --> 29:03.266
I had a nightmare about Mom.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.805
She looked like Freddy Krueger

29:04.830 --> 29:06.633
and her face was wrapped in bandages.

29:06.658 --> 29:08.266
And then he woke us up and told us

29:08.291 --> 29:09.938
all about it and freaked us out.

29:12.778 --> 29:13.820
Okay.

29:14.871 --> 29:16.320
Okay, this is ridiculous.

29:16.345 --> 29:18.734
Put your shoes, jackets on.
Let's go see Mom.

29:24.159 --> 29:26.913
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:29.653 --> 29:30.913
How's the baby?

29:32.639 --> 29:34.929
He's good. He slept for most of the day.

29:34.954 --> 29:36.955
Toby just got to the hospital,
so I'm just gonna...

29:37.315 --> 29:38.679
take a shower and I'll head back.

29:38.704 --> 29:40.476
- Hey, Bug?
- Hmm?

29:40.979 --> 29:42.945
I'm sorry if I, uh...

29:43.208 --> 29:44.468
overstepped.

29:46.411 --> 29:48.366
Or if the idea of us

29:48.466 --> 29:50.132
moving out here makes you feel...

29:50.157 --> 29:51.351
No.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.898
You knew exactly what to do today.

29:58.528 --> 30:00.913
You always know exactly what to do.

30:01.053 --> 30:02.898
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it is.

30:04.894 --> 30:06.687
It is, and...

30:07.583 --> 30:09.210
I just feel like I'm never going to be

30:09.235 --> 30:10.906
as good a mom as you.

30:12.023 --> 30:13.382
Also not true.

30:16.586 --> 30:17.601
I need you to know,

30:17.626 --> 30:19.538
the way that I react
to you sometimes, it's...

30:21.095 --> 30:22.288
it's on me.

30:22.392 --> 30:24.296
It's my own insecurities.

30:25.644 --> 30:28.257
I don't know how the hell
I'm ever gonna live up to you.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.320
You know, you...

30:34.702 --> 30:36.788
you have this magical quality.

30:38.542 --> 30:39.843
Just being you.

30:39.991 --> 30:41.960
And you always made us feel really safe.

30:45.469 --> 30:46.936
I want you to be here.

30:48.060 --> 30:49.187
For me.

30:49.536 --> 30:51.265
But-but even more for Jack.

30:52.561 --> 30:53.656
You know?

30:53.681 --> 30:55.257
I want my son to...

30:55.774 --> 30:58.577
grow up with the Rebecca
Pearson-level magic, too.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.382
I think that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

31:08.077 --> 31:09.273
Mom.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.163
Aw...

31:11.299 --> 31:13.296
- Well, good.
- Thank you.

31:18.707 --> 31:21.366
can I just apologize in advance for, uh,

31:21.521 --> 31:23.021
being triggered by everything
you're gonna say

31:23.046 --> 31:25.343
and treating you like
a punching bag for the next

31:25.368 --> 31:26.602
year or two, 'cause...

31:27.093 --> 31:28.163
That's fine.

31:28.414 --> 31:29.827
It's what I'm here for.

31:32.304 --> 31:34.023
Well, I am juicing tonight.

31:34.048 --> 31:35.640
Way too many brownies for me.

31:48.159 --> 31:49.273
Kevin.

31:50.847 --> 31:52.632
We need to talk about this.

31:54.585 --> 31:55.796
Uh, yeah, I know.

31:57.832 --> 31:59.109
You want to be a dad.

32:00.134 --> 32:01.859
Maybe not now but someday.

32:01.884 --> 32:04.140
Uh... I mean, maybe, yeah.

32:04.165 --> 32:05.554
I don't know. I don't know.

32:06.223 --> 32:08.273
And you should be a dad, Kevin.

32:08.298 --> 32:09.437
You...

32:09.667 --> 32:13.632
you should raise
500 perfectly symmetrical kids.

32:14.579 --> 32:16.132
You'll be amazing at it.

32:19.055 --> 32:20.202
And I want...

32:20.426 --> 32:22.101
I want you to have that. I...

32:22.517 --> 32:24.765
I want you to have everything you want.

32:27.783 --> 32:29.195
But I don't want that.

32:34.697 --> 32:35.968
I know. That's... I'm...

32:35.993 --> 32:37.531
Look, I made my choice, okay?

32:37.556 --> 32:38.687
I told you...

32:38.961 --> 32:40.077
I know.

32:41.937 --> 32:43.734
I think you made the wrong choice.

32:45.401 --> 32:47.132
You think I'm gonna change.

32:48.412 --> 32:49.648
And I'm not.

33:03.157 --> 33:04.820
You're really never gonna want to...

33:22.297 --> 33:24.532
Hi. Um, I'm Jack Pearson.

33:24.557 --> 33:26.640
We're here to see my wife
Rebecca Pearson.

33:26.665 --> 33:28.562
Visiting hours don't start
until 6:00 a.m.

33:28.866 --> 33:31.085
Okay, see, we're-we're not visitors.

33:31.273 --> 33:32.609
We're her family. And...

33:33.374 --> 33:34.890
Well, my kids, Th-they don't...

33:35.210 --> 33:37.311
they don't do so well without their mom.

33:37.446 --> 33:38.710
We could've made it one night.

33:39.382 --> 33:40.421
Hi.

33:41.906 --> 33:43.413
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't know what that is.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.656
Um, look, my wife,

33:45.687 --> 33:47.663
she's not used to being
without us either.

33:48.437 --> 33:50.351
But she sent us home earlier

33:50.376 --> 33:52.179
because she was trying
to be strong for us.

33:52.204 --> 33:54.105
Because, you know, that's just...
that's who my wife is.

33:54.130 --> 33:56.298
She's strong for us, but...

33:56.665 --> 34:01.351
You know, we, we don't really
work too good without her.

34:02.070 --> 34:03.171
You know,

34:03.277 --> 34:04.359
it's...

34:05.281 --> 34:06.364
It's like a car.

34:06.874 --> 34:08.422
You know, um, you-you got your...

34:08.891 --> 34:12.710
your antilock brakes, your
suspension, your-your exhaust pipes.

34:13.081 --> 34:16.045
But, you see, my wife,
she's-she's the engine.

34:16.842 --> 34:18.788
And the rest of us, we're-we're s...

34:19.821 --> 34:22.866
Well, we're useless without the engine.

34:22.891 --> 34:25.257
Do you... do you understand
what I'm saying?

34:25.661 --> 34:26.804
Not really.

34:27.202 --> 34:29.476
I'm at the end of a 24-hour shift.

34:29.572 --> 34:32.163
Honestly, I'm only hearing random words.

34:34.966 --> 34:37.679
Go ahead. Just keep your voices down

34:37.704 --> 34:38.882
until visiting hours start.

34:39.274 --> 34:41.175
Okay. Come on. Thank you.

34:41.275 --> 34:42.687
Let's move.

34:42.911 --> 34:44.976
So, maybe we'll see you around.

34:46.445 --> 34:47.773
Or not. Thank you.

34:55.924 --> 34:56.976
Hey.

34:57.266 --> 34:58.210
Hey.

34:59.484 --> 35:00.726
Classes run late?

35:01.398 --> 35:02.984
No, I had to run an errand.

35:04.398 --> 35:05.733
How'd your day go?

35:05.921 --> 35:07.134
My day?

35:07.538 --> 35:09.554
Uh, it's a funny story.

35:10.835 --> 35:12.038
There was no debate.

35:12.908 --> 35:15.031
Deja wanted to show me
her old foster home.

35:15.859 --> 35:16.898
What?

35:16.923 --> 35:19.157
Yeah, had a whole talk planned
for me and everything.

35:19.694 --> 35:21.031
It was very me.

35:24.359 --> 35:25.765
She's worried about us.

35:27.124 --> 35:29.124
Apparently, she and Tess can feel it.

35:29.387 --> 35:31.822
Oh. I hate that.

35:32.048 --> 35:33.163
Yeah, me, too.

35:38.571 --> 35:40.054
I'm gonna resign, Beth.

35:42.218 --> 35:43.734
- Randall...
- It's just a job.

35:44.062 --> 35:45.913
At the end of the day, it's just a job.

35:48.260 --> 35:49.984
I won the lottery, baby.

35:51.370 --> 35:52.976
Oh, that's what Deja called it.

35:53.995 --> 35:55.718
Me landing you.

35:58.497 --> 36:00.765
- Smart kid.
- Yeah, she is.

36:02.399 --> 36:04.163
I thought I could figure out
a way to do this

36:04.188 --> 36:05.421
that wouldn't hurt us.

36:06.882 --> 36:08.374
But I wasn't realistic.

36:09.812 --> 36:12.445
- I bit off more than I could chew.
- You're not gonna resign, Randall.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.835
We're moving to Philadelphia.

36:21.945 --> 36:23.187
No.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.202
I won't make us uproot our lives.

36:25.614 --> 36:27.234
And I won't let you give up
on your dream.

36:27.259 --> 36:28.827
I'm not giving up on my dream.

36:30.202 --> 36:31.991
Randall, I found the door.

36:34.913 --> 36:37.390
I'm gonna open my own dance studio.

36:38.265 --> 36:39.406
In Philly.

36:43.048 --> 36:46.091
I want to cut the ribbon
on a place of my very own,

36:46.116 --> 36:48.269
one that I can run
the way that I want to.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.421
But city council doesn't pay enough.

36:51.140 --> 36:53.296
- How are we gonna afford...
- We scale back.

36:54.327 --> 36:55.476
We bet on us.

36:55.501 --> 36:57.218
We have a lot tied up in this house.

36:57.624 --> 36:59.046
You want to sell this house?

36:59.804 --> 37:02.327
But, baby, we got married in this house.

37:03.195 --> 37:05.773
- We raised our family in this house.
- I know.

37:06.555 --> 37:09.007
And it served us well for a long time.

37:11.391 --> 37:13.179
With what you want to do, we're gonna...

37:13.996 --> 37:16.374
we're gonna have to get
a much smaller place.

37:16.562 --> 37:17.679
Well...

37:18.484 --> 37:20.726
guess it'll be easier
for me to find you then.

37:24.820 --> 37:26.632
We don't work when we're apart.

37:28.124 --> 37:29.515
But, together...

37:30.913 --> 37:32.171
baby,

37:33.093 --> 37:35.718
together, we set the world on fire.

37:48.026 --> 37:49.116
Hi, Mom.

37:49.307 --> 37:50.468
Hey, you.

37:57.243 --> 37:58.359
Ooh, coffee.

38:05.147 --> 38:06.288
Hey, baby.

38:06.555 --> 38:07.796
Hey.

38:11.445 --> 38:12.632
Mm.

38:17.359 --> 38:18.577
You okay?

38:23.132 --> 38:24.538
You want coffee?

38:25.109 --> 38:26.234
Yeah.

39:28.997 --> 39:30.890
Man, Kevin's house is huge.

39:31.867 --> 39:33.234
Thanks for calling.

39:36.977 --> 39:38.311
I got the, uh...

39:39.109 --> 39:40.441
sidewalk chalk.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.296
I just talked to Jack,

39:43.062 --> 39:44.378
and they're on their way.

39:44.546 --> 39:46.554
I'm glad you decided to come.

39:47.890 --> 39:49.171
Of course.

39:49.672 --> 39:50.706
Come on in.

40:13.171 --> 40:14.593
Good to see you, too, bud.

40:14.898 --> 40:16.110
Oh. Hey, Uncle Randall.

40:16.135 --> 40:17.179
Thank you.

40:17.351 --> 40:18.648
Hey, where's your dad?

40:18.820 --> 40:21.718
Uh, he went to go get takeout.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.460
He realized we didn't have any food.

40:25.077 --> 40:26.273
Classic Kevin.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.156
Knock, knock, knock. Look who's here.

40:29.265 --> 40:30.825
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:31.109 --> 40:32.718
- Hey. Where is he?
- My God,

40:32.743 --> 40:34.679
- do you have enough luggage?
- Well, I had no choice.

40:34.704 --> 40:36.534
- Hi.
- Mwah. I'm here indefinitely.

40:37.124 --> 40:39.179
- Indefinitely?
- Indefinitely.

40:39.225 --> 40:41.070
Wait, Kev, you don't think
you're living here, do you?

40:41.095 --> 40:42.829
With no room service? No, thank you.

40:43.437 --> 40:44.734
- But don't you worry about a thing.
- Careful.

40:44.759 --> 40:46.716
I will be here all the time.

40:46.741 --> 40:48.445
Look how handsome you are.

40:48.984 --> 40:50.820
Hey, Tobes, you got any, uh, Perrier?

40:51.343 --> 40:53.148
We're parched. We're parched.

40:53.173 --> 40:54.484
We got thirsty.

40:55.223 --> 40:56.390
All right.

40:56.751 --> 40:58.124
I'm gonna go say hi.

40:59.492 --> 41:01.171
Oh, um, where is...?

41:01.196 --> 41:02.468
He's already in there.

41:37.458 --> 41:38.583
Hi, Mom.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.184
It's Randall.

41:41.434 --> 41:43.177
Your son, Randall.

41:54.770 --> 41:56.020
Hey, Nicky.
