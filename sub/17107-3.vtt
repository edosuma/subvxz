NARRATOR: Previously,
on "Dance Academy".

00:04.440 --> 00:05.679
-You didn't think we would
worry about you?

00:05.719 --> 00:06.599
-Who's we?

00:06.639 --> 00:07.200
-Everyone.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.400
Your friends.

00:08.439 --> 00:09.640
-Not friends here.

00:09.679 --> 00:11.480
Have a great trip back.

00:11.519 --> 00:12.759
-Listen, guys.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.720
We're up against the last
day of re-enrollment.

00:13.759 --> 00:17.679
Have any of you heard
anything?

00:17.719 --> 00:19.239
-The I Quit speech?

00:19.280 --> 00:20.800
I've heard it 100 times.

00:20.839 --> 00:23.480
The next two weeks,
you're off sick.

00:23.519 --> 00:25.160
No classes, no work.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.239
Tell everyone you have
pharyngitis.

00:27.280 --> 00:27.839
-Where's Sonny?

00:27.879 --> 00:29.039
He's on right now.

00:29.079 --> 00:30.719
-He was in an accident.

00:30.760 --> 00:32.119
We're his family.

00:39.679 --> 00:41.640
[theme music]

01:26.760 --> 01:28.239
KAT NARRATING: Early risers.

01:28.280 --> 01:31.040
Studies by clever boyfriends
show they tend to be more

01:31.079 --> 01:32.439
positive and super successful.

01:36.439 --> 01:37.719
Positivity.

01:37.760 --> 01:39.799
That's the key.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.519
Sure, I've got reasons
to be glum.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.799
We all do.

01:43.840 --> 01:48.400
But glum won't get me into
third year, no siree.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.159
Boyfriends fact two.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.840
Continuous exercise and smiling
are two activities

01:52.879 --> 01:56.400
which release endorphins,
nature's antidepressants.

01:56.439 --> 02:00.200
Therefore, if I keep this up,
I'm going to feel amazing.

02:00.239 --> 02:03.640
And if I feel amazing, well,
this whole year will be a

02:03.680 --> 02:05.120
piece of cake--

02:05.159 --> 02:06.719
not that I'm allowed cake.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.038
-Ah!

02:08.080 --> 02:09.318
-Escape is futile, Earthling!

02:09.360 --> 02:11.159
-Dudes, it's like dawn!

02:11.199 --> 02:12.719
-So are you back or
are you back?

02:12.759 --> 02:14.599
-Well, I figure this place
is as good as any to

02:14.639 --> 02:15.680
cruise for a year.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.080
-Cruise?

02:17.120 --> 02:19.039
You have no idea how intense
her classes are right now.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.680
-I'm back five minutes and
she already wants to

02:20.719 --> 02:22.080
punch out my life.

02:22.120 --> 02:24.360
[laughter]

02:24.400 --> 02:26.639
-How do you possibly
have Gaga tickets?

02:26.680 --> 02:28.639
-We have a private
afterparty--

02:28.680 --> 02:30.680
Mardi Gras Gaga tickets.

02:30.719 --> 02:32.479
-Squeal.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.560
-There you are.

02:34.599 --> 02:36.719
-So you know, Lucy?

02:36.759 --> 02:40.199
I may scrape in a touch after
curfew tomorrow night.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.479
-Actually, you'll be performing
in Le Catra-art,

02:42.520 --> 02:46.800
and then heading directly
to the boarding house.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.599
-Minor setback?

02:47.639 --> 02:48.800
Count me in.

02:52.319 --> 02:53.479
Well, that was embarrassing.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.319
We have to set some ground
rules of behavior.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.599
-Yes, we do.

02:56.639 --> 02:59.159
I waited in my office for
you this morning again.

02:59.199 --> 03:00.560
-Sorry.

03:00.599 --> 03:02.280
I didn't realize our little
catch-ups were compulsory.

03:02.319 --> 03:04.120
-You and I both acknowledged
they were issues last year, so

03:04.159 --> 03:05.719
don't get narky when I check
on your progress.

03:05.759 --> 03:07.800
-Yeah, I wasn't making
good friends at the

03:07.840 --> 03:09.639
very top of our strategy.

03:09.680 --> 03:12.080
-When you graduate, you can
cavort with the company girls

03:12.120 --> 03:13.400
as much as you'd like.

03:13.439 --> 03:17.520
Until then, I embarrass you
as much as I see fit.

03:17.560 --> 03:18.680
Open your feet.

03:18.719 --> 03:20.719
Surely it's not such an
impossible concept.

03:20.759 --> 03:23.400
How long have you been
students here?

03:23.439 --> 03:25.319
Open your feet.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.840
Get your heels down.

03:26.879 --> 03:31.840
-Is that Madame Patrova
back from the grave?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.439
Madame Patrova would never
have put up with this

03:33.479 --> 03:35.439
sloppiness from us when
we were students.

03:35.479 --> 03:36.919
-Ah, she's right.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.479
Madame would beat us with a
walking stick, and my delicate

03:39.520 --> 03:40.719
skin would bruise so easily.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.280
-Students, I'd like to introduce
Marcus Kane,

03:48.319 --> 03:50.599
Artistic Director of
the Austin Ballet.

03:50.639 --> 03:53.479
-Lucy's told me from holiday
boat to reveal the entirety of

03:53.520 --> 03:55.800
my wisdom to the second
years, which should

03:55.840 --> 03:57.159
take about 15 minutes.

03:57.199 --> 04:06.159
-[laughing]

04:06.199 --> 04:08.639
-So you just bat those sleepy
lashes and the Academy begs

04:08.680 --> 04:09.840
you to come back?

04:09.879 --> 04:11.400
-I have friends in
high places.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.199
How was Barcelona?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.199
-I have Lyme disease.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.399
Official bed rest.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.199
-Give me feeling, guys--
if not for me,

04:30.240 --> 04:32.240
then for our guest.

04:32.279 --> 04:33.839
-Ah, ballet teaches art.

04:33.879 --> 04:36.439
We imprison you for ten hours
a day, then we complain when

04:36.480 --> 04:38.120
you're not unique snowflakes.

04:44.560 --> 04:45.839
Look.

04:45.879 --> 04:48.079
There's this assignment I've
given my company before.

04:48.120 --> 04:49.040
It's, um-- sorry, Zach.

04:49.079 --> 04:50.720
Am I allowed to give
assignments?

04:50.759 --> 04:52.639
-Nothing makes them happy.

04:52.680 --> 04:53.959
-Good.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.839
Now, to create different
characters, you need to step

04:56.879 --> 04:59.319
outside yourselves and
your training.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.639
Hmm?

05:00.680 --> 05:03.360
Just let all that go.

05:03.399 --> 05:05.800
Become actors.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.800
Now, this piece you're doing,
I want you to find someone--

05:08.839 --> 05:11.160
a non-dancer.

05:11.199 --> 05:14.160
Study them from inside out.

05:14.199 --> 05:17.160
What makes them tick?

05:17.199 --> 05:18.639
Then I want you to
reinterpret your

05:18.680 --> 05:21.199
performance as that person.

05:44.199 --> 05:45.160
-Come on, Ricky.

05:45.199 --> 05:46.480
Is Marcus single?

05:46.519 --> 05:49.199
-Divorced, I believe.

05:49.240 --> 05:50.160
How is that relevant?

05:50.199 --> 05:51.160
We're old friends.

05:51.199 --> 05:52.079
We haven't seen each
other in years.

05:57.439 --> 05:59.399
-Hi.

05:59.439 --> 06:00.199
-Out.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.759
Out.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.600
We're six weeks into term.

06:04.639 --> 06:07.319
-Well, Christian and I could
do one-on-one classes.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.279
It'd only be, what?

06:08.319 --> 06:09.759
An extra 10 or 12
hours a week.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.040
-Unfortunately, it's not just
a matter of making up what's

06:12.079 --> 06:14.240
being missed.

06:14.279 --> 06:16.439
You know your place here depends
on a scholarship.

06:16.480 --> 06:17.519
The board told me
they've already

06:17.560 --> 06:19.560
redistributed those funds.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.800
-Well, they meet again
tomorrow, don't they?

06:20.839 --> 06:22.480
We could take it to them--
please extenuating

06:22.519 --> 06:23.720
circumstances.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.720
-If it's too hard--

06:24.759 --> 06:25.800
-We'll sort this
out, all right?

06:25.839 --> 06:27.160
This is where you belong.

06:55.199 --> 06:55.680
-Oh!

06:55.720 --> 06:56.560
-Clumsy much?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.519
-Sorry.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.120
-Don't worry about it.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.800
I've seen you around,
haven't I?

07:03.839 --> 07:06.560
-There are millions of girls
who look like me.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.800
It's a blonde thing.

07:07.839 --> 07:09.600
No one really looks
at the face.

07:09.639 --> 07:10.800
-Huh.

07:10.839 --> 07:12.160
I'm Nick, by the way.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.759
-I know.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.680
I mean, you look like a Nick.

07:15.720 --> 07:16.319
-Yeah.

07:16.360 --> 07:17.480
-Nick-esque.

07:17.519 --> 07:19.079
OK.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.279
I'm going to head off now.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.519
-So who'd you pick?

07:49.560 --> 07:52.560
This is some pretty
angry stuff.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.560
-That's what I was going for.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.519
This guy who's not
a good person.

07:58.560 --> 08:01.480
-It might sound namby-pamby,
but, um, the assignment's

08:01.519 --> 08:04.199
about getting into this
guy's head, yeah?

08:04.240 --> 08:08.040
And seeing things from
his perspective.

08:08.079 --> 08:09.279
-OK.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.680
So donuts help with
dengue fever?

08:24.720 --> 08:27.600
-Get in!

08:27.639 --> 08:29.800
-Kat, tell him he can't wear
this to his board interview.

08:29.839 --> 08:32.159
-Kat, tell Tara I'm not dancing
for the board in a

08:32.200 --> 08:34.480
suit and tie.

08:34.519 --> 08:37.279
-So you and Lucy would have
spent a lot of time together

08:37.320 --> 08:39.399
in these very hallways?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.720
-How do you mean?

08:40.759 --> 08:43.240
-She was pretty hot to trot
back then, wasn't she?

08:43.279 --> 08:44.600
Her and Mom?

08:44.639 --> 08:45.559
I've seen the pictures.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.480
-Oh, you're Maive's daughter.

08:47.519 --> 08:48.279
Oh, Grace.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.799
I'm so sorry to hear about--

08:49.840 --> 08:50.399
-Thanks.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.200
I didn't know her.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.440
So Lucy's something else, huh?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.399
I only hope Javier
appreciates.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.120
-Javier?

08:58.159 --> 08:59.279
-Don't get me wrong.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.360
He's handsome in a silver
fox kind of way.

09:02.399 --> 09:03.600
And, you know, there's
the whole mansion

09:03.639 --> 09:05.120
on the harbor thing.

09:05.159 --> 09:09.480
But, would you date someone
who didn't like ballet?

09:09.519 --> 09:10.639
-Hmm.

09:21.320 --> 09:24.399
to say, for a scholarship
student, they fluctuate rather

09:24.440 --> 09:25.799
alarmingly.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.360
-Well, dancing isn't
about exams for me.

09:28.399 --> 09:30.480
It never has been.

09:30.519 --> 09:33.639
-Perhaps you might start by
explaining why you decided not

09:33.679 --> 09:36.159
to come back at the
start of the year.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.080
-Oh, man.

09:38.120 --> 09:38.639
-I--

09:38.679 --> 09:40.720
I just--

09:40.759 --> 09:42.360
I couldn't.

09:42.399 --> 09:45.399
-The school has invested a
significant amount of time and

09:45.440 --> 09:46.600
money in you, Mr. Reed.

09:46.639 --> 09:47.360
I think we--

09:47.399 --> 09:48.600
we deserve more than that.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.480
-Christian's sick, and he has
suffered a terrible tragedy in

09:54.519 --> 09:55.600
the final semester.

09:55.639 --> 09:57.639
-We were all saddened
by the loss.

09:57.679 --> 10:00.799
But, um, if the other student
managed to come back on time--

10:00.840 --> 10:04.200
-Christian was particularly
close to Sammy Lieberman.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.399
But I'm sure he can better
articulate what he was going

10:06.440 --> 10:07.200
through.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.559
-Well, please, enlighten us.

10:17.639 --> 10:19.440
-Christian, wait.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.039
Didn't they want to
see you dance?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.399
-Can't you see how desperate
you look?

10:22.440 --> 10:24.279
I don't know how to make
it any clearer.

10:24.320 --> 10:34.320
I do not want to be
with you, OK/

10:34.360 --> 10:45.600
I do not want to be
with you, OK/

10:45.639 --> 10:46.720
-Hey, Nick.

10:46.759 --> 10:49.320
Um, sorry for my rapid
retreat yesterday.

10:49.360 --> 10:51.200
-It's OK.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.159
I have that effect
on people lately.

10:56.159 --> 10:57.320
-Peckish?

10:59.480 --> 11:02.799
So, I guess you're
living the life--

11:02.840 --> 11:06.320
a bit of study, taking
girls to lunch?

11:06.360 --> 11:07.799
-I thought you asked me?

11:07.840 --> 11:12.440
Well medicine's more than
a bit of study.

11:12.480 --> 11:13.679
-Sorry.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.480
I'm sure it's tough.

11:16.519 --> 11:17.600
-Whatever.

11:17.639 --> 11:21.039
You probably know
all about me.

11:21.080 --> 11:21.759
Oh, come on.

11:21.799 --> 11:22.639
You knew my name.

11:22.679 --> 11:23.720
You must have heard.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.720
-Heard what?

11:25.759 --> 11:28.200
-Forget it.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.039
It's not lunchtime
conversation.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.279
-You can tell me.

11:36.240 --> 11:41.799
-Um, last year, I was involved
in an accident.

11:41.840 --> 11:47.480
This kid, I hit him
with my car.

11:47.519 --> 11:50.480
I just assumed you were one of
those emo psychology girls who

11:50.519 --> 11:54.639
suddenly found me so much more
interesting afterwards.

11:54.679 --> 11:56.639
Anyway, the police finding
was that--

11:56.679 --> 11:59.399
that it was an accident, so I'm
not guilty or anything.

11:59.440 --> 11:59.759
But, it's--

11:59.799 --> 12:02.159
-Wow.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.360
It's all about you, isn't it?

12:05.559 --> 12:07.360
That kid?

12:07.399 --> 12:11.159
His name was Sammy Lieberman,
and, oh, gosh, I am so sorry

12:11.200 --> 12:12.159
he ruined your year.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.159
-You wrote the deposition.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.320
That's how I knew.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.799
How long have you been
following me for?

12:15.840 --> 12:16.559
-Don't worry.

12:16.600 --> 12:17.799
That's over.

12:19.759 --> 12:23.360
I just wanted to tell you know,
to tell you that you

12:23.399 --> 12:28.240
killed the best person
I have ever known.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.320
-The plan is in place.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.720
This little monster is gaga
for Gaga tonight.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.080
-So, anyway, I was thinking
that maybe we should have

12:42.120 --> 12:43.240
dinner while I'm here.

12:43.279 --> 12:45.759
I'd love to ask Javier about
his super yacht.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.120
-Who?

12:47.159 --> 12:48.519
-Did I pronounce it right?

12:48.559 --> 12:50.159
Um, Javier.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.519
Grace said he was Argentinian.

12:52.559 --> 12:53.519
-She'd know.

12:53.559 --> 12:55.000
Grace.

12:55.039 --> 12:58.200
-I'm trying to make you look
interesting, and it's working.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.159
So, go.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.679
Reel him in.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.320
-You expect to be treated like
an adult and then you persist

13:01.360 --> 13:02.679
with this nonsense.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.519
My private life is absolutely
none of your business.

13:05.559 --> 13:07.679
-What private life,
Miss Raine?

13:07.720 --> 13:09.799
I'm getting you one so you don't
have to leech the fun

13:09.840 --> 13:11.159
out of mine.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.279
-Don's sitting there,
haunting me.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.519
Do you want to get
out of here?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.159
-Why would I want
to be with him.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.279
I mean, sure.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.360
He did that whole half-baked
declaration

13:41.399 --> 13:42.360
thing last year, but--

13:42.399 --> 13:44.799
stop me if this gets
Christian weird.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.200
-Totally fine.

13:46.240 --> 13:49.320
-He seriously thinks I'm
clinging on to that.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.080
Do you want to come catch the
tiniest glimpse of me at the

13:51.120 --> 13:52.399
back of the corps?

13:52.440 --> 13:54.120
-Uh, I think I'm just going
to grab some couch time.

13:54.159 --> 13:56.559
-All's well in Katland?

13:56.600 --> 13:57.799
See ya.

14:33.679 --> 14:36.600
-I want to maximize the free
time, not control it.

14:36.639 --> 14:41.159
But it just sits there, looming,
hours on hours.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.159
[applause]

14:43.200 --> 14:45.360
-This is meant to be
a hip hop thing.

14:45.399 --> 14:47.600
It says right here.

14:47.639 --> 14:49.159
-Hi, kiddies.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.799
It's going to be a scintillating
night.

14:51.840 --> 14:56.080
-Penny Drop's Magical Mardi
Gras Cabaret Experience.

14:56.120 --> 15:00.679
-Now, all the way from
Twistbackastan, please pop

15:00.720 --> 15:04.639
your pedals up for the
lovely Lillith!

15:04.679 --> 15:06.200
-And we go.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.320
-Ah!

15:07.360 --> 15:09.320
I paid for you, and we
get a free entree.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.720
Don't stop now.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.639
-I'm sorry you didn't get to
go out with your friends.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.159
Marcus--

15:32.840 --> 15:35.399
he was my boyfriend all through
the Academy and then

15:35.440 --> 15:37.159
as well in the Company.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.080
-You crazy kids were in love?

15:41.120 --> 15:45.600
-But then he left, and
I-- well, I stayed.

15:45.639 --> 15:48.480
He had adventures, got married,
had children.

15:48.519 --> 15:50.480
-The swine.

15:50.519 --> 15:52.559
-When you started making up
stories to make me more

15:52.600 --> 15:56.159
interesting, you hit
a soft spot.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.840
-I wouldn't have done a
Javier if I'd known.

15:58.879 --> 15:59.600
-You're right.

15:59.639 --> 16:00.840
I could have told you.

16:00.879 --> 16:02.240
I--

16:02.279 --> 16:03.480
I know how to be a ballet
teacher in principle, but I

16:03.519 --> 16:05.240
don't know how to be--

16:05.279 --> 16:08.039
I'm not saying I see myself
as your mother.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.519
I would never presume.

16:09.559 --> 16:13.480
-I've never had a proper one, so
I wouldn't know if you were

16:13.519 --> 16:14.720
doing it wrong anyway.

16:18.799 --> 16:19.639
-No, no, no.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.600
No, Grace, hang up.

16:20.639 --> 16:21.120
-Stop.

16:21.159 --> 16:21.639
Stop it.

16:21.679 --> 16:22.120
-No, hang up.

16:22.159 --> 16:23.320
Hang up.

16:23.360 --> 16:25.480
Hello, Lucinda Raine.

16:25.519 --> 16:27.320
Oh, no, you're right, Marcus.

16:27.360 --> 16:28.559
I called you.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.639
-If this works, I
can go to Gaga.

16:30.679 --> 16:34.039
-Not a chance.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.679
-They were like vultures,
waiting for

16:36.720 --> 16:38.559
me to cry over Sammy.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.440
-Do the girls really find
this act so dreamy?

16:40.480 --> 16:42.399
-As if I'd use him like that.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.639
-Think you're honoring Sammy?

16:44.679 --> 16:48.840
You're exploiting his memory
as an excuse to drink.

16:48.879 --> 16:51.720
And, yes, I am aware that's
hypocritical.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.399
-Ooh, look at those pins.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.799
Don't tell me I've got a
dancer in the audience.

17:05.839 --> 17:06.400
-Guilty.

17:06.440 --> 17:06.799
[laughing]

17:06.839 --> 17:08.118
-Good.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.039
I'll have to tell Stefan you're
watching he needs to

17:11.079 --> 17:14.079
lift his game.

17:14.118 --> 17:16.200
Why is the ones with the natural
talent always end up

17:16.240 --> 17:18.279
so complacent?

17:18.319 --> 17:19.559
It's the ego, surely.

17:22.759 --> 17:26.598
Now, a little birdie told me
that there's a very special

17:26.640 --> 17:31.200
boy out there who's ready to
throw in the dance towel, but

17:31.240 --> 17:35.559
his friend wants to reignite
his passion flame.

17:35.599 --> 17:38.079
Where's Christian?

17:38.119 --> 17:39.759
Christian?

17:39.799 --> 17:41.119
Oh, Christian.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.480
Come on up.

17:42.519 --> 17:43.480
Don't be shy.

17:43.519 --> 17:44.640
Come on, everybody.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.480
Let's give him some Magical
Cabaret courage.

17:46.519 --> 17:47.680
[applause]

17:47.720 --> 17:50.799
-Christian, Christian,
Christian, Christian,

17:50.839 --> 17:52.319
Christian, Christian.

17:52.359 --> 17:53.680
Come on, love.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.079
Christian, Christian.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.440
-Woo!

17:59.480 --> 18:02.319
-(SINGING) He's in the room,
you stop and stare.

18:02.359 --> 18:05.839
He's a tease, hint of sleaze,
but a classy affair.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.480
It's a fact, what an act,
he's a rabid star.

18:09.519 --> 18:13.200
Get up, shake your butt,
baby, you've come far.

18:13.240 --> 18:17.319
There's nothing in the world he
hadn't done before, with a

18:17.359 --> 18:18.640
voice that is choice.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.559
Hey, could you ask for more?

18:20.599 --> 18:24.319
Appealing, revealing, the
dance floor's reeling.

18:24.359 --> 18:28.599
The boy really knows how to--

18:28.640 --> 18:31.599
I'm going to show you a diva.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.480
Let me show you a diva.

18:35.519 --> 18:39.720
I'm going to show you a diva.

18:39.759 --> 18:42.799
Come on, Christian.

18:42.839 --> 18:44.119
I think he's going
down the drain.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
He isn't exactly twinkletoes,
is he?

18:49.200 --> 18:50.160
Whoa!

18:50.200 --> 18:53.160
It's a Mardi Gras miracle!

19:00.200 --> 19:02.559
-(SINGING) I'm gonna
show you a--

19:02.599 --> 19:04.559
I'm gonna show you--

19:04.599 --> 19:08.559
make me show you a diva.

19:08.599 --> 19:16.519
Come on, come on, I'm gonna
show you a diva!

19:16.559 --> 19:19.079
I'm gonna show you a diva!

19:19.119 --> 19:21.039
[applause]

19:39.240 --> 19:41.400
-It's late, and you had
an early start.

19:45.799 --> 19:47.160
-(WHISPERING) Christian!

19:49.759 --> 19:51.079
-What is she doing?

20:15.759 --> 20:16.240
-OK.

20:16.279 --> 20:17.680
Donation chart.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.160
Everyone's been chipping in,
just in case his scholarship

20:20.200 --> 20:22.359
doesn't come through.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.480
-It's at $76.

20:24.519 --> 20:28.640
-Wait until the learning to
drive slash bikini car wash.

20:28.680 --> 20:30.160
-This is--

20:30.200 --> 20:30.720
you guys didn't need to--

20:30.759 --> 20:32.400
-Look.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.480
We already lost one
to mate last year.

20:34.519 --> 20:35.799
We've missed you, Reed-o.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.160
What do you want?

20:41.200 --> 20:43.359
-Ohh, eggs and bacon.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.559
-Bacon and eggs?

20:55.440 --> 20:57.640
-I haven't been stalking you.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.680
After the hearing, I had
to know what sort

21:00.720 --> 21:02.039
of person you were.

21:04.599 --> 21:09.359
-Once they told me it wasn't my
fault, then if Sammy wasn't

21:09.400 --> 21:12.799
real-- like if--

21:12.839 --> 21:20.119
if I didn't know his friends
or family, somehow I could

21:20.160 --> 21:22.160
live with ti.

21:22.200 --> 21:22.759
-How do you?

21:22.799 --> 21:24.839
-I don't.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.200
I don't live with it.

21:30.839 --> 21:34.160
I think I just--

21:34.200 --> 21:37.839
I show people what they
want to see, you know?

21:37.880 --> 21:46.519
Like my parents, they want it
to be over and OK, so I

21:46.559 --> 21:47.720
pretend like it is.

21:50.480 --> 21:53.079
-I've been hating the guy who
killed Sammy ever since it

21:53.119 --> 21:53.599
happened.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.160
-And you should.

21:56.200 --> 21:57.359
You should hate me.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.200
I am so sorry.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.319
KAT NARRATING: So, staying
positive--

22:14.359 --> 22:15.799
how long do I have
to keep that up?

22:15.839 --> 22:19.680
Because amazing seems
like a fair way off.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.039
-Thanks for seeing me again.

22:21.079 --> 22:23.319
I really appreciate your time.

22:23.359 --> 22:26.480
KAT NARRATING: I'm at the
Academy with my friends.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.359
I have this second chance
to get my life right.

23:07.839 --> 23:09.480
-Gory details over lunch?

23:09.519 --> 23:11.200
-Oh, I've already
promised Marcus.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.119
Next time.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.759
Oh.

23:13.799 --> 23:15.400
KAT NARRATING: Everyone's always
said that if I just

23:15.440 --> 23:18.119
stopped messing around--

23:18.160 --> 23:19.440
suck it up, Kat.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.599
Keep smiling.

23:20.640 --> 23:24.279
It's the one thing you're
truly good at.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.160
I worked hard on Marcus's
assignment, but I didn't end

23:27.200 --> 23:28.319
up using Nick as the subject.

23:31.240 --> 23:32.400
Instead, I chose a stranger--

23:36.640 --> 23:41.480
someone I'm only starting to
figure out, someone I'm a

23:41.519 --> 23:43.799
little scared of--

23:43.839 --> 23:45.160
me.
