00:29.765 --> 00:33.166
Come on, Jake.
- Slow down!

00:33.235 --> 00:36.261
Hurry up, Jake!
- Melanie!

00:36.338 --> 00:39.739
I gotta get home.
My mom's gonna kill me.

00:39.808 --> 00:41.332
Wow, did you see that?

00:41.409 --> 00:45.003
1,001... 1,002...

00:45.079 --> 00:47.445
Well, answer the question!
- No!

00:47.515 --> 00:50.382
No, you won't answer,
or no, you won't marry me?

00:50.451 --> 00:54.016
Jake Perry, I'm 10 years old.
I got too much to live for.

00:56.090 --> 01:00.322
Not that way, you dolt!
Come on!

01:07.433 --> 01:11.400
It's hot. Don't touch it.
We'll be safe here.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.833
Says who?
- Everybody.

01:14.107 --> 01:19.170
Lightning never strikes
the same place twice.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.311
Why would you want to
marry me for anyhow?

01:24.416 --> 01:26.714
So I can kiss you
any time I want.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.380
I need more coffee, guys.

02:02.453 --> 02:04.284
I'm gonna switch...
It's a warning!

02:04.355 --> 02:06.584
Oh, my God.

02:13.663 --> 02:14.994
You know, that accent of yours...

02:15.065 --> 02:16.623
is a whole lot thicker
when you're dreaming.

02:18.501 --> 02:20.401
All right, how come
y'all let me sleep?

02:20.470 --> 02:22.233
Oh, calm down.
It was 5 minutes.

02:22.305 --> 02:24.102
What did I say?

02:24.174 --> 02:26.641
We're all getting big, fat
raises when you become somebody.

02:28.177 --> 02:30.941
Oh, did they kill Badgley Mishka!

02:31.013 --> 02:33.106
Okay, laugh now, but
tomorrow it could be us.

02:33.182 --> 02:35.980
Not us... you.
I just make the coffee.

02:36.051 --> 02:37.712
Thank you.

02:46.060 --> 02:48.620
I'll see you at the show.

02:48.696 --> 02:51.494
Bye, Mel.

04:02.801 --> 04:05.736
There's a rose for every moment
I thought of you last night.

04:05.804 --> 04:07.135
God, you must be exhausted.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.695
Listen, knock 'em dead.
I'll see you at the show.

04:09.773 --> 04:11.206
It's gonna be great.

04:11.275 --> 04:12.207
I love you.

04:12.276 --> 04:13.743
I can't wait to see you.
Goodbye.

04:24.121 --> 04:27.386
Okay, people,
we are officially late!

04:27.458 --> 04:29.719
Melanie!
- Yes?!

04:29.826 --> 04:32.090
This top is supposed
to be neon aubergine,...

04:32.161 --> 04:34.220
but it's all wrong!
It's all wrong!

04:34.297 --> 04:36.162
Okay, don't panic.
That's my job.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.132
Um... okay.
Put her on after Anoke.

04:38.201 --> 04:40.897
The third light cue is yellow.
She'll look eggplant.

04:40.970 --> 04:44.269
Pan, uh, the reason it's all
wrong is it's on backwards.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.274
Ooh, Miss Vixen, I'm scared of you.

04:46.342 --> 04:49.368
Frederick, what are you doing
here? You're the competition.

04:49.445 --> 04:52.379
Competition? Please! Our
design's for plumes and pearls,...

04:52.447 --> 04:55.143
and nothing is going to come
between me and my protege.

04:55.217 --> 04:57.412
And this is, after all,
all about me.

04:57.486 --> 05:00.785
Oh, I love this. Stella
McCartney's gonna kill herself.

05:00.856 --> 05:03.689
Then why do I feel like
I'm in Times Square buck naked?

05:03.759 --> 05:05.659
Baby doll, you're
gonna be just fine.

05:05.727 --> 05:08.389
Seven years ago, you were this
debutante off the plantation,...

05:08.463 --> 05:11.992
and now you're my steel magnolia
with her very own show.

05:12.166 --> 05:14.532
Okay, get out of here
before you make me cry.

05:15.669 --> 05:16.863
Bonne chance!

05:21.609 --> 05:24.339
Big smile!
Great! Thank you!

05:28.149 --> 05:29.209
Good to see you.

05:29.383 --> 05:32.746
Secretary Hennings, do you have
a moment for a few questions?

05:32.952 --> 05:35.216
Andrew, are you excited
about the show?

05:35.288 --> 05:37.313
Uh, of course,
I'm very excited.

05:37.390 --> 05:40.715
Did you get to see the models?
- The models? Why, uh...

05:40.927 --> 05:42.986
Please tell me
he has a flaw somewhere.

05:43.063 --> 05:46.430
He asked me to go to
Ireland for Christmas.

05:46.499 --> 05:49.525
He's gonna ask you
a lot more than that.

05:49.602 --> 05:51.661
You think so?

05:51.738 --> 05:53.204
Hey, let's go!
- Let's do this!

05:53.272 --> 05:56.002
All right, we gotta go.
- Places, everyone!

05:56.075 --> 05:57.667
Come on, let's go, line up.
- Have a good show.

05:57.743 --> 06:00.678
Okay, no smiles,
no smiles, just smirks!

06:23.701 --> 06:25.464
Oh, congratulations.

06:25.536 --> 06:28.334
You're amazing.
Those flowers were insane.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.203
Oh, well, I just want
this day to be perfect.

06:30.274 --> 06:31.866
Oh, God, honey,
what if they hate me?

06:31.943 --> 06:34.001
Oh, they're critics, Mel.
They hate themselves.

06:34.077 --> 06:35.339
That's easy for you to say.

06:35.412 --> 06:37.039
I wasn't born with
that thick Hennings skin.

06:37.114 --> 06:39.981
No, you weren't, and that
is what I love about you.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.452
Ah, honey, I'm sorry, I got
a meeting in the Bronx.

06:43.520 --> 06:45.954
But you go and enjoy, and
I'll see you later. Okay?

06:46.022 --> 06:48.616
Oh, and, hey, we've got that
thing tonight at Lincoln Center.

06:48.692 --> 06:50.284
What thing?

06:50.360 --> 06:51.918
Fund-raiser thing.

06:51.995 --> 06:55.361
Right, the thing...
with your mother.

06:55.431 --> 06:56.728
That's tonight.

06:56.799 --> 06:58.027
I'm afraid so.

06:59.101 --> 07:01.535
I am so proud of you.

07:01.604 --> 07:04.004
Thank you.

07:04.073 --> 07:05.131
Okay?
- I love you.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.834
I love you, too.
Congratulations.

07:26.294 --> 07:27.818
His meeting's running
a little late.

07:27.896 --> 07:30.592
He told me to take you inside
so you wouldn't have to wait.

07:30.665 --> 07:31.927
Where are we?

07:36.170 --> 07:38.161
I'm so tired, Jimmy.

07:38.238 --> 07:39.603
I've just had it.

07:39.673 --> 07:43.040
Well... he shouldn't be
too long.

07:43.110 --> 07:45.943
Miss Carmichael,
won't you come in?

07:54.755 --> 07:59.048
So... have you made a decision?
- About what?

07:59.192 --> 08:00.454
Ireland.

08:00.526 --> 08:04.553
Ireland, honey,
that's four months from now.

08:04.964 --> 08:08.800
I was thinking maybe
2... 300 guests, tops.

08:09.002 --> 08:10.469
For Christmas?

08:10.537 --> 08:13.764
Andrew, are you on
some sort of medication?

08:14.140 --> 08:17.534
What's going on?
Where are we?

08:37.328 --> 08:39.320
Oh, my God.

08:51.075 --> 08:52.741
Melanie Carmichael...

08:53.511 --> 08:55.638
will you marry me?

08:57.415 --> 08:58.847
Are you sure?

08:58.915 --> 09:01.509
I mean, a-a-are you really sure?

09:01.585 --> 09:03.519
Because if you're not sure, we
could just go back to the car.

09:03.587 --> 09:05.179
It's only been 8 months.

09:05.255 --> 09:07.052
You know I never do
anything rash.

09:07.124 --> 09:10.792
And I usually never ask a question
I don't already know the answer to,...

09:10.927 --> 09:17.323
so... at the risk of being rejected
twice, I'm gonna ask you again.

09:21.037 --> 09:23.164
Will you marry me?

09:25.641 --> 09:27.370
Yes!

09:35.084 --> 09:37.177
Pick one.

09:53.434 --> 09:54.731
Mayor, just one shot!
One shot!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.270
Can you comment on
the Watson bill?

09:56.337 --> 09:57.770
Over here, Mayor, please!
Over here!

09:57.839 --> 10:00.398
Thank you.
- Where is he?

10:00.474 --> 10:01.702
He's running late.

10:01.775 --> 10:03.436
No doubt thanks to
that Carbuncle girl.

10:03.510 --> 10:06.109
Carmichael... designer, Southern.
- Right, whatever.

10:09.216 --> 10:10.915
Your Honor,
how do you answer those...

10:10.984 --> 10:12.849
who are opposed to the
street-improvement project...

10:12.920 --> 10:14.478
you put before
the city council today?

10:14.555 --> 10:17.422
I suggest they take a drive on
some of the streets in Brooklyn.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.358
Maybe they'll disappear
into a pothole.

10:20.427 --> 10:22.986
Your son's relationship
with Melanie Carmichael...

10:23.062 --> 10:25.587
sources say they're engaged.
Do you have a comment?

10:25.665 --> 10:29.533
Trust me, if my son were
engaged, I'd have a comment.

10:31.938 --> 10:33.599
I thought you were tired.

10:33.673 --> 10:36.335
Jimmy, can you excuse us
for a second?

10:39.579 --> 10:41.171
I've been planning
this for weeks.

10:41.246 --> 10:44.272
I knew your show would be great,
and tonight is perfect.

10:44.349 --> 10:47.318
Oh, God, I can't wait to see
the look on my mother's face.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.613
Come on, let's call your parents.
- No!

10:50.689 --> 10:53.786
I mean...
not right this second.

10:55.193 --> 10:56.251
What I mean is, uh...

10:56.328 --> 10:57.920
Honey, would you mind terribly...

10:57.996 --> 11:00.430
if we just kept this to
ourselves for a few days?

11:00.498 --> 11:03.728
Mel, it's gonna come out
sooner or later.

11:03.801 --> 11:05.826
No, I know, I know, but, um,...

11:05.903 --> 11:08.337
it's just, I haven't seen
my folks in about 7 years,...

11:08.405 --> 11:12.774
and I just feel like I should
probably tell them in person.

11:12.843 --> 11:14.140
Of course.

11:15.679 --> 11:19.809
And, um... I think
I should do it alone.

11:19.884 --> 11:22.579
Mel, I'm gonna have to
meet them eventually.

11:22.652 --> 11:25.314
I know, I know, and
they will love you...

11:25.388 --> 11:26.480
eventually.

11:29.058 --> 11:33.958
Is it because I'm a Yankee?
- Well, that... and a Democrat.

11:38.501 --> 11:40.628
Okay... mum's the word.

11:40.703 --> 11:43.069
No one will know.
- Thank you.

11:46.642 --> 11:49.736
Secretary Hennings,
will you comment...

11:53.348 --> 11:54.713
Hello.

11:57.819 --> 12:00.014
Why haven't you told your
mother you're engaged?

12:00.088 --> 12:01.646
Have you thought about children?

12:02.791 --> 12:04.690
I'm sorry we're late.

12:04.759 --> 12:07.455
That shade of lipstick does
nothing for you. What kept you?

12:07.528 --> 12:09.018
Oh, it's none of your business.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.121
Ah, you know I hate surprises.
What's going on?

12:11.198 --> 12:13.666
Oh, Tom, always a pleasure.
Good to see you.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.463
Melanie, darling.
- Hi, Your Honor.

12:15.536 --> 12:16.798
So good to see you.

12:16.871 --> 12:19.431
Look at you... always
the belle of the ball.

12:19.507 --> 12:21.498
I hear very good things
about your new line.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.936
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
- Always a pleasure.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.013
Andrew?
- Yes?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.903
Seems Melanie is wearing a skating rink
on a very important finger.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.957
Um, Your Honor, I'd
really like to keep it...

12:38.024 --> 12:40.458
Oh, my God, you're engaged?!

12:42.929 --> 12:44.123
Quiet.

12:59.311 --> 13:02.007
Bloody hell, Mel,
I'm your first New York friend,

13:02.081 --> 13:04.709
and I have to read about it
with 12 million other people!

13:04.783 --> 13:06.750
Sorry, honey,
she just grabbed my hand.

13:06.818 --> 13:08.080
What was I supposed to do?

13:08.152 --> 13:09.585
I know...
we read all about it.

13:09.654 --> 13:11.383
So, did you cry?
- Wouldn't you?

13:11.456 --> 13:13.856
One man for the rest of my life?
I'd bawl my bloody eyes out.

13:13.925 --> 13:16.416
So why don't you meet us?
We're just around the corner.

13:16.494 --> 13:21.254
Can't.
I'm in Alabama.

13:21.332 --> 13:25.029
Oh... my God.

14:47.381 --> 14:49.905
He's loud, but he don't bite.

14:49.982 --> 14:52.472
Come on, shut up, hound!
Lie down.

14:52.652 --> 14:54.847
Go on, stay.

14:54.921 --> 14:57.185
Now, how can I help you?

14:57.256 --> 15:00.350
Well, for starters, you can get
your stubborn ass down here...

15:00.426 --> 15:01.859
and give me a divorce.

15:06.933 --> 15:09.994
Come on, Jake, I mean it.
The joke's over.

15:10.102 --> 15:11.967
Let's just finish this.
I've got a plane to catch.

15:15.474 --> 15:17.271
You're shittin' me, right?

15:17.342 --> 15:19.867
You know, I've never actually
understood that expression,...

15:19.945 --> 15:21.845
but, no,
I'm not "shitting" you.

15:21.913 --> 15:26.414
Look, it's even got these idiot-proof
tabs to make it easy.

15:26.551 --> 15:28.746
There's one copy for me,
one copy for you...

15:28.820 --> 15:30.549
and one copy for the lawyers.

15:35.926 --> 15:37.154
What? Speak!

15:38.229 --> 15:41.824
You show up here after 7 years...

15:41.899 --> 15:47.335
without so much as a "Hey, there,
Jake, remember me... your wife?"

15:47.638 --> 15:50.698
Or a "Hi, honey.
Lookin' good.

15:50.774 --> 15:52.741
How's the family?"

15:52.809 --> 15:54.640
You expect me to tell you
you look good?

15:54.711 --> 15:57.077
Did they run out of soap down at
the Piggly Wiggly since I left?

15:58.281 --> 16:00.977
They laugh at that up north
or wherever it is you been?

16:01.050 --> 16:02.711
You knew where I was.

16:02.785 --> 16:05.083
And don't even pretend you spent
all this time missing me.

16:05.155 --> 16:06.918
Oh, I missed you,
all right.

16:06.990 --> 16:09.652
But at this range,
my aim is bound to improve.

16:09.726 --> 16:11.717
Is that a threat?

16:11.794 --> 16:14.193
I've got a lawyer
who charges $350 an hour.

16:14.263 --> 16:17.027
He billed me every time
you sent these papers back.

16:17.099 --> 16:19.067
Well, I'm glad to see
you finally got the message.

16:19.134 --> 16:20.999
Shut up, Bear!
- Shut up, Bryant!

16:23.939 --> 16:28.772
What happened to Bear?
- He died.

16:29.411 --> 16:31.003
You weren't here.

16:32.414 --> 16:33.846
What are you doing?!

16:33.915 --> 16:37.614
Leavin'. You done it.
You should recognize the gesture.

16:37.785 --> 16:41.050
Could we just try to keep this
as civilized as possible?

16:41.122 --> 16:43.682
Please sign these papers
so I can go home.

16:43.758 --> 16:45.419
What do you know from home?

16:45.493 --> 16:48.428
Hell, I bet your folks don't
even know you're in town.

16:48.496 --> 16:50.088
That's my business.

16:50.164 --> 16:53.291
Honey, those people are
the only family you got.

16:53.366 --> 16:54.697
Don't you "honey" me, honey!

16:54.768 --> 16:57.931
Get your butt back in that car,
you drive over and see 'em,...

16:58.004 --> 17:00.598
and then maybe we'll talk.

17:01.875 --> 17:04.673
Jake! You dumb, stubborn,
redneck hick!

17:04.743 --> 17:08.308
The only reason you won't sign these
papers is 'cause I want you to!

17:08.381 --> 17:10.440
Wrong! The only reason
I ain't signin'...

17:10.517 --> 17:14.612
is 'cause you've turned into
some hoity-toity Yankee bitch...

17:14.686 --> 17:18.214
and I'd like nothin' better
right now than to piss you off!

17:31.971 --> 17:34.905
What are you doin' with
Mose Plydell's plane anyhow?!

17:34.973 --> 17:36.099
That's my business!

17:52.557 --> 17:55.548
Divorce, my ass.

18:11.942 --> 18:13.432
Hey, genius...

18:16.045 --> 18:18.240
Next time you lock somebody out,...

18:18.314 --> 18:21.306
make sure they don't know
where the spare key's hidden.

18:21.384 --> 18:25.320
Well, see, that's the thing
about Hide-A-Keys...

18:25.388 --> 18:29.324
it'd be nice if your wife
told you where it was!

18:29.392 --> 18:31.485
I'm not your wife, Jake.

18:31.560 --> 18:34.427
I'm just the first girl...

18:34.497 --> 18:36.522
that climbed
in the back of your truck.

18:38.233 --> 18:42.169
But you're right...
I have changed.

18:42.237 --> 18:44.797
I don't even know
that girl anymore.

18:44.873 --> 18:50.175
Well, then...
allow me to remind you.

18:59.720 --> 19:04.453
"Born into one of the wealthiest
families of Greenville, Alabama,

19:04.525 --> 19:08.188
her daddy's in cotton and
all that that implies."

19:08.262 --> 19:11.595
There's no listing for an
Earl Carmichael in Greenville.

19:11.665 --> 19:12.927
How about her local high school?

19:13.000 --> 19:16.231
No record of a Melanie
Carmichael attending... ever.

19:16.303 --> 19:20.261
Jesus! Whatever happened
to responsible journalism?

19:23.609 --> 19:25.941
There's something wrong here.

19:26.012 --> 19:28.776
Why would my son do this to me?

19:28.848 --> 19:30.816
Maybe he, um, loves her.

19:30.883 --> 19:33.941
Oh, please!
This is classic rebound.

19:34.020 --> 19:36.614
He's still wounded from...
who was his last girlfriend?

19:36.689 --> 19:39.418
Whitney Truesdale,
lawyer, San Francisco.

19:39.491 --> 19:41.823
Yeah, well, there was
a match made in Heaven...

19:41.893 --> 19:46.159
society, political family,
California...

19:46.231 --> 19:48.597
all those electoral votes.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.931
Get Andrew on the phone.

19:51.002 --> 19:54.460
Since we have a small window
for the Secretary of Housing,

19:54.539 --> 19:57.030
please hold your questions
until after the presentation.

19:57.109 --> 19:58.576
Gentlemen.

19:58.643 --> 20:00.303
Did you see the look
on my mom's face?

20:00.378 --> 20:01.970
I thought her head
was going to explode.

20:02.046 --> 20:03.343
Yeah, what did she say?

20:03.414 --> 20:05.314
That I should date women
like Melanie, not marry them.

20:05.383 --> 20:07.943
That's harsh.
- That's Mom.

20:08.018 --> 20:09.508
Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

20:09.587 --> 20:13.320
We hope to have the Bronx Children's Hospital
open by fall 2003.

20:13.391 --> 20:15.723
Oh, speak of the devil.
Hello?

20:15.793 --> 20:18.489
So, have you two lovebirds
set a date?

20:18.562 --> 20:20.028
I'm pleading the Fifth.

20:20.096 --> 20:22.326
Okay, fine, just try to keep
your secrets. I dare you.

20:22.399 --> 20:24.333
Oh, at least you sound like
you're in a better mood.

20:24.401 --> 20:26.198
My approval rating
went up 2 points.

20:26.269 --> 20:28.829
It seems the public likes
being reminded I am a mother.

20:28.905 --> 20:30.338
God, always running for office.

20:30.407 --> 20:33.604
I'm only thinking of you.
Say, um...

20:33.676 --> 20:38.570
do you happen to have the Carmichaels'
number down there in Greenville?

20:38.681 --> 20:41.478
I thought perhaps
I should introduce myself.

20:41.550 --> 20:43.643
I would like to meet them first,
if you don't mind.

20:43.719 --> 20:46.483
You do realize the press
is going to be all over this.

20:46.555 --> 20:48.284
Happy couples don't sell.

20:48.357 --> 20:51.884
So if there are any skeletons
in her closet, Andrew,...

20:51.960 --> 20:53.860
we need to know about them.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.027
You make clothes, right?

21:00.102 --> 21:02.865
I design them.
There's a big difference.

21:02.937 --> 21:05.337
Did you design anything
with stripes?

21:05.906 --> 21:08.307
You called the sheriff?!

21:08.376 --> 21:11.971
You know that old bastard
hates me!

21:12.046 --> 21:13.604
For good reason!

21:13.681 --> 21:18.118
Well, hell's bells, if
it ain't Felony Melanie.

21:18.186 --> 21:20.279
Wade!

21:20.354 --> 21:24.517
Hot damn, girl,
do we miss you around here!

21:24.591 --> 21:26.991
Hey, I think I saw poor, old
Fuzz just the other day.

21:27.060 --> 21:28.721
Oh, God,
you had to bring that up.

21:28.795 --> 21:30.490
I can't believe
you're the sheriff!

21:30.564 --> 21:32.532
Yep, I get to frisk pretty
little things like you all day...

21:32.599 --> 21:34.123
and get paid for it.

21:34.201 --> 21:36.066
Wade, can you try and be
a little more professional?

21:36.136 --> 21:37.626
We got us a crime suspect here.

21:37.704 --> 21:40.798
Now, Melanie, you can't just go
breaking into people's houses.

21:40.874 --> 21:43.899
I didn't break in, Wade.
I used a key...

21:43.976 --> 21:45.136
my key.

21:47.179 --> 21:50.408
Well, it still ain't your house, darlin'.
I'm gonna have to escort you out.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.246
Use the cuffs, Wade, please?

21:52.318 --> 21:55.481
If you get him to sign these,
I'll let you run me out of town.

21:55.554 --> 21:56.680
Now, that's none of your concern.

21:56.755 --> 21:58.313
Well, what do we got here?

22:01.227 --> 22:04.161
A bill of divorcement?

22:04.229 --> 22:06.254
Hell, boy, I thought you said
you took care of this.

22:06.331 --> 22:07.593
And I thought I had.

22:07.665 --> 22:09.064
Obviously not.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.363
Well, if you two are still
married, it's her house, too.

22:11.436 --> 22:14.030
This here ain't nothin'
but a domestic dispute.

22:14.105 --> 22:15.868
He didn't hit you, did he?

22:15.940 --> 22:18.909
If he took a swing at you,
I'll take him in right now.

22:18.977 --> 22:21.070
We take that stuff
pretty serious nowadays.

22:25.415 --> 22:28.441
No, Wade,
Jake's never hit me.

22:28.519 --> 22:30.714
You know what?

22:30.787 --> 22:35.192
I don't have a single childhood memory
that doesn't have you two in it.

22:35.292 --> 22:38.261
And that includes the night
I lit my ass on fire. Remember?

22:38.328 --> 22:39.260
Wade...

22:39.329 --> 22:42.196
Memory Lane is closed.

22:42.266 --> 22:45.894
Ah, boy, you two got a whole lot
of catchin' up to do...

22:45.968 --> 22:47.868
so I'm just gonna
leave you to it.

22:47.937 --> 22:49.700
Man, I set you up with
your wife. You owe me one!

22:49.772 --> 22:51.103
Why won't you just
sign the papers?!

22:51.173 --> 22:52.572
There is nothin' I can do.

22:52.642 --> 22:56.806
The law is the law,
and she has done nothin' wrong.

22:56.879 --> 22:59.404
I suppose shoplifting steaks
at Winn-Dixie's okay.

23:02.184 --> 23:03.776
I took 'em back,
and you know it!

23:03.853 --> 23:07.151
You remember that vandalism out
at the stockyard? Totally her!

23:07.222 --> 23:09.417
Like I could tip a cow
by myself.

23:10.859 --> 23:14.556
Wade... isn't there
some outstanding warrant

23:14.629 --> 23:17.325
for whoever dumped your mama's
tractor in the fishpond?

23:24.406 --> 23:26.464
We only have 10 of these, and
it's gonna be gone for good.

23:26.541 --> 23:28.668
So if you are loving
this monster...

23:31.546 --> 23:33.104
We have eight only?

23:33.181 --> 23:35.376
If I knew how to say that in
Italian, I would, but I don't.

23:35.450 --> 23:37.077
If you love this...

23:37.151 --> 23:40.314
9:15? Honestly.

23:40.388 --> 23:42.288
Who could be callin'
at this hour?

23:43.024 --> 23:44.651
Hello?

23:46.427 --> 23:48.485
Hey, Mama.

23:48.562 --> 23:50.689
Melanie? Is that you?

23:50.764 --> 23:52.732
Oh, it's so late.
Are you all right?

23:55.836 --> 23:57.770
I just thought
I'd surprise you.

23:57.838 --> 24:01.274
Well, this certainly is a fine
surprise, hearing from you...

24:01.341 --> 24:03.866
you know,
being such a busy girl and all.

24:03.944 --> 24:08.704
Of course, I call people while I'm
doin' the dishes or shellin' peas.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.874
Oprah calls it "multitasking."

24:11.951 --> 24:15.713
Mama, the call isn't the surprise.
I'm in town.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.187
Oh, Lord, love a duck!

24:18.257 --> 24:21.488
Oh, my baby girl
has finally come home.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.091
Earl, she's in town.
- You gonna repeat everything she says?

24:25.164 --> 24:27.359
If you are, get off my chair.
- Mama...

24:27.433 --> 24:29.093
I'm just sittin' here, is all.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.532
What happened to the sound?

24:30.602 --> 24:33.093
I turned it down
so I could hear the phone ring.

24:33.171 --> 24:35.366
Mama!
- What, are you a clairvoyant?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.465
It was so loud,
I couldn't hear myself think.

24:37.542 --> 24:40.807
They could have heard it
at Joe and Lurlynn's house.

24:40.879 --> 24:42.642
Hello?
- I only get 3 minutes.

24:42.714 --> 24:45.842
Oh, honey, you didn't need
to call, then. Just come on by.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.044
Well, that's the thing.

24:48.119 --> 24:51.485
I was sorta hoping
Daddy could come get me.

24:54.591 --> 25:00.124
So, what put you in jail this time?
- Jake and his big, fat mouth.

25:00.464 --> 25:03.524
It's just a misunderstanding,
that's all.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.659
Yeah, kinda like that
weddin' I paid for, huh?

25:05.736 --> 25:08.000
I would hardly call that
a wedding.

25:08.072 --> 25:09.368
Boy was nervous.

25:09.439 --> 25:12.670
He was still drunk
from the night before.

25:12.742 --> 25:15.875
Can you blame him?
- Yes, I can!

25:16.179 --> 25:18.340
I went to the reception
by myself with puke...

25:18.414 --> 25:21.440
all down my dress while he slept
it off in the Travelodge,...

25:21.517 --> 25:23.382
and you're still siding with that...

25:23.453 --> 25:25.478
I'm not sidin' with anybody.

25:26.723 --> 25:27.917
The boy's changed, is all.

25:27.990 --> 25:30.150
Can we just
not talk about Jake, okay?

25:30.225 --> 25:32.921
I know he's the son you never
had, but I'm your only daughter...

25:32.994 --> 25:36.054
and maybe you want to know
what's new with me.

25:36.131 --> 25:39.294
Okay, shoot.

25:39.368 --> 25:42.997
I met somebody...

25:43.071 --> 25:46.370
and he's quite a catch.

25:46.441 --> 25:49.706
He's really a great guy.

25:49.778 --> 25:52.940
And I'm happy... really.

25:56.951 --> 25:58.942
Come to Mama, sugar!

26:02.456 --> 26:06.483
Oh, good land of the livin',
you are skin and bones.

26:08.295 --> 26:10.559
Well, don't I get a smile?

26:10.631 --> 26:12.723
I know you got one
in there somewhere.

26:12.799 --> 26:15.632
Come on, come on, let's not
let all the bought air out.

26:21.374 --> 26:23.934
Well, are you hungry, sweetie?

26:24.010 --> 26:26.342
Do you want me to reheat you
some chicken-fried steak?

26:26.413 --> 26:27.903
Oh, no, Mama, I'm fine.

26:27.981 --> 26:29.312
Sweetie, you look tired.

26:29.382 --> 26:31.316
Are you tired?
Oh, you know what?

26:31.384 --> 26:34.113
Maybe it's the way
you're wearing your hair now.

26:37.089 --> 26:38.886
You guys have really done
a lot with the place.

26:38.957 --> 26:40.982
Lord, would you listen
to that accent?

26:41.059 --> 26:42.993
Why don't you sit
in my good chair?

26:43.061 --> 26:45.359
Now, your mama got me this
Christmas before last.

26:45.431 --> 26:48.195
Oh, you mean the one where you
were supposed to come visit me?

26:48.267 --> 26:51.668
I told you time and time again,
it just didn't suit.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.204
Let me... let me get
you those tickets.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.437
Sit down in it.
Sit down.

27:02.013 --> 27:03.844
Now, watch this.

27:07.718 --> 27:09.879
I mean, isn't that
quite the deal?

27:09.954 --> 27:11.285
There are hardly words.

27:11.355 --> 27:13.549
Now, how do I get
out of this thing?

27:15.892 --> 27:17.723
Oh, my God!

27:17.794 --> 27:20.558
Jake tell you
he's thinkin' of gettin' one?

27:20.630 --> 27:23.463
Oh, I see your priorities...

27:23.533 --> 27:25.194
Jake, jail, and then home.

27:25.268 --> 27:28.203
Mama, it was just unfinished
business, is all.

27:28.271 --> 27:31.035
Jake's doin' all right.
Boy's goin' places.

27:31.107 --> 27:33.507
Once upon a time,
you were goin' places, too.

27:33.577 --> 27:36.306
Here are your tickets.

27:36.378 --> 27:37.470
These were a gift.

27:37.546 --> 27:39.514
I'd rather you guys
just use them.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.918
You know what I can't understand
is how y'all will visit...

27:46.989 --> 27:49.219
every stupid battlefield
in the continental U.S.,...

27:49.291 --> 27:52.089
but you can't manage
to visit your only daughter.

27:52.161 --> 27:54.129
Well, the door swings
both ways, sweetie.

27:54.196 --> 27:57.358
Anyway, don't get me started on
the things I don't understand.

27:57.432 --> 27:58.694
Here we go.

27:58.766 --> 28:01.291
Your dream for me was to get out
of this place and be somebody.

28:01.369 --> 28:03.837
You shoved me in every beauty
pageant in the state.

28:03.905 --> 28:05.372
I'm just sayin', is all.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.772
What?! What are you
trying to say?!

28:07.842 --> 28:10.174
I mean, just tell me what
I can do to make you happy!

28:10.245 --> 28:11.872
Just make yourself happy, darlin'.

28:11.946 --> 28:14.540
Done.
We're there, all right?

28:14.616 --> 28:16.606
You know, I've really
made something of myself.

28:16.683 --> 28:19.379
I have a career. People
actually want to be me.

28:19.453 --> 28:22.581
And somebody loves me,
and I love him.

28:28.795 --> 28:32.162
Pearl, why don't you get us that
baloney cake out the icebox?

28:38.704 --> 28:41.798
Your mama's a complex woman.

28:42.074 --> 28:43.899
I'm going to bed.

28:47.313 --> 28:49.076
Good night, darlin'.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.244
But you know nothing about her.

28:56.322 --> 28:58.448
Are you even sure who she is?

28:58.523 --> 28:59.888
I love her, Mom.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.186
That's nice,
but you have to be careful.

29:01.259 --> 29:03.159
You and I are different.

29:03.228 --> 29:05.924
We're not better, not worse...
we're just different.

29:05.997 --> 29:07.931
We're in public life to serve,
and to serve...

29:07.999 --> 29:10.934
to the best of our abilities,
we have to set good examples.

29:11.002 --> 29:12.731
Do you have to control everything?

29:12.804 --> 29:15.364
I've put a hold on the Plaza
for the second weekend in June.

29:15.440 --> 29:17.101
That should give you
a nice, long engagement.

29:17.175 --> 29:20.473
We were thinking Christmas in Ireland.

29:22.846 --> 29:26.305
If you think I'm going to let some
girl talk you into getting married...

29:26.383 --> 29:28.248
She is not "some girl."
- ...any place but New York City.

29:28.319 --> 29:30.913
She's my fiancee, for Christ's sake.

29:33.991 --> 29:36.186
You are just like your father.

29:36.260 --> 29:40.958
One minute you're brilliant,
controlled, steadfast.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.923
The next you're throwing it all away
on some young piece of ass.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.535
Those are your issues, Mother.

29:49.606 --> 29:50.971
Not mine.

30:01.950 --> 30:04.248
Hold on.

30:04.319 --> 30:06.048
You know what? Uh...

30:06.121 --> 30:09.557
How long does
a contested divorce take?

30:09.625 --> 30:11.923
18 months?!

30:11.994 --> 30:15.054
Mr. Buford,
I don't have 18 months.

30:15.130 --> 30:17.758
I don't have 18 days.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.232
Okay, well, that's just
not gonna work for me.

30:22.269 --> 30:25.170
Don't see the likes of you
around these here parts much!

30:25.239 --> 30:27.070
Mr. Buford, that's not gonna work.

30:27.141 --> 30:30.338
Lady, you look like
sex on a stick in that...

30:30.411 --> 30:32.208
Frederick Montana getup!
- I have to call you back.

30:32.279 --> 30:34.042
Listen, bubba,
why don't you just kiss my...

30:35.549 --> 30:38.382
...ass!
Oh, my God!

30:38.452 --> 30:40.043
Get in the truck, there, missy,...

30:40.120 --> 30:42.520
'cause I don't do that sort
of thing on the street.

30:43.623 --> 30:46.057
I guess your mama raised you right.

30:46.126 --> 30:49.527
What is that?
Calvin Klein? That's very nice.

30:49.596 --> 30:51.894
Very good.
I better back off.

30:51.965 --> 30:54.798
Don't want to get you in trouble
with the little lady.

30:54.868 --> 30:57.359
There is a little lady,
isn't there?

30:57.437 --> 31:01.270
I can hardly afford me, much
less some high-maintenance babe.

31:01.340 --> 31:02.568
What about
Cindy What's-her-name?

31:02.641 --> 31:04.871
You guys were real hot
and heavy in high school.

31:04.943 --> 31:07.878
She's a women's softball coach
up in Nashville.

31:10.883 --> 31:13.477
Well, that explains some
lingering questions that I had...

31:13.552 --> 31:15.679
about a game of post office
we played one time.

31:18.090 --> 31:21.422
I guess we all have our little
secrets, don't we, Bobby Ray?

31:23.327 --> 31:25.295
Yeah, we sure do.

31:26.998 --> 31:29.796
'Course, I read about
yours on the Internet.

31:29.867 --> 31:31.266
What?!

31:31.335 --> 31:33.599
Oh, I know all about
the cocks in your henhouse.

31:33.671 --> 31:35.935
Oh, God!
Bobby Ray!

31:36.007 --> 31:37.565
You sure do know how
to make a girl blush.

31:37.642 --> 31:39.610
Well, I gotta get back
to the factory,...

31:39.677 --> 31:41.042
but are you in town
for a while?

31:41.112 --> 31:43.045
Oh, God, I hope not. No,
I'm just hitting the bank.

31:43.113 --> 31:45.741
Well, I better scram.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.078
Very funny.

31:47.150 --> 31:49.414
Been really good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

31:56.359 --> 31:58.452
How's your leg?

31:58.528 --> 32:01.156
Oh, it don't give me too much
trouble, Miss Melanie.

32:01.231 --> 32:04.199
Dorothea, I'm gonna
take my lunch.

32:09.338 --> 32:11.602
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

32:14.076 --> 32:15.338
Dorothea?!

32:15.411 --> 32:19.706
Oh, my God, you've...
- Lost 110 pounds, I know.

32:20.115 --> 32:25.513
Well... congratulations.
- Thanks.

32:25.887 --> 32:28.481
I noticed that you
don't have an ATM.

32:28.556 --> 32:30.547
Oh, them things.
Russ don't want to put one in...

32:30.625 --> 32:34.425
on account of you lose personal
contact with the customers.

32:34.496 --> 32:36.862
Yes, that would be tragic.

32:38.967 --> 32:42.300
Wade said you and Jake
had quite the reunion.

32:42.370 --> 32:44.599
But that's just
pillow talk talkin'.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.606
Are you and Wade...

32:47.674 --> 32:49.835
Goin' on three years.

32:49.910 --> 32:51.537
'Course,
it ain't Tiffany's.

32:51.612 --> 32:55.136
But then again, you can't believe
everything you hear on TV.

32:55.249 --> 32:59.013
I need to make a withdraw from my...
- Joint account?

32:59.046 --> 32:59.848
My what?

33:02.689 --> 33:03.883
with Jake.

33:03.957 --> 33:07.392
From what I hear,
y'all are still married.

33:09.762 --> 33:11.252
Why, yes.

33:13.266 --> 33:15.200
Yes, we are.

34:00.910 --> 34:04.539
Lookin' good.
How's the family?

34:06.016 --> 34:09.451
Cut the shit.
Where's my stuff?

34:09.518 --> 34:10.917
Now, what kind of wife
would I be...

34:10.985 --> 34:13.112
if I didn't pick up
after my husband?

34:14.188 --> 34:17.056
The kind that don't live here.

34:17.126 --> 34:19.253
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

34:19.328 --> 34:21.795
Where is the Hide-A-Key?!

34:21.864 --> 34:26.062
I had the sweetest chat with
Wade's mama about her tractor.

34:28.036 --> 34:30.266
Nice to see you got
your accent back.

34:30.338 --> 34:33.774
Oh, I stumbled across
a few things today.

34:33.841 --> 34:34.967
Holy shit!

34:35.043 --> 34:37.136
What happened to the stove?!

34:37.210 --> 34:42.543
And where are them little magnets
I had over here, huh?!

34:46.353 --> 34:49.049
What the hell is this...
chick food?

34:49.121 --> 34:52.751
Light beer... less calories.

34:52.826 --> 34:54.350
I tried to pick out
a new bed,...

34:54.428 --> 34:56.828
but have you been to
the Sit 'n Sleep lately?

34:56.897 --> 35:00.128
Yuck. I'll just have to order
something from New York.

35:00.200 --> 35:02.566
Whatever blows
your dress up, darlin'.

35:02.636 --> 35:05.127
You go right ahead
and spend your money.

35:05.205 --> 35:06.729
Oh, but, darlin'...

35:06.807 --> 35:08.967
I thought you said we should
think of it as...

35:09.041 --> 35:10.406
our money.

35:15.181 --> 35:18.849
Just a guess, but I'm thinking
the words "joint checking"...

35:18.918 --> 35:21.045
are flashing in your head
right now.

35:29.061 --> 35:30.493
How much did you take?

35:30.562 --> 35:32.325
All of it.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.796
Son of a bitch!

35:33.865 --> 35:36.766
You want a wife,
you got a wife.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.928
And what are you doing
with all that cash?

35:39.003 --> 35:40.994
Why don't you invest it?
Don't you know anything?!

35:41.072 --> 35:42.801
I know if you don't get out
of this house right now...

35:42.874 --> 35:45.308
Sign the papers, and
I'll give it all back.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.308
Fine!
- Fine!

35:46.377 --> 35:47.901
Give me the pen.

35:47.979 --> 35:52.005
Hold on. What are you doing
with all that cash saved up?

35:52.082 --> 35:53.845
And since when did you
quit the tire factory?

35:53.917 --> 35:55.885
You're not doing anything
illegal, are you, Jake?!

35:55.953 --> 35:58.183
Maybe I am. So what?

35:58.255 --> 35:59.745
I don't ask you about
your boyfriend,...

35:59.823 --> 36:02.485
you keep your nose
out of my life... deal?

36:06.563 --> 36:07.996
Who told you?

36:08.065 --> 36:12.194
Honey, just 'cause I talk slow
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

36:19.809 --> 36:21.640
Look, Jake...

36:21.711 --> 36:25.704
Nobody finds their soul mate
when they're 10 years old.

36:28.117 --> 36:31.552
Yeah, I guess.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.111
I mean, where's
the fun in that, right?

36:48.436 --> 36:51.064
I can't believe you kept
this thing all these years.

36:53.807 --> 36:56.935
Most people don't know that
lightning does that to sand.

36:57.011 --> 37:00.742
Oh, hey, Mel,
you know what?

37:02.016 --> 37:04.143
I just remembered
I got myself a hot date.

37:04.218 --> 37:06.812
You don't mind if I have
my lawyer take a look at these.

37:06.887 --> 37:07.945
What?!

37:08.022 --> 37:11.788
Hell, I'm just a
simple country boy.

37:11.859 --> 37:14.952
There's words in there
I can't even pronounce.

37:15.028 --> 37:17.622
You might be takin' me to
the cleaners for all I know.

37:17.697 --> 37:19.426
The cleaners? You?

37:19.499 --> 37:22.024
Say, what did this set
you back, anyhow?

37:22.101 --> 37:23.466
More than you make in a month.

37:23.536 --> 37:25.561
Just sign the damn papers!

37:28.908 --> 37:31.308
But...
thanks for stoppin' by.

37:33.679 --> 37:35.909
Oh! God.

37:58.202 --> 38:00.329
I love you, I love you,
I love you.

38:00.404 --> 38:03.863
Are you sitting down?
- Why? Bad news?

38:03.975 --> 38:06.705
Just picked up the "New York"
magazine, and I quote,

38:06.777 --> 38:08.335
"That cool breath
of fresh air...

38:08.412 --> 38:10.471
"blowing through the tents
at Fashion Week...

38:10.548 --> 38:14.279
"was the soon-to-be household
name of Melanie Carmichael.

38:14.352 --> 38:17.787
Fashion insiders have labeled
her 'the next big one."'

38:19.122 --> 38:22.523
Oh, my God, "the next big one"?

38:22.626 --> 38:26.357
Oh, God, honey, I needed that
almost as much as I need you.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.863
What is that noise?

38:29.432 --> 38:31.662
The sound of my past.

38:31.735 --> 38:32.827
Have fun.

38:32.902 --> 38:34.631
Okay, bye.

38:48.584 --> 38:51.018
Batten down the hatches, boys!

38:51.086 --> 38:53.020
Trouble done just walked
back into my life,...

38:53.088 --> 38:55.852
disguised as my favorite
daughter-in-law!

38:55.924 --> 39:00.360
Honey, drive that pretty face
over here and give me a hug!

39:00.428 --> 39:02.794
Soon-to-be ex-daughter-in-law.

39:03.364 --> 39:05.560
Who's the lucky guy?

39:05.633 --> 39:07.157
His name is Andrew.

39:07.235 --> 39:08.634
He's in politics.

39:08.703 --> 39:10.796
Well, you got my vote.

39:10.872 --> 39:13.238
Good to see you, baby girl.

39:13.308 --> 39:15.538
Hey, you give this lady
whatever she wants.

39:15.610 --> 39:17.907
I'll catch up with you later.
- All right.

39:21.381 --> 39:25.317
I'll have a Gray Goose martini,
two olives, dirty. Thanks.

39:27.487 --> 39:30.183
Oh... my... God!

39:30.257 --> 39:34.720
Melanie?!
- Lurlynn?

39:34.828 --> 39:37.762
Yes! Oh, my God!

39:37.830 --> 39:39.593
Look at you, all fancy.

39:39.665 --> 39:42.725
You look like you just
stepped out of a magazine.

39:42.802 --> 39:46.738
Oh, well, thank you.
Um, look at you.

39:46.806 --> 39:48.433
You have a baby...

39:48.507 --> 39:49.940
in a bar.

39:50.009 --> 39:51.772
Hell, I got three
more at home.

39:51.844 --> 39:54.779
This one's still on the tit,
so I can cart him anywhere.

39:54.847 --> 39:57.213
Right.

39:57.283 --> 40:00.547
I almost bought that exact same
top the other day.

40:00.618 --> 40:05.721
But Clinton'd kill me if I spent
30 bucks on a sweater thing.

40:05.790 --> 40:09.692
That Jaclyn Smith
knows what she's doin'.

40:09.761 --> 40:11.558
Actually, it's mine.

40:11.629 --> 40:14.120
Bergdorf's just picked it up.

40:17.535 --> 40:19.297
I design clothes now.

40:19.370 --> 40:22.271
Oh, mmm, now that
you mention it,...

40:22.339 --> 40:25.604
I'm... I'm pretty sure
I heard that.

40:25.876 --> 40:27.735
So, do you know Jaclyn Smith?

40:32.316 --> 40:34.045
Mind if I join you?

40:35.719 --> 40:37.152
Actually, we do.

40:37.221 --> 40:39.121
You must be Jake's hot date.

40:39.189 --> 40:40.621
I'm Starr.

40:40.690 --> 40:43.352
Hi, I'm Melanie, Jake's
snotty Yankee-bitch wife,...

40:43.426 --> 40:47.224
whom he refuses to divorce, even
though I'm engaged to another man.

40:47.296 --> 40:49.594
Hot dog, Jake, look at
the size of that thing.

40:49.665 --> 40:50.764
Honey?

40:51.134 --> 40:53.830
Why don't you get us
a couple drinks, all right?

40:57.240 --> 41:00.231
Is that a martini?

41:00.308 --> 41:05.644
Not "me and her" us.
"You and I" us.

41:15.123 --> 41:17.023
Why do you make me
be mean to you?

41:17.092 --> 41:18.354
Is that what you want...

41:18.427 --> 41:21.020
to be humiliated in front
of all of your friends?

41:21.095 --> 41:24.087
Oh, come on, Mel,
we were your friends, too.

41:25.399 --> 41:28.163
Well, looky, looky there!

41:29.703 --> 41:32.536
If it isn't the two
groomsmen of the apocalypse.

41:34.708 --> 41:36.972
Hey, Eldon!
- Yep?

41:37.044 --> 41:38.944
Are you hungry?!

41:39.013 --> 41:40.571
Starved!

41:40.648 --> 41:42.672
No, no, no!
No, don't you dare!

41:42.749 --> 41:44.649
I could use a Melanie sandwich!

41:44.717 --> 41:47.550
Just seems like old times,
doesn't it?

41:47.620 --> 41:48.678
Get off me!

41:50.056 --> 41:53.287
No, not like old times, all right?

41:53.359 --> 41:55.156
Times have changed.

41:55.228 --> 41:58.095
No more Melanie sandwich,
no more Melanie taco,...

41:58.164 --> 42:00.564
and no more Melanie
corn dog, all right?

42:00.633 --> 42:02.691
Sure... sorry.
- Just playin' with you.

42:02.768 --> 42:03.962
Come on, guys,
just grab a stick.

42:04.036 --> 42:05.162
Let's play some pool, all right?

42:05.237 --> 42:08.365
And if you can't find a cue, just
pull the one shoved up her ass.

42:15.547 --> 42:19.313
Eldon, you're still wearing
that same old stupid hat.

42:19.384 --> 42:21.682
Well, I... just about
got it broken in.

42:21.753 --> 42:23.982
Now, you sit your
bony ass down there...

42:24.055 --> 42:27.890
and watch and see me teach Jake
here, how to lose at pool.

42:29.460 --> 42:31.052
Well, see, that's the thing.

42:31.128 --> 42:33.688
I'm not really a watch-and-see
kind of girl...

42:33.764 --> 42:35.356
am I, Jake?

42:44.040 --> 42:48.067
Come on, now,
Bobby Ray, you got it.

42:52.682 --> 42:56.516
Don't blow this one, okay?

42:56.586 --> 42:57.780
All right, baby?

42:57.854 --> 42:59.788
You can take the girl
out of the honky-tonk,...

42:59.856 --> 43:02.381
but you can't take the
honky-tonk out of the girl.

43:04.360 --> 43:10.350
So, Jake... are you going to
divorce this girl or what?

43:10.933 --> 43:14.391
Well, she waited 7 years.

43:14.470 --> 43:17.371
A couple more days
won't kill her...

43:17.439 --> 43:18.599
unfortunately.

43:18.674 --> 43:20.869
Like it's gonna
make a difference.

43:20.943 --> 43:22.342
You never know.

43:22.411 --> 43:24.709
You might be interested to learn
Jake has this whole...

43:24.779 --> 43:28.078
Hey, hey, let her think
whatever she wants, Clinton.

43:28.149 --> 43:31.050
She made up her mind
about me a long time ago.

43:31.119 --> 43:32.746
Some things never change.

43:34.355 --> 43:36.152
Like Eldon here!

43:36.224 --> 43:39.216
He never could get
his balls in the right pocket.

43:40.895 --> 43:43.796
Okay, Jake,
it's you and Mel.

43:43.865 --> 43:45.093
Clutch time, man.

43:45.166 --> 43:46.928
It's just like state playoffs.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.592
We're down by 6,
7 seconds to go.

43:48.669 --> 43:52.298
We need that big, beautiful
52-yard bomb!

43:55.742 --> 43:59.210
Do you remember that, Mel?
- How could I forget?

43:59.346 --> 44:02.509
That was the night
Jake got me pregnant.

44:03.917 --> 44:06.646
Why don't you just go
public with that shit?

44:06.719 --> 44:08.016
Oh, come on.

44:08.087 --> 44:11.853
It's not like anybody can
keep a secret around here...

44:11.924 --> 44:13.551
except for Bobby Ray.

44:13.626 --> 44:16.151
Now, what did I
ever do to you?

44:16.228 --> 44:18.628
You never did anything
to me, darlin'...

44:18.698 --> 44:20.632
or any other girl in town.

44:21.767 --> 44:24.327
Melanie, what is
the matter with you?

44:24.403 --> 44:27.132
What do you mean?
- Oh, she's just unhappy.

44:27.205 --> 44:28.729
Well, of course,
I would be, too,...

44:28.807 --> 44:31.139
if "Women's Wear Daily"
called me "less than mediocre."

44:34.446 --> 44:37.176
Why don't you just
go to a gay bar?!

44:40.198 --> 44:43.815
Now, what would
"B" Ray do at a gay bar?

44:58.969 --> 45:01.062
I think I had about
enough fun for one night.

45:02.740 --> 45:05.300
Oh, come on,
I was just kidding.

45:05.376 --> 45:08.173
Hey, Stella!

45:08.244 --> 45:11.179
How 'bout another round of
drinks for my friends here?

45:11.247 --> 45:12.976
Honey, I think you've
had about enough.

45:16.219 --> 45:18.119
You know what?

45:18.187 --> 45:20.815
I think you're right.

45:20.890 --> 45:23.188
I have had enough.

45:23.259 --> 45:26.456
I mean, how do you people live
like this, anyway?

45:26.529 --> 45:28.690
All right, that's it,
that's it. Come on.

45:28.764 --> 45:31.733
Did you know that there's
a great, big world out there?

45:31.800 --> 45:36.701
It has absolutely nothin' to do with
chitlins or children or beer!

45:36.772 --> 45:39.263
I liked her better
when she was crazy.

45:40.876 --> 45:42.309
What makes you think
you can treat them...

45:42.378 --> 45:44.346
like somethin' you stepped in
in them fancy shoes, huh?!

45:44.413 --> 45:46.210
You asked for it!
- I asked for it?!

45:46.282 --> 45:48.216
You show up here,
you steal my money,...

45:48.284 --> 45:51.013
you rearrange my house, and
then you insult my friends,...

45:51.086 --> 45:52.986
actin' like you're
better than 'em!

45:53.054 --> 45:54.544
I am better than them!

45:54.622 --> 45:57.090
And you stole my pen!

45:57.158 --> 45:59.149
That's all that matters
to you, isn't it?

45:59.227 --> 46:00.592
Jake...
- The money...

46:00.662 --> 46:02.425
the labels, the shoes...

46:02.497 --> 46:03.464
you're pathetic!

46:03.531 --> 46:04.930
Oh, like you're
goin' places!

46:04.999 --> 46:06.694
Well, I am as soon as I
get my keys out of here.

46:06.768 --> 46:08.736
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't, Mel.

46:08.803 --> 46:10.667
Give me my purse!
- You want to kill yourself?

46:10.738 --> 46:12.831
You want to kill yourself,
you do it somewhere else.

46:12.906 --> 46:15.067
At least I'm doin'
somethin' with my life.

46:15.142 --> 46:16.939
So what if you can't
play football anymore?!

46:17.010 --> 46:18.409
Get a new dream!
- Get in the car.

46:18.479 --> 46:20.106
Get in the truck, Mel.
- I did.

46:20.180 --> 46:22.512
All right!

46:27.755 --> 46:31.087
So, I... guess
the date's over, huh?

46:31.157 --> 46:32.385
Do me a favor.

46:32.858 --> 46:34.221
Follow us home.

46:46.072 --> 46:48.040
Earl.

46:48.107 --> 46:50.735
Evening, Jake.

46:50.810 --> 46:51.901
Pearl.

46:51.977 --> 46:53.444
Jake.

47:31.649 --> 47:34.180
My battle's in the day and
runs on into tomorrow morning.

47:34.250 --> 47:35.911
Be still.
I can't fasten this.

47:35.985 --> 47:39.284
If we win, I might stick around
for old Billy's rabbit stew.

47:39.355 --> 47:40.686
If we lose, I'll be home.

47:40.757 --> 47:42.088
Tomorrow, then, sweetie.

47:42.158 --> 47:44.353
Now, listen, Pearl,
you go easy on her.

47:48.631 --> 47:49.893
There.

47:49.966 --> 47:53.424
Oh, we were wondering when
we were gonna see you.

47:55.537 --> 47:57.198
Christ Almighty, Daddy.

47:57.272 --> 48:00.264
How am I gonna explain you
in New York City?

48:00.342 --> 48:02.037
History's history.

48:02.110 --> 48:05.375
No use sweepin' it
under the rug.

48:08.116 --> 48:09.743
Wish me luck.

48:09.818 --> 48:12.082
Go get them Yankees.

48:13.488 --> 48:16.422
People need a passport
to come down here.

48:36.476 --> 48:39.377
Hey, Bryant, where is he?

48:47.420 --> 48:52.148
Come here. Come on, come on.
There you go, there you go.

48:52.292 --> 48:53.554
Look good? Come on!

48:53.627 --> 48:55.958
Bryant, Bryant,
come on! Come on!

48:57.496 --> 48:59.088
What's she doin' here, huh?

48:59.164 --> 49:02.600
I thought you'd be gone.

49:02.668 --> 49:03.930
Bryant, there you go, boy.

49:04.003 --> 49:05.732
I put the money back
in your account.

49:05.804 --> 49:06.998
There you go!

49:09.742 --> 49:10.902
Thanks.

49:10.976 --> 49:13.843
Saves me from bouncin'
a lot of checks.

49:16.048 --> 49:17.674
Can he swim?

49:17.749 --> 49:20.149
Doesn't look like it.

49:22.053 --> 49:25.716
I like what you did, though...
to the house.

49:25.790 --> 49:28.020
Should help it sell quicker.

49:28.092 --> 49:29.423
Are you movin'?

49:30.995 --> 49:35.862
Well... I been spendin' a lot of
my time up around Tuscaloosa, so...

49:38.702 --> 49:41.633
How deep is that water?
- About 8 feet.

49:46.743 --> 49:50.804
Look, Mel...
I signed your papers.

49:53.483 --> 49:57.541
Jake, I never meant to hurt you,
or anybody else, for that matter.

49:57.720 --> 50:02.512
And I just came out
here to say... thank you.

50:05.561 --> 50:08.621
You might want to find yourself
a place out of the way.

50:10.666 --> 50:11.997
You can't just leave!

50:13.736 --> 50:16.000
Sure I can.

50:16.072 --> 50:17.562
You want to come?

50:19.407 --> 50:20.499
Where you goin'?

50:25.647 --> 50:27.512
I want to show you somethin'.

50:30.518 --> 50:32.008
I can't.

50:33.955 --> 50:35.388
Can't or won't?

50:36.791 --> 50:38.088
Both.

50:38.159 --> 50:40.854
The girl I knew
used to be fearless.

50:40.928 --> 50:42.691
The girl you knew
didn't have a life.

50:42.763 --> 50:47.598
Well, I... guess you better
get on with it, then.

50:47.668 --> 50:48.999
Come on, Bryant!

50:51.071 --> 50:54.165
Come on, boy, get in here.

51:08.087 --> 51:10.681
Excuse me, do you know
Bobby Ray Bailey's address?

51:10.757 --> 51:13.521
813 Lafayette.

51:16.095 --> 51:20.425
You don't remember me, do you?
- Oh, I remember you just fine.

51:20.532 --> 51:23.729
You used to steal
catfish from my pond.

51:25.504 --> 51:31.195
Yes, sir. I did that.
I'm sorry.

51:33.578 --> 51:34.977
'Course, on the weekends,...

51:35.047 --> 51:38.016
Bobby Ray goes over to
the Carmichael plantation...

51:38.083 --> 51:39.675
visits with Colonel Murphy...

51:39.751 --> 51:41.684
it being tourist season and all.

51:41.752 --> 51:42.946
Thank you.

51:56.500 --> 51:59.435
Oh, hi!
I'm Melanie Carmi...

51:59.503 --> 52:03.666
Melanie Smooter.

52:03.740 --> 52:05.605
I'm... I'm here
to see Bobby Ray.

52:08.044 --> 52:10.410
If he's alive,
he's out back.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.243
Come on.

52:13.683 --> 52:16.618
They're out here somewhere.
Watch your step.

52:23.492 --> 52:24.618
Bobby Ray?

52:24.693 --> 52:26.684
Melanie?!

52:26.762 --> 52:28.286
Don't move!

52:36.105 --> 52:37.936
Hot damn!

52:38.006 --> 52:40.600
Hold your fire, sir.
I'll be right back.

52:45.012 --> 52:46.775
We weren't aimin' for ya,...

52:46.848 --> 52:49.248
but I doubt I would have
gone to your funeral.

52:52.019 --> 52:55.352
I guess I wouldn't blame you.

52:59.393 --> 53:02.556
Forgotten how beautiful
this place was.

53:02.630 --> 53:05.860
Guess it doesn't take much
to forget a lot of things.

53:05.932 --> 53:08.230
Bobby Ray,
it's not like that.

53:08.301 --> 53:10.792
You know what? I'll tell
you what it's not like.

53:10.871 --> 53:14.500
It's not like Jake's the only
one that you run out on.

53:16.977 --> 53:19.138
I'm so sorry I outed you.

53:21.047 --> 53:23.709
I guess I figured
if I was pointing at you,...

53:23.783 --> 53:27.878
then... nobody would
see through me.

53:27.953 --> 53:32.253
Bobby Ray,
I can't find the fuse!

53:37.897 --> 53:40.491
I should go
before he kills himself.

53:48.139 --> 53:50.266
Bye.

54:02.087 --> 54:03.679
Afternoon.

54:03.756 --> 54:05.348
Can I help you?

54:05.424 --> 54:07.414
Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

54:07.492 --> 54:11.428
Ho-ho, boy,
am I glad to see you.

54:11.496 --> 54:12.861
I'll tell you, it's, uh...

54:12.930 --> 54:17.060
definitely, uh,
another world down here.

54:17.135 --> 54:18.727
Did you say the "Post"?

54:18.803 --> 54:22.170
Yes, I did. I was hoping to get an
interview with you and your family...

54:22.240 --> 54:25.038
maybe, um, a few pictures
if you don't mind?

54:25.109 --> 54:27.975
No.
I mean, uh, yes, I do...

54:28.044 --> 54:28.976
mind.

54:29.045 --> 54:30.273
They're not here.

54:32.582 --> 54:34.607
This is just
as you described it.

54:34.684 --> 54:38.484
It must have been amazing,
huh, growing up here?

54:38.555 --> 54:40.250
Like a fantasy.

54:40.323 --> 54:43.986
Would you mind if I take
a quick look inside?

54:44.060 --> 54:45.493
Actually, I'm on my way out.

54:45.562 --> 54:47.392
I'll come back, then.

54:47.463 --> 54:49.328
Uh, uh, okay,
but just a peek.

54:52.902 --> 54:55.268
This is it...
home sweet home.

54:56.639 --> 54:58.300
How old is this place?

54:59.742 --> 55:03.974
It was built by my, uh,
great-great-great-grandfather,...

55:04.046 --> 55:05.604
Charles Carmichael, in 1853.

55:05.681 --> 55:09.514
Oh, boy, I bet you slid down
this banister a time or two.

55:10.652 --> 55:14.816
And over here we have
the, um...

55:17.325 --> 55:19.759
kitchen, but who hasn't
seen one of those?

55:19.828 --> 55:20.920
Let's start over here.

55:35.843 --> 55:37.674
Now, this is my favorite room.

55:37.744 --> 55:42.704
It was part of the, um,
Underground Railroad.

55:42.783 --> 55:45.217
Why are we whispering?

55:45.285 --> 55:48.083
The whole place is haunted...

55:48.155 --> 55:53.421
by ghosts of, um,
the Civil War soldiers.

56:04.971 --> 56:09.067
Jake!
...buttons.

56:09.141 --> 56:11.700
No wonder we lost the war.

56:13.545 --> 56:16.070
Was that one of 'em?

56:16.147 --> 56:18.980
Melanie?

56:19.050 --> 56:21.644
What are you doin'
in a closet?

56:21.720 --> 56:24.188
Hi. Barry Lowenstein,
"New York Post."

56:24.256 --> 56:27.487
Miss Carmichael is just showing
me around the plantation.

56:29.728 --> 56:32.992
Uh, Mr. Lowenstein is writing
a piece on the family,

56:33.063 --> 56:36.294
you know, since I'm marrying
the mayor's son and all.

56:36.367 --> 56:38.995
I had no idea.
Isn't that something?

56:44.275 --> 56:47.244
Well, a plantation by any
other name is just a farm.

56:47.311 --> 56:49.643
But it does roll off the tongue
a little sweeter, doesn't it?

56:50.947 --> 56:54.940
Well, I do believe Miss Melanie
forgot her manners.

56:55.018 --> 56:57.851
I'm Bobby Ray... her cousin.

56:59.989 --> 57:01.388
Charmed.

57:04.527 --> 57:06.927
See, when the Yankees
marched through Alabama,...

57:06.996 --> 57:09.658
they tried to destroy
our metal-formin' capabilities...

57:09.732 --> 57:12.359
by placin' barrels of powder
underneath the anvils.

57:12.434 --> 57:14.231
Of course,
all that managed to do...

57:14.303 --> 57:16.430
was blow 'em sky-high
for a few seconds.

57:16.505 --> 57:19.099
So... in honor
of that act of stupidity,

57:19.174 --> 57:23.076
we all... we get together to
re-create it for the tourists.

57:32.687 --> 57:35.212
What the hell was that?!

57:36.290 --> 57:39.157
Hey, Grandpa!
This here's Barry!

57:39.226 --> 57:41.820
He's doin' an article
on Melanie's weddin'!

57:41.896 --> 57:44.922
Never heard of her.

57:53.340 --> 57:55.137
Thanks!

57:58.545 --> 58:02.777
Well, aren't you
just a big, fat liar.

58:02.849 --> 58:04.817
Bobby Ray!

58:04.884 --> 58:06.283
Oh, go back to New York.

58:56.433 --> 58:59.368
Hello.

58:59.436 --> 59:01.870
I'm sorry about what I said.

59:01.938 --> 59:03.235
Really sorry.

59:03.306 --> 59:05.501
Melanie, forget it.

59:05.575 --> 59:07.873
She was not sharing.

59:07.944 --> 59:11.175
Okay, y'all, you need
to eat and be quiet.

59:11.248 --> 59:13.045
We're gonna have us
a little visit.

59:27.229 --> 59:30.562
You know, he went up there.

59:30.633 --> 59:33.033
Who?

59:33.102 --> 59:35.832
Jake? When?

59:35.905 --> 59:39.101
About a year after you left.

59:39.174 --> 59:42.871
He doesn't know I know,
but Clinton let it slip once.

59:42.944 --> 59:44.434
Jake was in New York?

59:44.512 --> 59:46.412
He told Clinton he'd never
seen anything like it.

59:46.481 --> 59:48.176
He realized straight off...

59:48.249 --> 59:52.208
he'd need more than
an apology to win you back.

59:52.287 --> 59:56.053
He needed to conquer
the world first.

59:56.124 --> 59:57.920
He's been tryin' ever since.

59:57.991 --> 01:00:01.188
That's why he kept
sending the papers back.

01:00:03.564 --> 01:00:08.228
It's funny
how things don't work out.

01:00:09.303 --> 01:00:12.067
It's funny how they do.

01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:57.307
Hey, look who I found
hangin' out by the parkin' lot.

01:00:57.382 --> 01:00:58.815
Hesitant to join us.

01:01:01.085 --> 01:01:05.376
Anybody think of anything in here
that, uh, might bother Bobby Ray?

01:01:05.489 --> 01:01:08.151
Uh, Clinton's breath?

01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:11.895
You still the same Bobby Ray
from last night?

01:01:11.962 --> 01:01:14.123
Last time I checked,
yeah.

01:01:14.198 --> 01:01:17.531
Well, then, I'm gonna
buy you a drink.

01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:20.160
Well, you're really not
my type, I mean...

01:01:27.543 --> 01:01:30.205
Oh, honey, you...
you drink that from the top.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:33.772
I'm just lookin' to see who
makes this Deep South Glass.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.784
I wonder if you can get it
in New York.

01:01:35.852 --> 01:01:37.046
It's beautiful.

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:39.680
Hey, Jake,
Mel would like to know...

01:01:39.756 --> 01:01:43.623
where she can find some of
that snooty-faluty glass.

01:01:43.692 --> 01:01:45.159
Why ask me?

01:01:45.227 --> 01:01:47.195
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because you're...

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.624
You're all spiffed up
and... and all.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.362
Am I missin' somethin'?

01:01:55.436 --> 01:01:58.497
Let's show some respect.

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:11.184
When was the last time you
pushed me around the floor?

01:02:11.252 --> 01:02:13.311
Clinton here has got
two left feet.

01:02:13.387 --> 01:02:15.719
Well, Ms. Taylor,
I'd be honored.

01:02:15.790 --> 01:02:17.417
Let's do it. Come on.

01:02:17.491 --> 01:02:19.482
Come on, Mel,
get on out here!

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.518
Well, aren't you
the Lord of the Dance?

01:02:23.596 --> 01:02:27.088
I ain't as clumsy as I look.
She just can't keep time.

01:02:27.167 --> 01:02:29.397
You might have to
prove that to me.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:47.380
You know, he's pretty good.
It might be you.

01:02:47.453 --> 01:02:49.853
Oh, the hell you say.
Let me at him.

01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:56.427
Look at them two welded together.

01:02:56.495 --> 01:02:59.760
Why do they fight it?

01:03:01.867 --> 01:03:05.962
Maybe we could just talk.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.380
Come on, let's go
to the Roadhouse.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.292
What do you say we drive
out to Fairview and bowl?

01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:35.729
I don't think so.

01:03:35.799 --> 01:03:37.699
Do you want to go
harass somebody?

01:03:40.804 --> 01:03:43.102
Hey, I know this great
place where we can...

01:03:43.173 --> 01:03:44.162
No!

01:03:50.546 --> 01:03:54.346
Y'all, I think I'm gonna
call it a night.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:35.847
Hi, there, boy.

01:04:35.923 --> 01:04:38.824
Sorry it took me so long.

01:04:38.892 --> 01:04:42.953
I would have come sooner
if I'd known you were sick.

01:04:46.499 --> 01:04:50.833
Actually, that's
probably not true.

01:04:51.903 --> 01:04:55.067
I've been pretty selfish lately.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.640
Dogs don't know anything
about that, do they, though?

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:06.881
You were always
like a big old pillow.

01:05:10.822 --> 01:05:16.385
Like when everything
went pear-shaped...

01:05:16.961 --> 01:05:19.828
you never left my side.

01:05:25.604 --> 01:05:28.333
And then I just left you.

01:05:35.579 --> 01:05:39.709
I bet you sat there
wondering what you'd done wrong.

01:05:44.522 --> 01:05:47.457
I told him it was my fault.

01:05:51.628 --> 01:05:53.789
Quit bein' so nice.

01:05:53.863 --> 01:05:56.297
It's the truth.

01:05:56.366 --> 01:05:59.267
How come it has to be
so complicated?

01:05:59.335 --> 01:06:00.359
What?

01:06:00.436 --> 01:06:01.903
Truth...

01:06:03.971 --> 01:06:06.137
life...

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:08.077
this.

01:06:10.646 --> 01:06:12.739
He was one hell
of a good dog, wasn't he?

01:06:16.151 --> 01:06:20.679
You looked like you were
having fun out there tonight.

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:25.927
I'm happy in New York, Jake.

01:06:28.463 --> 01:06:34.489
But then I come down here
and... this fits, too.

01:06:34.569 --> 01:06:37.732
Since when does it have to be
one or the other?

01:06:37.805 --> 01:06:40.399
You can have roots
and wings, Mel.

01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.576
Maybe I could just fly south
for the winter.

01:06:49.584 --> 01:06:51.414
Look.

01:06:51.484 --> 01:06:53.281
What?

01:06:53.353 --> 01:06:55.321
There.
Do you see 'em?

01:07:01.695 --> 01:07:03.059
Only you.

01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:08.993
You know, I still go
out there sometimes.

01:07:11.203 --> 01:07:14.263
I see those big thunderheads
rollin' in.

01:07:15.941 --> 01:07:18.141
It's like a religion.

01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:21.971
I had a dream about it
the other night.

01:07:24.817 --> 01:07:26.978
You ever wonder
what would have happened...

01:07:27.052 --> 01:07:28.952
if we hadn't have gotten
pregnant?

01:07:29.021 --> 01:07:30.579
Jake...

01:07:30.656 --> 01:07:32.680
Just...

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:35.851
let me get this out
before I can't.

01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:39.823
I thought that baby
would be an adventure.

01:07:39.897 --> 01:07:43.663
And it took me a while
to realize...

01:07:43.735 --> 01:07:47.466
it would have been
your only adventure.

01:07:47.538 --> 01:07:50.632
I just guess Mother Nature
knew better, huh?

01:07:52.776 --> 01:07:55.711
I was so ashamed...

01:07:58.015 --> 01:08:02.008
'cause I felt...

01:08:02.085 --> 01:08:04.747
relieved.

01:08:07.257 --> 01:08:12.752
And all of a sudden, I just...
needed a different life.

01:08:15.898 --> 01:08:20.130
You done real well
for yourself.

01:08:20.202 --> 01:08:22.432
I'm proud of you, Mel.

01:08:24.273 --> 01:08:28.038
I'm just sorry I never danced
with you at our weddin'.

01:08:32.247 --> 01:08:36.081
I'm sure this next one's
gonna go better for ya.

01:08:41.356 --> 01:08:43.517
Jake, I can't do this.

01:08:48.997 --> 01:08:52.296
I know.

01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:19.952
Go home.

01:09:33.573 --> 01:09:35.063
Well, I'm just sayin',
is all.

01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:36.402
I mean, I... I saw

01:09:36.475 --> 01:09:38.238
the way you two
were lookin' at each other.

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:40.210
Will you just shut up
about it, Mama?!

01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:42.337
I can't help
the way Jake feels about me!

01:09:42.413 --> 01:09:43.971
He hasn't done anything wrong!

01:09:44.049 --> 01:09:45.913
He hasn't done anything right either!

01:09:45.984 --> 01:09:47.917
I can't believe I'm even
having this argument!

01:09:47.986 --> 01:09:49.920
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

01:09:49.988 --> 01:09:51.455
I'm marrying another man!

01:09:51.523 --> 01:09:55.635
Yes, that's right, you get a second
chance, so please don't mess it up!

01:09:55.694 --> 01:09:58.321
For who?
For me or for you?

01:09:58.396 --> 01:09:59.624
Don't sass me, okay?

01:09:59.697 --> 01:10:02.427
Don't you dare sass me,
'cause I have put up

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.593
with an awful lot from you
over the years.

01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:07.661
Like what?! Like me quitting
your precious pageants?

01:10:07.738 --> 01:10:10.798
I didn't want you to
end up like me! Damn it!

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:14.504
Now, you need to stay as far
away from here as you can.

01:10:14.579 --> 01:10:16.137
That boy is quicksand.

01:10:16.214 --> 01:10:19.546
What's so wrong
with being you, Mama?

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:24.550
I just think that you
deserve better, that's all.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:27.488
I know you do.

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:33.125
You always have.

01:10:33.196 --> 01:10:36.222
I'll see you in New York,
all right?

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.964
You'll like it.

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:42.094
I promise.

01:10:46.542 --> 01:10:48.908
Now, don't you forget to
say goodbye to your daddy.

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.416
Fire!

01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:09.959
Daddy?

01:11:22.309 --> 01:11:23.901
Daddy!

01:11:23.977 --> 01:11:26.946
Who ya lookin' for, darlin'?

01:11:27.014 --> 01:11:29.209
Earl Smooter.

01:11:29.283 --> 01:11:31.877
5th Regiment?

01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:35.221
Anybody seen Earl Smooter?

01:11:35.289 --> 01:11:37.519
He's about to surrender!

01:11:38.492 --> 01:11:39.584
Thank you!

01:11:47.733 --> 01:11:49.166
After you.

01:11:58.311 --> 01:11:59.471
Afternoon.

01:11:59.545 --> 01:12:02.707
How are ya?
- Good, thanks. Yourself?

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:05.614
No complaints.

01:12:05.684 --> 01:12:07.584
That's a beautiful house.

01:12:07.652 --> 01:12:10.120
Sure. Yeah.

01:12:10.188 --> 01:12:13.282
You, uh, you here
to see Bobby Ray?

01:12:13.358 --> 01:12:16.759
Actually, I'm, uh,
hoping to surprise Melanie.

01:12:16.828 --> 01:12:20.594
Melanie?
- My fiancee.

01:12:20.665 --> 01:12:23.258
You got the wrong house,
don't ya?

01:12:23.334 --> 01:12:27.168
This is, uh,
the Carmichael place, isn't it?

01:12:28.238 --> 01:12:30.069
Are we talkin' about the same girl?

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.732
Melanie Smooter?
- Melanie Carmichael.

01:12:31.809 --> 01:12:35.609
Oh, well, that explains it.

01:12:35.679 --> 01:12:38.079
That sure does.

01:12:38.148 --> 01:12:40.343
Andrew Hennings.

01:12:43.052 --> 01:12:44.815
Nice meeting you, Jake.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:59.930
Hey, Jake.

01:13:00.003 --> 01:13:01.664
What's goin' on?

01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:06.536
Oh, you know, I'm just, uh,
talkin' to Mel's fiance here.

01:13:07.075 --> 01:13:09.509
Wonder if you might know
where she is.

01:13:09.578 --> 01:13:11.375
Andrew Hennings.
You must be...

01:13:11.446 --> 01:13:16.406
I'm Bobby Ray...
her, uh, cousin?

01:13:16.485 --> 01:13:20.216
I see you've already met
Jake... her, uh...

01:13:20.288 --> 01:13:22.279
Other cousin.

01:13:22.357 --> 01:13:25.018
Family! God, it's great
to meet you both.

01:13:25.092 --> 01:13:27.026
I think Melanie said
somethin' last night...

01:13:27.094 --> 01:13:30.287
about, uh, visitin' her daddy
up at the... up at the battlefield.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.662
The battlefield?
- You know us Southerners.

01:13:32.733 --> 01:13:35.625
I mean, the minute the Confederacy
died, it became a moral issue.

01:13:35.770 --> 01:13:40.002
Come on, I'll, uh, I'll
give you a ride up there.

01:13:40.074 --> 01:13:43.009
That's great. Thank you.
All right. Nice meeting you.

01:13:52.485 --> 01:13:56.512
So, who's...
Melanie... Smooter?

01:13:56.589 --> 01:13:58.784
Local hero around here.

01:13:58.858 --> 01:14:00.655
Why is that?

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:02.024
She blew up the bank.

01:14:02.095 --> 01:14:04.358
And that made her a hero?

01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:08.560
Well, notorious, anyway.
She was 10.

01:14:09.968 --> 01:14:14.166
Fortunately, nobody was hurt...
except, maybe, the cat.

01:14:14.239 --> 01:14:16.400
What cat?

01:14:16.475 --> 01:14:19.000
The one with the dynamite
on its back.

01:14:19.078 --> 01:14:21.876
She blew up a cat?

01:14:21.947 --> 01:14:24.279
He was scheduled to die.
- From dynamite?

01:14:24.349 --> 01:14:26.873
The vet said it had cancer,...

01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.920
so Eldon thought it'd be put
in one of those chambers,...

01:14:29.987 --> 01:14:32.649
you know, the ones
that suck their lungs out.

01:14:32.724 --> 01:14:35.557
Little Mel, she couldn't bear
the thought of that.

01:14:35.626 --> 01:14:38.060
She, uh, she wanted
somethin' more humane.

01:14:38.129 --> 01:14:40.029
Yeah, sure.

01:14:40.098 --> 01:14:43.261
So, they were doing some
blastin' out by the new highway.

01:14:43.334 --> 01:14:47.827
So, we, uh, we took old Fuzz
up there, taped him up.

01:14:47.938 --> 01:14:51.430
Used about 30 feet of fuse
just to be on the safe side,...

01:14:51.508 --> 01:14:53.271
said our prayers,
and ran like hell.

01:14:53.343 --> 01:14:55.243
Of course.

01:14:55.312 --> 01:14:59.512
So, there we were, sittin' in
Virgie's Diner, feelin' pretty blue.

01:14:59.883 --> 01:15:01.908
When Mel looks up and sees
that damn cat,...

01:15:01.985 --> 01:15:05.113
trottin' down the road,
searchin' for Eldon.

01:15:05.188 --> 01:15:07.553
No shit.

01:15:07.623 --> 01:15:09.386
Yeah, and we
would have caught him, too,...

01:15:09.458 --> 01:15:12.655
but once that fuse hit his tail,
boom, he took off like a shot.

01:15:12.728 --> 01:15:14.127
And into the bank.

01:15:14.196 --> 01:15:16.756
Well... the theory is,...

01:15:16.832 --> 01:15:18.823
he probably wriggled loose
from the explosive.

01:15:18.901 --> 01:15:24.022
'Cause, uh, people still see him from
time to time, scorched tail and all.

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:27.404
He's a little skittish
around humans.

01:15:27.475 --> 01:15:29.909
That's quite a story.

01:15:29.978 --> 01:15:32.071
She was quite a girl.

01:15:35.083 --> 01:15:37.017
Whatever happened to her?

01:15:38.486 --> 01:15:41.717
Oh, you know...
wound up pregnant,...

01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:45.817
married some loser
right out of high school.

01:16:19.258 --> 01:16:21.726
Are you surprised?

01:16:25.198 --> 01:16:27.029
What are you doing here?

01:16:27.099 --> 01:16:29.225
Well, I came to deliver
your fiance.

01:16:29.301 --> 01:16:30.563
I think she was talking to me.

01:16:30.635 --> 01:16:31.693
Jake...

01:16:31.770 --> 01:16:33.397
Must be exhaustin'.

01:16:33.471 --> 01:16:34.403
What?
- What?

01:16:34.472 --> 01:16:35.962
Livin' a lie.

01:16:36.041 --> 01:16:37.235
What's he talking about?

01:16:38.743 --> 01:16:41.712
You and I are in love
with two different people.

01:16:47.619 --> 01:16:50.086
Is he a second cousin?

01:16:51.222 --> 01:16:52.985
He's my husband.

01:16:53.057 --> 01:16:54.217
Your what?

01:16:54.291 --> 01:16:55.315
I mean my ex-husband.

01:16:55.392 --> 01:16:56.859
You married your cousin?!

01:16:56.927 --> 01:16:59.657
No, I came down here
to finalize my divorce.

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:02.221
Hey, darlin',
thought that was you.

01:17:04.802 --> 01:17:06.497
Must be your new someone.

01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:10.039
Earl Smooter...
glad to meet ya.

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:15.571
Melanie Smooter.

01:17:18.414 --> 01:17:19.381
Andrew, wait.

01:17:19.449 --> 01:17:21.041
Wait!

01:17:21.117 --> 01:17:24.052
Andrew! Wait!

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.052
I just...

01:17:25.121 --> 01:17:26.247
Please.

01:17:26.322 --> 01:17:28.187
Let me try and explain myself!

01:17:28.258 --> 01:17:30.226
You don't understand!

01:17:30.293 --> 01:17:32.692
This is not who I am anymore!

01:17:32.761 --> 01:17:34.752
Look, I don't know who you are
or what else you lied about,...

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:36.263
but I know one thing...

01:17:36.331 --> 01:17:39.960
there is a Lear Jet
in Mobile, and I am on it.

01:18:00.521 --> 01:18:01.920
I know you're thinkin'

01:18:01.989 --> 01:18:04.719
I spoiled things good
this time.

01:18:04.792 --> 01:18:08.489
Oh, hon, don't go accusin' me
of thinkin'.

01:18:08.562 --> 01:18:11.690
I ain't done
anything of the sort.

01:18:11.766 --> 01:18:14.757
Anyway, spoiled's in the eye
of the beholder...

01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:17.893
like these plums here.

01:18:17.971 --> 01:18:21.737
Some people might
call them "spoiled"...

01:18:21.808 --> 01:18:26.074
but I think that, um,
these almost-ruined ones...

01:18:26.146 --> 01:18:29.081
sometimes make the sweetest jam.

01:18:31.084 --> 01:18:32.983
Do you need any help?

01:18:35.086 --> 01:18:38.978
It was kind of fun, seeing
Daddy up there, surrendering.

01:18:41.159 --> 01:18:43.923
He sure does have
a flair for the dramatic.

01:18:43.995 --> 01:18:47.123
You certainly don't get it
from my side of the family.

01:18:49.234 --> 01:18:51.065
Hey, y'all.

01:18:51.136 --> 01:18:53.468
Look who I found
walkin' down I-58.

01:19:00.144 --> 01:19:03.545
I thought you'd be
halfway to New York by now.

01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:06.640
So did I.

01:19:06.717 --> 01:19:12.300
If I'd known company was comin',
I'd have put on the dog.

01:19:13.757 --> 01:19:15.621
This is my mama.

01:19:18.094 --> 01:19:19.994
She makes the best jam
in three counties.

01:19:22.231 --> 01:19:24.825
And my dad...
you... you already met him.

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:30.834
And this is our home.

01:19:30.907 --> 01:19:33.375
This is where I grew up.

01:19:34.744 --> 01:19:37.007
Well, it's a pleasure
meeting you both.

01:19:37.079 --> 01:19:39.377
I'm... Andrew Hennings...

01:19:39.448 --> 01:19:41.678
Melanie's fiance...

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:46.380
well... that is... if...
if she'll still have me.

01:19:54.529 --> 01:19:57.964
I really don't care
what happened down here.

01:19:58.032 --> 01:19:59.966
So... you have a past.

01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:02.002
I mean, who doesn't?

01:20:07.608 --> 01:20:13.232
What I need to know is if there is
a place for me in your future.

01:20:13.314 --> 01:20:18.250
Oh, good Lord.
That is the sweetest thing.

01:20:19.853 --> 01:20:21.252
Well, go on.

01:20:27.827 --> 01:20:30.421
Oh! Hello, New York City!

01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:32.897
Woman, what the hell
you gassin' about?

01:20:32.966 --> 01:20:35.332
Well, sir...

01:20:35.402 --> 01:20:37.494
my mother happens to be
the mayor up there, and, uh,...

01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:42.037
she'd like nothing better than
a big, snazzy New York wedding.

01:20:46.678 --> 01:20:49.146
Yeah, I suppose
I can take off work.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:54.548
Andrew, I, um... actually,
I was thinking,...

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.645
maybe we could have the wedding here.

01:20:59.490 --> 01:21:00.582
Here.

01:21:00.658 --> 01:21:02.922
In my hometown.

01:21:03.961 --> 01:21:06.156
Look, Mel, if you're worried
about the money, don't.

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:08.664
It's not about
the money, Andrew...

01:21:08.733 --> 01:21:09.961
not down here.

01:21:13.271 --> 01:21:15.637
You know...
a lot of people

01:21:15.706 --> 01:21:19.232
are expecting us
to get married in the city,...

01:21:19.309 --> 01:21:22.797
but I think a nice, quiet, country
wedding is just the ticket.

01:21:26.883 --> 01:21:30.881
Pearl, if you... if you folks could
take care of the rehearsal dinner,...

01:21:30.954 --> 01:21:33.821
I'd really like
to take care of the rest.

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:36.450
Well, I think
we could cover that.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:43.027
How many times does
your only daughter get married?

01:21:47.703 --> 01:21:50.797
Other than before.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:52.534
Felony Melanie?

01:21:52.608 --> 01:21:53.768
She was never convicted.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:56.977
I don't know which is worse...

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:59.673
child cat killer
or sons of the Confederacy.

01:21:59.747 --> 01:22:02.773
What would you suggest I do...
dump her for being poor?

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.716
You're supposed to be
a Democrat, remember?

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:06.754
There is nothing wrong
with being poor.

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.379
I get elected by poor people and...

01:22:08.456 --> 01:22:12.456
I'm a big enough person to commend her
for making something of herself.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.551
What upsets me
is that she lied to you.

01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:17.120
So what? She was ashamed
of her background.

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:20.031
Who hasn't been embarrassed by
their parents at one point?

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:22.830
I'm going to assume that
was a rhetorical question.

01:22:22.903 --> 01:22:24.666
Assume away.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.807
No one is going to
change my mind about this...

01:22:29.877 --> 01:22:32.072
not you, not the media,
not anyone.

01:22:32.146 --> 01:22:35.172
Fine...

01:22:35.249 --> 01:22:38.343
but admit it...
I was right.

01:22:38.418 --> 01:22:40.978
Yes... you were right.

01:22:43.022 --> 01:22:46.549
There is a wedding in your future,
whether you like it or not.

01:22:48.361 --> 01:22:53.291
And how, exactly, does Little Miss Alabama
plan to accommodate 500 people?

01:22:53.366 --> 01:22:55.357
I suppose she has connections
at the jail.

01:22:55.434 --> 01:22:57.095
Well, there are
several excellent choices...

01:22:57.170 --> 01:23:00.606
the Travelodge,
Days Inn, a Motel 6,...

01:23:00.673 --> 01:23:03.772
oh, and the Golden Cherry Motel,
where we will be.

01:23:03.909 --> 01:23:06.104
Laugh now,
but if this gets out...

01:23:06.178 --> 01:23:07.145
It won't.

01:23:07.212 --> 01:23:10.079
The press expects
the Plaza in June.

01:23:31.869 --> 01:23:33.461
Now, let's talk
about your wedding.

01:23:33.537 --> 01:23:37.495
This place is gorgeous and
we can control the security.

01:23:37.608 --> 01:23:39.098
The Carmichael plantation?

01:23:39.176 --> 01:23:42.043
It did inspire your identity,
did it not?

01:23:42.112 --> 01:23:44.272
You thought of everything.
- Yeah, well, I always do.

01:23:44.347 --> 01:23:46.110
Been great.
Keep in touch.

01:24:24.852 --> 01:24:26.717
You guys remember the sheik.
- Yeah.

01:24:26.787 --> 01:24:28.015
Well, he proposed to me,...

01:24:28.089 --> 01:24:30.455
and I think I loved him,
despite his billions.

01:24:30.524 --> 01:24:32.151
Then why didn't you say "yes"?

01:24:32.226 --> 01:24:34.319
Because I hesitated
long enough to realize...

01:24:34.395 --> 01:24:36.989
my head and my heart were saying
two different things.

01:24:37.064 --> 01:24:38.929
It's this way.
- Yeah.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.467
Well, it's a big decision.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:42.525
Well, it's supposed to be
the easiest one you ever make.

01:24:42.603 --> 01:24:43.797
Wasn't it?

01:24:46.906 --> 01:24:48.373
Hey, Tabby, this is it...

01:24:48.441 --> 01:24:50.932
this is the stuff
I was telling you about.

01:24:51.011 --> 01:24:53.309
"Deep South Glass."

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.144
Oh, yes. Let's.

01:25:22.207 --> 01:25:24.004
What's the matter?

01:25:24.076 --> 01:25:25.236
Oh, my God.

01:25:27.612 --> 01:25:30.843
Do we know...

01:25:30.915 --> 01:25:32.542
Mo'?

01:25:41.759 --> 01:25:43.283
Mel?

01:26:10.052 --> 01:26:12.316
Look at these.

01:26:12.388 --> 01:26:15.255
It's what happens to sand
when it's struck by lightning.

01:26:15.324 --> 01:26:16.916
She's pulling your dick.

01:26:16.992 --> 01:26:19.893
No, really.
I've seen it.

01:26:19.962 --> 01:26:22.055
You just have to dig it up.

01:26:34.175 --> 01:26:35.733
Oh, hey, Bryant.

01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:36.902
Friend of yours?

01:26:51.658 --> 01:26:54.286
I saw him first.

01:26:54.361 --> 01:26:58.320
I, uh...
think he's already taken.

01:27:03.203 --> 01:27:05.296
I tried to call you
a couple of times.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.340
Listen, since you're here,...

01:27:08.409 --> 01:27:12.095
you and your friends should look
around and have some lunch.

01:27:12.178 --> 01:27:14.305
Y'all should sit
on the deck. It's nice.

01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:26.985
Come on, Bryant, let's, uh...
let's leave this lady alone.

01:27:28.895 --> 01:27:30.361
Come on.

01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:36.093
Come on, boy.

01:27:40.238 --> 01:27:41.830
Yes, sir.
Can we help you?

01:27:42.908 --> 01:27:46.173
I'm... I'm looking
for a Melanie Carmichael.

01:27:47.379 --> 01:27:48.778
Anybody here recognize that name?

01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:50.109
No.

01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:52.615
What business you got with her?

01:27:52.683 --> 01:27:55.015
I'm afraid that's a private matter.

01:27:56.253 --> 01:27:58.517
Well, then, I'm afraid
we can't help you.

01:28:09.733 --> 01:28:11.633
Damn reporters.

01:28:11.701 --> 01:28:14.397
Like the first ant at a picnic.

01:28:16.072 --> 01:28:20.372
Now... this one here's
from Louisiana.

01:28:20.443 --> 01:28:23.105
See? It's got
a little alligator on top.

01:28:23.179 --> 01:28:25.875
How sweet. I can see where
your daughter gets her taste.

01:28:32.921 --> 01:28:35.446
This is one of those disasters
waiting to happen.

01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:38.186
You know, one of the big ones
that only cockroaches survive.

01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.693
It's going to be fine.

01:28:51.374 --> 01:28:53.568
One down...
7 million to go.

01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:54.870
Careful.

01:28:54.943 --> 01:28:56.604
You just smashed
the state bird of Alabama.

01:29:01.249 --> 01:29:03.012
Well, finally.
- Hi! How are you?!

01:29:03.084 --> 01:29:04.779
Hey, buddy.
- Hello, sir.

01:29:04.853 --> 01:29:07.253
Well, I can see
why Melanie is so adorable.

01:29:07.322 --> 01:29:08.689
I'm so happy to be here.

01:29:11.193 --> 01:29:13.252
We're so happy
to have you here.

01:29:13.328 --> 01:29:15.192
I'm sorry the place is
such a mess, Mrs. Hennings...

01:29:15.262 --> 01:29:16.229
Mayor... ma'am!

01:29:16.297 --> 01:29:18.356
No, no, no, no, no...
don't you dare. It's "Kate."

01:29:18.432 --> 01:29:20.195
You know, I've been
tryin' to get Earl...

01:29:20.267 --> 01:29:23.134
to weed these shrubberies
and repaint the trim.

01:29:23.204 --> 01:29:27.436
And... oh, my God,
look how pretty she is, Earl.

01:29:27.508 --> 01:29:29.874
Yeah, I'll bet Kate
could use a drink.

01:29:29.977 --> 01:29:31.638
Kate could, indeed.

01:29:31.812 --> 01:29:33.475
Well, just come right on in.

01:29:33.547 --> 01:29:37.704
I've got some fried pickles,
hot right out of the grease.

01:29:37.984 --> 01:29:41.010
Had a lot of trouble
getting my house painted, too.

01:29:42.589 --> 01:29:44.648
It's a lovely chair, Earl.

01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:47.916
Yeah, but to get the full effect,
you got to pull this here handle.

01:29:48.027 --> 01:29:49.551
Daddy, no!

01:29:49.629 --> 01:29:51.790
Now, you hold onto
your drink, Kate, and watch.

01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:58.433
We're so sorry, Kate!
- We'll get you up.

01:30:17.488 --> 01:30:19.183
Name?

01:30:19.257 --> 01:30:21.020
Uh, Buford...
Wallace Buford.

01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:22.582
I'm not on that list,

01:30:22.660 --> 01:30:25.026
but I've got some urgent
business with the bride.

01:30:25.096 --> 01:30:27.792
Not today, you don't.
Trooper?

01:30:27.865 --> 01:30:29.799
All right, sir, let's get it
turned around here.

01:30:56.993 --> 01:30:59.754
Hey, there's a weddin' goin' on.

01:30:59.828 --> 01:31:02.126
Yeah, I heard mention of it
a time or two.

01:31:02.197 --> 01:31:05.792
I sure hope this weather cooperates.

01:31:05.868 --> 01:31:08.769
It's supposed to be a big one.

01:31:08.837 --> 01:31:10.304
You know, Jake...

01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:18.008
You're my only son...
and I love you, but sometimes...

01:31:18.346 --> 01:31:23.249
you are too much
like your daddy.

01:31:23.318 --> 01:31:25.843
She made her decision, Mama.

01:31:28.089 --> 01:31:31.718
For somebody who's been holdin'
onto somethin' so hard,...

01:31:31.793 --> 01:31:33.658
you're pretty quick
to let it go.

01:31:36.964 --> 01:31:41.160
You know, I can't control her any
more than I can control the weather.

01:31:54.348 --> 01:31:56.043
It's just nerves.

01:31:56.116 --> 01:31:58.516
You're doin' the right thing.

01:31:59.618 --> 01:32:01.142
Am I?

01:32:03.122 --> 01:32:05.750
When I married your daddy...

01:32:05.825 --> 01:32:08.919
oh, Lord, but I was
a fool for that man.

01:32:08.994 --> 01:32:11.519
I couldn't put one foot
in front of the other.

01:32:11.597 --> 01:32:13.622
I remember standin' there,
thinkin',...

01:32:13.699 --> 01:32:17.897
"Oh, preacher, hurry up
before he changes his mind."

01:32:18.370 --> 01:32:20.233
Look where it got me.

01:32:21.506 --> 01:32:25.931
Sometimes that man makes me so mad,
I could just wring his neck.

01:32:26.044 --> 01:32:27.534
But you still love him.

01:32:27.612 --> 01:32:29.102
God knows I do.

01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:32.547
And only he knows why.

01:32:32.617 --> 01:32:34.482
Mama... I think I...

01:32:34.552 --> 01:32:39.353
He can give you a life
that we never dreamed of.

01:32:39.424 --> 01:32:41.254
And he adores you.

01:32:45.462 --> 01:32:46.952
He does, doesn't he?

01:33:20.997 --> 01:33:24.693
Well, even if he is a Yankee,
at least he's sober.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:25.926
Ms. Carmichael!

01:33:26.001 --> 01:33:27.696
Hey!
- Ms. Carmichael!

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:29.669
Get him!
- Ms. Carmichael!

01:33:29.738 --> 01:33:30.727
Get back here!

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.269
Mr. Buford?

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.712
Get your hands off me!

01:33:40.782 --> 01:33:42.476
Wait! Let him go.

01:33:46.353 --> 01:33:47.718
Melanie?

01:33:47.888 --> 01:33:51.083
You are one hard woman
to get in touch with.

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.761
Mr. Buford, he signed the papers.

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:57.320
What are you doing here?

01:34:02.736 --> 01:34:06.330
He did... you didn't.

01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.565
What?

01:34:14.547 --> 01:34:16.208
You mean I'm still married?

01:34:18.117 --> 01:34:20.881
Well, not unless you want to be.

01:34:20.954 --> 01:34:22.649
Oh, for God's sakes, Melanie.

01:34:22.722 --> 01:34:24.586
I thought you took care of this.

01:34:24.656 --> 01:34:26.317
It's an honest mistake, Andrew.

01:34:26.391 --> 01:34:28.985
Well, then, can we fix it
before we all get soaked?

01:34:29.061 --> 01:34:31.154
Does anybody have a pen?

01:34:34.299 --> 01:34:36.392
Mom?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:34:36.468 --> 01:34:38.402
Go on, check your purse.

01:34:42.407 --> 01:34:44.738
These things don't
just happen, you know.

01:34:47.078 --> 01:34:50.047
Can't ride two horses
with one ass, sugar bean.

01:35:25.348 --> 01:35:26.439
Andrew...

01:35:28.150 --> 01:35:29.811
You don't want to marry me.

01:35:29.885 --> 01:35:32.914
I don't?
- No.

01:35:34.056 --> 01:35:39.187
No, you don't...
not really.

01:35:41.930 --> 01:35:45.264
You see, the truth is...

01:35:45.334 --> 01:35:47.460
I gave my heart away
a long time ago...

01:35:48.636 --> 01:35:51.070
My whole heart...

01:35:51.139 --> 01:35:53.607
and I never really
got it back.

01:35:53.675 --> 01:35:58.637
And I don't even know what
else to say, but I'm sorry.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.441
I can't marry you.

01:36:07.487 --> 01:36:09.978
And you shouldn't want
to marry me.

01:36:18.832 --> 01:36:21.801
So this
is what this feels like.

01:36:23.737 --> 01:36:26.228
That's it?!

01:36:26.306 --> 01:36:28.330
You're just gonna
let her humiliate you...

01:36:28.407 --> 01:36:31.035
with some bullshit
about an old husband?!

01:36:52.397 --> 01:36:54.863
Yeah, I think I am.

01:37:01.272 --> 01:37:03.297
Excuse me.

01:37:13.150 --> 01:37:16.017
In my entire life...

01:37:16.086 --> 01:37:20.887
I have never met anyone
so manipulative, so deceitful!

01:37:22.092 --> 01:37:23.389
And I'm in politics!

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.428
I'm just trying to be honest.

01:37:25.496 --> 01:37:29.687
I will not allow the future
President of the United States...

01:37:29.799 --> 01:37:33.166
to be dumped at the altar
by some psycho Daisy Mae!

01:37:33.236 --> 01:37:35.500
You go after him,
you little bitch!

01:37:36.171 --> 01:37:38.267
Wait just a minute, missy.

01:37:38.341 --> 01:37:40.775
Uh, there... there's no need
for name-callin', now.

01:37:40.843 --> 01:37:44.074
Now, she spoke her piece,
and that's all there is to it.

01:37:44.147 --> 01:37:48.873
Oh, go back to your double-wide
and fry something.

01:37:58.827 --> 01:38:01.227
Nobody talks
to my mama like that!

01:38:01.296 --> 01:38:04.356
Praise the Lord!
The South has risen again!

01:38:16.911 --> 01:38:18.845
If you're friends of the bride,
stick around!

01:38:18.913 --> 01:38:20.847
I'm gonna go find me
a groom!

01:39:15.733 --> 01:39:16.927
Hey, cowboy...

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:24.308
You owe me a dance.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:27.435
Nice dress.
Where's your husband?

01:39:27.512 --> 01:39:29.503
I'm lookin' at him.

01:39:31.850 --> 01:39:34.147
Apparently,
you and I are still hitched.

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.118
Is that right?

01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:41.217
Why didn't you tell me
you came to New York?

01:39:41.291 --> 01:39:44.021
I needed to make
somethin' of myself.

01:39:44.094 --> 01:39:45.493
About done?

01:39:47.164 --> 01:39:49.564
What is it
about you Southern girls?

01:39:49.633 --> 01:39:52.458
You can't make the right decisions
'til you tried all the wrong ones?

01:39:52.536 --> 01:39:53.730
At least I fight
for what I want.

01:39:53.804 --> 01:39:55.532
Oh, what do you want, Melanie?

01:39:55.605 --> 01:39:57.971
I don't even think you know.

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.804
You're the first boy
I ever kissed, Jake,...

01:40:00.877 --> 01:40:02.777
and I want you
to be the last.

01:40:02.879 --> 01:40:05.473
Maybe you and I had our chance.

01:40:07.183 --> 01:40:08.309
Fine!

01:40:08.384 --> 01:40:10.477
Have it your way,
you stubborn ass!

01:40:14.257 --> 01:40:17.157
Whatcha want to be
married to me for, anyhow?

01:40:24.332 --> 01:40:26.857
So I can kiss you
any time I want.

01:40:46.053 --> 01:40:48.749
What the hell are you two
tryin' to do...

01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:50.687
get yourselves killed?!

01:40:52.059 --> 01:40:54.391
What seems to be
the trouble, officer?

01:40:54.461 --> 01:40:56.724
I'm here to bring you in,
young lady!

01:40:56.796 --> 01:40:59.287
What did she do this time?

01:40:59.365 --> 01:41:00.764
Well, the way I hear it,...

01:41:00.833 --> 01:41:03.393
seems she run out
on a perfectly good cake.

01:41:24.656 --> 01:41:26.647
You're gettin' a
little light-headed.

01:41:38.903 --> 01:41:41.872
Well, folks, look who finally
made it to their reception...

01:41:41.939 --> 01:41:45.466
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. And Mr. Jake Perry!

01:42:01.558 --> 01:42:05.289
You might want to keep those
for the honeymoon.

01:42:11.434 --> 01:42:15.803
Well... I do believe I owe
this lady a dance.

01:42:15.872 --> 01:42:17.100
You sure do!

01:42:23.912 --> 01:42:25.436
Shut up, Bryant.
- Shut up, Bryant.

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:29.842
Look at this.

01:42:35.457 --> 01:42:37.288
Hey, Stella...

01:42:39.128 --> 01:42:41.357
Make it a slow one.

01:43:22.234 --> 01:43:23.763
All right, wait.

01:43:41.087 --> 01:43:43.486
How are you?

01:44:15.786 --> 01:44:17.617
All right,
just stand right here.
