19:54.583 --> 19:56.333
You're right.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.625
I do work hard.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.834
It's really, really hard being this good.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.166
No kidding.
It's exhausting just watching you.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.166
Come on.

20:07.166 --> 20:11.208
SAM: <i>Another great thing about my friends</i>
<i>are that they are patient.</i>

20:12.041 --> 20:14.083
<i>They understand</i>
<i>that I'm just learning things now</i>

20:14.083 --> 20:16.333
<i>that I should have known</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

20:16.333 --> 20:19.917
<i>Like how the only person</i>
<i>you can really change is yourself.</i>

20:22.458 --> 20:25.625
<i>See, the thing is, if you're so busy</i>
<i>worrying about other people</i>

20:25.625 --> 20:28.125
<i>that you're not paying attention</i>
<i>to your own life,</i>

20:28.125 --> 20:31.500
<i>you might miss out on something</i>
<i>really, really important.</i>

20:31.500 --> 20:32.959
[SIGHS]

20:50.750 --> 20:52.041
<i>That's why, from now on,</i>

20:52.041 --> 20:54.834
<i>I've gotta keep my eyes</i>
<i>on the road ahead of me.</i>

20:54.834 --> 20:56.875
<i>Stay focused on my own path.</i>

20:56.875 --> 21:00.208
<i>It's not always easy, but it's worth it.</i>

21:01.208 --> 21:03.625
Listen up, people.
If you happen to come across a body part,

21:03.625 --> 21:06.542
don't forget to use
your emergency whistle.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.291
<i>And I don't have to worry</i>
<i>about anything,</i>

21:08.291 --> 21:10.750
<i>because no matter where</i>
<i>that road takes me,</i>

21:10.750 --> 21:13.041
<i>I know I'm gonna have my best friends</i>
<i>right beside me.</i>

21:13.375 --> 21:18.083
Keep moving. I'm not here
to make friends. Just doing my time.

21:18.417 --> 21:21.667
<i>Even if they have to be, by law.</i>
