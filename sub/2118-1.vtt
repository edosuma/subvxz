<i>Did you know that when someone attractive
enters your sightline</i>

00:42.899 --> 00:45.669
<i>your pupils dilate 20 percent?</i>

00:45.769 --> 00:49.206
<i>Or when someone falls in love
their brain floods with dopamine?</i>

00:49.306 --> 00:53.676
<i>You know what else causes
that chemical reaction? Narcotics.</i>

00:54.476 --> 00:56.411
<i>It's crazy, right?</i>

00:56.511 --> 00:59.515
<i>But that's the fun shit
I'm learning right now.</i>

01:00.215 --> 01:03.485
<i>See, I've been hired to write
this romantic comedy screenplay...</i>

01:04.208 --> 01:09.091
<i>and the problem is I've never actually,
you know... been in love, so...</i>

01:13.327 --> 01:15.930
<i>it's slow-going.</i>

01:16.865 --> 01:19.033
<i>Yeah... intelligent.</i>

01:19.433 --> 01:21.569
<i>To help, I rely on this writer's trick.</i>

01:21.969 --> 01:23.938
<i>When other people tell me
their tales of romance</i>

01:24.038 --> 01:27.141
<i>I try to imagine myself
as the characters in the story.</i>

01:27.241 --> 01:31.045
<i>You know, the ones... in love.</i>

01:31.145 --> 01:35.765
<i>It's kind of a desperate attempt to feel
something, I suppose. Anything, really.</i>

01:35.865 --> 01:39.753
<i>It's a little narcissistic,
but it works.</i>

01:41.154 --> 01:45.891
<i>I think the closest I ever came
would be the summer of '89.</i>

01:47.527 --> 01:50.063
<i>Kristin... my babysitter.</i>

01:50.163 --> 01:54.533
<i>We were deeply, passionately,
madly in love for one glorious night.</i>

01:54.633 --> 01:57.670
<i>Until my granddad came home
early from poker.</i>

01:57.770 --> 02:01.052
<i>God, could she dance.
I think since then,</i>

02:01.152 --> 02:05.178
<i>all of my experiences involving love
usually start out something like this.</i>

02:07.513 --> 02:09.481
You know, I always did think
you were pretty cute.

02:09.580 --> 02:12.083
You still got that boyfriend?

02:12.183 --> 02:15.466
- Yeah.
- You guys in love?

02:17.856 --> 02:20.825
<i>Then they lead somewhere like this.</i>

02:22.493 --> 02:26.730
<i>And then usually end up
something like this.</i>

02:27.331 --> 02:29.833
<i>How about some back story?</i>

02:29.933 --> 02:33.476
- No, it's a RomCom.
- No... romance.

02:33.576 --> 02:36.907
It's a favor for the producer,
because the studio hates the third act.

02:37.007 --> 02:39.076
This is gonna be huge. Okay?

02:39.176 --> 02:43.180
They have... Ashley Tisdale
from High School Musical

02:43.280 --> 02:47.784
and Matthew Morrison from Glee!
It's gonna be huge!

02:48.184 --> 02:50.731
I can see the poster now, man.

02:50.831 --> 02:53.503
- Morr-Ash.
- That's not a thing.

02:53.603 --> 02:57.054
I just made it a thing.
Come on, play along!

02:58.394 --> 03:00.920
Work your magic on this one
because the same producer

03:01.020 --> 03:03.179
has a huge action job coming up.

03:03.279 --> 03:06.134
- All right? Set in Malaysia!
- You know I'm dying to write action.

03:06.234 --> 03:10.472
So, do the RomCom
and I will get you the action job.

03:10.572 --> 03:14.810
It's six weeks in Malaysia!
Malaysian women.

03:16.444 --> 03:19.681
- You ever bang a Malaysian chick before?
- No.

03:19.781 --> 03:23.753
Man... this cigarette is like
an elephant's dick to them.

03:24.053 --> 03:28.190
They're sweet and warm and genuine.
They're caring, beautiful women...

03:29.873 --> 03:32.393
that you can rip apart!

03:32.993 --> 03:34.577
Yeah!

03:34.677 --> 03:37.410
And Swayze says to her,
for the first time,

03:37.510 --> 03:39.199
because he's never
been able to say this before...

03:39.299 --> 03:43.337
"I love you, Molly. I...

03:45.839 --> 03:47.707
"I've always loved you."

03:47.807 --> 03:52.411
And then Demi Moore
says to him, "Ditto."

03:52.511 --> 03:55.948
Remember that's what he said to her...
at the beginning of the movie?

03:56.048 --> 03:58.718
Okay. It's no Terminator, but...

03:58.818 --> 04:01.254
What? I'm s... wait, what?

04:01.354 --> 04:04.856
I'm sorry, you think Terminator
is more romantic than Ghost?

04:04.956 --> 04:05.825
Yeah.

04:05.925 --> 04:09.728
Okay, you're messing with me.
Oh, my God, you're not messing with me.

04:09.828 --> 04:13.004
- Okay, Terminator? Okay...
- It's the same guy who did Titanic.

04:13.104 --> 04:16.534
Okay... this is...
my head's gonna explode.

04:16.634 --> 04:18.904
I'll be back.

04:19.704 --> 04:21.784
And that's not a reference to...

04:21.884 --> 04:24.731
many people have said that...
in the history of time.

04:24.831 --> 04:28.846
<i>This is my buddy, Scott.
We'd been friends since the day we met.</i>

04:31.400 --> 04:33.217
Excuse me!

04:34.152 --> 04:36.143
You left your...

04:38.089 --> 04:40.791
Hey! You left your package!

04:43.392 --> 04:44.901
Hey!

04:45.001 --> 04:47.063
Hey, wait up!

04:47.163 --> 04:48.252
Shit!

04:51.367 --> 04:53.536
Shit. Don't hurt me, I'm a writer.

04:53.636 --> 04:55.805
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Why are you running?

04:56.005 --> 04:58.848
- Because you were chasing me!
- Because you left your package.

04:58.948 --> 05:01.243
On purpose... Oh, my God.

05:01.343 --> 05:04.680
Who leaves packages on purpose?
You can't do that shit post-911, you know.

05:04.780 --> 05:07.617
It's my favorite novel,
Love in the Time of Cholera.

05:07.717 --> 05:12.917
I leave it random places
for people to find. It's...

05:13.017 --> 05:14.690
It's my art.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.294
- You're insane?
- Yeah.

05:20.394 --> 05:22.557
- What's your name?
- I'm Scott.

05:22.657 --> 05:25.700
- All right. Let's get your bag.
- Holy shit.

05:26.300 --> 05:29.003
All right, what's up, N-word?

05:29.103 --> 05:32.440
So, the guy character
has multiple personalities.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.176
He meets the girl character,
who has multiple personalities.

05:35.276 --> 05:40.317
And one of his personalities falls in love
with one of her personalities.

05:40.681 --> 05:42.149
That sounds really good.

05:43.617 --> 05:46.253
It's terrible. It's full of clichÃ©s.

05:46.353 --> 05:50.253
It has a gay, best friend personality.
It has a bitch, girlfriend personality.

05:50.353 --> 05:52.425
It has a feisty, Hispanic personality.

05:52.525 --> 05:55.361
It has a black, female,
detective personality.

05:55.661 --> 05:58.122
Oh, there's even an act three
running-through-an-airport scene.

05:59.231 --> 06:01.234
God, I love
running-through-the-airport scenes.

06:01.534 --> 06:04.437
Okay, we gotta top that.
Put them on a bridge.

06:04.837 --> 06:06.454
How romantic is that?
You got two people on a bridge,

06:06.554 --> 06:10.029
maybe there's like a whole crowd
following them and cheering... and like,

06:10.129 --> 06:11.912
- you know, maybe one guy's doing...
- Yeah, I'm not doing any of that.

06:12.012 --> 06:16.014
- But like a slow clap, like...
- I'm not doing any of that, Scott.

06:16.314 --> 06:18.983
Well, then you're not really
making a RomCom.

06:19.083 --> 06:22.013
Look, if I'm gonna do this,
I just wanna write something

06:22.113 --> 06:26.724
that shows love how it really is,
you know? Not funny, not romantic.

06:26.824 --> 06:29.928
Okay... but that kind of
sounds like a downer.

06:30.028 --> 06:32.597
Let me explain.
Love starts out like this...

06:33.897 --> 06:36.467
I'm sorry, my palms get kind of sweaty.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.497
I don't care.

06:38.597 --> 06:40.840
I love you.

06:41.305 --> 06:44.675
And then he threw up.
He tried to say it was food poisoning

06:44.775 --> 06:47.745
but I haven't been able to make love
with the lights on since.

06:47.845 --> 06:52.662
You are so beautiful.
I'm just lucky to have you.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.652
<i>But then quickly becomes more like this.</i>

06:55.752 --> 06:58.255
I work with her! What do you
want me to do, baby? Quit my job?

06:58.355 --> 07:00.190
No, I want you to keep
eye-humping her all night!

07:00.290 --> 07:01.092
Baby, stop!

07:01.192 --> 07:04.393
Don't touch me with your sticky
disgusting, reptile hands!

07:04.493 --> 07:06.630
<i>You give away your most
personal information</i>

07:06.730 --> 07:09.333
<i>only to have your secrets
come back to destroy you.</i>

07:09.433 --> 07:11.467
Stop being melodramatic.

07:11.567 --> 07:15.838
Maybe if you'd hit the gym once in a while,
you wouldn't need that sob story.

07:15.938 --> 07:18.508
No wonder he threw up.

07:19.048 --> 07:20.688
<i>How do I know this?</i>

07:20.788 --> 07:24.362
<i>Well, take my story, for example.</i>

07:24.846 --> 07:28.149
<i>There's no stronger force
than a mother's love.</i>

07:28.249 --> 07:29.784
I love you.

07:29.884 --> 07:33.714
<i>She keeps you safe, secure...</i>

07:33.814 --> 07:36.358
<i>It's unconditional, right?</i>

07:39.560 --> 07:43.198
<i>And then without warning,
the bottom falls out.</i>

07:43.298 --> 07:46.834
<i>And you're left to watch helplessly
as your world comes crashing down.</i>

07:46.934 --> 07:50.838
- Mom, where's the prize?
- Mom's not here, son.

07:55.675 --> 07:58.312
<i>That's what love does,
it leaves you with Granddad</i>

07:58.412 --> 08:00.981
<i>to go to Chile with Phillip...</i>

08:01.081 --> 08:02.727
<i>and ruins a perfectly good cereal.</i>

08:03.250 --> 08:06.286
<i>And that's the last time I saw her.</i>

08:06.386 --> 08:08.320
<i>That's why every time
someone has said...</i>

08:08.520 --> 08:11.323
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:11.423 --> 08:14.026
- I love you.
- I love you.

08:14.426 --> 08:16.663
- I love you.
- <i>My response has been...</i>

08:16.763 --> 08:20.199
I just don't see myself ever feeling
the same way about you.

08:33.945 --> 08:36.514
<i>And there you have me.</i>

08:42.320 --> 08:44.022
<i>By the way, that's my heart.</i>

08:44.422 --> 08:46.556
<i>You know how some people
wear their hearts on their sleeve?</i>

08:46.656 --> 08:49.727
<i>Well, I kicked mine out a long time ago,
and now he just follows me around...</i>

08:49.827 --> 08:51.529
<i>chain smoking.</i>

08:52.730 --> 08:57.167
<i>Okay, so, like I said,
it's been my life.</i>

08:58.368 --> 09:00.538
<i>But then I met this girl.</i>

09:01.338 --> 09:04.141
Come on, Scott! Let's go, man!
These people are obnoxious.

09:04.241 --> 09:06.409
Well, sorry there aren't
any perfect tens here,

09:06.509 --> 09:09.512
but we're staying until they auction
off that couple's Champagne bath.

09:09.612 --> 09:11.714
I don't care if they're all fours,

09:11.814 --> 09:14.884
but if I have to hear one more four
talk about her vegan pet,

09:14.984 --> 09:17.187
my sperm are gonna start
eating each other.

09:21.991 --> 09:24.493
- Shit.
- Colorful.

09:25.493 --> 09:27.963
- It's a gift.
- No, please, continue.

09:28.363 --> 09:31.600
- I think I made my point.
- No, I don't think you're drunk enough.

09:31.700 --> 09:36.105
I mean, we're fours now, but a couple
drinks from now... we might be sixes.

09:37.445 --> 09:39.669
Point well taken... cutting myself off.

09:39.769 --> 09:43.035
I think the rest of my night
is going to involve online shopping

09:43.135 --> 09:46.005
and eating my feelings.

09:46.105 --> 09:49.017
Online shopping...
I would have taken you for a porn guy.

09:51.635 --> 09:54.421
No, I'm off porn. It objectifies women.

09:54.521 --> 09:56.850
Oh, so that's a bad thing now?

09:56.950 --> 10:00.027
No, no, I'm not against women
being objectified, per se.

10:00.127 --> 10:02.228
I guess I'm just sick of men
not being objectified.

10:02.328 --> 10:05.297
Oh, I'm sick of women not being judged
by how much money we make.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.500
I mean, if I spend an hour
and change getting ready,

10:07.600 --> 10:10.035
I want to be ogled.
I'm pretty much begging for it.

10:10.135 --> 10:13.940
Exactly, and I'm tired of being wanted
for my body, but not my pocket book.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.910
We're drinking $300 wine here.
My money is no good?

10:18.110 --> 10:20.312
<i>Oh, God, this girl's dangerous.</i>

10:20.412 --> 10:23.248
Do you want to do a social experiment?

10:24.449 --> 10:28.218
Nice ass. You work out?

10:28.686 --> 10:32.323
Is that dress a Valentino?
You know what this suit's made out of?

10:32.423 --> 10:34.358
Boyfriend material.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.095
That suit looks good on you,
but I bet it would look even better

10:37.195 --> 10:39.933
balled up in a corner of a hotel room.

10:40.033 --> 10:44.100
Well, I'd love to travel more,
but I have crushing student debt.

10:46.036 --> 10:49.173
God, sorry... I'm sorry.

11:06.222 --> 11:08.758
Oh, God, look at this guy, so stuffy.

11:08.858 --> 11:12.246
Do the... the blow job,
the tongue-in-the-cheek thing.

11:12.346 --> 11:15.098
No, he's my boyfriend.

11:16.164 --> 11:19.166
- Hi, honey.
- Darling, there you are.

11:20.235 --> 11:24.806
<i>I have no idea what Stuffy said,
because I went temporarily deaf.</i>

11:27.744 --> 11:31.747
Where'd you go, homey?
I was looking for you.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.415
You don't look too good.

11:34.515 --> 11:37.018
Oh, did you have the crab?

11:37.418 --> 11:39.379
Yeah, I had the crab.

11:39.479 --> 11:41.789
It's probably why I was on
the shitter for so long.

11:41.889 --> 11:43.658
<i>Okay, that sucked.</i>

11:43.758 --> 11:47.761
<i>Shake it off.
Time to randomly text some chicks.</i>

12:34.105 --> 12:37.408
Hey. I'm so glad you called.

12:37.608 --> 12:38.695
<i>I didn't.</i>

12:41.867 --> 12:45.518
<i>I found that love is like a leak in a boat.
It starts slow, with a drip,</i>

12:45.618 --> 12:48.586
<i>and if you don't plug it,
it gets worse until you drown.</i>

12:48.986 --> 12:52.022
<i>And to fix it,
you should really find an expert.</i>

12:59.229 --> 13:03.274
<i>I want to tell him, "No, Mr. Policeman,
this is not a thumbs-up moment."</i>

13:03.534 --> 13:04.802
<i>But yeah, it is.</i>

13:09.839 --> 13:12.442
<i>We all have different patches
for the leak, and mine is sex.</i>

13:12.542 --> 13:15.735
<i>Which is about to erase all the traces
of that girl from the charity event</i>

13:15.835 --> 13:17.480
<i>right out of my brain.</i>

13:21.984 --> 13:23.878
Wait.

13:25.087 --> 13:27.956
Stop. Stop. Stop. I'm sorry.

13:28.856 --> 13:30.893
What the hell?

13:31.193 --> 13:32.601
Good question.

13:35.996 --> 13:38.333
Question for you,
there was a girl here...

13:38.433 --> 13:43.304
she had brown hair,
just a great, great, girl height.

13:43.404 --> 13:49.643
Perfect smile, red dress,
kind of a whole happy thing going on.

13:49.743 --> 13:52.647
- Ringing any bells?
- No. Sorry.

13:55.015 --> 13:57.417
Shit.

14:04.091 --> 14:04.958
Hey!

14:06.492 --> 14:07.804
What the hell were you doing?

14:07.904 --> 14:10.831
Listen, Erin, you're amazing,
but is there somewhere I could drop you?

14:12.031 --> 14:14.250
<i>She would go on to say
her name was Regan.</i>

14:14.350 --> 14:16.669
<i>At least I think it was.</i>

14:16.769 --> 14:19.405
<i>Wow, I'm not good with names.</i>

14:19.905 --> 14:22.709
<i>Teresa, she could be a Teresa.</i>

14:22.809 --> 14:25.210
<i>Jenn with two N's, no, never.</i>

14:25.310 --> 14:27.313
<i>Mary, too plain.</i>

14:27.413 --> 14:31.116
<i>Shantiqua, highly unlikely.</i>

14:31.216 --> 14:34.252
<i>Chastity, fuck, I hope not.</i>

14:39.924 --> 14:41.511
<i>If there's one thing
you should know about writers</i>

14:41.611 --> 14:44.128
<i>is that we don't suffer alone very well.</i>

14:44.228 --> 14:47.197
<i>It's why we write.
It's why we form little groups.</i>

14:47.297 --> 14:49.032
<i>This is mine in action.</i>

14:49.132 --> 14:51.368
<i>Lyle, single, harmless deviant.</i>

14:51.468 --> 14:55.506
<i>The proud writer of the first 20 pages
of 16 screenplays and 12 novels.</i>

14:55.606 --> 14:57.875
<i>He needs a shower.</i>

15:01.411 --> 15:05.214
<i>Samson, married, graphic novelist,
poems, short stories...</i>

15:05.314 --> 15:09.819
<i>kind of too old to be hanging out
with us but we don't give a shit.</i>

15:13.022 --> 15:16.938
<i>Mallory, she writes and performs
intensely personal one-woman shows</i>

15:17.038 --> 15:19.195
<i>she drags the rest of us to.</i>

15:19.295 --> 15:22.099
<i>We fuck sometimes... for research.</i>

15:22.999 --> 15:25.601
<i>Scott, you met him.</i>

15:27.069 --> 15:28.971
Why do you need to know her name?

15:29.171 --> 15:31.161
I guess...

15:31.261 --> 15:33.981
I kind of wanted to say
her name out loud.

15:34.081 --> 15:37.146
Oh, stop, it's a passing infatuation,
that's allowed.

15:37.246 --> 15:40.248
Gee, I wish some guy thought about
saying my name out loud.

15:40.348 --> 15:42.149
You mean like while he's playing
with his dangly bits?

15:42.249 --> 15:44.486
- Yes.
- Who says there are no more romantics?

15:44.586 --> 15:48.555
No, I actually think the whole idea of love
is kind of unrealistic and outdated.

15:48.655 --> 15:51.332
- That's touching.
- Well, make sure that goes in your RomCom.

15:51.432 --> 15:54.096
- You know how I kill infatuation?
- With a gun?

15:54.896 --> 15:57.531
When I meet a hot girl,
I'll just look for one flaw

15:57.631 --> 16:02.336
whether she's pigeon-toed
or knock-kneed or just not very polite.

16:02.936 --> 16:07.007
I focus on that one flaw,
until I'm not attracted anymore.

16:07.107 --> 16:09.810
You know? Works perfectly.
How do you think I don't cheat on my wife?

16:09.910 --> 16:13.079
- I thought you did.
- No wonder your marriage is so happy.

16:13.179 --> 16:15.689
Don't talk to me about happiness, okay?
Because... thanks...

16:15.989 --> 16:18.485
- happiness and marriage don't co-exist.
- Bullshit.

16:18.585 --> 16:23.422
There's a reason that Romeo killed himself.
Suicide was the best option for this guy.

16:23.522 --> 16:27.025
- Why?
- No. Romeo set the standard for love.

16:27.125 --> 16:30.635
No, Shakespeare didn't know anything
about love. The guy was a sexual deviant.

16:30.735 --> 16:33.766
He couldn't keep his hands off of himself.
That's why his name was Shakespeare.

16:33.866 --> 16:38.543
It's true. Hardy, Dickens, Longfellow,
all sex-starved pen names.

16:38.643 --> 16:40.205
- E.E. Cummings.
- Updike.

16:40.305 --> 16:42.190
- Margaret Ate-wood.
- Dean Kuuntz.

16:42.290 --> 16:44.710
- Atwood and Koontz.
- Balzac.

16:44.810 --> 16:48.312
Yeah, I see your point. Whiny teens
killing themselves isn't love.

16:48.412 --> 16:52.384
Love is what keeps fucking you
long after the sex has dried up.

16:52.484 --> 16:55.686
Stop! You guys are terrible!
Love is a real thing.

16:55.786 --> 16:58.254
I was watching this Korean
soap opera last night...

16:59.023 --> 17:02.993
- Stop watching that shit.
- No, no, no, you guys are hearing this.

17:03.093 --> 17:07.661
It was an episode of When the Pear
Tree Blossoms, It Also Weeps.

17:08.983 --> 17:11.969
<i>So, basically there's this girl,
Hana and this guy, Da e-jung.</i>

17:12.069 --> 17:15.438
<i>And they've been reunited
after years of separation.</i>

17:15.538 --> 17:18.694
<i>They're like crazy in love.
I mean, it's all tea pouring</i>

17:18.795 --> 17:21.712
<i>and furtive glances, but you can tell
they're like two seconds away</i>

17:21.811 --> 17:26.115
<i>from just ripping each others' kimonos off
and getting seriously freaky.</i>

17:26.214 --> 17:29.886
<i>Oh, God, remember how I told you
how I put myself in other people's stories?</i>

17:29.986 --> 17:30.914
<i>Well...</i>

17:33.122 --> 17:36.825
<i>And why is she here?</i>

17:37.525 --> 17:40.362
<i>But now they're finally back together.</i>

17:40.462 --> 17:43.032
<i>And she realizes
she has to tell him her secret.</i>

17:44.500 --> 17:47.260
<i>She'd been born a man!</i>

17:47.360 --> 17:49.571
<i>So she had to get this operation</i>

17:49.671 --> 17:52.789
<i>to be what she always knew
she was in her heart...</i>

17:52.889 --> 17:55.640
<i>A woman. This is the part
that literally blew my mind.</i>

17:55.740 --> 17:58.979
<i>Instead of rejecting her,
he matches her confession.</i>

17:59.079 --> 18:01.015
<i>He had biologically been a woman</i>

18:01.115 --> 18:04.057
<i>but had science give him
what he always felt he should have...</i>

18:04.157 --> 18:07.521
<i>you know, dude parts.</i>

18:08.789 --> 18:11.007
<i>And they just...</i>

18:11.107 --> 18:13.138
touch hands.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.630
That's love.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.049
Fuck.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.702
Love will always find a way.
Now that's...

18:22.802 --> 18:25.637
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sorry.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.057
<i>Scott could be right...</i>

18:27.157 --> 18:29.948
<i>but then Scott will also say
that there's someone for everyone.</i>

18:30.048 --> 18:31.545
<i>And as much as you may
think that's right,</i>

18:31.645 --> 18:35.668
<i>you can always find that one person that's
so unusual to the natural order of things,</i>

18:35.768 --> 18:40.407
<i>you think that can't be true.
But then, you're wrong again.</i>

18:46.325 --> 18:51.129
<i>Then everywhere you look, it's like
googling awkward engagement photos.</i>

18:51.429 --> 18:54.633
<i>And you realize
you're wrong a third time.</i>

18:55.933 --> 19:00.004
<i>You're that one person,
you're the exception.</i>

19:00.504 --> 19:03.675
<i>There's someone for everyone...</i>

19:03.775 --> 19:07.353
<i>everyone except you.</i>

19:08.779 --> 19:10.684
Is something on your mind?

19:12.323 --> 19:14.051
Oh... it's nothing. It's...

19:14.151 --> 19:17.253
Whenever you say it's nothing,
it is never nothing!

19:17.353 --> 19:18.889
Can we talk about something else?

19:18.989 --> 19:22.226
Well, yeah, sure. I'm gonna have another
prostate exam tomorrow morning.

19:22.326 --> 19:24.294
- Jesus!
- Would you rather talk about that?

19:24.394 --> 19:28.130
No. It's a girl. It's... nothing.

19:28.230 --> 19:31.603
If you're thinking about her, but you can't
figure out how to talk about her,

19:31.703 --> 19:35.137
- it is not nothing!
- I met her at some random fundraiser.

19:35.237 --> 19:38.006
I have no idea how to find her,
so, nothing.

19:38.506 --> 19:40.375
Boy, I didn't know
you were such a quitter.

19:40.475 --> 19:43.979
How am I quitting? I don't know anything
about her I don't know her name.

19:44.079 --> 19:46.348
I don't know where she lives.
I don't know what she does.

19:46.448 --> 19:49.852
- So... nothing.
- You know what Colombo would do?

19:50.952 --> 19:52.103
Prove she's a murderer?

19:52.203 --> 19:56.257
Yeah, but first you'd have to
figure out how to find her!

19:56.457 --> 20:00.395
<i>Granddad was right. I needed
to Colombo the LA charity scene.</i>

20:00.495 --> 20:02.696
<i>So instead of writing,
I started googling.</i>

20:05.499 --> 20:10.003
Scott, you like doing good shit.
Want to come and do some research with me?

20:12.105 --> 20:14.849
<i>All right, get your head in the game.
Got your tie on, feeling smart,</i>

20:14.949 --> 20:18.212
<i>looking good. Let's find this girl.</i>

20:20.913 --> 20:23.716
<i>Charities are ridiculous. They like
to fatten you up with their luncheons</i>

20:23.816 --> 20:26.308
<i>and hors d'oeuvres,
and their dinners, and drinks,</i>

20:26.408 --> 20:30.188
<i>and then they want to sweat it
back out of you with their 5Ks.</i>

20:39.298 --> 20:41.433
Oh, hey, there.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.738
I see you at a lot of these.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.774
You're a very caring person.
We need more guys like you.

20:48.874 --> 20:51.610
<i>The truth is, I'm not as charitable
as I probably should be.</i>

20:51.710 --> 20:54.379
<i>So I did what I do best, make shit up.</i>

20:54.479 --> 20:56.948
I think that charity
defines you as a man.

20:57.148 --> 21:01.351
Yeah, we try to come out whenever we can.
Especially for the... the... art.

21:01.451 --> 21:02.682
It's, you know,
it's one of those things...

21:02.782 --> 21:06.390
<i>I started spewing tales
of adventure, and outreach,</i>

21:06.490 --> 21:10.161
<i>and I didn't mean to lie, but I'm a writer,
it's the way my brain works.</i>

21:10.261 --> 21:12.114
<i>Don't judge me.</i>

21:12.214 --> 21:15.533
<i>God, look at me, I don't even know
what the hell I'm saying right now.</i>

21:15.633 --> 21:18.451
- Nice to meet you guys. Thanks a lot.
- <i>I may have gone too far.</i>

21:18.551 --> 21:23.556
<i>But I'm having fun, they're having fun.
No harm, no foul, right?</i>

21:24.173 --> 21:25.953
<i>But as time went on,
I started to think it didn't matter</i>

21:26.053 --> 21:28.686
<i>how much of my time was donating.</i>

21:29.186 --> 21:33.483
<i>It wasn't doing any good.
My search for her was a lost cause.</i>

21:36.423 --> 21:38.254
That was my best time yet, bro.

21:38.354 --> 21:41.824
Doesn't matter, she's not here.

21:41.924 --> 21:45.111
What? That's what this is about?

21:45.211 --> 21:47.828
Come on, man, you told me
we were doing research here.

21:47.928 --> 21:50.799
<i>Maybe Scott was right. Maybe it was time
to get my life back to normal.</i>

21:50.899 --> 21:53.101
<i>What was I doing?</i>

21:53.501 --> 21:56.170
<i>Hey, buddy. Look,
just checking in on the script.</i>

21:56.270 --> 21:59.640
<i>Hey, seriously, I've got Ashley Tisdale
breathing down my neck.</i>

21:59.740 --> 22:03.372
<i>She called me six times this week
threatening to face-fuck my dog</i>

22:03.472 --> 22:05.846
<i>if she doesn't see a draft.</i>

22:05.946 --> 22:09.183
<i>I must have misjudged her.
She doesn't care about charity at all.</i>

22:09.283 --> 22:11.885
<i>It's actually kind of selfish of her
to put me through all this.</i>

22:11.985 --> 22:14.554
<i>I don't know why I keep trying.</i>

22:17.190 --> 22:19.793
This is $500 a plate.

22:19.893 --> 22:22.028
Meat or vegetarian?

22:22.128 --> 22:25.932
Yeah, we're gonna... can we...
yeah... can we share a plate?

22:26.032 --> 22:27.879
Shared plate fee is $500.

22:29.668 --> 22:31.706
- I'll have the filet.
- Same.

22:31.806 --> 22:32.939
Enough about my work.

22:33.039 --> 22:36.041
And thank you for all the other powerful
testimonials that have been shared today.

22:36.141 --> 22:38.377
I'd like to keep it going
with a truly great man

22:38.477 --> 22:40.379
that I've only recently had
the pleasure of meeting.

22:40.479 --> 22:42.280
I hope I don't embarrass him too much.

22:42.580 --> 22:45.083
He's farmed coconuts in Cambodia.

22:45.183 --> 22:48.154
- <i>Holy shit! That's a real thing?</i>
- He's helped lepers in South America.

22:48.254 --> 22:52.490
Most recently, he singlehandedly
took the Abdu Ali...

22:54.186 --> 22:56.561
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

22:56.661 --> 22:58.162
Bring him up, big hand.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.631
<i>Smile, wave, yeah.</i>

23:00.731 --> 23:03.235
A little help, gang,
let's get him up here.

23:04.035 --> 23:06.370
<i>I'm gonna kill this guy.</i>

23:06.770 --> 23:09.373
Get up here. Get up here.

23:09.473 --> 23:13.765
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Speech! Speech! Yeah!

23:13.865 --> 23:18.147
Thank you. Thank you so much.
It really wasn't anything, though.

23:18.447 --> 23:19.763
It was something.

23:19.863 --> 23:22.480
No, believe me,
I'm not just being modest

23:22.580 --> 23:26.789
when I say I really didn't do anything
that anybody else in my position...

23:26.889 --> 23:28.391
wouldn't have done, so...

23:28.491 --> 23:31.125
Don't worry, you're doing great, baby.

23:31.225 --> 23:34.096
Give yourself
a round of applause, right?

23:34.196 --> 23:35.798
- All right.
- You saved the frogs.

23:35.898 --> 23:37.733
It wasn't just me. It wasn't just me.

23:37.833 --> 23:41.203
It was a lot of people involved
a lot of hands in there.

23:41.503 --> 23:44.122
- It was kind of like a hand orgy.
- <i>Oh, God.</i>

23:44.222 --> 23:47.443
- You're not bombing.
- That's inappropriate.

23:49.977 --> 23:52.480
<i>And suddenly, there she was.</i>

23:57.585 --> 24:00.621
Okay, enjoy your afternoon.

24:02.198 --> 24:03.658
Yeah!

24:03.758 --> 24:06.274
- Nailed it, right?
- Like a coffin.

24:06.374 --> 24:08.861
I had no idea you were
such a philanthropist.

24:08.961 --> 24:11.198
<i>Now would be a good time to come clean.</i>

24:11.298 --> 24:13.350
I'm really just a sucker for a good,
catered meal.

24:13.450 --> 24:16.871
Lot better at these frog events
than the rhesus monkey tapas dinners.

24:16.971 --> 24:19.507
God, not the rhesus monkeys,
they're a slush fund charity.

24:19.607 --> 24:23.036
They sprinkle cute, little monkey photos
all over the place like ruffies,

24:23.136 --> 24:25.658
and then they date-rape
your checkbook. Bastards.

24:26.413 --> 24:28.314
You sound very passionate
about monkey rape.

24:28.414 --> 24:30.280
Like you and frog orgies.

24:32.017 --> 24:34.853
So, you here with the guy?

24:35.653 --> 24:39.825
No, no. I'm here with work.
The company I work for bought a table.

24:39.925 --> 24:43.062
We do urban planning and we're helping
the host foundation with a land-use project.

24:43.162 --> 24:46.460
I mean, it sounds boring,
but it's actually really, really fascinating.

24:46.560 --> 24:48.993
Sorry, I fell asleep, what was that?

24:49.093 --> 24:51.161
Very funny.

24:53.905 --> 24:55.236
Want to go for a walk?

24:57.008 --> 25:00.312
Yeah. Yeah, I can walk.

25:01.012 --> 25:04.348
- After you.
- Okay.

25:05.281 --> 25:07.818
I've got a deadline right now
that I can't seem to focus on.

25:07.918 --> 25:09.152
You should try yoga.

25:09.252 --> 25:11.722
Nature has decided my body
won't bend like that.

25:11.822 --> 25:14.058
Oh, no, but that's why you have
to do it. It's good for you.

25:14.158 --> 25:17.294
I know, I know. I think I avoid things
that are good for me.

25:17.394 --> 25:21.445
Oh, I see, the stereotypical,
self-loathing Good Samaritan.

25:21.545 --> 25:23.259
At least you do good things
for other people.

25:23.359 --> 25:27.103
<i>Okay, last chance, asshole.
Just tell her the truth.</i>

25:29.056 --> 25:30.940
Do you see right there?

25:31.040 --> 25:34.644
Where those two waves collide
and become one?

25:34.744 --> 25:36.545
It's funny.

25:37.045 --> 25:41.884
It's like how... how far
have you traveled?

25:43.184 --> 25:45.228
Years? Thousands of years?

25:45.816 --> 25:48.155
Lifetimes?

25:48.255 --> 25:52.194
For this one moment, right here,
right now, to find each other.

25:52.294 --> 25:54.496
And then to crash...

25:54.596 --> 25:58.200
and go back out to sea
in search of one another again.

26:05.805 --> 26:08.076
I'm just messing with you!

26:09.276 --> 26:10.178
Oh, man.

26:10.278 --> 26:11.478
- I got you.
- You got me.

26:11.578 --> 26:13.434
To crash.

26:15.215 --> 26:16.717
- I was with you.
- I know.

26:16.817 --> 26:19.586
- We had a moment!
- You're romantic! What can you say?

26:20.887 --> 26:23.981
- I'm sorry. You froze up?
- I could have kissed her.

26:24.081 --> 26:27.299
I just didn't want to pull the trigger.
I didn't want to...

26:27.399 --> 26:29.896
ruin it? That doesn't sound right.

26:29.996 --> 26:32.532
Oh, my God. Are you gonna see her again?

26:32.632 --> 26:36.469
No. No. She's got a boyfriend. I'm gonna
get out now before I embarrass myself.

26:36.569 --> 26:38.238
Okay, welcome back, buddy.

26:38.338 --> 26:40.706
That's the first reasonable thing
I've heard you say in weeks.

26:40.806 --> 26:42.745
Hey!

26:42.845 --> 26:45.777
- You!
- Hey!

26:46.278 --> 26:49.377
- What are you doing?
- I'm just walking.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.023
I got a friend with me.
Scott... me and Scott are walking.

26:52.123 --> 26:54.109
Hi, Scott.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.764
Well,

26:57.176 --> 26:59.090
have fun not embarrassing yourself.

26:59.190 --> 27:02.059
- You gonna go check out those waves?
- No, I just pretend.

27:02.159 --> 27:04.462
- Looks cool, though, right? You bought it.
- Looks very cool.

27:06.063 --> 27:07.565
This is a little weird, right?

27:07.665 --> 27:11.235
I know... you meant,
weird that you're stalking me?

27:11.335 --> 27:13.340
I thought you were stalking me.

27:13.440 --> 27:17.622
No, no. If I were stalking you,
you'd never see me. I'm very good at it.

27:17.722 --> 27:21.278
Really? Because I live around the corner,
and I run the neighborhood watch.

27:21.378 --> 27:23.847
So, you have been watching me.

27:23.947 --> 27:25.682
You think you're pretty funny,
don't you?

27:25.782 --> 27:28.118
I think I have promise.

27:30.687 --> 27:33.190
<i>No matter how much your brain
thinks it controls your mouth.</i>

27:33.290 --> 27:36.525
<i>There's always gonna be
that override switch.</i>

27:36.925 --> 27:40.263
So, this might sound kind of nuts.

27:40.363 --> 27:44.166
Maybe we should try running
into each other sometime on purpose?

27:45.266 --> 27:47.236
Did you just ask me on a date?

27:47.336 --> 27:50.472
No, no. I'm just saying
that we keep running into each other.

27:50.572 --> 27:55.409
It feels like, I don't know,
fate wants us to hang out.

27:55.900 --> 27:59.313
Good, because my boyfriend really
hates it when I go out on dates.

27:59.413 --> 28:00.816
Sounds controlling.

28:00.916 --> 28:04.952
Look, I think you're getting
the wrong idea about me as a man.

28:05.052 --> 28:07.155
I think we should just be friends.
That's allowed, right?

28:07.355 --> 28:09.690
Guy and a girl hanging out, no big deal.

28:09.790 --> 28:12.659
No relationship stuff.
I'm lousy at relationship stuff.

28:12.759 --> 28:16.730
Oh, don't worry, I have really,
really low expectations.

28:16.830 --> 28:20.501
Then we should definitely hang out.
I'm really good with low expectations.

28:20.601 --> 28:22.502
- Is that so?
- Yes.

28:22.602 --> 28:25.031
In fact, I can pretty much guarantee
that if we hang out

28:25.131 --> 28:27.174
you're gonna walk away
completely unimpressed.

28:27.274 --> 28:28.962
Well, how could I say no to that?

28:30.076 --> 28:31.644
So it's a date.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.815
Sure, but it's a friend date.

28:38.885 --> 28:39.917
Fuck.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.583
<i>Friend date... friend date.</i>

28:50.728 --> 28:53.298
<i>What the hell is a friend date?</i>

29:01.005 --> 29:03.708
I want him to crawl inside of my vagina.

29:04.108 --> 29:08.909
I left my ovaries abandoned
in the basement like potatoes.

29:10.547 --> 29:13.016
And they started growing arms...

29:13.690 --> 29:14.788
- ...and legs.
- What are you doing? That's rude.

29:14.888 --> 29:17.722
This is a performance. Sit down.

29:17.822 --> 29:20.092
- Not there, back here.
- What is that?

29:21.292 --> 29:23.674
It's a leg. No!

29:25.162 --> 29:26.711
Oh, my God!

29:28.198 --> 29:29.499
Yeah.

29:35.943 --> 29:36.873
Twist ending.

29:37.073 --> 29:40.499
- You are playing with fire.
- No, I'm not.

29:41.211 --> 29:43.679
Thanks. There's nothing wrong
with two adults hanging out as friends.

29:43.779 --> 29:48.117
Men and women can't be friends.
We are squids and squirrels.

29:48.217 --> 29:52.355
- Are you saying we're not friends?
- I'm saying we've slept together.

29:52.455 --> 29:55.424
So? Friends can fuck. Fuck buddies.

29:55.524 --> 29:58.394
Oh, really? Have you fucked Scott?

29:58.494 --> 30:00.029
Not physically.

30:00.129 --> 30:04.033
- What's with the German accent?
- Don't change the subject.

30:04.133 --> 30:07.736
I think you're starting to like this girl,
and you're just setting boundaries,

30:07.836 --> 30:10.305
- so you can push them.
- No, I'm not.

30:10.405 --> 30:13.041
If anything, I'm going out with this girl
to prove she's nothing special.

30:13.141 --> 30:15.076
And she's just as ordinary
as every other girl...

30:15.176 --> 30:17.912
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you're about to say that.

30:18.512 --> 30:20.581
Present company excluded.

30:20.781 --> 30:22.549
I went on a friend date recently.

30:22.849 --> 30:25.054
<i>This one's gonna be weird.</i>

30:26.687 --> 30:29.155
<i>So my friend tells me,</i>

30:29.255 --> 30:32.192
<i>"I'll come over,
we'll watch a movie, hang out."</i>

30:32.292 --> 30:36.212
<i>Sounds normal, right?
Now imagine you're me.</i>

30:36.312 --> 30:38.865
<i>- Oh, God.</i>
- Hi.

30:38.965 --> 30:42.369
<i>And the next thing you know
his tongue is halfway down your throat,</i>

30:42.469 --> 30:44.404
<i>and he doesn't stop there.</i>

30:44.504 --> 30:47.306
- My penis hurts.
- What was that?

30:47.406 --> 30:49.909
- My penis hurts.
- Excuse me?

30:50.009 --> 30:51.641
My penis hurts.

30:51.741 --> 30:54.746
Then you'd better go home
and take care of it.

30:55.046 --> 30:56.862
I want you to take care of it.

30:57.483 --> 30:59.651
That's not gonna happen.

31:00.251 --> 31:02.566
I don't even have to take off my pants.

31:03.355 --> 31:05.523
<i>So my advice to you,
if you really like this girl</i>

31:05.623 --> 31:10.728
<i>is take her somewhere in public,
and don't blow it.</i>

31:14.632 --> 31:16.267
- Wow.
- Wow, is right.

31:16.367 --> 31:18.469
- It looks loud.
- It does.

31:18.569 --> 31:20.405
It looks like an audio gang bang.

31:21.005 --> 31:24.508
That's the name of my band.
That's so weird.

31:27.444 --> 31:28.645
December 8th.

31:28.745 --> 31:31.614
An amethyst wood star hummingbird.

31:31.714 --> 31:34.050
Fastest heartbeat in the world.

31:34.150 --> 31:38.621
Shit, this guy's heart beats so fast,
he's always on the verge of death.

31:38.721 --> 31:40.255
- What?
- Shitty.

31:40.355 --> 31:41.757
That's super shitty.

31:41.957 --> 31:44.960
- You want to play doctor?
- Yes.

31:45.060 --> 31:47.301
Heart beats...
the ancient Chinese believed

31:47.401 --> 31:50.032
you were only given a limited number
of heart beats when you were born.

31:50.132 --> 31:52.520
You can spend them any way you like,
but your heart uses them up

31:52.620 --> 31:56.292
when it beats faster like
when you get angry or excited.

31:57.439 --> 31:59.981
I wonder if it's the same for boners.

32:01.442 --> 32:04.111
No, I can't find it.

32:04.311 --> 32:06.648
<i>Goddamn it, where is her flaw?</i>

32:06.948 --> 32:10.885
Nothing. You don't have a heart.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.756
Miracle of science.

32:14.956 --> 32:18.858
<i>The problem with our little friend date
is that it didn't feel like a friend date.</i>

32:18.958 --> 32:21.228
<i>We're connecting.
I'm showing her a great time.</i>

32:21.328 --> 32:23.431
<i>And at the end of the night,
she's going home to him.</i>

32:23.531 --> 32:26.333
<i>I'm basically Stuffy's wingman.</i>

32:28.134 --> 32:30.670
All right... I gotta get up
early tomorrow.

32:30.770 --> 32:34.675
Tomorrow's a farmer's market day
which means the guy likes to get there early

32:34.775 --> 32:37.628
- for the ripe tomatoes.
- Right, right, yeah.

32:37.728 --> 32:39.912
I gotta go, too.
I got a late-night poker thing.

32:40.012 --> 32:42.648
Cool, all right, well, this was...
this was fun.

32:42.748 --> 32:45.484
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right, I'll see you soon.

32:45.584 --> 32:46.852
- Okay.
- All right, good luck tonight.

32:46.952 --> 32:49.422
- You, too.
- Bye.

32:58.897 --> 33:01.333
What a s... goddamn it!

33:01.433 --> 33:06.881
You dumb, dumb, dumb... dick.
What a... dick!

33:08.506 --> 33:11.209
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. What's up?

33:11.807 --> 33:14.003
My car won't start.

33:21.885 --> 33:23.955
I'm so sorry you missed poker.

33:24.055 --> 33:26.991
No, that's... what are friends for?

33:28.692 --> 33:30.895
Speaking of,
what are you up to on Thursday?

33:30.995 --> 33:35.030
<i>Tell her you're booked,
busy, completely slammed.</i>

33:35.865 --> 33:39.770
Because I've got this charity event
to go to, but no one to go with.

33:39.870 --> 33:43.839
<i>Say anything, you're doing your taxes,
washing your hair. Oh, my God.</i>

33:43.939 --> 33:46.375
- Sounds good.
- Cool.

33:46.475 --> 33:48.444
All right, right on, second friend date.

33:48.544 --> 33:51.147
All right, yeah, yay!

33:51.247 --> 33:54.516
All right, well...
I'll see you on Thursday.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.750
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:55.850 --> 33:57.752
<i>That's a wave goodbye.</i>

33:57.852 --> 34:01.789
<i>I mistake it for... a fucking high-five.</i>

34:01.889 --> 34:06.628
<i>And now, I'm left to hear it echo
for the rest of eternity.</i>

34:06.828 --> 34:10.931
You high-fived her? Nice.

34:12.900 --> 34:16.036
- <i>Lane 13, don't throw the ball.</i>
- Maybe she didn't even notice.

34:17.137 --> 34:19.286
Sometimes when I'm playing with kids,

34:19.387 --> 34:23.210
I go up high, and they just stare at me,
like they don't even want to touch it.

34:23.310 --> 34:26.614
- In what world aren't you a pedophile?
- In this world.

34:26.714 --> 34:28.716
Look, she definitely noticed,
it was terrible.

34:28.815 --> 34:30.984
Well, at least you'll never have
to see her again.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.509
Well...

34:34.219 --> 34:36.610
- Come on, man!
- It's a charity! It's a charity!

34:37.489 --> 34:38.692
Boom!

34:38.792 --> 34:41.862
- Here's the deal, you look like hell.
- Like shit.

34:41.962 --> 34:46.599
Shit, now you're stalking this girl,
and you won't stop talking to us about her.

34:46.699 --> 34:49.402
And you're clearly sexually frustrated.

34:49.502 --> 34:52.536
- Excuse me, hard up.
- Yeah, are you even masturbating properly?

34:52.637 --> 34:55.306
Yes, I'm... no, I don't...
I don't need to masturbate.

34:55.406 --> 34:58.366
- You do need to masturbate.
- This is an intellectual connection...

34:58.466 --> 35:00.512
based on common interests.

35:00.612 --> 35:04.650
For people who have common...
shared interests.

35:04.750 --> 35:06.767
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

35:06.867 --> 35:09.287
Oh, my God. You're falling for her.

35:09.387 --> 35:11.622
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

35:11.722 --> 35:13.957
Look, I'm sorry I don't believe
in the fairy tale.

35:14.057 --> 35:16.973
But your idea of falling in love
is what lonely people tell each other

35:17.073 --> 35:19.164
- and justify sticking it out.
- Lonely people?

35:19.264 --> 35:23.100
No, bullshit, man. Love is amazing.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.503
It connects people. It makes
the whole better than the parts.

35:26.603 --> 35:29.239
- Oh, shit! Sorry!
- <i>Hey, Lane 13, stop throwing the ball.</i>

35:29.339 --> 35:32.811
Look at the divorce rate...
people are petty, emotional whores.

35:32.911 --> 35:36.046
They don't pair off to connect, they do it
to spread their misery, like STD's.

35:37.615 --> 35:41.452
What you're defending is an ideal
that can't exist in an imperfect world.

35:41.952 --> 35:45.220
You are lying to yourself
to try to prove that she's not special.

35:45.320 --> 35:48.791
And that's deceptive... to you,
to her, to your connection.

35:48.891 --> 35:51.827
You can not get to the truth
through deception.

35:52.127 --> 35:56.932
Mall's right, you're gonna ruin this,
because you're a soulless, love hater.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.001
None of you know
what you're talking about.

35:59.101 --> 36:02.639
And don't over-romanticize things, because
you read Love in a Time of Yellow Fever.

36:02.739 --> 36:06.007
- Time of Cholera.
- It's pronounced ch-olera, by the way.

36:06.107 --> 36:07.576
- It's cholera.
- Like chalupa.

36:07.676 --> 36:09.132
So what's your big plan?

36:09.550 --> 36:12.414
You're gonna wreck her relationship
until you get bored and stop calling?

36:12.514 --> 36:14.482
I don't know, Mallory.
I didn't even want to talk about this.

36:14.582 --> 36:18.519
You guys are all getting on my case,
you're dumping your man issues on me.

36:18.619 --> 36:21.088
Did you just say "man issues"?
Man issues? Are you kidding me?

36:21.188 --> 36:22.556
- Mall!
- Oh, shit!

36:22.656 --> 36:25.927
- You're the one that is going out with her!
- <i>Stop throwing the ball, lady!</i>

36:26.027 --> 36:29.897
Why don't you just go already?
Fucking go! Go already!

36:29.997 --> 36:32.466
- Can I just bowl?
- <i>That's it! No more!</i>

36:32.566 --> 36:34.768
<i>Maybe they were right,
I had to end this.</i>

36:34.868 --> 36:38.839
<i>But if I was gonna do it, I was gonna
do it like a gentleman, in person.</i>

36:38.939 --> 36:41.208
<i>Bring on the charity.</i>

36:44.477 --> 36:46.500
Nice suit.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.552
- What kind of charity is this?
- I didn't... I didn't tell you about this?

36:57.990 --> 36:59.891
You're lucky I'm wearing underwear.

37:00.591 --> 37:04.029
I would have pegged you
for a brief guy. No?

37:04.129 --> 37:06.631
- I'm thoroughly impressed.
- Are you?

37:06.731 --> 37:09.401
Should I feel emasculated?

37:09.901 --> 37:11.503
Maybe.

37:13.005 --> 37:15.340
Holy shit.

37:25.149 --> 37:26.717
- You totally did.
- No, I didn't.

37:26.817 --> 37:28.185
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

37:28.285 --> 37:32.289
You made a sound
during the Warrior 3 pose.

37:33.091 --> 37:36.861
- What pose is that?
- Okay. Let me refresh your memory.

37:40.129 --> 37:43.967
Oh, that noise, that was me.
I do it all the time.

37:48.271 --> 37:49.773
What?

37:51.307 --> 37:53.488
What's the deal with you and Stuffy?

37:54.744 --> 37:56.579
That is not his name.

37:56.979 --> 37:59.141
Isn't it, though.

38:00.016 --> 38:02.384
I don't know,
we'll probably get married.

38:02.484 --> 38:04.620
Probably? You don't sound so sure.

38:04.820 --> 38:07.155
No, I mean, we talk about it, you know?

38:07.255 --> 38:10.176
Every few months,
we kind of sit down and we discuss it.

38:10.276 --> 38:12.060
Sounds romantic.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.663
I'm not ready.

38:14.763 --> 38:16.631
Why?

38:16.731 --> 38:20.835
I don't know, I guess I just always
thought it would feel a little different.

38:20.935 --> 38:24.005
You know? Maybe it's not supposed to.

38:24.105 --> 38:27.206
- And I'm fine with that.
- Okay.

38:28.143 --> 38:31.946
Obviously it's none of my business, but when
you say fine, it sounds like comfortable.

38:32.680 --> 38:34.612
What's wrong with being comfortable?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.850
Nothing.

38:36.950 --> 38:38.087
Are you happy?

38:39.286 --> 38:42.152
I'm happy,

38:42.740 --> 38:45.063
and... he is stable...

38:45.163 --> 38:47.851
and he is very passionate about his job,
and my parents love him,

38:47.951 --> 38:50.429
my friends love him,
and he is everything that I need.

38:50.529 --> 38:52.485
What about what you want?

38:52.585 --> 38:55.870
You may check off all the right boxes,
but you can't plan happiness.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.183
Okay, describe your perfect wedding.

39:02.107 --> 39:03.957
I don't know.
I've never thought about it.

39:04.057 --> 39:07.713
San Francisco, outdoor wedding
at one of the city's heart sculptures.

39:07.813 --> 39:12.117
50 people, modern ceremony,
trolley takes us from the heart sculpture

39:12.217 --> 39:15.453
to the Tara for a reception,
and a hell of a lot of Scotch.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.556
Why isn't he the one you're dragging
to yoga and art shows?

39:19.556 --> 39:21.593
Who said I never asked him first?

39:28.933 --> 39:30.991
I like you.

39:32.869 --> 39:34.947
I like you.

39:36.073 --> 39:39.509
- Is that a bad thing?
- Yeah, it's a very bad thing.

39:40.009 --> 39:43.350
I'm saying I have someone that I trust.

39:43.650 --> 39:46.065
Okay? Someone that I've built
a life with and...

39:47.084 --> 39:49.097
God, whatever this is, it's...

39:52.387 --> 39:54.090
It's not gonna change that.

39:59.595 --> 40:00.863
- Yikes.
- Yikes.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.665
Okay.

40:02.765 --> 40:06.468
- Wow, Debbie Downer.
- Okay.

40:09.604 --> 40:11.673
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

40:11.773 --> 40:12.808
I'll see you.

40:14.909 --> 40:19.414
- Okay... so, you should probably stretch.
- Yeah.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.637
All right, enough.

41:30.181 --> 41:33.519
- Don't be such a pussy.
- Yeah, man, don't be such a pussy.

41:33.619 --> 41:35.487
- Really, Scott?
- What?

41:35.587 --> 41:37.388
No, Scotty's right.

41:37.488 --> 41:40.458
Do you know how long I waited
for you to actually fall for a girl?

41:40.558 --> 41:42.293
And now you're just puttering around.

41:42.393 --> 41:45.362
I'm not the one staying
in a bad relationship. That's not on me.

41:45.462 --> 41:48.798
When I met your grandmother,
she was engaged to an Italian.

41:49.098 --> 41:52.302
You think that wop knew what to do
with her? I had to steal her!

41:52.402 --> 41:56.606
I saved her! And when I die,
I want to be buried right on top of her.

41:56.706 --> 42:00.243
Yeah, that's... that's pretty romantic.

42:00.343 --> 42:03.795
And you, you won't even fight
for the girl you love.

42:03.895 --> 42:07.483
Don't let the death of your mother
haunt you for the rest of your life.

42:07.583 --> 42:10.286
- Get on with things!
- That has nothing to do with this.

42:10.386 --> 42:15.290
Look, love is like your 401k,
it matches your investment.

42:15.390 --> 42:17.960
You love a little, you're loved little.

42:18.460 --> 42:20.895
All right,
I think we need to tell him the story.

42:20.995 --> 42:23.932
What story? Wait, do you guys
hang out without me?

42:24.032 --> 42:28.002
Look, I never had a granddad, okay?
Don't be selfish. Tell him.

42:28.102 --> 42:30.238
It was 1943.

42:30.338 --> 42:33.041
I was in San Diego, I was in the Navy.

42:35.810 --> 42:37.144
<i>Then I saw her.</i>

42:37.544 --> 42:40.981
<i>Every man in the bar
was lined up to talk to her,</i>

42:41.081 --> 42:43.950
<i>but I didn't let that deter me.</i>

42:44.050 --> 42:46.953
<i>Her eyes sparkled.</i>

42:47.053 --> 42:51.315
<i>Her lips were like two perfect,
red roses.</i>

42:51.415 --> 42:52.896
<i>It was fate,</i>

42:53.631 --> 42:55.953
<i>and I couldn't deny fate.</i>

42:56.496 --> 42:58.798
<i>Time stood still has we danced.</i>

42:58.898 --> 43:00.638
<i>The music, the lights...</i>

43:01.885 --> 43:04.888
<i>she felt like sunshine in my arms.</i>

43:04.988 --> 43:09.709
<i>She looked like a princess...
and I was her prince.</i>

43:09.809 --> 43:12.445
<i>It was magic.</i>

43:12.545 --> 43:14.780
<i>Granddad, this sounds
like a Disney cartoon.</i>

43:14.880 --> 43:20.185
<i>Really? A Disney cartoon, you pussy?
This was a man stuff.</i>

43:20.285 --> 43:25.156
<i>I shipped out the next day
and I never thought I'd see her again.</i>

43:25.256 --> 43:28.560
<i>My dearest, I do not know
if I will ever see you again,</i>

43:28.660 --> 43:32.466
<i>and as you know, I am already engaged.
I am sorry, my love,</i>

43:32.566 --> 43:35.466
<i>if we could be together,
I would turn the world on its side.</i>

43:35.566 --> 43:38.368
<i>But I am to be wed
on the 3rd of January.</i>

43:38.468 --> 43:43.607
<i>And at that exact moment
a fleet of U-boats blasted our ship.</i>

43:43.707 --> 43:46.977
<i>But not even Nazis
can stand in the way of love.</i>

43:47.077 --> 43:50.214
<i>I had to get back to her.
I swam shark-infested waters.</i>

43:50.414 --> 43:54.450
<i>Scaled the sea cliffs
of Canada's Labrador Coast.</i>

43:54.550 --> 43:59.355
<i>Raced across plains, deserts,
and burial grounds.</i>

43:59.755 --> 44:03.393
<i>It was the longest
three days of my life.</i>

44:08.365 --> 44:11.333
<i>Excusi, what the hell
do you think you're doing?</i>

44:19.607 --> 44:22.210
<i>That kiss changed everything.</i>

44:22.310 --> 44:26.581
<i>And after that,
the Allies turned the tide of war,</i>

44:26.681 --> 44:29.751
<i>and we lived happily ever after.</i>

44:30.719 --> 44:32.486
That's a beautiful story, Granddad.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.188
- It's not your granddad.
- Whatever.

44:34.288 --> 44:38.159
See, women, they want to be fought over.
They like to feel desired.

44:38.259 --> 44:41.528
Just seems like if she felt half
of what I feel, she'd explode.

44:41.628 --> 44:44.631
Well, you feel all these things, but...
I mean, you're not doin g anything.

44:44.831 --> 44:48.236
- Which makes him a what, Scotty?
- A pussy.

44:48.536 --> 44:51.471
That's right. You're a pussy.

45:17.429 --> 45:19.065
Hey! What's wrong with you?

45:19.165 --> 45:20.932
- I'm sorry!
- Where'd that rock come from?

45:21.032 --> 45:23.102
- Wait, who are you?
- Some pussy just broke our window.

45:23.202 --> 45:25.037
- What are you doing down there?
- Sorry, sorry!

45:25.137 --> 45:28.173
- Hey! What's going on?
- Sorry, guys, I'm looking for her.

45:28.273 --> 45:30.891
- Why?
- Yeah, why?

45:30.991 --> 45:35.615
I was just seeing if you wanted
to do something... with me.

45:36.314 --> 45:37.626
Like what?

45:39.516 --> 45:42.286
- Anything.
- What time is it?

45:42.986 --> 45:45.790
- Midnight or 1:00.
- It's kind of late.

45:45.890 --> 45:48.926
- Yeah, it is kind of late.
- Thanks. Thank you.

45:50.761 --> 45:53.096
But is it too late?

45:56.632 --> 46:00.050
So... what now?

46:00.271 --> 46:02.115
I don't know.

46:02.215 --> 46:05.275
I was kind of improvising back there.
I didn't think you were gonna come with me.

46:05.375 --> 46:07.543
So, you don't do this all the time?

46:07.643 --> 46:10.212
Well, you'd think,
given how smooth that was.

46:11.112 --> 46:12.582
You spend a lot of time down here?

46:12.682 --> 46:15.784
Training to be a longshoreman
in case that charity circuit dries up?

46:15.884 --> 46:18.921
Honestly, I don't think
they're ready for this much man.

46:19.021 --> 46:20.756
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

46:21.056 --> 46:24.660
I did spend a lot of time down here, though,
as a kid. My granddad took me here a lot.

46:24.760 --> 46:28.141
We'd walk up and down the docks
we'd pick a boat, pretend to own it,

46:28.241 --> 46:31.199
name it, and then list
all the places you'd sail to.

46:31.999 --> 46:33.401
My granddad was great at it, too.

46:33.501 --> 46:37.839
He'd pick names like Helen of Troy
or the S.S. Excalibur.

46:38.039 --> 46:42.210
Sail to places like Sea of Cortez
and Zanzibar, you know?

46:42.310 --> 46:44.111
And what about you?

46:44.311 --> 46:46.947
I was the captain of the S.S. Heman,

46:47.047 --> 46:48.968
and we had set a course
for Castle Grayskull.

46:49.883 --> 46:51.051
- Nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

46:51.151 --> 46:53.688
Bit of a novice when it came
to charting aquatic courses.

46:56.023 --> 46:58.197
Oh, you two must be close.

46:58.297 --> 47:00.561
Well, he pretty much raised me.

47:00.761 --> 47:02.629
Yeah?

47:04.497 --> 47:06.533
Yeah.

47:11.337 --> 47:12.906
Okay,

47:13.006 --> 47:16.109
you own one of these boats.
Top place, where you going?

47:16.209 --> 47:19.812
Oh, gosh, I gotta say Costa Rica.

47:19.912 --> 47:21.713
- Costa Rica? Really, why?
- Yeah.

47:22.013 --> 47:24.350
I don't know, I guess I've always
just wanted to go there.

47:24.450 --> 47:29.521
You know... exciting nightlife,
culture everywhere. Tropical fruits.

47:29.621 --> 47:34.526
Okay, so... your top destination
has endless exotic fruits,

47:34.626 --> 47:36.312
- a place that never sleeps...
- Yeah.

47:36.412 --> 47:41.132
...and a population
that predominantly speaks Spanish.

47:41.799 --> 47:43.715
Okay...

47:43.815 --> 47:47.472
I can do this. I can do this right now.

47:48.172 --> 47:50.440
Follow me.

47:52.623 --> 47:54.912
Very clever.

47:57.649 --> 48:00.083
Life is too short, you know?

48:02.519 --> 48:04.654
Holding a grudge against the Captain?

48:04.754 --> 48:06.356
I don't know what you're supposed
to do with a grudge.

48:06.456 --> 48:09.526
- Do tell.
- I'm kidding.

48:09.626 --> 48:12.392
No, you're not,
there's totally a story there.

48:17.133 --> 48:18.908
You're really not gonna tell me?

48:19.935 --> 48:23.805
Okay, come on,
help me find a birthday card.

48:27.676 --> 48:30.188
My dearest daughter...

48:30.288 --> 48:33.082
may you live all the days
of your life... happy birthday.

48:33.182 --> 48:38.253
If Christmas isn't in your heart...
you'll never find it under a tree.

48:38.353 --> 48:41.289
- Happy birthday.
- This isn't a joke.

48:41.389 --> 48:43.787
- Who's birthday is it?
- Mine.

48:44.459 --> 48:46.828
- It's your birthday?
- As of 30 minutes ago.

48:46.928 --> 48:48.630
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

48:48.730 --> 48:51.733
Well... happy birthday.

48:52.933 --> 48:55.069
What? No cash? You're a cheap ass.

48:55.169 --> 48:57.504
Isn't buying a birthday card
for yourself a little depressing?

48:57.604 --> 48:59.640
Should we get one of those
"cheer up" ones?

48:59.740 --> 49:03.877
It's... it's not supposed to be from me.
It's supposed to be from my dad.

49:05.445 --> 49:10.884
When I was little, he died a couple days
before my birthday. So...

49:10.984 --> 49:14.588
- I'm sorry... what happened?
- He killed himself.

49:15.288 --> 49:18.557
But then, on my birthday,
I got a card from him.

49:19.057 --> 49:20.792
He had sent it before he died,

49:20.892 --> 49:24.631
and he'd said that he was sorry
and that he loved me.

49:27.200 --> 49:30.035
Love is a little messed up sometimes.

49:30.970 --> 49:33.111
So, you know, every year on my birthday

49:33.211 --> 49:37.498
I pick out a card
that I think he would get me...

49:37.598 --> 49:40.040
and I sign it from him.

49:40.145 --> 49:42.714
And this might be it.

50:06.603 --> 50:10.357
- No boobs, no bone?
- It wasn't that kind of kiss.

50:10.457 --> 50:13.977
It was emotional, but wasn't about sex.

50:14.077 --> 50:16.912
I'm so confused. I don't know
how to translate what you just said.

50:17.012 --> 50:18.831
What did her tongue taste like?

50:19.081 --> 50:20.883
What are you doing
with your girlfriend there?

50:20.983 --> 50:23.319
Deflating her, and this is
my carpool lane associate.

50:23.419 --> 50:24.687
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, do you want to finish her off?

50:24.787 --> 50:26.656
Yeah, sure.

50:26.756 --> 50:29.791
Hey! Whoa, stop!
You're lucky I have two of these.

50:29.891 --> 50:33.628
It's my view that if you don't screw her soon
you're gonna screw it up for both of you.

50:33.928 --> 50:37.831
You know what? You would both be
better off if you just forget about her.

50:37.931 --> 50:42.436
You know, I have a short story that's exactly
perfect for this moment right now.

50:42.536 --> 50:44.720
Mallory, do you want to come
help me find it?

50:44.920 --> 50:47.809
I don't know. I don't think anyone's
ever gone in your van on purpose

50:47.909 --> 50:50.142
- so I'm not gonna be the first.
- What the eff!

50:50.342 --> 50:53.781
Lyle! If you're gonna move your house,
you have to tell everybody in the group.

50:53.881 --> 50:56.917
Can we just stop calling it a house?
Do you mind?

50:57.017 --> 50:58.919
Sorry, Scott, do you want to come
in here and help me find something?

50:59.019 --> 51:02.598
It's got a steering wheel, it can
make turns. It can go to different states.

51:02.698 --> 51:05.291
- Careful.
- It has a license plate.

51:06.083 --> 51:07.027
Pass.

51:07.127 --> 51:10.963
It's like I was saying,
sexual tension can cloud a man's mind.

51:11.063 --> 51:14.500
When the dick takes over,
the brain shuts off.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.341
- Are we still... are we on this?
- Both sides.

51:16.441 --> 51:19.672
It's writers 101, women want romance,
men want climax.

51:19.772 --> 51:23.676
One good orgasm, this guy's got all
his questions answered. Every single one.

51:23.776 --> 51:27.379
I'm sorry. Do men honestly think
that sex is the answer to everything?

51:27.479 --> 51:28.513
- Yes.
- Yeah.

51:28.613 --> 51:32.150
And it's also a time-tested shortcut,
since the dawn of man.

51:32.250 --> 51:35.720
If you can bang a girl, and forget
about her, then she's forgettable.

51:35.820 --> 51:37.722
Yeah, that's poetry.

51:37.822 --> 51:40.859
Hey, just forget about her. Move on.

51:40.959 --> 51:43.395
Hey, he cannot forget about her, okay?

51:43.495 --> 51:46.663
He's already built her up
as his mysterious forbidden fruit.

51:46.763 --> 51:48.534
So, unless he unravels the mystery,

51:48.634 --> 51:51.870
she'll haunt him, you know,
until the end of time.

51:52.870 --> 51:55.940
I've got a story about a serf. Okay?

51:56.540 --> 51:59.010
<i>The serf was in love with the maiden...</i>

52:00.410 --> 52:04.748
<i>but he never told her,
so she married another.</i>

52:08.584 --> 52:13.056
<i>The serf vowed to forget her,
and to never be a slave to love again.</i>

52:14.724 --> 52:18.795
<i>Became a cold bastard,
he was unfulfilled. He was empty.</i>

52:23.682 --> 52:27.702
<i>There had to be more. So he became
a monk, looking for the Divine.</i>

52:27.802 --> 52:30.672
<i>He ran to ends of the earth,
searching for the spiritual fulfillment</i>

52:30.772 --> 52:33.800
<i>of the boundless and the everlasting.</i>

52:34.909 --> 52:36.911
<i>After many years had passed,</i>

52:37.111 --> 52:39.481
<i>and he'd finally cleared his mind
of all the earthly thoughts</i>

52:39.581 --> 52:43.883
<i>when he opened his mouth for the first
word that popped into his mind.</i>

52:43.983 --> 52:47.287
<i>And it was... her name.</i>

52:47.387 --> 52:49.323
Gee, Grandpa, that was great.

52:49.423 --> 52:52.437
Why don't you tell the story about the time
you got drunk and tried to finger me.

52:52.537 --> 52:53.962
Okay, here it is.

52:54.062 --> 52:57.699
It's about this Russian astronaut who fell
in love with the mistress of the czar.

52:57.799 --> 53:01.034
- Lyle, I'm telling a story.
- Yeah, no, it's the same story...

53:01.134 --> 53:03.569
because he couldn't have
the girl he loved, right?

53:03.669 --> 53:05.484
So he ends up taking the space mission

53:05.584 --> 53:09.709
and he ends up floating off in space,
alone... without her, going crazy.

53:09.809 --> 53:11.278
Are you done? Are you finished?

53:11.378 --> 53:13.947
Well, he'll probably run out
of oxygen at some point.

53:14.047 --> 53:15.916
So then, that would probably be the end.

53:16.016 --> 53:19.719
Well, the point of my story is that
you can't just forget about her...

53:19.819 --> 53:23.555
- you have to answer the question.
- Yeah, mine, too. It's the same story.

53:23.655 --> 53:26.792
And then after that,
you suffocate out in space.

53:27.492 --> 53:29.495
Same story.

53:31.597 --> 53:34.438
<i>Frogs are becoming extinct
throughout the rainforest.</i>

53:34.538 --> 53:35.701
<i>But what's more interesting...</i>

53:35.801 --> 53:39.570
<i>I never thought online dating
was for me until I tried it on a dare.</i>

54:11.305 --> 54:15.200
- Hello.
- <i>All right, I need to talk. Are you busy?</i>

54:15.605 --> 54:17.106
No, no.

54:17.806 --> 54:20.142
This friend thing has gotten off-track.

54:20.242 --> 54:22.477
- It was the kiss, wasn't it?
- It's everything.

54:22.577 --> 54:26.448
I've got such a huge pit in my stomach.
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

54:26.548 --> 54:29.385
So... it was a good kiss?

54:29.485 --> 54:33.913
That is irrelevant, okay?
That shouldn't...

54:34.013 --> 54:36.625
- We can't.
- I know. I know, it's messing me up, too.

54:38.325 --> 54:40.161
You think we should just have sex,
get it out of our system?

54:40.261 --> 54:41.530
We are not having sex!

54:41.630 --> 54:43.965
Well, you're not offering any solutions.
I'm just trying to be helpful.

54:44.065 --> 54:46.935
Helpful to yourself.
How does you getting laid help me?

54:47.035 --> 54:50.238
I've explored every other option.
I can't just be friends.

54:50.338 --> 54:54.500
I'm not getting a sex change and I refuse
to die out in space or join a monastery.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.644
How are those the only options?

54:56.744 --> 54:59.480
- I'm open to suggestions.
- Well, I don't have any.

54:59.580 --> 55:03.450
That doesn't mean sex.
All right, the kiss was a mistake.

55:03.550 --> 55:08.876
Look, if this thing between us,
if it's nothing, if it's just infatuation,

55:09.722 --> 55:12.692
- maybe sex will cure it?
- Stop it.

55:12.992 --> 55:16.429
- So, what will it be?
- Some cold turkey.

55:16.529 --> 55:19.132
No, I don't want cold turkey.

55:19.232 --> 55:23.370
I want a hot... open-face sandwich.

55:23.470 --> 55:25.939
No, nothing hot.

55:26.039 --> 55:29.042
I want something steamy.

55:29.242 --> 55:31.576
- I want soup.
- He'll have gazpacho.

55:31.676 --> 55:34.145
We don't do gazpacho.
The menus are right there.

55:34.245 --> 55:36.749
Okay, I'll pick. I want ice cream.

55:36.849 --> 55:41.319
Oh, something sweet?
And a little bit bad for you.

55:41.419 --> 55:43.254
We're out of ice cream.

55:43.354 --> 55:45.274
- Of course, you are.
- Sorry.

55:45.374 --> 55:50.028
Could you bring us
some whipped cream and jelly?

55:50.428 --> 55:52.296
Whatever.

55:54.332 --> 55:57.667
Wow, what do you got
up your sleeve, Copperfield?

55:59.753 --> 56:02.672
Are you on that new condiment diet?

56:03.907 --> 56:05.576
- There you go.
- Thank you.

56:12.515 --> 56:14.217
Okay, I'm getting excited now.

56:16.219 --> 56:18.105
VoilÃÂ .

56:19.556 --> 56:21.191
Ice cream.

57:40.032 --> 57:41.434
Oh, God.

57:41.684 --> 57:44.102
<i>My whole life,
I've felt guilty after sex.</i>

57:44.202 --> 57:47.271
<i>Guilty for everything I said
and done to get there.</i>

57:47.371 --> 57:49.657
- So.
- So.

57:49.757 --> 57:52.831
<i>But the thing I learned is when you
actually care about the person,</i>

57:52.931 --> 57:55.747
<i>you don't feel guilty.</i>

58:37.553 --> 58:40.055
Welcome back, Cap.

58:42.624 --> 58:44.559
You know I couldn't even...

58:44.659 --> 58:48.730
I couldn't even eat this stuff
until last night. Look at me now.

58:49.380 --> 58:52.784
- I hope you don't think it means something.
- Of course, it means something.

58:52.884 --> 58:56.655
You bet your ass, it means something.
You feel it, too, I can see it.

58:56.755 --> 59:00.574
Yeah, I feel something, but I told you
last night, this can't happen.

59:00.874 --> 59:02.743
Come on, you can't say
you don't feel differently now.

59:02.843 --> 59:06.225
Yeah, but it always feels like this
at first. Like with my boyfriend,

59:06.325 --> 59:09.882
and all the other guys before him,
and then eventually it becomes...

59:10.082 --> 59:11.853
ordinary.

59:11.953 --> 59:12.981
Ordinary?

59:14.154 --> 59:15.923
You think last night was ordinary?

59:16.023 --> 59:20.793
No, I think last night was amazing.
But that's not the point.

59:20.893 --> 59:25.298
It was amazing, so what's the problem?
Screw those guys, they're not me.

59:25.398 --> 59:28.170
Yeah, but what about the next guy?
Is that gonna be amazing?

59:28.270 --> 59:31.838
- The next guy? There's already a next guy?
- No, the metaphorical next guy.

59:31.938 --> 59:34.107
God, now I gotta go meet
my boyfriend for lunch.

59:34.207 --> 59:36.641
Your boyfriend?
Wait, wait you gonna tell him about us?

59:36.741 --> 59:39.845
What? No, I'm not gonna tell him
about us. That I screwed up?

59:39.945 --> 59:43.982
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
It's the truth! Do you want me to tell him?

59:44.082 --> 59:47.743
No, I don't want you to tell him.
I gotta go.

59:51.657 --> 59:54.009
Fine! You know what?
I thought this was special.

59:54.109 --> 59:58.430
You're telling me it's ordinary. I guess
I was wrong. Enjoy all your next guys.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.224
Sounds like you gotta give her more space.
You know? You're crowding her.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.484
- Yeah.
- Shut up, you don't get to talk.

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.488
- The dude's got a point... got a point.
- What do you mean, he has a point?

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:26.657
You're the one that told me
sleeping with her was the only way.

01:00:26.757 --> 01:00:29.493
No, I said that sleeping with her
would give you the answer.

01:00:29.593 --> 01:00:32.229
I didn't know you were gonna lose it
and start acting needy.

01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:34.864
I'm not needy. We had a connection.

01:00:34.964 --> 01:00:38.000
So, dude, you take a girl home
for the first time and sleep with her,

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:40.637
and you wake up in the morning
and she's trying to...

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:44.673
you know, re-arrange your life.
How... how would you react to that?

01:00:44.973 --> 01:00:46.819
You gotta fix that, man.

01:00:46.919 --> 01:00:49.277
Shit, I'm needy.

01:00:49.427 --> 01:00:52.090
Hey, it's me.

01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:56.133
- Truce lunch?
- I didn't know we were at war.

01:00:56.233 --> 01:00:59.455
Well, I guess this is me
waving the white flag.

01:01:00.255 --> 01:01:02.123
I'm glad you called, actually.

01:01:02.823 --> 01:01:03.858
You are?

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:08.162
Look, I am so sorry about the other morning.
I completely panicked, you know?

01:01:08.262 --> 01:01:11.397
No, I'm sorry. It's completely me,
I was so out of line.

01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:13.766
You freaked out a little bit,
and then that made me freak out

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:16.220
and then you freaked out more.
And everything just got, you know...

01:01:16.993 --> 01:01:18.871
freaky.

01:01:18.971 --> 01:01:22.076
I know, but maybe
you were right about things.

01:01:23.576 --> 01:01:26.476
About you being in something
for the wrong reason

01:01:26.576 --> 01:01:29.684
or feeling differently about us?
Or both?

01:01:31.684 --> 01:01:34.720
Give me one good reason
why you and I belong together.

01:01:37.022 --> 01:01:41.602
I feel like the universe is pushing me
in a certain direction. And...

01:01:42.673 --> 01:01:45.617
God... All right, you know when...

01:01:45.717 --> 01:01:48.683
your friends tell you stories about their
break-up or their pet dying, whatever?

01:01:48.783 --> 01:01:50.935
I do this thing where I imagine
myself in the story.

01:01:51.035 --> 01:01:54.338
I feel like I can't do it now,
without you in it with me.

01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:56.775
- Oh, my God.
- It's a sign.

01:01:57.657 --> 01:02:00.345
- It's not a sign.
- It is. Trust me.

01:02:00.545 --> 01:02:04.148
- I do, that's what scares me.
- Hey! I knew that was you.

01:02:04.248 --> 01:02:06.217
<i>Shit, it's the last guy I need to see.</i>

01:02:06.317 --> 01:02:10.016
Where you been? I haven't seen you
at any of the monkey dinners.

01:02:10.116 --> 01:02:12.455
Yeah. My schedule's been crazy.

01:02:12.555 --> 01:02:15.692
And I'm talking to the event coordinator
at the Assist-a-Sister craft sale

01:02:15.792 --> 01:02:18.643
but she said that she'd never
even heard of you.

01:02:18.996 --> 01:02:21.832
I'm all, screw that, sister,
he's on the board of directors.

01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:25.868
Then she showed me her business card
and she's on the board of directors.

01:02:29.555 --> 01:02:33.642
<i>Liar's block... it's like writer's block,
but for shitheads.</i>

01:02:33.742 --> 01:02:38.798
I'm not technically as involved in the charity
scene as I may have led you to believe.

01:02:38.898 --> 01:02:42.518
- What does that mean?
- Well, charity events don't pay the bills.

01:02:42.718 --> 01:02:45.867
I go when I can, I just don't go
as often as I'd like to.

01:02:48.056 --> 01:02:49.657
Or claim to.

01:02:49.757 --> 01:02:53.495
- What do you do, exactly?
- I'm a writer.

01:02:53.595 --> 01:02:54.996
You've been lying this whole time.

01:02:55.096 --> 01:02:59.334
No, no, no, no, don't think of it like that.
Although it is technically accurate.

01:02:59.434 --> 01:03:03.074
Africa? Rainforest? The frogs?

01:03:03.525 --> 01:03:07.575
I want to take your drink
and throw it in your face.

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.881
I did help with the frogs!

01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:16.717
I shouldn't be here.
God, I'm such an idiot.

01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:19.003
I really did!
I met a frog scientist at...

01:03:19.103 --> 01:03:22.356
I don't care about the frogs.
Fuck the frogs!

01:03:30.496 --> 01:03:33.933
You look like shit. What are you,
method writing or something?

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:38.070
- I'm a fraud.
- Don't go to a dark place, man.

01:03:38.170 --> 01:03:41.850
RomComs are supposed
to be funny, remember?

01:03:42.407 --> 01:03:43.889
Look,

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:47.078
it's not that hard, man. Check it out.

01:03:47.178 --> 01:03:50.449
Boy meets girl, right?
Shit happens, right?

01:03:50.649 --> 01:03:54.352
Boy, girl, do it... happily ever after.

01:03:54.452 --> 01:03:57.272
That's not the way the world
works, Bryan. It's a shit show.

01:03:58.323 --> 01:04:01.558
And you didn't draw hair on the girl,
I don't know which one is the dude.

01:04:01.658 --> 01:04:05.878
Fine, I'll give you hair. What kind of hair
you want? You want a BeyoncÃ© look?

01:04:05.978 --> 01:04:08.532
You want like a Dolly Parton thing?
Puff, you want a flat-top?

01:04:08.632 --> 01:04:10.234
No, you know what?
That's perfect, that's what love is.

01:04:10.334 --> 01:04:12.852
It's this simple thing in our brains
and you try and put it in the world

01:04:12.952 --> 01:04:14.334
and it gets decimated.

01:04:14.434 --> 01:04:19.475
You can't even draw love on a napkin,
without it looking like two dudes 69-ing.

01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:22.745
You're right.
You can't put love on paper.

01:04:22.845 --> 01:04:25.749
You have a better chance of bleeding
your heart out through a paper cut

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:28.818
- then through a pen.
- What? Is that deep?

01:04:28.918 --> 01:04:30.920
No, it's from another client's script.

01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:34.257
I don't think it's good,
but everybody wants it.

01:04:34.357 --> 01:04:37.410
Bidding all day on it,
because he finished the script.

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:42.031
RomComs aren't true.
They're what we wish were true.

01:04:42.131 --> 01:04:47.403
And right now, what I wish was true,
is that you would meet your damn deadline!

01:04:47.503 --> 01:04:50.405
And I really wish we weren't
having this conversation.

01:04:50.505 --> 01:04:55.309
Okay. So, what I'm seeing
is you're distracted,

01:04:55.409 --> 01:04:59.180
can't write, can't meet your deadline,
because of a girl!

01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:02.316
So let's get a new girl!

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:06.788
How about that? Good?
Distraction from your distraction?

01:05:06.888 --> 01:05:08.789
Let's head over to this party
I was gonna go to.

01:05:08.889 --> 01:05:10.591
I don't know
if my heart's into it, Bryan.

01:05:10.691 --> 01:05:12.393
Fuck your heart, man!

01:05:12.693 --> 01:05:16.406
I'm talking about Champagne and blow jobs!
Let's go meet some girls.

01:05:16.506 --> 01:05:19.299
Let's roll them up.
Let's glaze 'em like doughnuts.

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:23.537
No shit, cross my heart,
I tell the guy to get out of my house.

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:27.166
He leaves a book on the table.
I make a call, two weeks later...

01:05:27.366 --> 01:05:29.472
Hunger Games.

01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:33.580
Hey, man. Tequila?

01:05:34.847 --> 01:05:36.299
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:40.119
<i>The girl I love is probably screwing
some other guy right now.</i>

01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:42.722
<i>Probably sweat-staining
the sheets with pleasure.</i>

01:05:42.822 --> 01:05:47.025
<i>Coining new words
with orgasm after orgasm.</i>

01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:51.029
<i>God knows that's what I'd be doing.</i>

01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:57.168
Hey, man. I think I'm gonna take off.

01:05:57.268 --> 01:06:00.040
- You didn't find a distraction?
- No.

01:06:01.239 --> 01:06:03.058
<i>I honestly don't know what I felt.</i>

01:06:03.875 --> 01:06:07.870
<i>But It was kind of like my heart
was drowning.</i>

01:06:10.247 --> 01:06:13.575
Maybe she's not the one.
Maybe my body and my instincts,

01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:15.786
and the whole universe
are just lying to me.

01:06:15.886 --> 01:06:18.622
I don't even know
what makes sense anymore.

01:06:18.722 --> 01:06:22.492
Come on, man, please open up.
Just talk to me for a second?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.597
All right, all right, look...

01:06:28.182 --> 01:06:32.568
Sometimes when I'm searching for,
you know, porn to masturbate to,

01:06:32.668 --> 01:06:35.083
if I'm looking for girls that are a lot
like the girl that I'm seeing,

01:06:35.183 --> 01:06:37.680
that's a good sign. All right?

01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:41.104
- Okay.
- So, ask yourself,

01:06:41.204 --> 01:06:44.014
if you do that. I gotta go, man,
I'm in the middle of something.

01:06:44.114 --> 01:06:49.818
Lyle! That's not advice. Come on, man,
give me like five minutes, be a friend.

01:06:50.018 --> 01:06:52.894
- All right.
- Look, look, look...

01:06:52.994 --> 01:06:56.392
You've gotta go to her.
Tell her how you feel.

01:06:56.492 --> 01:06:59.794
- She knows how I feel.
- But did you tell her you love her?

01:06:59.894 --> 01:07:02.981
I don't think she believes in love.
To be honest, I don't know if I do.

01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:06.988
Doesn't matter, as long as you feel it.

01:07:15.643 --> 01:07:19.247
Look, she loves these little cat kisses.
They're so cute.

01:07:19.347 --> 01:07:23.057
Look, I have needs and you're blocking
those needs right now.

01:07:23.157 --> 01:07:26.687
Go talk to Mallory,
she loves your little issues.

01:07:27.187 --> 01:07:29.901
Thank you. Thank you.

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:33.626
She won't return any of my calls.
She's ignoring my texts.

01:07:33.726 --> 01:07:36.095
Why are girls so crazy?

01:07:36.195 --> 01:07:38.231
Men, men make us crazy.

01:07:38.331 --> 01:07:40.633
You know what I mean, though?
You're with this crazy person,

01:07:40.733 --> 01:07:44.398
and they're making you crazy.
You just want to shake them

01:07:44.498 --> 01:07:47.318
- and show them what you see!
- Yeah, I've been there.

01:07:47.418 --> 01:07:49.626
How'd you handle it?

01:07:50.226 --> 01:07:53.946
- Me? I didn't do anything.
- Nothing?

01:07:54.046 --> 01:07:56.181
You must have done something.
How strong were your feelings?

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:58.925
- Pretty strong.
- The guy from the play?

01:07:59.025 --> 01:08:01.720
No, he was too needy.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.562
Some other guy.

01:08:05.656 --> 01:08:07.949
All right, if you had to go back
and do it all over again,

01:08:08.049 --> 01:08:11.862
- would you tell him how you felt?
- I don't know. It might hurt.

01:08:11.962 --> 01:08:14.432
Yeah, but doesn't this hurt?
What if he felt the same way?

01:08:14.532 --> 01:08:15.801
I love you.

01:08:17.535 --> 01:08:20.523
- Shit.
- I love you.

01:08:20.622 --> 01:08:22.907
I should've told you.
I thought you knew.

01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:35.278
And that's why I never told you.

01:08:44.526 --> 01:08:49.999
- Where's our script, bitch?
- Yeah, where's our script?

01:08:51.367 --> 01:08:57.139
I'm gonna slit your throat
and penetrate your mind.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.792
Yeah.

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:14.348
- Hello?
- <i>I need to tell you something.</i>

01:09:14.788 --> 01:09:17.292
- I'm engaged.
- What?

01:09:17.392 --> 01:09:20.493
I've been a total mess and I'm sorry.
It's been all my fault.

01:09:20.594 --> 01:09:23.663
- I've projected all of my fears onto you.
- Why would you do this?

01:09:23.764 --> 01:09:27.948
Because he's the one steady thing
in my life. It's time.

01:09:28.049 --> 01:09:32.471
It's time? That's your reason?
You don't love this guy.

01:09:33.581 --> 01:09:36.076
What are you doing? God! Stop it!

01:09:36.376 --> 01:09:39.979
This is a mistake. I know you don't see it
right now, but I promise you will regret it.

01:09:40.078 --> 01:09:42.747
- Oh, my God.
- I love you.

01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:46.853
Are you out of your mind? Oh, my God!

01:09:46.953 --> 01:09:49.322
- You better find my goddamn ring!
- I'll buy you another ring!

01:09:49.471 --> 01:09:52.551
- All right, move! I'll find your ring.
- Jesus Christ! Watch where you're stepping!

01:09:52.652 --> 01:09:55.672
- If it was bigger, it'd be easier to find.
- Oh, really? Do you hear that a lot?

01:09:55.772 --> 01:09:56.814
Here!

01:09:56.914 --> 01:10:00.181
Jesus Christ! Why do you have
to complicate everything?

01:10:00.281 --> 01:10:03.736
Me? You called me!
Why didn't you just text?

01:10:04.636 --> 01:10:07.270
I don't want you to marry this guy.
Why him? Why now?

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:10.099
- Give me one good reason.
- It makes sense.

01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:12.277
- What do you want to hear?
- That you love him.

01:10:12.377 --> 01:10:15.388
You want to hear that I love you.

01:10:15.488 --> 01:10:17.448
I can't give you that.

01:10:28.058 --> 01:10:32.079
I want to put my face in a waffle iron.

01:10:32.179 --> 01:10:35.797
- I want to jump in front of a Maglev train.
- No, you don't.

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:41.605
Maybe you're pitying yourself
a little too much here.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:45.842
Pitying? It's not pity. I'm hurt.

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:50.614
Okay, but what about... her?

01:10:50.714 --> 01:10:53.666
I mean, you know, you put her
in a pretty tough spot here.

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:57.219
She's marrying a guy she doesn't love.
She put herself in that spot.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:10:59.788
Yeah, and you went after a girl
that has a boyfriend.

01:11:00.388 --> 01:11:02.607
I mean, you kind of
brought that on yourself.

01:11:02.707 --> 01:11:06.762
If you really love her,
maybe you should... let her go.

01:11:06.962 --> 01:11:11.500
- Who's side are you on?
- I'm... I'm on love's side.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.274
Oh, my God...

01:11:13.374 --> 01:11:19.180
Scott, I don't need some romanticized
metaphor right now, all right?

01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.410
Okay, just trying to help.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:26.214
Really? And where'd you gain
this amazing insight into love?

01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:28.383
You've been in love with the guy
from the book store for two years.

01:11:28.483 --> 01:11:31.851
You haven't done shit. At least
I tried, I put myself out there.

01:11:31.951 --> 01:11:33.487
Look, Vince is obviously straight.

01:11:33.587 --> 01:11:38.325
No gay man thinks that Terminator
is the most romantic movie of all time.

01:11:38.425 --> 01:11:42.662
Plus, I did the whole
Ghost-ditto line thing on him.

01:11:43.138 --> 01:11:46.533
Nothing. So I think it's pretty safe
to say if he's gay, he'd be all over this.

01:11:46.633 --> 01:11:50.236
You're lying to yourself. You run around
leaving this romance book for people to find.

01:11:50.336 --> 01:11:53.738
That doesn't make you an expert in love.

01:11:54.689 --> 01:11:56.275
That book is my art.

01:11:56.375 --> 01:12:00.047
Okay, I bet not one person
who found it ever read it.

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:07.659
Wait a second, you never read it?
You told me you read it.

01:12:09.071 --> 01:12:11.823
Don't make your Scott face.
If it's that important to you, I'll read it.

01:12:11.923 --> 01:12:14.448
If it's that important to me?
I got pink eye

01:12:14.548 --> 01:12:17.629
- from a charity dunk tank for you.
- You didn't write it.

01:12:17.729 --> 01:12:22.033
Oh, my God, you are so self-absorbed!
That book changed my life!

01:12:22.133 --> 01:12:25.937
It inspired me to write!
To... to accept myself, Jesus!

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:27.814
- Come on, man, don't do this. This is...
- Christ!

01:12:27.914 --> 01:12:30.738
I've seen you run through Mallory.
I've seen you dismiss Lyle.

01:12:30.838 --> 01:12:33.796
You barely ever visit Granddad.
The entire time I thought I was exempt.

01:12:33.896 --> 01:12:36.179
For some reason,
I thought I was the exception.

01:12:36.279 --> 01:12:39.584
- Really? You want to go there over a book?
- What's the name of the book?

01:12:44.888 --> 01:12:47.356
E... Eternal Love and Leprosy.

01:12:47.956 --> 01:12:50.460
I'm kidding!
It's... Love and the Time of Cholera.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.429
Love in the Time of Cholera.

01:12:53.529 --> 01:12:54.775
90 percent.

01:12:56.464 --> 01:12:58.934
Well, Mr. Screenwriter...

01:12:59.034 --> 01:13:03.306
I am just so glad
that I'm not in the movie of your life.

01:13:03.406 --> 01:13:07.615
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're the lead, right? You're the star.

01:13:09.111 --> 01:13:12.555
But it'll never be a great romance.
Do you want to know why?

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:16.385
It's only about one person.

01:13:20.014 --> 01:13:22.824
You didn't write the book!

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.508
Hey!

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:35.469
Hey! It's me!

01:13:37.103 --> 01:13:39.740
Jesus! Did you just throw a rock at me?

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:42.443
Shit! Head's up!

01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:45.645
Sorry. You can't marry him.

01:13:46.245 --> 01:13:49.082
You want logic, I'll give you logic.

01:13:49.182 --> 01:13:51.251
One, you don't love him.

01:13:51.351 --> 01:13:54.317
Jesus, do not do this.

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:58.891
The sex is better with me.
I know, I have first-hand experience.

01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:00.627
- Who is it?
- It's no one!

01:14:00.727 --> 01:14:04.329
It's not no one! I'm the one!

01:14:04.429 --> 01:14:05.668
Third,

01:14:05.768 --> 01:14:10.032
he hates hearts. He hates museum hearts.

01:14:10.132 --> 01:14:13.105
He's gonna hate San Francisco hearts.

01:14:13.205 --> 01:14:16.241
He hates my heart,
because my heart smokes...

01:14:16.341 --> 01:14:17.743
What's going on out here?

01:14:17.843 --> 01:14:22.079
Oh, God, look at him!
Your kids are gonna look like that?

01:14:22.179 --> 01:14:25.432
- Look, do you want me to call the cops?
- No, just go inside, he's drunk.

01:14:25.532 --> 01:14:28.052
- Call 'em, bitch. Call the cops!
- Look, I swear to God, I'm gonna...

01:14:28.152 --> 01:14:32.202
Gonna what? Stand up there
and talk me to death or come down here

01:14:32.302 --> 01:14:35.258
- and stuff my balls in your mouth.
- Right.

01:14:35.358 --> 01:14:38.562
Third! I love you.

01:14:39.162 --> 01:14:42.874
There's no one else, I know.

01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:45.653
I've looked.

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:47.990
Have you got a problem, punk?

01:14:48.490 --> 01:14:50.639
You're trying to harass me
and my fiancee, are you?

01:14:50.739 --> 01:14:51.707
She doesn't love you, man.

01:14:51.807 --> 01:14:53.543
<i>Let me show you what happens
when you're drunk.</i>

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.331
Beat his ass!

01:15:00.315 --> 01:15:02.668
Yeah!

01:15:02.768 --> 01:15:05.120
<i>Unfortunately,
this is what actually happens.</i>

01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.589
She doesn't love you, man.

01:15:15.597 --> 01:15:17.632
What is wrong with you?

01:15:18.532 --> 01:15:21.726
I just bought these at Barney's!

01:15:25.706 --> 01:15:28.109
He asked me to move in with him.

01:15:28.209 --> 01:15:30.711
We're gonna elope in December.

01:15:35.582 --> 01:15:38.952
- You hate me.
- I don't hate you.

01:15:41.521 --> 01:15:44.094
I nothing you.

01:16:02.341 --> 01:16:04.777
Oh, Scott.

01:16:04.877 --> 01:16:08.379
I know I owe you an apology,
but I can't talk right now.

01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:11.483
- I had a really rough night.
- <i>If there's one universal law.</i>..

01:16:11.583 --> 01:16:16.087
<i>beyond relativity and string theory
and M-theory, it's this.</i>

01:16:16.387 --> 01:16:18.940
- <i>Things can always get worse.</i>
- Granddad died.

01:16:21.037 --> 01:16:23.060
I'm sorry.

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:03.999
<i>So death comes as a reminder.</i>

01:17:04.099 --> 01:17:07.969
<i>It grabs us and shakes us,
opens our eyes.</i>

01:17:12.006 --> 01:17:17.645
<i>And our focus is changed...
shifted... revised.</i>

01:17:28.422 --> 01:17:29.917
<i>To the finder of this book...</i>

01:17:30.017 --> 01:17:34.294
<i>This book changed my life,
so I wanted to share it with you.</i>

01:17:34.394 --> 01:17:37.664
<i>I'm gonna tell you this one from my point
of view so you can put yourself in there.</i>

01:17:37.764 --> 01:17:39.666
<i>...the song, the memory...</i>

01:17:39.766 --> 01:17:41.281
<i>So the story goes,</i>

01:17:41.381 --> 01:17:44.852
<i>a guy falls in love with a girl
the second he meets her,</i>

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.767
<i>but it takes him a lifetime
to finally get together.</i>

01:17:47.867 --> 01:17:50.317
<i>When they do, they end up on a boat,</i>

01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:54.570
<i>and they realize the only way they can
stay together is to never go ashore,</i>

01:17:54.670 --> 01:17:58.274
<i>so they raise the yellow cholera flag
so no port will take them,</i>

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:01.321
<i>and they drift out to sea until the end.</i>

01:18:01.421 --> 01:18:03.343
<i>And it makes you realize,</i>

01:18:03.443 --> 01:18:06.291
<i>there are people in your life
so important</i>

01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:09.527
<i>that they dwarf everything else.</i>

01:18:10.642 --> 01:18:13.898
<i>And it's up to you
to figure out who they are.</i>

01:18:16.935 --> 01:18:19.484
<i>If you had to give up everything else,</i>

01:18:19.584 --> 01:18:22.351
<i>and spend the rest of your days
on a boat...</i>

01:18:22.451 --> 01:18:27.144
<i>who are the must-haves?
The ones you can't live without.</i>

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:35.202
<i>Figure out your own list</i>

01:18:35.302 --> 01:18:39.834
<i>and then do everything you can to let them
know how much they mean to you.</i>

01:18:46.162 --> 01:18:49.331
<i>I hope it's not too late for me.</i>

01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:52.034
<i>Okay, first things first.</i>

01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:59.108
<i>Split-personality RomCom, let's do it.</i>

01:19:04.146 --> 01:19:07.344
Just because I wear a badge,
doesn't mean I can't feel.

01:19:07.444 --> 01:19:11.119
It's too late, he's Heisman-ed you
into the friend zone.

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:14.990
Oh, it's useless,
she could never love us.

01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:18.193
You're just saying that,
because we're crazy.

01:19:18.293 --> 01:19:20.061
Oh, he's no different than us.

01:19:20.161 --> 01:19:22.731
Everyone has all these
different faces to hide behind.

01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:26.400
Love is just as crazy.
It changes everything, okay?

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:29.486
It could be like a red,
red rose, or a machete.

01:19:29.586 --> 01:19:33.607
It's like what they say,
love is a many splintered thing.

01:19:33.707 --> 01:19:35.642
It's not splintered.

01:19:35.742 --> 01:19:40.190
It's "Love is a many splendored thing."
Splintered sounds painful.

01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:42.765
It's that, too.

01:19:42.865 --> 01:19:46.355
Yeah, it's that, too.

01:19:57.697 --> 01:20:00.099
<i>I don't really know
what's happening here.</i>

01:20:00.199 --> 01:20:02.348
<i>I just finished a screenplay.
It's very emotional.</i>

01:20:07.322 --> 01:20:10.109
<i>All right, time to celebrate.</i>

01:20:11.143 --> 01:20:12.277
<i>Scott and I had made up.</i>

01:20:12.377 --> 01:20:14.379
- Congratulations, man.
- Thank you.

01:20:14.479 --> 01:20:18.551
I got you something.
100 Years of Solitude.

01:20:18.651 --> 01:20:21.052
- Oh, God.
- Don't read too deeply into the title.

01:20:21.152 --> 01:20:25.990
I'm pretty sure there's only a small chance
that you'll die alone yourself.

01:20:28.126 --> 01:20:32.663
Yeah, well, that's the good thing
about being a writer, right?

01:20:32.763 --> 01:20:35.569
You get to choose your own ending.

01:20:36.366 --> 01:20:38.521
<i>Mallory had finally given
her friend-date a real shot.</i>

01:20:38.621 --> 01:20:42.172
- I'm gonna get us drinks.
- Great.

01:20:42.272 --> 01:20:44.295
You guys are cute.

01:20:45.241 --> 01:20:47.111
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:20:47.211 --> 01:20:49.513
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:20:49.613 --> 01:20:52.315
Get out of here, I'm busy.

01:20:53.784 --> 01:20:56.019
Okay, we're good.

01:20:56.119 --> 01:20:58.716
- <i>Samson and Lyle were...</i>
- Gentlemen.

01:20:58.816 --> 01:20:59.855
<i>- Samson and Lyle.</i>
- Congratulations.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:02.369
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you for coming.

01:21:02.469 --> 01:21:04.005
<i>And Bryan was elated
to cash his commission.</i>

01:21:04.105 --> 01:21:07.329
Congratulations. Great work,
and not a moment too soon

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:12.151
because they pushed the start date up
for the action movie two weeks.

01:21:12.251 --> 01:21:13.569
That deserves a drink.

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:16.624
I watched Terminator again.

01:21:16.724 --> 01:21:18.365
Oh, yeah.

01:21:18.465 --> 01:21:22.343
Yeah, and you're right.
I'm sorry, you're right.

01:21:22.443 --> 01:21:26.381
It's actually a...
weirdly romantic film.

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:30.027
Cheers. So...

01:21:30.627 --> 01:21:32.214
I wanted to personally come down

01:21:32.314 --> 01:21:36.261
and give you a first class ticket
to six weeks

01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:38.734
of first-class Malaysian pussy.

01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:43.444
You know, sometimes I can get something
stuck in my head a certain way,

01:21:43.544 --> 01:21:45.757
you know, and then...

01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:51.053
I can miss all the other ways
it can be.

01:21:52.706 --> 01:21:54.774
Ditto.

01:21:56.843 --> 01:21:58.913
No, no, no, no.

01:21:59.013 --> 01:22:01.675
Don't open it. I'll get more money.

01:22:02.632 --> 01:22:05.599
<i>Even with my boat pretty full...</i>

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.755
<i>There was still something missing.</i>

01:22:12.458 --> 01:22:14.993
<i>Time to write my own ending.</i>

01:22:16.777 --> 01:22:19.664
<i>I've got a wedding to stop.</i>

01:22:21.132 --> 01:22:25.971
<i>All those 5Ks I ran finally paid off,
seeing as how I have to outrun this clichÃ©.</i>

01:22:30.475 --> 01:22:32.943
Hey! Don't you have a bunch
of heart sculptures somewhere?

01:22:33.443 --> 01:22:37.081
- Oh, yeah, buddy, we have hearts.
- Great. Take me there.

01:22:37.181 --> 01:22:39.283
- Which one?
- All of them.

01:22:39.383 --> 01:22:43.047
- Are you crazy or something?
- Something.

01:23:17.352 --> 01:23:19.582
- Sorry, guys, this cab's taken.
- Yes, we know.

01:23:19.682 --> 01:23:23.192
- Gabriel told us what you are doing.
- We want to see all the hearts, too.

01:23:34.235 --> 01:23:37.572
She's the only thing I think about.
And I can't get her out of my head.

01:23:37.672 --> 01:23:42.261
- Sounds like she doesn't love him.
- That... that's what...

01:23:42.361 --> 01:23:43.610
I like you guys.

01:23:48.214 --> 01:23:49.282
Excuse me,

01:23:49.382 --> 01:23:53.719
did you happen to see a wedding here earlier
with a girl that was like... perfect?

01:23:54.019 --> 01:23:56.456
I'll see what you want me
to see for 50 bucks.

01:23:56.756 --> 01:23:58.692
Okay, let's go, guys!

01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:04.283
Wait, you're gonna bust up
some dude's wedding? Hell, yeah.

01:24:04.383 --> 01:24:08.732
Sometimes when you're chasing love it feels
like the whole world is on your side.

01:24:17.943 --> 01:24:22.481
We are gathered here today
to celebrate a marriage.

01:24:25.249 --> 01:24:27.662
If there's anyone here
who objects to this union

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:30.070
let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

01:24:30.170 --> 01:24:32.624
That's the last one
at the end of the pier.

01:24:32.774 --> 01:24:34.726
She's gotta be there.

01:24:55.646 --> 01:24:58.282
<i>Even my imagination
took a kick to the balls.</i>

01:25:05.821 --> 01:25:09.491
- Gabriel, what's that big arrow?
- That's Cupid's Bow.

01:25:09.691 --> 01:25:13.112
- Why didn't we go there?
- You specifically said heart sculptures.

01:25:13.212 --> 01:25:17.433
- That, my friend, is not a heart.
- But those shoot hearts.

01:25:18.033 --> 01:25:19.868
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:25:42.289 --> 01:25:44.154
Hi.

01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:47.686
What are you doing here?

01:25:48.635 --> 01:25:52.199
- I came to stop you.
- Oh, then you're a little late.

01:25:52.299 --> 01:25:55.235
Yes, I can see that.

01:25:55.335 --> 01:25:57.972
You know, there's like 100
of these heart statues.

01:25:58.072 --> 01:26:02.041
I wrote a whole speech on the plane.
I was gonna make a big scene.

01:26:02.341 --> 01:26:04.611
Yeah, well, you need
to work on your timing.

01:26:06.379 --> 01:26:07.647
Did you marry him?

01:26:09.782 --> 01:26:11.718
No.

01:26:11.818 --> 01:26:14.420
I was standing there looking at him,

01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:18.323
and it just felt wrong...
for both of us.

01:26:18.723 --> 01:26:21.159
- Maybe that's a sign.
- Stop.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:24.229
All right, this is serious.

01:26:24.329 --> 01:26:26.231
You shouldn't even be here.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.600
Look, I know you're upset with me,

01:26:28.700 --> 01:26:33.255
but I feel like we met each other
at a very strange point in our lives.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:38.208
I think you were in the wrong relationship.
I couldn't sustain one if I had to.

01:26:38.308 --> 01:26:41.455
But I feel...

01:26:41.953 --> 01:26:44.578
something strong.

01:26:44.678 --> 01:26:46.186
I feel different.

01:26:47.518 --> 01:26:51.437
And... I think we deserve
to find out what that is.

01:26:52.589 --> 01:26:56.627
We deserve to be as far away
from each other as possible.

01:26:56.927 --> 01:26:59.029
Wait! Why? Why?

01:26:59.129 --> 01:27:00.964
Look at us!

01:27:01.064 --> 01:27:05.502
You lie about saving frogs
and cleaning Third World drinking water!

01:27:05.602 --> 01:27:08.154
And I cheat on boyfriends,
that's who we are.

01:27:08.254 --> 01:27:10.607
We're both disasters,
neither of us deserve love!

01:27:10.707 --> 01:27:13.443
Then we're perfect for each other.

01:27:13.543 --> 01:27:18.213
We're flawed. We're a shit show.
We're two people full of flaws.

01:27:18.313 --> 01:27:22.217
Oh, my God. That's your pitch?

01:27:22.417 --> 01:27:25.153
Damn, dude, that shit ain't workin'.

01:27:25.253 --> 01:27:27.874
Look, love is fucked up,
it's confusing, and it's terrifying,

01:27:27.974 --> 01:27:30.826
and it's... it's painful, it sucks.

01:27:30.976 --> 01:27:33.894
But I'm looking at you right now...

01:27:34.962 --> 01:27:36.864
I want to risk it.

01:27:36.964 --> 01:27:39.601
I know it could be a mistake. I know
we could make each other miserable.

01:27:39.701 --> 01:27:44.573
But if we have even the slightest
chance of being that one time...

01:27:45.273 --> 01:27:49.110
I'm willing to regret you
for the rest of my life.

01:27:50.879 --> 01:27:53.446
God, I hate you.

01:27:55.849 --> 01:27:57.317
I love you, too.

01:27:57.417 --> 01:28:01.788
I really hate you. I hate you.

01:28:23.608 --> 01:28:27.090
<i>Everybody has their own ideas about love.
They have their philosophies,</i>

01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:30.348
<i>and facts and rules of how it works
and what you're supposed to do,</i>

01:28:30.448 --> 01:28:33.270
<i>but none of that shit matters
because love isn't a thinking thing,</i>

01:28:33.370 --> 01:28:35.185
<i>it's a feeling thing</i>

01:28:35.285 --> 01:28:38.472
<i>and this is what it felt like for me.</i>

01:28:44.062 --> 01:28:48.469
<i>Live your own story, and don't worry,
I promise I won't put myself in it.</i>

01:28:48.569 --> 01:28:51.838
<i>Pour some honey on the world</i>

01:28:51.938 --> 01:28:57.200
<i>For sweeter soul before you go</i>

01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:01.437
<i>Paint some color in your heart</i>

01:29:01.537 --> 01:29:06.071
<i>You won't end what you don't stop</i>

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:20.559
<i>In faith plan this all one night</i>

01:29:20.659 --> 01:29:25.929
<i>I was drunk, you were dressed in white</i>

01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:29.750
<i>And we talk down on the beach</i>

01:29:29.850 --> 01:29:34.288
<i>I slurred my speech, you kiss my cheek</i>

01:29:45.619 --> 01:29:49.010
<i>Hearts and rainbows in the sky</i>

01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:51.501
<i>For you and I</i>

01:29:51.601 --> 01:29:54.666
<i>Oh, my mind</i>

01:29:55.175 --> 01:29:58.536
<i>You know I love to see you smile</i>

01:29:58.636 --> 01:30:01.162
<i>Each and every time</i>

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:05.090
<i>It blows my mind</i>

01:30:14.673 --> 01:30:17.838
<i>And you know that life goes on</i>

01:30:17.938 --> 01:30:23.385
<i>With the tops and downs
its twists and shouts</i>

01:30:24.224 --> 01:30:27.462
<i>Help me understand the world</i>

01:30:27.562 --> 01:30:32.978
<i>You're the sweeter soul I've ever known</i>

01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:46.621
<i>Now there's color in my heart</i>

01:30:46.721 --> 01:30:51.190
<i>For a brand new start, here we go</i>

01:31:02.632 --> 01:31:06.083
<i>Hearts and rainbows in the sky</i>

01:31:06.183 --> 01:31:08.559
<i>For you and I</i>

01:31:08.659 --> 01:31:11.704
<i>Oh, my mind</i>

01:31:12.338 --> 01:31:15.690
<i>You know I love to see you smile</i>

01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:18.221
<i>Each and every time</i>

01:31:18.321 --> 01:31:21.190
<i>It blows my mind</i>

01:31:22.121 --> 01:31:25.529
<i>Hearts and rainbows in the sky</i>

01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:28.088
<i>For you and I</i>

01:31:28.188 --> 01:31:31.204
<i>Oh, my mind</i>

01:31:31.804 --> 01:31:35.220
<i>You know I love to see you smile, woman</i>

01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.664
<i>Each and every time, woman</i>

01:31:37.764 --> 01:31:40.616
<i>It blows my mind</i>
