23:58.562 --> 24:01.815
having a kid is just as expensive
as having a mortgage.

24:02.941 --> 24:06.570
All right, let's see
if we can hear a heartbeat.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.864
Now, just relax.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.164
Starting on the nursery yet?

24:17.247 --> 24:20.959
No, we're in an efficiency so there
really isn't room for a separate nursery.

24:22.252 --> 24:26.089
So you're having a baby
<i>and </i>looking for a new apartment?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.883
Sheesh, that's no fun.

24:28.508 --> 24:30.218
Are you finding a heartbeat, or...

24:30.302 --> 24:34.222
[doctor] They've also raised the price
on formula, so keep that in mind.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.140
Uh-oh.

24:35.515 --> 24:36.349
What?

24:37.476 --> 24:38.477
Twins.

24:38.935 --> 24:39.978
-[Henrietta] What?
-What?

24:40.061 --> 24:42.939
-Yep. Two heartbeats.
-You gotta be kidding me.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.441
-[loud thud]
-Jack!

25:01.041 --> 25:02.626
-Hiya, Jack.
-Flo.

25:02.709 --> 25:04.419
[chuckles] How's Hollywood treating you?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.129
Oh, you know, I'm living the dream.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.964
-Mm-hm.
-Listen, I got a favor to ask you.

25:08.048 --> 25:11.510
I'm a little short on cash,
but I could really use a costume.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.928
What kind of costume?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.522
[siren wailing in distance]

25:47.212 --> 25:48.547
-One, please.
-[man] Um...

25:49.130 --> 25:52.342
Uh, you don't have to pay, Officer.
You can just go right in.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.097
Damn right, I don't have to pay.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.312
[big band music playing]

27:14.215 --> 27:15.216
How are you today?

27:16.301 --> 27:17.302
I'm fine, how are you?

27:18.470 --> 27:19.929
-I'm well.
-Yeah?

27:22.599 --> 27:23.767
You got any money, honey?

27:24.934 --> 27:25.810
Sure do.

27:26.603 --> 27:27.687
I bet you do.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.612
[gun clicks]

27:36.196 --> 27:37.113
Get out of here.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.073
Shit!

27:38.615 --> 27:40.075
[men clamoring]

27:42.077 --> 27:43.161
You're coming with me.

27:43.411 --> 27:44.454
[panting]

27:48.291 --> 27:49.250
Shit.

27:49.834 --> 27:50.710
Walk.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.381
-Are you going to put me in jail?
-Shut up. Keep walking.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.802
-Got a squad car somewhere, or--
-I said can it!

27:59.552 --> 28:02.472
-We're going right around the corner.
-Schwab's is around the corner.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.891
What, you don't like Schwab's?

28:05.558 --> 28:06.643
What?

28:17.153 --> 28:19.114
Could you just do me a favor
and clue me in here?

28:19.447 --> 28:20.782
Am I getting arrested?

28:22.117 --> 28:24.035
Listen, you're gonna get honest
with me real fast

28:24.119 --> 28:26.579
or I'm taking you downtown
to the lock-up.

28:27.831 --> 28:28.873
Hey, Jack, it's ready.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.334
Let's go.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.716
Hey, Jack, what's with the get-up?

28:38.133 --> 28:40.135
Nothing. It's just my uniform.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.554
I wear it when I'm on duty.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.808
I'll have a cup of coffee.
My friend here will have a Shirley Temple.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.603
That's awfully rude, don't you think?

28:50.687 --> 28:51.646
Explain yourself.

28:52.522 --> 28:55.608
-What do you want me to say?
-Start from the beginning, why don't you?

28:59.738 --> 29:00.572
Okay.

29:02.031 --> 29:04.367
I moved to LA after I got out
of the service.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.871
I wanted to be a writer.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.331
Still do.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.001
I wrote a script, you know?

29:14.085 --> 29:17.338
Screenplay about Peg Entwistle,

29:17.839 --> 29:22.135
a girl who jumped off the Hollywood sign
because the town wouldn't accept her.

29:22.635 --> 29:23.678
[scoffs]

29:24.053 --> 29:27.682
I know the feeling, so I wrote about it.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.143
Sold my script, too.

29:31.352 --> 29:33.146
But a hundred bucks...

29:33.980 --> 29:34.814
ain't much,

29:35.899 --> 29:39.903
and a studio ain't gonna put
a black man under contract.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.070
I got...

29:43.698 --> 29:44.741
Can I smoke?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.368
Yeah, go ahead.

29:47.952 --> 29:48.828
Thank you.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.296
You need money?

29:59.547 --> 30:00.799
I get a dollar a script

30:01.466 --> 30:04.260
down at the Lincoln Theater,
writing vaudeville sketches.

30:04.803 --> 30:05.762
But that's once a week,

30:05.845 --> 30:09.849
so the way I see it,
gotta turn these tricks.

30:09.933 --> 30:14.854
And I can't go cruise Pershing Square
or the farmer's market, okay?

30:14.938 --> 30:19.651
Cops will arrest me just for loitering,
so I turn my tricks up at Joe's place.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.277
Beats washing dishes,

30:22.195 --> 30:23.363
and I like doing it.

30:23.863 --> 30:27.158
Why not get paid for something that
feels good that you was gonna do anyways?

30:31.955 --> 30:33.331
I'm discerning.

30:33.414 --> 30:37.293
-My tricks gotta be good-looking, clean--
-So, you're a gigolo.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.294
I'm a writer.

30:38.711 --> 30:40.296
Call it whatever you want.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.924
I ain't ashamed.

30:44.467 --> 30:45.844
I know who I am.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.892
Now, Miss Shirley here is delicious.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.812
What if I told you I could offer you
an opportunity?

30:56.729 --> 30:58.982
A job, doing what you're doing, but safer.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.693
What the hell kind of cop are you?

31:01.776 --> 31:03.778
I know a fella who owns a gas station.

31:03.862 --> 31:07.490
You pump gas, some customers you do
a little more, you know what I'm saying.

31:07.574 --> 31:08.950
Pay is good, very good.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.410
More than what you're charging.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.621
And if you wanted to,
you could just do guys.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.083
You ain't no real cop.

31:17.166 --> 31:20.003
Also, I do wanna ask you.
I gotta ask you...

31:21.170 --> 31:22.255
Pall Malls.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.924
Could you make it with a woman
if you had to?

31:26.301 --> 31:27.135
Yeah.

31:27.927 --> 31:31.180
Sure, I can fake it. Ain't that what most
fellas do with their wives anyways?

31:31.264 --> 31:32.640
-He's paying for it.
-Okay.

31:33.224 --> 31:35.226
I'm gonna take you
to meet my friend Ernie.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.896
First, you're right, I'm not a cop.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.607
I'm an actor.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.192
But, until that moment just then,

31:44.319 --> 31:45.737
you thought I was a cop, didn't you?

31:46.529 --> 31:49.073
What I mean is,
you would cast me as a cop...

31:49.574 --> 31:50.617
right?

31:55.455 --> 31:58.082
Sweet beans in a basket.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.293
He'll do the guy stuff?

32:00.501 --> 32:01.336
Ask him.

32:01.794 --> 32:02.795
If the price is right.

32:05.089 --> 32:08.885
-50-50.
-[scoffs] I'm worth more than that, 60-40.

32:08.968 --> 32:09.844
[chuckles]

32:11.137 --> 32:13.139
I like this kid. Enterprising.

32:15.433 --> 32:16.267
Okay, deal.

32:17.185 --> 32:18.019
Ernie West.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.647
-Archie Coleman.
-You're gonna do a lot of business, kid.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.106
I can tell just by looking at you.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.150
What's the password again?

32:24.817 --> 32:26.027
"Dreamland."

32:26.110 --> 32:27.445
[bell dinging]

32:27.528 --> 32:29.238
[Ernie] He's all yours, go get him.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.335
I knew you'd be back.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.796
They always come back.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.223
How's it going?

32:58.851 --> 32:59.936
Can I help you?

33:01.187 --> 33:03.773
Uh, yeah, I want to go to Wonderland.

33:04.649 --> 33:05.650
The street?

33:06.109 --> 33:08.569
Oh, that's up there on Laurel Canyon.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.949
[scoffs] You mean Dreamland?

33:13.866 --> 33:15.618
Yeah. Dreamland.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.536
Okay.

33:17.870 --> 33:19.288
What can I do for you?

33:19.372 --> 33:22.125
Uh, I don't know.
Are there-- are there options here, or...

33:22.417 --> 33:24.002
You're not interested in a black man?

33:24.085 --> 33:25.795
No, I'm just a little nervous.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.880
[chuckling]

33:31.175 --> 33:32.010
What's your name?

33:33.344 --> 33:35.054
Roy. Roy Fitzgerald.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.305
Archie.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.897
[bell dinging]

33:48.651 --> 33:49.902
[keys jangling]

34:01.372 --> 34:02.415
[door closes]

34:04.417 --> 34:05.293
This your place?

34:05.835 --> 34:06.669
Yeah.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.713
I'm renting month-to-month.

34:08.796 --> 34:11.549
I know it ain't much,
but it's all I can afford right now.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.426
What do you want?

34:16.721 --> 34:19.057
-What do you mean?
-I mean what do you want to do...

34:19.974 --> 34:20.975
to me?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.105
Or what do you want me to do to you?

34:26.856 --> 34:29.108
[scoffs] Oh, you're, uh...

34:30.443 --> 34:32.111
I like how straightforward you are.

34:32.361 --> 34:34.489
[chuckles] Yeah.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.825
Well, I just wanna make sure you get
your money's worth, Mr. Roy Fitzgerald.

34:38.910 --> 34:39.952
Can I ask you something?

34:41.162 --> 34:42.038
Where are you from?

34:42.747 --> 34:45.249
Illinois. Little town called Winnetka.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.170
Fitzgerald's my stepdad,
Scherer's my real dad's name.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.424
I came out here
to reconnect with him, but...

34:53.883 --> 34:55.259
it didn't really wash.

35:00.014 --> 35:01.641
What about you? Where are you from?

35:02.225 --> 35:03.309
Where am I from?

35:05.853 --> 35:06.938
Memphis.

35:13.361 --> 35:18.116
So, what's a good-looking guy
like yourself doing paying for affection?

35:21.285 --> 35:23.371
Why not just go to those joints
on Main Street?

35:23.871 --> 35:25.081
Harold to the 1-2-3...

35:25.164 --> 35:26.999
Cookie, you're making me nervous.
[chuckles]

35:27.083 --> 35:28.251
[sighs]

35:29.585 --> 35:30.628
Relax.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.713
I'll take good care of you.

35:33.339 --> 35:34.757
[chuckles]

35:35.383 --> 35:36.425
[sighs]

35:36.551 --> 35:38.427
Uh, I went down there once, but...

35:39.220 --> 35:42.098
I-- I saw somebody I thought I recognized.

35:43.599 --> 35:45.017
A casting director.

35:45.101 --> 35:48.271
So I pretended like I was
in the wrong place and-- and walked out.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.276
I'm gonna be an actor, see? So...

35:54.277 --> 35:56.529
I-- I can't have anybody thinking I'm...

35:57.655 --> 35:58.614
that way.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.242
[Archie] I'm lucky I'm not trying to be
in front of the camera.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.494
That just wouldn't work
for somebody like me.

36:04.871 --> 36:07.123
-That's why I'm a writer.
-A writer? You don't say.

36:07.206 --> 36:10.877
Yeah. Well, I got a studio looking
at one of my scripts.

36:11.460 --> 36:15.173
It could be a first, you know?
Major studio, black writer.

36:15.256 --> 36:18.426
I mean, there's only been
two or three black screenwriters before,

36:18.509 --> 36:22.138
Oscar Micheaux, Langston Hughes,
but those were race pictures, you know?

36:22.597 --> 36:24.140
Stories about black folk.

36:24.932 --> 36:28.394
It's like you can't even run
those pictures in parts of this country.

36:29.353 --> 36:32.565
But, you see,
my script’s about a white gal, so...

36:34.692 --> 36:37.320
Who knows?
Maybe you could star in it, Roy.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.738
[scoffs]

36:39.280 --> 36:41.199
Could you imagine something like that?

36:41.824 --> 36:43.451
-That would be--
-A dream.

36:44.160 --> 36:44.994
Yeah.

36:45.494 --> 36:46.370
Yeah.

36:49.749 --> 36:50.875
In Dreamland.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.169
[scoffs]

36:53.502 --> 36:54.712
And if it comes true?

36:56.130 --> 36:57.506
When it comes...

36:58.466 --> 36:59.508
true.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.055
We'd look back and say
the two of us meeting was

37:04.388 --> 37:06.515
that Hollywood dream
starting to come true.

37:35.753 --> 37:37.004
There you go, Jack.

37:37.463 --> 37:41.008
Buffalo Billy, Slippery Sammy,
Rabid Ronny,

37:41.092 --> 37:44.220
Goody Two-Shoes Glen, and Arch...
Welcome to the family.

37:44.303 --> 37:45.429
[chuckles]

37:45.513 --> 37:47.390
[coughing]

37:47.473 --> 37:48.933
Ernie, what's the matter? You all right?

37:49.016 --> 37:50.476
[clears throat]
It's nothing. It's nothing.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.436
This black walnut
blooms this time of year.

37:53.896 --> 37:55.648
Let's make it another great week, fellas!

37:55.731 --> 37:57.483
-[workers] Yes, sir!
-Go get 'em. All right.

37:57.566 --> 37:58.567
[worker] Great.

37:59.527 --> 38:00.403
[bell dings]

38:00.486 --> 38:02.029
-What'll it be?
-Dreamland.

38:03.614 --> 38:04.949
-Where to?
-Dreamland.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.409
-Where to for you?
-Dreamland.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.121
[bell dinging]

38:13.249 --> 38:15.251
[moaning]

38:16.877 --> 38:17.920
[bell dings]

38:18.129 --> 38:19.505
[moaning]

38:20.548 --> 38:21.424
[grunting]

38:23.676 --> 38:26.595
Hmm, you are really good at that,
you know?

38:27.096 --> 38:29.098
[chuckles]

38:29.640 --> 38:31.892
So is this what you do, full time?

38:31.976 --> 38:33.686
No, uh, just to make ends meet.

38:36.105 --> 38:37.064
I'm an actor.

38:37.982 --> 38:38.858
Really?

38:40.192 --> 38:41.235
I'm in casting.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.992
[indistinct chatter]

38:49.285 --> 38:50.703
[Jack] Excuse me, sorry.

38:51.829 --> 38:52.747
Pardon me.

38:53.873 --> 38:54.957
[whistles]

38:55.166 --> 38:59.462
Jack! I ain't seen you in a while, Bubby!
I thought you threw in the towel.

38:59.545 --> 39:01.839
-No, still pounding the pavement.
-Sure, sure. That's great.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.092
Me? I've been working every day this week
on a Sidney Lanfield picture.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.261
-Lot of frame wipes. Know what that is?
-Sure.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.722
I walk right next to the camera,
real close,

39:09.805 --> 39:12.141
and the director uses that
to cut the scene together.

39:12.224 --> 39:15.144
Practically editing this goddamn thing.
Shh, shh, here she comes!

39:18.564 --> 39:19.398
Okay.

39:19.815 --> 39:22.360
-I need three warm bodies.
-[crowd clamoring]

39:22.693 --> 39:26.572
You, you and... you.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.991
That's it. See the rest of youse tomorrow.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.409
[Lou sighs]

39:30.493 --> 39:32.203
Wanna grab a bite to eat? My treat.

39:32.328 --> 39:34.246
[Jack] No, I think I'm gonna stick around.

39:34.330 --> 39:35.790
What are you talking about?

39:35.956 --> 39:36.791
Jack?

39:40.127 --> 39:41.087
Get in here.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.048
What the hell's going on?

39:44.131 --> 39:47.593
Oh, I, uh, I got a walk-on role
in a Cecil B. DeMille picture.

39:47.676 --> 39:48.677
Might get a line!

39:48.761 --> 39:51.514
Hey, something's gonna happen
for you one of these days, Lou, I know it!

39:51.722 --> 39:52.640
How are you?

39:54.475 --> 39:56.352
[exhales] I love this town.

40:11.534 --> 40:12.868
[lock clicks]

40:15.121 --> 40:16.330
Hello, sweetheart.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.165
What are you doing?

40:18.707 --> 40:20.960
Nothing, just cooking dinner for my wife.

40:22.503 --> 40:23.337
Hungry?

40:23.838 --> 40:25.673
No, suspicious.

40:26.549 --> 40:27.800
What did you do?

40:27.883 --> 40:30.344
Uh, nothing, nothing.
Just come here. Sit down.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.138
We're celebrating.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.431
Celebrating what?

40:33.848 --> 40:35.307
You quitting your job.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.936
-What? I like working at Schwab's!
-I can't have you on your feet all day.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.731
You're three months along, I don't want
you working anymore, all right?

40:43.274 --> 40:44.608
Not another word about it.

40:47.069 --> 40:47.903
Let's eat.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.114
Just eat!

40:53.701 --> 40:54.994
[clears throat]

40:55.161 --> 40:55.995
Oh...

40:56.996 --> 40:57.872
my...

40:57.955 --> 41:00.249
-God.
-That's $500.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.417
How-- How did you get this?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.210
I've been doing good work
at the gas station.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.296
Rent's already paid, gas and electric too.

41:05.379 --> 41:07.173
Now, that ain't for spending, all right?

41:07.673 --> 41:10.009
That's a down-payment... on a house.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.138
Oh, my God. I-- I don't...

41:14.847 --> 41:16.599
I thought that's what you wanted.

41:16.807 --> 41:19.685
[laughing] It is, I just can't believe it!

41:19.768 --> 41:21.103
Oh, my God!

41:21.562 --> 41:23.981
Thank you! Thank you.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.734
Anything for you. Anything for my family.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.530
<i>What does that mean,</i>
<i>"sexually ambidextrous"?</i>

41:31.614 --> 41:37.244
That means that my man Stan here
likes the cat and the kitty.

41:37.912 --> 41:39.413
Huh, no fooling?

41:39.955 --> 41:41.040
Well, welcome aboard, Stan.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.374
-[bell dings]
-Thanks.

41:43.918 --> 41:44.919
All yours, Jack.

41:49.256 --> 41:50.799
-Fill 'er up?
-Dreamland.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.055
-Hello.
-How are you?

41:56.222 --> 41:58.307
-Better now, thank you.
-Glad to hear it.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.517
[bell dings]

42:14.823 --> 42:18.452
Oh, no, uh, I don't touch the money.
You pay Ernie and Ernie pays me.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.371
Well, what about a tip?

42:23.040 --> 42:25.417
Well, you can give it to me after,
if you're satisfied.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.962
Well, wouldn't this ensure
that I'm satisfied?

42:31.840 --> 42:32.675
Okay, thanks.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.928
-You're under arrest.
-What?

42:36.011 --> 42:36.845
Got him!

42:36.929 --> 42:39.056
Wait a minute, what is it?
Whoa, buddy, buddy, what is this?

42:39.139 --> 42:40.766
-Wait a minute, wait!
-[officer] Shut up!

42:43.602 --> 42:46.564
You're under arrest for solicitation
and lewd conduct

42:46.647 --> 42:50.109
pursuant to California Penal Code,
section 647-B.

42:50.192 --> 42:51.527
[sirens wailing]

42:54.905 --> 42:57.491
[big band music playing]
