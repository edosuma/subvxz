WEBVTT

00:37.370 --> 00:39.827
Hands where I can see 'em.
Don't turn around.

00:44.790 --> 00:46.576
I don't know you, but I saw your vehicle.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.628
Gives me a pretty good idea
what you're capable of.

00:51.670 --> 00:55.003
You don't know me, either.
And you're not going to.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.546
But that little meaningful click

00:59.390 --> 01:02.598
should give you an idea of exactly
what I'm capable of.

01:03.430 --> 01:04.886
So, toss me your keys.

01:12.690 --> 01:13.736
Here you go.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.111
Not tossing shit.

01:19.490 --> 01:20.525
Fine.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.370
That was my dinner.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.176
That wasn't an accident.

01:39.050 --> 01:42.929
I've lost everything.
I got nothing else to lose.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.476
You think you've been through a lot?

01:46.980 --> 01:49.221
Lady, you got no idea.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.193
The bleeding has stopped for now,
but the bullet; I have to get it out.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.409
The infirmary's got clotting pads,
gauze, antiseptic, forceps.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.117
Everything I need.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.492
Hey, kid, you know
how to use one of these?

02:47.580 --> 02:49.821
Can you get us any closer, Al?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.160
Yeah, I can try.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.990
Keep rolling. Get everything,
no matter what happens.

02:55.090 --> 02:56.455
Maybe this isn't the time.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.791
One day, someone’s gonna want
to know what happened here.

02:58.880 --> 03:01.587
Someone’s gonna care why
this went down the way it did.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.552
- These aren't the keys.
- I know.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.267
If you were gonna shoot me,
you would have done it already.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.432
Oh, I hope you're right about that.

03:11.350 --> 03:13.227
You can just tell me where to look.

03:13.310 --> 03:17.189
'Cause the sooner I get 'em, the sooner
you can start lookin' for a new ride.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.111
You know how many times
I've been zip-tied?

03:28.450 --> 03:29.860
Don't--

03:31.750 --> 03:33.570
Then tell me where the keys are.

03:33.670 --> 03:36.628
That‘s not how this works. You want
something, you got to gIve me something.

03:44.510 --> 03:48.094
- What are these?
- Told you. Not how this works.

03:49.390 --> 03:52.974
I'm sorry, but there are
people out there who need me,

03:53.060 --> 03:55.938
and this truck's gonna make
finding them a hell of a lot easier.

03:56.020 --> 03:57.430
You're looking for someone?

03:59.360 --> 04:02.352
They're interviews,
people I've come across.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.560
I move around a lot,
so, whoever you're looking for,

04:05.660 --> 04:06.900
maybe I've talked to them.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.287
Or know someone who has.

04:11.660 --> 04:12.991
Cut me loose.

04:13.870 --> 04:15.451
We can talk about a deal.

04:20.130 --> 04:23.429
Your keys. And the tapes.

04:25.590 --> 04:27.421
I tried to do this the nice way.

04:28.010 --> 04:29.216
Remember that.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.270
Shit.

05:03.010 --> 05:04.375
We can ’t get much closer.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.507
They’ll get jammed up /'n the wheel wells,
and we won’t be able to get them out.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.807
- Let's clear the path.
- Won't stay open long.

05:19.190 --> 05:21.317
I only have enough ammo
for one go at this.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.856
Then I'll be fast.

05:25.650 --> 05:28.778
All right. Get in the far back.
Watch out for the casings.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.280
This is gonna be loud.

05:31.370 --> 05:33.076
Morgan, don't go out there.

05:33.620 --> 05:35.702
- I got you into all this--
- No!

05:35.790 --> 05:37.576
You got me out of something.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.587
And now I'm getting you out of this.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.331
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.086
- I know where the infirmary is.
- No.

05:43.170 --> 05:45.081
I know what he needs.
Tell me how he's doing.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.376
He gets worse, I'll walk you through it.

05:46.470 --> 05:47.710
You don't have to.

05:48.510 --> 05:50.842
I do. I'll be right back.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.806
Don't make me come looking for you.

05:59.310 --> 06:00.607
- Okay.
- After you.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.740
Go! Hurry!

06:26.010 --> 06:27.125
What the hell was that?

06:27.220 --> 06:28.790
Morgan, Naomi, you copy?

06:31.680 --> 06:34.638
Morgan! Morgan, are you there?

06:35.180 --> 06:37.228
Hey, we're good in here.
You good out there?

06:37.390 --> 06:38.516
Al!

06:46.940 --> 06:49.238
We ’re all r/ght;
but you need to hurry.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.730
They’re here.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.111
They found us.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.278
We’d hole up in the water tower
in the middle of town,

07:03.380 --> 07:04.836
when things went south.

07:07.510 --> 07:09.080
And your wife?

07:17.060 --> 07:20.552
Come on, Nick, Alicia, please.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.601
Ever since we ran away
from the stumblers.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.776
It’s what Molly and I are calling them.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.741
No!

08:00.890 --> 08:02.437
Hi. Remember me?

08:16.450 --> 08:18.691
Everything better be there,
and it better be working.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.690
- It is.
- Good.

08:21.790 --> 08:25.669
'Cause you're gonna tell me your story.
Starting with who you're looking for.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.467
They're here to help the cowboy!
Gotta be going for the infirmary.

08:41.600 --> 08:43.261
Hey, Al.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.859
You want to come with us? See how
th/s ends? You can br/ng your camera.

08:47.150 --> 08:49.061
This is not gonna go your way.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.976
Right, but I know how much ammo you have.

08:51.070 --> 08:53.356
I've been in that van.
It's not gonna last forever.

08:54.490 --> 08:56.526
What happened?
I thought you just wanted a story.

08:56.990 --> 09:00.949
I got layers, Alicia.
Thought [’0' mix it up today.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.820
- You okay?
- Yeah.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.670
Okay. Almost there.

09:28.310 --> 09:29.766
We can get to the infirmary
through the service corridor!

09:30.320 --> 09:32.106
I got a better idea!

09:33.280 --> 09:34.565
Al!

09:36.700 --> 09:37.849
It's John.

09:39.700 --> 09:40.940
John?

09:47.080 --> 09:48.536
He’s bleeding again.

09:49.210 --> 09:53.544
There's gauze in my pack.
Just keep applying pressure. Come on.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.210
He can ’t lose any more blood.

10:03.180 --> 10:06.263
Charlie... Charlie...

10:07.270 --> 10:10.307
- Don't try to talk right now.
- It's for her.

10:12.770 --> 10:14.476
It's not gonna end like this.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.607
It's okay. It's okay.

10:25.200 --> 10:30.206
Hey. I used up my nine lives

10:30.750 --> 10:32.490
a long time ago.

10:33.710 --> 10:37.464
If I don ’t make it that’s okay with me.

10:38.510 --> 10:40.250
As long as you do.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.289
You hear me?

10:42.970 --> 10:44.767
And when this is all over,

10:46.100 --> 10:50.184
stop running from people. All right?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.221
And Morgan,

10:55.190 --> 10:57.021
you help him do the same.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.776
Or not do it. I mean...

11:04.120 --> 11:05.985
I think you know what] mean.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.991
We got it. Heading back your way now.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.200
Great Hurry back.

11:18.050 --> 11:20.712
Told you.
I knew it wouldn't end like this.

11:23.510 --> 11:24.590
Al, what was that?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.186
Al, do you copy?

11:30.270 --> 11:31.976
How’d you hire that RPG?

11:32.060 --> 11:33.391
Nice try, bitch.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.147
You're up against ballistic steel armour.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.313
Stitch-welded plates.
Shielding layer on shielding layer.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.904
This thing's built like a tank in a tank,
in a bank vault.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.667
You want to help me with this door?

12:03.970 --> 12:06.177
This 7/ be quicker if you talk.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.016
Otherwise,

12:12.020 --> 12:13.590
I got gobs of time.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.892
You always put guns to people's heads
to get what you want?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.560
If that's what it takes.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.236
That makes it okay?

12:28.740 --> 12:30.651
You haven't lost anyone
you care about yet?

12:33.710 --> 12:34.916
You lost someone you care about?

12:37.540 --> 12:38.837
Who was it?

12:40.670 --> 12:43.719
Husband? Boyfriend? Girlfriend?

12:45.930 --> 12:49.468
Sister? Brother? Kids?

12:56.860 --> 12:59.681
- What happened to your kids?
- I didn't say anything about kids.

12:59.780 --> 13:00.974
Didn't have to.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.731
Somebody do something to them?

13:06.320 --> 13:08.197
Or did they do something to you?

13:08.740 --> 13:12.324
Hurt you? Run away, maybe?

13:12.410 --> 13:15.868
Why does that matter?
Why does any of it matter?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.086
'Cause it's the truth.

13:22.300 --> 13:23.460
Facts.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.630
Reality.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.841
Just admitting that...

13:33.770 --> 13:36.728
That there is one reality,
and that you and I share it.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.897
That we're...

13:42.570 --> 13:45.528
We're connected by this single,
screwed-up world.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.519
That's the truth.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.957
And that can change things.

13:56.540 --> 13:57.746
How?

14:06.590 --> 14:08.330
I've been doing this a long time.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.465
Since before things went bad.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.184
Well, they were always bad, but
before they got a hell of a lot worse.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.272
I was in this little village
on the other side of the world.

14:28.740 --> 14:33.359
And there was this warlord,
thought he owned the place.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.031
Called himself "Twisted Round".

14:38.420 --> 14:42.083
He kept shaking people down
for food, water,

14:42.710 --> 14:45.292
things they didn't have enough of
to start with.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.177
No one on the outside gave a shit and...

14:50.680 --> 14:53.217
nobody in the village
could talk about it 'cause

14:54.760 --> 14:56.216
they were too scared.

14:57.770 --> 15:02.309
Till I talked one into talking about it.

15:05.030 --> 15:08.397
In the end,
they didn't need the peacekeepers.

15:09.150 --> 15:11.527
They didn't need guns or air support,
because the truth was

15:11.620 --> 15:14.271
that Twisted Round didn't have the army
he said he did.

15:14.870 --> 15:16.997
He didn't have the guns.
He didn't have shit.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.036
And suddenly,
the villagers weren't so afraid.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.588
They started standing up
to him and his boys.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.298
Twisted Round didn't last
too much longer after that.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.253
The only thing he had going for him was,
the truth wasn't coming out.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.999
Until it did.

15:38.930 --> 15:40.261
Look, I know

15:42.150 --> 15:44.766
I don't have the story you're looking for,

15:47.650 --> 15:50.392
but someone might be
interested in yours one day.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.491
Tell me what happened to your kids.

16:02.420 --> 16:05.378
I made them a promise about
a place where they'd be safe.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.331
I wasn't able to keep it.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.419
Don't hurt her.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.881
Why not? She hurt me.

16:22.310 --> 16:25.108
Al, we ’re on the other side
of the wall. 00 you copy?

16:27.980 --> 16:31.313
Pick it up. Tell her to come outside.

16:31.860 --> 16:35.978
Tell her it's safe. Or she dies.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.941
- Don't do this.
- She killed my brother.

16:40.580 --> 16:43.242
I'll do it. Pick it up.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.426
It's safe. You can come out.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.156
Mind ifI grab my camera?
Grab some footage?

17:23.250 --> 17:26.879
Don't move. You picked a side, Al.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.201
Oh, I'm definitely on their side.

17:30.420 --> 17:31.580
If you would've let me get close,

17:31.670 --> 17:33.206
I would've definitely
punched you in the cooch.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.832
Save it. It'll all be over soon.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.842
Come on, Alicia.
No one has to die here.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.846
Yeah. She does.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.640
Can you see her?

17:52.360 --> 17:53.395
Alicia!

17:53.490 --> 17:54.639
They’re not coming.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.286
What did you promise your kids?

18:09.380 --> 18:13.293
You don't have to give me details, names.
Just the truth.

18:14.550 --> 18:17.007
I promised them we’o’ find a place to live.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.341
What kind of place?

18:22.680 --> 18:24.671
Something that wasn ’1' just walls.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.129
We had those.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.181
In LA.

18:29.810 --> 18:31.357
In Mexico.

18:32.190 --> 18:35.819
Across the border.
A bunch of places in between.

18:35.900 --> 18:39.734
What I was looking for was different

18:40.990 --> 18:42.400
How?

18:49.920 --> 18:53.287
I was looking for a place where my kids
wouldn't have to do

18:54.420 --> 18:56.297
what I did to you today.

18:59.630 --> 19:01.211
Did you find it?

19:02.430 --> 19:04.091
I thoughtI did.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.346
What happened?

19:31.290 --> 19:32.370
Hurry!

19:32.460 --> 19:33.495
He needs you.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.497
- I'm going.
- No, no. No, no, no.

19:36.590 --> 19:39.252
There's no way you'd make it,
and then you'll both be gone.

19:39.340 --> 19:40.580
- Give me that.
- No, Morgan--

19:40.680 --> 19:42.386
They do not want to kill me.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.308
You have to tell them what I need to do
for John to keep him going.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.340
Yeah.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.087
Where'd you get these?

20:18.670 --> 20:20.718
- What?
- Where did you get these?

20:22.550 --> 20:26.589
A semi on Route 40 in Oklahoma.
Used to have a bunch of them.

20:27.890 --> 20:28.959
- Why?
- Wait, wait, wait.

20:29.060 --> 20:32.552
- What did you do with them?
- I traded 'em for an interview.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.429
What?

20:37.860 --> 20:39.066
Get back.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.526
Hey!

20:48.830 --> 20:50.115
You knew her?

20:52.870 --> 20:54.030
VVho?

20:54.750 --> 20:56.627
What happened there doesn ’t matter.

20:57.630 --> 20:58.870
What does?

20:59.880 --> 21:02.872
The fact that what I ’m looking for
m/ght not be poss/b/e.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.170
Why not?

21:14.310 --> 21:17.108
There are certain things you always
remember about your kids.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.271
No matter how old they get.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.230
No matter how much things change.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.769
You don't need a camera,

21:31.410 --> 21:32.991
'cause it just sticks.

21:37.710 --> 21:40.702
We were renting this house
in the mountains one summer.

21:44.420 --> 21:47.173
Had these big windows
overlooking the lake.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.427
One morning,
a bird flew right into one of 'em.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.261
Messed up its wing.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.141
May have been worse off inside.

22:01.270 --> 22:03.397
7'hey named it W/lhemina.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.389
’Amina ” for short.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.446
They kept her in a shoe box.

22:10.370 --> 22:11.940
qursed her back to health.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.789
Took turns at night setting their alarm,
so they could get up and check on her.

22:21.170 --> 22:25.049
Dug up bugs and worms to feed it...

22:26.840 --> 22:29.138
And ga I/e it water from an eyedropper.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.506
It went on for weeks.

22:32.930 --> 22:35.512
That damn bird just seemed
to get worse and worse.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.937
But they tried to feed it.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.647
They gave it water, anyway.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.891
My son was such a sensitive little boy.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.078
My daughter just decided
that bird was gonna live.

22:54.580 --> 22:58.402
Every morning, I got up
just dreading what I was gonna find.

23:02.290 --> 23:06.124
And then, one day, as I walked
down the hallway, I heard something.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.080
Chirping.

23:12.550 --> 23:15.007
Amina was flying around the living room.

23:19.810 --> 23:24.099
She lived because
my kids didn ’t give up on her.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.488
They gave her a chance
when no one else would

23:34.910 --> 23:37.117
There ’s not a whole lot of that
left any more.

23:40.370 --> 23:41.780
No, there's not.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.838
Thatis why I need to find a place
where things wﬂl be different

23:48.210 --> 23:50.428
Because that’s 507/ in my kids.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.172
But that l/ght; it’s getting fainter
every day we ’re out here.

23:59.520 --> 24:01.090
AndIcan’t...

24:06.690 --> 24:09.318
I can ’t imagine that part of them dying.

24:10.610 --> 24:13.352
I 7/ do whatever it takes
to keep it alive.

24:31.010 --> 24:32.875
She never told me your name.

24:36.550 --> 24:37.881
The stadium.

24:39.970 --> 24:42.188
This was the place she was looking for?

25:12.130 --> 25:13.927
I'm just trying to help my friend.

25:16.930 --> 25:18.886
You can after you step aside.

25:23.640 --> 25:24.880
Morgan.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.271
- I'm sorry.
- You already said that.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.271
- You don't understand.
- No, I do.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.447
My mom's dead

25:37.700 --> 25:39.156
because of what you did.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.912
Man, you've been doing
this for a long time.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.219
- Stop.
- Thinking this is who you are...

25:54.630 --> 25:57.679
What you got to do,
that there isn't any other way--

25:57.970 --> 26:00.598
- I said stop.
- Let me save John.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.729
- You can do whatever you want after that.
- No.

26:05.770 --> 26:08.261
No. You don't get to save him.

26:08.560 --> 26:10.721
You don't get anything.

26:11.690 --> 26:13.772
This is not who you are.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.850
You brought me here.

26:17.860 --> 26:20.488
- You helped me.
- I'm not that person any more!

26:20.580 --> 26:21.899
But you can be.

26:22.410 --> 26:24.651
You just have to decide
that you want to be.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.496
Get out of my way.

26:33.090 --> 26:34.500
You'd die for her?

26:37.840 --> 26:39.637
You'd die for her?

26:40.470 --> 26:41.676
Well, I tried to get away.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.347
From people,
from everything and everybody.

26:44.430 --> 26:46.091
Because I thought I had to.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.477
And somebody told me that I would end up

26:50.560 --> 26:52.892
with people again,
but I didn't believe him.

26:53.770 --> 26:55.431
I didn't want to believe him.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.350
So I ran

26:59.450 --> 27:02.362
halfway across the country
to prove him wrong.

27:03.620 --> 27:06.532
- I'm gonna do it. I have to.
- Here I am.

27:06.620 --> 27:08.656
Standing between your gun
and somebody I just met.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.088
- Morgan.
- Things can change.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.713
It did for me, and they can for you.

27:23.350 --> 27:27.263
- They can't. They can't--
- They have. They have.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.222
'Cause, look at it, I'm not dead.

27:35.650 --> 27:37.277
I stepped aside for your brother.

27:39.650 --> 27:42.232
I will not step aside for you,

27:42.320 --> 27:44.368
and whatever you think you've lost.

27:45.950 --> 27:49.863
Whatever your mother wanted for you,
it is still in you.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.990
And I see it.

28:09.310 --> 28:11.437
Go get John. Here.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.020
It's okay.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.236
Come on.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.661
Okay. Deal's a deal.

28:42.510 --> 28:45.388
So, where you heading?
Where do you think your kids might be?

28:45.890 --> 28:47.380
No details, right?

28:47.760 --> 28:49.921
Just want to figure out
how far you're going.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.169
Why?

28:51.770 --> 28:55.149
So I know how much food to give you.
You like kimchi?

28:58.440 --> 29:00.738
We got separated a couple weeks back,

29:00.820 --> 29:03.141
trying to clear a big spot
outside El Paso.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.271
Thought we could live there.
Too many dead inside.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.479
My kids escaped.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.616
I barely got out after 'em.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.126
Never found each other since.

29:17.670 --> 29:21.049
What do I owe you?
Said nothing's for free.

29:21.460 --> 29:22.711
Consider it a down payment.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.678
Tell me the rest when you find them.

29:27.930 --> 29:32.674
I move around a lot,
so, maybe we meet again.

29:35.100 --> 29:38.308
No tripwires. No guns.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.816
Mom?

30:35.330 --> 30:36.706
How'd you find us?

30:36.790 --> 30:39.372
Been to every motel
between here and El Paso.

30:39.460 --> 30:41.337
Figured you had to be at one of them.

30:43.750 --> 30:45.706
- How is he?
- Better now that you're here.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.677
Hello, hello, you care to tell us where
you hit the MSG jackpot?

30:51.390 --> 30:53.551
Ran into someone on the road,
who helped me out.

30:54.640 --> 30:56.881
Food's not the only thing
I found out there.

31:24.420 --> 31:25.876
There. That's it.

31:29.380 --> 31:31.382
Here? A baseball stadium?

31:33.930 --> 31:36.307
Isn't it a little big for us?

31:36.720 --> 31:38.517
It's not just for us, Victor.

31:39.350 --> 31:42.057
I'm thinkin' that's why we haven't found
a place that's worked yet.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.799
We were thinking too small.

31:44.650 --> 31:46.390
I don't understand.

31:46.480 --> 31:49.483
You want to bring other people in?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.446
Someone helped me when she didn't have to.

31:58.660 --> 32:00.708
I think it's time for us to do the same.

32:23.900 --> 32:27.358
I don't get it, Al.
Why didn't Madison tell us about you?

32:36.240 --> 32:39.403
I don't think she was exactly proud
of the way we met.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.456
You mind telling me what happened to her?

32:49.590 --> 32:51.660
You want the rest of my mom's story.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.385
Pull over.

33:24.210 --> 33:26.496
It's okay, John.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.245
You're gonna be okay.

33:33.670 --> 33:35.217
Thank you, Naomi.

33:39.300 --> 33:42.975
June. My name is June.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.299
What?

33:45.390 --> 33:47.858
I didn't tell them my real name
when they found me.

33:50.440 --> 33:51.850
Now you know.

33:52.530 --> 33:56.409
June? Why...

33:58.740 --> 34:00.071
Why, that's my favourite month.

34:18.930 --> 34:20.295
Tell me about that night.

34:22.010 --> 34:23.386
Tell me what she did.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.187
Tell me what you remember.

34:31.020 --> 34:35.104
My brother and I,
we were in the parking lot with Mel.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.979
We were surrounded.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.661
We weren’t gonna leave them out there.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.377
We fought as hard as we could.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.186
7'hey cleared a path for us.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.856
We just had to get to the stadium.

35:13.360 --> 35:14.975
But that was easier said than done.

35:19.200 --> 35:22.237
Madison told everyone to stay inside
before we left.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.368
She told them it was safe in there.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.077
It was safe in there.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.787
She said the walls would hold.

35:29.120 --> 35:34.080
But they didn ’t believe her.
They didn ’t have the. . .

35:35.340 --> 35:38.753
Same faith that she had in that place.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.717
I don ’t think anyone did.

35:42.800 --> 35:44.756
Not when they saw
what they were up against.

36:06.030 --> 36:10.455
Before we got back to the gate,
they opened it.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.121
They decided to run.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.962
Madison tried to stop them.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.841
We cou/dn ’t get back to the stadium.

36:30.640 --> 36:32.380
We didn ’t have a car to escape in.

36:32.480 --> 36:33.686
Mel took it.

36:36.940 --> 36:38.066
He didn ’t run away.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.984
He found me in the parking lot.
They were closing in on me.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.070
He saved me.

36:54.250 --> 36:58.698
What happened to everyone in the cars?
The people that were trying to get away?

36:59.550 --> 37:00.915
They didn't.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.887
All the people my mom found

37:09.010 --> 37:10.887
all the people she’d brought in,

37:12.140 --> 37:13.596
they were gonna die.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.646
I tried to talk them out of it.

37:23.490 --> 37:24.650
I did.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.237
I believed the walls could hold.

37:28.030 --> 37:29.577
Because Madison did.

37:31.910 --> 37:33.901
But I cou/dn ’t change their mind.

37:34.290 --> 37:38.124
When they left; I went back
to get supplies. I didn ’t want to leave.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.490
But I knew they were headed for trouble.

37:40.590 --> 37:42.455
And when I got back,

37:44.380 --> 37:45.836
it was too late.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.809
7'he caravan was overrun.
The dead came at me.

37:53.350 --> 37:55.682
And I ran unt/lI cou/dn ’t run any more.

37:58.190 --> 38:02.069
You still ran. You still joined them.

38:03.320 --> 38:06.141
And we didn't see you in the caravan.

38:07.070 --> 38:09.061
We thought you were still inside.

38:10.950 --> 38:12.486
We thought you died.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.866
I thought you died.

38:17.250 --> 38:20.742
All of you. When they
found me by the side of the road,

38:22.210 --> 38:24.587
I didn ’t think there
was anywhere else to go.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.131
You did what you thought you had to do.

38:31.970 --> 38:34.131
None of us could get out
of the parking lot.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.761
We cou/dn ’t get back to the stadium.

38:43.150 --> 38:44.731
There were too many dead.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.448
We had to clear a path.

38:47.530 --> 38:50.112
So that’s what we did

38:50.200 --> 38:54.899
But Madison, she had another idea.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.062
And when I realised
what she was trying to do,

39:31.070 --> 39:32.617
I tried to go back.

39:33.620 --> 39:36.441
But there were too many
of the dead between her and Madison.

39:42.130 --> 39:44.246
He kept me from running alter them.

39:47.550 --> 39:48.710
He saved my life.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.438
We’d reinforced the walls
to keep the dead out.

40:06.860 --> 40:09.488
So she knew they were strong enough
to keep them in.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.236
7'hey followed her inside.

40:15.700 --> 40:17.406
More than we could count.

40:26.040 --> 40:30.659
She led the dead inside,
so they could get away.

40:32.470 --> 40:34.335
...so we could get away.

40:40.100 --> 40:43.558
She tried to go through
the tunnels to double back to the gate.

40:44.810 --> 40:47.608
But there were 5177/ too many
outside the gates for her to escape.

40:49.860 --> 40:51.487
So she locked herself in.

41:17.550 --> 41:18.881
Mom?

41:20.930 --> 41:22.090
Mom?

41:38.120 --> 41:42.363
I was afraid to lose this place
because I thought you needed it...

41:44.040 --> 41:46.201
7'0 stay who you are r/ght now.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.756
But you know it...

41:55.720 --> 41:57.676
No one's gone until they're gone.

42:50.020 --> 42:52.181
It was never about the stadium.

42:56.030 --> 42:57.736
It was about the people.

43:03.580 --> 43:04.899
It was about us.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.422
Thatis why
my mom gave up her life.

43:22.050 --> 43:23.551
So they could live.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.050
So we could live.

43:27.600 --> 43:29.090
So I could live.

44:13.360 --> 44:17.524
King Saul fell on his sword
When it all went wrong

44:17.780 --> 44:21.898
And Joseph is brothers sold him
Down the river for a song

44:21.990 --> 44:26.029
And Sonny Liston rubbed some
77ger Balm into his glove

44:26.120 --> 44:31.319
Some things you do for money
And some you do for love, love, love

44:47.930 --> 44:49.886
Rasko/n/ko v felt sick

44:49.970 --> 44:52.097
But he cou/dn ’t say why

44:52.190 --> 44:56.183
When he saw his face reflected
In his victim’s twinkling eye

44:56.270 --> 45:00.525
Some things you ’ll do for money
And some you ’ll do for fun

45:00.610 --> 45:05.695
But the things you do for love are
Gonna come back to you one by one
