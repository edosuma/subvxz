01:25.419 --> 01:27.911
The last day of school
is the best day of the year.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.457
Oh, Benny.

01:29.464 --> 01:32.548
I'll miss my teachers,
especially Mrs. Warner.

01:32.551 --> 01:35.589
Yeah, school's fun,
but summer is funner.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.428
More fun, Benny.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.797
That's what I said.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.391
I wonder what Grandfather
has planned for us.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.386
He promised to tell us
a surprise today, remember?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.979
I can't believe it's been
a whole year

01:46.982 --> 01:48.473
since we came to live with him.

01:50.861 --> 01:52.022
Race ya!

01:52.613 --> 01:53.899
Oh, no you don't!

01:58.285 --> 01:59.446
Let's go.

02:18.764 --> 02:22.758
Hmm.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.681
- Where are they, boy?
- Hi, Watch.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.553
- Whoo.
- Hey, boy.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.644
Tell us, Grandfather.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.518
You promised, remember?

02:33.528 --> 02:35.440
Did I?

02:38.492 --> 02:39.983
Watch wants to know too.

02:41.453 --> 02:44.321
Oh!

02:45.082 --> 02:47.369
It's summer vacation,
and we all want to know.

02:47.376 --> 02:50.244
Mm-hm. School's out already?

02:50.253 --> 02:51.585
That can't be right.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.205
But school is out,
right, Jessie?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.298
He's joking, Benny.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.301
Joking?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.882
I mean everything I say.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.926
Now, come and sit down
and I'll tell you the surprise.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.185
Did you know that our family
has an island?

03:07.896 --> 03:09.012
An island?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.433
It's just a little one.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.523
There's nothing on it
except a small farm

03:12.526 --> 03:13.937
and a fishing cottage.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.652
Old Captain Daniel
looks after it for me.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.817
How come you never told us
about it before now?

03:18.824 --> 03:21.237
I was saving it
for just this moment.

03:21.243 --> 03:23.860
I thought we'd go see it
this very afternoon.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.613
And if you like, you can
stay there for the summer,

03:26.623 --> 03:28.455
just as I did
when I was your age.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.366
- Oh.
- Is it far away?

03:30.377 --> 03:31.413
Not too far.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.752
Just a short drive
to Stonington.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.797
Then Captain Daniel
will take us over in the boat.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.167
Will we stay there by ourselves?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.840
No, the Captain lives
on the island in the summer.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.258
What will we do there?

03:43.265 --> 03:45.848
I used to like
exploring the island.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.935
You can go swimming and fishing
whenever you feel like it.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.553
Oh, I love fishing!

03:51.356 --> 03:52.767
Can Watch go too?

03:52.774 --> 03:55.391
Certainly. He would be lonesome
without you.

03:55.402 --> 03:56.483
Yay!

03:56.486 --> 03:57.943
Come on, let's get packing.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.948
We need dishes,
spoons, cups, bowls.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.275
We better make a list.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.286
Worms, Jessie.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.119
Don't forget worms.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.956
Don't worry,
we'll get plenty of worms.

04:21.219 --> 04:24.303
I'm going on a picnic,
and I'm bringing apples.

04:24.306 --> 04:28.300
I'm going on a picnic, and I'm
bringing apples and bananas.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.267
I'm going on a picnic

04:30.270 --> 04:33.058
and I'm bring apples and bananas

04:33.064 --> 04:34.646
and crayons.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.647
Crayons aren't food, Benny.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.737
Uh-huh. I saw a kid eat them
in school one time.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.210
Wow! Look at all the boats!

04:56.922 --> 05:00.131
And there's Dr. Moore.
We haven't seen him in ages.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.297
Yes. I thought he might like
to come along too.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.420
Is that a pirate
he's talking to?

05:05.430 --> 05:07.843
No, Benny.
That's Captain Daniel.

05:07.849 --> 05:08.849
Oh.

05:10.852 --> 05:12.013
Dr. Moore!

05:12.020 --> 05:13.101
Well, hello.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.811
- Hey!
- We missed you!

05:14.815 --> 05:17.398
It's been far too long.
How are you all?

05:17.400 --> 05:19.517
How was your school year?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.811
Good to see you, Captain.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.108
How's the channel today?

05:23.114 --> 05:25.197
It'll be a smooth trip, sir.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.533
Glad to hear it.
All aboard then.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.822
Yeah!

05:28.829 --> 05:29.990
Slow down.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.332
Commander Alden,
reporting for duty, sir!

05:42.342 --> 05:43.924
Aye aye, Commander.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.761
All right. Hold on, everyone.

06:24.426 --> 06:26.588
There it is!
Our very own island!

06:39.566 --> 06:41.683
Why are you waving, Benny?

06:41.693 --> 06:43.980
- There's nobody there.
- I'm saying hello to the island.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.249
Is that our little house?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.126
That is my house.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.053
You are staying up there.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.809
Follow me.
I'll show you the way.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.748
Are we going to live
in that yellow house then?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.833
Nope, not there either.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.451
But that just leaves...

07:43.213 --> 07:45.125
- Up there?
- Let's take a look

07:45.131 --> 07:46.918
before you decide
you don't like it.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.006
Come on, Benny.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.655
Oh, wow.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.865
My goodness.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.539
Hi there.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.209
Wee!

08:28.883 --> 08:31.091
We can sleep in here,
like ponies.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.960
Our own stove?

08:34.304 --> 08:36.046
- It looks new.
- Giddy-up!

08:36.057 --> 08:39.015
I guess someone's made a few
improvements around here.

08:40.311 --> 08:42.597
And when you need it,
there's fresh water

08:42.605 --> 08:44.517
from the pump
just by the windmill.

08:48.069 --> 08:51.733
It's cold as ice,
even on very hot days.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.449
A hayloft!

09:07.505 --> 09:09.041
What do you think, Henry?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.424
Should we stay here tonight?

09:12.427 --> 09:14.259
I think
that's a great idea, Jessie.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.551
So, does that mean you like it?

09:17.557 --> 09:18.798
We love it, Grandfather.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.344
This is such a great surprise.

09:23.521 --> 09:27.014
I believe there's still an old
swing behind the yellow house.

09:27.525 --> 09:30.563
If you swing high enough,
you can see the whole island.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.061
I wanna do that!

09:32.072 --> 09:33.188
Well, come on, then.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.406
And that's about
the shape of it.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.862
That's quite a story.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.283
But I think you've done
the right thing.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.660
Why so serious?

09:49.255 --> 09:50.496
Oh, well, I...

09:50.673 --> 09:53.791
I was just telling the doctor
about the young fella

09:53.802 --> 09:55.259
I hired to help me this summer.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.086
Who is he?

09:57.639 --> 10:00.052
He's from just over
on the mainland.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.015
I've known the family for years.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.176
Apparently, he hurt his arm.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.309
As long as I'm here, I should
probably go take a look.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.564
I think that's a good idea.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.813
Let's meet this young man.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.982
Oh! What about the swing?

10:15.448 --> 10:17.656
I can check on him just fine.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.945
You go have fun with Benny.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.028
- Come on, Grandfather.
- All right.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.121
We'll be at the swing,
if you need me.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.705
Thank you, Doctor.

10:29.921 --> 10:33.335
I don't like secrets, but
I don't know what else to do.

10:33.341 --> 10:37.836
Hmm. Something hidden
is always a burden.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.257
Maybe we can fix that.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.639
Hm?

10:51.025 --> 10:52.025
Hello.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.110
I'm Dr. Moore.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.572
Hello.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.732
Hmm.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.990
Captain Daniel thought maybe
it'd be a good idea

11:03.997 --> 11:05.488
if I had a look at your arm.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.619
Oh, it's okay.
Dr. Moore can help.

11:13.298 --> 11:17.167
- The Captain told me you fell.
- Yes.

11:17.510 --> 11:20.253
I hit my head pretty hard
and broke my left arm.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.638
How did it happen?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.474
I was exploring the pueblo
in New Mexico

11:25.476 --> 11:26.762
and fell from a cliff.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.147
May I?

11:31.232 --> 11:33.315
Hmm. Oh my.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.102
Well, you're lucky
it wasn't worse.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.361
I suppose you're right,
but I don't feel very lucky.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.699
Yeah.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.694
Well, it seems
to be healing nicely.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.495
And how about your head?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.619
For a few weeks
I couldn't remember much,

11:49.626 --> 11:51.618
but I'm feeling better now.

11:52.629 --> 11:56.714
Do you mind if I ask you a few
questions? Just to make sure.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.128
Okay.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.878
If you promise
that it will stay between us.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.589
Of course,
if that's what you really want.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.395
Yeah!

12:13.566 --> 12:16.400
I can see the whole world
out there!

12:17.654 --> 12:18.654
Wow!

12:23.368 --> 12:25.325
Mm Mm-hm.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.445
And I came here
to Captain Daniel

12:27.455 --> 12:29.037
as soon as I remembered
who I was.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.742
I'd like to take another look
at that arm in a couple weeks.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.620
Mm, come to my office
and we'll talk more then.

12:36.422 --> 12:37.833
- I will. Thanks.
- Ah.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.837
And thanks for keeping it
all under wraps.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.177
I guess we better decide what

12:43.388 --> 12:45.508
- the children should call you.
- Mm.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.557
They can call me Joe.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.389
It is my middle name,
after all.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.230
Yeah. All right then,
we'll call you Joe.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.618
What do you think, Doc?

13:08.621 --> 13:12.535
Well, you can't force someone
to see what they don't want to.

13:12.542 --> 13:13.953
It won't take.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.622
They have to come to it
themselves.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.209
I think being around those kids

13:19.215 --> 13:21.047
will be the best medicine
of all.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.050
Yeah.

13:27.056 --> 13:28.968
Henry, you're in charge.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.932
But if you need anything,

13:30.935 --> 13:33.302
Captain Daniel
has a phone in his cottage.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.305
Are you sure you won't be
lonesome, Grandfather?

13:36.107 --> 13:37.848
I'm sure I will,

13:37.859 --> 13:39.976
but I'll come to visit
as often as I can.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.780
You won't hear Watch bark
at the milkman for a long time.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.776
True. I shall miss all that
wonderful noise in the morning.

14:00.506 --> 14:01.747
Can I drive?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.465
In about ten years.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.463
Man overboard!

14:12.185 --> 14:13.847
Everything check out okay?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.429
Yes, it's fine,
just as the Captain said.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.145
He seems like a good young man.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.984
Goodbye now!

14:29.994 --> 14:31.781
- Bye!
- Bye, Grandfather!

14:31.788 --> 14:33.654
- Bye, Grandfather!
- Bye!

14:33.664 --> 14:35.656
Goodbye! And have fun!

14:36.376 --> 14:37.662
I'll see you all soon.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.540
- Goodbye!
- Bye, Grandfather!

14:40.546 --> 14:43.209
- Bye, Grandfather!
- Bye!

14:54.644 --> 14:55.760
Can we have supper now?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.012
I'm hungry.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.851
Of course.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.636
We can have supper as soon
as we make a table to eat it on.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.193
I can't wait that long.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.607
It's almost my bedtime.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.195
Not tonight, Benny.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.862
Tonight, you get to stay up
until it gets dark.

15:10.868 --> 15:11.949
How's that?

15:12.703 --> 15:13.739
Really?

15:27.176 --> 15:28.176
Let's get to work.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.716
After all that work,
I'm pretty hungry.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.128
Can't forget you, boy.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.250
You like that, don't you?

16:13.139 --> 16:14.721
The sea air
is making Watch hungry.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.676
I think I have sea air too.
Can I have another piece?

16:19.687 --> 16:20.973
All you want, Benny.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.232
Thanks, Jessie.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.128
What are we looking for?

16:47.590 --> 16:50.298
The spring,
that Grandfather told us about.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.501
The brook should lead us
right to it.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.552
Look, honeysuckle.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.028
Mmm.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.286
Yummy.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.159
Look! A magic barrel!

17:29.882 --> 17:31.123
It's not magic, Benny.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.674
The windmill pumps the water
up into the barrel

17:33.678 --> 17:34.885
so we can use it.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.841
It sounds like...

17:39.058 --> 17:40.058
...magic to me.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.262
Oh my. I think maybe
you do have sea air after all.

17:44.272 --> 17:45.433
You guys get Benny to bed.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.188
I'll get the water.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.398
Thanks, Henry.

17:53.197 --> 17:54.358
Come on, little man.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.533
Can I have the stall
next to yours, Jessie?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.118
Of course, Benny.

18:09.755 --> 18:10.916
Socks.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.424
Socks.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.222
Socks.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.236
Sleep tight.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.428
How'd we miss this
last night, boy?

19:10.608 --> 19:11.608
Hello.

19:12.735 --> 19:14.897
Oh. Good morning.

19:15.613 --> 19:16.613
I'm Henry.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.481
I'm... Joe.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.117
I work for Captain Daniel.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.620
Hiya, boy.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.125
- How do you like your garden?
- Mine?

19:32.963 --> 19:34.545
- Is it mine?
- It is.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.335
I got it started for you
but it's up to you

19:36.342 --> 19:37.628
to take care of it now.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.135
Good morning.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.508
Hello, Joe.
You look just like Joe.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.310
And you look just like Benny.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.147
How did you know?

19:52.149 --> 19:54.311
Captain Daniel told me
all your names.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.184
I feel as if I knew you already.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.529
Well, I better get back to work.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.320
Oh, and if you need something,

20:03.327 --> 20:04.989
just write it down
on a piece of paper

20:04.995 --> 20:06.861
and it leave it in the box
on the dock.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.416
He seems nice.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.411
Mm. Watch likes him.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.413
Don't you, boy?

20:15.423 --> 20:16.789
He reminds me of someone.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.794
I just can't think who.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.006
He must've started this garden
in the spring.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.421
These peas are ready to eat.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.219
Avast yee landlubbers!

20:27.226 --> 20:28.387
Arrgh!

20:28.936 --> 20:30.723
You'll be the one
to walk the plank

20:30.730 --> 20:32.517
if you don't help us pick
the peas.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.944
I think we should
make a plan for the summer.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.231
Mornings we can work
in the garden when it's cool.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.918
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.467
Hey, how about
you give me a hand?

21:02.470 --> 21:04.302
Sure, Henry. What are we doing?

21:04.805 --> 21:06.512
Making a cupboard
to hold the dishes.

21:07.224 --> 21:08.556
You take this.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.432
I'll hold the nail.

21:14.648 --> 21:15.729
Wait! Wait!

21:17.401 --> 21:18.401
Huh?

21:20.070 --> 21:22.110
This way, you won't get
your thumb smashed.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.157
Good idea, Jessie.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.288
Ha! I did it!

21:36.420 --> 21:38.252
These look delicious, Jessie.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.799
- They're so sweet.
- And crunchy.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.633
Everything seems better
when we work for it ourselves.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.056
Mmm.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.258
What do you say we check out
the beach after lunch?

21:51.936 --> 21:54.599
Yeah! We can look for treasure.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.517
Great idea, Benny.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.824
It's so pretty here.

22:14.917 --> 22:15.953
Whoa.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.358
Look at that!

22:48.784 --> 22:49.900
Clams!

22:56.709 --> 22:57.709
Wee!

23:06.218 --> 23:07.709
I can't dig fast enough.

23:11.181 --> 23:15.221
Good boy, Watch! You can do
all my digging if you want.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.885
Hey.

23:17.688 --> 23:18.804
Come on.

23:46.717 --> 23:47.958
Let's keep exploring.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.965
The clams will keep like this
just fine.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.921
We can pick them up
on the way back.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.365
Hey, look!

24:12.952 --> 24:14.113
Out there!

24:15.663 --> 24:18.063
Grandfather must've
fixed this place for us to swim.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.952
Let's check it out.

24:30.135 --> 24:31.135
Ah!

24:31.595 --> 24:33.928
Cold! I like warm water.

24:33.931 --> 24:37.550
Hey, you'll get used to it,
once you go in all the way.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.300
Oh, Benny.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.849
You go ahead, Jessie.
I'll keep an eye on Benny.

24:42.439 --> 24:43.555
Thanks Violet.

24:53.283 --> 24:54.649
Stupid water.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.562
Whoo! Isn't this perfect, Henry?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.194
Paradise.

25:44.877 --> 25:45.877
Huh?

25:46.336 --> 25:47.497
How's the water today?

25:47.838 --> 25:49.045
Like melted ice.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.847
I see you found some rock weed.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.601
This?

26:03.437 --> 26:04.437
Look.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.517
See how different it is
when it's in the water?

26:13.947 --> 26:15.154
Oh, there it goes.

26:15.741 --> 26:16.822
We've lost it.

26:20.871 --> 26:22.078
There!

26:23.457 --> 26:24.538
I've got it!

26:25.042 --> 26:26.408
Look, Violet!

26:26.418 --> 26:27.704
What are you guys doing?

26:29.797 --> 26:30.878
Oh.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.461
It's beautiful, Benny.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.425
Violet, may I use
some of your paper?

26:37.221 --> 26:39.463
- Sure.
- Watch this.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.432
Benny, float the seaweed
in the water again.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.968
Seaweed has a natural glue in it

26:44.978 --> 26:46.344
that makes it stick
to the paper.

26:47.189 --> 26:50.478
When it dries, you can use
the paper for writing letters.

26:50.484 --> 26:51.691
Whoa.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.865
Look at this funny shell.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.280
I think I'll save it.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.903
Should we collect this too,
Jessie?

27:03.914 --> 27:06.372
Oh, it's lovely, Benny.

27:06.375 --> 27:09.163
Hey, what if we make
our own museum?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.832
That is a perfectly
wonderful idea.

27:12.381 --> 27:14.043
I'll make a list
of things to collect.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.542
Problem, how can I write
the names of these things

27:17.553 --> 27:19.340
when we don't know
what they're called?

27:20.305 --> 27:23.673
Tell you what, I'm going
to the mainland this afternoon.

27:23.684 --> 27:26.427
I could stop by the library
and ask the librarian

27:26.436 --> 27:28.018
if she knows any books
that might help.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.101
- Would you, Joe?
- I'd be glad to.

27:31.108 --> 27:33.350
Come on. Let's see what else
we can find for the museum.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.272
Whoa!

28:01.513 --> 28:02.845
Can someone open the door?

28:06.268 --> 28:07.349
Whoa.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.518
Oh, let me help.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.349
Perfect timing.
Supper is almost ready.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.601
- Can you stay?
- I...

28:16.612 --> 28:19.946
Good. Then we can look
at the books together after.

28:19.948 --> 28:20.984
Can I do anything?

28:21.533 --> 28:23.149
You're our first guest.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.152
But you'll have to wash
your own dishes.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.370
Oh, no he won't, Benny.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.785
You shouldn't say such things.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.874
Just sit, Joe.
I'll bring you some clams.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.629
How do you eat clams, anyway?

28:43.639 --> 28:46.097
Use your fork
to pull the clam out.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.970
Then, dip it into the butter.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.936
Oh! Oh! Like this, right?

29:00.405 --> 29:02.738
Mmm.
That was wonderful, Jessie.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.484
But I really do want to help
with the dishes.

29:05.494 --> 29:07.406
All right.
We'll get it done faster

29:07.412 --> 29:09.244
if we all do them together.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.080
Then we can look at the books.

29:36.817 --> 29:37.817
My flower!

29:38.485 --> 29:41.899
B-E-A-C-H

29:42.781 --> 29:44.647
P-E-A.

29:45.367 --> 29:46.699
It's a beach pea!

29:48.662 --> 29:49.948
Whoa.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.742
I'd like to find one of these.

29:53.875 --> 29:56.208
Did you know that you can tell
how old a sand dollar is

29:56.211 --> 29:57.372
by counting its rings?

30:00.257 --> 30:01.623
What is it, Henry?

30:01.633 --> 30:03.420
Oh, nothing.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.670
Just... how do you know
so much about this stuff?

30:06.680 --> 30:09.138
I supposed I just picked it up
here and there.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.883
Oh, I was having so much fun,

30:11.893 --> 30:13.429
I didn't realize
how late it was.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.978
Thanks again.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.892
This was really nice.

30:22.988 --> 30:23.988
Bye, Joe.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.238
Goodnight, Benny.

30:37.210 --> 30:38.746
I love looking at these books.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.667
They make me want to get started
on our museum.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.153
What is it, Henry?

31:10.160 --> 31:11.526
It's raining pretty hard.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.077
Hey, listen.

31:14.247 --> 31:15.863
The rain is coming in somewhere.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.875
Over there.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.409
We can't let the stove get wet.

31:23.465 --> 31:24.922
What's the matter, Jessie?

31:25.592 --> 31:27.754
It's okay, Benny.
You go back to sleep.

31:27.761 --> 31:31.220
I can't. Rain's coming
in my window and all over me.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.890
What's going on?

31:37.187 --> 31:38.803
Oh dear.

31:38.814 --> 31:40.021
You have to get up, Benny.

31:40.816 --> 31:42.682
I wanna go home.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.524
It's nice and dry there.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.570
Now Benny, don't be like that.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.154
You're a big boy now.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.904
Benny, you can sleep in my bed.

31:52.452 --> 31:54.569
I'll make sure
there are no more leaks.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.286
Looks like a perfect day
to work on our museum.

32:43.462 --> 32:47.126
A perfect day
for some warm clam chowder too.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.749
Oh, but I'll need some onions
from the garden,

32:49.759 --> 32:50.966
and it's pouring out.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.470
I'll get them.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.346
I better do it now
before this rain gets any worse.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.639
Hmm. My clothes
are gonna get soaked.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.642
I have an idea.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.436
Why don't you put on
your swimsuit?

33:06.943 --> 33:08.980
Brilliant.
What would we do without you?

33:47.567 --> 33:48.603
Delivery.

34:10.840 --> 34:11.840
Mmm.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.196
It seems a shame to press
these beautiful flowers.

34:39.786 --> 34:42.949
In the winter, the flowers
outside will be gone,

34:42.956 --> 34:45.664
while these
will stay beautiful forever.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.139
It's already noon.
I think the chowder's ready.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.890
- This smells amazing.
- Mmm!

35:10.442 --> 35:11.558
Mmm.

35:11.568 --> 35:12.684
Mmm.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.982
I don't mind the rain at all.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.053
I think your birds

35:45.060 --> 35:46.972
are the best thing
in the museum, Henry.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.099
The rain has stopped.

35:55.362 --> 35:57.604
Let's explore to the very end
of the island today.

36:20.261 --> 36:21.718
A mountain!

36:21.721 --> 36:23.178
Whoa!

36:23.181 --> 36:25.218
A mountain of clam shells.

36:26.309 --> 36:27.349
They're all broke.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.510
Broken, Benny.

36:29.521 --> 36:30.978
Well, broken then.

36:31.981 --> 36:33.517
Old, broken clam shells.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.687
No pretty ones for our museum.

36:35.694 --> 36:39.233
It's as if somebody sat here
for years and years,

36:39.239 --> 36:40.855
getting out clams.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.231
Mysterious.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.821
Come on, let's keep going.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.444
We're almost at the end
of the island.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.190
I... I don't think
we can go any further.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.228
Look!

37:18.778 --> 37:20.144
A little cave!

37:29.164 --> 37:30.200
Benny?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.708
In here! Come on!

37:48.433 --> 37:50.470
It's like a little room.

37:50.477 --> 37:52.184
Listen. Echo!

38:03.406 --> 38:05.238
Watch thinks he found a clam.

38:05.241 --> 38:07.278
Let's see.
What do you have there, boy?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.121
Huh.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.417
Hmm.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.043
I think it's an old axe head.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.212
It's still sharp!

38:23.176 --> 38:24.212
Henry, look!

38:35.355 --> 38:37.472
The tide is coming in!
Let's get out of here!

38:42.695 --> 38:44.561
No one knows where we are.

38:44.572 --> 38:45.688
I'm scared.

38:45.698 --> 38:47.906
Don't talk, Benny.
Just keep going.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.407
A big wave is coming!

38:53.414 --> 38:55.747
When it comes,
we all have to dive under!

38:58.044 --> 39:00.161
Hold on tight and don't let go.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.860
Help! Henry!

39:26.447 --> 39:28.655
- Hang on, Benny!
- Benny!

39:30.869 --> 39:31.905
Henry!

39:49.721 --> 39:51.428
We're lucky we got out.

39:52.265 --> 39:54.097
We did get out.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.592
Thank good old Watch for that.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.207
Everything all right?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.130
Hm?

40:26.132 --> 40:28.169
No, we're scared,

40:28.176 --> 40:29.633
and almost dead.

40:30.720 --> 40:31.881
What do you mean?

40:32.388 --> 40:34.675
We crawled into a cave
and the tide came up

40:34.682 --> 40:35.889
and almost caught us.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.133
If Watch hadn't barked,

40:37.310 --> 40:38.892
I'm not so sure
we would've made it.

40:40.480 --> 40:43.518
Come on. Captain Daniel
made a pot of stew for lunch.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.774
That'll warm you up.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.689
Ah!
That sounds pretty good, Joe.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.057
We found something
in the cave

40:58.081 --> 40:59.663
but we're not sure what it is.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.952
This is an axe head.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.203
I thought it was,
but you seem to be sure.

41:05.213 --> 41:06.249
Where'd you find it?

41:06.798 --> 41:09.085
Just past that old pile of clam
shells at the tip of the island.

41:09.092 --> 41:11.584
There's a cave there.
Benny found it.

41:12.720 --> 41:13.756
Can you show me?

41:15.723 --> 41:17.840
Oh no. I'm sorry I found it.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.432
And I'm never going back.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.519
Don't worry, Benny. We'll be
all right if Joe is with us.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.308
Let's take a rest for a bit and
give the tide a chance to turn.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.230
Then, we'll go
have a look together.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.026
About here is where
we found the axe head.

41:37.704 --> 41:39.445
But the tide
has washed away the hole.

41:40.665 --> 41:43.157
We need to dig carefully
so we don't break anything

41:43.167 --> 41:44.328
we might find.

41:51.551 --> 41:52.792
Is this anything?

41:53.469 --> 41:54.676
Let's see.

41:55.763 --> 41:56.963
Here's another piece.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.266
It's a cooking bowl!

42:01.269 --> 42:02.635
How can you tell?

42:02.645 --> 42:04.181
By the way the pieces fit.

42:04.188 --> 42:05.349
It tells us a lot.

42:05.982 --> 42:08.349
I think my chicken bone
tells the most.

42:10.486 --> 42:13.194
That's too big
to be a chicken bone.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.358
Horse bone then.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.152
I think that's a human bone,
Benny.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.577
The sand is dry here.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.209
Which means the tide doesn't
normally reach this high.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.788
These bones must've been
uncovered in a big storm.

42:33.134 --> 42:36.798
Whatever happened here,
it happened a long time ago.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.046
Why do you want pictures?

42:39.974 --> 42:42.717
We need a record of everything
just as we found it.

42:44.479 --> 42:47.313
Every detail will teach us
something about the history

42:47.315 --> 42:48.647
of this island.

42:48.858 --> 42:51.566
We need to let the right people
know before we dig anymore.

42:52.028 --> 42:54.395
Aw, but we just found him, Joe.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.400
He's for our museum.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.738
I know, Benny,
but if word gets out about it,

42:59.744 --> 43:02.487
people from the mainland will
come here looking for souvenirs,

43:02.497 --> 43:03.777
and they would destroy the site.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.412
I think we better keep
everything a secret

43:07.919 --> 43:10.787
until we can tell
your grandfather, okay?

43:12.006 --> 43:13.338
Okay, Joe.

43:33.694 --> 43:37.358
Listen.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.627
It's coming from down
by the dock.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.712
Why thank you.

44:35.715 --> 44:36.751
You're too kind.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.048
Could I see it just a minute?

44:39.969 --> 44:40.969
Sure.

44:44.182 --> 44:47.266
Go ahead and try.

44:47.268 --> 44:49.601
Oh. I can't play it.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.684
You sure
you don't want to try?

44:52.690 --> 44:54.147
I can show you how.

44:54.150 --> 44:55.857
I have a feeling
you might be good at it.

44:56.986 --> 44:58.443
You play some more, Joe.

45:21.344 --> 45:23.631
I think the fish
are sleeping in this morning.

45:23.638 --> 45:24.879
I haven't caught a thing.

45:26.265 --> 45:28.678
Grandfather says
that just when you think

45:28.684 --> 45:30.016
you won't catch a fish,

45:30.728 --> 45:32.640
that's when you will catch one
for sure.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.097
Oh, it works!

45:35.942 --> 45:37.649
Hang on, Benny.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.268
I will!

45:44.158 --> 45:47.276
I did it! I caught a fish.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.778
You sure did, Benny!
It's Joe!

45:51.791 --> 45:53.498
Oh, I hope he got the groceries.

45:54.669 --> 45:55.876
Hi Joe!

45:58.089 --> 46:00.923
Joe, hey Joe, look at my fish!

46:00.925 --> 46:03.258
Wow, Benny! That's a whopper!

46:03.970 --> 46:05.757
I think this is everything
on your list.

46:06.472 --> 46:07.553
Thanks, Joe.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.802
And one more thing.

46:13.271 --> 46:14.637
Oh wow.

46:14.647 --> 46:15.933
Oh my.

46:19.694 --> 46:21.731
- Look at that!
- It's beautiful.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.404
I have time now,
if you'd like a lesson.

46:31.831 --> 46:33.072
I think I would, Joe.

46:33.249 --> 46:34.769
I'll go with you!

46:34.834 --> 46:36.666
No, you'd better keep fishing.

46:36.669 --> 46:37.955
We don't have enough
for dinner yet,

46:37.962 --> 46:40.375
- and you're our best fisherman.
- That's true.

46:40.381 --> 46:42.668
Here, you earned it.

46:42.967 --> 46:44.003
Thanks, Henry.

47:06.574 --> 47:09.487
Get up! Get up!
Grandfather's coming today!

47:09.493 --> 47:12.486
Huh?

47:12.496 --> 47:13.737
Hey, come here!

47:25.176 --> 47:28.214
We should make him something
special for lunch today.

47:28.220 --> 47:31.054
I bet he would like to eat
the same things we usually do.

47:31.974 --> 47:33.681
Maybe he and I
could go fishing.

47:34.143 --> 47:35.679
But we might not catch anything.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.848
Grandfather may not have time
for fishing.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.596
Let's have dinner
from our own garden.

47:39.607 --> 47:40.939
Oh, that's a better idea.

47:41.108 --> 47:43.395
At least we'll know for sure
we'll have something to eat.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.195
That must be him!

47:48.199 --> 47:51.317
Grandfather! Grandfather!
Here I am!

47:51.327 --> 47:53.114
I see you!

47:57.249 --> 47:59.832
I caught two fish
just the way you taught me!

47:59.835 --> 48:02.418
And they were real fish
and Jessie baked them

48:02.421 --> 48:04.538
and... and... and we ate them!

48:04.548 --> 48:05.834
Amazing!

48:06.425 --> 48:08.087
Grandfather!

48:13.599 --> 48:15.056
Hmm.

48:17.937 --> 48:18.937
Hmm.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.145
You've made this barn
look pretty good.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.610
I remember this old thing.

48:32.910 --> 48:34.367
Say, what's up there?

48:37.123 --> 48:38.739
Can I take a look?

48:38.749 --> 48:42.163
Of course.
But it is awfully hot up there.

48:42.169 --> 48:43.376
I don't mind.

48:50.886 --> 48:51.886
Ah.

48:55.433 --> 48:58.050
We used to call these
mermaids' tears.

49:03.399 --> 49:04.435
Hmm.

49:05.067 --> 49:07.810
Did anyone tell you
to make a museum like this?

49:07.820 --> 49:10.938
No. It was our idea.
Don't you like it?

49:10.948 --> 49:12.940
I like it very much.

49:12.950 --> 49:15.909
I did the very same thing
when I was your age.

49:15.911 --> 49:17.573
I found a big bone,

49:17.580 --> 49:20.414
but Joe said
we can't put it in our museum.

49:20.416 --> 49:21.532
It's a secret.

49:21.542 --> 49:22.578
Really?

49:23.794 --> 49:25.080
Who's Joe?

49:25.087 --> 49:26.919
That man who works
for Captain Daniel.

49:26.922 --> 49:29.335
Well, I see.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.626
Let's go back downstairs.
We can sit down.

49:33.429 --> 49:35.546
I think that's a good idea.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.219
Joe says
it's a very old skeleton.

49:39.059 --> 49:41.392
If people find out,
they'll come over and ruin it.

49:42.104 --> 49:43.515
A skeleton?

49:43.522 --> 49:44.979
We found it in a cave,

49:44.982 --> 49:47.395
near a big pile of shells
at the end of the island.

49:48.027 --> 49:49.063
Ah.

49:49.904 --> 49:53.488
I remember that pile of shells
from when I was a boy.

49:53.491 --> 49:55.027
Look, Grandfather.

49:56.035 --> 49:57.697
Joe says
they're from olden days.

49:59.371 --> 50:00.487
Hmm.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.577
That Joe seems to know a lot.

50:04.752 --> 50:06.368
I have something to show you
too.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.461
Now, what is this?

50:13.844 --> 50:16.177
I'm afraid I'm a bit
out of practice.

50:17.097 --> 50:19.635
It's so much fun
to see all this.

50:19.642 --> 50:21.554
I'd like to show you
the best thing.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.846
What's that?

50:22.853 --> 50:24.810
I'd like to show you Joe.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.226
I think he went over
to the mainland this morning.

50:27.233 --> 50:28.314
That's funny.

50:28.734 --> 50:30.851
Because he certainly knew
Grandfather was coming today.

50:30.861 --> 50:33.069
That makes me cross.

50:33.072 --> 50:34.529
I want you to see Joe.

50:34.532 --> 50:36.899
He's my best friend
in all the world.

50:36.909 --> 50:38.525
Then I'm cross too.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.780
<i>Please pass the carrots.</i>

50:43.791 --> 50:46.704
<i>You've done
a wonderful job with the garden.</i>

50:46.710 --> 50:48.622
<i>Everything is so delicious.</i>

50:49.296 --> 50:51.413
I shall come
to this restaurant again.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.796
Please do. But you're not
going home already, I hope.

50:55.803 --> 50:57.669
I wish I didn't have to.

50:57.680 --> 51:00.172
It's so much more fun
being here with you.

51:00.182 --> 51:01.218
Oh.

51:01.517 --> 51:04.601
But before I go, I have
something for each of you.

51:04.603 --> 51:07.266
Where's that bag I had
when I came in?

51:07.273 --> 51:08.514
Here it is.

51:08.524 --> 51:09.935
Ah, thanks, Benny.

51:10.484 --> 51:13.147
Just a few things I thought
might come in handy.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.522
These should be useful
when you're exploring.

51:16.532 --> 51:17.989
Whoa. Wow.

51:18.576 --> 51:19.612
Hey, thanks.

51:19.952 --> 51:22.695
I was hoping you would make
some beautiful paintings

51:22.705 --> 51:24.071
of the island for me.

51:24.623 --> 51:26.956
Oh. I will.

51:27.418 --> 51:30.286
And these,
for the chef in the family.

51:32.339 --> 51:33.375
Hmm.

51:34.300 --> 51:35.300
Ah-hah.

51:36.135 --> 51:37.501
Here you are, Benny.

51:39.597 --> 51:40.713
Wow!

51:42.349 --> 51:44.762
Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

51:44.768 --> 51:47.476
Look, I'm Captain Daniel,
driving the boat.

51:50.858 --> 51:52.724
I wish
you didn't need to leave.

52:24.266 --> 52:25.552
Hmm.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.892
I sure wish Joe
could've met Grandfather.

52:28.562 --> 52:31.396
- Me too, Benny.
- I'm sure they'll meet sometime.

52:32.024 --> 52:33.390
What are you making, Jess?

52:33.400 --> 52:34.811
An apple pie.

52:35.736 --> 52:38.228
But I have to use this bottle
as a rolling pin.

52:38.238 --> 52:39.649
I hope it turns out.

52:55.089 --> 52:56.089
I'll get it.

53:00.469 --> 53:03.086
I'm sorry.
Uh, I don't mean to bother you.

53:03.097 --> 53:04.929
Please, come in, won't you?

53:05.432 --> 53:08.470
I went to the cottage
by the dock but nobody was home.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.599
Then I saw the smoke
from the chimney up here.

53:12.731 --> 53:14.142
Oh.

53:15.109 --> 53:18.193
Forgive me.
I should introduce myself.

53:19.321 --> 53:20.732
My name is Lonan Browning.

53:21.657 --> 53:22.657
I'm Henry.

53:23.575 --> 53:24.782
Nice to meet you, sir.

53:25.494 --> 53:27.156
I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

53:28.122 --> 53:30.830
He's been missing,
and I am worried about him.

53:30.833 --> 53:34.167
I heard that he might be staying
on the Alden island.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.502
This is the Alden island,
isn't it?

53:36.505 --> 53:38.497
It is, but I'm afraid
you've come over

53:38.507 --> 53:39.873
for nothing, Mr. Browning.

53:39.883 --> 53:42.045
There's nobody on the island
but us,

53:42.052 --> 53:43.714
Captain Daniel and Joe.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.553
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.089
I thought I finally found him.

53:48.100 --> 53:50.057
I guess I'll just have
to keep looking.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.769
Wait,
as long as you're here,

53:52.771 --> 53:56.060
why don't you stay and help us
eat our first apple pie.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.650
It does smell awfully good.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.274
Well, come on then.

54:09.079 --> 54:10.615
Oh, it looks delicious.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.870
Hey, guests first, Mr. Watch.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.087
Thank you.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.418
Mmm. It is delicious.

54:25.888 --> 54:29.052
Did you know Joe is my best
friend in all the world?

54:30.434 --> 54:33.893
All but Jessie, and maybe Watch
and Captain Daniel,

54:33.896 --> 54:35.603
and of course, Violet and Henry,

54:35.606 --> 54:37.017
and my grandfather.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.731
You have a lot of best friends.

54:40.235 --> 54:41.476
Joe plays the violin.

54:42.029 --> 54:43.270
Is that so?

54:43.280 --> 54:45.772
He also knows about seaweed
and shells

54:45.783 --> 54:46.990
and arrowheads.

54:48.243 --> 54:49.529
Hmm.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.072
Your Joe knows a lot.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.238
Do you know where he is?

54:54.750 --> 54:57.208
He's probably out on the boat,
helping Captain Daniel.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.418
Why?

54:58.587 --> 55:01.250
Well, my friend knows a lot
about arrowheads too.

55:02.216 --> 55:05.630
I have a feeling
maybe your friend and my friend

55:05.636 --> 55:07.127
are the same after all.

55:07.137 --> 55:08.137
Oh.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.392
Can you give Joe this card
when you see him next?

55:11.016 --> 55:14.350
It has my number, so he can
call me if he wants to.

55:19.983 --> 55:21.190
Thank you all again.

55:21.777 --> 55:25.191
You were so kind to share
such a wonderful pie.

55:25.197 --> 55:27.189
- Mmm.
- Goodbye.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.583
Morning, Benny.

55:47.469 --> 55:48.550
Morning, Joe.

55:51.765 --> 55:54.599
Do hermit crabs and starfish
and jellies go to heaven?

55:55.310 --> 55:56.846
Uh...

55:56.854 --> 55:58.516
I wouldn't know, Ben.

55:59.606 --> 56:01.313
Answer really, Joe.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.313
I suppose there ought to be
enough room

56:04.319 --> 56:05.651
for all creatures in heaven,

56:06.572 --> 56:08.529
as long as people
don't have the final say.

56:12.452 --> 56:15.661
Grandfather let me invite a
friend over to the island today.

56:15.664 --> 56:16.905
That was nice of him.

56:16.915 --> 56:19.578
Yep. Captain Daniel
is getting them now.

56:20.127 --> 56:23.541
Can you help us build a fire
so we can roast marshmallows?

56:23.547 --> 56:25.914
I'd be glad to.
Let's go gather some wood.

56:39.605 --> 56:42.222
Oh, here they come!

56:42.232 --> 56:43.768
Meet you at the beach!

56:50.073 --> 56:51.109
Mike!

56:54.453 --> 56:55.614
Hey, big Ben!

57:00.542 --> 57:02.750
Watch and Spotty are friends.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.790
Spotty's a lot bigger than Watch

57:04.796 --> 57:06.708
and stronger too.

57:06.715 --> 57:10.208
Watch may be small
but he is fast.

57:10.218 --> 57:11.218
Mmm.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.378
Let's race the dogs
and find out.

57:13.388 --> 57:14.629
Good idea!

57:15.557 --> 57:17.048
Ready...

57:17.059 --> 57:19.176
set... go!

57:20.896 --> 57:23.388
Find Joe, Watch! Find Joe!

57:35.535 --> 57:36.992
Well, hello there, Watch...

57:38.080 --> 57:39.412
and friend.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.998
Those boys are quite a pair.

57:44.544 --> 57:46.126
Spotty got there first.

57:46.129 --> 57:47.245
He did not.

57:47.255 --> 57:49.042
He didn't even know the way.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.837
Benny, don't start
the picnic fighting.

57:51.843 --> 57:54.130
You started this fight, Benny.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.003
I did not start it!

57:56.014 --> 57:57.471
Yes, you did too!

57:57.474 --> 57:58.715
You two stop fighting,

57:58.892 --> 58:00.303
or we'll end the picnic
right now

58:00.310 --> 58:01.642
and send Mike home.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.602
That's not fair!

58:03.605 --> 58:04.846
Ow!

58:04.856 --> 58:06.813
You see what happens
when you get mad?

58:08.276 --> 58:10.518
You've kicked a broken shell
and cut your big toe.

58:11.196 --> 58:13.859
Benny, get me
the first aid kit, please.

58:13.865 --> 58:14.855
Okay, Henry.

58:14.866 --> 58:16.027
Let me fix it.

58:19.371 --> 58:22.079
That ought to hold you,
but you should take it easy

58:22.082 --> 58:23.448
on that foot for a while.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.415
Ah, looks all right to me.

58:25.419 --> 58:28.583
Come on, Mike, let's explore.

58:28.588 --> 58:30.454
Help! Help!

58:33.969 --> 58:36.552
Somebody's fallen in!
Keep your eyes on him!

58:42.436 --> 58:43.972
Help!

58:56.700 --> 58:58.157
Come back, Joe.

59:06.168 --> 59:07.168
Joe's got him.

59:08.587 --> 59:12.422
I think it's Pat.

59:12.424 --> 59:13.460
Who's Pat?

59:13.467 --> 59:15.800
He's my brother.

59:15.802 --> 59:17.509
He's 11 years old.

59:18.138 --> 59:19.720
He knew I was coming here today.

59:20.849 --> 59:22.129
Do you know
who the other boy is?

59:22.726 --> 59:24.262
Maybe Johnny.

59:24.269 --> 59:27.182
He knew about
a row boat he could get.

59:27.189 --> 59:28.771
But he doesn't know
how to use it.

59:30.275 --> 59:32.813
It's not his.
They just took it.

59:32.819 --> 59:34.355
You mean they stole it?

59:45.415 --> 59:47.077
Pat!

59:49.544 --> 59:50.910
He'll be all right.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.503
Just a little wet and scared.

59:53.215 --> 59:55.377
Let's get him over by the fire
to warm up.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.389
You were lucky
Joe is such a good swimmer.

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:08.728
We won't ever
take a boat again.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.522
No, I don't believe
you will either.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.523
Here, Pat,
this will warm you up.

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.692
I'll say. It's on fire!

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.408
Hang on, everyone.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:27.075
Bye, Benny!

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:33.995
What are you crying about,
Benny?

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.088
I wouldn't cry at nothing.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:39.004
Who's crying? Not me!

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.048
Spotty can run faster
than Watch.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.464
Don't listen to him.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.136
He's nothing but trouble,
anyway.

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:48.844
I wish he would come over
every day.

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.016
No!

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:55.517
I think we can get along without
any company at all for a while.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.814
You don't call
Joe company, do you?

01:00:57.821 --> 01:01:00.404
Oh, no.
He's just one of the family.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.162
Did I do something wrong?

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:11.248
No, the wind just shifted on us.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:15.332
We can't control the wind,
but we can adjust the sails.

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.964
When I say so,
you pull the tiller.

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.128
Okay.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:23.593
Now!

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.641
Hang on!

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.011
Wow!

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.187
This is so much fun!

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.770
Joe, I was thinking,

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.740
do you think I could be
an explorer when I get older?

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.911
What I mean is, can a person
go to faraway places

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.372
and discover old bones
and things for a job?

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:53.074
I've heard of it.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.628
Hey, I know
an old explorer's trick.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.582
First, you find the Big Dipper.

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:03.755
Then, find the two stars

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.345
that form the outer edge
of the Dipper's cup.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:09.091
There and there.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.391
If you imagine a line straight
through those two stars,

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:17.390
it would point to the brightest
star in the Little Dipper,

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:19.559
right at the end of its handle.

01:02:20.362 --> 01:02:21.569
That's Polaris,

01:02:22.948 --> 01:02:23.984
the North Star.

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:27.992
It always points to true north.

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:30.111
Know the secret
of finding the North Star,

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.913
and you will know how
to find your way home,

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:34.703
even in the darkest of nights.

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:56.095
You two
have been busy this morning.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.226
Watch did most of the work.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.476
Good boy, Watch.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:03.603
Did you forget
what day it is today?

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.024
No.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:06.192
Yes.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:07.485
Maybe.

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:08.903
What day is it, Henry?

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:13.241
Who forgets their own birthday?

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:15.581
I did forget.

01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.792
Now that you remember,
what do you want for a present?

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.878
- Cream!
- Do you mean ice cream?

01:03:21.881 --> 01:03:25.249
No, I mean cream in a bottle,
like milk.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.343
A big bottle, not a little one.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:29.086
That's a strange
kind of a present.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:31.013
You want to drink it?

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:35.055
No, I want to put it on some
blackberries, like Peter Rabbit.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:37.849
Well, okay then.

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:40.143
One big bottle of cream it is.

01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:42.684
Happy birthday, Benny.

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:45.482
Hi Joe! It's my birthday!

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:47.775
Yes, I know. Violet told me.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.239
How about a birthday concert?

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:51.491
Will you play too, Violet?

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.281
Yes. If you'd like me to.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.326
What a great present!
Can we hear it now?

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:03.630
Ready?

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.832
- Beautiful, Violet.
- Wonderful.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:47.457
I could listen all day.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:49.426
John!

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:52.511
Mr. Browning?

01:04:52.514 --> 01:04:55.723
I am so glad
I've finally found you.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.430
His name is Joe, not John.

01:04:58.978 --> 01:05:01.265
I should know,
he's my best friend.

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:04.106
Yes, I think you told me
when I was here before.

01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:07.400
But he was my friend
before he was yours.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:09.441
He could have two best friends.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:10.608
Well, that's fair.

01:05:11.533 --> 01:05:14.241
Do you mind if I talk with
our best friend for a moment?

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.201
I guess that's okay.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.160
Are you all right, John?

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.251
You just disappeared
after the accident.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.292
Accident? What accident?

01:05:27.298 --> 01:05:28.298
Well...

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.338
I was working for Mr. Browning's
museum in New Mexico.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.217
One day, I was exploring
in the mountains,

01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.557
when the rocks gave way.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.634
- Whoa!
- Oh, wow.

01:05:40.645 --> 01:05:43.854
I fell and banged my head
pretty good.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.974
It was quite a goose egg.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:46.984
Oh my.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:49.435
I couldn't remember much
for a few weeks.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:52.359
This island was one of the first
things to come back to me.

01:05:52.365 --> 01:05:54.573
I thought it might be
a quiet place to get better

01:05:54.576 --> 01:05:55.783
and think things through.

01:05:57.495 --> 01:05:59.111
I'm sorry that I let you down.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:01.038
Oh, nonsense.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:03.035
You didn't let anyone down.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:06.919
And as soon as you're ready,
I want you to come back to work.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.332
I'm glad to hear you say it,

01:06:08.339 --> 01:06:10.126
but I need to talk
to my uncle first,

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.632
if he'll see me, that is.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:15.837
See you? He's worn himself out
worrying about you.

01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:18.631
I feel awful
about not telling him sooner.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.932
He'll be even more angry
when he finds out

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.052
I've been here the whole time
without letting him know.

01:06:23.062 --> 01:06:25.600
How did you know
about this island?

01:06:25.607 --> 01:06:27.690
Yeah, and who's your uncle?

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.183
He sounds scary.

01:06:29.194 --> 01:06:31.902
You don't know
who John is, do you?

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.771
I think I should be the one
to tell them.

01:06:33.781 --> 01:06:34.781
Joe is my middle name.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:39.243
My full name
is John Joseph Alden.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.077
I'm your cousin.

01:06:41.498 --> 01:06:42.579
What?

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:43.823
Our cousin?

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.620
- What?
- Is it true?

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:49.086
Yeah. My father and
your grandfather were brothers.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:52.126
That's it!
That's who you remind me of.

01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:55.501
Grandfather in those old
pictures in the photo album,

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:56.719
you look a lot like him.

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:59.509
Yeah, we are alike,
in more ways than one.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:03.468
We're both stubborn
and we did not always get along.

01:07:03.478 --> 01:07:05.561
When I wanted to go work
for Mr. Browning,

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:07.020
he wanted me to stay.

01:07:08.066 --> 01:07:10.558
But I got mad
and went anyway.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.770
I got mad and ran away once too.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.488
You ran away to the boxcar
in Grandfather's backyard,

01:07:16.491 --> 01:07:18.733
and that was only
until you got hungry.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:20.279
It still counts.

01:07:20.286 --> 01:07:24.405
I was so mad, but now
I don't even remember why.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:27.328
Well, running away
didn't solve my problem.

01:07:27.335 --> 01:07:30.749
And it took a hard knock on
the head to learn that lesson.

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:33.998
And now, I think I'd like
to come back home to live.

01:07:34.842 --> 01:07:37.960
That is,
if my cousins don't mind.

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:41.089
Mind? It's the best thing
we could think of.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:43.341
Somebody better call Grandfather
right away.

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:46.765
He's coming over today,
for Benny's birthday.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.182
We can tell him together.

01:07:48.189 --> 01:07:51.023
Hold on a second.
I think we have to be careful.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:53.813
He thinks he lost you.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.188
News like this could come
as a shock for a man his age.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.860
Well, what can we do?

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:00.778
He'll know me
as soon as he sees me.

01:08:00.785 --> 01:08:03.994
I think I have a way to tell him
so it's not so sudden.

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:07.118
But you'll have to stay
out of sight at first.

01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:09.082
Okay, let's try it.

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:11.668
We need to hurry.
Grandfather will be here soon.

01:08:19.595 --> 01:08:22.087
Grandfather! Grandfather!

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:25.432
- Oop. Be careful.
- Grandfather!

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.352
Happy birthday, my boy.

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:34.566
Are your veins all right,
Grandfather?

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:36.689
Huh? Veins?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.901
Yes. You know, some people
have funny veins,

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.533
so when they hear something
awfully good,

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:44.743
suddenly,
they just drop down dead!

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:45.953
Hmm.

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:49.240
I am sure that good news
wouldn't kill me.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.457
Good,
because I've got a surprise.

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:54.374
Oh, here, Benny, carry this.
It's your birthday lunch.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.087
What? Oh! Got it!

01:08:58.091 --> 01:09:00.960
Uh-oh.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.839
I suppose Benny is right
about getting a shock,

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:05.930
isn't he, Grandfather?

01:09:06.725 --> 01:09:08.388
Maybe for some people.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:11.511
But if I had good news,
I wouldn't want to miss the fun.

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:13.639
That's good.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:17.231
Now, think of the nicest
surprise you can.

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.228
What would that be?

01:09:19.822 --> 01:09:22.439
I suppose
it wouldn't be a thing.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:23.903
It would be a person.

01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.325
You can't drop dead
because you promised.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.082
What exactly is this good news?

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.291
Come on, Grandfather.
Joe is so worried.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:40.131
Joe? Hmm.

01:09:44.805 --> 01:09:46.341
Why are you waving?

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.886
Huh?

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.023
John?

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.144
Is it really you?

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:01.103
It's really me, Uncle James.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:04.732
When Mr. Browning came to me
and told me what happened...

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.985
I was so worried.

01:10:07.995 --> 01:10:09.281
Whoo!

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.207
I'd almost given up hope.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:18.579
I'm so sorry.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:21.999
Doesn't make sense.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:25.385
Why come all this way
and not see me?

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.263
I wanted to, and I almost did,

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.428
but I was afraid.

01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:34.098
Why on Earth would you be afraid
to come home?

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:37.189
The way we fought,
I wasn't sure you'd have me.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:41.022
And honestly, I wasn't sure
I really wanted to come back.

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:45.364
But then, I got to know
my cousins.

01:10:46.576 --> 01:10:49.444
Being around them helped me
to see things more clearly.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:51.821
They have that effect on people.

01:10:52.915 --> 01:10:55.908
I'd like to make it right,
if it's not too late.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:02.044
You can't just cut off a whole
year like a tangled fishing line

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.256
and throw it away.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:07.799
- Hmm.
- Can we eat yet?

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:11.423
What a good idea, Benny.

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.092
Come on, Grandfather,

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:14.934
let's celebrate
Benny's birthday.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.644
Yes, of course.

01:11:27.909 --> 01:11:29.866
A toy Watch is on my cake?

01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:32.031
Here you go, Benny.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:35.747
No thank you. I just want
blackberries and cream.

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.992
Just like Peter Rabbit.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.994
Only Peter Rabbit
didn't get any.

01:11:40.505 --> 01:11:42.667
Don't you remember?
He was naughty.

01:11:45.384 --> 01:11:49.219
At last, Peter Rabbit
has his blackberries and cream.

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.347
I got two surprises
for my birthday:

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:54.387
a bottle of cream
and a new cousin.

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:59.017
Come to the house and we'll try
to sort everything out.

01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.565
Thank you, Uncle James.

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:03.645
I would like that
more than anything.

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:21.832
I've never seen a summer
go so fast.

01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:25.172
I feel like we just got here.

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.042
I'll miss this place.
I don't want summer to be over.

01:12:30.972 --> 01:12:34.181
Whoa, my! Does he do that often?

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.799
No, not often.

01:12:37.395 --> 01:12:38.886
He is getting over it.

01:12:39.814 --> 01:12:41.476
Someday, he'll grow up.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.814
Stop crying.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:44.979
Listen, Benny,
don't you remember?

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:46.648
Joe will be going back too.

01:12:46.654 --> 01:12:49.613
- Don't scare him away again.
- Oh yeah!

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.695
I can't wait
to show you our boxcar!

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.445
I'd like that,
but nothing's for sure yet.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.662
I still need to work things out
with your grandfather.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.209
This island
was sure full of surprises.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.504
Surprise Island.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.751
That's a perfect name
for this place, Jessie.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.548
But I never did find
any treasure on this island.

01:13:12.555 --> 01:13:14.296
No? I did.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.475
Well, I guess that's it.

01:13:31.032 --> 01:13:32.398
I am not going to cry.

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.034
Good for you, Benny.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.402
Just keep thinking how lonesome
Grandfather's been.

01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.825
Yes, and I wanna go home now.

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.948
I wanna sleep in my real bed.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.701
A real bed
sounds good to me too.

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.169
Goodbye, barn.

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.132
See you next summer.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.776
Where's Joe?

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.071
He said he'd be back
to say goodbye.

01:14:18.079 --> 01:14:19.195
Did he run away again?

01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.414
Grandfather
would surely want him to stay.

01:14:24.085 --> 01:14:26.202
Joe! Joe!

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.496
Joe! Joe!

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:33.254
Oh, I shouldn't worry too much.

01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.468
Besides, we have to go now
or we'll be late

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.133
meeting your grandfather.

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.782
Thanks for everything, Captain.

01:15:02.289 --> 01:15:06.033
Now, I expect you all to come
back to the island again,

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.409
very soon.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.581
We will.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.295
Good.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.968
We got eight lobsters!

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:22.762
And the Captain made us
lobster rolls!

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:26.186
And I got to bait the trap!

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:27.349
We have a stop to make,

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:28.972
and you can tell me
all about it.

01:15:35.906 --> 01:15:37.943
Should we ask about Joe?

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:41.193
I think he'd tell us
if there was something to tell.

01:15:47.793 --> 01:15:50.331
Ah, here we are.

01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.464
Hey.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:58.173
My goodness. Is that
named for you, Grandfather?

01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.216
It's named for our family.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.673
It's been here a long time.

01:16:10.357 --> 01:16:13.225
Hello, Mr. Alden.
It's nice to see you again.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:15.853
Is the new director about?

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:17.900
He's on his way, sir.

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:26.623
Joe!

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.662
You're the director
of the museum?

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.955
Yeah. It was Uncle James' idea.

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:34.747
Does this mean
you won't go exploring anymore?

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.876
No, in fact, I'll be leading the
exploration on Surprise Island.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:41.378
And from time to time,
I'll go on other expeditions.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:44.131
But the rest of the time,
I'll be here.

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:48.302
We worked things out
because that's what families do.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:51.145
You don't look like Joe anymore.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:53.185
You look like John.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:54.941
Well, thank you, Benny.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:56.609
I think.

01:16:58.948 --> 01:17:01.656
Follow me. You're going to love
this exhibit.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:07.696
Did you collect
all these yourself, Grandfather?

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.706
- Wow! How neat!
- Wow!

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.962
Your birds are just like ours.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:18.832
So they are.

01:17:25.808 --> 01:17:26.808
<i>Jessie?</i>

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.188
Jessie?

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:36.395
Jessie?

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:39.944
Did you call me, Benny?

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.365
Yes.

01:17:43.492 --> 01:17:45.449
I said Joe
was gonna live with us.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.704
He's my best friend
in all the world.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:51.364
Yes, I know he is.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:56.415
I mean, all but you, Jessie,

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:59.456
and Violet and Grandfather.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:00.752
And Watch?

01:18:01.802 --> 01:18:04.465
Yes, Watch and Henry

01:18:04.471 --> 01:18:05.837
and Captain Daniel.
