WEBVTT

00:07.974 --> 00:09.142
- NEW YORK CITY
IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:09.175 --> 00:11.244
EXPENSIVE CITIES IN THE WORLD.

00:11.277 --> 00:13.713
- PEOPLE SPEND MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:13.747 --> 00:15.081
JUST TO LIVE IN THIS CITY.

00:15.115 --> 00:17.884
- AND BECAUSE SPACE
IS LIMITED,

00:17.917 --> 00:20.020
PROPERTY VALUES
ARE ASTRONOMICAL,

00:20.053 --> 00:22.722
AND THAT'S GREAT NEWS IF YOU'RE
IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.657
- YOU BETTER SELL THIS.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.926
- THERE'S SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS
ABOUT NEW YORK CITY REAL ESTATE.

00:26.960 --> 00:28.061
YOU KNOW,
IT'S UP IN THE SKY.

00:28.094 --> 00:29.963
YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:29.996 --> 00:32.065
OF REAL ESTATE, REALLY,
JUST STACKED UPON EACH OTHER.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.602
- THERE'S 20,000,
25,000 REAL ESTATE AGENTS

00:35.635 --> 00:39.739
ON ONE ISLAND, ALL COMPETING
FOR THE SAME BUSINESS.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.142
- I WANT 2.2. I DON'T WANT
YOU TO [bleep] THIS UP.

00:42.175 --> 00:45.578
- IF YOU DON'T DO YOUR JOB,
NEXT. IT'S OUT. YOU'RE OUT.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.685
16 MILLION. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
COME UP TO THAT POINT.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.286
IT'S A TOTAL HIGH
TO MAKE A DEAL.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.488
- IT'S--IT'S LIKE A DRUG.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.656
- ARE YOU EXCITED?
ARE YOU EXCITED?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.324
- I'M VERY EXCITED.
- DO YOU FEEL IT?

00:58.358 --> 00:59.492
- THE ADRENALINE,

00:59.526 --> 01:00.493
WHEN I'M ACTUALLY
GETTING THE DEAL DONE...

01:00.527 --> 01:02.062
- WE HAVE OURSELVES A DEAL.

01:02.095 --> 01:03.063
- THAT'S WHAT EXCITES ME.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.732
- IT'S AMAZING AND IT'S SEXY.

01:13.840 --> 01:19.346
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

01:19.379 --> 01:21.514
- I COME FROM
A REAL ESTATE FAMILY,

01:21.548 --> 01:24.184
BUT I GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME
THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.753
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.356
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:29.389 --> 01:32.092
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN.
- YES, I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.274
- MY NAME IS FREDRIK.
I'M 33 YEARS OLD.

01:48.308 --> 01:50.010
I'M ORIGINALLY FROM SWEDEN.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.778
I'M THIS YOUNG GUY
WHO CAME TO NEW YORK,

01:51.811 --> 01:54.414
AND I'VE SOLD $1 BILLION
OF REAL ESTATE

01:54.447 --> 01:56.316
SO FAR IN MY CAREER.

01:56.349 --> 01:57.584
[phone ringing]

01:57.617 --> 01:58.585
HEY.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.719
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IF I WAKE UP

01:59.753 --> 02:01.354
TWO HOURS EARLIER
BEFORE EVERYONE ELSE

02:01.388 --> 02:03.056
AND STAY IN THE OFFICE
TWO HOURS MORE,

02:03.056 --> 02:05.091
I'LL BE THE NUMBER ONE.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.726
CALL THE OTHER BROKER
AND PUT SOME PRESSURE ON HER.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.094
I LOVE NEW YORK REAL ESTATE.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.563
IT REALLY FITS ME PERFECTLY,
'CAUSE I'M CRAZY.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.098
WHOO!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.234
UH, AND THEN, OF COURSE,
THE MONEY, YEAH.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.070
HEY, CAMILLE.
- HEY.

02:17.103 --> 02:18.204
- WELCOME.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.906
- ONE OF THE NEWEST
DEVELOPMENTS IN MY LIFE

02:19.939 --> 02:20.907
IS THAT I'M CHANGING FIRMS.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.175
WHAT A GREAT EXPOSURE.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.711
MADISON AVENUE,
76TH STREET.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.880
THE MONEY THAT WALKS
BY THAT WINDOW IS INSANE.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.348
I MEAN, NOW WE'RE PLAYING
WITH THE BIG BOYS.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.150
AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
A LOT OF EYES ON US

02:30.183 --> 02:32.385
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR ME

02:32.419 --> 02:34.087
THAT I FEEL THAT
YOU'RE WITH ME ON THIS

02:34.087 --> 02:36.790
AND WE JUST WORK, LIKE,
NONSTOP, AROUND THE CLOCK.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.525
I WANT YOU TO WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING LIKE I DO.

02:38.558 --> 02:39.526
JUST JUMP UP AND DOWN.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.794
NO, REALLY, SERIOUSLY.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.429
WHEN IT COMES TO MY TEAM,
MY TEAM MEMBERS,

02:42.462 --> 02:44.397
I HAVE NO PATIENCE
FOR LAZINESS.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.832
UNPACK OUR BOXES QUICKLY.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.133
LET'S START CALLING BUYERS.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.502
WE NEED TO START GETTING
LISTINGS, SO LET'S START.

02:49.536 --> 02:51.304
THANKS.
- OKAY, GREAT.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.879
[birds singing]

02:59.913 --> 03:04.617
[alarm buzzing]

03:07.954 --> 03:09.889
- MY NAME
IS MICHAEL LORBER.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.624
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
REAL ESTATE RUNS IN MY FAMILY.

03:11.658 --> 03:12.859
HEY, DAD.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.327
MY DAD IS A CHAIRMAN
OF THE LARGEST

03:14.361 --> 03:15.962
RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE
BROKERAGE FIRM

03:16.062 --> 03:17.697
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY.

03:17.731 --> 03:21.768
I'VE LIVED AND BREATHED REAL
ESTATE SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID.

03:21.801 --> 03:24.137
BY TEN YEARS OLD,
AS A HOBBY ON THE WEEKENDS,

03:24.170 --> 03:26.072
I WOULD LOVE TO GO
AND TRY TO GET MY FAMILY

03:26.072 --> 03:27.640
TO TAKE ME TO OPEN HOUSES.

03:27.674 --> 03:29.275
YEAH, I'VE BEEN DYING
TO SEE THAT BUILDING.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.778
AFTER GETTING MY LAW DEGREE
AND THEN MY MASTER'S DEGREE,

03:31.811 --> 03:34.481
I DECIDED TO FOLLOW
IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.

03:34.514 --> 03:36.683
UP UNTIL NOW,
I'VE STUDIED REAL ESTATE,

03:36.716 --> 03:38.752
SO I GUESS I KNOW IT ALL
IN THEORY,

03:38.785 --> 03:43.256
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M
PRACTICING ENTIRELY ON MY OWN.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.958
I'VE HAD A LOT OF ADVANTAGES
IN MY LIFE.

03:44.991 --> 03:46.259
I LIKE A LOT OF NICE THINGS.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.762
YOU KNOW, I LIKE FINE ART,
I LIKE TRAVELING.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.530
I LIKE WATCHES,
I LIKE RARE BOOKS.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.866
I MEAN, LET'S FACE IT.
I LIKE LUXURY.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.434
WHO DOESN'T?

03:58.605 --> 04:02.042
- HEY.
- YOU LOOK DAPPER.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.610
- I HAD A CLIENT TODAY.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.883
MY DAD'S
A VERY INTIMIDATING GUY,

04:09.916 --> 04:12.152
AND I'M NOT EXEMPT FROM THAT
'CAUSE I'M HIS SON.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.620
YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT
JUST MY FATHER,

04:13.653 --> 04:15.055
BUT HE'S ALSO MY BOSS.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.523
BUT HE'D ALSO BE THE FIRST ONE
TO PROBABLY FIRE ME

04:16.556 --> 04:18.892
IF I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.593
IT'S FUNNY, THE WORDS
YOU CAN'T SAY NOW.

04:20.627 --> 04:22.829
I WAS GOING THROUGH THEM
WITH MY REAL ESTATE CLASSES.

04:22.862 --> 04:25.165
I MEAN, YEAH, YOU--YOU CAN'T
SAY "PRESTIGIOUS" NOW

04:25.198 --> 04:27.334
BECAUSE THAT MEANS, UH,

04:27.367 --> 04:28.735
"PRESTIGIOUS" MEANS
YOU'RE EXCLUDING,

04:28.768 --> 04:30.737
WHICH MEANS, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ELIMINATING

04:30.770 --> 04:32.605
A CERTAIN GROUP FROM
LIVING IN THE BUILDING.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.407
I GET, A LOT OF TIMES,
PEOPLE ASK,

04:34.441 --> 04:35.508
"A LOT OF FAMILIES
IN THIS BUILDING?"

04:35.542 --> 04:36.943
AND I CAN'T SAY YES OR NO.

04:36.976 --> 04:38.478
I HAVE TO SAY,
"WELL, YOU REALLY HAVE TO

04:38.511 --> 04:40.447
SIT IN THE LOBBY FOR AN HOUR
AND JUST SEE WHAT YOU SEE."

04:40.480 --> 04:41.681
THAT'S THE RI--
THAT'S LIKE THE--

04:41.715 --> 04:43.516
THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY
TO ANSWER.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.285
I HAVE A LIST OF WORDS
I CAN AND CAN'T SAY.

04:45.318 --> 04:46.686
- WELL, YOU BETTER SEND ME
A COPY OF THE LIST.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.687
- YEAH.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.422
- OH, BY THE WAY,
REBECCA SUMMIT.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.257
- THE SUMMIT, YEAH.
- IS THAT ONE TOWNHOUSE LEVEL?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.625
- RIGHT.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.427
- AND, UH, YOU KNOW, LEONARD'S
BEEN WORKING ON IT.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.829
OH, IS HE?
- YEAH.

04:55.862 --> 04:56.963
- AND I THINK YOU SHOULD,
LIKE, GET TOGETHER WITH HIM

04:56.996 --> 04:58.298
AND TRY TO HELP HIM
GET IT DONE.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.667
- YEAH, I'D LOVE TO GO.
THOSE ARE GREAT APARTMENTS.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.035
- NOT THAT LEONARD
NEEDS YOUR HELP, REALLY.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.336
- NO, I KNOW. LEONARD'S
A TOP BROKER DOWNTOWN.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.738
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

05:04.771 --> 05:05.939
- I CAN GET SOME MORE
DOWNTOWN EXPERIENCE.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.107
- YEAH, YOU'LL GET SOME
GOOD EXPERIENCE.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.675
- THIS IS SUCH A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME,

05:08.708 --> 05:10.343
MY DAD INTRODUCING ME
TO LEONARD.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.512
I HAVE A LOT OF GREAT
UPTOWN CLIENTS

05:12.545 --> 05:13.613
WHO ARE LOOKING
TO MOVE DOWNTOWN.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.348
I JUST REALLY NEED
TO CONVINCE LEONARD

05:15.382 --> 05:16.750
THAT I'M HIS MAN
AND I'M GONNA HELP HIM

05:16.783 --> 05:18.084
SELL THIS APARTMENT.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.185
I'LL DEFINITELY
CALL LEONARD.

05:19.219 --> 05:21.154
THAT WOULD BE FUN
TO WORK ON DOWNTOWN.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.162
- I'M RYAN SERHANT.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.064
I'M 26 YEARS OLD.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.333
NEW YORK REAL ESTATE
IS VERY DOG EAT DOG.

05:33.366 --> 05:34.567
- ONE, TWO, THREE.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.570
- GOOD REAL ESTATE AGENTS
HAVE TO BE FIGHTERS.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.605
- CROSS.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.207
- I DIDN'T COME
INTO REAL ESTATE

05:41.241 --> 05:44.377
WITH ANY KIND OF HOOK-UP,
SO I BASICALLY HAD TO START

05:44.411 --> 05:46.846
FROM SCRATCH.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.582
I AM INCREDIBLY HUNGRY.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.684
I MEAN, IF I WANT SOMETHING,
I'M GONNA GET IT,

05:50.717 --> 05:52.752
NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES,

05:52.786 --> 05:55.755
WHETHER IT COMES TO,
YOU KNOW, LISTINGS OR GIRLS.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.124
I HAVE VERY LITTLE TIME,
SO THE DRUNKER I GET YOU,

05:58.158 --> 06:00.760
THE FASTER, THE BETTER IT IS
FOR ME AND YOU IN THE END GAME.

06:00.794 --> 06:06.633
MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION,
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

06:06.666 --> 06:10.036
HEY, DINA?
- HEY, RYAN.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.772
- OKAY, SO I AM
GOING TO 120 RIVERSIDE.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.040
- OKAY, COOL.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.041
- SO CAN YOU GIVE ME
THE COMPS, PLEASE?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.109
- YEP, I'M ON IT.
- COOL.

06:16.142 --> 06:17.410
DINA IS THE BEST ASSISTANT
IN THE WORLD.

06:17.444 --> 06:18.878
I MEAN, SHE STAYS
ON TOP OF ME.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.114
- OKAY.
- COOL.

06:21.147 --> 06:24.250
I WENT ON A DATE LAST NIGHT.
- SHOCKER.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.785
- DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW IT WENT?

06:25.819 --> 06:28.455
- HMM, I WANT TO SAY...
NO.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.457
- COME ON, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE.

06:30.490 --> 06:31.791
- FINE,
'CAUSE YOU'RE BEGGING.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.226
- [sighs]

06:33.259 --> 06:35.228
HER NAME WAS, UH...

06:35.261 --> 06:36.629
- UH?

06:36.663 --> 06:38.665
- UH, I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.
I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.133
SHE'S SO HOT.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.435
I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO WALK FOR DAYS.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.937
[exhales]

06:43.970 --> 06:47.974
- RYAN, YOU DISGUST ME.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.110
- WHAT?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.312
WHY? I'M JUST BEING HONEST.
- OKAY.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.921
- LOUIE, WILL YOU TAKE ME
TO 70 LITTLE WEST STREET

07:02.022 --> 07:02.856
IN BATTERY PARK CITY?

07:02.889 --> 07:03.890
APPRECIATE IT.

07:07.027 --> 07:10.063
BATTERY PARK CITY IS ON THE
SOUTHWESTERN TIP OF MANHATTAN,

07:10.096 --> 07:12.232
BETWEEN GROUND ZERO
FINANCIAL DISTRICT

07:12.265 --> 07:14.401
AND HUDSON RIVER,
AND IT'S KNOWN

07:14.434 --> 07:16.136
FOR ITS PARKS
AND AMAZING VIEWS

07:16.169 --> 07:18.038
OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.610
THE VISIONAIRE IS ONE OF THE
GREENEST BUILDINGS IN THE WORLD.

07:23.643 --> 07:25.478
THAT'S VERY HOT ON THE AGENDA
RIGHT NOW FOR BUYERS.

07:25.512 --> 07:26.946
HEY, JOHN.
- FREDRIK, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

07:27.047 --> 07:28.481
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.050
JOHN IS A NEW CLIENT WHO NEEDS
A GOOD REAL ESTATE AGENT

07:30.050 --> 07:33.053
FOR TWO REASONS--ONE, TO SELL
HIS CURRENT APARTMENT,

07:33.053 --> 07:35.121
AND TWO, TO FIND HIM
A BIGGER ONE.

07:35.155 --> 07:36.690
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE VIEW.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.058
- YOU COULD SIT HERE
ALL DAY AND JUST--

07:38.091 --> 07:41.094
THE WATER JUST, YOU KNOW,
MESMERIZES YOU.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.977
- OKAY, SO LET'S, UH,
LET'S LOOK AT THE APARTMENT.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.044
AND THIS IS THE MASTER BATH?

08:31.077 --> 08:33.079
- THIS IS THE MASTER BATH,
YES.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.548
- YOU DID THE TOILETS, OR THEY
WERE DELIVERED LIKE THAT?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.083
- NO, WE--WE UPGRADED
THE TOILETS.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.185
WE PUT THESE ELECTRIC
FLUSH TOILETS IN.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.754
IF YOU GO BY IT,
IT'LL OPEN UP.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.923
IT ISN'T DOING IT.
ALL RIGHT.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.927
[laughter]

08:47.961 --> 08:50.330
- THE PRICE JUST WENT UP.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.299
CAN YOU SEE...YEAH,
THAT'S THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.768
AND I HEAR YOU HAVE, UH,

08:54.801 --> 08:56.136
I HEAR YOU HAVE
A NICE BOAT, TOO.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.638
- YEAH,
A 162-FOOT CHRISTENSEN,

08:58.672 --> 09:00.840
AND WE PARK IT RIGHT DOWN HERE
IN THE NORTH COVE.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.008
- RIGHT HERE?

09:02.042 --> 09:04.377
SO, UM, WHEN I SELL
THE APARTMENT FOR YOU,

09:04.411 --> 09:06.012
CAN I TAKE--CAN I SEE THE BOAT?
- OH, YEAH.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.380
- WILL YOU TAKE ME--
TAKE ME FOR A RIDE?

09:07.414 --> 09:08.415
- DEFINITELY.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.584
- I WANT TO HEAR
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA GO

09:11.618 --> 09:13.253
WHEN I SELL THIS FOR YOU.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.188
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO STAY
IN THE BUILDING.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.189
I'D LIKE TO GO UP HIGHER,

09:16.222 --> 09:18.191
AND, UH,
GET SOME MORE ROOM, YEAH.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.392
- OKAY, PERFECT.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.427
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY
MORE MONEY, THOUGH.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.895
YOU REALIZE THAT?
- I'M SURE.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.230
- JOHN IS DEFINITELY
THE QUIET, VERBOTEN TYPE,

09:24.264 --> 09:25.932
AND THE QUIET ONES
ARE ALWAYS TROUBLE.

09:26.032 --> 09:27.434
BUT, LOOK,
HE'S SELLING SOMETHING

09:27.467 --> 09:29.235
AND HE'S MOVING RIGHT UP
IN THE SAME BUILDING.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.570
THAT'S TWO COMMISSIONS.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.706
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT A PRICE
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.908
DO YOU HAVE
A SPECIFIC PRICE?

09:34.941 --> 09:37.911
- I-I THINK I SHOULD GET
AT LEAST, UH, 2.3 MILLION.

09:37.944 --> 09:42.215
- OKAY. I THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.884
AS A BROKER, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO FIGHT AND COMPETE

09:44.918 --> 09:47.554
WITH OTHER REMAINING UNITS
IN THE BUILDING,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.589
AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR US,
A SIMILAR APARTMENT,

09:49.622 --> 09:52.459
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOURS
WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO IT,

09:52.492 --> 09:54.527
CLOSED RECENTLY
FOR A LOT LESS.

09:54.561 --> 09:57.630
SO I THINK IF WE CAN
COMPROMISE AROUND 2.2...

10:01.001 --> 10:02.502
- I THOUGHT THAT,

10:02.535 --> 10:05.572
YOU KNOW, IF WE ASK 2.3,
MAYBE WE'LL GET 2.2.

10:05.605 --> 10:10.076
BUT IF WE ASK 2.2, UH, WE'RE
PROBABLY GONNA TAKE LESS.

10:10.110 --> 10:15.348
- UM, YOU WANT TO MOVE UP
WITHIN THE BUILDING.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.850
YOU WANT SOMETHING LARGER.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.351
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE YOUR MONEY.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.521
YOU USE ME, AND I'M GONNA
BROKERAGE THAT DEAL FOR YOU,

10:21.554 --> 10:24.057
AND WE'RE GONNA LEVERAGE
THIS PRICE, 2.2,

10:24.090 --> 10:25.291
INTO SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER,

10:25.325 --> 10:27.127
AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE

10:27.160 --> 10:30.030
THAT 50,000
OR 100,000 MORE.

10:32.999 --> 10:37.170
- IF WE'RE GONNA ASK 2.2,
I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET ME 2.1.

10:37.203 --> 10:40.106
YOU KNOW, I WANT 2.2. I DON'T
WANT YOU TO [bleep] THIS UP.

10:43.209 --> 10:46.579
- I'M FROM SWEDEN.
WE DON'T USE THAT WORD THERE.

10:46.613 --> 10:47.647
I'LL GET YOU 2.2.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.648
LET'S SIGN SOME LISTING
AGREEMENTS.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.316
6%.

10:50.350 --> 10:51.818
YOU SIGN THERE.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.188
- COMING UP...
- WAIT, WHAT IS THIS ROOM?

10:55.221 --> 10:56.189
WHAT IS THAT? A THUMBPRINT?
- YEAH.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.024
[beeps]
- WHOA.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.828
- I'M AT 2,375,000
AND NOT A PENNY MORE.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.073
- I'M HEADED OVER
TO 120 RIVERSIDE

11:13.073 --> 11:15.241
TO PITCH A LISTING RIGHT NOW.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.477
SOME OF THE BEST REAL ESTATE
IN NEW YORK CITY

11:17.510 --> 11:19.713
IS ON RIVERSIDE BOULEVARD.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.248
THE BOULEVARD IS PREMIER
WATERFRONT REAL ESTATE

11:22.282 --> 11:23.950
ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE
OF MANHATTAN.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.086
THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL APARTMENTS

11:26.086 --> 11:27.120
IN FULL-AMENITY BUILDINGS.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.089
SAYING THAT YOU LIVE
IN THOSE BUILDINGS,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.958
WHICH IS WHERE SAUDI PRINCES
AND A-ROD LIVES,

11:31.991 --> 11:34.260
IS CLASS STATUS.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.830
HEY.
- HEY.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.264
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY, RYAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:38.298 --> 11:39.532
- HEY, ADRIANA,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:39.566 --> 11:40.767
- KISSES.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.302
- I'VE KNOWN ADRIANA SOCIALLY
FOR A WHILE NOW.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.437
I MEAN, LOOK, AND WE HANG OUT
AT THE SAME CLUBS,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.239
AND WE MIX AND MINGLE IN
THE SAME GROUP OF FRIENDS.

11:46.272 --> 11:47.574
WHAT TIME DID YOU
GET IN LAST NIGHT?

11:47.607 --> 11:50.176
- LIKE 5:00 IN THE MORNING.
- 5:00 IN THE MORNING?

11:50.210 --> 11:54.347
SHE IS VERY MUCH
A SOCIALITE HEIRESS.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.149
COOL. SO YOU WANNA, LIKE,
JUST DO A LITTLE TOUR?

11:56.182 --> 11:57.150
- YEAH, SURE.
- KIND OF WALK THROUGH?

11:57.183 --> 11:58.184
- YEP.
- YEP.

12:26.112 --> 12:27.380
- WAIT, WHAT IS THIS ROOM?

12:27.414 --> 12:28.548
WHAT IS THAT, A THUMBPRINT?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.116
- YEAH, I'LL SHOW YOU
IN A LITTLE.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.152
[beep]

12:33.253 --> 12:34.654
- OKAY.
- DON'T BE SCARED.

12:34.688 --> 12:36.189
IT'S A LITTLE MESSY, OKAY?
- I'M KIND OF NERVOUS.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.526
I'M KIND OF NERVOUS.
OH, MY GOD.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.864
WHOA.

12:44.898 --> 12:48.301
SO NO ONE CAN GET IN HERE
BUT YOU?

12:48.335 --> 12:49.436
- NOT ME.
- SO, WAIT.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.338
SO YOU'RE PROTECTING THIS
AGAINST--

12:51.371 --> 12:53.540
AGAINST EDDIE OR--?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.108
- I GUESS MY GIRLFRIENDS.

12:55.141 --> 12:56.576
I DON'T WANT THEM COMING
TO CHANGE CLOTHES.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.911
[laughter]

12:57.944 --> 13:01.915
- AND THEN IN HERE, THERE'S
ABOUT 800 PAIR OF SHOES.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.316
- THERE'S 800 IN HERE?

13:03.350 --> 13:05.919
- HE COUNTED BECAUSE
HE WAS MAD AT ME ONE DAY.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.621
- I STARTED THINKING ABOUT HOW
I'M GONNA SHOW THIS APARTMENT.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.156
THERE'S GOTTA BE
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE

13:10.190 --> 13:11.524
WHO WOULD WANT TO PAY MONEY

13:11.558 --> 13:13.126
TO HAVE A PANIC ROOM
FOR CLOTHES.

13:13.159 --> 13:14.227
SORRY, I THINK I GOT
ONE OF THE--

13:14.260 --> 13:15.328
YEAH, IT WAS
A CHANEL JACKET

13:15.362 --> 13:16.363
THAT JUST KIND OF
FELL ON THE GROUND.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.397
THIS IS NICE.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.765
IT ALSO STILL HAS
ITS TAG ON IT.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.768
THAT'S A REALLY EXPENSIVE
CHANEL JACKET.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.503
- THAT'S A $9,000 JACKET.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.072
- THIS IS
THE SECOND BATHROOM.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.676
SO THESE ARE THE OTHER, I GUESS,
300 PAIRS OF SHOES.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.378
- WOW.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.380
AND THE CRAZIEST PART ABOUT
ADRIANA'S APARTMENT...

13:33.413 --> 13:37.550
- PRESS AND GO,
ON THE FEET.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.985
- INTERESTING.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.289
LET'S TALK ABOUT SELLING
YOUR APARTMENT.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.659
SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT POSSIBLY...

13:46.693 --> 13:50.897
POSSIBLY DECLUTTERING
THE SPACE A LITTLE BIT.

13:54.467 --> 13:55.568
HEY, LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING

13:55.602 --> 13:58.471
WE HAVE TO, LIKE,
GET RID OF EVERYTHING.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.440
WE JUST WANT TO
KIND OF SLIM DOWN.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.574
WE COMPROMISE.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.076
THAT'S WHAT RELATIONSHIPS
ARE ABOUT.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.811
I MEAN, LOOK, SOMETIMES WHEN
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE SOMEONE

14:04.844 --> 14:06.346
TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY
DON'T REALLY WANT TO DO,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.948
YOU GOTTA--YOU GOTTA
TURN ON THE CHARM.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.950
YOU GOTTA BE SMILEY.
YOU GOTTA SHOW THE DIMPLE.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.252
YEAH, YOU'VE GOT TO FLIRT
WITH THEM A LITTLE BIT.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.386
AND I WANT TO BE YOUR BROKER.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.654
- SO NOW WE'RE GONNA BUILD
A RELATIONSHIP?

14:14.688 --> 14:18.224
- MM-HMM.
THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING FOR.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.626
COOL. SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT PRICE.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.561
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WHAT ARE YOU IN FOR?

14:21.594 --> 14:25.799
- WE'RE IN FOR ABOUT
4 AND CHANGE.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.667
- HONESTLY, THERE ARE NO COMPS
FOR THIS APARTMENT.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.203
JUST, I MEAN, PFFT,
WHAT OTHER DUPLEX

14:30.236 --> 14:32.605
WITH WHITE CARRERA MARBLE
THROUGHOUT IT

14:32.639 --> 14:33.707
EXISTS ON THE BOULEVARD?

14:33.740 --> 14:36.176
IT DOESN'T.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:36.209 --> 14:39.112
LIKE, 4...4.4?

14:42.816 --> 14:44.317
DEAL?

14:44.351 --> 14:46.553
- DEAL.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.388
- HANDSHAKE?
- A FIRM ONE.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.124
- THANK YOU.
- HANDSHAKE? ALL RIGHT.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.227
SO LET'S GO.
IT'S GO TIME.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.568
- [groans]

15:01.601 --> 15:03.269
HEY, TOM.
[groans]

15:03.303 --> 15:04.437
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, MIKE?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.039
- GOOD. WE'RE GOING OUT
TO, UH, TRIBECA,

15:06.039 --> 15:07.240
DOWN TO GREENWICH STREET.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.409
- YOU GOT IT.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.777
- TRIBECA IS A NEIGHBORHOOD
IN LOWER MANHATTAN.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.847
THE NAME STANDS FOR
"TRIANGLE BELOW CANAL."

15:13.880 --> 15:16.182
TRIBECA IS ONE OF THE HOTTEST
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEW YORK.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.818
EVERYONE WANTS THAT NEW
YORK-STYLE LOFT APARTMENT.

15:18.852 --> 15:20.153
THEY WANT TO BE NEAR
ALL THE CELEBRITIES

15:20.186 --> 15:23.890
THAT FLOCK DOWN THERE,
LIKE ROBERT DENIRO AND JAY-Z.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.658
- HEY, MICHAEL.
- HEY.

15:25.692 --> 15:26.960
- HOW ARE YOU?
- LEONARD, WHAT'S UP?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.261
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:28.294 --> 15:29.396
- LEONARD'S PROBABLY

15:29.429 --> 15:31.064
ONE OF THE BEST DOWNTOWN BROKERS
IN NEW YORK,

15:31.064 --> 15:33.199
SO I'M REALLY PSYCHED MY DAD
PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.567
- WELL,
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELL-DRESSED.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.603
VERY SHARP.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.806
EXACTLY.

15:39.839 --> 15:42.509
- ON-SITE BROKERS USUALLY WORK
AT A NEW DEVELOPMENT

15:42.542 --> 15:45.512
AND STRICTLY SELL THE ACTUAL
APARTMENTS IN THAT DEVELOPMENT,

15:45.545 --> 15:47.514
AND A LOT OF TIMES,
THESE ON-SITE BROKERS

15:47.547 --> 15:49.649
WILL CALL SOME OF THEIR FRIENDS
IN THE BROKERAGE COMMUNITY

15:49.683 --> 15:51.551
AND SAY, "HEY,
WORK ON THIS WITH ME.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.852
WE'LL SELL TOGETHER."

15:52.886 --> 15:54.654
- SO THIS IS THE UNIT.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.691
- WHO'S--WHO DID
YOUR STAGING HERE?

15:57.724 --> 16:01.394
- AMY SHAIR.
SHE'S REALLY GOOD.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.430
THE AMAZING THING
ABOUT THIS SPACE IS,

16:03.463 --> 16:06.032
YOU GET INCREDIBLE
CEILING HEIGHTS.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.104
SO THIS IS THE MASTER
BEDROOM SUITE,

16:11.137 --> 16:13.673
AND IT'S REALLY INCREDIBLE.

16:13.707 --> 16:16.209
- NICE.
I LOVE THE WINDOWS.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.116
- YOU ENTER OFF THE STREET.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.184
YOU HAVE THESE BIG,
BEAUTIFUL WINDOWS

16:24.217 --> 16:25.752
THAT LET IN A LOT OF LIGHT.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.625
SO I THINK
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL

16:32.659 --> 16:33.793
IF YOU COULD HELP US,

16:33.827 --> 16:36.329
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE CONNECTION

16:36.363 --> 16:38.431
TO THE UPTOWN WORLD.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.066
- LEONARD KNOWS I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF EXPERIENCE

16:40.100 --> 16:41.801
SELLING PROPERTIES,
BUT WHAT I DO HAVE

16:41.835 --> 16:43.837
IS A HUGE ROLODEX
OF UPTOWN CLIENTS

16:43.870 --> 16:46.606
LOOKING FOR LOFTS DOWNTOWN.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.108
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
ASKING FOR NOW?

16:48.141 --> 16:49.676
- 3.75.
- YEAH.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.877
SO HOW WOULD WE
STRUCTURE THIS?

16:50.910 --> 16:52.212
'CAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE
THE LISTING, RIGHT?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.180
- RIGHT. WELL, I THINK WE CAN
KEEP IT REALLY SIMPLE.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.850
IF FOR SOME REASON
YOU BRING IN THE BUYER

16:56.883 --> 16:58.551
AND YOU HAVE A WHOLE--
- FOR SOME REASON?

16:58.585 --> 16:59.686
[laughs]

17:01.054 --> 17:04.858
- UM, IF YOU BRING IN
A BUYER,

17:04.891 --> 17:06.326
WE'LL JUST SPLIT
THE COMMISSION

17:06.359 --> 17:07.327
AND KEEP IT VERY SIMPLE.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.462
IF I SELL IT ON MY OWN,

17:09.496 --> 17:11.031
THEN, OF COURSE, I'LL TAKE
ALL THE COMMISSION.

17:11.031 --> 17:14.167
- SURE, LEONARD HAS A LOT MORE
EXPERIENCE THAN I DO,

17:14.200 --> 17:16.836
BUT ON THE OTHER,
I'VE GOT A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE,

17:16.870 --> 17:18.104
I'VE GOT GREAT CONTACTS,

17:18.138 --> 17:20.073
AND I CAN ALWAYS GO
TO MY DAD FOR HELP,

17:20.106 --> 17:21.908
SO IT KIND OF LEVELS OUT
THE PLAYING FIELD.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.379
SO I GOTTA ACT QUICK
AND GET SOMEONE DOWN HERE

17:26.413 --> 17:27.380
BEFORE YOU SELL IT.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.815
- VERY QUICKLY.
VERY QUICKLY.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.949
- SO IT'LL GET COMPETITIVE,
I GUESS.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.284
- I LIKE COMPETITION.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.694
- I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD
WITH THE ON-SITE SALES AGENT

17:40.727 --> 17:43.697
AT THE VISIONAIRE TO FIND JOHN
A BIGGER APARTMENT

17:43.730 --> 17:44.831
ON A HIGHER FLOOR.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.700
CHA-CHING.
I FOUND ONE.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.801
THANK YOU.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.302
NORMALLY A BUYER
WOULD WAIT

17:49.336 --> 17:50.303
TO BUY A NEW APARTMENT

17:50.337 --> 17:51.838
UNTIL HE SOLD HIS OLD ONE,

17:51.871 --> 17:54.441
BUT JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE
SOME DISCRETIONARY MONEY,

17:54.474 --> 17:55.842
AND I LOVE THAT.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.210
HOW MANY STORIES
IN THIS BUILDING?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.211
- IT'S A 35-STORY BUILDING.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.213
WE'RE ON THE 27TH FLOOR.

18:00.246 --> 18:03.516
- THAT REALLY LOOKS BETTER
FROM UP HERE THAN DOWNSTAIRS.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.518
- SO NOW IT'S MY JOB
TO GET THEM DOWN

18:05.552 --> 18:08.688
FROM THEIR VERY HIGH
ASKING PRICE OF 2.8 MILLION.

18:08.722 --> 18:11.224
CLOSING CENTER.
LET'S CLOSE THIS DEAL.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.027
THE OFFER THAT I'M AUTHORIZED
TO GIVE YOU--

18:14.027 --> 18:17.030
2,375,000.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.468
- WELL, HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THIS NUMBER?

18:21.501 --> 18:22.635
- HE CAME UP WITH IT.

18:22.669 --> 18:23.670
- HOW DID HE COME UP
WITH THIS NUMBER?

18:23.703 --> 18:25.271
- THAT'S WHAT
HE WANTS TO PAY.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.773
- WELL, WHAT PEOPLE
WANT TO PAY

18:26.806 --> 18:28.675
IS NOT WHAT THINGS
ARE WORTH.

18:28.708 --> 18:31.044
- I THINK--WELL, WHAT WAS
THE LAST B-LINE YOU SOLD?

18:31.044 --> 18:33.179
- WE JUST SOLD
THE 28TH FLOOR.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.814
- FOR HOW MUCH?
- 2.4.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.616
- SO THERE WE GO.
HE WASN'T THAT WRONG.

18:36.649 --> 18:37.684
- YEAH, SO WE'RE IN
THE BALLPARK,

18:37.717 --> 18:39.686
BUT THAT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO.
- HMM.

18:39.719 --> 18:43.790
- LOOK, FREDRIK, 2.4 IS--
IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

18:44.758 --> 18:45.792
- I'M CLEVER.

18:45.825 --> 18:48.061
I TOOK THEIR OWN COMP
FROM A YEAR AGO

18:48.061 --> 18:49.129
AND I THREW IT BACK
AT THEM,

18:49.162 --> 18:51.931
AND I GOT THEM DOWN
$400,000 IN PRICE.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.634
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW
IS GET THE LAST $25,000

18:54.668 --> 18:55.735
OFF THE PRICE FOR JOHN.

18:55.769 --> 18:57.270
- HELLO.
- HEY, JOHN.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.738
WE'RE TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT A PRICE

18:58.772 --> 19:01.007
THAT WOULD WORK FOR YOU
FOR 27-B.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.284
UNDERSTOOD.
THANK YOU, JOHN.

19:11.317 --> 19:15.689
YEAH, IT'S VERY SIMPLE.
"NOT A PENNY MORE."

19:15.722 --> 19:17.257
- IT'S 2.4 MILLION
WE NEED TO GET TO.

19:17.290 --> 19:21.861
- ARE YOU GONNA LOSE
2,375,000 OVER 25,000?

19:21.895 --> 19:23.797
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.432
- HE'S GONNA LOSE
A GREAT HOME OVER $25,000?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.133
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE
TO ME, EITHER.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.704
- I RESPECT HIS DECISION.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.775
- IT'S $25,000.

19:35.809 --> 19:38.745
WE'RE PAYING A 4% COMMISSION.
LET'S GET CREATIVE HERE.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.481
1% IS ABOUT $25,000.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.049
- BUT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO COME
DOWN IN COMMISSION.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.417
- I WORK FOR THE DEVELOPER.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.086
I GET PAID THE SAME
EITHER WAY.

19:46.119 --> 19:48.555
I'M ASKING YOU TO HELP ME
BRIDGE THE GAP HERE.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.889
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
IF I WOULD COME DOWN

19:49.923 --> 19:53.727
FROM 4% TO 3%,
WE HAVE A DEAL?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.895
- THAT'S RIGHT.

19:55.929 --> 19:57.931
- AI-YI-YI.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.101
- DO THE MATH.

20:02.369 --> 20:06.139
- $72,000.

20:06.172 --> 20:10.343
$72,000
IS BETTER THAN ZERO.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.645
I GUESS IT'S A WIN,
WIN, WIN.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.114
- THAT'S RIGHT.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.582
- I'LL GET YOU THE DEAL SHEET
TODAY,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
AND I'M GONNA CALL MY CLIENT
AND TELL HIM THE GOOD NEWS.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.119
THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.421
- SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE
NEGOTIATING FOR A BUYER,

20:21.454 --> 20:22.489
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE SELLER

20:22.522 --> 20:24.391
THINK THAT YOU'RE DOING HIM
A FAVOR.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.993
SO I CAME DOWN
IN COMMISSION.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.328
WILL I DO IT AGAIN?

20:28.361 --> 20:29.963
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.399
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOT A SALE.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.533
AND NOW I'M GONNA
GO DOWNSTAIRS

20:33.566 --> 20:36.636
AND GET ANOTHER
COMMISSION CHECK.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.704
- COMING UP...

20:37.737 --> 20:39.105
- SO THIS IS
THE FIRST BEDROOM.

20:39.139 --> 20:43.209
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I'M GONNA BACK UP OVER HERE.

20:43.243 --> 20:46.112
- CRA--WOW.

20:56.289 --> 20:59.359
- HEY, I NEED YOU TO SEND OUT
SOME EMAIL BLASTS

20:59.392 --> 21:01.494
FOR THE VISIONAIRE
AND, UH,

21:01.528 --> 21:03.596
I NEED AN AD
BEFORE THE END OF THE DAY.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.931
CAN YOU DO THIS FOR ME?

21:09.202 --> 21:11.071
A PRIVATE SHOWING?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.806
OKAY, JUSTIN,
YOU JUST MADE MY DAY.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.140
THAT'S VERY GOOD NEWS.

21:19.145 --> 21:21.481
[phone ringing]

21:21.514 --> 21:23.817
- HEY, VINCENT, IT'S
MICHAEL LORBER. HOW ARE YOU?

21:23.850 --> 21:25.852
- HEY, GREAT.
HOW ARE YOU?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.554
- I GOT A NEW LISTING
DOWNTOWN.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.155
YOU KNOW,
THE TRIBECA SUMMIT.

21:29.189 --> 21:30.623
THE COMPETITION IS ON.

21:30.657 --> 21:33.326
I'M DETERMINED TO SELL THIS
APARTMENT BEFORE LEONARD.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.095
THERE'S NOT MANY UNITS
LEFT THERE.

21:35.095 --> 21:37.330
NO, I SAID ARTISTS.
IT'S PERFECT FOR ARTISTS.

21:37.364 --> 21:39.733
WITH MY ROLODEX,
I KNOW I CAN DO IT.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.434
HEY, KIMBERLY,
IT'S MICHAEL LORBER.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.635
HOW ARE YOU?

21:42.669 --> 21:45.005
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?
- I'M GOOD.

21:45.105 --> 21:46.539
KIMBERLY IS SOMEONE

21:46.573 --> 21:49.009
THAT I'VE KNOWN FOR
A COUPLE YEARS SOCIALLY,

21:49.109 --> 21:51.378
AND I'VE HEARD THAT
SHE'S IN THE MARKET.

21:51.411 --> 21:54.280
ARE YOU STILL LOOKING FOR
A PLACE IN NEW YORK CITY?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.516
- WELL, YEAH, I AM.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.824
- TELL ME ABOUT THE APARTMENT.

22:04.858 --> 22:07.060
- I RUN THE STUDIO THERE
DURING THE DAY,

22:07.060 --> 22:08.762
AND SO THERE'S FABRICS
EVERYWHERE.

22:08.795 --> 22:10.096
- IS THIS YOURS?

22:10.130 --> 22:11.965
- YES. I MADE IT
OUT OF A TABLECLOTH.

22:12.065 --> 22:12.966
- REALLY?
- [laughs]

22:13.066 --> 22:15.068
- I LOVE THAT.
I LOVE THAT.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.136
EVERY SINGLE DAY,
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE,

22:16.169 --> 22:17.370
IT'S ABOUT GETTING
NEW BUSINESS,

22:17.404 --> 22:20.640
SO YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND ME WINING
AND DINING SOMEONE

22:20.674 --> 22:22.375
TO TRY TO LAND A NEW CLIENT.

22:22.409 --> 22:23.743
AND YOU COULD STAY IN SOHO.

22:23.777 --> 22:24.744
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
ANYWHERE ELSE.

22:24.778 --> 22:25.845
BECAUSE I THINK, FOR ME,

22:25.879 --> 22:27.380
I MEAN, I THINK
THAT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.

22:27.414 --> 22:31.618
IN NEW YORK CITY, REAL ESTATE
IS A SMALL, SMALL WORLD.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.853
THE BIG AGENTS,
EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER.

22:33.887 --> 22:36.990
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY.

22:37.090 --> 22:38.692
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:38.725 --> 22:40.694
BUT THERE'S MORE THAN
300,000 RESTAURANTS

22:40.727 --> 22:42.662
IN NEW YORK CITY ALONE,

22:42.696 --> 22:45.231
AND FREDRIK HAPPENS JUST TO BE
STROLLING THROUGH THIS ONE?

22:45.265 --> 22:48.234
FREDRIK IS A SHARK,
AND HE DOES WHAT SHARKS DO.

22:48.268 --> 22:49.235
HE SMELLS BLOOD.

22:49.269 --> 22:50.770
- ARE YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US?

22:50.804 --> 22:53.740
- THIS IS BONNIE YOUNG.
- BONNIE YOUNG. FREDRIK EKLUND.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.442
NICE TO MEET YOU.
- DO YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER?

22:55.475 --> 22:57.711
- NO.
- YEAH.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.380
WE WORK IN THE SAME INDUSTRY.
- RIGHT.

23:00.413 --> 23:01.648
- RYAN JUST GOT STARTED.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.451
I'VE BEEN WORKING FOR, UH,
NINE YEARS.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.186
- NO, HE'S MUCH OLDER
THAN ME.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.188
- RYAN, YOU WERE AN ACTOR.
- RIGHT, HE WAS AN ACTOR BEFORE.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.456
- SO WAS FREDRIK.
- YEAH.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.690
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF ACTING.

23:10.724 --> 23:15.228
- HE, UH, HE'S DONE GAY PORN.
- REALLY?

23:15.261 --> 23:16.363
- YEAH.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.832
- TEN YEARS AGO,
I DID SOME MOVIES. GAY PORN.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.968
AND I THINK YOU CAN SEE IN
MY EYES THAT I DON'T REGRET IT.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.604
UM, I NEVER, EVER TRY
TO HIDE IT.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.172
I--YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA OWN IT.

23:26.206 --> 23:28.074
SO YOU'RE SELLING
AN APARTMENT?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.542
- POSSIBLY.

23:29.576 --> 23:32.579
- WELL, YOU KNOW, NO BROKER
HAS MORE BUYERS THAN I DO.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.580
YEAH, OF COURSE.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.948
- SURE, SIT DOWN.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.116
- HE SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.

23:36.149 --> 23:38.551
HE JUST TOLD ME HE DID
$100 MILLION THIS YEAR.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.353
- REALLY?
I DID A BILLION.

23:40.387 --> 23:42.088
- WOW.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.557
- THE ONLY WAY TO BE SUCCESSFUL
IN NEW YORK CITY,

23:44.591 --> 23:48.228
WHICH IS A CUTTHROAT BUSINESS,
YOU HAVE TO SELL YOURSELF.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.929
I'LL GIVE YOU MY CARD

23:49.963 --> 23:53.466
IN THE EVENT YOU WANT TO
ACTUALLY SELL THE APARTMENT

23:53.500 --> 23:54.901
AND NOT JUST LIST IT.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.302
I HAVE A VERY GOOD INTUITION

23:56.336 --> 24:00.073
AND, UH, I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GONNA
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.441
- DOESN'T HE HAVE
HIS OWN CLIENTS?

24:01.474 --> 24:03.143
HE'S DONE A BILLION DOLLARS
WORTH OF REAL ESTATE.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.078
- YOU'RE LOVELY.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.312
- COOL. DUDE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:06.346 --> 24:07.313
- IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:07.347 --> 24:08.214
- REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU TOO.

24:08.248 --> 24:11.718
ENJOY YOUR, UH...

24:11.751 --> 24:13.219
- IT'S VERY GOOD.

24:13.253 --> 24:14.587
- BONNIE, CALL ME.

24:14.621 --> 24:17.590
LET'S GO AND HAVE LUNCH
AT THE FOUR SEASONS.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.591
SEE YOU GUYS.
- SEE YOU.

24:18.625 --> 24:19.626
- BYE.

24:26.599 --> 24:29.402
- THANK YOU. OVER HERE?

24:29.436 --> 24:31.404
- KIMBERLY'S
AN AMAZING WOMAN

24:31.438 --> 24:32.806
WITH TWO SONS
IN THEIR EARLY 20s.

24:32.839 --> 24:34.240
REALLY ARTISTIC.

24:34.274 --> 24:36.443
I THOUGHT OF HER 'CAUSE SHE'S
LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT

24:36.476 --> 24:38.478
IN AN ARTSY NEIGHBORHOOD
JUST LIKE TRIBECA.

24:38.511 --> 24:41.214
- WOW, LOOK AT THIS.
- SO, YEAH, THIS IS IT.

24:41.247 --> 24:42.716
YOU'RE RIGHT ON
THE STREET HERE.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.883
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT ALL.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.218
THIS IS LIKE THE GRAND
ENTERTAINING FLOOR.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.986
GREAT FOR YOU FOR--
- YEAH, PARTIES.

24:47.087 --> 24:48.321
- ALL THE PARTIES
AND, YOU KNOW,

24:48.355 --> 24:50.090
IT KIND OF ALMOST COULD
DOUBLE AS AN ART GALLERY.

24:50.090 --> 24:51.257
- YEAH.
WELL, ACTUALLY, YES.

24:51.291 --> 24:53.093
- SHE'S REALLY WITH
THE WHOLE ART SCENE.

24:53.126 --> 24:54.561
ONE OF HER SONS
IS A GREAT ARTIST.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.696
THE OTHER ONE IS GONNA BE
A GREAT FILM PRODUCER.

24:56.730 --> 24:58.965
AND I THINK, IN THIS AREA,
IT'D JUST BE A GREAT PLACE

24:58.998 --> 25:01.167
FOR THEM TO LIVE AND BREATHE
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

25:01.201 --> 25:02.268
SO LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

25:02.302 --> 25:03.436
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
THE BEDROOMS

25:03.470 --> 25:07.273
AND HOW EACH IS KIND OF
LAID OUT DIFFERENTLY.

25:07.307 --> 25:08.308
SO THIS WOULD BE
ONE BEDROOM.

25:08.341 --> 25:09.342
- BUT THIS IS A BEDROOM?
- YEAH.

25:09.376 --> 25:10.677
- THIS IS PRETTY.

25:10.710 --> 25:13.546
- VERY SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE.
- RIGHT. IT'S VERY--

25:13.580 --> 25:15.682
- BUT IT HAS A LITTLE TERRACE.
- AND THIS IS THE MASTER.

25:15.715 --> 25:16.850
- WHERE YOU HAVE
THE ORIGINAL BIG WINDOWS

25:16.883 --> 25:18.051
OVERLOOKING LAKE STREET.

25:18.084 --> 25:20.120
- IT'S SO PRETTY. YEAH.
THIS IS A NICE ROOM.

25:20.153 --> 25:21.955
- KIMBERLY REALLY SEEMED
TO LIKE THE APARTMENT,

25:22.055 --> 25:24.090
BUT YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW
SOMEBODY'S LOVE

25:24.124 --> 25:25.358
FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY

25:25.392 --> 25:27.093
UNTIL THERE'S A DOLLAR SIGN
IN FRONT OF IT.

25:27.127 --> 25:28.595
- CAN I SIT DOWN ON THE BED?

25:28.628 --> 25:30.130
- OKAY. YOU GET THAT SIDE?

25:30.163 --> 25:31.131
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

25:31.164 --> 25:32.332
- I'LL SIT HERE?
- YEAH.

25:32.365 --> 25:33.533
- OKAY.

25:33.566 --> 25:34.968
- NO, LOOK AT THE VIEW.

25:35.068 --> 25:37.070
- OH, AND YOU LOOK--YEAH,
YOU REALLY LOOK UP ON THE--

25:37.070 --> 25:38.505
- I LIKE THAT.
- THE TRIBECA HERE.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.073
- AND I LIKE THE LIGHT.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.608
- THIS IS A COOL SPACE.
- YEAH.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.810
SO TELL ME, MICHAEL,

25:43.843 --> 25:46.846
WHAT DOES A PLACE LIKE THIS
GO FOR IN TRIBECA?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.615
- YOU KNOW, THE DEVELOPER
STILL OWNS THIS UNIT.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.783
- UH-HUH.

25:49.816 --> 25:50.784
- I'M WORKING WITH
ANOTHER BROKER HERE.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.586
WE'RE ASKING 3.75 MILLION.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.921
BUT I THINK
THERE'S SOME ROOM.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.823
YOU KNOW, I THINK IF
THERE'S A 3 IN FRONT OF IT--

25:56.856 --> 25:57.991
- UH-HUH.

25:58.091 --> 25:59.359
- YOU KNOW, WE COULD PROBABLY
GET A DEAL DONE.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.127
I'VE DONE A LOT OF DEALS IN,
YOU KNOW, BOARDROOMS

26:01.161 --> 26:03.763
AND LIVING ROOMS AND CARS
AND CONFERENCE ROOMS,

26:03.797 --> 26:05.832
BUT NEVER IN A BEDROOM,
REALLY.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.167
- SO YOU THINK THIS IS
A PRETTY GOOD DEAL?

26:07.200 --> 26:09.369
- I DO. I MEAN, I THINK
IT SHOULD GO FAST.

26:09.402 --> 26:12.072
- OKAY.
WE SHOULD MAKE AN OFFER.

26:12.105 --> 26:13.139
- OKAY.

26:13.173 --> 26:14.774
- I'M THINKING A LOW 3,
MICHAEL.

26:14.808 --> 26:17.077
- OKAY. WELL, IT DOESN'T
GET ANY LOWER THAN 3.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.178
- 3. [laughs]
- OKAY.

26:18.211 --> 26:19.479
- YOU THINK THAT MIGHT,
YOU KNOW, DO IT?

26:19.512 --> 26:20.780
- YEAH.

26:20.814 --> 26:21.815
- 3'S A GREAT NUMBER
BUT 2'S EVEN BETTER.

26:21.848 --> 26:22.949
- IF WE GAVE HIM 2.9, 2.8,
YOU KNOW,

26:23.049 --> 26:23.950
HE'S JUST GONNA LAUGH AT US.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.051
- HE'S--YEAH.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.419
- BUT HE'LL SEE 3
AND KNOW--

26:26.453 --> 26:27.654
- AND THINK IT'S SERIOUS?
- THAT WE'RE SERIOUS.

26:27.687 --> 26:29.189
THIS IS GREAT.
I GOT AN OFFER.

26:29.222 --> 26:31.324
IT'S A LITTLE LOW, BUT IT'S GOT
THE 3 IN FRONT OF IT,

26:31.358 --> 26:33.159
AND I THINK IT'S THE PERFECT
STARTING POINT.

26:33.193 --> 26:35.528
- I THINK WE'VE BEEN IN BED
LONG ENOUGH NOW, DON'T YOU?

26:35.562 --> 26:36.963
- TO WHAT, CLOSE A DEAL?
- YEAH.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.231
[laughter]

26:38.264 --> 26:39.632
- THIS IS THE MOST FUN
I'VE EVER HAD IN BED.

26:39.666 --> 26:41.401
- OH, THERE YOU GO.
POOR THING.

26:48.742 --> 26:51.711
- JOHN HAS ALREADY BOUGHT
A THREE-BEDROOM UPSTAIRS,

26:51.745 --> 26:52.979
AND I HAVEN'T
SOLD THIS ONE YET.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.681
THE CLOCK IS TICKING.
THE PRESSURE'S ON.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.716
NICE TO MEET YOU.
AND THIS IS THE VISIONAIRE.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.818
WELCOME. NOW, ONE THING.

26:58.852 --> 27:00.120
UM, I HOPE IT'S NOT
A PROBLEM FOR YOU.

27:00.153 --> 27:01.921
THE SELLER IS ACTUALLY
IN THE APARTMENT.

27:02.022 --> 27:04.858
- OH, OKAY. THAT'S FINE.
- THAT'S FINE?

27:04.891 --> 27:06.593
- YEAH.
- OKAY. FOLLOW ME.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.796
JOHN?
- HEY, COME IN, COME IN.

27:09.829 --> 27:11.931
- SORRY ABOUT THIS
LAST-MINUTE SHOWING.

27:12.032 --> 27:14.501
I HAD A BUYER--WELL,
A BUYER'S REP, I SHOULD SAY.

27:14.534 --> 27:16.936
- TOM.
- MY PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, TOM.

27:17.037 --> 27:18.405
- THIS IS THE APARTMENT.
- OKAY.

27:18.438 --> 27:22.108
- AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE VIEW IS JUST MAGNIFICENT.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.077
AND HERE IS THE MASTER BATH.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.945
- BOY, THAT'S A PRETTY
HIGH-TECH TOILET.

27:26.046 --> 27:27.781
- YES, IT'S ACTUALLY
A SMALL,

27:27.814 --> 27:29.449
VERY HIGH-TECH SPACESHIP

27:29.482 --> 27:31.851
THAT HAS LANDED
FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

27:31.885 --> 27:33.219
- I'M NOT SURE I'D KNOW
HOW TO USE THAT.

27:33.253 --> 27:35.622
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO--
GO--GO TOWARDS IT?

27:35.655 --> 27:37.791
- THERE IT GOES.
- THERE WE GO.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.325
HOW MUCH IS IT?
JOHN, HOW MUCH IS IT?

27:39.359 --> 27:41.528
- UH, IT'S 5,500.

27:41.561 --> 27:43.930
- WHO KNEW THAT THE TALKING
TOILET, THE MOVING TOILET

27:43.963 --> 27:46.466
WAS GONNA BE THE SELLING POINT
FOR THIS APARTMENT?

27:46.499 --> 27:48.401
- AND, UH, AND THIS IS
A GREEN BUILDING, TOO?

27:48.435 --> 27:50.837
- THE GREENEST IN AMERICA.
- YEAH. WOW.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.373
I THINK THIS IS JUST EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR.

27:53.406 --> 27:55.575
- AND THE TOILETS.
- AND THE TOILETS, OF COURSE.

27:55.608 --> 27:58.411
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF, UH,
GOING FROM THE WEST VILLAGE

27:58.445 --> 28:00.447
DOWN TO BATTERY PARK CITY IS
A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT,

28:00.480 --> 28:02.282
YOU KNOW,
TRANSITION FOR HIM.

28:02.315 --> 28:03.516
- THE WEST VILLAGE--

28:03.550 --> 28:06.720
WHY THE [bleep] WOULD YOU
WANT TO LIVE THERE?

28:06.753 --> 28:08.488
- OH, BOY.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.457
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU DON'T
WANT TO HAVE A BUYER

28:10.490 --> 28:14.627
AND A SELLER MEET
AT A SHOWING.

28:14.661 --> 28:17.230
- THIS IS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL
PLACE TO LIVE.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.032
- WELL, THE WEST VILLAGE
IS NICE.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.368
IT'S TREE-LINED.
IT'S VERY QUIET.

28:21.401 --> 28:23.269
- YOU KNOW, IN MY OPINION,
YOU KNOW,

28:23.303 --> 28:26.706
IT DOESN'T COMPARE
TO A PLACE LIKE THIS.

28:26.740 --> 28:29.743
- OKAY, SO LET'S GO
TO THE LIVING ROOM.

28:29.776 --> 28:30.910
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:30.944 --> 28:32.779
- UH, WHAT'S
IT LISTED FOR?

28:32.812 --> 28:34.114
- 2.2.

28:34.147 --> 28:35.115
- UM, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE

28:35.148 --> 28:36.483
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OVER HIS BUDGET,

28:36.516 --> 28:38.685
SO I'LL JUST HAVE TO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THE PRICE AND--

28:38.718 --> 28:40.053
- WHAT IS HIS BUDGET?

28:40.053 --> 28:42.355
- UH, HE'S LOOKING IN
AROUND 1.8.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.224
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH.

28:44.257 --> 28:45.925
- YEAH, THAT'S TOO LOW
FOR US.

28:45.959 --> 28:46.926
- YEAH,
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

28:46.960 --> 28:47.927
- OKAY.

28:47.961 --> 28:49.062
- YOU HAVE TO
BRING HIM UP HERE.

28:49.062 --> 28:50.630
LET'S SHOW HIM AROUND AND--
- YEAH.

28:50.663 --> 28:51.798
- GET HIM UP
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.433
- I'LL TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THAT.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.135
SO WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU,
UH, PRETTY QUICKLY.

29:01.374 --> 29:04.010
- I WANT TO START SHOWING
ADRIANA'S APARTMENT

29:04.044 --> 29:05.111
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

29:05.145 --> 29:07.781
BUT I JUST CAN'T START
SHOWING IT

29:07.814 --> 29:10.450
WHEN THE ROOMS ARE STACKED
TO THE CEILING WITH STUFF.

29:10.483 --> 29:11.785
WOW.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.586
AT TIMES LIKE THESE,
MY REAL ESTATE PHILOSOPHY

29:13.620 --> 29:15.321
IS TO TAKE THE BULL
BY THE HORNS.

29:15.355 --> 29:17.223
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

29:17.257 --> 29:19.159
- GOOD.
SO EVERYTHING'S SET TO GO.

29:19.192 --> 29:20.760
WE'RE READY TO PUT
THE APARTMENT ON THE MARKET,

29:20.794 --> 29:23.263
BUT YOU HAVE A LOT OF STUFF,
RIGHT?

29:23.296 --> 29:25.198
AND YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER,
IF WE WANT TO SELL,

29:25.231 --> 29:27.500
BUYERS HAVE NO IMAGINATION.

29:27.534 --> 29:32.505
SO...I'VE ENLISTED THE HELP
OF A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZER.

29:32.539 --> 29:34.808
- WHAT?
- ORGANIZER?

29:34.841 --> 29:36.710
- SURPRISE IS REALLY
MY ONLY OPTION HERE.

29:36.743 --> 29:39.446
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ADRIANA
ANY CHANCE TO SAY NO.

29:39.479 --> 29:41.214
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
ON THE LINE HERE,

29:41.247 --> 29:42.515
AND IF WE DON'T TAKE CARE
OF THIS PROBLEM,

29:42.549 --> 29:45.185
NO ONE IS GONNA BUY
THIS APARTMENT.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.786
I JUST CAME FROM DOWNSTAIRS.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.788
BARBARA'S DOWN THERE,
AND SHE HAS A TEAM OF MOVERS

29:48.822 --> 29:52.325
WITH A MOVING TRUCK.

29:52.359 --> 29:55.161
ADRIANA IS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
THAT'S REALLY HARD TO READ

29:55.195 --> 29:56.696
BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS SMILING.

29:56.730 --> 29:58.331
I MEAN, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHERE YOU STAND WITH HER.

29:58.365 --> 29:59.332
- YOU'RE MOVING EVERYTHING
TODAY?

29:59.366 --> 30:00.934
- YEAH, TODAY.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.069
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, 'CAUSE
WE NEED TO SELL THIS QUICKLY.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.805
- OKAY.
- YOU OKAY?

30:05.839 --> 30:07.540
- NO.
- EVERYBODY CALM DOWN.

30:07.574 --> 30:09.209
[knock on door]

30:09.242 --> 30:11.111
- HELLO.
- HI, BARBARA.

30:11.144 --> 30:13.780
- HELLO. HOW ARE YOU?
- ADRIANA. A PLEASURE.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.815
- MISS JAY, NICE TO KNOW YOU.
- HEY, BARBARA.

30:15.849 --> 30:19.119
SO NOW, I'VE TALKED
TO BARBARA ABOUT THE APARTMENT

30:19.152 --> 30:21.721
AND KIND OF GIVEN HER
A SLIGHT BREAKDOWN,

30:21.755 --> 30:22.922
BUT SHE HASN'T SEEN IT YET,

30:22.956 --> 30:24.424
SO WE'LL WALK THROUGH IT
TOGETHER.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.092
- GREAT.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.560
- ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BATHROOM.

30:27.594 --> 30:29.195
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

30:29.229 --> 30:30.730
- SO THIS NEEDS TO SHOW
AS A BATHROOM.

30:30.764 --> 30:31.965
- YEP.
- BUT WHAT IS IT SHOWING US?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.633
- IT SHOWS AS A SHOE CLOSET.

30:33.667 --> 30:36.069
- WHY SHOULD I MOVE THIS?
THIS IS PERFECTLY FINE.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.971
- BUT PEOPLE ARE JUST GONNA
COME IN AND SEE SHOES.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.372
THEY'RE NOT GONNA SEE--

30:39.406 --> 30:40.940
- BUT THEY'RE BEHIND A GLASS.
- THE SHOE COLLECTION.

30:40.974 --> 30:42.308
- THEY'RE BEHIND A GLASS.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.309
- I KNOW, BUT YOU CAN'T SEE
THE BATHTUB.

30:43.343 --> 30:45.145
- YOU DON'T NEED A BATHTUB.

30:45.178 --> 30:46.913
IF IT'S EMPTY,
IT LOOKS UGLIER.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.214
IT LOOKS PRETTIER LIKE THIS.

30:48.248 --> 30:51.418
- ADRIANA, THIS IS NOT PRETTY.
THIS IS NOT PRETTY.

30:51.451 --> 30:53.653
- EVEN THOUGH THERE AREN'T
PIZZA BOXES

30:53.687 --> 30:55.822
AND DEAD CATS EVERYWHERE,

30:55.855 --> 30:58.224
ADRIANA STILL,
KIND OF BY DEFINITION,

30:58.258 --> 30:59.492
IS A HOARDER.

30:59.526 --> 31:04.064
HER STUFF JUST HAPPENS TO BE
RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE.

31:04.064 --> 31:06.533
- WE'RE GONNA BACK UP OVER HERE.
- OH, MY GOSH.

31:10.537 --> 31:15.075
OH, MY GOSH.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

31:19.846 --> 31:24.684
- CRA--WOW.

31:24.718 --> 31:25.685
- COMING UP...
- OKAY, THIS?

31:25.719 --> 31:26.720
- NO, I WANT TO KEEP THAT.
- THIS?

31:26.753 --> 31:27.721
- OH, NO, NO.
- THESE ARE LONG-SLEEVE.

31:27.754 --> 31:28.988
- ADRIANA. ADRIANA.

31:29.089 --> 31:30.090
- HOLD ON. I'VE GOT TO
CHECK IT OUT FIRST.

31:30.090 --> 31:31.091
- IT'S LIKE RIPPING OFF
A BAND-AID.

31:31.091 --> 31:32.092
- SHH!

31:41.968 --> 31:43.403
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

31:44.504 --> 31:45.705
HI, TOM, HOW ARE YOU?

31:45.739 --> 31:47.807
I'M RELIEVED TO HEAR BACK
FROM TOM

31:47.841 --> 31:49.242
BECAUSE I KNOW HE HAD AN ISSUE

31:49.275 --> 31:51.411
WITH THE PRICE
OF JOHN'S APARTMENT.

31:51.444 --> 31:54.347
PLUS, JOHN DIDN'T REALLY
GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO CHARM HIM.

32:03.957 --> 32:09.229
- THAT'S 240,000 BELOW
THE INITIAL ASK.

32:09.262 --> 32:11.231
- RIGHT.

32:15.068 --> 32:16.770
- I'M GONNA SEE
WHAT I CAN DO.

32:16.803 --> 32:21.675
[line ringing]

32:21.708 --> 32:23.910
- HELLO.
- JOHN?

32:23.943 --> 32:25.578
- YEAH, HOW ARE YOU DOING,
FREDRIK?

32:25.612 --> 32:28.081
- AI-YI-YI.

32:28.081 --> 32:30.884
TOM PUT IN AN OFFER.

32:30.917 --> 32:31.918
YES.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.319
I'VE GOT TO GIVE YOU
THE OFFER.

32:33.353 --> 32:36.856
1,885,000.

32:36.890 --> 32:39.125
HE'S A REAL BUYER,
AND HE'S READY TO GO.

32:39.159 --> 32:42.162
IT'S JUST THE PRICE.

32:48.168 --> 32:50.704
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT
THE TRAFFIC THAT WE HAVE

32:50.737 --> 32:53.907
ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE UNITS
FROM THE DEVELOPER,

32:53.940 --> 32:56.109
AND AS YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PRETTY
NEGOTIABLE THERE.

32:56.109 --> 32:58.111
I MEAN, YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU
BOUGHT THE APARTMENT UPSTAIRS,

32:58.111 --> 33:00.280
AND I GOT YOU
A BIG DISCOUNT THERE.

33:12.392 --> 33:15.261
- OKAY, THINKING
WHAT I CAN DO,

33:15.295 --> 33:19.132
YOU KNOW, I CAN REALLY TRY
TO GET SOME MORE TRAFFIC.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.167
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU.

33:26.139 --> 33:27.974
- OKAY.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.076
WE'RE GOING TO SORT OF
LOOK AT YOUR THINGS

33:30.076 --> 33:31.678
AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE WEARING

33:31.711 --> 33:33.213
FOR THE NEXT, YOU KNOW,
SIX MONTHS.

33:33.246 --> 33:35.415
OKAY. THIS?

33:35.448 --> 33:36.416
- OKAY, NO.
I WANT TO KEEP THAT.

33:36.449 --> 33:37.450
- THIS?
- OH, NO, NO.

33:37.484 --> 33:38.518
WE NEED TO KEEP THAT.

33:38.551 --> 33:40.887
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
I WANT THIS.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.288
- FROM HERE TO HERE,
WE GET TO KEEP,

33:42.322 --> 33:43.390
SO WHATEVER YOU CAN FIT.

33:43.423 --> 33:44.557
- OH, WHATEVER I CAN FIT?

33:44.591 --> 33:46.793
- OKAY, SO THE--
- THIS IS STRESSFUL.

33:46.826 --> 33:47.961
I WANT THIS.

33:47.994 --> 33:49.796
- ADRIANA,
WE'RE GONNA BE HERE FOREVER

33:49.829 --> 33:51.097
IF WE GO PIECE BY PIECE.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.099
- WE'RE PUTTING THIS ON.
I'M WEARING IT ON.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.334
I DON'T CARE.
I HAVE TO KEEP THIS.

33:54.367 --> 33:55.335
OKAY, NO!
- THESE ARE LONG-SLEEVE.

33:55.368 --> 33:56.603
- ADRIANA. ADRIANA.

33:56.636 --> 33:57.671
- HOLD ON. I'VE GOT TO
CHECK IT OUT FIRST.

33:57.704 --> 33:58.672
- IT'S LIKE RIPPING OFF
A BAND-AID.

33:58.705 --> 33:59.806
- SHH!

33:59.839 --> 34:02.542
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

34:02.575 --> 34:04.277
- I'M TRYIN'.
I'M TRYIN', RYAN.

34:04.310 --> 34:06.346
- OH, MY GOD. YOU GUYS
ARE STRESSING ME OUT.

34:06.379 --> 34:07.814
- THIS IS NOT GOING WELL,

34:07.847 --> 34:09.416
SO I NEED TO GET THEM
BACK ON TRACK.

34:09.449 --> 34:11.951
OKAY, STAY CALM.
- RIGHT.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.319
- BREATHE.
- RIGHT.

34:13.353 --> 34:15.588
- AND REMEMBER, THERE'S A WAY
THAT YOU SELL YOUR HOME

34:15.622 --> 34:17.424
AND THEN THERE'S A WAY
THAT YOU LIVE IN YOUR HOME.

34:17.457 --> 34:19.059
WE'RE JUST GONNA MINIMIZE.

34:19.092 --> 34:20.527
- DEAL?

34:20.560 --> 34:22.262
- YOU'RE GIVING ME NO CHOICE.

34:22.295 --> 34:23.263
[laughter]

34:23.296 --> 34:24.831
YOU'RE FORCING ME.
- NO.

34:24.864 --> 34:25.865
- YES.
- IT'S NOT FORCING YOU.

34:25.899 --> 34:27.100
IT'S OUT OF LOVE.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.536
- YOU HAVE CARS DOWNSTAIRS.
THAT'S FORCE.

34:29.569 --> 34:32.305
- IF--IF A BUYER CAN CONNECT
WITH YOUR PLACE FASTER,

34:32.339 --> 34:33.640
YOU'RE GONNA SELL IT
FASTER.

34:33.673 --> 34:36.409
- ABSOLUTELY.

34:36.443 --> 34:37.877
OKAY?

34:37.911 --> 34:40.213
- OKAY, FINE.
- ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT?

34:41.681 --> 34:44.818
- ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO
IS SELL THE APARTMENT.

34:44.851 --> 34:45.885
THAT'S THE END GOAL.

34:45.919 --> 34:47.087
THIS STUFF IS GONNA BE
IN STORAGE.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.489
- OKAY, FINE.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.124
OKAY, I COULD DO
WITHOUT THOSE, I GUESS.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.292
- OKAY, GREAT.

34:52.325 --> 34:54.227
- OKAY, THOSE CAN GO.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.295
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

34:55.328 --> 34:56.596
PROGRESS.
LOOK AT THAT.

34:56.629 --> 34:59.299
OH, THAT WAS FOUR!

34:59.332 --> 35:01.735

BEFORE I HAVE A PANIC ATTACK.

35:01.768 --> 35:02.802

FOR DEAR LIFE?

35:11.177 --> 35:13.079
- YEAH.

35:14.814 --> 35:16.750
- WE'RE ACTUALLY STARTING TO
MAKE SOME PROGRESS HERE.

35:16.783 --> 35:17.884
I MEAN, THE APARTMENT

35:17.917 --> 35:20.220
IS NOW STARTING TO LOOK
LIKE AN ACTUAL HOME.

35:20.253 --> 35:21.888
LOOK, THERE'S A SHOWER HEAD
IN HERE!

35:21.921 --> 35:23.256
- VERY FUNNY.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.825
- I THINK IT'S TIME WE START
BRINGING SOME BUYERS IN.

35:25.859 --> 35:27.160
- YES!

35:27.193 --> 35:28.628
- I THINK YOU AND I SHOULD TALK
TO SOMEBODY.

35:28.661 --> 35:30.063
- NO.
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.

35:30.063 --> 35:33.099
WE'LL GO TO HOARDERS ANONYMOUS.
- NO. NO.

35:33.133 --> 35:34.434
- [laughs]

35:45.211 --> 35:47.981
- JOHN HAS ALREADY MOVED INTO
HIS NEW APARTMENT UPSTAIRS.

35:48.081 --> 35:49.149
I HAVEN'T SOLD THIS ONE.

35:49.182 --> 35:51.151
THE CLOCK IS TICKING.
THE PRESSURE IS ON.

35:51.184 --> 35:53.153
[knock on door]

35:53.186 --> 35:54.954
OH, HEY.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.290
BUT MY SECRET WEAPON--

35:57.323 --> 36:00.760
MY SWEDISH CHEF HAS ARRIVED,
AND I REALLY HOPE

36:00.794 --> 36:02.429
THAT HE CAN DISTRACT BROKERS
AWAY FROM THE FACT

36:02.462 --> 36:04.431
THERE'S NO FURNITURE
IN THE APARTMENT.

36:10.103 --> 36:12.439
I FEEL LIKE SINGING A BIT
OF A SWEDISH SONG

36:12.472 --> 36:13.573
WHILE WE DO THIS.

36:13.606 --> 36:16.343
DO YOU HAVE ANY GOOD
CHEF SONGS?

36:16.376 --> 36:17.477
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:17.510 --> 36:20.513
[both singing
in Swedish]

36:29.322 --> 36:31.057
- SEE, THE APARTMENT
ALREADY FEELS

36:31.091 --> 36:32.826
A LITTLE BIT MORE
LIKE A HOME.

36:36.663 --> 36:37.630
MMM.

36:37.664 --> 36:39.833
[doorbell rings]

36:39.866 --> 36:42.402
HI.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

36:42.435 --> 36:43.503
- HI, GIRLS, HOW ARE YOU?

36:50.377 --> 36:53.079
- WHERE TO, MIKE?
- UH, COLUMBUS CIRCLE.

36:55.281 --> 36:56.483
IT WAS GOOD.

36:56.516 --> 36:57.717
I ALWAYS SAY
ONE OF THE BEST PARTS

36:57.751 --> 36:58.852
ABOUT LIVING
IN NEW YORK CITY

36:58.885 --> 37:00.387
IS BEING ABLE TO LEAVE
THE CITY,

37:00.420 --> 37:01.688
ESPECIALLY ON THE WEEKENDS,

37:01.721 --> 37:04.024
WHEN I GET TO GO TO
ONE OF MY HOUSES IN BOSTON

37:04.024 --> 37:06.326
OR NANTUCKET OR EVEN
MY FAMILY'S HOUSE IN MIAMI.

37:06.359 --> 37:08.194
SOMETIMES IT'S REALLY NICE
TO GET OUT OF THE CITY.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.730
THIS TRAFFIC, I WANT TO PUNCH
PEOPLE IN THE FACE.

37:10.764 --> 37:11.765
- YOU WANT TO PUNCH 'EM?

37:11.798 --> 37:13.066
- WELL, I'D HAVE TO RUN AWAY.

37:13.099 --> 37:14.501
YOU COULD PUNCH PEOPLE
IN THE FACE AND STAND THERE.

37:14.534 --> 37:16.469
- [laughs] IT'S THE RED PANTS.

37:16.503 --> 37:18.505
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S THE RED PANTS.

37:18.538 --> 37:21.608
YOU REALLY, REALLY NEED TO--

37:21.641 --> 37:23.209
I'M SORRY, BROTHER, NO.

37:23.243 --> 37:24.577
- WITH AGE COMES KNOWLEDGE.

37:24.611 --> 37:26.479
- AND YOU KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT
REAL ESTATE THAN I DO,

37:26.513 --> 37:27.914
SO THERE YOU GO.

37:27.947 --> 37:30.250

I GOT KIMBERLY'S OFFER

37:57.644 --> 38:00.080
AND I WAITED TILL MONDAY

38:00.113 --> 38:02.082
I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WOULD
HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

38:02.115 --> 38:03.516
WOW, THAT SUCKS.

38:03.550 --> 38:06.453
THERE GOES MY FIRST BIG DEAL

38:27.741 --> 38:29.242
IT'S BEEN TWO HOURS.

38:29.275 --> 38:32.812
ALL THE WORK THAT MY TEAM
HAS PUT IN, AND TWO PEOPLE.

38:32.846 --> 38:34.748
TWO PEOPLE?

38:34.781 --> 38:37.584
NEW YORK CITY BROKERS,
WHERE ARE YOU?

38:37.617 --> 38:40.754
I NEED TO SELL THIS.
I HAVE A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME.

38:40.787 --> 38:41.955
[phone ringing]

38:42.055 --> 38:43.823
- [gasps]
THIS IS THE SELLER.

38:43.857 --> 38:47.327
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT SHOULD I TELL HIM?

38:47.360 --> 38:50.130
WELL, I HAVE TO TELL HIM
THE TRUTH.

38:50.163 --> 38:53.266
JOHN?

I'M GOOD.
I'M AT THE OPEN HOUSE.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.070

39:15.021 --> 39:17.357

39:48.355 --> 39:49.589

TWO DEALS,
DOUBLE COMMISSION.

39:53.626 --> 39:55.962
NOW IT'S TIME
TO DOUBLE CELEBRATE.

39:56.062 --> 39:57.931
WHEE!

39:57.964 --> 39:59.065

39:59.065 --> 40:00.066

40:00.100 --> 40:01.267

RIGHT.

40:01.301 --> 40:02.602
YOU'VE--YOU'VE LOST IT.

40:09.009 --> 40:11.778

SO IT'S 535 AND NOT 520?

40:11.811 --> 40:12.779

HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

40:21.654 --> 40:22.789
- I LOVE SURPRISES.

40:22.822 --> 40:24.257
IT'S NOT MY BIRTHDAY,
BY THE WAY.

40:24.290 --> 40:27.427
WHAT IS THIS?

40:27.460 --> 40:29.929
"RYAN, WHEN I SAW THIS,
I THOUGHT OF YOU.

40:29.963 --> 40:33.800
HAVE A NICE LIFE."

40:33.833 --> 40:37.604
- YOU GONNA OPEN IT?
- "HAVE A NICE LIFE"?

40:37.637 --> 40:38.738
THAT'S KIND OF MEAN.

40:38.772 --> 40:40.140
- OH, MY GOD!

I DON'T LIKE THE SNAKE.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.811
OH, MY GOD. OH!

40:44.844 --> 40:49.082
- WOW. THAT IS A SNAKE.

40:49.115 --> 40:51.384
WHO DROPPED THIS OFF?
- I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

40:51.418 --> 40:53.853
- "WHEN I SAW THIS,
I THOUGHT OF YOU." WOW.

41:06.232 --> 41:08.101

- UM, SO I PUT THE OFFER IN
AND UNBEKNOWNST TO ME,

41:23.683 --> 41:26.319
SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN PLAYING
AROUND WITH IT FOR A LITTLE BIT,

41:26.353 --> 41:28.755
THEY ACTUALLY WENT
TO CONTRACT THAT MORNING.

41:28.788 --> 41:32.792

- WELL, IT'S GONE TO CONTRACT.
RIGHT.

41:37.430 --> 41:42.235
YOU'VE--YOU'VE LOST IT.
- AND I LOST IT BECAUSE?

41:42.268 --> 41:45.238
- YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST
A MATTER OF THE TIMING.

41:45.271 --> 41:46.940
BUT, I MEAN, IT HAPPENS
A LOT, UNFORTUNATELY.

41:46.973 --> 41:48.241

MY CALLS RETURNED

41:51.578 --> 41:53.279
OR I GET IN TOUCH
WITH SOMEBODY,

41:53.313 --> 41:54.414
SOMETIMES YOU LOSE A DEAL.

41:54.447 --> 41:55.749
- SO WE JUST WEREN'T
FAST ENOUGH.

41:55.782 --> 41:57.384
- CORRECT.

41:57.417 --> 41:59.452
I MEAN, IF WE HAD
24 HOURS PRIOR,

41:59.486 --> 42:01.855
WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE GOT IT,
BUT THEN, HEY, WE COULD HAVE--

42:01.888 --> 42:04.057
MAYBE THERE WOULD HAVE--THERE
COULD HAVE BEEN A BIDDING WAR.

42:04.057 --> 42:08.061
- MICHAEL, YOU KNEW THAT
THERE WAS ANOTHER PERSON?

42:08.061 --> 42:10.497
- I KNEW PEOPLE
HAD BEEN LOOKING AT IT.

42:10.530 --> 42:11.965
I'M SITTING HERE,
THINKING TO MYSELF,

42:12.065 --> 42:14.167
WOW, SHE REALLY WANTED THIS.

42:14.200 --> 42:15.468
I FEEL BAD.

42:15.502 --> 42:17.103
YOU KNOW, WAS THERE SOMETHING
I COULD HAVE DONE?

42:17.137 --> 42:19.339
SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO
GET HER IN THERE EARLIER?

42:19.372 --> 42:20.507
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT PSYCHIC.

42:20.540 --> 42:22.075
I DIDN'T KNOW
SHE'D LOVE IT THAT MUCH.

42:22.108 --> 42:23.777
- SO BASICALLY,
I'M HOMELESS.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.918
- WELL, I APPRECIATE YOU

42:31.951 --> 42:33.820
AND YOU DID A GREAT JOB
WITH THE APARTMENT.

I APPRECIATE YOU AND THE BOAT
AND THE APARTMENT,

42:37.090 --> 42:38.124
EVERYTHING.

42:38.158 --> 42:39.592
- YOU ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.

42:39.626 --> 42:42.595
- WELL, IT WAS CLOSE.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

42:42.629 --> 42:44.164
I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS.

42:44.197 --> 42:45.765
I'M SO GLAD AND PROUD

42:45.799 --> 42:47.567
THAT I DID SELL THOSE TWO
APARTMENTS TO HIM,

42:47.600 --> 42:51.104
BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE PUSHED ME
OFF THE BOAT OTHERWISE.
