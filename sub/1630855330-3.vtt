-Copy, Dispatch.

28:20.873 --> 28:23.223
All right, we're gonna
let you go with a warning.

28:23.266 --> 28:24.703
This time.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.574
Drive more carefully
in the future.

28:26.617 --> 28:30.099
What the hell was that?

28:30.143 --> 28:32.798
I have no idea.

28:32.841 --> 28:35.278
[engines start]

28:35.322 --> 28:37.846
Uh, thanks.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.195
Yeah, no problem.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.067
Sera.

28:41.110 --> 28:44.026
Va-Vanessa.

28:45.375 --> 28:48.074
Jim.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.990
You know I'm not
a civil rights attorney.

28:51.033 --> 28:52.295
Totally.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.342
Then why did you...

28:55.385 --> 28:57.126
'Cause you were
following the van.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.824
Without a lot of discretion,
for what it's worth.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.216
Discretion is his middle name.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.870
Wait, you were
following them, too?

29:01.914 --> 29:03.480
Well, if you hadn't
let them get away,

29:03.524 --> 29:04.699
we could have found out
where they were taking

29:04.743 --> 29:06.657
the evidence from the bombing.

29:07.658 --> 29:10.357
Okay, look, I'm used to
doing this on my own,

29:10.400 --> 29:12.663
but if you have notes
that we can compare...

29:12.707 --> 29:14.535
You know who
blew up the bridge?

29:14.578 --> 29:16.711
Well, I can make
an educated guess.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.453
I mean, it was destroyed,
obviously not randomly,

29:19.496 --> 29:20.759
because of what it symbolized.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.415
International cooperation,
the world getting smaller,

29:25.459 --> 29:27.156
humanity working together.

29:27.200 --> 29:28.636
They'll blame it
on a terrorist attack

29:28.679 --> 29:30.072
and we'll go back to
fighting each other

29:30.116 --> 29:32.509
instead of the real threat.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.816
You mean...

29:36.862 --> 29:38.037
Aliens.

29:43.607 --> 29:45.784
Anyway, uh,
it was super fun

29:45.827 --> 29:48.177
saving you from an illegal
black site torture dungeon.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.657
I got to go.

29:49.700 --> 29:53.095
My-my wife was abducted.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.446
Taken aboard an alien ship.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.971
She saw things.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.756
Uh, yes,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.323
I-I'm his...

30:04.803 --> 30:07.240
I did.
[clears throat]

30:07.283 --> 30:10.025
It was terrifying,
the-the things I saw.

30:10.069 --> 30:12.811
Well, like, what did you see?

30:12.854 --> 30:16.727
Advanced technology far beyond
anything humans possess.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.729
What kind of technology?

30:18.773 --> 30:20.340
Something called
a photonic bomb.

30:20.383 --> 30:21.820
That's what blew up
the bridge.

30:23.386 --> 30:25.388
Have you heard of anything
like that?

30:27.564 --> 30:29.044
A lot of crazies
latch onto this stuff.

30:29.088 --> 30:30.089
They're looking for
something to believe in

30:30.132 --> 30:31.612
outside the mainstream,

30:31.655 --> 30:34.049
trying to find the seams
in the bunny suit.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.921
Right.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.140
Well, things have been changing.
You have to have noticed. Right?

30:38.184 --> 30:40.012
I mean, there's more attacks
and they're closer together.

30:40.055 --> 30:43.276
Usually the government is better
at covering them up.

30:43.319 --> 30:46.801
To be clear, we're talking about
the government of...

30:46.845 --> 30:49.108
No, no, no, it's an
international cabal.

30:49.151 --> 30:51.023
It's the only thing all of
the governments in the world

30:51.066 --> 30:52.589
can agree on.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.940
Keeping the alien attacks secret
in exchange for

30:54.983 --> 30:56.680
any advanced tech
that they recover.

30:56.724 --> 30:58.160
I mean, they have
a facility here

30:58.204 --> 30:59.945
where they work on it.

30:59.988 --> 31:02.730
Experimental aircraft,
quantum computers.

31:02.773 --> 31:06.473
I heard that they even have
a cold fusion reactor

31:06.516 --> 31:08.301
here in the city

31:08.344 --> 31:10.303
that powers
their entire operation.

31:12.696 --> 31:14.481
The bridge was about
sowing division.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.309
What about the other attacks?
What was the connection?

31:16.352 --> 31:19.921
Okay, so Chernobyl,
Tunguska, JFK,

31:19.965 --> 31:22.619
random gas leak explosions--

31:22.663 --> 31:25.231
all of it is about

31:25.274 --> 31:27.929
slowing down human progress.

31:27.973 --> 31:29.931
Keeping us stuck on this rock

31:29.975 --> 31:31.977
so we never go to space.

31:33.630 --> 31:36.982
Are you guys hungry?
'Cause I'm hungry.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.159
I am hungry, actually.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.291
Wait, I...

31:45.164 --> 31:47.253
KIRK:
Wait, poutine has gravy?

31:47.296 --> 31:50.691
-This is amazing.
-Can you focus?

31:50.734 --> 31:53.259
I'm not sure we can believe
anything she's telling us.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.565
She knew enough
to follow the van

31:55.609 --> 31:56.871
from the bridge explosion.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.394
She's unhinged.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.875
She grew up in a time
when everyone thought

32:00.919 --> 32:02.659
aliens were science fiction.

32:02.703 --> 32:05.184
But in her gut
she knows that they're real,

32:05.227 --> 32:07.577
and that they aren't
necessarily friendly.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.492
I mean, that would make anyone
unhinged, right?

32:09.536 --> 32:13.018
Hey, sorry.
This works better with visuals.

32:13.061 --> 32:16.195
I have spent years
collecting these pictures.

32:16.238 --> 32:17.848
I mean, there's plenty available
on the Internet,

32:17.892 --> 32:20.721
but 99% of it is nonsense
and memes, right?

32:20.764 --> 32:22.723
-[whispers]: What's a meme?
-I don't know.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.464
SERA:
Sorry these are so blurry.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.335
I swear, half of these people
on forums

32:26.379 --> 32:28.468
are still using dial-up.

32:30.209 --> 32:31.514
KIRK:
How did you get this?

32:31.558 --> 32:32.863
An astronomer
trying to take a picture

32:32.907 --> 32:34.691
of the International
Space Station.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.606
In the right place
at the right time.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.914
And speaking of--
there's a hookah place

32:39.958 --> 32:41.829
across from
the bridge explosion site.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.527
I bought the surveillance
footage off the owner

32:44.571 --> 32:46.834
before the police could
confiscate it, and...

32:46.877 --> 32:49.750
he was waiting 15 minutes
before the explosion.

32:49.793 --> 32:52.883
And that's one of the guys
who made off with the wreckage.

32:52.927 --> 32:55.321
Like he already knew
it was going to happen.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.375
Well, I'm sorry we didn't
have more to tell you.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.422
We're, uh, we're new at this.

33:09.465 --> 33:11.815
No, I mean, you-you listened.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.514
You didn't tell me
that I was crazy.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.472
You have no idea
what that means to me.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.650
Anyway, uh, thank you.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.829
You have to feel bad for her.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.136
To be so certain of something,
so close to the proof.

33:28.180 --> 33:30.095
Well, she's closer
than she thinks.

33:31.096 --> 33:32.184
That ship she showed us--

33:32.227 --> 33:35.056
it's Romulan.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.841
I remember now.

33:37.885 --> 33:40.018
Look, she said that
there's an experimental

33:40.061 --> 33:43.064
cold fusion reactor
somewhere in the city.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.458
Well, I know that there is
because in a few days

33:45.501 --> 33:48.417
it's gonna be destroyed
and wipe out Toronto.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.071
A Romulan first strike.

33:50.115 --> 33:53.161
None of that happens
in my timeline.

33:53.205 --> 33:55.859
Then we need to find
the cold fusion reactor first.

33:55.903 --> 33:59.167
Stop the time traveler
from destroying it.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.347
Which would be trivial
if we had a tricorder.

34:06.870 --> 34:08.263
Yeah.

34:08.306 --> 34:11.484
If only someone
hadn't impulsively

34:11.527 --> 34:13.659
zapped us over here
without one.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.835
Any chance that same someone

34:15.879 --> 34:17.793
took a lot of engineering
extension courses

34:17.838 --> 34:19.013
at the Academy?

34:19.056 --> 34:21.059
Maybe she can build one for us?

34:21.101 --> 34:23.800
Someone had to audit
the intro course, so...

34:23.844 --> 34:27.065
Mm. So I guess we just
need to find an engineer

34:27.108 --> 34:28.849
from the stone ages

34:28.891 --> 34:31.199
-to build us
a cold fusion detector.
-Yeah.

34:31.243 --> 34:34.681
Ideally one who's not gonna ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.161
[reporter speaking indistinctly]

And besides, people don't just
wander in off the street

36:16.391 --> 36:18.219
saying, "I know your secret."

36:18.263 --> 36:22.005
To get a free pass from me
I need more to go on than that.

36:22.049 --> 36:24.225
How else would I know
that you're a Lanthanite,

36:24.269 --> 36:27.489
an ancient sect of beings
who live impossibly long lives,

36:27.533 --> 36:29.535
who've hidden amongst humans
largely undetected

36:29.578 --> 36:30.971
for thousands of years?

36:31.014 --> 36:34.366
How else could I know that
you stole that

36:34.409 --> 36:35.715
from the Louvre?

36:35.758 --> 36:37.630
How did you find me?

36:37.673 --> 36:39.414
I knew you were
at a place called

36:39.458 --> 36:41.024
The Archaeology Department.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.157
But I thought it was
an actual, well, you know,

36:43.201 --> 36:44.724
archaeology department.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.856
So, then we checked out
a lot of universities.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.380
And when that didn't work,

36:48.423 --> 36:49.903
a guy at the Apple Store
taught me

36:49.946 --> 36:52.079
how to use DuckDuckGo.

36:52.122 --> 36:55.082
None of that answers
how you know about me

36:55.125 --> 36:56.344
in the first place.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.346
I don't exactly advertise.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.609
We have something in common.

37:00.653 --> 37:03.133
We both have secrets
that would topple

37:03.177 --> 37:05.005
a lot of people's
firmly-held beliefs.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.226
Uh, all I can say is...

37:09.270 --> 37:12.273
...my friend and I--

37:12.317 --> 37:15.233
we're on a mission
to protect something...

...beautiful.

37:20.586 --> 37:22.718
The future of humanity.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.505
And I think you know
from experience

37:26.548 --> 37:28.202
just how fragile that future is.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.248
We are maybe hours away

37:30.291 --> 37:32.467
from losing
that future entirely.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.339
You are the only person

I can trust to help us.

37:38.038 --> 37:40.475
We both have brain-melting
secrets is, I guess,

37:40.519 --> 37:43.435
a good enough reason
to help someone.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.002
What you need?

37:46.046 --> 37:48.440
An engineer.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.093
Well, then,

37:50.137 --> 37:52.661
why the hell did you come to me?

37:54.141 --> 37:56.796
You're not an engineer?

37:56.839 --> 37:59.059
I work retail.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.756
D-Does this look like

38:00.800 --> 38:03.759
an engineer's
e-engineering place?

38:03.803 --> 38:06.762
I haven't taken a math class

38:06.806 --> 38:09.852
since Pythagoras
made the crap up.

38:11.027 --> 38:14.683
You two are trying to find
a nuclear reactor?

38:14.727 --> 38:16.685
Why is that?

38:16.729 --> 38:20.167
I-I've had enough bad run-ins
with law enforcement

38:20.210 --> 38:22.648
to last several lifetimes.

38:22.691 --> 38:25.259
And now, this business
with the bridge.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.480
We're the ones trying
to not blow up the reactor.

38:28.523 --> 38:32.266
I guess it doesn't matter much.
I like a good puzzle,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.355
but I don't know
what help I can be.

38:34.399 --> 38:37.576
I'm the one that thought
cold fusion was pretend,

38:37.619 --> 38:40.187
like Bigfoot or lasers.

38:40.230 --> 38:42.363
Lasers

38:42.407 --> 38:44.365
are also real.

38:44.409 --> 38:47.325
All right, you know,
I can't keep up

38:47.368 --> 38:49.936
with every scientific whatever.

38:49.979 --> 38:52.634
-You let this lady
repair my ship?
-Okay, what?!

38:52.678 --> 38:55.637
We don't have to understand
how cold fusion works

38:55.681 --> 38:58.205
to find the reactor, we just
need to find its byproducts.

38:58.248 --> 39:02.078
Excess heat, neutrons, tritium.

39:02.122 --> 39:04.733
Tritium, like in
divers' watches.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.561
Old divers' watches
from the '80s.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.390

Follow me.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.480

39:19.269 --> 39:21.054
Or-or they used to.
Something about

39:21.097 --> 39:24.710

Tritium gives off

Maybe, um, phosphor?

39:35.634 --> 39:38.201
Tritium has a short half-life,

and now I have.

55:12.004 --> 55:13.048
Excuse me.

55:15.312 --> 55:17.139
[door whooshes open]

55:35.854 --> 55:38.900
La'An Noonien-Singh.
I'm Agent Ymalay

55:38.944 --> 55:41.294
from the Department
of Temporal Investigations.

55:41.338 --> 55:42.774
Am I meant to know
what that is?

55:42.817 --> 55:44.515
A division of the Federation

55:44.558 --> 55:47.213
that investigates and repairs
damage to the timeline.

55:47.256 --> 55:49.607
You haven't heard of us
because we don't exist yet.

55:51.565 --> 55:54.220
The man who gave me this.

55:54.263 --> 55:57.049
Was one of us.

55:57.092 --> 55:59.660
Thank you again
for completing his mission.

55:59.704 --> 56:03.142
It must have been harrowing.

56:03.185 --> 56:04.970
I have to insist
that you not share

56:05.013 --> 56:06.754
any of what you experienced,

56:06.798 --> 56:09.670
even with Captain Pike,

56:09.714 --> 56:12.194
or anyone else from this time.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.154
You sent me back

56:15.197 --> 56:18.331
to protect a mass murderer?

56:18.375 --> 56:21.813
To be clear,
I didn't send you anywhere.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.989
I had to kill to protect him.

56:24.032 --> 56:26.078
I had to watch my f...

56:29.603 --> 56:31.344
And I can't even talk about it?

56:31.388 --> 56:33.433
Those events were never
supposed to happen

56:33.477 --> 56:36.480
and you were never meant
to be aware of them.

56:36.523 --> 56:38.482
Neither was your companion.

56:38.525 --> 56:40.788
You protected the timeline

56:40.832 --> 56:44.009
in a way no one else could have.

56:44.052 --> 56:45.750
Would you risk

56:45.793 --> 56:48.535
undoing all of that?

56:53.801 --> 56:56.500
No.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.724
Thank you again
for your assistance.

57:03.768 --> 57:06.161
And, if you could...

57:08.250 --> 57:11.340
...return our equipment.

[line ringing]

58:13.185 --> 58:15.143
This is Lieutenant Kirk.

58:15.187 --> 58:17.232
Uh, hi.

58:17.276 --> 58:19.496
Do I know you?

58:19.539 --> 58:21.454
No, we-we've never met.

I am...

Oh, God. What did Sam do?

Oh, no, no, Sam... Sorry.
Sam-Sam's fine.

58:30.637 --> 58:33.161
Sorry to worry you. Um...

58:33.205 --> 58:36.077
I-I was just
looking for, um, a...

58:36.121 --> 58:37.470
something for his file.

58:37.514 --> 58:40.168
-Uh...
-His security file?

58:40.212 --> 58:43.258
That's right. Uh, just a place
of birth, please.

58:43.302 --> 58:45.696
Riverside, Iowa.
Same as me.

58:45.739 --> 58:49.395
Iowa on Earth?

58:49.438 --> 58:52.398
Um...

58:52.441 --> 58:55.401
Iowa on Earth.
[soft chuckle] Yes, ma'am.

58:57.969 --> 59:00.275
Is that really
why you're calling?

59:00.319 --> 59:02.713
That's it. I'm just, um,

59:02.756 --> 59:05.890
a stickler for, uh, an orderly
security record, so...

59:05.933 --> 59:08.066
Well, if you want the, uh,

59:08.109 --> 59:10.634
the real dirt
on George Samuel Kirk,

59:10.677 --> 59:13.811
buy me a drink next time
we're on starbase together.

59:13.854 --> 59:16.640
I got some real gems
for his permanent file.

59:16.683 --> 59:18.859
That, uh, sounds lovely.

59:18.903 --> 59:20.992
