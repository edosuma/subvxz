02:24.394 --> 02:25.562
Hey!

02:25.562 --> 02:26.772
Baby killer!

02:33.570 --> 02:36.448
Well, they picked the grand jury,
so I'm gonna send Yanko--

02:37.658 --> 02:38.659
Holy shit.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.331
- Are you okay?
- I guess my post hit a nerve.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.712
And I really liked this coat.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.725
Five minutes, Alex.

03:03.725 --> 03:04.810
Thanks.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.230
Oh, God.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.315
<i>This week on</i> Alex Unfiltered<i>...</i>

03:10.315 --> 03:14.319
<i>Big Data, fake news
and the truth about his top-secret tech.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:18.991
<i>Nothing's off the table as Hyperion CEO
Paul Marks talks with Alex Levy</i>

03:18.991 --> 03:21.326
<i>about taking UBA into the future.</i>

03:22.202 --> 03:26.623
<i>Join us for this exclusive interview,
Thursday at 8:00, only on UBA+.</i>

03:26.623 --> 03:28.625
I bet nothing's off the table.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.503
I'm more interested
in what's happening under the table.

03:31.503 --> 03:34.089
Do you think they were sleeping together
when they shot this?

03:34.089 --> 03:36.008
I can't believe after Mitch,
she's still pulling this shit.

03:36.008 --> 03:38.177
Okay, I don't think
it's exactly the same thing.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.554
- Did you see the picture?
- No.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.514
It's embarrassing.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.850
She's turning us into a joke.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.393
Hey, I've got a joke.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.729
How many narcissists does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

03:48.729 --> 03:49.897
How many?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.982
Just one,
but they need the whole world watching.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.317
Really, Joel?

03:55.819 --> 03:56.820
Sorry.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.449
All right. You guys, listen up.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.368
I just have to say

04:03.952 --> 04:06.788
that no matter what goes on
in my personal life,

04:06.788 --> 04:09.291
nothing here in our day-to-day
at <i>TMS</i> is gonna change.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.836
So we don't have time
for bullshit or gossip.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.714
- This SCOTUS story is too important.
- Agreed.

04:16.714 --> 04:20.594
We had a great show today,
but we have to bring it all week.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.388
Let's get to it.
Who's got copies of the draft opinion?

04:23.388 --> 04:26.767
Does anybody have any info on the leaker?
Are they all just pointing fingers?

04:26.767 --> 04:29.102
- What's happening?
- I can make copies. I'll do that.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.438
Yeah, that'd be a better use
of your time, Joel.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.692
I want Kirsten Gillibrand
on <i>Alex Unfiltered</i>.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.695
They're only gonna give us five minutes
and asked to be on <i>TMS</i>.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.780
They did?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.950
And they will only give us five minutes?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.786
- Honestly. Chip?
- Yeah, I'll look into it. Yeah.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.538
Any word from Anita Hill?

04:47.538 --> 04:49.957
I reached out again this morning,
but it's still early, so...

04:50.541 --> 04:51.750
All right. Well, call again.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.085
- I'll call too.
- Absolutely.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.670
Look, we're going all in on this, okay?

04:54.670 --> 04:58.507
Hey, before you go,
everyone's still good for Thursday, right?

04:59.675 --> 05:01.051
We'll meet in the teacup?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.889
Great. Okay, guys, back to work. Let's go.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.063
And how is she doing?

05:13.063 --> 05:16.316
We told her to take the day,
just go home, but you know Chris.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.904
So, do you think this is a one-off thing,
or is this gonna be a problem?

05:20.904 --> 05:23.240
Not sure yet. I'll keep an eye on it.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.493
- Did Alex talk to you since last night?
- No.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.453
- What about Paul?
- He's in Texas right now.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.581
He's coming back on Thursday
for the photo shoot.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.583
Yeah, he's making moves.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.251
Yeah. Seems like everybody is.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.090
Were you ever gonna tell me
that you're the Stanford student?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.218
Would you have done anything differently?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.345
You know that's why he offered you my job.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.015
He was worried that you're a problem.

05:49.433 --> 05:50.809
And so he took care of it.

05:58.609 --> 06:02.821
I think something's going on at Hyperion,
something that Paul wants to keep quiet.

06:03.572 --> 06:05.490
Can you be more specific?

06:07.075 --> 06:09.286
- No.
- Okay.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.957
If Paul wants to sleep with Alex,
so be it.

06:13.957 --> 06:19.379
If he wants to sell their nudes as NFTs,
as long as she consents, I don't care.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.299
His stunts don't matter.
His moves don't matter.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.885
His money matters.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.305
So we are going to close this deal,
no matter what,

06:28.305 --> 06:31.016
and UBA's future is going to be secure.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.477
And I got a $150 million buyout,

06:33.477 --> 06:35.896
so I judge it as too expensive to fire me.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.690
- Is there anything else?
- No.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.120
<i>Hi. You've reached Kate. Leave a message.</i>

06:53.622 --> 06:54.957
Shit.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.835
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.587
Just checking
on this employment agreement.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.214
Yeah. Looks good.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.466
My agents are gonna
get back to you shortly.

07:06.218 --> 07:10.013
Great. Wanna get the team in place
before the shareholder vote.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.810
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Of course.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.481
I left a message for the head of legal
at Planned Parenthood,

07:19.481 --> 07:21.859
- Linda-- Right. Okay.
- Constantine. Yeah, I'll follow up.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.152
Also, Anita Hill's office
finally reached out.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.070
Good.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.114
They said check back with them
in, like, two weeks.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.033
Two weeks?

07:30.033 --> 07:34.413
Look, before you say anything,
I made some calls, and...

07:36.540 --> 07:38.792
Anita Hill's doing an in-depth
with Laura Peterson.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.211
You have got to be kidding me.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.214
It's NBN. The producers are playing dirty,
and I'm just not getting through.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.301
Yeah, well, that's not good enough.
This is your job, Chip.

07:49.553 --> 07:52.472
If NBN is trying to convince people
not to touch me,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.308
it is your job to un-convince them.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.476
I get it, Alex. But I just--

07:57.644 --> 07:58.812
Is that gonna be a problem?

08:00.939 --> 08:02.858
- No.
- Great.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.235
- I will handle it.
- Thank you.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.948
Look, I wanted to ask you--

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
You didn't respond to Doug's email.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.662
- I was cc'd on it.
- I know. Fucking Doug.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.624
Did you read the statement he drafted?
I thought it was pretty straightforward.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.958
- I mean--
- It's not happening.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.836
I am not putting out a statement
about Paul this week.

08:23.629 --> 08:26.256
I get it, Alex. It sucks, okay?

08:26.256 --> 08:29.384
But this is Paul Marks.
It's not some rando from Raya.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.095
We're closing the deal next week, okay?

08:32.095 --> 08:34.264
This is a story
you have to get ahead of. You know this.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.433
Chip, this is what they do.
This is what they do.

08:38.059 --> 08:42.272
No. I cannot be the story
that distracts from the actual news.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.691
All right? I will deal with Doug.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.527
You just handle Linda Constantine, okay?

08:46.527 --> 08:48.362
Yeah. All right, I'm on it.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.446
Thank you.

08:53.325 --> 08:54.993
Oh, God. What the fuck?

08:56.078 --> 08:58.121
NBN just has better bagels than we do.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.624
They're not from work.
I picked them up on the way.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.209
That's so sweet.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.669
You thought I was just standing there,

09:03.669 --> 09:05.379
all mic'ed up,
shoving cream cheese in my bag?

09:05.379 --> 09:08.841
That's what I do every day.
I get all my best snacks at work.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.636
I actually had to duck out
right after we wrapped.

09:13.470 --> 09:17.808
The world's on fire, and all Audra
can talk about is Alex and Paul.

09:17.808 --> 09:19.184
I mean, I agree.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.727
Alex is really crossing a line.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.189
Look, I want her to be happy,
but I don't even know what to say to her.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.276
You know, he was sniffing around us too.
I mean, God knows we need the money.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.695
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.240
Well, maybe you'll come work at UBA again,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.826
and you can get a little office
next to mine,

09:35.826 --> 09:37.786
and we can make out in the supply closet.

09:38.287 --> 09:39.663
That sounds perfect.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.460
- Okay, I have to go to work.
- Okay.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.087
As much as I'd like to eat bagels.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.630
Where is my robe?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.550
- I don't know how you function.
- I know. I gotta get a closet.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.886
- I don't know, something like that.
- What's this?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.471
Cory's mom gave me that.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.932
When were you with Cory's mom?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.642
Yesterday. It was a work thing.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.519
Honestly, it was very weird.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.229
Yeah.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.149
My boss has never introduced me
to her mom.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.734
Count your blessings.

10:11.403 --> 10:14.239
You were amazing this morning.
Highest-rated Tuesday in two months.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.949
I didn't love the face full of paint,

10:15.949 --> 10:18.243
but it's not gonna stop me
from going on air.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.538
About that.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.001
We need to talk to you
about your segments going forward, Chris.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.546
Now that I'm a walking, talking
political liability.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.634
We may need to pull back
on your SCOTUS coverage.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.511
Just for the next couple of weeks.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.888
I'm sorry, you're doing what?

10:37.888 --> 10:40.182
Layla, I thought we said
we were gonna slow-walk this one.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.267
There's slow-walking,
and then there's sugarcoating.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.729
And it might be good to lay off
your socials until this dies down.

10:45.729 --> 10:49.650
So I say
what the majority of people are thinking,

10:49.650 --> 10:52.486
- and you're punishing me for it?
- No, we're not punishing you.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.948
We can't guarantee your safety.
Your physical safety.

10:55.948 --> 10:59.660
While you were on air today,
there were some additional threats.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.247
- Okay.
- Right.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.832
There's someone we'd like you to meet.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.000
Preston?

11:07.918 --> 11:08.836
Hey, Preston.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.671
Preston's gonna be looking after you.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.340
Pick you up, take you door-to-door,
anything else you need.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.842
Nice to meet you.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.301
You know I already have a driver.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.596
Preston will be escorting you
from the lobby to your car,

11:19.596 --> 11:20.931
from the car into your home.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.891
Until all this blows over.

11:25.978 --> 11:27.271
You gotta be kidding me.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.733
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.153
- Am I interrupting?
- No, not at all. Come on in.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.448
Have a seat.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.413
I have an old friend who works for Paul.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.331
Used to.

11:46.331 --> 11:49.710
She just got fired, but I don't think
it's because she fucked up.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.629
- Okay.
- She came to see me,

11:52.629 --> 11:55.924
and I think she was trying to tell me
something about his company.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.551
And I didn't--

12:00.304 --> 12:01.388
I shut her down.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.432
And now she won't return my calls.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.519
Wait, do you think
she wants to be a whistleblower?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.479
I don't know. But I need you to find out.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.232
Okay.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.776
And for obvious reasons, I can't ask Alex.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.445
Yeah. Of course.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.113
She might talk to you.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.575
You have a certain profile.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.954
You're not afraid
to take down powerful men.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.794
Look, Kate was my best friend.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.674
And when I saw her--
I don't know what's going on.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.343
- She seemed fragile and manic...
- Okay.

12:39.343 --> 12:41.803
- ...and desperate--
- Yeah. I hear you, Stella. I know. Okay.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.514
I hear your concerns.

12:45.641 --> 12:50.020
I'm just worried because the last time
I pushed a woman to talk about her trauma,

12:50.979 --> 12:52.105
she ended her life.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.527
Hannah Schoenfeld didn't kill herself
because of you.

12:56.527 --> 12:59.780
Well, I can't do that.

13:01.365 --> 13:02.366
Not again.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.369
What happened to Hannah was terrible.

13:06.537 --> 13:07.538
Period.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.500
But in the end, you did the right thing.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.878
You held those men accountable.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.383
Call Kate. Please.

13:38.652 --> 13:40.320
- Hey.
- <i>Stella's on board.</i>

13:40.320 --> 13:41.405
<i>I'll chase the paperwork.</i>

13:42.072 --> 13:44.867
- <i>Good.</i>
- Now all we need is a long-range rocket

13:44.867 --> 13:46.285
that goes where we tell it to.

13:46.285 --> 13:48.704
Well, if this test goes well,
we're on our way.

13:50.831 --> 13:52.124
How much shit is Alex taking?

13:52.124 --> 13:53.876
<i>Hey, I came on board with you</i>

13:53.876 --> 13:57.838
because I want to do something
bigger than myself, bigger than humanity.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.008
"The world is too fucking small."
That's what you said.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.260
<i>You want to get your bird wet? Fine.</i>

14:03.260 --> 14:05.846
<i>But when you lose focus,
the mission suffers.</i>

14:05.846 --> 14:07.806
Well, I think my focus is just fine.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.683
Good. I was beginning to worry.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.227
You've been smiling a lot.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.770
<i>It unnerves me.</i>

14:13.770 --> 14:16.440
You take care of your end,
I'll take care of mine.

14:23.572 --> 14:27.201
So, when I finally went home,
my wife had left.

14:28.493 --> 14:34.791
She had taken everything that was hers,
and the house was blank.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.339
I don't even know how long
she'd been gone. It could have been weeks.

14:43.592 --> 14:46.345
<i>I had to take a pretty hard look
at myself.</i>

14:48.722 --> 14:53.435
<i>The way I treated other people.
The cost... of what I was doing.</i>

14:56.188 --> 14:58.315
There. Pause it there. Right there. Sorry.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.399
What?

15:00.234 --> 15:02.903
Nothing. I was just thinking how great
it'll be for the grandchildren,

15:02.903 --> 15:05.614
having the moment
that they fell in love on tape.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.743
Cory, you're very funny,
but what the hell am I supposed to do?

15:09.743 --> 15:12.371
You wanna pull the reaction shot?

15:12.371 --> 15:13.830
Turn Alex into a robot?

15:13.830 --> 15:15.832
Come on. Everybody's gonna know
we fucked with the edit.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.835
Well, they'll know someone fucked.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.298
You know, Alex should be here.
She has final cut.

15:23.298 --> 15:24.925
Okay. Yeah, I'll talk to her.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.844
Just please remember that you and me

15:26.844 --> 15:31.265
and every other warm-blooded Alex Levy fan
watching this interview knows

15:31.265 --> 15:32.683
that they end up in bed together.

15:33.433 --> 15:37.688
You cut that casting couch dig
and the abandoned husband routine,

15:37.688 --> 15:41.650
and we have ratings gold.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.195
It's true, Chip. You know that.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.366
Asshole.

16:12.181 --> 16:13.182
<i>Hello?</i>

16:13.182 --> 16:15.601
Hey, is this Kate Danton?

16:16.852 --> 16:17.853
<i>Who is this?</i>

16:17.853 --> 16:21.190
This is Bradley Jackson
from <i>UBA Evening News</i>.

16:21.190 --> 16:24.026
I'm wondering if you'd want
to talk about Paul Marks.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.110
<i>Wrong number.</i>

16:28.238 --> 16:29.406
Shit.

16:35.704 --> 16:38.790
So, how are things going with Bradley?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.959
Is it #Ladley 2.0?

16:42.211 --> 16:44.588
- They're good. Yeah.
- Yeah, but is it, like, honeymoony,

16:44.588 --> 16:46.673
or did it feel like you were
picking up where you left off?

16:46.673 --> 16:51.220
Well, we left off by breaking up,
so it's definitely easier.

16:52.095 --> 16:55.390
I mean, the only problem is that
I'm out the door before she's awake,

16:55.390 --> 16:58.227
and then by the time I'm coming home,
she's heading out the door,

16:58.227 --> 16:59.603
- so...
- Yeah.

16:59.603 --> 17:04.191
Though apparently, she spent an entire day
with Cory Ellison and his mother.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.108
Oh, my God, I knew they had a thing.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.320
They didn't have a thing. There was
no thing. Bradley would have told me.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.240
Yeah, but you said that he was into her.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.699
And he is oddly compelling

17:12.699 --> 17:15.410
in a kind of Patrick Bateman
in a vinyl raincoat kind of way.

17:17.246 --> 17:21.791
Laura. She is not going to tell you
if they've ever been together.

17:22.751 --> 17:23.919
She's just not.

17:23.919 --> 17:27.214
And, honestly, when was the last time
you spent an entire day

17:27.214 --> 17:30.008
with the mother of someone
you weren't sleeping with?

17:30.008 --> 17:31.093
You should read her emails.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.389
Audra, come on.
I'm not going through her phone.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.016
And you won't have to.
Everything's online 'cause of the hack.

17:38.016 --> 17:41.311
It takes some serious digging,
but you can find it all on one website.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.813
I'm gonna send you a link.

17:42.813 --> 17:44.481
Okay, let's do a mic test.

17:47.776 --> 17:50.279
Okay.
Last segment, guys. Let's bring it in.

17:50.279 --> 17:51.905
We're good? Thank you.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.414
Do I have to ask,
or do you just wanna tell me?

18:02.165 --> 18:05.335
Someone spray-painted
Saint Patrick's Cathedral with the words

18:05.335 --> 18:07.254
from my SCOTUS post
right on the front door.

18:08.005 --> 18:10.591
These people. Who defaces a church?

18:10.591 --> 18:13.468
Well, you wanted to send a message, so...

18:13.468 --> 18:15.137
- Yanko.
- What?

18:15.137 --> 18:16.346
I didn't ask for this.

18:16.346 --> 18:18.098
Chris, you have two million followers.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.391
What do you think they're all gonna do?

18:19.391 --> 18:21.894
Just sit back and clap politely
when you tell the Supreme Court

18:21.894 --> 18:24.146
- to abort itself? I'm just saying.
- Okay, nope. Nope.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.356
- I literally cannot with this today.
- I'm just saying. You know?

18:26.356 --> 18:28.692
And what about all those people
who want to adopt?

18:28.692 --> 18:31.361
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to make it through that screening process?

18:31.361 --> 18:33.739
- Yanko. Stop.
- Well, do you--

18:33.739 --> 18:37.242
Five, four, three...

18:39.369 --> 18:40.204
And welcome back.

18:40.204 --> 18:42.748
And in just a few moments,
I'm gonna be talking to Hope Ballard,

18:42.748 --> 18:45.042
a former clerk
to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.836
She's gonna give us an inside take
on how the court might be reacting

18:47.836 --> 18:49.880
to this historic leak. And Chris?

18:49.880 --> 18:53.926
And right now, I'll be chatting
with the winners of UBA's breakout hit,

18:53.926 --> 18:55.302
<i>Wedding Cake Wars</i>.

18:55.302 --> 18:58.388
- Congratulations, Todd and Andrew.
- Thank you.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.390
What do you want her to do?
Apologize on air?

19:00.390 --> 19:02.935
She's gonna have to start reporting on Roe
at some point.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.686
What?

19:06.188 --> 19:09.691
This massive story breaks,
and she makes it about her?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.985
What did Chris think was gonna happen
when she made that post?

19:11.985 --> 19:15.113
I don't think she was making it about her.
She said what a lot of us are feeling.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.115
Go one.

19:19.493 --> 19:23.413
- What the-- André. Mother--
- What's wrong?

19:23.413 --> 19:25.457
Can you cover for me? I'll be right back.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.419
<i>I'm sure everyone back home
is super proud of you.</i>

19:29.419 --> 19:32.840
<i>We need to go to commercial so that
I can have some alone time with this cake.</i>

19:32.840 --> 19:33.757
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

19:46.603 --> 19:49.439
What the fuck? What the fucking fuck?

19:50.357 --> 19:53.443
You're in New York? On fucking <i>YDA</i>?

19:53.443 --> 19:55.779
You can reach out to my agent
if you want me on your show.

19:57.239 --> 19:58.365
Really? Really?

19:58.365 --> 20:00.325
Or you could send
a gift basket to my hotel.

20:00.325 --> 20:04.079
"Dear André. Thank you for all
of your hard work behind enemy lines."

20:04.079 --> 20:05.205
That'd be nice.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.666
You're fucking unbelievable.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.085
You do not text. You do not call.

20:10.085 --> 20:11.587
You fucking disappeared.

20:11.587 --> 20:13.046
I thought you were dead.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.507
I was trying to keep my ass
out of a fucking gulag.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.758
Getting pictures for you, Mia.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.511
Don't you dare. Don't you fucking dare.

20:19.511 --> 20:23.390
- Well, it's the truth, isn't it?
- You wanted to go. You always wanna go.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.476
You choose work over everything else

20:26.476 --> 20:28.729
because you are a middle-aged
adrenaline junkie

20:28.729 --> 20:32.983
who would rather bounce between wars
than commit to a zip code.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.625
Alex Levy. Just who I was looking for.

20:50.292 --> 20:53.504
And you found me in my office.
Way to go, Columbo.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.422
Good.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.008
How are things?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.428
If you're gonna tell me that
I should've kept it in my pants, then--

21:01.428 --> 21:02.429
No, no.

21:02.429 --> 21:05.015
I'm here to talk to you
about your hit show.

21:05.015 --> 21:08.477
So, Chip and I,
we just recut your interview with Paul

21:08.477 --> 21:10.103
in light of the recent revelations.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.356
I want you to have a look
at it when you have a chance.

21:12.356 --> 21:14.858
Yeah. I don't need to take a look.
I'm bumping it.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.735
Yeah, about that, we--

21:16.735 --> 21:20.197
We've been running promos all weekend,
so it's really...

21:20.197 --> 21:22.074
Yeah. Well, I'm pivoting.

21:22.074 --> 21:24.993
We just booked the head of legal
at Planned Parenthood.

21:24.993 --> 21:27.496
So, she will be my guest this week.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.041
We have a shareholder vote on the deal,

21:31.041 --> 21:34.837
and your little make-out session
with the prom king

21:34.837 --> 21:38.298
is creating a massive perception problem.

21:38.298 --> 21:40.259
So, pulling the interview

21:40.259 --> 21:44.471
that you insisted on
and that we have hyped relentlessly--

21:44.471 --> 21:46.682
Sorry. No, we can't.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.520
Cory, we are covering

21:51.520 --> 21:55.440
the most important story
for American women in 50 years.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.276
- Believe me, I get it.
- Uh-huh.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.778
My mother has instilled in me
the belief that

21:59.778 --> 22:02.948
what a woman chooses to do
with her body, that is her business.

22:02.948 --> 22:07.244
Yeah. Which is exactly why gossip about
my private life should be off the table.

22:09.830 --> 22:11.206
Come on, Cory.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.794
Understood. Fine.

22:16.795 --> 22:19.339
We will run the interview next week.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.677
And I will need to take a look
at that edit.

22:28.307 --> 22:29.975
Alex, you know, I don't have to do this.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.978
I'm trying to play nice here.

22:35.647 --> 22:39.318
Well, listen, the deal
will be closing very soon,

22:39.318 --> 22:41.278
so you'll be answering to new management.

22:47.451 --> 22:49.369
You never cease to surprise me, Alex.

22:50.370 --> 22:56.168
You are on the verge of getting everything
you ever wanted out of this place.

22:56.168 --> 22:58.045
Power in your own right.

22:58.045 --> 23:02.841
And you choose instead to be
the girlfriend, the plus-one.

23:03.759 --> 23:04.843
And that's not me talking.

23:04.843 --> 23:08.430
That is, sadly,
the patriarchal cesspool that we live in.

23:08.430 --> 23:12.518
But now, I can promise you
every decision you make at UBA,

23:12.518 --> 23:16.480
it'll be pulled apart
and scrutinized by the public.

23:16.480 --> 23:20.150
Not to mention everybody in this building.

23:25.656 --> 23:26.907
Ain't love grand?

23:30.035 --> 23:31.703
Don't forget to shut the door
on your way out.

23:40.671 --> 23:41.672
Boop.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.758
Asshole.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.806
Mel said you ordered this.
I thought you didn't like this place.

23:50.806 --> 23:51.723
I don't.

23:52.307 --> 23:53.684
Sorry. Somebody messed up.

23:53.684 --> 23:55.561
This order says it's for Kate D.

23:55.561 --> 23:57.354
Wait a second. Yeah.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.940
- Okay. Enjoy.
- Okay. Thanks.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.632
Don't turn around.

24:26.425 --> 24:27.426
Kate?

24:27.926 --> 24:29.845
I will talk on the record,
but only to you.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.972
Okay. Can I record this conversation?

24:31.972 --> 24:34.183
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.976
The Theater at City Tech in Brooklyn.

24:36.643 --> 24:37.686
Just you.

24:38.729 --> 24:40.856
I'll tell you everything I know
about Hyperion.

24:40.856 --> 24:41.940
Okay.

25:15.307 --> 25:16.350
Hey.

25:16.350 --> 25:18.727
- <i>Why are you up?</i>
- Well, what are you doing up?

25:18.727 --> 25:20.604
I've got an engine test in a few hours.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.397
<i>Everything okay there?</i>

25:22.397 --> 25:24.858
I just wanted you to know
that I had to pull our interview

25:24.858 --> 25:26.235
so I could focus on SCOTUS.

25:27.528 --> 25:28.529
Okay.

25:29.363 --> 25:31.907
- You don't think that dodges the issue?
- <i>Yeah. Too late.</i>

25:31.907 --> 25:34.618
That issue is already everywhere.

25:36.453 --> 25:40.123
Everybody's just fucking whispering
and gossiping, and it's just maddening.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.458
It's so maddening.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.755
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

25:46.755 --> 25:49.216
I'm assuming none of that's happening
where you are?

25:49.883 --> 25:51.510
No. No, it isn't.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.932
Look, if you're having
second thoughts about this,

25:57.683 --> 26:01.144
- if you wanna pump the brakes, we can--
- No, no, of course I don't.

26:05.190 --> 26:06.358
I just, you know...

26:07.067 --> 26:09.778
<i>Yeah, I know. Me too.</i>

26:12.656 --> 26:14.116
Levy, you need to sleep.

26:14.116 --> 26:17.369
Someone's gotta tell the people about all
the shitty things happening in the world.

26:18.245 --> 26:20.497
I know. Trigger laws wait for no one.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.960
- <i>I gotta go.</i>
- Okay.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.088
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

26:37.723 --> 26:41.268
- So, how many people hate my guts today?
- Fifty-seven.

26:41.768 --> 26:44.771
- That's it?
- Well, fan mail ain't what it used to be.

26:51.862 --> 26:53.280
This one was nice at least.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.325
She asked for a signed photo.

27:04.041 --> 27:06.376
"Dear Chris, you inspire me to do my best.

27:06.376 --> 27:10.380
This year I'm going to be the anchor
in the 4-by-100 relay.

27:10.964 --> 27:14.009
Maybe someday... Team USA."

27:15.093 --> 27:16.386
That's sweet.

27:24.311 --> 27:26.939
Planned Parenthood dropped out?
What the fuck, Chip?

27:26.939 --> 27:28.607
I know. I'm sorry. Linda apologized.

27:28.607 --> 27:30.192
You were supposed to take care of NBN.

27:30.192 --> 27:31.902
- I don't understand what's happening.
- I tried.

27:31.902 --> 27:34.112
Everybody's going after
the same interview subjects.

27:34.112 --> 27:35.781
- I mean, it's brutal out there.
- Jesus, God.

27:35.781 --> 27:37.324
But look, I got some alts, okay?

27:37.324 --> 27:38.784
What about Tara Spitz?

27:38.784 --> 27:41.245
- The rep from Missouri?
- Yeah. State's got a trigger ban.

27:41.245 --> 27:43.163
No, she's an opportunist,

27:43.163 --> 27:45.916
and all she cares about is airtime
for her reelection campaign.

27:45.916 --> 27:47.000
Okay, there's James Scanlon,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.710
- constitutional professor from Princeton.
- Okay.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.838
Interesting idea about an interview
about women's bodies.

27:50.838 --> 27:54.383
- Let's try to book a woman, please.
- Fine. Jess Bennett, okay?

27:54.383 --> 27:56.927
She's a cofounder
of that online magazine <i>The Break</i>.

27:56.927 --> 27:58.387
They just broke that huge story

27:58.387 --> 28:00.722
about Rebekah Mercer
backstabbing the CEO of Parler.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.224
- I mean, it's--
- Come on, Chip.

28:03.141 --> 28:06.603
This is about overturning Roe,
the legacy of the court.

28:07.437 --> 28:11.525
<i>- The Break</i> is glorified gossip.
- Respectfully, she's gonna have a take.

28:11.525 --> 28:13.819
She did a post during the whole
Merrick Garland fiasco

28:13.819 --> 28:15.737
predicting that that could lead
to the end of Roe.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.114
She was the first one to call it.

28:18.574 --> 28:21.076
Okay. All right, that's interesting.

28:21.577 --> 28:23.328
She can kind of read
the tea leaves on this stuff, okay?

28:23.328 --> 28:26.081
Plus, it won't be the same,
like, you know, center-left,

28:26.081 --> 28:28.417
institutional apologist bullshit
that everybody else is gonna run.

28:28.417 --> 28:30.002
God. I prepped for Planned Parenthood.

28:30.002 --> 28:32.296
I know. But look,
we got an hour until we shoot, okay?

28:32.296 --> 28:34.381
I've read a ton of the stuff. I got you.

28:34.381 --> 28:36.091
Wear an earpiece. It's gonna be fine.

28:38.886 --> 28:39.970
All right, fine. Fine.

28:39.970 --> 28:43.182
- Just get me everything you have on her.
- All right. I'm on it.

28:44.183 --> 28:47.853
This week's Supreme Court leak
raised a number of issues.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.022
Among them, the issue of minority rule.

28:50.606 --> 28:53.942
In theory, democracy is
one person, one vote.

28:53.942 --> 28:57.863
But in the case of the Supreme Court,
nine unelected individuals

28:57.863 --> 29:00.949
control deeply private aspects
of American life.

29:01.700 --> 29:04.786
Jess, you wrote a piece, back in 2016,

29:04.786 --> 29:08.457
predicting that Roe would be overturned
way before anybody else saw this coming.

29:08.457 --> 29:10.667
Well, I just looked at the clues,
and I did the math.

29:11.168 --> 29:15.631
And it would seem like this ruling
could also threaten other liberties,

29:15.631 --> 29:18.050
such as gay marriage, for example.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.302
Absolutely.
This is really just the beginning.

29:20.302 --> 29:21.720
And there is no doubt

29:21.720 --> 29:25.098
that these nine unelected individuals
have disproportionate power.

29:25.766 --> 29:29.311
Though, I would argue that
when we're talking about minority rule,

29:29.311 --> 29:33.232
the real problem that we're facing is
from billionaires and dark money.

29:33.232 --> 29:35.984
I mean, in terms of social control,

29:35.984 --> 29:38.612
these people have
this outsized influence in media

29:38.612 --> 29:40.781
that frankly scares the shit out of me.

29:40.781 --> 29:43.033
I think the fourth estate
is in serious trouble.

29:43.617 --> 29:45.202
Ask about Bezos.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.289
Is the fourth estate in trouble?

29:50.499 --> 29:52.918
I mean, Jeff Bezos bought
<i>The Washington Post</i>,

29:52.918 --> 29:54.962
and by all accounts,
he's stayed hands-off.

29:54.962 --> 29:56.171
Sure, for now.

29:56.171 --> 29:59.258
But Wall Street has made these guys
impossibly rich,

29:59.258 --> 30:01.385
and the bull market's
about to jump off a cliff.

30:01.385 --> 30:03.303
So, what happens when the music stops?

30:03.303 --> 30:08.684
- Okay. Going back to the Supreme Court--
- Right. Populated by judges

30:08.684 --> 30:11.812
who are selected by politicians
who are controlled by lobbyists

30:11.812 --> 30:13.397
who are funded by billionaires.

30:13.981 --> 30:14.982
It's a direct line.

30:15.858 --> 30:18.318
You can't talk about these things
inside of a vacuum.

30:18.318 --> 30:20.904
And what happens when the infrastructure

30:20.904 --> 30:24.241
of public discourse is owned
by private enterprises?

30:24.241 --> 30:27.035
Take UBA for example. Paul Marks
hasn't even bought this place yet--

30:27.035 --> 30:28.787
Jess, we're talking about Roe.

30:28.787 --> 30:31.915
No, we're talking about unchecked power.

30:31.915 --> 30:36.461
I'm talking about how women confront power
in the era of minority rule.

30:36.461 --> 30:39.673
I'm sorry. But if a reporter
hooks up with a billionaire

30:39.673 --> 30:42.134
who is buying her media company,

30:42.134 --> 30:44.011
people are going to ask questions.

30:44.887 --> 30:49.725
Like, "Is she actually capable
of speaking truth to power?"

31:03.071 --> 31:05.532
You know that I'm not the news this week.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.078
Nor is UBA or Paul Marks.

31:11.580 --> 31:17.753
We're here to talk about millions of women
who are losing control over their bodies.

31:17.753 --> 31:20.881
Sure. But you did just prove my point.

31:22.424 --> 31:26.512
The story is whatever you decide it is.
You and Paul Marks.

31:32.434 --> 31:36.271
To be frank, I did not want to talk about
my private life this week.

31:36.855 --> 31:40.692
I did not want to distract
from the actual news.

31:43.153 --> 31:46.949
So, can we, before this news cycle
moves on to the next horror,

31:47.616 --> 31:50.661
just for five minutes,
focus on women's rights?

31:52.871 --> 31:53.705
Okay.

31:53.705 --> 31:55.374
What happened to "I'll be in your ear"?

31:55.374 --> 31:58.418
You just stood there with your dick
in your hand like you didn't give a shit.

31:58.418 --> 31:59.878
It looks like you handled it, okay?

31:59.878 --> 32:00.963
- So I--
- Handled it?

32:00.963 --> 32:03.090
I'm not supposed to handle it.
That's not my job.

32:03.090 --> 32:06.802
She obviously came here to fuck with me
and get more clicks for her blog.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.595
You didn't catch up on that
in the preinterview?

32:08.595 --> 32:11.265
I don't know. I think she raised
some issues that, frankly,

32:11.265 --> 32:12.891
- honestly, people are curious about.
- Uh-huh.

32:12.891 --> 32:15.561
I find it a little hard
to believe you couldn't see that coming.

32:16.144 --> 32:19.773
- You're un-fucking-believable.
- Hey. Don't put this on me.

32:19.773 --> 32:21.859
- You set yourself up for this, okay?
- Okay.

32:21.859 --> 32:23.110
- I did? Okay.
- Yes.

32:23.110 --> 32:25.946
You refused to put out a statement,
and you fucking pulled the interview.

32:25.946 --> 32:28.907
An interview that you edited
behind my back.

32:28.907 --> 32:31.869
Yeah, you wouldn't listen to anybody.
Send in Doug. I come in. Cory comes in.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.203
You refuse to speak to any of us.

32:33.203 --> 32:35.247
- Oh, right, the three wise men.
- Okay.

32:35.247 --> 32:37.499
- I'm sorry. My bad. Got it.
- Oh, God.

32:37.499 --> 32:40.085
You know what? Two years I've spent
of my life building this show,

32:40.085 --> 32:42.713
and turns out all it takes
is one negligent producer to just--

32:42.713 --> 32:45.215
You would not have a show
if it wasn't for me, okay?

32:45.215 --> 32:46.967
<i>Alex Unfiltered</i> was my idea.

32:46.967 --> 32:48.093
- Okay.
- I rebrand you.

32:48.093 --> 32:51.305
I do it over and over again.
You're fucking lucky that I do.

32:51.305 --> 32:52.222
'Cause guess what.

32:52.222 --> 32:54.349
Anything good that comes along,
you just light a little fire

32:54.349 --> 32:56.101
- and explode it right away.
- Oh, I see. Sure, I do.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.936
Sleeping with the boss only works
until it doesn't, Alex.

32:57.936 --> 33:00.480
- Mitch was not my boss!
- Yeah, well, he was everybody else's.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.900
Okay. Said the guy who I walked in on

33:02.900 --> 33:04.902
- fucking my assistant in my very own home.
- Oh, God.

33:04.902 --> 33:06.320
Well, great. You fixed that.

33:06.320 --> 33:09.198
You don't have to deal with that anymore.
You fucked it up too. Congratulations.

33:14.745 --> 33:18.290
Okay, I can't do this anymore.

33:22.211 --> 33:23.212
You're fired.

33:27.299 --> 33:29.510
Come-- Alex, come on. You w--

33:30.427 --> 33:31.428
- Alex--
- Get out.

33:43.148 --> 33:46.652
Just so you know--
You know, I never had COVID.

33:47.945 --> 33:50.364
I came into your apartment,
I saw you crumpled up on the floor,

33:50.364 --> 33:53.367
and I did what I always do.

33:53.367 --> 33:54.701
You know, I rescued you.

34:00.123 --> 34:01.792
I guess you don't need that anymore.

34:05.838 --> 34:07.339
And neither do I. Yeah.

34:22.145 --> 34:24.565
You're gonna be late
for the fucking photo shoot.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.568
- They can wait.
- Jesus, fuck.

34:27.568 --> 34:28.944
How much booze have you had?

34:28.944 --> 34:31.071
- Not enough.
- I heard it was bad.

34:31.071 --> 34:33.824
- It was a fucking disaster.
- I mean--

34:33.824 --> 34:36.201
We're not gonna make the launch.
Not at this rate.

34:36.201 --> 34:38.829
I heard you lost it
in front of a lot of people.

34:38.829 --> 34:40.330
It was the fucking bleed.

34:40.330 --> 34:41.915
We should've caught it months ago,

34:41.915 --> 34:43.958
but we were all focused
on the hydrogen leak.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.378
NASA's gonna pull out.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.090
If I fail at this, all anyone's gonna talk
about is my privilege.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.175
My fucking privilege.

34:51.175 --> 34:53.927
As if I'm from some trust fund
with some safety net.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.390
If I fuck this up, then what's waiting?

34:59.308 --> 35:00.559
Come on.

35:09.443 --> 35:11.570
There's a Duane Reade
five minutes from here.

35:11.570 --> 35:14.531
We're gonna need gum, Gatorade,
Red Bull and deodorant.

35:14.531 --> 35:15.616
Let's go.

35:29.338 --> 35:31.465
Fuck it. Okay.

36:34.736 --> 36:36.321
- Thank you.
- Of course.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.116
He walks among us.

36:39.116 --> 36:40.576
Cory. Sorry I'm late.

36:41.743 --> 36:42.744
Hi.

36:44.371 --> 36:45.205
Hi.

36:45.706 --> 36:46.999
Thank you.

37:30.542 --> 37:32.377
Good. Shoulder to shoulder.

37:33.545 --> 37:35.672
I didn't know
there was a pregame for this.

37:35.672 --> 37:38.717
You just need to loosen up,
or was there a lover's quarrel?

37:38.717 --> 37:41.595
How about don't concern yourself
with my personal life.

37:42.095 --> 37:43.013
Can you guys both face me?

37:44.348 --> 37:45.974
Hey, you wanna fuck the talent,
go right ahead.

37:45.974 --> 37:49.186
But rolling up here like this?

37:49.186 --> 37:52.272
- Don't fuck the deal.
- Or what? You'll leave?

37:53.232 --> 37:55.567
- Okay, guys, give me one sec.
- Yeah, why don't you take a couple?

37:55.567 --> 37:57.653
You know what, Cory? You're a small man.

37:57.653 --> 37:59.112
I didn't really notice it at first,

37:59.112 --> 38:01.990
but after the last few months
of staring at the top of your head,

38:01.990 --> 38:03.617
I kinda can't unsee it now.

38:03.617 --> 38:04.993
Yeah, boy.

38:06.662 --> 38:09.289
The hooch makes him hateful.
Or maybe it's the air up there.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.542
It must be a little thin, 'cause hypoxia,

38:11.542 --> 38:13.585
- it can mess with your brain function.
- Oh, yeah.

38:17.339 --> 38:19.299
You think this is gonna be easy,
don't you?

38:19.299 --> 38:21.802
You green-light a couple shows,
you come to a couple premieres,

38:21.802 --> 38:23.971
and then you fuck back off
to your little desert lair.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.014
UBA is not a hobby.

38:26.014 --> 38:28.308
You're not making sourdough starter
in a mason jar.

38:28.308 --> 38:30.227
It's bankers breathing down your neck.

38:30.227 --> 38:34.565
It's ad boys pulling a hundred million
in Viagra ads from your NFL playoff game

38:34.565 --> 38:36.525
because Pfizer just lost the patent
for hard-ons.

38:36.525 --> 38:40.612
And when the Wall Street vultures
start circling, and they will,

38:41.780 --> 38:43.240
you will need my counsel.

38:43.907 --> 38:44.992
And I don't know.

38:44.992 --> 38:47.244
With that attitude of yours,
I don't know where I'll be.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.454
And when it all goes south,

38:49.454 --> 38:51.081
I don't see Alex sticking by.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.002
That's interesting.
You talk a lot about Alex,

38:55.002 --> 38:57.045
but she doesn't really ever mention you.

39:15.022 --> 39:16.398
What the fuck?

39:29.077 --> 39:30.329
Jesus.

39:52.809 --> 39:54.019
Oh, my God.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.357
Fucking hell.

41:08.343 --> 41:12.181
<i>At 12:53 p.m.,
the outer perimeter is breached.</i>

41:13.640 --> 41:19.188
<i>Imagine, complete chaos within the walls
of this monument to democracy.</i>

41:20.022 --> 41:23.942
No one knows where to go or what to do.

41:32.743 --> 41:34.453
You're back. That's a relief.

41:34.453 --> 41:36.663
Yeah. Well, we still have a few months
before the launch.

41:36.663 --> 41:37.998
We just need more cash.

41:37.998 --> 41:39.917
Gonna run some numbers.
I think I see a way out of this.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.710
There's something else.

41:42.294 --> 41:43.420
When we let Kate Danton go,

41:43.420 --> 41:46.048
she told everyone
she was headed to Palo Alto.

41:46.048 --> 41:48.175
- And?
- And she flew to New York instead.

41:48.175 --> 41:50.135
I called her today, and she didn't answer.

41:51.428 --> 41:52.721
Do you think she could be a problem?

41:53.972 --> 41:54.973
I don't know. Maybe.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.160
- Hey.
- <i>Bradley, hey.</i>

42:15.661 --> 42:19.122
Listen, I might be a little late
tonight because we have a thing at <i>TMS</i>.

42:19.831 --> 42:22.793
Actually, I'm at my place.
I'm not feeling so great.

42:22.793 --> 42:25.212
Oh, no. Do you think it's COVID?

42:25.212 --> 42:27.756
No, I don't think so. I tested negative.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.008
But I'm gonna sleep here, just in case.

42:30.509 --> 42:33.095
Okay, well,
let me know if I can bring you anything.

42:33.095 --> 42:34.304
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

42:36.139 --> 42:37.516
I just need some time.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.268
<i>Okay.</i>

42:40.811 --> 42:41.812
Laura?

42:43.438 --> 42:45.524
I love you. You know that, right?

42:48.861 --> 42:50.237
I love you too.

42:51.530 --> 42:53.782
Okay. Feel better.

43:05.377 --> 43:07.462
- Hey, Yanko. How are you?
- Hey. What's up?

43:07.462 --> 43:08.755
Hey. You're here late.

43:09.339 --> 43:11.341
Yeah. Just taking a minute.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.677
Oh, my God. What happened?
Did you hurt yourself?

43:15.429 --> 43:19.850
I went for a run to clear my head,
and I managed to fuck up my leg.

43:21.059 --> 43:22.936
Yeah, I've never DNF'ed.

43:23.770 --> 43:24.771
DNF'ed?

43:24.771 --> 43:26.190
It means "did not finish."

43:27.191 --> 43:30.903
It's stupid, but it wasn't a race
or anything that-- Yeah.

43:32.571 --> 43:33.739
You miss being out there?

43:34.656 --> 43:35.657
Yeah.

43:37.117 --> 43:39.995
But I do not belong on that track anymore.

43:39.995 --> 43:42.497
No matter how much I train,
it's not coming back.

43:42.497 --> 43:43.707
Yeah.

43:45.751 --> 43:51.131
I dream of the final lap, the final turn.

43:53.884 --> 43:55.511
Passing on the outside.

43:59.348 --> 44:00.599
I never get caught.

44:06.897 --> 44:12.861
Hey, look, about yesterday.
What I said. It's none of my business.

44:12.861 --> 44:16.073
It's no-- And I'm-- I wanna apologize.
I was way out of line.

44:16.073 --> 44:17.991
Yes. You were.

44:19.785 --> 44:21.703
But there are a lot of things
we're never gonna agree on.

44:21.703 --> 44:24.623
I know. I know.
But you're my colleague, and I screwed up.

44:25.123 --> 44:28.168
You know? And you got
so much going on as it is, and...

44:31.088 --> 44:32.881
Did you really try to adopt a kid?

44:35.509 --> 44:38.428
You know, you can always babysit mine
if you really wanna try it on.

44:38.428 --> 44:41.056
It might change your mind.

44:46.478 --> 44:48.272
Hey, we're all gonna get together
in a few minutes.

44:48.272 --> 44:49.481
You wanna come join?

44:49.982 --> 44:52.067
I didn't think that
that was something I should go to.

44:52.067 --> 44:53.527
Not at all. Come on.
We'd love to have you.

44:53.527 --> 44:55.237
You're part of the family.

44:58.073 --> 44:58.907
Yeah.

45:03.829 --> 45:04.997
Is this a bad time?

45:06.915 --> 45:08.125
Yeah, actually.

45:12.796 --> 45:13.797
I'm sorry.

45:15.841 --> 45:16.967
For not calling.

45:16.967 --> 45:19.928
For going on <i>YDA</i>.
I know how much you hate them.

45:20.470 --> 45:21.763
You can go on <i>YDA</i>.

45:22.723 --> 45:25.267
You can go on <i>Eagle News</i>.
You don't owe me anything.

45:28.604 --> 45:30.147
I'm just glad you're safe.

45:32.649 --> 45:36.528
Even though I'm a middle-aged
adrenaline junkie who--

45:36.528 --> 45:38.780
- Can't commit to a zip code. Yeah.
- That was it.

45:39.489 --> 45:40.490
That was a good one.

45:42.910 --> 45:43.994
It was a good one.

45:47.998 --> 45:50.459
Do you know what I was thinking
when I was laid up in that hospital?

45:51.668 --> 45:52.503
No.

45:52.503 --> 45:55.339
I was thinking about how much of a shit
I was to you about Mitch.

45:57.049 --> 45:58.759
How maybe I deserved to get hit.

46:02.721 --> 46:03.805
And...

46:05.599 --> 46:08.227
I thought a lot
about being at your place with you.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.232
Why are you here, André?

46:15.484 --> 46:16.485
I miss you.

46:19.488 --> 46:21.198
So, what, you wanna try again?

46:22.491 --> 46:23.492
Yeah, maybe.

46:26.161 --> 46:27.663
You're not changing for me.

46:29.248 --> 46:30.707
I'm not changing for you.

46:32.918 --> 46:34.044
This is who we are.

46:39.800 --> 46:42.010
I always do this.
I always give myself to people like you.

46:42.010 --> 46:43.387
Men who say the right things

46:43.387 --> 46:46.265
and then, you know,
they pull away when you need them.

46:51.770 --> 46:52.855
I can't do it anymore.

46:54.481 --> 46:55.607
Mia.

46:57.401 --> 46:59.570
We can't do this here.
This is where I work.

47:00.904 --> 47:03.115
Then we'll go somewhere else. Talk.

47:06.785 --> 47:08.245
No, I can't. I have a thing.

47:13.709 --> 47:14.710
Okay.

47:23.385 --> 47:24.553
Where you wanna go?

47:26.138 --> 47:27.222
It doesn't matter.

47:29.600 --> 47:30.684
Just come with me.

47:50.329 --> 47:51.663
Fucking hell. Thank God.

47:53.081 --> 47:54.082
Hi.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.043
Hey there.

47:56.627 --> 47:57.628
You okay?

47:58.587 --> 48:01.340
Oh, boy. Looks like you had
as good a week as I had.

48:01.924 --> 48:02.925
Something like that.

48:06.637 --> 48:07.638
Come here.

48:07.638 --> 48:10.599
Yeah. It was a total shit show.

48:10.599 --> 48:11.808
Oh, shit.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.852
We'll be lucky
if we make the summer launch.

48:14.353 --> 48:17.606
Honestly. It's just not looking good.

48:17.606 --> 48:19.566
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

48:22.069 --> 48:23.070
Tell me about you.

48:23.070 --> 48:27.032
Well, my colleagues don't
think that I can do my job

48:27.032 --> 48:29.826
and be with you at the same time.

48:30.452 --> 48:31.870
That's ridiculous.

48:32.454 --> 48:34.164
They've been absolutely awful.

48:38.001 --> 48:41.171
And I... fired Chip.

48:45.467 --> 48:47.135
- Wow.
- I know.

48:48.720 --> 48:52.474
And I've just been sitting here thinking,
you know, maybe it's time.

48:53.767 --> 48:57.020
Maybe it's just time
I finally leave this place.

48:58.856 --> 49:01.483
I don't have anyone over there anymore,

49:02.734 --> 49:04.528
and it just doesn't feel
like a home anymore.

49:04.528 --> 49:07.114
I don't know.
I just don't think it's worth saving.

49:09.283 --> 49:11.451
I'm sorry.
This is not what you wanted to hear.

49:11.451 --> 49:12.536
No, no.

49:13.787 --> 49:17.916
What if we went in a different direction?

49:19.459 --> 49:20.294
What do you mean?

49:20.294 --> 49:22.963
Well, I've been thinking about UBA
as this long-term investment.

49:22.963 --> 49:26.675
Pays off in ten, 15,
20 years down the line. But...

49:28.427 --> 49:31.471
it doesn't really make any sense anymore.
You know, you're not happy.

49:32.014 --> 49:35.601
And I'm gonna need to start throwing
a ton of money at Hyperion very soon.

49:39.313 --> 49:40.522
What if we sell?

49:42.191 --> 49:44.151
Sell? UBA?

49:44.151 --> 49:45.694
Right after the deal goes through.

49:45.694 --> 49:50.115
The whole thing.
We-- There's no more sports division.

49:50.115 --> 49:53.660
No more UBA+.
You sell off the scripted content.

49:53.660 --> 49:57.456
You sell off the movie franchises,
the NFL contracts. All of it.

49:59.708 --> 50:01.835
Then we start over from the ground up.

50:03.420 --> 50:07.674
We build something new on our terms
centered on news.

50:08.926 --> 50:10.511
Exactly the way we want.

50:12.471 --> 50:13.472
You're serious.

50:17.226 --> 50:20.229
You have been wanting to run things
for a long time.

50:22.689 --> 50:24.316
Maybe you start right now.

50:39.498 --> 50:42.376
This needs to be off-book.
Nothing in writing.

50:42.376 --> 50:44.878
No paper trail before the deal closes.

50:44.878 --> 50:48.590
We need to know the actual value
of UBA's assets.

50:48.590 --> 50:53.095
The content library,
the licenses, all of it.

50:55.681 --> 50:57.808
Well, it sounds like
you're planning a fire sale.

50:59.101 --> 51:01.061
You want to put the old girl
out to pasture?

51:02.563 --> 51:03.814
I'd be happy to help.

51:12.406 --> 51:14.157
- Donny.
- Hey, Chip.

51:14.157 --> 51:15.909
- How are you?
- Good to see you, guys.

51:15.909 --> 51:16.994
Hey.

51:17.661 --> 51:18.787
Yeah.

51:21.665 --> 51:22.708
Hey, guys.

51:24.042 --> 51:25.544
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, Chip.

51:27.504 --> 51:28.672
How you doing? You doing okay?

51:37.723 --> 51:38.932
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:39.433 --> 51:40.642
You okay?

51:42.644 --> 51:43.645
I don't know.

51:46.148 --> 51:47.482
Alex just fired me.

51:48.734 --> 51:49.735
What?

51:50.277 --> 51:51.361
Are you serious?

51:52.446 --> 51:53.655
It's a long story.

51:54.364 --> 51:56.283
Well, what happened?

51:58.744 --> 52:00.120
Paul Marks happened.

52:01.288 --> 52:02.414
Oh, my God.

52:03.832 --> 52:04.833
All right.

52:07.794 --> 52:11.173
Look, I might call you about
something that I need your help with.

52:12.424 --> 52:15.802
Yeah, sure.
I mean, my schedule's wide open, so--

52:17.554 --> 52:19.348
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

52:20.140 --> 52:21.141
Thanks.

52:21.642 --> 52:22.935
- Is Mia coming?
- I don't know.

52:22.935 --> 52:24.561
I checked her office, but I guess not.

52:25.145 --> 52:26.146
There you go.

52:26.730 --> 52:27.731
Thanks, honey.

52:35.072 --> 52:37.533
First, I just want to thank everyone
for taking the time

52:37.533 --> 52:39.785
out of this crazy week to come tonight.

52:40.661 --> 52:44.039
I think one of the hardest things
about this pandemic, for me,

52:44.039 --> 52:49.545
was not being able to honor
the anniversary all together in person.

52:50.712 --> 52:54.550
So I'm really grateful
that we could gather this year.

53:08.814 --> 53:09.815
To Hannah.

53:10.524 --> 53:11.733
To Hannah.

53:13.151 --> 53:14.319
To Hannah.
