-Yep, you got it.

disappointed us our entire lives.

-That's right.
-Ha-ha. I read the book. Twice.

BREE: See you guys.

40:18.874 --> 40:19.917
MICK: Bye!
BREE: Be safe.

40:21.001 --> 40:24.130
-Have fun.
MEGAN: <i>So, looking back...</i>

40:24.296 --> 40:26.799
<i>...we never intended to hurt anyone.</i>

40:26.966 --> 40:29.552
<i>But in our efforts to save ourselves...</i> <i>...we made decisions that hurt us all.</i>

40:32.471 --> 40:34.515
<i>Instead of taking care of the present...</i>

40:34.682 --> 40:37.393
<i>...we focused on pushing</i>
<i>our troubles into the past.</i>

40:37.560 --> 40:40.354
<i>And we worked so hard</i>
<i>to move forward...</i>

40:40.521 --> 40:43.399
<i>...that we left the ones</i>
<i>we loved behind.</i>

40:47.570 --> 40:48.737
Hey, man.

40:48.904 --> 40:51.365
-You mind signing an autograph?
-Of course.

40:51.991 --> 40:54.910
It's, uh, for my daughter.

40:55.327 --> 40:56.996
Come on in, honey.

40:59.331 --> 41:00.916
My pleasure.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.919
-What's your name?
-Nina.

41:07.965 --> 41:09.008
Here you go, Nina.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.303
-Thank you.
-Enjoy the show.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.640
Thank you.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.185
[♪♪♪]

41:26.692 --> 41:29.195
MEGAN:
<i>So this is our hope...</i>

41:29.361 --> 41:31.572
<i>...that we can return to who we were...</i>

41:31.739 --> 41:34.700
<i>...so that we can move forward,</i>
<i>together.</i> <i>While these first steps will be small...</i>

41:37.995 --> 41:40.456
<i>...and sometimes hard to see...</i>

41:40.789 --> 41:42.625
<i>...we promise that this time...</i>

41:43.459 --> 41:46.003
<i>...we'll be there for all of you.</i>

41:46.670 --> 41:48.881
<i>And if we lose our way...</i>

41:49.048 --> 41:51.967
<i>...we also promise</i>
<i>to find our way back.</i>

41:53.344 --> 41:55.679
<i>Because where there is love...</i> <i>...there will always be hope.</i>
