11:35.751 --> 11:40.500

11:35.751 --> 11:40.500

11:40.542 --> 11:42.459
everything from trading

11:40.542 --> 11:42.459

11:42.500 --> 11:44.792

- What?!

21:38.542 --> 21:41.000
- Sir, it's Captain Johnson.

21:42.417 --> 21:44.250
He's becoming impossible.

21:44.292 --> 21:46.417
- And the boy,

21:44.292 --> 21:46.417
have you found him?

21:46.459 --> 21:48.876
- No sir, I--

21:46.459 --> 21:48.876
- Find him!

Emberly: We think he's being

22:03.792 --> 22:05.751
kept in the magazine.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.542
- Let's go get him.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.542
- No, it's not safe yet,

22:07.584 --> 22:09.125
and he'll be well-guarded.

22:09.167 --> 22:10.834
I've brought you food and ale.

22:10.876 --> 22:12.834

22:10.876 --> 22:12.834

22:12.876 --> 22:14.459
Clenna?

She's a friend.

- Does she speak English?

And I demand respect.
