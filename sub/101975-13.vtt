10:24.582 --> 10:25.792
When did this start?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.544
Uh, about an hour ago, maybe more.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.878
We were taking a walk in the park.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.463
-Got it.
-All right,

10:30.547 --> 10:31.673
let's get you in an ER bay.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.009
Nurse Hundley, can you prep Bay Seven?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.010
Prepped and ready.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.220
-You are the best.
-(laughs)

10:37.303 --> 10:38.638
Come with me, Rose.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.681
Take it slow.

10:50.900 --> 10:51.943
Hey, Conrad.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.904
Can I talk to you for a sec?

10:56.281 --> 10:58.199
I need you to cover her for me.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.577
She's your patient.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.412
I know.
I...

11:02.495 --> 11:04.456
I just need to take a minute.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.000
Okay.
You want to talk about it?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.960
Not yet.

11:09.044 --> 11:12.172
Okay.
Do what you got to do.

11:19.637 --> 11:23.391
Dr. Pravesh and I
saw him carry this kid

11:23.475 --> 11:24.601
from the burning building.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.686
He saved a life at great risk to his own.

11:26.770 --> 11:30.523
How many truly selfless people
do you even meet these days?

11:30.607 --> 11:33.109
Not too many.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.028
I'm just saying, fingers crossed

11:35.111 --> 11:38.031
his injuries aren't too serious
and we can fix him.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.742
Dr. Devi, surgery 101:

11:40.825 --> 11:43.286
never let patients get into your heart.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.413
Don't worry about me.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.290
I'm all about self-control.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.125
-(machine beeps)
-That's good to know.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.836
What have we here?

11:51.920 --> 11:54.297
This man is either the luckiest

11:54.381 --> 11:56.633
or unluckiest patient I've ever seen.

11:56.716 --> 12:00.053
Broken rib lodged in the aorta?

12:00.136 --> 12:02.097
That's a one-in-a-million injury.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.599
Exactly.
Most patients with aortic trauma

12:04.683 --> 12:05.809
never even make it to the hospital,

12:05.892 --> 12:07.102
but you see right there?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.436
His broken rib

12:08.520 --> 12:10.772
is actually preventing him
from bleeding out.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.565
We heard the staircase
collapse beneath him.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.651
He got knocked around really bad.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.529
Okay.
So, tell me, how would you fix him?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.618
Approach with a lateral thoracotomy,

12:23.702 --> 12:26.079
clamp it, remove the piece of the rib,
sew up the hole.

12:26.162 --> 12:29.916
Well, sounds like somebody
just gained admission to my OR.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.672
I won't let you down, Dr. Austin.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.340
Good.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.802
Now go prep Mr. Johnson
and do not leave his side.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.679
If he even sneezes wrong,

12:42.762 --> 12:45.348
that rib could dislodge
and he could bleed out.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.978
(door opens)

12:50.061 --> 12:51.688
(phone chimes)

12:51.771 --> 12:53.606
You're getting a lot of text messages.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.984
Is there some secret boyfriend
you're not telling me about?

12:56.067 --> 12:59.571
(scoffs) Yeah, no.
I've got enough on my hands at work.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.198
It's probably just the siren call

13:02.282 --> 13:04.367
of the online shoe stores
I've been consorting with.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.829
Oh, my feet are already a size bigger.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.417
Could be an emergency at work.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.711
Nope.
Not on call.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.796
How are you doing?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.882
(sighs)
I just want to hide.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.760
(chuckles) I mean,
I love that everyone cares so much.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.303
I just...

13:23.386 --> 13:25.638
could use some peace and quiet.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.768
Okay, well, it's too late
to cancel the shower.

13:29.851 --> 13:32.354
-I mean, Kyle would be heartbroken.
-(chuckles)

13:32.437 --> 13:34.230
He's been in on the planning
from the word go.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.316
No, I don't want to cancel.
I'm just venting.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.360
It's very sweet.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.362
And you're right, he is dead set

13:40.445 --> 13:42.238
-on being the best grandpa.
-(chuckles)

13:42.322 --> 13:44.324
(phone vibrating)

13:45.742 --> 13:48.244
Mmm.
Oh, that's good.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.330
(indistinct chatter)

14:03.885 --> 14:05.804
Her incisions are healing nicely.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.305
That's not where the pain is coming from.

14:07.389 --> 14:08.890
GREGG:
She keeps dozing off.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.975
Shouldn't she wake up
when you're examining her?

14:11.059 --> 14:14.396
Well, maybe.
Her abdomen is soft.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.940
The loss of appetite is concerning,

14:17.023 --> 14:18.024
but until she eats, we won't know

14:18.108 --> 14:20.193
how her digestive system is responding.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.903
I could get some Jell-O
from the cafeteria.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.780
JAKE:
It's worth a try.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
Hey, guys.
Just a word.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.456
What's going on?

14:33.540 --> 14:35.792
We just got Sammie's latest labs.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.922
She's showing signs
of kidney and liver failure?

14:41.006 --> 14:42.215
And her lactate is climbing.

14:43.299 --> 14:44.300
GREGG:
What does that mean?

14:44.384 --> 14:46.136
That the-the post-op infection

14:46.219 --> 14:49.222
is taking a toll on her body, and...

14:49.305 --> 14:51.933
and if it continues to get worse, then...

14:52.017 --> 14:55.437
Her long-term prospects are not good.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.232
(exhales)

15:08.533 --> 15:10.535
-Hey.
-ROSE: Dr. Hawkins.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.787
What's the word?
Am I having a sickle cell crisis?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.539
Your chest X-ray looked good.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.583
You're not having a heart attack.

15:16.666 --> 15:20.503
And your CT angioscan was clean,
too, so it's not a blood clot.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.839
But you can't rule out
that I'm not having a sickle cell crisis?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.174
That's good news, Rose.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.675
-Take it.
-CONRAD: We won't

15:25.759 --> 15:27.469
know for certain
about your sickle cell status

15:27.552 --> 15:28.803
until the blood smear comes back.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.640
Every day since
I finished the gene therapy

15:32.724 --> 15:34.684
had been feeling better than my last.

15:34.768 --> 15:38.271
I was walking without pain
and then jogging.

15:38.355 --> 15:40.023
Last week I even taught at the studio.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.566
Now this.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.987
I'm scared.
What if the gene therapy failed?

15:47.489 --> 15:49.741
Look...

15:49.824 --> 15:52.077
You did the right thing coming in,

15:52.160 --> 15:56.414
but there is no reason to go
to the worst-case scenario yet.

15:56.498 --> 15:57.999
Where's Dr. Pravesh?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.460
CONRAD:
The ER is slammed. There was a fire.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.212
-He asked me to step in.
-ROSE: Oh.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.589
I hope everyone's okay.

16:04.673 --> 16:06.591
Thank you, Conrad.

16:06.675 --> 16:08.593
Sure.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.970
Soon as I know more, I'll come right back.

16:16.726 --> 16:20.313
I've signed my life over, Dr. Devi.

16:21.731 --> 16:24.234
But I know I'm in good hands.

16:24.317 --> 16:28.363
Actually, Dr. Austin
is your primary surgeon.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.615
You're in the best hands.

16:31.700 --> 16:33.201
I'm gonna insert an arterial line.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.786
You'll feel a pinch when I insert it.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.955
Yeah, I'm guessing I can survive a pinch

16:37.038 --> 16:39.874
since I've got a rib jammed in my heart.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.211
Y-You're gonna be in the operating room,

16:43.294 --> 16:44.379
though, aren't you?

16:44.462 --> 16:46.840
I'll be assisting Dr. Austin.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.633
Good.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.302
Y-You're my lucky charm, huh?

16:51.386 --> 16:53.221
If you hadn't helped at the fire,

16:53.304 --> 16:55.223
I might not have made it this far.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.603
Excellent.
That was close to painless.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.857
And you are so young to be this talented.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.318
I bet your parents
are really proud of you.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.740
That's half true.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.325
Oh, which one's hard on you?

17:14.409 --> 17:16.327
Mom?

17:16.411 --> 17:19.330
-Dad?
-What we are doing today,

17:19.414 --> 17:21.750
Mr. Johnson, is about you, not about me.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.501
I get it.
I'm nosy.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.297
You can tell me all about it after.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.175
If there is an after, that is.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.843
Because there's a chance

17:31.926 --> 17:34.512
I'm not gonna make it
off the table, right?

17:38.099 --> 17:40.018
All surgery has risks.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.520
This one, more than most.

17:43.605 --> 17:44.773
I'll go over them again with you.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.566
No, thank you.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.735
(chuckles): It's not like
I'm gonna change my mind.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.696
Besides, you and Dr. Austin

17:51.780 --> 17:53.782
will get me through this.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.252
So far, Rose's labs and scans look good.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.171
So it's not a sickle cell crisis.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.174
We're waiting for her blood smear
to come back to be sure.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.968
-I told her to stay put for a bit.
-Okay.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.887
Thanks.
Fingers crossed.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.391
You ready to tell me what's going on?

18:19.474 --> 18:20.433
Why you turfed her to me?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.018
(chuckles softly)

18:22.102 --> 18:24.104
Come here.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.859
I'm not sure myself, honestly.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.653
Look, I care about Rose.

18:31.736 --> 18:32.987
And I'm open about that.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.447
I've been her doctor

18:34.531 --> 18:36.700
from the moment that
she stepped foot into Chastain.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.159
I found her that clinical trial.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.744
I've held her hand
through the worst of it.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.454
I agree.
You've been exemplary.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.832
-Top-notch physician.
-(chuckles softly)

18:43.915 --> 18:47.419
But this morning I saw her
in a coffee shop with Cain.

18:47.502 --> 18:49.254
They were holding hands.

18:49.337 --> 18:52.257
It's obvious they're together.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.759
And I'm feeling...

18:56.761 --> 18:59.347
I don't know.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.435
Jealous.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.103
But to be clear,

19:05.186 --> 19:07.063
I don't want an intimate
relationship with Rose.

19:07.147 --> 19:08.565
She's my patient,

19:08.648 --> 19:11.317
and that is a line
that I'm never gonna cross.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.279
But why is Cain, who we know

19:14.362 --> 19:16.114
is a problematic human being at best,

19:16.197 --> 19:18.033
taking a victory lap with my patient?

19:18.116 --> 19:21.703
I want her healed, okay?
I really do.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.707
But all of a sudden,
you know, I'm feeling...

19:25.790 --> 19:28.335
I'm feeling protective of her,

19:28.418 --> 19:30.837
-which is...
-Yeah, not your job.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.048
Our patients,
when they leave the hospital,

19:33.131 --> 19:34.507
they're gonna do
whatever the hell they want.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.051
And who knows?

19:36.134 --> 19:37.761
Cain's been through a lot.
She's been through a lot.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.970
Maybe they'll be good for each other.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.764
You never know.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.432
Yeah.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.809
-Mm-hmm. You never know.
-I mean,

19:44.893 --> 19:46.770
who would've thought you and Dr. Devi

19:46.853 --> 19:48.146
would be so perfect for each other?

19:48.229 --> 19:50.315
-Oh, get out of here.
-What?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.067
I'm just happy for you guys, man.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.568
-That's never gonna happen.
-(laughs)

19:55.653 --> 19:57.572
You are so cute.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.449
-Oh, my God.
-(knock on door)

19:59.532 --> 20:01.409
Oh. Don't move.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.869
(door opens)

20:02.952 --> 20:04.287
KYLE:
Sorry that took so long.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.206
We had a, uh, kerfuffle

20:06.289 --> 20:08.375
over the color of the streamers.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.001
Welcome back, guys.
Let's put everything

20:10.085 --> 20:11.628
on the dining room table
and see what we got.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.881
Uh, Nic, I learned today that your father

20:14.964 --> 20:17.717
has strong feelings
about the color orange.

20:17.801 --> 20:20.345
Oh, yeah.
That's a thing.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.472
Glad you guys worked it out.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.016
KYLE:
I thought we agreed to not do this.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.143
-(phone vibrates)
-I don't like orange. It scares me.

20:27.227 --> 20:29.437
MARSHALL:
I wasn't making fun of you.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.480
Can you just...?

20:35.402 --> 20:37.320
Is that my phone?
What are you doing?

20:37.404 --> 20:40.281
I heard it buzzing.
It must have fallen out of your pocket.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.784
-You were reading my texts.
-No.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.911
I... Well, I mean, yeah,
they-they popped up.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.706
What... What is going on?

20:47.789 --> 20:50.041
I mean, you've been powering
through the house all day

20:50.125 --> 20:51.292
like if you stopped for one second,

20:51.376 --> 20:52.460
your head's gonna explode.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.004
And, I mean, who is this person?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.505
Who's texting you those things?

Coming through, child. But, hey,

21:03.513 --> 21:06.057
maybe black is the new orange.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.186

The meds should help get blood

21:10.270 --> 21:11.646

21:16.693 --> 21:21.406
No, now we are being here.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.791

21:33.084 --> 21:34.836
No, it-it's okay.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.880
Her belly's rock-hard.

21:36.963 --> 21:41.051
-What does that mean?
-It means she needs an abdominal CT scan right now.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.510

21:47.515 --> 21:49.684

-Oh, what about Rita's dog, Chompsky?

21:56.191 --> 21:57.609
He's a great pup, that one.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.527

22:02.447 --> 22:04.532
All your neighbors are asking
about you as well.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.368
You have a lot of fans.

22:06.451 --> 22:07.494

22:13.708 --> 22:16.503

been completely prepped?

22:16.586 --> 22:18.004
He has.

22:18.088 --> 22:20.048
Informed of the risks
and has consented to the surgery?

22:20.131 --> 22:23.510
Uh, Dr. Devi here
has laid it all out for me.

22:23.593 --> 22:26.304

22:27.389 --> 22:28.765
Excellent.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.558
Well, let's scrub in and get started.

22:34.979 --> 22:37.315

you'll be all fixed up.

22:44.989 --> 22:46.783
Acute mesenteric ischemia.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.412
Yeah. Her hypercoagulable state
must have led to a clot

22:50.495 --> 22:52.288
that compromised blood supply
to her bowels.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.748
This could be fatal.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.959
Well, if I perform an embolectomy quickly

22:56.042 --> 22:57.794
before her gut dies off,
we can give her a chance.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.380
No, no, I don't think her body
can handle another big surgery.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.841
It's our only option...

23:02.924 --> 23:05.468
if we're gonna have any chance
of saving her.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.062
So, what did you get for the baby?

23:16.146 --> 23:20.275
A vacation home in Aspen and an SUV.

23:21.943 --> 23:26.281
Relax. I got her a basket
of ETFs and a trading account.

23:26.364 --> 23:29.242
Almost as useful for a newborn
as an Aspen retreat.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.952
You?

23:31.036 --> 23:33.955
I got her a car seat for that SUV.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.337

Billie, what's going on?

23:40.420 --> 23:41.880

23:45.300 --> 23:48.762
Okay.
Okay, so I told you, right?

23:48.845 --> 23:51.056
When I was 13,

23:51.139 --> 23:53.558
you know, after we lost touch...

23:53.641 --> 23:55.393
that I was raped.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.021
Of course.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.274
Well, I got pregnant.

24:01.358 --> 24:03.568

24:10.450 --> 24:12.035
I didn't want to make it about me.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.495
God, don't even think about that, please.

24:13.578 --> 24:15.580
I...
Honestly, I want to talk about this.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.211
I was so young.

24:21.294 --> 24:23.380
By the time I realized I was pregnant,

24:23.463 --> 24:25.090
I had no options.

24:26.174 --> 24:28.885
I went to live with my aunt
until the birth,

24:28.968 --> 24:31.054
and...

24:31.137 --> 24:33.890
then I gave the baby up for adoption.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.437
That must've been so scary.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.441
It was.

24:46.611 --> 24:49.906
They took him away
right after he was born.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.033
I barely saw him.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.202
A boy.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.501
Yeah.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.006
He's 18 now and wants to meet.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.966
He won't take no for an answer.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.343
You know, the records
are supposed to be closed,

25:10.427 --> 25:12.012
but nothing stays hidden anymore.

25:12.095 --> 25:13.513
So those text messages...

25:13.596 --> 25:15.265

25:27.736 --> 25:30.155

Of course.

25:32.574 --> 25:35.201

25:38.496 --> 25:41.416
what he's doing with his life, and...

25:44.961 --> 25:47.756
But he's the product of something awful.

25:47.839 --> 25:51.009
Something I have worked
very hard to put behind me.

25:51.092 --> 25:54.304
It's not his fault, but it's the truth.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.267
