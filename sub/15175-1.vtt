WEBVTT

04:21.471 --> 04:22.471
You can leave now.

04:25.058 --> 04:26.058
Now!

04:42.242 --> 04:43.451
My name is Dr. Bloom.

04:45.036 --> 04:46.287
You can call me Henry.

04:47.247 --> 04:48.789
Or, if you would feel more comfortable,

04:48.790 --> 04:50.124
you can just call me Doc.

04:52.085 --> 04:54.003
Fuck off, Doc.

04:58.424 --> 04:59.968
I'm not one for games, Ricky.

05:01.135 --> 05:02.220
I'm a professional.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.431
My time is very valuable.

05:08.977 --> 05:11.187
Oh, and mine isn't?

05:14.524 --> 05:18.069
Your time is running out, son.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.364
I'm your last chance.

05:22.573 --> 05:24.157
Yeah?

05:24.158 --> 05:25.158
Yeah.

05:26.869 --> 05:27.995
Well what makes you think you can

05:27.996 --> 05:31.331
bullshit your way into
my head like every other

05:31.332 --> 05:33.084
pencil-necked piece of shit?

05:34.252 --> 05:35.670
I told you to get out!

05:58.318 --> 05:59.318
Sit down, Ricky.

06:12.332 --> 06:13.708
Let's get something straight.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.670
I will ask the questions.

06:18.755 --> 06:20.922
You will answer them.

06:20.923 --> 06:21.923
You will talk.

06:23.593 --> 06:24.593
I will listen.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.055
But then you know that.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.682
I'm not the first
psychiatrist you've seen.

06:30.683 --> 06:31.892
No kiddin'.

06:31.893 --> 06:32.893
Fine.

06:35.355 --> 06:37.231
Then let's get started.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.237
I need to ask you something.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.364
Shoot.

06:45.365 --> 06:46.365
It's your dime.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.161
It's my dime.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.748
Who killed your parents?

06:57.168 --> 06:58.336
You really wanna know?

07:00.171 --> 07:01.923
Who, Ricky?

07:04.175 --> 07:05.175
Who did it?

07:09.263 --> 07:10.263
Santa Claus.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.771
It was Christmas Eve.

07:22.235 --> 07:24.946
I was just a baby, and
Billy was only seven.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.907
But he knew all about Santa Claus.

07:28.866 --> 07:33.161
Mom, what time is it?

07:33.162 --> 07:34.955
It's almost 4:30, honey.

07:34.956 --> 07:37.541
We're gonna be at Grandpa's pretty soon.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.418
What time does Santa Claus come?

07:39.419 --> 07:42.212
Not until everyone
is asleep in bed, honey.

07:42.213 --> 07:44.089
Can't I stay up and see him?

07:44.090 --> 07:46.466
I wouldn't if I were you.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.010
It's naughty to stay up past your bedtime.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.471
What if we don't get home by my bedtime?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.890
We will, hon, don't worry.

07:53.891 --> 07:57.644
Santa Claus is gonna bring
you a big surprise tonight.

07:57.645 --> 07:58.980
You just wait and see.

08:03.776 --> 08:06.320
It was night by the
time we reached that turnoff.

08:16.456 --> 08:17.999
I don't know what made him stop.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.417
What's that?

08:20.418 --> 08:21.251
Hmm?

08:21.252 --> 08:23.753
Actually, I do
know what made him stop.

08:23.754 --> 08:26.006
There it is again, see?

08:26.007 --> 08:28.216
There's something
up there, all right.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.718
Do you see what I see?

08:29.719 --> 08:30.552
Billy was there.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.136
You think we should wake up Billy?

08:32.138 --> 08:34.097
Billy told me everything.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.557
Santa Claus!

08:35.558 --> 08:40.270
Looks like you get to see
him tonight after all, Billy.

08:41.147 --> 08:42.563
Need a ride, Santa Claus?

08:42.565 --> 08:44.274
Oh no, not exactly.

08:44.275 --> 08:46.860
Jim, go!

09:35.910 --> 09:36.910
Oh, yeah?

09:37.745 --> 09:38.788
Gonna hit me?

09:46.587 --> 09:47.587
Shoot.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.299
Ho, ho, ho.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.844
It was him, jolly Saint Nick

09:54.845 --> 09:56.054
with a knife in his hand.

09:56.055 --> 09:58.182
Where are
you, you little bastard?

10:04.939 --> 10:05.939
Bastard.

10:07.692 --> 10:09.360
He left us out there to die.

10:13.948 --> 10:15.241
That was a long time ago.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.120
How could you possibly remember all that?

10:20.413 --> 10:24.125
Because I was there.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.800
You know, I don't like
your attitude, Bloom.

10:35.136 --> 10:38.806
My attitude is not
the issue, Mr. Caldwell.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.060
Oh, I forgot.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.108
You in a hurry, Doc?

10:50.109 --> 10:52.653
Am I wasting your valuable time?

10:59.118 --> 11:01.662
Tell me about your stay
at Saint Mary's orphanage.

11:05.583 --> 11:07.752
I hated that fucking place.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.298
It was rough on both of us.

11:13.758 --> 11:16.217
And Christmastime was always the worst.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.762
All right, now, who's next?

11:17.970 --> 11:19.930
We haven't seen your drawing yet, have we?

11:21.265 --> 11:25.435
It didn't exactly
bring out the best in Billy.

11:25.436 --> 11:26.437
Billy, Billy.

11:28.189 --> 11:29.022
Okay.

11:29.023 --> 11:30.190
Come on up here.

11:30.191 --> 11:32.526
Put your drawing up on
the board with the others.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.280
You put it in place, and
I'll put the tape on it.

11:38.491 --> 11:39.700
Sister, look.

11:41.327 --> 11:43.454
Billy, take that down.

11:48.918 --> 11:50.086
Explain this, William.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.754
I'm sorry, Mother Superior.

11:52.755 --> 11:53.755
Are you?

11:55.174 --> 11:56.675
I don't think so.

11:56.676 --> 11:57.884
But you will be.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.303
You will learn what it is to be sorry.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.388
Now go to your room and stay there.

12:01.389 --> 12:02.973
Yes, Mother Superior.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.144
Until I tell you to come out.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.484
You finally have what you've

12:14.485 --> 12:16.278
been asking for, Mother Superior.

12:17.363 --> 12:18.363
Proof.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.490
Of what, Sister Margaret?

12:20.491 --> 12:22.450
Of what I've been saying.

12:22.451 --> 12:24.744
That it's all still inside him.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.037
Simply because something

12:26.038 --> 12:27.914
unfortunate happened to his parents,

12:27.915 --> 12:30.083
which he knows nothing about,

12:30.084 --> 12:32.752
is no reason to allow him to run wild.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.963
He must be taught.

12:34.964 --> 12:36.048
Good day, Sister.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.636
Good day, Mother Superior.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.659
I think you've been locked
away up here long enough.

13:04.660 --> 13:06.202
Why don't you come out and
help us build our snowman?

13:06.203 --> 13:07.455
I can't.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.750
Look, Billy, Mother Superior

13:11.751 --> 13:13.294
only wants what's best for you.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.920
And I think what's best for you is to come

13:15.921 --> 13:18.007
out and play with the
other children, okay?

13:20.634 --> 13:21.468
Hmm?

13:21.469 --> 13:22.469
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:43.968 --> 14:46.135
You filthy devil!

14:46.136 --> 14:47.971
You'll pay for this.

14:47.972 --> 14:49.681
Punishment.

14:49.682 --> 14:52.141
You devil, take your punishment.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.602
Devil!

14:54.603 --> 14:57.230
How dare you!
Please.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.231
William!

15:01.819 --> 15:03.152
Don't blame him, Mother Superior,

15:03.153 --> 15:04.112
I told him he could come out.

15:04.113 --> 15:06.114
Stay out of this, Sister Margaret.

15:06.115 --> 15:07.116
William, come here.

15:08.534 --> 15:09.909
Billy, what's wrong?

15:09.910 --> 15:12.036
Your brother's a nutcase,
that's what's wrong.

15:12.037 --> 15:12.871
No, he's not!

15:12.872 --> 15:13.705
Take it back!

15:13.706 --> 15:14.539
Boys.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.291
What did you see upstairs, William?

15:16.292 --> 15:17.876
Nothing, Mother Superior.

15:17.877 --> 15:22.130
What they were doing was
something very, very naughty.

15:22.131 --> 15:25.550
They thought they could do
it without being caught.

15:25.551 --> 15:29.054
But when we do something
naughty, we are always caught.

15:30.347 --> 15:31.557
And then we are punished.

15:32.933 --> 15:35.059
Punishment is absolute.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.644
Punishment is good.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.938
Yes, Mother Superior.

15:40.399 --> 15:41.859
You left your room, William.

15:42.902 --> 15:44.777
Yes, Mother Superior.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.488
Very, very naughty.

15:56.081 --> 16:01.045
She was naughty.

16:19.772 --> 16:21.189
Do you miss your brother?

16:21.190 --> 16:22.815
What do you think?

16:22.816 --> 16:24.609
You felt sorry for him.

16:24.610 --> 16:25.485
Why?

16:25.486 --> 16:27.820
I feel sorry for you.

16:27.821 --> 16:28.821
You do?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.198
Yeah.

16:30.199 --> 16:33.494
You're shrink number 13.

16:34.787 --> 16:35.787
Good.

16:36.705 --> 16:37.831
That's my lucky number.

16:43.587 --> 16:44.587
Do you dream, Ricky?

16:46.882 --> 16:48.884
I don't sleep.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.722
But Billy had dreams, bad dreams.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.559
Every day I'd hear about 'em.

16:59.645 --> 17:01.771
But every night he'd live 'em.

17:16.744 --> 17:17.704
Please let me up.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.580
Mother Superior
had a thing about discipline.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.917
- Sister Margaret.
- What was naughty

17:24.294 --> 17:25.420
and what wasn't.

17:25.421 --> 17:27.255
- Let me out.
- Leave him alone.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.966
Let me out of here.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.804
Let me out of here.

17:35.055 --> 17:35.972
Let me up.

17:35.973 --> 17:36.973
Let me up!

17:40.894 --> 17:42.478
Let me out of here!

17:42.479 --> 17:43.479
Please.

17:45.524 --> 17:46.524
Help.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.737
Sister Margaret?

17:50.738 --> 17:52.363
But on Christmas day.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.616
- No!
- It all went straight to hell

17:55.617 --> 17:56.660
No, no, no!

17:58.078 --> 17:59.872
Oh, no, no!
Ginny, out of the way.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.333
You will learn gratitude.

18:04.334 --> 18:05.752
Say thank you to Santa Claus.

18:05.753 --> 18:06.795
No, no, no!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.969
Billy, Billy!

18:19.558 --> 18:20.767
I'm sorry.

18:20.768 --> 18:22.102
I didn't mean to be naughty.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.397
Don't punish me, please.

18:28.776 --> 18:29.776
William.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.529
No one heard him screaming.

18:33.822 --> 18:34.822
But I did.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.638
New tape.

19:14.279 --> 19:16.114
What do you see out there?

19:16.115 --> 19:17.115
Bars.

19:21.870 --> 19:22.954
Let's jump ahead.

19:22.955 --> 19:23.955
Let's.

19:23.956 --> 19:26.374
Your brother eventually
left the orphanage.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.208
Yeah.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.209
Left you alone.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.087
He didn't leave me.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.089
He was 18.

19:35.926 --> 19:40.347
Mother Superior got him a
job at the local toy store.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.724
That's very good.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.393
Very realistic.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.686
Isn't it, Mrs. Randall?

19:46.687 --> 19:48.897
He's definitely fat and jolly.

19:50.107 --> 19:52.900
Take a closer look at
yourself in the mirror, Billy.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.153
- Picture that.
- Now just remember,

19:55.154 --> 19:57.864
lots of ho, ho, ho.

19:57.865 --> 20:00.575
And try not to scare the little bastards.

20:00.576 --> 20:02.910
I guess they think the old guy is scary.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.745
Silly, isn't it?

20:04.746 --> 20:06.039
Silly.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.963
Stop it.

20:13.964 --> 20:15.673
Please, stop it.

20:15.674 --> 20:17.675
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

20:17.676 --> 20:19.051
You're being naughty.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.929
I don't bring toys to naughty children.

20:22.347 --> 20:25.184
I punish them severely.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.520
He sure knows how to handle kids.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.772
He's great, isn't he?

22:15.627 --> 22:16.627
Oh, stop it.

22:19.256 --> 22:20.589
Come on.

22:20.590 --> 22:22.134
Come on, don't do that, Andy.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.094
Andy.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.012
Uh-uh.

22:26.013 --> 22:28.306
No, don't do that.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.100
Come on, let's go back now.

22:31.476 --> 22:33.061
Andy, stop it!

22:34.187 --> 22:35.564
Please, Andy, no!

22:46.199 --> 22:47.199
No!

22:51.997 --> 22:53.123
You bastard.

22:55.584 --> 22:56.584
Naughty!

23:13.477 --> 23:15.603
Bastard, you're crazy.

23:15.604 --> 23:17.229
Get the hell away from me!

23:24.196 --> 23:25.905
Did you hear something?

23:25.906 --> 23:27.531
I didn't hear anything, Mr. Simms.

23:27.532 --> 23:30.160
Must have been your imagination.

23:31.620 --> 23:35.749
Punishment is good!

23:36.666 --> 23:39.668
I heard something, by God.

23:39.669 --> 23:40.669
No.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.259
Anybody in here?

24:01.233 --> 24:02.233
Mr. Simms!

24:10.450 --> 24:11.450
Mr. Simms!

24:13.912 --> 24:15.913
Come out here and see this.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.082
This is lovely.

24:20.961 --> 24:23.839
Mr. Simms, are you hiding in there?

24:45.193 --> 24:46.527
Answer.

24:46.528 --> 24:47.361
Operator.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.362
Thank God.

25:25.942 --> 25:26.985
No!

25:31.239 --> 25:32.699
But it wasn't his fault.

25:34.951 --> 25:35.951
It couldn't be.

25:38.538 --> 25:39.831
Then whose fault was it?

25:43.793 --> 25:45.962
It was that bitch Superior.

25:47.506 --> 25:48.964
She made him do it.

25:48.965 --> 25:51.258
Was Billy being naughty?

25:51.259 --> 25:52.259
No.

25:54.429 --> 25:55.429
They were naughty.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.892
He punished the bad ones.

25:59.893 --> 26:02.061
How did he know
who the bad ones were?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.146
He didn't have to look very far.

26:04.147 --> 26:05.523
Oh, shit.

26:05.524 --> 26:06.524
What?

26:07.192 --> 26:08.025
Sorry, Tommy.

26:08.026 --> 26:09.985
I gotta go upstairs for a minute.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.153
What for?

26:11.154 --> 26:13.031
Um, the cat wants to come inside.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.325
How do you know?

26:16.326 --> 26:18.370
I heard her collar jingling at the door.

26:21.873 --> 26:22.916
Uh.

26:41.518 --> 26:43.435
There you are, you bad kitty.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.729
Punish!

26:59.035 --> 27:00.077
What are you doing?

27:00.078 --> 27:01.078
No, no!

27:05.667 --> 27:07.043
Punish, punish.

27:22.892 --> 27:23.892
Holy shit.

27:27.480 --> 27:28.480
Denise?

27:29.566 --> 27:30.609
Are you okay?

27:35.572 --> 27:37.657
If this is some kind of
joke, I'm gonna kill her.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.182
- Operator.
- Operator!

28:03.558 --> 28:05.059
Operator, I need the police.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.061
Dial 911 for emergency.

28:07.062 --> 28:08.688
Sir, is this a joke?

28:11.274 --> 28:12.274
Punish.

28:25.705 --> 28:26.705
Punish.

28:31.461 --> 28:33.545
But the others were innocent.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.216
Oh, no, they deserved it.

28:37.384 --> 28:38.802
But no one understood.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.263
Not even the police.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.392
Can you believe this?

28:46.393 --> 28:48.435
It's Christmas eve, and we got orders

28:48.436 --> 28:49.854
to bring in Santa Claus.

28:51.773 --> 28:52.773
Hey, look.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.869
What are you doing?

29:05.870 --> 29:08.373
What do you think you're doing?

29:12.293 --> 29:13.127
Hold it!

29:13.128 --> 29:14.461
Stop right there!

29:14.462 --> 29:15.462
Daddy.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.257
Daddy?

29:20.135 --> 29:23.054
Daddy almost
got his present early.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.517
But Billy was miles away.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.396
It was something to see.

29:32.564 --> 29:36.525
Cops stopping every Santa
between here and the state line.

29:39.821 --> 29:41.364
But that didn't matter to Billy.

29:42.615 --> 29:45.243
He knew the roads, the shortcuts.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.413
He knew exactly where he was going.

29:50.081 --> 29:51.583
And nothing was gonna stop him.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.212
At least not for long.

30:00.550 --> 30:01.383
Look at this hill.

30:01.384 --> 30:02.217
Virgin, man.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.887
The only kind you'll ever get.

30:04.888 --> 30:06.014
I'm going down first.

30:11.186 --> 30:13.228
What's the matter, you afraid?

30:13.229 --> 30:14.397
Be quiet for a minute.

30:15.732 --> 30:17.484
I feel like somebody's watching me.

30:18.735 --> 30:19.735
Like who?

30:22.947 --> 30:25.283
Well, if it isn't Bob and Mack.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.245
Now why don't you guys just
get the fuck out of the way?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.084
Glad to, little man.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.379
But, uh, we're gonna go sledding.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.590
Oh, that's the plan.

30:41.591 --> 30:42.591
Yeah.

30:49.057 --> 30:50.557
All right, all right.

30:50.558 --> 30:51.558
I'm sorry.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.855
Now get outta here!

30:57.148 --> 30:58.691
- Come on.
- Go on, get out of here.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.360
Yeah.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.946
- All right.
- All right, let's go.

31:03.947 --> 31:04.947
You go first.

31:05.698 --> 31:06.698
Oh, okay.

31:12.455 --> 31:14.873
Hey, what if I hit a tree?

31:14.874 --> 31:15.874
Just go.

31:19.379 --> 31:20.379
Yeah.

31:34.310 --> 31:35.561
All right.

31:35.562 --> 31:36.563
Now watch this.

31:56.165 --> 31:57.833
Oh, God!

31:57.834 --> 31:59.502
Billy hated bullies.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.800
But he was starting to
leave a bloody trail.

32:06.801 --> 32:07.969
Three more murders.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.597
I'm alerting my men all night.

32:12.974 --> 32:17.937
Kid may be nuts, but he's not stupid.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.732
There oughta be a way we
can predict his next move.

32:21.733 --> 32:22.733
Oh, my Lord.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.778
Sister Margaret had it all figured out.

32:26.863 --> 32:28.323
She always knew the score.

32:30.450 --> 32:33.327
But Mother Superior called the shots.

32:33.328 --> 32:35.330
It's fairly obvious where he was going.

32:36.372 --> 32:37.915
Really?

32:37.916 --> 32:40.667
Well, maybe we're just
jerking off here then.

32:40.668 --> 32:41.710
Huh?

32:41.711 --> 32:42.711
If you say so.

32:46.257 --> 32:50.511
You're good, Doc, but
I know all the moves.

32:52.305 --> 32:54.182
I could squash you like a bug.

32:56.768 --> 32:57.769
You don't scare me.

32:59.562 --> 33:00.562
Not yet.

33:05.610 --> 33:09.321
I want those papers folded and stacked.

33:09.322 --> 33:11.365
And I want each one of you to write a nice

33:11.366 --> 33:14.868
thank you to Santa for his visit later.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.000
If any of you get wet or start

33:22.001 --> 33:24.545
to feel cold, come back inside.

33:32.303 --> 33:33.303
Wow.

33:35.098 --> 33:35.973
Cut it out!

33:35.974 --> 33:38.184
Don't you see who's coming?

33:39.769 --> 33:40.769
Hey, Billy!

33:41.896 --> 33:42.896
Billy?

33:46.234 --> 33:47.359
This is Officer Barnes.

33:47.360 --> 33:50.154
I'm approaching the orphanage now.

33:51.572 --> 33:52.572
Shit!

33:57.662 --> 33:58.662
Hey, hold it!

33:58.663 --> 34:00.747
Don't take another step or I'll shoot!

34:00.748 --> 34:01.665
- Billy.
- Get out of there,

34:01.666 --> 34:02.541
get away from him!

34:02.542 --> 34:07.005
Billy.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.716
Oh, my God.

34:10.717 --> 34:12.384
Children, inside!

34:12.385 --> 34:13.342
Hurry!
Santa.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.304
- What happened?
- Ricky!

34:17.348 --> 34:19.058
Come away from there.

34:23.855 --> 34:24.897
One problem.

34:25.982 --> 34:26.983
It wasn't Billy.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.237
It was old man Kelsey, the janitor.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.158
Poor, deaf son of a bitch.

34:36.868 --> 34:39.536
Mother Superior was pretty pissed off.

34:40.705 --> 34:43.166
I guess the cop kind of
felt bad about it too.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.043
I couldn't give a shit.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.047
I knew Billy'd take care of him.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.090
He was dressed as a Santa Claus.

34:52.091 --> 34:53.341
I'm sorry for what happened,

34:53.342 --> 34:55.303
but there is a killer on the way here.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.140
Oh, the children.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.224
No harm must come to the children.

35:01.225 --> 35:02.350
Do you understand?

35:02.351 --> 35:03.894
That's why I'm here, Sister.

35:03.895 --> 35:05.812
I am Mother Superior.

35:05.813 --> 35:09.066
And so far, all you have done is harm.

35:09.067 --> 35:10.108
I'm gonna check out the grounds.

35:10.109 --> 35:11.651
In the meantime, you make sure everyone

35:11.652 --> 35:12.944
stays locked up inside.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.989
Don't let anybody come in unless
you know exactly who it is.

35:15.990 --> 35:19.327
No one is going to get in
that doesn't belong here.

36:54.422 --> 36:55.422
Punish.

37:19.697 --> 37:22.992
Poor things, they're scared to death.

37:25.995 --> 37:26.995
Oh, yes.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.791
They need something to
keep their mind off it.

37:32.043 --> 37:33.418
We're gonna sing.

37:33.419 --> 37:34.586
Ready, Sister?

37:34.587 --> 37:35.754
Deck the Halls.

37:35.755 --> 37:37.297
Andrew, where do you think you're going?

37:37.298 --> 37:38.466
Come on, we need altos.

37:42.637 --> 37:43.637
No, don't!

37:44.388 --> 37:45.847
It's Santa.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.515
Chrissie, stay away!

37:47.516 --> 37:49.226
But Mother Superior...

37:49.227 --> 37:50.060
Chrissie.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.478
It's Santa Claus.

37:51.479 --> 37:52.563
Stay away from him.

37:54.398 --> 37:55.398
Come here.

37:56.150 --> 37:57.151
Andrew, come here.

38:04.200 --> 38:06.201
There's no Santa Claus.

38:06.202 --> 38:07.619
Naughty.

38:07.620 --> 38:10.330
There is no Santa Claus.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.165
Naughty, naughty

38:12.166 --> 38:14.000
There is no Santa Claus!

38:14.001 --> 38:18.965
Naughty!

38:43.447 --> 38:45.449
You're safe now.

38:46.826 --> 38:48.411
Santa Claus is gone.

39:26.115 --> 39:27.115
Naughty.

39:29.827 --> 39:31.037
Very naughty.

39:39.378 --> 39:42.757
So, this is me, huh?

39:51.891 --> 39:53.809
They closed the orphanage after that.

39:54.894 --> 39:56.811
You bet.

39:56.812 --> 40:00.149
But kindly Sister Mary was
able to find me a family.

40:01.525 --> 40:02.735
The Rosenbergs.

40:09.533 --> 40:12.828
They definitely did not get
involved with Christmas.

40:23.047 --> 40:26.759
The sister gave them my background.

40:28.052 --> 40:29.345
And they treated me okay.

40:34.517 --> 40:37.685
I was finally able to act like a kid.

40:37.686 --> 40:40.523
Not some freak show with
a killer for a brother.

40:42.149 --> 40:43.149
It wasn't bad.

40:44.110 --> 40:45.944
Hell, what did I know?

40:45.945 --> 40:46.945
I was 12 years old.

41:03.921 --> 41:05.839
- Martha, Martha.
- Oh, Jill.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.257
Hi.
How are you?

41:07.258 --> 41:08.216
Oh, good to see you.

41:08.217 --> 41:10.760
Ricky, stay right there, okay?

41:10.761 --> 41:11.845
Oh, I'm so glad I ran into you,

41:11.846 --> 41:14.389
I wanted to know all about...

41:22.857 --> 41:24.775
- Mom.
- Just a second, honey.

41:30.281 --> 41:31.489
Mom.

41:31.490 --> 41:35.703
Ricky, darling, Mommy is talking.

41:40.249 --> 41:41.583
Mom, look.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.461
What is it, sweetheart?

41:52.094 --> 41:55.013
I don't know what is wrong.
Oh, that's okay.

41:55.014 --> 41:56.807
So anyway.

42:04.857 --> 42:06.608
Well good afternoon, Sisters.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.486
I'll be right with you.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.169
Jill, hold this.

42:29.840 --> 42:30.840
Oh, my God.

42:37.681 --> 42:38.681
Need to go.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.601
You've got to
understand the situation.

42:41.602 --> 42:43.144
Understand?

42:43.145 --> 42:46.231
The boy, he had some kind of a seizure.

42:46.232 --> 42:47.815
This is not normal.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.526
I was afraid
they'd send me back.

42:49.527 --> 42:51.069
Morty, Morty, you didn't see it.

42:51.070 --> 42:52.403
You don't know, you weren't there.

42:52.404 --> 42:55.281
- Yeah, but he's my son.
- Crazy kid and all that.

42:55.282 --> 42:57.534
I'd like to know
what the hell is going on here!

42:57.535 --> 42:59.285
If I may make a suggestion...

42:59.286 --> 43:00.995
But Sister Mary
straightened things out.

43:00.996 --> 43:03.706
And pretty soon, the
whole thing was forgotten.

43:03.707 --> 43:06.543
Mother Superior has assured me

43:06.544 --> 43:08.962
that his behavior will improve once

43:08.963 --> 43:11.131
he has a stable family environment.

43:17.638 --> 43:19.848
Morty, he needs us.

43:23.477 --> 43:25.103
Come on, honey.

43:25.104 --> 43:27.356
I'd like to spend some time with him.

43:35.030 --> 43:38.242
It was about five years
later that my stepdad died.

43:41.161 --> 43:42.161
And guess what?

43:44.206 --> 43:45.332
That hit me pretty hard.

44:03.225 --> 44:05.143
The Rosenbergs had always been good to me.

44:05.144 --> 44:07.229
And I knew what she was going through.

44:08.147 --> 44:09.147
All alone.

44:18.741 --> 44:21.785
After the funeral, I needed some time.

44:27.833 --> 44:29.126
I felt like running away.

44:33.380 --> 44:35.674
I've never told anybody this before.

44:36.925 --> 44:37.925
Let it out.

44:39.261 --> 44:40.261
Here it comes.

44:43.932 --> 44:46.727
I used to walk for hours
on those back roads.

44:49.438 --> 44:50.689
No one was close.

44:52.650 --> 44:53.817
No one to lose.

44:56.111 --> 44:59.156
You tend to get paranoid when
everyone around you gets dead.

45:02.785 --> 45:03.785
That's life.

45:47.329 --> 45:50.123
It doesn't really work that way.

45:50.124 --> 45:51.374
Is that cold?

46:03.178 --> 46:04.638
You're gonna need a new shirt.

46:06.515 --> 46:07.515
Why?

46:08.600 --> 46:09.852
What do you mean?

46:10.728 --> 46:13.439
I mean, I see something I like.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.734
Eddie, you are such a pig.

46:18.610 --> 46:19.610
Yeah.

46:23.991 --> 46:26.160
That's what you like about me, ain't it?

46:36.044 --> 46:37.044
Now say it.

46:38.172 --> 46:39.756
Say what?

46:39.757 --> 46:40.882
You know.

46:40.883 --> 46:42.049
Tell me you want it.

46:42.050 --> 46:43.092
Eddie.

46:43.093 --> 46:46.138
Look, if you don't tell me
you want it, you can't have it.

46:47.514 --> 46:48.557
I do want it.

46:50.893 --> 46:51.893
But not right now.

46:54.438 --> 46:56.356
You're always in such a hurry with me.

46:57.608 --> 46:58.775
Yeah, so what?

46:58.776 --> 47:01.737
So maybe I'm tired of
you always grabbing at me.

47:02.988 --> 47:05.032
With your friends, it's real funny.

47:05.949 --> 47:07.533
But not right now.

47:07.534 --> 47:09.327
So leave me alone.

47:09.328 --> 47:10.328
Come on.

47:10.329 --> 47:13.748
Eddie!

47:13.749 --> 47:14.791
This will be fun.

47:14.792 --> 47:15.792
Eddie.

47:16.543 --> 47:17.752
Ain't this exciting?

47:17.753 --> 47:20.964
Goddamn it, Eddie, stop it!

47:36.230 --> 47:37.230
Naughty.

47:44.029 --> 47:45.029
Fuck this.

47:46.698 --> 47:47.657
I'm gettin' a beer.

47:47.658 --> 47:49.326
Then I'll be back.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.122
You're an asshole, Eddie!

49:33.347 --> 49:34.347
Thank you.

50:10.592 --> 50:12.386
Going too fast for you, Doc?

50:15.347 --> 50:16.556
Red car.

50:17.641 --> 50:18.641
Good point.

50:26.984 --> 50:28.986
You got any kids, Doc?

50:31.738 --> 50:34.365
No, we were never blessed with children.

50:34.366 --> 50:36.076
Married, then, huh?

50:39.204 --> 50:42.457
Yes, but my wife has
been dead many years.

50:46.753 --> 50:48.546
Too bad.

50:48.547 --> 50:49.797
How'd you meet her?

50:49.798 --> 50:51.215
In college.

50:51.216 --> 50:52.508
And that's none of your business.

50:52.509 --> 50:55.554
My old lady couldn't
afford to send me to college.

50:57.556 --> 50:59.099
So I got a job.

51:02.352 --> 51:03.478
I was 18.

51:05.355 --> 51:07.398
Washing dishes, dumping trash.

51:07.399 --> 51:08.608
That kind of shit.

51:09.943 --> 51:12.029
At the Chez Ritz across town.

51:13.030 --> 51:14.030
Rocco!

51:16.908 --> 51:20.454
- I think you'll enjoy this.
- Come on, Rocco.

51:23.498 --> 51:25.041
It sounded like some squirrel

51:25.042 --> 51:27.043
getting its nuts squeezed.

51:27.044 --> 51:29.462
- Rocco, let's talk.
- No.

51:29.463 --> 51:31.756
Rocco, it's just between the two of us.

51:31.757 --> 51:32.631
No.

51:32.632 --> 51:35.301
Rocco, come on, we go way back!

51:35.302 --> 51:37.636
Monday, I swear, I'll
pay it all on Monday.

51:37.637 --> 51:40.097
You won't live until Monday.

51:43.810 --> 51:45.394
Listen, listen, I got a line on something.

51:45.395 --> 51:46.228
I can feel it.

51:46.229 --> 51:47.063
It's gonna happen.

51:47.064 --> 51:48.981
Hey, you know what?

51:48.982 --> 51:49.982
What?

51:54.946 --> 51:57.616
I hope you don't pay on Monday.

52:05.082 --> 52:06.917
'Cause I enjoy this too much.

52:43.662 --> 52:45.080
What are you looking at, kid?

52:46.748 --> 52:47.874
Get out of my way.

52:50.877 --> 52:51.877
Ooh.

52:53.463 --> 52:55.757
You're really asking for it.

53:36.965 --> 53:37.965
Naughty.

54:34.397 --> 54:35.815
What in the hell?

54:36.691 --> 54:39.277
I see no mention of these
two incidents in my notes.

54:40.779 --> 54:41.779
Oh, my God.

54:43.782 --> 54:45.241
The state review board will certainly

54:45.242 --> 54:47.035
find out my opinions on...

54:57.754 --> 54:59.380
Well, you didn't think

54:59.381 --> 55:00.464
we've covered a lot of ground today.-

55:00.465 --> 55:02.299
I was gonna let him get away with it?

55:02.300 --> 55:03.133
Much more than

55:03.134 --> 55:05.303
I had anticipated.
Did you, Doc?

55:08.265 --> 55:10.057
No way!

55:10.058 --> 55:12.269
Too many people get away
with shit like that.

55:17.524 --> 55:18.941
Punishment.

55:18.942 --> 55:19.942
Discipline.

55:22.487 --> 55:24.572
You're really starting
to get to me, Doc.

55:25.573 --> 55:27.492
You're getting real close.

55:29.869 --> 55:31.329
Then tell me about Jennifer.

55:33.331 --> 55:34.457
Eat shit.

55:44.968 --> 55:48.221
Richard, do you know why you are here?

55:49.889 --> 55:51.432
No, Doc.

55:51.433 --> 55:52.433
Tell me.

55:53.560 --> 55:55.561
No, you tell me.

55:55.562 --> 55:57.939
I'm finished talking, Henry.

56:08.408 --> 56:10.201
Who is this?

56:19.627 --> 56:20.627
Jennifer.

56:22.672 --> 56:24.632
She's the only thing I ever cared about.

56:30.180 --> 56:33.933
One day we just bumped into each other.

57:07.342 --> 57:08.885
She was a knockout.

57:14.307 --> 57:16.518
I never wanted to lose her.

59:04.125 --> 59:06.002
That was my first time.

59:08.630 --> 59:11.758
I thought it was Jennifer's too.

59:18.014 --> 59:19.723
Chaos.

59:19.724 --> 59:22.769
The motion picture
you've been waiting for.

59:24.312 --> 59:28.775
More action, more violence,
more death and destruction

59:29.776 --> 59:33.153
than any film ever seen before.

59:33.154 --> 59:34.655
You like this stuff?

59:34.656 --> 59:35.990
- Chaos!
- Huh?

59:38.868 --> 59:40.744
This movie's supposed to be scary.

59:40.745 --> 59:42.621
When's it start?

59:42.622 --> 59:43.747
Soon.

59:43.748 --> 59:46.042
Let's go, start the movie!

59:46.960 --> 59:49.795
Movie, movie!
Oh, great.

59:49.796 --> 59:52.714
We have to listen to that for two hours?

59:52.715 --> 59:54.384
It's okay, it's starting.

59:56.970 --> 01:00:00.347
♪ Dun dun dun dun ♪

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:05.060
♪ Dun dun ♪

01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:06.938
♪ Dun ♪

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.818
You got a problem, pal?

01:00:12.819 --> 01:00:13.903
See what I mean?

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:22.661
Yeah.

01:00:34.424 --> 01:00:37.468
You know, I really like you, Ricky.

01:00:38.803 --> 01:00:40.179
You're different.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.725
I don't know what it is.

01:00:44.726 --> 01:00:45.559
I just...

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:46.769
Yeah, I know.

01:00:49.439 --> 01:00:50.439
Me too.

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:00.073
Go ahead, studly.

01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:01.242
Kiss her, ha!

01:01:06.164 --> 01:01:07.831
I knew it.

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:08.832
Faggot!

01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:12.962
Well, we know that's not true.

01:01:14.464 --> 01:01:16.715
And though you may
cross your chest with objects

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:18.925
to ward away all the devils that man

01:01:18.926 --> 01:01:20.802
has ever targeted him with.

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.721
For each of us is the gateway to heaven.

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:24.681
What did you say this movie was about?

01:01:24.682 --> 01:01:26.016
Oh, it's great.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:27.225
It's about this guy who dresses up

01:01:27.226 --> 01:01:29.603
like Santa Claus and kills people.

01:01:29.604 --> 01:01:30.604
What?

01:01:31.397 --> 01:01:33.190
I'm holding you up, asshole!

01:01:38.029 --> 01:01:39.029
Punish.

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:42.575
Ricky, wait.

01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:48.831
31 bucks, Merry Christmas.

01:02:03.096 --> 01:02:04.930
Guess who?

01:02:04.931 --> 01:02:05.889
Chip.

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:06.890
Yuck.

01:02:08.434 --> 01:02:10.310
You haven't returned my calls, babe.

01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:11.436
Imagine that.

01:02:11.437 --> 01:02:13.230
Want a ride or not?

01:02:13.231 --> 01:02:15.774
You must be getting
pretty popular these days.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:16.775
Go away.

01:02:18.861 --> 01:02:20.279
I saw your dad at the club.

01:02:21.489 --> 01:02:23.824
He said he hardly sees you anymore.

01:02:23.825 --> 01:02:24.951
Like he cares.

01:02:28.121 --> 01:02:29.455
I'd like to see you again.

01:02:30.665 --> 01:02:31.498
For your sake.

01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:33.543
Oh, lucky me.

01:02:36.212 --> 01:02:38.505
What have I done to
deserve this treatment?

01:02:38.506 --> 01:02:40.007
What haven't you done, Chip?

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.300
Wait a minute.

01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:45.804
Is this the same girl
who pledged eternal love

01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:47.264
in the back seat of my car?

01:02:47.265 --> 01:02:50.225
If you ever tell anybody
about that, I will kill you!

01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:51.226
Don't worry.

01:02:52.145 --> 01:02:54.396
It's our little secret.

01:02:54.397 --> 01:02:55.606
Go away.

01:02:57.066 --> 01:03:00.944
Hey, I'm tryin' to
give you another chance.

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:02.195
Great.

01:03:02.196 --> 01:03:03.321
You stood me up.

01:03:03.322 --> 01:03:04.614
You cheated on me.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:06.576
You ruined my best sweater.

01:03:07.535 --> 01:03:11.664
And I would rather die before
I'd go out with you again.

01:03:15.334 --> 01:03:16.753
What are you tryin' to say?

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:20.756
Go away, Chip.

01:03:20.757 --> 01:03:21.799
I have a date.

01:03:24.552 --> 01:03:25.595
You mean Kong?

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:29.640
Is he housebroken?

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.186
This movie's so bogus.

01:03:34.979 --> 01:03:36.062
It really is.

01:03:36.063 --> 01:03:37.522
Watch this.

01:03:37.523 --> 01:03:40.108
The guy's gonna go down into the basement

01:03:40.109 --> 01:03:41.360
without a flashlight.

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:43.570
Brilliant.

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:48.409
Never mind the fact that everyone
else in the movie's dead.

01:03:50.453 --> 01:03:51.662
How stupid.

01:03:53.372 --> 01:03:54.707
Next thing you know...

01:03:57.502 --> 01:04:00.003
Naughty.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.014
Meter's running, Chip.

01:04:11.015 --> 01:04:13.142
Or are you using a credit card?

01:04:15.061 --> 01:04:16.062
Oh, Roxanne?

01:04:17.396 --> 01:04:19.689
She's okay.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:23.026
She keeps me in shape till you come back.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.612
Right, possible.

01:04:26.364 --> 01:04:28.199
Well, she does get impatient though.

01:04:29.826 --> 01:04:31.535
Can't say I blame her.

01:04:31.536 --> 01:04:32.537
Give me a break.

01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:36.624
But I'll be home all summer.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:39.709
Call me sometime.

01:04:41.254 --> 01:04:42.296
I'll be busy.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:45.173
I'll be waiting.

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.527
Oh, you're back.

01:05:05.528 --> 01:05:06.903
Let's get outta here.

01:05:06.904 --> 01:05:08.280
No.

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:10.574
I'm beginning to like this picture.

01:05:18.082 --> 01:05:20.333
So tomorrow after you go
shopping, would it be all right

01:05:20.334 --> 01:05:22.043
if I came and picked you up on my bike?

01:05:22.044 --> 01:05:23.211
Sure.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:24.129
Good.

01:05:24.130 --> 01:05:26.798
There's a certain spot
I'd like to show ya.

01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:28.008
Where?

01:05:30.261 --> 01:05:31.761
Well, it's kind of romantic.

01:05:31.762 --> 01:05:33.763
It's, uh, up in the canyon.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:34.764
You may like it.

01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:39.060
Okay.

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:42.355
So!

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:47.236
This is what you ended up with?

01:05:48.529 --> 01:05:50.114
If I'd known you'd sink this low,

01:05:51.866 --> 01:05:53.617
I never would've dumped ya.

01:05:53.618 --> 01:05:55.327
Chip, you're a jerk.

01:05:55.328 --> 01:05:57.037
Why don't you just leave us alone?

01:05:57.038 --> 01:05:57.996
Come on.

01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.373
Don't you miss me?

01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:03.793
All those good times we had together.

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:04.794
Chip.

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:05.629
Homecoming.

01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:06.630
Chip!

01:06:07.924 --> 01:06:09.300
The hayride.

01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:13.428
That's enough.

01:06:13.429 --> 01:06:15.347
Oh, it speaks.

01:06:15.348 --> 01:06:17.599
I said, that's enough.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:21.811
Listen, bud, that's what
she said when I fucked

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:25.231
her brains out in the
back seat of old red here.

01:06:25.232 --> 01:06:26.943
Shut up!

01:06:29.403 --> 01:06:31.863
Falling for me again, huh?

01:06:31.864 --> 01:06:32.864
And you...

01:07:06.816 --> 01:07:07.816
No!

01:07:16.492 --> 01:07:17.701
What are you doing?

01:07:17.702 --> 01:07:19.035
Are you out of your mind?

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:20.036
Very naughty.

01:07:21.330 --> 01:07:22.372
You killed him!

01:07:22.373 --> 01:07:23.873
Punishment is good.

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:25.166
I hate you, Ricky.

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:26.334
Punishment is absolute.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:27.919
I hate you!

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920
Punish!

01:07:30.172 --> 01:07:31.172
Uh-oh!

01:07:47.815 --> 01:07:49.066
Freeze, asshole!

01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:52.110
Okay, pal.

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.238
You stand right there.

01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:01.703
Right there!

01:08:06.292 --> 01:08:08.210
Let's be real civilized about this.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:11.504
Okay.

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.926
That's fine.

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.183
Now, I don't wanna have to hurt you.

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:26.644
All I'm gonna do is slip these cuffs on.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:28.229
And no funny stuff!

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:33.234
I know how to use this.

01:09:02.264 --> 01:09:04.682
Hey, what the hell's
all that noise out there?

01:09:08.813 --> 01:09:10.022
Motherfucker.

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:32.377
Garbage day!

01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:34.337
Huh, no!

01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:08.872
Excuse me, mister.

01:10:08.873 --> 01:10:09.999
That's okay.

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:33.855
Bingo!

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:38.127
Drop your weapon!

01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:39.128
Drop it!

01:11:43.759 --> 01:11:45.302
I repeat, drop it!

01:11:46.387 --> 01:11:47.387
Now!

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:57.480
No!

01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:58.648
Don't do it!

01:11:58.649 --> 01:11:59.482
No!
It's not worth it!

01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:01.484
- Don't be a fool!
- Don't do it!

01:12:01.485 --> 01:12:02.528
Don't kill yourself!

01:12:16.667 --> 01:12:17.667
No more bullets.

01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:22.798
Young and stupid.

01:12:25.759 --> 01:12:27.052
That was my problem.

01:12:30.973 --> 01:12:33.474
And it's a shame they stopped me

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:35.894
before I did what I really had to do.

01:12:42.318 --> 01:12:44.069
But, hey, that's life.

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:03.422
Sorry things worked out this way, Henry.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:06.550
You only wanted to help.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:10.137
I appreciate the effort though.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:14.850
But between you and me,
Doc, I know who's to blame.

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:21.565
- Hey, what the!
- Oh, my God, he's loose!

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:39.874
We've got a problem, Sister.

01:13:39.875 --> 01:13:41.668
He walked outta here six hours ago.

01:13:43.212 --> 01:13:44.338
And it's Christmas eve.

01:13:45.672 --> 01:13:47.508
The orphanage is closed, Lieutenant.

01:13:48.717 --> 01:13:50.968
Mother Superior had a stroke.

01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:52.930
She's retired and lives alone.

01:13:54.515 --> 01:13:55.515
Oh, my God.

01:13:59.186 --> 01:14:00.603
Nah.

01:14:00.604 --> 01:14:01.980
He'd have to find her first.

01:14:03.690 --> 01:14:06.652
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:08.736
Ho, ho, ho!

01:14:08.737 --> 01:14:10.781
Give a dollar for the kiddies!

01:14:11.907 --> 01:14:12.907
Ho, ho, ho.

01:14:13.742 --> 01:14:15.993
Well, hello there, big fella.

01:14:15.994 --> 01:14:19.206
How'd you like to give a
little somethin' to Santa?

01:14:49.319 --> 01:14:51.612
Oh, ho!

01:15:12.634 --> 01:15:13.468
Hello?

01:15:13.469 --> 01:15:15.803
Merry Christmas.

01:15:15.804 --> 01:15:17.555
Who is this?

01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:19.433
Santa's back!

01:16:08.899 --> 01:16:10.775
Merry Christmas!

01:16:10.776 --> 01:16:14.529
Live from downtown, it's
the annual Christmas parade,

01:16:14.530 --> 01:16:16.280
featuring a selection of the city's

01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:18.908
number one drill teams, marching bands

01:16:18.909 --> 01:16:20.201
and cheerful floats.
Shameful.

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:21.954
- From all over the area.
- Sacrilegious.

01:16:22.996 --> 01:16:26.290
Why, they've made a
travesty of the sacraments.

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.151
Children should be in bed.

01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:50.667
Mother Superior!

01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:58.342
I've got a present for you!

01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:11.563
Oh, there you are!

01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:18.361
That was close.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:27.119
Come on!

01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:30.039
Let me in.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:34.586
I wanna talk about old times.

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:00.069
Oh, good.

01:19:00.070 --> 01:19:02.113
I love a chase!

01:19:02.114 --> 01:19:05.533
And, hey, kids,
here comes Santa Claus!

01:19:05.534 --> 01:19:09.203
He's gonna find out who's
been naughty or nice.

01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:13.040
Ohh!

01:19:57.669 --> 01:20:00.713
Gotcha!

01:20:07.387 --> 01:20:08.889
I'm really mad now!

01:21:07.489 --> 01:21:08.489
Richard?

01:21:11.368 --> 01:21:12.368
Richard!

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:15.705
You come and face me!

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:18.707
Oh.

01:21:18.708 --> 01:21:21.211
Richard, I am not afraid of you.

01:21:23.088 --> 01:21:26.132
You are weak, just like your brother.

01:21:28.802 --> 01:21:33.181
And like your brother,
you must be punished.

01:21:42.315 --> 01:21:44.109
You're looking well.

01:21:46.486 --> 01:21:49.322
I am your Mother Superior!

01:21:50.448 --> 01:21:54.034
As I raised you from a child,

01:21:54.035 --> 01:21:58.247
I order you to put that weapon down

01:21:58.248 --> 01:22:01.292
and take your punishment!

01:22:01.293 --> 01:22:02.711
No more punishment.

01:22:04.296 --> 01:22:06.006
You are being very, very naughty!

01:22:09.759 --> 01:22:10.969
Naughty this!

01:22:24.274 --> 01:22:26.818
You two, up the stairs!

01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:31.948
This way, Lieutenant.

01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:59.476
Mother Superior?

01:23:02.312 --> 01:23:04.272
Mother Superior, it's Sister Mary.

01:23:05.607 --> 01:23:06.900
Please, dear God.

01:23:10.403 --> 01:23:14.531
Mother Superior, are you all right?

01:23:17.827 --> 01:23:18.827
Boo!

01:24:05.250 --> 01:24:06.834
He's gone, Sister.

01:24:06.835 --> 01:24:07.835
It's over.
