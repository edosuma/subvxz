WEBVTT

00:18.953 --> 00:21.286
NICK: Your hair
looks so different.
Well, get used to it, boys.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.855
'Cause we're single,
we're sophisticated.

00:22.857 --> 00:25.324
And we just went to a
place to get blow-outs.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.458
What's a blow-out?

00:26.460 --> 00:27.826
You know how it's impossible

00:27.828 --> 00:29.294
to make your own hair
look amazing?

00:29.296 --> 00:31.330
Uh, I do not.
Yeah, you know
whose hair I admire?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.232
Jesus. Man, dude's
hair get overlooked

00:33.234 --> 00:35.401
because of all the
miracles and stuff.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.070
So, there's a place
that just blows out your hair?

00:38.072 --> 00:39.471
Well, they wash it first.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.006
So, essentially they
create a problem,

00:41.008 --> 00:43.075
and then charge you to fix it.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.210
Here's a, a business
idea I just thought of.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.712
Why don't I break the
heels off your shoe,

00:46.714 --> 00:48.747
and then charge you
to glue them back on?

00:48.749 --> 00:51.150
Or, uh, take your sore
back and adjust it.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.886
Which would, uh, just
make me a chiropractor.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.320
You ladies need
to be very careful.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.689
Blow-out can give a woman
too much confidence.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.158
Make them take on things
that they can't handle.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.159
Hillary Clinton.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.226
Oh, hey, Ken. You can just

01:01.228 --> 01:02.528
put the beer behind the bar.

01:02.530 --> 01:03.762
Oh, actually I was
coming over here

01:03.764 --> 01:05.531
to talk to the pretty ladies.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.066
(both laugh)

01:07.068 --> 01:08.367
Nice hair.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.435
(both laugh)

01:09.437 --> 01:10.769
(laughs)
Hey, Jess.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.071
Hey, Cece.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.073
Bear Claw, hello.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.175
I'd offer you my hand,
but it's quite wet.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.576
Still standing close to people.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.877
My building has
cable Internet now.

01:18.879 --> 01:20.345
Did you get even prettier?

01:20.347 --> 01:21.413
(laughs):
What?

01:21.415 --> 01:22.448
No.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.749
What? No.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.617
What... no.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.087
You and Cece should come to
a party at our place tonight.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.421
I live with Ken.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.622
Ken played football in college.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.024
Do a football thing, Ken!

01:32.026 --> 01:33.125
I'm kidding, Ken.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.394
Nobody wants to see
that garbage.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.563
Anyway, gonna be some
cool people there.

01:37.565 --> 01:38.931
We know twin architects.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.299
Yeah, they're... brothers.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.433
Ken, what did we talk about?!

01:41.435 --> 01:42.468
Huh?

01:42.470 --> 01:43.569
Some people understand things

01:43.571 --> 01:44.603
that don't come

01:44.605 --> 01:46.305
quite naturally to your brain!

01:46.307 --> 01:47.940
Stupid dum-dum.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.641
Stay out of this.
You guys want to come?

01:49.643 --> 01:52.144
Um, could you excuse
us for a second?
- Yeah.

01:52.146 --> 01:55.147
You played that all wrong,
you stupid idiot.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.316
Cece, I know these
guys are weird, but

01:57.318 --> 02:00.385
parties have cute guys
who aren't Schmidt.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.554
What did Charisma say while
he was washing our hair?

02:02.556 --> 02:03.889
He said he was worried
about Taylor Swift

02:03.891 --> 02:05.724
living in New York all alone.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.459
Well, yeah, we all are,
but he also said

02:07.461 --> 02:09.328
that we need to
embrace our freedom.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.263
We're single. We can
do whatever we want!

02:11.265 --> 02:13.832
The only thing
stopping us is us.

02:13.834 --> 02:17.436
And Charisma made us promise
not to waste these blow-outs.

02:17.438 --> 02:20.105
Our hair does look
so good right now.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.673
Let's do this!
Let's go to this party!

02:21.675 --> 02:24.576
Let's see where this
journey takes us!

02:24.578 --> 02:26.678
(birds chirping)

02:27.681 --> 02:29.915
Good morning.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.751
Hi.

02:32.753 --> 02:35.154
Do you want to hear
a funny story?

02:35.156 --> 02:36.989
This green pillow over here,

02:36.991 --> 02:40.492
I always use it
in between my legs

02:40.494 --> 02:43.529
like a... like a
second person.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.797
But it found its proper home

02:45.799 --> 02:47.866
underneath your head today.

03:03.150 --> 03:05.617
(both laugh)
MAN: Hey, hey...<i> mamma mia!</i>

03:05.619 --> 03:07.819
He slipped in the sauce.
Bookmark this one.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.454
Coach, get in here!
We're watching videos

03:09.456 --> 03:11.490
of Italians falling down.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.358
Oh, he's on a jog with May.
You know, I think

03:13.360 --> 03:14.893
he might've met his match
with that one.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.528
Rumor has it they haven't
even kissed yet.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.163
What was all that
noise in their room

03:18.165 --> 03:19.665
if they haven't kissed yet?
That's weird.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.667
Stop listening
by everybody's rooms

03:21.669 --> 03:23.835
for sex sounds, Winston.
- (laughs)

03:23.837 --> 03:25.504
Listen, if I'm not getting it,
Hey! Hey!

03:25.506 --> 03:27.139
I want to make sure everybody
else is getting it.

03:27.141 --> 03:28.707
Winston, I mean it, man.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.809
Good morning!

03:30.811 --> 03:32.544
I, uh, I believe
you all know May.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.046
Hi.
- If you'd like
to exchange pleasantries,

03:34.048 --> 03:36.315
please do so now,
as she is on her way out.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.683
NICK:
Why are you talking like

03:37.685 --> 03:39.985
you're high
and I'm your dad?

03:39.987 --> 03:42.054
Sorry I can't stay. I'm
performing at a benefit today.

03:42.056 --> 03:42.988
Oh.
- I'm playing

03:42.990 --> 03:44.656
Bach's "Cello Suite No. 1,"

03:44.658 --> 03:46.491
and all I have left to learn is

03:46.493 --> 03:48.493
the cadenza movement,
so it's...

03:48.495 --> 03:50.362
Well, at least it's
not the sarabande.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.730
Oh! Oh, my God!
(laughing)

03:51.732 --> 03:54.099
Right? I get this.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.068
That's crazy.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.769
Hey, you guys should come.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.405
Yeah, it's at an art gallery.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.241
Yeah, yeah. I-I think
I speak for everyone

04:02.243 --> 04:04.176
when I say<i> absolutmont.</i>

04:04.178 --> 04:06.712
(laughter)

04:06.714 --> 04:10.449
Something about Italians
on their asses, man.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.255
BOTH (gasp):
Oh, my God!

04:16.257 --> 04:19.458
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

04:19.460 --> 04:20.926
You have stickers

04:20.928 --> 04:23.028
on your neck.
- (groans)

04:23.030 --> 04:24.296
Ow!

04:24.298 --> 04:26.131
"The man, the legend"?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.566
Wouldn't that mean he
has no penis at all?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.600
Look, I had no choice, okay?

04:28.602 --> 04:29.701
He's sleeping on my shirt.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.703
We need to go! Walk of shame!

04:31.705 --> 04:33.272
Let's make a move.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.574
Wait a minute. Why do
women have to have a label

04:35.576 --> 04:37.776
for going home in the morning

04:37.778 --> 04:40.045
when for men it's
just... going home?

04:40.047 --> 04:42.447
Why don't we just call
ourselves what we are?

04:42.449 --> 04:45.450
Two respectable women
rushing to their car.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.551
Great.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.253
Aah!
- Aah!

04:48.255 --> 04:49.554
Oh!

04:49.556 --> 04:52.257
The sun! Hellfire!

04:52.259 --> 04:55.127
Where's the car?
Where's my car?

04:55.129 --> 04:57.963
No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!
No! No! No, no, no, no!

04:57.965 --> 04:59.331
No, no, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

04:59.333 --> 05:00.432
What are we gonna do?

05:00.434 --> 05:02.134
My phone's dead.

05:02.136 --> 05:03.969
My phone is dead, too.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.637
I have no cash.
Now, what are we gonna do?

05:05.639 --> 05:06.672
Are we gonna walk?

05:06.674 --> 05:08.507
My feet are wrecked, okay?

05:08.509 --> 05:09.841
And carrying shoes?

05:09.843 --> 05:12.311
That's legit walk of shame.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.645
Please stop saying
"walk of shame."

05:13.647 --> 05:14.780
Also "legit."

05:14.782 --> 05:17.082
Not crazy about
that word, either.

05:17.084 --> 05:20.686
If that South African runner
who killed his girlfriend

05:20.688 --> 05:24.323
can run with no legs,
we can walk in heels.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.991
CECE:
Excuse you!

05:25.993 --> 05:28.327
Those little bitches
throwing us shade? Hey!

05:28.329 --> 05:30.295
Keep it moving!
(both laugh)

05:30.297 --> 05:32.597
This is a middle
school vice principal

05:32.599 --> 05:34.700
and can give both
of you detention.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.934
JESS: Hey, would
one of you let us

05:35.936 --> 05:38.437
use your phone
in exchange for...

05:38.439 --> 05:39.604
Cece?
- What?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.306
Cheese and a condom?

05:41.308 --> 05:42.841
It's for emergencies.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.545
Do you think Nick and Winston
should come to May's thing?

05:46.547 --> 05:47.546
No.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.680
I mean, I'm so freaked out

05:48.682 --> 05:50.015
that they're gonna embarrass me.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.016
I'm barely holding my own

05:51.018 --> 05:52.184
with May's friends as it is.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.186
It's always neo-romanticism

05:54.188 --> 05:55.687
with that guy-- like Rihm,

05:55.689 --> 05:57.656
Rochberg, Zwilich.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.391
You know what song
I find neo-romantic?

05:59.393 --> 06:02.294
(humming Johnny Pearson's
"Heavy Action")

06:04.298 --> 06:06.965
It's<i> Monday Night Football?</i>

06:06.967 --> 06:08.400
Uh...

06:08.402 --> 06:11.069
Why is it, like,
weird right now?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.205
It's a good thing that
I'm coming with you.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.240
I know a ton about
classical music.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.409
I played the ghost of
Rachmaninoff in a loosely based

06:17.411 --> 06:19.411
high school production of<i> Shine.</i>

06:19.413 --> 06:21.713
Now, do you think I'm crazy
for, like, thinking like that?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.882
Like, what do you think
about Nick and Winston coming?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.751
You know, I brought Nick
to a work dinner once.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.386
(whoops)
That was fun!

06:27.388 --> 06:29.221
Now, that place was fancy.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.989
(groans)

06:30.991 --> 06:32.224
(grunts)

06:32.226 --> 06:33.425
Vest without a shirt?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.160
I mean, it's a clean look.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.162
It's just not for that occasion.
You-you don't think

06:37.164 --> 06:39.030
we should tell them
not to come, though, right?

06:39.032 --> 06:40.332
I think we can tell
them whatever we want.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.666
Oh, hey, hey. And then...

06:41.668 --> 06:43.668
so, that's, it's his side.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.770
Hey, Nick!

06:44.772 --> 06:47.572
(sputters)

06:47.574 --> 06:49.908
What's up, man?

07:00.788 --> 07:03.188
Nick, pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up!

07:03.190 --> 07:04.689
MALE VOICE:
The voice mailbox for...

07:04.691 --> 07:06.024
NICK:
Penis Wilson.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.793
MALE VOICE:
...is full. Good-bye.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.461
And there it is.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.230
All the numbers I know by heart.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.698
That's more than me.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.033
Learn from us.

07:15.035 --> 07:17.235
Also, never open
a line of credit

07:17.237 --> 07:20.439
for your boyfriend no matter
how talented of an artist he is.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.974
Uh, we are walking.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.810
We're walking.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.745
CECE:
All right.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.881
This is a legit walk of shame.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.416
Oh, yeah.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.151
Rough start, ladies!

07:33.153 --> 07:34.519
It was the blow-out.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.255
It was the blow-out.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.491
It's gonna be okay.
Come on, let's go.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.463
Oh, my God,
they look so comfy.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.231
Okay, you got it, okay?
You got it.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.767
Just give it a good...
(grunts)

07:48.769 --> 07:50.769
Oh, God, I need
those sneakers.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.437
Ooh!
So close, so close.

07:52.439 --> 07:54.940
You got it on this one,
you got it, you got it.

07:54.942 --> 07:55.941
Yeah.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.142
(screams)

07:57.144 --> 07:59.678
No! No!

08:02.583 --> 08:05.150
Let's follow that train.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.287
JESS:
Look at it, just sitting
there, so full and so watery.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.522
If we steal that water,

08:10.524 --> 08:11.790
are we criminals?

08:11.792 --> 08:13.124
If we cross this fence,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.626
are we crossing a line
that we can never...?

08:14.628 --> 08:16.228
Shut up, we
are going in.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.465
WINSTON:
Makes sense.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.833
Ugh, I can't believe
we have to go

08:21.835 --> 08:23.301
to that stupid music thing.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.503
I just found these
two-for-one

08:24.505 --> 08:25.971
coupons to the
water park.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.806
Wow.
- They reopened
the wave pool

08:27.808 --> 08:29.975
because it's been two years to
the day since that guy died.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.810
R.I.P.,
Mike Beakman.
- SCHMIDT:
All right, you know what?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.478
I'll... I'll take one
for the team.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.046
You guys go to
the water park,

08:35.048 --> 08:36.448
and I'll go
with Coach.
- COACH:
Really?

08:36.450 --> 08:37.716
My eyes react poorly

08:37.718 --> 08:39.184
to children's urine anyway.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.686
Don't ask me how I know that.
Sweet.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.021
You guys are gonna have
so much fun without us.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.556
Yeah, come on, Coach.
- Man...

08:44.558 --> 08:46.525
Let's go put on our most
scrotum-crushing trousers.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.159
Thanks a lot, guys.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.394
(chuckles)

08:49.396 --> 08:50.862
Those lousy serpents.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.564
They don't want us to come.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.733
Damn lousy serpents.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.034
(hissing)

08:56.036 --> 08:57.302
They must think we're stupid.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.904
I don't want to go...
- Mm-hmm.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.338
...but I don't like
the idea of not going

09:00.340 --> 09:02.207
because they don't
want us to go,

09:02.209 --> 09:04.509
rather than not going
because<i> we</i> don't want to go.

09:04.511 --> 09:06.211
That's right, 'cause if
we don't go, then who gonna go

09:06.213 --> 09:07.712
when we don't want to,
'cause we go.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.814
Right? Rewind.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.317
Come on, I'm being
very clear here.
Where are we going and why?

09:12.319 --> 09:14.352
We're going everywhere
for both reasons.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.820
(hissing)

09:15.822 --> 09:17.722
How do you
do it so smooth?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.591
(hisses) Just...
(hisses) ...exhale.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.160
(stuttering hiss)

09:22.162 --> 09:22.894
(smooth hiss)

09:22.896 --> 09:24.429
(stuttering hiss)

09:24.431 --> 09:26.264
I just can't do it.
I don't even care about it.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.233
Just gonna...

09:28.235 --> 09:29.434
Oh, that's heavy.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.102
Yeah.
- Okay.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.737
Let's just knock it over.
Push it ov-- push it.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.372
Push, push...
- Go.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.574
Oh! Fall back,

09:35.576 --> 09:37.175
fall back, fall back, fall back.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.612
We're trapped.

09:40.614 --> 09:43.114
Now what? Wait until
the kid's party's over?

09:43.116 --> 09:46.451
Kids unwrap presents
so slowly.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.019
I know. Kids are so slow.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.621
I think this is rock bottom.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.022
Cece...

09:51.024 --> 09:54.526
I have to tell you
something embarrassing.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.427
What?

09:55.429 --> 09:57.028
I didn't sleep

09:57.030 --> 09:59.197
with Bear Claw last night.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.800
I did something even worse.

10:02.636 --> 10:03.969
We made up a musical

10:03.971 --> 10:05.103
about woodland creatures.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.205
¶ Owls and squirrels and deer ¶

10:07.207 --> 10:09.140
¶ Raccoon and caribou ¶
¶ And otters ¶

10:09.142 --> 10:11.776
¶ Get out of here,
you're not welcome ¶

10:11.778 --> 10:13.545
¶ Get out of here ¶
¶ Get out of here ¶

10:13.547 --> 10:15.113
¶ Caribou, caribou... ¶

10:15.115 --> 10:16.615
(laughing)
- It's true.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.916
(chuckles)

10:17.918 --> 10:19.551
Why did you make it seem like...

10:19.553 --> 10:21.219
Because I didn't have
a one-night stand

10:21.221 --> 10:22.587
like a normal woman.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.755
I stayed up all night

10:23.757 --> 10:25.657
pretending to be a singing tree.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.993
¶ I'm just a dumb old tree ¶

10:27.995 --> 10:30.228
¶ No, you're not, take it back ¶

10:30.230 --> 10:33.131
¶ Nobody ever pets me-e-e-e ¶

10:33.133 --> 10:34.633
¶ 'Cause you're just a tree ¶

10:34.635 --> 10:36.501
¶ They just eat my nuts ¶

10:36.503 --> 10:42.741
¶ Eat my nuts, eat my nuts. ¶

10:45.646 --> 10:48.813
You're right.
That is way more shameful.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.248
(giggles weakly)
All right.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.083
Confession.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.219
I did not sleep
with Ken, either.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.254
Yeah, we started hooking up

10:56.256 --> 10:57.522
and then I called him...
Schmidt.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.590
That's okay. It happens.

10:58.592 --> 10:59.758
Twice.
- Whatever.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.760
Four times.
Okay, that's bad.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.261
I know, I felt so bad
afterwards,

11:03.263 --> 11:04.729
I straightened up his room.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.265
I am a grown woman

11:07.267 --> 11:09.367
that is in love
with her ex-boyfriend

11:09.369 --> 11:12.203
that has a girlfriend.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.939
And I've been stealing
my neighbor's Wi-Fi.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.675
I mean, what have I become?

11:16.677 --> 11:20.845
This day is about
to turn around.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.219
Wait.

11:33.293 --> 11:34.526
Coach.

11:34.528 --> 11:35.827
What?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.128
Just-just put it
in your pocket.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.363
No, dude.
It had pork belly on it.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.331
Just put it in your pocket.
Do it.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.300
I used to play the violin.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.235
Then I became a real musician.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.237
(laughs)

11:46.239 --> 11:47.572
Because your instrument's
bigger, right?

11:47.574 --> 11:48.406
(chuckles)

11:48.408 --> 11:50.141
Cello knowledge.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.309
Yeah.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.144
(whispering):
The cello is bigger.

11:53.146 --> 11:55.213
Nice.
(Nick and Winston laughing)

11:56.683 --> 11:59.017
The hell are
they doing here?
- I don't know.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.885
They're drinking
at a normal pace.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.188
There's nothing
stuck to them.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.689
Exactly.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.157
The hell are they up to?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.328
You are a genius.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.030
Sweet, sweet city water.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.699
Okay. You know how
today's been

12:14.701 --> 12:16.101
kind of like
a-a crappy day?

12:16.103 --> 12:16.868
Mm-hmm.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.336
Well, how would you feel

12:18.338 --> 12:20.939
if that hose belonged
to your ex-boyfriend?

12:22.209 --> 12:23.475
Jess?

12:26.446 --> 12:29.114
Genzlinger!

12:29.116 --> 12:31.449
Hey! Uh...

12:31.451 --> 12:32.951
Blast from the past!

12:32.953 --> 12:34.319
How's that ass?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.755
That ass is good.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.956
I don't know if that's
an expression, but...

12:37.958 --> 12:39.724
How the heck are you?

12:39.726 --> 12:42.060
Good. How...
Oop.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.763
(chuckles)
Don't know why I did that.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.030
Did it again.
I don't know why.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.936
Why you guys dressed
up all nice? Huh?

12:51.938 --> 12:54.139
Talking all polite and stuff.
What-What's going on?

12:54.141 --> 12:56.608
Oh, we're just here
for the culture

12:56.610 --> 12:58.643
and, uh, the spectacle
of it all.
- Really?

12:58.645 --> 13:00.912
And to make you look like
a stupid piece of crap

13:00.914 --> 13:03.481
for thinking we'd be
an embarrassment to you.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.582
I'm patting you down.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.984
Hey.
- I'm an American citizen.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.452
I request a female
if you're gonna do that.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.053
Stop it.
Stop.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.288
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- Ah, ah.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.656
Get your paws
off of me.
- I feel something!

13:11.658 --> 13:13.057
I feel something!
Show some class, Coach.

13:13.059 --> 13:13.992
NICK:
Get your paws

13:13.994 --> 13:16.094
off of me!
- Ow!

13:16.096 --> 13:18.329
Toothpick in my leg!
(flute plays discordant notes)

13:18.331 --> 13:20.431
Oh, dip.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.033
Ernie!

13:23.670 --> 13:25.570
Please apologize to Frondi.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.406
The flautist.

13:28.408 --> 13:29.741
Uh...

13:29.743 --> 13:30.842
The flute player.

13:30.844 --> 13:32.076
Oh.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.979
Sorry, Frondi.

13:35.982 --> 13:38.583
I should go.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.655
We'll take care of the
charges and the damages.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.523
We'll spare
no expense.
- No, we will not.
No, we will not.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.525
We will spare
no expense.
- No, we will not.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.761
So, yeah, I got promoted
to vice principal.

13:49.763 --> 13:51.029
VP.
- Great.

13:51.031 --> 13:52.664
I have a bottle
of soy sauce on my desk,

13:52.666 --> 13:54.265
so no more packets for me.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.201
Hey, you got a little
roly poly bug on you, hmm?

13:56.203 --> 13:57.969
Oh...

13:57.971 --> 14:00.338
I get it.
- What?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.840
I wasn't born
yesterday!

14:01.842 --> 14:03.641
You think we're on
a walk of shame.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.043
I didn't, but...

14:05.045 --> 14:06.778
Congratulations.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.314
You spend your Sundays
having cupcake parties

14:09.316 --> 14:10.882
at your beautiful house
with your cute little

14:10.884 --> 14:13.284
half-Asian kid
and your daddy diaper bag...

14:13.286 --> 14:15.520
I think someone might need
a visit from the "rest police."

14:15.522 --> 14:16.721
Just because I don't
have a husband

14:16.723 --> 14:18.223
or a baby or a house

14:18.225 --> 14:19.891
doesn't mean
I'm not living right.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.392
We're still growing
and changing.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.194
Yeah.
- And that's
a good thing.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.829
Look at this hair.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.564
This is
single-girl hair.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.233
This is
adventure hair.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.870
This isn't boring,
married, settled hair.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.872
This is...
this is fun.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.006
We're fun.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.808
You know what I did
last night?

14:36.810 --> 14:39.010
I got totally obliterated,

14:39.012 --> 14:42.647
and I made up a musical fable
with a guy named Bear Claw,

14:42.649 --> 14:44.582
and it was better than sex.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.018
¶ I'm a little fox,
but I'm not that sly ¶

14:47.020 --> 14:48.419
¶ What can I say? ¶

14:48.421 --> 14:50.054
¶ I'm an honest
little guy. ¶

14:51.191 --> 14:53.491
Well, I'm glad
things are good...

14:53.493 --> 14:54.659
You know what,
Genzlinger?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.327
I don't care
what you think of me.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.495
'Cause this is
my journey.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.497
Welcome
to my freaking journey.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.199
Great, I wish
you luck...

15:01.201 --> 15:02.233
You ready?

15:02.235 --> 15:04.402
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.605
That's not Jenn.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.041
(sighs)

15:10.043 --> 15:11.843
Nope.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.544
This is not my
house, okay?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.380
This is not a
daddy diaper bag.

15:15.382 --> 15:18.016
This is a bag
of sadness.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.952
Because I am
a party clown.
(squeaks)

15:20.954 --> 15:22.954
I'm actually a musical
party clown, okay?

15:22.956 --> 15:28.026
So no one's had a more shameful
walk this morning than me.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.094
(squeaks)

15:32.299 --> 15:33.598
What happened
to Jenn?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.699
Thanks for
bringing that up.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.700
Salt in the wound.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.734
She left me.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.902
You know what I
did last night?

15:37.904 --> 15:39.037
I'm gonna tell you.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.939
I masturbated
to pornography

15:40.941 --> 15:44.409
that I had to draw on
the back of an envelope.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.710
(chuckles)
- Mmm.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.112
He's great with kids.
Who are you?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.081
I'm a Liza Minnelli
impersonator.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.950
¶ Ah... ¶

15:51.952 --> 15:53.151
So...

15:56.923 --> 15:58.790
Ah, guys, look,
I don't see much

15:58.792 --> 16:00.491
of the toothpick coming out.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.093
So, best move--

16:02.095 --> 16:04.429
push it all the way in,
and get it from the other side.

16:04.431 --> 16:05.630
Am I right? You guys agree?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.298
How could you guys
do this to me?

16:07.300 --> 16:08.599
NICK:
We didn't do anything.

16:08.601 --> 16:09.634
You embarrassed
yourself.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.069
Actually, you embarrassed us.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.770
And you do it
all the time, Coach.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.173
Like how you sit on
the hood of your car

16:15.175 --> 16:17.442
when you pump
gas into it.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.243
I mean, what, are you in
<i>Dukes of Hazzard,</i> you idiot?

16:19.245 --> 16:22.080
I saw Isaiah Thomas do it on
a poster once, and it was cool.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.514
And what are you
laughing at, all right?

16:23.516 --> 16:25.650
What?
- You put ChapStick on
like a little girl

16:25.652 --> 16:27.185
putting on lipstick
for the first time.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.921
(chuckling):
It's way too much puckering.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.990
Winston, you know what,
you shut up.
Cold busted.

16:31.992 --> 16:34.492
You're the most embarrassing one
of our friends by far.
With your singing.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.693
Your outfits.
- And the crystals.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.995
Your mural.
- The mustache.
- Your fauxhawk.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.596
With your bell.
- Puzzles.
- Your cat.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.632
FYI-- you guys live
with the cat, too.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.768
But at least I get
to reap the benefits.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.969
(chuckles)

16:44.971 --> 16:46.504
That.
- (door opens)

16:48.508 --> 16:50.308
Ah.
- (chuckling):
Oh, oh.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.310
Look, it's not what
it looks like, my man.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.479
Um, we're just trying to squeeze
something out of my buddy.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.947
We'll be done
when it comes out.

16:55.949 --> 16:57.081
(clicks tongue)

16:58.985 --> 17:00.518
COACH: Well, maybe it's
not gonna work with May.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.520
She's too good for me.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.522
I should just go back
to having soulless sex

17:04.524 --> 17:06.524
with beautiful women I share
no emotional connection...

17:06.526 --> 17:07.959
(shouts)
- Oh!

17:07.961 --> 17:09.060
All my hard work.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.361
May didn't start liking you

17:10.363 --> 17:12.363
because you play
some dumb instrument.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.732
She started liking you
because you're cocky.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.234
And you're funny.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.735
What, you're
afraid of her

17:17.737 --> 17:19.470
because she plays the
standing-up guitar?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.406
He's right, Coach, I don't know
why we're trying so hard

17:21.408 --> 17:22.740
to make you fit in here.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.741
You're Coach,

17:23.743 --> 17:25.643
sex in a sweat suit.
Yeah.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.212
If I've taught you one thing,
it's lead out with confidence.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.648
Follow up with comedy.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.651
And number trey, your home run,
your triple--

17:33.653 --> 17:35.219
have great looks.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.555
I got 'em,
and I passed them on to you.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.158
So get out there, you
beautiful peacock.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.427
Shake your tail feathers.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.862
I mean, I'd rather not get these
compliments with my pants down,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.597
but appreciate it.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.233
Paul, you don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.069
You don't have to clown
for these people.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.170
Yes, you do.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.271
She said...

17:53.273 --> 17:55.106
Open yourself up
to the journey.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.442
Look, if Taylor Swift can
live alone in New York,

17:57.444 --> 17:58.843
just think
what you can do.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.513
The only thing
stopping you is you.

18:04.117 --> 18:06.451
Yeah.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.286
Ma'am, I will not
clown for you today.

18:08.288 --> 18:09.921
Or any day thereafter.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.857
What are you doing?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.460
I am going on a journey.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.462
This is my freaking journey.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.530
(squeaking)

18:19.532 --> 18:21.566
We're taking back
the morning.
- (whoops)

18:21.568 --> 18:23.634
JESS: Happy birthday
to your little one.

18:31.244 --> 18:34.245
May, we run in
different circles.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.114
My circle's not even
really a circle.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.250
It's more of a swirling
mass of idiots.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.219
But, uh, that's me.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.720
Yeah, you didn't have
to come back in here

18:42.722 --> 18:43.788
to tell me
you were an idiot.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.156
No.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.892
What I need to tell
you is I like you.

18:47.894 --> 18:50.728
And that, um...

18:50.730 --> 18:52.730
and that I hate
classical music.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.398
I'm sorry, I
do-- I hate it.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.267
I mean, there's so many better
kinds of music now, it's...

18:56.269 --> 18:57.902
Okay.
- You know?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.738
But if you're playing
it, I want to listen.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.840
'Cause you mean a lot to me.
All right.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.814
I'm gonna play you a song,
and if you can name it...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.782
(sighs)
then we can give this
another shot.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.252
If you don't want to do this,
just... it's... I'm fine.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.155
(plays Johnny Pearson's
"Heavy Action")

19:30.103 --> 19:31.335
That's<i> Monday Night Football!</i>

19:31.337 --> 19:33.571
Yeah, I learned it for you.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.809
All right. Oh.

19:38.811 --> 19:39.810
Oh, sorry.

19:39.812 --> 19:40.878
That poked me.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.147
Okay.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.549
No, just don't touch it,
don't touch it.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.550
Okay, okay, okay.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.385
But okay.
- Okay.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.530
Los Angeles!
(shoes squeaking)

19:59.532 --> 20:01.499
We are sluts and we are clowns!

20:01.501 --> 20:03.401
But we are not losers!

20:03.403 --> 20:04.802
We are not losers!
- Yes!

20:04.804 --> 20:06.237
No, we're adventurers!

20:06.239 --> 20:08.406
Shame, shame,
I know your name.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.474
Ah... yo, Nicholas!

20:10.476 --> 20:11.842
Hey, Genzlinger!

20:11.844 --> 20:12.877
I miss you, man!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.178
Great shoes!

20:14.180 --> 20:15.746
Guess what, guys,
I'm still here.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.181
Take that,
Lyme's disease!

20:17.183 --> 20:18.649
Cecilia, what is that shirt?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.817
"The man, the legend"?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.552
Oh, I think
you've met the legend.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.221
Hey, you guys want a ride?!

20:23.223 --> 20:24.255
Yeah!
- Nah!

20:24.257 --> 20:25.690
No.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.525
No, we've made it this far.

20:27.527 --> 20:29.227
We're just gonna
carry on through.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.861
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.
- Yeah.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.196
Take that,
City of Angels!

20:32.198 --> 20:34.198
For the true
angels are we!

20:34.200 --> 20:35.533
Yes!

20:35.535 --> 20:37.401
Charisma, we didn't
waste your blow-out!

20:37.403 --> 20:39.103
I know we are having
a moment here.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.905
Just take it down
a notch, Jess.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.073
(elevator dings)

20:42.075 --> 20:43.274
Oh, thank God
we made it.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.442
BEAR CLAW:
Uh, Jess.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.244
You forgot your purse.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.445
I didn't look inside.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.213
(whispering):
But I did feel around.

20:49.215 --> 20:51.148
Thanks, Bear Claw.

20:53.386 --> 20:57.788
¶ The forest is very lonely
for a thing like he ¶

20:57.790 --> 20:59.724
¶ I'm a gay wolf ¶

20:59.726 --> 21:01.559

21:01.561 --> 21:03.628

21:06.266 --> 21:08.799
Oh.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.438
Yeah.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.473
¶ Today ¶

21:15.475 --> 21:17.775
(howls)

21:17.777 --> 21:20.778
It's why I didn't want
to come out here.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.113
We should go
to a minor next

21:22.115 --> 21:23.114
to really feel
the sadness

21:23.116 --> 21:24.248
and isolation.
- No.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.650
Yeah, he just wants
to be accepted, May.

21:25.652 --> 21:27.084
Yeah, got it,
love that.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.620
JESS:
