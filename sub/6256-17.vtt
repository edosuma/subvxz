00:32.482 --> 00:35.151
Central, this is Tyler O'Brian.

00:35.185 --> 00:37.186
Do you need a response team?

00:37.221 --> 00:38.721
That's negatory.

00:38.755 --> 00:41.457
I found absolutely <i>nada.</i>

00:41.492 --> 00:43.960
Tyler, quit calling in saying
you haven't found anything!

00:43.994 --> 00:46.128
Or you saw a pretty rock
or a bug.

00:46.163 --> 00:48.231
I just wanted to be thorough.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.766
Oh, my God!

00:52.436 --> 00:53.703
Hey, over here!

00:53.737 --> 00:55.371
We found something!

00:55.405 --> 00:56.706
- Come on!
- By the stream!

00:56.740 --> 00:58.608
Look at that!

00:58.642 --> 01:02.144
Oh, my God!

01:12.356 --> 01:14.156
Based on the amount
of blood absorption

01:14.191 --> 01:18.060
in the nearby soil, I'd say
the victim was killed here.

01:18.095 --> 01:19.562
Yeah, so is this Molly Delson?

01:19.596 --> 01:21.097
Could very well be.
"Could very well be"

01:21.131 --> 01:23.332
isn't enough
to inform her parents.

01:23.367 --> 01:24.967
Did you take a tone with me?

01:25.002 --> 01:26.522
What-What's with the tone?
He's hungry.

01:26.537 --> 01:29.906
So, uh, she was last seen a couple
miles from here at a prep school.

01:29.940 --> 01:32.875
These braces on her teeth
could help with the I.D.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.310
Molly Delson wore braces.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.012
Both of the parents
are orthodontists.

01:36.046 --> 01:38.614
Hair color matches.
Well, Dr. Brennan

01:38.649 --> 01:42.018
should be able to give us
age based on the teeth.

01:42.052 --> 01:44.186
Okay, look. How long's
the body been out here?

01:44.221 --> 01:46.088
Well, this is <i>Hermetia illuc...</i>

01:46.123 --> 01:48.057
Stop, bug boy.
I don't need the Latin.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.358
Fresh from hatching.

01:49.393 --> 01:50.893
They just ate
for exactly four days.

01:50.928 --> 01:53.629
Four days. Why can't
you just say four days?

01:53.664 --> 01:54.931
You gonna tell the parents?
Not until we're 100% here.

01:54.965 --> 01:56.499
I want, uh, Bones to take

01:56.533 --> 01:57.767
a look at the teeth.

02:01.438 --> 02:02.805
Good.

02:02.839 --> 02:04.407
Breathe naturally.

02:04.441 --> 02:08.176
And as you breathe out,
squeeze your bottom

02:08.211 --> 02:10.713
and suck your
belly button in and up

02:10.747 --> 02:12.648
to touch
your beating heart.

02:12.683 --> 02:14.684
A belly button
can't touch a heart.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.652
That's an impossible
instruction.

02:16.687 --> 02:18.721
Sweetie, it's
for visualization purposes.

02:18.755 --> 02:20.056
Well, I can't
visualize it.

02:20.090 --> 02:22.291
I can't do it.
Before I had the baby,

02:22.326 --> 02:24.293
I could put both my ankles
behind my head.

02:24.328 --> 02:26.896
Are you sure you don't want
to go to the crime scene?

02:26.930 --> 02:29.332
No. I'm taking it easier
this pregnancy.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.133
Perhaps when I'm further along.

02:31.168 --> 02:33.102
You <i>are</i> further along.

02:33.136 --> 02:34.637
Further than what?

02:34.671 --> 02:35.838
Than whatever you think you are.

02:35.872 --> 02:37.907
Now pull your abdominals back

02:37.941 --> 02:39.742
to touch your backbone.

02:39.776 --> 02:41.877
Again, not possible.

02:42.879 --> 02:45.214
The lack of eruption

02:45.248 --> 02:47.350
of the third molars
suggests that the victim

02:47.384 --> 02:49.852
is between the ages
of 14 and 18.

02:49.886 --> 02:51.988
Huh. Pretty exact
with teeth and age,

02:52.022 --> 02:54.090
but when it comes
to your belly...

02:54.124 --> 02:56.158
I have more than three months
to go, Angela.

02:56.193 --> 02:57.287
I've been pregnant before--
I know this.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.995
Now round your back,

02:58.996 --> 03:01.130
put your feet on the floor,

03:01.164 --> 03:04.066
and proceed
to roll up slowly,

03:04.101 --> 03:08.104
letting your spine
lift tall bit... by bit.

03:09.006 --> 03:10.373
And that's it.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.475
Good class, everybody.

03:12.509 --> 03:14.477
Well done.

03:14.511 --> 03:15.978
Thank you.

03:17.381 --> 03:19.081
Hey.

03:20.183 --> 03:22.084
I-I said, hey.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.086
Oh. To me?

03:24.121 --> 03:26.055
It seems they've found
Molly Delson's remains.

03:26.089 --> 03:28.090
Cam said it was
definitely murder.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.793
I... I spent the last
20 minutes of class

03:30.827 --> 03:33.295
trying to find a good
opening line, and...

03:33.330 --> 03:34.430
well...

03:34.464 --> 03:35.965
You went with "hey."
Right.

03:35.999 --> 03:38.067
Which... was clearly
neither direct

03:38.101 --> 03:39.835
nor particularly witty.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.470
So I'm gonna just
skip over the rest

03:41.505 --> 03:42.872
of my poorly
planned small talk

03:42.906 --> 03:44.740
and get right to
the point here.

03:44.775 --> 03:46.642
Maybe I could
get your number?

03:47.711 --> 03:49.445
My number?

03:49.479 --> 03:51.414
You'll have to do a
facial reconstruction

03:51.448 --> 03:52.782
to confirm.

03:52.816 --> 03:56.118
Hey, that guy is
totally hitting on Daisy.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.653
Is that strange?

03:57.688 --> 04:00.690
I'm... I'm just not sure
that she's ready

04:00.724 --> 04:02.658
so soon after Sweets died.

04:02.693 --> 04:05.161
Well, it's been
nearly six months.

04:05.195 --> 04:08.631
I remember being quite excited
after my first pregnancy

04:08.665 --> 04:11.434
to return
to normal sexual activity.

04:11.468 --> 04:14.170
Uh, you...
you were <i>very</i> excited.

04:14.204 --> 04:16.839
Yeah. Because it was
with the man I loved,

04:16.873 --> 04:19.942
who got me pregnant,
who stayed alive.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.077
What difference does
any of that make?

04:25.015 --> 04:28.551
Yeah, maybe...
maybe not that much.

04:34.424 --> 04:36.492
I think we might want
to talk to the guy

04:36.526 --> 04:38.227
who fled after
finding the body.

04:38.261 --> 04:40.096
You mean the pot brownie guy?
Yeah.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.298
Name: Tyler O'Brian.
Age: 24.

04:42.332 --> 04:43.933
Guy's a convicted
sex offender.

04:43.967 --> 04:46.669
He did three years for
having sex with a minor--

04:46.703 --> 04:48.404
15-year-old girl.

04:48.438 --> 04:50.740
Wait a second, you think
that he, uh, positioned himself

04:50.774 --> 04:52.141
to find his own
murder victim?

04:52.175 --> 04:54.276
Fits the profile:
highly intelligent,

04:54.311 --> 04:56.885
narcissistic, like he
wanted us to see his work.

04:56.909 --> 04:58.147
So then he drops

04:58.148 --> 05:00.049
the pot brownie and runs?
That throws doubt

05:00.083 --> 05:01.517
in your
"highly intelligent" theory.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.186
"High" part works, though.
Look, you ever hear

05:04.221 --> 05:06.889
of a person, a really smart
person, you know, who, uh,

05:06.923 --> 05:08.891
denies something
that's obvious

05:08.925 --> 05:11.093
to everyone but not to them?

05:11.128 --> 05:13.562
You mean like
Dr. B and her belly?

05:13.597 --> 05:14.797
I didn't say that.
Okay, if I couldn't

05:14.831 --> 05:16.398
see through that attempt
at subtlety,

05:16.433 --> 05:18.200
I don't think
I'd be much of an investigator.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.769
Just bring in the pot brownie guy.
Oh.

05:19.803 --> 05:21.570
Bring him in,
we'll talk, all right?

05:21.605 --> 05:23.105
Yeah.
Thank you.

You guys watch
<i>Walking Dead?</i>

06:14.383 --> 06:17.251
How about the rape and the
murder of a 16-year-old girl,

06:17.286 --> 06:18.686
huh, is that illegal?

06:18.721 --> 06:21.122
Pretty sure that's
against the law, yeah.

06:21.156 --> 06:23.124
Good, I'm glad we cleared

06:23.158 --> 06:24.792
she seems like
she's your type, Tyler.

06:24.827 --> 06:26.594
Mm-hmm, underaged.
Hey,

06:26.628 --> 06:29.597
what I got convicted of
was statutory rape.

06:29.631 --> 06:32.834
From the word "statue,"
meaning "not real."

06:32.868 --> 06:35.103
That is not what it means.
I was 19,

06:35.137 --> 06:37.238
she was 15,
and she told the court

06:37.272 --> 06:38.539
it was consensual.

06:38.574 --> 06:41.743
I didn't kill her.
I swear to you guys.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.712
Gonna hold you
on possession charges.

06:46.515 --> 06:49.183
Well, at least that's
better than murder.

06:55.257 --> 06:57.458
Definitely a school uniform.

06:57.493 --> 06:59.394
Molly Delson attended
Pemberley Academy.

06:59.428 --> 07:01.763
They wear uniforms.
There are large numbers

07:01.797 --> 07:03.798
of remodeled microfractures
to the distal

07:03.832 --> 07:06.768
and proximal ends of the femurs.
Also on the tibia and ulna.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.803
Let's take a closer look,
Ms. Wick,

07:08.837 --> 07:12.907
to confirm my suspicions that
these fractures date from seven

07:12.941 --> 07:14.842
to ten years ago.
Beaten as a child?

07:14.877 --> 07:16.644
Is that a thing?

07:16.678 --> 07:19.380
A child being beaten until puberty
at which point the abuse just stops?

07:19.415 --> 07:23.317
You know who was good at
those kind of questions? Lance.

07:23.352 --> 07:25.820
I suspect
Dr. Sweets would say that

07:25.854 --> 07:30.391
the abuse continued until
the child was capable to explain

07:30.426 --> 07:32.160
her injuries
to an outsider.

07:32.194 --> 07:34.729
It's common sense,
not... psychology.

07:34.763 --> 07:37.031
Still, I miss him.

07:37.065 --> 07:39.100
We all miss Sweets.

07:39.134 --> 07:41.135
So I shouldn't go out on a date?

07:41.170 --> 07:42.370
Wow.

07:42.404 --> 07:44.672
Of course you should go
on a date, Ms. Wick.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.809
But it hasn't even been a year.
What is the importance

07:47.843 --> 07:51.293
of an arbitrary period of time?
It correlates to nothing.

07:51.294 --> 07:53.159
Okay, but at what point
in the relationship

07:53.160 --> 07:55.462
do I tell the man that
I have a baby at home?

07:55.496 --> 07:57.397
Now the date
is a "relationship"?

07:57.431 --> 07:58.798
Can we get back

07:58.833 --> 08:00.333
to this murdered girl, please?

08:00.368 --> 08:01.468
All right, so I found

08:01.502 --> 08:03.803
some fibers around
the victim, as well as

08:03.838 --> 08:06.072
some beads.
Fancy. From a necklace?

08:06.107 --> 08:07.907
Could be an indication
of a struggle.

08:07.942 --> 08:09.743
The killer
could have torn the necklace

08:09.777 --> 08:13.012
off of her.
I finished the facial reconstruction.

08:17.685 --> 08:20.820
This is definitely Molly Delson.

08:24.558 --> 08:26.659
<i>What happened?</i>

08:26.694 --> 08:29.129
How did Molly die?

08:29.163 --> 08:31.931
We don't have cause of
death yet, Mrs. Delson.

08:31.966 --> 08:34.067
Do you have any idea

08:34.101 --> 08:36.169
who did this to her?
No,

08:36.203 --> 08:38.138
but, uh, my partner and her team

08:38.172 --> 08:41.508
have come up with evidence
that suggests that Molly

08:41.542 --> 08:43.443
was physically abused
as a child.

08:43.477 --> 08:45.245
No. I-I don't...
I don't understand.

08:45.279 --> 08:46.713
We would have known.

08:46.747 --> 08:48.281
Yes, you would have.

08:48.315 --> 08:50.195
Wait, are you
accusing us of abusing

08:50.217 --> 08:51.518
our own child?

08:51.552 --> 08:52.652
That's absurd.

08:52.686 --> 08:53.987
You're gonna have

08:54.021 --> 08:55.789
a baby in a couple
months, right?

08:55.823 --> 08:58.383
How would you feel if someone
accused you of something like that?

08:58.392 --> 09:00.660
Well, I'm about...
six months away, actually,

09:00.694 --> 09:04.864
but I... it seems I might have
been wrong about the abuse.

09:05.699 --> 09:07.400
What?

09:07.435 --> 09:08.935
Is this Molly?

09:08.969 --> 09:10.537
Yes.
The type

09:10.571 --> 09:12.672
of fracture patterns I
identified on the X rays

09:12.706 --> 09:14.407
could very well
have resulted

09:14.442 --> 09:16.676
from her apparent
childhood obesity.

09:16.710 --> 09:18.778
Being overweight
broke her bones?

09:18.813 --> 09:21.214
Yes. A child carrying
that much weight

09:21.248 --> 09:24.384
could cause developing
growth plates to fracture

09:24.418 --> 09:26.986
and spiral out into
the long bones.

09:27.021 --> 09:28.555
I apologize

09:28.589 --> 09:31.057
for my erroneous
conclusion about abuse.

09:31.091 --> 09:33.893
Though you should have been
more attentive to her weight.

09:33.928 --> 09:35.195
Look who's talking.
Honey...

09:35.229 --> 09:36.362
If she's three
months pregnant,

09:36.397 --> 09:38.431
she's pretty damn
obese herself.

09:38.466 --> 09:40.866
Right, look, you must
have done something right, both of you,

09:40.868 --> 09:43.102
since... Molly did lose
all that weight.

09:43.137 --> 09:44.771
It was all

09:44.805 --> 09:46.206
her own willpower.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.274
Molly was an
overachiever.

09:48.309 --> 09:50.677
She... always had been.

09:50.711 --> 09:53.046
She couldn't stand
to disappoint anyone.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.647
Especially us.

09:54.682 --> 09:58.117
You know, she was number one
in her school class.

09:58.152 --> 10:00.720
Molly was...

10:02.122 --> 10:04.924
We couldn't have hoped
for a better child.

10:15.436 --> 10:17.103
Hey.

10:17.137 --> 10:19.772
Hey. Tox screen came back negative.
Well, the fiber I tested

10:19.807 --> 10:22.575
is from the generic carpeting
inside a car trunk, and...

10:22.610 --> 10:24.244
Duct tape.
Yeah.

10:24.278 --> 10:26.012
It sloughed off the body.
Also...

10:26.046 --> 10:27.847
Pardon me.

10:27.882 --> 10:29.282
Epithelial cells.

10:29.316 --> 10:30.783
Tinted.

10:30.818 --> 10:31.918
From a tattoo?

10:31.952 --> 10:32.986
Lip gloss.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.721
Someone duct-taped her mouth.

10:34.755 --> 10:37.190
She was kidnapped
before she was killed.

10:40.427 --> 10:43.863
Wow. A beautiful campus.

10:43.898 --> 10:45.932
Should be for the tuition
they charge.

10:45.966 --> 10:48.401
I agree, but 90%
of our girls make it

10:48.435 --> 10:50.637
into Ivy League schools,
so it's worth it.

10:50.671 --> 10:53.072
Do you two have a child
who'd like to attend Pemberley?

10:53.107 --> 10:55.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Oh, you-you think that we're...?

10:55.409 --> 10:56.809
No. What? Stop.

10:56.844 --> 10:58.177
FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth.

10:58.212 --> 10:59.646
This here is Agent Aubrey.
Yes.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.014
You're here about Molly.

11:01.048 --> 11:02.515
I'm the headmistress,
Amelia Minchin.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.317
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:04.351 --> 11:06.286
No, that's no problem, because,
hey, if we were a couple...

11:06.320 --> 11:07.720
Stop. Can we see
Molly's room, please?

11:07.755 --> 11:09.322
Of course.
Thank you.

11:09.356 --> 11:11.658
If we decided we wanted
to adopt a child...

11:11.692 --> 11:15.662
I understand what you're saying,
but we're not looking into it.

11:15.696 --> 11:17.397
This is Molly's dorm.

11:17.431 --> 11:19.666
Is it possible that Molly was
kidnapped from her dorm room?

11:19.700 --> 11:22.268
Unlikely, though it
is an all-girls school,

11:22.303 --> 11:25.038
so sneaking off campus
is not unheard of.

11:25.072 --> 11:27.040
Was she, um...?

11:27.074 --> 11:29.042
Rape kit came
back negative.

11:29.076 --> 11:30.410
Molly's parents said

11:30.444 --> 11:31.778
she was number
one in her class.

11:31.812 --> 11:34.213
In all of her classes--
everything but music.

11:34.248 --> 11:36.983
Being the best in music
demands more than willpower.

11:37.017 --> 11:39.052
It requires real talent.

11:39.086 --> 11:41.054
So, she was driven
to succeed. Okay.

11:41.088 --> 11:43.389
And-and socially,
did Molly fit in?

11:43.424 --> 11:45.391
Other than the normal
teenage problems,

11:45.426 --> 11:49.128
I wasn't aware of any
issues she had socially.

11:49.163 --> 11:51.664
The police sealed off Molly's
room after she disappeared

11:51.699 --> 11:53.433
so nothing would
be disturbed.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.902
Has anyone had access
to the room since the police?

11:55.936 --> 11:57.270
No, Agent Booth.

11:57.304 --> 11:58.904
I and the students
have been very careful

11:58.906 --> 12:01.140
to follow the instructions
the police gave us.

12:01.175 --> 12:03.776
Respect is paramount
here at Pemberley.

12:05.980 --> 12:08.214
Oh!

12:08.248 --> 12:10.516
I guess not
for everybody.

12:10.551 --> 12:12.518
You lose something?

12:16.688 --> 12:20.816
This would be Cayla
Seligman and Arianna Donas.

12:20.817 --> 12:23.419
I expect you have an
exceptionally compelling reason

12:23.453 --> 12:24.753
for being in this room?

12:24.788 --> 12:26.655
Ladies,

12:26.690 --> 12:28.357
I'm with the FBI,
so start talking.

12:28.391 --> 12:30.225
We were looking
for Molly's diary.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.628
- Why?
- Why do you think?

12:32.662 --> 12:34.063
Arianna.

12:34.097 --> 12:35.497
Diaries get turned
over to parents.

12:35.532 --> 12:36.966
We were trying to protect her

12:37.000 --> 12:38.334
if there was anything
embarrassing in it.

12:38.368 --> 12:39.969
Molly kept a diary?

12:40.003 --> 12:41.403
Handwritten? In a book?

12:41.438 --> 12:43.305
That's weirdly archaic.

12:43.340 --> 12:45.608
You can hide a book a lot easier
than you can hide a computer.

12:45.642 --> 12:47.322
Plus, no one can hack
a book off the cloud.

12:47.344 --> 12:49.178
- Right. So, did you find it?
- No.

12:49.212 --> 12:50.679
- I did.
- Oh.

12:50.714 --> 12:52.081
That's a new one.

12:52.115 --> 12:53.782
Not my first
boarding school case.

12:53.817 --> 12:55.317
Look at that, huh?

12:55.352 --> 12:57.119
So, you guys weren't friends
with Molly?

12:57.153 --> 12:58.487
We're all friends.

12:58.521 --> 12:59.855
You just wanted her diary

12:59.889 --> 13:01.190
because you care
so much about her?

13:01.224 --> 13:02.224
Yeah.

13:02.225 --> 13:04.293
Where were you four nights ago?

13:04.327 --> 13:05.894
Agent Booth, if you wish
to question the girls,

13:05.929 --> 13:07.563
you must proceed
through channels.

13:07.597 --> 13:09.098
Channels. Right.

13:09.132 --> 13:10.566
These girls weren't
friends with Molly.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.702
Check it out. Got the
college level textbooks,

13:13.737 --> 13:16.238
- the impersonality of the room.
- Nothing suggests

13:16.272 --> 13:18.073
a social life.
Ah, it's a good one, Aubrey.

13:18.108 --> 13:19.575
I told you, we're
a good couple.

13:19.609 --> 13:21.143
Right. Stop. Okay.

13:21.177 --> 13:23.445
So, if Molly was
taken from the room,

13:23.480 --> 13:24.947
she left without a fight.

13:24.981 --> 13:26.215
Taken?

13:26.249 --> 13:27.182
We have very good security.

13:27.217 --> 13:28.584
Oh, right, because,

13:28.618 --> 13:30.138
you know,
everybody respects the rules.

13:30.153 --> 13:31.754
So, ladies,
why don't you tell us what

13:31.788 --> 13:34.623
you were really looking for
in the diary? Hmm?

13:46.603 --> 13:48.570
Ms. Wick?

13:48.605 --> 13:50.973
Hmm?
Murder investigation?

13:51.007 --> 13:53.342
Oh! Yes. That's what I was
thinking about-- murder.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.943
Not dating again.

13:54.978 --> 13:58.447
And what has not thinking
about dating given us?

13:58.481 --> 14:03.052
Note the stab wound to
the right sternal third rib.

14:03.086 --> 14:06.488
Okay, a stab to that region
would probably not be fatal.

14:06.523 --> 14:08.691
There are at least 11
other similar wounds--

14:08.725 --> 14:10.759
ribs, femurs,
right ulna, pelvis.

14:10.794 --> 14:13.729
That would explain the amount
of blood at the crime scene.

14:13.763 --> 14:16.098
If you could Mikrosil...
I already did.

14:16.132 --> 14:18.467
'Cause I was not
thinking about dating.

14:19.937 --> 14:22.271
See the double blade
at the point?

14:22.306 --> 14:23.706
Yeah. Scissors?

14:23.740 --> 14:25.608
I found oodles
of particulates here.

14:25.642 --> 14:28.044
Look at. Glue, glitter, blue
and green construction paper.

14:28.078 --> 14:30.613
Blue and green
are Pemberley's colors.

14:30.647 --> 14:33.049
Man, everything leads
back to that school.

14:35.118 --> 14:37.687
Cayla Seligman and Arianna Donas

14:37.721 --> 14:39.655
are a college admissions
officer's dream.

14:39.690 --> 14:42.091
Okay, Cayla is the
captain of the field hockey,

14:42.125 --> 14:44.093
basketball and lacrosse team.

14:44.127 --> 14:47.863
Arianna builds houses in Haiti
on her summer vacations. I mean,

14:47.898 --> 14:50.433
somebody get these girls some
wings to go with their halos.

14:50.467 --> 14:52.768
Right. I don't like 'em.
They said that they were

14:52.803 --> 14:55.705
friends with Molly, but
according to her cell records,

14:55.739 --> 14:57.740
she never texted
or called them.

14:57.774 --> 14:59.108
Who did Molly call or text?

14:59.142 --> 15:00.843
Her parents.

15:00.877 --> 15:03.412
But three days before the
murder, there's a huge spike

15:03.447 --> 15:05.181
in her cell
data activity.

15:05.215 --> 15:06.649
Angela's looking into that

15:06.683 --> 15:08.284
to see what it's all about.

15:08.318 --> 15:10.853
Now, this... is interesting.

15:10.887 --> 15:12.421
A shoebox?

15:12.456 --> 15:14.056
"Someone do the world a favor

15:14.091 --> 15:17.460
and get brace face
some deodorant."

15:17.494 --> 15:19.395
Shoebox of insults.

15:19.429 --> 15:21.697
These are Post-its,
photos of scrawls

15:21.732 --> 15:24.767
on bathroom stalls, notes
passed in class. I mean,

15:24.801 --> 15:26.602
this girl was being persecuted.

15:26.637 --> 15:28.638
Why would she hold on to these?

15:28.672 --> 15:30.039
I'd say it's a hate-box.

15:30.073 --> 15:31.633
I mean, Molly kept them
as psychological

15:31.642 --> 15:33.376
verification of all

15:33.410 --> 15:35.711
the terrible things
that she thought about herself.

15:35.746 --> 15:38.080
Wow.

15:38.115 --> 15:39.949
I wasn't expecting
an answer there, Aubrey.

15:39.983 --> 15:41.450
Yeah, I know.

15:41.485 --> 15:43.286
I called one
of the department's profilers.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.854
Then this diary makes sense.

15:44.888 --> 15:46.956
"I hate them!
I hate them! I hate them!

15:46.990 --> 15:50.493
Why won't they let me be happy?
I wish I were dead"?

15:50.527 --> 15:54.263
"Kathryn says I'll wind up
alone, a miserable joke."

15:54.298 --> 15:57.233
She was tormented.
Yeah, she was.

15:57.267 --> 15:59.168
"They're going to be
so disappointed in me.

15:59.202 --> 16:00.836
"I don't blame them.

16:00.871 --> 16:04.640
"I know it's my fault that
no one wants to be my friend.

16:04.675 --> 16:08.377
There's just something wrong
with me."

16:08.412 --> 16:09.812
This poor kid.

16:09.846 --> 16:11.480
Who-Who's "they"?

16:11.515 --> 16:14.350
Her parents,
but I'm more interested

16:14.384 --> 16:15.851
in who this Kathryn is.

16:15.886 --> 16:17.653
Look at that.

16:17.688 --> 16:21.223
Huh. Looks like Molly was gonna
turn in our friend Kathryn

16:21.258 --> 16:24.860
for having a drinking party
in her dorm room every Thursday.

16:24.895 --> 16:27.496
Molly was murdered
Thursday night.

16:31.968 --> 16:33.669
Well, look at this.

16:33.704 --> 16:36.539
The woman who is definitely
not six months pregnant

16:36.573 --> 16:38.574
needs to sit.

16:38.608 --> 16:40.176
I'd prefer to focus on the case.

16:40.210 --> 16:42.678
Okay.

16:49.853 --> 16:51.287
You doing okay?

16:51.321 --> 16:54.990
The victim owned every book
I ever wrote.

16:55.025 --> 16:57.093
Your murder mysteries?

16:57.127 --> 16:59.095
No. The real ones.

16:59.129 --> 17:02.398
The textbooks
and technical manuals.

17:02.432 --> 17:04.099
And the notes she wrote

17:04.134 --> 17:07.569
in the margins are
exceptionally astute.

17:07.604 --> 17:09.137
Well, according to Booth,

17:09.172 --> 17:11.640
she had a lot
of free time to study.

17:11.675 --> 17:14.242
I assume you mean

17:14.277 --> 17:16.912
because she didn't have
many friends.

17:16.946 --> 17:19.214
Mm.
Intellectually,

17:19.249 --> 17:23.452
she was probably bored by
frivolous adolescent concerns.

17:23.487 --> 17:25.688
Yeah. Poor girl.

17:25.722 --> 17:28.290
She must have been
really lonely.

17:28.325 --> 17:30.860
The other girls ostracized her

17:30.894 --> 17:34.597
because she was different,
and they felt threatened.

17:34.631 --> 17:37.032
Making conclusions

17:37.067 --> 17:40.469
without all the facts
is not like you.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.740
I'm using my own life
as a reference.

17:46.376 --> 17:49.044
Now I have perspective, but...

17:49.079 --> 17:52.415
then, when I was isolated
like Molly...

17:54.618 --> 17:58.587
...it was difficult to imagine
that I would ever find a life

17:58.622 --> 18:01.090
that I would enjoy living.

18:03.427 --> 18:06.695
You never tried to cozy
up to the popular kids?

18:06.730 --> 18:09.231
I could accurately predict

18:09.266 --> 18:12.134
what their response
would be, so, no.

18:12.169 --> 18:14.537
Oh.

18:14.571 --> 18:16.505
I'm sorry, Brennan.

18:16.540 --> 18:19.341
I have a wonderful life.

18:21.211 --> 18:24.613
I'm sorry for Molly
that she never got the chance

18:24.648 --> 18:28.551
to realize
that she could have one, too.

18:30.187 --> 18:33.956
Well, Booth and Aubrey said
that she did try to fit in,

18:33.990 --> 18:37.026
but that she was
rejected every time.

18:37.060 --> 18:39.962
It was mostly by this
girl named Kathryn.

18:39.996 --> 18:42.765
Now, there were three
Kathryns at Pemberley,

18:42.799 --> 18:44.533
but look at this one.

18:48.305 --> 18:51.073
Kathryn Walling.
Those beads.

18:51.107 --> 18:53.973
They look like a match for the
ones found at the crime scene.

18:53.974 --> 18:54.521
Yeah.

18:54.544 --> 18:56.946
You're right.
The necklace wasn't Molly's.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.281
It was Kathryn Walling's.

19:01.251 --> 19:03.619
<i>"I wish Ms. Minchin</i>

19:03.653 --> 19:07.356
"knew what an evil bitch
Kathryn really is.

19:07.390 --> 19:09.825
"But all she sees is
the perfect young lady,

19:09.860 --> 19:11.627
"the athlete
and perfect student.

19:11.661 --> 19:14.396
"If only she knew that Kathryn
breaks every single rule

19:14.431 --> 19:16.332
in the Honor Code."

19:16.366 --> 19:19.168
That is totally
a gross exaggeration.

19:19.202 --> 19:21.370
You're all through this
diary. You tormented her.

19:21.404 --> 19:25.007
She says, "I wish I was dead"
over a dozen times in here.

19:25.041 --> 19:27.643
We have witnesses who
say that you and Molly

19:27.677 --> 19:29.245
got into a fight on Thursday.

19:29.279 --> 19:30.846
The day Molly was murdered.

19:30.881 --> 19:33.916
Look, Molly was weird.

19:33.950 --> 19:35.484
Everyone thought so.

19:35.519 --> 19:37.486
- But I did not kill her.
- Okay.

19:37.521 --> 19:41.223
Did you and Molly get into
a fight on Thursday afternoon?

19:43.894 --> 19:45.995
Yes.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.563
I came home from classes

19:47.597 --> 19:49.565
and found her snooping
in my room.

19:49.599 --> 19:51.267
Why didn't you report that
to the headmistress?

19:51.301 --> 19:54.603
If I reported every single thing
Molly Delson did...

19:54.638 --> 19:56.038
She might still be alive.

19:56.072 --> 19:57.306
Okay, okay,
Agent Booth,

19:57.340 --> 19:58.974
I will remind you
we are dealing

19:59.009 --> 20:00.743
with a 16-year-old girl.

20:00.777 --> 20:02.344
Are we referring
to Kathryn here,

20:02.379 --> 20:04.813
or the 16-year-old girl
who was murdered?

20:06.283 --> 20:09.084
What was Molly
doing in your room?

20:09.119 --> 20:11.287
Well, obviously, she was
stealing my necklace.

20:11.321 --> 20:13.656
Molly was planning
on telling Ms. Minchin

20:13.690 --> 20:15.457
about your drinking parties.

20:15.492 --> 20:19.328
Wha...? What?

20:21.031 --> 20:23.132
Okay, I'm more than willing

20:23.166 --> 20:26.902
to take responsibility
for my actions, even if

20:26.937 --> 20:28.971
admitting it could
get me suspended.

20:29.005 --> 20:31.740
But I won't admit
to something that I didn't do.

20:31.775 --> 20:34.076
And I certainly didn't
kill Molly.

20:34.110 --> 20:36.412
Who was in your room drinking
with you Thursday night?

20:38.848 --> 20:42.351
Cayla Seligman
and Arianna Donas.

20:46.122 --> 20:47.957
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Hodgins?

20:47.991 --> 20:50.659
Yeah, so, I ran samples
of Molly's clothes

20:50.694 --> 20:53.095
through the GC Mass Spec,
and I found traces

20:53.129 --> 20:56.999
of <i>Celastrus</i> <i>scandens,</i>
wall-climbing ivy.

20:57.033 --> 20:59.034
From where her body was found?
No.

20:59.069 --> 21:03.272
The only place that we could
find any was... Molly's dorm.

21:03.306 --> 21:04.907
Oh.
Yeah.

21:04.941 --> 21:07.076
And I found a couple
of white paint chips

21:07.110 --> 21:10.045
that match the type of paint
used on the trellises.

21:10.080 --> 21:11.981
She climbed out the window
on her own.

21:12.015 --> 21:13.415
Which means
she wasn't kidnapped.

21:13.450 --> 21:14.984
So where was she going?

21:15.018 --> 21:17.186
And who did she meet?

21:22.461 --> 21:24.829
She probably snuck out to meet
a boy, could be the killer,

21:24.864 --> 21:26.264
so Aubrey's going through
the diary

21:26.298 --> 21:27.599
to make a list of names.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.434
Well, everything
will help.

21:29.468 --> 21:30.788
I want you to know
that I remember

21:30.803 --> 21:32.504
every single time
we've made love.

21:33.506 --> 21:36.207
W... w, right, yeah.

21:36.242 --> 21:37.475
That, uh, came out of nowhere.

21:37.510 --> 21:38.643
I guess I'm flattered.

21:38.677 --> 21:40.512
No, I have
an exceptional memory.

21:40.546 --> 21:41.813
Yeah. That.

21:41.847 --> 21:43.014
Uh-huh.

21:43.048 --> 21:44.482
I believe that

21:44.517 --> 21:46.618
I got pregnant
the night you made ravioli.

21:46.652 --> 21:49.954
No, no. It definitely was
the Brunello night.

21:49.989 --> 21:52.257
The baked eggplant
was just perfect.

21:52.291 --> 21:55.627
Impossible. Booth, no,
that was way too long ago.

21:55.661 --> 21:59.164
No, long enough to make you
look this, um...

22:01.901 --> 22:03.201
...beautiful.

22:03.235 --> 22:05.904
This...

22:05.938 --> 22:07.439
beautiful thing here.

22:07.473 --> 22:09.140
Beautiful person.

22:09.175 --> 22:11.676
I'm this size because
I've been pregnant before

22:11.710 --> 22:13.745
and I have an appropriately
healthy appetite.

22:13.779 --> 22:15.447
Right, yeah, I'm sorry.

22:15.481 --> 22:17.415
I'm sorry.

22:17.450 --> 22:20.718
Usually you're so focused
on the-the science and the facts

22:20.753 --> 22:22.220
about the case...

22:22.254 --> 22:23.721
Am I missing something here?

22:23.756 --> 22:25.457
No. Nothing.

22:25.491 --> 22:26.458
Okay, I just thought that...

22:26.492 --> 22:27.759
Can we talk about
the case, please?

22:27.793 --> 22:30.295
Okay.

22:30.329 --> 22:32.297
We got...

22:32.331 --> 22:34.232
Oh. FBI techs have
a bag of stuff

22:34.266 --> 22:36.334
that they pulled from the stream
where Molly's body was found.

22:36.368 --> 22:38.803
They're dropping it off
at the lab. How about that?

22:39.672 --> 22:42.907
♪ ♪

22:47.246 --> 22:49.147
Thank you.

22:50.583 --> 22:53.151
Oh.

22:53.185 --> 22:54.619
That looks about the size that
would've caused the stab wounds.

22:54.653 --> 22:56.254
Yeah, seriously.

22:56.288 --> 22:58.656
All right, I'm going to swab
the blade for particulates.

22:58.691 --> 23:00.291
I wish there
was another way

23:00.326 --> 23:02.193
to tie the scissors
to the case.

23:02.228 --> 23:04.162
Uh, fingerprints?

23:04.196 --> 23:05.430
Fingerprints?

23:05.464 --> 23:06.865
They've been in water for days.

23:06.899 --> 23:10.001
Please, and I thought
that you were the optimist.

23:10.035 --> 23:12.270
Because I've been anticipating
Jake wanting to sleep with me?

23:12.304 --> 23:13.671
Wow.

23:13.706 --> 23:15.106
That was a leap.

23:15.140 --> 23:17.842
No.
I was just going to suggest

23:17.877 --> 23:19.143
that we run the scissors

23:19.178 --> 23:21.513
through a little cyanoacrylate
fumigation.

23:21.547 --> 23:23.047
Of course. Sorry.

23:23.082 --> 23:24.916
No, no need to apologize.

23:24.950 --> 23:26.584
That's good.

23:26.619 --> 23:28.186
Well, let's wait until
they've been fumigated

23:28.220 --> 23:29.487
before celebrating.

23:29.522 --> 23:31.422
No, I meant about Jake,
not the scissors.

23:31.457 --> 23:33.992
It must feel nice to be wanted.

23:34.026 --> 23:35.994
It does.

23:36.028 --> 23:37.896
And terrible.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.697
Like I'm being unfaithful.

23:39.732 --> 23:43.935
Well, yeah, it's got to be
complicated and confusing.

23:43.969 --> 23:45.937
Yes, and I don't like
either of those things.

23:45.971 --> 23:48.072
I'm a single, widowed mother.

23:48.107 --> 23:50.675
I don't know if I'm ready
to just move on.

23:50.709 --> 23:53.611
No matter how sweet
and attractive Jake is.

23:53.646 --> 23:55.513
Listen, Daisy...

23:55.548 --> 23:56.915
No, thank you.

23:56.949 --> 23:58.216
Let's start fumigating.

23:58.250 --> 23:59.851
Okay.

23:59.885 --> 24:01.486
<i>This influx</i>

24:01.520 --> 24:03.288
of data on Molly's cell bill

24:03.322 --> 24:05.590
was caused by a ton
of text messages.

24:05.624 --> 24:07.091
Between Molly
and her parents?

24:07.126 --> 24:09.627
No. Hardly any of these
were outgoing.

24:09.662 --> 24:11.896
She was receiving texts?
Mm-hmm.

24:11.931 --> 24:14.232
She's supposed to be
lonely and isolated.

24:14.266 --> 24:15.900
Yeah. Here's why.

24:15.935 --> 24:18.369
These are awful texts.

24:18.404 --> 24:20.872
"Where you been hiding,
Double-D?

24:20.906 --> 24:22.774
"Thanks to those, I've now

24:22.808 --> 24:24.876
"coined the term motor-yachting.

24:24.910 --> 24:26.878
How about a free ride?"

24:26.912 --> 24:28.813
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

24:28.847 --> 24:31.616
These texts came from
all over the country.

24:31.650 --> 24:33.418
So, why the sudden influx?

24:33.452 --> 24:35.887
A nude photo of Molly
was posted on the Web,

24:35.921 --> 24:37.822
with her phone number.

24:37.856 --> 24:40.491
Oh, God, no, no, but we're not gonna
have to look at that, though, are we?

24:40.526 --> 24:42.694
No, no, we'll save that
for the prosecutor.

24:42.728 --> 24:44.429
But it is degrading.

24:44.463 --> 24:47.632
Molly doesn't really seem like
the sexting kind of girl.

24:47.666 --> 24:49.067
It's not a selfie.

24:49.101 --> 24:51.002
So, someone snapped
a photo of Molly,

24:51.036 --> 24:52.570
put it on the Internet?

24:52.605 --> 24:54.806
Okay, is there any way to trace
who took the picture?

24:54.840 --> 24:56.708
Well, I checked every copy
I could find

24:56.742 --> 24:58.276
for the original metadata.

24:58.310 --> 25:01.913
Now, does this name
mean anything to you?

25:01.947 --> 25:04.882
I'll be damned.

25:06.785 --> 25:08.319
It's not a big deal.

25:08.354 --> 25:09.854
She was underage.

25:09.888 --> 25:12.156
You took that photo of her
and you distributed it, okay?

25:12.191 --> 25:14.993
That is
child pornography, Tyler.

25:15.027 --> 25:16.628
She told me she was 18.

25:16.662 --> 25:18.296
Did you have sex
with her, too?

25:18.330 --> 25:19.464
What? No!

25:19.498 --> 25:20.999
I only met her
that one time.

25:21.033 --> 25:22.100
Time you killed her?

25:22.134 --> 25:23.267
No!

25:23.302 --> 25:24.736
A few days before
she disappeared.

25:24.770 --> 25:26.204
She offered to pose for me,

25:26.238 --> 25:28.006
I said yes.
Oh, really?

25:28.040 --> 25:29.374
And why did she offer
to do that, huh?

25:29.408 --> 25:31.609
Your charm? Your good looks?

25:31.644 --> 25:32.910
Pills.

25:32.945 --> 25:34.579
Pills!

25:34.613 --> 25:36.180
Those private school girls,
they all want Ritalin

25:36.215 --> 25:37.715
or Adderall to study.

25:37.750 --> 25:38.983
Oh, so you're a drug dealer.

25:39.018 --> 25:43.221
I consider myself
more of an academic coach.

25:43.255 --> 25:44.789
Here's what I think happened.

25:44.823 --> 25:47.225
I think Molly saw you selling
to the other girls,

25:47.259 --> 25:48.660
she called it cheating,

25:48.694 --> 25:49.994
threatened to turn you in
for the dealing,

25:50.029 --> 25:51.295
so you killed her.

25:51.330 --> 25:53.331
No, no.

25:53.365 --> 25:56.134
I'm telling you,
she did it for the pills.

25:56.168 --> 25:57.969
Benzos.

25:58.003 --> 26:01.572
So why isn't there any sign of
benzodiazepine in her tissue?

26:01.607 --> 26:03.041
I don't know.

26:03.075 --> 26:04.609
Science is not my thing.

26:04.643 --> 26:07.178
Yeah, making up a story
isn't your thing either.

26:07.212 --> 26:09.313
Benzodiazepine is not
an upper like Ritalin, Tyler,

26:09.348 --> 26:10.782
it's a sedative.

26:10.816 --> 26:14.052
Well, then she needed
to relax, I guess.

26:14.086 --> 26:16.087
I don't know,
she was high-strung.

26:17.222 --> 26:19.857
Why did you post her photo?

26:20.959 --> 26:22.660
I don't know.

26:22.695 --> 26:24.495
I do.

26:24.530 --> 26:27.598
So you could share it
with all the other pervs.

26:27.633 --> 26:31.869
I am really going to enjoy
locking you up.

26:40.484 --> 26:43.053
- You're right.
- It's a puncture wound, right?

26:43.054 --> 26:44.121
I believe so.

26:44.122 --> 26:45.722
I'm sorry I didn't see
it the first time.

26:45.757 --> 26:48.536
You caught it, Ms. Wick,
even though it was obfuscated

26:48.537 --> 26:51.972
by remodeled fractures from
the victim's childhood obesity.

26:52.007 --> 26:53.774
If Agent Booth were killed
in the line of duty,

26:53.809 --> 26:56.677
would you go to bed with
another man six months later?

26:56.712 --> 26:59.213
Booth will not be killed.

26:59.247 --> 27:01.382
Lance was a psychologist
and he got killed.

27:01.416 --> 27:03.384
Booth is an actual agent.

27:03.418 --> 27:04.985
You have to admit,
that's a high-risk job.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.654
Actually, you both
have high-risk jobs.

27:06.688 --> 27:08.689
This conversation is not
pertinent to the case.

27:08.724 --> 27:10.458
I know, but would you?

27:10.492 --> 27:14.095
Uh, sex is a need
like hunger or sleep,

27:14.129 --> 27:15.496
Ms. Wick.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.365
Why won't you just answer?

27:20.268 --> 27:21.869
No.

27:21.903 --> 27:23.471
I wouldn't.

27:23.505 --> 27:24.538
Then why would I?

27:24.573 --> 27:25.573
I should,

27:25.574 --> 27:26.874
if the situation arose.

27:26.908 --> 27:30.077
It makes no logical sense,
but I wouldn't.

27:30.112 --> 27:31.612
This is getting us nowhere.

27:31.646 --> 27:33.614
The puncture wound
to the lateral aspect

27:33.648 --> 27:36.584
of the femoral neck suggests
the victim was injected.

27:36.618 --> 27:38.519
But the tox screen
came back negative.

27:38.553 --> 27:40.087
We should check again

27:40.122 --> 27:42.056
because I'm obviously
seeing things incorrectly

27:42.090 --> 27:43.524
or not seeing them at all.

27:43.558 --> 27:45.493
You mean the situation
with me and Jake and Lance

27:45.527 --> 27:47.862
and you and your baby and
Booth and love and death?

27:47.896 --> 27:49.530
No.

27:49.564 --> 27:51.899
It's possible the victim
was injected with something

27:51.933 --> 27:54.668
that has an extremely fast
metabolic breakdown.

27:54.703 --> 27:57.505
Have Dr. Hodgins swab
the puncture wound.

27:57.539 --> 28:01.142
There may be residue
on the bone.

28:06.081 --> 28:10.017
Tyler's car came up negative
for any signs of Molly.

28:10.051 --> 28:11.685
Well, that guy's a freak
and a perv

28:11.720 --> 28:13.821
but he's definitely not
a murderer.

28:13.855 --> 28:15.623
He sure seemed like
a murderer to me.

28:15.657 --> 28:18.993
But I guess guilt is in the eye
of the beholder.

28:19.027 --> 28:20.461
Everything's in the eye
of the beholder.

28:20.495 --> 28:21.996
It doesn't make any sense.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.597
Why... why would Molly

28:23.632 --> 28:26.934
degrade herself for drugs
and not take them?

28:26.968 --> 28:29.603
Maybe she was saving them
for later?

28:29.638 --> 28:31.906
Nah, we would've found them--
we didn't find them anywhere.

28:31.940 --> 28:33.641
So, she got them for a friend?

28:34.409 --> 28:35.910
Right. No friends.

28:35.944 --> 28:37.711
Okay, so maybe she got them
to make friends?

28:37.746 --> 28:41.382
Or because she was bullied
into getting them?

28:41.416 --> 28:42.550
Whose trunk was she in?

28:42.584 --> 28:43.851
I mean, where was she going?

28:43.885 --> 28:45.119
Who was she going to see?

28:45.153 --> 28:46.420
We got more questions
than answers here

28:46.454 --> 28:47.755
and we're definitely
missing something.

28:47.789 --> 28:49.490
Yeah, but what?

28:49.524 --> 28:51.091
I don't know. Why don't you take
a look at this diary again,

28:51.126 --> 28:52.760
see if you can find anything.

28:57.833 --> 29:00.501
This is definitely
the murder weapon.

29:00.535 --> 29:03.037
I found matching
particulates

29:03.071 --> 29:05.806
for the glue, construction paper
and glitter.

29:05.841 --> 29:07.081
Any luck with the fingerprints?

29:07.108 --> 29:08.475
We're about to find out.

29:08.510 --> 29:11.512
So, you add a little bit
of superglue, right.

29:11.546 --> 29:16.183
Then you put it in an airtight
heated chamber.

29:16.218 --> 29:19.820
Now, once the actual
superglue boils,

29:19.855 --> 29:22.523
the vapors will
reveal any fingerprints

29:22.557 --> 29:25.392
that survived submersion
in the stream.

29:25.427 --> 29:27.194
Did you get the
results back

29:27.229 --> 29:28.729
from the puncture
wound swab?

29:28.763 --> 29:31.599
Uh, no, it's still
in the Mass Spec.

29:31.633 --> 29:33.567
Well, I did a localized
fat tox screen

29:33.602 --> 29:34.869
on the corresponding tissue.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.604
As I expected,
it came back negative,

29:36.638 --> 29:38.372
but I took another
look at the tendons

29:38.406 --> 29:41.809
and I'm pretty sure they
weren't torn by predation.

29:41.843 --> 29:43.043
They happened before death?

29:43.078 --> 29:45.012
During the struggle?

29:45.046 --> 29:46.780
Which would indicate
that either her assailant

29:46.815 --> 29:49.350
was extremely strong
or there was more than one.

29:51.086 --> 29:52.486
Okay, all right.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.590
So... because the chemical
deposits are white

29:56.625 --> 30:00.160
and the handles are white,

30:00.195 --> 30:01.629
we're going to need to dust

30:01.663 --> 30:06.267
in order to find contrast.

30:09.537 --> 30:11.171
That's not a fingerprint.

30:11.206 --> 30:12.873
No.

30:12.908 --> 30:16.043
Cyanoacrylate fuming also reacts
with other latent chemicals.

30:16.077 --> 30:19.213
So I'm guessing
this is some kind of resin.

30:20.649 --> 30:22.349
It looks like letters--
is it a word?

30:22.384 --> 30:24.551
It's a name.
Cayla.

30:24.586 --> 30:26.654
These are her scissors.

30:26.688 --> 30:29.890
Cayla isn't big or strong enough
to kill her alone.

30:29.925 --> 30:32.860
Someone had to help her
kill Molly Delson.

30:38.266 --> 30:41.735
So, squints put Cayla Seligman
at the crime scene.

30:41.770 --> 30:44.271
Which means that Kathryn
Walling's alibi is shot.

30:44.306 --> 30:46.140
And since all three used
each other as alibis

30:46.174 --> 30:48.475
and the squints think that
there were multiple killers...

30:48.510 --> 30:50.411
One of those girls
must have a car.

30:50.445 --> 30:51.946
All right, get a warrant
and search the trunk.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.414
Me and Bones will talk
to the girls.

30:53.448 --> 30:54.548
You got it.

30:54.582 --> 30:56.050
<i>I'm going to set</i>

30:56.084 --> 30:57.551
some ground rules here.

30:57.585 --> 30:59.219
If I feel the questioning
becomes too aggressive,

30:59.254 --> 31:01.655
I will stop and call in
the girls' parents.

31:01.690 --> 31:02.890
Well, there's no need
to get aggressive

31:02.924 --> 31:04.291
if everybody
tells the truth.

31:04.326 --> 31:06.660
The truth isn't always
easy to accept.

31:06.695 --> 31:09.096
Sometimes it's hard to
open our eyes to it.

31:09.130 --> 31:10.965
Which is why we brought
scientific evidence.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.466
Isn't that right, Bones?

31:12.500 --> 31:13.934
Yes, but I'm just saying
that Ms. Minchin might have

31:13.969 --> 31:15.536
to question her own instincts
and beliefs.

31:15.570 --> 31:16.704
Which are what?

31:16.738 --> 31:19.473
To protect these girls
and your institution.

31:19.507 --> 31:20.941
Is there something wrong
with that?

31:20.976 --> 31:23.177
Only if it helps three
murderers go free.

31:23.211 --> 31:24.745
Oh, my God,
do you mean us?

31:25.914 --> 31:28.248
We have forensic evidence
that ties

31:28.283 --> 31:29.817
all three of you
to Molly's murder.

31:29.851 --> 31:32.119
Those your scissors, Cayla?

31:32.153 --> 31:33.454
So?
So...

31:33.488 --> 31:35.823
those scissors were found
where Molly was murdered.

31:35.857 --> 31:37.157
You're looking
at the murder weapon.

31:37.192 --> 31:39.259
Somebody stabbed Molly
with my scissors?

31:39.294 --> 31:41.395
And guess whose car
was used to move Molly

31:41.429 --> 31:43.163
to the woods,
Arianna.

31:43.198 --> 31:45.332
My car? That's impossible.
I haven't taken it out

31:45.367 --> 31:46.834
in, like, a week.
The text

31:46.868 --> 31:49.103
Agent Booth received
a moment ago confirmed

31:49.137 --> 31:51.038
that traces of Molly's
hair and blood were found

31:51.072 --> 31:52.706
in the trunk of your car.

31:52.741 --> 31:54.141
Ms. Minchin, this is crazy.

31:54.175 --> 31:55.909
Okay, can I ask a question?

31:55.944 --> 31:59.613
I already told you Molly was
a jealous little klepto sneak.

31:59.647 --> 32:02.683
She stole my necklace,
why not Cayla's scissors?

32:02.717 --> 32:04.151
What about Arianna's car?

32:04.185 --> 32:07.221
As captain of Pemberley's

32:07.255 --> 32:08.622
mock trial team, I can

32:08.656 --> 32:10.057
tell you your argument
is both specious

32:10.091 --> 32:11.759
and circumstantial.

32:11.793 --> 32:13.260
You have no proof
that her hair

32:13.294 --> 32:14.695
or blood was there
because of us.

32:14.729 --> 32:16.263
Not to mention
that it is permissible

32:16.297 --> 32:18.699
for police to lie to
suspects during interrogations.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.501
Two of you held her down. She

32:20.535 --> 32:22.036
fought back.
You kicked her,

32:22.070 --> 32:23.370
fracturing her ribs.

32:23.405 --> 32:25.105
You yanked her arm
out of its socket.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.507
But that
wasn't enough.

32:26.541 --> 32:28.275
No, one of you picked up those

32:28.309 --> 32:30.144
scissors and stabbed her
not once,

32:30.178 --> 32:33.047
not twice, but 12 times
before she died.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.915
Dr. Brennan.
No, that's

32:34.949 --> 32:37.951
not true, because we were all
in Kathryn's room, drinking.

32:37.986 --> 32:40.054
What? Uh...
Okay, "we"?

32:40.088 --> 32:41.889
Molly brought some booze.

32:41.923 --> 32:43.390
One of those
half bottles of vodka.

32:43.425 --> 32:45.559
She said she wanted
to be friends.

32:45.593 --> 32:46.593
What happened next?

32:46.628 --> 32:48.062
Nothing.
Nothing?

32:48.096 --> 32:49.563
We all woke up
the next morning at 8:00 a.m.

32:49.597 --> 32:51.432
Except... Molly
wasn't there.

32:51.466 --> 32:53.734
You all passed out?
They're 16-year-old

32:53.768 --> 32:55.969
girls, they aren't used to drinking.
There isn't enough alcohol

32:56.004 --> 32:59.098
in a pint bottle of vodka
for all of you to black out.

32:59.099 --> 33:02.343
Look, I'm sorry I was mean to Molly.
I'm sorry I bullied her

33:02.377 --> 33:04.978
and I wish I could take it back.
But I'm not a killer.

33:05.013 --> 33:06.447
I'm sorry, that's not
enough. You're all

33:06.481 --> 33:08.549
under arrest for the
murder of Molly Delson.

33:23.565 --> 33:25.533
Booth.
All right. All right, I got it.

33:25.567 --> 33:28.135
No, I... I've been
reading the same page

33:28.170 --> 33:30.338
for 15 minutes.
I just...

33:30.372 --> 33:32.540
I just keep thinking
about those girls.

33:32.574 --> 33:34.642
Their story
made no sense at all.

33:34.676 --> 33:36.243
That's the one
thing that bugs me.

33:36.278 --> 33:38.279
What, that their story
was stupid?

33:38.313 --> 33:40.214
Yes.
Why?

33:40.248 --> 33:42.016
Because they
aren't stupid.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.285
You think they're innocent?
I think that they're mean.

33:44.319 --> 33:46.153
I think that they're bullies,
but I don't think that

33:46.188 --> 33:48.089
they, uh, murdered Molly.

33:48.123 --> 33:49.924
That's one of those gut things
I have that you're gonna

33:49.958 --> 33:51.993
laugh at me for.
I'm not laughing at you.

33:52.027 --> 33:54.829
Why not?
Because

33:54.863 --> 33:58.899
evidence can always be explained
by more than one story.

33:58.934 --> 34:02.136
Hmm. Okay, so then
what do we do now?

34:02.170 --> 34:04.605
We look at the evidence
again, we...

34:04.640 --> 34:06.974
we search for another story,

34:07.009 --> 34:08.976
we find the truth.
Whoa, whoa,

34:09.011 --> 34:12.513
whoa, whoa, wai-wait a second-- now?
We... Of course, why not?

34:12.547 --> 34:14.649
This is the best time.
I'm gonna go to the lab

34:14.683 --> 34:17.150
and look at everything again.
No, no, it's... this is not the best time.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.485
Love you.

34:23.792 --> 34:26.694
Hi. Is everything
all right?

34:26.728 --> 34:28.329
It's almost
10:00 at night.

34:28.362 --> 34:29.730
Thank you
for meeting me.

34:29.764 --> 34:31.866
Yeah. Well, you
called Hodgins in,

34:31.900 --> 34:33.601
so I didn't have
anything else to do.

34:33.635 --> 34:35.603
Oh.

34:35.637 --> 34:38.039
Honey, I was joking.

34:38.072 --> 34:40.074
You're really important
to me, obviously.

34:40.108 --> 34:42.076
What's... What's wrong?

34:42.110 --> 34:45.146
My size.

34:45.179 --> 34:48.382
Oh. Well, you'll
lose the weight after

34:48.417 --> 34:50.985
the baby's born.
Not... Not that.

34:51.018 --> 34:53.654
Activity in the amygdala
has been shown to increase

34:53.688 --> 34:56.724
with hormonal changes
during pregnancy.

34:56.757 --> 34:58.426
Oh. So...

34:58.460 --> 35:00.428
you're saying I was right.

35:00.462 --> 35:03.230
Essentially, yes.

35:04.599 --> 35:06.300
I-I... I'm six months pregnant.

35:06.334 --> 35:09.203
I have to be.
I just didn't...

35:09.237 --> 35:11.305
just didn't want to be.

35:13.308 --> 35:16.143
Well, I'm not gonna
argue with that.

35:16.178 --> 35:18.713
I tried to convince myself
that maybe I was having twins.

35:18.747 --> 35:20.781
But the doctor would know
if I were having twins.

35:20.816 --> 35:22.550
Yes, she would.

35:22.584 --> 35:24.618
Then why do I
keep trying

35:24.653 --> 35:27.521
to insist that I am
less pregnant than I am?

35:27.556 --> 35:29.657
It makes no sense.

35:29.691 --> 35:32.560
Sweets would say
it's because you're

35:32.594 --> 35:34.594
trying to control something
that you can't control.

35:34.596 --> 35:36.230
But what do you say?

35:37.499 --> 35:40.634
I agree. I think
it makes you question

35:40.669 --> 35:44.605
whether having another child
is the right thing to do.

35:45.941 --> 35:47.341
No, we-we're both very happy

35:47.375 --> 35:49.543
about having another child.

35:49.578 --> 35:51.078
I'm sure.

35:51.113 --> 35:52.680
But you're smart, Brennan.

35:52.714 --> 35:54.682
Brilliant.
Right, so

35:54.716 --> 35:56.584
you must have
thought about your work.

35:56.618 --> 35:58.385
About what you and Booth do.

35:58.420 --> 35:59.787
I love what I do.

35:59.821 --> 36:01.922
So does Booth.
Yeah,

36:01.957 --> 36:04.325
we all do, but we don't
like being shot at

36:04.359 --> 36:07.194
or seeing somebody we love die

36:07.229 --> 36:09.730
or seeing them locked up.

36:11.166 --> 36:15.402
In one second,
everything can just change.

36:15.437 --> 36:18.239
Your children
could be left with no one.

36:18.273 --> 36:22.109
And not being able
to control that...

36:22.144 --> 36:24.612
is really scary.

36:24.646 --> 36:28.115
But...

36:28.150 --> 36:31.719
that's just the price we pay
for the things that we love.

36:41.263 --> 36:44.999
Hey. So Booth's gut
may have been right.

36:45.033 --> 36:48.736
Yes. I should have this baby
in about three months.

36:48.770 --> 36:50.905
And I'm not sleeping
with Jake. Not yet.

36:50.939 --> 36:54.475
Okay... good to know.
Anyway,

36:54.509 --> 36:57.244
I got the results back
from the puncture wound swab.

36:57.279 --> 36:59.480
It's positive for Lidocaine.

36:59.514 --> 37:02.249
But the victim
bought benzodiazepine.

37:02.284 --> 37:04.552
Lidocaine is a nerve blocker.
Meaning

37:04.586 --> 37:06.520
when Molly was killed,
she was numb to the pain?

37:06.555 --> 37:08.422
Yes.
Does that seem

37:08.456 --> 37:10.991
like something 16-year-old
bully girls would do?

37:11.026 --> 37:13.027
No. Way too creepy.

37:13.061 --> 37:14.728
Why?
Because even though

37:14.763 --> 37:16.630
the victim wouldn't
feel the attack,

37:16.665 --> 37:19.800
she would've been conscious,
watching her own death.

37:19.835 --> 37:21.769
That is freak territory.

37:21.803 --> 37:23.971
It would be unusually cruel.

37:26.341 --> 37:29.643
What? What spark just went off
in your big brain?

37:29.678 --> 37:31.045
We've been deluding ourselves.

37:31.079 --> 37:32.813
I noticed earlier
there's a distinct

37:32.848 --> 37:35.316
lack of injuries
to the victim's left arm.

37:35.350 --> 37:37.818
There are no corresponding
fractures to those

37:37.853 --> 37:39.720
on the right scapula
and glenohumeral joint,

37:39.754 --> 37:41.188
which I would expect to see.

37:41.223 --> 37:42.756
And why is that delusional?
Based on

37:42.791 --> 37:44.558
the handwriting
in Molly's diary,

37:44.593 --> 37:47.027
we know she was left-handed.

37:47.062 --> 37:49.396
W... Wait,
you say that as though

37:49.431 --> 37:50.931
it explains everything,
but it...

37:50.966 --> 37:53.567
I guess we should be
used to this by now.

38:03.111 --> 38:04.845
Booth.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.281
Booth, Booth, wake up. I know
what happened to Molly Delson.

38:07.315 --> 38:08.983
All right, okay, what time is it?
Oh, and also,

38:09.017 --> 38:10.017
I'm-I'm very pregnant,

38:10.051 --> 38:11.452
I'm at least six months.

38:11.486 --> 38:13.254
Whoa, you're having the baby now?
No.

38:13.288 --> 38:15.155
Did you hear what I said?
I know what happened

38:15.190 --> 38:17.758
to Molly Delson.
I should have seen it

38:17.792 --> 38:20.594
right from the beginning,
but I've recently learned

38:20.629 --> 38:23.564
that many issues can cloud the truth.
Just relax, all right?

38:23.598 --> 38:26.567
I'm listening now.
It was there right from the beginning.

38:26.601 --> 38:28.302
The directionality
of the puncture wound,

38:28.336 --> 38:30.471
the stabbings, the fractures,

38:30.505 --> 38:32.139
I-I just didn't
want to see it.

38:32.173 --> 38:34.074
See what?
Molls parents

38:34.109 --> 38:35.809
are dentists, that's where
she got the Lidocaine.

38:35.844 --> 38:37.077
The benzodiazepines,

38:37.112 --> 38:39.380
they weren't for her,
they were for

38:39.414 --> 38:42.738
the mean girls, to put in
the vodka to knock them out.

38:42.739 --> 38:44.986
Bones,
who killed Molly Delson?

38:45.020 --> 38:47.855
Molly Delson killed herself.

38:51.092 --> 38:53.260
<i>We know she was</i>
<i>depressed and suicidal</i>

38:53.295 --> 38:55.562
<i>from her diary,</i>
<i>but we also know that</i>

38:55.597 --> 38:59.500
<i>she couldn't stand the thought</i>
<i>of disappointing her parents.</i>

38:59.534 --> 39:02.469
<i>Kathryn, Cayla and Arianna--</i>

39:02.504 --> 39:04.405
<i>they didn't kill Molly.</i>

39:04.439 --> 39:07.341
<i>But they pushed her</i>
<i>over the edge.</i>

39:07.375 --> 39:10.077
<i>She tried to get revenge</i>
<i>on them by framing them</i>

39:10.111 --> 39:12.112
<i>for her own murder.</i>

39:12.147 --> 39:15.149
<i>She wanted them to suffer</i>
<i>for what they did to her.</i>

39:15.183 --> 39:19.486
<i>Yes. She was lost and in pain.</i>

39:19.521 --> 39:22.589
<i>But she was also brilliant.</i>

39:22.624 --> 39:26.026
<i>She knew exactly what injuries</i>
<i>to inflict on herself,</i>

39:26.061 --> 39:29.196
<i>exactly what clues she should</i>
<i>leave with her body.</i>

39:29.230 --> 39:31.298
<i>It's why she stole</i>
<i>a nerve blocker</i>

39:31.333 --> 39:32.866
<i>from her parents' office--</i>

39:32.901 --> 39:34.401
<i>So she could harm herself</i>

39:34.436 --> 39:38.906
<i>and stay cogent</i>
<i>to finish the job.</i>

39:38.940 --> 39:42.242
<i>She got the benzodiazepines</i>
<i>from Tyler to put in the girls'</i>

39:42.277 --> 39:45.546
<i>alcohol so they couldn't</i>
<i>account for their time.</i>

39:47.415 --> 39:51.285
<i>She was meticulous.</i>

39:51.319 --> 39:52.886
<i>And now...</i>

39:52.921 --> 39:55.723
<i>that beautiful,</i>
<i>brilliant mind is gone</i>

39:55.757 --> 39:59.493
<i>because she couldn't</i>
<i>see a way out.</i>

39:59.527 --> 40:01.462
People delude themselves.

40:01.496 --> 40:05.132
Y... I didn't want to see
the reality of Molly's death

40:05.166 --> 40:08.068
because I couldn't imagine
someone that intelligent

40:08.103 --> 40:10.671
deciding to kill themselves.
You know,

40:10.705 --> 40:12.172
kids delude themselves
all the time.

40:12.207 --> 40:14.408
Molly's parents deluded
themselves into thinking

40:14.442 --> 40:15.509
that she was happy.

40:16.782 --> 40:18.334
I know what she went through.

40:18.335 --> 40:21.370
I just wish that...

40:21.405 --> 40:23.506
instead of convincing herself
that suicide

40:23.540 --> 40:26.309
was the only option...

40:26.343 --> 40:28.678
if she had
someone to talk to,

40:28.712 --> 40:32.482
if she felt safe enough to...

40:33.617 --> 40:37.053
She...
I know.

40:41.558 --> 40:44.260
I have you now.

40:44.294 --> 40:46.662
Yup.

40:46.697 --> 40:49.165
I can tell you how scared I am.

40:49.199 --> 40:51.634
Scared? You?

40:51.667 --> 40:53.502
Yes.

40:53.537 --> 40:56.305
Me.

40:56.340 --> 40:58.274
The reason I convinced myself

40:58.308 --> 41:02.178
I wasn't as pregnant
as I am is...

41:03.247 --> 41:07.450
I just kept thinking...

41:07.484 --> 41:10.386
the more our family grows,

41:10.419 --> 41:12.921
the more we have to lose.

41:12.956 --> 41:16.659
Yeah. On the flip side,
we have more to gain.

41:16.693 --> 41:20.029
Hey. We're gonna
be fine, Bones.

41:22.031 --> 41:23.465
What, faith?

41:23.499 --> 41:25.000
Mm-mm.

41:25.034 --> 41:27.135
Love.

41:28.871 --> 41:31.740
Lots of love.

41:31.774 --> 41:33.642
Okay? Come on.
Come on over here.

41:33.676 --> 41:35.810
I'll take love.
All right. I'll give you love.

41:35.846 --> 41:37.713
Got love in here.
I can feel it.
