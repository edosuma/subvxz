WEBVTT

00:08.308 --> 00:09.476
Hey!

00:09.542 --> 00:11.711
Hey, Victor.
What are you doing?

00:11.778 --> 00:14.047
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm showering.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.416
Yes, I can see that.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.184
But I really don't think
you should be taking advantage

00:18.251 --> 00:19.519
of Calvin's property like this.

00:19.586 --> 00:21.121
It's... it's not right.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.589
Well,
I'm on Calvin's property,

00:22.655 --> 00:24.090
but I'm using your water.

00:24.157 --> 00:25.392
Does that make you feel
any better?

00:25.458 --> 00:28.128
No, it does not make
me feel any better.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.596
Victor.

00:29.662 --> 00:31.564
I know you're not taking
a shower in my yard.

00:31.631 --> 00:33.266
He sure is,
but you know what,

00:33.333 --> 00:35.568
if it makes you feel any better,
he's using my water.

00:36.336 --> 00:39.506
It would make me feel better
if he was wearing pants.

00:41.841 --> 00:43.710
Let me get my paper,
man.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.345
Oh, hey, hey, man.
That's my towel.

00:45.412 --> 00:47.480
And that's my loofah,
but you can keep that.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.418
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

00:51.484 --> 00:52.685
♪ Welcome to the hood. ♪

00:56.523 --> 00:58.258
Oh, what?

00:56.523 --> 00:58.258
Yeah, and then he had the nerve

00:58.324 --> 01:00.093
to ask me for a towel.

01:02.395 --> 01:05.198
Man, ever since Crackhead
Victor lost his house,

01:05.265 --> 01:07.133
he has taken his antics
to a whole new level.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.435
Yeah.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.669
Yeah, if only there was a...

01:09.736 --> 01:11.771
a strong Black man
who could talk to him.

01:11.838 --> 01:13.339
You know,
someone in the neighborhood

01:13.406 --> 01:14.808
who everyone looks up to,

01:14.874 --> 01:17.610
and who just loves getting
in other people's business.

01:17.677 --> 01:18.812
(Malcolm clears throat)

01:20.613 --> 01:23.216
Nope, nope,
not gonna happen.

01:23.283 --> 01:26.186
Every time I try to help him,
I always get burned.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.420
Last time,

01:27.487 --> 01:29.255
he stole the seats
out my truck.

01:29.322 --> 01:31.124
Had to drive to work
in a lawn chair.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.826
Come on, Dave.
We out of here.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.596
(murmuring)

01:36.663 --> 01:38.298
(entry bells jingle)

01:39.466 --> 01:40.834
Hey, guys.

01:40.900 --> 01:43.236
ALL:
Hey, Keisha!

01:43.837 --> 01:46.139
Hey, Uncle Que.

01:46.206 --> 01:49.576
Yo, I heard Keisha just broke
up with Big Time Slim.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.778
Okay, I have always had
a crush on her.

01:51.845 --> 01:53.279
And now that we're
a little bit older,

01:53.346 --> 01:54.647
it's finally time
for me to shoot my shot.

01:54.714 --> 01:56.749
(laughing)

01:58.885 --> 02:01.554
Listen, save your marshmallow
bullets, Cupid.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.357
TREY: Right.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.357
You're not exactly
Keisha's type, bro.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.693
Yeah, man, she likes rappers.
You know, thugs.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.195
Dudes with tattoos
and swag.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.930
You know, basically
everything opposite of you.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.432
Yeah.

02:12.499 --> 02:13.833
Trust me,
I'll get my chance.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.802
And when I do,
I'll be ready.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.337
(chuckles):
Okay.

02:17.403 --> 02:18.471
Bye, Uncle Que.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.510
Thanks, Marty.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.645
(giggling)

02:25.712 --> 02:27.380
(clears throat)
Top of the morning to ya!

02:27.447 --> 02:28.515
Oh.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.588
(laughter)

02:38.892 --> 02:42.228
Well, this has gone too far.

02:42.295 --> 02:43.830
So, Gemma, what's got
your husband's tight khakis

02:43.897 --> 02:45.398
in a bunch?

02:46.399 --> 02:49.235
We just found Victor
napping in our car.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.503
What?

02:50.570 --> 02:51.738
Yeah, he says
the pine smell helps

02:51.804 --> 02:53.473
with his allergies.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.808
Aw... Calvin, honey.

02:55.875 --> 02:57.877
I think it's time for you
to talk to Victor again.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.445
No, babe.

02:59.512 --> 03:01.748
I've been down that road
with him too many times.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.449
It's a dead end.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.352
Calvin,
you watched Victor grow up.

03:06.419 --> 03:07.954
He was like a nephew to you.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.390
Wow, I didn't know you
and Victor were that close.

03:10.456 --> 03:11.624
Oh, are you kidding me?

03:11.691 --> 03:12.926
Calvin loved Victor so much,

03:12.992 --> 03:14.827
that when Victor wanted
to become a barber,

03:14.894 --> 03:17.430
Calvin let him practice
on his hair.

03:17.497 --> 03:19.632
And it was that love
that saved his behind

03:19.699 --> 03:21.935
when he pressed and curled
my hair like Al Sharpton.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.640
Wait, so you guys knew Victor
before he started using?

03:27.707 --> 03:29.309
Yeah.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.978
He got hooked after he was
deployed to Afghanistan.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.980
Oh, what a shame.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.582
He risked his life
for our country,

03:35.648 --> 03:37.383
and then he ended up
on the streets.

03:37.450 --> 03:40.253
You know, the VA has a rehab
program to help veterans.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.654
I could probably get him
some help.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.690
Yeah, you know what,
look, I can handle Victor.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.692
Calvin, you've
done enough.

03:45.758 --> 03:49.228
I once helped
my college roommate kick NoDoz.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.633
Calvin, please go save my man.

03:55.835 --> 03:57.470
Okay, Dave.

03:57.537 --> 03:59.806
Now listen,
in order to help Victor,

03:59.872 --> 04:01.741
first we got to catch him.

03:59.872 --> 04:01.741
Mm-hmm.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.576
And when he's using,
he gets super skittish

04:03.643 --> 04:05.545
when he feels threatened,
so...

04:05.612 --> 04:08.815
we got to treat him
like a wild bear in a mosh pit.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.583
Calvin, I got this.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.519
People don't call me
Speedy Johnson for nothing.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.588
Nobody calls you Speedy Johnson.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.258
Everybody calls me
Speedy Johnson.

04:15.655 --> 04:19.258
Oh, my...

04:20.093 --> 04:21.894
Okay, here comes Victor.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.063
Remember what I said.
Don't move.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.064
Hey, Victor.

04:25.131 --> 04:26.733
Uh...

04:26.799 --> 04:28.468
can I talk to you
for a second?

04:31.804 --> 04:34.574
Go! Go, go, Speedy!

04:39.646 --> 04:41.280
Victor, get back here!

04:46.386 --> 04:47.987
No, Victor, no.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.822
Victor!

05:01.901 --> 05:03.770
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

05:03.836 --> 05:05.605
I got him.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.307
(Dave groans)

05:12.578 --> 05:14.347
Nice haircut, man.

05:12.578 --> 05:14.347
Thanks.

05:21.754 --> 05:22.755
What just happened?

05:22.822 --> 05:24.991
Crack, Dave. Crack happened.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.325
All right,
come on.

05:27.393 --> 05:29.629
Mmm, you know what
this cupcake needs?

05:29.696 --> 05:32.365
A paying customer?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.634
Sorry.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.135
I'm just always hungry
all the time.

05:36.202 --> 05:37.804
I'm eating for two.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.373
Yeah, well, right now
you're eating for free.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.478
Oh, I'm so happy
you're both here.

05:45.545 --> 05:46.779
I'm looking for
some fashion advice

05:46.846 --> 05:48.014
from some cool, hip women.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.615
Oh, thank you, baby.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.615
OH, that's so sweet.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.817
Yeah,
but since I couldn't find any,

05:50.883 --> 05:51.818
I thought I'd come
to you two.

05:53.553 --> 05:54.554
Talk fast, boy.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.489
Okay, okay. Uh...

05:56.556 --> 05:59.459
It's time for me to go
in a new direction,

05:59.525 --> 06:00.526
clothes-wise.

06:00.593 --> 06:02.528
I love any kind of makeover.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.130
Makeup, clothes, bathrooms.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.732
I live for a reveal.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.433
Okay, well,

06:07.500 --> 06:08.935
are you up-to-date on
the latest street fashion?

06:09.001 --> 06:11.804
I'm gonna have to do
some light Instagram stalking,

06:11.871 --> 06:14.974
but I am sure
I can figure it out.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.974
Okay.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.843
Well, since I've got
these cupcake orders to fill,

06:16.909 --> 06:18.678
I'm gonna leave my baby
in your hands.

06:18.745 --> 06:19.679
(gasps)

06:19.746 --> 06:21.914
Oh, hell nah!

06:26.552 --> 06:28.621
First, you eat up
all my cupcakes,

06:28.688 --> 06:31.824
and then you turn my son
into one of the Migos.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.694
BOTH:
Nailed it!

06:34.761 --> 06:35.962
(chuckles)

06:36.028 --> 06:37.997
(whooping)

06:38.064 --> 06:40.466
(laughs)

06:40.533 --> 06:43.102
Gemma got your boy nice.
No cap, Tina.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.074
You call me Tina again,
I'm-a cap that ass.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.475
I'm sorry, Mama.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.475
Yeah.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.647
Since we can't outrun him,
we got to outthink him.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.516
All right?
Give me your sunglasses,

06:56.582 --> 06:57.850
your phone and your wallet.

06:58.818 --> 07:00.119
(quietly):
Okay, come on.

07:10.730 --> 07:11.898
All right.

07:11.964 --> 07:12.965
There.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.001
The crackhead trap is set.

07:16.736 --> 07:18.070
Okay, here he comes,
here he comes.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.205
Hide, hide.

07:33.085 --> 07:34.520
Gotcha.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.156
All right,
let me out of here, man.

07:37.223 --> 07:38.524
All right,
look, Victor,

07:38.591 --> 07:39.892
all we want to do
is talk, man.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.762
Okay, come on, Victor.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.030
I can always get another lamp.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.168
No, no, no! No!

07:49.235 --> 07:50.903
Not my Ed Sheeran
autographed ukulele.

07:51.938 --> 07:53.573
Victor, listen to me, man.

07:53.639 --> 07:54.640
You better get off that table.

07:54.707 --> 07:55.608
You can't tell me what to do!

07:55.675 --> 07:56.676
I'm a grown man!

07:56.742 --> 07:58.177
What's going on?

07:58.244 --> 08:00.179
Why is Victor on my table?

08:00.246 --> 08:03.049
Boy, if you don't get down...

08:03.115 --> 08:06.152
I'm gonna give you everything
your butt signed up for.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.887
Yes, ma'am.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.658
I'm talking about everything
your butt signed up for.

08:18.831 --> 08:20.032
Man, when are they
gonna get here?

08:20.099 --> 08:21.868
I'm ready to get
this intervention on.

08:21.934 --> 08:24.837
Trey, why are you so excited
about Victor's intervention?

08:24.904 --> 08:27.139
Because for the first time,
I'm on the other side, player.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.908
(chuckling):
Oh, yerp.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.943
What up, yo?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.112
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Sorry, man.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.680
The barbershop is closed.

08:34.747 --> 08:37.183
Malcolm, it's me, Marty.

08:37.250 --> 08:39.719
I know it's you, Marty.

08:39.785 --> 08:41.053
I'm pretending I don't know you.

08:41.120 --> 08:42.221
Man, go home and change!

08:42.288 --> 08:44.657
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't hate, man.

08:44.724 --> 08:48.127
I have the look of the Migos
with the attitude of Ice Cube.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.097
You look like a wide receiver
on draft day.

08:52.632 --> 08:53.799
What is this all about, Marty?

08:53.866 --> 08:55.234
Hey, man, just...

08:56.369 --> 08:57.870
(chuckles) Never mind.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.139
Marty?

09:01.140 --> 09:03.709
(scoffs)
Is that you?

09:03.776 --> 09:05.044
Yeah, fo sho, baby.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.712
(chuckles) Fo sho.

09:06.779 --> 09:08.648
But the streets call me Big Mar.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.982
(chuckles)

09:10.049 --> 09:12.084
This is a way different look

09:12.151 --> 09:13.886
than what you were sporting
earlier.

09:13.953 --> 09:16.188
Uh, yeah,
that-that's because

09:16.255 --> 09:17.757
you caught me
in my court outfit.

09:17.823 --> 09:19.091
You see...

09:19.158 --> 09:20.092
(Jamaican accent):
a bad man got caught

09:20.159 --> 09:22.061
for doing bad men things.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.796
(laughing)

09:23.863 --> 09:26.832
It's like watching Al Roker
try to Crip Walk.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.734
Yeah, you need to get
with a real G like me,

09:28.801 --> 09:30.636
because I move in silence.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.639
Like the "G"
in "lasagna."

09:33.706 --> 09:37.310
So, can a bad man
walk a girl home?

09:37.376 --> 09:39.845
(chuckles):
Fo sho.

09:39.912 --> 09:42.949
Like the song says,
"Today was a good day."

09:43.015 --> 09:45.051
♪ ♪

09:47.320 --> 09:49.055
Where is it?

09:49.121 --> 09:50.990
Well, Victor, I lied to you.

09:51.057 --> 09:53.125
There is no cotton candy.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.193
I knew it.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.962
Okay, come on, man.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.631
Look, I had to get you
to your intervention somehow.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.834
Victor, we know what
you've been through.

10:01.901 --> 10:05.972
This is a chance for you to
tell all of us how you feel.

10:06.038 --> 10:08.808
You don't care how I feel.

10:08.874 --> 10:10.943
When y'all look at me,
all you see is Crackhead Victor.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.945
You know what,
that's it, guys.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.881
First, we got to stop
calling him Crackhead Victor.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.917
All right?
Addiction is an illness.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.685
It's not who he is.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.955
Look, Vic.

10:23.022 --> 10:25.024
I know you feel like
no one understands you.

10:25.091 --> 10:28.427
That's exactly how I felt
when I came home from Iraq.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.863
Hold up,
you're a veteran, too?

10:30.930 --> 10:32.198
Yeah.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.266
So I know firsthand
how hard it can be

10:34.333 --> 10:35.901
to adjust to civilian life.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.037
Look, PTSD, it affects
all of us differently,

10:38.104 --> 10:40.940
but you got to know,
you're not alone.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.275
Nobody asked anyone
to worry about me.

10:43.342 --> 10:46.345
Yet here we all are.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.749
Dave, tell him the plan.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.717
All right, well,
look, it wasn't easy.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.420
I made a ton of calls,
and all the rehab beds

10:54.487 --> 10:56.789
were taken in the neighboring
VA hospitals.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.692
But I was able
to find you a bed

10:59.759 --> 11:01.861
an hour away
in Loma Linda,

11:01.927 --> 11:04.263
if... if you're ready.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.200
Look, man, we've all been
working really hard

11:08.267 --> 11:10.136
to get you back
to the old Victor.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.840
Newsflash, Calvin.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.009
The old Victor's gone.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.078
I left him
back in Afghanistan.

11:19.145 --> 11:22.081
I came back to nothing
but pain.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.749
My parents died.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.985
I lost my friends.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.421
I lost myself.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.791
The only thing that can help me
with that pain:

11:31.857 --> 11:33.225
drugs.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.996
Hey, Victor, look,
all my pops is trying to say...

11:37.063 --> 11:38.864
I know what he's trying to say.

11:38.931 --> 11:41.100
But I ain't trying to hear it
right now.

11:41.167 --> 11:43.169
Victor, I swear, if you
walk out that door,

11:43.235 --> 11:44.470
I'm done with you.

11:48.407 --> 11:50.476
Victor.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.311
Come on.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.287
(gunfire on TV)

12:03.289 --> 12:05.524
Ooh...

12:05.591 --> 12:07.460
That movie went hard, right?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.462
(chuckles forcefully)
Yeah. Yeah.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.130
You know, I give it
two guns up.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.165
Pow, pow. (laughs)

12:15.301 --> 12:17.470
You know,
when we were younger,

12:17.536 --> 12:19.438
I always thought you were cute.

12:19.505 --> 12:22.842
Just a little too nice and soft,
if you know what I mean.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.844
Oh, yeah. I hear you.
I hear you.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.247
But, you know, maybe
sometimes being nice and soft

12:28.314 --> 12:29.982
isn't so bad.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.517
Maybe.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.853
But I like roughnecks
like you.

12:33.919 --> 12:35.421
(chuckles):
Oh... Yeah, yeah.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.756
(giggling):
That tickles.

12:39.225 --> 12:41.227
Tell me, Big Mar.

12:41.293 --> 12:44.296
What's the baddest thing
you've ever done?

12:44.363 --> 12:46.465
Oh, uh...

12:46.532 --> 12:48.534
(chuckles, scoffs)

12:48.601 --> 12:50.035
Hmm...

12:50.102 --> 12:52.104
I mean...

12:52.171 --> 12:54.373
One time,

12:54.440 --> 12:57.243
I took spare change and threw it
in a sacred well.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.013
Oh. "Spare Change" is
a rapper's name, right?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.982
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.117
Uh, yeah, yeah, let me
straighten it out for you, baby.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.853
Okay. So, Lil Spare Change was
a wannabe rapper.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.056
I took him and DJ Dollar Bill
and threw them in that well.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.526
(chuckles) You feel me?

13:13.592 --> 13:16.362
I feel you, Big Mar.

13:13.592 --> 13:16.362
Ooh.

13:16.428 --> 13:18.531
I feel you.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.266
(chuckles)

13:20.332 --> 13:21.467
Errbody do, baby.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.468
(chuckles)

13:22.535 --> 13:24.336
Errbody.

13:27.339 --> 13:29.608
Hey, hey,
what you ladies up to?

13:29.675 --> 13:33.145
Oh, just looking through old
photos of the neighborhood.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.615
You know, people,
places, Victor.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.417
Oh, no.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.419
Look, I've done
everything I can.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.888
Even Dave tried.
You-you were there.

13:42.955 --> 13:44.924
He almost lost his baby guitar.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.394
I hear what you're saying,
but, aw...

13:48.460 --> 13:51.530
look at this old picture
of Victor and Calvin.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.533
Aw, Victor looks
so good there.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.533
(laughs)

13:54.600 --> 13:55.935
Ah.

13:54.600 --> 13:55.935
Aw.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.303
You remember that day?

13:57.369 --> 13:58.871
(scoffs)

13:58.938 --> 14:01.006
Yeah. Of course.

14:01.073 --> 14:02.408
This was Victor's senior prom.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.176
He didn't have money
for a limo,

14:04.243 --> 14:08.347
so I rented a tux and
chauffeured him and his date.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.082
That's so sweet of you.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.318
Yeah. After that,
Victor signed up for the Army.

14:13.285 --> 14:14.620
You were so proud of him.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.156
Yeah.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.357
I was.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.092
(car alarm blaring)

14:20.159 --> 14:21.627
Ooh,
let me get my bat.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.195
Oh, it's just Victor.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.232
Oh, well, shouldn't
you turn your alarm off?

14:26.298 --> 14:27.566
No, he's got the code.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.335
He'll leave once
his sinuses clear up.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.971
(car alarm stops)

14:32.037 --> 14:33.505
Okay, I, um...

14:33.572 --> 14:35.174
I need you to do me
a favor, baby.

14:35.241 --> 14:36.408
I need you to take these
to Victor.

14:36.475 --> 14:38.344
Oh, no. Come on, Tina.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.045
No, no.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.614
I've done all I could do
for this guy.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.515
I'm not going back out there.
Forget about it.

14:43.582 --> 14:45.217
Come on, baby. If you do it,

14:45.284 --> 14:47.486
I'll act like it's your birthday
tonight.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.660
O-Okay.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.496
But I still get
my real birthday, too, right?

14:57.563 --> 14:59.665
Oh, most definitely.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.502
Victor.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.205
Come on, man. Open up.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.107
(sniffs)
Mmm.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.409
Pine. That does smell nice.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.346
Look, Tina wanted me
to give you this.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.681
I'm out.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.017
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.685
What's-what's this?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.987
I don't know.
Tina must've put it in your bag.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.590
Yeah, I remember this.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.091
My dad's lawn mower
had broken down,

15:26.158 --> 15:27.426
and instead of taking it
to the repair shop,

15:27.493 --> 15:28.694
you taught me how to fix it.

15:29.695 --> 15:32.364
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.566
And you used that lawn mower
to start cutting grass

15:34.633 --> 15:36.468
in the neighborhood
and make yourself some money.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.437
Bought your first
pair of Jordans.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.039
Sure did.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.007
Only for them to be stolen
by a crackhead.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.043
The irony.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.043
Hmm.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.645
Yeah.

15:49.281 --> 15:52.518
I didn't ask to be this way,
Calvin.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.087
Not everyone wins at life.

15:55.154 --> 15:57.523
Look, Victor.

15:57.589 --> 16:00.459
Everybody has
a story to tell, man.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.162
And luckily for me,
I've been a part of yours.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.631
I remember when you were
that scrawny little kid

16:05.698 --> 16:07.566
who just moved
into this neighborhood.

16:08.567 --> 16:10.436
I remember taking you
to get ice cream

16:10.502 --> 16:13.105
when you got straight A's
in middle school.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.374
Or hiding you from your mama
when you threw that boomerang

16:15.441 --> 16:17.443
through her picture window.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.443
(laughs)

16:17.509 --> 16:20.012
Tore my butt up twice
when she found me, too.

16:20.079 --> 16:22.147
(both chuckle)

16:24.216 --> 16:26.151
I miss you, Mama.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.523
Look, man.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.393
I don't care about
all the stuff you've done.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.495
All right, I know you.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.530
The real you.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.132
And, uh...

16:42.067 --> 16:43.369
Well, I love you too much

16:43.435 --> 16:45.804
for this to be
how your story ends.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.606
But...

16:47.673 --> 16:49.041
that's not up to me.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.045
It's your story.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.485
Tonight was on point,
Big Mar.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.053
Oh, yeah, you know,

17:01.120 --> 17:02.421
the best part of the night
for me was...

17:04.189 --> 17:05.691
That part.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.294
Mmm, cherry.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.294
(chuckles)

17:09.361 --> 17:11.163
Good night, Big Mar.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.099
Uh, yeah, good, uh,
good night, Kiki.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.770
(exhales sharply)

17:17.836 --> 17:20.072
(whooping)

17:23.342 --> 17:25.711
(chuckling)

17:25.778 --> 17:28.547
So, how was your date,
Nice Cube?

17:30.682 --> 17:32.384
Man, it was exhausting.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.455
I had no idea
it was so hard being so hard.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.526
All right,
check this, little bro.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.394
I know that Keisha has been

17:42.461 --> 17:44.763
your most wanted
since we were kids...

17:42.461 --> 17:44.763
Yeah.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.432
But, Marty,
you don't want a woman

17:46.498 --> 17:47.800
who doesn't dig you for you.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.536
(groans) You're right.

17:50.602 --> 17:53.539
And-and I-I plan on
coming clean to Keisha,

17:53.605 --> 17:55.741
once we're married and have
our twins, Luke and Leia.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.211
Look, man,
you are my little brother,

17:59.278 --> 18:01.613
and I don't just love you,
I like you.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.383
And I would hope that
any woman you end up with

18:04.450 --> 18:06.685
would love you
and like you, too.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.388
(sighs) All right, man.

18:09.455 --> 18:11.190
(grunts)

18:11.256 --> 18:12.558
God,

18:12.624 --> 18:15.561
if Keisha is for me,
give me a sign.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.129
(knocking)

18:19.765 --> 18:21.333
(chuckles)

18:21.400 --> 18:22.668
The Lord has spoken.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.338
Hey, I just got invited
to a release party,

18:26.405 --> 18:28.874
and there's only one bad boy
I want by my side.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.376
Oh, hell yeah, girl,
I love album release parties.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.479
(chuckles)

18:31.443 --> 18:33.479
You're so funny.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.147
It's not an album release party.

18:35.214 --> 18:36.482
This is a prison release party.

18:36.548 --> 18:37.783
What?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.485
Lil Murder Junior just got out.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.620
But his name is
Lil Murder Junior!

18:41.687 --> 18:43.422
Technicality.

18:44.490 --> 18:45.724
It's okay if I go freshen up?

18:46.925 --> 18:48.293
What?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.395
(singsongy):
Technicality.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.336
Morning, Calvin.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.838
You want some help getting him
off your porch?

18:59.905 --> 19:03.375
Nah.
Just let him sleep it off.

19:05.377 --> 19:07.646
Okay, I'm ready.

19:07.713 --> 19:09.214
Ready for what?

19:09.281 --> 19:10.415
I'm ready to get help.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.385
Uh...

19:13.452 --> 19:14.953
Did I hear what I thought
I just heard?

19:15.020 --> 19:16.655
Yeah, Dave.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.291
My man Victor here said
he's ready to get help.

19:19.358 --> 19:22.194
Our man is ready to get help.

19:22.261 --> 19:24.463
BOTH:
Our man is ready to get help!

19:22.261 --> 19:24.463
Guys!

19:24.530 --> 19:25.797
This ain't helping.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.867
Hold on.
Let me grab my keys.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.836
Be right back.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.836
All right, well, come on.
Hurry up.

19:32.971 --> 19:34.740
Hey, hey, hey. Ain't you gonna
get dressed first?

19:34.806 --> 19:36.708
You can't waste time
when a man is ready.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.711
Victor, you are in good hands
with me and Calvin.

19:39.778 --> 19:40.879
We got you.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.282
(engine starts)

19:44.783 --> 19:46.485
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.620
Yeah, all right.
Well, back it up.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.661
Okay, now we got you.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.463
It's true. And then,

19:58.530 --> 19:59.965
at the party,
guns start going off,

20:00.032 --> 20:02.234
so I hit the ground,
and Keisha says,

20:02.301 --> 20:03.702
"Real men don't duck."

20:03.769 --> 20:05.938
(laughter)

20:06.004 --> 20:07.773
Well, sounds like
it's bye-bye, thug life,

20:07.839 --> 20:09.841
and hello,
Star Trek marathon.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.010
(chuckles):
Man, hey, that's right, baby.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.913
The geek is back.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.913
(chuckling)

20:14.980 --> 20:16.915
Well, we knew that when
you walked in in that sweater.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.216
(laughter)

20:22.721 --> 20:24.289
Hon, you don't have
to jump a car.

20:24.356 --> 20:25.557
No man living off of crack
and Now and Laters

20:25.624 --> 20:27.359
is gonna outdo me.

20:27.426 --> 20:28.760
You know what, she's right,
man.
Yeah.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.529
Don't do it.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.529
Eh?

20:30.596 --> 20:31.663
Until I get my camera ready.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.664
Baby!

20:31.730 --> 20:32.664
Calvin!

20:32.731 --> 20:33.865
No, this is
gonna be good.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.367
Oh, my gosh.

20:33.932 --> 20:35.367
(groans)

20:33.932 --> 20:35.367
All right.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.336
Okay.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.336
Go! Yeah. Yeah.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.336
Oh, baby.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.704
Yeah. WorldStar!

20:39.504 --> 20:40.806
(groans)

20:44.476 --> 20:47.312
Aw, man.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.281
I didn't press record.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.549
You gonna have to do it again.
