00:18.120 --> 00:19.792
- Hey, Alan?
- Yeah?

00:20.840 --> 00:23.274
You had the "just say no" talk
with Jake, right?

00:24.800 --> 00:28.713
Of course. Why?
What talk did you have with him?

00:29.600 --> 00:31.591
No talk, it's just that he's...

00:31.760 --> 00:34.274
It'll be more fun if you see it.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.556
I'm guessing you don't mean
fun for me.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.110
Tell the truth.
How proud do you feel at this moment?

00:49.200 --> 00:50.428
What the hell is he doing?

00:52.080 --> 00:56.312
I don't know. Ten bucks says he hits the
ceiling if we turn on the garbage disposal.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.877
- Jake, what are you doing?
- Breathing.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.077
Breathing. Any particular reason
you're doing that in the sink?

01:05.239 --> 01:06.832
I have to practice.

01:07.480 --> 01:10.438
Man, the girls are gonna love him
when he grows up.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.599
- Jake?
- Yes?

01:15.960 --> 01:18.428
- I'll bring him up.
- Yeah.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.794
Hey, that's not funny.
I could have drowned.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.589
And then we'd have found your body
days later, washed up on the dish rack.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.192
- Where did you get all this snorkel stuff?
- Greg bought it for me.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.157
- Greg?
- Yeah, you know, Dr. Melnick...

01:35.320 --> 01:37.470
...Mom's boyfriend.
He's a real cool guy.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.632
He's gonna teach me how to scuba-dive
after I learn to snorkel.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.030
We're gonna need a bigger sink.

01:44.400 --> 01:48.313
He's got a gigantic boat with bedrooms
on it, and scuba tanks and wet suits.

01:48.480 --> 01:52.792
We're gonna go diving off Catalina. Wait
till you see the flippers he bought me.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.155
Well, Judith's boyfriend
sounds like quite a guy.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.312
- Yeah.
- You okay with that?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.879
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.315
This can be a sensitive area
for divorced guys.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.153
- I know.
- Ex-wife sleeping with another man.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.232
- Son starting to bond with him.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.597
- Big boat.
- Charlie, what's your freaking point here?

02:13.560 --> 02:16.233
No point. Just drilling for the nerve.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.670
So, what do you think? You wanna go
bowling today? Maybe catch a movie?

02:49.840 --> 02:52.274
No, I'm gonna take another bath.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.556
He does know there's an ocean
out there, right?

03:03.120 --> 03:05.998
Well, Greg doesn't want him
in the ocean.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.230
He wants him to spend time
training in a pool.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.834
In fact, my son's a little unhappy
about being here...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.231
...because he wanted to go snorkeling
in Greg's pool.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.711
He's got a boat and a pool?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.718
I guess you can afford
cool stuff...

03:19.880 --> 03:23.759
...when you don't have to sell your blood
and sperm to make alimony payments.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.469
Hey, hey, my relationship with my son
is not based on having cool stuff.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.119
And lucky for you.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.033
- Come on, look at the bright side.
- What bright side, Charlie?

03:33.200 --> 03:34.474
Delineate the bright side.

03:34.640 --> 03:38.599
Maybe one weekend Greg will let us
take a couple of chicks out on the boat.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.596
Why on earth
would he lend us his boat?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.556
He's tight with Jake,
we're tight with Jake. We've got an in.

03:45.720 --> 03:49.315
Are you not hearing my pain? My son
likes Judith's boyfriend better than me.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.597
Hey, I don't even know him
and I like him better than you.

03:53.560 --> 03:54.959
You'd think I'd learn.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.955
Alan. Alan, your son loves you.
You're a big influence on him.

04:00.120 --> 04:03.476
- You are the most important role model.
- Oh, I guess.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.313
I mean, so what if you can't teach him
to scuba-dive.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.550
For that matter,
you can't teach him to ski...

04:08.720 --> 04:11.837
...or hit a curve ball
or anything cool, really.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.155
But you bring plenty of other things
to the table.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.233
Thank you, God.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.712
- Hello, Charlie.
- Always a price, isn't there?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.753
- Hello, Alan.
- Jake's taking a bath.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.276
As much as I'd love to spend time
with my grandson, I'm in a hurry.

04:36.440 --> 04:37.793
Need to borrow your Mercedes.

04:37.960 --> 04:41.669
Well, since you're in a hurry,
I'll give you a quick answer. No.

04:41.840 --> 04:44.274
Charlie, please.
I'm showing a house in half an hour.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.000
What's wrong with that
little electric car you bought?

04:47.160 --> 04:51.073
Nothing, it's fine. It's what anybody
who cares about this planet is driving.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.038
If you're trying to sell real estate
to a Saudi oil prince...

04:54.200 --> 04:58.159
...you can't be driving up in some little
toy car with a plug in the bumper.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.112
You could use my car, Mom.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.230
You see? Now, that is how a loving son
treats his mother.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.278
Thank you, sweetheart,
but I need to look successful.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.239
- Charlie, your Mercedes.
- No, forget it.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.159
- Charlie, I am not leaving until you give...
- Happy motoring.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.958
Thank you.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.515
My car is in your driveway.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.829
And if you lose power,
there's a kite and a key in the trunk.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.996
For the record, there are other ways
of measuring success besides cars.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.072
You're right. There's boats and pools.

05:44.120 --> 05:47.908
You know what? I hope Mom puts a dent
in your big, shiny, new Mercedes.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.513
Hey, don't say that.

05:49.680 --> 05:53.275
If you're gonna hope for something,
hope she drives it off a cliff.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.713
So this is pretty cool, huh, Jake?
An electric car.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.269
I guess. What happens
when the batteries run out?

06:04.440 --> 06:06.908
You plug it in and recharge it.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.072
But what if there's a blackout?

06:09.720 --> 06:11.597
You sit in the back seat
with a pistol...

06:11.760 --> 06:14.228
...and wait for the looters,
just like any other car.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.269
- Charlie.
- It's a cool car, Jake.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.398
Greg has a really cool car.
He has a Hummer.

06:22.560 --> 06:25.472
You know, your Uncle Charlie's
no stranger to Hummers.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.232
Charlie.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.435
That's a cool car too, Jake.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.399
So, Jake, this is pretty cool, huh?

06:34.560 --> 06:37.518
Driving in a futuristic car,
going to see a movie.

06:40.560 --> 06:43.597
Hey, maybe afterwards
we can go get some pizza.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.239
Sure.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.315
And then, who knows, maybe...
Maybe your old dad will buy you...

06:52.480 --> 06:55.677
...an excessively violent and bloody
video game. How's that sound?

06:55.840 --> 06:57.398
Okay.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.152
You know,
when we go scuba diving...

06:59.320 --> 07:02.073
...Greg's gonna teach me
how to steer his boat.

07:02.240 --> 07:05.232
Well, I am sorry, Jake,
but, you know, I don't have a boat.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.188
I don't have a Hummer, and
I don't know how to scuba-dive.

07:09.360 --> 07:12.033
It's okay, Dad. Greg does.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.231
Hey, Jake, how'd you like your dad
to teach you how to drive a car?

07:18.400 --> 07:19.799
- What?
- Really?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.234
Charlie, he's 11.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.152
So? We'll find an empty parking lot.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.359
- What if he hits something?
- Alan, it's Mom's car.

07:28.760 --> 07:31.194
Guess what? Daddy's gonna teach you
how to drive.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.952
Cool.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.114
Can you reach the pedals?

07:38.280 --> 07:40.953
- Yeah. Can we turn on the radio?
- Forget the radio.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.119
Which one's the window squirter?

07:43.280 --> 07:45.430
Okay, forget the squirter.
Now, come on, focus.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.388
This is your rear-view mirror. It's very
important to check it before you back up.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.120
- Okay.
- Now... Well, what do you see?

07:52.280 --> 07:55.317
The top of Uncle Charlie's head.

07:55.480 --> 07:59.712
A shopping cart, a tree, soda can.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.235
- Looks like Mountain Dew.
- Okay.

08:02.400 --> 08:05.597
Forget the rear-view mirror. We're just...
We're just gonna go forward.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.593
Now, you know, this is the brake
and this is the gas.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.637
Thought it was electric.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.909
He's got you there, Alan.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.997
Okay, this is the brake
and this is the electric.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.118
They're very, very sensitive.
You don't have to press hard.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.315
Okay.

08:25.480 --> 08:26.833
Now, give it a little tap.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.036
- It is on?
- No.

08:29.960 --> 08:32.190
- Brake! Brake! Brake!
- Brake! Brake! Brake!

08:34.960 --> 08:38.475
Okay. Apparently it is on.

08:38.960 --> 08:42.111
- This is awesome.
- You see how careful you have to be?

08:42.280 --> 08:45.113
And how much closer we are
to the Dumpsters?

08:45.280 --> 08:46.918
- Can I squirt the windows now?
- No.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.197
Now... Okay, why don't you turn
the wheel slightly to the left...

08:50.360 --> 08:53.397
...and very gently press down on...

08:56.320 --> 08:58.311
Brake! Brake! Brake!

08:59.920 --> 09:02.275
Remember, if you wanna drive
Grandma's car again...

09:02.440 --> 09:04.556
...you can't be telling her about it.
- I know.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.156
Or Mom, or anybody else.
Daddy doesn't need the grief.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.197
That was really cool, Dad. Thanks.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.631
- Yeah. Yeah, it was.
- Hey, it just occurred to me.

09:14.800 --> 09:18.315
If Greg's here, we can ask him
about going out on the boat.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.948
No, I'm not going to ask Greg
about going...

09:21.120 --> 09:23.190
Hi, Judith.
Here he is, safe and sound.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.036
- Hey, honey.
- Hey, Mom. Guess what we just did.

09:26.200 --> 09:27.713
- What?
- Nothing in particular.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.990
That's a kids' joke.
"Nothing in particular."

09:34.160 --> 09:36.355
He's been doing it to us all weekend.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.718
- So, well, okay. Bye.
- Alan.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.472
Alan.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.068
Ask about the boat.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.956
- Listen, next weekend...
- Yeah, yeah.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.509
I know. You and Greg
are taking Jake scuba diving.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.432
No, that's the thing.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.670
Greg and I have decided
not to see each other.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.071
So if you haven't made any plans,
you can have Jake.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.708
Oh, yeah, yeah. I'd love to have him.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.156
And I'm sorry to hear
about you and Greg.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.876
- Thank you.
- Is there anything I can do?

10:16.480 --> 10:18.914
Yeah, you can wipe that smirk
off your face.

10:19.600 --> 10:23.195
- Okay. Well... Well, bye.
- Bye.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.475
<i>She broke up with Greg</i>
<i>She broke up with Greg</i>

10:27.640 --> 10:29.437
<i>She broke up with Greg</i>

10:29.600 --> 10:30.953
- Alan?
- Yeah?

10:31.120 --> 10:32.439
Peephole.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.351
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

10:47.920 --> 10:52.072
Car wash. They found something
real interesting in the back seat.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.430
Oh, yeah, what?

10:57.400 --> 10:58.992
Okay, now you're just showing off.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.434
No, Alan, I'm not.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.791
Although I have to admit,
that is a sexy little item.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.155
- It is, isn't it?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.356
I'd like to meet the lady who fills this.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.837
Actually, you know her.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.151
- Oh, really? Lisa?
- No.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.153
- Jennifer?
- Who's Jennifer?

11:18.320 --> 11:20.470
Oh, right. No.

11:20.640 --> 11:21.993
Well, then who?

11:22.160 --> 11:26.676
I can tell you, but once I do,
I can't untell you.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.276
- What are you talking about?
- Who borrowed my car last weekend?

11:32.320 --> 11:34.550
Holy mother of God.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.559
No. No. Unholy mother of us.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.474
Mom in a car?

11:42.640 --> 11:45.154
Mom in my car.

11:45.320 --> 11:49.233
If I'd known this was gonna happen,
I'd have gotten the vinyl seats.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.836
Wait. You're not just gonna leave it
in the middle of the floor, are you?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.718
Really creeps you out, doesn't it?

11:55.880 --> 11:58.394
- No.
- Then pick it up.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.988
Hello? Oh, oh, hi, Jake. What's up?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.558
Slow down there.

12:20.720 --> 12:24.190
Yeah. No, I know your mom
broke up with Greg.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.591
Yes. I understand
that you're very upset, but...

12:28.200 --> 12:29.872
Well, no, no.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.749
I can't come over there and pick you up
just because you're mad at your mother.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.994
Well... I'm sorry, that's just the way it is.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.833
Now, why don't you let me
speak to her.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.390
Yeah, Judith, hi.
Look, I am trying to back you up here.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.711
No, I told him he had to work it out
with you.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.636
No, no... Really?

12:54.800 --> 12:57.633
You think it would be better
if he came over here to cool off?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.313
Okay, but...

13:00.480 --> 13:02.550
Well, bring him over, then.

13:03.520 --> 13:05.954
Well... No, I'll see you in a bit.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.792
- Jake's coming over?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:07.960 --> 13:10.838
Apparently he's furious with his mother
about this Greg thing.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.515
Well, that's understandable. He was just
getting to know this amazing guy...

13:14.680 --> 13:17.274
...who had a boat and a pool
and a Hummer.

13:18.040 --> 13:21.077
A guy who could teach him
all sorts of cool stuff.

13:21.240 --> 13:25.472
And then his mother just rips
this wonderful man out of his life.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.268
Too soon?

13:30.080 --> 13:32.071
Hello. Everybody decent?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.636
Oh, hi, Mom. What a surprise.

13:36.320 --> 13:39.198
Well, I was in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by...

13:39.360 --> 13:41.715
...and see how my sons
are getting along.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.589
- Well, we're doing fine.
- Yep, just fine.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.356
- Good. Jake?
- He's... He's fine.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.954
Just dandy.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.749
Oh, the hell with it.

14:00.360 --> 14:05.275
I left a $300 bra in the back seat
of your Mercedes, and I want it back.

14:05.440 --> 14:10.798
Oh, my. How in heaven's name
did that happen, Mother?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.714
- Well, if you must know...
- I don't need to know.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.676
Oh, Alan, grow up.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.879
I sold a 12-million-dollar house
and I wanted to celebrate.

14:22.040 --> 14:23.871
With the Saudi prince?

14:24.680 --> 14:29.310
Don't be ridiculous. He's got nine wives
and they're all like 11 years old.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.710
No, I was with the seller's realtor.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.314
Splitting that juicy commission
made us both so hot...

14:34.480 --> 14:37.074
...we barely made it
off the front lawn.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.158
Now, go get Mommy's bra.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.710
Oh, darling, that is just sick.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.636
Seek help.

15:10.360 --> 15:11.588
Hey.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.558
- Hey, what's going on?
- My mom broke up with Greg.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.994
I heard.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.469
I'm gonna live here with you and Dad
from now on.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.232
Wanna bet?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.876
- Why not?
- Two reasons:

15:23.040 --> 15:25.270
Your mother loves you,
and life is cruel.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.913
Wait, that may just be one reason.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.670
Well, maybe my dad can talk my mom
into getting back together with Greg.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.917
Enjoy fifth grade, kid. You're obviously
gonna be there for a while.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.718
What am I supposed to do, Alan?

15:40.920 --> 15:42.592
I know how much he liked Greg...

15:42.760 --> 15:45.399
...but that can't be the reason
for me to keep seeing him.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.312
I understand. You're not wrong here.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.710
I'm not? Because I certainly feel wrong.

15:49.880 --> 15:52.713
I failed as a wife.
I'm failing as a mother.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.440
I even blew it as a lesbian.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.431
That might have been the problem.

15:59.560 --> 16:03.872
You're not a failure. We're both at fault
for the marriage not working.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.715
You're a great mother. And I'm sure you
would have made a heck of a lesbian...

16:07.880 --> 16:09.916
...if you just hung in there
a little longer.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.830
I'm gonna take Jake out
so you guys can talk.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.274
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Charlie.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.910
- Where we going?
- I gotta trade in my car.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.799
Why are you trading this car in?
Didn't you just get it?

16:26.960 --> 16:30.236
Yeah, but there's a banging noise
that's driving me crazy.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.394
I don't hear anything.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.869
You're not in my head.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.834
Hey, as long as you're getting rid of it,
mind if I take it for a little spin?

16:43.440 --> 16:44.714
Get real.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.311
I promise I'll go really slow.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.755
Forget it. It's not gonna happen.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.753
Is that a footprint up there?

16:57.880 --> 17:01.190
I never should have brought Jake
into the relationship. It was too soon.

17:01.360 --> 17:02.759
Don't be too hard on yourself.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.230
So Greg didn't turn out to be the great
guy you thought he was gonna be.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.279
Oh, he was a great guy.
My God, Alan, he took my breath away.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.438
Our first night together he picked me up
and carried me to bed in his arms.

17:17.160 --> 17:20.675
Well, the point is you brought Jake
into the relationship too soon.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.874
Greg said I was too demanding.
I am, aren't I?

17:24.040 --> 17:26.348
- I am a demanding, angry shrew.
- Hey, hey.

17:26.520 --> 17:28.670
Don't say that. That...
That is not who you are.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.071
That's just who you've become.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.112
But, you know, underneath it all...

17:37.280 --> 17:39.635
...I can still see the frightened,
neurotic girl...

17:39.800 --> 17:43.634
...with the minor eating disorder
that I fell in love with.

17:46.120 --> 17:47.712
Oh, Alan.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.318
I don't get it.
This is exactly like your other car.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.155
No, it's not. Listen. No banging.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.832
Well, I think you should have gotten
a cool car like Greg.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.560
Hey, do yourself a favor
and stop worshiping this dude.

18:10.720 --> 18:13.314
There's a guy in your life
who's worth looking up to...

18:13.480 --> 18:14.959
...and modeling yourself after.

18:15.120 --> 18:18.476
- Dad?
- Okay, two guys.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.677
Well, I still don't understand
why my mom had to break up with Greg.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.469
It could have been worse. She could
have married him and then broken up.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.279
When I was your age,
I was already on my third stepfather.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.271
And I kind of liked the second one.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.194
Well, how did you feel?

18:33.360 --> 18:35.749
How do you think I felt?
I was pissed off.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.272
- Yeah, well, so am I.
- And I'm not saying you shouldn't be...

18:39.440 --> 18:42.750
...but you can't blame your mother.
She's gotta do what's right for her.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.592
- You understand?
- I guess.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.352
Good.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.875
The next time you see her,
give her a big hug...

18:49.040 --> 18:52.635
...and let her know that there's still
one guy who's willing to live with her.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.552
Okay.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.715
Wait, you blame your mom
for everything.

18:58.640 --> 19:01.518
That's different. My mom's Satan.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.752
Come on, let's go boat shopping.

19:33.080 --> 19:34.399
If I'm old enough to drive...

19:34.560 --> 19:36.949
...I'm old enough to know
what's going on with you and Mom.

19:37.120 --> 19:39.395
You're not old enough to drive.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.516
I don't believe that you were carrying
her because she twisted her ankle.

19:44.840 --> 19:48.037
Believe what you want.
That's my story and I'm sticking to it.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.028
Tell him, Charlie.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.194
Your parents were about to have sex
when we walked in.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.159
Yeah, right.
