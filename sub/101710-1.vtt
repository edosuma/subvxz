WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:05.255
How you doing over there?

00:02.877 --> 00:05.255
I'm good.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.090
Really good.

00:05.338 --> 00:07.090
Good.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.261
Is it weird that I'm good?

00:11.344 --> 00:13.263
No, it's good
that you're good.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.267
Good. Well, I'm good.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.269
Every mom dreams of the day
when they drop

00:19.352 --> 00:22.397
their 42-year-old daughter off
at the airport to go to school.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.444
And I did it all by myself.

00:27.527 --> 00:28.820
Hey, I'm here.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.948
Oh, not the dropping off,
the raising.

00:28.903 --> 00:31.948
Oh.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.742
I mean, I wasn't there
the whole time.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.493
But I was definitely there
for the beginning.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.122
In and out during the middle,
and rock-solid from age 37 on,

00:39.205 --> 00:41.207
you know, the formative years.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.917
You have a lot
to be proud of.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.295
Damn right.
Georgetown Law School

00:45.378 --> 00:47.672
on a full scholarship.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.300
Phew. Lot of parents would be
in a puddle of tears right now,

00:50.383 --> 00:51.968
but you know
what I think of them?

00:52.051 --> 00:54.137
Selfish.
(chuckles)

00:54.220 --> 00:56.306
Not me, 'cause I'm focusing
on what she's gonna get,

00:56.389 --> 00:58.016
not what I'm gonna lose.

01:00.018 --> 01:01.644
(voice breaking): Which is
the most beautiful little girl

01:01.728 --> 01:03.980
a mother could ever have.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.483
And this is why I drove.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.194
(crying): Oh, please.
You're gonna cry, too.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.653
Am not.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.531
The Father's Day card
she gave you last year?

01:13.615 --> 01:15.784
(crying):
Why would you do that to me?

01:15.867 --> 01:18.328
'Cause you miss her
as much as I do.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.205
I-I do!

01:20.288 --> 01:22.373
(both sobbing)

01:24.626 --> 01:26.294
You want to go back and
watch the plane take off?

01:26.377 --> 01:28.338
I do!

01:26.377 --> 01:28.338
Okay.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.383
♪ ♪

01:51.236 --> 01:53.404
Bonnie, alcoholic.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.404
ALL: Hi, Bonnie.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.491
Well, it's been a month since
Adam and I became empty-nesters,

01:56.574 --> 01:58.493
and we are loving it.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.412
We learn something new
about each other every day.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.540
And we learn a lot
about Christy, too.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.208
Apparently, she was the one
vacuuming the living room.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.334
(chuckles)

02:07.627 --> 02:09.546
And another thing
we learned about her,

02:09.629 --> 02:11.756
she doesn't understand
time zones.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.716
She's smart enough to get
a scholarship to law school,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.426
but she can't grasp
the fact that her 7:00 a.m.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.178
is my 4:00 a.m.

02:17.262 --> 02:20.348
She's constantly waking me up
'cause she can't subtract three.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.351
Well, my fault.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.563
I should've taken her
to kindergarten once in a while.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.106
Yeah, she's in law school.
She's fine.

02:28.189 --> 02:30.191
That's it. Thanks.

02:30.275 --> 02:32.235
(applause)

02:30.275 --> 02:32.235
Now that Christy's gone,

02:32.318 --> 02:33.528
would you like me
to roll my eyes

02:33.611 --> 02:35.280
a little bit more
while you share?

02:36.823 --> 02:39.075
Tammy?

02:36.823 --> 02:39.075
Tammy, alcoholic.

02:39.158 --> 02:40.285
ALL:
Hi, Tammy.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.953
Uh, it's my birthday tomorrow.

02:42.036 --> 02:43.913
Uh, not a sober one, a
squeezing out of the womb one.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.040
Normally,

02:46.124 --> 02:49.669
I love my birthday,
but not this year.

02:49.752 --> 02:53.381
My dad tracked me down
from prison and sent me a card

02:53.464 --> 02:55.008
saying he's gonna
call me tomorrow.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.428
What am I supposed to do
with that?

02:58.511 --> 03:01.139
The man killed my mom.

03:01.222 --> 03:03.641
I haven't talked to him
since I was 14.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.393
And I don't want
to talk to him now.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.106
I know this program
is about second chances,

03:10.189 --> 03:12.275
but does that mean
I have to give him one?

03:12.358 --> 03:14.444
I mean... I don't know.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.780
I'm totally spinning out
over what to do.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.365
Thanks.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.743
(applause)

03:21.826 --> 03:23.453
Well, now I feel bad
for sharing about

03:23.536 --> 03:25.330
how my Jacuzzi's
not bubbly enough.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.626
You know, there's a place
where you can get free hot wings

03:29.709 --> 03:31.377
on your birthday.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.377
Nice.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.171
Yeah, they give you
a free wing for every year.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.506
It's the only time
I'm honest about my age.

03:36.507 --> 03:39.969
Wow, it is a mess over here.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.139
I know. Christy really did a lot
more cleaning than we thought.

03:43.222 --> 03:44.933
Yeah, well,
I'll pick up the slack.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.476
Great. She used to
do the coffee urn.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.645
Oh, on it.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.480
(gasps) Oh, I think
we should throw this one away

03:50.563 --> 03:52.482
and start over.

03:52.565 --> 03:56.527
Girls, don't forget Tammy's
surprise dinner tomorrow.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.781
BOTH:
Get there by 7:00 and park
the car around the corner.

03:59.864 --> 04:02.492
Good. You're as
excited as I am.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.827
Brilliant idea:
I'm gonna throw Tammy

04:04.911 --> 04:06.996
a surprise slumber party
tomorrow night at my house.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.498
(gasps)
Love it.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.498
Sounds good.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.333
Bonnie, you know I've
been planning a dinner.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.334
But my idea's better.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.169
Kind of is.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.213
I've been working
on this for weeks.

04:15.296 --> 04:16.506
Well, I'm sorry, but she told me

04:16.589 --> 04:17.674
she really wanted
a slumber party.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.509
When did she say that?

04:20.259 --> 04:21.260
When she was 14.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.222
But I'm sure it's still true.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.185
Oh, damn it.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.645
What's up?

04:30.728 --> 04:33.481
I accidentally got
"It's a Girl!" balloons.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.857
Well, Tammy is a girl.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.196
I'm sorry, I know you don't like
me to look on the bright side.

04:40.279 --> 04:43.116
I really want to keep Tammy's
mind off her dad calling.

04:43.199 --> 04:46.202
This party has to be perfect,
and I messed up the decorations.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.037
Or you did that on purpose
so, when Jill gets here,

04:48.121 --> 04:50.790
she takes over
and does everything for you.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.209
Look, I didn't marry you
so you could get to know me.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.254
(knocking on door)

04:57.255 --> 05:00.174
Hey.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.884
Oh, hey, Adam,
are you staying

05:01.968 --> 05:05.179
for the ladies-only party
that's only for ladies?

05:05.263 --> 05:07.098
No, Gus and I are going fishing.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.725
That's code for
drinking beer in a cabin

05:08.808 --> 05:10.184
and not fishing at all.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.184
(chuckles)

05:10.268 --> 05:11.769
She's not wrong.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.769
Mwah.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.770
Have fun.

05:12.854 --> 05:13.730
Come on, Gus.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.941
He doesn't even own a rod.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.901
ADAM:
I'm gonna pick one up
at the liquor store!

05:20.028 --> 05:21.738
So...
(clears throat)

05:21.821 --> 05:23.740
Am I seeing your decorations
in their entirety?

05:23.823 --> 05:26.367
No. I got baby shower balloons.

05:27.326 --> 05:30.413
Mm-hmm, taking over.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.457
Mm-hmm, letting you.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.880
(knocking on door)

05:38.963 --> 05:40.214
What's this?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.758
It's the cake
you asked me to bring.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.551
But it's
from the grocery store.

05:43.634 --> 05:45.595
I thought you'd bake
something.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.097
And I thought we'd be
at a nice dinner right now.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.767
Guess we were both wrong.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.435
We don't just go to bed, right?

05:52.518 --> 05:53.770
Don't look at me.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.605
My gosh, did none of you ever go

05:55.688 --> 05:56.939
to a slumber party
when you were kids?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.316
Foster care.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.316
No friends.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.027
I was strung out on horse.

06:02.987 --> 06:04.739
Oh. Well, lucky for you,

06:04.822 --> 06:07.700
I was extremely popular
and I will guide you through it.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.786
There is an ebb and flow
to a slumber party,

06:09.869 --> 06:12.121
not unlike a poem
or a good massage.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.122
(knocking on door)

06:13.206 --> 06:14.832
She's here. Big smiles.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.542
Not the pageant one,
Jill, the real one.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.131
Hey. Remember what you wanted
for your 14th birthday?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.299
A case of beer?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.299
No.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.509
Curly hair? True love?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.509
No.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.302
No. A slumber party.
And here it is!

06:26.385 --> 06:28.304
ALL:
Surprise!

06:28.387 --> 06:30.598
Oh, my God, you guys.
This is amazing!

06:30.681 --> 06:32.475
Look at the flowers
and balloons.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.185
And a sign with
my name on it.

06:34.268 --> 06:37.230
Oh, there's no way this
could possibly be better.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.107
Unless we had a homemade cake.

06:43.194 --> 06:45.154
Never have I ever

06:45.238 --> 06:47.156
faked a toothache
just to get nitrous.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.658
Oh.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.658
(laughs)

06:48.741 --> 06:50.451
So, I drink if
I've done it?

06:50.535 --> 06:51.744
ALL:
Yes.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.496
We've been playing this game
for half an hour.

06:53.579 --> 06:55.498
How is this still
a question for you?

06:55.581 --> 06:58.042
The sentence structure
is very confusing.

06:58.126 --> 07:00.962
It should really just
be "have you ever."

07:01.045 --> 07:02.338
Well, normally,
you'd play this game drunk,

07:02.421 --> 07:03.548
so grammar doesn't matter.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.509
Okay, let me try one.

07:06.592 --> 07:09.178
I have never,
ever, never...

07:09.262 --> 07:11.305
Oy.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.305
(all groan)

07:11.389 --> 07:13.850
...had sex in a church.

07:11.389 --> 07:13.850
WENDY:
Mm.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.102
Wait, it was a bris.
Do synagogues count?

07:16.185 --> 07:18.479
How about an Amish guy
at a barn raising?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.439
Any place where God is defiled.

07:21.649 --> 07:23.401
Hey, didn't you have sex
at a funeral?

07:23.484 --> 07:25.486
I did,
but it was at the cemetery.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.572
Thanks for remembering, though.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.907
You go, Bonnie.

07:29.991 --> 07:33.327
Oh, good luck finding
something you haven't done.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.664
Never have I ever
eaten cat treats

07:36.747 --> 07:38.457
because I was curious.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.502
I knew it!

07:39.959 --> 07:41.502
(all laughing)

07:42.795 --> 07:43.880
Tammy, go.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.215
No, no, I want to go again.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.384
Never have I ever

07:48.467 --> 07:50.720
killed something I was
supposed to be taking care of.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.722
I forgot to water
your ficus. Get over it.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.725
All 73 of your cats
were still alive, weren't they?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.896
What'd you kill,
someone's buzz?

07:59.979 --> 08:01.731
No.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.191
A man.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.525
TAMMY, BONNIE AND MARJORIE:
What?

08:03.274 --> 08:04.525
Wait,

08:04.609 --> 08:06.235
did this just segue
into Murder Mystery?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.654
Because I did not
authorize that.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.199
Last week,
I had two patients in the ER

08:11.282 --> 08:13.034
and only one ICU bed.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.745
I advocated for one guy
over the other,

08:15.828 --> 08:17.705
so the doctor took him first.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.790
By the time we found a bed,

08:19.874 --> 08:21.751
the other patient had died.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.920
Oh, sweetie, that's
not your fault.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.755
You're a nurse. You
have to prioritize

08:25.838 --> 08:27.590
based on who needs it more.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.926
But I'm not sure I did.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.136
The other guy was rude to me.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.015
I'm worried
that I was playing God.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.895
No. You just have
a really tough job.

08:40.978 --> 08:43.231
You didn't kill
anybody. My dad,

08:43.314 --> 08:44.774
on the other hand...

08:43.314 --> 08:44.774
New game. New game, Jill.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.151
(clears throat) Yeah. Okay.
This one's my favorite.

08:47.235 --> 08:50.112
Tammy, you breathe really fast
until you get light-headed,

08:50.196 --> 08:52.281
and the rest of us will push
on your chest till you pass out.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.449
It's called Pass Out.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.660
As a medical
professional,

08:55.743 --> 08:57.620
I am not sure I
can allow this.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.081
As a sober person,
I don't think it's a good idea.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.458
Aw. I can't drink.
I can't do drugs.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.961
Now I can't even have people
cut off my air supply for fun?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.545

09:08.756 --> 09:13.052
All right, ladies,
welcome to Sex Bucket.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.136

09:14.220 --> 09:15.471
This contains the names

09:15.554 --> 09:17.139
of the men
from our Wednesday meeting.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.517
When it is your turn,
you will pick two names

09:19.600 --> 09:21.477
and choose the one
you would sleep with.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.477
BONNIE: Oh!

Ah.

Don't love the beard,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.006
TAMMY:
Hmm.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.006
Oh, I don't know.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.132
Just pick one.

09:51.215 --> 09:52.341
I prefer Tom,

09:52.425 --> 09:54.176
but there's a lot
of self-adjusting.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.178
This isn't real.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.722
That doesn't mean
it couldn't lead to something.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.974
Okay, part of what makes
this game fun is pace.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.350
Marjorie, go.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.019
I don't want to
play this game.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.979

want to be treated

10:05.062 --> 10:06.355
with respect and dignity,

10:06.439 --> 10:08.733
we shouldn't be sitting here
objectifying men.

objectifying the hot ones.

I'm with my friends, so I can't
really talk right now, but...

18:12.257 --> 18:15.886
(choked up): thank you
for remembering my birthday.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.471
Okay, bye.

18:19.973 --> 18:21.975
(laughs)

18:22.059 --> 18:23.894

18:29.399 --> 18:32.694
(groans) My back is gonna
hate me in the morning.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.239
My left ass cheek is
totally numb.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.699
We may be too old
to sleep on the floor.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.827
Why does Marjorie
get the couch?

18:39.910 --> 18:41.620
(quietly):
Because she's dying.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.834
I'm not dying and I'm not deaf.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.044
Although lately
I've been having trouble

18:49.127 --> 18:51.004
in noisy restaurants.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.841
Guys, it's
almost 4:00 a.m.

18:53.924 --> 18:55.634
We've got
to go to sleep.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.720
Jill's right. We're gonna be
so cranky in the morning.

18:58.804 --> 19:01.348
Thanks for the best
birthday ever, you guys.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.933
Good night.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.560
Good night.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.436
Good night.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.436
Night.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.436
Good night.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.773
(ringtone playing)

19:10.983 --> 19:12.609
Unbelievable.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.237
Hi, Christy.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.406
No. I'm up.

19:17.489 --> 19:18.574
How's it going, honey?
