WEBVTT

00:09.133 --> 00:11.200
SHAWN! SHAWN!
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.100
HOLD ON. I'M CHECKING
MY MESSAGES.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.000
HEY, JOHN, WHAT'S YOUR
SECRET CODE?

00:16.000 --> 00:17.300
OH. IT'S 1434.

00:17.300 --> 00:20.400
HEY, MATTHEWS,
HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY SECRET CODE?

00:20.400 --> 00:23.467
EASY. IT'S THE SAME
AS YOUR BANK CARD.

00:23.467 --> 00:27.600
OH. I OWE YOU
40 BUCKS.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.800
WELL, NO MESSAGES.
MY DAD HASN'T CALLED
IN TWO WEEKS.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.500
I WOULDN'T WORRY.
THERE'S A MILLION
GOOD REASONS.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.934
YEAH. UH...

00:33.934 --> 00:37.133
WASN'T HE VISITING
THE VATICAN TO SEE
HIS FRIEND THE POPE?

00:37.133 --> 00:38.000
YEAH.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.033
WELL, THEY ONLY HAVE
ONE PHONE

00:40.033 --> 00:41.900
AND IT'S IN THE POPE'S
BEDROOM,

00:41.900 --> 00:44.100
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO IN THERE.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.700
HE WROTE HE WAS HEADED
THIS WAY.

00:46.700 --> 00:49.600
I WAS HOPING TO SEE HIM,
THAT'S ALL.

00:49.600 --> 00:50.834
MR. TURNER,

00:50.834 --> 00:53.100
WE GOT A BIG PROBLEM
WITH SHAWN.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.133
THIS ONE GOES
WAY BEYOND POOBERTY.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
YOU MEAN, "PUBERTY."

00:59.200 --> 01:00.600
YEAH. POOBERTY.

01:00.600 --> 01:03.600
LISTEN, YOU GOT TO GET
SHAWN'S DAD OUT HERE,

01:03.600 --> 01:05.133
AT LEAST A VISIT.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.133
HE HASN'T SEEN HIM

01:06.133 --> 01:08.967
SINCE HE WENT AFTER
HIS MOM A YEAR AGO.

01:08.967 --> 01:11.500
I DON'T THINK
HE'LL RETURN SOON.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.200
WHY DO YOU
SAY THAT?

01:13.200 --> 01:17.200
A FEW MONTHS BACK
HE SENT ME THE PAPERWORK

01:17.200 --> 01:19.200
TO MAKE ME SHAWN'S
LEGAL GUARDIAN.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.500
NO WONDER SHAWN'S
BEEN BUMMED OUT.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.867
IT'S A BIG STEP FOR HIM
<i>AND </i>FOR ME.

01:23.867 --> 01:26.233
IT'S DIFFICULT ENOUGH
SHARING THAT APARTMENT.

01:26.233 --> 01:29.100
MR. TURNER, YOU GOT
TO DO SOMETHING.

01:29.100 --> 01:30.900
YEAH. I DO.

01:30.900 --> 01:33.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.200
HERE'S THE 30 BUCKS.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.200
40.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.500
THAT'S
A GOOD MEMORY.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.100
I DIDN'T LIKE ANY
OF THE APARTMENTS.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.500
BE SPECIFIC.

01:45.500 --> 01:48.600
O.K. THE FIRST ONE.
ABSOLUTELY NO FURNITURE.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.000
SHAWN, IT WAS
AN UNFURNISHED
APARTMENT.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.033
THANK YOU.

01:52.033 --> 01:53.900
WHY ARE YOU BEING
DIFFICULT?

01:53.900 --> 01:55.300
I'M NOT BEING
DIFFICULT.

01:55.300 --> 01:57.200
I DIDN'T MIND
THE NICE DUPLEX,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.400
BUT YOU SAID
IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.667
GOOD NEWS. THE DUPLEX
IN THE CONDO COMMUNITY?

02:02.667 --> 02:03.934
I TALKED HIM DOWN,

02:03.934 --> 02:06.467
AND LOOK WHAT
THEY'RE THROWING IN.

02:06.467 --> 02:07.600
CARPETS.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.233
MY ADVICE IS TO GO SHAG,

02:09.233 --> 02:12.000
BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD
BETWEEN YOUR TOES.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.867
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH RIGHT HERE?

02:14.867 --> 02:16.100
I MEAN, LOOK.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.567
THERE'S FURNITURE
EVERYWHERE.

02:17.567 --> 02:19.100
AND THE NEIGHBORS?
THE BEST.

02:19.100 --> 02:20.767
PEOPLE WHO MIND
THEIR OWN BUSINESS.

02:20.767 --> 02:24.500
MRS. DUPCHEK,
CAN YOU QUIT LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

02:24.500 --> 02:25.700
ELI, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:25.700 --> 02:27.300
REMEMBER WHEN
MRS. DUPCHEK'S
HUSBAND DIED,

02:27.300 --> 02:30.700
AND SHE SAID
SHE'D NEVER LOOK
AT ANOTHER MAN?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.734
WELL, SHE'S OVER HIM...

02:32.734 --> 02:35.500
AND I'M SCARED.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.000
WHY? YOU COULD DO WORSE.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.700
IN FACT, I'VE SEEN YOU

02:38.700 --> 02:40.000
DO WORSE
THAN MRS. DUPCHEK.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.767
THIS BUILDING'S GOING
TO MISS THAT WIT

02:42.767 --> 02:43.934
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

02:43.934 --> 02:45.200
WHEN IS THAT HAPPY DAY?

02:45.200 --> 02:47.400
SOON AS SHAWN FINDS
A PLACE HE LIKES.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.667
SINCE EVERYBODY'S
TALKING ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M NOT HERE,

02:50.667 --> 02:52.934
I MIGHT AS WELL
NOT BE HERE.

02:52.934 --> 02:55.400
LET ME KNOW
HOW THINGS TURN OUT.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.400
LOOK, I KNOW SHAWN'S
A LITTLE ANTSY
ABOUT THIS,

02:58.400 --> 03:01.900
BUT THIS IDEA OF MOVING
INTO A NEW APARTMENT?

03:01.900 --> 03:03.233
I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT.

03:03.233 --> 03:05.600
SHAWN, WAIT UP!
I GOT SOME LINOLEUMS

03:05.600 --> 03:08.033
THAT'LL KNOCK
YOUR SOCKS OFF!

03:11.934 --> 03:13.100
MR. MATTHEWS.

03:13.100 --> 03:14.567
HOW I LOVE THE ENERGY

03:14.567 --> 03:17.700
OF THE REDEDICATED
AND ENTHUSIASTIC SENIOR.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.400
OFF TO CLASS, EH?

03:19.400 --> 03:20.400
LUNCH.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.000
IT WOULDN'T BE
A BAD IDEA

03:22.000 --> 03:24.567
TAKING SOME OF THAT PEP
INTO THE CLASSROOM.

03:24.567 --> 03:27.934
WELL, YOU START
SERVING MASHED TATERS,
MAYBE I WILL.

03:27.934 --> 03:30.100
I'LL TAKE IT
UNDER CONSIDERATION.

03:30.100 --> 03:31.200
NOW, WHILE YOU'RE HERE,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.100
I HAVE YOUR PAPER
ON EUROPEAN MONARCHIES.

03:34.100 --> 03:35.100
A "D".

03:35.100 --> 03:36.200
YES.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.000
I WORKED HARD ON THIS.
WHERE DID I GO WRONG?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.500
I'D HAVE TO SAY
THE FIFTH GRADE,

03:41.500 --> 03:43.500
WHEN YOU RODE
IN THE DRYER.

03:43.500 --> 03:45.934
YEAH, BUT IF IT
WASN'T FOR THAT

03:45.934 --> 03:48.400
MY HAIR WOULD STILL
LOOK LIKE CORY'S.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.300
YOU KNOW HOW HARD
I'VE BEEN WORKING
LATELY.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.934
THIS WILL KILL
MY AVERAGE.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.500
CAN I DO ANOTHER PAPER?

03:54.500 --> 03:56.967
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.300
TUTORING.

03:58.300 --> 04:01.000
DIDN'T THE TUTORS
AGREE TO NEVER WORK
WITH ME AGAIN?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.700
OH, INDEED, THEY DID.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.467
MY THOUGHT WAS TO MAKE
YOU A TUTOR.

04:05.467 --> 04:06.400
MR. FEENY,
WHEN DID YOU

04:06.400 --> 04:09.367
TAKE<i>YOUR </i>RIDE
IN THE DRYER?

04:09.367 --> 04:11.934
DO YOU KNOW JEFF LACY?

04:11.934 --> 04:12.967
YEAH. PLAYS BASKETBALL.

04:12.967 --> 04:16.000
MR. LACY HAS ATHLETIC
SCHOLARSHIPS OFFERS

04:16.000 --> 04:17.767
TO 20 COLLEGES,

04:17.767 --> 04:21.567
BUT HE NEEDS AT LEAST
A "C" AVERAGE TO GET IN.

04:21.567 --> 04:22.900
SO I TUTOR THIS KID,

04:22.900 --> 04:24.000
HELP HIM GET
INTO COLLEGE,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.400
HE TURNS PRO,
MAKES MILLIONS--
WHAT DO I GET?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.467
THE JOY OF HELPING
SOMEONE LEARN.

04:30.467 --> 04:33.000
BUT NO MONEY.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.500
AH. YOU GET USED TO IT.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.834
SO, DID YOU DECIDE YET?

04:39.834 --> 04:40.867
ABOUT WHAT?

04:40.867 --> 04:41.734
THE CONDO.

04:41.734 --> 04:43.667
I JUST TALKED
WITH THE LANDLORD.

04:43.667 --> 04:45.000
THERE WAS ANOTHER OFFER.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.100
I BOUGHT US
ANOTHER HALF DAY.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.500
YOU CAN'T KEEP US
HANGING.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.967
US? CORY, WHAT'S
IN THIS FOR YOU?

04:50.967 --> 04:54.233
WELL, IF I RENT
10 PLACES,
I GET A CRUISE.

04:54.233 --> 04:57.600
CORY, THERE'S NOT
GOING TO BE ANY MOVE.

04:57.600 --> 04:59.400
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

04:59.400 --> 05:02.467
I'VE BEEN MOVING
SINCE I WAS A KID.

05:02.467 --> 05:03.500
I'M SICK OF IT.

05:03.500 --> 05:06.133
I WANT THE NEXT MOVE
TO BE THE LAST.

05:06.133 --> 05:08.867
YEAH. BUT TURNER'S
DOING THIS FOR YOU.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.400
HE'S A GREAT FRIEND.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.233
YEAH. A FRIEND.

05:15.100 --> 05:18.767
JOHN, THIS DOES NOT TASTE
LIKE CHICKEN Ä L'ORANGE.

05:18.767 --> 05:20.100
DID YOU USE TANG?

05:20.100 --> 05:21.400
ELI, I SAID TASTE IT,

05:21.400 --> 05:23.600
NOT SUCK THE MEAT
OFF THE BONE.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.567
SOMEBODY'S GOT THEIR
APRON ON TOO TIGHT.

05:26.567 --> 05:27.500
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

05:27.500 --> 05:29.700
WELL, I SPOKE
TO AN ATTORNEY TODAY.

05:29.700 --> 05:32.467
GUESS WHAT?
48 HOURS, I'M SHAWN'S
LEGAL GUARDIAN.

05:32.467 --> 05:35.734
WHOA. BEEN ON THE FENCE
ABOUT THAT FOR A WHILE.

05:35.734 --> 05:37.033
IT'S WHAT HE NEEDS, MAN.

05:37.033 --> 05:41.900
I'VE COME THIS FAR--
MIGHT AS WELL
GO THE DISTANCE.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.200
WELL...

05:43.200 --> 05:46.100
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE
FOREVER, MAN.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.200
WHAT'LL CHANGE
YOUR LIFE FOREVER?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.567
SEE YOU LATER.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.467
SHAWN, AREN'T
YOU EATING DINNER
AT THE MATTHEWS'?

05:51.467 --> 05:53.400
YEAH. I WAS,
BUT I'M TIRED.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.100
I WANTED TO TURN IN
EARLY.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.200
CHICKEN Ä L'TANG.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.100
WHAT'S THE SPECIAL
OCCASION?

06:00.100 --> 06:01.500
I GOT A DATE.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.500
BUT, HEY,

06:02.500 --> 06:05.567
I CAN EASILY
STRETCH THIS
THREE WAYS.

06:05.567 --> 06:09.300
FINALLY GOT ANOTHER
LETTER FROM MY DAD.

06:09.300 --> 06:10.500
WHERE IS HE NOW?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.567
THAT TRUCK STOP
IN REDDING.

06:13.567 --> 06:14.934
WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR?

06:14.934 --> 06:16.800
IT'S 50 MILES
FROM HERE, JOHN.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.200
THE LEAST HE COULD DO
IS VISIT ME.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.500
HEY, YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

06:20.500 --> 06:23.200
I SPOKE TO AN ATTORNEY
TODAY.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.500
COUPLE OF SIGNATURES,

06:24.500 --> 06:25.834
AND I'M YOUR LEGAL
GUARDIAN.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.600
I THOUGHT YOU DID THAT
MONTHS AGO.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.767
I NEVER GOT AROUND
TO FILLING OUT
THE FORMS.

06:30.767 --> 06:33.000
GOT AROUND
TO FILLING THEM OUT?

06:33.000 --> 06:35.367
I'M SO SORRY
MY LIFE DIDN'T FIT

06:35.367 --> 06:36.700
INTO YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.600
WHOA. SHAWN,
CUT ME SOME SLACK.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.734
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.400
YEAH. YEAH,
I KNOW YOU ARE.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.400
HEY. ENJOY YOUR DATE.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.667
JEFF, HERE'S
AN EASY ONE.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.300
NOW, WHO WAS
THE KING OF FRANCE

06:55.300 --> 06:56.900
BEFORE LOUIS XIV?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.100
I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.300
COME ON.

06:59.300 --> 07:02.367
THIS STUFF'S DEFINITELY
GOING TO BE ON THE TEST.

07:02.367 --> 07:04.233
NOW, IT'S LOUIS THE...

07:04.233 --> 07:05.233
KING?

07:05.233 --> 07:06.233
OHH.

07:06.233 --> 07:07.400
LAST MINUTE OF PLAY.

07:07.400 --> 07:10.400
YOU ANSWER ONE QUESTION,
WE WIN THE BIG GAME.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.500
GO, BABY.
O.K.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.600
JEFF, IS THAT
YOUR PORSCHE?

07:13.600 --> 07:14.667
YES! WE WIN.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.900
YOU, UH, CARE FOR
A LITTLE RIDE, LADIES?

07:17.900 --> 07:20.500
HEY, UH, JEFF, COME ON.
LOOK AWAY. STUDYING.

07:20.500 --> 07:24.300
IS THAT ALL YOU
STRAIGHT-C STUDENTS
THINK ABOUT?

07:24.300 --> 07:25.600
NO, BUT I PROMISED
FEENY.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.600
BESIDES, WE CAN'T
ALL FIT IN A PORSCHE.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.967
THE GIRLS CAN
SIT ON YOUR LAP.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.867
BREAK TIME.

07:32.867 --> 07:36.700
ALL RIGHT, JEFF,
UH, WHO PAINTED
THE SISTINE CHAPEL?

07:36.700 --> 07:37.500
MICHELANGELO.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.467
JEFF!

07:38.467 --> 07:41.200
I'M JUST KIDDING.
WHO--WHO?

07:46.500 --> 07:47.600
WHAT A WASTED NIGHT.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.300
I JUST SPENT
THREE HOURS
IN A PORSCHE

07:50.300 --> 07:52.300
WITH A GIRL
IN MY LAP.

07:52.300 --> 07:54.834
I HATE WHEN
THAT HAPPENS.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.867
WHO DO YOU KNOW
WITH A PORSCHE?

07:56.867 --> 07:58.300
OH. YOU DIDN'T HEAR?

07:58.300 --> 08:01.567
THE SCHOOL'S
ALL-AMERICAN POINT GUARD
IS BEING TUTORED

08:01.567 --> 08:04.700
BY THE SCHOOL'S
ALL-AMERICAN CHEESEHEAD.

08:04.700 --> 08:06.600
CORY, GET THE PHONE.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.367
I DIDN'T HEAR
IT RINGING.

08:08.367 --> 08:11.667
OW! OH. I'LL GET IT.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.033
ERIC A TUTOR.

08:13.033 --> 08:15.800
I'M PROUD, YET CONFUSED.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.467
CAN WE BE SUED?

08:17.467 --> 08:20.100
HI, MRS. MATTHEWS,
MR. MATTHEWS.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.800
CAN YOU GUYS LEAVE?

08:22.800 --> 08:23.600
NO.
NO.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.200
DANG. I NEED
ANOTHER PLAN.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.734
SHAWN, LET'S JUST
GO OUTSIDE.

08:26.734 --> 08:31.400
MAN, YOU ARE GOOD
ON YOUR FEET.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.600
CORY, NOW THAT
YOUR PARENTS
HAVE LEFT THE ROOM,

08:34.600 --> 08:36.300
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TONIGHT?

08:36.300 --> 08:39.500
WELL, I'M SHOWING
A THREE-BEDROOM AT 7:30,

08:39.500 --> 08:41.000
BUT AFTER THAT I'M FREE.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.600
COOL. BECAUSE WE'RE
GOING TO SEE MY DAD.

08:43.600 --> 08:44.700
YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.500
YEAH. THIS TRUCK STOP
IN REDDING.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.400
BY MOTORCYCLE
THAT'S LESS
THAN A HOUR AWAY.

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
I'M THERE.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.500
BUT CAN TURNER GET US
BOTH ON HIS BIKE?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.967
TURNER'S NOT COMING.

08:54.967 --> 08:57.500
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.967
NAH. FORGET IT, SHAWN.
COUNT ME OUT.

09:00.967 --> 09:04.400
OH, COME ON. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE FIELD TRIP.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.600
WHAT'S THE WORST THING

09:05.600 --> 09:08.800
THAT COULD
POSSIBLY HAPPEN?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.867
YOU GET ONE
PHONE CALL.

09:10.867 --> 09:14.033
YOU GUYS REALLY
SAY THAT, HUH?

09:23.400 --> 09:26.033
NICE WAY
TO SPEND A DATE.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.600
LITTLE DINNER,

09:27.600 --> 09:28.867
LITTLE WINE,

09:28.867 --> 09:29.767
A LITTLE PRISON.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.100
AT LEAST
YOU GOT DINNER.

09:31.100 --> 09:34.467
SHAWN, THAT WAS
A STUPID, DANGEROUS
STUNT YOU PULLED.

09:34.467 --> 09:37.400
WHAT IF YOU LOST CONTROL
OF THE BIKE?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.400
I DIDN'T!

09:38.400 --> 09:39.667
YOU COULD'VE HURT
SOMEONE,

09:39.667 --> 09:41.033
AND I'D BE LEGALLY
RESPONSIBLE.

09:41.033 --> 09:43.467
YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

09:43.467 --> 09:44.700
LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE
FOR ME.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.800
THAT'S A CHEAP SHOT,
AND YOU KNOW IT!

09:46.800 --> 09:51.000
YEAH? THEN WHY'D YOU
TAKE YOUR TIME FILING
FOR GUARDIANSHIP?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.700
THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

09:52.700 --> 09:54.667
IT'S WHAT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT, JOHN.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.000
IT'S MY LIFE.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.100
YOU'VE GOT YOUR LIFE,
MY DAD'S GOT HIS LIFE,

09:59.100 --> 10:01.000
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE GOT NOTHING.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.467
I COULD'VE TAKEN YOU
TO YOUR DAD.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.367
IT'S--IT'S MORE
THAN THAT, JOHN.

10:05.367 --> 10:09.467
I'M TIRED OF FEELING
LIKE A GUEST WHEREVER
I GO.

10:09.467 --> 10:10.500
I KNOW, I KNOW.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.567
THIS HASN'T BEEN EASY
FOR ME EITHER.

10:12.567 --> 10:16.000
GOING FROM A SINGLE GUY
TO RAISING A 15-YEAR-OLD

10:16.000 --> 10:18.867
WASN'T ON MY
"TO DO" LIST.

10:18.867 --> 10:20.967
GREAT. WE'RE BOTH
IN EACH OTHER'S WAY.

10:20.967 --> 10:23.734
I OFFERED A BIGGER PLACE.
YOU DON'T WANT TO MOVE.

10:23.734 --> 10:27.100
YEAH? WELL, YOU'VE HAD
THE GUARDIANSHIP PAPERS
FOR MONTHS,

10:27.100 --> 10:30.500
AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T
FILLED THEM OUT.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.934
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE...

10:33.934 --> 10:35.000
MAYBE WE'RE BOTH AFRAID

10:35.000 --> 10:37.967
TO MAKE THIS LIVING
ARRANGEMENT PERMANENT.

10:37.967 --> 10:39.567
YEAH.

10:39.567 --> 10:43.133
MAYBE WE ARE.

10:43.133 --> 10:44.300
[DOORBELL RINGS]

10:44.300 --> 10:46.734
GOT IT. GOT IT.

10:49.500 --> 10:51.033
GOOD NEWS, COR.

10:51.033 --> 10:53.200
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS GOOD NEWS

10:53.200 --> 10:54.667
BEFORE I'VE HAD
MY GRAPENUTS.

10:54.667 --> 10:58.500
JUST GOING TO STORE
SOME STUFF HERE
UNTIL I SETTLE IN.

10:58.500 --> 10:59.667
SETTLE IN?

10:59.667 --> 11:02.367
YEAH. I'M MOVING BACK
TO THE TRAILER PARK.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.767
YOUR DAD FOUND YOUR MOM?
THEY'RE BACK?

11:04.767 --> 11:06.734
NO. I'M STAYING
WITH UNCLE MIKE.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.800
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

11:08.800 --> 11:11.367
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
THINK THIS BEFORE.

11:11.367 --> 11:14.700
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
ONLY MAKE ONE MORE MOVE,

11:14.700 --> 11:15.867
AND ONLY THE RIGHT ONE.

11:15.867 --> 11:19.033
I CAN'T KEEP WAITING
FOR MY DAD TO COME HOME.

11:19.033 --> 11:21.000
I'VE GOT TO GET ON
WITH MY LIFE.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.233
AT THE TRAILER PARK
I'LL BE SURROUNDED
BY FAMILY...

11:24.233 --> 11:27.600
AND THE FBI AGENTS
WHO SURROUND THEM.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.300
AH. OUR SON THE TUTOR.

11:36.300 --> 11:37.834
HOW WAS STUDYING
WITH JEFF?

11:37.834 --> 11:40.967
NAG, NAG, NAG.
WHAT ARE YOU, MY MOM?

11:40.967 --> 11:43.000
YES. AND WHAT
A JOY IT IS.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.467
SORRY, MOM.
I SHOULDN'T TAKE
MY ANGER OUT ON YOU.

11:46.467 --> 11:48.300
THAT'S WHAT
CORY'S FOR. CORY!

11:48.300 --> 11:50.600
ERIC, WHAT'S
THE PROBLEM?

11:50.600 --> 11:51.934
DAD,

11:51.934 --> 11:54.900
I RECITE THE ENTIRE
HISTORY OF EUROPE
TO THIS KID,

11:54.900 --> 11:57.000
FROM HENRY IV
TO TALLEYRAND.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.233
YOU KNOW
WHAT HE SAYS?

11:58.233 --> 12:01.367
HE SAYS, "I CAN BURP
THROUGH MY EARS."

12:01.367 --> 12:02.834
AND THEN HE DOES IT!

12:02.834 --> 12:04.233
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU TRIED.

12:04.233 --> 12:06.800
HE'S GOT 20 COLLEGES
THAT WANT HIM,

12:06.800 --> 12:08.567
AND I CAN'T
GET INTO ONE.

12:08.567 --> 12:10.700
ERIC, YOU WILL
GET INTO COLLEGE,

12:10.700 --> 12:13.000
AND YOU WILL HAVE
EARNED IT.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.500
MAYBE JEFF'S
ON TO SOMETHING.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.467
MAYBE I HAVE
AN UNTAPPED TALENT

12:17.467 --> 12:19.600
THAT COULD GUIDE ME
THROUGH LIFE.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.900
APPLE...SINK.
HE SHOOTS.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.934
HE SUCKS!

12:28.834 --> 12:30.000
HE PAYS.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.200
EAR BURPS
IT IS, THEN.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.367
YOU KNOW,
MOM, DAD...

12:36.367 --> 12:37.600
WHEN ERIC'S
OFF TO COLLEGE,

12:37.600 --> 12:41.200
THAT BIG OLD ROOM
OF OURS IS GOING
TO SEEM LONELY.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
YOUR ANGLE?

12:42.200 --> 12:44.600
SHAWN NEEDS
A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.700
HE'S NOT HAPPY
AT MR. TURNER'S?

12:46.700 --> 12:48.367
IT'S NOT REALLY
HIS HOME.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.467
THERE'S ALWAYS ROOM
FOR SHAWN HERE,

12:50.467 --> 12:52.367
BUT THIS WOULDN'T BE
HIS HOME.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.000
IT'D BE ANOTHER
TEMPORARY SOLUTION.

12:54.000 --> 12:57.200
I THINK WHAT SHAWN NEEDS
IS SOMETHING PERMANENT.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.000
WHAT DOES SHAWN'S DAD
HAVE TO SAY?

12:59.000 --> 13:01.900
WHO KNOWS?
NO ONE TALKS
IN THAT FAMILY.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.033
IF SHAWN WERE MY SON,

13:03.033 --> 13:06.834
I'D LIKE TO BE CONSULTED
ABOUT HIS FUTURE.

13:17.834 --> 13:21.200
O.K., TOPANGA,
JUST ACT NATURAL
AND TRY AND FIT IN.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.233
O.K., BUT I'M
NOT GOING TO SPIT.

13:24.233 --> 13:26.934
I DON'T SEE
SHAWN'S DAD ANYWHERE.

13:26.934 --> 13:28.200
O.K., LET'S GO.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.400
NO. NO, WE'RE ON
A MISSION.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.100
NOW, COVER ME.
O.K.

13:32.100 --> 13:37.033
OH, I REALLY HOPE
I DON'T HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.500
GENTLEMEN.

13:40.300 --> 13:43.000
NOW THAT I'VE BROKEN
THE ICE,

13:43.000 --> 13:44.100
UH, ANYONE HERE

13:44.100 --> 13:47.400
KNOW A GUY NAMED
CHET HUNTER?

13:50.467 --> 13:51.400
YOU KNOW,

13:51.400 --> 13:53.300
I DID FORGET
TO CHALK MY NOSE

13:53.300 --> 13:55.033
BEFORE I LEFT
THE HOUSE. THANKS.

13:55.033 --> 13:58.100
I'M SICK OF WATCHING YOU
SHOOT POOL ALL NIGHT.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.200
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO TREAT ME

14:00.200 --> 14:01.734
LIKE A DESIRABLE WOMAN,

14:01.734 --> 14:04.400
THEN I'LL FIND ME
A MAN THAT CAN.

14:04.400 --> 14:05.600
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MISTER?

14:05.600 --> 14:07.700
YOU LOOK LIKE
A MAN WHO KNOWS

14:07.700 --> 14:09.600
HOW TO TREAT
A WOMAN RIGHT.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.367
OHH...TINGLE.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.600
YOU KNOW HOW TO DANCE?

14:13.600 --> 14:16.467
TEACH ME. PLEASE.

14:19.467 --> 14:21.367
CORY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

14:21.367 --> 14:25.100
WELL, I'M TRYING TO SEE
WHAT THIS WOMAN KNOWS--

14:25.100 --> 14:27.000
WHICH I'M THINKING
IS AN AWFUL LOT.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.567
DO YOU THINK THIS
IS A PRODUCTIVE USE
OF OUR TIME?

14:30.567 --> 14:31.867
OH. ABSOLUTELY.

14:31.867 --> 14:34.500
HEY. I FOUND HIM FIRST.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.600
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.600
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO STEP OUTSIDE?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.200
YEAH, I WOULD.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.800
OH-HO,
THIS IS GREAT.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.934
LORD LOVE A DUCK.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.600
IS THAT WHO
I THINK IT IS?

14:45.600 --> 14:48.667
YEAH, UH, MR. HUNTER,
IT'S ME, CORY MATTHEWS.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.800
OH. SORRY. MY MISTAKE.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.300
NO, NO.
I'M SHAWN'S FRIEND.

14:53.300 --> 14:55.367
OH. RIGHT.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.467
RIGHT.

14:56.467 --> 14:58.100
HOW YOU BEEN?

14:58.100 --> 14:59.500
STEP INTO MY OFFICE.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.400
PIE?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
NO, THANKS.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.400
NO. I'M ASKING YOU,
DO YOU THINK IT'S PIE?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.700
I GOT IT OUT
OF THE DIRTIES.

15:06.700 --> 15:08.500
IT'S EITHER
APPLE BROWN BETTY

15:08.500 --> 15:09.700
OR DIM SUM.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.967
SO, UH,
YOU WORKING HERE?

15:11.967 --> 15:13.600
YEAH, JUST TILL
I PAY OFF

15:13.600 --> 15:15.000
SOME PARKING TICKETS,

15:15.000 --> 15:18.967
THEN I'M BACK
ON THE ROAD LOOKING
FOR MY WIFE VERNA.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.867
YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED?

15:20.867 --> 15:22.233
OH. I'M 15.

15:22.233 --> 15:24.934
NOW, NOW, NOW.
DON'T YOU GIVE UP HOPE.

15:24.934 --> 15:28.400
VERNA AND I WERE 16
BEFORE WE GOT HITCHED.

15:28.400 --> 15:29.667
SHE WANTED TO WAIT

15:29.667 --> 15:32.233
TILL SHE GOT OUT
OF THE NAVY.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.033
SO, CORTEZ,

15:33.033 --> 15:34.500
WHAT BRINGS YOU UP HERE?

15:34.500 --> 15:37.834
I ACTUALLY CAME TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SHAWN.

15:37.834 --> 15:38.834
HE SICK?

15:38.834 --> 15:41.200
NO! NO, NO.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.567
HE'S JUST ALL CONFUSED.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.400
AND, WELL, I THINK
HE REALLY MISSES YOU.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.100
WELL, I MISS HIM, TOO.
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
THEN COME BACK FOR HIM.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.567
I--HE NEEDS YOU THERE.

15:51.567 --> 15:54.233
NAH. SHAWN'S BETTER OFF
WHERE HE IS.

15:54.233 --> 15:57.667
TURNER SENDS ME
HIS REPORT CARDS
AND HIS TESTS.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.967
EVEN SENT ME
A PICTURE OF HIM

15:59.967 --> 16:01.734
AND THAT NEW
GIRLFRIEND OF HIS.

16:01.734 --> 16:04.900
REMINDS ME OF HIS MOM...
ABOUT A THOUSAND
YEARS AGO.

16:04.900 --> 16:08.467
BUT, SEE, SHAWN NEEDS
FAMILY IN HIS LIFE,

16:08.467 --> 16:09.667
AND THAT'S YOU.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.500
AW, SON. SHAWN'S
BETTER OFF WHERE HE IS

16:12.500 --> 16:14.467
THAN HE'D EVER BE
WITH ME.

16:14.467 --> 16:16.400
MR. TURNER'S
GREAT AND ALL, O.K.,

16:16.400 --> 16:19.133
BUT HE'S HIS FRIEND.
HE'S NOT HIS FATHER.

16:19.133 --> 16:20.233
YOU ARE.

16:20.233 --> 16:23.567
AND WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT,

16:23.567 --> 16:25.600
IF YOU LOVE HIM,
MR. HUNTER,

16:25.600 --> 16:27.400
THEN COME BACK
FOR HIM.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.200
I LOVE HIM.

16:29.200 --> 16:33.033
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH,
I CAN'T GO BACK.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.200
BUT YOU, UH,

16:34.200 --> 16:37.133
YOU TELL SHAWN
HIS DADDY SAID,

16:37.133 --> 16:39.200
"HEY."

16:40.400 --> 16:42.000
IF YOU TEASE THAT HAIR,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.700
YOU'D BE 6 FEET TALL.

16:43.700 --> 16:45.400
O.K., LOUANNE,
LET'S DO IT.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.767
LAMBCHOP, YOU HAVE
SOME MORE COFFEE,
THIS MAY TAKE AWHILE.

16:54.033 --> 16:56.033
UH, MR. FEENY.

16:56.033 --> 16:57.967
YOU KNOW, BEFORE YOU
GRADE THE MIDTERMS--

16:57.967 --> 17:00.400
I ALREADY HAVE,
MR. MATTHEWS.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.734
[GASPS]

17:01.734 --> 17:03.600
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

17:03.600 --> 17:05.233
I WORKED REALLY HARD
WITH JEFF,

17:05.233 --> 17:09.100
BUT YOU CAN'T TEACH
SOMEBODY IF THEY DON'T
WANT TO LEARN.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.300
WELL, HOW DO YOU
EXPLAIN THIS?

17:11.300 --> 17:13.400
YOU GAVE JEFF A C-PLUS?

17:13.400 --> 17:14.867
NO, NO. YOU DID.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.300
I THOUGHT THE GUY
WAS A TOTAL LOST CAUSE.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.900
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN LOST CAUSES.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.367
I THINK THIS IS YOURS.

17:21.367 --> 17:24.867
OH. WAIT. MR. FEENY,
YOU DIDN'T FINISH
YOUR SENTENCE HERE.

17:24.867 --> 17:27.667
YOU JUST PUT "A".
"A" WHAT?

17:29.200 --> 17:32.000
THAT'S YOUR GRADE, ERIC.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.600
IT IS?

17:33.600 --> 17:35.300
IT IS. HA HA.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.467
AHEM.

17:36.467 --> 17:39.300
MR. FEENY,
AS I STAND HERE
IN FRONT OF YOU,

17:39.300 --> 17:41.133
MY FELLOW STUDENTS,

17:41.133 --> 17:42.500
THE FACULTY,
I MUST SAY--

17:42.500 --> 17:46.200
OH, GIVE IT UP, MAN.
IT'S JUST ONE TEST.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.200
HOWEVER,
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.567
HEY, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

17:50.567 --> 17:51.600
MR. FEENY.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.934
THIS WAS YOUR PLAN
ALL ALONG?

17:53.934 --> 17:55.100
I TEACH JEFF,

17:55.100 --> 17:57.100
BUT REALLY,
I TEACH MYSELF.

17:57.100 --> 18:01.800
MR. FEENY,
YOU SLY, SLY DOG.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.600
GOT LUCKY ON THAT ONE.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.200
THANKS, MIKE.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.600
I'M GLAD TO SEE
THAT PROMOTION CAME.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.000
DAD?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.200
SHAWN?

18:12.200 --> 18:13.133
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

18:13.133 --> 18:15.500
GUESS I COULD ASK
THE SAME THING.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.400
EVENING, OFFICER.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.600
HEY, HERE'S A HINT, SON.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.800
WHENEVER YOU FIND
YOURSELF IN CUSTODY,
SMILE.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.400
NOBODY EVER
BILLY-CLUBBED
A HAPPY MAN.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.300
SIT DOWN.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.300
SO, DAD,

18:26.300 --> 18:28.767
LONG TIME.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.200
WELL, RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.467
HOW'D YOU EVER
FIND ME HERE?

18:32.467 --> 18:33.834
BETTER QUESTION--

18:33.834 --> 18:36.200
HOW'D YOU FIND
YOURSELF HERE?

18:36.200 --> 18:38.500
WELL, UM, I MOVED OUT
OF TURNER'S.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.500
I WAS GOING TO MOVE IN
WITH UNCLE MIKE,

18:41.500 --> 18:42.734
BUT HIS TRAILER'S GONE.

18:42.734 --> 18:45.400
A COP FOUND ME
SLEEPING IN THE PARK.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.500
THEY TURN ON THE SWIRLY
LIGHTS COMING IN?

18:48.500 --> 18:49.900
THAT'S ALWAYS FUN.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.233
SO, UH...

18:51.233 --> 18:53.033
SO, ANY LUCK
FINDING MOM?

18:53.033 --> 18:55.000
SAW HER A COUPLE
OF MONTHS AGO.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.100
HAD HER CORNERED
IN MISSISSIPPI.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.100
SHE DOVE OFF
THE RIVER BOAT.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.400
THE WOMAN SWIMS
LIKE A SEAL.

19:00.400 --> 19:03.200
HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO KEEP CHASING HER?

19:03.200 --> 19:06.600
LONG ENOUGH FOR HER
TO CLEAR HER HEAD.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.400
IT'S BEEN A YEAR.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.400
WOMAN'S GOT A BIG HEAD.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.233
COME ON. WHO ARE YOU
KIDDING?

19:13.233 --> 19:15.300
YEAH. I SUPPOSE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:15.300 --> 19:18.300
IF YOUR MAMA WANTED ME
TO CATCH HER,

19:18.300 --> 19:19.900
WELL, SHE'D BE CAUGHT.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.900
SO, UH...

19:21.900 --> 19:23.600
SO, WHAT'S NEXT?

19:23.600 --> 19:25.500
NEXT WE GET YOU
OUT OF HERE

19:25.500 --> 19:27.500
AND BACK TO TURNER'S
WHERE YOU BELONG.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.500
DAD, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING...

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
MAYBE YOU COULD
STICK AROUND AWHILE.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.700
AHEM.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.400
THERE AIN'T NOTHING
IN THIS TOWN FOR ME.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.200
YEAH, THERE IS. ME.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.300
I LEFT YOU AT TURNER'S

19:40.300 --> 19:43.300
BECAUSE IN MY MIND
IT WAS A BETTER PLACE.

19:43.300 --> 19:46.767
IT'S A GOOD PLACE,
BUT I WOULDN'T
CALL IT BETTER.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.567
IT WASN'T WITH YOU,

19:48.567 --> 19:50.000
IT WASN'T HOME.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.767
I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

19:51.767 --> 19:55.033
COME ON, DAD.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

19:55.033 --> 19:57.700
NO CHASING.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.400
BESIDES...

19:59.400 --> 20:00.900
I NEED YOU...

20:00.900 --> 20:05.000
AND I'M THINKING
YOU NEED ME.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.233
WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER,
I AIN'T MUCH OF A COOK.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.667
CAN'T BE ANY WORSE
THAN MOM.

20:10.667 --> 20:13.100
HA HA. AIN'T THAT
THE TRUTH.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.567
I'M GOING TO DO
SOMETHING I HAVEN'T DONE

20:15.567 --> 20:17.200
SINCE YOU WERE
VERY LITTLE.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.467
GET A JOB?
HECK NO!

20:19.467 --> 20:21.500
SOMETHING BETTER.

20:23.934 --> 20:25.100
HUNTER.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.867
YOU'VE BEEN
BAILED.

20:26.867 --> 20:28.000
WHICH ONE?

20:28.000 --> 20:28.900
LITTLE ONE.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.600
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.300
CHET?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.567
LOOK AT ME, TEACH,
I'M A BAD SEED.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.700
I WAS COMING OVER WHEN
I RAN INTO A SPEED TRAP

20:39.700 --> 20:42.200
AND A PILE OF UNPAID
PARKING TICKETS.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.100
LET ME GUESS
WHO'S BAILING YOU.

20:44.100 --> 20:45.500
WELL, I'D BE
MUCH OBLIGED.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.667
GOT TO GET OUT
TO TAKE CARE OF SHAWN.

20:48.667 --> 20:49.600
YOU MEAN?

20:49.600 --> 20:50.734
I MEAN, I'M STAYING.

20:50.734 --> 20:53.867
I WOULDN'T BE MUCH
OF A FATHER OTHERWISE.

20:53.867 --> 20:55.133
YOUR JOB'S DONE.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.200
HEY. SHAWN.

20:56.200 --> 20:59.367
DAD, CAN I TALK TO JOHN
ALONE FOR A MINUTE.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.467
SURE. I'D STEP OUTSIDE,
BUT THEY'D SHOOT ME.

21:02.467 --> 21:04.000
I DON'T EVEN NEED
TO ASK.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.600
I CAN TELL THIS
IS WHAT YOU WANT.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.367
JOHN, LIKE WE SAID,
WE KNEW THAT THIS
WASN'T FOREVER.

21:11.367 --> 21:12.200
A ROOF.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.767
AND A GOOD FRIEND.

21:13.767 --> 21:14.667
THE BEST.

21:14.667 --> 21:15.600
THANKS.

21:15.600 --> 21:20.300
I OWE YOU, YOU PUT UP
WITH A LOT.

21:20.300 --> 21:21.400
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

21:29.767 --> 21:31.600
SHAWN, I'LL MEET YOU
DOWNSTAIRS.

21:31.600 --> 21:35.600
ANOTHER PARKING TICKET,
AND OUR HOME GETS
THE DENVER BOOT.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.233
HEY, YOU KIDS, GET OFF
MY FRONT PORCH!

21:40.300 --> 21:42.133
WELL, COR, WISH ME LUCK.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.300
YOU GOT IT.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.200
MY DAD TOLD ME
ABOUT HOW YOU
TRACKED HIM DOWN.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.000
SHAWN, WE'RE FRIENDS.
WE HELP EACH OTHER OUT.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.100
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.200
KNOW WHAT I'VE WANTED
TO DO FOR A LONG TIME?

21:54.200 --> 21:57.200
INVITE YOU TO MY HOUSE
FOR DINNER.

21:57.200 --> 21:58.300
WHO'S COOKING?

21:58.300 --> 22:00.100
YOU ARE.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.300
HUH.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.767
I'M THERE.

22:02.767 --> 22:05.500
O.K. THAT'S
JUST ABOUT IT.

22:06.734 --> 22:08.767
DAD, THAT'S
MR. TURNER'S TV.

22:08.767 --> 22:10.767
WELL, HECK, YOU BEEN
HERE A YEAR.

22:10.767 --> 22:13.767
BESIDES, TEACHERS
SHOULDN'T BE WATCHING
TELEVISION ANYWAY.
