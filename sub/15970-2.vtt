01:18.840 --> 01:21.560
(man on video) <i>To journey beyond</i>
<i>the reaches of our solar system</i>

01:21.640 --> 01:23.240
<i>to the closest star...</i>

01:23.920 --> 01:28.160
<i>would mean traveling the distance</i>
<i>of more than 5 trillion miles.</i>

01:29.040 --> 01:33.760
<i>Yet the dimensions of the cosmos</i>
<i>are so unimaginably vast</i>

01:33.840 --> 01:35.960
<i>units of measurement</i>
<i>become virtually...</i>

01:36.040 --> 01:38.640
(Angela)
<i>I've been kissed three times.</i>

01:38.720 --> 01:40.120
<i>No, four times.</i>

01:41.360 --> 01:43.080
<i>No, three times.</i>

01:43.880 --> 01:46.120
<i>All of them were people</i>
<i>I never saw again...</i>

01:47.360 --> 01:49.680
<i>which I hope doesn't,</i>
<i>like, mean something.</i>

01:49.760 --> 01:51.880
(dramatic music playing)

01:54.200 --> 01:56.800
<i>One was this counselor</i>
<i>at this YMCA camp.</i>

02:00.920 --> 02:03.840
<i>Except he already</i>
<i>had a girlfriend.</i>

02:09.960 --> 02:12.120
(kisses)

02:18.480 --> 02:22.160
(man on video)<i> The inner core of</i>
<i>the star now implodes violently,</i>

02:22.240 --> 02:25.840
<i>producing an explosion</i>
<i>of unparalleled intensity.</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:34.800
(Angela)<i> One was this usher at my mother's</i>
<i>cousin's wedding two years ago.</i>

02:34.880 --> 02:36.400
(indistinct chatter)

02:38.480 --> 02:40.200
<i>The wedding was in Milwaukee.</i>

02:43.400 --> 02:46.360
<i>We stayed over at a motor lodge</i>
<i>with a heated pool.</i>

02:49.320 --> 02:51.320
<i>It was a double-ring ceremony.</i>

02:55.120 --> 02:57.560
<i>He was staring at me</i>
<i>all through the ceremony.</i>

02:58.200 --> 02:59.280
(chuckles)

03:03.640 --> 03:04.640
(Angela)
<i>Later...</i>

03:05.880 --> 03:08.600
<i>I found out he only kissed me</i>
<i>'cause he had lost a bet.</i>

03:22.640 --> 03:25.760
<i>The third kiss</i>
<i>is the hardest to describe.</i>

03:27.080 --> 03:30.080
<i>It was this guy I met</i>
<i>on the beach last summer.</i>

03:33.960 --> 03:35.360
<i>It was labor day.</i>

03:36.960 --> 03:39.360
<i>It was the day</i>
<i>I swam out too far.</i>

03:48.320 --> 03:52.800
<i>That was the most...</i>
<i>exciting one.</i>

03:54.680 --> 03:57.800
<i>Except it may not count</i>
<i>as an actual kiss...</i>

03:59.560 --> 04:01.760
<i>since I was kind of...</i>

04:03.240 --> 04:04.560
<i>unconscious.</i>

04:04.640 --> 04:06.680
(indistinct chatter)

04:11.520 --> 04:14.160
<i>I've never had</i>
<i>an actual boyfriend.</i>

04:14.240 --> 04:16.000
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if that's normal or not.</i>

04:16.080 --> 04:18.120
-You know that girl Dayna?
-Dayna Odenkirk?

04:18.200 --> 04:22.320
Dayna. She's got hair tails
and three studs in each ear.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.920
She used to wear eyeliner like cat-woman.
Now she wears it smudged.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Her feet are perfect...
small with a high arch.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.840
So, what about her?

04:29.920 --> 04:31.240
Nothing.
She just annoys me.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.880
Her lips are so puffed out,
it's like she siliconed them.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.960
Really? You think she did?

04:37.040 --> 04:39.560
Really, you think
she siliconed her lips? Really?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.440
Angela, he's gone.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.760
-You can talk like a normal person.
-Oh, God.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.880
You got to progress
to the next phase of this.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.840
Think of Rickie and me.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.560
How much more can we take?

04:52.640 --> 04:55.920
I don't want to look, like,
I am throwing myself at him.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.080
Excuse me.

04:58.160 --> 05:03.280
People throwing themselves at people...
is like the basis of civilization.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.200
She has a point.

05:07.720 --> 05:12.120
(Angela) <i>If Jordan Catalano is, like,</i>
<i>nearby, my entire body knows it,</i>

05:12.200 --> 05:14.480
<i>like one of those dogs</i>
<i>that point?</i>

05:14.560 --> 05:17.880
<i>I'll keep talking and stuff, but</i>
<i>my mind won't even know what I'm saying.</i>

05:18.720 --> 05:21.160
<i>I wonder</i>
<i>if there's a term for this.</i>

05:21.240 --> 05:24.440
(teacher) Okay, now before
we cut our hearts open...

05:25.600 --> 05:26.720
people...

05:27.320 --> 05:28.880
it's a pig heart.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.800
Students opposed
to the practice of vivisection

05:31.880 --> 05:34.440
may do research
at the library instead,

05:34.520 --> 05:37.280
but you must put
this belief in writing.

05:37.360 --> 05:38.880
Now to review.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.480
An experiment
must test a what?

05:42.360 --> 05:44.000
A hypothesis.

05:45.360 --> 05:49.680
And a hypothesis consists of several...
anybody?

05:50.280 --> 05:52.560
Several assumptions.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.640
And true experimentation
depends upon...

05:57.240 --> 05:59.360
guys, precision...

06:00.280 --> 06:04.720
observation... and clear,
concise communication.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.960
-(Graham) What?
-I said I'm leaving now,

06:08.040 --> 06:11.840
so... I guess I don't rate
a kiss goodbye.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.000
-Wait. What?
-Nothing. It's...

06:15.760 --> 06:17.760
just you don't kiss me goodbye
in the mornings anymore.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.440
We'll see each other
in 40 minutes.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.200
I know, but, just because
we're working together,

06:21.280 --> 06:22.360
that's no reason to stop...

06:22.440 --> 06:24.960
This isn't the time
to start anything.

06:25.040 --> 06:29.480
I'm sorry, I forgot. A kiss
must result in intercourse.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.880
Well, it's a law in this state.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.080
There could be no kissing
for kissing's sake.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.600
A kiss must lead somewhere.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.840
Where did they drill that into you?
Was it shop class?

06:45.120 --> 06:45.920
I can't believe it.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.800
I swore I'd never fight with you again
this early in the morning.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.920
This isn't a fight.
It's goodbye.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.760
(kisses)

06:55.840 --> 06:57.880
(dramatic music playing)

07:01.400 --> 07:03.880
What are the elements
of a true experiment?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.960
What sort of activity
is an experiment?

07:07.880 --> 07:11.320
It's a purposeful activity
designed to solve a what?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.480
A particular problem.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.080
(taps on machine)

07:26.680 --> 07:28.320
How much money did you lose?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.040
None.

07:31.120 --> 07:36.120
So... Catalano... so, Tino says
you can get my girlfriend a fake I.D.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.440
So?
So could Tino.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.960
Oh, yeah, well...
he does me so many favors,

07:43.040 --> 07:44.640
I feel like
I'm wearing him thin.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.760
The kind with
that out-of-state look,

07:46.840 --> 07:49.000
like from Georgia
or something?

07:49.760 --> 07:51.400
My girlfriend really needs one.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.840
Angela.

07:52.920 --> 07:53.920
It's like an emergency.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.800
Why doesn't she ask for herself?

07:58.320 --> 07:59.520
That's a long story.

08:00.640 --> 08:02.960
She's, uh... French.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.680
She's from France.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.880
-Get out of here.
-Seriously. And with certain words,

08:13.960 --> 08:18.280
she'll like forget how to
pronounce them or something.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.360
It's like a mental block
type of thing.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.480
-That girl I see you with...
-Angela. Chase.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.920
Is... French.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.280
She was born there. She hasn't
lived there in quite a while.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.040
She's a US Citizen and all.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.560
What kind of I.D.?

08:43.360 --> 08:44.560
Okay, important.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.800
I need to see the hands of those handing
in their extra-credit experiments

08:47.880 --> 08:48.960
on Friday.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.800
Okay, Uh...
Justin...

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
Sonya...

08:56.080 --> 08:58.440
-Angela. Angela!
-Michael...

09:00.480 --> 09:01.680
Come here.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.600
Okay, so that's...
Jeremy...

09:06.200 --> 09:07.320
Charlotte...

09:08.160 --> 09:09.840
Tiffany. Okay.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.480
Sean...
Yvette...

09:14.800 --> 09:16.080
Leander.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.960
Okay, Sharon...

09:21.240 --> 09:23.200
Shane, and, uh...

09:24.080 --> 09:25.200
Brian?

09:26.920 --> 09:28.160
What happened
to your lab partner?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.800
-She almost fainted, so...
-Ohh.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.160
Oh. And your extra-credit
project is?

09:36.920 --> 09:39.080
Um, controlled release
of energy,

09:39.160 --> 09:41.080
construction and use
of a volumeter.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.480
Is that something you worked on
alone or with Angela?

09:44.560 --> 09:46.600
-With Angela.
-(ring bells)

09:47.200 --> 09:50.760
Okay, people, your hearts
must be clearly labeled

09:50.840 --> 09:52.480
before returning them
to the cart.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.040
Uh, please do not drip.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.760
What?

10:00.840 --> 10:03.400
Like Angela really helped you
with your volumeter?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.680
She's planning to.

10:05.920 --> 10:08.720
Look, I mean, why would I say it
if it wasn't true?

10:08.800 --> 10:12.320
Why would you say she was
fainting? Okay, what was that?

10:12.920 --> 10:15.280
I mean, some of us
actually work, you know?

10:15.360 --> 10:19.400
We don't just expect extra credit
because our lab partner's smart.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.400
She takes advantage of you,
and you totally let her.

10:26.040 --> 10:27.120
I pity you.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.120
Oh, my God.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.520
I did it for you.
It's a good thing.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.840
It's a definite good thing.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.280
Wait, you were there, too?

10:42.360 --> 10:45.600
Well, no, but she told me
the whole thing.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.920
I bet people can die
of embarrassment.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
I bet it's been
medically proven.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.200
Hey, worst case... you get an out-of-state
I.D., which you need anyway.

10:54.280 --> 10:55.280
Just wait.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.600
-Tell me everything he said.
-You will definitely thank me.

10:59.680 --> 11:03.960
It's true. I mean, from what she
told me, which was everything.

11:04.040 --> 11:05.680
You should be
thanking me right now.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.480
Let's stop talking
about this.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.640
Okay.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.440
So...

11:12.240 --> 11:14.680
how did he act?
Did he act bored or...

11:15.840 --> 11:18.240
He flopped on the floor.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.040
Uncontrollably, okay?
(laughs)

11:20.120 --> 11:21.600
Rickie had to hold down
his tongue.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.520
And I wasn't even there.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.720
(laughs)

11:28.000 --> 11:29.400
(Brian)
Hey, Chase.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.520
(Angela) <i>What I, like, dread</i>
<i>is when people who know you</i>

11:33.600 --> 11:36.560
<i>in completely different ways</i>
<i>end up in the same area.</i>

11:37.440 --> 11:39.440
(Brian) Thanks for leaving me
your whole heart to clean up.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.200
(Angela) <i>You have to develop this</i>
<i>combination you on the spot.</i>

11:43.280 --> 11:46.920
Chavatal, she thinks we're both
working on my volumeter.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.640
His what?

11:48.720 --> 11:51.200
It's this experiment.
There's, like, a mouse involved.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.880
What's your name again?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.320
You think that's fair?
I do all the work...

11:55.400 --> 11:58.840
-I never said I was doing it.
-She's giving you credit, so...

11:59.840 --> 12:02.840
Look, I already executed
the entire apparatus.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.120
The apparatus.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.680
So I think the least you can do
is help me work on it.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.440
Tomorrow night.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.800
-Because...
-He wants you to work on his apparatus.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.400
Shut up! Okay.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.880
What would your parents say?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.400
They're out of town! Which is...

12:20.720 --> 12:22.880
-Which has nothing--
-She'll be there.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.320
-Rayanne!
-What?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.960
-Rayanne.
-It's perfect.

12:31.040 --> 12:33.360
-As what?
-Excuse me, what is a volumeter?

12:33.440 --> 12:37.280
-As a place to bring Jordan Catalano.
-Are you crazy?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.720
-Were you raised in a satanic cult?
-She wishes.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.520
Jordan Catalano?

12:43.600 --> 12:46.400
At Brian Krakow's house?

12:46.480 --> 12:48.800
It's, like, against nature
or something.

12:48.880 --> 12:52.520
-So?
-Chase, you going to help me or not?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.240
Yes or no?

12:56.480 --> 12:57.800
Oh, God.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.720
Yes.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.120
(dramatic music playing)

13:16.800 --> 13:18.040
So the plan is...

13:18.720 --> 13:20.040
Wait. What's the plan?

13:20.120 --> 13:23.800
You are going to love having a fake I.D.
I collect them. I'm addicted.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.240
Okay, the plan.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.560
You go to what's-his-name's,
help him with his, uh...

13:27.640 --> 13:28.760
Volume thing.

13:28.840 --> 13:33.920
Right. Meanwhile, Rickie and I and Jordan
Catalano will procure you an I.D.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.720
Which we will then bring back
to what's-his-name's.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.800
Where you and Jordan Catalano
will then be.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.280
Okay, in my humble opinion,
he's Jordan Catalano.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.040
He won't do any of this.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.040
(door opens)

13:49.080 --> 13:51.160
Sharon refuses to come in.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.480
-Okay.
-(door closes)

13:53.560 --> 13:55.800
-What's the deal?
-You tell me.

13:56.600 --> 14:01.000
All Sharon will say is that, um,
Angela had been acting distant,

14:01.080 --> 14:03.640
so she called her on it
in the girls' room one day...

14:04.600 --> 14:06.160
and they both cried.

14:06.240 --> 14:10.440
Ever since then, they've kind of avoided
each other, and that's all I know.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.760
It's a miniseries
compared to what I know.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.080
Hey, Cherski.

14:25.160 --> 14:28.680
So, by the way, Chase is coming
over tomorrow night...

14:28.760 --> 14:32.360
to... you know...
compile data.

14:33.280 --> 14:34.680
So?

14:34.760 --> 14:36.800
So... she's coming over.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.120
So... to help me,
so that obviously proves that...

14:40.200 --> 14:41.360
What?

14:41.440 --> 14:44.280
That you were obviously wrong
about the whole situation.

14:44.360 --> 14:48.200
Right. I was wrong, Krakow.
Just keep telling yourself that.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.040
-Remember when we stopped speaking?
-Yes...

15:01.120 --> 15:04.120
'Cause you told everybody that I made out
with Mitchell Moscarelli

15:04.200 --> 15:05.920
behind the duck pond.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.400
Well, you did make out
with Mitchell Moscarelli.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.480
But not behind the duck pond.

15:10.560 --> 15:12.040
(laughs)

15:12.120 --> 15:13.200
Thanks.

15:14.560 --> 15:17.360
I'll probably just put this
in my closet.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.440
Should I cut my hair short?

15:23.640 --> 15:25.840
I can't take this. I feel sick.

15:25.920 --> 15:26.920
Look, I was there.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.600
And I was practically there
from hearing it so many times.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.560
And he is definitely
semi-interested.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.680
So you think he...

15:33.760 --> 15:37.920
I think part of him is partly interested
in you.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.000
Definitely.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.840
But he's got other things
on his mind.

15:40.920 --> 15:44.200
That's the part that's so unfair.
I have nothing else on my mind.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.280
How come I have to be the one
sitting around analyzing him

15:47.360 --> 15:53.760
in microscopic detail, and he gets to
be the one with other things on his mind?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.160
That... is deep.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.440
It's this working together.
It's pushing us apart.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.600
God, that sounds like
a <i>Redbook</i> article.

16:03.680 --> 16:07.240
Listen...
if you got to cut it, cut it.

16:07.320 --> 16:11.080
You know? But let's face it.
Men like long hair.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.600
Who cares what they like?

16:13.440 --> 16:15.920
But they supposedly
like variety, don't they?

16:16.000 --> 16:19.240
(sighs) They like long hair, and they
like for you to wear red.

16:19.320 --> 16:23.040
But don't they supposedly like it
if you show up looking different?

16:23.120 --> 16:25.360
(scoffs) Oh, God.
Shoot me, will you?

16:25.440 --> 16:28.120
Look. Your Cinderella.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.920
I remember when
your dad gave you this.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.040
I was so jealous.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.640
I was 12...
and you were 11.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.360
And I wore my hair
exactly like this.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.880
They say if you want to put the romance
back in your marriage...

16:42.960 --> 16:45.880
I hate that expression. Like romance
is something misplaced,

16:45.960 --> 16:47.240
like an earring.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.600
I mean, all that stuff they tell you
to do... put rose petals on his pillow.

16:51.680 --> 16:54.960
I will. Let me just empty this
kitty litter off right with you.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.640
Wear satin panties,

16:56.720 --> 16:59.720
like my dry-cleaning bill
isn't frightening enough.

16:59.800 --> 17:02.560
Force your husband into a car

17:02.640 --> 17:04.680
and don't tell him
where you're going.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.000
I do that every other weekend.
It's called visiting my parents.

17:08.080 --> 17:09.000
(chuckles)

17:09.920 --> 17:11.920
Didn't Jane Seymour
write a book about that?

17:12.000 --> 17:13.680
Ah, yes,
and now she's divorced.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.520
Oh, but she's remarried.
She's that medicine woman.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.960
And is her hair long or short?

17:19.040 --> 17:22.680
She's got a new show, new husband,
and probably all new children.

17:23.760 --> 17:27.240
Listen... Andy and I have been
doing this thing.

17:27.320 --> 17:30.280
It's kind of embarrassing,
but it's really fun.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.080
And you get to be
with other people.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.920
And it really puts you
in the mood.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.080
Is it legal?

17:37.760 --> 17:40.960
The only catch is that
you have to wear heels.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.840
Ballroom dancing?

17:42.920 --> 17:46.320
Camille says it's a lot of fun.
Camille thinks Velcro's fun.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.120
Well, Velcro really is
pretty amazing, don't you think?

17:49.200 --> 17:50.920
Neil, pass the pasta.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.720
-What's the magic word?
-Pasta.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.200
No.
That's the magic carbohydrate.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.560
-What's the magic word?
-Neil.

17:58.360 --> 18:01.080
(Angela) <i>Neil is my father's</i>
<i>younger brother.</i>

18:01.160 --> 18:02.440
<i>He isn't married.</i>

18:02.520 --> 18:06.160
<i>Whenever he comes to dinner, my parents</i>
<i>give him all these leftovers to take home,</i>

18:06.240 --> 18:08.520
<i>like they don't have food</i>
<i>where he lives.</i>

18:08.600 --> 18:12.120
I know that ballroom dancing
isn't something we'd normally do...

18:12.200 --> 18:14.520
Sounds like something
no one would normally do.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.600
-It does. It sounds made up.
-Exactly what I was thinking.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.080
-Doesn't it?
-It's completely made up.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.600
There's no such thing.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.640
(chuckles)

18:25.680 --> 18:29.240
So I'm thinking of getting
my hair cut... short.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.200
-No, mom. Don't.
-We like it how it is.

18:32.280 --> 18:35.080
Mom just 'cause I changed my
hair, doesn’t mean you should.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.280
What do you think?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.480
Short... like, uh...
Hillary Clinton?

18:43.320 --> 18:44.320
Forget it.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.880
You know, Hillary Clinton's
a brilliant woman,

18:46.960 --> 18:49.320
and people should stop judging
her by her hair.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.520
Who's judging her?
I think she looks great.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.400
Don't you think Hillary Clinton
looks great?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.640
I think she should
wear more red.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.040
(laughs)

19:02.480 --> 19:04.040
It's over... me and Marla.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.240
There's still a connection. I mean,
we still see each other sometimes,

19:07.320 --> 19:10.320
and once in a while, you know,
we still have sex.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.520
-Sounds like my marriage.
-(door closes)

19:12.600 --> 19:14.520
-Just kidding.
-No. I screwed up.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.960
I don't... I just can't...

19:17.040 --> 19:20.800
Oh, boy.
I envy what you have with Patty.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.680
-Patty and I have our problems.
-Yeah, sure. You do?

19:24.320 --> 19:27.000
-You do?
-Well, I mean, it's only normal that...

19:27.080 --> 19:30.800
you know, things can't always be...
it's just not realistic.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.920
Not that I'm not...
you know, happy.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.440
Are you kidding me?

19:36.520 --> 19:38.160
You and Patty?
(laughs)

19:39.120 --> 19:41.560
You're the happiest couple
I know. No question.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.520
-I know.
-(door closes)

19:45.880 --> 19:47.360
(engine starts)

19:49.080 --> 19:51.800
Honey, no.
We've discussed this.

19:51.880 --> 19:52.880
It's a school night.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.400
Mom, I'll be right across
the street.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.280
(door closes)

19:56.360 --> 19:58.480
I think we should try
that ballroom dancing thing.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.920
Really?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.560
You really want to?
Because I don't want...

20:02.640 --> 20:03.680
I said I want to.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.120
Well... great.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.040
Mom... mom?

20:14.240 --> 20:16.800
Maybe Neil
can stay with Danielle...

20:17.680 --> 20:20.520
and Angela told Brian Krakow
that she would help him

20:20.600 --> 20:23.400
with some kind of science
experiment tomorrow night.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.120
Apparently there is
a mouse involved.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.560
Can't they bring
the mouse here?

20:28.720 --> 20:31.520
I don’t think she wants Danielle around,
from the look on her face.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.760
I think she has a crush...

20:33.840 --> 20:35.200
On Brian Krakow?

20:35.280 --> 20:36.800
She could do much worse.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.720
I like Brian, don't you?

20:39.960 --> 20:42.240
-Until a few seconds ago.
-(chuckles)

20:43.640 --> 20:44.800

20:46.280 --> 20:48.560

20:50.560 --> 20:52.880
(Danielle)
Mom, stop singing!

20:52.960 --> 20:55.080
I know. I'm not allowed to sing.

20:55.160 --> 20:57.920
I'm not allowed to dance.
Amish mom.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.680
Mom, can I go to Brian's,
yes or no?

21:01.400 --> 21:02.960
Just be back by 9:30.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.720
So, wait, um...

21:07.440 --> 21:10.040
seriously, should I...
cut my hair? I mean...

21:10.680 --> 21:12.200
pretend I'm not your mom.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.320
Mom...

21:14.360 --> 21:15.840
I can't pretend that.

21:28.560 --> 21:31.440
(Angela) <i>My So Called Life</i>
<i>will continue here on ABC...</i>

21:47.600 --> 21:53.040
Once again, an experiment can
be termed successful... if what?

21:53.880 --> 21:57.200
If the experiment
yields meaningful results.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.840
(Angela) <i>The thought that I might be</i>

22:58.240 --> 22:59.640
This clamp's coming loose.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.400
Um...

23:03.560 --> 23:07.520
uh, listen, Rayanne Graff and
Rickie Vasquez might be coming over...

23:08.520 --> 23:10.240
for a minute just to, um...

23:12.960 --> 23:14.040
bring me something.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.840
I knew you wouldn't
be much help.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.920
(jazz music playing)

23:44.080 --> 23:48.280
-Hi. I hope I'm not late.
-No. No. You're, uh... um...

23:49.760 --> 23:51.560
that's our instructor.
She just, uh...

23:53.280 --> 23:54.160
Hi.

23:55.440 --> 23:58.080
So...
what do you think?

23:59.960 --> 24:01.240
Yeah, well, it's short.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.560
-Yes, it is.
-It, uh... uh, shows your ears more.

24:07.000 --> 24:08.240
Mr. and Mrs. Chase?

24:09.600 --> 24:11.200
It's showtime.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.240

24:22.720 --> 24:24.040
-Whoa!
-(door closes)

24:25.400 --> 24:26.760
So, thanks. So...

24:26.840 --> 24:29.120
-Uh, so, Angela's got the money.
-Right.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.960
So... wait here.
We'll send her out.

24:32.040 --> 24:35.880
-I almost forgot, Tino...
-Yeah. Didn't he say that, uh...

24:35.960 --> 24:38.160
Yeah, see. I mentioned
you'd be dropping us.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.800
He said, "Tell Catalano
I'll meet him there.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.120
I got something
to tell him."

24:42.200 --> 24:44.320
About frozen embryos?

24:45.480 --> 24:46.560
What's that?

24:46.640 --> 24:49.800
Just...
this band we might form.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.400
-Yeah, I think...
-I think that was it.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.040
Quick. Quick.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.600
Slow. Slow.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
Quick.

25:02.760 --> 25:04.560
Okay. Your slows are too quick.

25:04.640 --> 25:06.760
Your quicks are too slow. Okay?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.000
Poor mouse.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.240
I hate just being
in an elevator.

25:15.320 --> 25:16.920
-Angela...
-Wait.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.080
I have to talk to you.

25:21.040 --> 25:25.520
Look, I know this is your house and all,
but... could you leave for a second?

25:26.560 --> 25:28.200
So you admit it's my house.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.280
That's really...
'cause I was wondering.

25:30.360 --> 25:34.560
-No, she's not saying to...
-I'm not saying leave the house.

25:34.640 --> 25:38.000
-Just leave the kitchen.
-Just come here for a second.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.760
I'm really sorry.
This won't take long.

25:40.840 --> 25:41.680
(scoffs)

25:51.360 --> 25:54.120
And back, back, back.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.000
Slide together.
Okay, Patty, let him steer you,

25:57.080 --> 25:59.040
'cause he's the one
going forward.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.720
Well, when do I get
to go forward?

26:00.800 --> 26:04.320
Well, see, um, it is the man who
goes forward most frequently.

26:04.400 --> 26:05.280
(laughs)

26:05.360 --> 26:06.520
Tell me about it.

26:07.320 --> 26:11.240
Well, wh... do you have any idea
how hard it is to do this backwards?

26:18.840 --> 26:22.200
Believe me. They had their free
introductory class once, too.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.320
Listen...

26:23.400 --> 26:26.360
a lot of times couples think they're going
to automatically dance like that,

26:26.440 --> 26:28.840
but it's not quite that simple.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.920
Okay?

26:30.000 --> 26:33.840
And... 1... back. Good.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.360
Let's go. 1, 2...

26:40.760 --> 26:43.680
-She's not saying that she...
-I'm not saying...

26:43.760 --> 26:45.960
See, there's thinking
about him, right?

26:46.040 --> 26:48.400
Which is what I do
all the time, like...

26:49.160 --> 26:50.560
like this...

26:50.640 --> 26:51.760
Obsession.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.840
-Right, so?
-So... it keeps me going or something,

26:55.920 --> 26:58.720
like I need it
just to get through the day.

26:59.600 --> 27:02.480
It's just...
it's an obsession.

27:03.080 --> 27:07.040
Right, and if you make it real,
it's not the same.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.080
It's not...
it's not yours anymore.

27:10.880 --> 27:14.960
I don't know. Maybe I'd rather
have a fantasy... than even him.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.920
I completely understand this.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.280
I totally
and completely disagree.

27:21.160 --> 27:25.240
You want Jordan Catalano
in actuality because...

27:27.200 --> 27:29.880
there is no because.
You just want him.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.000
Only you're programmed
to never admit it.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.000
That does have
the ring of truth.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.440
(mellow music playing)

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
Okay.

27:51.600 --> 27:55.400
So here's your free evaluation,
which is... easy,

27:55.480 --> 27:59.640
'cause you both sort of have the
same problem... uh, which is rushing...

28:00.160 --> 28:01.440
like ahead of the music.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.880
Um, I would strongly recommend
group classes.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.680
You should be dancing
with other people.

28:08.760 --> 28:13.040
What? Why? I don't want to dance
with anybody else. I mean, do you?

28:13.120 --> 28:16.120
I thought the whole point was
to do something together.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.520
-Maybe it helps.
-I mean, maybe...

28:18.600 --> 28:19.400
(scoffs)

28:19.480 --> 28:23.200
See, he won't admit it, but he's dying
to dance with other people.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.000
Hey, this was your idea.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.560
I didn't want to dance
with anybody.

28:27.240 --> 28:29.000
Okay. This isn't easy.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.760
There are many different parts of this,
that have to come together.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.960
Like the rhythm.

28:36.760 --> 28:37.880
Not too fast.

28:38.560 --> 28:39.720
Not too slow.

28:40.560 --> 28:44.280
The confidence...
to make the steps your own.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.800
(dance instructor) Lots of people,
they try so hard.

28:50.880 --> 28:52.520
They can't hear the music.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.640
Then...

28:57.720 --> 28:59.800
they start to feel lost.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.560
So they want to look down.

29:03.440 --> 29:04.640
Don't look down.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.640
It will throw you off balance.

29:08.720 --> 29:10.200
And you'll lose your footing.

29:12.480 --> 29:14.560
So look straight ahead.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.360
Look right into
your partner's eyes...

29:21.200 --> 29:22.960
and remember to smile.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.960
Hi.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.720
So, I have the money.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.400
So...
you have my I.D., right?

29:52.480 --> 29:53.640
Yeah.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.480
So this is your car?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.200
Get in.

30:04.360 --> 30:05.480
(scoffs)

30:07.200 --> 30:10.240
I can't... go anywhere.

30:10.320 --> 30:12.360
I mean, I... I should stay here.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.840
(chuckles)
Uh... it's a long story.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.200
I didn't say go anywhere.

30:20.280 --> 30:21.760
Oh, okay.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.080
(door opens)

30:28.360 --> 30:29.840
All right.
So what's it called again?

30:30.920 --> 30:32.760
-A volvo...
-A volumeter.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.760
-And what's it do again?
-Measures pressure.

30:35.840 --> 30:38.640
Yeah, but like what? Air pressure?
There's a lot of pressures.

30:38.720 --> 30:40.200
Acupressure,
emotional pressure.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.520
Like the mouse itself
must be under pressure.

30:42.600 --> 30:45.600
That would be cool for an experiment.
Figure out the mouse itself,

30:45.680 --> 30:47.680
like what goes through
it's mind.

30:47.760 --> 30:50.360
-Was it hard to get it in there?
-Shut up!

30:53.320 --> 30:55.080
Just... shut up.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.960
It was just a joke.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.400
You should measure
your own pressure.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.960
So... the mouse makes pressure...
just by breathing?

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Yes.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.080
I can relate.
But why are you, I mean...

31:13.000 --> 31:14.640
what is the point?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.000
It proves...

31:20.000 --> 31:22.480
um, it's a system
that's been devised

31:22.560 --> 31:24.840
and there are certain
scientific principles that...

31:28.600 --> 31:29.800
It's for extra credit.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.280
(Angela)
<i>What's amazing...</i>

31:34.640 --> 31:37.640
<i>is when you can feel your life</i>
<i>going somewhere...</i>

31:38.200 --> 31:41.120
<i>like your life just figured out</i>
<i>how to get good...</i>

31:42.160 --> 31:43.640
<i>like that second.</i>

32:00.520 --> 32:02.800
Wow. It looks real.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.600
-Uh, why is...
-Mmm! Hey.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.000
I'm s...

32:09.680 --> 32:11.200
-I'm sorry. I just...
-No.

32:11.280 --> 32:12.280
I was...

32:13.480 --> 32:15.040
-I was talking.
-No.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.360
Whatever.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.720
-So how come...
-Mmm!

32:24.640 --> 32:25.800
Quit it!

32:29.200 --> 32:30.920
I mean, you have
to work up to that.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.960
I don't open that wide
at the dentist.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.320
How old are you?

32:40.680 --> 32:42.040
I don't believe this.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.240
What is your point?

32:47.200 --> 32:48.200
15.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.720
You act younger.

32:50.800 --> 32:55.320
First of all, you don't know me
well enough to say how old I seem.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.040
-And second...
-You talk a lot.

32:59.360 --> 33:02.880
I've said, like, eight sentences
to you my entire life.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.400
(exhales)

33:11.960 --> 33:14.680
This whole day
has been one long...

33:16.480 --> 33:18.080
thing that makes no sense.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.600
(Angela)
<i>We both stopped talking.</i>

33:21.360 --> 33:24.280
<i>Part of his sleeve</i>
<i>was touching my arm.</i>

33:24.360 --> 33:25.680
<i>I don't know if he knew.</i>

33:26.920 --> 33:30.560
<i>Then everything started to seem</i>
<i>perfect for some reason.</i>

33:31.960 --> 33:34.320
<i>The feel of his shirt</i>
<i>against my elbow,</i>

33:34.400 --> 33:36.320
<i>the fact that I still</i>
<i>had an elbow.</i>

33:36.960 --> 33:43.400
<i>It was the perfect moment for him</i>
<i>to kiss me... for him to anything me.</i>

33:49.720 --> 33:51.640
-(door opens)
-Well, I got to go.

33:51.720 --> 33:52.760
So...

33:54.960 --> 33:55.800
later.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.080
(door closes)

34:04.160 --> 34:05.800
(car engine starts)

34:08.960 --> 34:11.640
(Angela)
<i>I could have killed him.</i>

34:12.840 --> 34:16.440
You're back so early?
Angela's not even due home yet.

34:16.520 --> 34:18.400
I think Danielle's asleep.

34:18.480 --> 34:20.120
Whoa.
What did you do to your hair?

34:27.800 --> 34:30.000
Boy, Patty can be
really touchy sometimes.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.960
I didn't say
that I didn't like it.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.560
All I... anyway, I don't...
you know, it'll grow back in.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.640
-Not in our lifetime.
-Neil. Neil.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.280
I, uh...

34:44.360 --> 34:45.760
I met this girl.

34:46.720 --> 34:47.880
What?

34:48.680 --> 34:49.680
What?

34:51.200 --> 34:52.520
Well, I'm not surprised.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.800
-How can you say that?
-I don't know. I just...

34:54.880 --> 34:56.160
I didn't mean to meet her.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.560
I was doing some printing
for her, and we started...

34:59.560 --> 35:02.320
you know... getting into these
long conversations

35:02.400 --> 35:04.280
you know,
the kind where you, uh...

35:05.720 --> 35:07.960
look up and you're surprised
to see other people...

35:08.040 --> 35:09.280
You're burning your butter.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.720
One day out of nowhere,
she grabs my tie.

35:13.800 --> 35:18.760
She says, "I hate you,
I can't sleep 'cause of you."

35:19.400 --> 35:22.120
She starts saying these
unbelievable things.

35:22.200 --> 35:25.400
-She was actually holding on to your tie?
-The point is...

35:26.640 --> 35:29.480
we haven't really
done anything but talk.

35:30.720 --> 35:32.560
-But...
-You can't do this to me.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.000
-If you and Patty get divorced...
-Shut up!

35:37.000 --> 35:39.240
-No one's getting a divorce.
-Where am I going to go?

35:39.320 --> 35:42.160
I mean, like... on holidays?

35:46.920 --> 35:50.320
I was supposed to meet her at
this motel tomorrow afternoon.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.520
(chuckles)
God, man, that's such a cliché.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.280
You know, clichés happen.

36:02.280 --> 36:04.000
-Talk me out of it.
-Don't do it.

36:08.720 --> 36:09.960
Well, don't.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.520
Look at you.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.920
I mean, you haven't really done
anything really wrong yet

36:17.000 --> 36:19.080
and already you're acting weird.

36:19.920 --> 36:20.920
I m...

36:21.680 --> 36:22.760
you went dancing.

36:25.080 --> 36:25.880
I know.

36:28.560 --> 36:30.080
(door opens)

36:43.640 --> 36:44.560
(door closes)

36:58.840 --> 37:00.160
Uh, hey.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.480
Where's, uh...

37:03.160 --> 37:04.560
I mean, is Tino here?

37:05.760 --> 37:08.080
That's, uh...
I mean, that's Angela's.

37:10.400 --> 37:13.440
Uh, shouldn't it prove
that she's 21?

37:14.880 --> 37:16.040
So?

37:16.120 --> 37:18.320
So according to this,
she was born yesterday.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.040
Why are you here?

37:24.560 --> 37:25.600
I live here.

37:26.960 --> 37:30.160
Is she really from, uh, France?

37:31.800 --> 37:33.360
Never mind.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.400
Just... just make sure
she gets that, okay?

37:35.480 --> 37:37.000
Sure.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.320
(rock music playing)

37:49.920 --> 37:51.080
Can I say something?

37:52.160 --> 37:54.920
I don't think this was
such a terrible evening.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.280
-I never said it was.
-You're sitting there thinking that I...

37:57.360 --> 37:59.200
-You don't know what I'm thinking.
-Oh, shut up.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.880
-How could you say that about my hair?
-What did I say?

38:04.960 --> 38:07.200
-That it shows my ears more.
-It does.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.960
What kind of a thing
it is to say,

38:09.040 --> 38:11.600
you think I felt like tangoing
with you after that?

38:14.200 --> 38:15.440
I didn't know what to say.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.320
All of a sudden,
there's all this pressure to,

38:18.400 --> 38:23.760
you know, uh... uh... compliment
you... and... and... lead.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.440
There's something wrong here.
Am I right?

38:28.120 --> 38:30.480
We're drifting apart from seeing
each other too much.

38:30.560 --> 38:33.720
We've become like furniture
to each other or something.

38:33.800 --> 38:36.080
Have we become incompatible?
Because...

38:36.640 --> 38:39.640
we are terrible...
I mean, we're terrible dancers.

38:39.720 --> 38:43.080
-So what?
-How can we have been together so long

38:43.160 --> 38:44.640
and not be able
to dance together?

38:44.720 --> 38:48.400
Because! Because we have been
together for so long.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.360
-(groans)
-(glass breaks)

39:17.280 --> 39:20.160
(kisses)

39:25.400 --> 39:26.440
Dance with me.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.400
But we don't know how.

39:33.760 --> 39:34.680
We know how.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.040
(kisses)

39:43.840 --> 39:47.280
(door opens and closes)

40:03.200 --> 40:05.280
I'm not going to take
the extra credit.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.000
Whatever.

40:09.320 --> 40:10.360
(chuckles)

40:14.160 --> 40:15.320
You forgot this.

40:27.600 --> 40:31.000
Why did our generation
always dance so far apart?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.040
-Too rebellious, I guess.
-Hmm.

40:36.040 --> 40:39.000
Even when we danced close,
there were no...

40:39.080 --> 40:41.000
Right. No steps or anything.

40:41.800 --> 40:42.800
Just...

40:43.640 --> 40:44.680
made it all up.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.200
Never took the time to learn...

40:50.640 --> 40:52.440
the real steps.

41:02.600 --> 41:03.680
(exhales)

41:07.720 --> 41:11.760
(door opens and closes)

41:24.400 --> 41:25.480
Thought I heard someone.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.320
So, your mom and I went dancing.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.000
It's hard.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.880
-It's harder than it sounds.
-Dad, I don't feel like talking.

41:34.960 --> 41:35.760
No offense.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.360
Oh, I don't feel like talking,
certainly not to you.

41:41.000 --> 41:42.480
Want me to warm up
that spaghetti?

41:53.320 --> 41:56.440
(Angela) <i>I have to say, when my father</i>
<i>warms something up...</i>

41:57.440 --> 41:59.640
<i>it tastes better than</i>
<i>when anyone else does.</i>

42:00.640 --> 42:02.880
So how did your experiment
go with Brian?

42:02.960 --> 42:04.440
He did most of it.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
So is this...

42:07.200 --> 42:09.120
-like a date?
-Dad.

42:10.520 --> 42:13.200
It's...
they're not...

42:15.840 --> 42:17.280
people just hang out.

42:17.360 --> 42:19.160
They're not... it's not dates.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.360
There's people...

42:22.240 --> 42:23.240
together...

42:24.080 --> 42:25.200
in a bunch.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.040
Hmm.

42:31.000 --> 42:33.440
So, was there
someone else there...

42:35.040 --> 42:36.080
you like?

42:36.160 --> 42:40.720
(Angela) <i>It's so strange how parents can</i>
<i>out of nowhere turn psychic.</i>

42:40.800 --> 42:41.960
<i>It's unnerving.</i>

42:42.880 --> 42:44.080
It's okay to like someone...

42:44.920 --> 42:45.960
but, I mean...

42:46.640 --> 42:50.560
-boys your age can sometimes...
-Dad, I know.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.080
Can sometimes what?

42:58.360 --> 43:01.760
Can sometimes...
mmm, not know how to be...

43:02.240 --> 43:03.560
what you want them to be.

43:05.840 --> 43:06.880
My point is that...

43:10.920 --> 43:14.360
it's really... hard to figure
out how to be a man.

43:18.280 --> 43:20.520
Practically, every man I know
is still working on it.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.440
So that's what we're doing...
we're eating.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.120
Really shows
my ears more, huh?

43:32.640 --> 43:33.920
It's time for bed, you two.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.040
Uh, you two go ahead.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.160
I'll clean up.

44:07.160 --> 44:09.440
It's me.
Uh, listen...

44:11.440 --> 44:13.880
I can't do this.
(nervously chuckles)

44:14.640 --> 44:17.520
I know I acted like I could,
but I can't.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.000
Uh, you must think
that I'm an idiot,

44:20.080 --> 44:21.800
and maybe I am, but, uh...

44:22.600 --> 44:24.880
uh,
it's not going to happen, uh...

44:26.960 --> 44:28.400
because it can't.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.800
Because... oh, there's
so many reasons why. I mean...

44:32.480 --> 44:34.800
look, I can't really talk,
except...

44:35.520 --> 44:38.760
No, this is not you.
This is not your fault.

44:38.840 --> 44:39.880
It's me.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.800
I'm sorry. I just can't.

44:45.400 --> 44:46.480
I'm sorry.

44:52.920 --> 44:55.800
You're going to have a hard time
getting up in the morning.

44:55.880 --> 44:57.640
(dramatic music playing)

45:23.880 --> 45:26.000
(theme music playing)
