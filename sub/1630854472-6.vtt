WEBVTT

00:02.380 --> 00:03.802
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT MY FUTURE LATELY,

00:03.902 --> 00:05.724
AND I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO FOCUS

00:05.824 --> 00:09.287
ON NEW CHALLENGES,
SO, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY,

00:09.387 --> 00:12.291
I'VE RESIGNED MY POSITION
AS HEAD COACH AT GAU.

00:12.391 --> 00:14.733
GOD, GARRETT LEGIT
SCOOPED ME.

00:14.833 --> 00:16.695
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

00:16.795 --> 00:19.138
SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS,
BABY GIRL.

00:19.238 --> 00:21.140
[PEOPLE MURMURING]

00:21.240 --> 00:23.222
OK, WELL, I KNOW
THAT IT HAPPENS, DAD,

00:23.322 --> 00:25.345
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

00:25.445 --> 00:27.387
HE DESERVES TO PAY AND NOT
GET OFF SCOT-FREE.
BILLY: I KNOW.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.389
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHAT THE HELL
IS HAPPENING?

00:29.489 --> 00:31.471
HOW IS THE
PRESS CONFERENCE
OVER ALREADY?

00:31.571 --> 00:33.634
BILLY: GARRETT JUST RESIGNED.
JORDAN: WHAT?

00:33.734 --> 00:35.315
BILLY: YEAH.
JORDAN: IT'S NATIONAL
SIGNING DAY.

00:35.415 --> 00:37.037
SPENCER: DID HE SAY
WHY HE'S RESIGNING?
OLIVIA: NOT A DAMN PEEP,

00:37.137 --> 00:39.560
AND NOW HE JUST GETS
TO LEAVE ON HIS OWN TERMS.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.562
OK, LOOK, I'M GONNA GO
CATCH UP WITH A.D. BARNES,

00:41.662 --> 00:43.564
SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING DOWN.
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE OK.

00:43.664 --> 00:45.807
NO, IT WON'T, DAD,
BECAUSE HE INJURED PLAYERS

00:45.907 --> 00:48.089
AND NOW HE'S DRIVING
THE NARRATIVE.

00:48.189 --> 00:50.131
OK, LOOK, GARRETT IS
OFF THE TEAM, RIGHT,
WHICH MEANS HE CAN'T

00:50.231 --> 00:51.773
INJURE OR DESTROY
ANY MORE PLAYERS' LIVES.

00:51.873 --> 00:53.615
NOW, ISN'T--
ISN'T THAT THE WIN?

00:53.715 --> 00:55.777
IT IS,
BUT WE SHOULD TABLE

00:55.877 --> 00:57.900
THIS CONVERSATION
FOR ANOTHER TIME, OK?

00:58.000 --> 01:00.783
J. AND I GOTTA GO
FIND OUR TEAMMATES.
BILLY: ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.

01:00.883 --> 01:03.586
SPENCER: I'LL HOLLA AT YOU.
BILLY: I'M GONNA GO CATCH UP
WITH BARNES. YOU GOOD?

01:03.686 --> 01:05.748
- SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO, JUST SIT TIGHT?
- YES.

01:05.848 --> 01:09.052
JUST CHILL.
I'M GONNA GET
INTEL, ALL RIGHT?

01:10.573 --> 01:12.155
KENNY: HEY, I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN.

01:12.255 --> 01:13.797
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
OR PLACE FOR THAT--

01:13.897 --> 01:15.158
THE HELL IT AIN'T!

01:15.258 --> 01:16.760
TODAY IS NATIONAL
SIGNING DAY,

01:16.860 --> 01:18.682
THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY
OF THE YEAR!

01:18.782 --> 01:20.124
I GOTTA TELL
THESE KIDS SOMETHING.

01:20.224 --> 01:21.485
YOU MADE A COMMITMENT
TO THEM.

01:21.585 --> 01:23.127
AND I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO THIS SCHOOL.

01:23.227 --> 01:25.049
THE HELL IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

01:25.149 --> 01:26.891
GARRETT.

01:26.991 --> 01:29.213
[SIGHS]

01:29.313 --> 01:31.536
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,
KENNY,

01:31.636 --> 01:33.538
ONE OF THE BEST
I'VE BEEN AROUND.

01:33.638 --> 01:35.300
JUST KNOW
THAT EVERYTHING I DID,

01:35.400 --> 01:38.123
I DID FOR THE GREATER GOOD
OF THIS PROGRAM.

01:45.170 --> 01:47.033
OLIVIA:
SO WHO TIPPED YOU?

01:47.133 --> 01:49.355
I'M OFFICIALLY
OFF THE TEAM.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

01:49.455 --> 01:50.997
NO.
NOTHING'S THAT EASY,

01:51.097 --> 01:52.839
NOT FOR SOMEBODY
LIKE YOU.

01:52.939 --> 01:54.401
IT WAS EITHER I LEAVE

01:54.501 --> 01:56.403
OR GET OUTED.
I CHOSE THE FORMER.

01:56.503 --> 01:58.805
EVERYBODY WINS,
EVEN YOU.

01:58.905 --> 02:00.807
ACTUALLY,
THE REAL WIN WILL COME

02:00.907 --> 02:03.891
WHEN I DROP THIS ARTICLE
AND THE WORLD FINDS OUT
WHAT YOU DID.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.853
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S STILL COMIN' OUT.

02:05.953 --> 02:07.855
WORD OF ADVICE:
GIVE YOURSELF A PAT

02:07.955 --> 02:10.057
ON THE BACK AND MOVE ON.
IF YOU DO RELEASE

02:10.157 --> 02:12.500
THAT ARTICLE,
IT WON'T JUST DESTROY
THE FOOTBALL PROGRAM,

02:12.600 --> 02:15.503
IT'LL ALSO SCREW UP
JORDAN AND SPENCER'S
CAREERS,

02:15.603 --> 02:18.646
AND I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

02:30.339 --> 02:32.842
BILLY: HEH HEH HEH!
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

02:32.942 --> 02:34.844
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR MEETING WITH ME, MAN.

02:34.944 --> 02:36.526
- OH, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
- APPRECIATE THAT.

02:36.626 --> 02:38.128
AND I APOLOGIZE
FOR ALL OF THE CHAOS.

02:38.228 --> 02:39.729
IT'S JUST CRAZY.

02:39.829 --> 02:41.371
- OH, NO--NO PROBLEM. I'M GOOD.
- WATER?

02:41.471 --> 02:43.573
YES, PLEASE.
UM, I MEAN, EVEN

02:43.673 --> 02:45.856
TO THIS DAY,
MY POPS WILL NOT SHUT UP

02:45.956 --> 02:49.219
ABOUT SOUTH CRENSHAW'S
FINEST, THE RICK BARNES.

02:49.319 --> 02:51.422
- AW, MAN, COME ON.
- AND NOBODY'LL EVER FORGET

02:51.522 --> 02:53.544
THE RUNNING BACK THAT TOOK
THE TEAM TO STATE

02:53.644 --> 02:55.546
AFTER THAT
NEAR-DECADE DROUGHT.

02:55.646 --> 02:57.789
YEAH, BUT THEN YOU
COME ALONG, RIGHT,
A FEW YEARS LATER

02:57.889 --> 02:59.430
AND YOU BREAK ALL
MY RECORDS.

02:59.530 --> 03:01.433
[BOTH LAUGH]

03:01.533 --> 03:04.075
BILLY: AH!
BARNES: SO, UH, WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU, BILLY?

03:04.175 --> 03:06.718
I'M SORRY. WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON HERE, I
NEED TO MAKE THIS QUICK.

03:06.818 --> 03:09.361
HONESTLY, I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU FOR TAKING
SUCH GOOD CARE

03:09.461 --> 03:11.403
OF MY BOYS THIS SEASON.
BARNES: OH, YEAH, MM-HMM.

03:11.503 --> 03:14.567
BUT THEN THE GARRETT NEWS
BROKE, SO IF YOU DON'T
MIND ME ASKING,

03:14.667 --> 03:17.089
HOW DID ALL THIS GO DOWN?
BARNES: YEAH, WELL,

03:17.189 --> 03:19.732
FRIEND OF MINE
AT THE NCAA HAD HEARD

03:19.832 --> 03:21.895
SOME RUMBLINGS
ABOUT GARRETT, SO

03:21.995 --> 03:24.978
I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF
TO GET OUT IN FRONT
OF ALL THIS DRAMA

03:25.078 --> 03:26.620
BY SELF-PENALISING.
BILLY: SMART.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.422
AND AS FAR AS GARRETT
IS CONCERNED,

03:28.522 --> 03:30.384
WE GAVE HIM
A GENEROUS PACKAGE,

03:30.484 --> 03:32.146
PLUS HE'S GONNA TAKE
A YEAR OFF OF
COACHING TO, UH,

03:32.246 --> 03:34.148
SPEND SOME MORE TIME
WITH HIS FAMILY.

03:34.248 --> 03:37.231
OK. THAT'S, UH,
I GUESS THAT'S REASONABLE.

03:37.331 --> 03:39.914
LOOK, I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE MY BOYS
ARE--ARE TAKEN CARE OF.

03:40.014 --> 03:41.916
OH, OH, WE ARE GONNA
MAKE SURE OF THAT.

03:42.016 --> 03:44.599
HEH HEH! AND LOOK,
YOU NEED TO BE PROUD
OF YOURSELF.

03:44.699 --> 03:46.601
YEAH, WAY YOU COACHED
THOSE BOYS?

03:46.701 --> 03:48.804
WHEW!
SPENCER AND JORDAN,
THEY ARE PILLARS

03:48.904 --> 03:51.006
OF THIS PROGRAM.
THEY GOT VERY
BRIGHT FUTURES.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.248
AH, THANK YOU.
I JUST--I PLAYED
A SMALL PART.

03:53.348 --> 03:55.931
THEY DO ALL THE WORK--
BARNES: AND SPEAKING OF
PLAYING A PART,

03:56.031 --> 03:59.335
I UNDERSTAND
YOUR DAUGHTER IS PURSUING
A STORY ON GARRETT.

03:59.435 --> 04:01.818
- YES, SHE IS.
- HEH HEH HEH!

04:01.918 --> 04:04.020
LOOK AT YOU.
BREAKING MY RECORDS,
NOW YOU GOT NOT ONE,

04:04.120 --> 04:06.182
BUT TWO SMART KIDS.
[BOTH LAUGH]

04:06.282 --> 04:08.144
I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT.

04:08.244 --> 04:10.787
WELL, NOW THAT
GARRETT'S RESIGNED
AND THE, UH, NCAA's

04:10.887 --> 04:12.950
INVOLVED, I'M ASSUMING
ALL THAT STUFF
IS GOING AWAY.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.512
SO, LISTEN, HEY, IT
WAS, UH, GOOD SEEING
YOU TODAY, BILLY.

04:15.612 --> 04:17.955
- OK, NO, ABSOLUTELY, UH-HUH.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU EVER
NEED ANYTHING,

04:18.055 --> 04:20.478
LET ME KNOW,
SHOOT ME A TEXT,
WHATEVER. I GOT YOU.

04:20.578 --> 04:22.159
- THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MAN.
- ANYTIME.

04:22.259 --> 04:24.262
GOOD SEEING YOU.
BILLY: YES, SIR.

04:25.663 --> 04:28.166
SPENCER: COACH...

04:28.266 --> 04:31.409
WE FIGURED YOU AIN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT BREAKFAST.
HOW YOU HOLDIN' UP?

04:31.509 --> 04:33.051
SHOULDN'T I BE ASKING
Y'ALL THAT?

04:33.151 --> 04:35.053
WE BEAT YOU TO IT.

04:35.153 --> 04:37.155
APPRECIATE IT.

04:39.598 --> 04:41.861
WHY DON'T Y'ALL LOOK
SURPRISED ABOUT TODAY?

04:41.961 --> 04:43.983
IT'S COMPLICATED.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.666
WELL, UNCOMPLICATE IT
FOR ME BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,

04:46.766 --> 04:48.788
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A JOB.
JORDAN: WHAT?

04:48.888 --> 04:51.711
OF COURSE YOU DO, COACH.
KENNY: I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
NOBODY'S TALKING.

04:51.811 --> 04:54.514
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A REASON I'M STILL
IN THE DARK.

04:54.614 --> 04:57.517
SO WHAT'S UP?

04:57.617 --> 04:59.560
HEY, HEY,

04:59.660 --> 05:02.102
THIS IS MY JOB I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

05:04.625 --> 05:07.548
ONE OF Y'ALL
START TALKIN'.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.213
'MORNING, COACH.

05:12.313 --> 05:14.856
ADAMS! MY MAN!
UH, DON'T MIND
THE MESS.

05:14.956 --> 05:16.858
I, UH, I PULLED
AN ALL-NIGHTER.

05:16.958 --> 05:19.181
ASHER: ANGRY HIPPO?
MONTES: MMM!
CHOCOLATE PINEAPPLE,

05:19.281 --> 05:21.944
TWO FLAVOURS I NORMALLY
WOULDN'T CONSIDER GOING
GOOD TOGETHER, BUT, WOW,

05:22.044 --> 05:24.547
THIS ENERGY DRINK WILL
CARBONATE YOUR SOUL.
WANT ONE?

05:24.647 --> 05:26.749
- UH--
- COME ON.
YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.

05:26.849 --> 05:28.911
NO, NO, NO.
THAT'LL BE A HARD--PASS.

05:29.011 --> 05:30.713
OK. THANK YOU.

05:30.813 --> 05:32.715
WHY THE ALL-NIGHTER?

05:32.815 --> 05:34.637
BECAUSE IT'S
FLIPPING SEASON,
HERMANO.

05:34.737 --> 05:36.519
IT'S TIME TO GO
AFTER SOME RECRUITS.

05:36.619 --> 05:39.122
WE ALREADY HAVE
22 COMMITMENTS SIGNED
AND READY TO GO.

05:39.222 --> 05:41.124
YEAH, THE MAX
WE COULD SIGN IS 25.

05:41.224 --> 05:43.447
THAT GIVES US
3 MORE SLOTS TO FILL,

05:43.547 --> 05:46.650
AND I'VE GOT
A FEW IN MIND.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.894
- JORDAN BAKER
AND SPENCER JAMES?
- YEP.

05:49.994 --> 05:52.256
TELL ME YOU AREN'T THINKING
WHAT I THINK YOU ARE.

05:52.356 --> 05:55.860
GARRETT RESIGNING
MEANS FOR AN UNCERTAIN
FOOTBALL PROGRAM FOR GAU.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.905
TRANSLATION--
ANYONE CAN BE FLIPPED,
RECRUIT OR ACTIVE PLAYER,

06:00.005 --> 06:02.387
AND YOU'VE GOT
AN ADVANTAGE, LIVING
WITH THE TWO STARS.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.830
LOOK, COACH, I--I DON'T
WANT TO PRESSURE THEM.

06:04.930 --> 06:07.232
I'M SURE THEIR HEADS ARE
STILL SPINNING RIGHT NOW.

06:07.332 --> 06:09.435
IF THEY WANT
TO LAND AT COASTAL,
I'LL BE THE FIRST

06:09.535 --> 06:12.118
TO SIGN THEM,
BUT THEY GOTTA MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

06:12.218 --> 06:13.840
FAIR ENOUGH.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.682
THESE OTHER GUYS,
THOUGH, I'M--I'M GAME.

06:15.782 --> 06:17.804
GOOD. START
WITH MARCO GALVEZ,

06:17.904 --> 06:20.407
5-STAR TAILBACK
AND TALENT IN SPADES.

06:20.507 --> 06:23.090
- OK.
- GO MAKE SOME DREAMS
COME TRUE, ADAMS.

06:23.190 --> 06:25.132
NOTHING SHORT
OF THAT. COPY?

06:25.232 --> 06:27.334
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

06:27.434 --> 06:28.936
WAIT. ISAIAH?

06:29.036 --> 06:30.978
HE'S IN
MY POSITION GROUP.

06:31.078 --> 06:32.820
WELL, HE FIT GARRETT'S
JANKY-ASS PROFILE:

06:32.920 --> 06:35.022
A WALK-ON, NO SCHOLARSHIP,
DESPERATE FOR MONEY.

06:35.122 --> 06:37.025
WE WERE PLANNING
ON TELLING YOU
AFTER SIGNING DAY,

06:37.125 --> 06:38.786
BUT TODAY JUST
MESSED ALL THAT UP.

06:38.886 --> 06:40.428
YEAH, BUT WE HERE NOW
AND WE WANT TO HELP,

06:40.528 --> 06:42.430
AND THAT STARTS WITH
CONVINCING OUR 20 RECRUITS

06:42.530 --> 06:44.473
TO STAY WITH US AND SIGN
THEIR LETTERS OF INTENT,

06:44.573 --> 06:46.755
INCLUDING THAT BIG FISH,
MARCO GALVEZ.

06:46.855 --> 06:48.877
RIGHT. YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TALK TO JESUS
ABOUT THAT ONE.

06:48.977 --> 06:51.160
AIN'T NO WAY
THOSE GUYS ARE
COMMITTING TO US,

06:51.260 --> 06:52.802
ESPECIALLY MARCO.

06:52.902 --> 06:54.643
OUR PROGRAM IS
TOO UNSTABLE.

06:54.743 --> 06:57.326
JORDAN: SO WE SELL YOU TO THEM.
KENNY: ME?

06:57.426 --> 06:58.888
YEAH.

06:58.988 --> 07:01.010
YOU, THE PLAYERS' COACH

07:01.110 --> 07:03.333
WHO'S THE TRUE HEART
OF THIS PROGRAM? YOU.

07:03.433 --> 07:05.015
[SCOFFS]

07:05.115 --> 07:07.237
OH, MAN.

07:08.598 --> 07:10.761
[SIGHS]

07:12.322 --> 07:14.265
IF I DECIDE
TO ACCEPT THIS OFFER,

07:14.365 --> 07:16.227
AND THAT'S A BIG IF,

07:16.327 --> 07:18.469
I'M ONLY GIVING YOU
4 PLAYERS EACH.

07:18.569 --> 07:21.192
OK, AS LONG AS MARCO GALVEZ
IS ONE OF MY 4.

07:21.292 --> 07:23.034
- NAW, NAW, HE'S MINE.
- COACH, COME ON. I CAN--

07:23.134 --> 07:25.036
SERIOUS, SPENCE?
I'M RISKING A LOT

07:25.136 --> 07:27.359
BY HAVING YOU GUYS
HELP ME OUT.

07:27.459 --> 07:30.402
JORDAN: BUT WE ARE HELPING YOU?
KENNY: HEH!

07:30.502 --> 07:32.044
YEAH, J.,
YOU'RE HELPING ME.

07:32.144 --> 07:34.486
HEH! BUT LISTEN,

07:34.586 --> 07:36.488
Y'ALL GOT
TO STAY TAPPED IN
WITH ME 24/7.

07:36.588 --> 07:38.531
IF ANYTHING
GOES DOWN, I NEED
TO KNOW, RIGHT?

07:38.631 --> 07:40.613
SPENCER: BET.
JORDAN: YES, SIR.

07:40.713 --> 07:42.495
WHAT DO WE DO IF PEOPLE
ASK ABOUT GARRETT?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.537
YOU TELL 'EM GAU IS
FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE.

07:44.637 --> 07:47.640
GARRETT...
IS IN THE PAST.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.354
[GRUNTS]

08:00.454 --> 08:03.558
AND HERE I THOUGHT
GIRLFRIENDS DIDN'T
GET GHOSTED.

08:03.658 --> 08:05.600
[CHUCKLES]
MORE LIKE I DIDN'T
WANT TO WAKE YOU

08:05.700 --> 08:07.802
FROM YOUR LATE-MORNING
SLUMBER, MILADY.

08:07.902 --> 08:10.405
MM-HMM.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
YOU HAD ME UP

08:10.505 --> 08:12.888
BINGEING OLD EPISODES
OF "BONES." [SIGHS]

08:12.988 --> 08:15.450
HOW ARE YOU EVEN
ALIVE RIGHT NOW?

08:15.550 --> 08:19.054
[SIGHS]
GUESS WAKING UP TO
YOUR BEAUTY INSPIRES ME.

08:19.154 --> 08:20.896
IT'S FLIPPING SEASON,
ISN'T IT?

08:20.996 --> 08:22.818
WAIT. HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT FLIPPING SEASON?

08:22.918 --> 08:24.740
[GIGGLES]
YOUR BOSS JUST TWEETED,

08:24.840 --> 08:26.302
SO I'M TAKING THIS
MIGHT APPLY TO YOU.

08:26.402 --> 08:28.625
