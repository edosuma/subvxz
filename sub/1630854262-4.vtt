"Bachelor in Paradise"...

00:03.370 --> 00:04.705
- Ashley and Jared.

00:04.771 --> 00:06.640
all: Aw.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.642
- The reason Ashley and I
are here in Paradise

00:08.709 --> 00:10.277
is for us to reconnect
in a way

00:10.344 --> 00:11.578

I'm ready.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.783

00:16.850 --> 00:18.785
This is the first time
in a long time

00:18.852 --> 00:20.821
we've been able
to have alone time

00:20.888 --> 00:22.356
in a very, very special place.

00:22.422 --> 00:23.624
[flatulence]
- Oh, my God.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.625

to go on this date with me?

00:30.297 --> 00:31.465
- I would love to.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.867
- I'm crazy about you,
Miss Brook Russell.

00:33.934 --> 00:37.437
- There is something really
special between Brandon and I.

00:37.504 --> 00:38.739
- But first...

00:38.805 --> 00:40.374
- [screams] Teddi!

00:40.440 --> 00:42.743
- When Andrew and Teddi
arrived on the beach,

00:42.809 --> 00:44.177
there was an instant spark.

00:44.244 --> 00:46.213
- I feel like I kind of
already know you, but I don't.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.216
- That spark ignited and grew
on their first date.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.051

a natural connection.

00:51.118 --> 00:53.186
It just feels like
she already knows me.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.388
It's wild.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.423
- But Rodney's arrival
threatened

00:56.490 --> 00:58.091
to snuff out their flame.

00:58.158 --> 00:59.226
- I knew I was gonna like you.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.030
- God dang it.

01:03.096 --> 01:05.098
- Rodney is coming
just in time for me,

01:05.165 --> 01:07.100
because I do feel
like there might be

01:07.167 --> 01:08.535
something missing with Andrew.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.604
- And in a shocking twist...

01:10.671 --> 01:12.673
- If it can't work with him,
I just don't know

01:12.739 --> 01:14.408
if it will be able to like,
work.

01:14.474 --> 01:16.944

01:17.010 --> 01:18.478

01:20.847 --> 01:21.982
- Do you guys know
where Teddi's at?

01:22.049 --> 01:24.217
- Will Rodney end up
getting burned?

01:24.284 --> 01:25.452
- Teddi left.
- Oh, my God.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.720

07:36.256 --> 07:37.524
And I am so open.

07:37.590 --> 07:41.261

[bleep] happens fast.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.849

But like...

08:02.916 --> 08:06.286

Lights up a beach.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.688

the pain.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.499

08:23.937 --> 08:25.338
like, flirting
with little boys.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.741
She's all excited
that Rodney's here.

08:27.807 --> 08:28.975
- We're going to the bar.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.143

But I'm trying to talk to you.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.046

09:07.347 --> 09:08.381
You're gonna pencil me

09:09.449 --> 09:10.617
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.585
Rodney walked up to me
at the bar,

09:12.652 --> 09:14.754
and I just shoot my shot
right there.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.222
I was like, all right,
this is my chance.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.957

09:19.692 --> 09:21.895
What's your type,

Because if you were going for
Teddi, like what is your type?

09:24.497 --> 09:25.999

09:27.700 --> 09:29.302
Honestly--when people say
honestly, they're like,

09:29.369 --> 09:31.004

- No.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.372
No, of course.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.506

I have a type.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.010

09:37.077 --> 09:38.545
- I don't want to say it
because--

09:38.611 --> 09:39.712
- Honestly, I want to know.
- You don't want to believe it.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.081
- Say it.

What about you?
What are you looking for?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.327
Do you feel like
you have a type?

09:54.394 --> 09:57.197
- I'm--I six foot requirement,
and I need a golfer.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.198

Thank God.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.332

is getting deeper?

Okay, go ahead--

1:23:55.898 --> 1:23:58.200
I didn't hear you--like,
the comments that you did make,

1:23:58.267 --> 1:23:59.234
I didn't hear until after--

1:23:59.301 --> 1:24:01.169
- Can I explain?
- Yeah.

1:24:01.236 --> 1:24:02.804
- Her ass looks terrible.
- What is that outfit?

1:24:02.871 --> 1:24:04.373
- Are you wearing a diaper?

1:24:04.439 --> 1:24:05.774
I saw a, like--

1:24:05.841 --> 1:24:07.042
- It wasn't a [bleep] diaper.
- I know.

1:24:07.109 --> 1:24:08.777
- It was a onesie.
- Okay.

1:24:08.844 --> 1:24:09.978
Obviously, it wasn't a diaper.

1:24:10.045 --> 1:24:11.413
And that was a rude comment.

1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:13.015
- I thought
that my butt looked nice.

1:24:13.081 --> 1:24:14.750
Was it eating my ass
or something?

1:24:14.816 --> 1:24:16.752
- I just didn't--
it was a red dress,

1:24:16.818 --> 1:24:18.754
and it was just a black under.

1:24:18.820 --> 1:24:20.455
I was confused. But I'm sorry.

1:24:20.522 --> 1:24:21.790
I'm very sorry for that.
- Thank you.

1:24:21.857 --> 1:24:22.791
Like--
- I like--

1:24:22.858 --> 1:24:23.892
I like where this is going.

1:24:23.959 --> 1:24:25.327
And, like, I really--

1:24:25.394 --> 1:24:26.428
- Sounds like
we're literally like--

1:24:26.495 --> 1:24:27.629
both:
I like where this is going.

1:24:27.696 --> 1:24:28.864
- I want to continue this--

1:24:28.931 --> 1:24:30.332
- No, I consider you a friend.
- Yeah.

1:24:30.399 --> 1:24:31.333
Oh, me too.
- I really do.

1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:32.968
- We rewrote our love story.

1:24:33.035 --> 1:24:34.803
- Yeah. Seriously.
No, we really did.

1:24:34.870 --> 1:24:37.739
both: Ahh! [laughing]
