WEBVTT

00:06.373 --> 00:07.506
Ever feel
like you're being pulled

00:07.507 --> 00:09.607
in a million different
directions?

00:10.710 --> 00:11.410
Oh!

00:12.979 --> 00:13.679
Uh, sorry!

00:15.949 --> 00:16.649
My bad!

00:17.951 --> 00:19.271
- Uh!
- Sorry, ma'am.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.053
Like there's not enough time to
get through

00:21.054 --> 00:22.854
all the things you have to do.

00:22.922 --> 00:26.462
You start cutting corners just
to make it through the day.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.586
My dog walking business
isn't exactly dog walking.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.180
Oh, this is gonna hurt!

00:35.602 --> 00:36.302
Oooah!

00:38.805 --> 00:39.505
Ugh!

00:39.973 --> 00:41.373
Some days I feel
like a punching bag.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.174
Hashtag butt kicked by sister.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.651
Others a babysitter
and ballet partner

00:48.081 --> 00:49.821
for my little sister Gillian.

00:50.116 --> 00:50.816
Ah!

00:53.720 --> 00:54.420
Ah! Uh!

00:55.922 --> 00:57.456
Lawn polo, sport of the future!

00:57.457 --> 00:58.157
Whoo!

00:58.458 --> 01:00.138
Two inches, pal, two inches!

01:00.693 --> 01:03.796
Sometimes, I'm just a doofus
with a pair of scissors

01:03.797 --> 01:05.357
and a lot of grass to cut.

01:06.366 --> 01:07.806
She's my little mini-me.

01:09.102 --> 01:09.802
Ooh!

01:11.471 --> 01:13.338
I'd loved to dream
of something better,

01:13.339 --> 01:14.899
but who has time to dream?

01:17.177 --> 01:17.877
Uh.

01:19.679 --> 01:22.581
If you wanna impress
Lori Collins, why study CPR?

01:22.582 --> 01:24.716
You should be learning
mouth to mouth.

01:24.717 --> 01:27.386
Girls like Lori
only have eyes for hero types.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.707
People who save lives.

01:28.988 --> 01:30.368
Right, like lifeguards.

01:30.589 --> 01:31.429
Help me study.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.444
I gotta pass the test this year.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.554
Your pulse is racing.

01:35.995 --> 01:37.315
This CPR really works.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.765
Now take a deep breath
and hold it.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.466
Okay.

01:40.967 --> 01:41.667
Oh.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.176
Wow, you're really into this.

01:45.472 --> 01:46.172
Ugh!

01:47.874 --> 01:50.874
All you can do is breathe
and hope an easier life

01:51.845 --> 01:53.225
is somewhere out there.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:12.465 --> 02:13.965
Yeah, this is pee patrol.

02:14.934 --> 02:16.835
Got our eyes
on a foreign object.

02:16.836 --> 02:19.004
Uh, copy that, number
two, let's get that thing out

02:19.005 --> 02:20.906
of the pool as soon as possible.

02:20.907 --> 02:22.167
We're going in, over.

02:23.543 --> 02:25.403
Look at the size of that thing.

02:26.112 --> 02:28.046
What are they
feeding these kids?

02:28.047 --> 02:29.787
Floater alert! Floater alert!

02:30.316 --> 02:32.017
Better hurry, dweebs, it looks
like it might need

02:32.018 --> 02:32.918
mouth to mouth.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.773
Go back to the kiddie pool.

02:40.860 --> 02:44.160
Ignore him, guys, he hasn't
had his protein shake yet.

02:46.566 --> 02:48.934
Uh, she's gone, you can
stop sucking in your stomach.

02:48.935 --> 02:49.965
I think she smiled at me.

02:49.966 --> 02:50.836
She laughed at you.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.537
Yeah.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.105
Look, you're only
my best bro and all,

02:53.106 --> 02:55.574
but you can't compete
with the Vances of the world.

02:55.575 --> 02:58.575
That guy is confident, cool,
plays a mean guitar,

02:59.279 --> 03:01.799
drives a wicked car
and he's a lifeguard.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.883
And maybe next time you decide
to work at a place solely

03:04.884 --> 03:06.952
because the girl you're not
so secretly in love with

03:06.953 --> 03:10.253
works there, you'll actually
read the job description.

03:11.090 --> 03:11.790
Go on.

03:12.659 --> 03:13.799
This is ridiculous.

03:13.927 --> 03:14.767
It's only one!

03:15.195 --> 03:16.395
It's not gonna bite.

03:26.239 --> 03:28.340
Dude, you didn't
even go in the water.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.781
Yeah, but I saw it, too.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.043
I saw it.

03:35.114 --> 03:38.654
For the ninth consecutive
month dating back three summers,

03:40.286 --> 03:41.720
please join me in giving

03:41.721 --> 03:44.481
a great big Crash 'N Splash
round of applause

03:44.958 --> 03:48.498
to lifeguard of the month,
and my homeboy, Vance Handsome!

04:01.641 --> 04:02.341
Mwah.

04:06.479 --> 04:07.319
Ugh, ugh, ugh.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.548
Denied, sorry, bro,
that one didn't make it.

04:15.255 --> 04:15.955
I gotta go.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.071
What a freak.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.492
Forget boy Baywatch.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.327
He might be
lifeguard of the month,

04:22.328 --> 04:24.596
but you've got
a glass half full this set.

04:24.597 --> 04:28.437
You got a sweet ride, a snazzy
job, added with a cool best bro.

04:28.668 --> 04:29.368
What?

04:29.902 --> 04:31.342
My sweet ride has fleas.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.472
I fish poo for money.

04:33.473 --> 04:34.853
And my best bro is you.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.840
Your uncle has landed.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.012
Uncle Mitch?

04:53.426 --> 04:54.386
Nephew, huge me!

04:55.895 --> 04:56.595
Mm.

04:56.896 --> 04:57.596
Okay.

04:58.731 --> 04:59.431
Uh.

05:01.834 --> 05:02.534
Ta-da!

05:03.236 --> 05:04.916
I made your frown disappear.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.739
Master Sheldon,
nephew's faithful companion.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.236
My frown is all good.

05:11.811 --> 05:12.511
Okay.

05:13.112 --> 05:15.152
Gentlemen,
I need you assistance.

05:19.819 --> 05:20.519
Whoa.

05:22.121 --> 05:22.821
Ta-da!

05:23.389 --> 05:24.169
What is that?

05:25.391 --> 05:27.131
Obviously it's a tanning bed.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.660
Frankenstein's tanning bed.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.041
It's an industry thing.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.856
All the magicians
rock the tan in Vegas.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.633
Have you seen Copperfield?

05:34.634 --> 05:36.494
Dude like sweats the vitamin D.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.090
He really puts
the copper in Copperfield.

05:40.473 --> 05:41.173
Right?

05:43.042 --> 05:46.244
Anyway, I picked up this baby
at a sweet storage auction

05:46.245 --> 05:47.325
out in Burlington.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.448
Once I figure out
how to turn it on,

05:49.449 --> 05:51.489
I'm gonna baste
in my own juices.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.712
You're uncle's weird.

05:53.953 --> 05:54.653
Uh-huh.

05:55.154 --> 05:58.274
Now, for my next trick,
I'm gonna make this miracle

06:00.026 --> 06:02.606
of not-so-modern tanology
go from this van

06:04.530 --> 06:05.370
to that garage

06:06.532 --> 06:08.692
without even laying a finger
on it.

06:09.635 --> 06:10.535
- What?
- Now.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.473
Uh, gift cards?

06:15.742 --> 06:17.782
For your efforts,
kind gentlemen.

06:17.944 --> 06:18.644
Chop, chop.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.116
Yeah, there's a 99.9% chance
there's nothing on these.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.377
I'll take those odds.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.252
Listen to your Uncle Mitch.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.633
He's the one in charge.

06:28.688 --> 06:31.056
Adam, don't forget about
Gillian's dance recital.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.358
Oh, and don't
forget about karate class.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.060
Bye, guys, have a magical time.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.021
We will, thanks.

06:36.195 --> 06:37.395
See you in one week.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.537
- Love you!
- Bye.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.278
They'll be okay, right?

06:40.433 --> 06:41.533
Yeah, what could go wrong?

06:41.534 --> 06:42.834
Your brother's a magician.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.395
That's what I'm afraid of.

06:44.937 --> 06:45.637
Wah!

06:48.241 --> 06:50.942
Okay, who wants to see me
pull a rabbit out of my pants?

06:50.943 --> 06:51.643
I'm out.

06:53.014 --> 06:53.714
You're in?

06:53.913 --> 06:54.413
Mm-hmm.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.114
All right.

07:02.054 --> 07:02.954
Gotta get back.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.056
Ow.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.858
Ow, dude, stay on your side.

07:06.859 --> 07:08.359
I can't win if I do that.

07:09.028 --> 07:11.396
I have to say, running power
through the treehouse

07:11.397 --> 07:14.697
was the best idea since
glow-in-the-dark toilet paper.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.469
Tomorrow, I'm gonna put a
signal booster on the SAT router

07:17.470 --> 07:20.070
so we can stream HD
to the 42-inch wireless.

07:20.071 --> 07:20.771
Yeah.

07:21.007 --> 07:21.973
This is gonna be great.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.014
Adam's got
no parents for a week.

07:24.243 --> 07:24.943
Uh!

07:26.712 --> 07:29.052
Oh, come on,
Gillian, are you serious?

07:32.218 --> 07:32.918
Ew.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.413
I'm in the zone.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.954
I ain't got time to wipe.

07:38.257 --> 07:39.791
Where is Gillian, by the way?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.326
She asked me
to play hide and seek with her

07:41.327 --> 07:42.467
like two hours ago.

07:44.564 --> 07:45.264
What?

07:46.032 --> 07:46.872
Two hours ago?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.401
What can I say,
she's good at hiding.

07:49.402 --> 07:50.302
Like pro level.

07:50.570 --> 07:51.703
But you didn't
even look for her.

07:51.704 --> 07:53.624
Strategy, Baker, I wait 'em out.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.295
What, do I got
something on my face?

08:00.980 --> 08:01.680
Gillian!

08:03.683 --> 08:05.183
It's probably best to
stick together, you know?

08:05.184 --> 08:07.986
No, no, no, we'll take the
basement, you take the garage.

08:07.987 --> 08:08.687
All right.

08:23.035 --> 08:23.735
Gillian?

08:24.804 --> 08:26.364
It's your old pal Sheldon.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.899
Look, I'm really sorry
I didn't look for you.

08:30.543 --> 08:31.983
No hard feelings, right?

08:33.011 --> 08:33.712
Gillian!

08:39.150 --> 08:39.851
Hello?

08:41.153 --> 08:43.852
If you're down here,
I just want you to know

08:45.625 --> 08:47.185
it was all Sheldon's idea.

08:52.398 --> 08:53.098
Ah!

08:55.601 --> 08:57.736
Gillian, this is
Uncle Mitch's tanning bed.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.537
I don't think you should be...

09:03.042 --> 09:03.742
Ah!

09:04.043 --> 09:04.743
Surprise!

09:05.044 --> 09:05.744
Uh, uh, uh?

09:07.246 --> 09:07.946
What?

09:10.116 --> 09:11.116
That is not cool.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.077
I'm telling mom.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.018
Hashtag.

09:13.486 --> 09:14.186
What?

09:14.487 --> 09:15.720
What does that even mean?

09:15.721 --> 09:16.721
Gillian, where's Adam?

09:16.722 --> 09:17.562
Getting a tan.

09:19.191 --> 09:19.971
What is that?

09:20.826 --> 09:22.626
Guys, I gotta get out of here.

09:22.995 --> 09:23.995
Open it, open it.

09:23.996 --> 09:24.629
It won't open.

09:24.630 --> 09:25.463
It's like a safe.

09:25.464 --> 09:26.164
What?

09:31.771 --> 09:35.011
Guys, okay... okay, so now
it's glowing and spinning.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.003
Why is it doing that?

09:39.011 --> 09:39.711
Uh-oh.

09:40.012 --> 09:40.712
Uh-oh?

09:40.713 --> 09:41.973
What does uh-oh mean?

09:43.054 --> 09:44.014
Just open it up!

10:00.166 --> 10:02.026
He looks even paler than usual.

10:02.702 --> 10:03.402
Okay.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.257
The party's over.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.852
You guys gotta go.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.047
Uh.

10:39.238 --> 10:39.938
Uh!

10:59.291 --> 11:01.226
Do you know
we talk in our sleep?

11:01.227 --> 11:01.927
Uh, aaahh!

11:03.158 --> 11:03.858
Uh!

11:03.996 --> 11:04.696
Oh.

11:05.197 --> 11:05.897
Uh.

11:16.008 --> 11:16.708
Uh. Oh.

11:18.110 --> 11:18.810
Ah!

11:19.211 --> 11:19.911
Oh!

11:20.513 --> 11:21.213
Cranky.

11:22.084 --> 11:22.681
What is it?

11:22.682 --> 11:23.462
What's wrong?

11:23.849 --> 11:24.929
Oh, just a scream.

11:26.318 --> 11:29.738
Yes, I thought I saw a... clown
underneath my... my bed.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.091
A clown!

11:33.793 --> 11:34.493
A... where?

11:35.394 --> 11:36.234
I hate clowns!

11:36.729 --> 11:38.409
Uh, it was just a bad dream.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.339
Video games after midnight
not a good idea.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.791
Promise to behave?

11:55.681 --> 11:56.381
Uh.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.824
Oh, those are from last week.

11:59.985 --> 12:01.005
Oh, so I smelled.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.053
Who are you?

12:15.501 --> 12:16.521
What do you mean?

12:16.602 --> 12:17.302
I'm you.

12:31.150 --> 12:31.850
All right.

12:32.218 --> 12:32.918
Ah!

12:33.219 --> 12:33.919
Oh.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.094
Am I that bad?

12:39.692 --> 12:40.892
Uh, Sheldon... dude.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.829
This should be
very cooling on the eyes.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.150
And now the cucumbers.

12:46.732 --> 12:47.512
There you go.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.180
Hashtag treat yourself.

12:49.668 --> 12:50.808
I can't watch this.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.798
You do know it's not me, right?

12:58.244 --> 12:58.944
Ah!

13:01.147 --> 13:01.927
What are you?

13:02.208 --> 13:02.988
An evil twin?

13:03.182 --> 13:04.082
A doppelganger?

13:04.383 --> 13:05.683
What have you done
with our wingman?

13:05.684 --> 13:07.244
Guys, guys, it's me, okay?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.060
That's not me.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.049
Well, it is, kind of.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.557
It's like... it's like a clone.

13:12.558 --> 13:14.058
Like a clone thing, you know?

13:14.059 --> 13:14.759
Clones?

13:15.127 --> 13:17.195
Like brothers from
the same brother?

13:17.196 --> 13:18.463
This just doesn't happen.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.164
What?

13:19.498 --> 13:21.332
Did he just appear
out of thin air?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.033
No.

13:29.141 --> 13:29.841
Here it is.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.349
No, no, no.

13:37.950 --> 13:38.650
I saw it!

13:38.951 --> 13:39.651
I'm next!

13:41.420 --> 13:43.100
There isn't gonna be a next!

13:45.157 --> 13:45.857
Ugh!

13:49.228 --> 13:49.928
Hey!

13:52.565 --> 13:54.725
I said there isn't
gonna be a next.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.681
You do realize that was the
cord to the treadmill, right?

14:02.675 --> 14:03.375
Yeah, I do.

14:05.444 --> 14:06.144
Whatever.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.814
Dude, this is the most awesomest
thing that ever happened to us.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.850
If you can't see how
amazed balls this is...

14:11.851 --> 14:14.485
Okay, fine, it's amazed
balls, but we have to play it

14:14.486 --> 14:15.186
safe.

14:15.921 --> 14:17.856
You guys have to agree that we
won't go anywhere near it

14:17.857 --> 14:19.691
until we decide exactly
what to do with it.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.392
Mm-hmm.

14:20.759 --> 14:21.719
All right, good.

14:22.928 --> 14:25.388
'Cause right now
we got bigger problems.

14:25.664 --> 14:27.065
You already
look ten years younger.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.333
Okay, Gillian's
in her own world,

14:28.334 --> 14:29.634
so she probably won't notice.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.735
But nothing
gets past Uncle Mitch.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.005
He may not be
a very good magician,

14:34.006 --> 14:36.046
but he's a master
of observation.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.343
You have got
to stop working so hard.

14:38.344 --> 14:39.044
What the...

14:39.945 --> 14:41.145
Here comes the boom.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.451
Did you make me
chocolate chip pancakes

14:46.452 --> 14:48.012
with smiley faces on them?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.814
Your favorite, right?

14:49.922 --> 14:52.502
Sherlock Holmes
is definitely on the case.

14:54.126 --> 14:54.826
Uh!

14:55.694 --> 14:56.954
Greatest nephew ever!

14:59.565 --> 15:00.265
Okay.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.334
But I mean
what if he's dangerous?

15:03.335 --> 15:05.136
How do we know that thing's
not a complete psycho?

15:05.137 --> 15:07.505
Uh, it's smiley-face
chocolate chip pancakes, dude.

15:07.506 --> 15:08.873
That's like scientific proof.

15:08.874 --> 15:09.874
What a beautiful day.

15:09.875 --> 15:10.655
It's strange.

15:10.976 --> 15:12.716
He's an exact replica of you,

15:12.878 --> 15:14.879
but you don't have
anything in common.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.120
He's responsible, organized
and makes a mean pancake.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.786
It's as if the machine
is somehow overcompensating

15:21.787 --> 15:24.367
for those personality bits
you're missing.

15:25.224 --> 15:25.924
Baker!

15:26.225 --> 15:26.925
Ah!

15:27.459 --> 15:30.579
Do I or do I not pay you
good money to mow my lawn?

15:31.630 --> 15:32.597
Well, see, now
that you mentioned it...

15:32.598 --> 15:33.298
Look at it!

15:33.632 --> 15:34.652
It's four inches!

15:35.234 --> 15:35.954
Four inches!

15:36.969 --> 15:38.529
My hair isn't four inches.

15:39.538 --> 15:40.858
You measure your hair?

15:42.107 --> 15:45.707
If it's not done by the time
I get back from doing Pilates,

15:46.278 --> 15:48.613
I'll find someone else
to do the job for ya.

15:48.614 --> 15:49.314
Capiche?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.315
Okay.

15:50.382 --> 15:51.082
Gesundheit.

15:51.150 --> 15:51.850
Hey!

15:52.918 --> 15:55.318
There's a lot of
other Adams out there.

15:57.156 --> 15:58.116
Uh, other Adams?

15:59.258 --> 16:01.418
I don't really know
anything about.

16:01.827 --> 16:02.847
Just get it done.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.062
Okay.

16:04.496 --> 16:05.336
Come on, baby.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.928
Remind me why you cut
Tony Pepperoni's lawn again?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.273
Because my allowance
is like five bucks a week.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.734
Besides, Mr. Galatte's
my best customer.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.283
He's your only customer.

16:19.445 --> 16:20.145
Exactly.

16:20.646 --> 16:22.947
That's why I can't
lose my only customer.

16:22.948 --> 16:24.282
And I can't miss
the morning staff meeting

16:24.283 --> 16:25.423
at Crash 'N Splash.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.005
If only you can be
at two places at once.

16:29.421 --> 16:30.121
Huh, huh?

16:30.422 --> 16:31.262
Yeah, if only.

16:32.563 --> 16:33.263
Uh.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.192
Oh.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.378
Hi, everybody.

16:48.874 --> 16:50.008
No one can hear you,

16:50.009 --> 16:52.529
because you're not holding
the kickboard.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.181
Can everyone hear me now?

16:57.750 --> 16:58.450
Yes.

17:00.119 --> 17:02.653
As you all know, attendance
at Crash 'N Splash

17:02.654 --> 17:03.974
is way down this year.

17:04.323 --> 17:05.022
Huh?

17:05.457 --> 17:06.891
Which means our annual
Splash-apalooza fundraiser

17:06.892 --> 17:07.852
is top priority.

17:09.762 --> 17:11.321
This place needs our help.

17:12.564 --> 17:16.284
Now Vance and his crazy popular
band, Vance Vance Revolution,

17:17.136 --> 17:19.955
have generously offered
to headline the event.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.013
We love you, Vance!

17:23.976 --> 17:26.616
But there's still
a lot of work to be done.

17:26.811 --> 17:28.972
So if anyone
has any time to spare,

17:29.181 --> 17:30.915
I'm looking for volunteers
with fresh ideas

17:30.916 --> 17:32.617
to join me
on the planning committee.

17:32.618 --> 17:33.318
Anyone?

17:38.223 --> 17:40.792
Dude, did you forget to use
deo this morning?

17:40.793 --> 17:41.493
Huh, huh?

17:42.861 --> 17:43.861
Oh, thank you, Adam.

17:43.862 --> 17:44.562
Huh?

17:46.432 --> 17:47.332
You're welcome.

17:47.433 --> 17:48.453
Seriously, Baker?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.087
What fresh ideas
could you possib...

17:52.137 --> 17:54.297
You can barely
keep your shorts on.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.809
Need I remind everyone
of last summer's lifeguard test,

17:57.810 --> 17:59.010
the filter incident?

18:01.246 --> 18:01.946
Oh, no!

18:02.247 --> 18:02.947
Hi, ladies.

18:10.622 --> 18:13.091
Or does this have
something to do with the time

18:13.092 --> 18:15.893
I caught you secretly snapping
phone pics of Lori

18:15.894 --> 18:18.114
while she was teaching
basic rescue?

18:20.899 --> 18:23.059
They were for
the newsletter, okay?

18:23.135 --> 18:23.835
I swear.

18:25.170 --> 18:25.870
Okay.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.673
I don't know what
you're so upset about.

18:28.674 --> 18:29.907
With you on the planning
committee,

18:29.908 --> 18:31.976
Lori will have no excuse
not to notice you.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.178
Yeah, I'm not sure
that's such a good thing.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.880
Besides, where exactly
am I supposed to find

18:35.881 --> 18:37.081
the extra time to...

18:37.483 --> 18:38.263
What is that?

18:41.954 --> 18:42.674
Oh, my gosh.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.722
He's supposed to be
watching Number Two?

18:44.723 --> 18:45.863
Are you kidding me?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.238
What is this?

18:47.693 --> 18:49.393
Something Number Two whipped up.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.754
It's a low-fat mango-licous
pineapple, banana smoothie.

18:52.764 --> 18:54.504
A taste of tropical paradise.

18:54.575 --> 18:55.275
Mwah.

18:55.534 --> 18:56.234
What?

18:56.435 --> 18:57.215
Care for one?

18:59.538 --> 19:02.478
Ah, okay, is this
what you got me doing all day?

19:02.808 --> 19:04.041
Being your man servant?

19:04.042 --> 19:05.109
Just the one of you.

19:05.110 --> 19:05.950
The one of me?

19:15.254 --> 19:17.954
He hasn't tried starting
a fire yet, has he?

19:18.991 --> 19:19.711
Oooh, uh-oh.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.145
Ah, it burns!

19:28.800 --> 19:29.940
What have you done?

19:29.968 --> 19:30.748
It wasn't me.

19:31.003 --> 19:31.703
It was him.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.451
Okay, don't be mad, but
I crunched the numbers.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.575
And in order for us to expand
our lawn business,

19:37.576 --> 19:39.916
we're gonna need
a full-time employee.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.047
Unfortunately, mistakes
were made, lessons learned.

19:43.048 --> 19:46.168
And to make a long story
short, a copy of a copy...

19:49.655 --> 19:50.795
He isn't so bright.

19:51.256 --> 19:51.956
Huh?

19:54.793 --> 19:56.713
Oh, man, he's rocking a unibrow.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.369
On the upside,

19:58.630 --> 20:00.932
he's easy to train
and extremely hard working.

20:00.933 --> 20:01.633
Ugh!

20:01.733 --> 20:02.400
Hey, Winston!

20:02.401 --> 20:02.934
Huh?

20:02.935 --> 20:03.715
What'd I say?

20:04.036 --> 20:05.703
What'd I say... about
sniffing people?

20:05.704 --> 20:06.404
No.

20:07.806 --> 20:08.906
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Winston.

20:08.907 --> 20:09.607
Down, boy.

20:09.908 --> 20:10.688
There you go.

20:10.842 --> 20:11.682
You named him?

20:11.777 --> 20:13.457
We can't all be called Adam.

20:13.745 --> 20:14.445
Ah!

20:17.783 --> 20:19.917
Strangling yourself
may be counterproductive.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.478
Also, way less profitable.

20:23.589 --> 20:24.289
Whoa.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.523
Whoa, that's like...

20:25.524 --> 20:26.424
Half the block.

20:26.792 --> 20:30.272
It was Number Two's idea
to have them pay for membership.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.716
Adam, maybe we shouldn't
overlook the possibilities

20:33.732 --> 20:35.292
this opportunity presents.

20:36.868 --> 20:37.568
Mm.

20:42.808 --> 20:43.508
Whoa!

20:45.310 --> 20:46.577
Man, if Lori
doesn't like one of me,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.678
then why she's gonna
like another?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.427
Just more of me not to like.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.069
Because it wouldn't be you.

20:52.184 --> 20:53.517
When you made your first clone,

20:53.518 --> 20:56.087
you were all worried about
Gillian, doubting yourself,

20:56.088 --> 20:58.022
wishing you were
more responsible.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.991
And who came out
of the gizmo that night?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.612
Mr. Dependable, that's who.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.360
Uh.

21:02.728 --> 21:03.894
All you have to do this time
is focus on

21:03.895 --> 21:05.695
what girls want most in a guy.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.038
What do girls
want most in a guy?

21:08.133 --> 21:08.833
Oh! I know.

21:10.035 --> 21:10.995
A good listener.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.071
Someone they can just talk to
about their deepest needs

21:14.072 --> 21:15.452
and innermost feelings.

21:15.707 --> 21:16.407
Uh, no.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.343
What they want is
a guy who can party.

21:19.344 --> 21:20.604
Everybody knows that.

21:20.679 --> 21:23.079
When did you become
an expert on girls?

21:23.181 --> 21:25.149
The closest you've been
to a date

21:25.150 --> 21:28.210
is the fruit and nut section
of the grocery store.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.620
I remember that,
do you remember that?

21:29.621 --> 21:30.581
Fine. Who cares?

21:30.956 --> 21:31.916
We'll make both.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.487
Two heads are better than one,
right?

21:33.488 --> 21:34.188
I guess.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.126
Uh!

21:36.328 --> 21:37.028
Ow!

21:37.362 --> 21:38.929
Just clear your mind
and concentrate.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.250
Good boy, here you go.

21:40.332 --> 21:41.032
Go in.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.593
I'm going, I'm going.

21:47.506 --> 21:49.006
And may the best you win.

21:56.114 --> 21:56.814
Hm.

21:57.783 --> 21:58.483
Ah.

21:59.284 --> 22:01.624
It's supposed to go out
with that one.

22:05.057 --> 22:06.757
♪ And then disappears ♪

22:11.163 --> 22:12.003
Oh, caught it!

22:12.764 --> 22:13.484
Sometimes...

22:14.266 --> 22:15.666
Ah, party boy in the house.

22:15.667 --> 22:16.447
Check me out.

22:17.636 --> 22:18.336
Mm.

22:19.538 --> 22:20.238
Oh, yah.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.326
Uh, sweet hat, yo.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.741
Too much party, too much party.

22:32.884 --> 22:33.584
Sssh.

22:36.621 --> 22:38.841
Oh, man,
laser lights, laser lights.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.060
Come on, let's go.

22:40.061 --> 22:40.991
Danny, come on, come on.

22:40.992 --> 22:41.892
Sssh, ssh, ssh.

22:43.395 --> 22:44.475
Come on, let's go.

22:47.532 --> 22:48.672
Let's go, let's go.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.121
Winston, here boy.

22:57.976 --> 22:58.756
Just drop it.

23:00.112 --> 23:00.812
Come on.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.040
What light
through yonder window breaks?

23:08.687 --> 23:09.387
Ah!

23:11.456 --> 23:13.736
The sound and smell,
love doth quake.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.163
Uh,.

23:20.866 --> 23:21.566
Ah.

23:22.934 --> 23:23.634
Sparks!

23:24.669 --> 23:27.789
And that, my dear niece,
is a Mongolian soap trick.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.080
I know, impressive.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.990
It smells in here.

23:40.619 --> 23:41.319
Hey.

23:45.357 --> 23:47.625
You know, once you get past
the grunting,

23:47.626 --> 23:49.306
he's actually kind of sweet.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.896
Dude, he's got
rug burns on his knuckles.

23:51.897 --> 23:52.617
Gnarly, bro.

23:52.898 --> 23:53.978
It's a teddy bear.

23:54.833 --> 23:55.533
Uh, ah!

23:56.334 --> 23:57.034
Om, om, om.

23:58.236 --> 23:58.936
Huh?

23:59.004 --> 23:59.904
Yo, party dawg!

24:06.077 --> 24:06.917
What do we do?

24:07.112 --> 24:07.892
I don't know.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.500
Why are we whispering?

24:12.083 --> 24:12.923
Uh, who is it?

24:15.587 --> 24:16.287
Pizza guy.

24:17.923 --> 24:19.183
Free breadsticks, yo!

24:19.724 --> 24:20.424
Winston.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.586
I gotta go back to night school.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.075
Mom was right.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.662
Gentlemen, our objective...

24:39.344 --> 24:40.424
make Adam awesome.

24:43.582 --> 24:47.062
We need to turn this drab,
dull, dweeby chunk of human...

24:48.119 --> 24:49.679
Huh, I'm right here, dude.

24:50.088 --> 24:50.788
into this.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.610
We'll take
a multi-pronged approach,

24:54.693 --> 24:56.553
focusing on career advancement.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.070
Party ability.

25:00.966 --> 25:01.666
Right on.

25:02.467 --> 25:04.267
Rock star, love of popularity.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.989
Which of course leads to...

25:06.104 --> 25:06.804
Romance.

25:07.105 --> 25:07.972
Yeah, excellent.

25:07.973 --> 25:08.673
Oh.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.434
First up, impress Lori Collins.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.445
Intel I got at the kiddie pool
yesterday

25:14.446 --> 25:16.780
confirmed that Lori
will be chaperoning

25:16.781 --> 25:19.483
her baby brother's b-day
at the mall this morning.

25:19.484 --> 25:22.424
Meaning, operation party boy
is officially a go.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.421
Winston, you're
on Gillian detail.

25:24.422 --> 25:25.982
Wait, wait, wait, Winston?

25:26.725 --> 25:28.225
He can barely stand upright
and you want him watching

25:28.226 --> 25:29.246
my little sister?

25:29.461 --> 25:31.462
We need Number Two
at Crash 'N Splash.

25:31.463 --> 25:33.731
He's got a plan to get you
off the pee patrol.

25:33.732 --> 25:34.899
I mean, what about sensitive me?

25:34.900 --> 25:35.680
He can do it.

25:35.901 --> 25:36.600
Oh, hey.

25:36.601 --> 25:37.801
That's a big negative.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.670
Your uncle has
an important gig downtown.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.038
Love and support, remember?

25:41.039 --> 25:42.506
That's Sensitive's thing.

25:42.507 --> 25:43.347
What about me?

25:43.575 --> 25:44.742
You're backing Adam at the mall

25:44.743 --> 25:46.310
in case party boy
parties too hard.

25:46.311 --> 25:47.031
I always do.

25:47.345 --> 25:48.545
Any other questions?

25:51.182 --> 25:52.142
You okay, buddy?

25:55.153 --> 25:56.293
Mah, mah, mah, mah.

25:57.155 --> 25:57.855
Uh, yeah.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.391
When doesn't this plan
blow up in our faces?

26:04.563 --> 26:05.823
Party coming through?

26:07.899 --> 26:08.599
Yeah!

26:09.970 --> 26:10.670
Whoo!

26:10.969 --> 26:11.989
Hold those hands.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.478
Come on, kids, this way.

26:15.540 --> 26:16.320
Stay with me.

26:17.008 --> 26:17.788
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

26:18.209 --> 26:19.409
Where'd he get that?

26:19.511 --> 26:20.891
I'm guessing from them.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.113
Security!

26:22.480 --> 26:24.248
Keep going, and call for backup!

26:24.249 --> 26:25.689
Have party, will travel!

26:25.917 --> 26:26.617
Whoo!

26:30.689 --> 26:32.909
Dude with the lampshade,
stand down!

26:40.298 --> 26:40.998
And plié.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.035
And lift.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.337
Lift.

26:47.939 --> 26:48.639
Lift.

26:49.140 --> 26:49.840
Uh!

26:51.376 --> 26:52.336
Whee! Nailed it!

27:04.656 --> 27:06.276
Sorry, I'll get that later.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.599
Nephew, thanks
for tagging along.

27:10.662 --> 27:12.222
Boy, your hair grows fast.

27:12.497 --> 27:14.798
Anyway, thought if you saw me
in action

27:14.799 --> 27:18.039
it might help you understand
the magic that is Mitch.

27:18.303 --> 27:21.903
Uncle Mitch, the only person
who needs to understand you...

27:22.874 --> 27:23.574
is you.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.248
How is this my life?

27:32.384 --> 27:33.404
Oh, there, there.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.485
It's not that bad.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.266
Not that bad?

27:35.687 --> 27:38.188
I had to pay them
to let me work this place.

27:38.189 --> 27:38.889
Oh.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.891
I was supposed to be
one of the greats.

27:40.892 --> 27:44.252
But I can't keep up with all
these upstart magic yahoos

27:44.295 --> 27:45.729
with their tight leather pants,

27:45.730 --> 27:48.010
the cool tattoos,
their awesome tans.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.413
I've tried to mix things up.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.709
I even got a nose ring
last fall.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.858
Worst infection of my life.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.033
Maybe that's your problem.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.369
You're not them.

27:59.277 --> 27:59.977
You're you.

28:00.912 --> 28:03.732
You're Magic Mitch,
and that's pretty magical.

28:04.115 --> 28:07.715
Excuse me, young man, is this
where we get our bingo cards?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.820
Sorry, ma'am, there's no bingo
today...

28:12.157 --> 28:12.857
just magic.

28:14.793 --> 28:15.493
Oh!

28:17.195 --> 28:17.915
What he say?

28:18.530 --> 28:20.090
They canceled bingo again.

28:20.498 --> 28:21.198
What?

28:21.533 --> 28:22.913
There's no bingo today.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.195
Get the coins out of your ears.

28:31.076 --> 28:31.776
Uh!

28:37.582 --> 28:38.602
Wow, tough crowd.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.154
This place is way too clean.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.755
Someone's been in here.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.539
Security breach!

29:10.548 --> 29:11.248
Baker!

29:11.716 --> 29:13.383
I've been going
through the books, Ed.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.124
Why aren't you on pee patrol?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.887
Because then I couldn't be
figuring out a way

29:16.888 --> 29:19.323
to save Crash 'N Splash
from running out of money

29:19.324 --> 29:20.390
and shutting down for good.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.091
Phew!

29:21.926 --> 29:24.828
And how exactly are you gonna
save the park from closing down?

29:24.829 --> 29:26.569
It won't be easy, but I found

29:26.598 --> 29:29.658
some profit-maximizing shortcuts
to boost revenue.

29:29.667 --> 29:31.168
We're still gonna need
Splash-apalooza to be

29:31.169 --> 29:34.529
a huge success, but if you do
exactly what I say, Ed...

29:35.707 --> 29:38.047
this park will have
a fighting chance.

29:40.678 --> 29:43.258
You had me
at profit-maximizing shortcuts.

29:46.284 --> 29:47.004
There it is!

29:47.525 --> 29:48.519
No, he's not a lampshade.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.020
He's wearing a lampshade.

29:50.054 --> 29:50.754
Right.

29:51.222 --> 29:52.422
Now where did he go?

29:56.161 --> 29:57.628
I shouldn't even be here today.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.330
There's fliers to be made
and tickets to be printed.

30:00.331 --> 30:03.631
And Vance has this crazy
list of demands for his band.

30:06.437 --> 30:07.137
Party.

30:19.284 --> 30:19.984
Oh.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.621
So what you're saying is
I should just stop worrying

30:24.622 --> 30:26.182
and just go with the flow?

30:27.125 --> 30:29.765
What I'm sayin' is
you need to party it up.

30:57.455 --> 30:58.155
Oh, cake!

31:02.393 --> 31:03.293
Oh, yeah, yeah.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.029
This is so much fun
and way less stressful.

31:06.030 --> 31:06.870
I know, right?

31:07.699 --> 31:08.599
Oh, yeah, baby!

31:08.900 --> 31:10.700
That's what I'm talking about!

31:12.503 --> 31:13.203
Whoo!

31:17.342 --> 31:18.782
Dude knows how to party.

31:22.080 --> 31:22.800
Plan B then?

31:42.433 --> 31:45.335
"I like to smash people's faces
into really expensive cakes."

31:45.336 --> 31:48.516
You have some nerve being
anywhere remotely near me.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.707
And since when did
you get a ponytail?

31:50.708 --> 31:51.848
Oh, it's a clip-on.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.350
I like what it says about me.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.092
But that's not why I'm here.

31:56.247 --> 31:57.627
I've come to apologize.

31:58.549 --> 31:59.329
Wait, no, no.

31:59.951 --> 32:01.571
Excuse me, random stranger.

32:01.719 --> 32:02.419
Oh.

32:03.121 --> 32:04.521
Would you mind turning that up?

32:04.522 --> 32:05.222
Oh, sure.

32:05.823 --> 32:07.193
♪ Love in the dark ♪

32:07.292 --> 32:10.262

It's great, it's great.

32:39.891 --> 32:41.391
What do you do for an encore?

32:41.392 --> 32:44.194
I was hoping to discuss
a little Splash-apalooza

32:44.195 --> 32:46.595
over a nice, organic
root bear perhaps?

32:47.298 --> 32:47.998
I can't.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.601
I have a co-captain's
lunch meeting with Vance.

32:51.602 --> 32:52.502
Oh. How tragic.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.666
Perhaps another time then.

33:02.747 --> 33:04.907
Danny, initiate
Operation Mustache.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.780
I got a 10-14 in Tower 3,
need back-up immediately.

33:18.997 --> 33:19.697
Copy, kid.

33:20.298 --> 33:20.998
Uh!

33:29.707 --> 33:30.407
Hey!

33:32.176 --> 33:32.956
Who did that?

33:33.377 --> 33:34.077
Him!

33:34.345 --> 33:35.605
Yo, what's up, Vance?

33:35.913 --> 33:36.873
Come and get me!

33:37.782 --> 33:39.402
You in the lampshade, stop!

33:39.617 --> 33:41.057
Oh, yeah, rock and roll.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.486
Out of the way, coming through.

33:42.487 --> 33:43.187
Ahh!

33:43.921 --> 33:44.621
Lifeguard!

33:45.056 --> 33:46.256
- Lifeguard!
- Hey!

33:46.257 --> 33:46.957
Lifeguard.

33:49.894 --> 33:50.914
I got you, Baker!

33:51.235 --> 33:52.195
Bring it, Vance!

33:52.196 --> 33:53.336
Can't hide from me.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.164
Touch down!

33:54.832 --> 33:55.532
Ah!

33:59.370 --> 34:00.210
I got you now.

34:01.239 --> 34:01.939
Whoa.

34:02.673 --> 34:03.373
Baker.

34:03.674 --> 34:04.634
Smell you later.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.069
Oh, when I get my hands on you.

34:07.245 --> 34:07.945
Uh!

34:08.913 --> 34:09.693
Later, dudes!

34:10.815 --> 34:11.655
Come on, boys!

34:11.882 --> 34:12.583
Huh?

34:18.255 --> 34:20.896
Vance can't dance,
you are clear for lunch.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.253
I hope you don't mind,

34:30.368 --> 34:34.027
but I gave Phil a sweet tip
to whip us up something special.

34:37.308 --> 34:38.007
What is it?

34:38.543 --> 34:40.677
It's one part chicken nuggets,
two parts fish and chips

34:40.678 --> 34:42.237
and two parts real cheese.

34:43.648 --> 34:45.328
I call it, son of tuna melt.

34:46.818 --> 34:47.518
Oh.

34:47.819 --> 34:48.518
Try it.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.029
Adam, this is really lovely...

34:59.030 --> 35:00.770
Shush, my melancholy mermaid.

35:04.802 --> 35:06.970
But there comes a time
in every man's life

35:06.971 --> 35:09.172
where their own mortality
must be thrown to the wind.

35:09.173 --> 35:12.593
Like the seeds of indifference
blown asunder by the lips

35:13.010 --> 35:14.270
of a hungry goldfish.

35:16.581 --> 35:18.982
I have absolutely no idea
what I'm talking about.

35:18.983 --> 35:21.623
Neither does she,
but I think it's working.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.089
And if I should be swept up
in a hurricane of jealously,

35:26.090 --> 35:28.191
let it rip me limp by limp
until my beating heart

35:28.192 --> 35:29.392
is all that remains.

35:29.994 --> 35:33.294
Defiant in its own conviction
for a breeze only for...

35:35.433 --> 35:36.133
Vance.

35:36.834 --> 35:37.534
Huh?

35:37.635 --> 35:38.335
I gotta go.

35:39.737 --> 35:40.757
I got you, Baker!

35:47.645 --> 35:48.965
Vance... are you okay?

35:51.382 --> 35:53.842
We should probably
get you to first aid.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.175
I'll go with you.

35:58.189 --> 35:59.449
I don't feel so good.

35:59.624 --> 36:00.324
Uh.

36:01.025 --> 36:03.093
She's never
gonna talk to me again.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.361
If there's any consolation,

36:04.362 --> 36:06.263
she doesn't
really talk to you now.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.131
Keep that chin up, kid,
we're gonna change that.

36:08.132 --> 36:09.692
Now let's get out of here.

36:10.835 --> 36:11.535
Let's go.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.307
Oh, a little bit of this,
oh, a little of that.

36:17.308 --> 36:18.008
Uh, uh, uh!

36:26.384 --> 36:27.884
Guys, I've been thinking.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.412
Maybe what we're doing
isn't right.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.095
I feel like such a liar.

36:32.623 --> 36:33.857
And Lori deserves better.

36:33.858 --> 36:36.293
Whoa, dude, I know
we've had a few bumps,

36:36.294 --> 36:37.627
but you can't just give up.

36:37.628 --> 36:38.328
Uh, ouch!

36:39.130 --> 36:40.930
I'm giving in to expectations.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.300
What about Splash-apalooza?

36:43.301 --> 36:45.701
You're a two-person
planning committee?

36:47.305 --> 36:48.385
I... I don't know.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.594
I'll tell her something came up.

36:53.145 --> 36:53.743
Hey, you're home.

36:53.744 --> 36:54.444
Oh!

36:55.813 --> 36:57.513
Ah, guys, it's her, it's Lori.

36:57.514 --> 36:58.214
It's Lori.

36:58.382 --> 36:59.082
Hide!

36:59.317 --> 37:00.083
Duck and cover, dudes!

37:00.084 --> 37:00.784
Run!

37:09.160 --> 37:10.000
Whoo, be cool.

37:12.196 --> 37:14.130
In a lot of countries,
slamming the door

37:14.131 --> 37:16.733
in someone's face would
actually be considered rude.

37:16.734 --> 37:17.874
Is this one of 'em?

37:20.067 --> 37:20.767
Sssh.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.539
Here, here, come in, come in.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.560
Me casa you casa.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.108
Stupid.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.379
You don't
have to pretend anymore.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.520
I know your secret.

37:32.650 --> 37:33.350
You do?

37:33.818 --> 37:35.051
It's not what it looks like.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.253
I wanted to tell you,
but it's hard to explain.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.834
I admit I was
a little surprised at first.

37:39.957 --> 37:42.057
But it's nothing
to be ashamed of.

37:44.161 --> 37:44.861
It isn't?

37:45.162 --> 37:47.622
I just never took you
for a poet before.

37:48.799 --> 37:50.539
You left it at the snack bar.

37:50.735 --> 37:51.435
Ah.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.983
Don't be mad, but I kind of
flipped through it.

37:55.473 --> 37:56.173
And?

37:56.507 --> 37:57.227
Coming down!

38:00.978 --> 38:02.778
It's okay, I'm a professional.

38:03.581 --> 38:06.316
You haven't seen a small set of
silver keys, by any chance,

38:06.317 --> 38:07.017
have you?

38:08.919 --> 38:09.753
Come and get it, Uncle Mitch.

38:09.754 --> 38:10.454
I'm on it.

38:15.793 --> 38:17.113
Here we go, all right.

38:17.234 --> 38:17.934
Thank you.

38:18.162 --> 38:18.862
Wait.

38:20.798 --> 38:24.068
♪ Here I am,
rocking like a hurricane ♪

38:25.770 --> 38:26.670
Stupid bicycle.

38:27.041 --> 38:27.741
Lori!

38:28.039 --> 38:29.119
Why is Vince here?

38:29.407 --> 38:32.527
Oh, we've got this
senior lifeguard barbeque thing.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.577
I told him to pick me up here.

38:35.346 --> 38:36.746
I didn't know
Adam Baker had a house.

38:36.747 --> 38:37.447
Lifeguards.

38:37.748 --> 38:38.448
Yeah.

38:38.683 --> 38:40.363
Can't be late, I better run.

38:41.752 --> 38:42.452
Let's go!

38:43.387 --> 38:44.087
Hi, guys.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.880
Nail you later, loser!

38:55.766 --> 38:57.686
I'm not a loser, I'm a magician!

38:58.669 --> 39:00.349
It's a respected profession.

39:01.772 --> 39:02.772
Don't sweat it, bro.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.074
You can't compete with that.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.515
He's a senior lifeguard.

39:05.776 --> 39:06.476
With a car.

39:06.777 --> 39:07.477
And a band.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.065
And amazing hair.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.833
Wait, wait, that's it.

39:12.249 --> 39:13.616
Why didn't I think
of this before?

39:13.617 --> 39:16.797
Guys, the only way to fight
perfect is with perfect.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.763
Ready or not, here I come.

39:50.121 --> 39:51.801
Oh, it's totally going down.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.158
Wish I could see it
with my own two eyes,

39:55.159 --> 39:57.379
but nature called
and I must answer.

40:02.233 --> 40:02.933
Hi.

40:07.805 --> 40:08.885
You're in my seat.

40:09.974 --> 40:10.674
Oh, yeah?

40:15.513 --> 40:16.713
Who's gonna move me?

40:19.483 --> 40:20.183
Ah!

40:23.554 --> 40:24.254
Help!

40:29.160 --> 40:30.060
That's my save.

40:31.328 --> 40:32.028
I got you.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.698
Everyone back,
give him some room.

40:38.536 --> 40:39.236
Adam?

40:49.780 --> 40:50.480
Thank you.

40:50.781 --> 40:51.921
That was bodacious.

40:54.552 --> 40:56.472
And that's how it's done, Vance.

40:56.654 --> 40:57.354
Urh!

41:06.363 --> 41:08.163
Mind if I borrow some of this?

41:08.999 --> 41:09.999
Come here you little twerp.

41:10.000 --> 41:10.700
Baker?

41:11.936 --> 41:13.136
Great work, homeboy.

41:13.370 --> 41:14.990
You, sir, are in the chair.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.486
What? This is my shift.

41:17.675 --> 41:18.395
Not anymore.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.056
Vance, you're on break.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.644
It's time to give
the new talent a shot.

41:21.645 --> 41:22.965
He hasn't even tested.

41:23.113 --> 41:23.893
Pfew, tested?

41:25.516 --> 41:26.950
Did you see
what he did over there?

41:26.951 --> 41:28.271
That's real life, son.

41:28.552 --> 41:30.286
The kid's got the stuff,
now give him the chair.

41:30.287 --> 41:32.147
- But Mr...
- That's an order.

41:39.563 --> 41:41.903
You do realize
I must destroy you now?

41:42.833 --> 41:43.533
Bring it.

41:52.610 --> 41:53.630
Wow, I'm awesome!

41:54.512 --> 41:55.592
And I'm dead meat.

41:58.516 --> 41:59.296
Vance! Vance!

41:59.917 --> 42:00.617
Wait up!

42:00.918 --> 42:01.618
Vance!

42:02.386 --> 42:03.086
Wait up!

42:03.554 --> 42:04.514
We need to talk.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.189
Vance?

42:06.724 --> 42:09.926
Vance, we need to go over
the set list for the fundraiser.

42:09.927 --> 42:11.294
Why should I help Mattis?

42:11.295 --> 42:13.229
I'm like
lifeguard of the century,

42:13.230 --> 42:15.431
and he's gonna take
some rookie's side over mine.

42:15.432 --> 42:17.052
Vance, you're overreacting.

42:17.434 --> 42:18.134
Am I?

42:18.435 --> 42:21.075
I just got dethroned
by Captain Pee Patrol.

42:28.412 --> 42:29.132
Need a lift?

42:30.381 --> 42:31.081
Huh?

42:48.899 --> 42:49.899
Thanks for the ride.

42:49.900 --> 42:50.600
No problem.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.368
What's going on with you, Adam?

42:59.877 --> 43:02.712
Every time I see you you seem
like a different person.

43:02.713 --> 43:05.653
Maybe you just don't
know me well enough... yet.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.244
We should do something
to fix that.

43:14.658 --> 43:17.178
Well, we do
need to talk Splash-apalooza.

43:18.095 --> 43:19.235
Seven o'clock then?

43:19.930 --> 43:20.630
Sounds...

43:21.565 --> 43:22.265
Perfect.

43:41.151 --> 43:41.851
Guys.

43:42.853 --> 43:44.713
We're bringing him in too soon.

43:44.855 --> 43:45.755
He's not ready.

43:45.956 --> 43:46.656
What?

43:46.991 --> 43:47.951
What'd you mean?

43:48.058 --> 43:49.138
I'm totally ready.

43:49.226 --> 43:51.506
Look, I even got
my lucky socks, see?

43:52.529 --> 43:53.229
Ugh, oh!

43:55.399 --> 43:56.959
Lori's not just some girl.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.154
We can't risk it.

43:58.235 --> 43:59.615
Maybe you have a point.

43:59.937 --> 44:01.904
We're running out of first
impressions, and I'm not sure

44:01.905 --> 44:03.973
we want our best player
on the bench for this one.

44:03.974 --> 44:04.674
No.

44:05.009 --> 44:06.089
Man, you're right.

44:06.677 --> 44:08.244
I can't sit across
from someone like Lori

44:08.245 --> 44:10.165
and act suave and sophisticated.

44:10.547 --> 44:12.587
I can't
even figure out my socks.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.250
I'm just gonna call
the whole thing off.

44:14.251 --> 44:15.391
Whoa, whoa, no way.

44:15.853 --> 44:17.413
I'm not standing up, Lori.

44:17.421 --> 44:19.101
Just trust me, I got this...

44:20.224 --> 44:22.504
'cause we'll be
right there with you.

44:25.295 --> 44:26.975
I feel kind of underdressed.

44:27.531 --> 44:30.633
I thought we were just meeting
to talk about the fundraiser.

44:30.634 --> 44:33.694
Uh, uh, you know,
fundraiser talk makes me hungry.

44:39.677 --> 44:41.911
I have to get in there and
save this or she's gonna walk.

44:41.912 --> 44:44.981
You can't just barge in,
she'll know you're a fake Adam.

44:44.982 --> 44:45.682
Just wait.

44:46.350 --> 44:48.810
He's supposed to tag out
any second now.

44:48.886 --> 44:50.019
So I made two fliers.

44:50.020 --> 44:50.720
Mm.

44:51.121 --> 44:53.161
Um, which one
do you like better?

44:53.457 --> 44:55.497
I like, um,
colors, font, pretty.

44:58.595 --> 45:00.935
Excuse me,
I need to use the bathroom.

45:04.468 --> 45:05.535
Dude, what are you doing?

45:05.536 --> 45:06.916
You got like zero game.

45:07.204 --> 45:08.944
Dude, I told you to trust me.

45:09.675 --> 45:10.640
Give me the jacket.

45:10.641 --> 45:11.341
No, no.

45:12.476 --> 45:13.676
Give me your jacket.

45:15.808 --> 45:16.508
What?

45:16.747 --> 45:17.447
Oooo.

45:19.616 --> 45:21.656
Great,
now look what you've done.

45:22.252 --> 45:23.752
Forget it, I've got this.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.369
He doesn't got it.

45:33.130 --> 45:33.830
Um...

45:35.632 --> 45:37.432
what happened in the bathroom?

45:39.403 --> 45:41.863
There was crazy
toilet suction in there.

45:43.173 --> 45:44.173
You wanna get out of here?

45:44.174 --> 45:44.841
Yeah.

45:44.842 --> 45:45.542
Okay.

45:57.087 --> 45:58.621
I've got something to tell you.

45:58.622 --> 46:00.022
You know that guy you saw today?

46:00.023 --> 46:03.503
The cool, confident one who
swooped in and saved the day?

46:05.929 --> 46:07.429
Well, it's not really me.

46:08.832 --> 46:09.732
Not even close.

46:10.968 --> 46:12.768
I mean, that was like a fluke.

46:13.437 --> 46:16.257
Truth is, I'm not
even that good of a swimmer.

46:16.807 --> 46:19.807
I failed the lifeguard test
three years in a row.

46:20.010 --> 46:21.810
Oh, yeah, the filter incident.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.901
Well, maybe I can help you.

46:27.518 --> 46:31.238
Show you a few tricks of the
trade, one lifeguard to another.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.078
So where are you taking me?

46:36.093 --> 46:37.860
To a place I know you'll love.

46:37.861 --> 46:38.561
Come on.

46:39.032 --> 46:39.829
Where are they going?

46:39.830 --> 46:41.030
This isn't the plan.

46:46.703 --> 46:47.723
Where's he going?

46:52.643 --> 46:54.143
I know you like this place.

46:54.144 --> 46:54.844
Let's go.

47:14.832 --> 47:15.532
Wow!

47:16.400 --> 47:18.201
Don't you get enough
working here all day?

47:18.202 --> 47:19.102
I love it here.

47:19.536 --> 47:21.137
I mean, I used to make my
parents bring me here

47:21.138 --> 47:22.518
once a week all summer.

47:22.940 --> 47:24.674
I can still feel the road rash
from all hours

47:24.675 --> 47:26.355
I spent on the Plank Plunge.

47:27.845 --> 47:28.925
I know it's weird.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.332
It's not weird at all.

47:30.914 --> 47:33.494
Actually, I'd come here
on summer vacation

47:33.684 --> 47:35.724
and see the lifeguards
and think,

47:35.953 --> 47:38.353
"wow, they get to come here
every day."

47:39.623 --> 47:41.757
There's not a better job
in the world.

47:41.758 --> 47:45.118
And... I can't even think about
what would happen if...

47:46.363 --> 47:48.331
this fundraiser
wasn't a success.

47:48.332 --> 47:49.032
It will be.

47:49.967 --> 47:53.147
Okay, but for right now,
let's not think about that.

47:53.470 --> 47:54.970
Let's just have some fun.

48:01.378 --> 48:02.078
Ha!

48:02.412 --> 48:03.112
You won?

48:03.914 --> 48:04.754
How'd you win?

48:05.616 --> 48:06.316
Holy.

48:09.019 --> 48:10.039
Do you want this?

48:11.388 --> 48:12.528
This is a disaster.

48:12.890 --> 48:16.550
Lori doesn't wanna play skeeball
and go on the tilt-a-whirl.

48:16.593 --> 48:18.160
She's a sophisticated girl.

48:18.161 --> 48:19.001
Dude, chillax.

48:19.930 --> 48:20.950
It's going great.

48:21.899 --> 48:22.599
Great?

48:22.933 --> 48:25.753
But this is my date,
and he's embarrassing us.

48:25.969 --> 48:26.669
Want this?

48:27.304 --> 48:28.004
Whoo-hoo.

48:30.774 --> 48:31.474
Uh!

48:50.560 --> 48:51.260
Ah!

49:07.210 --> 49:09.145
Baker residence,
may I ask who's calling?

49:09.146 --> 49:10.406
Sweetheart, it's mom.

49:10.814 --> 49:11.514
Wow!

49:12.783 --> 49:13.483
Who it is?

49:14.284 --> 49:15.985
You know darn well who this is.

49:15.986 --> 49:17.246
Quite goofing around.

49:20.357 --> 49:21.057
Ugh.

49:21.825 --> 49:22.845
Don't you ugh me.

49:23.193 --> 49:24.813
My minutes are running out.

49:26.096 --> 49:26.936
Adam speaking.

49:27.197 --> 49:28.464
I know who's speaking.

49:28.465 --> 49:29.899
What's going on over there?

49:29.900 --> 49:31.220
Oh, dear mother, oh...

49:31.401 --> 49:32.361
You sound weird.

49:32.469 --> 49:33.736
You must detect
the joy in my voice,

49:33.737 --> 49:36.238
but rest assured there's nothing
to worry about here.

49:36.239 --> 49:37.273
Everything here is just...

49:37.274 --> 49:37.974
No!

49:38.408 --> 49:39.728
blessed and wonderful.

49:39.977 --> 49:40.677
Okay.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.411
What's going on over there?

49:42.412 --> 49:43.192
Go for Baker.

49:43.580 --> 49:45.740
Adam Baker,
you put your Uncle M...

49:46.717 --> 49:47.417
Down.

49:47.718 --> 49:48.284
Put it down.

49:48.285 --> 49:48.985
Who's that?

49:49.119 --> 49:49.899

51:52.811 --> 51:53.476
Ow!

51:53.477 --> 51:54.257
Are you okay?

51:54.911 --> 51:55.611
Yeah.

51:56.580 --> 51:58.200
I don't know what happened.

52:01.251 --> 52:01.971
Nice shades.

52:02.486 --> 52:03.186
Uh.

52:04.221 --> 52:07.356
Yeah, I don't know, I was
just trying out a new look.

52:07.357 --> 52:08.197
Yeah, my look.

52:09.226 --> 52:11.327
Are you supposed to dropping
off Gillian at soccer practice?

52:11.328 --> 52:12.408
It's already done,

52:12.762 --> 52:15.131
so I thought I'd swing by
the park and do lunch with Lori.

52:15.132 --> 52:15.832
No!

52:16.366 --> 52:17.866
I mean, she's busy today.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.635
Tonight's the fundraiser,
and she has to go over

52:19.636 --> 52:20.936
some last-minute things
with Vance.

52:20.937 --> 52:21.637
Ugh!

52:21.972 --> 52:23.906
Oh, oh, oh, wait,
Handsome and Lori together?

52:23.907 --> 52:26.727
Ah, he's trying to get
in between me and Lori.

52:27.410 --> 52:28.190
Lori and you?

52:29.446 --> 52:30.466
I mean, uh... we.

52:32.015 --> 52:34.235
Okay, well, we only
have a few hours

52:34.251 --> 52:35.718
until the Splash-apalooza.

52:35.719 --> 52:36.919
There's a lot to do.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.188
And, plus, Uncle Mitch told me
that I have to help him

52:39.189 --> 52:40.789
with this birthday party thing.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.725
Okay, I guess I'll just
round up the boys

52:42.726 --> 52:44.326
and take care of Handsome
once and for all.

52:44.327 --> 52:45.661
No, just leave it alone.

52:45.662 --> 52:46.622
That's an order.

52:50.100 --> 52:51.480
Whatever you say, boss.

53:14.858 --> 53:15.558
Pfllt.

53:23.066 --> 53:23.766
Baker.

53:30.106 --> 53:31.366
There you are, Baker.

53:32.342 --> 53:33.242
Perfect timing.

53:33.743 --> 53:34.763
You can say that.

53:35.378 --> 53:36.278
I need to speak

53:36.646 --> 53:39.226
to the Splash-apalooza
planning committee.

53:39.616 --> 53:40.649
Where's the other half?

53:40.650 --> 53:41.951
Yeah, she's not coming.

53:41.952 --> 53:43.786
And if you want to talk to Lori,

53:43.787 --> 53:46.155
you're gonna
have to go through me first.

53:46.156 --> 53:47.536
Give me a break, Baker.

53:48.291 --> 53:49.611
I'm finished with you.

53:49.859 --> 53:50.559
Done-so.

53:50.927 --> 53:52.962
And the only thing I want
for you to do is walk

53:52.963 --> 53:56.365
right over to Mr. Mattis' office
and turn in your whistle.

53:56.366 --> 53:57.733
And why would I do that?

53:57.734 --> 53:59.401
Because if you don't,
you'll have to explain

53:59.402 --> 54:02.571
to Lori and everyone else why
Vance Vance Revolution

54:02.572 --> 54:04.912
isn't playing Splash-apalooza
tonight.

54:07.544 --> 54:08.504
What's so funny?

54:09.012 --> 54:11.113
You obviously don't realize
who you're dealing with, Vance.

54:11.114 --> 54:11.814
Oh, yeah?

54:12.582 --> 54:14.322
Tell me, who exactly is that?

54:17.120 --> 54:17.820
All of us.

54:19.489 --> 54:20.209
Or everyone.

54:25.161 --> 54:25.861
Oh, hey!

54:27.464 --> 54:28.164
Uh!

54:31.126 --> 54:31.826
You.

54:38.041 --> 54:39.061
We're everywhere.

54:56.226 --> 54:57.006
Party! Party!

54:59.429 --> 55:00.129
Oh, yeah!

55:08.338 --> 55:09.038
Oh, Vance!

55:14.944 --> 55:15.644
Ah!

55:24.988 --> 55:26.788
This is my park now, Handsome.

55:28.091 --> 55:30.251
And you're gonna
stay away from it.

55:30.727 --> 55:33.907
Because we'll be watching
everything and everywhere.

55:36.299 --> 55:36.999
Got it?

55:48.111 --> 55:48.811
Ah!

55:54.284 --> 55:54.984
Bye.

55:56.325 --> 55:57.285
What's going on?

55:57.287 --> 55:58.787
Where's Adam numbero uno?

55:59.689 --> 56:01.189
What, are you his mother?

56:01.324 --> 56:02.424
No, I'm his best friend.

56:02.425 --> 56:03.445
Oh, yeah, really?

56:03.727 --> 56:04.447
Best friend?

56:04.894 --> 56:06.934
Then why did he
put me in charge?

56:07.831 --> 56:09.271
Where is Handsome going?

56:09.866 --> 56:11.433
He had better
get back here pronto.

56:11.434 --> 56:13.068
He has a show to play tonight.

56:13.069 --> 56:15.804
Oh, yeah, he's not
gonna be coming back ever.

56:15.805 --> 56:17.039
What do you mean? Why?

56:17.040 --> 56:19.541
He told me he was gonna work
for Water Planet.

56:19.542 --> 56:20.922
That conniving traitor.

56:21.444 --> 56:24.079
Yo know how life or death
this fundraiser is.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.880
How could you let this happen?

56:26.149 --> 56:26.929
I don't know.

56:27.283 --> 56:28.723
I mean... by not caring.

56:29.052 --> 56:30.753
Uh, Mr. Mattis,
you'll have to forgive Adam.

56:30.754 --> 56:32.494
He's not quite himself today.

56:33.022 --> 56:33.722
Yeah?

56:34.357 --> 56:37.159
Well, he's got three hours
to find me another headliner

56:37.160 --> 56:38.000
or he's fired.

56:38.428 --> 56:39.561
What? You can't fire me.

56:39.562 --> 56:40.762
I'm your accountant.

56:40.997 --> 56:42.437
Okay, then you're fired.

56:43.133 --> 56:43.833
What?

56:44.134 --> 56:44.834
He's fired.

56:45.368 --> 56:48.788
And if you don't find me
another headliner, you're next.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.106
Boom!

57:03.153 --> 57:05.373
See, I told you
cleaning can be fun.

57:12.796 --> 57:14.716
And disgusting at the same time.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.132
Ugh!

57:18.668 --> 57:19.368
Mm.

57:43.626 --> 57:44.326
Alakazoo!

57:57.240 --> 57:58.380
We love you, Mitch!

57:59.476 --> 58:00.776
That was great, Uncle Mitch.

58:00.777 --> 58:01.617
I know, right?

58:02.545 --> 58:05.714
No better feeling than showing
someone that the impossible

58:05.715 --> 58:06.855
is indeed possible,

58:07.617 --> 58:10.185
What you said last
week was a game changer.

58:10.186 --> 58:10.906
I said that?

58:12.222 --> 58:14.202
I sa... I said that... I said it.

58:15.525 --> 58:16.625
I wasted all that time
trying to be

58:16.626 --> 58:18.846
like every other magician
out there.

58:19.262 --> 58:22.262
But what makes me different,
makes me happy is...

58:22.765 --> 58:23.765
you know, like we said.

58:23.766 --> 58:24.466
Oh.

58:24.634 --> 58:25.133
What did we say?

58:25.134 --> 58:25.974
What did we...

58:26.069 --> 58:27.236
- Being...
- Being...

58:27.237 --> 58:29.097
- ...the best...
- The best...

58:29.272 --> 58:30.832
- ...magic...
- Magician.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.108
- ...Magic Mitch...
- ...Magic Mitch...

58:33.109 --> 58:34.549
- ...I can.
- ...I can.

58:35.011 --> 58:36.912
Being the best magician
I can be.

58:36.913 --> 58:37.813
Yes, I said it.

58:40.484 --> 58:41.183
Right.

58:41.184 --> 58:42.084
Truth. Honesty.

58:43.186 --> 58:44.326
Being the real you.

58:44.754 --> 58:46.314
That's where the magic is.

58:46.322 --> 58:48.002
Otherwise, what's the point?

58:49.592 --> 58:50.612
Hey, what's that?

58:52.095 --> 58:53.715
Oh, yeah, it's just a rash.

58:54.597 --> 58:57.299
I mean, probably from all that
chlorine in those pools.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.801
You should probably
get that checked out... not yet.

58:59.802 --> 59:01.062
This show ain't over.

59:01.304 --> 59:03.884
We still gotta make
that grandma reappear.

59:04.707 --> 59:05.407
Mm-hmm.

59:05.742 --> 59:06.582
Pretty rabbit.

59:10.813 --> 59:12.193
Uh, I'll be right back.

59:12.615 --> 59:15.255
I think I turned
the grandma into a rabbit.

59:25.028 --> 59:27.729
Vance won't be giving us
any problems from here on out.

59:27.730 --> 59:30.850
Right now, Vance is
the very least of our problems.

59:37.140 --> 59:37.840
Finally!

59:38.408 --> 59:39.441
Where have you been?

59:39.442 --> 59:41.062
Uh, magic show, long story.

59:41.544 --> 59:43.644
You remember
my Uncle Magic Mitch?

59:43.846 --> 59:44.806
Straight jacket?

59:45.348 --> 59:46.488
This is some venue.

59:47.283 --> 59:47.983
Whoa, yeah.

59:49.124 --> 59:49.964
Where's Vance?

59:50.119 --> 59:51.119
Shouldn't he be setting up?

59:51.120 --> 59:52.120
That's what I've
been calling about.

59:52.121 --> 59:53.201
There is no Vance.

59:53.489 --> 59:55.691
He just freaked out,
I don't know why.

59:55.692 --> 59:58.193
No, he's probably just taking
selfies and then liking them.

59:58.194 --> 01:00:00.354
No, I mean, he's gone,
melted down,

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.230
as in not coming back... ever.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:05.467
Perfect.

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:07.089
Far from it.

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.605
If we don't find someone
to take Vance's place,

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.473
there's not gonna be
a Splash-apalooza.

01:00:11.474 --> 01:00:12.741
And if there's
no Splash-apalooza,

01:00:12.742 --> 01:00:14.476
there's not gonna be
a water park next summer.

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:16.697
Mattis was so mad,
he fired Sheldon.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:18.526
Oh my gosh, no way, no.

01:00:18.877 --> 01:00:19.657
Why, Sheldon?

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.896
He loves that job.

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:22.317
We need something big.

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.398
Something amazing.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.007
Something...

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.488
Yeah!

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.789
♪ Oh... ♪

01:00:27.857 --> 01:00:28.557
Magical.

01:00:30.393 --> 01:00:32.853
Does he do something
other than sparkle?

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:33.855
You bet he does.

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:35.731
I think.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:38.467
This is gonna be great.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:39.601
I have so many ideas.

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.837
Come on, come on, come on,
let's do this.

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:42.538
Oh, yeah!

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.232
It's magic hour!

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:45.474
Let's go!

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.055
Yes, yes, yes,
let's go, Uncle Mitch.

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:58.554
What?

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.058
Looks like it's been hit by...

01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:03.779
A clone-ado.

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:08.075
Uh, I mean,
like a... like a cyclone.

01:01:23.813 --> 01:01:24.513
What?

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:36.558
Hold on.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:48.737
Huh?

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:53.575
Ow! What the...

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:55.844
Adam, are you okay in there?

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.065
Yeah, it's just
some stomach issues.

01:01:59.315 --> 01:02:02.315
You've gotta stop eating
those son of tuna melts.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:03.018
Brutal.

01:02:03.619 --> 01:02:06.319
I tried to stop him,
but he was too perfect.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.296
Plus his hair's breathtaking.

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.344
I was mesmerized.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:10.626
He's mad.

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:12.427
You need to protect Lori.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.871
You do not want to go in there.

01:02:22.872 --> 01:02:26.112
I'm telling you, there's
some serious toilet suction.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.780
Should I be worried?

01:02:31.881 --> 01:02:32.581
Uh, no, no.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.836
It's just... uh, mice.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.890
Big mice.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:42.971
We should go.

01:02:45.895 --> 01:02:46.595
Adam!

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:47.856
What's going on?

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.217
Well just... stay here,
the llama will protect you.

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:56.438
Help!

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.260
I need a little help here, dude.

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.008
Party foul.

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.113
He over-powdered me.

01:03:05.815 --> 01:03:06.515
Perfect?

01:03:07.016 --> 01:03:07.716
Totally.

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:13.628
Oh, oh, Adam, Adam.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:15.210
Where is he?

01:03:15.725 --> 01:03:17.592
He took off
after I showed him the video.

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:19.213
Adam, you need to see this.

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:23.157
Adam, are you coming back?

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.987
Hang on, I'll be back.

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:27.556
I'll be right in.

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:30.377
And I thought
my house was messy.

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:33.068
Yum, gummy bear.

01:03:33.179 --> 01:03:33.879
Ha-ha!

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:38.447
Lori!

01:03:40.248 --> 01:03:40.948
Hey!

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.084
I have to get you out of here.

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.465
Adam, there was a hand.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:45.954
Oh, a hand?

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.309
Oh, those mice must be evolving.

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.278
We have to hurry.

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.561
Look, Adam!

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:54.496
What up?

01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:57.132
It's Lori.

01:03:58.167 --> 01:03:58.867
Hey.

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:01.269
Oh, no, it's okay,
it's okay, they won't hurt you.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:02.270
They're... they're with me.

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:03.351
They're... well...

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:06.174
Nice to meet your acquaintance.

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:07.255
They're my clones.

01:04:09.111 --> 01:04:09.811
Clones?

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.081
But that's not real,
except in sci-fi movies.

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:16.418
I know it's hard to believe,
but there was this machine.

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:18.086
And my schedule was like crazy...

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:20.522
Oh, wait, you mean
you did this yourself?

01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:22.683
No, it was
an accident... at first.

01:04:26.229 --> 01:04:29.197
But instead you lied
and then let them run around

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.458
pretending to be you?

01:04:32.335 --> 01:04:33.035
You!

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.383
You smashed cake in my face.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:40.032
And you, you read me poetry
and then gave me food poisoning.

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:44.704
And you, you just need to do
everyone a favor

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:46.848
and get that thing waxed!

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:52.187
And you.

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.375
You made a fool of me.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:58.211
All this time, like... like
I was some game to you.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.302
And to think, I
thought you were different.

01:05:06.535 --> 01:05:07.235
Lori, wait.

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.265
I know I've been an idiot.

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:13.388
I was scared.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.745
Scared I wouldn't
say the right thing

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.486
or, you know, be cool enough.

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:23.696
Thanks to you, you showed me
that the real Adam

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.455
might not be so bad after all.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.092
If you just give me
one more chance,

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:34.873
I promise I'll never pretend to
be someone I'm not ever again.

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:39.058
I just... I... I really wanted
to im... to impress you.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:40.902
Adam!

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:41.937
Uh!

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:43.478
I gotcha, I gotcha.

01:05:43.739 --> 01:05:45.839
Hurry, let's get him
to the couch.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.720
Are you okay?

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.799
Yeah, I think so.

01:05:51.814 --> 01:05:53.481
I don't know what's going on.

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:54.616
It's the machine, Adam.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.017
That's what
I've been trying to tell you.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:56.718
Here.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:01.056
It's been 67 hours since
the last duplicate was created.

01:06:01.057 --> 01:06:03.637
Each copy has manifested
different traits.

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:07.783
Exhibit one.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:11.787
Exhibit two.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:18.825
Each clone exhibits
a shared sense of feeling.

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:20.495
Even shared pain.

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:21.843
No way!

01:06:23.079 --> 01:06:23.779
Ah!

01:06:29.785 --> 01:06:32.215
Scientific research, don't
you think, boys and girls?

01:06:32.216 --> 01:06:33.154
That's not the part.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:33.855
Here.

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:37.264
Mysterious side effects
have surfaced.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.574
The headaches,
the sweating and dizziness.

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.231
And now a rash.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:46.368
Oh, nasty.

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:49.597
If my analysis is correct,

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.676
complete bodily disintegration
will occur just eight hours

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:56.811
after the initial onset
of these symptoms.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:06:59.992
Further, each of my copies
will suffer the same fate

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.436
shortly after my own expiration.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:11.964
The only way to stop the cycle
is with the duplex ignitor.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.950
Inserting the duplex ignitor in
reverse position creates

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:22.301
a protonic window through which
each clone can be sent

01:07:23.005 --> 01:07:24.805
back into the initial subject.

01:07:25.107 --> 01:07:28.109
To do this, each clone must
travel into the machine

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:31.230
at a high speed, at no less
than 37 miles per hour.

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.401
That's good.
We should do that.

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.770
This is our only hope.

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:42.221
Professor Loin signing off
possibly for the last time.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:51.099
Van's packed,
let's get this show...

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:51.820
Uncle Mitch.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:52.801
road.

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:55.944
I can explain.

01:07:56.372 --> 01:07:57.992
Nephew, what have you done?

01:08:01.477 --> 01:08:02.177
Busted.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.028
This is brilliant.

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.183
What?

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:10.164
We can use them in the show.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:12.720
Yeah,
we can rage the magic show!

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:14.281
We're gonna magic history.

01:08:14.457 --> 01:08:15.157
What?

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:17.258
No, no, no, no, Uncle Mitch,
it's too dangerous.

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:19.928
We have to get them back
in the tanning bed thing.

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.689
Or the cloning machine
thing... I don't know.

01:08:23.232 --> 01:08:23.952
Tanning bed?

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:26.647
Uh, that might be a problem.

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:32.174
What?

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:34.082
What happened?

01:08:35.044 --> 01:08:36.678
It was like this when I came in.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:40.459
I thought Gillian had practiced
her karate on it or something.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:41.897
We'll fix it.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.298
We'll make a plan.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.053
He can't get away with this.

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:46.434
You're not alone, Adam.

01:08:46.654 --> 01:08:48.154
There's just one problem.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.545
The duplex ignitor is gone.

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.769
St importantly,
we get the duplex ignitor back.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:05.609
And Uncle Mitch, you can still
save the park with a great show.

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:06.640
Oh.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:07.509
Yes!

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:08.470
All right, guys,

01:09:08.743 --> 01:09:09.743
we're all gonna be needed
for the trick here.

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:10.444
Mm-hmm.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:11.379
Yeah.

01:09:12.081 --> 01:09:12.781
Wait.

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:15.617
I can't do the show without her.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.118
She's my good luck charm.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:19.567
Now why the slide?

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:21.823
Because the professor said
that all the clones

01:09:21.823 --> 01:09:24.425
are gonna need to be traveling
at least 37 miles an hour

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:26.946
to breech the energy field's
outer shell.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.063
Yeah.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.064
That'... that's it, yeah.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.600
And before we take
the plunge, we're gonna need

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.541
the duplex ignitor,
which of course Perfect has.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.037
How do we know
he'll even show up?

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:39.073
I know.

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:41.176
I can text him
to meet me at the show.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:42.077
It should work.

01:09:42.178 --> 01:09:43.444
He took my phone
a long time ago.

01:09:43.444 --> 01:09:44.712
He'll know it's a trick.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:45.712
It doesn't matter.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.234
Lori's his... well,
also our... weakness.

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:51.426
It's too dangerous.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.056
Look at what he did
to the machine.

01:09:55.057 --> 01:09:56.677
He's... he's unpredictable.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:09:59.066
You're in trouble, Adam.

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:00.882
And I wanna help.

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.665
It's just part
of my lifeguard nature.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.166
And what about the Clone 2000?

01:10:05.167 --> 01:10:07.468
Even if we get the duplex
ignitor from Perfect,

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:10.169
it's not gonna do us
any good in this shape.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:14.809
Danny?

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:16.557
Sheldon? You came, too!

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.581
I figured you weren't
talking to me since...

01:10:19.582 --> 01:10:20.648
I kind of got you fired.

01:10:20.649 --> 01:10:21.849
None of that matters right now.

01:10:21.850 --> 01:10:24.490
You're in trouble,
and we're your wing men.

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:26.554
Plus, we helped
create this mess, too.

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:27.335
Word to that.

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.712
So... you think
you can fix it?

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.296
Uh, yeah.

01:10:35.965 --> 01:10:38.199
But it's gonna take
a lot of duct tape...

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.120
and technical genius, of course.

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.103
All right, we gotta go.

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.538
The show starts
in a couple of hours.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.106
We'll load the machine
into the van.

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:47.927
You guys gotta get it
running during the show.

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:49.844
Show time, whoo-hoo!

01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:00.421
Oh, my goodness gracious,
that was awesome sauce, Todd.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:01.122
Thank you.

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:05.304
Let's give it up for the guy
who stacked a bunch of cups.

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.824
Uncle Mitch, why are you hiding?

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.481
Listen to 'em.

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.644
They think they're gonna see
some young rock star.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.525
But you're like
hashtag greatest magician ever.

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:28.249
Just pretend like you're doing
the trick only for me,

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.630
just like we practiced.

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:33.468
You're right.

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.499
We've got magic to make.

01:11:41.196 --> 01:11:43.716
Oh, um... due
to unforeseen circumstances

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:48.836
that were neither unforeseen
nor circumstantial,

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.937
the role of
Vance Vance Revolution

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:54.793
in tonight's performance will be
played by a great performer.

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.391
Vance! Vance!
Vance! Vance!

01:11:57.613 --> 01:11:59.314
Straight off
his one-week stint

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:02.675
at the Beachwood Retirement
Home, please put your hands

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.058
together for the one,
the only...

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:08.410

Yeah, let's get the party
started!

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:56.397
Five!

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.268
Yes!

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.314
Magic Mitch!

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:28.149
I gotta go, excuse me.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:28.930
Okay.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.094
We did it! We did it!

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.682
Thank you so much.

01:14:37.003 --> 01:14:37.703
Thank you.

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.906
Every dollar counts.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.342
What do I have to do to get
you back here next summer?

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:42.183
Lots of money.

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.211
Lori!

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:44.619
There you are.

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:46.981
Uncle Mitch did it.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.302
You guys were amazing.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.678
Mattis is going nuts.

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:52.887
You've changed already.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.255
Yeah, I gotta
get you out of here.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:54.956
What? Why?

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:56.764
I'll explain on the way.

01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:59.327
Adam, where are we going?

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:00.528
What about our plan?

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.928
There's been a change in plans.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.104
Ah!

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:18.779
Oh, there's the man of the hour.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.920
Amazing job, Baker.

01:15:19.982 --> 01:15:21.352
It looks like you
really did save the park.

01:15:21.353 --> 01:15:22.053
Thanks.

01:15:22.251 --> 01:15:23.017
Have you seen Lori?

01:15:23.018 --> 01:15:24.218
Uh, she was just with you.

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:26.020
You were walking
towards the exit.

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:26.721
What?

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:30.549
Oh, Baker... Baker,
come on, how'd you do it?

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:31.959
Huh, it was mirrors, right?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.220
It had to be mirrors.

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:34.128
Clones.

01:15:36.001 --> 01:15:36.697
Clones?

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:37.478
That's funny.

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:39.626
Boy, if that was possible, huh?

01:15:42.004 --> 01:15:45.406
Do me a favor, make that out
to Ms. Penny Pants, will ya?

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:46.967
Gillian, Gillian, Gillian.

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:48.476
You have to kick me.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:49.344
Okay, sure.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:51.115
Ah!

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:51.746
Oh!

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:52.447
Oooh!

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.981
Baker, what's the matter
with you?

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:55.783
Ah!

01:15:58.687 --> 01:15:59.387
Ah!

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:00.822
Ah!

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.010
Oh, that was seriously low.

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.585
He just wants to get rid of me.

01:16:06.528 --> 01:16:09.648
Adam doesn't deserve you,
Lori, you belong with me.

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:12.133
No!

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:13.834
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:16:13.835 --> 01:16:14.535
Yes, I do.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.106
What?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:18.940
No, no.

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:20.875
Oh.

01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:22.076
Ah.

01:16:23.445 --> 01:16:24.405
Guys, he's here.

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.014
And Lori's leading him
to the top of the slide.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.035
Be careful, Adam.

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.687
Guys, we're out of time.

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:34.755
We gotta get that thing
working now.

01:16:34.756 --> 01:16:35.456
Uh.

01:16:35.757 --> 01:16:36.457
Copy that.

01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:39.160
Oh.

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.483
Well, well, well.

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.985
If it isn't Adam Baker...
all by his lonesome.

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:48.936
You think you pulled off
your little magic act?

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:49.937
Vance, I don't
have time for this.

01:16:49.938 --> 01:16:51.318
This is my park, Baker.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.576
You think I'm gonna let you
and your gang of robo Adams

01:16:55.577 --> 01:16:56.417
scare me away?

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:57.812
Hear me?

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:03.884
How are we doing down there?

01:17:03.885 --> 01:17:04.845
We're not ready.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:06.520
She's gotta stall him.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:07.721
You gotta stall him.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:09.891
Ah!

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.466
You disappoint me, Lori.

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:16.054
Adam thinks if he can get rid
of me and the rest of us,

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:17.498
then you'll finally
settle for him.

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:18.879
I wouldn't be settling.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.487
The real Adam's great
just the way he is.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:23.657
Yeah, you didn't think that

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:25.706
until we brought him
to your attention.

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:27.747
I guess I needed
to open my eyes.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:28.943
Uh.

01:17:30.712 --> 01:17:31.492
Give me that.

01:17:39.788 --> 01:17:40.488
Adam!

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:41.489
Help!

01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.530
Lori, hang on!

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:43.764
Wait a minute.

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.360
That's the guy
I should be fighting.

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:47.201
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.336
Come on, we have to save her.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.560
I can't hold on!

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:54.335
Ah!

01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.807
Here, just give me that ignitor

01:17:59.808 --> 01:18:01.776
and I'll pull you
right up, okay?

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:02.477
No way!

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:06.559
You choose
the wrong Adam once, Lori.

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:08.649
Don't do it again,
just give me the ignitor.

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:09.350
Come on.

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:10.818
I'm gonna fall!

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:13.106
I can't... I can't hold on!

01:18:17.592 --> 01:18:18.726
Come on, let's go, let's go!

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:19.447
Yeah, right.

01:18:20.862 --> 01:18:22.902
That's, uh,
really high up there.

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:25.933
Maybe you should
take this one, bro.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:26.634
What?

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:28.122
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.570
I got a... I got
a thing about heights.

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:34.339
It's embarrassing but... nobody's
perfect after all, right?

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:37.485
Go 'em, Baker!

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:40.995
You got this, man!

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:43.416
This is all you!
Here you go!

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.638
Two more flights!

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.321
Come on, just give me your hand.

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:48.322
Okay, you're gonna
be there all day

01:18:48.323 --> 01:18:50.183
if you don't give me your hand.

01:18:50.364 --> 01:18:51.158
All right, that's it!

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.599
There you go, that's it!

01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:55.563
If you don't give me your hand...

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.264
Ow!

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.216
I'm not going back.

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:11.412
This should be my life,
not yours.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:12.373
It is your life.

01:19:12.447 --> 01:19:13.227
We're a team.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:14.615
Adam!

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.350
Just go, I got this.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:30.298
Got it!

01:19:30.929 --> 01:19:31.629
Nice catch!

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.466
Now fire it up.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:33.167
Hurry!

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:42.169
You're on, Adam!

01:19:54.022 --> 01:19:54.722
Ah!

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:06.667
What?

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:07.768
How'd you do that?

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:08.469
Yah!

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:09.937
Ah!

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:15.596
- Ah!
- Ah!

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.139
Why'd I do that?

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.048
On guard, geek.

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:36.750
We're good to go.

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:53.779
It's working,
and it hasn't exploded... yet.

01:20:54.549 --> 01:20:55.389
Come on, Adam!

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.030
I know you can do this!

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.655
Uh, you're holding me back.

01:21:01.656 --> 01:21:02.756
I don't wanna fight you.

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:03.897
Good. Just give up.

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:05.693
Ugh!

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:08.262
There.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:09.564
Ah!

01:21:15.737 --> 01:21:16.437
Hold on!

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:23.417
Hold on, I got you!

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:24.918
What are you doing?

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.733
I would've never saved you.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.329
Yeah, I know.

01:21:33.455 --> 01:21:34.155
What?

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:36.724
No...!

01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:47.501
It worked!

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:49.670
Sorry.

01:21:50.772 --> 01:21:51.792
Nobody's perfect.

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:55.882
Oh, no, you gotta be kidding.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.580
Uh!

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:14.868
Adam, give me your hand.

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:20.267
Pull!

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.710
Ha-ha, way to go, Bakers!

01:22:29.711 --> 01:22:30.411
Nice save!

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:35.916
Uh, okay.

01:22:36.751 --> 01:22:37.451
Okay.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.122
That's a... ribs breaking.

01:22:39.123 --> 01:22:39.963
Ribs breaking.

01:22:39.988 --> 01:22:41.008
That's too tight.

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:42.576
Thanks, bud.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:43.924
Good boy.

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.495
Okay, that was hard.

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:53.000
I thank you guys all enough
for all you've done for me.

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:53.701
Seriously.

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.235
Not for you, for us.

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.592
Well... I guess this is it.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:08.133
Just promise me you read
a book every once in a while...

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:10.264
in between comics.

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.212
This is for you.

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:19.479
And write some poetry.

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:21.262
Trust me.

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:23.564
See ya.

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:48.361
That's not what that is.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:50.558
Never mind.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:52.393
Thanks.

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:53.627
Huh?

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.266
Ooh.

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:15.683
Ah!

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:26.947
Hug it out, brah.

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:30.998
Thanks for teaching me
how to have fun, man.

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.319
Word to that, A Prime.

01:24:32.667 --> 01:24:33.447
Word to that.

01:24:34.202 --> 01:24:34.902
Ah!

01:24:36.304 --> 01:24:37.004
Whoo!

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:42.489
I'm gonna go.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:43.410
All right.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:44.651
Keep it real, brah!

01:24:46.815 --> 01:24:47.535
Gotta split!

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.350
Whoo!

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.030
I think I'm gonna miss you
most of all.

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.806
I'm not going anywhere, Adam.

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:09.421
We'll be right here
whenever you need us.

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.806
Separately, we're pretty good.

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.809
But together, we totally rock.

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.702
Just try not to forget
we're there, all right?

01:25:24.619 --> 01:25:25.319
Never.

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.075
Look on the bright side.

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.876
They didn't go very far.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:18.525
And... I'm still here.

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.303
I mean, I feel
different... better.

01:26:26.648 --> 01:26:29.650
They showed me there was more
to Adam Baker than I even knew.

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:32.831
Adam, there is one more thing
I really have to know.

01:26:39.294 --> 01:26:40.014
I was right.

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:42.595
Some things really
can be perfect.

01:26:56.878 --> 01:26:57.578
No, no, no!

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:00.874
That was not a dream!

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:02.856
No, that wasn't a dream.

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:04.952
What?

01:27:05.386 --> 01:27:06.086
No.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.694
No, no, you cannot
do this to me.

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.503
It was real, I felt it.

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:18.499
Hi, kids!

01:27:19.467 --> 01:27:20.787
Hey, guys, we're home.

01:27:21.970 --> 01:27:23.110
Adam, where are ya?

01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:25.606
It's neat.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:28.609
Too neat.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:31.078
How can something be too neat?

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:32.459
I'm a mother, trust me.

01:27:35.882 --> 01:27:36.722
There you are.

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:37.551
Hey.

01:27:37.885 --> 01:27:38.585
Hey?

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:39.787
That's it?

01:27:40.855 --> 01:27:41.989
Well, have you ever had
something

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:45.110
so amazingly great happen
that... you kinda thought

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:48.180
that it might not
have actually happened?

01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:49.729
When we had you, sweetie.

01:27:49.931 --> 01:27:50.631
Mwah.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.667
Oh, your Uncle Mitch
is in the driveway.

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.108
He wants to say goodbye.

01:27:55.203 --> 01:27:55.903
Goodbye?

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:01.642
Oh!

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.613
Hey, Uncle Mitch,
where are you going?

01:28:06.614 --> 01:28:07.334
Vegas, baby.

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:09.950
A video of the show went viral.

01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.951
Hashtag Magic Mitch
is trending through the roof!

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.889
I got my magic mojo back
thanks to you.

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:18.170
Or should I say
thanks to all of you.

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.822
Well you're
a pretty awesome uncle.

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.197
Thanks for saving my butt
back there

01:28:24.198 --> 01:28:25.198
before mom and dad came home.

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:25.899
No problem.

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.601
And cleaned up that mess.

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.982
That's some real magic.

01:28:33.207 --> 01:28:34.347
I'm gonna miss you.

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:37.544
I promised your boss that I'd be
back for an encore appearance

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:38.325
every summer.

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.246
Whoa!

01:28:39.814 --> 01:28:41.494
Oh, I got something for you.

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:48.856
Whoa!

01:28:49.957 --> 01:28:50.957
For your safe keeping.

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:51.658
Whoa.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.860
If it were to get
into the wrong hands...

01:28:53.861 --> 01:28:55.829
nah, I don't wanna think
about that.

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:58.065
I've got the actual
tanning bed in my van.

01:28:58.066 --> 01:29:00.267
Gotta keep this puppy
bronzed after all.

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.548
Well, don't
worry, I'll keep it safe.

01:29:03.469 --> 01:29:04.438
Thanks, Uncle Mitch.

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:05.139
All right.

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:08.995
Farewell, nephew.

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:11.391
Stay magical.

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:12.346
All right.

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:21.988
I thought you were
at work today.

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:23.657
Mattis was so thrilled
with the fundraiser,

01:29:23.658 --> 01:29:25.025
he gave me the day off.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:27.394
Oh, and they had to put
a new plaque on the trophy

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:29.396
with your name
over one of Vance's.

01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:30.597
I bet he loved that.

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:33.199
I think it was his idea,
actually.

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:35.435
Oh, and Sheldon
got his job back.

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:36.816
No way, that's awesome.

01:29:36.838 --> 01:29:38.705
I was thinking
about hitting the park.

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:39.486
You got time?

01:29:40.808 --> 01:29:42.548
I've always got time for you.

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:45.879
And so what do you
wanna hit first?

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.014
Uh, it's your
turn to hit Plank Plunge.

01:29:48.015 --> 01:29:49.649
I think I've spent
enough time over there.

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:50.490
Yeah, me, too.

01:29:51.719 --> 01:29:53.253
How 'bout the kiddie pool?

01:29:53.254 --> 01:29:53.954
Ew!

01:29:55.523 --> 01:29:57.190
Hey, sweetie, did you miss us?

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:57.891
Hi, daddy.

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.256
Hashtag sisters.

01:30:12.874 --> 01:30:13.574
Ha!

01:30:17.979 --> 01:30:19.239
Honey, where are you?

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:21.701
There's a llama in the backyard.

01:30:22.183 --> 01:30:23.323
How many are there?

01:30:24.783 --> 01:30:26.003
The End

01:30:26.183 --> 01:30:30.183
