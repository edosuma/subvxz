WEBVTT

00:20.020 --> 00:21.271
<i>Previously on </i>Manifest…

00:21.354 --> 00:23.648
The state legally declared Eden deceased.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.067
Angelina and Eden's prints
were found on that bridge.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.902
They found her backpack in the Narrows.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.071
Yeah, but no bodies. Why no bodies?

00:30.155 --> 00:32.032
I won't stop. I can't.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.116
Mind if I try something?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.329
Erika Burness.
She held up a gun store

00:38.413 --> 00:39.748
with her boyfriend, Randall Barr.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.667
ULF is emitted by earthquakes.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.087
But earthquakes aren't causing
the frequency spikes. So what is?

00:46.171 --> 00:49.257
We're connected.
If you're my guardian angel, show me.

00:49.340 --> 00:50.550
This is our trial by fire.

00:50.633 --> 00:51.468
Signs and wonders.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.845
-Why do you keep saying that?
-Matthew 24:24.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.973
"False prophets will arise from the dead
to perform signs and wonders."

00:57.057 --> 00:59.684
You told me to get my guardian angel.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.686
And you were right. I needed Eden.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.229
She called you to save us.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.106
Help me. Please, Adrian.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.489
-What time is it?

01:12.572 --> 01:14.616
Way too late for someone
to be banging down the door.

01:14.699 --> 01:15.784
Oh. Hey.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.787
-Where's Ben?
-Nice to see you too, Vance.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.372
-Thanks for stopping by at this hour.
-What's up?

01:21.456 --> 01:24.793
I brokered a deal to get Eagan released
if he gave up Eden's location.

01:24.876 --> 01:28.963
I was supposed to meet Ben at the address,
but your brother gave me the slip.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.466
-What's going on?
-Dad knows where Eden is?

01:32.550 --> 01:33.676
He didn't tell you.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.055
Ben is gonna get himself killed
going wherever he went alone.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.641
-Okay. How long ago was this?
-Two hours.

01:39.724 --> 01:40.850
-Let's hit the attic.
-Yeah.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.528
I thought my teenagers were messy,
but this is…

01:53.738 --> 01:54.823
Who knows the password?

01:55.532 --> 01:56.574
Let me try.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.167
I might know it.

02:10.713 --> 02:11.965
What was the code?

02:12.715 --> 02:13.800
Eden's birthday.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.302
Okay, there's nothing
in his outgoing mail…

02:18.263 --> 02:19.681
…and his search history's wiped.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.558
Phone's going straight to voice mail.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.227
And it's right here.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.022
-Bastard called me on a burner.
-Yeah. Well, you taught him well.

02:28.106 --> 02:31.067
Now, what do we do?
Okay, how do we find Dad?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.736
The only one who knows
where to find Ben is Eagan,

02:33.820 --> 02:35.363
and he's not gonna tell me shit.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.616
-I'll go first thing.
-I'll come with.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.786
No, your patients need you.
I can… I can handle Eagan.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.538
So just sit here and worry?

02:43.621 --> 02:44.998
We all should worry.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.252
There's no way this ends well.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.575
To what do I owe the pleasure,
Detective Vasquez?

03:21.159 --> 03:23.411
-I'm looking for Erika Burness.
-Erika?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.747
Join us, please.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.417
Can I help you?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.378
Yeah. Recently, you purchased
a rather large bulk of fertilizer.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.547
200 pounds, to be exact.

03:34.631 --> 03:38.218
That amount triggers suspicion.
It's not exactly planting season out here.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.805
Fertilizer's cheaper in the winter.
We needed to stock our greenhouse.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.352
-You mind if I take a look?
-Be our guest.

03:56.611 --> 03:57.654
Help!

03:59.572 --> 04:00.782
Help me!

04:10.083 --> 04:11.251
Help me!

04:15.797 --> 04:16.631
Help!

04:18.758 --> 04:19.592
The hell?

04:22.679 --> 04:23.680
Honeybees.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.933
Sunflowers, mint, coriander.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.645
Gives the honey an added flavor.
That's why the fertilizer.

04:31.145 --> 04:35.108
-So Friendly Farmer Fred routine, huh?
-Just trying to make a life for ourselves.

04:35.191 --> 04:37.860
Government hasn't exactly been
on our side.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.112
I get that.

04:41.906 --> 04:43.825
The fruits of our labor. Enjoy.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.870
Thank you. Good luck.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.129
What are you up to?
Why did you buy all that fertilizer?

04:56.212 --> 04:58.339
Relax. I've got it covered.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.592
I've been down this road before.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.095
I won't allow anything to happen
on my watch again.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.597
Trust is a two-way street. You understand?

05:06.681 --> 05:09.017
And I trust you know
what you're doing with Ben Stone.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.394
I'll handle him.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.906
Sorry, no luck.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.160
What the hell does that mean?
Where's Eagan?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.121
Doesn't wanna see you. He did send a note.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.052
Okay, talk to me.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.261
Uh, about what?

05:45.345 --> 05:47.388
About anything.
I need a controlled reading.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.767
So tell me about,
I don't know, your last date.

05:52.185 --> 05:53.019
Uh…

05:53.102 --> 05:55.229
Your last vacation. Last meal. Whatever.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.940
Oh, well, most mornings, I have oatmeal.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.695
Organic, rolled, not steel cut,
with almond milk, blueberries,

06:02.779 --> 06:04.030
mm, a sprinkle of chia…

06:04.113 --> 06:06.949
Okay, I think we're good. You can
roll my ass out of here now, Troy.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.076
-Rolling.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.127
I also make a really good French omelet
with Normandy butter. Salt the pan first--

06:18.211 --> 06:20.296
Wait, are you sure
this fMRI machine works?

06:20.380 --> 06:22.048
Where did you get it from?

06:22.131 --> 06:24.675
I gave up my Nets tickets
for the next six months for this.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.593
It works.

06:25.676 --> 06:26.594
Damn it.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.806
I don't understand.
What were you hoping for?

06:30.556 --> 06:32.016
Since we got the black box back,

06:32.100 --> 06:34.185
I've been doing research
on ultra-low frequencies.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.437
Peacocks and a few other animals
use them to communicate,

06:36.521 --> 06:38.314
and I just thought, maybe…

06:38.398 --> 06:39.649
Passengers could too?

06:39.732 --> 06:44.028
Someone or something is communicating
with us through ULF. I know it.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.614
You mean a higher power?

06:46.697 --> 06:49.659
Like the ULF is a sort of God frequency?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.329
Yes, I like that.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.623
But whether I listen
to the black box recording

06:55.706 --> 06:59.460
or listen to you talking about oatmeal,
my brain scan shows up exactly the same.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.630
Okay. This was a fail.

07:57.518 --> 07:58.436
Eden.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.816
Eden, it's Daddy.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.236
There you are.
You can't run off like that.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.908
Um, we're still playing
the invisible game, sweetie,

08:11.991 --> 08:13.534
and this place is dangerous.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.162
-Man.
-Yeah. Yeah, bad man.

08:16.245 --> 08:19.207
Very bad man. But don't worry,
Mommy's here to protect you.

08:19.832 --> 08:20.833
Who loves you most?

08:22.293 --> 08:23.336
Mommy.

08:23.419 --> 08:25.254
That's right, angel.

08:25.838 --> 08:26.839
Mommy.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.513
Eden!

08:34.096 --> 08:36.974
Eden, come back! Eden!

09:29.944 --> 09:31.237
Hey. How'd it go?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.031
Eyes up, Vasquez.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.577
Uh, fertilizer thing checked out.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.955
I dunno. I still have
this nagging feeling though.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.039
It's probably nothing.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.542
What you got there?

09:45.042 --> 09:47.837
Adrian and his crew make honey. Yeah.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.464
You kicked me out of bed
this morning for a jar of honey.

09:50.548 --> 09:54.719
Oh, I'm sorry, Officer.
Can I make it up to you?

09:54.802 --> 09:55.636
Mm.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.846
I don't know. Can you?

10:11.944 --> 10:13.279
Lose the fit.

10:13.904 --> 10:14.947
Bring the honey.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.494
Yes, ma'am.

10:24.081 --> 10:25.082
Follow my lead.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.834
Breathe in and out.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.717
Concentrate on letting go
of all your anger and pain.

10:35.509 --> 10:36.552
Okay.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.734
Man, what the hell is happening?

10:52.568 --> 10:55.613
Keep breathing. In, out.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.365
Dude.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.575
Dude.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.160
-I can do this.
-Dude!

11:01.744 --> 11:05.706
-You need help, man! I'm out.
-Hey! Hey. Hold up.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.001
Is everything okay?

11:09.627 --> 11:11.921
Sorry, I don't know what happened.

11:12.713 --> 11:17.468
Well, you've been batting 1,000.
It's okay to strike out from time to time.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.514
I think I'm just distracted.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.183
Bit of a crisis going on
in my family right now.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.687
Mind if I go home?

11:27.770 --> 11:30.231
Of course.
Look, I'll cover your 3:30.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.461
<i>We have to save her.</i>

11:53.087 --> 11:54.171
<i>It's our job.</i>

11:55.548 --> 11:56.590
Promise me.

11:59.552 --> 12:00.553
I promise.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.101
Eden, sweetie, you know how sometimes
you see things in your head?

12:07.184 --> 12:08.519
Like the windmill?

12:09.729 --> 12:10.896
Yes, Mommy.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.400
Did you see the bad man in your head?

12:14.483 --> 12:15.609
No.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.446
-Did you bring him here?
-No, Mommy.

12:19.405 --> 12:22.616
Well, the bad man is like the wolf
in <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.326
He wants to hurt Mommy.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.747
-Do you want Mommy to get hurt?
-No, Mommy.

12:27.830 --> 12:32.460
Okay, that's why we need to stay upstairs,
and we don't talk to strangers ever.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.171
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Mommy.

12:37.381 --> 12:41.635
Eden, who's the only person
in the whole wide world you can trust?

12:41.719 --> 12:42.803
Mommy.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.556
That's my baby.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.353
I'm sorry. I--

12:51.437 --> 12:54.106
We don't want any trouble.
We just needed somewhere to sleep.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.483
-We can leave.
-It's okay.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.068
I know who you are, Angelina.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.112
We met two years ago,

13:00.196 --> 13:02.740
the day Adrian called you
his blessed angel.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.535
I believe in you. I believe in all angels.

13:11.665 --> 13:12.875
We just wanna be safe.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.253
You will be. Both of you.
I'll make sure of it.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.465
Come.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.401
Is that…

13:39.485 --> 13:41.153
There's one in every room.

13:41.237 --> 13:44.907
If the police come after us,
we grab this and run out back.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.951
Then come the fireworks.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.373
I'm telling you,
Angelina is here with my daughter.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.084
They're both dead and gone.
It was all over the news.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.418
I saw 'em with my own eyes.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.091
You know, Adrian said you were nuts.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.718
All I've ever done is try to help 828ers.

14:05.219 --> 14:08.347
We're all in the same Lifeboat.
I'm not here to hurt anyone. I just…

14:11.100 --> 14:12.726
I just want my daughter back.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.482
If you keep listening to Adrian,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.860
ignoring the Callings,

14:21.944 --> 14:24.405
harboring kidnappers, murderers,

14:25.406 --> 14:27.783
how's that gonna help you
survive your Death Date?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.537
Who are the other passengers here?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.748
Come on. Let me help.

14:37.001 --> 14:42.673
Erika, Violet, Liam, Oscar,
Maddie, and a few supporters.

14:42.756 --> 14:46.093
You can save all of them, Donovan.
You and me. Just untie me.

14:46.969 --> 14:47.928
-Come on.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.805
<i>Donovan, I need help.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

14:51.765 --> 14:52.850
<i>Donovan!</i>

14:52.933 --> 14:53.767
I have to go.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.270
No, no, no, wait, please.
Please. My daughter.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.230
Ask Adrian.
Ask him straight up if they're here.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.609
And tell him, "To deceive God's people
is to perform signs and wonders."

15:03.027 --> 15:05.070
-You tell him that.
-I have to go.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.488
"Signs and wonders."

15:07.114 --> 15:08.616
No! Help me!

15:20.210 --> 15:22.588
You should wait for him at home.
If I hear anything--

15:22.671 --> 15:24.715
If you hear anything,
we wanna be here for it.

15:24.798 --> 15:28.218
We know that our best bet to find out
where Dad went is to stick with you.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.428
So we're staying put.

15:31.138 --> 15:35.017
Stubbornness must be a genetic trait.
Stay out of the way. Touch nothing.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.187
Hi.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.229
Hey.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.068
-Heard you got big, but wow!

15:46.820 --> 15:49.156
Hey. Are you okay?

15:49.239 --> 15:51.951
I make
a soothing matcha ginger tea with honey.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.828
Guys. I'm fine.
It's just, uh, dry weather.

15:55.663 --> 15:56.622
Cal, your scar.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.918
I never got around to sampling it.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.384
Hey. Your dad is gonna be okay.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.053
Yeah, I wish I was as sure as you are.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.681
Well, this is still so amazing to me.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.474
I'd say it's par for the course.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.559
Last night, Cal had a calling.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.730
A bunch of mythological objects
that we've been collecting lit up.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.648
Glowed.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.566
Including the compass,

16:24.650 --> 16:29.780
which had a hidden inscription.
<i>Divinia conscientia</i>.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.657
Divine consciousness.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.283
Everyone knows Latin?

16:34.118 --> 16:40.624
All these signs are pointing
to a heavenly state of all-knowingness.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.086
Whatever it's called,
it's where 828 was all those years.

16:44.169 --> 16:45.546
Where I disappeared to.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.423
Where I knew all the answers.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.467
Maybe you put the wrong passenger
in the machine.

16:52.428 --> 16:56.056
Cal, how do you feel
about enclosed spaces?

17:00.644 --> 17:01.895
What are you doing home?

17:02.396 --> 17:06.358
Head cold. I can beat my Death Date,
but not the flu. Go figure.

17:06.442 --> 17:08.444
Yeah, Cal's been coughing.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.155
Something must be going around.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.907
Tea and honey. Grace always--

17:21.874 --> 17:25.836
-Mick? Hey, what's wrong?
-There's bees every--

17:28.422 --> 17:30.758
Seems like the Callings
are stepping up their game.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.763
I saw one up in Ben's room,
but I didn't think anything of it.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.248
Erika Burness.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.418
Wasn't she one of the nutjobs
who planned the ambush at Vance's house?

18:10.923 --> 18:13.258
-<i>Hey, I need a favor.</i>
Shoot.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.512
<i>What intel do you have</i>
<i>on a passenger named Erika Burness?</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:19.348
Plenty, actually. Why do you ask?

18:20.474 --> 18:23.268
Ben's missing, and no one can find him.
I had a Calling.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.687
There was a bunch of bees.
One landed on a picture of Erika.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.857
Bees, as in honeybees?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.735
Yeah, I guess. Why?

18:32.236 --> 18:34.154
<i>I think I have the answer to your Calling.</i>

18:34.947 --> 18:36.156
I know where Ben is.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.632
What the hell is going on here?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.136
Um, nothing from the looks of it.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.305
This place was popping earlier.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.850
And there was a bunch of 828 passengers,
all led by Adrian.

19:44.933 --> 19:46.977
Making it seem like they were
living off the land,

19:47.477 --> 19:49.646
making honey, super Kumbaya shit.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.648
"Earlier"? Then you went to Drea's?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.400
Yeah, to drop off the honey.

19:54.526 --> 19:55.652
Who wants this?

19:56.236 --> 19:57.404
Defer to the ex-cop.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.115
All right, listen. No one engages
until we fully scope the place out.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.870
Sidebar, marital code.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.539
I think there may be something going on
between Jared and Drea.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.083
Oh, yeah, they're having sex.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.376
-You knew?
-Yeah.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.587
Drea told me. Girl code.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.132
Okay, Ben, if you're in there,
we're coming for you.

20:20.802 --> 20:25.140
What's going on upstairs?
Why won't you let anybody up there?

20:25.224 --> 20:27.434
It's just another passenger
seeking shelter.

20:27.517 --> 20:31.230
Is it Angelina here
with that baby she kidnapped?

20:31.313 --> 20:32.606
What?

20:36.818 --> 20:39.196
You wanna be careful what you say, Adrian.

20:39.279 --> 20:43.617
"To deceive God's people
is to perform signs and wonders."

20:46.912 --> 20:48.247
Where'd you hear that?

20:50.332 --> 20:52.960
-Ben Stone was right.
-I told you not to talk to that man.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.546
You say we're in this together.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.216
Then you lock up Ben

20:59.299 --> 21:01.385
and don't even tell the others he's here?

21:01.468 --> 21:02.386
What's going on?

21:02.469 --> 21:04.930
If you want us to trust you,
you have to tell us the truth.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.140
Is Angelina here?

21:09.851 --> 21:13.272
I had no choice. She had no place to go.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.066
She killed that baby's mother.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.612
I'm not going to jail for that psycho.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.323
I… I'll get rid of her.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.871
It's okay, Eden.
This is my room.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.498
Just stay right here, okay?

21:42.259 --> 21:43.510
What are you doing here?

21:44.678 --> 21:46.346
Mother, you're back.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.974
Thank God. I… I need your help.

21:49.057 --> 21:49.891
Help?

21:51.643 --> 21:52.477
You're beyond help.

21:52.561 --> 21:56.857
You murdered an innocent woman
and kidnapped her baby?

21:56.940 --> 21:58.692
Grace

21:59.651 --> 22:00.944
is dead?

22:02.112 --> 22:04.990
No, I didn't mean to do that. I didn't.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.116
Save it.

22:06.199 --> 22:08.493
I don't even recognize
who you are anymore.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.372
Leave now, or I will call the police.

22:16.001 --> 22:20.047
Mom, please. I'm begging you.
We have nowhere else to go.

22:20.130 --> 22:22.174
You mean, you have no one left to use.

22:22.257 --> 22:24.343
-Mom.

22:24.843 --> 22:26.261
-I don't wanna hear it.
-No!

22:26.345 --> 22:28.972
I cannot hear it anymore.
You have cost this family too much!

22:29.056 --> 22:32.684
-Mother, please!
-I'm done! Get out!

22:33.769 --> 22:34.644
Mommy.

22:35.771 --> 22:36.772
I love you.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.898
You're dead to me.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.209
It's snowing.

22:58.627 --> 22:59.711
You see it too?

23:02.506 --> 23:03.548
Yes, my angel.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.802
Very special snow. Sent to both of us.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.805
Now I know why we were brought here.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.599
"The righteous shall be protected,

23:13.725 --> 23:15.727
and the deceivers will perish."

23:35.872 --> 23:37.374
Cal? You okay?

23:38.708 --> 23:41.711
If "okay" means feeling like
a canned sardine, yeah.

23:42.462 --> 23:43.797
Okay. Here we go.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.140
What the…

24:09.698 --> 24:10.866
Dad!

24:15.579 --> 24:16.663
Get me out of here!

24:16.746 --> 24:18.832
Troy, to your left.
Turn off the black box.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.960
-It's not plugged in.

24:24.087 --> 24:25.172
You're okay.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.340
What the hell's happening?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.176
Look, I'm sorry.
It must have malfunctioned.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.553
No, it was a Calling.

24:31.636 --> 24:34.514
I saw Dad and Eden.
They might be in trouble.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.308
-I know where they are.
-I'm coming with you.

24:36.391 --> 24:39.269
Well, hold on.
Your dad's already trying to find one kid.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.397
I'm not gonna let him lose another.
I'll go. You just tell me where.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.982
It was my Calling. I'm going.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.288
-Can you hold this?
-Yeah.

25:01.082 --> 25:04.628
1, 7, F, 1, 3…

25:06.171 --> 25:08.465
It's just a bunch
of random numbers and letters.

25:10.258 --> 25:12.886
Is that… is that written in blood?

25:20.560 --> 25:22.938
It's Ben. He's here. He's… he's alive.

25:23.438 --> 25:24.689
How do you know?

25:24.773 --> 25:27.275
17F, 13B, those are seat numbers.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.693
Ben was 5C.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.488
He's telling us who's inside.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.419
I say she goes.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.338
And you go.

25:50.257 --> 25:53.343
What? No. Look, I lost my way.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.470
You're losing your way right now.

25:56.346 --> 25:58.640
You said you found the truth
because of Angelina.

25:59.224 --> 26:01.685
I was wrong, but I'll fix this.
Give me a day.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.187
Then what? How can we trust you?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.313
You can't.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.245
He cast me out after promising refuge.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.415
Who's to say
he won't do the same to any of you?

26:23.498 --> 26:25.000
But you're a murderer.

26:25.083 --> 26:29.045
Whether you agree with who I am or not,
we're connected.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.714
All of us.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.013
What have you done?

26:58.199 --> 26:59.618
Holy shit.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.791
Okay. They've got them inside.
We should go in.

27:06.875 --> 27:07.792
Jared said to wait.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.170
Zeke, we have no cell service and no time.
Ben needs us.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.672
I'm not waiting. I'm going in.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.007
Stop!

27:15.675 --> 27:16.760
They have a bomb.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.179
You are all going to be tested.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.723
I'm not taking orders from a little girl.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.434
I'm not a little girl.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.191
-What's that supposed to be?
-It's a detonator.

27:31.274 --> 27:33.151
The fertilizer. You made bombs?

27:33.234 --> 27:34.527
Everyone down on the ground.

27:35.403 --> 27:37.238
-Now!

27:38.907 --> 27:41.201
Today is your day of judgment.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.458
Unbelievable.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.627
Wait, this can't be right.

27:51.878 --> 27:52.754
What?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.964
Well, if I'm reading this scan right,

27:55.048 --> 27:58.385
it's saying Cal's memory center lit up
right when he was having the Calling.

28:00.053 --> 28:04.432
Maybe Cal is remembering something
from when he…

28:05.475 --> 28:08.895
from when you all were in the glow.

28:09.896 --> 28:10.772
Um,

28:11.272 --> 28:14.859
how can you remember something
that hasn't happened yet?

28:17.320 --> 28:18.905
Divine consciousness.

28:19.989 --> 28:21.908
Have we had this wrong the whole time?

28:22.534 --> 28:23.785
Are Callings

28:25.078 --> 28:26.037
memories?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.503
The captain.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.968
Yes, Mommy.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.140
Eden.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.059
No, Mommy.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.520
"He's a big bad wolf."

28:51.396 --> 28:52.814
"Stay upstairs."

28:55.233 --> 28:57.569
"Don't talk to strangers."

29:00.780 --> 29:02.365
"Okay, Mommy."

29:07.871 --> 29:09.289
I'm coming for you, love.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.667
The time for your reckoning has come.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.420
This will be your trial by fire.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.965
My guardian angel
will save those who are worthy

29:19.466 --> 29:21.801
and shepherd us towards salvation.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.220
Eden

29:25.305 --> 29:27.182
is just a child,

29:28.433 --> 29:29.642
not an angel.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.007
It's gonna be okay. We'll go together.

30:01.090 --> 30:03.218
Together we'll find salvation.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.518
Mama.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.896
You want me to be your mommy?

30:14.979 --> 30:16.523
Mama.

30:18.107 --> 30:20.151
You are my guardian angel.

30:20.235 --> 30:23.363
I'll never doubt our connection again,
my sweet girl.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.951
"For I know the plans I have for you,"
declared the Lord.

30:41.089 --> 30:45.510
I know… what it's like
to read the signs wrong.

30:45.593 --> 30:46.469
Believe me.

30:49.222 --> 30:50.431
You can stop this.

30:51.766 --> 30:55.186
-You don't need more blood on your hands.
-Blood on <i>my </i>hands?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.939
You were in
the same airplane Calling, Adrian.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.774
The blood was on <i>your </i>hands!

31:01.276 --> 31:04.028
Everyone I've ever loved has abandoned me.

31:04.946 --> 31:05.905
Pete,

31:06.573 --> 31:08.074
the Stones,

31:09.242 --> 31:10.493
even my own mother.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.623
You made me believe in you.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.377
You swore you would protect me.
Then you left me out in the cold to die!

31:19.460 --> 31:22.630
-But I didn't!
-Yes, you did!

31:29.053 --> 31:30.054
Daddy's coming.

31:35.602 --> 31:39.606
You were right. Adrian lied.
And Angelina, she's insane.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.107
We gotta get out of here.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.070
You're not going anywhere.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.325
Guys, we need to call for backup.
The bomb squad.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.785
-This place can blow at any time.
-Yeah, I'm aware.

31:52.869 --> 31:53.828
Guys, come on.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.830
Okay, call Bowers.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.957
-I'll head up the road, see if I--
-Vasquez.

31:58.791 --> 32:00.585
Cal. Stay back. There's a bomb.

32:00.668 --> 32:02.837
-I know.
-No. Then I'm coming with.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.797
No, just me.

32:04.881 --> 32:08.259
He told me the same thing. Said he had
a Calling. Neglected to mention the bomb.

32:10.637 --> 32:13.598
Cal! Your dad and your sister
are in there. If that place blows…

32:13.681 --> 32:15.683
It's gonna be okay, Aunt Mick.

32:16.225 --> 32:17.727
This is how it has to be.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.398
Mick. Mick, come on.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.250
Don't you see?

32:41.751 --> 32:45.421
Your faith will be like gold
that has been tested in a fire.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.465
And these trials will prove

32:47.548 --> 32:50.885
that your faith is worth much more
than gold that can be destroyed.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.098
Who's there?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.475
She… she has a bomb.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.898
Hey, it's gonna be okay. I promise.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.068
-Who are you?
-It's just me, Angelina.

33:08.069 --> 33:08.987
You were right.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.781
God knows all of our hearts…

33:11.864 --> 33:14.367
…and he puts us in situations
he knows we can handle.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.497
Moses.

33:20.581 --> 33:22.000
You came back to me.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.170
Can we talk?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.007
Privately.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.595
I only trust you.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.182
You get a clean shot, you take it.

33:38.933 --> 33:39.976
Negative.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.151
Come with me.

33:49.485 --> 33:50.319
Nobody move!

33:55.074 --> 33:57.326
-Now they're gone.
-Damn it!

34:04.625 --> 34:06.961
<i>Lost her. Angelina and Cal</i>
<i>moved deeper in the house.</i>

34:07.045 --> 34:09.047
-Are you okay?
-Vance doesn't have eyes on Angelina.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.631
-We gotta hurry.
-Yeah.

34:10.715 --> 34:14.343
Thanks. We gotta get out of here.
The entire place is lined with explosives.

34:19.182 --> 34:21.934
No, no, no! He's okay. We gotta help him.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.186
We gotta help all of them.

34:23.269 --> 34:25.688
Just can't trust Erika.
She's gone off the rails.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.524
Eden. I saw her, Mick.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.777
Cal's on it. He's with Angelina.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.070
Cal? Why would you bring him?

34:32.153 --> 34:34.197
No, I didn't. He came on his own.
It was a Calling.

34:36.157 --> 34:39.285
All right. Eden. She's in a room upstairs.
I heard her through the vent.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.871
We'll take care of him
and cover you from the outside.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.917
Let's go get my girl. And my boy.

34:46.501 --> 34:50.630
I didn't know if you'd recognize me
now that I'm freakishly big.

34:50.713 --> 34:55.218
I didn't. But when you spoke, I just knew.
How did it happen?

34:55.301 --> 34:59.764
Honestly, I don't know.
Sometimes I think it's a punishment.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.141
No, Cal.

35:02.975 --> 35:04.769
You're truly touched by God.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.115
Are you okay?

35:17.198 --> 35:20.701
Yeah, it's just, uh, dry in here.
I think I need some water.

35:20.785 --> 35:21.953
Of course.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.458
All right, you get the passengers out.
I'll go and find Eden.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.626
-Okay.
-Hey.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.545
-Be careful.
-You too.

35:49.021 --> 35:52.608
Hey. The police are here.
You guys are safe. Come on. Let's go. Now!

35:52.692 --> 35:53.651
Let's go.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.907
-Come on.
-Keep moving.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.119
Careful. Watch your step.
All right, here we go.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.079
Adrian, come. You too. Let's go.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.248
Erika's still inside. I'll go look.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.333
Hey, if you double-cross me…

36:09.417 --> 36:12.086
I won't. A quick sweep and I'm out.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.420
Mommy!

36:55.421 --> 36:57.506
-Mommy!
-Eden!

36:58.674 --> 37:01.385
This way.
Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.387
Come on. Come on. Careful. Come on.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.894
-Where's Adrian?
-He's getting more people.

37:09.977 --> 37:13.147
-What about Ben and Cal?
-I don't know. They should be out by now.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.443
Mommy! I want my mommy.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.740
-Give me back my daughter!
-Please, Angelina. It's over.

37:22.823 --> 37:26.327
You lied! You were never here for me.
Give her to me now!

37:26.410 --> 37:27.453
Angelina, please!

37:27.536 --> 37:30.539
Be reasonable, Angelina.
Put the detonator down.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.749
Mommy.

37:33.376 --> 37:34.502
Mommy!

37:34.585 --> 37:36.295
It's okay, angel. Mommy's here.

37:36.379 --> 37:39.173
You saved us once before.
You could save us again.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.217
-Dad, run!
-I'm not leaving you!

37:41.300 --> 37:42.843
-I'll be fine.
-How do you know?

37:42.927 --> 37:44.220
Because I remembered it!

37:49.892 --> 37:51.102
Run!

37:51.769 --> 37:53.229
-Mommy!
-I'll be back.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.026
Eden.

37:59.110 --> 37:59.986
Mick!

38:01.487 --> 38:02.488
Here, take her!

38:04.323 --> 38:05.157
Where's Cal?

38:05.241 --> 38:06.409
I'm going back in!

38:16.669 --> 38:19.005
Cal!

38:26.971 --> 38:28.306
Cal!

38:44.196 --> 38:45.573
-Cal, hurry!
-Cal!

39:04.383 --> 39:05.384
You're safe.

39:06.385 --> 39:07.553
You're both safe.

39:08.304 --> 39:11.140
Daddy's here, baby girl. Daddy's here.

39:12.099 --> 39:13.768
Sorry to bother you. I…

39:14.352 --> 39:16.771
I just wanted to thank you for saving us.

39:17.855 --> 39:19.440
Anyone would have done the same.

39:19.940 --> 39:21.359
You're not just anyone.

39:28.783 --> 39:32.203
Yeah, Olive. I think miracle
is a vast understatement.

39:33.746 --> 39:34.997
We'll be home soon.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.999
Yeah. Love you.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.003
This everyone?

39:42.296 --> 39:45.841
I think so.
Adrian and Angelina are still missing.

39:45.925 --> 39:48.552
Well, this looks more like a recovery
than a rescue.

40:01.982 --> 40:02.942
Zeke!

40:09.448 --> 40:10.408
Zeke!

40:13.828 --> 40:15.663
Everyone clear out now!

40:24.588 --> 40:26.257
That was my gun. I should stay back.

40:26.340 --> 40:30.052
You do and this mess gets
a whole lot worse. Go, now. Everybody out!

40:30.136 --> 40:32.096
Come on. Go.

40:58.038 --> 41:01.959
<i>♪ When your dreams are no longer</i>

41:30.988 --> 41:33.782
Hey, what happened today?

41:35.034 --> 41:38.078
You were enraged.
You were… out of control.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.624
I saw her coming at you,

41:42.583 --> 41:44.502
and my instincts just took over.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.756
You're safe. That's all that matters.

42:19.245 --> 42:21.121
I'm afraid to go to sleep.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.124
This is a dream.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.755
-You did it, Dad. She's home.
-Yeah.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.007
You did it, bud.

42:33.592 --> 42:35.719
Violet was right. You saved all of us.

42:38.389 --> 42:41.183
What did you mean
when you said, "I remembered"?

42:42.768 --> 42:43.894
Like, I just…

42:45.396 --> 42:47.815
I knew the detonator wasn't gonna go off.

42:49.024 --> 42:50.442
Like it happened before.

42:55.030 --> 42:56.115
Right back.

44:06.268 --> 44:07.186
My God.

44:08.312 --> 44:09.229
Leave me.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.148
No.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.816
You were right.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.903
Blood is on my hands.
