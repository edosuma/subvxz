00:00.066 --> 00:02.133
So, you hired him to be
your wedding planner?

00:02.200 --> 00:03.200
Yes, ma'am.

00:03.266 --> 00:05.367
When she cancelled it
because of COVID.

00:05.433 --> 00:07.133
No, she didn't cancel it
because of COVID.

00:08.600 --> 00:11.100
Everything else
was closed after March.

00:13.033 --> 00:14.667
-Do you understand?
-Um...

00:14.734 --> 00:15.734
"Um" is not an answer.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.400
[Narrator]
This is Judy Justice.

00:18.467 --> 00:21.700
[♪ dramatic music]

00:36.100 --> 00:39.500
[Narrator] Kanisha Taylor is suing
wedding planner Carlos Sanchez

00:39.567 --> 00:42.066
for a deposit on wedding services.

00:42.133 --> 00:44.633
[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:44.700 --> 00:46.200
[Judy] Be seated, please.

00:46.266 --> 00:47.467
Hello, Judge.

00:47.533 --> 00:49.600
Case 10-60,
Taylor versus Sanchez.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.100
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.233
Miss Taylor, I assume
that this is your husband.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.500
[Kanisha] It is my husband.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.834
[Judy] And you're recently married.
When were you married?

00:57.900 --> 01:00.900
We were actually married
October of 2019.

01:00.967 --> 01:02.633
That must have been a small party.

01:02.700 --> 01:04.500
Yeah, we actually got married
at the courthouse.

01:04.567 --> 01:06.900
[Judy] But at some point,
you were planning a larger wedding.

01:06.967 --> 01:08.533
-Right.
-[Judy] And in contemplation

01:08.600 --> 01:10.066
of that larger wedding,

01:10.133 --> 01:12.900
you hired Mr. Sanchez
to be your wedding planner?

01:12.967 --> 01:13.900
Décor.

01:13.967 --> 01:15.533
-[Judy] Wedding decor planner?
-Yes.

01:15.600 --> 01:19.166
[Judy] And this case is about
the return of your deposit

01:19.233 --> 01:20.500
that you paid to him

01:20.567 --> 01:23.567
because the wedding was
cancelled because of COVID.

01:23.633 --> 01:24.900
Yes, ma'am.

01:24.967 --> 01:26.800
[Judy]
Okay, that's your general claim.

01:26.867 --> 01:28.900
But it gets a little more
complicated than that.

01:28.967 --> 01:31.467
When was your wedding
originally planned?

01:31.533 --> 01:37.200
It was originally planned
for September 19th of 2020.

01:37.266 --> 01:38.900
[Judy] Where was it
supposed to take place?

01:38.967 --> 01:41.333
In Downey at
the-the Rio Hondo Golf Course.

01:41.400 --> 01:42.900
How many people were you having?

01:42.967 --> 01:44.166
One-fifty.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.867
[Judy] And how much was the venue?

01:46.066 --> 01:47.367
Thirteen and some change.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.133
-Thirteen...?
-[Kanisha] Thousand, sorry.

01:49.200 --> 01:52.200
[Judy] In what month
did you secure the venue?

01:52.266 --> 01:56.667
Maybe December to January
of 2019 or 2020.

01:56.734 --> 01:59.567
Fine. Let's say January of 2020.

01:59.633 --> 02:02.233
And when did you locate
Mr. Sanchez?

02:02.300 --> 02:03.300
[Kanisha] In January.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.967
[Judy] Same time
as you located the venue?

02:05.033 --> 02:06.033
Yes, ma'am.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.533
[Judy]
Did you sign a contract with him?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.700
We did.

02:08.767 --> 02:10.667
-Okay, I'd like to take a look at it.
-Okay.

02:24.934 --> 02:26.533
[Judy] Well, this says,
terms of the contract--

02:26.600 --> 02:30.367
décor, rentals,
chocolate fountain, food.

02:30.433 --> 02:32.800
-No.
-It says client will have food tasting

02:32.867 --> 02:36.100
to pick out and confirm
the food for the event.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.200
Food service will include...

02:38.266 --> 02:40.700
I think that's just
his general standard contract,

02:40.767 --> 02:43.400
but all we had was
the decor and rentals.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.433
The food and everything was
coming from the venue itself.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.600
[Judy] Well,
then I don't know what this is.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.767
Contract must be paid in full
within 30 days before the event.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.533
For every week that passes
without final payment,

02:53.600 --> 02:55.500
there's a $100 fee.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.767
[Judy] I don't know
what you signed here.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.233
There's no price!

02:59.300 --> 03:00.500
[Kanisha] Keep going.

03:00.567 --> 03:02.033
On the other few pages behind it,

03:02.100 --> 03:06.900
you'll see the breakdown of
all the flowers and the rentals.

03:06.967 --> 03:08.000
At the bottom of the page,

03:08.066 --> 03:10.734
you'll see where the deposit was paid,
and the balance.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.400
Actually, it's a ridiculous
contract... [laughs]

03:14.467 --> 03:17.533
...because if you're referring
to an annex document,

03:17.600 --> 03:18.600
this doesn't say anything.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.867
-This calls for a deposit.
-[Carlos] May I?

03:20.934 --> 03:21.934
What?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.600
[Carlos] It's in the first page,
and the one in the last--

03:23.667 --> 03:25.667
in the back is the first page.

03:25.734 --> 03:26.734
And then is the second page.

03:26.800 --> 03:28.934
And the-the other one
is the last page.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.400
Show me the contract, sir.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.667
Show me your copy of the contract.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.967
This has how it has to be, yeah.

03:48.533 --> 03:51.333
Okay.
It's still a ridiculous contract.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.633
I mean, it's just the-the way
it's phrased is ridiculous,

03:54.700 --> 03:57.000
it's not filled out.
Do you understand?

03:57.066 --> 03:58.934
The total deposit, it's blank.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.600
Do you understand what I'm saying?

04:01.000 --> 04:04.066
So, this is your-- D'Angelus Events.
Is that you?

04:04.133 --> 04:05.834
-D'Angelus Events, yes.
-[Judy] All right.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.934
Well, what I'm telling you is,
this has to be filled out.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.166
It's because we do... I'm sorry,
it's because we do a lot of service,

04:13.233 --> 04:16.467
and she only asked for
the flowers and for our décor.

04:16.533 --> 04:17.533
[Judy] Just a second.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.633
There has to be,
in a contract that she signed,

04:20.700 --> 04:23.266
I'm just telling you for future reference,

04:23.333 --> 04:26.700
have the blank spaces filled in,
the total charge,

04:26.767 --> 04:30.367
the amount of deposit,
that should be in this contract.

04:30.433 --> 04:33.633
What's signed is sort of in blank.
Do you understand?

04:33.700 --> 04:35.533
-Yes.
-[Judy] All right. Fine.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.967
So, you hired him in January of 2020.

04:38.033 --> 04:41.233
This event was supposed to be
September of 2020.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.333
That's eight months later.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.133
Between January of 2020
and September of 2020,

04:47.200 --> 04:49.400
did you meet with the defendant?

04:49.467 --> 04:50.800
[Kanisha] We did.
We initially go--

04:50.867 --> 04:51.867
Okay, go ahead.

04:51.934 --> 04:53.567
Tell me the dates
that you met with him.

04:53.633 --> 04:55.900
So, the first meeting was January 10th,

04:55.967 --> 04:58.200
when we signed
the actual contract, uh...

04:58.266 --> 04:59.200
[Judy]
Where did you meet with him?

04:59.266 --> 05:00.633
-[Kanisha] He came to our home.
-[Judy] Okay.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.166
We signed the contract that day.

05:02.233 --> 05:04.333
[Judy] Okay.
But you had contacted him

05:04.400 --> 05:08.533
the beginning of January
when you first took the hall.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.934
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Took the venue.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.567
And then you said,
well, come to the house,

05:11.633 --> 05:14.600
we'll discuss exactly
what you're going to do.

05:14.667 --> 05:15.900
-[Judy] He did.
-Mm-mm.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.600
[Judy] Did he show you
any photographs? Any pictures?

05:18.667 --> 05:21.000
-He did, um...
-Okay, so that took a while.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.266
How long was he there?

05:22.333 --> 05:24.500
He was at the house and ma--
no more than two hours

05:24.567 --> 05:26.066
-for the initial meeting.
-[Judy] Well, just a second.

05:26.133 --> 05:28.800
He was there for two hours,
and you must have been satisfied

05:28.867 --> 05:30.467
because you signed this contract.

05:30.533 --> 05:32.600
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] And that was January 10th.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.367
When was the next time
you saw him?

05:34.433 --> 05:35.900
-[Kanisha] I-I don't know.
-When was the next time

05:35.967 --> 05:37.400
you were there, Mr. Sanchez,

05:37.467 --> 05:39.734
or the next time
you saw the plaintiff?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.300
After I went to her house,
we went to the venue.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.133
It was February 25th.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.767
-[Judy] You went to the venue with her?
-Yes.

05:46.834 --> 05:48.700
Okay. What did you do at the venue?

05:48.767 --> 05:49.767
So, when we went to the venue,

05:49.834 --> 05:52.266
we showed him the outdoor space
and kind of our vision,

05:52.333 --> 05:55.433
and we talked through it,
and just talked about options

05:55.834 --> 05:57.133
and placement of flowers,

05:57.200 --> 06:00.433
and just different options
of draping and whatnot.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.567
And about how long did that take?

06:02.633 --> 06:04.200
Maybe about an hour as well.

06:04.266 --> 06:06.166
-It was more.
-[Judy] Did you see him again?

06:06.233 --> 06:08.600
We saw him, or I saw him,
I went alone

06:08.667 --> 06:11.533
on February 28th,
to do a mock setup.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.667
[Judy] Okay,
and what did you do then?

06:12.734 --> 06:14.233
Can I backtrack before then?

06:14.300 --> 06:16.900
So, we were initially going
to get married in September.

06:16.967 --> 06:19.133
I contacted him literally two weeks

06:19.200 --> 06:23.867
after signing the contract
to push the wedding up to March

06:23.934 --> 06:25.333
because my dad
was diagnosed with cancer,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.433
and we wanted to do it
sooner rather than later.

06:27.500 --> 06:31.433
-You wanted to do it six months earlier?
-Yes, ma'am.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.567
[♪ dramatic music]

06:34.633 --> 06:37.133
You think you're entitled
to $4,000 back?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.400
Well, what about all the time
he spent with you?

06:39.467 --> 06:40.867
I understand that time is...

06:40.934 --> 06:42.500
[Judy] Just a second,
I'm-I'm just asking you.

06:42.567 --> 06:44.567
He spent five to six hours with you.

06:44.633 --> 06:45.567
Mm-mm.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.800
Is he not entitled
to be compensated for that?

06:49.100 --> 06:50.266
[♪ dramatic music]

06:59.500 --> 07:03.367
[Narrator] Kanisha Taylor claims
wedding planner Carlos Sanchez

07:03.867 --> 07:07.367
wrongfully kept her deposit
after a mandatory lockdown.

07:07.433 --> 07:09.767
[Judy] Okay, and venue was free?

07:09.834 --> 07:11.500
-Venue was free.
-[Judy] And he was free?

07:11.567 --> 07:14.567
-He was free.
-So that you had to get moving faster?

07:14.633 --> 07:15.633
Yes, ma'am.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.433
[Judy] Okay, so now
you contacted him--

07:17.500 --> 07:19.467
that I read and that I understood.

07:19.533 --> 07:22.033
So, you contacted him again,
and things started to move

07:22.100 --> 07:23.100
-a little more quickly.
-Right.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.934
Because now we have less time.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.100
-[Kanisha] Right.
-[Judy] And you met him again.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.100
-So, the last time I actually saw him...
-[Judy] February.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.367
...was February 28th...

07:30.433 --> 07:32.567
-[Judy] Okay.
-...when he did the mock setup.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.967
Okay. And did he show you
several different designs?

07:35.033 --> 07:36.033
[Kanisha] We did.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.767
[Judy] How many different
designs did he show you?

07:38.066 --> 07:40.934
[Kanisha] There was two
actual tables that he set up,

07:41.000 --> 07:43.734
that he showed,
and then in his showroom

07:43.800 --> 07:46.233
was the different,
um, options that he had for...

07:46.300 --> 07:48.033
[Judy] Wait, just a second,
did you go to his showroom?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.100
I was at his showroom.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.533
Did you go to the venue?

07:50.600 --> 07:51.533
[Kanisha] Not that day.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
We went to the venue once
where we talked about,

07:53.867 --> 07:55.900
-you know, looking at the theme.
- [Judy] But this time,

07:55.967 --> 07:57.533
-you went out to him.
-Out to him.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.900
And he set up two tables
with two different options,

08:00.967 --> 08:04.133
consistent with
what your initial discussion

08:04.200 --> 08:05.967
-was at the venue?
-Right.

08:06.033 --> 08:07.967
Okay.
And you selected one?

08:08.033 --> 08:08.967
[Kanisha] Right.

08:09.033 --> 08:11.266
And that's when I gave him
the second deposit

08:11.333 --> 08:13.033
of $3,000 on that day.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.867
[Judy] Okay, so the first
deposit was $1,000.

08:14.934 --> 08:15.934
Yes.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.900
-[Judy] Second deposit was $3,000?
-Yes.

08:18.967 --> 08:22.367
In total, you gave him $4,000,
which is what you're suing for?

08:22.433 --> 08:23.533
Yes, ma'am.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.633
Okay, and you think you're entitled
to $4,000 back?

08:26.700 --> 08:29.000
I think I'm entitled to 4,000

08:29.066 --> 08:32.367
less the setup fee that he incurred,

08:32.433 --> 08:34.000
the actual fees that he incurred.

08:34.066 --> 08:35.500
That's what I was asking for.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.934
Well, what about all the time
he spent with you?

08:38.000 --> 08:39.667
I understand that time...

08:39.734 --> 08:41.233
[Judy] Just a second,
I'm-I'm just asking you.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.233
He spent with you probably
at least five to six hours.

08:46.300 --> 08:47.300
-[Kanisha] Okay.
-[Judy] In total,

08:47.367 --> 08:48.934
not including the setup fee

08:49.000 --> 08:51.767
that he did independently
when you weren't there.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.967
He spent five to six hours with you.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.333
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] And your husband.

08:55.400 --> 08:57.967
Is he not entitled to be
compensated for that?

08:58.033 --> 09:00.166
-I will say yes.
-[Judy] Oh, yes.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.967
But my question would be, like,
again, it's not in the contract.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.900
I feel like he just kind of
pulled a number out of the sky,

09:05.967 --> 09:08.166
just like he pulled
a 500-dollar contract fee

09:08.567 --> 09:11.367
out of the sky.
Like that was nowhere discussed,

09:11.433 --> 09:13.133
that was just kind of something he...

09:13.200 --> 09:16.467
It's not discussed
because nobody anticipated...

09:16.533 --> 09:18.233
-[Kanisha] Right.
-that if you were supposed

09:18.300 --> 09:21.100
to be married in mid-March.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.333
Or late March, but yeah.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.500
Late March, and on March 15th,

09:24.567 --> 09:27.100
the state was shut down,
and you couldn't have a wedding.

09:27.166 --> 09:30.400
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] The venue itself

09:30.467 --> 09:34.300
hadn't done anything for you,
other than hold the date.

09:34.367 --> 09:36.800
And the tasting, we did a tasting
with the venue as well.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.633
-But yeah.
-You did a tasting?

09:38.700 --> 09:40.867
-[Kanisha] With the venue.
-Did they charge you for that?

09:40.934 --> 09:41.867
They did not.

09:41.934 --> 09:43.166
[Judy] Did they give you back
your full deposit?

09:43.233 --> 09:44.367
Yes, ma'am.

09:44.433 --> 09:45.433
[Judy] That was very nice of them.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.433
Did you have
a wedding there ultimately?

09:47.500 --> 09:48.700
We did not.

09:48.767 --> 09:50.266
[Judy] Okay.
It was very nice of them.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.667
They did a tasting. It's a big operation,

09:52.734 --> 09:54.467
but there's certain amount of work

09:54.533 --> 09:56.533
that he performed, you know.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.200
How do I explain this to you?

09:58.266 --> 10:00.633
If you go to see a dentist,

10:00.700 --> 10:05.166
and the dentist is performing
a whole procedure to put in a crown.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.133
In order to do that,
there are procedures.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.767
They have to first sometimes do--

10:09.834 --> 10:12.400
a root canal, then they may
have to shave down a tooth.

10:12.467 --> 10:16.867
And, let's say, the patient dies before...

10:16.934 --> 10:19.900
[laughs] ...they can get the crown put in.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.867
Does that mean that
the dentist doesn't get paid

10:21.934 --> 10:23.200
for all the work that they did?

10:23.266 --> 10:24.633
No, absolutely not. They'll bill.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.734
-[Judy] Okay.
-I get it.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.033
-So, he did work.
-Mm-mm.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.100
[Judy] And what you want to do is,

10:30.166 --> 10:33.433
you want to put a value
on his hourly time.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.133
-[Judy] You're employed?
-I am.

10:35.200 --> 10:38.767
[Judy] Are you paid by week,
every two weeks, by the hour?

10:38.834 --> 10:41.367
I'm a salaried employee,
but I get paid every two weeks.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.700
[Judy] Okay, and how much do you
make approximately per hour?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.533
About 70 bucks an hour.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.633
[Judy] And what kind of work
does your husband do?

10:48.700 --> 10:50.467
[Kanisha]
He works for the oil refinery.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.066
And is he a salaried
employee by weekly,

10:53.133 --> 10:54.567
or is he by the hour?

10:54.633 --> 10:55.567
He's hourly.

10:55.633 --> 10:57.000
[Judy]
And what's his hourly wage?

10:57.066 --> 10:59.734
He makes about
45, 50 bucks an hour.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.000
What much do you make an hour,
so you know exactly.

11:02.066 --> 11:03.133
Forty-two.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.700
[Judy] So, here you have
two people.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.967
You make $70 an hour;
he makes 42.

11:08.033 --> 11:11.900
[Judy] There are lawyers who charge
$600 an hour for their work.

11:11.967 --> 11:12.967
[Kanisha] Mm-mm.

11:13.033 --> 11:17.100
And there are lawyers who charge
$1,500 for their work.

11:17.166 --> 11:18.700
-[Judy] They're both lawyers.
-Mm-mm.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.867
You're allowed to set a rate.

11:20.934 --> 11:24.667
Once this contract
is no longer in existence,

11:24.734 --> 11:27.266
and there's an impossibility
in this case,

11:27.333 --> 11:29.900
it's not your fault or his fault.

11:29.967 --> 11:33.834
It became an issue of
impossibility of performance.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.333
-Mm-mm.
-[Judy] And then, it's up to us

11:36.400 --> 11:39.066
to try to find a reasonable--

11:39.133 --> 11:41.467
since it's impossible
for either one of you

11:41.533 --> 11:44.200
to perform ultimately the contract,

11:44.266 --> 11:46.800
he's entitled to be paid for the work

11:46.867 --> 11:49.333
that he actually did for you.

11:49.400 --> 11:51.767
That seems only reasonable and fair,

11:51.834 --> 11:55.633
and that would come under
a theory of Quantum Meruit.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.533
-How much is it worth?
-[Kanisha] Mm-mm.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.834
[Judy] So, how much did he
offer you as a refund?

12:00.900 --> 12:02.734
Two thousand,
nine hundred forty dollars.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.000
[Judy]
Is what he gave you back?

12:04.066 --> 12:05.166
No, he gave me nothing back.

12:05.233 --> 12:07.900
This is what he offered me
in the form of a "coupon."

12:07.967 --> 12:08.900
[Judy] Just a second.

12:08.967 --> 12:12.734
He offered you $2,940 back,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.066
which means that he was charging you

12:15.133 --> 12:17.200
a thousand dollars, in effect,

12:17.266 --> 12:20.133
for all the hours that he spent
and the work that he did.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.033
Not necessarily,
it was a breakdown.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.934
So, the-the deduction
was 500-dollar contract fee

12:25.000 --> 12:27.266
that he implemented.

12:27.333 --> 12:31.166
It was four hours of his time,
times $70 per hour.

12:31.233 --> 12:34.934
And then for the actual setup,
it was $280

12:35.000 --> 12:36.667
that he was actually out of pocket

12:36.734 --> 12:38.700
for the setup that he did on the 28th.

12:38.767 --> 12:40.700
And so the 2,940, again,

12:40.767 --> 12:43.400
wasn't even in the form of a refund.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.633
He said these were "coupons"
that could be used

12:46.700 --> 12:49.900
back in his business
at three different times.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.400
If he offered you 2,940,

12:52.467 --> 12:54.533
that would seem to be
a reasonable figure,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.433
if he offered you 2,940 back in cash,

12:57.500 --> 12:59.033
-because you paid him in check.
-Right.

12:59.100 --> 12:59.867
[Judy]
Do you understand that, sir?

12:59.934 --> 13:01.500
That would seem
to be reasonable.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.300
-I understand.
-[Judy] Okay.

13:03.367 --> 13:05.433
[♪ dramatic music]

13:05.500 --> 13:08.033
Where are the contracts
with the table companies,

13:08.100 --> 13:09.133
the chair companies?

13:09.200 --> 13:10.200
They are my tables.

13:10.266 --> 13:11.500
Oh, then you're not entitled to that.

13:11.567 --> 13:12.567
Um...

13:12.633 --> 13:14.533
-"Um" is not an answer.
-[Carlos] No, no [laughs].

13:14.600 --> 13:16.066
I want to know what else you did.

13:16.133 --> 13:17.967
If you did something else, tell me.

13:18.033 --> 13:19.433
[♪ dramatic music]

13:25.433 --> 13:28.367
[♪ dramatic music]

13:29.600 --> 13:33.600
[Narrator] Kanisha Taylor is accusing
wedding planner Carlos Sanchez

13:33.667 --> 13:35.467
of keeping her deposit.

13:35.533 --> 13:39.867
Carlos says Kanisha refused his offer
to reschedule the wedding.

13:39.934 --> 13:42.367
If he offered you 2,940,

13:42.433 --> 13:44.600
that would seem to be
a reasonable figure

13:44.667 --> 13:48.300
if he offered you 2,940 back in cash
because you paid him in check.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.033
-Right.
-Do you understand that, sir?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.467
I understand.

13:51.533 --> 13:54.567
I offer her a credit, a credit for...

13:54.633 --> 13:55.967
[Judy] No, no,
we're not a credit.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.367
You were out your time,

13:57.433 --> 14:01.333
and whatever actual money
that you spent

14:01.400 --> 14:03.567
setting up the tables
and showing her

14:03.633 --> 14:06.900
what the venue might look like.
You're entitled to that.

14:06.967 --> 14:10.533
But no one knows how long
COVID is going to impede

14:10.600 --> 14:13.333
the ability of someone
to have indoor gatherings.

14:13.400 --> 14:18.100
So, you are unable, by law,
to perform this contract.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.200
-[Judy] Do you understand?
-Yes.

14:19.266 --> 14:21.834
You're unable, by law,
to perform this contract.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.000
She is unable to do her part

14:24.066 --> 14:26.166
and pay you
to perform this contract.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.767
So, in my judgment,

14:27.834 --> 14:31.834
you are entitled to
a certain amount of compensation

14:31.900 --> 14:33.166
for the work that you did.

14:33.233 --> 14:36.667
The venue, with the exception
of giving them a tasting dinner,

14:36.734 --> 14:38.633
did nothing.
It didn't buy food,

14:38.700 --> 14:41.266
it didn't spend any time
with them

14:41.333 --> 14:43.367
other than the initial
showing the venue

14:43.433 --> 14:45.033
and the venue,
you signed the papers

14:45.100 --> 14:47.800
and then you went for tasting,
and it opened itself up

14:48.066 --> 14:51.033
so that he could come in and look
at the venue, which is nothing.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.900
They were out no money,
they bought nothing,

14:53.967 --> 14:55.967
they really didn't spend
a lot of time with you

14:56.100 --> 14:57.834
other than they would
with any customer,

14:58.200 --> 15:00.367
just as the first time
you spoke to him.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.800
The second time
he came to your house

15:01.867 --> 15:04.233
when you discussed things
that he spent two hours there,

15:04.300 --> 15:06.300
he's entitled
to be compensated for that.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.266
And you're compensated
at the rate of

15:08.333 --> 15:10.667
-Seventy dollars an hour, right?
-Yes, ma'am.

15:10.734 --> 15:13.000
[Judy] So, let's say,
he's entitled to be compensated

15:13.367 --> 15:15.100
the same as you are.
Reasonable?

15:15.166 --> 15:18.033
Six times seven is $420.

15:18.266 --> 15:19.433
So, he says,
but he said four hours.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.200
In the initial one,
he said he only spent

15:21.266 --> 15:24.033
four hours with me,
and that was in his reply to me.

15:24.100 --> 15:25.100
I'd like to see it.

15:30.266 --> 15:32.667
Even you said he spent
five hours with you.

15:32.734 --> 15:33.734
Yeah, it was a rough guess.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.834
[Judy] Well,
what I'm telling you,

15:34.900 --> 15:36.734
-you said you spent five.
-Right.

15:38.433 --> 15:39.266
Okay.

15:40.533 --> 15:42.367
So, you made flower samples?

15:42.433 --> 15:44.000
-[Carlos] Yes.
-[Judy] Representatives' time,

15:44.066 --> 15:45.467
$70 an hour.

15:45.533 --> 15:48.467
Look at that.
Times four is 280.

15:48.533 --> 15:50.433
And the flowers were 190.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.367
And you want to tell me what
"company contract" means of $500?

15:54.433 --> 15:55.867
All that paperwork.

15:55.934 --> 15:59.834
Obviously reserve the tables,
the letters and also the flowers.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.967
[Judy] First show me.

16:01.033 --> 16:03.333
Just show me. You already
have the flowers down here.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.533
-Yes.
-[Judy] As 190.

16:04.700 --> 16:05.867
You're getting credit for that.

16:05.934 --> 16:07.767
-So far, we're to 470.
-[Carlos] And...

16:07.834 --> 16:10.200
I'd like to see what you did to reserve--

16:10.266 --> 16:13.033
Where are the contracts
with the table companies,

16:13.100 --> 16:14.200
the chair companies?

16:14.266 --> 16:15.333
They are my tables.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.633
[Judy] Oh, then you're
not entitled to that.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.333
No, no, bah, okay.
Can I-- can I say something?

16:19.400 --> 16:20.567
Yeah.

16:20.934 --> 16:24.934
Okay, when she cancelled
it because for COVID, it wasn't...

16:25.000 --> 16:26.834
[Judy] No, she didn't cancel it
because of COVID.

16:26.900 --> 16:31.000
The contract that you rendered
was unenforceable by law.

16:31.066 --> 16:32.567
It was unenforceable.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.967
Based upon her figure,

16:34.033 --> 16:36.900
it was a little bit more than
four hours

16:36.967 --> 16:38.333
that you spent with her,

16:38.400 --> 16:40.900
but you're not entitled to
making a contract with yourself.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.533
I mean, if you engaged
in contract negotiations

16:43.600 --> 16:46.133
with other vendors for
chairs or anything else,

16:46.200 --> 16:48.300
I would consider that,
but so far, you didn't.

16:48.367 --> 16:50.400
So, the contract
was unenforceable.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.133
And based upon your own statement to her,

16:53.200 --> 16:55.233
the time that you spent
was four hours.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.900
You're entitled to that, at $70 an hour,
which is exactly what you earn,

16:58.967 --> 17:03.166
and the flowers that,
put together, were $190.

17:03.233 --> 17:07.433
So, that together is $470.

17:07.500 --> 17:12.500
And, therefore,
you should return to her $3,630.

17:12.567 --> 17:13.734
Um...

17:13.800 --> 17:15.633
-[Judy] "Um" is not an answer.
-No, no. [laughs]

17:15.700 --> 17:16.800
I want to know what else you did.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.400
If you did something else, tell me.

17:18.467 --> 17:21.967
We make sure
that tables and the layers

17:22.033 --> 17:25.266
that she wants for her table
and also...

17:25.333 --> 17:27.266
Those are your things,
you said to me.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.333
That's your property.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.934
But we then sell it to another person
because we already have...

17:32.000 --> 17:33.066
[Judy] You couldn't sell,
you couldn't sell it,

17:33.133 --> 17:36.800
you couldn't-- you couldn't
sell it or rent it to another person

17:36.867 --> 17:40.367
because everything else
was closed after March.

17:40.633 --> 17:41.900
Everything else was closed.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.667
You couldn't rent them
to anybody else.

17:43.734 --> 17:44.967
-[Carlos] Of course not.
-[Judy] Of course not.

17:45.033 --> 17:47.734
Okay.
The cancellation of these events

17:47.800 --> 17:50.333
wrought havoc
on the venue business

17:50.400 --> 17:53.300
for well over a year,
probably still is.

17:53.367 --> 17:55.900
As I said, you're entitled
to be compensated.

17:55.967 --> 17:59.967
And I certainly would not
give her back her $4,000

18:00.100 --> 18:03.533
because that would sort of be
like her missing a week's pay

18:03.600 --> 18:05.934
if they close the plant
where she was working,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.700
and she would say, well, I was here,
I'm ready to do my job.

18:08.767 --> 18:10.266
And the plant would say,
listen, this is COVID.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.300
But I actually
came to work every day.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.600
I drove there every day,
I did work from home,

18:14.667 --> 18:16.433
I expended time.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.934
She would want to be paid,
you're entitled to be paid.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.800
But by your own analysis, what
you're entitled to be paid was $370.

18:24.867 --> 18:28.734
And so, she gets her deposit back,
less that $370.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.400
-Thank you. We're finished.
-Thank you.

18:30.633 --> 18:31.934
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.934
[♪ dramatic music]

18:34.333 --> 18:36.767
I'm happy. I-I-I agree with her.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.000
I think it was very fair.

18:38.066 --> 18:39.400
I don't think it's fair.

18:39.467 --> 18:43.834
Uh, everything with the COVID,
like our company,

18:43.900 --> 18:45.233
it was very difficult and--

18:45.300 --> 18:48.066
I tried.
I sent texts, I sent emails,

18:48.133 --> 18:50.166
um, I had a lawyer
send a demand letter

18:50.233 --> 18:51.834
to try and resolve it
before we got here,

18:51.900 --> 18:53.266
um, to no resolve.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.667
But I'm happy.

18:54.734 --> 18:58.767
To give back money right now
is very difficult for our company,

18:58.834 --> 19:00.066
and obviously myself.

19:00.133 --> 19:02.100
Time to live happily ever after now.

19:02.166 --> 19:05.100
I'm going to change
that contract to be more clear.

19:05.166 --> 19:08.233
So, although it wasn't my
best class in all of law school,

19:08.300 --> 19:10.000
one thing I do remember
from contracts

19:10.066 --> 19:12.633
is the importance
of a force majeure clause,

19:12.700 --> 19:15.700
where it allocates, uh,
the risk of loss

19:15.767 --> 19:19.834
if something unexpected happens
at no fault of either party.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.834
And in this case,
they really could have benefited

19:21.900 --> 19:25.467
from a clause such as that
because they could have stated

19:25.533 --> 19:28.033
who was going to pay,
what the refund was going to be,

19:28.100 --> 19:29.967
how much she was
compensated for time

19:30.033 --> 19:31.934
if the wedding
did not end up happening.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.500
So, I think that it's important
that you really

19:33.567 --> 19:35.867
review your contracts
before signing them.

19:35.934 --> 19:38.133
Yeah. [laughs]
I-I agree with you.

19:38.200 --> 19:41.967
I didn't actually think of force majeure,
but that's exactly what it is.

19:42.033 --> 19:44.233
It's a major force
that pre-- precludes

19:44.300 --> 19:47.600
either party from performing
the terms of the contract,

19:47.667 --> 19:51.133
and defining what their
responsibility is, if any,

19:51.200 --> 19:54.533
if something prevents
the contract from going forward.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Interesting.
