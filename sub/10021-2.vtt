00:07.110 --> 00:09.874
<i>- Previously on</i> ER:
- Welcome to County General.

00:10.080 --> 00:12.173
- You do know how to do this, right?
- Yes.

00:12.382 --> 00:15.442
You've broken every rule
and regulation we have in the ER.

00:15.652 --> 00:18.678
It's in the child's best interest
to complete what's begun.

00:18.889 --> 00:22.381
I'm asking you, Dr. Anspaugh,
about the possibility of sponsorship.

00:22.592 --> 00:26.460
- You don't want to stay with Romano?
- Romano doesn't wish to stay with me.

00:26.663 --> 00:28.631
I'm not sleeping since
I've been an R.A.

00:28.832 --> 00:32.097
I took a day off to run the clinic.
Can you spare any help?

00:32.302 --> 00:34.634
District Medical Director
for EMS is open.

00:34.838 --> 00:36.931
We could use someone like you
on our side.

00:42.479 --> 00:44.947
- Dr. Carter?
- Dr. Carter, are you there?

00:45.148 --> 00:46.638
I'm so sorry, but we...

00:46.850 --> 00:48.215
We're locked out!

00:48.418 --> 00:50.079
All right. Hang on.

00:50.487 --> 00:52.318
Hang on, I'm coming.

00:56.393 --> 00:57.690
Yes?

01:03.233 --> 01:04.063
What's up?

01:04.266 --> 01:06.394
Dr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I know it's late...

01:06.603 --> 01:08.571
- Really early, but we...
- We're locked out.

01:08.772 --> 01:11.297
We were in the library.
I thought he had his key...

01:11.508 --> 01:14.443
...he thought I had mine...
- I did have a key, okay?

01:14.644 --> 01:16.236
But it wasn't my old dorm key.

01:16.446 --> 01:18.846
I had my apartment key,
but my sister threw me out.

01:19.049 --> 01:21.017
Okay. I got a master key.

01:21.685 --> 01:22.879
Sorry to wake you.

01:23.086 --> 01:24.610
It's my job.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:33.129 --> 01:34.096
Oh, Peter.

01:36.666 --> 01:38.463
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

01:38.668 --> 01:41.569
No, no. I didn't expect you
to finish so soon.

01:41.771 --> 01:45.104
Well, I...
It was just a spleen.

01:45.308 --> 01:46.741
I was thinking about you.

01:46.943 --> 01:50.276
So I thought I would come over...

01:52.616 --> 01:56.416
Come over and finish what we started.

01:57.554 --> 01:59.818
Peter, Peter, I...

02:00.390 --> 02:01.652
What?

02:02.726 --> 02:05.194
Before you jump to any
conclusions...

02:06.296 --> 02:07.388
You're not alone.

02:07.597 --> 02:10.088
- Right. I was trying...
- Sorry to wake you so early.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.062
This jet lag always...

02:13.770 --> 02:17.536
Oh, excuse me. I didn't realize
anyone had arrived.

02:17.741 --> 02:19.265
Allow me.

02:19.476 --> 02:22.912
This is Peter Benton,
a work colleague.

02:23.847 --> 02:25.280
Obviously a friend.

02:25.482 --> 02:29.680
Peter, this is Charles Corday,
my father.

02:33.924 --> 02:35.084
Oh.

02:36.326 --> 02:37.850
Nice to meet you.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.531
The toilet's overflowing.

02:46.169 --> 02:48.399
- What?
- In the women's bathroom.

02:48.605 --> 02:50.300
It's going all over the floor.

02:50.774 --> 02:53.766
Sounds like a call for Maintenance.
I'm just the R.A.

02:53.977 --> 02:55.308
Well, they're not on until 7.

02:55.512 --> 02:57.605
You better come. It's getting bad.

02:58.715 --> 03:01.343
I'm calling to confirm
an 8 a.m. Appointment.

03:01.551 --> 03:02.711
Carol Hathaway.

03:02.919 --> 03:05.114
- A/C working?
- I'm on with them now.

03:05.322 --> 03:06.152
Thank you.

03:06.356 --> 03:08.847
Hey. Don't worry,
you'll knock them dead.

03:09.059 --> 03:10.720
- Uh-oh. What did she do wrong?
- Me?

03:10.927 --> 03:13.987
See a med student in two hours early,
she must have screwed something up.

03:14.197 --> 03:16.131
She's checking her labs
from yesterday.

03:16.333 --> 03:17.163
Just for fun.

03:17.367 --> 03:19.767
I just want to make sure nothing
slips through the cracks.

03:19.970 --> 03:20.959
Don't burn out.

03:21.171 --> 03:23.139
- She's the Resident's pet.
- I am not!

03:23.340 --> 03:25.934
- She got an IV her first day.
- So I was lucky.

03:26.142 --> 03:27.541
- Good morning, all.
- Good morning.

03:28.078 --> 03:30.444
Can somebody take a look
at my grandson?

03:30.647 --> 03:32.171
Sure. Someone will be with you.

03:32.415 --> 03:34.474
- I'll look at him. Lucy, join me?
- Sure.

03:34.684 --> 03:37.983
A month ago he started walking.
Now he just lays there.

03:38.188 --> 03:40.884
- I'll join you as soon as I can.
- There's no need.

03:41.091 --> 03:42.285
Take them to Exam 4.

03:42.492 --> 03:45.188
If you need me to sign off
on any procedures...

03:45.395 --> 03:48.193
Check your calendar, Kerry.
My probation was for 30 days.

03:48.398 --> 03:51.060
- I'm a free man again.
- Thirty working days, Doug.

03:51.267 --> 03:52.598
- I don't think so.
- Check on that.

03:52.802 --> 03:54.394
I'm sure you will. I got him.

03:54.604 --> 03:55.901
Good luck upstairs. Come on.

04:11.254 --> 04:12.812
John Carter.

04:13.823 --> 04:17.623
Dad, hi. How's the sailing?

04:22.932 --> 04:26.026
I think Gamma's being dramatic.

04:26.770 --> 04:30.228
Because it's not a slum,
it's a dorm.

04:32.108 --> 04:34.235
Well, Dad, it pays the rent.

04:34.944 --> 04:36.536
I said, it pays the rent.

04:38.815 --> 04:40.806
No, I'm not turning my back.

04:41.951 --> 04:43.782
Because I'm still a doctor.

04:44.687 --> 04:48.714
It's just not clear whether they'll
be able to pay me this year.

04:50.593 --> 04:52.959
The R.A. Position is for Residents.

04:54.497 --> 04:57.091
No, there's...

04:57.300 --> 04:59.393
...student advising and counseling.

04:59.602 --> 05:03.094
It's, you know, practically
a faculty position.

05:03.673 --> 05:05.732
And it feels good to pay my own way.

05:06.242 --> 05:07.300
Dad?

05:09.045 --> 05:10.103
Dad?

05:11.614 --> 05:14.174
Hello? Hello?

06:08.004 --> 06:10.472
Yosh, I'm so sorry.
I'm so excited. They said yes!

06:10.673 --> 06:11.867
- They said yes?
- Yes!

06:12.075 --> 06:14.134
- You're hot stuff!
- Thanks.

06:15.678 --> 06:17.236
Mark, thank you so much.

06:17.447 --> 06:18.846
- They said yes.
- To your proposal?

06:19.249 --> 06:20.944
Thanks to Mark's letter of support.

06:21.151 --> 06:25.212
I just told the truth. I said
your clinic deserved a salaried RN.

06:25.421 --> 06:26.479
There you go, baby.

06:26.689 --> 06:29.283
- Why's it flashing?
- Calling on the landline.

06:29.492 --> 06:32.359
- He's learning the radio.
- Are you taking the EMS job?

06:32.562 --> 06:33.688
I haven't decided yet.

06:33.897 --> 06:35.296
Just touch the screen.

06:35.498 --> 06:37.363
- On the number?
- It won't bite.

06:39.335 --> 06:40.165
What did I do?

06:40.370 --> 06:42.361
When you touch it twice, you hang up.

06:42.572 --> 06:43.903
They'll call back.

06:44.107 --> 06:46.234
Jerry, what's going on with the A/C?

06:46.442 --> 06:49.070
It takes a couple minutes
for it to cool down.

06:50.213 --> 06:51.510
They're on Med 9.

06:51.714 --> 06:53.477
I've gotta take this to the lab.

06:53.683 --> 06:54.945
I'll take over.

06:55.151 --> 06:57.813
Okay, go ahead. Just once.

06:58.188 --> 06:59.280
Check volume.

06:59.689 --> 07:04.023
<i>Pulse 120. Gave 500 cc's</i>
<i>of normal saline. Copy?</i>

07:04.227 --> 07:07.663
County General on Med 9.
We didn't catch the first part.

07:07.864 --> 07:09.161
Can you repeat?

07:09.365 --> 07:12.095
You have to step on the pedal
when you speak.

07:13.670 --> 07:17.572
- County General on Med 9...
- You gotta switch over to Med 9 first.

07:18.474 --> 07:20.635
- Now.
- County General on Med 9.

07:20.843 --> 07:22.504
Can you repeat the information?

07:22.712 --> 07:24.475
I said pulling up now.

07:24.681 --> 07:28.412
Single-vehicle MVA.
62-year-old restrained driver.

07:28.618 --> 07:29.778
What's with the radio?

07:29.986 --> 07:33.513
Mark's considering a future in EMS.
We were teaching him the ropes.

07:33.723 --> 07:37.989
BP's 100/60. Tachy at 120,
diaphoretic. Air bags deployed.

07:38.194 --> 07:39.855
Wife was a passenger.

07:40.063 --> 07:41.928
He groaned and slumped
over the wheel.

07:42.131 --> 07:43.826
Thank goodness we were barely moving!

07:44.033 --> 07:45.022
I didn't know you were on today.

07:45.235 --> 07:48.033
I'm not. I'm just talking to
paramedics. When you're done.

07:48.238 --> 07:50.798
We'll take very good care
of your husband.

07:54.444 --> 07:58.073
So if I can't persuade my daughter,
you'd be interested in the job?

07:58.715 --> 08:01.445
I have considered
a cardiothoracic fellowship.

08:01.651 --> 08:03.243
As a specialty it has it all.

08:03.486 --> 08:07.252
The heart. The most magnificent
machine in creation.

08:07.457 --> 08:09.789
I'm flattered you came
all this way...

08:09.993 --> 08:12.052
...to convince me to join
your practice.

08:12.262 --> 08:15.925
It was on my way. I can't appear
too eager with this one.

08:16.132 --> 08:19.693
And I can't be so picky. It isn't
as if I have other options.

08:20.603 --> 08:22.833
Darling, isn't that him? Romano?

08:23.306 --> 08:24.796
Oh, God! Don't let him spot us.

08:25.008 --> 08:28.603
He keeps leaving messages about
some dreadful lap choly today.

08:28.811 --> 08:30.574
Well, he still is your sponsor.

08:30.780 --> 08:35.183
He only wants me because he's got
a potential partner to see the Aesop.

08:35.385 --> 08:36.784
And he's not certified.

08:36.986 --> 08:38.419
The Aesop robot? Brilliant.

08:38.621 --> 08:41.681
It galls me to help him in any way.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.553
I wouldn't give him
the satisfaction of seeing that.

08:44.761 --> 08:46.786
I expect my daughter to fight.

08:46.996 --> 08:47.985
Dive in there.

08:48.197 --> 08:52.759
Impress the hell out of him. Make the
bugger rue the day he terminated you.

08:54.003 --> 08:55.368
Yeah, go for it.

08:55.571 --> 08:57.198
I feel ganged up on.

08:57.407 --> 08:59.136
Lizzie. Peter.

08:59.342 --> 09:02.641
Mr. Corday, what a surprise.
I bet you're on your way to UCSF.

09:02.845 --> 09:06.508
I came to visit my daughter
while she was still here.

09:06.983 --> 09:09.975
I'm sorry we were unable to
continue the fellowship.

09:10.186 --> 09:13.678
I was never fond of her working
with you in the first place.

09:13.890 --> 09:14.822
I recall that.

09:16.926 --> 09:18.860
You got my message about the Aesop?

09:19.062 --> 09:20.427
Wouldn't miss it.

09:20.630 --> 09:24.623
Although, technically, you'll
be assisting me, right?

09:27.737 --> 09:29.500
Well, you got me on that one.

09:30.106 --> 09:32.973
You know, I haven't
seen this gadget in action.

09:33.176 --> 09:35.201
If that's all right with Dr. Romano?

09:35.411 --> 09:37.572
I'd be honored.

09:41.818 --> 09:46.448
I should've brought him in before,
but he seemed better at his cousin's.

09:46.656 --> 09:47.987
Temp's still 100.5.

09:48.191 --> 09:50.625
- Where's his cousin live?
- Waukegan. On the lake.

09:50.827 --> 09:53.057
Sounds nice and cool.
Miss Knight, what tests?

09:53.262 --> 09:54.627
A full metabolic workup.

09:54.831 --> 09:55.820
That sounds bad.

09:56.366 --> 09:57.958
We'll try something else first.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.931
- Yosh, can you find a fan?
- There's one in the lounge.

10:01.137 --> 10:03.230
We'll cool the room, see if
it helps your grandson.

10:03.439 --> 10:05.737
I turn the lights out,
that seems to help.

10:05.942 --> 10:09.844
We'll try that too. Be right back.
Want to keep an eye on him?

10:15.184 --> 10:17.209
- Questions?
- An infant losing milestones.

10:17.420 --> 10:19.183
Sounds like a metabolic disorder.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.823
Ordinarily, you'd be right to
check that first.

10:22.024 --> 10:24.219
But he's got a fever
and he's not even damp.

10:24.427 --> 10:26.952
Why are the lights out in Exam 4?

10:27.163 --> 10:31.156
We're cooling a young boy down with
anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia.

10:31.367 --> 10:32.425
No sweat glands.

10:32.635 --> 10:34.796
I think it's the right hunch.

10:35.004 --> 10:36.471
You want to look it up?

10:38.941 --> 10:41.842
Hold on. The EMS Medical Director's
a real person?

10:42.044 --> 10:43.341
He's an ER doctor.

10:43.546 --> 10:46.174
I thought it was just a name they
stuck on the top of memos.

10:46.382 --> 10:47.679
Not when I do it.

10:47.884 --> 10:48.873
Somebody page me?

10:49.085 --> 10:52.486
Yeah. Abdominal mass in Trauma 1.
It sounds like a triple-A.

10:53.089 --> 10:54.579
What? I pay attention.

10:54.791 --> 10:57.988
Carla called. She might not
come to Reece's ear appointment.

10:58.194 --> 11:00.162
She said to call
if that's a problem.

11:00.363 --> 11:01.694
No, that's cool.

11:01.898 --> 11:04.423
- What is it, 100 degrees in here?
- I'm on it.

11:04.634 --> 11:07.034
Dr. Carter, I'm sorry.
I was with Dr. Ross.

11:07.236 --> 11:08.897
- Coffee.
- For me?

11:09.105 --> 11:11.164
Imagine me on caffeine?
One sugar, right?

11:11.374 --> 11:13.501
Right. Thanks.

11:13.776 --> 11:15.903
Why am I signed up for two patients?

11:16.112 --> 11:19.240
I hope you don't mind.
The right-arm weakness is interesting.

11:19.449 --> 11:23.408
I ordered up the previous charts,
reviewed them and did the H & P.

11:23.619 --> 11:24.449
Already?

11:24.654 --> 11:27.817
To get a good Residency,
you gotta fly out of the gates.

11:28.024 --> 11:30.424
You got a little time before
worrying about that.

11:30.626 --> 11:32.025
Isn't it the same for you?

11:32.228 --> 11:34.594
- Residents buck for Chief as Interns?
- Right.

11:34.797 --> 11:37.664
You've probably been laying the
groundwork since day one.

11:38.334 --> 11:41.667
At school they say that's how you
build a career. Right, Dr. Carter?

11:41.871 --> 11:44.806
Don't call him "Dr. Carter."
There'll be no living with him.

11:45.007 --> 11:47.771
- What shall I call you?
- He's just Carter.

11:47.977 --> 11:50.343
Dr. Carter will be fine.

11:50.546 --> 11:53.014
Oh, God, yeah. Right there.

11:53.216 --> 11:55.741
I was so tense talking to Admin.

11:55.952 --> 11:58.978
- You didn't need to be.
- I should've asked for two nurses.

11:59.188 --> 12:00.348
You gonna hire yourself?

12:00.556 --> 12:02.524
I'm the only volunteer
I don't mind asking.

12:02.725 --> 12:05.216
Besides, it'll be fun to hire
someone good for the clinic.

12:05.428 --> 12:06.486
- Did I get it?
- Yeah.

12:06.696 --> 12:10.757
Double GSW, two 16-year-olds. One
shot in the head, one in the flank.

12:10.967 --> 12:12.525
Mark, did you answer the radio?

12:12.735 --> 12:14.168
All by myself.

12:15.771 --> 12:17.739
Single GSW to the left
temporal scalp.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.636
BP is 120/78. Pulse 80.

12:20.843 --> 12:23.175
No neurodeficits unless being
a macho jerk...

12:23.379 --> 12:25.574
...and attacking your friendly
paramedic counts.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.045
- She was going for my piece.
- No, your pulse.

12:28.251 --> 12:29.479
Bleed out next time.

12:29.685 --> 12:31.050
Get that lac taken care of.

12:31.254 --> 12:32.653
Doris, I'll look at it.
Let's go.

12:32.855 --> 12:35.551
There's no palpable bullet.
What's your name?

12:35.758 --> 12:38.056
Looks like he's been shot before.

12:38.261 --> 12:40.661
- First time above my neck.
- Well, you the man.

12:40.863 --> 12:43.423
Pupils are equal and reactive.
Know where you are?

12:43.633 --> 12:45.032
Sixteen-year-old
African-American male.

12:45.234 --> 12:47.361
Yo, Toine. What's up, man?
Where you been?

12:47.570 --> 12:50.004
Gunshot to the buttock.
Single entrance wound.

12:50.206 --> 12:51.605
Oh, they capped you in the ass?

12:51.807 --> 12:54.435
- Oh, that's whack, man.
- Nothing but a thang, B.G.

12:54.644 --> 12:56.544
On my count. One, two, three.

12:56.946 --> 12:58.413
There ought to be something to do.

12:58.614 --> 13:00.809
Maybe a central line,
maybe a chest tube.

13:01.017 --> 13:03.611
- I'm not ready for that yet.
- No, you aren't.

13:04.754 --> 13:07.416
- Pain here?
- No, man. I ain't shot there.

13:07.623 --> 13:08.817
Normal sinus on the scope.

13:09.025 --> 13:09.889
Need any help here?

13:10.092 --> 13:11.684
Dr. Carter, so glad you asked.

13:11.894 --> 13:14.124
Get some Surgilube
and a fresh pair of gloves.

13:14.330 --> 13:16.127
We'll check next door.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.624
- Tighter so I can't open them up.

13:19.835 --> 13:20.802
Anything we can do?

13:21.003 --> 13:23.665
No sister with no attitude's
putting a shot in my head.

13:23.873 --> 13:26.967
Close your eyes, sir. We're
checking your cranial nerves.

13:27.176 --> 13:30.543
Looks like they got it under control.
There'll be more chances.

13:30.746 --> 13:31.974
I know.

13:32.181 --> 13:35.082
Sure, the guidelines say wait
until the cops get there.

13:35.284 --> 13:36.945
Wait until the scene is secured.

13:37.153 --> 13:41.385
But when some kid is lying in
the street bleeding, what do you do?

13:41.591 --> 13:46.858
I'm curious because the department's
looking for a new medical director.

13:47.063 --> 13:48.257
You'd leave the ER?

13:48.464 --> 13:50.932
No, no. It would be part
of my job here.

13:51.133 --> 13:54.125
It would be a good way to approach
continuity of care.

13:54.337 --> 13:57.170
I hate to see it happen
to such a decent guy.

13:57.373 --> 13:58.397
What do you mean?

13:58.608 --> 14:01.202
Seven years I've been
working on a rig.

14:01.410 --> 14:04.004
We know that what we
need is more paramedics.

14:04.213 --> 14:06.408
And every year for seven years...

14:06.616 --> 14:08.481
Right, right. They cut the budget.

14:10.486 --> 14:13.387
That part of the job would not be new.

14:16.392 --> 14:17.984
Am I gonna have a scar?

14:18.194 --> 14:20.754
No. I'm too good at this.

14:20.997 --> 14:24.489
Get an abdominal CT with oral IV
and rectal contrast.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.430
If the bullet hit his colon,
you'd think he'd be hurting.

14:27.637 --> 14:29.229
The kid was masking his pain.

14:29.438 --> 14:30.427
How's yours doing?

14:30.640 --> 14:34.440
He's stable. No blood in the urine.
Stool trace positive for heme.

14:34.644 --> 14:37.408
I checked on your probation
and it ended yesterday.

14:37.613 --> 14:39.979
Well, I guess the party's over.

14:40.182 --> 14:43.982
The committee asked me to sign off
on your patients, I didn't want to.

14:44.186 --> 14:45.813
Yeah, but you got off on it, though.

14:46.022 --> 14:48.081
I do not relish babysitting.

14:48.290 --> 14:51.191
My life would be a lot easier
if everyone did their jobs.

14:51.394 --> 14:52.793
I'm sorry to be a burden.

14:52.995 --> 14:57.295
This all meant nothing to you, did it?
Just water under the bridge, right?

14:57.500 --> 14:59.161
I wouldn't say that.

14:59.368 --> 15:03.862
Do you know how many calls I get from
people who want ultra-rapid detox?

15:04.840 --> 15:05.864
Forward them to me.

15:06.108 --> 15:09.134
Yeah. Can't do that.
God knows what you'd say.

15:12.381 --> 15:16.477
I think it's a wise move for you.
Great research opportunities in EMS.

15:16.686 --> 15:19.018
I'm more interested in
coordinating paramedics.

15:19.221 --> 15:21.451
For once, we wouldn't be
in competition.

15:21.657 --> 15:23.386
Field work was never my forte.

15:23.592 --> 15:26.493
You wouldn't want this job.
There's no money, power or glory.

15:26.696 --> 15:29.358
It doesn't fit into my
Machiavellian scheme...

15:29.565 --> 15:31.999
...to rule the Emergency Department.
You going?

15:32.201 --> 15:34.465
Yeah, Rachel's got a soccer game.

15:37.540 --> 15:41.032
- Dr. Weaver, you have a minute?
- Sure. Jerry, it is freezing.

15:41.243 --> 15:42.369
I know.

15:42.878 --> 15:46.075
- Did you notice my salary request?
- I did.

15:46.282 --> 15:49.183
My finances have changed,
and it's no longer feasible...

15:49.385 --> 15:53.082
Yeah, I approved it. And, frankly,
I was glad to see it.

15:53.289 --> 15:56.918
If you practice medicine as a hobby,
you risk looking like a dilettante.

15:57.126 --> 16:00.061
Ah, yes. Well, that's not me.
It's not me.

16:00.262 --> 16:04.130
And that's what's been worrying me.
While I was unpaid, it held me back...

16:04.333 --> 16:05.800
...from stating my long-term goal.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.263
Which is?

16:07.603 --> 16:09.571
I want to be Chief Resident.

16:10.072 --> 16:11.937
You don't have to worry
about that yet.

16:12.141 --> 16:14.769
No? I want to come out
of the gate strong.

16:14.977 --> 16:16.604
It's the only way to build a career.

16:16.812 --> 16:19.645
Well, you're off to a good start
with your student.

16:19.849 --> 16:23.307
- Ms. Knight's organized and in control.
- Lucy's on top of it.

16:23.519 --> 16:25.817
A good student is
evidence of a good teacher...

16:26.021 --> 16:28.546
...and that's the first step toward
being a Chief.

16:30.159 --> 16:31.490
- I say, Jerry?
- I'm on it.

16:31.994 --> 16:32.961
They're turning it up now.

16:33.195 --> 16:34.958
Actually, I was asking
if you paged me.

16:35.164 --> 16:38.224
That was me. Where's the
man with the gunshot wound?

16:38.434 --> 16:39.765
Bangers to Curtain 3.

16:39.969 --> 16:42.597
Don't lead her by
the nose too much, your student.

16:42.805 --> 16:44.466
I will keep that in mind.

16:46.308 --> 16:48.538
Jerry, it's like a meat locker
in here.

16:50.546 --> 16:55.415
Nice work. Triple-A on an anterior
left renal vein is never a picnic.

16:55.618 --> 16:57.017
Yeah, divide and conquer.

16:57.219 --> 16:58.516
What are you doing at 4:00?

16:58.721 --> 17:01.849
I've got a tricky
retroperitoneal sarcoma.

17:02.057 --> 17:04.617
I'm taking my son upstairs
for an audiology exam...

17:04.827 --> 17:06.920
...but I guess I could reschedule.

17:07.128 --> 17:08.561
Your son have a hearing problem?

17:08.763 --> 17:12.426
There was a concern. He had fluid
in his ears, I'm just following up.

17:12.635 --> 17:14.626
But he tested normal at birth?

17:15.204 --> 17:17.297
- Wasn't he a preemie?
- Yeah. That's right.

17:17.506 --> 17:19.997
They sometimes give gent to preemies.

17:20.876 --> 17:22.969
It can be ototoxic.

17:24.079 --> 17:27.173
No, no. He's fine. I'll be there.

17:27.383 --> 17:29.476
Well, if you're sure.

17:29.685 --> 17:32.882
How would you like to follow up on
Mr. Specchierla in Recovery?

17:34.456 --> 17:35.946
Our triple-A?

17:36.158 --> 17:38.820
Oh, yeah. I'm on it.

17:40.963 --> 17:43.261
The CT scan showed a hole
in your rectum.

17:43.465 --> 17:45.626
They ripped you another one, Little T.

17:45.835 --> 17:47.063
My belly's hurting.

17:47.269 --> 17:49.362
I gave him six of morphine.

17:49.572 --> 17:51.267
Hey, man! Come check me out too.

17:51.473 --> 17:53.668
I don't want no dents in
my pretty head.

17:53.876 --> 17:54.968
Your head too big anyway.

17:55.511 --> 17:57.138
Are you gonna do my operation?

17:57.346 --> 17:59.974
You don't want no Chinese fag
messing down there.

18:00.182 --> 18:01.308
Japanese.

18:02.184 --> 18:05.620
Your friend could use a little support.
This isn't a joke.

18:05.821 --> 18:08.255
After surgery, you'll
wear a colostomy bag.

18:08.457 --> 18:09.981
- Do you know what that is?
- No.

18:10.192 --> 18:12.592
Lil Toine gonna be crapping
in a bag?

18:16.098 --> 18:17.861
You gonna be crapping in a bag!

18:18.300 --> 18:19.324
Not me, man.

18:19.535 --> 18:22.003
This is not an accurate picture of
a colostomy.

18:22.204 --> 18:24.638
Oh, baby. I heard they shot you.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.530
What you doing here, Moselle?

18:26.742 --> 18:28.972
- She come to see Toine.
- I don't think so.

18:29.178 --> 18:30.645
What business is it of yours?

18:30.846 --> 18:33.542
- This is my business, girl.
- Chill, girls, chill!

18:33.782 --> 18:36.979
Take it outside, both of you.
Now, go. Go.

18:38.187 --> 18:41.418
We'll explain the process
when your mother arrives. Okay?

18:43.025 --> 18:45.789
That's what happens when you
run, man. Booty call.

18:45.995 --> 18:48.589
Yosh, get these two in separate rooms.

18:48.797 --> 18:49.991
Gonna miss that, I bet.

18:50.199 --> 18:52.827
Actually, I will. He's just a boy.

18:53.035 --> 18:56.368
You know, I was really sorry to hear
that nothing worked out for you.

18:56.572 --> 18:58.972
I had my fingers crossed
for a faculty spot.

18:59.174 --> 19:00.471
Well, it wasn't meant to be.

19:00.676 --> 19:03.509
You know, I have heard
of foreign doctors...

19:03.712 --> 19:06.180
...who were willing to
start over as Interns.

19:06.382 --> 19:07.440
Oh, God.

19:07.650 --> 19:09.117
I know. I can't even imagine.

19:09.318 --> 19:13.379
Actually, I do have one last-ditch,
desperate chance in half an hour.

19:13.589 --> 19:14.487
Wish me luck.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.851
- I said, stay away from him!
- You stay away!

19:17.059 --> 19:18.720
Call Security!

19:20.729 --> 19:22.924
Hey! Hey! I said to take it outside!

19:23.132 --> 19:24.690
- Shut up!
- Take it out now!

19:24.900 --> 19:26.060
- Go!
- She crazy, man!

19:26.268 --> 19:27.394
I called Security.

19:27.603 --> 19:29.230
I'm calling the police.
Go, go!

19:29.471 --> 19:31.462
- Shut up!
- Now!

19:32.141 --> 19:33.733
Nice work, Kerry.

19:34.109 --> 19:35.667
Glad I stayed on your good side.

19:35.878 --> 19:39.336
Excuse me, nurse, I'm Mr. Savage.
I've been waiting a long time.

19:39.548 --> 19:41.607
Well, Mr. Savage, I am a doctor...

19:41.817 --> 19:43.250
...and you have to wait your turn.

19:43.452 --> 19:44.851
- You're not a nurse?
- Rob Savage.

19:45.054 --> 19:46.612
I have your chart right here.

19:47.923 --> 19:49.891
You can't smoke that in here.

19:50.993 --> 19:51.891
Follow me.

19:52.094 --> 19:56.155
Get this mess cleaned up, and have
Climate Control send down some parkas.

20:03.005 --> 20:04.597
Where's the Rowdies/Crush game?

20:04.807 --> 20:07.139
- Just started.
- I'm looking for my daughter.

20:07.343 --> 20:11.336
- There's girls in this league.
- She's not playing on a coed team.

20:11.547 --> 20:13.310
- Rachel?
- Go!

20:13.515 --> 20:16.109
Go all the way, Brandon! Take her!

20:16.318 --> 20:17.808
She can't stop you!

20:18.020 --> 20:19.351
Easy as pie!

20:19.555 --> 20:20.715
Hang in there, Rach!

20:20.923 --> 20:22.151
Take her! Take her!

20:22.358 --> 20:23.620
Tough D!

20:25.627 --> 20:27.993
- Where's the flag?
- Flag? Flag's right there.

20:28.197 --> 20:30.825
Penalty kick.
This one's yours, son.

20:31.066 --> 20:33.159
Easy point. She can't stop you!

20:33.369 --> 20:35.064
Goalie's a girl! Put her away!

20:35.270 --> 20:38.535
Hang in there, Rach!
This guy's got nothing!

20:38.741 --> 20:41.767
Don't worry, Rachel!
Hang in! You'll do fine!

20:44.513 --> 20:45.775
Hang tough!

20:52.287 --> 20:53.754
What happened?

20:57.026 --> 20:58.823
I need a first-aid kit!

21:03.332 --> 21:04.822
Sorry to kick so hard.

21:05.034 --> 21:06.126
It wasn't that hard.

21:06.335 --> 21:07.302
Hey, you okay?

21:07.503 --> 21:09.232
- Dad, you're here.
- Yeah.

21:09.438 --> 21:11.201
That was a great save.

21:11.407 --> 21:14.376
That first-aid kit was empty.
Does she want some ice?

21:14.576 --> 21:17.739
No. No. She's tough.

21:20.149 --> 21:22.413
Hey, you got leaves in your hair.

21:23.719 --> 21:26.688
I've had it before. I just can't pee.

21:26.955 --> 21:29.549
- How long has it been?
- About two and a half days.

21:29.825 --> 21:31.053
It's pretty uncomfortable.

21:31.260 --> 21:33.785
Put this gown on. I'll go
check with the doctor.

21:33.996 --> 21:36.464
- Last time they stuck this tube...
- Foley catheter?

21:36.665 --> 21:38.360
What are you doing?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.397
- Having a smoke.
- You can't smoke.

21:40.602 --> 21:42.229
Not even in here?

21:42.538 --> 21:46.235
No. Get undressed.
I'll be right back.

21:47.509 --> 21:48.942
Hold on. Hold on. I got you.

21:49.144 --> 21:51.135
- What's up?
- I got you. Multiple stab wounds.

21:51.346 --> 21:53.974
- She was out in the bay.
- Weaver kicked her out.

21:54.183 --> 21:56.617
- God!
- Know where she is?

21:56.819 --> 21:58.218
- No. I don't know.
- Page her!

22:00.856 --> 22:02.653
Peter? How have you been?

22:02.858 --> 22:06.089
Good. I was just checking something
on Reece's chart.

22:06.295 --> 22:08.559
- Is he having a problem?
- No, he's fine. Well...

22:08.764 --> 22:12.928
...he had an ear infection, but he
was given furosemide as a neonate.

22:13.135 --> 22:14.602
He had pulmonary edema.

22:14.803 --> 22:17.294
- And gentamicin, right?
- That's right.

22:18.307 --> 22:20.468
Was his hearing tested then?

22:21.210 --> 22:23.371
Right here. OAE, normal screening.

22:23.579 --> 22:27.174
Was that test done before or after
he received the ototoxic drugs?

22:27.382 --> 22:30.613
Both. Dosages were in the safe
therapeutic range.

22:30.819 --> 22:32.150
Does he have a hearing loss?

22:32.354 --> 22:35.187
No, no. I was just double-checking.

22:35.390 --> 22:36.288
Sorry to bother you.

22:36.492 --> 22:37.322
Not a bother.

22:37.526 --> 22:38.959
BP's up to 85.

22:39.161 --> 22:42.528
Chest tube's in.
Thora-Seal to suction.

22:42.731 --> 22:45.131
- Why put in a chest tube?
- To re-expand the lung.

22:45.334 --> 22:47.564
- Pulse ox is falling, 86.
- What the hell?

22:47.769 --> 22:50.169
Three hundred cc's of blood
out the chest tube.

22:50.372 --> 22:54.331
All right, let's check into the
hemoglobin. Lucy, draw the blood.

22:54.543 --> 22:55.942
- Me?
- Yeah.

22:57.379 --> 23:00.439
Look at that. Air bubbles.

23:01.049 --> 23:03.609
Sub-Q emphysema.
Air bubbles from the stab wound.

23:03.819 --> 23:05.446
There's no oxygen to her lungs.

23:05.654 --> 23:07.019
Lucy, get to work.

23:07.222 --> 23:08.450
One cc venous blood.

23:08.657 --> 23:11.057
Pulse ox is down to 83.
What's going on?

23:11.693 --> 23:15.151
She lacerated her right
mainstem bronchus. Stop bagging.

23:15.464 --> 23:18.024
- What are you doing?
- Lf I can intubate...

23:18.233 --> 23:21.498
...past the laceration, we shouldn't
have an air leak.

23:22.037 --> 23:24.870
- You're only ventilating one lung.
- Better than none.

23:25.073 --> 23:27.507
- Got it!
- I'll check the hemoglobin.

23:27.910 --> 23:29.309
Hey.

23:29.511 --> 23:31.536
Pulse ox is 90. No air leak.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.672
- Nice work.
- Nice work all around.

23:33.882 --> 23:36.316
Call Anesthesia. Tell them
we need a Carlen ET tube.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.816
- Hang on. Hemoglobin's 8.9.
- What?

23:39.855 --> 23:42.119
- What was it before?
- 13.7.

23:42.824 --> 23:44.883
She dropped the hemoglobin
five points?

23:45.093 --> 23:45.923
Hang on!

23:46.128 --> 23:47.720
She must've lacerated her liver.

23:47.930 --> 23:50.160
Hang two units of O-neg.
Call the O.R.

23:50.365 --> 23:53.391
Let me do another hemoglobin.
Machine wasn't calibrated.

23:53.602 --> 23:55.069
What is a sudden drop in crit?

23:55.270 --> 23:56.999
Intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

23:57.206 --> 23:59.470
- Her vitals are okay.
- Hold up on the O-neg.

24:03.345 --> 24:04.903
Hemoglobin's 12.8.

24:06.748 --> 24:08.010
That's more like it.

24:08.383 --> 24:11.409
Cancel the O.R. Send her to CT.
Get that machine checked out.

24:11.620 --> 24:12.587
Yeah.

24:12.788 --> 24:13.880
You having fun?

24:14.590 --> 24:15.955
Oh, yeah.

24:20.762 --> 24:22.787
I knew that. I knew it.

24:22.998 --> 24:26.126
Never do a blood draw above an IV.
The fluid dilutes the blood.

24:26.335 --> 24:27.495
That's right.

24:28.337 --> 24:30.328
Thank you for covering for me.

24:30.539 --> 24:33.337
I won't do it again. If you
don't know something, ask.

24:33.542 --> 24:34.702
You're learning.

24:34.910 --> 24:36.969
I know, but you're judged
from the word "go."

24:37.179 --> 24:38.669
I don't want to look incompetent.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.906
You are judged because
it's life or death in here.

24:43.051 --> 24:47.784
I know. I just didn't think I'd have
so much trouble with procedures.

24:47.990 --> 24:50.959
Your problem is you want
to be perfect. Get over it.

24:51.159 --> 24:53.719
You're a beginner.
It's not gonna be easy.

24:53.929 --> 24:57.626
Last night I went to the Procedures
Lab and I practiced my IVs.

24:57.833 --> 25:00.028
I got them right every time
on the first try.

25:00.235 --> 25:03.636
That's good. You keep it up.
But know when to ask for help.

25:03.839 --> 25:05.636
You guys just missed a good one.

25:05.841 --> 25:08.275
Sent a guy to the O.R.
Carrot perfed his intestine.

25:08.477 --> 25:09.671
A whole carrot?

25:09.878 --> 25:11.869
How do you swallow a whole carrot?

25:15.417 --> 25:17.078
He didn't swallow.

25:18.820 --> 25:19.809
Oh, I get it.

25:21.690 --> 25:22.714
Oh, God.

25:22.924 --> 25:24.858
"Swallowed a carrot."

25:25.193 --> 25:26.683
That is a classic, Lucy.

25:26.895 --> 25:29.830
Hey, can you work up this
shoulder injury for me?

25:30.432 --> 25:31.421
Yeah.

25:33.201 --> 25:34.668
I lucked out with her, didn't I?

25:34.870 --> 25:36.838
I like her, but she's
still a beginner.

25:37.072 --> 25:39.233
- What do you mean?
- She's getting her bearings.

25:39.474 --> 25:41.101
She needs guidance in procedures.

25:41.310 --> 25:43.005
Come on. Relax, Carol.

25:43.211 --> 25:45.145
Lucy's a natural.
Hell, I'm jealous too.

25:45.347 --> 25:47.815
No, no. Carter, you're way
off base.

25:48.016 --> 25:50.007
I'm not jealous at all. L...

25:50.919 --> 25:54.013
I don't believe this. Excuse me.

25:56.992 --> 25:59.984
Mr. Savage, what part of "No
smoking" didn't you understand?

26:00.195 --> 26:01.992
I have to go now. My nurse is here.

26:02.197 --> 26:05.166
Give it to me.
What are you, an idiot?

26:05.434 --> 26:07.299
The doctor said
I need a Foley catheter.

26:07.502 --> 26:09.197
You won't want me to put it in.

26:09.438 --> 26:11.303
- I'll be good.
- Hand it over.

26:11.673 --> 26:14.267
- Come on. The whole pack.
- Why?

26:14.476 --> 26:15.909
Because I said so.

26:17.879 --> 26:20.905
I'm not gonna wrestle you.
Give me the cigarettes.

26:22.684 --> 26:24.276
Now, lie back.

26:26.588 --> 26:28.715
What about a rectal?

26:29.024 --> 26:30.184
That's next.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.184
Will it hurt?

26:34.196 --> 26:36.027
Only if I want it to.

26:38.500 --> 26:39.728
Aesop, move in.

26:44.039 --> 26:45.131
Stop.

26:45.540 --> 26:47.701
<i>- Standing by.</i>
- Move left.

26:48.710 --> 26:51.008
- Stop.
- That is a perfect view.

26:51.213 --> 26:55.274
- The arm responds whenever addressed.
- I'm gonna zap this adhesion.

26:55.484 --> 26:57.577
Hold on. Everybody protected?

26:58.120 --> 26:59.417
Okay, looks good.

26:59.621 --> 27:01.054
Shooting.

27:01.990 --> 27:03.423
Isn't it risky to use a laser...

27:03.625 --> 27:05.320
...when contact cautery would do?

27:05.527 --> 27:07.688
Well, you do have to be
precise shooting.

27:07.896 --> 27:11.832
But you can avoid inadvertent burns.
Angie?

27:12.501 --> 27:14.765
Which you can have with a Bovie.

27:15.337 --> 27:18.306
Still, I wouldn't want a
KTP laser in the wrong hands.

27:18.573 --> 27:20.404
And elevate the gall bladder.

27:22.377 --> 27:23.742
<i>Standing by.</i>

27:25.480 --> 27:27.345
Aesop, move back.

27:28.250 --> 27:29.444
Stop.

27:30.719 --> 27:32.448
You make it look easy, Dr. Corday.

27:32.654 --> 27:35.521
Bet she can walk and chew gum
at the same time too.

27:36.091 --> 27:37.820
Oh, she can.

27:39.294 --> 27:40.659
<i>Standing by.</i>

27:40.862 --> 27:42.796
She's been stridorous for a month?

27:44.166 --> 27:45.599
The high-pitched wheezing?

27:45.801 --> 27:46.893
At least.

27:47.302 --> 27:49.270
Why did you wait to bring her in?

27:50.405 --> 27:54.364
The other hospital gave her stuff
for croup, but it didn't help.

27:54.576 --> 27:55.634
Go like this:

27:56.878 --> 27:59.540
What kind of stuff? Steroids?
Antibiotics?

28:00.882 --> 28:02.281
One of them was pink.

28:02.484 --> 28:05.783
I don't see edema or swelling.
Did she swallow something?

28:06.455 --> 28:08.423
Maybe. I can't watch her
every moment.

28:08.623 --> 28:11.148
Excuse me. Someone wants
to see you, Doug.

28:11.359 --> 28:13.850
- I'm with a patient.
- He's quite insistent.

28:14.062 --> 28:15.086
Okay.

28:15.997 --> 28:19.433
We'll do some x-rays of the neck
and chest to look for an obstruction.

28:19.634 --> 28:22.194
If I don't see anything, we'll
do an endoscopy...

28:22.404 --> 28:25.601
...take a look down the throat.
I'll be right back.

28:26.208 --> 28:29.006
If you said that to get
a reaction, I'm not biting.

28:29.211 --> 28:30.337
Said what?

28:30.545 --> 28:32.604
Endoscopy? That's pretty invasive.

28:32.814 --> 28:34.714
Kid's been stridorous for a month.

28:35.450 --> 28:38.010
Carter, can I borrow Lucy
for a minute?

28:38.220 --> 28:40.415
- Sure.
- Mr. Savage needs an IV.

28:40.655 --> 28:41.485
Oh?

28:41.690 --> 28:43.351
Don't worry.
He's a pain in the ass.

28:43.558 --> 28:45.526
Doesn't feel a thing.
He's perfect for you.

28:45.727 --> 28:47.456
- It's you?
- That's right.

28:47.662 --> 28:49.254
I want the treatment.

28:49.464 --> 28:50.624
I'm a pediatrician.

28:50.832 --> 28:53.733
- You got that baby clean.
- I'll give you names of clinics.

28:53.935 --> 28:56.062
I can't afford a clinic.
You charge the kid?

28:56.271 --> 28:58.569
- That was special.
- No, I'm special!

28:58.773 --> 29:01.071
- Maybe I don't look it...
- I don't treat adults.

29:01.276 --> 29:04.336
- She said that only you do it.
- I don't do it.

29:04.546 --> 29:06.241
Sit and I'll get you some numbers...

29:06.448 --> 29:08.848
I don't want numbers!
I want that detox!

29:09.050 --> 29:10.142
You've made your point.

29:10.352 --> 29:13.719
I'm not making a point.
It's a real fallout of your actions.

29:14.256 --> 29:16.190
Send all the requests my way.

29:16.391 --> 29:18.882
- A journal article...
- He doesn't read journals.

29:19.094 --> 29:20.493
Justify your decision.

29:20.695 --> 29:22.959
I'm not interested in
justifying anything.

29:23.164 --> 29:26.031
I'm concerned about false hopes
from one good outcome.

29:26.234 --> 29:28.668
Was it good?
Mother and baby are doing well?

29:29.070 --> 29:30.367
As far as I know, yes.

29:30.572 --> 29:33.040
Follow-up care is not part
of your measures.

29:33.241 --> 29:34.799
I am an ER doc, just like you.

29:35.010 --> 29:38.946
Not like me, Doug. You acted without
the consent of your colleagues.

29:44.252 --> 29:45.082
What have we got?

29:45.287 --> 29:46.845
Thirteen-year-old karate student.

29:47.055 --> 29:49.353
Collapsed after instructor's
demo kick to the chest.

29:49.558 --> 29:51.822
Firefighters were first on the scene.
They started CPR.

29:52.027 --> 29:53.892
We arrived on the scene about eight
minutes after the call.

29:54.095 --> 29:56.222
Found him apneic and pulseless
with rhythm of V-fib.

29:56.431 --> 29:58.797
- The teacher?
- Drove behind. Parents are coming.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.467
- How long en route?
- Seven minutes.

30:00.669 --> 30:03.001
About 15 minutes at the scene.
Been down for 30.

30:03.204 --> 30:05.604
Okay, let's go. One, two, three.

30:05.807 --> 30:09.072
Yosh, take over compressions.
Get him on a monitor.

30:09.277 --> 30:10.767
Stand by with high-dose epi.

30:11.012 --> 30:13.572
- Good breath sounds.
- Nice intubation, Zadro.

30:13.782 --> 30:15.181
Hold compressions.

30:15.383 --> 30:16.907
Is it sudden-death condition?

30:17.118 --> 30:19.951
- I'm not sure, Curtis. Maybe.
- Asystole.

30:20.155 --> 30:24.558
Resume compressions. Give him
the epi, four milligrams IV.

30:24.759 --> 30:26.386
Pupils fixed and dilated.

30:26.595 --> 30:27.926
Should've driven to the morgue.

30:28.129 --> 30:30.962
Get the external pacemaker.
Put on the pacing pad.

30:32.033 --> 30:36.026
Carol. Harriet Goodwyn,
Mr. Savage's private-duty nurse.

30:36.237 --> 30:38.330
He called a while ago.
Have I missed him?

30:38.540 --> 30:39.734
No, he's still here.

30:39.941 --> 30:42.000
Did he already have a Foley cath?

30:42.210 --> 30:44.701
Well, he complained of
inability to urinate.

30:44.913 --> 30:46.938
I'm sorry he did this.

30:47.148 --> 30:48.080
Did what?

30:48.283 --> 30:50.114
Mr. Savage has a problem.

30:50.318 --> 30:54.914
He enjoys procedures, especially
when administered by a nurse.

30:55.123 --> 30:56.954
Oh, my God.
I sent a student in there.

30:57.158 --> 30:58.182
Don't scold him.

30:58.393 --> 31:01.191
- I already did that.
- That's what he wants.

31:01.396 --> 31:04.422
- I'm sorry. I can't get it.
- Try the foot.

31:07.202 --> 31:08.794
Lucy, you can stop now.

31:09.004 --> 31:11.097
- Mr. Savage?
- Nurse Goodwyn.

31:11.306 --> 31:12.364
I couldn't get it.

31:12.574 --> 31:14.906
- He doesn't need it.
- Maybe if you show me again?

31:15.110 --> 31:18.238
I'll show you later, okay?
Doug Ross is looking for you.

31:19.714 --> 31:21.341
It's not Saturday, is it?

31:21.549 --> 31:22.447
It's Thursday.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.812
I just saw you yesterday.
Couldn't you wait?

31:26.655 --> 31:28.714
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Psych.

31:28.923 --> 31:31.255
I can handle this.

31:32.060 --> 31:34.824
Hello. I need a Psych consult
to the ER.

31:35.030 --> 31:36.497
Thank you.

31:36.998 --> 31:39.398
- Will you take me home?
- We'll see.

31:39.601 --> 31:41.728
Release him to me. It's no sweat.

31:41.936 --> 31:45.428
- You're not a real RN, are you?
- My clients like to think I am.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.866
You might want to see Psych yourself.

31:50.545 --> 31:54.447
Hey, it works for me.
I'm in control.

31:56.384 --> 31:58.511
Yeah. Right.

31:58.953 --> 32:03.583
Coach was going crazy. Kept saying,
"I barely hit him." 13 years old.

32:03.792 --> 32:08.525
Happened to my daughter. She got hit
in the park. No first aid anywhere.

32:09.631 --> 32:12.691
For commotio cordis, you have to
get hit right in the chest?

32:12.901 --> 32:14.266
Yeah. It's about timing.

32:14.469 --> 32:18.530
There's a split-second upstroke
when the heartbeat resets itself.

32:18.740 --> 32:23.507
In that instant, a blow will send
the heart into fibrillation.

32:23.712 --> 32:26.442
So by the time we got there...

32:26.681 --> 32:29.411
Don't fire trucks carry automated
defibrillators?

32:29.617 --> 32:30.948
This one didn't.

32:32.220 --> 32:34.154
There's something we could change.

32:36.091 --> 32:38.082
We're moving
to the higher frequencies.

32:38.293 --> 32:39.385
Okay.

32:39.828 --> 32:42.023
You may want your earplugs,
Dr. Benton.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.061
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.593
4-K at 100.

32:50.972 --> 32:52.337
That's a funny bear, huh?

32:52.540 --> 32:54.701
Please don't speak during the test.

32:55.510 --> 32:56.499
Sorry.

32:57.712 --> 32:59.839
4-K at 90.

33:07.489 --> 33:10.014
4-K at 80.

33:14.963 --> 33:17.193
Reece? Come on, man. Pay attention.

33:18.299 --> 33:20.267
4-K at 85.

33:24.272 --> 33:25.705
Moving to the 8-K frequency.

33:25.907 --> 33:27.670
8-K at 90.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.469
Let's try again.

33:43.458 --> 33:44.755
Glad they found you.

33:44.959 --> 33:47.120
I was on my way out
when I got the page.

33:47.328 --> 33:50.229
Not as sexy as our afternoon
with Aesop, but hey...

33:50.431 --> 33:52.729
...even a gangbanger shot
in the butt has needs.

33:52.934 --> 33:54.925
Yeah. I met him earlier.

33:55.303 --> 33:59.569
You were outstanding with Aesop.
I rethought my decision to let you go.

33:59.774 --> 34:00.763
You did?

34:00.975 --> 34:04.877
I even called upstairs. Unfortunately,
the money's no longer there.

34:06.247 --> 34:07.544
I see.

34:08.283 --> 34:11.581
Well, maybe you should apply again
next year. Ready?

34:11.786 --> 34:12.878
Sure.

34:14.956 --> 34:16.924
All right. Why are we scoping her?

34:17.125 --> 34:21.186
Her films were negative, and sometimes
plastics don't show up on x-rays.

34:21.396 --> 34:24.524
You hear the one about the patient
that swallowed a carrot?

34:24.732 --> 34:26.290
Dr. Carter told you?

34:26.501 --> 34:28.900
- No, Jerry told me.
- Great.

34:29.536 --> 34:31.094
I found the mom.
She's on the phone.

34:31.306 --> 34:32.739
We're gonna have to talk to her.

34:32.940 --> 34:34.306
Take a look at that.

34:35.710 --> 34:38.610
It's a classic case of
pedunculated papilloma.

34:38.913 --> 34:40.972
Her mother had a sexually
transmitted disease...

34:41.181 --> 34:43.309
...and the baby caught it through
the birth canal?

34:43.518 --> 34:44.917
Gold star.

34:46.987 --> 34:49.217
No small bowel injuries.
We're ready for the colostomy.

34:49.424 --> 34:53.053
Hold on. The path of the bullet is
awfully close to the ureter.

34:53.261 --> 34:56.321
Janet, I need an amp
of IV methylene blue.

34:56.531 --> 34:58.226
Looks like the bullet
cleared the ureter.

34:58.433 --> 35:02.369
Sometimes you can't see a tear close
to the UV junction. Fresh lap pad.

35:02.637 --> 35:05.003
I'd argue, but I've seen
their soccer fans.

35:05.206 --> 35:06.867
GAA stapler, please.

35:08.343 --> 35:11.107
If you're dreading your dinner with
your dad, we can delay.

35:11.312 --> 35:13.337
I look forward to dinner
with my father.

35:13.848 --> 35:14.940
I need suction.

35:15.149 --> 35:16.514
Suctioning.

35:18.686 --> 35:21.746
So I expect your father's
eager to have you back.

35:21.956 --> 35:23.423
Didn't he want you in his practice?

35:23.625 --> 35:26.093
He's made that offer before, yes.

35:26.394 --> 35:29.329
Kocher. Terrific specialty,
the heart.

35:29.530 --> 35:32.465
Very romantic, but working with
a family member...

35:32.667 --> 35:34.328
- Shall I Bovie?
- Please do.

35:34.535 --> 35:36.162
I couldn't do it, work with family.

35:36.371 --> 35:37.998
Robert, you can't work with anyone.

35:39.274 --> 35:42.505
Doctor, there's blue urine
in the Foley bag.

35:44.779 --> 35:45.837
Let's check.

35:47.882 --> 35:52.319
Well, I'll be damned. I guess the
bullet nicked the ureter after all.

35:57.792 --> 35:59.487
Is she okay? I want to see her.

35:59.694 --> 36:01.161
She's fine. She's resting.

36:01.362 --> 36:04.729
Ms. Brown, were you ever diagnosed
with genital warts?

36:05.633 --> 36:06.759
What's this about?

36:06.968 --> 36:10.062
Ever been treated for
a sexually transmitted disease?

36:10.805 --> 36:11.863
None of your business.

36:12.073 --> 36:16.169
Did you know a C-section prevents you
from giving the illness to your child?

36:16.377 --> 36:17.537
What are you saying?

36:17.745 --> 36:20.236
You infected your daughter
with papilloma...

36:20.448 --> 36:22.575
My daughter...

36:22.784 --> 36:24.274
...is adopted.

36:33.127 --> 36:35.960
Ms. Brown, I owe you an apology.

36:38.766 --> 36:42.566
The loss is more profound at the higher
frequencies. That's a common finding.

36:42.770 --> 36:46.137
In lower pitches, Reece begins
perception at 70 decibels...

36:46.341 --> 36:48.502
...which is considered a severe loss.

36:48.710 --> 36:50.473
Shouldn't a doctor take
a look at that?

36:50.678 --> 36:52.737
He will. And he'll want
to meet with you.

36:52.947 --> 36:54.938
But I know you wanted the results.

36:55.149 --> 36:57.174
Yeah, I did. Look, I mean...

36:57.418 --> 37:01.252
...you're jumping to conclusions
after one subjective test.

37:02.357 --> 37:05.793
The good news is that Reece tests
within the aidable range.

37:05.994 --> 37:09.828
With digital hearing aids, he'll
come up into this speech banana.

37:10.031 --> 37:14.468
In this range, he could develop
language skills.

37:14.769 --> 37:15.599
"Could"?

37:17.505 --> 37:20.338
Reece can't hear talking, crying
or the telephone.

37:20.541 --> 37:23.101
It's a severe-to-profound loss.

37:25.213 --> 37:26.771
You're saying this after one test.

37:26.981 --> 37:28.778
Reece wouldn't even wear the headset.

37:28.983 --> 37:29.972
Most toddlers won't.

37:30.184 --> 37:32.448
Two weeks ago ENT said it was
an ear infection.

37:32.653 --> 37:34.382
But his ears are clear now.

37:34.589 --> 37:39.026
I don't want to argue with you, okay?
I just want to talk to a doctor.

37:39.227 --> 37:41.752
- As soon as possible.
- Okay, we'll set that up.

37:42.764 --> 37:43.822
Did I miss Doug?

37:44.032 --> 37:44.862
Yeah, just.

37:45.066 --> 37:47.626
He went up to Pedes
to talk to Alex Babcock.

37:47.835 --> 37:50.235
The pediatric anesthesiologist?
What's that about?

37:50.438 --> 37:52.201
You'd probably have to ask him that.

37:52.407 --> 37:54.671
You know, you are so right.

37:55.743 --> 37:59.645
Tell him I can't make it tomorrow.
Rachel's got soccer practice.

37:59.847 --> 38:00.711
Good for you.

38:00.915 --> 38:02.780
Has anybody noticed
the temperature in here?

38:02.984 --> 38:05.350
It feels like
a perfect 72 degrees.

38:05.553 --> 38:06.485
I was thinking it's...

38:06.687 --> 38:07.676
- Stuffy.
- Chilly.

38:07.889 --> 38:10.357
- Good day today. Don't work late.
- I won't.

38:10.558 --> 38:12.651
- Gotta be bright-eyed tomorrow.
- I will be.

38:12.927 --> 38:14.019
Did you even eat today?

38:14.228 --> 38:16.389
If you're hungry,
I didn't finish my lunch.

38:16.597 --> 38:19.794
- Oh, no. I'm okay.
- Well, all I have is a carrot.

38:20.935 --> 38:22.425
Okay. So I'm an idiot.

38:22.637 --> 38:24.696
- What's up?
<i>- Ma Íana.</i>

38:29.610 --> 38:30.770
- Carol?
- That's me.

38:30.978 --> 38:34.675
Lynette Evans. I've been working per
diem up on the third floor.

38:35.183 --> 38:37.481
Don Anspaugh hasn't told you
a word about me yet.

38:37.685 --> 38:38.743
I'm afraid not.

38:38.953 --> 38:41.513
What can you expect of Admin
but to drop the ball?

38:41.722 --> 38:45.783
He was supposed to blow my horn
so I wouldn't have to myself.

38:45.993 --> 38:49.087
There's an opening for
a nurse practitioner in your clinic?

38:49.297 --> 38:52.061
I'd settle for an RN.
Our budget got approved today.

38:52.266 --> 38:55.997
A nurse practitioner, which I am,
would serve you better...

38:56.204 --> 38:59.935
...since I can write prescriptions.
I know you can't always call a doc.

39:00.141 --> 39:01.733
Have you worked here already?

39:01.943 --> 39:05.276
No, I ran my own clinic at Southside.
That's where I know Don.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.675
Right. I heard about that clinic.

39:07.882 --> 39:11.318
Bye for now, suckers.
See you next time.

39:11.519 --> 39:13.817
Are you talking to anybody
in particular?

39:14.021 --> 39:16.888
You addressing the nurses and doctors
who took care of you?

39:17.091 --> 39:18.422
Did you fall on that head?

39:18.626 --> 39:19.718
No, I got shot.

39:19.927 --> 39:21.394
I beg your pardon?

39:21.596 --> 39:23.029
I got shot, ma'am.

39:23.231 --> 39:27.292
Then I think you'd better say,
"Thank you for saving my sorry life."

39:27.502 --> 39:28.491
She wasn't my nurse.

39:28.703 --> 39:32.230
At the rate you're going,
she will be next time. Just say it.

39:34.208 --> 39:37.234
- Thank you for saving my life.
- You're welcome.

39:40.815 --> 39:44.546
All that boy needs is somebody to
smack him upside his head.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.054
Here's my number. Keep me in mind.

39:48.256 --> 39:49.518
I will.

39:51.025 --> 39:52.322
In fact...

39:54.095 --> 39:55.585
...I think you're great.

39:57.331 --> 40:02.234
Actually, I shouldn't waste our time.
I'm just going to...

40:02.436 --> 40:04.404
I'll hire you right now.

40:04.605 --> 40:06.573
I'm gonna like your style.

40:06.774 --> 40:09.299
Great. Good.

40:09.510 --> 40:11.740
Adele Neuman thought
you'd know something.

40:11.946 --> 40:13.436
Is Adele the social worker?

40:13.648 --> 40:18.347
I called her when the mom failed to
bring the baby in for a follow-up.

40:18.553 --> 40:20.020
That was two weeks ago.

40:20.421 --> 40:22.946
- So they disappeared?
- It's not bad news.

40:23.157 --> 40:24.556
The mom's a junkie.

40:24.759 --> 40:28.661
She had a sister in the Carolinas
who sounded pretty stable.

40:28.863 --> 40:31.331
For Josh's sake, I'm hoping
that's where they wound up.

40:31.532 --> 40:33.830
I'm just lucky she
doesn't want to sue me.

40:34.035 --> 40:36.799
She appreciated what you did
for her baby.

40:37.004 --> 40:40.496
- Enough to take care of him herself?
- Dr. Ross?

40:40.975 --> 40:43.466
Remember me? You're Dr. Ross, right?

40:43.678 --> 40:45.839
Yeah. You're the skateboard
champ, right?

40:46.047 --> 40:48.379
Fractured arm?
Good thing you wore a helmet.

40:48.583 --> 40:51.017
- Yeah, that's me.
- What are you doing here?

40:51.219 --> 40:53.050
You should've seen Ruben two days ago.

40:53.254 --> 40:55.279
- My arm was killing me.
- Yeah?

40:55.489 --> 40:58.515
You couldn't even touch
me like that, it hurt so bad.

40:58.726 --> 41:00.785
Yeah, you were in rough shape.

41:01.329 --> 41:02.591
From the fracture?

41:02.797 --> 41:04.731
Been on morphine for months.
No relief.

41:04.932 --> 41:07.059
- Sounds like neuropathic pain.
- Exactly.

41:07.268 --> 41:09.964
My brain was like, getting its
signals crossed.

41:10.171 --> 41:11.103
Switch to gabapentin.

41:11.305 --> 41:15.401
Yep. Gotta know what kind of pain
you're dealing with.

41:17.011 --> 41:19.809
So, what you're saying is,
you saved two lives today.

41:20.014 --> 41:24.678
I saved the boy from sepsis and
a second trip to the O.R., at least.

41:24.885 --> 41:27.183
To a wonderful doctor.

41:30.691 --> 41:32.818
And a partner I'd be proud to have.

41:35.296 --> 41:38.959
Actually, Daddy, I'm gonna
have to turn you down.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.190
I know this doesn't make much sense.

41:42.169 --> 41:44.364
But I have given it a lot of thought.

41:46.073 --> 41:48.473
After we sewed up that gangbanger...

41:48.676 --> 41:51.611
It wasn't a fancy save or high-tech.

41:51.812 --> 41:56.146
In fact, it was the kind of surgery
one could almost do as an Intern.

41:57.418 --> 42:00.012
You're not thinking of starting
all over again?

42:00.655 --> 42:05.820
Why not? I mean, yes, it
will be a blow to my ego.

42:06.027 --> 42:08.996
But on the other hand, I'll be
practicing medicine still.

42:10.898 --> 42:12.627
It's not so shabby, saving lives.

42:13.367 --> 42:16.461
And it's a means to what I really
want, which is to stay here.

42:18.906 --> 42:21.841
How much does Peter Benton
figure in this plan?

42:22.476 --> 42:26.105
I have to be a little protective
after he stood us up tonight.

42:28.616 --> 42:32.017
Peter's complicated.
He had something else on his mind.

42:32.219 --> 42:35.017
And you know I'd never make
a decision based on a man.

42:36.324 --> 42:37.552
That said...

42:42.330 --> 42:43.763
I don't know what to say.

42:44.965 --> 42:47.490
I couldn't tolerate going back
to the beginning...

42:47.702 --> 42:50.296
...once I'd finished the fifth year.

42:51.539 --> 42:55.100
It's only for a year. Then I'll
have a license to practice here.

42:57.478 --> 42:58.911
Does it seem like I'm giving up?

42:59.113 --> 43:03.106
On the contrary, I've never
seen you fight harder.

43:04.218 --> 43:05.446
Thank you.

44:06.881 --> 44:07.870
Reece.

44:21.929 --> 44:23.055
Come on, man.
