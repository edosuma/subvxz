00:04.670 --> 00:07.480
Good morning, sunshine. How
was your night in the yard?

00:07.550 --> 00:09.450
Perfect. I like
sleeping outside.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.390
Mm-hmm.

00:11.460 --> 00:12.690
Haley lost her keys again.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.060
She's been going through
this irresponsible phase.

00:15.130 --> 00:18.300
Yeah, for 25 years. I'm not
gonna let her get to 26.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.010
Just to be clear,
Claire's not going
to kill her.

00:23.570 --> 00:25.620
Let me in! Please!

00:25.690 --> 00:26.890
No.
Please?

00:26.950 --> 00:29.320
This is just like when we
Ferberized her as a baby.

00:29.390 --> 00:31.890
Let her cry it out.
She'll settle down.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.590
Why?!

00:33.680 --> 00:35.650
What if I just throw
a blanket out there?

00:35.710 --> 00:37.080
Something that smells
like us.

00:37.150 --> 00:40.550
You can't leave me out here!
It's 2:00 in the morning!

00:40.620 --> 00:42.550
I have to change
for a party.

00:42.620 --> 00:44.420
Good night, honey.

00:59.420 --> 01:01.440
Morning, Phil.
No!

01:01.510 --> 01:02.690
It's not a --

01:02.760 --> 01:03.690
It's not a good morning.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.390
It's gonna be
an even worse day.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.930
Every morning,
before I shower,
I kick off my underwear.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.330
If I catch it,
it's gonna be a great day.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.500
If I don't...

01:11.520 --> 01:12.670
No!

01:12.730 --> 01:13.980
...disaster.

01:14.020 --> 01:15.720
I know that sounds crazy,
but it's an old family ritual

01:15.820 --> 01:18.220
my grandfather did
until the day he died --

01:18.290 --> 01:22.410
a day -- you guessed it --
that he dropped his underwear.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.660
I don't know what happened.

01:23.730 --> 01:24.730
It was a strong kick,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.230
ankle flick was on point.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.160
It is just
a ridiculous superstition.

01:28.230 --> 01:29.450
Ridiculous? Let's review.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.180
They day I Rollerbladed
into bees --

01:31.250 --> 01:32.600
I dropped my underwear.
Mm.

01:32.670 --> 01:34.720
The night I Rollerbladed
into that campfire --

01:34.790 --> 01:35.870
How about you
stop Rollerblading?

01:35.940 --> 01:38.270
How about I stop breathing?

01:38.340 --> 01:39.780
When I miss my catch,
the best thing I can do

01:39.840 --> 01:41.480
is just wait it out
in a safe place.

01:41.550 --> 01:42.900
Unh-unh. Not today.
No, no, no.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.160
We have a ton of errands
to get done

01:44.230 --> 01:45.670
before we go see
Steely Dan this afternoon.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.980
What time is that?
3:00 p.m.

01:47.050 --> 01:47.930
Why is it so --

01:48.000 --> 01:49.640
They are not young men, Phil.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.590
Great. My phone is broken,
and it's your fault.

01:52.660 --> 01:53.660
How do you figure that?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.180
Because I had to throw it
at some squirrels last night

01:55.240 --> 01:56.510
to keep them
from attacking me.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.960
You guys have to buy me
a new one.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.730
Costing me money.
It's already happening.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.850
No, it's not
costing you money

02:00.920 --> 02:02.300
because we are not
buying her a new phone.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.170
What?!

02:03.230 --> 02:04.550
But I need it for work.

02:04.570 --> 02:06.350
I sit on a stupid
golf course all day.

02:06.420 --> 02:07.520
What else am I
supposed to look at?

02:07.590 --> 02:08.720
You can have a new phone

02:08.789 --> 02:10.320
when you can afford
a new phone.

02:10.410 --> 02:12.080
Phil, would you cut
and toast those bagels?

02:12.140 --> 02:13.580
With the knife?

02:13.660 --> 02:15.760
Sweetie, here are
the spare keys.

02:15.830 --> 02:17.250
I would like you to make
yourself a copy.

02:17.310 --> 02:18.870
I can't wait to find out

02:19.030 --> 02:20.600
how you lose those.

02:20.670 --> 02:22.840
No wonder the neighbors think
you're so mean.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.920
You hear everything
when you sleep outside.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.600
Gloria!

02:35.220 --> 02:36.080
I was just out in the garage.

02:36.150 --> 02:37.270
Is there anything

02:37.330 --> 02:38.540
you want to tell me?

02:38.600 --> 02:39.400
Ah, yes.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.550
I got rid of

02:40.610 --> 02:41.620
your exercise machine.

02:41.690 --> 02:43.110
It was a piece of junk.

02:43.170 --> 02:44.910
You owe me and Chuck Norris
an apology.

02:44.980 --> 02:47.490
But I'm talking about
the dent in your car.

02:47.560 --> 02:48.330
Did you hit something

02:48.400 --> 02:49.480
we can talk about,

02:49.550 --> 02:50.580
or should I hose the front

02:50.650 --> 02:51.660
and find a body shop

02:51.780 --> 02:52.780
that doesn't ask questions?

02:52.780 --> 02:54.220
I didn't hit anything.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.120
Someone must have hit me when

02:56.190 --> 02:58.190
I was inside the store
with Joe.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.640
But talking about accidents,

02:59.710 --> 03:02.260
if your dog pees one more time

03:02.260 --> 03:03.480
in one of my slippers,

03:03.540 --> 03:04.640
I may accidentally

03:04.710 --> 03:05.830
leave her at the beach.

03:05.900 --> 03:06.950
I would never let that happen.

03:07.010 --> 03:08.770
And don't lash out at her.

03:08.830 --> 03:09.800
If you crashed the car,

03:09.870 --> 03:10.950
just tell me.

03:11.020 --> 03:12.150
I didn't.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.050
And I don't appreciate
being called a liar.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.000
Are you kidding?

03:15.070 --> 03:16.110
You can never admit

03:16.170 --> 03:17.360
to making a mistake,

03:17.430 --> 03:18.210
and it drives me crazy.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.540
Remember that romantic trip

03:19.610 --> 03:21.230
we took to Rome, Indiana?

03:21.300 --> 03:22.650
That's where I wanted to go.

03:22.710 --> 03:23.900
I meant to buy those tickets.

03:23.960 --> 03:25.150
Then why did you
learn Italian?

03:25.220 --> 03:26.430
<i>Mamma mia,</i> Jay.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.000
If I had been in an accident,

03:28.070 --> 03:29.370
I will admit it.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.990
Now, I have to go

03:31.060 --> 03:33.410
and buy more slippers online.

03:33.470 --> 03:35.140
Try not to crash the computer.

03:35.210 --> 03:36.210
Hey, Cam.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.180
So, the towel girl at the gym

03:38.250 --> 03:39.610
said that I look like

03:39.680 --> 03:40.880
an old Prince Harry.

03:40.950 --> 03:41.980
Shh! Shh!

03:42.050 --> 03:43.080
Oh, come on.

03:43.150 --> 03:44.350
Are you eavesdropping
on Pam again?

03:44.420 --> 03:46.250
Yes. I'm trying to,
but you keep talking.

03:46.320 --> 03:47.620
She's on the phone.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.770
Oh, baby,
I miss you, too.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.230
If you were here,
you can't believe...

03:52.290 --> 03:53.530
No. No. Okay,
that's just gross.

03:53.590 --> 03:54.730
That's your sister.
Shh.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.260
...things I'd do to you.

03:56.330 --> 03:59.000
I know you only got
10 minutes...

03:59.350 --> 04:01.030
10 minutes?
He's on a time limit?

04:01.100 --> 04:01.850
...let me get
to the dirty parts...

04:01.920 --> 04:03.190
She's talking
to Bo in jail.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.350
Bo is Pam's baby daddy --

04:04.440 --> 04:05.460
currently incarcerated

04:05.520 --> 04:06.690
back in Grasshopper, Missouri,

04:06.720 --> 04:07.790
for punching a police horse.

04:07.860 --> 04:08.810
And now, I'm worried

04:08.880 --> 04:09.930
she's just gonna

04:09.990 --> 04:11.030
throw her future away by

04:11.090 --> 04:12.230
getting back together
with him.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.250
It's crazy how weak she is

04:14.320 --> 04:17.029
with him when she's so strong
in other ways.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.839
I mean, she is
the three-time winner

04:18.899 --> 04:20.470
of the country-fair mule drag.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.870
Step away
from the pipe, Cam.

04:22.940 --> 04:23.740
Come on.
You're better than that.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.380
No, I'm not,
and neither are you.

04:25.440 --> 04:26.680
You eavesdropped
on that couple

04:26.740 --> 04:27.960
behind us
at "Bridget Jones's Baby."

04:28.030 --> 04:29.310
Oh, no, that wasn't
eavesdropping.

04:29.380 --> 04:30.210
We were in public.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.500
And do you think
I really wanted to hear

04:31.570 --> 04:33.570
that moron's recap
of the first movie?

04:33.630 --> 04:35.440
Half those details
were from "Love Actually."

04:35.500 --> 04:37.700
Do you think <i> I'm</i> happy
about <i> this</i> situation?

04:37.760 --> 04:40.040
I wish I couldn't even
hear her at all!

04:40.090 --> 04:42.660
Hey, Boss, are you done
listening to your sister?

04:42.730 --> 04:44.680
The boys are asking
if they can use
the table saw again.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.750
Okay, well,
he's joking.

04:46.810 --> 04:48.370
Before Francisco
was a contractor,

04:48.430 --> 04:50.250
he did stand-up comedy
in Guatemala.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.620
Not just in Guatemala.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.450
Actually, I'm doing 10 minutes
this Friday night at the --

04:53.520 --> 04:54.550
Oh, we have
dinner reservations.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.270
Oh, gay holiday.
Yeah, um...
Yeah.

04:56.340 --> 04:58.990
So, look, but I do want
to talk about the sink
before you leave.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.480
Sorry, Mitch.
That ship has sailed.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.550
Oh, also, did you bring the
new tiles for the backsplash?

05:03.610 --> 05:05.350
Yes, they're in my truck.
I'll be right back, Boss.

05:05.420 --> 05:06.930
Great. Okay. Yeah.
Go get those.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.970
Hey, um, I-I don't want to
make a big deal about this,

05:09.040 --> 05:12.190
but do you notice how he calls
you "Boss" and me "Mitch"?

05:12.260 --> 05:13.610
No, but I did notice...
Yeah.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.780
...how one of his little
pouches on his tool belt

05:15.840 --> 05:17.960
is filled with jelly beans.
How cute is that?

05:18.030 --> 05:20.630
The point is, he treats you
like the actual boss

05:20.710 --> 05:23.250
and me like I'm some,
you know,
ditzy trophy wife.

05:23.320 --> 05:24.600
First of all,
I thought we agreed

05:24.670 --> 05:26.690
we had the rare
dual-trophy-wife situation.

05:26.750 --> 05:28.370
Yeah.
And aside from that,

05:28.440 --> 05:31.520
maybe it's because
I'm a little more,
you know, assertive.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.630
Do you think so? Because
I actually have thought that.

05:33.690 --> 05:35.340
I mean,
maybe I'm too passive,

05:35.410 --> 05:37.830
which could be why
my career has stalled...
No.

05:37.900 --> 05:41.270
...or I agreed to have sex
with all three women
who asked me.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.500
Okay.
Oh, it was so gentle...

05:43.570 --> 05:44.720
Mm-hmm.
...and gross.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.370
You know what?
Well, now's your chance.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.990
You can show Francisco
that you're the big dog.

05:49.060 --> 05:51.340
It's all about
body language, okay?

05:51.410 --> 05:52.280
Show him you can
lead the pack.

05:52.350 --> 05:53.630
Here you go, Boss.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.210
Let me know which one
you like best, all right?

05:55.280 --> 05:58.300
Well, when <i> we</i> decide,
<i>we</i> will let you know.

05:58.370 --> 06:01.200
But first, I wanted
to talk about the, uh --
the dishwasher.

06:01.270 --> 06:03.210
Uh, I wanted it over here
on the left,

06:03.270 --> 06:05.310
but now, for some reason,
it's on the right.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.080
I would like it on the left
like I asked.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.210
Asserted?

06:09.280 --> 06:10.650
Um...
No, no, no, no.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.470
Eyes -- Eyes over here, okay?
This -- This is my thing.

06:12.530 --> 06:14.120
Well, let me
show you something.

06:14.190 --> 06:15.370
Yeah.
All right,
look under the sink.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.250
Will do.

06:16.320 --> 06:18.920
Go down.
All the way.

06:18.990 --> 06:20.710
Okay, now,
get in there.

06:20.770 --> 06:22.910
Look up. Do you see
that post on your left?

06:22.980 --> 06:23.910
Wait. Ho-- Okay.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.260
I can't move that,

06:25.330 --> 06:27.280
which is why the dishwasher
needs to stay where it is.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.700
Anything else?

06:29.770 --> 06:31.500
No, I'm good.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.170
Got some sawdust
on your shirt.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.660
It tickles.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.880
Hey, kid.
Wake up.

06:42.950 --> 06:44.500
We need to talk.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.630
What?

06:45.700 --> 06:48.430
Your mom's car
got a big dent in it.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.390
Now, I know you were
with her.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.410
Did you see
how that happened?

06:52.470 --> 06:55.980
Someone must have hit the car
when we were in the store.

06:56.060 --> 06:57.240
That's what your mom said,

06:57.310 --> 07:00.360
but if it was something else,
like, I don't know,

07:00.430 --> 07:03.350
she got into a little fender
bender, you could tell me.

07:03.420 --> 07:06.690
Someone must have hit the car
when we were in the store.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.800
I know she got to you,
but, uh...

07:08.870 --> 07:11.390
I need you to tell me
the truth.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.860
Is that ice cream
for me?

07:12.930 --> 07:13.990
Could be.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.080
What happened to
your mom's car?

07:16.150 --> 07:18.210
Mmmmm...

07:18.300 --> 07:20.000
I can wait all day,

07:20.050 --> 07:22.750
but the trouble with ice cream
is, it melts.

07:22.820 --> 07:24.300
I like it when it melts.

07:24.370 --> 07:25.310
What do you mean you like it
when it melts?

07:25.370 --> 07:26.970
Nobody likes ice cream
when it melts.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.170
It's like soup.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.260
You hate soup.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.310
Not chocolate soup.

07:30.380 --> 07:31.990
Look, we're getting
off track here.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.880
Tell me what happened
to your mom's car,

07:33.950 --> 07:35.400
and you can have
your ice cream.

07:35.470 --> 07:36.970
Hello, Jay.

07:37.030 --> 07:37.950
Gloria, I...

07:38.100 --> 07:38.950
Look at you,

07:39.020 --> 07:40.970
trying to bribe
a five-year-old.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.520
You should be ashamed.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.570
Let's go, Joe.
Now that you're awake,

07:44.640 --> 07:46.980
Mommy's gonna fix you
a <i> healthy</i> snack.

07:52.850 --> 07:54.180
Check her phone.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.690
Huh?
Check her phone.

07:55.750 --> 07:57.200
And leave the ice cream.

07:57.270 --> 07:59.420
It'll be nice and warm
when I get back.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.300
Oh, Phil, could you change the
lightbulb down in the kitchen?

08:05.360 --> 08:06.610
First you ask me to help clean
the window screens.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.850
Now you want me
to do something
with a ladder and electricity?

08:08.920 --> 08:10.650
Have you forgotten about
my underwear, Claire?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.990
Look, I have friends
whose husbands are mean

08:13.050 --> 08:15.160
or drink too much
or don't come home at all.

08:15.220 --> 08:18.090
And in that moment,
I envied those friends.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.440
Fine. I will change
the lightbulb in the kitchen.

08:20.510 --> 08:24.410
You can put away this nice,
soft, fluffy laundry.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.070
All right.
Don't worry.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.400
There's not even
any zippers or buttons.

08:28.470 --> 08:29.700
Nothing sharp in there.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.190
Wouldn't want you
to lose a finger

08:31.260 --> 08:33.539
in a tragic
folding incident.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.179
Oh, hey.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.980
I was putting away
that harmless laundry

08:40.049 --> 08:41.400
when I stepped
on Luke's skateboard,

08:41.460 --> 08:43.020
rolled out
the screenless window,

08:43.080 --> 08:44.020
and landed in the hedge.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.420
But you're right.

08:45.490 --> 08:47.890
I'm sure it had nothing to do
with the underwear.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.010
It's self-fulfilling.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.070
Phil believes something bad
is gonna happen,

08:51.140 --> 08:53.530
so he makes it happen.

08:53.590 --> 08:55.710
Ow! Paper cut.

08:55.780 --> 08:57.260
Of course, today.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.400
Seriously?

08:58.470 --> 09:00.100
Is this part of
the underwear prophecy?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.930
Aren't you being
a little dramatic?

09:05.420 --> 09:06.960
Phil?

09:07.020 --> 09:08.960
Little bit harder
to connect the dots
on that one.

09:09.030 --> 09:12.250
But coincidences do happen.

09:12.310 --> 09:13.130
Honey, it's fine.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.680
We'll just finish
our errands on a day

09:14.750 --> 09:16.370
when you catch
your underwear.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.630
Oh, do you have
the tickets?

09:17.700 --> 09:19.840
They're in the car,
but I don't think
I should drive.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.820
Fine, but you are
driving home,

09:21.890 --> 09:24.420
because today,
I'm reelin' in the wine.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.590
Oh, you've got the keys.
Can you toss them to me?

09:26.660 --> 09:28.040
Yeah, here. No!

09:32.100 --> 09:34.920
No! Those are our keys! Stop!

09:34.990 --> 09:37.400
Man plans to go to Steely Dan.

09:37.470 --> 09:39.420
God laughs.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.540
Damn it. Haley has
our other set of keys.

09:42.610 --> 09:46.430
Yes, Claire,
I do think it bit me a little!

09:46.500 --> 09:47.650
Gloria, I'm sorry.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.420
You're my wife.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.950
I love you,
and I trust you.

09:50.950 --> 09:52.670
You can't reason
with a sociopath.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.300
You lure them with kindness.

09:54.370 --> 09:57.140
You lull them into thinking
you're on the same side,

09:57.210 --> 10:00.340
and then nail them with
incontrovertible evidence,

10:00.410 --> 10:02.480
which I had.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.510
I also found out
I'm still listed in her phone

10:04.580 --> 10:07.520
as "Jay, Red Tracksuit."

10:07.520 --> 10:10.040
And if you say you weren't in
an accident, I believe you.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.020
Thank you, baby.

10:12.090 --> 10:14.890
There is just...
one more thing.

10:14.890 --> 10:16.660
Is that my phone?

10:16.730 --> 10:18.030
Yeah. You've got a lot of
interesting pictures here,

10:18.090 --> 10:19.730
but especially this one.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.800
It looks like the front end
of your car

10:21.870 --> 10:24.370
is rammed into the back end
of this car.

10:24.430 --> 10:26.350
Now, I'm not
an insurance adjuster,

10:26.420 --> 10:28.720
but I would say
that that's pretty solid proof

10:28.790 --> 10:30.120
you were in an accident.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.670
That's not my car.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.710
But why would you
take a picture
of some random accident?

10:33.780 --> 10:35.960
To remind me
of how precious life is.

10:36.030 --> 10:37.000
That's your license plate.

10:37.060 --> 10:39.580
Do you even know who makes
license plates, Jay?

10:39.650 --> 10:40.670
Prisoners!

10:40.730 --> 10:43.520
Are you gonna take the word
of a convicted felon

10:43.590 --> 10:45.170
over your wife's?

10:45.240 --> 10:46.620
Makes no sense.
Exactly.

10:46.690 --> 10:47.990
What is your problem?!

10:48.180 --> 10:49.680
Don't you see
what this is doing to me?!

10:49.740 --> 10:52.090
I need to know that you can
admit when you made a mistake.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.460
I know there's good
in you, Gloria!

10:54.530 --> 10:56.480
Here you go.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.070
I -- I am so sorry.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.640
Cherish this.

11:02.710 --> 11:05.460
It was the longest I've been
without a phone since phones.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.980
It was hard at first --
the twitching thumbs,

11:08.050 --> 11:11.550
the phantom vibrations,
salads left un-Instagrammed.

11:11.610 --> 11:13.430
But then
the strangest thing happened.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.820
Have you ever stopped
to smell these things?

11:20.980 --> 11:25.080
It's been years
since I LOL'd IRL.

11:25.150 --> 11:27.560
I even found an old book
in the truck
and started reading it.

11:27.630 --> 11:30.280
The only problem was,
people kept interrupting.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.790
I didn't need a phone anymore.

11:35.860 --> 11:37.760
I just needed a quiet place
to find out

11:37.820 --> 11:40.130
how they kill
that mockingbird.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.110
Hey, excuse me.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.780
Excuse me!

11:44.850 --> 11:47.450
S-Sorry to bother you while
you sand, Francisco, um --

11:47.520 --> 11:48.970
Oh, that's cute.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.050
I just want to revisit
the paint color we chose
for the cabinets.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.640
Do you still have
the old sample?

11:52.710 --> 11:54.390
Uh, maybe.
I'll go look.
Okay.

11:54.460 --> 11:56.810
Did you discuss this
with, uh -- with the boss?

11:56.880 --> 11:58.710
I don't have to
discuss it with --
Daddy, where's Daddy?

11:58.780 --> 12:00.210
Oh. Yeah, what do you need?

12:00.280 --> 12:01.630
My suitcase.
Why?

12:01.700 --> 12:03.530
I'm going to Disneyland
with Tricia's family.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.250
Sweetie, I already
packed your suitcase.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.540
Ugh, there's gonna be
too many shoes.

12:07.600 --> 12:09.370
When did we decide that Lily
could go to Disneyland?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.260
I thought we were gonna
talk about this.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.680
She's missing
one day of school.

12:12.740 --> 12:14.190
I missed half
of the fifth grade
because of a pig bite,

12:14.260 --> 12:16.100
and I'm just as educated
as anyone else.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.930
Really? When we met,
you thought you grew up
in Central America.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.430
Missouri is in
the center of America.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.040
Okay. You also thought
that the cavemen killed
all the dinosaurs.

12:24.100 --> 12:26.060
Were you there?
Okay, t-the point is,

12:26.120 --> 12:28.390
we should be making
these decisions together.

12:28.460 --> 12:29.860
Is this the one
you wanted?

12:29.930 --> 12:31.610
Yes.
What's that doing
back in here?

12:31.680 --> 12:34.480
I just wanted to revisit
the original paint color.

12:34.550 --> 12:36.230
Oh, okay.

12:36.300 --> 12:37.730
Asserting.
Good.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.230
Asserting.

12:43.460 --> 12:44.710
Okay.

12:44.770 --> 12:46.860
Can I talk to you
for a second?

12:46.930 --> 12:49.150
Uh, what's up with the
whispering and the laughing?

12:49.210 --> 12:50.260
He just made a joke.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.280
At my expense?

12:51.350 --> 12:53.180
No, it was about
his wife's cooking,

12:53.250 --> 12:55.550
which can't be as stale
as his material.

12:55.940 --> 12:56.570
What's this about?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.190
You undermined me
with Lily,

12:58.310 --> 13:00.760
and now I'm worried that
you're doing the same
thing with Francisco.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.260
Mitchell, we are on
the same team here.

13:03.330 --> 13:04.830
We both want
a beautiful kitchen,

13:04.900 --> 13:08.150
and we both want it done
as soon as possible.
Yes.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.800
Stop working!

13:09.870 --> 13:11.670
Drills down! Drills down!
I want you so bad.

13:11.730 --> 13:14.550
If only I could reach out
and touch you.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.070
Enough
with the eavesdropping.

13:16.140 --> 13:17.460
Come on.
Yeah. You know what?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.130
If that little train wreck's
getting back together with Bo,

13:19.190 --> 13:20.580
I need to deal
with this directly.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.080
No, you have
to stay here -- Ugh.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.880
Pameron Jessica Tucker,
listen to me.

13:25.950 --> 13:28.670
You need to stop those
dirty jailbird phone calls
right this second with Bo,

13:28.740 --> 13:30.120
or I am --
Oh, my God!

13:30.190 --> 13:32.810
You've been listening in
on my private conversation?

13:32.870 --> 13:34.090
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.780
Talking like a girl
from Cricketsville --

13:35.840 --> 13:37.340
you were raised
better than that.

13:37.410 --> 13:39.510
You stay the hell
out of my business.

13:39.580 --> 13:42.300
And stop looking
down your nose
at Cricketsville.

13:42.370 --> 13:45.080
They got a Target now with
a Banksy on the side of it.

13:45.150 --> 13:49.220
Yeah, right. I'm sure Banksy
drove to Cricketsville
and painted on the s--

13:49.290 --> 13:50.740
Oh, you mean the ATM.

13:50.810 --> 13:53.840
Well, what the hell else
would I be talking about?

13:55.350 --> 13:57.410
Hi, my name
is Cameron Tucker,

13:57.480 --> 14:00.330
and I would like to speak
to one of your inmates.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.600
His name is Bo Johnson.

14:03.670 --> 14:05.190
Sally Mae Jenkins?

14:05.260 --> 14:07.940
Oh, of course
I remember you!

14:08.010 --> 14:09.340
Oh, wait, but --

14:09.410 --> 14:11.090
I'm not surprised you're
answering phones at a prison.

14:11.160 --> 14:13.980
You always had the prettiest
voice in Central America.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.950
You called Bo, you ginormous
mountain of stupid?!

14:20.020 --> 14:21.150
Yeah, that's right,
I did.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.740
And I told him
you were getting
your life together here

14:22.810 --> 14:24.740
with your baby
and he needed to back off.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.760
He didn't even know
I had his baby.

14:26.830 --> 14:27.840
What?
Now he knows where I am.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.480
He's gonna come looking for me
when he gets out!

14:30.550 --> 14:33.720
You ruined everything,
you giant, horse-faced dummy.

14:33.780 --> 14:35.400
I'm not sure why every insult
needs a size component.

14:35.470 --> 14:36.500
Look, I'm really sorry.

14:36.570 --> 14:38.870
I had no idea that wasn't Bo
on the phone.

14:38.940 --> 14:42.010
Who else would you be so...
intimate with?

14:42.080 --> 14:44.760
Anybody who can pay
three bucks a minute
for nasty talk.

14:44.830 --> 14:47.850
Okay, you're
a phone-sex operator?

14:47.910 --> 14:50.070
My real-person modeling gigs
haven't been paying the bills.

14:50.130 --> 14:52.900
And I needed a job
where I could stay
at home with the baby.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.320
I didn't even know
that still existed.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.170
Like, I thought
it was all apps
and the Internet now.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.390
Not everyone leads your
coastal-elite lifestyle, Cam.

14:59.460 --> 15:03.060
There's a whole country
full of decent,
hardworking Americans

15:03.130 --> 15:05.650
who still want to torque
their doolies on the phone,

15:05.720 --> 15:07.750
you gargantuan snob!

15:07.820 --> 15:09.130
Just could've said "snob."

15:16.280 --> 15:18.880
Oh, get over yourself.
I'm drawing the tree.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.900
Jay?
I tried to call you.

15:22.970 --> 15:23.930
Where's your phone?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.220
It's in my room.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.850
I'm in a creative space
right now.

15:26.850 --> 15:28.470
She's cute.

15:31.090 --> 15:33.010
I'm going through a little
something with your mom.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.290
I need your take on it.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.500
Hm. I'm excited to see
what boundaries we cross here.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.030
She had a little
fender bender.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.350
I've got her
dead to rights --

15:39.420 --> 15:40.870
And she won't admit it.
Yes.

15:40.930 --> 15:42.250
She never admits
when she's wrong.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.600
Thank you. I was beginning
to think I was the crazy one.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.060
Yeah, she'll
do that to you.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.740
I got IBS when she refused
to admit

15:47.810 --> 15:49.810
that she threw out
my collection of Playbills.

15:49.810 --> 15:52.860
I'm gonna pretend
you said "the flu"
and <i> Playboys</i> and move on.

15:54.180 --> 15:55.950
Eh...

15:56.120 --> 15:58.200
I guess I...
miss you being around

15:58.270 --> 16:01.100
to share that eye roll
when she gets kooky.

16:01.110 --> 16:02.650
I always thought you were
rolling your eyes <i> at</i> me.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.490
Well, that, too.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.190
At least she's
worth it, right?

16:06.260 --> 16:08.840
Definitely.

16:08.910 --> 16:10.950
So, did she ever cop
to the Playbills?

16:11.010 --> 16:12.430
You know what?

16:12.500 --> 16:15.180
Yeah, eventually,
but only because
she did something worse.

16:15.290 --> 16:16.750
Wow.
It's actually a good thing.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.450
As long as she's
denying the accident,

16:18.540 --> 16:20.570
you know that's
the worst thing she's done.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.540
Thanks, kiddo.

16:22.610 --> 16:24.840
Hey, while you're here,
I wouldn't mind
picking your brain

16:24.910 --> 16:26.230
about a little problem
I'm having --

16:26.300 --> 16:27.730
well,
one of my characters.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.380
He finds himself
at a crossroads --

16:29.450 --> 16:31.450
Let's keep this special.

16:34.450 --> 16:36.070
Gloria,
I've been thinking.

16:36.140 --> 16:38.520
That whole accident thing?
I'm dropping it.

16:38.590 --> 16:40.380
You say it didn't happen,
it didn't happen.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.340
It happened.

16:41.410 --> 16:42.300
What, are you
admitting it?

16:42.360 --> 16:45.560
Yes. The accident --
it was my fault.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.380
Please forgive me,
<i>mi amor.</i>

16:47.450 --> 16:49.840
Uh-oh.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.000
Where's Stella?

16:51.070 --> 16:52.840
And, Francisco...
Yeah, Boss?

16:52.910 --> 16:54.490
...I guess we should take
another look

16:54.560 --> 16:56.310
at this cabinet color Mitchell
revived from the dead.

16:56.380 --> 16:59.160
To be fair, let's look at it
in the kitchen light.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.260
So, imagine
I'm entertaining.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.830
I'm cooking. I'm throwing out
delightful quips to my guests.

17:03.900 --> 17:04.930
Be honest --
does it wash me out?

17:05.220 --> 17:05.920
It washes me out.

17:05.990 --> 17:07.349
These are the kind
of conversations

17:07.420 --> 17:09.040
I snuck under
the fence for?

17:09.109 --> 17:10.089
Hm?
Is that funny?

17:10.160 --> 17:11.589
Oh.
It's in my act.

17:11.660 --> 17:12.730
It's...
I also do this bit, though,

17:12.859 --> 17:14.940
where I go to a lumberyard and
I meet this hot girl and --

17:15.010 --> 17:16.280
Okay. I'm gonna stop you
right there.

17:16.349 --> 17:18.450
If the punch line has anything
to do with wood,

17:18.520 --> 17:19.700
you're better than that.

17:19.770 --> 17:22.119
Yes, I chose to be
entombed in a wall

17:22.190 --> 17:25.440
rather than admit to Cam
that I was eavesdropping.

17:25.490 --> 17:26.890
And, yes, I realize
couple's counseling

17:26.960 --> 17:28.190
should be back on the table.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.030
This color
Mitchell wants...

17:30.090 --> 17:31.380
You don't seem
to like it.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.550
I don't love it. But he does,
and let's just go with it,

17:35.620 --> 17:37.470
'cause it --
I want to make him happy.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.370
Wow. My wife
wouldn't even ask me.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.950
You're very nice.
He's lucky to have you.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.720
I'm the lucky one,
trust me.

17:42.790 --> 17:45.260
You know, we start
every morning off
in this kitchen, and I --

17:45.330 --> 17:47.890
I want us both to walk in here
and see something
we each love.

17:47.960 --> 17:51.900
I do!
I-I do see something I love!

17:51.970 --> 17:53.170
And it's you.

17:53.230 --> 17:54.330
Mitchell!
Oh.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.970
What in the he--

17:56.040 --> 17:57.400
You were eavesdropping.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.590
I'm sorry.
I-I stand by what I said.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.310
Eavesdropping is wrong.

18:01.370 --> 18:04.160
I-I should have just asked,
uh, Francisco myself.

18:04.310 --> 18:07.150
W-Why is it you call him
"Boss" and me "Mitch"?

18:07.210 --> 18:08.680
Oh, uh, uh...

18:08.750 --> 18:10.630
It's okay. You can tell me.
I-I can take it.

18:10.700 --> 18:12.750
Well, uh, I can't remember
his name.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.490
What?
Really?

18:14.550 --> 18:16.320
You know, I keep
wanting to say "Krang,"

18:16.390 --> 18:17.790
but I know that
that's not right.

18:17.860 --> 18:18.770
Unless it is?

18:18.840 --> 18:20.340
It's Cam.
It's Cam.

18:20.410 --> 18:23.430
Okay. We have spent every day
together, Francisco.

18:23.500 --> 18:24.650
I'm a little offended.

18:24.710 --> 18:26.550
Oh. Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

18:26.800 --> 18:28.700
my name's
actually Fernando.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.220
Oh.
It does help.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.590
Ah! There she is.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.440
Haley!

18:34.510 --> 18:36.110
Haley!

18:36.180 --> 18:37.960
Haley!
Oh, my God!

18:38.030 --> 18:39.430
What is going on?!

18:39.500 --> 18:41.780
Damn it!
We need those keys!

18:41.850 --> 18:43.280
Got to get to the concert
before the roadies

18:43.350 --> 18:45.600
pick all the hot chicks
that get to party backstage.

18:45.670 --> 18:47.120
I'm confused.

18:47.190 --> 18:50.190
Even back in the day,
they weren't exactly --
Haley!

18:50.260 --> 18:52.620
You know what?
I'll go get them.

18:52.690 --> 18:53.810
No. No. You can't.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.960
Um, not today.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.460
You believe in the curse,
don't you?

18:57.530 --> 18:58.900
I don't understand it.

18:58.970 --> 19:00.880
Bad things have been happening
to you all day.

19:00.970 --> 19:01.950
Maybe...

19:02.020 --> 19:03.050
Maybe it's the underwear.

19:03.120 --> 19:04.900
I just --
I can't take a chance.

19:05.090 --> 19:06.720
You stay here.
No, no, no, no, no.

19:06.790 --> 19:08.920
You getting hurt
is the worst possible thing

19:08.990 --> 19:10.780
that could happen
to me.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.630
Tell the kids
I love them.

19:12.700 --> 19:13.550
Oh, honey.

19:13.610 --> 19:15.180
Are you, uh --
Are you not wearing a bra?

19:15.250 --> 19:16.570
Eh.
Oh.

19:16.630 --> 19:17.980
All right, be safe.

19:22.570 --> 19:24.570
Oh, my God.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.060
That's Dunphy.

19:26.130 --> 19:27.990
50 bucks to the first guy
who hits him, huh?

19:28.060 --> 19:29.140
Go.

19:31.000 --> 19:31.910
Haley!

19:33.120 --> 19:35.430
Oh, Dad?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.090
Okay, listen.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.150
I lost my car keys.
I need the spare set.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.410
I know that makes me
a hypocrite.

19:41.470 --> 19:43.610
But you have every right
to be angry with me.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.210
How could I be angry
when there's so much

19:45.210 --> 19:47.100
to be grateful for?

19:47.160 --> 19:48.830
Is that a -- a book?

19:48.900 --> 19:52.020
I never would have
picked it up if you had
bought me a new phone.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.490
You've gotten a little gray.
I like it.

19:57.860 --> 19:59.560
Honey...the keys?

19:59.630 --> 20:02.060
Sorry. I was distracted
by those bumblebees.

20:02.130 --> 20:05.350
Shh, listen -- They're
talking to each other.

20:09.890 --> 20:10.920
Hm.

20:13.070 --> 20:13.960
Huh.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.380
Ow!
Yeah!

20:18.950 --> 20:20.360
Is that freakin' Gil?

20:20.430 --> 20:23.070
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

20:23.130 --> 20:25.700
Well, that could happen
any day.

20:28.540 --> 20:30.470
He's still moving!
Machine-gun him!

20:30.540 --> 20:31.670
Just hit as fast
as you can!

20:31.740 --> 20:35.080
Dear God!
He's got me dialed in!

20:38.400 --> 20:41.500
Oh, morning, guys.
You missed
a beautiful sunrise.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.970
You know,
living without a phone
these past few days

20:44.040 --> 20:45.720
has been such a gift.

20:45.790 --> 20:48.960
Colors are brighter.
Tastes are tastier.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.540
Have you ever eaten a peach?

20:50.610 --> 20:52.860
I mean,<i> really</i> eaten a peach?

20:52.930 --> 20:55.210
Well, most of this
is in my short story.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.570
The best part, though,
has been

20:56.630 --> 20:58.000
really getting
to know you two.

20:58.070 --> 21:00.150
Dad, you are so funny.

21:00.220 --> 21:02.020
And you have such kind eyes.

21:02.090 --> 21:03.110
And, Mom --

21:03.170 --> 21:05.020
president of a closet company?

21:05.090 --> 21:07.760
Way to go!

21:07.830 --> 21:10.030
I guess that's why it makes it
so hard to say goodbye.

21:11.850 --> 21:14.100
Came in this morning.
Luke set it up for me.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.120
He really shot up, huh?

21:16.190 --> 21:18.750
Anyway, in the weeks to come,

21:18.820 --> 21:20.940
try and remember that, uh...

21:21.010 --> 21:24.160
Wh-- That skank -- No way!
