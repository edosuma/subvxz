WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:05.923
- All I was doing was getting it back.
- By breaking into school.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.843
- [Alex] He wants me to be just like him.
- What's wrong with that?

00:08.926 --> 00:10.010
[police officer]
It was a head-on collision.

00:10.094 --> 00:12.304
Your uncle was over the speed limit.

00:12.388 --> 00:15.516
No hospital in London has any record
of him being brought in.

00:15.599 --> 00:16.851
I dunno, maybe they
spelled his name wrong.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.060
Maybe it didn't happen.

00:18.144 --> 00:19.437
- [man] Ian.
- Yassen.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.980
I'm sorry, Ian.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.314
Who are you?

00:22.398 --> 00:26.110
A specialized subdivision of
the British Secret Intelligence Service.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.653
There's something we'd like you
to do for us.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.363
You want me to help you?

00:29.447 --> 00:32.491
The only people that can get in to
Point Blanc are troubled teenagers.

00:32.575 --> 00:35.536
Been two very high-profile
accidental deaths recently.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.747
Michael Roscoe
and Parker Roscoe's father.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.666
Gregoriy Serenkov.
Your uncle was getting close with him.

00:40.750 --> 00:42.835
Two deaths, two teenagers, one school.

00:42.918 --> 00:46.422
You take a look around, you report back
anything you think could be relevant.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.384
[Smithers] You will be Alex Friend,
son of the billionaire Sir David Friend.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.845
[Eva] This is Alex.
Please welcome him to Point Blanc.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.263
- [students] Hi.
- Kyra.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.515
- Say hello to Alex.
- Hello to Alex.

00:56.599 --> 00:58.350
- Where are the others?
- Oh, there are no others.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.435
We may have a problem.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.312
- Sorry.
- Tom Harris, right?

01:01.395 --> 01:02.813
- Can I help you?
- Another time.

01:02.897 --> 01:05.316
They have these, like, copies of us.
It's like looking in the mirror.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.567
They're supposed to be us.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.694
[Smithers]
Alex has been compromised.

01:08.778 --> 01:10.488
Alex Rider, I presume.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.574
[Mrs. Jones] All hostages
and clones are accounted for.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.326
- [Kyra] Can you even snowboard?
- I can snowboard.

01:16.327 --> 01:19.121
We've got movement. They've got
snowmobiles out across the mountain.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.498
How soon can you be in the air?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.124
[Crawley] You can't authorize
a military operation.

01:22.208 --> 01:24.251
[Mrs. Jones] If I'm wrong,
then Blunt can fire me.

01:25.878 --> 01:27.880
- You're not an agent.
- Then why am I here?

01:27.963 --> 01:30.591
If I'm not an agent, you're not my boss.
I'm going.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.221
[Alex grunting]

01:35.304 --> 01:37.264
[grunting and yelling]

01:37.848 --> 01:38.974
[Alex] Tom?

01:44.730 --> 01:47.608
How about we let him walk away
and live a normal life.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.035
[Alex] It was supposed to be over.

02:46.292 --> 02:47.710
That's what they said.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.465
The weird stuff.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.261
I dealt with it.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.348
I did what I was supposed to do.

03:02.391 --> 03:04.435
So now everything could just...

03:05.769 --> 03:07.313
go back to normal.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.775
It was supposed to be over.

03:15.487 --> 03:16.488
[Lambert] And is it?

03:20.409 --> 03:23.245
You mentioned before
about the nightmares you've been having.

03:23.329 --> 03:24.580
It's more than that.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.541
Now it's happening in the day as well.

03:27.625 --> 03:31.629
And what about the breathing exercises
that we practiced, are those helping?

03:33.631 --> 03:35.507
Yeah, I suppose. Sometimes.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.304
Let's go back to the beginning.

03:42.181 --> 03:47.061
When was the first time
you saw this man with the scar?

03:50.898 --> 03:54.735
I first saw him
at the school I told you about.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.079
And now he's on the tube.

04:07.539 --> 04:09.917
He's in the supermarket.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.256
He was... He was outside my house.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.510
Like he-- He's following me.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.429
But not really.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.475
No. Not really.

04:28.519 --> 04:32.231
But this man with the scar,
did he hurt you?

04:35.401 --> 04:36.276
No.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.153
Did he threaten you?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.446
Um...

04:39.530 --> 04:41.031
Were you afraid of him?

04:43.075 --> 04:45.786
No. But, um...

04:49.164 --> 04:52.084
The way he looked at me, it was like--

04:52.167 --> 04:53.085
Like, weird.

04:54.003 --> 04:58.757
We don't get post-traumatic stress
from someone looking at us weirdly.

04:58.841 --> 04:59.717
[sighs]

05:00.718 --> 05:03.470
Do you think there might be
some other reason

05:03.554 --> 05:05.347
that this man is important to you?

05:08.434 --> 05:09.643
All I know is...

05:11.520 --> 05:12.646
I don't see Greif.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.858
I don't see Stellenbosch.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.238
I see the man with the scar.

05:52.728 --> 05:53.979
[cell phone buzzing]

05:58.275 --> 05:59.651
- Hey.
- [Jack] Hey.

05:59.735 --> 06:01.987
Just checking in. How was Dr. Lambert?

06:02.071 --> 06:03.947
Yeah. It was fine.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.325
You don't sound fine.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.327
No, I sound insane.

06:09.411 --> 06:13.540
Saying this stuff out loud, I can see her,
she's looking at me and she's like:

06:13.624 --> 06:16.168
"He's lost it. He's making this up."

06:16.251 --> 06:18.712
She doesn't think that. None of us do.

06:18.796 --> 06:20.255
Yeah, well, maybe I do.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.633
Alex, you need to give yourself a break.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.220
Okay? I mean it. Stop beating yourself up.

06:26.303 --> 06:30.349
Yeah, uh, look, I'm back at school.
Can we talk later?

06:30.432 --> 06:31.433
Sure.

06:39.108 --> 06:40.109
[knocking]

06:40.943 --> 06:43.445
- [Matovu] Jack! Good to see you.
- Mm-hm.

06:43.529 --> 06:44.988
How are you doing?

06:45.072 --> 06:48.700
- You're finding your feet?
- Yeah. I'm really enjoying it here.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.577
Uh, thanks again for taking me on.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.204
We love our interns.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.706
And everyone speaks very highly of you.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.999
What are you working on?

06:56.083 --> 06:59.169
Home Office rulings
on indefinite right to remain cases.

07:00.295 --> 07:01.880
And how are you finding that?

07:01.964 --> 07:05.509
- It feels important.
- Glad to hear you say that.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.177
That's what we do here.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.307
Anything I can do to help?

07:12.891 --> 07:15.561
[Steph] My ears have not yet
drunk a hundred words

07:15.644 --> 07:18.021
of that tongue's utterance,
yet I know the sound.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.607
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.527
[boy] Neither, dear saint,
if either thee dislike.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.530
How camest thou hither,
tell me, and wherefore?

07:26.613 --> 07:28.532
[Boswell] Right. Hold it there.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.327
- Ah. Mercutio. Good to see you.
- [Alex] Sorry.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.745
[Boswell] How's the tooth?

07:34.288 --> 07:38.167
Oh, yeah, um, it--
It needs a bit of work still, sir.

07:38.250 --> 07:39.877
You realize in Shakespeare's time,

07:39.960 --> 07:41.670
they'd have just yanked it out
with a pair of pliers.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.672
No anesthetic or anything.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.341
Yeah, I think I'll stick to my dentist
if that's all right, sir.

07:46.425 --> 07:49.094
[Boswell] Take a seat
and we'll get on with the scene.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.598
- That was very good, Steph.
- [groans]

07:52.681 --> 07:55.058
[Boswell] Look, it's clear you
both understand the language...

07:55.142 --> 07:56.018
You okay?

07:56.101 --> 07:59.021
...let's not forget there's a gang war
bubbling beneath the surface here...

07:59.104 --> 08:00.814
Honestly, not sure anymore.

08:02.691 --> 08:06.111
The more I talk to her, the more I think
maybe I'm properly broken.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.739
You're not broken.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.035
- Dented a bit, maybe.
- [chuckles]

08:13.118 --> 08:15.287
- Oh, come here, you.
- Don't you dare hug me.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.207
- [Boswell] Quiet back there!
- Sorry. Sorry, sir.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.627
[Steph] If they do see thee,
they will murder thee...

08:21.710 --> 08:22.794
[Sam] Alack...

08:24.254 --> 08:26.340
It's a shame you were late
to rehearsals, mate.

08:26.423 --> 08:27.591
Steph's brilliant.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.968
- Yeah?
- She's great.

08:31.803 --> 08:33.513
Why didn't you try out
for Romeo, again?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.557
[Tom] Not my bag. Too many lines.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
Yeah, but now Sam gets to snog her
in front of the whole school.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.856
- "Give me my sin again."
- You're so mature, mate.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.028
- Whoa, what's this?
- New toy.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.490
I can do tracking shots now.
Well, biking shots.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.327
Listen, uh, I was thinking
coursework at yours later

08:55.410 --> 08:58.163
'cause, truth be told, I wasn't
really paying attention in history.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.165
You were supposed to be
taking notes for me.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.627
That's a fair point. All right, later.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.057
Is everything all right, Alex?

09:18.767 --> 09:19.768
Yeah.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.243
Oh, hey!

11:00.327 --> 11:02.704
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, you...?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.582
- You all right, son?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:05.665 --> 11:09.127
- You sure?
- Yeah, sorry. It's...

11:09.711 --> 11:10.545
Sorry, it--

11:11.088 --> 11:14.341
- Um, I have to-- I have to go.
- It's all right, yeah.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.386
Yeah, sorry about that.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.524
- [Jack] So it happened again.
- It didn't just happen again.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.443
This time I nearly hurt someone.

11:34.319 --> 11:37.823
I mean, I was going to.
I was sure it was him.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.537
There's something wrong with me.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.874
Mate, there's nothing wrong with you.
You know, you're just...

11:48.625 --> 11:50.293
- You're just tired.
- [Tom] Yeah.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.963
You need a vacation. We all do.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.673
And what is it next week?

11:54.756 --> 11:56.258
Half-term.

11:56.341 --> 12:00.011
- Tom, do you have anything planned?
- Actually, my diary is...

12:00.720 --> 12:01.888
pretty much empty.

12:02.556 --> 12:04.141
You mean you're not spending
the whole week

12:04.224 --> 12:06.351
gazing lovingly into Steph's eyes?

12:06.435 --> 12:08.145
Please try and grow up.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.689
We're actually very independent people.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.650
Anyway, she's visiting
an aunt, apparently.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.735
So here's what I was thinking.

12:15.819 --> 12:19.698
Beaches. Big waves. Sunshine. Surfing.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.908
- South of France?
- No, no, no, Miami.

12:21.992 --> 12:22.909
You up for it?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.703
- Yeah, go on then.
- Sure.

12:24.786 --> 12:28.165
Good. 'Cause I already made the booking.

12:28.874 --> 12:29.875
Cornwall?

12:30.959 --> 12:33.253
- Cornwall?
- What's wrong with Cornwall?

12:33.336 --> 12:35.005
Well, for a start, it's in England.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.174
- It has everything.
- Yeah, including rain.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.884
Wear layers.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.094
They have scones and clotted cream,

12:41.178 --> 12:42.971
which I hear are very famous.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.932
Yeah, you know what,
I-I'm gonna have to ask my parents.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.809
[light giggle]
I already did.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.019
Alex?

12:51.271 --> 12:54.316
Yeah. Okay. Actually sounds all right.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.027
I'll get the tents down from the attic.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.278
Tents?

13:49.412 --> 13:50.413
Whoo!

14:04.052 --> 14:05.053
- [avatar grunting]
- [video game chiming]

14:05.136 --> 14:08.473
What's all this?
I thought you were gonna start.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.768
- Like, you know, the tent?
- Yeah. Just a sec. Just a sec.

14:13.645 --> 14:14.646
I've got this.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.189
I've got this, I've got this--

14:17.023 --> 14:18.024
Damn it!

14:18.900 --> 14:20.694
- You haven't got this?
- No, it's this guy.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.780
This K7 guy just totally slaughtered me.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.449
- Who's K7?
- He's top of the leaderboard.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.577
And a dick, I'm willing to bet.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.120
[Tom] So, what's next?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.914
- [Alex] Let me just bash this in.
- [hammering]

14:32.998 --> 14:33.832
Done.

14:36.001 --> 14:39.004
Ah. Not bad, if I do say so myself.

14:39.588 --> 14:40.422
Yeah.

14:41.006 --> 14:42.757
You could be head
of the Boy Scout leaderboard.

14:42.841 --> 14:43.925
[chuckles]

14:44.551 --> 14:47.846
Basically everyone is obsessed
with Feathered Serpent apart from you.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.307
Even Steph's quite good. She got me on it.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.518
I mean, you'll like the guy that made it,
Damian Cray. He's super cool.

14:53.602 --> 14:58.857
He's like an ultra-geeky gamer boy
mixed with a billionaire tech guru.

14:58.940 --> 15:02.152
And he's built in these sick
little Easter eggs into the game.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.737
D'you think he plays his own game?

15:03.820 --> 15:05.530
Oh, definitely. He's that kind of guy.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.198
Then maybe he's K7.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.708
What's this?

15:18.001 --> 15:20.879
Did you seriously think
you were gonna get the big tent?

15:22.797 --> 15:25.008
There's two of us.
There's only one of you.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.844
But I'm older and more important.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.847
Well, it's not our fault you
suddenly got a career, Ms. Lawyer.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.266
- Camping builds character.
- [Tom chuckles]

15:33.350 --> 15:36.478
You can have midnight feasts
and tell ghost stories.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.854
You're so not cool.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.608
Right, okay. This time for the win.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.943
Make them feel the respect.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.362
- Oh, I will.
- Mm.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.221
[door opens, then closes]

18:04.250 --> 18:05.335
Oh! No!

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
- Sorry, sorry.
- For God's sake!

18:07.504 --> 18:09.339
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.423
Sorry.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.674
You gotta watch where you're going!

18:12.801 --> 18:14.302
Running around like a lunatic!

18:14.385 --> 18:15.929
I'm really sorry.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.764
- I-it's okay.
- No, it is not okay.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.974
Do you know how many months' work
this represents?

18:20.058 --> 18:21.976
- Dad, it's all here. Take it easy.
- Oh, no!

18:22.060 --> 18:24.479
- Look!
- I'll get them.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.391
- I think that's all of them.
- Yeah.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.726
Right. Uh, thanks.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.271
Um...

19:06.855 --> 19:09.774
Sorry about that.
And not bad on the skills.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.276
Cheers. Uh, look...

19:12.652 --> 19:16.698
I was just trying to catch someone.
It was a guy in a dark coat.

19:16.781 --> 19:19.868
- Did you see him?
- Uh, no. I didn't see anyone.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.495
See you around... maybe.

19:23.872 --> 19:24.873
[Alex] Sure.

19:58.948 --> 19:59.991
[avatar grunts]

20:01.284 --> 20:02.327
What took you so long?

20:03.286 --> 20:04.370
Surf shop's open.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.456
Come on,
we're gonna rent you a board.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.709
Or we could stay here
and kill Aztec demon-gods.

20:10.919 --> 20:14.297
Except that would be
kind of unbearably tragic?

20:14.380 --> 20:17.133
- [avatars grunting]
- [video game chiming]

20:19.969 --> 20:21.387
Are you serious about this?

20:22.263 --> 20:24.807
It'll be fun. Promise.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.602
Knew I should've stayed in London.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.900
playing over speakers]

20:35.902 --> 20:37.278
What's all this? You...

20:37.362 --> 20:39.489
Oh, you're going with
the temple of dead gods, yeah?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.406
Yeah.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.200
Not going too well.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.745
I keep getting to the first chamber,
and then this monster lizard thing comes,

20:45.828 --> 20:47.163
and we wipe-- Ugh!

20:47.246 --> 20:48.331
Yeah, it's tricky.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.835
What you want to do is,
you want to get your tank to kite it down

20:52.919 --> 20:56.005
deeper into the pyramid,
that way it can't turn and maneuver.

20:56.089 --> 20:59.092
Then you wanna get your DPS
to just hit it in the ass.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.969
I mean, your tank dies,

21:01.052 --> 21:03.846
but so does lizard guy,
and then you're through.

21:04.889 --> 21:07.058
- Cheers.
- Yeah, no worries.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.730
All right, well, what do I need? What's--?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.774
Uh, well, I've just got you--

21:14.857 --> 21:16.317
Whoo!

21:16.401 --> 21:18.695
You feeling that, lizard guy?
You feeling that?

21:18.778 --> 21:21.406
Totally dead! Yes!

21:21.489 --> 21:22.615
Get in!

21:23.282 --> 21:25.159
Awesome, mate. Cheers!

21:25.243 --> 21:26.536
Nah, you're welcome.

21:27.328 --> 21:28.579
My work here is done.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.248
I see that.

21:30.331 --> 21:31.624
Um...

21:31.708 --> 21:35.712
Come on. Let's choose your board.
Time to be a real hero.

21:44.262 --> 21:46.097
Looks kinda cold, man.

21:48.683 --> 21:49.726
Surf's good.

21:49.809 --> 21:50.893
Yeah. In a...

21:51.519 --> 21:53.938
violent, life-threatening way, I guess.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.773
Other people are doing it.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.367
- Hello again.
- [Tom] Again?

22:06.451 --> 22:08.578
[Alex] Hey. Is your dad okay?

22:08.661 --> 22:10.163
As okay as he gets.

22:10.747 --> 22:14.083
- I'm sorry. He can be a bit...
- Oh, yeah, I noticed.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.835
I'm Sabina, by the way.

22:15.918 --> 22:16.919
I'm Alex.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.256
Well, I'm Tom. Hi.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.758
Are you camping?

22:21.841 --> 22:24.135
In a very, very small tent.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.305
- How about you?
- Oh, we're, uh, renting a house,

22:27.388 --> 22:28.473
the modern one.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.767
Ah. Nice.

22:30.850 --> 22:32.643
So you're at the campsite,

22:32.727 --> 22:35.813
and you're not sitting in the rec room
playing Feathered Serpent.

22:35.897 --> 22:39.609
No. No, we thought that'd be, uh,
pretty unbearably tragic.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.402
[Sabina]
Well, no one else seems to think so.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.905
You guys are the first people
I've seen outside in, like, a week.

22:43.988 --> 22:47.366
I know. I've been trying to get
Tom to come and try the surf, but...

22:47.450 --> 22:49.494
It's pretty cold out there. Just saying.

22:49.577 --> 22:50.870
Yeah, see?

22:52.121 --> 22:57.001
Well, if you ever need, like,
Wi-Fi or microwave pizza or whatever...

22:57.085 --> 22:57.919
Yeah.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.505
Yeah. Yeah, that would be...

23:00.588 --> 23:02.965
- You know where I am.
- Yeah, cool.

23:03.966 --> 23:04.967
Good plan.

23:09.555 --> 23:10.556
What?

23:11.140 --> 23:13.017
Met a girl, huh?

23:13.643 --> 23:14.769
So?

23:14.852 --> 23:16.062
You didn't tell me.

23:16.771 --> 23:17.814
Shut up.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.150
[Sabina] Hey!

23:22.485 --> 23:24.487
Did you find the guy you were looking for?

23:28.950 --> 23:31.452
Uh, no, actually.
It was-- It was a mistake.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.340
Coming?

23:47.635 --> 23:51.347
[Tom yelping] Ooh, that's cold!

23:52.014 --> 23:53.975
Speaking as someone
in a committed relationship...

23:54.058 --> 23:55.852
- [Alex laughs]
- Oh, dear.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.645
No, honestly, he's doing it again.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.856
- Doing what?
- You know, the thing you do.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.900
Where you fall for people
who are way out of your league.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.194
I'm not falling for her. I just met her.

24:05.278 --> 24:08.406
Mm-hm. One look across a crowded beach...

24:08.489 --> 24:09.949
It wasn't crowded.

24:10.658 --> 24:13.411
Look, I surf, she surfs. That's all.

24:14.078 --> 24:17.582
What you need, mate, is someone
with manageable expectations

24:17.665 --> 24:19.584
who could look at you and think:

24:19.667 --> 24:22.879
"You know what?
In a pinch, I could settle for that."

24:25.006 --> 24:26.924
Did you get my coffee for the morning?

24:27.550 --> 24:28.926
You didn't say to buy coffee.

24:29.010 --> 24:31.512
- It's coffee. I shouldn't have to say.
- Ooh.

24:32.305 --> 24:33.306
Well, you know what?

24:34.015 --> 24:37.560
I think Alex's friend Sabina
might have some coffee.

24:38.769 --> 24:39.979
It's just a thought.

25:05.588 --> 25:06.714
[doorbell rings]

25:10.760 --> 25:12.553
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:12.637 --> 25:13.554
Uh...

25:13.638 --> 25:15.514
Can I borrow some coffee?

25:23.314 --> 25:25.191
- Dad?
- [father] Yeah?

25:25.691 --> 25:27.902
Alex has come over for some coffee.

25:28.819 --> 25:31.739
You remember him, right?

25:32.740 --> 25:33.574
I do?

25:34.492 --> 25:37.620
Runs like a lunatic,
doesn't see where he's going?

25:38.788 --> 25:41.791
- Oh, right. Yeah. Hi, Alex.
- Hey.

25:44.335 --> 25:45.586
This is impossible.

25:46.170 --> 25:49.131
Need my cloud files.
I just need to back all this stuff up.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.384
Dad, he's here. He's fixing it.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.261
We've got problems with our Internet.

25:53.344 --> 25:55.805
[father] Why would it choose today
to stop working?

25:55.888 --> 25:58.099
[Sabina] Dad, it didn't choose.

25:58.182 --> 26:00.059
[father] Yeah. I know, it's, uh...

26:00.142 --> 26:03.145
Look, uh,
I've really gotta get on with this.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.439
There's coffee up in the cupboard.

26:08.609 --> 26:09.694
This way.

26:16.075 --> 26:18.286
You have to excuse my dad.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.454
He doesn't get out much, obviously.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.208
- He a writer?
- A journalist.

26:24.292 --> 26:25.835
But, yeah, this is a book.

26:26.377 --> 26:28.671
It's gonna be huge, apparently.

26:29.213 --> 26:30.506
I hope so.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.426
I think he blew his advance
renting this place.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.510
Yeah.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.392
- Well, here you go.
- Thank you.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.274
Um, do you wanna hang out? Like, now?

26:50.026 --> 26:52.987
- Sure. Okay.
- We could go to the beach.

26:53.529 --> 26:54.739
Skim some stones?

27:03.331 --> 27:04.707
Is he always like that?

27:05.916 --> 27:09.170
Uh, only when he's writing,
which is most of the time.

27:09.253 --> 27:10.296
[soft chuckle]

27:10.379 --> 27:13.883
And when he isn't writing,
he just sort of freaks out.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.471
Sounds interesting.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.433
Yeah, well, interesting is why Mum left.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.810
[father] Hey, uh...

27:25.686 --> 27:26.562
Hey.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.107
So how much longer is it gonna take?

27:31.859 --> 27:33.694
It will be very soon.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.283
Okay.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.959
So, uh, what's his book about?

27:49.043 --> 27:50.169
Damian Cray.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.589
The Feathered Serpent guy?
The, uh, billionaire?

27:53.672 --> 27:54.673
That's the one.

27:56.675 --> 27:57.843
Is it like a biography?

27:58.594 --> 27:59.845
I suppose so.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.430
He never talks to me about it.

28:01.514 --> 28:04.100
He says he doesn't want me
to get involved.

28:20.574 --> 28:21.659
Alex?

28:24.662 --> 28:26.080
Alex, what is it?

28:27.623 --> 28:29.750
Yeah, nothing. Um, it's fine.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.919
You sure? You've gone pale.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.132
Yeah. I'm good.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.217
[chuckles]

28:52.398 --> 28:54.066
I know what you're thinking.

28:54.567 --> 28:58.362
But I'm not gonna swap my small green tent

28:58.446 --> 29:00.698
for your big house and swimming pool.

29:01.282 --> 29:05.703
- Because camping builds character.
- Mm. I bet.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.583
To be honest,
I just wish I was home, with my friends.

29:12.126 --> 29:13.294
Where's home?

29:13.377 --> 29:15.463
Most of the time, London, with Mum.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.090
Holidays and weekends with Dad.

29:18.174 --> 29:20.009
You know. Complicated.

29:20.551 --> 29:23.304
Yeah. I know complicated.

29:24.388 --> 29:25.264
Yeah?

29:26.432 --> 29:28.225
Ah, it's kind of a long story.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.064
Dad!

29:39.528 --> 29:40.946
[girl] What is it?

29:45.117 --> 29:46.118
Alex.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.204
Come on!

30:05.012 --> 30:07.014
[alarms beeping]

30:09.350 --> 30:11.268
Scarf!
Give me your scarf.

30:13.854 --> 30:14.855
Dad!

30:15.981 --> 30:16.982
Dad!

30:18.150 --> 30:19.276
Dad!

30:21.779 --> 30:22.780
Dad!

30:24.949 --> 30:25.950
[keypad beeping]

30:42.424 --> 30:44.051
[gasps]

30:46.512 --> 30:49.974
[panting]

30:53.227 --> 30:55.020
Dad! Alex!

30:55.104 --> 30:57.523
[dispatcher]
999, which service do you require?

30:57.606 --> 31:00.025
Fire Service and an ambulance!

31:00.109 --> 31:02.027
Dad! Dad!

31:03.112 --> 31:04.530
[Alex grunts]

31:17.167 --> 31:19.169
[indistinct radio chatter]

31:29.888 --> 31:32.766
[indistinct chatter]

31:41.609 --> 31:42.943
[Jack] The man with the scar?

31:44.361 --> 31:48.115
I know how it sounds. And I know
I've said it before, and it wasn't real.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.784
But this time, I saw him.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.871
- I saw him.
- [Jack] Okay, okay.

31:53.954 --> 31:54.788
Alex?

31:56.373 --> 31:58.208
We just want to go over what happened.

31:58.292 --> 31:59.627
Yeah.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.966
Okay, Alex, why don't you
start at the beginning?

32:06.050 --> 32:07.801
There was a van outside.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.179
You need to find the van,
you need to find the driver.

32:10.262 --> 32:13.265
- All right. Why is that?
- It's a-- it's a gray Transit van.

32:13.349 --> 32:16.143
It has "Rob's Internet Services"
on the side.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.812
The guy's white, maybe mid-30's.

32:18.896 --> 32:23.108
He-- he wears dark clothes,
and-and he has a scar down his face.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.193
He's dangerous.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.446
You need to tell your officers
to stay back and to call for support.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.408
So the Internet bloke is dangerous?

32:31.492 --> 32:32.826
He's not an Internet bloke.

32:32.910 --> 32:35.162
He's-- He's the guy that planted the bomb.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.582
What? There wasn't any bomb, Alex.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.211
So, what do you think did this?

32:42.294 --> 32:45.381
We just spoke to the fire department.
It was a gas leak in the kitchen.

32:45.464 --> 32:48.342
No, no. It might look like a gas leak,
but it-it wasn't.

32:48.425 --> 32:51.261
No, no. It was still burning
when we got here.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.223
Fire department had to shut it off
at the mains. Not a bomb.

32:54.306 --> 32:58.268
[Alex] Okay, look, Rob's Internet Services
has a 24-hour line.

32:58.352 --> 33:00.938
While we were waiting for you guys
to turn up, I called it.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.817
They have no record of any engineer
being sent to this address.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.068
So what?

33:06.652 --> 33:09.780
So it was a cover. He wasn't real.

33:09.863 --> 33:13.367
Maybe someone's moonlighting, you know?
Jobs on the side for cash.

33:13.450 --> 33:16.829
It wasn't someone.
His name is Yassen Gregorovitch.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.163
You need to find him.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.916
As long as he's around,
none of us are safe.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.461
Look, Alex,
you're not in any trouble here.

33:24.545 --> 33:28.298
I'm telling you, it wasn't an accident!
It was deliberate. He tried to kill him.

33:28.382 --> 33:30.592
Why would he would wanna kill anyone?

33:34.012 --> 33:35.723
We talked to Sabina.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.392
She said just before
the explosion, you stopped,

33:38.475 --> 33:40.269
like maybe something was bothering you.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.064
Yeah.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.316
Um...

33:46.400 --> 33:47.484
I-- So?

33:47.568 --> 33:50.237
Maybe you wanted
to go back to the house.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.408
- I-- I was worried.
- Why?

33:54.491 --> 33:56.034
- [Jack] Alex...
- I-- I--

33:56.952 --> 33:58.787
I thought something-something was wrong.

33:58.871 --> 34:02.708
[female officer] Alex, did you
touch anything in the kitchen?

34:03.292 --> 34:06.378
On the cooker? By accident, maybe?

34:06.462 --> 34:08.297
I hope you're going somewhere with this.

34:08.380 --> 34:09.465
- You're wasting time.
- No.

34:09.548 --> 34:11.759
We're just trying
to understand what happened.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.094
Look, you said
you knew something was wrong.

34:14.178 --> 34:15.554
Do you mean you had a feeling?

34:15.637 --> 34:18.307
Or... do you mean you actually knew?

34:18.390 --> 34:20.934
- You're kidding. You think I did this?
- [Jack] Okay, that's enough.

34:21.018 --> 34:23.187
You either put him under caution
or you leave him alone.

34:23.270 --> 34:26.231
- [female officer] Sorry, you are...?
- His lawyer, if he needs one.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.193
Look, Alex, tell us the truth, okay?

34:29.276 --> 34:32.613
No more stories about bombs
or men with scars.

34:32.696 --> 34:33.989
Just the truth.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.492
Okay. You want the truth.

34:37.868 --> 34:39.244
Yeah, here's the truth.

34:40.454 --> 34:41.288
Call this number.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.332
- What are you doing?
- It's fine. Let them call.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.083
- [Jack] Is this clever?
- [Alex] He was here.

34:45.167 --> 34:48.796
Who is this? Like...
your personal banker?

34:48.879 --> 34:50.130
Just call her.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.257
Give her your badge number,

34:52.341 --> 34:56.595
tell her what happened,
tell her Alex Rider told you to call her.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.263
- Alex...
- [Alex] Just--

34:58.347 --> 35:00.891
Please. You don't know
what you're dealing with.

35:01.642 --> 35:02.726
Just call her.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.652
[cell phone keypad beeping]

35:21.912 --> 35:24.998
[automated voice] The number
you have dialed has not been recognized.

35:25.082 --> 35:26.041
Uh...

35:26.124 --> 35:28.877
The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

35:30.254 --> 35:33.090
The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

35:34.675 --> 35:37.678
The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.907
[Alex] I saw him by the harbor as well.

36:00.701 --> 36:01.952
He was there.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.291
- He must've been planning this.
- I believe you.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.754
- I could've done something.
- Done something?

36:13.755 --> 36:16.508
Warned them. Called it in. Something.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.222
People around me just get hurt.

36:22.306 --> 36:25.183
No. No, not because of you.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.561
You saved his life.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.319
I need to find Mrs. Jones...

36:36.361 --> 36:38.238
...and talk to the department...

36:39.364 --> 36:41.575
...in case he tries again.

36:43.535 --> 36:44.953
I have to stop this.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.481
Alex.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.199
You sure you wanna
go back to those people?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.787
It's not about what I want.

38:14.501 --> 38:15.502
[grunts]

38:49.494 --> 38:51.121
Hey, Mrs. Jones.

39:51.848 --> 39:53.225
What's that?

39:53.308 --> 39:54.309
Nothing.
