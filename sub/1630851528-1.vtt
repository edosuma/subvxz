NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:49.366 --> 00:50.500
Thank you.

00:50.566 --> 00:52.600
Thank you for coming. Thank you.

01:02.333 --> 01:03.266
Giada.

01:08.133 --> 01:10.066
You have no idea how sorry I am.

01:11.066 --> 01:12.566
I know.

01:20.400 --> 01:23.533
Is he going to play?
What did you say to convince him?

01:23.600 --> 01:26.100
No, nothing. Maybe he convinced himself.

01:49.500 --> 01:54.233
Giulio was not simply
a professor of astrophysics.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.566
Giulio was astrophysics.

01:57.633 --> 02:01.500
Because my dad… my father…

02:04.133 --> 02:06.166
was not only a man who…

02:08.700 --> 02:10.200
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

02:11.766 --> 02:15.166
I am about to graduate because of him.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.633
He was a father to me.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.033
A friend, a master.

02:22.066 --> 02:23.433
Basically, everything.

02:24.133 --> 02:27.166
And he's now doing the one thing
he has never been capable of.

02:27.766 --> 02:28.766
Leaving me alone.

02:35.433 --> 02:36.700
Dear brother Giulio,

02:36.766 --> 02:39.466
everything we have just heard
only confirms--

02:39.533 --> 02:40.600
Excuse me.

02:41.766 --> 02:43.133
Excuse me.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.333
I'd like to say something too.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.533
My father's time is over.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.100
That's what we are here
to celebrate, right?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.633
But you know what? That's not right.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.433
Because time does not exist.

03:29.666 --> 03:32.466
The clearest memory I have of him

03:32.533 --> 03:35.500
is when he was trying
to explain this absurd thing to me.

03:36.166 --> 03:39.733
"Time and space are concepts
that do not exist in the universe,

03:40.000 --> 03:41.633
and what does exist

03:42.366 --> 03:43.533
has already existed,

03:43.600 --> 03:46.600
due to the different perception
of time relative to

03:48.033 --> 03:49.300
"where we are."

03:49.733 --> 03:50.666
I dunno…

03:52.066 --> 03:53.700
I never understood this.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.666
And so,

03:58.300 --> 04:01.000
he told me God was behind this mystery.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.500
I wonder if, in the end,

04:04.366 --> 04:06.700
you solved this mystery, Professor.

04:09.533 --> 04:12.400
What I discovered instead, and not today,

04:13.166 --> 04:15.666
is that time and space,
in real life, exist.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.566
And what you do leaves a mark,

04:19.466 --> 04:20.433
Professor Costa.

04:23.733 --> 04:26.700
At times,
I've felt like a Martian on this Earth.

04:28.033 --> 04:31.666
And so,
if time does not exist, as you say,

04:33.166 --> 04:34.633
I don't have to say goodbye.

04:36.266 --> 04:38.100
If space does not exist,

04:39.133 --> 04:40.666
it means you aren't here.

04:42.133 --> 04:47.066
You are, you were and you will be here,
or on another planet, maybe.

04:49.566 --> 04:51.066
I'll stay here instead,

04:51.600 --> 04:53.400
in this time and this space.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.333
Carrying your mark.

05:07.533 --> 05:11.100
I don't believe you didn't feel anything
seeing him again after 20 years. Come on.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.133
What do you think?

05:14.600 --> 05:17.466
Does the show he just put on
seem normal to you?

05:18.200 --> 05:22.200
-Who shows up dressed like that?
-Who cares how he was dressed?

05:22.266 --> 05:26.333
Sorry, but it was much better
than the formal words of his colleagues.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.100
It was nice of Giada to come.
I didn't expect it.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.333
-I would have liked to say hello to him.
-I don't remember stopping you.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.766
No, you just asked me
to take the young lord to his car.

05:37.033 --> 05:39.400
Didn't you see he couldn't take any more?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.233
-Oh, God, where did he go?
-I don't know.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.066
Oh, God, Carolina. Where is he?

05:45.133 --> 05:47.466
-I don't know! I couldn't lock him in.
-Sebastiano!

05:57.266 --> 05:59.566
I got what you were saying earlier.

06:06.766 --> 06:07.733
Oh yeah?

06:09.233 --> 06:10.133
Really?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.466
Yes. So you also feel…

06:13.200 --> 06:15.200
You feel like a Martian.

06:15.266 --> 06:16.200
Yes.

06:17.033 --> 06:19.766
-Pretty much my whole life.
-Me too. But…

06:20.033 --> 06:21.300
No, not my whole life.

06:21.366 --> 06:23.600
Since I understood how things work.

06:25.266 --> 06:28.466
So, we have something in common, then.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.633
Yes.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.033
Yes.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.133
Today, I…

06:38.500 --> 06:40.033
I brought this, I…

06:41.100 --> 06:42.300
I don't know why.

06:44.033 --> 06:45.766
It's about us.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.333
It's…

06:48.366 --> 06:52.200
Maybe you've read it, I don't know.
If you haven't read it, keep it.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.466
-It's about us?
-Yes.

06:57.033 --> 06:58.100
In what way?

07:01.400 --> 07:03.066
Oh, about us Martians.

07:03.533 --> 07:04.433
Right?

07:04.500 --> 07:05.433
Yes.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.333
Well, it's not my kind of thing,
but I'll read it later.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.466
Listen.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.200
You're one of my father's students, right?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.300
What are you, a future scientist?

07:18.366 --> 07:20.633
You're all a bit odd, aren't you?

07:20.700 --> 07:22.400
-No, I'm--
-Sebastiano?

07:23.400 --> 07:25.766
Come on, darling. Let's go to the car.

07:26.033 --> 07:26.766
Come on.

07:27.033 --> 07:30.100
-Tesla.
-No. Wait, Mom. Wait.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.566
Who is that? Who is he?

07:33.466 --> 07:34.500
Who is he really?

07:34.566 --> 07:37.733
-Come and tell me in the car.
-Why did he say I'm odd?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.300
Let's get in the car.

07:39.366 --> 07:43.200
-He said that I'm odd, an alien.
-Yes, he's wrong. Tell me later.

07:43.266 --> 07:45.133
No, he made a mistake. Come on.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.766
Have I changed that much or were you
pretending not to recognize me?

08:14.233 --> 08:18.766
-Welcome back, Nik. I'm happy to see you.
-We have nothing to say to each other.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.600
Besides, given it's only for a few days,

09:07.666 --> 09:09.466
you could've let him stay.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.533
The door!

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
And what about your brother?

09:15.566 --> 09:18.300
We were this close to major drama.
Come on, Carolina.

09:18.366 --> 09:21.566
What drama, Tesla?
Sebastiano doesn't have the plague!

09:21.633 --> 09:25.766
-I don't want Nik to know, OK?
-You don't want anyone to know.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.033
I'm trying to protect him.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.100
He came all the way here for the funeral.
That must mean something.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.266
Listen carefully.

09:33.533 --> 09:38.133
Your uncle doesn't give a damn
about your grandpa. You don't know him.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.200
Once the will is open
and he gets his money,

09:40.266 --> 09:42.500
God willing,
he'll disappear like he always has.

09:42.566 --> 09:45.533
-Maybe he won't this time.
-Or maybe he will.

09:47.266 --> 09:48.566
And soon, hopefully.

11:15.033 --> 11:15.766
Thank you.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.666
Really, thank you.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.566
Don't mention it. It's no big deal.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.266
You know what I mean.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.566
Look, I'm only trying to persuade

11:25.633 --> 11:28.566
the most talented cellist
at the conservatoire to play with me.

11:29.266 --> 11:30.200
Yes, sure.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.600
It's just that all he's thinking about now
is this mission to Mars.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.133
And these fixations can last months.

11:43.233 --> 11:44.533
And with Dad's death…

11:47.633 --> 11:48.566
Come on.

11:52.700 --> 11:55.400
You know,
I imagined your brother differently.

11:57.066 --> 11:58.100
Yes, me too.

11:58.766 --> 12:00.466
At least, that was my hope.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.200
…you've never accessed it, right?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.100
Huh? Sorry, what?

12:34.033 --> 12:36.200
-Come on, Carolina.
-See? She doesn't listen.

12:36.266 --> 12:38.200
What were you saying? Please.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.000
I was telling Emma about the profile
I made you months ago

12:41.066 --> 12:42.500
already has more followers than mine!

12:42.566 --> 12:44.333
-Again?
-You're going strong.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.333
I'll never use it.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.600
Look how beautiful you look here.

12:49.433 --> 12:50.733
Stop it, please?

12:51.333 --> 12:53.600
God. It's not like
I put you on an escort site.

12:53.666 --> 12:56.133
-What harm will it do?
-Are you joking?

12:56.200 --> 13:00.400
You have no idea what fatal risk she'd run
by getting to know new people,

13:00.466 --> 13:03.200
relaxing, making friends,

13:03.266 --> 13:06.200
taking a break from breathing
down Sebastiano's collar for a day!

13:10.766 --> 13:12.133
It's not for me.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.066
Now, if you'll excuse me.

13:14.133 --> 13:17.433
-You keep eating. Don't worry.
-We finished a while ago.

13:19.033 --> 13:19.766
We.

13:34.700 --> 13:36.500
-Fancy a joint?
-Nik, please.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.700
I'm kidding.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.100
Good morning.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.100
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.100
Tesla.

13:45.233 --> 13:46.600
-Hi.
-Hi, Federico.

13:46.666 --> 13:48.366
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

13:48.433 --> 13:50.366
You must be Nikola, right?

13:50.433 --> 13:52.566
Federico Valmonte,
a friend of your father's.

13:52.633 --> 13:53.600
Hello.

13:59.133 --> 14:02.433
I have to say, I always found the choice
of your names really fun.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.566
Nikola, Tesla.

14:03.633 --> 14:07.233
Only a brilliant mind
like the professor's could come up

14:07.300 --> 14:09.233
with naming you
after a renowned physicist,

14:09.300 --> 14:10.733
Nikola Tesla, but split in two.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.333
Yes, right.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.133
Do you mind if we start?

14:14.200 --> 14:15.133
Sure.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.200
Three more have signed up.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.266
Icelanders.

14:33.433 --> 14:34.566
Do you know them?

14:39.233 --> 14:40.666
Why aren't you answering?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.300
Why aren't you answering?

14:45.366 --> 14:48.766
"I hereby declare that upon my death
I wish to dispose of my assets as follows:

14:49.033 --> 14:50.700
my camper van to my granddaughter Carolina,

14:50.766 --> 14:54.166
and my cello, of equal value,
to my grandson Sebastiano.

14:54.233 --> 14:58.200
Finally, I leave my home located in Rome,
6, via San Giovanni Fabri,

14:58.266 --> 15:00.700
block A, apartment 3, to Tesla Costa,

15:00.766 --> 15:04.433
born in Rome on 17 November 1972,

15:05.100 --> 15:10.400
jointly with my son Nikola Costa,
born in Rome on 25 June 1970,

15:10.466 --> 15:13.066
which they can share equally

15:13.133 --> 15:14.766
as best they see fit.

15:15.766 --> 15:19.600
I declare that I am in possession
of no other movable or immovable assets,

15:19.666 --> 15:22.400
"either registered or referred to me.
Dr. Giulio Costa."

15:23.733 --> 15:25.200
No, wait a second.

15:25.266 --> 15:28.466
That can't be it. You forgot a few pages,
or read it badly. Check again.

15:28.533 --> 15:30.700
No, Tesla, this is everything,

15:30.766 --> 15:33.200
How can that be it? I'm sorry.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.566
He always said he'd leave me the house,
he'd get the money. Where's the money?

15:37.633 --> 15:41.433
Evidently, before dying,
he changed his mind.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.233
So, what happens now?

15:51.133 --> 15:55.266
We can't leave that house.
Federico, we can't. No way.

15:56.266 --> 15:57.366
It wouldn't…

16:00.066 --> 16:02.166
Please, tell me there's an alternative.

16:10.433 --> 16:12.100
Why are you doing this to me?

16:15.433 --> 16:16.300
Me?

16:16.366 --> 16:18.400
Where would I go with two kids in tow?

16:18.466 --> 16:19.766
How should I know?

16:20.033 --> 16:22.066
Sell the house,
and with the money you get,

16:22.133 --> 16:23.633
buy another. What the fuck?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.266
You selfish bastard!

16:25.700 --> 16:28.500
You don't care about anyone or anything!
You never have!

16:28.566 --> 16:29.500
-Excuse me?
-Never!

16:29.566 --> 16:30.500
Excuse me.

16:33.233 --> 16:37.533
I have to give you something else.
Legally, it's not part of the will.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.200
So, we could say
that this was his final wish.

16:44.633 --> 16:45.633
Go on, open them.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.333
"Dear Tesla."

16:57.400 --> 17:01.033
You were wrong and I was right.
Understand? I was right.

17:01.100 --> 17:04.766
I was right from the start.
I told you he wasn't a spy.

17:05.033 --> 17:07.100
He wasn't a spy. He's my uncle.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.466
He's Uncle Nik, yes.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.366
Kelvin, stop. Stop!

17:17.033 --> 17:19.500
Do you understand?
So we have nothing to worry about. Stop.

17:20.266 --> 17:22.000
We have nothing to worry about.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.166
He gave them to me already sealed

17:24.233 --> 17:27.266
and asked me to give you them
after the will had been read.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.633
I don't know what they contain.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.600
Jesus Christ.

17:33.666 --> 17:36.166
I bet the bastard even begged.

17:37.466 --> 17:39.066
That piece of shit.

17:50.633 --> 17:52.466
What do I do now?

18:04.366 --> 18:05.300
How did it go?

18:06.666 --> 18:09.400
-Did he disappear as you said?
-No.

18:10.233 --> 18:11.233
Unfortunately not.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.133
Why unfortunately?

18:15.066 --> 18:17.500
Because your grandpa
didn't leave any money.

18:18.266 --> 18:20.100
He only left this house.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.766
And so?

18:22.033 --> 18:23.033
And so,

18:23.533 --> 18:26.433
either we have to sell it
and share the money with your uncle…

18:28.433 --> 18:29.366
or…

18:30.133 --> 18:31.066
What's this?

18:35.666 --> 18:37.666
Your grandfather's final wish.

18:38.266 --> 18:40.466
Oh, I forgot. He left you a camper van.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.733
-A camper van?
-A camper van, yes.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.633
No way.
So Uncle Nik has to come and live here?

18:52.700 --> 18:57.166
-But legally, you aren't obligated.
-Legally or not, that's how it is.

18:57.566 --> 18:58.566
That's how it is.

18:59.700 --> 19:01.766
He might not agree to it, right?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.433
Oh, he will.

19:03.766 --> 19:08.100
Now he knows he won't get a euro,
he might hope to start a new life here.

19:08.666 --> 19:10.600
-What a mess.
-A huge mess.

19:10.666 --> 19:12.066
A year's a long time.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.233
And how will we manage
when we only have three bedrooms?

19:16.633 --> 19:21.133
Because the bedrooms are the problem?
What about your brother? Excuse me!

19:21.200 --> 19:24.500
You know that every change
can trigger a crisis for him.

19:24.566 --> 19:26.433
Imagine having a stranger here.

19:26.500 --> 19:29.400
He's not a stranger though.
He's his uncle.

19:29.466 --> 19:33.500
-Once you explain it to him--
-I don't want Nik to know, OK?

19:33.566 --> 19:36.466
-How will you do that?
-We'll say he's depressed.

19:36.533 --> 19:38.533
Because of his granddad's death.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.466
And that it's best to ignore him.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.033
For a year?

19:43.733 --> 19:45.700
Tesla, you must get your head checked.

19:45.766 --> 19:48.200
It was already difficult,
but a year of this farce?

19:48.266 --> 19:49.766
No way. It's not tolerable.

19:50.700 --> 19:53.166
I know what's best for him, Carolina!

20:17.700 --> 20:18.733
Unbelievable.

20:19.400 --> 20:22.100
This house still smells the same
as it did 20 years ago.

20:24.666 --> 20:26.633
No, this isn't going to work.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.600
-No.
-Even if it is different. Yes.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.733
Yes, I can see your touch.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.466
You've managed to make it even,

20:36.400 --> 20:37.700
even more…

20:37.766 --> 20:39.100
I don't know what.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.100
Look.

20:41.200 --> 20:44.000
Let's get something clear. OK?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.166
Hey, Seba.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.100
-I'm sorry--
-Nik.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.100
We live here.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.700
You're just a temporary guest,
and not out of choice.

20:54.766 --> 20:57.166
Yes, but you're starting
from the wrong premise

20:57.233 --> 20:59.433
because legally, this is also my house.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.733
By our father's will, right?

21:02.766 --> 21:03.700
So?

21:04.700 --> 21:05.733
Where's my room?

21:07.166 --> 21:11.266
Wow, the blue sofa's still here. Nice one,
you didn't throw it away. Well done.

21:12.566 --> 21:13.733
Why are you provoking me?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.500
-Come on.
-Yes, tell me. Why? You really enjoy it?

21:16.566 --> 21:20.433
-I want to know how we're organizing this.
-You enjoy provoking me?

21:20.500 --> 21:22.400
The blue sofa's really comfy.

21:23.333 --> 21:26.400
I don't know how we're organizing it.
You like it? Sleep there.

21:26.466 --> 21:30.366
You can stop talking about it.
Uncle Nik can use my room.

21:30.433 --> 21:33.000
-There you go.
-What? What are you saying?

21:33.066 --> 21:35.266
A year on the sofa?
Have you thought this through?

21:35.333 --> 21:38.133
Maybe you haven't understood.
I'm leaving home.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.633
Are you kidding? Where will you go, sorry?

21:41.700 --> 21:44.300
I don't know. I'll figure it out.
It's not your problem.

21:44.366 --> 21:48.700
Carolina, please, put the bag down.
Things are already really difficult.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.466
Now you're starting too?
Do you want to punish me?

21:51.533 --> 21:55.133
How can you always think that
the world only revolves around you?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.500
I'm not doing it to punish you.
I'm doing it for me.

21:58.100 --> 22:00.533
Nothing changes whether I'm here or not.

22:01.533 --> 22:05.333
What are you saying?
Think about how your brother will take it!

22:05.400 --> 22:09.166
-It was nice to see you. Bye, Uncle Nik.
-No, wait.

22:09.733 --> 22:11.766
If the blue sofa is the problem,

22:12.466 --> 22:14.200
your mom can sleep on it, right?

22:14.733 --> 22:17.433
Bye, Tesla.
I'll come by for my clothes when I can.

22:17.500 --> 22:20.233
-Carolina.
-Don't touch anything in my room.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.200
Come here, Carolina. Please.
Can we talk for a second?

22:24.266 --> 22:25.666
Why does she call you Tesla?

22:26.433 --> 22:27.400
Fuck you.

22:30.366 --> 22:31.733
This should be it.

22:32.433 --> 22:36.566
I would've expected anything from him
except he'd leave me a camper van.

22:36.633 --> 22:38.633
I think it's super cool.

22:39.466 --> 22:42.366
Who knows, maybe he knew
I was gonna leave home.

22:54.366 --> 22:55.400
Hey.

22:55.466 --> 22:57.100
Come in if you want to.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.233
Your grandpa sure was strange.

22:59.766 --> 23:01.133
Definitely.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.200
Think of the surprises in those letters.

23:04.266 --> 23:05.366
Did you read them?

23:05.433 --> 23:08.166
-Only Tesla's.
-What did it say?

23:08.233 --> 23:12.000
Basically, since money doesn't
bring happiness but love does,

23:12.066 --> 23:15.533
before leaving the house
in which she and Nik grew up,

23:15.600 --> 23:19.566
he begged them to live there together
for a year before deciding.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.200
A year?

23:22.066 --> 23:25.566
Now you get why I couldn't
spend another minute in that house.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.733
I bet it won't start.

23:39.100 --> 23:40.400
You lost that bet.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.566
Good evening.

23:57.233 --> 24:00.466
-What's for dinner?
-Get that stinky sweater off there.

24:01.266 --> 24:04.433
And then, I seem to remember
asking you explicitly

24:04.500 --> 24:07.000
to take your shoes off when you come in.

24:13.433 --> 24:17.300
I swear on my kids,
if you leave those there, I'll burn them.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.233
Are we going to fight for a year?

24:20.666 --> 24:22.133
Is that what you want?

24:27.166 --> 24:29.166
One of us will give up sooner or later.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.600
And it won't be me.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.200
So let's make a truce,
at least while we eat.

24:35.266 --> 24:39.433
If you tell me where the pans are,
I'll make myself some pasta, carbonara.

24:39.500 --> 24:40.466
No, listen.

24:42.433 --> 24:45.466
Sebastiano eats in his room,
and I'm not hungry.

24:47.666 --> 24:51.200
Oh, how I've missed
the cheerful atmosphere of this family.

24:53.233 --> 24:54.500
I'll sort myself out.

24:57.266 --> 25:00.466
What you and I share from now on
is nothing but a roof.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.133
I'm not getting your groceries.

25:05.666 --> 25:06.700
That seems fair.

25:11.300 --> 25:14.133
I didn't see Paolo at the funeral.
How come?

25:18.200 --> 25:20.100
We broke up. Eight years ago.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.033
Or rather,

25:23.433 --> 25:25.166
he left me, eight years ago.

25:27.166 --> 25:30.633
He met a woman, had two kids with her,
and now he's in Turin.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.666
Fuck. How come?

25:34.733 --> 25:36.300
You missed so many things, Nik.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.533
That's true.
But I'm not the only one who did.

25:41.633 --> 25:44.600
-Here, I'll take my nephew his dinner.
-No! Let go.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.066
-Can I?
-No.

25:46.133 --> 25:47.633
-Come on!
-Let go!

25:47.700 --> 25:50.466
What's his problem with me?
It's like he's scared of me.

25:51.266 --> 25:53.400
Sebastiano isn't scared of anything.

25:53.466 --> 25:56.433
Sebastiano is just a very sensitive boy

25:56.500 --> 25:59.333
who's going through
a tough time, all right?

25:59.400 --> 26:01.366
The more we leave him alone, the better.

26:01.766 --> 26:04.300
And I'll bring him his dinner, thank you.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.233
Are you mad? Turn that fucking music down!

26:17.300 --> 26:18.733
Cover yourself up!

26:19.000 --> 26:21.100
-Why?
-Because you're naked. Why?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.166
I'm in the bathroom.

26:24.433 --> 26:25.666
Turn the music down.

26:26.366 --> 26:28.500
Sebastiano can't sleep with this noise.

26:28.566 --> 26:31.366
-Did he ask you to tell me that?
-Turn it down!

26:38.033 --> 26:40.766
Come on, Tesla. It's 9:00 p.m.
You're being ridiculous.

26:41.366 --> 26:43.566
That's the interpretation
conducted by Piris,

26:43.633 --> 26:46.033
one of the best recent versions.

26:46.100 --> 26:47.400
-Yes.
-Yes.

26:47.466 --> 26:51.233
-OK. Go to your room, honey.
-No, not quite but you're close.

26:52.066 --> 26:55.266
No, impossible. I can't be wrong.
This is it. I can't be wrong.

26:55.333 --> 26:58.000
It's the Angel version.
I'll send it to you tomorrow.

26:58.633 --> 27:02.266
-He'll send it to you tomorrow.
-He'll send it to me tomorrow. OK.

27:07.033 --> 27:09.100
Didn't look like he was asleep.

27:09.733 --> 27:11.466
You're a real dick, Nik.

27:12.666 --> 27:14.633
And don't walk around like that!

27:54.033 --> 27:59.000
I WAS IN HERE!

28:16.100 --> 28:17.233
Can I sit there?

28:17.300 --> 28:18.433
Of course you can.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.300
I was on the phone with your mom.

28:27.033 --> 28:29.200
She's really upset that you left.

28:29.266 --> 28:31.633
I didn't tell her
you wanted to sleep in the camper van

28:31.700 --> 28:34.433
or she'd have done everything
in her power to stop you.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.666
I could have slept in there
with no problem.

28:36.733 --> 28:39.366
And I really don't want to put you out.

28:39.433 --> 28:40.366
Carolina,

28:41.100 --> 28:42.600
I'm happy that you're here.

28:44.233 --> 28:47.100
And Sebastiano?
He's really mad at me, isn't he?

28:49.233 --> 28:51.233
No, your mom didn't say anything.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.366
All right,
he's feeling a bit better now, isn't he?

28:58.433 --> 29:01.166
Sure. He wants to move to Mars.

29:01.633 --> 29:04.166
Who doesn't want to move to Mars?

29:07.066 --> 29:08.366
-Come on.
-Thank you, Emma.

29:08.433 --> 29:12.433
But, really, I don't want
to dump all my family's problems on you.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.433
Carolina,

29:15.266 --> 29:16.200
really.

29:16.600 --> 29:17.633
Good night.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.133
Night.

29:34.266 --> 29:36.066
DAD

29:40.266 --> 29:42.633
NO CURRY IN THE CHICKEN.
SEBA DOESN'T WANT IT ANYMORE.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.266
HELP!

30:06.733 --> 30:09.033
HI, DAD. WE LOST GRANDPA TODAY.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.000
DAD - OFFLINE

30:10.066 --> 30:11.366
DAD - ONLINE

30:14.533 --> 30:16.266
WHAT MUST I DO TO HEAR FROM YOU?

30:17.166 --> 30:18.400
DAD - OFFLINE

30:25.566 --> 30:27.133
Kitesurfing. Yes.

30:28.366 --> 30:30.033
OK. No, sorry.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.200
What about classical music, then?

30:33.300 --> 30:36.400
I don't know. So?

30:37.200 --> 30:39.700
Oh, OK. Hang on.

30:40.533 --> 30:42.700
Stop. So, what are you trying to say?

30:44.233 --> 30:47.466
OK, so it's just a way in,
a way to show I trust him.

30:49.100 --> 30:50.100
OK.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.533
Got it.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.566
I got it.

30:52.633 --> 30:54.733
Yes, that's it.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.300
OK, so what do I do?

30:56.700 --> 30:59.400
I go to see him, and I say,

30:59.466 --> 31:02.633
"I know they've sent you.
You aren't my uncle."

31:02.700 --> 31:03.733
Do I say that?

31:04.433 --> 31:07.066
I tell him, "I know you aren't my uncle."

31:50.100 --> 31:51.566
IMIPRAMINE

31:56.700 --> 31:59.666
IMIPRAMINE IS AN ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUG

31:59.733 --> 32:01.300
ARIPIPRAZOLE IS AN ANTIPSYCHOTIC

32:03.633 --> 32:06.133
USAGE: SCHIZOPHRENIA
MANIC EPISODES

32:16.166 --> 32:17.466
Good morning, darling.

32:19.566 --> 32:21.366
-Shall I open the curtains?
-No.

32:22.433 --> 32:23.566
Did you open them?

32:23.633 --> 32:25.600
-Don't open them.
-No, I didn't.

32:26.233 --> 32:27.433
I brought your breakfast.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.366
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.533
Sebastiano,

32:32.366 --> 32:34.000
will you do Mom a favor?

32:37.500 --> 32:40.033
Have a shower and get dressed today, OK?

32:40.600 --> 32:41.666
Promise me?

32:46.466 --> 32:48.133
I wanted to stay home,

32:48.600 --> 32:51.600
but there's a teachers' meeting
and I can't skip it.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.333
But I'll be back soon, OK?

32:56.366 --> 32:58.033
Sebastiano, look at me.

32:59.666 --> 33:01.200
If you need anything,

33:01.266 --> 33:03.166
call me or Carolina.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.533
Leave Uncle Nik alone. OK?

33:10.133 --> 33:11.100
Bye, honey.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.733
Kel…

33:26.400 --> 33:30.366
Kelvin, the same story every time.
I told you that you should…

33:32.100 --> 33:34.266
No, I have to take one, Kelvin.

33:34.333 --> 33:37.566
I won't take them all,
but I have to take one, get it?

33:40.266 --> 33:42.266
Yes, I told you I have to take it.

33:52.066 --> 33:54.400
At least they'll leave us alone this way.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.466
I'm going to work.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.266
I've written down some house rules
and some useful numbers.

34:03.333 --> 34:07.200
Do any of those useful numbers
teach you how to say good morning?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.000
When was he diagnosed with schizophrenia?

34:20.300 --> 34:21.233
Tesla.

34:23.133 --> 34:24.566
I spent the night online.

34:24.633 --> 34:26.699
There's a load of bullshit written online.

34:27.333 --> 34:31.366
Did you read that every change in routine
can be detrimental to him?

34:31.766 --> 34:34.033
Fuck the routine. I'm your brother.

34:34.500 --> 34:35.433
Really?

34:36.066 --> 34:37.333
Come on. How long ago?

34:41.199 --> 34:42.300
Five years.

34:42.766 --> 34:45.366
-Five years?
-Yes, more or less five years.

34:45.766 --> 34:49.233
I get it, but you can't hide
something like that from me.

34:49.300 --> 34:51.133
Why not?

34:51.199 --> 34:55.300
Would you have suddenly remembered
you have a sister and a family, Nik?

34:56.633 --> 34:58.500
Even if I'd wanted to, how could I?

34:58.566 --> 35:02.233
I don't know where in the world you live.
You never answer the phone.

35:04.233 --> 35:05.666
Fine, well, I'm here now.

35:05.733 --> 35:08.533
Just so I understand,
were you not going to tell me? Why?

35:09.700 --> 35:10.733
Why?

35:11.733 --> 35:15.100
I'm fed up with giving explanations,
with pitying respect.

35:15.166 --> 35:18.666
Because even the word "schizophrenia,"
is scary, Nik. You know?

35:18.733 --> 35:22.000
And it's not just the looks
of people who pity you,

35:22.066 --> 35:26.133
those who want to teach you how to live,
or those you have to apologize to

35:26.200 --> 35:29.266
because "Ma'am, you do know
your son is saying strange things?"

35:29.333 --> 35:31.100
"Your son's doing strange things."

35:31.166 --> 35:32.466
I'm fed up with it!

35:32.533 --> 35:36.166
I no longer have the time or will
to explain, to apologize.

35:36.233 --> 35:40.433
Enough! I just have to protect him
from everyone and everything. Get it?

35:41.633 --> 35:43.133
Why don't you sit down?

35:44.600 --> 35:45.533
Look…

35:47.600 --> 35:48.533
please, Nik,

35:49.433 --> 35:51.066
don't make me worry.

35:51.133 --> 35:53.533
Leave Sebastiano alone. Leave him alone.

35:56.033 --> 35:56.766
OK.

36:00.366 --> 36:03.033
OK, we're alone.
Tell me who you are. What are you?

36:03.100 --> 36:05.466
Who are you? What do you want from me?

36:06.400 --> 36:08.133
-I--
-I was too direct.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.466
I was too direct.
I knew I was being too direct.

36:11.533 --> 36:14.366
No, you weren't too direct.
Let's talk about it.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.100
Sebastiano.

36:18.566 --> 36:19.566
Let's talk.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.600
-Good morning.
-Hey. Good morning.

36:29.666 --> 36:31.366
You're up early today.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.333
There's some coffee left if you want it.

36:34.733 --> 36:35.666
Thank you.

36:47.100 --> 36:48.333
How lovely!

36:49.000 --> 36:50.033
You like them?

36:52.266 --> 36:55.133
Are you still set on the idea
of sleeping in the camper van?

36:56.566 --> 36:59.200
Actually, I had another idea last night,

36:59.266 --> 37:01.266
which I don't think is crazy at all.

37:02.033 --> 37:02.766
Which is?

37:04.033 --> 37:06.133
Oh, God. Can you pass it to me, please?

37:06.200 --> 37:09.233
It will no doubt be Sebastiano
asking me to go home.

37:10.166 --> 37:12.033
No, it's not.

37:12.433 --> 37:14.266
I know you don't want to speak to me,

37:14.333 --> 37:17.133
but Nik found everything out,
and he's alone with Sebastiano.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.166
Will you please pop by the house
and check? Please.

37:21.266 --> 37:22.700
See what I have to deal with?

37:22.766 --> 37:25.066
It's normal for her to worry, Caro.

37:26.300 --> 37:28.000
Hi, Tesla. Good morning.

37:28.066 --> 37:31.066
Didn't I tell you yesterday
it was stupid to hide it from him?

37:31.533 --> 37:34.400
But you're in luck.
I have to go get my clothes anyway.

37:34.466 --> 37:35.700
So, yes, I'll check.

37:35.766 --> 37:40.166
But I'd appreciate it if you didn't
involve me in your stupid obsessions.

37:40.233 --> 37:41.166
Thank you.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.533
What?

37:47.166 --> 37:49.066
I don't know, Carolina.

37:49.133 --> 37:52.666
I think you should resolve this thing
with your mother, sooner or later.

37:53.266 --> 37:57.100
What? That I don't call her mom?
I don't feel like it. What can I say?

37:57.166 --> 37:59.533
-Come on, I'm being serious.
-All right.

38:01.133 --> 38:03.300
Would you mind coming with me?

38:03.366 --> 38:07.033
I don't think Sebastiano will be as pissed
if you're there.

38:07.100 --> 38:11.266
Why should Seba be angry?
I bet he already misses you tons.

38:15.200 --> 38:17.733
Yes, it's all lovely, but…

38:19.000 --> 38:21.533
I'd be terrified to go to Mars,
knowing that.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.666
I wouldn't be able to come back to Earth.

38:25.266 --> 38:27.433
-Wouldn't you?
-I'm scared too.

38:27.500 --> 38:31.233
Oh, so why are you going?
Nobody's forcing you to.

38:31.300 --> 38:35.733
No, I have to, because who's going
to take the classical music if I don't?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.066
I have to take it.

38:37.133 --> 38:38.566
I understand. Of course.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.366
-A commitment is a commitment.
-Yeah.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.500
You didn't know anything?

38:50.400 --> 38:51.566
No, believe me, I didn't.

38:53.733 --> 38:55.133
And so why,

38:56.200 --> 39:00.500
why did you say those things
at the funeral the other day? Why?

39:01.333 --> 39:03.333
I don't know. It just came out like that.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.200
Look, ask me about

39:06.066 --> 39:07.333
the sea, the wind,

39:07.400 --> 39:09.466
coral reefs, beautiful women,

39:09.533 --> 39:12.600
but not about space, stars, and the sky

39:12.666 --> 39:14.600
because I don't understand shit.

39:15.633 --> 39:20.166
No, because you wanted to be a musician,
not an astronomer.

39:21.266 --> 39:24.233
I remember Grandpa telling me
about you. He said…

39:24.733 --> 39:27.666
he said you were amazing
at playing the piano.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.300
And when he said it, he cried. He cried.

39:32.300 --> 39:36.400
OK. I'll leave you to your job.
I'm going to look for one at the beach.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.366
No one looks for one there.

39:39.466 --> 39:40.466
Well, I do.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.333
Why don't you come too?

39:49.033 --> 39:49.766
No.

39:50.566 --> 39:52.533
I can't go to the beach with you.

39:54.066 --> 39:55.400
OK, some other time.

39:55.466 --> 39:57.266
Yes, some other time.

40:01.266 --> 40:02.633
A bit of Earthlight.

40:09.233 --> 40:10.533
Are you convinced now?

40:11.166 --> 40:12.233
Are you convinced?

40:16.766 --> 40:19.733
I told you so.
I told you so. You have to trust me.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Understand? You have to trust me.

40:24.600 --> 40:29.066
Enough. Look, keep breaking my balls
and I'll go with him. Stop.

40:47.333 --> 40:48.433
Hey, Seba.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.300
Where were you going?

40:52.166 --> 40:54.333
Me? Nowhere. What are you doing here?

40:54.400 --> 40:57.066
I came to get my clothes. Emma's here too.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.166
Want to say hello?

40:58.233 --> 40:59.200
Hey, Seba.

41:01.766 --> 41:05.233
No, it's not rehearsal time.
It's not rehearsal time now.

41:05.300 --> 41:08.566
I didn't come for rehearsal.
I came to help your sister.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.366
Who sent you? Mom?

41:13.433 --> 41:15.233
-No. Absolutely not.
-No.

41:21.533 --> 41:24.033
What was that story
about him already missing me?

41:39.733 --> 41:41.400
Are you following me?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.366
Did I have a choice?

41:50.300 --> 41:53.066
How can I make you understand
I have nothing to say to you?

41:54.166 --> 41:56.733
-Why haven't you left yet?
-That's my business.

42:00.233 --> 42:02.333
I'll give you a lift. You can tell me.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.666
Given my current life situation,

43:00.733 --> 43:03.400
I'm going to need more money
to live on my own, right?

43:03.466 --> 43:04.666
Right. So?

43:04.733 --> 43:08.133
OK, so, since I have a huge passion
for fashion, taste,

43:08.200 --> 43:09.666
and a few contacts,

43:09.733 --> 43:12.433
there was only one thing
I was missing until now.

43:13.033 --> 43:14.533
A rich sponsor?

43:14.600 --> 43:15.566
A store.

43:16.733 --> 43:18.533
And actually, now I have one.

43:21.566 --> 43:22.566
Where is it?

43:24.566 --> 43:25.500
Here.

43:26.100 --> 43:29.100
If customers don't come to me,
I'll go to them.

43:29.166 --> 43:31.733
Basically,
stalking for commercial purposes.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.533
That's a great idea.
It might work, you know?

43:34.600 --> 43:36.300
How are you planning to do it?

43:37.233 --> 43:38.666
With the help of a friend.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.333
Get changed.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.400
I don't know.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.133
Kitesurfing doesn't sound
like a sufficient reason

43:54.200 --> 43:55.600
to permanently cut all your ties.

43:55.666 --> 43:58.266
That's what I've always thought too.

43:58.333 --> 44:01.700
But whenever he was mentioned,
she'd change the subject.

44:02.366 --> 44:04.533
I always imagined that at some point,

44:04.600 --> 44:07.466
he could no longer bear the pressure
of a father

44:07.533 --> 44:09.733
who was too demanding of his children.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.366
He didn't seem that way to me.

44:11.433 --> 44:14.500
We were his grandkids.
Everything was easier with us.

44:15.100 --> 44:17.733
I guess he had far too many expectations
of his children.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.766
And they simply reacted in different ways.

44:22.033 --> 44:25.766
Reacting doesn't mean leaving everything
for the sun and sea forever.

44:26.033 --> 44:29.300
Nor does it mean staying and living
your life like it's a jail sentence.

44:29.366 --> 44:31.700
We're all the architects of our own fate.

44:31.766 --> 44:35.500
Exactly. Your mom raised a family.
What has Nik built?

44:35.566 --> 44:38.366
What's he left with? A kiteboard?

44:38.433 --> 44:41.166
It could just be that he's happy this way.

44:41.233 --> 44:42.600
No, I don't think so.

44:43.333 --> 44:48.133
Living in a faraway place,
alone, without any stable relationships.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.633
You can feel alone even in a family.

44:51.433 --> 44:55.633
At times, given the alternatives,
a kiteboard can be a lot more company.

44:56.700 --> 44:57.766
What do you think?

44:58.566 --> 44:59.633
I think it's cute.

44:59.700 --> 45:02.666
You're officially in business.
We should celebrate.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.200
Please don't say anything
to Tesla and Seba.

45:06.266 --> 45:10.233
Oh, God, Seba. What time is it?
I was supposed to be rehearsing with him.

45:10.633 --> 45:12.333
OK. Bye.

45:24.266 --> 45:26.566
So I'm the only Italian going to Mars?

45:26.666 --> 45:28.533
PIETRO ARINALDI:
"GOODBYE MARS, I'M GIVING UP FOR LOVE."

45:28.600 --> 45:29.533
Understand?

45:34.733 --> 45:36.533
No. I'm not…

45:36.600 --> 45:39.400
No,
I'd never give up for love like he did.

45:40.133 --> 45:41.100
Well,

45:41.733 --> 45:46.033
well, Emma's pretty, but not…

45:46.100 --> 45:48.100
Sebastiano? Hi, darling.

45:50.600 --> 45:51.533
Everything OK?

45:57.300 --> 45:58.233
Well done.

45:59.533 --> 46:01.633
Seen what a beautiful day it is?

46:05.166 --> 46:06.466
Everything OK with Uncle Nik?

46:10.033 --> 46:11.500
I'll take this away.

46:13.566 --> 46:16.466
Will you have a nice shower?
Emma's coming today.

46:27.666 --> 46:31.666
With everything we have to do,
the concert is all we need now.

46:34.333 --> 46:35.300
What a pain.

46:36.766 --> 46:38.333
What a pain.

46:48.500 --> 46:49.633
Hi.

46:50.733 --> 46:51.700
Who are you?

47:03.166 --> 47:05.366
Sebastiano, darling,
aren't you having a shower?

47:05.766 --> 47:09.133
-The bathroom's being used.
-Used by Uncle Nik?

47:10.066 --> 47:12.633
No, it's being used by a naked lady.

47:14.100 --> 47:16.400
-By a?
-By a naked lady.

47:17.133 --> 47:18.633
-A naked lady?
-Yes.

47:19.566 --> 47:20.666
A naked lady?

47:26.333 --> 47:27.266
Oh, God!

47:28.533 --> 47:30.266
Excuse me, but who are you?

47:30.333 --> 47:31.666
Ambra. Hi.

47:32.400 --> 47:33.766
Lovely robe, by the way.

47:34.500 --> 47:37.666
Is it yours? Excuse me,
otherwise I'd get the whole house wet.

47:43.433 --> 47:44.366
Nik.

47:47.233 --> 47:48.200
Nik!

47:48.266 --> 47:49.200
Yeah?

47:50.400 --> 47:53.566
-Nik!
-Why are you shouting? I'm here. What?

47:54.166 --> 47:55.166
Who is that?

47:55.233 --> 47:58.000
-Huh?
-Who's that woman in my bathroom?

47:58.700 --> 48:03.433
It's our bathroom, to be exact.
And that's Ambra. Her name's Ambra.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.633
-Oh, her name's Ambra. That's OK, then?
-Yes.

48:06.700 --> 48:08.000
What the fuck?

48:08.066 --> 48:12.233
Listen, it's our bathroom,
our house. I'll invite whoever I want.

48:12.300 --> 48:13.233
Yes, sure.

48:13.300 --> 48:17.500
After you naked, now a naked lady,
who even put on my robe. How gross!

48:17.566 --> 48:21.100
-Can I say "my" or is that shared too?
-Not "a naked lady."

48:21.166 --> 48:24.033
Her name's Ambra. Call her Ambra.

48:24.100 --> 48:27.000
You do realize this isn't a nudist beach?

48:27.066 --> 48:30.066
Do I need to put up a sign?
Sebastiano was the one who found her.

48:30.133 --> 48:32.133
-Did you know that?
-OK, and?

48:32.233 --> 48:34.500
Of course. Because you can't know.

48:34.566 --> 48:38.366
You don't know how stressful it is
for him to find a stranger in his space.

48:38.433 --> 48:39.666
You don't know.

48:39.733 --> 48:43.666
-A naked lady. Naked!
-Yes. He's 20.

48:43.733 --> 48:45.366
He might've liked it.

48:46.400 --> 48:50.400
He didn't seem so stressed to me.
You're the only one who's stressed.

48:50.466 --> 48:51.466
Understandably.

48:51.533 --> 48:53.233
Oh really? Why? Tell me.

48:53.300 --> 48:55.600
-Because--
-Because? No, tell me. Why?

48:59.100 --> 49:00.566
See you at the beach?

49:01.733 --> 49:03.566
-Thanks for the robe.
-You're welcome.

49:03.633 --> 49:05.533
I left it in the room. Will you get it?

49:05.600 --> 49:07.300
-Yes.
-Bye.

49:08.700 --> 49:12.100
See? She's like family.
What the fuck do you want?

49:13.200 --> 49:16.600
I won't cope. I won't cope
with a year like this. Are you kidding?

49:16.666 --> 49:20.700
Instead of asking if you'll cope with me,
try asking if others can cope with you.

49:20.766 --> 49:23.033
I'm not the only one thinking it!

49:23.100 --> 49:24.033
Fuck!

49:24.633 --> 49:28.433
We were all living here happily
until the prodigal son returned.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.633
-You know that?
-Yes, happily…

49:30.700 --> 49:33.400
That seems like an accurate description.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.400
Like in fairy tales!

49:39.133 --> 49:40.066
Hi.

49:41.200 --> 49:44.200
I'm so sorry, Tesla.
I'm so late today. I'm sorry.

49:47.333 --> 49:48.733
What's with the long face?

49:49.566 --> 49:52.600
It's nothing. I had a fight
with my idiotic brother.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.300
How's Carolina?

49:55.600 --> 49:57.000
Carolina's fine.

49:57.566 --> 49:58.633
She says hi.

49:59.666 --> 50:00.666
Yeah, right…

50:03.733 --> 50:05.700
Tesla, you can't go on like this.

50:06.300 --> 50:08.066
The two of you, I mean.

50:09.133 --> 50:10.200
I'm tired.

50:10.666 --> 50:13.500
With her, with everyone,
everything I do is wrong.

50:14.633 --> 50:16.000
Apart from Sebastiano.

50:16.766 --> 50:17.766
Thank you.

50:19.766 --> 50:20.700
So, Seba,

50:20.766 --> 50:25.300
for the theme of this sonata, I'll start
on the piano, like in the original.

50:25.366 --> 50:28.233
And after two beats,
you come in on the cello.

50:30.666 --> 50:34.033
How about we try
even the opening of the piece?

50:34.100 --> 50:35.133
No.

50:35.200 --> 50:38.133
-Just that bit.
-No, I can't do it today.

50:41.100 --> 50:42.166
I can't do it.

50:44.533 --> 50:46.200
OK, it's no big deal.

50:46.266 --> 50:48.000
So today we won't rehearse.

50:53.366 --> 50:55.700
No. I have to go. I'm sorry.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.666
-Hi.
-Hi.

51:04.733 --> 51:06.233
-You're…
-Emma.

51:06.300 --> 51:07.500
Emma. Of course.

51:08.300 --> 51:09.333
Are you leaving?

51:10.266 --> 51:12.433
-Why? Am I not allowed to?
-Of course you are.

51:13.133 --> 51:16.166
But since I always get an extra pizza
just in case,

51:16.233 --> 51:20.366
para compartir, as they do in Costa Rica,
if you're happy with Margherita, maybe…

51:20.433 --> 51:25.033
-Because you live in Costa Rica?
-Yes, I kitesurf and… do other things.

51:25.100 --> 51:26.033
Well?

51:26.700 --> 51:28.766
-Well, what?
-The Margherita.

51:29.033 --> 51:32.233
Listen, you'd be the first person
I invite to my home.

51:33.066 --> 51:35.133
Yes. No.

51:35.633 --> 51:37.500
Really, I just said goodbye to everyone.

51:37.566 --> 51:40.033
I don't think it's a good idea
to go back in.

51:40.100 --> 51:43.566
I don't want Sebastiano to think
I'm putting pressure on him.

51:43.633 --> 51:47.633
You're the last person
who could put pressure on Sebastiano.

51:47.700 --> 51:50.500
Trust me.
Come on, the pizzas are getting cold.

51:51.300 --> 51:55.166
No, really. I promised Carolina
I'd join her after the lesson.

51:55.733 --> 51:57.733
-Thank you.
-How's Carolina doing?

51:59.666 --> 52:01.633
OK. Carolina's OK.

52:02.366 --> 52:06.033
It's a time of great change for her.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.233
-But she's fine.
-Tell her I'm sorry.

52:10.133 --> 52:12.133
I think she'd be happier if you told her.

52:12.200 --> 52:16.400
OK, I will. But let's go in now,
before the pizzas get cold. We're here!

52:19.066 --> 52:21.266
Oh, no! The beers. Fuck.

52:21.333 --> 52:23.400
I even paid for them. What a moron!

52:24.000 --> 52:24.733
Tesla!

52:25.366 --> 52:28.200
I hope you haven't cooked.
Pizza for everyone.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.300
Et voilà!

52:33.566 --> 52:35.566
I told him it was a bad idea but--

52:35.633 --> 52:40.300
Here! Margherita with a mountain of basil,
rigorously fresh for you.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.433
Capricciosa for young Sebastiano.

52:42.500 --> 52:44.166
Capricciosa for me.

52:44.700 --> 52:46.166
And for our guest…

52:46.566 --> 52:47.633
Thank you.

52:48.633 --> 52:51.633
Margherita a compartir.

52:51.700 --> 52:52.733
How did work go?

52:54.500 --> 52:58.066
Good. Really good.
A replacement, nothing special. But…

53:00.133 --> 53:01.066
better than nothing.

53:01.700 --> 53:04.333
Why don't you come next time?
So you'll see.

53:04.400 --> 53:08.133
-Yes, I want to come.
-I'll show you my kite, yeah?

53:09.200 --> 53:11.466
-Yes. Good.
-I'll go with him.

53:16.400 --> 53:19.133
Can I try yours? Shall we swap slices?

53:25.166 --> 53:26.266
The glasses…

53:27.366 --> 53:28.366
I'll get them.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.600
NEW VOICE MESSAGE
LISTEN

53:56.266 --> 53:57.166
Hi, darling.

53:57.233 --> 54:00.166
This is my thousandth message.
This is the only way to talk to you.

54:00.233 --> 54:02.766
You know Sebastiano ate with us
at the table tonight?

54:03.033 --> 54:04.266
And you? How are you?

54:12.700 --> 54:14.766
-What are you doing here?
-Hi, Caro.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.566
Don't worry, Emma only told me.

54:21.733 --> 54:23.633
I came to tell you.

54:25.366 --> 54:27.633
I'm sorry for causing you a problem.

54:29.766 --> 54:31.066
Basically…

54:33.566 --> 54:35.600
I arrived and you left, so…

54:37.566 --> 54:40.066
Well, you didn't cause me a problem.

54:41.600 --> 54:42.566
In fact,

54:43.266 --> 54:45.766
you might've given me
just the push I needed.

54:46.366 --> 54:49.300
Sure, but if I'd been around, you--
Sorry, can you stop?

54:50.166 --> 54:51.100
Stay still.

54:54.100 --> 54:57.433
If I'd been around all these years,
things might've gone better.

54:58.033 --> 54:59.133
Or maybe worse.

55:00.700 --> 55:02.000
So, I'm sorry.

55:05.266 --> 55:07.466
Either way, what could have you done?

55:11.600 --> 55:12.700
Be there.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.500
I'm not joking! If you still look the same
as you did in this photo,

55:20.566 --> 55:23.600
I swear I have nothing else to wish for.

55:23.666 --> 55:26.133
Finally, this camper van has a meaning.

55:27.166 --> 55:28.100
That is?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.066
That is…

55:33.700 --> 55:37.333
Your grandfather
gave my mother this camper van.

55:37.400 --> 55:40.700
She said she always wanted
to feel at home, everyone together.

55:42.566 --> 55:43.666
Even on vacation.

55:44.266 --> 55:45.200
And so…

55:47.166 --> 55:50.733
we used to spend our vacations
in this camper van, then at some point,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
she got ill and died soon after.

55:53.733 --> 55:56.500
Your grandfather didn't want
to use it anymore.

55:59.333 --> 56:01.633
She'd be happy with what you've done.

56:02.433 --> 56:05.033
My mother would be happy with you now.

56:08.333 --> 56:09.633
So now it's up to you.

56:11.700 --> 56:14.533
Make it travel. Make this home travel.

56:19.666 --> 56:21.466
I can't just do what I want.

56:23.233 --> 56:24.433
It's easy to say.

56:25.566 --> 56:26.500
University,

56:27.300 --> 56:29.100
Seba, how can I?

56:29.166 --> 56:31.100
I can't just do whatever I want.

56:31.166 --> 56:32.266
-Yes, you can.
-No.

56:32.333 --> 56:34.233
It's your path. It's your life.

56:34.300 --> 56:37.100
You can't let
other people decide it for you.

56:37.533 --> 56:38.733
Like you did?

56:39.500 --> 56:41.000
Well, I'm not like you.

56:42.566 --> 56:43.600
Yes.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.200
You're definitely better than me.

56:51.333 --> 56:52.733
Can I take a look inside?

56:56.333 --> 56:57.333
Uncle Nik?

56:58.500 --> 56:59.500
Thank you.

57:09.633 --> 57:12.300
On this day, I was supposed to deliver
a letter to you too,

57:12.366 --> 57:14.366
which is what I'm doing.

57:19.266 --> 57:22.433
Well, you must admit
your grandfather loved surprises.

57:27.200 --> 57:29.666
After what happened, I thought…

57:32.100 --> 57:34.000
I'd managed to get over it.

57:36.433 --> 57:40.200
I've carried on with life for years,
convinced I'd been able to forget you.

57:43.133 --> 57:45.300
But all it took was seeing you again.

57:52.266 --> 57:53.200
Yeah.

57:54.666 --> 57:56.000
Well…

57:56.066 --> 57:58.633
So, you've shed your tears.

57:59.433 --> 58:03.333
You've said all you wanted to say.
Now you can stop. I mean it.

58:04.600 --> 58:06.366
If only because

58:07.600 --> 58:11.300
while you thought you'd got over me,
you married another man,

58:12.633 --> 58:14.033
which isn't a minor detail.

58:14.100 --> 58:16.600
I wanted you. I've only ever wanted you!

58:18.266 --> 58:19.266
Sure.

58:20.466 --> 58:23.733
Please, tell me
you didn't feel anything when you saw me.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.100
I felt

58:29.433 --> 58:30.500
sadness.

58:30.566 --> 58:31.666
That's not true.

58:31.733 --> 58:33.566
You can't lie, not to me.

58:33.633 --> 58:36.033
Please, Nik. It's not too late for us.

58:37.133 --> 58:39.166
Come on. Let me go.

58:59.066 --> 59:02.633
104 LIKES, 7 COMMENTS

59:02.733 --> 59:05.500
If you still have the gaze
of these pictures, I can't ask for more

59:05.566 --> 59:09.600
I don't think you exist.
Come on, nobody like that can exist…

59:22.733 --> 59:25.133
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

59:25.200 --> 59:28.133
Stop. You're making a huge racket.
That's enough.

59:28.200 --> 59:31.266
Can you believe it? It's been 20 years
and this ball looks the same.

59:31.333 --> 59:32.733
Isn't it wonderful?

59:33.000 --> 59:35.533
Well done.
I thought you'd have thrown it out.

59:35.600 --> 59:38.000
But you left it in the same closet.

59:38.066 --> 59:41.200
Listen, if this is some "remember
when we were kids" spiel, drop it.

59:41.266 --> 59:42.466
You're such a pain.

59:43.466 --> 59:47.266
Actually, tonight's
the "I'm not going to bed" night.

59:47.733 --> 59:50.766
-Do you have to wake the whole building?
-Yeah.

59:52.266 --> 59:53.766
Show me what you can do.

59:57.300 --> 59:58.400
Wow. Impressive!

1:00:01.700 --> 1:00:03.500
Close your legs!

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:06.000
-Awesome.
-So damn lucky.

1:00:06.066 --> 1:00:09.266
She's trying her usual fake out!
Same old fake out!

1:00:09.333 --> 1:00:11.700
Aiming left, turning right. He knows it!

1:00:12.666 --> 1:00:13.766
Yes!

1:00:16.333 --> 1:00:17.566
What are you doing?

1:00:18.166 --> 1:00:20.366
I've fucking had it!

1:00:20.766 --> 1:00:23.300
There are people who need
to go to work in the morning, here.

1:00:23.366 --> 1:00:26.266
-I told her that.
-Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:00:26.333 --> 1:00:29.066
Go to bed!

1:00:29.533 --> 1:00:33.066
-Te', we've fucking had it!
-Piece of shit.

1:00:33.133 --> 1:00:34.500
Last shot and we'll go.

1:00:34.566 --> 1:00:37.066
Come on, let's go. Enough, Nik.

1:00:37.133 --> 1:00:38.433
-Come on, let's go.
-Last one.

1:00:38.500 --> 1:00:39.666
Enough.

1:00:41.533 --> 1:00:42.466
Nik!

1:00:47.233 --> 1:00:50.600
-So I'll put this one here.
-No.

1:00:51.466 --> 1:00:55.566
No, wait. This goes here,
with the Romantics. You said it yourself.

1:00:55.633 --> 1:00:57.200
Oh, OK.

1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.433
-How about Bach's Cello Suite no.1?
-Yes, I included it.

1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:05.300
What about the cello?

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.433
Will you take it with you?

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:10.333
No, I don't know.

1:01:11.233 --> 1:01:15.633
Oh, God, what if they don't let me take it?
What do I do?

1:01:15.733 --> 1:01:18.033
I'll tell them I have to take it.

1:01:18.100 --> 1:01:20.500
If they don't let me,
I can't play anymore.

1:01:20.566 --> 1:01:21.766
No, calm down.

1:01:24.466 --> 1:01:27.200
Take a break. Take advantage of it. Play.

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:29.300
I'd like to hear you.

1:01:30.166 --> 1:01:31.033
No.

1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:34.633
At your age, I wouldn't go a day
without playing the piano.

1:01:36.033 --> 1:01:37.033
That's not true.

1:01:38.266 --> 1:01:41.400
Because if it was,
you would've continued playing it.

1:04:55.366 --> 1:04:57.133
I don't know how you did it.

1:04:59.733 --> 1:05:01.000
But thank you.

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:03.733
I didn't do anything.

1:05:05.733 --> 1:05:07.200
He did it all himself.

1:05:13.066 --> 1:05:15.400
It's just that I always find it moving.

1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:19.133
Because

1:05:20.033 --> 1:05:23.500
of how he manages
to express himself with the cello,

1:05:23.566 --> 1:05:25.033
to talk about himself.

1:05:26.733 --> 1:05:28.633
Even Dad loved hearing him play.

1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:30.033
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

1:05:30.100 --> 1:05:33.366
-He'd sit there, on the sofa--
-Did he grade his performance?

1:05:35.733 --> 1:05:37.566
But do you enjoy yourself?

1:05:37.633 --> 1:05:38.633
Doing what?

1:05:39.633 --> 1:05:42.133
Ruining any nice moment.
You've always done it.

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:43.600
Do you enjoy it? Tell me.

1:05:43.666 --> 1:05:45.733
-Did he grade him?
-Do you enjoy it?

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.366
It's late! It's late.

1:05:47.433 --> 1:05:50.366
We have to tell Emma.
I have to do the concert.

1:05:50.433 --> 1:05:53.200
Now I've done it with you,
I have to do it with her too.

1:05:53.266 --> 1:05:54.466
Immediately. Now.

1:05:55.066 --> 1:05:56.000
Bye.

1:06:24.166 --> 1:06:27.766
ANSWER

1:07:58.066 --> 1:08:01.333
-Nice red glasses. Can I see them?
-Sure, I'll get them.

1:08:02.633 --> 1:08:04.566
-Hi.
-Oh, hello.

1:08:05.566 --> 1:08:08.466
These days I only see you
when you come home to sleep.

1:08:10.033 --> 1:08:13.466
Well, I think you know very well
where you can find me.

1:08:14.066 --> 1:08:17.000
I'm at your place every day
practicing with your brother.

1:08:17.066 --> 1:08:19.633
He played with Nik.
He decided to do the concert.

1:08:19.700 --> 1:08:23.133
-It's really important for him.
-Excuse me, do you have this in a small?

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:25.100
Yes, I'll get it for you.

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:28.700
Listen, Emma, I spent ten years of my life
neglecting myself for him.

1:08:28.766 --> 1:08:30.433
Not only does he not look for me,

1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:34.500
but an asshole with a kiteboard shows up
and suddenly he's doing a concert?

1:08:36.766 --> 1:08:37.766
You're right.

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.733
Seba has changed a lot since Nik arrived.
But not because he's a wizard.

1:08:43.399 --> 1:08:46.200
I changed, too,
when I found out about the disease.

1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:49.566
I'm overprotective.
I watch every word I say to him.

1:08:50.166 --> 1:08:52.233
Do you realize that, unlike Nik,

1:08:52.300 --> 1:08:54.500
we remind him that he's ill every day?

1:08:55.233 --> 1:08:57.399
Don't worry if you don't have it.

1:08:57.466 --> 1:09:00.200
-Listen, Emma…
-I'll let you go.

1:09:02.266 --> 1:09:03.266
Bye.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.399
Here they are. Sorry.

1:09:08.133 --> 1:09:10.033
-An S, right?
-Yes, please.

1:09:10.100 --> 1:09:11.100
I'll go get it.

1:09:16.066 --> 1:09:18.066
Ambra's tits aren't this big.

1:09:23.133 --> 1:09:27.233
Don't worry, Seba was in his room
all afternoon. He didn't notice anything.

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.066
Can't you see how pathetic you are?

1:09:31.633 --> 1:09:33.166
You're fifty, Nik.

1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:39.233
Get a life. But do it far from here.

1:09:39.300 --> 1:09:40.200
Yeah?

1:09:40.266 --> 1:09:42.133
You're telling me to get a life?

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:44.733
You

1:09:45.300 --> 1:09:47.633
who have been living for…
How long, 20 years?

1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.733
With a nice pair of blinkers on.
What life is that?

1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:53.533
That's the life of a horse.

1:09:54.266 --> 1:09:58.166
Actually, I was waiting
for the surfer philosopher to teach me.

1:09:58.566 --> 1:10:00.366
The man who has no family,

1:10:00.433 --> 1:10:04.566
who's done fuck-all, is gonna reveal
the recipe for happiness to me?

1:10:05.533 --> 1:10:06.466
Yeah.

1:10:07.533 --> 1:10:09.666
Accompanied by a nice glass of wine.

1:10:09.733 --> 1:10:12.166
And remember that one is never enough.

1:10:16.166 --> 1:10:17.400
Isn't that how it is?

1:10:18.233 --> 1:10:19.166
Fuck you.

1:10:19.233 --> 1:10:24.066
Instead of always looking in front of you,
judging everyone, look inside yourself.

1:10:24.133 --> 1:10:25.000
Fuck you.

1:10:25.066 --> 1:10:28.733
Have you realized
Carolina never shows up anymore? No.

1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:32.766
Because you're so stubborn
about keeping everything under control,

1:10:33.033 --> 1:10:36.700
you convince yourself everything's fine,
a lie here, a lie there.

1:10:36.766 --> 1:10:39.166
That's what you do. Just to trudge on.

1:10:40.266 --> 1:10:42.000
-You're judging me as a mother?
-Yes.

1:10:42.066 --> 1:10:43.500
You cowardly bastard!

1:10:45.166 --> 1:10:49.533
You, who ran away without giving a damn
about anyone or anything for a kiteboard?

1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:53.166
How can you really think I left
for a fucking kiteboard?

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:56.300
Did it ever cross your mind,
in all these years,

1:10:56.366 --> 1:10:58.400
that I was the one to suffer the most?

1:10:58.466 --> 1:11:01.500
To have to give up everyone, everything!
Even give you up!

1:11:01.566 --> 1:11:03.433
So why did you leave, then?

1:11:04.166 --> 1:11:07.133
Why did you do it? Why did you leave? Why?

1:11:07.666 --> 1:11:11.000
Why did you abandon me?
You left me alone. Why?

1:11:11.066 --> 1:11:13.533
Because I found my future wife
in bed with another man!

1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:15.566
What the fuck are you talking about?

1:11:16.200 --> 1:11:17.533
And it wasn't a one-off.

1:11:18.400 --> 1:11:20.366
The affair had been going on for a while.

1:11:20.433 --> 1:11:23.466
That's not true. It's impossible.
Giada and I were friends.

1:11:23.533 --> 1:11:25.733
She would've told me. I don't believe you.

1:11:29.766 --> 1:11:32.633
It's not true,
because you believe in this? Right?

1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:35.000
-You believe in this?
-Stop it.

1:11:35.066 --> 1:11:38.166
-Is this the truth? Where the fuck is it?
-Stop it!

1:11:38.233 --> 1:11:40.100
Come on, show me the truth.

1:11:40.166 --> 1:11:42.166
Come on, where is the truth?

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:45.566
Oh, God.

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:47.200
I'm sorry.

1:11:48.766 --> 1:11:51.433
-Let me go!
-No. I'm sorry.

1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:55.633
I'm sorry. Please. I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1:11:57.433 --> 1:11:59.433
Sorry.

1:12:00.066 --> 1:12:01.500
Please, calm down.

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:05.733
-Please.
-Nik.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.466
Please. I'm sorry. Forgive me, I'm sorry.

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:13.633
I love you. I'm sorry.

1:12:16.533 --> 1:12:18.033
Breathe.

1:12:18.700 --> 1:12:20.500
It's all right.

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:40.333
The medicine?

1:12:41.200 --> 1:12:44.700
-Have you seen the medicine, Nik?
-I took them. They're here.

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:47.700
-This?
-Yes.

1:12:49.666 --> 1:12:53.166
-Remember, the blue one before lunch--
-And the white one after.

1:12:53.233 --> 1:12:55.300
I've been here a while. I know.

1:12:56.066 --> 1:12:59.166
-If you're worried, let's forget about it.
-No.

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:02.066
I'm not worried.

1:13:02.133 --> 1:13:04.766
Sebastiano hasn't spent
a day at the beach in ages.

1:13:05.366 --> 1:13:08.700
Then tomorrow there's the concert.
It's normal for me to be a bit tense.

1:13:11.066 --> 1:13:14.566
He's the one who suggested it, not me.
"Do all the checks."

1:13:16.366 --> 1:13:17.300
Thank you.

1:13:19.666 --> 1:13:24.300
By the way, today is my day off,
so I'd be happy just to go by myself.

1:13:24.733 --> 1:13:26.400
No, it's OK.

1:13:26.466 --> 1:13:28.633
Sebastiano would be too disappointed.

1:13:28.700 --> 1:13:29.633
It's OK.

1:13:40.133 --> 1:13:43.500
-Why didn't you tell me about Giada?
-OK, I'm ready. Shall we go?

1:13:44.100 --> 1:13:45.166
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1:13:45.233 --> 1:13:46.166
Yeah.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:51.300
-Did you get a towel?
-No.

1:13:51.366 --> 1:13:52.600
Yes, I got it.

1:14:12.100 --> 1:14:14.433
I told you yes. Enough. Leave me alone.

1:14:15.533 --> 1:14:18.466
Trust me. I made up my mind.
Enough. Over and out.

1:14:19.066 --> 1:14:20.100
Over and out.

1:14:22.366 --> 1:14:24.033
-Everything OK?
-Yes.

1:14:25.466 --> 1:14:26.733
Yes, everything's OK.

1:14:31.766 --> 1:14:36.000
Kelvin. I told you I made up my mind.
Enough. I know what I'm doing.

1:14:36.066 --> 1:14:38.166
Trust me, Kelvin. Trust me.

1:14:38.233 --> 1:14:39.166
Trust me.

1:14:40.300 --> 1:14:41.266
Want me to stop?

1:14:41.333 --> 1:14:44.333
No. If I tell you something,
do you swear you won't tell anyone?

1:14:45.100 --> 1:14:46.100
Yes, I swear.

1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:54.066
I'm not going to Mars out of choice.
I'm going because I'm a chosen one.

1:14:54.133 --> 1:14:55.533
Oh, I see.

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.766
Nobody knows,
but every day I talk to Kelvin,

1:15:03.033 --> 1:15:05.033
who was born on Mars.

1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:09.166
He was the one who assigned me the task
of taking classical music up there.

1:15:09.233 --> 1:15:10.166
Yeah?

1:15:10.733 --> 1:15:14.533
I mean, every now and then,
I've had the feeling that…

1:15:17.266 --> 1:15:19.266
that you were talking to someone.

1:15:20.700 --> 1:15:21.666
Really?

1:15:21.733 --> 1:15:24.100
-Yes.
-You really had the feel--

1:15:26.466 --> 1:15:28.666
-Sometimes.
-But you can't tell anyone.

1:15:28.733 --> 1:15:31.500
Stop it. You can't tell anyone.
Because if you do…

1:15:31.566 --> 1:15:34.700
If you tell Mom, there'll be a huge drama.

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.200
And she won't let me go to Mars.
I have to go to Mars. Understand?

1:15:38.266 --> 1:15:39.533
-Yes.
-You can't tell anyone.

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:42.633
-I told you because I trust you.
-Yes.

1:15:42.700 --> 1:15:43.666
Understand?

1:15:43.733 --> 1:15:46.333
-Swear you won't tell anyone.
-I swear.

1:15:46.400 --> 1:15:49.566
Nobody knows.
You have to swear you won't tell anyone.

1:15:49.633 --> 1:15:50.633
I swear.

1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:53.400
Stop it. He swore. Swear.

1:15:54.066 --> 1:15:55.166
Swear you won't tell.

1:15:57.466 --> 1:15:58.466
I swear.

1:15:59.733 --> 1:16:00.666
Come on.

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:05.233
OK, now I'm not so worried, then.

1:16:18.133 --> 1:16:19.200
Hello?

1:16:19.266 --> 1:16:20.633
How are you, sweetheart?

1:16:20.700 --> 1:16:22.200
Hi. Good. You?

1:16:22.266 --> 1:16:23.433
Good. Listen.

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:27.300
Want to come to the beach with me?

1:16:27.366 --> 1:16:31.233
God, Tesla. No. I won't go with you.
Because if you go, you'll fuck up.

1:16:31.300 --> 1:16:35.533
I know.
Look, you're right. But I'm worried.

1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:38.666
No shit.
You've been worried your whole life.

1:16:38.733 --> 1:16:40.600
Anyway, I've got things to do.

1:16:40.666 --> 1:16:42.433
No, wait. Wait a second.

1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:43.433
What?

1:16:44.233 --> 1:16:48.200
I want to listen to you.
I want to stop letting anxiety rule me.

1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:50.533
Well done.

1:16:51.333 --> 1:16:52.733
You've finally got it.

1:16:53.466 --> 1:16:57.400
You can even relax for one day
in your life. Nothing will happen.

1:16:57.466 --> 1:16:59.333
Yes, OK.

1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:00.400
I'm in.

1:17:01.133 --> 1:17:02.000
But,

1:17:02.066 --> 1:17:05.633
but how long has it been
since we've spent a whole day together?

1:17:06.366 --> 1:17:07.333
Like, forever?

1:17:08.166 --> 1:17:09.433
Let go, very slowly,

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:13.566
and start drawing a figure eight
to lift your ass out of the water.

1:17:13.633 --> 1:17:14.533
-Yes.
-Got it?

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:15.500
Yes.

1:17:15.566 --> 1:17:17.000
See? It's like

1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:19.733
like a dance.

1:17:20.333 --> 1:17:22.066
Like dancing with the wind.

1:17:23.200 --> 1:17:24.766
You see? Look.

1:17:25.433 --> 1:17:27.266
Draw a figure eight.

1:17:27.733 --> 1:17:30.433
-What is an eight? What sign?
-Infinity sign.

1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:31.566
Come here. Try it.

1:17:33.633 --> 1:17:35.333
It's beautiful!

1:17:37.033 --> 1:17:38.200
Darling.

1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:40.200
It's beautiful!

1:17:41.266 --> 1:17:42.400
Look at it.

1:17:43.066 --> 1:17:44.233
How did you do it?

1:17:45.233 --> 1:17:49.066
I used the money I had put aside
from the last few months' sales.

1:17:49.133 --> 1:17:50.766
No, that's not what I mean.

1:17:52.066 --> 1:17:54.566
It's a wicked idea, Carolina.
It's beautiful.

1:17:54.633 --> 1:17:55.700
-Can I go in?
-Yes.

1:17:57.533 --> 1:18:01.433
Wow! Look what you've done here.
You're a genius, my darling!

1:18:01.500 --> 1:18:03.033
You're a genius, you know?

1:18:03.566 --> 1:18:04.500
This?

1:18:09.566 --> 1:18:11.300
So, shall we go for a swim?

1:18:11.366 --> 1:18:12.533
No, I'm scared.

1:18:12.600 --> 1:18:15.133
I'm scared of swimming. I'm a bit scared.

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:17.366
You go, though.

1:18:17.433 --> 1:18:19.400
I'll stay here. I'll watch you.

1:18:20.366 --> 1:18:22.266
I'll watch you kitesurfing. Go on.

1:18:22.333 --> 1:18:23.700
Put on Fauré.

1:18:24.433 --> 1:18:26.633
-Remember to put on Fauré.
-OK, I will.

1:18:27.700 --> 1:18:30.400
-Listen, let's do something else.
-No, no.

1:18:31.266 --> 1:18:33.100
-Go on.
-Are you sure?

1:18:33.166 --> 1:18:34.200
Yes, go on.

1:18:37.233 --> 1:18:38.300
All right. Bye.

1:18:43.200 --> 1:18:44.200
Ready?

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.166
I know the water's clear.
I can't go. I'm scared.

1:18:52.233 --> 1:18:55.133
I told you. I'm scared.
Leave me alone. I'm scared.

1:18:55.566 --> 1:18:57.033
I'm scared.

1:19:00.700 --> 1:19:01.633
Sorry.

1:19:03.333 --> 1:19:05.466
I said sorry. Did you hear me?

1:19:07.033 --> 1:19:08.000
Whatever…

1:19:58.666 --> 1:20:01.533
I've missed
so many important things in my life.

1:20:02.333 --> 1:20:04.633
Who knows how many more
I'm missing with you?

1:20:05.466 --> 1:20:07.633
Yeah. Want to know another?

1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:10.733
I'm quitting university.

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:28.233
I told a guy I liked I was an only child.

1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:33.200
I did it
because I was scared of losing him.

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:38.500
You know when I tell you

1:20:38.566 --> 1:20:41.466
that my father hasn't forgotten me
and calls me often?

1:20:42.466 --> 1:20:43.400
It's bullshit.

1:20:44.366 --> 1:20:46.300
He doesn't even answer my texts.

1:20:48.033 --> 1:20:49.066
Want me to go on?

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:57.333
I'm chatting with a stranger.

1:21:00.766 --> 1:21:02.566
Flirting, to be more precise.

1:21:02.633 --> 1:21:04.033
Mom!

1:21:06.033 --> 1:21:07.300
You called me Mom!

1:21:08.100 --> 1:21:10.366
-Yes.
-You called me Mom.

1:21:12.666 --> 1:21:13.700
We're here.

1:21:17.233 --> 1:21:18.666
Are you sure it's legal?

1:21:19.266 --> 1:21:22.533
Of course!
Of course, it's legal. Perfectly legal.

1:21:25.266 --> 1:21:26.466
Because it's working.

1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:29.266
-Because you're not used to it.
-No.

1:21:29.333 --> 1:21:30.266
No.

1:21:30.666 --> 1:21:33.133
Everything seems to be fine, anyway.

1:21:35.333 --> 1:21:36.600
Your brother isn't so bad.

1:21:38.100 --> 1:21:39.233
He's even updating you.

1:21:44.633 --> 1:21:45.700
There, done.

1:21:46.400 --> 1:21:47.333
What's done?

1:21:47.766 --> 1:21:49.666
You have a date here in half an hour.

1:21:50.500 --> 1:21:52.566
What? No, you're kidding.

1:21:52.633 --> 1:21:55.066
-Come on, Mom. Give it to me.
-Carolina.

1:21:55.133 --> 1:21:58.433
Mom, every day
he writes wonderful things to you,

1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:01.366
he's divorced,
and he doesn't seem like a serial killer.

1:22:02.266 --> 1:22:04.133
Aren't you a tiny bit curious?

1:22:05.366 --> 1:22:07.166
-Yes, a little.
-There you go.

1:22:07.633 --> 1:22:09.466
Let's go. I'll take care of you.

1:22:10.333 --> 1:22:11.266
Get up.

1:22:11.733 --> 1:22:13.333
Come on. I already have an idea.

1:22:15.366 --> 1:22:18.266
-Come on. Get a move on.
-Yeah. Hang on.

1:22:18.333 --> 1:22:19.500
Thank you.

1:22:22.033 --> 1:22:26.500
-Isn't it a bit too tight, Carolina?
-No, it's perfect. It suits you.

1:22:30.033 --> 1:22:32.700
I don't know. And these heels are so high.

1:22:32.766 --> 1:22:34.766
Do you think that could be him?

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:39.533
Yes, that's him.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:41.600
He's not bad!

1:22:43.433 --> 1:22:45.500
What are you waiting for? Go join him.

1:22:48.033 --> 1:22:49.266
Let's drop it.

1:22:49.700 --> 1:22:51.633
I'll tell him something came up.

1:22:51.700 --> 1:22:53.200
Why? You're here.

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:57.133
-And I've smoked.
-So what?

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:02.266
I haven't spent
a whole day with you in ages.

1:23:02.666 --> 1:23:04.233
I don't want it to end.

1:23:05.266 --> 1:23:06.200
Why not?

1:23:07.466 --> 1:23:08.633
It's just the first.

1:23:10.433 --> 1:23:11.733
Of many more.

1:23:12.733 --> 1:23:14.300
Go on. You can do it.

1:23:20.566 --> 1:23:21.566
How do I look?

1:23:22.600 --> 1:23:24.733
Like someone who hasn't had fun in ages.

1:23:26.766 --> 1:23:28.466
You look beautiful.

1:23:29.133 --> 1:23:30.266
Go on.

1:23:30.333 --> 1:23:31.466
Don't go overboard.

1:23:31.533 --> 1:23:33.533
-No.
-Easy.

1:23:37.333 --> 1:23:38.333
Thank you.

1:23:39.333 --> 1:23:40.633
-Your bag.
-Right.

1:23:42.333 --> 1:23:43.266
Thank you.

1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:01.400
The sunset is over. Can we go, please?

1:25:02.433 --> 1:25:04.766
-I'll finish my drink and we'll go.
-I want to go now.

1:25:05.033 --> 1:25:06.500
Can we go home? Please.

1:25:07.566 --> 1:25:10.100
-Sorry, before going--
-Please, can we go home?

1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:11.700
-Please.
-Yes.

1:25:11.766 --> 1:25:14.066
-Look, a--
-No, I want to go now.

1:25:14.133 --> 1:25:17.466
Wait a second, I'll be right back.
I have a surprise for you.

1:25:18.366 --> 1:25:19.300
Hey.

1:25:20.266 --> 1:25:21.200
Hey.

1:25:27.233 --> 1:25:29.766
-It was a lovely day.
-What did you do?

1:25:30.633 --> 1:25:33.600
I went kitesurfing, and he…

1:25:33.666 --> 1:25:35.666
But that's… that's Emma.

1:25:36.333 --> 1:25:38.733
No, it's not possible. That's Emma.

1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:48.500
Where's he going?

1:25:49.300 --> 1:25:51.166
Wait here. I'll handle it.

1:25:53.333 --> 1:25:54.333
Seba.

1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:58.266
-No, Kelvin. Kelvin, you knew it.
-Seba.

1:25:58.333 --> 1:26:00.033
-You knew it.
-Hey.

1:26:00.100 --> 1:26:02.033
-Where are you going?
-You knew it.

1:26:02.100 --> 1:26:05.233
-Seba, stop. What's wrong?
-You knew it.

1:26:05.300 --> 1:26:08.000
-Why are you crying?
-Don't touch me!

1:26:08.066 --> 1:26:10.033
You mustn't touch me!

1:26:10.100 --> 1:26:12.033
-You mustn't touch me.
-No, but--

1:26:12.100 --> 1:26:13.400
Don't touch me.

1:26:14.700 --> 1:26:18.433
You knew it!
The mission! Kelvin warned me!

1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:20.500
He warned me you'd betray me!

1:26:20.566 --> 1:26:23.700
Why did you betray me?
Why did you betray me?

1:26:23.766 --> 1:26:26.033
You brought Emma.
Why did you come to the beach?

1:26:26.100 --> 1:26:29.066
You wanted to be with Emma.
Emma's mine! Got it? Emma's mine!

1:26:29.133 --> 1:26:32.133
She's mine! Emma's mine! She loves me!

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:34.333
Don't touch me! She loves me!

1:26:35.033 --> 1:26:36.300
She's mine!

1:26:36.366 --> 1:26:37.666
Take me home!

1:26:37.733 --> 1:26:39.366
I want to go home!

1:26:39.433 --> 1:26:41.366
I want to go home!

1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:45.133
Go away! Go away!

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:46.566
Take me home!

1:26:46.633 --> 1:26:48.233
I want to go home.

1:26:49.133 --> 1:26:52.033
Don't touch me! I want to go home!

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:12.433
How is he?

1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:15.200
-Better. He's better. He's sleeping.
-He's better.

1:27:15.266 --> 1:27:16.600
Now he's worried!

1:27:16.666 --> 1:27:18.666
Do you realize what could've happened?

1:27:18.733 --> 1:27:22.066
-If he'd had a chance to hurt himself.
-Luckily, nothing did happen.

1:27:22.133 --> 1:27:24.633
-OK? Nothing happened.
-Tesla. I didn't know.

1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:28.000
You think all it takes
is a couple of jokes, a bit of empathy.

1:27:28.066 --> 1:27:30.666
You're just irresponsible.
You're reckless, superficial.

1:27:30.733 --> 1:27:32.200
Yes, you're superficial.

1:27:32.266 --> 1:27:36.000
I won't let you again. I won't let you.

1:27:36.066 --> 1:27:38.066
I won't let my son pay the price.

1:27:38.133 --> 1:27:40.533
-I won't let it.
-Enough. Mom, you're overreacting. OK?

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:43.333
-I'm not overreacting.
-Yes, you are. Listen to me.

1:27:43.400 --> 1:27:45.166
But didn't it occur to you,

1:27:45.233 --> 1:27:49.000
when he told you about the voice,
didn't you think you should take him home?

1:27:49.066 --> 1:27:50.666
-No.
-To come and tell me immediately?

1:27:50.733 --> 1:27:51.600
-No.
-No?

1:27:51.666 --> 1:27:54.066
He made me promise I wouldn't tell.
I didn't know.

1:27:54.133 --> 1:27:58.266
-You don't know a fucking thing!
-Seba wanted to do something normal today.

1:27:58.333 --> 1:28:01.300
-OK? A day at the beach with his uncle.
-Yes.

1:28:02.133 --> 1:28:03.666
Did you see what happened?

1:28:04.333 --> 1:28:06.666
-I shouldn't have allowed it.
-What are you saying?

1:28:06.733 --> 1:28:09.133
You know we can't protect him forever?

1:28:09.200 --> 1:28:12.366
-It could've happened to me or you.
-It didn't happen to me or you.

1:28:12.433 --> 1:28:14.033
It happened to him!

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:20.766
I'm going to see how he is.

1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:32.666
CALLING…

1:29:45.433 --> 1:29:49.333
So I still have time
to make you change your mind and stay.

1:29:50.266 --> 1:29:51.400
No.

1:29:51.466 --> 1:29:53.200
I'm leaving tomorrow.

1:29:54.633 --> 1:29:56.633
-What do you mean tomorrow?
-Yes, tomorrow.

1:29:57.233 --> 1:29:58.166
Why then?

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:02.200
Because you're coming with me.
Leave your husband and let's go.

1:30:02.266 --> 1:30:05.033
-Come on, don't joke, Nik.
-I'm not joking.

1:30:06.433 --> 1:30:09.200
You're the one
who said it wasn't too late.

1:30:16.033 --> 1:30:19.066
Oh, God, Nik. We up
and leave everything, just like that?

1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:21.766
Sorry, but for you too, if you leave now--

1:30:22.033 --> 1:30:24.466
I don't give a damn
about my father's money.

1:30:24.533 --> 1:30:26.366
Even less about his inheritance.

1:30:27.233 --> 1:30:28.300
Let's start again.

1:30:29.266 --> 1:30:30.200
Yes.

1:30:30.666 --> 1:30:32.566
-From scratch?
-From scratch.

1:30:33.466 --> 1:30:34.566
From the beginning.

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:38.133
Giada.

1:30:39.033 --> 1:30:41.466
Giada. What's the problem, sorry?

1:30:43.266 --> 1:30:44.666
What are you offering me?

1:30:46.566 --> 1:30:47.566
What?

1:30:50.500 --> 1:30:52.266
Wasn't I the life you wanted?

1:30:53.500 --> 1:30:56.600
A life around the world with a kiteboard?
Is that it?

1:30:59.733 --> 1:31:00.666
Now.

1:31:08.566 --> 1:31:09.700
Yes, now. Yes.

1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:17.200
So why all this? What was the point?

1:31:17.633 --> 1:31:20.433
-To get your stupid revenge?
-No.

1:31:20.500 --> 1:31:21.700
To finally realize

1:31:21.766 --> 1:31:24.666
that losing you was the best thing
that could've happened to me.

1:31:27.100 --> 1:31:28.733
You're a bastard, Nik.

1:31:57.133 --> 1:31:58.566
What are you doing?

1:31:59.433 --> 1:32:00.700
What needs to be done.

1:32:04.466 --> 1:32:07.333
Listen, I'm sorry.
I'm not very good at goodbyes.

1:32:26.333 --> 1:32:27.266
Here.

1:32:27.333 --> 1:32:28.333
What is it?

1:32:29.066 --> 1:32:30.133
Your inheritance.

1:32:30.700 --> 1:32:32.266
The money you're due.

1:32:35.200 --> 1:32:38.166
Oh yes.
Grandpa didn't only write to you two.

1:32:38.700 --> 1:32:41.200
He appointed me
to give it to you ahead of time

1:32:41.266 --> 1:32:42.766
if things were going badly.

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:50.366
So what was the point
of this whole charade, then?

1:32:53.033 --> 1:32:56.500
Well, this "charade" allowed you
to get to know your family.

1:32:57.466 --> 1:32:58.333
Yeah.

1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:01.000
If you'd got it right away,
that wouldn't have happened.

1:33:02.133 --> 1:33:03.333
And what's changed?

1:33:07.500 --> 1:33:10.000
Well, what can I tell you, in that case?

1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:13.100
Good luck.

1:33:17.666 --> 1:33:20.500
It'll be a blow to Sebastiano
not to see you here, you know?

1:33:22.166 --> 1:33:25.233
No, I don't believe that.
I was just another problem.

1:33:26.166 --> 1:33:28.500
No, and that's not what Grandpa thought.

1:33:29.100 --> 1:33:32.100
His letter told me how much
he messed up with you.

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:34.700
Yes? That's what I thought too.

1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:39.566
In the end,
I seriously think he saved my life.

1:33:45.633 --> 1:33:47.100
Let me go.

1:34:30.700 --> 1:34:32.300
SCHIZOPHRENIA

1:34:37.633 --> 1:34:40.666
DEAR NIKOLA, MY SON

1:35:08.466 --> 1:35:11.400
I'VE DECIDED TO MOVE TO MARS
BECAUSE, AS MY GRANDPA ALWAYS SAID,

1:35:11.466 --> 1:35:13.666
LIFE WITHOUT MUSIC
IS LIKE A FAMILY WITHOUT LOVE.

1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.666
Good evening. Where are we going?

1:35:34.433 --> 1:35:35.466
Everything OK?

1:35:38.133 --> 1:35:39.066
Yes.

1:35:40.666 --> 1:35:44.600
-He's a bit nervous, but that's normal.
-At home, he was really nervous.

1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:48.033
Are you sure that
after everything that happened yesterday…

1:35:48.700 --> 1:35:50.000
He insisted.

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.233
He thinks
he has to play for the last time.

1:35:53.300 --> 1:35:56.233
-What could I do, lock him in his room?
-No, of course not.

1:36:44.466 --> 1:36:45.433
Seba.

1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:47.533
Seba.

1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:45.733
No!

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000
Oh my God!

1:37:48.300 --> 1:37:49.400
Sebastiano!

1:37:49.466 --> 1:37:50.733
Oh my God!

1:37:51.733 --> 1:37:52.766
No!

1:37:53.766 --> 1:37:56.333
Sweetheart.

1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:57.500
Oh my God!

1:37:58.366 --> 1:37:59.433
Carolina!

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:23.733
Nik…

1:38:25.066 --> 1:38:26.133
Nik…

1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:29.033
No…

1:38:49.100 --> 1:38:50.333
DAD

1:38:59.166 --> 1:39:00.400
It's all my fault.

1:39:00.466 --> 1:39:02.466
I shouldn't have allowed it.

1:39:03.733 --> 1:39:05.266
I should have known.

1:39:06.066 --> 1:39:08.333
-No, it's not your fault. Stop it.
-Yes.

1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:11.700
-Come on, stop it.
-It is, though.

1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:16.633
I got it all wrong,

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:20.233
and now my son might die
because I didn't think about it.

1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:22.666
What use is torturing yourself?

1:39:25.733 --> 1:39:29.533
What's the point? It won't help you.
It won't help Sebastiano. Stop it.

1:39:37.033 --> 1:39:38.766
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

1:39:43.533 --> 1:39:44.700
I read your letter.

1:39:46.366 --> 1:39:47.333
Yeah?

1:39:56.533 --> 1:39:59.200
I thought
we'd never see each other again. Sorry.

1:40:04.400 --> 1:40:08.600
How did you manage
to keep it all bottled up for so long?

1:40:11.300 --> 1:40:12.600
Why didn't you tell me?

1:40:16.433 --> 1:40:19.433
Why did you let me hate you for 20 years?
Why, Nik?

1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:21.300
It was better that way.

1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:25.033
Because,

1:40:26.033 --> 1:40:29.000
you didn't need to pay too.

1:40:32.700 --> 1:40:35.600
I'd have taken your father away, too,
and I didn't want to.

1:40:35.666 --> 1:40:37.633
So you took my brother away?

1:40:40.633 --> 1:40:43.233
Fuck, Nik. Dad was sleeping with Giada.

1:40:48.266 --> 1:40:49.533
God. What…

1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:51.700
If only I'd known.

1:40:53.033 --> 1:40:54.333
You'd have hated him.

1:40:55.133 --> 1:40:56.666
All three of us would've suffered.

1:40:58.266 --> 1:40:59.633
Instead of only one.

1:41:02.600 --> 1:41:03.566
And also…

1:41:08.033 --> 1:41:09.333
I was ashamed.

1:41:16.433 --> 1:41:17.633
I have missed you so much.

1:41:23.033 --> 1:41:24.100
I have missed you so much.

1:41:24.166 --> 1:41:25.700
So much.

1:41:30.533 --> 1:41:31.766
I've missed you too.

1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:49.100
He's waking up.

1:43:13.166 --> 1:43:16.100
No, wait.
Wait, honey, that's dangerous. No!

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:32.133
I'm fine. I don't know
how it happened, but I'm fine.

1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:40.133
Well? What's with the long faces?

1:43:41.166 --> 1:43:43.466
You should be happy to see me like this.

1:43:46.533 --> 1:43:47.533
Especially you…

1:43:50.033 --> 1:43:52.266
who sacrificed your whole life for me.

1:43:54.666 --> 1:43:56.200
But that's enough now.

1:43:59.400 --> 1:44:01.066
Enough. Enough.

1:44:02.633 --> 1:44:04.233
Start living again, Mom.

1:44:06.066 --> 1:44:07.733
You're not alone anymore, Mom.

1:44:12.766 --> 1:44:13.766
Do it for me.

1:44:15.666 --> 1:44:17.233
Actually, no, do it for you.

1:44:27.266 --> 1:44:29.200
There's no need to talk to you.

1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:33.233
Not because I don't understand

1:44:35.566 --> 1:44:37.133
but because we're siblings.

1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:39.600
And what one feels, the other feels too.

1:44:41.366 --> 1:44:42.633
Let it all go.

1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:48.300
Choose your path,
go, and don't ever turn back.

1:44:51.466 --> 1:44:53.433
Knowing you're happy is enough for us.

1:45:00.700 --> 1:45:02.366
You are a beautiful soul.

1:45:03.433 --> 1:45:04.466
You're special.

1:45:07.666 --> 1:45:10.233
That's why I thought you could love me.

1:45:12.300 --> 1:45:14.166
Even if it was all in my head.

1:45:18.733 --> 1:45:20.000
Like the mission.

1:45:21.433 --> 1:45:23.300
I'm never going to Mars.

1:45:26.433 --> 1:45:29.533
And Kelvin,
you know he doesn't exist, right?

1:45:34.166 --> 1:45:36.100
Did you really want to run away?

1:45:38.300 --> 1:45:39.300
To go where?

1:45:41.566 --> 1:45:44.066
This is your family. This is your home.

1:45:47.266 --> 1:45:51.200
And it's weird, imperfect, and fragile,
but it's yours.

1:45:52.700 --> 1:45:53.633
Stop.

1:45:55.400 --> 1:45:56.333
Breathe.

1:45:58.200 --> 1:45:59.200
And forgive.

1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:14.300
From here,
it's easy to find the right words.

1:46:16.566 --> 1:46:19.466
I don't know
if these words are mine or yours.

1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:24.633
In reality,
I don't know if or where I'll wake up.

1:46:25.700 --> 1:46:27.166
But it doesn't matter.

1:46:29.766 --> 1:46:31.133
I'm happy now.

1:46:36.066 --> 1:46:37.166
And that's OK.
