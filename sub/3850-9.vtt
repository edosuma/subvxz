WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:01.270
I can't do this anymore.

00:01.270 --> 00:03.279
And I'm worried the longer we stay  in this,

00:03.279 --> 00:04.860
whatever this is,

00:04.860 --> 00:06.559
everything we have may fall apart.

00:06.820 --> 00:07.620
Karen.

00:07.960 --> 00:08.619
He's right.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.429
Previously on "Mistresses"...

00:11.699 --> 00:13.519
Lucy, your mother is talking.

00:13.519 --> 00:14.890
Put the phone away.

00:17.039 --> 00:17.989
You don't reach.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.030
You ask.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.620
I had to use your apartment to get laid.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.629
I mean, that's the basic definition of loser.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.050
I mean, the point is, why would April ever go for a guy like me?

00:26.129 --> 00:28.129
You're being way too hard on yourself here, mate.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.940
Just relax. Have a beer.

00:34.130 --> 00:36.310
We're being investigated for murder now.

00:36.390 --> 00:38.500
- But maybe if you just tell the truth... - Are you crazy?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.000
You refusing to tell the truth

00:40.000 --> 00:41.200
makes me look like I'm lying.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.899
I am not going down for this

00:43.030 --> 00:45.399
because you're too stupid to keep your mouth shut.

00:45.850 --> 00:47.729
Calista was a part of the plan the whole time.

00:47.820 --> 00:49.170
Part of the plan to kill Luca?

00:49.170 --> 00:49.850
What?

00:50.500 --> 00:51.490
No. I --

00:51.490 --> 00:52.570
What was the plan, then?

00:53.119 --> 00:56.539
Okay, I-I-I think I-I want a lawyer present.

00:58.280 --> 01:00.280
So, you know, I mean, it is -- it's L.A., right?

01:00.280 --> 01:01.350
You run into, I don't know,

01:01.350 --> 01:03.090
Neil Patrick Harris in line for coffee,

01:03.090 --> 01:04.569
Patricia Arquette's at Sugarfish,

01:04.569 --> 01:07.390
and then Calista freakin' Raines steals your parking spot.

01:07.640 --> 01:09.920
God, I love Patricia Arquette.

01:10.010 --> 01:10.560
And -- and, you know what?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.780
I thought that it was just a happy coincidence or something,

01:12.780 --> 01:15.000
especially when we became such good friends, you know?

01:15.000 --> 01:16.560
But now, all of a sudden, I'm wondering,

01:17.289 --> 01:19.210
"What if she was targeting me all along?"

01:19.280 --> 01:21.840
Maybe she thought that I was an easy mark, right?

01:21.879 --> 01:24.450
I think we should focus on what we know for sure.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.269
Well, it sounds like we can't be too sure

01:26.269 --> 01:28.989
about anything when it comes to this Clarissa person.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.799
-It's Calista. - Sorry?

01:31.150 --> 01:33.049
Calista Raines.

01:33.049 --> 01:33.900
Oh, right, right.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.090
And instead of speculating about her,

01:36.090 --> 01:37.439
perhaps we need to discuss

01:37.439 --> 01:39.609
what we do right now, the next steps.

01:40.780 --> 01:41.469
Legally.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.109
Of course.

01:42.259 --> 01:45.099
The first thing we would do is drop a contract for services.

01:45.099 --> 01:46.840
I can talk to you about my fee schedule,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.250
which is very reasonable.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.069
I think we'll need to discuss everything

01:50.069 --> 01:52.049
before we do anything official.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.299
Can we get back to you?

01:55.599 --> 01:56.659
Uh, okay.

01:56.659 --> 01:59.379
I'll just -- I'll leave this information here with you.

02:03.219 --> 02:04.719
Thank you. We'll be in touch.

02:04.719 --> 02:06.049
Okay. You've got my cell.

02:06.049 --> 02:06.609
Yes.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.360
Thanks.

02:15.419 --> 02:16.729
Do you believe that guy?

02:16.729 --> 02:18.629
What? He -- he wasn't so bad.

02:18.629 --> 02:19.770
He was a mess!

02:20.520 --> 02:21.960
And honestly, so were you.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.189
Uh, what is that supposed to mean?

02:25.189 --> 02:26.939
It means we need to find you a better lawyer.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.990
But you need to be a better client, too.

02:29.259 --> 02:31.539
No more crazy talk about Calista stalking you.

02:31.539 --> 02:33.009
Okay, it's just one theory.

02:33.199 --> 02:35.199
And I'm so sorry that I'm not sounding rational right now,

02:35.199 --> 02:36.770
but nothing about this is rational.

02:36.770 --> 02:38.780
I'm being investigated for a crime that I didn't commit.

02:38.780 --> 02:41.939
Exactly. The stakes are too high to screw anything up.

02:41.939 --> 02:43.460
Doesn't matter anyway because, you know,

02:43.460 --> 02:45.219
I can't afford half of these attorneys. It's --

02:45.219 --> 02:46.639
You can't afford any of them,

02:47.060 --> 02:48.810
Which is why I'm going to help you.

02:49.069 --> 02:49.719
No.

02:51.150 --> 02:55.030
I'm with you every step of the way.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:35.210 --> 03:37.170
So, how many more lawyers are you meeting?

03:38.829 --> 03:40.310
Are you sure you don't need me to come over?

03:40.310 --> 03:42.629
I can have someone cover me at the store, Karen.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.120
Okay.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.439
Okay, but I will be there tomorrow night.

03:47.840 --> 03:48.800
Love you, too.

03:50.479 --> 03:51.870
What's happening here?

03:52.280 --> 03:53.900
What do you mean?

03:54.030 --> 03:56.319
You look like a car ran over your face.

03:56.409 --> 03:58.449
I think I'm coming down with something.

03:58.449 --> 03:59.750
Hopefully, I can beat whatever it is

03:59.750 --> 04:01.340
before Scotty gets back from Florida.

04:01.490 --> 04:02.849
Oh, I thought he was coming back today.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.250
Oh, my mom's keeping him a little longer.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.419
Doesn't he have school?

04:06.789 --> 04:08.330
I don't think two more days of kindergarten's

04:08.330 --> 04:09.800
gonna change his life, April.

04:12.629 --> 04:15.180
I'm guessing you're not gonna go to work tonight, then.

04:15.259 --> 04:16.709
I was off anyway. Why?

04:17.199 --> 04:19.290
Well, I'm supposed to see Blair later,

04:19.819 --> 04:21.379
and Lucy's sleeping over at Peyton's.

04:21.379 --> 04:22.910
Cool. Have fun.

04:24.689 --> 04:25.500
Thanks.

04:27.339 --> 04:29.920
Oh, if you're gonna be here, can you fix the sink?

04:29.920 --> 04:31.649
It's doing that thing still.

04:36.060 --> 04:37.920
Yeah. I'll take a look.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.199
Thanks.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.060
- It tastes like vodka. - It is vodka.

04:50.439 --> 04:52.909
I thought I'd try something a little outside the box.

04:53.379 --> 04:54.939
It's not really a tequila sunrise

04:54.939 --> 04:56.420
without tequila, though, is it?

04:57.569 --> 04:58.379
Try again.

05:02.730 --> 05:04.759
Thank God, someone who knows how to mix a proper drink.

05:04.759 --> 05:06.290
Any chance you can work tonight,

05:06.339 --> 05:08.370
help out with a little on-the-job training?

05:08.370 --> 05:10.730
Oh, I'm not feeling great, man. I'm just picking up my check.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.610
Okay. Fair enough.

05:13.769 --> 05:16.600
Oh, actually, I was wondering if I can get tomorrow off, too.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.769
My mom has to drop Scotty a couple days early,

05:18.850 --> 05:20.259
and I don't have a sitter.

05:20.519 --> 05:21.089
Oh, I can't.

05:21.089 --> 05:22.569
We're shorthanded already without Niko,

05:22.569 --> 05:25.370
And this is not going to cut it.

05:26.100 --> 05:26.850
See what I mean?

05:26.990 --> 05:28.790
Disaster. I'll see you tomorrow, then.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.889
There's no point Googling "tequila sunrise" now, mate.

05:35.889 --> 05:36.800
Let's get back to it.

05:37.180 --> 05:37.909
Dude,

05:38.579 --> 05:40.319
doesn't your ex work for Calista Raines?

05:41.269 --> 05:43.409
This you know, but you've never heard of a sazerac.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.490
Her husband was murdered three days ago.

05:45.490 --> 05:47.600
- It's all over TMZ. - What do you mean, murdered?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.170
...no arrests have been made.

05:48.170 --> 05:49.430
Local law enforcement are

05:49.430 --> 05:51.159
- still gathering evidence. - Like, to death.

05:51.159 --> 05:53.600
- Back to you, Donna. - Thank you. In other news...

05:53.720 --> 05:56.019
I called a couple friends at the L.A.P.D. about your case.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.470
You have friends at the L.A.P.D.?

05:57.560 --> 06:00.639
Yes. I like to be prepared before I take a meeting.

06:00.639 --> 06:02.810
There's no use in wasting your time or mine.

06:04.060 --> 06:06.629
Bad news first... you were at the crime scene,

06:06.680 --> 06:08.189
you didn't call the police for over an hour,

06:08.189 --> 06:09.600
and you did wash the clothe you were wearing,

06:09.600 --> 06:10.970
possibly destroying evidence.

06:10.970 --> 06:13.879
I wasn't destroying evidence. I was covered in blood.

06:15.670 --> 06:18.189
I'm sorry. I really... but I was covered in blood.

06:18.189 --> 06:19.560
Right. The blood is bad, too.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.629
What about Calista? Are they looking at her?

06:21.629 --> 06:22.910
They always suspect the wife,

06:23.149 --> 06:24.449
especially when there's infidelity.

06:24.449 --> 06:27.000
So why exactly are they asking me to come in again tomorrow?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.480
It doesn't have to be a bad thing.

06:28.899 --> 06:31.170
Show them you're a friend to this investigation.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.209
The idea is to go from a prime suspect

06:33.209 --> 06:34.170
to a star witness.

06:34.170 --> 06:35.610
Just tell them everything.

06:35.610 --> 06:37.670
Well, I don't... I already told them everything.

06:37.670 --> 06:38.430
Tell them again.

06:38.879 --> 06:41.029
Police value consistency of story.

06:41.029 --> 06:42.370
They'll ask the same question 10 times

06:42.470 --> 06:44.629
just to see if an answer will change even once.

06:44.750 --> 06:45.980
It's how they know you're telling the truth.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.310
I am telling the truth.

06:47.310 --> 06:49.990
That's good. Just keep doing that.

06:54.560 --> 06:55.459
You're hired.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.750
Then I guess I'd better clear my schedule for tomorrow.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.430
Let's get you out of this mess.

07:08.569 --> 07:09.810
Eva Petrov.

07:09.810 --> 07:11.589
Yes, I knew about that one.

07:13.089 --> 07:14.339
Jessica Parkins.

07:15.819 --> 07:17.829
Yes, and she was married, by the way.

07:18.709 --> 07:20.810
I'm sure her husband wasn't too thrilled.

07:22.029 --> 07:22.790
I'm sure.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.680
And Ms. Carver.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.569
Look, I think we can all agree

07:30.569 --> 07:32.829
that my husband didn't exercise the best discipline

07:32.829 --> 07:34.709
when it came to his personal affairs.

07:35.100 --> 07:38.370
But he did the same in business, and he had a lot of enemies.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.629
I really hope you're looking into that as well.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.529
Look, we are investigating every possible suspect.

07:47.209 --> 07:49.189
Now, we've already spoken with a number of people

07:49.189 --> 07:51.509
who work in your home, but we still have to account for

07:51.509 --> 07:53.500
a few of your husband's mistresses.

07:55.189 --> 07:55.800
Look, I'm sorry

07:55.800 --> 07:58.550
that I have to keep talking about this, the affairs.

07:58.829 --> 08:00.560
It must have been very difficult for you.

08:00.699 --> 08:02.189
I appreciate your concern.

08:03.699 --> 08:05.480
Look, I'm married. It's hard.

08:05.949 --> 08:07.689
Even without the infidelity.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.879
Did you ever think about divorce?

08:11.209 --> 08:13.160
I mean, one humiliation after another.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.100
It had to bother you.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.639
Is this an interview or relationship counseling?

08:17.129 --> 08:17.920
I think we're done here.

08:17.920 --> 08:19.160
No, I'm not done.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.009
I know what you're trying to do, detective.

08:27.810 --> 08:28.670
It did bother me.

08:29.639 --> 08:30.790
I'm a human being.

08:31.269 --> 08:33.539
But if every woman that's ever been cheated on

08:33.879 --> 08:35.110
was also a murderer,

08:35.110 --> 08:38.000
I have a feeling you'd be a hell of a lot busier here.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.019
Now, I appreciate

08:40.019 --> 08:43.350
how low you're willing to sink in the name of justice,

08:43.350 --> 08:47.720
but unless you have one actual shred of evidence against me,

08:47.720 --> 08:50.129
then I'd like to go put my life back together.

08:51.070 --> 08:54.519
To that end, when can my client return to her home?

08:55.370 --> 08:57.029
We have everything we need.

08:58.039 --> 08:59.450
We should be out of there today.

08:59.450 --> 09:00.990
Great. Then if you'll excuse me...

09:07.759 --> 09:08.929
Oh, God.

09:09.529 --> 09:10.659
Oh, that was fun.

09:11.039 --> 09:12.360
It was.

09:13.769 --> 09:14.919
You thought it wouldn't be?

09:15.269 --> 09:17.539
No. I mean, I knew it would be.

09:17.539 --> 09:19.019
I was just a little nervous.

09:19.389 --> 09:21.009
Oh. I couldn't tell.

09:22.389 --> 09:23.809
It was the first time.

09:23.809 --> 09:26.629
I was... I don't know. There was some pressure.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.179
Not from me, I hope.

09:28.940 --> 09:29.639
Not at all.

09:31.399 --> 09:34.389
You've were a complete gentleman.

09:39.659 --> 09:41.360
I totally forgot that was there.

09:42.259 --> 09:42.870
Is that...

09:42.870 --> 09:45.600
Lisa... my wife. Late wife.

09:46.049 --> 09:46.960
I'm sorry.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.580
Oh, don't apologize. I get it.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.730
If anyone gets it, it's me.

09:51.889 --> 09:54.279
I should have moved that picture. I didn't think of it.

09:55.509 --> 09:57.789
No one's been here since she passed.

09:59.149 --> 09:59.950
No one?

10:01.480 --> 10:03.080
Now you look really nervous.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.750
No, I mean, I just didn't realize

10:05.750 --> 10:07.649
you hadn't been with anyone.

10:07.720 --> 10:08.929
Oh, I have.

10:10.029 --> 10:11.590
Right. Of course.

10:11.590 --> 10:13.429
Jut not here.

10:17.480 --> 10:18.950
Calista, just one question!

10:19.059 --> 10:20.480
How did they get past the gate?

10:20.570 --> 10:21.340
Don't worry.

10:21.340 --> 10:23.559
We'll have them arrested for trespassing.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.950
You're all here. Thank you.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.799
It's just a crazy situation.

10:30.799 --> 10:31.429
You need to hydrate.

10:31.429 --> 10:32.980
We need to discuss a few things.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.279
Will you all excuse us?

10:37.830 --> 10:39.509
Wilson, did Joss call?

10:39.620 --> 10:40.429
I don't think so.

10:40.429 --> 10:42.230
Thank you, Wilson.

10:43.259 --> 10:45.970
You can't be talking to Joss right now.

10:46.259 --> 10:48.159
You understand that, right?

10:48.500 --> 10:50.399
Patty, she's still my friend.

10:50.399 --> 10:53.350
No, she is not. Not right now.

10:54.399 --> 10:57.190
Look, she didn't do it, okay?

10:57.440 --> 10:58.460
How do you know?

10:58.460 --> 11:01.269
'Cause I-I know, okay? I-I know her.

11:01.269 --> 11:05.149
For all of five minutes! Calista, I mean, come on!

11:05.740 --> 11:07.509
Did you know she was sleeping with Luca?

11:09.659 --> 11:12.090
What? Am I missing something?

11:12.090 --> 11:13.970
No. No.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.129
Not missing anything.

11:15.129 --> 11:17.279
It's just... just because someone does something stupid

11:17.279 --> 11:18.450
doesn't mean they're a murderer.

11:18.450 --> 11:21.210
Do not engage.

11:21.919 --> 11:23.009
You understand?

11:24.379 --> 11:26.370
Yes. Yes.

11:26.370 --> 11:27.049
Good.

11:27.490 --> 11:29.570
And remember, you're supposed to be in mourning.

11:30.799 --> 11:31.419
Wear some black,

11:31.419 --> 11:33.210
plan your dead husband's funeral.

11:33.210 --> 11:34.980
The press is watching.

11:35.309 --> 11:37.309
Yeah.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.029
Karen, honey, you really don't have to come with me, okay?

11:44.029 --> 11:45.649
David's meeting me down at the police station.

11:45.649 --> 11:46.399
It'll be okay.

11:46.659 --> 11:48.490
- Do you not want me there? - No.

11:48.730 --> 11:50.350
Honey, I just... I feel bad.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.889
I'm hijacking your entire life.

11:51.889 --> 11:54.399
You know, you... you need to mourn your breakup properly.

11:54.399 --> 11:56.480
Well, it's hard to mourn for something

11:56.480 --> 11:58.200
that always felt somewhat inevitable.

11:58.649 --> 12:00.379
Not that I didn't love Alec and Vivian,

12:00.379 --> 12:04.440
but where was it ever gonna go, right?

12:04.860 --> 12:06.360
I-I don't know. That may be true.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.730
But does it really make the pain any less?

12:10.850 --> 12:12.029
Are you expecting someone?

12:18.399 --> 12:18.970
What are you...

12:18.970 --> 12:19.789
I've been calling since yesterday.

12:19.789 --> 12:20.730
Where's Joss?

12:21.490 --> 12:22.059
Joss?

12:22.440 --> 12:23.990
Hey, what the hell is going on?

12:24.070 --> 12:25.759
I just heard about this Luca Raines thing.

12:25.759 --> 12:27.539
Harry, I can't do this with you right now.

12:28.590 --> 12:29.360
You can't do what?

12:29.440 --> 12:30.600
I just want to make sure you're okay.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.269
- No, I'm fine. - Really?

12:32.269 --> 12:34.179
You don't seem fine. She doesn't seem fine.

12:34.529 --> 12:35.840
- She's fine. - Joss, hey.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.149
What -- what's happening?

12:40.149 --> 12:41.539
I'm being accused of murder.

12:42.649 --> 12:43.169
What?

12:43.169 --> 12:45.330
Yeah, and you slept with Niko, right?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.100
I got to go.

12:52.879 --> 12:54.509
It was a mistake, Karen. A one-time thing.

12:54.509 --> 12:58.320
It's not about you, Harry. She's overwhelmed.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.059
How -- how can I help? I want to help.

13:00.059 --> 13:01.889
I know you do, but you can't right now.

13:02.309 --> 13:03.700
You're only going to make her more upset.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.070
Well, I can't just sit here and do nothing.

13:05.070 --> 13:08.129
I'm taking care of her. I promise.

13:12.490 --> 13:13.610
So, you had a key to the house.

13:13.610 --> 13:15.559
Yes. But a lot of people did.

13:15.830 --> 13:16.539
Who else?

13:17.899 --> 13:21.529
Her assistant, Wilson. The housekeeper, Maritza.

13:22.139 --> 13:23.279
Carlos, the gardener.

13:23.279 --> 13:24.059
We're not contesting

13:24.059 --> 13:25.460
that my client was at the house that night.

13:25.460 --> 13:28.370
Oh, I didn't say you were. I'm just counting keys.

13:29.049 --> 13:29.669
Of course.

13:30.789 --> 13:31.549
Hey, speaking of Carlos,

13:31.549 --> 13:33.100
did you know that he and luca

13:33.100 --> 13:35.559
had a physical altercation several months ago?

13:35.559 --> 13:37.419
Oh, no. I didn't know Calista several months ago.

13:37.419 --> 13:40.279
But Carlos and Luca, that doesn't sound good.

13:40.330 --> 13:42.100
That might be something to look into, yeah?

13:42.620 --> 13:44.629
That is just what we are trying to do.

13:45.850 --> 13:47.639
So, how often was Carlos in the house?

13:49.019 --> 13:50.899
Um, what do you mean?

13:51.440 --> 13:53.590
Well, did he spend any time in the house,

13:53.590 --> 13:54.850
or just outside?

13:55.549 --> 13:57.379
Mostly outside, I think.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.850
And what about the basement?

13:59.850 --> 14:01.070
Is that where he kept his tools?

14:02.279 --> 14:03.190
I have no idea.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.370
Oh, so you were never in the basement yourself?

14:05.370 --> 14:07.059
Me? No.

14:07.259 --> 14:08.940
These are starting to sound like questions for Carlos,

14:08.940 --> 14:09.799
not my client.

14:09.799 --> 14:11.690
Um, moving on.

14:13.450 --> 14:14.169
Yeah.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.070
Excuse me.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.629
Could I get some water, please?

14:23.629 --> 14:25.639
Hey, are you okay? You're all sweaty.

14:25.929 --> 14:27.730
Police stations still make me queasy.

14:28.059 --> 14:30.500
I think I might be having a mild anxiety attack.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.279
Oh, no, Karen.

14:32.149 --> 14:32.879
I'll be fine.

14:33.379 --> 14:34.080
How'd it go?

14:34.720 --> 14:37.830
Um good, I-I think.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.379
- Right? - It was fine.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.779
- What was that? - What was what?

14:44.210 --> 14:46.360
You just did a funny thing with your eyebrows.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.100
What does that mean?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.000
To be honest, there was something

14:50.000 --> 14:52.039
about some of those questions that rubbed me the wrong way.

14:52.039 --> 14:52.629
Why?

14:53.139 --> 14:56.059
I'm not sure yet. It was probably nothing.

15:06.230 --> 15:07.059
Hello?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.250
April?

15:48.509 --> 15:49.289
Lucy?

15:53.629 --> 15:54.409
Anybody home?

16:14.730 --> 16:16.669
Then we need flowers for the coffin

16:16.669 --> 16:19.870
and flowers for the altar, but no lilies.

16:20.899 --> 16:24.039
I understand they're a traditional funeral bloom,

16:24.100 --> 16:25.279
but I don't like them.

16:25.549 --> 16:28.379
And I don't think my late husband's gonna care either way.

16:29.299 --> 16:31.460
Yes, orchids are fine.

16:35.769 --> 16:36.429
You know what?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.799
Can you make it a-another bouquet,

16:39.929 --> 16:41.570
But can it be delivered same day?

16:42.940 --> 16:43.669
Great.

16:44.190 --> 16:46.029
Yeah, no, it's a different account,

16:46.419 --> 16:47.960
Going to a different address.

16:55.659 --> 16:56.830
What are those?

16:57.460 --> 16:59.570
They're flowers. For you.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.639
You didn't have to do that.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.029
And that's why I did it.

17:05.470 --> 17:08.019
And I moved that picture out of the bedroom.

17:08.490 --> 17:09.910
You didn't have to do that, either.

17:09.910 --> 17:12.250
I did it for me. It was time.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.279
It's hard to let go.

17:15.150 --> 17:17.220
I think it's just easier not to change anything.

17:17.220 --> 17:17.799
But...

17:19.098 --> 17:21.220
you have reminded me that this next part of my life

17:21.220 --> 17:22.660
is whatever I want to make it.

17:23.348 --> 17:24.890
I don't know what you can see in your next chapter,

17:24.890 --> 17:26.029
But I can see you in mine.

17:33.359 --> 17:35.289
I could really use a nap.

17:35.420 --> 17:36.869
Me too. I'm exhausted.

17:37.970 --> 17:38.809
What is that?

17:39.430 --> 17:40.470
I have no idea.

17:41.750 --> 17:42.869
Maybe it's from Alec.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.140
Or Vivian.

17:44.279 --> 17:45.079
Or both.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.079
That's nice.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.390
"I love you.

17:57.390 --> 17:59.000
We're gonna get through this together.

18:01.869 --> 18:03.049
From Calista."

18:03.549 --> 18:04.390
You're kidding.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.160
What the hell is wrong with this woman?

18:10.779 --> 18:12.420
Seriously, why is she doing this to me, Karen?

18:12.799 --> 18:14.250
Why? I don't understand!

18:14.339 --> 18:15.140
Honey, don't.

18:15.930 --> 18:17.609
No, I-it's my fault, right?

18:17.609 --> 18:19.250
I-I thought that she was my friend.

18:19.250 --> 18:20.819
How could I be so stupid?

18:20.819 --> 18:21.690
You aren't stupid.

18:21.690 --> 18:24.029
You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.190
And you were vulnerable. You just lost your sister.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.180
Right, right. And then there's Savi.

18:30.839 --> 18:33.000
How messed up is it that all of this is happening,

18:33.000 --> 18:34.349
She knows nothing about it?

18:34.569 --> 18:35.930
I'm being investigated for murder, and what,

18:35.930 --> 18:38.839
she's just off in Italy figuring out her feelings?

18:39.140 --> 18:40.430
You're not alone, Joss.

18:40.430 --> 18:41.980
April and I are here for you.

18:41.980 --> 18:45.950
But she's not here, Karen. She just abandoned me.

18:45.950 --> 18:46.549
What --

18:48.170 --> 18:49.000
I hate her.

18:50.119 --> 18:52.650
I do. I hate her.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.069
- Where the hell have you been? - I'm 10 minutes late.

19:15.069 --> 19:16.869
20 minutes late, and I've been calling you all day.

19:16.869 --> 19:18.160
Sorry, but my phone was off.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.250
Did you tell April about Niko?

19:19.250 --> 19:20.839
Who? No. What?

19:22.359 --> 19:23.359
Are you drunk?

19:23.940 --> 19:24.750
I'm fine.

19:24.890 --> 19:27.180
- You're drunk. - I had one drink.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.039
Like hell you did.

19:28.039 --> 19:29.880
You can't work like this. Get out of my restaurant.

19:31.029 --> 19:31.900
No problem.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.970
I wanted tonight off in the first place, remember?

19:39.599 --> 19:40.289
You know what, Karen?

19:40.289 --> 19:42.450
Screw the salad. I want a burger, okay?

19:42.450 --> 19:43.680
I've earned a freaking' burger.

19:45.069 --> 19:46.410
Somebody's calling on the other line. Hold on.

19:46.869 --> 19:47.390
Hello?

19:47.390 --> 19:48.549
Joss, it's David Hudson.

19:49.029 --> 19:51.599
Yeah, I just want to make sure that you understood the strategy

19:51.599 --> 19:53.200
behind going back to the police.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.099
All you had to do was tell

19:54.099 --> 19:55.750
- the truth about what happened. - Yeah, I know.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.470
The truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth.

19:57.470 --> 19:58.819
But you didn't tell the whole truth.

19:58.819 --> 20:00.359
Actually, you outright lied.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.940
Whoa, what are you talking about?

20:01.940 --> 20:02.980
You told the detective

20:02.980 --> 20:04.619
that you'd never been in the basement.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.400
But the police found your fingerprints

20:06.400 --> 20:07.650
on the basement doorknob,

20:07.650 --> 20:09.059
the basement where the power was cut

20:09.059 --> 20:10.930
right before Luca was shot.

20:11.660 --> 20:12.619
Oh, no.

20:12.619 --> 20:13.970
I mean, what?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.950
Oh, no, David, I --

20:16.710 --> 20:18.569
See, I never actually went inside the basement,

20:18.569 --> 20:20.730
but I-I opened the basement door for the, uh, tech guy,

20:20.730 --> 20:21.869
the one who was setting up the camera

20:21.869 --> 20:23.549
in the bedroom to catch Luca, the plan.

20:23.549 --> 20:25.569
You mean the plan that no other witness will corroborate?

20:25.569 --> 20:26.529
Yeah, but, David, listen to me.

20:26.529 --> 20:27.890
It was an innocent mistake, okay?

20:27.890 --> 20:29.339
Just let's call the detective back

20:29.339 --> 20:31.849
- and I can explain everything. - That is not a good idea.

20:31.849 --> 20:34.619
David, I'm so sorry. I -- what can I do?

20:34.619 --> 20:35.200
Sit tight.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.970
Don't say anything else to anyone else.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.329
Just...do nothing, okay?

20:39.990 --> 20:40.819
Okay.

20:41.190 --> 20:42.670
David, how bad is this?

20:44.809 --> 20:45.869
I don't know yet.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.369
Okay.

21:01.730 --> 21:02.700
Is Calista here?

21:02.700 --> 21:04.400
No press. Private property.

21:04.799 --> 21:07.289
I'm not press. I need to talk to Calista.

21:07.410 --> 21:09.299
Miss Raines is not here.

21:09.299 --> 21:11.259
- What's going on? - I tried to stop her.

21:11.269 --> 21:14.750
Karen, uh... I'm glad you're here.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.609
Did, um... Joss get the flowers?

21:17.609 --> 21:19.579
Joss told you to stay away from her.

21:19.589 --> 21:21.589
What part of that didn't you understand?

21:22.119 --> 21:23.900
I-I think you misunderstood.

21:23.900 --> 21:26.579
I-I care about Joss just as much as you do.

21:26.579 --> 21:28.839
She's one of my best friends.

21:28.839 --> 21:30.609
You don't even know what that means.

21:30.609 --> 21:32.569
You don't put friends on your payroll.

21:32.569 --> 21:33.859
And you don't sell them down the river

21:33.859 --> 21:35.650
when things aren't going your way.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.640
That's not what --

21:36.640 --> 21:39.019
Look, I have no idea what your involvement is

21:39.019 --> 21:41.470
in Luca's death, but I do know what you did to Joss,

21:41.480 --> 21:43.319
and that's all I care about right now.

21:43.319 --> 21:46.880
So, do me a favor -- stay away.

21:48.130 --> 21:50.809
Hey, you know what? You came to my house.

21:53.039 --> 21:54.410
Don't make me do it again.

21:59.880 --> 22:02.329
Sorry. The restaurant messed up the order.

22:02.329 --> 22:03.890
I had to wait forever.

22:05.630 --> 22:06.750
What are you two doing?

22:06.940 --> 22:07.880
Googling.

22:08.569 --> 22:09.579
Googling what?

22:09.579 --> 22:10.950
Googling Calista.

22:11.559 --> 22:12.349
Why?

22:14.180 --> 22:16.559
Because I accidentally messed up at my interview yesterday,

22:16.559 --> 22:17.759
and now David's mad at me.

22:17.759 --> 22:18.819
And I'm not just gonna sit around,

22:18.819 --> 22:19.930
waiting for him to fix it.

22:19.930 --> 22:21.599
There has to be something somewhere

22:21.599 --> 22:23.029
that looks bad on Calista.

22:23.029 --> 22:24.240
We just haven't found it yet.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.680
I really need this burger.

22:26.950 --> 22:28.460
So, how was last night?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.430
We don't have to talk about that right now.

22:32.839 --> 22:34.210
Was last night the night?

22:35.240 --> 22:36.730
Oh, my god. Please, can we talk about it?

22:36.730 --> 22:38.730
Please? I really need a brain break.

22:39.119 --> 22:40.099
It was fine.

22:42.579 --> 22:43.720
"It was fine"?

22:44.769 --> 22:46.980
No, no. It was good. It was nice.

22:50.150 --> 22:51.880
Stop it. It really was.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.309
And he brought me flowers today.

22:54.319 --> 22:55.700
Well, that is nice.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.450
Yeah, he's different from any guy I've ever been with.

22:57.450 --> 23:00.500
He's solid. He's honest.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.359
He's a strong man who could take care of me and Lucy.

23:03.359 --> 23:05.190
I know it doesn't sound very progressive of me,

23:05.190 --> 23:07.910
but given everything we've been through, I can use a break.

23:07.910 --> 23:09.410
What does Lucy think?

23:10.670 --> 23:12.369
She likes him, I think.

23:12.559 --> 23:13.750
We haven't really talked about it yet.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.990
- Seriously? - She raises money for the Red Cross.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.039
You got to be kidding me, right?

23:17.039 --> 23:19.180
That's the kind of thing you're gonna find, honey.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.089
She has an entire team of professional publicists

23:22.089 --> 23:24.190
whose only job is keeping up her image.

23:24.190 --> 23:25.680
Wait a second. You're right.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.930
We're not gonna find anything on Calista,

23:26.940 --> 23:29.099
but we might find something on Carla Rizzotti.

23:29.099 --> 23:30.069
- Who? - Carla rizzotti.

23:30.069 --> 23:31.990
Before she was some international brand,

23:31.990 --> 23:33.700
she was just some girl from Queens who didn't have

23:33.700 --> 23:35.960
a freaking publicist to scrub anything for her.

23:36.759 --> 23:38.319
I can't believe I forgot that.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.430
What are you doing here?

23:54.130 --> 23:58.279
Uh...I used your spare under the paint can.

23:58.319 --> 24:00.250
- Remember, you told me. - I mean, why are you here now?

24:00.250 --> 24:01.269
Oh, that.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.150
I came to quit.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.500
No need, mate. You're already fired.

24:07.890 --> 24:09.000
What, seriously?

24:09.009 --> 24:10.319
You'd fire me after one screw-up?

24:10.319 --> 24:11.529
- Man, that's messed up. - You show up

24:11.529 --> 24:13.940
- to work drunk, which is bad enough. - Come on.

24:14.099 --> 24:16.250
But the fact that you told April my business?

24:16.250 --> 24:17.089
What business? I didn't say anything.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.329
Niko!

24:20.059 --> 24:21.730
Oh, that. Right.

24:21.900 --> 24:25.240
Okay, I told April about Niko, but I didn't want to.

24:25.849 --> 24:27.930
And April said she wasn't gonna tell Joss.

24:27.930 --> 24:28.759
And you believed her?

24:28.759 --> 24:30.940
Those girls tell each other what they have for breakfast.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.230
Yeah, well, I'm new in town, okay?

24:32.230 --> 24:33.750
I don't know all the rules of their coven.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.150
You could have warned me, at least.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.599
I thought we were better friends than that.

24:37.599 --> 24:39.940
Look, I screwed up, okay? And I'm sorry about that, man.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.240
But come on!

24:42.299 --> 24:43.630
How good of friends could we really be?

24:43.630 --> 24:45.200
You didn't even know I was sober.

24:46.950 --> 24:47.809
What?

24:48.150 --> 24:49.750
What are you talking about, "sober"?

24:50.180 --> 24:52.349
We just had a drink the other day here.

24:52.529 --> 24:54.299
Yeah, it was first one in three years.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.680
Oh, my god.

24:59.720 --> 25:01.059
Oh, no.

25:02.190 --> 25:03.720
Not that it's your fault, of course.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.690
I'm the alcoholic.

25:04.690 --> 25:07.160
Marc, I had absolutely no idea.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.460
I'm -- I'm sorry.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.430
Yeah, we all got our problems, right?

25:12.170 --> 25:13.960
Look, anyway, I appreciate the opportunity

25:13.960 --> 25:15.509
and whatnot, but I'm --

25:16.430 --> 25:17.440
Easy, mate. No, no, no.

25:17.440 --> 25:18.490
- You can't go anywhere like that. - I'm okay. I'm okay.

25:18.490 --> 25:19.579
- Just sleep it off on the couch. - I'm okay.

25:19.579 --> 25:20.990
No, you're not. You're not. You're not.

25:20.990 --> 25:25.670
Just stay here, okay? Just sleep it off, okay?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.910
- All right. - Now, let me get this for you.

25:36.589 --> 25:37.500
I'm okay.

26:10.150 --> 26:10.859
Hello?

26:11.190 --> 26:12.549
Father John, it's Karen Kim.

26:12.549 --> 26:13.930
Oh, hey, Karen. How are you?

26:13.930 --> 26:15.779
Not too well, unfortunately.

26:16.029 --> 26:18.119
I'm sorry for such late notice,

26:18.119 --> 26:20.670
but, um, I think I have to cancel class today.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.160
Oh, no apology necessary.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.750
Is everything all right?

26:24.940 --> 26:28.420
Actually things aren't great right now.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.009
My friend is going through something,

26:30.009 --> 26:32.509
And it's been stressful.

26:33.619 --> 26:34.920
You want to come talk about it?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.269
It's kind of what I'm here for.

26:39.690 --> 26:41.730
Hey. What are you working on?

26:42.170 --> 26:43.339
Math.

26:45.079 --> 26:46.509
- How's it going? - Fine.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.349
Hey, did you see the flowers in the kitchen?

26:53.349 --> 26:54.650
Blair got them for me.

26:56.559 --> 26:58.289
He's a good guy, don't you think?

26:58.650 --> 26:59.460
I don't know.

27:00.269 --> 27:01.210
You can't not know.

27:01.210 --> 27:03.460
You either like someone or you don't.

27:04.140 --> 27:05.640
All right. I don't like him.

27:08.799 --> 27:10.240
Is there a reason?

27:11.440 --> 27:12.359
I just don't.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.730
That woman is no good.

27:21.579 --> 27:23.460
No good since the day I met her.

27:26.190 --> 27:29.029
And w-where did your son meet Carla?

27:29.240 --> 27:30.440
Some bar.

27:30.789 --> 27:33.450
He just moved to New York. He didn't know anyone.

27:33.789 --> 27:34.990
And they just started dating?

27:34.990 --> 27:36.509
It was all very fast.

27:36.509 --> 27:39.259
He said he met this girl, and after that,

27:39.259 --> 27:41.670
they were together all the time.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.930
I knew he was gonna marry her.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.089
And he did.

27:46.500 --> 27:50.019
Did -- did they have any, uh, problems in their marriage

27:50.019 --> 27:51.220
that you know of?

27:52.220 --> 27:53.039
No.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.579
Even though I didn't like her, he -- he loved her.

27:56.859 --> 27:58.029
He was happy.

27:58.829 --> 28:03.410
That's the thing -- the police said my son killed himself.

28:03.599 --> 28:06.069
Now, why would a happy man take his own life?

28:06.069 --> 28:08.720
- It makes no sense. - No, it doesn't.

28:10.670 --> 28:12.720
My Justin was a sweet boy.

28:15.359 --> 28:16.970
All he ever wanted was a family

28:16.970 --> 28:20.460
and enough money to put a roof over their heads.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.019
He wasn't ambitious, not like her.

28:23.460 --> 28:24.960
She wanted to take over the world

28:24.960 --> 28:28.000
and trample anyone who got in her way.

28:30.200 --> 28:34.099
Justin... he got in her way.

28:35.890 --> 28:38.269
They said my son shot himself.

28:38.269 --> 28:41.069
He didn't even have a gun. It was Carla's.

28:41.069 --> 28:42.849
For protection, she said.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.690
Do you think that she had something to do with his death?

28:45.769 --> 28:49.000
I don't think she did, I know she did.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.400
I used to have nightmares about it.

28:54.109 --> 28:56.069
I would see Elizabeth holding the gun.

28:56.069 --> 29:00.160
I would see Sam... lying there on the floor.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.319
That sounds awful.

29:01.319 --> 29:05.490
It was, and it took months of therapy and medication,

29:05.490 --> 29:08.500
But I finally felt like I closed that door.

29:10.369 --> 29:11.049
Now it feels like

29:11.049 --> 29:13.089
the whole thing is happening all over again.

29:13.089 --> 29:14.170
But it isn't.

29:14.210 --> 29:15.809
This is a different situation.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.549
I know, but Joss is living in my house,

29:18.549 --> 29:21.240
and I'm holding her hand through all of this.

29:22.079 --> 29:26.240
I don't want her to feel what I felt -- scared and alone.

29:26.789 --> 29:28.009
Joss isn't alone.

29:28.259 --> 29:29.349
And neither are you.

29:29.750 --> 29:31.859
God has a plan for all of us.

29:31.869 --> 29:34.170
We just have to learn to surrender to it.

29:34.490 --> 29:36.500
Otherwise, we'll worry ourselves sick.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.589
And worry is a prayer for what you don't want.

29:40.220 --> 29:41.809
I'll try to remember that.

29:42.630 --> 29:45.519
It's just hard when it seems to manifest physically.

29:45.529 --> 29:48.309
Well, in those cases, it also never hurts to see a doctor.

29:48.990 --> 29:51.190
Remember, god also created xanax.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.109
So, you're telling me Calista Raines

29:57.109 --> 29:58.359
is some kind of black widow?

29:58.359 --> 29:59.009
It's not just me.

29:59.009 --> 30:00.950
Calista's own mother-in-law thinks so, too.

30:00.950 --> 30:02.660
Well, her former mother-in-law.

30:02.660 --> 30:03.619
Did she contact the police?

30:03.630 --> 30:04.619
She said nobody would listen.

30:04.619 --> 30:06.779
She wouldn't be the first mother to cry foul play.

30:07.130 --> 30:08.299
Suicides can be hard to accept.

30:08.299 --> 30:09.599
Yeah, but what are the odds that one woman

30:09.609 --> 30:11.990
would have two dead husbands, both by a gun?

30:13.190 --> 30:14.210
Didn't I specifically tell you

30:14.210 --> 30:16.079
to sit tight, not talk to anyone?

30:16.079 --> 30:18.410
Yeah, well, I'm not great at sitting tight or rules.

30:18.420 --> 30:19.549
So I'm learning.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.839
So you're telling me we can't use any of this?

30:24.069 --> 30:25.140
I didn't say that.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.000
Sleeping beauty awakes.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.740
Food and coffee.

30:41.539 --> 30:42.640
What time is it?

30:43.670 --> 30:45.299
It's nowhere close to morning.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.829
I certainly hope Scotty isn't waiting for you at April's.

30:49.940 --> 30:50.869
No.

30:52.190 --> 30:53.009
I lied about that.

30:53.009 --> 30:55.079
He's -- he's coming home tomorrow.

30:55.829 --> 30:58.269
Ah. Probably for the best, from the looks of you.

30:58.509 --> 31:00.109
Look, man, I'm really sorry about last night.

31:00.119 --> 31:03.029
I-I didn't mean to drag you into my whole thing.

31:03.579 --> 31:04.809
I'll -- I'll be out of your hair ASAP.

31:04.809 --> 31:05.920
No, it's -- it's all right, mate.

31:05.930 --> 31:06.519
I'm sorry, too.

31:06.519 --> 31:09.339
I should have bloody noticed you weren't drinking.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.269
Although it is a bit odd

31:11.269 --> 31:13.700
you didn't mention it in your job interview.

31:13.970 --> 31:15.900
I probably wouldn't have got the job if I did.

31:17.390 --> 31:18.250
Maybe.

31:19.490 --> 31:20.359
Of course, I didn't know you then.

31:20.359 --> 31:22.660
But now that I do, I want to help.

31:23.799 --> 31:24.970
But I know alcoholics.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.349
My dad was an alcoholic,

31:27.349 --> 31:28.930
and I know you have to want the help,

31:28.940 --> 31:31.809
so I need to know where you are in this.

31:33.119 --> 31:35.859
Is this the beginning of the slide or the end?

31:36.099 --> 31:38.950
I want it to be the end. I-I need it to be the end.

31:39.700 --> 31:41.380
I got to be there for Scotty, you know?

31:41.380 --> 31:41.900
For me, too.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.420
Oh, good. Then you're not fired.

31:43.420 --> 31:44.900
Oh, that's really cool of you, Harry,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.019
but I'm not so sure I should be working behind a bar anymore.

31:46.019 --> 31:47.549
No, I agree.

31:47.549 --> 31:49.119
That's why I'm moving you to the back of the house,

31:49.119 --> 31:51.700
as long as you're serious about getting back on track.

31:53.049 --> 31:53.829
I am.

31:55.140 --> 31:55.869
Good.

31:55.910 --> 31:57.460
Then you're gonna call your sponsor.

31:58.099 --> 31:58.970
Now, yeah?

32:09.859 --> 32:12.630
I didn't really get a chance to charge up last night.

32:15.559 --> 32:16.589
Can I borrow yours?

32:19.230 --> 32:20.109
You bet.

32:33.720 --> 32:36.190
Hey, Jeremy. It's Marc.

32:41.559 --> 32:42.809
We have an issue.

32:43.650 --> 32:44.380
What now?

32:44.380 --> 32:47.980
The police are talking to Sandra Bowler today.

32:51.559 --> 32:53.220
What? What? Why?

32:53.220 --> 32:55.650
What -- how would they even make a connection?

32:55.650 --> 32:58.720
They didn't. Someone made it for them.

33:00.109 --> 33:02.019
Sandra contacted the police?

33:02.019 --> 33:04.259
She's so crazy.

33:04.259 --> 33:06.660
She has been after me for years!

33:06.670 --> 33:09.339
She didn't contact them, Calista.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.759
Joss' lawyer did.

33:13.009 --> 33:14.890
Joss -- no -- how --

33:16.769 --> 33:18.970
Still think she's your best friend?

33:28.970 --> 33:30.430
This does not look fresh.

33:33.069 --> 33:34.970
Wh-- okay! I --

33:34.970 --> 33:36.430
All right, all right, all right!

33:36.789 --> 33:37.490
Yeah?

33:37.650 --> 33:39.519
Who the hell do you think you are?

33:40.230 --> 33:41.579
What the hell are you doing here?

33:41.579 --> 33:43.660
You're digging through my trash?

33:44.599 --> 33:47.160
Uh, I'm just doing what you did and looking out for myself.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.779
No, no, no. I did nothing to you.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.490
I was protecting myself.

33:50.490 --> 33:53.299
You are actively looking for ways to take me down.

33:53.299 --> 33:54.720
Oh, please. I --

33:54.720 --> 33:57.680
Justin's death was the worst thing that ever happened to me,

33:57.680 --> 33:59.220
And now I have to relive it,

33:59.220 --> 34:00.630
and they're using it against me?

34:00.630 --> 34:01.640
If that's what it takes to get the truth,

34:01.640 --> 34:02.569
Calista, so be it.

34:02.569 --> 34:04.279
Do you honestly think

34:04.279 --> 34:07.099
I had anything to do with this, that I killed Luca?

34:07.099 --> 34:09.820
I don't think that you did it, I know that you did it.

34:16.230 --> 34:17.369
Karen was right.

34:17.369 --> 34:19.219
- Karen? - We're not friends.

34:19.219 --> 34:20.018
When did you see karen?

34:20.018 --> 34:21.539
Good luck to you, kid.

34:21.590 --> 34:22.800
You're gonna need it.

34:30.409 --> 34:32.559
Nobody knows how to wash a dish in this house?

35:02.769 --> 35:03.960
Hey, you.

35:05.210 --> 35:06.630
What are you doing right now?

35:08.110 --> 35:11.369
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice, detective.

35:12.219 --> 35:14.280
Well, curiosity got the better of me.

35:14.429 --> 35:16.320
I didn't think I'd be seeing you again.

35:17.019 --> 35:18.610
Not of your own volition, anyway.

35:18.809 --> 35:21.659
There's plenty of places I would rather be, believe me.

35:23.710 --> 35:24.460
But, um...

35:26.309 --> 35:30.199
I just -- I can't get the tape out of my mind.

35:31.650 --> 35:33.559
The one of Joss and my husband.

35:33.849 --> 35:38.539
It's, uh -- it's been bothering me ever since I saw it.

35:39.880 --> 35:40.699
Okay.

35:42.550 --> 35:45.630
I just -- I couldn't believe it was true, you know?

35:45.630 --> 35:49.260
It just -- just doesn't ring true of the Joss I knew.

35:51.210 --> 35:52.059
Why not?

35:54.260 --> 35:56.170
'Cause she was so devoted to me.

36:00.510 --> 36:05.389
She was, um... almost oppressive.

36:05.429 --> 36:06.610
Oppressive?

36:06.690 --> 36:07.480
Yeah.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.030
I mean, now that I look at it in the clear light of day,

36:11.039 --> 36:15.829
It was -- it was almost like she was a little obsessed with me.

36:15.829 --> 36:18.809
Like, "Single white female" obsessed.

36:19.789 --> 36:21.110
What makes you think that?

36:21.980 --> 36:24.960
I don't know. Just, she was always wherever I was,

36:24.960 --> 36:28.230
and some of the things she would say and...

36:29.219 --> 36:30.760
say about Luca.

36:31.639 --> 36:32.789
What kind of things?

36:34.190 --> 36:36.789
Like, for instance, we had a party a couple weeks ago,

36:36.789 --> 36:37.789
and Eva was there,

36:37.789 --> 36:41.210
and Luca...didn't hide his attraction to her.

36:41.210 --> 36:45.619
And...Joss was there, and she was so upset.

36:45.619 --> 36:48.110
And she said, "You know, I would kill him for you."

36:48.260 --> 36:51.150
You know, I-I thought it was just an expression, but now...

36:52.010 --> 36:54.329
You think she meant she would literally kill him?

36:54.329 --> 36:56.010
I don't know what she meant.

36:56.389 --> 36:58.500
I just know that she said it,

36:58.500 --> 37:00.420
and now he's dead, so...

37:03.199 --> 37:04.110
You tell me.

37:06.269 --> 37:07.969
When did the anxiety return?

37:08.440 --> 37:09.800
Just the last few days.

37:09.809 --> 37:11.909
I've been dealing with some external stress,

37:11.909 --> 37:13.400
which is what triggered it.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.920
Were you thinking of going back to the benzodiazepine?

37:16.050 --> 37:17.489
I'd like to start with the lowest dose

37:17.489 --> 37:18.789
and see how things go.

37:18.789 --> 37:19.820
I agree.

37:19.980 --> 37:22.179
I just need to run through the standard questions.

37:22.190 --> 37:22.989
Of course.

37:23.460 --> 37:27.389
Any chest pain or tightness during these episodes?

37:27.389 --> 37:30.119
We want to make sure it's anxiety and nothing vascular.

37:30.119 --> 37:32.590
No, nothing like that. It's more of a stomachache.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.000
Any digestive problems? Gas or constipation?

37:35.000 --> 37:36.420
A little, yes.

37:36.829 --> 37:38.440
Are you taking any new medications

37:38.440 --> 37:39.510
since your last visit?

37:39.519 --> 37:40.440
Nothing new.

37:40.440 --> 37:42.949
- Any chance of pregnancy? - I'm on the pill.

37:43.329 --> 37:45.130
No missed doses, doubling up?

37:48.110 --> 37:49.530
Once or twice.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.469
Why don't we do a test to be safe?

38:08.800 --> 38:10.010
Josslyn Carver...

38:10.489 --> 38:13.429
You are under arrest for the murder of Luca Raines.

38:14.239 --> 38:16.309
What? Wait, wait, wait.

38:16.309 --> 38:17.760
You have the right to remain silent.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.349
- No, wait! - Anything you say

38:19.349 --> 38:21.679
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

38:22.590 --> 38:24.219
You have the right to an attorney.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.159
Okay, Denise. Thanks.
