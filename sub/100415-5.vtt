00:45.796 --> 00:47.381
You said bring the funk.

00:47.423 --> 00:48.382
And you brought it.

00:48.424 --> 00:50.676
In spades.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.431
Wear it outside your pants,

00:55.473 --> 00:58.601
so they can feel your pain.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.688
Who did these?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.106
Major Crimes.

01:04.148 --> 01:05.107
First-rate...

01:05.149 --> 01:07.359
Mr. Dominic Reilly.

01:07.401 --> 01:10.404
Got you a few essentials.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.744
Ex-Lax?

01:16.786 --> 01:19.079
Opioids are instant cement.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.874
Peppermint oil.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.335
Just a drop.
Irritates the cornea,

01:24.376 --> 01:26.921
for that long-term bloodshot
dope fiend look.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.923
Visine, if you overdo it.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.383
They piss test me,

01:31.425 --> 01:33.636
it's gonna come up clean.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.389
Freeze-dried addict urine.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.601
Flick a little of this
in your specimen.

01:40.643 --> 01:41.977
It'll fool a panel test.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.604
They send it to a lab,
you're screwed.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.481
But labs cost money and time.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.777
A cane? Seriously?

01:49.819 --> 01:51.028
Sells the bad knee.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.780
Don't take it through TSA.

01:52.822 --> 01:56.450
Twist the top and pull, gently.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.288
You won't have a weapon,
and you may need one.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.832
Attitude is crucial.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.458
Can you do compliant?

02:04.500 --> 02:05.501
I'm famous for it.

02:05.543 --> 02:06.836
It's my middle name.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.254
You show spine, you're blown.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.256
I'm not gonna be under
that long.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.132
Find my killers, then adios.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.676
Your funeral.

02:13.717 --> 02:16.679
Can you get a crappy gun
and disable it?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.847
What do you mean?

02:17.888 --> 02:18.889
Like, file the pin?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.432
Guy like you, vet,

02:20.474 --> 02:21.934
he'd have a gun.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.061
Disabled gun
isn't gonna do me much good.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.896
They can't kill you with it,
either.

Fuck this. I'm out of here.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.408
My mistake.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.910
Just thought
you wanted a couple 80s.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.664
Yeah.

07:35.706 --> 07:37.499
Any more guff, Gramps,

Excellent.

Johnson and Moore?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.458
I give 'em six months.

to talk to you both--

08:22.211 --> 08:24.171
just an advisory--

08:24.213 --> 08:26.924
Bureau is auditing
our UCR stats.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.092
Why? Is there a problem?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.094
Routine spot check.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.763
Didn't want you
to be caught off guard.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.473
Thanks for the heads-up.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.474
Mm.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.475
Whatever happens,

08:36.516 --> 08:38.143
I've got your backs.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.561
Appreciate that, sir.

08:39.603 --> 08:41.730
Why would you need
to have our backs?

08:41.772 --> 08:43.899
You know, the borderline calls.

08:43.941 --> 08:44.900
Judgment calls.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.027
That could go either way.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.862
At the end of the day,

08:48.904 --> 08:52.449
what's the line
between simple and aggravated?

08:52.491 --> 08:53.867
They don't know.
They haven't been out

08:53.909 --> 08:55.452
in the real world in years.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.704
-(chuckles) Decades.
-Yes, sir.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.375
-It's easy for them to pass
judgment after the fact.
-Eh.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.169
Just want all my lieutenants

15:34.309 --> 15:35.310
Independent.

15:35.352 --> 15:38.772
Blue is for police.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.817
You are aware police chiefs
have not had much success

15:42.859 --> 15:43.902
as mayoral candidates.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.279
And what about Tom Bradley?

15:46.321 --> 15:47.822
Bradley was never a chief.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.407
He was a cop.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.192
Great. Send him in.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.116
-CHANDLER: Hector.
-Today's headline.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.951
Let's have it.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.621
Rita Tedesco was the court
reporter at Borders' trial.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.958
That's how they met?
How romantic.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.419
She probably believed his rap
about being framed by the cops,

16:42.460 --> 16:44.254
or whatever.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.047
-Still in Judge Sobel's
courtroom?
-Saw her yesterday.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.799
Braced her after work.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.968
She denied it,
but then she let it slip.

16:50.009 --> 16:54.389
There was no money.
Not yet.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.516
Common knowledge around the
courthouse they're married?

16:56.558 --> 16:58.226
No, mm-mm.
She kept it quiet.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.478
You probably don't want to tell
the judge you work for

17:00.520 --> 17:02.105
you married a guy she put away
for life.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.940
I mean, as his wife,

17:03.982 --> 17:06.568
she has unlimited visitation,
phone rights.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.153
So she's got to be
the go-between.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.196
Borders to Cronyn,
Cronyn to Borders.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.742
Okay, I'm on it.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.104
♪ ♪

18:09.172 --> 18:11.174
♪ ♪

18:21.392 --> 18:23.394
(insects trilling)

18:33.363 --> 18:36.407
Join you?

18:36.449 --> 18:39.118
Of course.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.589
Heard from Reggie?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.258
We Skyped the other day.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.844
He's in good spirits.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.763
Good.

18:58.805 --> 19:01.349
The rape case I took notes on?

19:01.391 --> 19:06.479
I saw her today at Grand Park.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.527
I wanted to say something
to her, talk to her.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.696
She didn't.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.198
She made that very clear.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.242
You get why.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.703
Of course, but...

19:21.744 --> 19:23.538
I still feel like

19:23.580 --> 19:25.999
I kind of understand
what she's going through.

19:26.040 --> 19:27.375
You might, you might not.

19:27.417 --> 19:30.044
Dangerous to presume.

19:30.086 --> 19:32.005
I know.

19:34.591 --> 19:37.051
At the prep session it came up
that she might cry

19:37.093 --> 19:39.512
while on the stand, you know?

19:39.554 --> 19:43.391
She said no, she wouldn't.

19:43.433 --> 19:47.145
Absolutely not.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.147
All cried out.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.317
You find that hard to believe?

19:52.358 --> 19:56.404
It could make a difference...
to the jury.

19:56.446 --> 20:01.451
Never know what's gonna move
a jury or leave 'em cold.

20:01.492 --> 20:05.163
-No guarantees.
-Nope.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.789
Seems so random.

20:06.831 --> 20:09.959
Even if you do get your day
in court.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.170
Remember that
Martin Luther King quote?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.588
Which one?

20:13.630 --> 20:17.091
The one you used in
your history paper, senior year.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.220
"The arc of the moral universe
is long,

20:21.262 --> 20:24.599
but it bends toward justice."

20:24.641 --> 20:26.517
You believe that?

20:26.559 --> 20:28.853
I do.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.022
Sometimes.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.326
(dog barks in distance)

20:49.415 --> 20:51.417
(gate slides open)

21:21.531 --> 21:24.033
So, Ballistics confirms
one of the guns

21:24.075 --> 21:27.078
from your pharmacy murder
killed my carjack victim.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.039
A wit saw these two guys
dump my vic's Buick.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.624
Rules out the van driver.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.376
Those are our two shooters.
Great work, brother.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.503
Where are we on Junior?

21:35.545 --> 21:38.423
Borrowed a car, bound for his
cousin's in Bakersfield.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.341
Reached out to Bakersfield PD,

21:40.383 --> 21:41.801
asked 'em to skee
the cousin's place.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.219
They'll call.

21:43.261 --> 21:44.971
Do we want to bring in
Narcotics?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.056
Let 'em bust the pill mill
after we're done.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.726
Roger that.
All right, thank you all.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.022
What's up?

21:54.063 --> 21:55.523
Late lunch with Barrel.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.858
-Round two.
-His request.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.818
-What could go wrong?
-Hmm.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.114
-MAN: Don't shoot me!
-OFFICER: Sir, nobody wants
to shoot you, okay?

22:03.156 --> 22:04.532
-MAN: Don't shoot me.
-OFFICER 2: Keep your hands

22:04.574 --> 22:05.658
-where we can see them!
-OFFICER: Just stay cool.

22:05.700 --> 22:06.659
MAN:
Let me just--

22:06.701 --> 22:08.202
-Let me just sh...
-(gunfire)

22:08.244 --> 22:09.412
-OFFICER: Down! Down! Down!
-OFFICER 2: Shit.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.289
Good shoot.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.707
-It's righteous.
-(video replaying)

22:12.749 --> 22:14.959
That looks like a pipe to me.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.252
In slo-mo, maybe.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.046
-MAN: Let me just sh...
-OFFICER: Down! Down! Down!

22:18.087 --> 22:19.547
RODRIGUEZ:
And why does he reach for it?

22:19.589 --> 22:21.716
Huh? What's that about,
a pipe in his pants?

22:21.758 --> 22:25.011
(chuckles)
They use 'em for fireworks.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.055
I see him reach for metal, boom.

22:27.096 --> 22:28.431
Looks like a gun to me, too.

22:28.473 --> 22:29.766
I would have fired.

22:29.807 --> 22:32.769
Edge taps twice,
Sloan doesn't even draw.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.313
Robson drained his piece.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.898
That's a problem.

22:36.939 --> 22:38.608
Yeah, well,
people who hate cops,

22:38.649 --> 22:40.693
they'll see what they
expect to see.

22:40.735 --> 22:42.445
Sometimes they're right.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.113
Not too fucking often.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.660
According to her data,
I'm a shoo-in.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.038
What do you think?

22:52.080 --> 22:53.998
That I've been chief
for just a year and a half,

22:54.040 --> 22:55.500
and have a great deal left
to accomplish.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.210
And no doubt you will.

22:57.251 --> 23:00.379
But couldn't you accomplish
even more as mayor?

23:00.421 --> 23:04.592
Does that ever happen
in the real world?

23:04.634 --> 23:07.011
Maybe not.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.014
I think it's a common delusion.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.643
When opportunity knocks,

23:13.684 --> 23:15.645
I like to peek out the window

23:15.686 --> 23:17.939
before I decide
either to open the door

23:17.980 --> 23:20.066
or pretend I'm not home.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.528
I've peeked.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.238
Not home.

23:25.279 --> 23:26.656
(chuckles softly)

23:26.697 --> 23:27.949
We'll talk.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.245
Bye.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.051
Jerry.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.719
You got a sec?

23:48.761 --> 23:50.429
Nothing but time.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.434
Any news?

23:55.476 --> 23:56.811
No breaks yet.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.063
RHD is working the snitch angle.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.607
Makes sense to me.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.151
Yeah, given Gary's history.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.282
Tell me about Leimert Park.

24:09.323 --> 24:10.950
The home invasion.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.702
The three others went in.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.078
Gary stayed in the car.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.454
Lookout.

24:15.496 --> 24:16.664
He rolled on them.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.291
I made him.

24:18.332 --> 24:20.084
He was still a minor... kid.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.296
DA cut him some slack.

24:23.337 --> 24:26.591
And they're all out now.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.634
Maybe one of them saw Gary
talking to us?

24:28.676 --> 24:30.928
Or heard about it?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.346
Crossed my mind.

24:32.388 --> 24:34.265
There's something
I didn't tell you

24:34.307 --> 24:35.892
when I was here the other night.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.353
What's that?

24:39.395 --> 24:42.398
When Gary met with
Marcos and Arias that morning,

24:42.440 --> 24:45.109
they planned to meet up again
later on that day.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.530
They waited for him,
but he didn't show.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.783
We know why.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.496
Gary told them
he would bring Bo Jonas.

24:57.538 --> 24:59.457
You think Jonas killed him?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.460
I don't know.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.462
Gary worry about the crew
after they got out?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.047
I mean, could explain the gun.

25:06.088 --> 25:07.715
Said he didn't.

25:07.757 --> 25:09.467
He moved on,
figured they had, too.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.136
Maybe he believes it;
doesn't make it so.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.722
No.

25:14.764 --> 25:16.515
I'm gonna talk to them.

25:18.226 --> 25:21.729
Well, Natrell stays over
on Florence with his mama.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.564
Crosley became
a jailhouse preacher.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.525
Pastors a little
storefront church

25:26.567 --> 25:28.986
-in Hyde Park.
-New Testament Church of God?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.529
That's the one.

25:30.571 --> 25:31.822
Jonas?

25:31.864 --> 25:33.741
Hmm... no idea.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.201
You've been keeping tabs.

25:36.661 --> 25:39.163
My son dropped a dime on them.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.500
Forgive and forget, easy to say.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.919
(Dwight sighs)

25:56.180 --> 25:58.224
Man has a son.

25:58.266 --> 26:01.018
He gets a picture of who that
child might grow up to be.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.396
You do your best.

26:03.437 --> 26:06.232
All you can do
is walk alongside and pray.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.069
How are your boys?

26:10.111 --> 26:12.113
They're good.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.907
Keep 'em close.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.291
Okay,
greens are criminal trespass,

26:23.332 --> 26:26.335
yellow are Peeping Toms,
red's rapes.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.878
These are Borders and Olmer?

26:27.920 --> 26:29.588
Just Olmer.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.173
He was a busy boy back then.

26:31.215 --> 26:33.801
An escalation to murder
fits the profile.

26:33.843 --> 26:36.178
They never even looked at him.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.264
Tunnel vision.

26:38.306 --> 26:39.765
Unlike you.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.312
What's the purple one?

26:44.353 --> 26:45.438
Skyler murder.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.772
Borders.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.190
Or Olmer.

26:48.232 --> 26:51.444
Bosch always talks
about his hunches.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.362
Well, I've got mine.

26:53.404 --> 26:56.115
You'll have to tell me
about you and Bosch sometime.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.159
What the deal is
between the two of you.

26:59.994 --> 27:02.246
Olmer spent the last three
months of his life

27:02.288 --> 27:04.081
in the prison hospital.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.791
Cronyn was a frequent visitor.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.377
Well, if Borders and Cronyn
cooked up the confession,

27:08.419 --> 27:10.671
there must be a trail
of visits and phone calls.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.256
Uh, there was a go-between.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.466
Borders' wife.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.925
And Olmer's DNA?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.469
Planted.

27:16.510 --> 27:17.762
After the fact.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.473
(sighs)

27:22.183 --> 27:25.061
Assuming you're right...

27:25.102 --> 27:26.771
property room or lab?

27:26.812 --> 27:28.439
Property.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.274
Lab, too many variables.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.111
I'll get you video
of the evidence transfer.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.863
Okay, thanks, Chief.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.656
Keep me apprised.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.415
-(clanking)
-(music playing)

27:48.584 --> 27:51.045
(man grunts)

27:51.087 --> 27:53.714
(man panting)

27:53.756 --> 27:55.174
Darius Natrell?

27:55.216 --> 27:57.218
(Natrell breathing heavily)

28:00.096 --> 28:01.514
You know I am.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.183
Appreciate a few minutes
of your time.

28:04.225 --> 28:07.228
Already used that up.

28:07.269 --> 28:09.939
Living with your mama, right?

28:09.980 --> 28:12.441
Again, asking questions
you already know the answer to.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.693
Wasting my time.

28:16.654 --> 28:17.905
You hear about Gary Wise?

28:18.948 --> 28:20.658
You zero on me for that?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.910
Just go ask them other two guys.

28:22.952 --> 28:24.495
Leave me the fuck alone.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.289
Last time you saw Gary?

28:27.331 --> 28:29.250
Can't even remember,
so long ago.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.293
You want to talk,
get me a lawyer.

28:31.335 --> 28:34.046
You want to walk on my mama's
lawn, get a goddamn warrant.

28:34.088 --> 28:36.090
(music continues playing)

28:44.098 --> 28:46.100
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

28:47.977 --> 28:50.521
MAN (over P.A.): Guard detail,
report to intake processing.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.314
Guard detail...

28:55.317 --> 28:56.569
(laughs)

28:57.945 --> 29:00.156
Fuck this.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.449
Really?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.328
You know I don't
have to talk to you, Bosch.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.290
That's a fact.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.333
(chair scrapes)

29:13.752 --> 29:14.962
You look like shit.

29:15.004 --> 29:17.006
Trying to hurt my feelings?

29:18.507 --> 29:21.135
Time has not been kind.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.554
Been ticking away with you
inside a steel box,

29:23.596 --> 29:25.347
that's a plus.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.308
(sucks teeth)
You framed the wrong guy.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.601
You're a broken record.

29:30.519 --> 29:34.231
You know, me getting out
is just the first step.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.400
'Cause we're taking you down.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.110
"We"? What, you and your lawyer?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.906
I'm coming after your job.

29:41.947 --> 29:44.992
Your house.

29:45.034 --> 29:46.744
Your whole fucking career.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.914
You're gonna be washing
windshields at stoplights.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.166
And I'm gonna be a rich man.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.418
After I walk out of here,

29:54.460 --> 29:57.838
you're gonna watch
cell doors swing open

29:57.880 --> 30:00.841
in every fucking prison
in the state.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.719
And the men you put
inside going free.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.096
So this is you "not talking"?

30:06.138 --> 30:07.681
(scoffs)

30:10.559 --> 30:12.937
That necklace was never
in my house.

30:12.978 --> 30:14.146
You planted it.

30:15.189 --> 30:16.357
Where was it?

30:17.399 --> 30:18.984
Nice try.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.945
Let me ask you something.

30:20.986 --> 30:22.863
How'd you and Cronyn hook up?

30:22.905 --> 30:25.699
Did you take out an ad?

30:25.741 --> 30:27.743
"L-WOP Con seeks
lowlife attorney

30:27.785 --> 30:29.954
for desperate scam."

30:29.995 --> 30:31.539
(smacks gum)

30:31.580 --> 30:33.666
We done?

30:34.708 --> 30:39.630
No... had to be him.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.090
His plan.

30:41.131 --> 30:43.008
You would've put
the knife in, right?

30:43.050 --> 30:44.426
Knife?

30:44.468 --> 30:46.387
The one you used
to mutilate her.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.598
No idea what
you're talking about.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.602
Would have made the confession
more credible,

30:53.644 --> 30:55.062
but Cronyn fucked up.

30:55.104 --> 30:57.314
There's nothing
in Olmer's confession

30:57.356 --> 30:58.816
that isn't public knowledge.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.194
Well... oh, DNA, motherfucker.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.989
Cronyn fucked that up, too.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.616
And we're gonna blow that
out of the water at the hearing.

31:07.658 --> 31:10.119
It's gonna be long ride
for you back to Quentin.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.372
Bullshit.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.709
Tough engineering a scam
like this from a prison cell.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.794
You got to rely on other people.

31:18.836 --> 31:21.755
Your lawyer...

31:21.797 --> 31:23.966
your wife.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.093
Fuck's my wife
got to do with it?

31:28.095 --> 31:29.221
We got her on tape.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.359
You and Cronyn are gonna get
what you deserve,

31:42.401 --> 31:45.029
but Rita's going down
with you...

31:45.070 --> 31:46.905
and that's a shame.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.284
(knocks on door)

31:50.326 --> 31:52.328
(door beeps)

31:55.164 --> 31:57.166
You planted
that fucking pendant, Bosch.

31:59.209 --> 32:00.919
You know you did!

32:04.214 --> 32:06.675
BONNER: Well, the next time
you go to see him in Lancaster,

32:06.717 --> 32:09.261
let me know and I'll give you
a ride on my bike.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.930
So long as you don't mind
riding bitch.

32:11.972 --> 32:13.182
Go away.

32:13.223 --> 32:14.767
I'm not talking to you.

32:14.808 --> 32:18.312
Tell Pres I need money. Now.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.025
Hey. Look at me.

32:24.526 --> 32:26.779
My eyes, look at my eyes.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.658
Do I look like
I'm serious to you?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.159
Yeah.

32:32.201 --> 32:33.619
Good.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.792
Pres is a lucky man.

32:45.589 --> 32:46.840
Go away.

32:50.844 --> 32:52.346
Tell him.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.560
I'll be in touch...

32:58.602 --> 33:00.020
Rita.

33:10.364 --> 33:12.324
HINES:
Reactions are all over the map.

33:12.366 --> 33:14.868
-And your base?
-My base?

33:14.910 --> 33:17.371
Expects me to file...
make a statement.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.581
And it's the wrong statement
if you can't win.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.917
Well, I'm sure
if I explain the law

33:21.959 --> 33:23.919
and how release
of the footage taints

33:23.961 --> 33:26.380
the potential jury pool,
they'll understand.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.424
You can decline to file.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.135
Tell me how.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.970
If the Police Commission finds

33:33.011 --> 33:34.555
Office Robson acted
out of policy,

33:34.596 --> 33:37.641
let the city
handle the civil suit.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.476
And you'll do what?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.895
The department will handle
the officers.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.607
Serious discipline.

33:45.649 --> 33:49.069
Appropriate. You have my word.

33:56.577 --> 33:58.328
-(Darius chuckles)
-All right. Okay.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.621
Holler if you need anything.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.665
All right.

34:29.526 --> 34:32.279
Tell me that you've come
for salvation

34:32.321 --> 34:33.906
and it's just coincidence
that you're here

34:33.947 --> 34:35.908
just after Darius left.

34:35.949 --> 34:37.743
How you doing, Reverend?

34:37.785 --> 34:41.163
I'm right with the Lord,
Detective. You?

34:41.205 --> 34:42.748
I don't know.

34:42.790 --> 34:44.583
Haven't checked in
with him lately.

34:44.625 --> 34:48.337
You know, it wasn't us did
poor Gary Wise, rest his soul.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.547
We all just trying
to move on best we can.

34:50.589 --> 34:51.757
You move on?

34:51.799 --> 34:53.801
I did.

34:55.552 --> 34:57.513
No hard feelings?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.848
I wouldn't say that.

34:59.890 --> 35:01.850
Years of my life.

35:01.892 --> 35:05.521
But wasn't Gary Wise took them
from me. I did that to myself.

35:05.562 --> 35:08.065
You're repentant.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.775
The Good Lord was looking out
for me that night.

35:09.817 --> 35:11.360
Oh, yeah? How so?

35:11.401 --> 35:14.822
Nobody got hurt, thank God.

35:14.863 --> 35:18.242
Gary Wise,
he was the Lord's instrument.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.743
Prison opened our eyes.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.329
We knew what we were doing
was wrong.

35:22.371 --> 35:25.999
Tell me this:
why would we jeopardize

35:26.041 --> 35:30.629
our sweet, hard-won freedom
for the sour taste of revenge?

35:30.671 --> 35:32.798
Preaching suits you.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.633
Gary was just a kid.

35:34.675 --> 35:36.176
Y'all scared him
into giving us up.

35:36.218 --> 35:37.511
Maybe his conscience
bothered him.

35:37.553 --> 35:39.096
Maybe it did.

35:40.639 --> 35:43.600
You found God...

35:43.642 --> 35:45.227
Darius Natrell found you,

35:45.269 --> 35:47.020
but nobody can find Bo Jonas.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.690
Gary did.

35:49.731 --> 35:52.317
And you helped
bring them together.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.990
If you hear from Jonas.

35:58.031 --> 36:00.617
And why would I put him
in touch with you?

36:00.659 --> 36:04.037
I just want to talk to him.
Tell him that.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.296
(door opens, shuts)

36:12.337 --> 36:14.715
-He sounds paranoid.
-Borders craves control.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.926
Not driving this train is eating
him alive. He'll crack.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.429
We need to crack
how they planted Olmer's DNA

36:20.470 --> 36:23.265
-on that handkerchief.
-Been working on that.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.517
Property room video.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.769
Eh, I won't ask
where you got it.

36:27.811 --> 36:30.230
-Dirty cop?
-Dirty civilian.

36:35.569 --> 36:39.781
Couriers usually pick up
more than one box for testing.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.199
Well, which one's ours?

36:41.241 --> 36:43.535
You'll see.

36:43.577 --> 36:47.164
The tech unseals the box
at the lab, tests the evidence,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.166
reseals the box
with their own tape,

36:49.207 --> 36:51.835
signs the seal, sends it back.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.087
-Well, this all looks legit.
-By the book.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.423
I've watched this
a half a dozen times.

36:56.465 --> 36:59.968
-So why am I watching it now?
-I'll show you.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.352
Property's been running out
of storage room for years.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.811
They've been
consolidating evidence,

37:09.853 --> 37:11.730
all from the same case.

37:11.772 --> 37:14.149
Two old boxes into one new one.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.776
If one wants to swap out
a piece of evidence,

37:15.817 --> 37:18.946
this is the time and place
to do it.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.824
That look like
a 22-year-old box to you?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.468
Stolper's birthday.

37:41.510 --> 37:42.761
Save me a piece.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.398
Bob? Christina Henry.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.233
How's Shootin' Newton?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.319
(laughs softly)
What else is new?

37:59.361 --> 38:01.321
The more things change, right?

38:01.363 --> 38:03.323
Listen, you got a couple minutes
tomorrow morning?

38:03.365 --> 38:06.952
Need a friendly copper
to walk me into archives.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.620
I think she's starting
to understand

38:08.662 --> 38:10.622
-there's more gray area than...
-(knocking on door)

38:10.664 --> 38:14.084
Hang on. Come in.

38:16.878 --> 38:19.673
-Chief.
-Oh.

38:22.259 --> 38:23.802
Wash.

38:23.844 --> 38:26.596
Return it to archives
first thing in the morning.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.640
Yes, sir.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.437
Sorry.

38:33.478 --> 38:37.190
So anyway, yeah-- I, uh, I think
she'll announce it next week.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.326
Let me ask you, Lieutenant.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.662
You think I'm a good detective?

38:50.704 --> 38:55.208
Look. I think you're
a great detective.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.294
Then show me some respect.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.296
I'm sorry?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.423
Save the retirement speech.

39:01.465 --> 39:04.217
Skip the walk down memory lane.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.928
I'm there. I get it.

39:06.970 --> 39:09.306
I don't like it, but I get it.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.018
Let's just enjoy our lunch.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.648
How's the French dip?

39:18.690 --> 39:21.818
Better than Philippe's.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.945
But I do miss that purple egg.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.073
Bite?

39:26.114 --> 39:28.784
-Mm. No, I'm good.
-Hmm.

39:28.825 --> 39:32.746
You know, you'll never get Crate
to go along.

39:32.788 --> 39:34.039
Why not?

39:34.081 --> 39:36.291
He's got nothing else.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.878
(sighs)

39:39.920 --> 39:42.297
(phone ringing)

39:42.339 --> 39:44.341
Vega.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.385
Hey, Jackie,
what do you got for me?

39:51.223 --> 39:54.726
All right, can you, uh, keep
an eye on it for a day or two?

39:54.768 --> 39:56.061
Yeah, just another day or two.

39:56.103 --> 39:58.855
I'd appreciate it. Thanks.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.316
Bakersfield.

40:01.358 --> 40:03.151
No signs of life.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.737
Looks like the family's
out of town, so...

40:05.779 --> 40:10.242
House is dark,
no trace of Jose Jr. or his car.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.868
Maybe we should go up there.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.870
-I know you're dying to.
-Hmm.

40:13.912 --> 40:16.706
Could talk to Cousin Oscar
again first.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.710
They'll let us know
if anything changes up there.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.671
They check the utilities?

40:22.712 --> 40:24.589
Didn't mention it.

40:24.631 --> 40:27.384
Hotter than hinges in
Bakersfield right now.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.428
Junior's hiding in that house,
he'd pop the AC on.

40:49.322 --> 40:50.907
What took you?

40:50.949 --> 40:52.325
What do we got?

40:52.367 --> 40:53.743
Composites were useful for once.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.787
Welder across the way.

40:55.829 --> 40:57.497
Seen them in and out of here
a lot, last six weeks.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.332
-Recently?
-Not lately.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.168
But he did see a car
pull in here a couple days ago.

41:01.209 --> 41:02.878
Nissan Sentra, gray or silver.

41:02.919 --> 41:06.173
Ooh-ee. Hallelujah.
Harjo, Enochty.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.716
Get your gear
and let's pop the sucker.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.384
Don't we need a warrant?

41:12.846 --> 41:14.806
Exigency, son.

41:14.848 --> 41:17.434
Jose Esquivel Jr.
is still MIA, no?

41:17.475 --> 41:20.395
-Yeah.
-He could be in there, alive,

41:20.437 --> 41:22.439
-in the trunk of that car.
Am I right?
-Yeah.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.441
So we're gonna clear,

41:24.482 --> 41:27.527
confirm, back out,
then we'll get a warrant.

41:28.737 --> 41:31.740
I hear that. Billy Harjo?

41:40.624 --> 41:41.708
Clear in back.

41:41.750 --> 41:44.252
Lo and behold. The getaway car.

41:44.294 --> 41:46.504
No plates. Pop it.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.550
In case Junior's in there.

41:59.226 --> 42:01.978
That would've been
an early Christmas present.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.605
Okay, we're out.

42:03.647 --> 42:05.815
Sit on it, see who shows up.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.652
Come back with our warrant.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.697
Western Sandblast.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.115
Whatever they were doing
in here

42:14.157 --> 42:17.369
sure as shit wasn't
sandblasting.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.371
Track down the landlord.

42:19.412 --> 42:23.416
See if you can get a line
on his sandblasting tenants.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.092
You guys want some overtime?

42:32.133 --> 42:33.426
You buying dinner?

42:34.844 --> 42:36.846
I'll spring for takeout.

42:36.888 --> 42:38.390
Jinya Ramen?

42:38.431 --> 42:39.808
Go get it, I'll wait.

42:39.849 --> 42:43.311
-Bring back some change.
-No way.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.063
Bring it down.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.117
(jazz music playing)

43:04.874 --> 43:06.251
(tapping on counter)

43:06.293 --> 43:07.669
Detective.

43:07.711 --> 43:10.588
I'm the one who called.
Skyler box.

43:10.630 --> 43:14.509
I already pulled it. Just need
a signature and a thumb.

43:23.685 --> 43:26.980
Mm. Dig that.

43:27.022 --> 43:29.399
Do me a favor?
Put the box up on the counter

43:29.441 --> 43:30.859
where I can look at it.

43:38.241 --> 43:40.910
This from when it was opened
to test evidence?

43:40.952 --> 43:42.078
That's right.

43:42.120 --> 43:44.998
It's been consolidated.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.876
These older cases,
just taking up space.

43:47.917 --> 43:50.086
"Spencer."

43:50.128 --> 43:52.088
Did the combining?

43:52.130 --> 43:54.049
Terry Spencer.

43:54.090 --> 43:56.843
He was here a minute ago,
just walked in the back.

43:56.885 --> 43:58.845
You need to ask him something?

43:58.887 --> 44:01.931
Well, somebody said the lab
fucked up the seal.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.516
-Looks clean to me.
-That it does.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.977
-Need to open it?
-Nah.

44:06.019 --> 44:09.022
-Thanks. Keep swinging, brother.
-All right.

44:14.903 --> 44:16.321
From this point
right here, guys.

44:16.363 --> 44:19.032
-Oh!
-That's better than nothing.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.326
(laughs)

44:21.368 --> 44:24.329
-Oh!
-That's not the backboard.

44:24.371 --> 44:26.498
-(laughter)
-You got to try and find that.

44:26.539 --> 44:28.541
All right.

44:31.294 --> 44:34.839
-(chuckles)
-Nice shot.

44:39.052 --> 44:41.346
Come on, brother.

44:44.724 --> 44:46.726
Come on, real.

44:54.109 --> 44:56.111

45:18.967 --> 45:20.677
