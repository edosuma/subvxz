WEBVTT

00:12.763 --> 00:14.598
I've never been happier.

00:14.598 --> 00:17.017
Being here with you
is everything to me.

00:17.017 --> 00:17.976
‐ Me too.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.854
We've got each other,
the sunset, a waterfall‐‐

00:20.854 --> 00:22.147
Wait, waterfall.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.398
Water. Fish.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.609
I'm supposed to be fishing
with Dawn right now!

00:25.609 --> 00:26.652
Gotta go!

00:29.738 --> 00:31.198
‐ Okay, I'll wait here.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.329
‐ Dawn, I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.413
I was‐‐
‐ With Guy.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.082
I know. It happens.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.250
It also happened yesterday.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.501
And the day before that.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.961
Oh, and the day before that.

00:43.961 --> 00:44.837
But it's okay.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.505
I guess that's just how friendship works?

00:46.505 --> 00:49.007
‐ No. Friends make time for each other,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.093
and I haven't been making
enough time for you.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.345
So tomorrow we're going on a picnic.

00:53.345 --> 00:54.388
Just you and me.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.473
‐ A picnic? Yes!

00:56.473 --> 00:57.724
But what about Guy?

00:57.724 --> 00:58.892
‐ Oh, he'll understand.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.269
I bet he won't even miss me.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.729
‐ I wonder when Eep's coming back.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.056
‐ I'm all packed for our picnic!

01:38.056 --> 01:40.893
I got bowls, a blanket, fire.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.061
‐ Maybe we make the fire
when we get there.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.813
‐ Aah!

01:46.815 --> 01:47.774
Unh!

01:47.774 --> 01:50.360
Right, right. This is gonna be a blast.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.528
It's just the two of us.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.989
And I am so pumped for our picnic!

01:53.989 --> 01:55.657
‐ Picnic? Just the three of us?

01:55.657 --> 01:56.742
Sounds great!

01:56.742 --> 01:58.327
I'll make pigators in a blanket.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.829
Whoo! I am pumped for our picnic!

02:00.829 --> 02:01.747
‐ Don't worry.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.208
I'll go tell Guy
the picnic is just you and me.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.501
‐ No, it's okay.

02:05.501 --> 02:06.627
We'll still be together.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.544
That's what matters.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.297
‐ Greetings, potential unpaid labor.

02:10.297 --> 02:14.426
Who among you craves the satisfaction
of a job well done

02:14.426 --> 02:15.969
and a life well lived?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.722
‐ Ooh! I want those things,
whatever they are.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.681
‐ And you can have them

02:19.681 --> 02:24.520
if you are able to rise to the challenge
of helping me dig our new well.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.397
‐ Digging, dirt, darkness? Done!

02:27.397 --> 02:30.943
‐ Excellent. Who else wants a slice
of subterranean glory?

02:30.943 --> 02:31.902
Hope? Ugga?

02:31.902 --> 02:34.154
‐ Nope. I remember the last well.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.198
Phil! Get me out of here!

02:36.198 --> 02:37.032
‐ Of course, dear.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.367
As soon as we're done digging.

02:38.367 --> 02:39.034
Phil!

02:39.034 --> 02:41.537
‐ But this is a brave new well.

02:41.537 --> 02:43.413
For water. The source of all life.

02:43.413 --> 02:46.333
‐ Sorry, Phil. I'm teaching Ugga
how to meditate instead.

02:46.333 --> 02:46.959
‐ You are?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.544
‐ Better than digging. Go with it.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.587
‐ Very well. Gran? Sandy?

02:54.216 --> 02:55.551
Okay. Thunk?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.223
‐ Ow!

03:01.223 --> 03:02.432
Ugh. Never mind.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.102
Guess it's you and me,
you mouth‐breathing mountain of muscle.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.812
‐ Or it's just me.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.105
I'll dig the well alone.

03:08.105 --> 03:08.897
I know holes.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.066
‐ Oh, no. I'll be with you
every step of the way.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.359
‐ Yeah, no, thanks.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.318
I dig alone.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.070
‐ As I supervise.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.071
Dig it or leave it.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.575
‐ Fine! But I'm digging my way.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.660
‐ As long as your way is my way.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.496
‐ So you've never raced chicken seals?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.456
‐ Race a chicken seal?

03:26.456 --> 03:27.749
You've met my parents, right?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.793
‐ Well, then we just won't tell them.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.712
‐ It'll be our little secret.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.880
Unless your parents torture me.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.549
I'll hold out as long as I can
but we all have our breaking point.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.758
Sorry, you were saying?

03:41.805 --> 03:42.973
‐ I'm starving.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.516
But I can't decide what to eat first,

03:44.516 --> 03:47.060
berrynut sandwich
or nutberry sandwich.

03:47.060 --> 03:47.853
‐ That's easy.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.189
We start with dessert,
your mom's dessert.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.106
‐ But she said,

03:51.106 --> 03:52.608
"Don't take my dessert!"

03:52.608 --> 03:53.567
‐ Ohh!

03:53.567 --> 03:54.776
All I heard was,

03:54.776 --> 03:55.903
"Take my dessert!"

03:58.530 --> 04:01.158
‐ Or we start with pigators
in a blanket.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.911
‐ Ah! Aah.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.953
Ugh!

04:06.163 --> 04:08.332
‐ Dessert it is!

04:12.002 --> 04:14.087
Grug, you're not a burrowing beast!

04:14.087 --> 04:14.880
You're a man!

04:14.880 --> 04:15.797
In theory.

04:15.797 --> 04:17.132
Use a shovel!

04:17.132 --> 04:19.676
‐ I use hands! You use a shovel!

04:19.676 --> 04:20.552
‐ Very well.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.596
I'll show you how a man digs

04:22.596 --> 04:24.014
while you tend the vine up here.

04:24.014 --> 04:24.973
I'm coming down.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.683
‐ Down? You got it!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.729
‐ Favorite sound.

04:31.230 --> 04:32.356
Ooh. I know.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.066
Birds chirping in the morning.

04:34.066 --> 04:34.900
‐ Nice!

04:34.900 --> 04:37.319
Mine is the first thundercrack of a storm.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.154
‐ Mine is‐‐ Whoa!

04:40.572 --> 04:42.950
A branch breaking my fall. I'm good.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.035
You've never seen a volcano erupt?

04:45.035 --> 04:47.037
‐ No, we always ran for our lives.

04:47.037 --> 04:48.080
Got room for more?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.624
Whoa!
‐ Oops.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.750
Too heavy. Sorry.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.960
Chunky, off the tight vine.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.586
‐ No, wait‐‐

04:54.586 --> 04:55.504
‐ Oops. Heh.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.755
Sorry again.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.468
‐ Can I tell you something
I've never told anyone else before?

05:01.468 --> 05:03.053
‐ Yes, please! Spill it.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.012
‐ Okay.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.014
‐ Catch? I'm in. Toss it here.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.602
Hmm? Hmm?
‐ Uh, Guy, can I talk to you?

05:11.687 --> 05:15.232
Sometimes people who like each other
spend all their time together.

05:15.232 --> 05:15.983
‐ Right.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.235
‐ But, sometimes, those same people

05:18.235 --> 05:20.529
wanna spend time with other people
who also like each other.

05:20.529 --> 05:21.071
‐ Right.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.364
‐ So you get what I'm saying?

05:22.364 --> 05:23.073
‐ Yes.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.325
The three of us
going on this picnic was a great idea.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.159
‐ No.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.496
I'm saying, sometimes,
I wanna hang out with Dawn.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.205
Alone.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.499
‐ Right. Alone. Just the three of us.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.418
‐ No. Just the two of us.

05:34.418 --> 05:36.461
‐ You and me?
Wait, but what about Dawn?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.963
‐ Guy, you're not hearing me.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.257
This picnic was supposed to be
just Dawn and me.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.925
We're trying to get to know
each other better.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.261
So I'm asking you to leave.

05:50.642 --> 05:51.476
‐ Totally get it.

05:51.476 --> 05:52.603
Couldn't agree with you more.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.313
You need time with your new friend

05:54.313 --> 05:56.315
and I need time to make new friends.

05:56.315 --> 05:57.858
I'm glad you said something.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.986
This is healthy and... healthy.

06:00.986 --> 06:01.653
‐ So we're good?

06:01.653 --> 06:03.447
‐ Good? We're better than good.

06:03.447 --> 06:04.114
Never been better.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.075
I wish I could stay and keep talking
about how great we are,

06:07.075 --> 06:09.328
but, whew, I gotta go and hang with

06:10.162 --> 06:11.246
someone else.

06:12.873 --> 06:13.832
‐ That went great.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.876
Hey, Dawn, ball! And spill it!

06:21.089 --> 06:23.217
‐ Okay, I know you and I don't know
each other that well,

06:23.217 --> 06:24.676
but I'd like to change that.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.470
So, wanna hang out?

06:28.222 --> 06:29.681
And you have other plans.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.266
Grug, pay attention.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.811
Push, scoop, throw.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.272
Push, scoop, throw!

06:37.272 --> 06:39.608
And that's how you dig.
Understood?

06:39.608 --> 06:41.610
Throw, scoop, whatever.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.362
No, that's all wrong!

06:43.362 --> 06:45.864
Pull me up so I can properly berate you.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.536
Steady the vine, you human boulder!

06:50.536 --> 06:51.245
‐ Steady?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.621
You mean like this?

06:53.622 --> 06:54.456
‐ No!

06:54.456 --> 06:56.375
Not... like... that!

06:56.875 --> 06:57.793
‐ Hey, Grug.

06:57.793 --> 06:58.460
Busy?

06:58.460 --> 06:59.461
‐ Not busy at all.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.380
Grug, be less useless.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.677
‐ Okay, this is a new one, but, um,

07:06.677 --> 07:08.303
wanna hang out?

07:08.303 --> 07:09.888
As, uh, friends?

07:09.888 --> 07:10.681
I know it's‐‐
‐ Yes!

07:10.681 --> 07:11.849
‐ Really? Are you sure?

07:11.849 --> 07:13.475
‐ Sure. Why wouldn't I be sure?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.602
‐ Uh, 'cause I'm dating your daughter
and you hate it?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.358
Boop.
‐ Boop.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.651
Grug!

07:22.651 --> 07:24.695
Stop growling and start learning!

07:24.695 --> 07:28.031
‐ If hanging out with you
means I'm not listening to Phil, I'm in.

07:28.031 --> 07:28.907
‐ Great.

07:31.577 --> 07:33.912
So, uh, you like rocks?

07:34.913 --> 07:35.789
‐ Rocks?

07:38.083 --> 07:39.168
I‐I guess.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.845
And you?

07:50.512 --> 07:51.430
You‐you like rocks?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.556
‐ Uh, sure.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.724
Rocks are good.

07:53.724 --> 07:54.600
So‐‐

07:55.142 --> 07:56.393
Rocks.

07:58.937 --> 07:59.897
‐ Yeah.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.106
Rocks.

08:17.915 --> 08:18.790
Grug?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.709
Why aren't you gently pulling me up?

08:20.709 --> 08:23.086
Is your primitive mind
unable to hear my thoughts?

08:23.086 --> 08:24.546
‐ Whew, saved by the well. Heh.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.966
‐ I... said... gently!

08:31.011 --> 08:32.763
More useless shiny rocks.

08:32.763 --> 08:34.389
Oh. Hey, Guy.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.766
Change your mind
about helping with the well?

08:35.766 --> 08:38.268
All's well that digs well.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.271
‐ Ooh! Guy, you want a friend,
so, how about Phil?

08:41.271 --> 08:44.316
He can teach you about shovels
while I dig. Here.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.445
Whoa.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.113
Guy really got some air.

08:50.113 --> 08:50.739
Grug!

08:50.739 --> 08:52.241
Repeat after me.

08:52.241 --> 08:55.869
Push, scoop, throw!

08:57.371 --> 08:59.081
‐ Just empty your mind

08:59.081 --> 09:00.874
and think of your happy place.

09:00.874 --> 09:01.792
‐ Okay, which one?

09:01.792 --> 09:02.960
Empty my mind or think?

09:07.256 --> 09:09.299
Whoa. Guy. Are you okay?

09:09.299 --> 09:10.300
‐ Yeah. Yeah.

09:10.300 --> 09:12.803
That‐that landing was less painful

09:12.803 --> 09:14.054
than trying to hang out with Grug.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.764
‐ Beats digging a well with Phil.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.350
Now, if you don't mind,
you're interrupting our meditation.

09:18.350 --> 09:21.019
‐ Empty mind, happy place, Hope.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.771
And, Guy, why were you
hanging out with Grug?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.982
I thought you were on a picnic
with Eep and Dawn.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.233
‐ Yeah, I was.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.862
But you know what they say,
two's company, three's also company.

09:29.862 --> 09:31.530
So... wanna hang out?

09:32.948 --> 09:34.616
I mean, Eep and Dawn are new friends.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.577
They need time to get to know each other.

09:36.577 --> 09:37.953
And I don't wanna spoil that.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.204
Friendship is like a flower.

09:39.204 --> 09:39.997
It's beautiful.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.915
But it needs time to grow and blossom.

09:41.915 --> 09:44.668
Sometimes it has thorns,
like one of those‐those thor‐‐

09:44.668 --> 09:45.794
‐ Empty your mind!

09:49.423 --> 09:50.757
‐ Oh, there's Gran and Sandy.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.592
I'm just gonna‐‐

09:56.305 --> 09:57.306
Hello?

09:57.306 --> 09:58.515
Hel‐l‐lo?

09:58.515 --> 10:00.684
Gran? Sandy?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.941
‐ Easy, Sandy.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.026
He's a friendly.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.446
What're you doing in the hot zone, Guy?

10:12.446 --> 10:13.655
We're on the hunt.

10:13.655 --> 10:16.033
You almost got your head taken off.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.951
‐ Well, I‐I was in the area,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.786
and I thought you might wanna hang out.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.579
Ahh!

10:20.579 --> 10:22.164
‐ What's your angle?

10:23.332 --> 10:24.082
‐ Friendship?

10:25.459 --> 10:27.044
‐ Friendship, huh?

10:27.044 --> 10:30.047
Normally, I'd say
friends are for the weak!

10:30.047 --> 10:32.508
But prey is a little light today,

10:32.508 --> 10:34.676
so how'd you like to train with us?

10:34.676 --> 10:36.220
‐ Really? Sure.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.221
I'd love to.

10:38.931 --> 10:42.768
Um, when you said training,
this isn't what I had in mind.

10:42.768 --> 10:46.522
I was thinking push‐ups,
maybe squats, you know.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.732
So, I'm just gonna... go!

10:54.738 --> 10:56.073
Last chance, Guy.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.199
Make it count.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.661
Hey, Thunk. Watching window, huh?

11:03.539 --> 11:07.376
Yeah. So, I was thinking
maybe you and I could hang out.

11:07.376 --> 11:08.293
What do you say?

11:10.170 --> 11:10.712
Thunk?

11:20.264 --> 11:21.390
‐ Oh!

11:21.390 --> 11:22.224
Hey, Guy.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.518
I'm watching Rhimotheros on window.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.853
It's riveting.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.603
Wanna watch?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.021
‐ Uh... sure.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.277
What are we watching again?

11:33.277 --> 11:34.862
‐ Rhimotheros.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.447
This is the build up to the big ending.

11:41.577 --> 11:42.744
‐ I'm not seeing anything.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.954
‐ Watch the cocoon.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.043
‐ Or we can go have some fun outside.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.545
‐ Outside? Why?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.463
‐ Fresh air, adventure, even danger.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.756
Come on, buddy, you'll love it.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.425
Danger? Why would I love danger?

12:00.512 --> 12:04.933
‐ I see the term "gently" has finally
penetrated your rock‐hard skull.

12:04.933 --> 12:08.312
But I'm not sure
you're quite ready to dig just yet.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.650
You did that on purpose.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.069
Now if you're done
with your juvenile ant‐‐

12:17.029 --> 12:18.697
Don't you ever‐‐

12:19.823 --> 12:20.991
Don't‐‐

12:20.991 --> 12:22.910
Cease your vine‐foolery at once!

12:22.910 --> 12:24.036
‐ Hey, you got it.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.163
'Cause I can dig anywhere. Alone.

12:26.788 --> 12:27.831
‐ As you wish.

12:27.831 --> 12:28.832
But don't release the‐‐

12:32.878 --> 12:34.296
‐ Eep and I love doing this.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.924
Makes that thing in your chest thump
in a good way, huh, Thunk?

12:36.924 --> 12:39.718
‐ No, no, this is bad thumping! Bad!

12:40.552 --> 12:42.513
‐ Just wait till we reach the top, bud.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.306
‐ The top?

12:44.306 --> 12:46.350
‐ Thunk, you're still on the ground.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.315
Ready to jump?

12:53.315 --> 12:54.358
‐ Jump? I'm not gonna‐‐

12:55.234 --> 12:56.443
‐ That's it, buddy.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.320
Sweet jump! Whoo!

13:01.865 --> 13:03.116
You feeling better, Thunk?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.452
‐ Yeah. I'm‐I'm better than
when the waterfall you took me to

13:05.452 --> 13:06.495
almost killed me.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.413
‐ Great! So I can put you down now?

13:08.413 --> 13:09.498
‐ Hmm, not yet.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.582
You can't be too careful.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.212
‐ Ah! I won!

13:15.212 --> 13:16.713
‐ Because I let you win.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.925
‐ Or did I let you lose?

13:19.925 --> 13:20.676
‐ What?

13:20.676 --> 13:21.885
‐ Oh, hey, Guy.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.096
Uh, is Thunk okay?

13:24.096 --> 13:25.556
‐ You mean my good buddy Thunk?

13:25.556 --> 13:26.890
He's better than okay.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.766
He's the best!

13:27.766 --> 13:30.727
‐ Yes! I love that
you and Thunk are hanging out.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.229
But why are you carrying him?

13:32.229 --> 13:34.690
‐ Uh, we're just playing buddy carry.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.441
It's a fun game that's real.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.443
That buddies play.
That I didn't just make up right now.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.321
‐ Really? I thought you were carrying me
because I fell off a waterfall.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.198
‐ Ha! That‐‐ Uh‐‐

13:43.198 --> 13:45.534
That's a good one, uh, T‐Bone.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.412
Yeah, we're always joking around,
giving each other nicknames.

13:48.412 --> 13:49.580
The‐the way buddies do.

13:49.580 --> 13:50.831
‐ Who's T‐Bone?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.458
Guy, uh, do you not
know my name? It's Thunk.

13:53.458 --> 13:54.751
‐ Love it.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.004
The‐the fun never stops with T‐Bone.

13:57.004 --> 13:59.840
In fact, we were just about
to race chicken seals.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.258
‐ Ooh! Really?

14:01.258 --> 14:03.010
Awesome! It's like you're making
a whole new Thunk.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.803
‐ No, he's not, and no, I'm not!

14:04.803 --> 14:06.263
‐ Sure, I am, and sure you are!

14:09.766 --> 14:11.685
Oh, no.
‐ Wow!

14:11.685 --> 14:13.061
He's racing backwards!

14:13.061 --> 14:14.354
Did you teach him that, Guy?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.231
‐ No. That's all T‐Bone.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.608
Anything for a laugh.

14:17.608 --> 14:18.984
Wait up, T‐Bone!

14:18.984 --> 14:20.235
I'm right behind you!

14:23.447 --> 14:24.698
T‐Bone!

14:26.533 --> 14:27.993
Hello?

14:28.994 --> 14:29.661
PHIL'Hello?

14:30.787 --> 14:34.041
‐ Okay, that was an echo,
not a voice in my head.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.210
Easy, Phil. Keep it together.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.384
‐ Couch sweet couch.

14:44.384 --> 14:48.347
‐ Yeah. Sorry I dragged you outside
to do stuff I wanted to do.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.556
That's not a good hang.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.559
Anyway, I'm gonna go
and let you get back to your window.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.478
‐ What? No way, Guy.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.188
Head‐Face‐Man.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.439
Sorry.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.524
I'm bad at nicknames.

14:58.524 --> 15:00.984
Uh, grab some couch
for the big Rhimotheros ending.

15:00.984 --> 15:01.652
‐ You sure?

15:01.652 --> 15:03.445
‐ Sure as the world is flat.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.114
‐ Sure. Great. Let's do this!

15:07.491 --> 15:10.619
Whoa. Did that cocoon just move?

15:10.619 --> 15:12.454
‐ Oh‐ho! Strap in.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.665
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

15:14.665 --> 15:15.707
Banana chip?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.632
‐ A friendship crown for you.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.513
‐ And here's mine for you.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.807
Sorry, I'm not very good at crafts.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.142
‐ What, are you kidding? This is the best!

15:34.142 --> 15:37.896
‐ Yeah. But watching Thunk
ride a chicken seal was a close second.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.773
You know, I'm glad
Thunk and Guy are hanging out.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.774
They make a good pair.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.401
‐ Do they? They're so different.

15:42.401 --> 15:44.653
Not as different as Guy and your Dad.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.572
Guy took a swing at that today, too.

15:46.572 --> 15:49.199
‐ Really? 'Cause Dad's usually
taking a swing at Guy.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.412
Dad, drop the club!

15:53.412 --> 15:55.873
‐ Guy's been trying to find
a new friend all day.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.207
Thunk's the only one that stuck.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.459
‐ So that's why
Guy and Thunk are hanging out.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.212
I mean, Guy and Thunk go together
like Thunk and running.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.297
‐ Or Thunk and walking.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.798
‐ Or Thunk and standing up.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.092
‐ But why was Guy so eager
to find a new friend?

16:07.092 --> 16:09.845
‐ I don't know. All Eep did was tell him
to get lost and leave us alone.

16:09.845 --> 16:10.971
‐ That's not what I said.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.764
‐ Right, I'm sure you said it nicely.

16:12.764 --> 16:15.309
‐ Eep, Guy didn't have anyone
till he met you.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.978
‐ But now you have Dawn
and he's back to having no one.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.188
‐ Ooh. What about Thunk?

16:19.188 --> 16:20.522
‐ Thunk's not you.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.774
‐ Yeah. Guy didn't give
his heart to Thunk.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.234
He gave it to you.

16:29.198 --> 16:30.616
I wanted us to hang out.

16:30.616 --> 16:31.867
But I didn't want Guy to get hurt.

16:31.867 --> 16:33.452
‐ Well, I didn't mean to hurt him!

16:33.452 --> 16:35.120
But... I did.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.665
Because I wasn't honest with him
about my picnic with Dawn from the start.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.083
‐ Maybe you should tell him that.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.502
‐ If it's not too late.

16:41.502 --> 16:43.378
‐ But Dawn and I are hanging out.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.214
‐ Don't worry about me, Eep.

16:45.214 --> 16:48.342
Go to him. Go to Guy.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.427
‐ I will. I will!

16:50.427 --> 16:52.095
I'm coming for you, Guy!

16:52.763 --> 16:54.431
You were right.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.141
Rhimotheros is amazing.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.476
I can't stop watching.

16:57.476 --> 16:58.310
‐ Pace yourself.

16:58.310 --> 17:00.479
The good stuff starts at sunset.

17:00.479 --> 17:01.605
‐ Good stuff? Like what?

17:01.605 --> 17:04.066
‐ Oh, no, no. No spoilers.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.943
You just have to watch.

17:05.943 --> 17:07.778
Hey, uh, want some more banana chips?

17:07.778 --> 17:08.695
‐ Sure.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.905
‐ Heh, heh. Cool.

17:09.905 --> 17:11.782
Go grab some for us, G‐Man.

17:11.782 --> 17:14.535
‐ You got me, T‐Bone.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.619
‐ Aw. I always got ya.

17:15.619 --> 17:17.037
'Cause that's what best friends do.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.300
‐ Hey, Guy‐Baby. I like your song.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.929
‐ Song? Uh, I wasn't singing to myself
'cause I thought I was alone.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.138
No. But you liked it?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.098
‐ Loved it.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.641
So, about this morning‐‐

17:37.641 --> 17:38.433
‐ Forget it.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.436
You and Dawn hanging out
means more Thunk and Guy time.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.771
We're basically inseparable.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.231
‐ Oh, good.

17:44.231 --> 17:47.150
Well, maybe we can
get together to talk later.

17:47.150 --> 17:47.776
‐ I'm in!

17:47.776 --> 17:48.527
‐ Great!

17:48.527 --> 17:49.486
And Thunk won't mind?

17:49.486 --> 17:51.029
‐ T‐bone? Nah.

17:51.029 --> 17:51.864
T‐bone's cool.

17:51.864 --> 17:54.074
‐ Perfect. So, waterfall? Sunset?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.369
‐ The good stuff starts at sunset.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.454
Sunset. Sunset.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.164
‐ Sunset's wide open. See you then.

18:01.164 --> 18:02.040
‐ Great.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.795
‐ 'Cause that's what best friends do.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.422
Do. Do.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.056
All is not lost.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.600
You'll get outta here, Phil.

18:19.600 --> 18:21.310
Just need to keep your wits about you.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.604
No reason to descend
into madness or anything.

18:23.604 --> 18:25.355
PHIL'
I agree, real Phil.

18:25.355 --> 18:28.233
If you start hallucinating,
you're finished.

18:35.574 --> 18:37.451
‐ Stupid screaming wells.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.540
‐ Huh?
‐ Push.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.083
‐ Huh?
‐ Scoop.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.251
Throw.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.430
‐ So, how much longer
until the good stuff happens?

18:58.430 --> 18:59.640
Soon to very soon?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.433
‐ Why? Do you have somewhere to go?

19:02.726 --> 19:04.728
‐ What? Me? Go?

19:04.728 --> 19:05.854
Somewhere? To meet Eep?

19:05.854 --> 19:06.855
That's crazy.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.023
Why would you even say that?

19:08.023 --> 19:09.566
‐ I, uh, I didn't.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.984
‐ Yeah, no, I know that.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.201
Be right back, T‐Bone.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.953
The banana chips are running low.

19:20.953 --> 19:23.121
‐ Wait. What do you mean?
The‐the bowl is full.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.122
‐ Right. Right.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.086
Oh, are these pillows lumpy?

19:29.086 --> 19:31.797
I'll go to the chicken seal coop
and get some more fresh feathers.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.341
‐ Forget the pillows.
You'll miss the good stuff.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.262
‐ Oh, there it is. The good stuff!

19:38.262 --> 19:40.806
You were right. That was quite a ride.

19:40.806 --> 19:41.765
Well, see you later, T‐Bone.

19:41.765 --> 19:43.725
‐ Hey, hey. That's not the good stuff.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.810
That was a leaf.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.564
Eep's waiting. I need an excuse.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.899
Wait. Leaf. Tree.

19:50.899 --> 19:51.900
Trees need water.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.402
Water comes from a well.

19:53.402 --> 19:53.986
The well!

19:53.986 --> 19:57.406
I just remembered I told Phil
I'd help with the well at sunset. Bye.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.032
‐ But you'll miss everything.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.118
‐ It's water. It's the source of all life.

20:01.118 --> 20:02.327
It can't wait.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.247
Forgot to grab these.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.707
You know, for the... for the well.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.213
Friendship crown for a friend?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.382
‐ How is it that everyone
can make these things except me?

20:15.382 --> 20:16.884
‐ It's okay. You made this picnic.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.844
‐ Just making up for our last picnic.

20:18.844 --> 20:20.345
I'm sorry, Guy.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.347
I should have told you
Dawn and I had plans.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.266
And I shouldn't have been rude to you.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.267
You deserved better.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.768
‐ Eh! I get it.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.811
Friends gotta friend.

20:27.811 --> 20:30.439
‐ Yeah, but there's no good reason
to hurt a friend.

20:31.064 --> 20:31.690
Banana chip?

20:32.649 --> 20:34.651
‐ Grab some for us, G‐Man.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.819
G‐Man.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.112
‐ I'm a bad friend!

20:37.112 --> 20:38.530
‐ What? What do you mean?

20:38.530 --> 20:41.033
‐ I ditched Thunk
so I could be here with you.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.576
I'm sorry, Thunk.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.535
I'm sorry!

20:43.535 --> 20:45.037
‐ It's cool, G‐man.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.038
‐ No, it's not!

20:46.038 --> 20:47.206
It's not cool at all!

20:47.206 --> 20:48.332
‐ Who are you talking to?

20:48.332 --> 20:50.792
‐ Uh, myself? Definitely myself.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.630
‐ Go to him. Go to Thunk.

20:55.047 --> 20:55.714
‐ I will.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.257
I will.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.842
I'm coming for you, T‐Bone!

21:10.020 --> 21:11.522
Rhimotheros!

21:11.522 --> 21:13.148
It's happening!

21:13.899 --> 21:15.609
Thank the stars!

21:15.609 --> 21:16.777
I'm saved!

21:17.277 --> 21:18.487
Hello?

21:18.487 --> 21:19.571
Is anyone there?

21:20.072 --> 21:21.532
Seriously?

21:28.413 --> 21:29.665
‐ Oh, no, you're crying.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.416
I'm sorry, Thunk. So sorry!

21:31.416 --> 21:33.919
I‐I left you so I could hang out with Eep.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.128
I'm a monster.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.965
‐ It's breathtaking.

21:38.382 --> 21:39.675
Isn't it?

21:41.093 --> 21:43.011
‐ Wait, you're crying about Rhimotheros?

21:43.011 --> 21:44.429
‐ Uh‐huh.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.974
And you're blocking the window.
If... if you don't mind.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.017
‐ So you forgive me for leaving?

21:49.017 --> 21:50.102
‐ You left?

21:50.102 --> 21:51.645
Oh, yeah, you left.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.437
Welcome back, buddy.

21:52.437 --> 21:55.357
‐ Buddy? I‐I just told you
I betrayed our friendship!

21:55.357 --> 21:57.150
‐ Hey, heh, it happens.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.695
Anyway, have a seat, G‐Man,
you're missing it.

22:18.547 --> 22:19.381
Wow!

22:19.381 --> 22:21.258
You were right, T‐Bone.

22:21.258 --> 22:22.843
This is the good stuff.

22:22.843 --> 22:25.220
‐ Nah, that's not the good stuff.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.977
Ooh, this is the good stuff, G‐Man!
