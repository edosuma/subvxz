WEBVTT

00:17.417 --> 00:19.458
-Ha.

00:22.667 --> 00:24.542
: Really, Connie?

00:24.583 --> 00:27.041
Do you think I'm blind

00:27.083 --> 00:29.041
-No. -Staring right at it.

00:29.083 --> 00:32.458
Right out in the open, not... What is going on here?

00:32.500 --> 00:35.750
You do not cheat in this class.

00:35.792 --> 00:39.125
Wow! You people have a lot of courage...

00:39.166 --> 00:42.291
To just cheat right out in the open like that.

00:42.333 --> 00:45.125
Not even trying to hide it. Who else has one of these?

00:45.166 --> 00:47.417
Hold it up. Oh great!

00:47.458 --> 00:51.208
The group cheat. Blatant! Blatant disrespect.

00:51.250 --> 00:54.333
What have I said about cheating? Cheaters never profit!

00:54.375 --> 00:57.667
You heard that saying before? One honest person, right here!

00:57.709 --> 01:01.000
Thank you Jordan. The only person not cheating.

01:01.041 --> 01:04.458
I will trust you forever! Do you understand how that works?

01:04.500 --> 01:06.625
This is what I think of cheaters, right here.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.792
There's a cheater. There's another cheater.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.959
Cheater, cheater, cheater. All of you.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.375
-Sir, you said we could have a cheat sheet.

01:15.083 --> 01:18.750
-Let me just double check that. Did I say you could have a...

01:18.792 --> 01:21.417
I did say you could have a... Okay, okay. Alright.

01:21.458 --> 01:24.375
Pft. Ahh. Sometimes.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.542
Well you're not a good listener Jordan.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.709
That's what I got out of this conversation.

01:29.750 --> 01:32.709
Jordan doesn't listen. So, I guess when I'm up

01:29.750 --> 01:32.709
here talking everyday

01:32.750 --> 01:35.917
You're just like: "whoa, wow... Look at me...Nothing."

01:35.959 --> 01:37.834
Have fun writing that.

01:37.875 --> 01:40.041
-Yeah, sorry about that.

01:40.083 --> 01:44.500
There ya go, I just sort of divided it up into sections.

01:44.542 --> 01:47.166
Yeah, go get those. Go ahead.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.417
Yeah, great. Grab your cheat sheets.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.583
Good. You're allowed those.

01:51.625 --> 01:54.667
Let's go, hurry up people. We don't have all day here.

01:54.709 --> 01:58.250
Back to cheating, keep your eyes on your own cheat sheet please.

02:00.333 --> 02:03.041
♪ I'm awesome, no you're not dude, don't lie ♪

02:03.083 --> 02:05.667

02:13.375 --> 02:15.500
-Hey Mr. Duncan. Guess what!

02:15.542 --> 02:17.417
-I'd love to guess, Hayden, but ah...

02:17.458 --> 02:20.083
-My baseball team's playing tonight and I'd love it if you

02:17.458 --> 02:20.083
came.

02:20.125 --> 02:22.250
I can save you a seat in the bleachers!

02:22.291 --> 02:25.333
-Awww. -And what have I said about this

02:22.291 --> 02:25.333
before?

02:25.375 --> 02:27.709
-That if you go to my after school events,

02:27.750 --> 02:30.041
you have to go to every other kid's after school event.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.500
-That's what I keep saying. And I don't want to do that.

02:32.542 --> 02:35.125
I don't want to go to your events, any of them. Ever.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.333
I don't want to do stuff after school with you.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.709
I don't know how to make that sink in.

02:39.750 --> 02:42.917
So please stop asking me to do stuff with you.

02:42.959 --> 02:45.875
Please Thank you, bye.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.917
: Oh my God, that kid does not get it.

02:49.959 --> 02:52.959
-You know, normally I love watching you crush their little

02:49.959 --> 02:52.959
spirits.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.125
But you should go easier on Hayden right now.

02:55.166 --> 02:58.291
His dad's on his death bed.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.709
Why didn't you say that? -I didn't want to cut in.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.917
Anyway, yeah it's supposed to be happening soon.

03:02.959 --> 03:06.041
Like a matter of days or minutes. Could be happening now.

03:06.083 --> 03:08.083
Or now. -That's awful!

03:08.125 --> 03:09.959
-Yeah. -But I'm sorry, he's annoying!

03:10.000 --> 03:12.667
He's always asking me to do stuff. Do I want to play catch?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.834
I don't want to play catch with you after school.

03:14.875 --> 03:17.041
-That sounds sweet. -It's not sweet. It's needy!

03:17.083 --> 03:18.917
-Yeah. -And it's annoying and it's

03:17.083 --> 03:18.917
everyday.

03:18.959 --> 03:21.750
-Well more money for the rest of us, I guess.

03:21.792 --> 03:23.875
-Rumour has it that Hayden's favourite faculty members are

03:23.917 --> 03:25.959
gonna get a little sumpin-sumpin when his dad dies.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.500
-Oh my gosh! They're loaded! His dad's loaded!

03:28.542 --> 03:30.667
-I thought you said you've been blowing him off for years.

03:30.709 --> 03:33.000
-I know, but for some reason he keeps boomeranging back!

03:33.041 --> 03:35.000
-Well, money changes a lot of things.

03:35.041 --> 03:37.875
-He's not a bad kid, either. Like, if you...If you...

03:35.041 --> 03:37.875
That was a bad example.

03:37.917 --> 03:41.917
But if you've really like, get a chance to know him like I

03:37.917 --> 03:41.917
have a little bit.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.875
-Yeah. -I've gotta go to a game.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.875
I should go to a game.

03:43.917 --> 03:46.041
-Oh, I love going to little league games.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.917
Wear a hat, some sunglasses, slap on a moustache. It's like

03:46.083 --> 03:48.917
going undercover.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.375
-I don't think you should do that.

03:48.959 --> 03:51.375
-Yeah...

03:51.417 --> 03:53.542
I've been escorted off a couple of fields in my day.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.875
-Yup, I'm gonna... Stand.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.917
-So, I have a little news update.

04:02.959 --> 04:05.667
-As of today...

04:05.709 --> 04:09.500
Robert and I... Are co-principals.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.875
: Yeah, right.

04:13.917 --> 04:16.667
-Pandora's box, she is opened.

04:16.709 --> 04:18.834
-Seriously, you know it's for the best.

04:18.875 --> 04:21.208
You know? With the school expansion...

04:21.250 --> 04:25.041
The board probably thought it was too big a job, even for me.

04:25.083 --> 04:28.250
-Or, perhaps they lost confidence in you.

04:28.291 --> 04:30.792
After you almost burned down the school,

04:30.834 --> 04:34.083
got involved in a racially charged mishap with the

04:30.834 --> 04:34.083
chairman.

04:34.125 --> 04:36.250
And then married one of your staff.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.625
I guess we'll never know.

04:45.625 --> 04:47.875
-Oh, you know Robert.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.834
: Hayden!

05:25.875 --> 05:29.458
You left without telling me what time your game starts tonight.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.834
-Ah, but you said never to ask you again.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.000
-That's so us, that's what we do.

05:34.041 --> 05:38.166
You ask me to do something, I usually say no, get lost, I

05:34.041 --> 05:38.166
don't want to get outta my face.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.959
And that's the Duncan/Hayden banter. That's how it works.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.083
-That's us!

05:43.125 --> 05:46.166
-Well, the game starts at six, but if you're early we can have

05:43.125 --> 05:46.166
a catch.

05:46.208 --> 05:49.458
-Won't be early, won't be playing catch but I'll be there.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.250
-Okay, I'll see you tonight. -Tell your dad I'm gonna

05:49.500 --> 05:53.250
to be there. See ya!

05:53.291 --> 05:57.208
Okay, alright thanks! Hey! What position are you?

05:57.250 --> 06:00.917
-No, I don't play, I'm just there in case someone

05:57.250 --> 06:00.917
doesn't show up.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.834
-Yeah.

06:02.875 --> 06:06.000
-Okay, I'll come watch you sit on the bench. Alright, deal!

06:06.041 --> 06:08.083
-Okay!

06:08.959 --> 06:11.333
: Life is like double dutch.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.834
Problems just looking to hit you in the ankles. You don't take

06:11.375 --> 06:13.834
it.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.834
You just bob and weave, that's it. Good.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.667
Good, good, good. -Good job!

06:19.709 --> 06:21.917
-Oh my God, I love double dutch!

06:21.959 --> 06:24.750
-Well get in there ya saucy elf! -Okay!

06:24.792 --> 06:27.667
: Okay...Ahh.

06:28.667 --> 06:31.625
-Way to go!

06:33.875 --> 06:36.834
: Ow!

06:36.875 --> 06:39.250
-Oh, totally! NBD! Let's get going.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.875
No, it's just a scratch.

06:41.917 --> 06:45.083
Okay, so let's keep these fun ropes swinging.

06:45.125 --> 06:49.875
-Ha! What a champ! Go Nisha! -Thanks! Let's do this.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.792
-Nice!

06:51.834 --> 06:55.667
-You know, this is amazing! It's like reminding me...

06:55.709 --> 06:57.959
: Ohhh, oh yeah.

07:01.750 --> 07:04.750
-Yeah, yeah I'm fine.

07:04.792 --> 07:07.125
Look at me. Spin the ropes.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.291
See? I'm doin' it!

07:09.333 --> 07:12.458
Never give up on your...

07:15.458 --> 07:17.875
-Sweet mother of pete.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.000
-Again. -Miss, maybe you should...

07:20.041 --> 07:23.959
-Shhh! Can it. -Oooh.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.792
: Ms Galka told me to go to the principal's office.

07:28.834 --> 07:31.291
: Again? You know where it is.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.792
Trudy, so just to be clear.

07:43.834 --> 07:48.333
When a student is sent to the "principal's office"

07:43.834 --> 07:48.333
You send half of them to me.

07:48.375 --> 07:51.417
-They're not playing favourite, Robert. They can't stand

07:48.375 --> 07:51.417
either one of you.

07:51.458 --> 07:55.083
They're just used to turning left to go into the principals

07:51.458 --> 07:55.083
office.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.667
-Of course we're all very sorry to hear about the passing of

08:02.000 --> 08:05.667
Hayden's dad.

08:05.709 --> 08:08.208
He was a wonderful and giving man.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.125
And a real looker if I may say so.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.125
-Sit down.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.333
-Oh shut up! -Yeah.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.333
: Seriously?

08:13.375 --> 08:17.667
-Mr. Gilmour's estate lawyer is here and he has some information

08:13.375 --> 08:17.667
he'd like to share with us.

08:17.709 --> 08:19.834
: Thank you.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.583
Since the death of Hayden's mother Mr. Gilmour has been

08:19.875 --> 08:23.583
very grateful to all of you,

08:23.625 --> 08:27.208
Hayden's favourite staff members, for the support

08:23.625 --> 08:27.208
system that you provided.

08:27.250 --> 08:31.500
And he just wanted to give you a little something to

08:27.250 --> 08:31.500
show his appreciation.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.792
-Trudy Walsh. -Hello.

08:33.834 --> 08:37.542
-For your kindness and support, Mr. Gilmour bequeathed you...

08:37.583 --> 08:40.000
Five thousand dollars.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.208
: Has he?

08:42.250 --> 08:44.375
-Didn't even know he knew you. -Five thousand dollars.

08:44.417 --> 08:48.542
-"May you take the adult cruise

08:44.417 --> 08:48.542
you always talked about."

08:50.500 --> 08:53.291
The one with all the single people?

08:50.500 --> 08:53.291
-Just stay away from it.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.500
That's all I ask. -Sorry.

08:55.542 --> 08:57.458
-Bobbi Galka. -Yup.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.667
-For encouraging Hayden to keep fit, while having fun.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.000
-He's a good kid. -Five thousand dollars.

09:02.041 --> 09:04.333
: That's very... That's very generous.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.625
I accept. -For being a bad role model.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.500
-"May you buy that Harley and ride into the sunset

09:09.542 --> 09:14.333
with your Dykes on Bikes club that I understand you so

09:09.542 --> 09:14.333
revere."

09:14.375 --> 09:17.583
: Motor bike. -Oh, I don't, I don't unders...

09:14.375 --> 09:17.583
But I don't care.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.542
-Mr. Hunt. -Mmm hmm.

09:19.583 --> 09:21.834
For turning Hayden onto science...

09:19.583 --> 09:21.834
-Literally my job.

09:21.875 --> 09:24.291
!

09:24.333 --> 09:27.417
-It's goin' up, it's goin' up. -Holy smoke, I might join

09:24.333 --> 09:27.417
that club.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.417
-It's science. -And lastly...

09:29.458 --> 09:32.125
-Number's goin' up. Oh my God, fifty.

09:29.458 --> 09:32.125
: Science.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.000
-Gerry Duncan.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.208
-Just say fifty, just say it.

09:36.250 --> 09:40.417
-Every day, Hayden would come home and rave about the

09:36.250 --> 09:40.417
amazing Mr. Duncan.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.583
He didn't do that for these three.

09:42.625 --> 09:46.041
-A man who is so committed to educating his students that...

09:42.625 --> 09:46.041
: Committed.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.208
-He didn't have time to attend Hayden's events.

09:46.083 --> 09:49.208
-Busy.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.542
: Come in. : Praised, committed.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.834
Those are some expensive words. You hear this?

09:54.875 --> 09:58.250
-And that is why, Mr. Duncan... -Hey, thanks buddy.

09:58.291 --> 10:01.583
-That Mr. Gilmour bequeathed you his most valued possession.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.375
-Legal guardianship of Hayden.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.625
-Awwwww.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.625
-It's pass, it's a hard pass.

10:12.667 --> 10:14.750
Out. I'm out.

10:14.792 --> 10:16.959
-To ensure that Hayden's needs will be met...

10:17.000 --> 10:20.959
You'll be given a monthly allowance of five thousand

10:17.000 --> 10:20.959
dollars.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.166
You...Shut up!

10:26.208 --> 10:28.542
You all thought I was serious.

10:31.583 --> 10:36.083
-The five thousand dollar a month classic Hayden/Duncan

10:31.583 --> 10:36.083
banter?

10:36.125 --> 10:39.125
Welcome to my family. : It's a happy ending.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.417
Just like you might find on... : The Oprah Show.

10:42.458 --> 10:44.583
: Can you send me the payments in cash?

10:44.625 --> 10:48.583
Because my bank puts a hold on all my cheques. It's gotta be

10:44.625 --> 10:48.583
cash.

10:48.625 --> 10:51.500
-Get in here.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.375
-Good morning, co-principal Mason!

11:01.333 --> 11:05.083
