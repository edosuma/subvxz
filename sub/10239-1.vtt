02:28.967 --> 02:30.161
Mike?

02:31.567 --> 02:32.886
Mike?

02:38.367 --> 02:41.279
Mike?
- Just stay put, shitface!

02:41.687 --> 02:44.247
What do you want?

02:44.287 --> 02:47.359
I don't know! I just got
out of the Hospital.

02:47.407 --> 02:48.965
I am looking for Mike too.

02:49.367 --> 02:51.881
I mean, I need some...

02:52.087 --> 02:54.078
...I gotta get some dope.

02:54.367 --> 02:57.677
Don't play cute! We've
been looking

02:57.767 --> 02:59.917
for your friend Mike for
a month.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.764
Son of a bitch took off
with a 100 Grand.

03:01.887 --> 03:04.162
A 100 Grand. Our 100 Grand
from our dope.

03:05.087 --> 03:06.964
I didn't know. I didn't know
anything about it.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.476
Come on shitface,
where is he?

03:09.687 --> 03:11.279
I tell you I don't know,
I don't know!

03:11.687 --> 03:13.279
This is so you know what
Mike's got coming

03:13.367 --> 03:15.278
to from ripping us off,
Pigface!

03:15.367 --> 03:17.358
I have nothing to do
with it.

03:17.407 --> 03:18.886
Let me go, please?

03:18.967 --> 03:20.161
Ok. Just let me go.

03:20.287 --> 03:24.485
Sure. So you can tip him off
uh? Shitface!

03:28.287 --> 03:29.879
No I won't.

03:33.487 --> 03:36.285
I won't
- I swear.

03:59.087 --> 04:01.476
Hey Bernie, I owe you 5 bucks

04:03.367 --> 04:04.686
Who was he?

04:04.887 --> 04:08.562
Tim Berret. A user.
Casual pusher. He was released

04:08.767 --> 04:11.156
from a treatment center
this morning.

04:11.287 --> 04:13.243
Yeah? How long he's been
there?

04:13.287 --> 04:16.084
5 Weeks. They thought he'd
made it over the hunt.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.565
Yeah, he has now.

04:23.487 --> 04:24.966
Girlfriend?

04:25.167 --> 04:28.284
No, she owns the apartment.

04:28.487 --> 04:31.320
The Janitor says her name
is Mirna Stann.

04:31.367 --> 04:34.165
She's a tour guide, out of
town at the moment so it seems

04:34.367 --> 04:36.085
What is he doing here then?

04:36.287 --> 04:38.243
Who knows? Maybe looking
for someone?

04:38.287 --> 04:40.084
You know how this sounds like
to me? - No.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.965
Sounds like a hassle
between small time pushers!

04:43.087 --> 04:45.078
Look. Trace the girl.
She's the only one who can

04:45.287 --> 04:47.278
lead us to anything.
And I want a detailed report

04:47.367 --> 04:49.085
from ballistics as soon as
they're through.

04:49.167 --> 04:50.486
See you Sergeant.
- Alright!

04:50.687 --> 04:52.359
Missed the Giants again.

05:36.687 --> 05:38.359
What a hole, Rudy!

05:38.967 --> 05:41.356
I thought Paraguay was
gonna be a REAL town?

05:41.567 --> 05:44.240
Yeah, with discotheques
and with a Macy's Branch

05:44.287 --> 05:47.757
store and 2 or 3 guys rolling
by on their Kawasaki's, uh?

05:48.367 --> 05:51.286
Some vacation I had to go
and pick for myself.

05:51.287 --> 05:53.482
You two sure suckered me
on this one!

05:53.687 --> 05:55.962
I told you.
Never trust my sister.

05:56.087 --> 05:59.477
Never trust you and your
adventures in the jungle.

05:59.687 --> 06:00.358
Come on, Gloria.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.364
Let's go change that damned
dollars of yours, OK?

06:02.687 --> 06:04.279
I wanna try and find
myself a shower!

06:04.487 --> 06:06.478
We'll be lucky if we
can find some gas.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.761
Hm. Yeah!

06:15.287 --> 06:15.685
Good morning

06:15.887 --> 06:16.285
Good morning

06:16.487 --> 06:17.681
Good morning, sir

06:17.767 --> 06:19.962
Good morning, welcome to Paraguay

06:20.087 --> 06:21.679
Money exchange, please.

06:22.087 --> 06:23.281
What happens around here?

06:23.367 --> 06:25.358
Nothing, madam, nothing ever

06:25.767 --> 06:28.486
You are lucky, until today
there was no money

06:29.167 --> 06:33.763
Ah, excuse me! Is there any way
to get a shower around here?

06:33.967 --> 06:37.880
In my private home, madam,
there is no hotel here!

06:38.287 --> 06:39.242
What did he say?

06:39.287 --> 06:41.084
He wants to take you home!

06:41.287 --> 06:42.356
He has a shower.

06:44.567 --> 06:45.363
Please

06:45.487 --> 06:46.317
Yes?

06:46.367 --> 06:51.282
In Bogota they told me to
follow this road until here

06:51.487 --> 06:53.284
to here and then...

06:53.487 --> 06:55.284
Where do you want to go?

06:55.487 --> 06:57.364
We don't know exactly, Señor.

06:57.487 --> 06:59.876
We're looking for a village
called Mañyoca!

07:01.367 --> 07:04.484
I don't know any village
called Mañyoca, madam.

07:04.687 --> 07:07.485
There are so many, so small
and dangerous.

07:07.567 --> 07:12.277
Animals, hungler, snakes,
you understand madam?

07:12.487 --> 07:15.684
But there must be a village
by that name, I'm sure

07:15.767 --> 07:17.246
There is a river Mañyoca,

07:17.287 --> 07:19.676
but to go in there by car
is too difficult.

07:19.887 --> 07:22.162
You must cross the Rio and
then follow the trail

07:22.367 --> 07:23.959
for 80 miles, and
the road is very bad.

07:24.167 --> 07:27.876
You have to go by foot, madam
It's dangerous, very dangerous

07:27.967 --> 07:30.561
You should go back
to the capital

07:31.367 --> 07:32.686
Your money, madam

07:32.967 --> 07:34.082
Thank you

07:34.287 --> 07:38.280
Well Sergeant.
How about that shower?

07:51.687 --> 07:53.678
That dumb twat's
really getting to me.

07:53.767 --> 07:56.156
I almost wish she'd
get left behind.

07:57.167 --> 07:59.681
We still got half
an hour to go.

07:59.887 --> 08:00.876
She'll get here.

08:01.087 --> 08:02.566
Go, go, come

08:21.367 --> 08:22.356
Bye

08:22.487 --> 08:23.761
Bye, Juanita

08:24.287 --> 08:25.879
How did the shower go?

08:25.967 --> 08:27.286
Oh not bad.

08:27.767 --> 08:30.884
So long banito. And
try washing some time, uh!

08:31.287 --> 08:32.686
Bye, sweetheart.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.355
Everything for the country,
hurray America!

09:01.487 --> 09:07.278
Listen, please, do you know
a village called Mañyoca?

09:07.367 --> 09:09.483
No, madam, I don't

09:11.087 --> 09:13.123
Bet this village of yours
doesn't even exist.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.158
You probably dreamed it up
one night while you

09:15.287 --> 09:16.276
were writing your thesis.

09:16.367 --> 09:19.916
I didn't dream anything up.
Look at this article.

09:19.967 --> 09:23.482
It was written 4 years ago.
August 21st, 1976.

09:25.367 --> 09:28.359
Hmm... We heard several
reports recently that along

09:28.407 --> 09:30.238
on the Frenco River, one of
the Amazon's major

09:30.287 --> 09:33.085
tributaries at least 3
incidents of cannibalism had

09:33.287 --> 09:35.676
been witnessed by outsiders.
In the village of Mañyoca...

09:35.887 --> 09:38.355
oh you can't believe
everything you read.

09:38.887 --> 09:42.277
She didn't believe it either.
That's why we're here.

09:43.087 --> 09:45.681
In 2 months, thank god,
it will all be over.

09:45.767 --> 09:48.361
I'll present my dissertation
and then I'll be through

09:48.567 --> 09:50.444
hearing about cannibals.

09:50.487 --> 09:52.478
Mind if a dummy asks what it
is you hope to find in

09:52.687 --> 09:54.086
this blessed village?

09:54.367 --> 09:58.360
I told you. My thesis claims
that cannibalism as an

09:58.567 --> 10:02.480
organized practice of
human society does not exist.

10:02.687 --> 10:04.882
And historically
has never existed.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.236
So much the better, dear!

10:06.287 --> 10:09.677
According to Gloria,
men eat men is bullshit.

10:09.887 --> 10:11.161
Let's say
it was an invention

10:11.287 --> 10:13.243
of racist colonialism.

10:13.287 --> 10:16.359
Which had a vasted interest
in creating the myth of the

10:16.487 --> 10:20.162
ferocious subhuman savage
fit only for extermination.

10:20.367 --> 10:23.484
The mythical lie of
Cannibal Ferox was only an

10:23.567 --> 10:26.764
alibi to justify the greed
and cruelty of the

10:26.887 --> 10:28.957
conquistadores.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.476
But what's Mañyoca got
to do with it?

10:31.687 --> 10:36.556
Well, if we can prove, that
the incidents of cannibalism

10:36.767 --> 10:40.286
reported by that magazine,
never actually happened...

10:40.287 --> 10:42.278
...I have rock solid
definitive support for

10:42.367 --> 10:44.085
my P.H.D. dissertation.

10:44.567 --> 10:46.762
Well you promised to take
a bunch of pictures of me.

10:46.887 --> 10:48.559
And that's all I care about.

10:48.687 --> 10:50.279
Hey man. You think there
is a chance we'll bump

10:50.367 --> 10:51.800
into a few cocoa leaves?

10:51.847 --> 10:53.280
Gloria, do you believe this?

10:53.687 --> 10:55.279
Hey what's that? What?

10:59.487 --> 11:03.560
It's called the queen of marks
you have to eat it

11:03.687 --> 11:05.757
or it brings bad luck

11:07.767 --> 11:08.279
Why is he...

11:08.367 --> 11:09.959
He's doing it
to avoid bad luck.

11:15.687 --> 11:17.962
What's the matter, Gloria?
Are you alright?

11:27.167 --> 11:28.236
What did she say?

11:28.287 --> 11:31.165
This cozumbo can save you,
Madam.

11:31.367 --> 11:34.279
It's dangerous out there and
if it's around, the snakes

11:34.367 --> 11:38.280
will attack him and not
the americans, clear?

11:38.487 --> 11:39.681
Claro!

11:39.887 --> 11:41.286
Very clear.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.483
The life of the weak,
for that of the strong!

11:43.687 --> 11:45.086
You stake him out and
the snakes will go for him

11:45.287 --> 11:46.242
instead of us.

11:46.287 --> 11:47.356
The law of the jungle.

11:54.367 --> 11:55.482
You want me to drive?

11:55.567 --> 11:58.684
No. I can take it for
another hour or so!

12:12.287 --> 12:14.357
Oh look! An iguana!

12:14.567 --> 12:15.886
Don't hit it...

12:20.367 --> 12:21.959
Where the hell are you going?

12:23.367 --> 12:27.360
Damn. Jay walking Iguana.
That's all we need now.

12:27.407 --> 12:29.284
Alright.
Gloria, you drive and I push, ok?

12:29.687 --> 12:31.166
Yeah
- Shit!

12:33.287 --> 12:35.278
Come on.
Pat, get out and help.

12:38.487 --> 12:41.285
Easy.
Don't race it too much.

12:42.287 --> 12:46.280
That's it. That's it.
Rock it.

12:47.887 --> 12:49.559
Go. Go!

12:49.767 --> 12:51.485
Ok hold it. That's it!

12:54.887 --> 12:56.878
Score one for the good guys.

13:01.567 --> 13:03.159
Oh shit.

13:03.687 --> 13:06.884
Good boy Rudy. We got 1000s
of bottles of Whiskey.

13:16.287 --> 13:19.962
Hey leave some for the troops!
I'll pretend it's

13:20.087 --> 13:21.076
a mint tulip.

13:22.367 --> 13:26.485
Don't move. Don't move.

13:35.687 --> 13:37.882
It's alright now, princess.
You're still the fairest

13:38.087 --> 13:39.964
to the land. Just kidding.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.279
Looks like you're ready
for that drink.

13:44.287 --> 13:46.357
Why couldn't we've made it
Acapulco instead of this

13:46.487 --> 13:47.886
poisoned paradise?

13:47.967 --> 13:49.366
All you would've found
there, would've been

13:49.407 --> 13:50.362
white Widows!

13:54.287 --> 13:55.766
All these trees!
Not even a trail anymore!

13:55.967 --> 13:57.082
Oh, cut it out!

13:57.487 --> 13:59.478
A little positive thinking
never hurt anyone.

13:59.567 --> 14:02.764
So what do you wanna do?
Go on or go back?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.366
There is nothing marked
on this map.

14:04.487 --> 14:05.886
Nothing but swamp.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.958
It's simple,
let's toss a coin!

14:08.687 --> 14:10.166
For me it's no problem.
Either way,

14:10.367 --> 14:11.686
I don't give a shit!

14:13.887 --> 14:18.278
Ok. Head's we go on
and Tail's we give in.

14:18.887 --> 14:20.286
Flip it.
- Ok!

14:22.967 --> 14:24.286
Heads!

14:34.767 --> 14:36.166
Should've come
with a Hovercraft!

14:36.287 --> 14:37.686
I wish I'd gone to Acapulco.

14:38.287 --> 14:39.959
Hey, I think we're sinking!

14:40.167 --> 14:45.082
Shit. The engine's blown.
There goes our transport.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.164
Ok, Let's get everything
we can carry out before

14:49.287 --> 14:50.285
it all goes under.

14:50.286 --> 14:50.685
Yeah. Right.

14:50.767 --> 14:51.756
Don't forget the whiskey.

14:51.887 --> 14:54.285
You worry about the First Aid Kit
and the batteries.

14:54.286 --> 14:55.356
And I'll get the rest.

15:13.687 --> 15:16.565
I hate to see it all go
down the drain because

15:16.767 --> 15:18.280
a jeep gets stuck!

15:18.967 --> 15:22.277
Now we have 2 options:
One we turn back.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.756
Paraguay is a
3 or 4 day hike.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.286
Or we hove it to the river
assuming we can find it.

15:28.287 --> 15:29.242
Does it make a difference?

15:29.287 --> 15:31.755
No. I mean either way
we gotta hike so move ahead.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.366
You never know, we may run
into somebody to

15:33.487 --> 15:34.681
hitch a ride from.

15:34.887 --> 15:37.082
Or better yet, even stumble
on your blessed village and

15:37.287 --> 15:39.278
kill two parrots with
one cracker!

16:16.887 --> 16:18.286
Stay where you are.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.766
How disgusting.

16:58.567 --> 17:01.684
Let's get out of here.
I've got a bad feeling!

18:40.487 --> 18:42.364
Rudy! Rudy wake up!

18:42.767 --> 18:43.563
What's happening?

18:43.687 --> 18:44.676
An Anaconda!

18:58.887 --> 19:00.366
Oh poor little thing!

19:06.287 --> 19:07.242
Forget it Gloria.

19:07.287 --> 19:08.879
There's nothing you can do!

19:27.167 --> 19:29.476
That might have been
one of us.

19:43.367 --> 19:45.483
How much longer
we got to go?

19:45.687 --> 19:47.962
I've had it.
Oh my poor feet!

19:48.167 --> 19:50.397
Oh, come on.
Think positive!

19:50.447 --> 19:52.677
The river can't
be too far now.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.282
Come on. This way!

20:02.087 --> 20:03.281
Oh my god.

20:31.487 --> 20:34.160
I wanna get out of here.
Get out of here! I want out.

20:35.487 --> 20:36.363
Stop it.

20:36.487 --> 20:38.079
You'll only make it worse.

20:38.367 --> 20:38.879
Stop it!

20:38.967 --> 20:40.285
I'm going crazy,
I can't, I can't!

20:40.286 --> 20:40.878
That's enough.

20:41.087 --> 20:41.963
Cut it out!

20:57.287 --> 20:59.357
Help us. Help us.

21:00.887 --> 21:02.878
Quickly gimme a hand with
him and let's move.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.759
Who are you guys?
What happened?

21:05.287 --> 21:07.084
Cannibals. They attacked us.

21:07.167 --> 21:07.758
We gotta get out of here.

21:07.887 --> 21:08.763
Come on!

21:08.887 --> 21:10.161
Pat. Get my gear.

21:12.287 --> 21:14.881
The Mañyoca River is
less than 2 miles away.

21:15.087 --> 21:16.759
If we can make it, we'll be okay

21:27.687 --> 21:28.676
Feeling better now?

21:28.767 --> 21:29.677
Yeah thanks.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.078
Only a swallow, ok? Ok!

21:33.287 --> 21:34.561
Last bottle we got left!

21:42.967 --> 21:44.480
Yeah, we're from
New York too.

21:44.687 --> 21:46.279
My name is Mike.
Mike Logan.

21:46.487 --> 21:48.286
The asshole there is Joe.

21:48.287 --> 21:49.242
A born loser!

21:49.287 --> 21:50.686
Unlucky, he? Uh-hum.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.280
Just a fuck-up!

21:52.487 --> 21:53.761
Want some.

21:53.887 --> 21:55.286
No. I don't drink.

21:55.487 --> 21:57.284
This here is my speed!

22:00.967 --> 22:01.683
Cocaine?

22:01.767 --> 22:02.756
Want some?

22:05.287 --> 22:07.084
Snow is bottom line.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.236
It doesn't break you down.

22:08.287 --> 22:11.677
No needles, no horseshit
and you feel real.

22:11.767 --> 22:13.285
You haven't told us yet,
what you were doing

22:13.286 --> 22:14.322
in that clearing.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.356
What happened to you?

22:15.487 --> 22:18.763
Right, it isn't like we met
in Rockefeller Center, is it?

22:18.967 --> 22:21.481
Had a bad trip,
didn't we Joe?

22:23.567 --> 22:26.684
We came down here about a
month ago. From Tenuyo.

22:26.887 --> 22:28.764
We hopped on down the
Paraguay to stock up

22:28.967 --> 22:29.877
on snow.

22:30.087 --> 22:32.286
And that's where we
met this guy!

22:32.287 --> 22:32.878
Who?

22:33.087 --> 22:34.076
Oh, A Portuguese.

22:34.287 --> 22:35.276
Emerald prospector.

22:35.487 --> 22:36.886
Soares was his name.

22:36.967 --> 22:37.683
A good looking guy.

22:37.887 --> 22:38.364
About 30.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.159
Been down here for years.

22:40.287 --> 22:41.276
So I got this idea.

22:41.367 --> 22:43.676
Why not join up with him,
I said to Joe.

22:43.767 --> 22:45.883
We'll all go into
business together.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.286
Emeralds and Cocaine.

22:47.367 --> 22:48.287
Can't miss me.

22:48.288 --> 22:49.686
But...

22:49.887 --> 22:51.081
How'd you get out here?

22:51.167 --> 22:52.680
We travelled upstream to
Mañyoca.

22:52.887 --> 22:55.799
Started panning the riverbed,
all three of us.

22:55.847 --> 22:58.759
That Portuguese was real
sharp. Then a week ago...

22:58.887 --> 23:00.161
What happened?

23:00.367 --> 23:02.676
A week ago, just as when
we were zeroing in what

23:02.887 --> 23:04.479
looked like a rich vein,

23:04.567 --> 23:07.365
we began to notice that
they were there, hanging

23:07.407 --> 23:08.157
around in the bushes...

23:08.287 --> 23:09.561
Listen, Mike!

23:09.607 --> 23:10.835
Shut up asshole.

23:10.887 --> 23:13.879
I wanted to turn back but
Soares said they were

23:13.967 --> 23:15.241
harmless.

23:15.287 --> 23:18.286
Anyway one night they
suddenly jumped us three.

23:18.287 --> 23:20.278
Took us prisoner and
dragged us off to

23:20.367 --> 23:22.244
that damned village.

23:22.287 --> 23:26.166
It's 10 miles away from
here. Maybe less, who knows.

23:26.367 --> 23:29.086
It was a bad bad scene.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.359
But, how can you be so
sure they were cannibals?

23:32.567 --> 23:33.556
Maybe they were only primitives

23:33.767 --> 23:34.882
Oh yeah, twat?

23:35.167 --> 23:37.681
Then listen to what your
primitives did to us!

23:37.887 --> 23:40.276
When we got to that damn
village, they shut us up in

23:40.367 --> 23:43.359
a bamboo cage. Stuck in
a stinking mud hole.

23:43.567 --> 23:46.764
Infested with 3 inch
long bloodsuckers.

23:46.887 --> 23:48.764
We had dozens all over
us in minutes.

23:48.887 --> 23:51.606
You wanna know how much
blood we lost?

23:51.647 --> 23:54.366
The Portugese got the
worst of it.

23:54.487 --> 23:57.081
God knows why, but they
seemed to hate him with

23:57.167 --> 23:58.361
a passion.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.478
They tied him to a stake
in the middle of

24:00.567 --> 24:01.686
the village.

24:01.687 --> 24:02.756
And then...

24:02.967 --> 24:04.685
Go on Mike!

24:05.087 --> 24:06.236
...and then

24:06.287 --> 24:09.085
they castrated him with a
machete, and then they ate

24:09.287 --> 24:10.163
his genitals...

24:10.367 --> 24:11.561
No Mike damn it. Stop it.

24:11.687 --> 24:12.676
That's enough.

24:12.887 --> 24:13.478
It doesn't matter.

24:13.687 --> 24:14.676
It's been done.

24:14.887 --> 24:21.679
Ok. Ok, Joe. The main thing
is that we got out of it.

24:23.167 --> 24:25.681
We managed to escape with
the help of those two poor

24:25.887 --> 24:27.878
bastards back there.

24:28.087 --> 24:30.681
You saw them, didn't you?

24:37.567 --> 24:40.161
They tied him to a stake
and they castrated him

24:40.367 --> 24:44.485
with a machete and then
they ate his genitals.

24:44.687 --> 24:47.884
Cannibalism as an organized
practice of human society

24:47.967 --> 24:49.559
does not exist.

25:00.687 --> 25:02.484
Don't you ever get bored
playing with your

25:02.687 --> 25:03.881
six-shooter?

25:25.087 --> 25:26.281
Gloria?

25:33.087 --> 25:34.281
Gloria!

25:44.287 --> 25:45.083
Gloria!

25:45.287 --> 25:46.163
Hey what's up?

25:46.367 --> 25:49.165
Gloria has disappeared,
we gotta do something.

25:49.367 --> 25:49.879
She can't be far.

25:50.087 --> 25:50.883
Calm down.

25:51.167 --> 25:52.286
Joe, wake up!

25:52.287 --> 25:53.356
I'm awake!

25:54.167 --> 25:55.680
We gotta try to find Gloria.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.479
Now you go with Rudy and
try to keep out of the

25:57.567 --> 25:59.159
heavy brush as much
as possible.

25:59.287 --> 26:00.686
I'll search along the
riverbed with Pat.

26:00.887 --> 26:01.285
Wait a minute.

26:01.487 --> 26:02.556
I got no weapons, Mike!

26:02.687 --> 26:04.166
Rudy has got his machete.

26:04.367 --> 26:05.402
Now get going.

26:05.447 --> 26:06.482
Pat. Come on!

26:18.767 --> 26:20.086
Gloria!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.561
Gloria?

26:53.567 --> 26:54.079
Oh Christ.

26:54.167 --> 26:54.883
A village.

26:55.167 --> 26:56.282
Listen, let's turn back.

26:56.367 --> 26:58.562
If they catch us,
they'll tear us to pieces.

26:58.687 --> 27:00.359
Looks like there's
no one there?

27:01.087 --> 27:03.282
Maybe they're all gone?

27:03.687 --> 27:05.279
Wait for me here!

27:05.687 --> 27:06.437
Don't be crazy, Rudy!

27:06.487 --> 27:07.681
They'll kill you,
they'll kill you!

27:42.087 --> 27:43.287
Let's get out of here.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.481
Look. Please!

27:44.967 --> 27:46.286
That's the Portugese?

27:46.487 --> 27:47.363
Yeah. But let's go.

27:47.487 --> 27:49.079
Let's get out of here!

28:33.887 --> 28:35.559
Gloria! Where are you?

28:36.567 --> 28:37.886
Shh. Listen.

28:40.767 --> 28:42.678
Help. Help.

28:42.887 --> 28:43.763
Gloria, are you alright?

28:43.967 --> 28:46.286
Oh God. Help me Mike.

28:46.287 --> 28:48.084
Help me please!

28:50.087 --> 28:51.361
Don't move.

28:52.567 --> 28:53.761
Don't move.

29:12.287 --> 29:14.482
Alright, alright. It's all over.

29:16.687 --> 29:17.687
Come on.
Don't just stand there.

29:17.688 --> 29:19.086
Give me a little help.

29:22.487 --> 29:25.877
Oh my God. Did you have
to torture it that way?

29:25.967 --> 29:28.276
What you get off on
ecology, huh twat?

29:28.487 --> 29:29.363
You're out of your mind.

29:29.567 --> 29:30.966
You scared the pants
off of all of us.

29:31.087 --> 29:32.566
How did you fall into
that damn hole?

29:32.767 --> 29:33.961
I've got no idea.

29:34.167 --> 29:36.556
I wanted to go and have a
wash in the river and the

29:36.767 --> 29:39.486
ground just gave
way under me...

29:39.767 --> 29:41.246
And you were damn lucky.

29:41.287 --> 29:42.959
The Indios usually plant a
poisoned shag pile of

29:43.087 --> 29:44.964
bamboo stakes in
their traps.

29:45.487 --> 29:46.966
Where are the others?

29:55.367 --> 29:57.676
Haven't you had enough yet?

29:57.887 --> 30:00.082
There's something,
I can't figure out!

30:00.167 --> 30:01.282
What's that?

30:01.367 --> 30:05.155
I don't know, but how come
all the younger indios have

30:05.287 --> 30:08.962
left the village and when
we go near those old ones

30:09.167 --> 30:10.236
over there.

30:10.287 --> 30:12.084
Why do they act so scared?

30:12.287 --> 30:13.686
I told you the whole story.

30:13.887 --> 30:16.685
How could they not be
uptight after what happened?

30:16.767 --> 30:20.282
Yeah. Yeah maybe
it's like you say.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.284
But they seem scared of us.

30:22.487 --> 30:23.920
Of our white skin.

30:23.967 --> 30:26.162
As if we were gonna do
something to them.

30:26.287 --> 30:27.276
Should be the other
way around.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.880
Oh come on.
Cut it with this drivel.

30:29.167 --> 30:29.883
Listen.

30:29.967 --> 30:32.162
I'd say Gloria's question
has been well answered.

30:32.287 --> 30:32.958
Is this sufficient?

30:33.087 --> 30:34.486
Is this what you
wanted to know?

30:34.567 --> 30:36.683
Yes. Let's turn back.

30:36.767 --> 30:38.280
The sooner the better.

30:38.767 --> 30:40.280
Joe. Joe.

30:40.967 --> 30:43.481
Oh Christ. He's fainted.

30:43.687 --> 30:44.676
Here, make him drink.

30:44.887 --> 30:46.366
He is really sick.

30:46.567 --> 30:49.081
I've got some cormen
in the first aid kit!

30:49.287 --> 30:50.879
Pulse rate is very weak.

30:51.087 --> 30:52.156
Mike!

30:53.367 --> 30:55.483
Help me get him in the shade.

31:00.887 --> 31:04.084
Burning. Burning up.

31:04.767 --> 31:06.485
Do something.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.285
Now take it easy.

31:08.487 --> 31:09.966
Be patient.

31:10.687 --> 31:13.076
You'll feel better
tomorrow, you'll see.

31:14.287 --> 31:16.676
Here. Let me give
him a sip of water.

31:18.367 --> 31:20.562
Pus is forming
in the wounds.

31:20.767 --> 31:22.803
I am afraid
of blood poisoning.

31:22.847 --> 31:24.883
What are we going to do now?

31:24.967 --> 31:27.356
Give him all the
antibiotics you've got left

31:27.407 --> 31:28.760
and let's leave him here.

31:28.967 --> 31:31.686
Better only one
of us buys it right.

31:32.367 --> 31:35.086
We can build a stretcher
and take him with us.

31:35.167 --> 31:36.077
Bullshit.

31:36.287 --> 31:39.882
We wouldn't get 3 miles and
it would be useless anyway.

31:39.967 --> 31:42.686
Then we'll wait here
until he can walk again.

31:42.967 --> 31:44.241
Listen, twat.

31:44.287 --> 31:46.164
I can probably make
it on my own.

31:46.367 --> 31:50.485
But I like you kids so I'll
stay with you and we'll

31:50.687 --> 31:52.678
sink or swim together.

31:52.887 --> 31:56.163
Now I've got 4 slugs in
this thing still no use

31:56.287 --> 31:59.962
against the cannibals
but enough for us.

32:00.287 --> 32:02.084
If they come back.

32:02.367 --> 32:06.758
Bang! That's it. Agreed?

32:11.287 --> 32:12.481
Agreed!

32:48.887 --> 32:50.161
Give me just a little more.

32:50.287 --> 32:51.481
It's fantastic.

33:07.367 --> 33:09.358
What do you do
in the big apple?

33:10.367 --> 33:13.359
I was working in a motel to
pay my way through college

33:13.487 --> 33:16.479
a shitty 160 a week to
clerk nights in the Bronx.

33:16.687 --> 33:18.279
On your toes from dusk
till dawn.

33:18.367 --> 33:19.880
6 Nights a week.

33:19.967 --> 33:21.878
What a shuffle for me.

33:23.287 --> 33:24.686
No extras?

33:24.887 --> 33:26.240
Oh. A little now and then.

33:26.287 --> 33:28.278
When we get some fellow
with a briefcase

33:28.367 --> 33:29.243
full of bread.

33:29.287 --> 33:31.084
That didn't take much
effort, did it?

33:31.287 --> 33:32.515
Oh, macho attitude.

33:32.567 --> 33:34.523
Red neck dudes
are really a pain.

33:34.567 --> 33:36.364
Instead of screwing,
Wilbur sits around all

33:36.487 --> 33:39.365
night and complains to you
about his dingy old lady

33:39.407 --> 33:40.362
and his tax returns.

33:40.567 --> 33:41.682
Real assholes!

33:42.367 --> 33:44.085
Wanna know something?

33:44.167 --> 33:46.886
Had you nailed down
the minute I saw you!

33:46.967 --> 33:49.879
Oh you did? What,
that I'm being a whore?

33:50.087 --> 33:51.281
All the way!

33:51.687 --> 33:55.157
A hot pussy little whore,
who arrived down here

33:55.367 --> 33:56.561
looking for freedom.

33:56.767 --> 33:59.759
A victim of puritanical
breeding, seeking release

33:59.967 --> 34:02.481
for a strange new feeling.

34:03.967 --> 34:08.882
Hey. How would you like
to make an Indio Girl?

34:18.967 --> 34:20.366
There they are!

34:22.766 --> 34:24.485
They've been playing with
that tortoise since

34:24.567 --> 34:25.886
early morning.

34:30.286 --> 34:32.164
Let's give them a surprise.
- Ok!

34:40.367 --> 34:41.163
Watch him.

34:41.286 --> 34:42.275
Hold it.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.356
She's a virgin.

34:45.487 --> 34:46.681
If I ever saw one.

34:46.887 --> 34:48.478
Just like me. I imagine.

34:50.286 --> 34:52.243
Now hold still
you little bitch.

34:52.286 --> 34:55.085
Now you try anything and
I'll cut your throat out.

34:55.286 --> 34:57.278
We only wanna have
some fun, you see.

34:57.367 --> 34:58.959
We'll be doing it.
Just hold still.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.162
What are you waiting
for, Pat? Come on.

35:06.767 --> 35:10.362
Enjoy! Make her scream.

35:10.887 --> 35:12.366
Don't be shy.

35:12.567 --> 35:14.285
She's all yours.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.364
Go ahead, Pat.

35:16.567 --> 35:19.081
She's only a filthy
little cannibal.

35:19.367 --> 35:22.882
Cut her. Don't be afraid.

35:23.167 --> 35:24.680
Come on.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.076
Let's see some blood.

35:29.567 --> 35:33.276
Diana... Diana... Diana...
Diana... Diana...

35:34.287 --> 35:36.084
Shut up.

35:36.287 --> 35:38.562
Or I'll blow your mouth out
the other side of your head.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.239
Mike!

35:54.287 --> 35:57.165
You didn't have to do that!

36:02.087 --> 36:04.362
Why'd you kill her,
you bastard?

36:04.487 --> 36:06.762
Get off my case
motherfucker!

36:10.087 --> 36:11.361
Get out of here.

36:13.287 --> 36:14.561
Get up, run!

36:15.567 --> 36:16.682
Come on!

36:23.367 --> 36:27.155
Don't try it again or you'll
end up like her, understand?

36:27.287 --> 36:29.562
Rudy! Rudy!

36:33.287 --> 36:36.085
Rudy!

36:39.767 --> 36:40.756
What's the matter?

36:40.967 --> 36:42.685
It's Joe.
He's had a relapse.

36:44.887 --> 36:46.286
His fever is very high and
he's having difficulty

36:46.487 --> 36:47.556
breathing.

36:49.087 --> 36:50.884
The infection is spreading.

36:51.687 --> 36:52.961
Did you give him any pills?

36:53.007 --> 36:54.281
The cormen is all finished.

36:54.487 --> 36:56.284
All we have left
is a little quionite.

36:56.367 --> 36:57.766
What you need is
more antibiotics.

36:57.887 --> 36:59.878
But it's probably
too late now.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.685
Anyway, you know what
the indios call

37:01.887 --> 37:03.081
Blood Poisoning?

37:03.287 --> 37:05.164
The sickness within
the sickness.

37:05.367 --> 37:08.086
If one of them happens to
get it, they separate him

37:08.167 --> 37:10.556
from the others
and let him die.

37:10.767 --> 37:13.076
And crows arrive to
keep the guy company.

37:13.287 --> 37:14.083
Hundreds of 'em.

37:14.287 --> 37:16.278
Shrieking and cawing and
biding time until they...

37:16.367 --> 37:17.880
Come on. Drop it, will you?

37:17.967 --> 37:19.366
Ok!

37:20.287 --> 37:21.481
There is the root
of a plant.

37:21.687 --> 37:22.278
The Sokaney.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.766
It can bring fever down.

37:23.967 --> 37:25.685
I'll go look
around for some.

37:25.767 --> 37:27.280
Be back before dark.

37:28.687 --> 37:30.484
What happened down
at the river?

37:30.687 --> 37:32.086
I heard a shot!

37:32.287 --> 37:34.286
He killed a young indio girl.

37:34.287 --> 37:35.959
I don't know why!

37:36.487 --> 37:38.682
But one thing is for sure.

37:38.887 --> 37:41.481
I wouldn't put anything
past that bastard.

38:23.687 --> 38:27.282
Get me out of here, get
me out of this swamp Joe.

38:28.287 --> 38:29.686
It's full of piranhas.

38:30.967 --> 38:32.958
Calm down, calm down.

38:39.287 --> 38:40.686
Why don't you
get some sleep?

38:40.887 --> 38:42.684
No. I couldn't sleep.

38:43.687 --> 38:46.485
We've been two dummies,
haven't we, Rudy?

38:46.687 --> 38:48.882
What a waste of vacation.

38:49.287 --> 38:51.562
And maybe our lives too?

38:51.687 --> 38:52.517
Yeah.

38:52.567 --> 38:54.285
No... I don't wanna die.

38:54.367 --> 38:56.278
Don't leave me here to die!
Don't leave me here...

38:56.487 --> 38:58.125
Come on Joe, don't worry.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.362
Joe, we're going to take
you with us. I promise.

39:00.407 --> 39:01.556
Now just be good, ha?

39:01.687 --> 39:03.166
Listen, Gloria.

39:03.287 --> 39:04.356
There is something
I gotta tell you!

39:04.487 --> 39:05.556
You can tell us tomorrow.

39:05.687 --> 39:06.358
Calm down

39:06.567 --> 39:09.877
No. I have to tell
you about it. Listen.

39:10.087 --> 39:11.964
None of that story is true
what Mike said

39:12.087 --> 39:13.156
about the cannibals.

39:13.287 --> 39:14.276
What do you mean.

39:14.367 --> 39:17.086
That what he told you
is a lot of bad shit.

39:18.287 --> 39:20.881
But we all saw the
Portugese tied to the stake!

39:20.967 --> 39:22.958
You saw an
unrecognizable corpse.

39:23.167 --> 39:24.077
Now listen to me.

39:24.287 --> 39:25.083
You're gonna
hear everything.

39:26.367 --> 39:28.961
There never was any
Portugese named Soares.

39:29.167 --> 39:32.079
He was just an Indio
that we met in Paraguay.

39:32.567 --> 39:34.364
He was a real smart dude.

39:34.567 --> 39:37.161
Mike nicknamed him an
Portugese coz he could

39:37.367 --> 39:39.323
speak a few words
of the language.

39:39.367 --> 39:41.285
Mike and I had to split
from New York in a hurry

39:41.286 --> 39:43.085
cause we pulled a sting at
a couple of

39:43.086 --> 39:44.281
Brooklyn Horsemen.

39:45.887 --> 39:48.685
We came down here planning
to prospect for emeralds.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.276
Mike had got this fixation.

39:51.487 --> 39:54.081
He kept pumping the Indio
about where we could

39:54.167 --> 39:55.282
find some.

39:56.887 --> 40:00.084
And finally he gave us the
information we wanted.

40:00.167 --> 40:02.886
At a place called Mañyoca
there was a river

40:03.087 --> 40:04.281
full of stones.

40:04.487 --> 40:06.955
He'd found a lot
of them there himself.

40:07.167 --> 40:09.078
When Mike asked for proof,
he pulled out

40:09.287 --> 40:11.084
three uncut emeralds.

40:17.567 --> 40:20.081
Anyway we took off the next
morning with the Indio

40:20.167 --> 40:21.236
as our guide.

40:21.287 --> 40:23.755
The idea was to rip him off,
swipe all the Emeralds

40:23.887 --> 40:25.479
he'd already found.

40:25.687 --> 40:27.678
We figured he must've had a
big pile of them

40:27.767 --> 40:28.882
hidden some place.

40:28.967 --> 40:31.083
Most likely in
his home village.

40:36.767 --> 40:38.644
Mike had me really going.

40:38.687 --> 40:41.286
All I could think about was,
that I was gonna be rich.

40:41.287 --> 40:43.357
We would hit when
the time was right.

40:43.407 --> 40:44.760
Fast and final.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.762
We panned a gravel at the
Mañyoca River Bed for over

40:49.887 --> 40:53.084
a week with the help of
some local indios.

40:53.367 --> 40:55.164
Man, we must've sifted
through a hundred tons

40:55.287 --> 40:56.561
of that silt.

40:57.287 --> 40:59.357
But we didn't find
a single gem.

41:01.687 --> 41:04.963
One morning, while the
Indios were all hard at it,

41:25.287 --> 41:28.677
the Portugese and his buddy
sure weren't expecting it.

41:28.887 --> 41:32.163
They thought white men were
all fair and honest.

42:02.287 --> 42:04.482
We made them take us
to the village.

42:04.687 --> 42:06.678
It was all going easier
than we thought.

42:06.887 --> 42:09.082
All the young bucks were
off somewhere fishing and

42:09.287 --> 42:11.881
most of the women ran
away into the jungle.

42:12.087 --> 42:14.362
Just those with babies
and a bunch of old fogies

42:14.487 --> 42:16.478
were all that was left.

42:21.367 --> 42:23.562
First thing Mike did,
was take the guy's three

42:23.687 --> 42:25.279
emeralds off him.

42:25.487 --> 42:28.081
Then he began torturing him
to make him tell where

42:28.287 --> 42:30.084
he'd stashed the rest.

42:33.367 --> 42:35.483
The Portugese kept
screaming that he only had

42:35.567 --> 42:36.886
those three stones.

42:37.087 --> 42:39.282
That Mike kill him if
he didn't believe him.

42:39.367 --> 42:41.756
But Mike had a better idea.

43:08.687 --> 43:11.281
With all that cocaine
he was on, Mike went

43:11.367 --> 43:12.880
completely crazy.

43:13.087 --> 43:14.884
He seemed to get a
perverted kick out of

43:15.087 --> 43:17.476
making that poor
son of a bitch suffer.

43:27.687 --> 43:29.678
I couldn't take anymore
of that butchery.

43:29.887 --> 43:31.878
I tried to make him stop
but Mike just got more and

43:31.967 --> 43:34.083
more hysterical and
pushed me away.

43:34.287 --> 43:35.481
Then...

43:56.487 --> 43:58.955
he moaned and groaned
all night long but

43:59.167 --> 44:00.964
he didn't die until
the next morning.

44:01.167 --> 44:02.964
God, how he suffered.

44:06.287 --> 44:09.085
We couldn't stay
in the village any longer.

44:09.167 --> 44:10.759
We had to get out of there
before the younger men came

44:10.887 --> 44:12.764
back from their fishing.

44:12.967 --> 44:15.276
Mike decided to
take along a hostage.

44:15.367 --> 44:16.887
Someone who could also
guide us back

44:16.888 --> 44:18.286
from the jungle.

44:33.887 --> 44:37.084
Well, after we made
maybe a mile that

44:37.287 --> 44:40.882
son of a bitch trap there
came down and got the girl.

44:41.087 --> 44:43.760
Then this warrior charged
out like a maniac but

44:43.887 --> 44:46.276
Mike is a tough customer.

44:46.367 --> 44:48.676
Yeah. It was Mike who
killed the guy.

44:48.767 --> 44:51.156
But before Mike got him,
he shoved his pig sticker

44:51.287 --> 44:54.484
into me and you showed up
right after that.

44:54.887 --> 44:57.276
But then, the cannibals...

44:57.887 --> 45:00.685
This is absurd. It's crazy!

45:03.287 --> 45:05.084
I thought
it was a little fishy.

45:05.287 --> 45:06.356
I knew it!

45:06.567 --> 45:10.286
Just looking at
those old men out there.

45:10.287 --> 45:13.962
The fear and the hate
in their eyes.

45:14.167 --> 45:15.964
He must be totally insane.

45:16.167 --> 45:17.566
With what he's done,
he has driven them right

45:17.687 --> 45:19.757
back to the
level of animals.

45:19.887 --> 45:21.240
Oh god,
they are so exagerated.

45:21.287 --> 45:22.879
God only knows what
they'll do to us

45:22.967 --> 45:24.161
if they catch us.

45:24.287 --> 45:25.481
And worse.

45:25.687 --> 45:27.564
They're sure not
gonna split any hairs.

45:27.767 --> 45:29.359
We'll all pay for this.

45:29.567 --> 45:30.841
Guilty or not!

45:30.887 --> 45:31.876
We have to
get away from him.

45:31.967 --> 45:32.683
Now!

45:32.887 --> 45:34.479
And get Pat away from him.

45:34.687 --> 45:37.281
God damn it. Where is Pat?

45:56.687 --> 45:57.563
They've gone!

45:57.687 --> 45:59.086
And they've took
everything with them.

45:59.287 --> 46:02.165
My camera, the First Aid Kit,
the compass, everything.

46:02.287 --> 46:05.085
And the 5000 Dollars
I kept with the map.

46:05.287 --> 46:08.563
Pat! How could
she do this to us?

46:08.687 --> 46:10.166
Leaving us here alone.

46:10.367 --> 46:12.358
With Joe in there dying.

46:12.567 --> 46:14.478
Mike sucked her in.

46:14.687 --> 46:15.881
Pat is a doormat.

46:16.087 --> 46:17.236
Totally insecure.

46:17.287 --> 46:18.766
Oh god, I thought
I knew her.

46:18.887 --> 46:19.558
It's all our fault.

46:19.767 --> 46:21.678
We should never have
brought her along.

46:21.767 --> 46:24.156
Oh.
She seemed to easy going.

46:24.367 --> 46:26.483
Like she could
handle herself.

46:26.687 --> 46:29.963
Anyway. Spilled milk
is spilled milk.

46:30.007 --> 46:32.362
Oh Rudy. Rudy I can't.

46:32.487 --> 46:34.364
Come on now, sis.

46:34.407 --> 46:36.284
Don't make it worse.

46:37.367 --> 46:40.484
After all Stanley found
what's his name, didn't he?

46:40.567 --> 46:42.683
It's a round world.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.286
You can't just fall off.

46:44.287 --> 46:45.481
Come on.

47:03.767 --> 47:07.476
Let's start with the visit
to a legendary Opium Den.

47:07.567 --> 47:09.364
The House of Ming.

47:09.567 --> 47:10.761
This way please.

47:10.887 --> 47:12.161
Let's move it along.

47:12.367 --> 47:13.356
This way.

47:16.567 --> 47:18.159
Move along.

47:18.287 --> 47:19.276
We're running late.

47:19.487 --> 47:20.966
Come on.

47:26.367 --> 47:27.766
That's her. There.

47:29.087 --> 47:29.678
Now then.

47:29.887 --> 47:32.276
The house of Ming
dates from 1867...

47:32.367 --> 47:33.277
Excuse me, Miss.

47:33.367 --> 47:34.163
Are you Mirna Stann?

47:34.287 --> 47:35.561
Yes. Why?

47:35.687 --> 47:37.882
Lieutenant Liseu.
17th Precinct.

47:38.087 --> 47:39.884
I'd like you
to come with me.

47:39.967 --> 47:42.276
But I can't do that now!
I am working.

47:42.367 --> 47:43.482
So am I!

47:52.087 --> 47:54.078
How long have you been
living in that apartment

47:54.287 --> 47:55.561
on McDougal Street?

47:55.687 --> 47:56.881
About 1 year.

47:57.167 --> 47:58.361
You live alone?

47:58.687 --> 48:00.359
Most of the time.

48:00.687 --> 48:03.286
Lately I've had a
temporary border.

48:03.287 --> 48:05.084
A guy I've met in a bar.

48:05.767 --> 48:07.485
Mike Logan?

48:07.687 --> 48:08.676
How did you know?

48:08.887 --> 48:10.081
It's not important.

48:10.287 --> 48:11.959
Look what do you know
about Mike Logan?

48:12.167 --> 48:13.282
Nothing much.

48:13.367 --> 48:15.961
I'm not the nosy type
like you.

48:16.087 --> 48:18.760
Yes. But if you live
with the man you gotta know

48:18.887 --> 48:20.684
something about him, right?

48:20.767 --> 48:25.286
Yeah. He's tall,
slim and nice, maybe a

48:25.287 --> 48:27.676
little wild for my taste.

48:27.967 --> 48:31.755
But what are you so
interested in Mike for?

48:31.967 --> 48:34.765
Because the boy that was
murdered in your apartment

48:34.967 --> 48:38.277
used to buy smack from
your dear friend Mike.

48:38.367 --> 48:41.564
Come on. Where's he hiding.

48:41.767 --> 48:44.156
I haven't the faintest idea.

48:44.287 --> 48:46.960
I didn't even know about
what happened in my place.

48:47.167 --> 48:50.364
I told you, I've been in
Vegas for the past 5 weeks.

48:50.567 --> 48:52.285
When you picked me up
this morning we've

48:52.367 --> 48:53.959
just gotten in.

48:55.767 --> 48:57.758
Ok. Get back to work!

49:00.887 --> 49:04.277
Madam, be careful. Ok?

49:04.367 --> 49:07.882
And if you hear of anything
gimme a call.

49:10.367 --> 49:11.482
Ross.

49:11.687 --> 49:12.676
Yeah.

49:13.287 --> 49:15.278
I want you to put a tail
on that girl.

49:15.367 --> 49:16.880
Around the clock, get me?

49:17.087 --> 49:18.759
Yeah but that's
gonna cost a lot.

49:18.887 --> 49:20.286
I don't care what it costs.

49:20.487 --> 49:21.687
We get federal aid,
don't we?

49:21.688 --> 49:23.678
Just do it.
- Alright.

49:51.367 --> 49:53.085
Poor Joe.

49:54.287 --> 49:55.766
What a waste.

49:56.087 --> 50:00.160
You know in a way
Mike killed him too.

50:00.687 --> 50:02.882
Who knows how
they met each other.

50:03.087 --> 50:04.964
We know nothing about him.

50:05.167 --> 50:06.885
Not even his last name.

50:07.167 --> 50:09.476
They probably took
his passport as well.

50:09.687 --> 50:10.563
Listen.

50:10.687 --> 50:12.325
Now we gotta
think about us.

50:12.367 --> 50:14.278
Let's bury him
and get out of here.

50:14.487 --> 50:17.285
I figured if we follow the
Mañyoca River upstream,

50:17.367 --> 50:18.561
there must be
other villages.

50:18.767 --> 50:20.359
Let's go.
- Ok!

50:32.567 --> 50:34.478
A rotten Papaya.

50:34.687 --> 50:36.279
Do you know
what that means?

50:36.367 --> 50:39.677
Yeah.
- A curse on us.

50:39.767 --> 50:43.680
But Rudy. I'm scared.
It's too quiet here.

50:43.887 --> 50:46.276
I know something
is gonna happen.

50:54.367 --> 50:56.278
There is someone here.

52:12.687 --> 52:14.166
Don't watch!

52:20.167 --> 52:22.283
No! No!

52:43.487 --> 52:47.366
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Get me out of here!

53:16.767 --> 53:20.077
I think the river
is somewhere over there.

53:20.167 --> 53:21.486
Maybe we're safe there.

53:31.887 --> 53:33.479
Run! Go!

53:51.087 --> 53:53.282
Throw down the knife Rudy.
It's better!

54:09.167 --> 54:11.362
Rudy! Damn it.
Do something.

54:11.487 --> 54:14.160
Pat! Pat!

54:14.367 --> 54:17.677
Please Rudy!

54:57.287 --> 54:59.084
Help me!

55:22.887 --> 55:24.957
Let us out of here.

56:03.487 --> 56:07.765
Cannibalism doesn't exist.
It has never existed!

56:58.367 --> 57:00.278
Why did you
wanna meet out here?

57:00.367 --> 57:01.880
Did Mike send you?

57:02.287 --> 57:03.766
Where is Mike?

57:04.487 --> 57:05.681
No way honey.

57:05.767 --> 57:07.359
You know very well
where that son of a bitch

57:07.407 --> 57:09.079
is and you're gonna tell us!

57:10.287 --> 57:13.279
Come on Bitch.
Where is your stud?

57:17.567 --> 57:19.364
I don't know where Mike is!

57:19.487 --> 57:20.681
Wrong Answer!

57:21.967 --> 57:23.685
Lay off me you bastard.

57:26.287 --> 57:28.278
I don't know anything.
I swear it.

57:28.367 --> 57:31.484
Come on! The Police!
Let's get out of here.

57:33.687 --> 57:35.962
No. Please! No.

57:41.487 --> 57:42.966
We'll get her later.

58:02.087 --> 58:03.964
Are you alright, Miss Stann?
Yeah.

58:04.887 --> 58:07.685
But how do you know my name?

58:07.887 --> 58:09.878
I've been tailing you
for 3 days.

58:10.087 --> 58:11.281
Aren't you honoured?

58:14.287 --> 58:16.482
You could have ended up
on a slab also!

58:16.687 --> 58:18.757
Then we have 2 murders
instead of 1.

58:18.887 --> 58:20.878
Thanks to your
precious Mike Logan.

58:21.087 --> 58:23.555
Look, why are you trying
to hide from me the fact.

58:23.767 --> 58:25.678
That Mike was
your boy-friend.

58:25.887 --> 58:28.355
Are all you girls
today so stupid?

58:28.967 --> 58:29.683
Listen.

58:29.887 --> 58:33.277
6 Weeks ago, your precious
little Mike ripped off

58:33.487 --> 58:36.479
a 100.000 Dollars from
a Brooklyn Mob and

58:36.567 --> 58:37.477
they're all over the city

58:37.567 --> 58:39.558
these days headhunting
for him.

58:39.767 --> 58:44.887
That can't be.
6 Weeks ago, I was pregnant.

58:45.087 --> 58:47.555
And Mike made me
get rid of it.

58:47.687 --> 58:49.564
He said he was broke.

58:49.767 --> 58:52.759
That with no security he'd
be damned if he

58:52.887 --> 58:54.878
brought kids into the world.

58:55.087 --> 58:57.681
Mike was loaded.
Too loaded.

58:59.287 --> 59:03.963
Ok. Come on. Tell me.
Tell me where he is.

59:04.967 --> 59:09.279
Up to 3 weeks ago
he was in Bogota,

59:09.487 --> 59:10.681
in Columbia.

59:10.767 --> 59:12.883
He called me one night and
said he was going

59:12.967 --> 59:16.164
into the Amazon. Paraguay.

59:16.367 --> 59:19.882
Yeah I think that was the
name of the place.

59:21.567 --> 59:22.761
Wait here!

59:25.887 --> 59:26.683
Bill.

59:26.887 --> 59:29.355
I want you to telex
Interpol in Bogota.

59:29.407 --> 59:31.159
Put a tracer on
a Mike Logan.

59:31.367 --> 59:33.164
Presumed to be in Paraguay.

59:33.287 --> 59:34.686
You can get the
mud details from Ross.

59:34.887 --> 59:35.683
Got it?

59:35.887 --> 59:39.766
Hell all I've been doing
is telexing Bogota.

59:39.967 --> 59:42.276
Last night about
three students who drove off

59:42.367 --> 59:44.164
in their range rover
disappeared.

59:44.287 --> 59:46.676
And now this Logan jerk.

59:47.767 --> 59:50.281
How do you spell that
Paraguay?

59:50.367 --> 59:51.561
Don't worry how you
spell it, uh!

59:51.687 --> 59:52.961
Just hurry it up!

01:00:13.367 --> 01:00:15.278
What are they doing to him?

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:17.682
Corterizing the wound.

01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:20.076
Otherwise he'd
bleed to death!

01:00:32.287 --> 01:00:35.165
Will we be tortured
like that? Or be killed?

01:01:13.567 --> 01:01:16.559
Rudy!
Where are they taking us?

01:01:16.687 --> 01:01:18.359
I don't know!

01:01:19.487 --> 01:01:22.957
I dropped my chain necklace
back in the village.

01:01:23.087 --> 01:01:27.877
And also my sunglasses
and credit card!

01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.965
Our only hope is
for someone to find them.

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:34.285
Only if someone notices
we disappeared.

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:37.162
If it's not
too late already.

01:01:37.287 --> 01:01:42.566
Anyway, whenever we get
a chance one of us has to

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:44.280
make a break for it.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:45.880
Try to find help.

01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:26.876
We're gonna land. Listen!

01:02:26.967 --> 01:02:28.082
I think I can make it.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:30.881
No Rudy. Don't!
It's too dangerous.

01:02:31.287 --> 01:02:33.482
We'll never get out
of this alive.

01:02:33.887 --> 01:02:35.957
Can't lose anything
by trying.

01:02:36.967 --> 01:02:40.880
Help me.
Distract their attention.

01:02:41.087 --> 01:02:42.679
Just before we touch.

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:46.277
Yell like crazy and dump
yourself into the water.

01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:48.366
Ok, sis?

01:02:49.167 --> 01:02:50.361
Ok!

01:04:48.287 --> 01:04:53.077
Help Me. For god's sake.
Help me!

01:04:56.887 --> 01:04:58.161
Do something.

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:03.681
Rudy! Oh please help him!

01:05:12.087 --> 01:05:13.566
Rudy!

01:06:16.287 --> 01:06:17.561
Gloria!

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:23.676
Gloria!

01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:41.959
Are you hurt?

01:06:42.087 --> 01:06:43.964
No it's nothing.

01:06:51.367 --> 01:06:53.164
I don't wanna be killed.

01:06:53.287 --> 01:06:54.481
I don't wanna be killed.

01:06:54.687 --> 01:06:55.881
Help me Gloria. Help me!

01:06:55.967 --> 01:06:57.878
Oh Pat. Don't cry Pat.

01:06:59.767 --> 01:07:02.361
I'm so scared
- Calm down.

01:07:05.167 --> 01:07:08.284
Water, Water!

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:12.955
Give me some water.
I am so thirsty. Please!

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:14.486
I'll kill you!

01:07:19.487 --> 01:07:20.283
Starvation.

01:07:20.367 --> 01:07:22.676
We'll just shrivel up
and die in here!

01:07:23.087 --> 01:07:24.156
Damn fool.

01:07:24.287 --> 01:07:25.163
What'd you say?

01:07:25.287 --> 01:07:27.881
What a god damn fool I was.

01:07:28.287 --> 01:07:31.359
Thinking I had to leave NY
to find the reasons behind

01:07:31.407 --> 01:07:32.681
Cannibalism.

01:07:32.887 --> 01:07:36.562
Do you realise, it's us,
the so called civilized people

01:07:36.687 --> 01:07:38.757
who are responsible for
their cruelty...

01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:41.685
That is not... us
and our superior society.

01:07:41.767 --> 01:07:43.280
But that's completely nuts.

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:47.155
No.
Violence breeds violence.

01:07:56.887 --> 01:08:00.880
No Don't.
It could be Rudy's!

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:09.279
No. No Please I can't.
I can't take this anymore.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:15.281
I can't take it anymore.
I want out of here.

01:08:16.087 --> 01:08:18.282
I wanna get out!

01:08:18.567 --> 01:08:22.276
No Pat. Don't cry dear.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:24.886
Let's sing something.

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:27.276
Sing? Yes, sing.

01:08:27.487 --> 01:08:29.876
To keep our spirits up and
show they can't

01:08:29.966 --> 01:08:31.366
break us down.

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.760
Alright?

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.358
Ah, I recognise this
gentleman.

01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:09.478
He was here
about 3 weeks ago, madam,

01:10:09.687 --> 01:10:10.676
with another blonde guy.

01:10:10.767 --> 01:10:12.485
But now I don't know where
they could be,

01:10:12.567 --> 01:10:13.682
but the others...

01:10:13.887 --> 01:10:16.355
As I informed the consul
they left with the jeep

01:10:16.407 --> 01:10:18.557
searching for the Mañyoca river

01:10:19.087 --> 01:10:20.486
I don't know more.

01:10:20.567 --> 01:10:22.285
I understand, Sergeant

01:10:22.367 --> 01:10:23.482
What did he say?

01:10:23.687 --> 01:10:24.756
Mike Logan
and Joseph Castellani

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.081
did come through here.

01:10:26.287 --> 01:10:27.083
And so did the others.

01:10:27.287 --> 01:10:28.959
But he doesn't know
where they went.

01:10:29.087 --> 01:10:30.361
Bad conversation, madam,

01:10:30.487 --> 01:10:32.876
in Amazonas people ignore
the danger and sometimes

01:10:32.967 --> 01:10:34.559
they pay with their lives.

01:10:34.687 --> 01:10:35.881
I'm sorry.

01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.076
What can we do?

01:10:37.287 --> 01:10:39.118
Sergeant,
this is a police matter.

01:10:39.167 --> 01:10:40.964
You have to take
these children back,

01:10:41.167 --> 01:10:42.236
right now!

01:10:42.287 --> 01:10:44.243
Where... and how?

01:10:44.287 --> 01:10:45.959
You don't have a helicopter?

01:10:46.007 --> 01:10:47.645
A guide who knows the area?

01:10:47.687 --> 01:10:49.962
Señorita don't worry.
We have the seaplane...

01:10:50.087 --> 01:10:51.076
We'll bring them back

01:10:51.287 --> 01:10:52.163
Captain?

01:10:52.767 --> 01:10:54.086
Yes sergeant

01:10:54.287 --> 01:10:56.278
Order the seaplane,
we leave now

01:10:56.367 --> 01:10:57.277
Ok.

01:12:13.087 --> 01:12:15.078
You hear that?
There is someone coming!

01:12:25.287 --> 01:12:27.278
You got it? Yeah!

01:12:43.167 --> 01:12:46.557
Mike! Pull us out.

01:12:47.287 --> 01:12:49.278
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

01:12:50.487 --> 01:12:52.682
No. Mike!

01:13:18.567 --> 01:13:20.285
Why are you turning?

01:13:20.367 --> 01:13:21.277
We're heading back.

01:13:21.487 --> 01:13:23.284
They couldn't have
gotten beyond this point.

01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:24.966
Jungle is too dense.

01:13:26.567 --> 01:13:27.682
Hold on.

01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:29.962
Let's make a last try
a little to the south.

01:13:30.167 --> 01:13:31.885
Have you got
enough gas for that?

01:13:32.087 --> 01:13:33.156
Yes.

01:13:55.087 --> 01:13:59.956
Help! Hey, I'm here.
Help me!

01:14:02.367 --> 01:14:06.076
I'm down here. Come back.

01:14:29.287 --> 01:14:31.562
Nothing. I think we're
wasting our time.

01:14:31.687 --> 01:14:33.279
Wanna turn back to
Paraguay?

01:14:33.367 --> 01:14:35.278
No. Not yet!

01:15:22.967 --> 01:15:25.276
I was dreaming
of our house.

01:15:25.687 --> 01:15:28.565
Up in Butternut Hill.
In New Jersey.

01:15:30.087 --> 01:15:31.679
And my old man was
standing there balling

01:15:31.887 --> 01:15:33.286
and spying at me.

01:15:33.367 --> 01:15:34.959
And he was saying:
Come here

01:15:35.087 --> 01:15:36.679
and let daddy hold you.

01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:38.287
You're forgiven Patricia!

01:15:38.288 --> 01:15:39.481
Forgiven?

01:15:39.567 --> 01:15:43.276
On my 16th birthday
I took off with this Johnny.

01:15:43.767 --> 01:15:45.166
It's been so long.

01:15:45.367 --> 01:15:47.164
You know I haven't thought
about my dad for more

01:15:47.367 --> 01:15:49.562
than 3 years. Since he died.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.078
He was bedridden for months.

01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:54.283
Didn't ask one word
about me.

01:15:54.687 --> 01:15:57.759
You were very fond of him,
weren't you?

01:16:01.287 --> 01:16:02.686
Yeah.

01:16:47.287 --> 01:16:49.357
Don't hurt me, please!

01:17:23.087 --> 01:17:24.361
Gloria!

01:17:27.287 --> 01:17:28.686
Gloria!

01:17:30.087 --> 01:17:32.362
No. No!

01:18:11.287 --> 01:18:13.357
Look, there it is.
On the right.

01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:17.879
Can you take us
down over there?

01:18:18.087 --> 01:18:19.287
Have you got enough space?

01:18:19.288 --> 01:18:20.879
I'll try. Hang on.

01:19:23.487 --> 01:19:26.285
It was Davison's.
I recognize the plate!

01:19:38.887 --> 01:19:42.084
Mr. Wilson.
I gave this watch to Mike.

01:19:42.287 --> 01:19:44.755
I had his initials
engraved in the casing.

01:19:48.287 --> 01:19:52.166
Sancho.
Can you talk to him?

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.039
See if he knows anything?

01:19:54.087 --> 01:19:56.476
Ask him where he found
these things, could you?

01:20:13.967 --> 01:20:15.241
What is it he's saying?

01:20:15.287 --> 01:20:17.676
He said there were
five people in a canoe.

01:20:17.887 --> 01:20:20.082
It was overturned
and they were all eaten

01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.282
by crocodiles.

01:20:21.487 --> 01:20:23.159
God in Heaven.

01:20:23.687 --> 01:20:25.757
Then there is
nothing else to do.

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.479
Let's go back to Paraguay.

01:20:37.287 --> 01:20:41.485
Oh God.
Please let her die soon.

01:20:42.087 --> 01:20:44.760
Oh let her die soon.

01:20:46.087 --> 01:20:49.284
And let me die soon too,
please!

01:23:40.087 --> 01:23:44.365
No!

01:23:45.687 --> 01:23:49.362
Don't die now.
No. Please. No!

01:23:49.407 --> 01:23:51.284
Don't die!

01:24:08.767 --> 01:24:10.280
Come on now, sis.

01:24:10.367 --> 01:24:13.279
After all Stanley found
what's his name, didn't he?

01:24:13.487 --> 01:24:18.766
It's a round world.
You can'tjust fall off.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.156
You said we can get
over $500 for him?

01:25:07.287 --> 01:25:08.356
Oh, at least.

01:25:09.487 --> 01:25:11.364
Can't wait till I
get the fuck out of

01:25:11.407 --> 01:25:12.556
this poisoned Paradise.

01:25:12.767 --> 01:25:15.759
I'll fly right up to Acapulco
and Taiwan for 10 days.

01:25:23.087 --> 01:25:24.281
That ain't no holler man.

01:25:24.367 --> 01:25:26.085
No Monkey of any kind.

01:25:26.367 --> 01:25:27.766
Hey, Jose.

01:26:01.687 --> 01:26:04.485
Help me!

01:26:18.487 --> 01:26:21.365
We are gathered here today
for a most happy event!

01:26:21.567 --> 01:26:24.764
The awarding of a doctor's
degree in Anthropology

01:26:24.887 --> 01:26:26.240
to Miss Gloria Davis.

01:26:26.287 --> 01:26:28.960
We are overjoyed to have
Gloria back among us.

01:26:29.087 --> 01:26:32.284
Our illustrious student
miraculously survived a

01:26:32.487 --> 01:26:36.480
tragic accident that took
place just 3 months ago in

01:26:36.567 --> 01:26:38.239
the Amazon jungle.

01:26:38.287 --> 01:26:40.676
She went down to that
god forsaken area out of

01:26:40.767 --> 01:26:42.962
her love for science.

01:26:43.087 --> 01:26:47.956
To collaborate first hand
her doctoral dissertation:

01:26:48.087 --> 01:26:51.284
Cannibalism: End of a Myth.

01:26:51.487 --> 01:26:54.684
With her were her brother
Rudolph acting as

01:26:54.887 --> 01:26:57.959
research assistant and
three other courageous

01:26:58.087 --> 01:26:59.156
companions.

01:26:59.367 --> 01:27:01.562
All of whom lost their
lives when their

01:27:01.687 --> 01:27:03.245
canoe capsized.

01:27:03.287 --> 01:27:06.286
To these daring young
adventurers whose spirits

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:07.561
are with us here today, I'm sure

01:27:07.687 --> 01:27:10.679
go our heart felt
appreciation and

01:27:10.887 --> 01:27:12.366
professional applause.

01:27:12.487 --> 01:27:15.763
Gloria has understandably
decided to refrain from

01:27:15.967 --> 01:27:18.356
recounting her
harrowing ordeal.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:20.159
But what matters
is the fact, that she

01:27:20.287 --> 01:27:24.286
brought back confirmation of
the correctness of her theory

01:27:24.287 --> 01:27:28.166
Thus contributing to the
destruction of a cruel myth:

01:27:28.367 --> 01:27:30.756
The notion that man eats man.

01:27:30.967 --> 01:27:32.559
She has demonstrated in some

01:27:32.887 --> 01:27:36.880
that Anthropophagi
does not exist.

01:27:36.967 --> 01:27:41.483
Thus it is with great pride
in the name of this institute

01:27:41.567 --> 01:27:44.479
that I bestow upon
Gloria Davis

01:27:44.567 --> 01:27:45.966
the academic title of

01:27:46.087 --> 01:27:49.284
Doctor of Sciences
and Anthropology

01:27:49.487 --> 01:27:50.761
with an honourable mention

01:27:50.967 --> 01:27:53.083
in the form of this
gold medal.

01:27:53.287 --> 01:27:54.686
Gloria!

01:27:57.487 --> 01:27:59.284
Gloria!
