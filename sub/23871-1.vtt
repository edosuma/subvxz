WEBVTT

02:17.370 --> 02:21.785
Beautiful
dreamer, wake unto me;

02:22.959 --> 02:27.795
Starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee.

03:01.664 --> 03:03.030
Henry?

03:09.839 --> 03:10.955
Henry.

03:14.385 --> 03:15.671
Henry?

03:25.271 --> 03:26.478
Henry?

03:32.945 --> 03:34.777
Darling, what is it?

03:37.283 --> 03:38.990
What are you doing?

04:10.566 --> 04:12.808
He's coming for us.

04:48.771 --> 04:52.139
I couldn't move.
I started shaking.

04:52.233 --> 04:54.441
I was getting dizzy.

04:56.570 --> 04:59.358
I was sure everyone in the
room wanted to kill me.

05:05.246 --> 05:06.908
Ahhhh!

05:07.957 --> 05:10.165
I've never been so scared.

05:25.266 --> 05:27.883
Pointless in the
end though, fear, isn't it?

05:30.229 --> 05:32.266
That's your best advice, doc?

05:34.233 --> 05:36.065
Alright.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.657
What do you
think controls you?

05:44.660 --> 05:47.403
Eh? Your body or your mind?

05:48.706 --> 05:50.823
Your money controls me, sugar.

05:52.209 --> 05:54.872
Oh! There you go. Fine.

05:54.962 --> 05:55.998
Okay, okay.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.705
I think my body and
mind control each other.

05:58.799 --> 06:00.711
Well, let's find out.

06:01.969 --> 06:03.130
Is this real?

06:03.554 --> 06:04.465
Yes.

06:04.555 --> 06:05.841
- Yes?
- Yes.

06:06.974 --> 06:09.887
The mind is incredibly creative.

06:11.979 --> 06:18.192
It can make us see situations
that appear completely real,

06:20.112 --> 06:23.947
but are in fact nothing
more than illusions,

06:25.659 --> 06:28.572
perceptions of truth.

06:29.788 --> 06:31.029
How did you do that?

06:33.918 --> 06:37.377
Sometimes we all need a little
help to see the difference

06:37.463 --> 06:40.206
between reality and illusion.

06:42.009 --> 06:44.251
And that's about taking control,

06:44.345 --> 06:48.214
about not letting
fear control you.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.765
Because fear in the end
only exists in your mind.

06:56.941 --> 06:58.933
Mmm. Alright.

06:59.026 --> 07:00.858
Sorry to say goodnight.

07:03.781 --> 07:05.693
I'm
looking for Dr Price.

07:09.119 --> 07:12.112
I'm Arthur Gates, Chief Legal
Officer of the Winchester

07:12.206 --> 07:13.993
Repeating Arms Company.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.039
Really?

07:15.125 --> 07:16.957
See you next week, sugar.

07:17.044 --> 07:18.876
You're a hard man
to reach, Dr Price.

07:18.963 --> 07:19.919
Mm hmm.

07:20.005 --> 07:21.962
Goodnight, Nancy.

07:22.049 --> 07:23.756
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

07:25.302 --> 07:26.588
I'm on sabbatical.

07:27.054 --> 07:28.420
Goodnight!

07:30.349 --> 07:31.339
What do you want?

07:31.433 --> 07:32.389
A prescription?

07:32.476 --> 07:34.092
I've come to offer
you employment.

07:35.729 --> 07:36.560
Whiskey?

07:36.647 --> 07:38.229
Ah no, thank you.

07:39.024 --> 07:41.607
Are you familiar with Sarah
Winchester, Dr Price?

07:41.694 --> 07:44.983
Ah Mrs Winchester's husband,
William, was the majority

07:45.072 --> 07:48.565
shareholder of the Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

07:49.910 --> 07:52.869
25 years ago, William passed,
leaving Mrs Winchester a rather

07:52.955 --> 07:56.699
large inheritance, and 51
percent of the company.

07:57.918 --> 08:01.082
Mrs Winchester also lost
her only child, Annie.

08:03.215 --> 08:06.299
It's said in her grief,
she turned to a medium

08:06.385 --> 08:08.877
spiritualist of some sort.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.014
The medium may have taken
advantage of her mental state.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.467
That's not uncommon
after a tragedy.

08:15.561 --> 08:18.850
I can assure you, Sarah
Winchester is anything

08:18.939 --> 08:20.396
but common.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.025
Aye, after her spiritual
encounter, she moved across the

08:24.111 --> 08:26.945
country to San Jose, where
she purchased what was...

08:27.031 --> 08:29.694
- Where's my-
- ...then an eight room house.

08:29.783 --> 08:31.194
Maybe it's in the garden room.

08:31.285 --> 08:33.902
She spent the last 20
years expanding it.

08:33.996 --> 08:39.037
Wh-what stands now is a ah
gargantuan seven storeyed

08:39.126 --> 08:43.291
structure, with no apparent
rhyme or reason, no master plan,

08:43.380 --> 08:47.624
each maze of halls more
confusing than the next.

08:48.886 --> 08:51.253
A house under never-ending
construction, built on the

08:51.347 --> 08:55.808
orders of a grieving widow,
whose mind is as chaotic

08:55.893 --> 08:57.600
as the house itself.

08:57.686 --> 09:00.599
Over the years, she's become
more and more reclusive.

09:00.689 --> 09:04.148
Last month, the Board of
Directors enacted its right to

09:04.234 --> 09:08.478
assess Mrs Winchester's state
of mind, to determine if she's

09:08.572 --> 09:10.029
fit to control the company.

09:11.075 --> 09:13.317
You want to take
it away from her?

09:14.328 --> 09:16.911
We're worried about
her sanity, Dr Price.

09:18.832 --> 09:20.915
We need a professional.

09:22.419 --> 09:25.332
Any kind of diagnosis from
such a long distance

09:25.422 --> 09:26.879
would be impossible.

09:26.965 --> 09:29.582
Well, Mrs Winchester has
agreed to let you stay at the

09:29.677 --> 09:32.761
residence, an offer
that is exceedingly rare.

09:35.516 --> 09:37.724
An unwilling patient,
the long distance.

09:37.810 --> 09:39.642
This is, this is, this is
not something ordinarily I...

09:39.728 --> 09:40.718
Name the amount.

09:40.813 --> 09:41.894
Doesn't really work like that.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.391
How much do you owe?

09:44.858 --> 09:45.769
Mortgage?

09:45.859 --> 09:47.771
Hospital expenses?

09:49.363 --> 09:50.570
Medicine?

09:51.782 --> 09:52.818
Three hundred.

09:52.908 --> 09:54.490
We'll pay six...

09:55.369 --> 09:56.985
for the appropriate assessment.

10:45.586 --> 10:48.704
Mrs Winchester
requests the bay window frame be

10:48.797 --> 10:50.709
installed by sundown.

10:50.799 --> 10:52.381
Move with haste.

11:02.102 --> 11:03.968
Let me get that, sir.

11:04.980 --> 11:05.970
Thank you.

11:10.360 --> 11:12.602
Busy day of
construction here, sir.

11:12.696 --> 11:13.607
Yes.

11:13.697 --> 11:15.484
Days and nights are
always busy here.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.031
Really? Nights, too?

11:17.117 --> 11:19.985
Right round the clock, sir.
This way.

11:22.664 --> 11:25.077
Most of the the rooms
don't stay up very long,

11:25.167 --> 11:28.205
like Mrs Winchester's
garden room there.

11:28.837 --> 11:30.373
That might not last the season.

11:31.298 --> 11:32.334
Really?

11:34.593 --> 11:36.676
Please wait in
the library, sir.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.845
I'll call for Mrs Marriot.

12:35.696 --> 12:37.107
Jesus!

12:37.197 --> 12:38.313
My apologies, sir.

12:38.407 --> 12:40.114
The door was making
a terrible racket.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.908
No, no, no, no, no.
That's quite alright.

12:43.912 --> 12:45.198
Gave me a fright.

12:53.088 --> 12:54.169
Dr Price?

12:54.590 --> 12:55.751
Yes.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.878
Welcome. Marion Marriott,
Mrs Winchester's niece.

12:57.968 --> 13:00.802
Oh, well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

13:00.888 --> 13:04.256
I must say, I have never
quite seen a house like this.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.513
My aunt advised me of
the nature of your visit.

13:08.729 --> 13:10.470
As you are aware, it is
unfortunate timing, so I would

13:10.564 --> 13:12.931
ask you to behave in a manner
befitting the circumstance.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.482
Unfortunate, how?

13:14.568 --> 13:16.150
A tragedy occurred.

13:16.236 --> 13:18.979
Oh. Well,
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:19.072 --> 13:20.654
Are you carrying firearms?

13:21.909 --> 13:22.990
Should I be?

13:23.076 --> 13:24.317
Aunt Sarah forbids them.

13:24.411 --> 13:25.822
Well!

13:25.913 --> 13:28.405
I'm ah completely unarmed.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.407
Good.

13:30.500 --> 13:33.117
You, like I, like everyone, are
guests in Aunt Sarah's home.

13:33.211 --> 13:34.372
You will abide by her rules.

13:34.463 --> 13:35.704
Understood.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.005
You are to stay in this section
of the house, the east wing.

13:38.091 --> 13:40.003
Aunt Sarah's private
domains are off limits.

13:40.093 --> 13:41.209
Understood.

13:42.179 --> 13:45.217
So ah, are you
close to your aunt?

13:45.307 --> 13:47.970
Is this already part of
your evaluation, Dr Price?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.426
Oh no, Ma'am, it is not.

13:50.312 --> 13:51.473
Yes.

13:51.563 --> 13:53.646
Aunt Sarah is an exceptional
woman. She does not deserve

13:53.732 --> 13:56.190
to be treated with anything
less than complete respect.

13:56.860 --> 13:58.567
Yes, Ma'am. Quite right.

14:05.702 --> 14:06.943
May I?

14:10.499 --> 14:12.161
This is the grand ballroom,

14:12.250 --> 14:14.116
built almost entirely
without nails.

14:14.211 --> 14:17.124
The walls and parquet floor are
made of six separate hardwoods.

14:18.006 --> 14:20.498
The silver chandelier was
imported from Germany.

14:26.598 --> 14:27.839
Follow me, doctor.

14:28.642 --> 14:30.349
There are almost one
hundred rooms in the house.

14:30.435 --> 14:32.017
It's easy to get lost.

15:03.677 --> 15:06.135
How ah unusual!

15:07.180 --> 15:08.887
Aunt Sarah suffers
from arthritis.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.136
This makes climbing stairs
manageable for her.

15:11.226 --> 15:13.434
The house can be overwhelming.
Do keep up.

15:20.569 --> 15:22.060
What is this?

15:23.488 --> 15:25.150
It's a communication device.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.606
Really?

15:26.700 --> 15:28.987
You speak into the holes and
a series of pipes travel the

15:29.077 --> 15:31.114
sound to the desired room.

15:35.542 --> 15:36.578
Ha!

15:37.544 --> 15:39.206
Ingenious.
- Yes.

15:39.296 --> 15:41.629
You'll find many of my aunt's
inventions are state-of-the-art.

15:41.715 --> 15:44.082
I trust you'll find everything
you need with the room.

15:45.052 --> 15:46.884
Aunt Sarah will be
joining us for dinner.

15:47.929 --> 15:50.137
Perhaps you would like to
freshen up beforehand.

15:50.223 --> 15:52.385
I very much look forward
to meeting your aunt.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.052
Aunt Sarah would not approve of
you drinking before dinner hour.

15:56.146 --> 15:59.560
Her sense of smell is
still as acute as mine.

16:01.318 --> 16:02.854
Respect her wishes.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.993
You were right about me, Ruby.

16:20.545 --> 16:21.956
I am...

16:24.466 --> 16:25.798
a fraud.

16:42.025 --> 16:44.233
You're a phony, mm?

16:48.782 --> 16:50.364
Oh, that feels good!

16:55.163 --> 16:57.405
Well, you don't
know what you're doing.

17:02.087 --> 17:04.625
You don't know
what you're doing.

17:04.714 --> 17:07.297
Oh yeah.
You prove nothing.

17:09.970 --> 17:11.176
Ahhh.

17:14.891 --> 17:16.803
For Christ's sake.

17:20.689 --> 17:22.521
Christ!

18:07.360 --> 18:09.022
Who are you?
What do you want?

18:09.112 --> 18:11.570
Dinner will be
served in ten minutes.

18:12.032 --> 18:14.069
You're ah, you're alone, yes?

18:14.159 --> 18:15.149
Yes, sir.

18:15.243 --> 18:16.279
Nobody else with you?

18:16.369 --> 18:17.359
No, sir.

18:17.454 --> 18:19.241
No? You didn't see anyone
just come out of here?

18:19.331 --> 18:20.788
Are you alright, sir?

18:23.168 --> 18:25.330
I'm fine. I just
thought someone else was-

18:25.420 --> 18:28.083
Well, I thought I saw
someone else in my room. Ha!

18:29.507 --> 18:30.748
Interesting.

18:30.842 --> 18:33.459
Hmm. Look, I'm fine, yes.
Dinner in ten minutes, yes?

18:33.929 --> 18:34.840
Sir.

18:34.930 --> 18:36.216
Good, thank you.

18:42.979 --> 18:44.345
Take
it nice and easy.

18:46.441 --> 18:48.148
Phew! There.

19:05.627 --> 19:06.743
Henry!

19:07.545 --> 19:08.752
Stop it!

19:18.014 --> 19:19.425
Henry, stop that!

19:21.726 --> 19:22.591
Henry!

19:23.436 --> 19:24.802
Henry! Just-

19:27.148 --> 19:30.016
Henry, you must be very
excited to spend some time in

19:30.110 --> 19:31.976
your great aunt's house.

19:32.988 --> 19:35.196
We're here because father died.

19:39.035 --> 19:41.197
Well, I am very sorry
for your loss, young man.

19:41.788 --> 19:42.619
I'm not.

19:42.706 --> 19:43.822
Henry!

19:43.915 --> 19:46.282
It's my fault.
I didn't mean to pry.

19:47.377 --> 19:49.585
Of course you did.
That's why you're here.

19:50.964 --> 19:52.375
Yes.

19:52.465 --> 19:53.922
Suppose so.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.800
I recently lost someone myself.

19:56.886 --> 19:59.048
So if you feel like discussing
anything, I might be able to

19:59.139 --> 20:03.224
provide some assistance to
yourself or young Henry here.

20:05.103 --> 20:08.642
I imagine you must be very
good at your job if Aunt Sarah

20:08.732 --> 20:10.268
chose you to be her assessor.

20:13.236 --> 20:15.478
I had no idea she
chose me herself.

20:15.572 --> 20:17.108
I'm just hoping that I can help.

20:17.198 --> 20:20.191
If you want to help, doctor, you
can give my aunt a clean bill

20:20.285 --> 20:22.368
of health and be on your way.

20:23.204 --> 20:25.446
Well, I have a duty to my
profession and an obligation

20:25.540 --> 20:26.872
to my employers.

20:28.209 --> 20:30.121
Aunt Sarah is your employer.

20:31.421 --> 20:33.208
It is still half her company.

20:47.270 --> 20:48.511
Madam!

20:54.778 --> 20:55.894
Good evening, madam.

21:30.897 --> 21:32.308
Dr Price.

21:32.399 --> 21:34.812
Mrs Winchester, it's a
pleasure to finally meet you.

21:34.901 --> 21:36.893
The pleasure is due to the
lawyers of the Winchester

21:36.986 --> 21:38.693
Repeating Arms Company.

21:40.949 --> 21:41.985
Yes.

21:42.075 --> 21:43.737
That's probably right.

21:45.036 --> 21:47.619
I hope everything has been
to your satisfaction so far?

21:47.705 --> 21:49.822
I cannot fault the hospitality.

21:49.916 --> 21:53.000
It's quite a special
house, is it not?

21:54.129 --> 21:57.042
Now that, Ma'am, is a
fact beyond dispute.

21:59.759 --> 22:00.966
Thank you.

22:03.096 --> 22:05.634
I understand the Winchester is
still considered the superior

22:05.723 --> 22:07.510
rifle on the market, Ma'am.

22:07.600 --> 22:08.932
Superior?

22:10.645 --> 22:12.227
Superior at what?

22:13.523 --> 22:16.482
Accuracy, range, stopping power.

22:16.568 --> 22:17.604
Killing.

22:17.694 --> 22:19.777
Indiscriminate killing.

22:21.197 --> 22:22.654
Very superior.

22:23.241 --> 22:26.530
You feel responsible for
the misuse of your product?

22:27.662 --> 22:30.826
If a weapon works as intended,
one can hardly call it a misuse.

22:30.915 --> 22:33.282
Well, it can
be used for good or bad,

22:33.376 --> 22:35.368
depending on the
person wielding it.

22:38.298 --> 22:39.539
Yes.

22:40.633 --> 22:42.670
Then again, perhaps
roller-skates are a less

22:42.760 --> 22:44.001
dangerous endeavor.

22:44.095 --> 22:47.805
The company is expanding,
looking for other opportunities.

22:47.891 --> 22:50.304
I understand that was at
your behest, Mrs Winchester?

22:50.393 --> 22:52.931
It was.
To the displeasure of the board.

22:53.021 --> 22:57.015
It appears that strapping wheels
to one's feet can also be a,

22:57.108 --> 22:59.020
a perilous endeavor.

23:01.613 --> 23:02.820
Hear, hear.

23:22.884 --> 23:25.467
Tell me the
story about the farmer

23:25.553 --> 23:27.169
who owned the old mule.

23:27.263 --> 23:28.094
No.

23:28.181 --> 23:30.138
I always liked that story.

23:31.351 --> 23:33.843
- A delusional disorder.
- Yes.

23:33.937 --> 23:35.678
- That's what you called it.
- Yes.

23:36.981 --> 23:39.940
I don't want to talk anymore.
I need you to believe me.

23:40.026 --> 23:42.518
I want to be with you, Ruby.

23:42.612 --> 23:44.194
Together forever.

24:13.560 --> 24:14.767
Hello?

24:28.908 --> 24:30.570
Hello?

25:11.284 --> 25:12.274
Ah!

27:05.064 --> 27:06.475
Oh! Christ!

27:12.697 --> 27:14.689
Oh, you've poisoned
your mind, Eric;

27:14.782 --> 27:16.398
you've poisoned your mind!

27:16.492 --> 27:18.108
I need some air.

28:39.784 --> 28:42.117
Ohhh! Ohhh! DÃ©jÃ -vu!

29:03.850 --> 29:04.590
Hey!

30:13.961 --> 30:14.667
Hey!

30:16.964 --> 30:18.375
Hey!!

30:19.216 --> 30:20.002
Move, hey!

30:20.092 --> 30:21.253
Move! Move!

30:22.637 --> 30:23.718
Ahhh!

30:24.388 --> 30:25.845
Ohhh!

30:29.685 --> 30:31.301
I see you!

30:36.692 --> 30:37.773
Oh! Henry!

30:37.860 --> 30:38.771
Darling!

30:41.656 --> 30:43.898
What's happening
to you, sweetheart?

30:44.659 --> 30:45.866
Ohhh!

30:49.497 --> 30:50.829
Thank you.

30:54.835 --> 30:56.952
Darling, what's
happening to you?

31:02.468 --> 31:06.007
Mrs Winchester, I really
must have your full attention.

31:06.097 --> 31:07.884
Oh, you have it, Dr Price.

31:07.974 --> 31:11.092
Yes, but perhaps you would
be more comfortable if-

31:11.185 --> 31:13.222
Last night was quite
a traumatic event.

31:13.312 --> 31:15.554
I'm grateful for your actions.

31:15.648 --> 31:20.313
I fear you may have me at a, an
emotional disadvantage today.

31:20.403 --> 31:21.860
Yes, I understand.

31:21.946 --> 31:24.484
I don't mean to pry, but has
Master Henry been prone to

31:24.573 --> 31:26.280
sleepwalking in the past?

31:27.368 --> 31:28.358
No.

31:29.578 --> 31:32.036
But you may know, he did witness
the death of his father.

31:32.832 --> 31:33.743
Yes.

31:36.544 --> 31:39.082
Well, this is the first in
a series of sessions I wish

31:39.171 --> 31:42.255
to conduct. And I can assure you
that today will be quite benign.

31:42.341 --> 31:44.958
No, no, no. Let's just get
straight to it, doctor.

31:45.052 --> 31:48.295
You are here to assess my
erratic behavior, are you not?

31:48.389 --> 31:50.346
Well, erratic behavior
is not the phrase that

31:50.433 --> 31:51.423
I would've chosen, but-

31:51.517 --> 31:53.224
No, I will
speak with you truthfully.

31:53.310 --> 31:54.221
Please.

31:54.311 --> 31:55.597
But you will do me
the same courtesy.

31:55.688 --> 31:56.769
Of course.

31:56.856 --> 31:59.394
Do you suffer from
soldier's syndrome?

31:59.942 --> 32:00.898
I'm sorry?

32:00.985 --> 32:03.568
Are you an abuser of medication?

32:04.697 --> 32:07.030
Mrs Winchester, I think it's
best if I ask the questions.

32:07.116 --> 32:09.779
Your wife, did she believe
you are a good therapist?

32:09.869 --> 32:11.701
We're not here to
discuss my wife.

32:11.787 --> 32:13.323
Your wife, Ruby?

32:15.791 --> 32:19.705
No, we are not. And I would
appreciate your honesty.

32:19.795 --> 32:22.287
Are you an abuser of medication?
- No, I'm not.

32:28.929 --> 32:30.386
So.

32:30.473 --> 32:32.510
I will share a fact with you,
which you may find questionable.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.683
But I assure you, it is a fact.

32:34.769 --> 32:35.850
Please.

32:35.936 --> 32:37.928
I am cursed.

32:38.022 --> 32:39.638
Cursed, how?

32:39.732 --> 32:41.439
Have you read my papers?

32:41.525 --> 32:43.141
- Of course I have.
- And what did they say?

32:43.235 --> 32:45.773
Well, among many things, they
say that this is the house

32:45.863 --> 32:47.229
that spirits built.

32:47.323 --> 32:50.782
See, profiting from such a
thing as violence and death,

32:50.868 --> 32:55.704
oh, that is a wickedness that
follows you like a shadow.

32:56.791 --> 32:58.999
Yes, we might also call
those shadows 'guilt'.

32:59.752 --> 33:02.210
But tell me, how do
these shadows follow you?

33:02.296 --> 33:04.913
I may be getting old,
Dr Price, but I assure you,

33:05.007 --> 33:06.464
I have not lost my senses.

33:06.550 --> 33:09.839
I know the difference between
illusion and reality.

33:10.930 --> 33:11.966
I see.

33:15.101 --> 33:16.967
Your mind rules your body.

33:18.604 --> 33:20.687
The mind can be
incredibly creative.

33:20.773 --> 33:24.608
But it can also,
at times, fail us.

33:24.693 --> 33:26.776
My mind has never failed me.

33:26.862 --> 33:31.653
What we see, taste and
touch are interpreted and

33:31.742 --> 33:33.950
processed to give us our truth.

33:34.036 --> 33:36.995
And that truth can
in turn be an illusion,

33:37.081 --> 33:40.449
created, distorted, by grief.

33:44.922 --> 33:47.164
Do you believe in
ghosts, Dr Price?

33:47.883 --> 33:49.795
No, Ma'am. Why would I?

33:50.636 --> 33:53.595
Offering my staff that bill
would be greatly appreciated.

33:53.681 --> 33:57.174
Even the nickel inside the bill
would be a respectable start.

33:59.854 --> 34:01.436
Oh really!
Silly illusions!

34:01.522 --> 34:03.309
Do you take me for a fool?

34:03.399 --> 34:04.389
No, Ma'am. I do not.

34:04.483 --> 34:06.395
No more diversions from reality.

34:06.485 --> 34:07.692
No more parlor tricks.

34:07.778 --> 34:10.235
And your medication will
have to be confiscated.

34:10.322 --> 34:12.780
Mrs Winchester, I'm sorry, but
I must insist, I'm not a child...

34:12.867 --> 34:13.947
This is my home, Dr Price.

34:14.034 --> 34:16.822
And I will not be...
- You will obey my rules.

34:18.205 --> 34:21.289
If you want me to open up this
house for you, you need clarity.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.333
Do you have another
question for me?

34:29.341 --> 34:30.797
Yes, Ma'am.

34:34.972 --> 34:37.760
Is it really necessary to
confine me to quarters?

34:37.850 --> 34:40.137
It is Madam's wish, sir.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.351
Hmmm.

34:42.438 --> 34:44.600
And the condition
of Master Henry?

34:44.690 --> 34:47.228
He too is confined to quarters.

34:47.318 --> 34:49.731
And Mrs Marriott has
not left his side.

35:19.642 --> 35:20.758
Dammit!

35:34.073 --> 35:37.111
Sir, the members of the board
eagerly await your evaluation.

35:37.201 --> 35:39.158
I trust you will make
an accurate assessment.

35:39.245 --> 35:41.658
Regards, Arthur C Gates,
Chief Legal Officer.

35:53.384 --> 35:56.092
Sarah Winchester's
psychological assessment and

35:56.178 --> 35:57.965
mental status examination.

35:58.055 --> 36:01.844
Dr Eric A Price, April 16, 1906.

36:02.726 --> 36:05.184
Appearance, normal.

36:05.271 --> 36:07.809
Hygiene, physical
characteristics, all normal.

36:07.898 --> 36:10.891
Patient struggles with the
loss of her husband and child.

36:10.985 --> 36:13.853
Her behavior is at times
slightly aggressive.

36:13.946 --> 36:16.984
Perception, visual
hallucinations that patient

36:17.074 --> 36:19.737
often refers to as
shadows or ghosts.

36:21.870 --> 36:24.829
I feel them, their presence.

36:33.173 --> 36:34.289
Go on.

36:39.054 --> 36:41.797
I feel their presence,
their energy.

36:42.850 --> 36:45.809
Their unfinished business
has brought them here.

36:47.146 --> 36:49.058
Do you perhaps in any way blame
them for the death of your

36:49.148 --> 36:50.639
husband and child?

36:50.733 --> 36:54.727
I will mourn William
and dear Annie always.

36:54.820 --> 36:58.530
I love all my family
very much, Dr Price.

36:58.615 --> 37:00.982
They are the true
riches of my life,

37:01.076 --> 37:04.285
and I will do whatever
it takes to protect them.

37:19.011 --> 37:22.049
Can you tell me why ah, why
those bells chime at midnight?

37:22.139 --> 37:24.051
It's midnight, sir.

37:24.683 --> 37:25.764
Well, yes.

37:25.851 --> 37:29.185
But is there any
significance to it?

37:29.980 --> 37:31.812
It's midnight, sir.

37:35.944 --> 37:36.980
Thank you.

40:58.772 --> 41:01.139
I swear, the laudanum
is still in my system.

41:01.233 --> 41:02.724
Ahhh, ahhh.

41:02.818 --> 41:06.027
Let's just hope
it's withdrawals.

41:06.113 --> 41:09.072
It always was withdrawals
- it had to be.

41:09.157 --> 41:11.023
Had to be.

41:14.496 --> 41:16.954
I have a question
for you, Dr Price.

41:17.040 --> 41:18.656
Again, Mrs Winchester,
it's best if I ask-

41:18.750 --> 41:20.491
What is it like to die?

41:20.586 --> 41:21.667
Talking about your...

41:21.753 --> 41:24.370
Deceased for three
minutes, were you not?

41:28.093 --> 41:31.552
You know, I keep records

41:31.638 --> 41:34.472
of all the lives a
Winchester has taken.

41:35.934 --> 41:39.018
Hundreds have been reported;
probably thousands haven't.

41:40.772 --> 41:44.641
The guilty, the innocent - the
rifle doesn't discriminate.

41:44.735 --> 41:47.899
And many of the souls make
their way to this house.

41:47.988 --> 41:49.479
That's impressive.

41:50.741 --> 41:53.279
As you can clearly see,
I am still here. So perhaps

41:53.368 --> 41:56.281
you could do me the kindness
of taking me off that shelf.

41:57.456 --> 41:59.118
You were shot.

41:59.207 --> 42:00.618
I was.

42:07.424 --> 42:08.585
This.

42:09.885 --> 42:11.626
And it did kill me.

42:16.516 --> 42:19.429
You kept it and refurbished it.

42:20.312 --> 42:21.598
I did.

42:21.688 --> 42:22.724
Why?

42:22.814 --> 42:25.272
Well, because it's a
reminder of my past.

42:25.359 --> 42:29.649
Because it's my connection to
death and to all that I've lost.

42:31.948 --> 42:34.611
Instruments of death
have a powerful connection

42:34.701 --> 42:36.317
to the afterlife.

42:39.247 --> 42:42.490
We hold onto mementoes
to help us heal.

42:42.584 --> 42:45.327
But sometimes, they do
more harm than good.

42:45.420 --> 42:46.831
Precisely.

42:46.922 --> 42:50.415
So tell me, what do you think
it is you're holding onto?

42:54.262 --> 42:56.424
Have you ever been
to a spiritualist?

42:57.933 --> 42:59.925
But I understand you have.

43:00.018 --> 43:02.852
You know, it is believed that
once we've departed this world,

43:02.938 --> 43:07.308
we can see others who have left
their physical selves behind.

43:07.401 --> 43:08.562
Is that right?

43:08.652 --> 43:11.269
Have you ever
experienced such a thing?

43:11.363 --> 43:13.650
I can't say that I have, no.

43:14.366 --> 43:16.528
Is it painful to die?

43:17.577 --> 43:20.320
Mrs Winchester, w-we really must
continue with this evaluation.

43:20.414 --> 43:22.326
Please, doctor. Please.

43:22.416 --> 43:23.657
Yes.

43:26.378 --> 43:27.960
And then nothing.

43:30.090 --> 43:31.706
Just a calmness.

43:32.718 --> 43:35.756
And when I came back,
it was painful again.

43:37.222 --> 43:39.179
If that makes sense.

43:40.100 --> 43:41.341
Yes.

43:44.688 --> 43:47.601
Yes, because you too have
experienced great pain.

43:48.775 --> 43:52.860
Oh, grief can be far more
crippling than arthritis,

43:52.946 --> 43:54.153
doctor.

43:54.239 --> 43:57.232
Mrs Winchester, do you blame the
shadows for the loss of your

43:57.325 --> 43:59.112
husband and child?

44:01.079 --> 44:03.412
Were you out of your
room last night?

44:08.253 --> 44:10.085
Yes, I was.

44:10.881 --> 44:12.292
Thank you.

44:12.382 --> 44:14.624
Thank you for
telling me the truth.

44:25.437 --> 44:27.770
So, why all the noise?

44:27.856 --> 44:29.643
Why all this construction?

44:29.733 --> 44:31.816
They want me to build, doctor.

44:31.902 --> 44:36.738
The spirits killed by
the rifle, they guide me.

44:38.074 --> 44:40.862
Guide you in drawing
building plans?

44:40.952 --> 44:42.068
Yes.

44:43.205 --> 44:44.616
What? Why?

44:44.706 --> 44:47.699
For the rooms, of course.
You see, once their

44:47.793 --> 44:50.911
rooms are completed, their
presence grows stronger.

44:52.255 --> 44:54.417
Hence the house
that spirits built?

44:54.508 --> 44:55.874
Yes.

44:56.718 --> 45:00.678
The shadows that follow me,
they have unfinished business.

45:01.556 --> 45:03.923
You saw what I did
last night, didn't you?

45:04.643 --> 45:06.100
I did.

45:07.187 --> 45:09.554
At the chime of
midnight, they clamor.

45:10.857 --> 45:12.814
The bells summon them.

45:13.944 --> 45:17.904
They communicate
through plans, drawings.

45:19.199 --> 45:22.533
They want me to reconstruct
the rooms that they died in,

45:22.619 --> 45:25.202
then they can enter our world.

45:26.122 --> 45:27.738
And the trouble is, I
don't always know who it is

45:27.833 --> 45:30.621
I'm speaking with.
I-it could be some innocent

45:30.710 --> 45:35.000
bystander or, or
a victim of a crime, or...

45:38.552 --> 45:40.134
someone else.

45:40.220 --> 45:42.132
Who else, Mrs Winchester?

45:43.223 --> 45:46.887
Last night, a spirit more
powerful than any I've

45:46.977 --> 45:50.220
encountered
endangered my family.

45:52.357 --> 45:53.939
Who are you?

45:55.652 --> 46:00.363
Doctor, who do you see in
this room at this moment?

46:01.032 --> 46:02.443
Just you.

46:04.369 --> 46:05.405
Only me?

46:15.297 --> 46:16.663
Just you.

46:17.799 --> 46:19.506
It will take time.

46:20.135 --> 46:22.218
You still need to
clear your head.

46:41.990 --> 46:43.322
Oh, sir!

46:44.242 --> 46:46.234
I would like to check in on
Mrs Marriott and Master Henry,

46:46.328 --> 46:46.988
if I may.

46:47.078 --> 46:48.785
I will enquire, sir.

46:48.872 --> 46:51.489
Perhaps, may I ask
you a question?

46:52.542 --> 46:53.658
Question, sir?

46:53.752 --> 46:57.587
Yes. I mean tell me, have you
ever seen any, any ghosts?

46:58.673 --> 47:00.505
No, sir.

47:01.635 --> 47:04.628
But you have heard the
rumors, the stories?

47:04.721 --> 47:07.384
I have heard tall tales.

47:07.974 --> 47:10.341
Some taller than others.

47:11.519 --> 47:14.102
Have you ever witnessed
anything out of the ordinary?

47:21.655 --> 47:25.615
So display cabinets along the
walls and then a line of them

47:25.700 --> 47:27.282
down the middle of the room.

47:27.369 --> 47:29.235
Yes, Ma'am.

47:29.329 --> 47:32.538
And ah what type of Winchester
would you like delivered?

47:34.459 --> 47:36.826
Every type, every model.

47:39.297 --> 47:41.038
Okay, let's go back.

47:41.925 --> 47:44.759
Tell me please what happens
once these rooms are finished?

47:44.844 --> 47:48.554
Well, the spirit's presence
grows more powerful and

47:48.640 --> 47:50.472
more... more focused.

47:50.558 --> 47:52.891
Their voices get stronger.

47:52.978 --> 47:54.094
And we converse.

47:54.187 --> 47:56.679
Converse how? About what?

47:56.773 --> 47:59.641
I show them my deep remorse.

48:00.986 --> 48:04.354
I want to help them let go of
their grief and their anger.

48:04.447 --> 48:05.733
And how do they react?

48:05.824 --> 48:07.235
Favorably.

48:07.325 --> 48:09.191
Yes, mostly.

48:09.285 --> 48:11.777
Once they are at peace,
then they can move on.

48:11.871 --> 48:14.284
We can tear down their room
and then we start again.

48:15.208 --> 48:17.996
And are there those that
don't react so favorably?

48:19.713 --> 48:21.170
Yes.

48:21.256 --> 48:23.748
Yes, we lock them away.

48:23.842 --> 48:25.879
How does one lock a spirit away?

48:25.969 --> 48:28.632
Thirteen nails seals them in.

48:28.722 --> 48:31.556
Once they find peace, we can
release them and they can

48:31.641 --> 48:33.052
leave this house.

48:33.143 --> 48:36.477
So thirteen is a devilish number
to protect you from devils?

48:36.563 --> 48:38.725
No, no, no.
That is a divine number,

48:38.815 --> 48:42.024
to protect the cycle
of life and death.

48:42.110 --> 48:44.102
And does this divine
number always work?

48:44.195 --> 48:47.688
I mean what if a spirit simply
doesn't want to be locked away?

48:49.492 --> 48:54.578
The unmendable souls prey upon
the innocent and the pure.

48:55.832 --> 48:58.040
And by the innocent and
pure, you mean Master Henry?

49:01.337 --> 49:03.249
We can stand between them.

49:03.339 --> 49:05.672
I and you.

49:07.010 --> 49:10.299
With your assistance, I can
help this spirit find peace.

49:16.227 --> 49:18.890
You don't believe
any of this. I understand.

49:18.980 --> 49:20.312
Ma'am, I do not.

49:20.398 --> 49:25.063
I do not believe in anything
I cannot see or study.

49:26.237 --> 49:29.105
Mrs Winchester, you have built
this house, th-this place,

49:29.199 --> 49:32.158
this reality. Therefore, you
can control it, can you not?

49:33.036 --> 49:34.698
Yes, perhaps.

49:35.288 --> 49:37.701
We all have the ability
to create and control

49:37.791 --> 49:40.454
our own reality. But for some,
for you, Mrs Winchester,

49:40.543 --> 49:43.832
for you, that will
mean letting go of the past.

49:45.381 --> 49:47.338
Make your assessment, doctor.

49:49.427 --> 49:52.966
Say what you feel is the
truth about Sarah Winchester.

49:54.099 --> 49:56.807
And if that means you lose
control of your company?

49:56.893 --> 49:58.259
Oh!

49:58.353 --> 50:01.266
There are worse things in this
world to lose than that, doctor.

50:08.738 --> 50:10.354
I see you've finished
the new room.

50:10.448 --> 50:12.531
Of course.

50:13.118 --> 50:15.451
Must be very
profitable for you,

50:16.329 --> 50:17.911
all this working
round the clock.

50:18.706 --> 50:22.165
We all appreciate Mrs
Winchester's ongoing employment,

50:22.252 --> 50:24.915
and her creativity.

50:26.172 --> 50:28.505
I must say, that creativity
certainly leads to some

50:28.591 --> 50:29.923
rather odd designs.

50:30.969 --> 50:33.177
Do you think it possible a
woman of advancing years may be

50:33.263 --> 50:35.755
susceptible to flights of fancy?

50:35.849 --> 50:37.511
No, sir.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.011
I do not.

50:42.105 --> 50:44.813
Could I see inside the
garden room, please?

50:44.899 --> 50:47.061
I had one similar
and I would be much obliged...

50:47.152 --> 50:49.735
No, sir.
That room is sealed.

50:49.821 --> 50:52.313
Therefore it's off limits.

50:52.824 --> 50:54.736
Good day, doctor.

50:59.747 --> 51:02.034
Well, Eric, that's
going really well.

51:16.681 --> 51:17.717
How is he?

51:19.184 --> 51:20.766
Fine.
Resting.

51:20.852 --> 51:23.890
Has he ever been prone to
behavior like that in the past?

51:24.856 --> 51:25.892
No.

51:25.982 --> 51:27.314
Never?

51:29.819 --> 51:33.278
She told you, didn't she,
about the Winchester curse?

51:34.199 --> 51:35.235
Yes.

51:35.325 --> 51:38.159
Do you believe her, or
do you think she's crazy?

51:38.244 --> 51:41.157
I think crazy is
a dangerous word.

51:42.123 --> 51:45.457
People have certain medical
conditions and with the right

51:45.543 --> 51:47.660
diagnosis and treatment,
they can be helped.

51:52.550 --> 51:55.008
I do not believe
in curses, doctor.

51:55.094 --> 51:59.509
Good. Nor do I. I think
perhaps your son's behavior

51:59.599 --> 52:02.387
has been triggered by the
sudden death of his father.

52:02.936 --> 52:04.472
Yes.

52:04.562 --> 52:07.555
Could you tell me how
your husband died?

52:07.649 --> 52:13.771
He had demons, but not the kind
that my aunt believes haunt her.

52:16.991 --> 52:18.232
Go on.

52:18.326 --> 52:22.445
Aunt Sarah's husband died
suddenly of tuberculosis.

52:22.538 --> 52:25.155
And then she lost poor Annie.

52:26.626 --> 52:29.960
She believes our family
curse is spreading.

52:39.514 --> 52:43.474
My, my husband loved the drink
more than his wife and child.

52:44.269 --> 52:46.352
I believe that was his curse.

52:48.147 --> 52:52.767
Now he is gone,
and I'm alone,

52:52.860 --> 52:55.318
better off in so
many ways without him.

52:56.281 --> 52:57.988
But it terrifies me.

52:58.074 --> 53:00.407
Don't let that fear control you.

53:01.286 --> 53:04.154
Hey, fear only
exists in your mind.

53:05.290 --> 53:08.124
When we fear the most,
we must take control.

53:09.919 --> 53:12.536
You can be a fighter.
You can be a protector.

53:12.630 --> 53:14.747
I do not feel like a protector.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.792
Aunt Sarah is the fighter.

53:18.344 --> 53:19.425
Yes.

53:19.512 --> 53:21.424
She would die to save us.

53:21.514 --> 53:22.971
Perhaps.

53:23.057 --> 53:26.425
Have you ever loved someone so
much you would die to save them?

53:28.479 --> 53:29.811
I have.

53:31.107 --> 53:35.442
I also knew someone who was
haunted by demons, voices.

53:36.779 --> 53:39.647
And did the time ever come
when you had to protect them?

53:40.199 --> 53:41.610
It did.

53:43.536 --> 53:45.277
What did you do?

53:46.497 --> 53:48.363
I died.

54:13.733 --> 54:15.019
Henry!

54:15.109 --> 54:17.066
Ohhh!

54:21.115 --> 54:21.775
Henry!

54:22.784 --> 54:23.570
Henry!

54:23.659 --> 54:25.195
Ohhh!

54:38.758 --> 54:39.714
Henry!

54:39.801 --> 54:42.259
Henry! It's me!

54:44.097 --> 54:45.679
Oh!

55:09.831 --> 55:11.072
No!

55:12.250 --> 55:13.661
Ohhh!

55:19.715 --> 55:21.832
Henry! Henry!

55:23.469 --> 55:25.051
Stop it! Stop!

55:26.180 --> 55:27.296
Stop Henry, stop!

55:27.390 --> 55:28.551
Who are you?

55:28.641 --> 55:30.177
Die!

55:40.862 --> 55:42.273
M-Mother?

55:44.574 --> 55:45.985
Oh Henry!

55:55.668 --> 55:57.375
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sarah.

55:57.462 --> 55:58.873
I've let you down and
I've let Henry down.

55:58.963 --> 56:00.454
No, no.

56:01.466 --> 56:04.083
This spirit has a power
we've not seen before.

56:04.469 --> 56:05.880
Oh my god!

56:05.970 --> 56:08.633
It can take over a mind.

56:11.350 --> 56:13.512
John, send everyone home.

56:13.603 --> 56:15.595
Only we in this
room must remain.

56:15.688 --> 56:16.895
Yes, Ma'am.

56:16.981 --> 56:19.348
This child must be taken
to a hospital immediately.

56:19.442 --> 56:20.933
No, no.
We must watch over him...

56:21.027 --> 56:22.268
To a hospital immediately.

56:22.361 --> 56:24.398
No. No-one else will
understand. He must stay here.

56:24.489 --> 56:25.730
- This is insanity.
- We will watch over him.

56:25.823 --> 56:27.189
Dr Price may be right.

56:28.784 --> 56:30.946
No. No.
We will protect him.

56:31.037 --> 56:32.699
We will protect
him at all costs.

56:32.788 --> 56:33.619
John, come with me.

56:33.706 --> 56:34.617
Aunt Sarah!

56:35.541 --> 56:36.907
Oohh!

56:37.001 --> 56:39.618
Ma'am, I insist that you
receive medical treatment.

56:39.712 --> 56:40.998
Seal that door.

56:41.088 --> 56:42.750
Thirteen nails.

56:42.840 --> 56:43.956
Now.

56:44.550 --> 56:45.631
Now!

56:46.844 --> 56:48.255
Yes, Ma'am.

56:52.892 --> 56:55.009
You leave my family alone.

56:57.146 --> 56:58.978
You speak with me.

57:06.781 --> 57:08.192
Let's just think this through.

57:08.282 --> 57:10.365
Please, Mrs Marriott,
be rational.

57:10.451 --> 57:13.068
Henry clearly has a
trauma and needs help.

57:13.162 --> 57:14.653
Your aunt is caught
in a superstition.

57:14.747 --> 57:16.864
We need-

58:04.088 --> 58:05.829
Thirteen hooks.

58:05.923 --> 58:07.539
You must listen to me.

58:07.633 --> 58:09.499
Is the rifle room finished?

58:09.594 --> 58:10.880
Yes, Ma'am.

58:10.970 --> 58:13.212
My god!
This presence is so strong.

58:13.306 --> 58:15.093
Oh, I feel its hatred...

58:15.182 --> 58:16.514
Oh, enough with the games!

58:16.601 --> 58:18.308
We're taking this
boy to a hospital.

58:18.394 --> 58:19.259
We should listen to him.

58:19.353 --> 58:21.185
Yes! The boy tried to kill you!

58:21.272 --> 58:24.731
No! The shadows will follow us.
Wherever we go.

58:24.817 --> 58:28.151
No, Henry will not
suffer the same fate...

58:28.237 --> 58:30.194
Henry's condition cannot
be cured by witchcraft.

58:30.281 --> 58:31.442
The boy needs a doctor.

58:31.532 --> 58:33.899
Conditions can be cured, doctor.

58:33.993 --> 58:35.825
Curses cannot.

58:35.911 --> 58:37.072
Mrs Marriott,
will you listen to me?

58:37.163 --> 58:38.028
Marion!

58:38.122 --> 58:39.203
I'm, I'm, I'm going
with Dr Price!

58:39.290 --> 58:40.451
No! Henry must stay!

58:40.541 --> 58:41.702
I'll make the arrangements.

58:41.792 --> 58:43.158
Gentlemen, you'll excuse me.

58:43.252 --> 58:45.369
No! No! Marion,
please! Henry must stay.

58:45.463 --> 58:46.499
He must stay with us.

58:46.589 --> 58:48.251
Aunt Sarah, I must
think of Henry.

58:48.341 --> 58:49.923
I should go with him.

58:50.009 --> 58:51.591
I will prove it to you.

58:53.638 --> 58:55.595
Yes, I, I will.

58:56.265 --> 58:57.551
This way.

59:14.367 --> 59:15.403
Operator.

59:18.329 --> 59:19.911
Winchester
Repeating Arms Company.

59:19.997 --> 59:20.987
This is Arthur Gates.

59:21.082 --> 59:24.075
Mr Gates, it's
Dr Eric Price here.

59:25.044 --> 59:27.536
Oh, I trust the assessment
is going well, doctor.

59:27.630 --> 59:29.872
I understand you
received our letter.

59:29.965 --> 59:32.173
It's fine, Mr Gates.
But I require immediate

59:32.259 --> 59:34.717
transportation
to the nearest hospital.

59:34.804 --> 59:36.045
Is everything alright?

59:36.138 --> 59:37.174
Everything is fine.

59:37.264 --> 59:38.755
Just please, a driver,
as soon as possible.

59:38.849 --> 59:40.886
Of course, right away.
- Thank you.

59:40.976 --> 59:43.184
And ah the assessment, doctor?

59:43.270 --> 59:45.057
You'll get what you wanted.

59:46.232 --> 59:47.643
Christ!

59:51.779 --> 59:54.021
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be rude.

59:54.115 --> 59:57.825
Sir, we're all deeply concerned
for Master Henry's wellbeing.

59:57.910 --> 01:00:00.197
If there is anything
I can do to assist you, I...

01:00:01.247 --> 01:00:03.739
Well, actually you can.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.699
I need to get my bags, please?

01:00:05.793 --> 01:00:06.954
Of course.

01:00:07.044 --> 01:00:09.787
- Thank you.
- Happy to help.

01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:11.872
Hmmm.

01:00:14.343 --> 01:00:17.461
Mrs Winchester is
truly a remarkable woman.

01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:20.844
She knows what she's doing.
She has created a vessel

01:00:20.933 --> 01:00:22.970
for the deceased to
communicate with her.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.847
She's certainly created some
architectural oddities.

01:00:24.937 --> 01:00:28.055
This house, I've seen things.

01:00:30.484 --> 01:00:32.567
I know this room.

01:00:33.362 --> 01:00:34.318
Things?

01:00:35.531 --> 01:00:36.863
The dead.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.486
Criminals.

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:42.452
Lost souls who
met a violent end.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.118
You've seen them, haven't you?

01:00:56.343 --> 01:00:59.507
Dr Price, many staff have
reported hearing noises.

01:00:59.597 --> 01:01:02.465
They come from inside rooms
that have been nailed shut.

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:05.926
Strange occurrences in those
rooms; that is why the doors

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.103
have been sealed, to
keep the unruly in.

01:01:08.189 --> 01:01:10.897
But the staff have
only heard noises.

01:01:10.983 --> 01:01:15.193
To see them, well, I believe
you and I are unique.

01:01:16.197 --> 01:01:17.404
Really?

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:20.573
Yes, perhaps it's all just a
symptom of Mrs Winchester's

01:01:20.659 --> 01:01:22.241
persuasive influence.

01:01:22.328 --> 01:01:26.038
Sir, locking Mrs Marriott
and her child away is only

01:01:26.123 --> 01:01:27.580
delaying the inevitable.

01:01:28.542 --> 01:01:29.623
And what is the inevitable?

01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:32.453
They're all Winchester.
They will all-

01:01:32.546 --> 01:01:34.037
die.

01:02:00.991 --> 01:02:01.947
Mr Hansen!

01:02:02.034 --> 01:02:03.070
Is she in there?

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.571
Yes, doctor.

01:02:04.662 --> 01:02:07.029
Good. You need to hear this.
Mrs Winchester, there is a man

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:09.865
in your employ who has
clearly lost his mind. He just...

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.917
That's him!

01:02:13.003 --> 01:02:14.210
You saw him?

01:02:14.296 --> 01:02:15.503
You spoke with him?

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:16.830
Well, yes, I spoke
with him just now.

01:02:16.924 --> 01:02:18.040
The man threatened you.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:19.920
Read it.
Read the paper.

01:02:23.013 --> 01:02:26.222
'Corporal Benjamin Joseph Block
was killed during a siege at

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:28.265
the Winchester Repeating
Arms general office.'

01:02:28.352 --> 01:02:29.217
That's impossible.

01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.678
This newspaper
is 20 years old.

01:02:34.024 --> 01:02:37.813
Cruelty, grief and loss can make
people do unimaginable things.

01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:44.866
Ben lost two brothers
on the battlefield.

01:02:44.952 --> 01:02:47.365
The youngest was
only 14 years old.

01:02:48.539 --> 01:02:51.031
Their confederate muskets were
no match for the Winchester

01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:53.492
rifles of the Union Army.

01:02:54.086 --> 01:02:55.748
They were cut down.

01:03:02.303 --> 01:03:03.794
Ben swore revenge.

01:03:05.431 --> 01:03:07.593
To him, the people who created
the weapon that killed his

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:11.427
brothers were as guilty as
those who pulled the trigger.

01:03:21.572 --> 01:03:24.565
He killed fifteen
innocent people that day.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:27.947
He locked himself
in the display room.

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:30.199
We used to call it
the show-off room.

01:03:31.999 --> 01:03:34.707
We know you're in there.
We have the building surrounded.

01:03:47.681 --> 01:03:49.468
Officer John
Mandel told the press

01:03:49.558 --> 01:03:52.141
'I'm extremely proud of my
team, and that scum like Block

01:03:52.227 --> 01:03:54.139
can't escape my men
and their Winchesters'.

01:03:54.229 --> 01:03:55.436
Weapons ready!

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:16.832
This way.

01:04:16.919 --> 01:04:18.660
When the bell
chimes at midnight,

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.962
he'll be at his most powerful.

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:25.459
Do you know who the most
terrifying monster is, doctor?

01:04:26.136 --> 01:04:27.172
No.

01:04:28.847 --> 01:04:31.305
The one you invite
into your own home.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.561
This is it.

01:04:47.324 --> 01:04:48.906
This is the room.

01:05:08.012 --> 01:05:11.346
This is an exact replica of
the room he was killed in.

01:05:11.849 --> 01:05:13.260
Yes.

01:05:13.350 --> 01:05:16.718
And now that it is complete,
he is in this world.

01:05:17.646 --> 01:05:19.888
Do you see anyone, doctor?

01:05:21.108 --> 01:05:22.269
It's impossible.

01:05:22.359 --> 01:05:24.646
Doctor, you must believe.

01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:26.941
It's illogical.

01:05:37.291 --> 01:05:39.999
Corporal Block, please,

01:05:42.254 --> 01:05:45.338
please feel my deep remorse

01:05:45.424 --> 01:05:47.791
for the death
of your brothers,

01:05:48.427 --> 01:05:51.966
of James and young Harry

01:05:52.056 --> 01:05:54.139
by the Winchester rifle.

01:05:54.224 --> 01:05:58.264
I know all three of you
feel pain and torment.

01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:01.646
But violence cannot
bring justice.

01:06:02.941 --> 01:06:06.059
Only more suffering,
and I will not allow my family

01:06:06.153 --> 01:06:08.145
to suffer any more.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.527
Leave this house
with your brothers.

01:06:13.577 --> 01:06:16.160
I hope together
you can find peace.

01:06:25.923 --> 01:06:29.587
Beautiful dreamer,
wake unto me;

01:07:12.928 --> 01:07:14.294
It's Ben.

01:08:07.399 --> 01:08:08.435
Stop them!

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.605
No!

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:47.220
Mrs Winchester?

01:08:52.277 --> 01:08:54.609
Oh! I'll find
another way to get to you!

01:09:06.124 --> 01:09:08.411
Henry,
sweetheart, where are you?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:12.536
Henry?

01:09:12.923 --> 01:09:14.004
Henry?

01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:23.218
Henry!

01:09:25.185 --> 01:09:26.801
Henry! Henry!

01:09:38.282 --> 01:09:40.865
Eric, this is just in your mind.
Fear is just in your mind.

01:09:40.951 --> 01:09:42.863
It is only in your mind.

01:10:26.163 --> 01:10:27.529
Henry?

01:10:35.505 --> 01:10:37.041
Henry, where are you?

01:10:44.264 --> 01:10:45.755
Henry, sweetheart?

01:10:46.224 --> 01:10:48.056
Where are you?

01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.999
Be free, my brothers.

01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:06.089
I always loved our
garden room, sweetheart.

01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:08.429
Ruby!

01:12:08.515 --> 01:12:10.723
But you let it die!

01:12:10.809 --> 01:12:11.720
Oh no.

01:12:12.978 --> 01:12:16.562
Tell me the story about the
farmer, who owned the old mule.

01:12:16.648 --> 01:12:17.513
No.

01:12:17.607 --> 01:12:19.940
I always liked that story.

01:12:20.485 --> 01:12:22.602
They built our garden room.

01:12:23.697 --> 01:12:26.861
The farmer's old mule
fell into his well.

01:12:28.452 --> 01:12:29.818
Go on, Eric.

01:12:31.621 --> 01:12:33.032
The farmer heard...

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.367
He heard the mule crying.

01:12:38.670 --> 01:12:40.252
And it broke his heart.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:44.298
He chose to bury the animal in
the well and put it out of its...

01:12:44.384 --> 01:12:45.670
its hardship.

01:12:46.428 --> 01:12:48.511
He started shoveling.

01:12:49.848 --> 01:12:53.842
The mule realized that every
time dirt fell on his back, he

01:12:53.935 --> 01:12:57.019
could shake it off and step up.

01:12:57.647 --> 01:12:58.808
Shovel after shovel.

01:12:58.899 --> 01:13:01.107
He could shake it off
and he could step up...

01:13:01.193 --> 01:13:02.650
Shake it off.

01:13:02.736 --> 01:13:07.276
It wasn't long before the old
mule, battered and exhausted,

01:13:07.365 --> 01:13:10.199
stepped over the
wall of that well.

01:13:11.161 --> 01:13:12.902
What should have buried him...

01:13:14.122 --> 01:13:15.533
Saved him.

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.035
And he overcame...

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.616
This is not real.

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:20.372
This is not happening.
You are not real.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.203
I've tried to be a good wife.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:24.334
The voices are not real, Ruby.

01:13:24.424 --> 01:13:26.791
They were never real.
They were just inside your head.

01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:29.753
All these years, all I wanted
was for you to believe me but...

01:13:29.846 --> 01:13:32.259
- I should have put you in care.
- You never did.

01:13:32.349 --> 01:13:33.590
I should have put you in care.

01:13:33.683 --> 01:13:36.266
Just something that can
be diagnosed and treated,

01:13:36.353 --> 01:13:38.060
like any other crazy person.

01:13:38.146 --> 01:13:40.354
Yes. I did.
I made a mistake.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.305
I'm sorry.

01:13:41.399 --> 01:13:44.517
A delusional disorder.
- Yes.

01:13:44.611 --> 01:13:46.227
That's what you called it.
- Yes.

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.938
Put the gun down, Ruby, please.
We can talk about this.

01:13:49.032 --> 01:13:51.149
I don't want to talk anymore.

01:13:51.243 --> 01:13:53.530
I need you to believe me.

01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:55.907
I don't know what
I believe anymore.

01:13:57.249 --> 01:13:59.366
Someone like you never will.

01:13:59.834 --> 01:14:01.120
Please, Ruby, don't.

01:14:01.211 --> 01:14:03.168
Please, I'm lost
without you, Ruby.

01:14:03.255 --> 01:14:05.372
I'm lost without you.

01:14:05.465 --> 01:14:07.206
Don't do it. No!

01:14:36.788 --> 01:14:38.324
You can go on.

01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:42.079
You need to let
go of your guilt,

01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:46.329
so that I can let go of mine,

01:14:47.299 --> 01:14:49.712
and see the truth.

01:14:55.098 --> 01:14:56.930
I'm so sorry.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.590
Mrs Winchester, are you alright?

01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:58.886
This spirit is destroying
the balance of this house.

01:17:01.224 --> 01:17:03.216
It has to be stopped.

01:17:09.399 --> 01:17:11.982
Master Henry and Marion,
we need to find them.

01:17:12.986 --> 01:17:14.568
Seal that door.

01:17:15.989 --> 01:17:18.106
Ben must not leave.

01:17:24.581 --> 01:17:25.867
Henry?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.161
Thirteen.

01:18:10.794 --> 01:18:11.830
Sit.

01:18:16.257 --> 01:18:17.998
Sarah, I can see them.

01:18:18.092 --> 01:18:20.175
I can see all of them.

01:18:20.261 --> 01:18:22.218
You're the only one who can.

01:18:23.306 --> 01:18:24.592
You believe?

01:18:24.682 --> 01:18:25.763
I do.

01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:27.717
I do.

01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:32.101
Dead for three minutes, killed
by the Winchester rifle.

01:18:33.066 --> 01:18:35.228
You are connected to this house.

01:18:36.653 --> 01:18:37.894
Yes.

01:18:45.495 --> 01:18:46.611
Henry!

01:18:48.998 --> 01:18:50.205
I'm not afraid.

01:18:56.589 --> 01:18:58.421
I'm not afraid.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:03.628
I, I won't let fear control me.

01:19:13.523 --> 01:19:14.513
Henry!

01:19:16.025 --> 01:19:17.357
Henry!

01:19:20.905 --> 01:19:23.113
Oh please, please
come back to me!

01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:34.542
Marion and Henry
are in grave danger.

01:19:34.627 --> 01:19:39.088
The only way to save them
is to stop Ben here and now.

01:19:41.968 --> 01:19:44.381
Ben, leave my family alone.

01:19:47.765 --> 01:19:49.597
You speak to me.

01:19:51.561 --> 01:19:53.177
Talk to me...

01:19:56.232 --> 01:19:57.473
now.

01:20:07.577 --> 01:20:08.658
Sarah!

01:20:10.413 --> 01:20:12.700
Corporal Block is in this room.

01:20:18.046 --> 01:20:20.333
Winchesters are a vile plague!

01:20:20.423 --> 01:20:22.585
This whore bitch has to die!

01:20:22.675 --> 01:20:23.586
Sarah, fight him!

01:20:24.552 --> 01:20:27.044
My brothers were killed by
the rifle, murdered by this

01:20:27.138 --> 01:20:28.845
instrument of death...

01:20:28.932 --> 01:20:29.547
Fight him!

01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:31.507
...that killed your wife.

01:20:36.606 --> 01:20:38.268
Sarah, control this!
Control it!

01:20:39.359 --> 01:20:40.816
Be present, Sarah!
Be present.

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:42.188
I want you to suffer.

01:20:43.196 --> 01:20:44.403
Marion is mine.

01:20:44.489 --> 01:20:46.071
Henry is mine!

01:20:46.157 --> 01:20:48.399
- Sarah, no! Fight it!
- An eye for an eye!

01:20:48.493 --> 01:20:49.904
Get off me!

01:20:49.994 --> 01:20:52.577
These vermin profit from death.

01:20:52.664 --> 01:20:53.575
Sarah, fight him!

01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:54.826
No more!

01:21:00.797 --> 01:21:03.540
Oh! Seal the floor, doctor.

01:21:03.633 --> 01:21:05.670
Thirteen nails. Hurry!

01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:09.336
His rage is endless.

01:21:10.848 --> 01:21:12.089
But he can be stopped.

01:21:12.183 --> 01:21:13.094
How?

01:21:13.184 --> 01:21:16.302
By something,
something in this room.

01:21:16.896 --> 01:21:18.478
He's afraid of something.

01:21:18.564 --> 01:21:19.850
I felt it.

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.018
His gun!

01:21:25.738 --> 01:21:26.819
That's twelve!

01:21:28.074 --> 01:21:29.190
This is the gun...

01:21:33.037 --> 01:21:34.699
he used to kill.

01:21:40.336 --> 01:21:41.622
Do you see him?

01:21:41.713 --> 01:21:42.544
No.

01:21:44.048 --> 01:21:45.880
There. Done!

01:21:45.967 --> 01:21:47.299
Now he's locked in.

01:21:47.385 --> 01:21:49.251
And so are we.

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.389
Ben, show yourself.

01:22:03.776 --> 01:22:05.483
Show yourself!

01:22:39.896 --> 01:22:43.230
Your anger will never defeat us.

01:23:04.253 --> 01:23:06.461
You took
everything from me!

01:23:06.547 --> 01:23:07.788
Ahhh!

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.221
They're going
right through him!

01:23:16.307 --> 01:23:17.593
You saw him?

01:23:17.683 --> 01:23:18.514
Yes!

01:23:32.615 --> 01:23:33.651
Who's there?

01:23:35.284 --> 01:23:36.650
You're there.

01:23:36.744 --> 01:23:39.157
You are there amongst the dead.

01:23:40.289 --> 01:23:41.655
It's not the gun.

01:23:41.749 --> 01:23:44.366
He's afraid of something else.

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.632
You kept it and refurbished it.

01:23:56.139 --> 01:23:58.051
All because it's a
reminder of my past.

01:23:58.141 --> 01:24:00.929
Instruments of death
have a powerful connection

01:24:01.018 --> 01:24:02.634
to the afterlife.

01:24:03.855 --> 01:24:07.064
What should have
killed him, saved him.

01:24:17.785 --> 01:24:21.028
Ben, we can help you be
free of your torment.

01:24:27.879 --> 01:24:29.211
I'm a mother...

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.377
a fighter.

01:24:40.099 --> 01:24:41.340
Show yourself.

01:24:44.187 --> 01:24:45.428
A protector.

01:24:47.481 --> 01:24:49.768
And I am not afraid.

01:25:45.331 --> 01:25:46.913
See the truth.

01:26:11.816 --> 01:26:12.977
Yes!

01:26:21.617 --> 01:26:22.949
He's at peace.

01:26:24.453 --> 01:26:26.194
He has joined his brothers.

01:26:26.789 --> 01:26:28.530
You've done it.

01:26:28.624 --> 01:26:29.740
They're gone.

01:26:34.755 --> 01:26:37.793
Everybody else,
go back to your rooms-

01:26:40.594 --> 01:26:42.051
all of you.

01:27:07.621 --> 01:27:09.078
Oh! Henry!

01:27:10.583 --> 01:27:11.243
Henry!

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.455
Henry!
Oh, Henry!

01:27:19.925 --> 01:27:23.919
Dear Mr Gates, below you will
find my psychological assessment

01:27:24.013 --> 01:27:28.098
and mental status examination of
Mrs Sarah Lockwood Winchester.

01:27:29.518 --> 01:27:31.976
It was conducted at her home
between the dates of April 12 to

01:27:32.063 --> 01:27:36.854
April 19, 1906, and prepared at
the request of the Winchester

01:27:36.942 --> 01:27:40.982
Repeating Arms Company.
In my professional opinion,

01:27:41.072 --> 01:27:44.190
after having observed Mrs
Winchester for the past week,

01:27:44.283 --> 01:27:48.653
it is my conclusion that she is
of sound mind and body, and is

01:27:48.746 --> 01:27:51.705
fit to continue in her role with
the Winchester Repeating Arms

01:27:51.791 --> 01:27:55.535
Company, for as long as
she desires such a burden.

01:28:00.633 --> 01:28:03.546
Yours truly, Dr Eric A Price.

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:23.311
It's time for us both
to leave this house.

01:28:26.575 --> 01:28:28.032
I'll always miss you.

01:28:44.135 --> 01:28:46.798
Thank you, Dr Price,
for your help.

01:28:47.763 --> 01:28:48.719
Young man.

01:28:52.601 --> 01:28:53.887
Thank you.

01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:09.403
Time for me to say goodbye.

01:29:18.544 --> 01:29:20.206
Ruby loves you.

01:29:21.672 --> 01:29:23.880
That did not stop
after her death.

01:29:24.633 --> 01:29:26.670
You know that, don't you?

01:29:27.761 --> 01:29:29.218
I do.

01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:37.389
You know, in spite of
everything, you really-

01:29:38.522 --> 01:29:40.514
do have a beautiful home.

01:29:40.941 --> 01:29:42.773
What are you going to next?

01:29:44.111 --> 01:29:46.068
Rebuild, of course.

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.614
Of course.
