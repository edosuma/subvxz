WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:03.068
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.540 --> 00:07.041
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.810
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.934 --> 00:12.330
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.453 --> 00:14.746
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.914 --> 00:16.128
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.226 --> 00:18.765
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.374 --> 00:20.708
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:21.650 --> 00:24.152
A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend --

00:24.220 --> 00:25.554
Should we shoot them?

00:25.623 --> 00:27.261
-- An old friend who used to

00:27.330 --> 00:28.965
inform on you to the FBI --

00:29.034 --> 00:30.133
You know spies --

00:30.201 --> 00:31.233
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:31.302 --> 00:31.834
-- Family, too --

00:31.903 --> 00:32.969
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.037 --> 00:33.805
-- If you're desperate.

00:33.874 --> 00:35.542
Someone needs your
help, Michael.

00:35.611 --> 00:36.643
Bottom line --

00:36.712 --> 00:38.081
as long as you're burned, you're

00:38.149 --> 00:40.292
not going anywhere.

00:43.557 --> 00:44.957
As a field operative, some

00:45.025 --> 00:46.623
aspects of life aren't part of

00:46.692 --> 00:48.866
your daily experience.

00:48.901 --> 00:49.983
You may be familiar with the

00:49.984 --> 00:51.634
mountains of Afghanistan or know

00:51.635 --> 00:52.908
how to break down a .50-caliber

00:52.909 --> 00:55.466
machine gun, but that expertise

00:55.467 --> 00:56.800
comes at the cost of certain

00:56.869 --> 00:59.517
normal activities people
take for granted.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.093
Keeping up with sports teams,

01:01.094 --> 01:03.502
for example, or the details of
lawn care --

01:04.885 --> 01:06.083
-- Or dealing with babies.

01:08.606 --> 01:10.903
You're sure it doesn't need
medical attention?

01:11.215 --> 01:12.652
Its name is Charlie.

01:12.653 --> 01:13.944
And your nephew's fine, bro.

01:13.945 --> 01:15.187
He just needs a little nap.

01:15.428 --> 01:17.148
Oh, by the way, mom --
thank you so much for the

01:17.163 --> 01:18.229
"welcome home" meat loaf.

01:18.298 --> 01:20.563
It was really -- it was
thoroughly cooked.

01:20.632 --> 01:23.705
And, uh, Ruth's going to be
bummed she missed it.

01:24.800 --> 01:26.878
Well, it's not every day you
can get a pedicure.

01:28.624 --> 01:29.423
So, how's Fiona?

01:29.492 --> 01:32.511
Mom told me you guys
are living together?

01:32.836 --> 01:34.169
Yes, we are.

01:34.237 --> 01:35.704
It's moving fast.

01:35.705 --> 01:38.271
At this rate, they
should be married by 60.

01:39.144 --> 01:39.943
Thanks for the food, mom.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.311
I'm going to go fix the Charger.

01:43.322 --> 01:44.941
Michael, is there going to be
an end to this?

01:45.150 --> 01:46.439
'Cause I want my garage back.

01:47.648 --> 01:50.885
Mom?

01:50.886 --> 01:52.869
Could you just support his head?

01:53.572 --> 01:54.204
You know, I mean, his little

01:54.273 --> 01:56.507
neck muscles are not
really developed yet.

01:57.543 --> 01:59.930
You may recall that I've done
this a couple of times.

02:01.673 --> 02:02.974
Anything else?

02:03.284 --> 02:05.194
No.
That's it.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.566
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

02:13.635 --> 02:17.269
This would be an awesome
project for us.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.237
We could finally convert your

02:19.306 --> 02:21.807
ride into a spymobile.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.508
We'd put a smoke-screen button

02:23.577 --> 02:25.510
right here for
high-speed pursuits.

02:25.578 --> 02:26.344
You know what happens to

02:26.413 --> 02:27.211
smoke at 60 miles an hour?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.946
It dissipates.

02:29.015 --> 02:30.348
You doing all right, bro?

02:30.417 --> 02:32.699
Nate, why'd you
move back to Miami?

02:33.854 --> 02:34.619
See?

02:35.522 --> 02:36.799
Why do you got to be like that?

02:36.800 --> 02:38.328
It's important to me and Ruth

02:38.329 --> 02:39.763
that Charlie grow
up around family.

02:40.055 --> 02:41.995
The same Ruth who skipped the

02:41.996 --> 02:44.161
"welcome home" lunch
for a pedicure?

02:47.502 --> 02:48.568
Look, you know Vegas isn't

02:48.637 --> 02:50.871
the right kind of place for me.

02:50.939 --> 02:52.305
And since Charlie's been born,

02:52.374 --> 02:54.103
I've been trying to
keep my nose clean.

02:54.268 --> 02:56.436
I've been going back
to Gamblers Anonymous.

02:56.672 --> 02:57.615
Good for you.

02:57.879 --> 02:58.948
Yeah.

02:59.482 --> 03:00.622
It is good for me.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.777
But I-I was kind of hoping that

03:02.778 --> 03:05.414
you and mom could help me stay

03:05.415 --> 03:09.617
straight, 'cause, um,
family helps, bro.

03:10.260 --> 03:12.912
You can help with the Charger.

03:14.713 --> 03:15.712
Thanks.

03:15.915 --> 03:16.714
It's good to have you home.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.332
I should run.

03:19.401 --> 03:20.433
Yeah?

03:20.502 --> 03:22.108
Super-secret spy meeting?

03:22.226 --> 03:23.350
Super-secret.

03:24.073 --> 03:25.858
Oh.

03:32.878 --> 03:33.943
Fi, uh, I thought we were

03:34.012 --> 03:35.945
shopping for drapes.

03:36.014 --> 03:36.546
That store sells drapes.

03:36.615 --> 03:37.914
First things first.

03:37.983 --> 03:39.049
I'm buying you a paper shredder.

03:39.589 --> 03:40.394
Paper shredder?

03:40.494 --> 03:41.991
You seem preoccupied lately.

03:42.220 --> 03:42.852
I don't think it's healthy to

03:42.920 --> 03:44.599
keep files on the people who
ruined your life.

03:44.938 --> 03:47.727
Vaughn, Carla, management --

03:47.728 --> 03:49.888
they don't deserve a place in
your head or your file cabinet.

03:50.174 --> 03:52.474
I don't think some old files
are the problem, Fi.

03:52.690 --> 03:54.389
Well, let's get rid of them and see.

03:54.697 --> 03:56.363
That part of your life is over.

03:58.908 --> 03:59.925
Michael?

03:59.926 --> 04:01.606
I think we're being tailed.

04:01.607 --> 04:02.973
Man with the blue shopping bag.

04:03.830 --> 04:05.276
You sure?

04:05.277 --> 04:06.376
Not yet.

04:07.428 --> 04:08.494
I clocked him in the parking lot

04:08.563 --> 04:10.186
and the coffee place.

04:10.455 --> 04:11.888
I don't think it's
anything, Michael.

04:11.956 --> 04:13.737
- Let's split up and see.
- Fine.

04:15.319 --> 04:18.422
One of the toughest parts of
adjusting to civilian life after

04:18.423 --> 04:20.755
a major operation
is the paranoia.

04:20.825 --> 04:21.624
You can't turn it off.

04:21.692 --> 04:25.934
If a shopper behind you is
carrying a suspicious package

04:25.935 --> 04:28.435
and avoiding eye contact, they

04:28.504 --> 04:29.569
could be there to do you harm.

04:29.638 --> 04:30.971
And if you're right about the

04:31.040 --> 04:34.019
threat, the consequences
could be serious.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.380
What do you want?
What do you want?!

04:37.521 --> 04:38.851
Daddy?

04:38.852 --> 04:40.602
Of course, if you're wrong,

04:40.603 --> 04:42.803
the consequences could
be serious, as well.

04:42.804 --> 04:44.183
Michael!

04:44.184 --> 04:44.683
I'm sorry.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.851
I thought I --
What are you doing?

04:46.404 --> 04:48.037
I thought that -- I-I'm sorry.
My -- my boyfriend is --

04:48.173 --> 04:51.001
Your boyfriend is
a psycho, lady.

04:51.210 --> 04:53.172
Come on, honey.

04:59.069 --> 05:02.655
Post-operation paranoia isn't
something you can control.

05:02.888 --> 05:03.953
It's with you always --

05:04.443 --> 05:06.377
when you're working,
when you're relaxing.

05:06.445 --> 05:09.603
Even sleep is no escape.

05:17.693 --> 05:18.971
There's nothing there.

05:21.185 --> 05:22.223
You're dreaming again.

05:23.899 --> 05:25.443
We took care of it.

05:27.073 --> 05:28.691
Okay?

05:33.169 --> 05:36.169
<font color=#00FF00>Burn Notice 5x03</font>

Original Air Date on July 7, 2011

05:36.170 --> 05:39.170
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

05:45.951 --> 05:47.852
Hey, Mikey,
how you doing?

05:48.487 --> 05:49.554
Got you a gift.

05:49.556 --> 05:51.222
You got me a gift?
Yeah.

05:51.224 --> 05:53.291
Let me tell you -- you're
a tough guy to shop for.

05:53.293 --> 05:56.026
I mean, what do you get
for the guy who basically has nothing.

05:56.342 --> 05:57.484
Anyway, try that.

06:00.314 --> 06:01.913
A gift certificate
for a massage.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.550
Best spa in Miami --

06:04.033 --> 06:05.486
The Mist at the Darabont Hotel.

06:05.487 --> 06:06.910
There's a five-month
waiting list,

06:06.911 --> 06:09.018
unless you have
an in with the owner.

06:09.543 --> 06:11.013
Sam's new girlfriend.

06:11.014 --> 06:12.244
You have a new girlfriend?

06:12.245 --> 06:14.030
Elsa and I don't
use labels, Mike.

06:14.251 --> 06:16.185
Except boy toy.

06:16.253 --> 06:17.741
Ha!
She calls me "boy toy."

06:18.022 --> 06:19.131
Ha ha.

06:19.132 --> 06:20.471
Anyway, this spa is so

06:20.472 --> 06:21.505
relaxing, they got to bring in a

06:21.574 --> 06:23.912
defibrillator to wake you up
when you're done.

06:24.003 --> 06:24.967
Might help you with
your little --

06:27.298 --> 06:28.703
You told him, Fi?

06:30.114 --> 06:33.078
That you're obsessing over
the people who burned you even

06:33.079 --> 06:35.042
though they're either
dead or in jail?

06:35.043 --> 06:35.843
I might have mentioned it.

06:35.911 --> 06:36.576
We've always known you've been a

06:36.645 --> 06:39.386
little crazy, but we just don't
want you going crazy-crazy.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.624
Sam, I'm fine.
It's just nightmares.

06:41.625 --> 06:42.891
Well, they're a little
more than that.

06:42.959 --> 06:46.053
You attacked a man who was about
to pull a Teddy bear on you.

06:46.054 --> 06:48.388
I told you I spotted
him three times.

06:48.389 --> 06:50.754
I couldn't take the risk.
It was a mistake.

06:50.943 --> 06:54.024
I'm fine.

06:55.521 --> 06:56.836
It's Nate.

06:56.936 --> 06:58.101
He's picking me up at the loft
in 15 minutes.

06:58.104 --> 07:00.100
Okay, Mike, get
yourself a massage.

07:00.101 --> 07:00.868
Do yourself a favor.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.102
Wow.
So, that went well.

07:05.020 --> 07:06.118
Look, let's not
worry about Mike.

07:06.187 --> 07:07.520
He's just Mike.

07:07.589 --> 07:13.659
Not right now, he isn't.

07:14.162 --> 07:16.261
Two weeks living in Miami,

07:16.262 --> 07:17.027
and you're already in trouble.

07:17.997 --> 07:19.362
That's a record even for you.

07:19.431 --> 07:20.938
It's not me.
It's my friend.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.392
Look, bro, I just
need a little backup.

07:23.512 --> 07:24.310
Nate, I'm sorry.

07:24.379 --> 07:26.904
I just can't deal
with this right now.

07:27.704 --> 07:28.503
Okay. Good.

07:28.572 --> 07:29.938
That's what I'll tell my friend.

07:30.007 --> 07:31.639
I'll say, "oh, I am so sorry

07:31.640 --> 07:33.616
that your life is in danger...

07:35.275 --> 07:36.374
"But it's just really not

07:36.443 --> 07:37.776
convenient for my
brother right now."

07:38.616 --> 07:41.859
- Whose life is in danger?
- Jessica.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.079
I knew her husband for like a

07:43.080 --> 07:44.976
million years in
Gamblers Anonymous.

07:44.977 --> 07:46.642
He died of a heart
attack last month.

07:46.643 --> 07:47.744
He left her drowning in debt.

07:47.812 --> 07:49.519
Let me guess --
loan-shark problems.

07:49.690 --> 07:51.192
Yeah.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.595
The dirtbag's name is Carter.

07:53.596 --> 07:56.257
She's in mourning, and the guy
trashed her shop.

07:56.487 --> 07:58.120
She's in fear for her life.

07:58.189 --> 07:59.254
She thinks he's
going to kill her.

07:59.323 --> 08:01.510
- Tell her to call the cops.
- I did.

08:01.511 --> 08:03.144
They filed a report for property

08:03.213 --> 08:04.865
damage, and then they told her,

08:04.866 --> 08:06.184
"call back if it gets serious."

08:07.125 --> 08:08.791
Nate, I don't --

08:09.467 --> 08:11.667
I'm just not up for
this right now.

08:12.595 --> 08:15.686
Listen, bro, I know you're
going through some stuff.

08:16.864 --> 08:20.069
But half of you is better than
all of most people.

08:21.359 --> 08:23.428
Come on.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.373
The day after Paul's funeral,
this guy, Carter, showed up.

08:29.731 --> 08:31.597
He told me that my husband owed
him a ton of money.

08:31.598 --> 08:34.009
I didn't even know that Paul
had been gambling again.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.241
He was in the hole
over 100 grand, Mike.

08:37.278 --> 08:39.183
And now Carter wants to squeeze
the money out of you?

08:39.246 --> 08:41.380
I gave him everything I could,
but it wasn't enough.

08:41.381 --> 08:43.470
Somehow he found out
about my dad's boat.

08:43.777 --> 08:45.285
It's her dad's charter
fishing boat.

08:45.389 --> 08:47.122
And, of course, without that,
he's out of work.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.808
Losing it will destroy him, but
it's the only thing that my

08:49.809 --> 08:51.300
family owns that's
worth anything.

08:51.648 --> 08:52.803
I don't know what else to do.

08:53.137 --> 08:54.777
Giving Carter the boat won't
solve your problem.

08:54.778 --> 08:56.125
He'll just go after
something else.

08:56.126 --> 08:57.997
Which is why we have to draw
a line in the sand.

08:58.290 --> 08:59.533
All right?
We get a bat, right?

08:59.534 --> 09:00.851
Couple bats.

09:00.919 --> 09:03.112
- Um, actually, no.
- And then -- no bats.

09:03.113 --> 09:05.413
Just don't give him
the boat just yet.

09:05.414 --> 09:06.278
I'll see what I can do.

09:06.376 --> 09:07.562
You guys know I'm broke.

09:07.563 --> 09:09.367
I can't afford to pay you
anything,

09:09.951 --> 09:11.748
unless you
accept free yogurt.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.367
Deal.

09:20.159 --> 09:21.467
So, what's our move?

09:21.810 --> 09:23.841
This guy Carter, he
hangs out at Jai Alai.

09:23.842 --> 09:25.836
It's down on 37th.

09:25.837 --> 09:26.649
I was thinking we
could do some --

09:26.650 --> 09:28.723
After you drop me off, your
move is going home.

09:29.744 --> 09:30.743
What?

09:30.858 --> 09:32.475
You have a 2-month-old
baby, Nate.

09:32.476 --> 09:34.079
You shouldn't be hanging out
around loan sharks.

09:34.446 --> 09:35.898
Sam and I will check
this guy out.

09:37.000 --> 09:43.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

09:45.375 --> 09:49.307
Gaming facilities provide a
natural habitat for loan sharks

09:49.308 --> 09:50.674
who are always hunting for

09:50.743 --> 09:53.146
gamblers who need a quick buck
at a bad rate.

09:53.414 --> 09:54.179
As long as they don't turn on

09:54.248 --> 09:55.614
each other, they're at the top

09:55.683 --> 09:57.749
of the food chain.

10:02.790 --> 10:04.166
Mike, I thought we just

10:04.167 --> 10:05.714
talked about you
taking some time off.

10:05.724 --> 10:06.523
We did.

10:06.592 --> 10:08.916
But I couldn't very well tell
Nate's friend, "sorry your

10:08.917 --> 10:11.316
life's in danger, but it's not
convenient for me right now."

10:11.677 --> 10:13.654
Well, this is basically the
opposite of a vacation.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.053
I mean, Nate's friend isn't just

10:15.122 --> 10:16.754
dealing with a
street hustler here.

10:16.823 --> 10:18.756
Take a look at the guy.

10:18.825 --> 10:20.157
Guy looks like he's made out of

10:20.226 --> 10:22.159
scrap metal -- that's Carter.

10:22.228 --> 10:23.294
He's got a rep for squeezing

10:23.362 --> 10:24.728
people until they're
selling plasma.

10:24.797 --> 10:26.867
He's moving up the
ranks pretty quick.

10:26.868 --> 10:28.158
The guy's a real pit bull.

10:31.152 --> 10:32.618
The one holding his leash?

10:32.619 --> 10:33.969
Uh, that's the boss, Wallace.

10:33.970 --> 10:35.930
He owns this place
and Jessica's debt.

10:35.931 --> 10:37.442
Suspected in a
couple of murders.

10:40.168 --> 10:40.733
I checked into him, Mike.

10:40.802 --> 10:42.135
These guys are real pros.

10:42.204 --> 10:44.206
Good.
You'll be careful.

10:44.740 --> 10:46.073
You got something in mind?

10:46.142 --> 10:47.838
Convince him the boat they

10:47.839 --> 10:50.186
want is mixed up in a
police investigation.

10:50.395 --> 10:51.161
If they're as smart as you say

10:51.230 --> 10:52.596
you are, they'll back off and

10:52.664 --> 10:53.725
leave Jessica alone.

10:53.726 --> 10:54.492
Nice.

10:54.561 --> 10:56.227
So you want to swap the
papers on the boat.

10:56.295 --> 10:56.927
You think one of your cop

10:56.996 --> 10:58.183
buddies can hook us up with a

10:58.184 --> 11:00.614
fishing boat the Miami P.D.'s
already investigating?

11:00.900 --> 11:02.741
Mike, what are the chances
you're going to forget all this

11:02.798 --> 11:04.345
and use that spa
gift certificate?

11:04.346 --> 11:06.288
- Zero.
- I'm on it.

11:08.382 --> 11:10.015
Come on, Vega!
Quit dogging it!

11:24.083 --> 11:26.549
Hoping to scare off that loan
shark with your shirt?

11:27.257 --> 11:29.805
It's part of the Nate
Westen collection.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.247
It won't get into my
regular rotation.

11:32.248 --> 11:33.257
I promise.

11:33.258 --> 11:34.374
I should hope not.

11:35.516 --> 11:37.183
Are you sure you
want to do this?

11:37.252 --> 11:37.884
A woman's in real trouble.

11:37.952 --> 11:40.513
It's better than me
obsessing over...

11:41.017 --> 11:42.674
The other thing.

11:43.479 --> 11:44.945
Well, I'm glad we're
on the same page.

11:45.014 --> 11:46.621
I picked up that paper shredder

11:46.622 --> 11:48.082
we didn't get a chance to buy
the other day.

11:51.248 --> 11:54.966
One press of the button, and
your past becomes your past.

11:57.840 --> 11:59.850
All right.
I'll take care of it tonight.

12:00.548 --> 12:01.513
Right now?

12:03.782 --> 12:05.315
Yeah, I have a business meeting.

12:09.092 --> 12:11.161
Have a good day at work, honey.

12:14.463 --> 12:15.528
Making an approach to a bad

12:15.597 --> 12:17.229
guy isn't always about seeming

12:17.298 --> 12:20.048
scary, intimidating,
or even smart.

12:20.049 --> 12:21.381
A certain kind of target needs

12:21.450 --> 12:23.082
to feel superior, so if getting

12:23.151 --> 12:24.885
the job done means letting them

12:24.886 --> 12:26.734
be the dominant force
in the room...

12:26.735 --> 12:28.722
Shop's closed!
Everyone out!

12:28.885 --> 12:29.965
Now!

12:29.966 --> 12:32.043
You step back and let
them do exactly that.

12:32.725 --> 12:35.106
You deaf, dumb, or just
looking to get hurt?

12:37.477 --> 12:38.660
I'm looking to get paid, bro.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.701
Yogurt lady's dead husband owed
me money, too.

12:40.812 --> 12:42.676
- The name's Trey.
- Get in line.

12:43.268 --> 12:45.186
She don't give anybody a nickel
till I'm done with her.

12:45.187 --> 12:46.721
You know, she figured
you'd say that.

12:46.722 --> 12:48.089
And for a second there,
I was nervous.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.202
Two of us trying to collect, and
she's tapped out?

12:50.404 --> 12:52.188
It's like squeezing
juice from a stone.

12:52.189 --> 12:52.989
You mean blood.

12:53.058 --> 12:55.313
No, no.
Pretty sure it's juice.

12:55.340 --> 12:58.009
So she mentions you've been
hassling her about some boat.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.971
- And ding -- I have an idea.
- Not interested.

12:59.972 --> 13:01.012
Hey, I know you're a busy man.

13:01.021 --> 13:02.703
I'm just asking for
five minutes, okay?

13:02.846 --> 13:04.467
If the yogurt lady's
daddy has a boat,

13:04.468 --> 13:06.413
I am exactly the guy you
should be talking to.

13:06.716 --> 13:10.113
I don't like your ugly shirt,
I don't like your smart mouth,

13:10.114 --> 13:11.788
and I don't like you.

13:11.789 --> 13:12.866
I do things my way.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.166
Well, let's do it your way.
Okay.

13:14.236 --> 13:16.857
You want to do it your way?
Let's do it your way!

13:19.641 --> 13:21.445
Hand over the boat, yogurt lady!

13:21.446 --> 13:22.512
Don't get me wrong.

13:22.581 --> 13:24.162
I like breaking stuff as much as
the next guy.

13:24.407 --> 13:27.243
But according to the DMV, that
boat belongs to her daddy, so

13:27.244 --> 13:27.779
smashing counters isn't going to
make it yours, is it?

13:28.980 --> 13:30.046
You want to turn it into nice,

13:30.114 --> 13:31.714
untraceable cash?

13:31.783 --> 13:33.449
Then I'm who you want to talk

13:33.518 --> 13:36.753
to, using a little system I like
to call the Trey system.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.076
- Which is?
- I have a buddy.

13:39.077 --> 13:41.904
I used to do this back in Vegas.
I called him the magician.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.695
Forges documents.

13:43.696 --> 13:45.696
I can get us papers that make
that boat yours.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.096
You cash out said boat --

13:48.097 --> 13:50.831
dollar bills rain from the sky.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.611
You're listening to
Trey now, aren't you?

13:53.612 --> 13:55.603
All right.

13:55.604 --> 13:57.615
You just earned a
date with my boss.

14:11.454 --> 14:12.821
As a spy, you get used to

14:12.890 --> 14:14.223
people having whispered

14:14.292 --> 14:15.391
conversations about you.

14:15.460 --> 14:17.211
It's a little like
being in high school.

14:17.212 --> 14:20.111
But when people are whispering
about you in algebra, they're a

14:20.112 --> 14:22.831
lot less likely to try and kill
you afterward.

14:29.130 --> 14:30.763
You worked with a crew in Vegas?

14:30.832 --> 14:31.576
Crew?
No.

14:31.577 --> 14:33.179
Just one buddy.
He's the guy I told you about.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.763
So only one deadbeat back
there knows

14:34.764 --> 14:36.689
you're here sticking
your nose where it don't belong.

14:36.690 --> 14:38.145
Chief, it's not like that.

14:38.146 --> 14:39.598
I thought I had an
opportunity here.

14:39.599 --> 14:41.365
Hey, what kind of a man would
I be if I let just anybody walk

14:41.468 --> 14:43.382
in here and tell me how
to run my business?

14:43.865 --> 14:45.787
Vic, take this guy back.
Work on his manners.

14:45.866 --> 14:46.632
Hey, hey, hey.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.901
You don't like him,
you don't like him.

14:48.970 --> 14:50.325
The guy's got a plan.
Hear him out.

14:52.941 --> 14:55.047
I think Carter's got
a soft spot for you.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.454
Isn't that sweet.

14:58.501 --> 15:00.220
Nah. He just knows a smart
idea when he sees one.

15:00.221 --> 15:01.783
You've been waiting on this
yogurt lady's boat

15:01.784 --> 15:02.902
for what -- a month now?

15:02.903 --> 15:05.800
There's more than one way to
skin a cat's hair off its body.

15:06.217 --> 15:07.945
My guy in Vegas, he can make

15:07.946 --> 15:10.684
title documents appear
out of thin air.

15:10.892 --> 15:13.356
I know that drill.
Too bad I don't like magic.

15:13.392 --> 15:15.673
Do you like money?
Do you like money?

15:15.674 --> 15:18.957
I got watermarks, renewal
notices, state registration.

15:18.958 --> 15:20.987
This guy can even toss in a fake
repair history.

15:21.051 --> 15:22.848
Nah.
Something always splashes back.

15:22.849 --> 15:25.032
They want to sue you.
They repossess the boat.

15:25.284 --> 15:26.316
I don't know who broke your

15:26.385 --> 15:27.751
heart in the past,
but it wasn't me.

15:27.820 --> 15:28.619
These forged documents are so

15:28.687 --> 15:31.455
good, they make real
ones look fake.

15:34.538 --> 15:35.820
I just want my money.

15:35.880 --> 15:38.113
Then let's see what he can do.

15:38.182 --> 15:39.761
And nothing's going
to splash back.

15:39.762 --> 15:41.356
Once we get our new boat,

15:41.463 --> 15:44.360
I'll take yogurt lady and her daddy
on a trip to the Everglades.

15:44.455 --> 15:47.440
They're dead, they
can't sue nobody.

15:49.260 --> 15:51.517
Fine.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.998
But if this goes sideways,
Vegas, some gator's going to be

15:54.999 --> 15:58.292
making swamp fertilizer
out of you, too.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.343
I know it sounds scary, but
we can still make it work.

16:07.543 --> 16:09.176
I'm in with the loan sharks now.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.810
What difference does
that even make?

16:10.967 --> 16:12.003
I mean, they're planning on killing

16:12.004 --> 16:13.692
Jessica whether she hands over
the boat or not.

16:16.175 --> 16:17.364
I mean, don't worry.

16:17.365 --> 16:18.854
We're not going to
let them, um --

16:20.134 --> 16:22.335
uh, Nate's right. We're not
going to let them kill you.

16:22.347 --> 16:24.677
That's why we're going to do
more than just get you mixed up

16:24.678 --> 16:25.949
with a police investigation.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.184
We're going to make Carter look
like an undercover cop.

16:28.746 --> 16:30.935
His boss is going to have to
remove him from the equation,

16:30.936 --> 16:32.772
you're off the hook, and Miami

16:32.773 --> 16:34.699
has one less sociopath
to worry about.

16:34.867 --> 16:38.713
I like that you're so confident,
but is that even possible?

16:38.864 --> 16:40.497
It's not as crazy as it sounds.

16:40.566 --> 16:41.899
Carter's never been arrested,

16:41.967 --> 16:43.067
he's from out of town, and he's

16:43.135 --> 16:44.585
moving up the
ladder pretty fast.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.385
Throw in a police boat and a

16:45.453 --> 16:47.291
service-issue Glock planted at

16:47.292 --> 16:49.333
his place, he might as well be
wearing a badge.

16:49.335 --> 16:50.765
Right.
I love this idea.

16:50.766 --> 16:52.243
- What can I do?
- You're coming with me.

16:52.244 --> 16:53.775
We're going to keep
tabs on Carter.

16:53.823 --> 16:56.708
Just keep your head down for the
next few days, and we'll let you

16:56.752 --> 16:58.163
know when they're gone for good.

16:59.386 --> 17:00.185
You be all right.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.768
Okay.
Thanks.

17:15.804 --> 17:17.868
Carter's making another
collection, which should give us

17:17.869 --> 17:19.665
a chance to get to his car.

17:24.526 --> 17:25.498
That's pretty small.

17:25.499 --> 17:26.884
This is really going to lead us
to his place?

17:27.425 --> 17:30.793
That's the magic of
GPS satellites, Nate.

17:30.862 --> 17:32.904
You need to place it
under his wheel well.

17:33.026 --> 17:35.388
Yeah.
Okay.

17:35.548 --> 17:37.147
By the way, that shirt
looks good on you.

17:37.871 --> 17:39.938
I mean, of course, it does look
better on me, but it looks

17:39.939 --> 17:40.844
pretty good on you.

17:40.845 --> 17:42.320
I'm burning it after
this is over.

17:43.757 --> 17:45.094
Harsh.

17:46.636 --> 17:49.230
Well, in any case, this might be
our best chance.

17:49.607 --> 17:51.530
Looks like they're
pretty occupied.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.638
Yeah, with barbecuing a
motorcycle dealership.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.248
That's gasoline.

17:56.527 --> 17:58.326
Change of plans.
I'm going inside, see if I can

17:58.327 --> 18:00.035
move this along and keep Carter
from hurting anyone.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.786
You plant the tracker, Nate.

18:01.787 --> 18:03.153
Don't make any mistakes.

18:03.220 --> 18:05.555
We may only get one
chance at this.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.912
Next time, it's your skull!

18:13.913 --> 18:14.946
Please, stop.

18:14.947 --> 18:17.439
You destroy my bikes, I
can't get you your money.

18:17.440 --> 18:19.073
That was last week's excuse.

18:19.074 --> 18:20.959
Seems like we're not
getting through to you.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.679
No, please, stop!
I'm begging you!

18:36.729 --> 18:39.653
You know, they say there's nothing
worse than burning to death.

18:39.654 --> 18:41.049
I can get your money next week.

18:41.050 --> 18:43.712
Yeah, your skin sizzles
right off your body.

18:44.239 --> 18:46.785
Your lungs sear
from the hot air.

18:47.041 --> 18:50.674
You gag from the smell of
your own burning flesh.

18:51.686 --> 18:52.483
Ha!

18:52.484 --> 18:53.039
Hey, there you are.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.459
I been calling you, bro.

18:54.579 --> 18:55.628
What the hell
are you doing here?

18:55.629 --> 18:56.760
Why aren't you
picking up your phone?

18:56.761 --> 18:57.549
I told you I'd call you.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.447
Now get lost!

18:58.448 --> 19:01.500
What, right after your whole murder
and arson in broad daylight?

19:01.638 --> 19:02.980
You going to call me from jail?

19:02.981 --> 19:04.169
Damn it. Look what you did.

19:04.170 --> 19:05.061
Ohh!

19:05.085 --> 19:07.328
Damn, bro! Little harsh.

19:07.329 --> 19:09.014
Should put a bullet
in your head right now.

19:09.015 --> 19:11.485
Only if you don't care about
getting yogurt lady's boat.

19:11.486 --> 19:12.615
My guy called.

19:12.616 --> 19:13.800
The papers are ready.

19:15.302 --> 19:16.982
Fine. Go get them. Set it up.

19:16.983 --> 19:17.715
The sooner this is over,

19:17.716 --> 19:19.408
the sooner I never
have to see you again.

19:20.150 --> 19:20.986
Hot bike.

19:30.575 --> 19:31.526
How'd it go?

19:31.548 --> 19:32.536
I've had better jobs.

19:32.537 --> 19:33.644
You plant the tracker?

19:35.924 --> 19:36.798
N-no.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.623
You said you were
going to do that, right?

19:40.745 --> 19:42.457
Dude, I'm messing with you, bro.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.302
I put it under the rear wheel well.

19:44.342 --> 19:45.025
God.

19:45.026 --> 19:46.757
You really weren't kidding
about being out of it.

19:55.686 --> 19:57.629
When you're running
an official operation,

19:57.630 --> 20:00.045
the mission is over when
your superiors say it is.

20:00.046 --> 20:02.146
Documents are locked away
to a basement vault,

20:02.147 --> 20:03.435
and you walk away.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.861
When you're investigating
events from your own life,

20:05.905 --> 20:07.672
it's harder to turn the page.

20:07.812 --> 20:09.797
Even if you've
read a file 10 times,

20:09.798 --> 20:11.643
it might still hold a secret.

20:17.033 --> 20:17.984
Hey.

20:18.277 --> 20:21.261
Nate and I found Carter's
apartment in Coconut Grove.

20:21.262 --> 20:24.454
It shouldn't be too hard to
sneak in once he's gone.

20:24.455 --> 20:25.699
It should be empty
tomorrow morning.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.153
Sam just swapped out
the boats up in Boca.

20:28.154 --> 20:29.423
I'm going to take
Carter up there,

20:29.424 --> 20:30.842
so you should have a few hours.

20:30.868 --> 20:31.817
Great.

20:31.956 --> 20:35.085
That gives me more time than I
need to hide our little gift.

20:36.546 --> 20:39.309
One cellphone, complete with
call log to the local precinct.

20:39.310 --> 20:41.544
And one body-wire rig.

20:42.478 --> 20:45.762
And a police-issue Glock.

20:47.223 --> 20:49.639
Everything to make Carter
look like an undercover cop

20:49.681 --> 20:51.409
but a box of doughnuts.

20:52.482 --> 20:53.588
It's perfect, Fi.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.995
I see someone's been doing
a little spring shredding.

21:01.624 --> 21:02.690
It feel good?

21:03.161 --> 21:06.296
Look, I know it's hard to
leave your past behind,

21:07.561 --> 21:09.596
but it's for the best.

21:09.597 --> 21:11.111
You'll sleep easier.

21:11.985 --> 21:13.927
Unless I keep you up.

21:23.351 --> 21:24.758
Bad guys, like most people,

21:24.759 --> 21:28.075
aren't big on checking the
details in legal documents,

21:28.076 --> 21:31.291
which makes fine print a
powerful weapon for a spy.

21:31.292 --> 21:35.083
Altering information on
subsection 10 of a title deed

21:35.084 --> 21:36.468
may not be very exciting,

21:36.469 --> 21:39.464
but when that information makes
a loan shark look like a cop,

21:39.465 --> 21:41.582
it can be as deadly as a bullet.

21:43.422 --> 21:44.209
Congratulations.

21:44.210 --> 21:46.342
We're proud owners of the Skylark II.

21:48.556 --> 21:49.251
You weren't kidding.

21:49.252 --> 21:50.644
Your guy's got skills.

21:50.645 --> 21:52.104
I'll pick up the boat this afternoon.

21:52.105 --> 21:52.816
Well, let's go now.

21:52.817 --> 21:54.603
I arranged my day so we could
both drive up to Boca.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.243
Tough luck.

21:55.244 --> 21:56.175
I got things to do.

21:56.176 --> 21:57.755
Stuff that's more important
than getting rich?

21:57.756 --> 21:58.644
Oh, come on.

21:58.645 --> 22:00.402
It'll take two hours.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.223
Okay, okay.

22:01.224 --> 22:01.991
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:01.992 --> 22:02.980
I see what's happening.

22:02.981 --> 22:04.732
You're trying to cut out the middleman.

22:04.733 --> 22:06.341
Don't look a gift horse in the teeth.

22:06.342 --> 22:07.417
You mean mouth.

22:07.418 --> 22:08.420
No, I think it's teeth.

22:08.421 --> 22:10.662
Point is, you never cut out Trey.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.543
I'm not cutting you out.

22:11.544 --> 22:13.049
I'll call you when
I have your money.

22:13.050 --> 22:15.313
Look, Trey is not leaving --

22:15.314 --> 22:16.607
I just detailed this car.

22:16.608 --> 22:18.171
I don't want to
have to detail it again.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.436
Trey is leaving.

22:20.564 --> 22:22.495
So, how are you going
to handle the sale?

22:22.496 --> 22:24.096
Do you got someone
who can sell the boat?

22:24.097 --> 22:26.216
What's the timeline thing
for sort of the --

22:26.217 --> 22:28.887
Are you going to advertise
on the worldwide web?

22:35.599 --> 22:37.202
Hey, Mikey, we're
in Carter's place now,

22:37.203 --> 22:39.442
planting his little
undercover-cop stash.

22:39.443 --> 22:42.262
Aren't you supposed to be with
Carter driving up to Boca?

22:42.263 --> 22:43.114
He had other ideas.

22:43.115 --> 22:44.333
You got a bead on the car?

22:44.334 --> 22:45.738
I'll take a look.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.187
He say anything about
where he was headed?

22:47.188 --> 22:49.721
No, he wasn't particularly chatty.

22:51.785 --> 22:52.801
Oh, crap, Mike.

22:52.802 --> 22:53.614
He's heading home.

22:53.615 --> 22:54.384
He's heading right here,

22:54.385 --> 22:56.192
and he's close.

22:56.193 --> 22:58.781
Sam, get out of there now.

22:58.782 --> 22:59.772
What? He's driving here now?

22:59.773 --> 23:01.374
Yeah. I'll buy you
as much time as I can.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.566
Plant the stash.

23:02.567 --> 23:03.585
I'm on it.

23:11.167 --> 23:13.150
Stalling someone
with a car accident

23:13.151 --> 23:15.497
is about calibrating the
perfect amount of impact.

23:15.498 --> 23:16.938
You don't want to
cause a major injury

23:16.939 --> 23:18.346
or create a massive scene.

23:18.347 --> 23:19.669
You just need enough contact

23:19.670 --> 23:21.779
to keep your target from
leaving right away,

23:22.464 --> 23:23.764
and it's all about the timing.

23:23.765 --> 23:27.301
You want to make them--
hit you.

23:35.596 --> 23:36.743
Hey, buddy.

23:36.744 --> 23:37.868
What the hell was that?

23:37.869 --> 23:38.777
You trying to kill me?

23:38.778 --> 23:39.824
You pulled out in front of me.

23:39.825 --> 23:40.609
That was your fault.

23:40.610 --> 23:41.917
Oh, my back.

23:41.918 --> 23:42.907
Oh, I didn't hit you that hard.

23:42.908 --> 23:43.883
Look, there's almost no damage.

23:43.884 --> 23:44.804
Just call it even.

23:44.805 --> 23:47.190
Even? You could have
crushed my spinal cord!

23:47.191 --> 23:48.379
Oh, okay.

23:48.380 --> 23:49.686
Is that the way it's going to be, huh?

23:49.687 --> 23:50.649
You going to extort me?

23:50.650 --> 23:51.353
You want it?

23:51.354 --> 23:52.456
Here, take this.

23:52.457 --> 23:53.207
I'm leaving.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.146
How dare you!

23:54.147 --> 23:55.144
First you run into me.

23:55.145 --> 23:56.561
Now you're trying to buy me off?

23:56.562 --> 23:57.760
Oh, get lost.

23:57.761 --> 23:58.466
No, no.

23:58.467 --> 23:59.389
Oh, no.

23:59.390 --> 24:00.189
Where do you think you're going,

24:00.190 --> 24:01.076
Mr. hit-and-run?

24:01.077 --> 24:02.008
Get lost!

24:02.009 --> 24:04.759
R72A3T--
that's your license plate,

24:04.760 --> 24:06.264
and I am calling the cops.

24:06.265 --> 24:07.820
You're not calling the cops.

24:07.821 --> 24:09.208
I told you to take off,

24:09.209 --> 24:10.964
or I'll give you
some real injuries.

24:10.965 --> 24:12.798
Okay, I'm willing to make a deal.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.356
I told you to get lost!

24:14.357 --> 24:15.538
Okay, just give me the cash.

24:15.539 --> 24:16.559
How about that?

24:17.733 --> 24:19.559
You got to at least admit
that you're wrong.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.496
I'm going to make a citizen's arrest.

24:21.497 --> 24:22.153
Okay.

24:22.154 --> 24:23.623
Apartment 22.

24:23.624 --> 24:24.539
Get out of here.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.133
You jerk!

24:45.084 --> 24:46.486
I broke a nail.

24:49.733 --> 24:50.782
The pieces are in place.

24:50.783 --> 24:51.878
There's a service-issue.

24:51.879 --> 24:53.361
40-cal hidden in Carter's floor,

24:53.362 --> 24:54.615
and they're heading for the boat.

24:54.616 --> 24:57.893
So now you can accuse Carter
of being an undercover cop.

24:57.894 --> 24:58.846
Well, almost.

24:58.847 --> 25:01.271
First, we need Carter to give
his boss the boat, right?

25:01.272 --> 25:02.981
Here we go, Mike.

25:02.982 --> 25:05.455
Radio's playing my favorite song.

25:05.456 --> 25:07.913
Carter's showing off the new
boat to Wallace right now.

25:07.914 --> 25:09.918
The guy's going to need
rotator-cuff surgery the way

25:09.919 --> 25:11.542
he's patting himself on the back.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.380
Thought you and Vegas were
hunting this down together.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.265
Where is he?

25:14.266 --> 25:14.988
I don't know.

25:14.989 --> 25:16.894
That guy caught a lucky
break running into us,

25:16.895 --> 25:18.670
but I'm ready to be done with him.

25:18.671 --> 25:20.659
This thing has a nav system.

25:20.660 --> 25:22.408
Outrigger's a tuna tower.

25:22.409 --> 25:23.816
Pretty sweet, huh?

25:23.817 --> 25:25.649
I told you I should be
hunting bigger game.

25:25.650 --> 25:26.969
Let me see those title papers.

25:26.970 --> 25:27.604
Here.

25:27.605 --> 25:28.778
Good as advertised.

25:28.779 --> 25:30.653
You put me in the
position to make plays,

25:30.654 --> 25:32.227
I score every time.

25:32.228 --> 25:34.642
Selling this will bring
half a mill, easy.

25:34.643 --> 25:36.453
That's how valuable I am.

25:36.454 --> 25:38.103
But let me check out your books.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.707
I'll find you other ways to
turn your accounts into hard,

25:40.708 --> 25:41.959
cold cash.

25:41.960 --> 25:42.993
You did good, Carter.

25:42.994 --> 25:44.717
Now relax.

25:44.718 --> 25:47.574
See, the guy is using the boat
to move up in Wallace's crew --

25:47.575 --> 25:48.467
It's perfect.

25:48.468 --> 25:49.907
Yeah, we got him right
where we want him.

25:49.908 --> 25:50.793
What's next?

25:50.794 --> 25:52.739
Well, now we got to bring
in our friend Jesse.

25:52.740 --> 25:53.753
Get him in place.

25:53.754 --> 25:55.168
Mike, he's doing it
on his lunch hour,

25:55.169 --> 25:56.276
so we got to make it snappy.

25:56.277 --> 25:57.985
It's time to give
Wallace some bad news

25:57.986 --> 25:59.912
about his employee of the month.

26:07.631 --> 26:10.171
Hey, chief, can I get those
papers, you know, from the boat?

26:10.172 --> 26:11.648
Uh, turns out
I'm not a fan of Miami,

26:11.649 --> 26:12.737
so if I could
get those papers --

26:12.738 --> 26:14.139
No way.
That's not the way it works.

26:14.140 --> 26:14.702
We sell the boat. We get you--

26:14.703 --> 26:15.764
No, no, no.
I don't want the money.

26:15.765 --> 26:16.455
You can keep the share.

26:16.456 --> 26:17.403
You know, I changed my mind.

26:17.404 --> 26:19.110
I'm going to move back to Vegas.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.226
Wait a minute.

26:20.227 --> 26:21.118
What is going on?

26:21.119 --> 26:22.218
Nothing. It's complicated.

26:22.219 --> 26:22.727
You know what? Forget it.

26:22.728 --> 26:23.863
I'll just go.

26:25.047 --> 26:27.009
Now, let me make it simple for you.

26:27.010 --> 26:28.237
Why are you trying to blow town?

26:28.238 --> 26:28.888
No, no, no, no, no.

26:28.889 --> 26:29.629
I just --

26:29.630 --> 26:31.504
D-don't shoot the guy with
the message, all right?

26:31.505 --> 26:33.188
Your boy Carter set us up.

26:33.189 --> 26:34.512
That fishing boat he found,

26:34.513 --> 26:36.314
it belongs to the Miami P.D.

26:36.315 --> 26:37.816
According to who?

26:37.817 --> 26:38.613
According to the truth.

26:38.614 --> 26:39.383
I saw the photos.

26:39.384 --> 26:40.397
I can't get mixed up with this.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.619
I want to see those photos.

26:41.620 --> 26:42.446
I don't have them with me.

26:42.447 --> 26:43.808
A guy -- he tips me off.

26:43.809 --> 26:45.127
I -- I can't get arrested.

26:45.128 --> 26:47.211
Well, there's worse things
than getting arrested.

26:47.212 --> 26:50.370
Now let's go and see the photos.

27:03.647 --> 27:04.784
You got a cop tipping you off?

27:04.785 --> 27:05.591
No, no, no, no, no, no.

27:05.592 --> 27:06.635
This guy Fickas is a clerk.

27:06.636 --> 27:08.049
He sits on the dispatch desk.

27:08.050 --> 27:09.066
When I move to a new place,

27:09.067 --> 27:10.910
I get an insurance policy --

27:10.911 --> 27:14.740
Somebody to keep an eye out for
any trouble coming my way.

27:14.741 --> 27:15.910
Are you kidding me?!

27:15.911 --> 27:17.742
Are you a stupid person?

27:17.743 --> 27:18.824
You brought them to my job?

27:18.825 --> 27:19.827
Are you serious?

27:19.828 --> 27:21.429
It wasn't my idea.

27:21.430 --> 27:22.824
I want to see some photos now.

27:22.825 --> 27:25.250
You -- you told him
about the photos?

27:25.251 --> 27:26.502
I'm not even
supposed to have these.

27:26.503 --> 27:27.381
Give me those.

27:27.382 --> 27:30.289
Okay -- you need to ease
up -- on the attitude.

27:30.290 --> 27:31.601
Fickas heard our names come up

27:31.602 --> 27:33.678
on the wire at the precinct.

27:33.679 --> 27:34.695
They were talking
about this boat.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.601
Yeah, I remember
the name Skylark II.

27:36.602 --> 27:37.985
So I did a little, uh --

27:37.986 --> 27:39.662
little poking around on
the drug-bust database.

27:39.663 --> 27:40.359
It turns out that

27:40.360 --> 27:43.361
your boat is from a coke
bust in Broward last year.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.601
I was on this boat yesterday.

27:44.602 --> 27:47.041
I told you that Carter is
mixed up with the cops.

27:47.042 --> 27:47.804
Mixed up with?

27:47.805 --> 27:48.365
No, no, no.

27:48.366 --> 27:51.846
I'd say it's a -- little
more than just that.

27:51.847 --> 27:53.574
You think he's undercover?

27:53.575 --> 27:54.510
Duh.

27:54.511 --> 27:55.714
How long you known
this Carter guy?

27:55.715 --> 27:56.283
No way.

27:56.284 --> 27:57.842
There's no way he's a cop.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.029
He's one of my top earners.

27:59.030 --> 27:59.847
That's how it works.

27:59.848 --> 28:00.998
Hundred bucks says
you prick his finger,

28:00.999 --> 28:01.785
he's bleeding blue,

28:01.786 --> 28:03.143
okay? You might want
to search his place.

28:03.144 --> 28:04.195
I'm going to need
those back. Thank you.

28:04.196 --> 28:04.875
Too bad.

28:04.876 --> 28:05.633
They're mine.

28:05.634 --> 28:06.984
Um, he's kind of a --

28:06.985 --> 28:09.513
photography aficionado there.

28:09.514 --> 28:10.620
I'll double your fee.

28:10.621 --> 28:13.232
You let me know if anything
else comes over the wire.

28:15.079 --> 28:16.076
Let's call the boys.

28:16.077 --> 28:17.540
We're going to pay
Carter a visit.

28:17.541 --> 28:18.352
That's a good idea.

28:18.353 --> 28:19.316
The millisecond you get back,

28:19.317 --> 28:20.571
I'm going to need those papers,
and I'm going to have --

28:20.572 --> 28:21.306
What are you talking about,

28:21.307 --> 28:22.596
Vegas? You're coming with me.

28:22.597 --> 28:23.601
And you better pray you're right,

28:23.602 --> 28:25.496
because somebody's going
to be eating a bullet.

28:30.141 --> 28:31.544
What the hell?

28:31.545 --> 28:32.879
What are you guys doing here?

28:32.880 --> 28:33.959
How's it going, officer?

28:33.960 --> 28:35.415
Or is it detective?

28:35.416 --> 28:36.250
What are you talking about?

28:36.251 --> 28:38.365
Recognize that boat, pig?

28:38.366 --> 28:40.215
Wallace, I don't know what
you thinks' going on, but --

28:40.216 --> 28:41.093
Shut up!

28:41.094 --> 28:43.035
Tear this place apart!

28:45.855 --> 28:47.590
You did this.
You switched the boats on me.

28:47.591 --> 28:49.466
Oh, yeah.
That's a funny one, cop.

28:49.467 --> 28:51.134
You've been after
that boat since day one.

28:51.135 --> 28:52.900
I just helped
with the phony title.

28:52.901 --> 28:54.420
I promise you, I'm not a cop.

28:54.421 --> 28:55.613
There's nothing to find!

28:55.614 --> 28:57.090
Oh, you're trying to blame me?

28:57.091 --> 28:59.924
That's like the kettle insulting the pot.

29:00.451 --> 29:02.450
I've been
a soldier for you, boss.

29:02.451 --> 29:04.709
I -- I've expanded your territory.

29:04.710 --> 29:05.772
I made you money.

29:05.773 --> 29:07.147
I -- I've bled for you.

29:07.148 --> 29:08.449
Looks like you're going to
bleed a little bit more.

29:08.450 --> 29:10.233
Now shut the hell up.

29:11.330 --> 29:12.317
Nothing!

29:12.318 --> 29:15.116
Well, check for hidden
compartments, hollow books.

29:15.117 --> 29:16.292
Check the freezer.

29:16.293 --> 29:18.054
Hey, we better
find something, Vegas.

29:18.055 --> 29:19.318
Check behind the toilet,

29:19.319 --> 29:20.383
check under the rug.

29:20.384 --> 29:22.137
I promise you,
there's nothing to find!

29:22.138 --> 29:23.202
I'm not a cop!

29:23.203 --> 29:24.805
One of you is lying to me.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.525
Well, it isn't me.

29:25.526 --> 29:26.433
I'm trying to help you.

29:26.434 --> 29:27.955
Check everywhere.

29:27.956 --> 29:29.231
Maybe under the floorboard.

29:29.232 --> 29:32.681
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo --

29:32.682 --> 29:34.730
Shoot a rat in the throat.

29:34.731 --> 29:36.336
You can search everywhere, boss.

29:36.337 --> 29:37.037
It doesn't matter.

29:37.038 --> 29:38.586
There's nothing to find.

29:41.341 --> 29:43.305
Check behind that painting.

29:45.175 --> 29:47.671
One of the most powerful
techniques in a spy's arsenal

29:47.672 --> 29:50.224
is accusing a bad guy of being a good guy.

29:50.225 --> 29:53.604
Your enemy's associates dispatch
their version of justice

29:53.605 --> 29:55.904
faster than any law-enforcement agency,

29:55.905 --> 29:58.136
but they're often more ruthless.

30:00.850 --> 30:02.321
Of course, that's the same reason

30:02.322 --> 30:03.759
that spies live in fear of the day

30:03.760 --> 30:06.643
they accidentally accuse
one of the good guys --

30:08.791 --> 30:10.660
of being a good guy.

30:12.564 --> 30:14.538
Oh, hello.

30:14.539 --> 30:18.347
Gee, I wonder if these kids
know that their daddy's a rat.

30:18.348 --> 30:21.924
I guess they can tell themselves
he died doing his job.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.426
Too bad, piggy.

30:26.427 --> 30:27.912
Weren't fast enough, huh?

30:27.913 --> 30:28.865
Get him out of here.

30:28.866 --> 30:30.245
You do not want to do this.

30:30.246 --> 30:32.309
I'm with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

30:32.310 --> 30:34.886
Anything happens to me, you
all get death sentences.

30:34.887 --> 30:36.942
Well, I suggest
you get me in handcuffs

30:36.943 --> 30:41.596
before you start yammering on about
putting me in a gas chamber!

30:41.597 --> 30:45.480
Your little fed friends are
never going to see you again!

30:45.481 --> 30:46.455
Please don't do this.

30:46.456 --> 30:47.816
Get him out of here.

30:52.211 --> 30:53.782
I won't forget this.

30:53.783 --> 30:55.244
You did good, Vegas.

31:00.863 --> 31:03.366
When people are whipped
into a murderous frenzy,

31:03.367 --> 31:06.147
standing between them and their
target can get you killed.

31:06.148 --> 31:06.880
To stay in the game,

31:06.882 --> 31:09.741
you have to seem just as
crazy as everyone else.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.589
You son of a bitch!

31:11.590 --> 31:12.909
Please.

31:12.910 --> 31:14.141
You do not want to kill me.

31:14.142 --> 31:15.052
Get back!

31:15.053 --> 31:16.299
I'm going to end this.

31:16.300 --> 31:18.565
You have to come up with a
reason you need to stay close

31:18.566 --> 31:20.382
and the target
needs to stay alive.

31:20.383 --> 31:21.245
Well, no.

31:21.246 --> 31:22.177
What are you doing?

31:22.178 --> 31:25.623
You can't kill this bastard
till I ask him some questions.

31:25.624 --> 31:26.463
Excuse me?

31:26.464 --> 31:27.290
I'm in charge!

31:27.291 --> 31:28.006
Now move!

31:28.007 --> 31:30.456
You're in charge,
but we're both in danger.

31:30.457 --> 31:33.820
Let me pick his brain before
you blow his head off.

31:33.821 --> 31:35.904
Let me find out what the
Feds know about me.

31:35.905 --> 31:37.656
If you were smart,
you'd do the same thing.

31:37.657 --> 31:39.208
Fine. I got a spot
on Key Biscayne.

31:39.209 --> 31:40.394
I'll take him there,
I'll string him up.

31:40.395 --> 31:42.126
I'll tell you what I find out.

31:42.127 --> 31:44.771
You're not the only one who
got stabbed in the back here!

31:44.772 --> 31:45.673
I have every right --

31:45.674 --> 31:47.225
This is my show!

31:47.226 --> 31:48.107
Yeah, it's your show,

31:48.108 --> 31:49.652
but what if the guy
coughs up something

31:49.653 --> 31:51.187
about a snitch in your crew

31:51.188 --> 31:52.648
and you want to find out more?

31:52.649 --> 31:54.117
Might be nice to bring a guy

31:54.118 --> 31:56.566
who's got an ear
on the pulse of the cops.

31:56.567 --> 31:58.205
Okay, okay, you can come along.

31:58.206 --> 32:00.252
Now get him in the car!

32:00.253 --> 32:02.235
All right, I'm going to call
my guy over at dispatch,

32:02.236 --> 32:03.727
see if he knows anything.

32:06.126 --> 32:08.455
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
you were right.

32:08.456 --> 32:11.273
Found a stash
in the wall at his place.

32:11.274 --> 32:12.354
You mean the floor.

32:12.355 --> 32:16.243
Yeah, that's right -- in the
wall, behind an ugly painting.

32:16.244 --> 32:16.943
Oh, wait, Mike,

32:16.944 --> 32:19.515
are you saying that Carter is
actually an undercover cop?

32:19.516 --> 32:20.934
Scumbag's a Fed.

32:20.935 --> 32:22.086
Going to take him
up to Key Biscayne,

32:22.087 --> 32:23.494
get the whole story out of him.

32:23.495 --> 32:25.409
Oh, boy. That's not good.
This is not good.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.376
Yeah, yeah, you're telling me.

32:27.377 --> 32:28.424
Okay, we need a plan.

32:28.425 --> 32:29.640
You're heading to Key Biscayne --

32:29.641 --> 32:30.628
We'll meet you at the causeway.

32:30.629 --> 32:31.907
We can tail you from there.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.253
All right, sounds good.

32:33.992 --> 32:35.998
Once you stop, we'll go in hard.

32:36.836 --> 32:38.024
No, stay out of sight.

32:38.025 --> 32:38.888
I'll get them running.

32:38.889 --> 32:40.402
You sweep them up.

32:41.516 --> 32:42.417
What'd he say?

32:42.418 --> 32:44.124
Nobody's missing Carter yet.

32:44.125 --> 32:47.377
Now, let's find out what this
pig's last words are going to be.

32:47.378 --> 32:48.756
Hold on.

32:48.757 --> 32:50.982
He had a toolbox
in his apartment.

32:50.983 --> 32:53.766
Go get me a pair of pliers
and a hammer.

32:54.586 --> 32:56.152
Son of a bitch!

32:56.153 --> 32:57.633
I'm undercover, too.

32:58.304 --> 33:01.202
When the trunk opens,
come out swinging.

33:01.895 --> 33:03.575
All right, let's go!

33:15.663 --> 33:16.852
Give me those pliers.

33:16.853 --> 33:18.395
Going to find out what
that son of a bitch knows.

33:18.396 --> 33:19.185
No!

33:19.186 --> 33:20.292
I'm going to handle this.

33:20.293 --> 33:20.987
How?

33:20.988 --> 33:22.776
I'm going to find out!

33:25.629 --> 33:27.000
What the hell?

33:30.034 --> 33:31.653
Which one of you
two tied him up?

33:31.654 --> 33:33.085
I'm going to shoot one
of you for that!

33:33.086 --> 33:34.607
Go get him!

33:42.262 --> 33:44.181
It takes a combination
of factors

33:44.182 --> 33:46.891
to create the fog of war
on a battlefield.

33:46.892 --> 33:49.059
But spies know even
a single weapon

33:49.060 --> 33:50.967
can be a serious distraction.

33:50.968 --> 33:53.584
It's hard not to look
where someone's firing,

33:53.585 --> 33:55.645
and gunshots are disorienting,

33:55.646 --> 33:57.759
especially at close range.

33:57.760 --> 33:58.876
What the hell?

33:58.877 --> 33:59.900
I'm out of ammo.

33:59.901 --> 34:00.821
You got some?

34:00.822 --> 34:02.133
That's all I got.

34:21.610 --> 34:22.364
What the hell?

34:22.364 --> 34:23.373
Stay quiet.

34:23.375 --> 34:24.659
We're on your side.

34:25.527 --> 34:26.650
Wait a minute.

34:26.652 --> 34:27.851
You're the guy
who crashed into me.

34:27.851 --> 34:28.860
No, actually,
you crashed into me,

34:28.860 --> 34:30.150
but that doesn't matter now.

34:30.150 --> 34:31.196
Who the hell are you guys?

34:31.197 --> 34:32.137
Look, I know you got questions,

34:32.138 --> 34:33.379
but they're going
to have to wait.

34:34.319 --> 34:35.734
It's all good.

34:43.685 --> 34:45.370
I think we should head back.

34:45.371 --> 34:46.610
Not yet.

34:47.384 --> 34:49.027
All right, you check over there,

34:49.027 --> 34:50.862
and I'll check over here.

34:54.723 --> 34:55.554
You got him?

34:55.556 --> 34:57.831
Yeah, he's safe, but he's
not our biggest fan.

34:57.832 --> 34:59.319
Been trying to collect
evidence on Wallace

34:59.320 --> 35:02.490
for the past six months, and
we just wrecked his case.

35:03.222 --> 35:04.359
Then let's put it back together.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.300
You get the cavalry heading
over to Wallace's place,

35:06.301 --> 35:08.736
and I'll find what
we need to put him away.

35:08.737 --> 35:10.317
Mike, you sure
you want to do this?

35:10.318 --> 35:12.078
This whole thing
is my fault, Sam,

35:12.079 --> 35:13.803
and I'm going to fix it.

35:14.986 --> 35:17.341
My friend's making a play
to take Wallace down.

35:17.342 --> 35:19.179
You up for giving
him a little help?

35:19.180 --> 35:20.997
Whatever it takes.

35:26.027 --> 35:28.078
How the hell did
you let him escape?

35:28.079 --> 35:29.267
We're all going to go to prison.

35:29.268 --> 35:30.964
Prison? It's going
to be worse than prison.

35:30.965 --> 35:32.363
We tried to murder a Fed.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.295
I'm calling my guys.

35:33.296 --> 35:34.643
I got somebody
at the port with a boat.

35:34.644 --> 35:35.690
He smuggles me out.

35:35.691 --> 35:37.288
They're not going to
extradite me from Cuba.

35:37.289 --> 35:39.327
Even if you can trust
the rest of your crew,

35:39.328 --> 35:40.922
you're going to live the
rest of your life off

35:40.923 --> 35:42.163
what's in your pocket?

35:42.164 --> 35:43.555
Well, you got
a better idea, Trey?

35:43.556 --> 35:44.876
I got a guy in Vegas.

35:44.877 --> 35:45.997
He can set us up.

35:45.998 --> 35:48.459
New names,
new licenses, new socials.

35:48.460 --> 35:50.961
In 48 hours,
he can give us new lives.

35:50.962 --> 35:52.448
All we need is cash.

35:52.449 --> 35:54.003
How much can
you get your hands on?

35:54.004 --> 35:55.912
Everything I got is at the office.

35:55.913 --> 35:57.394
Then that's where
we need to go right now.

35:57.395 --> 35:58.435
What are you -- insane?

35:58.436 --> 35:59.846
We're not going
anywhere near there.

35:59.847 --> 36:00.963
I talked to Fickas.

36:00.964 --> 36:02.233
The cops
don't know anything yet.

36:02.234 --> 36:03.441
Carter's on foot.

36:03.442 --> 36:05.810
We've got enough time
to grab your cash

36:05.811 --> 36:09.525
and the books on every debt
you have left to collect.

36:09.526 --> 36:10.882
We can do this.

36:10.883 --> 36:13.678
No. The smart move is running,
and I got to be smart.

36:13.679 --> 36:14.916
Listen to me!

36:14.917 --> 36:16.486
I was right about Carter,
wasn't I?

36:16.487 --> 36:18.725
You want to live the rest of
your life in a shack in Cuba?

36:18.726 --> 36:21.477
Or shake down high rollers
and fix fights in Vegas?

36:21.478 --> 36:23.263
I mean, from where I'm standing,

36:23.264 --> 36:25.079
it's not even a choice.

36:28.549 --> 36:30.044
We got at least a half an hour.

36:30.045 --> 36:31.256
Fickas texted me.

36:31.257 --> 36:34.056
The judge just signed a search
warrant for this place.

36:34.057 --> 36:35.473
We'll be long gone by then.

36:35.474 --> 36:36.559
Don't leave anything.

36:36.560 --> 36:37.103
Grab it.

36:37.104 --> 36:38.235
Grab it all.

36:38.236 --> 36:40.929
Meet me out back
in five minutes.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.477
The cops will be looking
for your car,

36:42.478 --> 36:43.590
so we should take mine.

36:43.591 --> 36:44.711
Smart.

36:44.712 --> 36:45.704
We're going to go far, Vegas.

36:45.705 --> 36:48.179
I got a good feeling about this.

36:48.180 --> 36:49.491
Me too.

36:54.481 --> 36:56.679
Hands behind your head!

37:00.314 --> 37:01.391
What the hell?

37:01.392 --> 37:04.371
Wallace, hands behind your head!

37:06.984 --> 37:08.719
Turn around!

37:12.498 --> 37:14.087
Get down on the ground!

37:14.088 --> 37:15.254
Down on the ground!

37:15.255 --> 37:18.287
Down on the ground now!

37:21.342 --> 37:22.196
You said I should wait to

37:22.197 --> 37:24.038
cuff you before talking about

37:24.039 --> 37:26.218
sending you to the gas chamber.

37:26.219 --> 37:27.640
Hate to correct you, boss,

37:27.641 --> 37:31.806
capital punishment in the state
of Florida is lethal injection.

37:35.686 --> 37:39.071
Very thoughtful of Wallace
to box up his files for us.

37:39.072 --> 37:41.198
Any chance
he's an undercover cop?

37:42.925 --> 37:44.494
You were pretty
convincing, Trey.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.641
So were you.

37:45.642 --> 37:48.193
How'd you get the feds to
let you torch that bike?

37:48.194 --> 37:50.384
Ah, sometimes you have
to cause a lot of damage

37:50.385 --> 37:52.018
to avoid hurting people.

37:52.019 --> 37:53.396
Probably sounds crazy.

37:53.397 --> 37:55.881
No, it makes perfect sense.

37:55.882 --> 37:58.799
Still trying to sort out everything
that happened back there,

37:58.800 --> 38:00.853
but if there's one thing
I know for certain --

38:01.735 --> 38:02.869
You saved my life.

38:02.870 --> 38:04.024
Thanks.

38:04.025 --> 38:05.515
It was the least I could do.

38:06.664 --> 38:09.613
And you, drive safe.

38:09.614 --> 38:10.878
Always.

38:13.684 --> 38:14.637
I should have seen it, Sam.

38:14.638 --> 38:17.262
It was way too easy to
make him look like a cop.

38:17.263 --> 38:18.714
Maybe, but you made it right.

38:18.715 --> 38:19.677
Barely.

38:19.678 --> 38:22.569
One bad break out there,
and a good man dies.

38:22.570 --> 38:24.705
Nobody said what we do is easy, Mike.

38:24.706 --> 38:26.630
I know you got to go talk
to Jessica, but come on --

38:26.631 --> 38:28.220
I'll buy you a beer.

38:38.275 --> 38:39.976
He had me terrified for weeks.

38:39.977 --> 38:41.724
Yeah, he was pretty convincing.

38:41.725 --> 38:44.343
But you would have just ended
up in Witness Protection.

38:44.344 --> 38:45.526
Well, in any event,

38:45.527 --> 38:46.682
you're safe now.

38:46.683 --> 38:47.891
Crime ring is gone,

38:47.892 --> 38:49.507
and the feds said
you get your money back.

38:49.508 --> 38:51.229
I wish there was more I
could do to thank you,

38:51.230 --> 38:53.517
but this will have to do.

38:54.973 --> 38:56.699
Free yogurt for life, bro.

38:56.700 --> 38:58.648
With unlimited toppings.

38:58.649 --> 39:00.379
I'll just take the yogurt.

39:02.437 --> 39:04.505
Hey, Mike, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

39:05.521 --> 39:07.259
It's not about the Charger.

39:08.333 --> 39:11.225
Fi told me that you were having
trouble getting by some stuff.

39:11.226 --> 39:12.563
I don't want a lecture, Nate.

39:12.564 --> 39:14.242
Well, I'm not lecturing you.

39:14.243 --> 39:16.439
Just saying I know a thing
or two about addiction.

39:16.440 --> 39:17.745
So you think I'm addicted to

39:17.746 --> 39:19.651
dealing with the people
who burned me?

39:20.846 --> 39:22.605
Look, I told you
why I left Vegas.

39:22.606 --> 39:25.264
I didn't tell you when I decided.

39:26.948 --> 39:30.137
Charlie was born 11:42
on a Thursday morning.

39:30.138 --> 39:32.506
You know where I was 11:42?

39:33.001 --> 39:34.473
I was at the Horseshoe,

39:34.474 --> 39:36.685
because I was up 700 bucks,

39:36.686 --> 39:38.587
and I couldn't leave the table.

39:38.588 --> 39:39.411
And that was it for me.

39:39.412 --> 39:41.802
That was --
that was rock bottom.

39:42.593 --> 39:45.068
I'm not telling you to stop doing
what you're doing, all right?

39:45.069 --> 39:48.699
Now, no one can make you stop --

39:48.700 --> 39:50.209
Not until you're ready.

39:51.327 --> 39:53.547
And it doesn't look
like you're ready.

39:54.286 --> 39:56.221
What do you think
I should do, Nate?

39:56.222 --> 39:59.725
I think you should
see this through. Right?

39:59.726 --> 40:02.155
I mean, either you're going to
find out that you're crazy,

40:02.156 --> 40:06.086
or maybe this thing with you
getting burned isn't over.

40:06.851 --> 40:08.727
Either way, it's going to hurt.

40:20.972 --> 40:22.398
Michael.

40:31.457 --> 40:33.145
You said you shredded those.

40:33.146 --> 40:34.133
I didn't actually say that.

40:34.134 --> 40:34.813
You said that.

40:34.814 --> 40:36.449
I just didn't correct you.

40:36.450 --> 40:37.355
I'm sorry, Fi.

40:37.356 --> 40:38.543
I just -- I found a thread,

40:38.544 --> 40:39.757
and when I pulled at it --
Michael,

40:39.758 --> 40:42.832
I'm -- worried.

40:43.585 --> 40:45.873
Fi, I'm not losing my mind.

40:46.322 --> 40:48.475
As the CIA was rounding up all
the people who burned me,

40:48.476 --> 40:50.552
I kept thinking all my
questions would be answered.

40:50.553 --> 40:51.273
But look at this.

40:51.274 --> 40:52.728
There are just
a lot of inconsistencies.

40:52.729 --> 40:53.568
Just little things --

40:53.569 --> 40:55.586
you know, fuel receipts
and docking papers --

40:55.587 --> 40:57.676
money transfers to nowhere.

40:57.677 --> 40:59.675
I answer one question,
another pops up.

40:59.676 --> 41:02.732
You're never going to answer
all the questions, Michael.

41:02.733 --> 41:05.533
There'll always be
another thread to pull.

41:06.850 --> 41:08.346
You have to move on.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.189
I know. I will.

41:09.190 --> 41:11.333
I just need to take
one more look.

41:11.334 --> 41:13.723
Just one more look, Fi.

41:18.743 --> 41:20.843
Come to bed, Michael.

41:20.844 --> 41:23.142
We'll look at these
together tomorrow.

41:23.143 --> 41:25.525
Okay, I'll be right there.

41:36.644 --> 41:38.107
Come to bed.

41:38.108 --> 41:40.465
I'll be right there.
