There it is,
you guys.

00:37.038 --> 00:39.505
The best roller coaster
in all of Quahog.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.941
The League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen: The Ride.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.777
You know, I think they kind
of figured that movie

00:44.779 --> 00:46.845
was going to turn out
to be bigger than it was.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.347
Oh, come on, Lois,
it'll be awesome.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.049
It simulas
all the fun .

00:50.051 --> 00:51.784
of, um...
w-what was it no?

00:51.786 --> 00:54.153
It was like a... like a
tall guy in a black hat

00:54.155 --> 00:55.821
and a cape or something?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.690
Yeah, yeah, and there
mask who wore a mask.

00:58.692 --> 00:59.958
And one guy
had an umbrella.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.161
Yeah, and I believe he
opened it at one point.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.829
Yeah, and it
wasn't overly long.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.164
Yeah, not-not
overly long.

01:05.166 --> 01:08.500
Sorry, sir, there's a weight
limit on this coaster.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.868
Oh, really,
what's the limit?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.670
The rule is you can't
look hilarious

01:11.672 --> 01:13.772
on this motor scooter.

01:14.674 --> 01:16.308
(laughing)

01:16.310 --> 01:17.943
I'm sorry, there's
just no way.

01:22.515 --> 01:24.817
Big news out of Six Flags
Columbus today,

01:24.819 --> 01:26.251
as they unveil
what promises to be

01:26.253 --> 01:28.821
the largest roller coaster
in the United States.

01:28.823 --> 01:29.922
That's right, Joyce.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.423
They call it The Holocaust.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.525
The ride has several
Jewish groups up in arms...

01:33.527 --> 01:36.662
as they go over
the first rise.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.997
No, I'm-I'm kidding.
They're actually pretty upset.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.032
Wow.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.433
I had heard about
the Holocaust,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.135
but I never believed it
till right now.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.870
I have to ride
that ride.

01:44.872 --> 01:46.972
Peter, come on, they're
that ride either.you

01:46.974 --> 01:48.307
You're overweight.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.842
Yeah, if you want to
ride that roller coaster,

01:49.844 --> 01:51.877
you're going to have
to go on a diet.

01:51.879 --> 01:52.778
A diet, huh?

01:52.780 --> 01:56.448
Well, I suppose you can start
by keeping a food journal,

01:56.450 --> 01:57.749
like Quagmire does.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.451
Yeah, in fact,
I got it right here.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.687
"Today I ate peaches...
ginger...

02:01.689 --> 02:03.755
honey... candy... olive..."
You know what?

02:03.757 --> 02:05.257
This is the wrong list.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.860
All right, if that's what it
takes to ride that ride,

02:07.862 --> 02:09.795
I am going on a diet.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.363
And I'm not stopping
till I look as good as my

02:11.365 --> 02:13.665
great Aunt "Legs-Go-All-The-
Way-Up" Griffin.

02:13.667 --> 02:17.002
Hey, baby, do those legs
go all the way up?

02:17.004 --> 02:19.171
Why, yes, they do.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.440
(screaming) Oh, my God!
You're a monster!

02:21.442 --> 02:22.641
Come back.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.743
My legs are shaved
like a little girl.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.815
Hey, what do you
got there, Peter?

02:29.817 --> 02:30.816
Rice cakes.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.417
Never had one, but
somebody told me

02:32.419 --> 02:34.653
this is a really good
way to start your diet.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.823
(screaming)

02:41.995 --> 02:44.263
(coughing and gagging)

02:46.199 --> 02:48.834
(retching)

02:48.836 --> 02:50.302
Who...

02:50.304 --> 02:52.804
who could think of such
a horrible thing?!

02:52.806 --> 02:54.206
(evil laughter)

02:54.208 --> 02:56.175
We know you not like
rice cake.

02:56.177 --> 02:59.044
♪ Ricey, ricey rice,
no one like rice cakes. ♪

02:59.046 --> 03:01.413
(gong chiming)

03:02.715 --> 03:04.316
All right, Peter, the
most important thing

03:04.318 --> 03:05.918
when you're on a diet
is willpower.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.686
Now I'm going to put
this steaming pie

03:07.688 --> 03:09.655
on the windowsill to cool.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.356
Now no matter how many
beckoning fingers

03:11.358 --> 03:13.659
that steam morphs into
or how badly it tries

03:13.661 --> 03:16.995
to sneak its way up your nose,
I want you to resist the urge

03:16.997 --> 03:18.764
to levitate
off the ground

03:18.766 --> 03:19.698
and float towards the pie.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.999
Doesn't seem too hard.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.936
All right, go
stand over there.

03:27.006 --> 03:30.042
(laughing)
No, you don't.

03:30.977 --> 03:34.846
No, no,
you can't go in there.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.182
No, no, stay out of there.
That's my special area!

03:37.184 --> 03:38.350
(screams)

03:38.352 --> 03:40.352
No, stop!

03:40.354 --> 03:41.787
I'm saying no!

03:41.789 --> 03:42.921
(screaming)

03:42.923 --> 03:44.623
What kind of pie is this?!

03:44.625 --> 03:46.425
Peter, it's making me watch!

03:50.530 --> 03:53.165
Peter, I don't understand why
we have to drive all the way

03:53.167 --> 03:55.300
to Ohio to ride a
stupid roller coaster.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.502
Yeah, besides, they're still
not going to let you on.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.271
You haven't actually
lost any weight.

03:59.273 --> 04:02.341
Oh, I think my lithe figure
would suggest otherwise.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.443
A girdle is not a substitute
for weight loss, Peter.

04:04.445 --> 04:05.711
Hey, I'm riding
that roller coaster,

04:05.713 --> 04:07.112
and that's all
there is to it.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.447
Now let's get out of here.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.881
This thing's squishing
all my organs around.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.384
(heart beating)

04:15.989 --> 04:18.690
There it is, kids.
Columbus, Ohio.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.459
Now remember, there
are no rules

04:20.461 --> 04:22.261
about who can wear
stretch pants here,

04:22.263 --> 04:24.263
so you're going to see
some pretty shocking things.

04:24.265 --> 04:27.032
Brian, is this
our vacation?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.367
Yeah.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.835
Oh.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.770
Are we trash?

04:31.772 --> 04:32.771
Kind of.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.006
Oh.

04:39.879 --> 04:42.147
I'm sorry, sir.
You're too fat
to ride the coaster.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.682
Aw, darn it.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.617
Yeah, why don't you go back
to your pond, hippo?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.685
(laughing)

04:46.687 --> 04:47.953
How about me, sir?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.788
Am I too fat to ride?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.756
No, you don't seem to be.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.625
(laughing crazily)

04:53.627 --> 04:55.594
Well, you got
to hand it to him.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.362
He had a dream
and he made it happen.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.764
That's what
the Wright Brothers did.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.500
So, how's your boyfriend,
Orville, doing?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.035
Ex-boyfriend,
if you don't mind.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.770
And who cares?

05:04.772 --> 05:06.538
He's probably off
in a barn somewhere

05:06.540 --> 05:08.807
working on a contraption
with that weird
brother of his.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.808
Ew.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.777
(both laughing)

05:11.779 --> 05:14.446
ORVILLE:
Ha-ha, bitch.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.515
You're so pretty. I miss you.

05:18.117 --> 05:19.818
(gears grinding)

05:25.124 --> 05:28.160
(crashing, people screaming)

05:28.162 --> 05:30.962
PETER:
Well, this has given me
a lot to think about.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.665
WOMAN (screaming):
My son is dead!

05:36.936 --> 05:39.938
We are going to have
to send that family money.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.139
I know we are.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.507
Mom, I'm hungry.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.042
Can we stop
and get some food?

05:44.044 --> 05:45.811
Well, I guess it is
close to dinnertime.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.245
Chris, Stewie,
you hungry?

05:48.948 --> 05:51.183
(yawning)

05:51.185 --> 05:52.918
What are you looking at?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.086
You going to propose?

05:54.088 --> 05:55.754
What?
Yeah, exactly.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.189
"What?" Eyes front.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.523
(engine sputtering)

05:58.525 --> 05:59.691
What the hell?!

06:04.630 --> 06:05.997
(loud hissing)

06:05.999 --> 06:08.433
Looks like it's the radiator.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.836
Well, we're just going to have
to find a local mechanic.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.537
On a Friday evening?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.805
I don't think we're going to
have any luck till Monday.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.942
Besides, probably not a lot
of mechanics around here.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.548
So, we're stuck here?

06:23.550 --> 06:25.117
Hey, Lois, you see
that barn out there?

06:25.119 --> 06:26.685
You know who
it was built by?

06:26.687 --> 06:28.286
♪ By... Mennonites.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.256
Well, I guess we better see if
there's a hotel or something.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.625
I can't believe we're
stuck in Amish country.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.227
Yeah, I thought
something was "a-mish."

06:45.838 --> 06:47.973
Hey, uh, excuse me, fella?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.708
Yeah, we're looking for a room.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.476
Are ye indeed, outsiders?

06:51.478 --> 06:54.212
We do not see many of
your folk in these parts,

06:54.214 --> 06:56.815
but we welcome all of God's
children in their hour of need.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.351
Well, actually, I think we need
it for more than an hour.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.620
Or do we, right, Lois?

07:01.622 --> 07:04.089
I-I do not last very long.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.595
Ugh, creepy. What's this?

07:10.597 --> 07:11.997
It's an Amish doll.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.465
They're not allowed
to have faces.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.933
Has something to
do with vanity.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.535
Looks like a cross-dressing
Cobra Commander.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.936
Who?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.771
Cobra Commander.
He's the head of Cobra.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.306
The bad guys from G.I. Joe.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.041
The guys who oddly
shout the name

07:23.043 --> 07:26.144
of their terrorist organization
as they're attacking.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.647
Guys, we're under attack.
By who?

07:28.649 --> 07:29.748
I don't know.

07:34.086 --> 07:36.955
Cobra!

07:36.957 --> 07:37.856
Oh, it's Cobra.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.357
Oh, of course.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.693
Look, they have the pictures
of the snakes on their planes.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.261
Duke, what have I been
saying for years?

07:43.263 --> 07:45.330
What makes a good
terrorist organization?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.499
Brand recognition.
Brand recognition.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.334
Mom, I can't stay here.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.970
There's no electricity, no
telephones, it's horrible.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.171
Excuse me.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.874
I assure you,
our community is quite pleasant.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.876
Perhaps I could
show thee around.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.811
(amorously):
Okay.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.012
My name is Eli.

08:01.014 --> 08:02.647
My parents run the inn.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.350
If there is anything we can do
to make your room more plain,

08:05.352 --> 08:06.785
do not be afraid to ask.

08:06.787 --> 08:07.786
Ah, we'll be all right.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.855
A hotel in Amish country
can't be any worse

08:09.857 --> 08:11.189
than staying in a youth hostel.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.591
Hi, I'd like a room.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.459
Uh, preferably one
where I have to sleep

08:14.461 --> 08:16.127
with my bag
taped to my body.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.797
We have one where some Italian
backpackers have laid out

08:18.799 --> 08:20.765
every item of clothing
they own on all of the beds.

08:20.767 --> 08:21.800
Oh, perfect.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.869
Will my bunkmates be
constantly talking about me

08:23.871 --> 08:24.936
in a foreign language?

08:24.938 --> 08:26.838
Yes, they will, sir.
Oh, great.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.673
Uh, also, I'm going to have
some mail delivered here

08:28.675 --> 08:31.109
and I want it to sit in
that box for four years.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.044
Oh, and what street
is the bathroom on?

08:35.948 --> 08:37.782
So, what do you do
for fun around here?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.785
We do chores and we watch
other people do chores.

08:40.787 --> 08:41.820
Sounds kind of boring.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.289
Alas, there are times
when I feel as if

08:44.291 --> 08:45.824
there is much of life
I am missing.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.493
Yeah, it'd be tough
having no technology.

08:48.495 --> 08:50.028
I don't think I could
live without my iPhone.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.796
You have an iPhone?

08:51.798 --> 08:53.131
Yeah. You've heard of it?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.433
Yes, but only because
people sometimes search

08:55.435 --> 08:57.202
for Amish farms
on their iPhones.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.670
Here comes one now.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.949
Thanks for a fun evening, Eli.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.285
And-and thanks
for being so nice to me.

09:13.287 --> 09:16.821
I think you are the
most fascinating girl
I have ever met, Meg.

09:18.958 --> 09:21.960
Here. I want you
to have this.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.595
Your iPhone?

09:23.597 --> 09:24.863
Yeah.

09:24.865 --> 09:27.866
I made you a playlist
of songs that I like.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.834
Who is this I am hearing?

09:29.836 --> 09:30.869
It's Avril Lavigne.

09:30.871 --> 09:32.337
Why does she shout at me?

09:32.339 --> 09:33.705
I don't know.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.840
Most of my music I just
get pressured to buy.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.776
Thank you for
this gift, Meg.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.419
Eli! What are you doing
with that outsider?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.321
Her name is Meg, Father.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.922
And I was just showing her
our community.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.324
You stay away from her.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.758
She will try
to corrupt you.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.126
That is not true, Father.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.328
Meg is wonderful.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.096
She is an outsider.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.864
She does not follow
the one true path.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.967
You are not to see
this girl again.

10:01.969 --> 10:04.002
Do you understand?
I forbid it.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.371
(dejected sigh)
Yes, sir.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.441
Now come home at once.

10:09.443 --> 10:12.377
And, as for you,

10:12.379 --> 10:15.914
I suggest you stay away
from my son, you harlot.

10:16.849 --> 10:20.752
(sobbing)

10:22.488 --> 10:25.090
Hey, there, young one,
why so sad?

10:25.092 --> 10:27.759
It's just that I really like
this boy, but his dad...

10:27.761 --> 10:28.793
Oh, look out.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.995
(loud smacks)
(screaming)

10:29.997 --> 10:31.262
Sorry, there.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.631
Didn't realize
how long it'd been

10:32.633 --> 10:34.699
since Ol' Dumper
did his business.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.201
He'll be done soon enough.

10:36.203 --> 10:38.203
(smacking continues)
Oh, maybe not.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.472
Doesn't sound
like pooping, does it?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.007
Sounds more like someone

10:42.009 --> 10:44.309
dropping sandwiches
off a rooftop.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.877
Watch out below, right?

10:45.879 --> 10:47.545
Look like Hacky Sacks.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.814
You'll be sorry
if you kick 'em, though.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.617
All righty, well he seems
to be all done now.

10:52.619 --> 10:53.785
You have a good evening...

10:53.787 --> 10:54.953
(smacking resumes)
Oh, my goodness.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.821
He must have gotten into
the chicken feed again.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.423
You'd think they'd know

10:58.425 --> 11:01.326
it wasn't in their diet,
but this is how they find out.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.395
You may want
to close your mouth.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.837
(sobbing)

11:12.839 --> 11:14.839
Meg, what's wrong?

11:14.841 --> 11:16.474
Eli's father,
Ezekiel, said

11:16.476 --> 11:19.010
that I can't see him
anymore! (sobs)

11:19.012 --> 11:21.880
He said I was trying
to corrupt his son!

11:21.882 --> 11:23.181
He did, did he?

11:23.183 --> 11:24.315
Well, that does it!

11:24.317 --> 11:26.518
We are gonna teach
this town how to dance!

11:26.520 --> 11:28.653
Oh, Meg, I'm so sorry.

11:28.655 --> 11:30.755
I'd try to talk
to Eli's father
for you, honey,

11:30.757 --> 11:32.490
but I don't know
if it's my place.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.858
Ezekiel wouldn't listen
to you anyway, Lois.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.026
You're a woman.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.028
These people live in
a patriarchal society.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.698
The only member of our family
whose word would carry

11:39.700 --> 11:41.433
any weight
would be Meg's father.

11:41.435 --> 11:44.169
Dad, will you talk
to Ezekiel?

11:44.171 --> 11:45.370
Will you tell him

11:45.372 --> 11:47.038
I'm not trying to
corrupt his son?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.039
Please?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.474
All right, I'll do it.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.176
But don't expect
any miracles.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.477
I'm not good
with confrontation.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.845
Like when I got stuck

11:53.847 --> 11:55.313
behind that giraffe
at the ballgame.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.848
Yeah! Nice hit!

11:56.850 --> 11:58.450
Frozen rope!
Awesome!

11:58.452 --> 11:59.417
What just happened?

11:59.419 --> 12:00.852
Ground rule double! Whoo!

12:00.854 --> 12:02.287
I couldn't
even see it.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.455
Yeah, it was something.

12:03.457 --> 12:05.290
Ducks on a pond!
Let's bring 'em in!

12:05.292 --> 12:06.624
Could you please
sit down?

12:06.626 --> 12:08.293
I am sitting down.
You sit up.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.327
I am sitting up,

12:09.329 --> 12:10.962
but I still can't see
a thing.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.363
Yeah, sounds
like a "you" problem.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.832
Let's go, Sox!

12:15.935 --> 12:17.168
Before we commence

12:17.170 --> 12:20.839
with Samuel Fisher's
barn raising, let us pray.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.006
Dear Amish Lord,

12:22.008 --> 12:25.643
thou looketh sternly down
upon us thine flock,

12:25.645 --> 12:27.812
even though we did not
do anything wrong

12:27.814 --> 12:31.349
and have been doing
chores like (bleep) crazy,

12:31.351 --> 12:34.285
please make us humble,
and deliver us more hardship,

12:34.287 --> 12:36.688
that we may get thick,
calloused hands,

12:36.690 --> 12:38.957
much larger
than other people's.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.793
And grant that we become dull,
like Eric Bana,

12:41.795 --> 12:43.294
who we have never seen,

12:43.296 --> 12:44.696
but are just going
by reputation

12:44.698 --> 12:46.798
because it is your will.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.033
We solemnly believe
that although humans

12:49.035 --> 12:51.002
have been around
for a million years,

12:51.004 --> 12:52.971
you feel strongly
that they had

12:52.973 --> 12:54.506
just the right amount
of technology

12:54.508 --> 12:57.842
between 1835 and 1850;

12:57.844 --> 12:59.878
not too little,
not too much.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.347
Please deliver us
from Thomas Edison,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.816
the worst human being
who ever lived.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.785
And protect us
from those who laugh

13:06.787 --> 13:08.920
at our buggies or our hats

13:08.922 --> 13:10.622
and deliver us
from mustaches.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.857
Amen.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.192
Hey, uh, Ezekiel?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.927
You must be Mr. Griffin.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.930
Look, I-I know you guys are busy
with your barn raising and all,

13:18.932 --> 13:20.999
but, um, you know,
I just wanted to tell you

13:21.001 --> 13:23.001
how much my daughter Meg loves
your boy Eli.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.703
I promise you, she ain't trying
to corrupt him or nothing.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.272
Mr. Griffin,
with all due respect,

13:27.274 --> 13:28.773
we live in two different worlds.

13:28.775 --> 13:32.043
I must do what is best
for my son... and I have.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.711
Hey, how do we know
what's gonna happen?

13:33.713 --> 13:35.780
For all we know,
Meg might want to Amish herself.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.049
I had not considered this.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.685
I was verily preoccupied
with Eli's corruption.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.754
Plus, it is the time
of the month

13:42.756 --> 13:44.589
when Eli's mother
is on the burlap.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.624
So whaddaya say,
let the kids give it a shot?

13:46.626 --> 13:48.660
Perhaps, Mr. Griffin.
Perhaps.

13:48.662 --> 13:49.828
Good.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.262
Now on another note,
I notice you don't have

13:51.264 --> 13:52.964
a damn lick of music
in this town.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.166
We do not believe in
such ostentations.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.503
Well, I am about
to change your mind.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.339
Introducing rock 'n' roll!

14:01.341 --> 14:02.707
♪ Whoo!

14:02.709 --> 14:07.712
♪ I'm on a highway
to hell! ♪

14:07.714 --> 14:10.548
♪ Highway to hell!

14:10.550 --> 14:11.816
♪ I'm on the high...

14:11.818 --> 14:14.352
You are banished from our
community at once!

14:14.354 --> 14:16.855
And take your whore
daughter with you!

14:19.825 --> 14:21.292
How did it go, Dad?

14:21.294 --> 14:22.627
Very well, Meg.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.629
My recollection is that
it went extremely well.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.498
Really?! Oh, my God, Dad,
that's fantastic!

14:27.500 --> 14:28.867
So I-I can see Eli again?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.435
EZEKIEL:
Griffins!

14:31.937 --> 14:34.305
(crowd clamoring)

14:34.307 --> 14:36.107
What's going on here?

14:36.109 --> 14:37.709
Your family must leave
our community

14:37.711 --> 14:40.011
and return to the outside world.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.179
Dad, what's happening?

14:41.181 --> 14:42.680
I thought you talked to him.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.617
Sir, please, whatever your
quarrel is with my husband,

14:45.619 --> 14:46.985
I'm sure it's
probably justified,

14:46.987 --> 14:50.488
but I'm begging you, don't
punish the children for it.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.823
They're innocent in all this.

14:51.825 --> 14:52.824
Innocent, are they?

14:52.826 --> 14:55.360
I found this
in Eli's corn hole!

14:55.362 --> 14:56.961
Well, I... His what?

14:56.963 --> 14:59.664
A compartment in Eli's room
where he stores his corn.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.866
Oh. Well, okay,
whatever you say.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.201
Look, Ezekiel, we would love

15:03.203 --> 15:04.602
to go back to the city,
believe me.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.471
I-I haven't
had a drink in three days.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.705
But our car broke down.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.941
We-we can't go anywhere
until it gets fixed.

15:09.943 --> 15:12.877
I have arranged
to have that taken care of.

15:17.049 --> 15:19.284
This ride's gonna be
so frustrating.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.919
I know.
These horses are

15:20.921 --> 15:23.087
so slow.
Sexy.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.722
Sexy.

15:27.493 --> 15:29.994
STEWIE:
Good-bye,
Abraham Lincoln people.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.332
(sobbing)

15:34.334 --> 15:35.433
I'm sorry, Meg.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.536
Eli was the best boy
I'll ever meet.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.838
And now I'll never
see him again.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.942
ELI:
Yes, you will, Meg.

15:43.944 --> 15:44.976
(gasps) Eli.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.778
Eli? What are you doing here?

15:46.780 --> 15:48.680
I could not let you
leave without me, Meg.

15:48.682 --> 15:49.948
I love you.

15:49.950 --> 15:53.051
I love you, too.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.487
Hey, Lois, watch me lay rubber
in front of these losers.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.755
Hyah!

16:00.659 --> 16:03.194
Yeah! Choke on that, nerds.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.635
Eli, I agree
that your father was being

16:10.637 --> 16:11.869
somewhat unreasonable,

16:11.871 --> 16:13.972
but I don't think
running away is the answer.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.974
I know, Mrs. Griffin.
And I am sorry.

16:15.976 --> 16:17.976
But I just could
not bear the thought

16:17.978 --> 16:19.510
of never seeing Meg again.

16:19.512 --> 16:21.279
You ever seen one
of these, Eli?

16:21.281 --> 16:22.847
It's a Coleco
football game.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.382
Pretty mind-
blowing, huh?

16:24.384 --> 16:25.616
You know what?

16:25.618 --> 16:27.785
This is garbage to us.

16:27.787 --> 16:28.920
(crowd clamoring)

16:28.922 --> 16:30.688
What the hell is that?

16:36.295 --> 16:38.196
Holy crap! Who did this?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.864
It must have been my father.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.799
This is how
the Amish declare a feud.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.368
But I thought they
were nonviolent.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.502
We are,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.005
but Peter must have
really pissed off my dad.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.439
Hey, who raked the leaves?

16:48.441 --> 16:49.774
And look,
somebody mowed the lawn.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.142
I was supposed to do that.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.311
Ha-ha! I have done your chores

16:53.313 --> 16:55.780
to rob you of the joy
of doing chores.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.081
You bastard.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.151
Peter, we don't have
a choice.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.919
We've gotta bring
Eli back.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.187
Oh, no, we don't.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.789
What are you talking about?

17:04.791 --> 17:06.858
We-we can't be part of a feud
with the Amish.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.526
I didn't start
this thing, Lois,

17:08.528 --> 17:10.995
but I'm gonna finish it.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.800
Joe, go round up Quagmire

17:15.802 --> 17:17.935
and all the modern-day
technology you can find.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.038
We are going to war.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.873
Oh. Oh, hey, Bonnie.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.775
Is Joe there?

17:23.777 --> 17:26.344
Well, can I leave
a message for him?

17:26.346 --> 17:30.381
Yeah, it's what I said before
about the-the war thing.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.594
(beeping)

17:49.802 --> 17:51.436
All right, men,
this is it.

17:51.438 --> 17:54.105
Technology versus
old-timey wooden stuff.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.540
Let's hit 'em hard.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.541
What, again, was
the nature

17:56.543 --> 17:57.942
of your beef
with them?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.310
I don't know.
Something about

17:59.312 --> 18:00.745
a roller coaster.
Let's go.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.591
Apples... fire!

18:17.162 --> 18:18.262
(all gasping, yelling)

18:18.264 --> 18:19.497
Ah! Damn it!
Ow! God!

18:19.499 --> 18:21.732
Quilters... advance!

18:27.439 --> 18:29.841
Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Oh!

18:29.843 --> 18:31.242
I bet this hurts so much!

18:32.544 --> 18:33.611
(screams)

18:33.613 --> 18:35.847
Ow! Damn it! I'm bleeding!

18:35.849 --> 18:37.582
Uhp, now it's an AIDS quilt.

18:39.985 --> 18:41.252
(gasps)

18:45.491 --> 18:47.992
Suck on this,
you furry little weirdoes!

19:13.018 --> 19:14.418
Enough of this crap.

19:15.187 --> 19:16.320
Ezekiel.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.793
Call off your boys and let's you
and me finish this man-to-man.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.696
Indeed.
Prepare for a goodly beating.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.666
(tires screech)

19:30.536 --> 19:32.470
Dad, stop.
Leave him alone.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.205
Father, what are you doing?

19:34.207 --> 19:35.773
I am going to
kill that man.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.808
That man
is my girlfriend, Meg.

19:37.810 --> 19:38.943
(Peter laughs)

19:38.945 --> 19:41.546
This is against everything
our people stand for.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.314
Will you listen to me
for one moment?

19:43.316 --> 19:46.217
You were so worried
about these outsiders

19:46.219 --> 19:48.519
coming into our community
and corrupting me.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.121
But look at yourself.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.757
You're the one who's allowed
yourself to be corrupted.

19:52.759 --> 19:56.027
God in heaven...

19:56.029 --> 19:57.595
you are right.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.097
I am deeply ashamed.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.500
I only wanted to protect you.

20:02.502 --> 20:03.834
I know you did, Father.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.771
PETER:
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

20:06.773 --> 20:10.541
(sighs)
Son, it is your life to live.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.010
I must accept
the life you choose.

20:16.148 --> 20:18.849
I choose to stay here.

20:18.851 --> 20:20.051
What?!
What?!

20:20.053 --> 20:22.954
Meg, you are the
most beautiful woman

20:22.956 --> 20:24.288
I will ever know.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.324
You have shown me
so many wondrous things

20:26.326 --> 20:29.694
that have opened my eyes
to the world beyond my home.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.530
But this is where I belong.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.165
I'm sorry
if this upsets you, Meg.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.767
(voice breaking):
I love you, Eli.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.169
I'll always love you.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.671
If this is what you
have to do,

20:40.673 --> 20:42.873
then all I can say is...

20:42.875 --> 20:45.042
I'll never forget you.

20:48.013 --> 20:51.816
(sighs)
I am sorry there has been
conflict between us.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.351
Allow me to make amends.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.854
Please help yourself
to anything in my corn hole.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.022
Hey, don't worry
about it.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.490
We can still be pals.

20:59.492 --> 21:01.592
And I know just
the place for us

21:01.594 --> 21:03.661
to go and blow off
all this steam.
