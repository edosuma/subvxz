WEBVTT

00:02.430 --> 00:05.433
[bell dings]

00:05.480 --> 00:08.040
It shouldn't be primarily
about pro bono.

00:08.090 --> 00:11.696
Look, I'm at Alicia's door.
I'll ask her.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.308
[knocking]

00:16.270 --> 00:17.180
Alicia Florrick?

00:17.230 --> 00:20.188
This is 603. She's in 903.

00:20.230 --> 00:22.755
Three floors up.
Oh.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.109
Sorry. [knocking]

00:28.280 --> 00:29.542
DUI.

00:29.590 --> 00:33.060
Wrong floor. Up. Three flights.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.326
[knocking]

00:35.640 --> 00:37.414
903.
You want 903.

00:37.470 --> 00:41.201
This is 603. See? 603.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.855
Six. That's three numbers
less than nine.

00:45.130 --> 00:46.939
[knocking]

00:47.000 --> 00:48.991
[sighs]

00:50.050 --> 00:52.177
Oh, hello.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.040
Do you work for Mrs. Florrick?

00:55.440 --> 00:57.613
No. Although sometimes
I feel like it.

00:57.660 --> 01:00.265
This is not her law firm.
This is my home.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.925
See how pretty it is?
They rearranged the panel

01:02.970 --> 01:05.882
on the elevator so the six
is below the nine.

01:05.930 --> 01:09.184
Could you please tell your
client friends to learn to read?

01:12.980 --> 01:14.459
Are you
here to see

01:14.500 --> 01:15.979
Alicia
Florrick?Yep.

01:16.030 --> 01:18.760
A music case.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.152
Is this her door?

01:21.210 --> 01:23.553
Yep.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.909
[knocking]

01:26.910 --> 01:28.866
Oh, good. It's you.

01:28.910 --> 01:31.731
Dear God, what is up
with that bitch downstairs?

01:31.780 --> 01:32.735
Rowby.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.600
Hey! I know, right?

01:34.650 --> 01:36.914
It's been centuries, huh?

01:36.960 --> 01:39.303
Look at you, working from home.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.260
You're like an artist now.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.834
You look great.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.006
I totally agree.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.482
I guess that's what happens

01:45.540 --> 01:46.791
when you start working
for yourself.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.353
I got a kid now.

01:48.410 --> 01:50.708
Little Josh.Congratulations.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.842
Thanks.
And, uh...

01:52.890 --> 01:55.973
I could use some legal help.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.804
Good morning, magic sunshine,
it's a brand-new day

02:03.860 --> 02:07.079
I see you peeking through
my curtains, come in and

02:07.120 --> 02:09.463
Stay, stay, go bananas...

02:09.520 --> 02:11.465
Mmm. Good song, Rowby.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.988
Thanks. It's my kid's
birthday par...

02:14.040 --> 02:15.905
Oh, that's him.
Little Josh.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.520
_ He's a_to_tal clown.
He lIkes to Imitate everyone.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.959
But then again I might

02:21.010 --> 02:25.049
Wake up and start my day
with magic sunshine...

02:25.100 --> 02:27.000
You're good, Rowby.

02:27.050 --> 02:28.449
I am good.

02:28.490 --> 02:29.445
So what's the problem?

02:29.490 --> 02:31.446
Oh. Um...

02:31.490 --> 02:34.880
I got this letter
from G.F.C Records.

02:36.930 --> 02:39.842
Yeah. Well, my
former label, yeah.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.199
They say the song's theirs?Yeah.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.196
That's the part I don't get.
I wrote it.

02:44.250 --> 02:45.763
I mean, I wrote that song.

02:45.810 --> 02:46.890
Ever since the whole
"Thicky Trick" thing,

02:46.940 --> 02:48.339
I keep track of stuff.

02:48.380 --> 02:50.553
Are you still under contract
with them?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.204
No, I finished that contract,
like, last year.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.854
So I don't understand.

02:53.910 --> 02:56.299
Have you recorded this song?No, I just
play it

02:56.350 --> 02:59.956
at kids' birthday parties,
but that video is online

03:00.000 --> 03:01.729
and it's gone viral.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.395
S-Small viral, but viral.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.044
[doorbell rings]I'll be right back.

03:08.790 --> 03:11.395
Mrs. Dosek.Mrs. Florrick.
I don't mean to be rude,

03:11.450 --> 03:13.577
but this is a residential
building, and you're conducting

03:13.620 --> 03:15.531
business here.Yes, I'll put a sign up
in the elevator,

03:15.580 --> 03:16.831
Mrs. Dosek.Okay, that's not
gonna make

03:16.890 --> 03:18.016
a difference. Here.

03:18.060 --> 03:19.186
Your daughter's report card.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.231
It's open.Yes.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.010
I thought it was addressed to
me. She got two 35 and three Cs.

03:24.070 --> 03:25.412
CARY: Hey. It's weird.
I went to the wrong floor.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.449
I think it's
the way they changed

03:26.510 --> 03:27.989
the numbers
in the elevator.

03:28.030 --> 03:29.986
I'll make it all good,
Mrs. Dosek.

03:30.030 --> 03:32.373
Thank you. Good-bye. Cary?

03:32.420 --> 03:34.559
So, am I late?Um...

03:34.600 --> 03:37.205
For?For Rowby.

03:37.260 --> 03:38.989
His new song.How did you know?

03:39.040 --> 03:40.348
He came by
Lockhart/Agos.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.869
I suggested it might be more
up your alley,

03:41.910 --> 03:43.161
but he wanted both of us.

03:43.220 --> 03:46.178
Cary, it's a kids' song.Yeah,

03:46.220 --> 03:47.949
with over a million views
on YouTube

03:48.010 --> 03:51.002
and with other labels
wanting to buy it.Oh.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.483
BEA:
Sorry I'm late.

03:52.530 --> 03:54.486
I just came
from a nasty encounter,

03:54.530 --> 03:56.054
so I might have some wine.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.795
That sounds good.
Uh, what encounter?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.273
Oh, just
some woman

03:59.320 --> 04:02.141
yelled at me.
So how's the job search going?

04:02.190 --> 04:04.932
It's good, actually. In
fact, I wanted to thank you

04:04.980 --> 04:05.969
for offering to advise,

04:06.020 --> 04:09.285
but I got a job.Really? Fantastic.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.935
Where?Uh, oddly, at the firm
I was complaining about.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.935
Lockhart/Agos/Lee.Huh.

04:13.990 --> 04:15.116
I just left there a month ago.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.377
Why'd you leave?

04:16.430 --> 04:18.034
Oh, the next
shiny thing.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.980
Alicia Florrick.
Now I'm not sure.

04:20.040 --> 04:21.769
That's where
I just got yelled at.

04:23.170 --> 04:25.126
Really?

04:25.170 --> 04:26.774
She said that?Yes.

04:26.830 --> 04:27.956
So she might come back?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.479
She didn't say that.
She just said

04:29.530 --> 04:30.827
she wasn't thrilled
to be going to

04:30.870 --> 04:31.950
_ a law firm
In someone's apartment.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.079
You have to
apologize.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.129
For what?

04:34.180 --> 04:35.568
For arguing a pro-life position.

04:35.620 --> 04:37.485
I wasn't arguing
a pro-life position.

04:37.530 --> 04:39.316
Diane, no one can understand
what you were doing.

04:39.360 --> 04:41.487
If saying "I'm sorry"
gets us back in the door

04:41.540 --> 04:43.360
of a $4—million-a-year client,
why wouldn't you?

04:43.410 --> 04:45.059
Because I'm not sorry.Do you want me to step out?

04:45.110 --> 04:46.839
No. Will she meet with us?Yes.

04:46.890 --> 04:48.585
I don't know. I
was speaking highly

04:48.630 --> 04:51.155
of you.
How diverse you are here.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.849
We should bring the cripple
to the next meeting.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.969
Oh, my God.What?

04:54.030 --> 04:54.985
The lawyer
in the wheelchair.

04:55.030 --> 04:55.985
I know what
you're saying.

04:56.030 --> 04:57.850
Will you call her?

04:57.900 --> 05:00.073
It's not really my account.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.679
Get her back in the door,
and we'll talk.

05:07.300 --> 05:10.827
Well, look who's here
to survey the spoils.

05:10.870 --> 05:12.474
Just seeing how you're doing.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.862
Our polling was off.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.909
I know.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.484
Way off.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.043
Was that you, too?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.261
No.I really thought
we were gonna

05:20.320 --> 05:22.049
go on to New Hampshire.I know.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.533
Peter did, too.

05:23.580 --> 05:25.309
But you didn't?You had me tempted.

05:25.360 --> 05:27.578
Your optimism was infectious.

05:28.930 --> 05:30.329
Well...

05:30.370 --> 05:32.452
You going on to Sanders?No.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.968
Congressional races.
They're more fun.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.545
You staying?Yeah. Peter's got to get
back into governing.

05:38.590 --> 05:40.979
Well, I have some advice
for you, if you don't mind.

05:41.030 --> 05:43.078
I'd never mind.Peter's in trouble.

05:43.120 --> 05:46.294
I don't know from where,
I don't know who.

05:46.340 --> 05:49.776
But a governor who returns home
after a loss

05:49.820 --> 05:52.209
has a target on his back.

05:52.260 --> 05:54.649
Someone's gonna take a shot
at him.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.952
Who?I don't know.

05:58.270 --> 05:59.692
Watch out for friends.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.131
And on that sinister note,

06:03.180 --> 06:04.875
good-bye, Eli.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.534
Good-bye, Ruth.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.879
Iwish...

06:10.930 --> 06:13.273
I had been better to you.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.668
I wish you had been, too.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.878
ROWBY:
Who are you?

06:43.920 --> 06:46.229
Uh, Lucca Quinn.
I work with Alicia.

06:46.270 --> 06:48.226
Doing what?

06:48.270 --> 06:50.090
Lawyering.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.448
Are you Rowby?

06:51.490 --> 06:53.446
Yeah.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.274
I have to tell
you something.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.759
I think I love you.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.279
[laughs]No, I'm not kidding.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.719
Like, I'm serious.
Like, I... it's crazy.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.374
Do you always
decide things this fast?

07:04.420 --> 07:05.808
Uh... yeah.

07:05.860 --> 07:09.637
Hey, can... can I play
some music for you?

07:09.690 --> 07:11.817
'Cause I think that's
the only chance I got.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.111
I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:13.170 --> 07:14.330
We're about to start
negotiations.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.812
Oh.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.906
You want to sit down?

07:17.950 --> 07:20.339
Oh! Yeah.

07:20.390 --> 07:22.824
Um... seriously, though,
can I just say

07:22.870 --> 07:25.259
that, like, I...
I never do this.

07:25.310 --> 07:29.781
But you... are the most
beautiful human being

07:29.840 --> 07:32.138
I have ever seen,
like, in my life.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.260
Thank you.It's crazy.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.662
I think we have company.

07:35.710 --> 07:37.837
Oh, hello.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.539
We're back facing each other.

07:39.580 --> 07:41.275
Andrea Stevens.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.969
And you have
some beautiful name, don't you?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.362
Lucca Quinn.
Lucca.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.024
[laughing]:
Yes.

07:47.070 --> 07:48.765
And you've done something
different with your hair,

07:48.810 --> 07:50.061
haven't you?
No.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.462
Yes. Yes, in the
front, the bangs.

07:51.510 --> 07:52.670
I love it.

07:52.730 --> 07:54.152
Should I just give
you guys some space?

07:54.210 --> 07:55.984
[laughs]

07:56.040 --> 07:57.940
Rowby Canton, always fun
to hear from the artist.

07:57.990 --> 08:00.038
I'm just gonna set myself up
right over here, all right?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.388
Okay.

08:01.430 --> 08:03.079
Good morning, everyone.

08:03.130 --> 08:05.473
Um, I just want to say
that my client, Damon,

08:05.520 --> 08:07.693
has great respect
for your talent, Rowby.

08:07.740 --> 08:08.911
Is that why he cut me loose?

08:08.960 --> 08:09.949
I cut you loose because...

08:10.010 --> 08:11.307
I don't think we need

08:11.360 --> 08:12.782
to go over the gory details.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.262
We respect you, Rowby,

08:14.310 --> 08:15.925
and that's why
we sent you

08:15.970 --> 08:17.392
a cease and
de5ist letter.

08:17.450 --> 08:19.315
Your YouTube video
must come down,

08:19.360 --> 08:22.409
and we ask that
you no longer record the song

08:22.450 --> 08:23.929
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine"

08:23.980 --> 08:25.231
until you acquire
our permission.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.899
Our client appreciates
all your respect, Andrea,

08:29.940 --> 08:32.898
um, but we respectfully reject
your cease and desist.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.988
Our client is the sole owner
of the song he composed.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.588
ANDREA:
Unfortunately,
that isn't true.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.074
As you can see
from this contract,

08:39.120 --> 08:41.907
Rowby owes us
another album.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.292
But I signed a two-album deal,

08:43.340 --> 08:45.069
and I gave you two albums.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.381
I rejected the second one.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.569
Damon.
One sec.

08:48.610 --> 08:51.522
Mr. Stryk wants our
artists to be happy,

08:51.570 --> 08:55.222
so he'll offer,
uh... $1,500

08:55.270 --> 08:57.431
for Rowby to record
a studio version.

08:57.490 --> 08:59.572
Uaughs
$1,500“;

08:59.620 --> 09:01.133
Seriously?Seriously.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.226
Oh, I would rather keep
playing birthday parties.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.929
ANDREA:
And you know what?
You're very good.

09:04.970 --> 09:06.312
I have a daughter
of my own.

09:06.370 --> 09:08.053
Adopted from China last year.

09:08.110 --> 09:09.884
And she loves it.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.931
But, again, it's our song.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.232
And we have to
warn you, Rowby,

09:14.290 --> 09:16.929
that, um, we'll be pulling
your video off-line.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.241
No, you won't.
You can't do that.

09:18.290 --> 09:19.939
Mm-hmm.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.594
Yeah, actually,
I just did.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.904
Can she do that?If we assert
a copyright interest,

09:23.950 --> 09:25.679
we can unilaterally
remove

09:25.730 --> 09:26.685
infringing videos.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.344
You can't_ assert
a copyright...

DIANE:
Thank you, Bea,

09:31.090 --> 09:32.648
for giving us a second chance.

09:32.700 --> 09:33.997
I don't know if
that's what I'm doing.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.439
But I am here to listen.David Lee.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.653
I hope you remember me.
I'm a real fan of yours.

09:38.700 --> 09:39.962
I told Diane
and David

09:40.010 --> 09:41.614
that you might be having
some difficulty

09:41.660 --> 09:44.220
with the lack of infrastructure
at Florrick/Qumn.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.703
Yes.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.706
But I'm not sure if
I'm ready to come back here.

09:47.760 --> 09:49.273
Well, we would love
to tell you...

09:49.320 --> 09:51.629
[muffled arguing]

09:51.670 --> 09:54.366
BEA:
"How"?
Yes, why don't you come

09:54.410 --> 09:55.934
into Diane's office,
and we can talk?Yes, good idea.

09:55.980 --> 09:57.459
BEA:
I have a call to make first.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.377
DAVID:
In the office!
Just... just right here.

09:59.420 --> 10:00.637
...happy with that.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.853
[all talking over each other]

10:04.420 --> 10:06.809
What's wrong?What are they doing here?

10:06.860 --> 10:09.590
G.F.C Records?No, Alicia and her partner.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.685
I told you.
We're on this case together.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.991
Are you trying
to sabotage us?

10:12.040 --> 10:13.291
Not in our
conference room, Cary.

10:13.350 --> 10:15.033
We have Bea Wilson here.

10:15.090 --> 10:17.081
She's thinking
of leaving them.I didn't know that.

10:17.130 --> 10:19.598
Well, get them out of here.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.821
ANDREA:
All right, all right!
Excuse me.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.654
Thank you for your attention,
everyone. Damon?

10:23.710 --> 10:26.656
Look, we really wanted
to settle this here,

10:26.710 --> 10:27.961
but you've given us no choice.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.183
We are suing your client.For what?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.095
Breach of_contract.
$3.1 million in damages.

10:32.150 --> 10:33.879
Three point what?

10:33.930 --> 10:34.885
Look at your contract, buddy.

10:34.930 --> 10:37.490
What part of my contract?

10:37.540 --> 10:38.802
It's their costs.

10:38.850 --> 10:40.841
ROWBY [laughing]:
Costs? Oh, oh, it's

10:40.900 --> 10:42.288
$3.1 million in costs?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.505
They didn't promote my album.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.461
...CD packaging and breakage.

10:47.510 --> 10:49.205
Almost everything was online.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.036
I mean, I don't...
I don't... I don't remember

10:51.080 --> 10:52.206
negotiating any of this stuff.

10:52.260 --> 10:53.511
You probably didn't.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.811
It's all pretty boiler-plate.

10:54.870 --> 10:56.826
It's designed to
maximize their profits,

10:56.870 --> 10:58.770
keep their artists indebted.Well, it's working.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.993
Now what? I mean, I-I can't
afford $3.1 million.

11:02.050 --> 11:03.779
It's ridiculous.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.138
Can you guys represent me?

11:07.440 --> 11:10.182
Well, we would have to talk
about our fee.[doorbell rings]

11:10.230 --> 11:11.788
Well, what if... what if
I just paid you back

11:11.840 --> 11:12.920
with a percentage of the song?

11:12.970 --> 11:14.528
If you get it back.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.229
"If"?

11:17.630 --> 11:19.359
It's not about us.

11:19.410 --> 11:21.014
It's about work.

11:21.070 --> 11:24.369
I'm working as the chief
of staff for Peter now--

11:24.420 --> 11:27.321
again-- and I wanted

11:27.380 --> 11:30.076
to talk to you about the future.

_ _Potential
political problems.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.269
Oh. Hi, Mrs. Dosek.
How are you?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.402
Fine. Can you give this
to your mother?

11:56.450 --> 11:58.441
Oh. Uh, yes.
What is it?

11:58.500 --> 11:59.979
It's from _ _
the homeowners' assoaation.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.578
It's an eviction notice.

12:01.630 --> 12:04.758
Excuse me?_
Your mother is
running a busmess

12:04.810 --> 12:06.892
out of her home.No, she isn't.

12:06.940 --> 12:08.840
ROWBY:
You know, just tell...
you tell them

12:08.900 --> 12:10.379
that I'll see 'em in court.

12:10.420 --> 12:11.762
Excuse me.

12:13.420 --> 12:15.115
That's just a friend
of the family.

12:15.160 --> 12:16.764
Your mother has
one week

12:16.820 --> 12:19.948
to respond before we commence
eviction proceedings.

12:38.010 --> 12:40.183
I like this office.
Why are you leaving it?

12:40.230 --> 12:42.960
Come on, I need the chair.No, I think you
should stay here.

12:43.020 --> 12:44.976
It keeps you humble.Come on, I don't
have time to play.

12:45.020 --> 12:47.488
Wow, you're sour.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.280
[sighs]

12:50.630 --> 12:52.632
See? It's so impersonal in here.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.285
If you want the small
office, you can take it.

12:55.330 --> 12:56.888
Really?
Uh-huh.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.020
Really? I should take
the small office?

12:59.080 --> 13:00.809
I can have the job?What job?

13:00.860 --> 13:03.385
The job you're offering me.I am not offering you a job.

13:03.430 --> 13:05.330
There is no job.
Can you see I'm busy?

13:05.390 --> 13:08.120
Dad, I need a job.
I need to finance my art.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.343
What art?The art of living.
Come on.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.824
ELI:
I can't help you.
Ask someone else.

13:12.870 --> 13:14.952
Ask Alicia.

13:15.010 --> 13:17.570
Yeah, Alicia.
She probably needs someone.

13:17.620 --> 13:20.316
Her firm just took on
a lot of clients.
Huh.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.839
It's not a bad idea.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.404
Odd.

13:23.450 --> 13:24.963
You know, you're
not as fun

13:25.020 --> 13:27.238
as you used to be, Dad--
something's off with you.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.975
It's called fatherhood.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.976
DAMON:
The fact of the matter is

13:31.020 --> 13:32.624
that Rowby Canton isn't

13:32.680 --> 13:33.840
a freedom fighter.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.845
He's a man under contract

13:35.900 --> 13:37.413
who wishes he weren't.But Mr. Canton says

13:37.460 --> 13:39.155
he delivered you
a second album-- didn't he?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.758
DAMON:
Yes, but what
he delivered

13:40.820 --> 13:42.947
was... unacceptable.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.776
Can I say something?
Because that is r...

13:44.820 --> 13:46.208
really offensive.JUDGE PAGE:
No.

Unfortunately not, Mr. Canton.

_ ROWBY: _ _
P0int of personal prIVIlege.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.165
Yes. I'm guessing that you saw
that in a movie, sir.

That doesn't work here.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.695
Please continue.Thank you,
Your Honor.

13:55.740 --> 13:57.219
Mr. Stryk.There were no
crowd-pleasers,

13:57.270 --> 13:58.783
there were no hooks,

13:58.830 --> 13:59.876
there was nothing
I could even repackage

13:59.920 --> 14:01.433
to any other artist.

I already reposted it.

How did you do that?

14:04.710 --> 14:07.053
I thought they
had it excluded.Mirror-reversed it.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.056
The classic way to get around
their detection software.

14:09.100 --> 14:10.977
How long before you think
they figure it out?

14:11.020 --> 14:12.146

I have produced

14:12.190 --> 14:13.930
over 200 of them.

14:13.980 --> 14:17.893
And what Mr. Canton handed me
was... not a hit.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.158
ANDREA: Your Honor, I know it's
hard for artists like Rowby,

14:20.200 --> 14:23.249
who tend to work from an
emotional place, to understand

14:23.290 --> 14:25.758
all the ins and outs...Objection, Your Honor.

14:25.820 --> 14:27.981
Counsel is testifying.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.598
No, I'm just trying
to be compassionate, but...

14:29.650 --> 14:31.072
I'll hold my tongue.

14:31.130 --> 14:33.075
[softly]: I seem to have touched
on a sensitive area.

14:33.130 --> 14:35.564
Mr. Stryk... [sighs]

14:35.610 --> 14:37.919
you keep talking
about hit records,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.518
but Rowby wasn't
contractually obligated

14:39.570 --> 14:41.049
to deliver a hit album.

14:41.090 --> 14:43.308
That's true.He was obligated
to deliver an album

14:43.360 --> 14:45.134
that was_ _
"substantially Similar

14:45.180 --> 14:47.705
in quality and genre
to artist's initial album."

14:47.750 --> 14:49.058
Is that true, too?

14:49.100 --> 14:51.148
It is.
No further questions,
Your Honor.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.407
Ms. Stevens, anything?Yes.

14:52.450 --> 14:53.792
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.979
Was Mr. Canton's
second album

14:56.020 --> 14:59.103
"substantially similar in
quality and genre" to his first?

14:59.150 --> 15:01.801
No, it was not.
Why not?

15:01.850 --> 15:05.502
Because his first album
wasn't substantially bad.

Prejudicial.

In the building?

15:51.730 --> 15:53.243
Yeah, I think so. Why?

15:53.300 --> 15:54.688
You should check.

15:54.730 --> 15:56.288
All these homeowners'
assoaation people think

15:56.340 --> 15:57.557
they're above the law.

Usually they're just as corrupt.

How do I check?Sit down in the lobby.

Wait for a UPS man
or a FedEx man to come,

Okay. Will you keep me
in mind if things change?

Sure, but I don't
think they will.

visit me because you want to,
not because your dad

17:07.500 --> 17:10.321

of Musicology at Ridgeton.

17:25.130 --> 17:27.940
Doctor, what is pop music?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.513
A genre of popular music

17:29.570 --> 17:31.299
based in rock and roll
of the '505 and '605.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.738
And how would you recognize
a pop song?

17:32.790 --> 17:33.825
Through its hooks.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.394
Pop songs are all
full of hooks.

17:35.440 --> 17:36.611
There's one in the intro,

17:36.660 --> 17:37.957
another in the chorus,

17:38.010 --> 17:39.170
there's another in the bridge.

17:39.230 --> 17:40.913
And what do you mean by "hook"?

17:40.970 --> 17:42.619
It's a short, catchy,
repeated riff.

17:42.670 --> 17:44.274
It's an earworm.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.185
ANDREA: And that's all
there is to it? The hooks?

17:46.230 --> 17:49.051
No, uh, pop songs also tend
to be nonharmonic

17:49.110 --> 17:51.010
with pronounced
timbral dissonance.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.755
Four-bar phrasing, a
beat-per-minute range

17:53.810 --> 17:56.370
between 72 and 85.

17:56.420 --> 17:57.933
ANDREA: _
So you're saying
that Rowby Canton's

17:57.980 --> 18:01.370
new album didn't have
most of these hallmarks?

18:01.420 --> 18:03.502
I'm saying it had none of them.
Listen.

18:03.560 --> 18:07.815
I saw a light
I'd never seen before...

18:07.860 --> 18:09.646
ANDREA: _
Yes, yes, you're right.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.214
It's-it's not as catchy, is it?

18:11.260 --> 18:13.296
I keep trying
to tap my foot, but...

18:13.350 --> 18:15.739
This was not
substantially similar

18:15.790 --> 18:18.475
to his first album.Thank you. No further questions.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.919
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

18:20.960 --> 18:23.042
The song by Queen.
You're familiar with it?

18:23.100 --> 18:25.227
Of course.And you call that good?

18:25.270 --> 18:26.874
Right? A pop hit?

18:26.930 --> 18:28.227
Well...

18:28.280 --> 18:29.486
I would.
Well, yeah,

18:29.540 --> 18:31.269
it-it is.
It's a pop hit.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.844
Could you point out
where the hooks are?

18:32.890 --> 18:35.620
Well, you know,
not all pop songs are identical.

18:35.670 --> 18:37.410
Oh. Well, can I read back

18:37.460 --> 18:39.325
your testimony
from a few minutes ago?

18:39.370 --> 18:42.282
"Pop songs are
all full of hooks."

18:42.330 --> 18:44.116
Oh, Lucca, I love you.[gavel slams]

18:44.160 --> 18:46.469
LUCCA:
Would you like to correct
your testimony, sir?

18:46.510 --> 18:50.332
Not allpop songs are identical.
Most are identical.

18:50.390 --> 18:52.255
Yeah...
Uh, sorry.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.904
I-I don't think
we caught that.

18:53.950 --> 18:55.554
Right into your
microphone there.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.430
Yes, not all pop songs.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.471
And could you tell us where
the four-bar phrases are

18:59.520 --> 19:00.953
and the chorus
and the verse?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.399
WEINER: Well, that's
difficult to distinguish.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.782
LUCCA: And the 72 to 85
beats-per-minute range--

19:03.830 --> 19:05.616
where's that?Yeah, but again,

19:05.660 --> 19:07.742
"Bohemian Rhapsody"
is an unusual case.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.838
As is Rowby's song. Thank you.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.609
ANDREA:
Mm. That last little bit

19:11.670 --> 19:13.092
wasn't really a question,
was it?

19:13.150 --> 19:15.015
Yeah, let me see
ifI can confine

19:15.060 --> 19:16.880
my redirect
to questions.

19:16.930 --> 19:18.454
Mr. Canton's contract said

19:18.500 --> 19:21.367
"substantially similar
in quality and genre."

19:21.420 --> 19:22.899
What genre was his first album?

19:22.940 --> 19:25.408
As I've said, it was pop.And...

19:25.460 --> 19:28.065
what is... this?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.076
I saw the light...

19:30.120 --> 19:32.293
It-it's not pop.Thank you.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.649
And I love
"Bohemian Rhapsody," too.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.818
I couldn't stare...

19:37.870 --> 19:39.087
Kermit Corriel.

19:39.130 --> 19:40.904
I taught music at Juilliard.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.565
_ You also have a doctorate
in mu5icology from lehard?

19:43.610 --> 19:45.919
Well, yeah, but who goes around
advertising that?

19:45.960 --> 19:47.439
This guy is awesome.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.264
CARY:
Would you agree
that Rowby's second album

19:49.310 --> 19:50.709
is not in the same pop genre
as his first album?

19:50.750 --> 19:53.310
I don't think I'd agree
with any part of that.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.487
His first album wasn't
exactly 100% pop.

19:55.540 --> 19:56.666
And I don't think his second
album's all that different.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.496
Can you explain?

19:58.540 --> 20:00.451
Well, yeah, I mean,
genres aren't fixed, right?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.274
They ebb and flow over time.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.106
And then there's this give
and take between genres.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.673
Like, Rowby's first album
was pop,

20:06.720 --> 20:09.894
but it also had country
and folk tendencies, too.

20:09.940 --> 20:11.589
And his second album?Well, that pushes
deeper into country.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.153
You can hear that
in the intro.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.507
And then it pushes
further into folk

20:14.560 --> 20:16.118
with the verse,
and then in the chorus,

20:16.170 --> 20:17.819
I mean, look, it's pretty clear
that it's indie pop.

20:17.860 --> 20:20.863
So, is this the same or
different than "Thicky Trick"?

20:20.910 --> 20:22.901
I don't know...
it-it-it's both, man.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.257
Rowby's an artist.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.607
He's exploring.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.299
Both those songs are written
by the same person,

20:27.350 --> 20:28.521
but they're not identical.

20:28.570 --> 20:30.344
And no album
should be identical.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.436
Like Picasso, right?
You see him going through

20:32.490 --> 20:34.833
his Blue Period or
his Crystal Period.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.701
Thank you.
PAGE:
Okay, this is all fascinating,

20:37.750 --> 20:39.923
but there's nothing
that I've heard

20:39.970 --> 20:42.495
that convinces me
that there's anything close

20:42.540 --> 20:44.588
to objective truth here,
so I have to defer

20:44.630 --> 20:46.188
to the good faith efforts

20:46.240 --> 20:50.108
made by Mr. Canton
to fulfill his contract.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.321
Yes, Your Honor, you...

20:52.380 --> 20:53.722
are awesome, thank you.

20:53.770 --> 20:55.283
Your Honor, uh,
we seek lead to argue

20:55.340 --> 20:56.637
that the song
was written

20:56.690 --> 20:58.555
during the term of his contract.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.680
What?

20:59.730 --> 21:01.209
You do?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.774
Then why did we go through
this exercise?

21:03.820 --> 21:05.378
I'm so sorry,
Your Honor,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.250
but this was just brought
to our attention.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.780
This is another video
that Mr. Canton

21:09.830 --> 21:11.957
posted online.

21:14.220 --> 21:16.529
Good morning, magic sunshine

21:16.570 --> 21:19.573
It's a brand-new day...

21:19.620 --> 21:21.349
PAGE:
Very nice.

21:21.410 --> 21:22.399
What am I looking for?

21:22.450 --> 21:24.179
The time code stamp.

21:24.230 --> 21:26.539
ChummyVideo stamps
the posting time of all videos.

21:26.580 --> 21:29.458
See, this video
was posted at 11:42 pm.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.286
on November 30.

21:31.330 --> 21:34.413
Rowby Canton's contract
didn't expire

21:34.460 --> 21:36.508
until midnight
on that date, Your Honor.

21:36.550 --> 21:40.281
Therefore, he wrote the song
while still under contract.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.422
Wake up and start my day
with magic sunsh...

21:52.480 --> 21:54.562
What's going on
with you and Alicia?Nothing.

21:54.610 --> 21:57.135
Can we not do this now?No, we're doing this now, Dad.

21:57.180 --> 21:59.353
You got Mom pregnant,
so we're doing this now.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.174
What did Alicia say?She said,

22:01.230 --> 22:03.266
"Tell Eli
to stop it."Stop what?

22:03.320 --> 22:04.799
That's what I asked.
She didn't say.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.092
She made it sound like
she didn't have to say.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.585
Alicia and I are
haVIng some... issues.

22:16.630 --> 22:18.188
Are you sleeping with her?

22:18.240 --> 22:20.242
Oh, my God, no!

22:20.290 --> 22:21.416
No.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.801
Are you
wanting to?

22:22.860 --> 22:24.282
What? No.

22:24.340 --> 22:26.808
It's nothing like that.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.293
Then what is it?

22:30.390 --> 22:31.903
Uh...

22:31.950 --> 22:34.384
Six years ago,
Alicia got a voice mail

22:34.440 --> 22:37.000
from... a friend,

22:37.050 --> 22:39.302
someone who was
in love With her.

22:39.350 --> 22:42.228
Will?Yes. How do you know that?

22:42.270 --> 22:44.044
I have eyes.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.783
And he said that he loved her,

22:45.840 --> 22:49.571
and I was worried _about Alicia
getting this v0ice mail

22:49.620 --> 22:52.316
in the middle
of a campaign, so...

22:52.370 --> 22:54.361
I erased it.

22:57.330 --> 23:00.413
And I felt bad about it,
and so I told her.

23:00.460 --> 23:01.939
VVhen?

23:01.980 --> 23:04.028
A week ago.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.628
And that's it.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.332
So he called her and said,
"I love you," and you erased it?

23:10.380 --> 23:12.029
And now Will's gone,
and it's something

23:12.080 --> 23:13.422
she can never make right.

23:13.470 --> 23:15.426
Yes.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.209
I'm not proud of it.

23:17.260 --> 23:20.047
That's why I told her.

23:20.090 --> 23:23.139
God, it's like a soap opera here
when I'm gone.

23:23.180 --> 23:25.045
And now she's gonna
think I'm trying to get back

23:25.090 --> 23:26.569
into her good graces
by sending you over there.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.349
She won't
talk to you?No.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.356
You think that'll change?No.

23:30.400 --> 23:31.742
Have you tried...Yes, yes.

23:31.800 --> 23:33.358
Everything.

23:36.450 --> 23:38.008
What are you doing?

23:38.060 --> 23:39.971
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.237
Just-just don't
do anything, okay?

23:41.280 --> 23:43.589
This is my thing.All right. Bye.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.588
You're gonna do something,
aren't you? Marissa.[door closes]

ALICIA:
Andrea Stevens

23:48.510 --> 23:50.205
has subpoenaed
your computer

23:50.250 --> 23:51.501
and your phone,
so we need to know:

23:51.560 --> 23:53.596
Did you write
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine"

23:53.640 --> 23:56.518
while you were
under contract for G.F.C?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.812
No.ChummyVideo time-stamps

23:58.870 --> 24:01.566
every posting, and we've
confirmed you posted the song

24:01.610 --> 24:04.170
at 11:42 pm. on the 30th,

24:04.220 --> 24:06.609
which means the contract
was still valid.LUCCA: Wait.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.560
Where is ChummyVideo centered?

24:08.620 --> 24:10.224
What do you mean?Well, it's California,

24:10.270 --> 24:12.397
right?
It's a California company.

24:12.450 --> 24:13.747
That's right.
That's right.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.485
Lucca, that's-that's
totally right!

24:16.540 --> 24:18.144
Are you saying the time zone
made a difference?

24:18.190 --> 24:19.748
Yes, I posted the video

24:19.800 --> 24:21.495
at 11:42 pm.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.407
Pacific time, which means...

24:24.460 --> 24:26.849
1:42 am. Chicago time.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.970
Yeah, which means
the contract's expired.

24:29.030 --> 24:31.464
Yeah, but you wrote the song
in that short of a time?Yes, that's how

24:31.510 --> 24:33.728
all of my songs come.
Trust me when I say

24:33.770 --> 24:35.465
I know when
the damn contract ended.

24:35.510 --> 24:38.980
And the minute the clock
struck midnight, I celebrated.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.769
I had people over to my house.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.469
Unfortunately, I woke up my son,

24:42.520 --> 24:44.772
and I tried to get him
to go back to sleep,

24:44.830 --> 24:47.298
and when it didn't work, I wrote
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine."

24:47.350 --> 24:49.477
You improvised it on video?

24:49.530 --> 24:50.872
Yeah, it's pretty
cool, right?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.524
I keep telling
you guys, it's just

24:52.570 --> 24:53.912
a song I wrote for my kid.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.750
I would really like
to buy you a drink.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.313
Why?

25:04.370 --> 25:06.326
Because YOU are awesome.

25:06.370 --> 25:08.326
How long have you
been married, Rowby?

25:08.370 --> 25:09.541
I've never been married.

25:09.590 --> 25:12.104
I wrote you a song.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.549
So who was holding
the camera?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.545
What camera?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.556
When you were playing
for your son?

25:18.600 --> 25:20.852
You were playing the guitar,
your son was in bed,

25:20.910 --> 25:22.559
and_ someone was
holding the camera.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.682
Who was that?

25:26.130 --> 25:27.643
We're divorced.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.601
She wanted
a two-car garage,

25:30.650 --> 25:33.824
and... _I couldn't
give it to her.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.833
True story.

25:45.540 --> 25:48.100
[chuckling]:
You're like a Bond girl.

25:48.150 --> 25:52.883
I like artists,

25:52.940 --> 25:57.411
but I lose interest
in them real quick.

25:57.460 --> 25:59.155
You want to go home?

26:00.680 --> 26:02.591
Sure. I have a babysitter.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.074
Is your home an artist's hovel?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.645
Yes, but tomorrow's
cleaning day.

26:08.690 --> 26:10.646
My apartment.

26:10.690 --> 26:12.646
Just for an hour.

26:12.700 --> 26:13.917
Then you'll go home.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.302
I promise.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.608
It wasjust, like... boom!

26:19.660 --> 26:22.652
It wasn't there, and then all
of a sudden, it was there.

26:22.710 --> 26:26.578
It was, uh, like, this-this,
um, like, creative orgasm.

26:26.620 --> 26:28.838
ALICIA: Like a burst
of creativity.

26:28.890 --> 26:31.620
Yes, like a... yes.

26:31.670 --> 26:33.626
And I just,
I sat there,

26:33.670 --> 26:34.887
and I just
watched the clock

26:34.940 --> 26:37.363
until my contract
expired,

26:37.420 --> 26:39.581
and then I was like, bang, bang,
bang, bang, bang, bang.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.507
And I wrote, like, eight songs,
one after another, like, boom.

26:42.550 --> 26:45.508
ALICIA: And is that common
to be able to generate

26:45.560 --> 26:48.245
a good, quality song in such
a short amount of time?

26:48.300 --> 26:51.076
The song "Yesterday," McCartney
woke up with that in his head.

26:51.130 --> 26:53.473
Thank you.Mr. Canton,
do you mind ifI ask,

26:53.520 --> 26:54.691
how long did it
take you to write

26:54.740 --> 26:56.514
the eight songs
for your second album?

26:56.570 --> 26:59.528
I don't know. Years?ANDREA: Two years, actually.

26:59.570 --> 27:02.562
So it took two years
for eight songs,

27:02.620 --> 27:05.043
and then, let's see,
two hours for the next eight?

27:05.100 --> 27:06.829
I was just under
a lot of pressure

27:06.880 --> 27:08.836
to write the first eight songs.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.019
My goodness, that must be
quite a bit of pressure for you.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.528
Objection, Your Honor.I withdraw that.
It's not a big point.

27:13.580 --> 27:16.492
So can you help
me understand

27:16.540 --> 27:18.496
this note you left on your
subpoenaed smartphone?

27:18.540 --> 27:21.498
It's a lyric from
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine."

27:21.550 --> 27:23.677
It says,
"Make me warm and toasty

27:23.720 --> 27:26.188
while I lay here warm and cozy,"

27:26.250 --> 27:29.378
and it's dated 23 days before
the end of your record contract.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.591
ROWBY: Uh, I wrote that down,
but that's not a lyric.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.639
ANDREA: _ _
I'm pretty sure it is.

27:32.690 --> 27:34.510
No, it ended
up as a lyric.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.993
It's just, it's something
that my son said.

27:36.040 --> 27:39.089
Like, he said something
totally cute and awesome,

27:39.130 --> 27:40.825
and I wrote it down.

27:40.870 --> 27:43.259
Which, according to the terms
of your deal with G.F.C Records,

27:43.310 --> 27:44.561
constitutes work product

27:44.610 --> 27:47.397
created within the term
of your contract.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.044
You're claiming that you own
the copyright to that line?

27:49.100 --> 27:51.614
Absolutely.
Uh, that's absurd
on its face.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.706
They don't own
everything his kid says

27:53.750 --> 27:55.706
just because he wrote it down.I didn't say "everything."

27:55.760 --> 27:57.239
Well, that's...Are you seriously...?

27:57.280 --> 27:58.975
I mean, his son...
his son...

27:59.020 --> 28:00.715
His son, Your Honor,

28:00.760 --> 28:03.979
his son, Josh's quote
was not work product.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.543
Your Honor, it was inspiration.

28:05.590 --> 28:07.546
"Inspiration"
isn't a legal term.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.148
It's an artistic conceit.

28:09.200 --> 28:10.986
Because Rowby is an artist.An artist under contract.

28:11.030 --> 28:13.498
But Rowby's contract does not
negate the creative process.

28:13.560 --> 28:15.721
He wrote something down
that was meaningful to him,

28:15.780 --> 28:17.941
not knowing it would
make its way into a song.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.774
But it did, quite directly.

28:19.820 --> 28:22.163
Josh's quote was the first step
in a songwriting process

28:22.220 --> 28:25.951
that Mr. Canton began while
still under a deal with G.F.C.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.082
ALICIA: Think about
what she's saying, Your Honor.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.132
A.A. Milne based
Christopher Robin on his son,

28:31.180 --> 28:33.648
but that doesn't mean he started
writing Winnie-the-Pooh

28:33.710 --> 28:35.439
the day he became a father.

28:35.490 --> 28:37.742
Bob Dylan didn't start writing
"Tangled Up in Blue"

28:37.800 --> 28:40.530
on the day of his marriage even
though that's what it's about.

28:40.580 --> 28:43.754
Those were general inspirations;
this is a specific line.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.758
No, it became a specific line.Moreover, the existence
of this note undercuts

28:46.810 --> 28:48.323
Mr. Canton's claim that he wrote

28:48.370 --> 28:50.247
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine"
in less than a day.

28:50.290 --> 28:53.111
The act of observing the world
is not the same as composing.

28:53.160 --> 28:54.889
Enough, please.

28:54.950 --> 28:58.989
Um, your cynicism is,
I'm sure, warranted,

28:59.040 --> 29:00.769
given your business,
Miss Stevens,

29:00.820 --> 29:03.129
but I-I must agree
with the defendant here.

29:03.170 --> 29:06.298
Observing the world is not
the same as composing.

29:06.350 --> 29:10.263
I don't think any of us want to
slide down that slippery slope.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.266
[gavel slams]Case dismissed.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.832
Did we... did
we just win?

29:15.880 --> 29:18.098
You won.We won?! Yes.

29:18.140 --> 29:19.698
We did it.

29:23.710 --> 29:26.235
DOSEK: And I'm constantly
signing for her packages,

29:26.280 --> 29:27.929
and not for her personally;
for her business.

29:27.980 --> 29:29.675
I-I'm sorry,
but I understood

29:29.720 --> 29:31.369
that Mrs. Florrick would_be
present for today's meeting.

29:31.420 --> 29:32.671
Uh, Mrs. Florrick is otherwise
disposed at the moment,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.859
but as an employee
of Florrick/Quinn,

29:34.900 --> 29:37.368
_ _I can answer
any questions you might have.Aren't you her daughter?

29:37.420 --> 29:39.240
Yes. I'm also an employee.DOSEK: Oh, so you admit

29:39.290 --> 29:41.076
that she is running a business
from her apartment.Yes.

29:41.120 --> 29:45.466
Well, that's against
HOA regulations.Is it?

29:45.520 --> 29:48.739
Yes, it is. Now...Well, then why isn't
Mr. Tipton being questioned?

29:48.780 --> 29:51.169
MAN: I don't follow.GRACE: Mr. Graham Tipton.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.949
He runs a business _out of his
apartment on the Sixth floor.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.479
Why isn't he...?
I do not.

29:54.530 --> 29:55.872
Well, you're a day
trader, aren't you?

29:55.920 --> 29:57.820
You work out of your apartment?I work from home.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.529
That's different than running
a business out of my apartment.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.616
But your loan-out company,
Graham Is Awesome, Inc.,

30:01.660 --> 30:03.616
lists this building
as its address,

30:03.670 --> 30:05.353
and your business
receives its mail here.

30:05.410 --> 30:07.366
Are you always available
to sign for it?
No, but...

30:07.410 --> 30:09.401
Okay, look, we are not
on trial here.

30:09.450 --> 30:12.408
The regulations also
prohibit subletting,

30:12.460 --> 30:14.712
but Mrs. Dosek rents
a spare bedroom

30:14.760 --> 30:16.716
in her apartment
to her mother-in-law.

30:16.770 --> 30:18.761
Well, that's my mother-in-law.
There's an exemption for family.

30:18.810 --> 30:21.119
Actually, there isn't.

30:21.160 --> 30:24.118
Then there's Mr. Loring
on the eighth floor,

30:24.170 --> 30:26.070
who frequently hosts
high-priced call girls.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.588
Okay, okay, maybe
we should just

30:28.650 --> 30:29.992
table this discussion
for the moment.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.519
GRACE: I think
that'd be good.

30:31.560 --> 30:33.164
My mother's a great lawyer.

30:33.220 --> 30:35.916
She usually stands up
well for herself.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.339
ROWDY: 'Cause I don't want
to look back and wonder

30:39.400 --> 30:42.358
What if I'd called
your name?

30:42.400 --> 30:44.129
[cell phone chimes]

30:44.190 --> 30:47.876
So won't you
tell me, Lucca...

30:47.930 --> 30:49.147
Oh, no.

30:49.190 --> 30:50.407
I'm singing
my heart out.

30:50.450 --> 30:52.975
How can you answer a text?

30:54.630 --> 30:55.847
You're being sued.

30:55.890 --> 30:58.029
Again?

30:58.070 --> 31:00.197
The label is suing you
for copyright infringement.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.320
Of what?

31:01.380 --> 31:02.984
Another kids' song
they own.

31:03.030 --> 31:04.725
"Moony Moonikins."

31:04.770 --> 31:06.761
$2.8 million in damages.

31:06.820 --> 31:08.037
[scoffs]

31:08.080 --> 31:10.036
My God.

31:10.080 --> 31:13.550
The law just gives so many
people ways to be mean.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.032
You gonna protect me?

31:15.090 --> 31:16.864
Doing my best.

31:22.920 --> 31:25.969
So let's talk about "Moony
Moonikins." You've heard it?

31:26.010 --> 31:28.649
Oh, yeah, of course.You've even played it
in your children's sets.

31:28.710 --> 31:30.098
I usually open my sets with it.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.096
It's, like, every kid's
favorite song.

31:32.150 --> 31:37.975
Yeah, my adopted daughter
from China, she just adores it.

31:38.020 --> 31:39.840
Uh, tell me, how did this work?

31:39.890 --> 31:42.108
Did you just decide
to change it a bit

31:42.160 --> 31:44.060
and then put your name on it,
or...?

31:44.110 --> 31:45.668
No, look, if there's
any similarities

31:45.720 --> 31:47.859
between the two songs, it's
'cause they're both kids songs.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.504
You know, when you're
working with kids

31:49.550 --> 31:51.029
with a shorter attention span,

31:51.080 --> 31:53.423
and there's no sex, drugs,
and rock and roll,

31:53.470 --> 31:55.256
you're somewhat
narrowing your sandbox.

31:55.300 --> 31:57.029
Yet other people have
managed to do that

31:57.080 --> 31:58.638
and not plagiarize, so...

31:58.690 --> 31:59.952
Objection.PAGE: Sustained.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.388
Think I made my point,
Your Honor.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.123
Your witness.LUCCA: Rowby,

32:03.180 --> 32:05.569
can you show us how you composed
"Good Morning Magic Sunshine"?

32:05.610 --> 32:07.953
Objection, Your Honor.No, I'd like to see this.

32:08.010 --> 32:11.480
ROWBY: Uh, so this is
SuperScribe.[banging piano keys]

32:11.530 --> 32:13.998
I play notes on the keyboard,
and then they just populate

32:14.060 --> 32:17.530
into sheet music in real time.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.756
Uh, could you please, uh,
play a little

32:20.800 --> 32:22.756
of "Good Morning
Magic Sunshine"?
Sure.

32:22.810 --> 32:26.029
[playing piano]

32:26.070 --> 32:27.674
Acoustics are actually
pretty good in here.

32:27.720 --> 32:28.937
You guys should
rent it out for gigs.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.469
ALICIA:
Thank you.

32:30.510 --> 32:31.852
Now can you play
"Moony Moonikins"?

32:31.900 --> 32:32.889
Yeah.

32:32.950 --> 32:35.555
[playing piano]

32:35.600 --> 32:38.296
It's catchy, right?

32:38.340 --> 32:42.083
Does no one have kids?Guilty. Adopted
daughter from China.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.997
Could you please superimpose
the two songs you just played?

32:45.050 --> 32:46.859
If they're similar,
they should overlap.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.865
As you can see, Your Honor,

32:48.920 --> 32:50.615
these two songs are
nothing alike.

32:50.660 --> 32:52.048
Objection, Your Honor,
he just left out

32:52.100 --> 32:53.749
the performance elements--
the kazoo,

32:53.790 --> 32:56.839
the squealq toy, the xylophone,
the shakers, the clapping...

32:56.880 --> 32:59.019
Because none of that is
legally copyrightable.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.880
With music,
what you can copyright

33:00.930 --> 33:03.490
is the actual sound recording
or the composition.

33:03.540 --> 33:04.882
ALICIA:
Any similarities here

33:04.930 --> 33:06.716
are the kind that are
not legally protected.

33:07.890 --> 33:09.846
What do you say to that,
Ms. Stevens?

33:11.640 --> 33:13.858
Take this four-note run

33:13.900 --> 33:15.413
from "Magic Sunshine."

33:15.470 --> 33:17.028
[plays notes]

33:17.080 --> 33:19.503
And this four-note run

33:19.560 --> 33:20.902
from "Moony."

33:20.950 --> 33:22.645
[plays notes]

33:22.690 --> 33:24.248
Now look.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.825
They're virtually identical.

33:26.870 --> 33:28.383
ANDREA: _ _ _
So you see major Similarities.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.692
Micro-segments
are exactly the same.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.049
Thank you.ALICIA: If you looked
at micro-segments

33:33.090 --> 33:34.739
in a lot of children's songs,

33:34.790 --> 33:36.519
wouldn't there be
many major Similarities?

33:36.570 --> 33:37.878
No.
For example,

33:37.920 --> 33:39.922
isn't the theme
from SpongeBob Squarepants

33:39.970 --> 33:41.926
Similar to the sea chantey
"Blow the Man Down"?

33:41.970 --> 33:43.619
I-I'm not familiar

33:43.670 --> 33:45.319
with the theme song
you're talking about.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.019
What about the opening
percussion riffs

33:47.060 --> 33:48.925
in the Supremes' version
of "You Can't Hurry Love"

33:48.980 --> 33:51.323
and Iggy Pop's "Lust for Life"?
Aren't they identical?

33:51.370 --> 33:53.418
You know, I... [sighs]
I'm not prepared to say that.

33:53.460 --> 33:54.893
Well, what about the chorus riff

33:54.940 --> 33:55.895
in Boston's
"More Than a Feeling"

33:55.940 --> 33:58.374
and "Louie Louie"
by the Kingsmen?

33:58.420 --> 33:59.728
Objection, Your Honor.
This is not Name That Tune.

33:59.770 --> 34:00.759
PAGE:
This is getting

34:00.820 --> 34:01.980
a bit ridiculous.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.940
And that's our point.

34:03.990 --> 34:06.163
When you break a song down
into small enough components,

34:06.210 --> 34:07.859
you'll always find similarities.

34:07.910 --> 34:09.036
Don't break them down, then,
Your Honor.

34:09.090 --> 34:09.954
Just listen to them together.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.082
Okay, okay, I've heard enough.

34:12.130 --> 34:14.086
I will take this
under advisement.

34:14.130 --> 34:17.008
We'll reconvene for my
decision this afternoon.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.950
MONICA:
I found myself

34:19.010 --> 34:21.786
wrong about this firm,
so I gave it a second chance.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.398
She gave me a second chance.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.661
You say Bea Wilson is returning?

34:26.710 --> 34:27.790
Yes.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.966
Uh, she's thinking of returning.

34:29.020 --> 34:30.794
DAVID: She wasn't thrilled
with having

34:30.850 --> 34:32.932

out of an apartment bUIIdlng.

34:32.980 --> 34:34.368

34:34.420 --> 34:35.455
There's this
horrible woman there.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.626
Yes,

34:36.680 --> 34:38.102
Alicia can be quite trying.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.809
I don't think she means...

34:41.600 --> 34:44.068
Let me just close this.

34:46.860 --> 34:48.771
ANDREA:_ You know this could
go either way, right?

34:48.820 --> 34:49.866
Let's settle.

34:49.910 --> 34:50.990
What have you got?

34:51.040 --> 34:52.211
We can't break our contracts.

34:52.260 --> 34:53.693
It would set a bad precedent,

34:53.740 --> 34:55.901
but we could give Rowby
a few points.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.825
A few? Seriously?

34:57.870 --> 34:59.041
Where's Rowby?

34:59.090 --> 35:00.478
Maybe he Should hear this.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.354
We're late.
It's okay.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.129
[elevator bell dings]They can't start without us.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.657
Ms. Dunne?

35:06.710 --> 35:08.098
How are you?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.573
Good. Just going.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.928
I see that.

35:10.970 --> 35:13.234
You're dropping by
the office tomorrow, right?

35:13.280 --> 35:14.975
Right.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.804
You okay?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.067
That's one of our new clients.

35:20.110 --> 35:22.066
So?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.065
What's She doing here?

35:24.120 --> 35:25.894
They're stealing our clients.

35:25.940 --> 35:26.941
You should've seen her.

35:26.990 --> 35:28.548
She looked so guilty.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.114
Yes, Alicia Florrick
for Lila Dunne, please.

35:33.000 --> 35:33.944
I see.

35:34.000 --> 35:34.944
When will She

35:35.000 --> 35:35.898
be back in?

35:35.950 --> 35:37.599
They screwed us.Thank you.

35:39.180 --> 35:40.909
Who else could they be
going after?

35:40.960 --> 35:43.087
We haven't seen_ Bea Wilson
in a while.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.949
She was supposed
to call yesterday.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.910
That would be bad.And Cary.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.483
Cary's been screwing us
the whole time.

35:48.530 --> 35:50.088
[phone rings]

35:50.140 --> 35:52.096
Alicia Florrick.

35:52.150 --> 35:53.924
Okay. We're on our way.

35:53.970 --> 35:55.790
Judge Page,
She's made a decision.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.011
You go.

35:57.060 --> 35:58.664
I'm gonna stay here
and call our clients.

36:05.850 --> 36:07.112
Hey, what's up?

36:07.160 --> 36:09.116
Hey, man.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.503
Andrea has another offer.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.073
Go to hell.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.678
Excuse me?

36:14.730 --> 36:16.038

All rise.

36:16.080 --> 36:20.084

Good morning,
magic sunshine

36:20.130 --> 36:21.643
It's a brand-new day...

36:21.700 --> 36:23.509
She likes it. She likes me.

36:23.570 --> 36:26.038
PAGE:
Okay, this is what I know.

36:26.090 --> 36:29.082
"Good Morning, Magic Sunshine"
is a good song.

36:29.140 --> 36:31.131
And I don't even have kids.

36:31.180 --> 36:33.922
But when you start
to chop it up,

36:33.970 --> 36:35.961
deconstruct it,
you stop hearing it.

36:36.010 --> 36:39.753
And that's not how you're
supposed to listen to music.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.971
When I'm just experiencing

36:41.020 --> 36:43.238
these songs
and not analyzing them,

36:43.280 --> 36:45.145
they sound the same.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.679
They simply have
too much in common

36:46.720 --> 36:48.711
for this to be a coincidence.

36:48.770 --> 36:49.839
So...

36:49.900 --> 36:52.118
based on the evidence presented,

36:52.160 --> 36:54.287
I concluded, Mr. Canton,

36:54.340 --> 36:56.467
you stole that song.

Summary judgment

37:02.040 --> 37:04.429
But, Bea, just give us a chance.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.302
The advantage to working
with a small firm is dedication.

37:08.350 --> 37:11.046
We don't split our duties.

37:11.090 --> 37:12.227
Okay.

37:12.270 --> 37:13.658
I'll await your call.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.782
Can I help, Mom?

37:15.840 --> 37:17.262
Make any calls?

37:18.490 --> 37:19.536
No, I'm good.

37:19.580 --> 37:20.660
No, seriously,

37:20.710 --> 37:21.790
I'm done with all my homework.

37:23.060 --> 37:25.051
Okay, then we should talk.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.327
Uh-oh. [chuckles]

37:26.370 --> 37:27.587
Is it one of those talks?

37:27.630 --> 37:28.801
Yes.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.101
I'm afraid it is.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.026
You know how much
I love you, right?

37:33.070 --> 37:35.026
And how much I appreciate

37:35.070 --> 37:36.674
everything you're
doing here,

37:36.730 --> 37:38.334
for the firm, for me.

37:38.380 --> 37:40.245
Mom, if it's about my grades,
I can bring them up.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.335
I promise you.You need to stop

37:41.380 --> 37:43.257
working at Florrick/Quinn.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.033
You're firing me?

37:48.300 --> 37:49.824
Yes, I am.

37:49.870 --> 37:51.041
But that's not fair.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.341
I've been doing
such a good job.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.129
Yes, you have.

37:54.180 --> 37:56.171
You have been doing
an amazing job.

37:56.230 --> 37:57.709
Too amazing, in fact.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.524
So you're firing me
for doing too good a job?

37:59.580 --> 38:00.569
That has to be illegal.

38:00.620 --> 38:02.349
Grace,

38:02.410 --> 38:05.538
you need to start focusing
on yourfuture, not mine.

38:05.580 --> 38:06.797
Mom, you need me.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.182
Yes, as a daughter,

38:08.240 --> 38:10.458
I so, so do.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.149
But as a mother--

38:12.200 --> 38:14.065
as your mother--

38:14.110 --> 38:16.988
I need to be taking care of you,

38:17.030 --> 38:18.247
not the reverse.

38:19.640 --> 38:21.153
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

38:22.380 --> 38:23.813
I understand.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.555
You want me to butt
out of your life.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.295
No.

38:29.210 --> 38:30.996
My business.

38:31.040 --> 38:33.952
Mom, you can't fire me
and hug me at the same time.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.434
Oh, yes, I can. [chuckles]

38:43.360 --> 38:45.180
Are you sad?

38:45.230 --> 38:46.663
Well, kind of.

38:46.710 --> 38:47.756
I don't like losing.

38:47.800 --> 38:49.756
Yeah, me neither.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.671
'Cause, Lucca

38:56.720 --> 38:58.631
When you're near me

38:58.680 --> 39:01.854
All is plain to see

39:03.420 --> 39:05.024
That, Lucca

39:05.080 --> 39:08.299
All that matters

39:08.340 --> 39:10.467
Is you with me.

39:16.910 --> 39:19.299
[song ends]

39:19.350 --> 39:20.601
That's wonderful.

39:20.660 --> 39:21.957
Thanks.

39:22.010 --> 39:23.784
Sell it.
[groans]

39:23.830 --> 39:25.707
To who?
To anyone.

39:26.710 --> 39:28.268
Yeah?

39:29.620 --> 39:32.407
Change the name, though.

39:32.450 --> 39:34.270
Whoa, where you going?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.582
Back to real life.

39:40.550 --> 39:42.677
What was this?

39:42.720 --> 39:43.800
[knocking]

39:47.030 --> 39:48.986
So, you screwed us.

39:49.030 --> 39:50.907
You mean did we try to poach
the clients you poached from us?

39:50.950 --> 39:52.292
Did you?
Yes.

39:52.340 --> 39:54.205
Great. Congratulations.

39:54.260 --> 39:55.773
They said no.

39:55.820 --> 39:57.549
We can't get ahold
of our clients.

39:57.610 --> 39:59.828
Yeah, because they're
saying no to you, too.

39:59.870 --> 40:01.565
What does that mean?

40:01.610 --> 40:02.918
They want you as lawyers,

40:02.960 --> 40:04.211
but they want
our infrastructure.

40:04.270 --> 40:05.658
And if they can't have both,

40:05.700 --> 40:06.746
they're gonna keep looking.

40:06.790 --> 40:08.485
How do you know that?They said it.

40:08.530 --> 40:10.179
So why are you here?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.706
Come back to Lockhart/Agos.

40:18.540 --> 40:20.019
No.
Why not?

40:20.060 --> 40:21.618
You fired me.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.669
And I've never worked there.

40:22.720 --> 40:25.029
We want you back.

40:25.070 --> 40:26.935
And we want you
to come with her.

40:28.900 --> 40:30.856
Diane does?

40:30.900 --> 40:33.687
Well, She understands
the situation.

40:36.860 --> 40:39.249
Thank you,
but I'm not interested.

40:39.300 --> 40:40.608
If you change your mind...

40:40.650 --> 40:42.254
I won't. Thank you.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.608
Bye.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.655
Shall we at least discuss this?

40:49.700 --> 40:52.487
Okay.
We're working
out of your apartment.

40:52.530 --> 40:54.088
We still have 70% DUIs.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.051
We're barely making ends meet.

40:56.100 --> 40:59.058
And we may have just lost
our top four clients.

40:59.100 --> 41:00.579
And we don't have
to answer to anyone.

41:00.630 --> 41:01.881
Because no one else wants US.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.361
Do you want to go
and work for a big firm?

41:06.420 --> 41:07.842
I don't know.

41:07.900 --> 41:09.413
Maybe.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.467
Well, I can't.

41:14.730 --> 41:16.379
So what do we do?[knocking]

41:16.430 --> 41:17.988
Oh, dear God.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.519
[sighs]

41:22.300 --> 41:23.551
You have to forgive my dad.

41:23.610 --> 41:24.770
Marissa.

41:24.830 --> 41:27.697
I'm not here for him.
I'm here for me.

41:27.740 --> 41:28.786
Hi.

41:28.830 --> 41:30.343
Hi. I'll leave you to it.

41:33.010 --> 41:34.170
Did I interrupt something?

41:34.230 --> 41:35.219
Yes.

41:35.270 --> 41:36.783
[sighs]

41:36.840 --> 41:38.444
My dad cares about you, Alicia.

41:38.490 --> 41:40.185
He only confessed
to you what he did

41:40.230 --> 41:41.572
because he was
torn up about it.

41:41.620 --> 41:43.224
He never had to confess.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.577
You wouldn't have known.

41:44.630 --> 41:45.619
No one would've known.

41:45.670 --> 41:47.797
But he cares about you.

41:47.850 --> 41:50.193
And my dad doesn't care
about many people.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.061
Yes, he did wrong,
but let him apologize.

41:53.110 --> 41:54.896
Let him...

41:54.940 --> 41:56.669
What?

41:56.730 --> 41:58.812
You're looking at me like
you want to tell me something.

41:58.860 --> 41:59.895
Get lost? Go to hell?

42:02.820 --> 42:04.071
No.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.859
Then what?

42:09.570 --> 42:11.435
I hurt.

42:14.480 --> 42:15.651
I'm sorry.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.742
It hurt me.

42:18.790 --> 42:20.576
He knows that.

42:23.670 --> 42:25.797
Then he can't expect
anything more of me.

42:25.840 --> 42:29.059
It would be unfair for him
to expect anything more.

42:33.070 --> 42:35.937
Then let me say something.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.323
Something very small.

42:38.380 --> 42:40.371
Call him up and say,
"You're forgiven.

42:40.420 --> 42:42.593
"I need some time
to not deal with you,

42:42.640 --> 42:44.369
but you're forgiven."

42:46.300 --> 42:47.779
I can't.

42:47.820 --> 42:49.868
Please?

42:52.740 --> 42:55.208
Marissa, I...

43:00.180 --> 43:01.693
No.
