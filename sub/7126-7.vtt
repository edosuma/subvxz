I don't know why I said awesome.
It's not, it's awkward.

- Yeah.

- You're Canadian?
- Yeah, why?

Seriously, you need a handler.
You cannot be left alone.

to be separate.

that movie <i>Australia </i>with me.

starring Hugh Jackman.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.792

what it is that he does.

No, don't, because I spent one day
at Chase's office and it ruined him.

- Meaning?

If you're talking about me,

19:31.250 --> 19:32.375
Daddy, I'm--

19:33.959 --> 19:35.542
Owen, I have to talk to my father.

19:35.542 --> 19:36.834
- Okay?
- Okay, I'll go.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.417
- He has the hatchet.
- Right, right.

19:38.417 --> 19:39.917
I'll call you.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.875
Daddy.

19:43.875 --> 19:48.250
I was not choosing Owen over you.
Okay?

19:48.250 --> 19:50.166
You don't wanna run
the family business, fine.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.667
It's no problem.

19:51.667 --> 19:52.959
I'm sorry.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.917
I love you,
but I just could not do what you do.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.000
- Yeah, because you don't approve.
- No.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.542
No, because I couldn't do it,
which is why it's good that you do.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.166
Look, lots of us,
we eat chicken and hamburgers

20:07.166 --> 20:09.083
and we don't have to think
about how we get it

20:09.083 --> 20:12.875
because people like you
protect us from having to.

20:12.875 --> 20:14.667
Like a dad.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.500
You know, I knew the farm
wasn't right for you.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.208
But when you dropped by the office,

20:21.208 --> 20:25.125
it was like you were my little girl again
and I was your hero.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.959
Dad, you still are.

20:27.375 --> 20:28.583
No.

20:28.583 --> 20:31.667
You got a great guy now.
And he is, he's great.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.166
I just don't think I handled it well.

20:35.166 --> 20:38.250
Well, the reason
I can pick a great guy

20:38.250 --> 20:42.000
is because I have a fantastic one
for a dad.

20:46.709 --> 20:48.291
Now, hamburger production.

20:48.291 --> 20:50.375
Boy, oh, boy,
you wanna talk about nightmares.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.917
- I mean, these--
- Shh.

20:56.208 --> 21:00.500
SAMANTHA: <i>Ernest Hemingway once</i>
<i>said that life is a moveable feast.</i>

21:02.583 --> 21:05.709
<i>I think what he meant is that</i>
<i>there's an instinctive human desire</i>

21:05.709 --> 21:08.625
<i>to mix the ingredients of our lives.</i>

21:10.792 --> 21:12.917
<i>Preparing a far richer meal</i>

21:12.917 --> 21:15.417
<i>than if those ingredients</i>
<i>had never come together.</i>

21:15.417 --> 21:17.875
So this parrot
walks into a taco stand--

21:17.875 --> 21:19.166
- Daddy, no.
- Oh, no, Howard.

21:19.166 --> 21:21.125
No. You're not telling that.
