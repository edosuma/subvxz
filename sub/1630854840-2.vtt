WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:04.504
Salt chicken?

00:05.171 --> 00:07.132
How spicy does it say it needs to be?

00:07.215 --> 00:08.883
Uh, it just says spicy food.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.552
I assume the spicier, the better, though.

00:10.635 --> 00:13.471
It must stimulate something in your body
to bring the power out.

00:14.055 --> 00:16.683
-What can I get for you?
-I'll have the spiciest thing on the menu.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.101
No.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.813
I-- I have a large bottle of sriracha mayo
at home.

00:21.896 --> 00:23.606
I think I can handle some spice.

00:35.118 --> 00:37.078
Well? Feeling anything yet?

00:37.162 --> 00:39.831
-I just can't feel my legs.
-This can't be right.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.583
What else do they recommend?

00:43.126 --> 00:48.298
Uh, long walks, castor oil, sex,
stimulation of the nipples--

00:48.381 --> 00:50.675
Kash, you're looking at
how to induce labour.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.720
No, I'm not.
Oh, how dilated is your cervix?

00:55.138 --> 00:57.057
Milk. Need milk.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.078
-Jen?

01:24.209 --> 01:26.503
Oh, hey. Hey, what's up?

01:27.337 --> 01:29.714
-You all right?
-Who, me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:31.549 --> 01:32.550
What you got there?

01:32.634 --> 01:35.637
Wine, condoms, Pringles.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.472
Date night?

01:37.555 --> 01:41.017
No. No, it's none of my business.
I don't need to know. I don't care.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.520
Basically, as soon as you leave
my eyeline, you're dead to me.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.105
You're sweating a lot.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.066
No, I'm not.

01:49.317 --> 01:50.944
All right. Well, I'll see you around then.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.487
Yeah, maybe. Maybe not.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.574
You shouldn't buy that milk. It's open.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.342
Sweaty, young lady.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.511
You've got to buy the milk
before you drink it.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.531
I've tried to do the research
about what brings powers out,

02:36.614 --> 02:38.658
but it's all anecdotal.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.410
You'd think, after ten years,

02:40.493 --> 02:43.621
there'd at least be
some decent peer-reviewed studies.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.331
Where are all the peers?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.458
What do the anecdotes say?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.377
Common themes crop up.

02:49.460 --> 02:52.964
Fear, anxiety, stress, adrenaline.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.550
Oh, yeah. Adrenaline is where it's at.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.968
Life and death, right?

02:57.051 --> 02:59.679
Russian roulette, diffusing bombs,

02:59.762 --> 03:01.723
-or we could just push you off a bridge.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.143
Oi! You can't spend your shift
chatting with your mates.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.854
This is a place of work,
not a discotheque.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.189
He's a paying customer.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.691
Look, he's buying a bunch of dumb shit
for his superhero costume.

03:11.774 --> 03:15.653
It's actually a vigilante costume--
Uniform. It's not a costume.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.615
We're talking about
how people got their powers.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.994
Oh, in that case, park yourself.
I've got a yarn for you.

03:23.828 --> 03:24.871
Picture this.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.832
Come back here early from a trip
to the wholesalers in Penge.

03:27.916 --> 03:33.046
I walk into the stockroom to find
my husband, of 30 years,

03:33.129 --> 03:35.006
giving it to Raquel.

03:35.089 --> 03:40.261
Well, I'm screaming. He's screaming.
Raquel's crying. It's all very stressful.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.387
Then bang!

03:41.471 --> 03:43.514
They look at me like I've got two heads.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.559
Turn to look in the mirror.
There's a little girl staring back at me.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.853
Sounds like stress
is a good place to start then.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.939
Just don't do it on company time, yeah?

03:51.022 --> 03:52.523
Big smiles for the customers.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.322
I know what to do.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.617
What?

04:03.618 --> 04:05.286
It's gonna be a surprise.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.580
You are gonna hate it.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.125
Okay. All right. Fuck me up.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.046
I want you to promise me
you're not gonna run away.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.340
Carrie, I'm not five.
I'm not gonna run away.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.935
-Come on.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.437
-Jen!
-No, I hate you.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.733
Hello, have you got an appointment?

04:35.817 --> 04:36.734
Fuck you.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.988
Jen Regan. 11.15.

04:40.571 --> 04:42.365
Okay. Jen…

04:42.448 --> 04:43.825
I don't think I can do this.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.828
-Do you want a power or not?
-I do. I really do.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.706
-Who's a brave little bitch?
-I'm a brave little bitch.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.040
-You can do this.
-I can do this.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.458
-Jennifer Regan.
-Okay.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.110
Can you hear that?

05:19.193 --> 05:20.403
The ominous music?

05:20.486 --> 05:21.487
Yeah.

05:22.113 --> 05:25.074
I keep telling reception to warn people
before they come in.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.242
It's my power.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.162
I make people generate
their own soundtrack around me.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.540
I'm going to assume
you're afraid of the dentist?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.000
No.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.545
Shall we get started?

05:49.474 --> 05:51.100
<i>Prices start at £3,000.</i>

05:51.184 --> 05:53.227
-Three grand? It's just a billboard.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:55.063
<i>Well, it's so big. Gloss is expensive.</i>

05:55.146 --> 05:56.147
All right, okay.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.359
Oh, what if I put it up myself?

05:59.442 --> 06:00.568
-Mm-hmm.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.778
<i>Yourself? With what?</i>

06:01.861 --> 06:03.613
-PVA.
-<i>I can't see that working.</i>

06:03.696 --> 06:05.490
No, I do think that would work, actually.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.368
-No! Don't put me on hold, Diane.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.405
Hello?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.118
Not cat.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.453
Man.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.331
-<i>We've got…</i>

06:58.000 --> 07:02.255
Look, Diane, don't try and upsell me
on 200 gsm gloss, okay?

07:02.338 --> 07:03.673
This isn't my first rodeo.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.175
<i>Well,</i>
<i>you don't wanna skimp on the high gsm.</i>

07:07.969 --> 07:09.178
Uh, one minute.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.903
Oh, what about a charity discount?

07:27.864 --> 07:32.910
Yes, my charity number is 24.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.919
Right, let's take a look.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.395
I am so sorry.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.860
Well, the good news is
you have quite nice teeth.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.613
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:10.281 --> 08:13.576
The bad news is we're going to have
to do quite a few fillings today.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.414
All right, I can't listen to this.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.791
I'm going to give you something
to help you relax.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.591
Valium. It will alleviate your anxiety.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.886
No. No, no. I need to be anxious.
I need to feel the fear.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.471
Suit yourself.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.816
<i>Viper to Unicorn. Pick up.</i>

08:45.900 --> 08:49.111
<i>Update status on Jen.</i>
<i>Should I initiate Plan B? Over.</i>

08:50.238 --> 08:52.156
No. Plan A is in progress,

08:52.240 --> 08:54.200
and I actually think
it's going quite well.

08:54.283 --> 08:56.118
So, over.

08:57.370 --> 09:00.081
<i>No. Can I initiate Plan D later? Over.</i>

09:01.207 --> 09:02.208
What's Plan D?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.546
It's your dick, isn't it?

09:07.672 --> 09:09.173
<i>It's my dick. Over.</i>

09:14.220 --> 09:17.014
Yes. I am ready for Plan D.

09:17.098 --> 09:22.520
Meet me at 69 hundred hours. Over.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.068
My angel! Hi.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.112
Did it happen?

09:31.195 --> 09:32.321
Did you get a power?

09:32.905 --> 09:34.574
I've had one this whole time.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.868
-Power of friendship.
-She's been given Valium.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.579
So you're going to
have to take care of her

09:39.662 --> 09:41.914
for the next three to four hours
before it wears off.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.296
Initiate Plan D-- B! I mean Plan B. Over.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.049
You know who's under-rated?

09:52.133 --> 09:55.886
Simon & Garfunkel. Just two lovely boys.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.524
Get up! Get up now,
you big English bastard!

10:08.608 --> 10:12.278
-Am I the bastard?
-Do as I say, and I won't kneecap ya!

10:12.361 --> 10:14.071
-So I won't.
-What are you doing?

10:14.155 --> 10:20.369
Shh. I'm conducting a campaign of terror
on the mainland. So I am.

10:22.622 --> 10:26.542
Hit the boot, would you?
Hit the boot for a united Ireland!

10:27.501 --> 10:28.919
-Get in!

10:33.716 --> 10:36.052
-Who are you supposed to be?
-I'm being a terrorist.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.346
What's more stressful
than being kidnapped by a terrorist?

10:38.429 --> 10:41.849
Why the IRA? Why not, like, al-Qaeda?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.186
Fuck. That would've made a lot more sense.

10:47.229 --> 10:48.230
What now?

10:48.814 --> 10:51.317
Uh, get lunch? I'm starving.

10:52.777 --> 10:56.113
Oh! Right. Yeah, let her stew in there
with her thoughts for a bit.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.074
Nothing worse
than the fear of the unknown, right?

11:12.254 --> 11:14.757
Ignore? You can't ignore me.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.220
<i>It's Luke. Do the thing.</i>

11:19.845 --> 11:24.183
-Oh. Hi, Luke! Lucas!

11:24.809 --> 11:26.227
Is that short for Lucas?

11:26.310 --> 11:29.563
I don't even know your name--
Did you ever tell me your actual name?

11:30.481 --> 11:32.483
Love, I feel--

11:32.566 --> 11:34.985
I have a lot of feelings about you.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.154
Number one: horny.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.657
Number two: love.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.159
Is it love? I don't know, but--

11:42.243 --> 11:44.704
Oh, you make me feel special,
and I like that.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.664
And I hope it's real.

11:46.747 --> 11:51.168
But, Luke, you don't go on outside dates
with me or introduce me to your friends.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.004
And that just makes me feel bad.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.258
But i-is that normal? Do I want too much?

11:57.341 --> 11:58.718
What is love?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.344
Also, you have such a pretty cock,

12:00.428 --> 12:03.264
and it's like, you know,
we don't tell men this enough. You know?

12:03.347 --> 12:05.057
Like, they have body-image issues too.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.435
-Cheese and tomato.
-Yeah.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.771
-Smoked salmon and cream cheese.
-Okay.

12:11.731 --> 12:12.982
-Egg and cress.
-Yeah.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.025
-Ploughman's.
-Mmm.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.652
-Tuna mayo.
-Mm-hmm.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.654
-BLT.
-Mm-hmm.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.198
-Reuben.
-Mmm.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.742
Bagel?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.243
Is a bagel a sandwich?

12:24.326 --> 12:25.453
Well, it's carb, filling, carb.

12:25.536 --> 12:29.290
Well, if you say that, then
a croque monsieur could be a sandwich.

12:29.373 --> 12:31.250
Yeah, a croque monsieur is a sandwich.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.419
How dare you?

12:33.502 --> 12:37.673
Who are you? Like, right?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.049
I wanna know you.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.469
I wanna know your security questions.
You know?

12:41.552 --> 12:44.472
Like, what street did you grow up on?
Or, like, what--

12:44.555 --> 12:45.556
-Oh!

12:45.639 --> 12:46.724
All right. Chill out.

12:47.224 --> 12:49.769
Or, you know, like,
what's your mother's maiden name?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.104
I wanna know the names of your dead pets.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.023
-Oh, my God.
-Mm-hmm.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.444
-A burger is just a sandwich.
-Mmm.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.991
-Oh, my God, Carrie.
-What?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.369
That pigeon's got a whole croissant.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.167
Oh, my God.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.585
I know. Look at him go.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.086
The car. The car!

13:17.296 --> 13:18.297
Oh, right.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.105
Oh. One minute,
I've got a call coming through. Okay.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.025
Oh, hey, girl!

13:38.108 --> 13:40.611
Jen, are you okay? Don't panic.

13:40.694 --> 13:43.072
I love you. Everything's gonna be okay.
Don't panic.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.156
Why would I panic?

13:44.240 --> 13:45.407
You're stuck in a boot.

13:46.450 --> 13:47.576
Oh, yeah.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.120
Jen, I want you
to listen to me very carefully.

13:50.204 --> 13:52.373
Go to messenger
and drop me a pin of your location.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.210
Okey-dokey, there we go.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.631
You sent me a picture
of Phillip Schofield.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.466
I did? Oh, let me try again.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.389
It's the same picture
of Phillip Schofield.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.140
Well, then I don't know
what you want me to do.

14:10.224 --> 14:12.893
Just drop me a pin
so I can come get you, Jennifer!

14:12.977 --> 14:14.270
<i>Ooh.</i>

14:14.353 --> 14:16.105
I'm in trouble.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.116
When we get the car released,
don't mention Jen's in the boot.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.450
Just play it cool.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.746
Uh-- uh, one-- one little thing,
that's Mum's car.

14:32.830 --> 14:33.831
Okay.

14:33.914 --> 14:37.126
Uh, and technically, uh,
I'm not allowed to drive it,

14:37.209 --> 14:40.880
uh, because I don't have a licence.

14:41.839 --> 14:42.840
Oh, God.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.678
I don't wanna go to jail.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.014
Sure, I'll get ripped,
make friends for life.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.433
But how am I gonna explain
the gap on my CV?

14:52.516 --> 14:54.685
Relax, it's our property.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.812
There's nothing dodgy
about what we're doing.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.022
We don't need to hide.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.584
Jen, are you in there?

15:18.667 --> 15:21.629
Hey! What are you guys doing here?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.297
We've come to spring you out.

15:23.380 --> 15:25.257
Okay. Sick.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.227
I haven't got the key.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.689
You do have the key.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.526
You have so many pockets.
How do you not have the key?

15:45.653 --> 15:46.779
No, they're not there.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.907
Uh. Uh, l-let me check again.

15:49.990 --> 15:53.077
-They're not there. Oh, God.
-Well, how long till the Valium wears off?

15:53.661 --> 15:57.039
They said three to four hours,
and it's been exactly…

16:00.334 --> 16:01.752
…four hours.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.513
Oh. I guess we have a little longer.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.890
Get me out of this fucking boot!
Don't do this! Fuck!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.309
Let me go! Let me out! Let me out!

16:17.393 --> 16:19.395
Why you fucking closing me in?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.271
Oh.

16:21.355 --> 16:26.110
Jen. Little hiccup, we don't have the key.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.945
What do you mean
you don't have the fucking key?

16:28.028 --> 16:30.155
Get a key ring, you dumb bitch.
They sell them everywhere.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.700
Oh, my God, I'm really sorry.
I'm very stressed right now.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.451
Stand back, ladies.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.831
-Oh.

16:38.914 --> 16:40.916
I assume whatever he did,
didn't work, yeah?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.214
-Jen.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.217
We're gonna need some brute force
to get you out.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.929
Someone strong.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.472
No. No-- No way.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.766
Do you have any idea
how smug she'd be about it?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.310
She'd be all like, "Well, well, well."

17:01.770 --> 17:03.397
She's not a panto villain.

17:03.480 --> 17:06.400
Well, well, well…

17:07.776 --> 17:08.986
Are you okay in there?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.613
Get bent!

17:12.364 --> 17:14.658
Okay, well,
I guess you don't need my help.

17:14.742 --> 17:15.743
I'll fuck off then.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.787
No, no, don't. Don't get bent.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.959
I'm more than happy to help you out
if you ask me nicely.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.545
Let me out, please.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.882
We can be nicer than that. Can't we?

17:29.965 --> 17:30.966
Something like,

17:31.050 --> 17:37.264
"Andy, please save me
from my own monumentally stupid choices

17:37.347 --> 17:41.351
because I'm a powerless loser
with thin, lifeless hair."

17:47.733 --> 17:51.779
Andy, please save me
from my own monumentally stupid choices

17:51.862 --> 17:55.032
because I'm a powerless loser
with thin, lifeless hair.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.246
Don't!

18:04.166 --> 18:06.043
You little shit,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

18:06.126 --> 18:09.254
I just saved your life. I'm a hero.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.215
It's okay. You're out now.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.258
Thank you, Andy.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
Jennifer!

18:18.180 --> 18:20.140
-Jen! Jen, we're here.
-Jennifer!

18:20.224 --> 18:21.725
Why did you bring Mum here?

18:23.977 --> 18:28.357
How, and why, in the name of God,
did you get stuck in a boot?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.942
I don't need to explain my life to you.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.735
Yes, I can pay for it, Mummy.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.363
-Carrie, can I borrow £300?
-Yeah.

18:34.446 --> 18:38.325
You could've suffocated!
Thank God Andy was there.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.787
It's not airtight, and Andy was only there
because I called her.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.958
I wasn't in so much life-threatening peril
that I couldn't use my phone.

18:47.209 --> 18:51.046
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't be real.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.340
So weird though.
The boot lid was gone when I borrowed it.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.802
-I left Luke a voice mail.
-I'll call you back. It's all kicking off.

18:56.885 --> 18:59.054
-Who's Luke?
-Her fuck buddy.

18:59.638 --> 19:02.099
Oh, sorry, Mary. Uh, her fudge buddy.

19:02.182 --> 19:03.308
Oh, that sounds worse.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.062
No. Fix it. Use your power.
Like, delete it or recall it or something.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.692
-Well, where is it then?
-No.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.443
No! Press the phone button, Mum.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.571
Oh, Christ! I think I'm calling somebody.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.781
Okay, look, voice mail. There.
Now click the voice mail.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.283
It's written there in plain English.

19:19.366 --> 19:20.742
-Look, just click it!

19:20.826 --> 19:22.661
<i>…dates with me or introduce me to…</i>

19:22.744 --> 19:24.538
Don't cast it to the car, Mum!

19:24.621 --> 19:27.082
<i>But is that normal? Do I want too much?</i>

19:27.166 --> 19:29.501
-Fuck!
-I don't know how I'm doing this!

19:29.585 --> 19:31.336
<i>Also, you have such a pretty cock…</i>

19:37.676 --> 19:38.677
Oh, my God.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.435
Why don't you just spam him
with something else?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.270
Distract him,
and he won't look at his voice mail.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.438
Andy, stop.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.275
Oh, my God. That's a really good idea.

19:53.358 --> 19:57.654
Yeah, okay, what could I possibly send him
that could, um, distract him that much?

20:06.038 --> 20:10.000
Even I know you should send him
a dirty picture. Jesus Christ.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.631
Not now.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.317
What do you think? Full show?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.844
-What the fuck?
-I'm not a man, I'm a cat.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.597
No, no, no. I-I'm a man, not a cat.
I'm a man!

21:05.681 --> 21:07.766
Oh, my God. You can see me.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.269
You can see me. Please help me.
Please-- It's okay.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.604
Ow.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.700
What's going on? We heard screaming.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.201
I've got my power.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.871
-I've got magic tits.
-Oh.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.669
Cat sees my tits. Cat turns into man.

21:35.752 --> 21:39.298
My tits turn cats into men.
It's pretty straightforward.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.551
Maybe it's all animals.
We should go to the zoo.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.637
No! I-I'm a man! Just a man!

21:45.721 --> 21:49.099
I-I'm a shape-shifter.
I think I got a bit stuck!

21:50.183 --> 21:51.601
Well, that is what a cat would say.

21:51.685 --> 21:53.145
What if he's telling the truth?

22:01.903 --> 22:02.904
Oh, Jesus.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.241
You can see me.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.209
You can see me.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.518
What's your name?

22:34.811 --> 22:35.812
Mmm.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.400
No idea.

22:40.984 --> 22:42.027
Where are you from?

22:43.362 --> 22:44.363
I don't know.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.616
What do you remember?

22:47.699 --> 22:50.494
I remember I went to the--
the building place.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.121
The chairs thing.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.582
It's like, um, child prison.

22:55.665 --> 22:56.958
-Oh, school?
-Yeah.

22:57.042 --> 23:00.337
Yeah, and I went somewhere every day,
so I must've had a--

23:00.921 --> 23:03.632
It's, like, sadness but money?

23:03.715 --> 23:04.549
A job?

23:04.633 --> 23:05.634
Yeah.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.095
And then cat.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.346
Until a few days ago.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.139
Then, boom. Man.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.767
Then cat again. I think I'm good now.
I'm "stablay."

23:14.935 --> 23:15.977
Do you mean stable?

23:16.645 --> 23:19.731
I do, yeah. Words come bad to me now.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.484
Oh, my God. I had sex in front of you.

23:23.777 --> 23:28.573
Oh, sex! I remember sex. It's good stuff.

23:28.657 --> 23:30.117
So, you're a pervert?

23:31.451 --> 23:32.744
I don't think so.

23:34.621 --> 23:37.707
Uh, what's the last thing you remember
before you went cat?

23:37.791 --> 23:39.543
Oh, boy. Um.

23:40.168 --> 23:43.713
School, job, something, something,

23:43.797 --> 23:46.883
Spurs beat Arsenal 4-2 at home,
then I think cat.

23:46.967 --> 23:48.677
Something, something. Now.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.053
Wait. Go back.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.221
Something, something.

23:51.304 --> 23:53.849
No. Jesus Christ.
Spurs beat Arsenal…

23:53.932 --> 23:56.935
4-2 at home. Yeah, I remember that.
Why do I remember that?

23:57.018 --> 23:59.020
-It's probably the last match he saw.
-Yeah, yeah.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.105
I hope not.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.533
How long do you think you've been away?

24:12.534 --> 24:15.120
Long time. Few weeks maybe?

24:17.998 --> 24:19.833
That match was three years ago.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.265
All right. I've ordered an Uber.

24:35.348 --> 24:36.349
For who?

24:38.268 --> 24:40.353
-Kash.
-You can't do that.

24:40.437 --> 24:44.065
What, are you just gonna drive him out
to the countryside and abandon him?

24:44.149 --> 24:48.778
No, I can't afford to go that far.
I'm sending him to Ilford.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.740
I took him in.
I can't just chuck him out again.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.033
He's my responsibility.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.078
He's only here
till he figures out who he is.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.581
Then we fob him off
on someone who actually knows him.

24:59.664 --> 25:01.166
-Fine.
-Fine.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.375
He stays out of my room.

25:06.588 --> 25:07.589
What now then?

25:08.089 --> 25:11.259
I don't know.
Suppose I can get rid of the litter tray.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.385
Or do I get a big one?

25:12.469 --> 25:14.888
No. Do you want me
to keep trying to make you afraid?

25:15.555 --> 25:18.558
Carrie, if that didn't shake a power
out of me, I don't think anything will.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.981
Do you think my power
could still be tit-based?

25:25.065 --> 25:26.566
100%. Yeah.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.152
To me,
they're pretty powerful as they are.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.154
One's a bit more powerful than the other.
But…

25:33.782 --> 25:36.117
I'll make your powerful tits some tea.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.424
Just wanted to make sure.
