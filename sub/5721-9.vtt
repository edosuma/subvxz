Ah... ah.

01:16.510 --> 01:21.118
[door closes]

01:21.160 --> 01:23.116
Let me know if I'm not in frame.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.853
I can move down.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.252
I'm not wearing a camera.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.460
Oh, how considerate.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.124
Let's skip
the hostility, please.

01:29.170 --> 01:32.082
She went out of her way to
make us look like bigots.

01:32.130 --> 01:33.381
I think I'm being pretty
friendly, considering.

01:33.440 --> 01:36.216
I can see you went
with diversity in hiring.

What can we do
for you, Monica?

01:40.620 --> 01:43.316
I can't imagine that
you're here to apologize.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.396
A friend of mine was
recently run out of busmess

01:45.450 --> 01:46.792
by a giant tech company.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.569
I'm bringing suit.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.235
And you don't have the resources
to pursue the case on your own?

01:51.280 --> 01:52.235
You said to call
ifI needed help.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.588
You've complicated
our relationship

01:53.630 --> 01:55.109
since I made that offer.
True.

01:55.150 --> 01:57.198
But at least we know we can
be direct with each other.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.458
Besides, it could be
good for your image.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.671
How?
The company
I'm suing is even

02:01.730 --> 02:03.721
more lacking
in diversity than yours.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.419
And what company is that?

02:05.470 --> 02:06.721
Chumhum.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.682
And you want us to help?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.550
Well, actually, I need Lucca
to help, but I know you two

02:11.600 --> 02:12.908
have this Bert
and Ernie thing going.

02:12.950 --> 02:16.169
Well, why me?

02:16.220 --> 02:18.996
Alicia's the one
that's worked with Chumhum.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.132
Well, it's a racism case.

02:21.180 --> 02:24.695
And, uh, my firm's
a little pale at the moment.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.615
What an honor.
My parents would be so proud.

02:26.660 --> 02:28.355
Who's suing?

02:28.400 --> 02:30.925
WOMAN: We used to book up
weeks in advance.

02:30.970 --> 02:33.052
Our venison pot pie was
written up in the Trib.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.624
We were Zagat rated.

02:34.670 --> 02:37.013
Then people just stopped coming.

02:37.060 --> 02:38.937
It's hard not to take it
personally when it's your baby.

02:38.980 --> 02:41.028
And why is Chumhum
responsible?

02:41.070 --> 02:44.324
Their maps program--
Chummy Maps--

02:44.380 --> 02:46.336
it's supposed to help
users stay safe

02:46.380 --> 02:47.938
by giving them directions

02:47.990 --> 02:50.720
to avoid the dangerous
parts of the city.

02:50.770 --> 02:52.726
Green's safe, yellow's so-so,

02:52.780 --> 02:54.862
and red means "stay away."

02:54.910 --> 02:56.866
When the filter's on,

02:56.910 --> 02:59.219
driving directions
avoid the red areas.

02:59.260 --> 03:01.694
The filter is always
on by default.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.867
You have to manually
turn it off.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.569
So you lost your foot traffic?

03:05.620 --> 03:06.689
And this--
watch when I

03:06.750 --> 03:08.877
toggle the filter on and off.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.650
MONICA:
It doesn't show businesses
in the red parts of the map.

was like I didn't exist.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.229
It says this is an unsafe area?

03:15.280 --> 03:17.578
Yes, a red zone.

03:19.630 --> 03:21.621
It doesn't feel unsafe.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.581
MONICA: Yes, except
for one thing.

03:23.630 --> 03:26.155
Too many people of color.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.508
MAN: _
Our maps are not racrst.

03:27.550 --> 03:29.768
It's run by an algorithm.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.983
And math is not racist.

Chumhum is very proud
of its diversity and openness.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.549
DIANE: And yet their
Safe Filter

deters people
from patronizing businesses

who respond to Its software.

It was Ms. Feldman's choice
to open a four-star restaurant

03:45.260 --> 03:46.818
in a marginal neighborhood,
not ours.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.132
It isn't a marginal
neighborhood,

03:48.180 --> 03:49.875
It's a black neighborhood.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.262
Well, it's both, which really

03:51.310 --> 03:53.961
isn't that uncommon.Wait, what?!

03:54.010 --> 03:55.523
Well, he's not saying
anything that unusual.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.878
Look at crime rates.
Look at home values.

03:57.930 --> 04:00.660
And look at the biracial lavwer
pimping for a racist system.

Are you actually saying--?

[all talking at once]

04:04.760 --> 04:05.977
Let's not make this personal,
guys. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:06.020 --> 04:07.282
Hey, wait.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.844
Chumhum will admit
no wrongdoing.

04:09.900 --> 04:13.768
But in the spirit of making
this world a better place,

04:13.810 --> 04:16.722
Mr. Harman is willing to
offer Ms. Feldman $50,000

04:16.770 --> 04:18.726
to open a new restaurant
anywhere she wants.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.293
Consider it a gesture.MONICA: What
gesture is that?

04:20.340 --> 04:21.466
The finger?

04:21.520 --> 04:24.216
Chumhum is worth 300 billion.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.693
I know how much my company
is worth, thank you.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.389
CARY: Is that because your
stock's dropped 22%

04:27.440 --> 04:29.123
since you became COO?

04:29.180 --> 04:30.477
HARMAN: Wow, seriously?Okay, Cary, you don't
need to go there.

04:30.530 --> 04:31.428
Want to fight dirty now?

04:31.480 --> 04:32.879
You know what?
You know what?

04:32.920 --> 04:34.046
No, we're done!

04:35.440 --> 04:36.702
Your guy's a piece of work.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.479
Unfortunately for you,
the law's on his side.

We'll see.

[scoffs]
No.

You just talked about her
for the last 30 minutes.

04:51.370 --> 04:52.712

04:52.770 --> 04:53.839
You have to be obsessed
with your candidate,

04:53.900 --> 04:55.026
or you're not doing your job.

04:55.070 --> 04:56.287
"Candidate"?

04:57.940 --> 05:01.421
Well, the question is
will the voters think

05:01.470 --> 05:03.813
she's still tainted
by her scandal?

05:12.830 --> 05:15.139
You're staring at me.
I can feel it.

05:15.180 --> 05:18.434
I can't help it.

05:18.490 --> 05:21.220
You are very sexy
when you're writing a check.

05:31.590 --> 05:34.753
See if you've resurrected
St. Alicia.

05:34.810 --> 05:37.028
ALICIA:
But above all else,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.061
I am a mother,
and it's as a mother

05:39.120 --> 05:42.419
I am asking for your support,
Webster City.

05:42.470 --> 05:45.371
I know ethanol can make
a difference for our children.

05:45.430 --> 05:48.388
So please remember,
a vote for Florrick

05:48.430 --> 05:50.739
is a vote for family.

05:50.780 --> 05:52.259
Really?

05:52.300 --> 05:53.779
I feel like I'm pandering
to housewives.

05:53.830 --> 05:54.865
Anyone who knows me will smell

05:54.910 --> 05:56.605
the bullcrap a mile away.

05:56.660 --> 05:57.866
Yes, but it's Iowa.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.433
All they smell is bullcrap.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.004
Look, these e-mail blasts

06:01.050 --> 06:02.438
aren't meant to be subtle.

06:02.490 --> 06:03.650
They're a sledgehammer.

06:03.710 --> 06:04.745
So don't pull back.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.667
Okay, what's
the next city?

06:06.710 --> 06:09.144

06:20.810 --> 06:21.981

06:22.030 --> 06:23.759

06:23.810 --> 06:25.812
Yeah, it just...
thanks.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.429
Hey.
Hi.

06:28.470 --> 06:29.687
What's wrong?

06:29.730 --> 06:32.551
Uh, nothing.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.859
All right,
so I have something to say.

06:37.910 --> 06:39.958
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.343
Now, we agreed that I would
stay freelance, right?

06:42.400 --> 06:43.697
Yes.

06:43.750 --> 06:44.785
That's how I keep
my fee low.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.229
And part of that

06:46.270 --> 06:48.704
freelance work has taken me

06:48.750 --> 06:49.876
to Lockhart/Agos.

06:49.930 --> 06:52.012
I know.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.312
Well, clearly
you have some

06:54.370 --> 06:56.713
hard feelings toward them,

06:56.760 --> 06:58.978
but, Alicia,

06:59.020 --> 07:02.023
I would never use

07:02.070 --> 07:03.412
information gleaned
from here--

07:03.460 --> 07:04.893
Oh, no I never
thought you would.

07:04.940 --> 07:07.670
But if you have some sort of
issue with this arrangement,

07:07.730 --> 07:09.413
then we should talk,
because I need to know

07:09.470 --> 07:13.076
whether I_ can
continue working here.

07:15.170 --> 07:18.037
I want you to work here.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.640
Even if freelancing
takes me to Lockhart/Agos?

07:20.700 --> 07:22.827
Yes.

07:22.870 --> 07:24.690
Good.

07:24.740 --> 07:27.823
I have something
for your motion to dismiss.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.745
Oh, I thought
you were gonna say

07:29.790 --> 07:32.224
you were going to Lockhart/Agos
for this case.

07:32.270 --> 07:33.441
No.

07:33.490 --> 07:35.276
Unless you want me to.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.275
No. Shut up.

07:36.320 --> 07:38.049
[both chuckle]

07:39.500 --> 07:41.149
Uh, here.

07:41.190 --> 07:42.145
[laughs]

07:42.200 --> 07:43.883
Thank you.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.840
JUDGE MARX:
You're suing Chumhum

07:45.900 --> 07:47.504
for tortious interference

07:47.550 --> 07:49.063
with prospective
economic advantage?

07:49.120 --> 07:52.157
Yes, Your Honor,
Chumhum's Safe Filter

07:52.210 --> 07:55.850
creates a racist geofencing
effect that disadvantages

07:55.910 --> 07:57.901
business owners in African-
AmerIcan neighborhoods.

07:57.950 --> 07:59.554
Your Honor, tortious
interference requires

07:59.600 --> 08:03.513
proof of either purposeful
or knowing interference.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.175
And there is none here.We believe there is, Your Honor.

08:06.220 --> 08:07.471
I'd like to call
a witness to show

08:07.530 --> 08:09.782
that the intent requirement
is not met.

08:09.830 --> 08:12.048
Mr. Harman, is it possible
for Chumhum's Safe Filter

08:12.100 --> 08:16.002
to have a racist intent?

08:16.060 --> 08:18.665
No, the filter is powered by two
things, and two things only:

08:18.710 --> 08:20.758
objective third party
statistics--

08:20.800 --> 08:22.495
uh, crime rates, for example--

08:22.540 --> 08:25.008
and user-generated
feedback data.

08:25.060 --> 08:26.618
Like comments and reviews?Yes, exactly.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.978
Which is entirely
in the users' hands.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.100
I mean, there's no way
that anyone at Chumhum

08:31.160 --> 08:32.980
could use a Safe Filter

08:33.030 --> 08:36.284
to purposefully interfere
with plaintiff's business?

08:36.340 --> 08:38.114
No, not even if we wanted to.Thank you.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.685
DIANE: Mr. Harman, is it
true that Chummy Maps

08:40.730 --> 08:44.427
is only available on cOS--
Chumhum's own operating system?

08:44.480 --> 08:45.640
Yes.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.032
This is a recent study done

08:47.090 --> 08:49.172
by the Internet
Research Foundation.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.040
Could you read

08:51.090 --> 08:52.603
what it says right there?

08:52.660 --> 08:55.265
Uh, "cOS users are 71%...

08:55.310 --> 08:57.266
Caucasian."

08:57.310 --> 08:59.392
DIANE: And what percentage of
cOS users are African-American?

08:59.450 --> 09:00.963
Does it say?

09:01.010 --> 09:01.999
Eleven percent.

09:02.060 --> 09:03.311
DIANE: And do these numbers

09:03.360 --> 09:05.749
match your own
market research?

09:05.800 --> 09:07.791
Chumhum is not to_ blame
for soqoeconomic disparity.

09:07.850 --> 09:10.193
Our products cost more because
they are better products.

09:10.240 --> 09:14.893
So you knew about the disparity
between white and black users?

09:14.940 --> 09:17.374
HARMAN: Again, our products
are not intentionally

09:17.420 --> 09:19.024
targeted toward
Caucasians.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.548
Yes, but if your
user-generated feedback data

09:21.600 --> 09:24.558
is being generated predominately
by white users,

09:24.600 --> 09:27.558
doesn't it follow that
the results will be skewed?

09:27.610 --> 09:29.384
Objection, speculation.JUDGE: Perhaps.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.159
And yet I'm still curious.

09:31.220 --> 09:32.608
HARMAN: Would the results
be skewed? No.

09:32.650 --> 09:34.129
DIANE: Really?
If you allow

09:34.180 --> 09:36.080
one racial group to
dominate a discussion

09:36.140 --> 09:37.823
about what neighborhood
is safe, you don't think

09:37.880 --> 09:40.178
the results will be skewed?ALICIA: Objection!

09:40.230 --> 09:41.618
Asked and answered.You're right.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.093
I'm just giving him
a chance to rethink.

09:43.140 --> 09:45.051
But it seems
he doesn't want to.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.658
Withdrawn.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.533
Purposeful
or knowing interference

09:51.590 --> 09:54.229
doesn't just mean
the defendant knew

09:54.280 --> 09:56.976
his product could
have a disparately

09:57.030 --> 09:58.418
racist effect.

09:58.460 --> 10:00.109
It also means...

10:00.160 --> 10:02.116
he should've known.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.149
We lost.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.075
Mr. Harman admits he knew

10:05.120 --> 10:06.200
their data was being generated

10:06.250 --> 10:07.592
primarily by Caucasians,

10:07.650 --> 10:10.164
so an argument can be made

10:10.210 --> 10:11.552
that he should have known

10:11.610 --> 10:12.816
what would result.

10:12.870 --> 10:14.861
Ms. Quinn, Mrs. Florrick,

10:14.910 --> 10:17.606
your motion
to dismiss is denied.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.479
Request full discovery,
Your Honor.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.043
Your Honor!

10:20.090 --> 10:22.229
Plaintiff is only asking
for full discovery

10:22.270 --> 10:24.659
in order to force us to settle.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.008
Poking around
all of Chumhum's products

10:27.060 --> 10:29.665
would compromise trade secrets.

10:29.710 --> 10:31.405
JUDGE: But you can't shut
them out entirely.

10:31.450 --> 10:33.361
I'm granting
the discovery motion

10:33.410 --> 10:34.968
and limiting it to items

10:35.020 --> 10:36.806
related to racist references

10:36.850 --> 10:38.010
and Chummy Maps.

10:41.070 --> 10:42.844
What do you think?

10:44.160 --> 10:45.502
Small.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.279
You don't get
claustrophobic in here?

10:47.340 --> 10:49.205
I'm actually
starting to like it.

10:49.250 --> 10:51.036
Yeah, Stockholm syndrome.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.638
I meant what do you think
about the focus group?

10:52.690 --> 10:54.681
You want to run her
for a senate seat?

10:54.740 --> 10:56.992
To start.Alicia Florrick.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.564
Wife of the Illinois governor?

10:58.610 --> 10:59.998
A woman who stood by her husband
during his worst moments.

11:02.090 --> 11:04.263
_Housewives-- _
Republican and Democratic.

11:04.310 --> 11:06.699
And independents.How large a sampling?

11:06.750 --> 11:09.093
Whatever I can get for $50,000.
But we have to have

11:09.140 --> 11:11.961
ironclad waivers. Nobody
can know we're doing this.

11:12.010 --> 11:14.092
Especially not Alicia.Why not Alicia?

11:14.150 --> 11:16.368
Because I'm using it
to convince her.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.139
[laughing]

11:18.190 --> 11:20.499
Yup, good old Eli.[phone rings]

11:20.540 --> 11:22.098
Yeah.

11:22.150 --> 11:23.799
What's wrong?

11:37.650 --> 11:40.210
Gina, could you come in here?

11:42.780 --> 11:44.304
Do we need the
Cone of Silence?

11:45.660 --> 11:47.878
Alicia and Jason Crouse.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.524
I have no idea what that means.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.709
_J_ason Crouse.
AliCia's investigator.

11:51.750 --> 11:53.058
I know who he is--

11:53.100 --> 11:55.261
Are they having an affair?

11:58.230 --> 12:00.278
No, of course not.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.493
No.He came by the apartment

12:02.540 --> 12:04.451
while I was filming
Alicia's Internet ads

12:04.500 --> 12:06.229
and she touched him.

12:06.290 --> 12:07.848
Touched him where?

12:07.900 --> 12:09.060
His arm.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.668
Like a massage?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.198
No, not like a massage.Then let it go.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.855
She touched his arm.
People touch each other's arms.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.039
She was smiling at him
like a schoolgirl, Eli.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.425
And not just in front of me--
in front of the whole crew.

12:24.350 --> 12:27.126
Eli, I want to be clear here.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.125
They were touching

12:29.180 --> 12:31.785
in front of strangers
with cameras.

12:31.830 --> 12:33.092
Okay, let me look into it.Now, we both know

12:33.140 --> 12:34.437
Peter's campaign
wouldn't withstand

12:34.490 --> 12:36.048
the fallout
of something like this.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.056
And Alicia's rehabilitation
would certainly

12:38.100 --> 12:40.489
become a wasted effort.Okay, let me handle it.

12:40.540 --> 12:42.223
Oh, Eli, you didn't even know!I said I'd handle it!

12:46.760 --> 12:49.228
[quietly]:
Oh, damn.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.768
ALICIA:
Judge Marx has ordered
limited discovery,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.869
confined to "racist references"
and "Chummy Maps."

13:06.910 --> 13:08.639
We'll split up
Chumhum hard drives

13:08.700 --> 13:09.769
and review all e-mails,

13:09.830 --> 13:11.650

and memorandums.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.009
Mar_k them as either _
responswe or nonresponswe.

13:14.050 --> 13:16.746
Uh, how narrowly are we
interpreting "responsive"?

13:16.790 --> 13:19.441
Well, don't want to do
the opposition any favors.

13:19.490 --> 13:22.186
Well, any disagreements,
we'll discuss.Good.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.221

13:39.680 --> 13:42.729
Away from you

13:44.170 --> 13:47.424
And I found

13:47.470 --> 13:51.509
A better way to do it

13:51.560 --> 13:54.996
And I've seen

13:55.050 --> 13:58.872
Some younger people happy

Happier than me.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.461
[song ends]Uh-oh.

14:26.510 --> 14:28.774
What?March 5 of this year:

14:28.820 --> 14:31.425
"Why do we include
home ownership rates?"

14:31.470 --> 14:32.425
In reference to...?

14:32.480 --> 14:33.868
There's no subject line,

14:33.910 --> 14:36.128
but it's in a thread
about the Safe Filter.

14:36.170 --> 14:37.819
Who to who?Chummy Map coder

14:41.700 --> 14:44.567
_ Damn. Ithink_
this one's responswe.

14:44.620 --> 14:45.917
But did they include
home ownership rates

14:45.970 --> 14:47.392
into the algorithm?

14:47.450 --> 14:48.394
No.

14:48.450 --> 14:50.406
So...?

14:50.450 --> 14:52.759
They were considering it.CANNING: So?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.052
They didn't do it.
Mark it as non-responsive.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.714
ALICIA [over phone]:
Come on.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.808
They discussed including
home ownership rates

14:58.850 --> 15:00.898
in the design
of Safe Filter.

15:00.940 --> 15:02.362
I mean,
that would automatically

15:02.420 --> 15:03.933
disadvantage
poorer neighborhoods.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.764
It's a prom for race.

15:05.810 --> 15:07.243
CANNING:
Yes, but, again, they didn't,

15:07.290 --> 15:08.723
and so it wasn't.

15:08.770 --> 15:12.683
Well... let's let the judge
rule on its relevance.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.288
Anyway, you sure you're not
misinterpreting this e-mail?

15:14.340 --> 15:15.739
It says,

15:15.780 --> 15:17.953
"Why do we include
home ownership rates?"

15:18.000 --> 15:19.558
H-How else
do we interpret that?

15:19.610 --> 15:21.953
Maybe the emphasis is on "we."

15:22.000 --> 15:23.956
"Why do wehave to be the ones
who have to do this?

15:24.010 --> 15:26.171
Why can't somebody else
to do it?"

15:26.220 --> 15:29.917

to find out what he meant.

We make our own.

15:39.190 --> 15:40.714
No, thanks.
We're good.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.718
So about those
home ownership statistics?

15:43.760 --> 15:44.977
Yeah, that was
just in beta.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.190
Uh, what was in beta?

15:46.240 --> 15:47.980
Our use of home
ownership stats.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.804
To determine which
neighborhoods were unsafe?Yeah,

15:49.860 --> 15:51.543
but only in beta.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.591
See, we had to show users
something on day one,

15:53.640 --> 15:55.369
before there was
any user feedback,

15:55.430 --> 15:57.990
so _we used other data
just to start it off.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.996
So what percentage
of the results

16:00.040 --> 16:01.735
is currently shaped
by user feedback?

16:01.780 --> 16:05.659
100%.
We realized that

16:05.700 --> 16:07.565
if we kept it completely
in the users' hands,

16:07.610 --> 16:11.137
we would avoid
another "Animal" incident.

16:11.180 --> 16:14.058
Okay, a what incident?

16:14.100 --> 16:15.829
Just something
that happened last year

16:15.880 --> 16:17.142
in the imaging department.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.055
We were this close
to causmg a major

16:19.100 --> 16:21.705
you-know-what storm.
I'll show you.Uh, no, no. No, no, no.

16:21.760 --> 16:22.749
I've got my computer...No, just stop.
It's okay.

16:22.800 --> 16:25.018
Stop.Well, we just can't

16:25.070 --> 16:26.753
pretend he didn't
say something.No, but he didn't

16:26.810 --> 16:29.768
say Chummy Maps.

16:29.810 --> 16:32.722
Um, does this thing that you
were about to show us...

16:32.770 --> 16:34.374
The "Animal" incident?Right.

16:34.420 --> 16:36.115
Does it have to do
with Chummy Maps?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.946
No, but we were all worried
we were gonna...

16:37.990 --> 16:41.596
Uh-uh, uh-uh.No, no... Don't
say anything else, okay?

16:41.650 --> 16:43.777
If it doesn't
have to do with the maps,

16:43.820 --> 16:45.378
then we don't
have to look at it.

16:45.430 --> 16:48.172
And we really
shouldn't look at it.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.706
What?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.149
Something
in the discovery?

17:01.190 --> 17:02.794
No. The reader comments

You think it's racist?Do you?

17:13.640 --> 17:16.803
He heard gunshots.
It's not racist.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.816
My guess is he thought
he heard gunshots.

17:18.860 --> 17:22.079
More discovery from
Chumhum. We'll take half.

17:22.120 --> 17:25.203
Oh, good.
Thank you.

17:25.260 --> 17:27.296
So...

17:27.350 --> 17:28.738
Biff and, um, Skippy

17:28.780 --> 17:29.951
are working out well for you?

17:32.310 --> 17:34.915
Yes, they are.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.428
And _how is that not
reverse raCIsm?How is what not--

17:37.490 --> 17:39.094
making fun of their names?Yeah,

17:39.140 --> 17:40.744
calling them
white stereotyped names.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.269
Is that what
Biff and Skippy are?

17:42.320 --> 17:45.699
Country club names from
some bad skit somewhere--

17:45.760 --> 17:47.534
polo outfits and tennis
racquets-- don't pretend

17:47.580 --> 17:49.275
like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.198
We don't want to be having
this conversation.

17:52.240 --> 17:55.027
We already are.Yes, reverse racism--
that dangerous

17:55.070 --> 17:57.937
contagion that's
taking hold of society.It doesn't have to be

17:57.980 --> 17:59.242
a contagion to be true.

18:00.940 --> 18:02.020
So how is is that
not reverse raCIsm?

18:02.080 --> 18:03.377
Because harm is necessary

18:03.430 --> 18:06.900
for racism to be... harmful.

18:06.950 --> 18:09.168
But you think they're idiots
because they're big white guys?

18:09.210 --> 18:10.814
No, I think
they're idiots

18:10.870 --> 18:12.428
because you hired them
instead of me.

19:18.110 --> 19:20.977
Girlfriend?
Kids?

19:21.020 --> 19:22.328
I've had girlfriends.

19:22.370 --> 19:23.928
Not had kids.

19:23.980 --> 19:25.857
I have a daughter.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.458
Divorced.

19:27.510 --> 19:29.068
Me, not my daughter.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.554
[forced chuckle]

19:33.520 --> 19:34.817
Sorry for my nosiness.

19:34.860 --> 19:36.464
I just like to
know about Alicia

19:36.520 --> 19:38.954
and her life.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.558
No problem.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.089
You know, they're
actually paying me now,

19:42.130 --> 19:43.688
so I'm gonna get back to work.

19:43.740 --> 19:44.911
She's getting
close to you.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.747
Isn't she?

19:51.790 --> 19:55.146
I think these are questions
for Alicia, not for me.

19:55.190 --> 19:58.148
You understand
why I ask?

19:58.190 --> 20:01.273
Her husband is
running for president.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.321
There's a lot more
attention being paid.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.805
I think these _ _
are questions for AliCia,

20:11.860 --> 20:13.851
not for me.

20:17.080 --> 20:19.071
Good talking to you.

20:23.910 --> 20:25.730
CARY:
The ads you're seeing are for
things you might like, right?

20:25.780 --> 20:28.123
Things you search for
or shop for online.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.909
That's right.And the ads you see

20:29.960 --> 20:32.918
are different from
the ads that I see?

20:32.970 --> 20:34.312
Yes, they are.LUCCA: Your Honor, the ads

20:34.360 --> 20:36.874
are just targeted.
Advertisers

20:36.930 --> 20:38.352
tell Chumhum
they want to reach people

20:38.410 --> 20:41.629
of a certain age, gender,
ethnic background,

20:41.670 --> 20:43.626
and Chumhum obliges.
That's nothing more

20:43.670 --> 20:46.537
than retailers wanting to reach
their customer base.

20:46.590 --> 20:48.285
Opposing counsel's
missing the point, Your Honor.Am I?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.410
Tell me.The point isn't that

20:49.460 --> 20:50.939
white people get white ads

20:50.980 --> 20:53.323
and black people
get black ads.

20:53.380 --> 20:54.984
Because you haven't made
that point.CARY: The point is the ads

20:55.030 --> 20:56.372
that appear
on Chummy Maps

20:56.420 --> 20:57.978
extract user data
from the entire

20:58.030 --> 20:58.985
Chumhum product suite--

20:59.040 --> 21:01.031
search engine, e-mails,

21:01.080 --> 21:03.901
chat sites, news feeds,
shopping-- all of it.DIANE: Chumhum

21:03.950 --> 21:05.292
is a fully integrated
platform.

21:05.350 --> 21:06.556
Therefore
our discovery shouldn't

21:06.610 --> 21:07.952
be limited
to Chummy Maps alone.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.173
It should include
all of Chumhum.

21:10.220 --> 21:13.439
Your Honor, that's
a hysterical escalation.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.528
It would be a ridiculous
amount of material.

21:15.570 --> 21:16.912
Good thing
we can handle it.

21:16.970 --> 21:19.188
To honor
your discovery ruling, judge,

21:19.230 --> 21:20.788
we must_
see everything.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.182
They're right,
Mrs. Florrick.

21:22.230 --> 21:24.881
Full discovery
of Chumhum is granted.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.579
[gavelbangs]

21:26.630 --> 21:28.621
Who's side is the law on again?

21:34.240 --> 21:36.549
[sighs wearily]

21:36.590 --> 21:39.115
Eli, I just had my ass
handed to me in court.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.333
I do not have the bandwidth
for any campaign talk.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.291
This is not about campaign talk.

21:43.340 --> 21:45.513
Okay.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.812
I know you want me to ask you

21:47.870 --> 21:49.292
why you are here, then.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.342
But I'm not going to.

21:52.390 --> 21:55.177
Jason is in your office,
working.

21:55.220 --> 21:56.562
Uh-huh.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.612
Seems like a nice guy.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.570
Uh-huh.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.611
He reminds me of...

22:05.230 --> 22:07.221
Actually, he doesn't
remind me of anyone.

22:07.280 --> 22:10.010
Very strong.

22:10.060 --> 22:12.233
Man of few words.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.714
Which is odd because most
of the people I deal with

22:14.760 --> 22:16.409
who you know...
use a lot of words.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.939
Yes.

22:17.980 --> 22:20.062
I've gotten over words.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.339
How'd you find Jason?

22:23.380 --> 22:26.986
Eli, what?
What?

22:27.040 --> 22:29.816
What are you after?
What are you trying to say?

22:29.870 --> 22:34.034
I know your private life
is none of my business...

22:34.090 --> 22:37.389
but when it begins to...
spill into your public life...

22:37.440 --> 22:39.396
You're telling me,

22:39.440 --> 22:42.568
when I sleep with Jason
you'd rather I kept it private?

22:44.310 --> 22:45.220
[wry laugh]

22:45.270 --> 22:47.397
You're joking... right?

22:47.450 --> 22:49.884
You're making fun of me?

22:52.410 --> 22:54.844
Okay, I think you
are making fun of me,

22:54.890 --> 22:56.403
but I still need to be clear.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.939
[clears his throat]

22:57.980 --> 22:59.368
This is the speech
I normally give

22:59.420 --> 23:01.581
to the candidate,
but I will adapt it for you.

23:01.640 --> 23:05.064
Luclq me.
Rule number one-: no
touching in public.

23:05.120 --> 23:06.849
Even

23:06.900 --> 23:09.027
If Jason is on fire,
let him burn.

23:09.080 --> 23:11.810
Touching in private--
no such thing.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.259
Nowhere is private anymore.

23:13.300 --> 23:14.813
Clearly.

23:14.870 --> 23:17.771
Rule number two-- if you have
to go out together, make sure

23:17.830 --> 23:20.082
there's always a third party
present, preferably female.

23:20.130 --> 23:23.258
Rule number three-- even if
you go out in a bigger group,

23:23.310 --> 23:27.041
never, under any circumstances,
let it be in a hotel, a bar...

23:29.270 --> 23:30.441
...or a hotel bar.

23:30.490 --> 23:32.879
Eli...

23:32.930 --> 23:35.797
you didn't talk about any
of this with Jason, did you?

23:35.840 --> 23:37.273
What?! No.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.537
Okay.

23:38.590 --> 23:40.535
This is the first and last time

23:40.590 --> 23:44.026
we discuss this.

23:44.070 --> 23:48.598
I'm notsleeping with
my investigator, but if I were,

23:48.640 --> 23:51.689
this conversation between us
could never take place.

23:51.730 --> 23:54.779
I would never let it take place.

23:54.820 --> 23:56.299
Please just tell me
you heard me.

23:56.340 --> 23:57.819
No, Eli,
I didn't hear you.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.167
I won't hear you.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.869
You can show yourself out.

24:08.830 --> 24:11.219
ALICIA: I'm notsleeping with
my investigator, but if I were,

24:11.270 --> 24:14.228
this conversation between us
could never take place.

24:14.270 --> 24:16.409
I would never
let it take place.

24:16.450 --> 24:18.224
ELI: Please just
tell me you heard me.

24:18.280 --> 24:19.759
ALICIA:
No, Eli, I didn't hear you.

24:19.800 --> 24:21.449
I won't hear you.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.968
You can show yourself out.

24:28.030 --> 24:32.148
Bad news-- they got
full discovery.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.634
Okay.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.203
New ball game.

24:36.250 --> 24:38.559
Yeah, a lot
tougher one.[outer door closes]

24:38.600 --> 24:40.295
You want a drink?

24:40.340 --> 24:42.069
I'm getting
better at it.

24:42.130 --> 24:44.166
No.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.347
But thanks.

24:46.390 --> 24:48.085
Everything okay?

24:48.130 --> 24:50.269
No.

24:50.310 --> 24:52.562
Full discovery.

24:52.620 --> 24:54.656
Oh, right.

24:54.710 --> 24:59.056
Well, maybe we're just
on the wrong side of this one.

24:59.100 --> 25:01.318
Maybe.

25:01.360 --> 25:03.362
I'll see you.

25:08.150 --> 25:11.711
CANNING:
The judge has granted
full discovery.

25:11.770 --> 25:15.069
Now, this complicates our job,
but it doesn't alter it.

25:15.120 --> 25:17.076
We still split up the materials.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.941
We still decide what is
responswe and what is not.

25:19.990 --> 25:23.335
Okay, so, go to it.

25:23.390 --> 25:26.348
We have a problem.Already?

25:26.390 --> 25:28.824
An e-mail to Chumhum
customer serwce.

25:28.870 --> 25:31.122
"Dear Chumhum, your
search results suck.

25:31.180 --> 25:32.568
"When I type in my name,

25:32.610 --> 25:34.339
"it auto-completes
to some seriously

25:34.400 --> 25:35.697
racist crap."

25:35.750 --> 25:37.832
What seriously racist crap?

25:37.880 --> 25:40.792
When he typed in
his name-- Jamal--

25:40.840 --> 25:42.660
the auto-complete offered
to finish the sentence

25:42.710 --> 25:45.349
with "Jamal stole my car," or

25:45.410 --> 25:46.661
"Jamal arrest record."

25:46.710 --> 25:48.268
Okay, that's not good.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.276
But it's non-responsive.ALICIA: Really?

25:50.330 --> 25:52.275
How do you figure?It's customer based. I mean,

25:52.330 --> 25:54.673
the auto-complete is based
on most used search requests,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.711
so, obviously, more people
who typed in "Jamal"

25:56.770 --> 25:59.807
were interested in arrest
reports than anything else.

25:59.860 --> 26:03.159
So, Chumhum's not racist...
its users are?Well, one could argue

26:03.210 --> 26:06.680
that it's racist
to override the results.Okay, we need

26:06.730 --> 26:08.379
to deal
with the "animal" incident.

26:08.430 --> 26:09.988
I don't like
the sound of that.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.770
Chumhum has
photo-identifying sobeare.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.047
It sorts your photos
into categories.

26:14.090 --> 26:16.604
Camping trip,
Disneyland, graduation.

26:16.660 --> 26:18.139
LUCCA:
One of the customers

26:18.180 --> 26:20.910
pointed out that it had
tagged photos of her friends.

26:24.930 --> 26:26.409
Oh.

26:26.450 --> 26:27.758
WOMAN:
Alicia Florrick was

26:27.800 --> 26:29.222
was willing
to forgive her husband

26:29.280 --> 26:30.793
when he stumbled.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.238
She deserves at least
that much understanding.

26:32.280 --> 26:33.622
And they put her
on that election board, right?

26:33.670 --> 26:34.887
They wouldn't have done that

26:34.940 --> 26:36.419
if she hadn't
turned herself around.

26:36.460 --> 26:38.018
The election board, sure.

26:38.070 --> 26:40.891
Is there anything
Mrs. Florrick has said

26:40.940 --> 26:45.411
or done that influences
your View of her?

26:45.470 --> 26:47.631
Her episode of
Mama's Homespun Cooking.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.555
It was so... raw.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.295
Like she's a real person,
with crap to deal with.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.126
Oh, this is good.

26:53.170 --> 26:54.694
All right, well, let's stay
on that topic for a minute...

26:54.740 --> 26:56.344
Yeah.NORA: Eli?

26:56.390 --> 26:58.085
I'll be right back.

26:58.130 --> 27:00.348
Real people who have to overcome
real issues in their life.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.209
Show of hands: How many of you
would value those qualities

27:02.270 --> 27:05.228
in a political candidate?I have a mission for you.

27:05.270 --> 27:07.704
A mission? Really?

27:07.750 --> 27:10.924
Sounds very...
mission-like.

27:10.970 --> 27:13.313
Actually, it is.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.792
Mr. Agos?

27:14.850 --> 27:16.624
Cary's fine.

27:16.670 --> 27:18.672
Cary. I was checking up
on the background

27:18.720 --> 27:21.029
of the coders over
at the Chicago Chumhum office.

27:21.070 --> 27:22.890
Which coders?
Kip O'Neill.

27:22.940 --> 27:24.760
The guy who created
the Safe Filter.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.118
I went through his
on-line postings.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.764
In 2013,

27:27.820 --> 27:30.209
a year before he created
the filter, he got mugged.

27:30.250 --> 27:33.208
He didn't say where, but he said
it was a "sketchy neighborhood."

27:33.260 --> 27:34.773
If he were mugged by...

27:34.820 --> 27:36.947
You can say it.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.774
If he were mugged
by African-American people,

27:38.830 --> 27:40.127
it's evidence _
he was raCIally motivated

27:40.180 --> 27:42.171
in the creation
of the filter.

27:42.220 --> 27:44.780
Good. Do we know if he was
mugged by African-Americans?

27:44.830 --> 27:46.786
No. I checked
for news reports. Nothing.

27:46.830 --> 27:48.878
Okay... That's
good work, Brian.

27:52.100 --> 27:53.704
Whew!

27:53.750 --> 27:56.401
That is pretty
good work by Biff,

27:56.450 --> 27:59.578
don't you think?

27:59.630 --> 28:01.678
MAN:
It's really not my team--

28:01.720 --> 28:03.369
imaging and tagging.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.024
I'll bring Josh over.

28:05.070 --> 28:07.504
Where's Jason? I thought
he was meeting us here.

28:07.550 --> 28:09.108
Oh, yeah, he called.

28:09.160 --> 28:12.152
He thought you might want
to limit his hours on this?

28:12.210 --> 28:13.689
KIP:
This is Josh.

28:13.730 --> 28:14.947
He can speak a little more

28:14.990 --> 28:17.129
specifically as
to, uh... yeah.

28:17.170 --> 28:20.469
Yeah. So... the photo
wasn't tagged by a person,

28:20.520 --> 28:22.249
it was tagged
by an algorithm.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.256
And the algorithm can't
tell the difference

28:24.310 --> 28:26.562
between an African-American
woman and an animal?

28:26.610 --> 28:29.738
Well, it can now, but, uh,

28:29.790 --> 28:33.578
three years ago, we hadn't
given it enough examples.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.793
It had real trouble
with light and shadow.

28:37.190 --> 28:39.499
It got a lot
of other stuff wrong, too.

28:39.540 --> 28:42.532
Just nothing else
that looked so...

28:42.590 --> 28:44.717
Racist?
Right.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.580
It's gotten better.
Google had this problem, too.

28:46.630 --> 28:47.892
ALICIA:
Did the algorithm

28:47.940 --> 28:50.192
ever mistake a white person
for an animal?

28:50.250 --> 28:52.411
Why would it do that?

28:52.460 --> 28:54.200
LUCCA:
Because it mistakes
white people for

28:54.250 --> 28:56.150
polar bears or white seals.

28:56.210 --> 28:57.939
[laughs]
No. Not so far.

28:57.990 --> 28:59.594
Why not?

28:59.650 --> 29:01.038
Why does it have trouble

29:01.080 --> 29:02.866
identifying
African-Americans,

29:02.910 --> 29:04.684
but not Caucasians?

29:04.740 --> 29:08.301
I guess because we hadn't
given it enough examples.

29:08.350 --> 29:09.829
We're not racists.

29:09.870 --> 29:11.394
I'm not saying you are.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.874
I'm just looking
around your workplace.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.654
ALICIA:
It's clearly responsive.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.666
CANNING:
I disagree.

29:19.710 --> 29:21.439
It's not racist. It's a
technical shortcoming.

29:21.490 --> 29:22.923
It's implicit bias.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.790
Look, no one at Chumhum
is actually racist.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.181
They just code what they know.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.753
That's why the tagging software

29:27.800 --> 29:29.324
never misidentifies white people

29:29.370 --> 29:30.849
as animals.

29:30.890 --> 29:32.414
The software has
been corrected.

29:32.460 --> 29:34.064
You yourself said no one
there is actually racist.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.724
This is non-responsive.
Click it.

29:38.550 --> 29:39.812
He's wrong.

29:39.860 --> 29:41.680
He's also paying our bills,

29:41.730 --> 29:43.641
so, I think we
have to click it.

29:43.690 --> 29:45.817
[door closes]

29:45.870 --> 29:50.512
[doorbell rings]

29:50.570 --> 29:52.822
Nora, hi. Eli's not here.

29:52.870 --> 29:54.565
I know.
The campaign sent me.

29:54.610 --> 29:56.521
They sent you? Why?

29:56.570 --> 29:58.219
In case you need anything.

29:58.270 --> 30:00.044
Oh. Well, I don't.
I'm fine.

30:00.100 --> 30:01.829
Oh, hey.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.529
Back to the grindstone?
Yeah.

30:03.580 --> 30:05.093
Tough boss.

30:06.580 --> 30:07.922
Cary Agos called.
He wants to meet.

30:07.980 --> 30:09.880
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe he wants to make a deal.

30:09.930 --> 30:12.979
Okay, give me second.No, he just asked for me.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.009
I'll call you.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.328
[thud]

30:17.380 --> 30:20.759
I'll just wait in a corner,
in case you need anything.

30:20.810 --> 30:22.949
Nora, I'm fine.
It's okay.

30:22.990 --> 30:25.072
I have a book.

30:27.730 --> 30:29.869
CARY:
Thanks for coming in, Lucca.

30:29.910 --> 30:31.901
Anything to settle this.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.471
We just found out one
of your coders, Kip O'Neill--

30:36.530 --> 30:38.600
he was mugged in 2013.

30:38.660 --> 30:40.878
I wanted to see
if you knew about this.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.876
This is why I'm here?

30:42.920 --> 30:45.184
Yes.

30:49.930 --> 30:53.058
He was mugged the year
before he created Safe Filter

30:53.110 --> 30:55.101
in what he called
"a sketchy neighborhood."

30:55.150 --> 30:56.492
Why call me?

30:56.550 --> 30:58.279
Why not Alicia?

30:58.330 --> 31:02.027
Ithought
you'd be more helpful.

31:06.080 --> 31:09.243
You're implying
the assailants were black?

31:09.300 --> 31:11.382
[laughing]:
I'm not implying anything.

31:11.430 --> 31:12.863
Ithought
you could ask your client.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.699
Next time,

31:17.740 --> 31:19.298
call Alicia, too.

31:19.350 --> 31:21.910
It just seems like something
both our sides would need

31:21.960 --> 31:24.133
to address if it turns out
to be race-related.

31:24.180 --> 31:26.876
Good-bye.

31:30.060 --> 31:32.221
It wasn't a negotiation.

31:32.280 --> 31:34.498
We might have a problem
with Kip O'Neill.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.758
Okay, I got it.
Jason's here.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.620
I'll ask him.

31:38.670 --> 31:40.718
Kip O'Neill
was mugged in 2013.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.455
It's on his profile page.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.718
We need to find out the race
of the culprits.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.988
All right.
I'll see what I can do.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.682
Jason, did Eli talk to you

31:50.730 --> 31:52.721
before, when you were here?

31:52.780 --> 31:55.294
Yup.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.422
About us?

31:57.480 --> 31:58.902
What do you mean, "us?"

32:00.480 --> 32:02.345
Us working together.

32:02.390 --> 32:05.086
Yes.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.965
I don't want...

32:10.010 --> 32:13.093
things to be uncomfortable
between us.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.142
Me, neither.
Well, then,
don't let Eli

32:15.190 --> 32:16.623
make them uncomfortable.

32:22.720 --> 32:25.188
Here's the thing:

32:26.680 --> 32:31.026
I used to have
a very different life.

32:31.070 --> 32:33.243
A very...

32:33.290 --> 32:36.851
uncomfortable life.

32:36.910 --> 32:39.640
I didn't like it.

32:39.690 --> 32:43.990
So now, there is nothing I do

32:44.040 --> 32:47.168
that makes me uncomfortable.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.438
Nothing.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.040
Even if I want something...

32:52.100 --> 32:52.998
[door opens]

32:53.050 --> 32:54.392
Is everything all right in here?

32:54.450 --> 32:57.089
Do you need anything?We're fine, Nora. Thank you.

33:01.060 --> 33:02.311
[door shuts]

33:02.370 --> 33:03.974
You said, "even if you
want something..."?

33:04.020 --> 33:05.362
Yeah, you know, that's...

33:05.410 --> 33:08.493
It's okay.Jason...

33:08.550 --> 33:11.064
look, I just,
I like things simple.

33:11.110 --> 33:14.022
All right? Work simple,
home simple, life simple.

33:14.070 --> 33:15.207
And isn't it?

33:15.250 --> 33:17.423
It was.

33:22.780 --> 33:25.214
I have to get back to work.

33:25.260 --> 33:27.216
I'll call you.

33:30.090 --> 33:31.569
[sighs intensely]

33:36.570 --> 33:38.094
How did we go from mugging
victim to possible racist?

33:38.140 --> 33:40.392
If the guys who mugged him
were black or Latino,

33:40.450 --> 33:42.748
Cary and Diane
will say racial bias

33:42.800 --> 33:44.665
was motivation
for the Safe Filter.

33:44.710 --> 33:46.234
So cynical.Here he is.

33:46.280 --> 33:48.532
CANNING: So?Good news.

33:48.590 --> 33:50.842
The attackers were white,
one was a redhead,

33:50.890 --> 33:54.633
so as long as that hasn't been
categorized as a new race...

33:54.680 --> 33:55.715
We dodged a bullet.

33:55.770 --> 33:57.249
JASON:
What do you get

33:57.290 --> 33:58.723
when you cross a black
and two Mexicans?

33:58.770 --> 34:00.897
Excuse me?It's a joke.

34:00.950 --> 34:02.554
Kip e-mailed it to his teammates

34:02.600 --> 34:04.465
four weeks before
they launched Chummy Maps.

34:04.520 --> 34:06.772
Which I'm guessing gives Diane

34:06.820 --> 34:07.775
and Cary their bias.

34:07.820 --> 34:08.809
Damn.

34:08.870 --> 34:09.825
KIP:
I'm not a racist.

34:09.870 --> 34:11.212
And I'm sure some

34:11.260 --> 34:13.433
of your best friends
are blacks and Mexicans.

34:13.480 --> 34:15.653
The joke was just me
breaking up the drudge work.

34:15.700 --> 34:17.088
Apparently, work around here
gets pretty drudgy.

34:17.140 --> 34:18.914
There are dozens
of these jokes here.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.700
Then you've seen
the white jokes, too.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.445
That... really
doesn't help, Kip.

34:22.490 --> 34:25.095
Look... we work
a hundred hours a week.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.539
We sleep on the floor here
half the nights.

34:27.580 --> 34:30.492
It was a meta joke--
a joke about joking.

34:30.540 --> 34:32.496
Like dead baby jokes.

34:32.540 --> 34:34.496
CANNI_NG:
So they were just a bunch

34:34.550 --> 34:36.893
of immature frat boys
blowing off steam.Pretty much.

34:36.940 --> 34:40.762
But it's gonna be hard
denying any knowledge
of racism to Judge Marx.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.244
You're right.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.248
Y... You're finally
agreeing with me.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.779
It's been known to happen,
Alicia.

34:47.820 --> 34:48.855
[sighs]:
Okay...

34:48.910 --> 34:50.775
then I will tag
every Chumhum e-mail

34:50.820 --> 34:52.128
with racist jokes "responsive."

34:52.170 --> 34:53.956
Not just e-mail.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.173
Tag every racist joke
on the Internet.

34:56.220 --> 34:59.565
I'm sure a Chumhum search will
turn up a billion Web pages.

34:59.610 --> 35:01.658
Just mark all "responsive."

35:01.700 --> 35:04.351
You're gonna bury the e-mails.Of course not.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.448
I'm just following
the judge's directives.

35:06.490 --> 35:09.095
DIANE: Thisis their discovery?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.879
50-terabyte hard drive.

35:10.930 --> 35:13.979
_ Picture all the contents
in the Library of Congress,

35:14.020 --> 35:15.976
and then multiply
that by five.

35:16.020 --> 35:17.976
Congratulations--
we've just been hit

35:18.020 --> 35:20.159
with what may be the
largest document dump

35:20.200 --> 35:22.452
in American legal history.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.240
Go away. What are
you doing here?

35:28.300 --> 35:30.109
You're supposed to
be with Alicia!No,

35:30.170 --> 35:31.159
I'm supposedto be working.

35:31.210 --> 35:33.075
That waswork.No, that was

35:33.130 --> 35:35.382
the most embarrassing thing
I've ever done, Eli.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.864
And I've done your laundry.Where are they now?

35:37.910 --> 35:39.605
Eli, they're not shtupping
at 11:00

35:39.650 --> 35:41.698
in the morning.Shh!

35:41.740 --> 35:43.526
Courtney can't know.

35:43.570 --> 35:45.481
You are a horrible employee.

35:45.530 --> 35:47.043
[quietly]:
And you're a monster.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.317
Yeah, uh... okay, yes,

35:48.360 --> 35:50.396
I'll-I'll see what I can do.Thank you so much.

35:50.450 --> 35:52.315
Mm-hmm.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.920
Everything all right?Yes.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.926
Can I call you later?

35:56.980 --> 35:58.709
About the PAC?

35:58.760 --> 36:00.978
About the PAC.

36:06.680 --> 36:09.069
RUTH: Eli.You rang?

36:09.120 --> 36:10.940
What's this?

36:10.990 --> 36:12.981
A file on Jason.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.985
Skeletons and such.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.769
Show it to Alicia.No.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.128
It won't work.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.728
You haven't read it.

36:19.780 --> 36:21.031
Alicia doesn't scare.

36:21.090 --> 36:22.990
Not when it comes to men.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.041
All women scare.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.261
Use it.

36:33.490 --> 36:35.048
Here he is again.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.749
What'd you find, Brian?

36:36.800 --> 36:38.222
I've been going
through the algorithms.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.180
I thought you were digging
through the discovery.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.140
Sometimes it's best
to look in the math.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.326
What'd you find?

36:43.370 --> 36:45.679
A patch-- pretty
crude, hastily done.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.062
I don't know what that means.

36:47.110 --> 36:48.896
It's embedded in the
photo-tagging software

36:48.940 --> 36:50.419
It was altered so
the word "animal"

36:50.460 --> 36:51.939
could never appear
in a photo tag.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.241
Why would they do that?

36:53.290 --> 36:55.201
To hide something?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.945
Plaintiff has a motion
to compel?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.251
DIANE:
We do.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.913
This, uh, photo shows
an African-American woman

37:08.960 --> 37:13.135
who was mistaken by Chumhum's
photo-tagging software

37:13.180 --> 37:15.136
and tagged as an "animal."

37:15.180 --> 37:16.522
Yes, it does.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.959
We discovered this photo
when we noticed a patch

37:20.020 --> 37:21.703
in Chumhum's
photo-tagging algorithm.

37:21.760 --> 37:23.887
A patch in
the software?

37:23.930 --> 37:26.319
So it wouldn't
happen again?Yes, but rather than...

37:26.370 --> 37:27.974
fix the underlying
problem,

37:28.020 --> 37:31.365
they simply... patched it
to prevent one instance

37:31.420 --> 37:34.025
of the problem from recurring.Was this included

37:34.070 --> 37:36.504
in discovery?We don't know, Your Honor.

37:36.550 --> 37:39.155
Chumhum's counsel
sent us 50 terabytes

37:39.210 --> 37:41.166
of discovery--
it will take my firm

37:41.210 --> 37:43.121
six years
to work through it.

37:43.170 --> 37:45.126
I see.

37:45.170 --> 37:47.730
Mrs. Florrick...

37:47.780 --> 37:50.305
did you include this photo
in discovery?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.526
No, Your Honor.Were you aware

37:53.570 --> 37:54.821
of the photo?

37:56.180 --> 37:57.704
We were, Your Honor,

37:57.750 --> 37:59.615
but we found it nonresponsive.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.264
Really?
So you found

38:01.320 --> 38:03.220
50 terabytes of data
responsive...

38:03.280 --> 38:06.443
but an African-American woman
being mistaken for an animal

38:06.500 --> 38:08.058
didn't make the cut?

38:08.110 --> 38:10.499
We believed it did not.No, you will provide

38:10.540 --> 38:13.065
all responsive documents to
plaintiff's attorneys today,

38:13.110 --> 38:15.419
andyou have been found
in contempt, ma'am.Your Honor,

38:15.460 --> 38:18.065
this was not my...You will pay $5,000

38:18.120 --> 38:20.202
to the Clerk of
the Circuit Court

38:20.250 --> 38:22.206
by end of day Friday,

38:22.250 --> 38:24.332
as well as any plaintiff's costs
and attorney's fees

38:24.380 --> 38:28.077
incurred in pursuing
this violation.

38:28.130 --> 38:30.291
And if there are any
more games like this,

38:30.350 --> 38:33.695
the sanctions will be doubled.
You understand?

38:33.740 --> 38:34.911
I do, Your Honor.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.302
[gavelbangs]

38:44.190 --> 38:46.135
[sighs]:
All right, look...

38:46.190 --> 38:48.966
you have any more questions,
you ask Alicia, all right?

38:49.020 --> 38:51.659
I'm a guest here.I don't have a question.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.494
Good.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.269
What's that?

38:55.330 --> 38:58.026
A file on you,
from the campaign.

38:58.070 --> 39:01.153
You serious?I'm not,

39:01.200 --> 39:02.542
but the campaign is.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.158
She knows all about my
criminal record.

39:04.210 --> 39:06.508
I don't pretend like
it doesn't exist.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.074
Take a look
at the back page.

39:11.260 --> 39:14.036
Does she know about that?

39:14.090 --> 39:16.729
Why are you
investigating Alicia?

39:16.780 --> 39:19.089
It's none of your business.

39:19.130 --> 39:21.269
Actually, that part is.

39:21.310 --> 39:24.609
I was going into business
with her.

39:24.660 --> 39:28.266
I wanted to know more
about my prospective employer.

39:29.320 --> 39:31.402
I don't believe you.

39:31.450 --> 39:33.577
And I seriously
don't give a damn.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.279
This stuff...

39:35.320 --> 39:38.619
this is yourlife,
it's not mine.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.410
Eli...

39:41.460 --> 39:44.372
do not make it mine.

39:48.290 --> 39:50.815
Now, get off my car.

39:52.120 --> 39:55.248
[car door opens, shuts;
siren walls in distance]

39:59.220 --> 40:01.950
Okay, we're listening.One: Effective 9:00 am.
this morning,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.742
Josh Shelby's employment
at Chumhum was terminated.

40:04.790 --> 40:07.042
The Photo Coder?Yes. Two:

40:07.100 --> 40:09.045
The Safe Filter has been
changed from a default setting

40:09.100 --> 40:11.568
to an opt-in--
users will have to activate it

40:11.620 --> 40:13.440
if they want to know
areas to avoid.

40:13.490 --> 40:15.799
And the business icons
should not be switched off.

40:15.840 --> 40:17.569
We agree.CARY: Fine.

40:17.630 --> 40:18.585
And how much you offer?

40:18.630 --> 40:19.972
Zero.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.454
We were under
the impre55ion

40:22.500 --> 40:24.365
this was
a settlement offer.

40:24.420 --> 40:25.978
These are Little Dokebi's

40:26.030 --> 40:26.974
financial records.

40:27.030 --> 40:28.372
The restaurant
was struggling.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.149
Ms. Fel_dman was
slashing costs

40:30.210 --> 40:32.599
almost as much as 35%

40:32.640 --> 40:34.688
because_business
was g0ing soft.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.595
She started doing this
two months...

40:36.650 --> 40:39.073
beforethe Safe Filter
went live.

40:39.130 --> 40:41.644
Restaurant business
101, Ms. Feldman--

40:41.700 --> 40:44.828
your business tanked because
you skimped on quality.Mr. Canning...

40:44.870 --> 40:47.043
That's not true.DIANE: How did you even get
these documents?

40:47.090 --> 40:50.048
Ms. Feldman stored them
on Chumhum's cloud-based
spreadsheet service.

40:50.090 --> 40:51.569
Which is private...Actually,

40:51.620 --> 40:53.224
users authorize Chumhum
total access

40:53.270 --> 40:55.261
when they agree
to the terms of service.

40:55.320 --> 40:59.017
It was a free service.

40:59.060 --> 41:02.052
Diwa probably wanted
to save some money.Mr. Canning...

41:02.110 --> 41:04.101
[others arguing]I have never skimped
in my life.

41:04.150 --> 41:07.449
[all talking at once]

41:09.070 --> 41:11.857
Sorry, but I'm not sure
what we can do.

41:11.900 --> 41:15.336
So your client isn't racist--
they're just omnipotent.

41:15.380 --> 41:17.632
Keeping us all safe.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.292
You want to celebrate?

41:21.340 --> 41:23.479
In what manner?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.909
In any manner you desire.

41:28.350 --> 41:30.739
[dance music blaring]

41:39.490 --> 41:41.481
So, is this your place?

41:43.190 --> 41:45.317
Let's go dance.

41:45.370 --> 41:48.066
I don't...
I don't really dance.

41:50.720 --> 41:52.506
Too bad.

41:57.030 --> 41:58.019
Whoo!

42:07.000 --> 42:09.423
Screw it.

42:20.050 --> 42:21.358
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.573
We need to talk
about Jason.No. No, we don't.

42:23.620 --> 42:24.962
He has a file on you.

42:25.020 --> 42:27.011
What does that mean?

42:27.060 --> 42:28.971
He has a personal
file on you.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.102
He has looked into your past.

42:40.990 --> 42:44.812
Doot-doot, doot-doot,
doot-doot, doot-doot. ..

42:44.860 --> 42:47.590
Doot-doot, doot-doot,
doot-doot, doot-doot

42:47.650 --> 42:50.904
Doot-doot, doot-doot,
doot-doot, doot-doot. ..

42:50.950 --> 42:54.169
Doot-doot, doot-doot,
doot-doot, doot-doot

42:54.220 --> 42:56.780
La-la la-la la-la, la...

43:01.440 --> 43:03.169
La-la la-la la-la, la

43:03.230 --> 43:05.004
La-la la-la la-la

43:05.060 --> 43:08.405
La... la-la, la, la, ah

43:08.450 --> 43:10.315
