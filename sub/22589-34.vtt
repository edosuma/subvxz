<i>NARRATOR".
When we last left the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:13.598 --> 00:19.771
<i>...Sandman, that notorious European criminal
recently arrived in Gotham City...</i>

00:19.938 --> 00:23.316
<i>...was preparing
to deliver a sleeping Robin...</i>

00:23.483 --> 00:25.443
<i>...into Catwoman's clutches.</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:28.488
<i>While Batman was tied to a mattress...</i>

00:28.655 --> 00:32.241
<i>...above which the wicked needle
of a button-stitching device...</i>

00:32.408 --> 00:34.953
<i>...was bearing down on him.</i>

00:35.411 --> 00:39.499
<i>For you, of course, some time has passed.</i>

00:39.666 --> 00:44.504
<i>For the Caped Crusaders, mere seconds.</i>

02:03.333 --> 02:05.335
The kid's waking up, Sandman.

02:05.501 --> 02:09.505
Yeah, prepare the patient
for a brief stethoscopic examination, Snooze.

02:09.672 --> 02:14.218
- Where's Batman? What have you done to him?
-I? Ha-ha-ha.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.012
It was you who did it, Caped Captive.

02:16.179 --> 02:19.891
At my command, you pressed the switch
which should have disposed of him by now.

02:20.058 --> 02:23.561
How ironic.
Batman button-stitched to death by Robin.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.480
You fiendish quack.

02:25.647 --> 02:27.857
To the medical eye, such childish claptrap...

02:28.024 --> 02:30.985
...means only one thing, young man,
you need some sleep.

02:34.656 --> 02:36.199
Well, we've liquidated Batman...

02:36.366 --> 02:39.952
...and Catwoman has her own little plan
for Robin's demise.

02:40.119 --> 02:42.330
A day's dirty work well done.

02:42.497 --> 02:45.625
- Take him out to the Batmobile.
-The Batmobile, Sandman?

02:45.792 --> 02:47.377
It's parked out in front.

02:47.543 --> 02:50.713
After I take him to the Catlair,
I shall dispose of the Batmobile...

02:50.880 --> 02:54.008
...then I'm sure J. Pauline Spaghetti
will be phoning frantically...

02:54.175 --> 02:57.053
...for another penthouse call
from Dr. Somnambula.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.690
Asleep? Lovely.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.567
Lovely.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.612
- What happened to Batman?
-Tell her.

03:56.779 --> 03:57.780
He's dead.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.198
Are you sure?

03:59.365 --> 04:01.409
I pushed the switch that killed him.

04:01.576 --> 04:03.494
Then you have a new assistant, Catwoman.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.247
Only as long as he remains asleep.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.709
Kitty, you know where to take him.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.546
Follow me, Robin.

04:14.172 --> 04:15.923
I'll join you shortly.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.385
I'm sure you'll find your next adventure
most amazing.

04:19.927 --> 04:24.390
Did your emphasis on "amazing"
have any particular significance?

04:24.557 --> 04:26.392
A play on words, Sandman.

04:26.559 --> 04:29.145
How did things go
with J. Pauline Spaghetti?

04:29.312 --> 04:33.733
It shouldn't be long before her entire fortune
is in my control, Catwoman.

04:33.900 --> 04:34.984
Your control?

04:36.778 --> 04:38.571
Our control.

04:38.738 --> 04:41.282
Now I must find someplace
to abandon the Batmobile...

04:41.449 --> 04:44.869
...and then return to J. Pauline's penthouse.

04:46.078 --> 04:48.331
For such a highly respected criminal...

04:48.498 --> 04:52.710
...there's something insidiously untrustworthy
about Sandman.

04:53.753 --> 05:00.551
Whereas he has only one life,
I wonder if he realizes that a cat has nine.

05:00.927 --> 05:03.596
With Batman and Robin out of the way,
all I have to do...

05:03.763 --> 05:07.892
...is to put J. Pauline Spaghetti to sleep again
and purloin that billion-dollar fortune.

05:08.059 --> 05:10.853
Purloin seems to be more
of a Catwoman word, Sandman.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.314
Never fear, in this Somnambulistic scheme...

05:13.481 --> 05:17.360
...l, Sandman, will have the last word,
which will be the word that counts.

05:18.945 --> 05:20.530
<i>NARRATOR".
What do we have here...</i>

05:20.696 --> 05:24.242
...in <i>the depths
of the newly-renovated catacombs?</i>

05:24.408 --> 05:25.743
<i>A</i> maze?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.371
What's this?

05:28.538 --> 05:31.582
Still asleep, Boy Wonder?

05:31.749 --> 05:34.460
I think he's waking up a little.

05:34.627 --> 05:37.171
Creep out softly, Kitty.

05:39.340 --> 05:40.842
Where am I?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.761
On the threshold of my maze.

05:43.928 --> 05:45.555
An enlarged version of the type...

05:45.721 --> 05:50.935
...in which scientific experiments
are carried out on rats and mice.

05:52.687 --> 05:57.650
You will notice that the entrance is here,
the exit here...

05:57.817 --> 05:59.861
...directly adjoining.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.154
However, once you start into it...

06:02.321 --> 06:07.034
...it may take you the rest of your life
before you get out of it, if then.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.663
Somewhere within the place,
my traitorous cat servant Catarina...

06:10.830 --> 06:13.374
...is hopelessly wandering. Ha, ha.

06:13.541 --> 06:18.337
Unless she's found the center of the maze.
In that case, she'll never return.

06:19.505 --> 06:23.050
- Ready?
-No, I'm not going into that maze.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.011
I'm wide awake now and I--

06:25.177 --> 06:29.557
This Catamizer contains deadly catasonic acid,
Boy Wonder.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.142
Which do you prefer?

06:31.559 --> 06:35.980
Taking a chance on getting out of the maze
in an hour, a week, a year...

06:36.147 --> 06:38.441
...or being catalyzed here
in a matter of seconds?

06:38.900 --> 06:40.276
Hmm?

07:02.131 --> 07:03.591
Holy voltage!

07:03.758 --> 07:05.259
<i>NARRATOR".
Set ad rift...</i>

07:05.426 --> 07:07.553
<i>...without the Boy Wonder or the Batmobile...</i>

07:07.720 --> 07:10.556
<i>...Batman courageously presses on.</i>

07:10.723 --> 07:12.850
Commissioner Gordon,
I know Robin too well...

07:13.017 --> 07:15.937
...to believe he'd ever betray me
and embrace a life of crime.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.065
I'm certain Sandman has turned him
into a sleepwalker.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.360
We must make every effort to find him.
I'll put every man behind it.

07:22.526 --> 07:24.987
No, commissioner,
I'll find him and Sandman.

07:25.154 --> 07:28.991
But in the meantime, J. Pauline Spaghetti
must have maximum protection.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.994
- The <i>billionaire noodle queen?
-I'll explain later.</i>

07:32.161 --> 07:36.207
Meanwhile, station all men you have available
in and around her penthouse suite.

07:36.374 --> 07:40.419
And above all, don't let her see
a certain Dr. Somnambula.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.046
Dr. Somnambula?

07:42.213 --> 07:44.340
I must get to the Batcave
as fast as possible.

07:44.507 --> 07:45.925
Let me send a police car.

07:46.092 --> 07:48.719
A needless waste of taxpayers' money,
commissioner.

07:48.886 --> 07:53.265
Gotham City's transit line
is the world's most rapid.

07:53.432 --> 07:54.892
Dr. Somnambula.

07:55.059 --> 07:58.604
Isn't that the name that phony Sleeping Beauty
mentioned on television?

07:58.771 --> 08:00.773
Yes, Chief O'Hara.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.943
And with Robin kidnapped,
the Batmobile missing...

08:04.110 --> 08:07.446
...J. Pauline Spaghetti
somehow in dire danger...

08:07.613 --> 08:11.033
...and both Catwoman and Sandman
deeply involved...

08:11.200 --> 08:15.621
...I've never said this before, Chief O'Hara,
but for once, it looks as if...

08:15.788 --> 08:18.374
...our side has fumbled the ball.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.801
Oh!

08:28.968 --> 08:31.637
You gave me quite a start, sir.
I didn't hear the Batmobile.

08:31.804 --> 08:34.724
I took the subway to Wayne Station
and Batwalked up the road.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.308
You-- But what happened?
Where is Master Robin?

08:37.476 --> 08:41.856
Both of them are still in the clutches
of that scheming sleepy hood, Sandman...

08:42.023 --> 08:45.192
...who barely missed
making a mattress out of me.

08:45.443 --> 08:47.028
If I may, sir.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.363
Sometimes I can't help wondering if--

08:49.530 --> 08:52.908
If the hazards of crime-fighting
are really worth the goal.

08:53.075 --> 08:56.120
That, Alfred, has never entered my mind.

08:56.287 --> 09:01.959
Perhaps the Batmobile Tracking Graph
can be of some help to us now.

09:02.126 --> 09:06.213
Let's just hope that wherever the Batmobile is,
Robin is.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.595
Aha. Good.

09:12.762 --> 09:17.516
The Batmobile is still transmitting
its location signal.

09:19.310 --> 09:20.519
Strange.

09:20.686 --> 09:24.523
It seems to be passing through
a run-down factory area.

09:28.986 --> 09:32.490
It won't be found too soon
in this run-down factory area.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.993
- What about Nap?
-He's right behind us in the pickup truck.

09:38.037 --> 09:40.998
It stopped.
I know that section of the city well.

09:41.165 --> 09:44.418
Derwin Alley.
It's surrounded by run-down factories.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.587
Perhaps a call
to Commissioner Gordon, sir?

09:46.754 --> 09:50.591
No, Alfred, the Batmobile
is my personal responsibility.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.761
And who knows
what might have happened to Robin?

09:53.928 --> 09:59.391
But there's no subway station
in that vicinity, nor a bus line.

09:59.558 --> 10:02.478
I could drive you down
in the Wayne limousine, sir.

10:02.645 --> 10:06.482
I couldn't drive the Batmobile back
as Bruce Wayne, Alfred.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.943
No. No, you couldn't.

10:09.568 --> 10:12.071
Let me take you in on the Alf-cycle, sir.

10:12.238 --> 10:15.282
I don't think we shall attract much attention.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.161
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

10:20.079 --> 10:23.165
Yes. A wise solution.

10:43.018 --> 10:46.147
That's funny,
that looks just like the Batmobile.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.233
All the new cars look alike this year.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.577
Maybe they all look alike to a rookie cop,
Reggie...

10:59.743 --> 11:03.080
...but when you've been on the force longer,
you'll see some difference.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.749
Registered to a guy named Batman, all right.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.751
With no street address.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.296
And he left the keys in the ignition.

11:10.462 --> 11:13.340
Two traffic violations right there.
Vehicle code numbers--

11:13.507 --> 11:15.676
It's not like Batman to do that.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.807
Here we are, sir.

11:22.057 --> 11:25.477
- Thank you for the lift, citizen.
-The least I could do, sir.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.570
Good work, officers.
I see you've found my car.

11:34.737 --> 11:35.779
Your car, bub?

11:36.572 --> 11:38.073
Got any identification?

11:38.240 --> 11:41.410
Reggie, this is Batman. I can vouch for it.

11:41.577 --> 11:45.664
Then you know your registration is incomplete
and you left your keys in the ignition.

11:45.831 --> 11:49.793
The Batmobile was stolen. No doubt the thief
didn't wanna get caught with the keys.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.462
Did you report it as stolen?

11:52.880 --> 11:55.007
- Not exactly.
- That's another violation.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.551
- Vehicle code number--
-Reggie, will you get off it?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.678
He's got pull with Gordon and O'Hara.

11:59.845 --> 12:02.973
Correction. I try to cooperate
with the police of Gotham City.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.392
I say impound the car and run him in.

12:06.936 --> 12:09.271
If you think that's your duty, officers.

12:09.438 --> 12:10.898
Let's get to work.

12:11.065 --> 12:13.567
Here's your keys, Batman.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.405
Thank you, officers.
I'll correct the oversights.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.325
Did either of you see Robin
when you found the Batmobile?

12:21.492 --> 12:25.579
- Who's Robin?
-Oh, you've really got a lot to learn, Reggie.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.054
Robin.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.431
Robin? Batman to Robin.

12:46.267 --> 12:50.145
But deep in the labyrinth
of Catwoman's maze...

12:50.312 --> 12:56.360
<i>...Robin, lost and confused,
doesn't know Batman is still alive.</i>

12:56.527 --> 13:00.364
<i>And also,
finds he's joined Policewoman Mooney...</i>

13:00.531 --> 13:05.869
...in <i>the inescapable center
of Catwoman's torturous trap.</i>

13:08.414 --> 13:11.458
Robin. Boy Wonder, what are you doing
in the center of this maze?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.585
It's a long story. Who are you? Catarina?

13:13.752 --> 13:16.797
Also, Policewoman Mooney.
Where's Batman?

13:17.548 --> 13:20.426
I'm afraid it's over for the Caped Crusader.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.469
And for me.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.055
- And for you too.
-No.

13:25.222 --> 13:29.393
- We got in here and there must be a way out.
-None, Robin. None.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.855
Holy rat trap!

13:37.109 --> 13:40.321
Purr-cisely, Boy Wonder, for both of you.

13:40.779 --> 13:45.409
And then when he gets his hands
on the Spaghetti billions, for Sandman.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.878
A patrol car in Derwin Alley, Batman?

13:56.045 --> 13:58.422
That must have been
Officers Hogan and Dietrick.

13:58.589 --> 14:00.758
<i>A credit to your department, commissioner.</i>

14:00.924 --> 14:04.386
One of them pointed out
three traffic violations on my part.

14:04.553 --> 14:06.930
I trust he didn't give you a ticket, Batman.

14:07.097 --> 14:10.809
The other one talked him out of it.
Rather unusual police procedure...

14:10.976 --> 14:12.728
...but under the circumstances...

14:13.062 --> 14:15.356
What are the circumstances?
Have you found Robin?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.940
No, nor Sandman either.

14:17.107 --> 14:20.069
Do you know if he's tried
to see J. Pauline Spaghetti again?

14:20.235 --> 14:23.072
Chief O'Hara is over there right now
with all the men that we can spare.

14:24.531 --> 14:28.243
Hold on a minute, Batman. That may be him
on my private phone right now.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.167
Yes?

14:35.334 --> 14:36.919
What?

14:37.169 --> 14:40.464
But how could Sandman walk into
J. Pauline Spaghetti's penthouse...

14:40.631 --> 14:43.008
...and spirit her out from under your nose?

14:43.175 --> 14:46.512
She said he was her savior
and demanded we let him in.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.765
It's hard keeping saviors out, commissioner.

14:49.932 --> 14:54.561
And then he looked at me and me men,
said we seemed a little peaked...

14:54.728 --> 14:57.773
...and the first thing I knew,
he had this stethoscope...

14:59.316 --> 15:02.694
What--? Hold on a minute, chief.
Commissioner Gordon.

15:02.861 --> 15:06.073
This is Tuthill, commissioner.
Gotham City Security Trust.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.324
<i>Yes, Mr. Tuthill?</i>

15:07.491 --> 15:10.619
I'm sorry to bother you,
but if you happen to hear from Batman...

15:10.786 --> 15:13.914
lt just so happens he's holding
on another telephone now. Why?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.749
A certain Dr. Somnambula--

15:15.916 --> 15:17.459
Dr. Somnambula?

15:17.626 --> 15:20.087
<i>Yes, Dr. Somnambula just told me...</i>

15:20.254 --> 15:24.216
...Batman might like to know
Catwoman's address, which he gave me.

15:24.383 --> 15:30.347
Uh, it's "Catacombs Condominium,
Subterranean Suite 6."

15:30.514 --> 15:32.516
What--? What did he want to see you about?

15:32.683 --> 15:35.727
He came into the bank an hour or so ago
with J. Pauline Spaghetti.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.272
- What <i>for?
- It's rather sweet, really.</i>

15:38.439 --> 15:41.483
It seems the billionaire noodle queen
and her doctor are eloping.

15:41.650 --> 15:45.320
She cashed a counter check for 200 million
just to see them through.

15:45.487 --> 15:47.114
Eloping? Where?

15:47.281 --> 15:50.534
They happened to mention
J. Pauline Spaghetti Island.

15:50.701 --> 15:54.538
Sentimental, isn't it?
The site of her first noodle factory.

15:54.705 --> 15:57.082
<i>It's grand larceny, that's what it is.</i>

15:57.249 --> 15:59.418
<i>Not to mention fraud, swindle...</i>

15:59.585 --> 16:02.921
...extortion, and a vicious and sinister plot.

16:03.547 --> 16:07.384
O'Hara. O'Hara.
Get back over here on the double.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.266
- Still there, Batman?
-Yes, commissioner.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.101
Brace yourself.

16:17.686 --> 16:20.522
How do I know
this isn't some kind of trick, Batman?

16:20.689 --> 16:23.108
It's no trick, Catwoman. It's the truth.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.737
How else would I have learned
the location of your Catlair?

16:26.904 --> 16:29.907
Sandman eloping with J. Pauline Spaghetti?

16:30.073 --> 16:33.660
And all those beautiful billions
I suspect you wanted to get your paws on.

16:33.827 --> 16:39.333
But there is one way he might be stopped
if I can count on your help.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.002
You can count on me for anything.

16:42.920 --> 16:46.590
To get even with that
two-faced continental traitor.

16:46.757 --> 16:48.467
Where's Robin?

16:48.926 --> 16:50.385
Who?

16:50.552 --> 16:52.095
Robin.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.057
Sandman said
that he delivered him here to you...

16:55.224 --> 16:58.143
...as a little souvenir of a quilting bee.

16:58.310 --> 17:01.271
Oh, Robin. Ha, ha.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.232
Ah, tsk, tsk, tsk.

17:03.398 --> 17:07.986
- Where is he, Catwoman?
-Oh, you're so strong and forceful, Batman.

17:08.153 --> 17:09.695
- And determined.
-Mm.

17:09.863 --> 17:13.909
If I can find Robin,
we can go to J. Pauline Spaghetti island--

17:14.076 --> 17:16.161
Your mouth is handsome
when you're angry...

17:16.328 --> 17:19.122
...and your eyes are so flashing...

17:19.289 --> 17:21.583
...under that mask.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.377
Where is he, Catwoman?

17:24.836 --> 17:27.631
And if I purr, so to speak?

17:27.798 --> 17:31.009
I'll testify that you cooperated,
the rest is up to the court.

17:31.176 --> 17:32.344
Ah.

17:32.678 --> 17:37.683
- Kitty, take Batman to my maze.
-Maze?

17:37.849 --> 17:41.103
You'll find Robin in the center of it,
if you find the center of it.

17:41.270 --> 17:47.859
Also that cunning oat servant, Catarina,
otherwise known as Policewoman Mooney.

17:48.026 --> 17:51.780
- This way, Batman.
-After you.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.744
<i>Came.</i>

17:58.495 --> 18:01.623
Pack at once. We're catching the first plane
to the Canary Islands.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.084
You just missed that plane, Catwoman.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.544
How did you get in here?

18:05.711 --> 18:10.173
Wherever there's a cat, Catwoman,
there's usually a back alley.

18:13.385 --> 18:17.306
<i>NARRATOR".
For the last time, what do we have here?</i>

18:17.472 --> 18:21.977
<i>Batman in and out
of Catwoman's amazing maze in no time...</i>

18:22.227 --> 18:25.022
<i>...back in the Batmobile with Robin.</i>

18:27.649 --> 18:31.028
<i>And away like dynamic flashes...</i>

18:33.822 --> 18:35.824
<i>...to the Batboat...</i>

18:43.040 --> 18:45.459
<i>...and J. Pauline Spaghetti Island.</i>

18:56.303 --> 18:59.556
You mean this is where it all began,
my dear J. Pauline?

18:59.723 --> 19:01.183
Oh, doctor dear, no.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.895
It started in a little shack
on the other side of the island.

19:05.062 --> 19:08.106
I used to raise my own wheat outside.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.442
Actually, this is where it all ended.

19:10.609 --> 19:14.738
Or at least my first husband ended here.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.406
Your first husband?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.408
Yes, J. Peter Spaghetti.

19:18.575 --> 19:21.703
He fell into a kneading machine.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.915
And my second husband,
J. Phineas Spaghetti...

19:25.082 --> 19:29.127
...he dried to death on a vermicelli tray.

19:29.294 --> 19:33.382
And my third husband,
J. Patrick Spaghetti...

19:34.341 --> 19:36.134
...cut.
-Cut?

19:36.301 --> 19:42.057
You know those revolving knives
that cut noodles into bite-size pieces?

19:42.974 --> 19:45.602
And J. Paul Spaghetti...

19:45.769 --> 19:48.605
...he stumbled into a steam cylinder.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.442
He expanded to three times his size.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.069
Not a bit pasty.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.865
Who is this for?

19:59.032 --> 20:04.579
Ah, heh. Oh, doctor dear,
a wise woman must look ahead.

20:04.746 --> 20:08.625
Oh, this factory
holds so many memories for me...

20:08.792 --> 20:11.712
...that's why I wanted to be married here.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.298
I'm so glad
that you brought the witnesses along.

20:16.091 --> 20:19.511
I wonder what's happened
to the minister I called.

20:19.678 --> 20:21.471
He probably stumbled into something.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.057
Shouldn't you lie down and rest
before the ceremony?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.601
Oh, for my fifth wedding day?

20:26.768 --> 20:30.772
Oh, no. I don't mind staying awake for that.

20:33.567 --> 20:34.860
Sandman.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.653
Look, the living mattress.

20:36.820 --> 20:37.988
You two again?

20:38.155 --> 20:39.740
Intruding as usual.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.701
Yes, Sandman. This little sleepwalk is over.

20:43.034 --> 20:44.953
Pardon me, dear lady.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.840
Sorry to interrupt your wedding,
Mrs. Spaghetti, but...

22:20.006 --> 22:22.175
Holy sedative. She's asleep.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.845
I don't think sedatives
had anything to do with it...

22:25.011 --> 22:31.184
...but she certainly
is blissfully, vertically, deeply asleep.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.938
Noodles.

22:40.569 --> 22:43.488
I wanna hear what happened to both of you
in the mountains.

22:43.655 --> 22:44.948
Really, I do.

22:45.115 --> 22:48.285
But I have been so involved
with a landscape architect...

22:48.451 --> 22:51.288
...who came up with a novel idea.

22:51.454 --> 22:54.374
A maze in the front garden.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.335
- A maze?
- Yes, Dick.

22:57.502 --> 23:02.173
Like they have in the gardens
of old European palaces.

23:02.340 --> 23:07.596
Now, ours would be constructed
on the hedge and alley system...

23:07.762 --> 23:12.267
...and planted with hornbeam
and holly and yew.

23:12.434 --> 23:16.229
- Lovely.
-Now, just think of the fun we'd have at parties.

23:16.396 --> 23:19.649
With our friends trying
to find their way to the center.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.943
Indeed, madam. Very tricky.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.362
Actually, not so tricky, Alfred.

23:24.529 --> 23:28.325
You see, most mazes
are based pretty much on the same pattern.

23:28.491 --> 23:32.704
Upon entering, you turn to your left. On the
first two occasions where you have a choice...

23:32.871 --> 23:37.042
...you keep right,
thereafter you keep to your left.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.210
Is that how you found--? I mean--

23:39.669 --> 23:42.881
- Uh, is that how it's done?
-Yes, that's how it's done, Dick.

23:43.048 --> 23:46.885
Of course, the garden mazes
do present problems, Aunt Harriet.

23:47.260 --> 23:48.887
Do they, Bruce?

23:49.054 --> 23:54.017
For some unknown reason,
they attract cats by the thousands.

23:54.184 --> 23:57.604
They're also strangely sleep-inducing...

23:57.771 --> 24:01.983
...undoubtedly due to the hypnotic effect
of the irregular pattern.

24:02.525 --> 24:03.902
Oh.

24:04.069 --> 24:07.781
Well, then, I'll go back to my original idea.

24:07.948 --> 24:09.491
A plain clover lawn.

24:10.408 --> 24:15.330
In the long run, Aunt Harriet,
I think that would be much more restful.
