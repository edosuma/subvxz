01:34.219 --> 01:35.682
You see what I'm saying?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.226
Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:37.306 --> 01:38.683
Pretty good?

01:38.765 --> 01:39.937
It's kind of slow.

01:41.226 --> 01:46.318
- What's slow? The flow's slow?
- No, the beat... is slow.

01:46.398 --> 01:50.197
It's minimal. There's a difference.
It's not overpowering the rhyme.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.154
All right, it's supporting the rhyme.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.616
That's what a good beat is all about.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.871
Well, I guess.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.999
- You feel me?
- It's got no hook.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.669
Get out of here with that no-hook shit.
This ain't pop.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.796
It's music right here, boy.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.798
- It's boring.
- Bor...

02:07.878 --> 02:10.842
- Go to your room. You grounded.
- For what?

02:10.922 --> 02:12.344
Because you like terrible music.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.676
You can't ground me for that.

02:13.759 --> 02:17.099
I can't? So you make the rules now?
Is that what I'm hearing?

02:19.306 --> 02:21.770
Stop making them noises with your mouth.
What is that?

02:22.550 --> 02:27.200
Oh, OK, you know what? I can't hear it,
because this sick-ass beat!

02:29.691 --> 02:31.693
Tell me you can't dance to that.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.448
You definitely can't dance to this.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.827
Double grounded.
Keep talking, and see what's up.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.539
Seriously, go to your room.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.311
All right, you're ungrounded.

03:05.394 --> 03:06.441
Let's go out.

03:07.979 --> 03:11.820
I think she put
the wrong flavor in my ice cream.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.153
But do you like it?

03:14.236 --> 03:15.988
- Yeah.
- So you win.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.410
You got a whole new flavor to like.

03:20.325 --> 03:22.664
But if I go back and I want it again,

03:22.744 --> 03:25.917
the problem is I don't know
what the name of the flavor is.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.250
Well, what did you order this time?

03:28.333 --> 03:32.338
- Vanilla.
- OK, so just say vanilla.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.938
Come on. Tell me more than just "nichts."

05:04.179 --> 05:05.305
OK...

05:10.143 --> 05:17.402
This... is a special activity program
for teenagers at the youth center.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.281
They have football.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.532
American football?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.701
No. Soccer.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.035
- They have...
- And you want me to go here?

05:26.117 --> 05:28.290
You can learn German with me,

05:28.370 --> 05:33.545
but you need to practice your German
with people your own age.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.796
Why?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.798
Because I said so.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.301
Because you can make friends.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.595
I don't need friends.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.098
Everybody needs friends, Morris.

05:45.428 --> 05:48.727
If you don't like it, you can blame me.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.270
I don't like it.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.615
# Yeah, yeah

06:46.698 --> 06:49.076
# Let me get some claps y'all, yeah, yeah

06:49.159 --> 06:51.331
# M to the motherfucking G in the house

06:51.411 --> 06:53.708
# Fucking all the bitches two at a time

06:53.788 --> 06:56.041
# All you can take for just 10. 99

06:56.124 --> 06:58.377
# Mom's on the pipe,
and Pop's on death row

06:58.460 --> 07:00.674
# So who gives a shit
if I fuck all these hos?

07:35.747 --> 07:37.624
Ja.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.495
Hey!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.207
Nah, I'm good.

08:57.287 --> 08:59.289
Ah, American.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.092
Hey.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.594
Kobe Bryant?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.388
No.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.148
Yeah.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.603
Morris.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.438
Morris. I'm Katrin.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.148
How old are you?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.113
Fifteen. How old are you?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.820
Fifteen.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.497
I don't think this is true.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.370
Fourteen.

10:59.450 --> 11:03.541
So where are you going,
14-year-old Morris from America?

11:03.621 --> 11:08.627
Oh, um... um...
I was going to see this castle.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.304
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.050
Why is that?

11:15.133 --> 11:19.764
Because I go this way to my house,
so we cannot walk together.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.934
Oh.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.766
So I'll see you another time.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.276
OK.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.163
This, I believe.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.328
Want me to do you next?

13:06.411 --> 13:09.751
Hell, no.
You messed my hairline up last time.

13:09.831 --> 13:13.881
So you don't want to walk around
looking fly for these German girls?

13:17.213 --> 13:20.011
Oh, I can't talk to you about girls now?

13:20.091 --> 13:21.638
Ain't no girls to talk about.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.681
First you get the hi-top fade.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.058
Then you get the girl.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.685
It's the first rule of the game, son.

13:29.726 --> 13:35.483
When I was out here playing,
and, uh, y'all were in the States,

13:35.565 --> 13:37.818
your mom did not trust German girls.

13:37.900 --> 13:42.155
She could trust me, but she could
not trust them German girls, man.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.911
She always thought they'd be after me.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.887
- Were they?
- Hell, no.

13:46.967 --> 13:49.037
Not even one.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.670
Oh, you know what?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.673
Stop for a second.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.217
Here.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.799
What's this?

14:00.882 --> 14:02.929
That was in the box your grandma sent.

14:03.009 --> 14:08.184
Just a hot rapper from the Bronx
around '93 freestyling.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.516
- Who?
- Me.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.523
That's funny?

14:13.603 --> 14:15.566
My own blood laughing at me.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.193
I should take it back.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.525
You used to rap?

14:18.608 --> 14:21.197
Man, don't sleep on your old man, son.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.866
I had sick flow with this freestyle shit.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.323
Probably still do.

14:25.406 --> 14:27.408
How am I supposed to play this?

14:27.492 --> 14:29.870
Gotta get you a boom box.

14:29.952 --> 14:33.832
Walk around the square bumping that,
blow these Germans' minds.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.340
- They still sell those?
- I have no idea.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.299
Maybe I'll find one in a museum.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.829
Hey, uh, I like... You see that boy?

15:12.954 --> 15:13.955
Ja.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.519
OK.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.347
Yo, Kobe Bryant!

17:36.889 --> 17:40.143
No food here, Kobe, so good-bye.

17:42.186 --> 17:46.152
Hey. You know, there is
a party under the bridge.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.905
- A body?
- A party.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.406
Oh, a party.

17:50.486 --> 17:51.782
You want to come?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.451
- Tonight?
- Tomorrow.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.455
I think you should come.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.665
Are you gonna be there?

18:01.747 --> 18:02.873
Ja.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.043
OK.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.004
Cool. Give me your phone.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.064
OK.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.296
..."inviting"?

19:28.376 --> 19:32.800
Inviting? Like in what sentence?

19:32.880 --> 19:37.181
Like, "Thank you for inviting me."

19:44.350 --> 19:46.897
- Are you invited to something?
- Maybe.

19:46.977 --> 19:50.901
I get invited to things all the time.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.825
How come you don't invite me?

19:54.485 --> 19:58.576
- Because you're old.
- I'm old?

19:58.656 --> 20:01.159
How old do you think I am?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.831
Mm, I don't know. 40?

20:03.911 --> 20:06.459
- Forty?
- Thirty-eight.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.793
Is this how you talk to all the ladies?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.703
Thirty-seven.

20:12.586 --> 20:16.927
You are a genius, Morris,
but you're not very charming.

20:17.007 --> 20:20.181
Man, forget charming.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.099
I'm gangsta.

20:22.179 --> 20:26.729
'Cause all the gangsters drink
hot chocolate with one marshmallow?

20:26.809 --> 20:29.982
One marshmallow is a gangster move.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.439
OK.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.824
Teach me how to be charming.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.828
I can teach you how to say, "charming."

20:42.241 --> 20:44.243
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Why?

20:44.326 --> 20:48.206
You want to take
an old lady like me out on a date?

20:48.289 --> 20:49.502
No.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.296
Good, 'cause I have one, yes.

20:52.376 --> 20:55.380
- What's his name?
- Lukas.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.760
Is he cool?

20:57.840 --> 21:02.596
He's pretty cool, yeah.
He's in New York, though.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.430
Where in New York?

21:04.513 --> 21:06.102
The West Village.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.853
Man, fuck the West Village.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.652
Language, please.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.691
I miss him. Hm.

21:14.774 --> 21:21.658
He's, uh, learning English there,
like you're learning German here.

21:21.739 --> 21:22.910
Cool.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.991
So...

21:45.262 --> 21:46.309
Hey.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.567
Morris Gentry.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.579
Uh...

22:31.308 --> 22:33.561
Hallo.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.690
Überraschen?

22:38.858 --> 22:40.610
Surprise.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.304
Hallo!

25:04.420 --> 25:05.466
Mo.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.423
You know what time it is?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.053
No.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.510
You have your phone?

25:10.592 --> 25:11.931
Yeah.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.224
So you have a clock. It's 12:30 A.M.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.227
Where you been?

25:18.142 --> 25:19.143
Nowhere.

25:22.104 --> 25:25.569
Morris, where have you been?

25:25.649 --> 25:28.739
I went to a party.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.947
You told me to make new friends.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.577
Yeah, make some friends, but let me know.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.621
Leave me a note.

25:35.701 --> 25:38.374
- I'm sorry.
- "Pop, going to a party."

25:38.454 --> 25:41.082
Boom. Easy. Five seconds.

25:41.165 --> 25:45.545
That way, I don't have to wait up all
night thinking about what kind of shit

25:45.627 --> 25:47.675
could be happening to you out there.

25:47.755 --> 25:50.258
This ain't Richmond no more.
You get that, right?

25:50.340 --> 25:52.012
Yeah, I get it, every fucking day!

25:52.092 --> 25:53.184
Hey!

25:54.678 --> 25:57.393
- All right, chill with that.
- I'll chill, too.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.060
Is that all?

26:02.686 --> 26:05.401
You pee your pants?

26:28.003 --> 26:29.380
Hey!

26:33.509 --> 26:34.761
Hey!

26:36.553 --> 26:38.100
Hey.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.019
You're mad at me?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.521
Come on. It was for fun.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.149
You were supposed to shoot me back.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.777
You know, I give you the gun,
and so you shoot me back.

26:48.857 --> 26:51.235
It's like a water fight.

26:51.985 --> 26:54.488
They don't have this in America?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.823
They do.

26:55.906 --> 26:59.536
OK, so you don't need to be mad at me.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.375
Look, you and your friends
just like to fuck with me.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.210
I get it.
Just a bunch of German dickheads.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.044
I'm not gonna sweat it.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.178
"German dickheads."

27:14.716 --> 27:17.094
I like this. So we are friends?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.476
We are not friends.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.853
Yes, I will show you that we are friends.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.271
How?

27:24.351 --> 27:25.522
I don't know.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.728
What do you want?

27:30.607 --> 27:32.484
Do you have a boom box?

27:32.568 --> 27:34.156
I don't know what this is.

27:34.236 --> 27:39.787
Something to play... this?

27:39.867 --> 27:41.413
Ah, yes.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.494
Come in.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.464
Sit down.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.970
# Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine

27:57.050 --> 27:58.388
# Hangin' pictures on my wall

27:58.468 --> 28:00.265
# Every Saturday, "Rap Attack"

28:00.345 --> 28:01.767
# Mr. Magic, Marley Marl

28:01.847 --> 28:03.811
# I let my tape rock till my tape pop

28:03.891 --> 28:06.644
# Smokin' weed in Bambu,
sippin' on private stock

28:06.727 --> 28:09.441
# Way back, when I had
the red and black lumberjack

28:09.521 --> 28:10.984
# With the hat to match

28:11.064 --> 28:13.817
# Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha

28:13.901 --> 28:16.115
# You never thought that hip-hop
would take it this far

28:16.195 --> 28:18.742
# Now I'm in the limelight
'cause I rap tight...

28:18.822 --> 28:20.369
That's my dad.

28:20.449 --> 28:24.540
No. Your dad is a rapper?

28:24.620 --> 28:30.627
No, not now,
but I guess he used to for fun.

28:34.379 --> 28:39.385
Nah. Those are not his rhymes.
That's Biggie.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.473
He's just...

28:41.553 --> 28:43.976
He's just rapping somebody else's shit.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.395
# I made the change from a common thief

28:46.475 --> 28:48.728
# To up close and personal
with Robin Leach

28:48.810 --> 28:50.062
# And I'm far from cheap

28:50.145 --> 28:52.022
# Smoke skunk with my peeps all day

28:52.105 --> 28:54.858
# Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way

28:56.068 --> 28:59.658
- Can you rap?
- Can I rap?

28:59.738 --> 29:02.617
Come on. Quit sleeping on me.

29:02.699 --> 29:07.124
I got sick flow, freestyle shit.
Know what I'm saying?

29:07.204 --> 29:08.706
Not at all.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.627
I'll show you sometime.

29:10.707 --> 29:12.709
I don't really listen to rap.

29:12.793 --> 29:14.464
Who do you listen to?

29:14.544 --> 29:17.093
Like techno and electro swing.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.850
I like to dance, you know?

29:24.304 --> 29:27.979
I hear black people are good dancers.
Is this true?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.774
Well, I don't really dance.

29:33.654 --> 29:37.112
You don't dance,
and you don't play basketball?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.819
So none of the sayings are true.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.404
# ...a one-room shack

29:40.487 --> 29:43.285
# Now my mom pimps the Ac
with minks on her back

29:43.365 --> 29:44.867
# Yeah, come on, come on

29:44.950 --> 29:46.121
Do you have a big dick?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.789
What?

29:47.869 --> 29:49.997
Is your dick big?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.671
I don't know.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.424
- Like this?
- Katrin!

30:03.760 --> 30:05.474
Hallo.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.062
# Birthdays was the worst days

30:10.142 --> 30:13.271
# Now we sip champagne when we thirsty

30:13.353 --> 30:15.150
# Damn right, I like the life I live

30:15.230 --> 30:17.983
# If you don't know, now you know, nigga

30:24.656 --> 30:26.745
- I should go.
- Don't worry about her.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.702
No. I really should go.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.384
Ahh!

31:25.467 --> 31:27.139
# Mo Dilla, the pimp, the hustla

31:27.219 --> 31:28.471
# The crook most scrilla

31:28.553 --> 31:29.766
# The classy ladies love to look

31:29.846 --> 31:32.269
What you doing up early on a Saturday?

31:32.349 --> 31:33.770
Just woke up.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.939
I feel that. What you want to do today?

31:36.019 --> 31:38.191
It is beautiful outside.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.193
I'm going to the youth center.

31:40.273 --> 31:41.650
What? For what?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.405
Hang out with my friends.

31:43.485 --> 31:46.950
Aw, friends? Look at you.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.703
Boy, you're making 'em faster than I am.

31:49.783 --> 31:52.247
Hanging out with friends.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.498
Going to parties.

31:53.578 --> 31:57.461
Slinging that big ol' dick around.
I see how it is.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.504
Why you gotta talk about my dick, Dad?

31:59.584 --> 32:01.173
'Cause if that thing gets any bigger,

32:01.253 --> 32:03.467
I'm gonna start charging it rent.
That's why.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.549
For real, though, what time
you going over there?

32:05.632 --> 32:07.471
You wanna see a movie or something first?

32:07.551 --> 32:09.514
I'm going right after I finish this.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.308
Well, shit, man. What am I supposed to do?

32:11.388 --> 32:13.641
You wanna drive me?

32:53.221 --> 32:55.098
Morris.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.774
Well, one of the younger kids

33:00.854 --> 33:03.607
found something in the back woods
and brought it to me.

33:06.276 --> 33:07.322
Marijuana.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.699
So?

33:09.779 --> 33:10.905
Is it yours?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.491
No.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.539
Did you give it to any of the other kids?

33:15.619 --> 33:17.917
Man, why don't you ask the other kids?

33:19.039 --> 33:20.666
OK.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.422
Asshole.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.571
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:47.651 --> 33:49.653
Yo, Big Mac!

33:54.366 --> 33:56.539
You have a talent?

33:59.913 --> 34:03.292
He can rap, freestyle shit.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.843
Rapper?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.849
OK.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.728
- I'm not doing that talent show.
- Why?

34:23.812 --> 34:25.025
I don't want to.

34:25.105 --> 34:27.233
- Are you scared?
- Nah.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.239
I just don't have anything
to prove to these people.

34:31.319 --> 34:33.196
German dickheads.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.664
I would like to see you rap.

34:46.001 --> 34:47.672
This'll be a good one.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.131
Weg.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.800
Are we done?

35:31.880 --> 35:35.760
Why? You have more important things to do?

35:36.176 --> 35:38.304
I gotta practice.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.397
No. There's a talent show tomorrow.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.731
And you're in it? Doing what?

35:48.813 --> 35:50.402
Hit it.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.406
Stop.

36:00.571 --> 36:02.002
Yeah.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.626
Let's go. Yeah, yeah.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.255
Come on. Yeah.

36:17.634 --> 36:19.807
I can't do it right now.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.686
It's OK.

36:27.352 --> 36:31.276
Hey, don't forget to ask
your dad to sign these off.

36:31.356 --> 36:34.610
- OK.
- Thank you.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.382
Uh-oh.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.729
Ooh-ee!

37:10.812 --> 37:12.525
See? I'm nimble with it.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.694
Uh-huh.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.151
Come on. What you got?

37:16.234 --> 37:20.284
Man... that ain't nothing.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.752
Mm.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.203
- Yeah!
- Well, congratulations.

37:27.287 --> 37:28.375
Uh-huh.

37:28.455 --> 37:31.049
# Unh, unh, unh

37:32.667 --> 37:36.422
Yeah. Um, it's not over
till the fat lady sings, OK?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.632
And let me just show you.

37:38.715 --> 37:41.554
Not only am I nimble, I am quick.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.352
I'll get it.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.775
Rematch.

37:49.809 --> 37:51.523
Your dancing messed it up.

37:56.483 --> 37:58.405
- Hi, Morris.
- Hello, Inka.

37:58.485 --> 38:02.325
- Uh, is your dad here?
- Yeah. Um...

38:02.405 --> 38:03.827
I gave him the forms.

38:03.907 --> 38:07.912
That's OK. Um,
I need to talk about something else.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.040
Excuse me.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.458
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.127
- Hi.
- Is something wrong?

38:12.207 --> 38:17.304
I was wondering if we
could talk for a second?

38:23.176 --> 38:25.304
Uh, go hang in your room, Mo.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.268
Good-bye.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.746
Ja.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.749
Oh.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.135
Ja.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.548
Und, um...

39:17.814 --> 39:19.441
You read through his book?

39:22.402 --> 39:27.118
He was telling me about a rap
he was gonna do at a talent show,

39:27.198 --> 39:30.577
so I read it. I'm sorry.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.082
It's a... It's a part of the curriculum

39:33.162 --> 39:38.338
to bond with the student and to...
look out for warning signs.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.090
Warning signs? Warning signs about what?

39:41.170 --> 39:46.427
Many things, like, uh,
misogyny and... or violence or...

39:46.509 --> 39:48.432
Does Mo seem violent to you?

39:49.888 --> 39:52.892
No, but this should...

39:52.974 --> 39:54.562
How 'bout this?

39:54.642 --> 39:57.816
You worry about Mo's German,
and that's it.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.360
I'll worry about Mo's everything else.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.192
- OK.
- OK?

40:02.275 --> 40:03.276
How's his German?

40:03.359 --> 40:04.656
- It's good.
- Good.

40:06.821 --> 40:10.041
- I'm gonna go then. Thank you.
- Wait a sec.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.380
If you want me to keep
signing these so you can graduate...

40:21.294 --> 40:25.515
I suggest... you mind your own business.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.138
OK.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.568
What'd she want?

40:41.648 --> 40:44.988
"Fucking all the bitches two at a time.

40:45.068 --> 40:48.618
All you can take for just 10.99."

40:50.323 --> 40:52.036
How does that hook go?

40:52.116 --> 40:54.539
Do it for me.

40:54.619 --> 40:55.871
Why?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.251
'Cause I said so.

41:01.501 --> 41:03.715
Fucking all the bitches two at a time.

41:03.795 --> 41:05.923
All you can take for just 10.99.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.177
Mom's on the pipe, and Pop's on death row,

41:08.257 --> 41:10.221
so who gives a shit
if I fuck all these hos?

41:10.301 --> 41:12.770
You ever fuck bitches two at a time?

41:13.805 --> 41:15.057
I'm asking.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.268
Have you ever fucked bitches
two at a time?

41:18.351 --> 41:19.397
No.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.275
- What?
- No.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.403
Why are you mad? You curse all the time.

41:25.483 --> 41:28.156
I ain't mad at you for writing
them rhymes because they're explicit.

41:28.236 --> 41:31.659
I'm mad at you for writing
those rhymes because they're bullshit.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.912
That's the best you got?

41:33.992 --> 41:35.705
I was just playing around.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.374
Let Snoop Dogg rap about
fucking bitches two at a time,

41:38.454 --> 41:40.793
'cause he's done that shit, OK?

41:40.873 --> 41:44.213
You need to be rap about what's
really goin' on with you. You feel me?

41:44.293 --> 41:47.297
So I should rap about
getting yelled at by you?

41:47.380 --> 41:48.882
Nobody want to hear that shit!

41:48.965 --> 41:51.012
Oh, you think you know
what people want to hear?

41:51.092 --> 41:55.433
Just like you think you know what
it's like to fuck two women at once?

41:55.513 --> 41:58.061
You don't know shit.
And until you know shit,

41:58.141 --> 42:01.105
you need to rap about
how you don't know shit,

42:01.185 --> 42:02.398
because that is garbage.

42:02.478 --> 42:04.025
At least my shit is original.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.231
What you mean?

42:05.314 --> 42:07.236
I listened to your tape.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.693
That's the real bullshit.

42:08.776 --> 42:09.777
You heard the tape?

42:09.861 --> 42:12.659
Yeah, and it's just you
rapping Biggie's rhymes.

42:12.739 --> 42:13.826
- What?
- Why do I wanna hear

42:13.906 --> 42:15.203
a tape of you rapping "Juicy"?

42:15.283 --> 42:16.996
'Cause that's a hot fucking song.

42:17.076 --> 42:19.040
And I probably killed
my own shit on side two.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.334
Hey, we are not done!

42:25.084 --> 42:26.631
Why do I have to hear about you

42:26.711 --> 42:30.051
being in a talent show
from some lady at my door?

42:30.131 --> 42:33.805
This isn't even for the talent show,
and it's not even finished yet.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.934
Well, finish it by writing some rhymes
from your brain and not your dick.

42:38.014 --> 42:41.018
You're 13 fucking years old!

42:46.647 --> 42:48.741
Yo, MC Big Mac.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.006
All right, let me get some claps, y'all.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.225
All right, no claps. OK.

44:10.773 --> 44:14.072
# Fuckin' all the bitches two at a time
All you can get for just 10.99...

44:18.781 --> 44:21.409
- I'm gonna kill you, Bastian!
- Hey!

44:25.830 --> 44:27.798
Thank you. You're finished!

44:31.586 --> 44:33.008
Hey! Hey!

44:35.464 --> 44:39.059
Let me go!

44:42.573 --> 44:44.190
What does that mean?

44:44.473 --> 44:46.475
Speak English!

44:46.559 --> 44:47.685
Hey!

44:49.020 --> 44:50.983
I like your freestyle.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.902
Thanks.

44:52.982 --> 44:56.532
Mr. Gangster. You want to get out of here?

44:59.906 --> 45:01.658
You're not doing a talent?

45:01.741 --> 45:04.369
My talent is leaving.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.588
- OK.
- OK.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.461
# So we go after your show

45:13.544 --> 45:15.007
# Don't say no

45:15.087 --> 45:16.509
Hell, nah.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.181
- Why do you live in Germany?
- My dad works here.

45:22.261 --> 45:23.979
He works for the soccer team.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.266
He's a player?

45:26.349 --> 45:30.565
No. He used to be a player,
but he's on the coaching staff.

45:30.645 --> 45:32.316
Really?

45:32.396 --> 45:35.775
But the team around here
is not very good, you know?

45:35.858 --> 45:39.448
Well, I still think it pays
better than in America.

45:39.528 --> 45:40.905
I don't know.

45:40.988 --> 45:44.618
He played here, so I guess he works here.

45:50.122 --> 45:53.251
Was your mom mad about me being over?

45:54.961 --> 45:56.048
Probably.

45:56.128 --> 45:58.847
I don't care. My mom is a bitch.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.769
Your mom's nice?

46:09.100 --> 46:11.603
Yeah, she's nice.

46:11.978 --> 46:13.104
Lucky.

46:14.230 --> 46:15.568
Hey, wanna hear an impression?

46:15.648 --> 46:18.362
What is an impression?

46:18.442 --> 46:22.538
- You know who Jay-Z is?
- He is married to Beyoncé.

46:25.658 --> 46:27.496
Yeah, it's ya boy.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.665
Jay to the izzo in the house.

46:29.745 --> 46:31.042
Hova!

46:31.122 --> 46:32.835
And this is like Jay-Z?

46:32.915 --> 46:35.880
- You don't know what he sounds like?
- Not really.

46:35.960 --> 46:39.715
Damn. That was a badass impression, too.

46:39.797 --> 46:41.174
You need to learn some Jay-Z.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.764
Here. Give me earbuds.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.934
No, for you.

46:48.014 --> 46:49.266
Oh.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.280
I like this.

46:59.358 --> 47:00.610
Yeah?

47:42.777 --> 47:45.992
Who was that guy you
left with the other day?

47:46.072 --> 47:47.660
What?

47:47.740 --> 47:48.911
The other day.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.955
You left with someone on a bike.

47:51.035 --> 47:54.500
Ah, Per. He's in university.

47:54.580 --> 47:57.459
He asked me to a party tomorrow night.

47:57.541 --> 47:58.793
You want to go?

48:00.336 --> 48:02.088
It will be fun.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.173
My friend Nadine brings Ecstasy.

48:05.883 --> 48:08.727
You know? We could all do it.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.559
I don't know.

48:14.683 --> 48:16.310
This is my stop. Good-bye.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.705
Ja?

52:13.088 --> 52:14.089
Ja.

53:26.662 --> 53:28.130
Mo!

53:32.251 --> 53:35.049
Mo, you in here?

53:35.129 --> 53:36.425
Got something for you.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.594
Peace offering.

53:38.674 --> 53:39.887
Mo, pull your...

53:39.967 --> 53:41.890
Put your pants on. I'm coming in, man.

53:44.263 --> 53:45.435
Huh.

55:25.321 --> 55:26.785
I wish you were here.

55:26.865 --> 55:28.959
Shit's starting to get real.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.230
Hallo?

56:01.358 --> 56:03.655
Curt... Ahem. Carlos.

56:03.735 --> 56:05.863
Carlos? Mm.

56:12.995 --> 56:13.996
America?

56:14.079 --> 56:15.831
Do you want me to speak English?

56:15.914 --> 56:18.504
No, no, no. I want you to speak German.

56:18.584 --> 56:19.801
OK.

56:27.467 --> 56:29.265
Um...

56:30.554 --> 56:31.680
I'm not sure.

56:47.571 --> 56:51.041
Uh, no, not really.

56:57.331 --> 56:59.333
OK.

57:34.826 --> 57:36.703
I think I'm gonna bounce.

57:36.787 --> 57:38.750
- Bounce?
- Leave.

57:38.830 --> 57:40.419
Why?

57:40.499 --> 57:42.462
I'm not feeling great.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.631
I'm not ready to leave.

57:44.711 --> 57:47.840
Well, I am. I got a headache.

57:47.923 --> 57:49.675
Let's dance.

57:49.758 --> 57:52.728
- Nah. Nah. I don't want to. No.
- Come on.

57:55.305 --> 57:56.397
I don't dance.

57:58.350 --> 57:59.567
No. No.

58:01.603 --> 58:03.591
- All right. All right.
- Yes.

59:56.051 --> 59:58.348
A few classmates were there.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.055
It was good.

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:01.935
Cool.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:05.689
The best part of the party, though,
was when these two kids started dancing.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:08.567
They were good. They were, like,
in the middle of the room.

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:12.993
They were dancing like
no one was watching, like this.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:19.578
Have you ever seen anybody
dance like this, Morris?

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.997
Are you gonna fucking snitch on me again?

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:24.500
What did I say? Language.

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:34.135
Here.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:44.017
I'm not gonna snitch on you again.

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:47.524
OK? I understand it's none of my business.

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:53.528
But I wanna tell you something.
You are young.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:57.949
Believe it or not, you are young,
and there's no rush to be old.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.201
Trust me.

01:00:59.281 --> 01:01:01.828
Nobody dances like you at these parties.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:05.457
You know? They all dance boring.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:08.210
Now don't rush to be boring.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:09.667
Be young.

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:12.214
Be you.

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:14.046
OK.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.632
You make a very cute couple.

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:18.011
We're not a couple.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.139
'Cause you're single and unattached?

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.016
I'm not a player. I just crush a lot.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.723
What?

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.726
Nothing.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:31.274
Doctor, they're chasing us.

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.026
Hmm.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.695
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:39.032
What you watching?

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.204
TV.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:43.833
How was the movie last night?

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:46.540
Fine.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.835
I was thinking maybe we
could go to one together.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:52.634
I don't know if they, uh...

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.305
Hey. I don't know what's
going on with you, man,

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.513
but, um, we need to talk.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:06.223
I know you got banned
from the youth center.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:08.525
Why you out here causing trouble?

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:13.650
I didn't do anything!
Those people were out for me!

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.778
I believe that could be true.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.161
So believe it.

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.537
All right.

01:02:25.617 --> 01:02:27.745
You're saying it to my face,
so I believe it.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:30.500
But just know it won't take much
for some people out here

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.545
to give you some serious shit.
You understand what I'm saying?

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:37.424
- So don't be out here looking for it.
- I'm not looking for it.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.882
I gotta go out of town, to Berlin.

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:43.219
I'll be gone overnight.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:44.890
I know I told you I wouldn't be traveling

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.223
until the season started,
but I have to go. I'm sorry.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:50.103
But you been acting like
a real big man around here lately,

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:52.397
so I'm gonna treat you like a big man, OK?

01:02:52.477 --> 01:02:54.900
You think you can handle
being here by yourself?

01:02:56.147 --> 01:02:57.986
Here by myself all day.

01:02:58.066 --> 01:02:59.154
I'm serious.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.362
I trust you.

01:03:01.444 --> 01:03:03.071
OK.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.122
My man.

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:21.301
Katrin.

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.382
Oh.

01:03:27.345 --> 01:03:30.310
- Hey.
- Were you texting me?

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.017
Uh, no. Per.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.773
Oh, because I lost my phone at the party.

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:37.025
No. Per's DJing in Frankfurt tonight.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:39.358
- Per's a DJ?
- Yes.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:40.909
What's his DJ name?

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:44.324
- Per.
- Well...

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:47.783
I was gonna see if you
wanted to chill tonight.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:50.455
Uh, no. I have to go.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:54.165
It's a big show, opening for a U.K. band.

01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:58.213
But, uh, you can come as well if you want.

01:03:58.293 --> 01:04:00.006
Nah.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:03.927
It's not far. They play the show
tonight, and we come back tomorrow.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:06.680
Nah. I can't just leave town like that.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.306
You will get in trouble?

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:12.435
No, it's just I don't
have a phone or any money.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:17.482
Ah, I understand. You are boring.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:20.691
Well, if I'm boring,
why do you even want me to come?

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.993
You are also funny.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:24.820
Hey!

01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.246
What did he say?

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:37.549
He said,
"I play the flute, and I'm stupid."

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:16.791
So I hear you're wanted by the cops?

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:18.498
Nah.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:22.461
He's a gangster, gangster rapper.

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.296
Oh, you rap?

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:25.756
- No.
- Yes.

01:05:25.839 --> 01:05:28.092
No. Not for real.

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.349
I still need to see you rap.

01:05:49.696 --> 01:05:51.073
What was that?

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.408
A surprise.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.037
Ah, no. Mm-mmm.

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:57.246
Last time you had a surprise for me,
I ended up with a wet dick.

01:06:02.709 --> 01:06:04.255
Chuck Morris, It's me.

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:05.924
Tried the cell ﬁrst,
but you didn't answer.

01:06:06.004 --> 01:06:07.300
Hope everything is cool.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:09.132
I'm bored in my hotel room,
and all they got

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.343
on the TV is Fatal Attraction, dubbed.

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:13.014
You probably don't even know what that is.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.557
You better not, actually.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:17.732
Anyway, give me a call
so I don't worry. Peace!

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:13.700
What does that mean?

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.704
In five minutes,
you will go out and rap, freestyle shit.

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.912
- What?!
- Surprise.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.871
Hell, nah! I'm not going out there.

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:24.959
Why? You can finish from the talent show.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:27.843
- Fuck that.
- What?

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:35.098
Feel dizzy as shit.

01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:40.148
I want to see you rap.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:01.998
# Popping off like
E pills and busted glocks

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:04.706
# America to Germany, it doesn't stop

01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:07.253
# Like Notorious BIG, young and glorious

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:10.837
# Pops gave me shit,
but I ride for him till the story ends

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.684
M to the motherfucking G.

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:22.515
All right, I'll do it.

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.352
- Yes! I think you go now!
- Now?

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:56.261
# Popping off like E pills,
and busted glocks

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:58.930
# America to Germany, it doesn't stop

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.723
# Screaming, "Muthafuck the cops"

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.642
# I love my pops, but a young'n is grown

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.850
# It's time to get it,
rockin' Mikes like Lennox

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.104
# Spit sick like diabetics

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.772
# Flow wild as the calico

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.816
# Straight from the underground,
fuck your talent show

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:11.109
# My talent improbable

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:13.152
# I'm everything they say I am

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:15.484
# Morris in Germany,
surviving any way I can

01:09:15.568 --> 01:09:16.781
# Bringing Germany that blackout

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:18.448
# Dope like a crack house

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.907
# Serving up these rhymes
like alcohol at a frat house

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.037
# I ain't a player,
but the hottest girl crushing

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:26.082
# More potent than
the cannabis she hitting

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.457
# Then the man she think digging

01:09:27.537 --> 01:09:29.085
# I'm the man, you see me spitting

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.712
# I'm like Notorious BIG,
young and glorious

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.130
# My pops give me shit

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.712
# But I ride for him till the story ends

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:34.921
# His soccer game tight

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.216
# So you know I kick it right

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:38.011
# When I grip the mic,
Morris Gentry kicks it nice

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.054
# On some other shit on another level

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:41.805
# How I rip raps, bitches on my dick

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.474
# I tell 'em all to call me Big Mac

01:09:43.554 --> 01:09:44.892
# Big black with a big sac

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:46.394
# Hey, girl, holla at me

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.100
# I'll show you where this kid's at

01:09:48.184 --> 01:09:49.810
# Heads up, 'cause we dropping some shit

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:57.614
# Uh-oh, heads up,
'cause we dropping some shit

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:06.497
Give it up! Give it up for my man Morris!

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.164
Yeah!

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:16.174
- My God! Did you see that shit?
- It was so great!

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.842
# Feeling so up and down

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.719
# Feeling down

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:21.801
# Feel the shoulders

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.852
# What can I do?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.649
# We can be

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.106
# Feel the rhymes

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:34.188
# Up and down

01:10:34.272 --> 01:10:35.860
# Feeling down

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.193
# Feel the shoulders

01:10:38.276 --> 01:10:39.989
# What can I do?

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:43.826
# We can be

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:49.504
# The everything you need

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:58.506
# Everything you need

# Every day, you will say

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:09.057
# Here we are

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:13.520
# I can say that I feel good

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:17.190
# Like men say

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:22.029
# Everything you need

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:24.947
So...

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.722
Come here.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.144
Oh, Morris.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:59.400
You will be OK sleeping
in the other room with Franz?

01:12:01.484 --> 01:12:03.448
Good night, Mr. Gangster.

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:05.366
Close the door, yeah?

01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.083
Ooh, ja.

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:21.799
- Katrin.
- Morris?

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:22.880
Hey.

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.300
Don't touch me!

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:37.023
Per!

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.507
I'm sorry.

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.140
He was nice to you.

01:14:41.769 --> 01:14:45.443
So did they say if they were coming back?

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:49.113
Mm, I don't know.
I woke up, and they were gone.

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:50.820
You were in my bathtub.

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:57.368
So they might have
gone back to Heidelberg?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.749
Heidelberg?

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.917
No, definitely not.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:05.252
Um, they maybe went to Stuttgart.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.961
That's where they play tonight.

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:08.257
Stuttgart?

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.305
Yeah. You didn't get the tour schedule?

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:16.137
What was your job at the tour, anyway?

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.014
Just hanging.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:23.277
Rock-'n'-roll.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.659
Inka Meinart.

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:18.911
- It's Morris.
- Morris?

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.330
Your number came up unlisted.

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:23.749
Yeah. I'm at a pay phone.

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.206
I'm in Frankfurt.

01:16:25.289 --> 01:16:27.003
In... You're in Frankfurt?

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:32.174
Look, I'm sorry to ask this,
but can you pick me up?

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:36.345
What happened? Are you OK?

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:41.225
Everything is straight, but, um,
I just got stranded here, and...

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.227
I just need a ride.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:47.187
OK. Uh, do you want me to call your dad?

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:48.941
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.610
Um, I already called him.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:52.862
He's in Berlin.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:56.822
He asked me to call you.
Everything is cool.

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.531
I just need a ride.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:02.913
Um, well, it's gonna take me
a while to get there.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:06.917
So, just where are you?

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.546
I'm at...

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:12.590
Dornbusch.

01:17:12.670 --> 01:17:14.672
- All right. Stay there.
- OK.

01:17:16.966 --> 01:17:18.343
Thanks.

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.813
Where's your cell phone?

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.526
It was stolen.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.662
You get roughed up?

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:32.167
Last time I was in Frankfurt was 2001.

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.797
You know, your mom was studying in Munich,

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.551
and I was still in the Bronx,
but I flew out to visit her.

01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:42.886
Cost me a fortune, and I had
never been out the country before.

01:18:42.968 --> 01:18:46.433
I didn't know any German.
I didn't know shit.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:49.603
I didn't even know
your mom for three months,

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:51.147
so it was like...

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:54.356
It was a crazy thing to do.

01:18:54.438 --> 01:18:59.069
But I wanted to surprise her.
You know, real baller move.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:05.703
But when I got to the airport...
I couldn't understand anything,

01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:08.912
where to go, what the signs said, nothing.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:12.585
So this British couple
that was on my flight

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:16.630
told me how to get to the university,
and they bought my bus pass.

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.300
I didn't even ask them to do that.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:23.635
But I get to the university,
and I find out that she and her class

01:19:23.717 --> 01:19:26.971
had all gone to Frankfurt for the weekend.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.933
Frankfurt? Where the hell is Frankfurt?

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:35.357
Again, this nice couple
I met at the university

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.902
told me how to get to Frankfurt.

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:42.613
They said they were going that way,
and they offered me a ride.

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:46.285
I didn't really trust 'em.
I didn't really trust any Germans,

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:49.914
but they were straight up,
you know, took me to Frankfurt

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:53.248
and became two of my
closest friends to this day.

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.376
Britt and Saul.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:56.503
You met 'em when you were six.

01:19:56.583 --> 01:19:58.551
You probably don't remember.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.636
Anyway, I wandered around
the streets of Frankfurt

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:06.764
for four full hours.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:11.644
I mean, I'm dipping into restaurants
and bars, hostels looking for her.

01:20:11.724 --> 01:20:13.812
I finally saw her.

01:20:13.892 --> 01:20:16.645
She was standing on the corner,

01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:21.326
hailing a cab, 3:00 in the morning.

01:20:21.942 --> 01:20:25.071
She stuck out almost as much as I did,

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:29.578
but she was also the flyest girl
in that entire country,

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:32.748
I mean, knock you on your knees fine.
You know what I'm saying?

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:38.334
Her mouth dropped when she saw me.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.965
Her jaw... daah... to the ground, man.

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:43.759
I walked up to her.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.261
I'll never forget this.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:50.182
First thing she said when she saw me,
you know what she said?

01:20:50.262 --> 01:20:54.812
She said,
"Please tell me you not here for me."

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.855
And then she jumped on me.

01:20:56.935 --> 01:20:59.358
She... She grabbed me. She hugged me.

01:20:59.438 --> 01:21:01.485
It was like a scene
from a movie, you know?

01:21:01.565 --> 01:21:04.819
That's the end
of a chick flick right there.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:07.030
We stayed the whole weekend in Frankfurt,

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:10.116
and I never took my flight
back to New York.

01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:17.126
Love will make you
do some stupid shit, Mo,

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.834
and I'm not trying to keep you
from experiencing that shit.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.131
I'm not trying to keep you
from experiencing anything.

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:25.551
My job is to raise you right,
and it's hard, man,

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:28.846
especially if you not gonna be
on my team, you know?

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:32.305
I know I put you in the fire
by bringing us here,

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:35.642
and you might be
still mad at me about that,

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.978
but I make the best decisions
I can for you.

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.607
Period.

01:21:40.687 --> 01:21:44.191
I was in Berlin interviewing
for a job with their team

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:45.696
to get us out of here.

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:49.325
I didn't want to tell you,
because who knows if I'll get it or not.

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:53.620
But I'm trying, you know,
'cause it's hard out here for me, too.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.203
You gotta remember we in the same boat.

01:21:56.286 --> 01:21:58.254
So get on my team, man.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:05.463
Tell me what's going on,
and I'll be there for you.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.721
We the only two brothers in Heidelberg.

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.520
We gotta stick together.
Know what I'm saying?

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:18.187
How'd you know it was a girl?

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.608
It's always a girl, Mo.

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.902
I do hate it here.

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.327
My man.

01:22:33.407 --> 01:22:35.329
I know.

01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:36.786
But check it.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:39.583
I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:43.212
but one day, when you lighting
the hip-hop world on fire,

01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:46.090
it'll be 'cause you have
a unique perspective.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:51.136
And when you collecting
all your Source Awards, you'll thank me.

01:22:51.216 --> 01:22:52.468
- Source Awards?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.265
Is that as far as I get in your dreams?

01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:57.643
- All right. All right. You right.
- Can I get a Grammy or something?

01:22:57.723 --> 01:22:59.475
Nobel Prize! How 'bout that?

01:22:59.558 --> 01:23:01.435
Thank me in that speech.

01:23:03.604 --> 01:23:05.317
So I'm not in trouble?

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:06.523
Hah!

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:10.111
Oh, no, you grounded like a motherfucker.

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:25.796
Mmm!

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:29.130
- That is delicious!
- Right.

01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:31.966
- Marvelous!
- Someone's in a good mood today.

01:23:32.049 --> 01:23:34.721
Yep. Not grounded anymore.

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:38.142
Oh. You a free man? What are you gonna do?

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.185
Whatever I want.

01:23:40.265 --> 01:23:42.643
So you're not angry at me anymore?

01:23:44.228 --> 01:23:45.774
Nah.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:47.192
Sweet.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:48.569
Don't trust you, though.

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:50.151
No?

01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:55.033
- Don't trust no German women.
- I ain't German.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.160
What?

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:57.453
I'm not German.

01:23:57.533 --> 01:23:59.706
Do you even speak German?

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:05.878
Well, I guess then it's
a good time to tell you

01:24:05.958 --> 01:24:08.130
I'm not gonna be your tutor anymore.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:11.008
- Why?
- Because I'm graduating.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:14.386
So we... we can't pay you or anything?

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:17.055
I don't know German well enough to stop.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.932
Well, you can pay someone else,

01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:24.644
but not me, 'cause I'm moving to New York.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.568
- For your boyfriend?
- And for me.

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:36.325
- Damn.
- Language, mister.

01:24:36.405 --> 01:24:37.657
"Damn" isn't language.

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.741
You gonna miss me?

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:41.998
- No, not a bit.
- Little bit?

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.586
All right.

01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:14.279
Dear Mr. Gangster,
I am writing you from Düsseldorf.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.782
Per played a show here last night,

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:20.536
and we have a few more days
before we go to Hannover.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:23.080
I'm very sorry we left you in Frankfurt,

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.707
but I think this was the best thing to do.

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:27.709
So maybe I'm not sorry.

01:25:27.789 --> 01:25:30.292
But I'm sorry I did not say good-bye,

01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:34.005
because I'm not sure if I'll be
coming back to Heidelberg.

01:25:34.087 --> 01:25:37.511
You made me see how everyone
there is just dickheads.

01:25:37.591 --> 01:25:40.219
Per is talking about moving to Berlin

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:43.431
and wants me to move in with him.
Isn't that great?

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:46.266
Anyway, I wish you could write me back,

01:25:46.350 --> 01:25:51.732
but I don't have an address,
so just think of me sometimes, OK?

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:55.818
Oh, P.S. I listened to some Jay-Z.

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.240
Pimps and ladies brushing shoulders.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.033
Cool song.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:02.786
And your impression was really good.

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:06.540
I'm happy I've met you,
Morris from America.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.042
Enjoy the picture.

01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:11.250
Love, Katrin.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.895
That bunny-ear-giving motherfucker.
