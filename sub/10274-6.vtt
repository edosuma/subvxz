00:01.330 --> 00:02.672
-Paige, what is this?

00:02.680 --> 00:03.988
-I'm allowed to
have my own life.

00:03.990 --> 00:05.571
-And are allowed
to know about it.

00:05.580 --> 00:07.889
-I'm going to let you
in on a little secret

00:07.900 --> 00:09.561
about your very big brother.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.264
He's an animal.

00:11.010 --> 00:11.533
-Rea|ly?

00:11.540 --> 00:12.234
-Rea|ly.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.776
-What's your
relationship with him?

00:13.780 --> 00:14.929
He works for a congressman.

00:14.930 --> 00:18.900
He-- the Intelligence Committee
overseeing Central America.

00:18.910 --> 00:20.719
-Who does he think you are?

00:20.720 --> 00:22.665
-A graduate student
in political science.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.012
-Do you know what you took?

00:24.020 --> 00:27.524
-We smoked, uh, cocaine,
and I took pills.

00:27.530 --> 00:29.304
-I'm Kate, Claudia's
replacement.

00:29.310 --> 00:30.618
-What is this, your
first assignment?

00:30.620 --> 00:31.985
-Claudi_a was the most
experienced handler

00:31.990 --> 00:33.912
in Directorate S and you
found her unacceptable.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.649
The centre wants you happy.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.264
I want you happy.

00:47.810 --> 00:52.429
-What can you give me in
exchange for Nina's safety?

00:52.440 --> 00:53.225
-Emmett?

00:53.230 --> 00:55.676
-You have to help me
find Emmett and Leanne's

00:55.680 --> 00:57.329
killer, Andrew Larrick.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.319
Emmett and Leanne
were blackmailing him.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.662
He's homosexual.

01:00.670 --> 01:03.332
-To get to Larrick, you'll
need an airtight cover.

01:03.340 --> 01:06.525
-He's currently involved in
developing a special mission

01:06.530 --> 01:08.282
unit inside the Navy Seals.

01:08.290 --> 01:10.429
-I really do think you're
trying to help, Claudia,

01:10.430 --> 01:11.954
but it just takes
three minutes in a car

01:11.960 --> 01:14.372
to know there's something
else going on with you, too.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.109
And I want to know what it is.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.090
-I don't want to
lose anyone else.

01:28.590 --> 01:32.048
-We're meeting at an
office park in Reston.

01:32.050 --> 01:32.800
-Eric's meeting you?

01:32.810 --> 01:34.459
You're not picking him up?

01:34.460 --> 01:36.940
-We reached out to
him as CIA security,

01:36.950 --> 01:40.215
asked him to meet
at an off site.

01:40.220 --> 01:42.541
-What?

01:42.550 --> 01:43.835
-If he killed Emmett
and Leanne, he'll

01:43.840 --> 01:45.614
be looking for us
to come back at him.

01:45.620 --> 01:48.225
_ -We'll have him
Isolated In a room.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.346
Two of us, one of him.

01:50.350 --> 01:53.535
-If you discover he did it,
you'll take care of him there?

01:53.540 --> 01:55.849
-Yeah.

01:55.860 --> 01:58.169
-Which one of you?

01:58.180 --> 02:00.319
-You're asking for
a lot of details.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.379
-We haven't dealt with
someone qunte like hIm before.

02:02.390 --> 02:09.444
-Well, he'll be more on guard
with me, so-- You OK, Claudia?

02:12.240 --> 02:12.979
-Of course.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.974
How's your new handler?

02:17.980 --> 02:20.175
She graduate high school yet?

02:20.180 --> 02:20.999
-She's new.

02:21.010 --> 02:23.467
We'll see.

02:23.470 --> 02:26.280
_ -I'll run counter
surveillance and wait for you.

02:26.290 --> 02:26.984
-Good.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.529
-Where's Nina?

02:54.530 --> 02:56.805
-She missed a couple of
your meetings, I know.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.789
I've been keeping her
busy at the rezidentura.

03:04.180 --> 03:05.920
I see you have feelings for her.

03:05.930 --> 03:08.239
-What is it you want?

03:08.250 --> 03:12.562
-The FBI surveillance
logs that pertain to me.

03:12.570 --> 03:17.507
Who follows me, where, and when.

03:17.510 --> 03:18.829
I'm asking a lot.

03:18.830 --> 03:19.865
It's true.

03:19.870 --> 03:24.239
But there's a new reality
for us to adjust to.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.638
-You're on your own here.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.108
-I speak only for myself.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.089
I have my own needs,
my own problems.

03:31.090 --> 03:32.034
Believe me.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.644
It can work.

03:33.650 --> 03:35.948
For both of us.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.178
You're a patriot.

03:37.180 --> 03:37.874
I respect that.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.442
You love your job, your
family, your country.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.156
Me, too.

03:44.160 --> 03:47.948
This is not a problem
for what I need.

03:47.950 --> 03:51.647
-It's a problem for me.

03:51.650 --> 03:52.992
-My surveillance logs.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.422
You have three days.

04:01.860 --> 04:06.274
If anything happens to me, of
course, what I know about Nina,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.602
everyone will know.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.851
I die, she dies.

04:58.430 --> 05:00.990
-Captain Larrick, have a seat.

05:00.990 --> 05:04.118
-I've never been to this
facility of yours before.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.257
-Neither have we.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.194
We rented it for this meeting.

05:07.200 --> 05:07.894
-Can I see your IDs?

05:14.060 --> 05:15.220
Quite a career, Captain.

05:17.870 --> 05:19.974
You people have
everything, don't you?

05:19.980 --> 05:20.878
-Almost.

05:20.890 --> 05:22.221
Not quite.

05:22.230 --> 05:25.939
-I was particularly impressed
by your January 1981 feasibility

05:25.950 --> 05:28.817
study and our agencies
plan to assasinate--

05:28.820 --> 05:30.276
-Why am I here?

05:30.280 --> 05:31.474
-Captain Larrick,
you've been called

05:31.480 --> 05:33.243
in for a meeting
with CIA Security.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.923
We have your full military
personnel file on the table.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.716
You know why you're here.

05:37.720 --> 05:39.768
Vietnam, up and
down Latin America.

05:39.770 --> 05:42.614
You're an American
hero, up until 1978.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.814
Buenos Aires.

05:43.820 --> 05:46.163
This is where the
KGB pitched you.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.536
-You've worked with them for
the last three and a half years.

05:48.540 --> 05:50.326
-The first report you gave
had communication codes

05:50.330 --> 05:52.059
from multiple on-ship systems.

05:52.060 --> 05:54.073
-You followed up with
reconnaissance reports

05:54.080 --> 05:57.356
from your operations in Central
America, security protocols

05:57.360 --> 06:01.876
at naval bases, including Little
Creek, Groton, Patuxent River.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.519
-You betrayed your country,
service, fellow Seals.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.589
For what?

06:05.590 --> 06:06.807
-We have everything.

06:06.810 --> 06:09.699
Meeting times, drop
sites, full communication

06:09.700 --> 06:10.632
plan with your handlers.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.733
-How much did they pay
you turn on your own?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.935
-So you've got someone inside
the KBG who gave me up.

06:14.940 --> 06:15.634
-You know what?

06:15.640 --> 06:16.766
You charge me, you burn them.

06:16.770 --> 06:17.759
You're never going to do that.

06:17.770 --> 06:19.203
I'll walk away from this.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.509
-Sit down, captain.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.683
-Why don't we work backwards?

06:25.690 --> 06:27.817
Why don't you tell us everything
that happened on the day

06:27.820 --> 06:29.356
that you killed
your KGB handlers?

06:38.390 --> 06:39.823
-How would you feel
ifI did kill them?

06:42.700 --> 06:44.179
-We'd understand.

06:44.180 --> 06:45.295
They were KGB officers.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.590
However, after three
and a half years,

06:51.600 --> 06:54.899
I'd be curious to
know what happened.

06:54.900 --> 06:55.969
-Why do you think I killed them?

06:55.970 --> 06:57.028
Were you on them?

06:57.030 --> 06:59.533
-What do you think?

06:59.540 --> 07:02.338
-I think you're fishing.

07:02.350 --> 07:05.285
I didn't kill them.

07:05.290 --> 07:07.235
I wanted to.

07:07.240 --> 07:07.945
I got close.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.121
-How close?

07:12.330 --> 07:14.139
-The town they lived
in, cars they drove,

07:14.150 --> 07:15.777
the fact that they were married.

07:15.780 --> 07:21.810
I was two or three meetings
from finding their home address.

07:21.820 --> 07:26.120
Someone to the
bastard before I did.

07:26.130 --> 07:27.358
Didn't happen to nicer people.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.841
-So when was your last
contact with them?

07:32.850 --> 07:35.375
-Over a month ago.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.519
I was on Martial Eagle
when they got killed.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.260
Ask your people about it.

07:39.270 --> 07:42.569
The Soviets are going to take
it left, right, and sideways

07:42.570 --> 07:44.128
for the next 20 years
now that we have

07:44.130 --> 07:48.157
a president who can handle them.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.142
Whatever damage I've done, I'm
making up for it in Nicaragua.

07:52.150 --> 07:55.039
-If you don't want to spend
the rest your life in prison,

07:55.040 --> 07:55.904
we have an option for you.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.856
-And that's why
you, not the FBI--

07:58.860 --> 08:00.999
-The KGB will come back for you.

08:01.010 --> 08:02.887
-Maintain your arrangement.

08:02.890 --> 08:04.653
-Report to you.

08:04.660 --> 08:05.354
-Yes.

08:17.220 --> 08:20.178
We
don't think he did it.

08:20.180 --> 08:21.670
You we'ren't followed.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.138
Scan for dust just to be
safe, clothes and shoes.

08:25.150 --> 08:27.471
You don't think?

08:27.480 --> 08:29.528
-He said he got close to
making Emmett and Leanne.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.339
-Wanted to kill them,
planned to kill them.

08:31.350 --> 08:33.443
-That wasn't enough for you?

08:33.450 --> 08:36.089
-Larrick knows
something very big.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.273
Martial Eagle, it was
mentioned in his file, too.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.645
We've got to find
out what that it.

08:39.650 --> 08:40.651
Then we'll take care of

08:40.660 --> 08:43.447
-Emmett and Leanne thought
he might come after them.

08:43.450 --> 08:44.405
You don't think he did it?

08:44.410 --> 08:46.651
He could be five
steps ahead of you.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.082
-We made a call in
the field, Claudia.

08:48.090 --> 08:52.220
-I told you how
dangerous this man is.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.970
He bought your cover.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.335
-He seemed to, but you're right,
we can't be sure about him.

08:56.340 --> 08:57.432
-Your identities
are backstopped.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.819
He won't ask any questions,
risk discovery of his treason.

09:00.820 --> 09:01.616
-You're clean.

09:01.620 --> 09:05.738
-But that doesn't mean he won't
come after you and your family

09:05.750 --> 09:06.535
when he finds out.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.087
-We'll talk to the centre.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.536
-I'd appreciate it if you kept
me out of that conversation.

09:10.540 --> 09:12.599
_-We know where he
lives, where he works.

09:12.610 --> 09:14.339
They're going to want
information on Martial Eagle.

09:14.340 --> 09:16.046
Then we'll take him out.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.220
Never seen Claudia
scared before.

10:16.570 --> 10:19.892
How can you read?

10:19.900 --> 10:22.755
-Just staring at the pages.

10:22.760 --> 10:23.966
-Did you make the signal?

10:23.970 --> 10:24.664
-Yeah.

10:24.670 --> 10:25.364
We meet tomorrow.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.855
-How old was he?

11:24.860 --> 11:25.554
-33.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.152
-He was so funny.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.821
What was the, uh,
name of that movie

11:28.830 --> 11:30.491
that he did with--
about the fraternity?

11:30.500 --> 11:31.899
-"Animal House."

11:31.910 --> 11:33.502
-Yeah.

11:33.510 --> 11:34.204
-Christ.

11:34.210 --> 11:37.919
Seven years of college
down the drain.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.147
-What?

11:39.150 --> 11:42.779
-That's what Belushi's character
says when he gets expelled.

11:42.780 --> 11:45.419
-That's funny.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.146
-Life's like that.

11:46.150 --> 11:47.879
In half a second, it's over.

11:56.970 --> 11:59.655
You haven't said anything.

11:59.660 --> 12:01.025
-About what?

12:01.030 --> 12:02.748
-The front door.

12:02.750 --> 12:03.705
-I like it.

12:03.710 --> 12:04.734
-You do?

12:04.740 --> 12:05.434
-Yeah.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.816
It's different.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.458
-It is different.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.234
-I thought a lot
about the color.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.879
You know, it's-- it's a
happy red, don't you think?

12:12.880 --> 12:15.929
It's called, uh, Tomato Tango.

12:15.940 --> 12:18.738
-Yo, in China, red
means good luck.

12:18.740 --> 12:19.513
-Huh.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.817
-Well, you can't have
too much of that.

12:27.190 --> 12:28.748
-What do you think they're
doing in Nicaragua?

12:32.190 --> 12:35.512
-Trying to destroy it.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.035
Any time something decent
or humane starts there,

12:39.040 --> 12:39.950
they can't stand it.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.851
-I'|| rest better
when that guy's dead.

12:43.860 --> 12:47.739
-Then we'll just lie here
wondering who killed Emmett

12:47.750 --> 12:52.016
and Leanne_and when
they're coming for us.

12:52.020 --> 12:55.979
You said we'd get used to it.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.446
-I was wrong.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.196
-Want to hear something funny?

13:06.200 --> 13:08.521
-Mm hm.

13:08.530 --> 13:11.442
-When Jennifer went
to talk to your wife--

13:11.450 --> 13:13.850
-She's not my wife.

13:13.860 --> 13:21.448
-Martha told me that Clark
was a wild animal in bed.

13:21.450 --> 13:22.485
-She said that?

13:22.490 --> 13:24.469
-Mm hm.

13:24.480 --> 13:25.959
Isn't that funny?

13:30.240 --> 13:30.934
-Yeah.

13:38.780 --> 13:41.248
Just as the
Columbia we think represents

13:41.260 --> 13:44.388
man's finest aspirations
in the field of science

13:44.390 --> 13:47.075
and technology, so,
too, does the struggle

13:47.080 --> 13:49.219
of the Afghan people
represent man's

13:49.220 --> 13:52.064
highest aspirations for freedom.

13:52.070 --> 13:54.243
The fact that freedom
is the strongest--

13:54.250 --> 13:56.992
-Hi.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.321
What's this?

13:59.330 --> 14:01.002
-Emmett and Leanne had
ad agent, Andrew Larrick.

14:01.010 --> 14:02.557
Those are his personal records.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.436
-What are we having?

14:03.440 --> 14:04.998
-Uh, another seltzer.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.387
-Vodka, straight up, please.

14:07.390 --> 14:10.393
-It's a little early in
the day, don't you think?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.436
-It's a bar.

14:12.440 --> 14:14.112
-There's an operation
called Martial

14:14.120 --> 14:15.758
Eagle mentioned in there.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.022
He said it's something
in Nicaragua.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.248
-Where did you get these?

14:19.260 --> 14:20.909
-When we were finding
our way to Larrick.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.649
-Why's you'd ﬁnd
your way to him?

14:22.650 --> 14:26.859
-To determine if he
killed Emmett and Leanne.

14:26.870 --> 14:27.837
-Thank you.

14:27.840 --> 14:28.534
-Thanks.

14:31.380 --> 14:33.302
-You're looking into
that on your own?

14:33.310 --> 14:34.004
-Yeah.

14:34.010 --> 14:36.149
In the real world,
sometimes you get a lead,

14:36.160 --> 14:36.888
you have to move fast.

14:36.890 --> 14:38.187
So if the centre has
a problem with it,

14:38.190 --> 14:40.238
they can take it up with us.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.014
-Did he kill Emmett and Leanne?

14:42.020 --> 14:44.443
-We don't think so,
but we can't be sure.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.125
Larrick presents a threat
to us and our family.

14:48.130 --> 14:50.849
-Martial Eagle could present
a threat to the motherland.

14:50.860 --> 14:52.555
Once we know how and why,
we want to eliminate him.

14:57.570 --> 15:00.255
-I will relay your point
of view to the centre.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.740
They won't want you and your
family unnecessarily exposed.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.843
I'll make sure of it.

15:04.850 --> 15:05.544
-Good.

15:05.550 --> 15:07.859
--in Afghanistan,
but for freedom, wherever

15:07.870 --> 15:09.349
it is threatened or suppressed.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.143
-Hey, what's this?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.038
-Oh, uh, transitioning our data.

15:19.050 --> 15:21.883
We're inputting files
into the OCR machine.

15:21.890 --> 15:22.584
-OCR?

15:22.590 --> 15:23.284
-Oh, yeah.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.099
It's, uh, optical
character recognition.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.579
Pretty soon, all
of our records will

15:26.580 --> 15:29.834
have a duplicate
presence on the computer.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.195
-And that's a good thing?

15:32.200 --> 15:34.418
-Less redundancy.

15:34.420 --> 15:35.671
-But where did everything go?

15:35.680 --> 15:36.374
-Oh.

15:36.380 --> 15:38.075
Um, we're archiving
that section.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.696
Um, but what did you need?

15:40.700 --> 15:42.099
-Soviet Embassy logs.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.226
They're in a box.

15:43.230 --> 15:44.697
I can make a quick copy.

15:44.700 --> 15:45.507
-Oh, no, no.

15:45.510 --> 15:46.465
No, this is great.

15:46.470 --> 15:47.630
Here, uh, let me
show you how it's

15:47.640 --> 15:49.710
going to work from here on in.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.927
Um, what are the dates you need?

15:51.930 --> 15:52.703
-Uh, last three months.

15:55.930 --> 15:58.615
-And, uh, anyone in particular?

15:58.620 --> 16:03.319
-Oleg Igoravich Burov.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.024
-Burov.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.213
That's one "R" or two?

16:05.220 --> 16:05.914
-One.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.848
-All right.

16:10.850 --> 16:11.839
Here it comes.

16:17.260 --> 16:20.218
-I can take it from here.

16:36.490 --> 16:39.584
-You know, Martha doesn't seem--

16:39.590 --> 16:40.284
-What?

16:43.110 --> 16:45.431
-Like someone who'd go
for the aggressive type.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.640
-You never know what
people are Into.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.174
-That's true.

17:09.670 --> 17:11.467
What kind?

17:11.470 --> 17:12.778
-What?

17:12.780 --> 17:13.576
-Of wild animal.

17:20.060 --> 17:22.028
-You're kidding, right?

17:22.030 --> 17:22.724
-Maybe.

17:22.730 --> 17:24.129
I don't know.

17:31.330 --> 17:35.141
Would Clark ever be unfaithful?

17:38.580 --> 17:42.835
Ithink I would like
to try it with Clark.

17:48.720 --> 17:50.927
-I don't know what you
imagine he's like, Elizabeth.

17:50.930 --> 17:52.067
-I'm just curious.

17:52.070 --> 17:52.809
That's all I'm saying.

17:52.810 --> 18:00.069
I mean, you know, because--
What, are you scared?

18:02.730 --> 18:04.584
-Scared, no.

18:04.590 --> 18:06.899
-Good.

18:09.230 --> 18:11.937
-You going to get that?

18:18.900 --> 18:20.720
-Hello?

18:20.730 --> 18:21.424
Yes.

18:24.580 --> 18:26.252
She-- well, it's not
the end of the season.

18:29.740 --> 18:30.434
yes.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.249
Thank you.

18:32.260 --> 18:32.954
Paige!

18:32.960 --> 18:33.836
-What happened?

18:33.840 --> 18:35.546
-She quit the volleyball team.

18:35.550 --> 18:36.972
Coming.

18:36.980 --> 18:39.540
-Why did you quit
the volleyball team?

18:39.540 --> 18:40.552
-You love volleyball.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.437
-I just lost interest.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.134
-No.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.903
What happened?

18:44.910 --> 18:45.604
-Nothing.

18:45.610 --> 18:47.043
I'm not allowed to change?

18:49.850 --> 18:50.544
-No.

18:50.550 --> 18:52.086
Will you talk to her?

18:52.090 --> 18:53.114
I'll get this.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.439
_ I was
gomg to tell you.

18:54.450 --> 18:55.792
-Hello?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.199
-Ms. Jennings.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.349
-This is Mrs. Jennings.

18:58.350 --> 18:59.544
-If you don't want
to play, you wait

18:59.550 --> 19:01.086
until the end of the season.
-What's the big deal?

19:01.090 --> 19:03.240
I was only on the
B squad, anyway.

19:03.250 --> 19:04.467
-We already have a
delivery service.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.437
Thank you very much.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.668
-Are you sure?

19:06.670 --> 19:09.798
Dependability is
our middle name.

19:09.810 --> 19:10.765
-We'll keep it in mind.

19:10.770 --> 19:11.464
Thank you very much.

19:11.470 --> 19:12.937
Can I
go do my homework now?

19:12.940 --> 19:13.634
-Yes.

19:18.310 --> 19:20.062
What's going on with her?

19:20.070 --> 19:21.708
-Whatever it is, it's
going to have to wait.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.716
-Centre is determined that
Martial Eagle is an operation

19:43.720 --> 19:48.828
to train Nicaraguan contras
at a secret base on US soil.

19:48.830 --> 19:50.570
-So, Larrick?

19:50.580 --> 19:52.798
-They reviewed
your request, and--

19:52.810 --> 19:53.697
-A request?

19:53.700 --> 19:56.271
-We brought them a fantastic
piece of intelligence

19:56.280 --> 19:58.748
which they're thrilled with.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.479
So now it's time to keep
us and our family safe.

20:01.480 --> 20:02.856
-And they understand that.

20:02.860 --> 20:04.623
You know, nothing is
more important to them

20:04.630 --> 20:06.143
than your safety.

20:06.150 --> 20:09.460
-Sounds like something is.

20:09.470 --> 20:11.438
-I think you understand
how much this operation

20:11.440 --> 20:13.544
means to the Americans, Which?

20:13.550 --> 20:15.711
Is why you didn' kill Larrick
when you had the chance.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.683
We conferred with our fraternal
organisation in Nicaragua.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.999
They now believe that Contra
field commanders travelling

20:28.000 --> 20:29.547
to the United
States for briefings

20:29.550 --> 20:31.097
must be training here.

20:31.100 --> 20:31.998
-And?

20:32.000 --> 20:34.059
-You're being tasked with
assassinating the field

20:34.060 --> 20:37.473
commanders and
exposmg the camps.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.890
The American people
deserve to know

20:38.900 --> 20:41.653
what their government's
doing behind their backs.

20:41.660 --> 20:42.365
You'll need Larrick.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.907
-There are other ways.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.265
-He's our way into the camp.

20:47.270 --> 20:50.205
The centre understands the
danger he presents but knows

20:50.210 --> 20:52.349
you're well equipped
to handle these risks.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.157
-Where's the camp?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.742
And when will the field
commanders be on site?

21:01.750 --> 21:04.492
-That's yet to be determined.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.503
-And how exactly does the centre
expect us to determine that?

21:28.510 --> 21:29.886
Don't do that.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.393
-I'm grateful to you.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.699
I needed help, and
you were there for me.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.260
-It's about to
get harder, Lucia.

21:38.270 --> 21:40.727
-I came here for the revolution.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.357
I'm not afraid.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.783
-What did your people tell you?

21:44.790 --> 21:46.360
-Only that I should
do what you say.

21:48.910 --> 21:53.506
-Did you follow my advice
about your congressional aide?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.501
Did you make him your boyfriend?

21:55.510 --> 21:57.182
-I toy with him.

21:57.190 --> 21:58.464
Keep him chasing me.

21:58.470 --> 21:59.698
Men like that.

21:59.700 --> 22:01.930
-Have you slept with him?

22:01.940 --> 22:05.478
-You shouldn't give
that away so easily.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.608
-I need to get into his
congressman's private office.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.837
The Capitol's a public building.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.512
That part's not a problem.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.967
You need to get me
the rest of the way.

22:14.970 --> 22:16.847
-Of course.

22:16.850 --> 22:20.525
-We're fighting for the
same thing, the two of us.

22:20.530 --> 22:24.125
We need to make
this happen fast.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.223
-I understand.

22:26.230 --> 22:26.924
-Good.

22:35.550 --> 22:40.590
--Take it easy, or you
won't be able to make my night.

22:43.860 --> 22:44.554
-Don't worry.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.606
I'm a man of my word.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.189
-Hey, what's going on out there?

23:03.580 --> 23:06.014
-I thought I heard something.

23:13.810 --> 23:17.473
-What are you doing?

23:17.480 --> 23:21.109
-I want to see
the seat of power.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.382
-That turn you on?

23:22.390 --> 23:24.085
-Hmm.

23:24.090 --> 23:27.400
I want to rub my tetas all
over the Congressman's desk.

23:32.880 --> 23:34.484
Are you going to
open this door, Carl,

23:34.490 --> 23:36.674
or don't you have the key?

23:36.680 --> 23:37.681
-Of course I have the key.

23:37.690 --> 23:38.384
-Oh.

23:38.390 --> 23:39.869
Maybe you don't have
the cojones, then.

23:39.880 --> 23:40.574
-No.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.462
Maybe you should check.

23:55.290 --> 23:58.646
I thought you wanted to, uh--

23:58.650 --> 23:59.639
-I do.

24:39.250 --> 24:40.057
-Don't stop.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.857
-Do you like that?

24:41.860 --> 24:42.554
-Yes.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.050
Yes, keep going.

24:44.060 --> 24:47.040
Keep going.

24:47.050 --> 24:49.029
-You like that, baby?

24:49.030 --> 24:51.009
-That's good.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.979
-Are you almost there?

25:18.880 --> 25:21.622
Good night, Mr. President.

25:30.960 --> 25:31.654
-Amazing.

26:37.370 --> 26:40.066
-Two field commanders will
be at the Contra training

26:40.070 --> 26:41.287
camp in a week.

26:41.290 --> 26:42.609
-Does it say where?

26:42.610 --> 26:43.304
-Uh, yeah.

26:43.310 --> 26:46.894
Uh, campground, Jefferson
National Forest.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.709
Larrick's part of the
senior training team,

26:48.720 --> 26:50.722
but even he won't be told
the location till the day

26:50.730 --> 26:52.129
he gets his orders to go.

26:55.620 --> 26:59.898
So we get the empty
protocol at him as CIA.

26:59.900 --> 27:00.594
We kill him.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.797
We go in ourselves with Lucia.

27:03.800 --> 27:07.292
-We've already said no
to that, more or less.

27:07.300 --> 27:11.066
The odds of us getting in are
much better if he takes us in.

27:11.070 --> 27:11.764
-Whoa.

27:11.770 --> 27:12.600
For that--

27:12.610 --> 27:14.419
-We'd have to let him
know who we really are.

27:18.160 --> 27:19.912
-I'm sure he's going
to take that news well.

27:53.660 --> 27:56.140
-I'm looking for Mr. Gaad?

27:56.150 --> 27:58.015
-You work with him?

27:58.020 --> 28:00.432
-Yes, ma'am.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.793
-Come in.

28:01.800 --> 28:02.789
-Thank you.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.586
-You can wait in there.

28:09.590 --> 28:10.579
-Thank you.

28:28.990 --> 28:30.730
-In search of perfect
understanding,

28:30.740 --> 28:32.719
Agent Beeman, or are you hungry?

28:32.730 --> 28:34.709
-Sorry for bothering
you at home, sir.

28:34.710 --> 28:36.484
-Nevertheless, here you are.

28:51.000 --> 28:54.401
My source at the rezidentura
has been compromised.

28:54.410 --> 28:57.004
-You think it's time to
shut down the operation?

28:57.010 --> 28:59.194
-She's been working for
us over a year, sir.

28:59.200 --> 29:03.148
If we ex-filtrate her now,
her family in Moscow will die.

29:03.150 --> 29:04.629
-What do you want from me?

29:04.630 --> 29:05.403
She needs help.

29:10.080 --> 29:15.450
-There are things they might
want, things we can give them.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.382
-I'm about to be
called to testify

29:17.390 --> 29:20.939
before a closed or congressional
committee, thanks to the shit

29:20.940 --> 29:22.521
you pulled.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.192
Don't tell me anything
more that I can't hear.

29:30.390 --> 29:34.952
-She's in way over
her head, sir.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.758
-Well, before you do
anything you can't undo,

29:37.760 --> 29:39.842
has it occurred_ to
you that you might

29:39.850 --> 29:41.147
be the one in over your head?

29:44.180 --> 29:48.469
I'd offer you a drink, but my
wife and I were on our way out.

29:48.470 --> 29:51.951
-Thank you, sir.

29:51.960 --> 29:52.949
Thank you.

30:51.970 --> 30:54.279
-This is important.

30:54.290 --> 30:56.508
This is what I train for.

30:56.510 --> 30:58.819
We're going to unmask
the oppressors,

30:58.830 --> 31:01.492
shine a light on years
of US criminal policy,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.161
propping up dictators,
bringing down

31:03.170 --> 31:04.637
democratically elected leaders.

31:04.640 --> 31:05.629
-One step at a time, Lucia.

31:05.640 --> 31:07.619
-Expose the murderers.

31:07.630 --> 31:09.655
Bring this president
to his knees.

31:09.660 --> 31:13.778
And then maybe this war can end.

31:13.780 --> 31:18.205
-A world without exploitation
and dignity for all.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.484
-You think it's a dream?

31:22.150 --> 31:25.199
-I've been ready to die my
whole life for it, Lucia.

31:29.690 --> 31:31.430
What you did in the
congressman's office--

31:31.440 --> 31:32.725
-I did what I had to do.

31:32.730 --> 31:34.539
-Yes.

31:34.540 --> 31:36.849
-I'll be able to get
so much more from him.

31:36.860 --> 31:37.554
You'll see.

31:40.290 --> 31:41.222
-That's not going to happen.

31:45.820 --> 31:49.847
You need to tie up loose ends.

31:49.850 --> 31:53.843
-Carl has the ear of a_ _
powerful government offICIal.

31:53.850 --> 31:57.377
-After the operation,
it's only a matter of time

31:57.380 --> 31:59.177
before they track
the intelligence back

31:59.180 --> 31:59.930
to the congressman.

31:59.940 --> 32:03.876
To his safe, to
his aide, to you.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.131
-That is a risk I'm
willing to take.

32:05.140 --> 32:06.744
-Why is that?

32:06.750 --> 32:09.878
Why would you risk
something for him?

32:09.880 --> 32:13.395
Oh, because you like him.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.856
That's OK.

32:14.860 --> 32:16.179
It happens.

32:16.180 --> 32:17.613
-I don't need so many lessons.

32:21.220 --> 32:22.414
I can decide for myself--

32:22.420 --> 32:29.383
-l_=irst_time I had to_resolve a
Situation such a painful way,

32:29.390 --> 32:31.415
I tried not to think about it.

32:31.420 --> 32:32.239
The moment came.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.911
It was fast.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.879
I went home, wrote my
report, and I went to bed.

32:37.890 --> 32:41.189
I would advise you
to do the same.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.543
-I have watched so many
people die in front of me

32:43.550 --> 32:45.541
during the war.

32:45.550 --> 32:46.460
I'm not a child.

32:46.470 --> 32:47.801
-Watching is different.

32:47.810 --> 32:49.721
-I can do my job.

32:49.730 --> 32:51.459
-I know you can.

33:10.190 --> 33:11.179
Come here.

33:38.490 --> 33:39.184
No.

33:39.190 --> 33:41.829
I want you to keep them on.

34:22.750 --> 34:24.047
No.

34:24.750 --> 34:27.833
want Clark.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.932
-This is Clark.

34:28.940 --> 34:35.129
-You look like him, but
you're not being him.

34:35.130 --> 34:37.701
Do you do that with her?

34:37.710 --> 34:40.452
Is that how you do it?

34:40.460 --> 34:41.711
-Yeah.

34:41.720 --> 34:43.654
-It's the same.

34:43.660 --> 34:44.740
-Well, I'm-- I'm sorry.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.648
I don't know what you mean.

34:48.300 --> 34:49.358
-Can you just--
-What?

34:49.360 --> 34:50.338
Just-- what?

34:50.340 --> 34:52.991
What do you want, exactly?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.353
-She said he was an animal.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.759
I want you to just be Clark.

35:08.190 --> 35:08.872
Ah!

35:29.630 --> 35:34.146
-Is that what you want?

35:34.150 --> 35:37.313
Is that what you want?

35:37.320 --> 35:38.708
-It's OK.

35:38.710 --> 35:39.551
I'm OK.

35:39.560 --> 35:40.254
It's just--

35:45.480 --> 35:47.459
-Give me a minute.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.540
-My mom's coming
into town next week.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.359
I want you to meet her.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.196
-Why?

37:07.200 --> 37:09.236
-Because you are special to me.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.415
-What-- uh, what is her name?

37:16.420 --> 37:17.114
-Doris.

37:45.490 --> 37:46.730
-I'm thirsty.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.208
Do you mind getting me
a glass of cold water?

37:53.150 --> 37:55.345
Ice water, por favour.

38:24.730 --> 38:25.424
Gracias.

38:43.360 --> 38:44.258
You first.

38:47.630 --> 38:48.585
I like to watch.

39:28.910 --> 39:33.301
Have you ever had anything
you would die for, amor?

39:33.310 --> 39:34.652
-That's a funny question.

39:34.660 --> 39:37.254
-What matters to you?

39:37.260 --> 39:39.649
Politics?

39:39.660 --> 39:40.934
-Politics is a game.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.489
My mama, maybe.

39:54.010 --> 39:54.704
-Doris.

39:57.910 --> 40:02.062
Think of Doris, mi amor.

40:02.070 --> 40:05.085
Think about how
much you love her.

40:05.090 --> 40:08.776
-I'd rather think about you.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.190
-Dance with me.

40:27.660 --> 40:28.445
-Something's happening.

40:31.810 --> 40:33.459
-No, it's OK.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.398
It's OK, Carlo.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.094
It's good.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.579
It feels good.

40:40.590 --> 40:42.262
It-- it feels good.

40:46.750 --> 40:47.739
-Shh.

40:47.750 --> 40:50.036
Shh.

40:50.040 --> 40:50.734
Shh.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.179
, mi amor.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.181
-Hi, mom.

41:48.190 --> 41:50.818
-Hi.

41:50.820 --> 41:55.940
-Listen, I-- I still
like volleyball.

41:55.940 --> 41:59.068
Ijust like hanging out
at the youth group more.

41:59.070 --> 42:01.231
-Why are you
telling me this now?

42:01.240 --> 42:02.844
-Well, I don't
want to lie to you.

42:02.850 --> 42:05.239
I'm not a liar.

42:05.250 --> 42:05.944
-OK.

42:09.890 --> 42:13.189
-What is it that you
do there at the church?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.963
-We talk.

42:14.970 --> 42:17.507
It's mostly just
music and snacks.

42:17.510 --> 42:18.909
But it's not that big of a deal.

42:18.920 --> 42:20.182
You guys should come sometime.

42:53.510 --> 42:55.501
-Are you mad at me?

42:59.000 --> 43:00.991
-No, of course not.

43:08.980 --> 43:11.881
Lucia?

43:11.890 --> 43:12.879
-It's done.

43:17.340 --> 43:19.558
-I knew it.

43:19.560 --> 43:20.891
I knew I'd end up dead.

43:20.900 --> 43:23.368
-You're not going to die, Nina.

43:23.370 --> 43:25.053
We'll figure this out.

43:25.060 --> 43:25.958
-How?

43:25.970 --> 43:28.359
-I don't know yet.

43:28.370 --> 43:29.906
Oleg says he's in
this for himself,

43:29.910 --> 43:32.879
and I believe there's a good
chance that might be true.

43:32.890 --> 43:35.597
And that can work for us.

43:35.600 --> 43:39.081
You have any idea how he might
have found out about you?

43:39.090 --> 43:40.478
-We're all spies.

43:44.130 --> 43:48.089
-Well, we'll get ahead
of him, I promise.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.705
But I need you to do
something for me first.

43:50.710 --> 43:52.610
Anything.

43:52.620 --> 43:54.599
-It's a Bureau requirement.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.477
I'm sorry.

43:56.480 --> 44:00.473
But I need you to
take a polygraph.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.118
-Yesterday you loved me.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.849
And today you call me a liar.

44:03.860 --> 44:07.136
-I need to show my supervisors
that they can trust you today.

44:07.140 --> 44:07.834
-They?

44:07.840 --> 44:08.693
You mean you.

44:08.700 --> 44:09.394
-Nina.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.004
-You don't trust me.

44:11.010 --> 44:13.171
I would never betray you.

44:13.180 --> 44:13.874
-I know that.

44:13.880 --> 44:15.108
-I have never betrayed you!

44:15.120 --> 44:18.442
Don't touch me.

44:18.450 --> 44:22.125
I'm finished with you.

44:22.130 --> 44:23.995
With all of this.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.989
I'm done.

45:14.970 --> 45:17.336
-You're not CIA.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.034
I had my doubts.

45:23.060 --> 45:24.288
-I prefer working
with people who

45:24.290 --> 45:26.758
believe in what we're doing.

45:26.760 --> 45:29.228
-You would.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.332
It's not a criticism.

45:30.340 --> 45:32.023
It's just an observation.

45:33.490 --> 45:38.382
-I don't care if people are
motivated by ideology or money.

45:38.390 --> 45:41.473
Money can be cleaner,
less complicated.

45:41.480 --> 45:46.759
Blackmail, however, seldom
leads to a happy conclusion.

45:46.760 --> 45:48.773
-If Larrick didn't
kill Emmett and Leanne,

45:48.780 --> 45:50.873
who do we look at next?

45:53.410 --> 45:54.104
-Me.

45:57.470 --> 45:58.801
I got involved with
someone while I

45:58.810 --> 46:00.949
was working with
Emmett and Leanne.

46:00.950 --> 46:09.301
I didn't plan on it, but
this business can be lonely.

46:09.310 --> 46:11.403
I didn't tell them who
I really was, of course.

46:16.450 --> 46:20.022
Until one day I did.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.749
I trusted him.

46:22.750 --> 46:27.392
I don't know that he betrayed
me, but ever since the murders,

46:27.400 --> 46:28.879
I've been plagued
with the thought

46:28.880 --> 46:32.281
that he told someone,
that I may have

46:32.290 --> 46:35.453
compromised the safety
of my own agents.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.156
No one else can understand
these relationships.

46:42.220 --> 46:46.168
If something were to happen
to you or your family--

46:46.170 --> 46:47.626
-We'll be OK.

46:52.970 --> 46:54.380
-I was wrong about Phillip.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.460
You're lucky to have him.

47:00.470 --> 47:01.368
Goodbye, Elizabeth.
