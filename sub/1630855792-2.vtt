Is he dead?
That’s obviously bad news

00:37.638 --> 00:38.872

Yes!

down there.

while I’m eating?

I gotta build my strength

01:51.778 --> 01:53.547

in these Games.

Everyone’s spine is staying
right inside their backs.

Your support is confusing.

the name "The Deliria Games."

And some kind of banner.
Just riffing here.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.937
- No longer confusing.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.705
- I suppose if they’re named
after me,

I’ll have to make an appearance
at the closing ceremonies.

02:49.369 --> 02:51.738
Zika the Brutal?
Papatonis the Destroyer?

02:51.805 --> 02:54.307
- These titles never mean
what they sound like.

02:54.374 --> 02:56.343
Maybe Zika is brutally honest.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.578
Maybe Papatonis destroyed
poverty.

of Penises?

her married name?

Anyway, don’t forget something:
you and I were enemies,

03:06.553 --> 03:08.755
then I invited you in,
and now we’re friends.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.990

As a friend,

03:10.057 --> 03:11.858

- Anything.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.794

is reproductive jelly.

I’m technically having sex
all the time.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.419
And just because
I’m not like you

05:19.486 --> 05:20.554
doesn’t mean I’m a bad monster.

06:04.231 --> 06:07.267
leather for spices,
spices for cattle,

06:07.334 --> 06:08.768
use the cattle for milk,

06:08.835 --> 06:11.905
which we then trade for,
wait for it, olives!

06:11.972 --> 06:15.275
And Krapopolis will be the city
that started it all.

I pay to get sarcasm, huh?

have gathered to watch

06:25.986 --> 06:28.822
whatever this is going to be.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.824
- Maybe it’s because our lives
only consist of work,

06:30.891 --> 06:32.259
suffering and death,

06:32.325 --> 06:34.394
but I for one
am excited to be here!

like that the whole time?

06:38.164 --> 06:41.234

It’s just how we talk.

stacking a bunch of rocks

07:00.053 --> 07:02.422

- My idiot brother, that’s who.

- Sounds like a real idiot.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.759

get to say that about him.

07:05.825 --> 07:06.993
Only I do.

07:35.655 --> 07:37.691
- Relax, Deliria. No shame.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.693
I once caught Athena
pretending to be the bull

07:39.759 --> 07:41.861
at her own sacrifice.
- Ha! Loser.

that your event

07:53.873 --> 07:55.842
I thought that was
a weirdly hot falcon.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.644
- And, front row,

you can look
because he loves it,

- Famous for being famous.

08:05.452 --> 08:08.288
Nobody likes him but he goes
where the heat is, so...

08:08.355 --> 08:11.057
- So the heat is here!
That’s tremendous.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.326

on your side.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.894
Super speed!

gone from a peaceful,

your royal friends--

08:29.809 --> 08:30.844
- They’ll be here.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.245
They’re probably
just entranced by

08:32.312 --> 08:34.180
the peaceful majesty
of my Games.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.449
- I don’t think the Games are
very peaceful anymore.

- Yeah.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.952

08:39.019 --> 08:41.121
more of a competitive
violence-driven thing.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.189
It’s kind of a hit.
Well, not kind of.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.624
It’s actually mostly hitting.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.292
[players shouting]

08:46.359 --> 08:48.528
- She’s undermining
world peace.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.730
And she must die!

08:52.799 --> 08:54.734
- Krapopolis has possession!

08:54.801 --> 08:55.935
- [grunts]

08:56.002 --> 08:58.538
[crowd cheering]

08:58.605 --> 08:59.606
Whoo!

08:59.672 --> 09:01.708
- Yeah! She came out of me!

09:01.775 --> 09:04.944
- Oh, good, Mum.
I need you to stop Stupendous.

09:05.011 --> 09:07.914
- Stop her?
The Games are a hit, dear.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.950
Look at that.
- [screeches]

09:11.017 --> 09:12.385
- I don’t know
what the hell that is.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.854
- Isn’t it obvious? Everyone
loves watching your sister

09:14.921 --> 09:16.256
beat other people’s brains out

09:16.322 --> 09:18.925
and it’s all thanks to me
in a roundabout sort of way.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.160
- That was never the point
of this.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.361
- And what was the point again?

09:21.428 --> 09:22.896
- To get the other kings to
listen to

09:22.962 --> 09:26.699
my inter-city peace whatever,
so I’m putting a stop to this.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.735
- Where did you inherit
your love of failure from?

09:28.802 --> 09:31.137
- Help me or get out of my way.
- I’ll help.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.139
- [screams]

09:33.206 --> 09:36.176
- It’s the kind of help
where you thank me later.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.545
- How much more can you learn
from this?

09:38.611 --> 09:40.980
- Everything.
I’m inventing something new.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.116
This is called profiling.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.185
We’re looking for
a smart but weak man,

09:45.251 --> 09:48.955
a skilled craftsman,
lonely, frustrated,

09:49.022 --> 09:52.158
works indoors,
socially awkward,

09:52.225 --> 09:53.993
just wants to be loved...

09:54.060 --> 09:56.496
[snaps]
But they won’t admit it.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.465
- Uh-huh.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.135
- They’re saying with these
murders, "screw you, everybody.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.403
"You think you’re so great

10:03.470 --> 10:05.238
"because you make out with
each other

10:05.305 --> 10:08.475
"and laugh together
and mock me behind my back?

10:08.541 --> 10:11.077
"But guess what, man?
Guess what?

10:11.144 --> 10:14.147
"You won’t be so sexy
if I fix you,

10:14.214 --> 10:18.351
if I make you look like
I feel!"

10:20.253 --> 10:21.488
Anyway, um...
[clears throat]

10:21.554 --> 10:23.123
That’s who we’re looking for.
What do you think?

10:23.189 --> 10:25.792
- I think this killer sounds
like a nice boy

10:25.859 --> 10:29.095
who’s just misunderstood.
- Well, I think he’s garbage.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.498
- Don’t say that.
- We need to catch him!

10:31.564 --> 10:33.967
- Maybe he needs to be
caught...in a hug.

10:34.033 --> 10:36.202
- What is wrong with you?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.073
I think I know where the killer
will strike next!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.141
- That’s good.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.209
That’s the first step to
stopping.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.714
- Yeah, I know.
- I know you know.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.582
- I think I’m gonna do
this part alone.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.285
- You can feel the energy
in Krapopolis

10:52.352 --> 10:54.320
as the Deliria Games enters

10:54.387 --> 10:56.289
whatever comes after
the beginning.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.591
Measurements of time are
not really a thing yet.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.326
- And we’re giving you
the play by play,

11:00.393 --> 11:03.163
made possible by
Yanni’s sound cones,

11:03.229 --> 11:05.398
cones of wood
that make you loud!

11:05.465 --> 11:07.167
- You’ve got to be kidding me.

11:07.233 --> 11:10.670
[players grunting]

11:10.737 --> 11:11.738
- Smart defense.

11:11.804 --> 11:13.940
- You gotta spend rocks
to gain rocks

11:14.007 --> 11:16.176
and this is a game of rocks.

11:16.242 --> 11:20.079
Stupendous is going for
the point!

11:20.513 --> 11:22.482
- Rock, Krapopolis!
[crowd cheering]

11:22.549 --> 11:25.018
- You gotta think
King Tyrannis is awful proud

11:25.084 --> 11:26.586
of his big sister right now.

11:26.653 --> 11:28.688
- [screaming]

11:28.755 --> 11:29.656
- Whoa!

11:29.722 --> 11:31.457
Hey, are you
Stupendous’ brother?

11:31.524 --> 11:34.594
- No, she’s my sister.
My sister!

11:36.596 --> 11:38.798
- Hi, son. I bought snacks.
- What do you want, Dad?

11:38.865 --> 11:42.368
- To see how things were
progressing with your "case."

11:42.435 --> 11:44.637
- Why did you say it like that?
- No reason.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.273
So based on your understanding
of the killer,

11:47.340 --> 11:49.175
you feel this might be a place
they might--

11:49.242 --> 11:51.544
- I don’t think
he’d kill anyone here

11:51.611 --> 11:54.514
but I do think he’ll be
revealing himself very soon.

11:54.581 --> 11:57.217
- That’s good, son.
Take your time.

11:57.283 --> 11:58.651
Actually, don’t take your time.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.153
You’re safe here.
You can just say it.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.454
- I wanted it to be a surprise.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.256
- I don’t think at this point
it will be.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.591
- Oh, really?
So you know who it is?

12:04.657 --> 12:05.758
- Yes, I do.
- Tell me.

12:05.825 --> 12:07.527
- I think it’s important
you say it.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.263
- Say it on three.
One, two...

12:10.330 --> 12:11.698
the blacksmith.
- My beautiful son!

12:11.764 --> 12:14.567
- Wait, what?
Why would Tyrannis kill people?

12:14.634 --> 12:17.170
He’s already king.
- My other son.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.205
- Stupendous is a guy?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.241
Me? Dad, what the hell?

12:21.307 --> 12:23.443
It’s the blacksmith, you knob!

12:23.509 --> 12:25.311
- Son, you don’t have to be
ashamed.

12:25.378 --> 12:27.180
I support you.
- As a murderer?

12:27.247 --> 12:28.615
- As whatever you are.

12:28.681 --> 12:30.950
- Then you can support me as
a scholar of anatomy

12:31.017 --> 12:32.452
on the trail of a killer!

12:32.518 --> 12:34.354
- Well, no,
because that’s crazy.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.223
Just admit you’re a horrific
ghoul man from the deep

12:37.290 --> 12:38.758
and let’s get
the hell out of town.

12:38.825 --> 12:42.295
- You are the worst father.
- And you are a great murderer.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.998
I love you! Don’t get caught!

12:45.064 --> 12:46.299
[players grunting]

12:46.366 --> 12:48.034
[crowd cheering]

12:48.101 --> 12:52.872
[chanting] Stupendous!
Stupendous! Stupendous!

12:52.939 --> 12:54.440
- Excuse me, coming through.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.376
- Sorry, but we’re about to do
a thing where

12:56.442 --> 12:59.178
we all take turns standing up
in kind of a wave.

12:59.245 --> 13:02.181
It’s gonna really give meaning
to being a crowd at an event.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.483
- Do you know who I am?

13:03.549 --> 13:05.318
- I don’t care if
you’re the king of Krapopolis!

13:05.385 --> 13:06.853
- I am the king of Krapopolis!

13:06.919 --> 13:09.555
- What an excellent way for me
to illustrate my point.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.224
Whoa!

13:12.759 --> 13:15.528
- [grunts]

13:15.595 --> 13:17.363
- Put it down, please.
Thank you.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.598
Put the rock down.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.933
Stupendous,
for once in your life,

13:21.000 --> 13:23.036
stop sabotaging me!

13:23.102 --> 13:25.738
- I never sabotaged--
- You’re doing it now!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.940
Put it down.

13:28.007 --> 13:29.709
Hi. Thank you, everybody.

13:29.776 --> 13:32.045
I’m Tyrannis.
These are my Games.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.813
But there’s been
some confusion.

13:33.880 --> 13:36.916
They’ve gotten a little violent
and a little too competitive.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.284
But here’s the good news.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.387
Before that happened, we’ve
proved something important:

13:41.454 --> 13:45.391
that we can all get together
in peace and have fun.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.894
So what I’d like to do is
invite my fellow kings up to

13:47.960 --> 13:51.431
the luxury skybox and have an
exciting talk about the future

13:51.497 --> 13:53.933
while these folks go back to
playing nicely.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.768
What do you think?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.370
- Riot!

13:57.437 --> 14:00.773
[crowd roaring]
- Whoopsie.

14:02.842 --> 14:08.748
[citizens shouting]

14:12.018 --> 14:12.952
- Baby?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.754
- It’s not a secret
riot shelter.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.122
- Nobody’s ever said that about

14:16.189 --> 14:18.491
a place that wasn’t
a secret riot shelter.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.059
- It’s a royal reading nook.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.295
- There’s no written language
so there are no books.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.629
- I’m waiting for them.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.964
That’s why the shelves are
filled with food, supplies,

14:25.031 --> 14:26.232
and one dose of fatal poison.

14:26.299 --> 14:28.601
- Sugar-booger,
you’re all grown up now.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.037
You can’t just hide under
your blanky-wanky.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.606
- Why are you pretending we had
cute names for me or blankets?

14:33.673 --> 14:34.841
I don’t even think I had
a blanket.

14:34.907 --> 14:37.310
- Because I raised you
to be strong.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.745
- You barely raised me.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.247
- Right, you’re talking in
circles, booby-nooby.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.150
Your city is being invaded and
you’re sitting here sulking.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.385
- I’m not sulking!

14:45.451 --> 14:47.220
Maybe they deserve to be
invaded.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.189
- You don’t mean that.
Krapopolis needs you.

14:50.256 --> 14:52.959
Mumma’s ass-kicking
closing number needs you.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.961
- Naturally,
this is all about you.

14:55.027 --> 14:58.598
- Oh, like it’s not about you.
- Huh, yeah.

14:58.664 --> 15:01.000
I mean, I’ve been
convincing myself that

15:01.067 --> 15:02.735
I put on these Games for
a noble purpose

15:02.802 --> 15:05.772
but the truth is, I only wanted
to prove that my way is right

15:05.838 --> 15:08.040
and I wanted it so badly
I risked everything

15:08.107 --> 15:10.476
just to keep my sister from
getting the glory.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.345
I’m no better than you!

15:12.412 --> 15:15.214
- Oh, please. You’re barely
scratching the surface.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.416
- Thank you, Mother.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.419
Thank you for your shining,
terrible example.

15:19.485 --> 15:20.787
Now take me to Stupendous.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.355
- You know you’re very lucky
I’m doing a lot of

15:22.422 --> 15:24.757
magic hour dependent light work
in my number.

15:24.824 --> 15:27.326
Hop onto Mumma’s shoulders.

15:27.393 --> 15:30.263
And if anyone sees us,
I’m an ordinary ostrich.

15:33.232 --> 15:34.834
- You’re gonna want thumbs
for this.

15:34.901 --> 15:37.103
- I’m so happy
you invited me in.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.806
These are amazing.
What do you call them again?

15:39.872 --> 15:41.507
- Horseshoes.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.910
It’s a little outside the box

15:43.976 --> 15:47.313
but as a blacksmith,
it’s my job to think different.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.649
- My son is the same way.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.852
I just wish he was
more sociable, like you.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.022
Do you have kids?
- No, I’m pretty isolated.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.858
I only talk to people
when I’ve got work to do.

15:58.925 --> 16:01.427
Other hoof.
- The similarities continue.

16:01.494 --> 16:04.764
Yes, you both work alone,
you’re both skilled craftsmen.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.699
Distinctive nails you use.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.035
I feel I’ve seen them
around town.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.772
- Yes, they hold up
quite a bit of weight.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.341
But I guess
you already know that.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.076
- You’re the killer!
That’s wonderful.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.612
- It’s not supposed to be.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.548
- No, you don’t understand.
See, I thought it was my son.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.983
- [grunting]
- Oh! OK, ouch!

16:24.050 --> 16:26.786
But still, such a relief.
- [laughs]

16:26.853 --> 16:29.388
- Blacksmith! I’ve caught you.
Dad!

16:29.455 --> 16:33.926
- Hippo, I’m slain.
But guess who by? Not you.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.362
I’m so proud that you’re only
into corpses

16:36.429 --> 16:37.830
other people killed.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.832
- Hold on. I’ve studied enough
to know that

16:39.899 --> 16:41.267
if I push down on
this squirty thing...

16:41.334 --> 16:42.869
- [cries out]
- That’s good.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.504
If you were dying,
that wouldn’t hurt.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.038
- So you really were learning

16:46.105 --> 16:47.840
and are not just
a creepy death perv.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.475
- It can be both things.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.776
- I love you, son.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.312
After I’m gone,
I want you to go ahead

16:53.379 --> 16:56.682
and dig around inside of me.
Just go nuts in there.

16:56.749 --> 16:58.017
- You’re not going anywhere!

16:58.084 --> 17:00.419
But if you do,
thank you, I will do that.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.921
That’s very exciting.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.025
- [screams, grunts]

17:06.092 --> 17:08.261
- Mummy’s on a schedule!

17:08.327 --> 17:11.597
- So what’s the strong person
equivalent of "I’m sorry"?

17:11.664 --> 17:14.767
Do I jab a sharp stick in
my eye or are words enough?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.335
- For the apology you owe me,

17:16.402 --> 17:19.071
that stick will need to get
shoved way further south.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.374
- I get it. I’m always acting
like I’m evolved and

17:21.440 --> 17:23.776
you’re a regressive barbarian,
which you are,

17:23.843 --> 17:25.678
and I keep trying to
convince myself that

17:25.745 --> 17:27.747
I can force people into
a future I want,

17:27.813 --> 17:29.115
one where I get to feel safe.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.317
But the truth is,
this is your world,

17:31.384 --> 17:33.119
and you deserve to be
celebrated.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.487
- Can’t really argue with that.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.821
But in a million years,

17:35.888 --> 17:38.257
weak sissies like you will
probably be running things.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.459
That’s why I came to
help you build this city.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.129
- Great. We both agree that
in a million years, I win.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.765
So now can we go finish
the Games and save the city?

17:45.831 --> 17:47.967
- Oh, OK.
But if we pass a sharp stick,

17:48.034 --> 17:50.436
you still owe me an apology.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.805
- Mum, can you help us get
everyone back in the stands?

17:52.872 --> 17:56.442
- Finally. It’s about time.
You can only rehearse so much.

17:56.509 --> 17:59.478
I think one of my backup
dancers is about to give birth.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.014
Hail, bitches!

18:02.081 --> 18:04.750
- It’s hailing everywhere but
over the amphitheater!

18:04.817 --> 18:07.186
- What an oddly specific
weather pattern!

18:07.253 --> 18:08.220
Oof!

18:12.692 --> 18:15.494
- OK, glad to see everyone is
safe and sound.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.797
- A hailstone killed my kid!

18:17.863 --> 18:19.899
- Unfortunate,
but most kids die.

18:19.966 --> 18:21.000
That’s why we have a lot.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.502
[crowd booing]

18:23.569 --> 18:26.706
- Right now all that matters is
the rock ball game is back on!

18:26.772 --> 18:29.241
Perhaps I wasn’t clear that
stopping the Games was

18:29.308 --> 18:30.376
just a diversion,

18:30.443 --> 18:32.578
not the whiny baby tantrum
it seemed like.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.880
In the future,
we will call it a halftime.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.582
Now, go kick some ass.
- [chuckles]

18:36.649 --> 18:38.851
[crowd cheering]

18:38.918 --> 18:40.853
- Room for one more?
- [groans]

18:40.920 --> 18:42.788
Are you gonna ruin this
by talking?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.824
- The only thing
I’ll be talking is trash

18:44.890 --> 18:48.361
because my sister is going to
wipe the floor with your guys.

18:48.427 --> 18:52.598
[players grunting]

18:52.665 --> 18:54.600
[crowd cheering]

18:54.667 --> 18:57.637
- With time winding down,
this could be the last play.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.272
It would take a miracle for
Stupendous to pull this off.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.308
- But we do live in
an era of gods

19:02.375 --> 19:04.010
and often irrational magic,

19:04.076 --> 19:06.112
so literally anything
is possible.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.014
- Come on, Stupe,
you can do it!

19:08.080 --> 19:11.550
- [grunting]

19:11.617 --> 19:12.918
- Krapopolis wins!

19:12.985 --> 19:17.390
[crowd cheering loudly]

19:17.456 --> 19:18.658
- That’s my sister!

19:18.724 --> 19:19.792
- Yeah!

19:19.859 --> 19:21.360
- All right!
- Ah, yeah!

19:21.427 --> 19:24.163
- Well, these games were a lot
more fun than I had expected.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.132
- And at this point,
I’m probably drunk enough

19:26.198 --> 19:28.801
to listen to whatever boring
stuff you might want to say.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.636
- Wow. OK, this is fantastic.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.038
You’re gonna love
my presentation.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.105
Just need to get my model.
One sec.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.807
You all stay right here!

19:34.874 --> 19:35.941
- [laughing]

19:36.008 --> 19:39.078
[all groaning and choking]

19:39.145 --> 19:40.646
- Wait, before you die,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.314
would you have been amenable
to a long-term

19:42.381 --> 19:44.550
multi-city alliance?
- [groans]

19:44.617 --> 19:46.886
- You would not believe
the line at the kebab stand.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.320
What did I miss?

19:48.387 --> 19:50.890
- Tyrannis, you’ll never guess
who the killer is.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.325
- The blacksmith?
- How did you--oh.

19:53.392 --> 19:55.094
The good news is that
I’ve learned enough about

19:55.161 --> 19:58.130
human anatomy to make this
all look like an accident.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.267
- Closing number time!
Remember the new combination.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.470
"Kick ball change, pop.
Booty, booty, booty, booty."

20:04.537 --> 20:08.240
Hello, Krapopolis!

20:08.307 --> 20:10.509
And what are you--you are not
having that baby now!

20:10.576 --> 20:12.111
[baby crying]
Suck it back in!

20:12.178 --> 20:14.280
- I’m proud of you, Stupendous.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.649
- For being amazing?
Kind of comes natural.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.883
- Well, yes, for that.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.619
But also because you did
the one thing I never could,

20:20.686 --> 20:23.255
made these games about
something other than Mum.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.191
- Oh, for the love of--
just dance around--

20:25.257 --> 20:27.426
dance around it!
Better than that!

20:29.161 --> 20:31.163
- Sup? Sup? How you doing?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.466
- Broseidon!
- Oh, what’s up?

20:33.532 --> 20:35.434
- Who is that?
- Broseidon.

20:35.501 --> 20:37.570
- Am I supposed to care?
- I don’t know.

20:37.636 --> 20:39.872
- He’s just one of those guys,
famous for being famous.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.941
There’s no "there" there.
- Hey, who said that?

20:42.007 --> 20:43.375
Ay, who’s talking smack?

20:43.442 --> 20:44.777
Who’s judging me?
You don’t know me.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.846
- Who’re you talking to?
- Who are you talking to?

20:46.912 --> 20:49.448
- Why are you upset?
- Why are you upset?

20:49.515 --> 20:51.016
You wanna dance with Broseidon?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.518
- I don’t understand
what’s going on.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.386
- That’s right, you don’t.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.088
None of you do. Come on.

20:56.155 --> 20:58.457
- Man, Broseidon’s a dick.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.260
- Ay, who said that?
You people don’t know me!

21:01.327 --> 21:02.895
I’m sorry I’m popular!

21:02.962 --> 21:04.964
Doesn’t mean
I’m here for your abuse!

21:05.030 --> 21:06.432
I’m a human being.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.534
I’m Poseidon’s nephew
but I’m human!

21:08.601 --> 21:10.669
I have a story,
I have feelings!

21:10.736 --> 21:14.206
I had a messed up childhood!
- Ah, boo-hoo!

21:14.273 --> 21:16.876
- Nobody knows my pain!

21:16.942 --> 21:19.545
- And nobody would know
Broseidon’s pain.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.081
And his pain continued
forever.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.884
And that is why
we have four seasons.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.052
- Did you get any of that?

21:27.119 --> 21:29.088
[dramatic whoosh]

21:29.155 --> 21:30.689
- Bento.
[cheering]
