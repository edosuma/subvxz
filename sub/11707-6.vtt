09:26.432 --> 09:27.833
- 'Hello?'
- Hey, babe.

09:31.203 --> 09:34.941
Um, I just walked
around and went out

09:35.007 --> 09:36.842
with the girls and that's it.

09:36.909 --> 09:40.413
I just want to tell you that you
are the best guy I've ever met.

09:40.479 --> 09:43.115
You make me happy,
you make me laugh

09:43.182 --> 09:45.551
{\an8}and I want
to suck your butt.

09:45.618 --> 09:46.552
{\an8}[burps]

09:53.292 --> 09:56.128
I didn't mean that.

09:56.195 --> 09:57.463
{\an8}I'm sorry.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.532
{\an8}I'm sorry, that's me.
I'm sorry, that's me.

09:59.598 --> 10:01.000
You know that's me,
I'm sorry.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.836
{\an1}I'm trying to change,
I'm trying. Sorry.

10:03.903 --> 10:06.172

10:06.238 --> 10:09.308
{\an7}He is like, very like,
I would say self-conscious

10:09.375 --> 10:11.911
{\an8}but he's always worrying about
what everybody thinks of him.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.579
{\an8}<i>Me, I'm the total opposite</i>

10:13.646 --> 10:15.047

{\an8}I peed my pants in public,
I'm still not embarrassed.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.584
{\an8}So I mean, come on.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.187
{\an1}You know that's how I am.
I always talk to you like this.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.022
{\an1}And, um, I fell like I'm scared
to even, like

10:23.089 --> 10:24.557
'be myself, talking to you'

10:24.623 --> 10:26.225
{\an7}'cause you're gonna get mad
if I say something.

10:33.032 --> 10:34.934
{\an1}If you're worried that much,
then don't come visit

{\an1}'I'm getting off the phone,
I'm annoyed.'

10:38.571 --> 10:39.805
{\an1}- Thank you.
- 'Why are you annoyed?'

10:39.872 --> 10:41.640
- 'You started it.'
- Bye.

10:43.175 --> 10:44.110
Lame.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.419
Oh, it's so annoying, Ron.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.820
{\an7}I don't know
how to deal with this

10:54.887 --> 10:57.857
{\an7}I've never really been
in love like this before.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.159
It's just annoying,
because he's like

11:00.226 --> 11:01.694
{\an1}I call him, and I'm like,
"Ooh," I'm like

11:01.761 --> 11:03.229
"When you come here,
I'm gonna jump on you

11:03.295 --> 11:04.997
{\an1}and, like hump you.
I can't wait to see you."

11:05.064 --> 11:06.432
He's like, "Don't do that."

11:06.499 --> 11:08.501
Like he gets embarrassed
over the littlest things.

11:08.567 --> 11:11.270
{\an1}If I scream in a bar, when I go,
say we're in a bar, I go

11:11.337 --> 11:14.273
{\an1}"Shots!" he walks away,
'cause he gets embarrassed.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.775
But that's you.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.943
{\an1}I know, and I feel like
I'm not being myself, like...

11:18.010 --> 11:20.946
{\an1}Don't change yourself
for someone else.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.214
'Take it from me.'

'You don't want to have
to be in a relationship'

11:23.849 --> 11:25.051
'where you have to
stomp on eggshells.'

11:25.117 --> 11:26.819
He's acting like a ***.

11:26.886 --> 11:29.055
"You better *** get down
and start sucking my toes

11:29.121 --> 11:30.589
"with some nutella on it."

11:30.656 --> 11:32.792
{\an1}I'm like, "You sound like
an idiot, just stop talking."

11:32.858 --> 11:35.428
{\an1}"Put nutella on my toes
and suck 'em right now, Jionni."

11:35.494 --> 11:37.730
- Well, not my toes.
- 'Aw, come on.'

11:51.077 --> 11:52.111
- Alright.
- 'Alright.'

11:52.178 --> 11:53.646
'Oh, I can wash it
in the tub.'

11:53.712 --> 11:55.548
In the tub, alright.
Tub works.

11:55.614 --> 11:57.850
Yay! I'll wash it,
and then...

11:57.917 --> 11:59.218
- I'll gel it.
- You got shampoo?
