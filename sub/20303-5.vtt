00:01.084 --> 00:03.628
NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues<i>...</i>

00:03.712 --> 00:05.255
(grunting)

00:07.340 --> 00:08.758
I may be with child.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.552
A little Esterhaus.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.388
It is a little Esterhaus?

00:13.471 --> 00:14.806
(speaking Spanish)

00:14.889 --> 00:16.266
That's him! That's the brother!

00:16.349 --> 00:18.059
(gunfire)

00:19.060 --> 00:19.936
I don't mind telling you

00:20.020 --> 00:22.188
-I'm more than a little upset.
-What about?

00:22.272 --> 00:25.108
Your son has been shoplifting.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.444
Hold it.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.446
Don't do it!

00:34.576 --> 00:37.328
(indistinct chatter)

00:40.874 --> 00:43.334
Item ten as regards canines...

00:43.418 --> 00:45.045
(officers barking)

00:45.128 --> 00:49.299
The, um, uh, poop scoop law

00:49.382 --> 00:50.633
goes into effect today.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.636
Yeah. That's<i> The People v. Belker.</i>
I hear he's appealing.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.180
(all laughing)

00:58.183 --> 01:01.728
To wit, any person causing or permitting
any domestic canine

01:01.811 --> 01:03.563
to evacuate on a public sidewalk

01:03.646 --> 01:08.151
without promptly and substantially
removing said evacuation from same

01:08.234 --> 01:11.196
shall be guilty of a class-C misdemeanor.

01:11.279 --> 01:13.406
What if he removes it,
but not substantially, Sarge?

01:13.490 --> 01:16.367
-(all laughing)
-ESTERHAUS: Item 11.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.287
We have six more complaints
from Decker Avenue merchants

01:19.370 --> 01:22.373
concerning vending machine
coin-box rip-offs.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.709
Somebody's doing a lot
of nickel-and-diming out there.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.419
There's an unofficial reward for the doer

01:26.503 --> 01:28.922
that puts the alleged perpetrator
out of business.

01:29.881 --> 01:33.343
An evening's free play of Space Invaders
at Decker Avenue Playland.

01:33.426 --> 01:36.179
-(all exclaiming, hooting)
-LARUE: Hot diggetty!

01:36.805 --> 01:40.433
Item 12: A truce has been reached
with the night shift...

01:41.184 --> 01:44.646
regarding the use and misuse
of the precinct refrigerator.

01:45.313 --> 01:46.773
In accordance therewith,

01:46.856 --> 01:50.693
said refrigerator last evening was cleaned
out of all unauthorized foodstuffs

01:50.777 --> 01:54.280
alleged to have been present
therein for a length of time

01:54.364 --> 01:56.324
longer than five days.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.827
-MAN: Thank God.
-(murmuring, chattering)

01:58.910 --> 02:00.787
ESTERHAUS:
If I may inject a personal note.

02:01.913 --> 02:06.126
Guys, we're all willing to look
the other way vis-à-vis brown-bagging it,

02:06.209 --> 02:08.711
given the current economic realities.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.798
But, to the anonymous owner
of the marinated artichoke

02:11.881 --> 02:13.716
and liver paté on whole wheat...

02:13.800 --> 02:15.885
-(groaning)
-...in the rear of the third shelf

02:15.969 --> 02:18.012
that had taken on a life of its own...

02:18.096 --> 02:20.306
(officers laughing)

02:20.723 --> 02:22.809
...have a little understanding, would you,

02:23.601 --> 02:26.604
odor-wise, hygiene-wise and otherwise.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.565
(chattering loudly)

02:28.648 --> 02:30.024
All right, last item:

02:30.316 --> 02:33.194
be cognizant that Monday Night Football
is on tonight,

02:33.528 --> 02:36.906
which means we'll be missing
15 percent of the night shift.

02:38.283 --> 02:42.287
Be equally cognizant the welfare eagle
flies on Mondays,

02:43.079 --> 02:46.040
which means our local muggers
will be out in force.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.919
Therefore, we have
double shift assignments.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.129
(officers groaning)

02:51.212 --> 02:55.466
Bates, Coffey, Shamsky,
Figiliano, Williams, Obradovich.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.595
All right, let's roll!

02:59.470 --> 03:00.305
And, hey...

03:01.556 --> 03:02.390
Hey!

03:02.974 --> 03:04.726
Let's be careful out there.

03:05.018 --> 03:05.852
You got it.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.812
What if the eagle does it on the sidewalk?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.689
(chattering continues)

03:09.772 --> 03:12.108
Someone's scarf. You're gonna be cold.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.986
So, what do you say we put it
in cruise control today, partner?

03:15.069 --> 03:18.323
Like California cops,
put on a pair of them glasses,

03:18.740 --> 03:21.784
put the arm out the window like this
and smile at everybody.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.953
Don't cause any personal conflict at all.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.080
Oh, you got a new squeeze.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.876
I tell you, Bobby, this woman is flat-out
kinky when it comes to football.

03:29.959 --> 03:32.921
Might be those pants they have
that highlight their what-have-yous.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.550
All I know is that on Monday nights,
she is hotter than a Model T coil.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.345
And the rest of the week,
she is drier than a gutter snowbird.

03:40.428 --> 03:41.304
Oh!

03:41.387 --> 03:42.513
So I'm gonna cook up a pot

03:42.597 --> 03:44.766
-of that spaghetti "bogonese"...
-Yeah?

03:44.849 --> 03:48.895
...and I'm gonna squat down on her
velour couch in front of her 26-incher...

03:49.354 --> 03:50.855
What I'm pointin' out here is this,

03:50.939 --> 03:53.316
I cannot afford to get stuck
in night court

03:53.399 --> 03:56.569
while the rest of civilized America
sits in front of their television sets...

03:56.653 --> 03:59.906
watching Joe Theismann, as in Heisman,
fill the air with footballs.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.408
All right, who's the joker?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.245
I had a Nova and cream cheese on bagel

04:05.328 --> 04:07.956
with a slice of Bermuda in the fridge
on the second shelf.

04:09.082 --> 04:09.916
Where's Belker?

04:10.375 --> 04:12.835
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:14.837
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:18.758
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:18.841 --> 04:20.343
(sirens wailing)

04:25.807 --> 04:27.809
(theme music playing)

06:11.496 --> 06:14.123
You know, my guidance counselor
should have told me in high school, man,

06:14.207 --> 06:16.250
I got acting talent up the wazoo.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.504
Oh, yeah? What kind of talent you got
in that bottle there, lover, huh?

06:20.129 --> 06:23.132
Hey, I poured the top half of this
into the sink, Neal.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.842
-Mm-hmm.
-(car horn honks)

06:26.302 --> 06:28.054
Hey. Hey, that's him coming out.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.562
WASHINGTON: Yeah, looks like
he's heading for the underpass.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.940
Tell you what.
Let's nail him at the other end.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.484
-Hey. You got the bread?
-Yeah, I got it.

06:41.567 --> 06:42.902
Hey, just don't make it too blatant, okay?

06:42.985 --> 06:45.655
Hey, I'm telling you, man,
<i>People v. Fernandez.</i>

06:45.738 --> 06:47.407
Dollar collars are dynamite.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.242
Besides, I gotta make it a little blatant.

06:49.325 --> 06:53.079
I don't look like an 82-year-old lame,
blind broad trying to cross the street.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.415
Yeah, you got that right. You look worse.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.906
-Hey, bro, you got the time?
-(snoring)

07:32.410 --> 07:33.995
Freeze, my man! Police.

07:34.287 --> 07:37.165
-(LaRue groans)
-Halt! Police!

07:39.041 --> 07:40.126
Police! Halt!

07:44.797 --> 07:46.549
(screams) Oh, God!

07:47.717 --> 07:49.218
(grunting, yelling)

07:50.094 --> 07:52.638
Come here, turkey! Get down here!

07:52.722 --> 07:55.975
-(man screaming)
-Oh, man. It's your knee, isn't it?

07:56.058 --> 07:59.479
-It's cool, baby. It's cool.
-I was just trying to help the old dude!

07:59.562 --> 08:01.272
-He was losing his money!
-Aw, shut up.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.608
-LARUE: Oh, man.
-(groaning)

08:04.942 --> 08:07.069
-He was losin' his money!
-LARUE: Scum! Shut up!

08:07.487 --> 08:09.363
-(cuckoo clock cuckooing)
-Here I am,

08:09.822 --> 08:12.033
carrying a wire against Roy Snyder's goon,

08:12.283 --> 08:14.911
and you don't even know if the--
if the glue is waterproof.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.496
Mick, I told you I sweat a lot.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.582
I know it's gonna fall off.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.418
You think I like doing this?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.378
Morris, calm down.

08:24.462 --> 08:25.713
MORRIS: Calm down, he says.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.341
Mick, I owe 1,300 bucks
at 20 percent a week.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.219
Morris, for a lousy 1,300,
what are they gonna do?

08:31.302 --> 08:33.679
They're not gonna go after your family
or anything.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.432
My family? What about me?

08:37.308 --> 08:40.102
Mick, do you know what a 10:00 appointment
means to these guys?

08:40.853 --> 08:42.688
A 10:00 appointment means-- means bones.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.900
-Ribs.
-BELKER: Internal organs.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.402
-(banging on door)
-(bell dings)

08:48.945 --> 08:49.862
Oh, God.

08:50.821 --> 08:51.656
He's here.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.995
-(banging on door)
-(bell dinging)

09:25.022 --> 09:28.818
So, Morris, what's it gonna be?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.028
Cash or broken bones?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.948
Oh, well, that's what I--
I was just thinking about.

09:34.323 --> 09:38.578
I mean, let's face it, Stanley,
I-- I already got broken bones.

09:39.161 --> 09:42.123
Oh, so you're gonna pay. That's good.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.833
Well, that's not what I-- I meant.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.380
I mean, not-- not exactly.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.884
Nice plaster job.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.971
How many places it break, anyway?

09:59.056 --> 10:01.309
Multiple, uh, multiple fractures, Stanley.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.019
STANLEY: Oh, what a shame.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.355
I swear, Morris,
I always go for the clean break.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.942
Okay, just-- just take your hands off--
off the cast.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.446
You're sweating like a pig, Morris.

10:13.529 --> 10:16.073
Don't. You'll break the wire.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.034
-The what?
-Wire!

10:18.534 --> 10:20.244
I'm wearing a wire, Stanley.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.121
Look, I just wanna show it to you

10:22.204 --> 10:25.041
so you won't-- So you won't think
I'm pulling a fast one. Okay?

10:25.750 --> 10:28.085
I'll yank it out-- yank it out for you.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.339
-Well, now we're even-steven.
-Come on.

10:32.131 --> 10:33.716
Police! You freeze it, hairbag!

10:34.050 --> 10:37.011
Oh, no! No, Stanley! No! Oh, no! No!

10:42.391 --> 10:43.809
(grunting)

10:51.651 --> 10:54.195
-(alarm bell ringing)
-(tires screech)

11:04.497 --> 11:06.165
You back off! (screams)

11:12.755 --> 11:13.964
(growling)

11:18.969 --> 11:20.554
(growling continues)

11:22.723 --> 11:24.558
(Bates, Coffey yelling, grunting)

11:32.608 --> 11:33.651
-Back up!
-Uh-uh.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.612
Come on, back up.
Dispatch. Officer in need.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.866
Request immediate backup, 600 block,
Jefferson Avenue. Officer will assist.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.910
There is no way
that I'm gonna get involved in this.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.578
I'm gonna tell ya that going in.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.913
I don't mind unofficial assist,

11:45.996 --> 11:48.332
but there is no way I'm gonna get stuck
with something like this

11:48.416 --> 11:51.877
and have to spend the entire night
cooling my heels in night court.

11:52.628 --> 11:53.879
(tires screech)

11:54.380 --> 11:57.508
(Bates shouting, groaning)

11:57.925 --> 12:01.554
Well, flog my dolphin! Look at that woman.
She's a physical phenomenon!

12:01.637 --> 12:02.930
HILL: What are you gonna do,
just stand there and announce?

12:03.013 --> 12:06.225
I think the situation is pretty
much under control, don't you?

12:06.308 --> 12:09.353
-Hey! Hey! Get back!
-(grunting, groaning)

12:11.772 --> 12:12.857
Right on!

12:12.940 --> 12:15.067
Right on!<i> Bravissimo!</i>

12:15.401 --> 12:17.570
<i>Bravissimo! </i>Right on,
brothers and sisters!

12:17.987 --> 12:20.448
-(Bates yelling)
-(grunting, yelling continue)

12:32.752 --> 12:35.129
Oh, you look radiant.

12:35.921 --> 12:36.922
Oh, Phil.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.674
Parakeet, what's the matter?

12:40.426 --> 12:41.886
Could we speak privately?

12:55.316 --> 12:56.859
I may be with child.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.403
With child?

13:01.822 --> 13:02.656
Pregnant.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.658
Pregnant? You?

13:04.742 --> 13:07.119
Oh, don't be upset, Phil. I--

13:07.453 --> 13:10.122
-Are you sure?
-No, not yet.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.585
But my body
is an incredibly fine instrument.

13:14.668 --> 13:17.505
Of course it is. It's magnificent.

13:17.588 --> 13:19.048
No, no. (laughs)

13:19.131 --> 13:22.802
What I mean is, there are those of us...

13:22.885 --> 13:25.554
who run like perfectly-oiled watches,

13:25.971 --> 13:29.809
year after year, tick after tick,

13:29.892 --> 13:34.772
and when there is the slightest variation
in bodily rhythm,

13:35.147 --> 13:36.315
as there is now...

13:36.899 --> 13:40.194
Oh, darling, you are upset. I sense it.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.988
No. No, not at all.<i> Au contraire.</i>

13:43.072 --> 13:46.534
In fact, Grace, this is wonderful.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.328
-A wee one.
-(sighs)

13:50.162 --> 13:51.747
A little Esterhaus.

13:53.457 --> 13:55.376
It is a little Esterhaus?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.796
Oh, there's no doubt about it, Phil.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.714
If I am pregnant,

14:02.508 --> 14:03.342
it's yours.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.637
-Oh, Grace! It would be a miracle!
-(laughs)

14:06.720 --> 14:09.181
-(smooching)
-No, wait-- No, wait a minute, Phil.

14:09.932 --> 14:10.766
(sighs)

14:11.350 --> 14:14.854
I'm not sure exactly how I feel about it.

14:15.729 --> 14:18.357
I mean, a-- a baby now.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.859
Us.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.028
Grace, think of it.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.656
A progeny of our own.

14:27.658 --> 14:31.829
Phillip Freemason Esterhaus Jr.

14:33.038 --> 14:34.206
(chuckling)

14:34.498 --> 14:38.294
We could enroll him in Sand Creek's
nude nursery encounter group.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.170
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.047
(laughing)

14:45.885 --> 14:49.930
You really want to call him
Phillip Freemason Esterhaus Jr.?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.808
(both laughing)

14:58.480 --> 15:00.149
Come on, Stanley. Please?

15:00.566 --> 15:04.028
Come on, move! Move! Stand there!

15:05.821 --> 15:09.825
This guy is probably gonna need
some stitches and a tetanus shot.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.535
All right, listen up.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.704
You have the right to remain silent.

15:13.787 --> 15:15.039
If you give up the right to remain silent,

15:15.122 --> 15:17.374
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.792
You have the right
to speak with an attorney

15:18.876 --> 15:21.128
and have an attorney present
during questioning if you so desire.

15:21.211 --> 15:25.007
If you cannot afford one, an attorney will
be appointed for you before questioning.

15:25.090 --> 15:25.925
You understand?

15:28.260 --> 15:29.803
Do you understand?

15:30.554 --> 15:33.140
Do you think you could try reading him
his rights any faster

15:33.223 --> 15:35.392
or with any less tonality, Detective?

15:37.603 --> 15:40.314
Tip it. Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.107
(chattering continues)

15:43.651 --> 15:45.152
-Your knee all right, Neal?
-Yeah.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.780
Uh, Miss Davenport.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.281
Good morning, gentlemen.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.160
Maxwell Jenkins,
late of St. Louis, Missouri.

15:53.535 --> 15:57.039
Mr. Jenkins is the prime suspect
in six unsolved robberies

15:57.122 --> 16:01.085
of welfare and social security checks
from senior citizens in the last month.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.672
He comes with many deluxe features,
including atrocious breath.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.966
-May I?
-Be warned, Miss Davenport.

16:07.466 --> 16:12.137
The part under "Peculiarities,
Deformities, Scars and Tattoos"

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
is very R-rated.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.649
Your lawyer, you lucky boy scout.

16:25.859 --> 16:27.820
We do have a welfare check suspect. Yes.

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
Bye.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.700
Hello, counselor.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.619
So you guys are at it again,
the old dollar collar.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.205
LaRue's and Washington's. It's yours?

16:38.288 --> 16:41.166
And may I say, if you care
for a little expert legal counsel,

16:41.250 --> 16:44.712
it's really the most blatant case of
entrapment I think I've ever encountered.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.714
Let me read between the lines a little.

16:47.506 --> 16:51.010
They trail him all over town, obviously,
because the tip they have on him

16:51.093 --> 16:53.971
is a thousand miles short
of probable cause to arrest.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.141
They completely lure him into something
he could never have considered

16:57.224 --> 16:59.059
if they hadn't mapped it all out for him.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.311
Then they don't even have
enough sense of justice

17:01.395 --> 17:03.147
to bury the money in a pocket
or someplace,

17:03.230 --> 17:07.776
so as not to attract some Good Samaritan
like, heaven forbid, you or me.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.405
Very persuasive, counselor, but I checked
with Detective Washington on this one.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.991
-The guy was walking away with the money.
-Allegedly.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.744
Oh, come on, Joyce.
You're talking legalese at me.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.164
Last month, three elderly women wound up
in County Emergency

17:20.247 --> 17:23.208
because of a guy who looked
a hell of a lot like Maxwell Jenkins.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.754
We all know the courts have approved decoy
arrests, even when they're dollar collars.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.630
I wouldn't care if it was a mink collar.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.174
The courts have never approved entrapment.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.594
Hey! You know as well as I do,
the guy's a real low-life.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.554
He may be. But that's not the issue.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.308
What is the issue, it seems to me, is that
your guys have to do a little better.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.811
See you in night court on this one.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.607
Oh, excuse me, Miss Davenport.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.318
Captain,
we've got six possible complainants

17:49.401 --> 17:50.861
we want to bring in for lineups.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.780
FURILLO: Any objections, counselor?

17:54.198 --> 17:55.574
Would you care to be present?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.702
I have to get back. I'm on Intake tonight.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.955
But be my guest. No objections at all.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.043
-Line 'em up, Neal.
-Right.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.753
Oh, just a second. How's your knee?

18:08.420 --> 18:10.672
Oh, I'll probably be better tomorrow.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.175
Just getting out of shape for those
40-yard sprints, is all, you know.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.760
That the one you hurt in college?

18:16.136 --> 18:18.222
Don't know what it is.
It'll be okay tomorrow.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.770
<i>-This is Sarah.</i>
-Hi, Sarah.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.855
-How's the calendar look tonight?
<i>-Oh, real light.</i>

18:26.939 --> 18:29.399
Light. Figures.
There's a football game on.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.818
The spread's three and a half.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.319
<i>-Personally involved?</i>
-No.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.197
But I used to date
the back-up quarterback for the Giants.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.699
<i>-Oh?</i>
-He had really wonderful legs,

18:37.783 --> 18:38.867
as I recall.

18:39.368 --> 18:42.037
Anyway, I still have a client
to interview.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.038
<i>-Oh?</i>
-Right.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.707
Just picked up a beaut of an entrapment.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.503
By the time it gets to court, it's going
to be a full-grown poisonous fruit.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.421
Tell you all about it later.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.258
Hey, Joycie.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.469
-Allan.
-I've been wanting to talk to you.

18:57.553 --> 19:01.223
It's a horrible place to meet,
but you look gorgeous.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.100
Really spectacular.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.853
Are you losing weight?
Because you-- you look thin.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.397
-Are you doing a little--
-What are you doing here, Allan?

19:08.480 --> 19:11.024
I thought you were making a killing
in medical malpractice.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.359
That's a nice pun.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.863
-Actually, I am. Wachtel and Gerber.
-(men arguing, yelling)

19:15.946 --> 19:19.241
That's why I thought maybe you could help
me out. Doing a favor for a guy.

19:19.950 --> 19:20.909
You see that mountain over there?

19:21.785 --> 19:25.164
Well, some lunatic with a penchant
for biting human flesh busted him.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.000
The guy's clean. Clean as a cucumber.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.794
-Then what do you need my help for?
-Ah.

19:31.712 --> 19:32.546
Well, um,

19:34.882 --> 19:36.258
frankly, I heard, uh--

19:36.508 --> 19:37.759
I mean, um-- (chuckles)

19:39.303 --> 19:41.096
Word is out about you and Frank.

19:42.306 --> 19:45.100
So, I thought, you know,
if I could tell you about the case,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.769
you could see what<i> garbage </i>it was

19:47.853 --> 19:49.730
and maybe have a few words with the man.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.775
Surely you have informal lines
of communication?

19:54.943 --> 19:55.777
(chuckles)

19:56.737 --> 19:58.447
"Informal lines of communication"?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.950
I mean, the fate of the world isn't always
decided in the living room, is it?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.412
-I'm genuinely disappointed in you, Allan.
-Ah.

20:05.787 --> 20:08.665
I remember you were one
of the brightest men in law school.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.085
You had fine sensibilities, ideals.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.421
Let's not get too holier-than-thou,
shall we?

20:14.504 --> 20:18.133
I mean, who would have thought you'd
wind up copping pleas for the indigent

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
and shtumming a cop.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.389
We all change, dear.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.517
Some of us change, Wachtel.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.645
Others of us mutate.

20:34.107 --> 20:35.150
Frank, we gotta talk.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.700
(sighs)

20:43.992 --> 20:46.370
I just came from Uncle Benny's Toyland,

20:46.453 --> 20:48.872
and I don't mind telling you
I'm more than a little upset.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.918
-About what?
-Your son has been shoplifting.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.837
Oh, Fay, all kids
go through phases like that.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.966
I remember when I was a kid,
I stole 15-cent Spauldings

20:59.049 --> 21:01.009
from Martinelli's Candy Store.
No big deal.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.095
Well, where I come from, mister,

21:03.178 --> 21:06.181
stealing a $40 computer game
is a plenty big deal.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.393
Well, what do you expect, Fay?

21:10.310 --> 21:12.771
Suddenly you're marrying a guy
Frank Jr. hardly knows,

21:12.854 --> 21:14.189
you yank him out of private school--

21:14.273 --> 21:15.190
With your blessing.

21:15.274 --> 21:18.110
All I'm saying is, that's a lot
for a seven-year-old kid to handle.

21:18.193 --> 21:19.820
I told you you were moving too fast.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.992
This is no time for I-told-you-so's.

21:25.075 --> 21:28.036
Now, you have got a very big problem here.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.664
What does that mean, "I've" got a problem?

21:34.334 --> 21:35.752
Well, I, um,

21:36.712 --> 21:37.754
I called Harvey.

21:38.588 --> 21:40.674
-Harvey.
-Yes, Harvey.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.553
He may be a nerd, Frank,

21:45.387 --> 21:47.055
but he's a first-rate psychologist.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.518
And he said that Frank Jr. shoplifted...

21:52.436 --> 21:54.938
because he wants to be caught
by his father, the cop,

21:55.856 --> 21:58.483
that his biggest problem right now
is his fear of losing you.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.695
-Losing me? That's ridiculous.
-Have you told him that?

22:02.362 --> 22:05.073
Well, n-not in so many words.

22:06.491 --> 22:08.035
In how many words, then?

22:08.660 --> 22:09.619
All right, I admit...

22:11.163 --> 22:12.748
maybe I've been avoiding the issue.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.461
Look, Fay, I may not have been going
around shoplifting,

22:17.544 --> 22:19.755
but that doesn't mean this has been easy
for me, either.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.342
I've been trying to work through
some fears of my own, you know.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.305
Fear of losing my son's love
to another man, for one thing.

22:29.222 --> 22:32.267
Not to mention a little--
a little jealousy.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.061
You're jealous?

22:35.020 --> 22:35.854
Of whom?

22:36.688 --> 22:38.648
We might not have had the best marriage
in the world, Fay,

22:38.732 --> 22:41.276
but that doesn't mean
I'm without strong feelings for you.

22:46.948 --> 22:50.911
(stammers)
I feel like I'm going to cry, Frank.

22:51.286 --> 22:52.120
Uh,

22:53.205 --> 22:56.083
tell Frank Jr. I'll pick him up
around 6:30.

22:56.750 --> 22:59.503
Just the two of us. We'll have
a man-to-man and work it out. Okay?

23:03.507 --> 23:04.424
Thank you, Frank.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.802
-Oh--
-(clears throat)

23:06.885 --> 23:08.053
Nothing to thank me for.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.056
I am the boy's father, after all.

23:11.973 --> 23:13.100
And you always will be.

23:28.990 --> 23:32.119
I want you to call this... 2-6-4--

23:32.702 --> 23:34.454
-Hi, Phil.
-Fay, how goes it?

23:34.538 --> 23:35.997
I'm fine. How are you?

23:36.289 --> 23:37.666
I'm glad you asked.

23:37.999 --> 23:42.003
Fay, may I divulge a little secret?

23:42.087 --> 23:43.338
-Hmm?
-Certainly.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.550
-It seems I'm gonna be a father.
-(gasps)

23:47.217 --> 23:49.094
-Really?
-Oh, Phil,

23:49.177 --> 23:51.179
I am so happy for you!

23:51.263 --> 23:55.475
-Way to go, tiger. So, who's the mother?
-Well, Grace, of course.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.853
-Oh.
-Why "oh"?

23:57.936 --> 24:00.605
Oh. Oh. Oh, nothing. Oh, no, it-it--

24:00.689 --> 24:03.191
I-- I'm sure Grace
is a very healthy woman, Phil.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.485
It's just that, well, statistically,

24:05.569 --> 24:09.281
there's a higher chance for birth defects
among women over 35.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.576
Maybe Grace should have an amniocentesis,
just to be on the safe side.

24:12.659 --> 24:13.952
Amniocentesis?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.579
Of course, on the up side,

24:15.662 --> 24:18.540
there are studies that indicate
that the offspring of older parents

24:18.623 --> 24:21.251
have a tendency towards
genius-level IQs.

24:22.377 --> 24:23.545
You and Grace could have another

24:23.628 --> 24:25.172
-Albert Schweitzer on your hands.
-No.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.089
Why not?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.884
Henry, what if I'm not smart enough
to talk to my own kid?

24:29.384 --> 24:32.762
What if he spends all his time at school
and in the library, ignoring me?

24:33.930 --> 24:36.183
I could wind up a lonely old man
sitting on a park bench,

24:36.266 --> 24:37.225
feeding the pigeons.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.145
Oh, Phil, I doubt that.

24:41.021 --> 24:43.106
Well, I won't put up with it,
I can assure you.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.859
I'll find a way to break through.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.116
Uh...

24:53.200 --> 24:55.494
(sirens wailing)

24:58.914 --> 24:59.956
MAN: This way, guys.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.293
-Guys, look out.
-(people chattering)

25:10.175 --> 25:13.386
All right, let us through here. Police.
Come on. Back up.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.764
(speaking Spanish)

25:16.973 --> 25:19.184
-MAN: Aren't you a little late?
-Move back. Stay back.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.771
-It was the green Cutlass, man.
-All right, just wait there.

25:23.396 --> 25:26.900
(speaking Spanish)

25:27.984 --> 25:29.694
-We've got to get her out of here.
-Help me.

25:31.655 --> 25:34.199
-Two boys and a girl, man.
-Do you know who they were?

25:34.282 --> 25:35.951
Yeah, the Vaqueros. I saw them.

25:36.034 --> 25:39.454
The shooters, man, the ones who tried
to shoot her brother, they shot her.

25:39.788 --> 25:41.373
-It was a '69 Cutlass.
-COFFEY: All right. All right.

25:41.456 --> 25:43.875
We gotta find the brother.
All right? Where's the brother?

25:43.959 --> 25:47.921
-(siren approaching)
-No. No. (speaking Spanish)

25:51.800 --> 25:55.136
Okay, give the ambulance
some room, please.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.056
(speaking Spanish)

25:58.139 --> 25:59.516
That's him! That's the brother!

25:59.599 --> 26:01.351
Hey, you, wait a minute.
I want to talk to you.

26:01.434 --> 26:02.978
Forget about it.
Man doesn't even speak English.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.187
-All right.
-BATES: Give the ambulance

26:04.271 --> 26:05.564
some room, please.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.691
It's no circus! Come on!

26:08.441 --> 26:11.361
-(gunfire)
-(screaming)

26:17.158 --> 26:20.245
-(explosions cease)
-(man speaking Spanish)

26:36.553 --> 26:38.013
-You got Los Angeles.
-They gonna play at home?

26:38.096 --> 26:41.266
You got 'em.
But you got 'em playin' here or there.

26:42.601 --> 26:43.935
-Boy, you--
-Okay--

26:44.019 --> 26:46.813
-How many points you give me?
-Houston 40 points over Chicago.

26:46.896 --> 26:49.566
-(Renko, Hill laugh)
-HILL: That's a good bet.

26:50.358 --> 26:51.484
You'd take that one too.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.279
Hey, Joe.

26:55.155 --> 26:57.449
Hey, Luce. Why the long face?

26:57.532 --> 26:59.409
Looks like your goldfish died
or something.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.119
Lighten up, will you, Renko.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.080
We just had a ten-year-old girl killed
by some creep.

27:05.832 --> 27:06.666
Sorry, Lucy.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.793
-Hey, Renko.
-RENKO: What?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.962
-Renko, I tell you what I'm gonna do.
-RENKO: What?

27:11.046 --> 27:13.256
I'm gonna take New York
minus the two and a half.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.509
-Yeah? Well, the spread is three points.
-Is that right?

27:16.593 --> 27:17.802
Well, why don't you use your head, Renko?

27:17.886 --> 27:21.765
When's the last time New York even come
close in a big game? About 1963?

27:21.848 --> 27:23.099
RENKO: I'll give you six--

27:23.183 --> 27:27.145
Astounding. A game
of absolute military purity.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.522
A game that even Clausewitz

27:29.606 --> 27:31.316
-might have admired...
-Yeah, and I'm the suckee.

27:31.399 --> 27:33.485
...and they haven't the slightest
interest in it,

27:33.568 --> 27:35.612
except to sully it with their gambling.

27:36.112 --> 27:39.407
Well, no one was laying odds
at Omaha Beach, gentlemen.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.493
Ballantine,

27:42.619 --> 27:46.081
(sighs) it's been the same
since the time of the Caesars.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.833
HILL: Hey, could we have some eggs?
What's happening?

27:49.584 --> 27:52.879
-How much is 14 percent of $1.85?
-WOMAN: Would you like your change, sir?

27:52.962 --> 27:53.797
Sir?

27:54.631 --> 27:55.465
(chuckles)

27:58.093 --> 28:01.221
The truth is, Napoleon would have been
a perfect NFL coach.

28:01.304 --> 28:04.307
Daring, imaginative,
and supremely self-confident--

28:07.394 --> 28:09.979
-(dog barking)
-Judas.

28:13.566 --> 28:16.820
I want to see a citation issued
to that individual.

28:18.613 --> 28:21.991
And while we're at it, let's check
that animal's rabies status.

28:22.450 --> 28:23.284
Judas.

28:24.244 --> 28:28.581
Henry, did we get any help
from Division Anticrime?

28:28.665 --> 28:30.917
Uh, three extra cabs

28:31.000 --> 28:34.295
on the east side, north of the park,
and the Von Steuben corridor.

28:34.629 --> 28:35.839
Everything is there, Henry.

28:37.173 --> 28:38.800
-Any word, Lieutenant?
-We should have preliminary forensics

28:38.883 --> 28:39.718
-in an hour.
-No. Come in.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.469
An APB is out on the Cutlass.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.888
That's the one thing
everybody seems to agree on.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.057
Green Cutlass, three occupants.

28:46.808 --> 28:47.726
Gang intervention?

28:48.184 --> 28:51.104
The main thing now, as they see it,
is to try to keep it isolated.

28:52.021 --> 28:53.565
-(speaking Spanish)
-WOMAN:<i> District Attorney's office.</i>

28:53.648 --> 28:55.567
-Assistant D.A. Costa.
<i>-Who's calling?</i>

28:55.650 --> 28:56.818
Captain Frank Furillo.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.904
-WOMAN:<i> I'm sorry. He's in court.</i>
-When does he get out of court?

28:59.988 --> 29:03.032
<i>-About an hour.</i>
-Okay, have him call me. Yeah. Thanks.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.536
Anybody run a computer check
on the brother?

29:06.619 --> 29:09.998
Yeah. Couple of juveniles,
grand larceny auto, assault.

29:10.623 --> 29:13.251
This could blow, Frank.
Pagans and Vaqueros.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.628
Both young,
both want to get on the boards.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.088
It's a jungle out there!

29:17.172 --> 29:18.965
-I know, but--
-What the hell's the sense?

29:19.048 --> 29:20.884
I mean, a ten-year-old girl.

29:22.135 --> 29:23.553
Perez. Easy.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.096
Yeah.

29:28.141 --> 29:30.101
Okay, my man, it's ten after 4:00.

29:30.185 --> 29:31.436
I suggest we take this baby

29:31.519 --> 29:33.021
-into the stable--
-Hey, look at that.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.314
-What?
-(tires screeching)

29:35.440 --> 29:37.233
Are you crazy? Get outta here.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.110
My guy, that's a no left turn...

29:39.194 --> 29:41.571
-Bobby, I just said it's 10 after 4:00.
-...4:00 to 6:00 p.m.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.572
Look at my watch.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.784
Oh, look, my watch has stopped.
We don't even know what time it is.

29:45.867 --> 29:49.162
-Hey, we haven't done anything all day.
-Bobby, this guy looks bad.

29:49.579 --> 29:52.081
-Hey, we're just giving him a ticket.
-Bobby, please?

29:52.165 --> 29:55.251
-No. No, we're gonna do it. Here we go.
-(siren wailing)

30:05.970 --> 30:08.640
I just hear it now:
"License and registration.

30:09.057 --> 30:10.809
License and registration, please."

30:15.980 --> 30:18.733
RENKO: Oh, no. Get on with it.
Get on with it. Get on with it.

30:21.736 --> 30:24.864
-License and registration.
-(speaking Spanish)

30:24.948 --> 30:26.241
(in English)
It's only two minutes to 4:00, man.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.284
You know,
you made an illegal left-hand turn.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.162
Oh, come on, man!
This really bites brown air!

30:31.246 --> 30:33.623
Let's just go! It's okay, there,<i> compad--</i>

30:33.706 --> 30:35.583
You don't have
your license and registration?

30:36.668 --> 30:38.711
-I left it in my other jacket.
-Oh, Lord.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.422
Step out of the vehicle, please. Let's go.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.176
-Come on.
-I got a game to go to tonight.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.177
(jingling)

30:48.096 --> 30:49.639
-Come on. Out of the car.
-What is that?

30:49.722 --> 30:52.100
-Come on. Up against the car.
-Hey, hey, slow up, pal.

30:52.892 --> 30:53.977
-Spread 'em!
-(coins jingle)

30:56.729 --> 30:59.732
(laughs) It's the prince
of the vending machine circuit.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.775
All right, pal.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.861
-What is wrong with you?
-Renko!

31:02.944 --> 31:04.362
-What is wrong with you coming out?
-Renko!

31:04.445 --> 31:06.197
Do you have any idea
what time of day it is right now?

31:06.281 --> 31:08.741
-Renko, Renko.
-You caught him. You skin him.

31:08.825 --> 31:10.618
You know what time it is? You know
what you just done to me?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.203
-You have any idea in this world...
-Let's go, goldfish.

31:12.287 --> 31:13.830
-...what you done to me?
-Let's go.

31:14.122 --> 31:17.333
You have no-- You can't even speak
the English language, can you?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.335
(thunder rumbling)

31:26.217 --> 31:29.095
You better hurry, Francis.
You're gonna be late for night court.

31:29.929 --> 31:32.682
Thanks, Phil.
I'll be out of here in ten minutes.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.901
Is everything all right, Phil?

31:44.652 --> 31:47.322
Well, in fact,

31:47.405 --> 31:50.617
uh, if you have a moment...

31:51.284 --> 31:52.118
Sure. Sit down.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.917
You know how some things are so important,
you never think about them?

31:59.834 --> 32:04.005
And suddenly they become a possibility,
so you think about 'em.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.674
Oh, yeah, I sure do.

32:12.096 --> 32:15.224
Well, for a while today,
I thought I was gonna be a father.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.103
Grace?

32:22.065 --> 32:24.317
I just got a phone call. False alarm.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.405
I wanted it. I really wanted it!

32:32.075 --> 32:32.909
I know, Phil.

32:34.243 --> 32:35.078
I'm sorry.

32:38.831 --> 32:42.210
Phillip Freemason Esterhaus Jr.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.463
(sighs)

32:48.716 --> 32:49.550
<i>C'est la vie.</i>

32:54.097 --> 32:54.931
Night court.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.336
Your Honor, my client informs me
that he was hungry.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.671
-Hungry.
-(whispers) Bobby!

33:27.255 --> 33:29.549
I understand, Miss Williams.

33:30.299 --> 33:31.134
But that was--

33:31.217 --> 33:33.803
Jane's brother-in-law
has a video tape recorder.

33:33.886 --> 33:37.223
I'm gonna pick that sucker up
and whisk it over to Jane's bedroom

33:37.306 --> 33:38.850
faster than grain through a goose.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.852
And then, Lord be with me,

33:41.144 --> 33:43.229
if nobody tells me the score of the game,

33:43.312 --> 33:44.480
-I got it--
-(gavel pounding)

33:44.564 --> 33:45.648
JUDGE SCHILLER: Gentlemen.

33:46.149 --> 33:47.025
What?

33:47.108 --> 33:48.484
Knock it off!

33:49.694 --> 33:51.320
Come on, George, give me a break.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.574
This alleged lowlife
is the scourge of the Hill.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.950
He's been preying on old people, you know.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.035
I understand all that.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.619
But you shouldn't have run those lineups,

33:58.703 --> 34:00.997
especially not with Mo Schiller
sitting in night court.

34:01.539 --> 34:05.877
Did Joyce happen to mention to you,
uh, Fruits of the Poisonous Tree?

34:06.502 --> 34:08.838
-Fruits of the--
-Poisonous Tree.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.092
A legal doctrine which holds
that if an arrest is illegal,

34:13.593 --> 34:17.138
certain evidence which police gather
as a result of that arrest is tainted

34:17.221 --> 34:18.431
and gets the toss.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.435
She consented to those lineups.
She walked right out the door.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.562
She let you put your foot into it.
That's all.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.607
One entrapment deserves another, Furillo.

34:27.690 --> 34:30.193
You don't just lose your dollar collar,
you lose 'em all.

34:30.860 --> 34:31.736
See you in court.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.239
That's why they call Schiller
"Let 'Em Go Mo," Frank.

34:36.240 --> 34:38.284
Please, George, get behind me on this one.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.788
I'm trying to keep the lid
on a cesspool up there.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.832
What the hell do you think
we're trying to do down here?

34:48.086 --> 34:48.920
(door opens)

34:59.180 --> 35:00.640
LARUE: I wonder what's going on
with that game?

35:00.723 --> 35:02.183
Don't talk about it. I'm having it taped.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.727
Twenty-six on the calendar, Stanley Felt.
Complaint by Detective Belker.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.356
BAILIFF: Your Honor, the defendant
has three outstanding warrants.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.777
-Mick--
-Come on. Move your leg, hairball.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.364
Allan Wachtel for defendant Felt.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.369
You think you can get maybe 30 days
on this dirtbag?

35:21.619 --> 35:24.705
Your Honor,
my client was the innocent victim

35:24.789 --> 35:29.085
of a brutal, animalistic assault
by arresting officer Belker...

35:29.168 --> 35:30.545
(growling)

35:33.256 --> 35:35.550
...and two uniformed patrol persons...

35:35.633 --> 35:37.552
(growling continues)

35:40.721 --> 35:44.058
-...one of them a very sadistic female.
-(growling continues)

35:46.310 --> 35:49.397
Would Detective Belker
kindly put a muzzle on.

35:52.316 --> 35:55.736
Allan, your man has seven cases.

35:56.904 --> 36:01.826
He's been a knee-buster for local sharks
for ten years. So who's kidding who?

36:05.037 --> 36:06.455
Will counsel approach?

36:10.459 --> 36:11.794
What'd the D.A. say, Captain?

36:13.671 --> 36:19.343
He said we have a fatal infestation
of fruits of the poisonous tree.

36:20.469 --> 36:21.387
What's that mean?

36:21.721 --> 36:23.848
Means we're gonna go
down the tubes on this one.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.309
I'll talk to the dude.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.395
-You may step back, gentlemen.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.149
JUDGE SCHILLER: You've been a rather
difficult man--

36:33.232 --> 36:35.860
-What'd ya get? Fifteen days, maybe?
-Forget about 15 days.

36:36.485 --> 36:40.114
He's sniffing "D" felony time
on various old manure,

36:40.323 --> 36:42.783
and it looks like he is gonna prefer
to tell tales on Snyder

36:42.867 --> 36:44.285
and the rest of those sharks.

36:44.368 --> 36:48.080
-Very good, Belker. We fell into a biggie.
-Thank you.

36:48.956 --> 36:50.166
That's correct, Your Honor.

36:51.000 --> 36:51.834
Next case.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.296
Twenty-seven on the calendar,
Maxwell Jenkins.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.923
Complaint by Detective Washington.

36:57.757 --> 36:58.591
We're on, lover.

37:00.009 --> 37:03.763
Who took it? It's gone.
I put it here five minutes ago.

37:03.846 --> 37:06.849
It's a $500 coat. I don't believe this!

37:06.933 --> 37:08.392
-(gavel banging)
-Did you take my coat?

37:08.476 --> 37:09.977
I don't believe this!

37:11.145 --> 37:13.356
Would counsel kindly take it outside?

37:13.814 --> 37:16.108
-Don't have a coat.
-JUDGE SCHILLER: Captain Furillo!

37:16.192 --> 37:17.610
Perhaps one of your men could--

37:17.693 --> 37:21.030
Take a 416 from Mr. Wachtel?
Certainly, Your Honor.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.865
Officer Grayson, would you, uh...

37:24.450 --> 37:27.328
(scoffs) You try to help these people out,
and look what happens.

37:27.411 --> 37:30.915
It's 100 percent cashmere--
All right. Got the point. Thanks.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.669
Mr. D.A., I'd like to talk with you
for a moment.

37:34.752 --> 37:37.713
JUDGE SCHILLER:
Mr. District Attorney, Miss Davenport.

37:40.007 --> 37:41.008
BAILIFF: Your Honor?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.345
(whispering)

37:46.722 --> 37:49.558
There will be a, uh, ten-minute recess.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.603
(spectators murmuring)

38:09.996 --> 38:11.455
<i>-</i>(TV announcer chattering)
-Detective Washington.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.165
I'd like to see the D.A. about my case.

38:13.249 --> 38:15.209
You're gonna have to wait a minute.
It's not the right time.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.669
The spread's three and a half.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.005
What's he doing kicking a field goal?

38:19.088 --> 38:21.757
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Danelo just has a chip shot, 32 yards.</i>

38:22.008 --> 38:24.343
<i>He's 11 of 13 from inside the 30.</i>

38:25.177 --> 38:27.138
Come on, guys, go for it.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.391
Are you crazy? It's only second down.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.810
-Forget it. I changed my mind.
-I don't believe this.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.770
Touchdown. Touchdown.

38:34.854 --> 38:35.855
Don't forget, Miss Davenport,

38:35.938 --> 38:38.316
if the Giants kick a field goal,
you owe us a lunch.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.778
(shouting, laughing)

38:42.862 --> 38:45.281
DAVENPORT:
Giants, you really disappoint me.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.749
You know, Luce, there's always an upside.

38:55.499 --> 38:56.334
Yeah? What?

38:57.043 --> 38:58.419
We drew double shift, right?

38:59.086 --> 39:02.340
-How can you joke at a time like this?
-How can you not joke?

39:03.132 --> 39:03.966
Yeah.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.178
-Hey, why don't you drive for a while?
-No.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.597
-Come on, my back hurts.
-No!

39:10.222 --> 39:12.266
(indistinct chatter)

39:22.860 --> 39:23.694
(gavel bangs)

39:24.362 --> 39:25.780
Will the parties step up?

39:27.281 --> 39:28.407
You too, officers.

39:35.206 --> 39:38.501
Off the record, gentlemen,
I wanted to be sure you understand

39:38.584 --> 39:42.254
the reasons why I'm constrained
to let Mr. Jenkins go.

39:43.047 --> 39:44.673
-Do you?
-No, Your Honor.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.468
Uh, Neal, the judge's position

39:47.551 --> 39:50.513
is that you singled out Jenkins
and lured him into criminality.

39:51.013 --> 39:53.849
Without that entrapment, we wouldn't have
the lineup identifications,

39:53.933 --> 39:56.185
so the evidence is tainted
and can't be used.

39:56.852 --> 40:01.190
Therefore, the judge has to set low bail
because our cases are very weak.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.274
Is that an accurate paraphrase,

40:02.358 --> 40:03.484
-Your Honor?
-Absolutely.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.862
The rest is garbage, my friends.

40:07.154 --> 40:10.032
But what about<i> The People v. Fernandez,</i>
Your Honor?

40:10.825 --> 40:13.285
In what law school
did you graduate, Detective?

40:14.286 --> 40:16.247
Have you any idea the difference

40:16.330 --> 40:19.041
between a<i> People v. Fernandez </i>random decoy

40:19.125 --> 40:23.129
and a<i> People v. Robles</i>
premeditated entrapment?

40:23.212 --> 40:26.465
Judge, if you let him walk out of here,
you know he's gonna skip.

40:26.715 --> 40:29.969
Well, yes, the Court has some expectation

40:30.052 --> 40:33.806
that the defendant may make use...

40:34.682 --> 40:38.144
of this nation's highly-developed system

40:38.227 --> 40:40.938
of intercity bus transport.

40:41.981 --> 40:46.026
May the Court give Detective Washington
some advice?

40:46.444 --> 40:49.155
You bring me something I can live with,

40:50.489 --> 40:52.241
and I'll throw away the key.

40:53.367 --> 40:54.869
The parties may step back.

41:04.920 --> 41:09.091
Your Honor, our application is for release
of defendant on his own recognizance.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.886
Denied. $5,000 bond.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.679
A cash alternative, Your Honor?

41:14.096 --> 41:16.474
Of course. $25 cash bail.

41:17.349 --> 41:18.851
-(gavel bangs)
-JUDGE SCHILLING: Next case.

41:18.934 --> 41:21.187
Your Honor, sir, can I ask you something?

41:21.270 --> 41:22.438
What is that, Jenkins?

41:22.521 --> 41:24.940
No disrespect intended to the court,
Your Honor,

41:25.024 --> 41:27.318
but I heard that you heard
what the football score was,

41:27.401 --> 41:29.737
and since it's a matter
of some personal interest,

41:29.820 --> 41:31.739
I wonder if you could see your way clear--

41:31.822 --> 41:34.617
-Of course. It was--
-No!

41:35.618 --> 41:36.660
Yes!

41:36.952 --> 41:40.289
It was Giants 16, Washington 13.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.750
Danelo kicked a sudden death field goal.

41:43.334 --> 41:44.710
(man whispers) That's great.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.129
Give me my money, Renko.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.383
He has ruined my personal existence.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.942
You know, Captain, I work my butt off
all the time out there.

42:08.567 --> 42:09.902
What the hell good is it, huh?

42:10.611 --> 42:13.697
They love it when we screw up. Saves 'em
having to work their own butts off.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.699
Let's face realities, Neal.
It could be a lot worse.

42:15.783 --> 42:17.284
Worse? Worse?

42:17.368 --> 42:19.870
The guy walked, Captain. He's out there.

42:20.287 --> 42:23.374
-Yeah, but he won't be walking the Hill.
-So he'll be walking Midtown.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.335
If he doesn't leave town,
he'll be caught again.

42:26.418 --> 42:28.128
Yeah. And again, and again, and again.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.508
I'm not a virgin, Neal. Neither are you.

42:33.551 --> 42:34.468
We screwed up.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.138
You screwed up the arrest.
It was a leaky boat going in.

42:39.139 --> 42:39.974
Yeah.

42:41.058 --> 42:41.892
How's your knee?

42:43.852 --> 42:45.020
You afraid, Neal?

42:52.027 --> 42:54.405
They could retire me,
couldn't they, Captain?

42:55.573 --> 42:56.657
If it got bad enough.

42:57.741 --> 42:59.535
Maybe even if it wasn't so bad.

43:01.870 --> 43:02.705
Yeah.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.668
Some joker in a white coat
had two too many margaritas for lunch,

43:08.419 --> 43:10.045
looked at the X-rays a little funny.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.674
Football, gone.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.427
This gone.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.222
Next stop,
selling shoes or driving a taxi.

43:20.639 --> 43:22.433
It could all happen, couldn't it, Captain?

43:24.518 --> 43:25.686
Over my dead body.

43:27.313 --> 43:28.147
Hmm?

43:29.064 --> 43:31.108
They'll retire you over my dead body.

43:34.194 --> 43:36.488
(laughing)

43:49.043 --> 43:50.294
Green Cutlass.

43:51.378 --> 43:54.632
BATES: This is 2203. Request assist
in pursuit of suspect.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.093
DISPATCHER:<i> Roger, 2203. 10-4.</i>

44:06.602 --> 44:09.355
Freeze! Keep 'em up!

44:11.523 --> 44:13.317
-Hold it!
-COFFEY: Get 'em up!

44:14.735 --> 44:15.569
Get 'em up.

44:16.445 --> 44:17.279
Hold it!

44:29.541 --> 44:30.376
Hold it!

44:32.294 --> 44:33.420
Don't do it!

44:40.719 --> 44:41.720
Luce!

45:11.625 --> 45:12.459
A kid.

45:18.215 --> 45:19.049
Come on.

45:42.322 --> 45:43.490
(police radio chatter)

45:49.830 --> 45:51.415
Everything looks clean, Lucy.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.125
They've arrested the girl.

45:53.208 --> 45:55.294
We've got the gun, plus two slugs
out of the wall,

45:55.377 --> 45:57.004
and a confession from the other kid.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.048
IAD's been notified,
but that's just a formality.

46:00.132 --> 46:02.134
You'll have to come in
off the streets for a week.

46:04.887 --> 46:05.846
Are you okay?

46:06.221 --> 46:08.849
-Yes. Fine.
-CALLETANO: Frank.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.852
Frank, can I see you a minute, please?

46:15.564 --> 46:17.107
It was good work, Lucy.

46:29.870 --> 46:31.038
How are you doing, really?

46:34.374 --> 46:36.210
I am doing okay, really.

46:38.128 --> 46:40.255
I'm fine. Yeah.

46:41.256 --> 46:42.382
The kid shot at me.

46:43.383 --> 46:44.218
I know he did.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.311
You want anything from the unit?

46:56.522 --> 46:58.190
I'm gonna get some Lifesavers.

47:59.918 --> 48:00.752
What was it?

48:04.715 --> 48:07.843
A 14-year-old kid
who shot a ten-year-old girl.

48:11.763 --> 48:12.598
(sighs)

48:15.976 --> 48:17.019
What do you want to do?

48:19.062 --> 48:20.063
Come to my place?

48:30.741 --> 48:31.909
I really need you.

48:43.837 --> 48:46.840
(closing theme playing)
