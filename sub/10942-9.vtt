WEBVTT

00:02.451 --> 00:05.351
This is an eviction notice.

00:06.287 --> 00:07.454
What?!

00:07.521 --> 00:08.654
Said something to your mom,
didn't you?

00:08.722 --> 00:12.225
I invited Chase
to the party tonight.

00:12.293 --> 00:13.226
You did?

00:14.295 --> 00:15.528
I'm Ashley's husband,

00:15.596 --> 00:17.464
and if you choose to evict us,

00:17.531 --> 00:19.299
I'm gonna move Ashley
so far from Hudson

00:19.366 --> 00:22.301
the only time you'll ever
see her is on Facebook.

00:22.368 --> 00:23.402
What's this?

00:23.470 --> 00:25.070
Open it up.

00:25.671 --> 00:29.141
Tonight you will receive
the perfect kiss.

00:29.209 --> 00:30.142
I gotta go tell her.

00:30.210 --> 00:31.910
Amy, don't.

00:32.212 --> 00:34.879
Amy! There's just something
that I need to tell you.

00:38.584 --> 00:39.850
Come on! Yah! Yah!

00:43.589 --> 00:46.390
Don't even think about it!

00:46.458 --> 00:47.325
Dad!

00:47.392 --> 00:48.392
Hey, no.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.440 --> 01:05.742
Come on, McBride,
let's get these calves loaded.

01:05.809 --> 01:07.611
Hurry up. Come on.

01:16.153 --> 01:17.553
Damn calf!

01:17.621 --> 01:19.288
What are you doin'?

01:20.290 --> 01:22.525
I'm on it.
Naw, look, forget about it.

01:22.592 --> 01:24.493
You're gonna let $600 bucks
just run into the woods?

01:24.561 --> 01:25.926
We know where it's going.

01:25.994 --> 01:28.029
We can pick it up
when we move the cows out.

01:28.096 --> 01:29.230
Come on.

01:51.553 --> 01:53.320
You know, it's gonna be so weird,

01:53.388 --> 01:56.790
you going to school
and me staying home.

01:57.857 --> 01:58.991
Lou's coming back.

01:59.059 --> 02:01.160
You guys'll spend
some time together.

02:01.228 --> 02:02.828
Yeah, I know,
but it's September.

02:02.896 --> 02:04.430
Amy... I mean, usually I'm the one

02:04.498 --> 02:05.531
getting ready to go to school.

02:05.599 --> 02:07.400
No, Amy, listen.

02:08.467 --> 02:09.669
You hear that?

02:09.735 --> 02:12.572
Yeah, and he doesn't
sound happy.

02:24.983 --> 02:27.785
Boy, these days,
between you and Lisa,

02:27.853 --> 02:29.420
I've been doing
a lot of back and forth

02:29.487 --> 02:30.954
to the airport.

02:31.022 --> 02:33.290
I told you I could take a cab,
grampa.

02:33.358 --> 02:35.426
All I'm saying is...

02:36.528 --> 02:38.762
Well, you're turning into
quite the world traveller.

02:38.830 --> 02:40.063
A non-stop flight
to Houston,

02:40.131 --> 02:41.798
a hop, skip and a jump
and here I am.

02:41.866 --> 02:43.300
It's more like a commute.

02:43.368 --> 02:45.668
Well, whatever you call it,

02:46.604 --> 02:48.271
I'm always happy to see you.

02:48.339 --> 02:49.672
Thank you.

02:52.042 --> 02:55.945
But, you know,
everybody's gonna be asking...

02:56.012 --> 02:58.114
Why I'm back so soon.

02:58.181 --> 03:01.117
Yeah, something like that.

03:01.184 --> 03:02.718
This is my home.

03:02.785 --> 03:06.087
Do I really need a reason
to wt t to be with my family?

03:06.155 --> 03:07.456
I don't think so.

03:07.523 --> 03:08.590
Neither do I.

03:11.894 --> 03:14.195
This is really heavy.
Can you take it?

03:16.599 --> 03:17.931
Oh, careful.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.066
Ungh!

03:29.043 --> 03:30.544
Ty, look.

03:31.713 --> 03:34.314
Oh, must have got separated
from his mother.

03:34.415 --> 03:36.115
Poor guy. He's stuck.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.551
What's with the rope?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.153
I don't see any brand.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.589
No tags.

03:42.657 --> 03:44.123
Aw... hey, bud.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.493
Well, somebody's gonna
want him back.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.794
Take it easy, buddy.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.995
Lou?

03:50.062 --> 03:53.031
Ah, hey, hey!
Welcome back, honey.

03:53.099 --> 03:55.133
Hi, dad.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.402
Wow! You must be racking up
the frequent flyer miles, huh?

03:56.469 --> 03:57.369
What's the occasion?

03:57.437 --> 03:59.871
Crisis in the middle east?

04:00.807 --> 04:02.874
Maybe.
Just a theory.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.443
You know, Mallory,
if you want to help out,

04:04.511 --> 04:06.411
why don't you give me a hand
with my luggage?

04:06.478 --> 04:08.112
Listen, I appreciate
everyone's interest

04:08.180 --> 04:09.447
in my travel plans,

04:09.515 --> 04:11.048
I really do,

04:11.116 --> 04:12.750
but I'm not in the mood
for a big q-and-a right now.

04:12.818 --> 04:14.419
What I am in the mood for
is a hot shower,

04:14.486 --> 04:16.487
so, if you'll excuse me.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.154
Okay.

04:18.223 --> 04:20.358
Don't worry about
your luggage, I'm all over it!

04:22.259 --> 04:23.627
You might need a forklift.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.830
All right.

04:26.897 --> 04:27.564
Okay, just bring
him back a little.

04:27.632 --> 04:28.532
Give me some slack.

04:28.599 --> 04:29.766
All right, there we go.

04:32.203 --> 04:33.403
Okay, all good.

04:33.471 --> 04:34.904
Easy, guy...
There you go.

04:34.972 --> 04:36.239
All right.

04:36.307 --> 04:37.006
No, wait! Come here!

04:37.074 --> 04:38.073
Ty!

04:38.141 --> 04:39.608
Hey, come back here!

04:39.676 --> 04:41.043
Ty!

04:41.110 --> 04:42.345
Hey!

04:42.412 --> 04:43.979
Get him! Get him!

04:44.047 --> 04:46.615
Grab his rope!

04:47.551 --> 04:49.117
Come here, buddy!

04:49.185 --> 04:50.753
Hey, come on back!

04:51.888 --> 04:54.121
Don't jump on it!
Just grab it!

04:55.458 --> 04:56.825
- Get him!
- I'm gonna get him!

04:58.327 --> 05:00.762
You okay?
Come on!

05:03.599 --> 05:05.233
Whoa.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.836
Oh, poor thing.
He must be looking for his mom.

05:07.903 --> 05:09.770
Yeah.

05:09.838 --> 05:10.804
Well, look at that.

05:12.640 --> 05:13.907
Hey, check out the brand.

05:16.978 --> 05:18.979
Ty, it looks like
my dad's brand.

06:03.789 --> 06:04.822
Someone sent me
an airplane ticket.

06:04.890 --> 06:07.057
It's probably
some Internet scam.

06:07.125 --> 06:08.058
Where's it to?

06:08.126 --> 06:10.294
Uh, Abbotsford, Tuesday.

06:10.361 --> 06:12.362
Why would anyone send you
an airplane ticket

06:12.431 --> 06:14.731
to Abbotsford of all places?

06:14.799 --> 06:16.198
It's gotta be a mistake.

06:16.266 --> 06:18.034
Uh, maybe not.

06:18.101 --> 06:21.938
Chase is gonna be there
giving a clinic.

06:22.005 --> 06:24.808
Calgary to Abbotsford Tuesday,

06:24.875 --> 06:28.077
Abbotsford to Calgary
Wednesday?

06:28.145 --> 06:29.812
I mean, he said
he wanted me to come,

06:29.879 --> 06:30.846
but school's starting.

06:30.914 --> 06:32.414
I didn't take him seriously.

06:32.482 --> 06:35.717
Uh, an airplane ticket
is pretty serious.

06:35.785 --> 06:38.119
No boy ever sent me one.

06:40.156 --> 06:43.024
I didn't figure I'd be seeing
you two till suppertime.

06:43.092 --> 06:44.560
Yeah, well, something came up.

06:44.627 --> 06:46.327
Whose calf is that?

06:46.394 --> 06:48.395
I think it's yours, dad.

06:48.464 --> 06:49.497
Take a look.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.433
That's my brand.

06:52.501 --> 06:55.302
Yeah, I think we may
have found your stolen cows.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.839
You kidding me?
Let me...

06:58.874 --> 07:00.441
That's my brand.

07:00.509 --> 07:01.541
Yeah.

07:02.910 --> 07:04.945
Well, where a t they?

07:05.079 --> 07:07.013
So we drove in off the
highway about ten minutes to here,

07:07.081 --> 07:08.314
and then we parked the trucks

07:08.382 --> 07:09.883
at the end of this road
right here.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.818
That's not exactly
prime cattle country.

07:11.886 --> 07:15.021
And we found the calf
somewhere in this area here.

07:15.089 --> 07:16.222
And I think he's an orphan,

07:16.290 --> 07:17.623
'cause we couldn't find his mom

07:17.691 --> 07:19.959
and that's why we brought him
back here.

07:20.026 --> 07:22.194
That's arrowhead ridge.

07:22.261 --> 07:23.562
As far as I know,

07:23.630 --> 07:24.864
nobody's been leasing
that land for years.

07:24.931 --> 07:26.198
Well, they are now.

07:26.265 --> 07:27.933
Well, that doesn't
make much sense.

07:28.001 --> 07:29.401
Yeah, why would someone
steal cattle

07:29.469 --> 07:30.970
and then just keep them
for two years?

07:31.037 --> 07:32.070
What's in it for them?

07:32.138 --> 07:33.638
Ah, well,
it's next to impossible

07:33.706 --> 07:36.040
to put branded cattle
on the market,

07:36.108 --> 07:38.676
especially if
it's not your brand.

07:38.744 --> 07:40.077
The calves -
they don't have a brand...

07:40.145 --> 07:43.214
they're easy to sell,
there's no questions asked.

07:43.281 --> 07:44.816
Well, I'm done
with the questions.

07:44.884 --> 07:47.084
Where are you going?
Just hold up there!

07:47.152 --> 07:48.620
Hey, Mallory, whatever happened

07:48.687 --> 07:51.254
to helping me with my luggage?

07:52.924 --> 07:54.725
Did I miss something?

07:57.896 --> 07:59.396
What the hell do you
think you're gonna do?

07:59.463 --> 08:00.697
I'm going to get my cows!

08:00.765 --> 08:02.799
When are you gonna get it
through your head?

08:02.867 --> 08:05.068
Someone steals your cattle,
you go to the police.

08:05.136 --> 08:08.137
Oh, 'cause they did such
a good job last time.

08:08.204 --> 08:09.505
Come on, Jack,
if they were your cows,

08:09.573 --> 08:10.540
what would you do?

08:10.607 --> 08:11.974
You know damn well what I'd do

08:12.042 --> 08:13.876
and you're gonna do it too.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.714
Okay.

08:18.782 --> 08:21.216
Okay, I'll go fill out
some paperwork.

08:21.284 --> 08:22.350
Good.

08:27.723 --> 08:28.790
I don't need a babysitter.

08:28.858 --> 08:30.491
You start mouthin' off
to the cops

08:30.560 --> 08:32.693
you'll need more
than a babysitter.

08:32.760 --> 08:33.827
Let's go.

08:35.229 --> 08:37.297
Forget it, no way.

08:51.679 --> 08:52.745
Hi, Ashley.

08:56.316 --> 08:57.383
Ashley?

09:01.055 --> 09:03.689
I know you've been avoiding me.

09:04.624 --> 09:06.391
Look, the...

09:06.459 --> 09:08.026
The eviction notice
was a terrible mistake,

09:08.094 --> 09:09.895
one I deeply regret.

09:10.830 --> 09:15.901
Honey, the last thing I want
is for you to ever move away.

09:15.969 --> 09:18.770
So what do you want, mom?
'Cause I'm kinda busy.

09:18.838 --> 09:20.537
I want to put things right.

09:20.606 --> 09:21.839
I'm your mom.

09:21.907 --> 09:23.207
I don't even want
to be your landlord.

09:23.274 --> 09:25.175
Are you saying
you want us to move?

09:25.243 --> 09:26.310
No!

09:27.245 --> 09:28.312
No, I...

09:29.982 --> 09:31.515
We've just got to stop fighting

09:31.583 --> 09:33.684
about where you live
and how you live.

09:33.752 --> 09:36.252
And who I live with!

09:37.187 --> 09:39.623
The lot your trailer is on,

09:39.690 --> 09:42.626
I want to give it to you.

09:42.693 --> 09:44.094
Are you serious?

09:44.161 --> 09:46.062
Yes, absolutely.

09:47.665 --> 09:50.233
Wow!
I can't believe that!

09:50.300 --> 09:51.634
Wait till I tell Caleb!

09:51.701 --> 09:53.502
No, no, now...

09:53.569 --> 09:55.470
See, that's the thing.

09:56.439 --> 09:58.273
This is a gift for you alone

09:58.341 --> 09:59.441
and your marriage
complicates it

09:59.509 --> 10:01.744
just a little.

10:01.811 --> 10:04.013
So you want me
to get a divorce?

10:04.080 --> 10:05.213
I knew it.

10:05.281 --> 10:07.149
No, Ashley,
exactly the opposite.

10:07.216 --> 10:09.383
You just have to sign
a marriage contract.

10:09.451 --> 10:10.985
Like a pre-nup?

10:11.053 --> 10:12.486
Yeah, yeah.

10:13.188 --> 10:15.189
Except you went ahead
and got married without one.

10:18.827 --> 10:21.729
But we can fix that now, too.

10:27.201 --> 10:29.335
You know, I was really glad
to hear you were coming home.

10:29.403 --> 10:32.706
Yeah, it was...
Kind of last minute.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.708
Last minute, huh?

10:34.776 --> 10:36.609
You sure brought
a lot of luggage.

10:36.678 --> 10:39.312
How long are you staying for?

10:39.380 --> 10:41.213
See this?
Peter got it for me

10:41.281 --> 10:43.949
at this amazing
floating boutique hotel

10:44.017 --> 10:45.951
on our second...

10:46.019 --> 10:47.853
No, maybe it was our third,
honeymoon.

10:49.122 --> 10:51.724
Well, it's really, really nice.

10:51.792 --> 10:53.258
You can have it.

10:53.326 --> 10:54.827
You serious?

10:54.895 --> 10:57.562
Yeah, it's not like I'll be
wearing it around here.

10:57.629 --> 11:00.131
What happens if you and Peter
go on your fourth or fifth

11:00.199 --> 11:02.701
or maybe sixth honeymoon,
and he says,

11:02.768 --> 11:04.135
"remember that cute little dress
I got you?

11:04.203 --> 11:05.369
Why don't you wear that one?"

11:05.437 --> 11:08.506
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

11:08.574 --> 11:12.209
But I really don't want
to talk about it.

11:12.276 --> 11:14.311
You don't want
to talk about what?

11:14.378 --> 11:16.180
Nothing.

11:16.247 --> 11:17.948
Oh, I get it.

11:18.016 --> 11:19.583
"Nothing" doesn't really mean
nothing.

11:19.650 --> 11:21.785
It just means nothing
that involves me.

11:21.853 --> 11:23.520
Well, I've been getting that
a lot lately.

11:23.588 --> 11:25.856
Here's your luggage, Lou!

11:28.658 --> 11:30.993
She's been a little touchy
lately.

11:31.061 --> 11:32.361
Her parents are on tour

11:32.429 --> 11:34.430
and she's going back
to school on Tuesday

11:34.497 --> 11:36.833
and something happened
with her and Badger,

11:36.900 --> 11:38.667
but she doesn't want
to talk about it.

11:38.736 --> 11:42.071
Ah, well,
I know exactly how she feels.

11:44.607 --> 11:46.208
You see?
That's the way to go.

11:46.275 --> 11:47.442
You make a police report,

11:47.509 --> 11:49.010
you set the whole thing
in motion.

11:49.078 --> 11:49.677
Yeah, okay, you don't
have to say it again.

11:49.746 --> 11:50.645
You were right.

11:50.713 --> 11:52.380
Mr. Fleming?

11:52.448 --> 11:53.648
Yeah.

11:53.716 --> 11:54.916
I just checked the database.

11:54.984 --> 11:56.284
I had trouble locating
your report.

11:56.352 --> 11:58.086
Do you remember the date
that you filed it?

11:58.154 --> 11:59.621
Well, how the hell
should I know?

11:59.688 --> 12:00.955
That was over two years ago.

12:01.022 --> 12:02.356
I was in the hospital!

12:02.423 --> 12:04.424
Okay, the two year thing
might be a problem.

12:04.492 --> 12:05.659
Uh, look, we're gonna have
to either get you

12:05.727 --> 12:07.128
to file a new report

12:07.195 --> 12:08.295
or I gotta send someone down
to the archives to...

12:08.363 --> 12:10.330
You do know this
isn't about forms, right?

12:10.398 --> 12:11.298
It's about cattle!

12:11.366 --> 12:13.033
Of course he knows.

12:13.101 --> 12:14.268
And I understand
your frustration,

12:14.335 --> 12:15.769
Mr. Fleming, I do,

12:15.836 --> 12:17.303
there's just a process
that has to be adhered to.

12:17.371 --> 12:21.174
Oh, you think the rustlers
are following the same process?

12:21.242 --> 12:24.878
Okay, there's the information
you need to re-file.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.846
What language is this?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.148
That's the u-r-l
for the Alberta livestock

12:28.215 --> 12:29.348
identification website.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.549
Just go online,

12:30.617 --> 12:31.817
you download a PDF
of the missing

12:31.885 --> 12:32.985
or reported stolen
cattle report,

12:33.052 --> 12:34.552
just fill out the particulars

12:34.620 --> 12:36.021
and you can fax it back
to that toll free number,

12:36.089 --> 12:37.656
and then someone from
the livestock investigation unit

12:37.723 --> 12:38.757
will get back to you.

12:38.825 --> 12:40.725
Website?! PDF?!

12:41.694 --> 12:43.328
Jack-
U-r-l-m-n-o-p?!

12:43.396 --> 12:44.930
What the hell is this?!

12:44.998 --> 12:47.565
No! That's their job!
We're not doin' all their work!

12:47.633 --> 12:50.734
Hey, do we tell you to come
and muck out our barn?!

12:50.803 --> 12:52.069
What happened
"to serve and protect"?

12:52.137 --> 12:53.437
What happened to getting
off your ass...

12:53.505 --> 12:54.972
I'll be in the truck!

12:55.040 --> 12:56.540
And doing some actual police work?!

13:11.856 --> 13:12.956
Shut up.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.566
She's giving you the land?

13:19.833 --> 13:20.800
Two and a half acres...

13:20.818 --> 13:22.051
You could build
a real house on that.

13:22.119 --> 13:23.386
Yeah, but you know my mom...

13:23.453 --> 13:25.622
There's always a catch.

13:25.689 --> 13:28.591
She wants us to sign
a marriage contract.

13:28.659 --> 13:30.693
Is that really such a big deal?

13:30.761 --> 13:31.961
I mean, I know you love Caleb

13:32.029 --> 13:33.663
and you want to share
everything with him,

13:33.731 --> 13:35.498
but you never know,
maybe one day

13:35.565 --> 13:37.733
you're gonna want something
to call your own.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.267
You sound just like my mom.

13:39.335 --> 13:42.270
She's giving you the chance
to be independent, ash.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.873
I mean, what happens
if Caleb gets hurt again?

13:44.941 --> 13:46.341
Or, you know, he got sued

13:46.409 --> 13:48.376
'cause his horse kicked
someone in the head?

13:48.444 --> 13:50.178
He's a rodeo cowboy.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.279
Oh, and Chase Powers
is like what?

13:52.347 --> 13:54.181
An investment banker?

13:54.249 --> 13:55.149
Where did that come from?

13:55.216 --> 13:56.517
I'm just saying

13:56.585 --> 13:57.919
that you're being
all sensible and mature,

13:57.986 --> 14:00.220
when the same girl is willing
to drop everything,

14:00.288 --> 14:01.789
and I mean everything,

14:01.857 --> 14:03.724
as soon as her boyfriend
gives her an airplane ticket.

14:03.792 --> 14:04.992
It's only frosh week

14:05.060 --> 14:07.661
and I wouldn't even be
missing any classes.

14:07.728 --> 14:10.730
Plus, I haven't even
made up my mind yet.

14:10.798 --> 14:13.600
Sounds to me like you have.

14:17.705 --> 14:19.940
Well, I'll tell ya, he was...

14:20.007 --> 14:21.708
He was this
close to getting arrested

14:21.776 --> 14:24.043
for assaulting
a police officer!

14:24.110 --> 14:25.510
I would have paid
to have seen that!

14:25.579 --> 14:27.312
I confess, words were spoken,

14:27.380 --> 14:29.347
but it never went further
than that.

14:29.415 --> 14:31.016
Yeah, that's 'cause I had
to haul your butt outta there

14:31.084 --> 14:32.084
before they put you in jail.

14:33.653 --> 14:35.454
You guys!

14:35.521 --> 14:36.755
It's good to be back.

14:36.823 --> 14:39.357
And it's great
to have you back, Lou,

14:39.425 --> 14:41.593
but no one's buying it.

14:41.660 --> 14:43.628
Um, I'm sorry?
Buying what?

14:43.696 --> 14:44.963
The whole happy-to-be-back act.

14:45.030 --> 14:46.464
And it's not just me...

14:46.531 --> 14:47.998
Everyone wants to know
what's really going on!

14:48.066 --> 14:49.133
Mallory.

14:51.836 --> 14:53.137
Oh sure.

14:53.205 --> 14:54.171
Like you don't want to know
the real story...

14:54.239 --> 14:56.673
Why Lou's here and Peter isn't?

14:58.410 --> 15:01.044
Well, the question's
crossed my mind.

15:01.113 --> 15:02.479
Oh?

15:02.546 --> 15:06.216
Well, dad, have you asked grampa
where Lisa is?

15:06.283 --> 15:08.585
Is she in France? Again?

15:08.652 --> 15:11.154
Or dad, um, I don't see Janice
at the table.

15:11.222 --> 15:12.622
What are you doing here?

15:12.689 --> 15:15.024
Or Amy, are we gonna have
to ask where Ty is

15:15.092 --> 15:16.459
for the next four years

15:16.527 --> 15:18.127
while he's at school
in Calgary?

15:18.194 --> 15:19.861
Okay, Lou, we get it.

15:19.929 --> 15:23.665
Look, all I'm saying is,
where does it say that a coupe

15:23.733 --> 15:26.301
has to be by each other's side
every minute?

15:26.369 --> 15:28.670
Like, who says that
just 'cause you get married,

15:28.738 --> 15:29.938
suddenly you're joined
at the hip?

15:30.006 --> 15:32.107
Like where is this law
written down

15:32.175 --> 15:34.342
that says two people,
who just happen to be married,

15:34.409 --> 15:36.810
can't live their own lives?!

15:41.082 --> 15:42.750
Well, I gotta say I sure missed
your cooking, Lou.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.084
How about
a little garlic toast?

15:44.153 --> 15:46.254
Yeah, the food looks great.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.488
Perfect.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.194
You know, Ty,
this is fascinating.

15:54.262 --> 15:58.031
This anatomy and physiology
of farm animals.

15:58.098 --> 15:59.232
Yeah, well, for a real thrill,

15:59.300 --> 16:01.334
check this out.

16:01.402 --> 16:03.870
Principles of chemistry.

16:03.937 --> 16:04.971
Mm-hmm.

16:05.039 --> 16:07.439
Complete with illustrations.

16:08.841 --> 16:11.377
You know...

16:11.444 --> 16:13.679
It's sort of true
what Lou was saying.

16:13.746 --> 16:15.013
Almost all the couples we know

16:15.081 --> 16:18.050
are living separate lives.

16:18.117 --> 16:20.919
Well, except Caleb and Ashley.

16:20.987 --> 16:22.853
And you and me.

16:22.921 --> 16:24.722
Unless you're planning on
going somewhere?

16:24.790 --> 16:26.991
You're the one
who's going somewhere!

16:27.059 --> 16:28.493
I mean...

16:28.561 --> 16:32.063
Chatting with your classmates
about bio-molecules

16:32.130 --> 16:33.731
and nucleic acids and...

16:36.968 --> 16:41.371
By the time I get home,
I'll be sick of talking.

16:41.439 --> 16:44.841
Who was it that said
that talking was overrated?

16:44.909 --> 16:47.344
Was that you?
I think it was.

16:56.687 --> 16:58.020
Look, I'm not saying

16:58.088 --> 16:59.922
you haven't done a great job
up till now,

16:59.989 --> 17:01.357
but summer's over,

17:01.425 --> 17:03.058
and you're gonna be
starting university, so...

17:03.126 --> 17:05.894
Exactly.
Summer's over, so bookings are way down.

17:05.962 --> 17:07.230
I mean, even with classes,

17:07.297 --> 17:08.664
I can manage a half-empty
dude ranch.

17:08.732 --> 17:10.565
I don't know, Soraya,
that's a lot to handle.

17:10.633 --> 17:11.866
You didn't come all the way
from Dubai

17:11.934 --> 17:13.300
to give me
a performance review.

17:13.368 --> 17:14.435
Obviously not.

17:16.672 --> 17:19.741
I just needed to be home,
that's all.

17:19.808 --> 17:22.344
Just like Peter needs
to be in Dubai.

17:22.411 --> 17:25.146
So... you think you can
have your own life

17:25.214 --> 17:27.281
and be married
at the same time?

17:28.383 --> 17:30.150
Well, um...

17:32.320 --> 17:34.288
It took me and Peter awhile
to figure it out,

17:34.356 --> 17:37.124
but, yeah.

17:37.191 --> 17:39.126
It's a balancing act.

17:39.193 --> 17:40.561
You know, I'm in the middle

17:40.629 --> 17:42.328
of a this long distance
thing too,

17:42.396 --> 17:45.865
but I'm having trouble
figuring out the rules.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.133
There are no rules,

17:47.200 --> 17:48.768
except get a good
cell phone plan.

17:48.835 --> 17:50.102
And besides that,

17:50.170 --> 17:51.304
you just figure it out
as you go along.

17:51.372 --> 17:52.538
Well, that's what I was doing

17:52.606 --> 17:55.408
until Chase sends me
an airline ticket.

17:55.476 --> 17:56.676
He wants me to go
to Abbotsford,

17:56.744 --> 17:59.544
but the timing is just
really bad and...

17:59.612 --> 18:00.845
I don't know if I'm ready.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.048
Chase Powers?
Like Amy's Chase?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.987
Uh, I guess they did
a clinic together.

18:09.054 --> 18:10.889
Right, um...
You know,

18:10.956 --> 18:13.392
Amy never mentioned
anything about this.

18:13.459 --> 18:15.760
I didn't know you guys
were an item.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.728
Yeah, we don't really
talk about it.

18:17.796 --> 18:21.399
I get the feeling
she has an issue with him.

18:21.466 --> 18:22.866
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that, Soraya,

18:22.934 --> 18:24.735
but one thing I do know

18:24.803 --> 18:27.305
is that when you're ready
to go away with a guy,

18:27.372 --> 18:29.407
you're not gonna need
to ask anybody.

18:29.474 --> 18:31.474
You'll just know.

18:33.644 --> 18:36.145
I'm not an idiot.
I know this marriage contract

18:36.213 --> 18:38.682
is about more than
a couple acres of land.

18:38.749 --> 18:40.817
So, how much do we owe you, ash?

18:40.884 --> 18:42.352
It's just so that my mom
can make sure

18:42.420 --> 18:45.355
that Caleb doesn't ever touch
a cent of the Stanton money.

18:45.423 --> 18:46.722
Ashley, I'm sure,
in her own way,

18:46.790 --> 18:48.223
your mom's just trying
to protect you.

18:48.291 --> 18:49.491
That's what Soraya said,

18:49.559 --> 18:50.759
but, I mean,
what does she know?

18:50.827 --> 18:52.428
She's supposed to be
starting university,

18:52.495 --> 18:56.699
but instead she's flying off
to see Chase at some clinic.

18:56.766 --> 18:58.567
Chase.

18:59.235 --> 19:00.569
You know, maybe the
person you should be talking to

19:00.637 --> 19:03.638
is not me or Soraya,
maybe it's Caleb.

19:03.706 --> 19:05.673
Just tell him
and see what he says.

19:05.741 --> 19:07.908
Yeah, great idea, Amy.

19:07.976 --> 19:09.210
I'll tell my husband

19:09.277 --> 19:10.911
that my mom thinks
he's just after our money;

19:10.979 --> 19:13.514
that'll be fun.

19:37.404 --> 19:38.771
Oh my gosh!

19:45.812 --> 19:48.614
Poor thing...
Nobody loves you.

19:48.682 --> 19:50.015
I feel your pain.

19:50.083 --> 19:53.084
But maybe this milk
will make you shut up.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.619
All right?

19:54.687 --> 19:56.988
Little cow,
I've got something for you.

19:57.055 --> 19:59.758
Your mom's milk -
two percent.

19:59.825 --> 20:00.925
Cow!

20:04.563 --> 20:06.264
Come here, cow!

20:06.331 --> 20:07.664
Two percent!
Come on!

20:08.600 --> 20:10.501
Stupid cow, come here!

20:13.805 --> 20:14.872
Slow down!

20:16.441 --> 20:18.675
You can't just drink the milk.

20:18.743 --> 20:20.511
Come on, drink the milk.

20:22.313 --> 20:24.113
You stupid cow!

20:27.418 --> 20:28.751
You okay?

20:29.920 --> 20:31.921
What are you doin', Mallory?

20:31.988 --> 20:33.756
I just thought
if I gave the calf some milk

20:33.824 --> 20:35.725
it would shut up,
but obviously not.

20:35.793 --> 20:37.760
Well, now,
don't take it personally,

20:37.828 --> 20:39.761
but he's not lookin' for milk;

20:39.829 --> 20:42.063
he's lookin' for his mama.

20:42.131 --> 20:44.466
You're just not who he wants
to see right now.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.968
Yeah, him and everyone else.

20:47.036 --> 20:49.671
Come on, Mallory,
it's not like that.

20:49.739 --> 20:50.839
Oh yeah?

20:50.907 --> 20:52.707
Jamie, Jake and badger.

20:52.775 --> 20:54.642
None of them are even
friends with me anymore!

20:54.709 --> 20:56.076
Even Amy and Lou ignore me.

20:56.144 --> 20:57.511
But what do I expect?

20:57.579 --> 20:58.813
It's not like I'm really
a part of the family

20:58.880 --> 21:00.581
or even my own family,

21:00.649 --> 21:02.450
what with
the never-ending tour!

21:02.517 --> 21:04.552
It sucks to be me!

21:05.487 --> 21:09.356
Well, I'm here if you
want to talk about it.

21:09.424 --> 21:11.424
Jack, I just did!

21:14.361 --> 21:15.428
Good.

21:21.234 --> 21:23.235
Hey! Hey, Murphy!
You got a minute?

21:23.303 --> 21:24.938
Mr. Fleming,
what can I do for you?

21:25.005 --> 21:27.138
Well, I got the form
off the computer thing

21:27.206 --> 21:28.507
and I filled it out

21:28.575 --> 21:30.241
and I left the old man
at home this time.

21:30.309 --> 21:32.010
That's good.

21:32.078 --> 21:33.512
Uh, listen, I'm kind of late
for a court appearance.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.080
Why don't you just leave
the paperwork at the front desk

21:35.147 --> 21:37.082
and, uh, just wait for
a livestock investigator

21:37.149 --> 21:39.184
to get back to you, all right?

21:39.251 --> 21:40.586
Livestock investigator.

21:40.653 --> 21:42.153
Well, how long's
that gonna take?

21:42.221 --> 21:43.287
I'm sure they'll
get right on it.

21:44.656 --> 21:47.257
Well, it's two-year-old
cold case.

21:47.325 --> 21:50.995
I'm sure it's gonna be
a top priority!

21:56.635 --> 21:58.168
Hey, where's that map?

21:58.236 --> 22:00.371
I need you to show me
exactly where my cows are.

22:00.438 --> 22:02.473
What's going on?

22:02.540 --> 22:03.640
I just got off the phone

22:03.708 --> 22:05.542
with the livestock
investigation guy.

22:05.610 --> 22:07.611
Guess what he's doing?
Nothin'!

22:07.678 --> 22:09.246
So guess what I'm gonna do?

22:09.314 --> 22:10.947
Uh, somethin' stupid.

22:11.016 --> 22:12.316
You should talk.

22:12.384 --> 22:14.151
No, I'm gonna go get my cows,

22:14.219 --> 22:15.918
'cause they can't arrest me
for that, Jack.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.753
Besides, they've got more
important things to do,

22:17.821 --> 22:19.422
like go over my paperwork.

22:19.490 --> 22:21.424
Okay, but dad, how're you gonna
get your cattle from here

22:21.492 --> 22:22.791
all the way to here
by yourself?

22:22.859 --> 22:24.927
I have friends,
I have neighbours.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.396
What about us?

22:26.463 --> 22:27.296
Well, yeah, that
makes more sense.

22:27.364 --> 22:28.398
We know where the herd is;

22:28.465 --> 22:29.565
we can just take you
right there.

22:29.633 --> 22:30.833
I don't want you two
mixed up in this.

22:30.901 --> 22:31.833
I'll go.

22:31.901 --> 22:33.235
Grampa, that's not fair.

22:33.302 --> 22:36.238
Well, someone has to ride
shotgun for your father.

22:36.305 --> 22:37.906
Please, don't do me
any favours.

22:37.973 --> 22:39.841
Guys, we could just ride cross
country from here to here.

22:39.909 --> 22:40.975
Straight from there, yeah.

22:41.044 --> 22:42.411
You kids aren't goin' anywhere!

22:42.478 --> 22:43.845
Oh, kids!
Suddenly we're kids?!

22:49.217 --> 22:50.284
Oh, shut up!

22:52.854 --> 22:56.390
I did not travel 7,000 miles
to listen to this.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.359
Now, get the horses;

22:58.427 --> 23:00.461
we're all going.

23:00.529 --> 23:01.995
Where are we all going?

23:02.064 --> 23:03.196
- Nowhere.
- Nowhere.

23:03.264 --> 23:04.730
Seriously, Mallory.

23:04.798 --> 23:06.433
Oh, come on!

23:06.500 --> 23:09.235
Somebody has to stay
here and hold down the fort.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.700
Hold down the fort, Mallory.

23:33.275 --> 23:34.741
You're too young.

23:35.777 --> 23:38.112
What would your parents think?

23:40.549 --> 23:43.050
I'm sick of this crap.

24:05.871 --> 24:09.208
Hard to believe they've
been sittin' here all along.

24:09.275 --> 24:11.310
Yeah, makes a man
feel kind of foolish.

24:11.377 --> 24:13.112
Come on, dad, you got 'em back.

24:13.179 --> 24:14.413
Be happy.

24:14.481 --> 24:15.647
I'll tell you
what I'll be happy about.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.082
I'll be happy
when I see that cop's face

24:17.150 --> 24:19.383
when I tell him what he can do
with all that paperwork!

24:20.719 --> 24:23.421
Okay, let's round 'em up
and get 'em home!

24:24.490 --> 24:25.590
Come!

24:25.657 --> 24:26.924
- Ho!
- Come on! Come on!

24:27.859 --> 24:30.428
- Yah!
- Come on!

24:33.365 --> 24:34.931
Come on, cow.

24:34.999 --> 24:37.667
Get up!

24:39.370 --> 24:40.970
Come on, cow!

24:41.038 --> 24:42.038
Hup!

24:48.312 --> 24:49.412
I can do that, ash.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.079
It's okay.

24:51.148 --> 24:53.449
I really don't mind.

24:53.517 --> 24:55.884
I'm almost finished.

24:56.819 --> 24:58.354
Is there something bugging you?

24:58.421 --> 24:59.955
Just forget about it.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.358
Come on, ash, what's wrong?

25:03.293 --> 25:04.360
Nothing.

25:08.464 --> 25:09.531
I didn't want to tell you,

25:09.598 --> 25:11.599
but my mom wants
to give me the lot

25:11.667 --> 25:13.401
that this trailer is on.

25:13.469 --> 25:16.971
Really? Sounds good.

25:17.039 --> 25:19.274
You think that sounds good?

25:19.341 --> 25:21.776
My friends think
it sounds good,

25:21.843 --> 25:23.343
but it isn't!

25:23.411 --> 25:26.613
Because my mom doesn't want
your name on the deed!

25:26.681 --> 25:28.615
Fair enough.

25:28.683 --> 25:30.350
What?

25:30.418 --> 25:32.219
I guess I just don't
see the problem.

25:32.287 --> 25:35.789
The problem is my mom wants us
to sign a marriage contract

25:35.856 --> 25:37.558
so that she can cut you
out of the deal!

25:37.625 --> 25:38.957
Well, if she wants
to give you a gift,

25:39.025 --> 25:41.060
I'm not gonna stand
in the way of that.

25:41.127 --> 25:42.195
Call her up.

25:42.262 --> 25:43.896
You don't understand, Caleb.

25:43.963 --> 25:45.698
It's not just this deal.

25:45.765 --> 25:47.866
It's any money
I'm ever gonna get...

25:47.934 --> 25:49.802
my inheritance, anything.

25:50.737 --> 25:51.870
Ashley...

25:54.740 --> 25:55.674
I did not ask you to marry me

25:55.741 --> 25:57.942
for your family fortune.

25:58.010 --> 26:02.180
I asked you to marry me
because I love you.

26:02.248 --> 26:04.048
I love you too.

26:14.125 --> 26:15.192
Hup!

26:23.268 --> 26:24.801
Did you see that?

26:24.869 --> 26:26.236
All I see is cows, Jack.

26:26.303 --> 26:29.505
It's a wonderful sight,
because they are my cows.

26:29.573 --> 26:31.841
Would you just be quiet?
Hold up here.

26:31.908 --> 26:34.009
Hey, hold up, hold up, hold up!

26:40.618 --> 26:41.817
Someone's comin'.

26:42.985 --> 26:45.220
I knew this was a bad idea.

26:46.556 --> 26:47.489
Ah.

26:50.059 --> 26:51.593
Change of plans!

26:51.661 --> 26:52.794
Get these cows outta here.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.496
Take 'em up through the trees!

26:54.564 --> 26:55.797
Why? What's wrong?

26:55.865 --> 26:57.132
Nothin' so far.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.166
We want to make sure
it stays that way.

26:58.234 --> 26:59.933
There's a truck comin'.

27:00.001 --> 27:01.235
Your grampa and I'll...

27:01.303 --> 27:02.303
Well, we'll head back.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.371
I'll come with you guys.

27:03.438 --> 27:04.739
No, no, you stay with the cows.

27:04.806 --> 27:06.274
No, I'm not much
good with cattle.

27:06.341 --> 27:07.808
I'll come with you guys
and help if it turns into a...

27:07.876 --> 27:10.043
Into a what?

27:10.111 --> 27:11.445
A discussion.

27:11.513 --> 27:13.614
Can you two handle this?

27:13.682 --> 27:14.748
Yeah, it'll be fine.

27:15.683 --> 27:16.616
All right.

27:16.684 --> 27:18.318
Don't lose them!

27:18.386 --> 27:20.119
Yah!

27:21.689 --> 27:23.222
Hup! Come on!
Let's go!

27:24.725 --> 27:25.725
Hup! Come on!
Come on!

27:27.595 --> 27:28.662
Come on up!

27:41.308 --> 27:42.641
- All right.
- Okay.

27:45.779 --> 27:48.813
Hey, boy, easy, easy.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.615
Step up, step up.

28:01.794 --> 28:03.794
Come on, guys, let's go!

28:05.930 --> 28:08.164
Okay!

28:09.834 --> 28:13.136
Forget the damn ropes.
Let's go!

28:13.204 --> 28:14.270
Come on, Ty!

28:16.441 --> 28:17.507
Go!

28:35.491 --> 28:36.624
Give me those.

28:39.395 --> 28:40.928
What the hell?!

28:42.030 --> 28:44.031
Well, it wasn't here before.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.734
What do you think?
Beavers?

28:45.801 --> 28:48.536
Yeah, beavers...
With ropes.

28:52.106 --> 28:54.908
Give me a hand!

28:54.976 --> 28:56.810
That's the same guy
that shot me!

28:58.446 --> 28:59.513
Get the chain.

29:01.983 --> 29:03.584
Don't do anything stupid,

29:03.651 --> 29:06.652
and that includes everything
you're thinkin' right now.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.987
Well, we gotta do somethin'.

29:08.054 --> 29:10.189
Just hold your horses!

29:10.257 --> 29:11.290
By the time they move
that tree,

29:11.358 --> 29:12.992
the girls will be long gone.

29:13.059 --> 29:14.360
Yeah, thanks for the input, Ty,

29:14.428 --> 29:16.028
I really appreciate it,
but what if they're not?

29:16.096 --> 29:17.162
Enough, enough!

29:19.165 --> 29:20.299
What the hell are you doin'?!

29:20.367 --> 29:21.834
I'm gonna fire
a couple of warning shots

29:21.902 --> 29:23.234
and scare 'em off!

29:23.302 --> 29:25.003
Except if they've got guns too,
you idiot.

29:25.070 --> 29:26.137
Shhh! Look.

29:30.376 --> 29:31.777
Just great.

29:35.481 --> 29:36.347
We gotta get outta here.

29:37.617 --> 29:38.716
Jeez!

29:38.784 --> 29:39.884
Hey!

29:39.951 --> 29:40.951
Holy crap!

29:42.186 --> 29:43.687
Was that what I think it was?

29:43.755 --> 29:45.122
Yeah, let's go.

29:49.628 --> 29:50.694
That's how you do it.

29:52.263 --> 29:53.831
Get down!

29:59.970 --> 30:01.538
Get on your feet!

30:01.605 --> 30:02.672
Get up!

30:03.607 --> 30:05.174
Get your hands up.

30:06.877 --> 30:08.611
Oh, hell, it's you.

30:08.679 --> 30:09.846
You're the guy that...

30:09.914 --> 30:11.179
Yeah, I'm the guy.

30:11.247 --> 30:13.715
I'm the guy you shot.
Now it's payback time.

30:13.783 --> 30:15.484
This is a bad idea.

30:15.552 --> 30:16.785
Which shoulder
do you want it in?

30:16.853 --> 30:18.420
Hey, hey,
listen to the old guy.

30:18.488 --> 30:20.388
All right?
This is a bad idea.

30:20.457 --> 30:22.123
Oh really?
You got a better one?

30:22.191 --> 30:24.526
Yeah, actually, I do.

30:34.158 --> 30:35.224
Come on!

30:38.262 --> 30:40.096
Hey, come on!

30:40.164 --> 30:42.765
You can't just leave us
like this!

30:42.833 --> 30:44.434
Yeah? Watch us.

30:44.501 --> 30:45.701
We don't have
any food or water!

30:45.769 --> 30:46.902
Oh, you're breakin' my heart.

30:46.971 --> 30:48.104
We could die out here!

30:48.172 --> 30:49.471
We could die out here.

30:49.538 --> 30:51.673
Yeah, that's what we're hopin'.

30:51.740 --> 30:55.543
You bastards!
This isn't over!

31:05.620 --> 31:06.820
Lou.

31:06.888 --> 31:07.654
What's wrong?

31:07.722 --> 31:08.489
Someone's coming.

31:13.561 --> 31:16.130
Grandpa, dad, thank God.

31:18.933 --> 31:20.534
We heard a shot.

31:20.602 --> 31:22.235
Yeah, well, your dad's
got an itchy trigger finger.

31:22.303 --> 31:24.004
What were you shooting at?

31:24.071 --> 31:26.272
Oh, it's a long story.

31:26.340 --> 31:27.407
Where the hell are my cows?

31:40.320 --> 31:43.422
Come on, Caleb,
we're gonna be late.

31:43.490 --> 31:45.024
It's just I really
can't figure out

31:45.091 --> 31:46.691
how to tie this stupid thing.

31:46.759 --> 31:48.360
Here.

31:48.428 --> 31:49.995
Let me do it.

31:50.063 --> 31:52.697
I don't get it.
Why the jacket and the tie?

31:52.765 --> 31:54.265
Well, because we're gonna go
meet the lawyer

31:54.333 --> 31:56.167
about our future and...

31:57.102 --> 31:58.669
I guess I just don't want
anybody to think

31:58.737 --> 32:00.204
that I don't take this
seriously.

32:00.272 --> 32:01.372
Aw.

32:01.440 --> 32:03.941
Well, you look very handsome.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.143
Yes, I do.

32:05.210 --> 32:07.978
If I wasn't a happily
married woman...

32:08.047 --> 32:10.113
Which you are, aren't you?

32:10.181 --> 32:11.581
Yes, I am.

32:13.684 --> 32:14.817
You know, I've got this problem

32:14.885 --> 32:16.420
and I was wondering
who to call,

32:16.487 --> 32:17.820
Call Soraya.

32:17.888 --> 32:19.189
She's got all the answers.

32:19.257 --> 32:22.359
So, uh, you know,
here's my situation:

32:23.294 --> 32:24.627
I bought this girl
an airline ticket...

32:24.695 --> 32:25.928
and not just any girl;

32:25.995 --> 32:27.096
this girl I really have
a thing for...

32:27.164 --> 32:30.433
and she didn't even write
or call me back.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.435
So, what's the deal?
Did she lose my number?

32:32.502 --> 32:33.735
Is she too busy to call?

32:33.803 --> 32:35.471
Does she not even
miss me or what?

32:35.539 --> 32:39.075
Obviously I miss you.
It's just, you know...

32:39.142 --> 32:40.642
No, baby, I don't know.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.043
How am I supposed to know
when you don't get back to me?

32:44.380 --> 32:46.047
I'm dying to see you,
and I know it's selfish,

32:46.115 --> 32:48.749
but I'm only asking for
a couple of days of your time.

32:48.817 --> 32:49.917
Yeah, you're right,

32:49.985 --> 32:51.286
it's just a couple of days...

32:51.353 --> 32:53.421
I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

32:53.489 --> 32:54.556
Hey, Soraya?

33:00.661 --> 33:02.162
Sorry, didn't mean
to interrupt.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.765
Oh, no, I was just um...
Talking to a friend.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.000
Uh, what can I get for you,
Ms. Stanton?

33:07.068 --> 33:08.635
Just coffee to go.

33:08.703 --> 33:10.504
I've got an appointment.
I'm running a little late.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.573
Okay, well, I've got
a fresh pot right here.

33:12.640 --> 33:13.872
So, I guess you'll be

33:13.940 --> 33:15.741
heading off to university soon.

33:15.809 --> 33:18.043
Yeah, that was
the shortest summer ever.

33:18.112 --> 33:20.213
I'll bet.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.815
Well, I wish Ashley was
a little more like you...

33:22.882 --> 33:24.217
going off to school,

33:24.284 --> 33:25.951
using a job at a diner
as a stepping stone

33:26.019 --> 33:27.886
instead of a dead end
lifestyle choice.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.722
Oh.
You go ahead and answer that.

33:30.789 --> 33:32.591
I've got to run anyway.

33:32.658 --> 33:34.459
Just don't let some cowboy
turn your head around

33:34.527 --> 33:37.329
and jeopardize your future.

33:39.465 --> 33:41.600
It's not exactly later, Chase.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.301
I can't help it.

33:43.369 --> 33:45.936
Every minute away from you
feels like an eternity to me.

33:46.004 --> 33:47.404
That's sweet.

33:47.472 --> 33:48.972
Um...

33:49.541 --> 33:53.344
And it was very sweet of you
to buy me that ticket,

33:53.411 --> 33:54.978
but, um...

33:56.781 --> 33:57.948
I can't go.

33:58.016 --> 33:59.483
You can't.

33:59.551 --> 34:02.051
No, um,
it's my first week of school

34:02.119 --> 34:03.953
and I really don't want
to miss it.

34:04.021 --> 34:05.622
Okay, yeah. No, it's cool
you don't want to miss school.

34:05.689 --> 34:07.890
I get it.
But, um...

34:07.958 --> 34:10.592
No, I won't take it personally.
I'll see you when I get back.

34:10.661 --> 34:11.827
Yeah.

34:11.895 --> 34:12.594
All right, I'll see ya.

34:12.663 --> 34:13.728
Okay. Bye.

34:55.670 --> 34:56.735
Jack?

34:59.640 --> 35:00.707
Amy?

35:11.618 --> 35:12.685
Guys?

35:15.188 --> 35:16.255
Hello?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.426
Guys?

35:41.512 --> 35:42.646
Help!

35:42.714 --> 35:43.947
Shut up and open the door!

35:44.014 --> 35:47.251
Let go of me!
Help!

35:47.318 --> 35:49.286
Open the damn door!

35:51.088 --> 35:52.889
We're gathered to sign
a marriage contract

35:52.957 --> 35:56.359
between Ashley Elizabeth Stanton
and Caleb Evans Odell

35:56.426 --> 35:59.462
specifying separation
of property

35:59.529 --> 36:02.064
in order to facilitate
the transfer of ownership

36:02.132 --> 36:06.101
of lot 197 from Val Stanton
to her daughter,

36:06.169 --> 36:09.337
and pursuant to this objective
I have prepared a deed

36:09.405 --> 36:11.673
and the requisite paperwork.

36:11.741 --> 36:14.676
However, my e-mail request
for a copy

36:14.744 --> 36:17.445
of the certificate of marriage
from the state of Montana

36:17.513 --> 36:18.913
has turned up a slight glitch

36:18.981 --> 36:20.882
in that Roland Wallace
Emmerich's licence

36:20.949 --> 36:24.352
to act as justice of the peace
for Beaverhead county

36:24.420 --> 36:27.554
expired on the 17th of September
last year.

36:27.622 --> 36:29.022
Okay...

36:29.090 --> 36:32.526
Call me stupid,
but what are you saying?

36:32.594 --> 36:34.528
Mr. Emmerich is
the justice of the peace

36:34.596 --> 36:36.897
who married you two
in December of last year.

36:36.964 --> 36:38.699
So, you understand that
since his licence

36:38.767 --> 36:40.534
had already expired,

36:40.602 --> 36:42.868
there's no need to sign
a marriage contract,

36:42.936 --> 36:45.905
because you're not
legally married.

36:53.113 --> 36:54.246
I can't believe this!

36:54.315 --> 36:55.080
This could be a blessing
in disguise.

36:55.148 --> 36:56.081
You set this up!

36:56.149 --> 36:57.549
Ashley!

36:57.617 --> 36:59.117
I did not, I swear.
I'm as surprised as you.

36:59.185 --> 37:00.919
Oh, you are not surprised!
You are thrilled!

37:00.986 --> 37:02.153
Ashley, this could be
a good thing.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.555
Can't you see that?
Val!

37:03.623 --> 37:04.689
Do you know what, mom?
It could be a good thing!

37:04.756 --> 37:05.889
Ashley, come on!

37:05.957 --> 37:06.890
'Cause now you can give me
the property

37:06.958 --> 37:08.559
without any strings!
You wish!

37:15.967 --> 37:17.034
What the hell?

37:21.905 --> 37:23.540
- Hup! Ya!
- Come on.

37:25.108 --> 37:26.810
Keep going.

37:32.182 --> 37:33.950
Yep.

37:35.886 --> 37:37.586
Mr. Fleming?

37:37.654 --> 37:38.821
What are you doing?

37:38.888 --> 37:40.288
What's it look like, Murphy?

37:40.357 --> 37:41.923
I'm doing what
you should be doing - your job!

37:41.991 --> 37:43.492
Yeah, well, it's my
job to write you a ticket

37:43.560 --> 37:46.127
for contravening
municipal bylaw 5.1.

37:46.195 --> 37:47.830
And you better believe
I'm gonna write you a ticket

37:47.897 --> 37:49.665
for the disposal
of all this animal waste.

37:49.733 --> 37:50.866
Ha!

37:50.933 --> 37:52.133
Oh, you're gonna arrest me,
huh?

37:52.201 --> 37:54.101
For going and getting
my stolen cows back?

37:54.169 --> 37:55.603
Why don't you look
at their brand?

37:55.671 --> 37:56.937
Yeah! Yeah, right!

37:57.005 --> 37:58.172
Oh, and while you're at it,

37:58.240 --> 37:59.407
the two guys who tried
to kill me

37:59.475 --> 38:00.575
are in a livestock trailer

38:00.642 --> 38:03.544
on a logging road
up on arrowhead ridge!

38:05.881 --> 38:06.947
You're welcome.

38:42.948 --> 38:45.316
Police!
We've got you surrounded!

38:45.384 --> 38:48.520
If anyone's inside,
show yourself now!

39:21.679 --> 39:24.448
Thank you, officer, we can take it from here.

39:28.252 --> 39:31.054
Excuse me, I'm starving.

39:35.759 --> 39:37.560
I think we're out of that
cheese spread, Jack.

39:37.627 --> 39:39.762
Next time you're in town,
you may want to pick some up.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.564
I'll add it to the list.

39:41.631 --> 39:42.998
But right now...

39:43.066 --> 39:44.600
We're gonna have a little talk.

39:44.668 --> 39:48.170
How about a rain check
on the chat, Jack?

39:48.238 --> 39:50.472
I've had a really bad day.

39:52.174 --> 39:54.108
You're having a bad day?

39:54.176 --> 39:56.143
One of the guys that
you let out of that truck

39:56.211 --> 39:58.045
shot me two years ago!

39:58.113 --> 39:59.414
He was on his way to jail

39:59.482 --> 40:01.282
and now he's on
the freedom train

40:01.350 --> 40:02.584
to God knows where!

40:02.651 --> 40:03.718
'Kay, just...

40:05.953 --> 40:07.388
Fine.

40:07.455 --> 40:09.122
What Tim...

40:09.190 --> 40:12.292
What Tim is trying to say
is that, like me,

40:12.360 --> 40:13.494
he wants to make sure

40:13.561 --> 40:15.696
you understand
how lucky you are

40:15.764 --> 40:18.665
that nothing terrible
happened to you.

40:18.733 --> 40:20.000
I understand.

40:20.067 --> 40:21.768
Well, then why the hell
did you do

40:21.835 --> 40:23.969
exactly what I told you
not to do?!

40:24.037 --> 40:26.205
Okay, I know I screwed up,

40:26.273 --> 40:27.774
but maybe if you would've
just let me come

40:27.841 --> 40:28.841
in the first place,

40:28.909 --> 40:30.042
none of this would've happened!

40:30.110 --> 40:31.110
Seriously, Jack,

40:31.177 --> 40:33.679
you say I'm a part
of the family

40:33.747 --> 40:36.749
except when it really counts.

40:40.486 --> 40:44.556
Please, can you just promise
not to tell my parents?

40:44.624 --> 40:46.525
That's a promise
I will not make.

40:57.268 --> 40:58.268
It's your first day
of university.

40:58.336 --> 41:00.103
I got you something.

41:00.171 --> 41:01.572
Did ya?

41:07.779 --> 41:08.846
Oh, wow.

41:11.982 --> 41:15.485
This is amazing.

41:15.553 --> 41:16.719
Thank you.

41:16.787 --> 41:18.588
You're welcome.

41:18.656 --> 41:19.923
But you do know I still
have a couple of years

41:19.990 --> 41:22.024
before I can even apply
to vet school, right?

41:22.092 --> 41:24.894
I know.
Even then I might not get in.

41:24.962 --> 41:26.695
Yes, you will.

41:28.598 --> 41:30.732
Go on, try 'em out.

41:34.938 --> 41:36.004
Can you hear anything?

41:36.072 --> 41:37.272
No, I can't hear that.

41:42.811 --> 41:44.211
How about now?

41:48.984 --> 41:50.785
Loud and clear.

41:55.056 --> 41:57.958
All right,
you better get going.

41:58.025 --> 41:59.192
Thank you.

41:59.259 --> 42:02.696
You're welcome.
Have a good day.

42:02.763 --> 42:03.864
See ya.
See ya.

43:01.618 --> 43:04.119
Well, you're not most girls.

43:05.055 --> 43:07.023
But look, Soraya,
I'm kind of new to this

43:07.090 --> 43:09.224
and I don't want to blow it.

43:09.292 --> 43:11.293
I'm pretty new
to this too, Chase,

43:11.361 --> 43:13.062
and, honestly,

43:13.129 --> 43:15.031
I'm just not ready to fly off

43:15.098 --> 43:17.266

43:17.333 --> 43:18.767
A guy.

I was kind of hopin'

43:20.002 --> 43:21.736
I was more than a guy to you
by now.

43:21.804 --> 43:23.638
Come on, you know
that's not what I meant.

43:23.706 --> 43:26.775
What do you mean then, Soraya?

43:31.513 --> 43:33.314
Now do you know?

43:33.382 --> 43:34.648
I think I need
to hear that again.

43:38.954 --> 43:39.987
Hey.

43:40.055 --> 43:42.121
Nice day for a ride.

43:42.189 --> 43:43.590
I thought I'd give you a hand.

43:43.657 --> 43:44.924
Well, I appreciate the help,

43:44.992 --> 43:46.960
but I don't want to get
too used to it.

43:47.027 --> 43:49.261
Well, get used to it.

43:50.564 --> 43:51.831
Are you serious, Lou?

43:51.899 --> 43:53.600
I mean, what about Peter?

43:54.534 --> 43:56.035
You know what?
Even when I'm in Dubai,

43:56.103 --> 43:58.704
it's like we're having
a long distance relationship.

43:58.771 --> 44:00.438
So what difference
does it make, you know,

44:00.506 --> 44:02.440
actually having some
real mileage between us

44:02.508 --> 44:03.842
and not just some job

44:03.910 --> 44:07.679
that takes up all his time
and energy 24/7?

44:07.747 --> 44:09.648
So, you're really
not going back?

44:09.716 --> 44:11.216
Not planning to.

44:12.151 --> 44:14.485
At least not any time soon.

44:17.623 --> 44:18.823
It's good to be back.
