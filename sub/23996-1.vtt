00:25.459 --> 00:27.837
My life was perfect.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.730
I had an incredible
mom who loved me.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.434
I was her princess and she
kept me safe from everything.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.547
The only pain I ever knew was
when I tripped and skinned

00:37.571 --> 00:41.542
my knee but my mom was always
there to make it all better.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.845
Dad left before I was
born so it's always

00:54.555 --> 00:58.135
I actually believed that
until two years later

00:58.159 --> 01:00.704
when I learned what
pain really was.

01:00.728 --> 01:02.330
The day my mom left, too.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.379
- That funeral was way too long.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.847
She didn't do squat
with her life

01:10.871 --> 01:12.882
you think that they could've
shortened all that talk.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.351
- I'm hungry.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.153
- Oh, I know, the
food was terrible.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.112
Let's go see what we
have in the fridge.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.463
And here's your room.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.665
Our neighbor's grandmother
died so they gave us her bed

01:28.689 --> 01:30.591
so you be sure to be grateful.

01:31.559 --> 01:32.702
- Okay.

01:32.726 --> 01:36.206
- I know it's a little
plain right now

01:36.230 --> 01:39.143
but tomorrow morning we'll
talk to Uncle David

01:39.167 --> 01:40.310
and see what he
thinks about letting

01:40.334 --> 01:42.279
you decorate a little
bit, how's that?

01:42.303 --> 01:43.747
Won't that be nice?

01:43.771 --> 01:44.771
- Okay.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.918
- Look, I understand
that your mom just died

01:48.942 --> 01:51.855
but I will not have
you moping around.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.457
You will have chores
to do and you'll

01:53.481 --> 01:55.349
be expected to help
around the house.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.527
- Okay.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.596
- And you will be keeping
this room clean.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.423
You're 10 years old, there's
no excuse for messiness.

02:03.557 --> 02:04.868
- Okay.

02:04.892 --> 02:05.702
- All right, well, we will talk

02:05.726 --> 02:08.437
about your chores
in the morning.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.306
Goodnight.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.330
- Goodnight.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.238
- Well, Mrs. Wiggins, we
can't stay in bed all day.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.586
Time to get up.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.223
- Mom, my phone screen cracked.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.382
- Well honey, get a new
one right after school.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.760
- Kaitlyn, you want it?

03:03.784 --> 03:04.784
- Ew, no.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.055
- Can I have it?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.470
- Indy, hurry up.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.971
I have an early morning
meeting today.

03:14.995 --> 03:16.297
- Sorry, I...

03:24.772 --> 03:27.517
- Bye, girls, have a great day.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.886
- Oh, I'm going shopping
with Jayda after.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.645
- Okay, have a great time.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.318
Good morning, Mrs. Whitman.

03:43.424 --> 03:45.225
- This is life.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.005
Every school has their
social stereotypes

03:49.029 --> 03:52.466
like the band geeks, the
jocks, the underachievers,

03:53.934 --> 03:56.780
I guess I fit in with the
too-normal-to-classify kids.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.639
Certainly not with
the popular crowd.

03:59.973 --> 04:02.242
I'll leave that
to Bryant Bailey.

04:02.876 --> 04:05.279
Ugh, so annoying.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.625
Some girls throw themselves
at Bryant all the time

04:08.649 --> 04:11.361
and I really don't
understand it.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.253
Jayda and Kaitlyn especially.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.300
But there's a lot I
don't get about them.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.302
That one's Bryant's
sister, MacKenzie.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.305
I don't know her but
she seems decent.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.431
At least she has a reason
to be around Bryant.

04:25.065 --> 04:26.743
- So some of you haven't...

04:26.767 --> 04:29.048
- Moving on then, it's
class after class.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.037
History,

04:32.373 --> 04:33.407
English,

04:35.343 --> 04:36.786
and P.E.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.413
Ugh, how I hate P.E.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.318
And I get this every day.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.698
They get to eat out
every day but Clarise

04:48.722 --> 04:49.766
never gives me money for that.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.067
- Hey, Indy.

04:51.091 --> 04:51.935
- Hi.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.803
And that's Maxton,

04:53.827 --> 04:56.630
he keeps me sane, as
best friends should.

04:59.933 --> 05:02.770
And that's my life
day in and day out.

05:04.905 --> 05:05.939
Isn't it grand?

05:10.744 --> 05:14.658
I mean, it's not perfect
but whose life is?

05:18.519 --> 05:19.529
Sometimes I wonder
what it would be

05:19.553 --> 05:21.021
like if Mom were still alive.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.394
With her I felt my
life was perfect.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.998
- Well, this is awful.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.160
You must've learned to
cook from your mother.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.415
- But after she died I didn't

05:38.439 --> 05:40.116
expect that to stay the same,

05:40.140 --> 05:43.944
but I also didn't
expect it to get worse.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.999
- Come on, Jayda,
we're gonna be late.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.601
- I'm coming.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.498
- No!

06:08.536 --> 06:09.536
- I'm so sorry.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.373
I didn't mean to, I
didn't even s...

06:17.177 --> 06:18.177
I'm so sorry.

06:25.753 --> 06:26.930
- It was fabulous of you

06:26.954 --> 06:29.065
to stop by the
other day, Bryant.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.134
- Yeah, you should
come by more often.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.471
- I didn't stop by,
I hit Indy's cat.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.839
- I totally forgot about that.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.442
- Hey, Indy.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.445
- Stop, he's gonna see me.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.779
Is he looking?

06:42.803 --> 06:43.880
- Yeah, he's coming this way.

06:43.904 --> 06:44.904
- Indy.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.383
- Let's go.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.652
- Wait wait, I need
to get my stuff.

06:48.676 --> 06:49.676
Wait.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.161
- Bye, Bryant.
- Bye, Bryant.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.195
- And there's my son.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.029
Hey, Bryant.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.466
- Thanks for stopping by, Dr.
Bailey.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.567
I'll get those sessions with

07:03.591 --> 07:05.469
the students scheduled
right away.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.493
- Thank you.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.572
- So, how'd it go?

07:08.596 --> 07:10.907
- Great, great, yeah,
I've got several patients

07:10.931 --> 07:12.175
that come to this
school and now I can

07:12.199 --> 07:13.843
hold counseling
sessions here without

07:13.867 --> 07:15.144
them missing too
much class time.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.546
- Cool.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.747
- Speaking of which,
shouldn't you be

07:17.771 --> 07:19.182
off to class yourself?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.750
- Yeah.

07:20.774 --> 07:21.774
Indy.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.712
- What's going on?

07:26.647 --> 07:28.191
- That's her.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.258
The one who owned the cat.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.226
- Oh.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.261
- Yeah, she's avoiding me.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.263
- Yes, I see that, yeah.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.865
Hey, it'll be all right.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.457
She'll eventually hear you out.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.862
- All right, see ya, Dad.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.765
- Are you ever gonna
let Bryant apologize?

07:45.933 --> 07:49.012
- Can't run and talk
at the same time.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.880
- That's not an answer.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.281
- Why should I?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.718
It would only give him
a clear conscience.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.153
- Yeah, and you're above that
whole forgiveness nonsense.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.154
- Right?

07:58.178 --> 07:59.889
Wait, no that's not...

07:59.913 --> 08:01.525
- Oh jeez, oh.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.549
You all right?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
- Karma hates me.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.235
What are you doing here?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.227
- Being a gentleman
and helping you up.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.205
- Little heads up next time.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.807
- Sorry.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.275
We still have class.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.176
- Hey.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.746
Are you just gonna
keep blowing me off?

08:22.770 --> 08:24.648
- What more do you expect?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.315
- I just wanna make
it up to you one day.

08:26.339 --> 08:30.043
- The best way to make it up
to me is to leave me alone.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.944
- Wait.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.760
Please forgive me, Indy.

08:36.784 --> 08:40.664
- Before you killed my cat you
hadn't even said two words

08:40.688 --> 08:43.056
to me and now you
expect me to be nice?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.860
No, Bryant, I won't forgive you.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.773
That cat was the last
gift I got from my mom

08:49.797 --> 08:54.201
before she died so
please leave me alone.

08:56.704 --> 08:57.704
I don't want your pity.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.021
- All right, Dad,

09:05.045 --> 09:06.623
it's your turn to cook tomorrow.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.691
- Already?

09:07.715 --> 09:08.858
- No takeout though.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.726
- Why not?

09:09.750 --> 09:10.960
- Yeah, why not?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.229
- Because we need to
eat a little healthier

09:13.253 --> 09:15.064
and that's your cop
out every time

09:15.088 --> 09:16.299
it's your turn to cook.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.602
- Hey, I'm the doctor,
I say it's healthy.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.260
- You're not that
type of doctor.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.098
- What's up, Bryant?

09:26.199 --> 09:27.276
- Just thinking.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.945
- Everything all right?

09:28.969 --> 09:31.014
- That girl that I
told you about.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.048
- Oo.

09:32.072 --> 09:32.882
- What's her name?

09:32.906 --> 09:33.717
- Okay.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.818
Shoo shoo, both of you.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.343
- Sweet, all right.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.790
- The one with the cat?

09:40.814 --> 09:41.814
- Yeah.

09:42.382 --> 09:43.617
Indy Zimmerman.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.930
Not sure I'm ever gonna
be able to apologize

09:46.954 --> 09:49.165
without her throwing
something at me.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.792
The cat was a gift from her
mom before her mom died.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.338
- Zimmerman, Indy.

09:55.362 --> 09:56.362
Or is it Cindy?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.208
- I...

09:59.232 --> 10:01.032
- She lost her mother a
few years back, right?

10:01.669 --> 10:03.412
- I don't know when.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.781
How do you know?

10:04.805 --> 10:06.650
- Okay, have a seat.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.674
Come on.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.920
Maybe if you know a
little bit more about her

10:10.944 --> 10:14.247
it'll help you apologize,
be a friend for her.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.654
- Indy, get down here!

10:25.959 --> 10:28.672
Indy, what is taking so long?

10:28.696 --> 10:30.740
Get down here now.

10:30.764 --> 10:31.764
- No.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.212
- Cindy Ella Zimmerman,
if you don't get

10:36.236 --> 10:39.749
your butt down here this second
you'll be grounded again.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.821
What is wrong with you?

10:44.845 --> 10:48.157
It is not a holiday, there
is no breakfast downstairs,

10:48.181 --> 10:50.393
David has work, the
girls have school,

10:50.417 --> 10:54.130
and I have people coming over
for a presentation at three.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.732
Remember?

10:55.756 --> 10:58.267
- Oh, my head is killing me.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.270
- Ugh, so you expect
us to eat cereal?

11:01.294 --> 11:04.865
- I'm sorry, I just don't
feel very good right now.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.902
- Ew, you look awful, too.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.716
Maybe I don't want
you spreading around

11:12.740 --> 11:14.951
whatever disease
it is you've got.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.978
Especially since I'm doing a
presentation on essential oils.

11:20.748 --> 11:24.427
Okay, all right,
we'll have cereal.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.262
We'll just have the
girls hide the mess

11:26.286 --> 11:27.855
and you can deal with it later.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.269
Hey, isn't this Jayda's shirt?

11:33.293 --> 11:34.503
- There was a stain on it,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.773
she said she didn't
want it anymore.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.307
- Well, you didn't
work very hard

11:38.331 --> 11:40.233
to get this out in the laundry.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.370
Get it out and get
it back to Jayda.

12:03.456 --> 12:04.901
- Hey, Maxton.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.435
- Oh, hey, what's up?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.004
Do you need something?

12:08.028 --> 12:09.405
- Uh, yeah, I was just
looking for Indy.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.339
Do you know where she is?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.808
She wasn't at school today.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.276
- I think she's at home.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.245
She text me earlier that
she had a killer headache.

12:16.269 --> 12:18.014
- Oh, that makes
sense why she's not

12:18.038 --> 12:19.949
at your game too, then, huh?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.285
- No, that's actually
pretty normal.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.288
Her aunt and uncle
are kind of strict.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.522
- Oh.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.091
- You still trying
to talk to her?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.392
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.094
- I'm sorry, dude, Mrs.
Wiggins was...

12:31.118 --> 12:31.928
- Wiggins?

12:31.952 --> 12:32.796
- Her cat.

12:32.820 --> 12:33.797
- Oh.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.822
- Yeah, anyway.

12:35.856 --> 12:36.933
Special cat.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.534
- Yeah, I got that.

12:38.558 --> 12:39.860
All right, thanks, Maxton.

12:46.099 --> 12:48.468
- Indy loves company,
her room is up here.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.414
Indy, are you there?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.540
I've got something that
will cheer you up.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.879
How are you feeling, sweetheart?

13:00.247 --> 13:03.592
- I'm actually a lot
better now that I slept.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.852
- Hey.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.398
- What in the world
are you doing here?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.367
- Look who it is.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.436
It's the boy who killed your cat

13:13.460 --> 13:17.473
and he wants to apologize and
he has a present for you.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.409
Isn't he the sweetest?

13:20.433 --> 13:21.610
- Very.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.971
- Well I still have
guests downstairs, so.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.206
So sweet.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.154
- What are you doing here?

13:31.178 --> 13:33.589
- I knew you'd say no so I
just came without asking.

13:33.613 --> 13:34.848
- Caught that part.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.260
What do you want?

13:37.284 --> 13:38.886
- I'd like us to be friends.

13:39.953 --> 13:40.953
- No.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.399
- Look, do you have something
against guy friends?

13:43.423 --> 13:46.126
- Of course not,
Maxton's my best friend.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.575
Look, I know you're only trying
to be my friend out of pity

13:52.599 --> 13:57.337
and I don't want that, I
want genuine friends.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.250
- Well, I'm genuinely
worried about you.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.119
Can't that be a start?

14:03.143 --> 14:04.587
- You are no more
worried about me

14:04.611 --> 14:06.013
than my aunt and uncle are.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.051
What's in the bag?

14:12.953 --> 14:13.987
Smells good.

14:15.088 --> 14:15.999
- This?

14:16.023 --> 14:18.525
Just a little peace offering.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.004
- Food?

14:21.028 --> 14:23.406
- Captain Jack's famous burger.

14:23.430 --> 14:24.473
- You're kidding.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.099
- And there's fries as well.

14:30.003 --> 14:32.615
I knew I'd get on your
good side eventually.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.574
- Don't push it, I'm starving.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.987
Why are you here?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.990
- Well besides feeling
bad about, you know,

14:41.014 --> 14:42.058
hitting your cat, I...

14:42.082 --> 14:43.459
- Murdering.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.952
You murdered my cat.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.922
- Besides feeling bad
about murdering your cat

14:51.191 --> 14:52.292
I don't know why I'm here.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.540
I just feel like this is where
I need to be so here I am

14:57.564 --> 14:59.575
and maybe you need me.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.677
- Great, now I'm just terrified.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.147
- Just hear me out.

15:04.171 --> 15:07.274
- This has absolutely
nothing to do with me.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.419
If you need to come
here to feel better

15:10.443 --> 15:12.355
about killing my cat then sure,

15:12.379 --> 15:15.024
placate yourself and
show up I guess,

15:15.048 --> 15:16.616
but to say that this is for me?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.563
That's where I'll
call you on it.

15:20.587 --> 15:25.592
If this had anything to do with
me you would leave me alone.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.059
- Okay.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.760
You're right.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.097
Maybe I need you.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.435
Look, can we just go on
a walk or something?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.071
- Why?

15:39.106 --> 15:40.106
- Fresh air.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.288
- I don't think I
can, I have chores.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.622
- Well, Clarise said
that her party's

15:46.646 --> 15:48.591
not gonna end for
another hour so.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.083
What if I had you back by then?

15:51.551 --> 15:53.453
- Fine, but we have to hurry.

15:57.024 --> 16:00.736
I love being around flowers,
they remind me of my mom.

16:00.760 --> 16:04.064
I remember she always used
to have lilies at our house.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.033
They're her favorite.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.180
- Do you miss your mom a lot?

16:10.570 --> 16:12.015
- Of course.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.283
It's kind of a weird
question to ask.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.077
- No, it's because I wanted
to tell you something.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.385
There's no easy way to say it
so I'm just gonna jump in.

16:26.719 --> 16:30.133
About five or six
years ago my dad came

16:30.157 --> 16:31.324
home from work pretty late.

16:32.792 --> 16:36.105
There was an accident and he was

16:36.129 --> 16:37.330
behind the car that got hit.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.000
The lady driving the
car was hit by a truck

16:43.136 --> 16:45.081
and then she swerved
into oncoming traffic

16:45.105 --> 16:46.682
and was hit again by a semi.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.084
- Stop.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.077
- He was the one who called 911.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.746
And he didn't say
how bad it was,

16:56.249 --> 16:57.760
only that she was dying

16:57.784 --> 17:00.053
and that she wasn't gonna
make it to the hospital.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.723
So he sat there and
he held her hand

17:05.092 --> 17:06.358
and he just let her talk.

17:07.560 --> 17:12.665
- Please tell Cindy that I
love her and she's my princess

17:15.202 --> 17:19.205
and no matter what I'll
be with her always.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.182
- I remember.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.828
I remember a guy coming up
to me before the funeral

17:32.852 --> 17:34.587
and saying those exact words.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.491
I had no idea it was your dad.

17:40.760 --> 17:44.473
- When I told him that
I had hit a girl's cat

17:44.497 --> 17:45.841
and her name was Indy,
he asked if your

17:45.865 --> 17:48.668
name was actually
Cindy Zimmerman.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.215
- Only my family
really knows that

17:52.239 --> 17:57.244
but Cindy Ella, that's
what she named me.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.356
- He mentioned that she used

18:00.380 --> 18:02.115
to call you her
little Cinderella.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.451
- She was quite the romantic.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.797
- He did everything he could
to take her mind off the pain

18:08.821 --> 18:12.235
and he told me that
he could just see

18:12.259 --> 18:14.661
and feel how much that
she cared for you.

18:16.663 --> 18:20.909
- I know that.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.169
I never doubted that.

18:23.270 --> 18:24.604
- I'm so sorry, Indy.

18:27.740 --> 18:28.740
- It's fine.

18:29.909 --> 18:31.511
Bad things happen to people.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.191
It's just the way the
world works, right?

18:35.215 --> 18:38.685
- Yeah, but, there's
more to it than that.

18:40.187 --> 18:41.221
- Like what?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.623
- Well yeah, bad
things happen but

18:45.192 --> 18:47.170
it's how you learn from those
things and those trials

18:47.194 --> 18:49.362
and how you help others
learn that defines you.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.532
- Sounds way too deep for me.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.206
- So, Jayda and Kaitlyn
are your cousins, right?

19:00.273 --> 19:01.116
- Yep.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.253
- And Jayda's the
senior and Kaitlyn's

19:04.277 --> 19:05.788
a sophomore like you, right?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.523
Or did I mix that up?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.547
- No, you're right.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.760
- They just pretty much
leave you alone up here?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.586
- I actually prefer to be alone.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.488
Hint hint.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.595
- It is different than
the rest of the house.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.840
Aren't there any other rooms?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.276
- Well, the master bedroom's
on the first floor

19:27.300 --> 19:30.213
along with some studies
and a guest room

19:30.237 --> 19:32.648
and there are four bedrooms
on the second floor.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.650
- So, let me get this straight.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.220
There are six actual bedrooms?

19:37.244 --> 19:39.855
- Well, the girls turned one
of them into a playroom.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.490
- And a guest bedroom.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.892
- Clarise always has that
ready for her guests.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.394
- So why not put you
in the toy room

19:45.418 --> 19:47.363
and move the toys elsewhere?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.721
- I really don't mind.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.894
What are you doing?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.198
- I know, I'm nosy.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.368
One question.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.272
Where are all your
dolls and stuff?

20:06.373 --> 20:07.583
- My dolls?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.017
- Well, yeah, your
cousins have so many

20:09.041 --> 20:10.743
they needed an extra
room for 'em.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.778
Where are yours?

20:13.780 --> 20:15.848
- I guess I really
never had many.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.387
Mom enjoyed experiences
more than things.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.690
- Okay, but you were 10.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.034
I mean, I expected at
least to see a teddy bear

20:26.058 --> 20:27.336
or something on your bed.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.396
Or maybe even things
of your mom's.

20:31.030 --> 20:36.235
- Well the funeral expenses
were too high, so.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.946
- So?

20:37.970 --> 20:40.349
- So we had to sell
a lot of stuff.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.049
- Really?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.309
- Yeah.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.313
The only thing I got to
bring with me was my cat.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.249
- Hey, Indy, mom said
Bryant Bailey is here.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.729
So you are here.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.997
- Yep.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.401
- So, Bryant, what
brings you here?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.425
How are you doing?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.069
- I'm good.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.895
I was just talking to Indy.

21:03.963 --> 21:04.963
- About what?

21:06.065 --> 21:07.065
- Death.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.346
Is Clarise done with
her presentation yet?

21:10.370 --> 21:12.648
- Yes, thankfully it just ended.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.383
So what are you doing
tomorrow night, Bryant?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.318
We're having a few friends over

21:15.342 --> 21:16.919
to hang out and watch a movie.

21:16.943 --> 21:17.943
You wanna come?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.557
- Sure, that sounds fun.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.826
- Jayda, mom said
that Bryant's here.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.452
- He is, we're in the attic.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.722
- How long have you been here?

21:31.358 --> 21:34.394
- Uh, well Indy and I have
been talking for awhile.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.473
Quite, quite awhile, actually.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.974
I should get going.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.367
- You don't have to go.

21:41.701 --> 21:42.978
- Got homework.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.079
- It's Friday.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.405
- I'm committed.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.717
I'll see you all tomorrow.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.741
Okay.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.595
- Indy!

21:59.619 --> 22:00.619
Oh, ew.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.066
Do you know how long my
girls and I had to work

22:04.090 --> 22:05.725
to get this place
looking decent?

22:07.093 --> 22:08.471
- Um, I'm sorry.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.105
- You should be.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.331
Your little vacation
is over, missy.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.479
Everything needs
to be cleaned up.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.147
I want my oils
packed away neatly

22:19.171 --> 22:21.917
and this entire area
scrubbed from top to bottom.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.986
The girls are having
their own party tomorrow

22:24.010 --> 22:26.979
and I want everything to
be absolutely amazing.

22:27.914 --> 22:28.991
- Okay.

22:29.015 --> 22:33.095
- That means dusting and
sweeping, mop, bathrooms.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.688
Oh, don't forget to
make fresh snacks.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.002
- I don't know if I can get
all that done tonight.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.405
- Well, of course not.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.773
The snacks need to be
fresh so you get up early

22:44.797 --> 22:47.042
in the morning and do those.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.144
- Got it.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.546
Anything else?

22:50.570 --> 22:51.947
- Yes.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.482
Since you weren't
feeling well today

22:53.506 --> 22:55.518
I think it's best that
you just stay tucked

22:55.542 --> 22:57.553
away in your room
during the party.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.378
You know, in case
you're contagious.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.517
- Didn't think I was
invited anyway.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.105
- Hey, let me help.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.129
- Hi.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.108
- You feeling better?

23:20.132 --> 23:21.043
- Much.

23:21.067 --> 23:21.777
How was your soccer game?

23:21.801 --> 23:23.178
- It was a tie.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.112
- Better than a loss.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.176
- It was so close, though.

23:28.875 --> 23:29.875
Here, I got you.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.921
- Thanks.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.690
- So you doing
chores all day or?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.024
- Yeah, cleaning and baking.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.026
- Need any help?

23:38.050 --> 23:39.895
- I mean, I'd love
some but Clarise

23:39.919 --> 23:41.830
would probably say I'm
not working hard enough.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.098
- Probably, yeah.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.166
- Thanks anyway, though.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.768
- Yeah.

23:45.792 --> 23:46.902
I'll see you Monday.

23:46.926 --> 23:47.736
- See you Monday.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.861
- Okay, bye.

24:01.207 --> 24:02.818
Oh my gosh, hi.

24:02.842 --> 24:03.652
- Come on in.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.120
How are you?

24:05.144 --> 24:07.255
- Okay, so food's over here.
- There's food in there.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.924
- Thank you so much,
it's so good to see you.

24:08.948 --> 24:09.948
Come on in.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.529
Okay, so this is all
the food we have.

24:13.553 --> 24:15.197
It's really good, we
worked super hard

24:15.221 --> 24:16.965
on it getting it ready.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.607
- Guys, you're so sweet.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.675
Grab what you want.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.722
Hi!

25:01.768 --> 25:04.112
- I'm so glad that
you could come.

25:04.136 --> 25:04.947
- Thanks.

25:04.971 --> 25:06.148
- Hi, Bryant.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.640
- Hey, Bryant.
- Hey, everybody.

25:08.975 --> 25:10.218
Where's Indy?

25:10.242 --> 25:11.186
- Oh, why don't you
go get some food

25:11.210 --> 25:12.688
and then come watch the movie?

25:12.712 --> 25:14.146
- I saved you a seat, Bryant.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.933
- Mom,

25:35.267 --> 25:38.270
I miss you so much.

25:53.786 --> 25:54.786
Whoa.

25:55.855 --> 25:58.858
- Do you know how hard it is
to find you in your own house?

25:59.759 --> 26:01.093
You've gotta be freezing.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.282
How long have you
been hiding out here?

26:05.297 --> 26:08.300
- Thanks, but I wasn't hiding.

26:11.237 --> 26:12.815
How's the party?

26:12.839 --> 26:15.708
- Fine, but it was
missing something.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.243
- What?

26:19.712 --> 26:20.712
- You.

26:23.950 --> 26:25.661
Do you not like being
around big groups?

26:25.685 --> 26:27.830
- I already told you
I wasn't hiding.

26:27.854 --> 26:30.298
- Then why weren't you
hanging out with us?

26:30.322 --> 26:32.635
- I'm just tired,
had a long day.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.335
- Yeah?

26:33.359 --> 26:34.903
What'd you do today.

26:34.927 --> 26:37.272
- I cleaned and I cooked.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.374
- Did you make all the
food in there tonight?

26:39.398 --> 26:40.342
- Yeah.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.910
- It was good.

26:41.934 --> 26:42.934
- Thank you.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.171
- Hey, Indy?

26:49.876 --> 26:51.878
When your cousins
invited me tonight

26:53.245 --> 26:54.847
didn't that include you too?

26:56.749 --> 26:59.394
- We don't really
hang in the same

26:59.418 --> 27:01.730
social circles or anything so.

27:01.754 --> 27:04.857
- Yeah, but you made everything
for their party tonight.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.693
- Yeah.

27:08.260 --> 27:10.362
I mean, look, it's
really not a big deal.

27:11.798 --> 27:12.798
- Wow.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.778
You're literally Cinderella.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.871
- No, Cinderella's just
a name my mom loved,

27:19.939 --> 27:21.049
it's not who I am.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.918
- Well it fits you perfectly.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.920
- I prefer Indy much better.

27:24.944 --> 27:26.054
- All right.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.078
Well, come on.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.719
Let's get you out
of your prison.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.957
- Okay, but I'm not Cinderella.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.365
This is so good.

27:48.234 --> 27:49.401
- I'm glad you like it.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.247
My mom used to bring
me here all the time.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.949
- Why'd she stop?

27:53.973 --> 27:57.043
- She died about 10 years ago.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.111
- How'd she die?

28:00.813 --> 28:03.015
- It was sudden, like your mom.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.929
One minute she was riding her
bike to work and the next

28:06.953 --> 28:10.890
she was hit by somebody who
was texting and driving.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.126
- How'd you get through it?

28:15.027 --> 28:16.829
- Well, I missed her like crazy.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.975
She was riding her
bike because she and I

28:19.999 --> 28:23.211
were doing this child-parent
triathlon that Summer.

28:23.235 --> 28:26.281
We would go out in the
evenings and ride our bikes,

28:26.305 --> 28:28.908
wake up early, go to the
swimming pool and practice.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.319
- Wow.

28:31.343 --> 28:33.956
Did you still end up doing it?

28:33.980 --> 28:35.014
- By myself?

28:36.448 --> 28:37.559
No.

28:37.583 --> 28:41.496
That day of the triathlon I
just curled up in my bed

28:41.520 --> 28:42.922
and didn't move all day.

28:45.091 --> 28:50.096
Everyone seemed to forget
about the race but I didn't.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.301
That was the day that
I cried the most.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.004
- I'm so sorry.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.012
- Well, I think that we
should do this more often.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.058
- What, share grief stories?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.951
- No, get to know each other.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.030
It's how relationships start.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.365
- Whoa, you need to slow down.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.758
I don't know you,
you don't know me.

29:20.893 --> 29:23.138
You think we're starting
a relationship now?

29:23.162 --> 29:25.007
- I don't know, maybe.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.910
Besides, all friendships
are relationships

29:27.934 --> 29:29.344
and I just wanna get
to know you better.

29:29.368 --> 29:30.946
What's so wrong with that?

29:30.970 --> 29:32.580
- It's gonna be a little hard.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.715
- Why?

29:33.739 --> 29:37.052
- If Clarise even knew that
I was here right now she...

29:37.076 --> 29:38.277
- She'd lose it.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.511
- You have no idea.

29:41.914 --> 29:44.817
She's not really into me
having relationships.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.406
- So what are you
really trying to say?

29:49.421 --> 29:50.498
- I'm saying you're
probably better off

29:50.522 --> 29:53.125
trying to start a friendship
with one of my cousins.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.562
- What if I don't wanna
get to know them better?

29:57.997 --> 29:59.717
- They seem like they
wanna get to know you.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.912
Speaking of which,
aren't they gonna notice

30:03.936 --> 30:05.213
you left their movie party?

30:05.237 --> 30:08.616
- They may have but they
were just gossiping

30:08.640 --> 30:10.953
and didn't seem to
see me slip out.

30:10.977 --> 30:13.155
Plus, I like to hang
out with kind girls,

30:13.179 --> 30:15.114
and from what I've
noticed they're not.

30:20.352 --> 30:23.455
- Hey, thank you for tonight.

30:24.556 --> 30:25.633
- Yeah, it was fun.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.657
Thanks for coming.

30:28.227 --> 30:32.040
Would you wanna go another
date next weekend?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.099
- This wasn't a date.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.266
- Then what was it?

30:36.302 --> 30:37.445
- Bryant, you and I are from

30:37.469 --> 30:40.148
two completely different worlds.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.616
- So?

30:41.640 --> 30:44.619
- So I'm not the kind of person
you typically hang out with.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.389
- But you're exactly
who I wanna be around.

30:47.413 --> 30:51.150
- And you, look, you're
just not my type, okay?

30:53.085 --> 30:57.599
- Is that the real reason?

30:57.623 --> 31:00.002
- I could get in
a lot of trouble

31:00.026 --> 31:02.670
for being with you right now.

31:02.694 --> 31:03.906
- What's wrong with me?

31:03.930 --> 31:05.173
- It's not you, it's me.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.633
- Wow, are you breaking
up with me already?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.679
- My aunt doesn't
like me staying out.

31:11.703 --> 31:15.117
People at school are gonna
notice and they're gonna talk.

31:15.141 --> 31:17.619
- All right, well let's
do it this way then:

31:17.643 --> 31:19.054
we'll just keep our
relationship...

31:19.078 --> 31:20.112
- Friendship.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.259
- A secret for a couple of
weeks and see how that goes.

31:24.283 --> 31:29.288
I wanna hang out with you as
friends and maybe more one day.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.170
Look, it's getting
late, Cinderella.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.172
Let's get you inside before
you turn into a pumpkin.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.641
- Don't call me Cinderella.

31:39.665 --> 31:42.077
- I don't know if you've
noticed but your aunt

31:42.101 --> 31:44.270
and cousins are playing
their parts to a T.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.371
- Whatever.

31:47.339 --> 31:48.339
- Hey, wait.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.547
Can I get my shirt back?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.251
- Sure.

32:02.321 --> 32:06.258
- Goodnight.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.074
- As we explore the findings
of Shakespeare's Hamlet

32:12.098 --> 32:14.142
I want you to pay
particular attention

32:14.166 --> 32:17.612
to the following scene
as to how you can use it

32:17.636 --> 32:19.105
in our everyday lives.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.650
William Shakespeare wrote
relatable characters

32:22.674 --> 32:26.245
so well that after hundreds of
years we can still enjoy it.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.357
Even though life was a
whole lot different

32:29.381 --> 32:33.261
for them than it is now,
we still had same needs,

32:33.285 --> 32:35.087
desires, and problems.

32:36.688 --> 32:38.033
Just like you.

32:45.797 --> 32:46.797
- Indy.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.011
Indy, where you going?

32:49.035 --> 32:52.238
- Oh, sorry, I was
looking for somebody.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.706
- What's gotten into you?

32:56.475 --> 32:57.285
- What?

32:57.309 --> 32:58.309
- You're smiling.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.080
- I smile.

33:01.747 --> 33:02.657
- Okay.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.684
So anything new going on?

33:13.259 --> 33:14.469
All right, spill.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.493
What's going on?

33:17.363 --> 33:18.273
- Nothing.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.741
- Oh, I'm not that stupid.

33:19.765 --> 33:22.468
Now share, please already
or I'll get a complex.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.537
- When have you ever
gotten a complex?

33:28.174 --> 33:30.376
- You are avoiding
the question, ma'am.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.721
You don't wanna
talk, that's fine.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.124
But so you know, the next
time you wanna know something

33:36.148 --> 33:38.093
I'll leave you hanging, too.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.117
- That's not fair.

33:40.219 --> 33:41.663
It's a secret.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.232
- Oh, come on, I'm not gonna
tell anybody, all right?

33:44.256 --> 33:45.267
I won't say a word.

33:45.291 --> 33:46.291
- Okay.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.594
You have to keep
your mouth shut.

33:49.761 --> 33:50.761
- What'd you do?

33:53.332 --> 33:54.366
- Bryant Bailey,

33:59.171 --> 34:00.406
I think he likes me.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.017
- What?

34:03.041 --> 34:05.653
- Yeah, we went
out this weekend.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.222
- Wait, what?

34:07.246 --> 34:09.357
- I mean not on a date.

34:09.380 --> 34:14.353
I mean, I made sure not to
call it that but he wanted to.

34:15.454 --> 34:17.831
- What?

34:17.856 --> 34:18.856
- I know.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.570
It's really really
weird and that's why

34:22.594 --> 34:23.829
I wanna keep it a secret.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.541
I can't even wrap
my head around it.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.475
- Hang on.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.775
Seriously, you're not joking?

34:28.800 --> 34:29.944
- No.

34:29.967 --> 34:33.248
He came over Friday and then
he came over again Saturday

34:33.272 --> 34:36.583
and we actually have
a lot in common.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.609
- The Bryant Bailey?

34:38.744 --> 34:41.223
The guy you completely
despised, who killed your cat,

34:41.246 --> 34:43.158
and has been stalking
you ever since

34:43.181 --> 34:44.891
to apologize for
destroying your life.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.083
That Bryant Bailey?

34:47.219 --> 34:48.496
- Yeah.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.520
- Wow.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.168
I would not of expected it.

34:53.192 --> 34:54.202
- Me either.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.703
- He said he wants to date you?

34:55.726 --> 34:59.441
- Well, not in those
exact words but yeah.

34:59.465 --> 35:00.465
- Wow.

35:01.467 --> 35:02.877
That is crazy.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.246
So what'd he say when you told

35:04.270 --> 35:05.637
him you already had a boyfriend?

35:07.673 --> 35:08.673
- A what?

35:10.709 --> 35:11.709
Who?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.524
When did this happen?

35:16.548 --> 35:18.293
- Last year.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.827
- I didn't even know you
liked me like that.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.329
- Indy, I have always liked you,

35:21.353 --> 35:23.398
you just didn't
want a boyfriend.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.266
- I didn't?

35:24.290 --> 35:25.867
- I don't think so,
so I just hung back

35:25.891 --> 35:27.469
and we were just friends.

35:27.493 --> 35:28.336
- Until last year?

35:28.360 --> 35:29.571
- Yeah.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.239
It seems like it's
a shock to you.

35:31.263 --> 35:32.398
- Uh, yeah.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.210
I have History.

35:35.234 --> 35:35.843
- Talk later?

35:35.867 --> 35:36.867
- Definitely.

35:40.372 --> 35:43.885
- On page 275 you're going
to find a lot of information

35:43.909 --> 35:45.720
that you'll find
necessary to complete

35:45.744 --> 35:47.922
the worksheet before
the end of class.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.625
If you finish early you
can use the duration

35:50.649 --> 35:53.528
of your time to
prepare for a quiz

35:53.552 --> 35:56.931
that may or may not surprise
you sometime this week.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.301
We've been studying the
Declaration of Independence

35:59.325 --> 36:02.370
so that's a good clue on
what the quiz will be on.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.440
Remember, Thomas Jefferson
was he our third president

36:05.464 --> 36:06.874
but one of the main authors of

36:06.898 --> 36:08.376
the Declaration of Independence.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.669
I recommend that you write
that in your notes.

36:13.372 --> 36:15.241
- Hey, how was your day?

36:16.608 --> 36:17.608
- Interesting.

36:18.810 --> 36:20.412
Learned lots of revealing stuff.

36:22.481 --> 36:27.353
So, what happened to
change our relationship?

36:28.487 --> 36:29.731
- What?

36:29.755 --> 36:31.599
Oh, oh, okay, are
you talking about

36:31.623 --> 36:34.960
how I knew you had
just a burning desire

36:36.328 --> 36:37.572
in the deepest of your
heart to be with me

36:37.596 --> 36:39.465
even if you wouldn't
say it out loud?

36:40.432 --> 36:41.743
- I guess so.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.435
- Like how I'm having
fun with this?

36:45.937 --> 36:46.937
Sorry, um.

36:48.574 --> 36:52.878
Do you remember last
Summer you were sick

36:54.012 --> 36:58.660
and you asked me to come
over and I snuck out

36:58.684 --> 37:00.462
and I stayed the night with you

37:00.486 --> 37:02.964
and talked till you
had felt better?

37:02.988 --> 37:04.666
- I was pretty delirious.

37:04.690 --> 37:09.661
- Yeah, but for the first time
I saw how scared you were.

37:11.963 --> 37:15.367
You showed me how scared you
were and it was awesome.

37:16.568 --> 37:20.706
Not for you, obviously, you were
all sneezy and feverish but

37:22.674 --> 37:25.687
you've always been
this tough, fun girl

37:25.711 --> 37:28.680
and then you needed
someone and, I dunno,

37:30.382 --> 37:32.318
I thought things changed then.

37:34.486 --> 37:38.757
- Well, I guess
they did, I just...

37:39.991 --> 37:41.793
- You just didn't
see us as an item.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.496
- I saw us as best friends.

37:46.832 --> 37:49.411
- Yeah, and I saw us as
boyfriend and girlfriend

37:49.435 --> 37:52.571
because I thought I was the
closest thing to that for you.

37:54.072 --> 37:58.520
- So after last Summer why
didn't you say something

37:58.544 --> 38:01.323
or try and take me out
or kiss me or something?

38:01.347 --> 38:02.590
- Kiss you?

38:02.614 --> 38:04.759
You're not the kissing type.

38:04.783 --> 38:08.787
No, no, no, sorry, not that
I don't want to I just

38:10.622 --> 38:12.800
got the feeling you weren't
ready for that yet.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.394
- I didn't even know we
were in a relationship.

38:16.595 --> 38:17.595
- Now that you do?

38:24.370 --> 38:27.373
Yeah, sorry, I decided I wasn't
gonna hold back anymore.

38:28.607 --> 38:31.653
Apparently I am awesome at
this communication thing

38:31.677 --> 38:32.854
so let me try this again.

38:32.878 --> 38:33.878
I, um.

38:35.581 --> 38:38.049
I, I wanna be your boyfriend.

38:40.619 --> 38:41.620
- Thank you?

38:44.390 --> 38:46.492
- All right, is that a yes?

38:48.460 --> 38:52.707
- I need some more
time to think.

38:52.731 --> 38:55.467
- Yeah, do you wanna go
somewhere and do something fun?

38:56.702 --> 38:57.512
- When?

38:57.536 --> 38:58.570
- Tomorrow after school.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.615
- Clarise will have a cow.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.450
- Clarise always has a cow,

39:02.474 --> 39:04.519
she's gonna have
to deal with it.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.813
You can tell her you're working
on a school project with me.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.849
- Okay.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.487
I'd like that.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.031
Hey, Mrs. Whitman.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.152
- Let me guess,
your aunt doesn't

39:38.176 --> 39:39.176
do much yard work?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.056
- I have much bigger problems

39:42.080 --> 39:43.090
to worry about right now.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.559
- Yeah, like what?

39:44.583 --> 39:47.161
- Maxton thinking
I'm his girlfriend.

39:47.185 --> 39:48.896
- Like a girl that's a friend?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.565
- Nope.

39:50.589 --> 39:52.967
- Do you think of yourself
as his girlfriend?

39:52.991 --> 39:53.991
- No, but.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.539
- Like have you guys
ever gone on a date?

39:57.563 --> 39:58.506
- No.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.574
- Or even held hands or kissed?

39:59.598 --> 40:00.808
- No.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.578
I mean I guess
today we did, but.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.112
- What?

40:05.136 --> 40:08.015
- He kissed me today when I
told him about me and you.

40:08.039 --> 40:09.817
- You told him about us?

40:09.841 --> 40:12.587
- He's my best friend and
he could tell something

40:12.611 --> 40:14.456
was up the minute I
walked in the room

40:14.480 --> 40:16.090
and he started hounding
me and hounding me

40:16.114 --> 40:17.683
and finally I gave in.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.127
But it backfired.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.764
- Well, I guess now things
just get interesting.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.466
- What do you mean?

40:24.490 --> 40:27.635
- Have you ever thought
about giving him a chance?

40:27.659 --> 40:28.936
- You're giving up already?

40:28.960 --> 40:32.206
- Well, you guys have
been friends for forever,

40:32.230 --> 40:33.799
he definitely has a lead on me.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.212
- I have never seen
him in that way.

40:38.236 --> 40:41.683
Besides, what if I start
liking Maxton more than you?

40:41.707 --> 40:43.174
- So you're saying
that you like me?

40:44.109 --> 40:45.210
At least a little bit.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.591
I will be your friend
regardless, okay?

40:49.615 --> 40:51.526
- But what about Maxton?

40:51.550 --> 40:53.151
- I think you should
give him a chance

40:54.620 --> 40:57.122
but I do hope you realize that
I still want a chance, too.

41:04.630 --> 41:06.231
- I'm glad you came out with me.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.011
You're not afraid of
heights, are you?

41:10.035 --> 41:11.035
- No.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.839
Even if I was, though,
I'd stick it out.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.651
It's our first date.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.653
- I guess so, yeah.

41:18.677 --> 41:20.588
Now that we both realize it.

41:20.612 --> 41:23.290
♪ Anywhere you wanna
go let's go ♪

41:23.314 --> 41:26.728
So, just out of curiosity,
why all the awkwardness?

41:26.752 --> 41:28.830
You seemed shocked
I even like you.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.622
- I just never saw it.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.383
- You ever wonder why I ate lunch
with you every single day?

41:35.627 --> 41:37.739
- I thought it was because
we were best friends

41:37.763 --> 41:40.307
but I did notice all
your soccer friends

41:40.331 --> 41:42.734
asking you to go with them
and you saying no but

41:44.135 --> 41:45.980
was that because of me?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.906
- This is a trick question.

41:51.076 --> 41:53.745
Look, I like you, okay?

41:55.080 --> 41:58.593
I have for a long
time and Clarise

41:58.617 --> 41:59.894
won't give you lunch
money to go out to eat

41:59.918 --> 42:02.630
and she refuses to let you
make anything at home

42:02.654 --> 42:05.056
'cause she thinks
it's tacky, so.

42:06.692 --> 42:07.869
I don't know, when
you got embarrassed

42:07.893 --> 42:11.138
about only eating school
food I had my mom

42:11.162 --> 42:12.631
get me meal tickets, too.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.243
- Really?

42:16.267 --> 42:18.813
- Yeah, yeah, it didn't really
matter to me where I ate

42:18.837 --> 42:20.138
as long as I was with you.

42:21.607 --> 42:25.853
- And all your soccer
friends, they know?

42:25.877 --> 42:27.354
- Yeah.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.782
Soccer buddies tease me about
my girlfriend all the time.

42:32.183 --> 42:34.552
Mostly they just ask why you
never come to my games.

42:35.954 --> 42:36.954
- They do?

42:37.956 --> 42:40.735
- Yeah, I tell them
it's complicated,

42:40.759 --> 42:43.204
I know Clarise and
David don't really go

42:43.228 --> 42:46.140
for that kind of thing
and I didn't wanna make

42:46.164 --> 42:49.134
it harder on you so I never
really pushed it, I guess.

42:50.736 --> 42:53.705
- And all the times
we went out to lunch,

42:54.840 --> 42:56.608
you saw that as a date?

42:57.943 --> 42:59.186
- I guess so, I.

42:59.210 --> 43:00.321
I don't know.

43:00.345 --> 43:04.115
Look, I fail at this whole
relationship thing clearly.

43:10.388 --> 43:13.735
I know I'm not
Bryant Bailey, okay?

43:13.759 --> 43:16.771
That guy's his own
brand of whatever.

43:16.795 --> 43:17.795
What I'm.

43:19.430 --> 43:24.636
What I'm hoping is that you care
about me even if I'm not...

43:24.970 --> 43:25.970
- Hey.

43:28.339 --> 43:31.276
I care about you, okay?

43:34.012 --> 43:35.012
- Wow.

43:36.047 --> 43:37.992
- And I wanna come to
your next soccer game.

43:38.016 --> 43:39.284
- You mean this Saturday?

43:40.251 --> 43:41.428
- Yeah, what time?

43:41.452 --> 43:42.263
- Are you serious?

43:42.287 --> 43:43.287
What'll Clarise say?

43:44.389 --> 43:46.668
- I'll deal with that later.

43:46.692 --> 43:49.094
- Well if you're serious,
the game's at one o'clock.

43:50.295 --> 43:51.295
- Okay.

43:52.998 --> 43:57.402
- Indy, um, you know I
wanna be your boyfriend.

43:59.938 --> 44:00.938
What do ya think?

44:01.873 --> 44:05.386
- Can I just have some more
time to think about it?

44:05.410 --> 44:08.355
I just, I don't wanna
rush into anything.

44:08.379 --> 44:09.379
- Yeah, yeah.

44:10.048 --> 44:11.048
Sure.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.333
- Where have you been?

44:19.357 --> 44:21.292
- I was working on
a school project.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.806
- Something you
couldn't of done here?

44:24.830 --> 44:27.365
- It was a group
thing with Maxton.

44:28.967 --> 44:29.967
- Hmm.

44:31.269 --> 44:33.480
Well, get started
cleaning the house.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.916
- Okay.

44:34.940 --> 44:35.883
- And David wants
something other

44:35.907 --> 44:38.385
than pasta for dinner tonight.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.409
Think spicy.

44:40.746 --> 44:41.813
- I'll see what I can do.

44:53.391 --> 44:54.468
Hey, you.

44:54.492 --> 44:56.003
- Hey.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.172
So how was your
date with Maxton?

44:58.196 --> 45:01.175
You guys officially boyfriend
and girlfriend now?

45:01.199 --> 45:02.199
- Not yet.

45:03.769 --> 45:06.247
I never knew it,
but he's actually

45:06.271 --> 45:09.183
sacrificed a lot to
keep me company.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.207
- Like what?

45:11.109 --> 45:13.788
- Like he eats cafeteria
food every day

45:13.812 --> 45:15.890
just 'cause he knows
I always have to.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.315
- Why do you always have to?

45:18.549 --> 45:21.328
- I don't get money
to go out to lunch.

45:21.352 --> 45:23.130
- I see your cousins
go out all the time.

45:23.154 --> 45:25.466
- Well, that's part
of their allowance.

45:25.490 --> 45:27.234
If they keep their
grades up they get money

45:27.258 --> 45:28.326
every week to go out.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.996
- What do you do
with your allowance?

45:34.565 --> 45:35.910
Indy, come on, tell me.

45:35.934 --> 45:37.478
- Why should I?

45:37.502 --> 45:40.305
- Because I'm beginning to think
you don't get an allowance.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.985
Do Jayda and Kaitlyn
do any housework?

45:44.009 --> 45:47.188
- No, they're usually
busy during the day.

45:47.212 --> 45:50.257
They get home just in time for
dinner and then they crash.

45:50.281 --> 45:52.526
- So little Cinderella
does all the housework

45:52.550 --> 45:54.328
and if she doesn't get it
all done then Aunty Clarise

45:54.352 --> 45:56.230
gets angry and doesn't
refill her lunch card.

45:56.254 --> 45:59.300
- I don't exactly love
cleaning and cooking

45:59.324 --> 46:01.126
and being grounded
all the time but

46:03.194 --> 46:05.172
they're the only family I have.

46:05.196 --> 46:08.075
- Indy, why are you so nice?

46:08.099 --> 46:10.101
- I've been horrible
to you for weeks.

46:12.303 --> 46:13.815
- Wish there was a way that
I could just go back and...

46:13.839 --> 46:16.074
- Bryant, it's really okay.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.153
Mrs. Wiggins shouldn't
of run out into the road

46:19.177 --> 46:21.989
and it's actually
really bad of me

46:22.013 --> 46:24.149
to blame you for something
that's nobody's fault.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.593
I'm sorry.

46:26.617 --> 46:28.419
- Here you are being nice again.

46:30.155 --> 46:32.533
Well, I should
probably let you go.

46:32.557 --> 46:34.501
Wanna walk to school tomorrow?

46:34.525 --> 46:35.525
- Sure.

46:36.327 --> 46:37.327
- See you then.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.015
- Hey, you're still up?

46:48.039 --> 46:49.150
- Yeah.

46:49.174 --> 46:50.174
Couldn't sleep.

46:51.209 --> 46:53.454
So I've been hanging
out with Indy.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.356
- Oh, good, good.

46:55.380 --> 46:57.391
- She's really something.

46:57.415 --> 47:00.318
- So hanging out with is
really code for you like her.

47:02.520 --> 47:03.520
- Yeah.

47:04.522 --> 47:05.967
But I did something stupid.

47:05.991 --> 47:07.234
- What?

47:07.258 --> 47:08.870
- I encouraged her
to figure herself

47:08.894 --> 47:10.028
out with this other guy.

47:11.262 --> 47:12.262
I'm an idiot.

47:13.464 --> 47:15.642
- You're being a good friend.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.979
- But I don't want
her to date him.

47:18.003 --> 47:20.381
- Well are you gonna
do anything about it?

47:20.405 --> 47:21.405
- I don't know.

47:22.673 --> 47:26.144
- You have a good heart and
you're respecting her,

47:27.112 --> 47:29.456
you're letting her
make her own choice.

47:29.480 --> 47:30.480
- I guess.

47:31.649 --> 47:32.918
- She's special, huh?

47:37.956 --> 47:40.258
- Dad, you see a lot of
family stuff, right?

47:41.292 --> 47:42.904
With work?

47:42.928 --> 47:44.271
- Yes.

47:44.295 --> 47:46.407
- Is it uncommon for
families who take in orphans

47:46.431 --> 47:48.066
to treat them differently?

47:48.967 --> 47:50.344
- Why do you ask?

47:50.368 --> 47:52.170
- I've just noticed some things.

47:54.072 --> 47:56.107
It's like she's not an equal.

47:57.342 --> 47:58.342
Not even close.

48:00.979 --> 48:03.624
- Yeah, it happens and
sometimes without

48:03.648 --> 48:05.984
the people even realizing
they're doing it.

48:08.253 --> 48:09.253
Are you worried?

48:11.622 --> 48:12.622
- I'm not sure yet.

48:16.561 --> 48:17.561
- I hate running.

48:18.529 --> 48:20.207
- Apparently it's good for you.

48:20.231 --> 48:24.045
- So is math, doesn't
mean I have to like it.

48:24.069 --> 48:25.079
- Wuss.

48:28.039 --> 48:30.484
- Come on, let's finish
this lap so I can

48:30.508 --> 48:32.053
go die quietly somewhere else.

48:32.077 --> 48:33.478
- That's the spirit, here we go!

48:34.679 --> 48:36.290
- Hey, now you're
just showing off.

48:36.314 --> 48:37.524
- Yeah, every single day,

48:37.548 --> 48:39.117
it's nice to see you
finally noticing.

48:43.221 --> 48:44.221
- Hey you.

48:45.156 --> 48:46.156
- Hey.

48:47.092 --> 48:48.569
- Hey, instead of going
home do you wanna

48:48.593 --> 48:49.594
take a quick detour?

48:50.461 --> 48:55.242
- What did you have in mind?

48:55.266 --> 48:57.211
So this is your detour?

48:57.235 --> 48:59.404
- Yeah, I love playgrounds.

49:01.006 --> 49:02.049
I don't know, there's
just something about them

49:02.073 --> 49:04.551
that reminds me you're
never too old to have fun.

49:04.575 --> 49:07.121
- Okay, so what's your
favorite thing here?

49:07.145 --> 49:08.679
- Oh, by far the merry-go-round.

49:10.081 --> 49:11.625
I don't know, there's just
something so fun to me

49:11.649 --> 49:14.028
about spinning around
as fast as you can

49:14.052 --> 49:16.030
while trying not to get sick.

49:16.054 --> 49:17.331
Yeah, okay, there
was this one time

49:17.355 --> 49:19.000
when I was little, right?

49:19.024 --> 49:20.667
I was running as fast as my
little legs would let me

49:20.691 --> 49:23.104
and I was pushing it
so hard that I just

49:23.128 --> 49:25.539
completely flew off
and broke my arm.

49:25.563 --> 49:27.008
- Oh no.

49:27.032 --> 49:29.043
- Yeah, but I survived
and it didn't stop me

49:29.067 --> 49:31.212
from coming back
again and again.

49:31.236 --> 49:32.446
I mean, that is until
they got rid of

49:32.470 --> 49:34.781
the merry-go-round a
few years later, but.

49:34.805 --> 49:37.308
- I guess swings will have
to do for today, right?

49:39.744 --> 49:42.489
- Hey, us being here isn't gonna

49:42.513 --> 49:44.482
get you in trouble with
your aunt, will it?

49:45.616 --> 49:48.186
- I mean, as long as
we're not out too late.

49:49.554 --> 49:51.365
- Did, I mean, was
she cool about it

49:51.389 --> 49:54.092
when Maxton dropped you off
after your guys' date?

49:55.493 --> 49:57.504
- Not necessarily but
I told her we were

49:57.528 --> 49:59.540
doing a school project so.

49:59.564 --> 50:00.807
- How'd that work?

50:00.831 --> 50:03.477
- Not well, I had to
do a few extra chores

50:03.501 --> 50:04.445
around the house, but.

50:04.469 --> 50:06.147
- So you did get in trouble?

50:06.171 --> 50:08.582
- Kids get in trouble for that
kind of stuff all the time.

50:08.606 --> 50:10.051
- Yeah?

50:10.075 --> 50:12.253
I mean when I get in
trouble my dad just,

50:12.277 --> 50:14.488
I don't know, he
just chews me out.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.523
Sometimes he'll listen
when it's important to me

50:16.547 --> 50:19.260
but I've noticed that
when you get in trouble

50:19.284 --> 50:21.286
you just kinda become
Clarise's servant.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.666
Maybe what Maxton shoulda
done, and what any friend

50:25.690 --> 50:28.302
including me, should
do, is walk you in

50:28.326 --> 50:30.537
and take the blame
for making you late

50:30.561 --> 50:32.306
because chances are
at that point Clarise

50:32.330 --> 50:35.176
will kind of back way
down and be less harsh.

50:35.200 --> 50:36.643
Maybe in the end...

50:36.667 --> 50:38.412
- In the end she would
just wait for you to leave

50:38.436 --> 50:39.780
and then just chew
me out anyways.

50:40.638 --> 50:41.638
- Hey, Bryant.

50:45.176 --> 50:46.287
- Why is he with Indy?

50:46.311 --> 50:47.345
- Ugh.

50:49.247 --> 50:51.816
- Come on, we should
probably get you home.

50:55.853 --> 50:57.431
- There's no way I can lie now,

50:57.455 --> 50:59.300
the girls already
saw us at the park.

50:59.324 --> 51:00.534
- You'll be fine.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.627
- Speak of the devil.

51:04.129 --> 51:05.239
- I'm here.

51:05.263 --> 51:07.508
- No, Bryant, just go home.

51:07.532 --> 51:08.532
I'll be fine, okay?

51:11.536 --> 51:12.813
What are you doing?

51:12.837 --> 51:14.472
- Exactly what I
should be doing.

51:15.906 --> 51:17.284
Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

51:17.308 --> 51:18.185
- Hi, Bryant.

51:18.209 --> 51:20.521
My girls said they
saw you at the park.

51:20.545 --> 51:21.755
They just left for the mall,

51:21.779 --> 51:23.490
they'll be so sad
they missed you.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.283
- Oh, well, tell 'em I say hi.

51:29.220 --> 51:31.198
Are we too late?

51:31.222 --> 51:32.766
Were you looking for Indy?

51:32.790 --> 51:34.301
- You know I was.

51:34.325 --> 51:36.303
Yesterday she was so
late getting home

51:36.327 --> 51:39.264
that I just wanted to make
sure she made it home today.

51:41.399 --> 51:42.309
- Do you need me to stay?

51:42.333 --> 51:45.312
- Oh, Indy will be
just fine without you.

51:45.336 --> 51:47.781
Now go ahead and have a
seat in the living room.

51:47.805 --> 51:49.307
- Thank you for walking me home.

52:00.385 --> 52:03.164
- You're walking on very
thin ice right now.

52:03.188 --> 52:04.798
I don't know what it is
you're trying to prove

52:04.822 --> 52:06.500
with Bryant Bailey but remember

52:06.524 --> 52:10.237
he is only being nice to you
because he killed your cat.

52:10.261 --> 52:12.539
My girls have had their
eyes on him for years

52:12.563 --> 52:15.242
and the last thing I need is
you getting in Jayda's way

52:15.266 --> 52:17.844
especially with prom
right around the corner.

52:17.868 --> 52:19.546
Go do your chores.

52:19.570 --> 52:21.172
We'll talk about this later.

52:23.441 --> 52:24.441
- Yes, ma'am.

52:37.555 --> 52:38.765
Hello?

52:38.789 --> 52:40.267
- Hey, what happened?

52:40.291 --> 52:42.603
- Nothing I haven't
heard before.

52:42.627 --> 52:44.338
- Well, let me know
if it gets bed.

52:44.362 --> 52:46.273
- I'm sure everything
will be okay.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.398
- I'm serious.

52:48.266 --> 52:49.610
- Okay.

52:49.634 --> 52:50.877
- Wanna walk to school tomorrow?

52:50.901 --> 52:52.946
- I actually probably shouldn't

52:52.970 --> 52:55.849
I have to go to Maxton's
soccer game on Saturday

52:55.873 --> 52:58.319
and I wouldn't wanna be
grounded before then.

52:58.343 --> 53:00.245
But, Bryant?

53:02.313 --> 53:03.957
Thank you.

53:03.981 --> 53:04.981
- Anytime.

53:05.650 --> 53:06.693
- Goodnight.

53:06.717 --> 53:10.931
- Goodnight.

- Maxton, are you okay?

54:31.702 --> 54:34.305
Come on guys, let's help him.

55:12.577 --> 55:14.044
- You did amazing.

55:15.613 --> 55:17.791
Is your leg gonna
be okay, though?

55:17.815 --> 55:19.526
- Oh yeah, I think so.

55:19.550 --> 55:21.528
I think it's probably
just bruised or sprained.

55:21.552 --> 55:23.730
I'll put some ice on
it when I get home.

55:23.754 --> 55:24.965
- Oh, hey, let me help you.

55:24.989 --> 55:25.989
- Oh, thanks.

55:27.625 --> 55:32.630
- So, besides the injury,
are you always that good?

55:34.599 --> 55:35.509
- You know what?

55:35.533 --> 55:38.469
Today I think I had
some extra motivation.

55:40.671 --> 55:43.717
Thank you for coming,
watching me play.

55:43.741 --> 55:44.951
It means a lot.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.620
- Of course.

55:46.644 --> 55:50.991
- You know, it's funny,
I've always liked you

55:51.015 --> 55:53.551
but I never never thought
I'd feel like this.

55:55.185 --> 55:56.185
I like this.

55:56.954 --> 55:57.954
I like us.

56:08.833 --> 56:12.002
- Come on, let's go get
some ice on your leg.

56:26.717 --> 56:28.385
Oh, it's you.

56:29.119 --> 56:30.119
- Nice welcome.

56:30.688 --> 56:32.466
So you back from
the soccer game?

56:32.490 --> 56:34.435
- Yeah, just barely.

56:34.459 --> 56:35.201
- How was it?

56:35.225 --> 56:37.003
Did Clarise get mad?

56:37.027 --> 56:40.707
- I actually don't think she
remembered I went to go study.

56:40.731 --> 56:43.176
I snuck in through the side
door so nobody would see me.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.802
- Indy, get down here!

56:45.870 --> 56:49.149
- Oh, sorry I have to go.

56:49.173 --> 56:50.684
Clarise is calling.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.653
- Calling or yelling?

56:52.677 --> 56:53.878
- Yeah, bye.

56:59.550 --> 57:00.550
- Have a seat.

57:03.187 --> 57:06.166
So would you like to tell us
where you really were today?

57:06.190 --> 57:07.825
And don't lie.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.672
- I was at Maxton's soccer game.

57:11.696 --> 57:15.542
- So you weren't
studying after all.

57:15.566 --> 57:16.634
And what about after?

57:18.235 --> 57:19.813
- After?

57:19.837 --> 57:21.782
I came straight home after.

57:21.806 --> 57:22.949
- Really?

57:22.973 --> 57:25.619
Because Clarise received
a call that would

57:25.643 --> 57:27.044
seem to imply otherwise.

57:28.546 --> 57:30.924
- Mrs. Whitman called
me and said that

57:30.948 --> 57:33.627
she saw you and
some boy making out

57:33.651 --> 57:34.895
in the middle of
the soccer field

57:34.919 --> 57:36.854
right there in front
of everyone to see.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.199
- What?

57:39.223 --> 57:42.536
We kissed once but I promise
we didn't make out.

57:42.560 --> 57:46.740
- Do you have any idea
how embarrassing it is

57:46.764 --> 57:49.242
to receive a call like that?

57:49.266 --> 57:50.266
- I'm sorry.

57:51.669 --> 57:53.580
- I have to go into my office.

57:53.604 --> 57:56.983
Do whatever you need
to do here, Clarise.

57:57.007 --> 57:57.818
Deal with her.

57:57.842 --> 57:59.553
- What?

57:59.577 --> 58:01.522
You're not leaving me here
to handle this by myself.

58:01.546 --> 58:02.756
What, do you want
her going around

58:02.780 --> 58:05.559
the neighborhood
like some floozy?

58:05.583 --> 58:08.729
- Well, with her mother what
would we really expect?

58:08.753 --> 58:10.163
- What's that supposed to mean?

58:10.187 --> 58:11.598
- Fix this.

58:11.622 --> 58:12.799
- No.

58:12.823 --> 58:14.383
Do you have something
you'd like to say?

58:15.593 --> 58:20.064
My actions, my
choices, are mine.

58:21.198 --> 58:24.201
So don't you dare pin
this on my mother.

58:25.570 --> 58:28.749
My mom loved me and cared for me

58:28.773 --> 58:32.853
and worked herself sick
trying to provide for me

58:32.877 --> 58:36.056
and she had nothing but nice
things to say about you two

58:36.080 --> 58:41.085
so I am done hearing how
awful you think she was.

58:41.819 --> 58:43.597
- You don't get to...

58:43.621 --> 58:47.000
- I know you don't want me.

58:47.024 --> 58:50.737
I knew it the moment I
showed up to stay with you.

58:50.761 --> 58:53.774
I was just some poor
relative who was coming

58:53.798 --> 58:58.803
to intrude on your lives but
I was loved before this

58:59.837 --> 59:01.772
and I know the
difference between this

59:02.973 --> 59:06.010
and what a real family is
supposed to feel like.

59:07.612 --> 59:11.682
I have done everything you have
asked me to do, everything,

59:13.250 --> 59:15.319
and it is sill not enough.

59:17.287 --> 59:20.601
Sure, Jayda and Kaitlyn
get to go on dates

59:20.625 --> 59:24.795
and see their friends
and have normal lives

59:27.064 --> 59:28.064
but not me.

59:29.299 --> 59:33.203
What is it going to take for
you to see me as family?

59:37.041 --> 59:41.922
- Oh, oh, missy, how
entertaining was that?

59:44.348 --> 59:45.750
- I'm serious.

59:46.651 --> 59:47.718
- You want serious?

59:48.819 --> 59:52.766
If you don't learn to respect
both of us in this home

59:52.790 --> 59:55.793
you can find another
place to stay.

59:59.864 --> 01:00:04.010
- And what is respect
to you, Uncle David?

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:06.112
Doing all the chores?

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:10.083
Staying away during
family events?

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:14.054
Living in the attic and not
having a life outside of school

01:00:14.078 --> 01:00:18.859
until you tell me to come
make dinner for you?

01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:19.884
Is that respect?

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:24.865
Because if so, what of that
have I not been doing?

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:28.368
- You're acting as if we're
treating you like a maid.

01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:32.739
Oh, after everything
that we did after all

01:00:32.763 --> 01:00:36.701
the things we changed to make
room for you in our lives.

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.080
- Do you hear yourself?

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.347
- Enough.

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:44.150
You will go to your room and we

01:00:44.174 --> 01:00:46.319
will decide on a
punishment for you,

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:49.790
you selfish little brat.
- David!

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:52.349
- And let me tell you,
it will be severe.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
Go now.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.888
- Hey, Indy, I can't
really talk right now.

01:02:27.912 --> 01:02:30.056
- Sorry, did I wake you up?

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.291
- No, no, it's okay.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:33.794
It's just my ankle,
my mom made me go

01:02:33.818 --> 01:02:36.229
to the clinic to get an x-ray.

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:37.898
- Are you okay?

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:40.867
- Yeah, I should be, I'm
just still in a lot of pain.

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:41.992
Can I call you back?

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:43.894
- Um.

01:02:45.996 --> 01:02:47.798
I'm having a really rough night.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:51.500
It's bad here.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:53.814
- Yeah?

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:56.917
- It's probably the
worst it's ever been.

01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.985
- I'm sorry, maybe
just give your aunt

01:02:59.009 --> 01:03:00.220
some time to cool down?

01:03:00.244 --> 01:03:01.545
That usually works, right?

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:05.348
- I'm scared.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.861
- Oh, hey, the doctor
just came back in

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:09.930
so can I call you back tomorrow?

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:10.954
- Tomorrow?

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:12.966
Yeah, sure.

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.558
- Okay, uh, night.

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:54.640
- Wait a minute.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.664
Are you leaving?

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:00.837
Indy, what's going on?

01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:07.087
- I missed up really really bad.

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.212
- Okay, what happened?

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:12.125
- Guess one of the neighbors
called Clarise and told her

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:14.351
I was making out with
Maxton at his soccer game.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:17.287
- Uh, were you?

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:21.534
Sorry, that's not important.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:24.137
- We kissed, we didn't
make out, though.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.030
It was in front of
a group of people.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.333
- And your aunt chewed you out?

01:04:30.935 --> 01:04:31.935
- Her and David.

01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:34.414
And then David made a comment
about how he thought

01:04:34.438 --> 01:04:38.142
my mom raised me poorly
and I just lost it.

01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:42.112
All the stuff I had
pent up just came out.

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.158
And then David said
that if I disrespected

01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:46.326
them one more time
I'd be kicked out

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.395
and then he said my punishment
was gonna be really bad.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:52.098
- So you came upstairs
and started packing.

01:04:52.122 --> 01:04:53.157
- Yeah.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.670
- Did you tell him how unfair
it was that you're the maid

01:04:57.694 --> 01:05:00.006
and the cook and the
prisoner all while

01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:02.008
they get to go out and live?

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:03.443
- Sort of.

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:05.645
Look, it was awful.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:08.414
My filter was completely gone.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.438
- So now what?

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.143
- I don't know.

01:05:15.012 --> 01:05:16.313
- Do you need a place to stay?

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:21.285
- No, I'll be fine.

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:24.421
- Their threats aren't
going to get any better.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:26.766
Look, my dad's a family
therapist and he sees

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.635
this stuff all the time, and the
problem with abusive people

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.096
is that they just always
think they're right.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.931
- You think they're abusive?

01:05:35.699 --> 01:05:36.699
- Yeah.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:41.405
Their daughters are perfect
and you're not allowed to be.

01:05:43.207 --> 01:05:46.043
Excuses to keep you grounded,
not inviting you to things,

01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:48.651
not even giving you
a proper bedroom.

01:05:50.014 --> 01:05:52.125
The list goes on and on.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:56.396
- I mean it's bad
but it's not abuse.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.420
- Yes it is.

01:05:58.522 --> 01:06:00.166
It's definitely emotional
abuse which can be

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.992
so harmful and dangerous.

01:06:05.195 --> 01:06:08.108
Look, I think that you
need to come with me.

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:10.667
- Can I have time to
think about this?

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.215
- Actually, do you
mind if I call my dad

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:16.640
and just ask for his advice?

01:06:19.809 --> 01:06:21.321
I'll just be a second
but in the meantime

01:06:21.345 --> 01:06:23.547
you should really really
keep packing, okay?

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:33.657
Yeah, I'll tell her.

01:06:35.259 --> 01:06:36.259
Okay.

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:37.760
Bye.

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:41.041
- What'd he say?

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:43.400
- Well, he was obviously
concerned when I told him.

01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:47.680
What I didn't know is now
that I've told him by law

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:51.675
he's gotta tell child
protective services.

01:06:53.310 --> 01:06:54.310
- What?

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:56.480
Are you sure?

01:06:59.416 --> 01:07:01.594
- Indy, he could lose his
license if he didn't.

01:07:01.618 --> 01:07:03.329
- This is insane.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.522
- I know, but, look, I'm sorry

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:09.135
and I promise we'll
keep it private.

01:07:09.159 --> 01:07:10.594
- Bryant, I can't do this.

01:07:11.495 --> 01:07:12.605
Jayda and Kaitlyn...

01:07:12.629 --> 01:07:14.298
- No, this is not about them.

01:07:15.299 --> 01:07:16.299
This is about you.

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:20.613
My dad says that you
can come stay with us.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:22.315
He's certified to
take in foster kids

01:07:22.339 --> 01:07:25.175
and he really doesn't
think you're safe here.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.588
Look, I think that
you just need to

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:29.655
come to stay with us tonight.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.391
- I really don't think that

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:32.858
they're gonna hit
me or anything.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.260
- No, but they might just lock

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:35.161
you in your room or something.

01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:36.786
- They always do that.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.233
What, is that
considered abuse, too?

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:42.302
- I'm getting the
bags, we're leaving.

01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:43.703
- You didn't answer my question.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:44.727
- I don't need to.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:47.407
If they're going to
lock you in your room

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:49.575
for being a normal child,
imagine what they're gonna

01:07:49.599 --> 01:07:51.101
do when they're all upset.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.404
We're leaving.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:05.791
- Hey, come on in.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:06.815
Welcome, Indy.

01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:09.218
- Thank you.

01:08:10.154 --> 01:08:11.264
Your home is beautiful.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.089
- Oh, listen.

01:08:14.258 --> 01:08:16.902
I want you to feel as
comfortable here as you can

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.305
so I hope you don't mind that
your room is next to Bryant's.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:24.768
He is a boy and they, you
know, they stink sometimes.

01:08:26.336 --> 01:08:28.648
And I know you're really tired
but if you feel up to it

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:31.216
would you mind answering
some questions for me?

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:33.843
It'll help me know better
what to do in the morning.

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.256
Yeah?

01:08:37.281 --> 01:08:39.325
Okay, and then Bryant will
help you get settled after.

01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:40.550
Okay, just through here.

01:08:50.727 --> 01:08:52.562
Now just get some
rest for now, Indy.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:54.840
- I will.

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:56.633
And thank you for...

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.269
- Oh, we are happy to.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.216
Bryant, could you
show her to her room?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.274
- Come on, you can meet my
sisters in the morning.

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.149
- Here's your room.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:16.429
- Thanks.

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:17.554
- Yep.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.304
- What do you think
Clarise is gonna do

01:09:24.328 --> 01:09:25.871
when she realizes I'm not there?

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.439
- Don't worry about them.

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:29.475
Will you focus on
yourself for once?

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:32.345
- I just really hope I
did the right thing.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:34.314
- You did do the right thing.

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.706
Besides, you're
here with friends.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:38.941
- Okay.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.421
- All right, and if
you can't fall asleep

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.356
just shoot me a text, kay?

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.540
We'll go watch a movie in the
living room or something.

01:09:52.721 --> 01:09:53.721
- Thank you.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:56.825
For everything.

01:09:57.961 --> 01:10:00.364
- How did we get to this point?

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:02.775
- You killed my cat.

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:07.480
- And I'll never live that down.

01:10:07.504 --> 01:10:08.504
Ever.

01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:10.373
- Nope.

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:21.485
- Goodnight.

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:02.868
- Hey.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.570
- Ease up, save some
for everyone else.

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:08.474
- It's good.

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:09.909
- Morning.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:10.933
- Oh, hey.

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:14.013
Indy these are my sisters.

01:11:14.037 --> 01:11:15.715
This is MacKenzie and Roni.

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:17.717
I'm sure you know
MacKenzie from school.

01:11:17.741 --> 01:11:19.519
- We're glad you
could stay with us.

01:11:19.543 --> 01:11:21.645
I'm sorry the circumstances
aren't better.

01:11:22.812 --> 01:11:25.358
- I'm sorry I woke
up so late, I...

01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:27.393
- No worries, it's Sunday.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:28.417
- These are good.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.821
Indy, do you want syrup?

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:35.724
- Those are for me?

01:11:36.893 --> 01:11:37.893
- Yeah.

01:11:40.564 --> 01:11:42.466
- Um, yeah, tons.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:44.834
- Have a seat.

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:47.647
- Well, I hope we don't have

01:11:47.671 --> 01:11:50.583
any fist fights over
whipped cream this time.

01:11:50.607 --> 01:11:53.677
- I used up the last
of it yesterday.

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.822
- Oh, well that settles that.

01:11:56.846 --> 01:11:59.392
So you had a chance to
meet the rest of the gang?

01:11:59.416 --> 01:12:03.629
- Yeah, and thank you guys so
much for letting me stay here.

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.097
- Oh.

01:12:05.121 --> 01:12:06.699
Oh, you know, I've been on the
phone already this morning

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:08.592
and things are moving forward.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:10.503
I'll tell you more
about it after you've

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:11.595
had a chance to eat.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.408
Oh, you know, I've
been thinking.

01:12:15.432 --> 01:12:18.478
You know, we have that apartment
in the pool house out back,

01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:21.514
maybe you'd be more comfortable
staying out there.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:23.583
You know, you'd be
close to the family

01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:26.719
and to the house here but you'd
have a little privacy, too.

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:29.522
- Um, yeah, that's fine.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:31.980
- Excuse me.

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:35.751
- Eat up.

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:40.099
- Hi, you wanna come in?

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.567
- We need to take
Indy to her aunt

01:12:41.591 --> 01:12:42.735
and uncle's house
for an interview.

01:12:42.759 --> 01:12:45.170
- That is highly unusual.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:46.639
- They've hired a
powerful attorney

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:48.908
and he's assisting
that the venue be

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:50.643
the aunt and uncle's home.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:52.712
- No way, you are the
government representative

01:12:52.736 --> 01:12:54.414
you're supposed to
be keeping her safe.

01:12:54.438 --> 01:12:56.416
We are supposed
to keep her safe.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.149
- You know these things

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:59.151
take time and some finagling.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:00.252
They are the legal guardians...

01:13:00.276 --> 01:13:02.555
- So you want her to go
back over there right now

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:04.657
and face them after everything
she's been through?

01:13:04.681 --> 01:13:07.860
- We don't know what she's been
through, that's the point.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:10.496
But Officer Reid and I are
here to make sure she's safe.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.797
- Yeah, that or to force

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:14.567
her back to her aunt's house.

01:13:14.591 --> 01:13:16.993
- Dr. Bailey, please
work with me here.

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:21.006
- Indy?

01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:22.642
- How many pancakes did you eat?

01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:23.809
- A lot.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:24.644
Indy.

01:13:24.668 --> 01:13:25.945
- What's wrong?

01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:31.674
What's going on?

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:37.647
Indy!

01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:18.555
- Was this all a joke?

01:14:19.589 --> 01:14:20.589
- What?

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:23.068
- The whole saving me thing.

01:14:23.092 --> 01:14:24.092
- No.

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:26.672
- I trusted you.

01:14:26.696 --> 01:14:28.131
- Hey, you're not going back.

01:14:29.265 --> 01:14:31.067
- I heard them
talking, they said

01:14:32.536 --> 01:14:33.479
there was a police officer

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:35.715
there and they were saying
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:35.739 --> 01:14:36.749
Hey, hey, hey.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.117
Can I just explain?

01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:39.141
Please?

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:46.559
Your aunt and uncle are trying

01:14:46.583 --> 01:14:48.861
all sorts of excuses
and tactics.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:51.597
Some that my dad have already
dealt with this morning.

01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:53.957
They're moving fast
but there are rules

01:14:55.659 --> 01:14:57.770
and you are not
going back there.

01:14:57.794 --> 01:15:01.598
- But I heard them talking.

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:06.712
- Yeah, they were trying to
get you to do the interview

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:08.681
at Clarise's house with
Child Protective Services

01:15:08.705 --> 01:15:11.174
but my dad is dead
set against that.

01:15:12.275 --> 01:15:13.786
You should not have
to be anywhere

01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:15.545
where you're feeling
uncomfortable.

01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:18.691
- Interview?

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:21.160
- Yeah, look, you're
old enough to voice

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.729
your own opinion now
so my dad talked to

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:25.731
the Child Protective
Services lady

01:15:25.755 --> 01:15:28.224
and they agreed to let you
do it wherever you choose.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:34.530
- But why was there a
police officer there?

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:37.643
- That was just a
precaution, you know,

01:15:37.667 --> 01:15:39.078
in case you had to go
back to your aunt's house

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:40.804
they just wanted
you to feel safe.

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.877
- Why are you doing this for me?

01:15:49.879 --> 01:15:50.879
- Why wouldn't we?

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:55.961
Indy, I'm not gonna
sit there and watch

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:59.022
you be treated horribly
and neither is my dad.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:02.768
- I don't wanna be a burden.

01:16:02.792 --> 01:16:03.936
- You're not a burden.

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.297
- I just feel like I've been
causing a lot of problems.

01:16:10.734 --> 01:16:15.739
Your dad mentioned moving me
out to the pool house and I...

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:20.143
- You got banished to the
attic in Clarise's house.

01:16:21.978 --> 01:16:24.748
Indy, that is not what
we meant by that.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.160
My dad just thought
you might want

01:16:28.184 --> 01:16:30.053
some privacy or personal space.

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.833
Look, you are more than
welcome to stay in the house.

01:16:33.857 --> 01:16:36.769
Man, I'm sorry, we
should've thought of that.

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:40.329
- No, I'm sorry
for overreacting.

01:16:41.865 --> 01:16:42.899
- No, you didn't.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.803
- So everything's really okay?

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.207
- No, but it will be.

01:16:59.816 --> 01:17:00.817
- Thank you.

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:02.886
- Yeah.

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:05.689
Come on, let's go.

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:09.168
I thought you might
be needing these

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:10.803
since you ran outta the house
without 'em, all right?

01:17:10.827 --> 01:17:12.261
Come on, let's go.

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:19.835
- Indy!

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:24.207
Are you okay?

01:17:26.776 --> 01:17:28.353
- Yeah.

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:29.377
- Are you really?

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:33.249
- I'm sorry, I
just thought that.

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:36.962
I thought wrong.

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.999
- Well, that case worker,
she wants to talk to you

01:17:40.023 --> 01:17:42.835
first thing tomorrow
morning at her office

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:43.960
if that works for you.

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:47.439
- I guess, but
what about school?

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:48.874
- Well, I'll deal
with the principal,

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.142
you don't have to worry
about that right now,

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:51.334
this is more important.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:56.005
- What's gonna happen
after the interview?

01:17:57.841 --> 01:17:59.184
- Well, in a couple of
weeks we'll probably

01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:01.954
have to attend a
hearing on your behalf

01:18:01.978 --> 01:18:03.288
where I'll get a chance
to share my side

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:05.715
and your case worker
will share her side.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:08.293
- And what if we don't win?

01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:10.863
- Oh, don't worry, we will win.

01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:12.364
- But just in case.

01:18:12.388 --> 01:18:14.466
Do I have to go
back with Clarise?

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:16.926
- No, not again.

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:22.174
- What's gonna happen
to my aunt and uncle?

01:18:22.198 --> 01:18:23.809
- Honestly that's a
decision a judge

01:18:23.833 --> 01:18:25.878
is gonna have to
make and that is

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:27.837
not our concern
right now, you are.

01:18:28.972 --> 01:18:30.907
And if you're all
all right with it,

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.077
we'd like to be the
ones to look after you.

01:18:35.511 --> 01:18:37.056
- You already have been.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:39.224
- Well, I don't mean
just for the weekend,

01:18:39.248 --> 01:18:40.993
I mean I think we could be your

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:42.852
foster family if that's okay.

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:47.957
Bring it in.

01:18:54.898 --> 01:18:55.975
- What are you?

01:18:55.999 --> 01:18:57.843
- Oh, would you just smile.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:58.867
- I am.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:04.917
She is ruining our lives,

01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.952
dragging our names
through the mud.

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:08.553
- We're gonna stop her.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:09.955
- When's our lawyer get here?

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:10.979
- He's on his way.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.094
- Oh, that's good, that's good
- Thank you so much.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:17.396
- Absolutely.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.931
- Little brat.

01:19:18.955 --> 01:19:22.434
- Shut your mouth,
someone will hear you.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:23.458
- Yes, dear.

01:19:26.062 --> 01:19:27.306
Oh, sweetie.

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.875
- Uh, I'll walk you out.

01:19:29.899 --> 01:19:30.876
Dr. Bailey's waiting over here.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:31.901
- It's okay.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:36.215
- So, not too bad?

01:19:36.239 --> 01:19:37.582
- It was fine.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:38.984
- Good, good.

01:19:39.008 --> 01:19:40.008
Hard part's over.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:42.510
- Is it?

01:19:44.347 --> 01:19:46.049
- Well, one of the hard parts.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.516
How do you feel?

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:53.990
- Hopeful I guess is
the word, I just...

01:19:58.027 --> 01:19:59.027
- What?

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:02.407
- I'm nervous.

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:04.944
- I can understand that.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:08.848
You've got a lot of changes going
on in your life right now.

01:20:08.872 --> 01:20:10.506
- But I'm not just
nervous for me,

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.043
I'm nervous for them, too.

01:20:15.912 --> 01:20:17.489
Does that make any sense?

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:19.224
I mean, I realize that
they didn't treat me

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.994
the way they were
supposed to, but...

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.963
- But you still care for them.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:25.464
- Yeah.

01:20:25.488 --> 01:20:27.056
I mean, sort of.

01:20:30.126 --> 01:20:31.570
Is that weird?

01:20:31.594 --> 01:20:34.397
- Bryant was right about
you, you are a unique person

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.832
with a kind heart.

01:20:37.967 --> 01:20:41.947
Whatever it is you're
feeling, it's okay,

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:44.950
I think the kids have
a movie night planned

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:47.110
maybe we oughta get home and
see what they've picked.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.061
- So this is what a movie
night is really like?

01:21:06.930 --> 01:21:07.930
- Yeah.

01:21:09.565 --> 01:21:10.976
- Cool.

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:32.021
I don't know what
to say to that.

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:37.136
- What's his number?

01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:38.203
I'll text him.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:39.204
- What?

01:21:39.228 --> 01:21:40.228
No.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.065
What are you gonna say?

01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:44.709
- Don't worry.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:45.733
May I?

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.013
- You guys are being too loud.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:49.037
- Sorry.

01:21:58.681 --> 01:21:59.681
- Happy?

01:22:01.117 --> 01:22:03.328
- It's better than
what I would've said.

01:22:04.988 --> 01:22:07.132
- Roni, you've seen this movie
at least a hundred times

01:22:07.156 --> 01:22:08.633
do you really need
us to be quiet?

01:22:08.657 --> 01:22:11.236
- Stop talking now, people.

01:22:12.728 --> 01:22:14.197
- It's her favorite part.

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:19.568
- So this is what a movie
night is really like.

01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:22.181
- Pretty much.

01:22:22.205 --> 01:22:24.640
Popcorn, fighting, and movies
you've seen a hundred times.

01:22:30.213 --> 01:22:31.390
- Hi.

01:22:31.414 --> 01:22:32.724
- Hey, are you okay?

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:34.226
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:35.418
- Bryant said that you...

01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.431
He's being serious, wasn't he?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:40.665
- Yeah.

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.525
- And when you called
you needed my help.

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:45.770
- Yeah.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:48.540
- Indy, I don't
know what to say.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:49.374
I'm an idiot.

01:22:49.398 --> 01:22:51.010
- No, you're not.

01:22:51.034 --> 01:22:53.269
You just had your
own stuff going on.

01:22:54.503 --> 01:22:56.305
Speaking of which,
how's your ankle?

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:02.278
- It's still sore but the doctor
says it's nothing serious.

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:05.557
Just have to take
it easy for awhile.

01:23:05.581 --> 01:23:06.581
- I'm glad.

01:23:09.252 --> 01:23:10.353
- Are you really okay?

01:23:11.454 --> 01:23:15.558
- I mean, Bryant's dad is
taking care of my case, so.

01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:18.427
It's getting there.

01:23:20.563 --> 01:23:21.473
- Can I see you?

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.242
Are you gonna be at school or?

01:23:23.266 --> 01:23:27.646
- I think I'm gonna stay home
but take notes for me, okay?

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:29.081
- Yeah.

01:23:29.105 --> 01:23:31.550
Can I come over after
school just to talk?

01:23:31.574 --> 01:23:32.574
- Sure.

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:37.156
- Indy, I'm really really...

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.180
- I know.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:43.586
- See you tomorrow.

01:23:47.656 --> 01:23:49.401
- Hey, do you have a second?

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:50.269
- Sure.

01:23:50.293 --> 01:23:51.293
Is everything okay?

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:57.400
- Well, I've had a few friends
digging into the paperwork

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:02.738
and apparently your mother had
a $300,000 insurance policy

01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:06.251
that your aunt and uncle took,

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:08.711
as legal guardians,
to raise you.

01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:12.180
- To raise me?

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.320
And they had all this
money the whole time?

01:24:18.354 --> 01:24:21.233
- Did you see any of it?

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:22.257
- Never.

01:24:23.159 --> 01:24:24.159
- That's the issue.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:28.397
- On top of selling everything,
all my mom's stuff?

01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:31.534
- Unfortunately yes.

01:24:33.336 --> 01:24:35.138
But it's all gonna
come up in court.

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.842
- Why did they see
me as such a burden?

01:24:42.645 --> 01:24:43.645
- I'm sorry.

01:24:46.249 --> 01:24:48.393
On the bright side, you
will likely win all

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.330
of that money back and
then some in court.

01:24:51.354 --> 01:24:53.556
It's not gonna look good
for your aunt and uncle.

01:24:54.623 --> 01:24:55.623
- Thank you.

01:25:02.631 --> 01:25:03.799
- The water looks nice.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.271
You feeling any better?

01:25:11.474 --> 01:25:13.485
- I always thought they
treated me the way they did

01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:15.278
because I cost them
too much money.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.747
Now I know that's not the case.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:22.261
- It's their loss,
you have nothing

01:25:22.285 --> 01:25:23.452
but goodness in your heart.

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:27.490
Besides, you didn't deserve
the way they treated you.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.362
- I don't know if I could
ever face them again

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.133
and I have to see Jayda and
Kaitlyn every day at school.

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:42.438
- True. But the school
year's almost over.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.240
It is a big school.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:52.215
With the school year almost
being over there's this thing

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:55.451
that starts with a P.

01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:58.286
- Party?

01:25:59.355 --> 01:26:00.765
- Close.

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:03.635
Prom.

01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.659
- What about it?

01:26:06.962 --> 01:26:07.962
- You should go.

01:26:09.698 --> 01:26:13.245
- Jayda and Kaitlyn have been
preparing for prom for months.

01:26:13.269 --> 01:26:15.747
- Then imagine their
faces when you walk in

01:26:15.771 --> 01:26:17.573
with whatever killer
dress you pick.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:20.819
With me.

01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:22.554
- With you?

01:26:22.578 --> 01:26:23.578
- If you'll go with me.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:25.480
- But my cousins...

01:26:26.849 --> 01:26:29.885
- Well, I just wanted to
go with you, but hey,

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.822
if you wanna make it a group
date with your cousins, then.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:40.405
- Did you really
just ask me to prom?

01:26:40.429 --> 01:26:41.429
- Yeah.

01:26:42.398 --> 01:26:43.398
Yeah, I did.

01:26:44.833 --> 01:26:45.833
- Yes.

01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.547
I can go.

01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:51.416
I don't have to do chores,
I'm not grounded,

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.477
I don't have to make dinner for
my cousins or their dates.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.515
I'd love to.

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:04.596
Do I have to wear a
dress with heels?

01:27:05.821 --> 01:27:08.367
I'll wear the dress
I just, please,

01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:10.369
don't make me wear heels.

01:27:10.393 --> 01:27:13.329
- I'm a guy, I don't care
what shoes you wear.

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:19.611
- Hey, Indy, there's a boy
here who wants to talk to you.

01:27:19.635 --> 01:27:20.669
- Ah.

01:27:21.604 --> 01:27:22.638
Maxton.

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:37.496
- Hi.

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:39.431
- So new digs, huh?

01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:40.656
This place is cool.

01:27:42.057 --> 01:27:44.002
- The Baileys are
really nice people.

01:27:44.026 --> 01:27:46.695
- Yeah, I can't
compete with that.

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:49.641
- What are you talking about?

01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:50.699
- Look, you

01:27:53.068 --> 01:27:54.937
you have Bryant now

01:27:56.705 --> 01:28:01.043
and I'm stupid for not
asking you out sooner.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:06.915
Look, Indy, spending these
last few years with you was

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.653
really a dream come true for me.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.458
You made it worth going
to school every day.

01:28:16.725 --> 01:28:17.536
- Really?

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.037
- Yeah.

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:23.699
I mean, wish I'd done more and
been more of what you needed

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:27.603
but I didn't know what that was.

01:28:28.737 --> 01:28:30.739
- You were exactly
what I needed.

01:28:32.007 --> 01:28:33.585
You helped me through some of

01:28:33.609 --> 01:28:35.544
the hardest times I've ever had.

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.748
You made me forget how
bad my life really was.

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:43.795
- Did you really get removed

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:45.488
from the house because of abuse?

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:49.156
- Yeah.

01:28:49.892 --> 01:28:52.094
- Did they hurt you?

01:28:54.029 --> 01:28:55.407
Why didn't you tell me?

01:28:55.431 --> 01:28:57.733
I coulda helped, I
coulda done something.

01:28:59.402 --> 01:29:05.450
- My case is more emotional
abuse which I didn't know

01:29:05.474 --> 01:29:07.476
you could take
somebody to court for.

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:08.910
But I'm safe now.

01:29:10.879 --> 01:29:12.080
Dr. Bailey's helping me.

01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:14.982
- He seems decent.

01:29:16.885 --> 01:29:17.885
I'm happy for you.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:21.390
Are you gonna change schools or?

01:29:22.791 --> 01:29:24.936
- I thought about it but since Dr.
Bailey

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.797
works at the school I
figured I better stay.

01:29:29.998 --> 01:29:33.702
- Well, I'm glad you're staying
even if it's not with me.

01:29:35.504 --> 01:29:36.114
- Maxton...

01:29:36.138 --> 01:29:37.749
- Hey, it's okay.

01:29:37.773 --> 01:29:39.451
This is the part where
you tell me you're going

01:29:39.475 --> 01:29:42.478
with the handsome prince
and not the regular dude.

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:45.957
- I'm sorry.

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:46.981
- Don't be.

01:29:48.484 --> 01:29:51.463
It might not of been
legit but you were mine

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:54.022
for years and I don't
need more than that.

01:29:55.991 --> 01:30:00.996
- You deserve more than that
and you'll have it some day.

01:30:05.033 --> 01:30:06.033
- Just not with you.

01:30:08.871 --> 01:30:10.573
- You know what you will have?

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:15.687
A best friend.

01:30:15.711 --> 01:30:18.847
Promise me that you'll
stay my best friend.

01:30:20.716 --> 01:30:21.716
- Friends for life?

01:30:22.818 --> 01:30:24.463
- Forever.

01:30:35.230 --> 01:30:37.642
- As I watched him walk away

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.811
I fully expected things to
be awkward here and there

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:42.538
especially if he and Bryant
were in the same room,

01:30:43.739 --> 01:30:47.652
but Maxton has been such a huge
part of my life for so long

01:30:47.676 --> 01:30:49.778
and we were learning now
what love really was.

01:30:50.879 --> 01:30:52.114
I think that'll help us both.

01:30:53.949 --> 01:30:54.949
We'll be fine.

01:30:59.121 --> 01:31:01.666
As luck would have it, Dr.
Bailey wasn't

01:31:01.690 --> 01:31:05.561
just good at his job,
he was really good.

01:31:06.829 --> 01:31:08.973
Between his testimony and
the state's investigation

01:31:08.997 --> 01:31:11.910
my aunt and uncle not
only lost custody of me,

01:31:11.934 --> 01:31:13.645
they were ordered
to make payments

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:16.180
to pay back my mom's
life insurance policy.

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:18.182
As well as another
big sum to make up

01:31:18.206 --> 01:31:21.209
for the missing assets and any
emotional trauma they caused.

01:31:23.278 --> 01:31:25.757
I couldn't touch most
of it until I was 18

01:31:25.781 --> 01:31:29.918
but holy smokes, I was loaded.

01:31:31.787 --> 01:31:34.056
The first thing I did was
get a set of wheels.

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:38.036
Bryant's dad assured
me it was a good deal.

01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.771
He also told me it'd be wise not

01:31:39.795 --> 01:31:41.664
to spend all my money at once.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.568
Funny thing was, I never
cared about the money,

01:31:46.935 --> 01:31:50.973
never even thought I had any,
I only wanted to belong.

01:31:54.777 --> 01:31:57.255
I did move out to the
pool house, though.

01:31:57.279 --> 01:31:59.290
Since Bryant and I were dating

01:31:59.314 --> 01:32:01.283
I figured it was the
right thing to do.

01:32:02.885 --> 01:32:06.831
We all have dreams; some
of us wanna be singers,

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:08.957
dancers, astronauts, whatever,

01:32:10.893 --> 01:32:13.962
after losing my mom
this was mine.

01:32:15.163 --> 01:32:17.900
To have a family again.

01:32:32.715 --> 01:32:34.859
- Wow.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:35.918
- Yeah?

01:32:38.253 --> 01:32:39.631
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not

01:32:39.655 --> 01:32:41.032
doing prom stuff
without me, are ya?

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:41.866
- Dad!

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.367
You and your pictures.

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:46.938
- Yeah, you don't go to
prom without pictures.

01:32:46.962 --> 01:32:47.996
And a little...

01:32:50.699 --> 01:32:51.876
Battery issue.

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.035
Hang on just a sec.

01:32:57.840 --> 01:32:59.842
- Do you know how
beautiful you are?

01:33:01.777 --> 01:33:03.646
- For the first time
I feel beautiful

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:06.615
and that's all because of you.

01:33:07.382 --> 01:33:12.587
- No, not me.

01:33:13.255 --> 01:33:17.860
You've always been this way.

01:33:28.971 --> 01:33:30.939
You know, if it wasn't for Mrs.
Wiggins

01:33:32.307 --> 01:33:34.009
I don't think we'd
be here today.

01:33:35.077 --> 01:33:39.281
So I got you
something, wait here.

01:33:45.921 --> 01:33:47.398
- Oh.

01:33:47.422 --> 01:33:48.957
She's beautiful.

01:33:50.893 --> 01:33:51.893
Thank you.

01:33:55.397 --> 01:33:58.743
This is the happiest
moment of my life.

01:33:58.767 --> 01:33:59.944
- I'm gonna be competing with

01:33:59.968 --> 01:34:02.881
the cat for your
attention, aren't I?

01:34:02.905 --> 01:34:05.984
- She's not the only
reason why I'm happy.

01:34:06.008 --> 01:34:07.886
- Okie doke, problem solved.

01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:08.977
Picture time.

01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:11.756
Oh yeah.

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:14.158
Oh, Bryant's got two dates.

01:34:14.182 --> 01:34:15.182
And nice.

01:34:18.787 --> 01:34:19.787
Ah, nice.

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:22.033
Look at that.

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:24.693
- Roni, get in here.

01:34:27.930 --> 01:34:29.908
- Nice.
- Now you, Dr. Bailey.

01:34:29.932 --> 01:34:31.309
- Oh, okay.

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:32.667
If you insist.

01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:36.414
I think that's the button.
