I can't believe Dr. K. hasn't
called you back about the tests.

Of course he hasn't called
back, he's a doctor.

he looks, okay?

more toxic than cyanide.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.650

no skin breaks.

he ate or drank.

05:36.969 --> 05:39.313
he was working
for a business magazine.

05:39.372 --> 05:42.512
So he wasn't a crusading
international journalist.

05:42.575 --> 05:44.384

He paid for it.

exactly keep in touch.

why come to me in
the first place?

is your family.

on the pipeline

at their UN Mission.

go out after that?

12:16.635 --> 12:18.444
Let me walk you through
the radiation trail.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.713
We got activity from the
dishwasher and the trash.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.583
But, by far,
the most contamination

12:23.642 --> 12:25.087
is the pick-up table
in the kitchen.

12:25.144 --> 12:26.555
Where the busboys get the food.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.387
And this table in the back.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.393
Where we sat.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.922
I had blintzes with sour
cream and apple sauce.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.464
So, what did she have to eat?

12:35.588 --> 12:36.726
She didn't eat.

12:37.623 --> 12:38.693
She didn't eat?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.832
So you're just
telling us this now.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.873
It's irrelevant. You're right.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

12:42.928 --> 12:45.704
Someone must have
followed me from the UN.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.572
Wheeler?
(COUGHING)

12:47.633 --> 12:49.613
LOGAN: We need to talk
to Rebecca and Yuri.

12:49.668 --> 12:52.114
And we need to talk
to them right now.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.048
They found the busboy.

12:55.274 --> 12:56.378
Sit tight.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.120
(SCANNER BEEPING)

13:07.052 --> 13:09.862
The family said he had
nausea, and diarrhea.

13:09.922 --> 13:12.232
First guess,
he perforated his gut

13:12.291 --> 13:13.929
from acute radiation poisoning.

13:14.093 --> 13:17.040
So, that's what Josh has
to look forward to.

13:17.329 --> 13:21.106
He's on a slower progressively
downhill track.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.511
(BEEPING)

13:24.370 --> 13:27.044
MURTAUGH: We got something.
A medicine dropper,

13:27.106 --> 13:30.576
a coffee cup stuffed with
hundreds, very high emissions.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.823
LOGAN: That's
the drop site cup.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.200
This is so unethical.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.472
Yuri trusts me.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.139
Unethical?

13:51.430 --> 13:53.273
Josh, the guy killed a busboy

13:53.332 --> 13:56.643
after paying him two grand
to spike your sour cream.

13:57.036 --> 13:58.310
You don't know him.

13:58.370 --> 13:59.474
Yeah.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.229
This is him.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.078
NYPD.
Hands in the air, Yuri.

14:29.134 --> 14:31.080
(SIRENS WAILING)
Now. Put 'em up!

14:31.136 --> 14:32.274
Turn around.
Turn around.

14:34.640 --> 14:35.846
Bingo!

14:43.515 --> 14:46.291
Of course the UN Mission
denies I'm ex-KGB.

14:46.352 --> 14:47.888
What do you expect?

14:47.953 --> 14:49.864
What do you do for them again?

14:49.922 --> 14:51.629
Economic research.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.766
Josh thinks you're
a consulate lawyer.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.739
No. I told him I had
access to contracts.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.240
He misunderstood.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.741
WHEELER: The funny thing is, our
State Department, has no record

15:00.799 --> 15:03.143
of you working for the
Mission, in any capacity.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.473
Tell me why any of this
is your concern?

15:06.572 --> 15:09.212
Because Josh Lemle has been
poisoned with polonium.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.619
Polonium?

15:15.214 --> 15:16.693
Is this joke?

15:17.216 --> 15:20.891
No, no. It's not a joke.
He's dying.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.759
And you're our prime suspect.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.961
Me? No.

15:26.358 --> 15:28.395
I swear. I swear.

15:29.895 --> 15:31.897
Maybe someone followed
you to the drop-off?

15:31.964 --> 15:32.999
Then followed Josh?

15:33.065 --> 15:35.170
Impossible.
I was very cautious.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.145
We use secret signals.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.207
In the subway, five
transfers, before I surface.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.843
Yeah, you told Josh
you were a spy, right?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.482
So, let me get this straight.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.546
You were with the KGB,
but you didn't make

15:47.613 --> 15:50.116
our four undercover units
by the UN?

15:57.156 --> 16:00.467
Okay, maybe not KGB.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.572
In Russia, everyone spies
on someone, you know.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.041
So you're not KGB?

16:06.098 --> 16:08.237
And you're not
at the UN Mission.

16:09.335 --> 16:13.340
No. I live
in Brighton Beach.

16:14.773 --> 16:19.051
I used to be musician.
Now I'm a piano tuner.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.649
Oh.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.692
YURI: Listen, I want someone
to write this story.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.561
If I approach reporters
as an immigrant,

16:28.620 --> 16:31.430
they walk away.
So I... So I embellish.

16:32.691 --> 16:36.161
What about the info on the
Trans-Afghan pipeline.

16:36.228 --> 16:39.038
I translated articles
from Russian papers.

16:39.431 --> 16:44.176
Blogs. Everything I gave to
him, I took off the web.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.414
A Brighton Beach Walter Mitty.

16:50.743 --> 16:51.983
What do we tell Josh?

16:52.044 --> 16:53.455
Now, wait a minute.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.992
This might not be
the whole story.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.459
Now, I bet Josh
isn't the only one

16:57.516 --> 16:59.052
who fell for his spy games.

16:59.118 --> 17:01.155
Someone might have
followed Yuri to Josh.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.792
He played your friend. I doubt
anyone else fell for his act.

17:05.557 --> 17:08.196
Friend or not, someone
still poisoned him,

17:08.260 --> 17:10.035
or do you think
that's an act too?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.403
WHEELER: I know
you think you owe him,

17:11.463 --> 17:13.170
but Josh hasn't
been straight with us,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.641
especially about Rebecca.

17:15.701 --> 17:18.840
If he keeps telling us that
she couldn't be behind this,

17:18.904 --> 17:20.884
we should look
real hard at her.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.313
JOSH: Here I am,
stringer for everybody.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.225

17:34.053 --> 17:35.589
How was it?

17:35.654 --> 17:37.361
Stick to polonium.

17:43.328 --> 17:47.299
He made us tea, Rebecca and me.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.518
I couldn't keep lying
to my wife and kid.

18:00.546 --> 18:04.688
Look, I'm one of these people
who has the person he marries,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.521
whom he loves, you know?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.895
And the person
he could have married,

18:08.954 --> 18:10.729
whom he never stops loving.

18:10.789 --> 18:12.769
Now, you show me that
person on the street,

18:12.825 --> 18:14.361
I spit on him.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.865
I am him. (LAUGHS)

18:22.167 --> 18:23.840
It's not Rebecca.

18:24.803 --> 18:28.774
Josh, I understand, but
you gotta help me here.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.779
Where is she?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.289
Just tell me,
where is she staying?

18:33.345 --> 18:35.586
Where does she work?
Anything?

18:50.696 --> 18:51.902
We're oh for four.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.001
Rebecca's editor says he
hasn't seen her for days,

18:54.066 --> 18:56.103
and he wants to know
what this is about.

18:56.168 --> 18:57.841
Make that oh for five.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.076
She checked out of the
University Club this afternoon.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.016
We missed her by three hours.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.882
Maybe Josh tipped her off. And she's on the run.
(CELL PHONE BEEPING)

19:06.111 --> 19:07.556
What else is on Josh's list?

19:07.613 --> 19:09.217
Her parents' house,
in Great Neck.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.887
Richie and a squad car
are on the way.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.487
Looks like someone else
got there first.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.328
RICHIE: The car was registered
to Rebecca's father.

19:21.393 --> 19:24.033
Lucky for him he had
a remote-control starter.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.268
So, where's Rebecca?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.867
We're not sure.
We can't get inside.

19:34.106 --> 19:36.017
Is the family in there?
Major Case?

19:36.074 --> 19:37.712
Yeah? Who're you?

19:37.776 --> 19:39.084
Call Ross.

19:39.278 --> 19:40.780
You have no jurisdiction here.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.082
Well, we need to talk
to Rebecca Slater.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.227
Thank you for your help, Detective.
We'll take it from here.

19:46.285 --> 19:47.787
(CHUCKLES) Don't give me
that line.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.662
What are you, creep?

19:56.461 --> 19:57.599
Jeez.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.171
All of a sudden
the men in black

20:01.233 --> 20:02.769
are crawling out
of the woodwork.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.906
They knew all along,
Josh was never the target.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.684
It's Rebecca.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.014
The Feds won't confirm or deny

20:16.081 --> 20:18.755
Rebecca was at her parents'
home when the bomb went off.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.763
They won't confirm
or deny an investigation.

20:20.819 --> 20:23.163
Oh, boy,
that's some cooperation.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.826
They're not looking
for cooperation,

20:24.890 --> 20:26.164
they've told us to back off.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.260
And are we?

20:27.326 --> 20:29.897
We're proceeding
on a separate track.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.265
You need to go back
to your friend Josh.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.870
And what? Tell him that
he's collateral damage?

20:38.136 --> 20:40.412
You need to tell him the truth.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.486
Yuri's a fake and Rebecca
was the actual target.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.685
That's not really a call
I wanna make.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.623
We need to know if she
told him about any stories

20:49.681 --> 20:50.716
she's been working on.

20:54.519 --> 20:56.556
You want me to talk to him?

20:57.422 --> 20:58.526
No.

20:59.791 --> 21:03.170
Guy had my back when everyone
else hung me out to dry.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.473
Lowe him.

21:09.968 --> 21:12.744
I'm dying because
someone made a mistake?

21:13.705 --> 21:15.776
What about Yuri, my story?

21:15.841 --> 21:19.379
I'm sorry, man. That guy
wasn't what he claimed to be.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.359
How can you be sure Rebecca...

21:23.415 --> 21:27.261
Someone tried to kill her
tonight, with a car bomb.

21:27.552 --> 21:28.860
(EXHALES)

21:30.589 --> 21:32.262
Is she all right?
WHEELER: We don't know.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.634
The Feds wouldn't
let us talk to her.

21:34.693 --> 21:36.400
Josh, what was her story about?

21:39.231 --> 21:43.145
She'd never tell me.
We were lovers, but...

21:44.202 --> 21:46.011
(COUGHING)

21:48.173 --> 21:50.847
But, if she had a big story,
I would have to find out

21:50.909 --> 21:52.855
about it on TV,
just like everyone else.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.023
Could you email her?

22:15.600 --> 22:17.238

22:19.638 --> 22:21.276

I'm Detective Wheeler.

Josh is on his way.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.522
Son of a bitch.
He set me up?

22:26.712 --> 22:29.386
We pressured him.
Just a few questions.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.994
Same thing I told the FBI.
Forget it.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.661
Rebecca...

22:44.329 --> 22:45.740
(GROANS)

23:00.112 --> 23:01.887
He's gone, isn't he?

23:03.715 --> 23:05.717
There's nothing you can do?

23:05.784 --> 23:07.695
Maybe find his killer.

23:07.753 --> 23:08.959
We need to know
what you're working on.

23:09.020 --> 23:11.523
Who you saw the day
Josh was poisoned?

23:12.924 --> 23:14.096
I gotta get back to work.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.399
Rebecca, you're in danger.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.167
I've been doing this
for 17 years.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.708
I know how to
take care of myself.

23:19.664 --> 23:20.836
Rebecca...

23:23.068 --> 23:24.445
Rebecca!

23:24.503 --> 23:26.915
At least tell us who your
story might be pissing off.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.714
I cover the Middle East
Relationships are complicated.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.686
And your relationship
ended Josh's life.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.689
He deserves to know why.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.859
Are you familiar
with Sarah Myers?

23:41.887 --> 23:44.390
The young teacher from Brooklyn
who was shot by the Israeli army?

23:44.589 --> 23:47.126
Now she's a martyr
for the Palestinians.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.900
Her face, the perfect photogenic
symbol of Israeli brutality.

23:51.062 --> 23:54.236
No offense, but I've seen
100 stories about her.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.912
Not this one.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.906
If I get you something, do
not share it with the FBI.

24:03.742 --> 24:07.588
Sarah Myers, a young International
Teachers for Peace volunteer,

24:07.646 --> 24:09.489
had only been in the West
Bank for a few weeks

24:09.548 --> 24:12.028
when she decided to
approach the Israeli tanks.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.063
She was hoping to
convince the Israeli Army

24:14.119 --> 24:18.124
to spare a Palestinian children's
school from their advancing bulldozers.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.533
What Sarah didn't know

24:19.691 --> 24:22.194
was the Israeli Army
had just received a tip

24:22.260 --> 24:25.833
that a suicide bomber dressed
as a blonde American woman

24:25.897 --> 24:27.467
was going to target them.

24:27.532 --> 24:29.239
They ordered her to halt.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.805
She continued on, flashing
them the peace sign.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.515
Then...

24:35.574 --> 24:36.985
(SCREAMING)

24:40.445 --> 24:45.554
So, Rebecca's saying the
Israelis got a false tip?

24:46.017 --> 24:48.463
That the Palestinians
set Sarah Myers up,

24:48.520 --> 24:49.897
and created their own martyr?

24:49.955 --> 24:52.993
Could be true.
Could be Israeli spin.

24:54.025 --> 24:56.596
Either way, kill
Rebecca, kill the story.

24:57.529 --> 24:59.941
If someone in the Middle
East wanted her dead,

24:59.998 --> 25:01.841
why wait till she got
to New York?

25:01.900 --> 25:04.005
They waited till
she was dining with Josh.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.412
They used polonium.

25:05.604 --> 25:08.084
They wanted to throw suspicion
onto Josh and the Russians,

25:08.139 --> 25:10.346
and away from Rebecca's
report on Sarah Myers.

25:10.408 --> 25:13.412
"They"? On American soil,
who is this "they"?

25:13.812 --> 25:15.951
Al-Qaeda, Syria?

25:16.014 --> 25:17.459
How do you even begin
to count the groups

25:17.516 --> 25:18.722
that wouldn't want
this story to get out?

25:18.783 --> 25:21.093
You don't.
You go the other way.

25:21.152 --> 25:23.758
I know someone who'd love to see
this story lead the evening news.

25:23.822 --> 25:27.497
I wouldn't be surprised if he
was one of Rebecca's sources.

25:28.059 --> 25:31.131
The Palestinians sent
Sarah Myers to her death?

25:31.530 --> 25:33.737
Yes, I know all about it.

25:34.399 --> 25:36.709
And no, it's not Israeli spin.

25:37.168 --> 25:40.706
It's true. And it's also the
last story we want made public.

25:40.839 --> 25:44.878
Back-up. You're the Chair of
the US-Israel Friendship PAC.

25:44.943 --> 25:46.854
You're telling me, you
want the story kept quiet?

25:46.978 --> 25:48.616
What's done is done.

25:48.680 --> 25:51.456
I'm asking you as an old
friend, let this one go.

25:51.516 --> 25:54.622
I can't do that, Artie.
It's a murder investigation.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.063
Not yours.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.602
Our understanding is the Feds
have asserted jurisdiction.

26:01.626 --> 26:02.730
Where'd you hear that?

26:02.794 --> 26:04.239
It's my job.

26:04.829 --> 26:08.276
Now, I'm asking you as a Jew,
and as a friend of Israel,

26:08.333 --> 26:10.279
don't let this story out.

26:12.037 --> 26:14.210
I'll take it under advisement.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.247
Now I have a favor to ask you.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.548
You know this guy?

26:17.609 --> 26:20.021
He was at the scene of a
car bombing last night.

26:20.078 --> 26:22.080
What agency?
That, nobody knows.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.053
His name is Nick Flanders.

26:24.149 --> 26:26.026
And I believe he's on our side.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.424
What side is that?

26:31.256 --> 26:34.260
USA, Danny. USA.

26:35.694 --> 26:36.695
(LAUGHS)

27:10.829 --> 27:12.866
I need you both inside now.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.279
Close the door, please.

27:22.340 --> 27:25.378
Okay stuff your notes in your desk.
We move on.

27:26.711 --> 27:27.985
It's our case.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.719
Not anymore.
Now, wait a minute,

27:29.781 --> 27:31.158
I'm not closing out this case.

27:31.216 --> 27:32.820
Your friend Josh
has been an obstacle

27:32.884 --> 27:34.921
to his own murder
investigation from the get.

27:35.687 --> 27:37.496
He won't even tell us
what Rebecca told him,

27:37.555 --> 27:39.432
because he's
protecting his story.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.936
Let me go back to Rebecca.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.303
Rebecca won't talk. The
Feds have blocked us out.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.842
Even the Israeli government,
who you'd have to think

27:46.898 --> 27:49.139
would be interested
in clearing their name,

27:49.200 --> 27:50.611
even they want us to drop this.

27:50.669 --> 27:52.046
What, your PAC guy
told you that?

27:52.470 --> 27:54.882
Come again? Is that what
this is about? Israel?

27:54.939 --> 27:56.179
Logan!
Wait a minute.

27:56.241 --> 27:58.619
Are you afraid that Israel is gonna
look worse than it already does?

27:59.744 --> 28:00.882
We've been ordered off.

28:00.945 --> 28:04.119
By who?
The Feds? Or Israel?

28:04.616 --> 28:05.686
Let me ask you something.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.356
On this one, are you a Jew
first and a cop second?

28:08.687 --> 28:10.758
Is that the story? We're
done here, Logan.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.729
There are good guys, and
there are bad guys here.

28:16.961 --> 28:19.635
We're dealing with car
bombs, terrorists.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.201
Hamas, PLO, they blow people up

28:22.267 --> 28:24.975
in cafes, buses,
shopping malls.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.204
Who are you kidding?

28:26.271 --> 28:30.014
You think Sarah Myers is the first
innocent the Israelis have killed?

28:32.577 --> 28:34.386
Captain. Logan.

28:36.114 --> 28:38.594
Thank you for your help,
Detectives.

28:38.650 --> 28:40.220
We're off this case.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.597
Miriam's coming in.

28:47.659 --> 28:51.368
We're gonna decide if I should
die in a hospital or at home.

28:51.930 --> 28:54.103
Go home to your wife and kid.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.177
We've been called off.

28:58.236 --> 29:01.809
I'm not even sure if the Feds
want this solved or buried.

29:03.308 --> 29:04.446
(SIGHS)

29:04.509 --> 29:06.455
(SCOFFS) You heard from Rebecca?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.351
Deep background?

29:11.082 --> 29:14.188
She's trying to tie my
poisoning into her story.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.996
She's meeting someone at a
safe house in Brooklyn.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.903
A friend of Sarah Myers

29:20.959 --> 29:23.565
from the
International Teachers.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.431
Where is this safe house?

29:27.098 --> 29:28.577
I'll get my chair.
We'll go.

29:28.633 --> 29:31.045
Josh, go home.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.117
It's my turn to help you.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.819
Captain was asking
where you were.

29:44.883 --> 29:47.056
Yeah? You tell him?

29:47.118 --> 29:50.361
No. I'm your partner. But
he wants us off the case.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.294
Well, all I was doing was
visiting a sick friend.

29:53.358 --> 29:54.530
The Captain's feeling is,

29:54.592 --> 29:56.833
if your friend was as loyal to
his wife, as you are to him...

29:56.928 --> 29:59.169
(SCOFFS) Oh, is that what
the captain was thinking?

29:59.230 --> 30:02.074
Jeez, if only life were
so neat and simple.

30:02.600 --> 30:06.548
Look, I have a 10-year gap in
my relationship with Josh.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.450
And the only reason Josh
was going to meet Rebecca,

30:09.507 --> 30:11.043
was so that he could
break it off with her.

30:11.543 --> 30:12.681
Okay.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.723
I gotta get out of here.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.250
Listen to this.

30:18.316 --> 30:20.694
Josh says that Rebecca's
doing an interview

30:20.752 --> 30:23.961
with one of Sarah Meyer's
friends, in a safe house.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.864
A friend of Sarah Meyer's? Yeah.

30:26.925 --> 30:29.269
Here?
Yeah.

30:31.896 --> 30:33.671
I'll get our coats.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.954
CSU and the ME
are on their way.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.021
Poor Josh.

30:48.379 --> 30:52.122
The last thing he needs to hear
is that he outlived Rebecca.

31:03.228 --> 31:04.502
DR. RODGERS:
She was defenestrated.

31:04.562 --> 31:07.008
Not just out the window,
but through it.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.806
The ligature marks
on her wrists and ankles

31:08.867 --> 31:10.107
indicate two people did it.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.512
Dr. Rodgers...

We're barely done testing.
They're kicking us out.

31:30.388 --> 31:31.799
Detectives.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.666
Sorry you made
a pointless trip.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.604
You got here awfully fast.

31:37.662 --> 31:38.970
And a little too late.

31:39.030 --> 31:41.271
You should have called us the
second you got the address.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.307
I didn't realize
we were coordinating.

31:43.601 --> 31:45.706
We're not.
You're done here.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.674
Isn't that right, Captain?

31:51.976 --> 31:54.582
Actually, Mr. Flanders, there's
been a change of plan.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.956
We're going to have to share
jurisdiction after all.

32:01.019 --> 32:02.464
I need a word with you.

32:08.226 --> 32:09.569
Excuse me.

32:10.795 --> 32:13.833
Hey, Murtaugh, I need a favor.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.242
We have a protocol, Captain.

32:16.301 --> 32:18.076
Our agreement was
for the Lemle case.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.843
Until I get a call
from my commissioner,

32:19.904 --> 32:21.406
this is a NYPD crime scene.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.384
What are you doing?

32:30.548 --> 32:33.392
This laptop's registering
high alpha rays.

32:34.152 --> 32:35.859
How long were you
handling this?

32:35.920 --> 32:37.126
Excuse me?

32:37.188 --> 32:38.929
MURTAUGH: Sir, you may
have been contaminated.

32:38.990 --> 32:40.333
Captain Ross, step aside.

32:40.391 --> 32:43.099
We need to get you down to the
Medical Command Center right away.

32:57.575 --> 32:59.577

33:01.813 --> 33:03.884
That's weird.
He's not popping at all.

33:03.948 --> 33:06.155
Well, better safe than sorry.

33:06.217 --> 33:07.321
Where's my laptop?

33:07.385 --> 33:09.991
Rebecca's?
It tested clean too.

33:10.054 --> 33:11.431
The hard drive was scrubbed.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.868
Someone overwrote data on the
swap partition. Seven times.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.061
Meaning what?

33:16.127 --> 33:18.573
I thought you'd know. It's the new
Department of Defense standard.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.566
Get me the laptop, Detectives.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.945
It's on its way, Nick.
Oh, by the way,

33:23.001 --> 33:25.379
the Captain sends regards
from a mutual friend.

33:25.436 --> 33:27.712
Artie. Artie Abelson.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.744
From the Israeli PAC?

33:29.807 --> 33:31.286
Not a name I'm aware of.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.423
That's strange, he's aware of yours.
He fed it to us.

33:34.946 --> 33:36.789
Proves he's not my friend.

33:37.148 --> 33:38.525
Ah.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.531
ROSS: Why was Nick Flanders
at the crime scene?

33:44.589 --> 33:47.729
ARTIE: Best guess?
Coming to broker a deal.

33:47.792 --> 33:48.793
A deal?

33:48.860 --> 33:51.101
Danny, breaking news.

33:51.162 --> 33:54.405
Reporters will write
for fame or principle.

33:54.465 --> 33:58.607
But they're sometimes willing
to not write for cold cash.

33:59.437 --> 34:03.078
Obviously someone who didn't
believe in negotiation

34:03.608 --> 34:05.053
beat Nick to the meeting.

34:05.443 --> 34:08.014
So Rebecca Slater
had hard evidence

34:08.079 --> 34:09.558
vindicating those
Israeli soldiers?

34:09.880 --> 34:13.021
She did.
Naive Sarah Myers,

34:13.083 --> 34:17.396
in her glorious Palestinian
Solidarity red scarf,

34:17.822 --> 34:19.301
was set up to be martyred.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.533
Then why wouldn't you or your
PAC or the State of Israel

34:23.594 --> 34:24.833
want the whole world
to know that?

34:25.163 --> 34:26.608
Because if people dig around,

34:26.664 --> 34:30.612
they're also gonna learn that Sarah
Myers was a mole for Mossad.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.047
Israeli Secret Service.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.576
Israel inadvertently shot
their own spy,

34:37.641 --> 34:39.588
and turned her into
a Palestinian martyr.

34:45.183 --> 34:48.687
Tell me that doesn't say
Middle East all over it.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.969
Okay, so either the Palestinians
didn't want it revealed

34:55.025 --> 34:57.063
that Sarah was an Israeli spy.

34:57.128 --> 35:03.602
Or the Israelis didn't want their
spy nest disclosed. Is that it?

35:04.035 --> 35:05.776
We're still not sure
if Rebecca even knew

35:05.837 --> 35:07.510
Sarah Myers was an Israeli spy.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.519
She knew.
Right, Josh?

35:12.810 --> 35:16.553
This isn't a big surprise
to you, is it?

35:18.149 --> 35:19.594
Because you have
Rebecca's notes.

35:24.889 --> 35:29.099
At our last supper at Vechera,

35:29.827 --> 35:32.103
we were talking shop and she

35:33.331 --> 35:36.005
let it slip that she had
a cyber storage account.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.645
So, when you told me
she was the target,

35:38.703 --> 35:43.083
I... (CHUCKLES)
I guessed her password.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.347
You guessed it?

35:44.408 --> 35:48.948
We had a dog in Chechnya

35:49.647 --> 35:51.285
named Pucinella.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.957
I got it on the first try.

36:05.796 --> 36:08.709
Okay. If Josh could get
into her cyber account,

36:08.766 --> 36:10.677
her killers could too.

36:10.935 --> 36:13.779
When did Josh and Rebecca
make their date?

36:14.105 --> 36:17.575
Over a month ago. They kept
a private email account.

36:17.975 --> 36:21.422
So they thought. The killers
knew her whole schedule.

36:21.479 --> 36:22.617
They could have struck
at anytime.

36:22.680 --> 36:25.251
They purposefully chose
her dinner with Josh,

36:25.316 --> 36:27.887
and polonium, to throw
suspicion onto Russia,

36:27.952 --> 36:29.932
and off of the Middle East.

36:29.987 --> 36:32.433
Then all they had to do
was bribe the busboy.

36:32.490 --> 36:35.164
How did they know
which busboy to go to?

36:35.226 --> 36:38.366
I mean, this was too well planned
for them to leave that to chance.

36:38.429 --> 36:39.567
You're right.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.405
They would've planted someone
else in the restaurant.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.806
It's a small staff.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.404
All long-term employees.

36:45.469 --> 36:48.109
I can't picture any of them
collaborating with terrorists.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.819
Well, there's
another possibility.

36:52.276 --> 36:54.278
Maybe somebody was duped.

36:59.283 --> 37:03.231
LOGAN: We think your busboy was paid
by someone to plant the polonium.

37:03.588 --> 37:06.159
Do you recognize
any of these people?

37:06.857 --> 37:08.427
Maybe friends of Willy's?

37:13.097 --> 37:14.974
I'm sorry, I don't.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.503
That's a beautiful ring.

37:18.603 --> 37:20.207
From your boyfriend?

37:20.271 --> 37:25.152
Leo. I've never had much
luck with guys, till now.

37:26.210 --> 37:27.746
Do you have
any pictures of him?

37:27.812 --> 37:30.418
No. We only met
three weeks ago.

37:32.617 --> 37:34.119
When's the last time
you saw him?

37:35.319 --> 37:36.559
Last week.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.965
He had some family
problem to deal with.

37:39.690 --> 37:40.760
Mmm.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.964
You have his address? Maybe
his cell phone number?

37:44.028 --> 37:45.666
Queens, somewhere.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.099
I have his
cell phone memorized.

37:48.332 --> 37:50.403
Oh, could you write it down?

37:53.070 --> 37:56.074
Leo's a good guy.
And he has his Green card.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.518
He's a gentleman.
Big tipper?

37:58.909 --> 38:01.150
Oh, yeah.
He'd tip me double.

38:01.612 --> 38:03.421
Willy, my busboy,
he'd tip him triple.

38:04.115 --> 38:08.086
Leo, he drives a limo, so he
understands the service industry.

38:08.152 --> 38:11.292
He used to walk me to the
ATM to deposit my cash.

38:11.756 --> 38:12.894
Which ATM?

38:12.957 --> 38:15.938
The one around the corner
from the restaurant.

38:19.430 --> 38:20.636
NICK: How'd you get
this photo?

38:20.698 --> 38:21.836
WHEELER: Leg work.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.640
We checked cash machines
near the restaurant.

38:23.701 --> 38:25.772
Crosschecked photos
with the staff.

38:25.836 --> 38:27.611
He was there.
He didn't eat.

38:27.672 --> 38:30.118
Okay, this is a good lead.

38:30.374 --> 38:31.478
Thank you.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.045
Oh. Hey, Nick. We didn't
have to call you.

38:34.111 --> 38:36.489
So, one hand washes the other here.
You know what I mean?

38:36.914 --> 38:40.191
This is an espionage matter involving
information sensitive to the US.

38:40.384 --> 38:43.888
Sensitive? We have a US citizen
sitting in the basement

38:43.954 --> 38:45.900
about to go into
total organ failure.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.765
His blood's on your hands.

38:47.825 --> 38:49.202
So screw
the political fall-out.

38:49.260 --> 38:50.864
I want to know his name.

38:52.797 --> 38:53.901
Okay.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.009
The name we have
is Leo Brezner.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.745
Sometimes he uses
Andreas Mirko.

39:00.104 --> 39:02.084
An international terrorist,
sometime hit man.

39:03.174 --> 39:05.051
Travels with
a Maltese passport.

39:10.948 --> 39:12.291
Thanks.

39:15.152 --> 39:18.463
Leo's cell phone. Last used
Friday at Newark Airport.

39:20.891 --> 39:22.336
We checked every Limo
on the concourse,

39:22.393 --> 39:24.031
and then someone
remembers this Town Car

39:24.095 --> 39:26.006
has been parked
an awful long time.

39:26.230 --> 39:27.903
Forty bucks a day.

39:28.432 --> 39:30.207
I found him slumped
over the steering wheel.

39:30.267 --> 39:32.178
And he's barely alive.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.181
Doesn't look like your guy.

39:42.446 --> 39:44.255
It's an old picture.

39:47.351 --> 39:51.629
I was instructed not to care about
the woman reporter's companion.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.497
She was the contract,
so when she didn't eat,

39:57.328 --> 39:59.501
I tracked her down,
fulfilled it.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.201
How did you know the waitress?

40:01.265 --> 40:03.541
I told her she had pretty eyes.

40:03.934 --> 40:05.845
Bought her a fake emerald.

40:05.903 --> 40:07.883
She introduced me
to her busboy.

40:07.938 --> 40:11.147
Who you bought with cash?
How did you get infected?

40:11.208 --> 40:12.949
They must have poisoned me,

40:13.010 --> 40:14.717
when they gave me the polonium.

40:15.379 --> 40:16.756
Who's "they"?

40:17.448 --> 40:18.984
Does it matter?

40:21.252 --> 40:24.699
They killed you, too. Why
would you protect them now?

40:28.926 --> 40:32.840
There were two
businessmen in Germany.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.570
Said they were Russians.

40:35.633 --> 40:38.443
But these days, who knows?

40:44.175 --> 40:48.089
(WHEEZING) Could be Hamas...
To stop the story.

40:49.046 --> 40:53.722
Or Syria, or Israel,

40:55.152 --> 40:56.961
for its own reasons.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.926
Rebecca would have
figured this out.

41:00.991 --> 41:02.561
I'm not in her league.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.940
She thought you were.

41:05.262 --> 41:06.468
Right.

41:07.264 --> 41:10.370
LOGAN: Hey, Josh. It's no
accident that Rebecca mentioned

41:10.434 --> 41:12.778
her cyber storage
account to you.

41:13.671 --> 41:15.309
If anything was
gonna happen to her,

41:15.372 --> 41:17.545
she wanted you
to finish her story.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.589
Logan?

41:22.346 --> 41:23.484
Yeah.

41:23.948 --> 41:25.325
Thank you.

41:31.455 --> 41:32.798
